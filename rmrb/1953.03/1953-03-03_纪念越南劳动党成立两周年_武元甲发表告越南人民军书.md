Xinhua News Agency, Second Dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency: To commemorate the second anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Workers' Party, General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, issued a letter to the People's Army.

    Vo Nguyen Giap began by saying: Our army is the people's army led by the working class, and it has been continuously nurtured, educated, and led by President Ho Chi Minh and the Party. It is precisely because of this leadership that our army has rapidly grown and become a powerful army. We have achieved considerable success in learning and combat; we have been tempered in ideological style, tactics, technology, and class standpoint; and in the years of resistance war, we have annihilated more than 250,000 enemy troops, expanded guerrilla warfare, and maintained a proactive advantage on the battlefields of North Vietnam.

    Vo Nguyen Giap called on all cadres and soldiers of the People's Army to further enhance the spirit of criticism and self-criticism in order to strengthen the heroic fighting will to actively annihilate the enemy, to further understand the Party's policies and strive to implement them without compromise.

    Vo Nguyen Giap finally called on the People's Army to implement the policy of mobilizing the peasants. He pointed out: This year, President Ho Chi Minh, the Central Committee of the Labor Party, the Vietnamese government, and the Vietnam National United Front have decided to mobilize the peasants, to fight for their rights and cultivate the strength of the resistance war. In order to truly be worthy of the title of the people's army composed of the majority of peasants and led by the working class, we must strive to study and implement this decision of the Party and resolutely support and participate in the large-scale peasant struggle that is about to come.

    纪念越南劳动党成立两周年
    武元甲发表告越南人民军书
    【新华社二日讯】据越南通讯社讯：为纪念越南劳动党成立两周年，越南人民军总司令武元甲将军发表告人民军书。
    武元甲首先说：我们的军队是由工人阶级领导的人民的军队，它不断地得到胡志明主席和党的培养、教育和领导。正是由于这种领导，我们的军队迅速地壮大并成为一支强有力的军队。在学习上和战斗上已获得不少成就；在思想作风、战术技术和阶级立场等方面都得到锻炼；在几年来的抗战中，我们歼灭了二十五万以上的敌人有生力量，扩展了游击战争，并在北越的战场上保持了主动的优势。
    武元甲号召人民军全体干部和战士，进一步地提高批评和自我批评的精神，以便加强积极歼灭敌军的英勇战斗意志，进一步地体会党的政策并不折不扣地努力来执行它。
    武元甲最后号召人民军贯彻关于发动农民的政策。他指出：今年，胡志明主席、劳动党中央、越南政府、越南国民联合战线已经决定发动农民，为他们争取权利和培养抗战的力量。为了真正无愧于由大多数农民组成而由工人阶级领导的人民军队的称号，我们必须努力学习并执行党的这一个决定，坚决支持和参加到这就要到来的大规模的农民斗争中去。
