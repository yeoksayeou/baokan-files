Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 27th: The Korean Central News Agency published a report on the 25th from its East Line reporter stating that from March 11th to 16th, the American aggressor troops repeatedly scattered germ-carrying insects such as flies, mosquitoes, fleas, spiders, and rats at several locations in the counties of Huaiyang, Gao Cheng, Tongchuan, Changdao, and Jin Gang in Jiangyuan Province on seven occasions. They also fired a gas bomb at our military positions.

In Shanyue Village, Jin Gang County, after scattering germ-carrying spiders and rats on March 2nd, the enemy scattered germ-carrying poisonous insects again at dawn on March 11th. On the snow-covered ground, more than one meter deep, people found a four-compartment shell dropped by the enemy and a batch of black flies and fleas feebly trembling.

On the night of March 12th, enemy B-26 aircraft dropped fleas in Liudong Village, Tongchuan County. On the same night, an enemy aircraft dropped four piles of flies and mosquitoes in the Yunqian Village (transliterated) area of Gao Cheng County.

At 3:00 AM on the morning of March 16th, enemy aircraft dropped three piles of fleas in Yuyi Village, Huaiyang County, while dropping leaflets. On the same evening, enemy aircraft dropped rats in the Xinlin Village (transliterated) area of Tongchuan County.

The American aggressor troops simultaneously scattered germ-carrying poisonous insects and fired gas bombs at our front-line positions. At about 6:10 AM on the 16th, enemy B-26 aircraft dropped flies, mosquitoes, and spiders on a certain ridge north of our military positions. At about 1:30 PM on the same day, enemy troops used a 105mm cannon to fire 30 gas bombs at the positions of a certain unit of our army.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 27th: In the past month, the American aggressors have continuously used gas bombs on the Korean front. According to preliminary statistics, the enemy has been found to have used poison gas more than ten times, firing approximately sixty to seventy gas bombs in total. These gas bombs are mostly tear gas, asphyxiating gas, and poisonous gas with strong toxicity. When using gas bombs, the enemy often releases them at night or simultaneously with ordinary shells to cover up their crimes.

In the week after February 25th, the enemy fired more than ten gas bombs at our army positions between Wendengli and Jincheng on the eastern front in three instances. On the night of February 28th, the enemy fired more than 30 shells at the eastern mountain of Longyan Ridge northeast of Jincheng, several of which were asphyxiating gas bombs. At about 11:00 AM on March 3rd, the enemy shelled our army positions 400 meters north of Kehuli, southeast of Jincheng, with 43 rounds, eight of which were irritant gas bombs. The shell casing of this type of gas bomb is the size and shape of a tin can, and the shell skin has the markings "M3MH5". After the bomb lands, it does not explode but emits dense yellow smoke from an iron pipe inside the bomb.

From March 16th to 20th, the enemy fired gas bombs at our army positions southeast of Gao Cheng on the eastern front three times. At noon on the 16th, the enemy fired more than 30 tear gas and asphyxiating gas bombs at Highland 1049.4 north of Xixili northeast of Wendeng. This bomb emitted white smoke after it exploded, and the crater was 3 meters in diameter and 0.7 meters deep. At 2:00 PM on the 20th, the enemy shelled our army positions on Jiuxian Peak from Minglundong southeast of Gao Cheng with 23 rounds, more than ten of which were gas bombs. This bomb split open upon landing, emitting smoke of various colors such as red, yellow, black, and white.

On March 18th and 19th, the enemy fired gas bombs at our army positions at Doulifeng northwest of Jinhua and Western Mountain on the central front several times. This bomb released colorless smoke after it exploded, with a smell like distiller's grains and rotten apples.

    侵朝美军继续进行细菌战使用毒气弹
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】朝鲜中央通讯社二十五日发表该社东线记者的报道说：在三月十一日到十六日的期间，美国侵略军在江原道淮阳、高城、通川、昌道、金刚等郡的几个地点接连七次撒布了苍蝇、蚊子、跳蚤、蜘蛛等带菌的虫子和老鼠等，并对我军阵地发射了一次毒气弹。
    在金刚郡山月里，敌军继三月二日撒布带菌的蜘蛛和老鼠以后，又在三月十一日天将破晓时对该地撒布带菌毒虫。在该地积雪一公尺多深的雪地上，人们发现有敌人投下的一个四格的弹壳和一批无力地颤动着的黑色苍蝇和跳蚤。
    三月十二日夜，敌B—二十六型飞机在通川郡柳洞里投下了跳蚤。同夜，敌机一架在高城郡云前里（译音）一带投下了四堆苍蝇和蚊子。
    三月十六日晨三时，敌机在淮阳郡榆邑里，和投掷传单同时，投下了三堆跳蚤。同日晚间，敌机在通川郡新林里（译音）一带投下了老鼠。
    美国侵略军同时向我军前线阵地撒布带菌毒虫并发射毒气弹。十六日六时十分许，敌B—二十六型飞机在我军阵地北面的某岭投下了苍蝇、蚊子与蜘蛛。同日午后一时三十分许，敌军用一零五糎的炮，向我军某部阵地发射了三十发毒气弹。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】在最近一个月内，美国侵略者连续在朝鲜前线使用毒气弹。据初步统计，发现敌人施放毒气十多次，共放射毒气弹约六、七十枚。这些毒气弹多半是有强烈毒质的催泪性、窒息性和中毒性的毒气。敌人在施放毒气弹时，为了掩盖其罪证，常常是在黑夜施放，或与普通炮弹同时放射。
    在二月二十五日以后的一周内，敌人向东线文登里到金城之间的我军阵地放射毒气弹三次共十多枚。二月二十八日夜，敌军向金城东北龙岩岭东山发射炮弹三十多发，里面有数发是窒息性毒气弹。三月三日十一时许，敌人向金城东南科湖里以北四百多公尺的我军阵地炮击四十三发，其中有八发是刺激性毒气弹。这种毒气弹的弹壳大小形状如铁皮罐头，弹皮有“M3MH5”的标记。此弹落地后不爆炸而由弹内铁管喷射出浓密的黄烟。
    三月十六日至二十日，敌向东线高城东南我军阵地放射三次毒气弹。十六日中午，敌人向文登东北西希里北一零四九点四高地放射三十多发催泪性和窒息性毒气弹，此弹爆炸后冒出白烟，弹坑直径三公尺，深零点七公尺。二十日下午二时，敌由高城东南明伦洞向九仙峰我军阵地炮击二十三发，其中十多发为毒气弹，此弹落地后即裂开，冒出红、黄、黑、白等多种颜色的烟雾。
    三月十八、十九两日，敌向中线金化西北斗流峰和西方山等我军阵地放射毒气弹数次，此弹爆炸后放散无色的烟，其味如酒糟和烂苹果味。
