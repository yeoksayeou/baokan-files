Xinhua News Agency, New York, 28th -- According to TASS, New York, February 28th: As previously reported, the meetings of the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held on the afternoon of February 25th and the morning of February 26th were adjourned due to no one requesting to speak in the discussion of the Korean issue.

At the afternoon meeting on the 26th, the representatives of Australia, Brazil, and Peru made brief speeches, repeating the old tunes of the US-British bloc representatives who often slandered the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, trying every means to justify the US's intervention in Korea.

Because no one requested to speak on February 27th and 28th, the Political Committee decided to hold its next meeting on March 2nd.

Journalists openly pointed out that the representatives of the US-British bloc are attempting to avoid serious discussion of the Korean issue and continue to oppose the General Assembly passing a resolution that could end the Korean War.

    联大政委会
    继续讨论朝鲜问题
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十八日讯：前已报道，二月二十五日下午及二十六日上午举行的联合国大会政治委员会会议，由于没有人要求在朝鲜问题的讨论中发言而宣告休会。
    在二十六日下午会议上，澳大利亚、巴西和秘鲁代表作了简短的发言，他们重复美英集团代表时常诬蔑苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的老调，想尽各种办法来替美国对朝鲜的干涉行为辩解。
    由于没有人要求在二月二十七日和二十八日发言，政治委员会决定到三月二日再举行下次会议。
    新闻界人士公开指出：美英集团代表企图避免认真地讨论朝鲜问题，并且继续反对大会通过可以结束朝鲜战争的决定。
