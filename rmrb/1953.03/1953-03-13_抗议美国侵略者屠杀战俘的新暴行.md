    Protest Against the New Atrocity of American Aggressors Slaughtering Prisoners of War
    In just eight days, from February 28th to March 7th, the American aggressors, devoid of humanity, successively killed and wounded as many as 85 of our captured personnel in the prisoner-of-war camps on Koje Island, Pongam Island, Yongcho Island, and Jeju Island. This includes the bloody massacre in the Yongcho Island prisoner-of-war camp on March 7th, in which alone 65 of our captured personnel were killed and wounded. These new bloody atrocities continue to prove that, in order to expand the war of aggression against Korea, the American aggressors are stepping up their use of the most brutal means to forcibly detain prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder.
    In order to cover up the bloody crimes of massacring prisoners of war, the American aggressors have constantly fabricated lies about prisoners of war "hanging themselves," prisoners of war "killing each other," prisoners of war "rioting," and "demonstrating," and published a so-called "intelligence report" on January 28th to deceive the people of the world. However, these shameful lies of the American aggressors have been thoroughly exposed by the bloody facts that occurred in prisoner-of-war camps such as Yongcho Island. Even American news agencies cannot but admit that the complete facts of the Yongcho Island bloody massacre are: the US military aggressors in Korea first wounded prisoners of war, and then attacked prisoners of war with chemical weapons of so-called "non-toxic irritants," and then carried out a frenzied massacre of prisoners of war who protested by singing. This once again thoroughly exposed the evil essence of the American aggressors' so-called "respect for the individual will of prisoners of war" and "voluntary repatriation principle."
    In order to implement the sinister policy of "Asians fighting Asians," the American aggressors are transferring our captured personnel to the Syngman Rhee gang under the guise of "voluntary repatriation" to serve as cannon fodder. As early as July and October of last year, the US side secretly handed over 38,000 of our captured personnel to the Syngman Rhee gang under the name of "release." The Syngman Rhee puppet government openly admitted on February 24th the bloody crime of forcing prisoners of war to write blood letters "requesting" to participate in "combat against the Communist army."
    The new crimes of the American aggressors slaughtering prisoners of war are being carried out entirely under the encouragement of the illegal resolution on the Korean issue passed at the Seventh General Assembly of the United Nations. The American aggressors and their accomplices all admit that this illegal resolution is a disguised form of the American aggressors' so-called "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation," which is actually the absurd "principle" of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. According to statistics revealed by American news agencies: from the passage of this illegal resolution by the United Nations, that is, from December 4th of last year to March 7th of this year, American aggressors persecuted prisoners of war 42 times, and 371 of our captured personnel were killed and wounded. These facts further expose the essence of this illegal resolution of the United Nations General Assembly.
    The crimes of the American aggressors continuing to massacre prisoners of war on a large scale in Yongcho Island and other places have completely exposed the hideous face of the butcher with lies in his mouth and blood on his hands, like Eisenhower and his ilk. The peace-loving and righteous people of the whole world must rise up, accuse these butchers, and punish these butchers.

### 抗议美国侵略者屠杀战俘的新暴行

    抗议美国侵略者屠杀战俘的新暴行
    灭绝人性的美国侵略者，从二月二十八日到三月七日短短的八天中，又接连在巨济岛、蜂岩岛、龙草岛和济州岛战俘营打死打伤我方被俘人员达八十五人之多，其中包括三月七日在龙草岛战俘营的血腥大屠杀，仅仅这一次，我方被俘人员就被打死打伤六十五人。这些新的血腥暴行继续证明，美国侵略者为了扩大侵朝战争，正加紧用最残暴的手段强迫扣留战俘充当炮灰。
    美国侵略者为了掩饰它屠杀战俘的血腥罪行，曾不断捏造什么战俘“上吊自杀”、战俘“互相残杀”、战俘“暴动”和“示威”的谎言，并于一月二十八日发表所谓“情报报告”，以欺骗世界人民。但是，美国侵略者这些可耻的谎言，已被龙草岛等地战俘营里发生的血腥事实彻底揭破了。连美国通讯社也不能不承认，龙草岛血腥大屠杀的全部事实是：侵朝美军首先打伤战俘，并以所谓“无毒刺激物”的化学武器向战俘进攻，然后又对用唱歌来表示抗议的战俘进行疯狂的屠杀。这就再一次彻底暴露了美国侵略者的所谓
    “尊重战俘个人意志”、“自愿遣返原则”的罪恶实质。
    美国侵略者为了实行“亚洲人打亚洲人”的险恶政策，正在“自愿遣返”的伪装掩盖下，把我方被俘人员转交给李承晚匪帮充当炮灰。早在去年七月和十月，美方就两次以“释放”为名，将三万八千名我方被俘人员秘密交给了李承晚匪帮。李承晚傀儡政府于二月二十四日已公开承认强迫战俘写血书“要求”参加“对共军作战”的血腥罪行。
    美国侵略者屠杀战俘的新罪行，完全是在联合国第七届大会上通过的关于朝鲜问题的非法决议的怂恿下进行的。美国侵略者及其帮凶们都承认：这一非法决议就是美国侵略者的所谓“自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”实即强迫扣留战俘的荒谬“原则”的改装。据美国通讯社所透露出来的消息统计：从联合国的这个非法决议通过到现在，即从去年十二月四日到今年三月七日这一段时期中，美国侵略者迫害战俘事件就发生四十二次，我方被俘人员被打死打伤达三百七十一人。这些事实，进一步揭露了联合国大会的这一非法决议的本质。
    美国侵略者在龙草岛等地继续大规模屠杀战俘的罪行，把艾森豪威尔之流嘴里扯谎、满手鲜血的一副屠夫的狰狞脸孔完全戳穿了。全世界爱好和平的正义人民必须起来，控告这些屠夫，制裁这些屠夫。
