    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 27th (TASS dispatch): Indonesian newspapers published news from the United States Information Service about the dismissal of the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Cochran. Newspaper commentaries pointed out that Cochran had tried his best to pull Indonesia completely into the American war bloc and interfered in Indonesia's internal affairs and foreign policy.
    The newspapers believe that Cochran's dismissal proves that the U.S. government is dissatisfied with the results of Cochran's efforts to lure Indonesia into the U.S. bloc.
    According to "Kompas," "Cochran's attempt to force Indonesia to accept U.S. aid stipulated by the 1951 Mutual Security Act shows that he completely lacked understanding of the will of the Indonesian people."

    美国撤换驻印尼大使柯克兰
    【新华社讯】塔斯社雅加达二十七日讯：印尼报纸刊载了美国新闻处关于美国驻印尼大使柯克兰被解职的消息。报纸的评论指出，柯克兰曾尽力想把印尼完全拉进美国战争集团，并干涉印尼的内政和外交政策。
    报纸认为，柯克兰的被解职，证明了美国政府不满意柯克兰对于引诱印尼加入美国集团所作努力的结果。
    据“指南针报”说，“柯克兰企图硬使印尼接受一九五一年共同安全法所规定的美援，这说明了他对于印尼人民的意愿是完全缺乏了解的。”
