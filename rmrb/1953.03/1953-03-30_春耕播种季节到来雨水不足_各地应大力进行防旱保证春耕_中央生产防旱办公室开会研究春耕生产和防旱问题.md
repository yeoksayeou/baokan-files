    Spring Ploughing and Sowing Season Approaching and Insufficient Rainfall
    All Regions Should Vigorously Implement Drought Prevention to Guarantee Spring Ploughing
    The Central Production and Drought Prevention Office Holds Meeting to Study Spring Ploughing Production and Drought Prevention Issues

    [Our Newspaper] Currently, most regions are experiencing a lack of rain. In the Northeast region, the southern part of Heilongjiang Province, the western part of Jilin Province, all of Liaoxi and Rehe, and all areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the total rainfall from November of last year to mid-March of this year has mostly been less than 20 millimeters. Generally, rainfall is more than one-third less than the rainfall from the end of 1951 to the same period in 1952. Therefore, winter crops and spring sowing lack the necessary moisture. In the Southwest region, Sichuan and Xikang provinces have only had about 20 millimeters of precipitation in the past four months, causing drought for winter crops, and a widespread lack of water in winter water paddy fields (rice paddies that rely on stored winter water for transplanting). In Yunnan Province, drought was apparent before the end of January due to insufficient rain and snow. Rainfall has gradually increased from February onwards. Guizhou has more rainfall than Yunnan, and these two provinces do not lack rain. Rainfall in other southern provinces is normal.
    The lack of rainfall has significantly impacted spring ploughing and sowing. For example, the drought situation is very severe in Rehe and Liaoxi provinces in the Northeast region. In more than a dozen counties in Liaoxi Province, such as Kaiyuan and Faku, about 80 percent of the topsoil has dried to a depth of five or six inches. In Tongxian Special District, Hebei Province, 1.5 million mu of land cannot be sown because of the lack of rain. In the Southwest region, spring drought has occurred in the Mianyang and Meishan Special Districts of Sichuan Province. In Zhangming County, 30 percent of the wheat has withered and yellowed due to drought, and 60 percent of the winter water paddy fields have dried up. In areas such as Luojiang and Anxian, 60 percent of the winter water paddy fields and 80 percent of the pond water are completely or partially dry. In counties such as Ya'an and Rongjing in Xikang Province, many winter water paddy fields have dried up and cracked. Currently, it is the season for spring ploughing and sowing. Although many regions, such as Liaoxi, Shanxi, Suiyuan, and Inner Mongolia, have taken emergency drought prevention measures after the drought occurred, drought prevention work has not yet been widely implemented in most areas. In order to do a good job in drought prevention and strive for a bumper harvest, areas experiencing drought should pay attention to the following:
        (1) Land in drought-stricken areas that has already been autumn-plowed should be harrowed as soon as possible. Land that has not been autumn-plowed should be shallowly cultivated as soon as possible and harrowed immediately after cultivation to improve the soil's water retention capacity and ensure spring sowing.
    (2) Existing small-scale water conservancy projects that need repair should be thoroughly checked and repaired, and management and maintenance should be strengthened. Local agricultural and water conservancy departments should assist the masses in establishing a dedicated irrigation management system, to conserve water and ensure timely and appropriate irrigation.
    (3) If the masses genuinely need and are willing to build water conservancy projects, and if the manpower, material resources, natural conditions, and technical conditions are all available, the masses can be organized to build them in a planned manner under the unified plan of the local county-level or higher people's government. However, technical guidance must be strengthened, and the effective experience of the masses must be summarized and promoted to ensure project quality and irrigation benefits. The method of contributing labor should be based on a reasonable burden-sharing approach, such as more labor from direct beneficiaries, less labor from indirect beneficiaries, and no labor from non-beneficiaries, or beneficiaries compensating non-beneficiaries for labor costs. Strictly prevent mandatory orders and paternalistic practices, such as stipulating water conservancy construction targets from top to bottom or assigning tasks without studying the actual situation.
    (4) Drought prevention work is a long-term construction undertaking. Some drought prevention and resistance methods that require great effort but yield little results, such as long-distance ice transportation, waterwheels climbing mountains, digging temporary earthen wells, and digging drought pits, should not be promoted, in order to save the masses' time and labor for more effective work.
    Local leading organs should implement the State Council's "Instructions on Mobilizing the Masses to Continue to Carry out Drought Prevention and Resistance Campaigns and Vigorously Promote Soil and Water Conservation Work," immediately mobilize comprehensively, strengthen contact between upper and lower levels, promptly grasp the drought situation and the progress of work, organize sufficient cadres to conduct in-depth and vigorous inspections and promotion, and universally carry out drought prevention movements.

    Xinhua News Agency: In order to effectively implement the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's instructions on spring ploughing production and to guide farmers in doing a good job in this year's spring ploughing production, the Central Production and Drought Prevention Office held a meeting on March 28 to discuss how to lead spring ploughing production and how to specifically inspect and help farmers solve difficulties in spring ploughing production. The meeting also specifically studied the drought situation that has occurred in some areas.
    Zhang Su, Deputy Director of the Central Production and Drought Prevention Office, spoke at the meeting. He believes that based on the current spring ploughing production situation in various regions, it is now necessary to mobilize cadres to persuade farmers to concentrate all their energy on spring ploughing production. All other work that can be postponed should be postponed, that can be reduced should be reduced, and that can be stopped should be stopped. He said that the Central Committee has now issued instructions to make spring ploughing production the overriding central task of rural work today, and all regions must do so.
    The meeting finally decided that from now on, it will strengthen contact with production and drought prevention offices in various regions, and regularly inspect the production and drought prevention situation in various regions. It also decided to hold meetings once a week with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce, the People's Bank of China, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives to study work and promptly help farmers solve the difficulties that need to be solved in spring ploughing production.

    春耕播种季节到来雨水不足
    各地应大力进行防旱保证春耕
    中央生产防旱办公室开会研究春耕生产和防旱问题
    【本报讯】目前各地大都缺雨。东北区黑龙江省的南部、吉林省的西部、辽西和热河的全部，内蒙古自治区全部地区，华北区河北省的北部、山西省的北部和绥远全省，从去年十一月起到今年三月中旬止，降雨总量多不及二十公厘，一般较一九五一年底到一九五二年同期雨量少三分之一以上。因此，冬播作物和春耕播种所需水分都感不足。西南区四川、西康两省，近四个月降水仅二十多公厘，冬作物受旱，冬水田（依靠积蓄冬水插秧的稻田）普遍缺水。云南省在一月底前因雨雪不足，呈露旱象，二月份起雨水渐多，贵州降雨较云南多，这两省都不缺雨。南方其他各省降雨量正常。
    雨水不足的地区，春耕播种已经受到很大影响。例如东北区热河、辽西两省，目前旱象都很严重。辽西省开源、法库等十几县，约有百分之八十的耕地表土已经干下五、六寸深。河北省通县专区有一百五十万亩地，因为不下雨，不能播种。西南区四川省的绵阳、眉山两个专区都发生春旱。彰明县的小麦，受旱枯黄的已达百分之三十，冬水田已经干了百分之六十。罗江、安县等地已有百分之六十的冬水田和百分之八十的塘水全干或半干。西康省的雅安、荣经等县许多冬水田已干涸裂缝。目前已进入春耕播种的季节，虽然有不少地区，如辽西、山西、绥远、内蒙古等地，在发生旱象之后，已经采取了紧急的防旱措施，但大部地区的防旱工作尚未普遍展开。为了作好防旱工作，争取丰收，具有旱象的地区，应当注意以下的事项：
        （一）干旱地区已经秋翻过的土地，应当及早耙地，没有秋翻过的土地，应当及早浅耕并随耕随耙，以提高土壤保水能力，保证春播。
    （二）现有的小型水利工程，需要整修的都要普遍检查整修，并且要加强管理养护工作。各地农业和水利部门，应当协助群众建立专人负责的灌溉管理制度，作到节约用水，保证适时适量灌溉。
    （三）在群众确实需要，愿意兴修水利，而且人力、物力和自然条件、技术条件都具备的情况下，可以在当地县以上人民政府的统一计划下，组织群众有计划地兴修，但必须加强技术指导，并总结推广群众的有效经验，保证工程质量和灌溉效益。出工方式应当采直接受益户多出工，间接受益户少出工，非受益户不出工或受益户补偿非受益户工价等合理负担办法，严格防止自上而下地规定兴修水利数字，或不研究实际情况，随便布置任务等强迫命令、包办代替的作法。
    （四）防旱工作是长期建设事业。有些费力大收效小的防旱抗旱办法，如远程运冰、车水翻山、打临时土井、挖旱坑等，都不应提倡，以节省群众的时间和劳力，用到有效的工作上去。
    各地领导机关，应当贯彻政务院“关于发动群众继续开展防旱抗旱运动并大力推行水土保持工作的指示”，立即全面动员起来，加强上下级的联系，及时掌握旱情及工作进展情况，组织足够的干部，进行深入而有力的检查推动，普遍开展防旱运动。

    据新华社讯：为了切实贯彻中共中央关于春耕生产的指示，领导农民做好今年的春耕生产工作，中央生产防旱办公室在三月二十八日召开会议，对如何领导春耕生产和如何具体检查并帮助农民解决春耕生产中的困难等问题作了讨论，特别对目前部分地区发生的旱象作了研究。
    中央生产防旱办公室副主任张苏在会上讲话。他认为根据当前各地的春耕生产情况，从现在开始必须动员干部说服农民，把一切精力都集中到春耕生产上来，其他一切工作，该缓办的就缓办，该缩小的就缩小，该停止的就停止。他说，现在中央已发出指示，把春耕生产作为今天农村工作的压倒一切的中心任务，各地必须这样做。
    会议最后决定，从现在开始，加强和各地生产防旱办公室联系，随时检查各地生产防旱情况；并确定每周与农业部、林业部、水利部、内务部、商务部、中国人民银行、合作总社等部门，开会研究一次工作，及时帮助农民解决在春耕生产中需要解决的困难问题。
