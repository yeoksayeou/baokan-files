	Maternal and Child Health Work Gradually Developing in Southwest Minority Areas
	Maternal and child health work in minority areas of Southwest China is gradually developing, bringing happiness and healthy lives to the vast number of minority women and children.
	Over the past three years, the People's Government has vigorously carried out maternal and child health work in various minority areas. In addition to establishing maternity stations and maternal and child health centers to provide modern midwifery services to minority women, it has also used methods such as slide shows, picture exhibitions, symposiums, and home visits to introduce maternal and child health knowledge to women of all ethnic groups. At the same time, it has also vigorously trained maternal and child health personnel from various ethnic groups. According to incomplete statistics, the number of midwives trained in the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region alone reached more than 100. Nine maternity stations have also been established in Maoxian and Lixian and other places in the Sichuan Tibetan Autonomous Region. Yunnan Province has established more than 440 maternity stations in minority areas. Most minority areas in Guizhou Province have also established maternity stations, and more than 40 midwives have been trained in Huishui, Langdai, and other places.
	The development of maternal and child health work has enabled women and children of all ethnic minorities to begin to lead happy and healthy lives. The number of women suffering from diseases and infant mortality rates have gradually decreased. Through maternal and child health work, women of all ethnic minorities have gradually understood some health knowledge. Tibetan women in the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region used to be universally driven to the wild, horse pens, or cattle pens to give birth. The phenomenon that women did not use menstrual belts during menstruation has now changed.
