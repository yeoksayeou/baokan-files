    Introduction to a Small-Scale Exhibition of North China Newspapers
    Hong Qun
    The Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, during the Third North China Provincial and Municipal Newspaper Work Conference held in early January, organized a small-scale newspaper exhibition. The purpose of this exhibition was to provide the participants with some reference materials to help them better address the central topic to be discussed at the conference: how newspapers should further delve into reality, connect with the masses, and effectively report on large-scale economic construction.
    The materials for this exhibition were partly collected by the Newspaper and Current Affairs Propaganda Division of the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau from the daily inspection of newspapers in the North China region, and partly compiled by the editorial departments of various newspapers. All the exhibition materials were divided into two main categories: The first category was news, communications, editorials, propagandist speeches, popular textbooks, Q&As, discussions, investigations, symposiums, columns, pictures, cartoons, etc., that had achieved certain results in propaganda. This category of exhibits demonstrated how newspapers should deeply reflect reality and guide reality. The first part of this category was reports on advanced experiences in industrial and agricultural production. For example, the Hebei Daily's report in June of last year on "Shijiazhuang Railway Factory Foundry Worker Liu Xizhen and others successfully created the lost foam casting method" completely explained the significance, role, and operation method of the lost foam casting method, and vividly reflected the process of struggle between advanced and conservative ideas; this report played a significant role in improving the ideological awareness of the majority of workers and promoting production. To illustrate the reasons for the success of this report, the article "Talking about How Reporters Delve into Reality from the Report on Liu Xizhen's Lost Foam Method" written by the newspaper's reporter Mi Rongyun was also exhibited. The article introduced his interview process, saying that he felt that the old casting method could no longer meet the needs of machine tool processing, and if no method was found to improve it, it would inevitably affect the development of the machine industry; therefore, after discovering the lost foam casting method created by workers Liu Xizhen and others, he changed the original reporting plan and decided to prominently report this creation. He first repeatedly consulted and studied with labor models, workers, and technicians from the Shijiazhuang Railway Factory, the Repair Shop, and the farm implement factory, understood the technical principles of this casting method, and then proactively explained the role and significance of this creation to the person in charge of the Railway Factory, and with their support and assistance, mobilized and organized technicians and workers to summarize it technically and theoretically. Comrade Mi Rongyun wrote this good report under such conditions of connecting with the masses. The second part of the exhibits explained that if newspapers want to reflect reality and guide reality, they must not only come into contact with various things, but also be good at grasping the essential issues through complex phenomena and propose solutions to problems. For example, the Shanxi Daily's communication published in November of last year, "'How the Problems in the 'Problem Basket' Were Solved' – A Record of the Growth of Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative," vividly introduced their experience in discovering and solving problems through narrating the development of the cooperative. The third part of the exhibits was reports on reflecting the new ideas and new lives of the people. For example, Tianjin Daily's continuous reports on the construction of workers' dormitories and Hebei Daily's comic strip on "A Story of a Member of an Agricultural Production Cooperative" all showed that the people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, were building their new lives with infinite wisdom and resolute efforts. These reports undoubtedly served as an encouragement to the masses.
    The second category of exhibition materials consisted of generalized or flawed and erroneous reports. These materials pointed out where and why newspapers were divorced from reality and unable to effectively reflect and guide reality. The first part of this category of exhibits explained that without conducting in-depth investigation and analysis of the actual situation, it is not possible to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. For example, the Hebei Daily introduced the achievements and experiences of the Tangshan Railway Factory's method-finding campaign on July 22nd of last year, but did not report on the problems existing in the factory's method-finding campaign. The newspaper did not publish the news "Tangshan Railway Factory Neglects to Promote Decisive Experience" until October 15th, which shows that the reporter did not go into depth to understand the problems in the method-finding campaign when writing the previous news, and thus made a one-sided report. The second part of the exhibits explained that because some editors, reporters, and correspondents did not work in depth, were careless, relied on hearsay, and were not realistic, they not only failed to reflect reality in a timely and accurate manner, but also made many false reports. For example, the Shanxi Daily published a reader's letter from workers Gao Wantian, Wang Ying, and others from the Taiyuan Machine Factory on May 22nd of last year, saying that Gao Wantian and others used lump coal instead of coke to bake steel furnaces, and that Gao Wantian and others' labor enthusiasm had been unprecedentedly improved after the "Three-Anti" campaign. In fact, Gao Wantian had already died at this time. The Shanxi Daily published a letter that had been suppressed for several months, not only describing the events before the "Three-Anti" campaign as events after the "Three-Anti" campaign, but also arbitrarily adding sentences about improved political awareness after the "Three-Anti" campaign. There were also many instances of using empty talk instead of concrete political education. These not only failed to achieve the purpose of deeply educating the masses, but also reduced the prestige of the Party newspaper among the masses.
    The exhibition was fruitful. In addition to the participants, some comrades from the Beijing Daily and the North China People's Liberation Army Daily also visited the exhibition. Many comrades from the Beijing Daily, after viewing the exhibition materials on "Lost Foam Casting Method," conducted a review in connection with their own work. For example, Comrade Peng Zhensui of the newspaper reviewed and said: "In the past, when going to factories, I only did general tours and did not deeply understand the problems existing in the factories and the problems that should be solved. Therefore, I could not write reports with ideological content. In the future, I will learn from Comrade Mi Rongyun's in-depth practical interview style, connect with the masses more, and reflect the problems in my work." The comrades who visited the exhibition also expressed their determination to strengthen the study of theoretical policies, further integrate theoretical policies with reality, strengthen the newspaper's guidance to practical work, and better serve the country's large-scale economic construction.
    The experience of this newspaper exhibition proves that a small-scale newspaper exhibition is a very good method for newspaper workers to conduct self-education. It can not only be held during newspaper work conferences, but also, in ordinary times, the departments in charge of newspapers of the provincial and municipal Party committees or the editorial departments of newspapers can also hold exhibitions focusing on the important problems existing in newspapers during a certain period. This is of great benefit to exchanging experience in running newspapers and improving newspaper work. However, it must be noted that before holding a newspaper exhibition, there must be clear requirements and purposes, and the content of the exhibits must be concentrated. For example, the purpose of this exhibition was to cooperate with the North China Newspaper Work Conference to solve the problem of editors and reporters delving into reality. In order to achieve this goal, the Newspaper Division of the North China Bureau not only selected materials in this regard, but also analyzed the exhibits from the perspective of delving into reality in the descriptions. This made it easier for visitors to receive a profound education. Also, because newspaper exhibitions are different from general exhibitions, the exhibits are all in written form, so it is even more necessary to be clear in terms of classification, arrangement, and written descriptions. Of course, the most important thing is how to attract more visitors in terms of content. This exhibition adopted a comparison method, comparing the titles of the same news released by Xinhua News Agency published in newspapers in various regions; comparing the news and communications with the same content released by the Shanxi Daily and the People's Daily and Xinhua News Agency. This comparison of facts gave the visitors a stronger impression. However, the good and bad typical reports exhibited this time were limited to explaining some of the problems of individual editors and reporters delving into reality; there was no systematic exhibition of the good and bad examples of one or two newspaper editorial departments delving into reality and connecting with the masses. Therefore, the expected purpose of the exhibition could not be fully achieved, which is an issue that deserves attention and improvement in the future.

    华北报纸小型展览介绍
    洪群
    中共中央华北局宣传部，在一月上旬召开华北第三次省市报纸工作会议期间，举办了小型的报纸展览会。这次展览的目的，是为了向参加会议的人提供一些参考材料，以便帮助他们更好地解决这次会议所要讨论的中心议题——报纸应如何进一步深入实际、联系群众，做好大规模经济建设的报道。
    这次展览的材料，一部分是华北局宣传部报刊时事宣传处从日常检查华北区报纸中所搜集的，一部分是由各报编辑部汇集的。全部展览材料共分两大类：第一大类是在宣传上取得一定成效的新闻、通讯、言论、宣传员讲话、通俗课本、问答、讨论、调查、座谈会、专栏、图片、漫画等。这一大类的展览品表明了：报纸应该怎样做才能深刻地反映实际、指导实际。这一大类的第一部分，是关于工、农业生产的先进经验的报道。如河北日报去年六月关于“石家庄铁路工厂翻砂工人刘喜振等创造漏模翻砂造型法成功”的报道，就完满地说明了漏模翻砂造型法的意义、作用及其操作方法，并生动地反映了先进思想与保守思想斗争的过程；这一报道对广大职工思想觉悟的提高和对生产的推动，起了很大的作用。为说明这一报道所以成功的原因，同时还展览了该报记者米荣运写的“从刘喜振漏模法的报道谈记者怎样深入实际”一文。文中介绍他采访的过程说：他感到旧的翻砂方法已不能满足机床加工的需要，如不设法改进势必影响机器工业的发展；故在发现工人刘喜振等创造的漏模翻砂造型法以后，就改变了原订的报道计划，决定突出地报道这一创造。他首先反复地向石家庄铁路工厂、修械厂以及农具厂的劳动模范、工人和技术人员请教研究，懂得了这种造型法的技术原理，即主动地向铁路工厂负责人说明这一创造的作用和意义，并在他们的支持和帮助下，动员和组织了技术人员、工人，从技术上和理论上作了总结。米荣运同志就是在这样联系群众的条件下，写出了这篇好的报道。第二部分展览品，说明报纸要反映实际、指导实际，不但要接触多方面的事物，而且还要善于透过复杂的事物现象抓住本质的问题，提出解决问题的办法。如山西日报去年十一月间发表的“‘问题篓子’中的问题是怎样解决的——记郭玉恩农业生产合作社的成长”这篇通讯，就是从叙述该社发展的过程中，生动地介绍了他们发现问题和解决问题的经验。第三部分展览品，是关于反映人民群众新思想，新生活的报道。如天津日报关于修建工人宿舍的连续报道、河北日报关于“一个农业生产合作社社员的故事”的连环画等，都显示了人民群众在共产党的领导下，正以无限的智慧和坚毅的努力，在建设自己的新生活。这些报道无疑对群众也是一个鼓舞。
    第二大类展览的材料，是一般化或有缺点有错误的报道。这些材料指明：报纸在什么地方又是由于什么原因脱离实际，而不能有力地反映实际、指导实际。这一类的第一部分展览品，说明不对实际情况进行深入调查和分析研究，就不能及时地发现问题和解决问题。如河北日报在去年七月二十二日介绍了唐山铁路工厂找窍门运动的成绩和经验，但对于该厂在找窍门运动中存在的问题却没有报道。该报迟至十月十五日才又发表了“唐山铁路工厂忽视推广决定性的经验”的消息，这说明记者在采写前一新闻时，没有去深入了解找窍门运动中的问题，因而作了片面的报道。第二部分展览品中说明由于一些编辑、记者、通讯员工作不深入、粗枝大叶、道听途说和不实事求是，不但不能及时地、准确地反映实际，反而作了不少失实的报道。如去年五月二十二日的山西日报刊登的太原机器厂工人高万田、王英等利用块炭代替焦炭烘钢炉的读者来信说，高万田等经过“三反”，劳动热忱都空前提高，实际上高万田这时早已死了。山西日报把压了几个月的来信发表，不仅把“三反”前的事说成“三反”后的事，还任意添加上“三反”后政治觉悟提高的句子。还有不少是以空话代替具体的政治教育。这些不仅达不到深刻教育群众的目的，而且降低了党报在群众中的威信。
    这次展览是有收获的。参观展览会的除参加会议者外，还有北京日报、华北解放军报的部分同志。北京日报很多同志在看了关于“漏模翻砂造型法”的展览材料后，并联系自己的工作进行了检查。如该报彭振绥同志检讨说：“过去下厂只做了一般的参观，并未深入了解工厂存在和应解决的问题，因此，就不能写出有思想内容的报道。今后要学习米荣运同志深入实际的采访作风，更多地联系群众，把工作中的问题反映出来。参观的同志并表示，决心要加强理论政策学习，进一步做到理论政策和实际的结合，以加强报纸对实际工作的指导，更好地为国家大规模经济建设服务。
    这次报纸展览的经验证明：报纸小型展览是报纸工作人员进行自我教育的一个很好的方法。它不仅可以在召开报纸工作会议时期举办，即在平时，各省、市党委管理报刊的部门或报纸编辑部，也可针对某一时期中报纸所存在的重要问题来举办。这对交流办报经验和改进报纸工作，是有很大好处的。但是必须注意，在举办报纸展览前，要有明确的要求和目的，而展览品的内容必须集中。譬如这次展览的目的就是为了配合华北报纸工作会议，解决编辑、记者深入实际的问题。为达到这个目的，华北局报刊处不仅选择了这方面的材料，同时在展览品的说明上，也从深入实际着眼进行了分析。这就易于使参观者受到深刻的教育。还因为报纸展览不同于一般展览，展览品都是文字形式，所以更需要在分类排列和文字说明等等方面，作到眉目清楚。当然，最重要的还是如何在内容上能吸引更多的参观者。这次展览，就曾采取了对比方法，把各地报纸刊登的新华社播发的同一新闻，从标题上作了对比；把山西日报和人民日报、新华社发布的同一内容的新闻，通讯做了对比。通过这种事实的对比，更给予参观者以强烈的印象。但是，这次展览出的一些好坏典型报道，还只限于说明编辑、记者个人深入实际的一些问题；没有以一、二个报纸编辑部深入实际、联系群众的好坏典型，来作系统地展览。因而在举办展览的效果上还不能完全达到预期的目的，这是值得今后注意改进的一个问题。
