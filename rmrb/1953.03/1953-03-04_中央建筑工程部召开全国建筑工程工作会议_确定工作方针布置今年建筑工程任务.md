The Central Ministry of Construction Engineering recently convened the Third National Construction Engineering Work Conference, analyzing the current basic situation of the construction sector, defining future work guidelines, and deploying this year's construction engineering tasks.

The conference first analyzed the basic situation of the construction sector: Before the "Three-Anti" campaign, there were very few state-owned and local state-owned construction enterprises, and they were very scattered. Since July of last year, from the central government to the greater administrative regions and most provinces and cities, administrative leading institutions for the construction engineering sector have been initially established, and a considerable amount of design and construction forces have been assembled (there are already over a hundred construction companies of various sizes nationwide), completing many construction tasks assigned by the state last year. However, the development of the construction sector's strength is still very disproportionate compared to the demands of the national construction tasks. Currently, the state's demands on the construction sector are: faster construction speed, greater quantity, and higher quality. The construction engineering tasks for 1953 will increase significantly compared to 1952. The current state of the construction workforce is: insufficient strength, low technical level, and impure organization, which are the main contradictions in the current work. Specifically, this is manifested in the administrative and enterprise leading institutions having few backbone personnel, lacking experience, and being unfamiliar with the business; among the technical personnel, the general problem is low technical level and lack of systematic ideological remolding; the workforce has largely not undergone the democratic reform movement, and the vast majority of construction workers have not been mobilized. In particular, impure organization is a major problem, and without solving this problem, there will be no political guarantee for the work; enterprise management, economic accounting, improving technology, and planned management will lack a good political foundation. Therefore, it is necessary to gradually solve the problems of insufficient strength and low technical level on the basis of overcoming political, ideological, and organizational impurities.

Based on the above situation, the conference determined this year's work guidelines: First, construction projects should be ranked into five categories (national defense projects, heavy industry projects, cultural and educational system projects, general financial and economic agencies, and construction projects of government bodies and organizations). Construction forces must be concentrated to first guarantee the main projects, and then appropriately take care of other projects. Second, in order to implement the above guidelines, in addition to vigorously strengthening political and ideological leadership, organizationally, the focus should be on consolidating and rectifying existing forces, and cultivating reserve forces in a planned manner.

There are three requirements for consolidating and rectifying existing forces: First, carry out supplementary democratic reform work among the employees according to the different situations in different regions. Second, carry out ideological remolding work among the technical personnel. Third, conduct necessary rectification and supplementary lessons among the office cadres. The purpose is to fully mobilize the masses of employees, raise awareness, purify the ranks, reform and establish necessary management systems, and build a pure, consolidated construction team that can master advanced technology. And on the basis of fully implementing democratic reform, cultivate activists, vigorously promote cadres, establish various responsibility systems, and implement planned management in a step-by-step manner. Democratic reform must be centered on production, must be combined with production, must be carried out under the close leadership of party committees at all levels, under the guidance of unified policies, and on the basis of fully mobilizing the worker masses, in a prepared, planned, and step-by-step manner. And from this, guide to production reform, and set off a surge of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy, and implement the economic accounting system in a planned manner, in order to truly ensure improving the quality of projects and completing production tasks on time.

There are two aspects to cultivating reserve forces: First, the general construction strength of provinces and cities should be strengthened in a planned manner. Second, at the central and greater administrative region levels, efforts should be made to cultivate senior construction forces and develop towards technical specialization. In order to achieve the above requirements, it is necessary to run various colleges, secondary technical schools, and various technical training courses in the construction system well, in order to achieve the goal of cultivating a large number of technical reserve forces. In addition, it is also necessary to pay great attention to strengthening the political theory, cultural, and business learning of incumbent cadres.

In view of the characteristics of the construction industry, which are seasonal, mobile, and decentralized, and that it is still basically manual labor, which is different from factory production, the conference especially emphasized that the construction engineering bureaus of the greater administrative regions must obey the unified leadership of the central bureaus and administrative committees, in order to prevent inappropriately emphasizing the vertical leadership of the system. And it was determined that the establishment and funding of the construction engineering bureaus of the greater administrative regions would be subject to the administrative management of the administrative committees of the greater regions, and that the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering would only maintain four unifications in its leadership over the construction engineering bureaus of the greater administrative regions, namely: unified planning, unified technical specifications, unified financial system, and unified policy implementation. The meeting unanimously agreed that under the principle of centralized and unified leadership of the central government, and being good at relying on the unified leadership of the greater administrative regions and the provincial and municipal party and government, is the key to doing a good job.

Regarding the issue of business management, it was determined that the policy of democratic management must be implemented. The formulation, implementation, and inspection of all production plans in the enterprise must be discussed, revised, and supervised by the masses. The basic requirements for business management at present are: First, strengthen the planning of production and ensure the timely completion of production tasks. Second, earnestly ensure the quality of the project, while emphasizing opposing waste and reducing costs. Third, ensure safe production. It was especially emphasized that the focus should be on ensuring the quality of the project, so as to achieve the requirements of good, fast, economical, and safe construction engineering production. The conditions for implementing planned management in the construction industry are not yet sufficient, but it is necessary to develop in this direction. This year, the greater administrative regions must focus on experimenting and exploring a relatively reliable quota, and establish various necessary systems, so as to lay the foundation for gradually implementing planned management and implementing the economic accounting system.

Several specific issues in the work were also given principled regulations: First, division of design work: It was decided to strengthen the central design institute, and in the future, high-level and difficult designs will gradually be concentrated in the central design institute, and general designs will gradually be transferred to the local design departments. Second, the supply of local materials: It is proposed to suggest to the Central Financial and Economic Committee to notify all localities to establish material supply companies with provinces and cities as units. Regarding the issue of contracting for labor and materials, four methods can be adopted: namely, contracting for all labor and materials, contracting for part of the materials, contracting only for quotas, and contracting for labor but not for materials. Third, urban construction: Due to insufficient strength in urban planning, for the time being, we can first focus on some large cities with major industrial construction for planning, and overcome the phenomenon of urban planning lagging behind production construction as soon as possible, so that basic construction can proceed smoothly. Municipal construction is recommended to be managed by a special institution set up by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Greater Administrative Region. Before a decision is made, urban construction will be a department within the organization of the Construction Engineering Bureau of the Greater Administrative Region.

At the meeting, Chen Zhengren, Minister of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering, especially proposed that we must respond to Chairman Mao's call to launch a mass movement to learn from the Soviet Union in the construction system, and systematically criticize capitalist ideology and such ideologies as conservatism and empiricism, and conduct different education for different objects, so that all personnel understand that learning all the excellent advanced experience and science and technology of the Soviet Union is the main condition for doing a good job. At the same time, the construction sector should summarize its work, rectify its organization, and vigorously carry out the anti-bureaucracy struggle, and ruthlessly expose all bureaucratic phenomena. He said: The basic link in implementing anti-bureaucracy in the construction industry is that the work of all departments must be purposefully in-depth on the construction site, and any problem must be thoroughly investigated on the construction site before a decision is made, and the opinions of the workers must be solicited. Our slogan for guiding key points is "Strengthen the construction site, go deep into the construction site."

    中央建筑工程部召开全国建筑工程工作会议
    确定工作方针布置今年建筑工程任务
    中央建筑工程部最近召开了第三次全国建筑工程工作会议，分析了建筑部门当前的基本情况，确定了今后的工作方针，并布置了今年的建筑工程任务。
    会议首先分析了建筑部门的基本情况：“三反”运动以前，国营、地方国营的建筑企业很少，很零散。去年七月以来，从中央到大区和多数省、市，都初步建立了建筑工程部门的行政领导机构，集结了相当数量的设计施工力量（全国已有大小不等的百余个建筑公司），完成了去年国家交给的许多建筑任务。但是，建筑部门力量的发展状况和国家建设任务的要求相比，还很不相称。当前国家建设对于建筑部门的要求是：建筑速度要快，数量要多，质量要高。一九五三年建筑工程任务比一九五二年增加很多。而建筑业队伍目前的状况是：力量不足，技术不高，组织不纯，这是当前工作中的主要矛盾。具体表现在行政与企业领导机构中骨干少，缺乏经验，业务生疏；在技术人员中一般的是技术不高，也未经过系统地思想改造；职工队伍大多未经过民主改革运动，绝大多数建筑工人尚未发动起来。特别是组织不纯更是一个主要问题，不解决这个问题，工作就没有政治上的保证；企业经营，经济核算，提高技术，计划管理等等，就没有良好的政治基础。因此，必须在克服政治、思想、组织各方面不纯的基础上，逐渐解决力量不足，技术不高等问题。
    根据上述情况，会议确定今年的工作方针是：一、建筑工程按五类排队（国防工程、重工业工程、文教系统工程、一般财经机关和机关团体的建筑工程），必须集中使用建筑力量首先保证主要工程，然后适当照顾其他工程。二、为了贯彻上述方针，除必须大力加强政治思想领导外，在组织上，应以整顿与巩固现有力量为主，并有计划地培养后备力量。
    整顿与巩固现有力量有三方面要求：第一、按不同地区的不同情况，在职工中进行民主改革的补课工作。第二、在技术人员中进行思想改造工作。第三、在机关干部中进行必要的整风补课。目的是要充分发动职工群众，提高觉悟，纯洁队伍，改革与建立必要的管理制度，建立一支纯洁巩固而又能掌握高度技术的建筑队伍。并在充分贯彻民主改革的基础上，培养积极分子，大力提拔干部，建立各种责任制度，做到有步骤地实行计划管理。民主改革必须以生产为中心，必须结合生产，在各级党委的密切领导下，在统一的政策指导下，在充分发动工人群众的基础上，有准备有计划有步骤地进行。并由此引导到生产改革，掀起学习苏联先进经验的热潮。开展增产节约运动，有计划地贯彻经济核算制，以确实保证提高工程质量与及时完成生产任务。
    培养后备力量有两个方面：第一、应有计划地加强省、市地方的一般建筑力量。第二、中央和大行政区一级，则应以大力培养高级建筑力量，向技术专业化方向发展。为达到上述要求，必须办好建筑系统的各种高等专门学校、中等技术学校及各种技术训练班，以达到大量培养技术后备力量的目的。此外对于加强在职干部的政治理论、文化与业务学习，也必须十分重视。
    鉴于建筑业有季节性、流动性、分散性的特点，目前又基本上还是手工作业，不同于工厂生产，故会议特别强调各大行政区建筑工程局必须服从各中央局与行政委员会的统一领导，以防止不适当地强调系统的垂直领导。并确定各大行政区建筑工程局的编制、经费。各大行政区建筑工程局行政管理属大区行政委员会，中央建筑工程部对各大行政区建筑工程局的领导只保持四项统一，即：计划的统一，技术规格的统一，财务制度的统一，政策执行上的统一。会上一致认为，在中央集中统一领导的原则下，又善于依靠大行政区及省市党政的统一领导，是做好工作的关键。
    关于经营管理问题，确定必须贯彻民主管理的方针。企业中一切生产计划的制订、推行和检查，都必须通过群众的讨论、修改并监督执行。经营管理在目前的基本要求是：第一、加强生产的计划性，保证及时完成生产任务。第二、切实保证工程质量，同时强调反对浪费、减低成本。第三、保证安全生产。特别强调要以保证工程质量为中心，达到建筑工程生产又好、又快、又省、又安全的要求。建筑业目前实行计划管理的条件还不够，但必须向这个方向发展，今年各大行政区必须重点试验摸索出一个比较可靠的定额，及建立各种必要制度，为逐渐实行计划管理与实行经济核算制打下基础。
    关于工作中的几个具体问题，也作了原则规定：一、设计分工：决定加强中央的设计院，将来高级的困难的设计，逐渐集中到中央设计院，一般设计逐渐转由地方设计部门负责。二、地方材料的供应：拟向中央财政经济委员会建议通知各地以省、市为单位设立材料供应公司。关于包工包料的问题，可采用四种办法：即工料全包、部分包料、只包定额、包工不包料。三、城市建设：城市规划因力量不足，目前可先抓紧一些大的，有工业建设的主要城市首先进行规划，从速克服城市规划落后于生产建设的现象，以使基本建设能够顺利进行。市政建设，建议由各大行政区财政经济委员会设专门机构管理，在未决定以前，城市建设为各大行政区建筑工程局机构内的一个部门。
    会上，中央建筑工程部陈正人部长特别提出必须响应毛主席号召，在建筑系统中发动一个群众性的学习苏联的高潮，并有系统地批判资本主义思想及保守主义、经验主义等思想，对不同对象进行不同的教育，务使全体人员懂得学习苏联一切优良的先进经验及科学技术是做好工作的主要条件。同时建筑部门应该通过总结工作，整顿机构，大力开展反官僚主义斗争，无情揭发一切官僚主义现象。他说：建筑业贯彻反官僚主义的基本一环，就是一切部门的工作都必须有目的地深入工地，任何问题在决定之前一定要到工地切实调查，征求工人群众意见。我们指导重点的口号是“加强工地，深入工地”。
