    A Democratic and Harmonious Family of a Volunteer Army Soldier
    Song Lin, Wang Engui, Ren Xuesong, Yang Huijun
    In the eighth district of Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, the family of Zhang Zuoguo, a soldier in the Volunteer Army, is known throughout the district as a democratic and harmonious family. Zuoguo lives in Suzigou Village. His father is sixty-six years old, and his mother is sixty-five. His daughter-in-law, Wu Fengzhi, is as capable as any young man. She participates in the mutual aid team, is skilled both inside and outside the home, and also serves as the village's health committee member, women's association member, and Party propagandist. Old man Zhang tends three acres of garden land, feeds two cows and two donkeys well, and even sold a calf he raised himself last year. The old lady feeds three pigs until they are fat and plump. One pig was slaughtered before the Spring Festival for the holiday, and another was sold for 650,000 yuan. The family's one hectare and four mu of land yielded a bumper harvest last year, producing twenty-five shi of corn (each shi being 400 jin). All three members of the family had new cotton quilts made. Life is thriving. Especially the family's harmonious spirit, which is envied by the villagers. At the district's model family of military dependents selection conference, Fengzhi's family was selected as a first-class model family of military dependents. People say, "Good things come in pairs; the Zhang family is truly outstanding."
    Speaking of Zuoguo's family, it wasn't always this good. When Zuoguo first joined the army, the family had just been emancipated not long ago, the foundation was weak, and life was still a bit difficult. With Zuoguo gone, old man Zhang and his daughter-in-law both had to go to the fields to work, and the household chores were left to the old lady. At that time, the old lady still had some old ideas and felt quite uncomfortable. She thought, "I'm getting old, and I've finally become a mother-in-law. I should be able to say whatever I want. But my daughter-in-law is always running to the fields, and she has to go out to meetings as soon as she gets home. How can this be?" There was another thing she was even more worried about: "My son has joined the army, and my daughter-in-law is always out at meetings, acting crazy. What if she wants a divorce?" Because of these wrong ideas, whenever Fengzhi returned from a meeting, the old lady would scold and argue: "Can attending meetings fill your stomach!" Sometimes, when she saw Fengzhi, she would feel displeased and mutter a few words. Fengzhi also had a bit of a temper and often argued with her mother-in-law. Old man Zhang was very anxious and couldn't think of a solution. He wanted to say a few words of advice, but he didn't know how to say them, so he could only get angry on the side. He often sighed and said, "If only Zuoguo were home! There wouldn't be these problems!" Because of the family discord, Fengzhi's work also slackened a bit.
    One day, Zuoguo's sister, Zhang Suqing, returned to her parents' home. She was a Communist Party member and intended to help her family solve their problems. She chatted with her mother for a long time, telling her about the Marriage Law, the suffering of women in the old society, and also telling her that the old ways of treating daughters-in-law were no longer acceptable. Suqing also talked with Fengzhi, gently advising her, "Mom is getting old, and she's slow to accept new things. We can't be anxious; we have to slowly explain things to the elderly."
    Suqing helped her family hold a family meeting, with old man Zhang as the chairman. At this meeting, Suqing promoted the Marriage Law and encouraged her parents and brother's wife to establish a democratic and harmonious family. She said, "Look how good our family is! My brother is fighting American devils at the front, and our family is a glorious family of military dependents. At the front, Zuoguo and his comrades are united like one person, so they can fight and win battles with a single force. There are only three people in our family, and we can't get along. People will laugh at us. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law should discuss things together. Whoever has shortcomings must overcome them. We must make our home a good place, so that Zuoguo doesn't have to worry at the front." The meeting went very well. Wu Fengzhi apologized for her bad temper. She said to her mother-in-law, "Mom, I used to be ignorant and young, and I made you angry. In the future, if there is anything I don't do well, Mom, please tell me, and I can change." The old lady's thinking also changed. She replied to her daughter-in-law, "Child, I used to have old ideas and still acted like I was in the old days. After listening to your sister, I realized that was wrong. A mother-in-law should help her daughter-in-law." The knot between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was untied, which delighted old man Zhang: "This time, our family's life will be better than ever!"
    From then on, whenever the family encountered problems, they would hold a family meeting to solve them. Last spring, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law had another argument, but that evening, the old lady proposed holding a family meeting and made a self-criticism. During a summer weeding family meeting, the family discussed and agreed on a division of labor. Old man Zhang was responsible for feeding the cattle and planting the garden; Fengzhi was responsible for the work in the fields; and the old lady was responsible for the household chores. From then on, the family no longer argued about these things. The relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law also improved. In addition to doing farm work, Fengzhi often helped her mother-in-law feed the pigs and donkeys. Once, when Fengzhi had to go to the district for a meeting, her mother-in-law encouraged her, "Child, go to the meeting without worry! You don't have to worry about the household chores." Old man Zhang also often encouraged Fengzhi to work hard.
    Old man Zhang constantly wrote letters to his son, telling him about the harmony in the family. Zhang Zuoguo was overjoyed when he received the letters. He wrote back, "You are all working so hard at home. I hope our family can become a model family." Zuoguo's letters also often reported on his life in the army. He wrote about the victories the army had won, the sports meets they had held, the comfort groups that had arrived at the front, and the gifts of comfort that the people of the motherland had sent, all of which were materials he used to encourage the family to make progress. Zuoguo had once received a banner for being a model student. He told his family that he was determined to strive to become a combat hero.
    Because of Zuoguo's encouragement and the establishment of a democratic and harmonious life, the family made progress even faster. In the past, because old man Zhang was old, the cadres in the village didn't ask him to participate in meetings. Now, he has become an active participant in various political activities in the village. Last spring, the village decided to assign him family contract farming, but they didn't accept it at first. In the end, they only accepted half of the land for contract farming. Wu Fengzhi is also very active in her work in the village. Once, in a letter to her, Zuoguo expressed his hope to receive a letter written in her own hand. This stumped her. Fengzhi had been doing well in work and labor for the past few years, but her studies were a bit lacking. Although she had entered a people's school, she had never learned well. This time, she was determined to learn culture well, work actively, and strive to join the Youth League. She participated in the village's literacy class. She told Zuoguo her determination in a letter and challenged him with the conditions of striving to become a labor model and a study model, and taking good care of her parents' health. Last October, her determination was realized. She joined the Youth League and also became the leader of the League group. The old lady was also very happy that Fengzhi joined the League. She said to old man Zhang with a smile, "Look how good our family is, Zuoguo is a Party member, and Fengzhi is a League member; only the two of us are lagging behind." However, the old couple didn't lag behind either, and the whole family became a first-class model family of military dependents in the district.
    After the New Year this year, the family held another family meeting. According to Fengzhi's proposal, they joined the agricultural production cooperative. All the family's land and livestock were invested in shares, and Fengzhi worked in the cooperative. When Zuoguo heard this news, he wrote back, "I am very happy to hear that the family has become a model family of military dependents and has also joined the production cooperative. I hope you will maintain this glorious title; you must also take the lead in working hard in the cooperative and lead the masses to advance towards socialism step by step. I will work even harder to kill the enemy in Korea to protect you and the people of the whole country to build our country well."

    一个民主和睦的志愿军军属家庭
    松林、王恩贵、任雪松、杨惠君
    在吉林省蛟河县第八区志愿军战士张佐国的家庭是全区有名的民主和睦的家庭。佐国住在苏子沟村。父亲六十六岁啦，母亲已经是六十五岁。媳妇吴凤芝顶个小伙子。她参加了互助组，内内外外都是好手，还当了村里的卫生委员、妇女会委员，又是党的宣传员。张老大爷侍弄着三亩园子地，喂好了两条牛、两只驴，头年还卖出了一条亲手喂大的小牛。老太太把三口猪喂得肥肥的。一口猪在春节前杀了过节，另一口卖了六十五万元。家里一垧四亩地，去年闹了个大丰收，打了二十五石玉米（每石四百斤）。全家三个人都做了新棉被。日子过得火红红的。特别是一家子那股和睦劲，乡亲们看了都羡慕。在全区评选军属模范大会上，凤芝家当选了一等模范军属家庭。人们说：“神仙出在一洞，佐国家真是好样的。”
    说起佐国的家庭，原先并不是这样好的。佐国刚参军的时候，家庭刚翻身不久，底子薄，日子还有些困难。佐国一走，张老大爷和儿媳妇都要下地做活，屋里的事交给了老太太。那时候，老太太还有些旧思想，心里怪不舒服的。她想：“自己一把子年纪，好容易熬成个婆婆，娶了个儿媳妇，自己该说啥就是啥。可是媳妇老是往地里跑，回家还没落脚就要出去开会，这还成个话！”还有一桩事是她更耽心的：“儿子参军去了，儿媳妇老在外面开会，疯疯癫癫的，要提出离婚怎办？”由于有这些错误想法，每逢凤芝开会回来，老太太就骂骂吵吵：“你开会能当饭吃吗！”有时候，看到凤芝就不顺心，爱嘀咕几句。凤芝也有个小性子，时常和婆婆打嘴仗。张老大爷直着急，想不出解决办法。有心劝说几句，但不知该怎么说，只好在一边生气。他常常唉声叹气地说：“要是佐国在家多好！那有这些事啊！”因为家庭不和，闹得凤芝的工作也有些松劲。
    一天，佐国的姐姐张素清回娘家了。她是个共产党员，有意来帮娘家解决家庭问题。她和妈妈唠喀了半天，跟她讲了婚姻法，讲了旧社会里妇女受压迫的苦处，还告诉她，早年头婆婆待媳妇的那一套可不行啦。素清又和凤芝谈了话，委婉地劝她：“妈年岁大了，她对新的东西接受得慢。咱们不能着急，得慢慢向老年人解释才行。”
    素清帮助娘家开了个家庭会议，由张老大爷做主席。在这个会上，素清宣传了婚姻法，鼓励爸妈和兄弟媳妇建立民主和睦的家庭。她说：“看咱家多好！我兄弟在前方打美国鬼子，咱家是光荣军属。佐国他们在前方，成千上万的同志都团结得像一个人一样，所以一股劲打胜仗。咱家只有三口人，还合不来，这叫人多笑话。婆婆和媳妇，有事要商量着办。谁有缺点，谁也得克服。咱们要把家里搞得好好的，不叫佐国在前方操心。”会开得很好，吴凤芝检讨了自己性子不够好。她对婆婆说：“妈，以前都怪我年青不懂啥，才惹得你老人家生气。以后我有个不周到处，妈你顺便告诉我，我都能改。”老太太的思想也通了。她回答媳妇说：“孩子，早头都怪我思想旧，还拿早头那个派头。这回我听你姐姐一说，那太不对了。当婆婆的应当帮助儿媳妇才对啦。”婆婆媳妇中间的疙瘩解开了，乐坏了张老大爷：“这回么，咱们家的日子有过头啦！”
    从这以后，家里遇到事情，就开个家庭会解决。去年春天，婆媳又吵了几句嘴，但当天晚上，老太太就提议开家庭会议，自己作了检讨。夏锄中间的一次家庭会议上，全家商量好了分工。张老大爷负责喂牛和种园子；凤芝负责地里的活；老太太负责家里的活。从这以后，家庭再也不为这些事吵架了。婆媳关系也好起来了。凤芝除了做地里活之外，还时常帮婆婆喂猪、喂驴。有一次，凤芝要到区上开会，婆婆鼓励她说：“孩子，你放心去开会吧！家里活你不用操心。”张老大爷也时常勉励凤芝好好工作。
    张老大爷把家里和睦的情况不断地写信告诉儿子，张佐国接了信喜欢的了不得。他回信说：“你们在家都这样地好好干，我希望咱们家庭能当上模范家庭。”佐国的回信还经常报告他在部队的生活情况。部队打了胜仗啦，开了运动会啦，慰问团到了前线啦，收到了祖国人民送的慰问品啦，都是他写信鼓励家庭进步的材料。佐国曾经得到过一面学习模范的锦旗。他告诉家里，他决心争取当战斗英雄。
    因为佐国的鼓励，因为建立了民主和睦的生活，一家人进步更快了。过去，张老大爷因为年纪大，村里开会干部们都不找他参加。现在，他成了村里各种政治活动中的积极分子。去年春天，村上决定要给他家包耕，开始他们还不接受。最后只接受了一半地的代耕。吴凤芝做村里的工作也很积极。有一次，佐国在给她的信里表示，他希望能够接到她亲笔写的一封信。这一下把她难住了。这几年来凤芝工作劳动都好，只是学习差一点，虽然进了民校，可是一直没学好。这次，她下定决心学好文化，积极工作，争取入团。她参加了村里的速成识字班学习。她把自己的决心回信告诉了佐国，并且提出以争取当劳动模范、学习模范，照顾好父母身体等为条件，向佐国挑战。去年十月，她的决心实现了，她参加了青年团，又当了团的小组长。凤芝入了团，老太太也挺高兴的。她笑着对张老大爷说：“你看咱家多好，佐国是党员，凤芝是团员；就是咱老俩口子落后了。”但是，老俩口子也没落后，一家子成了全区的一等模范军属家庭。
    今年过年以后，全家又开了家庭会议，根据凤芝的提议，参加了农业生产合作社。把全家土地牲口都入了股，凤芝在合作社劳动。佐国知道了这些消息，写回来信说：“听到家里当了模范军属，又参加了生产合作社，我真高兴极了。希望你们保持这个光荣称号；还要带头在合作社好好工作，带动群众，一步一步往社会主义前进。我在朝鲜一定更加努力杀敌，保卫你们和全国人民好好建设咱们的国家。”
