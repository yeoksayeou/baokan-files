    Zedongbal Writes Article in Memory of Stalin
    "People's Daily" published an article by Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, General Secretary of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, entitled: "J.V. Stalin – Great Friend of the Mongolian People." The article stated:

    The most beautiful and happiest developments in the life of the Mongolian people are inseparable from the name of the Soviet Union and the great Stalin.
    Stalin, together with Lenin, illuminated the Mongolian grasslands with the immortal light of the October Revolution, liberated our people from the heavy shackles of colonialism and social oppression, helped them gain happiness and freedom, and provided them with friendly assistance in building their new lives.

    Tsedenbal emphasized: The freedom and independence of the Mongolian people have been seriously threatened more than once by imperialist aggressors and their accomplices. Whenever there was a moment of urgency, our great friend and mentor, Comrade Stalin, came to our aid, using his firm hand to remove the danger that threatened us, and helped our people consolidate their hard-won freedom and independence.

    Tsedenbal continued: Comrade Stalin was the organizer and inspirer of the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Mongolian peoples. He and the immortal Lenin established this friendship. It is only because of Lenin and Stalin's friendship with our people, because of the fraternal and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and the constant fatherly care of the great Stalin, that the Mongolian people have been able to achieve great victories in overcoming long-term backwardness, in developing our economy and culture, in establishing and developing national industry, in developing education and public health, and in improving the material and cultural standards of the people.

    Tsedenbal concluded by writing: The Mongolian people will protect and consolidate their great Stalinist friendship with the Soviet people – the source of their happiness and prosperity – as they would protect their own eyes.
