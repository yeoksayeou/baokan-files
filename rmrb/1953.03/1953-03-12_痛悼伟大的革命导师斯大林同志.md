    Deeply Mourning the Great Revolutionary Teacher Comrade Stalin
    Fu Lianzhang, Chairman of the Chinese Medical Association
    Comrade Stalin has passed away. Thousands of words cannot express our grief.
    On March 5th, when the news of Comrade Stalin's serious illness reached us, the General Association of the Chinese Medical Association immediately convened medical experts in Beijing for a discussion. Everyone sincerely expressed their infinite concern for Comrade Stalin's health. Anxiously hoping that Comrade Stalin's serious illness would improve, everyone offered treatment suggestions. On the evening of that day and the following morning, medical workers from all over the country also sent telegrams, offering many treatment suggestions. Although, in the end, this greatest misfortune encountered by the working people of the world proved to be beyond the reach of current medical science to save, the enthusiasm of our medical workers fully demonstrated the infinite love of the Chinese people for Comrade Stalin.
    Every Chinese person, upon hearing the sad news of Comrade Stalin's death, will, in addition to grief, recall the great Comrade Stalin and the Soviet people's generous and selfless assistance to our country. We medical workers have the same memories. Speaking only from the perspective of health work, during our country's War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Stalin sent outstanding Soviet medical experts to our country. These experts worked with our medical workers in the most difficult environments. Soviet medical experts helped us cure countless sick and wounded comrades and helped us train many medical cadres. The victory on our health front during the War of Resistance Against Japan, just like the entire victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, was inseparable from Comrade Stalin's concern. After the nationwide liberation of our country, Comrade Stalin sent even more outstanding experts to help our country carry out construction work. Soviet medical experts helped our country overcome severe infectious diseases such as plague, helped us improve health and epidemic prevention measures, helped us improve medical education, helped us cure countless patients, and brought us new medical theories, medical technologies, and medical work styles. The great progress in our people's health undertakings since the nationwide liberation of our country, just like the entire great progress of our country's construction undertakings, is also inseparable from Comrade Stalin's concern for our country's peaceful construction and for the health of our people.
    Every Chinese person, upon hearing the sad news of Comrade Stalin's death, will, in addition to grief, feel that they should exert even greater efforts to do their jobs even better for the cause of defending world peace and for the cause of national construction. We medical workers also hold such a will. We must make redoubled efforts to ensure the continuous victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. We must make redoubled efforts to ensure the continuous victory against the bacteriological warfare of U.S. imperialism. We must make redoubled efforts to ensure the continuous victory of the patriotic health movement. We must make redoubled efforts to guarantee the continuous victory of our country's economic, cultural, and national defense construction with our health and medical work.
    The great friendship between our country and the Soviet Union is constantly growing. Learning from the great Soviet Union is our unwavering direction. The close cooperation between our medical workers and Soviet medical workers, and the medical science exchanges between our medical circles and Soviet medical circles, will continue to be strengthened and will never end.
    At this moment, we feel even more strongly the solemn and great responsibility that our medical workers bear in the struggle against disease and in increasing human lifespan. To further strive to improve the level of medical science under the guidance of Soviet medical thought is our unremitting task.
    Chairman Mao said in his telegram of condolence for Comrade Stalin: "The Chinese people will, with the greatest determination, always unite closely with the great Soviet people, consolidate and strengthen the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, heighten vigilance, redouble our efforts, strike at the instigators of war, and fight to the end for the permanent interests of the Soviet and Chinese people and for world peace and security. I believe that all working people and peace-loving progressive humanity throughout the world will, along with us, follow the direction indicated by Comrade Stalin and shoulder the sacred cause of defending world peace." All medical workers in China, let us turn grief into strength, cheer up, follow the direction indicated by Comrade Stalin, and move forward unswervingly. Any conspiracy of the enemy will be completely crushed by us.

    痛悼伟大的革命导师斯大林同志
    中国医学会主席　傅连暲
    斯大林同志逝世了。千言万语写不出我们的悲痛。
    三月五日那天，当斯大林同志病重的消息传来之后，我们中华医学会总会曾一刻也不能等待地召集了北京市的医学专家们进行座谈。大家衷心地陈述着对于斯大林同志健康状况的无限关怀。在焦急地盼望着斯大林同志的重病能以好转的心情支配之下，大家曾纷纷提出治疗意见。当天晚上和次日清晨，各地医务工作者也纷纷来电，提出许多治疗意见。虽然，最后证明我们全世界劳动人民所遭遇到的这个最大的不幸，终非目前水平的医学科学所能挽救，但是我国医务工作者的这种热忱，完全说明了我国人民对于斯大林同志的无限爱戴。
    每个中国人民听到斯大林同志病逝的噩耗之后，在悲痛之余，都会回忆起伟大的斯大林同志和苏联人民对于我国的慷慨无私的援助。我们医务工作者，同样引起这样的回忆。仅从卫生工作方面说，在我国抗日战争时期，斯大林同志曾派遣苏联的优秀医学专家来到我国，这些专家在最艰苦的环境里和我国医务工作者一起工作。苏联医学专家帮助我们治愈了无数的伤病同志，帮助我们培养了许多医务干部。在抗日战争期间我们卫生战线上的胜利正和抗日战争的整个胜利一样，是与斯大林同志的关怀完全分不开的。我国全国解放以后，斯大林同志又派遣了更多的优秀专家帮助我国进行建设工作。苏联医学专家曾帮助我国战胜了像鼠疫这样的烈性传染病，帮助我们改进了卫生防疫措施，帮助我们改进了医学教育，帮助我们治愈了无数的病人，给我们带来了新的医学理论、医疗技术和医疗作风。我国自全国解放以来在人民卫生事业上的长足发展，正和我国建设事业的整个长足发展一样，也是与斯大林同志对我国和平建设的关怀、对我国人民健康的关怀完全分不开的。
    每个中国人民听到斯大林同志病逝的噩耗之后，在悲痛之余，都会感到应该拿出更大的力量，为了保卫世界和平的事业，为了国家建设事业，更加做好自己所担当的工作。我们医务工作者同样怀抱着这样的意志。我们一定要以加倍的努力保证抗美援朝的不断胜利。我们一定要以加倍的努力，保证反对美国帝国主义细菌战的不断胜利。我们一定要以加倍的努力，保证爱国卫生运动的不断胜利。我们一定要以加倍的努力，以我们的卫生医疗工作，保证我国经济、文化和国防建设的不断胜利。
    我国与苏联的伟大友谊是永远在增进之中的。向伟大的苏联学习，是我们始终不移的方向。我国医务工作者与苏联医务工作者的亲密合作，我国医学界与苏联医学界的医学科学交流，将继续加强，永无止境。
    此时，我们愈加感到我们医务工作者在与疾病斗争上，在增长人类寿命上所负责任的庄严重大。在苏联医学思想指导之下，更加努力地提高医学科学水平，是我们的不可放松的任务。
    毛主席在吊唁斯大林同志的电文中说：“中国人民一定会以最大的坚定性，和伟大的苏联人民永远紧密地团结一致，巩固并加强以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，提高警惕，加倍努力，打击战争挑拨者，为苏中两国人民的永久利益和世界和平与安全而奋斗到底。我相信，全世界一切劳动人民和爱好和平的进步人类，都将和我们一道，遵循斯大林同志指示的方向，把保卫世界和平的神圣事业担当起来。”全中国的医务工作者们，让我们把悲痛化为力量，更加振作起来，遵循着斯大林同志所指示的方向，坚定不移地前进吧。敌人的任何阴谋诡计都是要被我们彻底粉碎的。
