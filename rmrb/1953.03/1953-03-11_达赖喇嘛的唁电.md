To the Funeral Committee for Comrade Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union:

    Upon learning the unfortunate news of the passing of Chairman Stalin, the great leader of progressive people throughout the world, officials, monks, and people of Tibet feel deeply grieved. To mourn Chairman Stalin, the leader of our great ally, in accordance with Tibetan ethnic and religious customs, on March 9th, I led over 20,000 monks in a grand prayer meeting at the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, and distributed alms to monks and offered thousands of lamps in major temples for blessings in order to express our condolences. Hereafter, all monks and laypeople of Tibet, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government, and on the basis of the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union, will further strengthen unity among all ethnic groups in the country, and strive to defend the motherland, defend Asia, and defend world peace.
                      Dalai Lama of the Local Government of Tibet, China
                                March 9, 1953
