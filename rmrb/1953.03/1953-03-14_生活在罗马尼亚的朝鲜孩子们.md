    The Lives of Korean Children in Romania
    Romania　Tuotesigu

    Târgoviște, northwest of Bucharest, is a quiet scenic area in Romania. Around it are many tree-covered hills. Last summer, the Romanian government specially built a tall building on a hilltop near Târgoviște to accommodate hundreds of children from Korea. Now, five hundred children, aged nine to sixteen, who have lost their parents, are living quietly and happily in this peaceful environment.

    One sunny morning, we visited the Korean children's residence. As we walked in, the children were having breakfast in the dining hall. If you didn't hear the Romanian staff speaking, you would think you were in a school in Korea. Here, everywhere you look, you can see slogans and wall newspapers written in Korean. Pictures of General Kim Il-sung and paintings depicting the struggle of the Korean people are hung everywhere. Everything here shows the children's longing and love for their homeland thousands of miles away. The building has one hundred and fifty-eight bedrooms, each spacious and bright, housing five or six children. The heating system keeps the room at a comfortable temperature in winter. Each bedroom has curtains and bedspreads of different colors. Toys, notebooks, neatly arranged books, and pictures on the walls add to the comfortable and peaceful atmosphere of the room. Everywhere you can feel that someone is thoughtfully arranging a comfortable life for the children, making them feel as if they were at home.

    By April this year, another building will be completed, which will house a performance hall, a library, a gymnasium, and a club. Various flowers and plants will be planted around the building, and a stadium will also be built nearby.

    Comrade Park Young-sun, the Korean administrator who came with the children, warmly received us. When he talked about the children, his eyes showed a tender and excited light. He said, "Our children feel that they are living very well here. They have received the care and love of the Romanian people. Now they are healthy, strong, and they study very hard. We are very grateful for the help of the Romanian government and people. Their care, like parents treating their own children, has greatly helped us Korean teachers."

    Then, Park Young-sun talked about the children's studies: "Now we have all the convenient conditions to allow the children to study with peace of mind. They are learning Korean history, literature, and the geography of their homeland. Our curriculum here is the same as that of schools in Korea. We educate the children according to Korean traditions and customs. Our goal is to make the children useful people who will return to rebuild their homeland in the future."

    Speaking of this, we went to visit the dining hall. As we walked into the dining hall, the sound of knives, forks, cups, plates, and the children's laughter immediately entered our ears. Each table was filled with food: butter, jam, rice, bread, vegetable soup, milk... The children were drinking milk from white porcelain cups. One girl had finished her cup of milk and wanted another cup, so she held out her cup to one of the Romanian nannies in white and said:

    "Amani! I want a little more!"

    The nanny immediately poured her a cup and then turned to us and said:

      "They all call us mom..." Her tone was so kind that one could feel her joy and pride. Indeed, the children whose mothers were killed by the American devils have found hundreds and thousands of equally loving and kind mothers in the fraternal country of Romania.

    After breakfast, the Young Pioneer on duty blew the bugle, and the boys and girls, with their books and stationery, went to the classroom to attend class. ……

    We visited the eighth-grade classroom, where a Korean literature class was in progress. The teacher, Kim Soon-hyung, was reading aloud a student's composition, which described the peaceful life of the Korean people before the war and the struggle against the American aggressors after the outbreak of the war.

    "Korea is fighting... The Korean people will surely win!..." the teacher said at the end.

    In other classrooms, some students were reciting poems, some were listening attentively to the teacher explaining the course on Korean agriculture and animal husbandry, and some were learning arithmetic, music, national geography, and Romanian. Every student was concentrating on studying hard. When you asked them, the answers were all the same and affirmative: "We must study hard so that we can go back and rebuild our homeland in the future!"

    After lunch, the children had a rest time, and they all came to the open space in front of the house to rest and play. Some climbed mountains, some sang, and some were enthusiastically learning to ski. In the afternoon, they had two more hours of study, followed by the Young Pioneer activities. The children decorated their Young Pioneer room very exquisitely, with the national flag and the Young Pioneer flag hanging on the wall, as well as neat wall newspapers. Many people here painted, wrote slogans, or did other activities.

    At ten o'clock in the evening, the Young Pioneer on duty blew the bugle for rest, and the children ended their day's activities.

    In the northern part of Moldavia, more than 100 kilometers away from Târgoviște, there are another thousand Korean children aged four to eleven, who all live in a children's camp called Siret. This children's camp, composed of forty-seven temporary houses, has become a real paradise for the children.

    "Mama! Cervia Mama!" When we visited this Korean children's camp, a series of crisp voices came from inside, and they were greeting their administrator.

    Cervia told us about the situation of receiving and arranging the children's lives. She said:

    "When these children first arrived here, our first concern was their health. Experienced pediatricians were immediately sent here to take care of the sick children. We paid special attention to their nutrition, and now they are so healthy that they are unrecognizable. Every child has gained five to eight kilograms in weight."

    So, Cervia took us to visit. Here, there is a teacher for every twenty-five children, and there are two nannies in each house to take care of the children's food, clothing, and daily life. They take care of the children carefully, and some are also working hard to learn Korean in order to better understand the children's needs.

    In the beginning, the main task here was to eliminate the trauma that the children had suffered in their hearts, to help them recover from the impressions of war and bloodshed, and to get rid of the shadow of terror caused by the crimes of the American executioners.

    Cervia told us: "Children often wake up from their dreams crying. Only after the nannies and teachers patiently explain and comfort them will they return to peace. Indeed, it is difficult to make the children forget the war. In their young minds, the seeds of hatred for the American imperialist aggression have been buried, and they will never forget the crimes of the American murderers."

    We visited a classroom where the teacher was telling the children the story of a Korean patriot. Many children here were wearing red scarves, and they were listening excitedly, so much so that they did not notice our arrival.

    The children here are very small, some are not even as tall as the table, so they especially need to be taken care of. Many children are helped by nannies when they eat. After lunch, each child has to take a two-hour nap.

    When we said goodbye to the administrators and teachers and came out, it was almost dusk. At this time, the children were practicing singing and dancing in their club. Even after we left the children's camp hundreds of steps away, we could still faintly hear the children's singing from behind. These two visits, the smiling faces of these children who are far away from their homeland and are well taken care of by the Romanian people, and their happy and joyful lives, left a deep impression on us, and made us more convinced that the Korean people's struggle against imperialist aggression is the common cause of the peace-loving people of the world, and that with the support of the entire peace and democracy camp, they will surely achieve the final victory!

    生活在罗马尼亚的朝鲜孩子们
    罗马尼亚　托特斯古
    布加勒斯特西北部的泰戈维果城是罗马尼亚的一个幽静的风景区。在它的四周，环绕着许多长满树木的小山。去年夏天，在泰戈维果城附近的一个山头上，罗马尼亚政府特地兴建起了一座高大的建筑物，来接待来自朝鲜的数百名儿童。现在，五百名失去了父母的九岁到十六岁的孩子们，在这个和平的环境里过着安静愉快的生活。
    一个天气晴朗的早上，我们去访问了朝鲜儿童们的住所。当我们走进去的时候，孩子们正在餐厅里用早餐。如果没有听到罗马尼亚工作人员说话的声音，人们准会以为自己处身在朝鲜的一个学校里。在这里，每一处地方，人们都可以看到用朝鲜文写的标语和墙报。到处都张挂着金日成将军的像片和表现朝鲜人民斗争的画幅。这里的每一件东西，都表示着孩子们对于远在千里之外的祖国的怀念和敬爱。这座楼房有着一百五十八个寝室，每一间宽敞明亮的寝室里住五、六个孩子。暖气设备在冬天使室内经常地保持着适当的温度。每一间寝室内的窗幔和铺覆在床上的床单，都有着不同的花色。摆设在小桌上的玩具，复写簿，整齐的书本，墙上的图画，使房间增添了舒适恬静的气氛。在每一处地方，人们都会感觉得出来，有人在体贴入微地为孩子们安排舒适的生活，让他们感到和在自己的家里一样。
    到今年四月间，另一座楼房又要完成了，那里将设有一个表演厅，一个图书馆，健身房和俱乐部。这座楼房的周围将要栽种各种花卉植物，并且还要在附近建立一个体育场。
    和孩子们一起来的朝鲜管理员朴英先同志热烈地接待我们。当他和我们谈起这些孩子们的时候，他的两眼露出了温存的兴奋的光芒，他说：“我们的孩子感到在这里生活得很好。他们受到了罗马尼亚人民的照顾和热爱。现在他们是健康的、强壮的，他们很努力学习。我们十分感谢罗马尼亚政府和人民的帮助，他们这种像双亲对待自己儿女一样的关怀，极大地帮助了我们这些朝鲜教员们。”
    接着，朴英先谈到了孩子们的学习情况：“现在我们有一切便利的条件来使孩子们安心地学习。他们学习着朝鲜的历史、文学和祖国的地理。我们这里的课程和国内学校的课程是一样的。我们按照朝鲜的传统和习惯来教育孩子们。我们的目的就是使孩子成为有用的人，将来好回去建设祖国。”
    谈到这里，我们就前往餐厅去参观。当我们走进餐厅的时候，刀、叉、杯、盘的声音和孩子们的欢笑声立刻传入了人们的耳朵。每一张餐桌上都放满了食物：黄油、果酱、米饭、面包、菜汤、牛奶……。孩子们正在喝着盛在白色磁杯里的牛奶。一个女孩已喝完了杯里的牛奶，还想要一杯，于是她就向照顾她们的一个穿着白色衣服的罗马尼亚保姆伸出杯子说：
    “阿妈妮！我还要喝一点！”
    这位保姆立刻舀了一杯给她，然后转过身来对我们说：
      “她们全把我们叫作妈妈……”她的声调是那么地亲切，令人体会到她的喜悦和骄傲。的确，被美国鬼子杀害了母亲的孩子们，在兄弟的国家罗马尼亚找到了成千成百个同样慈爱亲切的妈妈。
    早餐过后，值日的少先队员就吹起了号角，于是男孩女孩们都带着书本、文具，走进教室去上课。…………
    我们参观了第八级的教室，那里正在上朝鲜文学课。教员金顺亨正在向大家朗读一个学生的作文，这篇作文描写了朝鲜人民在战前的和平生活，和战争爆发以后反抗美国侵略者的斗争。
    “朝鲜在战斗中……朝鲜人民一定会胜利！……”教员在结尾的时候这样说。
    在别的教室里，有的学生在朗诵诗歌，有的在静听教员讲解关于朝鲜的农业与家畜的课程，有的在学算术、音乐、本国地理与罗马尼亚文，每一个学生都在专心地努力学习着。当你问到他们的时候，答复都是同样肯定的：“我们一定努力学习，以便将来回去重建我们的祖国！”
    午餐以后，孩子们有一个休息时间，他们都到屋前的空地上来休息玩乐，有的爬山，有的唱歌，有的还在兴致勃勃地学滑雪。下午，他们还有两小时的学习，然后是少先队的活动时间。孩子们把自己的少先队室布置得十分精致，墙上挂着祖国的国旗和少先队的旗帜，还有整齐的墙报。许多人在这里画画、写标语，或者作别的活动。
    晚上十点，值日的少先队员吹起了休息的号角，于是孩子们就结束了自己一天的活动。

    在距离泰戈维果城一百多公里的莫尔达维亚北部地方，还有另外一千名年龄在四岁到十一岁的朝鲜儿童，他们都住在一个名叫西莱特的儿童营里。这个儿童营由四十七所临时搭盖起来的房屋所组成，它已经成了孩子们的真正的乐园了。
    “妈妈！雪尔维亚妈妈！”当我们去访问这个朝鲜儿童营的时候，从里面传来了孩子们一连串的清脆的声音，他们正在招呼自己的管理员。
    雪尔维亚对我们讲述了她们接待与安排孩子们生活的情形。她说：
    “当这些孩子们初到这里的时候，我们首先注意的是他们的健康情形。有经验的小儿科医生马上被派来这里照顾有病的孩子。我们特别注意他们的营养，现在他们都已健壮得认不出来了，每个孩子的体重都增加了五公斤到八公斤。”
    于是，雪尔维亚就带我们去参观。这里每二十五个孩子就有一个教员，每一所屋子里都有两个照顾孩子们饮食起居的保姆，她们都细心地照管着孩子，有的还在下功夫学朝鲜语，以便更好地了解孩子们的要求。
    在开始时，这里主要的工作是消除孩子们在心灵上所受到的创伤，让他们从战争与流血的印象中恢复过来，摆脱掉由美国刽子手的罪行所造成的恐怖阴影。
    雪尔维亚对我们说：“孩子们常常会从睡梦中惊醒哭喊过来。只有当保姆和教员们给他们耐心地解释，安慰了他们以后，才会恢复安静。的确，要使孩子们忘掉战争是困难的。在他们幼小的心灵上，已经埋下了仇恨美帝国主义侵略的种子，他们是一辈子也不会忘记美国杀人犯的罪行的。”
    我们参观了一个教室，教员正在向孩子们讲一个朝鲜爱国者的故事，这里的许多孩子都围着红领巾，他们都在激动地听着，以至没有注意到我们的到来。
    这里的孩子都很小，有的身材还够不上桌子那么高，所以特别需要别人照顾，很多孩子在吃饭时都是由保姆帮着吃的。在午餐以后，每个孩子都要睡两小时的午觉。
    当我们向管理员和教员们告别出来的时候，已经将近黄昏了。这时孩子们正在自己的俱乐部里练习歌唱舞蹈，当我们离开这个儿童营几百步远以后，还隐约地听见从身后传来的孩子们的歌声。这两次的访问，这些远离祖国受着罗马尼亚人民妥善照顾的孩子们的笑脸，和他们的愉快幸福的生活，给我们留下了深刻的印象，并使我们更加确信：朝鲜人民反对帝国主义侵略的斗争是世界爱好和平人民的共同事业，在整个和平民主阵营的支持之下，他们一定会取得最后的胜利！（附图片）
