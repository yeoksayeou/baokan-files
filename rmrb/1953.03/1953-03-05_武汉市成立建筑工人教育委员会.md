    Wuhan City has established a Construction Workers Education Committee. The chairman of the Education Committee is concurrently held by Zeng Dun, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the vice-chairman is concurrently held by Su Xing, Vice Chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. The tasks of the Education Committee mainly involve conducting political and technical education for construction workers. In the first half of this year, the focus will be on strengthening workers' political and ideological education, enhancing their class consciousness, inspiring their class awareness, establishing a sense of responsibility as masters of the country, and enabling them to recognize the future. The Education Committee will also conduct technical education in conjunction with the production movement, based on raising the political awareness of construction workers.
    Currently, relevant units in the Central South Region, Hubei Province, and Wuhan City have dispatched cadres to be responsible for leading and specifically carrying out organizational work, drafting education plans. It is expected that around early March, the education work for workers will be gradually launched at various construction sites.

    武汉市成立建筑工人教育委员会
    武汉市成立了建筑工人教育委员会。教育委员会主任委员由中共武汉市委员会宣传部曾惇副部长兼任，副主任委员由武汉市总工会苏星副主席兼任。教育委员会的任务，主要是对建筑工人进行政治教育和技术教育。在今年上半年，他们将以加强工人的政治思想教育，提高工人的阶级觉悟为主，以启发工人的阶级觉悟，树立主人翁的劳动态度和使他们认清前途。教育委员会并将在提高建筑工人的政治觉悟的基础上，结合生产运动进行技术教育。
    现在，中南区、湖北省、武汉市各有关单位已抽调干部负责领导和具体的进行组织工作，草拟教育计划，预计在三月上旬左右，将在各建筑工地逐步展开工人的教育工作。
