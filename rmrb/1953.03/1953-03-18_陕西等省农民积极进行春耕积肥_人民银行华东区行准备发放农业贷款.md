Xinhua News Agency report: Farmers in Shaanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Zhejiang, Shandong, and other provinces are actively engaged in spring plowing and fertilizer accumulation.

    In the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, farmers are busily hoeing wheat and plowing land; in Baoji, Weinan, and other counties, 40 percent of the wheat fields have been hoed, and 30 percent of the cotton fields have been plowed twice. In Nanzheng, Chenggu, and other counties in the Han River basin, wheat seedlings are already five or six inches tall, and rapeseed is in full bloom; most farmers are busy with spring irrigation and rice seedling cultivation. Mountainous farmers in the Ankang and Shangluo Special Districts have also begun transporting manure up the mountains and plowing the land to prepare for spring sowing. Farmers in northern Shaanxi are sowing spring wheat.

    Due to the early arrival of warm weather this year, some wheat fields in Sanyuan, Jingyang, Hua County, Liquan, and other counties in Shaanxi Province have suffered from red spider mites and wheat aphids. Local governments are leading farmers to actively prevent and control these pests.

    In order to closely integrate the Marriage Law propaganda and implementation campaign with spring plowing and production work, party and government leading organs at all levels above the county level in Shaanxi Province have transferred a large number of cadres to go to the countryside before March 5 to supervise and inspect. The Shaanxi Provincial Drought Resistance and Prevention Committee has also instructed all localities to strengthen leadership over spring plowing and production, reverse the slackening and paralysis of farmers' thinking on drought resistance and prevention, and further mobilize the masses of farmers to make full use of all water sources, focusing on carrying out water storage activities. Currently, the five small-scale water conservancy work teams and sixty well-drilling teams newly established by the Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau have been dispatched to various locations to work.

    Farmers in most areas of Sichuan Province have prepared the fertilizer needed for this year's spring sowing. Last winter, farmers in various localities launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign. In some areas, the fertilizer accumulation campaign was combined with the patriotic health campaign. The Chen Xianfu mutual aid team in Xinmin Township, Kaijiang County, Sichuan Province, dug out the manure and grass accumulated in the cattle pens for many years, as well as the dregs and fertile mud in front of and behind the houses, accumulating more than 60,000 jin of fertilizer in three days. Chen Dengqian, a farmer in Village Eight, Taihe Township, cleaned his house thoroughly and said excitedly, "We have not only paid attention to hygiene, but also accumulated fertilizer." Through this campaign, Kaijiang County accumulated a total of more than 264 million jin of various fertilizers. Some areas combined wheat appraisal to carry out fertilizer accumulation campaigns. When mobilizing farmers to accumulate fertilizer in Zhongchi Village, Luolong Township, Nanxi County, Sichuan Province, the authorities first conducted a wheat appraisal in the fields, using examples of how the wheat seedlings grew better due to the amount of fertilizer applied to educate everyone, and then put forward the slogan "Every family raises pigs, every household accumulates fertilizer" to carry out the fertilizer accumulation campaign. The farmers in the whole village responded enthusiastically, building thirteen new pigsties and adding twenty-five pigs. Some areas combined the winter rice borer control campaign with the fertilizer accumulation campaign. Farmers in Shunjiang Village, Dongyue Township, Qionglai County, Sichuan Province, trimmed all the field ridges in the village into "three smooth surfaces," scraping off more than 110,000 jin of turf.

    In the pest elimination and fertilizer accumulation campaign in Beihu Township, Yuxi County, Yunnan Province, farmers pulled out rice roots from 350,000 mu of fields and captured more than 52,000 pests in five days. In Guishan District, Lunan County, Yunnan Province, more than 3,000 toilets were dug, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated was twice as much as last year. In Zhaojue County, Xikang Province, one district accumulated more than one million jin of fertilizer in one month.

    Farmers in Bujiapeng Township, Shouchang County, Zhejiang Province, are actively preparing for spring plowing, and some have already started spring plowing.

    Before the start of spring plowing, farmers throughout the township, with mutual aid teams as the core, conducted inspections of spring plowing preparations between households and between teams. After the inspection, villages and mutual aid teams in Bujiapeng Township held various meetings overnight to discuss how to complete the spring plowing preparations. Under the leadership of township and village cadres, many mutual aid teams formulated spring production plans or annual production plans. Farmers throughout the township studied methods such as mutual borrowing and adjustment within and between mutual aid teams, as well as renting and purchasing from other townships, to solve the problems of lacking farm tools, seeds, and draft cattle. In the ten days or so after the meeting, many farmers in Bujiapeng Township got up before dawn to go to the fields to weed and fertilize, or went to the city in groups to carry manure and went up the mountains to chop firewood and burn charcoal. Currently, the whole township has purchased more than 1,000 jin of cake fertilizer, raised eighteen more piglets, and accumulated more than 1,700 dan of burnt mud ash; a few farmers have begun to plow winter fallow fields.

    The Spring Rural Work Inspection Team organized by the Shandong Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Shandong Provincial People's Government has been dispatched to various locations since the 14th to work. The inspection team includes many senior cadres led by Wang Zhuoru, Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, along with other cadres, totaling more than 110 people, divided into fourteen groups.

    Currently, spring plowing has started comprehensively in the southern regions of Shandong Province. More than half of the farm households in the province have formulated patriotic bumper harvest plans. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various localities are supplying a large amount of fertilizer, farm tools, and other means of production to farmers. After the inspection team goes to the countryside, it will comprehensively promote spring plowing production and the patriotic bumper harvest competition campaign in Shandong Province.

    In order to cooperate with farmers' spring sowing, the People's Bank of China East China Branch is now actively preparing to issue agricultural loans. The total amount of agricultural loans in the East China region in 1953 increased by 1.46 times compared with last year. This year's loans are mainly used to help farmers build water conservancy projects, increase fertilizer application, promote new farm tools, prevent and control diseases and pests, and breed superior livestock; at the same time, they support local grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, invigorate the primary market, and help farmers sell agricultural and sideline products to promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

    陕西等省农民积极进行春耕积肥
    人民银行华东区行准备发放农业贷款
    据新华社讯：陕西、四川、云南、浙江、山东等省农民积极进行春耕积肥。
    陕西省关中地区，农民正紧张锄麦、犁地；宝鸡、渭南等县麦田已锄完百分之四十，棉田有百分之三十已犁过两遍。汉江流域的南郑、城固等县，麦苗已有五、六寸高，菜籽开花正盛；一般农民正忙着春灌和育秧工作。安康专区和商雒专区的山区农民，也开始上山送粪、犁地，准备春播。陕北地区农民正在播种春小麦。
    由于今年春暖过早，陕西省三原、泾阳、华县、醴泉等县部分麦田发生红蜘蛛和麦蚜等虫害，当地人民政府正领导农民积极防治。
    为了使宣传贯彻婚姻法的运动紧密结合春耕生产工作，陕西省县以上各级党、政领导机关都抽调大批干部，在三月五日前下乡督促检查。陕西省抗旱防旱委员会并指示各地加强对春耕生产的领导，扭转农民群众对抗旱防旱的松劲麻痹思想，进一步发动农民群众充分利用一切水源，重点开展蓄水运动。现在，陕西省人民政府水利局增设的五个小型水利工作队和六十个凿井小组，已分赴各地工作。
    四川省大部地区农民已准备了今年春耕播种需用的肥料，去年冬天，各地农民就展开积肥运动。有些地区的积肥运动是与爱国卫生运动相结合的。四川省开江县新民乡陈先福互助组，把多年堆积在牛圈里的粪草和屋前屋后的渣滓、肥泥都挖了出来，三天内就积了六万多斤肥料；太和乡八村农民陈登前把房子打扫得干干净净，兴奋地说：“既讲了卫生，又积了肥料。”经过这次运动，开江县全县共积各种肥料二亿六千四百多万斤。有些地区结合小麦评比来开展积肥运动。四川省南溪县罗龙乡中池村动员农民积肥时，首先进行田间小麦评比，把因施肥多少而麦苗长得好坏的实例教育大家，然后提出“家家喂猪、户户积肥”的口号，开展积肥运动，全村农民热烈响应，新修了十三个猪圈，添喂了二十五只猪。有些地区的积肥运动结合了冬季治螟运动。四川省邛崃县东岳乡顺江村农民，把全村所有的田坎铲成“三面光”，铲得草皮十一万多斤。
    云南省玉溪县杯湖乡农民在除虫积肥运动中，五天内拔了三十五万亩田的稻根，捉了五万二千多条害虫。云南省路南县圭山区挖厕所三千多个，积肥数量比去年多两倍；西康省昭觉县的一个区在一个月中积肥一百万斤以上。
    浙江省寿昌县卜家蓬乡农民正在积极准备春耕，有的已经开始春耕。
    在春耕开始前，全乡农民以互助组为核心，对春耕准备工作，进行了户与户、组与组的检查。检查完毕后，卜家蓬乡各村、各互助组连夜召开各种会议，讨论如何完成春耕准备工作。很多互助组在乡、村干部的领导下，订出了春季生产计划或全年生产计划。全乡农民研究出在互助组内和组与组之间互相借贷、调剂以及向外乡租用、购买等办法，解决缺乏农具、种籽和耕牛的问题。会后十多天来，卜家蓬乡很多农民天还没有亮就起床，下地锄草、施肥，或者成群结队地进城挑粪、上山砍柴烧炭。现在，全乡已买进饼肥一千多斤，增养小猪十八只，增积焦泥灰一千七百多担；少数农民已开始翻耕冬闲田。
    中共中央山东分局和山东省人民政府组织的春季农村工作检查组，已于十四日起分赴各地工作。检查组中有以省人民政府副主席王卓如为首的许多高级干部，连同其他干部共一百一十多人，分成十四个组。
    现在，山东省南部地区已全面开始春耕，全省有半数以上的农户订出了爱国丰产计划，各地供销合作社正在把大量肥料、农具等生产资料供应农民，检查组下乡后，将全面推动山东省的春耕生产和爱国丰产竞赛运动。
    为了配合农民春耕播种，人民银行华东区行现正积极准备发放农贷。华东区一九五三年农业贷款总数额较去年增加一点四六倍。今年贷款主要用途是帮助农民兴修水利、增施肥料、推广新式农具、防治病虫害、繁殖优良牲畜等；同时扶持各地基层供销合作社，活跃初级市场，帮助农民推销农、副产品以促进城乡物资交流。
