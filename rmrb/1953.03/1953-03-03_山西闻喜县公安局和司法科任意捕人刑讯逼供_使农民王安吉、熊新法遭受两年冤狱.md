Editor's note: The case of farmers Wang Anji and Xiong Xinfa suffering two years of wrongful imprisonment shows that in handling cases, public security and judicial organs in some areas do not rely on realistic investigation and research to find concrete evidence, but rely on brutal torture to extract confessions. Even after the interrogated persons have presented counter-evidence that should obviously be given serious consideration, they still insist on not investigating and insist that the interrogated persons confess according to their imagined situation. If this practice is not strictly prohibited, the harm to the country and the people will be infinite. According to a recent phone call from the Shanxi Provincial People's Procuratorate, Xiang Fangming, the head of the county judicial section who handled this case at the time, has been expelled from the Party and is prepared to be punished according to law. We believe that this case must be dealt with seriously, and other illegal cadres must also be given legal punishment.

Wang Dehe, a village cadre in Xiniu坞 Village, Second District, Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, was murdered on the second day of the second month of the summer lunar calendar in 1949. At that time, the district cadres and the county public security bureau did not conduct in-depth investigations, and subjectively and arbitrarily arrested farmers Wang Anji and Xiong Xinfa, insisting that they were the murderers. Wang and Xiong firmly denied it, and the county public security bureau cadres used cruel torture to force Wang and Xiong to confess. The county judicial section also only relied on the confessions forced out by the public security bureau, did not listen to Wang Anji's appeals, and did not conduct investigation and research, and sentenced Wang Anji to death. Later, the Linfen Branch of the Shanxi Provincial People's Court sent it back for retrial. In December 1950, during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the real murderer of Wang Dehe, Li Xiangzhi, was arrested after being exposed by the masses, but the county judicial section still did not immediately release Wang Anji and Xiong Xinfa, and continued to detain them for several months. This serious behavior of random arrest and detention and torture to extract confessions caused two innocent farmers to suffer two years of wrongful imprisonment, which was only exposed during the judicial reform movement.

Wang Anji is 28 years old this year, with a middle peasant background. In 1947, he joined the army after being mobilized by village cadre Wang Dehe, but because of ideological disagreements, he sneaked back to the village. Wang Dehe had mobilized him to return to the team. Xiong Xinfa is 24 years old this year, with a poor peasant background. He originally lived in Hengshui Town, Second District, Wenxi County. He joined the army in 1947, but also sneaked back to the village in August 1948 due to ideological backwardness, moved to Wang Dehe's house in Xiniu坞 Village (Wang Dehe was his father's sworn brother), and later married Wang Dehe's daughter, Wang Yuehao.

On the second day of the second month of the summer lunar calendar in 1949, after Wang Dehe was assassinated, Yang Xing, the district chief of the Second District, Li Ying, the district secretary, and Kong Qingyi went to examine the body and investigate. Based only on the fact that Xiong Xinfa was a deserter, they suspected that Wang Dehe was killed by Xiong Xinfa and tied Xiong to Hengshui Town Office for interrogation. Xiong firmly denied it and was released. Later, when district cadre Kong Qingyi investigated this case, based on the clues that Wang Dehe had mobilized Wang Anji to join the army and return to the team, he arbitrarily concluded that Wang Anji was the murderer. The county public security bureau also did not investigate and research, and blindly believed the materials reflected by Kong Qingyi, and went to arrest Wang Anji on the fourth day of the second month of the summer lunar calendar. At that time, Wang Anji was not at home, and they illegally detained Wang's mother and wife, and released them only on the 23rd. On the night of August 20 of the same year, district cadre Kong Qingyi led several militiamen to Wang Anji's house, beat Wang Anji's mother as soon as they entered the door, and tied Wang Anji away, escorted him to the district people's government for detention for three days, without even giving him water to drink. On August 24, he was escorted to the county judicial section by the district government. The judicial section, without asking the reason, put Wang Anji in shackles and transferred him to the county public security bureau for interrogation on the 25th. When Liu Ziying, the director of the detention center of the public security bureau, interrogated Wang Anji, Wang appealed that he was not in the village at all on the day Wang Dehe died and asked for a serious investigation. However, Liu Ziying did not listen to Wang Anji's appeal and only used a five-foot-long millstone lever for torture. He asked a question and beat him for a while, until late at night. Because Wang still did not admit it, he was put in handcuffs and locked in a cell. Later, he was tortured three more times. Wang Anji confessed when he was being tortured, but recanted when the torture stopped, and no definite confession was obtained. Then he was interrogated by Wang Aikuo, a member of the public security bureau. Wang Aikuo also used the same method to force a confession, beating Wang Anji with a five- or six-foot-long wooden rafter. He tortured him continuously several times a day from morning to night, without listening to Wang Anji's appeals or summoning the witnesses Wang Anji had proposed. Wang Anji still confessed when he could not bear the beating, and denied it when he was not being beaten. Wang Aikuo did not analyze this situation, but said, "If you didn't kill him, why would they detain you and not others? Could it be that the government detained you wrongly?" Then he used even more cruel torture with red-hot iron bars. Wang Anji could not bear the torture and confessed that he and the deceased's son-in-law Xiong Xinfa had conspired to kill Wang Dehe.

Zhang Daguang, deputy director of the county public security bureau, and Liu Jiajun, director of the police station, based solely on the confessions forced out by torture, went to Hengshui Town on November 7, 1949 to arrest Xiong Xinfa. Zhang Daguang interrogated Xiong Xinfa several times, but Xiong always denied it and presented many counter-evidence materials: such as the fact that he and farmer Liu Guanglu and others lived in Li Erwa's house (more than a mile away from Wang Dehe's house) on the night Wang Dehe died and did not leave the house all night; he did not know Wang Anji at all; Li Xiangzhi had an affair with Wang Dehe's wife, and Wang Dehe had fought with Li Xiangzhi the day before he was killed, etc. However, Zhang Daguang arbitrarily said that Xiong Xinfa was "making trouble" and asked Wang Aikuo to continue the interrogation. Wang Aikuo still used the method of beating with wooden rafters and scalding with iron bars to force Xiong Xinfa to confess that he and Wang Anji had killed Wang Dehe. However, because neither Wang Anji nor Xiong Xinfa were the real murderers, there were many contradictions in their confessions, and they could not be unified. Wang Aikuo asked Li Changyan, the leader of the prisoners' group and a counter-revolutionary, to write the same "self-criticism" for Wang Anji and Xiong Xinfa. This unified the confessions.

After the county public security bureau finished the interrogation, it transferred the entire case to the county judicial section and proposed the opinion that "he should be handed over to the people's court for execution." Li Pingzhang, the interrogator of the county judicial section, neither investigated nor listened to Wang Anji's appeal, and based on the public security bureau's indictment and Wang Anji's confession extracted under torture by the public security bureau, he sentenced Wang Anji to death on November 30, 1949 on the grounds of "opposing expansion of the army and masterminding the killing of village cadres." The death sentence was approved by Li Nan, the former county party secretary, and Bai Guilin (the current county party secretary) on the same day and sent to the Linfen Branch of the Shanxi Provincial People's Court for approval. The Linfen Branch sent it back for retrial on February 11, 1950. However, the county judicial section still did not pay attention to this, and continued to be interrogated by judges Li Mengping, Li Fawang, Li Hongtai, etc. in turn, forcing Wang Anji and Xiong Xinfa to confess, and still did not investigate and research the many counter-evidence materials proposed by Wang Anji, etc. Li Mengping also put Xiong Xinfa in handcuffs, and Li Hongtai used a pistol to threaten and force him to confess. However, Wang Anji and others still confessed when they were threatened, and then recanted after a while. Then, Xiang Fangming, the head of the county judicial section at the time, interrogated them. Xiang Fangming also did not listen to the counter-evidence materials or conduct investigations, but unilaterally relied on the materials of the public security bureau and determined that Wang Anji and others were murderers. Every time during the interrogation, because Wang Anji and others admitted several times and then recanted several times, he always scolded: "Not honest, get back, write a self-criticism." But he never conducted an investigation.

In December 1950, during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Li Xiangzhi, the real murderer of Wang Dehe, was arrested after being exposed by the masses. During the interrogation, although Li Xiangzhi confessed to the crime of killing Wang Dehe, the judicial section still subjectively believed that Wang and Xiong were murderers. In March 1951, when clearing backlog cases, Zhang Yunting, a member of the county education section at the time who participated in clearing backlog cases, believed that this case needed to be investigated and witnesses summoned. Xiang Fangming and Li Hongtai blamed Zhang Yunting and said, "You just listen to their nonsense?" After Zhang Yunting insisted again and again, he summoned Liu Guanglu and Wang Xiaoai, the deceased's wife, and six other people, and went to Xiniu坞 Village to conduct investigations, and repeatedly interrogated Li Xiangzhi, confirming that Wang Dehe was killed by Li Xiangzhi, and Wang Anji and Xiong Xinfa were innocent. However, when Zhang Yunting reported the situation, Xiang Fangming and Li Hongtai did not express any opinions. Later, Zhang Yunting returned to work in the education section, and the case file was suspended again. In June of the same year, Xiang Fangming interrogated Wang Yuehao, the deceased's daughter, and Li Shudao, Li Xiangzhi's younger brother, and found the murder weapon used by Li Xiangzhi. Only then did he sentence Li Xiangzhi to death on July 24. Wang and Xiong were released from prison on August 4. When releasing them, Xiang Fangming also said, "You are not honest; if you were honest, we would have released you earlier."

After the wrongful imprisonment of Wang Anji and Xiong Xinfa occurred, the Wenxi County Public Security Bureau and the Judicial Section neither conducted a review nor reported to the higher authorities, and the county's leading organs also remained silent and did not take any action. It was not until the judicial reform movement began last year and the Wenxi County Judicial Reform Inspection Team conducted an inspection that it was re-exposed.

    山西闻喜县公安局和司法科任意捕人刑讯逼供
    使农民王安吉、熊新法遭受两年冤狱
    编者按：农民王安吉、熊新法遭受两年冤狱的案件，说明某些地区的公安、司法机关在办案中不依靠实事求是的调查研究，找出真凭实据，而依靠野蛮的刑讯逼供。甚至在被审讯者提出显然应该重视的反证材料之后，他们仍坚持不作调查，硬要被审讯者依照他们所想像的情形招供。这种作法如不严厉禁止，对国家和人民的危害将是无穷的。据最近山西省人民检察署电话，当时审理这个案件的县司法科科长方向明已受到开除党籍的处分，准备依法予以惩办。我们认为这一案件必须严肃处理，对其他违法的干部也必须给以法律处分。
    山西省闻喜县二区西牛坞村村干部王德河在一九四九年夏历二月初二日被人杀害。当时区干部和县公安局未深入调查，就主观臆断地先后逮捕了农民王安吉、熊新法，硬说他们是杀人凶犯。王、熊坚不承认，县公安局干部就使用残酷的刑法，强迫王、熊招认。县司法科也只凭公安局逼问出来的口供，不听王安吉等的申诉，也不调查研究，就判处王安吉死刑。后山西省人民法院临汾分院发回更审。到一九五○年十二月镇压反革命运动中，经群众检举，逮捕了真正杀害王德河的凶犯李相芝，但是县司法科仍不立即把王安吉、熊新法释放，又继续扣押了数月。这种严重的乱捕乱扣、刑讯逼供行为，使两个无辜农民遭受了两年的冤狱，直到司法改革运动中才被揭发出来。
    王安吉今年二十八岁，中农成分，一九四七年经村干部王德河动员参军，但因思想不通，又偷跑回村。王德河曾动员过他归队。熊新法今年二十四岁，贫农成分，原住在闻喜二区横水镇，一九四七年参军，也因思想落后，于一九四八年八月偷跑回村，移住西牛坞村王德河家（王德河是他父亲的盟弟），以后又和王德河的女儿王月好结了婚。
    一九四九年夏历二月初二日王德河被人暗杀后，二区区长杨形、区秘书李英及孔庆义去验尸调查。他们仅根据熊新法是逃兵，就怀疑王德河是熊新法杀的，将熊绑送横水镇公所审问。熊坚不承认，就释放了。以后区干部孔庆义调查此案时，根据王德河曾动员过王安吉参军和归队等线索，就武断地认定王安吉是杀人凶手。县公安局也没有侦察研究，偏信孔庆义反映的材料，在夏历二月初四日去逮捕王安吉。当时王安吉不在家，竟非法扣押了王的母亲和妻子，到二十三日才释放。同年八月二十日夜，区干部孔庆义领民兵数人到王安吉家，进门就殴打王安吉的母亲，并绑走了王安吉，解送区人民政府扣押三天，连水都不给喝。八月二十四日由区政府解送县司法科。司法科不问情由，就给王安吉带上脚镣，在二十五日转送县公安局审讯。公安局看守所长刘子英讯问王安吉时，王申诉说：王德河死的那天，他根本没有在村里，要求认真调查。但刘子英不听王安吉的申诉，只是拿五尺长的磨杆刑讯。问一会打一会，直打至深夜。因王始终不承认，又给带上背铐，关进监房。以后又连续刑讯三次，刑讯时王安吉就承认，停止刑讯时又翻供，始终没有问出确实口供。接着又由公安局股员王爱魁审讯。王爱魁也用同样办法逼供，拿五、六尺长的木椽打王安吉，一天中从早到晚连续刑讯数次，不听王安吉的申诉，也不传讯王安吉所提出的反证人。王安吉仍然是被打得忍受不了时就承认，不打时就推翻口供。王爱魁对这种情况不加分析，反说：“不是你杀的，为什么扣你不扣别人？难道政府错扣了你不成？”接着又更残酷地用烧红的铁条刑讯。王安吉受刑不过，信口承认了王德河是他和死者的女婿熊新法合谋杀害的。
    县公安局副局长张大光和派出所长刘甲俊单凭刑讯逼问出来的口供，就在一九四九年十一月七日亲赴横水镇逮捕了熊新法。张大光审讯熊新法几次，熊始终不承认，并提出许多反证材料：如王德河死的那天晚上，他和农民刘光禄等都住在李二娃家（距王德河家一里多地），一夜没有出门；他根本不认识王安吉；李相芝和王德河的老婆通奸，王德河被害的前一天曾和李相芝打过架，等等。但张大光武断地说熊新法是“捣鬼”，又叫王爱魁继续审讯。王爱魁仍采用木椽打和铁条烫的办法，强逼熊新法招认了王德河是他和王安吉杀的。但因王安吉和熊新法都不是真正的杀人犯，所以供词中矛盾很多，得不到统一，王爱魁就叫犯人组长反革命犯李长彦给王安吉和熊新法写同样的“反省书”。这样统一了供词。
    县公安局审讯终结后，即将全案移送县司法科，并提出“应交人民法庭处死刑”的意见。县司法科审讯员李平章既不调查，也不听王安吉的申诉，即依据公安局的起诉书和王安吉在公安局被刑讯逼出的口供，以“反对扩军，主谋杀死村干”的罪名，于一九四九年十一月三十日判处王安吉死刑，当日由前任县委书记李楠、县长白桂林（现任县委书记）签名核准判死刑，送山西省人民法院临汾分院批核。临汾分院于一九五○年二月十一日发回更审。但是县司法科仍未因此引起注意，仍继续由审判员李孟平、李发旺、李鸿太等轮流审讯，逼王安吉、熊新法招认，对王安吉等提出的很多反证材料仍不作调查研究。李孟平又给熊新法带上背铐，李鸿太曾用手枪威吓逼问。但王安吉等仍是在受威吓时就承认，一会又翻供。接着又由当时的县司法科科长方向明审讯，方向明也不听取反证材料，进行调查，一味片面依据公安局的材料，认定王安吉等是杀人犯。每次审讯时都因为王安吉等数次承认，又数次翻供，他总是大骂：“不老实，滚回去，写个反省。”可是始终不进行调查。
    一九五○年十二月镇压反革命运动时，经群众检举，逮捕了真正杀害王德河的凶犯李相芝。在审讯中，李相芝虽招认了杀害王德河的罪行，但司法科仍然主观地认为王、熊是杀人犯。一九五一年三月清理积案时，参加清理积案的当时县教育科科员张云亭认为这案件需要调查、传讯证人。方向明、李鸿太责备张云亭说：“你就听他们胡说啦？”经张云亭再三坚持，传讯了刘光禄和死者的老婆王小爱等六人，并去西牛坞村进行调查，又反复审讯李相芝，证实了王德河是李相芝杀害的，王安吉、熊新法无罪。但在张云亭汇报情况时，方向明、李鸿太却不表示任何意见。以后张云亭又返回教育科工作，案卷又悬隔起来。到同年六月，方向明又讯问了死者的女儿王月好及李相芝的弟弟李守道等，并起出李相芝杀人的凶器，才在七月二十四日判处李相芝死刑。到八月四日才将王、熊释放出狱。在释放时，方向明还说：“你们不老实；要老实的话，早放你们了。”
    王安吉、熊新法的冤狱事件发生后，闻喜县公安局和司法科既没有检讨，也没有向上级报告，县的领导机关也不声不响地未作任何处理。直到去年司法改革运动开始，闻喜县司法改革检查组进行检查，才重新揭露出来。
