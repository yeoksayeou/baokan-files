Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 14th: Our special correspondent reports: The US side, eager to completely rupture the armistice negotiations, is resorting to all means, sending aircraft to bomb the Kaesong neutral zone, where the Korean-Chinese delegation is stationed, on March 13th. At around 5:40 AM on the 13th, an enemy plane intruded into the Kaesong airspace, flying low and bombing the area, injuring three civilians and destroying several houses. More than 20 bombs dropped by enemy aircraft have been found in the Kaesong city center area near our delegation's residence. At the bombed site, scattered with many craters and shrapnel, there are still several unexploded US-made bombs, serving as evidence of the US side's undeniable guilt. At the time of the enemy aircraft bombing, the sky was already slightly bright, with no rain or clouds, and the large ruins of Kaesong and the many houses rebuilt by the citizens on the ruins were clearly visible. In the six days before March 13th, enemy aircraft had repeatedly intruded into the Kaesong neutral zone airspace at night, flying low for reconnaissance, diving and circling. The weather was generally clear at that time, and the searchlight beams set up in the Panmunjom marking conference area and the neutral zone were very clear. These facts show that the March 13th incident of US aircraft bombing Kaesong was not only deliberately created by the US side, but also had been planned for several days in advance. The extreme seriousness of the March 13th incident lies in the fact that it is the climax of a series of provocative actions by the US side. In the month or so before this incident, the US side had sent armed agents to intrude into the Panmunjom conference area to set fires, burn houses, and shoot and wound our military police. On March 2nd, dozens of US armed personnel attacked the conference area with light machine guns and other weapons, firing at our security officers who were patrolling the conference area in vehicles; on March 9th, the US side shelled the conference area, and US military aircraft had repeatedly blatantly intruded into the conference area. At the same time, the US liaison officers adopted an attitude of glib denial and indifference towards these many incidents. People remember that shortly after the Korean armistice negotiations began in 1951, the US side also sent aircraft to bomb the Kaesong neutral zone on August 22nd, attempting to murder our delegation personnel. At that time, the US side attempted to use this unprecedentedly despicable means to force the negotiations to be interrupted, in order to freely launch military adventures and use force to realize the dream of drawing the military demarcation line into our positions for 12,000 square kilometers. However, in the "Summer Offensive" and "Autumn Offensive" launched by Van Fleet, the US side only lost 200,000 soldiers and gained nothing. As a result, the US representative had to return to Panmunjom, put away their fallacy of "air and sea superiority," and accept our fair solution of taking the actual battle line as the military demarcation line. Today, the American aggressors are again attempting to repeat this set of destructive tactics, but observers here point out that history will not be a simple repetition. The strength of the Korean-Chinese People's forces is now even stronger than in 1951. If the American aggressors dare to completely break off the negotiations and launch military adventures today, then, as General Nam Il pointed out in a recent letter to the US representative Harrison, they will suffer even more severe blows.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 14th: The US side's provocative acts of wantonly destroying the Korean armistice negotiation conference area and the neutral zone have reached a state of madness. At around 5:40 AM on the morning of March 13th, US military aircraft systematically bombed the center of Kaesong city, wounding three people and destroying many houses. According to our preliminary investigation, more than 20 bombs dropped by the US side have been found, some of which have not yet exploded. At the liaison officers' meeting between the two sides that afternoon, our delegation's chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhu Ran, was ordered to lodge a serious protest with the US side regarding this incident of wantonly violating the agreement, and solemnly pointed out that the US side should recognize the extreme seriousness of its continuous violations of the agreement. The US chief liaison officer, Calk, disclaimed: Regarding this incident, he will contact the US's appropriate authorities and conduct a joint investigation before the afternoon of the 14th.
Recently, the US side has continuously and increasingly destroyed and torn up various administrative agreements of the armistice negotiations, escalating its provocative actions in the conference area and the neutral zone. The US side set fires and opened fire in the conference area, wounding our military police, opened fire and shelled the conference area; US military aircraft constantly intruded into the conference area, and patrolled and reconnoitered at low altitude over the Kaesong neutral zone day and night, even bombing the center of Kaesong city. The US side's reckless acts of destroying the agreement completely demonstrate that the US side is planning to destroy the maintenance of the conference area and the neutral zone, in order to completely break off the negotiations. Our chief liaison officer has been ordered to point out that if the US side is determined to destroy the maintenance of the conference area and the neutral zone in order to completely break off the armistice negotiations, the US side should make a clear statement and bear all its responsibilities. The administrative agreement of the armistice negotiations will never allow the US side to wantonly destroy it.

    我方严重抗议美机轰炸开城中立区
    【新华社开城十四日电】本社特派记者报道：美方急于完全破裂停战谈判，竟不择手段，在三月十三日派遣飞机轰炸朝中代表团的驻地开城中立区。十三日晨五时四十分左右，敌机一架侵入开城上空低飞轰炸，市民三人受伤，房屋数间被炸坏。在我方代表团驻地附近的开城市中心区，已发现敌机所投的炸弹二十多枚。在散布着许多弹坑和弹片的被炸地点，还有几个尚未爆炸的美制炸弹，作为美方无可逃避的罪责的证据。在敌机轰炸时，天已微明，无雨无云，开城的大片废墟和市民们在废墟上重建的许多房屋清晰可见。三月十三日以前的六天中，敌机曾多次在夜间侵入开城中立区上空低飞侦察，俯冲盘旋，当时天气一般都很晴朗，设在板门店标志会场区和中立区的探照灯光柱非常清晰。这些事实说明：十三日美机轰炸开城的事件，不但是美方蓄意制造的，而且事先曾经过若干天的布置。十三日事件的极端严重性，更在于它是美方一系列挑衅行动的高潮。在这事件之前的一个多月中，美方曾派遣武装特务侵入板门店会场区放火，烧房，枪伤我方军事警察。三月二日，美方武装人员数十人曾以轻机枪等武器攻击会场区，对乘车在会场区巡视的我方安全军官开枪射击；三月九日，美方炮击会场区，美方的军用飞机更曾多次明目张胆地侵越会场区，同时美方联络官对这许多事件一概采取了信口否认、毫不在意的态度。人们记得：一九五一年朝鲜停战谈判开始后不久，美方也曾于八月二十二日派遣飞机轰炸开城中立区，企图谋害我方代表团人员。当时美方企图用这种史无先例的卑鄙手段迫使谈判中断，以便放手发动军事冒险，用武力来实现把军事分界线划入我方阵地一万二千平方公里的梦想。但是在范佛里特发动的“夏季攻势”和“秋季攻势”中，美方只是损兵折将二十万人而一无所得。结果，美方代表不得不回到板门店来，收拾起他们“海空军优势”的谬论，接受我方以实际战线为军事分界线的公平解决。而今天美国侵略者竟又企图重演这一套破坏手段，但此间观察家指出：历史将不是简单的重复。朝中人民部队现在的力量比一九五一年时已更为强大，美国侵略者今天若敢于完全破裂谈判，发动军事冒险，那末正如南日将军最近给美方代表哈利逊的一封信中所指出的，他们将遭到更严重的打击。
    【新华社开城十四日电】美方恣意破坏朝鲜停战谈判会场区和中立区的挑衅行为，已达到疯狂的地步。三月十三日清晨五时四十分左右，美方军用飞机有计划地投弹轰炸开城市区中心，打伤三人，炸毁房屋多处。据我方初步调查，已发现美方所投掷的炸弹二十多枚，其中一部分仍未爆炸。当天下午双方联络官会议上，我方代表团首席联络官朱然上校，奉命对这一恣意违反协议的事件，向美方先行口头提出严重抗议，并严正指出美方应该认识到其不断破坏协议的极端严重性。美方首席联络官卡洛克诿称：关于这一事件他将和美方的适当当局联系，在十四日下午前来进行共同调查。
    近来美方连续不断地破坏与撕毁停战谈判的各项行政协议，变本加厉地在会场区和中立区进行挑衅行动。美方在会场区内纵火开枪打伤我方军事警察，开枪射击并炮击会场区；美方军用飞机不断侵入会场区，并日夜在开城中立区上空低空盘旋侦察，甚至于在开城市区中心投弹轰炸。美方这种肆无忌惮地破坏协议的行为，完全说明了美方是有计划地破坏会场区和中立区的维持，以便彻底破裂谈判。我方首席联络官业已奉命指出：如果美方决心破坏会场区和中立区的维持，以使停战谈判彻底破裂，美方就应该明白作出表示，并担负其一切责任。停战谈判的行政协议决不容许美方恣意予以破坏。
