Xinhua News Agency, March 26th, Dusseldorf Dispatch from the German News Agency: The Executive Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement calling on the West German people to wage a resolute struggle against the Bonn-Paris war treaties.

The statement pointed out that the passage of these treaties is against the will of the German people, it abandons the German people's right to national self-determination and directly threatens the German people.

The statement called on the German people to bravely participate in the patriotic movement, launch resistance actions outside of parliament, in order to achieve the following basic demands: Hold a four-power conference to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and restore German unity; withdraw all occupying forces; hold free all-German national assembly elections to produce an all-German government.

The statement called on the West German people, regardless of gender or age, to strengthen the struggle against the war treaties and the Bonn regime under the banner of striving for peace, unity and national independence, and overthrow the Adenauer government.

Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, Berlin Dispatch: The movement of the entire German people against the implementation of the Bonn-Paris war treaties is continuing to surge. The Waldenburg-Baden State (West Germany) organization of the German Federation for Unity, Peace and Freedom held a conference in Stuttgart. A total of three hundred representatives attended the conference. The conference adopted a resolution expressing support for the joint statement of the People's Chamber and the Senate of the German Democratic Republic declaring the Bonn-Paris war treaties invalid. Attendees also expressed that they would more resolutely fight against the Bonn-Paris war treaties in the future. The conference elected the council of the Waldenburg-Baden State of the German Federation for Unity, Peace and Freedom. The council includes more than fifty well-known social figures, trade union leaders, pastors and representatives of other strata of the people.

In Hoche, North Rhine-Westphalia, West Germany, five hundred women unanimously declared that they would prevent their husbands and sons from shedding blood for the profits of the imperialists.

Kenner, chairman of the War Victims Association in southern Hesse, West Germany, fiercely opposed the Bonn Bundestag's ratification of the Bonn-Paris war treaties on behalf of 240 local trade union organizations at a rally.

The local textile workers' union in Tübingen unanimously passed a resolution opposing the Bonn-Paris treaty and demanding the conclusion of a just peace treaty. 1,100 workers at the Kugler-Müller factory in Nuremberg demanded large-scale strike action to prevent the implementation of the Bonn-Paris war treaties.

The universality of anti-Bonn government war policy sentiment in West Germany can also be seen from the statistics of the Bielefeld opinion poll institute in West Germany. This opinion poll institute admitted that the survey results showed that 71 percent of West German workers and 68 percent of the generation who had experienced the war opposed Bonn's militarization policy.

In the German Democratic Republic, the People's Chamber, the Senate, and the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany receive a large number of letters and telegrams every day protesting against the West German revanchists' approval of the Bonn-Paris treaties. Rallies were held in towns and villages across the country to oppose the war treaty. In Rostock alone, 25 large meetings and 578 small meetings were held to protest Adenauer's anti-national policies.

Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, TASS Berlin, March 27th: According to Berlin democratic newspapers, the Union of Republican Youth of France, the Union of Young Women of France, the West German branch of the Free German Youth League, and the Central Committee of the Free German Youth League issued a joint notice to the youth of Germany and France, calling on them to fight against the Bonn and Paris military treaties.

The notice emphasized that these treaties threaten the lives and future of the youth of Germany and France. The notice said that the reactionaries want to force the youth of France and Germany to serve in the European mercenary army manipulated by American bankers and arms magnates, and to serve as cannon fodder, sacrificing their lives for the benefit of others. This must not be allowed to happen. The youth of France and Germany, united with all patriots, have enough strength to resist the warmongers and victoriously defend their lives and their future. At no time will the youth of our two countries take up arms against the great Soviet Union. At no time will the youth of France and Germany fight each other.

The notice also emphasized: Only a free and independent France and a peace-loving, democratic, and unified Germany can guarantee the close friendship and good-neighborly relations between the French and German peoples, and the happy future of the younger generation.

The notice said: The common struggle, brotherly friendship and unity of the youth of France and Germany are the guarantee of the victory of our just cause. German and French youth organizations call on the youth of France and Germany to fight together against the Bonn and Paris military treaties, to fight for a peaceful solution to the German question, and to fight for a unified Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty. The notice called on the youth of France and Germany to take joint action to withdraw American occupying forces from West Germany and France, and to fight for the improvement of the situation of the youth.

    【新华社二十六日讯】据德意志通讯社杜塞尔多夫二十五日讯：德国共产党执行委员会发表声明，号召西德人民进行坚决的斗争，反对波恩与巴黎战争条约。
    声明指出，通过这些条约是违背德国人民的意志的，它废弃德国人民民族自决的权利并直接威胁德国人民。
    声明号召德国人民勇敢地参加到爱国运动中，开展议会以外的抵抗行动，以达到下列基本要求：举行四大国会议以缔结对德和约并恢复德国的统一；撤退一切占领军；举行自由的全德国民议会选举以产生一个全德政府。
    声明号召西德人民，不分男女老少，在争取和平、统一和民族独立的旗帜下，加强反对战争条约和波恩政权的斗争，推翻阿登纳政府。
    【新华社二十八日讯】柏林消息：全德人民反对实现波恩与巴黎战争条约的运动正在继续高涨。德国争取统一、和平与自由运动联合会瓦登堡—巴登州（西德）组织在斯图加特举行了一次会议，参加会议的共有三百名代表，会议通过了一项决议，表示支持德意志民主共和国人民议院和参议院宣布波恩与巴黎战争条约无效的联合声明，到会者并表示今后将更加坚决地进行反对波恩与巴黎战争条约的斗争。会议选出了德国争取统一、和平与自由运动联合会瓦登堡—巴登州理事会，理事会中包括了五十多名著名的社会人士、工会领袖、牧师与其他阶层人民的代表。
    在西德北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州的霍赫地方，五百名妇女一致宣称，她们将阻止她们的丈夫和儿子为帝国主义者的利润而流血牺牲。
    西德黑森州南部战争受害者协会主席肯纳在一次集会上代表二百四十个工会地方组织，猛烈地反对波恩联邦议院批准波恩与巴黎战争条约。
    土宾根的纺织工人地方工会一致通过决议反对波恩与巴黎条约，要求订立公正的和约。纽伦堡的库格尔·穆勒工厂的一千一百名工人要求用大规模罢工的行动来阻止实现波恩与巴黎战争条约。
    反对波恩政府战争政策的情绪在西德之普遍，从西德俾雷腓尔德民意测验所的统计也可以看出。这个民意测验所承认，调查的结果有百分之七十一的西德工人和百分之六十八的经历过战争的一代人反对波恩军国主义化政策。
    在德意志民主共和国，人民议院、参议院和民主德国全国阵线全国委员会，每天都收到大批抗议西德复仇主义者批准波恩与巴黎条约的信件与电报。全国各地城镇和乡村都举行了集会，反对战争条约。仅仅在罗斯托克一地，就举行了二十五次大会和五百七十八次小会，抗议阿登纳反民族的政策。

    通告强调说：这些条约威胁着德国和法国青年们的生活和未来。通告说：反动派想迫使法国和德国的青年们为美国银行家和军火大王操纵的欧洲雇佣军服役，使他们充当炮灰，为了别人的利益而牺牲自己的性命。这是决不容许发生的事。法国和德国的青年们和一切爱国者联合起来，就有足够的力量，抵抗战争贩子，胜利地保卫住自己的生命和自己的未来。无论何时，我们两国的青年们决不拿起武器反对伟大的苏联。无论何时，法国和德国的青年们决不交战。
    通告还着重说：只有自由的、独立的法国和爱好和平的、民主的、统一的德国，才能保证法国和德国人民的紧密友谊和善邻关系，以及年青一代的幸福的未来。
    通告说：法国和德国青年的共同斗争，兄弟般的友谊和团结，是我们正义事业胜利的保证。德国和法国的青年组织号召法国和德国的青年们共同为反对波恩和巴黎军事条约而斗争，为和平解决德国问题而斗争，为争取统一的德国和缔结和约而斗争。通告号召法国和德国的青年们共同行动起来，为使美国占领军队撤退西德和法国而斗争，为改善青年们的处境而斗争。
