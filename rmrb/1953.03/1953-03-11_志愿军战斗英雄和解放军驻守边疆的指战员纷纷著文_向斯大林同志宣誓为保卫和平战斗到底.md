The Soviet Air Force's bravery, decisiveness, resourcefulness, determination, superior advanced military science and technology, as well as their patriotism and internationalism, will always be our model for combat and learning. It encourages us to grow stronger in combat, giving the American aerial bandits a heavy blow. All of this will forever be engraved in our hearts."

    Zhang Jihui then wrote: "In these days of immense grief, standing on the front lines of defending the Far East and world peace, I swear to our most respected friend and mentor Marshal Stalin: We must redouble our efforts to conscientiously study the advanced military science and experience of the Soviet Air Force, and, together with the heroic Korean People's Army, give the American aggressors an even heavier blow."
