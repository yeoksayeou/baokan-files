Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 11th: The success of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's reconstruction of the No. 8 blast furnace into China's first automated blast furnace was decisively influenced by the technical guidance of Soviet experts and the material assistance of the Soviet people. The most up-to-date automated equipment needed for the reconstruction of the No. 8 blast furnace, such as hoists, large-cover machines, sounding-rod hoists, electric mud guns, taphole openers, automatic meters, automatic weighing cars, and burners, were all supplied to us by the Soviet Union. Some of these machines and equipment are not yet in widespread use even in the Soviet Union, but the Soviet people were the first to enthusiastically supply them to us. Some of the equipment was specially designed by Soviet experts and manufactured for China by Soviet machine manufacturing plants.

The spirit of selfless labor and high responsibility shown by Soviet experts in the reconstruction of the No. 8 blast furnace is something the Chinese people will never forget. In order to achieve the highest efficiency of the No. 8 blast furnace's material hoisting machine, a Soviet electrical expert was so busy that he did not even have time to eat, personally adjusting the electrical automatic control device day and night. One night, a responsible cadre from Anshan Iron and Steel's capital construction department went to express his appreciation and wanted to work with him, but he firmly refused, saying: "You are the cadre responsible for the overall leadership of Anshan Iron and Steel's capital construction, and you have many problems to solve every day. Go back to your residence and get a good rest!" One Soviet expert became ill due to overwork, with a fever of forty degrees, but he only rested for one night and went back to work at the construction site the next morning with his illness. The workers were very concerned and said to him: "Your illness has not yet healed, go back to your residence and rest!" His answer was: "I cannot let my illness affect the completion of the engineering task." In the various projects of the construction of the No. 8 blast furnace system, more than 800 important suggestions made by Soviet experts played a huge role in ensuring project quality and accelerating project progress. For example, according to the suggestion of Soviet experts, the furnace body of the hot blast stove was increased by 5.6 meters, which increased the preheating area of ​​the cold air by nearly 30%, creating conditions for the implementation of the "full air volume" ironmaking method and increasing pig iron production during the production of the No. 8 blast furnace.

Soviet experts often said to the Chinese workers who were building the No. 8 blast furnace: "When dear Comrade Stalin sent us to China, his task for us was: not only to use the most advanced technology to help China in its construction, but also to completely impart the most advanced technology to the Chinese working people, so that the Chinese working people can quickly master the most advanced technology and carry out construction themselves." Therefore, in their work, the experts racked their brains and came up with many effective ways to improve the technical level of Chinese workers. For example, a Soviet expert working at the No. 5 blower construction site, when explaining mechanical principles to the workers, would lead the workers to the machine when he came to difficult points, disassemble the machine, and explain it piece by piece, sometimes repeating a machine part seven or eight times. In the work, whenever installing two or more identical parts, he always installed one by himself first, so that everyone could learn. Once, when installing a part, he gathered the workers together and explained three installation methods in a row. Someone asked: "One method can be installed, why explain so many?" The expert said: "I want to teach all I know to Chinese comrades!" (Attached picture)

The news of Comrade Stalin's death came, and the blast furnace ironmaking workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company gathered in a corner of the construction site with heavy hearts to listen to the broadcast. Xinhua News Agency reporter Yue Guofang

    在改建鞍钢第八号炼铁炉的工程中
    苏联专家的技术指导起了巨大的作用
     【新华社鞍山十一日电】国营鞍山钢铁公司改建第八号炼铁炉为我国第一座自动化炼铁炉的成功，苏联专家的技术指导和苏联人民的物质援助起了决定性的作用。改建第八号炼铁炉所需用的卷扬机、大盖机、探料尺卷扬机、电动泥炮机、开口机、自动计器、自动称量车、燃烧器等最新式自动化设备，都是由苏联供给我国的。其中有些机器设备，目前在苏联也还没有普遍使用，但苏联人民却首先热情地供给了我们。有的设备是由苏联专家亲自设计并由苏联机器制造厂为我国特制的。
    在改建第八号炼铁炉工程中，所表现出来的苏联专家忘我劳动和高度负责的精神，是中国人民永远不能忘记的。为了第八号炼铁炉运料卷扬机达到最高效能，一位苏联电器专家忙得连饭也顾不得吃，不分昼夜的亲自调整电气自动操纵装置。一个夜晚，鞍钢基本建设部门一位负责干部去慰问他，并且要和他一起工作，可是他坚决地没有同意，他说：“你是负责全面领导鞍钢基本建设的干部，天天有许多问题需要你去解决，你回住所去好好休息吧！”有一位苏联专家曾因工作过度劳累而患了病，体温烧到四十度，但他只休息了一个晚上，第二天一早就又带病到工地工作了。工人们十分关怀地对他说：“你的病还没有好，快回住所去休息吧！”他的回答是：“我不能因为我的病，影响了工程任务的完成。”在建筑第八号炼铁炉系统的各项工程中，苏联专家提出的八百多条重要建议，对保证工程质量和加快工程进度起了巨大作用。例如，按照苏联专家建议，把热风炉的炉体增高五点六公尺，这样就使冷风的预热面积增加了将近百分之三十，给第八号炼铁炉生产时实行“全风量”的炼铁方法、提高生铁产量创造了条件。
    苏联专家常常对建筑第八号炼铁炉的我国职工们说：“亲爱的斯大林同志派我们来中国时，给我们的任务是：不仅要用最先进的技术来帮助中国进行建设，还要把最先进的技术完全传授给中国劳动人民，使中国劳动人民很快地掌握起最先进的技术，自己进行建设。”因此在工作中，专家们都费尽心思，想出许多有效的办法，来提高中国工人的技术水平。如在五号鼓风机工地工作的一位苏联专家，他在给工人讲解机械原理时，讲到难懂的地方就领着工人到机器旁边，把机器拆开，一件一件的讲解，有时把一个机器的部件重复讲七、八遍。在工作中每当安装两个以上的相同部件时，他总是先亲手安装一个，让大家学习。有一次在安装一个部件时，他把工人找到一块，一连讲了三个安装方法，有人问：“有一个方法就可以安装上了，何必讲这么多？”专家说：“我要把所知道的都教给中国同志！”（附图片）
    斯大林同志逝世的消息传来，鞍山钢铁公司高炉炼铁工人怀着沉痛的心情，聚集在工地一角静听广播。    　新华社记者岳国芳摄
