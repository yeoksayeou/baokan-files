    Scientific and Technical Personnel of Various Institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Intensify the Study of Russian

    Since December of last year, scientific and technical personnel of various institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have successively launched a crash program to learn Russian, which has now shifted to regular study. The movement to learn Russian at the Chinese Academy of Sciences drew on the experience of Tsinghua University and Peking University in learning Russian and was carried out on the basis of the ideological remolding movement of scientific and technical personnel and the demand to learn advanced Soviet science. The vast majority of researchers and technicians in various institutes enthusiastically participated in the study. After about a month of concentrated effort, staff in the Beijing, Shanghai, and Northeast districts generally memorized 1,200 to 1,300 new words and can now slowly read professional Russian books. In order to consolidate the learning results and continuously improve, the Academy stipulates that researchers and technicians of various institutes can spend one hour of their working time each day studying Russian in the future.

    In order to mourn Comrade Stalin, all teachers and students of Shandong Medical College are more actively studying advanced Soviet medical theories and experiences. Recently, the professors of the college studied and discussed advanced experiences such as Pavlov's theory and Soviet higher medical education.

In recent years, professors at Shandong Medical College have initially learned about advanced Soviet medicine and have experienced the importance of learning advanced Soviet medicine. The Russian professional book reading crash course held by the college this year has attracted a large number of participants. The second phase is currently underway, with a total of more than 100 people. The college has also ordered a large number of Russian-language medical books. The students are determined to learn from advanced Soviet medical workers as an example and intensify their studies.

    Xinjiang Launches Uyghur Telegraph Service, Welcomed by the People

    Thirty-three county towns in Xinjiang Province have launched Uyghur telegraph services, which have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of ethnic minorities. The Uyghur people of Xinjiang account for more than 80% of the province's total population. For many years, they have not been able to transmit telegrams in their own language. In April 1951, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government Postal and Telecommunications Administration launched the Uyghur telegraph service, gradually promoting it from the cities of Dihua and Yili to the entire province, and successively trained more than 100 ethnic minority cadres familiar with Uyghur telegraph services, gradually improving technology. According to statistics in September 1952, a total of 1,001,800 Uyghur telegraph characters were sent and received in the province in one year and five months, which was 6.6% more than Chinese telegrams (excluding military and government telegrams) during the same period. In some places, Uyghur farmers are also happily going to the postal and telecommunications bureau to send telegrams.

    中国科学院各研究所科学技术人员加紧学习俄文
    中国科学院各研究所的科学技术人员去年十二月以来，先后开展了一个学习俄文的突击运动，现已转入经常学习。中国科学院的学习俄文运动是吸取了清华大学和北京大学学习俄文的经验，并在科学技术人员思想改造运动后要求学习苏联先进科学的基础上进行的。各研究所极大部分研究人员和技术人员都热情地参加了学习。北京区、上海区和东北区各研究所的工作人员经过一个月左右的突击，一般都能记得一千二、三百生字，现在都已能慢慢地阅读专业俄文书籍。为了巩固学习成果并不断提高，科学院规定各研究所的研究人员和技术人员今后可以每天在工作时间内抽出一小时学习俄文。
