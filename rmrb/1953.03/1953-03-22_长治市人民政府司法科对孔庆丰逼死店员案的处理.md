Response to People's Daily Readers' Criticism and Suggestions:

    The Changzhi Municipal People's Government Justice Department in Shanxi Province writes: We have reviewed the People's Daily's January 23rd publication of "Why Has the Changzhi Municipal People's Government Delayed Handling the Kong Qingfeng Case of Forcing a Shop Assistant to Death?" We have indeed delayed in this case. In addition to demonstrating our lack of proactive work and our vague working-class ideology, it exposes our serious bureaucracy. This case has now been handled: After the "Five-Anti" campaign, the lawless capitalist Kong Qingfeng fabricated and exaggerated the shortcomings of shop assistant Han Guolu (Le), deliberately retaliated, and drove Han Guolu to commit suicide by jumping into a well, arousing the public anger of the broad masses of workers and shop assistants. It has been decided to sentence him to five years of imprisonment in accordance with the law.

    长治市人民政府司法科对孔庆丰逼死店员案的处理
    山西省长治市人民政府司法科来信：人民日报一月二十三日刊载的“长治市人民政府为何迟迟不处理孔庆丰逼死店员案”的意见，我们已经作了检查。我们对这个案件确有拖延现象，除了说明我们的工作不主动，工人阶级思想模糊以外，更暴露了我们严重的官僚主义。这一案件现在已经作了处理：违法资本家孔庆丰在“五反”后仍然目无法纪，捏造和扩大店员韩过禄（乐）的缺点，蓄意报复，以致逼使韩过禄投井自杀，引起广大工人店员群众的公愤，决定依法判以有期徒刑五年。
