Central South Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration
Reversing the Passive Waiting Mentality in Basic Construction Preparation Work

The Central South Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration's basic construction preparation work was very poor, but with the help of the Ministry of Heavy Industry's inspection team, the situation has begun to improve.

Although the Central South Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration's basic construction tasks this year are quite heavy, the leading cadres of the bureau have not paid enough attention to this work. The bureau organized ten inspection teams with more than ninety people in total to inspect the work in various mines. Among them, seven inspection teams with more than sixty people specialized in inspecting production, and only three teams inspected basic construction, of which one team also had to take into account the inspection of production. Up to now, the bureau's basic construction division only has one of the three division chiefs, and five of the ten sections are still missing section chiefs. The manager of the engineering company has not yet been appointed. Some leading cadres have no confidence in completing the basic construction tasks for 1953, only talk about difficulties, and wait for the higher authorities to solve problems. Some cadres said: "I haven't learned basic construction yet, I don't know how to do it, let me study for half a year and then come back." Therefore, the bureau's basic construction preparation work is very slow. For example, the construction project of the geological school has not yet found a site, and only 3 million bricks have been ordered by the original school construction committee, and no one is specifically responsible.

With the help of the Ministry of Heavy Industry's inspection team, the leading cadres of the bureau have initially reversed the idea of not paying attention to basic construction, and have given reports to all staff members, criticizing the passive waiting mentality. At the same time, the inspection work of basic construction has been re-arranged, and three more teams have been added to inspect Shuikoushan and other places.

    中南有色金属工业管理局
    扭转基本建设准备工作中的消极等待思想
    中南有色金属工业管理局基本建设准备工作做得很差，经重工业部检查组的帮助，情况已开始好转。
    中南有色金属工业管理局今年的基本建设任务虽然相当繁重，但该局领导干部一直却未重视这项工作，该局曾组织了十个检查小组共九十余人到各矿检查工作，其中七个检查小组有六十多人专门检查生产，只有三个小组检查基本建设，其中一个小组还要兼顾检查生产。到目前为止，该局基本建设处编制有三个处长才到一个，十个科还缺五个科长，工程公司的经理也还未配备。有一些领导干部对完成一九五三年的基本建设任务没有信心，专讲困难，坐等上级来解决问题。有的干部说：“基本建设我还没学会，不会干，让我去学习半年再来。”因此，该局基本建设准备工作非常迟缓。如地质学校修建工程到现在还未找到地皮，仅由原来的建校委员会订购了三百万块砖，也没有专人负责。
    在重工业部检查组的帮助下，该局领导干部初步扭转了不重视基本建设的思想，向全体工作人员作了报告，批判了消极等待思想。同时重新布置了基本建设的检查工作，又增加了三个小组到水口山等地去检查。
