Everyone Should Study "A Concise Biography of Stalin"
Fan Ruoyu

(I)

The great Stalin has unfortunately passed away. Each of us should resolve to respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "intensify the study of Stalin's doctrines" ("The Greatest Friendship").

However, Stalin's doctrines are so rich and profound, how should we study them in a planned way, and where should we begin?

As early as 1939, Chairman Mao taught us in his speech at the Yan'an gathering celebrating Stalin's sixtieth birthday: "We must study him in two aspects, one is the aspect of principle, and the other is the aspect of undertaking." "A Concise Biography of Stalin," published by the Soviet National Political Book Publishing House, is precisely an introductory book that guides us to study Stalin's aspects of principle and undertaking.

As everyone knows, Marx and Engels were the leaders and theorists of the working class preparing for a revolutionary assault on capitalism, and Lenin and Stalin were the leaders and theorists of the working class directly assaulting capitalism and building socialism. After the victory of the October Revolution, as "A Concise Biography of Stalin" says: "The Great October Socialist Revolution fundamentally changed the situation. It divided the world into two systems: one is the capitalist system, and the other is the socialist system. Under the new conditions, the Bolshevik Party must solve new great tasks." Lenin and Stalin at that time were the undertakers who solved the new great tasks under these new conditions. After Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin inherited Lenin's cause, and based on the experience of the Russian and worldwide communist movement, and based on the experience of the October Socialist Revolution and the subsequent socialist society construction, he "comprehensively and epoch-makingly developed the theory of Marxism-Leninism and advanced the development of Marxism to a new stage." (Chairman Mao: "The Greatest Friendship") Therefore, Stalin's doctrines are of great creativity. From "A Concise Biography of Stalin," we can see how Stalin developed and enriched the theory of Marxism-Leninism with great creativity.

All of Stalin's new and significant contributions in theory not only guided the Soviet people to build socialism and are moving towards communism, but also guide the working people of the world to struggle for the same goal. His theory on party building is forever the organizational principle of communist parties in all countries; his theory on Marxist philosophy, his theory on the general crisis of the capitalist system, and his theory on the basic economic laws of modern capitalism and socialism are forever powerful weapons for progressive humanity to observe history, economy, politics, culture, international affairs, and human destiny. His theory on the possibility of socialism achieving victory first in one country, his theory on the transition from capitalism to socialism, and his theory on building communism in the Soviet Union are forever pointers for people of all countries in the historical process. His revolutionary theory on colonies and semi-colonies is guiding the liberation struggle of the oppressed nations of the world towards victory. All of his theories are the material force of the worldwide communist movement. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, in the past, drew strength from Stalin's revolutionary theory and found the path to revolutionary victory; in the future, we need to draw strength from his theory to move towards new victories. Currently, it is especially urgent to draw strength from his theory on transforming an agricultural country into an industrial country to build our country.

"A Concise Biography of Stalin" vividly and concretely introduces the basic contents of Stalin's theory in a concise and succinct manner. When introducing these theories, "A Concise Biography of Stalin" also narrates the new conditions under which Stalin put forward these theoretical problems and the effects they produced. In this way, we can clearly see how Stalin turned theory into undertaking, and how his undertaking proved his theory. In "A Concise Biography of Stalin," many of Stalin's typical works, such as "Concerning the Differences of Opinion in the Party," "Anarchism or Socialism?", "Marxism and the National Question," "Foundations of Leninism," "Problems of Leninism," "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union," and Stalin's reports at the various congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are introduced in relatively detailed manner. These typical works of Stalin, as well as his later works "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics" and "Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R.," are must-read works for people all over the world who study Marxism-Leninism. As "A Concise Biography of Stalin" says: "Millions of workers in various countries of the world recognize Stalin as their teacher because they have learned from Stalin's typical works in the past and present how to defeat class enemies and how to prepare the conditions for the final victory of the proletariat." In order to study Stalin's typical works, it is very necessary to first read "A Concise Biography of Stalin" carefully. From "A Concise Biography of Stalin," we can obtain a clue to study Stalin's doctrines and lay a foundation for reading Stalin's works.

(II)

"A Concise Biography of Stalin" also provides a summary account of Stalin's great practical activities. From this book, we see that Stalin, together with Lenin, founded the Bolshevik Party, led the Great October Socialist Revolution, and created the world's first socialist country.

After Lenin's death, Stalin was a faithful successor to Lenin's cause. Not long after Lenin's death, he led the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people in the construction of national industrialization and stipulated the task of agricultural collectivization. When the first Stalin Five-Year Plan was completed, the Soviet Union leaped from a backward agricultural country to an advanced industrial country. When the second Stalin Five-Year Plan was completed, the policy of comprehensive agricultural collectivization achieved great victory. In this way, the doctrine that socialism can be built in one country was victorious.

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, under Stalin's leadership, the Soviet people, especially the working class, cultivated their own intellectual talents, thereby solving the cadre problem of socialist construction. At the same time, Stalin, relying on the masses, launched a powerful Stakhanov movement. "This movement opens the road to communism." After the socialist transformation of the entire national economy of the Soviet Union and the fundamental change in domestic class relations, under Stalin's auspices, the "Stalin Constitution" was formulated. This constitution "is a constitution of the victory of socialism and the broad expansion of socialist democracy, which has transformed the ideals of outstanding thinkers of mankind into fixed laws." "This constitution is a summary of the struggle and victory for the Soviet laborers, and for the laborers in capitalist countries, it is a great struggle program."

Just as the Soviet people were carrying out the Third Stalin Five-Year Plan, the peaceful labor of the Soviet people was interrupted due to the invasion of the Soviet Union by the German fascist beasts. However, the socialist system produced by the October Revolution is unbreakable. Under Stalin's leadership, the heroic Soviet Red Army finally "raised the banner of victory over the city of Berlin." Subsequently, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. Under the attack of the heroic Soviet Red Army, the Japanese invaders, although they carried out several unusually fierce but ineffective resistance, finally had to surrender unconditionally.

Stalin's undertaking is an undertaking to save the fate of mankind. After Lenin's death, the socialist construction of the Soviet Union led by Stalin not only allowed the Soviet people to first enjoy a good socialist life, but also educated the working people of the world with this good reality, making the Soviet Union the most advanced example for the working people of the world. More than a hundred years ago, Marx and Engels could only use their co-authored "Communist Manifesto" to confront those who mythologized communism as a "specter" at that time. After the victory of the October Revolution, especially after the victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, Stalin used the real life of the Soviet Union to prove that communism is not a myth, but an inevitable fact. The victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union vividly proved that when classes are eliminated, people work with their own hands for their own happy life, and will unleash enormous power. People are working selflessly, labor productivity is constantly increasing, and people's material and cultural affluence is rising day by day. In this way, the working people of the world are more firmly determined to take their only road, the road of the Soviet people, the road to strive for and realize socialism and communism. Inspired and helped by Stalin's cause, socialism has now been put on the agenda of all mankind. Especially in the Second World War, Stalin led the Soviet Union and the people of the world to defeat the German, Japanese, and Italian fascist beasts, thus producing many people's democratic countries in Europe and promoting the rapid victory of the Chinese revolution, changing the situation in the world. This new situation in the world is precisely what Chairman Mao said: "That is, the cause of justice, people's democracy, and socialism has achieved victory on a large scale in the world, in an area of the earth with more than one-third of the population - more than 800 million people, and the impact of this victory is increasingly spreading to every corner of the world." ("The Greatest Friendship") Stalin is the creator of this new situation in the world and the liberator of mankind.

"A Concise Biography of Stalin" inspires us to correctly understand Stalin's cause. "Comrade Stalin's life and career are closely linked with the career of his teacher and educator Lenin, with the history of our heroic Bolshevik Party, and with the history of the great Soviet people." Therefore, our study of Stalin's cause is naturally also closely linked with the study of Lenin's cause, the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the history of the Soviet people. The purpose of this study, as stated in "A Concise Biography of Stalin," is to make us understand that: "What has been achieved in the Soviet Union can also be achieved in other countries."

"A Concise Biography of Stalin" also points out: "Comrade Stalin's life and career are connected with the international workers' movement and the anti-imperialist national liberation struggle of the colonial people." This is something that the Chinese people have a deeper understanding of. As Chairman Mao said: "People know that Comrade Stalin loves the Chinese people and believes that the power of the Chinese revolution is inestimable. He devoted his lofty wisdom to the Chinese revolution. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, following the doctrines of Lenin and Stalin, have received the support of the great Soviet state and all revolutionary forces in various countries, and have achieved historical victory a few years ago." ("The Greatest Friendship")

(III)

To study Stalin's cause, we must also study the revolutionary qualities and style that are inseparable from his cause. In this regard, "A Concise Biography of Stalin" also provides us with a lot of learning materials.

Stalin, he was Lenin's most loyal student and comrade-in-arms. He has always followed Lenin's path forward. He has had an iron will for Lenin's cause, the proletarian revolution and the cause of communism worldwide, since he became a revolutionary at the age of fifteen. From "A Concise Biography of Stalin," we see that in the long years before the October Revolution, Stalin was constantly subjected to persecution by the Tsar. He was arrested seven times and exiled six times. However, Lenin's cause, the cause of communism, attracted him like a magnet. Therefore, he finally escaped from the exile place to his fighting post again and again.

Stalin, he is the party's genius leader, the great strategist of the socialist revolution, the leader and wise commander of the Soviet state, and the revolutionary teacher of the working people of the world. The best way to explain why he was able to become such a person is to explain it in his own words: "Only a leader who is not only good at teaching workers and peasants but also good at learning from workers and peasants can be a true Bolshevik leader." From "A Concise Biography of Stalin," we see that he has profoundly trusted the people since he first began his revolutionary activities, becoming the best example of contact with the masses. As "A Concise Biography of Stalin" says: "Stalin is more skilled than anyone else in synthesizing the revolutionary creative experience of the masses, responding to and developing the pioneering spirit of the masses, learning from the masses and teaching the masses, and guiding the masses to victory."

Stalin, he is a person who is unrelenting to the enemies of the people. He taught people "to oppose and defeat enemies at home and abroad as Ilich did." From "A Concise Biography of Stalin," we see that Stalin's experience is also the experience of leading the party and the people to defeat various domestic and foreign enemies at various times. He is good at seeing through the various conspiracies and tricks of the enemy, and he is good at using all the strength of the people to attack the enemy. In 1918, when Lenin informed Stalin in Sharitsyn of the rebellion of the "Left" Social Revolutionaries, he replied: "As for the crazy elements, please rest assured that our hands will not tremble. We will treat the enemy with the means to deal with the enemy." ("Concise History of Lenin's Life and Career") Under the education of Stalin's revolutionary spirit, the Soviet people are also "never allowed to have an indifferent, complacent, or fearful attitude to struggle, and there should be no room for discouragement, panic, or desertion"; "and those who dare to invade our country will always encounter a fatal blow, so that they will never dare to extend their pig mouths into our Soviet vegetable garden," Stalin warned.

Stalin, he is a person with a very profound principle spirit and an irreconcilable attitude towards opportunism. In "A Concise Biography of Stalin," we see that he and Lenin thoroughly implemented the party's line, defended the party's line, and smashed all the anti-party enemies. He organizationally led the struggle against various anti-Lenin groups and united the party around the Lenin program. His writings are a model for consistently defending the Marxist-Leninist position. Its characteristic is that it often strikes at opportunism with profound theory. He pointed out: "Leninism was produced, grew, and strengthened in a relentless struggle against various opportunisms; the Bolshevik organization is the only revolutionary organization in the world that has completely defeated opportunists and centrists and expelled them from the party."

Regarding the characteristics of Stalin's noble qualities and his work style, what we see in "A Concise Biography of Stalin" is not limited to this. "A Concise Biography of Stalin" points out: "Everyone knows that Stalin's logical power is invincible and indestructible; his mind is as clear as crystal, his will is as strong as steel, he is infinitely loyal to the party, deeply trusts the people, and warmly cares for them. Everyone knows that Stalin is humble and frank, considerate to people, and unrelenting to the enemies of the people. Everyone knows that Stalin is fundamentally opposed to exaggeration, empty talk, empty talk, retreating in the face of difficulties, and panicking in the face of things. Whenever Stalin encounters complex political problems that require careful assessment of the pros and cons, he is always wise and calm, and not impatient. At the same time, Stalin is also an expert in planning bold revolutionary methods and implementing rapid transformation steps." "Relentless to the enemies of socialism; extremely profound principle spirit; in work, there is both a clear revolutionary future and purpose, and a strong will to never stop until the goal is achieved; wise and concrete leadership; inseparable connection with the masses, - this is the characteristic of Stalin's work style."

"A Concise Biography of Stalin" narrates Stalin's life and career until February 1946. Stalin's theoretical and practical activities in the seven years since then cannot be seen in this book. However, this book is of great help to us in studying Stalin's doctrines and his cause. A book that correctly narrates the story of an immortal person in the most concise language should also be immortal.

When reading this "A Concise Biography of Stalin" after the sudden death of Comrade Stalin, our hearts are infinitely sad. However, it is also at this time of infinite sadness that learning Stalin's doctrines gives us infinite strength. The Chinese people, who have experienced suffering, gone through hardships, and struggled from difficulties, know that the strength transformed from grief is extraordinary strength. The strength Stalin left us is forever infinite.

    人人都应学习“斯大林传略”
    范若愚
        （一）
    伟大的斯大林不幸与世长辞了。我们每个人都应该下定决心，响应毛主席的伟大号召，“加紧学习斯大林的学说”（“最伟大的友谊”）。
    但是，斯大林的学说是如此丰富和精深，我们该将怎样有计划地进行学习，并从那里学起呢？
    早在一九三九年，毛主席在延安各界庆祝斯大林六十寿辰大会上的讲话里教导我们：“我们要学习他的两个方面，一个是道理方面，一个是事业方面。”苏联国立政治书籍出版局出版的“斯大林传略”，正是一本指引我们学习斯大林的道理方面和事业方面的入门书籍。
    大家知道，马克思和恩格斯是工人阶级准备向资本主义作革命突击时期的领袖和理论家，列宁和斯大林是工人阶级直接向资本主义突击并建设社会主义时期的领袖和理论家。在十月革命胜利之后，正如“斯大林传略”中所说：“伟大十月社会主义革命，使局势根本改变了。它把全世界分成了两个体系：一个是资本主义体系，另一个是社会主义体系。在新的条件下，布尔什维克党必须解决新的伟大任务。”当时的列宁、斯大林就是在这种新的条件下，解决新的伟大任务的担当者。一九二四年列宁逝世以后，斯大林继承了列宁的事业，他以俄国及全世界共产主义运动的经验为基础，以十月社会主义革命和以后社会主义社会建设的经验为基础，“全面地划时代地发展了马克思列宁主义的理论，把马克思主义的发展推进到新的阶段。”（毛主席：“最伟大的友谊”）因此，斯大林的学说是具有巨大的创造性的。从“斯大林传略”里，我们可以看到，斯大林以伟大的创造性发展与丰富了马克思列宁主义的理论。
    斯大林在理论方面的一切新的巨大贡献，不仅指导苏联人民建设成了社会主义并正走向共产主义，而且也指导着全世界的劳动人民为达到同样的目的而斗争。他的关于党的建设的理论，永远是各国共产主义政党的组织原则；他的关于马克思主义哲学的理论、关于资本主义体系总危机的理论、关于现代资本主义和社会主义的基本经济法则的理论，永远是进步人类用以观察历史、经济、政治、文化、国际事务以及人类命运的有力武器。他的关于社会主义可能在一个国家首先胜利的理论、从资本主义过渡到社会主义的理论以及在苏联建设共产主义的理论，永远是各国人民在历史进程中的指针。他的关于殖民地半殖民地的革命理论，正指导着全世界被压迫的民族的解放斗争走向胜利。他的一切理论，都是全世界共产主义运动的物质力量。中国共产党和中国人民，过去就是从斯大林的革命理论中吸取了力量，找到了革命胜利的途径；今后更需要从他的理论中吸取力量，走向新的胜利。目前，尤其迫切需要的是从他的关于变农业国为工业国的理论中，吸取力量，来建设我们的国家。
        “斯大林传略”生动地、具体地把斯大林理论的基本内容作了简明扼要的介绍。“斯大林传略”在介绍这些理论时，并叙述了斯大林提出这些理论问题的新条件及其所产生的作用。这样，就使我们清楚地看到，斯大林怎样把理论化成了事业，而他的事业又如何证实了他的理论。在“斯大林传略”中，对于斯大林的许多典型著作，如“略论党内的意见分歧”、“无政府主义还是社会主义？”、“马克思主义与民族问题”、“论列宁主义基础”、“论列宁主义底几个问题”、“苏联共产党历史”以及斯大林在苏联共产党的历次代表大会上所作的报告，都作了比较详细的介绍。斯大林的这些典型著作，以及后来著的“马克思主义与语言学问题”、“苏联社会主义经济问题”，乃是全世界学习马克思列宁主义的人所必读的著作。正如“斯大林传略”中所说的：“世界各国数千百万工人，认定斯大林是他们的导师，因为他们过去和现在，都从斯大林底典型著作中学习怎样战胜阶级敌人，学习怎样准备无产阶级最终胜利的条件。”为了学习斯大林的典型著作，首先认真地读一下“斯大林传略”，是很必要的。从“斯大林传略”里，可以获得学习斯大林学说的一条线索，可以为阅读斯大林的著作打下一个基础。
            （二）
    “斯大林传略”对于斯大林的巨大实际活动，也作了概括的叙述。从这本书里，我们看到，斯大林和列宁一起，创立了布尔什维克党，领导了伟大的十月社会主义革命，并缔造了世界上第一个社会主义的国家。
    在列宁逝世之后，斯大林是列宁事业的忠实继承者。还在列宁逝世不久，他就领导着苏联共产党和苏联人民进行了国家工业化的建设，并规定了农业集体化的任务。当第一个斯大林五年计划完成之后，苏联即由落后的农业国一跃而为先进的工业国。当第二个斯大林五年计划完成的时候，全盘农业集体化的政策又获得了巨大的胜利。这样，社会主义可能在一个国家内建成的学说胜利了。
    在第二个五年计划时期，在斯大林领导下，苏联人民特别是工人阶级造就了自己的知识人材，从而解决了社会主义建设的干部问题。同时，斯大林凭藉着群众，掀起了强大的斯塔哈诺夫运动。“这个运动开辟着走向共产主义的道路”。在苏联全部国民经济经过社会主义的改造，国内阶级关系根本改变之后，在斯大林的主持下，又制定了“斯大林宪法”。这个宪法“是社会主义获得胜利、社会主义民主制广泛扩展的宪法，它把人类先进优秀思想家历来的理想变成了固定不移的法规”。“这个宪法对于苏联劳动者说来是斗争和胜利底总结，而对于资本主义各国劳动者说来，则是伟大的斗争纲领”。
    正当苏联人民进行第三个斯大林五年计划的时候，由于德国法西斯野兽侵犯苏联，苏联人民的和平劳动就被打断了。但是，由十月革命所产生的社会主义制度，乃是牢不可破的。在斯大林的领导下，英勇的苏联红军，终于“在柏林城上树起胜利的旗帜”。接着，苏联宣布了对日战争。日寇在英勇的苏联红军打击之下，虽然进行了几次异常猛烈但毫无成效的反抗，但终于不得不无条件投降。
    斯大林的事业，是拯救人类命运的事业。列宁逝世后，斯大林所领导的苏联社会主义建设，不仅使苏联人民首先享受到美好的社会主义生活，而且用这个美好的现实生活，教育了全世界劳动人民，使苏联成为全世界劳动人民最先进的榜样。一百多年前，马克思和恩格斯还只能用他们合著的“共产党宣言”，去对抗那些当时把共产主义当作“怪影”神话的人。十月革命胜利后，特别是苏联社会主义建设胜利后，斯大林就用苏联的现实生活，证明了共产主义并非神话，而是必然的事实。苏联社会主义建设的胜利，生动地证明了当阶级消灭之后，人民用自己的双手为自己的幸福生活而工作，就会发挥出巨大无比的力量。人们忘我地劳动着，劳动生产率不断地提高着，人民在物质方面和文化方面的富足生活日益地上升着。这样，就使全世界劳动人民更加坚定不移地要走他们唯一的道路，——走苏联人民的道路，走争取与实现社会主义和共产主义的道路。在斯大林事业的鼓舞和帮助下，社会主义现在已被提到全人类的议事日程上来了。尤其是在第二次世界大战中，斯大林领导苏联和全世界人民战胜了德、日、意法西斯野兽，因而产生了欧洲许多人民民主国家，并促进了中国革命的迅速胜利，改变了全世界的局面。这个世界的新局面，正是毛主席所说的：“这即是正义的、人民民主的和社会主义的事业在世界大规模的范围内，在地球上人口三分之一——八万万人以上的范围内取得了胜利，而且这种胜利的影响，正日益普及到全世界的每一个角落。”（“最伟大的友谊”）斯大林是这个全世界新局面的创造者，是人类的解放者。
    “斯大林传略”启示我们应该怎样正确地去认识斯大林的事业。“斯大林同志底生平事业，是与其导师和教养者列宁底事业，与我们英勇布尔什维克党底历史，与伟大苏联人民底历史密切相连的。”因此，我们学习斯大林的事业，自然也是与学习列宁的事业、苏联共产党的历史、以及苏联人民的历史密切相连的。这个学习的目的，正如“斯大林传略”中所说的，就在于使我们懂得：“凡在苏联已经实现的东西，是在其他各国也可能实现的”。
    “斯大林传略”中也指出：“斯大林同志底生平事业，实与国际工人运动以及各殖民地人民反帝民族解放斗争相连接”。这对于中国人民来说，是体会更深的。正如毛主席所说：“人们都知道：斯大林同志热爱中国人民，认为中国革命的力量是不可估量的。在中国革命问题上，他献出了崇高的智慧。中国共产党和中国人民正是遵循列宁斯大林的学说，得到了伟大的苏维埃国家和各国一切革命力量的支持，而在几年以前获得了历史性的胜利。”（“最伟大的友谊”）
        （三）
    学习斯大林的事业，也必须学习与他的事业不可分的革命品质和作风。在这方面，“斯大林传略”也给我们提供了不少的学习材料。
    斯大林，他是列宁的最忠实的学生与战友。他一直遵循着列宁的道路而前进。他对于列宁的事业，即无产阶级革命与全世界共产主义的事业，从十五岁就成为革命家的那时候起，就具有钢铁般的意志。从“斯大林传略”里，我们看到，在十月革命前的悠久年月里，斯大林曾不断地遭受着沙皇的迫害。他曾先后被捕七次，流放六次。可是，列宁的事业，共产主义的事业，像磁一样地吸引着他。因此，他终于一次又一次地由流放地方逃回到自己的战斗岗位上。
    斯大林，他是党的天才领袖，是社会主义革命的伟大战略家，是苏维埃国家领导者和英明统帅，是全世界劳动人民的革命导师。他之所以能够成为这样的人，最好还是从他自己所说的话里来解释：“只有不仅善于教导工农，而且还善于向工农学习的领导者，才能是真正的布尔什维克的领导者。”从“斯大林传略”里，我们看到，他自己从最初开始革命活动时起，就对人民深刻信任，成为同群众联系的最好的榜样了。正如“斯大林传略”中所说的：“斯大林比谁都更巧于综合群众底革命创造经验，响应并发挥群众底首创精神，向群众学习并教导群众，引导群众向胜利前进。”
    斯大林，他是一个对人民公敌毫不留情的人。他教导人“要照依里奇那样去反对，去战胜国内国外的敌人”。从“斯大林传略”里，我们看到斯大林的经历，也就是在各种不同时期，领导党和人民战胜各种不同的国内外敌人的经历。他善于识破敌人的各种阴谋伎俩，他善于用人民的一切力量去冲击敌人。一九一八年，斯大林在沙丽城，当列宁把“左派”社会革命党人叛乱的消息通知他时，他回答道：“至于说到疯狂的分子，那就请你放心，我们的手是不会颤抖的。对于敌人，我们是会用对付仇敌的手段去对付的。”（“列宁生平事业简史”）在斯大林这种革命精神教养下的苏联人民，无论任何时候，也是“决不容有漠不关心、泰然自若、害怕斗争的情绪，决不应有灰心丧气、张皇失措和临阵脱逃者立足的余地”的；“而那些擅敢侵犯我国的人，——斯大林警告说——却总会遇到致命的回击，使得他们以后再也不敢把自己的猪嘴，伸到我们苏维埃的菜园子里来。”
    斯大林，他是个具有极深刻的原则精神，对机会主义采取毫不调和的态度的人。在“斯大林传略”里，我们看到：他和列宁一起彻底实行了党的路线，捍卫了党的路线，击碎了所有一切反党的敌人。他在组织上领导了反对各个反列宁集团的斗争，而把党团结到列宁政纲的周围。他的著作，是一贯捍卫马克思列宁主义立场的模范。其特色就是以深刻的理论，常常一针见血地打击着机会主义。他指明说：“列宁主义是在同各种机会主义作无情斗争中产生、长成和强固起来的；布尔什维克组织，是世界上彻底击溃了机会主义者和中派主义者，并把他们逐出党外了的唯一革命组织。”
    关于斯大林的崇高品质及其工作作风的特点，我们在“斯大林传略”中所看到的，还不止此。“斯大林传略”中指出：“大家都知道，斯大林的逻辑力量是所向披靡，无坚不摧；他的头脑是如水晶般明亮，他的意志是如钢铁般坚强，他对党无限忠实，对人民深刻信任，热烈爱护。大家都知道，斯大林谦虚坦白，对人体贴入微，对人民公敌毫不留情。大家都知道，斯大林根本反对夸张，反对清谈，反对空话，反对见难而退，反对遇事张惶。斯大林每遇解决复杂政治问题，需要周密估计利弊所在的时候，总是明哲镇定，毫不急躁。同时，斯大林又是极其巧于规划大胆革命办法和实行急遽转变步骤的能手。”“对社会主义敌人毫不留情；极深刻的原则精神；在工作中，既有明确的革命前途和目的，又有非达到目的不止的坚强意志；贤明而具体的领导；同群众有不可分开的联系，——这就是斯大林工作作风底特点。”
    “斯大林传略”对斯大林的生平事业，叙述到一九四六年二月间而止。此后七年来斯大林的理论的、实际的巨大活动，在这本书里不能看到。可是，这本书对我们学习斯大林的学说及其事业是有很大帮助的。一本用最简练的文字正确地叙述了一个不朽的人的书，这书也应该是不朽的。
    在斯大林同志突然逝世之后来读这本“斯大林传略”，我们的心情是无限悲痛的。可是，也正是在这种无限悲痛的时候，来学习斯大林的学说，它所给予我们的力量也是无限的。饱经忧患、历尽艰难、从困苦中斗争过来的中国人民都知道：凡是由悲痛所化成的力量，乃是异乎寻常的力量。斯大林留给我们的力量，永远是无穷的。
