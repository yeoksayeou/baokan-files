Anhui Province, Hanshan County, Taiping Township Fails in Implementing the Marriage Law Due to Commandism

In the typical experiment of implementing the Marriage Law in Taiping Township, Hanshan County, Anhui Province, the work failed because of the adoption of crude, impetuous, and commandist methods, and the failure to conduct publicity and education among the masses, which caused fear and unease among the people.

The township's experimental work began in early January this year. From the beginning, the work team adopted the methods of social reforms such as the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, and erroneously put forward the slogan: "Those who violate the Marriage Law will be treated leniently if they confess, severely if they don't, and will be punished according to the law if they refuse to confess!" It was also stipulated that "cadres take the lead, everyone confesses, from top to bottom, complete confession," "first township cadres, then village cadres, and then expand to the masses for a comprehensive confession." Mass meetings were held by natural village, stipulating that all men and women over the age of eighteen must confess, even about their relationships and family life, and they were only allowed to talk about the bad things, not the good. A village cadre's wife in Yanshan natural village confessed at a mass meeting, saying, "My husband and I are fine, we haven't quarreled..." Before she could finish, she was stopped by the township instructor, who told her to confess the bad things. The woman thought for a long time and then said, "Once my husband came home late, and I didn't get up to open the door for a long time, so he got cold, and when I got into bed, I kicked him. That's my mistake, I'll correct it next time." The confession materials were recorded by the winter school teacher. Some bad elements took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying, "Those who violate the Marriage Law should confess quickly, or in March the government will arrest them like they arrested the evil landlords!" This caused fear and unease among many people. Some women were afraid to confess and ran away to other townships to hide, but they were found and brought back. Some people who had arranged marriages for their children in the past were so frightened that they cried at home all day and could not concentrate on production. At the same time, the cadres also recklessly promoted the idea that "women with a 'baba head' (untrimmed hair) have feudal brains." This scared many women into cutting their hair. Some elderly women were so ashamed after cutting their hair that they dared not see anyone. They said, "We never thought the Marriage Law would make us show our ugliness when we're old." During the work process, the work team did not conduct publicity among the masses, and the masses did not know what the purpose of implementing the Marriage Law was. Everyone was afraid of being labeled as "feudal" and actively tried to appear progressive on the surface. For example, women in the township did not have the habit of attending winter school, but during the movement to implement the Marriage Law, they urged their daughters or daughters-in-law to attend winter school, saying, "Go quickly, if you don't go, you'll be feudal again!" These chaotic phenomena did not arouse the work team's vigilance, but instead, they were complacent and considered them achievements in their work. Cao Jianying (deputy director of the county people's court), the leader of the township work team, also planned to convene a mass meeting of the entire township at the end of the movement, select eleven people for "typical confessions," and then mobilize the victims to accuse them. If the masses were not enlightened enough and dared not complain, cadres would be used instead. After the special commissioner's office winter repair work team reported to the county leaders, the county stopped them from holding a mass accusation meeting.

The reason for these chaotic phenomena is mainly because the township work team lacked serious research on the policies and did not understand that feudal marriage ideas among the masses could not be eliminated overnight with coercive methods, but as the Government Administration Council instructed, "requires long-term, meticulous, and patient work." Therefore, they adopted a crude, impetuous attitude and commandist methods. In particular, Cao Jianying, the leader of the township work team, had a strong sense of personal heroism. When the county instructed them to stop holding mass accusation meetings, he was greatly dissatisfied and complained at a meeting of township cadres, saying, "I won't be this team leader anymore, let the county head do it!" Under the influence of his erroneous thinking, the village cadres also followed suit and adopted coercive methods, which led to the failure of the experiment.

    安徽含山县太平乡在贯彻婚姻法中
    采用命令主义作法工作遭到失败
    安徽省含山县太平乡在贯彻婚姻法的典型试验中，由于采取粗暴急躁的命令主义作法，不向群众进行宣传教育，引起群众的恐惧和不安，使试验工作遭到失败。
    该乡试验工作在今年一月上旬开始。一开始工作组就采用“三反”、“五反”等社会改革的手段，错误地提出：“凡是违反婚姻法的，坦白从宽，不坦白从严，拒不坦白者依法惩办”的口号。并且规定“干部带头，个个交代，由上而下，彻底坦白”，“先乡干部，后村干部，再扩大到群众全面坦白”。并以自然村为单位召开群众会，规定十八岁以上的男女个个都要坦白，连男女关系和家庭生活上的问题都要谈，而且还只准谈坏的，不准谈好的。严山自然村一个村干部的老婆在群众大会上坦白说：“我们夫妇还好，没有争吵过……”还没说完，就被乡指导员制止了，要她坦白坏的。这女人想了很久才说：“有一次我丈夫回家晚了，敲了很久门我才起来，冻了他一下，上床我又踢了他一脚，这是我的错误，下次改正。”坦白的材料都由冬学教师记下来。有些坏分子趁机造谣说：“违反婚姻法的赶快坦白，不然到三月里政府就要像逮捕恶霸地主一样把他捉起来！”这样引起许多群众的恐惧和不安。有的妇女害怕坦白，跑到外乡躲避，又被找了回来。有些过去曾经包办过儿女婚姻的，吓得整天在家哭，不能安心生产。同时干部也胡乱宣传说：“妇女巴巴头（没剪发），就是封建脑瓜。”吓得许多妇女都把头发剪了。有的老年妇女剪了以后，羞得不敢见人，她们说：“想不到婚姻法叫我们临老了还来现丑。”在工作过程中，工作组没有向群众进行宣传，群众也不知道贯彻婚姻法的目的是什么。大家为了怕戴“封建”帽子，都在表面上积极表现进步。如该乡妇女本来没有上冬学的习惯，在贯彻婚姻法运动中，都催着自己的女儿或媳妇上冬学，还说：“快去呀，不去又是封建哪！”这些混乱现象，不但没有引起工作组的警惕，反而认为这是工作中的成绩而沾沾自喜。该乡工作组组长曹建英（县人民法院副院长）还计划在运动结束时，召开全乡群众大会，选择十一个人作“典型坦白”，然后发动受害人控诉；如果群众觉悟不高，不敢诉苦，就以干部代替；诉苦后当场逮捕三个，处理八个。经专署冬修工作组给县领导干部反映后，县上才制止了他们召开群众控诉大会。
    造成这些混乱现象的原因，主要是由于该乡工作组对政策缺乏认真的研究，不明白群众中的封建婚姻思想，不是一朝一夕用强制的办法可以消除的，而是如政务院所指示的，“需要有长期的、细致的、耐心的工作”，因此采取了粗暴急躁的态度和命令主义的方法。特别是该乡工作组组长曹建英，个人英雄主义十分浓厚，县上指示他们停止召开群众控诉会时，还大为不满地在乡干部会上发牢骚说：“我这个组长不当了，让县长来干吧！”在他的这种错误思想影响下，乡村干部也跟着采用强迫命令作法，致使试验工作遭到失败。
