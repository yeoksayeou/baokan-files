Xinhua News Agency, Moscow. *Pravda* recently published an article by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, on economic cooperation among countries in the democratic camp.

    Gheorghiu-Dej first spoke of the vigorous and steady development of the peaceful economies of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and detailed the tremendous changes that have taken place in the Romanian economy in recent years. He pointed out that Romania has created the conditions to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years. Now, Romania's national income has increased by 68.7 percent compared to 1949, of which more than 50 percent comes from the republic's industry. Of all industrial products, means of production account for 57.4 percent.

    Gheorghiu-Dej went on to say that foreign trade among countries in the socialist camp is the basic mode of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Despite the imperialist countries' policy of blockade, foreign trade between the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies is still expanding rapidly. For example, between 1948 and 1952, although trade with capitalist countries was reduced, foreign trade between countries in the socialist camp still doubled. From 1946 to 1952, the total amount of foreign trade of the five European People's Democracies—Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria—almost increased six and a half times.

    Gheorghiu-Dej analyzed the long-term trade agreements between Romania and the countries in the democratic camp. He said that according to the long-term trade agreement between the Soviet Union and Romania from 1951 to 1955, Romania can obtain equipment, machines, complete sets of machines needed for the machine manufacturing industry, highly precise machine tools, powerful excavators for excavating the Danube-Black Sea Canal, motor vehicles, turbines needed for the huge power stations being built according to the ten-year electrification plan, oil refining equipment, tractors and combine harvesters, heavy machinery for the chemical industry, raw materials, and many other materials. According to the Romanian-Czechoslovakian treaty, Romania exports oil products, timber, grain, meat, and other items to Czechoslovakia, and imports metallurgical and chemical industrial products, agricultural machinery, transportation equipment, and other industrial products from Czechoslovakia. Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out that these trades will have a positive impact on the development of Romania and the entire economies of these countries.

    Gheorghiu-Dej concluded by writing that the Romanian people know that friendship and fraternal alliance with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies are the guarantee of their independence and autonomy, and the guarantee of their interests and happy future. For their free and creative new life, for their bright future, they love and are grateful to the Soviet people and Comrade Stalin, the liberator of all nationalities and the banner of international peace and friendship.

    乔治乌—德治论民主阵营国家间经济合作
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报最近刊载了罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会总书记乔治乌—德治论民主阵营国家间经济合作的一篇文章。
    乔治乌—德治首先谈到了苏联和人民民主国家和平经济的蓬勃的稳步的发展，并详述了最近几年来罗马尼亚经济中发生的巨大变化。他指出：罗马尼亚已创造了在四年中完成五年计划的条件。现在，罗马尼亚的国民收入已比一九四九年增加了百分之六十八点七，其中有百分之五十以上来自共和国的工业。在全部工业产品中，生产资料已占百分之五十七点四。
    乔治乌—德治接着说：社会主义阵营国家间的对外贸易，是苏联和人民民主国家经济合作的基本方式。尽管帝国主义国家实行封锁政策，苏联和人民民主国家的对外贸易仍在迅速扩大。例如，在一九四八年到一九五二年间，虽然对资本主义国家的贸易削减了，但是，社会主义阵营国家的对外贸易仍然增加了一倍。从一九四六年到一九五二年间，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和保加利亚这五个欧洲人民民主国家的对外贸易总额几乎增加了六倍半。
    乔治乌—德治分析了罗马尼亚与民主阵营国家间的长期贸易协定，他说：根据苏联和罗马尼亚一九五一年——一九五五年的长期贸易协定，罗马尼亚可以得到设备，机器，机器制造业所需用的整套机器，高度精确的工作母机，开凿多瑙河—黑海运河用的效力强大的挖掘机，摩托车辆和根据十年电气化计划正在建筑的巨大电力站所需用的透平，炼油设备，拖拉机和联合收割机，化学工业用的重型机器，原料以及其他许多物资。根据罗捷条约，罗马尼亚向捷克斯洛伐克输出石油产品、木材、谷物、肉类以及其他物品，并从捷克斯洛伐克输入冶金和化学工业产品、农业机器、交通设备以及其他工业品。乔治乌—德治指出：这些贸易对于罗马尼亚和这些国家的整个经济的发展，将产生良好的影响。
    乔治乌—德治最后写道，罗马尼亚人民知道，与苏联和人民民主国家的友谊和兄弟般的联盟，是他们的独立和自主的保证，是他们的利益、幸福前途的保证。为了他们的自由的创造性的新生活，为了他们光辉的未来，他们爱戴并感激苏联人民和各族人民的解放者、国际和平和友谊的旗手斯大林同志。
