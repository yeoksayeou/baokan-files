Shandong Electric Factory
Seriously Neglects Product Quality

The product quality of Shandong Electric Factory is low, often resulting in a large amount of rework or scrapping, causing alarming waste, and there has been no improvement for a long time.

In mid-November last year, the factory conducted a major quality inspection, revealing 175 instances of rework and waste in five months, more than 16,000 defective products, and a waste of 8,183 work hours. However, this inspection did not attract the slightest attention from the factory's leading cadres, and the phenomenon of rework and waste continued to develop. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2,700 products were reworked in December last year. As a result, the factory's production tasks for last year were delayed by a month, causing huge losses to national assets and the important capital construction projects of ordering units.

In this factory, no one can be said to be responsible for product quality. For a certain type of DC generator, the original regulation stipulated that a withstand voltage test of 1,500 volts was合格 [qualified], but when the buyer requested a test of 2,000 volts, the cadres in charge of the testing department did not consider the insulation level of their finished products and agreed. During the test, the testing personnel discovered that the first few units had been punctured by the voltage, but continued the test as before, and no one stopped them. As a result, all 30 armatures were punctured. Afterwards, the leading cadres of the testing department neither investigated nor attempted to deal with such a serious matter. When manufacturing armature coils for a certain type of generator, the workshop leaders did not carefully check whether the molds were usable, but simply said "it's okay" and started production. After rework three times during the manufacturing process, there was still no alert, and only after completing all 250 generators was it discovered that they could not be used. The waste of enameled copper wire alone amounted to 150 kilograms, equivalent to approximately 13.95 million yuan in old currency. The drawings designed by the factory's technical department lack strict review procedures, and rework events caused by errors occur frequently and cannot be statistically counted. A certain type of generator had been reworked once due to drawing errors, but recently it was discovered that there were several more errors in the drawings, and 250 generators had to be reworked a second time. The inspectors specifically responsible for checking product quality perform their work perfunctorily, and do not inspect semi-finished products or parts in progress. In addition, there is also a lot of rework and waste caused by poor coordination between various processes and operational technical problems. The factory's leading cadres sit in their offices all day busy with affairs, without delving into the workshops to solve problems, only focusing on production without regard for conservation, pursuing quantity without seeking quality.

### 山东电器厂  严重忽视产品质量

    山东电器厂
    严重忽视产品质量
    山东电器厂产品质量低劣，经常大量地返工或作废，浪费惊人，而且长期没有改进。
    该厂在去年十一月中旬曾进行过一次质量大检查，揭发出五个月当中返工浪费现象有一百七十五条，废品一万六千多件，浪费八千一百八十三个工时。但是这次检查并未引起该厂领导干部的丝毫注意，返工浪费现象仍旧继续发展。据不完全的统计，去年十二月份返工产品达两千七百多件。因此，该厂去年的生产任务拖了一个月才完成，给国家资财和订货单位的重要基本建设工程造成了巨大损失。
    在这个工厂里，产品质量可以说是没有人负责的。有一种直流发电机，原规定耐压试验一千五百伏特为合格，但当买主要求试二千伏特时，领导试验部的干部也不考虑自己出的成品是按多大的绝缘制造的，就答应了。在试验时，试验人员发觉前几部已被电压打穿，还照旧试验下去，也没有人制止他。结果三十部动子全被打穿了。事后，试验部的领导干部对这样一件严重的事情，既不去了解，也不想法处理。制造某种发电机动子线包时，车间领导人员没有详细检查模子是否能用，只说了一句“行”就动手生产。在制造过程中返工三次，仍然没有引起警惕，第四次把二百五十部发电机全部做完了，才发现不能用，仅元纱漆包铜线就浪费了一百五十公斤，约合人民币一千三百九十五万元。该厂技术室设计的图纸，没有严格的审查手续，经常发生错误，造成产品返工的事件无法统计。有一种发电机，因为图纸错误，曾经返过工，但是最近又发觉图纸上有好几处错误，二百五十部发电机又要第二次返工。专门负责检查产品质量的检查员，工作敷衍了事，半成品和在制品的零件都不检查。此外，因为各个工序间联系不密切和操作技术上有问题而造成的返工浪费也很多。该厂的领导干部，整天坐在办公室忙于事务，不深入车间解决问题，只管生产不管节约，追求数量不求质量。
