Telegram of Condolence from the Jilin Provincial Federation of Trade Unions to the Central Council of Trade Unions of Czechoslovakia:

    Upon hearing the news of the unfortunate passing of Comrade Klement Gottwald, President of the Czechoslovak Republic, Chairman of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, outstanding activist of the international workers' movement, and a sincere friend of the Chinese people, the workers of Jilin Province, China, feel deep sorrow. The passing of Comrade Gottwald is a great loss to the Czechoslovak working class and all working people, as well as a great loss to the working class of the world and the world's peace and democracy camp. In these sorrowful days, we, the workers of the entire province, pledge under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, to unite more closely with the people of Czechoslovakia, consolidate the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and fight to the end for the cause of lasting peace in the world.

                                    The Jilin Provincial Federation of Trade Unions of China
                              March 15, 1953
