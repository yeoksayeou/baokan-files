North China Administrative Committee Chairman Liu Lantao

In 1953, the Central Committee put forward three great tasks: First, to continue to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and strive for greater victories; second, to begin implementing the nation's first Five-Year Plan and complete and overfulfill the 1953 construction plan; and third, to implement universal suffrage, convene people's congresses at the township, county, and provincial (municipal) levels, and convene the National People's Congress on this basis. We must mobilize and organize people of all circles and ethnic groups in the region to strive together to successfully complete the above tasks.

Over the past three years, under the wise leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong and the Central People's Government, the people of North China have actively and extensively carried out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, completed various important social reforms, further consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, and achieved significant achievements in economic recovery and development. These achievements have prepared favorable conditions for large-scale construction.

Based on the three major tasks put forward by the Central Committee and the specific situation in the North China region, the following are the main tasks for 1953:

1. Further strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea

In the face of the U.S. imperialism's various attempts to sabotage the armistice negotiations and deliberately expand the war of aggression against Korea, we must further strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and strive for greater victories, and never stop until a complete victory is won. To this end, we should further deepen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, strengthen patriotic education, prevent and correct complacency and slackness, and strengthen support for the Chinese People's Volunteers in terms of manpower and materials; earnestly do a good job in supporting the army, giving preferential treatment to military families, tilling land on their behalf, and providing treatment and condolences to the wounded and sick Volunteers; implement a universal militia system, establish backbone militia regiments, and prepare conditions for the implementation of compulsory military service; universally promote the patriotic inspection day system in rural areas and streets, further consolidate and give play to the role of patriotic pacts, and make resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea an important driving force for promoting various construction undertakings and overcoming all difficulties.

2. On industrial production

Our country's construction is focused on industrial construction, especially heavy industrial construction. In 1952, the increase production and practice economy movement in the region achieved great results. In 1953, the main tasks in industrial construction are: to ensure and supervise state-owned factories and mines to complete and overfulfill the state plan; to strengthen planning management, improve product quality, strengthen technical management, reduce product costs, strengthen cost and financial management, and strive for all major factories and mines to earnestly do a good job in economic accounting. The task of strengthening basic construction and accumulating basic construction experience should be elevated to a primary position.

(1) Strengthen planning management. Most factories and mines should continue to complete the assessment work and revise various plans for production and finance in 1953 based on the new quotas. Production and operation management should be guided according to the plan, so that factories, workshops, and teams can complete the plan monthly, every ten days, and even daily. Focus on promoting the advanced experience of "production according to instruction charts," and strengthen the planning concept of workers and leading cadres. Strengthen basic statistical work, regularly check the implementation of the plan, and solve problems in a timely manner.

(2) Strengthen technical management and improve product quality. In order to strictly enforce quality standards, technical operating procedures must be revised and formulated in accordance with the promotion of advanced experience, improve the inspection system and quality responsibility system, and earnestly correct the phenomenon of excessive defective products. Conscientiously implement the technical measures plan stipulated in the assessment process, summarize and promote advanced experience, and better unite and train technical personnel and give play to their enthusiasm, in order to improve the technical level of various factories and mines.

(3) On the basis of planning management, do a good job in cost management and financial management. Mobilize employees to work hard to reduce costs, save working capital, and complete cost and financial plans. Improve the professional level of accounting personnel, promote advanced experience in cost and finance, and strive to make financial and cost settlements accurate and timely.

(4) Implement the policy of "safety must not be forgotten in production, and safety is for production," solve safety equipment problems step by step, establish and improve safety institutions and safety responsibility systems, and strengthen employee safety education and strictly enforce labor discipline, and strive to reduce or even eliminate accidents. Conscientiously implement the revised Labor Insurance Regulations of the State Council and appropriately improve workers' lives.

(5) Strengthen the leadership of basic construction. The main problems currently existing in basic construction are: weak survey and design capabilities, lack of factory construction economics, and weak political work. In order to meet the needs of the country's large-scale construction, it is necessary to continue to allocate cadres to enrich and strengthen the leading organs, enrich design forces and improve design capabilities, train survey and mapping personnel, improve installation engineering technology, strengthen workers' political and technical education, and conscientiously accumulate and summarize the experience of national defense and factory basic construction in order to complete this year's planned tasks and prepare conditions for undertaking greater tasks next year.

(6) Under the leadership of the state-owned economy and the unified state plan, strengthen the guidance of private industry, help it improve technology and operation management, improve quality, and adapt to the needs of the masses to expand product sales.

(7) Organize and guide the production of local small industries and handicrafts to supplement the deficiencies of large industries and machine industrial production and meet social needs. Handicrafts should gradually implement cooperation under the leadership of the state economy and develop in the direction of semi-machine and machine industries.

In basic construction units and various factories and mines, efforts should be made to continue to tap potential, promote advanced production and management experience, and launch a high tide of learning from Soviet advanced experience according to needs and possibilities; mobilize the vast number of employees and organize a larger-scale patriotic production increase and economy competition to complete and overfulfill the state plan.

3. On agricultural production

The main tasks of agricultural production this year are: to further develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the patriotic production increase competition movement, vigorously promote advanced experience and science and technology, universally increase the yield per unit area, so as to increase the production of grain, industrial raw materials and export goods, and develop forestry, animal husbandry and fishery in a planned way according to different conditions. It is required that the total grain output increase by 12.8 percent compared with 1952; and the total cotton output increase by 13.2 percent compared with 1952.

(1) Further carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Strive to organize 80 percent of the total labor force in the region, reach about 10,000 agricultural production cooperatives, and pilot six collective farms. Agricultural production cooperatives should be closely combined with supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives, and promote various combined contracts to consolidate and improve agricultural production cooperatives, and comprehensively promote rural cooperative undertakings.

(2) The development of agriculture, water conservancy, forestry and animal husbandry should formulate long-term construction plans in accordance with the conditions of different regions. In addition to ensuring the completion of large-scale water conservancy projects, it is necessary to actively and in a planned way mobilize the masses to build small-scale water conservancy and water storage projects in all areas where conditions permit, and strengthen the management of existing channels and wells, improve irrigation methods, achieve rational water use, and adhere to long-term drought prevention and drought resistance. In areas with a larger proportion of animal husbandry, the main task is to increase the number of livestock and gradually improve the quality of livestock. To this end, attention should be paid to breeding and insemination, improving feeding management and disease treatment. In terms of forestry, it is necessary to universally mobilize the masses, organize them, vigorously plant trees, actively manage and nurture existing forests, and focus on building water source forests in mountainous areas to powerfully cooperate with soil and water conservation work.

(3) Carry out the patriotic production increase competition movement more deeply. It is required to increase production comprehensively, produce large areas of high yields, and universally increase the yield per unit area. The whole region should strive to create 100,000 high-yield mutual aid groups, 2,000 high-yield agricultural production cooperatives, 600 high-yield model villages, and 50 high-yield state-owned farms.

(4) Implement the method of "from the masses, to the masses," investigate, summarize and promote advanced production experience among the masses; combine with the agricultural production season, conduct scientific and technological publicity and education for farmers, widely conduct technical instruction through typical experiments, especially universally promote complete sets of high-yield experience for main crops, and constantly overcome the conservative thinking of farmers.

(5) Give full play to the favorable conditions of state-owned farms, conscientiously improve technology and operation management, strengthen political work, and do a good job in typical demonstrations.

(6) Conscientiously cultivate labor models. Political and ideological education must be strengthened for labor models, with encouragement and criticism, to help them overcome shortcomings and give full play to their leading role in agricultural production.

The spring plowing season is approaching, and all localities should seize the organization of a series of tasks such as accumulating fertilizer, transporting manure, harrowing the land to preserve moisture, preventing drought, regulating seeds, etc., to ensure timely sowing and not violating the farming season, and lay a good foundation for increasing production throughout the year.

4. On trade work

Strengthening material exchange, ensuring the supply of national construction and people's needs, continuing to maintain price stability, accelerating commodity turnover, and implementing the economic accounting system are the central tasks of trade work.

(1) Under the leadership of state-owned trade, in conjunction with cooperatives, unite private merchants, hold various forms of material exchange meetings in a planned way, strengthen the leadership and management of primary markets, and further enliven the urban and rural economy.

(2) Implement the adjustment of commercial policies, check the implementation of various price policies, and ensure that the price differences of various commodities are reasonable and that public-private and labor-capital relations develop normally.

(3) Vigorously promote industrial products, supply rural production materials and consumer goods, do a good job in seasonal procurement work, complete the annual purchase and sales plan, and maintain the stability of market prices.

(4) Resolutely correct the thinking of the supply system, overcome the blindness in operation and the phenomenon of serious commodity backlog, conscientiously implement the economic accounting system, cancel the domestic trade companies at the North China regional level, establish specialized wholesale stations, clear warehouses, verify funds, and accelerate capital turnover, reduce commodity circulation costs, and complete the task of turning over profits.

(5) Improve the policy and business level of trade cadres, strengthen investigation and research, find out the production situation, understand residents' needs, and better serve producers and consumers.

5. On financial work

The central tasks of financial work are: to ensure the needs of national large-scale construction funds, vigorously organize income on the basis of increasing production and practicing economy, strictly save expenditures, implement the unified budget and hierarchical management of national financial work, and strengthen enterprise financial management and financial supervision work.

(1) In terms of income, it is necessary to ensure the completion of tax revenue tasks and the completion of the state-owned enterprise profit turnover plan. Strengthen publicity work, implement the new tax system, do a good job in the investigation and research of tax sources, implement tax policies, strengthen the policy and business education of tax personnel, strictly implement the reward and punishment system, improve work style, and improve tax collection methods, so that the burden is further fair and reasonable. This year, it is necessary to set aside a certain amount of time, organize the necessary forces, and complete the work of land survey and fixed production in the entire region; in the collection, conscientiously implement the policy of calculating and collecting taxes according to rates and reducing and exempting taxes according to law, and implement reductions and exemptions conscientiously even if one village or one household is affected by disaster. At the same time, the mistakes of a few farmers in concealing land and output must also be checked and corrected to ensure that the burden is fair and reasonable and promote the agricultural production increase movement.

(2) In terms of expenditure, it is necessary to strictly implement the budget and final account system of no allocation without a budget and no reimbursement without a final account, strictly practice economy, distinguish between priorities and urgencies, and use state funds for major undertakings of decisive significance, overcome localism, departmentalism, and the blind enthusiasm to complete "good things" all at once, so as to fully guarantee the needs of national planned construction.

(3) Strengthen enterprise financial management, continue to tap production potential, reduce costs, and ensure that enterprise profits are turned over on time.

(4) Strengthen financial supervision work and conscientiously implement financial discipline. Those who undermine the financial system, violate financial discipline, and commit corruption, waste, and bureaucracy must be strictly punished.

6. Strengthen the construction of people's democratic power

The people's representative conferences of most counties in the region have already exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress. In order to further effectively lead and guarantee the smooth progress of national economic construction and cultural construction, the central task of the construction of people's democratic power this year is to convene the people's congresses of townships, counties, provinces (cities) with universal suffrage in accordance with the election law of the People's Congress formulated by the Central Committee. This is a new stage in the construction of people's democratic power and a major event in the political life of the people. It must be highly valued, strengthened leadership, and all preparations must be made in order to mobilize and organize people of all ethnic groups and circles in the region to conduct serious elections, elect the people they consider most satisfactory and necessary to the people's political power organs at all levels, further deepen the relationship between the people and the government, and strengthen the power of the people's democratic dictatorship.

Before the township elections, all localities should complete the township division work in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee, on the principle of facilitating administrative leadership, facilitating mass production, and taking into account natural conditions.

Continue to implement the ethnic policy and further support and improve the economic and cultural undertakings of minority ethnic groups.

Launch a "vigorous and mass-based movement to publicize the Marriage Law and inspect the implementation of the Marriage Law" throughout the region. This is an anti-feudal democratic reform movement and also a kind of ideological struggle within the people. The purpose is to make the broad masses of the people and cadres draw a clear line with feudal thinking, correctly implement the new democratic marriage system, and resolutely overcome thoughts and behaviors that violate the Marriage Law. "For a very small number of serious criminals who abuse and kill women and interfere with freedom of marriage, resulting in serious consequences and causing great popular indignation, they must be punished as they deserve according to law." In this movement, various methods should be adopted to continuously improve the political awareness of the broad masses of the people, especially women, guide and help them actively participate in political activities, and promote excellent women cadres in a planned way to participate in various national construction undertakings.

While strengthening the work of democratic construction, it is necessary to continue to eliminate all counter-revolutionary remnants in order to further consolidate social security and protect various construction projects.

7. On cultural, educational and health work

Cultural, educational and health work must be closely integrated with economic construction, and adopt the policy of consolidation, focused development, ensuring quality, and steady progress.

(1) Continue to improve the political and professional level of middle school teachers, improve teaching work, conscientiously overcome the chaotic phenomena in school work on a regular basis, and improve teaching quality. Rationally adjust secondary technical schools, clarify professional division of labor, and cultivate various construction talents according to the needs of economic construction. Improve the political awareness and professional ability of primary school teachers in a planned and guided way; actively rectify primary schools, focus on running complete primary schools and rural central primary schools well, verify the number of students, and overcome the phenomenon of mobility. Solve the learning problems of over-aged children in school in a planned way and gradually, so as to actually increase the enrollment rate of school-age children. Run workers' spare-time schools in key factories and mines well, and rectify and consolidate industrial and agricultural spare-time schools.

(2) Eliminate illiteracy. In the whole region, 2.55 million illiterate and semi-literate people have been enrolled in schools, including more than 310,000 workers, more than 2 million farmers, and 30,000 district cadres, of which 460,000 have reached the consolidation stage. This year is still a key experiment, and steady development is required. It is necessary to consolidate those who have already enrolled, correct the tendency to be greedy and rash, and prevent the tendency to relax the work of eliminating illiteracy.

(3) Organize creative forces, improve the ideological and professional level of literary and art workers, reward creation, and promote literary and art criticism, so as to strengthen and improve literary and art creation work. Strengthen cultural and artistic activities in industrial and mining areas, develop mass amateur cultural entertainment, develop film projection work, strengthen the management and guidance of opera troupes, especially old opera troupes, and enrich and improve the work of cultural centers and cultural stations.

(4) Health work should implement the policy of prevention first, continue to carry out the mass patriotic health movement, oppose the bacteriological warfare waged by U.S. imperialism, and strengthen factory and mine hygiene and maternal and child health work. Strengthen political learning and the study of Soviet advanced medicine among all health personnel. Train medical cadres in a planned way, and better unite, transform and use Chinese medicine.

(5) Widely carry out mass sports activities to enhance the people's physique and serve production, work, and the motherland.

8. Strengthen ideological leadership and improve leadership style

In order to complete the above glorious and arduous tasks, we must improve our leadership methods and leadership style. First, pay special attention to strengthening ideological and political leadership. The more arduous the task of economic construction, the more ideological and political leadership needs to be strengthened, to prevent and correct the tendency to only focus on economic affairs and neglect ideological and political leadership. Second, strengthen the democratic life of leading organs at all levels, improve the democratic system, regularly implement democratic inspections, and regularly carry out criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from below, so that the masses can regularly supervise our work. State personnel at all levels should do everything possible to closely link with the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, care about the hardships of the masses, and pay special attention to properly handling the work of mass letters and visits. Third, resolutely oppose bureaucracy and commandism, severely punish all those who violate laws and regulations, and conscientiously strengthen state discipline. Fourth, organize and send cadres to go deep into the lower levels to inspect and help work to ensure the correct implementation of various policies. Bureaucracy is a manifestation of bureaucracy and should be resolutely corrected.

All documents should adopt the principle of "rather fewer but better," do not write what can be written or not written, do not issue what can be issued or not issued, and strictly check and control the issuance of documents, so that they can truly solve work problems, otherwise, they will inevitably become waste paper and nonsense. Fifth, establish an overall perspective, implement the idea of centralized and unified leadership, obey the national plan, and overcome departmentalism. Sixth, strengthen the theoretical study and business study of cadres, especially senior cadres must strengthen theoretical study, combine theory with practical work, improve the level of ideological policy, and master their own business to meet the needs of large-scale construction.

    继续贯彻民族政策，进一步扶助与提高少数民族的经济文化事业。
    在全区开展一个“大张旗鼓的、群众性的宣传婚姻法及检查婚姻法执行情况的运动”。这是一种反封建的民主改革运动，也是人民内部的一种思想斗争。其目的是使广大人民群众和干部与封建思想划清界限，正确地实行新民主主义的婚姻制度，坚决克服违反婚姻法的思想和行为。“对于极少数虐待、杀害妇女以及干涉婚姻自由而造成严重恶果致民愤很大的严重犯罪分子，则须按法律予以应得的惩处”。在这一运动中，要采用各种方法，不断提高广大人民特别是妇女的政治觉悟，引导和帮助她们积极参加政治活动，有计划地提拔优秀的妇女干部，参加国家的各项建设事业。
    在加强民主建政工作的同时，必须继续肃清一切反革命残余，以进一步巩固社会治安和保卫各项建设。

    （五）广泛开展群众性的体育运动，增强人民的体质，为生产、为工作、为祖国服务。
    八、加强思想领导、改进领导作风
    为了完成上述光荣而艰巨的任务，就必须改进我们的领导方法与领导作风。第一，特别注意加强思想政治领导。经济建设任务愈繁重，思想政治领导愈需加强，防止和纠正只埋头于经济事务，而忽视思想政治领导的倾向。第二，加强各级领导机关的民主生活，健全民主制度，定期实行民主检查，经常开展批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，使群众经常能够监督我们的工作。各级国家工作人员要用尽一切办法，密切联系群众，倾听群众意见，关心群众疾苦，特别要注意正确处理群众来信、来访的工作。第三，坚决反对官僚主义和命令主义，严厉制裁一切违法乱纪的分子，认真加强国家的纪律。第四，有组织地派遣干部深入下层检查与帮助工作，以保证各项政策的正确执行。文牍主义是官僚主义的一种表现形式，应坚决予以改正。
    一切文件应采取“宁肯少些，但要好些”的原则，可写可不写者不写，可发可不发者不发，发文要严格检查与控制，要能真正解决工作问题，否则，必然成为废纸废话。第五，树立全局观点，贯彻集中统一的领导思想，服从国家计划，克服本位主义。第六，加强干部的理论学习与业务学习，特别是高级干部必须加强理论学习，使理论与实际工作结合起来，提高思想政策水平，精通自己的业务，以适应大规模建设的需要。
