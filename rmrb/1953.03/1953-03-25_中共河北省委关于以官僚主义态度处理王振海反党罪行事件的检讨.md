The serious incident of Wang Zhenhai, the former Secretary of the Ding County Party Committee, using his authority to retaliate against and frame Communist Party member Li Xiaoliu, reveals that the Provincial Committee bears significant responsibility in its leadership, and moreover, made serious errors in handling the matter.

We committed serious bureaucratic errors in handling this grave incident. From the time Comrade Fan Wenxing reported this serious incident to the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection until the publication of Comrade Fan Wenxing's letter in the People's Daily exposing Wang Zhenhai's violations of the law and discipline, a total of one year and four months elapsed. During this period, not only did we blindly approve the number of counter-revolutionaries (including Li Xiaoliu) that Wang Zhenhai reported for arrest before Fan Wenxing's accusation, but also, after the fact, we failed to handle the matter seriously. We delayed it repeatedly, each time weakening our stance, and finally, we erroneously adopted the approach of "settling the case with a signed guarantee," giving Wang Zhenhai a public warning as punishment, and concluding the matter hastily. Due to our serious bureaucracy, we failed to understand the situation and nature of this serious incident, believing the false report written by the Ding County Party Committee on behalf of Wang Zhenhai to the Provincial Committee, and believing Wang Zhenhai's lie that he "guaranteed with his Party membership" that he was not retaliating against or framing Li Xiaoliu. At the same time, we mistakenly believed that Wang Zhenhai and Fan Wenxing had "historical grudges," thereby obscuring and diluting this issue of political principle, listening only to Wang Zhenhai's lies, and committing a grave error.

Our commission of such serious bureaucratic errors is inseparable from our shortcomings in daily study and careful research of instructions from the higher Party authorities, resulting in political insensitivity. Because of our political insensitivity, our ability to proactively and consciously grasp the ideological situation within the Party, especially the ideological situation of key cadres, is very poor. We have an inadequate understanding of the fact that in the new victorious revolutionary situation, many cadres, especially some leading veteran cadres, are complacent and arrogant, developing privileged thinking, are undemocratic, fear criticism, and fear mass supervision, and that our Party is the ruling party, completely different from the underground party era. Insufficiently strict inspection and education of our cadres, especially leading cadres, creates the danger of serious problems arising. Because of the existence of the above problems, we do not see issues sharply, often failing to distinguish the nature and boundaries of issues, and do not treat issues seriously and conscientiously. Therefore, we do not deal with cadres who have made mistakes in a timely manner, or we do not deal with them properly. In this way, we actually encourage and indulge cadres' wrongdoings, ultimately harming the cadres and causing repeated losses to the Party.

Connected to the above errors, and a very important issue, is the failure to seriously accept the bloody lessons of the traitorous Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan incident. We were right-leaning in our cadre policy, showing leniency and indecision towards cadres who had made mistakes, especially leading cadres, because we thought they had a long history of struggle and great merits. Therefore, we did not value the materials submitted by the masses and lower-level cadres exposing their mistakes, and we did not use these to understand the extent to which leading organs and cadres were implementing policies and laws, or the ideological style of cadres. Because we did not value the opinions of ordinary cadres and the masses, this hindered the development of democracy within and outside the Party, preventing the doors and windows of democracy from being fully opened. The insufficient recognition of the seriousness of the Wang Zhenhai incident, the failure to clearly delineate the nature of the problem, and the sloppy handling of the matter fully demonstrate our one-sided listening and belief, and our failure to accept the painful lessons of the Liu and Zhang incident.

The serious bureaucracy, leniency towards cadres, and weak handling of problems in the past, connected with the Wang Zhenhai incident, have been extremely educational for us. The criticism given to the Provincial Committee by the North China Bureau is very necessary, and we fully agree with and accept this criticism.

From now on, we will not only be vigilant at all times against repeating past mistakes, but also be determined to resolutely correct them. We will focus on promoting inner-Party democracy, deeply carrying out criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism. At the same time, we will resolutely launch a struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of the law and discipline throughout the province, to demonstrate our determination to correct our mistakes.

    中共河北省委关于以官僚主义态度处理王振海反党罪行事件的检讨
    前定县地委书记王振海，利用职权、报复陷害共产党员李小六的严重事件，省委在领导上负有重大责任，而且在处理其问题时又犯了严重的错误。
    我们在处理这一严重事件上，犯了严重的官僚主义错误。从范文兴同志向省委纪律检查委员会揭发这一严重事件起，到人民日报发表范文兴同志揭发王振海违法乱纪的检举信止，共历时一年零四个月。而在这一时期中，我们不仅在范文兴检举前盲目地批准了王振海所报逮捕反革命分子（包括李小六在内）的数字，而且事后对问题处理亦不严肃，一拖再拖，越拖越松，最后竟对这一严重事件错误地采取“具结了案”的办法，给王振海以当众警告的处分，就此草草结束。由于我们存在着严重的官僚主义，对这一严重事件的情况和性质弄不清，相信了定县地委代替王振海向省委写的假报告，相信了王振海“用党籍担保”对李小六不是报复陷害的谎言；同时我们还误认为王振海和范文兴二人“有历史成见”，由此掩盖与冲淡了这一政治原则性问题，偏听偏信王振海的谎话，铸成了大错。
    我们犯这样严重的官僚主义错误，是与我们平日学习和细心钻研上级党的指示不够所造成的政治上迟钝这一缺点分不开的。由于我们政治上迟钝，所以主动地自觉地掌握党内思想情况特别是主要干部思想情况是很差的。对在新的革命胜利形势下，不少干部特别是一部分负责的老干部居功自傲，滋长着特权思想，不民主、怕批评、怕群众监督，以及我们的党是执政的党，与地下党时完全不同了，对我们的干部特别是负责的干部，检查教育不严，就有发生严重问题的危险这一点是认识不足的。因为上述问题的存在，看问题就不尖锐，往往将问题性质界限分不清，对待问题不严肃认真，所以对犯错误的干部处理就不及时，或处理得不当，如此，实际上就助长、放纵了干部的错误行为，结果是害了干部，对党也一再造成损失。
    与上述错误相连而且是很重要的问题，就是没有认真接受叛徒刘青山、张子善事件的血的教训，在干部政策上右倾，对犯错误的干部特别是对负责干部，以为他们的斗争历史长，功劳大，从而姑息、优柔寡断，也就不重视群众和下级干部检举他们错误的材料，不从这里边了解领导机关和干部执行政策法令的程度，以及干部的思想作风。由于不重视一般干部和群众的意见，这就障碍了党内外民主的发扬，使民主的门窗不能大开。如对王振海事件的严重性认识不足，问题性质的界限未划清，处理时马马虎虎，充分说明了我们偏听偏信，没有接受刘、张事件的惨痛教训。
    从过去的严重官僚主义、姑息干部、处理问题软弱等与王振海事件联系起来，对我们的教育是极为深刻的。华北局给省委以指责的处分是非常必要的，我们完全同意并接受这一处分。
    从此我们不仅随时警惕前犯错误，并痛下决心坚决改正。我们要着重发扬党内民主，深入开展批评与自我批评，尤其是自下而上的批评；同时在全省范围内，坚决开展反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争，来表明我们改正错误的决心。
