Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 27th: According to the "Canadian Forum," after the Canadian Peace Congress initiated February 28th as a National Day for a Korean Armistice, many groups and citizens across Canada responded. From Vancouver to Quebec, tens of thousands of leaflets were distributed in every major city, and many rallies were held demanding an armistice in Korea.

Vancouver held a rally for an armistice in Korea attended by three thousand people. Dr. James Endicott, Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, said at the meeting that a proposal for an armistice in Korea is urgently needed to prevent the expansion of the war in the Far East. On Korean Armistice Day, five thousand leaflets were distributed in Vancouver alone.

After the movement for an armistice in Korea entered March, Dr. Endicott gave speeches at rallies in several western locations. He pointed out that broad world opinion supports the idea of an immediate armistice. The U.S. military seems to want to solve the unresolved prisoner of war issue by continuing the war, which is not a solution. This policy will only expand the war. Dr. Endicott said, "An immediate armistice is the most intelligent and necessary path."

The "Canadian Forum" continued, the activities for a Korean Armistice Day have strengthened the protests in Canada against Eisenhower's instigation of the Taiwan Kuomintang bandit gang to harass China. Toronto, cities in the northwest of the Great Lakes, and Montreal have sent telegrams to the Canadian Prime Minister and Members of Parliament expressing their protest.

According to the Montreal "Petit Journal," the Quebec Provincial Labor Peace Committee, in a telegram sent to Canadian Prime Minister St. Laurent, opposed Eisenhower's statement on expanding the scope of the Korean War, and said: "We ask Parliament to immediately declare its opposition to the expansion of the war in Asia, to advocate an immediate end to the Korean War, and to negotiate the prisoner of war issue peacefully as the only way to improve the international situation."

The Toronto Peace Council used propaganda vehicles to broadcast appeals for a ceasefire on the streets for two consecutive days, and also distributed 56,000 leaflets calling for a ceasefire and placed a large advertisement in the best-selling daily newspaper. Mrs. Libby Park, Secretary of the Toronto Peace Council, said: "Many groups, committees and individuals are cooperating with us."

Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: TASS, Moscow, March 27th: "Pravda" correspondent Litosko wrote in a New York dispatch: The peace movement in the United States is gaining more and more support.

As the Korean War continues, American civilians are increasingly aware that the struggle for peace is their own business, something extremely important to them. Good people are finding various ways to express their indignation at the Korean War and to voice their calls for peace, regardless of obstacles and difficulties.

Litosko said: In October last year, an unusual peace conference was held in Springfield, Illinois. The theme of the conference was the slogan "Save Our Sons." Attending the conference were the parents, relatives, and friends of American soldiers in Korea. The conference was proposed by Florence Koziar, an ordinary American woman.

Litosko described how news of the conference quickly spread throughout the western part of the country. Fathers, mothers, wives, and loved ones of soldiers in Korea came to Springfield from twenty-seven towns and many rural areas. Their speeches were full of pain and anger, because the Korean War had inflicted deep, incurable wounds on the heart of each of them.

The "Save Our Sons" movement is flourishing. "Save Our Sons" committees have been organized in seventeen states.

Litosko wrote: The activities of American peace advocates take various forms.

A small town in Texas held a peace festival attended by more than 10,000 people. The basic spirit of the festival was to defend peace and promote international friendship.

A group of young men and women in Detroit collected the signatures of 5,000 young men and women in Detroit on a petition demanding an end to the Korean War in a few days.

On the streets of New York and other cities, one can see young people in military uniforms without insignia distributing leaflets or soliciting signatures for peace appeals. Not long ago, three Korean War veterans, Dick Davis, Joseph Harris, and Brian Bradley, called on veterans who had fought in Korea to stand up for peace and demand an end to this bloody war. This call was met with enthusiastic response from veterans.

Litosko continued: The longer the Korean War drags on, the higher the taxes and cost of living, the more loudly the American working people will call for the defense of peace.

The American Peace Crusade, an organization representing broad sections of the American people, unanimously passed a resolution at an activist conference held in Chicago in mid-March, calling on all peace-loving Americans to wage a more persistent struggle for an immediate end to the Korean War, for a peaceful settlement of disputes between major powers, for disarmament, and for a ban on weapons of mass destruction.

    加美两国人民要求在朝鲜停战
    加拿大各地举行争取朝鲜停战日集会和平运动在美国得到愈来愈大的拥护
    【新华社布拉格二十七日电】据“加拿大论坛报”报道：在加拿大和平大会发起以二月二十八日为全国争取朝鲜停战日后，加拿大全国各地许多团体与公民纷纷响应。从温哥华一直到魁北克，每个大城市中都散发了成千上万张传单，举行了许多集会，要求在朝鲜停战。
    温哥华举行了一次有三千人参加的争取在朝鲜停战的集会。加拿大和平大会主席文幼章博士在会上说，为了防止远东战争的扩大，争取在朝鲜停战的建议是非常迫切需要的。在争取朝鲜停战日，仅在温哥华就散发了五千张传单。
    争取在朝鲜停战运动进入三月后，文幼章博士曾在西部几个地方的集会上发表演说。他指出，世界广大舆论都支持立即停战的主张。美国军队看来想用继续战争的办法来解决尚未解决的战俘问题，这样是决不能解决的。这种政策只会扩大战争。文幼章博士说：“立即停战是最聪明的与必要的途径。”
    “加拿大论坛报”继续说，争取朝鲜停战日的活动使加拿大抗议艾森豪威尔怂恿台湾国民党匪帮骚扰中国的运动声势更加壮大了。多伦多、大湖西北部城市与蒙特利尔各地纷纷拍电报给加拿大总理与议员，表示抗议。
    据蒙特利尔“小日报”讯，魁北克省劳工和平委员会在拍给加拿大总理圣劳伦的电报中反对艾森豪威尔的扩大朝鲜战争范围的声明，并说：“我们要求议会立即声明反对扩大亚洲的战争、主张立即停止朝鲜战争、和平谈判战俘问题，作为改善国际局势的唯一办法。”
    多伦多和平理事会连续两天用宣传车在街上进行呼吁停战的广播，此外还散发了五万六千张要求停战的传单，并在销路最大的日报上刊登大幅广告。多伦多和平理事会秘书李比·帕克夫人说：“许多团体、委员会与个人跟我们合作。” 【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：“真理报”记者利托斯科在一篇纽约通讯中写道：和平运动在美国正受到愈来愈多的人的拥护。
    随着朝鲜战争的进行，美国平民越来越清楚地了解，争取和平的斗争是他们自己的事情，是对他们极其重要的事情。善良的人们正不顾一切障碍与困难，找寻各种不同的方法表示他们对于朝鲜战争的愤慨，并发出保卫和平的呼声。
    利托斯科说：在去年十月间，伊利诺斯州的斯普林腓特城召开了一个很不平常的和平会议。这个会议的主题是“拯救我们的儿子”这个口号。出席这个会议的是在朝鲜的美国士兵的父母、亲戚和朋友。这个会议是由美国一位普通妇女弗罗兰斯·考芝尔提议召开的。
    利托斯科叙述这个会议的消息如何迅速地传遍了这个国家的西部。在朝鲜的士兵的父亲们、母亲们、妻子们和爱人们，从二十七个城镇和许多农村来到斯普林腓特。他们的演说充满了痛苦和愤怒，因为朝鲜战争使他们每一个人的内心都受到了很深的无法治愈的创伤。
    “拯救我们的儿子”运动正在蓬勃发展。“拯救我们的儿子”委员会已经在十七个州组织起来了。
    利托斯科写道：美国和平拥护者的活动采取了各种各样的形式。
    一个小小的得克萨斯城举行了一个和平节，参加的人数有一万多。这个节的基本精神就是保卫和平和促进国际友谊。
    底特律的一批男女青年在几天时间内就征得五千个底特律青年男女在要求结束朝鲜战争的请愿书上签名。
    在纽约和其他城市的街道上，人们会看见穿军服而没有军章的青年人在散发传单或征求呼吁和平的签名。不久以前三个朝鲜战争的退伍军人狄克·戴维斯，约瑟夫·哈里斯和布利安·布莱德雷呼吁那些曾在朝鲜作过战的复员军人起来保卫和平并要求停止这个流血的战争。这个呼吁得到退伍军人的热烈响应。
    利托斯科继续写道：朝鲜战争拖得越久，捐税和生活费用越高，美国劳动人民就越要大声疾呼保卫和平。
    代表广泛阶层的美国人民的美国和平十字军组织三月中旬在芝加哥举行的积极分子会议，一致通过了决议，要求所有爱好和平的美国人民进行更加坚持不渝的斗争，争取立即停止朝鲜战争，要求和平解决各大国之间的纠纷，要求裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性的武器。
