    The Greatest Friendship
    Mao Zedong
    The greatest genius of our time, the great teacher of the world communist movement, and the comrade-in-arms of the immortal Lenin – Comrade Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin has passed away.

    Comrade Stalin's contributions to our time, both in theoretical and practical activities, are immeasurable. Comrade Stalin represents a whole new era for us. His activities guided the Soviet people and the working people of all countries in transforming the world situation, that is, the cause of justice, people's democracy, and socialism has achieved victory on a large scale in the world, in an area inhabited by more than one-third of the world's population – over 800 million people. Moreover, the influence of this victory is increasingly spreading to every corner of the world.

    Comrade Stalin's death has caused incomparable and heavy grief to the working people of the world, stirring the hearts of all righteous people in the world. This shows that Comrade Stalin's cause and his ideas have been grasped by the broad masses of people around the world and have become an invincible force. This force will guide the people who have already achieved victory to enter new victories, and will also guide all those who are still groaning under the oppression of the evil capitalist old world to bravely attack the enemies of the people.

    After Lenin's death, Comrade Stalin guided the Soviet people in building the world's first socialist country, which he and the great Lenin jointly founded during the October Revolution, into a bright and splendid socialist society. The victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union is not only a victory for the Soviet people but also a common victory for the people of the world. First, this victory proved the infinite correctness of Marxism-Leninism in the most realistic way of life, and specifically educated the working people of the world on how to move towards a better life. Second, this victory guaranteed that mankind would have the strength to defeat the fascist beasts in World War II. It is inconceivable that the victory of the anti-fascist war could have been achieved without the victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union. The victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and the victory of the anti-fascist war are related to the fate of all mankind, and the glory of these victories should be attributed to our great Comrade Stalin.

    Comrade Stalin comprehensively and epoch-makingly developed the theory of Marxism-Leninism, pushing the development of Marxism to a new stage. Comrade Stalin creatively developed Lenin's theory on the uneven development of capitalism and the theory that socialism could achieve victory first in one country; Comrade Stalin creatively contributed the theory on the general crisis of the capitalist system, the theory on building communism in the Soviet Union, the theory on the basic economic laws of modern capitalism and socialism, and the theory on colonial and semi-colonial revolutions. Comrade Stalin also creatively developed Lenin's theory on party building. All these creative theories of Comrade Stalin's further united the workers of the world, further united the oppressed classes and oppressed people of the world, and enabled the struggle for liberation and happiness and its victory to reach an unprecedented scale for the world's working class and all oppressed people.

    All of Comrade Stalin's works are immortal Marxist documents. His "Foundations of Leninism," "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union," and his last great work, "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," are encyclopedias of Marxism-Leninism, a synthesis of the experiences of the world communist movement over the past century. His speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a valuable testament to the communists of all countries in the world. Like communists in all countries, we Chinese communists seek the path to our victory from Comrade Stalin's great works.

    Since Lenin's death, Comrade Stalin has always been the central figure in the world communist movement. We have constantly gathered around him, constantly asked him for advice, and constantly drawn ideological strength from his writings. Comrade Stalin was filled with enthusiasm for the oppressed people of the East. "Do not forget the East" - this was Comrade Stalin's great call after the October Revolution. People know that Comrade Stalin loved the Chinese people and believed that the power of the Chinese revolution was immeasurable. He dedicated lofty wisdom to the issue of the Chinese revolution. It was precisely by following the teachings of Lenin and Stalin and receiving the support of the great Soviet state and all revolutionary forces in various countries that the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people won a historic victory a few years ago.

    Now, we have lost our great teacher and most sincere friend - Comrade Stalin. What misfortune! The sorrow that this misfortune has given us cannot be described in words.

    Our task is to transform grief into strength. In order to commemorate our great teacher Stalin, the great friendship between the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, under the name of Stalin, will be strengthened infinitely. The Chinese communists and the Chinese people will study Stalin's teachings and learn from Soviet science and technology even more closely in order to build our country.

    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a party personally cultivated by Lenin and Stalin, the most advanced, experienced, and theoretically cultivated party in the world; this party has been and is our model, and will continue to be our model in the future. We firmly believe that the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government, headed by Comrade Malenkov, will surely be able to inherit Comrade Stalin's legacy and carry the great cause of communism forward and bring it to a greater glory.

    Without a doubt, the world camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, headed by the Soviet Union, will become more united and stronger.

    For thirty years, Comrade Stalin's teachings and the example of socialist construction in the Soviet Union have propelled the world forward by leaps and bounds. Now the Soviet Union has reached such strength, the Chinese People's Revolution has achieved such a great victory, the construction of various people's democratic countries has made such tremendous achievements, the movement against oppression and aggression of the people of all countries in the world has risen to such a high level, and our front of friendship and unity is so consolidated, so it can be completely asserted that we are not afraid of any imperialist aggression. Any imperialist aggression will be crushed by us, and all despicable provocations are completely useless.

    The reason why the friendship between the great Chinese and Soviet peoples is unbreakable is because our friendship is based on the great internationalist principles of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples and the peoples of all people's democratic countries, and the friendship between all peace-loving, democratic, and just people in all countries of the world, is also based on such great internationalist principles, and therefore is also unbreakable.

    Clearly, the power generated by this kind of friendship is infinite and truly invincible.

    Let all imperialist aggressors and war-mongers tremble before our great friendship!

    Long live the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin!

    The great name of Stalin will live forever!

    最伟大的友谊
    毛泽东
    当代最伟大的天才，世界共产主义运动伟大的导师，不朽的列宁的战友——约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林同志与世长辞了。
    斯大林同志在理论的活动上和在实际的活动上所给予我们当代的贡献，是不可估量的。斯大林同志代表了我们整个的一个新时代。他的活动引导苏联人民和各国劳动人民转移了全世界的局面，这即是正义的、人民民主的和社会主义的事业在世界大规模的范围内，在地球上人口三分之一——八万万人以上的范围内取得了胜利，而且这种胜利的影响，正日益普及到全世界的每一个角落。
    斯大林同志的逝世，使全世界的劳动人民感到了无可比拟的沉重的悲痛，激动着全世界的正义的人们的心。这就是表明，斯大林同志的事业和他的思想掌握了全世界的广大人民群众，而且业已变成了无敌的力量，这种力量将引导那已取得胜利的人民由胜利进入新的胜利，同时也将引导那一切还在邪恶的资本主义旧世界压迫下呻吟的人们能够对于人民的敌人进行勇敢的冲击。
    在列宁逝世之后，斯大林同志指导苏联人民，把他和伟大的列宁在十月革命时期共同缔造的世界第一个社会主义国家建成了光明灿烂的社会主义社会。苏联社会主义建设的胜利，这不只是苏联人民的胜利，而且是全世界人民共同的胜利。第一、这个胜利用最现实的生活证明了马克思列宁主义的无限正确，具体地教育了全世界劳动人民应该如何朝着美好的生活前进。第二、这个胜利保证了在第二次世界大战中人类能够有战胜法西斯野兽的力量。不能设想，没有苏联社会主义建设的胜利，而能够有反法西斯战争的胜利。苏联建设社会主义的胜利和反法西斯战争的胜利是关系全人类的命运的，而这些胜利的光荣应当归于我们伟大的斯大林同志。
    斯大林同志全面地划时代地发展了马克思列宁主义的理论，把马克思主义的发展推进到新的阶段。斯大林同志创造性地发展了列宁关于资本主义发展不平衡规律的理论和关于社会主义可能在一个国家内首先胜利的理论；斯大林同志创造性地贡献了关于资本主义体系总危机的理论，贡献了关于在苏联建设共产主义的理论，贡献了关于现代资本主义和社会主义的基本经济法则的理论，贡献了关于殖民地半殖民地革命的理论。斯大林同志还创造性地发展了列宁关于党的建设的理论。斯大林同志这一切创造性的理论，进一步地把全世界的工人们联合起来，进一步地把全世界的被压迫阶级和被压迫人民联合起来，使世界的工人阶级和一切被压迫的人们为解放和幸福的斗争及其胜利达到空前未有的规模。
    斯大林同志的一切著作都是马克思主义的不朽的文献。他所著的“列宁主义基础”、“苏联共产党历史”以及他最后的伟大著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”，是马克思列宁主义的百科全书，是百年来世界共产主义运动经验的综合。他在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说，是给世界各国共产党人的一篇宝贵的遗嘱。我们中国共产党人和世界各国共产党人一样，是从斯大林同志的伟大的著作中去找寻自己胜利的途径的。
    从列宁逝世以来，斯大林同志一直是世界共产主义运动的中心人物。我们围绕着他，不断地向他请教，不断地从他的著作中吸取思想的力量。斯大林同志充满了对于东方被压迫人民的热情。“不要忘记东方”——这是斯大林同志在十月革命之后的伟大号召。人们都知道：斯大林同志热爱中国人民，认为中国革命的力量是不可估量的。在中国革命问题上，他献出了崇高的智慧。中国共产党和中国人民正是遵循列宁斯大林的学说，得到了伟大的苏维埃国家和各国一切革命力量的支持，而在几年以前获得了历史性的胜利。
    现在，我们失去了伟大的导师和最真挚的朋友——斯大林同志。这是多么的不幸呵！这个不幸所给予我们的悲痛，是不能够用言语来形容的。
    我们的任务是要把悲痛化为力量。为着纪念我们伟大的导师斯大林，中国共产党和中国人民同苏联共产党和苏联人民，在斯大林的名义下的伟大友谊将无限地加强起来。中国共产党人和中国人民将更加紧学习斯大林的学说，学习苏联的科学和技术，以建设我们的国家。
    苏联共产党是列宁斯大林亲手教养起来的党，是世界上最先进的、最有经验的和最有理论修养的党；这个党在过去和现在是我们的模范，在将来也还是我们的模范。我们完全相信以马林科夫同志为首的苏共中央和苏联政府是一定能够继承斯大林同志的遗志，而把伟大的共产主义事业推向前进，并且发扬光大的。
    毫无疑义，以苏联为首的世界和平、民主和社会主义阵营将变得更加团结，更加强大。
    三十年来，斯大林同志的学说和苏联社会主义建设的榜样，推动了世界的大踏步前进。现在苏联已达到这样的强大，中国人民革命已获得这样的伟大胜利，各人民民主国家的建设已有这样的巨大成就，世界各国人民的反压迫反侵略的运动已有这样的高涨，而我们的友谊和团结的阵线又是这样的巩固，所以，完全可以断言，对于任何帝国主义的侵略，我们都是不怕的。任何帝国主义的侵略都将被我们所粉碎，一切卑鄙的挑拨都是完全没有用的。
    伟大的中苏两国人民的友谊之所以是牢不可破的，因为我们的友谊是根据马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大的国际主义的原则而建立起来的。中苏两国人民和各人民民主国家人民之间的友谊，和全世界各国一切爱好和平、民主及正义的人民之间的友谊，也正是建立在这样伟大的国际主义原则上，因此，也就是牢不可破的。
    显然，我们这种友谊所产生的力量是无穷无尽和真正无敌的。
    让一切帝国主义侵略者和战争贩子们在我们伟大的友谊面前颤抖吧！
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说万岁！
    伟大的斯大林的英名永垂不朽！
