    Jilin and Liaodong Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools Affiliated with Northeast People's University

    According to the decision of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Education of the former Northeast People's Government on the affiliation of worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools to institutions of higher education, the Jilin Province Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School and the Liaodong Province Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School have been merged and formally affiliated with Northeast People's University. The Dalian Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School is also affiliated with Dalian Institute of Technology.

    Based on the pilot experience of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government in establishing worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools affiliated with Peking University and Tsinghua University, the affiliation of worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools to institutions of higher education as preparatory schools for institutions of higher education can not only enable worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools to implement key classified teaching plans that are closely linked to the curriculum of institutions of higher education, but also obtain specific assistance and guidance from institutions of higher education in teaching and equipment. At the same time, it can gradually change the student composition of institutions of higher education, so that institutions of higher education can better open their doors to the worker-peasant masses. Therefore, Northeast People's University and Dalian Institute of Technology attach great importance to taking over worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools. Northeast People's University has also appropriately adjusted the teachers and cadres of the worker-peasant accelerated secondary school in order to gradually improve and enhance the teaching work of the worker-peasant accelerated secondary school.

    吉林、辽东工农速成中学附设于东北人民大学
    根据中央人民政府教育部及原东北人民政府教育部关于工农速成中学附设于高等学校的决定，吉林省工农速成中学及辽东省工农速成中学已实行合并，正式附设于东北人民大学。大连工农速成中学亦附设于大连工学院。
    根据中央人民政府教育部在北京大学及清华大学附设工农速成中学的试办经验，工农速成中学附设于高等学校作为高等学校的预备学校，不但可使工农速成中学实施重点分类的教学计划与高等学校课程密切衔接，并可在教学与设备方面得到高等学校的具体帮助和指导，同时又可逐渐地改变高等学校的学生成份，使高等学校更好地向工农群众开门。因此，东北人民大学、大连工学院对接办工农速成中学，均极为重视。东北人民大学并已适当调整了工农速成中学的教员和干部，以便逐步改进与提高工农速成中学的教学工作。
