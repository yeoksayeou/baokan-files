Xinhua News Agency report: People from all over the world are mourning the death of the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, with infinite grief and unwavering resolve.

    Togliatti Writes Article in Memory of Comrade Stalin
The "Pravda" published an article by Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, entitled: "Stalin's Cause Will Live Forever and Triumph Forever."

Togliatti wrote: Like Marx and Lenin, Stalin left the deepest mark on human history. He was a scientific Marxist guide. Stalin transformed the world, and because of his great activities, the world is fundamentally different from the past. Socialism and communism are no longer dreams. They are already embodied in the powerful Soviet Union.

Togliatti said: The names of Lenin and Stalin are inseparable from this century. In the past, the liberation struggles of the working class and the people of all countries have never been so grand in scale, nor so difficult and complex. Stalin, together with Lenin, led this struggle; after Lenin's death, he developed Lenin's cause under new conditions. He solved the most difficult problems in the most complex situations. His victory became a milestone of decisive significance on the road of human progress.

When the Soviet Union was perfidiously attacked, Stalin led the Soviet people of all nationalities in the anti-fascist war and won the most brilliant military victory in history.

Imperialism threatens the people of all countries with war. Disregarding the people's desire for peace, they conspire to surround socialist and democratic countries with an iron fence. They sow the seeds of hatred among countries and poison the world with rumors and slanders. In these days, Stalin's teachings have helped the people of all countries. Stalin proved that peace can be maintained. Stalin told the people of all countries that the future of the world rests with them, as long as they take on the task of defending peace, expose and isolate the warmongers, and defend their independence and freedom from any infringement. Stalin made a decisive contribution to the formation of the international peace front; now, this international peace front has become a powerful force, and its prestige is growing higher and higher around the world.

Togliatti pointed out: The present is a crucial period in human history. There may be new wars in the future, or there may be long-term peaceful cooperation. We are working hard to achieve peace and cooperation. Stalin led us to fight for this purpose; he will continue to lead us forward.

Those who talk nonsense in the corrupt imperialist newspapers about the teachings and doctrines of Stalin being "possibly" betrayed after his death are foolish and pathetic provocateurs. The people and parties of all countries who have been cultivated and guided by Stalin firmly believe in their own strength. They must advance along the path of progress and peace indicated by Stalin.

Stalin has left us, but his resolute genius is immortal. Stalin's cause will live forever and triumph forever. Stalin's cause will triumph throughout the world.

    Indonesian People Mourn Stalin with Grief
The Indonesian people mourn the leader and teacher of the working people of the world, Comrade Stalin, with grief.

In addition to sending a telegram of condolence, the Indonesian Communist Party issued a bulletin calling on all party members to follow the teachings of Comrade Stalin, maintain the excellent qualities of party members, maintain unity within the party like protecting their own eyes, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance as the basis of the united front, respect and loyally strive for the democratic rights and national independence of the people, adhere to the principle of proletarian internationalism, and strengthen the solidarity of the working people of the world.

The Indonesian Communist Party also convened a memorial meeting for Comrade Stalin. When the party's deputy secretary, Sudisman, delivered a eulogy, he called on all party members to work hard to improve their theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism and do their work better.

The Indonesian Awakened Women's Association sent a telegram to the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, expressing deep condolences on the death of Stalin.

Many Indonesian progressive newspapers reported the news of Stalin's death and published editorials mourning Stalin, printing Stalin's portrait on the front page of the newspapers with a black border. The Jakarta "People's Daily" published an editorial saying: Under the leadership of Stalin, the Soviet people finally defeated the barbaric Nazi army in the anti-fascist war and rescued the people of the world from the scourge of fascism. Anyone who cares about the history after World War II must recognize Stalin's great contribution to the cause of saving world peace. Stalin's death will make the world people's will to defend world lasting peace more vigorous, which will make the warmongers feel fear.

Indonesian news agencies and many newspapers belonging to different parties praised Stalin's great achievements. Antara News Agency published an article about Stalin's life and deeds. The article wrote: Stalin had contributed everything to the cause of striving for liberation and happiness for the oppressed people during his lifetime; Stalin was a world peace fighter, and he taught all mankind to hate war and love peace. The Medan "Vigilance Daily" said: Stalin, who was loved by friends and feared by enemies, was indeed a genius leader. The "Observer" said: It must be admitted that Stalin has not only made the Soviet Union a powerful country in thirty years, but also made his ideas influence all countries in the world; facts have proved Stalin's noble qualities and great personality.

    Brazilian Communist Party Issues Letter to the Brazilian Working Class and People
The Brazilian "People's Daily" published a letter from the National Committee of the Brazilian Communist Party to the Brazilian working class and people on the death of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.

The announcement stated: Stalin was the greatest defender of peace and human happiness. No one has ever been so loved by the people as he was. Hundreds of millions of people around the world listen to his voice and follow his wise instructions. Mentioning his name increases confidence in victory. The workers and all honest people in our country feel infinite grief for the death of the great Stalin.

The National Committee of the Brazilian Communist Party called on the people to raise the banner of peace, freedom and national independence and strengthen the struggle against the warmongers. The National Committee reaffirmed its unwavering loyalty to the Soviet Union. The National Committee now swears again: The Brazilian people will never wage war against socialist countries. In the struggle for a better future, the people will win. The banner of the great Stalin is in the hands of the invincible Soviet Communist Party and its Central Committee.

    French People Mourn Comrade Stalin
Several thousand Parisians attended a gathering held by the France-Soviet Union Association on the evening of the 13th to mourn Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin. The presidium of the memorial meeting was composed of Marcel Cachin, Vice President of the France-Soviet Union Association, General Petit, Vice President of the French Women's League, Françoise Leclerc, and representatives of other progressive organizations and social leaders in France.

General Petit delivered a eulogy at the meeting, emphasizing that the French people felt infinite grief for the death of Stalin. He said: Stalin is dead, but his cause will live forever. Stalin said that if the people of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace and persist in this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated. These words will always remain in the hearts of the people of all countries.

According to the "Humanité" newspaper, when the head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, Vyshinsky, arrived at the port of Le Havre, France, from New York by boat, the working people of Le Havre sent a delegation to present him with flowers to mourn the death of Stalin. On the ribbon holding the flowers was written: The people of Le Havre will always remember Stalin.

The "Humanité" published an article by Pierre Goudard on the 13th, praising the Soviet Union's peace policy. Goudard said: Thanks to Stalin and the Soviet people, we are not slaves of the Hitler Empire today. The praise of billions of people for the system of no exploitation and their gratitude to Stalin and the Soviet Union cannot be changed by any police, any threats, or any terror. The moving events of the past few days have proved the rock-solid consolidation of the Soviet regime, and proved the strength of the friendly unity between the oppressed working people of the world and all those who uphold peace and the Soviet Union.

    British People Remember Stalin
The London "Daily Worker" said on March 11: It has received many letters from readers expressing "the simple and touching mourning of ordinary people for the death of Stalin." The "Daily Worker" published some of these letters.

Bright of Mendenston City, Kent, wrote in his letter: "We commemorate Stalin by making more efforts to convince the British people that it is extremely important to force Churchill and Eisenhower to meet with representatives of the Soviet people to discuss world peace."

"Let us create a century of peace, an immortal achievement, as our best memorial to Stalin, who dedicated his life to the working class."

A reader from North London wrote in his letter: "In human history, who else in his life can prove as undoubtedly as Stalin that workers can build socialist countries?"

"As we commemorate him, let us strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts to bring socialism and peace to all mankind."

A reader from Southeast London wrote in his letter: "Perhaps there are hundreds of millions of people in this island country like me who have not forgotten the man who so bravely resisted the strong enemy and defended Stalingrad. If the enemy he resisted had turned around and used such great strength to deal with us at that time, we might have been defeated."

    全世界人民悼念伟大导师斯大林
    据新华社讯：世界各国人民以无限悲痛的和坚定的心情悼念全世界劳动人民伟大的领袖和导师约·维·斯大林的逝世。
      陶里亚蒂撰文悼念斯大林同志
    “真理报”登载了意大利共产党总书记帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂的文章，题目是：“斯大林的事业永远长存，永远胜利”。
    陶里亚蒂写道：像马克思和列宁一样，斯大林给人类历史留下了最深刻的痕迹。他是科学的马克思主义的指导者。斯大林改造了世界，由于他的伟大的活动，现在世界和过去根本不同。社会主义和共产主义已经不再是梦想了。它们已经体现在强大的苏联身上。
    陶里亚蒂说：列宁和斯大林的名字，是和这个世纪分不开的。在过去，工人阶级和各国人民的解放斗争从来没有这样规模宏大，也从来没有这样困难和复杂。斯大林和列宁一道领导了这个斗争；在列宁逝世以后，他又在新的条件下发展了列宁的事业。他在最复杂的情况下，解决了最困难的问题。他的胜利成了全人类进步道路上有决定意义的里程碑。
    当苏联国土遭到了背信弃义的进攻时，斯大林领导苏联各族人民，进行了反法西斯战争，并且取得了有史以来最辉煌的军事胜利。
    帝国主义以战争威胁着各国人民。它们不顾人民的和平愿望，阴谋用一道铁栏把社会主义和民主国家包围起来。它们在各国间散播仇恨的种子，用谣言和诽谤来毒害世界。在这些日子里，斯大林的教导又帮助了各国人民。斯大林证明，和平是可以维护的。斯大林告诉世界各国人民：世界的前途系在他们身上，只要他们把保卫和平的工作担当起来，揭露并且孤立战争制造者，维护他们的独立和自由不受任何侵犯。斯大林对国际和平阵线的组成提供了决定性的贡献；现在，这个国际和平阵线已经成为强大的力量，它的威望在全世界越来越高。
    陶里亚蒂指出：目前是人类历史上的一个关键时期。将来可以有新的战争，也可以有长期的和平合作。我们正在努力争取和平与合作。斯大林领导了我们为这个目的而斗争；他还要继续领导我们前进。
    那些在腐化的帝国主义报章上大谈什么在斯大林逝世以后，他的教导与学说“可能”被背弃的人真是愚蠢与可怜的挑拨者。受到斯大林培养和指导的各国人民和各国的党，都坚定不移地相信自己的力量。他们一定沿着斯大林所指示的进步与和平的道路前进。
    斯大林已经离开了我们，但是他的坚毅的天才是不朽的。斯大林的事业永远长存，永远胜利。斯大林的事业将在全世界胜利。
      印尼人民沉痛悼念斯大林
    印尼人民沉痛悼念全世界劳动人民的领袖和导师斯大林同志。
    印尼共产党除拍发了唁电外，还发出公告，号召全体党员遵循斯大林同志的教导，保持党员的优秀品质，像保护自己的眼珠一样保持党内的团结，加强工农联盟作为统一战线的基础，尊重和忠诚地争取人民的民主权利和民族独立，坚持无产阶级国际主义的原则，加强全世界劳动人民的团结。
    印尼共产党还召开了追悼斯大林同志的大会，党的副书记苏蒂斯曼致悼词时号召全体党员努力提高自己的马克思列宁主义的理论水平，把工作做得更好。
    印尼觉醒妇女协会打电报给苏联妇女反法西斯委员会，对斯大林的逝世表示沉痛的悼念。
    许多印尼进步报纸在报道斯大林逝世消息的同时，发表社论哀悼斯大林，在报纸第一版刊载斯大林遗像并加上黑边。雅加达“人民日报”发表社论说：在斯大林的领导下，苏联人民在反法西斯战争中最后击败了野蛮的纳粹军队，把世界人民从法西斯的危害中拯救出来，任何关心第二次世界大战后的历史的人，都必然承认斯大林在拯救世界和平的事业中的伟大功绩。斯大林的逝世，将使世界人民保卫世界持久和平的意志更加蓬勃，这就将使战争贩子们感到恐惧。
    印尼的通讯社和许多属于不同党派的报纸都赞扬斯大林的伟大成就。安塔拉通讯社发表了一篇关于斯大林生平事迹的文章，这篇文章写道：斯大林生前已经把所有一切贡献给为被压迫人民争取解放和幸福的事业；斯大林是世界的和平战士，他教导全世界人类要痛恶战争和爱好和平。棉兰“警惕报”说：为朋友所爱戴为敌人所敬畏的斯大林，的确是一个天才的领袖。“观察报”说：必须承认，斯大林在三十年间不仅已经使苏联成为一个强大的国家，并且使他的思想影响了世界各国；事实证明了斯大林的高贵品质和伟大人格。
      巴西共产党发表告巴西工人阶级和人民书
    巴西“人民报”刊载了一篇巴西共产党全国委员会就约·维·斯大林逝世事告巴西工人阶级和人民书。
    这个公告书说：斯大林是和平和人类幸福的最伟大的保卫者。从来没有一个人像他那样得到人民的爱戴。全世界亿万人民都倾听他的声音，遵循他的英明指示。一提到他的名字就增加了胜利的信心。我们国家的工人和一切正直人们对于伟大的斯大林的逝世都感到无限悲痛。
    巴西共产党全国委员会号召人民高举和平、自由和民族独立的旗帜并加强对战争贩子的斗争。全国委员会重申它始终不渝地忠实于苏联的不可动摇的决心。全国委员会现在再度宣誓：巴西人民将永远不和社会主义国家进行战争。在争取美好前途的斗争中，人民是会胜利的。伟大的斯大林的旗帜是掌握在战无不胜的苏联共产党和它的中央委员会的手中。
      法国人民悼念斯大林同志
    好几千巴黎人民在十三日晚上参加了法苏协会追悼约·维·斯大林的集会。追悼会的主席团由马赛尔·加香、法苏协会副主席柏蒂将军和费南·格雷尼埃、法兰西妇女联盟副主席弗朗索瓦丝·勒克莱克及法国其他进步组织的代表和社会领袖组成。
    柏蒂将军在会上致悼词，着重指出了法国人民对斯大林的逝世感到无限悲痛。他说：斯大林逝世了，但是他的事业永远长存。斯大林说过，如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业坚持到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。这些话永远都会留在世界各国人民的心中。
    据“人道报”报道，当苏联出席联合国大会代表团团长维辛斯基乘船从纽约到达法国哈佛尔港时，哈佛尔劳动人民派了一个代表团向他献花，吊唁斯大林的逝世。在挚花的缎带上写着：哈佛尔人民永远怀念斯大林。
    “人道报”在十三日发表了皮埃尔·古达德的文章，颂扬苏联的和平政策。古达德说：由于斯大林和苏联人民，我们今天才没有成为希特勒帝国的奴隶。亿万人民对没有人剥削人的制度的赞美和对斯大林及苏联的感谢，是任何警察，任何威胁，任何恐怖所不能改变的。最近几天的动人事件，证明了苏维埃政权磐石般巩固，证明了全世界被压迫的劳动人民以及一切拥护和平的人和苏联友好团结的力量。
      英国人民怀念斯大林
    三月十一日伦敦“工人日报”说：它接到读者许多来信，信上表示“普通人民对斯大林逝世的纯朴而动人的悼念”。“工人日报”发表了这些来信的一部分。
    肯特郡门登斯顿城的布莱特在他的信中写道：“我们纪念斯大林，就要作更多的努力使英国人民相信，迫使邱吉尔和艾森豪威尔与苏联人民的代表会谈，以便讨论世界和平问题，是绝顶重要的。
    “让我们以缔造和平世纪这样一个不朽的功业，作为我们对一生奉献给工人阶级的斯大林的最好的纪念。”
    北伦敦一位读者的信中写道：“在人类历史里面，有谁在他的一生中能像斯大林那样令人无可怀疑地证明工人能够建立社会主义国家呢？
      “在我们纪念他的时候，让我们加强决心，加倍努力，把社会主义及和平带给全人类。”
    伦敦东南的一个读者的信中写道：“也许在这个岛国里面，还有千百万人像我一样，没有忘记这一位曾那样英勇地对抗强敌、保卫斯大林格勒的人，他所抵御的敌人要是那时回过头来拿那样大的力量对付我们，我们说不定已被打垮了。”
