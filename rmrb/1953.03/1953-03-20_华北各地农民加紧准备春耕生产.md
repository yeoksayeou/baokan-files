Farmers in North China are intensifying preparations for spring plowing, actively creating favorable conditions for this year's increased production campaign. In areas of Hebei Province with warmer climates, plowing has already begun.

This year, spring plowing preparations in North China started earlier than in any previous year. This is because the past practice of focusing on sideline production in winter has been reversed, allowing winter production to directly prepare for spring plowing. Currently, significant progress has been made in spring plowing preparations across North China. In terms of mass small-scale water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation, incomplete statistics from twenty counties in Shanxi Province, such as Zuoquan and Pingshun, show that 8,637 new wells have been dug, 2,246 old wells have been repaired, and more than 4,000 waterwheels have been loaned out since the beginning of spring. The Changzhi Special District has also planned and built 527 reservoirs and 22 dry ponds. In terms of accumulating fertilizer, Hebei, Shanxi, and other provinces have established a "Fertilizer Accumulation Blitz Month," educating farmers with examples of high yields and scientific principles, changing erroneous ideas such as "valuing fine fertilizer over coarse fertilizer," "storing ash and collecting urine won't amount to much," and "the ground is frozen and there is little firewood, so you cannot accumulate fertilizer." According to incomplete statistics from the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province and the Tongxian and Cangxian Special Districts of Hebei Province, more than 27 million cartloads, more than 5.8 million pack animal loads, and more than 56 million dan of fertilizer have been accumulated, completing about 60% of the original plan. Farmers in Suiyuan Province, who previously had poor fertilizing habits, are also planning to expand the fertilized area; Houyingzi Village in Baotou County has accumulated more than 23,000 cartloads of fertilizer, an average of two cartloads per mu. In terms of promoting production experience and scientific technology, Hebei Province plans to train 10 million technicians. Currently, in the Baoding and Tangshan Special Districts alone, more than 178,000 village cadres and peasant activists have received technical training, and key technical training stations have been established. Shanxi Province has promoted high-yield experiences for five major crops, including wheat and corn. In addition, various localities are also systematically improving soil, repairing land, adjusting seeds, purchasing livestock, and repairing agricultural implements. Some villages have already achieved sufficient fertilizer, sufficient seeds, and complete agricultural implements. People's Banks and supply and marketing cooperatives in various localities have provided active support and supplies for farmers' spring plowing preparations.

Currently, some problems still exist in spring plowing preparations in North China: First, the development of spring plowing preparations is very uneven. Wuji County in Hebei Province emphasizes the implementation of the Marriage Law as the overriding central task, neglecting spring plowing preparations; in some counties in the Tangshan Special District, half of the villages have not yet taken action. Second, in order to strive for large-scale high yields, fertilizer preparation is still insufficient. Fertilizer loans in the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province have not yet been fully distributed to the peasant masses. Leaders in some areas only seek quantity and not quality, resulting in too much soil in the manure, or poor storage of fertilizer, which reduces its effectiveness. Third, grassroots cadres issue compulsory orders because of urgent requests from superiors, making spring plowing preparations a mere formality. Cadres in the Sixth District of Licheng County, Shanxi Province, ordered farmers in villages with no conditions for digging wells to dig wells, causing waste and arousing peasant dissatisfaction. When cadres in the First District of Laishui County, Hebei Province, arranged for fertilizer accumulation, they ordered each village to dismantle their stoves within five days, which had a very bad impact. In Wuxiang County, individual grassroots cadres have made false reports in the process of setting production plans. Fourth, the campaign to tap potential and set plans has not been widely carried out. Of the more than 300,000 mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives in Shanxi Province, only 10,257 teams and cooperatives have set production plans; these plans generally have not been thoroughly explored for production potential, and are therefore too high or too low, lacking specific guarantees for implementation. Fifth, the supply of production materials such as waterwheels and walking plows is insufficient and untimely. The Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province plans to promote 5,250 waterwheels, but only 4,000 have been prepared, only 2,000 have been transported to the county, and less than 300 have been distributed to farmers; moreover, the quality of the waterwheels is low and the cost is high, and farmers are unwilling to buy them. Currently, Party and government leading organs in various parts of North China are taking effective measures to solve the above-mentioned problems.

### 华北各地农民加紧准备春耕生产

    华北各地农民加紧准备春耕生产
    华北各地农民正加紧准备春耕生产，积极为今年增产运动创造有利条件。河北省气候较暖地区已开犁耕地。
    今年华北各地春耕准备工作动手较以往任何一年都早，这是由于扭转了往年冬季以搞副业生产为主的作法，使冬季生产直接为春耕生产作好准备的结果。现在，华北各地春耕准备已取得很大成绩。在群众性的小型水利建设与水土保持工作方面，据山西省左权、平顺等二十个县不完全统计，入春后共打新井八千六百三十七眼，修好旧井二千二百四十六眼，贷放水车四千多部；长治专区并有计划地修建蓄水池五百二十七个、旱池二十二个。在攒积肥料方面，河北、山西等省规定了“积肥突击月”，用丰产实例和科学道理教育农民，转变了“重细肥轻粗肥”、“存灰积尿顶不了大事”、“地冻柴少不能积肥”等错误思想。据山西省长治专区和河北省通县、沧县等专区不完全统计，已积肥二千七百多万大车、五百八十多万驮、五千六百多万担，完成了原计划的百分之六十左右。施肥习惯较差的绥远省农民，也计划扩大施肥面积；包头县后营子村已积肥二万三千多车，平均每亩可施肥两车。在推广生产经验和科学技术方面，河北省计划训练技术员一千万人，现仅保定、唐山两专区已有十七万八千多个村干部和农民积极分子受过技术训练，并重点建立了技术传授站。山西省推广了小麦、玉米等五大作物的丰产经验。此外，各地还有计划地改良土壤、修整土地、调剂种籽、购添牲畜、修置农具等。有些村庄已经作到肥料满、种籽足、农具齐全。各地人民银行和供销合作社等对农民的春耕准备工作，做了积极的支援和供应。
    目前，华北各地春耕准备工作中仍存在一些问题：首先是春耕准备工作发展很不平衡。河北省无极县强调贯彻婚姻法是压倒一切的中心工作，不注意春耕准备工作；唐山专区有些县半数村庄还没有行动起来。其次是为了要争取大面积丰产，肥料准备仍感不足。山西省长治专区肥料贷款还没有全部发放到农民群众手里。有些地区的领导干部只求数量不求质量，结果粪里土多，或是肥料保存不好，减少了肥效。第三是基层干部因上级要求紧急而发生强迫命令，使春耕准备流于形式。山西省黎城县第六区干部在根本没有打井条件的村庄命令农民群众打井，造成浪费和引起农民不满。河北省涞水县第一区干部布置积肥时，限令各村在五天内拆完锅台，影响极坏。武乡县在订生产计划中，个别基层干部有做假报告的现象。第四是挖潜力订计划运动还没有普遍开展。山西省三十万多个互助组和农业生产合作社，仅有一万零二百五十七个组、社已订出生产计划；这些计划一般都没有经过认真挖掘生产潜力，因而偏高偏低，缺乏实现的具体保证。第五是水车、步犁等生产资料供应不足和不及时。山西省长治专区计划推广水车五千二百五十部，已备妥的只有四千部，运送到县的只有二千部，发放到农民手里还不足三百部；而且水车质量低，成本高，农民不愿意买。现在，华北各地党、政领导机关正针对上述问题，采取有效办法加以解决。
