Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 28th: On the hills near Shangpufang, northwest of Lianchuan on the Western Front, our army and enemy forces have engaged in the most intense battle since the Battle of Triangle Hill.

At approximately 8:00 PM on the night of the 23rd, a unit of our army, with the close coordination of powerful artillery fire, launched an attack on Dongshan of Shangpufang – the enemy’s position known as “Baldy Hill.” Defending this position was a reinforced company of American and Colombian troops, supported by eight tanks. Our army first captured the south peak of this ridge, which is over 200 meters high, and then seized the north peak in quick succession. The entire ridge was captured in just fifteen minutes of fighting, and all the defending enemies were annihilated except for a dozen or so who escaped.

After our army captured Dongshan of Shangpufang on the night of the 23rd, fierce fighting broke out on this hill, which had repeatedly buried large numbers of invading troops and was pockmarked with shell craters. On the very night our army captured the hill, the enemy counterattacked with a company. From the 24th onwards, they used forces ranging from a company to a battalion in five frantic counterattacks, launching thirty to forty charges each time and shelling this hill, which is only one square kilometer in area, with over 20,000 rounds of artillery fire each day. However, the enemy’s counterattacks were completely repelled by our forces, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. At 8:00 AM on the 24th, an enemy battalion attacked the hill in two directions, launching five or six consecutive charges, all of which were repelled. At approximately 4:00 PM, the enemy gathered more than two battalions of troops and deployed twelve tanks to attack us. After two hours of fierce fighting, they were once again beaten back by our heroic defending troops. In the fighting that day, our army annihilated over 700 enemies.

On the morning of the 25th, two battalions of enemy troops once again attacked "Baldy Hill," deploying up to twenty-four tanks at various times. This fierce battle lasted from morning until noon. The enemy once reached the front lines of our defensive positions, but they were defeated and retreated under the timely support of our artillery fire and the fierce counterattacks of our infantry. In the afternoon, the enemy launched a counterattack with two platoons, which was repelled by our artillery fire. In the fighting that day, our army annihilated over 380 more enemies.

From the time our army captured the hill on the 23rd to the 25th, our army annihilated over 1,400 enemies on this one hill, and destroyed ten enemy tanks.

On the same night that a unit of our army captured "Baldy Hill," two other units of our army on the Western Front captured an American army position near Deyindong adjacent to "Baldy Hill," and the North Hill of Shixian Dong, completely annihilating an enemy company headquarters and three platoons.

In the central sector, northwest and northeast of Tieyuan, our army also captured three enemy positions near Dongshan of Fengshudong, Yaoshandong, and Zhongjiashan, annihilating an American army and Rhee Syngman army platoon and a squad.

    朝鲜西线展开激烈争夺战
    我军攻占上浦防东山
    三天内歼灭敌人一千四百多名
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十八日电】　在西线涟川西北上浦防附近山岭上，我军与敌军展开自上甘岭战役以后最激烈的一次争夺战。
    二十三日夜八时许，我军某部在强大炮火密切配合下，向上浦防东山——即被敌人称为“老秃山”的敌军阵地发起攻击。据守这座阵地的是美军和哥伦比亚军的一个加强连，并配属有八辆坦克。我军首先攻下这座二百多公尺高的山岭的南山峰，然后又乘胜夺下北山峰，仅仅经历十五分钟战斗即全部占领了这座山岭，守敌除十多人逃跑外全部被歼。
    二十三日夜我军攻占上浦防东山以后，就在这座曾屡次埋葬大批侵略军，弹坑垒垒的山岭上，与敌军展开了激烈的争夺战。在我军攻占该山的当夜，敌人即用一个连向我反击，二十四日以后又使用一个连到一个营不同的兵力进行了五次疯狂反扑，先后冲锋有三、四十次，每日向这个方圆仅一平方公里的山岭炮击两万发以上。但是，敌人的反击完全被我击退，敌人并遭受了重大伤亡。二十四日上午八时，敌人的一个营分成两路向这个山岭攻击，连续冲锋五、六次都被击退。到下午四时许，敌人又纠集了两个多营的兵力，并出动十二辆坦克向我攻击，激战两个小时，再次被我英勇守军打退。这一天作战中，我军共歼敌七百多名。
    二十五日早晨，两个营的敌军再次向“老秃山”进攻，并出动坦克先后达二十四辆。这场激烈的争夺战从早晨一直持续到中午，敌人曾一度到达我军守备阵地的前沿，但在我军炮火适时的支援和步兵猛烈的反击下，敌人败退了。下午，敌人又以两个排进行反扑，被我炮火击退。这一天作战中我军又歼敌三百八十多名。
    自二十三日我军攻上山头，到二十五日止，我军在这一个山岭上已先后歼敌一千四百多名，并击毁敌军坦克十辆。
    在我军某部攻占“老秃山”的同夜，西线我军另外两支部队把与“老秃山”毗邻的德隐洞附近的一个美军阵地、和石岘洞北山攻占，全歼守敌一个连部和三个排。
    我军在中线铁原西北和东北，也攻占凤树洞东山、药山洞、中佳山附近的三处敌军阵地，歼美军及李伪军一个排和一个班。
