Editor's Note: Some readers have written to inquire about private elementary schools. We now provide a comprehensive response from the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government:

    Question: What conditions must be met to establish a private elementary school?

    Answer: To avoid increasing the burden on the masses, in principle, private elementary schools will not be developed in old liberated areas, disaster areas, ethnic minority areas, or poor villages in the future. When relatively wealthy large villages want to establish private elementary schools, they must meet the following conditions: 1. It must be based on the genuine and voluntary will of the masses, and forced orders are absolutely prohibited; 2. There must be a reliable source of funding that can sustain expenses for three to five years, and the teacher salary standards stipulated by the government must not be lowered. 3. There must be fixed and safe school buildings and necessary school equipment and teaching facilities. It must be approved by the township people's congress and reviewed and approved by the county people's government.

    Question: What are the regulations and organizational principles for private elementary schools? How should the issues of teachers and funding be resolved?

    Answer: The regulations and organizational principles of private elementary schools are the same as those of general public and private elementary schools. They must be handled in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations for Elementary Schools (Draft)," teaching plans, teaching outlines, and other relevant educational policies and decrees promulgated by the Central Ministry of Education, and use textbooks uniformly stipulated by the Central Government. People's governments at all levels must strengthen leadership over private elementary schools and help them appoint teachers and improve teaching quality. Private elementary schools must have teachers of a certain quality, who can be dispatched by the government or hired by the masses and reported to the county people's government for approval. The funding for private elementary schools should mainly be raised by the masses themselves; the people's government should provide appropriate subsidies to those who are genuinely in need.

    有关设立民办小学的几个问题
    编者按：有一些读者来信询问有关民办小学的问题，现请中央人民政府教育部综合答复如下：
    问：要设立民办小学必须具备那些条件？
    答：为了避免增加群众负担，原则上今后民办小学不在老解放区、灾区、少数民族地区以及穷苦的小村发展。比较富裕的大村要设立民办小学时，必须具备下列条件：一、必须出于群众真正的自觉自愿，绝对禁止强迫命令；二、必须有可靠的经费来源，能维持三、五年的开支，且不得降低政府规定的教师工资标准。三、必须有固定安全的校舍和必要的校具、教学设备。并须经过乡人民代表大会通过，县人民政府审查批准。
    问：民办小学的规程和组织原则怎样？师资和经费问题应如何解决？
    答：民办小学的规程和组织原则和一般公私立小学一样，必须依照中央教育部颁布的小学暂行规程草案、教学计划、教学大纲及其他有关的教育政策法令办理，并采用中央统一规定的教科书。各级人民政府对民办小学必须加强领导，帮助其任用教师，提高教学质量。民办小学必须有一定质量的教师，可由政府调派，也可由群众聘请后报县人民政府批准。民办小学的经费主要应由群众自筹；其真正有困难的，人民政府应给予适当的补助。
