The County of Daming’s Trial Agricultural Production Cooperatives: Blind Pursuit of Large-Scale Cooperatives Seriously Affects the Production Morale of the Masses

Daming County in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, continued its trial operation of agricultural production cooperatives after the autumn of last year. It developed a tendency of blindly seeking large scale and rapid progress, forcing the masses to set up more cooperatives and larger cooperatives, resulting in ideological confusion among the masses in some villages and severely undermining production.

In the spring of 1952, Daming County established 180 agricultural production cooperatives. The output of most agricultural production cooperatives was higher than that of individual farmers and mutual aid teams, but due to a lack of experience in management, some problems had not yet been resolved, so they were not very solid. The leading organs of Daming County did not fully recognize this situation and, after the autumn of last year, developed another 345 agricultural production cooperatives, including one with more than 400 households, twelve with more than 100 households, and twenty with more than 50 households.

Because the conditions for establishing large cooperatives were extremely immature, district and village cadres adopted coercive methods, forcing mutual aid teams to merge into agricultural production cooperatives or forcing the masses to directly participate in agricultural production cooperatives in order to complete their "tasks." According to the Handan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China's inspection of twenty large cooperatives: When Jing Zhanya and Yue Fengshan, two agricultural production cooperatives in Dishang Village, Fifth District of Daming County, were developing members, village cadres ordered the masses at the meeting: "There are two roads, socialism and capitalism, which one do you want to take? Those who want to take the socialist road should sign up for the cooperative on the table."

"There are only these two cooperatives in our village. You can freely choose which one to join. If you don't join this one, you join that one. You have to join one anyway." Some village cadres even grabbed the hands of farmers and put their fingerprints on the signature book. In order to establish a large cooperative with more than 100 households, the village cadres of Wenji Village said at a mass meeting: "Whoever does not join the cooperative wants to take the road of landlords, rich peasants, and the bourgeoisie." Wen Shaozhong, a Communist Party member (serving as the leader of a mutual aid team) in the village, was unwilling to join the large cooperative, and the party branch ordered him to reflect for a day. After Wen Shaozhong was forced to agree to join the cooperative, the branch asked him to mobilize the members of his mutual aid team to join the large cooperative. All the flour milling furniture and carts in the village were controlled by the Wen Fuqing Agricultural Production Cooperative, using the threat that they would not be able to use these items if they did not join the cooperative to force the masses to join the cooperative. In this way, the Wen Fuqing Agricultural Production Cooperative expanded to 150 households. In order to expand the Lian Baofu Agricultural Production Cooperative to more than 100 households, the village cadres of Rujiazhai Village in the First District used means such as "whoever does not participate will be asked to dig wells, drill wells, deliver letters, buy bean cakes, and not be allowed to borrow agricultural tools" to force the masses to join the cooperative. Serious phenomena of coercion occurred in the establishment of large cooperatives in Niangniangmiao, Laozhuang, Xiaozhai, and Sangyuan villages.

These coercive practices caused ideological confusion and low production morale among the masses. Some farmers in Rujiazhai Village said: "We will have a big canteen in the village later!" (meaning they will eat from a "big pot"). Some cooperative members said: "This is a calamity." Manure was scattered everywhere in and out of the village, and no one picked it up, and no one pulled up the cotton stalks all over the ground. The winter fertilizer accumulation movement and sideline production in Xiaolong Village were not carried out, and the cooperative members were idle all winter. Cao Zigui, a farmer in the village who was previously active in labor, slaughtered all 28 catties of his piglets after joining the agricultural production cooperative. He said: "What's the point of raising them this year!" In the past, there were 76 pigs raised in the village, but now it has been reduced to 43; in the past, there were 93 cattle fed in the village, but now it has been reduced to 53. The seven mules, four horses, and fifty head of cattle in the Xiaozhai Village Agricultural Production Cooperative were all emaciated due to a lack of grass and feed. Members of the Laozhuang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative, which had more than 50 households, had a total of ten head of cattle, one of which had already starved to death, and three others were also starving to death. The cooperative members said: "If we are allowed to withdraw from the cooperative, forty households can withdraw in one day." A part of the masses in Niangniangmiao Village had no intention of production, eating and drinking extravagantly, and drank all the wine in the village. There were more than 10,000 poplar trees on the south bank of this village, and more than 300 had been sawn down.

These serious deviations were caused by the Daming County Committee of the Communist Party of China's pursuit of formalism and desire for achievements. The Daming County Committee of the Communist Party of China once believed: "The more agricultural production cooperatives are established, and the larger they are, the faster the work can run ahead of others." Therefore, they did not look at the actual conditions, did not listen to the voices of the masses (someone reported to the county committee that the farmers said "this is a calamity," and the county committee believed that this was said by bad elements), and regarded the eagerness of a few district and village cadres as the universal demands of the masses, blindly seeking large scale and rapid progress. After the responsible comrades of the Daming County Committee of the Communist Party of China returned from attending the Hebei Provincial Mutual Aid and Cooperation Conference in early November of last year, they stipulated that Niangniangmiao Village should merge the seven cooperatives, which were automatically merged by the masses from twenty small cooperatives, into one large cooperative with more than 400 households within five days. The purpose of establishing this large cooperative was to report the experience of Daming County in running large cooperatives at the upcoming Provincial Labor Model Conference. The county committee also focused on how to run large cooperatives at the mutual aid and cooperation conference held in the second half of November. This directly fueled the blind advancement, eagerness, and coercive work style of district and village cadres.

The extremely superficial leadership style of the Daming County Committee of the Communist Party of China was also an important reason for the above-mentioned chaotic phenomena. The county committee only adopted the method of holding conferences for such important work as establishing agricultural production cooperatives. Since the autumn of last year, Daming County has held five large-scale agricultural production cooperative conferences and training classes, but has never sent anyone to go deep into key points to help farmers run cooperatives and learn specific experience in running cooperatives; nor has it organized any in-depth inspections. Therefore, many problems that occurred below could not be discovered and resolved, and even the county and district leading organs did not know how many cooperatives had been established for a long time.

The Handan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China also bears a certain responsibility for these deviations that occurred in the construction work of Daming County. After the prefectural committee learned about the situation of Daming County running large cooperatives at the end of December last year, although it conducted research and affirmed that there were problems with Daming's work of running large cooperatives, it did not send anyone to inspect. It was not until the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a circular on the problem of Daming County forcing the masses to run large cooperatives in January of this year and ordered the Handan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China to send someone to inspect that the prefectural committee sent someone to conduct the inspection. In this way, Daming County delayed for more than three months from blindly developing large cooperatives to beginning to correct deviations.

The Handan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has conducted a preliminary inspection of the twenty large cooperatives in Daming County, has put forward opinions on the handling of newly built cooperatives with more than fifty households, and has instructed the county committees under its jurisdiction to check whether there are similar situations in their counties. The prefectural committee is prepared to put the focus of leadership on Daming County, and has transferred another five cadres to cooperate with the fifty cadres of Daming County to conduct in-depth inspections in districts and villages to correct the deviations that have occurred.

    大名县在试办农业生产合作社工作中
    盲目办大社严重影响了群众生产情绪
    河北省邯郸专区大名县去年秋后继续试办农业生产合作社，发生了贪多求大的盲目冒进的偏向，强迫群众多办社办大社，造成部分村庄群众思想混乱、严重地破坏了生产的恶果。
    大名县在一九五二年春季试办了一百八十个农业生产合作社。大部分农业生产合作社的产量都比个体农民和互助组的产量高，但因缺乏经营管理的经验，若干问题还没有解决，所以并不十分巩固。大名县领导机关没有充分认识这种情况，竟在去年秋季以后，又发展了三百四十五个农业生产合作社，其中有一个四百户以上的，十二个一百户以上的，二十个五十户以上的大社。
    由于创办大社的条件极不成熟，区、村干部便采取强迫命令的方式，强迫互助组并入农业生产合作社，或强迫群众直接参加农业生产合作社，以便完成“任务”。据中共邯郸地委对二十个大社的检查：大名县五区堤上村景占雅、岳凤山两个农业生产合作社发展社员时，都有村干部在会场上命令群众说：“社会主义、资本主义两条路，看你走那一条。要走社会主义道路的就在桌子上签名入社。”
    “咱村就这两个社，你愿入那个，自由选择，不入这个就入那个，反正得入一个。”有些村干部并且拉着农民的手往签名簿上盖手印。文集村村干部为了建立一百户以上的大社，在群众大会上说：“谁要不参加社，就是想走地主、富农、资产阶级的道路。”该村共产党员（担任互助组组长）文绍忠不愿入大社，党支部叫他反省了一天。文绍忠被迫答应入社以后，支部又叫他动员他的互助组组员们入大社。该村所有的磨粉家具和大车，全部由文福庆农业生产合作社控制起来，以不入社就不能使用这些家具为名的威吓手段，强迫群众入社。文福庆农业生产合作社就这样扩大到了一百五十户。一区儒家寨村干部为了把连保福农业生产合作社扩大到一百户以上，就用“谁不参加叫谁打井、钻井、送信、买豆饼、不能借用农具”的手段，强迫群众入社。娘娘庙、老庄、小寨、桑园等村在建立大社时，都发生了严重的强迫命令现象。
    这种强迫命令的恶劣作法，造成了群众思想混乱、生产情绪低落。儒家寨村有的农民说：“以后村里要盖大饭厅啦！”（意思是要吃“大锅饭”了）有的社员说：“这是个劫数”。村里村外满地粪便没有人拾，遍地的棉柴也没有人拔。小龙村冬季的积肥运动和副业生产都没有搞起来，社员闲了一冬天。该村农民曹子贵过去积极劳动，参加农业生产合作社后，把二十八斤的小猪都杀了。他说：“这个年头养它干啥！”过去全村养猪七十六头，现在减为四十三头；过去全村喂牛九十三头，现在减为五十三头。小寨村农业生产合作社的七条骡子、四匹马、五十头耕牛，因缺草短料，都饿瘦了。老庄村一个五十多户的农业生产合作社，共有十头耕牛，已饿死了一头，还有三头也饿得快死了。社员们说：“如果允许退社，一天就能退四十户。”娘娘庙村一部分群众已无心生产，大吃大喝，把全村的酒都喝光了。这个村南堤上有一万多棵杨树，已锯倒了三百多棵。
    这些严重偏向是在中共大名县委会的锦标主义思想影响下造成的。中共大名县委会曾认为：“农业生产合作社搞得多，搞得大，工作才能跑到别人前面。”因此，他们就不看实际条件，不听群众呼声（有人向县委会反映：农民说“这是劫数”，县委会认为这是坏分子说的），把少数区村干部的急躁情绪当成了群众的普遍要求，盲目贪多求大。去年十一月初，中共大名县委会的负责同志参加河北省互助合作会议归来后，就限定娘娘庙村，在五天以内，把群众自动由二十个小社合并起来的七个社，合成一个四百多户的大社。他们办这个大社的目的，是为了在即将召开的省劳动模范大会上，报告大名县办大社的经验。县委会在十一月下半月召开的互助合作会议上，也以如何办大社为主要的讨论内容。这就直接助长了区村干部的盲目冒进的急躁情绪和强迫命令作风。
    中共大名县委会领导作风极不深入，也是造成上述混乱现象的一个重要原因。县委会对于建立农业生产合作社这样重要的工作，仅仅采用召开大会的方式。从去年秋后开始，大名县曾召开了五次大规模的农业生产合作社会议和训练班，但从没有派过一个人深入重点去帮助农民办社，吸取办社的具体经验；也没有组织过一次深入的检查。因此下面发生的许多问题都不能被发现和解决，甚至下面到底建立了多少社，县、区领导机关在很长时间内都不了解。
    中共邯郸地委对大名县在建社工作中所产生的这些偏向，也要负一定责任。地委在去年十二月底知道大名县办大社的情况以后，虽然进行了研究，并肯定大名办大社的工作有问题，但并没有派人去检查。直到今年一月中共河北省委对大名县强迫群众办大社的问题发出通报，并责成中共邯郸地委派人检查以后，地委才派了人去进行检查。这样，大名县从盲目发展大社到开始纠正偏向，一共拖延了三个多月之久。
    中共邯郸地委对大名县的二十个大社进行了初步检查，已提出了对五十户以上的新建社的处理意见，并已指示所属各县委检查本县是否有类似的情况。地委准备把领导重心放到大名县，又抽调了五个干部，配合大名县的五十个干部，到区村进行深入检查，纠正已发生的偏向。    　（冯绍兴）
