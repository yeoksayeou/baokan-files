The British People's Call for Peace and Independence
Tan Wenrui

As the consequences of the disastrous policies pursued by the British ruling clique, which betray national interests, become increasingly apparent, the British people's level of national awakening is growing day by day. The movement to strive for peace and independence is gaining wider and wider response among the masses, and the cry to "Save Britain" is constantly rising.

The British bourgeoisie, having abandoned the banner of national independence, tries every possible means to conceal and distort the essence of the national crisis facing Britain. However, more and more clear-headed British people have clearly realized their true situation. Abie Woollcott, a member of the Haim City Council, expressed the general view of the British people in a recent letter to the London "Worker's Daily." He said: "When we say 'Save Britain,' it means that we are in danger. The two most significant dangers are: economic crisis and the threat of war. The main reason for the first danger is: we are facing the threat of becoming a dependency of the United States. ... As for the second danger—war. It is obvious that the United States needs war, and only the people of Europe's refusal to act as cannon fodder can stop its recklessness."

This is one of the many readers' letters about "how to save Britain" that the "Worker's Daily" has recently received. Since the "Worker's Daily" published an editorial by its editor-in-chief, Campbell, on January 3, entitled "How Do You Save Britain?", a wide range of readers have written to express their opinions and put forward various proposals on how to save Britain from the disasters of war and economic crisis. These letters from people of all walks of life in Britain fully reflect the British people's strong desire for national independence, peace, and democracy.

Churchill and his ilk have shamelessly praised the American-launched war of aggression against Korea as "the greatest thing in the past five years," saying that this act of aggression has "the purpose of promoting peace." However, no British person will believe such nonsense. They all deeply hate this shameful war of aggression and firmly demand a peaceful solution to the Korean problem. Ivins, a miner from Talbot Port, said in his letter: "We lost our beloved son in the last world war, and my wife still grieves over it. I think the shameful Korean war must be stopped first." Hill of Leamington clearly pointed out: "Bringing the British lads back from Korea and telling the Yanks to ‘go it alone’ is the first step to saving Britain and saving peace."

It is easy to understand why the British people regard stopping the Korean War as the primary step in saving Britain. The British people have never welcomed such an unjust war that is harmful and unhelpful to them; they have fully realized whose interests the British army in Korea is protecting. People from all walks of life in Britain can appreciate the harm that the Korean War is doing to British national interests. According to the apparently reduced figures published by the British government, thousands of British youths have been killed or wounded on the Korean battlefield; Britain has to spend millions of dollars a month in military expenses to act as an accomplice. The greater harm is that the United States' conspiracy to expand its aggression at any time has the danger of dragging Britain into a new world war. This is why every time Washington clamors to expand the Korean War, it causes great anger among the British people. Even Eisenhower admitted that the British people's strong opposition to the Korean War was an "unpleasant but undeniable" "fact."

The British people know that the reason why the British ruling clique does not hesitate to sell itself to the United States is precisely to rely on the United States to maintain its colonial rule. Therefore, the British people universally demand an end to the wars and massacres carried out by Britain in colonial countries. Joseph Sins, a "Friend," put it very clearly: "If we want to save ourselves from harm, we must first stop harming our neighbors in Malaya, Kenya, and Korea."

In order to avoid new wars and economic collapse, the broad masses of the British people not only demand an end to existing wars, but also advocate a fundamental abandonment of the current policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war. The British people have realized that the British government's pursuit of the United States' war policy will drive them towards a new world war, and they all deeply feel the disasters this policy has caused to their economic life. Rising prices, reduced food rations, and an increasing number of unemployed people—the British people are repeatedly asked to tighten their belts, all of which are the evil consequences of a mad expansion of armaments. Therefore, Tang Zhi, a member of the London County Council, pointed out at the beginning of his letter: "The first step in saving Britain is to greatly reduce military spending. This will not only save money but also save manpower engaged in arms production. This will greatly improve the living standards of the British people." James Moran of Lancashire also advocated "using the manpower and resources invested in military expansion for peaceful production." Darcy of London demanded "a reduction in the military expansion plan and the use of this money for education, health institutions, and hospitals." According to the current British national budget, 44 pounds out of every 100 pounds are direct military expenses, while education expenses are only 5 pounds. The military budget for the next year reaches the astronomical figure of more than 1.63 billion pounds, while Butler has stated that he "does not intend to increase the funds for social welfare." Due to the rapid decline in the purchasing power of the pound, this means that the British people's social welfare undertakings will become more and more pitiful. The British ruling clique's disastrous policy of not spending a penny on the people's survival problems but exhausting British wealth to prepare for death will naturally be firmly opposed by the British people.

Obviously, to resolve Britain's economic crisis and the threat of war, it is first necessary to get rid of dependence on the United States. Therefore, the British people all demand an independent foreign and economic policy. Mitchell of Coraydon pointed out: "Dollar diplomacy can only lead Britain to the slaughterhouse." Tismin Puke of Cornwall more clearly advocated: "Immediately withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and similar aggressive organizations. Strive for political and economic independence from the United States. Conclude large-scale trade agreements with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries. Conclude a fifty-year treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union." Tang Zhi, a member of the London County Council, made the reasoning very clear: "The Eastern European countries, especially the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, are very willing to trade with us. We can use our industrial products to exchange for the food we need, which is much more beneficial to us than what we currently get from capitalist countries. This will bring independence to Britain and enable us to pursue a policy of seeking understanding between all countries." Recently, the British government succumbed to the United States and announced the strengthening of the embargo against China and North Korea. Even the British bourgeois "New Statesman" magazine believes that this measure "is more damaging to British commercial interests than to China." Therefore, even some members of the British Labour Party have expressed their demand to abolish this ban.

As everyone knows, large numbers of American troops are rampant and domineering in various parts of Britain, turning Britain into a conquered and occupied country. The British people feel infinite indignation at such humiliation, and anti-American sentiment is rising day by day. Deeringdale Befu, a stevedore, wrote in his letter: "The American military and political rule over our country is a deadly tumor for us. We have American air bases here. Drive the Americans out along with their war plans!" Before Befu wrote this letter, more British people had written what was in their hearts on the walls: slogans like "Yankees, go home!" can be seen everywhere in Britain.

The Communist Party of Great Britain has issued a call to save Britain's freedom and independence. More and more British people are joining this great movement to fight for an end to dollar rule, for peace, and for the independence of the British nation.

    英国人民要求和平与独立的呼声
    谭文瑞
    随着英国统治集团所推行的出卖民族利益的灾难政策的后果日益明显，英国人民的民族觉醒程度正日渐增长，争取和平与独立的运动在群众中获得愈来愈广泛的响应，“拯救英国”的声浪正在不断高涨。
    抛弃了民族独立的旗帜的英国资产阶级千方百计掩饰和歪曲英国所面临的民族危机的实质，但是愈来愈多的头脑清醒的英国人民已清楚地认识到他们的真正处境。汉姆市议会的议员亚比·吴尔贵在他最近给伦敦“工人日报”的信里，就说出了英国人民普遍的看法。他说：“当我们说‘拯救英国’，那就是说我们是在危险之中。两种显著的危险就是：经济危机和战争威胁。第一种危险的最主要的原因是：我们面临着变成为美国的附属国的威胁。……至于第二个危险——战争。很明显的，美国需要战争，只有欧洲人民拒绝充当炮灰，才能制止它的胡作非为。”
    这是“工人日报”最近所收到的关于“如何拯救英国”的许多读者来信中的一封。自从“工人日报”一月三日发表了该报总编辑坎贝尔的专论“你怎样拯救英国？”以后，广大的读者便纷纷投书表示他们的意见，提出各种各样关于如何把英国从战争和经济危机的灾难中拯救出来的主张。这些来自英国各阶层的人民的信件，充分反映了英国人民要求民族独立与和平民主的强烈情绪。
    邱吉尔之流曾厚颜无耻地把美国发动的侵朝战争恭维为“过去五年当中最伟大的事情”，说这种侵略行动有“促进和平的用途”。但是，没有一个英国人会相信这种胡说，他们都深切憎恨这个可耻的侵略战争，坚决要求和平解决朝鲜问题。泰尔波特港的矿工伊文斯在他的信里说：“我们在上次世界大战中丧失了我们的爱子，我的妻子对此还有余哀。我认为首先必须停止可耻的朝鲜战争。”立明顿的希尔明白指出：“把在朝鲜的英国小伙子们调回来，告诉美国佬，让他们‘自己干下去’，这是拯救英国和拯救和平的第一个步骤。”
    英国人民把停止朝鲜战争认为是拯救英国的首要步骤，是很容易理解的。英国人民从来就不欢迎这样一个对他们有百害而无一利的非正义战争；他们已充分地认识到在朝鲜的英国军队是在保护什么人的利益了。英国各阶层的人民都体会得到朝鲜战争对英国民族利益的危害。根据英国官方所公布的显然缩小了的数字，也已有数千英国青年人死伤在朝鲜战场；英国为了充当帮凶，每月要消耗数百万美元的军费。更大的害处是美国扩大侵略的阴谋随时都有把英国拖进新的世界战争的危险。这就是为什么当每一次华盛顿叫嚣扩大朝鲜战争的时候都引起英国人民极大愤怒的缘故。英国人民反对朝鲜战争的强烈情绪，连艾森豪威尔也承认是“不愉快的但是也是无可争辩的”“事实”。
    英国人民知道，英国的统治集团之所以不惜卖身投靠美国，正是为了要依靠美国来维持其殖民地统治，因此英国人民普遍要求结束英国在殖民地国家中进行的战争和屠杀。“教友派”的约瑟夫·辛地说得很透彻：“如果我们想拯救自己不受损害，就必须先停止损害我们马来亚、怯尼亚和朝鲜的邻人。”
    为了避免新的战争以及经济崩溃，广大的英国人民不仅要求结束现存的战争，而且主张根本放弃现行的扩军备战政策。英国人民都已认识到英国政府追随美国的战争政策将把他们驱向新的世界战争，并且莫不深深感觉到这种政策对他们经济生活所造成的灾害。物价上涨，食物配给量削减，失业者数目日增，英国人民一次又一次被要求束紧裤带，这一切都是进行疯狂扩张军备的恶果。因此，伦敦郡议会议员汤治在他的信里开头就指出：“拯救英国的第一个步骤就是大大削减军事费用。这样不仅可以节省金钱，而且可以节省从事军火生产的人力。这就可以使英国人民的生活水平大大提高。”兰开夏的詹姆·莫兰也是主张“把投在扩军中的人力物力用于和平生产”。伦敦的达尔西要求“削减扩军计划，把这些钱用于教育、卫生机构和医院上面”。根据目前的英国国家预算，每一百英镑中，有四十四英镑是直接军费，而教育费只有五英镑。下一年度的军事预算达到十六亿三千余万英镑的天文数字，而巴特勒却表示他“不拟增加社会福利的用款”。由于英镑购买力的迅速下降，这意味着英国人民的社会福利事业将愈来愈可怜了。英国统治集团这种对于人民生存问题分文不拔，为了准备死亡不惜耗尽英国资财的灾难政策，自然要遭到英国人民的坚决反对。
    显然的，要解除英国的经济危机和战争威胁，首先就要摆脱对美国的依附。因此英国人民都要求实行独立的外交和经济政策。柯莱敦的米却尔指出：“美元外交只能把英国引向屠场。”克尔恩华尔的狄士曼·普克更明确地主张：“立即退出北大西洋公约集团和类似的侵略组织。从美国手中争取政治和经济的独立。与苏联、中国和各人民民主国家订立大规模的贸易协定。与苏联缔结五十年友好条约。”伦敦郡议员汤治把道理说得很清楚：“东欧各国，特别是苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰是很愿意和我们进行贸易的。我们可以用我们的工业品去换我们所需要的粮食，这样比我们现在从资本主义国家所得到的利益大得多。这将给英国带来独立，并且使我们追循一种谋求各国谅解的政策。”最近英国政府竟屈从美国宣布对中朝两国加强禁运，连英国资产阶级的“新政治家”杂志也认为，这种措施“对于英国商业利益比对中国的损害为大”。因此甚至一些英国工党的议员也表示要求废除这项禁令。
    大家知道，大批美国驻军在英国各地横行霸道、胡作非为，把英国变成了一个被征服、被占领的国家。英国人民对于这样的屈辱感到无限的愤恨，反美情绪一天天高涨，装卸工人德灵第尔·贝孚在信里写道：“美国对我国的军事上和政治上的统治是使我们致命的毒瘤。我们这里就有美国的空军基地。把美国人连同他们的战争计划一起撵出去吧！”在贝孚写这封信以前，更多的英国人民已把他们心里的话写在墙壁上了，“美国佬，滚回去！”的标语在英国各处都可以见到。
    英国共产党已发出拯救英国的自由与独立的号召。愈来愈多的英国人民，正投身到这个伟大的运动中，为结束美元的统治、为和平和英国民族的独立而斗争。
