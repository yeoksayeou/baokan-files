    Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Bridge Temporary Bridge Project Completed on Schedule
    Workers Participating in the Bridge Construction Displayed a High Degree of Labor Enthusiasm and Creativity
    One of the key projects of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, Lanzhou to Jiayuguan section—the Yellow River Bridge temporary bridge—was completed on March 3rd. After a test run, the quality of the temporary bridge was proven to be good. Construction of this bridge began in early November last year, the bridge piers were completed in early January this year, and the bridge beams began to be erected on February 12th. Through the efforts of all the bridge erection workers, the bridge beams were quickly erected. Whether the Yellow River Bridge temporary bridge could be completed on schedule was the key to whether the construction tasks west of the Yellow River could be completed this year. Now that the temporary bridge has been built, the tools and materials needed for the construction west of the Yellow River can be transported westward via the temporary bridge, greatly facilitating the progress of the project.

    During the construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Bridge temporary bridge project, the workers of the Third Engineering Team of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creativity. They never interrupted their work in the severe cold weather of minus ten to twenty degrees Celsius. They have successively put forward more than 20 rationalization proposals. These rationalization proposals not only saved the country a large amount of construction funds, but also greatly shortened the construction period. During the erection of steel cables over the river, crane operators Tian Shulin, Li Bushan, and five others capsized their boat and were swept more than one kilometer away by the water. After being rescued by the local people, they went ashore, changed their clothes, and immediately participated in the work, finally erecting the steel cables. When sinking caissons into the Yellow River, it was very difficult to drag the caissons into the water due to their heavy weight (120 tons). The carpenters suggested making the caissons on the riverbank, the crane operators suggested lowering them in sections, and worker Xu Jiafu suggested laying steel rails on the spot, placing the caissons on the steel rails, and then using winches to pull them. These rationalization proposals ensured the smooth completion of the caisson sinking work. The pile driving work adopted the rationalization proposal of worker Chen Zhong, dividing the pile driving personnel into groups for hoisting piles, driving piles, pulling steel cables, and moving pile frames. When driving the first pile, the work for the second pile was arranged. As a result, the original rate of one pile every four hours increased to ten piles every eight hours after adopting this method. The divers worked as usual day and night in the windy and snowy weather of minus ten degrees Celsius. Every time they came out of the water, their steel helmets were full of ice slag, and their gloves turned into ice cubes, but they never flinched. (Xinhua News Agency)

    兰新铁路黄河大桥便桥工程按时完工
    参加修桥的工人发挥了高度的劳动积极性和创造性
    兰新铁路兰州至嘉峪关段重点工程之一——黄河大桥便桥已在三月三日完工。经过试车，证明便桥的质量良好。这座桥梁在去年十一月上旬开工，今年一月上旬把桥墩修好，二月十二日开始架桥梁。经全体架桥职工努力，很快就把桥梁架好了。黄河大桥便桥能否按时完成，是今年黄河以西施工任务能否完成的关键，现在便桥修好，修筑黄河以西工程所需要的工具和材料，就可以经过便桥西运，大大便利了工程的进行。（新华社）
    西北铁路干线工程局第三工程队工人在修建兰新铁路黄河大桥便桥工程中，发挥了高度的劳动积极性和创造性，他们在零下十度到二十度的严寒天气里，从未间断工作。他们先后提出合理化建议二十余件。这些合理化建议，不但为国家节省了大批建设资金，而且使工期大大缩短。起重工人田树林、李步山等七人在河上架钢丝绳时，因翻了船，被水冲了一公里多远，被当地群众救出来后，他们上岸换了衣服又立刻参加工作，终于架好了钢丝绳。往黄河里下沉箱时，因沉箱太重（一百二十吨），很难拖下水，木工建议在河边做沉箱，起重工建议分段下，工人徐家富建议就地铺钢轨，把沉箱放在钢轨上，然后用绞车绞。这些合理化建议，使下沉箱工作顺利完成。打桩工作采用了工人陈忠的合理化建议，把打桩人员分为吊桩、打桩、拉钢丝绳、移动桩架等。打第一根桩时第二根的工作就进行布置，因此，原来四小时只能打一根桩，采用这个办法后八小时就能打十根桩。潜水工人在零下十度的风雪天，不论日夜照常下水，每次从水里上来，钢帽子里积满了冰渣，手套变了冰块，也从不畏缩。    （新华社）
