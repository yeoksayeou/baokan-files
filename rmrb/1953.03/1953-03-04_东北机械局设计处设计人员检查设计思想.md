The examination of design work and the criticism of conservative and backward design ideologies in the Northeast region have expanded from the heavy industry system to other departments. On February 13th, all design personnel of the Northeast Mechanical Industry Administration Bureau's Design Department studied documents such as "Oppose Conservative and Backward Thinking in Design" and "Design Work Must Be Carried Out Correctly" (People's Daily editorial), and, combined with specific designs, examined erroneous design ideologies and work styles. Based solely on the preliminary materials examined, it is sufficient to demonstrate the serious phenomenon of neglecting design quality within the department. Some designers, when investigating original data, are afraid of trouble and unwilling to conduct thorough research. For example, when designing a certain factory, there were three sets of original data, but no one bothered to study which set was accurate, and decisions were made based on subjective estimations and guesses. When designing the Mechanical Factory No. 14, the designers did not contact the local government authorities and decided to build houses and construct water supply lines there. Only afterward was it discovered that the foundation for the houses had already been occupied by another unit. The water supply lines also could not be connected because the local government's municipal construction investment was insufficient. Sometimes, even the designers themselves doubted the accuracy of their designs, noting in the design instructions that "This design does not require absolute precision" and "For reference only." A technician responsible for checking blueprints clearly saw on a drawing that the engineer had drawn the section backward and forgotten to draw the stairs, but he did not correct it because he believed that the design engineers had already signed off on the drawing. This careless, perfunctory, and irresponsible ideological style had a very bad influence on those who had just joined the design work. They initially thought that "designing factories was not simple," but later they believed that design work was nothing more than "indicators, quotas, plus forms."

After preliminary examination, many designers have initially realized that erroneous ideological styles in engineering design have indeed caused considerable losses to the country. If they are not criticized and corrected in time, the losses to the country's large-scale construction in the future will be unimaginable. Zhang Bin, a chief engineer in the department, said: "In the past, when we did design work, we were mostly ‘responsible’ to our superiors, simply to complete the task, without considering whether problems would occur after the engineering construction was completed, which is actually a very irresponsible performance to the country and the people." During this period of study, there were still a few people who did not understand the importance of examining and summarizing design work. They had unnecessary concerns such as fear of "rework," fear of losing face, and fear of being punished. Therefore, they did not actively and positively expose the erroneous ideologies in their own design work in order to improve their design ideological level and remedy those erroneous designs that could be remedied in time, but instead wanted to avoid examining the designs they had done. Some people whose designs clearly had errors said: "There is nothing wrong with my work. Asking me to examine it and putting a few hats on myself, how can this be called seeking truth from facts!" This sentiment is obviously wrong.

After the Spring Festival, the department will enter a phase of focused examination and summarization of engineering designs. In this stage, it is necessary to deeply expose and criticize erroneous design ideologies, earnestly study advanced Soviet experience, improve design ideology, and correct work styles.

    东北机械局设计处设计人员检查设计思想
    东北地区关于设计工作的检查和对保守落后的设计思想的批判，已从重工业系统扩展至其他部门。东北机械工业管理局设计处全体设计人员在二月十三日学习“反对设计中的保守落后思想”、“必须正确地进行设计工作”（人民日报社论）等文件时，结合着具体设计，检查了错误的设计思想和工作作风。仅就初步检查出来的材料，已足以说明该处存在着严重的忽视设计质量的现象。有些设计人员调查原始资料时怕麻烦，不肯缜密地研究。如作某厂的设计时，有三套原始资料，谁也不去研究那一套是准确的，就凭主观估计、推测加以决定。设计机械十四厂时，设计人员不和当地政府机关联系，就决定在那儿盖房子，修上水道。事后才发现要盖房子的地基已被别的单位占去了。上水道也因为当地政府市政建设投资不够不能接上。有时甚至设计人员本身也怀疑自己设计的准确性，在设计说明书上注明“本设计不必要求十分周密”、“只供参考”等字样。一位负责核对图纸的技术员在一张图纸上明明看见工程师把剖面画反了，把楼梯也忘画了，但他却认为设计工程师都在图纸上签字了，就不加以纠正。这种草率马虎、敷衍塞责的思想作风，给那些刚参加设计工作的人员以极坏的影响，他们开始还觉得“设计工厂不简单”，后来却认为设计工作不过是“指标、定额再加上表格”而已。
    经过初步的检查，许多设计人员已初步认识到工程设计中的错误思想作风确实给国家造成不少损失，如果不及时地加以批判和纠正，将来给国家大规模建设造成的损失就不堪设想了。该处主管工程师张宾远说：“过去我们作设计工作多是对领导上
    ‘负责’，单纯为了完成任务，不考虑以后工程建筑完竣是否会发生问题，这实际上是对国家对人民极不负责任的表现。”在这一段学习中，还有少数人不了解检查总结设计工作的重要意义，他们有怕“返工”、怕丢面子以及怕受处分等不必要的顾虑，因而就不是主动地积极地揭发自己设计工作中的错误思想，以提高自己设计思想水平，补救那些可以及时补救的错误设计，而是想躲避检查自己所做的设计。有的人作的设计明明有错误，但却说：
    “我的工作就没有什么毛病，叫我检查，给自己戴上几顶帽子，这怎么能说是实事求是呢！”这种情绪显然是错误的。
    春节以后，该处即进入重点检查总结工程设计的阶段。在这一阶段，要深入地揭发与批判错误的设计思想，认真学习苏联先进经验，提高设计思想，端正工作作风。
