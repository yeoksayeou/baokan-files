Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 23rd: The state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company (hereinafter referred to as Anshan Iron and Steel) has revised its 1953 labor plan in accordance with the advanced labor indicators stipulated by the state. The new plan reduces the workforce by 5,889 people compared to the original plan, and labor productivity increases by 5.35%. The revised labor plan will save the state 52.4 billion yuan in wage expenditure and over 45,000 square meters of dormitory construction investment throughout the year.

In the initial production and labor plan drafted by Anshan Iron and Steel this year, although the total output value increased by 27.29% compared to last year, the number of production personnel increased significantly. As a result, labor productivity was actually 1.3% lower than last year. After the company leadership mobilized all employees to improve labor organization and revise the labor plan, as of the end of February, the factories and mines had already reduced the number of production personnel by 2,367. These personnel have begun to study separately, some are preparing to support basic construction, and some are preparing to participate in the large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel pipe plant that will start production in the second half of the year.

The results of various production plants and mines in improving labor organization have not only improved labor productivity, but also tapped production potential and improved production management. According to statistics, in the process of improving labor organization in January and February, employees of various factories and mines have put forward 4,500 reasonable suggestions. The 97 rationalization proposals adopted by the first ore-dressing section of the ore-dressing plant alone can create 10 billion yuan of wealth for the country throughout the year. After technical measurement, the magnesia brick workshop of the refractory material plant reduced the number of planned personnel by 19%, and the output can still increase by 30%. In the past, the labor organization of the steel rolling section of the primary rolling mill was unreasonable, and the workers were very busy and tired. Now a rotation system has been implemented, and there are still surplus personnel. The primary rolling reduced the number of maintenance workers by 40%, and the work is done even better than before. The ore-dressing plant has established a regular maintenance and contracted maintenance system, which has provided a good guarantee for reducing accidents, prolonging equipment life, improving equipment utilization, and improving output and quality.

    鞍钢修订一九五三年的劳动计划
    发动职工改善劳动组织提高了劳动生产率
    【新华社沈阳二十三日电】国营鞍山钢铁公司（简称鞍钢）按照国家规定的先进劳动指标，修订了一九五三年的劳动计划。新的计划比原计划减少了五千八百八十九人，劳动生产率提高了百分之五点三五。经过修订的劳动计划，全年可为国家节省工资开支五百二十四亿元和四万五千多平方公尺的宿舍建设投资。
    鞍钢在今年第一次编拟的生产劳动计划中，生产总值比去年虽然增加了百分之二十七点二九，但生产人员却大大增加。因此劳动生产率反比去年降低了百分之一点三。经过公司领导方面发动全体职工改善劳动组织，修订劳动计划后，到二月底止，各厂矿已经从生产人员中减少了二千三百六十七人。这些人员已开始分别进行学习，有些准备支援基本建设，有些准备参加将在下半年开工生产的大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂。
    各生产厂矿改善劳动组织的结果，不但提高了劳动生产率，而且也挖掘了生产潜力，改善了生产管理。据统计，在一、二月份改善劳动组织中，各厂矿职工已提出四千五百件合理化建议。仅选矿厂一选工段已被采纳的九十七件合理化建议，全年可为国家创造一百亿元的财富。耐火材料厂镁砖车间经过技术测定，减少了原计划人数的百分之十九，产量还能增加百分之三十。初轧厂轧钢工段，过去劳动组织不合理，工人很忙累，现在实行了轮休制，还有多余人员。初轧把检修工人减少了百分之四十，工作比从前做得还好。选矿厂建立了定期检修与包修制，对减免事故，延长设备寿命，提高设备利用率，和提高产量、质量都有了很好的保证。
