Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 28th. The "Rodong Sinmun" newspaper published an editorial on the 25th regarding the confessions of American prisoners of war, Xu Weibuer and Blair.

The editorial pointed out: The confessions of these American prisoners of war have once again specifically proven that the American aggressors, disregarding the serious warnings of peace-loving people around the world, are wantonly trampling on international regulations and human morality, continuing to wage germ warfare against Korea and China, and are developing germ warfare from the experimental stage to the operational stage, plotting to use bacteriological weapons on an even larger scale.

However, the Korean people, having accumulated rich experience in the anti-bacterial warfare struggle, are not afraid of germ warfare of any scale by American imperialism. The Korean people have made full deployments to crush the enemy's germ warfare atrocities anytime, anywhere. At the same time, the Korean people have also arranged thorough countermeasures against Eisenhower's so-called "new offensive," which is closely related to the enemy's attempt to expand germ warfare.

The editorial concluded: The continuation and expansion of the U.S. imperialist germ warfare crimes can only make the Korean people's spirit of revenge boil even more and make the angry voices of peace-loving people around the world rise even higher. The Korean people, together with the peace-loving people of the world, must give the heinous criminals a solemn final judgment.

    朝“劳动新闻”发表社论斥美国细菌战罪行
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】“劳动新闻”报二十五日就美俘许威布尔和布莱的供词发表社论。
    社论指出：美俘的这些供词已再次具体地证明：美国侵略者不顾世界爱好和平人民的严重警告，在横暴地蹂躏着国际法规和人类道德，对朝鲜和中国继续进行细菌战，并且正在把细菌战由实验阶段发展到作战的行动阶段，策划着更大规模地使用细菌武器。
    但是，积累了丰富的反细菌战斗争经验的朝鲜人民决不惧怕美帝国主义任何规模的细菌战。朝鲜人民已作了充分的部署，准备随时随地粉碎敌人的细菌战暴行。同时，朝鲜人民对于和敌人扩大细菌战的企图有密切关联的艾森豪威尔叫嚣的所谓“新攻势”，也已安排了周密的对策。
    社论最后说：美帝国主义细菌战罪行的继续和扩大只能使朝鲜人民的复仇斗志更加沸腾，使世界爱好和平的人民的愤怒呼声更加高涨。朝鲜人民和世界爱好和平的人民一道，一定要对罪大恶极的罪犯作严正的最后审判。
