    Stalin and Gorky
    By M. Zuo Chengliang, Deputy Director of the Department of Linguistics, Moscow State University, USSR
    Editor's Note: Today is the 85th anniversary of the birth of Maxim Gorky. This article was written for our newspaper by Comrade M. Zuo Chengliang, Deputy Director of the Department of Linguistics of Moscow State University, who sincerely describes this revolutionary writer's deep love for the great Comrade Stalin.
    The Soviet people commemorate the 85th anniversary of the birth of the great proletarian writer Gorky in these sorrowful days when humanity mourns the premature death of the great Stalin.
    Gorky's great activities were carried out with the constant support and help of Comrade Stalin. Just as he did for all Soviet writers and progressive writers around the world, Stalin inspired Gorky to engage in his great creative work.
    Gorky began his writing career in the homeland of the great Stalin—Georgia. Here, Gorky wrote his first short story, "Makar Chudra," and the ideas for the myth of "Danko" and the fairy tale "The Girl and Death" were also born here. In some railway repair shops in Tiflis, known for its revolutionary traditions, Gorky received revolutionary training in this glorious school. Comrade Stalin's revolutionary activities unfolded in these railway repair shops, and he called the workers of these factories his first teachers.
    Gorky first learned about Stalin from Lenin, who mentioned in a letter to Gorky in 1913 this "extraordinary Georgian" who wrote an outstanding Marxist work on the national question. Gorky, following Lenin's advice, studied Comrade Stalin's work.
    Gorky was an enthusiastic promoter of Lenin and Stalin's nationality policy. In the era of Soviet power, he praised the fact that "people who speak different languages can still understand each other, because there are some words that sound the same in any language, and those words are 'Lenin, Stalin, Soviet'."
    Comrade Stalin gave high praise to Gorky—the artist and political commentator. In some speeches in 1905, Comrade Stalin had already applied the artistic images from his works. The leaflet "To All Workers" written by J.V. Stalin ended with a vigorous and optimistic call that so clearly recalled Gorky's "Song of the Petrel." "Let the thunder sound more violently, let the storm break out more fiercely! The moment of victory is near!" In another leaflet by Stalin, "We and Tears?!," the image and idea of "Song of the Falcon" was also used: developing the idea of "the great courage of brave men," and scorning and angrily cursing the Mensheviks who called on the masses to withdraw from the struggle and spread discouragement and pessimism. His revolutionary romanticism attracted Stalin.
    Comrade Stalin loved and respected Gorky, and he frankly and sternly pointed out the mistakes Gorky made in 1917. Stalin warned Gorky against the danger of deviating from the correct path of the revolution, pointing out the danger of Gorky's association with the "panic-stricken neurotics" of the "New Life" magazine, because they could divert the writer from the tasks of the proletarian revolution. Gorky listened attentively to this criticism and returned to the path of the October Revolution and the path of his party. The criticism of Gorky's mistakes by Lenin and Stalin gave the writer invaluable ideological help, helping him to get rid of the temporary influence of hostile ideas, saving the talented artist, and consolidating his Marxist-Leninist position.
    In his letter to Gorky on January 17, 1930, Stalin's explanation of the issues of criticism and self-criticism, and of youth, enabled the writer to deeply and correctly understand the significance of criticism and self-criticism and truthfully reflect it in the artistic images of the play "Somov and Others."
    In 1931, Comrade Stalin listened to Gorky recite the fairy tale "The Girl and Death," created in Georgia in 1892. Gorky hoped to hear J.V. Stalin's comments on this early work, in which Gorky's revolutionary romantic optimism was reflected. Comrade Stalin wrote about this fairy tale: "This is more powerful than Goethe's 'Faust' (love triumphs over death)." Stalin saw the philosophical ideas of early Gorky, which were far superior to the philosophy of Goethe's "Faust." Stalin emphasized that Gorky brought to world literature a new philosophical understanding of life, reflecting the rise of the most revolutionary class—the proletariat—on the historical stage. In contrast to Goethe's pessimistic tone (Gorky wrote: "This despair is not absent in Goethe's 'Faust'"), Gorky's creations had a courageous, optimistic tone and a positive attitude towards life. Gorky's romantic ideas stood up against the reactionary vulgar literature filled with pessimism and disbelief in the power of man and the future of man, and he used the philosophy of heroic struggle for the ideals of a bright future to fight against these ideas and emotions.
    Gorky excitedly and happily saw the great achievements of the Soviet system in liberating the creativity of the masses. This creativity, under the leadership of Stalin, realized the program of building socialism that he had ingeniously formulated.
    In his article "On Culture," Gorky pointed out how much the Soviet people, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, had created in less than twenty years: "All this shows the talent of the Soviet people, their heroism of labor, this shows that in our country labor has become an art, this shows that the proletariat of the Union of Socialist Republics, led by Lenin's doctrine and the Party, and by the inexhaustible and growing energy of Joseph Stalin, is creating a new culture and a new history of laboring humanity." Earlier (in 1931), Gorky pointed out in a letter to the workers of the Magnitogorsk plant that the huge task that Stalin had put forward to the Soviet people was "something that no one and no nation in the world had ever proposed at any time." During this period, the theme of praising human reason, praising liberated labor, praising the transformation of the social system and nature itself by the Soviet people, and praising mankind's ability to create great and wonderful things, was strengthened in Gorky's creations. Gorky, in some of his speeches, used all his strength to promote Stalin's doctrine on the power of thought and transformation, and on the creative activity of the masses. Gorky saw in Stalin—the great successor to Lenin's doctrine—the "keen wisdom of a great theorist" and the intuition of a "true revolutionary." Gorky regarded Stalin as "Lenin's energy reborn." The powerful ideas of the Soviet people and the possibility of building socialism and communism in the Soviet Union were established in Gorky's creations. Gorky's essay "On the New Man" was a response to J.V. Stalin's speech at the First Stakhanovite Workers' Conference. His essay praised the "fiery outbreak of mass talent, the outbreak evoked by the great achievements of labor, the significance of labor culture and the power of labor." The glorification of human labor, which was always a characteristic of Gorky's works, reached its peak in the Soviet era.
    Gorky was proud that labor in the Soviet Union had become a necessity, a joy, a matter of honor and devotion.
    Comrade Stalin's ideological and theoretical help to Gorky and all Soviet literature was particularly manifested in solving the new artistic method of Soviet art and literature—the method of socialist realism. The completion of this task was entirely led and guided by the great Stalin. Gorky beautifully developed his ideas in his essays and speeches on this issue.
    Gorky was a fighter against fascism and the "Yellow Devil City"—American imperialism. Under the influence of Comrade Stalin, he became an exposer of imperialist reactionaries and bourgeois ideas. In one of his political commentaries, while exposing the bestial nature of imperialism and fascism, Gorky pointed out the great strength of the Soviet state and people and the brilliance of the people's leader. Gorky wrote in 1935: "We are already a people with socialist culture, and we are no longer empty-handed. Our weapon is not only in the hands of the intelligent and outstanding Red Army, but also in the brilliant and world-saving doctrine of Lenin and Stalin."
    Gorky believed that any military attack by imperialist robbers on the Soviet Union would lead to their inevitable defeat. He wrote: "The enemy is doomed to perish, and the more frantic and despicable his violent thirst for blood becomes, the faster he will perish."
    Gorky educated Soviet writers to treat the works of artists with the most responsible spirit and to praise the Soviet people's deep love for Comrade Stalin. Gorky told Soviet writers: "We are speaking in a country illuminated by the genius of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, and the iron will of Joseph Stalin is working tirelessly here. This is what we should keep in mind in our work and in all our speeches before the world." Regarding Gorky's love for Stalin, the writer Nikulin has a vivid and meaningful account in his memoirs: "Gorky would love people and love them with loyal and tender love.
    "It is no exaggeration to say that Gorky loved Joseph Vissarionovich with this deep and tender love. He said this name with excitement, and spoke with excitement and conviction about the work Stalin was doing for the country and for the people. Stalin talked a lot about the tasks of literature, and Gorky, while listening to him, looked at us with pleasant and shining eyes, as if to let us and him be happy for these just and exceptionally moving words. It should be seen how respectful, tender, and warm Stalin looked at Gorky—the first among Soviet writers."
    To create a literary portrait of Comrade Stalin, to depict the image of the leader with the same love with which he depicted the image of the brilliant Lenin, was Gorky's dream that he cherished day and night. As early as 1934, Gorky had said to Ivanov: "We should write about Stalin. It is difficult to write about a person who surprises us intellectually, but artists have no right to say: 'I am surprised, so I cannot start to draw this portrait.' Respect and praise are natural, and the artist is also natural. The artist should pick up a pen and write." Gorky did not have time to create an artistic portrait of his dearest leader and friend. But his words about Stalin reveal to us those deepest feelings and thoughts—the feelings and thoughts that filled his heart when the writer thought of this greatest man of his time. In Gorky's personal files, there are materials about the life and activities of Comrade Stalin. Gorky collected a lot of materials, did preparatory work, and creatively thought about the structure and content of future works. Many notes made by the writer in the materials he collected about his beloved leader prove this.
    Gorky was exceptionally amazed by the greatness of Stalin's plans and intentions. He praised Stalin's accomplishments and the greatness of the labor that transformed the life of our huge country. The leader's energy and his indomitable will are immense. Gorky talked about Comrade Stalin's inexhaustible and ever-growing energy, and considered him to be a person with a strong organizational power. Gorky also talked about Stalin's tireless work.
    The image of Comrade Stalin is depicted most completely in Gorky's essay "The Truth of Socialism." This essay was written two years before the writer's death. In this essay, Gorky pointed out the characteristics of Comrade Stalin: "Joseph Stalin has profoundly understood the energy and courage of his mentor and comrade, and for ten years has worthily replaced him as the leader of the Party in this most difficult position. Stalin's significance in the world is constantly and rapidly growing. He understands more deeply than all the rest that only the true and pure proletarian energy discovered and inspired by Lenin is the true and unwavering revolutionary creative energy. The outstanding organizational will and profound mind of the great theorist, the courage of a talented master, the intuition of a true revolutionary—he will meticulously analyze the complex qualities of people, cultivate the excellent qualities among them, and ruthlessly fight against those things that hinder their development to the highest point. People put him in Lenin's position. The proletariat of the Soviet Union is happy to have a leader like Stalin..."
    Gorky emphasized his trust in Stalin's cause. Gorky taught the Soviet people to regard the great Stalin as the successor to Lenin's cause and doctrine. Gorky said of this leader of the Party, who served as a faithful helmsman, that he "excellently overcame the deviation from the correct course, and quickly stopped the various 'dizzy spells' of the commander of the Party's ship."
    Gorky valued the ruthlessness of the immortal Stalin towards the enemies of the people and his sharp political vigilance: "The wise and sharp leadership of Lenin's Central Committee is headed by people who are truly worthy of the love of the workers and peasants." Stalin's solid connection with ordinary people, his sensitive observation of a person, his respect for the wisdom and experience of ordinary people—this characteristic of his could not escape the sharp and observant eyes of this great artist. Gorky wrote in 1934: In the Soviet Union, "every honest worker and collective farmer can have a comrade-like exchange directly with his leader. At any time in the world, no one praised by history as 'leader of the people' has ever talked about, or dared and could not talk about, the power of the workers in this way: 'We teach you, and at the same time we learn from you.' Joseph Stalin said this sentence, which is a huge, unprecedented, and truly revolutionary truth. This truth is the power that creates the amazing outbreak of creative movement called Stakhanov."
    Gorky never left the Party and the Party's leaders, Lenin and Stalin. The servants of the imperialist bourgeoisie understood the importance of Gorky's ideological, artistic, and political significance as a fighter for communism, and they killed the great writer of our time through their agents. The Soviet people will always remember Gorky with love. In the harsh days of the Great Patriotic War, Comrade Stalin quoted Gorky's words in his order to the Soviet armed forces: "You must remember the words of the great Russian writer Maxim Gorky: 'If the enemy does not surrender, destroy it.'" Gorky completed his glorious combat path, he was an artist and fighter against all enemies of communism, he was the best and most friendly friend of the working people of the world, and he was a comrade-in-arms of the great Stalin. Gorky's life and creations inspire Soviet writers and progressive writers around the world to complete the legacy of the great Stalin—the best friend and father of all progressive humanity.

    斯大林和高尔基
    苏联国立莫斯科大学语言学系副主任  姆·佐竹梁
    编者按：今天是马克西姆·高尔基诞生八十五周年纪念日。本文是苏联国立莫斯科大学语言学系副主任姆·佐竹梁同志特为本报写的，他真切地描述了这位革命文豪对伟大的斯大林同志的深刻的爱。
    苏联人民在人类悲悼伟大斯大林过早去世的沉痛的日子里，来纪念伟大的无产阶级作家高尔基诞生的八十五周年。
    高尔基的巨大活动是在斯大林同志的经常支持和帮助下展开的。斯大林正像对全体苏联作家和全世界的进步作家一样，他鼓舞了高尔基从事伟大的创作事业。
    高尔基开始走上作家的创作道路，是在伟大的斯大林的故乡——格鲁吉亚。在这里，高尔基写了第一篇短篇小说“马加尔周达”，关于“丹柯”的神话和童话“少女和死神”的构思，也是在这里产生的。高尔基在以革命传统而驰名的梯弗里斯的一些铁路修理厂里，受过了这个光荣学校的革命锻炼。斯大林同志的革命活动就是在这些铁路修理厂里展开的，他曾把这些工厂的工人称为自己最初的老师。
    高尔基最初是从列宁那里知道斯大林的，列宁在一九一三年给高尔基的信中，提到了这位著作关于民族问题的卓越的马克思主义著作的“非凡的格鲁吉亚人”。高尔基按照列宁的劝告，研究了斯大林同志的这部著作。
    高尔基是列宁、斯大林的民族政策的热心的宣传者。在苏维埃政权的年代，他颂扬过这一点，即：“语言不同的人们仍可以彼此了解，因为有一些字是任何语言都发出同样声音的，这些字就是‘列宁、斯大林、苏维埃’。”
    斯大林同志对高尔基——艺术家和政论家——曾予以高度的评价。斯大林同志在一九○五年的一些演说中，就已应用了他的作品中的艺术形象。约·维·斯大林所写的“告全体工人书”传单，是以富有朝气的乐观的号召收尾的，这一号召使人这样清晰地回忆起高尔基的“海燕之歌”来。“让雷声来得更厉害吧，让暴风雨爆发得更厉害吧！胜利的时刻已经临近了！”在斯大林的另一个传单“我们和眼泪？！”中也利用了“鹰之歌”的形象和思想：发展了“勇敢人的伟大勇敢”思想，以轻视和愤怒咒骂了号召群众脱离斗争、传播气馁和悲观主义的孟什维克。他的革命的浪漫主义吸引了斯大林。
    斯大林同志热爱和尊敬高尔基，他直爽地和严厉地指出高尔基在一九一七年所犯的错误，斯大林警告高尔基要反对离开革命的正确道路的危险，指出高尔基与“新生活”杂志的“惊惶万状的神经衰弱者们”接近的危险，因为他们是可能使作家离开无产阶级革命任务的。高尔基注意地听取了这个批评，回到了十月革命的道路和自己的党的道路。列宁和斯大林对高尔基的错误的批评，给了作家难以估计的思想上的帮助，帮助他摆脱了敌对思想的暂时影响，挽救了天才的艺术家，并巩固了他的马克思列宁主义的立场。
    斯大林在一九三○年一月十七日给高尔基的信中关于批评与自我批评问题，关于青年等问题的解释，使作家深刻地和正确地明白了批评与自我批评的意义，并把它真实地反映在戏剧“索莫夫和其他”的艺术形象中。
    一九三一年，斯大林同志在高尔基那里听了他朗诵一八九二年在格鲁吉亚创作的童话“少女和死神”。高尔基希望听到约·维·斯大林关于这个早期作品的评论，在这个作品中，反映出高尔基的革命浪漫主义的乐观思想。斯大林同志关于这个童话曾写道：“这个比歌德的‘浮士德’（爱战胜死）更为有力。”斯大林看到了早期高尔基的哲学思想，它较歌德的“浮士德”的哲学优越得多。斯大林曾强调指出，高尔基给世界文学带来了生活的新的哲学理解，反映出最革命的阶级——无产阶级登上历史舞台。与歌德的悲观的调子相对立（高尔基写道：“这种绝望情绪在歌德的‘浮士德’中不是没有的”），高尔基的创作有着勇敢的、乐观的声调和对生活的积极态度。高尔基的浪漫主义思想，挺身反对充满悲观主义、不相信人的力量和人的未来的反动的庸俗文学，他以为争取光辉未来的理想的英勇斗争哲学来对抗这些思想和情绪。
    高尔基兴奋地、愉快地看到解放了群众的创造力的苏维埃制度的伟大成就。这种创造力在斯大林的领导下，实现了为他所天才地制订的建设社会主义的纲领。
    高尔基在“论文化”一文中曾指出，苏联人民在斯大林同志的领导下，在不到二十年的时期内创建了多么多的东西：“这一切说明苏联人民的才干、他们的劳动英雄主义，这说明在我国劳动已成为一种艺术，这说明由列宁的学说和党、由约瑟夫·斯大林的无尽藏的、增长着的精力所领导的社会主义共和国联盟的无产阶级，正在创造新文化和劳动人类的新历史”。更早一些（一九三一年），高尔基在给马格尼托制造厂的工人们的信中指出了：斯大林向苏联人民提出来的巨大任务，是“世界上任何时候任何人和任何一个民族都未曾提出过的。”在这个时期，赞美人类理智、赞美被解放了的劳动的主题，赞美苏联人对社会制度和大自然本身的改造，赞美人类创造伟大的和绝妙的事物的才能的主题，在高尔基的创作中加强起来。高尔基在自己的一些演说中以全力来宣传斯大林关于思想和改造力量、关于群众创造性的活动的学说。高尔基在斯大林——列宁学说的伟大继承人——的身上，看见“伟大理论家的敏锐智慧”和“真正革命家的”直觉。高尔基认为斯大林是“列宁的精力再生的一个人”。苏联人的强有力的思想、在苏联建设社会主义和共产主义的可能性，在高尔基的创作中都确立起来。高尔基的论文“论新人”就是约·维·斯大林在第一次斯塔哈诺夫工作者会议上的演说的反应。他的这篇论文歌颂了“群众才能的火焰般的爆发，劳动的巨大成就所唤起的爆发，劳动文化的意义和劳动的力量。”永远是高尔基的作品特点的人类劳动的美化，在苏维埃时代达到了全盛繁荣。
    高尔基因劳动在苏联成为需要、快乐、光荣和忠勇的事情而感到骄傲。
    斯大林同志对高尔基和全苏联文学的思想上和理论上的帮助，特别表现在解决苏联艺术和文学的新艺术方法——社会主义的现实主义的方法方面。这个任务的完成，完全是伟大的斯大林所领导和指导的。高尔基在关于这个问题的论文和发言中，把他的思想美妙地发展了。
    高尔基是反对法西斯主义和“黄鬼城”——美帝国主义——的战士。他在斯大林同志的影响下成为一个帝国主义反动派和资产阶级思想的揭露者。高尔基在他的一篇政论中，揭穿帝国主义和法西斯主义的野兽本质时，指出苏维埃国家和人民的伟大力量及人民领袖的英明。高尔基在一九三五年写道：“我们已是具有社会主义文化的人民，同时已不是赤手空拳的了。我们的武器不仅握在聪慧的、卓越的红军手中，它还在英明的、拯救全世界的列宁、斯大林的学说中。”
    高尔基相信，帝国主义强盗对苏联的任何军事进攻，都会导致他们不可避免的溃败。他写道：“敌人是注定要灭亡的，他对血的猛烈渴求愈是疯狂和卑鄙，他就灭亡得愈快。”
    高尔基教育苏联作家要以最负责的精神对待艺术家的作品，赞美苏联人对斯大林同志的深爱。高尔基向苏联作家说过：“我们是在乌拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁的天才所照耀的国家中说话，约瑟夫·斯大林的钢铁般的意志在这儿不知疲倦地工作着。这就是我们在工作中和在世界面前的全部发言中所应该牢记在心的。”关于高尔基对斯大林的爱，作家尼古林在他的回忆录中有鲜明的和意味深长的叙述： “高尔基会爱人们并且是以忠诚的和温柔的爱情来爱他们。
    “可以毫不夸大地说，高尔基正是以这种深刻的和温柔的爱情爱约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇。他激动地说着这个名字，激动地和确信地谈到斯大林为国家、为人民所做的工作。斯大林谈了许多关于文学的任务，高尔基一边听着他，一边以愉快的、光辉的眼光看着我们，好像是让我们和他一同来为这些公正的和异常动人的话感到快乐。应该看出，斯大林是多么尊敬、温柔和温暖地看着高尔基——苏联文学家中的第一人。”
    创作斯大林同志的文学上的肖像，以他描绘天才的列宁的形象的那种热爱来描绘领袖的形象，是高尔基朝夕想望和珍爱的梦想。还在一九三四年，高尔基曾向伊凡诺夫说过：“应该写关于斯大林的事。关于一个在智力上使我们惊奇的人是很难写的，但是艺术家没有权利说：‘我感到惊奇，因此不能着手描绘这个肖像。’崇敬和颂扬是自然而然的，而艺术家也是自然而然的。艺术家应该拿起笔来写。”高尔基没有来得及创造最亲爱的领袖和朋友的艺术肖像。但是他关于斯大林的话，给我们揭示出那些最深刻的感情和思想——当作家想到同时代中这位最伟大的人时，他的心中所充满的感情和思想。在高尔基个人的档案中，存有关于斯大林同志的生活和活动的材料。高尔基收集了许多材料，做了准备工作，创造性地思考了未来著作的结构和内容。作家在他所收集的关于亲爱的领袖的材料中所做的许多札记，就证明了这一点。
    斯大林的计划和意图的宏大，使高尔基感到异常惊奇。他赞扬斯大林所完成的功绩和改造我们巨大国家的生活的劳动的伟大。领袖的精力和他不屈不挠的意志是巨大的。高尔基谈到斯大林同志的无穷尽的、时时增长着的精力，并认为他是具有强有力的组织力的人，高尔基还谈到斯大林的不知疲倦的工作。
    斯大林同志的形象，在高尔基的论文“社会主义的真理”中描绘得最完全。这篇论文是作家逝世前两年所写的。在这篇论文中，高尔基曾这样指出斯大林同志的特点：“约瑟夫·斯大林最深刻地领会了自己的导师和同志的精力和勇敢，十年来无愧地代替他担任党的领袖这一最困难的职位。斯大林的意义在世界上不断地、愈来愈快地增长着。他比所有其余的人都更深刻地了解：只有为列宁所发现和鼓舞的真正的和纯粹的无产阶级的精力，才是真正的和坚定不移的革命创造性的精力。伟大的理论家的卓越组织意志和深湛的头脑，有才干的主人的勇敢，真正革命家的直觉——他会细致地分析人们的复杂品质，培养其中优秀的品质，无情地与那些阻碍其发展到最高点的东西做斗争。人们把他放在列宁的地位。苏联的无产阶级因为有像斯大林这样的领袖而感到幸福……”。
    高尔基曾着重指出他对斯大林事业的信赖。高尔基教导苏联人把伟大的斯大林看作列宁的事业和学说的继承者。高尔基谈到这个做为忠实的舵手的党的领袖时说，他“出色地克服了脱离正确方针的偏向，并很快地制止住党的船只的指挥者的各种‘昏眩’”。
    高尔基是重视不朽的斯大林的那种对人民敌人的无情和他的锐敏的政治警惕性的：“列宁的中央委员会的英明的、锐敏的领导，是以真正不愧为工农群众热爱的人为首的。”斯大林与普通人的巩固联系、他对一个人的敏感的观察，对普通人的智慧和经验的崇敬——他的这一个特点也没有能逃过这位伟大的艺术家的锐敏的和善于观察的眼睛。高尔基在一九三四年曾写道：在苏联，“每个正直的工人和集体农民都可能直接与他的领袖有同志般的来往。世界上任何时候，任何一个为历史所称赞为‘人民领袖’的人，都没有谈过、也都不敢和不能这样谈到工人的力量：‘我们教导你们，同时我们也向你们学习’。约瑟夫·斯大林说过这句话，这是巨大的、空前未有的、真正革命的真理。这个真理就是创造名叫斯塔哈诺夫的创造性运动的那个使人惊奇的爆发的力量。”
    高尔基没有离开过党以及党的领袖列宁和斯大林。帝国主义资产阶级的奴仆们是明白作为争取共产主义的战士的高尔基的思想、艺术和政治意义的重要性，他们通过自己的代理人杀害了我们时代的伟大作家。苏联人永远满怀热爱地想起高尔基。在伟大卫国战争的严峻的日子里，斯大林同志在给苏联武装力量的命令中曾引用了高尔基的话：“你们要记住伟大的俄国作家马克西姆·高尔基的话：‘如果敌人不投降，就消灭它。’”高尔基完成了自己的光荣战斗道路，他是一个反对共产主义一切敌人的艺术家和战士，他是全世界劳动人民最好的和最友善的朋友，是伟大斯大林的战友。高尔基的生活和创作，鼓舞着苏联作家和全世界的进步作家去完成伟大斯大林——全体进步人类的最好的朋友和父亲——的遗训。（君强、刘竞合译）（附图片）
