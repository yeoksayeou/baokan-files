    Supply System Management Thought is the Great Enemy of Our Implementation of Economic Accounting System
    Fan Taozhai, Manager of the Southwest District Company of China National Department Store
    (I)
    The Southwest District Department Store system adopted the policy of pilot preparation and full implementation for the establishment of procurement supply wholesale stations and the implementation of the economic accounting system. Starting from November last year, the Chongqing Station was first prepared, systems were drafted, experience was gained, and it was promoted throughout the district. In mid-to-late December last year, the department store companies of Southwest provinces held financial accounting meetings and supply business meetings respectively to review the work. It was discovered that the local companies, due to poor management and the influence of the long-term large-scale recall system and supply system management thinking, had resulted in serious overstocking of goods and a large waste of funds. Based on reasonable needs, the local companies initially verified the funds of each wholesale station and state-owned department store, signed supply contracts, drafted various systems, and determined various quotas. The Southwest District Company also decided to set up nine procurement and supply wholesale stations and open 141 state-owned department stores. Each wholesale station and store officially opened on January 1 this year and began to implement the economic accounting system. The wholesale stations and stores are no longer asking higher authorities for goods and personnel to complete tasks, but are all using their brains and emphasizing planning. Preliminary asset verification results from wholesale stations and stores in Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, and Chongqing showed that funds could be saved by more than 50% compared to the past, personnel could be reduced by 28.64%, capital turnover could be increased by 4.39 times, and labor efficiency could also be increased by 18.05%. This fully demonstrates the superiority of implementing the economic accounting system. However, because we have not done enough ideological education work on the implementation of the economic accounting system, and have not deeply exposed and criticized the harmfulness of supply system management thinking, we cannot establish the correct thinking of the economic accounting system, which has led to some deviations and errors. When preparing sales plans, some cadres feared that the "system is strict" and "the plan is the law," so they developed conservative thinking, were hesitant, and adopted a method of "rather small than large" in order to over fulfill the plan. In terms of management style, they only managed goods with high profits and not goods with low profits; believing that retail is more profitable than wholesale, some stores did less wholesale and more retail, neglecting the principle of focusing on wholesale; when ordering goods, they only wanted famous brands and the best-selling goods, ignoring the "surplus goods" in stock; they used their brains and made careful calculations, but mostly considered the interests of others, with less emphasis on their own situation and the overall situation. This series of deviations and errors has formed a major obstacle to the implementation of the economic accounting system. The root cause is inseparable from the supply system management thinking caused by the implementation of the large-scale recall system in the department store system in the past three years. Therefore, we must recognize that supply system management thinking is the great enemy of implementing the economic accounting system, and we must deeply expose the harmfulness of supply system management thinking, thoroughly criticize and eliminate supply system management thinking, and establish the thinking of economic accounting.
        (II)
    Over the past three years, under the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government and the active efforts of all employees, the Southwest District Department Store Company has achieved certain results in adjusting supply and demand, stabilizing prices, and supporting the people's cooperative undertakings. However, due to unclear assets, unclear situations, insufficient foresight, and a failure to make careful calculations, poor management has led to a contradiction between tasks and policies, resulting in the accumulation of a large number of goods and the waste of a huge amount of state funds. If the inventory of goods in the Southwest District Department Store system in 1950 is taken as the base, the inventory of goods in 1951 increased by more than three times, and in 1952 it increased by more than four times, occupying more than twice the amount of funds reasonably needed. The capital turnover rate in 1952 was slower than in 1951. In terms of staffing, we never studied the key to improving work methods to increase labor efficiency, but blindly increased cadres. We also rarely studied the issue of reducing costs within the scope of commodity circulation, but simply ignored everything else in order to complete the "task," resulting in serious losses to state wealth.
    We never conduct investigation and research work, and we do not understand the needs of the people. We formulate sales plans based on "rough" and "approximate" estimates, resulting in detachment from objective reality. A department store sales team in the Neijiang Prefecture of Sichuan Province participated in a primary market materials exchange meeting. The original plan was to sell goods worth 600 million yuan, so goods worth 400 million yuan were transferred out first, but the turnover only reached 60 million yuan, resulting in a large accumulation of materials.
    In terms of processing orders and procurement work, we have not correctly grasped the policy of supporting production. Regardless of the quality of the goods or the size of the demand, we blindly carry out purchases from the perspective of unilaterally taking care of production. In order to take care of local production, we tried our best to require the purchase of local, low-quality small handicraft products or semi-manufactured products; but when selling them, we emphasized the need for fast-selling goods and industrial products from Shanghai. Some factories blindly produce, resulting in the accumulation of products. In order to "rescue" them, the department store companies took over the accumulated products, forming a "commodity moving" situation. The Chongqing Tobacco Factory was poorly managed and its product quality was low. The department store company underwrote its sales, resulting in the accumulation and spoilage of cigarettes. This not only caused serious losses to the department store company, but also fostered the tobacco factory's dependence and failed to promote it to improve product quality, reduce costs, and carry out production reforms according to the needs of the national economy.
    We blindly order goods and blindly allocate and transport them, averaging the distribution of goods, regardless of urban and rural areas and market size, resulting in a phenomenon of accumulation on one side and out-of-stock on the other. The Chongqing Department Store Company was out of stock of wool, while the Changshou Department Store Branch had an accumulation of more than 2,000 pounds of wool. Soviet floral fabrics were in short supply in various places, while the Baimu Town Department Store had a large stock of Soviet floral fabrics. Queen towels, Jinbiao sneakers, and Jinxing fountain pens, which were fast-selling goods with low production volume, were not available in large cities, but rural towns had more stock, with few people buying them. Merchants in large cities went to search for them and sell them at higher prices, resulting in commodity turbulence and a phenomenon in which prices could not be controlled. The Chengdu Department Store Company purchased a batch of writing brushes and chalk brushes produced in Meishan from private merchants, but transferred them to the Meishan Department Store Company. Yongchuan has no electricity during the day, but the Chengdu Department Store Company transferred fluorescent lamps, electric fans, and electric clocks to the Yongchuan Department Store Branch. Due to improper allocation of brown sugar, some areas had enough brown sugar to sell for six or seven months, but in some areas of northern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, and western Sichuan, the department store companies were once out of stock, and even the Fushun Department Store Branch in the sugar-producing area had no sugar supply.
    It is also a very common phenomenon that the department store companies' assets are unclear, they have no idea what they have, and the accounts do not match the goods. The Yunnan Department Store Company had to check the variety and quantity in the warehouse before selling machine-made paper in stock in order to open a bill of lading for delivery. The Chongqing Department Store Company actually left fast-selling cotton毛衫pants, sanitary shirts and pants, processed socks, and water bottles in the warehouse unattended, causing the market to be out of stock for a time; a large number of toothpastes were stored in the warehouse for two years, resulting in deterioration and water loss, with more than 2,000 dozen being completely scrapped. A large number of oil inks, western medicines, and daily necessities in the Leshan Department Store Company's inventory were mostly damaged. The former western Sichuan Department Store Company had 35 kinds of machine-made paper in stock, 18 of which had never met with customers. The People's Publishing House wanted to buy 3,000 reams of 米色newsprint, but the company did not understand the inventory situation and dared not sell it.
    The purely "task" viewpoint dominates us and prevents us from implementing price policies well. In the early stage of carrying out the industrial product sales campaign, because we did not have a deep understanding of the policies and the tasks assigned were not clear and specific enough, we only adopted a general call. Therefore, the former southern Sichuan District Department Store Company, in order to strive to complete the task, did not start from actively thinking about sales, but universally carried out sales on credit to private merchants. Some areas' department store companies "assigned recognition and purchase" to organ cadres. Some areas' department store companies promoted the "one person, one share" campaign. Various places set up too many mobile sales teams, carrying burdens and rushing to the market, failing to correctly implement the principle of focusing on wholesale, which affected the relationship with cooperatives and private merchants. When the higher authorities corrected it, various places universally withdrew the sales teams (even the fixed teams were withdrawn) without steps or plans. Some state-owned stores even stopped retailing major commodities such as edible sugar and cotton cloth. Commodity prices are never researched and analyzed, and price control is often "rather high than low," fearing that setting them too low will require self-criticism and compensation; on the other hand, they unilaterally require higher authorities to sell at lower prices. Some department store companies often delayed the execution of lowering the prices of fast-selling commodities by several days. In 1952, we set the purchase price of edible sugar very high, exceeding a reasonable level, which stimulated production, restricted consumption, and caused serious accumulation and dissolution of edible sugar in department store companies throughout the district, resulting in serious losses.
    For the past three years, the department store companies at all levels in the Southwest District have mainly faced the higher authorities, demanding "more cadres, more commodities, and more funds" to complete the tasks. We also did not conduct investigation and research, so we allocated funds and transferred goods downwards according to their requirements, causing great harm.
        (III)
    Now, although the department store system in the Southwest District has begun to implement the economic accounting system, the management thinking of the supply system has not been thoroughly eliminated, and it is a major obstacle to the implementation of the economic accounting system. Therefore, we must also organize all cadres to seriously criticize the management thinking of the supply system and deeply study the economic accounting system. For the accumulated commodities, we must actively promote sales so that the funds accumulated by the excess commodities after asset verification can quickly become active circulating funds and be rapidly invested in national economic construction. We must also conduct investigation and research to clarify the production and sales of commodities and the people's actual needs for commodities.
    In order to promote the implementation of the economic accounting system in the department store system, the Southwest Trade Bureau and relevant departments have organized several working groups to assist department store wholesale stations and stores in establishing various systems, actively developing businesses, and paving a smooth road for the implementation of the economic accounting system.
    We plan to conduct an inspection after the economic accounting system has been implemented for a period of time. The main focus is to check whether the management thinking of the supply system has been thoroughly eliminated, whether the various systems for implementing economic accounting have been established, whether the established ones are sound and applicable, whether the various quotas (including the asset verification quota) are correct and reasonable, and what major difficulties still exist in the implementation process, so as to summarize experience, correct shortcomings in a timely manner, and implement the economic accounting system.

    供给制经营思想是我们实行经济核算制的大敌
    中国百货公司西南区公司经理    樊陶斋
    （一）
    西南区百货系统对于建立采购供应批发站和实行经济核算制，采取了试点筹备，全面实施的方针。从去年十一月份开始，首先筹建重庆站，拟订制度，取得经验，推行全区。去年十二月中、下旬，西南各省百货公司分别召开了财务会计会议及供应业务会议，检查了工作。发现了各地公司由于经营管理不善，加以长期的大回笼制和供给制经营思想的影响，造成了商品的严重积压，资金的大量浪费。各地公司根据合理需要，初步核定各个批发站及国营百货商店的资金，签定了供应合同，拟订了各种制度，确定了各项定额。西南区公司并决定设立九处采购供应批发站，开设国营百货商店一百四十一处。各批发站和商店都在今年一月一日起正式开业，并开始实行经济核算制。各级批发站和商店不再是向上级要货要人去完成任务，而是大家动脑筋和强调计划性了。四川、西康、贵州、重庆等地批发站及商店初步核资的结果，资金比过去可以节省百分之五十以上，人员可以减少百分之二八·六四，资金周转可以提高四·三九倍，劳动效率也可提高百分之一八·○五。这充分显示出实行经济核算制的优越性。但是由于我们对实行经济核算制的思想教育工作做得不够，没有深入地揭发与批判供给制经营思想的危害性，也就不能树立经济核算制的正确思想，因而产生了一些偏向和错误；在编制销售计划时，若干干部惧怕“制度严”和“计划就是法律”，于是产生保守思想，缩手缩脚，采取宁小勿大，以便超额完成的作法。在经营作风上，利多的就经营，利少的就不经营；认为零售比批发利厚，有的商店便少做批发，多营零售，贯彻以批发为主的方针就不顾了；要货是专要名牌货和最畅销的货，库存的“多余商品”也不管了；开动脑筋，精打细算，是盘算别人的多，从本身着眼和从整体出发的少。这一系列的偏向和错误，形成了对实行经济核算制的重大阻碍。追根究底，这是与百货系统在过去三年中实行大回笼制度所造成的供给制经营思想分不开的。因此，我们必须认清供给制经营思想是实行经济核算制的大敌，必须深入揭发供给制经营思想的危害性，彻底批判和清除供给制经营思想，树立经济核算的思想。
        （二）
    西南区百货公司三年来，在党和人民政府的正确领导、全体职工的积极努力下，对于调剂供求、稳定物价和扶助人民合作事业的工作上有一定成绩，但由于家底不清，情况不明，预见性不足，不进行精打细算，经营管理不善，使任务与政策对立，结果大批商品积压，浪费了国家巨量资金。如以一九五○年西南区百货系统的库存商品为基数，则一九五一年库存商品增加了三倍多，一九五二年增加了四倍多，占用的资金，超过合理需要的一倍以上。一九五二年资金周转率比一九五一年还慢。在人员编制上，我们从不去研究改进工作方法的关键，以提高劳动效率，而是盲目增加干部。我们也很少研究在商品流通范围内减低费用的问题，只是单纯为了完成“任务”，对其它一切都不顾，因而使国家财富受到严重损失。
    我们从来不进行调查研究工作，对人民的需要不了解，订销售计划是凭“大概”“差不多”的估计，结果脱离客观实际。四川内江专区一个百货推销组参加初级市场物资交流会，原订计划要销售价值六亿元的商品，于是先调出了价值四亿元的商品，结果营业额仅达六千万元，造成大量的物资积压。
    在加工订货和采购工作上，我们没有正确掌握扶植生产的政策，不问商品质量如何，也不问需要量大小，只从片面照顾生产的观点出发，就盲目进行收购。为了照顾地方生产，就尽量要求收购当地品质低劣的小手工业品或半机制品；但在销售时又强调要畅销货，要上海的工业品。有的工厂盲目生产，造成产品积压，百货公司为了“救济”，便去把积压的产品接过来，形成“商品搬家”。重庆烟厂经营不善，产品质量低劣，百货公司替它包销，造成纸烟积压、霉坏。这不仅使百货公司损失严重，而且也助长了烟厂的依赖思想，不能促使其提高产品质量、降低成本，按照国民经济的需要进行生产改革。
    我们不分城乡和市场大小，盲目要货，盲目调拨运输，平均分配商品，结果造成一面积压，一面脱销的现象。重庆市百货公司的毛线脱销，而长寿百货支公司则积压二千多磅毛线。各地苏联花布供不应求，而椑木镇百货商店则存有很多苏联花布。皇后毛巾、锦标球鞋、金星钢笔等生产量不大的畅销商品，大城市无货供应，农村城镇的商店却存货较多，少人购买，大城市的商贩便去搜购回来抬价出售，造成商品乱流，价格无法掌握的现象。成都百货公司向私商收购了一批眉山产的毛笔、粉笔刷子，却把它们调到眉山百货公司去。永川白天无电，成都百货公司还把日光灯、电风扇、电钟调到永川百货支公司去。由于红糖调拨不当，有的地区积压的红糖可销六、七个月，但在川北、川东、川西某些地方百货公司曾经一度脱销，甚至产糖区的富顺百货支公司也发生无糖供应的现象。
    百货公司的家底不清，心中无数，账货不符，也是很普遍的现象。云南省百货公司库存机制纸出售要先去仓库查明品种数量，才能开单提货。重庆市百货公司竟把畅销的棉毛衫裤、卫生衫裤、加工袜子、水瓶等放在仓库里不闻不问，而使市场一度脱销；大批牙膏在仓库里存了两年，结果变质走水，完全报废的就有二千多打。乐山百货公司库存的大批油墨、西药和日用品大多损坏。前川西百货公司库存三十五种机制纸，有十八种从未和顾主见面，人民出版社要买三千令米色新闻纸，公司不了解库存情况竟不敢卖。
    单纯“任务”观点支配着我们不能很好执行物价政策。在开展工业品销售运动初期，由于我们对政策体会不深，下达任务不够明确具体，只采取一般号召的办法，于是，前川南区百货公司为了争取完成任务，不从积极想法推销着眼，却普遍地对私商进行赊销。有的地区百货公司对机关干部“摊派认购”。有的地区百货公司推行“一人一份”运动。各地过多的设立流动推销组，挑担赶场，不能正确地贯彻执行以批发为主的方针，因而影响到与合作社、私商的关系。当上级加以纠正后，各地又无步骤、无计划地普遍撤退推销组（连固定组也撤了）。有的国营商店甚至对主要商品如食糖、棉布也不零售了。对商品价格从不研究分析，在物价掌握上往往是“宁高勿低”，怕订低了要作检讨和赔偿；另
    一方面却又片面要求上级降价出售。有的百货公司对调低畅销商品的价格时，往往拖延几天才执行。一九五二年，我们把食糖收购价格订得很高，超过了合理水平，结果刺激了生产，限制了消费，造成全区百货公司食糖积压、溶化，损失很严重。
    三年来，西南区各级百货公司主要是面向上级，要求“干部多，商品多，资金多”好完成任务，而我们也不进行调查研究，便根据他们的要求往下拨款调货，造成很大的恶果。
        （三）
    现在，西南区百货系统虽然已经开始实行经济核算制，但由于供给制的经营思想还没有彻底清除，它是实行经济核算制的重大障碍，因此我们还必须组织全体干部认真批判供给制经营思想，深入钻研经济核算制。对于积压的商品，我们必须积极推销，使核资后多余的商品所积压的资金赶快变成活的流动资金，迅速投向国家经济建设。我们还必须进行调查研究，弄清商品产销情况和人民对商品的实际需要。
    为了推进百货系统实行经济核算制，西南贸易局与有关部门组织了若干个工作组，到各地协助百货批发站和商店建立各种制度，积极开展业务，为推行经济核算制铺开一条顺利的道路。
    我们准备在经济核算制试行一段时期以后进行一次检查，主要是检查供给制经营思想是否已彻底肃清，实行经济核算的各种制度是否已经建立，已建立的是否健全适用，各种定额（包括核资额）是否正确合理，推行当中尚有什么重大困难，以便总结经验，及时改正缺点，贯彻实行经济核算制。
