    An Open Letter to American Christians on Stopping Germ Warfare
    Wu Yaozong, Member of the World Peace Council
    Dear American Christian Fellow Believers:

    I am compelled by my conscience, that is, by my Christian faith, to write you this letter. It is very likely that only a very few of you will be able to see this letter, and when you do see it, some will tell you: "This is propaganda, do not believe it." But precisely because of this, I am even more compelled to write to you, because as a Christian, I have a responsibility to tell you the facts I know about the happiness of people all over the world.

    I think you have already heard the news that the American army is conducting germ warfare in Korea and on Chinese territory. This is a shocking piece of news that has shaken the whole world. Many well-meaning people who have been deceived were stunned when they heard the news and said, "This is impossible; it is unimaginable that a civilized country like the United States would conduct such inhumane germ warfare." However, what these well-meaning people thought was impossible has now become an ironclad fact. The American army, on instructions from Washington, began experimental germ-spreading in Korea and Northeast China in November 1951; by May 1952, germ warfare had become part of the regular combat operations of the US Air Force. This genocidal crime has been absolutely and accurately proven by various international investigative bodies, especially the International Scientific Commission composed of world-renowned scientists from six countries, after on-site investigations. In addition to these groups, many individuals, including such world-renowned Christian figures as Reverend Johnson of England and Dr. Endicott of Canada, have, after careful investigation and research, fully affirmed this monstrous crime of the American army. Pastor Wang Zizhong of the Beijing Congregational Church also personally witnessed evidence of the US conducting germ warfare in the invaded areas of Northeast China. I myself did not participate in the investigation, but I have seen the germ warfare exhibition, which lists many irrefutable facts. Included in the materials in this exhibition are the confessions written in their own hand by two captured American Air Force pilots—Lieutenant Quinn and Lieutenant Enock—and recordings of these confessions. Is this a pile of materials fabricated out of thin air? Were those clear-headed, unimpeachable internationally renowned figures deceived by someone or violated their conscience to bear false witness? I think that an unbiased person, especially a Christian who is willing to pursue the truth, absolutely cannot believe this. Jesus said, "For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known." (Matthew 10:26) The facts about germ warfare are the best proof of this sentence.

    In addition to the above-mentioned pile of irrefutable materials, we have recently seen the confessions of two other prisoners—Colonel Schwenk, Chief of Staff of the First Air Wing of the US Marine Corps, and Major Bley, Ordnance Officer. Their confessions prove that the highest military authority of the US government—the Joint Chiefs of Staff—had formulated a plan for large-scale germ warfare in Korea as early as 1951, and issued instructions from Washington in October of the same year to be executed by General Ridgway, then Commander-in-Chief of the US Far East Command. The publication of these documents has made any sophistry and denial by the American authorities untenable. In Schwenk’s confession, there is a passage that deserves your special attention. He quoted an instruction given to him by his superiors at the time: “It is more important to avoid letting our own people know than to conceal the facts from the enemy,” because since "germ warfare has been carried out, many pilots have become prisoners of war; therefore, the enemy must now know that germ warfare is being used." These few words should be a great enlightenment to you. Your government wants to deceive you, because only when the American people are kept in the dark can they get the American people to support the plan of aggressive war, endure the burden that this plan imposes on them, and allow a small group of billionaires to obtain the greatest profits.

    The American authorities not only flatly deny their crimes, but also continue to spread germs more widely in Korea and Northeast China, and have not shown any signs of stopping.

    Dear American Christian fellow believers, in the face of such a serious fact, can we remain silent? The United States is often called a Christian country; but your government is using germs to massacre peaceful residents. The deadly enemies of mankind are famine and disease; for thousands of years, countless kind and wise people in the world have racked their brains to prevent famine and disease. Every invention and every achievement of theirs has been praised and commemorated by the vast number of people. For this reason, the protocol signed by forty-two countries in Geneva in 1925 clearly stipulated the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons. However, the disasters that mankind has exhausted its efforts to prevent completely, your government is trying to actively, systematically, and inhumanly bring to millions of innocent people in germ warfare. This crime against human nature is absolutely intolerable to the conscience of mankind, and even more intolerable to the conscience of Christians. Schwenk said in his confession: "Every officer was both shocked and ashamed when he first heard that the United States was using germ warfare in Korea."

    For this reason, I want to appeal to you: I want to ask you to publicize to the broad masses of the American people the fact that your government is conducting germ warfare in Korea and China, and to lodge a stern protest against this matter; I want to ask you to demand that your government promptly ratify and strictly implement the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which it has already signed. In order to save mankind from the threat of germ warfare, Christians all over the world have a responsibility to bring the criminals who carry out germ warfare to justice. I hope that my American colleagues will take on this sacred task first.

    May American Christians and Chinese Christians jointly pursue and realize the teachings of Jesus: "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." (John 8:32)

### 为制止细菌战给美国基督徒的一封公开信

    为制止细菌战给美国基督徒的一封公开信
    世界和平理事会理事　吴耀宗亲爱的美国基督教同道们：
    我受了良心的驱使，也就是受了我的基督教信仰的驱使，不得不给你们写这封信。很可能地，你们只有极少数的人能够看到这封信，并且，当你们看到这封信的时候，就会有人告诉你们：“这是宣传，不要相信它。”但是，正因为这样，我更加要给你们写信，因为，作为一个基督徒，我有责任把我所知道的有关全世界人民幸福的事实告诉你们。
    美国军队在朝鲜和中国领土进行细菌战这个消息，我想你们早已听到了。这是一个震动全世界的消息。许多受了蒙蔽的善良的人们听到这个消息就愕然地说：“这是不可能的；像美国这样一个文明的国家进行惨无人道的细菌战，这是不能想像的。”然而，这些善良的人们所认为不可能的事，现在却已成为铁一般的事实了。美国军队，奉了华盛顿的指示，从一九五一年十一月就开始以试验性质在朝鲜和中国东北进行着细菌的撒布；到了一九五二年五月，细菌战就变成美国空军正规作战行动的一部分。这一个灭绝人性的罪行，经过各种国际调查团体，特别是由六个国家的世界闻名的科学家们所组成的国际科学委员会在现场的调查，已经得到绝对精确的证明。除了这些团体之外，还有许多个别的人，包括英国约翰逊教长和加拿大文幼章博士这样世界知名的基督教人士，都在经过仔细的调查研究以后，完全肯定了美国军队这一滔天罪行。北京公理会王梓仲牧师也在我国东北曾受侵袭的地区目睹美国进行细菌战的罪证。我自己没有参加过调查，但却看过了罗列许多无可置辩的事实的细菌战展览会。包括在这个展览会的资料里面的有美国两个空军俘虏——奎恩中尉和伊纳克中尉——亲笔写的供词和这些供词的录音。这一大堆材料是凭空制造出来的么？那些头脑清楚，人格无可訾议的国际知名人士是受了什么人的欺骗或是违背了他们的良心，去作假的见证么？我想，一个没有成见的人，尤其是一个愿意追求真理的基督徒，是绝对不能这样相信的。耶稣说：“掩盖的事，没有不露出来的；隐藏的事，没有不被人知道的。”（马太十章二十五节）关于细菌战的事实，就是这一句话最好的证明。
    在上述那一大堆颠扑不破的材料以外，我们最近又看到其他两个俘虏—美国海军陆战队第一空军联队参谋长上校许威布尔和军械官少校布莱的供词。他们的供词证明美国政府最高军事机关—参谋长联席会议早在一九五一年即已制定了在朝鲜大规模进行细菌战的计划，并于同年十月自华盛顿发出指示，由美国远东司令部当时的总司令李奇微予以执行。这些证件的公布使美国当局任何狡辩与抵赖都无法自圆其说。在许威布尔的供词中，有一段特别值得你们注意。他征引了当时上级所给他的一个指示：“更重要的是避免使我们自己的人知道，而不是对敌人隐蔽事实，”因为自从“进行了细菌战以来，许多驾驶员已成为战俘；因此，到现在敌人一定已经知道使用了细菌战。”这几句话对你们应当是一个极大的启发。你们的政府要欺骗你们，因为只有在美国人民被蒙蔽的情况下，他们才能使美国人民拥护侵略战争的计划，忍受这个计划所加给他们的重担，使一小撮亿万富翁获得最大的利润。
    美国当局不但矢口否认他们的罪行，并且继续在朝鲜和我国东北更加广泛地撒布细菌，至今没有丝毫收敛的迹象。
    亲爱的美国基督教同道们，在这样一个严重的事实面前，我们能够缄默么？美国是经常地被称为基督教的国家；但你们的政府却用细菌来屠杀和平的居民。人类的死敌是灾荒与疾病；几千年来世界无数善良智慧的人民，为了防止灾荒与疾病，曾经绞尽了他们的心血。他们的每一个发明，每一个成就，都被广大的人民歌颂着，纪念着。为了这个原因，一九二五年由四十二个国家在日内瓦签订的议定书曾经明白规定禁止细菌武器的使用。但是，人类用尽了心力还来不及完全防止的灾害，你们的政府却企图在细菌战中主动地、有计划地、灭绝人性地带给千千万万无辜的人民。这一个违反人类本性的罪行是人类的良心所绝对不能容许的，更是基督徒的良心所绝对不能容许的。许威布尔在他的供词中说：“每一个军官在第一次听说美国正在朝鲜使用细菌战时，都是既震惊又羞惭。”
    为此，我要向你们呼吁：我要请你们将你们政府在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的事实向广大的美国人民宣传，并为这件事提出严厉的抗议；我要请你们要求你们的政府将它所已经签字的一九二五年日内瓦议定书迅速批准，并严格执行。为了使人类免于细菌战的威胁，全世界的基督徒都有责任使进行细菌战的罪犯，受到正义的裁判。我希望美国的同道们，能首先担负起这一神圣的任务。
    愿美国的基督徒和中国的基督徒共同追求并实现耶稣的教训：“你们必晓得真理，真理必叫你们得以自由”。（约翰八章三十二节）
