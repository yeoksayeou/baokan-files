Certain state-owned commercial institutions across the country, following the resolutions of the National Commercial Department and Bureau Chiefs Conference, universally carried out the first step of implementing the economic accounting system in the first quarter, changed the treasury system, and prepared to implement the economic accounting system. However, some units did not implement the spirit of the new system, resulting in detours.

According to the report of the work inspection team dispatched by the Central Ministry of Commerce to various places: Some units did not combine the anti-bureaucracy struggle with the implementation of the economic accounting system. They are now carrying out the anti-bureaucracy struggle, intending to postpone the implementation of the economic accounting system to the second quarter. The Central Ministry of Commerce believes that this approach is wrong. The work of opposing bureaucracy should be combined with the work of establishing wholesale stations and verifying funds for state-owned commercial enterprises. After mobilizing the masses to oppose bureaucracy and the supply system's management ideology, exposing shortcomings, carrying out bottom-up criticism, and leading comrades conducting self-criticism, the work of establishing stations and verifying funds should immediately follow. This is a major construction task to overcome bureaucracy. However, some units, such as the Jinan Petroleum Company, did not mobilize the masses to expose bureaucracy, conduct criticism and self-criticism, and combine discussions on construction work before establishing wholesale stations and verifying funds. As a result, the majority of employees did not realize the serious harm of bureaucracy and the supply system's management ideology, nor did they realize the necessity of implementing the economic accounting system. This reduced the effectiveness of establishing stations and verifying funds, forming a "new wine in old bottles" situation.

The inspection report of the work inspection team reflects: Some units are preparing to thoroughly investigate property while establishing wholesale stations and verifying funds. The Central Ministry of Commerce believes that this determination is good. However, except for the Northeast region, it seems that it is not possible to thoroughly investigate the property at one time based on the existing work foundation and current system in various parts of the country within the customs. It must be resolved after the funds have been verified and the wholesale stations have been established, based on the mobilization of the masses. The most important task at present is to establish wholesale stations and verify funds, and this major task must not be hindered by the clearing of property.

According to the reflection of the Shanxi work inspection team: When the Shanxi Provincial Department of Commerce convened a meeting of heads of industry and commerce sections and managers of various companies, they made multiple reports within a few days on the spirit of the National Commercial Planning Conference and the resolutions of the Department of Commerce and Bureau Chiefs Conference convened by the Central Ministry of Commerce, as well as the specific methods for implementing the economic accounting system and other specific issues. The attendees felt confused, could not grasp the key points, and had no way to discuss. The Central Ministry of Commerce believes that this approach is incorrect. First of all, the spirit of various meetings of the Central Ministry of Commerce should be conveyed so that the comrades attending the meeting realize the fundamental shortcomings in the work of state-owned commercial enterprises, understand why it is necessary to implement the economic accounting system and properly arrange the market, and understand why it is necessary to fight against bureaucracy and the supply system's management ideology. With ideological consensus, we can then discuss and resolve specific issues and determine specific measures to be implemented based on local conditions.

    某些国营商业机构
    在建立批发站核定资金工作中走了弯路
    全国各地国营商业机构遵照全国商业厅局长会议的决议，在第一季度普遍进行了实行经济核算制的第一步工作，改变金库制，准备实行经济核算制。但有些单位没有贯彻新制度精神，以致走了弯路。
    据中央商业部派赴各地的工作检查组的报告：有些单位没有把反官僚主义斗争和实行经济核算制结合起来。他们现在进行反官僚主义斗争，打算把实行经济核算制工作推迟到第二季度进行。中央商业部认为这种作法是错误的。应该把反对官僚主义斗争和国营商业建立批发站核定资金的工作结合进行。在发动群众反对官僚主义与供给制经营思想，揭发缺点，进行了由下而上的批评，领导同志进行了自我批评后，紧跟着就应该进行建站核资工作，这是克服官僚主义的一项最主要的建设工作。但有些单位，如济南的石油公司，在建立批发站核定资金以前，没有发动群众揭发官僚主义，进行批评与自我批评，结合讨论建设工作，因此广大职工没有认识到官僚主义与供给制经营思想的严重危害，没有认识实行经济核算制的必要性，这就降低了建站核资的效果，形成“换汤不换药”。
    工作检查组的检查报告反映：有的单位准备一面建立批发站核定资金，一面彻底查清财产。中央商业部认为这种决心是好的。但除东北地区外，关内各地根据现有工作基础与现行制度看来，还不可能一次把财产彻底查清，须待核定了资金，建立了批发站以后，在发动群众的基础之上加以解决。当前最主要的工作是建立批发站、核定资金，决不能因为清理财产而妨碍这个主要的工作。
    据山西工作检查组反映：山西省商业厅召开各地工商科长、各公司经理会议时，把中央商业部召开的全国商业计划会议，商业厅、局长会议决议的精神和实行经济核算制的具体办法以及其他具体问题，在几天之内一连作了多次报告，到会人员感到混乱，抓不住重点，无从讨论。中央商业部认为这种作法是不对的。应该首先传达中央商业部各种会议的精神，使到会同志认识到国营商业工作中的根本缺点，使大家懂得为什么必须实行经济核算制与妥善安排市场的道理，懂得为什么必须与官僚主义、供给制经营思想作斗争的道理，在思想一致的情况下，再去讨论与解决具体问题，根据当地情况，决定实行的具体措施。
