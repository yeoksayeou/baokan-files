    The American ruling class, in order to create an atmosphere of tension and terror, and to facilitate arms expansion, war preparations, and fascist rule, is intensifying its attack on peace-loving people in the United States. The Rosenberg case, which has lasted for more than two years, is a powerful proof of this. This incident is entirely a planned conspiracy by the American ruling class to frame peace-loving people. Therefore, from the beginning to the present, this despicable act of the U.S. government has been strongly protested by the American people and the people of all countries in the world. Recently, Eisenhower's brazen announcement rejecting the Rosenbergs' request to revoke their unreasonable sentence has aroused an even greater wave of protests from people around the world.
    Julius Rosenberg and his wife Ethel were kind American people who lived ordinary lives. The couple were progressive in their thinking and loved to read progressive publications. In 1940, Rosenberg worked as an engineer in the U.S. Army Signal Corps in New York; in 1945, he was fired from the army for his progressive ideas. After losing his job, Rosenberg and Ethel's brother, Greenglass, started a small engineering firm together. In 1950, this small engineering firm went bankrupt. Due to business relations, Greenglass and Rosenberg had some disagreements, and Greenglass left.
    Shortly thereafter, the so-called "atomic spy" case deliberately manufactured by the U.S. ruling class was officially staged as planned. First, they instructed a so-called "scientist" named Fuchs to admit that he was a spy, fabricating that he had leaked secrets about the atomic bomb to the Soviet Union when he worked at the atomic bomb factory in New Mexico in 1944-1945. Fuchs also named Greenglass and others as accomplices. Subsequently, the U.S. government pretended to "sentence" Fuchs to fourteen years in "prison," allowing him to continue researching atomic bombs, while arresting Greenglass and his wife, whom he had implicated. After Greenglass was arrested, he was threatened with severe punishment, so he sought help from his defense lawyer, Roach, a traitor to the peace movement. After Roach's arrangements, Greenglass and his wife, the Attorney General, and some agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation held several small gatherings. In this way, a conspiracy to frame someone was concocted. Greenglass's wife was released without trial; Greenglass came forward to testify, falsely accusing Rosenberg of being the mastermind of the "atomic spy network" and Ethel of being her "husband's assistant and moral supporter."
    From June 1950, when the Rosenbergs were arrested, the U.S. government's propaganda machine loudly proclaimed that the Rosenbergs' guilt had been established, and that 118 witnesses, including some senior and authoritative nuclear physicists, would testify during the trial. Eight months passed, and in March 1951, the New York Federal Court began the trial of this so-called "atomic spy case." During the trial, only twenty of the previously mentioned 118 witnesses appeared, none of whom were scientists. Among the twenty witnesses who appeared, only three mentioned Rosenberg, two of whom were Greenglass and his wife, and the other was a man named Max Elitcher, who had been sentenced to prison for forging documents. He admitted that he could resolve "everything he hoped for" by being a witness this time. Throughout the trial, Greenglass's verbal testimony was the only evidence. Greenglass had only received a high school education and failed all eight technical courses when he studied at a technical college. He admitted that he knew nothing about the formulas of the components of the atomic bomb. However, when testifying in court, he said that he had drawn a detailed diagram of the atomic bomb and handed it to Rosenberg along with twelve pages of written material. This fabricated testimony, even "Time Magazine" admitted, "is of no scientific significance." However, apart from this, the American court could not produce any other credible evidence.
    In fact, as the "National Committee for a Fair Trial for the Rosenberg Case" said, the U.S. ruling class replaced "evidence with politics." These "evidences" are: there was a bag for raising donations for Spanish refugees in the Rosenberg's home, Ethel had participated in the signing of 50,000 New York citizens supporting Peter Cacchione, the New York City councilor candidate of the American Communist Party, the Rosenbergs were active members of their union, and occasionally read the Worker's Daily, and the Rosenbergs believed that the Soviet Union was the main force in the war against Nazi Germany and were happy and praised the opening of the second battlefield by the United States and Britain. This is the attitude that a righteous and honest American should have, but the U.S. ruling class decided to execute the Rosenbergs for this reason. Judge Kaufman of the New York Federal Court, who directly tried the Rosenberg case, said: This is "a crime of thought and belief," and said: The severity of this "crime" is "worse than murder." May I ask, how can opposing war and advocating peace in thought and belief be "worse than murder" and must be executed? No matter how the American ruling class fabricates facts and makes nonsense, this despicable and shameless method can never deceive anyone who can distinguish right from wrong. The reason why the American ruling class does this is to threaten the peace-loving people of the United States and suppress the American people's struggle for peace. Therefore, this is not only a frame-up of the Rosenbergs, but also an oppression of all peace-loving people in the United States.
    This despicable conspiracy of the American ruling class did not achieve its expected purpose. They imprisoned the Rosenbergs for more than two years and sentenced them to death. However, the Rosenbergs adhered to truth and justice and showed heroic and unyielding spirit. Since April 5, 1951, when the New York Federal Court sentenced the Rosenbergs to death, the Rosenbergs have appealed to the New York American Circuit Court, the U.S. Supreme Court, and even the U.S. President, requesting a retrial and revocation of the illegal verdict. The Rosenbergs have always insisted that they are innocent. They once publicly declared: "We don't want to die, we are still young, and we still need a long and useful life." However, they are even more unwilling to succumb, they said: "If we replace death with a life bought by giving up human self-esteem and giving up the moral struggle for democracy and ideals, then we have not seen our future at all, and there is nothing to leave to our children and those who inherit us." The American judicial authorities have repeatedly rejected the Rosenbergs' appeals. In January of this year, the Rosenbergs wrote directly to U.S. President Truman, asking him to revoke the unreasonable verdict. The letter said: "We have been told again and again that our defense of our innocence is arrogant, not to maintain our integrity, but to gain a mysterious 'martyrdom' glory. This argument has made us tired of it. We are not martyrs, nor are we heroes, and we don't want to be martyrs and heroes. We don't want to die, we are innocent. The price of exchanging even a priceless life for abandoning the truth is too high. A life redeemed in this way cannot survive in dignity and self-esteem." The Rosenbergs fought so strongly against the conspirators, exposing the ugly face of the American ruling class. Now Truman's successor, Eisenhower, brazenly refused to revoke the original judgment and is determined to kill the Rosenbergs. Rosenberg's mother once persuaded the Rosenbergs to fabricate confessions and admit guilt in order to obtain release. This persuasion was rejected. The Rosenbergs announced again that they could not abandon justice because of the terror of death. They "are unwilling to pay the price extorted by people to sell their faith in a peaceful world and their faith in friendship and democracy."
    The American people and the people of all countries in the world have constantly raised strong protests against the U.S. government's unreasonable verdict against the Rosenbergs. After Eisenhower refused to revoke the original verdict, the American people and the people of all countries in the world launched an even greater protest movement. In the United States, representatives of the people of New York and representatives of the people of other places rushed to Washington, organized day and night petitions in front of the White House, and resolutely demanded that the U.S. government revoke the illegal verdict. In West Germany, Britain, France, Belgium and other places, people also held rallies everywhere to express their protests; in many places, the masses organized marches to demonstrate in front of the American consulates. The American Federal Court originally decided to execute the Rosenbergs in mid-March, but due to the protest movement of the American and people of various countries, the American New York Federal Court was forced to postpone the execution date to March 30. Now, the protest movement of the American and people of various countries is still continuing vigorously to stop the U.S. government's crime of murdering the Rosenbergs. (Fu Zhen)

    美国政府陷害罗森堡夫妇事件的经过
    美国统治集团为了制造紧张和恐怖空气，为了便利扩军备战和法西斯统治，正加紧向美国爱好和平的人民进攻。延续了两年多的罗森堡夫妇事件，就是一个有力的证明。这一事件，完全是美国统治集团有计划制造的对和平人民的阴谋陷害。因此，从开始到现在，美国政府的这一卑劣行为一直受到美国人民、世界各国人民的强烈抗议。最近，由于艾森豪威尔悍然宣布拒绝罗森堡夫妇要求撤销对他们的无理判决的请求，激起了世界各国人民更加高涨的抗议浪潮。
    朱利叶斯·罗森堡和他的妻子伊斯尔，是一对善良的美国人，他们一直过着普通人民的生活。夫妻两人，思想进步，爱读进步刊物。一九四零年，罗森堡曾在纽约美国信号部队做过工程师；一九四五年，由于思想进步，他被部队开除了。失业后，罗森堡曾和伊斯尔的弟弟格林格拉斯合伙开设了一个小型的工程行。一九五零年，这个小工程行倒闭了。由于营业上的关系，格林格拉斯和罗森堡闹了些意见，格林格拉斯便走了。
    此后不久，美国统治集团所故意制造的所谓“原子间谍”案就按预定计划正式上演。首先，指使一个名叫福赫斯的所谓“科学家”承认他自己是间谍，无中生有地说当他于一九四四——一九四五年在美国新墨西哥州原子弹工厂工作时，曾把有关原子弹的秘密泄露给苏联，福赫斯并且供出同谋犯格林格拉斯等人。此后，美国政府装腔做势地把福赫斯“判”了十四年“徒刑”，让他继续去研究原子弹，而将他所供出的格林格拉斯及其妻子逮捕。格林格拉斯被捕后，在严重的刑罚面前受到威胁，于是，向他的辩护律师，和平运动的叛徒罗奇求援。经过罗奇的布置，格林格拉斯夫妇和总检察官以及联邦调查局的一些特务，举行过几次小型的集会。这样，一个阴谋陷害的事件就制造出来了。格林格拉斯的妻子没有受审，释放了；格林格拉斯出面作证，诬指罗森堡是“原子间谍网”主使人，伊斯尔是她“丈夫的助手和道义上的支持者”。
    从一九五零年六月罗森堡夫妇被捕以后，美国政府的宣传机器就大事鼓吹说罗森堡夫妇的罪名已经确立，审讯时将有一百一十八名证人作证，其中并包括一些高级权威的原子核物理学家等等。时间过了八个月，到一九五一年的三月，纽约联邦法院开始审讯这个所谓“原子间谍案”。审讯时，事先所说的一百一十八名证人只有二十人出席，里面没有一个是科学家。在出席的二十个证人中间，只有三个人提到罗森堡，其中两个就是格林格拉斯夫妇，另一个是因伪造文件被判处徒刑的名叫麦克司·爱力却的家伙，他承认他做了这次证人就可解决“他所希望的一切”。在整个审讯中，格林格拉斯的口头证明是唯一证据。格林格拉斯过去仅受过高中教育，在一个工艺学院学习时，八项技术课程全部不及格，他自认对于原子弹构成部分的公式一窍不通。但是在法庭做证时，他却说他曾画了一幅原子弹的精细图样，连同十二页书面材料一起交给罗森堡。这种无中生有的伪证，甚至连“时代杂志”都承认“是毫无科学意义的”。可是，除过这个以外，美国法院提不出任何别的令人置信的证据。
    事实上，正如“争取罗森堡案公正裁决全国委员会”所说的，美国统治集团是以“政治代替了证据”。这些“证据”是：罗森堡家中有一个为西班牙流亡难民募捐的袋子，伊斯尔曾参加过纽约五万市民支持美国共产党纽约市参议员候选人彼得·卡麦钦的签名，罗森堡夫妇在他们的工会里都是积极的会员，并偶尔阅读工人日报，还有，罗森堡夫妇认为苏联是反纳粹德国战争中的主力，曾对美英开辟第二战场感到高兴并加以赞扬。这是一个正义的、诚实的美国人所应有的态度，可是，美国统治集团就因此决定将罗森堡夫妇处死。直接审理罗森堡夫妇案件的纽约联邦法院的法官考夫曼说：这是“一个思想与信仰上的罪行”，又说：这个“罪行”的严重程度“甚于谋杀”。试问，在思想和信仰上反对战争、主张和平，怎么就会“甚于谋杀”而必须予以处死呢？无论美国统治集团怎样捏造事实，胡拉混扯，这种卑劣无耻的手段决不能欺骗任何明辨是非的人。美国统治集团所以这样做，目的是威胁美国爱好和平人民，镇压美国人民争取和平的斗争。所以，这不仅是对罗森堡夫妇的陷害，而且也是对整个美国爱好和平人民的压迫。
    美国统治集团这一卑劣的阴谋，并没有达到它预期的目的。他们将罗森堡夫妇囚禁了两年多，并且判处了死刑。但是，罗森堡夫妇坚持真理和正义，表现了英勇不屈的气概。从一九五一年四月五日纽约联邦法院将罗森堡夫妇判处死刑以来，罗森堡夫妇曾先后向纽约美国巡回法庭、美国最高法院以至美国总统提出上诉，要求重新审理和撤销非法判决。罗森堡夫妇始终坚持他们是无罪的。他们曾经公开宣称：“我们不愿意死，我们还年青，我们还需要长而且有益的生命。”可是，他们更不愿意屈服，他们说：“如果拿放弃人类的自尊，放弃为民主、为理想的道德的斗争所买到的生命来代替死亡，那是我们一点也没有看到我们的将来，没有任何东西可以留给我们的孩子与继承我们的人们。”美国的司法当局曾经几次驳回了罗森堡夫妇的上诉。今年一月，罗森堡夫妇直接致书美国总统杜鲁门，要求他撤销无理的判决。信中说：“我们一次又一次地被告诉说，我们为自己无罪的辩护是骄横的，不是为了要保持我们的正直，而是要想获得一种莫名其妙的‘殉道’的光荣。这种论调已使我们感到厌烦了。我们不是殉道者，也不是英雄，我们也不想当殉道者和英雄。我们不要死，我们是无罪的。以舍弃真理来换取即使是无价之宝的生命，所付的代价是太高了。这样赎来的生命，是不能在尊严和自尊中生存的。”罗森堡夫妇就是这样坚强地向阴谋陷害者进行斗争，揭露了美国统治集团的丑恶面目。现在杜鲁门的继任者艾森豪威尔悍然拒绝撤销原判，决心将罗森堡夫妇加以杀害。罗森堡夫人的母亲，曾劝说罗森堡夫妇捏造供词，承认有罪以取得释放。这个劝说被拒绝了。罗森堡夫妇再次宣布不能因死的恐怖而放弃正义。他们“不愿意付出人们所勒索的代价，来出卖对一个和平世界的信心，对友好和民主的信心”。
    美国人民和世界各国人民，曾不断对美国政府对罗森堡夫妇的无理判决提出强烈的抗议。艾森豪威尔拒绝撤销原判之后，美国人民和世界各国人民掀起了更加高涨的抗议运动。在美国，纽约人民的代表和其他各地人民的代表纷纷赶往华盛顿，在白宫前组织昼夜不息的请愿，坚决要求美国政府撤销非法的判决。在西德、英国、法国、比利时等地人民也到处举行集会，表示抗议；不少地方的群众并组织游行队伍到美国领事馆门前示威。本来美国联邦法院决定在三月中对罗森堡夫妇执行死刑，但由于美国及各国人民的抗议运动，迫使美国纽约联邦法院将行刑日期推迟到三月三十日，现在，美国及世界各国人民的抗议运动仍在继续蓬勃开展，以制止美国政府谋杀罗森堡夫妇的罪行。（傅真）
