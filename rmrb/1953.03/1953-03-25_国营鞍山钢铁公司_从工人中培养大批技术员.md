    State-Owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company
    Cultivates a Large Number of Technicians from Among Workers
    Over the past few years, the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company has cultivated more than 400 technicians from among its workers. These technicians, who come from worker backgrounds, possess a high sense of responsibility and are able to closely unite with the workers. The main method employed by Anshan Iron and Steel Company to cultivate workers into technicians is the widespread promotion of signing apprenticeship contracts. This is based on the successful experience of veteran technical worker Li Feng'en being trained by engineer Zhou Chuandian to become an outstanding blast furnace shift technician. Li Feng'en has been selected as a special-class labor model for the entire city and attended the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna.
    In order to further strengthen its technical force, particularly to increase new blood in the ranks of technical personnel, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has formulated a plan for cultivating workers into technicians in the future and has already opened more than a dozen specialized training classes. Currently, there are more than 300 workers in production departments alone being trained. Recently, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also made a decision on cultivating technicians from among workers, instructing Party organizations in various factories, mines, and capital construction departments to supervise and assist the administrative departments in doing this work well.

    国营鞍山钢铁公司
    从工人中培养大批技术员
    国营鞍山钢铁公司，几年来已从工人中培养出技术员四百多人。这些工人出身的技术员，对工作有高度的责任心，能够紧密地团结工人。鞍山钢铁公司培养工人成为技术员的主要办法，是普遍地推广签订师徒合同。这是老技术工人李凤恩被工程师周传典培养成为优秀的炼铁炉值班技术员的成功经验。李凤恩已被选为全市的特等劳动模范，并出席了在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会。
    为进一步壮大技术力量，特别是增加技术人员队伍中新的血液，鞍山钢铁公司已订出今后培养工人成为技术员的计划，并已开办了十几所专门训练班。现在正在培养中的工人，只生产部门就有三百多人。最近，中共鞍山市委员会又作出了关于从工人中培养技术员的决定，指示各工厂、矿山和基本建设部门的党组织，要监督和协助行政部门做好这一工作。　（新华社）
