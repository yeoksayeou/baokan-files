Two New Working Methods of Handan Department Store Wholesale Station

Since the Handan Department Store Wholesale Station finalized its capital in November last year, its management has begun to improve. The wholesale station has implemented advanced working methods such as convening special commodity salesperson representative meetings and establishing quota indicator boards, taking a step forward on the track of economic accounting.

After the Handan Department Store Wholesale Station and Wholesale Retail Department finalized their capital, the remnants of the supply system and bureaucratic style in operation remained serious. Research on people's needs, production and sales, and inventory of goods was very poor. In terms of business, the wholesale station did not actively organize sources of goods, and the sales units did not understand the types, specifications, quality, and quantity of inventory goods, so the business could not meet the needs of the market. In December last year, the Handan area was muddy after the snow, and the people urgently needed rubber shoes, but the wholesale station did not actively purchase them. Private merchants transported a large number of rubber shoes, each pair of rubber shoes was nearly 10,000 yuan higher than the listed price, which increased the burden on consumers. In the socks wholesale market, in December last year, the sales volume of state-owned commerce accounted for only 28%, and it could not play an active leading role in the market. At that time, the sales units and the wholesale station believed that this was due to the incomplete variety of socks operated by state-owned commerce and the excessive price difference between urban and rural areas.

In response to this situation, the Handan Department Store Wholesale Station held a forum for socks operators, in which relevant personnel from various retail departments and warehouses participated. At the meeting, various sock samples from the wholesale station's inventory, the wholesale retail department, the retail stores, and the private merchants were displayed, compared, and studied. The results showed that there were 85 kinds of socks in the inventory, while the wholesale station had only 55 kinds, and the retail department had only 36 kinds; 32 kinds of socks sold by private merchants were not available in state-owned commerce, but among the existing stock of state-owned commerce, 24 kinds could be replaced in terms of specifications, quality, color, and price, and only 8 kinds could not be replaced, and these 8 kinds of socks accounted for only about 7% of the total sales volume. The meeting also studied the expenses and operating methods of public and private commercial sock operations. Facts have proved that the problem is not that state-owned commerce does not sell a complete variety of socks, nor is it that the price difference between urban and rural areas of socks is too large, but that the salespersons have not seen the goods in the warehouse. Many kinds of socks are sleeping in the warehouse on the one hand, and are out of stock in the store on the other hand. The main reason for this phenomenon is that the business personnel of the wholesale station have not strictly specialized in their work. They do not understand the market situation, are not familiar with inventory goods, and rarely send people to the sales units for in-depth understanding. The wholesale station should not only do a good job in supply according to the plan, but also connect relevant business units above and below, communicate production and sales, and promote all units to actively promote sales.

After the Handan Department Store Wholesale Station finalized its capital, although the internal links have established a contact responsibility system, the implementation is far from enough: the responsibilities of each link are unclear, and various procedures are not closely linked, which cannot meet the requirements of accelerating commodity circulation and reducing expenses, and cannot fully play the role of economic accounting. For example, in terms of financial accounting, in 1952, the goods exceeded the books by 3.6 billion yuan. Although this serious situation of inconsistency between accounts and goods has attracted attention, it has not been actively and quickly dealt with; some cadres have realized that the cash inventory should not be too large, but they do not pay enough attention to accelerating the turnover of commodity funds.

In order to make all employees clear about the contents of various systems and their responsibilities, clarify the specific methods of contact, and ensure regular mutual supervision and inspection, the Handan Department Store Wholesale Station has established a variety of quota indicator board systems. This kind of indicator board marks the number of quotas for the implementation of economic accounting and the main person in charge of the quota execution, and points out the quota execution situation at any time, so that relevant personnel and all employees can often understand the situation, actively cooperate, and supervise each other. For example, the cash inventory quota indicator board can urge the business department to purchase goods in time; the commodity inventory quota indicator board can urge the business department to purchase and sell goods in time; the accounts receivable quota indicator board can urge the business department to deliver goods in time. Each link formulates indicator boards for various important quotas related to all aspects based on this principle. The formulation of this kind of quota indicator board is discussed by the masses. It can often reflect the real situation, supervise the units and personnel who cannot complete the quota in time, and urge and help the units and individuals who cannot complete the quota to improve their work.

Regularly holding special commodity salesperson representative meetings and establishing quota indicator boards are good working methods for state-owned commerce to move forward on the new track of economic accounting. Through special commodity salesperson representative meetings to study people's needs, communicate production and sales, understand inventory goods, clarify the proportion of public and private operations, and study price policies, this is conducive to the improvement of sales methods; through quota indicator boards to clarify the status and role of each link and related personnel in the implementation of economic accounting, clarify their respective responsibilities and methods of mutual connection, and give play to the role of mutual supervision and inspection, this can promote the completion and overfulfillment of various quotas. These two working methods can be implemented in state-owned commercial units that have already finalized their capital according to specific circumstances.

To use the above methods, it is necessary to mobilize the masses and rely on the masses, and it is necessary to continuously fight against bureaucracy and the remnants of the supply system in operation, so that the implementation of economic accounting can have a good effect.

    邯郸百货批发站的两个新的工作方法
    邯郸百货批发站自去年十一月核定资金以后，经营管理开始有了改进。该批发站实行了召开专门商品营业员代表会议，建立定额指示牌等先进工作方法，在经济核算制轨道上前进了一步。
    邯郸百货批发站及批发门市部刚刚核定资金以后，经营中的供给制残余和官僚主义作风依然严重。对人民需要、产销情况、库存商品的研究很差。在业务方面，批发站不积极主动地组织货源，销售单位不了解库存商品的品种、规格、质量、数量，因此业务不能适应市场的需要。去年十二月份，邯郸区雪后泥泞，广大人民迫切需要胶鞋，但批发站不积极进货，私商运来大批胶鞋，每双胶鞋高于牌价近一万元，使消费者增加了负担。在袜子的批发市场上，去年十二月份，国营商业销售数量仅占百分之二十八，不能在市场上积极起领导作用。当时，各销货单位和批发站认为这是国营商业经营袜子品种不全以及城城差价过大的缘故。
    针对这种情况，邯郸百货批发站曾举行了一次袜子经营人员座谈会，各零售部及仓库有关人员都参加了。会上把批发站库存的、批发门市部的、零售商店的以及私商出售的各种袜子样品陈列出来，对照加以研究，结果发现库存袜子有八十五种，而批发站只有五十五种，零售部只有三十六种；私商出售的袜子，有三十二种为国营商业所没有，但国营商业现有存货中，有二十四种在规格、质量、色泽、价格方面可以代替，不能代替的只有八种，而这八种袜子在整个销售数量上，只占百分之七左右。会上对公私营商业经营袜子的费用、经营方法也进行了研究。事实证明：问题不在于国营商业经售袜子的品种不全，也不是袜子的城城差价过大，而是由于售货员没有与仓库商品见面，很多种袜子一方面在仓库睡觉，一方面在门市部却脱销。造成这种现象的主要原因是批发站的业务人员还没有严格按专业分工，既不了解市场情况，又不熟悉库存商品，也很少派人到销货单位进行深入了解。批发站不仅应按计划作好供应工作，更要连接上下有关业务单位，沟通产销情况，推动各单位积极推销。
    邯郸百货批发站核定资金后，内部各个环节虽已建立了联系责任制，但贯彻得很不够：各个环节的责任不明，各种手续也没有紧密地联系起来，这就不能适应加速商品流转、降低费用的要求，不能充分发挥经济核算制的作用。譬如在财务会计方面，一九五二年货比帐多三十六亿元，这种帐货不符的严重情况虽已引起注意，但并未积极迅速处理；有些干部虽已认识到现金库存不能过大，但对加速商品资金周转则重视不够。
    为使全体职工明确各项制度内容和自己的职责，明确联系的具体方法，保证经常相互监督、检查，邯郸百货批发站建立了各种定额指示牌制度。这种指示牌标明实行经济核算制的若干定额及执行定额的主要负责人，并随时指出定额执行情况，使有关人员和全体职工经常了解情况、主动配合、相互督促。譬如：现金库存定额指示牌，可以督促业务部门及时进货；商品库存定额指示牌，可以督促业务部门及时购销；往来款项定额指示牌，可以督促业务部门及时发货。各个环节都根据这个道理制定各有关方面各项重要定额的指示牌。这种定额指示牌的制定是经过群众讨论的。它能够经常反映真实情况，对不能完成定额的单位与人员及时加以督促，并督促、帮助不能完成定额的单位与个人，改进工作。
    定期举行专门商品营业员代表会和建立定额指示牌，是国营商业在经济核算制新轨道上前进的良好的工作方法。通过专门商品营业员代表会研究人民需要、沟通产销情况、了解库存商品、弄清公私经营比重、研究价格政策，这就有利于推销方法的改进；通过定额指示牌明确各个环节与有关人员在实行经济核算制中的地位与作用、明确各自的职责与相互联系的方法，发挥相互监督、检查的作用，这就能推动各项定额的完成和超额完成。这两个工作方法，在已经核定资金的国营商业单位内，是可以按照具体情况实行的。
    运用以上的方法，必须发动群众和依靠群众，必须向官僚主义和经营中的供给制残余作不断的斗争，这对贯彻实行经济核算制才能有良好的作用。
