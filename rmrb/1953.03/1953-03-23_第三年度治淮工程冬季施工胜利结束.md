Xinhua News Agency Report: The third year of the Huai River Project's winter construction has victoriously concluded, completing over 37 million cubic meters of earthwork, 170,000 cubic meters of concrete work, and 350,000 cubic meters of stonework. The Chenzuwan flood diversion project in the upper reaches of the Huai River and the drainage canals north of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal in the lower reaches have been completed successively according to schedule. Currently, apart from the large-scale Nanwan Reservoir, Boshan Reservoir, Fozi Ridge Reservoir, and Sanhe Sluice Gate projects which are continuing, all other projects have been halted. Seventy percent of the 1.2 million civilian laborers scattered along the long Huai River construction line have returned to their hometowns for production.

During the third year of the Huai River Project's winter construction, the vast numbers of civilian laborers and cadres at the construction sites extensively and enthusiastically launched a production increase and economy campaign. Many new work methods and innovations emerged at various construction sites. The "series-connected electrical blasting box" created by technical cadres at the Nanwan Reservoir increased the blasting efficiency for excavating the reservoir's water conveyance tunnel by more than 90 percent. In the Chong River and Tong River dredging projects, the "diagonal cutting of thin silt method" created by civilian laborer Yang Zhenxi's team overcame the difficulty of extracting soil from 3-meter-deep thin silt, increasing work efficiency from an average of 0.51 cubic meters per person per day to over 0.7 cubic meters. In addition, the "steel material heat treatment indicator" created by Fozi Ridge Reservoir technicians Gu Yonglin, Shi Guifa, and others also proved very effective.

Due to the unusually early arrival of the cold wave last winter and heavy rain and snow, coupled with the tight deadlines, the construction of the Huai River Project faced exceptional difficulties. However, the workers and civilian laborers overcame various obstacles with selfless labor enthusiasm. To complete the first phase of riverbed clearing at the Nanwan Reservoir before the spring flood season, workers and civilian laborers continued working tirelessly in the snow and rain. When excavating the Longgou canal, a thousand young civilian laborers volunteered to join the shock brigade, bravely submitting "volunteer letters" to the construction site command and continuing to excavate the canal on snowy nights. As a result, although the Nanwan Reservoir construction site had fifteen fewer clear working days before the spring flood season than actually needed, the canal excavation work was completed five days ahead of schedule. A large number of model laborers emerged at various construction sites and received awards from the project command.

    第三年度治淮工程冬季施工胜利结束
    【新华社讯】第三年度治淮工程冬季施工结束，共完成土方工程三千七百多万公方，混凝土工程十七万公方，石方工程三十五万公方。淮河上游的陈族湾分洪工程和下游的苏北灌溉总渠以北的排水渠等工程，都按预定计划先后完工。目前除了规模宏大的南湾水库、薄山水库、佛子岭水库、三河闸等工程继续施工外，其他各项工程都已停工。散布在漫长治淮线上的一百二十万民工，有百分之七十已回乡生产。
    第三年度治淮工程冬季施工中，工地上的广大民工和干部曾广泛而热烈地展开增产节约运动。各工地出现了许多新的工作法和新创造。南湾水库技术干部制造的“电流串连爆破箱”，使开凿水库输水洞的爆破效率提高了百分之九十以上。漴河和潼河疏浚工程中，民工杨振喜分队创造的“斜角挖稀淤法”，克服了在三公尺深的稀淤泥中取土的困难，使工作效率从每人每日平均做零点五一公方，提高到零点七公方以上。此外，佛子岭水库技工顾永林、史桂发等创造的“钢料热处理指示器”，也有很大效用。
    由于去年冬季寒流来得特别早，雨雪很多，任务又紧，因而治淮工程施工异常困难。但是，工人、民工们以忘我的劳动热情，克服了各种困难。南湾水库第一期河槽清基工程，为了争取在春汛前完成，工人、民工们奋不顾身地在雪里雨里继续做工。开挖龙沟时，工地上便有一千个青年民工报名参加了突击队，他们英勇地向工地指挥部呈送“志愿书”，在雪夜里继续开挖河槽。因此，虽然南湾水库工地春汛前晴朗的工作日较工程实际需要的工作日少了十五天，但开挖河槽工作却提前五天完成。各工地都涌现大批劳动模范，受到工程指挥部的奖励。
