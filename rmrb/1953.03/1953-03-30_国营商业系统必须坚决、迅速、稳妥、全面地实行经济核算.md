    State-Owned Commercial System Must Resolutely, Rapidly, Steadily, and Comprehensively Implement Economic Accounting
    Zeng Chuanliu, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central South Region
    The state-owned commercial system must resolutely, rapidly, steadily, and comprehensively implement economic accounting. It is wrong not to implement it resolutely; although resolute, being slow is also not right; implementing it very resolutely and rapidly, but making a mess of it, is also not allowed; not only that, but it must also be implemented comprehensively in the commercial system to achieve the expected results.
    First, the implementation of economic accounting must be resolute. To achieve victory in everything, there must be two basic conditions: one is objective possibility, and the other is the determination to realize this possibility.
    Today, the objective conditions for implementing economic accounting are already in place. This is because our country's financial situation has fundamentally improved, and prices have completely stabilized. This is very important for economic accounting. Without complete price stability, it is impossible to implement economic accounting. This is the reason why we are not implementing economic accounting earlier but are implementing it today. Over the past three years, state-owned trading organizations have developed greatly, and a group of trade cadres have been trained, some necessary systems have been established, and some experience has been gained. These are all necessary conditions for implementing economic accounting. However, without the will and determination to implement economic accounting, possibility cannot be turned into reality.
    We have long implemented a supply system-like management method in our trade work, and many cadres have developed a supply system mentality. Its specific manifestations are only caring about tasks, not calculating detailed accounts, and being indifferent to the accumulation and damage of goods. This kind of thinking is quite common and serious in the trade system, and it has caused significant harm to the country. Therefore, in order to smoothly implement economic accounting in the trade system, we must first resolutely and thoroughly expose and criticize the supply system mentality and bureaucratic work style; otherwise, the remnants of the supply system will still not be eliminated, and economic accounting will not be implemented.
    Second, it must not only be implemented resolutely, but also rapidly. Our country's large-scale economic construction has begun, and the state's requirements for state-owned trade systems to accumulate funds have been placed on the important agenda. However, at present, the state-owned trade system's unreasonable accumulation of goods, slow capital turnover, high circulation costs, and the occupation and waste of state funds are very serious. The income of state-owned enterprises already accounts for 29.97 percent of the state's fiscal budget income in 1953, ranking second. If state-owned enterprises cannot complete the task of accumulation, it will inevitably affect the country's economic construction. Therefore, implementing economic accounting in the trade system is imperative.
    Comrade Stalin, in his article "New Situation and New Tasks of Economic Construction," pointed out when discussing the economic accounting system: "This is the question of the source of funds for supplying industry and supplying the national economy," "It is necessary to find new sources and strengthen the old sources," "Implement and consolidate the economic accounting system in all our enterprises and systematically reduce costs." Comrade Stalin's instruction has special significance in the early stage of our country's economic construction, and our trade workers should gladly accept this glorious task.
    Third, in order to implement the economic accounting system quickly and without chaos, arrangements must be made properly in all aspects. First, the market must be arranged well. We cannot close the door and clear assets, verify funds, and adjust institutions, as this will inevitably affect the market. Therefore, when adjusting institutions, the new institutions must ensure no chaos, and the old institutions must be thoroughly cleared up. Second, in verifying funds, attention should be paid to preventing two deviations: one is to verify the funds too large, resulting in accumulation, wasting state funds, and hindering the country's economic construction. The other is to verify the funds too small, regardless of the specific situation, resulting in out-of-stock phenomena. This situation has already appeared in the department store system and must be corrected quickly. Verifying funds is a very detailed task, which should be based on the actual situation and should look forward, consider the exploration of potential forces, and accelerate the turnover of funds. Third, it must be coordinated with the cooperative plan and grasp a certain proportion of public and private sectors. Funds are stipulated according to the needs of commodity circulation. When making commodity circulation plans, it is necessary to consider both production and sales and the needs of the people, and also to consider the proportion of public and private sectors, and arrange all aspects properly. Fourth, state-owned commerce has the task of supporting production and supplying the needs of the people. At present, it cannot completely avoid unplanned purchases. When encountering this situation, it is necessary to weigh the pros and cons and solve it reasonably. If this kind of commodity has no sales at all, and state-owned commerce takes it all, occupying funds and unable to sell it, it will affect the country's economic construction. If this kind of commodity has sales, but the state-owned trade department does not actively open up sales channels, it is also wrong. We must often tell these situations to the local Party and government leading departments so that they can fully consider this issue; and we should actively mobilize private merchants and let them operate; if sales channels cannot be opened up, we should advise farmers to reduce production appropriately. Fifth, the production and consumption of many commodities are seasonal. Industrial products are produced throughout the year and sold seasonally; agricultural products are produced seasonally and sold throughout the year. Therefore, preparing seasonal commodities cannot be regarded as accumulation, this is seasonal storage, and this issue should be considered when verifying funds. Sixth, surplus commodities and unsalable commodities must be properly resolved in accounting. It is necessary to hold internal exchange meetings for mutual adjustment. The Henan Department Store Company held such an exchange meeting in January of this year, adjusting 84 kinds of commodities with a total value of more than 18 billion. If subordinate companies cannot sell the goods and cannot adjust them themselves, the superior company should consider recalling them; otherwise, long-term accumulation is not a solution. Seventh, after the implementation of economic accounting, a part of the personnel will inevitably be surplus. This group of personnel should be handled with a serious and responsible attitude. They cannot be pushed out the door to complete the matter, and they cannot be made unemployed. They can be solved in a variety of ways. Eighth, in the process of implementing economic accounting, we must earnestly complete purchasing and sales plans and other plans, especially commodity circulation plans. It is now the off-season. If the purchasing task cannot be completed, it will affect farmers' production and aggravate the spring famine, and even cause urban workers to lose their jobs, the market to stagnate, and tax revenue not to be completed. Conversely, if the sales plan cannot be completed, it may cause a lack of purchasing funds and an imbalance in market supply and demand. Therefore, we should quickly revitalize the market now. Primary markets should seize the opportunity to hold small-scale exchange meetings to open up sales channels for local products and solve the problem of farmers' production funds in order to get through the off-season. We must ensure the completion of purchasing and sales plans and strive to sell more. Only by selling more can we purchase more, revitalize the market, and complete our own remittance task.
    The above eight points are all things that must be paid attention to in this major transformation. We must ensure that it is fast and not chaotic, that the new and old are distinguished, that all parties are connected, that asset verification does not affect sales, and that changes do not affect the market; we must also ensure that superiors and subordinates are satisfied and that cadres are happy. This is a very arduous task and must be done with all our strength.
        Fourth, according to the decision of the National Commercial Department and Bureau Chiefs Conference, in the first quarter, the department store system is conducting a review, and other companies must set up their stalls. In the second quarter, the department store system enters the business competition, and other systems conduct a review. In this way, when the peak season arrives in the third quarter, we can work normally, which is convenient for purchasing and sales. We must comprehensively implement the economic accounting system and cannot delay it under any pretext. Of course, in the accounting process, there may be differences due to different conditions. Companies with a good foundation can account for more detail, and those with poor conditions can account for less detail, and then from rough to fine. But regardless of whether the conditions are good or bad, they must be implemented without exception. Some units that do not have accounting conditions, such as business groups and offices, must also implement semi-accounting, calculate costs and expenses, and merge with the accounting of directly subordinate units. In short, this work must be done thoroughly and comprehensively. After such a major change, each unit and each comrade must clarify their responsibilities, establish a goal for struggle, and complete work tasks happily and rhythmically.

    国营商业系统必须坚决、迅速、稳妥、全面地实行经济核算
    中南区财政经济委员会副主任  曾传六
    国营商业系统必须坚决地、迅速地、稳妥地、全面地实行经济核算。不坚决实行是错误的；虽然坚决但是缓慢也是不对的；实行得很坚决很迅速，但搞乱了也是不允许的；不仅如此，还必须在商业系统全面实行，才能获得预期的效果。
    第一、实行经济核算必须坚决。一切事情要想取得胜利，必须有两个基本条件，一个是客观的可能性，一个是实现这个可能性的决心。
    我们今天实行经济核算的客观条件已经具备了，这就是我们国家的财经状况已根本好转，物价已完全稳定。这对经济核算很重要，没有一个物价完全的稳定，实行经济核算是不可能的，这就是为什么我们不早点实行经济核算而要在今天实行的道理。三年来，国营贸易机构有很大的发展，并且培养了一批贸易干部，建立了一些必要的制度，取得了一些经验，这都是实行经济核算的必要条件。但是，如果没有实行经济核算的志愿和决心，还不能把可能变为现实。
    我们在贸易工作方面长期实行着类似供给制的经营方法，许多干部就产生了供给制思想。其具体表现为只顾任务，不算细账，对于商品积压损坏漠不关心。这种思想在贸易系统是相当普遍和严重的，它给国家造成了重大的危害。所以，为了在贸易系统顺利地实行经济核算工作，首先必须坚决地、彻底地、揭露和批判供给制思想和官僚主义作风，否则，供给制的残余仍然不能肃清，经济核算将不能贯彻。
    第二、不仅要坚决实行，还要迅速实行。我们国家的大规模经济建设已开始了，国家对于国营贸易系统积累资金的要求提到重要日程上来了。但目前国营贸易系统不合理地积压商品、资金周转慢、流转费用高，占用和浪费国家资金的情形是很严重的。国营企业的收入，在一九五三年国家财政预算收入中已占百分之二十九点九七，居第二位，国营企业如果不能完成积累任务，势必影响国家经济建设。因此在贸易系统实行经济核算，事不宜迟。
    斯大林同志在“新的环境和新的经济建设任务”一文中谈到经济核算制时指出：“这就是供给工业，供给国民经济的资金积累来源问题”，“便要找到新的来源，加强旧的来源”，“在我们所有一切企业内施行并巩固经济核算制，有系统地减低成本费”。斯大林同志这一指示，在我们的国家经济建设初期是有其特殊意义的，我们贸易工作者应该愉快地来接受这一光荣任务。
    第三、为了快而不乱地实行经济核算制，必须在各方面安排妥当。首先是要把市场安排好。我们不能关起门来清理资产、核定资金和调整机构，这样必然影响市场。因此，在调整机构的时候，新的机构要保证不乱，旧的机构要彻底加以清理。其次，在核定资金上要注意防止两个偏向：一个是把资金核的很大，结果造成积压，浪费国家资金，妨碍国家经济建设。另一种是不顾具体情况，资金核的很小，结果造成脱销现象。这一情况目前在百货系统已经出现，必须迅速纠正。核定资金是一件很细致的工作，要根据实际情况，并应向前看，考虑潜在力量的发掘，加速资金的周转。第三，必须与合作社计划衔接和掌握一定的公私比例。资金是根据商品流转的需要规定的，在做商品流转计划时，既要考虑到产销情况和人民需要，又要考虑到公私比重，把各方面安排妥当。第四，国营商业负有扶持生产，供应人民需要的任务，在目前还不能完全避免计划以外的收购。遇到这种情况，就要权衡轻重，合理地加以解决。假使这种商品根本没有销路，国营商业都包下来，占用了资金而卖不掉，就要影响国家经济建设。假使这种商品有销路而国营贸易部门不积极打开销路，也是错误的。我们要把这些情况经常告诉当地党政领导部门，使他们能够充分地考虑这一问题；并应积极发动私商，让他们经营；如果销路确实不能打开，则应劝告农民适当减产。第五，目前许多商品的生产和消费都带有季节性。工业品是全年生产，季节销售；农产品是季节生产，全年销售。因此，准备季节性的商品，不能算做积压，这是季节储备，在核定资金时要考虑这一问题。第六，多余的商品和不合销的商品，在核算中必须予以妥善解决。召开内部交流会以互相调剂是必要的。河南省百货公司今年元月间曾举行了这样的交流会，调剂商品八十四种，总值一百八十多亿。下级公司确实卖不掉而又不能自行调剂的商品，上级公司应该考虑调回，不然长期积压，不是办法。第七，实行经济核算后，必然多出一部分人员，要以严肃负责的态度来处理这批人员，不能推出门完事，不能使其失业，可用多种方法解决。第八，实行经济核算的过程中，必须切实完成购销计划和其他计划，尤其是商品流转计划。现已进入淡季，如果收购任务不能完成，将会影响农民生产和加重春荒，甚至引起城市工人失业、市场死滞、税收不能完成等恶果。反过来说，如果销售计划完不成，可能造成缺乏收购资金，市场供求失调等现象。因此，现在应该赶快把市场搞活。初级市场应抓紧时机召开小型交流会，替土产打开销路，解决农民生产资金的问题，以便度过淡季。要保证完成购销计划，并应争取多销。只有多销才能多购，把市场搞活，并完成本身的上缴任务。
    上边说的八点，都是在这大转变中必须注意的。我们一定要做到快而不乱，新旧分清，各方衔接，核资不影响卖货，变动不影响市场；还要做到上下满意，干部愉快。这是一个很艰巨的工作，必须用全力来作。
        第四、根据全国商业厅局长会议的决定，第一季度，百货系统在进行复查，其他公司要将摊子摆好。第二季度，百货系统进入业务竞赛，其他各系统进行复查。这样到第三季度旺季到来时，我们即可正常地进行工作，便于收购和推销。我们必须全面实行经济核算制，不能以任何藉口拖延下去。当然在核算过程中，可以因条件不同有所分别。公司基础好的可以核细一些，条件差的可以核粗一点，然后由粗到细。但无论条件好的坏的，都要无例外地实行起来。有的单位即使不具备核算条件，如营业组办事处等，也须实行半核算，计算成本费用，合并于直属上级单位核算。总之，这次工作必须彻底全面地作，经过这样的大变革，使每个单位和每个同志，都要明确自己的职责，树立奋斗的目标，愉快而有节奏地完成工作任务。
