Xinhua News Agency, March 29th:

    The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly has begun discussing the issue of U.S. germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China. The U.S. representative and the representatives of other countries who follow it are frantically and shamelessly denying the U.S.'s crime of conducting germ warfare. They are trying their best to shirk their responsibility with lies and slanders, reflecting their great fear of the movement against U.S. germ warfare by people of all countries, because this movement is now flourishing worldwide.
    Since Korea and China accused the U.S. government of its monstrous crime of conducting germ warfare to the people of the world in late February last year, world organizations such as the World Peace Council, the World Federation of Trade Unions, the International Democratic Women's Federation, The World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the International Student Union have issued statements firmly protesting this atrocity by the United States.
    This unprecedented and inhuman barbarity of the U.S. government has aroused great anger among the people of peace-loving and democratic countries. In the bastion of world peace—the Soviet Union—the working people of Moscow first held a grand rally in March last year to protest against U.S. imperialism's use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China. Subsequently, in March and April, mass protest rallies were held in factories, institutions, and schools in cities and towns across the Soviet Union, in mines and collective farms in various regions, and in the Kamchatka Peninsula fishing area and the Taimyr National District within the Arctic Circle. At these rallies, the Soviet working people resolutely demanded an end to germ warfare and the severe punishment of germ warfare criminals.
    In the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Mongolian People's Republic, the Eastern European People's Democracies, and the German Democratic Republic, many mass protest rallies were also held last year. These rallies passed hundreds and thousands of resolutions condemning germ warfare and demanding severe punishment for germ warfare criminals. The Romanian National Assembly also passed a resolution protesting against the use of bacteriological weapons by U.S. imperialists. In these people's democratic countries, the tide of anger against germ warfare continues to rise this year. After captured U.S. military officer, Schwable, and others confessed new evidence about the U.S.'s use of bacteriological weapons, the capital of the German Democratic Republic, Berlin, held a protest rally against U.S. germ warfare on February 25th this year, with several thousand people participating. Romania held a "Day of Protest Against U.S. Imperialism's Use of Bacteriological Weapons" on March 23rd. Around this day, mass protest rallies were held in many cities, villages, factories, schools, and minority areas throughout the country. The people of Czechoslovakia have also put forward guarantees to continue supporting the Korean people this year as a powerful response to the U.S.'s germ warfare.
    The people of Asian countries angrily demand an end to the U.S.'s use of bacteriological weapons against the Korean and Chinese people. They see that the U.S. is conducting cruel experiments in Korea in order to further target the vast population of Asia as the object of U.S. germ warfare when expanding its aggression. In Japan, the first country to be bombed with atomic bombs, organizations such as the Executive Committee of the Japan Peace Committee, the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions, and the Japan National Relief Association issued statements last year protesting against the U.S.'s germ warfare, and more than 4,500 people in the cultural circles signed a petition demanding the prohibition of bacteriological weapons. In India, mass rallies protesting germ warfare were held in various parts of the country last year, with a total participation of hundreds of thousands of people. Many social celebrities, political leaders, members of parliament, famous scientists, doctors, and writers jointly issued statements denouncing the U.S.'s germ warfare. In Pakistan, in Karachi alone, about 200 social celebrities, professors, and others signed the anti-germ warfare declaration initiated by the Peace Committee. In Iran, 40,000 workers and students in Tehran held a mass rally in March last year to protest against the use of bacteriological weapons by U.S. aggressors in Korea and China. This will of the people of Asian countries against U.S. germ warfare was concentratedly reflected in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing last October. The 367 representatives from 37 countries, holding various religious beliefs and political views, unanimously passed a resolution condemning the U.S.'s germ warfare and demanding its immediate cessation. Since the conference, the struggle of the people in the Asian and Pacific regions against germ warfare has been further developed.
    The people of Western European countries are also actively opposing the U.S. germ warfare criminals' insane plan to repeat the terrifying scene of the "Black Death" that prevailed in Europe five hundred years ago. After the Korean and Chinese sides exposed the U.S.'s crime of conducting germ warfare in February last year, a movement against U.S. germ warfare was universally launched throughout Italy. Mass protest rallies or demonstrations were held in cities and villages, workers went on strike to protest, and even some merchants closed their shops and went on strike. In France, the Netherlands, and other countries, the masses of people also held many protest rallies and demonstrations. When the chief culprit of germ warfare, "Plague General" Ridgway, was transferred to the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Army and inspected various Western European countries in May last year, the hatred of the people of Western Europe concentratedly erupted. People in countries such as France and Italy held countless large-scale protest demonstrations. The scale of this political demonstration has not been seen in Western European countries for a long time. Since then, the movement against germ warfare has become more in-depth. In September last year, the British Trades Union Congress, disregarding the obstruction of right-wing union leaders, passed the proposal of the Association of Scientific Workers requesting the prohibition of germ warfare with a majority of 269,000 votes. In March this year, British Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry, Dr. Synge, also condemned the U.S. aggressors for conducting germ warfare at the British "Science for Peace Committee."
    In the United States, people are constantly voicing their justice and conscience. The New York Branch of the American Federation of Scientific Workers wrote to the U.S. President in May last year requesting the prohibition of the manufacture and use of bacteriological weapons. Forty-one social celebrities, including International Longshore and Warehouse Union President Bridges, National Marine Cooks and Stewards Union President Bryson, historian Du Bois, writer Fast, singer Robeson, and former Virgin Islands Governor Lovett, jointly wrote to the U.S. President in May last year, requesting the U.S. government to ratify the Geneva Protocol prohibiting germ warfare.
    The movement against germ warfare has also been launched in Latin American countries. Many members of parliament, Supreme Court judges, famous doctors, and writers in Brazil have condemned the U.S. germ warfare atrocities. The capital of Argentina held a street rally of thousands of people last year to protest against germ warfare. The American Peace Congress held last year also passed a special resolution condemning the U.S.'s use of bacteriological weapons in Korea.
    The facts of germ warfare have exposed the barbarity and baseness of U.S. warmongers, allowing many people who originally believed in the so-called "American civilization" to see the truth of this "civilization." For example, Ms. Appel, a famous Danish Liberal, had voted against some resolutions at the Second World Peace Congress in 1950 because she thought MacArthur's charges were untenable at the time, but after the United States launched germ warfare last year, she expressed great indignation and suggested that newspapers publish documents proving the crimes of this small group of Americans. The market for the U.S.'s lies of denying guilt is getting smaller and smaller, and more and more people are learning about the ironclad evidence. For example, Indian renowned bacteriologist and member of parliament Major-General S. S. Sokhey and Danish renowned zoologist Dr. Sigurd Andersen recently determined after studying the materials in detail that the United States had indeed used bacteriological weapons.
    The world-scale movement against germ warfare is developing increasingly. The World People's Peace Congress held in December last year, with the participation of 157 natural scientists and 84 legal experts, finally passed a resolution demanding the immediate prohibition of germ warfare in Korea and China.
    This situation has caused great panic among the U.S. ruling clique. Therefore, the U.S. representative is trying to spread blatant lies at the United Nations General Assembly to deny the crime of germ warfare. U.S. newspapers point out that this is an attempt to "eliminate" the so-called "propaganda impact" against germ warfare. However, the U.S. is doing this in vain. Any lies and tricks of the U.S. germ warfare criminals cannot stop the tide of anger against germ warfare in various countries. While the U.S. is verbally denying at the United Nations General Assembly, it is stepping up the shameful act of spreading bacteria in Korea in the spring, which will only make the people of all countries more determined to take action to stop the criminal bloody hands of U.S. germ warfare criminals.

    反对美国细菌战怒潮高涨
    全世界人民要求制止美国细菌战犯的血手
    【新华社二十九日讯】联合国大会政治委员会已开始讨论美国在朝鲜及中国东北进行细菌战问题，美国代表以及追随它的其他国家代表正在会上手忙脚乱地无耻抵赖美国进行细菌战的罪行。他们竭力想用谎言及诽谤来推脱罪责，反映出他们对各国人民反对美国进行细菌战的运动十分害怕，因为这个运动目前已经在全世界范围内蓬勃开展了。
    自从朝鲜和中国方面在去年二月下旬向全世界人民控诉美国政府进行细菌战的滔天罪行以后，世界和平理事会、世界工会联合会、国际民主妇女联合会、世界民主青年联盟、国际学生联合会等世界性的民主组织都发表声明，坚决抗议美国这一暴行。
    美国政府这一史无前例的灭绝人性的野蛮行为，激起了和平民主国家人民的极大愤怒。在世界和平的堡垒——苏联，莫斯科劳动人民首先在去年三月举行了盛大集会，抗议美帝国主义在朝鲜及中国使用细菌武器。接着，在三、四月里，在全苏联各大小城市的工厂、机关及学校中，在各地矿山和集体农场中，以及在堪察加半岛渔民区及北极圈内的台麦尔民族区中，纷纷举行群众抗议大会，苏联劳动人民在这些大会上，坚决要求制止细菌战并严惩细菌战犯。
    在越南民主共和国、蒙古人民共和国、东欧人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国中，在去年也举行了很多次群众抗议大会，这些大会通过成百成千件决议，谴责细菌战，并要求严惩细菌战犯。罗马尼亚国民议会并通过了抗议美帝国主义者使用细菌武器的决议。在这些人民民主国家中，抗议细菌战的怒潮在今年继续高涨。在被俘美国军官许威布尔等供出关于美国使用细菌武器的新的证据以后，德意志民主共和国首都柏林在今年二月二十五日举行了反对美国细菌战的抗议大会，有好几千人参加。罗马尼亚在三月二十三日举行了“抗议美帝国主义使用细菌武器日”，在这一天前后，全国许多城市、乡村、工厂、学校和少数民族地区都举行了群众性的抗议集会。捷克斯洛伐克人民在今年也纷纷提出继续支援朝鲜人民的保证，作为对美国进行细菌战的有力回答。
    亚洲各国人民愤怒地要求制止美国对朝中人民使用细菌武器，他们看到，美国在朝鲜进行残酷试验，就是为了准备在扩大侵略时进一步把亚洲广大人民作为美国细菌战的对象。在第一个遭到原子弹轰炸的国家——日本，日本拥护和平委员会执行委员会、全日本产业别工会会议、日本国民救援会等组织在去年都发表声明抗议美国进行细菌战，文化界四千五百多人签名要求禁止细菌武器。在印度，全国各地在去年举行了大大小小的抗议细菌战的群众集会，参加者共达数十万人。很多社会名流、政治领袖、国会议员、著名科学家、医生和作家联合发表声明，斥责美国进行细菌战。在巴基斯坦，仅在喀喇蚩一地和平委员会所发起的反对细菌战宣言上，就有社会名流、教授等约两百人签名。在伊朗，德黑兰工人和学生四万人在去年三月举行了抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜及中国使用细菌武器的群众大会。亚洲各国人民这种反对美国细菌战的意志，集中反映在去年十月在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上，出席会议的持有各种不同宗教信仰及政治见解的三十七国三百六十七位代表一致通过决议，谴责美国进行细菌战，要求立即加以制止。在会议以后，亚洲及太平洋区域人民反对细菌战的斗争又有了进一步的开展。
    西欧各国人民也积极反对美国细菌战犯企图使五百年前“黑死病”在欧洲流行的可怖景象重演的疯狂计划。在去年二月朝中方面揭发美国进行细菌战的罪行后，意大利全国各地普遍展开了反对美国进行细菌战的运动，在城市及乡村纷纷举行群众抗议大会或示威游行，工人们罢工抗议，甚至有些商人也关店罢市。在法国、荷兰等其他国家中，人民群众也举行了许多抗议大会和示威游行。当细菌战罪魁“瘟疫将军”李奇微去年五月调任北大西洋军总司令并到西欧各国巡视时，西欧人民的憎恨情绪集中地爆发出来了。法国、意大利等国人民举行了无数声势浩大的抗议示威，这种政治示威的规模是西欧各国很久以来所不多见的。在此以后，反对细菌战的运动更加深入了。去年九月英国职工大会不顾右翼工会头子的阻挠，以二十六万九千票的多数通过了科学工作者协会要求禁止细菌战的提案。今年三月，英国诺贝尔化学奖金得奖人辛治博士也在英国“争取和平科学委员会”上谴责美国侵略者进行细菌战。
    在美国，人民不断发出正义和良心的呼声。美国科学工作者协会纽约分会在去年五月致函美国总统要求禁止制造和使用细菌武器。国际码头与仓库工人工会主席布里治、全国海船厨师侍者工会主席布莱逊、历史学家杜波依斯、作家法斯特、歌唱家罗伯逊、前维尔京群岛总督罗维特等四十一位社会名流在去年五月联名写信给美国总统，要求美国政府批准禁止细菌战的日内瓦议定书。
    抗议细菌战的运动也在拉丁美洲各国展开。巴西许多国会议员、最高法院法官、著名医生、作家都谴责美国细菌战暴行。阿根廷首都去年举行了几千人的街头集会，抗议细菌战。去年举行的美洲和平大会也通过了一项特别决议，谴责美国在朝鲜使用细菌武器。
    细菌战的事实揭露了美国战争贩子的野蛮和卑鄙，使许多原来迷信所谓“美国文明”的人们看到了这种“文明”的真相。例如，丹麦著名自由党人阿佩尔女士，她在一九五○年第二届世界保卫和平大会上曾对有些决议投了反对票，因为当时她认为麦克阿瑟的罪名是不能成立的，但是到去年美国发动细菌战后，她表示非常愤慨，建议报纸公布证明美国这一小撮人的罪行的文件。美国抵赖罪责的谎言的市场是愈来愈小了，铁案如山的罪证为愈来愈多的人所获悉。如印度著名细菌学家、国会议员索克少将及丹麦著名动物学家西古达·安德生博士等人最近在详细研究了材料以后，都断定美国确已使用了细菌武器。
    世界规模的反对细菌战运动日益开展起来了。去年十二月举行的世界人民和平大会，在一百五十七位自然科学家和八十四位法律专家的参加之下，最后通过了要求立即禁止在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的决议。
    这种情况使美国统治集团感到十分惊慌。美国代表因此竭力在联合国大会上散布漫天大谎，来抵赖细菌战罪行。美国报纸指出，这样做是企图“消除”所谓反对细菌战的“宣传影响”。但是，美国这样做是枉费心机的。美国细菌战犯的任何谎言和诡计都无法阻挡世界各国抗议细菌战的怒潮。美国一面在联合国大会上空口否认，一面却利用春季在朝鲜加紧撒布细菌的可耻行径，只会使各国人民更加坚决地行动起来，制止美国细菌战犯的罪恶血手。
