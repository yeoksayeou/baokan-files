Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 23rd: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded its discussion on the report of the Disarmament Commission and the proposals concerning this report on March 21st.

    Indian representative Menon pointed out that the work of the United Nations Disarmament Commission was unsatisfactory. He said: As long as the legal representatives of the People's Republic of China are not allowed to participate in the General Assembly and all United Nations bodies, the discussions on disarmament issues in the United Nations will not achieve significant results. Allowing them to participate in the work related to disarmament and in the formulation of all measures for world peace is extremely important and will help eliminate international tensions. The Indian representative said that his delegation would support all proposals aimed at disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.
    Soviet representative Zorin emphasized that, in discussing the report of the Disarmament Commission, most speakers had already acknowledged that the Commission had not fulfilled its main task.
    Zorin said that if the United Nations truly wants to ensure the maintenance of peace and eliminate the threat of another war, it must take all measures to end the arms race and genuinely and effectively reduce armaments and prohibit atomic weapons. Zorin recalled that the Soviet delegation had repeatedly stated:
    (1) The Soviet government advocates that after the adoption of decisions on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, all countries should immediately submit all information on the state of their armaments and armed forces, including information on atomic weapons and military bases on foreign territories.
    (2) The Soviet Union advocates the implementation of strict international control and continuous inspection. Marshal Stalin's statement on international control, which was quoted by the head of the Byelorussian delegation, clearly demonstrates the Soviet Union's position on this issue, which needs no further explanation.
    (3) The first statement made by the Soviet delegation on the report of the Disarmament Commission has fully and exhaustively explained the powers of international inspection. There is no need to provide a detailed explanation again at this time.
    While explaining the Soviet proposal submitted to the Political Committee for consideration on March 19, Zorin emphasized that the Soviet proposal is very clear and its purpose is to complete the main task within the scope of disarmament.
    Zorin said that the Soviet delegation considers it necessary to once again request the Political Committee to support this proposal and to declare that the Soviet delegation cannot agree with the proposal put forward by the United States and other countries, because that proposal actually approves the fruitless work of the Disarmament Commission and reiterates the resolutions of the previous General Assembly, which the Soviet delegation could not and cannot agree with.
    After the US representative Gross and several other representatives explained their motivations for voting, the proposal on the report of the Disarmament Commission was put to a vote.
    The Soviet proposal was voted on paragraph by paragraph. Fourteen delegations (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Czechoslovakia, Poland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, Egypt) voted in favor of the following paragraph of the Soviet proposal: The General Assembly "decides to instruct the Disarmament Commission to immediately consider practical measures for disarmament, primarily considering the disarmament of major powers—the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and China—study solutions to the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and establish strict international control to supervise the implementation of these decisions." Six delegations (Burma, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Mexico, and Abyssinia) abstained. Forty countries, including the United States, Britain, and France, voted against the Soviet proposal.
    The Soviet proposal was rejected. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Byelorussia, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, and Poland voted in favor of the entire Soviet proposal, and the delegations of thirteen countries abstained.
    The Political Committee passed, by a majority vote, the proposal put forward by the United States and the representatives of thirteen other countries, which suggested that the Disarmament Commission should continue its work based on the principles put forward in the suggestions of the United States, Britain, and France. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against that proposal. The delegations of India, Burma, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Argentina abstained.

    联大政委会结束关于“联合国裁减军备委员会”报告的讨论
    佐林重申苏联关于裁军合理主张
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：联合国大会政治委员会二十一日会议，已把裁减军备委员会的报告和关于这个报告的提案，讨论完毕。
    印度代表梅农指出联合国裁减军备委员会的工作效果不能令人满意。他说：只要不准许中华人民共和国的合法代表参加大会和一切联合国机构，在联合国里进行的裁减军备问题的讨论便得不到重大的效果。让他们参加有关裁减军备的工作和参加制订世界和平的一切措施是极端重要的，并将有助于消除国际紧张局势。这位印度代表说：他的代表团将支持一切旨在裁减军备和禁止原子武器、细菌武器以及其他大规模杀人武器的建议。
    苏联代表佐林强调说：在讨论裁减军备委员会的报告时，大多数发言人已经承认委员会并没有完成它的主要任务。
    佐林说：假如联合国真正要保证维持和平与消除另一次战争的威胁，它就必须采取一切措施来结束扩张军备运动，并真正有效地裁减军备和禁止原子武器。佐林追述说：苏联代表团曾一再声明：
    （一）苏联政府主张在通过裁减军备与禁止原子武器的决定后，各国应立即提出关于军备和武装部队情况的一切情报，包括原子武器和在外国领土上的军事基地的情报在内。
    （二）苏联主张实行严格的国际管制和经常的视察。斯大林大元帅所发表的、并曾由白俄罗斯代表团团长加以引证的关于国际管制的声明，清楚地表明了苏联在这个问题上所采取的立场，这不需要作任何解释。
    （三）苏联代表团就裁减军备委员会的报告所发表的第一个声明，已经充分详尽地解释了国际视察的权力。目前没有重作详细解释的必要。
    佐林在解释三月十九日提交政治委员会考虑的苏联提案时强调说：苏联的提案非常明白，它的目的是要完成裁减军备范围内的主要任务。
    佐林说：苏联代表团认为有必要再度要求政治委员会支持这个提案，认为有必要声明：苏联代表团不能同意以美国为首的其他国家所提出的那个提案，因为那个提案竟然批准裁减军备委员会所作的毫无成果的工作，并且重申了苏联代表团过去不能同意、现在也不能同意的上次大会的决议。
    在美国代表葛罗斯和其他几个代表解释他们投票的动机以后，关于裁减军备委员会的报告的提案就交付表决。
    苏联的提案是逐段进行表决的。十四个代表团（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、印度、印度尼西亚、伊朗、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯、阿富汗、也门、伊拉克、埃及）投票赞成苏联提案中的下列一段：大会“决定责成裁减军备委员会立即审议裁减军备，首先是考虑裁减大国——美、苏、英、法、中的军备的实际措施，研究解决无条件禁止原子武器、细菌武器和其他大规模杀人武器，并建立严格的国际管制以监督这些决定的执行”。六个代表团（缅甸、玻利维亚、智利、阿根廷、墨西哥和阿比西尼亚）弃权。四十个国家、包括美国、英国和法国——的代表投票反对苏联提案。
    苏联提案被否决了。苏联、白俄罗斯、乌克兰、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰的代表团投票赞成苏联的整个提案，十三个国家的代表团弃权。
    政治委员会以多数票通过了美国和其他十三个国家的代表所提出的提案，这个提案建议裁减军备委员会根据美国、英国和法国的建议中所提出的原则继续它的工作。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的代表团投票反对那个提案。印度、缅甸、沙特阿拉伯、印度尼西亚和阿根廷的代表团弃权。
