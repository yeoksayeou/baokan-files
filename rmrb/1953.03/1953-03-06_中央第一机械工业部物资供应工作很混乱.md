The Central First Ministry of Machine Building has serious disconnections in the allocation of major materials needed for both capital construction and production in the first quarter of this year. This disconnection manifests in two aspects: First, disconnection between higher and lower levels. According to the regulations of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, the major materials needed by factories in the East China, Central South, and Southwest regions under the ministry in the first quarter should be uniformly allocated by the financial and economic committees of the major administrative regions. However, the financial and economic committees of the major administrative regions believed that these factories were already under the direct leadership of the Central First Ministry of Machine Building, and the major materials they needed should also be uniformly allocated by the ministry. When it was finally determined that the factories should still apply for material allocation to the financial and economic committees of the regions where they were located, the material allocation work in some regions had already ended, and some were about to end. Therefore, factories in the East China region under the ministry received no materials uniformly allocated by the state in January, and factories in the Southwest and Central South regions received only 20% to 30% of the actual needs. Second, disconnection between needs and supply. The supply of pig iron to factories in the North China and Northeast regions under the ministry met only 61.5% of the needs, steel ingots 37.6%, structural steel 73.4%, and shaft steel, forged steel, spring steel, ball bearing steel, and various castings were also not fully resolved. The supply of other items such as machine tools, electric motors, and timber was also insufficient. Because the supply of materials and equipment was disconnected from the needs, the progress of capital construction was delayed. Factories under the East China Mechanical Industry Administration even experienced shutdowns due to lack of materials in January.

The main reason for the above phenomena is that the First Ministry of Machine Building has not clearly defined which factories it manages for a long period of time, making it impossible for the ministry's supply bureau to consider material supply work. In addition, individual major administrative regions did not timely and comprehensively organize the application and allocation of material supplies, so that many factories were missed when allocating materials.

Secondly, the planning was not thorough. The ministry's production plan and capital construction plan could not be finalized for a long time and were repeatedly revised. Because the plan was revised too many times, the materials originally applied for allocation may be insufficient, or may be too much, or may be unusable due to inconsistent specifications. For example, after the foreign order procedures had been completed, the Third Bureau of Machine Building under the ministry proposed to add cemented carbide tool bits, and the Fourth Bureau of Machine Building proposed to add I-beams, channel steel, boiler steel plates, etc.; conversely, Factory 201 had already ordered lathes, planers, and electric motors, but applied for returns due to plan revisions.

Thirdly, bureaucratic work styles have made the ministry's material allocation work even more chaotic, creating a situation where materials are stockpiled on the one hand and lacking on the other. From 1950 to the present, the ministry still has a batch of electrical products worth 50 billion yuan that have been stockpiled due to not being allocated in a timely manner. For example, with regard to the materials cleared from the warehouses of various factories, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council has repeatedly instructed the ministry to receive and dispose of them, but the ministry's sales bureau has not seriously implemented this instruction, so that 20,000 tons of mechanical and electrical products are still being shelved. When the ministry prepared for the advance ordering of goods in the first quarter of this year, the sales bureau sent a section chief to the Northeast to investigate the material needs of various factories. After arriving in the Northeast, the section chief only stayed in the administration bureau playing poker and did not go deep into the factories and mines to investigate and understand the situation. As a result, he only brought back some estimated figures from the administration bureau. Therefore, when allocating materials, the ministry was unable to grasp the true situation in the Northeast region, so that the solemn material allocation meeting was actually conducted in a hawking manner.

In order to overcome the chaos and disconnection in material supply work, the Central First Ministry of Machine Building has instructed the various specialized administrative bureaus and regional sub-bureaus to attach importance to material supply work. For materials in short supply, the bureaus must first make adjustments within their respective scopes, make full use of the existing materials of enterprises, and try to use substitutes. At the same time, the ministry has instructed the production enterprises and management agencies under its jurisdiction to conduct the following inventory work: 1. Inventory the actual order volume and shortfall of the pre-allocated materials in the first quarter of this year; 2. Inventory the types and quantities of materials ordered from abroad this year; 3. Inventory all stocked major materials and surplus materials.

### 中央第一机械工业部物资供应工作很混乱

    中央第一机械工业部物资供应工作很混乱
    中央第一机械工业部今年第一季度基本建设方面和生产方面所需要的主要物资，在分配工作上有严重的脱节现象。这种脱节现象表现在两方面：一、上下脱节。按照政务院财政经济委员会规定，该部所属华东、中南、西南地区各厂第一季度所需要的主要物资，应由各大行政区财政经济委员会统一分配，但各大行政区财政经济委员会却认为这些工厂已归中央第一机械工业部直接领导，其所需要的主要物资亦应由该部统一分配。等到最后确定各厂仍应向所在地区财政经济委员会申请分配物资时，有的地区的物资分配工作已经结束了，有的即将结束。因此，该部所属华东区各厂一月份完全没有得到国家统一分配的物资，所属西南、中南两区各厂得到的仅占实际需要的百分之二十至三十。二、需要与供应脱节。该部所属华北、东北地区各厂所需生铁，仅获得百分之六十一点五的供应，钢锭百分之三十七点六，型钢百分之七十三点四，轴钢、锻钢、弹簧钢、滚珠钢和各种铸件，也都没有得到全部解决。其它如工具机、电动机、木材的供应，也都不足。因为材料设备的供应与需要脱节，推迟了基本建设的进度。华东机械工业管理局所属各机器厂，一月份甚至一度发生停工待料的情况。
    产生以上现象的主要原因，是第一机械工业部在很长时期内没有明确究竟管理那些工厂，使该部供应局无从考虑物资供应工作。加上个别大行政区没有及时地全面地组织物资供应的申请和分配工作，以致很多工厂在分配物资时都被漏掉了。
    其次是计划不周密。该部的生产计划和基本建设计划在很长时期内不能肯定下来，一再修改。由于计划修改得太多，原来申请分配的物资有的就可能不够，有的则可能过多，或者因规格不符而没有用。如在国外订货手续已办好以后，该部第三机器工业管理局又提出追加硬质合金刀头，第四机器工业管理局提出追加工字铁、槽铁、锅炉钢板等；相反的，二○一厂已订妥车床、刨床和电动机等设备，因计划修改又申请退货。
    其三，官僚主义的作风使该部的物资分配工作更加混乱，造成一方面积压物资，一方面缺乏物资。从一九五○年到现在，该部还有一批价值五百亿元的电机产品因没有及时分配而被积压着。又如对于各厂清理仓库的物资，政务院财政经济委员会曾一再指示该部接收处理，但该部销售局却没有认真执行这项指示，使两万吨机电产品直到现在还被搁置着。今年第一季度该部作预拨订货的准备工作时，销售局派一个科长去东北调查各厂所需物资的情况。这位科长到东北后，只留在管理局里打扑克牌，而不深入厂矿去调查了解，结果只从管理局带回来一些估计数字。因此，在进行物资分配时，该部对东北地区的真实情况便无法掌握，致使严肃的物资分配会议，竟以叫卖方式进行订货。
    为了克服物资供应工作中的混乱和脱节现象，中央第一机械工业部已指示各专业管理局和各地区分局必须重视物资供应工作，对供应不足的物资，首先要各局在局的范围内进行调剂，充分利用企业现有的物资，并设法采用代用品。同时，该部又指示所属生产企业和管理机构，进行下列几项清查工作：一、清查今年第一季度预拨物资的实际订货量与不足量；二、清查今年向国外提出订货的物资种类和数量；三、清查全部库存主要物资和多余物资。
