Chongqing Yuxin Textile Factory in Sichuan Province has achieved good results by closely integrating the implementation of the Marriage Law with production during its key pilot work.

Yuxin Textile Factory had previously conducted publicity on the Marriage Law, but because the publicity was not comprehensive or in-depth, feudal remnants still prevailed among employees. Phenomena such as beating women, restricting women from participating in social activities, and interfering with freedom of marriage were quite serious. For example, among the thirty-nine married workers in the electrical repair room, thirty-seven had arranged or forced marriages. Sixty-two people in the spinning workshop had unhappy families, all caused by arranged marriages and parental control. Unmarried female workers generally looked down on pregnant women. These problems affected many employees' ability to concentrate on production. In the cloth inspection team's Group A, fourteen members of the six trade union groups had their production affected by marriage or family problems. Some workers, because of marriage and family problems, produced two or three pounds of white waste cotton a day, and large pieces of damaged cloth. Wu Deqing, a maintenance worker in the yarn workshop, was tired from fighting with his wife, dozed off at work, and had his ear injured by a machine, requiring more than a month of treatment.

The key pilot work began in early February and lasted for eighteen days. Because of adhering to the educational approach and closely integrating with production, the movement was normal and healthy from beginning to end, achieving the following results. First, it achieved widespread publicity of the Marriage Law, deeply rooted in people's hearts. Ninety-five percent of the factory's employees and their families participated in the movement and received education, resolving family and marital disputes on the basis of mass awareness. Before the movement, there were a total of four hundred and seventy-five people in the factory's employee families with unhappy families. After the movement, the problems of four hundred and forty-two people were resolved. Before the movement, ninety-four people requested divorce. After the movement, seventy-four people were willing to help each other and jointly improve their marital and family relationships and no longer requested divorce. According to incomplete statistics, more than 80% of the factory's employees and their families proposed to sign family patriotic covenants, accounting for the percentage of married people. Second, it improved the enthusiasm of employees for production, promoted production, and brought about a new atmosphere of unity, mutual assistance, and active production throughout the factory. For example, in the key production team of Wang Guolin's group in spinning section A, unmarried female workers were not united with married female workers. Married female workers were afraid of being discriminated against and did not want to be in this group. During this movement, both parties proposed guarantees of "mutual help and united production," and their production enthusiasm was greatly improved. Previously, each person watched half a machine, two hundred and twenty-four spindles. Now each person watches one section, four hundred and forty-eight spindles, increasing production efficiency by 100%. Gong Shufang's white waste cotton was reduced from two pounds to one pound. In the cloth inspection team's Group C, the ability of eight people to watch machines increased from three or four machines to six machines.

How was the movement carried out?

The entire movement was divided into three steps: The first step was to hold training classes to train cadres and understand the situation, lasting a total of eight days. Training cadres was done using three days of spare time, totaling eight or nine hours. Participants included party, Youth League, and trade union cadres at the factory, workshop, and group levels, as well as family committee members and group leaders, totaling more than seven hundred people. The main purpose was to explain the importance of implementing the Marriage Law movement in connection with production, correct their views on the movement, and organize them to conduct discussions. Typical speeches were also organized to provide enlightening education. Finally, the learning gains were summarized, and how to carry out the work was discussed, so that cadres not only recognized the purpose and direction of the movement but also knew how to carry out the movement. The second step was to publicize to the masses and widely organize the masses to study and discuss the Marriage Law (using four days of spare time, totaling eleven hours). The nature, direction, and policies of the movement were explained to all factory employees and their families to dispel their concerns, and then discussions were conducted under leadership. At the beginning of the discussion, the masses had many concerns and extremely inconsistent understandings. Therefore, men, women, married, unmarried, mothers-in-law, and husbands were separately convened for meetings for discussion, and then merged for a joint meeting, with typical figures giving speeches and conducting enlightening education targeted at various ideological concerns. At the same time, political instructors, cultural instructors, propagandists, and propaganda teams were organized to carry out publicity work together, and propaganda tools such as slideshows, movies, radio broadcasts, and blackboards were used to conduct large-scale publicity activities. The third step was to establish covenants, select models, and consolidate the achievements of the movement (using three days of spare time, totaling six hours). Family covenants or group covenants were established or revised on the basis of mass awareness and willingness. The factory held a celebration of model families, selecting one model family, nine model couples, and many models for implementing the Marriage Law. The factory was filled with joy, banners were established, and a new atmosphere emerged.

The main experience of Yuxin Textile Factory in implementing the Marriage Law closely in conjunction with production is: First, the leading cadres of the Party, Youth League, trade union, and family committee had a clear understanding of the principle of closely combining the implementation of the Marriage Law movement with production, and made reasonable arrangements in terms of publicity content, organizational strength (specific division of labor), and learning time. In terms of publicity content: at the beginning of the movement, the resounding slogan of "Carry out the Marriage Law implementation movement to remove obstacles for production" was put forward, and the importance of implementing the Marriage Law movement was repeatedly explained in connection with the factory's specific examples (examples of production being affected by feudal marriage suffering or family discord, and examples of improving production due to harmonious families and united couples). Typical speeches during the study, establishing covenants, and selecting models were all closely combined with production. In the stage of summarizing the achievements of the movement, there was also a call to "vigorously carry out production reform on the basis of the Marriage Law implementation movement." In terms of organizational strength: the secretary of the factory's Party general branch took overall leadership responsibility. Party and Youth League branch committee members and trade union committee members were responsible for leading production reform and Marriage Law implementation movements, respectively. Branch secretaries, trade union chairmen, and production committee members were responsible for production. Trade union vice-chairmen, female worker committee members, cultural and educational committee members were specifically responsible for implementing the Marriage Law movement. Propagandists were responsible for the publicity work in their contracted workshops. Trade union group leaders and female worker representatives were responsible for the groups, solving general problems raised by the masses. Individual mass problems were solved by workshop committee members through division of labor. In terms of time: the activities of the Marriage Law implementation movement were basically carried out in shifts during spare time. However, during the period of widespread publicity among the masses, political and cultural classes were suspended (new work method learning and literacy classes were not suspended).

The Yuxin Textile Factory's Marriage Law implementation movement achieved good results not only because of its close integration with production but also because of the strong leadership of the Party and the thorough preparation before the movement, which were important factors. In particular, when mobilizing family members, the mobilization slogan of "Everyone comes to learn, everyone is educated" was put forward, effectively mobilizing family members to participate in the movement and improve the relationship between workers and their families.

    重庆渝新纺织厂结合生产贯彻婚姻法
    提高了职工对婚姻问题的认识作到团结生产
    四川省重庆市渝新纺织厂在贯彻婚姻法重点试验工作中，密切结合生产，取得良好成绩。
    渝新纺织厂过去曾进行过婚姻法的宣传，但因为宣传得不全面、不深入，职工中封建残余思想仍普遍存在；打骂妇女、限制妇女参加社会活动、干涉婚姻自由的现象也相当严重。如修电间三十九个已婚工人中，有三十七人是包办强迫婚姻。细纱车间六十二人家庭不和，都是因为包办买卖婚姻和家长统治而引起的。未婚女工，一般都瞧不起孕妇。这些问题，影响到不少职工不能专心生产。布场甲班六个工会会员小组中，有十四人因婚姻或家庭问题而影响生产。有的工人因为婚姻和家庭问题，一天出两三磅白花，出大块大块的破布。纱场保全工人吴德清，因和老婆打架，身体疲倦，上班时在车间打瞌睡，耳朵被机器打坏，医治一个多月才好。
    重点试验工作二月初开始，做了十八天。由于坚持教育方针，密切结合了生产，所以从开始到结束，运动始终正常而健康，并取得以下成绩。第一，作到广泛宣传婚姻法，深入人心。全厂百分之九十五的职工及家属都参加了运动，受到了教育，在群众自觉基础上解决了家庭及婚姻纠纷。运动前，全厂职工家属中，家庭不和的共四百七十五人，经过运动有四百四十二人的问题得到解决；运动前要求离婚的九十四人，经过运动，愿意互相帮助、共同改善夫妇、家庭关系而不再要求离婚的有七十四人。据不完全统计，全厂职工家属提出要订家庭爱国公约的占已婚人数的百分之八十以上。第二，提高了职工的生产积极性，推动了生产，使全厂出现了团结互助，积极生产的新气象。如细纱甲班重点生产组王国林小组，过去未婚女工与已婚女工不团结，已婚女工怕受歧视，不愿在这个组；在这次运动中双方提出保证：“互相帮助，团结生产”，生产情绪都大大提高了。从前每人看半边车，二百二十四个锭子，现在每人看一个弄档，看四百四十八个锭子，生产效率提高了一倍。龚淑芳的白花由两磅减少到一磅。布场丙班有八人看台能力从三、四台提高到六台。
    运动怎样进行的呢？
    整个运动分为三个步骤：第一步，举办训练班训练干部，摸清情况，时间共八天。训练干部是利用三天的工余时间，共八、九小时。参加训练的有厂、车间、小组的各级党、团、工会干部及家属委员、小组长等共七百多人。主要是联系生产向他们说明贯彻婚姻法运动的重要，端正他们对运动的看法，并组织他们进行讨论。又组织了典型发言，进行启发教育。最后总结学习收获，讨论如何进行工作，使干部不仅认清了运动的目的和方针，也知道如何开展运动。第二步，向群众进行宣传，广泛组织群众学习讨论婚姻法（利用四天工余时间共十一小时），在全厂职工、家属中交代运动的性质、方针、政策，解除其顾虑，然后有领导地进行讨论。讨论开始时，群众多有顾虑，认识极不一致，于是把男、女、已婚、未婚、婆婆、丈夫分别召集会议进行讨论，然后再合并开会，由典型人物发言，针对各种思想顾虑进行启发教育。同时也组织政治教员、文化教员、宣传员、宣传队一齐进行宣传工作，又运用幻灯、电影、广播、黑板报等宣传工具，大规模地进行宣传活动。第三步，订公约，选模范，巩固运动成绩（利用三天工余时间共六小时）。在群众自觉自愿的基础上订立或修订了家庭公约或小组公约。全厂召开了庆祝模范大会，选出模范家庭一家，模范夫妻九对及贯彻婚姻法模范多人。全厂喜气洋洋，树立了旗帜，出现了新气象。
    渝新纺织厂贯彻婚姻法密切结合生产的主要经验是：首先，党、团、工会及家属委员会的领导干部，对于贯彻婚姻法运动紧密结合生产的方针有明确的认识，而且从宣传内容、组织力量（具体分工）和学习时间三方面作了合理的部署。宣传内容方面：运动一开始，就提出了“开展贯彻婚姻法运动，为生产扫除障碍”的响亮口号，并联系本厂的具体事例（因受封建婚姻痛苦或家庭不和而影响生产的实例，因家庭和睦、夫妻团结而搞好生产的事例等），反复说明贯彻婚姻法运动的重要。在学习中的典型发言、订公约、选模范，也都紧密结合生产。总结运动成绩阶段，又号召“在贯彻婚姻法运动的基础上，大力开展生产改革”。组织力量方面：工厂党总支书记负总的领导责任，党、团支部委员，工会委员，车间委员则分别掌握生产改革和贯彻婚姻法运动的领导工作：支部书记、工会正主席、生产委员掌握生产，工会副主席、女工委员、文教委员等具体掌握贯彻婚姻法运动。宣传员包干车间的宣传工作，工会小组长、女工代表掌握小组，解决群众提出的一般问题，个别群众的问题则由车间委员分工解决。时间方面：贯彻婚姻法运动的活动，基本上利用业余时间分班进行。但在群众中广泛开展宣传时期，则停止了政治、文化课等学习（新工作法学习和速成识字班学习不停止）。
    渝新纺织厂贯彻婚姻法运动所以获得良好成绩，除了因为紧密结合生产之外，党的坚强领导，运动之前的充分准备，都是重要的因素。特别是在发动家属时，提出了“人人来学习，个个受教育”的动员口号，有效地动员家属参加了运动，改善了工人和家庭的关系。
