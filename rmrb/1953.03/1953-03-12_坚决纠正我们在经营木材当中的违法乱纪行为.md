    Resolutely Correct Our Illegal and Disciplined Behavior in Timber Management
    China Coal Mine Construction Equipment Company, Hebei Provincial Branch
    The bureaucratic work style of our company's leading cadres has led to serious illegal and undisciplined behavior in the timber business of our affiliated units, causing losses to some of the country's basic construction projects. The Central Supreme People's Procuratorate inspected this issue, but we still did not pay enough attention to it. On February 22, the People's Daily criticized this matter again, and we realized the seriousness of the problem. We hereby make the following self-criticism:
    1. When selling timber, we were afraid of suffering losses, and adopted the business method of "choosing the higher price over the lower price." The Shijiazhuang Equipment Management Office sold 873.84 cubic meters of timber to the Shijiazhuang Construction Company, calculated at the average price of second-class timber, but in fact, most of it was third and fourth-class timber. The Cangxian Branch supplied Populus davidiana timber to the Bozhen Match Factory, which was originally first and second-class timber sent from the Northeast, but it was priced as first-class timber when it was sold. During settlement, a dispute arose between the two parties, and the local People's Government decided to handle it according to the grade on the Northeast shipping manifest. The leading cadres of the Cangxian Branch even believed that "the handling was too one-sided and too concessional. Why sell it for less when you can sell it for more? Isn't this a loss to the state!" Many of our cadres have failed to understand the principle that the profits of state-owned enterprises should be obtained reasonably under the principle of implementing state policies.
    2. We lack a customer service perspective. As long as users are willing to buy, we will push it out without considering anything else. If the low-quality logs in stock cannot be sold, we stipulate that buyers must match one stack of fourth-class timber with one stack of second-class timber. We only care about selling the rotten timber from the Northeast, but do not consider what bad consequences these rotten timbers will have on basic construction. We are unwilling to let buyers know the grade standards of timber from the Northeast and the yield rate of logs. The salesman of the Shijiazhuang Equipment Management Office even said to the buyer: The timber manual "is applicable to the place of origin, but not to the place of sale." Before the timber is arranged, the specifications and quality are chaotic due to improper storage. Buyers have to disassemble the stacks and select timber of the same specification and quality. After selection, they are returned to the stacks. We stipulate that this selection fee is paid by the buyer. There is also a phenomenon that the buyer pays the selection fee after the timber is arranged. This increases the buyer's burden and actually raises the price in disguise.
    3. Unclear inventory and discrepancies between accounts and goods are serious problems that exist universally in our company system. Even after commodity arrangement, some units still cannot figure out their inventory. Some units are in chaos while arranging, causing unnecessary losses to the state. Because we have not studied the timber grade and calculation methods in detail, in addition to upgrading the grade, there are also phenomena of selling at a lower grade and undercounting the volume of timber.
    4. Neglecting the life safety and welfare of workers. Timber is often loaded and unloaded at night, but the lighting equipment is insufficient. In some places, such as the South Yard of the Shijiazhuang Equipment Management Office, there is no lighting equipment at all, which makes workers feel a lot of difficulties. The workers' rest room has not been resolved in time, and the workers cannot rest well after work. What is particularly serious is that the site is too small to use, so the workers are asked to stack it high. There is a lack of tools and no research on stacking methods, resulting in constant bump injuries.
    The above-mentioned erroneous facts are inseparable from the serious bureaucratic style and supply system management thinking of our company's leading cadres. In the past, we have always emphasized coal and ignored timber in our management, thinking that timber is a secondary commodity, and did not realize the importance of timber supply to national construction. Due to ideological paralysis, we abandoned leadership responsibility in management and did not conduct inspections. We knew there were problems but turned a blind eye. We knew early on that the rotten timber from the Northeast did not meet the contract requirements, but we did not report it to the higher authorities in time, thinking that it was the country's wealth anyway, and that it was "meat rotting in the pot" anyway. Therefore, we did not carefully inspect the incoming goods. The lower levels have repeatedly reflected that the rotten timber from the Northeast is too outrageous, but we believe that this is the task given by the higher authorities, and we regard vigorously promoting rotten timber as one of our business policies. As a result, things such as raising the grade, filling good timber with inferior timber, and forcibly matching good with bad have all occurred. Our lack of concern for the suffering of workers fully illustrates that our thinking of relying on the working class is not clear. Selling rotten timber seriously harms some of the country's basic construction and shortens the life of the project. This is an unforgivable crime. In addition to making a public self-criticism and requesting the higher authorities to give us punishment, in order to improve our future work, we have adopted the following measures:
    1. During this anti-bureaucracy struggle, conduct a thorough inspection from top to bottom, mobilize the masses to carry out criticism, put forward suggestions for improvement, and reverse the past thinking of not paying attention to timber work. Leading cadres should go deep into the site to discover problems and solve them at any time. The provincial company should organize inspection teams in a planned and step-by-step manner to inspect and supervise each management unit.
    2. Strengthen the leadership of political study and business study, and improve the political and professional level of cadres. The timber grade issue should be strictly implemented in accordance with the national unified "Timber Specifications," "Timber Measurement Methods," and "Timber Volume Table" instructed by the Central Finance and Economics Committee, resolutely overcome the capitalist management thinking and supply system management thinking of "choosing the higher price over the lower price," and establish an overall concept.
    3. Find out the actual inventory figures of timber and find out the inventory. Improve the timber storage system, so as to arrange and sell at the same time, so that there will be no more chaos.
    4. According to the size of the business and the number of personnel, conduct scientific division of labor, strictly establish a system, simplify procedures, implement a layer-by-layer responsibility system, and pay attention to soliciting users' opinions to improve work.
    5. Absorb workers' opinions, improve work, and help workers study. In addition to the provincial company quickly finding ways to solve the problem of insufficient lighting equipment, building workers' rest rooms and other workers' welfare and safety issues, it should actively submit a request to the higher authorities for handling.

    坚决纠正我们在经营木材当中的违法乱纪行为
    中国煤业建筑器材公司河北省公司
    我公司领导干部的官僚主义作风，使所属单位在经营木材业务中，发生了严重的违法乱纪的行为，使国家的某些基本建设受到损失。中央最高人民检察署检查了这个问题，但我们仍未引起高度重视，二月二十二日人民日报又批评了这件事情，我们才认识到问题的严重性。特作以下几点检讨：
    一、我们在出售木材时害怕吃亏，采取了“就高不就低”的经营办法。石家庄器材经营处卖给石家庄建筑公司八七三·八四立方公尺木材，平均按二等材价格计算，但实际上大部是三、四等材。沧县支公司供给泊镇火柴厂的椵木，原是东北发来的一、二等材，在出售时均按一等材计价。在结算时双方发生争执，当地人民政府决定按东北发货单等级处理，沧县支公司领导干部还认为“处理得太片面太让步了，能多卖几个钱，为啥少卖呢，这岂不是国家吃亏吗！”我们许多干部没有领会到国营企业的利润应该在执行国家政策的原则下合理取得的道理。
    二、我们缺乏为顾客服务的观点，只要用户愿买，我们就不顾一切顺手推出。库存的质量低劣的原木卖不出去，我们就规定买主买一垛二等材，必须配搭一垛四等材。我们只顾推销东北的朽材，却不考虑这些朽材用于基本建设会发生什么恶果。我们不愿叫买主知道东北运来的木材的等级标准及原木的出材率。石家庄器材经营处业务员甚至对买主说：木材手册“适用于产地，不适用于销地”。在木材排队前，因保管不善，规格质量混乱，买主买同一种规格质量的木材，要经过拆垛选择，选出后再归垛，我们规定这笔挑选费由买主支付。木材排队后，还有挑选费用由买主出的现象。这样加大买主负担，实际上是变相的提高价格。
    三、家底不清，账货不符，是我公司系统普遍存在着的严重问题。虽经商品排队，仍有些单位摸不清家底。有的单位是边排边乱，给国家造成不应有的损失。由于我们对木材等级和计算办法没有详加研究，除提高等级外，并有降级出售及少算材积的现象。
    四、忽视工人的生命安全和工人福利。木材往往在黑夜装车卸车，但照明设备不够，有的地方，如石家庄器材经营处南货场，甚至根本没有照明设备，使工人感到很多困难。工人的休息室亦未及时解决，工人在劳动后不能很好休息。特别严重的是场地狭小不足使用，就叫工人堆高垛，既缺乏工具，又不研究堆垛方法，以致碰伤事故不断发生。
    上述种种错误事实，是与我公司领导干部的严重的官僚主义和供给制经营思想分不开的。我们过去在经营中一贯是重煤炭轻木材，认为木材是次要商品，没有认识到木材供应工作对国家建设的重要意义。由于思想麻痹，在经营上就放弃了领导责任，不去进行检查，明知有问题也听之任之。东北进关腐朽材不符合同规定，我们早就了解，但没有及时地向上级反映，认为反正是国家的财富，反正是“肉烂在锅里”，因此，对来货也不认真检查。下级曾一再反映东北腐朽材太不像话，我们却认为这是上级给的任务，把大力推销腐朽材作为我们的一条经营方针。于是提高等级、以次材充好材、硬行搭配、买好带坏等事情都发生了。我们不关心工人疾苦，充分地说明了我们依靠工人阶级的思想不明确。出售腐朽材严重地违害了国家的某些基本建设，缩短了工程寿命，这是不可原谅的罪恶。我们除作公开检讨，并请求上级给以处分外，为了改进今后的工作，特采取以下办法：
    一、在此次反官僚主义斗争中，自上而下地进行彻底检查，发动群众开展批评，提出改进意见，扭转过去不重视木材工作的思想。领导干部要深入现场发现问题随时解决。省公司应有计划、有步骤地组织检查组到各经营单位检查督促。
    二、加强政治学习和业务学习的领导，提高干部的政治与业务水平。木材等级问题要严格按照中央财政经济委员会指示的全国统一“木材规格”“木材检尺办法”“木材材积表”执行，坚决克服“就高不就低”的资本主义经营思想和供给制经营思想，树立整体观念。
    三、找出木材的实际库存数字，摸清家底。改进木材保管制度，做到边排边销，不使其再有混乱现象发生。
    四、根据业务大小，人员多寡，进行科学分工，严格建立制度，简化手续，实行层层负责制，注意征求用户意见改进工作。
    五、吸取工人意见，改进工作，并帮助工人学习。照明设备不足，修建工人休息室等等工人福利安全问题，除省公司迅速设法解决外，应积极呈请上级处理。
