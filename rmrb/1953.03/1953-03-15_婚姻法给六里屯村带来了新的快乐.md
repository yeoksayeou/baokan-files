The Marriage Law Brings New Joy to Liulitun Village
By our reporter Zhu Bo

In Liulitun Village in the eastern suburbs of Beijing, the sound of happy laughter can be heard everywhere. When the mothers-in-law are free, they all happily gather together, holding their grandchildren, boasting about the intelligence and competence of their daughters-in-law; they no longer deliberately fabricate the shortcomings of their daughters-in-law as they did in the past. In the fields and in the people's schools, the joyful songs of young men and women can be heard everywhere. There are very few cases of parents arranging marriages for their children, and the phenomenon of abusing women has basically disappeared. Many young men and women are freely choosing their partners. This is the result of the firm implementation of the Marriage Law by the cadres of Liulitun Village.

From 1952 to the present, a total of nine young men and women in the village have married after falling in love. They all succeeded after struggling with the help and support of the village cadres. For example, Li Shun and Zhang Xiurong, who got married in January of this year, often approached each other and helped each other while studying in the literacy class, and feelings arose between them. At first, when Zhang Xiurong's parents heard that their daughter wanted to find her own partner, they were so angry that they slammed the table and stamped their feet, and firmly refused. Xiurong's father threatened Xiurong, saying: "You are really disgracing the Zhang family, you don't want face, but we still want face! If you don't immediately break off contact with the Li family, you can forget about me." Xiurong's mother also said: "Child, you must listen to your father, your father is so old, if something really happens to him, can you bear it?" Xiurong was at a loss under the combined soft and hard tactics of her father and mother. She told Li Shun about this situation. The two discussed it for a long time and couldn't make up their minds, so they went to the village head and asked the village head to help them find a solution. The village head said: "Your love is your freedom, no one has the right to interfere with you. As long as you resolutely strive for freedom of marriage, you will definitely be victorious. I will persuade your father and mother." As soon as Xiurong and the others left, Xiurong's mother came to the village head again. As soon as she entered the door, she said: "Village head, what is this all about? It's embarrassing, which family's girl finds her own partner? Xiurong's father is trying to kill himself. If you don't care, what will we do if someone dies!" The village head asked her to sit down and said to her: "What do you mean 'someone dies'? Who is responsible if someone tries to die because their daughter finds her own partner? It's not like someone else harmed him. If something happens to Xiurong, someone will be responsible, and that's you who forced her!" The village head paused, and then said in a gentle tone: "Haven't you suffered enough after you got married? Why do you still want to arrange Xiurong's marriage and make her suffer for the rest of her life? Now the Marriage Law advocates freedom of marriage for men and women and does not allow parents to arrange it. Xiurong is not the only one in our village who found her own partner. Go back and persuade Xiurong's father properly." Xiurong's mother came with a fierce momentum, but after the village head said this, she was no longer angry. She said: "I also thought that arranging my children's marriages would make them unhappy and miserable for the rest of their lives, not as happy as they would be if they found their own partners. It just always feels embarrassing and shameful for a girl to find her own partner. How will she go out and see people in the future." The village head immediately said: "Finding your own partner is a legitimate thing. Only people with feudal ideas think this is embarrassing and shameful." After hearing this, Xiurong's mother's thinking was straightened out, and she promised to go back and persuade Xiurong's father properly.

In the village, as long as young people ask for help in solving marriage problems, the village cadres will do their best to support them and find solutions in a timely manner. In addition to Li Shun and Zhang Xiurong, the marriages of Liang Shumin and Yu Wenbo, Chen Changming and Ma Shuying, Zhang Shuqin and Gan Jun, and other young men and women have all been helped by the village cadres. Zhang Shuqin and Gan Jun were disrupted by their parents from the beginning of their love affair, and until she was about to get married, her parents tried to make things difficult for Zhang Shuqin. Shuqin's mother said to others: If Shuqin finds her own partner and gets married, she will not recognize her as a daughter! The village cadres have studied solutions more than once, and even considered how to arrange Shuqin's life after the Zhang family really drove her out. The village cadres said: "We can't just stand by and watch young people suffer difficulties in their struggle for freedom of marriage." With the firm support of the village cadres, this couple finally obtained their marriage certificate.

There were also some unreasonable marriages that the village cadres helped to resolve after they were discovered. There was a man named Wang Shun, who was only seventeen years old this year, but his widowed mother had arranged a marriage for him when he was thirteen years old. The girl's name was Fu Laoliu, from Mande Village. She was three years older than Wang Shun. Both the man and woman disagreed with this marriage. When the parents of both parties brought these two children to the Liulitun Village government to write a marriage application, the village cadres asked them: "Is this marriage voluntary? How old are you?" Widow Wang said: "They both agree and are old enough to get married." But Wang Shun and Laoliu didn't say a word. Seeing this situation, the village cadres called Laoliu out and asked her: "Girl, why don't you express your opinion on your own lifelong event? It's been so long since liberation, are you still feudal!" Laoliu frowned and said: "I'm not feudal at all, I don't agree, what am I supposed to say!" Then she told the village cadres about her family arranging her marriage and said: "If I didn't come today, my mother would have cried and threatened me, and insisted that I come." After learning about this situation, the village cadres came back and told the parents of both parties: "The girl does not agree with this marriage, so we cannot write a marriage application, and the man is not old enough to get married." He also combined this situation with the propaganda of the Marriage Law to persuade them not to arrange their children's marriages anymore.

"Give me the child, put the rice bowl on the stove, and I will wash it, you hurry up and go to the people's school, otherwise, the teacher will criticize you for being late again." Liu Haizhen's mother-in-law helped Liu Haizhen almost every day like this, asking her to study hard at the people's school. The two of them were as close as mother and daughter, and the neighbors were very envious of them, but Liu Haizhen's family only got better last year. There are now four people in her family: Liu Haizhen, her mother-in-law, her husband Liu Wen'an, and a little girl. In the past, the whole family did not get along: the mother-in-law always found fault with Haizhen, and she disliked Haizhen for not giving birth to a son. Liu Haizhen's husband, Liu Wen'an, was a worker and a militia member, and he was more advanced than Haizhen in politics and culture, so he disliked Haizhen for being backward and wanted to get a divorce. When the director of the village women's federation learned about this, she and the nearby activists studied the solution and mediated. They said to Haizhen's mother-in-law: "If your own daughter suffers like Haizhen after she gets married, will you feel good? Which mother doesn't love her own daughter..." They said to Wen'an: "In the past, women were not progressive because they were bound by the feudal system. If Haizhen were like you, she might be even more progressive than you. Don't look down on people! You are a worker and a militia member, you should play an exemplary role in helping Haizhen to progress..." After several persuasions, Wen'an also figured it out and decided to take the initiative to improve family unity. At the same time, the comrades of the Women's Federation also told Haizhen to take the initiative to unite with her mother-in-law and respect her mother-in-law. With the help of the Women's Federation, this family has become the harmonious family it is today.

On February 23 of this year, a divorced couple came to the village people's government office. They brought a little girl and held a divorce certificate in their hands. The man's name was Lü Changhua; the woman's name was Liu Xiuzhen. They found Jiang Jicheng, the village cadre on duty, and requested a remarriage. Liu Xiuzhen said: "Mr. Jiang, this is our divorce certificate. Return it to the People's Government and please write us a remarriage application." She put the divorce certificate on the desk and sat on the side to tell the village cadres about the divorce process.

Their marriage was arranged by their families, and they often quarreled after they got married. Changhua was a brick-burning worker who loved to drink. When he drank, he would go crazy and beat his wife. Liu Xiuzhen couldn't stand this and cursed. The two often argued and fought, and neither of them had any intention of living a life together. Changhua didn't give any money to the family when he had money, and Xiuzhen didn't bother to cook a good meal when she had grain. After several mediations by the village cadres, the problem was not solved. Finally, it went to the People's Court, and the court ruled for divorce. However, not long after the divorce, both of them regretted it. This was because they had both heard about the Marriage Law. Every time Lü Changhua heard the words "equality between men and women, mutual love and respect, harmony and unity...", he would think of his past mistakes of abusing Liu Xiuzhen. He thought of his child and realized that he had not fulfilled his obligation to raise and educate his children, and he felt very sad. When he returned home, it was cold and deserted, and he had to cook for himself after working all day. He complained that he shouldn't have gotten a divorce. What about Liu Xiuzhen? She also thought of the child's father when she saw her child and thought: "Although Changhua has made mistakes, I should help him correct them! Besides, I also have shortcomings..." Therefore, she also wanted to go back to Changhua. But she was a little self-conscious and felt embarrassed. Just when she was in a dilemma, Lü Changhua came to pick them up. Xiuzhen shed tears, and Changhua quickly comforted her: "I was wrong about the past, I can change, don't be angry anymore, hurry up and pack up and come home with me."

Lü Changhua and Liu Xiuzhen remarried, and both of them set several conditions, guaranteeing each other not to quarrel or fight, and to discuss things. Changhua and his wife unanimously expressed to the village cadres that if they still didn't live a good life, they would be sorry for the Marriage Law and the village cadres.

One day, Yan Shuying took her nephew Xiao Shengli to the village government to play, because many people wanted to see this child. Xiao Shengli is only four months old now, and he is white and fat. Everyone loves him when they see him. People say:
"If it weren't for the Marriage Law, this little guy would have been thrown into the wilderness long ago."

Xiao Shengli is an illegitimate child. The father's name is Yan Shaoxi, the mother's name is Nan Shuhua, the grandmother's name is Yan Wangshi, and the aunt's name is Yan Shuying. Nan Shuhua is Yan's child bride, and she has a good relationship with Yan Shaoxi. They had a child before they were officially married. The two were afraid that their mother would find out, and they were so worried that they cried. Nan Shuhua wanted to have the child aborted, so she rushed to do the heavy work at home, carrying water and picking manure, doing everything. But it didn't succeed. After a long time, her belly grew bigger, and everyone could see that she was pregnant. Yan Wangshi said: "This is embarrassing!" Yan Shuying also said: "What kind of shameless thing are these two doing? Why don't you go and beat them!" The family made a fuss for a day, and Yan Shaoxi was too embarrassed to go out. The neighbors also argued everywhere: "This is the virtue of the Yan family! Why don't you quickly abort the child and throw it into the wilderness to feed the dogs!" Many people even ignored the Yan family. Nan Shuhua's aunt and Shuhua walked in opposite directions and twisted their heads and passed by. Yan Shaoxi's aunt scolded Nan Shuhua when she saw her, "Shameless!" The family was very painful. Yan Wangshi still said: "I'll go find the village cadres and see if they can help us find a solution."

Yan Wangshi went to the home of the village cadre Liu Yuzhen. She said: "Auntie, it's my shame! Shaoxi, that damn kid, and Shuhua, got pregnant! What do you think we should do? Punish them if they should be punished." She paused and sighed: "Alas! This is really the virtue of the Yan family!" Liu Yuzhen said: "Who should we punish? If you have a child, just give birth to it." Yan Wangshi said: "You make it sound easy. How can you have a child before you're married?" Liu Yuzhen told her to go back and comfort Shuhua properly, and not to let Shuhua think too much and make a mistake. When it came to Shuhua and Shaoxi's affair, Liu Yuzhen said: Although this matter is not good, we can only educate them properly! Liu Yuzhen repeatedly told Yan Wangshi: "The Marriage Law stipulates the protection of illegitimate children. Illegitimate children are also members of the country and society. No one can throw the child away."

The village cadres not only told the Yan family the truth, but also persuaded the masses who advocated throwing away the child.

In October of last year, Nan Shuhua was due to give birth. The whole family prepared things for Shuhua and the unborn baby, and also hired a midwife named Bei to deliver the baby. Yan Wangshi said: "This is the first child, we should be more careful." The child was born, and the whole family was very happy. They named the child "Shengli", meaning that now that the Marriage Law is implemented, his little life has achieved victory.

In Liulitun Village, because the village cadres conscientiously implemented the Marriage Law, there are many more touching stories. There are dozens of young men and women who are in love; there are child brides who have suffered for more than ten years and widows who have guarded for more than ten years, who have now found their satisfactory husbands. Now, the village cadres are further examining their thinking in connection with the Marriage Law, preparing to continue to carry out the movement of extensively publicizing the Marriage Law throughout the village, so that the Marriage Law can be implemented better.

### 婚姻法给六里屯村带来了新的快乐

    婚姻法给六里屯村带来了新的快乐
    本报记者　朱波
    在北京市东郊六里屯村，到处都能听到人们欢乐的笑声。婆婆们闲了的时候，都抱着孙子愉快地聚在一起，互相夸耀着自己儿媳妇的聪明和能干；再也不像过去那样没事就故意编排儿媳妇的短处了。在田野里和民校里，到处都可以听到青年男女们愉快的歌声。父母包办子女婚姻的事件很少了，虐待妇女的现象也基本上没有了。许多青年男女都在自由选择自己的对象。这是六里屯村干部坚决执行婚姻法的结果。
    从一九五二年到现在，村里经过恋爱结婚的青年男女共有九对，他们都是在村干部的帮助和支持下经过斗争而成功的。如在今年一月份结婚的李顺和张秀荣，就是在速成识字班学习时，经常接近，互相帮助，双方产生了感情的。起初，张秀荣的父母听说自己的女儿要自找对象，都气得拍桌子打板凳的，坚决不允许。秀荣的爸爸威胁秀荣说：“你真给张家丢人，你不要脸我们还要脸哩！你要不马上和李家断绝来往，就有你没我。”秀荣的妈妈也说：“孩子，你要听你爸爸的话呀，你爸爸这样大年纪了，要真有个三长两短，你能忍得下心吗？”秀荣在她爸爸和妈妈的软硬夹攻下，没有主意了。她把这个情况告诉李顺。两人商量了很长时间，拿不定主意，于是他们就去找村长，要求村长帮助想办法。村长说：“你俩恋爱是你们的自由，谁也没有权利干涉你们，只要自己坚决争取婚姻自由，就一定能胜利，你爸爸和妈妈，我去劝一劝他们。”秀荣她们刚走，秀荣妈又找村长来了。她一进门就说：“村长，这算什么事呀，丢人嫌眼的，谁家的姑娘自己找对象呀？秀荣她爸爸寻死觅活的，你们要不管，出了人命可怎么办哪！”村长让她坐下来，对她说：“出什么人命？因为自己的姑娘自己找对象寻死，这要谁负责呢？又不是别人害他。如果秀荣有些好歹，倒是有人要负责任，那就是你们逼的！”村长停了停，又用缓和的口气说：“你结婚以后受气还没有受够？为什么还想包办秀荣的婚事，叫她也受一辈子气？现在婚姻法提倡男女婚姻自由，不允许家长包办。咱们村里自己找对象的又不是秀荣一个人。回去好好地劝说劝说秀荣爸爸。”秀荣妈来的时候气势汹汹，经村长这么一说，没有气了，她说：“我也想到包办孩子的亲事叫她们不如意，苦苦楚楚地过一辈子，没有她们自己找的对心思。就是老感觉姑娘自己找对象丢人嫌眼，以后怎么出门子见人哪。”村长紧接着说：“自己找对象是光明正大的事，有封建思想的人才认为这是丢人嫌眼的事哩。”秀荣妈经这一说，思想搞通了，她答应回去好好劝一劝秀荣的爸爸。

    在村里，只要青年要求帮助解决婚姻问题，村干部都以全力支持，及时地想办法解决。除李顺和张秀荣外，还有梁淑敏和于文波、陈长明和马淑英、张淑琴和甘俊等男女青年的婚姻，都得到了村干部的帮助。张淑琴和甘俊，从恋爱开始就遭到家长的破坏，直到她要结婚时，家长想办法难为张淑琴。淑琴她妈对人说：如果淑琴自己找对象结了婚，就不认她是女儿！村干部曾不只一次地研究解决办法，甚至连张家真要把淑琴赶出来以后，怎样安排淑琴生活的办法都考虑到了。村干部说：“不能眼看着青年们在争取婚姻自由时遭受困难不管。”在村干部坚决支持下，这对青年终于领了结婚证。
    还有些不合理的婚姻，村干部发现后也帮助解决了。有个叫王顺的，今年才十七岁，可是他的寡妇妈妈早在他十三岁时就给他订下一门亲事。女的叫傅老六，漫地村人。比王顺大三岁。男女双方都不同意这门亲事。双方家长带着这两个孩子到六里屯村政府写结婚申请书时，村干部问他们“结婚是不是自愿的？多大岁数？”王寡妇说：“他们两个都同意，都够结婚的岁数了。”可是王顺和老六一句话也不说。村干部看到这种情况，就把老六叫出来问她说：“姑娘，你自己的终身大事怎么不发表意见呢？解放这样长时间了，你还封建哪！”老六绉着眉说：“我一点都不封建，我不同意，叫我说什么呀！”接着又把家庭包办她的亲事的经过告诉村干部，并说：“今天我不来，我妈连哭带吓唬，非叫我来不可。”村干部了解了这个情况，就回来告诉双方的家长：“姑娘不同意这门亲事，不能写结婚申请书，而且男方还不到结婚年龄。”他又结合着这情况宣传婚姻法，说服她们，不要再包办子女的婚姻。
    “把孩子给我，把饭碗放在锅台上我来洗刷，你赶快上民校吧，要不，老师又该批评你迟到了。”刘海珍的婆婆差不多每天都这样帮助刘海珍，要她到民校好好学习。她娘俩好得像母女似的，邻居们都非常羡慕她们，但刘海珍家是在去年才好起来的。她家现在共四口人，刘海珍、婆婆、丈夫刘文安和一个小女孩。过去全家人都不对脾气：婆婆成天挑海珍的毛病，她嫌海珍不生男孩子。刘海珍的丈夫刘文安是个工人，又是民兵，不论在政治上、文化上都比海珍进步快，因此他嫌海珍落后，想离婚。村妇联会主任知道了，就和附近的积极分子一起研究办法，进行调解。她们对海珍的婆婆说：“如果你的亲女儿出嫁以后像海珍一样受气，你心里好受吗？谁家的妈妈不疼自己的姑娘……。”她们对文安说：“过去妇女不进步都是受封建制度的束缚，如果海珍也像你一样，说不定比你还进步哩。不要看不起人！自己是工人，又是民兵，应该起模范作用帮助海珍进步才对……。”经过几次劝说，文安也想通了，决心主动地搞好家庭团结。同时，妇联会的同志又告诉海珍，要她主动地团结婆婆，尊敬婆婆。这一家经过妇联会的帮助，就变成现在这个和睦的家庭了。
    今年二月二十三日，村人民政府办公室来了一对离了婚的夫妇，他们带着一个小女孩，手里拿着离婚证书。男的叫吕长华；女的叫刘秀珍。他们找到值班的村干部姜纪城，要求复婚。刘秀珍说：“姜先生，这是我们的离婚证书，退给人民政府，请给我们写一张复婚申请书。”她把离婚证书放在办公桌上，就坐在一边把离婚的经过告诉给村干部听。
    他俩是家庭包办结婚的，结婚后时常吵闹。长华是个烧砖的工人，爱喝酒，喝了酒就发酒疯打老婆。刘秀珍不受这个气，就骂。两个人经常吵嘴打架，谁也没心思过日子。长华有了钱也不给家里，秀珍是有了粮食也不好好做一顿饭吃，经过村干部几次调解，都没有解决问题。最后闹到人民法院，经法院判决离婚。但是，离婚不久，两个人都后悔了。这是因为他们都听到了婚姻法。吕长华每次听到“男女平等、互爱互敬、和睦团结……”这些字句时，就想起自己过去虐待刘秀珍的错误。他想起孩子，想到自己没有尽到抚养教育子女的义务，心里非常难过。回到家里冷冷清清，做一天活还要自己做饭吃。他抱怨自己不该离婚。刘秀珍呢？也看见自己的孩子就想起孩子的爸爸，心里想：“长华虽然有错误，我也应该帮助他改正呀！再说，自己也有缺点……。”因此，她也想回到长华那里去。但是又有些爱面子，觉得不好意思。正在左右为难的时候，吕长华接她们来了。秀珍流出了眼泪，长华连忙安慰她：“过去的事情是我错了，我能改过，不要再生气了，快收拾收拾和我回家吧。”
    吕长华和刘秀珍复婚了，两个人都订了几个条件，互相保证不吵嘴不打架，有事情商量着办。长华夫妇一致向村干部表示，再要过不好日子，就对不起婚姻法，也对不起村干部。

      一天，阎淑英抱着她的侄子小胜利，到村政府去玩，因为有很多人要看看这个孩子。小胜利现在才四个月，长得白白胖胖，谁见了都心爱。人们说：
    “要不是婚姻法，这小家伙早给扔到野地里了。”
    小胜利是个非婚生子，爸爸叫阎少喜，妈妈叫南淑华，奶奶叫阎王氏，姑姑叫阎淑英。南淑华是阎家的童养媳，和阎少喜感情很好。他们在没有正式结婚以前，有了小孩。两人怕妈妈知道，愁得没办法，哭了一场。南淑华想叫小孩掉下来，就抢着做家里的重活，担水挑粪，什么都干。但是没有成功。时间长了，肚子大了，大家都看出是有小孩了。阎王氏说：“这可该丢人哩！”阎淑英也说：“这两个人怎么办这种没脸的事，还不去打他们！”一家人闹了一天，阎少喜也不好意思出门了。街房邻居们也吵遍了：“这是阎家的德行！还不赶快打掉扔到野地里喂狗！”很多人连阎家的人都不理了。南淑华的姨母和淑华走对头，扭了扭头就过去了。阎少喜的婶子见了南淑华就骂“缺德！”一家人非常痛苦。还是阎王氏说：“我去找找村干部，看他们能不能给想办法。”
    阎王氏到了村干部刘玉贞家里，她说：“他大婶，该我丢人哩！少喜那个死不了的孩子和淑华闹的有了孩子啦！你看怎么办吧？该处罚他们就处罚他们。”停了停她叹了口气：“唉！这真是阎家的德行！”刘玉贞说：“处罚谁呀？有了孩子就生吧。”阎王氏说：“你倒说得好听。还没有结婚就生孩子，怎么能行呢？”刘玉贞告诉她，要她回去好好安慰淑华，不要叫淑华想不开出了差错。说到淑华和少喜的事情时，刘玉贞说：这事虽然不好，可是也只可以好好教育一下！刘玉贞最后再三告诉阎王氏：“婚姻法规定保护非婚生子，非婚生子也是国家社会的一分子，谁也不能把孩子给扔了。”
    村干部不但把道理告诉了阎家，还说服了那些主张扔孩子的群众。
    去年十月里，南淑华到生产期了，全家都给淑华和未生婴儿准备东西，并且还请了一个姓贝的助产士接生。阎王氏说：“这是头一个小孩，应该多加小心。”孩子生下来了，一家都非常愉快。她们给孩子起名字叫“胜利”，意思是说现在实行婚姻法，他的小生命取得了胜利。
    在六里屯村，因为村干部认真地贯彻执行了婚姻法，还有很多动人的故事。有几十对男女青年正在恋爱；有受了十几年折磨的童养媳和守了十多年的寡妇，现在找到了自己如意的丈夫。现在，村干部又都联系婚姻法进一步检查自己的思想，准备在全村继续深入展开宣传婚姻法的运动，使婚姻法执行得更好。
