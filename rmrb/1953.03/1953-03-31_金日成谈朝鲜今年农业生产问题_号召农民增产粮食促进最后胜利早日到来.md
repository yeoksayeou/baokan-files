Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 30th. Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, recently met with model farmers and representatives of military families from Sukchon, Sunan, Pyongwon, Anju, and Daedong counties in South Pyongan Province, as well as some party and government leaders from the villages, and held talks on North Korea's agricultural production issues for this year. In his speech, Kim Il-sung instructed the farmers to increase the production of more grain and raw materials, develop animal husbandry, to promote the final victory of the war.

    Kim Il-sung said: Last year, thanks to the Korean farmers overcoming various wartime difficulties and displaying a high degree of patriotic labor enthusiasm, and also thanks to the state providing assistance to some farmers, especially military families and poor farmers, such as exempting them from in-kind taxes and providing loans for seeds and grain, Korean farmers achieved excellent results in agricultural production. The country's grain situation has greatly improved, and the country's supply of grain to the People's Army and the rationing of grain to workers, staff, and their families have greatly improved. Therefore, the people's confidence in victory has become more solid. This year, the Workers' Party of Korea and the Republic Government have also put forward the task for farmers to supply the front and rear with grain, fully guarantee industrial raw materials, and further stabilize the people's lives. Farmers must mobilize all their strength to complete this task and strive for greater harvests. Kim Il-sung pointed out in his speech: In this year's struggle to do a good job in spring sowing and increase agricultural production, there are still difficulties in terms of manpower, animal power, and fertilizer, and we must also consider the enemy's harassment and sabotage. All farmers and all people must launch a nationwide movement to overcome these difficulties. Then, Kim Il-sung gave detailed instructions on all aspects of agricultural production.

    He particularly emphasized that farmers should fully promote the spirit of mutual assistance in the production increase campaign and launch production competitions between villages, counties, and provinces. All the people, including the army, workers, staff, and citizens, should also extensively help farmers in their production. He instructed people's governments at all levels to further vigorously support the farmers' struggle to increase production, exert creativity, and help farmers solve problems they cannot solve themselves. The Party, the government, and other farmers should all care for and help the production of poor farmers and military families.

    Kim Il-sung also pointed out: In order to solve the need for meat, the political organs should organize farmers to develop animal husbandry, mainly pig breeding, starting this year, so that every household will have livestock in the next two or three years.

    Kim Il-sung pointed out a favorable condition for developing agricultural production, saying: The number of tractors we are now using has increased compared to before the war. This year, tractors and thousands of pieces of farm equipment and automobiles shipped from the Soviet Union have also been used in agricultural production. Tens of thousands of tons of chemical fertilizers imported from the Soviet Union are also being distributed to farmers for use.

    Kim Il-sung finally said: I am confident that all our farmers, under the leadership of the people's governments, will overcome all difficulties, complete the task of increasing production, develop animal husbandry, produce more grain for the front and rear, produce more raw materials for industrial production, and promote the early arrival of the final victory.

    金日成谈朝鲜今年农业生产问题
    号召农民增产粮食促进最后胜利早日到来
    【新华社平壤三十日电】朝鲜劳动党中央委员会委员长、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成，最近接见了平安南道肃川、顺安、平原、安州、大同等郡的丰产农民及军属代表和一部分里的党、政负责人，就朝鲜今年度的农业生产问题进行了谈话。金日成在谈话中指示农民们要增产更多的粮食与原料，发展家畜业，来促进战争的最后胜利。
    金日成说：在去年，由于朝鲜农民克服了战时的各种困难，高度发挥了爱国劳动热情，也由于国家对部分农民特别是对军属及贫苦农民给予了免征现物税和贷种子、贷粮食等帮助，朝鲜农民在农业生产上获得了优异的成果。国家的粮食情况有了很大的好转，国家对人民军供给粮食以及对工人、职员和他们的家属配给粮食的情况，都大大地改善了。因而，全国人民的胜利信心也更加巩固了。今年，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府对于农民也提出了供给前后方以粮食、充分保障工业原料和进一步安定人民生活的任务。农民们要动员自己的一切力量，来完成这个任务，争取更多的收获。金日成在谈话中指出：在今年做好春播工作、增加农业生产的斗争中，在人力、畜力和肥料方面仍然存在困难，而且还要考虑到敌人的骚扰和破坏。全体农民和全体人民必须展开一个全人民的运动来克服这些困难。接着，金日成对农业生产的各个方面作了详尽的指示。
    他特别强调指出，农民们在增产运动中要充分发扬互助的精神，要在里与里、郡与郡、道与道之间展开生产竞赛。全体人民，包括军队、工人、职员和市民，也要广泛地帮助农民进行生产。他指示各级人民政权机关要进一步大力支援农民的增产斗争，发挥创造性，帮助农民解决他们自己解决不了的问题。党和政府以及其他农民都要关心和帮助贫苦农民和军属的生产。
    金日成又指出：为了自己解决肉类的需要，政权机关要从今年起组织农民发展以养猪为主的家畜业，使每家农户在今后两三年内都有家畜。
    金日成指出在发展农业生产上的一个有利条件说：我们现在使用的拖拉机已比战前增加了。今年从苏联运来的拖拉机和数千件农具和汽车也已经使用到农业生产方面。从苏联输入的几万吨化学肥料，也正在分配给农民使用。
    金日成最后说：我确信：我们全体农民在人民政权机关的领导下，必将克服一切困难，完成增产任务，发展家畜业，为前后方生产更多的粮食，为工业生产更多的原料，促进最后胜利早日到来。
