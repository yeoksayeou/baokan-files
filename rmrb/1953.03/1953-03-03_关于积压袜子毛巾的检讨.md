    Self-Criticism Regarding the Stockpiling of Socks and Towels
    China Department Store, Wuhan City Company

    The People's Daily's criticism on January 23rd that "Wuhan City Department Store, under the erroneous instructions of the local Finance Committee and Bureau of Industry and Commerce, blindly commissioned handicrafts processing, resulting in the stockpiling of a large number of socks and towels" is entirely correct. To deeply recognize the error of stockpiling goods and improve future work, we convened a meeting of department heads and directors of the company to conduct discussions and made the following self-criticism.

    We have deficiencies in policy and business learning, and poor management, resulting in a serious phenomenon of commodity stockpiling. In order to support local handicraft production, we only focused on commissioning processing, but did not urge these artisans to improve product quality, nor did we conduct in-depth investigations into people's needs. In terms of operating methods, we were "passively waiting for customers," without organizing sales to rural areas, nor establishing trade relations with cooperatives and private merchants, resulting in a shrinking sales market. In addition, the salespersons in the stores generally had a mentality of preferring brand-name goods, were unwilling to display commissioned socks and towels in the windows, and were even less willing to promote them verbally. When customers wanted to select goods, they were unhappy. Some rural peddlers brought goods to the market in the morning and were eager to purchase goods and return to their hometowns in the afternoon. At that time, there were many shortcomings in our store sales, and the counters were often very crowded, so they could not get close and did not buy. All of this shows that we have not yet served consumers well.

    This matter also shows that we failed to report the situation in a timely manner, propose and adhere to correct opinions, so that errors could not be corrected in time. In the first half of 1952, during the "Three-Anti" Movement, it was discovered that there was a serious phenomenon of mildew and deterioration of stockpiled goods in the warehouse. In the second half of the year, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce notified us to resume processing business. We knew that this would stockpile more goods and increase the country's losses, but we only voiced our opinions verbally. Afterwards, we did not further analyze the situation, propose, and insist on improving the commissioned processing. We only obeyed orders and passively resisted, thus producing a series of problems such as producers stopping work and waiting for materials.

    Now, our processing of socks and towels has been transferred to the state-owned Wuhan Department Store Wholesale Station. In order to learn from the past lessons of stockpiling goods caused by commissioned processing, improve our policy and business levels, and strengthen the sense of responsibility of staff, in addition to circulating the criticism materials to various units, we offer the above self-criticism.

    关于积压袜子毛巾的检讨
    中国百货公司武汉市公司
    一月二十三日人民日报对于“武汉市百货公司在当地财委和工商局的错误指示下，盲目委托手工业加工积压大批袜子毛巾”的批评，是完全正确的。为了深刻地认识积压商品的错误和改善今后的工作，我们召开了公司科长、主任以上干部会议，进行了讨论，作出了如下检讨。
    我们对政策、业务学习差，经营管理不善，造成了商品的严重积压现象。为了扶持当地手工业生产，我们只顾委托加工，但没有督促这些手工业者提高产品的质量，也没有深入调查人民的需要。在经营方式上又是“坐等顾客”，没有组织下乡推销，也没有和合作社、私商建立买卖关系，以致销售面越来越小。加上门市部的营业员普遍存在名牌货思想，不愿意在橱窗里陈列委托加工的袜子、毛巾，更不愿多作口头宣传，碰到顾客要挑选商品，还不高兴。有些乡村行贩，上午带货上市，下午急于购货返乡，当时我们门市部售货存在很多缺点，柜台上经常十分拥挤，他们挤不上，也就不买了。这都说明我们还没有很好地为消费者服务。
    这件事情，也说明我们不能及时反映情况，提出并坚持正确意见，使错误不能及时得到纠正。一九五二年上半年“三反”运动中，已发现仓库积压的商品有霉损变质的严重现象。下半年工商局通知我们恢复加工业务，我们明知这样会积压更多商品，加重国家的损失，但是我们只在口头上提出意见。以后就没有进一步地分析情况，提出和坚持改进委托加工的意见，我们只是奉令照办，消极抵抗，因此产生了生产者停工待料等一连串的问题。
    现在我们的加工袜子、毛巾的工作已移交国营武汉百货批发站。为了接受过去委托加工造成商品积压的教训，提高我们的政策、业务水平，加强工作人员责任心，除将批评材料通报各单位外，特检讨如上。
