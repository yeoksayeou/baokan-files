    A Couplet
    Shen Shi
    A couplet, pompously posted on the gate of the Piaoli Purchasing Group of the Guangxi Province Oil and Fat Company in Longsheng County.
    The upper line reads: Grasp price fluctuations promptly, be reasonable and considerate;
    The lower line reads: Vigorously purchase local products, without rushing.
    It was originally a good thing that the Oil and Fat Company set up a purchasing group in Piaoli to promptly purchase tung oil and tea oil from local Zhuang and Dong farmers, so as to prevent them from suffering excessive intermediate exploitation by merchants.
    However, when the purchasing group buys oil from farmers, they always draw a bowl of oil from each load to test the acidity. If the acidity does not meet the standard, they refuse to buy it. Liang Qingsheng, a farmer from Simei Township in the county, carried fifty catties of tea oil to sell. After testing, it was said that the acidity reached twelve degrees, and he could not sell his oil. On the same day, his younger brother sold the same oil, but the acidity was only seven degrees. Liang Fucai from Sanjie Village wanted to sell sixty catties of tea oil, but the purchasing group said: "The acidity has reached seventy degrees, we can't buy it." Later, Liang Fucai entrusted someone else to sell the sixty catties of oil. The same oil, only the person carrying the oil was changed, but the acidity became five degrees. Many farmers carry dozens of catties of oil, walking dozens of miles, only to return empty-handed because of such "acidity." They say: Carrying oil to Piaoli, it cannot be sold, and the food expenses are spent. Carrying it back, it cannot be eaten up, and it cannot be used for bathing, so it can only be poured into the river to feed the fish. This is how the Piaoli Purchasing Group "reasonably and considerately" purchases oil from farmers.
    The sun rises high, but the gate of the purchasing group is still not open. The people in the group often go to nearby barber shops to play chess and play poker, leaving the people who come to sell oil waiting outside for a long time. The farmers say: In the past, the trade company even engaged in other businesses, and collected 8,000 catties of oil a day. The oil purchasing group specializes in collecting oil, but it cannot collect 5,000 catties a day. This is how "unhurriedly" the purchasing group personnel handle affairs.
    Just as these gentlemen are reveling in their "unhurried" and "reasonable" behavior, the local farmers saw the couplet and changed it by word of mouth:
    One load of oil, deduct ten taels, reasonable and considerate.
    Open the door at ten o'clock, without rushing.
    Such a situation is not limited to the Piaoli Purchasing Group of the Guangxi Province Oil and Fat Company. In the countryside, in factories, and in government agencies, as long as a thorough inspection is carried out, there will certainly be people who are similarly "unhurried," and there will certainly be things that are similarly "reasonable."

### 一副对联

    一副对联
    沈石
    一副对联，冠冕堂皇地张贴在广西省油脂公司龙胜县瓢里收购组的大门上。
    上联是：及时掌握牌价，入情入理；
    下联是：大力收购土产，不慌不忙。
    油脂公司在瓢里设立收购小组，及时地收购当地僮、侗各族农民的桐油和茶油，以免他们遭受商贩过重的中间剥削，这本来是件好事情。
    但是，收购组买农民的油时，每担总要抽出一碗去化验酸度，如果酸度不合标准就拒绝收买。该县四梅乡的农民梁庆胜挑五十斤茶油来卖，经化验后，说酸度到了十二度，他的油便卖不出去。在同一天，他的弟弟出售同样的油，酸度却只有七度。三界村的梁福材，要卖出六十斤茶油，收购组的人说：“酸度到了七十度，不能买。”后来梁福材将这六十斤油，托别人去卖。同样的油，只换了一个挑油的人，酸度却变成五度了。许多农民挑几十斤油，走几十里路，仅仅因为这样的“酸度”，经常徒劳往返。他们说：挑油到瓢里，卖不脱，伙食又花了，挑回去，吃又吃不完，拿去洗澡，又洗不得，只有倒在河里去喂鱼。瓢里收购组就是这样“入情入理”地收购农民的油的。
    太阳升得好高了，收购组的大门还没打开，组里的人经常到附近的理发馆去下象棋，玩扑克，却让挑油来卖的人在门外久等。农民们说：过去贸易公司连干其他的买卖，一天收八千斤油。油脂收购组专门收油，一天收不到五千斤。收购组的人员办起事来就是这样“不慌不忙”的。
    正当这些老爷们陶醉在他们的“不慌不忙”和
    “入情入理”的时候，当地的农民看到了那副对联，一传十、十传百地把它改为：
    一担油，抽十两，入情入理。
    十点钟，才开门，不慌不忙。
    这样的情形，并不限于广西省油脂公司的瓢里收购小组。在农村、在工厂、在机关中，只要深入地进行检查，不会没有类似这样“不慌不忙”的人，也不会没有类似这样“入情入理”的事。
