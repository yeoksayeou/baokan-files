The North China Administrative Committee convened a regional agricultural and forestry work conference from January 23rd to February 3rd. The conference earnestly summarized the experiences in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in 1952, determined the working guidelines and tasks for 1953, drafted specific work plans for mutual aid and cooperation, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy, and adopted decisions on strengthening political and production leadership for agricultural labor models, on strengthening agricultural technical work, promoting science and technology and advanced experiences, and on strengthening forestry work.

The conference determined that the main tasks of agricultural production in the North China region in 1953 are: to continue developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the patriotic production increase movement on the basis of the production in 1952, vigorously promote advanced experiences and science and technology, mobilize the masses to prevent and combat drought and other disasters, continue to increase yield per unit area, so as to increase the production of grain, industrial raw materials, and goods for export, and pay attention to vigorously developing forestry and animal husbandry. This year, grain production is required to increase by 12.8 percent on the basis of 1952, and cotton production is to increase by 13.2 percent while maintaining the existing cotton field area.

The conference determined that the tasks of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in 1953 are: to consolidate and develop mutual aid teams, actively and steadily establish agricultural producers' cooperatives, and focus on piloting several collective farms. It is required that 80 percent of farmers be organized, with mutual aid teams operating year-round striving to reach half of the total, and agricultural producers' cooperatives planned to develop to about 10,000. The conference focused on studying the current imbalanced development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the formalism existing in some areas. For example, in Shanxi Province, the best-performing counties have organized over 96 percent of the labor force, while the worst-performing counties are below 20 percent. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen leadership in weak areas and promote the experiences of advanced areas to gradually balance the development of the movement. The conference also criticized the tendency in some areas to underestimate the leadership of mutual aid teams and the tendency to be greedy for quick results in developing agricultural producers' cooperatives; it pointed out that mutual aid teams are the foundation of agricultural producers' cooperatives and must be strengthened; agricultural producers' cooperatives should still adhere to the principle of "only allowing good management, not allowing bad management."

Based on the experience of bumper harvests in 1952, the conference focused on studying the promotion of advanced experiences and science and technology, and summarized the experiences of high yields of five major crops, including wheat, cotton, and millet, and established banners for high yields of the five major crops, requiring all localities to exchange and promote these experiences in light of local conditions. The conference also proposed that all technical personnel must go deep into the masses, connect with the masses, summarize the experiences of the masses, give scientific explanations, and widely carry out technical education in various ways.

At the conclusion of the conference, Liu Lantao, Chairman of the North China Administrative Committee, made important instructions. After elaborating in detail on the tasks of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, economic construction, and democratic construction in 1953 and their interrelationships, he focused on explaining the relationship between industrial and agricultural production. He said: In national construction, industry is the decisive and leading factor, while agriculture is necessary. National construction focuses on industry, but industrial production and agricultural production must cooperate and support each other under the unified national plan. The more industry develops, the more it needs the development of agriculture; the new development of agriculture also needs the leadership and support of industry. It is wrong not to recognize the decisive and leading role of industry, but it is also wrong to neglect agricultural production because of this. Focusing on industry is in terms of the overall national construction policy, and this policy should be implemented in all aspects, but it cannot be mechanically applied without considering the specific situation. For example, the county-level Party committees and county people's governments should be the organizers and leaders of agricultural production in their localities, and their main task is to lead agricultural production. Strengthening agricultural production is also strengthening the work of national industrialization. Liu Lantao emphasized that the main requirements for agricultural production this year are still to increase the production of grain, industrial raw materials, and goods for export, and at the same time, it is necessary to actively pay attention to the development of forestry and animal husbandry; as for the current unified proposal of the slogan "comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry" throughout the region, it is premature and inappropriate.

Based on the central instructions and the current situation in the rural areas of North China, Liu Lantao pointed out that it is necessary to adopt a policy of relying on organized farmers, supporting poor farmers, uniting individual farmers and other working people, and restricting the exploitation of rich peasants in the countryside. He said: In the rural areas of North China, the better organized the area, the smaller the class differentiation. For example, in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, where over 96 percent are organized, the living standards of farmers have generally improved, and there is little class differentiation in the countryside. The Party and government leaders there have fulfilled their responsibilities to the masses of farmers. However, in other areas, due to the laissez-faire attitude of the local Party and government leading organs towards the development of the rural economy, a considerable number of farmers have sold their land and gradually fallen into poverty in a short period of time after the land reform. Helping poor farmers is our due responsibility, and we cannot be indifferent to the difficulties of poor farmers. We must do everything possible to make them work hard to produce and improve their lives. Liu Lantao pointed out that the transition from scattered individual farmers to mutual aid teams, agricultural producers' cooperatives, and then to collective farms is a long and arduous process with its own laws, and subjectivism should not be committed in guiding it. In general, do not attempt to jump from individual operation to agricultural producers' cooperatives at once. Regardless of new or old areas, the consciousness of farmers is gradually improved, and everything depends on our work and leadership. It is wrong to take a cold and negative attitude towards organizing, and it is also wrong to be greedy for quick results. We should proceed step by step in accordance with the laws of rural economic development and not have any coercion. Liu Lantao emphasized that it is necessary to strengthen the political and ideological education of farmers. He said: Educating farmers on the direction of rural economic development and on patriotism and collectivism, and establishing the concept of patriotism as glorious and labor as glorious, should become a long-term task for rural workers to educate farmers; at the same time, it is necessary to educate the masses of farmers on the unity of national interests and individual interests, and the unity of national industrialization interests and farmers' interests, so that the masses of farmers can carry out agricultural construction according to the national plan, and make them understand that the interests of national industrialization are the greatest interests of the vast majority of the people. And educate farmers that at present, they should mainly rely on their own collective strength to run various production undertakings, and do not promote unrealistic slogans among farmers.

Finally, Liu Lantao emphasized the issue of cultivating and educating labor models. He said: There are about 60,000 labor models in the region, which is a strong shock force on the agricultural production front. They have made contributions, but due to the bureaucracy of some leading organs, there is only commendation for labor models and a lack of due criticism and education, resulting in some labor models becoming arrogant and complacent and divorced from the masses. This year, all localities must strengthen the ideological and political education of labor models, with encouragement and criticism, to help them continuously progress and enable them to play a greater role.

    华北行政委员会召开农林工作会议
    刘澜涛主席号召加强农业生产领导支援国家工业建设
    华北行政委员会一月二十三日至二月三日召开了全区农林工作会议。会议认真总结了一九五二年农业、林业、畜牧业方面的经验，确定了一九五三年的工作方针和任务，拟订了关于互助合作、农业、林业、畜牧、水利等具体工作方案，通过了关于加强对农业劳动模范的政治领导和生产领导的决定、关于加强农业技术工作、推广科学技术和先进经验的决定、关于加强林业工作的决定。
    会议确定一九五三年华北区农业生产的主要任务是：在一九五二年的生产基础上，继续发展互助合作运动和爱国增产运动，大力推广先进经验与科学技术，发动群众防旱、抗旱、防灾，继续提高单位面积产量，以增产粮食、工业原料和外销物资，并注意大力发展林业、牧业。今年要求粮食产量在一九五二年的基础上提高百分之十二点八，棉花产量在维持现有棉田面积的基础上提高百分之十三点二。
    会议确定一九五三年互助合作运动的任务是：巩固发展互助组，积极、稳步地建立农业生产合作社，重点试办几个集体农庄。要求组织起来的农户达到百分之八十，其中常年互助组争取达到半数，农业生产合作社计划发展到一万个左右。会议着重研究了当前互助合作运动发展的不平衡状态和某些地区所存在着的形式主义现象。如山西省工作最好的县份组织起来的劳动力达到劳动力总数的百分之九十六以上，工作不好的县份则不及百分之二十，为此，必须加强对薄弱地区的领导，推广先进地区的经验，以使运动逐渐平衡发展。会议又批判了某些地区所存在着的轻视互助组的领导，和发展农业生产合作社中的贪多冒进偏向；指出互助组是农业生产合作社的根基，必须加强领导；对农业生产合作社则仍要坚持“只许办好，不许办坏”的原则。
    会议根据一九五二年丰产经验，着重研究了推广先进经验与科学技术的问题，并总结了小麦、棉花、谷子等五大作物的丰产经验，树立了五大作物的丰产旗帜，要求各地因地制宜地将这些经验加以交流推广。会议并提出一切技术人员必须深入群众，联系群众，总结群众经验，给以科学的说明，利用各种方式广泛开展技术教育。
    会议结束时，华北行政委员会主席刘澜涛作了重要指示。他在详细阐述了一九五三年的抗美援朝、经济建设、民主建设任务及其相互关系之后，着重说明了工农业生产的关系。他说：在国家建设中，工业是决定的、领导的因素，农业则是必需的。国家建设以工业为重心，但工业生产和农业生产必须在国家统一计划下互相配合互相支援。工业愈发展，就愈需要农业的发展；农业要有新发展，也就更需要工业的领导与支援。不承认工业的决定作用和领导作用是不对的，但因此而忽视农业生产也是不对的。以工业为重心，这是就国家总的建设方针来说，这个方针要贯彻到各个方面，但不能不看具体情况机械搬用，如中共县级党委和县人民政府就应当是该地农业生产的组织者和领导者，他们的主要任务就是领导农业生产，加强了农业生产，也正是加强国家工业化的工作。刘澜涛着重指出：今年农业生产的主要要求，仍是增产粮食、工业原料和外销物资，同时须积极注意林业、牧业的发展；至于目前在全区统一提出“农林牧全面发展”的口号则是过早的，不适宜的。
    刘澜涛根据中央指示及当前华北农村情况，指出当前在农村中必须采取依靠组织起来的农民、扶助贫困农民、团结个体农民及其他劳动人民、限制富农剥削的政策。他说：在华北农村，凡是组织起来较好的地区，阶级分化就很小，如山西省武乡县组织起来达百分之九十六以上，农民生活普遍上升，农村阶级很少分化。那里的党政领导者对农民群众是尽到了责任的。但另外有些地区，由于当地的党政领导机关对农村经济的发展采取了放任自流的态度，在土地改革后不久的时间内，便又有相当数量的农民出卖了他们的土地，逐渐陷于贫困的境地。扶助贫苦农民是我们应尽的责任，我们不能对贫苦农民的困难漠不关心，必须想尽一切办法使他们努力生产，改善生活。刘澜涛指出：由分散的个体农民经过互助组、农业生产合作社再到集体农庄，这是一个长期而艰苦的过程，有其自身的规律，在指导上不能犯主观主义。在一般情况下，不要企图由个体经营一下跳到农业生产合作社，不管新区老区，农民的觉悟是逐步提高的，一切决定于我们的工作和领导。对组织起来采取冷淡消极态度是不对的，同时贪多冒进也是不对的，应按照农村经济发展法则逐步前进，不能有任何强制。刘澜涛强调必须加强对农民的政治思想教育，他说：对农民进行农村经济发展方向和爱国主义、集体主义的教育，树立爱国光荣、劳动光荣的观念，应成为农村工作者长期教育农民的任务；同时，必须向农民群众进行关于国家利益和个人利益一致、国家工业化利益和农民利益一致的教育，使农民群众能按国家计划进行农业建设，使他们了解国家工业化的利益，就是最大多数人民的最大利益。并教育农民目前主要应是依靠自己的集体力量举办各项生产事业，不要在农民中宣传不实际的口号。
    最后，刘澜涛又强调指出了对劳动模范的培养教育问题。他说：全区约有六万名左右的劳动模范，这是农业生产战线上的一支强大的突击队，他们有功劳，但由于某些领导机关的官僚主义，对劳动模范只有表扬而缺乏应有的批评教育，致有些劳动模范骄傲自大、脱离群众，今年各地必须加强对劳动模范的思想政治教育，有鼓励，也必须有批评，帮助他们不断进步，使之发挥更大的作用。
