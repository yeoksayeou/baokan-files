Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: On the morning of the 19th, the national flag was raised in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. The flag slowly ascended to the top of the silver flagpole and then slowly lowered. At the same time, from the Heilongjiang border to the southern coast, from coastal cities to the vast grasslands of Xinjiang, flags were flown at half-mast throughout the country. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people today mourn with heavy hearts the outstanding leader of the world workers' movement and a dear friend of the Chinese people, the President of the Czechoslovak Republic and Chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Comrade Gottwald.

Workers, students, and other working people in Beijing today mourn Comrade Gottwald with various ceremonies. All the delegates attending the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Workers' Representative Congress observed three minutes of silence before Comrade Gottwald's portrait. All the delegates unanimously expressed their determination to commemorate Comrade Gottwald with practical actions. The Hua Baoshan group of Beijing model workers pledged to complete their production tasks one hundred percent. Liu Dezhen, a national model worker from the Capital Power Plant, submitted a letter of determination to the Chinese Communist Party branch, guaranteeing to diligently study advanced Soviet experiences, study the historical biographies of Comrade Stalin and Comrade Gottwald, and learn from their spirit of serving the working people, overcome all difficulties in their work, and strive to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule. Peking University held a grand memorial meeting. At the meeting, President Ma Yinchu called on all teachers and students to transform grief into strength, further strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Czech peoples, and strengthen solidarity with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. Ye Anduo, a student from the Czechoslovak Republic studying at Peking University, also spoke at the meeting, saying: We firmly believe that the friendship between us and the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries will be further strengthened, and we will surely be able to victoriously reach socialist and communist society. Jin Zhaoying, a Beijing model worker and female mechanical worker, wrote to the workers of the Czechoslovak Republic with a heavy and firm heart, saying: The death of Comrade Gottwald is not only your misfortune but also our misfortune. We deeply feel that in these sorrowful days, we can only further strengthen the friendship between our two peoples and advance together under the banner of Lenin and Stalin!
