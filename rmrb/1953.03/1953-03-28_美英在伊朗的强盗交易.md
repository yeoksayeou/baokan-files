    US-UK Robbery Deal in Iran
    Shi Chi
    Since March 1951, the Iranian people's struggle against the Anglo-American imperialist plunder and for the nationalization of oil has been persistent and developing. The tide of the Iranian national liberation movement has shaken Egypt and even the entire Middle East and North Africa, hitting the imperialists' colonial rule and their plans to establish a Middle East aggressive bloc. In order to reverse this crisis, after coercing the Naguib group in Egypt to accept the "Anglo-Egyptian Sudan Agreement," the US and British imperialists recently reached a "deal" in the Dulles-Eden Washington talks on the Iranian oil issue, with the United States expressing support for the British proposal to Iran of February 20 this year.
    Although the content of this proposal has not been officially announced, it can be seen from the "agreement" in the Dulles-Eden communique on the Iranian oil issue. According to a London dispatch from the British Information Office on the 7th, the United States and the United Kingdom agreed that "Iran should continue to control its own oil industry and oil policy" and "sell its oil on the world market at competitive prices." They are trying to deceive the Iranian people with this bit of sweetness. But peel off this sugar coating, and inside is poison. The US and UK propose that Iran must "deal with the compensation issue." According to Britain's past interpretation, this means "compensating" for the "losses" of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company after it was nationalized. As Mossadegh said in a statement on March 20, this is compensation for Britain "losing the opportunity to make money." Where will Iran get the compensation from? The Dulles-Eden communique says: Iran will be able to obtain sufficient loans from the United States, which will be repaid with oil in the future. Meanwhile, a Washington dispatch from United Press International on the 7th revealed: "The United States will advance more than 100 million dollars as compensation for Iranian oil." It is clear that by using these loans "repaid with oil," the United States will in fact become the monopolist of the Iranian oil market and even control Iran's oil fields and refineries. Therefore, the so-called "guarantee" that "Iran will continue to control its own oil industry and oil policy" and "sell its oil on the world market at competitive prices" is all deceitful nonsense. US imperialism will also, through the "Point Four Program" implementing agencies and military advisory groups in Iran, turn Iran into a nominally "independent" American colony.
    For half a century, the British robbers have plundered five or six billion US dollars worth of oil from Iran, and in the end, they still want to extort a sum of "compensation." Another robber – US imperialism – "advances" this bloody money and attempts to seize Iranian oil. This is the Anglo-American imperialists' robbery deal to sell colonies, and it is the essence of the Anglo-American proposals and "agreements" on the Iranian oil issue.
    Before the Second World War, the United States was already Britain's strong rival in the Middle East for oil. After the war, the clutches of American oil monopoly capital extended into Iran, seizing 20 percent of the shares and 40 percent of the products from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Since the Iranian people launched the struggle for oil nationalization, US imperialism, masquerading as a "peacemaker" and taking the opportunity to plunder, has been two-faced, attacking from both sides, on the one hand intimidating and deceiving the Iranian people, and on the other hand, trying its best to squeeze out Britain's position in Iran. Two years have passed, negotiations have failed time and again, proposals have gone bankrupt one after another, the Iranian government has announced a severance of relations with Britain, and the wave of Iranian people opposing Anglo-American imperialism is rising higher and higher. At the same time, the contradictions between the US and Britain in Iran have become so acute that unless the two sides publicly duel, one side must admit defeat and concede. Now the British fighter sees that it is difficult to gain a foothold in Iran anymore and helplessly takes the latter course, once again bowing to its American opponent and sacrificing Iran. This is the background of the Dulles-Eden robbery deal in Washington.
    It would be unbelievable to think that Britain will from now on be docile and willing to let the United States monopolize the oil of Iran and the Middle East, and will no longer look for opportunities to retaliate and recover its losses. However, this US-British robbery deal still has the purpose of temporarily and partially easing the tense relations between the two sides in Iran and the Middle East in order to "jointly" suppress the national liberation struggles of the Iranian and Middle Eastern peoples, and thereby remove obstacles to the establishment of a Middle East aggressive bloc.
    However, the calculations of the US and British imperialists have failed once again. Under the pressure of the Iranian people's strength, Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh has rejected the Anglo-American proposal. This is clearly a blow to the US-British robbery and division plan.
    Under the leadership of the Iranian People's Party and the "National Anti-Imperialist Struggle Association of Iran," the Iranian people, regardless of the imperialist threats and the suppression of the ruling groups, have been steadfastly struggling. The Iranian people have recognized that their deadly enemies are not only the British robbers, but also the American robbers. They roar: "Throw British imperialism into the sea!" "Yankees go home!" They demand not only the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, but also the nationalization of the Bahrain Islands American Oil Company. On February 21 this year ("Day of Struggle Against the Colonial System"), workers and students in Tehran held a large demonstration demanding the expulsion of US military advisers and other advisers, and the dissolution of the "Point Four Program" implementing agencies in Iran. On the evening of February 28, the masses in Tehran held another large demonstration against US imperialism. The Iranian people are unyielding, and the US and British imperialists want to use them as victims of robbery deals, which will undoubtedly be severely hit.

    美英在伊朗的强盗交易
    施迟
    自一九五一年三月以来，伊朗人民反对英美帝国主义掠夺和要求石油国有化的斗争，一直在坚持和发展中。伊朗民族解放运动的浪潮，震荡了埃及以至整个中东和北非地区，打击了帝国主义者的殖民统治和建立中东侵略集团的计划。美英帝国主义为了扭转这种危机，在胁迫埃及纳吉布集团接受 “英埃苏丹协定”之后，又在最近的杜勒斯和艾登的华盛顿会谈中，对于伊朗石油问题作出一个强盗分赃的“协议”，美国表示支持英国今年二月二十日向伊朗提出的建议。
    这个建议的内容虽没有正式公布，但从杜艾会谈的公报关于伊朗石油问题的“协议”中可以看出。据英国新闻处伦敦七日电，美英两国同意“伊朗继续控制它自己的石油工业和石油政策”；并且“以竞争价格在世界市场上出售它的石油”。他们企图用这点甜头来欺骗伊朗人民。但剥去这层糖衣，里面就是毒药。美英提出伊朗必须“处理赔偿问题”，按照英国过去的解释，就是“赔偿”英伊石油公司被收归国有的“损失”，正如摩萨台在三月二十日的声明中所说，这是对英国“失去赚钱机会”的赔偿。伊朗的赔款从那里来呢？杜艾会谈的公报说：伊朗将可以得到美国充足的贷款，这些贷款将来以石油偿还。同时，合众社华盛顿七日电透露：“美国将垫出一亿以上的款项，作为伊朗石油赔款”。事情很明白，这样一来，美国利用这些“以石油偿还”的贷款，实际上将成为伊朗石油市场的垄断者，甚至控制伊朗的油田和炼油厂。因而所谓“伊朗继续控制它自己的石油工业和石油政策”、“以竞争价格在世界市场上出售它的石油”的“保证”，都是骗人的鬼话。美帝国主义并将通过“第四点计划”在伊朗的执行机构和军事顾问团，把伊朗变成形式上“独立”的美国殖民地。
    半世纪来，英国强盗从伊朗劫掠了五、六十亿美元的石油，末了还要勒索一笔“赔款”；另一个强盗——美帝国主义就“垫出”这笔血腥钱，而企图把伊朗石油抢夺过来。这就是美英帝国主义买卖殖民地的强盗交易，也就是英美对伊朗石油问题的建议和“协议”的实质。
    在第二次世界大战前，美国已是英国在中东争夺石油的劲敌，战后，美国石油垄断资本的魔手又伸入伊朗，从英伊石油公司夺取了百分之二十的股份和百分之四十的产品。自伊朗人民展开石油国有化斗争以来，装扮“和事佬”实则乘机掠夺的美帝国主义，更是两面三刀，左右开弓，一方面对伊朗人民进行恫吓欺骗，一方面竭力排挤英国在伊朗的地位。两年的时间过去了，谈判一次次失败，建议一个个破产，伊朗政府宣布对英绝交，伊朗人民反对英美帝国主义的浪潮愈来愈高涨。同时，美英在伊朗的矛盾已经尖锐到这样程度：除非双方公开决斗，就得有一方认输让步。现在英国斗士看到在伊朗已经难再立足了，无可奈何地采取后一着，又一次向它的美国对手低头，把伊朗作为牺牲品。这就是杜勒斯和艾登在华盛顿的强盗交易的背景。
    假如认为英国从此俯首贴耳，甘心让美国独占伊朗和中东的石油，而再不想找机会报复翻本，那是不可相信的事。不过，这次美英强盗交易仍然有着这样的目的：暂时地局部地缓和双方在伊朗和中东的紧张关系，以便“合力”镇压伊朗和中东人民民族解放斗争，并从而排除建立中东侵略集团的障碍。
    然而，美英帝国主义的盘算又一次失败了。在伊朗人民力量的压力下，伊朗首相摩萨台已经拒绝了英美建议。这显然是对美英强盗分赃计划的一个打击。
    伊朗人民在伊朗人民党和“伊朗全国反帝国主义斗争协会”的领导下，不顾帝国主义的恫吓，不顾统治集团的镇压，始终坚强地进行斗争。伊朗人民已经认清，他们的死敌不仅是英国强盗，美国强盗也是一路货。他们怒吼：“把英帝国主义扔下海去！”“美国佬滚回去！”他们不仅要求把英伊石油公司收归国有，同时也要求将巴林群岛美国石油公司收归国有。今年二月二十一日（“反对殖民制度斗争日”），德黑兰工人和学生举行了大示威，要求把美国军事顾问和其他顾问赶出去，并解散“第四点计划”在伊朗的执行机构。同月二十八日晚间，德黑兰群众又举行了反对美帝国主义的大示威。伊朗人民是不可屈服的，美英帝国主义要把他们当作强盗交易的牺牲品，无疑是要受到严重打击的。
