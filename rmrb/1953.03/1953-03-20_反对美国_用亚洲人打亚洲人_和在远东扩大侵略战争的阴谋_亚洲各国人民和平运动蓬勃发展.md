Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: Inspired by the great achievements of the World People's Peace Congress, the peace movement of the people of Asian countries has been further developed. The Congress's resolutions proposing to stop the current wars and safeguard national independence and international security have mobilized more people in this region to participate in the struggle to defend peace and oppose war. The focus of this struggle is to oppose the Eisenhower administration's conspiracy to use "Asians to fight Asians" and to expand the war of aggression in Korea and the Far East.

Eisenhower's announcement of his intention to use the Kuomintang bandits to harass the Chinese mainland and other calls for expanding the war have aroused widespread anger and protests from the people of India, Burma, Japan, and other countries. At the call of the All-India Peace Council, the Indian people held "Stop Eisenhower's Actions Day" on February 27th. In large cities such as Calcutta and Delhi, industrial centers such as Jamshedpur, and many cities and villages from Assam and Tripura in the far east of India to Punjab province in northwestern India, mass rallies and demonstrations were widely held. The mass rally in Calcutta passed a resolution demanding that the Indian government immediately inform the United States that the Indian people unanimously opposed the US war policy. People in various parts of West Bengal also held gatherings and parades, with slogans such as: "Immediate ceasefire in Korea," "No interference in China," and "Down with the imperialist policy of creating war." At the same time, many prominent figures, including members of Congress, issued statements demanding an immediate end to the Korean War. Following this, on March 2nd, 5,000 citizens of Calcutta held a demonstration, holding torches and shouting the slogan "American imperialists get out of Asia," protesting the entry of four US warships participating in the Korean War into the port of Calcutta and demanding that these warships leave Indian waters immediately. This strong voice of the Indian people in defending peace and opposing war has also been reflected in Indian public opinion. The Indian "Crossroads Weekly" denounced Eisenhower's policy of attempting to use the remnants of the Kuomintang in Taiwan to harass the Chinese mainland, saying: "The war-mongers are determined to expand the Korean War, which is a challenge to the Asian people... The Indian people must answer this challenge." Even the conservative "Indian Times" criticized Eisenhower's decision as "midwinter madness" and a "desperate decision."

The people of Burma, Ceylon, and other countries have also protested against the US war conspiracy and demanded an immediate ceasefire in Korea through peaceful gatherings and the issuance of statements.

In Japan, which is directly controlled by the United States, people from all walks of life have also expressed their anger and opposition to the US's aggressive conspiracy in the Far East in various ways. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, with three million members, denounced Eisenhower's policy of attempting to use Kuomintang bandits to harass the Chinese mainland and called on the people of the country to launch a movement demanding an immediate end to the Korean War. The Japan Peace Protection Committee has decided to convene a "People's Congress for Peace" in late March to discuss issues such as stopping the Korean War and the five major powers concluding a peace treaty. In preparation for the convening of the conference, broadly representative gatherings are being held in various prefectures and regions of Japan. At the same time, the Japanese people are combining the struggle against rearmament and overthrowing the Yoshida traitorous government with the struggle against US expansion of aggression in the Far East and using "Asians to fight Asians." The recent large-scale demonstration of more than 30,000 Japanese workers in Tokyo against rearmament, the Yoshida government, and its restrictive strike bill showed the Japanese people's strong will not to fight with the people of other Asian countries. A Reuters report acknowledged that among the Japanese people, "opposition to rearmament is still in the majority: young people are very unwilling to serve in the army, and women voters - who are in the majority - are against conscription. Many ordinary voters are also afraid of anything that might revive extreme wartime militarism." The "Hindustan Standard" commented on the recent failure of the Yoshida government, saying: "Yoshida's failure and the dissolution of the Diet reflect a strong trend against the US's policies and actions in the Far East," and pointed out that this shows that "the US policy of using Asians to fight Asians can no longer appeal to the Japanese people."

The vigorous development of the Asian people's movement for peace and against war has caused great fear among the US and British ruling groups and their mouthpieces. The US "Washington Post" reporter Kuhn said uneasily in a dispatch about the situation in Japan: "Unless the United States recognizes the deep-rooted Japanese aversion to rearmament, it will make painful mistakes in the coming years." Even the new US Secretary of State Dulles had to admit in a speech on January 15th that "In the Middle East, anti-American sentiment has become a threat. As long as the Indochina War and the Korean War continue, the situation in the Far East is the same as in the Middle East." However, he dared not clearly state the reason for this "anti-American sentiment" among the Asian people. The British "Manchester Guardian" was more honest, saying: "Any major attempt to use Asians to fight Asians throughout Southeast Asia will have unfortunate and serious consequences," because "Asians do not want to fight Asians, they believe that is fighting for American interests."

### 反对美国“用亚洲人打亚洲人”和在远东扩大侵略战争的阴谋  亚洲各国人民和平运动蓬勃发展

    反对美国“用亚洲人打亚洲人”和在远东扩大侵略战争的阴谋
    亚洲各国人民和平运动蓬勃发展
    【新华社十七日讯】在世界人民和平大会的伟大成就的鼓舞下，亚洲各国人民的和平运动已得到进一步的发展。大会决议所提出的停止现行战争，维护民族独立和国际安全的主张，把这一区域的更多的人民动员起来参加到保卫和平、反对战争的斗争中。这个斗争的中心就是：反对美国艾森豪威尔政府利用“亚洲人打亚洲人”、在朝鲜和远东扩大侵略战争的阴谋。
    艾森豪威尔宣布的企图利用国民党匪帮窜扰中国大陆的决定和其它关于扩大战争的叫嚣，引起了印度、缅甸、日本等国人民普遍的愤怒和抗议。在全印和平理事会的号召下，印度人民在二月二十七日举行了“制止艾森豪威尔行动日”。在加尔各答、德里等大城市和工业中心亚姆雪普尔等地，从印度的极东部的阿萨姆和特里波拉到印度西北部旁遮普省，许多城市和乡村都广泛举行了群众大会和示威游行。加尔各答的群众大会，通过决议要求印度政府立即告诉美国，印度人民一致反对美国的战争政策。西孟加拉各地人民也纷纷举行集会和游行，他们的口号是：“立刻在朝鲜停火”、“不许干涉中国”和“打倒帝国主义的制造战争的政策”。与此同时，包括国会议员在内的许多位著名人士发表了声明，要求立刻结束朝鲜战争。紧接着在三月二日，加尔各答的五千市民又举行示威游行，他们举着火炬高呼“美帝国主义者滚出亚洲去”的口号，抗议参加侵朝战争的四艘美国军舰开进加尔各答港，要求这些军舰立刻离开印度海面。印度人民这种保卫和平、反对战争的强烈呼声，也在印度的舆论中间得到了反映。印度“十字路周报”斥责艾森豪威尔企图利用台湾国民党残匪窜扰中国大陆的政策说：“战争贩子一心想扩大朝鲜战争，这是对亚洲人民的挑战……印度人民必须答复这个挑战”。甚至保守的“印度时报”也斥责艾森豪威尔这一决定是“深冬的疯狂”，“绝望的决定”。
    缅甸、锡兰等国的人民也以和平集会和发表声明的方式，抗议美国的战争阴谋，要求在朝鲜立即停战。
    在美国直接控制下的日本，各阶层人民也以各种方式表示他们对美国在远东扩大侵略阴谋的愤怒和反对。拥有三百万会员的日本工会总评议会斥责艾森豪威尔企图利用国民党匪帮窜扰中国大陆的政策，并号召全国人民展开要求立即停止朝鲜战争的运动。日本拥护和平委员会已决定在三月下旬召开
    “人民争取和平大会”，讨论停止朝鲜战争、五大国缔结和平公约等问题。为了迎接大会的召开，在日本的各县和各地区，正在举行有广泛代表性的集会。同时，日本人民正在把“反对重新武装、打倒吉田卖国政府”的斗争和反对美国在远东扩大侵略、利用“亚洲人打亚洲人”的斗争结合起来。最近三万多名日本工人在东京举行的反对重新武装、反对吉田政府及其限制罢工法案的大规模示威运动，表示出日本人民坚决不和亚洲其他国家人民作战的强烈意志。路透社的一条消息承认，在日本人民当中，“反对重整军备的还是多数：青年都是很不愿当兵的，妇女选举人——她们是占多数的——是反对征兵的。许多普通选举人对于可能使极端的战时军国主义复活的任何东西也都害怕”。“印度斯坦旗报”评论最近吉田政府的失败说：“吉田的失败和国会的解散，反映了强烈的反对美国对远东的政策和行动的趋势，”并且指出，这表明“美国利用亚洲人打亚洲人的政策已不能使日本人民群众向往”。
    亚洲人民要求和平、反对战争运动的蓬勃发展，引起了美英统治集团及其御用报章的很大恐惧。美国的“华盛顿邮报”记者库恩在关于日本情况的一篇通讯里不安地说：“除非美国认识到日本人根深蒂固地厌恶重新武装，不然在今后的几年中会犯惨痛的错误。”甚至美国新任国务卿杜勒斯也不得不在一月十五日的演说中承认：“在中东方面，仇美情绪已经构成一种威胁。只要印度支那战争和朝鲜战争继续进行，远东的情况也和中东一样。”但是，他不敢明白说出亚洲人民这种“仇美情绪”的原因何在。倒是英国的“曼彻斯特卫报”比较老实一些，它说：“在整个东南亚以亚洲人打亚洲人的任何重大企图都会遭到不幸的严重后果”，因为“亚洲人不想打亚洲人，他们认为那就是为美国的利益打仗。”
