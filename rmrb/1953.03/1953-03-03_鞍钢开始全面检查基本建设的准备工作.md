Anshan Iron and Steel Begins Comprehensive Inspection of Basic Construction Preparations

[This newspaper's dispatch] Anshan Iron and Steel Company's basic construction department has begun a comprehensive inspection of preparations for basic construction. In late February, Anshan Iron and Steel Company transferred more than 120 cadres from various basic construction departments (including section chiefs and section heads), and merged them with the 25-member inspection team from the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry that came to Anshan, forming six construction preparation work inspection teams for planning, engineering, equipment, materials, finance, and on-site welfare (a separate inspection team for design). On February 28, the inspection teams began to inspect the preparation work for basic construction at various construction sites and engineering companies.

The six inspection teams will focus on inspecting various construction projects. In addition to the inspection content stipulated by the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, the engineering team will also inspect the technical management strength and labor force allocation, as well as the preparation of construction machinery and equipment, construction plans, and construction organization design. The equipment team will focus on inspecting the ordering status of equipment from abroad and domestically for the construction site and the accuracy of equipment data. The finance team is responsible for inspecting and studying the financial problems existing in this year's engineering work.

On the afternoon of February 27, the basic construction department convened a meeting of various inspection teams. Responsible comrades from Anshan Iron and Steel Company called on everyone to be realistic, conscientious, and responsible in doing a good job in the inspection. If problems are found, they should be resolved in a timely manner. Particularly significant problems should be immediately reported to higher authorities for rapid resolution to ensure timely and comprehensive preparation for basic construction.
