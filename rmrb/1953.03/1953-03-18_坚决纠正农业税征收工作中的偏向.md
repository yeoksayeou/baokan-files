    Resolutely Correct Deviations in Agricultural Tax Collection Work

    The agricultural tax in 1952 was lighter than in 1951. Due to the cancellation of surcharges and various unreasonable apportionments, the total amount of grain burden on farmers nationwide was reduced by 2.5 billion jin of refined grain compared to 1951. However, it should be pointed out that although the total burden on farmers nationwide has been reduced, the burden on farmers in various regions has increased or decreased. Due to the poor performance of land survey and production determination, and legal reduction and exemption work in some areas, especially due to the very serious bureaucratism of some leading organs, the coercive orders and illegal and disciplinary actions of some grassroots cadres, the burden on farmers has become abnormally light or heavy, causing some losses that could have been avoided. For example, the total amount of agricultural tax collected in Jiangsu Province in 1952 was reduced by 400 million jin of refined grain compared to 1951, but several farmer suicides occurred in the province. Other provinces such as Hubei, Zhejiang, Anhui, Sichuan, and Jiangxi also experienced farmer suicides. These suicides were mostly among poor farmers lacking labor, with the elderly, widowed, orphaned, weak, and disabled accounting for more than half; some were chronically ill, heavily indebted, and suffered abuse at home or were lazy; in addition, some were farmers who had consistently been excluded by bad cadres. Although such incidents are very isolated from a national perspective, their nature is extremely serious and must be resolutely corrected.

    The total grain burden on farmers nationwide in 1952 was lighter than in 1951; agricultural production also increased, so why did the above-mentioned accidents still occur? The reasons are fivefold:

    (1) Deviations of being too high or too low occurred in the land survey and production determination work. In areas where it was too high, problems arose because the tax amount exceeded the farmers' ability to bear it. In some areas, due to inaccurate land area and low yields in the past, the burden was relatively light; after verifying the land area and yield, the farmers' burden suddenly increased, with the burden on individual households increasing by 50% or even more than 100% compared to the previous year. Because the leadership did not foresee the impact of this sudden increase and did not provide sufficient care in advance, problems arose.

    (2) The work of legal reduction and exemption was not done well. When collecting agricultural taxes, some areas failed to reduce when they should have, and some reduced when they should not have. This caused problems. In 1952, more attention was paid to reduction and exemption work in large disaster areas; however, insufficient attention was paid to individual households without labor or difficult households suffering from chronic illness or unexpected disasters in non-disaster areas, and they were not granted timely reductions and exemptions. Some areas subjectively allocated reduction and exemption tasks without in-depth investigation beforehand, implementing a "reduction and exemption contract" method; some places reduced and exempted equally regardless of the severity of the disaster or the size of the difficulty; some places regarded reduction and exemption as a kind of "political treatment," only giving reductions and exemptions to generally difficult households, but not to households considered politically problematic (such as those under control) who were living in poverty; some village cadres only reduced for themselves and not for the masses, suppressing democracy and engaging in corruption. Some county and district cadres lacked a pragmatic attitude and even mistakenly proposed the slogan "Reduction and exemption is shameful, no reduction and exemption is glorious," and even secretly lent money to difficult households, asking them to publicly state that they "take the lead in not reducing and exempting" in order to achieve the goal of universal non-reduction. This is a completely policy-violating and atrocious behavior.

    (3) There were problems with the collection methods. In order to control grain, some agricultural tax collection departments allocated more grain collection quotas and fewer cash equivalents to areas with more industrial raw material crops and more developed sideline businesses. In addition, due to insufficient grain supply in the market at the time, the market price of grain was higher than the official price, making it difficult for farmers to deliver grain. Some places first issued tax payment notices to farmers and then issued reduction and exemption notices, causing farmers to see only the need for grain and not the reduction and exemption, which led to doubts and concerns. Some cadres regarded the distribution of tax payment notices as a purely technical task and did not vigorously publicize and explain, causing ideological fluctuations among farmers with difficulties after receiving the tax payment notices, and some even committed suicide.

    (4) In some areas, local products were slow to sell, and the work of collecting loans and grain was squeezed together, making it difficult for farmers to manage and causing difficulties that were not easy to overcome.

    (5) Some grassroots cadres had a serious commandist work style, only knew how to collect grain, did not understand policies, and individual cadres violated laws and regulations and acted recklessly. This is also an important reason for the above-mentioned incidents. For example, a cadre in Huidong County, Xikang Province, forced a farmer who had lost his public grain receipt to pay public grain again, which led to his death.

    The above five items are the specific reasons for the incidents of forcing people to death in grain collection work. The fundamental reason is that the competent authorities at all levels are politically paralyzed, blindly complacent, satisfied with the old experience, and have not regarded grain collection work as a major political task related to the worker-peasant alliance, thus relaxing leadership. They subjectively believed: "Cadres are experienced, the masses are accustomed, as long as we call for it, they will pay in full," "This year's harvest is not bad, and agricultural tax surcharges have been canceled, so there will be no problem with collection work." However, they did not seriously study the new situation in burdens caused by land survey and production determination, and only made general calls for grain collection, lacking specific guidance and in-depth inspection. The Central Ministry of Finance also bears responsibility for these situations due to insufficient prior estimation, failing to systematically summarize experiences in a timely manner, and failing to provide specific instructions to various regions. It should conduct in-depth inspections and accept these painful lessons.

    In order to quickly remedy the losses caused by grain collection work, local Party committees, people's governments, and financial departments should dispatch responsible cadres to go to the scene to thoroughly investigate and deal with the matter. The deceased should be given condolences and legal reductions and exemptions; cadres who have committed coercive command errors should be criticized and educated according to the severity of their circumstances, and necessary punishments should be given; those who violate laws and regulations must be severely punished. All localities should select typical cases, publicize the handling process, and use them to educate general cadres and restore political influence. Currently, some areas, such as Hebei Province, have already done so, which is correct. However, many areas do not pay enough attention to this or do not do it seriously, and this situation should be quickly changed.

### 坚决纠正农业税征收工作中的偏向

    坚决纠正农业税征收工作中的偏向
    一九五二年的农业税较一九五一年为轻。由于取消了附加和各种不合理的摊派，全国农民公粮负担总额比一九五一年减少二十五亿斤细粮。但是应该指出：全国农民的负担总额虽有减轻，各地区农民的负担则有增有减。由于某些地区查田定产、依法减免的工作做得不好，特别由于某些领导机关的官僚主义、若干基层干部的强迫命令和违法乱纪行为非常严重，这就使得农民的负担发生了畸轻畸重的现象，造成了一些本来可以避免的损失。例如江苏省一九五二年农业税征收总额比一九五一年减少四亿斤细粮，但该省竟发生若干农民自杀的事件。其他如湖北、浙江、安徽、四川、江西等省，也有农民自杀事件发生。这些自杀的农民，以缺乏劳动力的贫苦农民为最多，其中孤、寡、老、弱、残疾者占一半以上；有些是久病不起、负债较多，在家中受气或懒惰的人；此外，还有些是一贯被坏干部所排挤的农民。这种事件从全国来说，虽然是很个别的，但它的性质是极为严重的，必须坚决加以纠正。
    一九五二年全国农民公粮负担总额比一九五一年减轻了；农业生产又提高了，为什么还会发生上述事故呢？究其原因有五：
      （一）查田定产工作发生了偏高偏低的现象。在偏高地区，因税额超过了农民的负担能力，就发生了问题。有的地区因过去田亩不实，产量偏低，负担较轻；经核实田亩产量后，农民负担骤然增加，个别农户的负担较上年增加百分之五十甚至一倍以上。由于领导方面没有预见到这种突然增加的情况将会发生什么影响，没有事先加以充分照顾，因而发生了问题。
      （二）没有做好依法减免工作。各地在征收农业税的时候，有当减未减的，有不当减而减的。这就发生了问题。一九五二年各地对大片灾区的减免工作比较注意；但对非灾区个别无劳力户或久病不起、遭受意外灾害的困难户，则注意不够，没有及时准予减免。有的地区事先没有深入调查，竟主观地分配了减免任务，实行“减免包干”办法；有的地方不问受灾轻重，困难大小，一律平均减免；有的地方把减免当作一种“政治待遇”，只给一般有困难的户减免，对被认为政治上有问题（如被管制分子）而生活困难的户，则不给减免；有些乡村干部只给自己减，不给群众减，压制民主，徇私舞弊。还有些县、区干部缺乏实事求是的作风，竟错误地提出
    “减免可耻，不减免光荣”的口号，甚至暗中借钱给困难户，要他们当众表示“带头不减免”，以便达到普遍不减的目的。这是完全违犯政策的恶劣行为。
      （三）征收方法上有毛病。有些征收农业税的部门为了掌握粮食，对于种植工业原料作物较多的地区和副业较发达的地区，分配的粮食征收额多，分配的代金额少，加以当时市场粮食供应不足，粮食市价高于牌价，农民交粮就发生了困难。有的地方对农民先发纳税通知，后发减免通知，农民只见要粮，不见减免，发生了疑问和顾虑。有些干部把散发纳税通知看作是单纯技术工作，没有大力宣传解释，致使有困难的农民在接到纳税通知后发生思想波动，有的竟自杀了。
      （四）部分地区土产滞销，催收贷款与征粮工作，又挤在一起，使农民难于周转，发生了不易克服的困难。
      （五）若干基层干部存在着严重的强迫命令作风，只知要粮，不懂政策，个别干部违法乱纪，胡作非为。这也是造成上述事件的重要原因。例如：西康省会东县一个干部强令一个遗失公粮收据的农民重新交纳公粮，以致把他逼死了。
    以上五项都是征粮工作中发生逼死人的事件的具体原因。而根本原因则是各级主管部门政治麻痹，盲目自满，满足于老一套的经验，没有把征粮工作看作是关系工农联盟的重大的政治任务，因而放松了领导。他们主观地以为：“干部有经验，群众有习惯，只要一号召即可交齐”，“今年收成还不错，农业税附加又取消了，征收工作没问题。”但对查田定产后所引起的负担上的新情况却不加以认真研究，对征粮只作一般号召，缺乏具体的指导和深入的检查。中央财政部对这些情况事先估计不足，没有及时地系统地总结经验，对各地进行具体指示，也有责任，应该进行深入检查，接受这些惨痛的教训。
     为了迅速补救征粮工作中所造成的这种损失，各地党委、人民政府财政部门应该派遣负责干部，亲赴现场彻查处理。对于死者应该予以抚恤，并依法减免；对犯有强迫命令错误的干部，应该按其情节轻重，予以批评教育，和必要的处分；对于违法乱纪者则必须从严惩处。各地应选择典型事例，公布处理经过，借以教育一般干部，挽回政治影响。目前有一部分地区，如河北省已经这样做了，这是正确的。但不少地区则对此重视不足，没有做或做得不认真，这种情况应当迅速加以改变。
