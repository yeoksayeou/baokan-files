Telegrams of Condolence from Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and Kaifeng Municipal Federation of Trade Unions

To the Central Council of Czechoslovak Trade Unions:

We are deeply saddened to hear the unfortunate news of Comrade Gottwald's passing. Comrade Gottwald was not only the beloved leader of the Czechoslovak people but also an outstanding fighter of the international workers' movement. His death is a great loss to the Czechoslovak people and to the entire world peace and democracy camp. We express our deepest condolences to the working people of Czechoslovakia with the most profound sorrow and are determined, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, to further consolidate and develop the unity, friendship, and cooperation between the Chinese and Czechoslovak people, and to fight to the end to strengthen the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and to defend world peace.

                                      Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, China
                                Kaifeng Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, China
                              March 15, 1953
