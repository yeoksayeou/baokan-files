Editor's Note: This is a report sent by the Readers' Letters Group of Liaodong Dazhong Bao. This report reveals the erroneous behavior of Kong Xianglin, Secretary of the CPC Xiuyan County Committee, and others in openly suppressing criticism and arbitrarily retaliating against critics; it also reveals the erroneous attitude of the Liaodong Provincial Party Committee in disregarding criticism from the masses. According to the facts listed in this report, not only should Kong Xianglin's and others' erroneous behavior be publicly exposed and criticized in the newspaper to educate all Party members and cadres, but Kong Xianglin and others should also be given Party disciplinary action. The Readers' Letters Group of Liaodong Dazhong Bao acted correctly in handling the criticism according to the Party Committee's opinions while also reflecting different opinions to the higher-level Party Committee and the Party newspaper.

	In August 1952, some leading cadres in Xiuyan County purchased confiscated赃物 from corrupt elements at low prices during the Xiuyan County Thrift Inspection Committee's handling of confiscated items. County Head Teng Qi bought a pair of wool pants worth 150,000 yuan for 40,000 yuan. Wang Shuangfu, Deputy Minister of the County Party Committee's Organization Department, and Tian Chenghua, Deputy Director of the Public Security Bureau, even had a principled dispute over抢 buying a watch. County Party Committee Secretary Kong Xianglin and Teng Qi also led their families to the warehouse to select and purchase items at will. At that time, Song Jingzhen (a Communist Party member) who worked in the Thrift Inspection Committee, repeatedly raised objections to Jin Chunyang, the Deputy Director of the Thrift Inspection Committee, opposing this practice, but Jin Chunyang said: "They are all leading cadres, what can we do if they buy some cheap goods! We can just sell other things for more money!" Subsequently, Song Jingzhen reported the situation to Chen Fengru (County Party Committee Propaganda Officer) and Yin Hongru (Clerk in the County Party Committee's General Office), correspondents for Liaodong Dazhong Bao. Chen and Yin wrote articles and sent them to Dongbei Ribao, Liaodong Dazhong Bao, and the Provincial Party Committee, hoping that the newspapers would publicly expose and handle the matter.

	After receiving the criticism稿 from Chen Fengru and others, the Liaodong Provincial Party Committee forwarded it to the Xiuyan County Party Committee for handling. After seeing this criticism, Kong Xianglin was furious and questioned Yin Hongru, saying: "Is the situation you reflected real? It's all hearsay. Why didn't you raise this matter in the Party group meeting, why did you write to the higher authorities? Can you be responsible if you're wrong?" He also said: "This issue should not be reported to the newspaper, isn't this confusing internal and external matters? Should the Provincial Party Committee believe me or believe them?" Then he threatened: "If the Provincial Party Committee punishes us, our County Party Committee will also make a decision to punish you." Hu Guojun, the Propaganda Minister, slammed the table and said: "Little Yin, Chen Fengru! Criticism must be correct, otherwise it will make people at a loss!" Lai Enhui, the former Deputy Director of the County Party Committee's General Office, and Hou Junshan, the current Deputy Director of the General Office, also said: Why didn't such a large criticism report go through the County Party Committee? This is terrible! Correspondence officer Sha Kai should also be responsible!

	Liaodong Dazhong Bao also wrote a short commentary to accompany the publication of Chen Fengru and Yin Hongru's criticism. However, when this news was sent to the Liaodong Provincial Party Committee for review, Secretary Wang of the Provincial Party Committee gave the following instructions to Zhang Xinchao, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department and Editor-in-Chief of the newspaper: "It is recommended that this稿 not be published, but be sent to the Provincial Party Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission for internal notification and resolution." After receiving this instruction, the editorial department of Liaodong Dazhong Bao replied to correspondent Chen Fengru: "The Provincial Party Committee's intention is that it is an internal matter and will not be published publicly, but will be resolved internally." After this news spread to the Xiuyan County Party Committee, Kong Xianglin and others intensified their retaliatory actions against critics such as Chen Fengru. They successively convened three expanded branch committee meetings and expanded county committee meetings, using the names of "democratic make-up lessons," "unifying understanding," and "resolving contradictions" to openly retaliate against Chen Fengru and others, and to force them to confess the motives for their criticism, attempting to punish them. Later, because Wang Qun, the secretary of the County Party Committee's organ branch, repeatedly objected, Kong Xianglin and others changed their approach and first transferred Chen Fengru away. Wang Qun was also retaliated against for supporting the criticism. At that time, Wang Qun complained angrily: "It's outrageous, the County Party Committee Secretary still treats criticism like this, we really can't work." Kong Xianglin seized this sentence and publicly attacked him at the county-level directly affiliated organs cadre meeting, saying: "Some people are creating small cliques, opposing the leadership under the guise of criticism, and don't want to work. If you don't want to work, get out!" Then they transferred Song Jingzhen, who had made suggestions to them, to the district, and instructed the district's leading cadres to say:

	"In ideological construction, Song Jingzhen must be questioned why he didn't raise his opinions of the leadership face-to-face, what is his thinking?...", and said: "There is a problem with Song Jingzhen, his character is bad." Gao Shuying, the director of the County Women's Federation, and Dong Lianyong, the secretary of the County Discipline Inspection Commission, were also retaliated against for supporting Chen Fengru's criticism, and were transferred away under false pretenses. Kong Xianglin and Lai Enhui also asked the authors to write self-criticisms and asked the correspondence officer to write a letter to the newspaper stating a correction. As a result, the cadres below discussed: It's okay to criticize district and village cadres, but you have to think carefully before criticizing county leaders! Branch Secretary Wang Qun said: "Don't talk to the province anymore, it won't solve the problem, and if they send the original document to the County Party Committee, it will be even worse!" Yin Hongru said: "This time we have become orphans because of criticism!"

	Kong Xianglin's behavior of suppressing democracy and suppressing criticism is consistent, and he has always held the idea that "family scandals should not be publicized." Last year, District Party Committee Secretary Yang Diange wrote a letter to Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, and Dongbei Ribao, criticizing Xiuyan County's government for not timely injecting vaccines when carrying out epidemic prevention work for livestock, which delayed spring plowing. When Chairman Gao Gang sent someone to investigate, Kong Xianglin questioned Yang Diange: "Why didn't you report to the County Party Committee, but wrote to the higher authorities?" Last August, when Zhang Xuefeng from the newspaper went to Xiuyan to investigate the grain issue, Kong Xianglin said to Propaganda Minister Hu Guojun: "We have to be careful when we speak! Reporters are like that, they'll stick to you if you give them an opening…" When Kong Xianglin reports work to higher levels, he always reports good news and not bad news, full of achievements, concealing shortcomings.

	In addition, Kong Xianglin also protects cadres with errors. For example, condoning Man Shiyi, the former head of Xiuyan County and President of the Court, for violating the Marriage Law by beating his wife and forcing her to divorce. Gao Shuying, the director of the County Women's Federation, proposed a handling opinion to Kong Xianglin. But Kong Xianglin not only did not handle it correctly, but also attacked Gao Shuying. Hu Guojun, the Minister of Propaganda of the County Party Committee, has a bad work style and is passive in his work, which has a very bad impact on the cadres. Some people have raised some criticisms of Hu Guojun, but Kong falsely accused the critics of "attacking the leadership." After the "Three-Anti" movement, Hu Guojun was promoted to a member of the County Party Committee. In short, Kong Xianglin's behavior of resisting criticism and retaliating against critics has reached an intolerable level and should be seriously dealt with.

    中共岫岩县委书记孔祥林等蛮横压制批评
    辽东大众报读者来信组
    编者按：这是辽东大众报读者来信组寄来的一份报告。这个报告揭露了中共岫岩县县委书记孔祥林等人公开压制批评、对批评者进行蛮横打击报复的错误行为；同时还揭露了辽东省委轻视来自群众的批评的错误态度。按照这一报告所列举的事实来看，对孔祥林等的错误行为，不但应该在报纸上进行公开的揭露和批判，以教育全体党员和全体干部；而且对孔祥林等人应该给以党纪处分。辽东大众报读者来信组在进行批评时一面依照党委意见处理，一面把不同意见向上级党委和党报反映，这种作法，是完全正确的。
    一九五二年八月，岫岩县部分领导干部在本县节约检查委员会处理贪污分子的脏物时，纷纷以贱价购买脏物，县长滕奇就用四万元买去了价值十五万元的一条毛裤，县委组织部副部长王双福和公安局副局长田承华，还因为抢买一只表而引起了无原则的纠纷。该县县委书记孔祥林和滕奇等还领着他们的家属随便到仓库选购。当时在节约检查委员会工作的宋景珍（共产党员），曾一再向节约检查委员会副主任金春阳提出意见，反对这种作法，但金春阳却说：“都是领导干部，买点便宜货，有什么办法！在其他东西上多卖点钱就有啦！”随后，宋景珍就向辽东大众报通讯员陈凤儒（县委宣传干事）、殷洪儒（县委秘书处收发员）反映了这一情况，陈、殷二人当时就写稿寄给东北日报、辽东大众报和省委，希望报社公开揭发和处理。
    辽东省委接到陈凤儒等的批评稿以后，就把它转交岫岩县委处理。孔祥林看到这一批评以后，立即大发雷霆，质问殷洪儒说：“你反映的情况实在吗？尽是道听途说。这个事在党的小组会为什么不提出来，为什么偏往上面写？错了你敢负责吗？”又说：“这个问题也不应该向报社反映，这不是内外不分吗？报社不是党的组织，省委该相信我还是相信我。”接着又威胁说：“如果省委给我们处分，我们县委也同样给你们做出处分决定。”宣传部长胡国钧拍着桌子说：“小殷、陈凤儒！批评必须正确，要不正确就使人无所措手足！”原任县委秘书处副主任赖恩惠，和现任秘书处副主任侯俊山也都表示：写这样大的批评稿为什么不通过县委会呢？真不得了！通讯干事沙铠也应该负责啊！
    辽东大众报在发表陈凤儒和殷洪儒的批评稿时，还配合写了短评。但是，当把这一消息送交辽东省委审查时，省委王秘书长给宣传部副部长兼报社社长张欣潮作了如下的指示：“建议此稿不登，可送省委纪律检查委员会，从党内通报解决之。”辽东大众报编辑部接到这一指示以后，就答复通讯员陈凤儒说：“省委意图是内部问题，不公开发表，要在内部解决。”这一消息传到岫岩县委以后，孔祥林等就变本加厉地对批评者陈凤儒等采取了一系列的报复行为。他们前后曾召开三次支委扩大会和县委扩大会，以“民主补课”“统一认识”“解决矛盾”为名，公开向陈凤儒等报复，并追逼他们坦白批评的动机，企图给以处分。后因县委机关支部书记王群一再反对，孔祥林等才改变方式，先把陈凤儒调走。王群因为支持批评，也受到了报复。当时，王群曾怨恨地说：“真不像话，县委书记还这样对待批评，我们真没法干。”孔祥林抓住这句话就在全县直属机关干部大会上公开对他进行打击，说：“有些人闹小集团，以批评为名反对领导，又想不干工作，不干就给我滚蛋！”接着把曾经向他们提过意见的宋景珍调到区里，并指示区的领导干部说：
    “在思想建设中，对宋景珍要追问，为什么对领导有意见不当面提，是什么思想？……”，并说：“宋景珍有问题，品质恶劣”。县妇联主任高淑英和县纪律检查委员会秘书董连勇，也因支持陈凤儒等的批评而受到了报复，都被借故调走。孔祥林和赖恩惠并让写稿人写检讨，要通讯干事写信给报社声明更正。这样，下面干部纷纷议论：批评区村干部还行，批评县的领导干部可得寻思点！支部书记王群说：“别再向省里讲啦，讲也不解决问题，当不了把原件寄给县委，那更不好办啦！”殷洪儒说：“咱们这回因为批评，成了没有娘的孩子啦！”
    孔祥林压制民主、压制批评的行为是一贯的，他一向存在“家丑不可外扬”的思想。去年区委书记杨殿阁写信给东北人民政府高岗主席和东北日报，批评岫岩县政府对牲口进行防疫工作时，注射疫苗不及时，耽误了春耕。当高岗主席派人去检查时，孔祥林就质问杨殿阁：“为什么不向县委反映，偏向上面写？”去年八月间，报社张雪峰到岫岩调查粮食问题时，孔祥林曾向宣传部长胡国钧说：“咱们说话得谨慎点啊！记者那玩艺沾边就赖……”孔祥林向上级报告工作时，总是报喜不报忧，满篇成绩，隐瞒缺点。
    此外，孔祥林还包庇有错误的干部。例如纵容前岫岩县县长兼法院院长满士毅毒打老婆、强迫与老婆离婚的违反婚姻法行为。县妇联主任高淑英为此向孔祥林提出处理意见。但孔祥林不但不作正确处理，还打击高淑英。县委宣传部长胡国钧，作风恶劣，工作消极，在干部中影响很坏，有人对胡国钧提出了一些批评，但孔却诬蔑批评的人是“进攻领导”。在“三反”运动后，并把胡国钧提拔为县委委员。总之孔祥林的这种抗拒批评，对批评者进行报复的行为，已达到令人不能容忍的地步，应该予以严肃处理。
