    Special-Class Labor Model Zhou Chuandian
    Since the beginning of February this year, our production department has been organizing an acceptance team to inspect the No. 8 blast furnace project. This is a new, large-scale mechanized and automated furnace equipped with excellent instruments manufactured by Soviet factories. This blast furnace marks the beginning of a technological transformation in our country's iron and steel industry. I am proud of the boundless development prospects of our motherland's industry.
    Soviet experts designed the No. 8 blast furnace according to the latest Soviet standards, and the Soviet people equipped our blast furnace with the latest equipment. This blast furnace is a good school for me and for everyone. The new technological equipment has broadened our horizons, and from it, we deeply appreciate the high level of Soviet technology and the great friendship of the Soviet people.
    Now the No. 8 blast furnace has started production. Just thinking about how many tens of thousands of tons of pig iron it will produce during the first Five-Year Plan to support the country's large-scale economic construction, we can't help but happily look at the newly painted furnace soaring into the clouds and the red flag flying on the furnace top more than once, and shout loudly!
    One of the characteristics of the No. 8 blast furnace is the mechanization of operations. Let's start with the charging system. In the old blast furnace's raw material warehouse, when ore was leaked into the charging cans, workers had to open the leakage door in a tense and laborious manner amidst the flying mineral dust. In the No. 8 blast furnace, these tasks are replaced by compressed air. The driver sits at a clean operating table and lets the compressed air automatically open and close the leakage door, mixes the ingredients, and sends them to the bottom of the skip hoist. The skip hoist operator no longer holds the brake with his hands and steps on the brake with his feet, anxiously starting the hoist like in the past. Now, one person in a beautiful small room on the ground turns the electric switch to send the charging can to the top of the furnace, and then compressed air automatically presses open the furnace bell to let the furnace charge fall into the furnace.
    Anyone who has seen an iron smelting furnace can appreciate the arduousness of the work in front of the furnace. The furnace workers must brave the gas, brave the splashing slag water and molten iron, to open and close the iron tap and slag tap. After the iron is tapped, they must clean the dozens of meters long iron ditch and slag ditch, and on the hot iron slag, carry away the residual iron and broken slag basket by basket, and then transport clay, coke powder, and river sand to pave the ditch. Today, all of this is mechanized and electrified. The newly installed slag tap plugging machine opens and closes the slag tap by the traction of compressed air, and the electric drill for the iron tap will quickly open the iron door. As long as one person sits comfortably in the electric cannon operating room, one clay gun can seal the iron door. Look at the old furnaces (which will undoubtedly be automated soon), seven or eight people take turns using sledgehammers to hit, and it takes thirty minutes to open the iron door. It is even more difficult to block the iron door. The first furnace worker stands next to the hot iron ditch to operate the mud gun, and four people pass the mud balls to stuff into the mud gun's eye. Even with unprecedented improvements in operating skills today, it is sometimes inevitable to be burned by the fire.
    The work of carrying away broken slag and residual iron and transporting sand is also no longer done by manpower, but replaced by cranes. As long as one furnace worker operates the crane, he can do the work of many people in the past.
    The second characteristic of the No. 8 blast furnace is the automatic control devices. There are four electric tram lines under the mine tunnel. The skip charging car stops on whichever track you want it to, according to your wishes, and automatically lifts the ore. The hanger workers from the old-fashioned blast furnaces, thinking of how they stepped on the edge of the can hundreds of times a day to hang the hook, should be happy to see this!
    Everyone knows that charging the blast furnace according to the specified material line has a decisive effect on the production of the blast furnace. We launched a campaign to eliminate low material lines in 1950, but we still cannot completely achieve correct charging today. The new automatic control equipment solves this problem. After the material line is specified, the furnace lid cannot be opened if the material line is not reached, and the charging car stops automatically. You have to charge according to the material line, and it is impossible to violate the rules.
    The regulation of wind temperature is also a key issue in mastering production. In the old blast furnaces, the gas worker constantly shook the regulating valve, but the wind temperature often differed by ten to fifteen degrees Celsius. The new instruments completely change this operating method. As long as the wind temperature is specified, it will automatically and accurately regulate to this temperature, and no one needs to regulate it anymore.
    The third characteristic of the No. 8 blast furnace is a large number of excellent monitoring instruments, all with automatic recording devices. The furnace's own changes every second, every hour, every day, and the changes in operations are accurately recorded on specially made recording paper. These instruments can report to us at any time anything we should know, and must know. If some aspects of blast furnace operation are still purely technical, these new devices will enable us to gradually progress to scientifically mastering the blast furnace.
    The fourth characteristic of the No. 8 blast furnace is the high concentration of technology. Blast furnace production is quite complex. Air supply, power generation, gas supply, water supply, and the loading of raw materials are all closely related to the blast furnace. The blast furnace is the center of this complex production. Due to the increase in a large number of instruments, the duty technician can get a comprehensive understanding of the work situation in all locations by looking around the signal room. If you are careful and check the recording paper, you can understand what changes have occurred in the past few minutes or hours, and then make various requirements to those who operate those devices to ensure the normal operation of the furnace.
    The equipment itself also takes this into account, and various indication devices are connected to various departments. For example, if you want to load one more can of coke, you only need to press a switch, and the mining tunnel hoist will know it. This is not wonderful. What is wonderful is that they must load it according to this instruction. If they don't load coke and want to load ore, there is no need to supervise, the machine itself will not let them load.
    Nothing can escape the technician's eyes, and all technical instructions are decided by the technician. This is a high concentration of technology, ensuring the full play of the blast furnace technician's role.
    The fifth characteristic of the No. 8 blast furnace is the strict safety equipment. In addition to the great improvements that have been made in the safety work in front of the furnace, as mentioned above, the skip hoist distribution panel alone has one hundred and twenty-four relays, which control each other to ensure safe operation. The area between the skip charging car and each track in the mine tunnel is the most prone to problems. It is designated as a dangerous area. For example, if you specify loading on the second tram line, the cars on all other lines cannot enter the dangerous area. Moreover, if the ore car on the second track has not reached the hanging can position, the hoist cannot be started, which ensures that no car rolling accidents will occur.
    Finally, the design of the No. 8 blast furnace has a large reserve of power that can be fully utilized. At the same time, steam blowing equipment, furnace condition gas sampling equipment, and automatic air-steam regulation devices are installed to promote new technology operations, which will greatly promote future technological development.
    The repair of the No. 8 blast furnace has filled all the workers of the iron smelting plant with a fighting spirit, and learning new equipment and mastering new technologies has become a craze. A few months ago, furnace workers who didn't even have basic electrical knowledge have overcome the difficulties of old age and poor memory, and the difficulties of too low education levels, and have learned to accurately master cranes and electric cannons; and will explain its structure and principles to you, making you doubt that they are veterans in this field. Each of us has been educated about the country's first Five-Year Plan, and deeply understands the arduous and glorious tasks we have in the first Five-Year Plan. Therefore, we hope to put our wisdom, abilities, and enthusiasm into this glorious cause as quickly as possible, so that the blast furnace can quickly enter normal production.
    Cheer for the start of construction of the motherland's first mechanized and automated blast furnace!
    Strive to achieve an excellent volume utilization coefficient!

    为祖国第一个自动化炼铁炉开工而欢呼
    鞍钢炼铁厂副厂长
    特等劳动模范  周传典
    从今年二月初起，我们生产部门就开始组织验收队，验收八高炉的工程。这是一个新的大的机械化和自动化的炉子，装备着出色的苏联工厂制造的各种仪器。这座高炉，是我国钢铁工业技术改变的开端。我为祖国工业的无限发展前途骄傲。
    苏联专家以苏联最新标准设计了八高炉，苏联人民用最新式的设备装备了我们的高炉。这个高炉对于我和对于大家是一个很好的学校。新的技术装备开拓了我们的眼界，从这里我们深刻体会到苏联技术的高度水平和苏联人民的伟大友谊。
    现在八高炉已开炉生产了，只要一想到在第一个五年计划中它将出产多少万吨的生铁支援全国大规模经济建设，我们便不禁高兴地不只一次地看着那新油漆的直插入云霄的炉子和炉顶飘扬的红旗，高声欢呼！
    八高炉的特点之一是操作机械化。让我们从装料系统看起罢。在旧高炉的原料仓库下，把矿石漏进料罐里去时，工人们要在矿粉飞扬中紧张地费力地拉开漏门。在八高炉，这些工作都被压缩空气代替了。司机手坐在清洁的操作台上，让压缩空气自动开闭漏门，配好料送到卷扬斜桥下。卷扬手也不像过去那样手摸着闸，脚踩着闸，提心吊胆的开动卷扬机。现在，一个人在地面上的一间漂亮小房里，扭动电的开闭器，就把料罐送到炉顶上去，再由压缩空气自动压开炉盏，让炉料落到炉子里去。
    看过炼铁炉的人，都能体会到炉前工作的繁重。炉前工人必须冒着瓦斯，冒着喷溅的渣水铁水，开闭铁口和渣口。出完铁后又必须清理几十公尺长的铁沟和渣沟，在高热的铁渣上边，一筐一筐地把残铁碎渣抬走，再运来黏土、焦粉、河沙，把沟子铺好。而今天这一切都机械化电气化了，新安装的渣口堵塞机，由压缩空气的牵动开闭渣口，铁口电钻会迅速地打开铁门，只要一个人舒适地坐在电炮操纵室里，一炮泥就可把铁门封住。看看旧炉子罢（毫无疑问，它们都会很快就自动化的），七、八个人轮换用大锤去打，三十分钟才能把铁门打开，堵铁门时更困难，第一炉前工站在高热的铁沟旁边操纵泥炮，四个人在传递泥球往泥炮眼里塞，即使在操作技术空前提高的今天，也难免有时喷火伤人。
    抬走碎渣残铁和运来沙子的工作，也不用人力，而改用了吊车。只要一个炉前工开动吊车，就可以做着过去很多人的工作。
    八高炉的特点之二是自动控制的装置。矿洞底下有四条电车道，卷扬装料车随着人的意愿，让它在那一条道上停止，它就在那条道上停下，自己把矿石吊起来。从老式高炉来的挂罐工人，想到他每天成百次地踏着罐边把挂钩挂好，看看这个，真应该高兴呀！
    谁都知道，高炉按规定料线装料对高炉的生产有决定性的作用，我们从一九五○年起就发起消灭低料线运动，但是到今天还不能完全达到正确装料。新的自动控制设备解决了这个问题，料线经指定之后，不到料线炉盖就不能打开，装料车自动停止，料就装不上去，逼着你非按料线装料不可，想违犯规程也不可能。
    风温的调节也是掌握生产的关键问题。旧的高炉，瓦斯工不停地摇调节弁，但风温还时常相差摄氏十度到十五度。新的计器完全改变了这个操作法，只要把风温指定之后，它会自动地精确地调节到这个温度，再也不需要人去调节它了。
    八高炉的特点之三是大量出色的监测仪器。并且都带有自动记录装置。每秒每时每天炉子本身的变化情况及操作变化情况都精确记录在特制的记录纸上，凡是我们应该知道的，须要知道的情况，这些仪器都可以随时报告我们。如果说有些地方高炉操作还是纯技艺的，则这些新的设备会使我们逐渐进步到能科学地掌握高炉了。
    八高炉的特点之四是技术的高度集中。高炉生产是相当复杂的。送风、发电、瓦斯供应、水的供应、原料的装入，都和高炉息息相关，高炉是这个复杂生产的中心。由于大量计器的增设，现在值班技术员坐在信号室用眼睛转一圈，就可全面了解各处的工作情况。如果细心一点，检查一下记录纸，就可了解它们过去几分钟几小时发生些什么变化，从而对操纵那些设备的人提出各种使炉子正常操作的要求。
    设备的本身也照顾到这一点，各种指示装置通连到各个部门去。比如说你要多装一罐焦炭，只需把一个开关按动，矿洞卷扬机就都知道了。这还不算奇妙，奇妙的是他们非按照这个指示去装不可。如果他们不装焦炭而想装矿石，用不着去监督，机械本身就不让他们装。
    什么事都跳不过技术员的眼睛，什么技术指示都由技术员来决定，这是技术的高度集中，保证充分发挥高炉技术员的作用。
    八高炉的特点之五是严密的安全设备。除了炉前的安全工作如上面说过的那样，已有巨大改进外，光卷扬配电盘就有一百二十四个继电器，互相控制，保证安全运转。在卷扬装料车和矿洞各道间是最容易发生问题的地方，把它划成了危险区，比如你指定在二电车道装料，其它各条道的车就不能进入危险区。而且第二道的矿石车如没有达到挂罐位置，卷扬机也就开不下来，这就保证了不会发生卷车事故。
    最后，八高炉的设计是有着很大后备力量可以充分利用的。同时，为推行新技术操作，安装蒸气鼓风设备，炉况瓦斯取样设备和风汽自动调节装置等，这些，对将来技术的发展都很有推动的作用。
    八高炉的修复，使炼铁厂全体职工都充满战斗情绪，学习新设备掌握新技术变成一种热潮。几月前连电气基本知识都没有的炉前工人，已克服了年龄大记忆差的困难，克服了文化程度太低的困难，学会精确地掌握吊车和电炮；而且会向你说明它的构造和原理，使你不能不怀疑他们是这一方面的老手。我们每一个人都经过关于国家第一个五年计划的教育，深刻地体会到我们在第一个五年计划中的艰巨而又光荣的任务。因此我们希望尽可能快些把我们的智慧、能力和积极性投入这一光荣事业，使高炉迅速转入正常生产。
    为祖国第一个机械化自动化的高炉开工而欢呼！
    为达到优良的容积利用系数而奋斗！
