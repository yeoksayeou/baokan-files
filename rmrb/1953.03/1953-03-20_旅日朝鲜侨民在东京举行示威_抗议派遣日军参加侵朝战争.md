    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 18th: Thousands of Korean residents in Japan held a demonstration in Tokyo on the 16th, demanding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea and opposing the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' dispatch of Japanese troops to participate in the war of aggression against Korea. The demonstration took place at the Japanese Diet and government buildings, the U.S. Embassy in Japan, the headquarters of General Clark, and the location of the U.S. Army Command in downtown Tokyo. Demonstrators also held placards with slogans such as "Oppose the Japan-South Korea Talks" and "Oppose Conscription into the South Korean Army," protesting Yoshida's collusion with Syngman Rhee in a conspiracy to forcibly send Korean residents in Japan to South Korea as cannon fodder.

    【新华社十八日讯】东京消息：成千名的旅日朝鲜侨民十六日在东京举行示威，要求外国军队从朝鲜撤退，反对美、日反动派派遣日本军队参加侵朝战争。示威是在日本国会和政府、美国驻日大使馆、克拉克总部和在东京闹市的驻日美国陆军司令部的所在地举行的。示威者手里还拿着“反对日韩会谈”、“反对征去当韩国兵”等标语牌，抗议吉田和李承晚相勾结，阴谋把旅日朝鲜侨民强制送往南朝鲜充当炮灰。
