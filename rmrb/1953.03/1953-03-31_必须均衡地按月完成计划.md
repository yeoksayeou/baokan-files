    It is Necessary to Fulfill the Plan Evenly on a Monthly Basis
    In January and February of this year, many factories and mines in various regions failed to fulfill their production plans. Some factories and mines, although they fulfilled the gross output value target, did not complete the main products. Although there are various reasons for this, such as lax management, work stoppages due to accidents, high defect rates affecting finished product output, and poor preparation leading to untimely material supply, the most important, most common, and fundamental reason is that the management personnel of these factories and mines lack the concept of fulfilling the national plan evenly and have not vigorously organized rhythmic production. They are only satisfied with completing the annual gross output value target, focusing only on completing the annual task, and neglecting to fulfill the plan evenly on a ten-day or monthly basis. Therefore, in the first half of each month, the first one or two months of a quarter, and the first one or two quarters of a year, they often relax their leadership over production; and place the hope of completing the monthly plan in the last ten and a half days, the hope of completing the quarterly plan in the last month, and the hope of completing the annual plan in the last quarter. As a result, they often fail to complete the plan, or although the gross output value is completed, the plan for product variety and quality is not completed.
    In these factories and mines, there are only vague annual and quarterly plan figures for the entire factory; and there are no specific monthly and daily targets for each workshop, each team, and even each individual. Or, even if so-called "operation plans" are formally prepared, these plans are merely decorations in the office, not known or grasped by the masses, and have not become the masses' own action plans. In these factories and mines, production management is often in a state of chaos: sometimes there are serious phenomena of work stoppages and idleness; sometimes overtime work is done to rush tasks; machines often have accidents and suffer great damage; product quality is very poor, and there are many defective and substandard products; workers are overworked, affecting their health; material consumption rates are very high, causing waste, and so on. In particular, because the plan cannot be fulfilled evenly on a monthly basis, many intermediate products cannot be supplied to other production factories and mines on time according to the plan, and many finished products cannot be supplied to the capital construction departments and trade departments on time according to the plan, resulting in disconnections between various production departments and between supply and marketing, which affects the entire economic management work from advancing harmoniously, causing great harm to national construction.
    In order to reverse the current situation of failing to complete the plan, and in order to fundamentally change this long-term situation of not being able to complete the plan evenly, all factories and mines across the country must extensively and deeply mobilize all employees in the work of discussing the national plan, to ensure the realization and over-fulfillment of the national plan, and on this basis, improve the enterprise's planning management—formulate monthly and ten-day operation plans for each workshop, team, and individual, and gradually realize the organization of rhythmic production according to the instruction charts based on specific conditions.
    At present, there are still many regions and competent departments that have not arranged the work of discussing the plan; although some regions have carried out this work, and the masses in many factories and mines have been relatively fully mobilized, they have never explicitly put forward the requirements of strengthening plan management and organizing balanced production, and have not clearly pointed out that after the masses discuss the plan, the results of the mass discussion should be consolidated with the enterprise management system and organized with the operation plan, so that the realization of the advanced plans discussed and formulated by the masses has a real guarantee. This situation must be further changed.
    All regions and units that have not yet started mobilizing the masses to discuss the plan should immediately mobilize the masses, expose various shortcomings in production, strengthen weak links, and create various advanced norms, to prepare for the next step of compiling operation plans and organizing balanced production. Those who have already mobilized the masses to discuss the plan should conduct supplementary lessons, re-establish or improve the operation plan, and implement it among the masses, so that organizing balanced production and completing the national plan rhythmically on an advanced basis becomes the conscious action of all employees.

### 必须均衡地按月完成计划

    必须均衡地按月完成计划
    今年一、二月份，各地有许多厂矿没有完成生产计划。有的厂矿虽然完成了产总值的指标，但主要产品没有完成。这虽然有各种原因，如有的由于管理松弛，因发生事故而停工，有的由于废品多，影响成品产量，有的由于准备工作差，材料不能及时供应等等；但最主要、最普遍、并且带有根本性的原因，就在于这些厂矿的管理人员缺乏均衡地完成国家计划的观念，没有大力组织有节奏的生产。他们只满足于完成全年生产总值的指标，只着眼于完成全年任务，而忽视均衡地按旬按月地完成计划。因此，他们在每个月的前半月，一季度的前一两个月，一年的前一两季，往往放松对生产的领导；而把完成月计划的希望放在最后的十天半月，把完成季度计划的希望放在最后一个月，把完成年度计划的希望放在最后一季。这样，实际上就常常完不成计划，或者虽然完成了生产总值，产品品种和质量的计划却没有完成。
    在这些厂矿中，只有笼统的全厂的年度计划和季度计划数字；而没有每个车间，每个班组，以至每个人的每月、每日的具体指标。或者是形式上也编制了所谓“作业计划”，但这个计划只是办公室里的装饰品，没有被群众所熟知，所掌握，没有成为群众自己的行动计划。在这些厂矿中，生产管理经常陷于混乱状态：有时停工、窝工现象严重；有时为了突击任务而加班加点；机器经常发生事故，耗损很大；产品质量很差，废品次品很多；职工疲劳过度，影响健康；材料消耗率很大，造成浪费等等。而特别是由于不能均衡地按月完成计划，许多中间产品不能及时地按计划供应其他生产厂矿，许多成品不能及时地按计划供应基本建设部门和贸易部门，造成各个生产部门之间和供销之间的脱节现象，以致影响整个经济管理工作不能合拍地前进，给国家建设带来很大危害。
    为了扭转目前这种完不成计划的状况，为了从根本上改变这种长期不能均衡地完成计划的状况，全国一切厂矿必须在讨论国家计划的工作中，广泛深入地发动全体职工，保证国家计划的实现和超额实现，并在这基础上改进企业的计划管理——制订出每个车间、小组、个人的每月每旬的作业计划，根据具体情况逐步实现按指示图表组织有节奏的生产。
    现在还有很多地区和业务主管部门没有布置讨论计划的工作；虽然有的地区进行了这一工作，也有不少厂矿中的群众发动得比较充分，但是始终没有明确提出加强计划管理、组织均衡生产的要求，没有明确指出要在群众讨论计划之后，把群众讨论的成果用企业管理制度巩固起来，用作业计划组织起来，使群众讨论和制订出的先进计划的实现有切实的保证。这种情况，必须进一步加以改变。
    所有还没有开始发动群众讨论计划的地区和单位，应该立即发动群众，揭发生产中各种缺点，加强薄弱的环节，创造各种先进的定额，为下一步编制作业计划、组织均衡生产做好准备。已经发动群众讨论过计划的，要进行补课，重新建立或健全作业计划，把它贯彻到群众中去，使组织均衡生产、在先进的基础上有节奏地完成国家计划变成全体职工的自觉行动。
