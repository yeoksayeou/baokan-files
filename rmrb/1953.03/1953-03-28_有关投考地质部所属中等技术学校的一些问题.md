    Editor's Note: After the People's Daily published Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech at the National Geological Work Planning Conference on December 19, 1952, Zheng Boyi, Wang Yuguan and other seven students from Shanghai Bile Middle School, as well as many other young people from various places, wrote to Vice Premier Chen Yun, the Ministry of Geology, and this newspaper, expressing their determination to participate in geological work and raising questions about the conditions and application procedures for secondary technical schools affiliated with the Ministry of Geology. We have now asked the Ministry of Geology to provide a comprehensive response to the above questions:

    I. The Ministry of Geology is preparing to establish secondary technical schools in six cities: Hankou, Nanjing, Chongqing, Changchun, Xi'an, and Xuanhua, such as the Nanjing Geological School in Nanjing and the Wuhan Industrial School in Hankou.

    II. The schools will have departments of geology, surveying and mapping, chemical analysis, physics, prospecting, and mine geology, and will also have training courses for accounting and statistical personnel or Russian language classes.

    III. Application requirements for each school: Young men and women aged 18 to 25, free from chronic infectious diseases, physically strong, with junior high school education and appropriate supporting documents, are eligible to apply. The duration of study is either one and a half or two years. After graduation, the Ministry of Geology will uniformly assign jobs. Students can enjoy People's Scholarship benefits during their studies. Enrollment time is during this year's summer vacation. Please pay attention to enrollment news or advertisements in the newspapers at that time.

    有关投考地质部所属中等技术学校的一些问题
    编者按：一九五二年十二月十九日本报发表了陈云副总理在全国地质工作计划会议上的讲话后，上海市比乐中学郑伯夷、汪于官等七人和各地不少青年分别给陈云副总理、地质部和本报来信，表示了他们参加地质工作的决心，并对地质部所属中等技术学校的情况和投考办法等方面提出了一些问题。现请地质部对上述问题综合答复如下：
    一、地质部在汉口、南京、重庆、长春、西安、宣化六个城市都筹设中等技术学校，如南京的南京地质学校，汉口的武汉工业学校等。
    二、各校设有地质、测绘、化验、物理、探矿、矿山地质等科，并附设会计统计人员训练班或俄文班。
    三、各校报考条件：十八岁以上二十五岁以下的男女青年，无慢性传染病、身体强健而具有初中文化程度并有适当证明文件者，均可报考。修业期限分一年半、二年两种。毕业后由地质部统一分配工作。学习期间可享受人民助学金待遇。招生时间在今年暑假，请届时注意报载招生消息或广告。
