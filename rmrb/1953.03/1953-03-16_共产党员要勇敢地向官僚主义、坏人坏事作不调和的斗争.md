    Communist Party Members Must Bravely Wage Uncompromising Struggle Against Bureaucracy and Bad People and Deeds
    Xu Bangyi
    Adhering to the Party's high degree of principle and persisting in uncompromising struggle against various phenomena within the Party that deviate from the Party's principles is one of the concrete manifestations of the Party spirit of every Communist Party member. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "Combat Liberalism": "A Communist Party member should be open and frank, loyal, active, regard revolutionary interests as his first life, subordinate personal interests to revolutionary interests; adhere to correct principles at all times and in all places, wage tireless struggle against all incorrect thoughts and behaviors, so as to consolidate the collective life of the Party, consolidate the Party's ties with the masses; care for the Party and the masses more than for oneself, care for others more than for oneself. Only in this way can one be considered a Communist Party member." The Constitution of the Communist Party of China also stipulates in the obligations of Party members: "Strictly abide by Party discipline, actively participate in the Party's political life and the domestic revolutionary movement, practically implement the Party's policies and the resolutions of Party organizations, and struggle against all phenomena inside and outside the Party that harm the Party's interests." This means that every Party member should firmly stand on the Party's position and wage a resolute struggle against all anti-Party and anti-people thoughts and behaviors within the Party, so as to thoroughly eliminate these various erroneous tendencies that endanger the Party's cause.

    Therefore, our Party has always attached importance to adhering to correct principled struggle and persisting in principled struggle. During the great "Three-Anti" movement, the principle of many Communist Party members was strengthened. Instead of adopting a passive attitude towards various principled errors, they adopted an active attitude and persisted in waging uncompromising struggle against bureaucracy and bad people and deeds. Wang Shixun, former director of the Inspection Department of the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and other comrades adhered to the Party's principles in handling the embezzlement case of the Wuhan Municipal Second Hospital, causing the anti-Party activities of people like Zhou Jifang and Song Yingzhi to go bankrupt. Li Kecai, a comrade from the Tianjin Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Hebei Province, boldly exposed the crimes of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, enabling the Tianjin Prefectural Committee to be rectified. Fan Wenxing, the former deputy secretary of the Dingxian Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, did not abandon the struggle because he was in the minority in the principled struggle, and did not compromise with the anti-Party elements. These are precisely the manifestations that a Communist Party member should have. However, within our Party, not every Communist Party member can stand on the Party's position and adhere to the correct principled struggle. Some Communist Party members are subjectively dissatisfied with the bureaucracy and bad people and deeds within the Party. They can also carry out some struggles against bureaucracy and bad people and deeds, but they cannot carry the struggle to the end. They can only lightly and fragmentarily put forward some weak criticisms and suggestions for serious events. This is because in the struggle, they are constantly considering personal issues. Some are afraid of ruining "relationships" and making it difficult to work together in the future; some are afraid that the problem will not be solved and they will be retaliated against; some are afraid that the problem will become "big" and affect their "relationship" with their superiors. Therefore, although they also struggle with bad elements, when bad elements scare them, they are defeated and dare not persist in the struggle. May I ask: If a Communist Party member does not dare to go to the front line in the struggle against the enemy, or fires two shots and immediately turns around and runs away, isn't this a "coward"? How shameful is this for a Communist Party member? If one is brave in the struggle against the enemy, why is one timid towards the anti-Party bad elements? Why be so generous towards them? Since we resolutely oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries, why don't we dare to completely eliminate the Kuomintang style that has invaded our Party? This means that these Communist Party members have not thoroughly distinguished the boundaries between themselves and these bad elements ideologically. Some members of the Dingxian Prefectural Committee clearly dissatisfied with Wang Zhenhai's anti-Party and anti-people behavior, but could not persist in the struggle like Fan Wenxing, and instead expressed compromise to Wang Zhenhai. The dregs of individualism still exist in the minds of these Communist Party members. Remove these dregs, and courage will emerge.

    Some people, again, have serious liberalism. They turn a blind eye to bad people and deeds. These people do not resent, advise, stop, or explain behaviors that harm the interests of the masses, but let them go unchecked. They even intentionally or unintentionally shield bad elements with vulgar personal feelings, local sentiments, and sectarianism, and defend bad elements with non-Party attitudes. In the Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan incident, in the Huang Yifeng incident, in the Wang Zhenhai incident, and in the struggle against other bad people and deeds, a few Communist Party members have adopted this extremely erroneous liberal attitude. The masses have already been persecuted, but the Communist Party members are indifferent and take it lightly. Where has the Party spirit of these Communist Party members gone? Comrade Mao Zedong said in "Combat Liberalism": "Liberalism is a manifestation of opportunism and is fundamentally in conflict with Marxism." If Communist Party members adopt a liberal attitude towards bureaucracy, bad people and deeds, the people will suffer! If Communist Party members overcome liberalism, bureaucracy, bad people and deeds will have nowhere to hide, and the people will gain freedom and happiness.

    Communist Party members must remember that they are political activists and should always fight to uphold this principle or that principle. A Communist Party member who does not adhere to principled struggle is a political mediocrity. Regarding this kind of political mediocrity, Comrade Stalin once used a sentence from the great Russian writer Gogol to describe them in his speeches at the two voters' meetings in the Stalin electoral district of Moscow: "These are uncertain people, neither fish nor fowl, you can't tell what they are, neither like humans nor like ghosts."

    Regarding the issue of carrying out principled struggle within the Party, some people have worriedly asked: "Won't this cause disunity within the Party?" No, it won't. Our Party is not a club, not a restaurant, not a family group, but a fighting revolutionary party united on the basis of common thought and a common political program. Therefore, the unity of our Party is not unprincipled unity, not based on personal interests and personal feelings, but on the ideological consistency of Marxism-Leninism and on the Party's program and Party principles as the basis of unity. Under the Party's principles, all Communist Party members should show great comradely love and mutual trust; however, when someone deviates from the Party's principles in thought and action and violates the interests of the Party and the people, then no matter how long they have known each other, how good their personal feelings are, whether they are their old superiors or old subordinates, they should promptly carry out principled struggle in order to truly guarantee the Party's principled unity. Otherwise, the Party's unity will not be consolidated.

    The principle of Communists must not tolerate treating bureaucracy and bad people and deeds with personal feelings or by handling family affairs. To be a principled Communist Party member, one should point out someone's mistakes directly, boldly, frankly, and sharply, without fear of offending anyone. Of course, in places lacking democratic sunshine, in the struggle against bureaucracy, bad people and deeds, some people may suffer attacks and retaliation from bad elements, but dark phenomena can only be local and temporary. Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee, as well as the broad masses of Communist Party members and the people of the whole country, actively support this just struggle. As long as we believe in the Party, believe in the masses, the Party's correct principled struggle will surely achieve victory.

    共产党员要勇敢地向官僚主义、坏人坏事作不调和的斗争
    许邦仪
    坚持党的高度的原则性，坚持和党内存在着的各种脱离党的原则的现象进行不调和的斗争，是每个共产党员党性的具体表现之一。毛泽东同志在“反对自由主义”一文中说：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益；无论何时何地，坚持正确的原则，同一切不正确的思想和行为作不疲倦的斗争，用以巩固党的集体生活，巩固党和群众的联系；关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。这样才算得一个共产党员。”中国共产党党章关于党员的义务中也有这样一条规定：“严格地遵守党纪，积极参加党内的政治生活和国内的革命运动，实际执行党的政策和党的组织的决议，和党内党外一切损害党的利益的现象进行斗争。”这就是说，每个党员都应当坚定地站在党的立场和党内的一切反党反人民的思想和行为，进行坚决的斗争，以彻底清除这些危害党的事业的各种错误倾向。
    因此，在我们党内从来就是重视坚持正确的原则斗争，坚持着原则斗争的。在伟大的“三反”运动中，许多共产党员的原则性是加强了。对于各种原则性的错误，没有采取消极的态度，而是采取了积极的态度，坚持不懈地向官僚主义、坏人坏事作不调和的斗争。前中共武汉市委纪律检查委员会检查处处长王世勋等同志在处理武汉市立第二医院盗款案件中坚持了党的原则，使周季方、宋瑛之流的反党活动遭受破产。河北省天津专署李克才同志大胆揭发刘青山、张子善的罪行，使天津地委组织得到了整顿。中共定县地委前任副书记范文兴在原则性的斗争中没有因为自己陷入少数的地位而放弃斗争，没有和反党分子妥协。这些正是一个共产党员应有的表现。但是，在我们党内，并不是每个共产党员都能够站在党的立场上，坚持正确的原则斗争的。有一些共产党员，主观上对于党内的官僚主义、坏人坏事是不满意的。他们对于官僚主义、坏人坏事也能够进行一些斗争，但不能把斗争进行到底。他们对于严重事件却只能轻描淡写地、零零碎碎地提出一些软弱无力的批评和建议。这因为他们在斗争中，还不断地考虑到个人的问题，有的怕把“关系”搞坏了，以后不好在一起工作；有的怕问题解决不了，受到打击报复；有的怕问题搞“大”了，影响与上级的“关系”。因而他们虽然也和坏分子进行斗争，但是当着坏分子向他们吓唬的时候，他们就败阵下来，再也不敢坚持斗争。请问：如果在对敌斗争中，一个共产党员不敢上火线，或者放了两枪马上回头就跑，这不就是一个“懦夫”吗？这对于共产党员说来是多么可耻的事情呢？如果在对敌斗争中是勇敢的，为什么对于反党的坏分子就反而胆怯了呢？就反而宽宏大量了呢？我们既然坚决地反对国民党反动派，为什么对于侵入我们党内的国民党作风反而不敢彻底消灭它呢？这就是说，这一些共产党员还没有和这些坏分子从思想上彻底地分清界限。定县地委会中有些地委委员，明明不满意王振海的反党反人民的行为，但却不能和范文兴一样地坚持斗争，而向王振海表示妥协。在这一些共产党员的头脑中还存在着个人主义的渣滓。把这些渣滓去掉，勇气就会出来。
    又有些人，存在着严重的自由主义。他们对于坏人坏事，熟视无睹。这些人见了损害群众利益的行为不愤恨，不劝告，不制止，不解释，听之任之。甚至以庸俗的私人感情、乡土观念及宗派主义等非党态度有意无意地包庇坏分子，为坏分子辩护。在刘青山、张子善事件中，在黄逸峰事件中，在王振海事件中，以及对于其他的坏人坏事的斗争中，都有少数共产党员采取了这种极端错误的自由主义态度。群众已经受到迫害，而共产党员竟然无动于衷，等闲视之，这些共产党员的党性究竟跑到什么地方去了呢？毛泽东同志在“反对自由主义”一文中说：“自由主义是机会主义的一种表现，是和马克思主义根本冲突的。”共产党员对于官僚主义，坏人坏事采取自由主义态度，就会使人民遭殃！共产党员如果克服了自由主义，就会使官僚主义、坏人坏事没有藏身之所，人民就会得到自由幸福。
    共产党员必须记得自己是一个政治活动家，总是应该为拥护这个原则或那个原则而实行斗争的。不坚持原则性斗争的共产党员，是一个政治上的庸人。对于这种政治上的庸人，斯大林同志在莫斯科城斯大林选区两次选民大会上的演说中，曾经用俄国伟大作家果戈里的一句话来形容他们：“这是些不确定的人，不三不四，简直使你认不出他们究竟是什么人，既不像人，又不像鬼。”
    对于在党内展开原则性斗争的问题，曾有人耽心地问：“这不会造成党内的不团结吗？”不会的。我们的党，不是俱乐部，不是餐厅，不是家族团体，而是在共同思想和共同政治纲领上团结起来的战斗的革命的政党。因此我们党的团结，不是无原则的团结，不是以私人利益和私人感情作为团结的基础，而是以马克思列宁主义的思想上的一致，以党的纲领和党的原则作为团结基础的。在党的原则下，所有的共产党员应表现出同志间的伟大友爱和互相信任；可是，当有人在思想意识和行动方面脱离了党的原则，违反了党和人民的利益时，则不管彼此相处多久，私人感情多好，不论是自己的老上级或老下级，都应及时开展原则性的斗争，才能真正保障党的原则性的统一和团结。否则，党的团结就是不巩固的。
    共产党人的原则性决不能容忍以私人感情或用处理家务的办法来对待官僚主义和坏人坏事。做一个有原则性的共产党员，就应该直爽、大胆、坦白、尖锐地指出某人的错误，不怕得罪任何人。当然，在缺乏民主阳光的地方，在和官僚主义、坏人坏事作斗争中，也许有人会遭受坏分子的打击和报复，但是，黑暗的现象只能是局部的、暂时的。毛泽东同志和党中央以及广大的共产党员、全国的人民群众都是积极支持这一正义斗争的。只要相信党，相信群众，党的正确的原则斗争是一定会取得胜利的。
