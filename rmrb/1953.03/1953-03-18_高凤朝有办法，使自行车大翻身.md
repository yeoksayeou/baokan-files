Gao Fengchao Has a Way to Make Bicycles a Big Hit
By Our Reporter Fu Dong

    Gao Fengchao is a sales clerk at the Beijing Department Store's First Wholesale Department. In the second half of last year, he found a market for more than 11,000 coaster brake bicycles. Including other goods, he sold a total of 26 billion yuan worth of goods, accounting for 36 percent of the wholesale department's total sales. Many people asked Gao Fengchao: What is your secret to improving your business? Gao Fengchao said: "Extensively contacting the masses, studying their needs and difficulties, finding ways to solve their difficulties, and satisfying their needs, that is the secret."
    The Beijing Department Store's warehouse was full of unsold goods. Last July, when the company launched the patriotic labor emulation campaign, leading cadres called for the promotion of bicycles. Many bicycles had been in the warehouse for more than a year, taking up a lot of space and tying up a lot of capital. This call made Gao Fengchao think of his daily commute by bus or trolley. Gao Fengchao's dormitory was far from the company. Every morning, he had to catch a bus or trolley to work. Because there were so many people taking the bus, sometimes he had to wait several trips to squeeze on. On the bus, he often heard people say, "If only I had a bicycle!" These words aroused his deep interest and attention. He thought: "Why do so many people want bicycles, but the bicycles in the warehouse can't be sold? What's the problem here? Can it be solved?" At this time, he was transferred to be an outside salesman to promote bicycles. With a fiery enthusiasm, he ran around the streets every day. As long as he saw a sign of an organization at the door, he would go in and ask if they wanted bicycles. But he always met with rejection. People either complained that the price was too high, or that the coaster brake bicycles were not easy to ride. Some people shook their heads as soon as they heard that they were "New Brand" bicycles. After running around for more than twenty days, he didn't sell many bicycles. "What to do?" He carefully recalled the process of being rejected, thinking that he only knew how to run around all day, but he didn't look for different customers based on the different qualities of the existing bicycles. He also didn't conduct in-depth research on a department to see how many employees wanted to buy bicycles, what their salaries were, whether they could afford bicycles, and whether there was a way to solve the employees' difficulties in buying bicycles. He hadn't investigated and studied these issues in depth, so naturally his sales performance couldn't be great. He thought that although there were many employees in the Ministry of Railways, not many of them had bicycles, so he made the Ministry of Railways one of the key points for promoting bicycles, and first found the chairman of the trade union there to understand the situation. When he passed by the supply department of the Ministry of Railways, he saw many employees crowded at the door to buy things. This caught Gao Fengchao's attention, and he went to find out. The comrades in the supply department said that they didn't have any slow-selling goods at all, and many things were sold out as soon as they arrived. Even more expensive items such as watches and pens were in short supply. It turned out that in order to take care of the economic conditions of the employees, the supply department of the Ministry of Railways implemented a method of taking the goods first and deducting the salary at the end of the month for general commodities. Some commodities could also be paid in installments. This method gave Gao Fengchao great inspiration: "If the internal organs can implement the method of installment deduction, why can't the department store implement the method of installment collection?" Then he went to find the chairman of the trade union in the ministry. The chairman of the trade union said that the salaries of the employees of the Ministry of Railways were not low, but not many people could take out 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan to buy a bicycle at once. Gao Fengchao then asked, "What if you pay in installments?" The chairman of the trade union said that this method was excellent. If you pay in installments, at least hundreds of people would want to buy bicycles. Gao Fengchao also asked him to calculate how much money could be deducted from the general employees' monthly salary without affecting their lives? How many months should a bicycle be paid for the most appropriately? The result of the statistics was: if a bicycle was paid for in six months, with 260,000 yuan deducted each month, about 200 people in the Ministry of Railways would be willing to buy a bicycle. If the date was extended to nine months or a year, it was estimated that at least 500 to 600 people would want to buy a bicycle. Gao Fengchao had a plan in mind, and immediately reflected the situation of the Ministry of Railways to the leaders, and put forward his personal opinion, saying that it was best to set the installment payment period to one year. This method was discussed and decided to be implemented by the leading cadres, but the time limit was set at six months. After the method was implemented, Gao Fengchao went to various organizations, factories to publicize and contact, and notified the units he had contacted before by telephone. After this, the number of people who came to buy cars increased. Employees of the former Tianjin Railway Administration Beijing Branch bought more than 1,800 vehicles at once. But many people also complained that the date was too short. Can the deadline be extended? After discussion by the company's leading cadres, it was changed to nine months. This time, the first wholesale department was really lively. Those organizations, groups, and factories that Gao Fengchao had contacted in the past came to sign contracts after receiving his phone call. The company specially sent two comrades to be responsible for handling this matter, but they were still too busy. 20,000 bicycles were all sold out in half a year (the 11,000 bicycles that Gao Fengchao directly promoted were not included).
    Once, Gao Fengchao went to the Transportation Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission to promote bicycles. The cadres there heard that the company was selling "New Brand" cars, and that they were coaster brakes, so they shook their heads and refused to buy them. No matter how Gao Fengchao introduced and explained, the other party was always a little worried. Gao Fengchao thought to himself: "If I push a car and let them ride it themselves, they will know the quality of the car, and the problem will be easy to solve." The next day, he pushed a "Diamond" brand car to the Transportation Department and asked the responsible comrade to try it out. This time the results were good, and the Transportation Department bought 1,000 bicycles at once, and then continued to buy 4,700 bicycles.
    But some people resolutely refused to buy coaster brake bicycles. Gao Fengchao wondered every night whether coaster brake bicycles could be converted into hand brake bicycles. He and the salesman Wang Jixian tried to modify the bicycles together, but failed many times because the rim was too narrow. Later, a batch of Siemens bicycles came to the company, and the rim was relatively wide, so Wang Jixian modified 460 bicycles. These bicycles were sold immediately after being converted into hand brakes. "Cars can be modified, so why can't hand-cranked sewing machines be converted into foot-pedaled ones?" Gao Fengchao came up with an idea looking at the backlog of hand-cranked sewing machines in the warehouse. He went to ask the company's sewing machine workers, and he also went to the market to inquire. Everyone said that there was no difference in the machine head and that it could be modified. After the hand-cranked sewing machine was equipped with a frame and converted into a foot-pedaled one, it only sold for 1.8 million yuan, which was cheaper than the original foot-pedaled sewing machine. Good quality and low price, it was quickly sold out.
    Gao Fengchao has now established fixed business relationships with dozens of organizations, groups, and factories. Whenever a place needs any goods, they come to him, and he also actively contacts them by phone. He has taken hold of many deals that were considered "impossible" in the past, and large quantities of goods that had been backlogged for a long time have found smooth sales channels.

    高凤朝有办法，使自行车大翻身
    本报记者　傅冬
    高凤朝是北京市百货公司第一批发部的售货员。他在去年下半年给一万一千多辆脚闸自行车找到了销路；加上其他商品，他一共卖了二百六十多亿元的货，占批发部销货总额的百分之三十六。不少的人问高凤朝：你提高业务的窍门是什么？高凤朝说：“广泛地联系群众，研究群众的需要和困难，想办法解决群众的困难，满足群众的需要，这就是窍门。”
    北京市百货公司仓库里积压着许多商品。去年七月，公司开展爱国主义劳动竞赛运动的时候，领导干部号召推销自行车。许多自行车已经在库里放了
    一年多，占的地方很大，积压了很多资金。这个号召使高凤朝联想起他每天上下班赶乘公共汽车或电车时的情形。高凤朝的宿舍离公司很远。每天早上要赶乘公共汽车或电车上班。因为乘车的人很多，有时要等几趟车才能挤上去。在车上，他常听人这样说：“要有一辆自行车就好了！”这种话引起他深厚的兴趣和注意。他想：“为什么那么多人想要自行车，库房里的自行车又卖不出去呢？这里面到底有什么问题？能不能解决呢？”就在这时，他被调为外勤，推销自行车。他有火一样的热情，天天在街上跑来跑去，只要看见门口有机关的牌子，就进去问人家要不要自行车？但他总是碰钉子。人家不是嫌价钱贵，就是嫌是脚闸车不好骑，有些人一听说是新牌车，就摇头不要。跑了二十多天，没销掉几辆自行车。“怎么办呢？”他仔细地回想着碰钉子的过程，想到自己一天只知道跑路，但是没有根据现存各种车子不同的品质，寻找不同的顾主。又没有深入地研究过一个部门，看看到底有多少职工想买车子？他们的薪金有多少？能否买得起车？有没有办法解决职工买车的困难？这些问题都没有深入调查研究过，自己心中无数，推销成绩自然不能大了。他想，铁道部的职工虽然很多，但有自行车的人并不多，于是就把铁道部作为推销自行车的重点之一，先找那里的工会主席了解一下情况。当他经过铁道部的供应处时，看见许多职工拥挤在门口买东西。这件事引起高凤朝的注意，他去了解情况。供应处的同志说，他们那里根本没有什么冷背货，许多东西都是一到就卖光了。像手表、钢笔这些比较贵重的物品，也都是供不应求。原来铁道部供应处为了照顾职工的经济条件，实行了一般商品先取货，到月底再扣薪水的办法。有些商品还可以分期扣款。这办法给了高凤朝很大的启发：
    “机关内部可以实行分期扣款的办法，百货公司为什么不可以实行分期收款的办法呢？”接着他就去找部里的工会主席。工会主席说，铁道部职工的薪水不算低，但一下子能拿出一百五六十万元买一辆自行车的人没有多少。高凤朝这时就问：“如果分期付款怎么样？”工会主席说，这办法好极了，如果分期付款，起码有几百人要买自行车。高凤朝又请他计算了一下，一般职工每月扣多少钱不影响生活？一辆自行车要分几个月付款最合适？统计的结果是：如果一辆自行车分六个月扣款，每月扣二十六万元，铁道部约有二百人愿意买车。假如把日期放宽到九个月或一年，估计至少有五、六百人要买车。高凤朝心里有了个谱，立即把铁道部的情况反映给领导人，并提出他个人的意见说，最好把分期付款的期限订为一年。这办法经过领导干部研究讨论，决定实行，但将限期订为六个月。办法实行以后，高凤朝又到各机关、工厂宣传联系，并用电话通知以前联系过的单位。这以后，来买车的人增多了。原天津铁路管理局北京分局职工一次就买了一千八百多辆。但也有很多人提意见说，日期太短了。能不能把期限放宽一些？经过公司领导干部讨论，又改为九个月。这一来，第一批发部真热闹了。高凤朝过去联系过的那些机关、团体、工厂，得到他的电话后，都来订合同。公司里专派了两位同志负责处理这件事，还忙不过来。二万辆自行车在半年里就统统卖光了（高凤朝直接推销的一万一千多辆车没包括在内）。
    有一次，高凤朝到人民革命军事委员会运输处去推销自行车。那里的干部听说公司卖的都是新牌子车，又是脚蹬闸，就摇头不买。任凭高凤朝怎样介绍与解说，对方总有点不放心。高凤朝心里想：“推个车子让他们亲自骑骑，他们知道了车子的质量，问题就好办了。第二天他就推了个钻石牌的车子去，请运输处的负责同志试试。这一次成绩不错，运输处一下子就买了一千辆自行车，以后又继续买了四千七百辆。
    但也有一些人坚决不要脚闸自行车。高凤朝每天晚上回来就捉摸，看脚闸自行车能不能改成手闸自行车。他和售货员王继先一同设法改装自行车，但因瓦圈太窄，许多次都失败了。后来公司里来了
    一批西门生牌自行车，瓦圈比较宽，王继先就动手改了四百六十辆。这些自行车改成手闸后，马上就卖掉了。“车可能改，手摇缝纫机怎么不能改成脚蹬的？”高凤朝望着仓库里积压的手摇缝纫机出开了主意，他去问公司的缝纫机工人，他又跑到市场上去打听，所有的人都说机头没差别，可以改。手摇缝纫机配了个架子改成脚蹬的以后，一台才卖一百八十万元，比原来的脚蹬缝纫机还便宜。物美价廉，很快地就销掉了。
    高凤朝目前已经和几十个机关、团体、工厂建立了固定的业务关系，那一个地方需要什么货物，就跑来找他，他也主动的用电话联系。他拉住许多在过去认为是“做不成的买卖”，积压很久的大批货物都找到了畅顺的销路。
