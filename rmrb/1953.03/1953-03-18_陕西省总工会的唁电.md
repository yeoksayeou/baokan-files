    In these sorrowful days of Comrade Stalin's passing, the news of the unfortunate death of Comrade Gottwald, the most beloved leader of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Czechoslovakian people, and a close friend of the Chinese people, has added to the grief of the working class of our entire province.
