Correcting the Tendency to Blindly Establish and Expand Agricultural Production Cooperatives

The deviations that occurred in Daming County, Hebei Province, during the trial implementation of agricultural production cooperatives, serve as a lesson that leading cadres in many rural mutual aid and cooperation movements should seriously heed. This is because similar tendencies of blind and rash advancement exist to varying degrees in the trial implementation of agricultural production cooperatives in many regions. Some counties, with very little experience in leading agricultural production cooperatives, put forward slogans such as "Every village establishes a cooperative, every district establishes a large cooperative." In some areas, the conditions for establishing agricultural production cooperatives were extremely immature, and they did not hesitate to dismantle mutual aid teams, concentrating the backbone members of each team to establish agricultural production cooperatives. As a result, agricultural production cooperatives were established, mutual aid teams collapsed, and individual farmers increased. In some areas, agricultural production cooperatives had just been established, and their foundation was still very weak, yet they blindly and extensively accumulated public property, pricing all the members' draft animals and farm tools as shares in the cooperative, so that members had not seen any actual production results but were already burdened with debt. This adventurous tendency, which does not proceed from reality and violates the laws of development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, not only hinders the normal development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement but also directly hits the production enthusiasm of farmers, creating difficulties for this year's patriotic production increase movement. If these erroneous practices continue, the consequences are unimaginable.

It is now the spring plowing season, and mobilizing and organizing all farmers to enter spring plowing production is the current urgent task. The leading organs in all areas where these deviations have occurred should immediately organize capable cadres to conduct in-depth inspections and rectifications of the agricultural production cooperatives that have been established, and earnestly help them solve various problems that hinder the current production tasks. Agricultural production cooperatives that lack the conditions for establishment or have been established in violation of the principle of voluntary participation by the masses should allow the masses to withdraw freely or be reorganized into mutual aid teams. For agricultural production cooperatives that meet the conditions, leadership must be strengthened to specifically help them improve their management and operation, so that they can be truly consolidated and truly play a demonstrative role in this year's production movement. In those villages where farmers are restless due to the forced establishment of agricultural production cooperatives by district and village cadres, the policy of mutual aid and cooperation should be immediately explained to stabilize the farmers' production mood. To do this work well, the leading organs in various localities should seize the time to help relevant cadres in counties, districts, and villages carefully study the mutual aid and cooperation policies stipulated by the Party, so that they can truly recognize the serious harm of blind and rash advancement. This is the key to ensuring the successful inspection and rectification of agricultural production cooperatives.

    纠正盲目建立和扩大农业生产合作社的偏向
    河北省大名县在试办农业生产合作社的过程中所发生的偏向，对许多领导农村互助合作运动的干部，都是一个值得严重注意的教训。这是因为不少地区在试办农业生产合作社的工作中，都或多或少地存在着类似的盲目冒进的倾向。有的县在十分缺乏领导农业生产合作社的经验的情况下，就提出“村村办社，区区办大社”的口号；有的地区创办农业生产合作社的条件极不成熟，竟不惜拆散互助组，把各组的骨干分子集中起来，创办农业生产合作社。结果，农业生产合作社办起来了，互助组垮台了，单干户增多了；有的地区刚刚创办了农业生产合作社，它的底子还很空虚，就盲目地大量地积累公共财产，把社员的耕畜、农具全部作价入社，以致社员还没有见到一点生产实效，就负了一身的债务。这种不从实际出发、违反互助合作运动发展规律的冒险倾向，不仅阻碍了互助合作运动的正常发展，而且直接打击了农民的生产积极性，给今年的爱国增产运动造成了困难。这些错误作法如果继续下去，其恶果是不堪设想的。
    目前已到春耕季节，动员与组织全体农民进入春耕生产，是当前的刻不容缓的急迫任务。所有发生过这些偏向地区的领导机关，应该立即组织得力干部，深入检查、整顿已经建立起来的农业生产合作社，认真帮助他们解决妨碍当前生产任务的各种问题。凡是缺乏建社条件和违反群众自愿原则建立起来的农业生产合作社，应让群众自由退出，或是改组为互助组；对于合于条件的农业生产合作社，必须加强领导，具体地帮助它们改善经营管理的状况，使它们真正巩固下来，在今年的生产运动中真正发挥示范作用；在那些由于区、村干部强迫建立农业生产合作社而使农民动荡不安的村庄，要立即讲清互助合作政策，稳定农民的生产情绪。为了作好这种工作，各地领导机关应该抓紧时间，帮助县、区、村有关干部仔细学习党所规定的互助合作政策，使他们真正认识到盲目冒进的严重危害性。这是保证作好检查整顿农业生产合作社工作的关键。
