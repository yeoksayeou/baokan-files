    The Consolidation of the Democratic World Market
    Suslin, Soviet Union
    J.V. Stalin, in his brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," pointed out that the most important economic result of the Second World War and its economic impact was the division of the unified, all-encompassing world market into two parallel and mutually opposed world markets. The democratic world market, though existing for a short time, has already taken shape and is being consolidated and developed successfully.
    
    The Imperialist Plan to Economically Strangle the Democratic Camp Has Failed
    The United States, Britain, and France have implemented an economic blockade against the Soviet Union, China, and the European People's Democratic countries, attempting to economically strangle these countries. However, the imperialists miscalculated, because in fact, it did not strangle them but strengthened the democratic world market instead.
    
    Since the end of the war, American imperialism has been pursuing a policy of attempting to economically strangle the Soviet Union. As early as 1945, the United States introduced discriminatory regulations under which all Soviet orders submitted to American companies had to be processed by the U.S. State Department first. The State Department used this as a means to force the provision of detailed information such as which Soviet factories would receive the equipment, where these factories were located, what equipment they already had, their production capacity and expansion prospects, the number of workers employed, what they manufactured, and where the products were sold, etc. Needless to say, these brazen demands for extorting economic intelligence and blatant interference in the Soviet Union's internal affairs were rejected. After failing to achieve these goals, the State Department ordered a ban on exports to the Soviet Union, especially industrial equipment, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, steel sheets for automobiles, tinplate, and tin tubes.
    
    American imperialism's clear aim was to strike a blow at the Soviet automobile and canning industries. It knew that at the time, the Soviet steel sheet and tinplate factories had been destroyed in the war and had not yet been restored, and that Western Europe was unable to supply such goods. However, its plan failed, because Soviet workers and technicians produced the necessary steel sheets and tinplate in due time, and our industry proceeded smoothly without American assistance.
    
    American imperialism's plot to delay the development of the Soviet oil and gas industries by prohibiting the export of steel pipes to the Soviet Union also failed in the same way. The gas pipelines from Saratov to Moscow and from Dashava to Kiev were built in a timely manner, and the output of the Soviet oil industry, equipped with Soviet-made machinery, increased to 47 million tons in 1952. These facts irrefutably demonstrate how futile and hopeless all the attempts and plans of American imperialism to delay the economic development of the Soviet Union are.
    
    The United States also adopted the same methods for orders from the People's Democratic countries. Czechoslovakia placed an order in the United States, and the payment was made long ago, but the goods have never been seen.
    
    The U.S. government soon progressed from trade discrimination to an open economic blockade against the Soviet Union, the European People's Democratic countries, and China. The United States unilaterally abolished trade agreements with the aforementioned countries, effectively severing trade relations with them completely. At the same time, American imperialism ordered Britain, France, West Germany, and other vassal states to stop trading with the democratic camp, or to reduce trade to a minimum. As a result, Britain and France stopped more than 250 orders for the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, none of which could be classified as strategic materials.
    
    The U.S. Congress, with the aim of stopping all trade between capitalist countries and the democratic camp, passed the Kem Amendment in June 1951 and the Battle Act in October of the same year. These two laws stipulated that any capitalist country that violated the U.S. ban and continued to maintain trade relations with the democratic camp would no longer receive U.S. "aid."
    
    The bosses of the capitalist world should have understood from the many examples of the past few years that the plan to economically strangle the Soviet Union and countries friendly to the Soviet Union will never have a chance of success. The completion of the Soviet Union's first five-year plan for the restoration and development of the national economy after the war has completely shattered these ideas of American imperialism. The Soviet Union's enormous assistance to other countries in the democratic camp has also effectively shattered the American plan to economically strangle these countries. All these schemes carried out by Washington only prove once again that the United States has turned foreign trade, a tool for mutual exchange and international cooperation, into a weapon to economically harm other countries. At the same time, it has also proved that when the United States uses this weapon against the countries of the democratic camp, it is ineffective. This can be seen from the following examples:
    
    After the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, a weakness in its heavy industry was the insufficient capacity of blast furnaces. Democratic Germany had complete equipment for machine manufacturing, steel smelting, and steel rolling, but it lacked pig iron; without pig iron, the steel smelting and machine manufacturing equipment could hardly operate. Before and after the war, until the Anglo-American group split Germany, East Germany had always obtained pig iron from West Germany, especially pig iron from the Ruhr. However, after imperialism split Germany, it adopted a policy of economic blockade against Democratic Germany, and one of its initial steps was to prohibit the export of pig iron to Democratic Germany, attempting to paralyze its heavy industry. This plan completely failed. The Soviet Union, adhering to the principles of international cooperation, assisted the German Democratic Republic by supplying pig iron continuously for several years. At the same time, Democratic Germany also built its own blast furnaces. The "East" steel joint factory is being accelerated, and its four blast furnaces have already started operating. By the end of the five-year plan (1955), the steel production of Democratic Germany will be 313 percent of that in 1950, and the pig iron will be 594 percent of that in 1950. The imbalance in the economy can be eliminated.
    
    The American policy of trade discrimination and economic blockade has gone bankrupt. The above examples have irrefutably demonstrated that the Soviet Union, China, and the European People's Democratic countries, due to close economic cooperation and mutual assistance, and hoping to achieve common economic prosperity, cannot be harmed by economic blockade. The countries that make up the democratic world market have abundant resources, and they are growing rapidly economically and developing foreign trade successfully. However, on the imperialist side, by implementing discriminatory policies, they are cutting themselves off from the democratic world market. This will certainly hit their own export trade and further shrink their sales market. There is no doubt that this will sharpen the contradiction between the industrial production capacity of capitalist countries and the possibility of finding markets for products.
    
    For Britain and West Germany, stopping or largely stopping trade with the Eastern countries belonging to the socialist camp has proven to be particularly harmful. These two countries traditionally exported goods to Eastern countries and imported food raw materials and industrial raw materials from the Soviet Union, China, and the European People's Democratic countries. Now they themselves have lost rich sources of supply and sales.
    
    The Successful Development of the Democratic World Market
    The democratic world market includes eleven countries united by brotherly friendship - the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, the German Democratic Republic, the Mongolian People's republic, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with a total population of 800 million, accounting for one-third of the world's population. They possess endless mineral resources and everything needed for people's lives and social development. These truly free countries have established new cooperative and mutually beneficial relationships based on complete equality and mutual respect for national independence and sovereignty. The basis of this cooperation is mutual assistance and the desire to achieve common economic prosperity. Through joint efforts, all countries have made great progress in industry, trade, and culture.
    
    The abundant human and natural resources of the countries in the democratic camp can fully guarantee economic development, and planned economy enables all countries to rationally utilize these resources and accelerate the expansion of productive forces. Planned economy is also a guarantee for preventing crises and other evils of the capitalist system.
    
    Before the Second World War, China, Korea, and Central and Southeastern Europe were markets controlled by imperialism. Their trade with the Soviet Union was negligible.
    
    After the end of the Second World War, the situation changed dramatically. China and the European People's Democratic countries broke away from the capitalist system and, together with the Soviet Union, formed a powerful and united socialist camp and a vast democratic market. In a very short period of time, the countries of the socialist camp have achieved remarkable achievements.
    
    In 1951, Poland's industrial production was 290 percent of pre-war levels, Czechoslovakia was 170 percent, Hungary was 250 percent, Romania was 190 percent, Bulgaria was 460 percent, and Albania was more than 500 percent.
    
    This provides a solid foundation for the smooth development of trade between the Soviet Union, China, and the European People's Democratic countries. It is enough to explain one fact: trade between the countries of the democratic camp increased more than threefold from 1948 to 1952. The Soviet Union's foreign trade volume has tripled compared to before the war, 80 percent of which is conducted with countries friendly to the Soviet Union. The People's Democratic countries export industrial products and agricultural products to the Soviet Union.
    
    The following are the figures for the foreign trade of the European People's Democratic countries in 1951 compared to 1946 (with 1946 as 100): Poland - 617, Czechoslovakia - 370, Romania - 1198, Hungary - 1169, Bulgaria - 231.
    
    The direction of foreign trade of the People's Democratic countries has also naturally changed. Exports to capitalist countries have decreased, while exports to the democratic camp have increased.
    
    It should be particularly pointed out that the change in the proportion of trade between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. In 1951, trade with the Soviet Union accounted for 25 percent of Poland's total exports, 28 percent for Czechoslovakia, 29 percent for Hungary, 51 percent for Romania, 58 percent for Bulgaria, and 57 percent for Albania.
    
    It must be particularly pointed out that there is absolutely no price dispute, mutual deception, and extortion in the democratic world market, which are the characteristics of the capitalist market. Similarly, there is absolutely no attempt to monopolize, expand, or seize the market in the relations between the countries of the democratic camp. In the democratic world market, there are no such things as blockades, bans on trade, dumping, unequal exchange, monopolies, competition, commercial wars, protectionist tariffs, tariff barriers, foreign exchange deficits, bankruptcies, high prices, maximum profits, speculative hoarding, and speculative selling, which are common in the capitalist market. Trade in the democratic world market is conducted on the inviolable principles of equality between both sides, economic cooperation, mutual assistance, balanced trade, long-term agreements, and fair prices.
    
    Economic Development of the Democratic Camp and Soviet Aid
    The economic relations between the Soviet Union and China, which has broken away from the capitalist system, and the European People's Democratic countries naturally have a special nature. There are no contradictions and conflicts between the countries of the democratic camp, on the contrary, there is only the identity of political and economic interests. J.V. Stalin wrote: "The question is first of all that the basis of this cooperation is the sincere desire for mutual assistance and the achievement of common economic prosperity."
    
    The main ways of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the countries of the democratic camp are as follows: foreign trade, scientific and technological assistance, joint development of natural resources, exchange of scientific and technological experience, organization of joint-stock companies, mutual assistance in training personnel, etc. In this relationship, the mutual coordination of the economic plans of the countries participating in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is extremely important. For example, countries have signed agreements on the production of steel pipes. Usually, manufacturing all types of steel pipes in one factory would reduce production efficiency because machines need to be constantly reassembled. The People's Democratic countries agree that one country only produces certain types of steel pipes and exchanges other types with other countries. This can reduce production costs and increase output.
    
    The Soviet Union's comprehensive and selfless assistance is an important factor in the economic progress of the People's Republic of China and the European People's Democratic countries.
    
    The Soviet Union supplies these countries with various raw materials and machinery, from iron ore to complete sets of equipment for various factories, power stations, and industrial complexes. Some of the modern large-scale industrial constructions in countries such as Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, such as Poland's Nowa Huta steel joint factory, are assisted by the Soviet Union and equipped with new Soviet-made machinery. The Soviet Union's exports of new-style machinery to the People's Democratic countries in 1952 were ten times higher than in 1948.
    
    In addition to supplying industrial equipment and valuable raw materials, as well as providing loans and credit, the Soviet Union provides scientific and technological assistance to the People's Democratic countries under technical cooperation agreements. This has proven to be extremely important in the economic development of all countries. Soviet experts assist in exploring mineral sources, improving mining methods, providing valuable advice for formulating economic plans, assisting in designing factories and selecting construction sites, etc. The Soviet Union also provides the People's Democratic countries with plans, instructions, drawings, and other technical documents free of charge, helping these countries accelerate industrialization as much as possible.
    
    In addition to Soviet assistance, mutual assistance between the People's Democratic countries is another factor in the industrial development of all countries. For example, Czechoslovakia participated in Bulgaria's power station development plan. According to the Bulgarian News Agency, over the past five years, Czechoslovakia has manufactured and installed 15 sets of thermal and hydroelectric power equipment for Bulgaria, with a total power exceeding the capacity of all power stations in Bulgaria in the past.
    
    Economic Isolationism or Restoring International Trade?
    In the context of the maturing crisis phenomenon in the capitalist world, the bankruptcy of the American policy of blockading the democratic camp and the achievements of these countries are becoming increasingly obvious. The industrial technology level of the factories that the People's Democratic countries are now building has greatly exceeded that of the advanced capitalist countries. There is not a single factory in the countries of Western Europe that can compare with Poland's Nowa Huta steel joint factory, Warsaw's alloy factory, Hungary's Danube steel joint factory, etc. in terms of technical equipment.
    
    The imperialists are powerless to prevent the People's Democratic countries from building the foundations of socialism. They cannot even prevent the Soviet Union from victoriously building communism. Among those more practical and somewhat insightful representatives of the bourgeoisie, many are gradually realizing that no force can stop these countries from moving forward, because facts have proven that it is the blockaders themselves who suffer from the so-called blockade, not those who are blockaded.
    
    It is worth noting that the call for restoring trade with the Soviet Union, China, and the European People's Democratic countries is getting louder and louder in Western countries. In Britain, France, West Germany, and other countries, more and more bourgeois spokesmen are in favor of restoring trade with democratic countries.
    
    In colonies and dependencies, the desire to trade with the democratic world market is also extremely strong. Recently, trade between these countries and the democratic camp has increased significantly. At the end of 1952, Poland signed trade agreements with Argentina, Brazil, Greece, and Iran. Poland exports coal, cement, chemical products, timber, sugar, machinery and tools, textiles, paper, and livestock, and imports wool, hides, cotton, iron ore, etc. Czechoslovakia has signed trade agreements with Syria, Lebanon, Argentina, and Belgium and Luxembourg. The Argentine newspaper "Economist" commented on the Czech-Argentine trade agreement, saying that although Czechoslovakia's proportion in Argentina's total foreign trade is not large, it is very important because, first, Czechoslovakia's goods are of high quality; second, this agreement is signed with a People's Democratic country.
    
    All these facts show that any attempt by imperialism to isolate countries and prevent international economic, trade, and cultural exchanges is doomed to fail. The democratic world market has become such an important factor in the international situation that those rulers of the capitalist world have to consider it more and more seriously.

    民主世界市场的巩固
    苏联　苏斯林
    约·维·斯大林在其天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中曾指出，统一的无所不包的世界市场分裂为两个平行的也是互相对立的世界市场，是第二次世界大战及其经济影响在经济方面最重要的结果。民主世界市场，存在时间虽还不久，但它已经形成，并且正日益巩固和顺利发展中。
    帝国主义在经济上窒杀民主阵营的计划失败了
    美国、英国和法国对苏联、中国和欧洲人民民主国家实行经济封锁，企图从经济上窒杀这些国家。但是，帝国主义者失算了，因为事实上却并没有窒杀得了，反而加强了民主世界市场。
    自从战争结束以来，美帝国主义就执行着从经济上企图窒杀苏联的政策。早在一九四五年，美国即提出一些歧视性的规定，在这些规定之下，所有提交给美国公司的苏联的订货单，都要先在美国国务院办理手续。国务院就借此迫使提供详细的情报如苏联什么工厂将收到这些装备，此等工厂在何处，已有哪些设备，生产能力和扩充的前途如何，雇用工人的数目，制造什么东西以及产品运销何处等等细节。不用说，这些勒索经济情报和对苏联内政的公开干涉的厚颜无耻的要求，是被拒绝了。国务院在不能达到这些目的后，就下令禁止对苏出口，特别是不准工业装备、铁与非铁金属、汽车用钢板、锡板和锡管等输往苏联。
    美帝国主义的显明目的在于打击苏联汽车和罐头工业。它知道当时苏联的钢板和锡板的工厂毁于战火尚未恢复，而且西欧无力供给此种货品。不过，它的计划失败了，因为苏联工人和技术人员在适当的时间内把必需的钢板和锡板生产了出来，我们的工业没有美国帮助依然顺利进行。
    美帝国主义禁止钢管输往苏联，企图推迟苏联石油工业和煤气工业发展的阴谋，同样地失败了。从萨拉托夫到莫斯科和从达沙瓦到基辅的煤气管适时地建设起来了，由苏联自造机器装备起来的苏联石油工业的产量，在一九五二年增加到四千七百万吨。这些事实都无可辩驳地说明了美帝国主义推迟苏联经济发展的一切企图和计划是多么徒然而又无望。
    美国对于人民民主国家的订货也采用同样手法。捷克斯洛伐克在美国订的货，款早付清，却从未见货。
    美国政府不久即由贸易歧视进而为公开地对苏联、欧洲人民民主国家和中国的经济封锁。美国曾片面地废止了同上述国家间的贸易协定，实际上就是完全割断同这些国家间的贸易。同时，美帝国主义又命令英国、法国、西德及其他仆从国家停止对民主阵营的贸易，或则把贸易减少至最小限度。英国和法国因此停止了输往苏联和人民民主国家的二百五十项以上的订货，而其中并无一项可以列为战略物资。
    美国国会，以停止资本主义国家和民主阵营之间的全部贸易为目的，于一九五一年六月通过了肯姆修正案，同年十月又通过了巴特尔法。这两种法令规定：对破坏美国禁令而与民主阵营继续保持贸易关系的任何资本主义国家，不再给予美“援”。
    资本主义世界的老板们，应该从过去几年中不少的事例中明白，从经济上窒杀苏联和与苏联友好的国家的计划是永不会有成功的机会的。苏联战后第一个恢复和发展国民经济的五年计划的完成，已经完全粉碎了美帝国主义这些念头。苏联对民主阵营其他各国的巨大援助，同样也有效地粉碎了美国从经济上窒杀这些国家的计划。华盛顿所进行的这一切图谋，只是再一次地证明，美国已把对外贸易这一互相往来和国际合作的工具变成为从经济上损害他国的武器。同时也已证明了：当美国以这一武器去反对民主阵营各国时，也是无效的。这可以从下述事例中看出来：
    德意志民主共和国成立后，重工业机构中一个弱点是鼓风炉容量的不足。民主德国有完备的机器制造、熔钢和钢材辗压设备，然而缺少生铁；没有生铁，熔钢和机器制造的设备就难以开动。战争前后，直至美英集团分裂德国为止，东德一向从西德得到生铁，特别是鲁尔的生铁。但是，帝国主义分裂德国后即采取对民主德国实行经济封锁的政策，其最初的步骤之一即为禁止生铁输出民主德国，企图借此瘫痪它的重工业。这个计划完全失败了。坚持国际合作原则的苏联援助了德意志民主共和国，几年来不间断地供给了生铁。同时，民主德国也建立了自己的鼓风炉。“东方”钢铁联合工厂正在加速修建，它的四个鼓风炉已经开始使用。民主德国到五年计划完成时（一九五五年），钢的产量将为一九五○年的百分之三一三，生铁将为一九五○年的百分之五九四。经济中不平衡的现象就可以消除了。
    美国贸易歧视和经济封锁的政策是破产了。上述例证已经不容置辩地说明：苏联、中国和欧洲人民民主国家由于在经济上密切合作，互相帮助，希望求得共同经济的高涨，这不是经济封锁所能损害得了的。组成民主世界市场的各国拥有丰富的资源，它们在经济上迅速地增长，并顺利地发展对外贸易。但是在帝国主义一方面，由于实行歧视政策，却自绝于民主世界市场。这样当然就打击了它们自己的出口贸易，并进一步缩小了它们的销货市场。毫无疑问，这将使资本主义国家的工业生产能力和为产品寻找市场的可能性之间的矛盾，更为尖锐化。
    对于英国和西德来说，和属于社会主义阵营的东方国家全部停止或绝大部分停止贸易，已经证明是特别有害的。这两国在传统上向东方各国输出货物并自苏联、中国和欧洲人民民主国家输入食品原料和工业原料。现在是它们自己失去了丰富的供销泉源。
    民主世界市场的顺利发展
    民主世界市场包括十一个以兄弟般友谊结合起来的国家——苏联、中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、德意志民主共和国、蒙古人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，人口共八亿，占全世界的三分之一。他们拥有无尽的矿藏和人民生活与社会发展所需的一切。这些真正自由的国家，在完全平等和互相尊重国家独立与主权的基础上，建立了新的合作互助的关系。这种合作的基础是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的愿望。由于共同努力，各国在工业、贸易和文化方面都有了长足的进展。
    民主阵营各国丰富的人力和自然资源可以充分保证经济发展，计划经济又使各国能够合理利用这些资源，加速扩大生产力。计划经济同时也是防止危机及资本主义制度其他恶果的保证。
    在第二次世界大战前，中国、朝鲜和中部及东南部欧洲，都是帝国主义控制下的市场。它们与苏联的贸易微不足道。
    第二次世界大战结束以后，形势急剧地转变了。中国和欧洲人民民主国家脱离了资本主义体系和苏联一起组成强大团结的社会主义阵营和广大的民主市场。在很短的时间内，社会主义阵营各国都获得了显著的成就。
    一九五一年，波兰工业生产为战前水平的百分之二九○，捷克斯洛伐克为百分之一七○，匈牙利为百分之二五○，罗马尼亚为百分之一九○，保加利亚为百分之四六○，阿尔巴尼亚则为百分之五百以上。
    这就对苏联、中国和欧洲人民民主国家间顺利发展贸易提供了坚实基础。只要说明下面一个事实就够了：民主阵营各国间的贸易从一九四八年到一九五二年增加了三倍多。苏联对外贸易数量增为战前的三倍，其中百分之八十是和对苏友好的国家进行的。人民民主国家向苏联出口的有工业制品，也有农产品。
    下面为欧洲人民民主国家一九五一年的对外贸易和一九四六年相比的数字（以一九四六年为一百）：波兰——六一七，捷克斯洛伐克——三七○，罗马尼亚——一一九八，匈牙利——一一六九，保加利亚——二三一。
    人民民主国家对外贸易的方向自然也已改变。输往资本主义国家者已经下降，输往民主阵营者增多。
    应该特别指出的是苏联同人民民主国家贸易的比重上的变化。一九五一年，波兰出口中对苏贸易占总额百分之二十五，捷克斯洛伐克为百分之二十八，匈牙利为百分之二十九，罗马尼亚为百分之五十一，保加利亚为百分之五十八，阿尔巴尼亚为百分之五十七。
    必须特别指出，民主世界市场绝对没有争论价格、互相欺骗和豪取强夺的情形，而这些正是资本主义市场的特色。同样，民主阵营各国间的关系中也绝对没有任何垄断、扩张和占有市场的企图。在民主世界市场上也没有这样的事情：封锁、禁止通商、倾销、不等价交换、垄断、竞争、商业战、保护关税、关税壁垒、外汇赤字、破产、高物价、最大限度的利润、看涨囤购和看落抛售，而这些正是常见之于资本主义市场的。民主世界市场的贸易是依据双方平等、经济合作、互相帮助、平衡贸易、长期协定和公平价格这些不可破坏的原则而进行的。
    民主阵营的经济发展和苏联援助
    苏联和脱离了资本主义制度的中国以及欧洲人民民主国家间的经济关系自然具有特殊的性质。民主阵营各国没有矛盾和冲突，与此相反，只有政治和经济利益的同一性。约·维·斯大林写道：“问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。”
    苏联和民主阵营各国间经济合作的主要方式如下：对外贸易，科学与技术援助，共同开发自然资源，交换科学与技术经验，组织联合股份公司，互相帮助训练人材等等。在这种关系中异常重要的是参加经济互助会议各国的经济计划的相互协调。例如各国签订了关于生产钢管的协定。通常是：在某一个工厂中要制造各种类型的钢管会减低生产效率，因为机器需经常重新装配。人民民主国家间协议一国仅生产一定类型的钢管并与别国交换其他类型。这样就可以减低生产成本，增加产量。
    苏联全面的和大公无私的援助是中华人民共和国和欧洲人民民主国家经济进展中一个重要因素。
    苏联供给这些国家以各种原料和机器，从铁矿石到各种工厂，电力站和工业综合工厂的整套设备。波、匈、罗、保、阿等国国内一些近代化的大规模的工业建设，如波兰的诺伐·胡塔钢铁联合工厂等等都由苏联援助并装配着苏联制造的新型机器。苏联输往人民民主国家的新式机器，一九五二年十倍于一九四八年。
    除供给工业设备和贵重原料以及供给贷款和信用以外，苏联根据技术合作协定给予人民民主国家科学技术援助。这在各国经济发展中已证明是极为重要的。苏联专家协助勘探矿源，改进采矿方法，为制订经济计划提供宝贵意见，协助设计工厂和选择建筑基地等等。苏联也无偿地供给人民民主国家以计划、说明书、图样以及其他技术文件，尽可能帮助这些国家加速工业化。
    除了苏联的援助以外，人民民主国家间的互助，也是各国工业发展的另一个因素。例如，捷克斯洛伐克参加保加利亚电力站发展计划。据保加利亚通讯社报道，过去五年来，捷克斯洛伐克为保加利亚制造并安装了十五部火力和水力发电的装备，总电力超过了保加利亚过去所有电力站的能力。
    经济孤立主义还是恢复国际贸易？
    在资本主义世界危机现象成熟的情况下，美国对民主阵营各国的封锁政策的破产和这些国家获得的成就，表现得日益明显。人民民主国家现在正在建筑的工厂的工业技术水平，已大大地超过了那些先进的资本主义国家。在西欧各国就没有一个工厂在技术设备上能和波兰的诺伐·胡塔钢铁联合工厂、华沙的合金工厂、匈牙利的多瑙河钢铁联合工厂等相比。
    帝国主义者是无力阻止人民民主国家建设社会主义基础的。它们更不能阻止苏联胜利地建设共产主义。在那些比较实际也比较有点眼光的资产阶级代表中，不少人正逐渐认识到：没有任何力量能够阻止这些国家前进，因为事实证明，吃了所谓封锁的亏的，正是封锁者自己，而不是被封锁者。
    值得注意的是在西方国家中要求和苏联、中国与欧洲人民民主国家恢复贸易的呼声正越来越高。在英国、法国、西德及其他国家里，资产阶级发言人愈来愈多地赞成恢复与民主国家的贸易。
    在殖民地和附属国，与民主世界市场进行贸易的愿望也异常强烈。最近，这些国家和民主阵营间贸易已有显著增加。一九五二年底，波兰曾和阿根廷、巴西、希腊和伊朗缔结贸易协定。波兰输出煤、水泥、化学产品、木材、糖、机器和工具、纺织品、纸张和牲畜，进口有羊毛、兽皮、棉花、铁矿石等。捷克斯洛伐克已与叙利亚、黎巴嫩、阿根廷以及比利时、卢森堡等国缔结贸易协定。阿根廷报纸“经济”在评论阿捷贸易协定时说道，虽然捷克斯洛伐克在阿根廷的对外贸易总额中所占比例不大，然而却非常重要，因为第一，捷克斯洛伐克的货物质量高；第二，这个协定是同人民民主国家订立的。
    所有这一切事实都表明，帝国主义想隔绝各国以及阻止国际经济、贸易和文化交流的任何企图都是要失败的。民主世界市场在国际形势中已成为如此重要的一个因素，以至那些资本主义世界的统治者们不得不愈来愈严重地考虑到它。
