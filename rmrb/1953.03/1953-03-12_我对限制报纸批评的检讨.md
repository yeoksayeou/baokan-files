    My Self-Criticism on Restricting Newspaper Criticism
    Han Tianshi, Secretary of the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee
    I completely agree with the criticism of the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee, myself, and other relevant comrades made in the article "Anshan 'Worker's Life' Newspaper Encountered Serious Obstacles from Bureaucrats in Carrying Out Criticism," published in the People's Daily on February 6th. Upon receiving the People's Daily on February 8th, we immediately convened a meeting of the Municipal Committee, and I made a self-criticism at the meeting. The Municipal Committee also held a forum with comrades from the "Worker's Life" newspaper, the Municipal Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission, and the Anshan Municipal People's Government's Supervision Department, incorporating opinions from all sides. The Municipal Committee unanimously believes that the People's Daily's criticism is sincere and correct, and it is a profound education for all cadres and workers in Anshan, as well as for me personally. This criticism has greatly enhanced the enthusiasm of the masses and has greatly promoted the improvement of the work of the Anshan Municipal Committee and various agencies.
    I have committed a principled error in my attitude towards criticism and self-criticism. This error is serious, and it has caused great political losses to the Party. The two letters I gave to the "Worker's Life" newspaper are concrete manifestations of my erroneous treatment of criticism and self-criticism and my violation of the CPC Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" (hereinafter referred to as the Central Decision). This error is the inevitable result of my failure to earnestly study and deeply understand the Central Decision. In addition to sincerely accepting the criticism of the People's Daily, I am willing to resolutely correct it in my work. I will now review the errors I have committed in implementing criticism and self-criticism and in implementing the Central Decision as follows (errors and shortcomings in other areas will be reviewed separately):
    First, the Central Decision of April 19, 1950, pointed out:
    "Attracting the people to publicly criticize the shortcomings and errors in our work in newspapers and publications, and educating Party members, especially Party cadres, to make self-criticism about these shortcomings and errors in newspapers and publications, is of even more prominent importance today." I arrived in Anshan in 1951. After being there for only a month, and without understanding the situation of Anshan's implementation of the Central Decision, I mistakenly believed that the "Worker's Life" newspaper's public criticism of the errors and shortcomings in our work was already "quite a lot." In fact, it was not "quite a lot," but very little; the broad masses of workers were dissatisfied with this situation. For example, in previous mass movements, the workers put forward many criticisms and opinions on the work and leadership, but these opinions were rarely published in newspapers and periodicals. The masses felt that the "Worker's Life" newspaper was "not satisfying" and "dared not criticize." But I did not recognize the true situation of the matter, and became the tail of those who resisted criticism and were unwilling to make public criticism, violating the Central Decision. I did not hear the voice of the broad masses; instead of viewing public criticism as "of prominent importance," I wanted to shrink public criticism.
    The Central Decision stipulates: "The reporters and editors of newspapers and publications shall be independently responsible for all criticisms published in newspapers and publications." "...As long as the newspaper or publication confirms that the criticism is basically correct, it should still be responsible for publishing it, even if it has not sought or obtained the consent of the person being criticized." But I made many restrictions on the criticisms in the newspaper. This could not but affect the enthusiasm of the comrades in the newspaper in carrying out criticism, and could not but affect their courage to fight against resistance, suppression, and restriction of criticism, making the comrades in the newspaper feel that it was still "better to criticize less." As the People's Daily pointed out, many criticism drafts were sent to the criticized units and personnel, but rarely received enthusiastic support and endorsement, and some even suffered abuse or attacks from the criticized. Even if the criticism drafts were published, some were not timely, and some were cut down to be lifeless. Even in 1952, three drafts sent to the Municipal Committee for review had no follow-up. The number of criticism drafts in the "Worker's Life" newspaper also declined as a result.
    Second, I did not adopt a warm, supportive attitude towards public criticism, creating favorable conditions for the critic, and did not, as the Central Decision pointed out: "Therefore, Party leadership organs and cadres at all levels must adopt a revolutionary attitude of warmly welcoming and firmly protecting criticisms reflecting the opinions of the masses, and oppose the bureaucratic attitude of ignoring mass criticisms, restricting publication, and carrying out attacks, retaliation, and ridicule against critics. This is the main aspect today." I did not understand that criticism and self-criticism is a major form of struggle to overcome contradictions among the people, is a struggle between the new and the old, and that the emergence and development of new forces will be restricted and resisted by the old forces. It is not very smooth to carry out public criticism today, but is suffering from many restrictions and resistance. In Anshan, there is far more than the facts revealed in the People's Daily's criticism. For example, some branch secretaries wrongly stipulated that submissions to the newspaper must be reviewed by the branch, which is another example. Some comrades even believe that "the branch has no right to criticize administrative cadres" and that "criticizing intellectuals must be approved by the branch." Some believe that writing criticism drafts for the newspaper or reporting the situation to higher levels is "unorganized and undisciplined." Some retaliate against critics, find fault, "wear small shoes," and use sarcasm and ridicule. For example, some factory directors notified workshop cadres not to provide reporters with materials and ridiculed and abused them, so that many reporters, correspondents, and workers who were courageous in criticizing were restricted and suppressed. But in the past, I failed to pay attention to these facts, and sometimes did not feel righteous indignation even when I saw them.
    On the other hand, the broad masses of people have the completely opposite attitude towards public criticism. They warmly welcome and support the development of public criticism. For example, after the "Worker's Life" newspaper published relatively important criticisms, it received letters from readers expressing their support; readers also criticized those who did not make self-criticism or did not make good self-criticism. In particular, the masses enthusiastically supported the People's Daily's criticism of Anshan on February 6th. They scrambled to read the People's Daily that day and automatically started discussions. On the same day, the "Worker's Life" newspaper also received many letters from readers expressing their support and criticizing those who hindered criticism. The masses reacted extremely well to the People's Daily's criticism. They said: "Only the Communist Party can do this," "There was absolutely no such thing in the old society," "The Communist Party is not afraid of criticism and is not afraid of exposing shortcomings," "Chairman Mao leads well, it's too great." There were many such reactions. This shows that our Party has not lowered its prestige because of public criticism, but has greatly enhanced the enthusiasm of the masses and the Party's prestige. This situation gave me a very profound education, making me more and more aware of my past wrong understanding of criticism and self-criticism. Instead of warmly welcoming and supporting criticism with a revolutionary spirit, I was pointing out that there was too much criticism and that we "should be cautious," showing a bureaucratic attitude. I also took fewer organizational measures to support and protect criticism. For example, in 1952, the "Worker's Life" newspaper published two hundred and eighty-two criticism and suggestion drafts (criticism and suggestion drafts are sometimes difficult to distinguish; the one hundred and eight drafts referred to in the People's Daily article are only one part of the criticism drafts), and ninety-nine of them did not receive public replies, and I did not take organizational measures on this, which damaged the courage and enthusiasm of the masses in carrying out criticism, and increased their concerns about fighting against errors. This cannot but be a reason why the masses have many concerns every time we mobilize them to expose unreasonable phenomena.
    I often think about implementing democratic management, attracting and training workers to participate in production management, but I did not regard criticism and self-criticism as a concrete way to raise the consciousness of the masses, strengthen their sense of ownership, attract them to participate in enterprise management and improve their management skills, and consolidate and strengthen the Party's ties with the masses; nor did I regard it as an important way for the masses to carry out self-education and fight against conservative ideas. I did not realize that only when the broad masses of workers feel that they "can speak," "what they say counts," and participate in various social undertakings, can the revolutionary cause truly become the cause of the masses themselves.
    Third, there is criticism and self-criticism within the Anshan Party organization, but it is loose in ordinary times and tight during movements. Ideologically, I often replace public criticism with internal Party criticism and replace it with discipline. I knew about the mistakes of comrades such as Sha YouShi and Ma Chengde. But I thought that they had already been criticized within the Party, and they had also made self-criticisms, although not deeply, but with progress, so there was no need to criticize them publicly. Regarding Comrade Shen Dongli's mistake, I had criticized him, and he admitted his mistake, so I thought there was no need to criticize him publicly. And the comrades who made mistakes, although they expressed "acceptance" of the Party's criticism, did not correct themselves enough, and still lacked understanding of public self-criticism. I did not realize that the masses should be informed of these comrades' degree of understanding of their mistakes to supervise their correction; at the same time, I failed to make good use of the newspaper, this powerful weapon of propaganda and organization, to carry out this work. Secondly, I was not serious enough in enforcing Party discipline. Although some comrades had committed serious mistakes, I thought that they had made self-criticisms, so there was no need to punish them. I one-sidedly understood the "lenient handling" aspect.
    Fourth, the reason why I made mistakes on the issue of criticism and self-criticism is also due to the existence of the following confused thoughts:
    "Afraid that public criticism will put the leadership in a passive position." In the past, I believed that public criticism by the masses of certain problems that were actually difficult to solve in a short period of time would put the leadership in a passive position. In fact, the masses rarely raise problems that are impossible for the leadership to solve, and even if they do, we can explain them. I also thought that public criticism should be prepared. For example, the comrades of the newspaper once sent me an article criticizing the former head of the Anshan Electricity Bureau for review. At that time, although I agreed to publish it, I wanted the newspaper to publish it when the Municipal Committee sent someone to inspect the work, fearing that public criticism would put the "leadership in a passive position." Later, it was delayed for a long time, and as a result, the director was transferred, and the criticism draft was no longer suitable for publication. In fact, public criticism will not only not put the leadership in a passive position, but will also help the leadership to easily inspect the work and more quickly urge those who have made mistakes to correct their mistakes.
    "After public criticism, I am afraid that the criticized will make trouble and not solve the problem, so it is better to solve it ideologically internally." In the past, after the "Worker's Life" newspaper published criticism drafts, some of those criticized did not first consider how to review and correct errors or shortcomings, but looked for discrepancies in individual facts or words and used this as an excuse to complain to the Municipal Committee and make trouble. In fact, this is mostly due to the lack of firmness on the part of the Municipal Committee leadership, or the more or less sympathy for the discrepancies in individual words and facts pointed out by those criticized, which grew up. If the leadership unanimously and resolutely criticized their making trouble for only aggravating their mistakes, and strictly ordered them to make self-criticisms, otherwise they would be dealt with for violating Party discipline, then the situation would definitely be different. After the People's Daily's criticism this time, the Municipal Committee expressed its firm acceptance of the criticism, and no one criticized made trouble, and their attitude was relatively good. It can be seen that weak leadership, lacking combativeness and revolutionary spirit, can only make things worse.
    "Take care of the masses' influence." In reality, it is taking care of cadres more and taking care of critics and mass opinions less; it is better to criticize less and make the masses dissatisfied than to touch cadres or leaders. This is very wrong. The workers of some units criticized the cadres saying: "They dare not criticize superiors, they shield each other at the same level, and they deduct from subordinates." This should arouse our deep vigilance.
    "Too much criticism will create a bad impression on the masses." Because I had this confused idea, I limited the number of criticism drafts in the newspaper. Of course, our work achievements should be publicized. In fact, the masses have realized from their lives that the development of the revolutionary cause and the rise of the people's living standards will not create a bad impression just because they see the shortcomings in our work (even if there are more of them). On the contrary, if we dare to publicly criticize the shortcomings, the masses will feel that our requirements for the work are strict and that we are very responsible for the people's cause.
    My confused thoughts above are incompatible with the Party's principles of criticism and self-criticism.
    Fifth, lack of self-criticism and democratic style. After I sent the letter to the newspaper, the comrades of the newspaper raised objections; but I failed to humbly listen to the opinions of the comrades below, and did not even look at the Central Decision before hastily replying. I still believed that my letter did not contradict the Central Decision and insisted on my mistake. After more than a year, I have always adopted a bureaucratic attitude and have never been able to humbly listen to the opinions of other comrades and seriously study it, so that the error has not been corrected for a long time. In addition, many of the regulations I made in the letter regarding newspaper criticism should have been agreed upon by the Municipal Committee or a majority of the members first, but I only transferred them to the newspaper after obtaining the consent of individual members. If the Municipal Committee or the majority of the members had reviewed them, the errors in the letter could have been avoided.
    According to the above review, my mistake lies mainly in not truly realizing that criticism and self-criticism are one of the most important ways to overcome the internal contradictions of the people and the Party, and are the driving force for promoting our work, and that public criticism is "of even more prominent importance" at present. I lack a sufficient mass viewpoint and the idea of relying on the working class, and I do not trust them enough. I have failed to warmly welcome and support them in criticizing the shortcomings of our work straightforwardly, to give play to their enthusiasm in participating in enterprise management, so as to cultivate their ability to manage enterprises, enhance their sense of national ownership and work enthusiasm, and improve our work. I also lack self-criticism and a democratic style. In order to correct these mistakes, I am determined to strengthen the study of theory and policies in the future; strengthen the Party's organizational life, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and enhance Party spirit training; promote democracy, humbly listen to the opinions of comrades, especially consider opinions that are contrary to my own; deeply inspect work, and strengthen close ties with the masses.
    Anshan's production and construction are too important. I deeply feel the importance of the responsibility. In the future, I should be more humble and cautious, conscientious and meticulous, so that I will not make mistakes or make fewer mistakes. I believe that under the leadership of the higher Party committee and under the supervision of the Anshan Party organization and the masses, my mistakes can be corrected and will certainly be corrected. At present, the Anshan Municipal Committee is taking the development of criticism and self-criticism as a starting point to launch a struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and disciplines in the entire city of Anshan, in order to ensure the smooth completion of Anshan's huge economic construction tasks.

    我对限制报纸批评的检讨
    中共鞍山市委书记　韩天石
    我完全同意二月六日人民日报所载“鞍山‘工人生活’报在开展批评中遭遇到官僚主义者的严重阻碍”一文中对中共鞍山市委和我个人以及其他有关同志所作的批评。二月八日我们接到人民日报后，当即召开了市委会议，我并在会上作了检讨。市委又和“工人生活”报、市委纪律检查委员会和鞍山市人民政府监察部门的同志举行座谈，吸收了各方面的意见。市委一致认为：人民日报的批评是诚挚的、正确的，对鞍山全体干部和职工以及我个人的教育是十分深刻的。这个批评大大提高了群众的积极性，对改进鞍山市委和各机关的工作有着很大的推动作用。
    我对待批评与自我批评犯有原则性的错误。这个错误是严重的，它给党在政治上造成了很大的损失。我给“工人生活”报的两封信，就是我错误地对待批评与自我批评和违犯中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”（下简称中央决定）的具体表现。这个错误是我没有认真学习和深刻领会中央决定的必然结果。我除了诚恳地接受人民日报的批评外，并愿在工作中坚决地加以纠正。现将我在贯彻批评与自我批评和执行中央决定中所犯的错误检讨如下（关于其他方面的错误和缺点，当另行检讨）：
    第一、一九五○年四月十九日中央决定中指出：
    “吸引人民群众在报纸刊物上公开地批评我们工作中的缺点和错误，并教育党员、特别是党的干部在报纸刊物上作关于这些缺点和错误的自我批评，在今天是更加突出地重要起来了。”一九五一年我到鞍山仅一个月，并不了解鞍山执行中央决定的情况，即错误地认为“工人生活”报对我们工作中的错误和缺点的公开批评已“很不少”了。实际上不是
    “很不少”，而是很少；广大职工对这个情况是不满意的。譬如在历次群众运动中，职工群众对工作对领导都提出许多批评和意见，但这些意见很少在报刊上公开发表。群众认为“工人生活”报“不解渴”、“不敢批评”。但我没有认识事情的真实情况，当了抗拒批评和不愿公开批评的人底尾巴，违犯了中央决定；我没有听到广大群众的呼声，不是把公开批评看成“突出地重要起来”，而是想把公开批评收缩起来。
    中央决定中规定：“凡在报纸刊物上公布的批评，都由报纸刊物的记者和编辑负独立的责任。”“……只要报纸刊物确认这种批评在基本上是正确的，即令并未征求或并未征得被批评者的同意，仍然应当负责加以发表。”而我对报纸上的批评却作出许多限制。这就不能不影响报社同志在开展批评方面中的积极性，不能不影响他们向抗拒、压制、限制批评作斗争的勇气，使报社同志感到还是“少批评为妙”。也正如人民日报所指出：许多批评稿件送给被批评的单位和人员看，很少得到热情支持和拥护，有的甚至遭到被批评者的谩骂或打击。即或批评稿件登载了，有的已不及时，有的被删削得毫无生气。甚至在一九五二年一年中送给市委审阅的稿件有三件竟没有了下文。“工人生活”报上的批评稿件的件数也因此下降了。
    第二、我对公开批评不是采取热情的、支持的、为批评者造成有利条件的态度，不是像中央决定中所指出的：“因此党的各级领导机关和干部必须对于反映群众意见的批评采取热烈欢迎和坚决保护的革命态度，而反对对群众批评置之不理、限制发表和对批评者实行打击、报复与嘲笑的官僚主义态度。这在今天是主要的方面。”我不了解批评与自我批评是克服人民内部矛盾的斗争的一种主要形式，是新与旧的斗争，而新生力量的产生和发展会受到旧的力量的限制和反抗的。在今天开展公开批评不是很顺利，而是遭受着重重限制和抗拒。在鞍山绝不止于人民日报批评中所揭露的事实，如有的支部书记错误地规定向报社投稿要经支部审查，即是又一个例子。甚至有的同志认为“支部无权批评行政干部”，认为“批评知识分子要经支部批准”。有的认为给报纸写批评稿或向上级反映情况都是“无组织无纪律”。有的对批评者实行报复、找蹩扭、“穿小鞋”、讽刺挖苦。如有的厂长通知车间干部，不让供给记者材料，对他们嘲笑，谩骂，使许多勇于批评的记者、通讯员和职工受到限制和压制。但我在过去未能重视这方面的事实，有时看到也未引起义愤。
    在另一方面，广大群众对公开批评的态度却与此完全相反。他们是热烈欢迎和拥护开展公开批评的。如“工人生活”报在发表了比较重要的批评后，都收到读者表示拥护的来信；读者并对没有检讨或检讨不好者提出批评。特别是二月六日人民日报对鞍山的批评，群众更是热烈拥护。他们争相抢阅这天的人民日报，并自动展开讨论。当天“工人生活”报也收到很多读者来信表示拥护，并对阻碍批评者提出批评。群众对人民日报的批评反映极好，他们说：“只有共产党才能这样做”、“旧社会绝没有这事”、“共产党不怕批评，不怕暴露缺点”、“毛主席领导得好，太伟大了”。这种反映很多。这说明我们的党并没有因为公开的批评降低了威信，相反地大大提高了群众的积极性和党的威信。这种情况给我以极深刻的教育，使我愈加感到过去对批评与自我批评的认识错误，我不是以革命精神来热烈欢迎和支持批评，而是在旁边指责批评多了、“要慎重”，表现了一种官僚主义态度。我也更少采取组织上的措施对批评加以支持和保护，如一九五二年“工人生活”报发表二百八十二篇批评、建议稿件
    （批评和建议稿件有时很难分别，人民日报文中所指的一百零八篇仅为批评稿件之一部），就有九十九件未得到公开答复，而我又未对此采取组织上的措施，这样就损伤了群众进行批评的勇气和积极性，增加了他们向错误进行斗争的顾虑。当我们每次发动群众揭发不合理现象时，群众都有很多顾虑，这不能不是一个原因。
    我常常想着贯彻管理民主化，吸引与训练工人参加生产管理，但却没有把批评与自我批评看成是具体提高群众觉悟，加强群众主人翁感觉，吸引其参加企业管理和提高其管理才能，巩固和增强党与群众联系的重要方法；也没有把它看成是群众进行自我教育，和保守思想进行斗争的重要方式。我没有认识到只有使广大职工感到“能说话”、“说了能顶事”并参加到各种社会事业中，革命事业才能真正成为群众自己的事业。
    第三、鞍山党组织内的批评与自我批评是有的，但平时松，运动来时紧。我思想上就常常以党内批评来代替公开批评、来代替纪律。对沙友石、马成德等同志的错误，我是知道的。但我认为已在党内批评了，他们也检讨了，虽不深刻，但有进步，所以就不必再公开批评了。对申东黎同志的错误，我曾批评过，他承认了错误，我也就认为不必再公开批评了。而犯错误的同志，对党的批评虽然表示“接受”，但改正不够，对公开进行自我批评仍然认识不足。我没有认识到应让群众知道这些同志对错误的认识程度，来监督其改正；同时我也未能很好地运用报纸这个宣传和组织的强有力的武器来进行这一工作。其次，我对执行党的纪律也是不够严肃的，有些同志所犯的错误虽严重，但我认为他们作了检讨，就可以不必处分了，我片面地了解了“处理从宽”的一面。
    第四、我在批评与自我批评问题上所以犯错误，还由于存在着以下几种糊涂思想：
    “怕公开批评使领导陷于被动”。我过去认为群众公开批评某些实际上短时间很难解决的问题，会使领导陷于被动。事实上，群众是很少给领导上提出不可能解决的问题的，即或有，我们也是可以解释的。我还认为展开公开批评要有准备，如报社同志曾送我审查一篇批评前鞍山电业局长的文章，当时我虽同意登，但要报社在市委派人去检查工作时再登，怕公开批评后使“领导陷于被动”。以后拖了很久，结果这个局长调走了，批评稿件也就不好再登了。其实，公开批评不但不会使领导陷于被动，而且会帮助领导便于检查工作，会更迅速地促使犯错误者改正错误。
      “公开批评后，怕被批评者闹情绪，反而不解决问题，不如在内部从思想上解决。”过去“工人生活”报刊出批评的稿件后，有些被批评者不是首先考虑如何检讨和改正错误或缺点，而是寻找个别事实或词句的出入，以此为借口向市委告状，闹情绪。事实上，这多是由于市委领导方面不坚决，或多或少地同情被批评者所指出的个别词句和事实上的出入，而滋长起来的。如果领导方面一致地坚决地批评其闹情绪只有加重其错误，严令其检讨，否则以违反党的纪律论处，那末情况一定会是另外一个样子的。这次经人民日报批评后，市委表示坚决接受批评，而被批评者也无人闹情绪，态度都比较好。可见，软弱的、缺乏战斗性和革命精神的领导只能把事情弄坏。
      “照顾群众影响”。实际上是照顾干部多，而对批评者和对群众意见照顾少；宁肯少批评和让群众不满，也不要触动干部或领导者。这是十分错误的。有的单位的职工对干部批评说：“对上级不敢批评，对同级互相包庇，对下级扣”。这应引起我们深刻的警惕。
      “批评多了，会给群众造成坏印象”。由于我有这种糊涂想法，因而限制了报纸批评稿件的数量。我们的工作成绩当然应该宣传，事实上，群众从他们的生活中已认识到革命事业的发展和人民生活水平的上升，是不会因为见到我们工作中的缺点（即或多些）就造成不良印象的。相反地，我们敢于对缺点进行公开批评，群众反会感到我们对工作的要求是严格的，对人民事业是十分负责的。
    以上我的这些糊涂思想，都是与党的批评与自我批评的原则不相容的。
    第五、缺乏自我批评精神和民主作风。我给报社去信以后，报社同志曾提出反对的意见；但我未能虚心地听取下面同志的意见，甚至没有看一下中央决定，即草率地回信。我仍然认为自己的信与中央决定没有抵触，坚持了自己的错误。事情隔了一年多之久，我一直采取官僚主义态度，从未能虚心地听取其他同志的意见，认真地研究一下，因而使错误长期未能得到改正。另外，我在信中对报纸批评所作的许多规定，是应该先经市委会或多数委员同意的，但我仅仅经过了个别委员的同意即转给报社了。如果经过市委会或大多数委员审查，信中的错误是可以避免的。
    根据上面的检查，我的错误主要在于没有真正认识到：批评与自我批评是克服人民的和党的内部矛盾的最主要的方式之一，是推动我们工作前进的动力，而公开批评在目前“更加突出地重要起来”。我缺乏充分的群众观点和依靠工人阶级的思想，对他们信赖不够，未能热烈欢迎和支持他们直截了当地批评我们工作的缺点，发挥他们参加企业管理的积极性，以培养他们管理企业的才能，提高其国家主人翁感和工作积极性，来改进我们的工作。我也缺乏自我批评精神和民主作风。为纠正这些错误，今后我决心加强理论政策学习；加强党的组织生活，开展批评与自我批评，增强党性锻炼；发扬民主，虚心听取同志们的意见，特别要考虑与自己意见相反的意见；深入检查工作，加强与群众的密切联系。
    鞍山的生产和建设事业太重要了。我深感责任的重大。今后我更应十分虚心谨慎，兢兢业业，使自己不再犯错误或少犯错误。我相信在上级党的领导下，在鞍山党组织和群众的监督下，我的错误是可以改正，而且一定会改正的。目前鞍山市委正以开展批评与自我批评为起点，在鞍山全市展开反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争，以保证鞍山巨大经济建设任务的顺利完成。
