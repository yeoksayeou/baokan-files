    Self-Criticism Regarding Blindly Promoting Flue-Cured Tobacco
    Hebei Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry

    We fully agree with the People's Daily's criticism on February 6th regarding the Hebei Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry's blindly mobilizing farmers to plant large quantities of tobacco, causing serious losses to the state and the people. Our blind mobilization of the masses to expand tobacco planting area, the high cost and low quality of flue-cured tobacco, and the inability to sell it in a timely manner have caused serious losses to the state and the people, and greatly affected the prestige of the People's Government. The occurrence of this error indicates that the leading cadres of our Department of Agriculture and Forestry have serious bureaucratic work styles.

    Why did the error of blindly promoting flue-cured tobacco occur? First of all, it is because we lacked an overall perspective, did not strictly adhere to the national production plan, and did not abide by the principle of "production based on sales," but one-sidedly hoped to increase the income of the farmers. In 1951, in order to solve the difficulties in the lives of people in mountainous areas, believing that planting cash crops could increase farmers' income, we selected four counties, Yixian, Huairou, Fuping, and Miyun, to promote 15,000 mu of flue-cured tobacco. According to tobacco farmers' calculations, the income was one-third higher than planting general food crops. We did not learn from the lesson of 1951, when the China Native Produce Company lost 3.3 billion yuan in purchasing flue-cured tobacco due to its low quality and high cost. Thus, in 1952, we promoted 42,000 mu of flue-cured tobacco in seven counties: Xingtang, Quyang, Laishui, Sanhe, Jixian, Changping, and Pinggu. However, we did not actively seek solutions to the problems that needed to be addressed after the expansion of production. On July 5th of last year, we received a notice from the North China Administrative Committee forwarded from the China Native Produce Company suggesting that we reduce the tobacco field area. By then, the tobacco fields had already been transplanted and the seedlings were set, and the error had already been made.

    Secondly, after the error of blindly planting tobacco had already been made, we did not strengthen technical guidance to tobacco farmers with a serious and responsible attitude to ensure that the quality of flue-cured tobacco met the standards required by the state. Although the quality of flue-cured tobacco in 1952 was higher than in 1951, the problem of grading flue-cured tobacco was not resolved, and therefore it did not meet export standards, which greatly affected sales. At the same time, in our work, we only paid attention to seedling cultivation, transplanting, building tobacco drying barns, and training tobacco technicians, but not enough attention was paid to major issues such as promoting advanced experience, improving yield per unit area, and reducing costs. Therefore, the investment in flue-cured tobacco was large and the cost was high, and the masses suffered even greater losses after the tobacco price decreased.

    Thirdly, we lacked the spirit of being responsible for the masses to the end. We did not actively conduct investigations and research on the issue of tobacco sales, clarify the key to the problem, and resolve it. We adopted a bureaucratic and liberal attitude towards letters from the masses. Especially after serious difficulties occurred in sales, our thinking was once confused, and we erroneously dismissed some tobacco workers and did not plan to continue planting. We shifted from blindly advocating to abandoning leadership, disregarding the large amount of capital invested by tobacco farmers due to tobacco planting. Instead of correcting the error with a positive attitude and implementing planned planting to compensate for the losses caused by blind planting.

    In order to correct the error and reduce the losses of the masses, we are organizing forces, in conjunction with relevant departments, under the leadership of the Provincial Finance and Economics Committee, to resolve the purchase problem, adhering to the principle of giving priority to supplying local tobacco factories with tobacco leaves produced within the province, carrying out purchases on schedule, and implementing a fair and reasonable price policy. In order to overcome bureaucracy, improve leadership style, and strengthen ties with industrial departments and purchasing departments, under the leadership of the Provincial Finance and Economics Committee, and according to the requirements of higher authorities, we are now formulating the 1953 production plan and organizing working groups to go deep into the countryside to continue thoroughly examining our leadership's bureaucratic errors, and thoroughly changing the ideological work style of engaging in things blindly and not caring about the sufferings of the masses.

    关于盲目推广烤烟的检讨
    河北省人民政府农林厅
    二月六日人民日报关于河北省人民政府农林厅盲目发动农民大量种烟，造成国家和人民的严重损失的批评，我们完全同意。我们盲目发动群众扩大种烟面积，烤烟成本高，质量低，不能及时售出，这就给国家和人民造成了严重的损失，使人民政府的威信受到极大的影响。这一错误的发生，说明了我们农林厅的领导干部存在着严重的官僚主义作风。
    为什么会产生盲目推广烤烟的错误呢？这首先是因为我们缺乏整体观念，没有严格地服从国家生产计划，没有遵守以销定产的原则，而片面地希望增加农民群众的收入。一九五一年，为了解决山区人民生活困难，认为种植经济作物可以增加农民收入，便选择易县、怀柔、阜平、密云等四个县，推广烤烟一万五千亩。经烟农计算收益，比种一般粮食作物多收入三分之一。我们没有接受一九五一年由于烤烟质量低、成本高以致中国土产公司在收购烤烟时亏损三十三亿元的教训，就在一九五二年在行唐、曲阳、涞水、三河、蓟县、昌平、平谷七个县推广烤烟四万二千亩。但对扩大生产后所需要解决的问题，我们却没有积极地设法加以解决。去年七月五日接到华北行政委员会转来中国土产公司建议缩小烟田面积的通知，当时烟田已经移栽定苗，错误已经形成了。
    其次是在盲目种烟的错误已经形成以后，没有以认真负责的态度，对烟农加强技术指导，使烤烟质量达到国家要求的规格。一九五二年烤烟的质量虽比一九五一年为高，但烤烟分级问题没有解决，因之不合出口标准，这就大大影响了销路。同时在工作上，我们只注意了育苗移栽、盖烤烟房、训练烤烟技术人员，对推广先进经验，提高单位面积产量，降低成本等主要问题注意不够，因此，烤烟投资大、成本高，在烟价降低后，群众受到更大损失。
    第三、我们缺乏对群众负责到底的精神。对烤烟销路问题，没有积极进行调查研究，弄清问题的关键，加以解决。对群众来信采取了官僚主义、自由主义的态度。特别是在销路发生严重困难以后，思想上曾一度混乱，错误地解雇了一部分烤烟工人，不打算再种下去。由盲目提倡转为放弃领导，对烟农因种烟所投入的大量资金置于不顾，不是以积极的态度纠正错误，实行计划种植，以弥补因盲目种植所造成的损失。
    为了改正错误，减小群众损失，我们正组织力量，结合有关部门，在省财政经济委员会的领导下，解决收购问题，本着省内生产烟叶尽量供给省内烟厂需用的原则，按期进行收购，并贯彻公平合理的价格政策。为了克服官僚主义，改进领导作风，密切与工业部门、收购部门的联系，在省财政经济委员会领导下，根据上级的要求，现在正在制定一九五三年生产计划，并组织工作组深入农村，继续深入检查我们领导方面的官僚主义错误，彻底改变盲目从事及不关心群众疾苦的思想作风。
