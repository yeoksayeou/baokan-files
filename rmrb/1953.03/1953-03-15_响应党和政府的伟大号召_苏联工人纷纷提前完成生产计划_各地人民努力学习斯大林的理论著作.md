(Xinhua News Agency, March 14th) According to TASS news: The working people of the Soviet Union, responding to the call of the great Stalin's loyal comrades-in-arms Malenkov, Beria, and Molotov, are transforming grief into strength and redoubling their efforts in communist construction.

	In Moscow, the entire staff of the "Hammer and Sickle" Steel Plant is gloriously fulfilling the production guarantee they put forward at Stalin's memorial service, to overproduce four thousand tons of steel and three thousand tons of rolled metal this year. In recent days, rapid steelmaking in the open-hearth furnace workshop has greatly increased. Steelworkers such as Yerobkin and Gusarov have reduced the steelmaking time per furnace by one hour and overproduced a large amount of steel beyond the plan. In the transformer factory, which guarantees to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule, Stakhanovite workers in the assembly workshop are completing two or three times their work quotas. On March 11, the workers of this factory completed the winding work of powerful transformers twenty days ahead of schedule. At the Ilyich Factory, which manufactures electrical equipment for the great communist construction projects, Stakhanovite work teams have been organized in all departments. Dozens of turners, foundry workers, and assemblers have greatly exceeded their quotas. High-speed turner Alkharov completes more than two quotas every day, and the Yagayev team, which forges motor parts, regularly completes three times the quota. In the textile industry, the Red Hill Textile Factory has also overproduced seven thousand meters of textiles beyond the plan in recent days.

	In Stalingrad, the giant conveying device of the Stalingrad Tractor Factory is constantly outputting powerful crawler tractors. Factory foreman and Stalin Prize winner Belousov over-casted two hundred and fifty more parts than planned on March 10. On the same day, molding machine operator Borodin did almost twice the quota of work in one shift. Young worker M. Shepetnov also overproduced six hundred and fifty parts beyond the plan.

	In Tbilisi, the capital of the Georgian Republic, the workers of the Kirov Machine Tool Factory accomplished far more work on the morning of March 10 than the target for the first ten days of March. Before leaving work, they also overproduced a powerful pipe cutting machine. Advanced workers Manvelidze, Arjevanidze, and others also set an example of heroic labor. They all completed three production quotas on the eleventh.

	News of responding to the call of the Party Central Committee and the government with concrete actions and labor achievements continues to pour in from all directions. In Kuznetsk, the coal miners of Chernaya Gora, who had guaranteed to overproduce 10,000 tons of coal by the end of the year, have now decided to complete their guarantee before May Day. This amazing initiative has been enthusiastically supported by the coal miners in the Kuznetsk coal area. In Siberia, a vigorous movement to tow heavy-load trains is unfolding on the Tomsk Railway. The staff completed much more work in the first ten days of March than the prescribed passenger and freight transport plan. Drivers at the Taiga Station, Solovyan Station, Malyuchkov Station, and Khakhlen Station towed trains that were 50 percent heavier than usual while maintaining the prescribed speed standards. In Minsk, the capital of the Belorussian Republic, the workers of the Minsk Automobile Factory guarantee to complete the annual plan for total output and vehicles for sale ahead of schedule, and guarantee to save 25 kilograms of metal for each vehicle, thus saving the state at least 7.5 million rubles. Hundreds of workers have participated in Stakhanovite work teams in memory of Stalin, and they have also greatly exceeded their quotas. Currently, Minsk-produced automatic dump trucks are continuously being transported by train to the construction sites of the great Stalin communist construction projects.

(Xinhua News Agency, March 13th) TASS Moscow: The Soviet people are diligently studying J.V. Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR." Tens of thousands of study groups and classroom discussions have been organized in all enterprises and collective farms in Moscow, Leningrad, Tashkent, Tbilisi, and other cities to study Stalin's work. Similar study organizations have also been organized in the Soviet army and in the railway and inland waterway transport industries. Actors and directors of Moscow theaters have held regular theoretical conferences to discuss this magnificent work. Lectures and reports are being held across the country to explain this historically significant masterpiece. More than eight thousand lectures have been held in Moscow this year. More than two hundred and eighty-seven thousand lectures and reports on this work have recently been held in various parts of Ukraine. The scientific workers of the Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences alone—Doctors and Masters of Economics—have given more than three hundred reports across the country recently. The topics of the speakers were: "J.V. Stalin's work 'Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR'—A New Outstanding Contribution to Marxist-Leninist Doctrine", "J.V. Stalin's Elaboration and Concretization of the Basic Economic Law of Socialism", "J.V. Stalin on the Main Prerequisites for the Transition from Socialism to Communism", etc.

    响应党和政府的伟大号召
    苏联工人纷纷提前完成生产计划
    各地人民努力学习斯大林的理论著作
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联各地劳动人民响应伟大斯大林的忠实战友马林科夫、贝利亚和莫洛托夫的号召，化悲痛为力量，加倍努力从事共产主义建设。
    在莫斯科，“锤子与镰刀”钢铁厂的全体职工正在光荣地完成他们在斯大林追悼会上提出的生产保证，要在今年超额生产四千吨钢和三千吨压延金属。最近几天来，平炉工场的快速炼钢已大大增加。叶罗布金、古沙罗夫等炼钢工人已把每炉炼钢时间缩短了一小时，超计划生产了大批的钢。在保证提前完成今年计划的变压器工厂里，装配车间的斯塔哈诺夫式工作者正在两倍或三倍地完成工作定额。在三月十一日，这个工厂的工人们提前二十天完成了效力强大的变压器的缠线工作。在为伟大的共产主义建设工程制造电气设备的伊里奇工厂，各部门都组织了斯塔哈诺夫式工作班。几十个镟工、翻砂工人、装配工人都大大地超过了定额。高速镟工阿尔哈罗夫每天完成两个定额以上，锻制电动机零件的亚盖耶夫小组经常完成三倍定额。在纺织工业方面，红岗纺织厂在最近几天中也超计划生产了七千公尺纺织品。
    在斯大林格勒，斯大林格勒拖拉机制造厂的巨大输送装置，正不断地输出效能强大的履带拖拉机。工厂领班、斯大林奖金得奖人别洛乌索夫在三月十日超过计划多铸造了二百五十个零件。同日，压型器操使者鲍罗金在一个工作班的时间内所做的工作，几乎是定额的两倍。青年工人米·谢佩特诺夫也超计划多生产了六百五十个零件。
    在格鲁吉亚共和国首都第比利斯，基洛夫工作母机制造厂的工人在三月十日早晨所做的工作，大大地超过了三月份头十天的目标。他们在下班以前还超计划生产了一架效能强大的截管机。先进工人曼维利泽、阿尔杰瓦尼泽等人也树立了英雄劳动的榜样。他们在十一日那一天都完成了三个生产定额。
    以具体行动和劳动成就响应党中央和政府号召的消息还源源不断地从四面八方传来。在库兹涅茨克，曾保证在年底以前超额生产一万吨煤的切尔纳亚哥拉的采煤工人，现在已决定要在五一劳动节以前就完成他们的保证。这个惊人的倡议已得到了库兹涅茨克煤区采煤工人的热烈支持。在西伯利亚，托木斯克铁路上正在生气蓬勃地展开牵引载重列车的运动。工作人员在三月头十天内所作的工作，已大大地超过了规定的客货运送计划。塔伊加车站、索洛维安车站、马柳奇科夫车站、哈赫连车站的司机们，按班牵引了比平常重百分之五十的列车，同时还保持着规定的速度标准。在白俄罗斯共和国首都明斯克，明斯克汽车工厂的工人们保证提前完成总产量和供销售用的车辆的全年计划，保证每一辆汽车节省二十五公斤的金属，这样，至少可节省国家经费七百五十万卢布。数以百计的工人已参加了纪念斯大林的斯塔哈诺夫式工作班，他们所做的工作也大大地超过了定额。目前明斯克出产的自动卸货车辆正接连不断地由火车运往伟大的斯大林共产主义建设工程工地去。
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联人民努力学习约·维·斯大林的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”。在莫斯科、列宁格勒、塔什干、第比利斯和其他城市的所有企业以及各集体农庄里，已经组织了成千成万的学习小组和课堂讨论，学习斯大林的这一著作。在苏联军队里，以及在铁路和内河航运业方面，也组织了同样的学习组织。莫斯科各剧院的演员和导演已定期举行理论会议，讨论这一辉煌的著作。全国各地都在举行讲演会和报告会，讲解这一部具有历史意义的巨著。今年在莫斯科举行的讲演会，已有八千多次。乌克兰各地最近已举行了二十八万七千多次关于这一著作的演讲和报告。单是最近苏联科学院经济研究所的科学工作者——经济学博士和硕士在全国各地举行的报告会就有三百多次。讲演者所讲的题目是：“约·维·斯大林的著作‘苏联社会主义经济问题’对马克思列宁主义学说的新的卓越贡献”、“约·维·斯大林对社会主义基本经济法则的发挥与具体化”、“约·维·斯大林论从社会主义过渡到共产主义的主要先决条件”等等。
