    The Central Light Industry Ministry Reviews and Compiles This Year's Production Plan
    Implement the Policy of Improving Product Quality and Reducing Costs
    The Central People's Government's Ministry of Light Industry, in reviewing and compiling the 1953 production plan, implemented the policy of improving product quality and reducing costs.
    In the process of formulating the plan, leading cadres of some factories under the ministry exposed various conservative ideas. Some believed that "to improve product quality, costs cannot be reduced," and adopted the method of increasing production costs to improve product quality. For example, in order to reverse the poor product quality situation in 1952, the Northeast Rubber Factory No. 2 excessively increased the grade of raw materials and consumption quotas. Some tire inner tubes could meet the standards with No. 2 raw rubber, but the factory insisted on using No. 1 raw rubber. According to the results of the trial production in Shanghai by the tire specification group of the Central Light Industry Ministry, tire outer tires only need 70% to 80% of hard carbon black to meet the bureau's standards, but they insisted on using 100% of hard carbon black. Some senior technicians of the Rubber Industry Administration also defended this backward quota, saying: "The trial production standard is unreliable." "Such a standard is the country's plan when it is living a poor life." If the plan were compiled according to their standards, the cost of hard carbon black alone would increase significantly. Another manifestation of conservative thinking is adhering to conventions and failing to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Soviet experts suggested to us long ago that the 34×7 tire cord fabric can be changed from twelve layers to ten layers. With our existing technical conditions, this is achievable. The trial production result of Qingdao Rubber Factory No. 1 in November last year proved that implementing this advanced experience can not only reduce costs, but also improve tire quality. However, when formulating the 1953 plan, Northeast Rubber Factory No. 1 still formulated it according to the standard of twelve layers. This conservative thinking is also manifested in blindly emphasizing difficulties and underestimating the strength of the workers. For example, in the past, paper mills in the Northeast achieved great results by using iron sulfide instead of sulfur, but when compiling the 1953 plan, seeing that the supply of iron sulfide was somewhat difficult, they wanted to change part of the iron sulfide to sulfur. In fact, the difficulty in the supply of iron sulfide can be overcome. Furthermore, the production tasks of the rubber industry in 1953 basically did not increase, but the rubber factories proposed to increase the number of employees by 28.8%.
    In reviewing and compiling the plan, the Ministry of Light Industry criticized the above-mentioned erroneous ideas and adhered to the policy of improving quality and reducing costs. After the cost plans of various paper mills were reviewed and compiled, merely making reasonable adjustments to the chemical wood pulp ratio composition and changing sulfur to iron sulfide could save the country tens of billions of yuan in funds. The cost plans compiled by the factories under the Rubber Industry Administration were originally 2.18% higher than last year. After accounting, under the condition that the quality of rubber raw materials and consumption quotas were appropriately increased compared with last year, the planned cost was still lower than last year, and the cost plans of some enterprises were reduced by about 10% compared with last year.
    Through this review and compilation of the plan, many shortcomings in the management of the factories under the Ministry of Light Industry were also exposed: First, quota management is very poor, and there is a lack of correct records. For example, the wood consumption quota of the paper pulp of Northeast Paper Mill No. 1 and No. 2 was estimated based on the size of the purchased wood. In the past, the forestry department's scaling method was wider, and the raw wood consumption quota was lower; this year, the forestry department's scaling method is stricter, and the consumption quota has increased. Light industrial factories in other regions have no quotas at all; when compiling the plan, they are temporarily estimated based on experience. Second, cost accounting is very chaotic. Xuchang Re-baking Factory and Beijing Metrology Factory cannot even calculate the unit cost in 1952. The production cost budget and production cost plan of many factories are pieced together randomly, and there are many contradictions. Third, most factories have no quality standards, nor do they have strict and feasible technical operating procedures and technical management systems.

### 中央轻工业部审编今年生产计划  贯彻提高产品质量降低成本的方针

    中央轻工业部审编今年生产计划
    贯彻提高产品质量降低成本的方针
    中央人民政府轻工业部在审编一九五三年生产计划中，贯彻了提高产品质量、降低成本的方针。
    在编制计划过程中，该部所属部分工厂的领导干部暴露出了各种保守思想。有的认为“要提高产品质量，便不能降低成本”，采取了增加生产成本的办法来提高产品质量。如东北橡胶二厂为扭转一九五二年产品质量低劣的情况，竟过分地提高了原材料的等级和消耗定额。有些轮胎内胎，用二号生胶质量就可以合格，但该厂却要用一号生胶。根据中央轻工业部轮胎规格小组在上海试制的结果，轮胎外胎只要用百分之七十至八十的硬炭黑就可以达到局定标准，但他们却要用百分之百的硬炭黑。橡胶工业管理局部分高级技术人员也为这落后的定额辩护说：“试制的标准不可靠。”“这样的标准是国家在过穷日子时的打算。”如果按照他们的标准编制计划，仅硬炭黑一项就要提高成本很多。保守思想的另一表现，是墨守陈规，不学习苏联先进经验。苏联专家早就向我们建议：34×7轮胎帘布可以由十二层改为十层。就我国现有的技术条件，这是可以办到的。青岛橡胶一厂去年十一月试制结果，证明执行这个先进经验不仅可以降低成本，而可以提高轮胎质量。但是东北橡胶一厂在订一九五三年计划时，却仍按十二层的标准制订。这种保守思想还表现为一味强调困难和对职工群众的力量估计不足。如东北各造纸厂过去用硫化铁代替硫磺，曾获很大成绩，但在编制一九五三年计划时，看到硫化铁供应有些困难，就想把部分硫化铁改为用硫磺。实际上硫化铁供应上的困难是可以克服的。再如一九五三年橡胶工业的生产任务基本上没有增加，但各橡胶厂却提出要增加职工百分之二十八点八。
    轻工业部在审编计划中，批判了上述种种错误思想，坚持了提高质量、降低成本的方针。各造纸厂的成本计划经过审编后，仅将化学木浆配比成份作合理调整，硫磺改用硫化铁等，就可为国家节约资金几百亿元。橡胶工业管理局所属各厂编订的成本计划，原来比去年提高百分之二点一八，经过核算，在橡胶原材料质量和消耗定额较去年适当提高的情况下，计划成本仍较去年为低，有些企业的成本计划竟较去年降低了百分之十左右。
    通过此次审编计划，同时暴露了轻工业部所属各厂经营管理上的许多缺点：一、定额管理很差，缺乏正确的纪录。如东北造纸一、二厂的造纸木浆原木消耗定额，是凭买进的木材尺寸多少推算的。过去林业部门检尺的方法较宽，原木消耗定额就低；今年林业部门检尺方法严格些，消耗定额就提高了。其他地区的轻工业工厂，根本没有定额；编制计划时，是临时凭经验估计的。二、成本计算很混乱。许昌复烤厂和北京度量衡厂连一九五二年的单位成本都算不出来。有不少厂的生产费预算表和生产成本计划是乱凑的，矛盾百出。三、大部分工厂没有质量标准，也没有严格的切实可行的技术操作规程和技术管理制度。
