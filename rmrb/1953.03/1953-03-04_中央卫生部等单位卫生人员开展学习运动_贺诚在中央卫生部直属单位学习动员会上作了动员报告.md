The study movement for health workers in the Central People's Government Ministry of Health and its directly affiliated units began on February 19th. The study period is scheduled for four weeks. The purpose is to implement the spirit of the Second National Health Administration Conference and the Second National Health Conference, especially the principle of "combining health work with mass movements." At the same time, the movement will conduct work inspections, launch a struggle against bureaucracy, focus on exposing and criticizing the bureaucracy of health leading organs and leaders, correct ideological styles, and find ways to improve work. The aim is to strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the health sector and better ensure the completion of the country's large-scale construction tasks.

In order to ensure that the study of health personnel throughout the country achieves the desired results, the Central People's Government Ministry of Health has decided to adopt the method of closely integrating with work, conducting in-depth, detailed, and specific analysis, solving ideological problems, and solving key problems. First, the leading organs and leading cadres will conduct inspections, starting with the Ministry of Health headquarters and key units directly under it, and then extending to general organs. In major administrative regions, units above the level of provincial and municipal people's government health departments and bureaus will proceed first, and then extend to health institutions in counties and districts. The focus will be on health administrative leaders, requiring Communist Party leading cadres to conduct inspections first. During the study process, problems will be raised and solved simultaneously. In hospitals, the focus will be on inspecting and improving work systems, styles, and improving technical management. First, the administrative leaders of hospitals will inspect their leadership styles, and then guide health technicians to carefully inspect their work. Health technicians should focus on self-awareness during inspections, fully assess the progress and achievements of health technicians, commend those with achievements, and seriously criticize those with mistakes.

On the 19th, the Central People's Government Ministry of Health convened a study mobilization meeting for directly affiliated units, where He Cheng, Deputy Minister of the Central People's Government Ministry of Health, delivered a mobilization report. On the 26th, Xu Yunbei, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Health, delivered a supplementary mobilization report. Currently, staff members of the Central Ministry of Health and its directly affiliated units are universally studying documents. (Xinhua News Agency)

Xinhua News Agency: He Cheng, Deputy Minister of the Central People's Government Ministry of Health, delivered a mobilization report at the study mobilization meeting for units directly under the Central Ministry of Health on the 19th. Deputy Minister He Cheng pointed out in his report that over the past three years, health departments at all levels and health workers have done a lot of work and achieved great results, which is a good aspect. However, at the same time, there is also a bad aspect, which is that there is a fairly serious phenomenon of bureaucracy, commandism, and violation of laws and regulations in health work. Since medical and health work is directly related to the lives and health of the people, the consequences caused by bureaucracy, commandism, and violation of laws and regulations are very serious. The phenomena of bureaucracy, commandism, and violation of laws and regulations in the health sector are primarily manifested in the weak political and ideological leadership of the Central Ministry of Health, the failure to strive for the implementation of the principles that have been put forward, and the lack of in-depth mobilization and organization after the formulation of guidelines and work plans, with plans often remaining at the level of general appeals. For the past three years, there has been an overemphasis on sitting in offices issuing orders, with little understanding of the situation at the lower levels; there are many work arrangements, but few inspections, and a lack of specific leadership, supervision, and inspection of the work that has been arranged. At the same time, work arrangements only explain tasks without clarifying specific methods, and there is insufficient investigation, research, and summarization of experience. The three principles of "prevention first, serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and uniting traditional Chinese and Western medicine" were formulated at the First National Health Conference in 1950, but some places did not implement them well after the conference, and some places did not even implement them at all. Even now, medical and health work among workers is very poor, and service to soldiers and farmers is also insufficient. Some district health centers do not know how to implement the principle of prevention first, mechanically stipulating "half-day health care, half-day treatment," resulting in nothing to do for half-day health care, and then changing to full-day outpatient service. After the issuance of instructions to rectify hospitals across the country in November 1950, only 23% of the country's general hospitals have implemented them due to a lack of supervision and inspection. In terms of health work in factories and mines, the Central Ministry of Health cooperated with the Central Ministry of Labor and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to conduct surveys of over a thousand factories and mines, but after the surveys, there was no good research and solution to the problems. The advanced experiences in health work have not been seriously studied and organized for promotion. Second, there is formalism and a purely task-oriented viewpoint, with people being busy with affairs all day long. On a national scale, 460 million vaccinations have been carried out in the past three years, which is a great achievement. However, the problem is that only tasks are given, without specific guidance on how to complete these tasks, so that some places repeat vaccinations for the masses in order to complete the tasks. In terms of rat catching, some places only arrange how many rats each person should catch, without explaining why they should be caught and how they should be caught. In the Seventh District of Tuerquan County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the masses only caught mountain rats to hand in for the task because it was difficult to catch domestic rats, and did not catch domestic rats at all. Some places stipulated that handing in rat tails would fulfill the task, and the masses cut off the rat tails and then released the rats. Third, administrative leaders of medical institutions violate laws and regulations and suppress democracy. The Ji Kaifu incident in Hankou and the Dou Duanxiao incident in Yunnan have already been announced. In 1951, the Subai Sanatorium also had an incident in which the leader forced the disabled soldier Fang Taibin to be discharged from the hospital based on temporary anger. Many medical and health institutions do not pay enough attention to letters and criticisms from the people. The Yangsi District Health Center in Shanghai has problems in its work; the physician Lu Yunbo from Aiwen Town made suggestions and sent them to the Liberation Daily. Gao Yu, the director of the health center, found out about it and used the excuse of convening a "Western Medicine Physician Epidemic Prevention Research Conference" to counter Lu Yunbo. Fourth, completing tasks by means of coercion and command. For example, during vaccinations, some places do not patiently publicize and explain to the masses to make them consciously and voluntarily accept the vaccination, but instead convene the masses under the guise of meetings, and then close the doors to force vaccinations, or cooperate with public security personnel to force passing masses to be vaccinated at the city gates. In the Tong County area of Hebei Province, there have been incidents of farmers "evading vaccination." Vaccination was originally a good thing, but due to coercion and command, the good thing was turned into a bad thing. Deputy Minister He Cheng emphasized that in this study, we must boldly expose bureaucracy, because it has become a stumbling block to further develop health work. After bureaucracy is overcome, the problems of coercion and command and violation of laws and regulations can also be overcome. In this study, leading cadres at all levels are required to deeply understand the spirit of the Second National Health Conference, bravely take the lead in exposing shortcomings in their work, and earnestly carry out criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism. The report concluded by pointing out that after this study movement, all health work units should formulate accurate work plans, and in the process of implementing the plans, they must organize forces to regularly check the implementation and solve problems in a timely manner.

    中央卫生部等单位卫生人员开展学习运动
    贺诚在中央卫生部直属单位学习动员会上作了动员报告
    中央人民政府卫生部及其各直属单位的卫生工作人员学习运动已在二月十九日开始。学习的时间预定为四个星期，目的是贯彻第二届全国卫生行政会议及第二届全国卫生会议的精神，特别是贯彻“卫生工作与群众运动相结合”的原则，同时通过检查工作，开展反对官僚主义的斗争，着重揭发和批判卫生领导机关和领导干部的官僚主义，端正思想作风，找出改进工作的办法，以求加强卫生部门的政治思想领导，更好地保证国家大规模建设任务的完成。
    中央人民政府卫生部为了使全国卫生人员的学习能收到预期的效果，决定采取紧紧结合工作，深入细致具体分析，解决思想问题、解决重点问题的办法来进行。首先是领导机关和领导干部进行检查，由中央卫生部本部和直属单位中的重点单位开始，再推及到一般机关；各大行政区就由省市人民政府卫生厅、局以上的单位先进行，再推行到县区的卫生机构。重点放在卫生行政领导人员，要求共产党员的领导干部首先作检查。学习过程中，一面提出问题一面解决问题。在医院中以检查改善工作制度、作风，和改善技术管理为重点，首先医院的行政领导干部检查领导作风，然后引导卫生技术人员认真地检查工作。卫生技术人员检查时要着重自觉，要充分估计卫生技术人员的进步与成绩，对有成绩的要进行表扬，对有错误的要进行严肃的批判。
    十九日中央人民政府卫生部召开了直属单位的学习动员会，中央人民政府卫生部副部长贺诚在会上作了动员报告。二十六日，卫生部副部长徐运北又作了补充动员报告。现中央卫生部及其直属单位的工作人员正在普遍学习文件。（新华社）
    中央人民政府卫生部副部长贺诚十九日在中央卫生部直属单位学习动员会上作了动员报告。贺诚副部长在报告中指出：三年来各级卫生部门和卫生工作人员作了很多工作，有了很大成绩，这是好的一面。但同时也有不好的一面，那就是卫生工作中普遍存在着相当严重的官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的现象。由于医务卫生工作直接关系到人民的生命和健康，因此官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪所引起的后果，是很严重的。卫生部门的官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的现象，首先表现在中央卫生部政治思想领导薄弱，对已经提出的原则没有力求贯彻，制订了方针和工作计划后，缺乏深入动员与组织工作，计划往往停留在一般号召上。三年来偏重于坐在房子里发号施令，不大了解下情；工作布置多，检查少，对已布置的工作缺乏具体领导和督促检查，同时布置工作只交代任务未讲清具体方法，调查研究和总结经验也很不够。一九五○年第一届全国卫生会议上制订了“预防为主，面向工农兵，团结中西医”三项原则，但会后有些地方没有很好执行，有的地方甚至没有执行。直到现在，在工人中的医药卫生工作做得很差，为兵为农民服务也做得不够。有的区卫生所不知道如何贯彻预防为主的原则，机械地规定“半日保健、半日治疗”，结果半日保健无事可作，又改为全日门诊。一九五○年十一月发出整顿全国医院的指示后，也由于缺乏督促和检查，至今执行的仅占全国综合医院的百分之二十三。在工厂矿山卫生工作方面，中央卫生部曾配合中央劳动部和中华全国总工会进行了千余个工厂矿山的调查工作，但调查以后没有很好地进行研究并解决问题。卫生工作中的先进经验也没有认真研究并组织推广。第二，形式主义和单纯任务观点，终日忙于事务。全国范围内三年来种痘四亿六千万人次，成绩很大。但毛病是只给任务，缺乏如何完成这一任务的具体指导工作，以致有的地方为了完成任务就给群众重复种痘。在捕鼠方面，有的地方也是只布置每人捕多少鼠，而不讲明为什么要捕、如何捕？内蒙古自治区突泉县七区群众因为家鼠难捕，就只捕山鼠交任务，对家鼠反而不捕。有的地方规定了交老鼠尾巴顶任务，群众把老鼠尾巴剪下后又放走了老鼠。第三，医疗机构的行政领导人员违法乱纪、压制民主。已经公布的有汉口纪凯夫事件和云南窦端孝事件。一九五一年苏北疗养院也发生过领导人凭一时意气，强迫残废军人房台彬出院的事件。很多医疗卫生机构对于人民来信和批评不够重视。上海杨思区卫生事务所工作上有问题；艾坟镇的医师陆云波提了意见寄到解放日报，该所所长高宇一知道后就以召开“西医师防疫研究会”为名，来反击陆云波。第四，以强迫命令的办法来完成任务。如预防注射时，有的地方不是耐心地向群众宣传解释，使他们自觉自愿地接受注射，而是假借开会为名召集群众，然后关起门来强迫注射，或与公安人员配合起来在城门口强迫过路群众注射。河北省通县地区，就发生过农民“逃避注射”的事件。预防注射原来是好事，由于强迫命令，就把好事作坏了。贺诚副部长强调指出：在这次学习中，必须大胆揭发官僚主义，因为它已经成为进一步开展卫生工作的绊脚石，官僚主义克服以后，强迫命令和违法乱纪的毛病也可以克服。在这次学习中，要求各级领导干部深刻体会第二届全国卫生会议的精神，勇敢带头揭发工作中的缺点，认真开展批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评。报告最后指出：在这次学习运动结束后，各个卫生工作单位都应制订出准确的工作计划，在实现计划的过程中，必须组织力量经常检查执行情况，及时解决问题。（新华社）
