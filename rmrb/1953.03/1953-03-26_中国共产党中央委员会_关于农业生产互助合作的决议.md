    Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation

    (This resolution was issued as a draft to Party committees at all levels for trial implementation by the CPC Central Committee on December 15, 1951, and was officially adopted by the CPC Central Committee on February 15, 1953, with some revisions.)

    (1) The enthusiasm for production displayed by farmers on the basis of land reform is manifested in two aspects: one is the enthusiasm for individual economy, and the other is the enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation. These productive enthusiasms of the peasants are one of the basic factors for rapidly restoring and developing the national economy and promoting national industrialization. Therefore, the Party's correct leadership in rural production is of extremely great significance.

    (2) After liberation, the peasants' enthusiasm for individual economy is inevitable. The Party fully understands the characteristics of these small private owners and points out that it is impossible to ignore and rudely frustrate this enthusiasm of the peasants for individual economy. In this regard, the Party has adhered to the policy of firmly uniting with the middle peasants. Even the development of the rich peasant economy is allowed. According to the current economic conditions of our country, the individual economy of farmers will still exist in large quantities for a considerable period of time. Therefore, the Common Program of the Political Consultative Conference once pointed out: "Various social and economic components should, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, divide the work and cooperate, each get what it deserves, so as to promote the development of the entire social economy," which includes the "individual economy of peasants and handicraftsmen." In addition to this, the Common Program also has the following provisions: "In areas where land reform has been implemented, the ownership of land obtained by farmers must be protected."

    (3) However, the Party Central Committee has always believed that in order to overcome the difficulties faced by many farmers in decentralized operations, to enable the vast number of poor farmers to rapidly increase production and embark on the road to a well-fed and well-clothed life, and to enable the state to obtain much more commercial grain and other industrial raw materials than it does now, while also increasing the purchasing power of farmers and enabling the country's industrial products to obtain a broad market, it is necessary to advocate "organization," and develop the enthusiasm of farmers for mutual aid and cooperation in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. This kind of mutual aid and cooperation is now based on individual economy (on the basis of farmers' private property), and its development prospect is agricultural collectivization or socialization. The facts over a long period of time have proved that this policy of the Party Central Committee is completely correct. Based on the long-term experience of the liberated areas and the policy of the Party Central Committee, the Common Program of the Political Consultative Conference made a correct provision: "In all areas where land reform has been thoroughly implemented, the people's government should organize peasants and all labor forces that can engage in agricultural production to take the development of agricultural production and its sideline as the central task, and should guide farmers to gradually organize various forms of labor mutual aid and production cooperation in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit." Obviously, this policy of the Party Central Committee and the Common Program actually educates the vast number of farmers, making them gradually understand that labor mutual aid and production cooperation have great advantages over purely isolated individual economy, and enlightening them to gradually transition from individual economy to collective economy.

    (4) The development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement of farmers in agricultural production in various regions has various different historical and complex forms with the development of the rural economy and production requirements in various regions, but there are roughly three main forms. The first form is simple labor mutual aid, which is the most elementary, mainly temporary and seasonal. This form has been the largest in the old liberated areas from the beginning to the present, and it is also suitable for the inherent mutual aid habits of farmers in the newly liberated areas, and it is easy to develop in large quantities. However, this form is generally small; except for the needs of individual situations, it is generally only suitable for small ones. The second form is year-round mutual aid teams, which is a higher form than the first form. Some of them have begun to implement the combination of agricultural and sideline mutual aid; there are some simple production plans, and then gradually combine labor mutual aid with improved technology, and there is some division of labor in technology; some mutual aid teams have gradually set up some publicly owned agricultural tools and livestock, and accumulated a small amount of public property. This type of form still accounts for a small number in various regions; but in areas where the simple labor mutual aid movement has a foundation, that is, in areas where the vast number of farmers have overcome difficulties by organizing, and have made some development in production and have obtained some improvement in life, this form of mutual aid is required by many farmers, and is therefore increasing year by year. The farmers included in the above two forms of mutual aid organizations have developed to account for 60% of all farmers in North China and 70% in Northeast China. The third form is agricultural production cooperatives characterized by land shares, and is therefore also called land cooperatives. This form includes several important characteristics that already exist in some places in the second form, such as the combination of agriculture and sideline, a certain degree of production planning and technical division of labor, some or more commonly used improved farm tools and public property, etc., but in a relatively expanded form. Because there are some public improved farm tools and new farm tools, there is some division of labor, or water conservancy has been built, or wasteland has been reclaimed, which has aroused the requirement for unified land use in production. This is still an agricultural production cooperative based on private land ownership. Using land as shares is also based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and can be withdrawn according to the principle of voluntariness. However, in terms of production, on the one hand, it is convenient to uniformly plan the operation of the land, plant according to the land, and make the best use of the land; on the other hand, it can more conveniently regulate labor and semi-labor, and give play to the enthusiasm of labor division. These two aspects may gradually overcome the weaknesses of the small-scale peasant economy to some extent. Under this third form, the output and income of the land and sideline business are generally greatly increased, except for some cooperatives that are not truly voluntary by the masses, or are not well managed, so they cannot succeed. Generally speaking, this kind of cooperative with land as shares is usually developed on the basis of a better mutual aid movement, and is the advanced form of the agricultural production mutual aid movement at present. At present, it only exists in several counties and districts, and the number is not very large, but there are already more than 300 in the Northeast and North China regions, and it is developing.

    The above three forms are not necessarily clearly divided in various regions, nor are they necessarily uniformly advanced in an orderly manner. There are also individual cases where, under special circumstances, land is jointly owned shortly after the farmers are organized. According to the different conditions in various regions, the masses often have many different forms that are intertwined at the same time, and the development in various regions is very uneven. Generally speaking, the mutual aid and cooperation movement is advancing on a concrete and tortuous road. Regardless of the conditions and experience of the masses, attempting to mechanically apply an abstract formula is of course wrong and will harm the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    According to the general law of movement development and the necessity of developing rural productive forces, the Party's policy for developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement at present should have the following three aspects:

    1.  In all parts of the country, especially in the newly liberated areas and areas where the mutual aid movement is weak, the first form of mutual aid and cooperation movement, namely temporary, seasonal, and simple labor mutual aid, should be developed in a led and large-scale manner. If we look down on this most elementary form that can be accepted by the vast number of farmers at present, and even think that temporary and seasonal exchange of labor is not called mutual aid, and only year-round mutual aid teams are called mutual aid, and refuse to actively lead and promote it, this is wrong.

    2.  In areas with a preliminary foundation for the mutual aid movement, the second form, namely year-round mutual aid teams with more content than simple labor mutual aid, must be gradually promoted in a led manner. If we are satisfied with temporary and seasonal mutual aid for a long time, and do not attempt to further consolidate and improve it, so that farmers may obtain more benefits through year-round mutual aid, this is also wrong.

    3.  In areas where the masses have relatively rich mutual aid experience and have relatively strong leading backbones, the third form, namely agricultural production cooperatives with land shares, should be developed in a led and focused manner. If we ignore the needs of the masses in production, the foundation of the mutual aid movement, the leading backbone, the enthusiasm of the masses, and full deliberation, and only aim high and far, and attempt to simply rely on top-down arrangements and commandism to engage in this third form, this is a formalistic and reckless approach, which is of course wrong.

    The Party Central Committee's policy is a policy of steady progress based on the needs of production development and possible conditions. Rural branches of the Party in various regions should, under the guidance of this policy of the Party Central Committee, educate their members to actively participate in these different agricultural mutual aid and cooperation separately.

    (5) Regarding the issue of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, generally speaking, there are two different erroneous tendencies: one tendency is to adopt a passive attitude towards the mutual aid and cooperation movement, failing to see that this is the necessary path for our Party to guide the vast number of farmers from the small-scale individual economy to the large-scale collective economy using machines for cultivation and harvesting, denying that the various agricultural production cooperatives that have now emerged are transitional forms towards agricultural socialism, denying that they carry socialist elements. This is a right-leaning erroneous thought. Another tendency is to adopt a hasty attitude, regardless of the various necessary conditions for farmers' voluntariness and economic preparation, prematurely and inappropriately attempting to deny or restrict the private property of farmers participating in cooperatives now, or attempting to implement absolute egalitarianism for members of mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, or attempting to quickly establish higher-level socialist collective farms, thinking that socialism can be fully achieved in the countryside completely at once. These are "left"-leaning erroneous thoughts. The Party Central Committee criticized the above two erroneous ideological tendencies, believing that the mutual aid organizations of the peasant laboring masses and the various forms of agricultural production cooperatives that have developed on the basis of the mutual aid movement have very important positive significance. The Central Committee estimated their two aspects of nature, namely the private nature and the cooperative nature. The members of the primary mutual aid team, their means of production are completely private, but they also have the nature of collective labor, which is the bud of socialism. The year-round mutual aid team then makes this bud grow further. The agricultural production cooperative, in terms of being based on private property, farmers having private land ownership and private ownership of other means of production, farmers being able to distribute a certain amount of harvest according to the land shares, and obtaining reasonable prices according to the tools and livestock shares, it preserves the nature of private ownership. In terms of being able to use land uniformly after farmers invest in land shares, rationally use tools, work together, implement piece-rate wages, distribute dividends according to labor, and have certain public property, it has more socialist elements than year-round mutual aid teams. At the same time, the nature of these two aspects also illustrates: although the current agricultural production cooperative is an advanced form of the mutual aid movement in the current transitional period, it is still a lower-level form than the complete socialist collective farm (that is, a higher-level agricultural production cooperative), so it is only a transitional form towards socialist agriculture. However, this transitional form towards socialism is a promising form full of life. The correctness of the Party's policy lies in appropriately estimating the above two aspects of their nature, and thereby cautiously and actively guiding them forward on the basis of gradual development. Ignoring any aspect of the above two aspects of nature, for example, the right-leaning tendency, ignoring the nature of the latter aspect, will inevitably manifest as tailism falling behind life; and another example, the "left"-leaning tendency, ignoring the nature of the former aspect, will inevitably manifest as adventurism exceeding the possibilities of living conditions.

    (6) Past experience has proved that in the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, the leadership method of coercion and command is wrong, and laissez-faire is also wrong. Coercion and command violate the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and are also prone to harming the policy of uniting with the middle peasants. Even if the movement can be temporarily vigorous for a while, it cannot be consolidated. Laissez-faire will cause the mutual aid and cooperation movement to fall into depression and disintegration, or cause capitalist tendencies to grow within the mutual aid teams and cooperatives, thereby increasing the difficulties of poor farmers in production and the situation of selling land, which will only benefit the development of the rich peasant economy and will not benefit the rise of the economic status of poor and hired peasants, which is of course very harmful. The errors that appear in areas where the mutual aid movement has begun to develop are mainly the former. The errors that appear in areas where rural production has developed greatly, the middle peasants have become the majority, and the mutual aid movement needs to continue to move forward are mainly the latter. Some comrades in some places began to commit the error of coercion and command, such as "forced grouping," "comprehensive grouping," "engaging in large exchange-labor teams," and blindly pursuing "advanced forms," etc. After encountering difficulties, they went to the other extreme of laissez-faire. And when the tendency of laissez-faire is criticized and corrected, it is easy to turn around and generate an impetuous and adventurous mood. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to correcting and preventing these two erroneous leadership methods at all times, and to master the correct leadership method. This correct leadership method is first to adopt the method of typical demonstration and gradual promotion, generally from small to large, from few to many, from low-level to high-level. Second, in the work process, always study the experience of the masses at any time and place, concentrate the opinions of the masses, educate the masses, promote correct things, and avoid repeating wrong things. Third, in dealing with any problems that exist within mutual aid teams and production cooperatives, there are two principles that must be absolutely observed, namely the principle of voluntariness and the principle of mutual benefit.

    (7) Demonstration is multi-faceted, but everything needs to be able to truly improve productivity and achieve the goal of producing more grain or other crops and increasing income. Only under the call of producing more grain and increasing income is it possible to mobilize farmers to organize. Only by truly achieving this can agricultural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives truly serve the farmers and be welcomed by the masses, and thus be able to consolidate and influence the surrounding farmers to gradually organize. Therefore, improving productivity, producing more grain or other crops than individual farming, and increasing the income of general members is the standard for checking the quality of the work of any mutual aid team and production cooperative. Whenever the opposite situation occurs, it is necessary to earnestly explore the reasons and overcome the weaknesses or errors.

    (8) According to the materials from various places, the following issues that exist within agricultural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives are of great importance to their consolidation and development and must be paid attention to:

    First, agricultural production must be done conscientiously. Overwhelming work in the countryside is agricultural production work, and other work revolves around agricultural production work and serves it. Any so-called work tasks and work methods that hinder agricultural production must be avoided.

    Second, implement intensive cultivation, build water conservancy projects, improve the soil, and turn dry land into paddy fields in possible areas, plant various crops in a planned way, and improve varieties.

    Third, under the conditions suitable for the local area, develop mutual aid that combines agriculture and sideline businesses (handicrafts, processing industry, transportation industry, animal husbandry, afforestation, fruit tree cultivation, fishery, and others). According to the needs of agriculture and sideline businesses and personal expertise, implement reasonable division of labor and division of industry, and organize women and other semi-labor forces so that everyone can do their best. However, the division of labor and division of industry under the current rural conditions should be flexible, and it is impossible to be too strict.

    Fourth, for the needs of expanding reproduction, and according to the complete voluntariness of team members and cooperative members, funds can be organized in a democratically agreed manner to increase the purchase of publicly owned production tools and livestock. At present, some year-round mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives adopt the method of accumulating public accumulation funds and public welfare funds to prepare for the material basis for expanding production and to prevent natural disasters and man-made disasters. If this is out of the complete voluntariness of the masses, it is acceptable. However, if the masses are not willing, it should not be forced. The proportion of public accumulation funds and public welfare funds in the annual income of mutual aid teams and production cooperatives must not be too high now, and can generally only be appropriately set at 1% to 5% of the annual income. In the event of a poor harvest, public accumulation funds may not be collected. Members have complete freedom to take out the invested funds and the public accumulation funds paid when withdrawing from the team or cooperative. However, for members of production cooperatives with land as shares, it is appropriate to withdraw from the cooperative after the end of the year's harvest. If the production cooperative has spent a lot of money on improving the soil or water conservancy facilities on the withdrawn land, the withdrawer should pay the cooperative a fair price.

    Fifth, in production cooperatives with land as shares, the ratio of harvest distribution based on land and labor should not be too fixed at the beginning. It should be based on the voluntariness of various members, taking into account the conditions of local economic development, and enabling both team members with more labor and less land and team members with more land and less labor to obtain reasonable benefits. Then, in the process of production development and changes in the land due to processing, it will gradually change to a more reasonable ratio that can be accepted by everyone according to the level of awareness and income increase of the masses.

    Sixth, on the issue of equivalence or mutual benefit, it is necessary to: on the one hand, oppose the method of not accounting and not using the principle of equivalence to exchange manpower and animal power; on the other hand, oppose mechanical, cumbersome, and formalistic calculation methods; and focus on the diverse forms of mutual benefit in life and practice, and focus on those calculation methods that are accustomed to the masses and are simple and easy to implement.

    Seventh, establish some necessary, simple, and easy-to-implement production management systems and labor discipline.

    Eighth, stipulate periodic and necessary members' representative meetings, group meetings, and family meetings that are convenient for the masses to implement and are not necessarily limited to fixed forms, so as to discuss, check, and improve the issues of production plans, problems in the production process, issues of mutual benefit among members, issues of mutual care and support among members when encountering natural disasters and misfortunes, implement necessary criticism and self-criticism, etc.

    Ninth, promote the movement of mutual teaching and mutual learning of new and old production technologies, popularize and improve the useful and reasonable parts of old technologies and old experiences, gradually combine them with new technologies that can be applied, and constantly improve farming methods.

    Tenth, promote patriotic production competitions among teams and teams, cooperatives and cooperatives, team members and team members, and cooperative members and cooperative members. It is necessary to put forward patriotic slogans in the countryside to link the production of farmers with the needs of the country. It is wrong to put forward the slogan of "getting rich" one-sidedly. Of course, it is also wrong not to specifically link patriotic slogans with improving the lives of farmers.

    Eleventh, cultivate and reward active producers and technical experts in a measured manner, and train production group leaders. Communist Party members and Youth League members should become models for all farmers in implementing the principles of mutual aid and cooperation, actively producing, and observing discipline, and should not greedily take any undue advantage in mutual aid teams and cooperatives.

    Twelfth, it should not be allowed to carry out the exploitation of hired labor (that is, the exploitation of rich peasants) within agricultural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives. Therefore, team members or cooperative members should not be allowed to hire long-term workers to join the team or cooperative, nor should mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives be allowed to hire long-term workers to cultivate the land. If there is such a situation, it should be discussed by the team members and cooperative members meeting to stipulate the methods for correction or reorganization. However, mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives may hire short-term workers, shepherds, and technicians for the needs of production.

    Thirteenth, strengthen the Party's political work within mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, establish regular political education and cultural education, and improve the awareness of the masses to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses for production.

    The Party Central Committee has repeatedly pointed out that when solving the specific methods of various different problems of the above-mentioned agricultural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives or stipulating their specific systems, not only should differences between various places be allowed, but also differences between various townships and villages and even between various mutual aid teams and cooperatives within one township and one village should be allowed. Therefore, it must be flexible and suitable for gradual improvement, and it should never be simply forced to be uniform and make too rigid decisions.

    (9) Supply and marketing cooperatives should establish contractual relationships with agricultural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives for promotion, ordering, and loans, help them overcome difficulties in production (insufficient funds) and exchange (market isolation), so that the production possibilities of agriculture and sideline businesses and the exchange possibilities of domestic and foreign markets can be fully and reliably linked.

    (10) The Party and the people's government should appropriately take the following measures to assist the development of agricultural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives:

    First, state-owned economic organs, either through supply and marketing cooperatives or directly with agricultural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, should establish various possible economic contracts.

    Second, lend seeds, fertilizers, and farm tools to farmers, thereby helping them to effectively organize. Pay special attention to helping farmers establish various special crop mutual aid teams and production cooperatives, such as cotton, hemp, peanuts, tobacco leaves, etc., various sideline and handicraft production cooperatives, and mutual aid teams and cooperatives for repairing water conservancy, repairing beaches, afforestation, managing aquatic products, and animal husbandry, etc., in suitable areas, taking into account the needs of the state and the people. Among them, organizing cotton farmers to join mutual aid teams and cooperatives is particularly important.

    Third, because the development of agricultural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives saves a large amount of labor, under the current conditions, attention should be paid to helping this surplus labor to be used as much as possible for land processing and developing the diverse economies that are possible in the local countryside, and according to the needs of industrial development, a group of people should be planned to be absorbed into factories and mines to work successively. In order to provide more outlets for the current rural labor force, people's governments at all levels should, in coordination with the state's overall economic construction plan, gradually organize some possible and necessary public utilities, such as public-owned workshops and handicrafts (manufacturing agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, medicines, etc.), public-owned processing industries, large-scale afforestation, water conservancy construction, road construction, etc.

    Fourth, people's governments at and above the county level and Party committees at all levels should set up special personnel and appropriate institutions, closely contact with financial and economic organs and supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels, and regularly study and guide in a timely manner the organization, production plans, supply, transportation, and sales of agricultural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, and hold necessary cadre training courses for them.

    (11) State-owned farms should be promoted. In addition to planning to establish a number of state-owned farms that are mechanized and semi-mechanized, each county should have at least one to two state-owned farms of the nature of agricultural experiment stations, on the one hand, to educate all farmers with the examples of the advantages of modern farms that improve agricultural technology and use new farm tools; on the other hand, to provide agricultural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives with technical assistance and guidance according to possible conditions. In places where farmers completely agree and have appropriate economic conditions, a small number of socialist collective farms can also be tried out, such as one to several in each province, so as to gain experience and serve as a demonstration for farmers.

    (12) Representative meetings of agricultural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives can be convened once each before spring plowing and after autumn harvest at the district and county levels. At the provincial and national levels, a working conference with appropriate cadres participating shall be convened once a year.

    (13) After solving many problems related to agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, the Party Central Committee believes that it is necessary to repeatedly call the attention of Party committees at all levels and all comrades and non-Party activists engaged in rural work to fully, enthusiastically, and without prejudice to care for, help, and patiently educate individual farmers, and it must be admitted that their individual farming is legal (as stipulated by the Common Program and the Land Reform Law), do not ridicule them, do not scold them for being backward, and even less allow the use of threats and restrictions to crack down on them. Agricultural loans must be reasonably lent to both mutual aid and cooperation organizations and individual farmers, and should not only be given to mutual aid and cooperation organizations without giving or giving less to individual farmers. In a rural area, even if the vast majority of farmers have joined mutual aid teams or cooperatives, and only a very small number of individual farmers remain, an attitude of respect and unity should be adopted towards these few people. It must be understood that our present expression of concern and appropriate care for individual farmers makes it possible for these individual farmers to gradually join mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the future, and it is also possible to realize our ultimate goal in the countryside - to guide all farmers towards socialism and communism.

### 中国共产党中央委员会  关于农业生产互助合作的决议

    中国共产党中央委员会
    关于农业生产互助合作的决议
    （这个决议于一九五一年十二月十五日中共中央以草案形式发给各级党委试行，至一九五三年二月十五日中共中央通过成为正式决议，并做了部分的修改。）
    （一）农民在土地改革基础上所发扬起来的生产积极性，表现在两个方面：一方面是个体经济的积极性，另方面是互助合作的积极性。农民的这些生产积极性，是迅速恢复和发展国民经济和促进国家工业化的基本因素之一。因此，党对于农村生产的正确领导，具有极重大的意义。
    （二）解放后农民对于个体经济的积极性是不可避免的。党充分地了解了农民这种小私有者的特点，并指出不能忽视和粗暴地挫折农民这种个体经济的积极性。在这方面，党是坚持了巩固地联合中农的政策。对于富农经济，也还是让它发展的。根据我们国家现在的经济条件，农民个体经济在一个相当长的时期内，将还是大量存在的。因此，政治协商会议共同纲领曾经指出：应该“使各种社会经济成份在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所，以促进整个社会经济的发展”，其中即包括了“农民和手工业者的个体经济”。除此之外，共同纲领还有以下的规定：“凡已实行土地改革的地区，必须保护农民已得土地的所有权。”
    （三）但是，党中央从来认为要克服很多农民在分散经营中所发生的困难，要使广大贫困的农民能够迅速地增加生产而走上丰衣足食的道路，要使国家得到比现在多得多的商品粮食及其他工业原料，同时也就提高农民的购买力，使国家的工业品得到广大的销场，就必须提倡“组织起来”，按照自愿和互利的原则，发展农民互助合作的积极性。这种互助合作在现在是建立在个体经济基础上（农民私有财产的基础上）的集体劳动，其发展前途就是农业集体化或社会主义化。长时期以来的事实，证明党中央这个方针是完全正确的。政治协商会议共同纲领根据人民解放区长期的经验和党中央的方针，曾经作出了正确的规定：“在一切已彻底实现土地改革的地区，人民政府应组织农民及一切可以从事农业的劳动力以发展农业生产及其副业为中心任务，并应引导农民逐步地按照自愿和互利的原则，组织各种形式的劳动互助和生产合作。”显然，党中央的和共同纲领上的这个方针在实际上教育着广大农民，使他们逐步地懂得劳动互助和生产合作比起单纯的孤立的个体经济有极大的优越性，启发他们由个体经济逐步地过渡到集体经济的道路。
    （四）各地农民在农业生产上的互助合作运动的发展是随着各地农村经济的发展与生产的要求，而有各种不同的历史和复杂的形式，但是大体上有三种主要的形式。第一种形式是简单的劳动互助，这是最初级的，主要是临时性的，季节性的。这种形式在老解放区从开始到现在都是最大量的，在新解放区也是适合于农民固有的互助习惯，便于大量发展的。但这种形式一般地都是小型的；除了个别情况的需要以外，一般地也只能是以小型的为适宜。第二种形式是常年的互助组，这是比第一种形式较高的形式。它们中有一部分开始实行农业和副业的互助相结合；有某些简单的生产计划，随后逐步地把劳动互助和提高技术相结合，有某些技术的分工；有的互助组并逐步地设置了一部分公有农具和牲畜，积累了小量的公有财产。这类形式在各地还占少数；但在简单的劳动互助运动已有基础的地区，即广大农民已经由组织起来克服困难、而在生产上已有某些发展和在生活上已获得某些改善的地区，这种互助的形式为许多农民所要求，因而逐年在增加中。以上两种形式的互助组织所包括的农民，在华北已发展到占全体农民的百分之六十，在东北则达到了百分之七十。第三种形式是以土地入股为特点的农业生产合作社，因此或称为土地合作社。这种形式包括了第二种形式中在有些地方已经存在的若干重要的特点，即如上述的农业与副业的结合，一定程度上的生产计划性和技术的分工，有些或多或少的共同使用的改良农具和公有财产，等等，但带了比较扩大的形式。因为有了某些公共的改良农具和新式农具，有了某些分工分业，或兴修了水利，或开垦了荒地，就引起了在生产上统一土地使用的要求。这还是在土地私有基础上的农业生产合作社。用土地入股同样地是根据自愿和互利的原则，并可以根据自愿的原则退股。但在生产上，一方面，便于统一计划土地的经营，因地种植，使地尽其用；另方面，可以更方便地调剂劳动力和半劳动力，发挥劳动分工的积极性。这两方面，也就可能逐渐在若干点上克服小农经济的弱点。在这第三种形式下经营的土地和副业，除了有的合作社因为并不是群众的真正自愿，或经营不合理所以不能成功以外，产量与收入一般地都大大增加。一般地说来，这种以土地入股的合作社通常是在较好的互助运动基础上发展起来的，是农业生产互助运动在现在的高级形式，目前还只是在若干县区存在，数量还不很多，但在东北华北两区也已经有了三百多个，并正在发展中。
    上述这三种形式，在各地并不一定都是截然划分的，也并不一定都是整齐划一地循序而进的。也有个别在特殊的情形下，当农民组织起来后不久，便实行土地合股的。根据各地不同的条件，群众时常同时存在着许多不同的互相交错的形式，而且各地发展是很不平衡的。一般地说来，互助合作运动是在具体的曲折的道路上前进着的。不问群众的条件和经验如何，企图用一种抽象的公式去机械地硬套，当然是错误的，是会损害互助合作运动的发展的。
    根据运动发展的一般规律和发展农村生产力的必要性，党在目前对于发展互助合作运动的方针，应该有下列三个方面：
    一、在全国各地，特别在新解放区和互助运动薄弱的地区，有领导地大量地发展互助合作运动的第一种形式，即临时性的季节性的简单的劳动互助。如果看轻这种为目前广大农民所可能接受的最初级的形式，甚至认为临时性和季节性的变工换工不叫互助，只有常年互助组才叫做互助，而不肯积极地去领导推广，这是错误的。
    二、在有初步互助运动基础的地区，必须有领导地逐步地推广第二种形式，即比简单的劳动互助有更多内容的常年互助组。如果长期地只满足于临时性的季节性的互助，而不企图进一步加以巩固和加以提高，使农民可能经过常年的互助获得更多的利益，这也是错误的。
    三、在群众有比较丰富的互助经验，而又有比较坚强的领导骨干的地区，应当有领导地同时又是有重点地发展第三种形式，即土地入股的农业生产合作社。如果不顾群众在生产中的需要、互助运动的基础、领导的骨干、群众的积极性、并有充分的酝酿等项条件，而只是好高骛远，企图单纯地依靠自上而下的布置和命令主义的方法去大搞这第三种形式，这是形式主义和轻举妄动的做法，当然是错误的。
    党中央的方针就是根据生产发展的需要与可能的条件而稳步前进的方针。党在各种不同地区的农村支部，应该在党中央这种方针的指导下，教育自己的党员积极地分别参加这些不同的农业互助和合作。
    （五）关于农业互助合作的问题，总的说来有两种不同的错误的倾向：一种倾向是采取消极的态度对待互助合作运动，看不出这是我党引导广大农民群众从小生产的个体经济逐渐走向大规模的使用机器耕种和收割的集体经济所必经的道路，否认现在业已出现的各种农业生产合作社是走向农业社会主义化的过渡的形式，否认它们带有社会主义的因素。这是右倾的错误的思想。另一种倾向是采取急躁的态度，不顾农民自愿和经济准备的各种必须的条件，过早地、不适宜地企图在现在就否定或限制参加合作社的农民的私有财产，或者企图对于互助组和农业生产合作社的成员实行绝对平均主义，或者企图很快地举办更高级的社会主义化的集体农庄，认为现在可以一蹴而在农村中完全达到社会主义。这些是“左”倾的错误的思想。党中央批判了上述两种错误的思想倾向，认为农民劳动群众的互助组织以及在互助运动基础上所发展起来的现在各种形式的农业生产合作社有很重要的积极意义。中央估计了它们的两方面的性质，即私有的性质和合作的性质。初级互助组的组员，他们的生产资料是完全私有的，但也带了共同劳动的性质，这就是社会主义的萌芽。常年互助组则使这种萌芽进一步生长起来了。农业生产合作社，就其建立在私有财产的基础上，农民有土地私有权和其他生产资料的私有权，农民得按入股的土地分配一定的收获量，并得按入股的工具及牲畜取得合理的代价这些条件来说，它保存着私有的性质。就其在农民以土地入股后得以统一使用土地，合理使用工具，共同劳动，实行计工取酬，按劳分红，并有某些公共的财产这些条件来说，它就比常年互助组具有更多的社会主义的因素。同时，这两方面的性质也正说明了：现在所称的农业生产合作社虽然是互助运动在现在过渡时期出现的高级形式，但是比起完全的社会主义的集体农庄（即是更高级的农业生产合作社），这还是较低级的形式，因此，它还只是走向社会主义农业的过渡的形式。可是，这种走向社会主义的过渡的形式又正是富有生命的有前途的形式。党的政策的正确性，就是在于恰当地估计它们的上述两方面的性质，而由此谨慎地又积极地在逐步发展的基础上，引导它们前进。忽视上述两方面性质的任何一方面，例如右的倾向，忽视上述后一方面的性质，就必然表现为落在生活后面的尾巴主义；又例如“左”的倾向，忽视上述前一方面的性质，就必然表现为超越生活条件可能性的冒险主义。
    （六）过去的经验证明：在农业的互助合作运动上，强迫命令的领导方法是错误的，放任自流也是错误的。强迫命令就是违反自愿和互利的原则，而且容易伤害联合中农的政策，即使运动能够暂时轰轰烈烈一阵，但是不能够巩固的。放任自流会使互助合作运动陷于消沉和解体，或使互助组和合作社内部滋长资本主义的倾向，因而增加贫苦农民在生产中的困难和出卖土地的情况，结果只有利于富农经济的发展而不利于贫雇农经济地位的上升，这当然是很有害的。在互助运动开始发展的地区所出现的错误，主要的是前一种。在农村生产已经有较大的发展、中农已经成为多数、而互助运动需要继续前进的地区所出现的错误，主要的是后一种。有些地方的同志开始犯了强迫命令的错误，例如“强迫编组”、“全面编组”、“搞大变工队”和盲目地追求“高级形式”等等。在碰到困难之后，就又走入放任自流这另一个极端。而当批判和纠正了放任自流的倾向之后，又容易反转过来产生急躁冒进的情绪。因此，必须随时注意纠正和防止这两种错误的领导方法，而掌握正确的领导方法。这种正确的领导方法，首先是采取典型示范而逐步推广的方法，一般地是由小到大，由少到多，由低级到高级。第二、在工作过程中，总是随时随地研究群众的经验，集中群众的意见，教育群众，发扬正确的东西，避免重复错误的东西。第三、在处理互助组和生产合作社内部所存在的任何问题上，有两条原则是必须绝对遵守的，就是自愿的原则和互利的原则。
    （七）示范是在多方面的，但一切事情需要能够真正做到提高生产率，达到多产粮食或其他作物、增加收入这一个目的。只有在多产粮食增加收入这样的号召下，才可能动员农民组织起来。也只有真正做到这一点，农业互助组和农业生产合作社才是真正为农民服务，而为群众所欢迎，因而可能巩固下来，并影响四周围的农民逐步地组织起来。因此，提高生产率，比单干要多产粮食或多产其他作物，增加一般成员的收入，这是检查任何互助组和生产合作社的工作好坏的标准。凡是出现相反情况的，就必须认真探求原因，克服其中的弱点或错误。
    （八）根据各地方的材料，现在农业互助组和农业生产合作社内部所存在的问题，对于他们的巩固和发展有重大关键的，有如下各项必须予以注意：
    第一、必须认真做好农业生产。在农村中压倒一切的工作是农业生产工作，其他工作都是围绕农业生产工作而为它服务的。任何妨碍农业生产的所谓工作任务和工作方法，必须避免。
    第二、实行精耕细作，兴修水利，改良土壤，并在可能的地区把旱地变成水地，有计划地种植各种农作物，改良品种。
    第三、在适宜于当地的条件下，发展农业和副业
    （手工业、加工工业、运输业、畜牧、造林、培养果树、渔业及其他）相结合的互助。按照农业和副业的需要和个人的专长，实行合理的分工分业，并把妇女及其他半劳动力组织起来，使人尽其力。但在现在农村条件下的分工分业应带有灵活性，太严密是不可能的。
    第四、为了扩大再生产的需要，并根据组员和社员的完全自愿，可以民主议定的方式，组织资金，增购公有的生产工具和牲畜。现在有些常年互助组和农业生产合作社，采取集累公积金和公益金的方式，用以准备扩大生产的物质基础和防备天灾人祸，如果是出于群众的完全自愿，这是可以的。但如果群众还不愿意，则不宜勉强去做。公积金和公益金所占互助组和生产合作社岁入的比例，现在决不能太多，一般只可以比较适宜地定为占岁入的百分之一到百分之五。在收成不好时，可以不收公积金。成员退组退社时有带出所投资金和所纳公积金的完全自由。但以土地入股的生产合作社成员如要退社，应在一年的收获完毕之后为适宜。如生产合作社在所退土地上曾经为改良土壤或水利设备而有颇大耗费的情况，则退社者应向合作社偿付公平的代价。
    第五、在土地合股的生产合作社中，关于收获量的分配，按土地和按劳动的比例，开始不宜于规定得太死，应根据各种成员的自愿，照顾当地经济发展的条件，并使劳力较多而土地较少的社员和土地较多而劳力较少的社员，都能够获得合理的利益，然后在生产发展以及土地由于加工所引起的变化的过程中，根据群众的觉悟程度和收入的增益，逐渐变动到更合理的而又为大家所能够接受的比例。
    第六、在等价或互利的问题上，必须：一方面，反对不算账、不用等价原则交换人力畜力的方法；另方面，反对机械的、烦琐的、形式主义的计算方法；而注重生活和实际上的多种多样的互利形式，注重那些为群众所习惯而简明易行的计算办法。
    第七、建立一些必要的简明易行的生产管理制度和劳动纪律。
    第八、规定为群众所便于实行的、不一定限在固定形式上的、定期的又是必要的成员代表会议，小组会议和家庭会议，以便讨论、检查和改进生产计划的问题，生产过程中的问题，社员互利的问题，社员在遇到天灾和祸难时互相关照扶助的问题，实行必要的批评和自我批评等等。
    第九、提倡新旧生产技术的互教互学运动，普及和提高旧技术旧经验中的有用的合理的部分，逐步地与那些可能应用的新技术相结合，不断地改良农作法。
    第十、提倡组和组、社和社、组员和组员、社员和社员之间的爱国丰产竞赛。必须在农村中提出爱国的口号，使农民的生产和国家的要求联系起来。片面地提出“发家致富”的口号，是错误的。当然，不把爱国的口号和改善农民的生活具体地联系起来，也是不对的。
    第十一、培养并有分寸地奖励生产的积极分子和技术能手，训练生产小组组长。共产党员和青年团员实行互助合作的原则、积极生产、遵守纪律等，应成为全体农民的模范，不能在互助组和合作社中贪占任何非分的便宜。
    第十二、在农业互助组和农业生产合作社内部，不应允许进行雇佣劳动的剥削（即富农的剥削）。因此，不应允许组员或社员雇长工入组入社，也不应允许互助组和农业生产合作社雇长工耕种土地。如果有此种情况，应由组员和社员会议讨论，规定出纠正或改组的办法。但互助组和农业生产合作社为生产的需要，得雇请短工、牧工和技术人员。
    第十三、加强党对互助组和农业生产合作社内部的政治工作，建立经常的政治教育和文化教育，提高群众的觉悟，以鼓励群众的生产积极性。
    党中央再三指出：在解决上述农业互助组和农业生产合作社各种不同问题的具体办法或规定它们的具体制度的时候，不但应该容许各地方之间有差别，而且应该容许各乡各村之间乃至一乡一村内各互助组各合作社之间有差别，因此，必须是灵活的，宜于逐步改进的，决不应该简单地强求划一，做出太过硬性的决定。
    （九）供销合作社应该与农业互助组和农业生产合作社建立推销、订购和贷款的合同的关系，帮助它们克服生产方面（资金不足）和交换方面（市场隔离）的困难，使农业及副业的生产的可能性和国内外市场的交换的可能性能够充分地而又可靠地联系起来。
    （十）党和人民政府应该适当地采取下列一些办法援助农业互助组和农业生产合作社的发展：
    第一、国营经济机关，或者经过供销合作社，或者直接和农业互助组及农业生产合作社，成立各种可能的经济上的合同。
    第二、用种子、肥料和农具贷给农民，从而帮助他们能够有效地组织起来。特别注意在适宜地区，斟酌国家和人民的需要，帮助农民成立各种特种作物，例如棉花、麻、花生、烟叶等等的互助组和生产合作社，各种副业和手工业的生产合作社，以及修水利、修滩、造林、经营水产和牧畜等的互助组和合作社。其中，组织棉农加入互助组和合作社，显得特别重要。
    第三、因为农业互助组和农业生产合作社的发展节约出了广大的劳动力，在目前条件下，应该注意帮助使这种多余的劳动力能够尽量用于土地加工和发展当地农村可能的多种经济，并按照工业发展的需要，有计划地吸收一批人陆续到工厂和矿山做工。为着使现在农村的劳动力有更多的出路，各级人民政府应配合国家整个经济建设的计划，逐步地举办一些可能的和必需的公共事业，例如公营的工场手工业（制造农具、化学肥料、药品等类），公营的某些加工工业，大规模的造林，兴修水利，建筑道路，等等。
    第四、县以上各级人民政府和各级党委，都应该设置专人以及适宜的机构，与各级财政经济机关及供销合作社密切联系，经常研究和及时地指导农业互助组和农业生产合作社的组织、生产计划、供给、运输和销售的事宜，并为它们举办必需的干部训练班。
    （十一）国营农场应该推广。除有计划地举办若干机耕半机耕的国营农场外，每县至少有一个至两个农事试验场性质的国营农场，一方面用改进农业技术和使用新式农具这种现代化农场的优越性的范例，教育全体农民；另方面，按照可能的条件，给农业互助组和农业生产合作社以技术上的援助和指导。在农民完全同意和有适当经济条件的地方，亦可试办少数社会主义性质的集体农庄，例如每省有一个至几个，以便取得经验，并为农民示范。
    （十二）农业互助组和农业生产合作社的代表会议，在区一级和县一级，可于每年春耕之前和秋收之后各召集一次。在省和全国范围内，则于每年召集一次有适当干部参加的工作会议。
    （十三）在解决了有关农业互助合作的许多问题之后，党中央认为必须重复地唤起各级党委和一切从事农村工作的同志和非党积极分子的注意，要充分地满腔热情地没有隔阂地去照顾、帮助和耐心地教育单干农民，必须承认他们的单干是合法的（为共同纲领和土地改革法所规定），不要讥笑他们，不要骂他们落后，更不允许采用威胁和限制的方法打击他们。农业贷款必须合理地贷给互助合作组织和单干农民两方面，不应当只给互助合作组织方面贷款，而不给或少给单干农民方面贷款。在一个农村内，那怕绝大多数农民都加入了互助组或合作社，单干农民只有极少数，也应采取尊重和团结这少数人的态度。必须明白：我们在现在表示关心和适当地照顾单干农民，就有可能使这些单干农民在将来逐步地加入互助合作组织，也就有可能实现我们在农村中的最后目的——引导全体农民走向社会主义和共产主义。
