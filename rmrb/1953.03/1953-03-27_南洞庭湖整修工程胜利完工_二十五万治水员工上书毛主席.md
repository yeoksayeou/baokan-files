Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 25th: The South Dongting Lake renovation project in Hunan Province was successfully completed on March 20th. Over 70 working days, 250,000 laborers completed over 23.1 million cubic meters of earthwork. Only the remaining riprap slope protection and reed slope protection projects are still under intensive construction. In addition, the originally unplanned Xin'quan Temple eight-arch drainage sluice gate and the Sezimu Temple and Nanhu Zhou two medium-sized culverts are all being poured with concrete, and are expected to be completed in April.

The South Dongting Lake renovation project started on December 10th last year. Construction was suspended for more than 20 days due to rain and snow. The laborers displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm under the circumstances of tight time and arduous tasks. They built more than 20 li of embankments in the more than two-meter-deep silty lake; merged 41 scattered and isolated weirs into three large contiguous weirs; and completed 13 closure projects such as Liujia Lake and Wangjia River, cutting off eight rivers, making the Zi River and Xiang River flow docilely into Dongting Lake along the newly整理four floodways. The newly built more than 500-li-long lakeside dam has been planted with more than 2 million wave-resistant willows. Now, this dam, like a magnificent Great Wall, powerfully protects the Binnan Dongting Lake and the tail-end areas of the Xiang and Zi rivers, enabling farmers on the vast plain to develop production with peace of mind.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 25th: The 250,000 employees who participated in the South Dongting Lake renovation project wrote to Chairman Mao on March 20th, reporting that the South Dongting Lake renovation project had been successfully completed on that day. The letter said: From the day we set foot on the construction site, we felt an unspeakable joy in our hearts, because we are the people of your hometown, and we are honorably participating in the construction of the motherland. We have a common determination: to make contributions to the motherland. In the Wangjia River closure battle, no matter how rapid the water flow, how high the waves, or how heavy the wind and snow, thousands of people fought day and night for more than 70 days. Gan Juqiu, a model of rescue who had met you in Beijing, and the technical team he led, researched and developed a method of throwing "iron caltrops", and finally cut off the "fierce dragon" and built a dam like an earthen mountain across the river. At the Yapo Pond construction site, the new embankment built from the silty lake collapsed more than a hundred times. However, when the laborers of Xiangtan County shouted your glorious name and thought of their own liberation days, no difficulties could stop them. Under the slogan of "repairing wherever it collapses," they finally won. Heroic deeds and model figures like this, representing the noble qualities of the working people of New China, are countless among the workers, peasants, technicians, administrative personnel, political workers, and logistics workers of our 250,000-strong lake management army. More than 13,000 people were commended for their contributions and became heroes and models during the construction. More than 800 people gloriously joined the Communist Party of China, and more than 5,700 young people joined the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. This time, we not only transformed nature, but also transformed ourselves. Everyone deeply experienced that: following you and the Communist Party of China forever will bring good days. The farmers in our team, because they personally saw the benefits of being organized this time: grouping according to labor, evaluating work and calculating points, and carrying out patriotic labor competitions, which increased the average labor efficiency by more than two times; so they must establish mutual aid teams when they return to their hometowns and strive to win a great victory on the patriotic bumper harvest front in 1953.

    南洞庭湖整修工程胜利完工
    二十五万治水员工上书毛主席
    【新华社长沙二十五日电】湖南省南洞庭湖整修工程已于三月二十日胜利完工。二十五万民工在七十多个工作日中，共完成土方二千三百一十多万公方。只有余下的块石护坡和芦苇护坡工程，仍在加紧施工。此外，原计划外的新泉寺八孔排水闸和塞梓庙、南湖洲两座中型涵洞，都正在浇灌混凝土，预计四月间能全部完成。
    南洞庭湖整修工程是在去年十二月十日动工的，施工期间遇到雨、雪而停工的有二十多天。民工们在时间紧迫、任务艰巨的情况下，发挥了高度的劳动热情。他们在两公尺多深的淤泥湖泊中，修起了二十多里长的堤段；把四十一个分散孤立的垸子，并成了三个成片的大垸子；做了刘家湖、王家河等十三处堵口工程，斩断了八条河流，使资水和湘水驯服地沿着新整理的四条洪道流入洞庭湖。新修起来的五百多里长的临湖大堤，已种上两百多万株防浪柳。现在，这道大堤像雄伟的长城一样，有力地保卫着滨南洞庭湖和湘、资两水尾闾地区，使千里平原上的农民能够安心发展生产。
    【新华社长沙二十五日电】参加南洞庭湖整修工程的二十五万员工，在三月二十日上书毛主席，报告南洞庭湖整修工程已在这一天胜利完工。信中说：从踏上工地那天起，我们心里就有一种说不出的快活，因为我们是您的故乡的人民，光荣地参加了祖国的建设。我们有一个共同的决心：要为祖国立功。在王家河堵口战斗中，不管水流多急，浪头多高，风雪多大，上千人日以继夜地奋战了七十多天。曾到北京和您见过面的抢险模范甘菊秋，和他领导的技术队员一起研究出抛“铁菱角”的办法，终于斩断了“凶龙”，穿河修起了像座土山样的大堤。在鸭婆塘工地上，从淤泥湖里筑起的新堤，塌下去一百多次。但是，湘潭县的民工们一喊出您的光荣的名字，一想起自己的翻身日子，什么困难都拦不住他们。在“塌到那里就修到那里”的战斗口号下，他们终于胜利了。像这样代表着新中国劳动人民的高贵品质的英雄事迹和模范人物，在我们二十五万治湖大军中的工人、农民、技术人员、行政人员、政治工作人员、后勤工作人员中间是说不完的。施工中有一万三千多人立了功，当了英雄和模范。有八百多人光荣地加入了中国共产党，有五千七百多个青年加入了中国新民主主义青年团。我们这次不仅改造了自然，也改造了自己。大家更深切地体验到：永远跟着您和中国共产党走，就有好日子过。我们队伍中的农民，因为这次亲眼看到了组织起来的好处：按劳编组，评工计分，开展爱国劳动竞赛，使平均劳动效率提高两倍多；所以回到乡里一定要成立互助组，争取在一九五三年爱国丰产战线上打个大胜仗。
