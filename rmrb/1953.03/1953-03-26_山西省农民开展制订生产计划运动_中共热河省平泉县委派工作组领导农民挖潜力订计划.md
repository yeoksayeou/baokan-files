    Shanxi Province Farmers Launch Production Plan Formulation Movement
    CPC Rehe Province Pingquan County Committee Dispatches Work Team to Lead Farmers in Exploring Potential and Setting Plans
    Farmers in Shanxi Province are launching a production plan formulation movement. More than thirty counties and 50,126 villages, agricultural producers' cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and households across the province have formulated annual or first-season production plans, of which more than 300 villages, agricultural producers' cooperatives, and mutual aid teams have also formulated long-term construction plans for three or five years. The plans include the development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and basic construction.
    In the plan formulation movement, most areas in Shanxi Province first summarized last year's bumper harvest experience, and then widely educated cadres and farmers about the prospects of national industrialization, explaining the importance of agricultural production in coordinating with industrial production development and strengthening agricultural production planning, so that formulating plans became a conscious action of farmers. Pingquan County widely unfolded the plan formulation movement due to fully utilizing the wisdom of farmers and exploring agricultural production potential in many aspects; the enthusiasm of farmers in the county has been greatly improved, and they unanimously believe that they have a goal to move forward.
    The plan formulation movement in various parts of Shanxi Province also has many problems. Some areas do not adequately plan for improving and expanding reproduction, but excessively emphasize improving and raising living standards. Pianqiao Village in Wenxi County even made inappropriate demands to set up a farm tool manufacturing plant within three years. In some areas, leading cadres monopolize the work, not consulting with the masses, or not considering the actual conditions, so the plans are either too high or too low, or the plans only have production increase figures without specific methods to achieve the increase. Some agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams blindly emphasized collective operation, planning chicken raising, sewing, milling, etc., resulting in being divorced from the production needs of members. Some areas failed to grasp the key to increasing production locally, and estimated all kinds of usable production potentials, making the plans old-fashioned. Some areas lacked an overall national concept, and the plans were not based on national needs. Changzhi Prefecture once mistakenly proposed "grow whatever produces more and has a higher price." Some counties in Yuncheng Prefecture only focused on increasing cotton production, ignoring the increase in wheat and other grain crops.
    The Shanxi Provincial People's Government has instructed all localities to repeatedly and strictly review and revise the plans that have been formulated and those that are being formulated. The Changzhi Prefectural Commissioner's Office has reviewed the plans of various counties, criticized the shortcomings in the plans, and proposed specific improvement methods. (Xinhua News Agency)
    The CPC Pingquan County Committee of Rehe Province dispatched a work team this spring to conduct in-depth rural investigations into agricultural production potential, specifically leading the farmers of Wushijiazi Village to formulate a production increase plan.
    Wushijiazi Village is a village that has increased production year after year. Last year, the average yield per hectare (equivalent to fifteen mu) reached 4,160 catties. When the farmers in the village discussed and formulated this year's production increase plan, they all had the idea of "reaching the top of production increase"; Sun Fang, deputy secretary of the CPC branch, also said: "It is really difficult to maintain year-on-year production increases." In response to this sentiment, the work team of the CPC Pingquan County Committee started by investigating and studying the village's agricultural production potential and promoting local bumper harvest experiences, allowing farmers to conduct discussions with examples of good and bad production. For example, the soil quality of farmer Bai Jianchao and Li You's fields is the same. Li You used the method of retaining seedlings and harvested more than 10,000 catties of millet per hectare, while Bai Jianchao only harvested more than 2,000 catties per hectare because he did not replenish the seedlings. From the facts, the farmers understood that the current exploration of agricultural production potential is mainly a matter of fully utilizing land fertility. According to the local farmers' requirements for improving cultivation techniques, the work team proposed the cultivation method of "rational close planting, equidistant full seedlings," and explained that specific measures must be taken to ensure full and strong seedlings, such as drought resistance and moisture conservation, timely sowing, soil improvement, rational fertilization, pest and disease prevention, high planting in low-lying areas, and low planting in mountainous areas. At the same time, the work team also made comparative models of six crops, such as millet and sorghum, showing the production increase due to "rational close planting, equidistant full seedlings" and the production decrease due to sparse seedlings, and mobilized farmers to visit; held bumper harvest technology training classes, so that more than 100 farmers learned the cultivation method of "rational close planting, equidistant full seedlings."
    Now, the farmers of Wushijiazi Village are very enthusiastic about production, and all mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives have formulated production increase plans. The farmers of the village plan to cultivate bumper harvest fields on more than 42 percent of all cultivated land this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 山西省农民开展制订生产计划运动  中共热河省平泉县委派工作组领导农民挖潜力订计划

    山西省农民开展制订生产计划运动
    中共热河省平泉县委派工作组领导农民挖潜力订计划
    山西省农民开展制订生产计划运动。全省已有三十多个县和五万零一百二十六个村、农业生产合作社、互助组、户订出全年或第一季的生产计划，其中有三百多个村、农业生产合作社、互助组还订出了三年或五年的长期建设计划。计划包括农业、林业、畜牧业的发展和基本建设。
    在订计划运动中，山西省各地大多先总结去年的丰产经验，然后广泛地向干部、农民进行国家工业化的前途教育，说明农业生产要配合工业生产发展和加强农业生产计划性的重要意义，使订计划成为农民的自觉行动。平顺县由于充分发挥农民智慧，多方面发掘农业生产潜在力，订计划运动就普遍展开；全县农民生产积极性大大提高，一致认为有了前进目标。
    山西省各地的订计划运动，也还存在不少问题。有的地区对提高与扩大再生产计划不周，却过分强调改善与提高生活。闻喜县偏桥村甚至提出三年内要办起农具制造厂的不适当要求。有的地区领导干部包办代替，不和群众商量，或是不考虑实际条件，因而不是计划过高过低，就是计划只有增产数字，没有实现增产的具体办法。有些农业生产合作社和互助组盲目强调集体经营，计划、养鸡、缝衣、磨面等，结果脱离了社员、组员的生产需要。有的地区没有抓住当地增产的关键，把各种可以利用的生产潜在力估计进去，使计划流于老一套。有的地区缺乏国家整体观念，订计划不按国家需要。长治专区曾错误地提出“什么多产，什么价大，就多种什么”。运城专区有些县只注意提高棉花产量，忽视增产小麦和其他粮食作物。
    山西省人民政府已指示各地对已订出的计划和正在订的计划都要反复地严格审查和修正。长治专署已审查各县计划，批判了计划中的缺点，并提出了具体的改进办法。（新华社）
    中共热河省平泉县委员会在今年春天派出工作组，深入农村调查农业生产潜在力，具体领导五十家子村农民订出增产计划。
    五十家子村是个年年增产的村子，到去年每垧地
    （合十五市亩）的平均产量已达到四千一百六十斤。该村农民在讨论制订今年的增产计划时，都有“增产到顶”的想法；中共支部副书记孙方也说：“保住年年增产，实在有困难。”中共平泉县委员会的工作组针对这种情绪，便从调查研究该村农业生产潜在力和推广当地丰产经验着手，让农民以生产好坏的实例展开讨论。如农民白健超和李有的田地土质一样，李有采用留苗办法，每垧收谷子一万斤以上，而白健超因为没有补全苗，每垧只收了二千多斤。农民们从事实中明白了当前挖掘农业生产潜在力，主要是充分利用地力的问题。工作组便根据当地农民改进耕作技术的要求，提出了实行“合理密植、等距全苗”的耕作法，并说明必须从抗旱保墒、适期播种、改良土壤、合理施肥、防治病虫害、洼地高作、山地低作等具体办法，来保证苗全苗旺。同时，工作组还把因“合理密植、等距全苗”而增产和因苗稀缺苗而减产的谷子、高粱等六种作物，做出对比模型，发动农民参观；举办丰产技术训练班，使一百多个农民学习了“合理密植、等距全苗”的耕作法。
    现在，五十家子村的农民生产热情很高，各个互助组和农业生产合作社都已订好增产计划。全村农民计划今年种的丰产田，要达到全部耕地的百分之四十二以上。（新华社）
