TASS, Moscow, March 8th: A telegram from Tsedenbal, Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic, to the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union:

    On behalf of the Mongolian people, the government of the Mongolian People's Republic, and myself, I express with infinite sorrow my deepest condolences to the Soviet government and the great Soviet people on the death of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the great leader and teacher of the Soviet people and working people of the world, the wise mentor and greatest friend of the Mongolian people, the beloved father of the Mongolian people, and our dearest Comrade Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.
    The herdsmen, workers, and intellectuals of the Mongolian People's Republic, and all the people, with the deepest grief in their hearts, join the fraternal Soviet people and the working people of the world in deeply mourning the death of Comrade J.V. Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's immortal cause, the genius who created and led the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the brilliant helmsman of communism, under whose leadership the Soviet people launched the great October Socialist Revolution, established the first socialist state in the world, defeated fascism and achieved a great victory, and made great achievements in building communism at home. The death of Comrade Stalin has deprived the working people of the Mongolian People's Republic of a wise leader, mentor, dear father, and the closest and most sincere friend.
    Comrade J.V. Stalin and the great Lenin jointly pointed out to the Mongolian people the true path to a happy and free life, helped them break the heavy shackles of foreign and domestic enslavers, and enabled them to make remarkable progress in the economic and cultural fields. All the achievements, happiness, and joyful life of the Mongolian people, and their free and independent existence, are due to Comrade Stalin's fatherly care for the welfare and happiness of our working people, to the fraternal assistance of the great Soviet people, and to the unbreakable and permanent friendship between the Soviet Union and Mongolia, of which the great Stalin was the organizer and inspirer. The name of Comrade Stalin is an incomparably dear name to the Mongolian people; every person in our country is filled with love for Comrade J.V. Stalin.
    In these sad days of mourning the great loss suffered by the fraternal Soviet people and all progressive humanity, including the Mongolian working people, the people of the Mongolian People's Republic unanimously declare their unwavering will and determination to further strengthen the unity and solidarity with the invincible Soviet Union, to remain forever faithful to the great and immortal cause of Lenin and Stalin, and to use every means to develop and strengthen their sacred and inviolable brotherly friendship with the great Soviet people, which is an inexhaustible source of happiness for our people. The indelible memory and shining image of Comrade J.V. Stalin will forever live in the hearts of the Mongolian people, inspiring them to fight for the great cause of peace, democracy, and socialism, for which our dearest leader and mentor Comrade J.V. Stalin selflessly gave his beautiful life.

TASS, Moscow, March 8th: Enver Hoxha, First secretary of the Central Committee, Albanian Labor Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Council of Ministers:

    Dear Comrades: The Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, the Party Central Committee, and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania learned with the deepest sorrow of the death of our people's friend, our glorious, brilliant father and mentor, the great Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the fraternal Soviet people, the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, and the progressive and peace-loving people of all countries, including our people and our Party, have lost a most beloved person, a respected teacher, a comrade-in-arms of the great Lenin and the first heir to his cause, a leader with a broad vision and an iron will who guided us along the path of peace, socialism, and communism. The members of the Albanian Labor Party and the workers, peasants, intellectuals, women, and youth of our country deeply mourn the loss of a great friend and mentor, because the liberation of the Albanian people from the oppression of internal and external enemies is inseparable from the name of Stalin, and because the construction of our new and happy life is inseparable from the name of Stalin.
    In these very difficult days, our Party and all our people swear to the great Comrade Stalin: that we will protect our Party as we protect the apple of our eye, and that we will further strengthen our love and loyalty to the dear Communist Party of the Soviet Union – the mother of the Soviet Union – and to the fraternal Soviet people. The Albanian people, under the leadership of the Labor Party, cherishing the name of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, will resolutely follow the path pointed out by our mentor, whom we will never forget, towards new victories. The Albanian people must unite around the Labor Party, the Party Central Committee, and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania; they must strengthen their spiritual and political unity, heighten their revolutionary vigilance, and resolutely smash all the conspiracies of the imperialist bloc and its lackeys against the people's freedom, independence, peace, and future. On behalf of the Albanian Labor Party and the Party Central Committee, on behalf of the People's Republic of Albania and all the Albanian people, and in my own name, I extend my deepest and most heartfelt condolences to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Government, and all the Soviet people. There is a strong and lasting fraternal friendship between the Albanian working people and the Soviet working people, and they will share this greatest misfortune with the Soviet people. Comrade Stalin will live forever in our hearts and forever in the hearts of our descendants. His great struggle, his Bolshevik irreconcilability, will be an example for us to be unyielding and unwavering in the face of any danger, and will be an example of victory. Eternal glory to the great Comrade Stalin! Long live the Soviet people, the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union – our savior!

    丹麦共产党中央委员会的唁电
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科八日电：丹麦共产党中央委员会致电苏联共产党中央委员会，吊唁约·维·斯大林逝世。电文如下：
    同志们！我们和你们同样为约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林同志的逝世感到非凡的沉痛。全世界人民和全世界工人阶级丧失了他们所深深感激的最伟大和最优秀的战士。斯大林同志在苏联建成了社会主义，他指出了过渡到共产主义的道路，把全体被压迫人类的希望变成了活生生的灿烂的现实。斯大林同志消灭了希特勒法西斯主义的致命威胁，保卫了自由，同时也使丹麦民族免于灭亡。斯大林同志领导了全体进步人类追求建立各民族自由平等地友好共处的世界的努力。他使人成为最宝贵的资本，他组织了人民保卫和平的斗争，也保卫了丹麦人民的切身利益。他号召人民自己担当起保卫和平的事业，并把它坚持到底，因而给了和平阵营以不可战胜的力量和威力。斯大林同志继承了列宁的事业。他更进一步发展了马克思—列宁主义的学说。他锻铸出武器，使被压迫的人民能够在工人阶级的共产党的领导下，利用这武器保证取得胜利，同时也为我们丹麦工人阶级树立了伟大的斗争的范例。伟大的人民领袖斯大林同志将永远活在人们的心里，我们所遭受的沉重损失，使我们更加紧密地团结我们的队伍，吸引新的人民群众加入争取和平、自由和社会主义的斗争。我们保证加倍努力，高举民主和民族独立的旗帜前进，使我们的国家摆脱战争和贫困，引导人民走向胜利。让人类的敌人知道，在不可战胜的列宁—斯大林的旗帜下将不断团结起新的巨大的力量，把斯大林同志不朽的事业一直进行到胜利。
