Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 1st — Another group of workers from the Xi'an Railway Transportation Bureau volunteered to go to the Korean front to participate in transportation work.

Thirty-five groups of workers from the Xi'an Railway Transportation Bureau have gone to Korea, and eighty-four of them have been commended for their meritorious service. This time, responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea," more than 300 workers requested to go to Korea to work. Because the front line was not urgently in need at the moment, the Northwest Headquarters for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea only agreed to allow 73 people, including Yang Jinhua, to go to Korea to work. They left Xi'an on February 21st to go to Korea. Before their departure, the Xi'an Railway Transportation Bureau, the Northwest Headquarters for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, and the Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City branches of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Association jointly held a farewell meeting at Xi'an Railway Station. While the farewell meeting was in progress, the old father and mother of Chen Jiafu, a worker from the Sanqiao Construction Factory engineering team who was going to Korea, rushed from Sanqiao to say goodbye. Old Mrs. Chen held her son's hand and said, "You are a good son to your mother. Go to Korea and earn more merit to protect our good life."

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 1st — The Chengdu Automobile Workers Volunteer Team to Korea, a group of thirty people, departed on February 27th to work on the Korean front. Before their departure, the Chengdu Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Association and people from all walks of life held a grand farewell evening.

    志愿到朝鲜参加运输工作
    【新华社西安一日电】西安铁路运输分局又有一批职工志愿到朝鲜前线参加运输工作。
    西安铁路运输分局先后赴朝工作的职工已有三十五批，其中已有八十四人立了功。这一次职工们响应毛主席“要加强抗美援朝的斗争”的伟大号召，要求到朝鲜去工作的就有三百多人。因为前线一时还不急需，西北抗美援朝总分会只同意杨锦华等七十三人前往朝鲜工作。他们已在二月二十一日离开西安前往朝鲜。行前西安铁路运输分局、西北抗美援朝总分会和陕西省、西安市抗美援朝分会，在西安车站联合举行欢送会。欢送会正在进行时，三桥建厂工程队赴朝职工陈嘉夫的老父亲和老母亲，由三桥赶来欢送。陈老太太握着儿子的手说：“你是妈的好儿子，到朝鲜要多多立功，保卫咱们的好光景。”
        【新华社成都一日电】成都市汽车工人志愿赴朝工作队一行三十人，已在二月二十七日出发赴朝鲜前线工作。行前，成都市抗美援朝分会和各界人民曾举行了盛大的欢送晚会。
