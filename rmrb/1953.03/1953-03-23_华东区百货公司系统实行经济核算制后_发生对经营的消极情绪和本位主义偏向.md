Following the implementation of the economic accounting system in the East China Department Store system, the heads of department stores in various regions, seeing a large backlog of inventory and limited funds, developed a "look at the money to purchase goods," "how much money to purchase how much goods," and even "have money but do not purchase goods" tendency to shrink back. Therefore, their planned orders were not actively based on accelerating capital turnover, planning timely purchases in conjunction with compressing inventory to expand supply, but rather starting from the subjective desire to compress funds, regardless of production conditions and market needs, adopting a "rather small than large" approach. In the January purchase plan of Shanghai City Company's affiliated department stores, only half a dozen shirts were ordered, not even one piece per store; the Xuzhou wholesale station only wanted seven Pacific bed sheets in January. Thus, their purchase plans had to be constantly revised, procurement and allocation work fell into chaos, and many goods were out of stock in the market. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station of China National Department Store received as many as three or four kinds of purchase plans from various places in January and February, such as "purchase plan," "supplementary plan," and "additional plan," making it impossible for the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station to carry out procurement and supply work in a planned manner. Some provincial and municipal wholesale stations, fearing the accumulation of goods, had no reasonable inventory at all, and requested as many goods as the department stores needed from the central wholesale station. Therefore, the provincial and municipal wholesale stations could not promptly supply the needs of the department stores. And some department stores treated the wholesale station as their warehouse, requesting goods at any time after they were sold out, some even without a purchase plan. The Nandao Department Store adopted the method of "daily purchase and daily sale, repurchase after selling out," purchasing goods from the wholesale station three or four times a day.

After the implementation of the economic accounting system, both stations and stores had their own fixed funds, and localism and capitalist management ideas grew. Some provincial and municipal wholesale stations kept the fast-selling goods for their own operation, and tried their best to push the slow-selling goods to the stores to sell. And the department stores also only wanted fast-selling and profitable goods, and did not actively promote the goods accumulated by the wholesale stations, thus constantly producing the phenomenon of accumulation on one side and out of stock on the other.济南 Jinan Department Store was short of goods before the Spring Festival, and a quarter of the shelves were empty, while the wholesale station had more than 300 kinds of goods that the department stores lacked in stock in the warehouse. Dezhou Department Store had been out of stock of Lvbao soap for a long time, and had requested goods from the wholesale station several times, but the wholesale station had a lot of Lvbao soap in the warehouse, but refused to give it, claiming that there was no stock, and finally secretly sold it all in its own store. When the economic accounting system was implemented, supply and sales contracts were signed between the wholesale stations and the department stores, but many stations and stores did not keep their promises and did not fulfill them due to localism, thus making the relationship between the stations and stores very uncoordinated. This phenomenon has attracted the attention of the local financial and economic leading organs. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 华东区百货公司系统实行经济核算制后  发生对经营的消极情绪和本位主义偏向

    华东区百货公司系统实行经济核算制后
    发生对经营的消极情绪和本位主义偏向
    华东区百货公司系统实行经济核算制后，各地百货商店的负责人看到库存积压很多，而资金又受到限制，产生了一种“看钱进货”、“有多少钱进多少货”，甚至“有钱也不进货”的缩手缩脚倾向。因此他们所订的计划不是积极地从加速资金周转，有计划地及时进货结合压缩库存出发，以扩大供应，而是不看生产条件与市场需要，单从压缩资金的主观愿望出发，采取“宁小毋大”的方针。上海市公司所各属百货商店一月份进货计划中衬衫只要半打，每一商店还分不到一件，徐州批发站一月份太平洋被单只要七条，这样他们的进货计划不得不不断修改，调拨采购工作陷于混乱，不少货物在市场上脱销。中国百货公司上海采购供应批发站一、二月份收到各地进货计划竟有“进货计划”、“补充计划”、“追加计划”等三四种之多，使上海采购供应批发站无法有计划地进行采购供应工作。有的省市批发站害怕积压商品，竟完全没有合理库存，百货商店要多少，便向中央批发站要多少，因此，省市批发站便不能及时供应百货商店的需要。而有些百货商店把批发站作为他们的仓库，随时销完随时要货，有的甚至连个要货计划也没有。南道百货商店采取“日购日销、销完再购”的办法，一天之内要向批发站购货三四次。
    在实行经济核算制后，站与店都各自核定资金，本位主义和资本主义经营思想滋长起来。有的省市批发站把好销的商品留下自己经营，不好销的尽量推给商店去卖。而百货商店也同样只要好销的、赚钱多的商品，对批发站积压的商品不积极推销，因此便不断产生一面积压，一面脱销的现象。济南市百货商店在春节前缺货很多，货架空了四分之一，而批发站却有三百多种百货商店所缺少的商品积压在仓库里。德州百货商店绿宝香皂脱销已久，曾几次向批发站要货，批发站有很多绿宝香皂在仓库里，却推说没有，最后竟偷偷地在自己的门市部全部卖掉了。在实行经济核算制时，批发站与百货商店之间都订了供销合同，但许多站与店因有本位主义，都不守信用，不予履行，因此使得站与店的关系很不协调。这一现象已引起各地财经领导机关的重视。（新华社）
