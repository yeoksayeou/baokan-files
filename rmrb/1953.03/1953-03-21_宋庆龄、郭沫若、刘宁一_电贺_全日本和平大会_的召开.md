    Soong Ching Ling, Guo Moruo, and Liu Ningyi
    Send Telegrams to Congratulate the Opening of the "All-Japan Peace Congress"
    [Xinhua News Agency, 20th] Soong Ching Ling, Chairman of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, sent a telegram on the 20th to congratulate the opening of the "All-Japan Peace Congress" to be held in Tokyo on the 21st. The telegram reads as follows: To the All-Japan Peace Congress:
    On behalf of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee and myself personally, I sincerely congratulate the opening of the "All-Japan Peace Congress." I wish the Congress great success, and that the friendship between the Japanese people and the peace-loving people of Asia, the Pacific region, and all countries of the world, and their efforts to strive for peace, will make the struggle for lasting peace in Asia, the Pacific, and the world increasingly broad and consolidated.

    [Xinhua News Agency, 20th] Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, sent a telegram on the 20th to congratulate the opening of the "All-Japan Peace Congress." The telegram reads as follows: To the All-Japan Peace Congress:
    We are delighted to learn that the "All-Japan Peace Congress" will be held in Tokyo on March 21st. On behalf of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, I wish the Congress victory and success. The American occupiers riding on the heads of the Japanese people have openly declared to the world, in their actions and words, that they want to expand the war of aggression against Korea, to spread the flames of war to the entire Asian and Pacific region, and have proclaimed that they will organize a Pacific aggressive bloc to achieve their despicable goals with the sinister policy of "using Asians to fight Asians." And rearming Japanese militarist forces is the core of this sinister war policy, and attempts to use the Japanese people as cannon fodder to realize it. We believe that the peace-loving Japanese people, who have suffered the trauma of war, will stand together with the people of all countries in Asia and the Pacific region to fight against the war policies and aggressive policies of American imperialism, to avoid being cannon fodder for the aggressors, and to strive for their own national independence and freedom.

    [Xinhua News Agency, 20th] Liu Ningyi, Secretary-General of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, sent a telegram on the 20th to congratulate the opening of the "All-Japan Peace Congress." The telegram reads as follows: To the All-Japan Peace Congress:
    On the eve of the opening of the "All-Japan Peace Congress," I sincerely wish the Congress victory and success. The Japanese people's peace struggle will surely give a powerful blow to the war-mongers' so-called "using Asians to fight Asians" sinister policy.
            Secretary-General of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee
    Liu Ningyi

    【新华社二十日讯】亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会主席宋庆龄在二十日致电祝贺将于二十一日在东京召开的“全日本和平大会”，电文如下：全日本和平大会：
    我谨代表亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会及我个人衷心祝贺“全日本和平大会”的召开。预祝大会获得巨大成就，日本人民与亚洲、太平洋区域以及全世界各国爱好和平人民之间的友谊和争取和平的努力将使亚洲、太平洋以及世界持久和平的斗争日益扩大和巩固。

    【新华社二十日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若在二十日电贺“全日本和平大会”的召开，电文如下：全日本和平大会：
    欣闻“全日本和平大会”将于三月二十一日在东京召开，我谨代表中国人民保卫世界和平委员会预祝大会的胜利和成功。骑在日本人民头上的美国占领者，在行动上和言论上，都已公开向全世界表示要扩大侵朝战争，要把战争的火焰蔓延到全亚洲和太平洋区域，并声言要组织太平洋侵略集团，以“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的罪恶政策来达到它的卑鄙目的。而重新武装日本军国主义势力，就是这个罪恶的战争政策的重心，并企图以日本人民当炮灰来实现它。我们相信，曾惨受战争创痛的爱好和平的日本人民，将和亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民在一起，为反对美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，为避免自己替侵略者当炮灰，为争取自己的民族独立自由而奋斗。
