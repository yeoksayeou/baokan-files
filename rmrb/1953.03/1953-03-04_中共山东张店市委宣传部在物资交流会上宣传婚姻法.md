    The Propaganda Department of the CPC Zhangdian Municipal Committee, Shandong Province Promotes the Marriage Law at a Materials Exchange Fair
    Wu Ming writes: The Propaganda Department of the CPC Zhangdian Municipal Committee, during the urban and rural materials exchange fair held in the city at the end of last December, set up a propaganda booth, focusing on promoting the Marriage Law. In addition to propagandists explaining the Marriage Law, the booth also displayed pictures related to the Marriage Law and the victory of Han Yumei, a female worker in the city's cotton weaving industry, in her fight for freedom of marriage. The propaganda lasted for eight days, with over 25,000 visitors.

    Through this publicity, the broad masses of people have further realized that the Marriage Law is indeed good. An old man with white hair said, "My marriage back then was like trying to lift tofu with a hemp rope – impossible! Matchmakers used sweet talk, and even if both parties didn't agree, they had to get married. Now, freely choosing a partner is truly a double happiness." An old woman surnamed Gao said, "I arranged the marriage for my eldest daughter, but they didn't get along, and they quarrel and fight every day. My daughter is constantly crying, and it makes me sad as a mother. I must let my youngest daughter find a partner freely and never stop her." The audience unanimously agreed that the Marriage Law has brought happiness to the vast number of young men and women, and this happiness was given by Chairman Mao, and they expressed their firm support for the Marriage Law.

    中共山东张店市委宣传部在物资交流会上宣传婚姻法
    吴明来信：中共山东张店市委员会宣传部在去年十二月底该市城乡物资交流大会上设了宣传棚，着重地宣传了婚姻法。宣传棚中，除有宣传员宣传婚姻法外，并展览了有关婚姻法的和本市棉织业女工韩玉美争取婚姻自由得到胜利的图片。宣传时间共八天，观众有二万五千多人。
    从这次宣传中，使广大群众进一步认识到婚姻法就是好。一位白发苍苍的老大爷说：“我那时的婚姻是马尾勒豆腐没法提了，媒婆花言巧语，双方不同意也得结婚，现在自由选择对象真是双喜。”高老大娘说：“我给我大女儿包办了婚事，双方不合，天天吵嘴打仗，女儿可哭流鼻子了，做娘的心里也难过。俺小女得叫她自由找对象，决不阻挡她。”观众一致认为婚姻法给广大男女青年带来了幸福，这种幸福是毛主席给的，并表示要坚决拥护婚姻法。
