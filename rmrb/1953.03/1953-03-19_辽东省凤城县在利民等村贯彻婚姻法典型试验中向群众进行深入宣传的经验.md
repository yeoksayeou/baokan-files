The Fengcheng County, Liaodong Province, has gained experiences in conducting in-depth propaganda to the masses during the pilot implementation of the Marriage Law in villages such as Limin and Lishu.

Before the pilot implementation of the Marriage Law in Limin and Lishu villages, the general situation of marriage relationships was as follows: on the one hand, many young men and women had gained marital freedom, and couples with extremely poor feelings had divorced; on the other hand, there were still many families with poor relationships, some with disharmonious couples, and some with disharmonious relationships between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. Among married couples, more than half of the men and women were in an unequal position, and some women were even frequently beaten and scolded.

After the news of carrying out the Marriage Law movement reached these two villages, the masses had some ideological concerns. The main manifestations were: 1. They believed that implementing the Marriage Law meant calling for divorce. For example, Li Dewen from Lishu Village said, "This time, the Marriage Law is being promoted, and my wife will 'fly' away!" 2. Unmarried young farmers mostly believed that after the implementation of the Marriage Law, "it will be difficult for farmers to find wives." 3. Many people, especially the elderly, believed that implementing the Marriage Law had nothing to do with them. 4. Some people believed that women "have already been elevated too much, and men are afraid to beat or scold them, so the Marriage Law should not be implemented any further." For example, He Yongchang from Limin Village said, "Women have already been elevated enough, and it will be even worse to promote the Marriage Law further!" 5. Those who violated the Marriage Law were uneasy. Xu Shengmo from Lishu Village, who had beaten and scolded his wife in the past, was asking around for information, asking village cadres whether those who had beaten their wives in the past would be prosecuted.

In view of this situation, the work team first gathered fifty cadres in the two villages for study, explained the Marriage Law, and corrected their various incorrect understandings of the Marriage Law; then they carried out propaganda to the masses. In the propaganda, various propaganda forces were organized, and various propaganda methods were adopted.

In order to dispel the ideological concerns of the masses, the policies were first explained to the masses in detail. For example, Jiang Futian remarried more than ten years ago, and now he was afraid of being punished, so the cadres talked to him and explained the policies specifically. After Jiang Futian understood the policies, he dispelled his worries about "being imprisoned by the court," and all four members of his family participated in the meeting to listen to the Marriage Law. After the masses initially understood the direction of this movement, the work team inspired and organized the masses to study the Marriage Law, so that the movement could go deeper. In order to adapt to the scattered situation in the mountainous areas and take care of the production of the masses, learning was generally organized by "ban" (forty to fifty households). Women studied during the day, and men studied at night. The work team explained the following five questions based on the articles of the Marriage Law: 1. What are the differences between the old and new marriage systems? 2. What is marital freedom? 3. What is equality between men and women? 4. How should the relationship between parents and children be? 5. How to deal with divorce issues (including the handling of property after divorce and the upbringing and education of children). During the study, the masses first raised questions, organized discussions, and finally made summaries. This method, which starts from the actual thoughts of the masses, has been very effective. Through the discussion of these issues, the ideological understanding of the masses has been gradually improved. For example, when talking about the differences between the old and new marriage systems, the masses combined the examples of their own villages, compared and contrasted the old and new marriage systems, and analyzed and criticized them, and initially distinguished the good and bad boundaries of the old and new marriage systems. But at this time, the masses still had some wrong views on other issues. For example, when discussing what is equality between men and women, the masses initially believed that "a cat catches mice, and a man is in charge," and men and women cannot be equal at all; if we talk about equality, then what men can do, women must also be able to do. Yang, an old lady from Limin Village, said, "Women have to rely on men to support them, this has been the case since ancient times." Therefore, the method of detailed accounting and household chores inspection was adopted, from the kang to the ground, such as raising children, cooking three meals a day, feeding pigs, pushing millstones, etc., to inspire men to discuss whether these household chores count as labor? Is it okay for men to work outside without women doing housework? After the detailed accounting, everyone was surprised. Some said, "Women's work is really not easy!" Some said, "I never thought that the work done by women was also labor!" Some also said, "Women's work is like meat buried in the pot, eaten with the rice, and no one saw it." Wang Deli from Limin Village used to beat his wife often. This time, after the discussion, it was midnight when he returned home. He woke up his wife and sincerely reviewed his actions to his wife, saying, "In the past, I made all the decisions alone and often beat you. I will change in the future." The next day, his wife happily narrated the changes in her husband at the women's representatives meeting. From then on, Wang Deli truly changed. He discussed everything with his wife and often helped his wife with some odd jobs. After this discussion, many men in the village changed their attitude towards being husbands. The atmosphere that helping wives with housework was shameful in the past has changed. The idea of male superiority and female inferiority was reversed for the first time. When discussing divorce issues, each village used local materials; the masses gained a correct view of divorce from the discussion of specific facts. For example, Fang Yusheng from Limin Village married Wu Shuzhen when he was young, and the relationship between the two was very bad after marriage. After the promulgation of the Marriage Law, with the approval of the court, the two divorced. At that time, Fang Yusheng was very dissatisfied, saying, "After liberation, I was given two mu of land, but I lost a wife!" In 1952, Fang Yusheng found his own partner, and the couple lived in harmony after marriage. During the discussion, he understood the truth, he said, "Without the Marriage Law, I could not have such a harmonious family." In the mass discussion, facts were also listed, and the masses specifically studied who met the divorce conditions or who did not meet the divorce conditions, so that the masses understood the truth that most old families could be transformed into new families. After the masses studied, twenty people canceled the marriage contracts that they had arranged for their children in the past.

After the masses in Limin Village studied the Marriage Law, they also held a village-wide typical report meeting. At the meeting, several people reported on the typical examples of their old families being changed into new families, striving for marital freedom and establishing happy families, voluntarily stopping interfering in their daughters' marriages, and being impoverished due to arranged marriages. Lishu Village also held a typical report meeting, and the masses also conducted informal discussions after the meeting. This method of education with vivid facts and comparisons between the old and the new has achieved good results.

The masses in Limin and Lishu villages generally spent seven days studying the Marriage Law. During this period, the movement deepened step by step, and the masses were enthusiastic from beginning to end. For example, Jiang Shuiming said, "The Marriage Law is so good!" Everywhere you could hear the masses talking about the Marriage Law. Those who studied the Marriage Law in Limin Village accounted for more than 90% of the population over the age of fifteen in the village, and in Lishu Village, it accounted for more than 85%. Other masses also received an education on the Marriage Law because activists adopted a contracted method.

    辽东省凤城县在利民等村贯彻婚姻法典型试验中向群众进行深入宣传的经验
    辽东省凤城县在利民、梨树等村进行贯彻婚姻法典型试验工作中，取得了向群众进行深入宣传的经验。
    利民、梨树二村在进行贯彻婚姻法典型试验工作之前，婚姻关系的大体情况是：一方面不少青年男女获得了婚姻自由，夫妇感情十分恶劣的已离婚；另方面还有很多家庭关系不好，有的夫妇不和，有的婆媳不和。已婚夫妇，有半数以上男女处于不平等地位，有的妇女甚至经常挨打挨骂。
    开展贯彻婚姻法运动的消息传到这两个村以后，群众产生了一些思想顾虑。主要表现是：一、认为贯彻婚姻法就是号召离婚。如梨树村的李德文说：“这回来宣传婚姻法，我老婆可要‘飞’啦！”二、未婚青年农民，多认为实行婚姻法以后，“庄稼人就不易找到媳妇”。三、不少人特别是老年人认为贯彻婚姻法与自己无关。四、有些人认为妇女“已经提得太高了，男人已不敢打不敢骂，不应再贯彻婚姻法了。”如利民村的何永昌说：“现在妇女已经提得够高了，再宣传婚姻法就更糟啦！”五、违反婚姻法的就惶惶不安。梨树村的徐盛模，过去打骂过老婆，他到处打听消息，问村干部过去打老婆的是不是要法办。
    根据这种情况，工作组先在两个村集中了五十名干部进行学习，讲解婚姻法，纠正他们对婚姻法的各种不正确认识；然后向群众进行宣传。在宣传中，组织了各种宣传力量，采用了各种宣传方式。
    为了解除群众的思想顾虑，首先向群众详细交代了政策。如姜福田在十多年前重婚，现在怕受处分，干部就找他谈话，具体交代政策。姜福田懂得政策后，打消了“怕蹲法院”的顾虑，全家四口人都参加开会，听讲婚姻法。在群众初步懂得这次运动的方针后，工作组又启发和组织群众学习婚姻法，使运动深入一步。为适应山区分散的情况和照顾群众的生产，一般都是以板（四、五十户）为单位组织学习。白天妇女学习，晚上男子学习。工作组根据婚姻法条文讲解以下五个问题：一、新旧婚姻制度有什么不同？二、什么叫婚姻自由？三、什么叫男女平等？四、父母子女之间的关系应该怎样才对？五、怎样处理离婚问题（包括离婚后财产的处理和对子女的抚养、教育等）。学习中，先由群众提出问题，组织讨论，最后做总结。这种从群众实际思想出发的办法，收效很大。通过这几个问题的讨论，把群众的思想认识逐步提高起来。如讲新旧婚姻制度有什么不同时，群众结合本村的事例，对比新旧婚姻制度，分析批判，初步分清了新旧婚姻制度的好坏界限。但这时群众在其他问题上仍有些错误看法。如在讨论什么叫男女平等时，开始群众认为：“是猫就捕鼠，是男人就做主”，男女根本不能平等；若讲平等，就得男的干什么，妇女也得能干什么。利民村杨老太太说：“女的就得靠男的养活，这是自古以来的事情。”于是采取算细账、查家务的办法，从炕上算到地下，如抚养孩子、一天做三顿饭、喂猪、推碾拉磨等，启发男人讨论这些家务事算不算劳动？男人在外面干活，没有妇女给做家务事行不行？经过算细账，大家都吃了一惊。有人说：“妇女的活真不轻呀！”有的说：“过去没想到妇女干的那些活也是劳动！”也有的说：“妇女的活就像肉埋在锅里，随饭吃下去了，谁也没看见。”利民村的王德礼过去经常毒打老婆，这次讨论完回家时已到半夜，他叫醒老婆，诚恳地向老婆检讨说：“过去什么事都是我一个人做主，也常打你，以后我要改过。”第二天他老婆在妇女代表会上，高兴地叙述丈夫的转变。从此以后，王德礼真正转变了，有事便和老婆商量，也经常帮助老婆做些零活。经过这次讨论，村里有不少男人对做丈夫的态度都有了转变。过去一向被认为帮助老婆干活是可耻的空气改变了。男尊女卑的思想第一次被扭转过来。讨论离婚问题时，各村都是就地取材；群众从具体事实的讨论中，对离婚有了正确的看法。如利民村的方玉升，从小和吴淑珍结婚，婚后两人感情很坏。婚姻法颁布后，经法院批准，两人离了婚。当时方玉升很不满意，说：“解放后分了二亩地，倒搭上个老婆！”一九五二年，方玉升自己找到对象，结婚后夫妇很和睦。在讨论中，他懂得了这道理，他说：“没有婚姻法，我不能有这样和睦的家庭。”在群众讨论中，也列举出事实，由群众具体地研究谁够离婚条件或谁不够离婚条件，使群众懂得了多数旧家庭可以改造成为新家庭的道理。群众学习之后，就有二十个人取消了过去包办子女婚姻的婚约。
    利民村群众在学习婚姻法后，还开了一次全村典型报告大会。在会上，几个人分别报告了自己的旧家庭改变成新家庭，争取婚姻自由建立幸福家庭，自动停止干涉女儿婚事，以及因包办婚姻而倾家荡产的典型事例。梨树村也召开了一次典型报告大会，会后群众还进行了漫谈。这种以活生生的事实、新旧对比的教育方法，收到很好的效果。
    利民、梨树二村群众学习婚姻法，大致都用了七天时间。在这期间，运动步步深入，群众自始至终情绪饱满。如姜水明说：“婚姻法太好啦！”到处都可以听见群众谈论婚姻法的事情。利民村学习婚姻法的，占全村十五岁以上人口的百分之九十以上，梨树村占百分之八十五以上。其他的群众，也因为积极分子采取了包干的办法，受到了一次婚姻法的教育。
