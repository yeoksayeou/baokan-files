Local postal and telecommunications departments are continuing to conduct in-depth inspections and correct deviations in business operations in conjunction with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline. In the past month, thanks to the strengthened leadership of local party committees over postal and telecommunications departments, most units have been able to conduct reviews from top to bottom and criticisms from bottom to top, continuing to expose many errors of coercion and illegal and undisciplined behavior committed by postal and telecommunications departments and personnel in the so-called development of special services. For example, in order to promote the sale of newspapers and periodicals in large quantities, the Laishui County Post and Telecommunications Bureau contacted the county government, which issued a notice stipulating that large villages should subscribe to five copies of newspapers, medium-sized villages three copies, and small villages two copies. In order to promote the "Young Pioneer Newspaper," the Boye Post and Telecommunications Bureau had a postal worker in a primary school stipulate that senior students should subscribe to one copy each, and intermediate students two students one copy. Staff at the Xiafangqiao postal agency in Zhejiang Province told landlords under control: "If you subscribe to the newspaper, one of your crimes will be reduced; if you don't subscribe, one of your crimes will be added." In some places, in order to force the masses to subscribe to newspapers, they also adopted some rude methods that violated human rights. On the one hand, there was forced apportionment, and on the other hand, due to bureaucratic work styles, a large number of newspapers and periodicals were backlogged. In the past two years, the postal and telecommunications departments in Ding County, Hebei Province, have had more than 6,200 copies of journals backlogged; the Xugezhuang Post and Telecommunications Bureau has had more than 5,000 copies of journals backlogged, and one postal worker in Tong County has had more than 2,000 copies of newspapers and periodicals backlogged; the Fushun Post and Telecommunications Bureau had more than 5,500 copies of various publications backlogged in November last year alone. Such phenomena of backlog and waste of newspapers and periodicals are common throughout the country. In addition, because newspaper subscriptions are often not voluntary, many newspaper fees cannot be recovered, resulting in great losses and waste. The Sixian Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Anhui Province used coercive methods to develop 1,700 newspaper subscribers in three months, but most of the newspapers were useless, and the masses owed 47 million yuan in newspaper fees, which have not been recovered to this day. In Liuan County, the province, an average of 20 million yuan in newspaper fees is owed per district. According to preliminary inspection, the total amount of newspaper fees unrecoverable in Anhui Province alone is more than 1 billion yuan.
	The deviations and errors of the postal and telecommunications departments are widespread and serious, but some leading cadres of postal and telecommunications bureaus still do not have sufficient understanding of the serious errors they have committed. Some believe that "the problem is not big," while others emphasize that "there are many tasks and a lot of work, and there is no time for inspection," and some are afraid that after correcting the deviations, they will "not be able to complete the tasks." On the other hand, new deviations have occurred in individual units, forcing "contractions," making it impossible for those who want to subscribe to newspapers and periodicals to do so.

    各地邮电部门在检查发展业务的偏向中
    继续揭发强迫命令和违法乱纪行为
    全国各地邮电部门正结合反对官僚主义，反对命令主义和反对违法乱纪的斗争，继续深入检查和纠正在业务经营中的偏向。在最近一个月以来，由于各地党委加强了对邮电部门的领导，因此大部分单位都能做到从上到下进行检讨和由下而上地展开批评，继续揭发了很多邮电部门和邮电工作人员在所谓发展特种业务中发生的强迫命令和违法乱纪的错误。如涞水县邮电局为了大量推销报刊，曾与该县县政府接洽，由县政府出通知，规定大村要订报五份，中等村订三份，小村订二份。博野邮电局为了推销“少年报”，曾有一邮工在一座小学校里规定高级生每人订一份，中级生两人订一份。浙江省下方桥邮政代办所的工作人员对被管制的地主分子说：“你如订报就罪减一条，不订报就罪加一条。”有的地方，为了强迫群众订报，还采用了一些侵犯人权的蛮横的办法。 一方面是强迫摊派，另一方面，又由于官僚主义的作风，使大批报刊被积压了。河北省定县邮电部门两年多来，积压期刊六千二百多本；胥各庄邮电局积压期刊五千多份，通县一个邮工就积压了两千多份报刊；抚顺邮电局在去年十一个月中，就积压各种刊物五千五百多册。像这样积压和浪费报刊的现象，全国各地普遍存在。此外，因为在订报时往往不是出于群众自愿，因而有很多的报费迟迟不能收回，损失和浪费也很大。安徽省泗县邮电局曾在三个月中，用强迫命令的方法发展了一千七百个报纸订户，结果大部分报纸都不起作用，群众欠报费四千七百万元，到现在都收不回来。该省六安县平均每区欠报费二千万元。据初步检查，仅安徽全省收不回的报费就有十多亿元。
    邮电部门的偏向和错误是普遍而严重的，但是现在还有些邮电局的领导干部对自己所犯的严重错误认识不足，有的认为“问题不大”，有的强调“任务多，工作忙，没有时间检查”，有的怕纠正偏向后就“完不成任务”。而另一方面，又有个别单位发生了新的偏向，强迫“收缩”，使愿意订购报刊的人订不到。
