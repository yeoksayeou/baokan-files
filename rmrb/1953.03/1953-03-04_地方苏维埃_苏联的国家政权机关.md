    Local Soviets – State Power Organs of the Soviet Union
    Soviet Union　En. Liepulov
    The local Soviets of Workers' Deputies, recently elected throughout the Soviet Union, are the most numerous and mass-based state power organs in the Soviet Union. The magnitude of the election campaign is evident from the fact that over 1.5 million deputies are to be elected. In more than 82,000 regions, districts, cities, villages, and settlements across all Soviet Republics, Soviet deputies will be elected.

    The working people of the Soviet Union actively participate in the preparations for the elections. Approximately seven million people are working solely in the election committees for the local Soviet elections. More than ten million propagandists, agitators, and other activists are working in the election districts, holding discussions with voters, etc. Tens of millions of workers, peasants, and intellectuals are participating in preparatory election meetings. From this, it can be seen that the election movement genuinely absorbs the broad masses of working people in state management and will further improve the work of the local organs of state power.

    Local Soviets play a significant role in the task of building communism. They lead local economic and cultural construction, formulate local budgets, lead subordinate organs, maintain state order, promote the strengthening of national defense, and safeguard the rights of citizens.

    The Communist Party and the Soviet government have consistently shown tireless concern for maximizing the satisfaction of the Soviet people's ever-growing needs, both in the past and present, because the welfare and prosperity of the Soviet people are the highest principles of the Lenin-Stalin Party. The task stipulated by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is to ensure the continuous improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people based on the continuous development of the entire national economy.

    The realization of this task is the main task of all activities of the local Soviets. At the same time, they possess the necessary material foundation and funds to realize this task. According to the 1952 Soviet national budget, the expenditure of local budgets was stipulated to be approximately 68.4 billion rubles. This huge amount of funds is primarily used for national education, healthcare, further improvement of equipment in urban and rural areas and villages, development of local industry and agriculture, and other needs.

    According to the Soviet Fifth Five-Year Plan, the state's capital construction funds for residential buildings will increase to approximately twice that of the Fourth Five-Year Plan. The plan is to significantly expand the network of commercial enterprises, hospitals, children's institutions, cinemas, libraries, and clubs, and to improve the work of factories supplying the people with daily consumer goods. All of this work is basically led by the local Soviets. Concern for the continuous development and improvement of local industry is an important function of the local Soviets. During the Five-Year Plan period, the output of local industries and industrial cooperative enterprises must increase by approximately 60 percent, primarily increasing the production of daily necessities, household goods, and local building materials. The development of agriculture occupies a significant position in the economic organizational activities of the state, regional, and village Soviets. Local Soviets will fight for the further improvement of agriculture and public animal husbandry to produce abundant food and raw materials.

    The directives of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan for Development stipulated a great new upsurge in the people's cultural level. It is projected that by the end of the fifth year, the seven-year education system will be completely transformed into a universal secondary education system (ten-year system) in the capitals of each republic, municipalities directly under the republic, states, border regions, and large industrial centers, and conditions will be prepared for implementing universal secondary education (ten-year system) in other cities and villages during the next five-year plan period. At the same time, it is necessary to begin implementing technical education in middle schools and take the necessary measures for transitioning to the implementation of universal technical education. The realization of these tasks is one of the most important responsibilities of the local Soviets.

    Local Soviets are also directly responsible for successfully implementing the instructions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the construction of housing and municipal enterprises, and the expansion of hospitals, clinics, nurseries, sanatoriums, rest homes, kindergartens, and childcare centers.

    All of this demonstrates the enormous scale of the work carried out by local Soviets in the national economy and culture. Local Soviets rely on the broad masses of working people to carry out all their activities.

    Comrade Stalin said: "Where does the strength of our state apparatus lie? It lies in the fact that it combines power with millions of workers and peasants through the Soviets. It lies in the fact that the Soviets are a school for millions of workers and peasants to learn management. It lies in the fact that the state apparatus is not isolated from millions of people, but is integrated with the people through many mass organizations, various specialized committees, various departments, various meetings, delegate meetings, and other organizations that surround the Soviets and support the organs of power." (Stalin's Collected Works, Vol. 10, p. 320)

    Local Soviets primarily establish contact with the broad masses of working people through their deputies. In December 1950, approximately 1.5 million deputies—outstanding representatives of workers, peasants, and intellectuals—were elected into the local Soviets.

    Local Soviet deputies regularly report to their voters. The voters expose shortcomings in the work of individual deputies and local Soviets and make suggestions on how to eliminate these shortcomings. The executive committees of the local Soviets have the responsibility to take effective measures to implement the suggestions made by voters aimed at improving the work of the Soviets. The deputies inform the voters about the results of the implementation of the suggestions made by the voters.

    The standing committees of the Soviets are indispensable assistants in the work of the Soviets, and millions of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals actively participate in the work of the standing committees.

    The election of local Soviets is conducted on the basis of the most democratic constitution in the world—the Stalin Constitution. This election is the only truly free and truly democratic election. What is important is not only that this election is universal, equal, secret, and direct—although this in itself is of great significance; what is important is that this election is the freest and most democratic election, first and foremost, because there are no capitalists or landlords in the Soviet Union, and the system of exploitation and wage labor has been eliminated. In the Soviet Union, elections are held under the conditions of the political and moral unity of the Soviet people, and under the conditions of mutual love, trust, and cooperation among workers, peasants, and intellectuals, who are closely united around the leading force of Soviet society—the Lenin-Stalin Party.

    The local organs of state power in the Soviet Union are fundamentally different from the so-called local "autonomous" organs in capitalist countries. In capitalist countries, local "autonomy" is an appendage of the bourgeois state machine that is opposed to the people. It has no power to influence its governors, local officials, and government commissioners; on the contrary, these people have the power to overturn any decisions of the "autonomous" organs. How pitiful is such "autonomy"! The urban economy, like the entire economy of the bourgeois state, is entirely controlled by the capitalists.

    In capitalist countries, the election of local "autonomous" organs, like the election of state power organs, is a scene of rampant reactionaries. The bourgeoisie not only uses various restrictions to exclude the broad masses of working people from participating in elections, but also takes all kinds of terrorist measures to coerce voters, slander progressive candidates, and even falsify election results. Basically, the American local "autonomous" organs, composed of misers, are helping the central organs of power to fascistize national life.

    Comrade Stalin, at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, explained the internal situation of various capitalist countries and the increasing intensification of reactionary forces, saying: "The banner of bourgeois democratic freedoms has been thrown aside. I believe that it is you, the representatives of the communist and democratic parties, who must raise this banner, move forward with this banner, if you want to gather the majority of the people around you. No one else but you will raise this banner."

    The election of local Soviets, like the election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Supreme Soviets of the Union Republics, is a process in which the Communist Party forms a close alliance with non-Party members, workers, peasants, and intellectuals. Stalin's alliance of Party and non-Party members has demonstrated its great strength. It is a manifestation of the unbreakable spiritual and political unity of Soviet society.

    The local Soviet elections held in the Soviet Union will surely promote the further consolidation of the local organs of state power and the improvement of their economic organization and cultural and educational work.

    地方苏维埃——苏联的国家政权机关
    苏联　恩·列普洛夫
    最近在苏联全国各地举行选举的地方劳动者代表苏维埃，是苏联最多数的、最带群众性的国家政权机关。从即将选举一百五十多万名代表这一事实，即可见选举运动规模的巨大了。在所有苏维埃共和国的八万二千多个边区、专区、区、城市、乡村和村镇里，都将选举出苏维埃代表。
    苏联劳动人民积极地参加选举的筹备工作。仅在选举地方苏维埃的选举委员会中就约有七百万人在工作着。有一千多万名鼓动员、宣传员及其他积极分子在选举区工作，和选民举行座谈会等。有数千万名工人、农民、知识分子参加筹备选举大会。由此可见，选举运动是真正吸收广大劳动群众参加国家管理，并将进一步改善国家政权地方机关的工作。
    在实行共产主义建设的任务中，地方苏维埃具有巨大的作用。它们领导着本地的经济和文化建设，制订地方预算，领导所属机关，维持国家秩序，促进国家国防力量的增强，以及维护公民权利。
    共产党和苏联政府对最大限度地满足苏联人民经常增长的需要，在过去和现在都表示出不倦的关怀，因为苏联人民的福利和苏联人民的繁荣，是列宁斯大林党的最高准绳。苏联共产党第十九次代表大会规定的任务是：在整个国民经济不断发展的基础上，保证继续不断提高苏联人民生活的物质与文化水平。
    实现这个任务——是地方苏维埃全部活动中的主要任务。同时它们拥有为了实现这一任务所必需的物质基础和资金。按一九五二年苏联国家预算来看，地方预算的开支曾规定约六百八十四亿卢布。这项巨额资金首先用在国民教育、保健，进一步改善城乡和村镇的设备，地方工农业的发展以及其他需用上面。
    按照苏联第五个五年计划，国家在住宅建筑方面的基本建设基金将增加为第四个五年计划的两倍左右。计划要显著地扩大商业企业、医院、儿童机关、电影院、图书馆和俱乐部网，并要改善供应人民日常生活消费品的工厂的工作。所有这些工作，基本上是由地方苏维埃来领导的。对地方工业不断发展和完善的关心，是地方苏维埃的重要职能。在五年计划时期内，地方工业和工业合作社企业的产量，必须增加百分之六十左右，首先是增产日用品、家常用品和地方建筑材料。在州的、专区的和乡村的苏维埃的经济组织活动中，农业的发展占有重大地位。地方苏维埃将为进一步提高农业和公有畜牧业而进行斗争，以便生产丰足的粮食和原料。
    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会关于苏联发展第五个五年计划的指示，规定人民文化水平的巨大新高涨。预定到第五年年底，在各共和国首都、共和国直辖市、州、边疆区和大工业的中心，把七年制教育完全改为普及中等教育（十年制教育），并为下
    一个五年计划期间，在其他的城市和乡村中实行普及中等教育（十年制教育）准备条件。同时必须开始在中学校内实行技术教育，并为过渡到实行普遍技术教育而采取必要的措施。实现这些任务乃是地方苏维埃最重要的职责之一。
    地方苏维埃在顺利执行苏联共产党第十九次代表大会关于建设住宅和市政企业、关于扩大医院、诊疗所、养育院、疗养院、休养所、幼儿园和托儿所等的指示上，也同样负有直接责任。
    所有这些即可证明地方苏维埃在国民经济与文化方面所进行的工作的巨大规模。地方苏维埃依靠着广大劳动群众，进行自己所有的全部活动。
    斯大林同志说：“我们国家机关的力量何在呢？就在于它经过苏维埃把政权和千百万工农群众结合起来。就在于苏维埃是供千百万工人和农民群众学习管理的学校。就在于国家机关不是与千百万民众隔绝，而是经过许许多多群众团体、各种专门委员会、各种部科、各种会议、代表会以及其他各种环绕着苏维埃并以此支持着政权机关的组织来与民众溶成一片。”（斯大林全集第十卷第三二○页）
    地方苏维埃首先通过自己的代表来和广大劳动群众建立联系。在一九五零年十二月，曾约有一百五十万名代表——工人、农民和知识分子的优秀代表被选入地方苏维埃内。
    地方苏维埃代表经常向选民作报告。选民们揭露个别的代表和地方苏维埃工作中的缺点，并提出关于消除这些缺点的建议。地方苏维埃执行委员会有责任对执行旨在改进苏维埃工作的选民所提出的建议采取有效措施。代表们把关于选民提出的建议执行结果通报给他们。
    苏维埃的常设委员会是苏维埃在工作中的不可缺少的助手，有数百万工人、集体农民和知识分子积极参加常设委员会的工作。
    选举地方苏维埃是在世界上最民主的宪法——斯大林宪法的基础上来进行的。这个选举是唯一真正自由的和真正民主的选举。重要的并不在于这个选举是普遍、平等、不记名和直接的选举——虽然这
    一点本身也有巨大的意义；重要的是这个选举之所以是最自由和最民主的选举，首先就是因为在苏联国内没有资本家，没有地主，消灭了剥削和雇佣劳动的制度。在苏联国内，选举是在苏联人民政治上和道义上统一的情况下举行的，是在紧密地团结在苏维埃社会的领导力量——列宁斯大林党的周围的工人、农民、知识分子的互相友爱、信任与合作的情况下举行的。
    苏联的国家政权地方机关是和各资本主义国家的所谓地方“自治”机关根本不同的。在资本主义国家中，地方“自治”是与人民对立的资产阶级国家机器的附属品，它没有任何权力来左右它的州长、地方官吏和政府专员们；相反，这些人却有权取消“自治”机关的任何决定。像这样的“自治”，够多么可怜啊！城市经济也和资产阶级国家所有的经济一样，全是操纵在资本家们手中的。
    在各资本主义国家里，选举地方“自治”机关也和选举国家政权机关一样，都是反动派在那里横行。资产阶级不仅用各种限制来排除广大劳动群众参加选举，并且还采取一切恐怖手段，胁迫选民，对进步的候选人造谣中伤，甚至伪造选举结果。基本上，由守财奴们所组成的美国地方“自治”机关帮助着中央政权机关把国家生活法西斯化。
    斯大林同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上，阐明各资本主义国家内部情况和反动势力日形加剧时说：“资产阶级民主的自由这面旗帜已经被抛在一边了。我认为，正是你们，共产主义和民主的政党的代表们，必须举起这面旗帜，打着这面旗帜前进，如果你们愿意把大多数人民集合在自己周围的话。除了你们以外，再没有人会举起这面旗帜了。”
    选举地方苏维埃也和选举苏联最高苏维埃、加盟共和国最高苏维埃一样，共产党是和非党人士、工人、农民、知识分子紧密地组成了联盟的。斯大林的党与非党联盟表明了自己的伟大力量。它是苏维埃社会牢不可破的精神与政治统一的表现。
    在苏联国内举行的地方苏维埃选举定会促进国家政权地方机关的进一步巩固及其经济组织和文化教育工作的改进。
