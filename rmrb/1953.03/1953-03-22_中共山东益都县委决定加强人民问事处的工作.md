The Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee forwarded a letter from the Yidu County Committee: In the letter published in the People's Daily on December 6th of last year regarding "Serious Suppression of Mass Criticism by Certain County and District Cadres in Shandong Province," criticism was made of the bureaucratic attitude of the Inquiry Office of our County Committee towards Comrade Wang Yiting, a member of the reading group in Tangzi Village, Fifteenth District. After inspection, we found that we had not paid enough attention to the work of the Inquiry Office in the past, and did not assign a dedicated person to work in the Inquiry Office, but instead had the transportation team take turns on duty. Furthermore, our education of the transport personnel was very poor, and some transport personnel had a bad attitude towards inquirers. Some people came to the County Committee to talk to comrades in various departments, but because no one was in those departments at the time, the transport personnel sent them back. Comrade Wang Yiting came three times and was turned away in this way each time. We have made a face-to-face self-criticism to Comrade Wang Yiting and decided to select comrades with a good mass perspective to work in the Inquiry Office so that similar incidents will not occur in the future.

    中共山东益都县委决定加强人民问事处的工作
    中共中央山东分局转来益都县委来信：人民日报去年十二月六日刊登关于“山东省某些县、区干部严重压制群众批评”的来信中，批评了我县县委机关的问事处对待十五区堂子村读报组员王义亭同志的官僚主义态度。经检查，过去我们对问事处的工作重视不够，未设专人作问事处工作，而由交通班轮班值日；而我们对交通员的教育也很差，有个别交通员对问事者态度不好，有的群众到县委来找各部门同志谈话，因当时各该部门无人，交通员就让他们回去。王义亭同志来了三次，都是这样被支走的。我们已向王义亭同志当面作了检讨，并决定挑选群众观念好的同志作问事处的工作，使今后不再有类此事件发生。
