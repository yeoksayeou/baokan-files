Radiant Youth
    ——On a Group of University Students Who Came to Anshan Last Year to Participate in Construction
    Ai Zhi
    Between August and September last year, among the more than 1,300 university students who came to the steel capital of Anshan to participate in construction, many people received letters of care and inquiry every day – inquiring whether they were dedicating the light and heat of their youth to the construction of the steel capital, and caring whether their every move was in line with the identity of a new Chinese technician. I don't know if these letter writers have received satisfactory answers, but I think, as a reporter, I have an obligation to tell those letter writers, and all those who care about them. In order to fulfill this obligation, I visited almost every construction site and office where they worked. During the visits, I interviewed leading cadres and workers, as well as many of them. The common answer these visits gave me was: they dedicated the light and heat of their youth in the construction of the steel capital, and they proved that they were qualified as new Chinese technicians with their actions of deeply loving the construction of the motherland. Before describing how they are working, I would like to let everyone hear the workers' comments on them first.

    Brave, simple, and versatile workers are reluctant to give praise to anyone easily, but they are very generous to these new Chinese university students. In the more than ten departments I visited, workers in almost every department said to me: "These university students are good! Almost every one of them is active and hardworking!" They not only said this to me, but also often wrote similar praises on their blackboards or proclaimed them loudly on the radio. Some workers even put their praises into the pockets of these university students. For example, Lin Junliang, who came from Sichuan's North Sichuan University, had such a letter from a worker in his pocket: "Your work is active and hardworking, you can integrate with us, and you can also teach us technology. We are going to leave the construction site temporarily to study, so we especially express our gratitude to you!"

    What did they, these new Chinese university students, use to obtain this simple and noble praise and care from the workers? In a word, they used their noble character of loving the people's construction cause, and the selfless spirit of work that arose from it. Now let me start with Comrade Wang Zelin, who is sick in the hospital, and talk about how they treat and engage in the work assigned to them by the people!

    Comrade Wang Zelin graduated from the Department of Metallurgy of Shenyang Institute of Technology in August last year. His specific job after arriving in Anshan was to apprentice steelmaking in the steelmaking plant, so that he could participate in the construction of the new steelmaking plant in the future. As soon as this young man arrived at the steelmaking plant, he immediately became fascinated by this work. In order to gain more time for work and study, from the day he went to work, he always bought steamed buns the night before, got up at four o'clock the next morning, and walked to the factory while eating on the road. Later, others advised him to pay attention to his health and not ruin his body, but he always believed: "People who love work will not be tired!" But at the end of last year, he finally fell ill in the hospital due to overwork. But even sick in the hospital could not make him forget his work. On January 6, because he could not bear the pain of temporarily leaving his work, he wrote a letter to his partners saying:

        "I often think it's best not to have night, because it will take away our working time. When apprenticing on site, in order to gain more time for work and study, I always got up at four o'clock in the morning, then took cold steamed buns and walked to the factory while eating. I think I should dedicate everything to the construction of the steel capital. But now I am sick, which is so unfortunate!
    "However, illness cannot make me forget work and study. Lying in bed, I often think about work while taking medicine. As soon as I think about work, I think of the dark crowd, rushing into the construction site or factory together when the whistle sounds.

    "I envy you being able to work. I don't want to leave the work assigned to me by the motherland for a moment. But the illness forces me to leave it temporarily, comrades, think about it, how unfortunate this is!"

    Friends, is this a letter? No, this is a ball of youthful fire. Through it, we can not only see Wang Zelin's radiant youth and the noble character of deeply loving the national construction cause that shines on him at all times, but also see the radiant youth of them – these new Chinese university students. Wang Zelin is one of the representatives of these young people.

    On the construction site in Anshan, I visited many of them. During the visits, I found that almost everyone stipulated a special work discipline for themselves: "Only allow to do the work well, not allow to do the work badly!" Therefore, occasionally making a mistake due to insufficient proficiency in work became the most difficult thing for them. Of course, this kind of sadness is not out of the morbid self-esteem of the petty bourgeoisie, but out of a high sense of responsibility to the people's cause. Apprentice technician Zong Fuyu is an example.

    Zong Fuyu is a student from Beijing Railway Institute, 23 years old this year, a very decisive and strong young man. According to him, he has never shed tears since he was twelve or thirteen years old. But after he arrived at the construction site of the Anshan Large Rolling Mill, he shed tears because he did not do a good job. The thing is like this: on the morning of October 6 last year, as soon as Zong Fuyu went to work, he heard that the excavator had encountered huge concrete blocks in the excavation, so it could no longer dig. At that time, he was very anxious, because he knew that an excavator stopping for a few hours was equivalent to a hundred people doing one day less of work. So he hurriedly asked for more than a hundred temporary workers to attack and excavate the concrete blocks. Who knew that he had not used even half of the workers after he brought them to the site. At this time, some workers criticized him: "Waste!" Following this criticism, Zong Fuyu shed tears for the first time. Why did the always strong Zong Fuyu shed tears at this time? Was it because he lost his inherent strong character in the face of criticism? No, please look at his diary that day: "I think wasting the people's wealth is a crime. Today, the waste caused by my inconsideration makes me feel very painful. This pain made me shed tears for the first time!" From the day he arrived at the construction site, Zong Fuyu treated every job with such an attitude, and was therefore selected as one of the advanced workers by the comrades in his work section.

    I can say without exaggeration that people like Wang Zelin and Zong Fuyu account for the vast majority among them. Once, I asked Comrade Li Xipei, the deputy section chief of the Ironmaking Section of the Design Office: "How are the university students working in your section?" He replied without hesitation: "Good! Although they have only been here for less than half a year, they have now become the backbone of our section." Then he told me about the work of Huang Zhanshi, Li Jingxi and other five people, saying: "Almost all of them are working very well." Finally, I asked him again:

    "How many university students who came in August and September last year are there in your section?" He said: "Not many, just six!" I have conducted similar visits many times, but the answers I got were the same. From these visits, I saw that the noble character of loving the people's cause has grown up universally in these young people.

        This new character has won them people's praise, rapid progress in technology, and a real life. An old engineer told me in a surprised tone: "Li Jingxi, a university student apprenticing at the ironmaking plant, is really amazing! He learned to master the operation of an ironmaking furnace in just one month. You know, generally speaking, this takes half a year!" In fact, this is unnecessary to be surprised, because such things are too numerous to mention in Anshan. For example, Li Enqin, a graduate of Tianjin University, has been apprenticing at the construction site of the large rolling mill for less than six months, and is not only able to take on his inspection work very well, but also able to act as the head of an inspection section. And Comrade Huang Zhanshi, who graduated from Northeast Institute of Technology in August last year, has now become the designer of the bricklaying project of No. 7 blast furnace.... Here I don't want to write about more people, because as many people answered me: "This is endless!" Now I want to talk about their lives.

        When it comes to life, people easily think of eating, living, wearing, playing.... If life only refers to these, in order to be true to the facts, I must say that in these aspects, they are quite difficult. Because the urban construction of Anshan is not keeping up with the industrial construction, so they have to queue up for haircuts, movies, shopping, bathing, and even eating. And what about housing? They often squeeze several people into a small room. However, they believe that there are more important things in life than this: labor and work to create a happy life. Therefore, they do not feel that this hardship damages their lives. On the contrary, this hardship has enriched the meaning of their lives even more. As many of them said, "A good life belongs to those who create life in hard work, not to those who specialize in enjoying happiness." So they think their lives are beautiful and meaningful. Perhaps some people don't believe me when I say this, now let everyone look at a page of Zong Fuyu's diary on October 26 last year. The opening sentence of this diary is: "Life is for happiness, just like birds are for flying." Then, as if speaking to his lover far away in Beijing, he wrote: "Today is Sunday, I really want to play with you. - Who doesn't want to walk around and play with their lover on holidays, or see beautiful scenery? But it is precisely for this, and something better than this, that I left you and came to the steel capital of Anshan to participate in construction. Now, in our construction site, in order to build faster, Sundays are also very busy. Of course, there are no flowers and trees here now, only coal smoke and roaring machines. But I tell you, precisely because of this, I feel that our lives are more abundant and meaningful." Then, in another day's diary, he wrote: "To be honest, I think my life now is the best!" I don't want to write more about their lives, because from this simple diary, we can already see how pleasant and satisfied these young people feel about their lives.

    Writing here, I remembered again a fast-paced poem written by workers about them: "These students are really good, each one is a treasure for work, making fast progress and having good thoughts, in a few years they will be amazing!" Yes, these young people who grew up in the Mao Zedong era are indeed priceless treasures for the construction of the motherland. In a few years, these priceless treasures will release magnificent brilliance in the construction cause of the motherland, and the seedlings of this brilliance have already been clearly revealed now.

    光彩的青春
    ——记去年来鞍山参加建设的一批大学生
    爱芝
    去年八九月间，到钢都鞍山参加建设的一千三百余名大学生中，每天总有好多人收到对他们关怀与问询的来信——问询他们是不是把自己青春的光和热，献给钢都的建设；关怀他们的一举一动是不是合乎新中国技术人员的身份。我不知道这些寄信者是不是获得了圆满的回答，但是，我想，作为一个记者的我，有义务把这些告诉那些寄信者，及一切关怀他们的人们。为了履行这个义务，我几乎访问了他们工作的每个工地和机关。在访问中，我访问过领导干部和工人，也访问过他们中间的许多人。这些访问给我的共同回答是：他们在钢都的建设中，献出了自己青春的光和热，他们用自己酷爱祖国建设事业的行动，证明了自己合乎新中国技术人员的身份。在没述说他们是在怎样工作着之前，我想先让大家听听工人对他们的评论。
    勇敢朴实而又多才多艺的工人们，是不喜欢把赞词轻易送给任何人的，但是，他们对这些新中国的大学生们却十分慷慨。在我访问的十多个部门中，几乎每一个部门的工人都这样对我说：“这些大学生好啊！几乎他们个个都积极努力！”他们不但对我这样说，而且时常把类似的赞词写在自己的黑板报上，或在广播台上高声宣讲。甚至还有的工人把自己的赞词送进这些大学生的口袋里，譬如来自四川川北大学的林俊良，他的口袋里就装着这样一封工人来信：“你的工作积极努力，能和我们打成一片，还能教我们技术。我们要暂时离开工地去学习去了，所以我们特别向你表示感谢！”
    他们，这些新中国的大学生们，究竟用什么取得了工人们这种朴实而高贵的称颂和爱护呢？一句话，他们用热爱人民建设事业的品德，及由此产生的那种忘我工作的精神。现在就让我从病在医院的王泽霖同学说起，说说他们究竟是怎样对待和从事人民交给他们的工作的吧！
    王泽霖同学是去年八月间在沈阳工学院冶金系毕业的学生。他到鞍山后的具体工作是在炼钢厂见习炼钢，以便将来参加新炼钢厂的建设工作。这个青年一到炼钢厂，就立即迷上了这一工作。他为多争取一点工作和学习的时间，从上班那天起，他总是第一天晚上买下馒头，第二天四点起床，一面向工厂走，一面在路上吃。后来别人劝他要注意健康，不要弄垮了身体，他却始终认为：“热爱工作的人，是累不倒的！”但去年年底，他终于因为过于劳累病倒在医院里了。可是就是病倒在医院里，也不能使他忘记了工作。一月六日，他因为忍不住暂时离开工作的痛苦，而写信给他的伙伴们道：
        “我常想最好不要有黑夜，因为它会夺去我们的工作时间。在现场见习的时候，为了多争取一点工作和学习时间，每天我总是清晨四点钟起床，然后拿了冷馒头，一边吃，一边向工厂去。我想，我应当把我的一切都献给钢都的建设。但是，我现在病了，这是多么不幸啊！
    “不过，病不能使我忘记了工作和学习。我躺在床上，常常一面吃着药，一面想着工作。一想到工作，我就想到黑压压的人群，在汽笛一响的时候，一齐涌进工地或工厂去。
    “我羡慕你们能够工作。我一刻也不愿意离开祖国交给我的工作。可是病强迫我暂时离开了它，同志们，你们想想，这是多么不幸啊！”
    朋友们，这是一封信吗？不是的，这是一团青春的烈火。通过它，我们不仅可以看到王泽霖的光彩的青春，和他身上时刻闪烁着的酷爱国家建设事业的高贵品德，同时我们也可以看到他们——这些新中国大学生们的光彩的青春。王泽霖正是这些青年们的代表之一。
    在鞍山的工地上，我访问过他们许多人。在访问中，我发现几乎他们每一个人都为自己规定了一条特殊的工作纪律：“只准把工作做好，不准把工作做坏！”因此，偶而因工作不够熟练，出了一点差错，便成了他们最难过的事情。当然这种难过不是出于小资产阶级的病态自尊，而是出于对人民事业的高度责任心。见习技术员宗福腴便是一个例子。
    宗福腴是来自北京铁道学院的学生，今年二十三岁，是个十分果敢而刚强的青年。据他自己说，从十二、三岁之后，从来没有流过眼泪。但他到鞍山大型轧钢厂工地后，却因为一件工作没有做好而流泪了。事情是这样的：去年十月六日的清晨，宗福腴一上班就听说挖土机在挖土中遇到了巨大的混凝土块，因而不能再挖了。当时他非常着急，因为他知道一台挖土机停上几个小时，就等于上百人少做一天工作。于是他便急急地要了一百多个临时工，去突击挖掘混凝土块。谁知他把工人带到现场以后，却还没用上一半。就在这时候，有的工人向他提出了批评：“浪费！”跟着这个批评，宗福腴破例地流下了眼泪。向来刚强的宗福腴，为什么在这个时候流泪了呢？是不是因为他在批评面前失掉了自己固有的刚强性格呢？不是的，请看看他当天的日记吧：“对于人民财富的浪费，我认为是一种犯罪。今天，因我考虑不周所造成的浪费，使我感到非常痛苦。这种痛苦，使我破例地流下了眼泪！”从到工地那天起，宗福腴就是以这样的态度对待着自己的每一工作，并从而被他所在工段的同志们选为先进工作者之一。
    类似王泽林、宗福腴一样的人物，我可以毫不夸大地说，在他们中间是占着绝大多数的。有一次，我问设计处炼铁科的副科长李锡培同志：“在你们科工作的大学生们工作怎样呀？”他毫不迟疑地回答我说：“好啊！他们虽然刚来不到半年，但是现在他们已经成了我们科的骨干分子。”接着他便告诉了我黄占石、李景熙等五个人工作的情形说：“他们几乎全是工作很好的。”最后我又问他：
    “你们科一共有几个去年八九月间来的大学生？”他说：“不多，就是六个！”类似的访问，我进行过许多次，但我得到的回答却是一样的。从这些访问中，我看到了热爱人民事业的高贵品德，已在这些青年中普遍地生长起来。
        这种新的品德，使他们获得人们的称颂，也获得了技术上的飞速进步，和真正的生活。一个年老的工程师曾用惊奇的口吻告诉我：“在炼铁厂见习的大学生李景熙真了不得！他仅用一个月的时间，就基本上学会了掌握一座炼铁炉的操作。你要知道，一般说来，这是需要半年的！”其实这是用不到惊奇的，因为这样的事情，在鞍山是举不胜举的。比如津沽大学毕业的李恩勤，到大型轧钢厂工地见习还不到六个月，便不仅能够很好地负担起自己的检查工作，且已能够代理一个检查科长的工作。而去年八月间刚从东北工学院毕业的黄占石同学，现在已经成了七号高炉砌砖工程的设计者……。在这里我不想再写更多的人了，因为正如许多人回答我的一样：“这是说不完的！”现在我想说说他们的生活。
        一提到生活，人们容易想到吃、住、穿，玩……。如果生活仅是指的这些的话，为了忠于事实，我必须说，就这些方面来说，他们是相当艰苦的。因为目前鞍山的城市建设，还赶不上工业建设，因此他们理发、看电影、买东西、洗澡甚至吃饭等，都要排队。而住房子呢？也往往几个人挤在一间小房里。然而他们却认为生活还有比这更重要的东西：缔造幸福生活的劳动和工作。因此，他们并不觉得这种艰苦损害了他们的生活，相反的，这种艰苦，更加丰富了他们生活的意义。正如他们许多人所说，“美好的生活，是属于在艰苦劳动中缔造生活的人们，而不属于专门享福者。”所以他们认为他们的生活是美好而有意义的。我这样说，也许有人不信，现在就让大家看一页宗福腴去年十月二十六日的一页日记吧。这篇日记的开头一句是：“人生为了幸福，正如鸟儿为了飞翔一样。”接着，他像面对他的远在北京的爱人说话一样地写道：“今天是星期，我很想和你玩玩。——谁不想和自己的爱人在假日走走玩玩，或看看美丽的风景呢？但是正是为了这，及比这更好的东西，我离开你，而到钢都鞍山来参加建设。现在，在我们的工地里，为了更快的建设，星期日也是很忙的，当然在这里现在也没有花和树，有的只是煤烟和轰鸣着的机器。但是，我告诉你，正是这样，所以我觉得我们的生活才更加丰富和有意义。”继之他在另一天的日记中写道：“老实说，我觉得我现在的生活是最好的！”对于他们的生活，我不想写得更多，因为从这篇简单的日记中，我们已经可以看到，这些青年对自己的生活是感到一种怎样的愉快和满足。
    写到这里，我又想起了工人的一段写他们的快板诗：“这些学生真是好，个个都是工作宝，进步快，思想好，再过几年不得了！”是的，这些在毛泽东时代成长起来的青年们，确是祖国建设的无价之宝。再过几年，这些无价之宝，将会在祖国的建设事业中，放出绮丽的光彩，而这种光彩的苗头，现在已经鲜明地显露出来了。
