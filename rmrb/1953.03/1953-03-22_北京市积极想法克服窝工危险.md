    Beijing Actively Seeks Ways to Overcome the Danger of Work Stoppages
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau is actively seeking ways to overcome the current danger of work stoppages.
    The Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau's seven construction companies have a total of 70,000 workers, including 16,000 permanent workers, 32,000 contract workers, and 22,000 temporary workers. This year, Beijing's construction tasks total 2 million square meters of area, of which approximately 400,000 square meters are carry-over projects. According to the overall task and labor situation, at least 800,000 square meters of construction area should be under construction simultaneously this spring. However, according to an inspection on March 15, only 150,000 square meters of projects can start on schedule; the vast majority of projects cannot start. The reasons why the vast majority of projects cannot start on time are: First, the determination of the overall construction plan and the assignment of tasks were too late. At the same time, during the design process, the commissioning departments often changed plans regarding construction address, form, cost, etc., thus delaying the design time and affecting the new projects from starting as scheduled (currently, only more than 30,000 square meters of new projects can start); second, those carry-over projects that could have started on March 15 also could not start on schedule because the construction departments did not make sufficient use of the winter shutdown to do the necessary construction preparation work. For example, according to regulations, construction cannot be started without a budget, contract, and construction plan, to avoid rework and waste. However, until now, the construction departments do not have unified labor and material quotas and material unit price standards, which means that budgets cannot be made and contracts cannot be signed. It is generally estimated that even if labor and material quotas and material unit price standards can be formulated immediately, it will take at least fifteen to twenty days to make budgets and sign contracts. The Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau has not yet allocated cadres and workers to the construction sites until recently due to certain problems that have not been resolved, which has affected the start of construction.
    In response to this serious situation, the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau has held several engineering meetings recently, analyzed the current work stoppage situation, and proposed the following five measures: First, for projects that currently have problems but can be started immediately through subjective efforts, resolutely ensure that they all start around March 20. To this end, it is planned to adopt the method of making budgets and signing contracts while starting construction, according to the principle of not affecting the start of construction while ensuring planned construction. According to different situations, agreements should be signed first, and contracts should be signed within a time limit; Second, actively negotiate with relevant parties to remove design obstacles and strive to produce construction drawings more quickly, to ensure that new projects can start successively; Third, although there may be work stoppages at present, there will inevitably be rush work and grab work in the second half of the year. Therefore, it is planned to seize the current opportunity of surplus labor to prepare to build approximately 100,000 square meters of work sheds in several major construction sites and work areas, so that workers can be accommodated when new projects start. This will not only solve the problem of work stoppages for approximately 10,000 workers, but also avoid rushing to grab work together in the future; Fourth, on construction sites where conditions permit, adopt parallel operation methods as much as possible, and schedule labor between various construction units and construction sites in a planned manner, to strive to avoid work stoppages and shorten the construction period of existing projects; Fifth, absorb contract workers and temporary workers in a planned manner according to the progress and needs of the project, prevent blindness, and avoid wasting labor as much as possible.
    The various construction companies under the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau are actively implementing the above-mentioned measures, striving to start construction on projects with an area of 400,000 square meters in March, ensuring that approximately 30,000 construction workers have work to do. The various construction companies currently have 16,000 permanent workers, and it is estimated that only a few thousand contract workers can be absorbed recently, so the current work stoppage situation can be overcome. However, if the existing problems cannot be resolved immediately, the work stoppages that have already formed cannot be overcome. If new project drawings with an area of hundreds of thousands of square meters cannot be designed successively in the shortest possible time, and all preparations for construction are not made, then new and more serious dangers of work stoppages may occur in the next two or three months due to the successive completion of carry-over projects and the successive arrival of workers.

    北京市积极想法克服窝工危险
    【本报讯】北京市建筑工程局正积极设法克服当前的窝工危险。
    北京市建筑工程局所属七个建筑工程公司，共有工人七万名，其中固定工一万六千人，预约工三万二千人，临时工二万二千人。今年北京市的建筑任务共有二百万平方公尺的面积，其中跨年度工程约四十万平方公尺。按照整个任务和劳动力情况，今年春季至少应该有八十万平方公尺的建筑面积同时动工。但是，根据三月十五日检查，能够按期开工的工程只有十五万平方公尺；绝大部分工程都不能开工。绝大部分工程不能按时开工的原因是：一、整个建设计划的确定和任务下达太迟，同时在设计过程中，委托部门又常在建筑地址、形式、造价等方面变更计划，因而耽误了设计时间，影响了新的工程不能如期开工（目前能开工的新工程仅有三万多平方公尺）；二、那些本来可以在三月十五日开工的跨年度工程，也由于建筑部门没有充分利用冬季停工的空隙，做好必要的施工准备工作，因而也不能按期开工。例如按照规定，没有预算、合同和施工计划的就不能施工，以免返工浪费。但是一直到现在，建筑部门还没有统一的工料定额和材料单价标准，这就不能造预算和订合同了。据一般估计，即使立即能制订出工料定额和材料单价标准，至少也要经过十五天到二十天时间，才能造好预算和订好合同。北京市建筑工程局因为某些问题迟迟没有解决，到最近还没有把干部和工人分配到工地上去，影响了开工。
    北京市建筑工程局针对这个严重情况，在最近召开了好几次工程会议，分析了当前的窝工情况，提出了下面五项措施：一、凡目前虽然有问题，但经过主观势力立即可开工的工程，坚决做到在三月二十日左右全部开工。为此，准备根据既不影响开工，又要做到有计划施工的原则，采取边造预算、订合同边开工的办法，按照不同情况，首先订好协议书，并限期订好合同；二、积极和有关方面协商，扫除设计障碍，争取更迅速地做出施工图，以保证新的工程能陆续开工；三、目前虽然可能窝工，但在下半年又必然要赶工、抢工。因此，计划抓紧当前劳动力剩余的机会，准备在几个主要的工地和工区，建筑约十万平方公尺的工棚，以便在新工程开工时供工人住宿。这样既可解决约一万名工人的窝工问题，又免得将来挤在一起抢工；四、在有条件的工地，尽可能采用平行作业法，并有计划地在各建筑单位和工地间调度劳动力，以争取不窝工和缩短现有工程工期；五、按照工程进度和需要，有计划地吸收预约工和临时工，防止盲目性，尽可能不浪费劳动力。
    北京市建筑工程局所属各建筑工程公司，正在积极实行上面提出的几项办法，争取在三月份有四十万平方公尺面积的工程开工，保证约三万名建筑工人都有工做。各建筑工程公司现共有固定工一万六千人，估计预约工最近只能吸收到一万数千人，因而可以克服当前的窝工情况。但是，如果存在的问题不能立即解决，则目前已经形成的窝工便不能克服。如果在最短期间还不能陆续设计出数十万平方公尺面积的新工程图纸，并做好施工的一切准备工作，则将因跨年度工程先后完成和工人陆续报到，在今后两三个月中还可能发生新的更严重的窝工危险。
