Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 18th: The "Soviet Art Newspaper," the organ of the Soviet Ministry of Culture, devoted considerable space to articles commemorating the recently deceased prominent Soviet composer, Stalin Prize laureate, and People's Artist of the Russian Federation, Sergei Prokofiev.

The obituary, signed by prominent Soviet composers and musicians, stated: The death of Sergei Prokofiev is a great loss to Soviet culture. A talented and outstanding artist has left this world.

Sergei Prokofiev was born on April 23, 1891, in the village of Sontsovka, former Ekaterinoslav Governorate, into the family of an agricultural operator. His talent was evident in his childhood. In 1909, he graduated from Liadov's composition class at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, and in 1914, he graduated from Eppova's piano class. After 1911, Prokofiev became active as a composer, brilliant pianist, and conductor.

His creative path was tortuous and contradictory. The significant tasks of realistic art bequeathed to him by the teachers of this talented young composer suffered from the damage of modernism for a long period. These artistic contradictions were particularly pronounced during Prokofiev's years of residence abroad. The composer's return to his homeland in 1932 marked the revival of his great talent.

The positive influence of Soviet life and the wise leadership of the Communist Party helped Prokofiev gradually overcome his errors and misconceptions, and helped him find truly realistic methods in music for expressing very important themes and melodies.

The obituary said that Prokofiev's life was an example of selfless devotion to art.

In one of the finest works of Soviet music, Prokofiev's cantata "Alexander Nevsky," the patriotism, military heroism, and fearless spirit of the Russian people in the struggle to defend their homeland, which are the noble spirits of the Russian people, are powerfully depicted. The cantata "Hail to the Long Life" expresses the Soviet people's love for the great Stalin and brings true artistic pleasure to the listener. In the wonderful ballet "Romeo and Juliet," Prokofiev displayed his keen insight as a realistic artist. This ballet has added brilliance to many theaters in the Soviet Union and abroad. The oratorio entitled "On Guard for Peace," in a brilliantly novel way, expresses the theme of the people's struggle for peace and for the happy future of the younger generation. The love of life and joy of life inherent in the Soviet people, as well as true humanism, run through Prokofiev's last movement—the poetic Seventh Symphony.

The obituary said: Prokofiev left us at the height of his creative powers, and he maintained the purity of his thoughts and inspiration until the very last minute.

After many years, the Soviet people will honor the name of this outstanding composer. He wrote a glorious page in the history of Soviet music and brought its glory far beyond the borders of the motherland.

    苏联著名作曲家
    普罗科菲耶夫逝世
    新华社讯：塔斯社莫斯科十八日电，苏联文化部机关报“苏维埃艺术报”，以大量篇幅发表了纪念最近逝世的苏联著名作曲家、斯大林奖金得奖人、俄罗斯联邦人民艺术家谢尔盖·普罗科菲耶夫的文章。
    由苏联著名作曲家和音乐家签名的讣告中指出：谢尔盖·普罗科菲耶夫的逝世是苏维埃文化的一个巨大损失。一位天才卓越的艺术家离开人间了。
    谢尔盖·普罗科菲耶夫在一八九一年四月二十三日生于前伊卡特林诺斯拉夫州桑特索夫卡村一个农业经营者的家庭。他的天才在童年时代就显示了出来。一九○九年，他在彼得堡音乐院利亚多夫的作曲班毕业，一九一四年在艾波娃的钢琴班毕业。一九一一年以后，普罗科菲耶夫作为一位作曲家、辉煌的钢琴家和乐队指挥而活跃起来。
    他的创作道路是曲折而矛盾的。这位天才的青年作曲家的教师们所遗留给他的现实主义艺术的重大任务，有很久一个时期遭受现代主义的损害。在普罗科菲耶夫侨居国外的年代，他的艺术上的这些矛盾表现得特别显著。这位作曲家在一九三二年回到祖国的时候，是他的伟大天才开始复活的日子。
    苏维埃生活的良好影响和共产党的英明领导，帮助普罗科菲耶夫逐渐克服了他的错误和谬见，帮助他在音乐上寻觅关于表现非常重要的主题和旋律的真正现实主义的方法。
    讣告上说，普罗科菲耶夫的一生是忘我地献身于艺术的一个榜样。
    在苏联音乐的最优秀的作品之一、普罗科菲耶夫的康塔塔“亚历山大·涅夫斯基”中，有力地描绘出作为俄罗斯人民的崇高精神的爱国主义，他们在军事上的英勇，以及在保卫祖国的斗争中大无畏的精神。康塔塔“祝万寿无疆”一曲表达苏联人民对伟大斯大林的热爱，带给听者以真正的艺术的快乐。在美妙的舞剧“罗密欧与朱丽叶”中，普罗科菲耶夫显示了他作为现实主义艺术家的敏锐的洞察力。这一个舞剧在苏联和外国为许多剧院增加了光彩。命名为“保卫和平”的喧叙曲，用一种天才的新颖的方式，表现人民为和平、为年青一代幸福的将来而斗争的主题。为苏联人民所固有的对生活的热爱和生命的快乐以及真正的人道主义，贯穿在普罗科菲耶夫作的最后一部乐章——充满诗意的第七交响乐中。
    讣告上说：普罗科菲耶夫在他创作力高度发展时离开我们了，他把他的思想和灵感的纯洁性保持到最后一分钟。
    多少年后，苏联人民都将尊崇这位卓越的作曲家的名字。他在苏联音乐史上写下了光辉的一页，并把它的光荣带到祖国边疆以外遥远的地方。
