Editor's Note: Since the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on strictly preventing forest fires in March 1952, some local leading cadres still do not pay enough attention, have not carried out widespread and in-depth publicity and education, nor implemented specific work on the instructions, so that forest fires and indiscriminate logging incidents continue to occur. The following letters from Li Xingbei and others are examples. At present, the country's large-scale economic construction is beginning, and the demand for timber will increase significantly, making the protection of the country's existing forest resources even more important. The Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government issued further instructions on forest protection and fire prevention on the 2nd of this month. We hope that local people's governments will correct acts that violate forest protection policies and implement the instructions on forest protection and fire prevention.

　　Daxing County People's Government Indulges the Masses in Harvesting Seedlings
　　Fu Kexiang writes: The masses in the Second District of Daxing County and Liangxiang have harvested six to seven hundred small trees of ten to fifteen centimeters in diameter from the end of last year to the present, and hauled them to Mentougou for sale. But strangely, the county people's government turns a blind eye to the masses' lack of care for trees. Our country's forest resources are not excessive, but insufficient; these small trees are still growing, and it is a pity to cut them down. It is hoped that the county people's government will quickly educate the masses to stop this behavior.
　　Huoshan County Burned Over Six Hundred Mu; The Masses Should Be Educated to Prevent Forest Fires
　　Li Zuolai and Guo Wei write: Serious forest fire incidents occurred in Songjiahe and Liujiayuan Townships in Dahua Ping District, Huoshan County, Anhui Province in January this year. The disaster area reached 670 mu, and 6,874 trees were lost. The fire was caused by Cheng Xinshou, a farmer from Songjiahe Township, who lit firecrackers at a shrine on the mountain. The Songjiahe Township government reported the fire incident to the district government on January 12, and the district government delayed it for half a month before reporting it to the Huoshan County People's Court; and the court has not yet taken appropriate action. Now that the Qingming Festival is approaching, many people still have the habit of burning paper offerings at graves. In order to prevent fires from occurring again, it is suggested that the Huoshan County People's Government seriously handle the Songjiahe fire case and widely conduct fire prevention and forest protection education among the masses.
　　Eight Forest Fire Incidents Occurred Continuously in Yuanqu County, Shanxi Province in Twenty Days
　　Li Xingbei writes: Forest fire accidents have been occurring continuously in Xia County, Fangshan, Wutai, Daixian, Dingxiang, Yuanqu and other counties in Shanxi Province recently. In particular, in Yuanqu County, from December 21 last year to January 9 this year, eight forest fire incidents occurred continuously in twenty days, burning down a forest area of more than 1,600 mu and more than 20,000 trees of all sizes, causing serious losses to the country's forests. The reason for the forest fires is that the county's leading cadres do not have enough understanding of the central government's forest protection policies and are very paralyzed in their thinking.
　　Another noteworthy situation is that some people in Xiaoyao Village, Sixth District of Qinyang, Henan Province, frequently went to the Xianshenhe forest area of Jincheng County, Shanxi Province to cut down trees in July 1952. The destroyed forest area stretched for more than 20 li and was 3 li wide. In late November last year, they went to Sijiagou Village, Jincheng County, and cut down more than 900 private trees belonging to military dependent Chen Qunlu. After the people of Jincheng County raised their concerns to the Qinyang County People's Government, the Qinyang County People's Government still did not stop them. I believe that this behavior of indulging the masses in wantonly destroying the country's forest resources is very wrong. It is hoped that the Henan Provincial People's Government will deal with it promptly.
　　Mianzhu Girls' High School Violated Government Regulations and Indiscriminately Logged Trees in the School Construction Project
　　Bai Ruyi writes: In the construction project of the Mianzhu Girls' High School in Sichuan, with the approval of the Construction Section of the Mianzhu County People's Government, fifteen trees of Huanglian, Sour Jujube, and Cypress were harvested in the fourth and fifth villages of Zundao in November last year. However, Zhao Zhuyuan, the school's logging staff, did not comply with government regulations, and the diameter at breast height of the sour jujube trees felled exceeded what the government had approved; and he also felled valuable Nanmu trees that are under national unified management. When they cut down large trees, they also crushed and broke 41 miscellaneous trees. After the local township cadres stopped them and reported to the county people's government, the school principal Fu Pingxiang wrote a letter of self-criticism; however, Li Haixin, the school's dean of teaching affairs, felled valuable Nanmu and Xiangzhang trees in Thirteenth Village, Tumen, in early December. It is recommended that the Mianyang Prefecture strictly deal with the school's erroneous behavior of not paying attention to government decrees.
　　Local Government in the Weining Mountain Area of Guizhou Should Educate the Masses Not to Cut Down Trees Randomly
　　Liu Yuhua writes: Most of the Weining area of Guizhou is mountainous forest land, and the phenomenon of the masses cutting down trees indiscriminately is very serious. They cut down large pine trees with a diameter of ten to twenty inches to use as "Mingzi" for lighting at night. Some trees are cut halfway and then abandoned; some trees are cut down and fall to the side. Such wood can be seen everywhere on the road from the ninth district to the third district of the county. The firewood for the county's masses to make fires and burn boilers is also split from large trees. It is recommended that local governments and staff members educate the masses to save these valuable timbers for the needs of national construction.

### 反对破坏森林资源的行为

专栏：读者来信摘要

    反对破坏森林资源的行为
    编者按：一九五二年三月中共中央和中央人民政府政务院发出关于严防森林火灾的指示以后，至今还有些地区领导干部重视不够，没有作普遍深入的宣传教育和贯彻指示的具体工作，以致森林火灾和胡乱砍伐林木事件还不断发生。下面发表的李兴北等的来信便是例子。目前国家大规模经济建设正在开始，木材需要量将显著增加，保护国家现有森林资源的意义更加重大。中央人民政府林业部于本月二日又发出了关于护林防火的指示。我们希望各地人民政府对于违反护林政策的行为予以纠正，把护林防火的指示贯彻下去。
      大兴县人民政府放纵群众采伐树苗
    傅科祥来信：大兴县二区和良乡的群众，从去年年底到现在采伐了六七百棵十几公分的小树，拉到门头沟来卖。但奇怪的是，该县人民政府对群众这种不爱护林木的行为却置之不理。我们祖国的森林资源不是过多，而是不足；这些小树又是正在生长的时候，砍伐了实在可惜。希望该县人民政府赶紧教育群众停止这种行为。
    霍山县烧山六百多亩应教育群众防火护林
    李作来、郭威来信：安徽霍山县大化坪区宋家河、留驾园两乡，在今年一月间发生严重的烧山事件。受灾面积达六百七十亩，损失树木六千八百七十四株。起火原因是宋家河乡农民程新寿在山上神庙烧香放爆竹而引起的。宋家河乡政府在一月十二日把这一失火事件报告区政府，区政府拖延了半个月才上报到霍山县人民法院；而该院到现在未作适当处理。现在清明节就要到了，许多群众还有上坟烧纸的习惯，为了防止再次引起火灾，建议霍山县人民政府严肃处理宋家河烧山案件，并在群众中广泛进行防火护林教育。
    山西垣曲县在二十天中连续发生烧山事件八起
    李兴北来信：山西省夏县、方山、五台、代县、定襄、垣曲等县，近来不断发生森林火灾事故。特别是垣曲县从去年十二月二十一日到今年一月九日，二十天中连续发生烧山事件八起，烧毁森林面积达一千六百余亩，大小树达两万余株，使祖国森林受到严重损失。造成森林火灾的原因，是该县领导干部对中央护林政策认识不够，思想十分麻痹。
    另一个值得注意的情况是：河南沁阳六区小窑村部分群众，在一九五二年七月间经常到山西省晋城县仙神河林区砍伐林木。被破坏的森林面积长达二十余里，宽三里。去年十一月下旬，他们又到晋城县司家沟村砍伐军属陈群炉的私林九百余株。晋城县人民向沁阳县人民政府提出意见后，沁阳县人民政府仍然未加制止。我认为这种放纵群众对国家森林资源滥加破坏的行为是十分错误的。希望河南省人民政府迅速处理。
    绵竹女中在建校工程中违反政府规定滥伐林木
    白如义来信：四川绵竹女子中学在建校工程中，原经绵竹县人民政府建设科批准，在去年十一月间到遵道四、五等村采伐黄连、酸枣、柏树等十五株。但该校采伐人员赵铸元不遵照政府规定，所砍伐的酸枣树胸径均超过政府所批准的；并且还砍伐了国家统一管理的珍贵的楠木。他们在砍伐大树时，还压伤、压断杂树四十一株。经当地区乡干部阻止并报告县人民政府后，该校校长傅平骧虽然写了检讨书；但该校教导主任李海鑫又于十二月初旬在土门十三村砍伐珍贵的楠木和楿樟。建议绵阳专署严正处理该校这样不重视政府法令的错误行为。
    贵州威宁山区当地政府应教育群众不要乱砍林木
    刘毓华来信：贵州威宁地区大部是山林地带，群众乱砍乱伐林木的现象十分严重。他们把直径十至二十市寸的大松树，砍了作为夜间照亮用的“明子”。有的树砍了半截就不要了；有的树被砍断了就倒在一边。由该县九区到三区的路上，到处都可见到这样的木料。该县群众烤火、烧锅的木柴，也是由大树劈成的。建议当地政府和工作人员，向群众进行教育，要他们节省这些贵重的木材，供国家建设的需要。
