Reader Mail Summary

    Reader Mail Handling in February
    In February, the reader mail group of this newspaper received a total of 9,338 letters from readers and responses from various agencies. Among them, 3,826 were related to political and legal issues, 2,760 were related to industrial and agricultural production and financial and economic issues, 2,360 were related to cultural and educational issues, and 392 were of other nature. The handling of these letters is as follows: 529 were published in this newspaper, 2,289 were answered individually, 4,549 were forwarded to relevant agencies for investigation, processing, response or reference, and 3,267 were retained by this newspaper for reference and did not require further processing; some of the letters processed were left over from the previous month. In addition, there were 1,248 letters from family members of revolutionary soldiers seeking revolutionary soldiers, the numbers are not included in the statistics.
    In February, letters concerning opposition to bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline still accounted for a large proportion. For this type of letter, we will continue to handle it according to the principles proposed in the "January Reader Mail Handling Situation." It should be particularly pointed out that: we publicly publish in the newspaper more significant events that combine the current central work to expose bureaucracy (such as letters criticizing industrial and mining enterprises and water conservancy construction sites for not caring about national plans and national wealth, and not caring about production safety and the suffering of workers) and letters exposing incidents of suppression of criticism.
    In February, there were a total of 624 letters concerning marriage issues. Among them, we selected and published some letters reflecting the implementation of the Marriage Law in various places and the new atmosphere after the implementation of the Marriage Law, and the rest were retained for reference; letters criticizing cadres for making mistakes in implementing the Marriage Law or violating the Marriage Law themselves, in addition to publicly publishing typical events with serious problems, are generally transferred to relevant agencies for processing; there are also many letters raising common sense questions or specific questions requesting this newspaper to answer or solve them, because these questions can be resolved in the movement to implement the Marriage Law, we will no longer answer them one by one.
    Many readers continue to write to inquire about issues related to the convening of the National People's Congress, we will soon make a comprehensive public response. A large number of letters expose the chaotic phenomena in the current periodical distribution work, we are studying it and will publish a comprehensive report, and will no longer make individual responses. Many readers have written to reflect some problems in the current education work, such as the decline in the health of college students, the chaotic phenomena in some secondary technical schools, the busy and chaotic phenomena in primary school education in some areas, and the problems in rectifying primary school education work, we are focusing on research, and some will be published publicly. Some letters reflecting the current central work in various places and the ideological situation of cadres and the masses, we have retained for reference and will no longer make individual responses.
    We have transferred letters from readers reporting mines, as well as readers' opinions on the treatment of staff members of government agencies, the class status of individuals in rural areas, the improper use of certain trademark patterns and words, the crowdedness of public transportation in Beijing and other cities, the inability to get through on the phone, the difficulty in buying train tickets before and after the Spring Festival, the poor order of trains, and the bad attitude of service personnel at railway bureaus, and the fee collection methods for small postal remittances to relevant agencies for research and processing, and will no longer respond to readers individually.
    In addition, many readers have written to inquire about how to treat their illnesses, the application procedures for various schools, and to request this newspaper to introduce them to jobs. We believe that: treatment of illnesses must be determined by a doctor's diagnosis; application procedures for schools should be publicly explained when each school enrolls students, and if there are still unclear points, you can directly inquire with the relevant enrollment agencies; the employment problem of urban unemployed people should be registered with the local labor employment committee for resolution. For the above types of letters, except in special circumstances, we will no longer respond to them individually in the future.
    Finally, one more statement: The main situation of reader mail in the fourth week of February should have been announced in the first week of March; however, due to the major event of Comrade Stalin's unfortunate death, the newspaper was very crowded, and it could not be published as scheduled. The handling of letters in February has now been announced, so it will not be reissued.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    二月份读者来信处理情况
    二月份，本报读者来信组收到读者来信和各机关答复读者的信共九千三百三十八件。其中有关政法问题的三千八百二十六件，有关工农业生产和财经问题的二千七百六十件，有关文教问题的二千三百六十件，其它性质的来信三百九十二件。这些来信的处理情况是：已在本报刊登的五百二十九件，个别答复读者的二千二百八十九件，转请各有关机关调查、处理、答复或参考的四千五百四十九件，留存本报参考以及不需再作处理的三千二百六十七件；在已处理的来信中，有一部分是上月留下的。此外，还有革命军人家属寻找革命军人的来信一千二百四十八件，数字未统计在内。
    有关反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的来信在二月份仍占很大比重。对于这类来信，我们仍按“一月份读者来信处理情况”中所提出的原则处理。特别应当提出的是：其中结合当前中心工作揭发官僚主义（如批评工矿企业和水利工地不关心国家计划和国家财富，不关心生产安全和工人疾苦的来信等）以及揭发压制批评事件的来信，我们都选择比较重大的事件在报纸上公开发表。
    二月份有关婚姻问题的来信共有六百二十四件。其中反映各地贯彻婚姻法的情况以及贯彻婚姻法后的新气象的，我们选择一部分发表，其余留存参考；批评干部执行婚姻法有错误或自己违犯婚姻法的，我们除选择问题严重的典型事件公开发表外，
    一般均转请各有关机关处理；还有很多来信提出一些常识问题或具体问题要求本报解答或解决，因为这些问题在贯彻婚姻法运动中可以得到解决，我们不再逐一答复。
    有不少读者继续来信询问有关召开全国人民代表大会的一些问题，我们即将公开作综合答复。有大量来信揭露目前期刊发行工作中的混乱现象，我们正在研究，并将综合发表，不再作个别答复。有不少读者来信反映目前教育工作中的一些问题，如高等学校学生健康情况下降、某些中等技术学校的混乱现象、某些地区小学教育中的忙乱现象和整顿小学教育工作中的问题等，我们正在集中研究，有的将公开发表。有一些反映目前各地中心工作和干部、群众思想情况的来信，我们都留存参考，不再作个别答复。
    有关读者报矿的来信以及读者对机关工作人员待遇，对本人在农村中所划成份，对某些商标图案及文字使用不当，对北京等地市内乘车拥挤、电话叫不通，对春节前后乘火车买不到票、列车秩序不好和路局服务人员态度不好，对邮局小额汇款收费办法等方面提出意见的来信，我们都已转请有关机关研究处理，不再个别答复读者。
    此外，有不少读者来信询问他所患的病如何治疗，各学校招考手续如何以及要求本报介绍职业。我们认为：治病问题必须经医师诊断才能决定治疗方法；投考学校手续问题在各校招生时当有公开说明，如还有不明了处可直接询问有关招生机构；城市失业者就业问题应向当地劳动就业委员会登记解决。以上几类来信，除特殊情况外，今后我们不再个别答复。
    最后还有一点声明：二月份第四周读者来信主要情况本应在三月第一周内公布；但因斯大林同志不幸逝世的重大事件发生，报面十分拥挤，致未能如期发表。现已公布二月份来信处理情况，故不再补发。
