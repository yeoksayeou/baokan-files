    The Feidong County People's Government Pays Attention to Solving the Problem of Farmers Blindly Flowing to Cities
    Letter from the Feidong County People's Government: The People's Daily published on January 30th a letter from reader Wu Wei suggesting that our county's People's Government persuade farmers not to blindly flow into cities. The opinions put forward in it are correct. In some areas of our county with large populations and little land, and surplus labor, the phenomenon of farmers flowing into cities during the slack farming season is indeed common, especially in the democratic townships of Dianbu District, which is close to Hefei City. After the autumn harvest of 1952, we discovered this phenomenon and twice notified the district and township people's governments to persuade and dissuade the masses; however, because we failed to seriously inspect the implementation, the above phenomenon was not well controlled. In addition to notifying all districts and townships again to persuade and dissuade farmers who want to flow into the cities, we are also leading and organizing farmers to develop agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry production, develop sideline and handicraft production under favorable conditions, and gradually solve the problem of surplus rural labor, and prosper the rural economy, in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's instructions. Spring production is imminent, and we will seize this opportunity to carry out our work.

    肥东县人民政府已重视解决农民盲目向城市流动的问题
    肥东县人民政府来信：一月三十日人民日报发表了读者吴伟建议我县人民政府说服农民不要盲目向城市流动的来信，其中提出的意见是正确的。我县部分人多地少、劳力有剩余的地区，农民在农闲时期向城市流动的现象确实不少，尤其是靠近合肥市店埠区民主等乡情况更为严重。一九五二年秋收后我们发现这种现象，曾两次通知区乡人民政府向群众进行说服、劝阻；但由于我们未能认真检查执行情况，上述现象未能很好制止。我们现在除已再次通知各区乡对要求流入城市的农民进行说服和劝阻外，并根据政务院指示的精神，领导、组织农民发展农、林、畜牧业生产，在有利条件下发展副业和手工业生产，逐步解决农村剩余劳力问题，繁荣农村经济。春季生产在即，我们将抓住这一时机来进行工作。
