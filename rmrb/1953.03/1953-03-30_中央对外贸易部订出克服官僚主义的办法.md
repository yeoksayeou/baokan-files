The Central Foreign Trade Department and its affiliated specialized companies, from March 2nd to March 21st, launched a struggle against bureaucracy in conjunction with their current work. A total of 4,729 problems were identified by various units. Judging from the revealed problems, the main shortcomings in the state-owned import and export work are the lack of systematic investigation and research into domestic and foreign production and sales conditions and market prices, reckless purchases without careful calculation, resulting in stockpiling of goods, excessive occupation of funds, and large interest payments, leading to waste. In addition, due to poor storage, some stockpiled goods have deteriorated and rotted. Furthermore, due to unsound ordering systems, unorganized work, unclear division of labor, and ambiguous responsibilities, incorrect allocation and transportation of imported materials have occurred repeatedly, which not only affected the needs of production departments, but also increased commodity circulation costs. For example, several kinds of materials purchased by the China National Import and Export Corporation in May 1951 have not yet been sold, and the losses from storage, interest, and spoilage alone amounted to more than 210 billion yuan. The interest alone on goods stockpiled by the China National Animal By-Products Import & Export Corporation in 1952 amounted to 123 billion yuan.

In the foreign trade administrative departments, the main manifestations of bureaucracy are red tape, delays, carelessness, and irresponsibility. When the Capital Construction Department was reviewing capital construction expenditures, the drafter mistakenly wrote 98 billion yuan as 980 billion yuan. The section chief and department head both approved it, and it was only discovered and corrected when it was reported to the minister. When the China National Machinery Import Corporation was handling settlement of exchange and calculating bank charges, it mistakenly wrote 0.15 percent as 1.5 percent, resulting in an overpayment of more than 10 million yuan. A reader's letter forwarded by this newspaper to the former Central Trade Department on April 22, 1952, requesting a solution to the problem of fresh egg exports, has gone through nine units and more than 400 procedures, and has not yet been answered.

The Ministry of Foreign Trade shoulders the country's major tasks, and the bureaucratic work style of foreign trade departments not only affects the national economy and the people's livelihood, but also international affairs. In order to overcome the above-mentioned bureaucratic phenomena, the Ministry of Foreign Trade has decided to take the following measures:

	(1) Establish a system of unified leadership and division of responsibilities. The principles, policies, and guidelines must be unified under leadership, and daily business work shall implement a specialist responsibility system. Establish departmental work and give full play to the ability of each office, bureau, division, and company to independently handle problems within the established guidelines, policies, and plans. Problems that should be solved within one's own authority should be boldly and responsibly solved, and no procrastination or buck-passing is allowed. The heads of the ministry should strengthen supervision and inspection, so that each unit can truly assume the responsibility of guaranteeing the completion of tasks.

	(2) Establish an inspection system. At the end of this month, Vice Minister Kong Yuan will lead an inspection team to East China to closely contact local workers and masses, and focus on inspecting and assisting the work of local companies, warehouses, processing plants, and customs. In the future, other vice ministers will also take turns to go down to inspect work.

	(3) With the implementation of the economic accounting system as the center, systematically solve the following major problems in a planned and step-by-step manner: the foreign trade guidelines and tasks for 1953, the organizational structure and division of labor of foreign trade units, the export price policy plan for local and special products, import work procedures, and the work regulations for foreign trade commissioners.

The responsible cadres of each unit will each make a summary review report to their respective units, and resolutely implement the five resolutions of the Ministry of Foreign Trade this February on strengthening political and ideological leadership, mastering professional skills, overcoming busy and passive situations, cadre policies, organizational structure and division of labor, and employee welfare. On the basis of the victory in the anti-bureaucracy struggle, fully launch labor competitions and implement the economic accounting system in order to complete the foreign trade tasks for 1953.

    中央对外贸易部订出克服官僚主义的办法
    中央对外贸易部及其所属各专业公司，从三月二日至三月二十一日，结合当前工作，展开了反官僚主义斗争。各单位检查出来的问题总计有四千七百二十九件。从揭发出来的问题来看，国营进出口工作中的主要毛病是对国内外产销情况及市场价格情况缺乏系统的调查研究，不精打细算，盲目收购，造成商品积压，占用资金多，付出利息大等浪费现象；加以保管不善，部分积压商品竟变质霉烂了。另外，由于订货制度不健全，组织工作不严密，分工不明，责任不清，进口物资屡次发生错拨、错运事故，不但影响了生产部门的需要，而且增加了商品流转费用。例如中国进出口公司一九五一年五月收购的几种物资，到现在还未卖出，仅仓租、利息及变质的损失就有二千一百多亿元；中国畜产公司一九五二年积压的商品，仅利息一项即损失一千二百三十亿元。
    在对外贸易行政部门中，官僚主义的主要表现是文牍主义、拖延迟缓、粗枝大叶、不负责任。该部基本建设处在核批基本建设费时，拟稿人误将九十八亿余元写成九千八百亿余元，科长、处长都同意了，报到部长那里，始被发现纠正。中国机械进口公司办理结汇、计算银行手续费时，误将百分之零点一五写为百分之一点五，结果多付了一千多万元。本报一九五二年四月二十二日转给前中央贸易部一封要求解决鲜蛋出口问题的读者来信，这封信经过九个单位、四百多道手续，至今还未答复。
    对外贸易部担负着国家的重大任务，对外贸易部门的官僚主义作风，不仅影响国计民生，甚至影响着国际事务。为了克服上述官僚主义现象，对外贸易部决定采取以下措施：
    （一）建立统一领导、分工负责的制度。方针、政策和原则问题必须统一领导，日常业务工作实行专责制。建立部门工作，发挥各署、局、处及公司在既定的方针、政策和计划范围内独立处理问题的能力。在自己职权范围内应解决的问题，要大胆负责去解决，不允许推诿拖延。部首长应加强督促检查，使各单位能真正负起保证完成任务的责任。
    （二）建立检查制度。本月底由孔原副部长带领检查组到华东，密切联系当地职工群众，有重点地检查与帮助当地的公司、仓库、加工厂及海关的工作。以后其他副部长也将分别轮流下去检查工作。
    （三）有计划有步骤地以推行经济核算制为中心，系统解决以下几个重大问题：一九五三年的对外贸易方针与任务、对外贸易各单位的组织机构与分工、土特产品的出口价格政策方案、进口工作程序、对外贸易特派员工作条例等问题。
    各单位负责干部，将分别向本单位作一次总结性的检讨报告，并坚决贯彻对外贸易部今年二月关于加强政治思想领导，精通业务技术，克服忙乱与被动，干部政策，组织机构与分工，职工福利的五项决议。在反对官僚主义斗争胜利的基础上，全面开展劳动竞赛，贯彻经济核算制，以完成一九五三年的对外贸易任务。
