    Zhang Junxian, Commissioner of the Weinan Prefecture, and Others Suppress Criticism and Frame Cadre Zuo Jiashan
    Wei Zhongtang writes: Zuo Jiashan, a cadre in Weinan Prefecture, Shaanxi, was severely retaliated against and persecuted for exposing the leading cadres' violations of financial and economic discipline and other wrongdoings during the Three-Anti Campaign.
    In 1949, the Weinan Prefecture used more than 300 million yuan of public funds to do business, and the profits were not accounted for. In 1950, when cleaning up the warehouse, the prefecture bought a large quantity of cloth and stored it at a private merchant's place (as a result, part of the cloth was moldy and rotten; part was sold by the private merchant, and the money could not be recovered). During the Three-Anti Campaign, Zuo Jiashan, a cadre of the prefecture, criticized the above-mentioned problems at a general meeting of all personnel in the prefecture. Wu Rongqiu, the administrative secretary of the prefecture (who was directly involved in the business and was a relative of the private merchant who stored the cloth), became furious on the spot and scolded Zuo Jiashan and other comrades who raised opinions. Commissioner Zhang Junxian also threatened: "Anyone who raises more opinions will be dealt with according to the law!" After the meeting, Gao Zaiming, the secretary of the Party branch of the prefecture's office, also asked the comrades who raised opinions at the meeting to make self-criticisms.
    In this way, none of the comrades dared to speak again. But the retaliation did not stop. Gao Zaiming lured Sun Dechang, a bad element who had been sentenced for corruption and suspended from Party membership, to frame Zuo Jiashan by promising to "restore his Party membership." Then, the leading comrades of the prefecture put a "counter-revolutionary" label on Zuo Jiashan and arrested him. However, the higher-level People's Government found that Zuo Jiashan was not a counter-revolutionary. Zuo Jiashan was released after being wrongly detained for several months, but he was given another label of "opposing the leadership and sabotaging the Three-Anti Campaign" and was punished with expulsion from the Party (without administrative punishment).
    The comrades were afraid of suffering the same fate as Zuo Jiashan, and for a year, no one dared to say anything about this matter. The Party's handling of the Huang Yifeng incident encouraged me. Now I am exposing this matter.
      Editor's note: Zhang Junxian, Commissioner of the Weinan Prefecture, and others actually suppressed mass criticism and framed and attacked cadres who raised opinions during last year's "Three-Anti" movement. The problem is serious. It is recommended that the Shaanxi Provincial People's Supervisory Committee seriously handle this serious incident of suppressing criticism and thoroughly examine the work of the Weinan Prefecture.

### 渭南专署专员张俊贤等压制批评陷害干部左嘉善

专栏：读者来信摘要

    渭南专署专员张俊贤等压制批评陷害干部左嘉善
    卫忠堂来信：陕西渭南专署干部左嘉善因为在三反运动中揭露了领导干部违反财经纪律等错误行为，受到了严重的报复和迫害。
    一九四九年，渭南专署动用公款三亿多元做生意，赚了钱也不作交代。一九五○年清理仓库时，专署又买了大批布匹存在私商处（结果布匹一部分霉坏了；一部分被私商卖掉，钱也拿不回来）。三反运动时，专署干部左嘉善在专署全体人员大会上对上述问题提出批评。专署政务秘书吴荣秋（直接做生意的人，和存布的私商是亲戚）当场大发雷霆，把左嘉善和其它提意见的同志痛骂了一顿。专员张俊贤又威胁说：“谁要再提意见，就要法办！”会后，专署机关党支部书记高再明又让在会上提意见的同志作检讨。
    这样，同志们谁也不敢再讲话了。但报复却并没有停止。高再明又以“恢复党籍”的条件，利诱因贪污被判徒刑和停止党籍的坏分子孙德昌来陷害左嘉善。接着，专署领导同志以“反革命”做帽子把左嘉善逮捕了。但上级人民政府查明左嘉善不是反革命分子。左嘉善被平白扣了几个月后放出来了，但却又被换上一顶“反对领导、破坏三反”的帽子，受到了开除党籍的处分（没受行政处分）。
    同志们怕遭到左嘉善一样的命运，一年来，对这件事谁也不敢言语。党对黄逸峰事件的处理鼓舞了我。我现在把这件事揭发出来。
      编者按：渭南专署专员张俊贤等在去年“三反”运动中竟然压制群众批评，陷害、打击提意见的干部，问题是严重的。建议陕西省人民监察委员会严肃处理这一压制批评的严重事件，并彻底检查渭南专署的工作。
