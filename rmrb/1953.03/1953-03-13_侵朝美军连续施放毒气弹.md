(Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 6th) US aggressor troops in Korea have recently continuously released poison gas bombs on the positions of the Korean and Chinese People's forces.

　　After suffering a disastrous defeat in the so-called "assault" on Hill 205 northwest of Tieyuan on January 25, the enemy, disregarding international law, released poison gas bombs twice on our army's positions. The first time was at 4:00 PM on January 31, when the enemy first bombarded our army's positions with artillery fire, and then launched multiple poison gas bombs at our positions. The second time was at 1:30 AM on February 5, when the enemy carried out heavy shelling on our positions, including three poison gas bombs. These poison gas bombs were both suffocating and toxic, emitting white or colorless gas after exploding.

　　In addition, at 3:00 PM on February 4, the enemy also fired a poison gas bomb at Guicun-ri, south of Shuning. The poison gas bomb emitted a yellowish-green gas after exploding. At 8:00 AM on February 18, the enemy fired three poison gas bombs at our army's positions north of Songyu Village, southwest of Lianchuan. These were all toxic poison gas bombs with a bitter and spicy taste.

    侵朝美军连续施放毒气弹
   【新华社朝鲜前线六日电】美国侵略军最近在朝鲜前线连续向朝中人民部队施放毒气弹。
    敌人在一月二十五日向铁原西北二零五高地发动的所谓突击战遭到惨败后，竟不顾国际公法向我军阵地施放了两次毒气弹。第一次在一月三十一日下午四时，敌军先以炮火向我军阵地猛烈轰击，然后向我军阵地放射毒气弹多枚；第二次在二月五日一时半，敌人向我军阵地施行猛烈炮击，其中有毒气弹三枚。这些毒气弹都是窒息性和中毒性的，爆炸后冒出白色或无色气体。
    此外，敌军还在二月四日下午三时，向朔宁以南贵存里发射毒气弹一枚，毒气弹爆炸后冒出黄绿色气体。二月十八日八时，敌军向涟川西南松隅村北山我军阵地发射毒气弹三枚，都是中毒性的毒气弹，其味苦而辣。
