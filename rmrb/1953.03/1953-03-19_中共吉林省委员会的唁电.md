Condolences from the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia:

    All Communist Party members and the people of Jilin Province, China, were deeply saddened to hear of the unfortunate passing of Comrade Klement Gottwald, Chairman of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and President of the Czechoslovak Republic.

    Comrade Gottwald was an outstanding leader of the Czechoslovak people. He fought tirelessly for the liberation of the Czechoslovak working class and working people. During World War II, he led the Czechoslovak people in a tenacious battle against fascist Germany. After the war, he led the Czechoslovak people in economic recovery and construction, and guided them towards socialism.

    Comrade Gottwald was an outstanding fighter in the world's camp of peace and democracy. The passing of Comrade Gottwald is not only a major loss for the Communist Party and people of Czechoslovakia, but also an irreplaceable loss for the Communist Party and people of China, and for all peace-loving and democratic people around the world. In these days of mourning for Comrade Gottwald, we must strengthen the unity and friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia and fight to consolidate the world's camp of peace and democracy, headed by the Soviet Union.

                        The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    中共吉林省委员会的唁电捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会：
    中国吉林省全体共产党员和全省人民听到捷克斯洛伐克共产党主席、捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志不幸逝世的消息，感到非常悲痛。
    哥特瓦尔德同志是捷克斯洛伐克人民杰出的领袖，他为捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级和劳动人民的解放事业进行了不倦的斗争。在第二次世界大战时，他领导着捷克斯洛伐克人民对法西斯德国进行了顽强的战斗；在战后，他领导着捷克斯洛伐克人民进行了经济的恢复和建设，并领导捷克斯洛伐克人民向社会主义前进。
    哥特瓦尔德同志是世界和平民主阵营卓越的斗士。哥特瓦尔德同志的逝世，不仅是捷克斯洛伐克共产党和人民的重大损失，而且是中国共产党和中国人民及全世界爱好和平民主人民的不可弥补的损失。在这个悼念哥特瓦尔德同志的日子里，我们要加强中捷两国人民的团结友谊，为巩固以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营而斗争。
                        中国共产党吉林省委员会
