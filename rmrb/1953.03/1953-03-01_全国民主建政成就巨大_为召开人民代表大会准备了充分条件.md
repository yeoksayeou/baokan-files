Xinhua News Agency, February 28th: Over the past three years, the national democratic political construction work has made great achievements. People's Representative Conferences of all circles have been universally held in all provinces (cities), counties, and townships (villages), greatly enhancing the political enthusiasm of the people. The broad masses of the people have gained experience in democratic elections, which has fully prepared conditions for convening local people's congresses at all levels and the National People's Congress.

People's Representative Conferences of all circles have been held successively in all provinces (cities), counties, and townships (villages) across the country. According to available statistics, all twenty-nine provinces in the country, except for the newly established Jiangsu and Sichuan provinces, have held People's Representative Conferences of all circles. Before the establishment of Jiangsu and Sichuan provinces, they were originally divided into two administrative regions, Southern Jiangsu and Northern Jiangsu, and four administrative regions, Eastern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, Southern Sichuan, and Northern Sichuan. All six administrative regions had held People's Representative Conferences of all circles. Of the 159 cities in the country, except for six newly established cities, the remaining 153 cities have held People's Representative Conferences of all circles. Of the 2,167 counties and county-level administrative units in the country, except for 38 newly established counties, the remaining 2,129 units have held People's Representative Conferences of all circles. More than 280,000 townships (villages) across the country have held People's Representative Conferences or Peasant Representative Conferences. Over the past three years, the number of times that People's Representative Conferences at all levels and of all circles have been held is generally eight or nine times for counties, and as many as fifteen or sixteen times in some cases; generally eight or nine times for cities, and as many as more than twenty times in some cases; and even more times for township (village) People's Representative Conferences. Provinces also convened them on time.

The People's Representative Conferences of all circles held in various places have greatly brought into play the enthusiasm of the people in managing state affairs. The people in various places actively participated in the discussion of government work and the election of representatives. More than 20 days before the People's Representative Conference of all circles was held in Wannian County, Jiangxi Province, in January of last year, the county People's Government's work report and work plan were printed and distributed to the people in various townships for discussion and to solicit their opinions. The vast majority of people in the county participated in the discussion. When the fourth first session of the People's Representative Conference of all circles was held in Beijing in August of last year, the number of people participating in the election of representatives in large enterprises accounted for an average of more than 85% of the total number of employees, and some units, such as the Beijing Trolleybus Company, reached 97%. The resolutions made after discussions at the People's Representative Conferences of all circles were fully implemented by the people. After the People's Representative Conference was held in Anshan City in May of last year, a production upsurge was immediately set off. The original plan for local state-owned enterprises to increase production and practice economy was equivalent to 42,000 tons of grain, but after discussion by employees, it was increased to 68,000 tons. After the People's Representative Conference of all circles in Lin County, former Pingyuan Province, passed the resolution on afforestation, the people of the whole county actively participated in tree planting, and afforested more than 1,000 mu in a short period of time. Everyone said: "This is something we proposed ourselves, and we must do it on time!" The people enthusiastically love and support the county heads and township (village) heads they elected. After the county head of Rong County, Guangxi Province, was elected, he was embraced by the representatives onto the rostrum and warmly applauded and cheered. The masses outside the venue crowded the streets to welcome the county head and members of the People's Government to parade. People kept offering flowers on both sides of the street. Xishimen Village, Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, suffered a hailstorm during the People's Representative Conference of all circles in the county. The farmers in the village were afraid that Yang Yongchang, the representative attending the meeting, would not be able to concentrate on the meeting, so they sent someone to the city to comfort Yang Yongchang and said: "Although the family has suffered a disaster, our mutual aid group is rushing to replant the crops. You just focus on holding the meeting well and electing a good county head."

After more than three years of democratic life in the People's Representative Conferences of all circles, the people have learned how to be masters of their own affairs and have the experience of exercising democratic rights. Before the People's Representative Conferences of all circles were held, the people widely put forward opinions on various tasks, which were handed over to the people's representatives to bring to the meeting for discussion. A People's Representative Conference of all circles in Bengbu City, Anhui Province, once received more than 3,000 proposals last year, including production, employee welfare, medical and health care, and Hui education. A total of 4,413 proposals were received during the first session of the Second People's Representative Conference of all circles held in Zhejiang Province in December of last year. The people in various places are very cautious about electing representatives to participate in the People's Representative Conference. A woman in the original Fourth District of Beijing spent two days investigating and visiting in order to understand the history of a district candidate. When Dong Xingwu, a peasant representative from Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, was elected by the masses as a representative to attend the county People's Representative Conference, he said: "As a representative, I must not only do a good job in accordance with the entrustment of the 2,700 people in my township, but also consider the interests of the 630,000 people in the whole county." The representatives elected by the people fully demonstrated the spirit of being masters of their own affairs at the People's Representative Conferences of all circles. They often praised and criticized the working cadres. At a People's Representative Conference of all circles in Yanggao County, former Chahar Province, the representatives criticized nine cadres and praised fifteen cadres. The criticized cadres all made self-criticisms in front of the masses and resolved to correct the shortcomings in their work.

Most of the representatives attending the People's Representative Conferences of all circles in various places are now produced by direct or indirect elections. Some counties' People's Representative Conferences of all circles have reached the point where all representatives are produced by elections. In the first few People's Representative Conferences of all circles in various places, most of the representatives were recommended or invited. In the case where the people had not yet been universally organized not long after liberation, the adoption of these methods to produce representatives once guaranteed the breadth and representativeness of the representatives. After the people were organized and became familiar with the political representatives among them, the methods of producing representatives in various places gradually shifted from recommendation and invitation to election by the people. In the first election of peasant representatives to the People's Representative Conference of all circles in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, the peasant associations of townships and villages had just begun to be established and had few members. Therefore, village representatives were recommended on a village-by-village basis and then concentrated in the township to recommend formal county representatives. In the second election, the peasant representative conferences of various townships had been established and improved, so county representatives were elected at the township peasant representative conferences. At present, representatives produced by election in general areas have reached more than 80% of the total number of representatives. According to statistics from 57 counties in Fujian Province, there are 39 counties where representatives produced by election account for more than 80% of the total number of representatives, of which 17 counties such as Jianyang and Zhenghe account for more than 90%. Sichuan is a province that was liberated relatively late, but the representatives to the People's Representative Conferences of all circles in nine counties such as Nanchong and Guangyuan in the province also accounted for more than 80% to 90% of the total number of representatives in each county produced by election, of which Guangyuan County reached 98%. Some county's representatives, such as Yonghe, Shenchi, Pianguan, Wuzhai, and Zuoquan in Shanxi Province, Liuhe and Fusong in Liaodong Province, and Shaowu and Haicheng counties in Fujian Province, have reached 100% produced by election. Last year, a total of 13,637,000 representatives attended the People's Representative Conferences at all levels and of all circles across the country. These representatives are model figures, activists, and representative figures among the people. This has laid a good foundation for convening local people's congresses at all levels and the National People's Congress.

The People's Representative Conferences of all circles in most parts of the country are constantly developing. The first People's Representative Conferences of all circles in various cities and counties were convened not long after the local liberation. For example, Baoding City, Hebei Province, was liberated in November 1948, and the People's Representative Conference of all circles was convened in January 1949; Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, was liberated in May 1949, and the People's Representative Conference of all circles was convened in September of the same year. At these meetings, the负责人 responsible persons of the People's Government reported on various tasks to the representatives present, explained various policies and decrees with examples, and listened to the representatives' opinions and criticisms of the work with an open mind, which strengthened the people's understanding and trust in the People's Government and smoothly promoted the work. After holding one or two People's Representative Conferences of all circles, the representatives realized the nature and significance of the meeting, understood the role of the meeting, and thus their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility were enhanced, and they repeatedly discussed the work reports and work plans of the People's Government. The central tasks of the People's Government were all made resolutions at these meetings and then completed jointly with the people. After a period of time, the people have had some experience in exercising democratic rights, and the local social reforms have been basically completed. With the approval of the People's Government at a higher level, the People's Representative Conference exercises the functions and powers of the People's Congress and elects the government committee. According to existing statistics, the People's Representative Conferences of all circles in 20 provinces, 102 cities, and 811 counties across the country have exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress and elected the government committees at all levels. The People's Representative Conferences or township (village) Peasant Representative Conferences in more than 280,000 townships (villages) across the country have generally exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress and elected the township (village) People's Government committees. In some ethnic minority areas, the People's Representative Conferences of all ethnic groups and circles have elected the people's government committees of ethnic autonomous regions or the committees of the ethnic democratic joint governments. The provision in the Common Program that "before the convocation of the local people's congresses by universal suffrage, the local people's representative conferences of all circles shall gradually exercise the functions and powers of the people's congresses" in order to achieve the people's congresses by universal suffrage has been proven to be completely correct in the process of democratic political construction over the past three years. At present, military operations on the mainland have ended, land reform has been basically completed, people from all walks of life have been organized, and they have the experience of exercising state power such as democratic elections. At the same time, facing the country's large-scale construction work, the transitional form of the People's Representative Conference of all circles can no longer meet the requirements of the broad masses of the people. Convening the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels is not only possible but also very necessary.

    全国民主建政成就巨大
    为召开人民代表大会准备了充分条件
    【新华社二十八日讯】三年多来，全国民主政权建设工作有很大的成就。各省（市）、县、乡（村）普遍举行了各界人民代表会议，人民群众的政治积极性大大提高，广大人民都有了民主选举的经验，已为召开地方各级人民代表大会及全国人民代表大会准备了充分条件。
    全国各省（市）、县、乡（村）已先后举行了各界人民代表会议。据现有材料统计：全国二十九个省，除新建的江苏和四川两省外，都已开过各界人民代表会议；江苏和四川在建省前原分为苏南、苏北两个行政区和川东、川西、川南、川北四个行政区，这六个行政区都曾开过各界人民代表会议。全国一百五十九个市，除六个新设市外，其余一百五十三个市都已开过各界人民代表会议。全国二千一百六十七个县和县级行政单位，除三十八个新设县外，其余二千一百二十九个单位都已开过各界人民代表会议。全国二十八万多个乡（村），都已开过了人民代表会议或农民代表会议。三年多来，各级各界人民代表会议开会的次数，县一般为八、九次，多的达十五、六次；市一般为八、九次，多的达二十多次；乡（村）人民代表会议开会次数更多；省也按时召开。
    各地举行的各界人民代表会议，大大发挥了人民群众管理国家事务的积极性。各地人民群众踊跃参加政府工作的讨论和选举代表的工作。江西省万年县去年一月召开各界人民代表会议前二十多天，曾将县人民政府的工作报告和工作计划印发各乡人民讨论，征询人民的意见，全县绝大多数的人都参加了讨论。北京市去年八月举行第四届第一次各界人民代表会议时，大企业中参加选举代表的人数，平均占职工总人数的百分之八十五以上，有些单位如北京电车公司达到百分之九十七。经过各界人民代表会议讨论做出的决议，人民群众以全力执行。鞍山市去年五月召开人民代表会议后，立刻掀起了生产热潮，地方国营企业各厂原布置增产节约价值折合粮食四万二千吨，经职工讨论增加到六万八千吨。原平原省林县各界人民代表会议上通过造林的决议后，全县人民积极参加植树，在短时期内造林一千多亩，大家都表示：这是我们自己提出来的事情，一定要按时办好！人民群众热烈爱戴和拥护他们选举出来的县长和乡（村）长。广西省容县人民政府县长选出后，被代表拥抱上主席台，热烈鼓掌欢呼。会外群众挤满了街道，迎接县长、人民政府委员去游行，街道两旁不断有人献花。山西省陵川县西石门村在举行县各界人民代表会议期间遭受了雹灾，该村农民怕出席会议的代表杨永昌不安心开会，特地派人到城里去安慰杨永昌说：“家里虽受了灾，有我们互助组抢种，你只管开好会，选好县长。”
    经过三年多来各界人民代表会议的民主生活的锻炼，人民群众懂得了怎样来当家作主，并且具备了行使民主权利的经验。各界人民代表会议举行前，人民群众广泛提出对各项工作的意见，交由人民代表带到会上去讨论。安徽省蚌埠市去年有一次各界人民代表会议曾收到三千多件提案，内容包括生产、职工福利、医药卫生和回民教育等。浙江省去年十二月举行二届一次各界人民代表会议期间，共收到提案四千四百一十三件。各地人民群众对于选举参加人民代表会议的代表，都很慎重。北京市原第四区有个妇女，她为了了解一个区候选人的历史，曾费了两天的时间进行调查访问。陕西省长安县农民代表董醒吾由群众选为代表去出席该县人民代表会议时，他说：“我当代表不仅要依照我乡二千七百人的委托，好好办事，而且要替全县六十三万人的利益着想。”由人民群众选举的代表，在各界人民代表会议上充分表现了当家作主的精神，他们对于工作干部经常进行表扬和批评。原察哈尔省阳高县有一次各界人民代表会议上，代表们对九个干部提出批评，对十五个干部提出表扬。受到批评的干部都在群众面前作了自我批评，决心改正工作上的缺点。
    各地出席各界人民代表会议的代表，现在已绝大部分由直接选举或间接选举产生。有些县的各界人民代表会议的代表已经达到全部由选举产生。各地最初几次各界人民代表会议的代表，大多是推选或邀请的。在解放不久、人民群众还没有普遍地组织起来的情况下，采用这些方式产生代表，曾经保证了代表的广泛性和代表性。在人民群众组织起来并熟悉了他们中间的政治代表人物以后，各地产生代表的方式，便逐渐从推选和邀请进到由人民选举。陕西省长安县各界人民代表会议的农民代表，在第一次选举时，乡和村的农民协会才开始建立，会员尚少，因此以村为单位推出村代表再集中到乡推选正式县代表；第二次选举时，各乡农民代表会议已经建立和健全，于是便在乡农民代表会议上选举县代表。目前，一般地区由选举产生的代表已经达到代表总数的百分之八十以上。据福建省五十七个县的统计：由选举产生的代表占代表总数百分之八十以上的有三十九个县，其中建阳、政和等十七个县则在百分之九十以上。四川是解放较晚的一个省，但该省南充、广元等九个县各界人民代表会议的代表，由选举产生的也占各该县代表总数的百分之八十以上到九十以上，其中广元县到了百分之九十八。有些县的代表，如山西省的永和、神池、偏关、五寨、左权，辽东省的柳河、抚松和福建省的邵武和海澄县，已经达到百分之百是由选举产生的。去年全国出席各级各界人民代表会议的代表共达一千三百六十三万七千多人，这些代表都是人民群众中的模范人物和积极分子和有代表性的人士。这给召开地方各级及全国人民代表大会奠立了良好的基础。
    全国大多数地方的各界人民代表会议，是在不断地发展的。各市、县的首次各界人民代表会议，都是在当地解放不久就召开的。如河北省保定市一九四八年十一月解放，一九四九年一月就召开了各界人民代表会议；江苏省松江县一九四九年五月解放，同年九月就召开了各界人民代表会议。在这些会议上，人民政府的负责人向到会代表报告各项工作，以实例说明各项政策法令，并虚心听取代表们对工作的意见和批评，加强了人民对人民政府的了解和信任，顺利地推动了工作。在开过一次或两次各界人民代表会议之后，代表们认识了会议的性质和意义，了解了会议的作用，因而积极性和责任心提高了，对于人民政府的工作报告和工作计划进行反复讨论。人民政府的中心工作，都是在这些会议上作成决议后，协同人民群众共同完成。在经过一段时间以后，人民群众行使民主权利已有一定经验，加以当地社会改革基本完成，经上级人民政府批准，便代行人民代表大会职权，选举政府委员会。根据现有材料的统计：全国有二十个省、一百零二个市、八百一十一个县的各界人民代表会议已代行人民代表大会职权，选举了各该级的政府委员会，全国二十八万多个乡（村）的人民代表会议或乡（村）农民代表会议，一般已代行人民代表大会职权，选举乡（村）人民政府委员会。一部分少数民族地区，已由各族各界人民代表会议选举出民族自治区人民政府委员会或民族民主联合政府委员会。共同纲领中“在普选的地方人民代表大会召开以前，由地方各界人民代表会议逐步地代行人民代表大会的职权”以达到普选的人民代表大会的规定，在三年多来民主政权建设的过程中已证明是完全正确的。目前，大陆上军事行动已经结束，土地改革已经基本完成，各界人民已经组织起来，并且具备了民主选举等行使国家政权的经验；同时，面临着国家大规模的建设工作，各界人民代表会议这一过渡形式，已经不能够满足广大人民的要求，召开全国及地方各级人民代表大会不仅是可能，而且是十分必要的了。
