    A Man Who Forgets Himself
    ——People Building Anshan (3)
    By Our Correspondent Lù Hào

    Wang Jinzhong returned to Anshan with such joy.

    People got off the train, some went home, some hurried to the cafeteria to eat, only he went straight to the Seamless Steel Tube Plant construction site. As he walked, he thought about how he should report his work to the engineering team leader; for example, how the comrades completed an urgent national defense construction task twenty days ahead of schedule, and how they received the glorious title of Model Team. He also thought that if the team leader knew that the comrades had completed the work so well, he would be so happy.

    When he arrived at the team headquarters, he saw team leader Wang Zhongshan on the phone as soon as he entered. He happily said, "Team leader, we're back." After saying that, he stretched out his hot hands to shake the team leader's hand.

    Although the team leader had already seen Wang Jinzhong come in, he didn't even blink, and there was not a trace of expression on his flat face. He just waved his hand vigorously, meaning: don't disturb him. Then, he coldly replied: "Oh, you're back."

    After the team leader waved his hand, he put it down. Wang Jinzhong's outstretched hand fell empty, so he had to withdraw it. At this time, the team leader had finished his phone call.

    "Let me report the work of the team to you," Wang Jinzhong said.

    The team leader replied: "I don't have time these few days, let's talk about it later." After saying this, he started chatting with another person about something else, seemingly not at all interested in hearing any work report.

    Wang Jinzhong felt like he had been doused with a basin of cold water in the twelfth lunar month, chilling him to the heart. He was stunned for a while, and then walked out. When he walked out, team leader Wang Zhongshan didn't even look at him.

    He went to the trade union chairman, who was much more enthusiastic, but when he heard that Wang Jinzhong wanted to report his work, he said that he was very busy, repeatedly saying: "I have to go to a meeting right away, I have to go to a meeting right away." It seemed that he was not interested in hearing any work report either.

    Wang Jinzhong, full of enthusiasm, ran into such obstacles in several places. He was filled with anger, so he had to go home. As soon as he entered the door, he ran into his wife, and he remembered that he had not eaten yet. He said to his wife: "Get me some food."

    His wife ignored him. After waiting for a long time, she angrily asked him back: "Bring me the money." It turned out that Wang Jinzhong had been out for forty days, and he had left all the things at home behind. His wife continued: "You are really a good team leader." She still had her old opinions, like that becoming a team leader made him so busy that he didn't care about his family, and that it would be better to do his old blacksmithing work, where he could earn more wages, and so on.

    "Why am I not doing well? We completed the task twenty days ahead of schedule and became a model team. What's wrong with that?" As he said these words, he felt more and more sad and annoyed. This iron man, during the Japanese aggressors' rule, had personally beaten the Japanese who bullied him; in the recently built national defense project, he risked his life to save thousands of bags of cement. He could withstand any difficulty or danger, but at this time, tears couldn't stop flowing down. He couldn't bear it anymore, covered himself with the quilt and cried.

    At first, he sobbed and didn't want to cry out loud, but later, he couldn't hold back and simply cried loudly, crying for more than an hour. His father, who was sitting next to him, saw this and asked Wang Jinzhong: "Are you a Communist Party member?"

    "Yes."

    "You are a Communist Party member, true gold is not afraid of fire, what's the use of crying?" His old father was a labor model who had lived in the old liberated area of Shandong for more than ten years. The old man's strong words touched Wang Jinzhong's heart. He thought: Yes, I have never been afraid of any difficulties, why am I succumbing to bureaucratic elements? So, he stopped crying, and the next day, he returned to the construction site early.

    When he returned to the construction site, he learned that his position as the leader of the squadron had been revoked, and he had been demoted to group leader. When the workers learned of this, some were so angry that they wanted to go to Wang Zhongshan to settle accounts, but Wang Jinzhong stopped them. Because Wang Jinzhong had encountered such things more than once. In the past, when he was a team leader, he was suddenly made a cook; sometimes he was a team leader, sometimes he was a group leader; but he only cared about his work and never took these things to heart.

    On the eve of the large-scale construction of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, the site was piled with thousands of tons of incomplete machines, broken and rusty window frames, and various kinds of rotten scrap metal. The sooner these things were cleared, the sooner our project could start. That was one of the most urgent tasks at that time.

    To complete a heavy task in a short period of time, no one dared to take on this task. Wang Jinzhong stepped forward at this time.

    He called a meeting and discussed with the comrades in the group how to complete this task. He calculated for a moment and asked everyone: "Can we finish it in a week?"

    Some said: "Two or three weeks won't be enough." Some said: "It's going to be tough."

    "If we want to do it, I think we can finish it in five days. If we don't want to do it, we won't finish it in a year."

    One worker heard his words and shouted: "Old Wang, you are still so silly, if you keep working like this, I think you will be fired."

    "Please don't worry about that for me. I am a Communist Party member. We work for the Party and for the people!"

    People became active after hearing Wang Jinzhong's words. They rushed to say: "We believe in you, we will definitely work like you."

    They rummaged through the scrap metal piles and found crooked light rails. They removed screws from the lying-down broken trams. They didn't even have ordinary wrenches or pliers. They straightened the rails and repaired them into temporary light railways, and pieced together scattered old wheels to assemble many small handcarts. Originally, the site director estimated that it would take a thousand workdays to complete these tasks. In fact, it took less than five days and only one hundred and eighty workdays to complete everything.

    Sure enough, true gold is not afraid of fire. Wang Jinzhong's team had become the heart of the concrete team, and the construction site could not do without them for a moment. Whenever there were particularly urgent tasks, the site director would ask them to solve them. Not only could they complete the tasks well every time, but they often completed tasks that the leadership planned would take ten days in less than a week. Once, when pushing slag with small handcarts, others pushed eight carts a day with three people, but they could push twenty-seven carts a day with three people. Because of their outstanding work, the trade union awarded them a model banner, but later, they worked even harder and pushed ninety-eight carts a day with two people. In front of them, making plans became a very difficult task.

    In our era, the heroic deeds will not be buried. Later, the bureaucratic element Wang Zhongshan was finally removed from his post, and Wang Jinzhong quickly became the captain of the concrete team again.

    Not long after the project started, it coincided with the rainy season. Heavy rain poured down, and the factory foundation and the already excavated foundations were filled with water, flowing with a rushing sound. In the foundation more than four meters deep, the bottom of the 13th pillar was falling right on the steel frame, and the steel frame was propped up by the timbers at both ends. This large pillar was connected to the entire steel framework of the entire complex factory building. The flood fiercely rushed from the roof and all sides towards the foundation of this pillar. The water hit the timber frame, and the waves splashed, creating a very dangerous situation. If the flood washed away the timbers, causing the base of the pillar to collapse, the entire framework might collapse, and the entire project on the construction site might have to be completely stopped.

    At this time, Wang Jinzhong was eating. The news of the danger at the base of the pillar exploded in the canteen like a bomb. Wang Jinzhong threw down his rice bowl, ignoring the heavy rain pouring on his head, and rushed straight to the factory building. People followed in droves.

    Just entering the factory building, several surveyors walked out, their faces changed color. Ignoring how muddy the ground was, they stumbled and crawled out. When they saw Wang Jinzhong and the workers running in, they had to shyly slow down and turn around to make way.

    The rain was falling even harder. The timbers were being impacted by the flood, and it seemed that they had already moved a little. In that foundation, only the section chief Su Dianchen was inside, laboriously moving the timbers. The timbers were large, and the person's strength was small, and the rain was pouring on his head so he couldn't open his eyes, and he couldn't solve any problem. Several people were shouting chaotically on the edge of the foundation. They were frightened by this dangerous situation and didn't know what to do.

    This was a moment full of danger. People had to jump down below the base of the pillar, stand between the timbers, and prop up the timbers at both ends so that they would not be moved by any flood and keep the base of the pillar stable. But if people jumped in, if the timbers changed, people would be crushed in the middle and squeezed into meat paste. As soon as Wang Jinzhong arrived, he jumped in with a whoosh, jumping into the most dangerous timbers and standing under the steel frame. He immediately became the commander of this battle. He told the workers where to lift the timbers and where to lift the mats, because he usually paid attention, so he knew where everything was in his mind. Seeing Wang Jinzhong doing this, everyone jumped down one after another, some moving the timbers, some lifting the mats, and some unhesitatingly climbed onto the dangerous pillar and took the mats to the roof to block the rain. People were one by one like they had been fished out of the river, covered in water. Finally, the timbers were propped up, the welders rushed to weld the base of the pillar to the steel frame, and they overcame this danger.

    Wang Jinzhong is like this, the construction site cannot do without him, and he cannot do without the construction site. During the most intense period of the pouring project in August, he stayed at the base day and night. Often, people forced him to go back to sleep. He lay at home for a while, then ran back again. Once, as soon as he went home to sleep, he started dreaming. In his dream, he was also tamping cement, tamping and tamping, and suddenly his hand landed on the little girl next to him. The little girl cried loudly. Wang Jinzhong turned on the light, and his little daughter's nose was broken and bleeding. His wife was also awakened, and when she saw this situation, she said: "Hey, you've gone crazy lately." Wang Jinzhong didn't say anything, he just put on his clothes, buttoning them as he walked towards the construction site. The construction site was seven or eight li away from his home. He often slept until midnight, unable to sleep, and came to the construction site. Tonight, as he walked, he thought: When should the task of the night shift last night be completed, and what should the day shift today do?

    It was more than two o'clock in the middle of the night, and many people were already asleep. Only the chimneys of the Iron and Steel Company were spitting out sparks in the dark night, like ten thousand people holding giant torches high in the sky, illuminating the sky and changing its color. In the factory buildings and on the construction site, thousands of electric lights were connected to form a dazzling light. As soon as Wang Jinzhong arrived at the construction site, he saw the workers resting on the foundation. He said: "Comrades, how is the work going?"

    People happily replied: "We have already finished it. Please assign some other work to do."

    The work that was expected to be completed at seven o'clock this morning was unexpectedly completed by the night shift comrades of the concrete team before three o'clock.

    So he went to the construction site office to request new work tasks. When he arrived there, people had already left work and no one could be found. At this time, the telephone was ringing loudly. He picked up the telephone, and only heard the other party shouting angrily:

    "Are you the person in charge? Why don't you answer the phone?"

    Wang Jinzhong looked around and there was no one else around. He thought, I'll be the person in charge for the time being. He replied: "Tell me, I can be responsible."

    The other party initially criticized the construction site office for not having anyone to answer the phone, and then raised the problem, saying that they were from the transportation department and there were five train cars that had not been unloaded at the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, which not only blocked the line, but also meant that no other train cars would be sent to the construction site tomorrow.

    Wang Jinzhong knew that although this matter was not directly related to the concrete team, it was closely related to the work of his construction site. He said without hesitation: "That's easy to say, I guarantee it will be unloaded in a while."

    The originally irritable tone on the phone suddenly turned into a voice full of gratitude after hearing his words.

    Wang Jinzhong ran to the site, where the workers were waiting anxiously. They asked: "Is there any work to do?"

    He told the whole story from beginning to end, and the workers said: "Then what's the problem, we guarantee to solve it." They quickly found the five train cars and started working.

    When these train cars were unloaded, the bright morning had arrived again. It is not surprising that this morning, like yesterday, and like the mornings in these tense days on the construction site, no one even knew when the sky began to light up. (Attached picture)

    一个忘记自己的人
    ——建设鞍山的人们之三
    本报记者　陆灏
    王进忠是那样高兴地回到了鞍山。
    人们下了火车，有的回家去了，有的赶紧上食堂吃饭去，只有他一个人直向无缝工地走去。他一面走，一面想着应该怎样向工程队大队长报告工作；譬如同志们怎样提前二十天完成了一项紧急的修建国防工程的任务，怎样得到了模范队的光荣称号，他还想到，要是大队长知道了同志们这样出色地完成了工作，不知要多么高兴呢。
    到了队部，他一进门，就看见大队长王忠山在打电话。他满怀欣喜地说：“队长，我们回来了。”说完话，他把两只手火热热地伸出去，要去拉队长的手。
    大队长虽然已经见到王进忠走进来，但他的眼皮眨也不眨，他的平板的脸孔上一点点表情也没有，只用手使劲一摆，意思是说：不要扰乱他。然后，冷冷地回答说：“哦，回来啦。”
    队长的手摆了一下以后，就放下去了，王进忠伸出去的手落了空，只好缩了回来。这时间，大队长的电话已经讲完了。
    “我把队上的工作向你报告报告吧。”王进忠说。
    大队长回答说：“这几天没有空，以后再说吧。”他说完这句话，和另外一个人不知扯什么别的事情去了，他似乎根本没有兴趣想听什么工作报告。
    王进忠像在腊月里被泼了一盆冷水，一直凉到心里，他愣了一会儿，就走了出来，他走出来时。队长王忠山看也没有看他。
    他到了工会主席那里，工会主席倒是热情得多，但他听见王进忠要报告工作，就表示自己非常忙，连说：“我要马上开会去，要马上开会去。”看样子，对于听什么工作报告，也是没有什么兴趣。
    抱着满腔热情的王进忠，在好几个地方碰了这样的钉子，他蹩了一肚子气，只好回到家里去。一进门，就碰上他的老婆，他才想起自己还没有吃饭，他对他老婆说：“拿饭来吃吧。”
    老婆没有理他，等了好大一会，她生气地反问他：“你拿钱来。”原来王进忠出门四十天，他把家里的事都丢在脑后头。他的老婆接着说：“你这个队长当得真好。”她还是原来那一套老意见，什么当了队长忙得家里也不管啦，什么不如去干原来打铁的老手艺还可以多挣工资等等。
    “我为什么当得不好？提前二十天完成了任务，当了模范队，有什么不好呢？”他一面在说这些话，一面心里就越想越难过，越想越蹩气。这个铁汉子，在日本侵略者的统治时期，曾经亲自揍过欺侮他的日本人；在最近修建的国防工程中，他冒着生命的危险，抢救了千百包洋灰，什么困难，什么危险，他都经得起，但在这时候，眼泪却止不住地流下来，他实在忍不住了，蒙着被哭起来。
    他哭，一开头是呜呜咽咽，不愿哭出声音来，后来，就蹩不住了，就干脆大哭起来，一直哭了一个多钟头。坐在他旁边的他的父亲看到这样子，就问王进忠：“你是不是共产党员？”
      “是。”
      “你是个共产党员，真金不怕火来炼，哭有什么用？”他的老父亲是生活在山东老解放区十几年的一个劳动模范，这个老人的坚强的话，触动了王进忠的心，他想：对呀，什么困难也没有怕过，为什么见了官僚主义分子就吃不住了呢。于是，他就不哭了，第二天，他早早地回到了工地。
    他一回到工地，他知道中队长的职位已被撤销了，自己已经降为组长。工人们知道了这件事情，有的实在气愤不过，要去找王忠山算帐，这被王进忠制止住了。因为王进忠碰到这样的事情已经不止一次，他过去也曾经在当队长的时候，忽然让他当炊事员；一会儿又当队长，一会儿又让他当组长；但他自己只顾工作，从来不把这些事情放在心上。
    在无缝工地大规模工程开工的前夕，现场上堆满了千百吨的残缺的机器、破锈的窗架以及各种各样的烂铁皮坏零件。这些东西早清扫一天，我们的工程就可以早动工一天。那是当时最迫切的工作之一。
    很短的时间，要完成很重的工作，没有人敢担负这个任务。王进忠在这时候挺身而出。
    他召集会议，和组里的同志们商量如何完成这个工作。他盘算了一下，问大家：“一个礼拜，干完了吗？”
    有人说：“两三个礼拜也干不完。”有人说：“够瞧的。”
    “要干，我看五天就干完了，要不干，一年也干不完。”
    有一个工人听了他的话，喊叫着说：“老王，你还那么傻，再干，我看你就要被开除了。”
    “请你不要为我考虑这一点，我是共产党员，我们是为党工作，为人民工作啊！”
    人们听了王进忠的话，就活跃起来了。他们抢着说：“我们相信你，我们一定像你一样干。”
    他们从废铁堆里翻出来弯弯扭扭的轻便铁轨，在躺着的破电车上卸下了螺丝，连普通的扳子和钳子也没有，他们把铁轨弄直了修成临时的轻便铁道，把零散在角角落落的旧轱辘拼凑起来，装成了很多小手车。本来现场主任估计弄完这些东西需要一千个工，实际上，不到五天，用了一百八十个工就全部干完了。
    果然，真金不怕火来炼，王进忠领导的那个小组，简直是成了混凝土队的心脏，工地上一刻也离不开他们。凡是逢上了特别紧急的工作，工地主任就要请他们去解决，他们不但每一次都能很好完成任务，而且常常是领导上计划需要十天才能作完的工作，他们不到一个礼拜就作完了。有一次用小手车推矿渣，别人干是三个人一天推八车，他们三个人干，一天就能推到二十七车。由于他们杰出的劳动，工会授给了他们模范的奖旗，但后来他们再使劲一干，竟做到两个人一天推九十八车。在他们的面前，订计划变成一件很困难的工作了。
    在我们这个时代里，英雄的事迹是不会被湮没的。后来，官僚主义分子王忠山终于被撤职了，王进忠很快又担任了混凝土队的队长。
    工程开始进行不久以后，正逢上雨季，倾盆大雨直泻下来，厂房地基和已经挖好的基础里，到处淌满了水，哗哗而流。在四公尺多深的基础里，十三号柱子的底柱正落在钢架上，钢架是被两头的道木堆垫起来的。这根大柱子，它牵连着全部厂房整个错综复杂的钢的房架。大水从房顶和四面朝这个柱子的基础里凶恶地冲过来，水头碰在道木架上，浪花四溅，造成一种非常危险的境况。如果大水把道木冲垮，使柱脚落空，整个房架就有可能陷塌下来，工地全部的工程就有可能要全部停顿。
    这时王进忠正在吃饭，柱脚发生危险的消息，像颗炸弹一样在饭堂里爆炸，王进忠扔下饭碗，顾不得头上浇着大雨，直奔厂房。人们都一窝蜂地跟着跑来。
    刚进厂房，迎面有几个测量员走出来，他们的脸孔变了颜色，不顾地上多么泥泞，跌跌爬爬往外走，他们见王进忠和工人们往里跑，自己就只好羞怯地放慢了自己的脚步，转过头来让路。
    雨，更大地下着，道木被大水冲击着，仿佛已经有一点点移动。那基础里，只有工段主任苏殿臣在里头，费力地搬动道木，道木大，人的气力小，雨浇在头上眼睛也睁不开，不能解决任何问题。有几个人，在基础上边乱嚷嚷，他们是被这危险的情况吓坏了，不知如何是好。
    这是一个充满了危险的时刻。人们必须跳到柱脚的下面去，站在道木中间，把两头的道木顶住，使它不被任何大水冲动，保持柱脚底座的稳固。但人如果跳进去，道木万一发生变化，人就要被压在当中，挤成肉酱。王进忠一来到，他就唰的往里一跳，跳在那最危险的道木中间，站在那钢架的下边。他马上变成这一场战斗的指挥员，他告诉工人，那里去抬道木，那里去抬席子，因为他平常留意，所以什么东西在什么地方，都在他的心里装着。大家看见王进忠这样做，就纷纷接着跳下去，搬道木的搬道木，抬席子的抬席子，有的就毫不犹豫地爬上那根危险的柱子，把席子带到房顶上去，挡住雨水。人们一个一个像从河里捞出来的一样，全身是水，最后，道木终被顶住了，电焊匠赶来把柱脚焊在钢架上，度过了这一场危险。
    王进忠，就是这样，工地离不开他，他离不开工地。在八月份浇灌工程最紧张的时候，他白天黑夜都不离基础，常常人们强迫要他回去睡觉，他在家里躺了一会儿，又跑回来了。有一次，他刚回家睡觉，一睡就做起梦来，梦里他也在捣固洋灰，捣呀捣呀，一下子手落在他身边的小女孩身上，小女孩哇哇地哭起来了。王进忠一开电灯，小女儿的鼻子给他打破流出血来了，他老婆也被吵醒，一见这情形，说：“哎，你最近疯了。”王进忠不作声，他自己只管穿衣服，一面扣钮子；一面就往工地走。工地离他家，有七、八里路，他常常睡到半夜，睡不着，就到工地上来。今天晚上，他边走边想：昨天晚班的任务，应该在什么时候完，今天白班应该干些什么。
    这正是半夜两点多钟，很多人都已经睡了，唯有钢铁公司的烟囱，在漆黑的夜里喷吐着火花，像万人在天空中高举着那巨型的火把，把天空都照耀得变了颜色。厂房内、工地上，那千千万万盏的电灯，连成一片闪眼的亮光。王进忠一到工地，看到工人们正在基础上休息。他说：同志们，工作怎么样了？”
    人们高兴地回答他说：“我们已经做完了，再分配点别的工作做做吧。”
    预计今天早晨七点钟完工的工作，想不到在三点多钟，混凝土队的夜班同志们就已经提前完成了。
    他于是走到工地办公室去要求新的工作任务，他到了那里，人们已经下班了，谁也找不见。这时候，电话铃正一阵一阵地响得厉害，他拿起电话机，只听见对方怒气冲冲地在喊叫：
      “你是负责人吗？为什么不接电话？”
    王进忠一看旁边也没有别人，他想，我就暂时当
    一下负责人吧。他答复说：“你说吧，我能负责。”
    对方开头是批评工地办公室不应该没有人接电话，后来就提出了问题，说他们是运输部的，有五个车皮在无缝工地没有卸下来，这不但堵塞了线路，同时明天也没有别的车皮再给工地送料。
    王进忠知道这事情虽然与混凝土队没有直接联系，但与自己工地的工作却大有关系，他毫不迟疑地说：“那好说，等一会保管能卸完。”
    电话里本来很烦躁的口气，听了他的话就忽然变成充满了感谢的声音了。
    王进忠跑到了现场，工人们正等得着急。他们问：“有活干吗？”
    他把这件事从头到尾讲了一遍，工人们说：“那还有什么问题，我们保管解决。”他们很快寻到了那五个车皮，开始工作起来。
    当卸完这些车皮的时候，灿烂的早晨又已经来了。说来也并不奇怪，这一天的早晨，和昨天，和在工地上这些紧张的日子里的早晨一样，人们竟谁也不知道天是在什么时候开始亮的。（附图片）
