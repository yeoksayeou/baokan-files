Xinhua News Agency, Manila, 2nd: The Second Trade Promotion Conference of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East opened in Manila on February 23rd. Participants included representatives from Asian and Far Eastern countries, colonial powers such as the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands, as well as the Soviet Union. The conference studied the significant deterioration of Asian trade and markets caused by the predatory trade policies of colonial powers and held heated debates surrounding the issue of stabilizing world market prices.

Many Asian countries' representatives spoke at the meeting about the severe consequences that unstable raw material prices in the market have caused to their countries. Indian representative Baig said: One of the "most pressing problems" for Asia and the Far East is the trade imbalance caused by "a sharp increase in imports and a decrease in exports. The increase in imports is due to the high prices of imported goods, and the decrease in exports is due to the reduction in raw material prices." The Indonesian representative said that the sharp drop in Indonesian rubber prices in 1952 severely hampered one of Indonesia's main sources of foreign exchange, preventing Indonesia from purchasing the rice it needed.

The Thai representative proposed a suggestion on stabilizing world market prices at the meeting, which was supported by representatives from India, the Philippines, and other countries. Representatives from the United States and Britain insisted on their policy of extracting raw materials from Asian countries at low prices and opposed the suggestion, arguing that stabilizing prices was "difficult to achieve."

According to "Pravda" special correspondent Orestov from Manila: Five days into the conference, the issue of stabilizing world market prices remained the central focus of attention. Some representatives, such as the Indonesian representative, suggested adopting a so-called barter system based on the direct exchange of goods. However, representatives from the United States and Britain opposed this suggestion, hoping that all trade with Asian countries would be calculated in US dollars and pounds sterling, making it easier for imperialism to plunder Asian countries.

Soviet representative Kamensky pointed out that ten countries in Asia and the Far East had a surplus of 748 million US dollars in the first half of 1951, but due to the decline in prices of Asian countries' exports, they had a deficit of 876 million US dollars in the same period in 1952. This was mainly because the United States tried to drive down the prices of raw materials, stockpiled large quantities of raw materials, and used these inventories to influence the raw materials market. The deterioration of trade was also due to the economic blockade actually imposed on China and the artificial restriction of trade between Asian countries and the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. The Soviet representative pointed out that Asian countries face difficulties in selling their goods and obtaining the items and raw materials necessary for developing their industries, but these difficulties could be overcome to a considerable extent if they developed trade with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies.

    苏联代表在亚洲与远东经济委员会二届贸易促进会议上
    揭露美国对亚洲国家的掠夺性贸易政策
    【新华社二日讯】马尼拉消息：联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会第二届贸易促进会议二月二十三日在马尼拉开幕。参加会议的包括亚洲与远东国家和美、英、法、荷等殖民国家及苏联的代表。会议研究了因殖民国家的掠夺性贸易政策而造成的亚洲贸易和市场显著恶化的情况，并围绕着稳定世界市场物价问题进行了激烈的辩论。
    许多亚洲国家的代表在会上谈到，市场上原料价格的不稳定，已经给他们的国家造成了严重恶果。印度代表巴伊格说：亚洲和远东地区“最迫切的问题之一是因输入剧增和输出减少而引起的贸易差额，输入剧增是由于输入货物价格高昂，输出减少则是因为原料价格降低。”印尼代表说，一九五二年印尼橡胶价格大跌，印尼取得外汇的主要来源之一受到严重妨害，因而印尼无法购买它所需要的大米。
    泰国代表在会上提出了稳定世界市场价格的建议，并得到印度、菲律宾等国代表的支持。美国和英国的代表坚持以贱价榨取亚洲国家原料的政策，反对这个建议，认为稳定物价“很难办得到”。
    据“真理报”特派记者奥雷斯托夫自马尼拉报道：会议进行了五天以后，稳定世界市场物价的问题仍是会议所注意的中心。某些代表，例如印尼代表，建议采用以直接交换货物为基础的所谓以货易货制。但是美国和英国代表反对这个建议，他们希望所有与亚洲国家进行的贸易，都用美元和英镑来计算，这可以使帝国主义更容易掠夺亚洲国家。
    苏联代表卡曼斯基指出，亚洲和远东的十个国家在一九五一年上半年出超七亿四千八百万美元，但是由于亚洲国家输出货物的价格下跌，在一九五二年同时期，它们就入超八亿七千六百万美元。这主要是因为美国设法使原料的价格下跌，它囤积大量的原料，并利用这些存货来影响原料市场。贸易情况之所以恶化，还因为实际上对中国实行的经济封锁以及人为地限制亚洲国家和苏联与人民民主国家进行贸易。苏联代表指出，亚洲国家在出售他们的货物和取得发展工业所必需的物品和原料中，是有困难的，但是如果它们与苏联、中国以及人民民主国家发展贸易的话，这种困难就可以得到相当程度的克服。
