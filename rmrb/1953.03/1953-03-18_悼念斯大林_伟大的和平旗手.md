Xinhua News Agency dispatch: People all over the world mourn the death of Comrade J.V. Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world, with infinite grief and steadfast resolve.

    **The Entire People of Vietnam Deeply Mourn Stalin**

The entire people of Vietnam deeply mourn the death of Marshal Stalin, the great leader of the working people of the world, the beloved teacher and best friend of the Vietnamese people. All government organs, factories, schools, and troops throughout Vietnam flew their flags at half-mast in mourning. Members of the Lao Dong Party, workers, soldiers, and cadres all wore black armbands. Memorial services were held throughout the country.

The Central Committee of the Vietnam Lao Dong Party, the Government of Vietnam, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, and the National Committee of the Vietnam Lien Viet Front held a memorial service on March 10. President Ho Chi Minh spoke at the meeting, explaining Stalin's great contributions to the revolutionary cause. He particularly emphasized that the Vietnamese people must, from now on, unite more closely around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the great Soviet people, be vigilant against the conspiracies of imperialism, and resolutely fight for national independence and world peace.

The Vietnam Lao Dong Party's newspaper "People" Weekly, in an editorial entitled "We Infinitely Mourn Comrade Stalin," said: Comrade Stalin not only fought for the happiness of the Soviet people and the future of the world's working class, but also for the liberation cause of the oppressed people. He led the world's working class and progressive people to defend peace. The editorial said: The death of Comrade Stalin is a huge and painful loss for humanity.

Hoang Quoc Viet, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Vietnam Lien Viet Front, wrote in an article entitled "The Vietnamese People Mourn and Thank Marshal Stalin": The Vietnamese people, like the people of the world, thank Comrade Stalin, who, together with Lenin, led the victorious October Revolution, which ushered in a new era. The Vietnamese revolutionary movement, led by President Ho Chi Minh and the former Indochinese Communist Party, and now the Vietnam Lao Dong Party, for twenty years, originated from the October Revolution. While mourning and thanking Comrade Stalin, the Vietnamese people and cadres are determined to intensify the study of the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and apply them to the actual environment of Vietnam, to advance the war of resistance, eliminate the French colonialists, American interventionists, and Vietnamese traitors, and build Vietnam into a new democratic country, advancing towards socialism.

    **Grotewohl Writes an Article Mourning Stalin**

The "Pravda" published an article by Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, entitled: "Stalin and the German People."

Grotewohl pointed out: Comrade Stalin had given the German people many invaluable assistance.

Grotewohl said: As early as 1918, Stalin exposed the true nature of the Treaty of Versailles as an instrument of plunder. In 1934, Stalin called on the people of all countries, including the German people, to fight against the Hitler regime. On February 23, 1942, while the war was still going on, Stalin, in his speech, distinguished the German people from the Nazi clique.

Grotewohl continued: The Soviet Red Army liberated the German people from fascist rule, thus ensuring that Germany obtained the foundation to become a democratic and peace-loving country. In the years that followed, the Soviet Union's international policy of peace and friendship provided the necessary conditions for the peaceful development of Germany, and this policy was based on the Potsdam Agreement, which was full of Stalin's concern for the future of the German people.

The Soviet Union has consistently and clearly pursued, and is still pursuing, the Stalinist policy of peace aimed at realizing the Potsdam Agreement in all international conferences.

Grotewohl pointed out: Thanks to Comrade Stalin's assistance, the German Democratic Republic victoriously broke the political and diplomatic isolation into which the Nazi policy had plunged Germany, and gained the trust of peace-loving people. The Soviet Union provided great assistance in the German people's development of their peaceful economy.

The great Stalin pointed out to the German people the clear path to complete unification and conclude a peace treaty.

Grotewohl said: Without Comrade Stalin's wise policy towards Germany, there would be no German Democratic Republic. The German Democratic Republic is the center for the German people to strive smoothly for national unification, the conclusion of a peace treaty, and opposition to warmongers.

Without Comrade Stalin's wise policy towards Germany, German patriots would not have received the encouragement to successfully organize the nation against the policy of the Bonn traitors.

Grotewohl concluded: The death of the great Stalin, who dedicated his life to the cause of communism, is also an irreparable loss for the German people. The German people and their vanguard—the Socialist Unity Party of Germany—will always remember the great Stalin. They will spare no effort to fulfill his legacy. They will educate the German people in the spirit of irreconcilable and resolute struggle against enemies at home and abroad, and fight for the unification of their country, for the conclusion of a peace treaty, and for world peace, democracy, and socialism.

    **Chervenkov Writes an Article Mourning Comrade Stalin**

Volko Chervenkov, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, wrote in "Pravda": Our era will be forever recorded as the era of Stalin, the brightest era in the history of mankind. The course of world history is developing according to the predictions of Lenin and Stalin. Now, together with the Soviet Union, the first and main "shock brigade" of the world revolution and the workers' movement, new "shock brigades," the people's democracies, from China and Korea to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, are growing stronger and stronger. The irresistible movement of the people of all countries for freedom and peace, for democracy and socialism, is also growing under the banner of the victorious ideas of Lenin and Stalin. The ideas of Marxism-Leninism, the ideas of Lenin and Stalin, have taken deep root in the hearts of the masses. The influence and prestige of the Communist and Workers' Parties in all parts of the world are growing day by day.

Chervenkov continued: The Bulgarian people have realized from their own experience that only Communists armed with the revolutionary theory of Lenin and Stalin can ensure the rapid development of productive forces and the flourishing of national culture. It is only because of the friendship with the Soviet Union, which leads the great camp of peace and democracy, that Bulgaria can become a free, independent, vibrant, prosperous, and strong country. Our people must strengthen even more vigorously the sacred friendship with the peoples of the Soviet Union, which is as important to us as air and the sun are to every living thing. We must further strengthen the unity of the whole nation in the Fatherland Front, and move steadily forward along the path pointed out by the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, along the path illuminated by the genius of Comrade Stalin, and will continue to move forward.

Chervenkov concluded: The great Communist Party of the Soviet Union is strong and great. Stalin is immortal, just as Marx and Engels are immortal, just as Lenin is immortal. The people's democracies, closely united with the Soviet Union, relying on the assistance of the Soviet Union, and applying the experience of the Soviet Union, will advance along the path pointed out by Lenin and Stalin towards the complete victory of socialism. The camp of free people, united by unbreakable Stalinist friendship, will become even stronger.

    **Duclos Writes an Article Mourning Comrade Stalin**

"Pravda" published an article by Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the French Communist Party, on the 15th, entitled: "Stalin - The Great Banner Bearer of Peace."

Duclos wrote: The people of all countries in the world, including many men and women who do not believe in communism, mourn the death of Stalin. They recognize that this genius of mankind was a great banner bearer of peace.

Comrade Stalin had made every effort to prevent the outbreak of the Second World War. When fascist Germany attacked the Soviet Union, Comrade Stalin led all the people to resist fascism and liberated the people of Europe and Asia from fascist oppression. After the end of the war, Comrade Stalin continued to defend the cause of peace, which was once again threatened by imperialists.

Long before the signing of the Atlantic Pact, Stalin advocated the conclusion of a peace pact. But the American imperialists preferred to conclude a war pact.

In October 1951, Comrade Stalin gave an interview to a "Pravda" reporter, advocating the prohibition and cessation of the manufacture of atomic weapons, and the establishment of an international control organization to implement these decisions.

When the American aggressors began to wage war against the peace-loving Korean people, the Soviet Union, under the leadership of Stalin, demanded an immediate cessation of hostilities and a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Later, the Soviet government and Comrade Stalin himself repeatedly took various steps aimed at ending the Korean War.

In order to maintain peace in Europe, Comrade Stalin opposed the division of Germany by Western countries and advocated the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. The Soviet Union repeatedly put forward concrete proposals, advocating a peaceful solution to the German question.

The governments of Western countries opposed the Soviet proposals because they attempted to turn West Germany into a springboard for launching aggression against the Soviet Union and democratic countries. However, the people of Western European countries, including the people of West Germany, enthusiastically supported the Soviet proposals.

Duclos talked about two opposing policy lines: one is the imperialist line of conquering the people of other countries; the other is the Stalinist line, the communist line that people should decide their own destiny. He wrote: The imperialists are afraid of peaceful competition between the socialist and capitalist systems. Therefore, they are becoming increasingly hostile to peace. The imperialists know that the people of those countries will never allow others to undermine their political and social achievements. Therefore, they are increasingly placing their hopes on spies and saboteurs.

Duclos concluded: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government have, are, and will continue to implement Stalin's policy of peace. Millions of French men and women solemnly swear: the French people will never fight against the Soviet people.

Stalin, the great banner bearer of peace, will forever live in the hearts of hundreds of millions of men and women around the world, who are fully determined to force the warmongers to retreat.

    **Sti and Johnson Write Articles Mourning Stalin**

"Pravda" published articles mourning Stalin by Andre Sti, a Stalin Prize winner and French writer, and Johnson, Dean of Canterbury, a Stalin International Peace Prize winner.

Sti said: Every honest French man and woman will never forget: Stalin was a reliable peace fighter, a fighter for the freedom and independence of all peoples. The name of Stalin fills the French working people with confidence in the future victory of socialism and communism. In bidding farewell to Stalin, we swear: under the leadership of Comrade Thorez, Stalin's faithful student, we must, on all occasions, learn from Stalin's example, dedicate our lives, our last drop of blood, to the great cause of socialism and communism, the eternally immortal cause of Lenin and Stalin.

Johnson wrote: Stalin, together with Marx, Engels, and Lenin, was the creator of the new world. Stalin's life has inspired hundreds of millions of people. He and Lenin saw the goal ahead - the liberation of all people. Stalin worked firmly and flexibly towards this goal.

    **Robeson Writes an Article Mourning Stalin**

"Pravda" published an article mourning J.V. Stalin sent by Paul Robeson from the United States.

Robeson described in detail the great role Stalin played in bringing a happy life to all the minorities living in the Soviet Union. He wrote: In the Soviet Union, the Yakut, Nenets, Kyrgyz and other ethnic groups are advancing at an incredible rate in this socialist country. Here, there are no empty promises, as colored people in America often hear, but only actions, such as turning the Uzbek desert into abundant cotton fields.

Robeson continued: Currently, in the Far East, Southeast Asia, Latin America, the West Indies, the Near East, and Africa, hundreds of millions of people oppressed by colonialism are rising up to fight for freedom. They are watching the Soviet Socialist Republics. They see that under the leadership of the great Stalin, millions of people, like themselves, have created a new life. They see that under the leadership of Mao Zedong, the new China, taking the Soviet Union as an example, is concentrating their powerful forces to build a new life. They see that some European countries, which were considered semi-colonies in the past, are successfully building people's democratic systems. There, the people decide their own destiny, and their progress is due to the great theoretical and practical leadership of their friend Stalin.

Robeson concluded by writing about Stalin's influence on all aspects of life. He said: From Stalin's earliest writings to his last conversations, his contribution to modern science is immeasurable. Stalin, because of his sincere humanism and his wisdom, left us the most precious legacy. Most importantly, he determined the nature and direction of our current and future struggles. He pointed out the path towards peace, peaceful coexistence and cooperation between countries and peoples, scientific and cultural exchange, and no war and destruction.

Stalin has left us, and hundreds of millions of people in countries around the world are mourning him in deep grief. But the struggle continues and will continue, and he knew this.

    悼念斯大林——伟大的和平旗手
    据新华社讯：世界各国人民以无限悲痛和坚定的心情悼念全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师约·维·斯大林的逝世。
      越南全国人民沉痛哀悼斯大林
    越南全国人民沉痛哀悼全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖、越南人民的亲爱导师和最好的朋友斯大林大元帅的逝世。越南全国政府机关、工厂、学校、部队都下半旗志哀。劳动党党员、工人、战士、干部的臂上都带上了黑纱。追悼会在全国各地举行。
    越南劳动党中央委员会、越南人民政府、越南国民大会常务委员会和越南国民联合战线全国委员会在三月十日举行了追悼会。胡志明主席在会上讲话。说明斯大林对革命事业所作的巨大贡献。他特别强调越南人民今后要更加紧密地团结在苏联共产党和伟大的苏联人民周围，警惕帝国主义的阴谋，为民族独立和世界和平而坚决斗争。
    越南劳动党机关报“人民”周刊在题为“我们无限地哀悼斯大林同志”的社论中说：斯大林同志不仅为苏联人民的幸福和世界工人阶级的未来而奋斗，同时也为被压迫人民的解放事业而奋斗。他领导全世界工人阶级和进步人民保卫和平。社论说：斯大林同志的逝世是人类的巨大和沉痛的损失。
    越南国民联合战线全国委员会副主席黄国越在题为“越南人民哀悼和感谢斯大林大元帅”的文章中写道：越南人民和世界人民一样感谢斯大林同志，他和列宁一起领导胜利的十月革命，这个革命开创了一个新的纪元。二十年来由胡志明主席和以前的东洋共产党以及现在的越南劳动党所领导的越南革命运动，正是起源于十月革命的。越南人民和干部在哀悼和感谢斯大林同志的时候，决心依照胡志明主席的指示，加紧学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说，并运用到越南的实际环境中去，推进抗战，肃清法国殖民者、美国干涉者和越南卖国贼，把越南建成一个新民主的国家，向社会主义前进。
      格罗提渥撰文悼念斯大林
      “真理报”刊载德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥的文章，题目是：“斯大林和德国人民”。
    格罗提渥指出：斯大林同志曾经给予德国人民许多次不可估价的援助。
    格罗提渥说：斯大林早在一九一八年就揭露凡尔赛条约的真正性质是一种掠夺的工具。斯大林在一九三四年曾号召包括德国人民在内的全世界各国人民进行反对希特勒政权的斗争。一九四二年二月二十三日，当时还正在战争期间，斯大林在他的演说里就把德国人民和纳粹集团分别看待。
    格罗提渥继续写道：苏联红军把德国人民从法西斯统治下解放出来，因此保证德国获得了成为一个民主与爱好和平的国家的基础。在后来的年代中，苏联的国际和平友好政策为德国的和平发展提供了必要的条件，这种政策的基础就是波茨坦协定，这个协定中充满了斯大林对德国人民前途的关怀。
    苏联在所有的国际会议上一直坚持不懈地和明确地奉行着而且现在还在奉行着目的在于实现波茨坦协定的斯大林和平政策。
    格罗提渥指出：由于斯大林同志的援助，德意志民主共和国胜利地打破了纳粹政策使德国陷入的政治外交上的孤立状态，并且取得了爱好和平人民的信任。苏联在德国人民发展他们的和平经济中提供了极大的帮助。
    伟大的斯大林给德国人民指出了完成统一和缔结和约的明确道路。
    格罗提渥说：如果没有斯大林同志的英明的对德政策，便不会有德意志民主共和国。德意志民主共和国是德国人民顺利地为争取国家统一、缔结和约、反对战争贩子而奋斗的中心。
    如果没有斯大林同志的英明的对德政策，德国的爱国人士就得不到使他们胜利地组织全国反对波恩叛徒们的政策的鼓舞。
    格罗提渥最后写道：毕生献身共产主义事业的伟大的斯大林的逝世，也是德国人民不可弥补的损失。德国人民和他们的先锋队——德国统一社会党——将永远怀念伟大的斯大林。他们将鞠躬尽瘁地完成他的遗训。他们将用与国内外敌人进行不可调和的、坚决的斗争的精神教育德国人民，为争取他们国家的统一、争取缔结和约、争取世界和平、民主与社会主义而进行斗争。
      契尔文科夫著文悼念斯大林同志
    保加利亚共产党中央委员会总书记伏尔科·契尔文科夫在“真理报”上撰文说：我们这个时代将作为斯大林的时代、作为人类有史以来最光明的时代永垂史册。世界历史的进程是按着列宁和斯大林的预见发展的。现在，跟苏联这个世界革命和工人阶级运动第一个和主要的“突击队”在一起，新的“突击队”，人民民主国家，从中国和朝鲜直到捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利，日益发展强大。不可抗拒的各国人民争取自由与和平、争取民主与社会主义的运动，也在胜利的列宁和斯大林思想的旗帜下增长着。马克思列宁主义的思想，列宁和斯大林的思想已经在群众的心中根深蒂固。各国共产党和工人党的影响和威信在世界各地日益增长。
    契尔文科夫继续说：保加利亚人民已经从自身的经验中认识到：只有用列宁和斯大林的革命理论武装起来的共产党人，能够确保生产力的迅速发展，能够确保民族文化的繁荣茂盛。只是由于对那领导着伟大的和平民主阵营的苏联的友好，保加利亚才能够成为一个自由独立的、活力充沛的、繁荣强盛的国家。我国人民要更加有力地加强与苏联各族人民的神圣友谊，这种友谊对于我们就像空气和太阳对于每一种生物一样地重要。我们要进一步加强全国在祖国阵线中的团结，沿着伟大的苏联共产党所指出的道路，沿着斯大林同志的天才所照明的道路，稳步地前进，并且必将继续前进。
    契尔文科夫最后写道：伟大的苏联共产党是强盛而伟大的。斯大林是不朽的，正如马克思和恩格斯是不朽的、正如列宁是不朽的一样。各人民民主国家，与苏联亲密团结，凭借苏联的援助，运用苏联的经验，将沿着列宁和斯大林所指出的道路向着社会主义的完全胜利前进。用牢不可破的斯大林友谊结合起来的自由人民团结一致的阵营必将更加强盛起来。
      杜克洛撰文悼念斯大林同志
    “真理报”在十五日刊登了法国共产党书记雅克·杜克洛的文章，题目是：“斯大林——伟大的和平旗手”。
    杜克洛写道：全世界一切国家的人民，包括许多并不信仰共产主义的男女，都痛悼斯大林的逝世。他们认识到这位人类的天才是伟大的和平旗手。
    斯大林同志曾经竭力阻止第二次世界大战爆发。当法西斯德国进攻苏联时，斯大林同志率领全体人民抵抗法西斯主义，并且使欧、亚两洲人民从法西斯压迫下解放出来。大战结束以后，斯大林同志继续保卫再度遭受帝国主义者威胁的和平事业。
    远在大西洋公约缔结以前，斯大林就主张缔结和平公约。但是美帝国主义者宁愿缔结一个战争公约。
    一九五一年十月，斯大林同志对“真理报”记者发表谈话，主张禁用和停止制造原子武器，并且建立国际管制机构来执行这些决定。
    当美国侵略者们开始对爱好和平的朝鲜人民发动战争的时候，在斯大林领导下的苏联就要求立即停止敌对行动，和平解决朝鲜问题。以后，苏联政府和斯大林同志本人又屡次采取了目的在于结束朝鲜战争的种种步骤。
    为了维护欧洲的和平，斯大林同志反对西方国家瓜分德国，主张建立一个统一、民主、爱好和平的德国。苏联再三提出具体建议，主张和平解决德国问题。
    西方各国政府反对苏联的建议，因为它们企图把西德变成向苏联和各民主国家发动侵略的跳板。但是，西欧各国人民，包括西德人民在内，都热烈支持苏联的建议。
    杜克洛谈到两条对立的政策路线：一条是要征服别国人民的帝国主义路线；另一条是斯大林路线，要人民自行决定其命运的共产主义路线。他写道：帝国主义者害怕社会主义和资本主义制度之间的和平竞赛。因此，他们愈来愈敌视和平。帝国主义者知道那些国家的人民绝不肯让别人来破坏他们在政治上和社会上的成就。因此，他们愈来愈把希望寄托在间谍和破坏分子的身上。
    杜克洛最后指出：苏联共产党和苏联政府过去，现在和将来都实行斯大林的和平政策。千百万法国男女庄严地宣誓：法国人民永远不对苏联人民作战。
    和平的伟大旗手斯大林永远活在全世界亿万男女的心中，他们有充分决心来迫使战争贩子们后退。
      斯梯、约翰逊撰文悼念斯大林
      “真理报”刊登了斯大林奖金得奖人、法国作家安德烈·斯梯和斯大林国际和平奖金得奖人、英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊悼念斯大林的文章。
    斯梯说：每一个诚实的法国男女永远不会忘记：斯大林是可靠的和平战士，是为各族人民的自由与独立而斗争的战士。斯大林的名字使法国劳动人民对于社会主义与共产主义的未来胜利充满了信心。在向斯大林告别的时候，我们宣誓：我们在斯大林的忠实学生多列士的领导下，无论在什么场合，都一定要学习斯大林的榜样，把我们的生命，把我们的最后一滴血，献给社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业，列宁和斯大林的永远不朽的事业。
    约翰逊写道：斯大林和马克思、恩格斯、列宁是新世界的创造者。斯大林的一生鼓舞了亿万人民。他和列宁一同看到前面的目标——一切人民的解放。斯大林坚强而灵活地为这个目标而努力。
      罗伯逊著文悼念斯大林
    “真理报”刊载了保罗·罗伯逊从美国寄来的一篇悼念约·维·斯大林的文章。
    罗伯逊详细叙述了斯大林在为居住在苏联的所有少数民族带来幸福生活方面所起的伟大作用。他写道：在苏联，雅库特、涅涅茨、吉尔吉斯和其它民族在这个社会主义的国家里，以令人难以相信的速度前进。在这里，没有像有色人在美国经常听到的空洞的诺言，而只有像使乌兹别克的沙漠变为丰盛棉田这样的行动。
    罗伯逊继续说：目前，在远东、东南亚、拉丁美洲、西印度群岛、近东和非洲，千百万受殖民主义者压迫的人民正在起来为自由而斗争。他们注视着各苏维埃社会主义共和国。他们看到在伟大的斯大林的领导下，数百万和他们自己一样的人民已经创造了新的生活，他们看到新中国在毛泽东的领导下，以苏联为榜样，正在集中他们的强大力量建立一个新的生活。他们看到一些在过去被认为是半殖民地的欧洲国家正在成功地建设人民民主制度。在那里，人民自己来决定他们的命运，他们的进步要归功于他们的朋友斯大林伟大的理论的和实际的领导。
    罗伯逊最后写到斯大林对于生活各方面的影响。他说：从斯大林的最初的著作到最后的谈话，它对现代科学的贡献都是不可估量的。斯大林由于他的诚挚的人道主义和他的智慧，留给了我们最宝贵的遗产。最重要的是他决定了我们目前和将来的斗争的性质和方向。他指出了走向和平、各国和各族人民和平共处与合作、科学和文化交流、没有战争和破坏的道路。
    斯大林已经离开了我们，世界各国亿万人民正在沉痛地哀悼他。但是斗争在继续进行，并且还要继续下去，他是知道这一点的。
