Telegram of Condolences from the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia:

	We are deeply saddened to learn of the unfortunate passing of Comrade Gottwald, the respected leader of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Czechoslovak people, and a close friend of the Chinese people. We extend our deepest condolences with the utmost grief. In these sorrowful days following the passing of Comrade Stalin, this new sorrow has been added. We, the entire Communist Party members and the entire people of Jiangsu Province, vow, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, to transform grief into strength, further consolidate and develop the friendly unity between the Chinese and Czech peoples, continue to strengthen the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and strive for the victory of the cause of lasting world peace.
					The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
