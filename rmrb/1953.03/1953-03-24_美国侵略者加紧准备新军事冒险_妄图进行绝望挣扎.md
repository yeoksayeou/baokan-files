    Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: The American aggressors are still attempting to salvage their defeat in the Korean War through desperate struggles. U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson declared on the 20th that he has no plans to end the Korean War. General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command, who is currently engaged in conspiratorial activities in Vietnam, also said on the same day, "From where I sit in Tokyo, there is no indication that we are going to end the war in Korea. Certainly, there is no sign that the Korean War will end soon."
    Prior to this, Van Fleet, a defeated general under the command of the Korean and Chinese people, clamored in the U.S. Congress that the U.S. must salvage its defeat in Korea. He said: "They (referring to the Korean and Chinese people) say we are imperialists, and they have stopped us. They have been damaging our reputation. The fact that we were stopped somewhat indicates that we admit we can't do any better." Van Fleet sadly admitted: "Even our allies are beginning to doubt our strength and prestige." Therefore, he said, "We need a military victory to show that we are superior and that the Communists are nothing."
    In order to salvage their "prestige," the American aggressors are actively preparing for new military adventures. The "U.S. News & World Report" magazine reported on March 13th that "Eisenhower's plan for the Korean War is rapidly unfolding." One element of this plan is to withdraw American troops from the front lines in order to "form a considerable reserve force behind the Korean front," ready to be used for "raids" at any time. The magazine said: "This reserve force already has two American divisions, and in the future, it may be augmented by three or four divisions." According to a report in the London "Times," the British accomplice troops invading Korea had already withdrawn from the front lines in early February and are undergoing "more intensive" training "than ever before" "for any task they may be assigned."
    However, even the reactionary American military commentator Baldwin has recognized that this kind of struggle is futile. Baldwin wrote in the March 15th "New York Times" that the only way for the United States to increase "pressure" in Korea is through ground attacks. Baldwin believes that this plan has many disadvantages, such as requiring more troops, more munitions, and more equipment than are currently in Korea. Even if troops and munitions could be obtained and an adventure launched, "American and Allied casualties would increase significantly," and amphibious landings could completely fail. If the current stalemate is maintained, then the United States will still consume a large amount of materials and personnel. Baldwin concluded: "The difficulty of resolving the Korean situation remains the same as in the past. None of the paths we can take are without danger, and none of them can guarantee our success."

### 美国侵略者加紧准备新军事冒险  妄图进行绝望挣扎

    美国侵略者加紧准备新军事冒险
    妄图进行绝望挣扎
    【新华社二十三日讯】美国侵略者仍然企图用绝望的挣扎来挽回侵略朝鲜的败局。美国国防部长威尔逊二十日宣称，他没有结束朝鲜战争的计划。正在越南进行阴谋活动的美军远东总司令克拉克也在同一天说，“从东京我所坐的地方看来，并没有迹象表示我们将要结束朝鲜的战争。肯定地说，朝鲜战争并没有早日结束的迹象。”
    在此以前，朝中人民手下的败将范佛里特曾经在美国国会中叫嚷必须挽回美国在朝鲜的败局。他说：“他们（指朝中人民）说我们是帝国主义者，他们制止了我们。他们一直在损害我们的声誉。我们被制止这个事实，多少是表示我们承认我们不能再做得好一些。”范佛里特悲哀地承认：“即使是我们的盟国，也开始在怀疑我们的力量与威望。”因此，他说，“我们需要一个军事胜利来表示我们是超乎一切的，共产党是算不了什么的。”
    为了挽回自己的“威望”，美国侵略者正在积极准备新的军事冒险。“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志在三月十三日报道说，“艾森豪威尔对于朝鲜战争的计划正在迅速展开。”这个计划的内容之一，就是将美国军队从前线上撤下来，以便“在朝鲜战线之后组成一支可观的后备力量”，随时可以用来“突袭”。这个杂志说：“这一后备力量早已拥有二师美国军队，将来还可以加上三师或四师。”另据伦敦“泰晤士报”报道，侵略朝鲜的英国帮凶军在二月初就已经从前线上撤下来，并且正在“为着可能被指派担任的任何工作”而进行着“比以前任何时候更为紧张”的训练。
    但是，就是美国的反动的军事评论家鲍尔温也已经认识到：这种挣扎是没有用处的。鲍尔温在三月十五日的“纽约时报”上写道：美国要想在朝鲜增加“压力”，只能用一种方式——就是地面攻击。鲍尔温认为，这种计划有许多不利之处，例如需要比目前在朝鲜的更多的军队，更多的军火与配备。即便能够得到军队和军火而发动冒险，“美国和联军的伤亡将大量增加”，而两栖登陆也可能完全失败。如果保持目前的僵局，那末美国的物资和人员还要大量消耗。鲍尔温最后说：“朝鲜战局之难于解决，仍旧跟过去一样。我们所能走的路，没有一条是不带有危险的，也没有一条路能保证我们一定成功。”
