    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began discussing the report of the United Nations Disarmament Commission on the morning of March 18. The report was included in agenda of the General Assembly under the title of "Regulation, limitation and balanced reduction of all armed forces and all armaments." The discussion of this report continued on the 19th and 20th of March.

    As everyone knows, the United Nations Disarmament Commission, which began its work in 1952, did not complete its main task or make any decisions due to the opposition of the United States, Britain, France, and certain other countries. The United States and its satellite states led the commission's activities in the wrong direction of "reporting and reviewing" armaments. As a result, the issue of disarmament and the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons has not been resolved.

    At the meeting on the 19th, the first speaker was US representative Gross, who tried in vain to shift the responsibility for the commission's lack of success onto the Soviet Union. He used every means to try to pass off the proposals for "reporting and reviewing" armaments—primarily conventional armaments—and determining the "maximum limits" of armed forces as a solution to the "disarmament problem" and a way to "abolish" atomic weapons. The US representative's statement was obviously untenable, because the US proposal neither stipulated the prohibition of atomic weapons nor the reduction of armaments and armed forces. In conclusion, the US representative supported the joint proposal put forward by the representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and some other countries, which stipulated that the United Nations Disarmament Commission should continue its work and submit a report on the results of its work to the General Assembly and the Security Council by September 1, 1953.

    At the meeting on the 19th, the representatives of Britain, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Greece spoke and admitted that the United Nations Disarmament Commission had not completed the task it was entrusted with. However, like the US representative, they tried to make it seem as if it was not the United States, Britain, and France that hindered the smooth progress of the commission's work, but the Soviet Union.

    Soviet representative Zorin spoke next, detailing the Soviet delegation's position on the issue. In his speech, Zorin first refuted the speech made by US representative Gross in the Political Committee on March 18, because Gross insisted that the US government was in favor of disarmament and that the Soviet government's position was an obstacle to disarmament. The Soviet representative emphasized that at previous sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet Union had tirelessly put forward the following proposals: disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the establishment of a strict international control agency to supervise the implementation of this prohibition. These proposals were the best guarantee of peace and the security of all countries. Defending peace and opposing the preparation and launching of new wars have been, are, and will be the main concerns of the Soviet government. Zorin drew the committee's attention to the speech made by Soviet Minister of Council Chairman Malenkov on March 9 this year: "In foreign policy, our main concern is to prevent a new war and to live in peace with all countries." On March 15 this year, Malenkov said at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: "Countries concerned with maintaining peace can now and in the future believe in the Soviet Union's lasting peace policy." Zorin continued that these remarks by the Soviet government leaders expressed the Soviet people's desire to maintain peace and prevent war. People all over the world have this desire. The American people are naturally no exception. As for the US government's policy, it can be seen from Gross's speech that, as before, what determines US policy now is still the arms race and the establishment of a so-called "position of strength." This policy is incompatible with the task of disarmament and is obviously contradictory to Gross's statement that disarmament is the best guarantee against aggression. The Soviet representative responded to Gross's question—whether the Soviet Union would engage in "constructive" cooperation in disarmament—he said that the United States raised this question out of thin air, because everyone knows very well that the Soviet government has put forward specific proposals to ban atomic weapons year after year, but it has always been opposed by the United States first.

    Zorin said that, despite this, the Soviet Union will continue to seek the realization of the important task of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the various agencies of the United Nations, including the Disarmament Commission, despite US opposition. In analyzing the work of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, Zorin said that the United States, Britain, and France, especially the United States, should bear the main responsibility for obstructing the progress of the work.

    The Soviet representative put forward a proposal suggesting that the commission immediately consider practical measures to solve the disarmament issue—first, pay attention to the reduction of armaments of the five major powers of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and China, solve the issue of unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and the issue of establishing strict international control to supervise the implementation of these decisions.

    At the meeting on the morning of March 20, Polish representative Birecki pointed out in a detailed analysis of the US proposal on "reporting and reviewing" arms information that the US proposal could not help solve the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and that the refusal attitude taken by the United States and its supporters towards these issues inevitably brought the work of the United Nations Disarmament Commission to a standstill. The Polish representative also condemned the United States for refusing to ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of bacteriological warfare. Birecki stated that the Polish delegation fully supported the Soviet proposal.

    At the meeting on the afternoon of the 20th, the representatives of Czechoslovakia, the Ukrainian Republic, and the Byelorussian Republic strongly supported the Soviet proposal. They pointed out that all delegations concerned with maintaining peace and security of all countries must support the practical measures for disarmament, unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction stipulated in the Soviet proposal. Only in this way can the Political Committee fulfill its responsibility and meet the wishes of the people all over the world for peace and security.

    Representatives of Syria, Mexico, and Chile urged the major powers to cooperate, pointing out that without agreement among the major powers, it would be impossible to solve the disarmament issue.

    Syrian representative Tarazi said that the Soviet proposal on the prohibition of atomic weapons should receive the utmost attention. Atomic weapons should be declared illegal in the same way that the 1925 Geneva Protocol declared the use of bacteriological weapons and poison gas illegal. He also said that the expansion of armaments must be stopped, because increasing war production will inevitably reduce civilian production, resulting in the impoverishment of the people.

    联大政委会讨论“联合国裁减军备委员会”的报告
    苏联代表佐林重申苏联政府维护和平政策
    并谴责美国政府一贯阻挠裁减军备和禁止原子武器的阴谋
    据新华社讯：联合国大会政治委员会三月十八日上午会议开始讨论联合国裁减军备委员会的报告，这个报告是以“规定、限制和均衡地裁减一切武装部队和一切军备”的名称列入大会议程的。十九日、二十日继续讨论这个报告。
    大家知道，一九五二年开始工作的联合国裁减军备委员会，由于美、英、法及某些其他国家的反对并没有完成它的主要任务，也没有做出一项决定。美国及其仆从国家把委员会的活动引向“报告与审查”军备的错误方向。结果，关于裁减军备与无条件禁止原子武器的问题并没有得到解决。
    在十九日的会上第一个发言的是美国代表葛罗斯，他枉费心机地企图把委员会毫无成就的责任推到苏联身上。他用一切办法想把“报告与审查”军备——首先是常规军备——及确定武装部队“最高限额”的建议冒充“裁军问题”的解决办法和“废止”原子武器的办法。美国代表的这种说法显然是不能成立的，因为美国的建议既没有规定禁止原子武器，也没有规定裁减军备和武装部队。美国代表在结语中支持美、英、法和其他一些国家代表所提出的联合提案，这提案规定联合国裁减军备委员会继续它的工作，并须在一九五三年九月一日以前向大会和安全理事会提出关于它的工作结果的报告。
    在十九日的会议上，英国、荷兰、新西兰和希腊的代表发言承认联合国裁减军备委员会没有完成它所担负的任务。然而，和美国代表一样，他们竭力把事情说成好像妨碍委员会顺利进行工作的不是美国、英国、法国，而是苏联。
    苏联代表佐林继起发言，他详细叙述了苏联代表团对这个问题的立场。佐林在发言中首先驳斥了美国代表葛罗斯三月十八日在政治委员会的发言，因为葛罗斯硬说美国政府是主张裁减军备的，硬说苏联政府的立场是裁减军备道路上的障碍。苏联代表强调指出：在历届联合国大会上，苏联不倦地提出了下列主张：裁减军备和禁止原子武器并建立严格的国际管制机构以监督这种禁令的执行，而这些主张正是和平与各国安全的最好保证。保卫和平，反对准备和发动新战争，过去、现在和将来都是苏联政府主要关怀的事。佐林提请委员会注意苏联部长会议主席马林科夫今年三月九日的讲话：“在外交政策方面，我们主要关心的是防止新战争，和一切国家和平相处。”今年三月十五日，马林科夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上说：“关心维护和平的国家现在以及将来都可以相信苏联的持久和平政策。”佐林继续说，苏联政府领袖的这些言论表达了苏联人民维护和平与防止战争的愿望。世界各国人民都有这种愿望。美国人民自然也不是例外。至于美国政府的政策，那么从葛罗斯的发言中可以看出，像从前一样，现在决定美国政策的仍然是军备竞赛和建立所谓“实力局面”。这种政策是和裁减军备的任务不相容的，而且显然是和葛罗斯所说的裁减军备是防止侵略的最好保证这种言论自相矛盾的。苏联代表回答葛罗斯提出的问题——苏联是否将在裁减军备方面进行“建设性的”合作，他说美国提出这个问题是凭空臆造的，因为大家知道得很清楚，苏联政府年复一年地提出禁止原子武器的具体提案，但总是首先遭到美国方面的反对。
    佐林说，尽管如此，苏联今后仍将在联合国的各个机构中，包括裁减军备委员会在内，不顾美国的反对，设法求得裁减军备和禁止原子武器以及其他大规模杀人武器这一重要任务的实现。佐林在分析联合国裁减军备委员会的工作时说，美、英、法三国，首先是美国，应对阻挠工作进展负主要责任。
    苏联代表提出提案，建议委员会立刻审议实际措施，以便解决裁减军备问题——首先注意到美国、苏联、英国、法国和中国五大国军备的裁减，解决关于无条件禁止原子武器、细菌武器以及其他大规模杀人武器的问题，关于建立严格的国际管制以监督这些决定的执行问题。
    在三月二十日上午的会议上，波兰代表比雷茨基在详细分析美国关于“报告与审查”军备情报的建议时指出：美国的建议不能帮助解决裁减军备与禁用原子武器的问题，美国及其支持者对于这些问题所采取的拒绝态度，就使联合国裁减军备委员会的工作不能不陷于停顿。波兰代表并谴责美国拒绝批准关于禁止细菌战的一九二五年日内瓦议定书。比雷茨基表示，波兰代表团完全支持苏联的提案。
    在二十日下午的会议上，捷克斯洛伐克代表、乌克兰共和国代表和白俄罗斯共和国代表都极力支持苏联提案。他们指出：一切关心维护各国和平与安全的代表团，都必须支持苏联提案中所规定的裁减军备、无条件禁止原子武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的实际措施。只有这样，政治委员会才能完成它的责任，满足全世界人民要求和平和安全的愿望。
    叙利亚、墨西哥和智利的代表敦促各大国合作，指出各大国间意见不一致，就不可能解决裁减军备问题。
    叙利亚代表塔拉齐说，苏联关于禁止原子武器的建议应该得到最大的注意。应当像一九二五年日内瓦议定书宣布使用细菌武器和毒气为非法一样，宣布原子武器为非法。他又说必须制止扩张军备运动，因为增加战争生产，就必然减少民用生产，结果就使得人民贫困。
