Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 22nd: According to TASS, the People's Chamber and the Senate of the German Democratic Republic held a joint session in Berlin on March 20th.

	The council of the West German "Federation for German Unity, Peace and Freedom Movement" sent a delegation to the meeting. Members of the delegation included former German Reich Chancellor Joseph Wirth, former Munich-Gladbach Mayor Wilhelm Elfes, Bavarian State Parliament member Rossl Hillebrand, and North Rhine-Westphalia textile worker Ilse Kitting.

	Wirth, representing the council of the "Federation for German Unity, Peace and Freedom Movement," said at the meeting that even if the West German Federal Parliament approves the Bonn and Paris war treaties, the "Federation for German Unity, Peace and Freedom Movement" will continue to fight for its goals as it has done up to now.

	At the meeting, the People's Chamber and the Senate adopted a joint declaration calling on the German people to stop the implementation of the Bonn and Paris war treaties. The declaration pointed out that the Bonn Federal Parliament's ratification of the Bonn and Paris war treaties deepens the division of Germany, which is a crime against the peaceful national interests of Germany and seriously damages peace in Europe. The declaration stated that the signing of the Bonn and Paris treaties is incompatible with reaching a peace agreement between the great powers and reaching an agreement between East and West Germany. The declaration also pointed out that the ratification of these treaties violates the decisions in the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements regarding the German people's right to conclude a peace treaty.

	The declaration said: For the German people, the humiliating Bonn and Paris treaties are invalid. The declaration called on all German people to stop the implementation of these war treaties and to fight to overthrow the Adenauer traitorous regime.

	The declaration also reiterated that the People's Chamber and the Senate insist on reaching an all-German agreement on the issue of concluding a peace treaty, so that Germany can become a unified, independent, and democratic country.

    民主德国人民议院、参议院通过联合声明
    宣布波恩和巴黎战争条约无效
    号召德国人民为阻止实现战争条约而斗争
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国人民议院和参议院三月二十日在柏林举行了联席会议。
    西德的“德国争取统一、和平与自由运动联合会”理事会派遣代表团出席了这次会议，代表团团员包括前德意志帝国总理约瑟夫·维尔特、前慕尼黑—格拉德巴赫市长威廉·艾尔费斯、巴伐利亚州议院议员罗斯尔·希勒布兰德和北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州的纺织女工伊尔斯·启汀。
    维尔特代表“德国争取统一、和平与自由运动联合会”理事会在会上说：即使西德联邦议院批准了波恩与巴黎战争条约，“德国争取统一、和平与自由运动联合会”仍将像到现在为止这样地为达到它的目的而斗争。
    会上，人民议院与参议院通过了一项联合声明，号召德国人民阻止实现波恩和巴黎战争条约。声明指出，波恩联邦议院批准波恩与巴黎战争条约加深了德国的分裂，这是对于德国和平的民族利益的一个罪行，而且严重地损害了欧洲和平。声明说，签订波恩和巴黎条约与大国之间取得和平协议及东德与西德之间达成协议是不相容的。声明并指出，批准这些条约违犯了雅尔塔及波茨坦协定中关于德国人民有缔结和约的权利的决定。
    声明说：对于德国人民来说，丧权辱国的波恩和巴黎条约是无效的。声明号召全德人民阻止实现这些战争条约，为推翻阿登纳卖国政权而斗争。
    声明并重申，人民议院和参议院坚持在缔结和约的问题上达成全德协议，以使德国成为一个统一、独立与民主的国家。
