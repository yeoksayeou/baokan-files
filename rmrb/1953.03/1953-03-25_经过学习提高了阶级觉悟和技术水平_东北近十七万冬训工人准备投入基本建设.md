    Having Improved Class Consciousness and Technical Skills Through Study,
    Nearly 170,000 Winter-Trained Workers in Northeast China Prepare to Join Basic Construction
    More than 167,000 workers from basic construction units in Northeast China, having improved their class consciousness and technical skills through winter training, are now actively preparing to devote themselves to the country's large-scale economic construction.
    Last December, under the unified leadership of local Party committees, basic construction units in Northeast China successively began winter training. This work was carried out in two stages. In the first stage, the workers received communist education and studied basic political knowledge. The first stage of political education ended at the end of January this year. The second stage began in early February, focusing on technical education, which is basically scheduled to end by the end of March.
    Through winter training, the workers' class consciousness has significantly improved. Many people have applied to join the Party and the Youth League. Fifty-five people from the First Engineering Company of the Northeast Electrical Industry Bureau have applied to join the Party. Workers from the Third Engineering Company of Shenyang City used to think they were just bricklayers and carpenters, not part of the working class. Now they all say: "Our responsibility is too great. Whether the country is built well depends on how hard we work." Old worker Wang Zhenshan had a lot of experience in binding water tower frames, but he never told anyone. He said: "If I keep a trick up my sleeve, I'll have food wherever I go." Now he actively tells others about his experience in binding frames, and says:
    "If everyone has skills, the country's construction will be faster." In the past, some construction workers had strong hometown sentiments, liked to associate with people from the same hometown, and excluded workers from other regions. They said: "If they're not from the same hometown, they're not on the same wavelength." After winter training, many people with this kind of thinking have made self-criticisms and recognized the principle that "workers of the world are one family." Some construction workers from rural areas were unwilling to live a collective life and often complained: "Going to work, getting off work, eating, and meetings all require queuing up, it's really tough!" Now they all say: "Without organization, there would be chaos." Some workers from the Construction Engineering Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry used to think about going to work in other units, unwilling to stay in Shenyang, fearing that they would be transferred to other regions in the future, but now these workers have made guarantees to the trade union: "No matter where we are transferred, we will resolutely obey the organization's assignments." In the past, some workers demanded excessively high wages and did not understand the unity of national interests and individual interests; now they all universally know:
    "If the country is built well, individual lives will also be better." These changes in thinking show that the class consciousness of construction workers in Northeast China has improved. This is the biggest gain of the winter training work in Northeast China, and this gain will play a huge role in this year's basic construction.
    Another gain of the winter training work in Northeast China is that the workers' technical level has been improved. During the winter training period, basic construction units in Northeast China conducted technical education for workers. In technical education, workers learned various advanced experiences, technical theories, and technical specifications. Some workers also carried out practical operations on advanced experiences. Some bricklayers from the Third Engineering Company of Shenyang City did not know what the double-handed mud squeezing method was in the past, but now they have learned it. Cui Jingbo, a worker from the First Engineering Company of the Northeast Electrical Industry Bureau, created the horizontal bricklaying method after learning the advanced bricklaying method. After technical education, the technical level of workers in many basic construction units can generally be raised by one level. Some apprentices from the First Engineering Company of the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau have reached the technical level of formal workers. According to last year's technical standards, the carpenters of the First Engineering Company of the Northeast Electrical Industry Bureau can all be raised by one level, and 20% of the carpenters can be raised by two levels. In the past, many units lacked specialized workers. After winter training, some units have formed teams of specialized workers. The Construction Engineering Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has trained electrical workers and has initially mastered the technology in this area. Construction units in Harbin, Changchun, and other places have also trained plumbers and pipe fitters. The First Engineering Company of the Northeast Nonferrous Metals Bureau has also held mechanical training classes to prepare for the use of construction machinery. Currently, some workers in some units are preparing to go to the site to practice what they have learned. Some workers have already begun to discuss construction plans and understand blueprints.
    However, there are still many problems in the technical education of basic construction units in Northeast China. The leading cadres of some units have relaxed their leadership over technical education. The leading cadres of the Jiamusi Forestry Industry Bureau have never studied the problems in technical education. The Second Engineering Company of the Northeast Electrical Industry Bureau did not formally conduct technical education until late February. The winter training office of this company does not have a single technical cadre, and the problems in technical teaching cannot be resolved. Many tools have not been purchased, and workers cannot carry out practical operations because they do not have tools. Workers reflect: "Without practical operation, it is useless to know some technical principles." Many construction workers in many units feel: "We have learned a lot of principles, but it is still a question of whether we can use them." They hope to intensify practical operation before the end of technical education. Some units have already attached importance to practical operation, and the workers are very happy. They also requested to perform several demonstrations on the site. They said: "If we practice a few more times now, it will be easier to use new methods when we work in the future."
    Because the workers have improved their technical level in technical education, they hope to conduct a skill assessment. They said: "Our technology has improved, and our grades should also be improved." Some workers are afraid of not being assessed and often ask the trade union: "When will the skill assessment be? What level should I be at?" This request should attract the attention of the leading authorities. Currently, some units have already conducted skill assessments, but the standards of the skill assessment are too high, and many workers cannot meet the standards. Workers from the Third Engineering Company of Shenyang City said: "I don't understand what is being tested; if I understood, I could be a technician." It is estimated that according to the company's standards, only 5% of bricklayers can be first-class workers. Some units use oral examinations to assess skills. Workers are very flustered during oral examinations and often cannot answer. Individual units have also shown egalitarianism during skill assessments. Some workers said: "Our skills are about the same, everyone should be promoted." These biases should be prevented. At present, the leading authorities should quickly stipulate skill assessment standards and determine appropriate skill assessment methods in order to do a good job in skill assessment, consolidate the workers' enthusiasm for learning technology, and constantly stimulate workers to improve their technical level.

### 经过学习提高了阶级觉悟和技术水平  东北近十七万冬训工人准备投入基本建设

    经过学习提高了阶级觉悟和技术水平
    东北近十七万冬训工人准备投入基本建设
    东北各基本建设单位的十六万七千多工人，经过冬训之后，提高了阶级觉悟和技术水平，目前正积极地准备投入祖国大规模的经济建设。
    去年十二月，东北各基本建设单位在各地党委的统一领导下，先后开始了冬训工作。这个工作是分两个阶段进行的。在第一阶段中，工人们受到了共产主义的教育，学习了政治常识。今年一月底结束了第一阶段的政治教育。二月初开始第二阶段，进行技术教育，这一阶段三月底基本上可以结束。
    通过冬训，工人们的阶级觉悟显著提高。许多人要求入党、入团。东北电器工业管理局第一工程公司有五十五人要求入党。沈阳市第三工程公司的工人过去认为自己是瓦匠、木匠，不属于工人阶级。现在他们都说：“我们的责任太重大啦。国家建设得好坏，还要看我们努力得怎样。”老工人王振山过去绑水塔的架子，有许多经验，但从来不告诉别人。他说：“我留一手，走到哪儿都有饭吃。”现在他主动地把绑架子的经验告诉别人，并且说道：
    “大伙都有技术，国家建设就快啦。”过去有些建筑工人有浓厚的家乡观念，喜欢跟同乡人来往，排斥其他地区的工人。他们说：“不是家乡人，就不是一个味。”经过冬训，许多有这种思想的人都作了检讨，认识了“天下工人是一家”的道理。有些来自农村的建筑工人不愿意过集体生活，常常发牢骚：“上班下班，吃饭开会，都要排队，真够呛！”现在都说：“没有组织就乱啦。”重工业部建筑工程公司有些工人过去想到别的单位去工作，不愿意留在沈阳，怕将来会调到关内去，但是现在这些工人却向工会提出保证：“不管调到那儿，坚决服从组织分配。”过去有些工人要求过高的工资，不了解国家利益和个人利益的一致性；现在都普遍地知道：
    “国家建设好了，个人的生活也就好了。”这些思想上的变化，说明东北建筑工人的阶级觉悟已经提高。这是东北冬训工作的最大收获，这个收获将会在今年的基本建设中发生巨大作用。
    东北冬训工作的另一个收获是工人们的技术水平得到了提高。在冬训期间，东北各基本建设单位都对工人进行了技术教育。在技术教育中，工人们学习了各种先进经验、技术理论和技术规范。有些工人并对先进经验进行了实际操作。沈阳市第三工程公司有些瓦工过去不知道双手挤浆法是什么，现在学会了。东北电器工业管理局第一工程公司的工人崔静波学习了先进的砌砖法之后，还创造了水平砌砖法。许多基本建设单位的工人经过技术教育之后，在技术上普遍可以提高一级。东北有色金属管理局第一工程公司的徒工，有些已经达到正式工人的技术水平。东北电器工业管理局第一工程公司的木工，按照去年的技术标准，都可提高一级，其中百分之二十的木工可以提高两级。过去许多单位缺少特种工人，经过冬训，有些单位已经组成了特种工人的队伍。重工业部建筑工程公司已经训练了电气工人，初步掌握了这方面的技术。哈尔滨、长春等地的建筑单位还训练了水暖工、管道工。东北有色金属管理局第一工程公司还举办了机械训练班，为使用施工机械准备了力量。目前有些单位的工人，准备到现场去把所学的东西实习一次。有些工人已经开始讨论施工计划，了解图纸。
    但是东北各基本建设单位在技术教育中，还存在着许多问题。有些单位的领导干部放松了对技术教育的领导。佳木斯森林工业局的领导干部从来没有研究过技术教育中的问题。东北电器工业管理局第二工程公司一直到二月下旬才正式进行技术教育。该公司冬训办公室没有一个技术干部，技术教学中的问题得不到解决。许多工具没有购买，工人因为没有工具不能进行实际操作。工人们反映：“不实际操作，就是知道了一些技术道理也不行。”不少单位的建筑工人感到：“学了很多道理，但能不能用还是个问题。”他们希望在结束技术教育之前，加紧进行实际操作。有些单位已经重视实际操作，工人们很高兴。他们还要求在现场进行几次表演。他们说：“现在多实习几次，将来干起活来，用新方法就容易了。”
    工人们由于在技术教育中提高了技术水平，希望进行一次考工。他们说：“我们技术提高了，我们的等级也应该提高。”有些工人生怕不考工，常常问工会：“什么时候考工呀？我应该算那一级呀？”这种要求应该引起领导机关的注意。目前有些单位已经进行考工，但考工的标准过高，许多工人达不到标准。沈阳市第三工程公司工人说：“考的东西我都不懂；如果懂了，我就能当技术员了。”据估计，按该公司的标准，瓦工只有百分之五能够一等工。有些单位用口试的办法考工。工人在口试时心里很慌，常常答不出来。个别单位在考工时还出现了平均主义的现象。有些工人说：“我们的技术都差不离，要提级大家都提。”这些偏向都应该防止。目前领导机关应该很快地规定考工标准，确定妥善的考工方法，以便做好考工工作，巩固工人学习技术的热情，不断地刺激工人提高技术水平。
