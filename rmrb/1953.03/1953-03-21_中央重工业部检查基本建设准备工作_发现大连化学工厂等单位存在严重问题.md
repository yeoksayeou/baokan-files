    Central Ministry of Heavy Industry Inspects Basic Construction Preparations
    Finds Serious Problems in Units Such as Dalian Chemical Factory
    The Basic Construction Preparation Work Inspection Group of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry has successively gone deep into various construction units to inspect work.
    According to reports from some inspection teams and construction units, preliminary findings indicate that some key construction units have serious problems in their preparation work.
    1. Organizational structure is incomplete, lacking strong leadership. For example, the Yunnan Dongchuan Mining Bureau of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has a large construction task this year, but at the time of the inspection, the bureau's engineering company still did not have a manager. Necessary administrative bodies such as the design office, basic construction office, geological office, engineering technology office, and equipment office had not been established. Those that had been established either had staff but no director, or had a director but no staff. The manager of the Dalian Chemical Factory Engineering Company is concurrently held by the deputy director of the Dalian Chemical Factory, who is unable to work due to illness; only two of the seven work areas have been established. Although the directors of the remaining work areas have been transferred, they have been slow to formally start work, and two of the work area directors are still helping with design, and will not be able to take office until six months later; other sections and units have not been staffed. The Taiyuan Chemical Factory work area has already taken many detours in the basic construction work of the past two years, and still does not attach importance to basic construction work. The engineering company of this unit has only four technical personnel, of which only one is an engineer.
    2. Due to the above reasons, the progress of various preparatory work has been affected, and the project progress has been delayed. Although the Dongchuan Mining Bureau has gathered a considerable design force, there is no leadership, and ideas are not unified, and many problems are constantly debated. For example, a design problem in a certain project of the mining bureau has been debated since November last year, and it was not resolved until the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry gave a clear instruction. The domestic design portion of the mining area project was originally planned to be completed by the end of February, but according to the current situation, it will be difficult to complete by the end of March. Due to the slow design progress, the Dongchuan Mining Bureau only completed 50 percent of the planned civil engineering construction in January. Of the ten installation projects, one has completed the plan, another has completed 20 percent of the plan, and the remaining eight have failed to start on schedule. The Dalian Chemical Factory also failed to grasp the design work. For example, a certain factory building is to be completed this year, but the civil engineering design has not yet started, and even the drilling work for the factory building foundation has not been carried out. The staff of the supply section of the engineering company are sorting out material accounts in addition to supplying materials for the 1952 carry-over projects, and the material preparation work for this year has not yet started. In terms of equipment, there are still a large number of large cast steel and cast iron parts to be cast and processed, and no one has yet undertaken to manufacture them. The preparations for the Taiyuan Chemical Factory work area engineering company have also failed to be carried out well. For example, the work area lacks water and electricity, and the company has not yet proposed any solutions.
    3. The responsibilities of both parties, A and B, are unclear, and they shirk each other's responsibilities, affecting the preparatory work. For example, the chief of the basic construction section of the Dalian Chemical Factory said to the engineering company: "In the future, the responsibility for completing the task lies with the engineering company," while the engineering company said: "Party A has not officially handed over the task to us, and we don't care." Party A of the Taiyuan Chemical Factory work area said to Party B: "I am only responsible for paying the money, you do the work," and Party B believes: "I will do as much as I can." Until the time of the inspection, most of the cadres of the Dalian Chemical Factory Engineering Company still had no idea how to complete this year's tasks, and had not fully and meticulously considered the engineering procedures and project progress. They had not arranged how to manufacture self-made equipment, and had not discussed how to carry out equipment and material supply work. The Taiyuan Chemical Factory work area engineering company, because it adopted the method of contracting labor but not materials, sat and waited for Party A to supply materials; Party A could not start supplying materials because the design was not completed, so the materials had not yet been transported to the construction site.
    The problems in the basic construction preparation work of the above-mentioned units are being improved during the inspection process, and the Dalian Chemical Factory has begun to improve.

### 中央重工业部检查基本建设准备工作  发现大连化学工厂等单位存在严重问题

    中央重工业部检查基本建设准备工作
    发现大连化学工厂等单位存在严重问题
    中央重工业部基本建设准备工作检查组，已先后深入各建设单位检查工作。
    根据有些检查小组及建设单位的报告，初步发现有些重点建设单位在准备工作中存在着严重的问题。
    一、组织机构不健全，缺乏强有力的领导。如重工业部有色金属工业管理局云南东川矿务局今年的建设任务很大，但直到检查时该局工程公司还没有经理，必要的行政机构如设计处、基本建设处、地质处、工程技术处、设备处也都未成立，已成立起来的或者是有工作人员没有处长或者是有处长没有工作人员。大连化学工厂工程公司的经理由大连化学工厂副厂长兼任，还因病不能参加工作；七个工区才成立两个，其余工区主任虽已抽调，但迟迟未正式工作，其中两个工区主任还在帮助搞设计，要在半年后才能到职；其他各科、股亦未充实。太原化学工厂工区在过去两年的基本建设工作中，已走了不少弯路，现在仍未重视基本建设工作，该单位的工程公司只有四名技术人员，其中只有工程师一名。
    二、由于上述原因，影响了各项准备工作的进行，拖迟了工程进度。东川矿务局虽然集结了不小的设计力量，但无人领导，思想上不统一，许多问题争论不休。如该矿务局某项工程设计上的一个问题，自去年十一月争论到现在，直至中央重工业部有色金属工业管理局明确指示后才算了结。该矿区工程国内设计部分本来计划在二月底完成，可是根据目前情况看来，三月底也难以完成。由于设计进度迟缓，东川矿务局一月份土木建筑工程只完成计划的百分之五十，十项安装工程除了一个已完成计划，另一个完成计划的百分之二十外，其余八项都未能按计划及时开工。大连化学工厂也没有抓紧设计工作，如某厂房要在今年完工，但土木建筑设计还未开始，连厂房地基的钻探工作也未进行。该厂工程公司供应科的工作人员除供应一九五二年结转工程的材料外，正整理材料帐目，今年的材料准备工作还未动手。在设备方面，尚有大批的大型铸钢件、铸铁件的铸造及加工，尚无人承制。太原化学工厂工区工程公司的准备也未能很好地展开，如工区上缺水缺电，该公司还未提出任何解决办法。
    三、甲乙双方责任不清，互相推诿，影响准备工作。如大连化学工厂的基本建设科科长对工程公司说：“今后完成任务的责任在工程公司”，而工程公司则说：“甲方还没有正式交任务给我们，我们不管”。太原化学工厂工区的甲方对乙方说：“我只管出钱，你办事”，乙方则认为：“我有多大力量办到那儿算那儿”。直到检查时，大连化学工厂工程公司大多数干部对怎样完成今年任务还是心中无数，对工程程序、工程进度也没有全面地细致地考虑，自制设备如何进行制造也未安排，设备、材料供应工作如何进行也没有商讨。太原化学工厂工区工程公司因为采用包工不包料的方式，就坐等甲方供应材料；甲方因设计未完无法着手供应，因此材料尚未运入工地。
    以上几个单位基本建设准备工作中的问题，正在检查过程中设法改进，大连化学工厂已开始好转。
