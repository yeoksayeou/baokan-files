Xinhua News Agency, 20th. U.S. Far East Commander Clark has gone to Vietnam for a “visit,” stepping up activities to expand the Far East aggressive war of "using Asians to fight Asians." Clark left Tokyo on the 17th, passed through Manila, and arrived in Saigon on the 19th. At the same time, France sent Naval Undersecretary Jacques Gavini, Air Force Undersecretary Pierre Montel, and French Ambassador to Japan Dejean to Vietnam to prepare for talks with Clark.

According to International News Service, Clark’s purpose is to urge France to accelerate the expansion of the Bao Dai puppet army according to the U.S. plan and to "begin implementing a new plan for unified coordination of the Asian anti-communist war." Its "most direct result will be the establishment of a French training program in Indochina to train indigenous troops of the French Federation members, just like the training of South Korean troops in Korea." The British "Manchester Guardian" predicted that Clark would ask France to make a request that "France seems unlikely to concede," allowing Bao Dai to directly obtain U.S. military supplies.

The U.S. government's ambitious attempt to seize control of the Vietnam War from France has met with fierce opposition from France. The day before Clark arrived in Saigon, French Minister for Relations with the French Indochina Federation, Letourneau, publicly stated: "France has nothing to hide. The U.S. military mission has had various opportunities to obtain information from all aspects. ... Because France is responsible for Indochina, it insists on having full command of the war in Indochina, just as the United States insists on having full command of the Korean War." Regarding the issue of how U.S. supplies are used in Vietnam, Letourneau also expressed unwillingness for the U.S. to interfere. He said: The United States can have full power of inspection, "but I am here to implement French policy." United Press also said: "There is no indication that French military leaders are willing to accept U.S. advice on how to train and organize this (Bao Dai) army."

    克拉克到越南进行阴谋活动
    【新华社二十日讯】美国远东军司令克拉克到越南“访问”，加紧进行“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的扩大远东侵略战争的活动。克拉克在十七日离开东京，经过马尼拉，在十九日到达西贡。同时，法国曾派海军次长雅克·加维尼、空军次长皮埃尔·蒙戴尔和法国驻日本大使德让到越南去，准备和克拉克会谈。
    克拉克此行的目的，据国际新闻社透露，他是督促法国依照美国的计划加紧扩充保大伪军，并“开始实行关于统一配合亚洲的反共战争的新计划。”它的“最直接结果，将是在印度支那订立一个法国训练计划，来训练法兰西联邦成员国的土著部队，像在朝鲜对韩军进行的那种训练一样。”英国“曼彻斯特卫报”预料：克拉克将向法国提出“法国似乎不会让步”的让保大直接取得美国军火的要求。
    美国政府野心勃勃地想夺取法国对越南战争的控制权，已遭到法国的激烈反对。在克拉克到达西贡的前一天，法国印度支那联邦成员国关系部长勒杜尔诺已经公开地说：“法国没有什么可以隐藏的。美国的军事使团已有各种机会得到任何方面的情报。……因为法国在印度支那负有责任，所以它坚持在印度支那的战争上要有指挥上的全权，也像美国坚持在朝鲜战争上要有指挥的全权一样。”关于美国供应品在越南如何使用的问题，勒杜尔诺也表示不愿意美国插手。他说：美国可以有检查的全权，“不过我是在这里执行法国的政策”。合众社也说：“没有迹象证明法国的军事领袖愿意在如何训练和组织这支（保大）军队的问题上接受美国的意见。”
