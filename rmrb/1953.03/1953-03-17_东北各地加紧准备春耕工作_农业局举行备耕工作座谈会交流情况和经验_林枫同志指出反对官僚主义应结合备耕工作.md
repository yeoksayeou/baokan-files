    To promote accelerated spring plowing preparation work in various areas, the Northeast Administrative Committee Agricultural Bureau convened a symposium on preparing for spring plowing work from February 20th to 25th, bringing together responsible comrades from the agricultural departments (bureaus) of various provinces (municipalities), agricultural section chiefs from some counties, heads of technical guidance stations, and a number of agricultural labor models. Comrades from the rural work departments of the CCP provincial committees and county committees also were invited to participate.
    According to reports from comrades from various regions: since the symposium on promoting the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience was held in mid-January, leading cadres in various regions have enhanced their understanding and clarified their approaches. The work of promoting the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience has gradually unfolded extensively, powerfully promoting the preparation for spring plowing. However, after the widespread launch of the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience promotion work, cadres' leadership, mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and material preparations in various regions generally lagged behind. Some cadres did not understand the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, were unable to combine it with summarizing local high-yield experiences, and educate the peasants according to the local farming conditions. Therefore, the publicity was not deep or thorough. Although many peasants verbally expressed their intention to learn from the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, they still prepared seeds and fertilizers as they had in previous years. Some cadres were satisfied with general publicity and mobilization and did not do specific organizational work, so problems such as insufficient labor, fertilizer, and seeds were not resolved. Many mutual aid and cooperation organizations have not improved and are unable to meet the requirements of implementing new cultivation methods.
    Everyone believes that leading organs in various regions should earnestly check whether manure, seeds, farm tools, etc., have been prepared according to the needs of the new cultivation methods. If there is insufficient manure, local research should be conducted to find sources of manure; if there are not enough seeds, they should be exchanged quickly. To strengthen leadership, some places are preparing to organize a group of cadres familiar with agricultural technology to go to key promotion areas to implement leadership on a contracted basis; some places plan to adopt the apprenticeship method to solve the difficulty of weak leadership.
    To consolidate and improve mutual aid and cooperation organizations, ensure the promotion of new cultivation methods, and ensure the completion of production plans, the meeting proposed that the policy of "active leadership, steady progress" should be earnestly implemented, and focused on discussing strengthening labor organization and rationally using and calculating labor. The meeting criticized the two deviations currently existing in establishing labor organizations and calculating labor: one is that without considering production needs and the experience of cooperative members, they attempt to immediately set up a set of advanced labor organization forms, resulting in formalism. The other is that they do not realize that mutual aid and cooperation organizations must have sound labor organizations to exert their superiority, and they do not fully understand the complexity of establishing labor organizations, failing to lead actively and allowing things to drift.
    Currently, some rural work cadres believe that mutual aid teams "collapse every year, always the same old problems," and feel uninterested, so they do not study and solve the problems existing in the mutual aid teams and help them improve; others believe that there are already relatively advanced agricultural production cooperatives, and the existence of mutual aid teams will "last no more than three or four years at most," so they do not actively lead. Everyone at the meeting criticized this incorrect attitude, recognized that mutual aid teams exist in large numbers today, and only by doing a good job in mutual aid teams can a foundation be laid for the universal establishment of production cooperatives; without the organizational foundation of a large number of mutual aid teams, the implementation of new cultivation methods and the promotion of new farm tools would lose their guarantee. The key to improving mutual aid teams lies in implementing the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, implementing technology to increase production, doing a good job in labor organization, and improving labor efficiency to exert its superiority; and the principle of gradual improvement from small to large should be earnestly implemented to overcome the deviation of blindly organizing teams with shared carts and horses, large teams, and blindly accumulating public property within the teams.
    On the last day of the meeting, Comrade Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, made important instructions at the meeting. He first pointed out that there is only one month left before spring plowing, and various regions must seize the time to do a good job in preparing for spring plowing; if the preparation work is not done well, delaying a spring means delaying a year. He instructed that all provinces and counties should conduct an inspection of the preparation for spring plowing. Problems found during the inspection should be resolved on the spot and reported to the higher authorities promptly. Good leadership experiences in spring plowing preparation work should be disseminated. Secondly, Comrade Lin Feng said: There was very little snowfall in Northeast China last winter, and the threat of spring drought to agricultural production is very high. Therefore, early action should be taken to prepare for drought prevention and resistance. Thirdly, regarding the question of whether the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience should be promoted comprehensively or with a focus, Comrade Lin Feng gave clear instructions: The leadership style and leadership methods of Zhaoyuan should be promoted universally. The high-yield experience of Zhaoyuan should also be widely publicized, but specific work should be promoted with a focus according to conditions. The area of promotion should generally be adapted to this year's high-yield fields, and the deviation of formalism should be prevented and overcome. Fourthly, this year, the entire region plans to establish one thousand agricultural technical guidance stations, but only four hundred and sixty-five have been established so far. According to this situation, Comrade Lin Feng instructed: To establish technical guidance stations, we must adhere to the policy of doing a good job, establishing one is one, and we must never force a number. Provinces and counties should strengthen their leadership over the technical guidance stations and not leave them to the districts. Fifthly, the work of state-owned farms was systematically summarized last year. This year, all state-owned farms are required to have a new look. During the autumn harvest, they must demonstrate the superiority of state-owned agriculture, that is, to produce more grain than the masses.
    Finally, Comrade Lin Feng focused on analyzing and criticizing the phenomena of bureaucracy, coercion, and violations of law and discipline existing in rural work. He pointed out that it is necessary to combine spring plowing preparation work with the fight against bureaucracy and commandism to earnestly do a good job in preparing for spring plowing. He asked all provinces and counties to carefully study and summarize the work experience at the grassroots level so that rural work cadres can learn to use the working methods of mass work to complete tasks, rather than using commandist methods to complete tasks. Comrade Lin Feng emphasized that leading cadres at all levels must overcome bureaucratic work styles, understand their work, study their work, inspect work, and understand the situation. They must faithfully implement the Party's policies, study the Party's policies, so that cadres and the masses can understand the Party's policies, strengthen the mass viewpoint, and establish mass supervision, so that bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline will have no place to stand.

    东北各地加紧准备春耕工作
    农业局举行备耕工作座谈会交流情况和经验
    林枫同志指出反对官僚主义应结合备耕工作
    为了推动各地加速做好春耕准备工作，东北行政委员会农业局在二月二十日到二十五日，召集各省（市）人民政府农业厅（局）负责同志、部分县的农业科长、技术指导站站长和一部分农业劳动模范举行准备春耕工作座谈会；并邀请了中共各省省委农村工作部和部分县的县委的同志参加。
    据各地到会同志汇报：自一月中旬举行推广肇源丰产经验座谈会后，各地领导干部提高了认识，明确了作法，推广肇源丰产经验工作，逐渐广泛展开，并有力地推动了准备春耕工作。但在推广肇源丰产经验工作广泛展开后，各地普遍发生了干部领导、互助合作组织以及物质准备等方面跟不上的现象。有的干部不懂肇源丰产经验，不能结合总结当地丰产经验，根据当地的耕作情况向农民进行教育，因此宣传得不深不透，很多农民口头上虽表示学习肇源丰产经验，但仍照往年一样去准备种子和肥料。有的干部只满足一般宣传动员，不做具体组织工作，因此人工、肥料、种子不足等问题没有解决。很多互助合作组织没有提高，不能适应推行新耕作法的要求。
    大家认为：各地领导机关应切实检查一下粪肥、种子、农具等是否按新耕作法的需要做了准备。如果粪不足，应就地研究挖掘粪源；种子不够也要赶紧串换。为了加强领导力量，有的地方准备组织一批熟悉农业技术的干部到重点推广区，实行分片包干的领导；有的地方计划采取带徒弟方式，解决领导力量弱的困难。
    为了巩固和提高互助合作组织，保证新耕作法的推广，保证完成生产计划，会议提出应切实贯彻“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，并着重讨论了加强劳动组织，合理地使用和计算劳动的问题。会议批判了目前在建立劳动组织和计算劳动中存在的两种偏向：一种是不根据生产需要和社员的经验，企图马上就搞起一套高级的劳动组织形式，结果流于形式。另一种是没有认识到互助合作组织必须有健全的劳动组织才能发挥优越性，对建立劳动组织的复杂性认识不足，不积极领导，放任自流。
    目前有部分农村工作干部认为互助组是“年年搞年年垮，总是老一套的问题”，觉得没有兴趣，就不去研究和解决互助组中存在的问题，帮助提高；还有的人认为现在已经有了较先进的农业生产合作社，互助组存在的时间“顶多不过三四年”，便不去积极领导。大家在会议上批判了这种不正确的态度，认清了互助组在今天是大量存在的，而且只有把互助组搞好了，才能给普遍建立生产合作社打下基础；没有大量互助组的组织基础，实行新耕作法、推广新式农具也就失去了保证。提高互助组的关键在于贯彻肇源丰产经验，实行技术增产，搞好劳动组织，提高劳动效率，以发挥其优越性；并应切实贯彻由小到大逐步提高的原则，克服盲目组织车马公有制的组、大型组与盲目在组内积累公有财产的偏向。
    会议的最后一天，东北行政委员会副主席林枫同志到会作了重要指示。他首先指出目前离春耕只有一个月时间，各地必须抓紧时间做好春耕准备工作；如果备耕工作做不好，耽误一春就是耽误一年。他指示各省县都要做一次备耕工作的检查。检查中发现问题要就地解决，并迅速向上级反映。对于备耕工作做得好的，应该传播他们的好的领导经验。其次，林枫同志说：去年冬季东北下雪很少，春旱现象对农业生产的威胁很大。因此要早动手做好防旱抗旱准备工作。第三，关于肇源丰产经验是全面推广还是重点推广的问题，林枫同志做了明确指示：肇源的领导作风和领导方法应该普遍推广。肇源的丰产经验也应该广泛宣传，但具体工作应根据条件有重点的推行，推广的面积一般可以和今年的丰产田相适应，应防止和克服形式主义的偏向。第四，今年全区计划建立一千个农业技术指导站，但现在只建立起四百六十五个。根据这种情况，林枫同志指示：建立技术指导站，必须坚持办好的方针，办一个是一个，绝不能勉强凑数。各省县应当加强对技术指导站的领导，不能交给区上就不管了。第五，去年已系统地总结了国营农场的工作，今年要求各国营农场必须有一个新的面貌，秋收时一定要表现出国营农业的优越性，即要比群众多打粮食。
    最后林枫同志着重分析批判了农村工作里存在着的官僚主义、强迫命令和违法乱纪现象。指出必须结合备耕工作，反对官僚主义和命令主义，把春耕准备工作切实做好。要求各省县很好地研究和总结基层工作经验，使农村工作干部学会用群众工作的工作方法来完成任务，而不是用命令主义的方法去完成任务。林枫同志着重指出：各级领导干部要克服官僚主义作风，必须懂得业务，钻研业务，检查工作，了解情况。要忠实地贯彻党的政策，要学习党的政策，使干部和群众都了解党的政策，加强群众观点，建立群众的监督，这样才能使官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪行为全无容身之地。
