The General Administration of Coal Mine Management Implements the Policy of Focusing on Key Construction Projects; Reviews the Drilling Engineering Plans of Various Mining Bureaus for This Year

The Ministry of Fuel Industry's General Administration of Coal Mine Management (hereinafter referred to as the Coal Mine Administration) earnestly implemented the policy of concentrating efforts on the key development of coking coal and industrial coal when reviewing the drilling engineering plans of various mining bureaus for this year, and drastically reduced non-priority projects in the drilling plans of various mining bureaus.

The drilling plans of various mining bureaus this year are very large, but the proportion of drilling projects for important mines in the plans is relatively small. Taking the drilling plan of the Jingxi Mining Bureau as an example, drilling for production accounted for 21 percent, drilling for restoration and reconstruction projects accounted for 47 percent, and drilling engineering to prepare data for the construction of new mines accounted for only 32 percent. Moreover, many of the production-related drillings are not urgently needed, and not drilling will have no or very little impact on production. For example, according to production needs, the Chengzi Mine under the management of the Jingxi Mining Bureau originally only had more than 2,900 meters of drilling engineering, and it was stipulated that construction should only begin after the completion of key projects. However, the Jingxi Mining Bureau groundlessly increased the drilling engineering of the Chengzi Mine to more than 5,300 meters in the plan. In the plan, the drilling for restoration and reconstruction projects, which accounted for the largest proportion, also included many that were not included in the state plan. In terms of the construction of new mines, the Jingxi Mining Bureau blindly included more than 1,600 meters of new district drilling engineering in this year's plan without following the state's regulations. The drilling plans of many mining bureaus are similar to those of the Jingxi Mining Bureau. This large plan without focus fully demonstrates the mentality of "everything needs to be rebuilt" among the leading cadres of various mining bureaus. They ignored the current weak drilling capacity and the extreme shortage of drilling equipment (some important equipment must be ordered from abroad), and did not understand the policy of concentrating existing forces to do a good job in key projects. They blindly formulated plans and wanted to take care of everything, which will inevitably lead to nothing being accomplished and will inevitably delay the construction of coking coal and other industrial coal mines that are most urgently needed for national economic construction. In order to ensure that the construction of important mines does not fail, the Coal Mine Administration reduced the drilling engineering projects initially proposed by various mining bureaus by forty. The reduced projects account for 57 percent of the currently retained projects. Such reductions will not have an impact on production, because the projects that have been reduced or postponed are not urgently needed at present. For example, the drilling engineering of the Lifeng Mine of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau was postponed to the fourth quarter, which has no impact on this year's production and can meet the needs of next year's production in a timely manner.

In the process of reducing the drilling plan, the Coal Mine Administration encountered many ideological obstacles. Although repeated explanations and mobilizations were carried out, the leading cadres of many units still could not understand. They were afraid that their production would be affected, and they all felt that they should quickly drill their mining areas clearly in order to develop production. The leading cadres of the Jingxi Mining Bureau always emphasized that the mines in Jingxi should supply coal to the capital, so some mines need to be developed, and not drilling some mines will affect production. They requested to retain more projects, and even after the plan was reviewed, they still requested to drill new coalfields that were not included in the state plan.

After the Coal Mine Administration reviewed the drilling engineering plans of various mining bureaus, coal mines such as Datong, Jiawang, and Huainan have begun to allocate forces and carry out drilling work according to the key construction procedures. However, there are still a few units, such as the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, that have not earnestly implemented the policy of concentrating efforts on key projects in construction. The Coal Mine Administration once instructed the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau to concentrate drilling forces to prepare data for the Macun Mine designed abroad, but the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau has not changed its past practice of decentralized construction, placing six of the existing fourteen drilling rigs in the Lifeng Mine, which has a small amount of reserves and has been determined to be drilled in the fourth quarter, and three drilling rigs in the Thirty-Nine Mine, leaving only five drilling rigs in the Macun Mine. The design data of the Macun Mine must be submitted in the first quarter, and now there are still eight boreholes that have not been completed, three of which have not yet been constructed. If the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau does not quickly strengthen the drilling force of the Macun Mine, it will affect the design progress. (Yan Qiang)

### 煤矿管理总局贯彻重点施工的方针  审核各矿务局今年钻探工程计划

    煤矿管理总局贯彻重点施工的方针
    审核各矿务局今年钻探工程计划
    中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局（以下简称煤矿总局），在审核各矿务局今年钻探工程计划时，认真贯彻了集中力量重点发展炼焦煤和工业用煤的方针，大刀阔斧地削减了各矿务局钻探计划中的非重点工程。
    各矿务局今年的钻探计划都非常庞大，但是，在计划中，重要矿井钻探工程所占的比重则较小。以京西矿务局的钻探计划为例，生产方面的钻孔占百分之二十一，恢复与改建工程的钻孔占百分之四十七，为新矿井的建设准备资料的钻探工程仅占百分之三十二。而且，生产方面的钻孔，有不少是并不急需的，不打钻，对生产也没有影响或者影响很小。例如京西矿务局管理的城子矿，根据生产的需要，原来只有二千九百多公尺的钻探工程，并且规定在重点工程完工后才施工，但是，京西矿务局却毫无根据地在计划中将城子矿的钻探工程增加到五千三百多公尺。在计划中占比重最大的恢复与改建工程的钻孔，也有许多不在国家计划之内。就在新矿井的建设方面，京西矿务局也不按照国家的规定，盲目地把一千六百多公尺的新区钻探工程列入了今年的计划。各矿务局的钻探计划很多和京西矿务局的类似。这种无重点的庞大计划，充分表现了各矿务局领导干部的百废俱兴的思想。他们忽视了目前钻探力量薄弱、钻探设备异常缺乏（有些重要器材必须向国外订货）的困难情况，不知道集中现有力量做好重点工程的方针，盲目编制计划，想处处兼顾，结果，必然会样样落空，必然会耽误国家经济建设最迫切需要的炼焦煤和其它工业用煤的矿井建设。煤矿总局为了保证重要矿井的建设不至落空，把各矿务局初步提出的钻探工程项目，削减了四十件。削减的项目占现在保留的工程项目百分之五十七。这样的削减，对生产并不会有影响，因为减去的或推迟的工程项目都不是目前所急需的。例如焦作矿务局李封矿的钻探工程被推迟到第四季度，对今年的生产没有影响，而且能够及时维持明年生产的需要。
    煤矿总局在削减钻探计划的过程中，曾经遇到了许多思想障碍。虽然经过了一再的解释动员，许多单位的领导干部仍然想不通。他们怕自己的生产受影响，都觉得应该赶快把自己的矿区钻探清楚，以便发展生产。京西矿务局的领导干部总是强调京西各矿要供给首都用煤，因此，有的矿需要发展，有的矿不打钻要影响生产。他们要求多保留一些项目，直到计划审核完了后，还要求钻探不在国家计划之内的新煤田。
    煤矿总局审核各矿务局钻探工程计划以后，大同、贾汪、淮南等煤矿，已根据重点施工程序开始调配力量，进行钻探工作。但是，还有少数单位，如焦作矿务局，在施工中还没有认真贯彻集中力量搞好重点工程的方针。煤矿总局曾经指示焦作矿务局集中钻探力量为在国外设计的马村矿井准备资料，但焦作矿务局还没有改变过去分散施工的作法，把现有十四台钻机中的六台放在埋藏量不大的而且已经确定在第四季度钻探的李封矿，还有三台钻机放在三十九号矿井，马村矿井只剩下五台钻机。马村矿井的设计资料须在第一季度中提出，现在，还有八个钻孔没有完成，其中有三个钻孔还没有施工。焦作矿务局如不赶快加强马村矿井的钻探力量，就会影响设计进度。（燕蔷）
