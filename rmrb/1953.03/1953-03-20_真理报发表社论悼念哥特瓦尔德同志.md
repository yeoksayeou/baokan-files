Xinhua News Agency: *Pravda* published an editorial on the 19th, deeply mourning Klement Gottwald.

*Pravda* said: The death of Comrade Klement Gottwald has deprived the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the working people of a great leader, a tireless and fearless fighter for the construction of socialism in Czechoslovakia. The working people of the world have lost one of the most outstanding activists of the international workers' movement; Comrade Klement Gottwald dedicated his entire life, the noble life of a proletarian revolutionary, to this movement.

After recounting the life of Klement Gottwald, *Pravda* wrote: From the time he joined the workers' movement, he tirelessly fought against all enemies of the working class, against the agents of the bourgeoisie—opportunists and all kinds of compromisers. As the leader of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Klement Gottwald tirelessly fought for united working-class action against the growing threat of fascism and fascist dictatorship on the eve of the Second World War. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia has consistently fought for the interests of the working class and the interests of the various ethnic groups of Czechoslovakia. During the difficult years of the Second World War, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, led by Comrade Gottwald, led the Czechoslovak people in the anti-fascist national liberation struggle. During the war, the party's prestige among the working people further increased.

*Pravda* continued: After Czechoslovakia was liberated, the Czechoslovak people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and its leader Klement Gottwald, embarked on the road of carrying out extensive social reforms. The Czechoslovak people have made significant achievements in socialist construction. Their achievements have angered the imperialists, who instructed their agents who had infiltrated the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia to intensify their activities. However, thanks to the vigilance and decisiveness of Comrade Gottwald, the "fifth column" of a gang of vile and shameless Trotskyites and Zionist conspirators, spies and murderers, headed by Slánský, was uncovered and crushed.

*Pravda* pointed out: Klement Gottwald was a proletarian revolutionary and an outstanding activist of the international workers' movement, who consistently fought against the imperialist oppressors, for lasting international peace, and for the victory of democracy and socialist ideas.

*Pravda* concluded: The death of Klement Gottwald is a major loss for the entire international workers' movement and for the working people of the world. The glorious image of Klement Gottwald, a faithful student of Lenin and a comrade-in-arms of Stalin, his noble life as a staunch revolutionary, will always be an example to inspire fighters for peace, democracy, and socialism.

    真理报发表社论悼念哥特瓦尔德同志
    据新华社讯：真理报十九日发表深切悼念克利门特·哥特瓦尔德的社论。
    真理报说：克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志的逝世，使捷克斯洛伐克共产党和劳动人民失去了一个伟大的领袖，一个为在捷克斯洛伐克建设社会主义而奋斗的不倦的、无畏的战士。全世界劳动人民失去了国际工人运动最杰出的活动家之一；克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志为了这个运动献出了他整个的生命、一个无产阶级革命者的崇高的生命。
    真理报在叙述了克利门特·哥特瓦尔德的生平后写道：从参加工人运动起，他就不倦地对工人阶级的一切敌人，对资产阶级的代理人——机会主义者和形形色色的妥协分子——进行斗争。作为捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领袖，克利门特·哥特瓦尔德在第二次世界大战前夕，就坚持不懈地为统一工人阶级的行动来反对日益紧迫的法西斯主义和法西斯专政的威胁而奋斗。捷克斯洛伐克共产党始终不懈地为工人阶级的利益、为捷克斯洛伐克各族人民的利益而斗争。在第二次世界大战的困难的年代中，以哥特瓦尔德同志为首的捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导捷克斯洛伐克人民进行反法西斯主义的民族解放斗争。在大战时期，党在劳动人民中的威望进一步提高了。
    真理报接着说：在捷克斯洛伐克获得解放后，捷克斯洛伐克人民在共产党和它的领袖克利门特·哥特瓦尔德的领导下，走上了进行广泛的社会改革的道路。捷克斯洛伐克人民在社会主义建设方面取得了重大的成就。他们的成就使帝国主义者感到恼怒，帝国主义者指使混入捷克斯洛伐克共产党内的他们的代理人加紧进行活动。但是，由于哥特瓦尔德同志的警惕和果断，以斯兰斯基为首的一帮卑鄙无耻的托洛茨基分子和犹太复国主义分子阴谋家、间谍和杀人犯的“第五纵队”被破获和被粉碎了。
    真理报指出：克利门特·哥特瓦尔德是一个无产阶级革命家，是国际工人运动杰出活动家，他始终不渝地为反对帝国主义压迫者，为争取国际持久和平，为民主和社会主义思想的胜利而进行斗争。
    真理报最后说：克利门特·哥特瓦尔德的逝世对于整个国际工人运动，对于全世界的劳动人民是一个重大的损失。列宁的忠实学生、斯大林的战友克利门特·哥特瓦尔德的光辉形象，他那坚强的革命家崇高的一生将经常成为鼓舞和平、民主和社会主义战士的榜样。
