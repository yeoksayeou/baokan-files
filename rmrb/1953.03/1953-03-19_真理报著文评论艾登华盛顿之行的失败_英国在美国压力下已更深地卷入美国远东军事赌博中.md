Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 18th: TASS Moscow, March 15th dispatch: Commenting on British Foreign Secretary Eden and Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler's trip to Washington, *Pravda* commentator P. Yefimov said: The unbearable burden of heavy armaments and the ban on trade with countries of the democratic camp are creating a large foreign trade deficit for Britain, depleting its gold and dollar reserves, and thus increasing American control over Britain. According to Butler, it is precisely because of "American aid" that Britain's gold and dollar reserves have decreased by almost fifty percent - from $3.8 billion before the arms expansion movement to the current $2 billion.

Yefimov recounted that Britain had made long and thorough preparations before negotiating with the new American government. As early as last December, the British government held an economic conference of Commonwealth Prime Ministers. The meeting formulated measures to combat the US policy of "suppressing" raw material prices. The meeting also raised the issue of raising the price of gold.

In the suggestions, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference clearly emphasized the need to reduce American tariffs, as American tariffs hinder British goods from entering the United States.

In order to balance trade between the sterling area and the dollar area, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference formulated measures for the free convertibility of the pound, that is, "the pound can be freely converted into dollars." In this regard, the meeting suggested raising a so-called currency stabilization fund, with the United States contributing billions of dollars to ensure the stability of the pound, whose actual value is constantly falling.

The *Pravda* commentator wrote: These were the suggestions that the two British ministers brought to Washington. But they were greatly disappointed. It can be seen from the communique on the results of the talks that American representatives were willing to treat the relaxation of trade restrictions and discrimination, and the free convertibility of the pound, as ultimate goals (!). As for the price of gold, the United States was unwilling to discuss it, even as a vague and distant goal.

Yefimov wrote: It is quite obvious that on major economic issues, these negotiations were a failure. In order to conceal this, on political issues, the communique stated that both governments hoped that the "European Defense Community" agreement would be approved as soon as possible. But reaching an agreement on this point was not difficult, because neither the United States nor Britain is a member of this group, and the agreement to establish this group does not require approval by the British Parliament.

Britain also promised that its ships would no longer carry goods to the People's Republic of China; in exchange, the United States announced that Britain's suggestions on the Iranian oil issue were "fair and reasonable."

Yefimov wrote: The economic negotiations show that America's previous attitude has not changed at all. On political issues, these negotiations only proved that under American pressure, Britain is more deeply involved in the American aggressors' military gamble in the Far East. The communique also shows that the US and Britain have increased pressure on Iran. But there, the interests of British and American oil companies are by no means consistent.

    真理报著文评论艾登华盛顿之行的失败
    英国在美国压力下已更深地卷入美国远东军事赌博中
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：在评论英国外交大臣艾登与财政大臣巴特勒华盛顿之行时，“真理报”评论员普·叶菲莫夫说：不堪忍受的沉重的军备负担和不准与民主阵营国家贸易的禁令，正在造成英国很大的对外贸易逆差，消耗了它的黄金美元储备，并从而增加了美国对英国的控制。据巴特勒说，正是由于“美国援助”，英国的黄金美元储备才减少了几乎百分之五十——从扩军运动开始前的三十八亿美元降到目前的二十亿美元。
    叶菲莫夫追述说：英国在与美国新政府谈判前曾进行长期周密的准备工作。早在去年十二月，英国政府便举行了英联邦总理经济会议。会议上订出了措施，来与美国“压低”原料价格的政策斗争。会议还提出了提高黄金价格的问题。
    在建议中，联邦总理会议明白强调需要减低美国关税，因为美国关税阻碍英国货物进入美国。
    为了使英镑区和美元区之间的贸易达到平衡，英联邦总理会议拟定了英镑自由兑换的措施，那就是“英镑可以自由兑换成美元”。在这方面，会议建议筹措一项所谓货币稳定基金，由美国拿出几十亿美元来保证实际价值正在不断跌落的英镑的稳定。
    “真理报”评论员写道：这就是两位英国大臣带到华盛顿去的建议。但是他们却大失所望。从关于会谈结果的公报中可以看出：美国代表们愿意把放宽贸易限制和歧视以及使英镑自由兑换当做最终的目的（！）。至于黄金的价格，即使把它当做一个模糊而遥远的目标，美国也不愿意讨论。
    叶菲莫夫写道：十分明显，在主要经济问题上，这些谈判是失败了。为要掩饰这点，在政治问题上，这个公报说，两国政府都希望“欧洲防务集团”协定尽早得到批准。但是在这一点上达到一个协议是不困难的，因为美国和英国都不是这个集团的成员国，而成立这个集团的协定也不需要英国议会批准。
    英国并答应它的船只不再载运货物到中华人民共和国；作为交换条件，美国就宣布英国关于伊朗石油问题的建议是“公平合理的”。
    叶菲莫夫写道：经济问题的谈判说明，美国从前的态度一点也没有改变。在政治问题上，这些谈判只不过证明在美国压力之下英国更深地卷入了美国侵略者在远东的军事赌博中。这个公报也说明英美对伊朗增加了压力。但是在那里，英国石油公司和美国石油公司的利益决不是一致的。
