    In order to mourn the passing of Comrade Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the great leader of the world's working people and the most beloved friend and teacher of the Chinese people, all commemorative activities originally planned across the country for "March 8th" International Women's Day are hereby ceased. Important reports related to "March 8th" may be conveyed to the masses of women and cadres at an appropriate time using other methods. Women's federations at all levels should better follow the path of women's liberation indicated by Comrade Stalin, learn from the advanced example of Soviet women, redouble their efforts in their work, and strive for the construction of the motherland, for the defense of world peace, and for the protection of women's rights and children's welfare.
