    Introducing "The Principles of Soviet Marriage and Family Legislation"
    Chang Dong
    Written by Sverdlov, translated by Li Shikai, published by People's Publishing House

    The book "The Principles of Soviet Marriage and Family Legislation" provides a detailed description of the content and spirit of Soviet marriage and family law, which is extremely helpful for us to understand communist marriage and family morality.

    The book is divided into six chapters: The Development Process of Soviet Marriage and Family Legislation; The Soviet Family and its Task of Consolidation; Conditions and Forms of Marriage; Rights and Obligations of Family Members; Divorce; Conclusion.

    In the book, the author detailed the powerless status and oppressed situation of women in the old society. In capitalist society, family relations are "purely monetary relations" ("Communist Manifesto"). "The interests of the private owner play a decisive role, whether in the formation of the family or in all mutual relations between husband and wife and parents and children." (Original book, page 11) Therefore, women in the old society were in a state of powerlessness both economically and politically, and were at the mercy of others.

    For example, "In some states in the United States, the wife's income and wages are controlled by the husband as the 'administrator of common property,' and in some other states in the United States, the wife must obtain the husband's consent to complete certain legal acts." (Page 42) There are also "laws in some individual states that restrict the inheritance rights of married women. For example, in Nevada, a wife's right to dispose of common property by will is less than that of her husband." (Page 43)

    In Tsarist Russia, "Tsarist law stipulated very broad paternal rights. Tsarist law always despised the personality of illegitimate children and their mothers. The divorce system, which was formerly managed by the church (through ecclesiastical courts), actually implemented a system of preventing divorce, which insulted the reputation of divorced people, especially the reputation of women." (Page 2)

    All of these are, of course, unacceptable under socialism. In capitalist society, women are slaves of the family. The powerless status of women makes them impoverished and causes them to become mentally depressed by being entangled in unpleasant family琐事. In particular, the bourgeoisie treats women as objects of play. Capitalism preserved and developed the buying and selling of marriages and physical abuse of women from feudal society. Only in a society where the working people are in power will the working people thoroughly eliminate the powerless status of women for their own benefit and enable the broad masses of women to actively participate in national construction. Lenin pointed out: "The first and only Soviet regime in the world abolished all the old, bourgeois, despicable laws that placed women in an unequal position with men in terms of marital rights or in relation to children, and endowed men with privileges." (Page 2)

    Marriage is the union of the interests of both men and women. In this union, there is a responsibility to the collective and to society. Socialist marriage should ensure that both men and women obtain the joy of life, so that both can actively devote themselves to the cause of developing society and consolidating the country. Therefore, it is completely wrong to think that marriage is a personal matter and that the state should not interfere. Since society cares about the interests of the collective, it cannot but care about the interests of the individual. As Stalin said:

    "...Socialism does not deny individual interests, but combines individual interests with collective interests. Socialism cannot be separated from individual interests. Only a socialist society can give the fullest satisfaction to such individual interests. In addition, socialist society is the only solid guarantee for protecting individual interests." (Page 7)

    In Chapter 3, the author specifically analyzes the conditions and forms of marriage. The current Soviet marriage law was promulgated in 1944. The law stipulates that only registered marriages obtain the rights and obligations of husband and wife (that is, the state law only protects the interests of both men and women in registered marriages); the conditions for registration are: both parties are free and voluntarily agree, have reached the permissible age of marriage, have no marital relationship with others, and have no close blood relationship that is legally prohibited from marrying. Why does the state care so much about the system of linking the rights and obligations of husband and wife with marriage registration? The book points out: "Because this can promote marital relations in a direction that is beneficial and necessary to society and the individual; and can prevent involuntary and harmful marriages, such as early marriages that are harmful to the health of future generations, marriages that violate communist moral viewpoints, and marriages formed under the influence of coercion, threats, etc." (Pages 27-28 of this book)

    Related to the legislative spirit of marriage is the legislation on divorce. Before 1944, especially before 1936, "the task of adopting some method to prevent divorce had not yet been put forward to the state, because the new, socialist Soviet family system was still in the stage of formation and establishment." (Page 76) At this time, divorce could be approved as long as one party applied. But later, extremely strict adjudication procedures were implemented for divorce, the purpose of which was to restrict people's frivolous attitude towards marriage in order to consolidate communist marriage and family morality.

    The Soviet spirit of legislation is extremely worthy of our reference. Our holding of marriage registration is basically the same as the Soviet Union. We must protect the rights of women in this marriage, and at the same time try to resolve disputes between marriage and family through mediation; because divorce will cause a lot of difficulties for both working people, and is opposed to the long-standing historical habits of millions of people. However, for women who have been severely abused and firmly demand a divorce, we must give support and protect their legal rights (such as the right of women to share property).

    介绍“苏维埃婚姻与家庭的立法原则”
    长冬
    斯维尔德洛夫著　李世楷译  人民出版社出版
    “苏维埃婚姻与家庭的立法原则”一书，对苏联婚姻法与家庭法的内容和精神作了详细的叙述，极有助于我们了解共产主义的婚姻道德与家庭道德。
    本书共分六章：苏维埃婚姻与家庭立法的发展过程；苏维埃家庭及其巩固的任务；结婚条件与结婚形式；家庭成员底权利和义务；离婚；结论。
    作者在书中详细指出了旧社会妇女的无权地位和受压迫的情况。在资本主义社会中，家庭关系是“纯粹的金钱关系”（“共产党宣言”）。“私有者的利益，无论在成立家庭时，或在夫妻间、父母子女间的一切相互关系上都起着决定的作用。”（原书第十一页）因而旧社会的妇女无论在经济上、政治上都处于无权状态，而听人摆弄。
    例如，“在美国某些州里，妻子的收入和工资要由作为‘共同财产管理人’的丈夫来支配，在美国其他某些州里，妻子要完成一定的法律行为则须获得丈夫的同意。”（四二页）还有“某些个别州的法律对已婚妇女的继承权加以限制。比如在尼华达州，妻子立遗嘱处理共有财产的权利是小于丈夫的。”（四三页）
    在沙俄，“沙皇法律规定了非常广泛的父权。沙皇法律从来就卑视非婚生子及其母亲的人格，从前实行过由教会管理（经过教会法庭）的离婚制度，其实这个制度所实行的就是不让离婚，这个制度是侮辱离婚人的名誉，首先是侮辱妇女的名誉。”（二页）
    所有这些，在社会主义之下，当然都是不能容许的。在资本主义社会中妇女是家庭的奴隶，妇女的无权地位使她们贫困，使她们纠缠在不愉快的家庭琐事中而致精神消沉。特别是资产阶级更把妇女当做玩弄的对象。资本主义保存了并且发展了封建社会中的买卖婚姻和对妇女的人身虐待。只有在劳动人民当权的社会中，劳动人民才会为着自己的利益而彻底消灭妇女的无权地位，使广大妇女群众积极参加到国家建设工作中来。列宁指出：“世界上第一个和唯一的苏维埃政权取消了一切旧的、资产阶级的卑劣法律，这些法律，譬如在婚姻权利方面或在对子女的关系方面，都把妇女置于与男人不平等的地位，而对男人则赋以特权。”（二页）
    婚姻关系是男女双方利益的结合。在这种结合中，有了对集体、对社会的责任。社会主义的婚姻关系，应该保证男女双方获得人生的愉快，使双方都能够积极地投身到发展社会和巩固国家的事业中去。因此，以为婚姻是个人问题，国家不得干预，这是完全错误的。社会既然关心集体的利益，也就不能不关心个人的利益。正如斯大林所说：
    “……社会主义并不否认个人利益，而是把个人利益与集体利益结合起来。社会主义是不能撇开个人利益的。只有社会主义社会才能给这种个人利益以最充分的满足。此外，社会主义社会是保护个人利益的唯一牢固的保证。”（七页）
    在第三章中，作者专门分析了结婚条件与结婚形式。目前苏联的婚姻法律是一九四四年颁布的。法律规定：只有已登记的婚姻，才取得夫妻的权利与义务（即国家法律只保护经过登记的婚姻男女双方的利益）；登记的条件是：双方都是自由自愿的同意，达到许可结婚的年龄，和他人没有婚姻关系，没有法律规定不能结婚的亲近血族关系。为什么国家要这样关心夫妻的权利与义务和结婚登记联系起来的制度呢？书中指出：“因为这样就能推动婚姻关系走向对社会和个人有益与必要的方向；并且能阻止发生非自愿的与有害的婚姻，如对后代健康有害的早婚、违反共产主义道德观点的婚姻，在强迫、威胁等等影响下所结成的婚姻。”（本书第二七—二 八页）
    和结婚的立法精神相联的，是关于离婚的立法。在一九四四年以前，特别是在一九三六年以前，“采用某种办法制止离婚的任务还没有在国家面前提出来，这是因为新的、社会主义的苏维埃家庭制度，还在形成和建立的阶段。”（七六页）这时候的离婚只要一方提出申请就可批准。但到后来，就对离婚施行了极其严格的判决程序，其目的为的是限制人们对婚姻的儿戏态度，以巩固共产主义的婚姻和家庭道德。
    苏联这种立法精神是极值得我们借鉴的。我们举办结婚登记，其目的基本上也是和苏联一致的。我们必须保护妇女在这种婚姻中的权利，同时尽量地用调解方式解决婚姻与家庭间的纠纷；因为离婚对于劳动人民的双方都会造成很多的困难，并且和千百万人的长久历史习惯相对立。但对于受严重虐待的妇女坚决要求离婚，则必须予以支持，并保护她们的合法权利（如妇女应有分得财产的权利）。
