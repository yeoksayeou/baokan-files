Dear comrades, friends!

	The extraordinary grief in the hearts of our Party, our people, and all progressive humanity these days is hard to describe in words.

	Stalin, the great comrade-in-arms of Lenin, the brilliant successor to his cause, has passed away. The closest and dearest person to all the Soviet people and hundreds of millions of working people around the world has left us.

	The life and all the activities of the great Stalin are a moving example of loyalty to Leninism, an example of selfless service to the working class and all working people, and to the cause of liberating working people from oppression and exploitation.

	The great Lenin established our Party and led it to the victory of the proletarian revolution.

	Stalin, Lenin's brilliant comrade-in-arms, together with the great Lenin, consolidated the Bolshevik Party and established the first socialist state in the world.

	For nearly thirty years after Lenin's death, Stalin guided our Party and country forward along the path of Lenin. Stalin crushed countless enemies, defended Leninism, and developed and enriched Lenin's doctrine under new historical conditions. The wise leadership of the great Stalin ensured that our people built socialism in the Soviet Union and ensured that the Soviet Union won a victory of world historical significance in the Great Patriotic War. The great communist builder, the brilliant leader, our beloved Stalin armed our Party and people with a grand program of communist construction.

	Comrades! We feel infinite grief in our hearts, and this loss is very heavy, but even in such a heavy situation, the iron will of the Communist Party is unyielding, its unity and firm determination to fight for communism will not waver.

	Our Party is a party armed with the revolutionary theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. It has accumulated fifty years of experience in fighting for the interests of the working class and all working people, so it knows how to work to ensure the construction of a communist society.

	The Central Committee of our Party and the Soviet government have received the great teachings of Lenin and Stalin in leading the country.

	In the flames of the civil war and armed intervention, in the difficult years of healing wounds and overcoming famine, in the struggle for national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, in the arduous years of the Great Patriotic War that determined the fate of the motherland and the fate of all mankind, the Central Committee of the Party and the Soviet government led and guided the heroic struggle of the Soviet people, thus gaining rich experience in leading the Party and the country.

	Therefore, the Soviet people can continue to fully trust the Communist Party, trust the Central Committee of the Party and their Soviet government.

	The enemies of the Soviet state hope that the heavy losses we have suffered will cause division and chaos in our ranks.

	However, their calculations are in vain: a cruel and merciless disappointment awaits them.

	Anyone who is not blind can see that our Party is uniting its ranks more closely in difficult days, our Party is united and unwavering. Anyone who is not blind can see that in these days of grief, the Soviet nationalities and the fraternal unity of the great Russian nation have been more closely united around the Soviet government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party.

	The Soviet people unanimously support the domestic and foreign policies of the Soviet Union.

	The foundation of our domestic policy is the unbreakable alliance of the working class and the collective farmers, the fraternal friendship among our nationalities, and the firm unity of all national Soviet republics in the system of the unified great multi-ethnic state—the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This policy is to further strengthen our country's economic and military strength, further develop the national economy, and maximize the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire Soviet society.

	Our workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals can work peacefully and confidently, knowing that the Soviet government will continue to care for and protect the rights granted to them by the Stalin Constitution.

	Our foreign policy is clear and unambiguous. From the very establishment of the Soviet regime, Lenin stipulated that the Soviet Union's foreign policy was a policy of peace.

	Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause and our wise leader, tirelessly implemented this policy of peace.

	In the future, the Soviet government's foreign policy will remain: Lenin's and Stalin's policy of defending and consolidating peace, opposing the preparation and launching of new wars, and promoting international cooperation and the development of business relations with all countries on the basis of mutual benefit.

	The Soviet government will further consolidate the fraternal alliance and friendship with the great People's Republic of China, the People's Democracies, and the German Democratic Republic, cooperation in the common struggle to safeguard world peace, and extensive economic and cultural cooperation.

	Our foreign brothers and friends can rest assured that the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet people, loyal to the banner of proletarian internationalism and to the banner of Lenin and Stalin, will continue to consolidate and develop friendly ties with the working people of capitalist and colonial countries who are fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism.

	Deep friendship binds our people with the heroic Korean people who are fighting for their independence.

	Our great leaders Lenin and Stalin taught us to tirelessly raise and maintain the vigilance of the Party and the people against the conspiracies of the enemies of the Soviet state.

	Now we should strengthen our vigilance even more.

	Let no one think that the enemies of the Soviet state can catch us off guard.

	To defend the Soviet motherland, our heroic armed forces are equipped with all kinds of modern weapons. Our soldiers, officers, and generals of the army and navy have gained rich experience in the Great Patriotic War, and they will certainly give any aggressor who dares to attack our country the due counterattack.

	The strength and invincibility of our country lie not only in its glorious army tempered in battle.

	The strength of the Soviet state also lies in the unity of the Soviet people and their trust in the leadership of the Soviet society—the Communist Party, and in the people's trust in their Soviet government. The Communist Party and the Soviet government cherish this trust of the people very much.

	The Soviet people unanimously support the resolutions of the Central Committee of our Party, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on implementing extremely important decisions to ensure uninterrupted and correct leadership in all aspects of our country's life.

	One of these important decisions is the appointment of Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov, a brilliant student of Lenin and a loyal comrade-in-arms of Stalin, as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.

	This resolution passed by the highest organs of our Party and state clearly demonstrates that the leadership of the Party and the state is completely united.

	This unity in the leadership of the state is a guarantee for the successful implementation of the domestic and foreign policies formulated by the Party and the government over the years under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin.

	Stalin, like Lenin, left a great legacy to our Party and the state, and we must protect it as we protect the apple of our eye and tirelessly enrich it.

	The great Stalin cultivated many battle-tested leaders who mastered the art of Leninist-Stalinist leadership and united them around him; they bear the historical responsibility of carrying out to the final victory the great cause initiated by Lenin and successfully continued by Stalin.

	Our people can rest assured that the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government will spare no effort or life to maintain the iron-like unity of the Party's ranks and the Party's leadership, consolidate the unbreakable friendship among the Soviet nationalities, strengthen the power of the Soviet state, remain unwavering in their loyalty to the ideas of Marxism-Leninism, and follow the teachings of Lenin and Stalin to guide our country from socialism to communism.

	Eternal glory to our beloved and dear leader and teacher, the great Stalin! (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th (TASS dispatch))

    在莫斯科举行的斯大林追悼会上
    苏联部长会议第一副主席贝利亚的讲话亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    我们的党、我国人民和全体进步人类这几天异常沉痛的心情是很难用言语形容的。
    列宁的伟大的战友、他的事业的天才继承者斯大林逝世了。全体苏联人民、全世界千百万劳动人民最亲密、最亲爱的人离开我们了。
    伟大的斯大林的一生和他的全部活动是忠实于列宁主义的动人的榜样，是为工人阶级和一切劳动人民、为把劳动人民从压迫和剥削下解放出来的事业而忘我服务的榜样。
    伟大的列宁建立了我们的党，领导它获得了无产阶级革命的胜利。
    列宁的天才战友斯大林和伟大的列宁一起，巩固了布尔什维克党，建立了世界上第一个社会主义国家。
    列宁逝世以后，将近三十年的时间斯大林引导着我们的党和国家，沿着列宁的道路前进。斯大林粉碎了无数的敌人，保卫了列宁主义，在新的历史条件下发展了并且丰富了列宁的学说。伟大的斯大林的英明的领导，保证了我们人民在苏联建设成社会主义，保证了苏联在伟大卫国战争中获得具有世界历史意义的胜利。伟大的共产主义建设者、天才的领袖、我们亲爱的斯大林用宏伟的共产主义建设的纲领武装了我们的党和人民。
    同志们！我们心里感到无限的悲痛，这个损失非常沉重，但是就是在这样沉重的情况下，共产党的钢铁的意志也是不屈不挠的，它的团结和为共产主义而斗争的坚强决心是不会动摇的。
    我们的党是用马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的革命理论武装起来的党，它积累了五十年来为工人阶级和全体劳动人民的利益而斗争的经验，因此它知道怎样进行工作，以保证建设成共产主义社会。
    我们党的中央委员会和苏维埃政府在领导国家方面得到了列宁和斯大林的伟大的教导。
    在国内战争和武装干涉的烽火中，在医治创伤和克服饥荒的艰难岁月里，在争取国家工业化和农业集体化的斗争中，在决定祖国命运和全人类命运的伟大卫国战争的艰苦年代里，党中央委员会和苏维埃政府领导和指导了苏联人民进行英勇的斗争，从而也就获得了领导党和国家的丰富经验。
    因此，苏联人民今后也可以完全信任共产党，信任党中央委员会和自己的苏维埃政府。
    苏维埃国家的敌人指望我们遭到的沉重损失会在我们的队伍中引起分歧和混乱。
    但是，他们的盘算是枉费心机的：残酷无情的绝望在等待着他们。
    只要不是瞎子，都能看到：我们的党在困难的日子里，正更加紧密地团结着自己的队伍，我们的党是团结一致的、毫不动摇的。只要不是瞎子，都能看到：在这些悲痛的日子里，苏联各民族和伟大的俄罗斯民族兄弟般地团结一致，已经更加紧密地团结在苏联政府和共产党中央委员会的周围。
    苏联人民一致支持苏联的国内政策和外交政策。
    我们国内政策的基础是工人阶级和集体农民的牢不可破的联盟、我国各民族间的兄弟友谊、所有民族的苏维埃共和国在统一的伟大的多民族国家的体系——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟里面牢固地团结在一起。这个政策是要进一步加强我国的经济和军事的力量，进一步发展国民经济和最大限度地满足整个苏维埃社会不断增长的物质和文化的需要。
    我国的工人、集体农民、知识分子能够安静和有信心地工作，他们知道：苏维埃政府将不断关心地保护斯大林宪法给他们规定的权利。
    我们的外交政策是清楚明白的，从苏维埃政权刚建立的时候起，列宁就规定了苏联的外交政策是和平的政策。
    列宁事业伟大的继承者，我们英明的领袖斯大林不倦地实行这个和平政策。
    今后苏维埃政府的外交政策仍然是：列宁、斯大林的保卫和巩固和平、反对准备和发动新战争的政策，国际合作和在互惠的基础上同各国发展事务关系的政策。
    苏联政府将更加巩固同伟大的中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家及德意志民主共和国之间的兄弟的联盟和友谊，在维护世界和平事业的共同斗争中的合作，以及广泛的经济、文化的合作。
    我们的外国兄弟和朋友们可以相信，忠于无产阶级国际主义的旗帜、忠于列宁和斯大林的旗帜的苏联共产党和苏联人民，将继续巩固和发展跟资本主义国家和殖民地国家为和平、民主、社会主义事业而斗争的劳动人民的友好联系。
    深厚的友情把我国人民和正在为自己的独立而战斗的英勇的朝鲜人民联系在一起。
    我们伟大的领袖列宁和斯大林教导我们，要不倦地提高和保持党和人民对苏维埃国家的敌人阴谋的警惕性。
    现在我们应该更加加强自己的警惕。
    任何人不要以为：苏维埃国家的敌人能够使我们措手不及。
    为了保卫苏维埃祖国，我们英勇的武装部队装备有各种现代化的武器。我们的陆海军战士、军官和将军在伟大的卫国战争中获得了丰富的经验，他们一定会给任何敢于进攻我国的侵略者以应有的迎击。
    我们国家的力量及其不可摧毁性，不仅在于它有着在战斗中锻炼出来的光荣的军队。
    苏维埃国家的强大，还在于苏维埃人民的团结一致和他们对苏维埃社会的领导力量——共产党的信任，在于人民对自己苏维埃政府的信任。共产党和苏维埃政府非常珍贵人民的这种信任。
    苏联人民一致拥护我们党中央委员会、苏联部长会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团关于实施非常重要的决定以保证我国全部生活得到不间断的正确的领导的决议。
    这些重要的决定之一就是任命列宁的天才的学生和斯大林的忠实战友格奥尔基·马克西米利安诺维奇·马林科夫担任苏联部长会议主席。
    我国党和国家的最高机构所通过的这个决议，明显地表现出，对于党和国家的领导是完全团结一致的。
    这种对于国家领导的团结一致，就是顺利实施党和政府多年来在列宁和斯大林领导下所制订的内政、外交政策的保证。
    斯大林也像列宁一样，给我们党和国家留下了伟大的遗产，我们必须像保护眼珠一样地保护它，不倦地丰富它。
    伟大的斯大林培养了许多经过战斗考验并掌握了列宁斯大林领导艺术的领导者，把他们团结在自己周围；他们负有历史性的责任，就是把列宁所创始的、斯大林所胜利地继续进行了的伟大事业进行到最后的胜利。
    我国人民可以相信，苏联共产党和苏联政府将不惜用一切力量和生命来维护党的队伍和党的领导的钢铁一般的统一，巩固苏联各民族间牢不可破的友谊，加强苏维埃国家的威力，始终不渝地忠实于马克思列宁主义的思想，并遵循列宁和斯大林的遗训，将我国从社会主义引导到共产主义。
    我们所热爱的亲爱的领袖和导师、伟大的斯大林永垂不朽！（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科九日电）
