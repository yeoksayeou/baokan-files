To the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party:

    Upon hearing the news of the unfortunate passing of Comrade Klement Gottwald, Chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, we express our deepest condolences to you with utmost sorrow.

    The passing of Comrade Gottwald is not only a loss of a great leader for the Czech people but also a loss of an outstanding fighter for the worldwide camp of peace and democracy.

    We must, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, continue to consolidate and develop the friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia, further consolidate the camp of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union, heighten our vigilance, and fight to the end to defend the cause of world peace and the cause of communism.

                        The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
