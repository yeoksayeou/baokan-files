The Hebei Provincial Party Committee convened a provincial conference on the implementation of the Marriage Law movement from February 2nd to 6th. Attendees included members of the local Party committees, municipal committees, county committees, town committees, and women's committee secretaries. Using criticism and self-criticism, and in light of local conditions and personal thinking, everyone discussed the Central Committee's instructions on implementing the Marriage Law. Through this conference, the attending cadres largely eliminated their vague ideas about implementing the Marriage Law, recognized the importance of implementing the Marriage Law, and unanimously felt that the Central Committee's instructions were very timely and correct. Everyone increased their confidence in doing a good job in this movement. This conference mainly discovered and solved the following problems:

First, the nature, purpose, guiding principles, policies, and requirements of this Marriage Law implementation movement were clarified. The conference criticized and clarified the "leftist" impetuous emotions of many cadres and the right-leaning passive thinking of some cadres. For example, some cadres believed that since the guiding principle of the movement was propaganda and education, the movement could not be carried out thoroughly, and the goal of changing customs could not be achieved. They demanded that the movement be carried out with the energy of the "Three-Anti" campaign and use the power of suppressing counter-revolutionaries to deal with criminals. They advocated that all arranged and mercenary marriages should be registered, the bride price confiscated, and then a decision made on whether to divorce or stay together; all early marriages should be annulled; all widows should remarry; and all those who beat their wives, committed infanticide, or had abortions should be punished by law. The conference criticized this "leftist" harmful view because it would disrupt the movement, deepen the masses' misunderstanding of the Marriage Law, expand family disputes, worsen the relationship between husband and wife, and between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and dampen the masses' enthusiasm for production. Some cadres had right-leaning emotions. They underestimated the level of consciousness of the masses, did not believe in the urgent demand of the broad masses for the implementation of the Marriage Law, and excessively emphasized the contradictions and difficulties between the implementation of the Marriage Law and various tasks. They said: "Since it is a long-term process, let's take our time! Anyway, we can't solve many problems at once." The conference pointed out that this kind of thinking would make the movement slip by lightly and would similarly cause the Party to become divorced from the masses.

Second, some county, district, and village cadres' feudal ideas and illegal and undisciplined behavior in marriage issues were initially exposed. Discussions at the conference revealed that cadres generally had varying degrees of patriarchal rule and feudal ideas of valuing men over women; interfering with freedom of marriage and beating wives were not isolated instances. Some cadres in Leting County said: "Husbands have the right to beat their wives, and women have the obligation to be beaten." In the Luanan County Tax Bureau, 11 out of 31 cadres beat their wives. In Fuping County, when a widow wanted to remarry, a court cadre actually advised her: "A good horse does not have two saddles, and a virtuous woman does not marry twice." Yang Xiuhua, an armed forces department cadre in Fengrun County, interfered with his younger sister's freedom of marriage, locked her in a room, and forced her to commit suicide by jumping into a well; the county party committee only gave him a warning. Hu Junqing, the organization committee member of the Second District Committee of Zhangbei County, in order to find a wife, colluded with the district committee secretary to detain a woman who came to the district to register for marriage, intending to force her to marry him; when the woman refused, she escaped in the dark, and the district committee secretary took four people on horseback to search for her, and then snatched her back to the district and forced her to marry him. As a result, the woman escaped again in the middle of the night, and her whereabouts are unknown. The county committee has not yet dealt with this matter. In response to the above situation, the conference emphasized that the Marriage Law implementation movement must be combined with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, because only by first eliminating the feudal ideas of cadres and seriously dealing with incidents of violations of law and discipline can the smooth progress of the Marriage Law implementation movement be guaranteed.

Third, the entire province's past implementation of the Marriage Law was generally reviewed, and the urgency and necessity of carrying out this movement were recognized. The conference affirmed the three types of implementation of the Marriage Law in Hebei Province (good, average, and bad), but according to the reports at the meeting, the first type was very few in number, and some areas did not even have the first type. In most areas, free marriage was only in its initial stages, and arranged and mercenary marriages, child brides, and early marriages still dominated. In some places, the infanticide of girls was still extremely serious, and incidents of women being killed and committing suicide continued to occur in many places. According to statistics from six counties, Xingtai, Shahe, Lincheng, Renxian, Longyao, and Neiqiu, mercenary marriages and marriages disguised as mercenary marriages accounted for more than 90% of all marriages. Marrying a wife cost at least two million yuan, and as much as one thousand catties of cotton in some cases. Accompanying mercenary marriages was the very chaotic marital relationships in some areas. After review, the attending cadres generally improved their awareness of implementing the Marriage Law and further aroused their enthusiasm for launching this movement.

Fourth, the relationship between the Marriage Law implementation movement and various other tasks and their integration was initially resolved. At the beginning of the conference, many cadres reported that although the higher authorities said that the Marriage Law implementation movement was the central task for March, it could not affect production, Party consolidation, rectification of land cultivation on behalf of others, and literacy campaigns. So how many people would actually be available to carry out the Marriage Law movement? The Dingxian County Committee conducted an investigation in three counties for this purpose, and the conclusion was that each district could only spare four or five people. Therefore, some cadres said: "This is a half-hearted movement." The conference conducted repeated and serious discussions on this issue, and finally unanimously agreed: on the one hand, use the method of "organizing together" to "organize" the county and district cadres responsible for managing production, cultivating land on behalf of others, and implementing the Marriage Law. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, they should be organized into several groups to study relevant policies, go deep into key villages, uniformly arrange various tasks, and concentrate several forces to complete several tasks together, instead of concentrating all forces to complete one task as in the past. The advantage of this is that the leadership force is strong, the work pace is consistent, and a relatively small number of cadres can simultaneously do more work well. On the other hand, rely on grassroots organizations, train grassroots cadres well, and fully implement the mass line of mobilizing and relying on the masses. The conference pointed out that Party committees at all levels must be good at resolving the problem of integrating the Marriage Law implementation movement with various tasks.

Regarding the organizational leadership of the Marriage Law implementation movement, the conference proposed:

First, it is clear that the implementation of the Marriage Law is the central task of the entire Party in March. Party committees at all levels should assign dedicated personnel to take charge, the Party committee should hold regular discussions, and the Party committee secretary and deputy secretary should regularly understand the situation, provide specific guidance, and promptly resolve problems in the movement to ensure the healthy development of the Marriage Law movement. At the same time, attention must be paid to not crowding out production, and production should be promoted and strengthened.

Second, the steps and methods for carrying out this movement: (A) Hold an enlarged conference of county and district cadres before the Spring Festival; after the Spring Festival, start training the main cadres of the villages. On average, three people from each rural village and five people from each urban street will participate in the training for five days. In addition, each county will train 400 to 500 key propagandists, branch instructors, and literacy station heads. The training of street and village cadres must be personally presided over by the county Party committee and must achieve the following three goals: (1) Clarify the nature, purpose, guiding principles, policies, and requirements of implementing the Marriage Law; (2) Draw ideological boundaries; (3) Learn specific methods. Simultaneously with the training of grassroots cadres, cadres in government agencies and the military must spend about ten days studying the Marriage Law before March 1st. (B) After the Marriage Law implementation movement begins, all provincial reporters must give a report to the masses; all cadres who are detached from production must do as much propaganda work on the Marriage Law as possible to the masses and write letters to family members and relatives to promote the Marriage Law; all amateur drama troupes must perform new plays on implementing the Marriage Law; local cultural centers should organize artists to sing and recite drum lyrics promoting the Marriage Law; primary schools and above should learn songs on implementing the Marriage Law; literacy classes and literacy elimination classes should add Marriage Law courses and organize discussions; slideshow teams should show slides promoting the Marriage Law, at least ten times; the provincial newspaper, municipal newspapers, and prefectural farmer newspapers should open special columns to promote the Marriage Law; radio stations should broadcast at least one hour of programs promoting the Marriage Law every day, teach singing songs promoting the Marriage Law, and organize announcers to go to the countryside; mobilize all cinemas and theaters to show and perform films or dramas on implementing the Marriage Law; Party members, Youth League members, propagandists, and propaganda team members should all be mobilized to go door-to-door, company-by-company, and workshop-by-workshop to carry out propaganda. It is essential to make the propaganda known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

Third, in order to ensure the steady development of the movement, it is stipulated that no arrests are allowed without the approval of judicial organs above the county level. All cases that are sentenced to criminal penalties as typical cases must be discussed by the county Party committee. Party committees at all levels must earnestly adhere to the reporting system.

    河北召开全省贯彻婚姻法运动会议
    批判干部错误思想规定开展运动的步骤和方法
    中共河北省委在二月二日到六日召开了全省贯彻婚姻法运动会议。到会的有中共各地委、市委、县委、镇委委员和妇委书记等。大家用批评与自我批评的方法，联系当地情况，联系个人思想，对中央贯彻婚姻法的指示进行了讨论。经过这次会议，到会干部基本上肃清了对贯彻婚姻法的模糊思想，认识到贯彻婚姻法的重要性，一致感到中央的指示是非常适时和正确的，大家都增加了搞好这一运动的信心。这次会议主要发现和解决了以下几个问题：
    第一、明确了这次贯彻婚姻法运动的性质、目的、方针、政策和要求。会议中批判和澄清了许多干部“左”的急躁情绪和部分干部的右倾消极思想。如有的干部认为运动的方针既是宣传教育，就不能把运动搞得彻底，就不能达到移风易俗的目的。他们要求按“三反”的劲头开展运动，用镇压反革命的威力处理人犯。他们主张：对包办买卖的婚姻都要进行登记，没收彩礼，再决定离或合；凡是早婚的都要退婚；凡是寡妇都要改嫁；凡是打骂老婆、溺婴、堕胎的都要受到法律处分。会议批判了这种“左”倾的有害观点。因为这样会把运动搞乱，加深群众对婚姻法的误解，扩大家庭纠纷，恶化夫妇、婆媳之间的关系，打击群众的生产积极性。有些干部则有右倾情绪，他们过低地估计了群众觉悟程度，不相信广大群众对贯彻婚姻法的迫切要求，过分地强调贯彻婚姻法与各种工作的矛盾和困难。他们说：
    “既然是长期的，那就慢慢来吧！反正一下子也解决不了多少问题。”会议指出这种思想会使运动轻轻滑过，同样会使党脱离了群众。
    第二、初步揭发了一些县、区、村干部在婚姻问题上的封建思想和违法乱纪的行为。在会议讨论中反映出：干部中普遍存在着程度不同的夫权统治、重男轻女的封建思想；干涉婚姻自由，打骂老婆等违法乱纪的行为也不是个别的。乐亭县有的干部说：“丈夫有打老婆的权利，妇女有挨打的义务。”滦南县税务局三十一个干部中，有十一个打老婆的。阜平县一个寡妇要改嫁，法院的干部竟劝她说：“好马不备双鞍，烈女不嫁二夫。”丰润县武装部干事杨秀华干涉胞妹婚姻自由，把妹妹锁在屋里，逼得妹妹跳井自杀；而该县县委竟只给以警告处分。张北县二区区委组织委员胡俊卿，为了找老婆，竟串通区委书记把一个到区里登记结婚的妇女扣留下来，要强迫结婚；该妇女不愿意，黑夜逃走，区委书记竟带着四个人骑马前去搜查，又抢回区里，强迫结婚；结果那妇女在半夜又逃走了，下落不明，县委对这件事至今还未处理。针对上述情况，会议强调指出：贯彻婚姻法运动必须和反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争结合起来，因为只有首先肃清干部的封建思想和严肃处理违法乱纪的事件，才能保证贯彻婚姻法运动顺利开展。
    第三、普遍地检查了全省过去执行婚姻法的情况，认识到开展这一运动的迫切与必要。会议肯定了河北省目前执行婚姻法的三种类型（好的，一般的、坏的），但根据会上反映，第一种类型为数很少，有的地区甚至没有第一种类型。在大部分地区里，自由结婚仅仅处于萌芽的阶段，包办、买卖婚姻、童养媳、早婚等现象仍占着优势，有些地方重男轻女的溺婴现象仍极严重，不少地方妇女被杀和自杀事件还不断发生。据邢台、沙河、临城、任县、隆尧、内邱等六个县统计，买卖婚姻和变相买卖婚姻占全部结婚数的百分之九十以上。娶一个媳妇起码要二百万元，多者达一千斤皮棉。随着买卖婚姻而来的是有些地区的婚姻关系非常混乱。经过检查，到会干部普遍提高了贯彻婚姻法的自觉性，进一步激发起对展开这一运动的热情。
    第四、初步解决了贯彻婚姻法运动与其他各种工作的关系及其相互结合的问题。会议开始时，许多干部反映：上级虽说贯彻婚姻法运动是三月份的中心工作，可是又不能影响生产、整党、整顿代耕、扫除文盲等工作，那么究竟还有多少人去开展婚姻法运动呢？定县地委为此还在三个县作了调查，结论是每区只能抽出四、五人。因此有些干部说：“这是半大运动。”会议对这个问题进行了反复认真的讨论，最后一致同意：一方面使用“组织起来”的方法，把管理生产、代耕和贯彻婚姻法等方面的县、区干部“组织起来”，在党委统一领导下编成若干小组，学习有关政策后，深入重点村，统一安排各种工作，集中几种力量共同完成几种任务，而不是像过去那样集中所有力量完成一种任务。这样做的好处是领导力量强大，工作步调一致，以相对数量少的干部，同时作好更多的工作。另一方面是依靠基层组织，训练好基层干部，充分地贯彻发动群众、依靠群众的群众路线的工作方法。会议指出：各级党委必须善于解决贯彻婚姻法运动与各种工作结合的问题。
    关于贯彻婚姻法运动的组织领导问题，会议提出：
    第一、明确贯彻婚姻法是全党三月份的中心工作。各级党委要确定专人掌握，党委会要定期讨论，党委书记、副书记要经常了解情况，作具体指导，及时解决运动中的问题，保证婚姻法运动健康发展。同时必须注意不要挤掉生产，并要推动和加强生产。
    第二、开展这一运动的步骤与方法：（甲）春节前开好县区干部扩大会议；春节后开始训练村的主要干部，参加训练的农村每村平均三人，城市街道平均每街道五人，时间五天。此外，每县训练宣传员骨干、支部教员、传授站长四、五百人。街村干部的训练，必须由县委亲自主持，要达到以下三个目的：（一）明确贯彻婚姻法的性质、目的、方针、政策和要求；（二）划清思想界限；（三）学会具体作法。与训练基层干部同时，机关、部队干部都要在三月一日以前，以十天左右的时间开展婚姻法的学习。（乙）贯彻婚姻法运动开始后，全省报告员都要向群众作一次报告；所有脱离生产的干部都要尽可能地向群众作婚姻法的宣传工作，并向家属和亲友写封宣传婚姻法的信；所有业余剧团，都要出演贯彻婚姻法的新剧；各地文化馆都应组织艺人，说唱宣传婚姻法的鼓词；小学以上学校都要学会贯彻婚姻法的歌子；民校和扫除文盲识字班，都要增加婚姻法课程，并组织讨论；幻灯队要出演宣传婚姻法的灯片，至少演出十次；省报、市报、地委农民报都要辟出专栏宣传婚姻法；广播台每日至少广播一小时的宣传婚姻法的节目，教唱宣传婚姻法的歌曲，并组织收音员下乡；动员一切电影院、剧院放映和出演贯彻婚姻法影片或戏剧；党员、团员、宣传员、宣传队员一齐出动，包户、包社、包车间进行宣传。务使宣传达到家喻户晓，深入人心。
    第三、为了保证运动稳步地发展，规定不经县以上司法机关批准，不准捕人。凡作为典型而判处刑事处分的案件均要经过县委讨论。各级党委都必须认真坚持请示报告制度。（李殿隆）
