Strengthen Specific Leadership over Spring Plowing Production

Judging from the situations in parts of Shandong, Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hebei provinces, the preparations for this year's spring plowing are inadequate; some work is even worse than last year. Now, the spring plowing preparation stage is basically over, and spring plowing production is about to begin. Failure to pay attention to strengthening the leadership of spring plowing production will inevitably cause huge and irreparable losses to the country and the people. Judging from the past and current spring plowing preparation work, there are several issues in spring plowing production work that should be closely monitored and resolved:

    1.  Many local leading cadres have not clearly placed spring plowing production in the primary position of rural work; or they only make empty slogans calling for "all work to be closely integrated with production," but in fact, they regard production as "incidental" work. Many places have too many meetings, and grassroots cadres simply cannot take care of leading production. Some department staff members randomly assign "central tasks" to the masses in rural areas. Some counties arbitrarily convene "ten thousand people meetings" or centralized militia drills. Now, the major administrative regions and provinces have clearly stipulated that spring plowing production is the central work of rural areas. This stipulation is entirely correct. However, how to ensure that spring plowing production truly becomes the central work of rural areas is still a big problem. There are many rural work tasks at present. In addition to spring plowing production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, it is also necessary to implement the Marriage Law, to carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, to carry out the patriotic health campaign, and many places also need to carry out party rectification, political construction, grain requisition, and eliminate illiteracy. Some tasks are given a time limit by the higher authorities and require reports, so lower-level cadres regard these tasks as "hard tasks," while production work is regarded as a "soft task." How can spring plowing production work be done well?

    In order to truly make spring plowing production the central task, leading organs must first strengthen the unified leadership of various departments and various tasks, stop the phenomenon of various departments acting on their own, boasting about themselves, and bumping into each other in rural areas, and rationally utilize the power of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, trade, cooperation, banks, civil affairs and other departments, and determine a unified work plan and personnel deployment around the central task of spring plowing production. All work that conflicts with spring plowing production should be properly arranged under the unified plan of the Party Committee. Those that can be combined should be combined, those that can be postponed should be postponed, and those that can be avoided should be avoided. Cadres who work in rural areas should hold as few large and small meetings as possible and cherish the energy of the masses. Higher-level leading cadres must not only shout empty slogans such as "all work must be combined with the central task," but must explain to the lower levels the methods of integration. Otherwise, leading production will still be regarded as a "soft task" and there is a danger of being "squeezed out."

    2.  Many peasants still have many ideological concerns about developing production. This is because some local cadres do not have a firm grasp of policies or even distort them. The poor preparation for spring plowing in many places is closely related to this situation. In many places in the Southwest, there have been phenomena of infringing on the interests of middle peasants. Some mutual aid groups use middle peasants' cattle without compensation or at low prices, or even convert middle peasants' cattle into public property at low prices for joint raising and use, but do not pay the price for a long time; some people borrow money and food from middle peasants and do not give interest or even repay the principal, no matter how long the time is. Some areas implement joint cattle feeding without any mutual aid basis, and the burden of feeding labor and fodder is unreasonable, resulting in the phenomenon of "fat cattle being fed thin and thin cattle being fed to death." The same situation also exists in East China and Central South. Many mutual aid groups and agricultural producers' cooperatives in Northeast and North China blindly accumulate public property. Some cadres in Heilongjiang proposed: "Without public rubber-tired carts, if people and horses are not together, it cannot be regarded as a permanent mutual aid group." On the one hand, this makes relatively wealthy peasants worry that private property is not guaranteed, and they are unwilling to add livestock and farm tools, and are unwilling to actively expand production; on the other hand, it makes some poorer peasants unable to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations because they cannot afford to pay the shares. In the work of collecting agricultural taxes and mobilizing civilians to participate in winter water conservancy projects, many places have also violated policies and made the burden on peasants unreasonable. These situations are extremely harmful and dangerous, and are a great obstacle to agricultural production. In the recently issued instructions on carrying out the production increase movement and strengthening spring plowing work, various places have generally announced that they will protect the private ownership of land and property of people of all classes, increase production without increasing burdens, and strictly prohibit illegal apportionment and forced labor, which will play a great role in dispelling the ideological concerns of peasants. However, to implement these policies among the masses and greatly improve the production enthusiasm of the masses, it is by no means possible to achieve practical results simply by printing and distributing announcements and holding meetings. It is necessary to do a lot of meticulous and arduous work, mainly to specifically demonstrate the policies to the masses with facts.

    3.  Most areas have trained mutual aid, cooperation, and production backbones in the past winter and this spring, convened representative meetings of labor models, summarized local bumper harvest experiences, formulated regional technical guidance outlines and production increase plans, and issued instructions on carrying out the 1953 patriotic production increase movement, which is necessary. However, from a national perspective, the promotion of advanced experience and technical improvement work is still in the stage of calls and publicity in most areas, and remains in the cadres and a few villages, groups, and cooperatives as pilot projects, and has not yet become the actual action of the masses. In the process of promoting the bumper harvest experience of Zhaoyuan in Northeast China, the principle of using new farming methods to produce more grain was promoted. The masses were very excited after hearing it, but many peasants were unwilling to take concrete actions to prepare more seeds and fertilizers. Why does this happen? The main reason is that the shortcomings of the general leadership style have not been corrected. Many cadres still lack specific and in-depth leadership and inspection, have not helped the masses solve practical difficulties, and have not adopted different methods to carry out work according to different regions and different situations. The Northeast region paid great attention to promoting the leadership methods of the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee, and this situation still occurred. There are more similar situations in other regions. In early March, leading cadres in several counties in the Baoding Special Zone of Hebei still did not know how much land could be sown in the whole county. Seeing some rain and snow in the past winter and this spring, they blindly believed that there was no problem with sowing, so they did not pay attention to leading the masses to prevent and fight drought. In fact, according to surveys, among the 48 villages with the best soil moisture in Wanxian County, there were 110,000 mu of land, of which only 30,000 mu of water was enough for sowing. There are some areas with minor or major or serious crop failures in various places. In general areas, there are still many poor peasants who lack food in the spring. Some areas have already formed spring famine, and there have been phenomena of selling livestock, land, clothes, furniture, and fleeing famine. These phenomena occurred in some counties in Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Sichuan, but the county-level cadres did not know. Every year, all places shout about paying attention to leading agricultural production, especially during the spring plowing period, the shouting is even louder, but there are still very few people who go into it and specifically lead production like Comrade Ren Guodong, Secretary of the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee. All cadres who lead rural work should learn to specifically lead production. Without this, everything is empty.

    Now, the spring rural work inspection teams organized by the CCP committees and people's governments in various places have set off. The inspection team of the Central Ministry of Agriculture is also about to set off. The inspection teams and inspection groups in various places should not only urge grassroots cadres to carry out work when they go to rural areas, but also explain work methods and styles to them, understand the joys and sorrows of the masses, help grassroots cadres and the masses solve practical difficulties, understand the shortcomings in their past work, and improve their leadership accordingly. Spring plowing production is already very urgent. In areas where the inspection team has not arrived, local leading cadres should also quickly and effectively inspect the spring plowing work, discover problems in time, and solve problems. If spring plowing is delayed, the production increase plan will fail, and the completion of the entire national construction plan will be affected. We should seize the spring plowing work, effectively grasp the policies, improve the leadership style, pay attention to work methods, mobilize the production enthusiasm of the vast peasant masses, and strive for the victory of the 1953 patriotic production increase movement!

### 加强对春耕生产的具体领导

    加强对春耕生产的具体领导
    就山东、浙江、湖南、江西、河北等省部分地区的情况看来，今年的春耕准备工作是做得不充分的；有些工作甚至还不如去年。现在，春耕准备阶段基本上已经过去，春耕生产就要开始了。再不注意加强春耕生产的领导，必然要给国家和人民造成不可弥补的巨大损失。从过去和当前的春耕准备工作的情况来看，在春耕生产工作中，有几个问题应当密切注意加以解决：
    一、许多地方的领导干部没有十分明确地把春耕生产放在农村工作的首要地位；或者只是空口号召“一切工作要紧紧结合生产”，事实上却把生产当成了“捎带”的工作。许多地方开会太多，基层干部根本顾不上领导生产。有些部门的工作人员在农村随便给群众布置“中心任务”。有些县随意召开“万人大会”，或集中民兵大会操。现在，各大行政区、各省都已明确规定了春耕生产是农村的中心工作。这样规定是完全正确的。但是，怎样保证春耕生产真正成为农村的中心工作，还是一个大问题。当前农村工作任务是很多的，除了春耕生产和互助合作运动之外，还要贯彻婚姻法，要进行反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争，要开展爱国卫生运动，许多地方还要进行整党、建政、征粮、扫除文盲等工作。有些工作上级限定时间完成，并且要作报告，下级干部就把这些工作看作“硬任务”，而把生产工作看成“软任务”。这怎么能把春耕生产工作做好呢？
    为了把春耕生产真正作为中心任务，领导机关首先要加强对各部门各种工作的统一领导，制止各部门各自为政、自吹自打以致在农村里乱碰头的现象，而把农林、畜牧、贸易、合作、银行、民政等部门的力量合理地运用起来，围绕着春耕生产的中心任务，确定统一的工作计划和人员部署。凡是和春耕生产有矛盾的工作，都应在党委统一计划下作出适当的安排，能结合的就结合，能缓办的就缓办，能不办的就不办。到农村做工作的干部，要尽可能少召开各种大会小会，珍惜群众的精力。上级领导干部决不能仅仅空喊“一切工作要和中心任务相结合”，而必须把结合进行的方法向下级讲清楚。不然，领导生产还是会被当成“软任务”，有被“挤掉”的危险。
    二、许多地区农民群众在发展生产方面仍然存在着不少思想顾虑，这是因为某些地方干部掌握政策不稳，甚至歪曲了政策。不少地方春耕准备工作做得不好，和这种情况有很大关系。西南许多地方发生侵犯中农利益的现象。有些互助组无代价或低价使用中农的耕牛，甚至把中农的耕牛低价折算归公，伙养伙用，但长期不付价款；有些人向中农借钱借粮，不管时间多长，都不给利息，甚至不还本金。有些地区没有一点互助基础，就实行合伙喂牛，喂养人工和草料负担又不合理，结果发生“肥牛喂瘦，瘦牛喂死”的现象。华东、中南各地也有同样的情况。东北、华北不少互助组、农业生产合作社盲目积累公共财产。黑龙江有些地方干部提出：“没有公共胶皮车、人马不在一起不算常年互助组。”这一方面使比较富裕的农民耽心私有财产没有保障，不愿意添置耕畜、农具，不愿意积极扩大生产；一方面使一部分较贫困的农民因为出不起股金而不能参加互助合作组织。在征收农业税、动员民工参加水利冬修等工作中，许多地方也发生了违反政策、使农民负担不合理的现象。这些情况是极其有害极其危险的，是农业生产上的极大的障碍。各地在最近发布的关于开展增产运动、加强春耕工作的指示中，大都明令宣布了保护各阶层人民的土地财产私有权、增产不增负担，严禁违法摊派勒索派工等现象，这对解除农民的思想顾虑会起很大作用。但是，要把这些政策贯彻到群众中去，要把群众的生产积极性大大提高，决不是仅仅印发布告、召开大会就能发生实际效果的，还要作许多细致的艰苦的工作，主要是用事实把政策具体地表现给群众看。
    三、大部地区在去冬今春训练了互助合作和生产的骨干，召开了劳动模范代表会议，总结了当地的丰产经验，制订了地区性的技术指导纲要和增产计划，发布了开展一九五三年爱国增产运动的指示，这是必要的。但是，从全国范围看来，先进经验的推广和技术改进工作，在大部分地区都还停留在号召、宣传的阶段，停留在干部中和少数作为试验点的村、组、社中，还没有变成群众的实际行动。东北各地在推广肇源丰产经验中，宣传了采用新耕作法能多打粮食的道理，群众听了非常兴奋，但是却有许多农民不肯采取具体行动，准备较多的种籽和肥料。为什么会发生这样的情况呢？主要原因是领导作风一般化的缺点仍然没有纠正过来，许多干部还缺乏具体地深入地领导和检查，没有帮助群众解决实际困难，没有分别不同地区和不同情况，采取不同的办法进行工作。东北区十分注意推广肇源县委的领导方法，还发生了这样的情况，其他各地类似的情况就更多了。河北保定专区好几个县的领导干部到三月上旬还不了解全县到底有多少地能够播种，看到去冬今春有些雨雪，就盲目地认为播种没有问题，因之没有注意领导群众防旱抗旱。其实，据调查，完县墒情最好的四十八个村，有十一万亩地，其中只有三万亩的水分够得上播种的需要。各地都有一些或大或小或重或轻的歉收地区，一般地区也都还有不少贫苦农民在春季缺乏口粮，有些地区且已形成春荒，发生了出卖耕畜、土地、衣服、家具和外出逃荒的现象。陕西、山西、四川有些县发生了这些现象，县级干部还不知道。各地每年都喊注意领导农业生产，特别在春耕期间喊得更加响亮，可是，像肇源县委书记任国栋同志那样钻进去具体地领导生产的还是很少。所有领导农村工作的干部都应当学会具体地领导生产。不如此，说什么都是空的。
    现在，各地中共党委和人民政府组织的春季农村工作检查团都已出发了。中央农业部的检查团也即将出发。各地的检查团、检查组到农村去，不只是要督促基层干部进行工作，而且要向他们讲解工作方法和作风，要了解群众的喜怒哀乐，要帮助基层干部和群众解决实际困难，要了解自己过去工作中的缺点，据以改进自己的领导。春耕生产已经非常紧迫了，在检查组没有到的地区，当地领导干部也应赶快切实对春耕工作作一番检查，及时发现问题，解决问题。如果耽误了春耕，就会使增产计划落空，就会影响到整个国家建设计划的完成。我们应当抓紧春耕工作，切实掌握政策，改进领导作风，注意工作方法，把广大农民群众的生产积极性发动起来，争取一九五三年爱国增产运动的胜利！
