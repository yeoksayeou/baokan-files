    We Must Correct the Phenomenon of Stockpiled Goods
    China National Department Store, Beijing Company

    The People's Daily published an article on January 24 criticizing our company for blindly processing and purchasing goods, resulting in a large backlog of commodities and causing significant losses to state funds. We sincerely accept this criticism and have conducted a thorough review. According to our investigation, the main reasons for the above situation are: our insufficient understanding of production and sales, poor management, and the prevalence of a strong supply system mentality among many cadres.

    In terms of processing and ordering, there is a great deal of blindness due to a lack of understanding of production and sales. In the early days of Beijing's liberation, Northeast China and other regions needed a large number of Beijing-produced towels and socks. We processed a large quantity of these. But how much did the Northeast actually need? What were the quantity, specifications, and quality of Beijing's products? We did not understand these basic facts at all. Beijing-produced matches used to have sales markets in the Northwest and North China. In 1951, there was a period of short supply. We lacked investigation and research, so we blindly processed and purchased goods. By the second half of 1952, the Northeast Department Store stated that they no longer wanted Beijing-produced towels and socks, and sales groups sent to various places also ran into snags. Only then did we realize the seriousness of the problem.

    The mentality of cadres in the sales department favoring brand-name goods is also an important reason for the phenomenon of stockpiled goods. The quality and specifications of the "Golden Double Horse" plain men's socks produced in Beijing have been continuously improved and have caught up with the "Wolfdog" socks produced in Shanghai. However, when sales units request goods, they primarily want Shanghai's "Wolfdog" socks and are not interested in "Golden Double Horse" socks. Some stores, even if they have "inferior goods," do not display them fully or place them in inconspicuous places. They believe that promoting brand-name goods does not require explanation, while non-brand-name goods require more explanation. As a result, brand-name goods are in short supply, while non-brand-name goods are seriously stockpiled.

    Our business personnel cannot figure out our assets, are clueless, and do not know what goods are in the warehouse, how much stock there is for each item, and how long they have been stored. Even the responsible cadres of the sales units do not know these basic facts. Frequently, sales procedures have been completed, but there are no goods in the warehouse. Sometimes, when a large transaction is about to be concluded, we do not know the inventory situation and have to run around to check the goods and quantities in the warehouse. The phenomenon of stockpiled goods caused by chaotic inventory systems, discrepancies between accounts and goods, and poor storage is also very serious. This has caused irreparable losses to the state. In addition to making a profound self-criticism, we propose the following improvement measures:

    1.  Strengthen planning in purchasing: In the future, we must formulate processing and ordering plans based on the needs of the people, and regularly hold special research meetings on processing and purchasing (convened by the processing and purchasing department with the participation of sales units and allocation personnel) to study production and sales conditions, and constantly propose ways to improve specifications, improve quality, and reduce costs, so that products can meet the requirements of consumers.

    2.  Establish a correct view of supporting production, and carry out processing and ordering according to the principle of rewarding the advanced, maintaining the intermediate, and eliminating the backward.

    3.  Strengthen investigation and research and specialized management. Department stores have a wide variety of goods and complex categories. In order to have a comprehensive understanding of the goods, determine a specialized management policy, and strengthen specialized research, each salesperson should be assigned according to the goods and systematically understand the situation of the goods they manage.

    4.  Immediately conduct a thorough inventory and sorting, and lay the foundation for future understanding of our assets through inventory and sorting.

    5.  Criticize the mentality of favoring brand-name goods, vigorously promote stockpiled goods, reduce inventory, and distribute stockpiled goods to every sales unit, every sales team, and every salesperson. Make the promotion of stockpiled goods an important task in the production increase and economy practice campaign.

    我们一定要纠正积压商品的现象
    中国百货公司北京市公司
    一月二十四日人民日报刊载了批评我公司盲目加工进货、积压大批商品、使国家资金遭受巨大损失的文章。我们诚恳地接受这个批评，并且进行了深入的检查。据我们检查，造成以上情况的主要原因是：我们对产销情况了解不够，经营管理不善，许多干部存在着浓厚的供给制思想。
    在加工订货上，由于不了解产销情况，盲目性很大。在北京解放初期，东北等地需要大量的北京生产的手巾、袜子。我们就进行了大量的加工。但东北究竟需要多少？北京的产品的数量和规格、质量怎样？这些根本情况都不了解。北京生产的火柴，过去在西北和华北有销售市场。一九五一年曾一度呈现供不应求现象。我们缺乏调查研究，就盲目加工进货。到一九五二年下半年，东北百货公司提出不要北京生产的毛巾、袜子，派往各地的推销小组又碰壁了，这时才感到问题的严重。
    销货部门的干部有名牌货思想，这也是造成商品积压现象的重要原因。北京生产的金双马平口男袜的质量规格，经过不断的改进，已赶上上海生产的狼狗袜子。但是销货单位要货时，首先是要上海狼狗袜子，对于金双马袜子则不感兴趣。有的门市部就是要了“背货”，也不全摆出来，或摆在不显著的地方。他们认为推销名牌货不必解释，非名牌货就要多做解释。结果，名牌货供不应求，非名牌货就严重积压下来了。
    我们的业务人员摸不清家底，心中无数，不知道仓库里究竟有些什么货，每种商品的存量有多少，以及存了多久。甚至销货单位的负责干部也不知道这些基本情况。经常已经办好销货手续，但仓库里无货。有时要成交大宗业务，但不知库存情况，就得东奔西跑地查看仓库内的商品和数量。因库存制度紊乱，账货不符，保管不善而造成的商品积压现象也很严重。这都给国家造成了不可弥补的损失。我们除作深刻的检讨外，并提出如下改进办法：
    一、加强进货计划性：今后必须根据人民需要来制订加工订货计划，定期召开加工进货专题研究会议（由加工采购部门召集销货单位及调拨人员参加），研究产销情况，不断地提出改进规格、提高质量、降低成本的办法，使产品能符合消费者的要求。
    二、树立正确的扶植生产观点，应在奖励先进的、维持中间的、淘汰落后的的方针下来进行加工订货。
    三、加强调查研究及专业经营。百货品种繁多、种类复杂，为了对商品作全面的了解，确定专业经营方针，加强专业研究，使每个业务员都按商品分工，系统地了解自己经营商品的情况。
    四、立即进行彻底清仓排队，通过清仓排队，打下今后弄清家底的基础。
    五、批判名牌货思想，大力推销积压商品，压缩库存，把积压商品分配到每一个销货单位、每一个推销小组和每一个业务员，把推销积压商品列为增产节约竞赛运动中的一项重要任务。
