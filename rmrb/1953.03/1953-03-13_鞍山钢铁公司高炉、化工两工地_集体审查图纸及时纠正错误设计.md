    Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Blast Furnace and Chemical Plant Construction Sites
    Collective Review of Drawings Corrects Design Errors in a Timely Manner

    Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Blast Furnace and Chemical Plant construction sites accepted the experiences and lessons learned from construction last year and implemented a collective drawing review system in this year's construction preparation work, preventing waste in construction due to design errors.

    Before adopting this method of collective drawing review, departments often did not exchange opinions in advance, and errors in the drawings were often discovered only during construction, which greatly affected the quality and progress of the project. For example, during the construction of the No. 8 Blast Furnace last year, one component could not be manufactured because the drawing did not specify the tolerance. Later, when the design department added the tolerance, the production department disagreed with the design department, and the two sides argued inconclusively, affecting the installation by the construction department for two months.

    Learning from last year's lessons, the blast furnace and chemical plant construction sites began this work in early January this year. Units such as construction, production, design, and the technical supervision office participated in the review. Under the direction of the Engineering Management Office, groups were divided into machinery, electrical, civil construction, furnace construction, power, gas, and iron smelting. During the review process, according to the nature of the project, attention was paid to reviewing the manufacturing and processing requirements and construction aspects; whether the machine parts and materials were available and suitable; the coordination of civil engineering and sanitary equipment; and safety operations for the production departments. Before the review, the original designers explained the design data and design purpose, and exchanged opinions based on the issues raised during the review. All of the blast furnace construction site drawings were reviewed in mid-January, and the chemical plant construction site is currently underway because the drawings have not arrived completely. The two construction sites have discovered a total of 496 incorrect drawings. The main errors in the blast furnace construction site drawings are inaccurate or omitted machining symbols, dimensions, and tolerances for machine parts orders. Dimensional errors in the chemical plant construction site drawings account for two-thirds of all drawings. If construction were carried out according to such drawings, the blast furnace construction site's blower circulating water outlet, underground water pipes, and the No. 2 generator circulating water outlet would interfere with each other. In addition, some refractory bricks are missing material composition tables.

    Currently, most of these problems discovered during the review have been studied by the relevant units and resolved after final review. This review has avoided many errors in this year's construction.

### 鞍山钢铁公司高炉、化工两工地  集体审查图纸及时纠正错误设计

    鞍山钢铁公司高炉、化工两工地
    集体审查图纸及时纠正错误设计
    鞍山钢铁公司高炉、化工两工地接受去年施工中的经验教训，在今年施工准备工作中，执行了集体审查图纸的制度，防止了因设计错误而造成施工中的浪费。
    在没有采用这种集体审查图纸的方法以前，由于各部门事先没有交换意见，往往在施工中才发现图纸上面有错误，对工程质量和进度的影响很大。如去年在建筑八高炉的工程中，有一个部件因图纸上没有说明公差数，没有办法制作。后来由设计部门添注公差数时，生产部门又和设计部门的意见不一致，双方争论不决，影响施工部门两个月不能安装。
    接受去年的教训，高炉和化工两个工地从今年一月上旬就开始进行这一工作。参加审查的有施工、生产、设计及技术监督处等单位。由工程管理处主持，分成机械、电气、土木建筑、筑炉、动力、燃气及炼铁等小组。在审查过程中，按工程性质，注意审查制造加工与施工方面的要求；机件材料有没有，是否合适；土建、卫生设备的配合；以及生产部门安全操作等问题。在审查前，由原设计人员说明了设计资料和设计目的，并根据审查中的问题交换意见。现在高炉工地的全部图纸已在一月中旬审查完毕，化工工地因为图纸没有到齐，现在正在进行。两工地前后共发现错误图纸四百九十六张。高炉工地图纸的主要错误，是机件订货的加工符号、尺寸、公差不准确或被遗漏。化工工地图纸在尺寸上的错误占全部图纸的三分之二。如果按照这样的图纸施工，高炉工地的鼓风机循环水出口、水管地下部分与二号发电机循环水口将要互相抵触。此外，有的耐火砖还没有材料成份表。
    现在，审查出来的这些问题，绝大部分已经各有关单位研究，并经过最后的汇审解决了。这次审查使今年的施工避免了许多错误。
