State-owned department store system, after establishing wholesale stations, verifying capital, and beginning to implement the economic accounting system, the majority of employees have gradually realized that the economic accounting system is the most progressive and scientific management method for socialist enterprises. Those who originally lacked confidence in implementing the economic accounting system now have confidence. There is no doubt that, after arduous and conscientious efforts, the superiority of the economic accounting system will inevitably be gradually brought into play, fundamentally changing the face of the state-owned trade management.

However, in the process of promoting the economic accounting system, the state-owned department store system has also encountered many problems, one of the most serious of which is the neglect of market supply work, resulting in the out-of-stock phenomenon of certain commodities. The reason why this problem is so serious is that it has occurred in many regions, and many cadres have not paid due attention to it. Some cadres even mistakenly said: "Commodity shortages are an inevitable phenomenon of implementing the economic accounting system." If this phenomenon cannot be quickly corrected, and if this erroneous argument cannot be given a stern criticism in time, it will not only lose the entire meaning of implementing the economic accounting system, but also affect the leading role of state-owned trade in the market, which is extremely detrimental to the country's economic construction.

The purpose of implementing the economic accounting system in the state-owned trade system is to enable each enterprise unit to use state funds reasonably on the track of the economic accounting system, organize commodity circulation reasonably, and better serve production and people's lives. Therefore, the implementation of the economic accounting system should never affect the market supply; on the contrary, it should improve the market supply work. However, at present, some cadres of enterprise units have not clearly recognized this point. They one-sidedly believe that the implementation of the economic accounting system is only to compress funds and inventory. Of course, it is wrong to accumulate national wealth and waste state funds; but it is also wrong to set the capital too small regardless of the specific situation, not actively purchase goods, resulting in the out-of-stock of certain commodities.

When verifying funds, many enterprise units advocate "rather small than large," and the sales plans they formulate are often too low. When purchasing goods, they like to buy "brand-name goods." They are unwilling to deal with matters realistically according to the needs of local residents, do not take the initiative and enthusiasm in promotion work into account, and do not see the continuous increase in people's living standards. They have adopted this unenthusiastic promotion method and irresponsible attitude towards the market. The reason why they do this is that some lack a correct understanding of the implementation of the economic accounting system, some lack experience, and some are due to laziness, lack of brainpower, and unwillingness to develop the creativity and enthusiasm of promotion work, and want to "complete" and "overfulfill" the plan without effort.

After the reorganization of Nantong Branch of China Department Store Corporation into a wholesale station and a store, it adopted this wrong approach. They knew that some commodities were needed by the market, but they were afraid that the plan would be too large to complete, so the procurement plan they formulated was very low. Among them, the item of local sugar was 10% lower than the already conservative sales plan; the bamboo shell thermos bottles, bicycle inner and outer tires, etc., which were urgently needed by local residents, were not included in the procurement plan at all. If the state-owned commercial system ignores the needs of consumers, does not actively organize the supply of goods, and does not vigorously promote the sales of goods, it will inevitably lead to the result of out-of-stock of certain commodities, which will affect the market supply.

Some units believe that "brand-name goods" are easy to sell and easy to complete the sales plan, so they rush to buy "brand-name goods." For example, Nantong Department Store and the wholesale station signed a supply and marketing contract, but did not strictly implement it. Some fast-selling goods, although not included in the store's purchase plan, must also be purchased; some slow-selling goods, although included in the plan, are refused to be purchased. They do not actively help the wholesale station to promote the sales of goods in stock, and even regard the wholesale station as their own warehouse, adopting the method of daily purchase and sale, purchasing goods from the wholesale station three or four times a day, and the quantity of each purchase is very small. On the other hand, some wholesale stations keep "brand-name goods" for their directly affiliated stores to promote sales, and try their best to push "unsalable" goods to the stores, which is also wrong. A quarter of the shelves in Jinan Department Store were empty before the Spring Festival, and many commodities were out of stock. The Jinan Wholesale Station has more than 300 kinds of commodities needed by local residents in stock, but they are not distributed to the stores. The current actual situation of the production of daily industrial products in our country is that the supply of brand-name goods is relatively small, while the supply of non-brand-name goods is larger; if the sales plan is completely pinned on "brand-name goods," the result will inevitably be empty due to the failure to supply brand-name goods; if stores and wholesale stations rush to buy "brand-name goods" from each other, the situation of out-of-stock of certain commodities in certain regions will become more serious.

From the current facts, the consequences of commodity shortages have not only seriously affected the sales amount of the state-owned department store system and its reputation in the market, but also have had adverse effects on production and people's lives. For example, the sales volume of Wuhan Department Store in January this year decreased by 30% compared with the previous month, and many customers said that the department store was a "shortage company"; in some areas of Northeast China, the attendance rate of employees was affected due to the failure to supply cold-proof articles; the kerosene shortage that once occurred in Hunan Province spread to 14 counties for as long as two months, affecting the needs of the vast number of farmers and also affecting the development of the petroleum industry.

The purpose of implementing the economic accounting system in the state-owned trade system is to use a certain amount of funds given by the state to give play to the creativity and enthusiasm in management within the scope of national policies and unified plans. Therefore, enterprise units that implement the economic accounting system should strive to implement national policies and complete and overfulfill the commodity circulation plan. The basic requirements for implementing the economic accounting system are to expand commodity circulation, accelerate capital turnover, and reduce circulation costs. These three are unified and indivisible, and expanding commodity promotion is the most basic link. Therefore, the idea and practice of simply compressing inventory and capital in order to accelerate capital turnover, regardless of policies, market needs, not actively purchasing goods, not vigorously promoting sales, and only wanting "brand-name goods" without promoting general commodities, and not actively promoting commodities that have been in stock, are all wrong. It must be recognized that state-owned trade serves the vast number of people and production undertakings and must be responsible to the market. Therefore, all employees of state-owned trade should seriously recognize this point: the implementation of the economic accounting system is absolutely not allowed to have any relaxation or negligence in market supply.

Many state-owned trade units are currently carrying out the struggle against bureaucracy and against the supply system's management thinking. At the same time, they must explain, criticize and correct various ideological concerns and wrong practices caused by the implementation of the economic accounting system, give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of employees, and promote advanced experience such as the meeting of salesmen and commodities created by Handan Department Store Wholesale Station, in order to unify understanding, strengthen confidence, clarify the responsibilities of state-owned trade, and resolutely and steadily implement the economic accounting system.

### 国营贸易系统不能因为实行经济核算制而放松推销工作

专栏：经济工作述评

    国营贸易系统不能因为实行经济核算制而放松推销工作
    国营百货公司系统经过建立批发站，核定资金，开始实行经济核算制后，广大职工已逐渐认识到经济核算制是社会主义企业最进步、最科学的管理方法。原来对实行经济核算制缺乏信心的人，现在都有了信心。毫无疑义，经过艰苦、认真的努力，经济核算制的优越性必然要逐步发挥出来，从根本上改变国营贸易经营管理的面貌。
    但是，国营百货公司系统在推行经济核算制的过程中，也发生了很多问题，其中最严重的问题之一，就是忽视市场供应工作，造成了某些商品脱销的现象。这个问题所以十分严重，是因为许多地区都发生了这个问题，而且许多干部对这个问题还没有引起应有的注意。有些干部甚至错误地说：“商品脱销是实行经济核算制必然的现象。”这种现象如果不能迅速纠正，这种错误论调如果不能及时给予严正的批判，则不但失去了实行经济核算制的全部意义，并将影响到国营贸易对市场的领导作用，对国家经济建设是极其不利的。
    国营贸易系统实行经济核算制的目的，是使每一个企业单位，在经济核算制的轨道上，合理地使用国家的资金，合理地组织商品流转，更好地为生产和人民生活服务。因此，实行经济核算制决不应该影响到市场的供应，相反的，更应该把市场供应工作做好。但目前，有些企业单位的干部并没有明确地认识到这一点，他们片面地认为实行经济核算制只是为了压缩资金、压缩库存。当然，积压国家财富，浪费国家资金是不对的；但不顾具体情况，把资金核的很小，不积极进货，结果造成某些商品脱销，也是不对的。
    很多企业单位在核定资金的时候，主张“宁小勿大”，制订的销售计划常常偏低，进货的时候喜欢要“名牌货”。他们不肯实事求是地根据当地居民的需要办事，不把推销工作中的主动性和积极性估计在内，看不到人民生活水平不断增涨的情况，竟采取了这种不积极推销，对市场不负责任的作法。他们所以这样作，有些是对实行经济核算制缺乏正确的认识，有些是缺乏经验，有些是由于懒惰、不动脑筋，不愿发挥推销工作的创造性和积极性，而想不化力气地“完成”和“超额完成”计划。
    中国百货公司南通支公司改组为批发站与商店后，就采取了这种错误的作法。他们明知道有些商品是市场需要的，但怕计划订大了完不成，因此制订的进货计划就很低。其中土糖一项，比原已保守的销售计划还低百分之十；当地居民迫切需要的竹壳热水瓶、自行车内外胎等，根本没有订入进货计划。国营商业系统如果不顾消费者的需要，不积极地组织货源，不大力推销货物，必然要造成某些商品脱销的结果，影响了市场供应。
    有些单位，认为“名牌货”好销，容易完成销售计划，于是抢购“名牌货”。例如南通百货商店与批发站订立了供销合同，但并没有严格执行。有些旺销货物，商店进货计划虽然没有列入，但是也要进货；有些滞销货物，虽已列入了计划，却拒绝进货。他们对于批发站积压的商品，不积极帮助推销，甚至把批发站当作自有仓库，采取日购日销，每天向批发站购货三、四次，每次进货数量都很小的办法。另一方面，有些批发站把“名牌货”留下来给自己直属的门市部推销，把“不好销”的货尽量推给商店，这也是错误的。济南百货商店的货架，在春节前空起四分之一，很多商品脱销了。济南批发站库存三百多种为当地居民需要的商品，却不分配给商店。我国当前日用工业品生产的实际情况是名牌货的供应数量还比较少，非名牌货则较多；如果把销售计划完全寄托在“名牌货”上，结果必然会因名牌货供应不上而落空；如果商店和批发站再互相抢购“名牌货”，某些商品在某些地区脱销的情况就会更加严重。
    从目前的事实来看，商品脱销的后果，不但已严重地影响到国营百货公司系统的卖钱额，影响到它在市场上的信誉，而且对生产和人民生活也造成了不良的影响。例如，武汉市百货公司今年一月份营业额比上月下降了百分之三十，很多顾客说百货公司是“缺货公司”；东北部分地区曾因御寒物品供应不上而影响了职工的出勤率；湖南省一度发生的煤油脱销现象曾遍及十四个县、达两月之久，影响了广大农民的需要，也影响到石油工业的发展。
    国营贸易系统实行经济核算制的目的，是在国家政策和统一计划的范围内，运用国家给予的一定数量的资金，发挥经营上的创造性和积极性，因此，实行经济核算制的企业单位，应为执行国家政策、完成和超额完成商品流转计划而努力。实行经济核算制的基本要求是扩大商品流转、加速资金周转、降低流转费用，这三者是统一的，不可分割的，而扩大商品推销是其中最基本的一环，因此，那种为了加速资金周转而单纯压缩库存、压缩资金，不顾政策、不顾市场需要、不积极进货、不大力推销，以及只要“名牌货”而不推销一般商品，不积极推销已积压的商品的思想和作法都是错误的。必须认识：国营贸易是为广大人民和生产事业服务的，是必须对市场负责的，所以，国营贸易的全体职工应该严肃地认识到这一点：实行经济核算制决不允许对市场供应有任何放松和疏忽。
    很多国营贸易单位目前正在开展反对官僚主义、反对供给制经营思想的斗争，与此同时，必须针对因实行经济核算制而引起的各种思想顾虑和错误作法，予以解释、批判和纠正，发挥职工的积极性和创造性，推广像邯郸百货批发站所创造的销货员与商品见面等先进经验，为统一认识，加强信心，明确国营贸易的职责，坚决地、稳步地贯彻经济核算制而努力。
