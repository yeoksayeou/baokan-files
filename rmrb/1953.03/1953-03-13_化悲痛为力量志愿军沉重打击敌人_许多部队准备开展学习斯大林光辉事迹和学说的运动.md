Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 12th: For three days, from March 7th to 9th, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, comprising various services and units, fighting heroically against the American aggressors on the Korean front, conducted activities in various forms, deeply mourning the passing of the great revolutionary teacher, Comrade Stalin. Most of the intermediate and senior command organs of the front-line combat troops, logistics transport units, and various special forces held solemn memorial meetings. At the meetings, secretaries or members of the Chinese Communist Party committees at all levels reported on Comrade Stalin's life and his infinitely glorious contributions to the cause of human liberation. At the memorial meeting held by a senior command organ of the Volunteer Army, Du Ping, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Volunteer Army, called on all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army to turn grief into strength, heighten vigilance, redouble efforts, and be prepared to give the enemy, who may invade, the most severe blows at any time.

At 6:00 PM (Pyongyang time) on the 9th, when Comrade Stalin's remains were being buried in Moscow, our front-line troops fired guns and cannons to express their condolences. Soldiers in the trenches on the front line stood in silence for five minutes to express their mourning. Many units are preparing to launch a movement to study Stalin's deeds and glorious theories.

In various mourning activities, the heroic Volunteer Army commanders and fighters expressed their extremely strong will to oppose aggression and defend peace. At a memorial meeting of a unit of our army, Cui Qingli, a model Communist Party branch secretary, said: In the future, we must better educate Party members so that every Party member becomes an excellent fighter of the Party, follows the direction indicated by the great teacher Comrade Stalin, and struggles to the end for world peace and the happiness of mankind. Guo Enzhi, a first-class combat hero of the Volunteer Army and staff officer of a certain battalion, said: "Dear Comrade Stalin has passed away, but he will always live in the hearts of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers. In the future, we must better study Stalin's military science, improve our command art, and more heavily strike the American aggressors who are undermining peace!" Cai Jintong, a second-class combat hero of the Volunteer Army and a model member of the Communist Youth League, said: "The death of Comrade Stalin is an immeasurable loss to the Chinese people and the working people of the world. I will study harder, complete all the tasks assigned to me by the people, and strive to become a glorious Communist Party member as soon as possible."

The troops guarding the Yuyinshan front on the eastern front are determined to turn grief into strength and use practical actions to express their iron will to fight to the end to defend the security of the motherland and world peace. Many cadres and soldiers throughout the army, with tears in their eyes, wrote letters of determination expressing their willingness to dedicate everything to the sacred struggle to resist America and aid Korea, strive for merits, strive to join the Communist Party, and strive to obtain glorious titles.

In these sorrowful days, the Volunteer Army soldiers, who are engaged in heroic battles with the American aggressors, have displayed great courage and resourcefulness, and are constantly and heavily striking the enemy. On the heroic Shangganling battlefield, from March 6th to 8th, the Volunteer Army warriors fought repeatedly with the enemy for 33 times on a platoon-sized position, killing and wounding more than 400 enemies. Communist Party member and squad leader Qiu Erlin led three soldiers to repel eight attacks by an enemy platoon to a company on a hilltop position. Later, he and his comrades were wounded, and a company of enemies was charging up again. At this time, he raised the gun in his hand, faced northwest, and swore to Comrade Stalin: We must repel the invading army's attack! Finally, he alone used hand grenades to defeat the enemy's last attack.

On the evening of March 6th, the Volunteer Army soldiers guarding the "Dingzi Mountain," which had caused the American aggressors great suffering, launched an attack on the enemy after hearing the news of Comrade Stalin's death. In the battle, every soldier displayed a high degree of courage and annihilated a platoon of the 11th Company and a squad of the 12th Company of the 31st Regiment of the U.S. 7th Division in one fell swoop.

On the morning of March 9th, eight F-84 enemy aircraft attacked a certain river bridge of ours. The anti-aircraft artillery unit guarding the river bridge immediately launched fierce artillery fire at the enemy aircraft, immediately shooting down two enemy aircraft and damaging four. When the anti-aircraft gunners held a memorial meeting for the death of Comrade Stalin, they placed the wreckage of the enemy aircraft in front of Comrade Stalin's portrait to express their deep condolences for the death of the great revolutionary teacher.

    化悲痛为力量志愿军沉重打击敌人
    许多部队准备开展学习斯大林光辉事迹和学说的运动 【新华社朝鲜前线十二日电】三月七日到九日的三天中，在朝鲜前线英勇打击着美国侵略者的中国人民志愿军各兵种、各部队，纷纷进行各种形式的活动，沉痛追悼伟大革命导师斯大林同志的逝世。前方战斗部队、后勤运输部队以及各特种兵部队的大多数中级和高级指挥机关都举行了隆重的追悼大会。会上各级中国共产党委员会书记或委员报告了斯大林同志的生平事迹和对全人类解放事业的无限光辉的贡献。在志愿军某高级指挥机关举行的追悼会上，志愿军政治部副主任杜平号召志愿军全体指挥员战斗员化悲痛为力量，提高警惕，加倍努力，准备随时给予可能进犯的敌人以最严重的打击。
    九日下午六时（平壤时间）当斯大林同志的遗体在莫斯科安葬的时刻，我军前线部队都鸣枪鸣炮致哀。在火线上坑道里的战士们肃立五分钟表示哀悼。许多部队准备开展学习斯大林事迹和光辉学说的运动。
    在各种追悼活动中，英勇的志愿军指挥员和战斗员们表达了自己无比坚强的反对侵略、保卫和平的意志。在我军某部的一次追悼大会上，模范共产党支部书记崔庆利表示：今后要更好地教育党员，使每一个党员都成为党的优秀的战士，遵循伟大导师斯大林同志指示的方向，为世界的和平与人类的幸福而奋斗到底。志愿军一级战斗英雄、某营参谋长郭恩志说：“亲爱的斯大林同志逝世了，但他永远活在中国人民志愿军战士的心里。今后我们一定更好地学习斯大林的军事科学，提高我们的指挥艺术，更沉重地打击破坏和平的美国侵略者！”志愿军二级战斗英雄、模范青年团员蔡金同说：“斯大林同志的逝世是中国人民和世界劳动人民不可估量的损失，我要更努力地学习，完成人民交给我的一切任务，争取早日成为一个光荣的共产党员。”
    守卫在东线鱼隐山前线的部队决心化悲痛为力量，以实际行动来表示自己为保卫祖国安全和世界和平而奋斗到底的钢铁意志。全军许多干部和战士都含着眼泪，写下了自己愿为神圣的抗美援朝斗争献出一切的决心书，争取立功，争取参加共产党，争取获得光荣称号。
    在这悲痛的日子里，正在与美国侵略者进行着英勇战斗的志愿军战士们，发挥了极大的勇敢和机智，不断地、沉重地打击着敌人。在英雄的上甘岭战场，志愿军勇士们从三月六日到八日的三天中，在一个排的阵地上与敌军反复争夺了三十三次，杀伤了四百多名敌人。共产党员、班长邱尔林带领着三个战士在一个山头阵地上连续打退了敌军一个班到一个连的八次冲锋。后来，他和他的战友负了伤，一个连的敌人又在往上冲，这时，他举起手中的枪面向着西北方向，向斯大林同志宣誓：一定打退侵略军的进攻！终于，他一个人又用手榴弹打垮了敌人的最后一次进攻。
    三月六日晚，守卫在曾经使美国侵略军大吃苦头的“丁字山”上的志愿军战士们，在听到斯大林同志逝世的消息后，向当面的敌人发起了一次攻击。战斗中，每一个战士都发挥了高度的勇敢精神，一举歼灭了美军第七师三十一团十一连的一个排和十二连的一个班。
    三月九日上午，有八架F—84型敌机袭击我某处江桥，守卫江桥的我高射炮部队立即向敌机发出猛烈的炮火，当即击落敌机两架，击伤四架。高射炮手们在举行追悼斯大林同志逝世大会时，便把敌机残骸放在斯大林同志的遗像面前，来表示他们对伟大革命导师逝世的深沉哀悼。
