Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 7th: Moscow workers deeply mourned the death of the wise leader and teacher of the Soviet people, J.V. Stalin. Laboring people in various enterprises and factories held memorial services one after another.

    At the Moscow "Hammer and Sickle" factory, after the unfortunate news spread, half-mast flags were hung on the roofs of all workshops to express mourning, and all workers in the factory felt indescribable grief, because the most precious, bright, and joyful things in the lives of the metallurgists of this factory were connected with the name of Stalin. During the First Five-Year Plan, under the guidance of the great leader, they rebuilt the factory, making the technology more perfect and constructing spacious workshops. Inspired by dear Stalin, the factory's steelworkers smelted the first batch of steel for the motherland, and the rolling mill workers rolled out the first batch of high-quality shaped steel. On the 6th, a memorial service was held in the factory. Old technician I. Durtanov first spoke, saying: Comrade Stalin is as dear to us as the motherland, as dear as our Party! The Soviet people, in difficulties and battles, have advanced and achieved victory with the slogan "For the Motherland, for Stalin!" Today we shout this slogan again. We must unite more closely around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Let our steel be used to strengthen our motherland and glorify the brilliant image of the great leader! Youth League member I. Kolokolkov said: It was he, our father, Stalin, who educated us and endowed us with the excellent qualities of Soviet people. Stalin, we swear to you that we will never let down this lofty title of Soviet people. Great Lenin-Stalin Party, we swear to you that we are ready to accept any test for the victory of communism!
    The entire history of the famous Moscow Automobile Factory is also inseparable from the name of the great Stalin. The workers of the Moscow Automobile Factory preserve three congratulatory messages from Stalin to them, and they regard these messages as sacred mementos. Among these three congratulatory messages, one was to celebrate the opening of the factory, one was to thank the factory for its great help to the Soviet army during the Great Patriotic War, and one was to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the factory's founding. At the memorial service held by thousands of workers of the automobile factory, technician Shevchenko said: We can hardly imagine that our beloved leader is no longer with us, but the powerful and heroic Lenin-Stalin Party—the wisdom, honor, and conscience of our era—still exists. Shevchenko called on the workers of the automobile factory to unite more closely around the Communist Party and the Soviet government and to work harder to fight for peace and build communism in the Soviet Union.
    At the "Red Proletarian" Lathe Factory, several thousand workers, engineers, technicians, and staff held a memorial service in the large building of the mechanical workshop. Hundreds of workers in this factory still remember that during the First Five-Year Plan period, according to Stalin's order, spacious and bright new workshop buildings with modern equipment were built on the site of a dilapidated small repair shop. This factory has become an advanced enterprise in the Soviet lathe manufacturing industry. One of the oldest technicians in the factory, Yefim Bakanichev, has worked in this factory for nearly forty years. During the years of Stalin's Five-Year Plan, he personally witnessed the tremendous changes that took place in the factory and in the entire life of the Soviet country. He said at the meeting: Stalin is the creator of our happiness. After Lenin's death, Comrade Stalin swore to unswervingly fulfill Lenin's will. This oath has now been realized. Lathe innovator Serzoya said: The serious loss will never weaken the strength of the Soviet people. The path we are taking is correct, and no one can make us leave this path. We must do our best to build communism, which dear Stalin encouraged us to build.
    At the meeting of all members of the "Dynamo" factory, the elderly workers recounted the scene of welcoming Stalin to the factory on November 7, 1924. At that time, the factory produced in a semi-handicraft way, and only a few tram engines could be produced each month. At that time, Stalin spoke the words in the hearts of the "Dynamo" factory workers and the workers of the whole country—to make the country's industry rise in a straight line. Now, the "Dynamo" factory is one of the factories that manufacture high-efficiency machines for the great communist construction projects. The workers of the "Dynamo" factory emotionally praised the great Stalin. They swore to contribute all their strength to the construction of communism.
    Memorial services were also held in various workshops of the Moscow's large textile integrated factory "Three Mountains" Textile Mill. The participants in the memorial service passed a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in which they expressed their determination—to unite more closely around the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, mobilize all their forces to fight for the great cause of building communism in the Soviet Union, and complete the Fifth Stalin Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule with greater efforts.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 8th: The Soviet Academy of Sciences held a conference to mourn J.V. Stalin. Black紗 was draped in the Academy of Sciences' white marble hall. In the center of the hall was a statue of the dear leader and teacher, the master of science, J.V. Stalin, surrounded by red flags with black borders.

    The President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, A. Nesmeyanov, announced the opening of the memorial service. He said: Stalin has left us. His heart, filled with love for all working people and the oppressed, has stopped beating, and his sharp eyes, which foresaw the destiny of the world, have closed. Our love for Comrade Stalin, our loyalty to his teachings, requires each of us to be more vigilant in our posts, better fulfill our responsibilities, and do our best to advance the cause of Lenin and Stalin. Let us unite more closely around the Party Central Committee and the Soviet government. Stalin is dead, but his cause lives on and will be victorious!
    Academician V. Vinogradov then spoke. He talked about Comrade Stalin's brilliant work "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," which opened up a new era for the development of social sciences. He said: Stalin was the first to explain the social nature of language in a very profound analysis, to explain the position of language in other social phenomena, and to point out the path for the further development of advanced materialist science. Academician Vinogradov called on all scientists to tirelessly strive to realize Stalin's testament—to make Soviet science occupy the first place in the world.
    Academician A. Topchiev said: Soviet scientists will never forget Comrade Stalin's instruction that science cannot be separated from the people but is ready to serve the people, and hand over all scientific achievements to the people. It should not be forced to serve the people, but should be consciously and voluntarily. Stalin's name will forever live in the hearts and actions of generations. His great example will forever inspire us to fight for the complete victory of the immortal cause of Lenin and Stalin.
    Academicians T. Lysenko, D. Skobeltsyn, A. Oparin, M. Dubinin, N. Tsizin and corresponding academicians P. Yudin, and A. Pankratova also delivered speeches at the meeting.
    Professor Qian Sanqiang, the representative of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' delegation to the Soviet Union, was invited to deliver an emotional speech at the meeting.
    The participants of the memorial service passed a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, assuring the Central Committee that they would, together with the entire Soviet people, steadfastly follow the policies prescribed by the Communist Party.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 8th: Soviet writers held a conference on the morning of the 6th to mourn Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.

    Nikolai Tikhonov was the first to speak at the meeting. He said that today is a day of grief for the people of our country. Our beloved leader, teacher and friend has passed away. He led the people of the world to happiness and led them to overcome all difficulties victoriously. All the victories achieved by the Soviet people are inseparable from the name of Stalin. The name of Stalin is precious to all mankind. The name of Stalin is immortal.
    Ilya Ehrenburg said: Stalin steered the ship of our country through stormy waves, encouraged us, gave us confidence and strength, managed to defeat the enemies of mankind, managed to maintain peace, and made our country the greatest power. No, such a person will never die! He lives among our people. He lives among all progressive mankind. He will always be with us: with the workers, with the collective farmers, with the soldiers on the border of our motherland, and with the writers at the writing desks. Stalin will live among billions of people.
    Alexander Fadeyev said: The great geniuses of mankind, Lenin and Stalin, established the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Those characteristics that have become the characteristics of the Soviet people are most profoundly embodied in the advanced forces of the people—the members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. They are such people, they clearly see their goals, they move forward bravely in battle, overcome all obstacles and difficulties, and strive to achieve their goals. They are sincerely dedicated to the people, care about the welfare of the people, and love the people. In these very painful days, all the people closely unite their ranks around the Communist Party and the Party Central Committee. The Soviet people swear to work tirelessly to complete the cause left by Stalin—building communism.
    Ukrainian writer Alexander Kornechuk, Latvian writer Vilis Lācis, Dagestani writer Rasul Gamzatov, and Moscow female writer Anna Karavaeva spoke in succession. They talked about the deep sorrow of the Soviet people and their determination to concentrate all their strength on building communism in the Soviet Union.
    Konstantin Simonov and other poets recited poems mourning Stalin.
    The conference unanimously passed a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which stated: "The great Stalin called writers 'engineers of human souls.' He armed them with a deep understanding of the tasks of socialist art and with the method of socialist realism. We, Soviet writers, are faithful to Stalin's testament. We assure the Communist Party, the Party Central Committee, and the Soviet government that we will continue to dedicate all our strength to the Soviet people for the great cause of building communism."

    苏联工人、科学家和作家举行追悼会
    宣誓为实现斯大林遗训而奋斗
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科工人沉痛追悼苏联人民英明的领袖和导师约·维·斯大林的逝世。各个企业和工厂的劳动人民纷纷举行了追悼会。
    在莫斯科“锤子与镰刀”工厂，当不幸的消息传出之后，各个车间的屋顶上都挂上半旗志哀，全厂的工人莫不感到难以描述的哀痛。因为这个工厂的冶金工人的生活中最珍贵、光明、愉快的东西都是和斯大林的名字联系着的。他们在第一个五年计划年间，按照伟大的领袖的指示改建了工厂，使技术变得更为完善，建筑了宽敞的车间。在亲爱的斯大林的鼓舞下，工厂的炼钢工人炼出了祖国的第一批钢，轧钢工人轧出了第一批优质型钢。六日那一天，厂内举行了追悼会。老技师伊·杜尔坦诺夫首先发言说：斯大林同志在我们心中就像祖国、就像我们的党一样地亲切！苏联人民在困难与战斗中曾高呼“为祖国，为斯大林！”的口号前进并取得了胜利，今天我们又高呼这一口号了。我们要更紧密地团结在苏联共产党和苏联共产党中央委员会的周围。让我们的钢被用来加强我们祖国和歌颂伟大领袖的光辉形象吧！青年团员伊·科洛尔科夫说：是他，我们的父亲、斯大林教育我们，使我们具有苏维埃人的优秀品质。斯大林，我们向你宣誓，我们决不辜负苏维埃人这个崇高的称号。伟大的列宁—斯大林的党，我们向你宣誓，为了共产主义的胜利我们准备接受任何考验！
    有名的莫斯科汽车工厂的整个历史也是和伟大的斯大林的名字分不开的。莫斯科汽车工厂的工人保存有斯大林给他们的三个贺词，他们把这些贺词看成神圣的纪念物。在这三个贺词中，有一个是庆贺工厂开工的，一个是感谢工厂在伟大卫国战争期间对苏军的伟大帮助的，一个是庆贺工厂建厂二十五周年的。在数千名汽车工厂的工人举行的追悼会上，技工谢夫诚科说：我们简直难以想像我们敬爱的领袖不再和我们在一起了，然而强大和英雄的列宁、斯大林的党——我们时代的智慧、荣誉和良心——依然存在。谢夫诚科号召汽车工厂的工人更加紧密地团结在共产党和苏联政府周围，更加努力为争取和平及在苏联建设共产主义而斗争。
    在“红色无产者”车床制造厂，好几千名工人、工程师、技术员和职员在机械车间的大房子里举行追悼会。这个工厂好几百工人都还记得，在第一个五年计划的期间里，按照斯大林的命令，在原来是
    一个破烂的小修理厂的地点上，修建起宽大光亮的、拥有现代装备的新车间厂房。这个工厂成了苏联车床制造业的先进企业。工厂最老的技工之一叶菲巴卡尼且夫，他在这个工厂工作了将近四十年。在斯大林五年计划的年代里，他亲眼看到了工厂和苏维埃国家的全部生活所发生的巨大变化。他在会上说：斯大林是我们幸福的创造者。列宁逝世以后，斯大林同志曾经宣誓要不屈不挠地完成列宁的遗嘱。这个誓言现在已经实现了。旋工革新者塞尔佐雅发言说：严重的损失决不会削弱苏联人民的力量。我们走的道路是正确的，没有人能使我们离开这条道路。我们一定要用全力来建设共产主义，亲爱的斯大林就曾鼓舞我们去进行这个建设。
    在“狄纳莫”工厂全体人员的集会上，老年工人追述了他们在一九二四年十一月七日那一天欢迎斯大林到厂里来的情形。那时，工厂用半手工业的方式生产，每月只能出数台电车发动机。那时，斯大林说出了“狄纳莫”工厂工人的和全国工人心里的话——要使国家的工业直线上升。现在，“狄纳莫”工厂已经是替伟大的共产主义建设工程制造高效率的机器的工厂之一了。“狄纳莫”工厂的工人感情洋溢地歌颂伟大的斯大林。他们宣誓要为建设共产主义贡献出全部力量。
    莫斯科巨大的纺织联合工厂“三山”纺织厂的各个车间也举行了追悼会。参加追悼会的人通过了给苏联共产党中央委员会的信，他们在信中表示了自己的决心——要更紧密地团结在共产党中央委员会和苏联政府的周围，动员所有的力量来为苏联建设共产主义的伟大的事业而奋斗，用更大的力量提前完成第五个斯大林五年计划。
        【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科八日讯：苏联科学院举行了追悼约·维·斯大林的大会。科学院的白色大理石的大厅中垂下了黑纱。大厅中央是亲爱的领袖和导师、科学大师约·维·斯大林的巨像，像的周围是镶了黑边的红旗。
    苏联科学院院长亚·涅斯米扬诺夫宣布追悼会开幕。他说：斯大林离开我们了。他那充满了对一切劳动人民和被压迫者的热爱的心停止了跳动，他那预见世界命运的锐利的眼睛阖起来了。我们对于斯大林同志的爱，对于他的训示的忠诚，要求我们每个人在自己的岗位上更加警觉，更好地履行自己的职责，并竭尽全力来推进列宁和斯大林的事业。让我们更加紧密地团结到党中央委员会和苏联政府的周围。斯大林死了，但是他的事业还活着，并且将获得胜利！
    维·维诺格拉多夫院士接着发言。他谈到为社会科学的发展开辟了新纪元的斯大林同志的天才著作“马克思主义与语言学问题”。他说：斯大林最先以非常深刻的分析阐释了语言的社会性质，阐释了语言在其他社会现象中的地位，并指出了先进的唯物主义科学进一步发展的道路。维诺格拉多夫院士号召所有科学家不倦地为实现斯大林的遗训——使苏联科学占居世界第一位——而奋斗。
    亚·托普切夫院士说：苏联科学家永远不会忘记斯大林同志的指示，就是：科学不能脱离人民而是准备为人民服务，并将一切科学成果交给人民，它为人民服务不应是被迫的，而应该是自觉自愿的。斯大林的名字将永远活在世世代代的人们的心中和行动中。他的伟大的范例将永远鼓舞我们为列宁和斯大林的不朽事业的完全胜利而奋斗。
    科学院院士特·李森科、德·斯科贝尔琴、亚·奥巴林、米·杜比宁、尼·齐津和通讯院士帕·尤金、安·潘克拉托娃也在会上发表了演说。
    中国科学院访苏代表团代表钱三强教授应邀在会上发表了动情的演说。

    在会上首先讲话的是尼古拉·吉洪诺夫。他说，今天是我国人民的悲痛的日子，我们敬爱的领袖、导师和朋友逝世了。他领导全世界人民走向幸福，领导他们胜利地克服一切困难。苏联人民所取得的一切胜利，都是和斯大林的名字分不开的。斯大林的名字对全人类都是珍贵的。斯大林的名字是永垂不朽的。
    伊利亚·爱伦堡说：斯大林驾着我们国家这只船穿过惊涛骇浪，鼓舞我们，给我们信心和力量，设法打败了人类的敌人，设法维护了和平并使我国成了最伟大的强国。不，这样的人决不会死！他活在我国人民中间。他活在全体进步人类中间。他将永远和我们在一起：和工人，和集体农民，和我们祖国边境上的战士，和写字台边的作家在一起。斯大林将活在亿万人民中间。
    亚历山大·法捷耶夫说：人类的伟大天才列宁和斯大林建立了苏联共产党。已成为苏联人民的特性的那些特征，在人民的先进力量——苏联共产党党员们的身上最深刻地体现出来。他们是这样的人，他们清楚地看到自己的目标，他们在战斗中勇往直前，克服一切障碍和困难，为达到目标而奋斗。他们为人民而忠诚献身，关心人民的福利，并且热爱人民。在这非常沉痛的日子里，全体人民把他们的队伍紧密地团结在共产党和党中央委员会的周围。苏联人民誓愿不遗余力地工作，来完成斯大林所遗留下来的事业——建设共产主义。
    乌克兰作家亚历山大·考涅楚克，拉脱维亚作家维利斯·拉西斯，达吉斯坦作家拉苏尔·加姆查托夫，莫斯科女作家安娜·卡拉瓦耶娃相继发言。他们讲到苏联人民的深沉的哀痛和他们集中一切力量在苏联建设共产主义的决心。
