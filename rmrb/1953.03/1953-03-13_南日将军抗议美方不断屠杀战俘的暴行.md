Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 12th: On March 7th, the US side conducted a large-scale massacre of our captured personnel at the Yongcho Island POW camp, killing 23 and wounding 42. On March 5th and March 6th, the US side killed two of our captured personnel at the Pongam Island and Geoje Island POW camps. General Nam Il, chief representative of our delegation to the Korean armistice talks, lodged a serious protest with the other side on March 11th regarding the continuous atrocities of the US side in slaughtering POWs. General Nam Il pointed out: Since December 4, 1952, when the Seventh UN General Assembly passed the illegal resolution on the Korean issue based on the Indian proposal for the purpose of detaining POWs, the US side has intensified its persecution and killing of our captured personnel in every possible way, killing and wounding 371 people. The US side and all those who support the US's policy of aggression must bear full responsibility for this bloody fact. The full text of General Nam Il's protest is as follows: Lieutenant General Harrison, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Armistice Negotiation Delegation:

	On March 7th, your side carried out a large-scale bloody massacre of our captured personnel at the Yongcho Island POW camp, killing 23 and wounding 42. Prior to this, on March 5th and March 6th, your side killed two of our captured personnel at the Pongam Island and Geoje Island POW camps. I lodge a serious protest with your side regarding your continuous bestial acts of slaughtering prisoners of war. In order to create an excuse for detaining POWs and forcibly handing them over to the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs to serve as cannon fodder for your so-called "Asians fighting Asians," your side has long adopted all barbaric means to threaten and persecute our captured personnel, and even carried out inhuman collective massacres of our captured personnel. Since the start of the armistice negotiations alone, according to the extremely incomplete figures that your side has been forced to publicly acknowledge, your side has killed and wounded 3,289 of our captured personnel. Your side has cowardly and shamelessly failed to provide an explanation for our repeated protests. Since the Seventh UN General Assembly passed the illegal resolution on the Korean issue based on the Indian proposal for the purpose of detaining POWs, your side has intensified its persecution and killing of our captured personnel in every possible way, attempting to accelerate the realization of your so-called "Asians fighting Asians" scheme to expand the Korean War. On December 14, 1952, your side created a large-scale bloody massacre at the Pongam Island POW camp, and your side launched continuous massacre incidents in POW camps across various locations. On March 7th, your side carried out an even greater massacre at the Yongcho Island POW camp, killing and wounding 65 of our captured personnel. Since December 4, 1952, your side has killed and wounded 371 of our captured personnel. This bloody fact completely exposes the despicable essence of the illegal resolution passed by the UN General Assembly based on the Indian proposal. However, the firm will of our captured personnel to resist forced detention, resist serving as your cannon fodder, and demand repatriation can never be extinguished by your barbaric and bloody persecution. The bloodstained hands of the executioners who massacre POWs can never be concealed or washed away by your shameless silence and the illegal resolutions of the UN General Assembly. Your so-called "Asians fighting Asians" scheme is doomed to a shameful failure. Any attempt by your side to expand the Korean War will inevitably be met with a crushing blow. And your side and all those who support your policy of aggression will never escape the grave responsibility for all these war crimes.

    南日将军抗议美方不断屠杀战俘的暴行
   【新华社开城十二日电】三月七日，美方在龙草岛战俘营大规模屠杀我方被俘人员，打死二十三人，打伤四十二人。三月五日和三月六日，美方在蜂岩岛和巨济岛战俘营打死我方被俘人员两人。朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军，对美方连续不断地屠杀战俘的野兽行为，在三月十一日向对方提出严重抗议。南日将军指出：从一九五二年十二月四日，七届联合国大会根据印度提案通过以扣留战俘为目的的关于朝鲜问题的非法决议以来，美方变本加厉地百般迫害、虐杀我方被俘人员，打死、打伤三百七十一人。美方和一切支持美方侵略政策者对于这一血腥事实必须担负完全责任。南日将军的抗议全文如下：联合国军停战谈判代表团首席代表哈利逊中将：
    三月七日，你方在龙草岛战俘营大规模血腥屠杀我方被俘人员，打死二十三人，打伤四十二人。在此以前，三月五日和三月六日，你方在蜂岩岛和巨济岛战俘营打死我方被俘人员二人。对于你方连续不断地屠杀战俘的野兽行为，我向你方提出严重抗议。为了制造扣留战俘的借口，强迫扣留战俘交给李承晚、蒋介石匪帮，充当你方所谓“亚洲人打亚洲人”的炮灰，你方长时期以来采取了一切野蛮的手段，威胁、迫害我方被俘人员，乃至于对我方被俘人员进行灭绝人性的集体屠杀。仅自停战谈判开始以来，根据你方被迫公开承认的极不完全的数字，你方已经打死打伤三千二百八十九名我方被俘人员。你方对于我方历次提出的抗议卑怯无耻地不作交代。而自从第七届联合国大会根据印度提案通过以扣留战俘为目的的关于朝鲜问题的非法决议案以来，你方更变本加厉地百般迫害、虐杀我方被俘人员，企图加紧实现你方所谓“亚洲人打亚洲人”的扩大朝鲜战争的阴谋。一九五二年十二月十四日，你方在蜂岩岛战俘营制造了大规模屠杀血案，你方在各地战俘营展开了连续不断的屠杀事件。三月七日，你方更在龙草岛战俘营进行了杀伤我方被俘人员六十五名的大屠杀。自一九五二年十二月四日以来，你方已经打死打伤三百七十一名我方被俘人员。这一血腥事实彻底揭露了联大根据印度提案所通过的非法决议的可耻的实质。但我方被俘人员反抗强迫扣留，反抗充当你方炮灰，要求遣返回家的坚决意志，决非你方野蛮血腥的迫害所能磨灭，屠杀战俘的刽子手满手染着的鲜血，决非你方无耻的沉默和联合国大会的非法决议所能掩盖与洗刷。你方所谓“亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋，注定要遭到可耻的失败。你方任何扩大朝鲜战争的企图，将必然遭到粉碎性的打击。而你方与一切支持你方侵略政策者，将永远不能逃脱这一切战争罪行的严重责任。
            朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军
            停战谈判代表团首席代表南日将军
                              一九五三年三月十一日
