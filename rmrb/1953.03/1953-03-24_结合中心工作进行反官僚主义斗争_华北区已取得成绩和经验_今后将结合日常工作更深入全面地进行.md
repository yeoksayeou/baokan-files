Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: The anti-bureaucracy struggle in the entire North China region has achieved results and experience. Based on this foundation, it will be conducted more deeply and comprehensively in combination with daily work. The anti-bureaucracy struggle in the region began in the second half of last year, building on the "Three-Anti" movement, and starting with the handling of the "Zhang Shunyou Incident." During this period, the characteristics of the anti-bureaucracy struggle were: adopting a top-down approach, starting with examining and handling letters from the people, and combining it with the central tasks of various periods and departments. The focus of the struggle was mainly directed at bureaucratic phenomena such as not listening to or irresponsibly dealing with the people's concerns, intentionally or unintentionally suppressing democracy, and being careless, negligent, and complacent. In the financial and industrial systems, the struggle focused on phenomena such as blind operation, not relying on workers and staff, disregarding safety and hygiene, resulting in a large waste of state manpower and resources. All localities have achieved considerable success in carrying out this struggle, exposing and solving many problems, and eliminating some bad people and bad deeds. According to statistics from Tianjin's financial departments alone, 900 major problems were identified in the anti-bureaucracy struggle. In the anti-bureaucracy struggle in Hebei Province, the leaders of several enterprises were exposed for being extremely irresponsible for state assets, the so-called "four unknowns" (unknowing the situation of cadres, the amount of funds, profit and loss, and the amount of inventory), thereby overcoming the supply system mentality to a certain extent and promoting the work of asset verification and improved management.

Because the anti-bureaucracy struggle was carried out on the basis of broadly promoting democracy, it greatly increased the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people. Last August, the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in Linfen County, Shanxi Province, closely combined with the anti-bureaucracy struggle, received 2,492 proposals, of which 337 were related to exposing bureaucratic errors. At the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in Dingxiang County, the representatives used the presence or absence of bureaucratic habits and behaviors as one of the criteria for identifying cadres and electing state workers. After the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, under the personal leadership of Lin Tie, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, correctly handled the "Taidi Village Incident" in Yi County, the people were extremely inspired and actively exposed bad people and bad deeds, so the anti-bureaucracy, anti-commandism, and anti-violation of law and discipline struggles in Hebei Province appeared vigorous and particularly powerful.

The experience of the North China region in carrying out the anti-bureaucracy struggle for the past six months proves that in order to achieve the expected results, the leadership must focus on the following links: First, effectively eliminate the lack of concern for the people's suffering, blind complacency in work, and sectarian attitude towards the cadres they lead in some party and government leading organs and leading personnel. One of the effective ways to eliminate this phenomenon is for higher-level organs to start with examining and handling letters and visits from the people, discover problems, thoroughly investigate and deal with them, and at the same time, use certain meetings, circulars, and other methods to arouse the attention of relevant departments. Those who have committed serious bureaucratic errors must be punished. Second, use the method of typical handling as a demonstration. For example, after the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China handled the "Zhang Shunyou Incident" with great fanfare, the provinces and cities in North China mostly adopted the method of typical handling, so that the anti-bureaucracy struggle could be carried out on a large scale. Third, we must fully promote democracy and combine top-down inspection and supervision with bottom-up criticism. Experience has proven that protecting the rights of the broad masses to accuse and expose, and severely punishing those who retaliate and frame others, is the key to whether the anti-bureaucracy struggle can be carried out in a sound manner.

At present, the anti-bureaucracy struggle in the North China region has been carried out on a certain scale, but the development is uneven. The phenomena of coercion and violation of law and discipline existing in many grass-roots party and government organizations have not been sufficiently exposed and dealt with. Some leading departments and leading cadres have not paid due attention to such serious phenomena. To this end, the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions to local party committees in early March, requiring all levels of leading personnel and all personnel of leading organs to first seriously study the instructions and relevant documents of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and then formulate plans for inspection and implementation in light of the specific conditions of their regions and units. In the inspection, different priorities should be determined in different regions and departments. For example, in rural areas where party consolidation has not been carried out, propaganda and education should be carried out in conjunction with spring plowing production, general elections, and other work, and local phenomena of coercion and violation of law and discipline in local work should be criticized to improve current work; in rural areas where no responsible cadres are leading, only propaganda is allowed, and no action is allowed. In rural areas where party consolidation is being carried out, opposing commandism, especially opposing violation of law and discipline, should be regarded as the most important and prominent content of party consolidation. In the industrial and mining enterprise system, we should focus on inspecting errors such as ignoring rationalization proposals from workers and staff, not caring about the safety and welfare of workers, and causing losses to state property due to irresponsibility. In all leading organs at and above the county level, we should focus on whether they understand the situation below, understand the suffering of the masses, pay attention to letters from the people, have bureaucracy, and whether they harbor and condone bad people and bad deeds. The instructions especially emphasized that party committees at all levels must lead and support bottom-up criticism, and any bad elements who dare to retaliate against critics and block higher authorities and resist inspection must be severely punished; however, personnel who do not understand or have wrong understandings should be distinguished from the above-mentioned bad elements, focusing on criticism and education, and not simply dealing with them. In areas and units where anti-bureaucracy, anti-commandism, and anti-violation of law and discipline struggles have been effectively carried out, we should do a good job in establishing regular and sound democratic life, systematically conducting ideological education, and diligently inspecting work.

    结合中心工作进行反官僚主义斗争
    华北区已取得成绩和经验
    今后将结合日常工作更深入全面地进行
    【新华社二十三日讯】华北全区的反官僚主义斗争已取得成绩和经验，在这个基础上，将结合日常工作，更深入、全面地进行。全区的反官僚主义斗争从去年下半年开始，在“三反”运动的基础上，以处理“张顺有事件”为开端。在此期间，反官僚主义斗争的特点是：由上而下采用了从检查处理人民来信入手的方法，并结合各个时期、各部门的中心工作进行。斗争锋芒主要是向着不倾听或不负责任地对待群众的反映，有意无意地压制民主以及马马虎虎、麻痹自满等官僚主义现象。在财经工矿系统，集中地向盲目经营、不依靠职工群众、漠视安全卫生以致大量浪费国家人力财力等现象作斗争。各地在开展这一斗争中，都取得了相当成绩，暴露了和解决了很多问题，清除了一部分坏人坏事。仅据天津财经部门统计，在反官僚主义斗争中，检查出较重大的问题达九百件。河北省在反官僚主义斗争中，揭发了若干企业单位的领导人对国家资财极度不负责的所谓“四不知”（不知干部情况、不知资金数目、不知赔赚盈亏、不知库存多少）的现象，从而在一定程度上克服了供给制思想，推动了清产核资和改善经营管理的工作。
    由于反官僚主义斗争是在广泛发扬民主的基础上开展起来的，就大大地提高了广大人民的积极性。去年八月，山西省临汾县各界人民代表会议，由于紧密地结合了反官僚主义斗争，收到提案二千四百九十二件，其中属于揭发官僚主义错误的即有三百三十七件。定襄县各界人民代表会议上，代表们把有无官僚主义习气和行为，作为鉴别干部和选举国家工作人员的标准之一。中共河北省委员会在省委书记林铁亲自主持下，正确地处理了易县“台底村事件”后，人民群众极为振奋，纷纷起来揭发坏人坏事，因而河北省的反官僚主义、反命令主义和反违法乱纪的斗争显得生气勃勃，特别有力。
    华北区半年来开展反对官僚主义斗争的经验证明：要使这一斗争获得预期的效果，领导方面必须抓紧以下几个环节：第一，切实清除某些党政领导机关及领导人员不关心群众疾苦、对工作盲目自满以及对所领导的干部的宗派主义态度。扫除这种现象的有效办法之一，即是上级机关从检查处理人民来信、来访入手，发现问题，予以彻查处理，同时以一定的会议、通报等方式，唤起有关部门的注意。对那些犯有严重官僚主义错误的分子，必须加以议处。第二，运用典型处理的方法作为示范。如中共中央华北局大张旗鼓地处理“张顺有事件”后，华北各省、市大都采用了典型处理的方法，使反官僚主义斗争得以大规模地展开。第三，必须充分发扬民主，把由上而下的检查督促与开展自下而上的批评结合起来。经验证明：保护广大群众控诉、揭发的权利和严惩施行报复陷害的分子，是反官僚主义斗争能否健全开展起来的关键。
    目前，华北地区反官僚主义虽已有一定规模的开展，但发展是不平衡的。许多党政基层组织中存在着的强迫命令和违法乱纪现象，揭发和处理都还做得很不够。若干领导部门和领导干部对此类严重现象，有的还未引起应有的注意。为此，中共中央华北局在三月初曾向各地党委发出指示，要求各级领导人员和领导机关的全体人员，首先要认真学习中共中央的指示和有关文件，然后结合本地区、本单位的具体情况，作出检查和执行的计划。在检查中，应在不同地区、不同部门确定不同的重点。如在未进行整党的农村，应结合春耕生产、普选及其他工作，进行宣传教育，联系批判当地工作中的强迫命令和违法乱纪现象，以改进当前工作；在没有负责干部领导时，只准宣传，不准动手处理。在进行整党的农村，则应将反对命令主义特别是反对违法乱纪，作为整党的最主要最突出的内容。在工矿企业系统中，要着重检查漠视职工合理化建议，不关心工人的安全福利以及由于不负责任给国家财产造成的损失等错误行为。在县和县以上的一切领导机关，则应以是否了解下情、了解群众疾苦，是否重视人民来信，有无文牍主义以及对坏人坏事包庇纵容的宗派主义等作为检查重点。指示特别强调各级党委必须领导和支持自下而上的批评，对于任何敢于对批评者施行打击报复和封锁上级、抗拒检查的坏分子，必须予以严厉处分；但对于认识不够或认识错误的人员，应与上述坏分子区别开来，着重批评教育，不可简单从事。在已经有效地进行了反对官僚主义、反对强迫命令和反对违法乱纪斗争的地区和单位，应做好建立经常健全的民主生活，系统地进行思想教育和对工作勤加检查等三项工作。
