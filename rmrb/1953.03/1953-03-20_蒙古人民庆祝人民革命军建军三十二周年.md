Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator: The Mongolian people celebrated the 32nd anniversary of the founding of their People's Revolutionary Army on the 18th, according to TASS.

The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army has traversed a glorious combat path in the past thirty-two years. The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army, created and nurtured by Sukhbaatar and Choibalsan, with the help of the Soviet army, drove foreign interventionists from its own territory.

Now, it is defending the peaceful labor of the Mongolian people in building socialism.

On the 32nd anniversary of the founding of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army, reports, lectures, and symposiums were held in various enterprises, government organizations, schools, and troops. Many glorious veterans of the Mongolian army gave reports at lectures or report meetings. Grand rallies were held in various military organs and troops. The Red Corners of various units decorated window displays with the themes of "The Combat Path of the People's Revolutionary Army" and "The People's Revolutionary Army Standing on the Post of Peace." The Political Department of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army held a large exhibition in the "Officers' House" in Ulan Bator illustrating the heroic struggle, path and cooperation of the Mongolian and Soviet armies. On the 17th, the Ministry of National Defense and representatives of party, government, and social organizations in the capital jointly held a celebration meeting in the "Officers' House" in Ulan Bator. All those present stood in silence to mourn Comrade Stalin, the leader of the working people of the world, and Comrade Gottwald, the outstanding activist of the international workers' movement and leader of the Czechoslovak people.
