    The supplementary instructions of the CCP Central Committee on the Marriage Law Implementation Movement Month have repeatedly pointed out the significance of adhering to the educational approach in this movement and have clearly indicated the specific ways to adhere to the educational approach. The purpose of the CCP Central Committee in issuing supplementary instructions is: on the one hand, it is necessary to educate cadres and the masses, understand the true meaning of the Marriage Law and the benefits of implementing the Marriage Law, so as to correctly implement and abide by the provisions of the Marriage Law on a conscious basis, and no longer violate the Marriage Law; on the other hand, it is necessary to enable cadres to understand the purpose, requirements, and specific practices of the Movement Month to ensure that the movement can be carried out correctly and effectively.

    Since the issuance of the supplementary instructions of the CCP Central Committee, cadres in various localities have generally improved their understanding of the nature, principles, policies, and specific practices of this Marriage Law implementation movement, and have been able to arrange their work in accordance with the spirit of the central supplementary instructions, basically overcoming the once widespread impatience. The movement in individual regions has even shown a healthy and vigorous development trend.

    However, some cadres, due to their failure to seriously understand the spirit of the central supplementary instructions, have developed a sense of "slackening" towards the movement in certain aspects. There are two situations: one situation is that some people do not understand why it is necessary to adhere to the educational approach in implementing the Marriage Law, and why it is necessary to emphasize not conducting universal inspections, and not involving general family relationships and male-female relationships. They believe that "merely carrying out propaganda will not hit the key points of the existing marriage problems," "it will not enable those who have made mistakes to be properly rectified in the movement," therefore, after reading the central supplementary instructions, they mistakenly developed a sense of "slackening." This emotion is essentially another manifestation of impatience. People with this emotion only see the seriousness of the current unreasonable marriage problems, but do not see that the emergence of these problems is the evil consequence of the feudal society left over for thousands of years. It has only been a little over three years since the national liberation, and many cadres and the masses have not yet clearly distinguished between the feudal marriage system and the new democratic marriage system in their thinking. If universal inspections are carried out and past events are investigated, it will not only trap the strength and time in some specific affairs disputes, but will inevitably cause social chaos and affect the current more important central work. Therefore, the central government's proposal to adhere to the educational approach is completely correct. Only by carrying out propaganda and education from a positive perspective, so that everyone can correctly handle their own marriage problems or correctly solve marriage problems for others on a conscious basis, will bad things not continue to happen or happen less often in the future. Therefore, it is wrong for these comrades to only make a one-sided understanding of the policy stipulated in the supplementary instructions of the CCP Central Committee, fail to understand its spirit, and thus produce a "slackening" emotion.

    Another situation is that some people have no determination to carry out the Marriage Law implementation movement at all, and believe that publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law will definitely disrupt society and hinder the central work. After the release of the central supplementary instructions, they have even more "reasons" to believe that the movement does not need to be carried out vigorously, just "publicize" it. As a result, some places attempt to deal with the work of the Marriage Law Implementation Movement Month in a perfunctory manner; some places have even withdrawn the cadres sent to carry out the Marriage Law work; and even individual areas do not take active measures to correct certain deviations that have occurred in the Marriage Law implementation movement, but prepare to end it by passively stopping the movement. Although the above situations are few in number, their ideas and practices are all wrong. Many key experimental areas that have mastered the correct work principles and work methods and have closely integrated the propaganda and implementation of the Marriage Law movement with production have many examples proving that the Marriage Law implementation movement has not caused chaos or hindered production and other central work, but has instead played a role in improving family relations and promoting production. Therefore, the negative and conservative thinking that fear that carrying out the Marriage Law propaganda movement will cause "great chaos in the world" is also wrong.

    At present, although there are very few people who adopt an attitude of confrontation towards the propaganda and implementation of the Marriage Law movement, this phenomenon still exists. Some people with feudal remnants in their thinking express disapproval of the promotion of equality between men and women. They believe that men and women should be unequal, and that it is a matter of course for husbands to beat their wives and is not considered a violation of the law. Therefore, some cadres even sympathize with certain feudal "husband power" ideas of abusing women among the masses. Even a few relatively responsible cadres said when studying the Marriage Law: Implementing the Marriage Law is "raising the status of women," and insisted on this view, believing that there is "nothing big" about having this kind of thinking. In order to correctly publicize and implement the Marriage Law and achieve the expected results, it is necessary to first correct the thinking of the cadres and achieve consensus in the ideological understanding of the cadres. Therefore, we must earnestly implement the work stipulated in the central supplementary instructions, organizing cadres at the county, district, and township levels to earnestly study the Marriage Law and marriage policies. Enable them to understand the spirit of the policy and correctly lead this movement.

    There are also some people who take an indifferent attitude towards the propaganda and implementation of the Marriage Law, believing that they "have neither marriage problems nor divorce problems, and the propaganda and implementation of the Marriage Law has nothing to do with me." This attitude is also wrong. As a state worker, everyone has the responsibility to publicize the state's policies and laws to the masses, help others understand the Marriage Law, so that others will not make mistakes when dealing with marriage problems in the future. In short, the several incorrect ideas and attitudes mentioned above are all inconsistent with the spirit of the supplementary instructions of the CCP Central Committee. Correcting this phenomenon is the most important issue in the Marriage Law implementation movement at present. We must correctly understand and resolutely implement the supplementary instructions of the CCP Central Committee on the Marriage Law Implementation Movement Month, and carry out the propaganda and implementation of the Marriage Law movement to the end.

### 坚决贯彻中共中央关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示

    坚决贯彻中共中央关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示
    中华全国民主妇女联合会秘书长　章蕴
    中共中央关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示，曾一再指出这一运动之所以必须坚持教育的方针的意义，并明确指出了坚持教育方针的具体作法。中共中央发布补充指示的目的在于：一方面一定要使干部和群众受到教育，懂得婚姻法的真实意义和贯彻婚姻法的好处，从而在自觉的基础上正确地去执行和遵守婚姻法的规定，不再违犯婚姻法；另一方面，一定要使干部了解运动月的目的、要求和具体作法，以保证运动能够正确而有力地开展。
    自中共中央补充指示发布后，各地干部对这次贯彻婚姻法运动的性质、方针、政策和具体作法，一般地都提高了认识，能按中央补充指示的精神去安排工作，基本上克服了一度相当普遍的急躁情绪，个别地区的运动并呈现出健康而蓬勃发展的趋势。
    但是，还有一部分干部，由于没有认真地领会中央补充指示的精神，因而在某些方面又产生了一种对运动“松劲”的情绪。这有两种情况：一种情况是，有些人不了解贯彻婚姻法为什么要坚持教育的方针，为什么要强调不普遍检查，不涉及一般的家庭关系和男女关系。他们认为：“仅仅进行宣传，就一定打不中目前存在婚姻问题的要害”，“不能使犯错误的人在运动中好好地被整一整”，因此，他们看了中央的补充指示以后，就错误地产生了“松劲”情绪。而这种情绪实质上仍是急躁情绪的另一种表现形式。有这种情绪的人，只看到目前存在的不合理的婚姻问题严重性的一面，而没有看到这些问题的产生是几千年来封建社会遗留下来的恶果。全国解放仅仅三年多时间，很多干部和群众在思想上还划不清封建婚姻制度和新民主主义婚姻制度的界限。如果普遍检查，追究往事，不仅会把力量和时间陷在一些具体的事务的纠纷中，而且必然会引起社会上的混乱，影响当前更重要的中心工作。因此，中央提出的坚持教育的方针是完全正确的。只有从积极方面进行宣传教育，使大家在自觉的基础上，能够正确地处理自己的婚姻问题或正确地为别人解决婚姻问题，今后的坏事才不会继续发生或少发生。所以，这些同志对中共中央补充指示所规定的方针只作片面的认识，不领会它的精神，因而产生“松劲”情绪是不对的。
    另一种情况是，有些人根本没有决心开展贯彻婚姻法运动，认为宣传贯彻婚姻法，一定会把社会搞乱，会妨碍中心工作。中央补充指示发布后，他们更有了“理由”，认为运动不必费力气大搞了，只
    “宣传”一下就行了。于是有的地方对于贯彻婚姻法运动月的工作，企图潦草了事；有的地方将派去进行贯彻婚姻法工作的干部也抽调回去；甚至个别地区在贯彻婚姻法运动中发生了若干偏差，也不采取积极办法进行纠正，而准备以消极地停止运动的办法来收场。上述情况虽然是为数不多，但他们的想法和作法都是不对的。许多掌握了正确的工作方针和工作方法，把宣传贯彻婚姻法运动与生产密切结合的重点试验地区已有不少事例证明：贯彻婚姻法运动不但没有引起混乱或妨碍生产及其他中心工作，相反地起了改善家庭关系、推动生产的作用。因此，那种怕开展宣传婚姻法运动会引起“天下大乱”的消极保守思想也是错误的。
    目前，对宣传贯彻婚姻法运动采取对抗态度的虽然很少，但这种现象仍然是存在的。有些存在有封建残余思想的人，对提倡男女平等这一点表示不服气。他们认为男女应该是不平等的，丈夫打老婆是天经地义的事，不算犯法。因此，有些干部甚至同情群众中某些虐待妇女的封建“夫权”思想。甚至有个别的比较负责的干部在学习婚姻法时，还说：贯彻婚姻法是“抬高了妇女”，并坚持这种意见，认为有这种思想“没有什么大不了”。为了正确宣传贯彻婚姻法，并能获得预期的效果，必须首先端正干部的思想，使干部在思想认识上求得一致。因此，我们必须认真地执行中央补充指示所规定的，组织县、区、乡三级干部认真学习婚姻法和婚姻政策的工作。使他们领会政策的精神，正确地去领导这个运动。
    也还有一部分人，对宣传贯彻婚姻法采取漠不关心的态度，他们认为自己“既没有结婚问题，也没有离婚问题，宣传贯彻婚姻法与我无关”，这种态度同样是不对的。作为一个国家工作人员，人人有责任向群众宣传国家的政策法令，帮助别人懂得婚姻法，使别人今后处理婚姻问题时再不会犯错误。总之，上面谈到的几种不正确的思想和态度，都是和中共中央补充指示的精神不相符的。针对这种现象，加以纠正，是目前贯彻婚姻法运动中最重要的问题，我们必须正确认识并坚决贯彻中共中央关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示，把宣传贯彻婚姻法运动圆满地进行到底。
