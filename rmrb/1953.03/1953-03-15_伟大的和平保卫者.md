    Great Defender of Peace
    Soviet Union  Ilya Ehrenburg
    In these difficult days, we clearly see the great image of Stalin, we see him walking on the earth, overlooking our turbulent times. He walked through the mountains of his homeland, Georgia, through the battlefields between the Don and the Volga, through the wide streets of Moscow; he walked for a long time on the crowded streets of Shanghai, through the mountains of France, through the forests of Brazil, through the squares of Rome, through the villages of India; he walked on the spine of the century.
    In Paris, on the eve of Stalin's funeral, an unemployed man came to the image of Stalin surrounded by roses, and placed a small bunch of violets next to it, saying: "I didn't buy bread, I bought flowers for him"... The machines of Turin stopped running, the farmers of Sicily stood silently, the dockworkers of Genoa stopped working: they also followed behind Stalin's coffin, they also wept for him. In ancient Beijing, young people, old people, women holding children hurried through the narrow streets to the square to mourn their friend. On the Argentine pampas, a shepherd said "condolences" to a passerby, and the passerby stopped to mourn Stalin with him. In the ruins of Korea, mothers who had fully experienced the bitterness of humanity lowered their heads to mourn Stalin. Warsaw, building on the ruins, hung black gauze on her scaffolding. In New York, upright people, surrounded by police, spies, and thugs, said sadly: "A friend of peace has passed away."
    Our enemies thought that the great loss we suffered would make us feel isolated. Indeed, our loss is too great, it is difficult for us to express in words. Those contemptible people who are accustomed to estimating things with money will never understand what it means to lose such a person. But in these difficult days, we have seen—perhaps for the first time—how many friends we have: our loss has become the loss of mankind.
    A Brazilian farmer finds it difficult to imagine what the streets of Moscow look like, difficult to imagine the face of our rural life; he has never met a Russian, he has never seen snow, he does not know what a sanatorium is. Just as in many centuries ago, he works from morning to night, and his only pleasures are very limited. However, like every working people, he has a great heart, and this heart is engraved with the language about a person who lives at the other extreme of the world, who hopes that all mankind will be happy. This thin, dark-skinned farmer knows that Moscow exists, knows that Stalin lives in Moscow. This knowledge helps him live, helps him stand up straight.
    There are some precious and rare books, containing the last letters of executed Italian and French communists. In those years of fighting fascism, the heroes who fell into the hands of executioners bravely faced death. Some of them managed to write a few short lines to their wives, or to their mothers, or to a friend at the last moment. What did they write? They wrote about their relatives, their children, their homeland, and they also wrote about the person who supported them while they were waiting for death: they wrote about Stalin. Rebe, who had been tortured beyond recognition by the secret police, still mentioned Stalin's name an hour before his execution. Gabriel Péri and Danielle Casanova greeted death chanting Stalin's name. The Chinese heroes who participated in the Long March, the martyrs of Guangzhou who sacrificed for the independence of their motherland, all chanted Stalin's name. The Spaniards who first entered the fight against fascism, fighting against overwhelming odds, swore in the name of Stalin. Stalin supported the suffering Thälmann, Stalin brought hope to Vietnam.
    The people not only listened to him, respected him, but also sincerely loved him; they loved him because he loved the people, he knew their weaknesses and strengths, he understood the tears of a mother who had lost her son in the war, he understood the work of a miner and a bricklayer. His words penetrated the heart of everyone—whether they were in Moscow, Guangzhou, or in Paris, Rio de Janeiro. He took root in our history, in the land we love, and at the same time he is often in the thoughts of people far beyond our borders.
    When fascism threatened the survival of culture, threatened human dignity and human life, Stalin led the army of freedom. He commanded the army and saved the people of Europe and Asia. He also commanded another army, an army composed of heroes from enslaved countries, partisans from Limousin, Piedmont, Poland, and Slovakia, and heroic sons and daughters from Prague and Oslo, Athens and Tirana. Because the people had Stalin's leadership in the war, they were able to win the pride of victory. When the doors of fascist prisons and concentration camps were opened, the people of Europe chanted Stalin's name with tears of joy. On his seventieth birthday, Joseph Vissarionovich received various precious gifts: mothers who had lost their children sent him family heirlooms: a hat of a daughter who had been tortured to death by the secret police, a medal of a son who had sacrificed in the war. The French people sent a bottle of soil from Mont Valérien to Stalin: there, patriots were shot, there, dying heroes shouted motherland, life, and Stalin.
    He was a great general, he hated war; he knew deeply what a disaster war was for ordinary people. He commanded an army that fought for peace during the war years, an army that swore to destroy the instigators of terrible massacres on the ruins of Stalingrad. Everyone knows who cast a cloud over the people's victory, who brought up war again. We can never forget the shadow that fell on Stalin's face when the new cries of bloodshed first came from across the ocean.
    Stalin said: war can be prevented by the people of all nationalities and ordinary people of all countries, and so, an unprecedented army of peace arose. A young woman lay on the tracks to stop a train transporting troops, another woman ran to the playground to plead with the soldiers not to raise their guns against their brothers. Dockworkers crossed their arms and refused to load and unload the aggressor's weapons. Farmers protected their fields and would not let them become foreign airfields. People came to the streets to demand peace, grand gatherings were held, and people representing different nationalities, different viewpoints and beliefs swore to defend peace at such conferences. Hundreds of millions of ordinary people signed declarations that were like oaths. Never in history has there been such a stirring of conscience, such a great hope.
    In these difficult days, peace fighters, no matter where they live, no matter what their views, understand how they should be grateful to Stalin. It was he who helped the people prevent a new war, it was he who saved millions of children and thousands of cities.
    A large square in Rome was crowded with people. Torches illuminated Stalin's image, and the cry of "Stalin is peace" resounded throughout the square, lasting for a long time. In a small town in Mississippi, a black worker said to me: "They want to drive us to slaughter, but Stalin will not allow it." In Denmark, an ordinary woman with five children kept saying: "I am not afraid of them, because there is Stalin in the world."
    In the Chinese countryside, I saw a portrait of Stalin. The Chinese pointed to the portrait and said: "He protects my house." On the walls of a house in Paris, two words, they merge together in people's hearts: "Stalin", "Peace".
    True, there are many people in the army of peace who are communists, just as there were many people in the army that saved humanity from fascist enslavement who were communists. But it is not only communists who defend peace. At various meetings, people with extremely different beliefs, such as the Archbishop of Canterbury Johnson, Abbot Boulier, former German Chancellor Wirth, and Italian Liberal Nitti all spoke of Stalin's wisdom and love for peace. Flying to Moscow to attend the funeral of this great peace fighter were: Indian Congress Party member Ketchillu, French progressive leaders Yves Farge and Pierre Cot, and Italian Socialist leader Pietro Nenni. The attempts of the enemies of mankind to isolate the communists from other peace fighters are in vain. Their plans to isolate the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries from other forces in Western Europe, the Americas, and Asia that are defending the cause of peace are also in vain. Stalin's words that different systems and different worlds can coexist peacefully on the earth have made a deep impression in the hearts of mankind. These words unite the people of all countries and form a force that no despicable warmonger can defeat.
    Stalin repeatedly talked about the independent rights of the people of all countries. Now, the people of all countries know that without independence, there is no security. In the struggle against hidden or open occupation, against foreign bases being established to engage in new aggression, and various different "foreign legions", they have been encouraged by Stalin's words.
    In answering questions from American reporters in late December last year, Stalin pointed out: it cannot be considered that a war between the United States and the Soviet Union is inevitable, and our two countries can coexist peacefully in the future. These are Stalin's last words, which have spread throughout the world. These are the words of the leader of the most powerful country and the most peace-loving country. Stalin protects the ordinary people of the world, against bloodshed, striving for peace.
    When men and women heard the news of the death of the great peace fighter, wherever they lived, their grief is easy to understand. But the people all know: Stalin will not die.
    He lives not only in his writings, not only in the growth and development of the Soviet state; he also lives in the hearts of millions of people, Russians, Chinese, Poles, Germans, French, Vietnamese, Italians, Brazilians, Koreans and Americans. When Stalin's heart stopped beating, grief made the hearts of mankind beat faster; ordinary people felt closer to each other, they understood: people's remembrance of Stalin, Stalin's legacy, and the struggle for peace and human happiness, unite them more closely together.
    Before Stalin's coffin we heard these words: "We are faithful servants of the people, the people want peace and hate war. Therefore, the people's desire—not to let millions of people bleed, to ensure the peaceful construction of a happy life—is sacred to all of us!" These words are Comrade Stalin's thoughts, his goals of concern, his will. These words were spoken from the mouth of his comrades-in-arms, the head of the Soviet government. These words will be passed into the hearts of all ordinary people, and they will say with us: "Stalin is still alive."
    Stalin was strong because he understood the thoughts and feelings of millions of people, he expressed their hopes, their desire for happiness, their longing for peace. In these difficult days, children play as usual, bricklayers stand on scaffolding as usual, and where the sun is warmer, people are farming. Ordinary people are alive, and Stalin lives in their hearts. Although this grief, this loss is unbearable for us, we know that the people of all countries will implement Stalin's legacy, and the people of all countries will defend peace.

    伟大的和平保卫者
    苏联  伊里亚·爱伦堡
    在这些困难的日子里，我们清晰地看到斯大林的伟大的形象，我们看见他在地球上行走，俯瞰着我们的动荡的时世。他走过他的故乡格鲁吉亚的群山，走过顿河与伏尔加河之间的战场，走过莫斯科的宽阔的大街；他长久地行走在上海的拥挤的街道上，走过法兰西的群山，走过巴西的森林，走过罗马的广场，走过印度的村庄；他行走在世纪的脊梁上。
    在巴黎，在斯大林丧礼的前夕，一个失业者来到围绕着玫瑰的斯大林画像前面，在它旁边放下一小束紫罗兰，他说：“我没有买面包，我为他买了花”……都灵的机器停止运转了，西西里的农民静静地站立着，热那亚的码头工人停止了工作：他们也跟着斯大林的灵柩后面，他们也为他而痛哭。在古老的北京，青年人、老年人、抱着孩子的妇女匆忙地走过狭窄的街道，到广场去哀悼他们的朋友。在阿根廷的草原上，一个牧童向一个过路的人说了一声“致哀”，过路的人就停下来和他一道哀悼斯大林。在朝鲜的废墟中，已经充分经历了人类的辛酸的母亲们低下头来哀悼斯大林。在废墟上从事建设的华沙，在她的建筑架上挂上了黑纱。在纽约，正直的人们在警察、间谍和打手的包围中间悲痛地说：“和平的朋友逝世了。”
    我们的敌人以为我们遭受的巨大损失会使我们感到孤立。诚然，我们的损失太大了，我们很难用言语表达。惯于用钱来估计事物的可鄙的人们永远不会懂得，失掉这样的一个人意味着什么。但是在这些困难的日子里，我们已经看见了——也许还是第一次——我们的朋友有多少：我们的损失已经成为人类的损失。
    一个巴西的农民很难想像莫斯科街道的模样，很难想像我们乡村生活的面貌；他从来没有遇见过俄罗斯人，他从来没有看见过雪，他不知道什么叫做休养所。正如在许多世纪以前一样，他从早工作到晚，仅有的乐趣也很有限。但是，像每一个劳动人民一样，他有一颗伟大的心，这颗心上刻着关于一个人的语言，这个人居住在世界的另一极端，这个人希望全人类都得到幸福。这个瘦削的、黑皮肤的农民知道有莫斯科存在，知道斯大林住在莫斯科。这种知识帮助他生活下去，帮助他挺起胸膛。
    有一些珍贵难得的书籍，载有被处死的意大利和法国共产党员的遗书。在和法西斯主义斗争的那些年代中，落入刽子手的手中的英雄们勇敢地迎接了死亡。其中有一些在最后的时刻设法写了短短的几行字给他们的妻子，或给他们的母亲或给一个朋友。他们写什么呢？写到他们的亲人，他们的孩子，他们的祖国，他们也写到在他们等候死亡的期间支持他们的人：他们写到斯大林。被秘密警察折磨得不成样子的雷贝尔在临刑前一点钟还提到斯大林的名字。加布里埃·佩里和丹尼勒·加桑诺瓦念着斯大林的名字迎接死亡。参加长征的中国英雄们，为他们祖国的独立而牺牲的广州的烈士们，都念着斯大林的名字。首先进入以寡敌众的反法西斯斗争的西班牙人以斯大林的名字宣誓。斯大林支持了痛苦中的台尔曼，斯大林给越南带来了希望。
    人民不但听他的话，尊敬他，而且衷心地爱他；他们爱他，因为他爱人民，他熟知他们的弱点和力量，他懂得在战争中丧失了儿子的母亲的眼泪，他懂得一个矿工和砌砖工人的工作。他的话深入每一个人的心——不论他们是在莫斯科、广州，或是在巴黎、里约热内卢。他在我们的历史中，在我们所爱的土地上生了根，同时他也经常在远在我们国境以外的人民的思念之中。
    当法西斯主义威胁文化的生存、威胁人类的尊严和人类的生命的时候，斯大林率领着自由大军。他指挥着军队，拯救了欧洲和亚洲的各国人民。他同时也指挥着另外一支大军，一支由被奴役的各国的英雄，利穆西、皮德蒙、波兰、斯洛伐克的游击队，布拉格和奥斯陆，雅典和地拉那的英雄儿女组成的大军。由于人们在战争中有斯大林的领导，他们才能够赢得胜利的骄傲。当法西斯监狱和集中营的门被打开时，欧洲各国的人民都带着欢乐的眼泪念着斯大林的名字。在他七十岁寿辰时，约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇收到了各种珍贵的礼物：丧失了孩子的母亲们把传家的纪念物送给他：被秘密警察磨折至死的一个女儿的一顶帽子，在战争中牺牲的一个儿子的奖章。法国人民送一瓶瓦勒里安堡的泥土给斯大林：在那里，爱国者被枪杀，在那里，濒死的英雄们高呼着祖国、生命和斯大林。
    他是一个伟大的将领，他痛恨战争；他深知战争对普通的人是怎样的一个灾难。他指挥着一支大军，这支大军在战争年代中为和平而战斗，这支大军对着斯大林格勒的废墟宣誓要消灭可怕的屠杀的煽动者。每个人都知道是谁在人民的胜利之上罩上乌云的，是谁又重新提到战争的。我们永远不能忘记当海洋彼岸第一次传来新的流血的叫嚣时，落在斯大林脸上的阴影。
    斯大林说：战争是可以靠各族人民和各国普通人民来防止的，于是，一支空前的和平大军起来了。有一个小女子躺在铁轨上使一列运输军队的火车停驶，另外一个妇女跑到操场上去恳求士兵们不要举起枪来打他们的弟兄。码头工人叉起了臂膀，拒绝装卸侵略者的武器。农民们保护他们的田地，不让它们变成外国的飞机场。人们来到街头要求和平，盛大的集会举行了，代表不同国籍、不同观点和信仰的人们在这种大会上宣誓保卫和平。成亿的普通人民在誓言一般的宣言上签了名。历史上从来不曾有过这样激动的良知，这样伟大的希望。
    在这些困难的日子中，和平战士们，不论他们住在什么地方，不论他们的见解怎样，他们明白他们应该如何感激斯大林。是他帮助人民防止了新战争，是他拯救了千百万的儿童和成千的城市。
    在罗马的一个大广场上挤满了人。火炬照亮了斯大林的画像，“斯大林是和平”的呼声响彻全场，历久不绝。在密士失必州的一个小城中，一个黑种工人对我说：“他们要驱使我们去屠杀，但斯大林是不会允许的。”在丹麦，一个有五个孩子的普通妇女不断地说：“我不怕他们，因为世界上有斯大林。”
    在中国的农村中，我看到了斯大林的画像。中国人指着画像说：“他保护着我的房屋。”在巴黎的住宅的墙上，两个字眼，它们在人民的心中融合在一起：“斯大林”、“和平”。
    不错，在和平大军中有许许多多人是共产党人，正如在拯救人类免除法西斯奴役的大军中也有许多人是共产党人一样。但是保卫和平的不仅只有共产党人。在各种不同的集会上，各种信仰极其不同的人，如坎特伯雷教长约翰逊、修道院院长布利埃、前德国总理维尔特和意大利自由党人尼蒂都谈到斯大林的英明和对于和平的热爱。在飞到莫斯科来参加这个伟大的和平战士的丧礼的有：印度国大党党员克其鲁，法国进步领袖伊夫·法奇和皮埃尔·戈特，意大利社会党领袖彼特罗·南尼。人类的敌人希望把共产党人和其他的和平战士隔离起来的企图是徒然的。他们想把苏联、中国和人民民主国家和正在保卫和平事业的西欧、美洲和亚洲的其他人民力量隔离起来的计划也是徒然的。斯大林所说的不同的制度和不同的世界完全可以在地球上和平共处的话在人类的心中造成了深刻的印象。这些话把各国人民团结在一起并形成了一支任何卑鄙的战争贩子都不能挫败的力量。
    斯大林一再谈到各国人民的独立权。现在，各国人民知道，没有独立，就没有安全。在反对隐蔽的或公开的占领、反对正在建立来从事新侵略的外国基地和各种不同的“外国军团”的斗争中，他们从斯大林的话中得到了鼓舞。
    斯大林在去年十二月下旬答复美国记者问题时指出：不能认为美国和苏联之间的战争是不可避免的，我们两国在今后也能够和平共处。这是传遍了全世界的、斯大林最后的话。这是最强大的国家和最爱好和平的国家的领袖的话。斯大林保护着全世界的普通人民，反对流血，争取和平。
    当男男女女听到了伟大的和平战士逝世的消息，无论他们住在那里，他们的悲痛是容易理解的。但是人民都知道：斯大林是不会死的。
    他不仅活在他的著作中，不仅活在苏维埃国家的壮大和发展中；他还活在千百万人民，俄罗斯人、中国人、波兰人、德国人、法国人、越南人、意大利人、巴西人、朝鲜人和美国人的心中。当斯大林的心脏停止跳动的时候，悲痛使人类的心脏跳得更快了；普通的人民感到彼此更亲近了，他们明白：人们对斯大林的怀念、斯大林的遗训以及争取和平与人类幸福的斗争，把他们更紧密地团结起来了。
    在斯大林的灵前我们听见了这样几句话：“我们是人民的忠实的勤务员，人民希望和平，痛恨战争。因此，人民的愿望——不让千百万人流血，保证和平地建设幸福的生活——对我们大家说来是神圣的！”这些话就是斯大林同志的思想，是他关怀的目标，他的意志。这些话是从他的战友、苏联政府首长的口中说出来的。这些话将传入一切普通人民的心中，他们将和我们一道说：“斯大林还活着。”
    斯大林是坚强的，因为他了解千百万人民的思想和感情，他表达了他们的希望、他们要求幸福的愿望、他们对和平的渴望。在这些困难的日子里，孩子们像平常一样玩耍，砌砖工人像平常一样站在建筑架上，在太阳比较温暖的地方，人们正在耕种。普通的人民活着，斯大林就活在他们心中。虽然这种悲痛，这种损失是我们难以忍受的，但是我们知道各国人民一定会实行斯大林的遗训，各国人民一定会保卫和平。
