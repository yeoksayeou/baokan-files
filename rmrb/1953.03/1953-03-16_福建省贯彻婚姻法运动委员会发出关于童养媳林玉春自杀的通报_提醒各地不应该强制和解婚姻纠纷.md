The Office of the Fujian Province Implementing Marriage Law Movement Committee issued a circular on February 26th regarding the case of Lin Yuchun, a child bride in Yingshang Township, Sixth District, Longxi County. During key experimental work on implementing the Marriage Law, staff members disregarded Lin Yuchun's legitimate request to dissolve her marriage and conducted unwarranted, forced mediation, leading to Lin Yuchun's tragic suicide. The full text of the circular is as follows:

According to the report from the Longxi Special District Implementing Marriage Law Movement Committee Office: A tragic incident of suicide by child bride Lin Yuchun occurred in Yingshang Township, Sixth District, Longxi County, during key experimental work on implementing the Marriage Law. We believe this is a very serious matter and hereby notify all localities:

Lin Yuchun is 21 years old and a native of Yingshang Township, Sixth District, Longxi County. She became a child bride at the age of six. Her fiancé is developmentally impaired, appearing like a child in his teens despite being over twenty years old, and has a speech impediment. Lin Yuchun was dissatisfied and unwilling to marry him, desiring to find another partner. However, her in-laws forced her to marry their son. Her father-in-law, before his death, even said to Lin Yuchun, "If you don't marry my son, I will haunt you as a ghost after I die." Consequently, family disputes and discord arose. The key experimental workgroup and the township mediation committee, in handling Lin Yuchun's marriage problem, failed to adhere to the provisions of the Marriage Law and the principle of autonomy in marriage for child brides, supporting Lin Yuchun's reasonable demands, and failed to conduct publicity and education among her family and the masses. Instead, they considered it a case of family discord and insisted on mediating for harmony, drafting a "harmonious agreement." To this end, the workgroup conducted individual "mobilization" of Lin Yuchun beforehand. When the harmonious agreement was being drafted, Lin Yuchun, seeing that her marriage could not be freely decided and that she had to maintain harmony, which meant she had to marry her original fiancé, remained silent. After the harmonious agreement was established, disputes erupted again. Lin Yuchun, because her marriage problem could not be reasonably resolved and she saw no hope of breaking free from the shackles of feudal marriage, committed suicide by hanging.

We believe the tragic suicide of Lin Yuchun in Yingshang Township, Sixth District, Longxi County, is a very serious matter. The workgroup and mediation committee of the township, in handling this matter, did not act according to the principle stipulated in "Question Three" of the "Several Questions and Answers Concerning the Implementation of the Marriage Law" promulgated by the Legal Committee of the Central People's Government, which states: "Child brides who were unmarried before the implementation of the Marriage Law, who voluntarily return home or choose another spouse, the man's family shall not hinder them and shall not demand the return of wedding gifts or the recovery of living expenses during the period of child bride service." They failed to vigorously publicize this issue to her family and the masses, explaining the basic spirit of the Marriage Law. Instead, they blindly emphasized harmony, leading to the tragic suicide. We hope that all localities, in the movement to implement the Marriage Law, will pay attention to similar situations to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. This is hereby notified.

    福建省贯彻婚姻法运动委员会发出关于童养媳林玉春自杀的通报
    提醒各地不应该强制和解婚姻纠纷
    福建省贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室在二月二十六日通报龙溪县第六区营尚乡在贯彻婚姻法重点试验工作中，因工作人员漠视童养媳林玉春解除婚约的合法要求，进行无原则的强制性的调解，致使林玉春被迫自杀的惨案。通报全文如下：
    根据龙溪专署贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室报告：龙溪县第六区营尚乡在贯彻婚姻法重点试验工作中，发生了童养媳林玉春自杀的悲惨事件。我们认为这是很严重的问题，特通报各地：
    林玉春现年二十一岁，龙溪县第六区营尚乡人，六岁就当了童养媳。其未婚夫发育不健全，二十多岁好像十多岁的孩子一样，讲话有点哑吧。林玉春不满意，不愿和他结婚，想自己另找对象。但其公婆强迫她要与其儿子结婚。公公在临死时还对林玉春说：“假如你不和我儿子结婚，我死后作鬼都要纠缠你。”因此家庭便闹纠纷，不和睦。重点试验工作组及乡调解委员对林玉春婚姻问题的处理，没有按照婚姻法的规定及童养媳婚姻自主的原则，支持林玉春的合理要求，并向其家庭及群众进行宣传教育；反认为是家庭不和，硬要调解和睦，订和睦公约。为此，工作组事先对林玉春进行了个别“动员”。在订和睦公约时，林玉春见婚姻不能自主，反须和睦，也就是要她一定和原未婚夫结婚，于是一言不发。和睦公约订出后，又吵闹起来。林玉春因为自己的婚姻问题不能得到合理的解决，摆脱封建婚姻的枷锁无望，遂上吊自杀。
    我们认为龙溪县第六区营尚乡发生的林玉春自杀的悲惨事件是很严重的。该乡工作组及调解委员在处理这一问题时，没有根据中央人民政府法制委员会公布的“有关婚姻法施行的若干问题与解答”中“问题三”所规定的：“在婚姻法施行前未婚的童养媳，自愿回家或另择配偶者，男家不得阻碍并不得索还婚礼和讨取在童养时间的生活费”的原则来处理，没有把这一问题向其家庭及群众大力宣传，讲明婚姻法的基本精神，反而盲目强调和睦，以致发生自杀的悲惨事件。希各地在贯彻婚姻法运动中，对类似情况，应引起注意，以免同样事件的发生。特此通报。
