　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 26th. East China is vigorously carrying out spring afforestation. Fujian Province has afforested more than 310,000 mu, Jiangsu Province has afforested more than 127,000 mu, and Shandong, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces are expected to complete their spring afforestation plans by the first half of April.

　　This year, the East China region plans to afforest 3,372,385 mu. Water source forests should be created in the middle reaches of the Huai River, the Min River, the Qiantang River, and other major river upstream areas; windbreak forests and farmland protection forests should be created in coastal and windblown areas; mine pillar forests should be created near mines, railways, roadsides, riverbanks, and national defense fortifications; fuel forests should be created near towns and barren mountains; and scenic forests should be created in cities. The preparatory work for afforestation in East China, such as clearing grass and burning mountains, and seedling supply, has been more thorough this year than in previous years. As early as last year, Zhejiang Province prepared more than 230 million seedlings for afforestation this spring. After the beginning of spring this year, the Shandong Provincial People's Government Forestry Bureau promptly transported 40,300 jin of tree seeds to six special districts, including Jiaozhou and Yishui. Before afforestation, forestry departments in various places trained forestry cadres and afforestation activists; after afforestation began, the Shandong Provincial People's Government Forestry Bureau sent more than 80 cadres to rural areas to provide specific guidance to farmers in afforestation. Many counties and districts widely publicized the benefits of afforestation and the policy of mutual aid and cooperation in afforestation to farmers through various meetings and forestry representative meetings, greatly improving farmers' enthusiasm for planting trees. This year, the area of cooperative afforestation in East China accounts for more than 16% of the total afforestation area. At present, forest protection organizations have been established in all major forest areas to improve the survival rate of newly planted seedlings.

    华东各地大力进行春季植树造林
    【新华社上海二十六日电】华东各地正大力进行春季植树造林。福建省已造林三十一万多亩，江苏省已造林十二万七千多亩，山东、安徽、浙江三省预计到四月上半月都能完成春季植树造林计划。
    今年华东全区计划造林三百三十七万二千三百八十五亩。在淮河中游、闽江、钱塘江和其他一些主要河流上游地区要营造水源林；在沿海和风沙侵袭的地区要营造防风林和农田防护林；在矿山附近、铁路、公路两旁以及河流沿岸、国防要塞要营造矿柱林；在城镇附近和荒山荒地要营造薪炭林；在城市里要营造风景林。华东各地植树造林的准备工作，如劈草炼山、苗木供应等，今年都比往年做得充分。浙江省早在去年就为今春造林准备了二亿三千多万株苗木。山东省人民政府林业局在今年入春后就把四万零三百斤树种及时运到胶州、沂水等六个专区。各地林业部门在造林之前，都训练了林业干部和造林积极分子；开始造林后，山东省人民政府林业局先后派出八十多个干部，下乡具体指导农民造林。很多县、区通过各种会议和林业代表会议，广泛地向农民宣传造林的好处和互助合作造林的政策，大大提高了农民植树造林的积极性。今年华东合作造林的面积约占造林总面积百分之十六以上。现在，各个主要林区都建立了护林组织，以提高新植树苗的成活率。
