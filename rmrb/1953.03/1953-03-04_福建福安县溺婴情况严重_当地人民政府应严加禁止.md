Reader's Letters Abstract

    Serious Situation of Infanticide in Fu'an County, Fujian Province
    Local People's Government Should Strictly Prohibit It
    Liang Yaoju and Zhang Shengyao write: Last December, the Fu'an Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Fujian Province sent a working group to Xinkou District, Fu'an County to investigate the implementation of the Marriage Law. They discovered that the phenomenon of drowning female infants has historically been very serious in this district. According to incomplete statistics, in Linbing Village, Xiuling Township alone, 46 female infants have been drowned since liberation; similar situations exist in other townships. This situation has resulted in the dire consequence of a surplus of men and a shortage of women. Women account for only 36 percent of the total population in the entire district, leading to the severe prevalence of practices such as wife-renting, wife-mortgaging, and shared wives.
    It is recommended that areas with similar situations incorporate the prohibition of infanticide as part of the Marriage Law implementation campaign, vigorously conduct education on gender equality, and explain to the masses that drowning and abandoning infants are criminal acts, in order to eliminate this evil vestige of the feudal system.

    福建福安县溺婴情况严重
    当地人民政府应严加禁止
    梁耀驹、张盛尧来信：去年十二月福建省福安专署派出工作组到福安县新口区调查贯彻婚姻法情况时，发现该区溺毙女婴的现象历来都很严重。据不完全统计，该区秀岭乡林炳村解放后还溺死女婴四十六个；其它乡也有类似情况。这种情况造成了男多女少的恶果。全区妇女只占总人口百分之三十六，租妻、典妻、伙妻等情况因而严重地流行着。
    建议有类似情况的地区在贯彻婚姻法运动中把禁止溺婴作为内容之一，大力进行男女平等的教育，并向群众说明溺婴、弃婴是犯罪行为，以消灭这种封建制度遗留下来的恶习。
