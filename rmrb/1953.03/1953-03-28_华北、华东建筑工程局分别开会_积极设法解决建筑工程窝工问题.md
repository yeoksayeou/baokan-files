    North China and East China Construction Engineering Bureaus Hold Meetings Separately
    Actively Find Ways to Solve the Problem of Construction Project Idling
    On March 10th, the North China Construction Engineering Bureau invited units commissioning construction, the Design Institute of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering, the North China Financial and Economic Committee, and the North China Construction Trade Union Working Committee to hold a joint engineering meeting to study how to solve the problem of idling in construction projects.
    The meeting focused on studying the design and construction of major projects with a larger scale in the North China region. The study results determined that the four major projects, accounting for 450,000 square meters of construction area, which have a decisive significance for the first phase (March 15 to May 15) of construction, are all at risk of idling. The meeting focused on analyzing the reasons for the idling of these four major projects and decided to try to ensure that these four major projects could commence construction successively from the end of March to mid-April.
    The reasons for the idling of these four projects are mainly the delayed allocation of tasks, the uncertain location of the projects, incomplete design data, weak surveying and mapping capabilities, and weak soil testing and analysis capabilities, which seriously affected the progress of design work and made material preparation difficult, even to the point where prepared materials did not know where to be transported. In addition, it takes at least nine review procedures from the issuance of the project task book to the approval of the technical design, which takes a lot of time. Furthermore, construction companies lack funds and are unable to purchase the tools needed for construction, which also delays the start of construction.
    The meeting studied the above situation and, based on the strength of the construction units in the entire region, decided to concentrate efforts to ensure that the four major projects start construction first. It was also decided to call on the construction engineering and technical personnel of the construction engineering companies directly under the North China Construction Engineering Bureau and the Hebei Construction Engineering Bureau to cooperate with the design departments to conduct rush surveying and mapping work, so that the design work can be completed in advance. In order to prepare for the construction of certain larger and important projects in advance, the meeting also agreed to adopt the method of phased design and phased construction after the overall layout is approved. In addition, the issues of appropriation and material preparation were also reasonably resolved at the meeting.
    After the meeting, based on the experience of this meeting, in order to further solve the problem of idling in the entire region, the North China Construction Engineering Bureau and the North China Construction Trade Union Working Committee jointly formed four working groups to go to Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, and Shanxi to conduct specific inspections on the main issues in the current construction preparation work, such as project location, surveying and mapping, design, appropriation, material preparation, and labor allocation and use, and to solve them on the spot in cooperation with relevant departments.
    Another dispatch: In the East China region, due to the fact that most of the new construction tasks this year were determined too late, the preparation work in design and other aspects cannot keep up with the progress of construction, and tens of thousands of construction workers are already facing a serious risk of idling. To this end, the East China Construction Engineering Bureau convened a joint meeting of the heads of construction engineering departments in various provinces and cities in East China in early March to study the solution to the problem of idling.
    According to the statistics of the East China Construction Engineering Bureau, East China currently has a construction force of more than 96,000 people, including more than 42,000 permanent workers. However, the projects that may start construction in the first and second quarters of this year only account for about 30 percent of the total task for the year, which only requires two-thirds of the existing construction force. The remaining one-third will be wasted. The idling phenomenon is not serious in the first and second quarters because there are a large number of cross-year projects from 1952 that can be constructed. However, the preparation work for new projects in 1953 is progressing very slowly. For example, the projects that the basic construction departments have entrusted to the East China Design Company for design only account for 2.5 percent of the new projects this year (excluding those designed by the construction units themselves or using typical drawings). Therefore, by the third quarter, if the old projects are completed and the new projects cannot be connected, there may be a serious risk of idling. At the same time, due to the uneven distribution of engineering tasks in the first half of the year and the second half of the year, the supply of labor and materials will also be difficult in the second half of the year, and there may be a phenomenon of rushing to work and rushing to progress, which will affect the quality of the project.
    In order to avoid the danger of serious idling, the joint meeting convened by the East China Construction Engineering Bureau has put forward the following suggestions and measures: First, it is required that all departments quickly determine the basic construction plan, issue specific construction tasks as early as possible, actively provide design data, and correct the simple reliance on construction departments and the dependent and paralyzed thinking that the time is still early. The construction departments should also take the initiative to contact the construction units and assist in collecting design data. At the same time, in order to change the current situation that the design lags behind the construction, old drawings and typical designs should be used as much as possible in civil buildings to save time. If there is spare time for construction technicians in the first and second quarters, they should support the design work as much as possible, and then return to their construction positions when the construction tasks are busy in the third and fourth quarters. Secondly, the importance and reality of the engineering tasks this year should be combined. Under the principle of ensuring the completion of the central tasks, especially the national defense engineering tasks, we should strive to do more local projects with existing construction conditions in the second quarter to reduce the idling and the engineering burden in the second half of the year. Thirdly, due to the unbalanced distribution of engineering tasks and construction forces this year, some areas have insufficient construction forces, while some areas have surplus. Therefore, it is necessary to make necessary adjustments according to the distribution of tasks and forces under the principle of obeying the overall situation. Finally, in the case that the design year has been postponed, the construction tasks this year are not yet specific, and the design cannot keep up with the construction, a part of the projects this year must be planned to be carried over to next year. This will not only make the engineering in the second half of this year less crowded, but also take care of the start of work next year, so that the phenomenon of idling will not occur again.

    华北、华东建筑工程局分别开会
    积极设法解决建筑工程窝工问题
    华北建筑工程局在三月十日邀请各委托建筑的单位和中央建筑工程部设计院、华北财政经济委员会、华北建筑工会工作委员会举行工程联席会议，研究如何解决窝工问题。
    会议着重研究了华北全区规模较大的主要工程的设计和施工问题。研究结果，判明对第一期（三月十五日至五月十五日）施工有决定意义的共占四十五万平方公尺建筑面积的四大主要工程都有窝工的危险。会议着重分析了这四大主要工程窝工的原因，决定设法争取使这四大主要工程能在三月底到四月中旬陆续开工。
    这四个工程窝工的原因，主要是任务分配过迟、工程地址没有确定、设计资料很不完备、勘测力量薄弱、土壤化验分析的力量薄弱，因此，严重影响了设计工作的进行，并且使得材料准备工作发生了困难，甚至于准备好的材料也不知道运往何处。此外，一个工程设计由颁发计划任务书到批准技术设计，至少需要经过九道审核手续，费时很多；加以建筑公司缺乏资金，施工所需工具也无力购买，也延迟了工程的开工时间。
    会议研究了上面这些情况，根据全区建筑单位的力量，决定集中力量争取四大主要工程首先开工，并决定调用华北建筑工程局直属建筑工程公司和河北建筑工程局的施工工程技术人员协同设计部门突击测绘工作，使设计工作能提前完成。为提前作好某些较大的重要工程的施工准备工作，会议并议定于总平面布置被批准后，采用分批设计、分批施工的办法。此外，拨款及备料问题也在会议上得到了合理的解决。
    会后，华北建筑工程局根据这次会议的经验，为进一步解决全区窝工问题，又与华北建筑工会工作委员会共同组成四个工作组分别到北京、天津两市和河北、山西两省，就目前施工准备工作中的工程地址、勘测、设计、拨款、备料及劳动力调配和使用等主要问题进行具体检查，并协同有关部门就地加以解决。
    又讯：华东地区由于今年大部分新的建筑任务确定太迟，设计等方面的准备工作赶不上施工的进度，数万建筑工人已有严重的窝工危险。为此，华东建筑工程局在三月初召集华东各省、市建筑工程部门负责人举行联席会议研究解决窝工问题。
    据华东建筑工程局的统计，华东现有建筑力量，包括四万二千多固定工人在内，共有九万六千多人。但今年第一、二两季度可能开工的工程只占全年任务的百分之三十左右，只需要现有建筑力量的三分之二。其余三分之一就要被浪费。第一、二季度因为有大量的一九五二年度跨年度工程可以施工，窝工现象还不严重。但是，一九五三年新工程的准备工作进行很迟缓，如基本建设部门已交华东设计公司进行设计的工程，只占今年新工程的百分之二点五（由建设单位自己设计或用典型图样的不计算在内）。因此，到第三季度的时候，如果旧工程做完了，而新工程接不上，就可能造成严重窝工的危险。同时，由于工程任务上半年松、下半年紧，下半年劳动力与材料供应也将发生困难，并可能发生抢工赶工的现象，这就将影响工程质量。
    为了避免严重窝工的危险，华东建筑工程局召开的联席会议，已提出下面几个建议和办法：首先，要求各部门迅速确定基本建设计划，及早下达具体建筑任务，积极提供设计资料，纠正单纯委托建筑部门和认为时间尚早的依赖和麻痹思想。各建筑部门也应主动向建设单位联系，协助搜集设计资料。同时，为改变目前设计落后于施工的状况，在民用建筑上，应尽量利用旧图及典型设计，以节省时间。第一、二季度施工技术人员有多余时间，应尽量支援设计工作，到第三、四季度施工任务忙时，再回到施工岗位上。其次，把今年度工程任务的重要性和现实性结合起来，在保证完成中央任务，尤其是国防工程任务的原则下，争取在第二季度多做些已有施工条件的地方工程，以减少窝工及下半年工程负担。再次，由于今年的工程任务与建筑力量分布不平衡，造成某些地区建筑力量不够，某些地区则过剩。因此，必须在服从整体的原则下，根据任务及力量的分布情况，加以必要的调整。最后，在设计年度已经推迟，今年度的建筑任务还不具体，以及设计跟不上施工的情况下，必须有计划地把今年一部分工程跨到明年去。这样既能使今年下半年工程不太挤，又照顾到明年度开始有工做，不至于再发生窝工现象。
