Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 11th: According to TASS, from the early morning of March 10th until late at night, people streamed incessantly towards Red Square. They slowly walked past the Mausoleum, bidding farewell to a sleeping giant – Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin. Among them were Muscovites, representatives from all over the Soviet Union, and foreign guests. The number of wreaths they laid before Comrade Stalin's remains was incalculable. The wreaths filled all the space around the Mausoleum, covering the reviewing stand, and many others were placed along the Kremlin wall between the Spassky Tower and the Nikolsky Tower. There were wreaths decorated with colorful silk threads by female workers from the Noginsk silk factory in the Moscow region, wreaths woven with fragrant roses by the working people of Georgia and the Central Asian republics, wreaths made of laurel and mimosa from the Black Sea coast, and wreaths of dark coniferous trees sent by the people of the northern regions. On the black-bordered red ribbons, people wrote from the bottom of their hearts in Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Georgian, German, French, and many other languages, expressing their boundless love for their great leader.

Wreaths continued to arrive incessantly: from Moscow primary school students, and from the great communist construction sites on the Volga River.

The people's love for Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the brilliant successor to Lenin's cause and the great architect of communism, is infinite and immeasurable. (Attached picture)

    苏联人民和外宾继续到红场向斯大林告别
   【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：从三月十日清晨直到深夜，人们川流不息地涌向红场。他们慢慢地走过陵墓，向一位长眠了的巨人——约·维·斯大林告别。这些人当中有莫斯科人，有苏联各地来的代表，也有外国的来宾。他们在斯大林同志灵前献的花圈多得不可计算。花圈把陵墓周围的一切地方都占满了，把检阅台也遮起来了，另外还有许多摆在斯巴斯基塔和尼古尔斯基塔之间的克里姆林宫墙边。那里有莫斯科州诺金斯克丝厂的女工用各色丝线装饰的花圈，有格鲁吉亚和各中亚细亚共和国的劳动人民用芬芳的玫瑰扎成的花圈，也有黑海沿岸送来的用月桂树和含羞草扎成的花圈和北部地区人民送来的暗色的针叶树扎成的花圈。在那些镶黑边的红色缎带上，人们用俄罗斯文、乌克兰文、白俄罗斯文、格鲁吉亚文、德文、法文和其他许多文字写下自己心底的话，表达他们对于伟大领袖的无限的热爱。
    花圈继续不断地送来：从莫斯科小学生那里送来，从伏尔加河上伟大的共产主义建筑工地上送来。
    人民对列宁事业的光辉继承者、共产主义的伟大建筑师约·维·斯大林的爱是无穷无尽的，是无法测量的。（附图片）
