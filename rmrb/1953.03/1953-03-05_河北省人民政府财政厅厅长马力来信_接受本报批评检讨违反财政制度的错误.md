Hebei Provincial People's Government Finance Department Director Ma Li wrote a letter stating: The People's Daily on February 7th, second page, exposed the fact that "the Hebei Provincial Finance Department seriously violated financial regulations, accumulating and misappropriating a large amount of funds that should have been turned over to the central government." We sincerely accept this exposure and criticism. Combining this matter with the province's ongoing struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, we mobilized all staff members to earnestly discuss this matter. Everyone unanimously believes that the Finance Department's violation of financial regulations is extremely serious. Not only did it result in the accumulation of funds that should have been turned over to the central government, but it also displayed an extremely uncooperative, even confrontational attitude towards the joint inspection by the Central Ministry of Finance and the North China Finance Bureau. This kind of mistake is even more intolerable. Our finance department should resolutely implement central regulations and become a model of compliance with financial regulations. However, we ourselves violated financial regulations, which is truly unacceptable under national discipline. The reason why we made such mistakes, in addition to the People's Daily already pointing out that we have serious departmentalism and have committed serious errors of lack of organization and discipline, is that we also have a very serious bureaucratic work style. We have been unable to check and correct the phenomenon of violating financial regulations for a long time, turned a blind eye to the long-standing confusion of accounts and discrepancies in figures, and failed to earnestly discuss and resolutely implement the central government's instructions, laws, regulations, systems, decisions, and orders. This is our serious dereliction of duty.

In order to correct our mistakes, in the future, in addition to ensuring the resolute implementation of all central government instructions, decisions, systems, laws, regulations, and orders, we will also submit our Finance Department's self-criticism regarding the violation of financial regulations and future improvement suggestions to the People's Daily for public publication to educate ourselves and educate everyone.

    河北省人民政府财政厅厅长马力来信
    接受本报批评检讨违反财政制度的错误
    河北省人民政府财政厅厅长马力来信称：人民日报二月七日第二版揭发了“河北省财政厅严重违反财政制度，大量积压和挪用应该上缴中央的款项”的事实，我们诚恳地接受这种揭发和批评。我们结合本省已开展的反对官僚主义、反对强迫命令、反对违法乱纪的斗争，发动全厅工作人员认真地讨论这件事情。大家一致认为：本厅违反财政制度的错误是极其严重的，不仅使应该上缴中央的款项积压下来，而且对中央财政部、华北财政局的联合检查表现了极不虚心、甚至对抗的情绪。这种错误更是不能容忍的。我们财政部门本应坚决贯彻执行中央规定，成为遵守财政制度的模范。但我们自己就违反了财政制度，这实为国家纪律所不容。我们所以犯这样的错误，除人民日报已指出我们有严重的本位主义思想和犯了严重的无组织无纪律的错误外，我们还存在着十分严重的官僚主义作风，对于违反财政制度的现象长期不能检查纠正，对长期存在的账目混乱、数字不符的现象熟视无睹，对中央的指示、法令、制度、决定和命令不认真讨论和坚决执行，这是我们严重的失职。
    为了纠正错误，我们今后除保证坚决执行中央一切指示、决定、制度、法令和命令外，并把我厅违反财政制度的检讨和今后改进意见，送交人民日报公开刊载，以教育我们自己并教育大家。
