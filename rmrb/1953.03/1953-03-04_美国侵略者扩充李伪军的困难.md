The Wall Street blood-drinking group has always made money by shedding the blood of others. This bloody deed they have carried out in Korea, although it has earned them hundreds of millions of dollars, has cost the lives of more than 320,000 Americans. Such a huge attrition of soldiers cannot but arouse increasing resistance from the American people. Thus, the war maniac Eisenhower, upon entering the White House, clamored to "use Asians to fight Asians," and accelerated the training and expansion of the Li pseudo-army, attempting to use more Li pseudo-soldiers as cannon fodder to reduce American casualties and ease the opposition sentiment within the United States. According to a United Press report, under the command of the American army, the Li Seung-man clique is directly copying the "National General Mobilization Law" that Japanese imperialists once implemented in Korea, forcibly conscripting all men between the ages of 19 and 50 to serve as cannon fodder and perform hard labor. Police, gendarmes, and secret agents of the American and Li gangs scattered in various places, throwing thousands of innocent people into prison every day and slaughtering them in large numbers. The victims are accused of opposing the war, opposing conscription, and sabotaging the "General Mobilization Law." At the same time, in order to maintain such an army that is pieced together by forced conscription, it has almost exhausted the Li Seung-man clique's treasury, causing the South Korean economy to collapse. According to the budget for the 1953 fiscal year submitted by the Li Seung-man clique to the pseudo-National Assembly, the total amount reached 726 billion South Korean won, of which military spending will account for more than 83 percent of the total expenditure, while revenue is only 215.5 billion won. Therefore, the deficit reached 510.5 billion won. This has accelerated malignant inflation, causing soaring prices and making people's lives even more painful. The so-called "currency reform" recently implemented by the Li Seung-man clique is a disguised and more cruel plunder of the suffering South Korean people.

All of this will inevitably arouse greater resistance from the South Korean people and put the American and Li bandits in a more dangerous situation. As the famous Soviet commentator Zaslavsky pointed out: "The more Koreans who are grabbed to serve in the American army, the more places the American army needs to guard. The front line is not only on the 38th parallel, where South Koreans must pave the way for American tanks with their flesh and blood, but also scattered in various places where forced conscription has aroused the people's hatred for the intervention army."

The vast majority of those who are grabbed to serve as Li's pseudo-soldiers are poor laborers who have been deeply persecuted by the American and Li gangs. They are extremely resentful of the fascist rule implemented by the American and Li gangs in all cities and towns of South Korea. In South Korea, the U.S. military, under the pretext of "military measures" and "suppressing guerrillas," burned and destroyed 50 cities and 1,006 villages in South Korea, and more than 10,860,000 refugees lost their homes and property. According to the Li Seung-man gang's report, the so-called "United Nations" and the Li pseudo-government jointly established 1,702 refugee camps, and the seven shelters in Wonju alone accommodated 250,000 refugees. These refugee camps are truly hell on earth. The American and Li gangs shamelessly ravaged South Korean women. Tens of thousands of South Korean women were forced to form the so-called "American Military Comfort Corps," and the pseudo-Ministry of National Defense shamelessly levied 40 to 50 percent of their taxes in the name of "national defense expenses." In Seoul alone, more than 56,000 women were raped, most of whom were female students and young housewives. In this tragic encounter, the South Korean people have joined the guerrilla teams resisting the American and Li gangs. Many soldiers who were grabbed to serve as Li's pseudo-soldiers will inevitably gradually realize that the American and Li gangs are their real enemies, and they are unwilling to die for their enemies.

In the Li pseudo-army, the contradiction between officers and soldiers is becoming increasingly acute. The American and Li gangs inherited and developed the Japanese rule's military阀 beating management system and a set of fascist secret service systems in the Li Seung-man pseudo-army. Most of the Li pseudo-army officers were also gendarmes, secret agents, or pseudo-Manchukuo officers during the Japanese rule, and have always been enemies of the broad masses of the people. It is common for pseudo-military officers to beat and insult soldiers. One captured Li pseudo-army soldier said: He was beaten once every three days on average; another captured Li pseudo-army soldier said that he was beaten 11 times in 15 days on the Western Front. Pseudo-military battalion commanders (equivalent to battalion commanders) and above can even arbitrarily execute soldiers. The phenomenon of deduction and embezzlement is extremely serious. The soldiers' rations are six 合 of rice per person per day. After layers of deduction and embezzlement, the soldiers can only eat three 合 of rice per day. They often cannot get enough to eat, so they steal and rob whenever they have the opportunity, otherwise they have to dig wild vegetables to eat, and many are poisoned after eating them.

In this way, when the Li pseudo-army is forced to go into battle, it becomes increasingly unable to withstand the attacks of our army. Recently, the so-called elite of the South Korean army, the pseudo-2nd Division, suffered a major blow in the Battle of Shangganling. Many units were defeated, and they were defeated quickly and cleanly. Many battalions, companies, and platoons in the pseudo-army were wiped out completely after being pulled to the front for two or three days, and some were wiped out completely on the same day. Originally, some Li pseudo-army soldiers who had illusions about the "superior weapons" of the U.S. military have also changed their thinking. They said: "The Communist army is fighting for the poor, who are we fighting for? Aren't we dying for the rich! Can the rich and powerful come to be soldiers?" The phenomena of desertion, self-injury, feigning illness, and suicide in the Li pseudo-army are also becoming increasingly serious. One regiment had 37 desertion incidents in one night, and seven out of nine people in another class deserted in less than a week after going to the front. Last December, a new recruit of the Li pseudo-army on the Eastern Front used a bayonet to scrape off a piece of bark while on night sentry duty, writing: "Poor people, who are we fighting for, who are we dying for," and then committed suicide. When the Li pseudo-army soldiers were in extreme pessimism and despair, our army's propaganda work illuminated a path of self-rescue for them. More and more Li pseudo-army soldiers are surrendering to our army. Especially recently, as the United States clamors for new military adventures, lower-ranking officers and soldiers of the Li pseudo-army, who are panicking, have crossed the surveillance posts set up by the American and Li gangs on the front line and surrendered to our army. According to the Korean Central News Agency, the number of Li pseudo-army officers and soldiers who surrendered to our army between February 2nd and February 13th increased to more than eight times that of January. The surrender of the Li pseudo-army is not limited to the army, but also includes the air force, not only individual, but also collective; not only soldiers, but also lower and middle-ranking officers.

Therefore, the American aggressors' attempt to expand the Li pseudo-army to solve the serious difficulty of insufficient U.S. military strength and to expand the war is bound to fail.

    美国侵略者扩充李伪军的困难
    金凤
    华尔街喝血集团一直是靠别人流血来赚钱的。这次他们在朝鲜所干的血腥勾当，虽然使自己赚进了数以亿计的美元，但却付出了三十二万以上美国人的生命的代价。这样巨大的兵员消耗，不能不引起美国人民对它们愈来愈大的反抗。于是，战争狂徒艾森豪威尔一进白宫，就大叫大嚷要“用亚洲人打亚洲人”，加紧训练和扩充李伪军，企图利用更多的李伪军来当炮灰，以减少美军的伤亡，缓和美国国内的反对情绪。据合众社消息，李承晚匪帮正在美军的指挥下，原封不动地搬用日本帝国主义者曾在朝鲜实行过的“国民总动员法”，强征十九岁到五十岁的全部男子去充当炮灰和担任苦役。散布各地的美李匪帮的警察宪兵和特务，每天把数千无辜的人民投入监狱，并大批加以杀害。受害者的罪名是反对战争，反对征兵，破坏“总动员法”。同时，为了维持这样一支七拼八凑强拉硬征得来的军队，几乎耗尽了李承晚匪帮的财库，使南朝鲜经济趋于崩溃。据李承晚匪帮向伪国会提出的一九五三会计年度预算，总额共达七万二千六百亿南朝鲜元，其中军费将占总支出百分之八十三强，而岁收仅二万一千五百五十亿元。因此，赤字就达到五万一千零五十亿元。这就加速了恶性通货膨胀，造成物价暴涨，人民生活更加痛苦。最近李承晚匪帮实行的所谓“币制改革”，就是对苦难的南朝鲜人民进行的一种变相的更残酷的掠夺。
    这一切，不可避免地要引起南朝鲜人民更大的反抗，而使美李匪帮处于更危险的境地。正如苏联著名评论家萨斯拉夫斯基所指出的：“朝鲜人被抓去替美军当兵的人越多，美军需要警戒的地方也就越多。战线不仅是在南朝鲜人必须以血肉之躯替美军坦克铺平道路的三八线上，而且也散布在强迫征兵已经引起人民对于干涉军的痛恨的各地。”
    绝大部分被抓去当李伪军的，都是深受美李匪帮迫害的贫苦劳动人民，他们对美李匪帮在南朝鲜所有城乡所实行的法西斯统治，极为痛恨。在南朝鲜，美军借口“军事措施”和“讨伐游击队”，烧毁和破坏了南朝鲜五十个城市、一千零六个村庄，失去了家乡和财产的难民达一千零八十六万多人。即据李承晚匪帮报告，所谓“联合国”与李伪政府共建立了一千七百零二个难民营，仅原州一地七个收容所就收容难民二十五万人。这些难民收容所是真正的人间地狱。美李匪帮荒淫无耻地蹂躏着南朝鲜的妇女。数以万计的南朝鲜妇女被迫组成所谓“美军慰安队”，伪国防部还无耻地以“国防费”名义征收她们百分之四十到五十的税金。在汉城一地，被蹂躏的妇女就有五万六千多名，其中大部分是女学生和年轻的家庭妇女。在这种悲惨遭遇中，南朝鲜人民纷纷参加反抗美李匪帮的游击队，被抓去充当李伪军的许多士兵，也必然会逐渐认识到美李匪帮是他们真正的敌人，他们是不愿替自己的敌人去送死的。
    在李伪军中，官兵之间的矛盾日益尖锐化。美李匪帮在李承晚伪军中继承和发展了日本统治时期军阀打骂的管理制度及一套法西斯特务制度。李伪军军官也多半是日本统治时期的宪兵、特务或伪满士官出身的，素来就与广大人民为敌。伪军官殴辱士兵是经常的事，一个被俘的李伪军士兵说：他平均三天要挨打一次；另一个被俘的李伪军士兵说他在西线十五天挨打十一次。伪军大队长（相当于营长）以上军官，甚至可以任意处死士兵。克扣贪污现象极为严重，士兵的口粮每人一天六合米，经过层层克扣贪污，士兵每天只能吃到三合米。他们常常吃不饱，有机会就偷，就抢，否则就只得挖野菜吃，很多吃了中毒。
    这样，李伪军被迫上阵作战时，就越来越经不起我军的打击。最近，所谓南朝鲜军精锐的伪二师，在上甘岭战斗中就受到了重大的打击，很多单位被打垮，而且垮得快，垮得干净。伪军中很多营、连、排拉上阵地两三天就被全歼，有的当天就被全歼。原来一部分对美军“优势武器”有幻想的李伪军士兵，思想也起了变化，他们说：“共军是为穷人拼命，我们为谁打仗呢？还不是为富人送死！有钱有势的能来当兵吗？”李伪军中逃亡、自伤、装病、自杀的现象，也益见严重。有一个团一夜就有三十七起逃亡事件，又一个班九个人上阵不到一星期就逃亡了七个。去年十二月东线李伪军一个新兵在夜间值哨时用刺刀把树皮刮去一块，写着：“可怜的人们，为谁而战、为谁而死”，然后自杀。当李伪军士兵处于极端悲观、绝望的时候，我军的宣传工作为他们照亮了一条自救的道路。李伪军士兵向我军投降的越来越多。特别是在最近，美国叫嚣要进行新军事冒险，惶惶不安的李伪军下级军官和士兵，纷纷越过美李匪帮设在前线的监视哨向我军投诚。据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，在二月二日到二月十三日期间，向我军投诚的李伪军官兵人数，增加到一月份的八倍多。李伪军投诚的不仅限于陆军，还有空军，不仅是个别的，还有集体的；不仅限于士兵，还发展到了中下级军官。
    因此，美国侵略者企图扩充李伪军来解救美军兵力不足的严重困难，并借以扩大战争，那是必定要失败的。
