Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 14th: On March 14th—the seventieth anniversary of Karl Marx's death—"Pravda" published an article by Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, commemorating the great teacher and leader of the world's proletariat.

Pieck wrote that Marx was a great scientist and revolutionary who actively and enthusiastically fought for the liberation of the international working class. Under the direct influence of Marx and Engels, the "League of the Just" was transformed in the summer of 1847 into the "Communist League," a political organization of the German working class. According to the instructions of the "Communist League," Marx and Engels drafted the league's program, which was the "Communist Manifesto," the first program of scientific socialism. Stalin called this manifesto "the quintessence of Marxism."

Marx discovered the economic laws of capitalism, pointed out the historical inevitability of the demise of capitalist society and the inevitable emergence of a new social system—socialism—to replace it.

Pieck discussed Lenin's and Stalin's brilliant and creative development of Marx's theories. He then pointed out: Liberated people are building socialism, drawing rich experience from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and repeatedly learning from J.V. Stalin, the great defender and successor of Marx, Engels, and Lenin's theories. For the people still enslaved under the yoke of imperialism, the brilliant example of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries applying the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin is a source of endless strength for them in their struggle to liberate themselves from social and national oppression.

Pieck pointed out that Marx always attached particular importance to the development of the German working class. He said that the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany had announced 1953 as the Marx Memorial Year. The Central Committee's decision stated: The purpose of the Marx Memorial Year is "to make the German people understand the worldwide significance of the greatest son of the German nation, and to educate the working masses in the spirit of an uncompromising struggle for the socialist social system."

Pieck concluded by saying that in close friendship with the socialist Soviet Union, which has already realized Marx's theories, the German working class is today also striving to turn socialism into reality in Germany—Marx's homeland.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 15th: The seventieth anniversary of the death of Karl Marx, the founder of communism, is being widely commemorated throughout the Soviet Union. Lectures, reports, and exhibitions have been held in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Alma-Ata, Tbilisi, and other cities for this purpose. The Moscow State Historical Library has held an exhibition on the life and works of this great leader and teacher of the world proletariat. On display at the exhibition are various editions of Marx's works, as well as articles about him written by his old friend Engels and the great successors to Marx's cause, Lenin and Stalin. The exhibition also has a special display area called "Lenin and Stalin's Further Creation of Marxism." According to reports from Riga, the Latvian State Publishing House has published a volume of letters exchanged between Marx, Engels, and Russian political leaders in Latvian.

    苏联各地广泛纪念共产主义创始者马克思
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：三月十四日——卡尔·马克思逝世七十周年纪念日——“真理报”刊载了德国统一社会党主席威廉·皮克纪念这位全世界无产阶级伟大的导师和领袖的一篇文章。
    皮克写道，马克思是伟大的科学家和革命家，他曾经积极地、热情地为国际工人阶级的解放事业而斗争。在马克思和恩格斯的直接影响下，“正义者同盟”在一八四七年的夏天变成了德国工人阶级的政治组织“共产主义者同盟”。按照“共产主义者同盟”的指示，马克思和恩格斯起草了这个同盟的政纲、也就是第一个科学社会主义的政纲“共产党宣言”。斯大林称这个宣言是“马克思主义精华的精华”。
    马克思发现了资本主义的经济法则，指出了资本主义社会灭亡的历史性的不可避免以及代之而起的新的社会制度——社会主义的必然产生。
    皮克论述了列宁和斯大林对于马克思学说的天才的创造性的发展。他接着指出：被解放了的人民正在建设社会主义，他们从苏联共产党吸取了丰富的经验，向马克思、恩格斯和列宁学说的伟大维护者和继承人约·维·斯大林反复学习。对于还在帝国主义枷锁下被奴役的人民来说，苏联和各人民民主国家应用马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林学说的辉煌榜样，是他们在争取从社会和民族压迫下解放出来的斗争中汲取无尽力量的源泉。
    皮克指出马克思一向特别重视德国工人阶级的发展。他说，德国统一社会党中央委员会曾宣布一九五三年为马克思纪念年。中央委员会的决定指出：马克思纪念年的目的在于“使德国人民了解德国民族最伟大的儿子的世界性的意义，并以争取社会主义社会制度的不可调和的斗争的精神来教育劳动群众”。
    皮克在结语中说，在和已经实现了马克思的学说的社会主义国家苏联的亲密友谊中，德国工人阶级今天也正在努力在德国——马克思的故乡——把社会主义变成现实。
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：苏联各地广泛纪念共产主义的创始者卡尔·马克思逝世的七十周年。莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、明斯克、阿拉木图、第比利斯和其他各城市都为此举行了讲演会、报告会和展览会。莫斯科国立历史图书馆举办了一个关于这个世界无产阶级的伟大领袖和导师的生平及其著作的展览会。在这个展览会上展出的有马克思著作的各种版本以及他的老友恩格斯和马克思事业的伟大继承者列宁及斯大林所写的关于他的文章。展览会并专门辟有名叫“列宁和斯大林对于马克思主义的进一步创造”的展览台。据里加的消息说，拉脱维亚国家出版局以列特文出版了一卷马克思、恩格斯和俄罗斯政治领袖们的来往信札。
