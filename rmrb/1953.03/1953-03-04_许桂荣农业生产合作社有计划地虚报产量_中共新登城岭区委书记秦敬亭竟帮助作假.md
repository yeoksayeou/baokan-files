Our reporters Yao Liwen and Zhou Huizhi report: The Xu Guirong Agricultural Production Cooperative of Chengling District, Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, sent a letter on September 15 last year to all agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and model workers in the province who had accepted their challenge, reporting good news. The letter stated: "This year, our entire cooperative planted 141 mu of rice (the actual area after measurement), harvesting a total of 98,775 jin of dried grain, averaging 700.5 jin of dried grain per mu, exceeding the original plan of an average yield of 700 jin per mu. The cooperative's 11 mu of 'thousand-jin fields' produced a total of 9,766 jin of grain, of which 7 mu achieved yields of over 1,000 jin per mu. Only four mu of 'thousand-jin fields' were affected by four major floods, which impacted the tillering and maturation of the rice, and did not complete the plan."

According to our understanding and verification from all sides, all the above-mentioned yields are false. The total output was inflated by approximately 22,000 jin; not a single "thousand-jin field" reached 1,000 jin, and the highest yield per mu was only 882 jin (using a 90% scale).

When the "thousand-jin fields" of the Xu Guirong Agricultural Production Cooperative were about to be harvested, the CCP Xindeng County Chengling District Committee notified farmers throughout the district to come and observe, and the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry also sent cadres to supervise the harvest. At this time, Xu Guirong already knew that he could not complete the plan. Fearing losing face and reputation, he discussed solutions with several cadres in the cooperative. Someone suggested harvesting early, but Xu Guirong disagreed, saying that people would suspect it. Someone else suggested using a small scale to weigh the grain, which could add ten jin to every hundred jin. At that time, it was raining, and the cadre sent by the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry wanted to return to attend a meeting, asking them whether to harvest. They said no. As soon as the cadre from the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry left, they immediately harvested one mu of "thousand-jin field" on August 20th. The harvested fresh grain was weighed using a small scale, totaling 1,384 jin. According to on-site estimates by visiting masses, the fresh grain would yield 65% to 70% when dried. But someone said that 85% could be counted. Because opinions were not unified, it was dried in the dim sunlight that afternoon and then weighed again, totaling 1,090 jin. Everyone still said it was not enough, so they said they would dry it again. During this drying, they also picked 180 jin of dry grain from elsewhere, combined it, and weighed it with a true scale, totaling 1,062 jin of dry grain. This mu of "thousand-jin field" actually only yielded 882 jin. The yields of the other six mu of "thousand-jin fields" were also fabricated in this way. The masses knew the truth, but did not dare to speak out, because this was a "model" being created by many cadres.

The yield of the entire cooperative was also fabricated. During the autumn harvest, Qin Jingting, Secretary of the CCP Chengling District Committee, and Chen Tianjie and Zhu Jishe, cadres of the Working Team of the Rural Work Committee of the CCP Zhejiang Provincial Committee, went to the cooperative. At this time, the cooperative had already harvested 648 dan of rice, which was calculated at 145 jin of dried grain per dan (generally only 120 to 130 jin could be obtained). It was estimated that even with the unharvested rice, the average yield per mu would be less than 600 jin. The cadres in the cooperative were very worried. Qin Jingting criticized them, saying: "What's going on? Is there a mistake in the statistics? Investigate further." (Later, Wang Linshan, the vice-chairman of the cooperative, said: We had no idea what to do, but Instructor Qin gave us a hint.) After Qin Jingting left, Xu Guirong convened another meeting of the board and members, asking everyone to think of solutions. He said: So much fertilizer was applied, and if the plan is not completed, it will be difficult to explain to the outside, and it will not be glorious. At this time, he proposed inflating the number of grain dan, and everyone agreed, stipulating that fields with larger areas would report one more dan, and smaller fields would report half a dan more. The next day, Qin Jingting and others came again to summarize the grain dan, and the members falsely reported 32.5 dan, plus 18 dan of late rice (which had not yet been harvested, this was an estimate), totaling 698 dan. Calculated at 145 jin of dried grain per dan of mid-season rice and 130 jin per dan of late rice, the total was 98,775 jin. If this number is averaged over the cooperative's 154 mu of land, the yield would still be less than 700 jin per mu. Qin Jingting then came up with a method of measuring the land, using ropes to measure the land, turning 154 mu into 141 mu. In this way, the average yield per mu would be 700.5 jin.

In mid-September, the late rice of the cooperative had been mostly harvested, and the vast majority of the mid-season rice had also been dried, and distribution was about to begin. At that time, it was calculated that the total output of the cooperative was only more than 76,000 jin of dried grain. Xu Guirong convened the third meeting of the board and members, with more than 20 people participating. Xu Guirong said to everyone: "Now there are only two paths: one is to honestly report to the higher authorities and admit that we have not completed the production plan; the other is for everyone to think of ways to deal with this problem." Everyone unanimously believed that the number of grain dan had already been inflated, so how could they still report to the higher authorities? Everyone then studied the distribution methods, deciding that land and labor would be divided into three shares, with labor divided into two shares and land divided into one share. During the accounting process, Xu Guirong convened a fourth meeting, with seven cooperative cadres participating. Some cadres said: "We are doing this against Chairman Mao." Most cadres feared that "lotus leaves cannot wrap old water chestnuts forever; sooner or later they will be exposed," and also worried that it would be difficult to lead the members in the future. As a result of the discussion, Xu Guirong instructed: "The matter has already been done, and from now on, everyone is not allowed to talk about it; whoever talks about it will be responsible; as long as everyone doesn't talk about it, others won't know." The meeting decided to record the false number of more than 22,000 jin separately on the accounts of each household, as the autumn advance payment of grain for the members; and to notify each household member individually; and repeatedly instructed the members not to tell anyone outside. After Xu Guirong returned from Beijing after attending the National Day celebrations, he made another "seal the lips" arrangement. The average yield per mu of 700.5 jin of the Xu Guirong Agricultural Production Cooperative was fabricated in this way.

The Rural Work Committee of the CCP Zhejiang Provincial Committee and the CCP Xindeng County Committee and Chengling District Committee demonstrated serious bureaucratic work style in handling the output issue of the Xu Guirong Agricultural Production Cooperative. During the autumn harvest, the county committee did not send anyone to inspect at all. Although the Provincial Party Committee's Rural Work Committee sent the Production Section Chief Chen Xiaoru to inspect, Chen did not personally go to the cooperative, only listening to the reports of the cadres. Qin Jingting, Secretary of the District Committee, rarely went to the cooperative normally. He went several times during the autumn harvest, but only wanted achievements. When he discovered that the cooperative could not complete the plan, he tried every means to help them fabricate, which had a very bad effect.

    许桂荣农业生产合作社有计划地虚报产量
    中共新登城岭区委书记秦敬亭竟帮助作假
    本报记者姚力文、周慧之报道：浙江省新登县城岭区许桂荣农业生产合作社在去年九月十五日写信向全省向他们应战的农业生产合作社、互助组、劳动模范等报喜。信里说：“今年我们全社种了一百四十一亩水稻（经丈量后的实际面积），共收九万八千七百七十五斤干谷，平均每亩收干谷七百零半斤，超额完成了原订平均每亩产量七百斤的计划。全社的十一亩‘千斤田’，共产谷九千七百六十六斤，其中有七亩的产量达到每亩一千斤以上。只有四亩‘千斤田’因连受四次大水，影响了水稻的发稞和成熟，没有完成计划。”
    据我们从各方面了解、对证，上面说的这些产量全是假的。总产量虚报了约二万二千多斤；“千斤田”的产量没有一亩达到一千斤，最高的一亩产量也只有八百八十二斤（还是用九成秤称的）。
    许桂荣农业生产合作社的“千斤田”快要收割的时候，中共新登县城岭区区委会曾通知全区农民来参观，省农林厅也派了干部来监收。这时许桂荣已知道不能完成计划。他怕丢人，没名誉，便和社里几个干部商量办法。这时有人提议起早收割，许桂荣不同意，说这样人家会怀疑，又有人提议用小秤来称，每百斤能多出十斤。当时正在下雨，省农林厅派来的干部要回去开会，问他们收不收？他们说不收。省农林厅干部走了，他们立即在八月二十日把一亩“千斤田”收了。收下来的鲜谷，用小秤来称，有一千三百八十四斤。据参观群众当场估计，鲜谷如果晒成干壳，要打六五折，顶多是七折。但有人说，打个八五折也算。因为意见不统一，便在当天下午的阴暗的阳光下晒了一下，再称为一千零九十斤。大家还说不行，他们就说再晒。在这次晒的时候，他们又从别处挑来一百八十斤干谷，合在一起用真秤称，共有干谷一千零六十二斤。这亩“千斤田”实际上只有八百八十二斤。其余六亩“千斤田”的产量，也是这样假造的。群众心中有数，但不敢讲，因为这是许多干部在那里搞的“典型”。
    全社的产量也是假造出来的。秋收时，中共城岭区区委书记秦敬亭和中共浙江省委农村工作委员会工作队干部陈天杰、朱继畲等到该合作社去，这时该社已收了六百四十八担稻谷，以每担折干谷一百四十五斤（一般只能折一百二十斤到一百三十斤）计算，估计再加上没有收割的，平均每亩还不到六百斤。社里的干部都很担心，秦敬亭就批评他们说：“怎么搞的？是不是统计错啦？再了解了解。”（以后该社副社长王林山说：我们正没有办法，秦指导员提示了我们。）秦敬亭走后，许桂荣又召开了理事、社员会，要大家想办法。他说：肥料下得这样多，计划完不成，向外面不好交代，也不光荣。这时他提出虚报谷担的意见，大家同意，并议定田面大的多报一担，小的多报半担。第二天，秦敬亭等又来总结谷担，社员就虚报了三十二担半，再加上十八担晚稻（当时还未收获，这是估计数），共合六百九十八担。以每担中稻一百四十五斤，晚稻一百三十斤计算，共是九万八千七百七十五斤。这个数字如以全社一百五十四亩田平均，每亩还不到七百斤。秦敬亭又想出丈量地亩的办法，用绳子拉地，把一百五十四亩拉成一百四十一亩。这样，每亩平均就有七百零半斤了。
    九月中旬，该社晚稻已大部收割完毕，中稻谷绝大部分也晒干了，就要进行分配了，当时计算全社总产量只有七万六千多斤干谷。许桂荣召开了第三次理事和社员会议，共有二十多人参加。许桂荣对大家说：“现在只有两条路：一条是老老实实向上级反映，承认我们生产计划没有完成；一条是大家想办法来处理这个问题。”大家一致认为谷担已多报了，那里还可以向上级反映？大家就来研究分配办法，决定土地、劳力三股分，劳力分两股，土地分一股。在算账中间，许桂荣又召开了第四次会议，有七个社干部参加。有的干部说：“我们做这件事情是对不住毛主席的。”大部分干部怕“荷叶包老菱，迟早要被识破”，还怕以后不好领导社员了。研究结果，许桂荣布置说：“事情已做了，以后大家不准讲，谁讲了谁负责；只要大家不讲，别人是不会知道的。”会议决定将二万二千多斤虚数分别记到各户的账上，作为社员的秋季预付谷；以个别通知的办法，通知各户社员；并一再嘱咐社员不准向外讲。许桂荣到北京参加国庆观礼回来后，又作了一次“封口”布置。许桂荣农业生产合作社平均每亩产量七百零半斤，就是这样制造出来的。
    中共浙江省委农村工作委员会和中共新登县委、城岭区委在处理许桂荣农业生产合作社的产量问题上表现了严重的官僚主义作风。秋收时，县委根本没有派人检查过。省委农村工作委员会虽然派了生产科长陈筱儒前往检查，但陈并没有亲自到社里，光听了干部的汇报。区委书记秦敬亭平时很少到该社去，秋收时去了几次，只是单纯要成绩，发现该社不能完成计划时，就想尽办法替他们作假，起了很坏的作用。
