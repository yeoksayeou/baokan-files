Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 27th: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued to discuss the issue of American intervention in the internal affairs of other countries on the 25th. Representatives from Belarus, Ukraine, and Poland spoke at the meeting, further exposing the facts of the United States' subversive and destructive activities against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and denouncing the United States for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

　　During the morning session, Kuzma V. Kiselev, head of the delegation of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, drew the committee's attention to the fact that the U.S. Congress had passed the Mutual Security Act, the Carlston Amendment, which allocated $100 million for subversive espionage and sabotage activities against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. This was a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and the principles of international law.

　　American newspapers have acknowledged that the U.S. government is sending spies and saboteurs into the People's Democracies. For example, Colonel Leonard Nason, a military journalist for the "Newark Star-Ledger," wrote on December 17, 1951, that he was well aware that the United States was conducting espionage and sabotage activities behind the Iron Curtain, although he did not know how much money the United States was spending on this. He also said that these large-scale activities explained why American agents were often arrested. Kiselev also said that U.S. Representative Lodge had not refuted the numerous facts cited by the representatives of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union in his speech.

　　Kiselev concluded by saying that the delegation of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic fully supported the proposal of the delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic and would vote in favor of it.

　　Representatives from Greece, Canada, Turkey, Costa Rica, Tito's Yugoslavia, and the Kuomintang agent then spoke, saying that they would vote against the Czechoslovak proposal, but they all evaded the facts cited by the delegations of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, which irrefutably revealed American interference in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

　　At the afternoon session, the first speaker was British representative Jebb, who continued to evade the facts cited by the delegations of the Soviet Union, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, and Czechoslovakia regarding American espionage, subversion, and sabotage activities in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and repeated those absurd fabrications about the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

　　Baranovsky, head of the delegation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, then spoke, emphasizing that the U.S. Congress's passage of the law of October 10, 1951, and the law of June 20, 1952, was a flagrant act of U.S. interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and an unprecedented violation of recognized international legal standards and the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. Baranovsky said that by taking these new actions, the United States was undermining the famous agreements, treaties, and obligations it had signed, in particular the Soviet-American agreement of November 16, 1933. In this agreement, the U.S. and Soviet governments mutually guaranteed not to fund or support military and other organizations that aimed to change the political or social system of the other contracting party by force.

　　Baranovsky concluded: The delegation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic supports the proposal of the delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic and requests that the representatives of all countries in the General Assembly condemn the U.S. government for organizing subversive, espionage, and sabotage activities that endanger the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, in accordance with the laws of October 10, 1951, and June 20, 1952, and recommends that the U.S. government take the necessary measures to abolish the aforementioned laws.

　　U.S. Representative Lodge, who spoke next, attempted for the third time to convince the representatives that the United States was not interfering in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

　　Polish representative Katz-Suchy asked the committee members to note that the U.S. representative's speech strongly illustrated the U.S. delegation's attempt to cover up the U.S. government's interference in the internal affairs of other countries with issues that were completely irrelevant to the issue being discussed by the committee.

　　Katz-Suchy supported the Czechoslovak proposal and urged the Political Committee to accept it. He said: If they voted in favor of the Czechoslovak proposal, the representatives could reaffirm their commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter, which prohibits interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

　　The Brazilian representative made a brief speech at the meeting, expressing opposition to the Czechoslovak proposal. The committee then adjourned the meeting.

    白俄罗斯、乌克兰和波兰等国代表在联大政委会上
    谴责美国派间谍到民主国家进行破坏活动
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：联合国大会政治委员会在二十五日继续讨论美国干涉他国内政问题。白俄罗斯、乌克兰和波兰的代表在会上发言，进一步揭露美国对苏联和人民民主国家进行颠覆破坏活动的事实和斥责美国干涉他国内政。
    在上午会议上，白俄罗斯共和国代表团团长库兹马·维·基谢列夫发言时提请委员会注意下述事实，就是：美国国会已经通过共同安全法案卡尔斯坦修正案，这个修正案规定拨款一亿美元来对苏联及人民民主国家进行颠覆性的间谍及破坏活动。这件事罪恶昭彰地违反了联合国宪章和国际法的原则。
    美国报纸公认，美国政府正在派遣间谍和专门从事破坏的匪徒渗透到人民民主国家里去。例如，美国“纽瓦克明星纪事报”的军事记者伦纳德·纳逊上校在一九五一年十二月十七日写道，他很清楚地知道美国正在铁幕后面进行间谍及破坏活动，虽然他不知道美国在这上面花了多少钱。他又说，这些大规模活动说明为什么美国特务常常被捕。基谢列夫又说，美国代表洛奇在他的发言中并没有驳倒捷克斯洛伐克和苏联代表所列举的无数事实。
    基谢列夫最后说，白俄罗斯共和国代表团完全支持捷克斯洛伐克共和国代表团的提案，并将投票赞成这个提案。
    希腊、加拿大、土耳其、哥斯达黎加、铁托南斯拉夫的代表和国民党代理人接着发言，他们说，他们将投票反对捷克斯洛伐克的提案，但他们都规避苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰和白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国代表团所引用的事实，而这些事实无可辩驳地揭露了美国干涉苏联及人民民主国家的内政。
    在下午会议上首先发言的是英国代表杰伯，他仍然规避苏联、白俄罗斯共和国和捷克斯洛伐克代表团所列举的美国在苏联和各人民民主国家进行间谍、颠覆和破坏活动的事实，并重复那些关于苏联与各人民民主国家的荒诞的捏造。
    乌克兰共和国代表团团长巴拉诺夫斯基接着发言，他强调说，美国国会通过一九五一年十月十日的法律和一九五二年六月二十日的法律，是美国干涉其他国家内政的罪恶昭彰的行为，是史无前例的违反公认的国际法标准、违反联合国宪章的原则与宗旨的行为。巴拉诺夫斯基说，美国由于采取了这些新的行动，就破坏它所签署的有名的协定、条约和它所承担的义务，特别是一九三三年十一月十六日的苏美协定。在这个协定中，美国和苏联政府互相保证不资助和支持目的在于以武力改变另一缔约国的政治或社会制度的军事及其他组织。
    巴拉诺夫斯基最后说：乌克兰共和国代表团支持捷克斯洛伐克代表团的提案，并要求大会的各国代表谴责美国政府根据一九五一年十月十日和一九五二年六月二十日的法律组织危害苏联和人民民主国家的颠覆、间谍和破坏活动，并建议美国政府采取必要的措施废除上述法律。
    跟着发言的美国代表洛奇第三次企图使代表们相信据说美国并没有干涉苏联和人民民主国家的内政。
    波兰代表卡茨—苏希请求委员会委员注意：美国代表的发言有力地说明美国代表团企图把和委员会所讨论的问题毫不相干的问题，来掩盖美国政府干涉他国内政。
    卡茨—苏希支持捷克斯洛伐克的提案，他促请政治委员会接受这一提案。他说：如果投票赞成捷克斯洛伐克的提案，代表们就可以重新表示他们忠于禁止干涉他国内政的联合国宪章的原则。
    巴西代表在会上作简短的发言，表示反对捷克斯洛伐克提案。委员会至此即宣布休会。
