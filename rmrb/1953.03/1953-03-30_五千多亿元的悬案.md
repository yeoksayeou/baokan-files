The Unresolved Case of Over 500 Billion Yuan
By our Special Correspondent Chen Xin

    In 1951, the Northeast People's Government Trade Department, without establishing a fund utilization plan or going through approval procedures, used over 500 billion yuan from the department's "internal accumulation" of "excess profits" as basic construction investment for the Northeast state-owned trade system, while also addressing employee welfare issues. The Northeast Finance Department repeatedly requested the Northeast Trade Department to submit information on the use of funds, approval procedures, and detailed final accounting materials to the Northeast Finance Department. However, even now that the Northeast People's Government organization has been reorganized into the Northeast Administrative Committee, this issue remains unresolved.
    How did the original Northeast Trade Department's "internal accumulation" of "excess profits" come about? It turns out that when the Northeast Trade Department formulated the profit plan for the Northeast trade system each year, they often set the plan very low and emphasized that it would be difficult to complete. However, at the end of each year, they were able to retain huge profits beyond the profit plan, which they called "excess profits," considering them as "internal accumulation." In 1950, their "excess profits" reached 67.41% of the planned profit. In 1951, their "excess profits" exceeded the planned profit by 222.99%.
    In 1951, the state allocated over 240 billion yuan in Renminbi to the Northeast state-owned trade system as basic construction funds. When the Northeast Trade Department allocated these funds, trade companies in various provinces and cities in the Northeast all said it was not enough, so the Northeast Trade Department decided to use the "excess profits" accumulated in 1951 and earlier to solve these problems. On May 17, 1951, the Northeast Trade Department convened representatives from trade companies in various provinces and cities to discuss the use of "internal accumulation" of "excess profits" to solve the problem of basic construction investment. According to the plans proposed by various regions, it was necessary to use 600 to 700 billion yuan of "excess profits." After compression and reduction at the meeting, it was decided to use 350 billion yuan. After the meeting, trade companies in various provinces and cities still felt it was not enough and continued to request increases. When Wang Xingrang (former Minister of the Northeast Trade Department) inspected work in Andong, he verbally approved the use of funds from "excess profits" for Liaodong Province to build a commercial middle school; when Huang Da (former Deputy Minister of the Northeast Trade Department) inspected work in Lushun-Dalian, he also verbally agreed to the use of funds from "excess profits" for Lushun-Dalian to build wharf warehouses (Lushun-Dalian used part of these funds for warehouse construction on their own authority to build dormitories); when Xiong Fei (former Deputy Minister of the Northeast Trade Department) inspected work in Harbin, he also verbally approved Songjiang Province's use of funds from "excess profits" to build hospitals and other facilities. Some specialized companies, seeing that "excess profits" could be used casually, requested the Northeast Trade Department to extract another batch of funds to solve some problems without affecting the company's profit delivery in 1951. Thus, with the consent of Xiong Fei, the former Deputy Minister of the Northeast Trade Department, and Qu Jiepu, the Director of the Planning Bureau, another 39.4 billion yuan was used. Later, the lower levels simply used "excess profits" without the approval of the Northeast Trade Department. The former Northeast District Company of China Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Corporation arbitrarily used 2.2 billion yuan, and the Northeast District Company of China Native Produce Corporation also used 11.2 billion yuan. When Xiao Tian, the Director of the Finance and Accounting Department of the Northeast Trade Department, inspected work in Songjiang, he also approved the Songjiang Provincial Department Store's use of over 4 billion yuan. The total amount of funds used for basic construction from the above-mentioned "excess profits" reached over 430 billion yuan. It is said that there are still 50 billion yuan that have not been spent and have been handed over to the Finance and Accounting Department. The waste and losses in the basic construction of the Northeast trade system are very serious. For example, the office project of the Lushun-Dalian Industrial Equipment Company was designed without good planning and without the consent of the Construction Bureau in advance, resulting in the original design being overturned. Later, the company not only did not redesign, but also did not conduct geological surveys before starting construction. After digging the foundation six meters deep, "quicksand" was discovered, but the project had to continue. The operation and management during construction were also poor, and the money was spent before one-third of the project was completed.
    In 1951, the Northeast Trade Department used 74 billion yuan of "excess profits" in the name of "solving employee welfare problems." However, the department did not use this money to solve the welfare problems of the vast number of employees in the Northeast trade system, but rather used it in large quantities by the Northeast Trade Department headquarters. In June 1952, the former Central Trade Department stipulated the employee welfare funds for state-owned trade, and the supplementary welfare funds for 1951 were also issued in this batch of welfare funds. Therefore, some people advocated handing over the 74 billion yuan used by the Northeast Trade Department in 1951 to the state treasury, but the leading cadres of the Northeast Trade Department advocated not handing it over, but distributing and using the money. Even after the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violation of laws and regulations was officially launched, on February 25, Chen Da, the Director of the Cadre Bureau, still advocated distributing the money, saying: "Mistakes were made in the past, we will review them; we cannot be criticized by both sides (meaning that we cannot be criticized by both the superiors and the subordinates), we still have to distribute it." Later, Li Yazhai, the Chief of the Welfare Section, jointly studied the matter with Director Qu Jiepu (who advocated that this money should not be distributed) and Director Chen Da, and temporarily decided "not to distribute it downwards." Director Chen Da said on February 26: "In the current struggle against bureaucracy, let's put it aside for now"; on March 2, Director Xiao Tian also said: "This money has already been written off, there is no problem."
    I believe that the original Northeast Trade Department's use of such a huge amount of "excess profits" without a fund utilization plan or approval procedures, and failure to report the use of funds to the Finance Department, is completely wrong. I suggest that the Central Finance Department and the Northeast Administrative Committee investigate this unresolved case and deal with it appropriately.

    五千多亿元的悬案
    本报特约记者  陈新
    一九五一年，东北人民政府贸易部没有订立用款计划，也没有经过批准手续，就动用了该部“内部积累”的“超额利润”五千多亿元，作为东北国营贸易系统的基本建设投资，同时解决职工的福利问题。东北财政部曾屡次请东北贸易部将动用款项的情形、批准手续及详细决算材料送给东北财政部。但直到现在，东北人民政府机构已改组成东北行政委员会，这个问题还是悬而未决。
    原东北贸易部“内部积累”的“超额利润”是怎样来的呢？原来东北贸易部每年年初制订东北贸易系统的利润计划时往往把计划订得很小，并且强调很难完成。但每年年终结算时，他们都能在利润计划以外，剩下庞大的利润，他们就把这种利润称之为“超额利润”，作为“内部积累”。一九五零年，他们的“超额利润”竟达利润计划的百分之六十七点四一。一九五一年，他们的“超额利润”比计划利润还多百分之二百二十二点九九。
    一九五一年国家拨了人民币二千四百余亿元给东北国营贸易系统，作为基本建设资金。当东北贸易部分配这批资金时，东北各省、市贸易公司都说不够用，东北贸易部就决定以一九五一年和以前“内部积累”的“超额利润”来解决这些问题。一九五一年五月十七日，东北贸易部召集各省市贸易公司代表讨论以“内部积累”的“超额利润”解决基本建设投资的问题，按各地提出的计划，需要动用“超额利润”六、七千亿元。会上经过压缩、削减，决定动用三千五百亿元。会后，各省、市贸易公司仍感不够，继续要求增加。当王兴让（原东北贸易部部长）到安东检查工作时，口头允许辽东省修建商业中学的资金，从“超额利润”中开支；黄达（原东北贸易部副部长）到旅大市检查工作时，也口头答应了旅大市建设码头仓库等需要的资金，从“超额利润”中开支（这批用作修建仓库的资金，旅大市自己作主，用了一部分修建宿舍）；熊飞（原东北贸易部副部长）到哈尔滨市检查工作时，也口头批准松江省从“超额利润”中开支修建医院等所需要的资金。有些专业公司看到“超额利润”可以随便动用，就向东北贸易部要求在不影响一九五一年公司上缴利润的原则下，再抽出一批资金来解决一部分问题。于是在原东北贸易部熊飞副部长和计划局曲介甫局长同意之下，又动用了三百九十四亿元。以后，下面干脆不经东北贸易部批准，就擅自动用“超额利润”。原中国花纱布公司东北区公司就随意动用了二十二亿元，中国土产公司东北区公司也动用了一百一十二亿元，东北贸易部财务会计处处长萧天到松江检查工作时，也批准松江省百货公司动用了四十余亿元。以上动用“超额利润”投入基本建设的资金共达四千三百多亿元。据说，还有五百亿元没有花掉，已交给财务会计处了。东北贸易系统基本建设中的浪费和损失是很严重的。如旅大市工业器材公司办公室的工程，未很好计划即进行制图，事先又未经建设局同意，结果原设计被推翻了；后来该公司不仅未另行设计，也没有进行地质勘查，就开始施工，地基打下六公尺深后发现“流沙”，但工程还要进行下去，施工中的经营管理又不好，工程未完成三分之一，就把钱花光了。
    一九五一年东北贸易部在“解决职工福利问题”的名义下，动用了“超额利润”七百四十亿元。但该部并未将这笔款解决东北贸易系统广大职工的福利问题，而是由东北贸易部本部大批动用了。一九五二年六月原中央贸易部规定了国营贸易的职工福利金，在这批福利金中也补发了一九五一年的福利基金，于是有人主张把东北贸易部一九五一年动用的七百四十亿元上缴国库，但东北贸易部的领导干部却主张不要上缴，而把这批钱分配动用了。就在反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪斗争正式开展后的二月二十五日，干部局陈达局长还是主张把这批款分下去，并说：“过去的事情错就错了，我们检讨；挨打不能两头挨（意思指不能挨了上面批评，也挨下边批评），还是要分下去。”后来福利科科长李雅斋又与曲介甫局长（曲主张此款不能往下分）、陈达局长共同研究，才暂时确定“不向下分了”。陈达局长在二月二十六日说：“现在反官僚主义斗争中，搁一搁再说”；三月二日萧天处长还说：“这批钱已报销处理了，没有问题。”
    我认为原东北贸易部既无用款计划，也没有批准手续，就动用这样庞大的“超额利润”，并且不把动用情况向财政部作交代，是完全错误的。建议中央财政部和东北行政委员会检查这个悬案，加以适当处理。
