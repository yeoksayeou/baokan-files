    Wuhan Automobile Ferry Management Office's Idle Equipment Exceeds Fixed Asset Quota by Nine Times
    Liang Lizhong writes: The state-owned Wuhan Automobile Ferry Management Office's financial revenue and expenditure plan for last year had a fixed asset quota plan of 215.00 million yuan, but in reality, idle materials alone amounted to over 2.1 billion yuan, exceeding the fixed asset quota plan by approximately nine times. The four ships abandoned by the factory were once wanted by other units for purchase; however, the office consistently refused to sell them, nor did they repair them for use, leaving them to rust. A pile of wood dismantled from the "Changyong" wooden boat in 1951, worth five to six million yuan, is still piled up on the Wuchang riverbank. Workers say: After some time, it won't even be good for firewood. I won't enumerate the other instances of idle assets!

    武汉汽车轮渡管理所呆滞器材超过定额资产九倍
    梁立中来信：国营武汉汽车轮渡管理所去年财务收支计划定额资产计划额是二亿一千五百余万元，但实际上仅呆滞材料一项就多达二十一亿元以上，超过定额资产计划额约九倍。该厂搁置的四只船，过去曾有别的单位要买；但该所一直不卖出去，也不修复使用，搁到现在都已锈烂了。一九五一年从“长永号”木船拆下来的一堆木料，价值五六百万元，到现在还堆在武昌江岸上。工人们说：再过些时候，做柴火烧也不行了。其他资产闲置情形，我就不一一说了！
