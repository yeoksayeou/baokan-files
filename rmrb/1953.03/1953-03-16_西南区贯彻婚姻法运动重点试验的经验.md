The Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, in order to prepare for the implementation of the Marriage Law this year, organized three Marriage Law inspection groups in November of last year. These groups went to Dawangjiaying Township in Chenggong County, Yunnan Province, Yongjing, Santian, and Yongyang Townships in Xifeng County, Guizhou Province, and Dafo Township in Nanbu County, Sichuan Province, to conduct key experimental work. The steps and experiences of this work, which lasted about a month, are as follows:

First, train cadres. Training cadres should achieve two requirements: 1. Enable cadres to understand the basic spirit of the Marriage Law and the nature, purpose, and direction of the movement; 2. Based on the local situation, study and formulate steps and specific methods for carrying out the movement. At the same time, the leadership should also understand the local situation of Marriage Law implementation and become familiar with the cadres.

The main method of training is to adopt short-term training classes to gather the main cadres from villages and townships for intensive training. The experience of training cadres is: focus on the cadres' ideological situation, fully explain the basic spirit of the Marriage Law and the guidelines and policies for implementing the Marriage Law, and check the implementation of the Marriage Law to inspire them to consciously criticize feudal ideas, so that cadres, from their own interests and from the responsibility of being a people's cadre, can understand and support the Marriage Law, and can correctly grasp the guidelines and policies for implementing the Marriage Law.

In addition to being basically the same as the masses in terms of feudal ideas on marriage and understanding of the Marriage Law, cadres also have concerns such as fear of being punished for problems found during inspection, fear of affecting production, and fear of disrupting central work. However, cadres are generally more aware, and as long as they are patiently educated and the policies are clearly explained, they will correct their mistakes. Then discuss the leadership's intentions and work plans with them, and enrich the plan content based on their actual experience and correct opinions. In this way, the leadership's plan will become the cadres' and masses' own plan.

Second, conduct in-depth publicity among the masses. In propaganda and education work, it is necessary to grasp three main links:

	One, the content of the propaganda must be comprehensive. The content of the propaganda should include the basic spirit of the Marriage Law and the nature and educational direction of the movement. In terms of specific content, it is also necessary to grasp a few points: When publicizing the abolition of the feudal marriage system, on the one hand, it is necessary to use local examples of deep suffering from the feudal marriage system, combined with the immediate interests of the masses, to illustrate the bloody crimes of the feudal marriage system and the serious harm it brings to families, production, and the country. Only in this way can we arouse the masses' deep hatred for the feudal marriage system. On the other hand, we must find the root of these crimes, analyze their class essence, and direct the spearhead at the feudal marriage system. Only in this way can we persuade the masses, correctly mobilize the masses, and avoid antagonism between people. While publicizing the abolition of the feudal marriage system, it must be emphasized that the purpose is to establish a new democratic marriage system, to establish a democratic, harmonious, and united productive new family, not to dismantle old families, but to transform old families into new families. This is easiest for the masses to accept; the propaganda should also explain the true meaning of freedom of marriage and equality between men and women, dispel some misunderstandings of the masses, and explain that the Marriage Law is not only beneficial to women, but also to men, not only beneficial to young people, but also to the elderly, not only beneficial to families, but also to the country. The above new and old content should be fully explained and compared to fully mobilize the masses, systematically criticize old ideas and old systems, and establish new ideas, new systems, and new customs.

	Two, propaganda cannot be generalized. The key to overcoming generalization lies in combining the specific ideas of the masses and fully explaining the policies. First, explain the policies at large and small mass meetings. After the masses have a certain understanding, hold separate forums for various people to conduct in-depth mobilization. Specific experience is: when mobilizing the elderly, especially mothers-in-law, it is mainly necessary to have them recall the suffering they personally suffered from feudal marriage in the past, inspire their enthusiasm to oppose the feudal marriage system, and at the same time explain the correct relationship between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law; after they improve their understanding, they can generally consciously participate in the movement and sympathize with and support the just struggle of young men and women. Du Guolian's mother in Dafo Township was initially dissatisfied with the Marriage Law. After she found the root of her pain and understood the correct relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, she not only actively mobilized her son to come out to study, but also told her daughter-in-law the benefits of the Marriage Law at night.

	Young people are generally easy to accept new things and demand freedom of marriage, but they do not deeply feel the pain of feudal marriage. Unmarried people are not very concerned, and married people also have concerns. Therefore, they should be fully aware of the crimes of the old marriage system and the happiness of the new marriage, and combine the explanation of the responsibilities and future of young people. After clarifying the principles, they can play an active role in propaganda work. However, due to their different positions in the family, they cannot be generally called upon to take the lead, because that would often isolate young people in the family. Therefore, they must be allowed to play an appropriate role according to each person's specific situation. Forcing them to take the lead in holding family meetings often makes the problem even more rigid.

	Mobilizing men is an important task. At the beginning, some cadres believed that the implementation of the Marriage Law was to abolish the rule of husband's power, and men would definitely not be able to understand it. However, experience has proven that as long as the Marriage Law can be correctly explained, explaining that the Marriage Law is not only beneficial to women, but also to men, women, the elderly, and the young, and making men correctly realize the labor wisdom of women and their painful lives under the feudal marriage system, it is possible to change the idea of male superiority to female inferiority. The working group also used the method of detailed accounting to specifically illustrate the harm of the feudal marriage system to families and production. However, the detailed accounting cannot treat family economic losses as only the man suffering, so that men will still "cherish" their wives with the view of treating private property. At the same time, it is also necessary to be good at making the masses combine their personal family interests with the national interests.

	Mobilizing women is a very important task in the movement. Without paying attention to this, the movement cannot be deepened, and the problem cannot be solved well. Women suffer more deeply than men. After they recognize the root of their personal pain and understand the true meaning of freedom of marriage and equality between men and women, they will break the fate and inferiority views and automatically rise up to solve family disputes and marriage problems. Women should be emphasized to mobilize, but it is not equal to mobilizing women in isolation, but mobilizing women in the mobilization of men, women, the elderly, and the young together.

	The entire movement is an inseparable educational process. According to the steps of the movement and the development of the masses' thinking, the general procedure is: first, publicize the basic spirit of the Marriage Law, so that the masses first understand the basic spirit of the Marriage Law in principle, and then combine the criticism of the wrong understanding of the Marriage Law. Only after the masses feel the benefits of the Marriage Law from their own interests, it is possible to automatically combine their existing feudal ideological behavior in marriage issues for criticism. At this time, the ideological situation of the masses is complex and changeable, and propaganda and education work must be more patient and meticulous.

	Three, rely on local activists and use various methods to conduct publicity. Propaganda should be comprehensive and combined with the ideas of the masses. This spirit can be well reflected only after it is mastered by grassroots cadres and activists among the masses. The inspection group has done the following work in this regard: one is to conduct regular political and ideological education work to make them full of political enthusiasm; one is to strengthen specific leadership in the work, solve difficulties in the work through research and discussion of actual work, and improve their working ability. In addition, taking care of their production and life and dividing the work well. To solve these problems, it is also necessary to strengthen the education of the mass viewpoint of each comrade of the inspection group and prevent the work style of taking over everything.

	The whole set of propaganda institutions was used in the propaganda, and various propaganda methods were used, with great momentum. However, the content of the propaganda must be controlled, and the content of the propaganda should be uniformly arranged with the development of the movement in order to better promote the movement.

Third, resolve family disputes at the spontaneous request of the masses. After extensive and in-depth publicity and education, the main members of the family realized the benefits of the Marriage Law from their own interests, and therefore consciously rose up to request the resolution of their own family problems, the inspection group began to resolve family disputes among the masses.

	The method of resolution is generally to conduct discussions in units of mutual aid groups and resident groups. Because general rural cadres and activists have a higher level of awareness after propaganda and training, they often take the lead in requesting the resolution of family disputes. For example, Cai Hengxiao, the leader of the mutual aid group in Dafo Township, Nanbu County, Sichuan Province, had been at odds with his wife for many years. Cai arranged a marriage for his son, and his daughter-in-law had not spoken to his son for three years. This time, after propaganda and education, the whole family's awareness was improved, and they automatically requested the resolution of family problems, untied the "old knot" of many years, and united harmoniously. The masses said, "The Marriage Law is really good," and also asked to solve their own family problems. In this way, problems can be helped to be resolved at the courtyard meeting and family meeting according to the voluntary request of the masses.

	The method of resolution is mainly to expose the problem and recognize the problem, and formulate a covenant. The exposure and recognition of the problem itself is the common accusation of the crimes of the feudal marriage system and the criticism of their feudal remnant ideological behavior by the main members of the whole family under the slogan of opposing the feudal marriage system and establishing a new democratic marriage system. The formulation of the covenant is to consciously put forward the establishment of a democratic, harmonious, and united new family by the masses according to the spirit of the Marriage Law at the end of the Marriage Law implementation movement, that is, to guide the production enthusiasm and political enthusiasm of the masses to patriotic production increase and social activities, and at the same time, consolidate and develop the results of the Marriage Law implementation movement through the form of family covenants.

	Most of the problems exposed in this movement were solved through the above methods. A small number of problems that were difficult to solve in group meetings, such as divorce and bringing property, were resolved through mediation by the township mediation committee. Only a very small number of serious criminals who interfered with freedom of marriage, abused women, and caused murder and personal injury were handed over to the court for punishment according to law.

Fourth, summarize the gains of the movement and commend models. In the later stage of the movement, the movement should be summarized among the masses in order to further improve the masses' understanding of the Marriage Law and consolidate the results of the movement. The content of the summary is mainly: what achievements have been made through the movement? What problems have been solved? Such a summary of achievements can enable the masses to be confirmed from the facts: the Marriage Law is indeed for family harmony, democratic unity, improving social productivity, and establishing new social ethics, which is beneficial to the people, the country, and future generations. At the same time, it should further guide the masses to realize that this is the result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, so that the masses can trust, support, and love the Communist Party and Chairman Mao more, actively implement the party's policies, and consciously abide by various laws and regulations of the government.

	The method of summary is to conduct mass summaries from bottom to top, so that it can be practical and specific, and the scope of education is also large.

	In the summary, it is also necessary to establish and improve various organizations and work systems, and study future work, so that it can become a force for regularly implementing the Marriage Law in the future.

	On the basis of summarizing the movement, commending models and establishing banners among the masses is a very good positive education. But it can't be rash.

    西南区贯彻婚姻法运动重点试验的经验
    西南军政委员会为了给今年贯彻婚姻法做好准备，在去年十一月间组成三个婚姻法检查组，分赴云南省呈贡县大王家营乡，贵州省息烽县永靖、三田、永阳三乡及四川省南部县大佛乡作重点试验工作。历时一月左右，其进行步骤和经验如下：
    第一，训练干部。训练干部要达到两个要求：一、使干部领会婚姻法的基本精神及运动的性质、目的和方针；二、根据当地情况研究订出开展运动的步骤和具体做法。同时，领导方面还应从中了解当地贯彻婚姻法的情况，熟悉干部。
    训练的办法主要是采用短期训练班的方式，集训乡村的主要干部。训练干部的经验是：要针对干部思想情况，全面讲解婚姻法的基本精神和贯彻婚姻法的方针政策，并检查执行婚姻法的情况，启发他们自觉地批判封建思想，使干部从切身利益上，从做一个人民干部的责任上，认识和拥护婚姻法，并能正确掌握贯彻婚姻法的方针政策。
    干部在婚姻问题上的封建思想和对婚姻法的认识，除基本上与群众相同外，他们还有怕检查出问题来受处分、怕影响生产、怕打乱中心工作等顾虑。但干部的觉悟一般比较高，只要耐心教育，交代清楚政策，他们就会改正错误。然后把领导意图、工作计划和他们商量，根据他们的实际经验和正确意见，充实计划内容，这样，领导的计划便会成为干部、群众自己的计划。
    第二，向群众进行深入宣传。在宣传教育工作中要掌握三个主要环节：
      一、宣传内容必须全面。宣传内容要包括婚姻法的基本精神及运动的性质和教育方针这几个主要方面。在具体内容上还要掌握几点：在宣传废除封建婚姻制度时，一方面必须运用当地深受封建婚姻制度痛苦的事例，结合群众的切身利益，说明封建婚姻制度的血腥罪恶，给家庭、生产和国家带来的严重危害。只有这样，才能引起群众对封建婚姻制度的深恶痛绝。另一方面，又必须找出这些罪恶的根子，分析其阶级实质，把矛头对准封建婚姻制度。只有这样，才能说服群众，正确地发动群众，避免人与人的对立。在宣传废除封建婚姻制度的同时，必须着重指出其目的是为了建立新民主主义婚姻制度，建立民主和睦、团结生产的新家庭，不是要拆散旧家庭，而是要改造旧家庭为新家庭。这样最易为群众接受；在宣传中还要讲明婚姻自由、男女平等的真正意义，解除群众的一些误解，说明婚姻法不仅对妇女有利，对男子也有利，不仅对青年有利，对老人也有利，不仅对家庭有利，而且对国家也有利。以上的新旧内容，应全面讲，对比着讲，才能全面发动群众，系统地批判旧思想、旧制度，树立新思想、新制度、新风气。
    二、宣传不能一般化。克服一般化的关键，在于结合群众的具体思想，全面交代政策。先在大小群众会上交代政策，待群众有一定认识后，即分别召开各种人的座谈会，进行深入动员。具体经验是：发动老年人特别是发动婆婆时，主要是要她回忆过去亲身遭受的封建婚姻的痛苦，启发其反对封建婚姻制度的积极性，同时讲清婆媳之间的正确关系；她们提高认识之后，一般都能自觉地参加运动，同情和支持青年男女的正义斗争。大佛乡杜国莲的母亲开始时不满婚姻法，当她找到自己痛苦的根源和懂得了正确的婆媳关系后，不但积极动员儿子出来学习，并在晚上给媳妇讲婚姻法的好处。
    青年人一般容易接受新鲜事物，要求婚姻自由，但对封建婚姻的痛苦感受不深，未婚的不太关心，已婚的也有顾虑。因此，应让他们充分认识旧婚姻制度的罪恶，新婚姻的幸福，并结合讲解青年的责任和前途，讲清楚道理之后，他们都能在宣传工作中发挥积极的作用。但由于他们在家庭中的地位不同，不能笼统地号召他们起带头作用，因为那样往往会使青年在家庭中陷于孤立，所以必须按每个人的具体情况让他们发挥适当的作用。如果生硬地布置他们带头去开家庭会，往往把问题弄得更僵。
    发动男子是件重要的工作。开始，有的干部认为贯彻婚姻法是要废除夫权统治，男子一定想不通。但经验证明，只要能够正确地讲婚姻法，说明婚姻法不只对妇女有利，对男、女、老、少都有利，并使男子正确地认识到妇女的劳动智慧和在封建婚姻制度下的痛苦生活后，是能够改变男尊女卑的思想的。工作组还用了算细账的方法，具体说明封建婚姻制度对家庭和生产的危害。但算细账不能把家庭经济损失只当男方吃亏，那样男子会仍以看待私产的观点来“爱护”妻子。同时，还要善于使群众把个人家庭利益与国家利益结合起来。
    发动妇女是运动中很重要的工作。不重视这点，运动就不能深入，问题就解决不好。妇女的痛苦比男人更深，在她们认清切身痛苦的根子，认识婚姻自由、男女平等的真实意义后，便会打破命运、自卑观点，自动起来解决家庭纠纷和婚姻问题。妇女要着重发动，但不等于孤立地去发动妇女，而是在男女老少一齐发动中去发动妇女。
    整个运动是不可分割的教育过程。根据运动的步骤和群众思想发展来看，一般程序是：首先进行婚姻法的基本精神的宣传，使群众首先从道理上懂得婚姻法的基本精神，然后联系批判对婚姻法的错误认识。只有在群众从切身利益上感到婚姻法的好处后，才可能自动联系自己在婚姻问题上存在的封建思想行为进行批判。这时群众的思想情况错综复杂，宣传教育工作要更加耐心细致。
    三、依靠当地积极分子，运用各种方式进行宣传。宣传要全面，要结合群众思想，这个精神只有为基层干部和群众中的积极分子掌握后，才能很好地体现。检查组在这方面曾做了以下几项工作：一是进行经常的政治思想教育工作，使他们政治热情饱满；一是加强工作中的具体领导，通过对实际工作的研究讨论，解决工作中的困难，提高他们的工作能力。另外，照顾到他们的生产和生活，很好地分工。要解决这些问题又须加强对检查组每个同志的群众观点的教育，防止包办代替作风。
    在宣传中运用了全套宣传机构，使用了多种多样的宣传方式，声势浩大。但宣传内容要控制，而且要随着运动的发展统一布置宣传内容，以便更好地推动运动。
    第三，在群众自动要求下解决家庭纠纷。在广泛深入地进行宣传教育后，家庭的主要成员，从切身利益体会到婚姻法的好处，因而自觉地起来要求解决自己家庭的问题时，检查组才开始在群众中解决家庭纠纷。
    解决的方式，一般是以互助组和居民小组为单位进行座谈。由于一般乡村干部和积极分子经过宣传和训练后觉悟较高，往往首先起来要求解决家庭纠纷。如四川省南部县大佛乡互助组长蔡恒孝夫妻多年不和，蔡给他儿子包办了婚姻，媳妇与儿子三年没说过话，这次经过宣传教育，一家觉悟都提高了，自动要求解决家庭问题，解开了多年的“老疙瘩”，团结和睦了。群众说“婚姻法硬是好”，也要求解决自己家庭的问题。这样，就可根据群众的自愿，在院子会、家庭会上帮助解决问题。
    解决的方法，主要是暴露问题和认识问题，订立公约。暴露和认识问题的本身，就是全家主要成员在反对封建婚姻制度、建立新民主主义婚姻制度的口号下共同起来控诉封建婚姻制度的罪恶和批判自己的封建残余思想行为。订立公约，就是在贯彻婚姻法运动告一段落时，根据婚姻法的精神，由群众自觉地提出建立民主和睦、团结生产的新家庭，也就是把群众的生产热情和政治热情引导到爱国增产和社会活动上来，同时也是把贯彻婚姻法运动的成果通过家庭公约的形式加以巩固和发展。
    这次运动中揭发出来的问题，大多数都是通过上述方法解决的。一小部分在小组会上难以解决的问题，如离婚和带产等，是通过乡调解委员会调解解决的。只有极少数因干涉婚姻自由、虐待妇女而致杀害人命、伤害人身的严重犯罪分子，才送交法院依法惩处。
    第四，总结运动收获，表扬模范。运动后期，要在群众中对运动进行总结，以便进一步提高群众对婚姻法的认识，巩固运动成果。总结的内容主要是：通过运动取得了那些成绩？解决了那些问题？这样总结成绩后，可使群众从事实上得到证实：婚姻法确实是为了家庭和睦，民主团结，提高社会生产力，建立社会新道德，对人民、对国家、对子孙后代都是有利的。同时，还应进一步引导群众认识这都是共产党和毛主席正确领导的结果，从而使群众更加信任、拥护和热爱共产党和毛主席，积极起来执行党的政策，自觉地遵守政府的各种法令。
    总结的方法，是自下而上地进行群众性的总结，这样才能实际具体，教育范围也大。
    在总结中，还应建立与健全各种组织与工作制度，并研究今后工作，使之成为今后经常贯彻执行婚姻法的力量。
    在总结运动的基础上，进行表扬模范，在群众中树立旗帜，是很好的正面教育。但不能草率。
