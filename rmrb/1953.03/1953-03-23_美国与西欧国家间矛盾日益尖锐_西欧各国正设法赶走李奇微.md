Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: Contradictions between Western European countries and the United States are intensifying. According to a United Press dispatch from Paris on the 16th, some Western European governments are conducting concerted actions to try to relieve Ridgway of his position as Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The arrogant and arbitrary attitude of the American proconsul in Western Europe, Ridgway, and his subordinates toward the governments and officers of Western European countries has aroused strong dissatisfaction among the governments and officers of Western European countries. Western European bourgeois newspapers have been constantly reporting on this matter in recent months. The British "Observer" said in January of this year that it was believed that Ridgway "seems to have lost the ability to cooperate with allies." Ridgway's relationship with non-American personnel in his headquarters and under his command is not close enough. Throughout the Supreme Headquarters of the North Atlantic Army and the main agencies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Paris, one can clearly hear disputes about "whether Ridgway is qualified to be the Supreme Commander."

"Paris News" also published news in February about the strong dissatisfaction of Western European officers in the North Atlantic Army Headquarters with the arrogant attitude of American officers. The news said that many Western European officers, especially British officers, have asked their governments to transfer them elsewhere "because friction that deteriorates the atmosphere has occurred in the Allied Headquarters." Western European officers accused the American Headquarters, especially Ridgway, of lacking "political skills."

The aforementioned United Press dispatch of March 16 stated that senior American officials have recently conducted an "informal investigation" into the activities of Western European countries against Ridgway. The investigation concluded that "the situation is alarming" and Ridgway is in a difficult position. These officials stated that the U.S. government will take measures to "curb" this activity.

    美国与西欧国家间矛盾日益尖锐
    西欧各国正设法赶走李奇微
    【新华社二十二日讯】西欧国家与美国间的矛盾正在日益尖锐。据合众社巴黎十六日电说：有些西欧国家政府正在进行一致活动，设法免除李奇微担任北大西洋军总司令。
    美国驻西欧总督李奇微及其僚属对西欧国家政府及军官所采取的蛮横专断的态度，遭到了西欧国家政府及军官的强烈不满。西欧资产阶级报纸在最近几个月来不断地报道着这方面的消息。英国“观察家报”在今年一月间说：大家认为李奇微“似乎已经失去了和盟国合作的本领”。李奇微和他的司令部内的以及他所统辖的非美国人员间的关系是不够密切的。在北大西洋军最高司令部和在巴黎的北大西洋公约组织各主要机构中，到处都可以清楚地听到关于“李奇微是否有资格担任最高司令”的争吵。
        “巴黎急进新闻”在二月间也刊载了北大西洋军司令部中西欧军官强烈不满美国军官傲慢态度的消息。消息说：许多西欧军官，特别是英国军官，都要求他们本国政府把他们调到别的地方去，“因为盟军司令部内发生了使气氛恶化的摩擦”。西欧军官们指责美国司令部，特别是李奇微，说他缺乏“政治手腕”。
    上述合众社三月十六日的消息说：美国高级官员最近已对西欧国家反对李奇微的活动作了“非正式调查”，调查结果认为“局势是惊人的”，李奇微处境窘迫。这些官员表示，美国政府要采取措施来
    “遏止”这种活动。
