Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: Tokyo dispatch: The Yoshida government, which had brutally persecuted the Japanese Communist Party and other patriotic candidates in the previous election, is now plotting to intensify its interference in the election activities of patriotic individuals in the upcoming election.

Following the announcement of the dissolution of the Diet and the scheduling of new elections in April, the National Local Police Headquarters convened a meeting of the investigation section chiefs of national police agencies on the 19th to make specific arrangements for suppressing the election activities of patriotic individuals. The meeting decided that the election activities of progressive labor unions, farmers' associations, and parties would be severely suppressed under the pretext of "harassment" and "destructive activities."

The Yoshida government's Ministry of Justice also convened a meeting of national chief prosecutors on the 20th, where Minister of Justice Ken Inukai instructed the national suppression agencies to step up preparations for suppressing patriotic candidates. Chief Prosecutor-General Fujisato Sato also ordered the heads of national prosecutorial agencies to "personally direct the crackdown on (patriotic candidates') election activities."

Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: Tokyo dispatch: After the Japanese Diet passed a vote of no confidence in the Yoshida Cabinet and the Liberal Party officially split, the Yoshida group is desperately seeking assistance from Japanese monopoly capitalists, attempting to continue to obtain their strong support and once again rely on fraudulent means to seize power in the election with large amounts of campaign funds.

Yoshida hosted a tea party on the 20th, inviting more than 130 leading figures from business and finance, including Taizo Ishizaka, the general manager of Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company, and Kyonosuke Sakai, the chairman of the Japanese Bankers Association. According to Kyodo News, Yoshida plans to invite major capitalists from Tokyo, Yokohama, Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, and Kyushu regions for talks starting from the 20th, asking for their understanding of the Diet's dissolution and for "assistance" in the election.

International News Service acknowledged that Yoshida's "government was able to win the victory in the October election last year mainly because large industrial and commercial groups generously donated campaign funds." However, the passage of a vote of no confidence in the Yoshida Cabinet by the Diet, resulting in its dissolution, has thwarted the Yoshida government's policy of directly serving Japanese monopoly capital. Japanese monopoly capitalists have been greatly disappointed by this. Aiichiro Fujiyama, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, stated after Yoshida dissolved the Diet that the Japanese financial world was very disappointed with Yoshida "because this party clearly lacks the ability to stabilize the political situation." Faced with the difficult situation of the Liberal Party being split and no party being likely to obtain a majority in the Diet, the leaders of the "Federation of Economic Organizations," an organization of Japanese monopoly capitalists, held a meeting on the 17th to discuss the issue of election investment. Sources revealed that Japanese monopoly capital groups are using campaign funds as a weapon to exert pressure on the main bourgeois parties, demanding that they "guarantee" the "formation of a conservative government from the election."

    吉田政府布置爪牙进行迫害活动
    干涉爱国候选人竞选
    【新华社二十四日讯】东京消息：在上次大选中曾对日本共产党和其他爱国的候选人横加迫害的吉田政府，正阴谋在这次大选中变本加厉地干涉爱国人士的竞选活动。
    吉田政府在宣布解散国会并定于四月重新举行大选之后，国家地方警察本部在十九日即召集全国警察机关的搜查课长举行会议，就镇压爱国人士的竞选活动作了具体的布置。会议决定：对进步的工会、农会和党派的竞选活动，都假借“骚扰”和“破坏活动”的名义加以严厉的镇压。
    吉田政府法务省接着也在二十日召集全国的检察长举行会议，法务相犬养健在会上训令全国的镇压机关要加紧做好对爱国候选人的镇压准备。检事总长佐藤藤佐并命令全国检察机关的负责人“要亲自指挥取缔（爱国候选人的）竞选活动”。
    【新华社二十三日讯】东京消息：在日本国会通过对吉田内阁的不信任案和自由党内部正式分裂之后，吉田集团正竭力向日本的垄断资本家求援，企图继续取得他们的大力支持，以大笔竞选资金再次靠舞弊手段在大选中取得政权。
    吉田曾在二十日举行茶会招待东京芝浦电气公司总经理石坂泰三、日本全国银行协会联合会主席酒井杏之助等实业界和金融界的首脑人物一百三十多人。据共同社报道，吉田计划从二十日起分别邀请东京、横滨、京都、大阪、神户、九州地区的大资本家会谈，请求他们谅解这次解散国会的事件，并在大选中“予以协助”。
    国际新闻社的消息承认：吉田“政府所以能够在去年十月大选中获得胜利，主要是由于大的工业和商业团体慷慨捐出了竞选经费”。但是，由于国会通过对吉田内阁的不信任案而被解散，已使吉田政府推行直接为日本垄断资本服务的政策受到挫折。日本垄断资本家已因此而大失所望。日本商工会议所会长藤山爱一郎在吉田解散国会之后表示，日本金融界对吉田很失望，“因为这个党显然没有能力使政局稳定下来。”针对着自由党陷于分裂、而且难望有一个政党能在国会中获得多数的困难局面，日本垄断资本家的组织“经济团体联合会”的首脑们曾在十七日举行会议，商讨大选投资的问题。消息透露，日本垄断资本集团正以竞选资金为武器，对各主要资产阶级政党运用压力，要他们“保证”“从大选中产生一个保守政府”。
