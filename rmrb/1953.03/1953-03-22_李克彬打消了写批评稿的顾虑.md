    Li Kebin Dispels Concerns About Writing Critical Articles
    Li Kebin from the Machine Repair Workshop of the State-owned Jilin No. 3 Paper Mill writes: After reading the People's Daily editorial of January 19th, "Earnestly Handle Letters from the People, Boldly Expose Bureaucratic Evils," I dispelled my concerns about writing critical articles for the newspaper. Regarding the issue of Dr. Lü Delin, a surgeon at our factory's clinic, being irresponsible towards patients, after more than ten days of consideration, I finally wrote a critical article for the Jilin Daily. At the same time, I recalled that in October of last year, I wrote an article for the Northeast Daily entitled "Streetlights Should Be Installed on the Road from Jilin City Suburbs to Hadawan." After the newspaper forwarded it to the Jilin Municipal People's Government for handling, streetlights were installed there at the end of November last year, according to my suggestion. The General Office of the Jilin Municipal People's Government even wrote to me about the handling of that matter. The workers in the workshop were extremely happy when they saw that letter. This also greatly encouraged me. From now on, I will dispel all my concerns, and in addition to making suggestions, I will also boldly expose all bad people and bad deeds.

### 李克彬打消了写批评稿的顾虑

专栏：读者来信摘要

    李克彬打消了写批评稿的顾虑
    国营吉林第三造纸厂机修车间李克彬来信：读一月十九日人民日报社论“认真处理人民群众来信，大胆揭发官僚主义罪恶”后，我打消了向报社写批评稿的顾虑。如我厂医务所外科医生吕德林对患者不负责任的问题，我经过十多天的考虑，终于写了批评稿给吉林日报。同时，我又回想起去年十月间我给东北日报写的“吉林市郊区往哈达湾去的马路应安装电灯”一稿，经报社转请吉林市人民政府处理，结果去年十一月底就按照我的意见在该地安装了电灯。吉林市人民政府办公厅还把处理那件事的情况写信告诉我。车间职工们看见那封信时，都高兴极了。这也大大地鼓舞了我。今后，我更要打消一切顾虑，除了提建议，还要大胆揭发一切坏人坏事。
