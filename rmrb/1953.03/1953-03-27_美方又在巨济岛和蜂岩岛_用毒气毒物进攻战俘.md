Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 26th: On March 23rd and 24th, the US side again used poison gas and toxic substances to attack prisoners of war, shooting and wounding three prisoners of war and causing a large number of prisoners of war to be harmed by toxic substances. This is the news revealed by the American news agency. According to reports:

　　On the 24th, the US side dispatched a large number of troops to enter the No. 1 prisoner of war camp on Geoje Island to conduct a so-called "routine search," shooting and wounding three prisoners of war and releasing poison gas on the prisoners of war.

　　On the same day, US personnel arrested prisoners of war in the Beongam Island prisoner of war camp, insisting that they were "engaged in sabotage activities." When the prisoners of war "lined up and sang songs" to protest this US atrocity, the US side used so-called "irritants" with extremely poisonous substances on the prisoners of war. However, the heroic and unyielding prisoners of war still "stood in their original formation without dispersing," and the US soldiers "drove into the camp and drove them out," more cruelly attacking them with toxic substances, resulting in 80 percent of the prisoners of war being harmed by the toxic substances, while the US side did not give them any treatment.

　　On the 23rd, the US side used poison gas in the same way to attack prisoners of war, suppressing the prisoners of war's protests.

　　After carrying out these cruel means, the US side shamelessly said that the prisoners of war were trying to "force the Allied guards to take more severe measures." This shows that the US side will further massacre prisoners of war under various pretexts in the future.

　　Sources here pointed out that these three incidents, as well as a series of similar incidents that have recently occurred in US prisoner of war camps, prove that the US side is using poison gas and toxic substances to murder prisoners of war who firmly demand repatriation. After injuring prisoners of war with poison gas and toxic substances, the US side does not give them treatment, attempting to make them painfully become disabled or die. This is an extremely vicious conspiracy by the US side.

    美方又在巨济岛和蜂岩岛
    用毒气毒物进攻战俘
    【新华社开城二十六日电】三月二十三日和二十四日，美方又用毒气和有毒物质进攻战俘，开枪打伤战俘三名，并使大批战俘受到有毒物质的伤害。这是美国的通讯社透露出来的消息。据报道说：
    二十四日，美方派遣大批部队进入巨济岛第一号战俘营进行所谓“日常搜查”，开枪打伤战俘三名，并对战俘施放毒气。
    同一天，美方人员在蜂岩岛战俘营中逮捕战俘，硬说他们“进行破坏活动”。当战俘“排队唱歌”，抗议美方这种暴行时，美方就对战俘使用了有剧毒的所谓“刺激物”。但是英勇不屈的战俘们仍然“站着原队形不散”，美方士兵就“开入营场把他们赶出来”，更加残忍地用毒物进攻他们，以致有百分之八十的战俘受到毒物的伤害，而美方却不给他们以任何治疗。
    二十三日，美方曾经用毒气同样地进攻战俘，镇压战俘的抗议。
    美方在施行这些残忍的手段后，竟然无耻地说这是战俘企图“迫使联军看守兵采取更严厉的措施”。这表明美方今后将进一步以种种借口屠杀战俘。
    此间人士指出，这三次事件以及最近发生在美方战俘营中的一系列类似事件，证明美方正在用毒气和有毒物质谋害坚决要求遣返的战俘。美方在用毒气和毒物使战俘受伤以后，不给他们治疗，企图使他们痛苦地成为残废或死亡。这是美方恶毒已极的阴谋。
