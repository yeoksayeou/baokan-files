    No Randomly Pulling Teachers into Social Activities
    Randomly pulling middle school and primary school teachers into social activities is a widespread and serious phenomenon in various regions. This phenomenon is even more prominent in small cities and vast rural areas. There, many teachers often suspend classes to participate in extra-curricular central tasks, rush tasks, and other social activities, even being pulled into government offices to "help," unable to return to school for long periods. This affects the completion of teaching plans, the teachers' political study and professional development, and the improvement of teaching quality, causing losses to the long-term cause of cultivating talent for the country.
    To overcome this unhealthy phenomenon, it is necessary to educate cadres – primarily county and district cadres – and clarify their confused thinking regarding education work. Some people believe that education work is dispensable, saying things like "As long as the central task is done well, it doesn't matter if the school collapses." These comrades do not understand the correct relationship between education work and the overall national construction cause, nor do they understand the people's increasingly urgent demands in terms of culture and education. They often cite the saying "The central task overrides everything" to cover up their erroneous view of belittling education work. What does the saying "The central task overrides everything" mean? It means that we should correctly arrange various tasks (including education work, of course), strengthen the planning of work, so as to distinguish between priorities and concentrate efforts on doing the most central work well; but at the same time, we must resolutely oppose the "single fight" style of work, oppose carrying out the central task in isolation regardless of or abandoning other work. We can only have one most central task in a certain period of time, and beyond the most central task, there are bound to be second and third-tier tasks. We must place various tasks in appropriate positions because various tasks are closely related. Without the close cooperation of various tasks, it is impossible to truly do the central task well.
    Currently, one of our central tasks is to carry out large-scale economic construction. To accomplish this task, we must cultivate a large number of construction talents. Comrade Stalin said in "Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R.": "No task, especially such a huge task as the industrialization of our country, can be accomplished without energetic people, without new people, without new construction cadres." To cultivate a large number of construction talents, we must run schools well, first universities and colleges, and then middle and primary schools, because middle and primary school education is the foundation of the people's education. Some people say that cultivating industrial construction talents is the business of universities and colleges, and has nothing to do with middle and primary schools, especially primary schools. This view is incorrect. We must not only cultivate high-level industrial construction talents, but also cultivate mid-level industrial construction talents. Therefore, we must run secondary technical schools well. As for the significance of running ordinary middle schools well, it is also very obvious because it must continuously send students to universities and colleges. The decline in the teaching quality of some middle schools has already caused difficulties for university teaching. This lesson can never be repeated. As for primary school education, its relationship with the cultivation of construction talents may not seem so direct on the surface; but "it takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to cultivate a person." Cultivating talent is a long-term cause, and primary school education is basic education. If we cannot run primary school education well, we will see the consequences in a few years, so we must look to the distant future. Moreover, primary school education is most closely related to the masses. In places where the chaos in schools has developed seriously, parents have already expressed dissatisfaction, and some even have doubts about the Party and the People's Government's cultural and educational policies. Our cadres must be vigilant about the danger of being divorced from the masses on this issue, resolutely correct the erroneous view of belittling education work, and run the education cause well.
    Some comrades, under the pretext of "integrating education with politics and with reality," randomly pull teachers and students into social activities. This is completely wrong. The purpose of teachers and students participating in social activities should be to coordinate with teaching. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out in the "Resolution on Measures for Eliminating Overloads of Students in Social Work and Other Non-Study Work": "The correct arrangement of students' extracurricular work should be subordinate to the school's teaching tasks, help students to successfully carry out their studies, and help the school to cultivate all-round, active builders of communist society." Because teaching is the school's basic task, the teacher's main responsibility is to do a good job in teaching, and the basic mode of school education is classroom teaching. Therefore, teachers and students must never be used as so-called "mobile cadres" or work teams, so as not to hinder teaching or their health and necessary rest. And the organization of teachers and students to participate in social activities can only be uniformly responsible by the education department, the New Democratic Youth League, and the education trade union or teachers' federation, as well as the student union. No other organs or groups can directly mobilize teachers and students to participate in social activities.
    Some people ask, how should we grasp the measure of integrating school education with practice without hindering teaching and the health of teachers and students? There must be strict restrictions on time here, that is, the time for teachers to participate in social activities should not exceed twelve hours per month during the semester, and should not exceed one-sixth of the entire holiday during winter and summer vacations. As for the time for students to participate in social activities, the Government Administration Council stipulated as early as August 6, 1951, in the "Decision on Improving the Health of Students at All Levels of Schools": students in universities and senior secondary schools should not exceed three hours per week per person; students in junior secondary schools should not exceed two hours per week per person; and students in primary schools should not exceed one and a half hours per week per person. These regulations must be strictly implemented in various places and must not be violated. In order to ensure the smooth progress of teaching work, teachers and students are not allowed to be mobilized to participate in social activities during teaching time. If there are special needs, it must be approved by the municipal people's government or the special commissioner's office. This is the boundary. Exceeding this boundary is wrong.
    Of course, in the process of correcting the random mobilization of teachers and students to participate in social activities, we must never allow teachers and students to have any vague understanding of the principle that "education must be integrated with practice," so as to cause phenomena of belittling politics, being divorced from reality, teaching behind closed doors, and studying behind closed doors. Lenin taught in "The Tasks of the Youth Leagues": "We do not believe in teaching, training and education if it is confined only to the schoolroom and divorced from the real life seething around us." "Only by closely linking each step in the activities of the schools, by closely linking each step in training, education and schooling, with the struggle of all the working people against the exploiters, is it possible to learn." In the past, some places did not have a sufficient understanding of these principles, and made one-sided propaganda when correcting the phenomenon of randomly pulling teachers to participate in social activities, which led to a vague understanding among some teachers and students. This lesson must be avoided this time.
    To completely correct the phenomenon of randomly mobilizing teachers to participate in social activities, it is also necessary to overcome the attitude of some Party and government organs of ostensibly complying with but actually opposing the instructions of higher authorities. In 1951, the leading organs of several greater administrative areas issued relevant instructions, but some organs did not seriously arrange work accordingly, and even more did not promptly check the implementation. For example, the provincial people's government of one province issued instructions in early January 1952, saying that the chaos in schools was widespread and must be corrected; nearly a year later, at the end of December 1952, it issued instructions again, still saying that the chaos in schools was widespread and must be corrected. This shows that the provincial people's government there did not responsibly solve the problem, so the situation there did not change. As for the mistakes of some county-level cadres, they are even more serious. They openly knowingly commit violations, and even after their erroneous behavior is criticized by the newspaper, they still resist criticism and persist in their mistakes, saying that "the newspaper only cares about criticism, and teachers should still be pulled to engage in rush work, and they still have to be pulled." This serious phenomenon of lack of organization and discipline is obviously inseparable from the unserious attitude of some provincial leading organs towards the instructions of higher authorities. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to correct this attitude. Party and government organs in various places must fully estimate the important significance of this work and be sure to do it well.

### 不许乱拉教师参加社会活动

    不许乱拉教师参加社会活动
    乱拉中学和小学教师参加社会活动，是各地普遍存在着的严重现象。这种现象，在小城市和广大乡村更加突出。在那里，许多教师时常停课参加校外的中心工作和突击性的工作以及其他的社会活动，甚至被拉到机关里去“帮忙”，长时间不能回校，影响了教学计划的完成，影响了教师的政治学习和业务进修以及教学质量的提高，给国家培养人材的长远事业造成损失。
    要克服这种不健康的现象，必须向干部——主要是县区干部进行教育，澄清他们在教育工作方面的混乱思想。有些人认为教育工作是可有可无的，说什么“只要把中心工作做好，学校垮了台也不要紧”。这些同志不了解教育工作和整个国家建设事业的正确关系，也不了解群众在文化教育方面日益迫切的要求。他们常常引用“中心工作压倒一切”的提法，来掩饰自己轻视教育工作的错误观点。“中心工作压倒一切”的提法是什么意思呢？这是要我们正确地安排各项工作（当然也包括教育工作），加强工作的计划性，以便分别轻重缓急，集中力量把最中心的工作做好；但同时必须坚决反对“单打一”的作风，反对把中心工作孤立起来进行而不管或者放弃其他工作。我们在一定时间内只能有一个最中心的工作，在最中心的工作以外，势必还有第二位、第三位的工作。我们要将各项工作摆在适当的地位。因为各项工作是密切关联的，没有各项工作的紧密配合，要想真正做好中心工作也是不可能的。
    现在，我们的中心工作之一，是进行大规模的经济建设。为了完成这项任务，必须造就大量的建设人材。斯大林同志在“论苏联经济形势与党的政策”一文中说：“任何一个任务，特别是像我们国家工业化这样的巨大任务，没有生气勃勃的人，没有新的人，没有新的建设干部，是不可能实行的。”要培养大量的建设人材，就必须把学校办好，首先把高等学校办好，其次把中小学办好，因为中小学教育是人民教育事业的基础。有人说，培养工业建设人材是高等学校的事情，和中小学无关，特别是和小学无关。这种看法是不对的。我们不仅要培养高级的工业建设人材，而且要培养中级的工业建设人材。这样，就必须把中等技术学校办好。至于办好普通中学的意义，也是很显然的；因为它要源源不断地输送学生到高等学校。若干中等学校教学质量的下降，已经给高等学校的教学造成困难，这种教训是再也不能重复的了。说到小学教育，它和培养建设人材的关系表面上似乎不是那么直接的；但是“十年树木，百年树人”，培养人材是一种长远的事业，而小学教育是基础教育；如果我们不能把小学教育办好，在几年以后就会看到它的后果，所以我们必须朝远处看。而且小学教育和群众的关系最为密切，在学校混乱现象发展得严重的地方，学生家长已经表示不满，个别的甚至对党和人民政府的文化教育政策发生疑虑。我们的干部必须警惕到在这个问题上脱离群众的危险，坚决纠正轻视教育工作的错误观点，把教育事业办好。
    有些同志藉口“教育和政治结合、和实际结合”，乱拉教师和学生参加社会活动。这是完全错误的。教师和学生参加社会活动的目的，应该是为了配合教学。联共中央在“关于取消学生过重的社会工作及其他非学习性质工作的过重负担的办法”中指出：“学生校外工作底正确布置，应该是服从于学校的教学任务，帮助学生胜利地进行学习，帮助学校培养全面发展的、积极的共产主义社会底建设者。”因为教学工作是学校的基本任务，教师的主要责任是做好教学工作，学校教育的基本方式是课堂讲授。所以决不能把教师和学生当作所谓“机动干部”或工作队来使用，以致妨碍教学，或者妨碍他们的健康和必要的休息。而组织教师和学生参加社会活动，也只能由教育部门、新民主主义青年团和教育工会或教师联合会以及学生联合会统一负责，其他任何机关和团体则不能直接动员教师和学生参加社会活动。
    有人问，学校教育又要和实际结合，又不能妨碍教学和师生健康，这分寸究竟应该怎样掌握呢？这里在时间上须要有严格的限制，即教师参加社会活动的时间，学期当中每月不能超过十二小时，寒暑假不能超过整个假期的六分之一。至于学生参加社会活动的时间，一九五一年八月六日政务院在“关于改善各级学校学生健康状况的决定”中早就规定：高等学校和高级中等学校的学生每人每周不得超过三小时；初级中等学校学生每人每周不得超过二小时；小学学生每人每周不得超过一小时半。这些规定，各地必须严格执行，不得违反。为了保证教学工作的顺利进行，在教学时间内不允许动员教师和学生参加社会活动，如有特殊需要，须经市人民政府或专署批准。这就是界限，超越了这个界限，就是错误的。
    当然，我们在纠正随便动员教师和学生参加社会活动的过程中，也决不能让教师和学生对“教育必须和实际结合”的原则有任何模糊的认识，以致发生轻视政治、脱离实际、关门教书、关门读书的现象。列宁在“青年团底任务”一文中教导说：“如果学习、教育和训练只局限于学校以内，而与蓬勃的实际生活脱离，这样的教育方式我们是不会相信的。”“只有把校内活动的每一步骤，把教育、训练和学习的每一步骤，与全体劳动者反对剥削者的斗争密切联系起来，才能学习这些东西。”过去有些地方对这些原则了解不够，在纠正乱拉教师参加社会活动的现象时，做了片面的宣传，以致使一部分教师和学生的认识模糊起来，这种教训此次必须避免。
    要彻底纠正随便动员教师参加社会活动的现象，还必须克服某些党、政机关对待上级指示的阳奉阴违的态度。一九五一年间，若干大行政区领导机关曾发布有关指示，但是有些机关没有据以认真布置工作，更没有及时检查执行情况。例如，有的省人民政府在一九五二年一月初发了指示，说学校的混乱现象普遍存在，必须纠正；隔了将近一年，在一九五二年十二月末，又发了指示，还是说学校的混乱现象普遍存在，必须纠正。这就说明，那里的省人民政府没有负责地去解决问题，所以那里的情况也就没有改变。至于某些县级干部的错误就更严重，他们公然明知故犯，甚至在他们的错误行为受到报纸的批评以后，仍然抗拒批评，坚持错误，说什么“报上只管批评，该拉教师搞突击工作，还得照样拉”。这种严重的无组织无纪律现象，显然是和某些省级领导机关对待上级指示的不严肃的态度分不开的。因此，纠正这种态度是极为必要的。各地党政机关必须充分估计这一工作的重要意义，一定把它做好。
