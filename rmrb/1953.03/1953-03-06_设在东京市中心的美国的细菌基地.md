    US Bacterial Base Located in Downtown Tokyo

    The Japanese delegation attending the Vienna World People's Peace Congress issued a booklet entitled "Report on Japan and the Japanese Peace Movement," which included a report exposing the crimes of the United States in engaging in research and manufacturing of bacteriological weapons in Japan. The full text is as follows:

    At the end of December 1949, the Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals, led by former Japanese military medical lieutenant general Ryuji Kajitsuka, unanimously stated in their final statements at the Khabarovsk trial: "Emperor Hirohito, Lieutenant General Ishii, and Major General Wakamatsu should bear the main responsibility for the preparation and experimentation of bacteriological warfare. We regret that they are not on trial at this moment, and we hope that they will also be severely punished."

    What have these Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals been doing since then?

    The report of the International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China stated: "The American forces used these bacteriological weapons in many different ways, some of which appear to be developments of the methods used by the Japanese army in bacteriological warfare during the Second World War."

    We can prove these words with facts. The American bacteriological base is located in our country. The center for manufacturing bacteriological weapons is in the heart of our capital, Tokyo, disguised as Unit 406 of the US Eighth Army Medical Detachment. Closely sealed packages containing insects carrying infectious disease bacteria such as plague, cholera, scarlet fever, dysentery, and meningitis are regularly shipped from Fort Detrick in the United States along with experimental instructions. Then this Unit 406 immediately begins large-scale cultivation work.

    In front of the Tokyo City Koto Municipal Isolation Hospital, a car from Unit 406 appears three times a week. Each time, the driver secretly enters the laboratory and, two hours later, takes away some tightly sealed packages. This driver has been doing this work for two or three years. Some patients and corpses are also secretly taken away in this way. The director of this laboratory is the nephew of the number one bacteriological warfare criminal, Shiro Ishii.

    Blood collected from the Japanese people in the name of blood transfusions for wounded soldiers of the "United Nations" forces is sent to Unit 406 through blood banks for the purpose of cultivating bacteria-carrying insects. The unit also hires homeless vagrants at a price of 78 yen per person per day (Note: 360 yen equals one US dollar) to cultivate blood-sucking fleas, lice, and centipedes.

    The vast areas of the Imperial Palace in the Shiba district of Tokyo and the Imperial hunting grounds in Chiba Prefecture are designated as restricted areas. Ducks, egrets, and chickens are raised in many houses for the purpose of spreading bacteria. The living conditions of migratory birds such as swallows, wild ducks, and night herons are specifically studied in an attempt to spread bacteria in a vast area from Southeast Asia to Hokkaido and the Aleutian Islands.

    Small animals such as rats, field mice, and rabbits, as well as cattle and horses, are continuously supplied to Unit 406 throughout the year. The Saitama Experimental Animal Joint Sales Office in Kasukabe, Nishi-Saitama, Saitama Prefecture, and its branch, the Japan Experimental Animal Science Research Institute, handle all animal supply work. They supply Unit 406 with 50,000 small animals every month. The director of this institute is Ozawa, a Liberal Party member of the Saitama Prefectural Assembly, who has always supplied the Japanese army with small animals for bacteriological experiments.

    Colonel Kobayashi, who used to be an adjutant in Ishii Shiro's unit, is the accounting director.

    Yoshiei Furushima, a Liberal Party member of the House of Representatives, and Masami Sase and Eizo Kobayashi, former Liberal Party members of the House of Representatives, are also involved. They make a lot of money by selling animals for experimentation. They buy the animals for one to three yen each and sell them to Unit 406 for thirty to thirty-five yen each.

    The former Japanese Army Unit 731, a bacteriological unit established in North China under the order of the Emperor, has been disguised as the US Army Unit 406 in central Tokyo. Under the protection of the United States, bacteriological warfare criminals such as Shiro Ishii, Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano are now assisting in the conduct of bacteriological warfare.

    Since the United States began conducting bacteriological warfare, virulent infectious diseases have been prevalent in Japan. Especially in the areas around Tokyo, dysentery and meningitis, as well as a large number of food poisonings, increased several times or even dozens of times in 1952 compared to previous years. Moreover, the virulence of these bacteria is very strong, resulting in a high mortality rate.

### 设在东京市中心的美国的细菌基地

    设在东京市中心的美国的细菌基地
    出席维也纳世界人民和平大会的日本代表团印发了一种“关于日本和日本和平运动的报告”的小册子，其中有一篇揭露美国在日本从事研究和制造细菌武器罪行的报道，全文如下：
    一九四九年十二月底，以前日本军医中将梶塚隆二为首的细菌战犯在伯力审讯的最后陈述中众口一词地说：“日皇裕仁、石井中将、若松少将应对细菌战的准备与实验负主要责任，我们很惋惜他们此刻未在受审之列，我们希望他们也将会受到严厉的惩罚。”
    从那个时候起，这些日本的细菌战犯在干什么呢？
    调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会的报告中说：“美国军队以许多不同的方法使用了这些细菌武器，其中有一些方法，看起来是把日军在第二次世界大战期间进行细菌战所使用的方法加以发展而成的。”
    我们能够用事实来证明这些话。美国细菌基地设在我们国内。制造细菌武器的中心就是在我国首都东京市中心，伪装为美国第八军卫生部队的第四○六处。严密包封的装着带有鼠疫、霍乱、猩红热、赤痢和脑膜炎等传染病细菌的昆虫的包裹，经常和进行实验的训令一起从美国狄特里克营运送到那里。于是这个四○六处便立刻开始大量培殖的工作。
    在东京市江东的市立隔离医院的门前，四○六处的一辆汽车每周出现三次。每一次，那个司机总是偷偷地走进实验室，而在两小时之后便带走一些严密包封的包裹。这个司机干这样的工作已有两三年了。有一部分病人和尸体也是用这样的方式偷偷弄走的。这个实验室的主任是头号细菌战犯石井四郎的侄子。
    在为“联合国”军队伤兵输血的名义之下而征集的日本人民的血液通过血库送到四○六处，作为培殖带菌昆虫之用。该处并以每天每人七十八日圆（注：三百六十日圆合一美元）的价钱雇用一批无家可归的流浪者，来培养吸血的蚤、虱和蜈蚣。
    东京市芝区日皇行宫以及千叶县日皇狩猎地所在的广大地区都被规定为禁区。在许多房子中养着鸭子、白鹭和鸡，以供传播细菌之用。对于像燕子、野鸭和夜苍鹭等候鸟的生活条件，并特别进行研究，为的是企图在从东南亚到北海道和阿留申群岛的广大区域传播细菌。
    像老鼠、田鼠和兔子等小动物以及牛、马，是一年到头不间断地向四○六处供应的。在埼玉县西埼玉的粕壁的埼玉实验动物联合售卖所及其分支机构日本实验动物科学研究所，包办全部供应动物的工作。它们每月供给四○六处五万只小动物。这个研究所所长是埼玉县议会的自由党议员小泽，他一向供应日本军队以小动物用来进行细菌实验。
    以前在石井四郎的部队中当副官的上校小林是会计主任。
    自由党的众议院议员古岛义英和自由党的前任众议院议员佐濑昌三和小林英三，也参与其事。他们靠出卖实验用的动物大赚其钱，他们以每只一到三日圆的价格买进那些动物，而以每只三十到三十五日圆的价格卖给四○六处。
    过去在日皇命令下在中国华北建立的细菌部队—前日军七三一部队，已改头换面作为在东京中心区的美军四○六处。在美国的庇护下，石井四郎、若松次郎和北野政藏等细菌战犯现在正在协助细菌战的进行。
    自从美国开始进行细菌战之后，烈性的传染病就曾在日本流行。特别是在东京周围的地区，一九五二年赤痢和脑膜炎症以及大量的食物中毒，比往年增加了几倍甚至几十倍。而且这些细菌的毒力很强，因而死亡率很高。
