Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 3rd - The Korean and Chinese People's Army achieved new victories in a series of attacks, ambushes, and blocking actions during the last six days of February (February 23rd to 28th), exhausting the enemy and inflicting heavy casualties.

	During these six days, the Korean and Chinese People's Army conducted nine assault battles, eliminating more than 460 enemy soldiers.

	On the morning of February 23rd, a unit of our army, with swift action, attacked an important forward position of the ROK 15th Division five kilometers south of Gao Cheng on the eastern front. The battle lasted twenty minutes, and all seven platoons of the defending enemy (four infantry platoons and three platoons including heavy weapons, mortars, and reconnaissance), about 200 men, were wiped out.

	Two other major assault battles occurred in Tieyuan on the central front and Changchengli on the eastern front. On the night of February 24th, a night raid team from our army on the central front passed through seven layers of barbed wire set up by the enemy, crossed two highways, and advanced directly into the defense zone of a battalion of the U.S. 3rd Division near Yuejingli, northeast of Tieyuan. The enemy did not notice until the first shot was fired, and then responded hastily. Our army fiercely attacked the enemy for ten minutes, destroyed four bunkers, killed or wounded more than 40 enemy soldiers, and returned victoriously with captured light machine guns. On the night of February 26th, another assault team from our army attacked a position of the ROK 12th Division south of Changchengli on the eastern front, repelled three enemy counterattacks, and eliminated more than 130 enemy soldiers.

	During these six days, the Korean and Chinese People's Army also carried out eight blocking actions, eliminating more than 170 enemy soldiers. Each enemy harassment was quickly repelled. Before dawn on February 23rd, two platoons of the ROK Capital Division stealthily attacked a forward position of our army near Shangsuoli, southeast of Jinhua, and were repelled by our defending forces. The enemy suffered 26 casualties and abandoned five nylon flak vests used to bolster their courage.

	During these six days, the Korean and Chinese People's Army also carried out five ambush operations, in which most of the enemy caught in our army's ambush were annihilated. On the night of February 23rd, in an ambush northwest of Ruye Mountain and southeast of Machangli on the western front, our ambush force completely annihilated a platoon of the U.S. Marine Corps 1st Division escorted by tanks. This enemy force was originally out to harass our positions. The enemy's five tanks, fully loaded with infantry, set out, followed by a company of enemy soldiers trailing behind the tanks. When the enemy's tanks entered the pre-set ambush circle of our army, our anti-tank warrior team immediately used grenades to damage the two leading tanks. Our ambushing infantry forces then launched an assault, annihilating all the enemy soldiers on the tanks. Then, they routed the enemy following behind the tanks. This battle resulted in over 40 enemy casualties. Our army's ambush team destroyed the two damaged enemy tanks and withdrew to their positions before dawn.

	In these six days, the Korean and Chinese People's Army frontline mobile artillery fire killed or wounded 552 enemy soldiers, and our frontline anti-aircraft artillery units shot down 16 enemy aircraft and damaged 23 enemy aircraft.

    朝中部队二月最后六天又杀伤大批敌军
    前线高射炮部队击落击伤敌机三十九架
    【新华社朝鲜前线三日电】二月的最后六天，（二十三日到二十八日），朝中人民军队在一连串的袭击、阻击、伏击等战斗中取得新的胜利，使敌人疲惫不堪，遭到大批的伤亡。
    在这六天中，朝中人民部队先后进行了九次袭击战斗，共计歼敌四百六十多名。
    二十三日清晨，我军某部以迅猛动作袭击东线高城以南五公里处李伪军第十五师的一个重要前沿阵地。这次战斗历时二十分钟，守敌七个排（步兵四个排和重火器排、迫击炮排、搜索排等三个排）约二百人全部被歼。
    另外两次较大的袭击战斗，发生在中线铁原和东线长承里。二十四日夜，中线我军的一支夜袭队穿过敌人设置的七道铁丝网，越过两条公路，一直插到铁原东北月井里附近美军第三师一个营的防区内。敌人始终没有发觉，当枪声一响才仓卒应战。我军在敌人群里猛打十分钟，炸毁了四个地堡，杀伤敌人四十多名，扛着缴获的轻机枪胜利而回。二十六日夜，我军的另一支袭击队袭击东线长承里以南李伪军第十二师的一个阵地，并打退敌人三次反扑歼敌一百三十多名。
    朝中人民军队在这六天中又进行了八次阻击战，共歼敌一百七十多名。敌人每次的袭扰都被很快击退。二十三日天明之前，李伪军首都师两个排偷袭我军在金化东南上所里附近的一个前沿阵地，被我守军击退。敌军伤亡二十六人，并丢下用以壮胆的尼龙避弹衣五件。
    在这六天中朝中人民部队还进行了五次伏击战，中我军埋伏的敌人大部被全歼。二十三日夜，在西线汝山西北马场里东南的一次伏击战中，我伏击部队将由坦克护送的美海军陆战队第一师一个排全部歼灭。这股敌人本来是出来袭扰的，敌人的五辆坦克满载着步兵出发，后面还有一个连的敌人跟随坦克行进。当敌人的坦克进入我军预设的伏击圈后，我军的反坦克战士小组立刻用手雷将前头的两辆坦克击伤，埋伏着的我军步兵部队随即发起冲锋，将坦克上的敌人全部歼灭。接着又将跟在坦克后面的敌人击溃。这场战斗共计歼敌四十多名。我军伏击队将两辆已被击伤的敌军坦克破坏后，在天明前撤回阵地。
    朝中人民军队前线游动炮火在这六天中共击毙击伤敌军五百五十二名，我军前线高射炮部队共击落敌机十六架、击伤敌机二十三架。
