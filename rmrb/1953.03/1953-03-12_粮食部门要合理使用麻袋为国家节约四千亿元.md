The Grain Department Should Rationally Use Gunny Sacks to Save the Country 400 Billion Yuan
Central Grain Ministry Transportation and Supply Department

Gunny sacks are the main packaging tools for the grain department. In order to complete the state's grain management and supply tasks, the grain department's investment in gunny sacks is quite large. If these gunny sacks were connected one by one, their length would be equal to twenty times the journey from Manzhouli to Guangzhou. At present, there are many problems in the use of gunny sacks in the grain department. The main thing is that many cadres in the grain department have a supply system mentality in their management, do not keep careful accounts, do not understand the basic situation, and do not conscientiously implement the national regulations. Therefore, the phenomenon of wasting gunny sacks is still very serious.

First, a large number of gunny sacks are occupied by grain storage. In 1951, the grain company system stored 71.17 percent of all stored grain in gunny sacks. Although the higher authorities called for loose storage of grain to save gunny sacks in 1952, most companies did not implement this. Across the country, grain stored in gunny sacks still accounts for about 60 percent of the total inventory, which is very unreasonable. It is necessary to store non-safe moisture content grain in gunny sacks; it is also appropriate to temporarily store grain in gunny sacks in cities with a high rate of grain turnover. However, it is extremely unreasonable for many grain agencies to use gunny sacks for long-term storage of grain with safe moisture content and grain that is intended to be stored for a long time. We should be careful in our calculations and use substitutes to store grain in bulk to save expenses. Reed mats in the north and bamboo fences in the south are cheap substitutes for storing grain in bulk. For example, calculating the storage of 100 million catties of grain for one year: storing it in gunny sacks costs 3.888 billion yuan, while storing it in bulk using reed mats only costs 559 million yuan, and using bamboo fences only costs 249 million yuan. All levels of grain agencies should widely adopt substitutes to store grain, saving funds for the country.

Second, most grain agencies often do not know the number of gunny sacks in their own units, do not understand the basic situation, and have no idea what they have, which inevitably leads to the accumulation of a large number of gunny sacks. The amount of grain managed per gunny sack by grain agencies in Hebei Province was 902 catties in 1951, but it fell to 539 catties in 1952. This not only accumulated the province's funds, but also increased the state's expenditure on purchasing new sacks. The Jiangxi Provincial Grain Department had 200,000 new sacks in their original bundles, which had not been used for more than half a year, accumulating funds of 6 billion yuan. Interest alone cost 360 million yuan. However, they repeatedly urged the higher authorities to transfer gunny sacks. All these chaotic phenomena are caused by irresponsible, unthrifty, and ignorant bureaucratic work styles and a supply system mentality. All grain agencies should conduct in-depth inspections and clear out the accumulated gunny sacks to accelerate the turnover of gunny sacks.

Third, due to poor storage and arbitrary waste, the state's property has suffered serious losses. According to incomplete statistics from the Central South Region Grain Company in the first half of 1952, the losses caused by moldy gunny sacks amounted to more than 30 million yuan. The Sanbu working group in Xiaogan, Hubei, with only a dozen cadres, used 102 brand-new gunny sacks as mattresses and door curtains. Such mismanagement and arbitrary waste must be resolutely overcome, and leading cadres should especially go deep into the grassroots level to pay attention to inspection and correction.

Fourth, the departmentalism of some grain agency cadres is still very serious. They are afraid of failing to complete their tasks, blindly control a portion of the gunny sacks, ambush the higher authorities, and do not actively transfer out empty sacks. The Guangdong Provincial Grain Company accumulated more than 200,000 empty gunny sacks, but was unwilling to transfer them out, intending to keep them for use during the grain purchase season. This affects the entire agency's flexible use of gunny sacks and increases the higher authorities' expenditure on purchasing new sacks. This is incompatible with the overall concept emphasized in large-scale economic construction.

Due to the above reasons, the turnover efficiency of gunny sacks in the entire grain system has been greatly reduced. In the past two years, the turnover times of gunny sacks in the former grain company system have lagged behind the turnover times of grain. In 1952, the grain company system averaged only 796.47 catties of grain managed per gunny sack, with an annual turnover rate of less than four times. The grain department has decided to implement an economic accounting system step by step in 1953, reduce commodity circulation costs, and ensure the completion of profit delivery. It is especially necessary to tighten expenditures on gunny sacks and further improve and strengthen the management and use of gunny sacks. This is completely necessary. We believe that in the future, the grain department must pay attention to the following four points in the use of gunny sacks:

First, implement quota management of gunny sacks. The Central Grain Ministry has formulated the quota for the use of gunny sacks in each province and city in 1953 based on the proportion of business and supply tasks in each province and city, as well as warehousing and transportation conditions. Grain agencies in each province and city must mobilize employees to make ideological preparations, further develop the enthusiasm and creativity of each staff member, overcome conservative thinking, learn bulk loading methods and promote bulk loading experience (mainly using substitutes), to ensure the realization of quota requirements.

Second, actively sort out the numbers of gunny sacks, understand the basic situation, and lay the foundation for the implementation of the economic accounting system. Grain agencies have arranged several times in the past to sort out the work of gunny sacks. Due to the failure of some provincial and municipal agencies to conscientiously implement it, the lack of a sound accounting system, and the failure to assign special personnel to be responsible for this work, it became chaotic again in two or three months after the cleanup. After cleaning up the gunny sacks in the future, special personnel should be designated to be responsible for management, improve the entry and exit and accounting system, and achieve absolute consistency between accounts and goods.

Third, strengthen the reporting system from bottom to top and the planning from top to bottom, overcome waste, avoid accumulation, and improve the unified allocation system of gunny sacks. Whether the plan of the higher-level agency is accurate must be guaranteed by the reporting system from bottom to top. With reliable reporting figures as the basis for deciding on the increase and allocation of gunny sacks, this can overcome the phenomenon of long-term accumulation of gunny sacks in some areas, accelerate the turnover of gunny sacks, and reduce the number of sacks used. Grain agencies at all levels must firmly abide by the national unified allocation system of gunny sacks, so as not to affect the completion of grain transfer tasks.

Fourth, leading cadres of grain departments at all levels must attach importance to the management and use of gunny sacks. Saving gunny sacks is an important link in the implementation of the economic accounting system by the grain department to ensure the completion of profit delivery. Leading cadres at all levels should often study methods to save gunny sacks, pay attention to checking the "gunny sack quota" and usage management, and promptly correct the phenomenon of accumulation and waste.

At present, the merger of the grain department's agencies has been completed. After the merger of the grain company and the grain bureau, many favorable conditions will be generated for the use of gunny sacks. Most of the warehouses in the original grain bureau system are suitable for storing grain in bulk, and the cadres also have experience in storing grain in bulk, which can change the past practice of storing grain in bags in the grain company. In the past, the gunny sacks of the two agencies were two sets of turnover, but in the future, they can be turned over under a unified plan, reducing the use of many gunny sacks. The Central Grain Ministry requires that the national average of 1,400 catties of grain be managed per gunny sack in 1953, an increase of about 76 percent compared to the grain company's performance in 1952. According to preliminary calculations, the grain department can save the country 400 billion yuan in expenses in saving gunny sacks in 1953. As long as we further expose various phenomena of accumulation and waste and unreasonable usage methods, and implement the economic accounting system, this task can be confidently completed.

    粮食部门要合理使用麻袋为国家节约四千亿元
    中央粮食部运输供应司
    麻袋是粮食部门主要的包装用具。粮食部门为了完成国家粮食经营和供应任务，在麻袋上的投资是相当庞大的。如果把这些麻袋一个连一个地接起来，其长度等于从满洲里到广州的路程的二十倍。现在粮食部门在使用麻袋方面存在着许多问题，主要的是粮食部门的许多干部，在经营当中存在着供给制思想，不算细账，不摸家底，不认真执行国家规定的制度，因此，浪费麻袋的现象还非常严重。
    第一、大批麻袋被储粮占用着。一九五一年粮食公司系统以麻袋储存的粮食，达全部存粮的百分之七十一点一七。一九五二年上级虽然号召散存粮食，节约麻袋，但多数公司并未执行。全国以麻袋储存的粮食仍占全部库存百分之六十左右，这个数字是很不合理的。以麻袋装储非安全水份的粮食是必要的；在粮食流转速度大的城市，以麻袋装粮暂时储存也是应该的。但有不少的粮食机构把安全水份的粮食以及准备储存较长时间的粮食，也用麻袋长期储存，这就极不合理了。我们应该精打细算，用代用品来散装粮食，以节省开支。北方的苇席与南方的竹围，都是散存粮食的廉价代用品。如以一亿斤粮食保管一年计算：以麻袋储存，需要开支三十八亿八千八百万元，而使用苇席散存仅开支五亿五千九百万元，使用竹围仅开支二亿四千九百万元。各级粮食机构都应该广泛采用代用品储存粮食，替国家节省资金。
    第二、大部分粮食机构往往搞不清本单位的麻袋数字，不摸家底，心中无数，这就必然积压大批麻袋。河北省粮食机构每条麻袋的经营粮食量，在一九五一年是九百零二斤，一九五二年竟降到五百三十九斤。这不仅积压了该省的资金，而且增加了国家购买新袋的开支。江西省粮食厅存有原捆新袋二十万条，半年多没有动用，积压资金六十亿元，光利息一项，就损失三亿六千万元。但他们却向上级一再催索调入麻袋。以上这些混乱现象，都是由于不负责任，不精打细算，不摸家底的官僚主义作风和供给制思想造成的。所有的粮食机构都应该深入检查，把积压的麻袋清理出来，以加速麻袋的周转。
    第三、由于保管不善，任意糟塌，使国家资财遭受严重的损失。据中南区粮食公司一九五二年上半年不完全的统计，因麻袋霉烂所造成的损失达三千余万元。湖北孝感三?埠工作组仅有干部十余人，他们竟以全新麻袋一百零二条当作垫褥和门帘使用。这种管理不当，任意浪费任意糟塌的现象必须坚决克服，领导干部尤应深入下层，注意检查纠正。
    第四、部分粮食机构的干部本位主义的思想还很严重。他们怕完不成任务，盲目地控制一部分麻袋，向上级打埋伏，不主动将空袋调出。广东省粮食公司积压了二十多万条空麻袋，但不愿外调，打算留到购粮季节使用，这就影响了整个机构对麻袋的灵活使用，并增加了上级购买新袋的开支。这和大规模经济建设中所强调的整体观念是不相容的。
    由于上述种种原因，整个粮食系统麻袋的周转效率大大降低。两年来，前粮食公司系统的麻袋周转次数都落后于粮食周转次数。一九五二年粮食公司系统平均一条麻袋只经营了七九六点四七斤粮食，年周转率不到四次。一九五三年粮食部门已决定有步骤地实行经济核算制，缩减商品流转费，保证上缴利润的完成；特别在麻袋上要紧缩开支，并进一步改善和加强麻袋的管理使用工作，这是完全需要的。我们认为今后粮食部门在麻袋使用上必须注意以下四点：
    一、实行麻袋定额管理。中央粮食部已经根据各省市经营及供应任务的比例，及仓储与运输条件，制定了一九五三年各省市麻袋使用定额。各省市粮食机构必须发动职工做好思想准备，进一步发挥每个工作人员的积极性和创造性，克服保守思想，学习散装方法及推广散装经验（主要是利用代用品），以保证定额要求的实现。
    二、积极地清理麻袋数字，摸清家底，为实行经济核算制奠定基础。粮食机构在过去曾经布置过几次清理麻袋工作，由于部分省市机构未能认真执行，缺乏健全的账务制度，没有指定专人负责这项工作，因此清理后不到两三个月，就又混乱起来了。今后清理麻袋后，应指定专人，负责管理，健全出入库及账务制度，做到账货绝对相符。
      三、加强自下而上的表报制度及自上而下的计划性，克服浪费，避免积压，健全麻袋统一调拨制度。上级机构的计划能否准确，必须由自下而上的表报制度来保证。上级有了可靠的表报数字作为决定麻袋增添调拨的根据，这就可以克服麻袋在部分地区长期积压的现象，加速麻袋周转次数，减少用袋数量。各级粮食机构必须坚决遵守全国麻袋统一调拨制度，以免影响粮食调运任务的完成。
    四、各级粮食部门领导干部，必须重视麻袋管理使用工作。节用麻袋是粮食部门实行经济核算制，保证上缴利润的完成的重要环节。各级领导干部应经常研究节约麻袋的方法，注意检查“麻袋定额”及使用管理状况，及时纠正积压浪费现象。
    目前，粮食部门的机构合并工作已经完成。粮食公司和粮食局合并后，对于麻袋使用会产生很多有利条件。原粮食局系统大部分仓库适合散存粮食，干部也有散存经验，可以改变过去粮食公司袋存的作法。过去两个机构的麻袋是两套周转，今后可在统一计划下统一周转，少用很多麻袋。中央粮食部要求一九五三年全国平均一条麻袋经营粮食一千四百斤，比较粮食公司一九五二年的经营成绩约提高百分之七十六。根据初步计算，一九五三年粮食部门在节用麻袋方面可给国家节省四千亿元的开支。我们只要更进一步地揭发各种积压浪费现象和不合理的使用方法，贯彻经济核算制，这个任务是有把握完成的。
