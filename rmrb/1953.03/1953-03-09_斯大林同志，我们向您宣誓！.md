    "Comrade Stalin, We Swear to You!"
    By our reporters Liu Shiping, Ji Yin, and Lin Li
    The people of Shanghai are weeping, weeping for the passing of our great teacher and sincere friend, Comrade Stalin!
    In recent days, the people of Shanghai have been watching Comrade Stalin's health with utmost concern. How many people waited by the radio, how many people inquired on the phone, how many people hoped to hear a bulletin that Comrade Stalin's health was improving; but the news that came was that Comrade Stalin had stopped breathing, and had parted from us forever.
    In immense grief, flags flew at half-mast on the tall buildings of Shanghai, on the ships anchored in the heart of the Huangpu River, and on the houses on both sides of every street and alley. People in offices, troops, factories, and schools wore black纱. The movies that were being shown were stopped, the plays were not performed, all banquets were cancelled. Shanghai was immersed in silent mourning.
    Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government Soong Ching Ling, the three secretaries of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Comrades Chen Yi, Tan Zhenlin, and Zhang Dingcheng, and the Fourth Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, Comrade Chen Pixian, along with more than four hundred staff members of government departments, went to the Soviet Consulate General in Shanghai to offer condolences. On the 7th, representatives of workers, students, troops, and government staff in Shanghai, as well as tens of thousands of people, streamed to the Soviet Consulate General in Shanghai to mourn the great leader and brilliant teacher of the working people of the world, Comrade Stalin.
    An employee of the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, with a sorrowful and heavy heart, told reporters: The day after the news of Comrade Stalin's serious illness was published in the newspaper, their five telephone lines rang non-stop all day, receiving more than two thousand calls in one night. Every caller anxiously inquired about Comrade Stalin's health. One of them, named Yao Jinxian, a female worker at Anle Wool Spinning Factory, called for the first time to say: she had a "secret ancestral remedy" for cerebral hemorrhage, and wanted the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to send a telegram to the Soviet Ministry of Health to save Comrade Stalin's life. After a while, Yao Jinxian called again for the second time, anxiously inquiring whether her "secret ancestral remedy" had been sent to Comrade Stalin. On the afternoon of the 6th, five young workers from the Yimiao District Production Cooperative were studying when they heard the unfortunate news of Comrade Stalin's death on the radio. They were stunned and began to cry. Shi Junfu, an old worker at the Shanghai Electric Power Company's Power Plant, had been to the Soviet Union. With tears welling up in his eyes, he recounted his grief over the past two days: I was working when I got the news of Comrade Stalin's death. I held back my tears so that it wouldn't affect my work. I didn't want to bring the sad news to the children at home; but when I got home, I saw the children crying, and my wife crying, because they had already learned of the unfortunate news from the neighborhood work committee and the school teachers. Shi Junfu said: I am very sad, even more sad than losing my parents. But I understand that the best way to mourn Comrade Stalin is to strengthen the unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. Lu Agou, the deputy director of the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory, who had visited the Soviet Union, wrote a letter to the newspaper's editorial department saying, "Ever since I heard that Comrade Stalin was seriously ill, I have been silently praying for his recovery. Who knew that at noon on the 6th, the news of Comrade Stalin's unfortunate death suddenly came, which made me so sad that I couldn't even speak." "But," Lu Agou continued, "although Comrade Stalin has passed away, his name will forever live in the hearts of the working people of the world. We, the Chinese working class, must unite more closely with the Soviet working people, heighten our vigilance, and resolutely defend world peace." In front of the entrance to Fudan University, a large group of young male and female students stood in front of the blackboard newspaper; they silently read - here was posted a large oath of allegiance to Comrade Stalin, drafted by a student with the signature "Yongding." The oath was written in sorrowful sentences: "Beloved father, may you rest in peace. We Chinese youth, like the Soviet youth, stand before your coffin and swear: In memory of you, the youth of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, will be united like steel, and we will fight to the end to realize your ideal—a communist society—like the youth of the Soviet Union!" After the students finished reading the oath, they solemnly signed their names on it one by one. On this sorrowful and unforgettable day, countless young students in Shanghai made the greatest determination to strive to join the Chinese Communist Party and the New Democratic Youth League, and to be Stalin's students. Qian Zhongli, a student at Fudan University, wrote to the Party branch: "In order to inherit Comrade Stalin's legacy, I am determined to work hard to improve myself and become a Communist Party member, and to fight for the complete realization of Communism. This is my sincere wish." Yao Weibin, a member of the Youth League at Shanghai Industrial School, said: "When Lenin passed away, Paul Korchagin swore to dedicate everything to the Party. Now I want to swear to Comrade Stalin that I will also dedicate myself to the Party." The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's land, air, and naval forces stationed in Shanghai are very aware of the great responsibility after Comrade Stalin's death. In great sorrow, they swore: to be a hundred times more vigilant like the Soviet Red Army, and to be ready at all times to serve the motherland. Combat hero He Shuangjin swore on this day: "Respected Comrade Stalin, I swear to you that we must unite more closely with the Soviet people and the Soviet army, increase our vigilance tenfold, and we must also work harder to study the advanced Soviet military science, accelerate the construction of a regularized and modernized national defense force, and strive to the end to defend the security of the motherland and lasting world peace." The entire soldiers of the Third Company of a certain regiment of the Shanghai Public Security Force wrote in grief: "We are a group of soldiers from the Shanghai Public Security Corps. When we heard the unfortunate news of Comrade Stalin's death, how sad and heavy were our hearts! We all silently stood up and lowered our heads. We were so sad that we could not speak and could not swallow our food. Many comrades had never shed tears before, but now tears welled up in their eyes. Everyone repeatedly called out this great name: 'Stalin!' We are a group of children who grew up in hardship. In the old world, we suffered a lot of insults and discrimination. We got up before dawn and went to bed late at night, working like cattle and horses, but still could not fill our stomachs. At that time, the lives of the poor were not worth half a cent. We could only be beaten with sticks and whipped, swallowing our tears into our stomachs. Dear Comrade Stalin! Thanks to your brilliant doctrine, which illuminated our way forward and encouraged the Chinese people in their arduous struggle, the Chinese people overcame the difficult situation and gained happiness and light. However, now, Comrade Stalin! You have left us forever! Our hearts feel indescribable sorrow and grief." The soldiers of the Third Company finally swore: "Dear Comrade Stalin! We swear to you: We will unyieldingly study the superb military skills and fearless fighting spirit of the Soviet Army elder brothers, who grew up under your education; we will tirelessly improve our skills, build a strong national defense force, consolidate the national defense of the motherland, and defend lasting peace in the Far East and the world! Dear Comrade Stalin! We swear to you: We must turn grief into strength. Under the tense situation where the remaining enemies at home and the foreign imperialists still exist and are continuing to carry out sabotage activities and conspiring to expand the war of aggression, we must never be paralyzed and must be highly vigilant, holding our guns tightly, establishing the idea of 'always being a fighting force', and standing together with the Soviet Army elder brothers; if the imperialist war-mongers dare to continue to expand the war of aggression, we will definitely beat them to the ground." In endless grief and mourning, the people of Shanghai wiped away their tears and swore to the beloved Comrade Stalin with firm will. The immortal name of Comrade Stalin will forever live in the hearts of the people of Shanghai and all of China.

    “斯大林同志，我们向您宣誓！”
    本报记者　刘时平　季音　林里
    上海人民在哭泣，上海人民在为我们的伟大导师、真挚的友人斯大林同志的逝世而哭泣！
    这几天来，上海人民万分关切地注视着斯大林同志的健康。多少人守候在收音机旁，多少人在电话里相互询问，多少人希望着听到斯大林同志健康好转的公报；可是，传来的消息，却是斯大林同志停止了呼吸，他和我们永别了。
    在万分悲痛中，上海市的高楼大厦上、停泊在黄浦江心的轮船上和每条街道、里弄两边的屋宇上，都悬挂半旗志哀，机关、部队、工厂、学校的人们都佩带起了黑纱。正在放映的电影停演了，戏剧不唱了，一切酒宴停止了。上海沉浸在静穆的哀悼中。
    中央人民政府宋庆龄副主席、中共中央华东局的三位书记陈毅同志、谭震林同志、张鼎丞同志和中共上海市委会第四书记陈丕显同志，和四百多位机关工作人员，到苏联驻上海总领事馆去吊唁。七日，上海市的工人代表、学生代表、部队和机关工作人员的代表，以及成千成万的人群，川流不息地走向苏联驻上海总领事馆，吊唁全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和天才导师斯大林同志。
    上海市中苏友好协会的一个工作人员充满着悲痛而沉重的心情对记者说：报上公布了斯大林同志身患重病的消息的第二天，他们的五部电话机就整天响个不停，一夜接到了二千多个电话，每一个问话的人，都万分焦急地询问着斯大林同志的健康情况。其中有一位叫姚金仙的，是安乐毛纺厂的女工，她第一次打电话来说：她有一个专治脑溢血症的“祖传秘方”，要中苏友协用加急电报告诉苏联卫生部，以挽救斯大林同志的生命。过了一会，姚金仙又第二次打电话来，着急地询问是否已把她的 “祖传秘方”送给了斯大林同志。六日下午，邑庙区生产合作社五个青年工人正在学习，听到广播器里报告着斯大林同志逝世的不幸消息，呆住哭起来了。上海电力公司发电厂的老工人史俊甫曾经去过苏联，他噙着满眶欲出的眼泪，述说着他这两天的悲痛心情：我正在工作，得到了斯大林同志逝世的消息。我忍住眼泪，使它不至于影响了工作。我更不愿把悲痛的消息带给家里的孩子们；可是，一到家就看见孩子们在哭，老婆在哭，原来他们从里弄工作委员会、学校老师那里已经知道了这不幸的消息。史俊甫说：我很难过，比失掉了父母还难过。但是我懂得：悼念斯大林同志的最好办法是加强中苏两国人民的团结。曾经访问过苏联的国营上海第二纺织机械厂副厂长陆阿狗写信给报纸编辑部说：“我自从听到斯大林同志得了重病以后，时时刻刻在默祷他病情的好转。那知六日中午，斯大林同志不幸逝世的消息突然传来，使我一时悲痛得连话都说不出来。”“但是，”陆阿狗继续写道：“斯大林同志虽然去世，他的名字将永远活在全世界劳动人民的心里。我们中国工人阶级一定与苏联劳动人民更紧密地团结在一起，提高警惕，坚决保卫世界和平。”复旦大学的门口，墙报前站着一大群年青的男女学生；他（她）们静默地读着——这里贴着一大张向斯大林同志宣誓的誓词，是一个签名为“永定”的同学起草的。誓词以悲痛的句子写道：“心爱的父亲啊，你长眠吧。我们中国的青年，像苏联青年一样，站在你的灵前宣誓：为了纪念你，我们中苏两国的青年将团结如钢，我们将像苏联的青年一样，为实现你的理想——共产主义社会而奋斗到底！”同学们读完誓词，便一个个在上边郑重地签上自己的名字。上海无数青年学生在这悲痛难忘的一天，下定了最大的决心，要争取参加中国共产党和新民主主义青年团，做个斯大林的学生。复旦大学学生钱中立写信给党支部：“为了继承斯大林同志的遗志，我决心努力提高自己，使自己成为一个共产党员，为共产主义的彻底实现而斗争。这是我赤诚的愿望。”上海工业学校青年团员姚维宾说：“列宁逝世时，保尔·柯察金曾经宣誓把一切献给党，现在我要向斯大林同志宣誓，我也要把自己献给党。”驻在上海的国防军——中国人民解放军的陆、空、海军的指战员们，他们非常明白斯大林同志逝世后的重大责任，他们在万分悲痛中宣誓：要像苏联红军一样地百倍警惕、时刻准备着为保卫祖国而效力。战斗英雄何双进就在这天宣誓说：“敬爱的斯大林同志，我向你宣誓，我们一定要和苏联人民、苏联军队更加紧密地团结一致，加倍地提高警惕，我们也一定更加努力学习苏联的先进军事科学，加速正规化、现代化国防军建设，为保卫祖国安全与世界持久和平奋斗到底。”上海公安部队某团三连全体战士悲痛地写道：“我们是上海市公安总队的一群战士。当我们听到斯大林同志逝世这个不幸的消息时，我们的心里是多么悲痛和沉重啊！我们大家默默地站起来，低下了头。我们难过得说不出话，咽不下饭。很多同志从来没有掉过泪，但是现在眼泪却夺眶而出了。大家反复地呼唤着这个伟大的名字：‘斯大林！’我们是一群从苦难中长大的孩子。在旧世界里，我们受过不少的侮辱与歧视，我们起五更，爬半夜，当牛当马，但是，还填不饱肚子。那时穷人的命不值半文钱，只有挨棍子打，鞭子抽，行行眼泪往肚里咽。亲爱的斯大林同志！由于你的光辉学说，照亮了我们前进的道路，鼓舞了在艰苦战斗中的中国人民，使中国人民克服了危难的局面，得到了幸福和光明。然而，现在，斯大林同志！你却永远离开我们而去了！我们的心里感到莫名的哀痛和悲伤。”第三连战士最后宣誓道：“亲爱的斯大林同志！我们向你宣誓：我们一定会顽强不屈地学习在你教养下长大起来的苏军老大哥的高超的军事技术和无畏的战斗精神；我们要不疲倦地提高自己的本领，建设强大的国防军，巩固祖国的国防，保卫远东和世界的持久和平！亲爱的斯大林同志！我们向你宣誓：我们一定要把悲痛化为力量。在国内残余敌人、国外帝国主义仍然存在，并且正在继续进行破坏活动，阴谋扩大侵略战争的紧张形势下，我们绝不麻痹，一定要高度的警惕起来，握紧枪杆，树立‘永远是战斗队’的思想，同苏军老大哥在一起；如果帝国主义战争贩子们敢于继续扩大侵略战争，我们一定把它打得落花流水。”上海人民在无尽的悲痛与哀悼中，拭干了眼泪，以坚定的意志，向敬爱的斯大林同志宣誓。斯大林同志不朽的名字，永远活在上海和全中国人民的心里。
