Reasonably Organizing Labor is a Crucial Step in Running Agricultural Production Cooperatives Well

In order to run agricultural production cooperatives well, it is essential to reasonably organize labor, so as to fully increase labor productivity and give play to the superiority of collective labor. In addition to distributing a certain amount of the harvest to cooperative members according to the land they invested, agricultural production cooperatives must also implement the principle of "to each according to his work," and fairly distribute the labor remuneration due to cooperative members. Only by reasonably organizing labor can we adapt to the characteristics of unified management and joint cultivation of agricultural production cooperatives, and realize the principle of "to each according to his work." Last year, many agricultural production cooperatives in pilot areas experienced serious idleness; in the early stage of the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ping順 County, Shanxi Province, some cooperative members were supposed to do ten points of work but only did eight points. All these problems resulted from the failure to adopt a scientific and reasonable system for organizing labor.

According to the experience of agricultural production cooperatives in various regions, implementing the "four-fixed" piecework system (fixing quantity, quality, time, and labor), and further implementing the production quota system, is a scientific method for reasonably organizing labor and realizing quota management. After the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative implemented the piecework system, the labor enthusiasm of the cooperative members was greatly improved, the head of the cooperative became more clear-headed, and the overall production planning of the cooperative was also strengthened. On this basis, they further implemented the "four-fixed" production quota system, and the cooperative members' enthusiasm for increasing production was further enhanced. These situations illustrate that the piecework system and the production quota system are progressive methods of organizing labor in agricultural production cooperatives. These methods can relatively reliably guarantee the realization of the distribution principle of "to each according to his work."

When piloting and rectifying agricultural production cooperatives in various regions, attention should be paid to solving the problem of reasonably organizing labor. In agricultural production cooperatives that already have a certain amount of management experience, it is relatively easy to implement the piecework system. After gaining some experience in implementing the piecework system and being able to make relatively reliable production plans, a permanent production quota system can be gradually implemented. Agricultural production cooperatives that are just starting out or lack management experience, although they still need to adopt the method of "fixed division and flexible evaluation" for a certain period of time and implement simple group labor, should strive to adopt the method of paying by work for agricultural tasks that are relatively easy to calculate in terms of quality and quantity, according to certain seasons, and then gradually transition to a comprehensive piecework system. It should be recognized that the promotion of an advanced working method must have certain conditions. Cadres leading agricultural production cooperatives in various regions should be good at helping cooperative members create conditions and solve various difficulties in the process of promoting the piecework system, and avoid using coercive orders; otherwise, advanced working methods will not be easily accepted by farmers.

    合理组织劳动力是办好农业生产合作社的重要环节
    为了办好农业生产合作社，必须合理地组织劳动力，以便充分提高劳动生产率，发挥集体劳动的优越性。农业生产合作社除了按照社员入股的土地分给一定的收获物外，还必须实行按劳取酬的原则，把社员应得的劳动报酬，公平地分给他们。只有合理地组织劳动力，才能适应农业生产合作社的统一经营、共同耕作的特点，实现按劳取酬的原则。去年许多地区试办的农业生产合作社中，曾经发生了严重的窝工现象；山西平顺县郭玉恩农业生产合作社建立初期，曾经发生过某些社员该做十分工而只做了八分的现象，这都是没有采用科学的合理的组织劳动力的制度的结果。
    根据各地农业生产合作社的经验，实行定量、定质、定时、定工的四定包工制，并进一步实行包产制，是合理组织劳动力、实现定额管理的科学方法。郭玉恩农业生产合作社实行包工制以后，社员的劳动积极性大大提高了，社长的头脑清醒了，全社的生产计划性也加强了。他们在这个基础上又实行了四定包产制，社员的增产热情更进一步地提高了。这些情况，说明了包工制和包产制是农业生产合作社中的进步的组织劳动的办法。这种办法可以比较确实地保证实现按劳取酬的分配原则。
    各地在试办和整顿农业生产合作社的时候，应该注意解决合理组织劳动力的问题。在已经有了一定的经营经验的农业生产合作社里，是比较容易实行包工制的。而在实行包工制有了一定的经验，并且能够作出比较确实的生产计划以后，就可以逐步实行常年包产制。开始试办的或经营管理经验还比较缺乏的农业生产合作社，虽然还须在一定的时期内，采用“死分活评”的办法，实行简单的分组劳动，但应争取按一定的季节，就比较易于计算质、量的农活，部分地采用按活计工的办法，然后逐步过渡到全面的包工制。应该认识，一种先进的工作方法的推行，必须要有一定的条件。各地领导农业生产合作社的干部，在推行包工制的过程中，要善于帮助社员创造条件，解决各种困难，切忌采用强迫命令的方式，否则，先进的工作方法也不易为农民所接受。
