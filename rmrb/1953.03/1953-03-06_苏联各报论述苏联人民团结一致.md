Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 5th: TASS reports that editorials in *Pravda*, *Izvestia*, *Red Star*, and many other Moscow newspapers on the 5th all spoke of the close unity and solidarity of the Soviet people with the Party of Lenin and Stalin.

	*Pravda*'s editorial stated: "The source of the strength of the Party of Lenin and Stalin is its close connection with the millions of working people, its unbreakable unity with the people. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a truly people's party, because its policies ensure the continuous strengthening of the Soviet Union and are in line with the vital interests of the Soviet working people. The Soviet people wholeheartedly support the Party's policies and have complete faith in the Party. Misfortune has befallen our Party and the people: our beloved leader and teacher, J. V. Stalin, has fallen seriously ill. In these anxious days, every Soviet person is responding enthusiastically to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union: 'The Central Committee and the Council of Ministers are confident that in these difficult days, our Party and all the Soviet people will demonstrate the greatest unity and solidarity, a resolute spirit and vigilance, and will redouble their efforts in the communist construction of our country, and will unite more closely around the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government.'" The editorial emphasized that Lenin, Stalin, and the heroic Communist Party they founded and cultivated, fostered in the Soviet people the excellent qualities of unity, resolute spirit, and vigilance. The broad masses of the people already possess these excellent qualities, which are the source of all our historic victories and the guarantee of our country's smooth progress toward communism.

	*Izvestia*'s editorial stated: "In order to achieve the victory of socialism, the Party of Lenin and Stalin united all the nationalities of the Soviet Union into a united, fraternal family, in which workers, peasants, and intellectuals work together in an atmosphere of friendship. This kind of unity of the people is unprecedented in history and unimaginable in capitalist countries; it can only arise under the Soviet system in the Soviet Union. This unbreakable unity of the Soviet people has been tempered and strengthened in the struggle for the freedom and independence of our socialist motherland and in the efforts to strengthen the power of the Soviet state." The editorial said: "There is no doubt that the entire Soviet people love the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin, and will redouble their efforts to successfully complete the task of communist construction, will tirelessly enhance their revolutionary vigilance, and will unite more closely around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Government. The unity of the Party and the people is the source of the invincible strength of the Soviet socialist state and the guarantee of our victorious advance toward communism."

	*Red Star*'s editorial stated: "The Soviet people have consistently been united in everything with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—their vanguard tempered in battle, their long-tested leader and teacher, the inspirer and organizer of all our historic victories. The Soviet people are well aware that as long as the Party of Lenin and Stalin is with them, they are strong and invincible."

    苏联各报论述苏联人民团结一致
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：五日真理报、消息报、红星报以及莫斯科许多其他报纸的社论都讲到苏联人民和列宁、斯大林党的紧密团结和一致。
    真理报社论写道：列宁、斯大林党的力量的源泉是它与千百万劳动人民的密切联系，是它与人民的牢不可破的团结。苏联共产党是一个真正人民的党，因为它的政策保证苏联力量的不断增强而且是符合苏联劳动人民的切身利益的。苏联人民全心全意地拥护党的政策，对党完全信任。我们党和人民遭到了不幸：我们敬爱的领袖和导师约·维·斯大林患了重病，在这些令人焦虑的日子里，每个苏联人都热烈地响应苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议公报的号召：“中央委员会和部长会议相信：在这些困难的日子里，我们的党和全体苏维埃人民一定会表现出最大的团结和一致、坚决的精神和警惕性，一定会加倍努力地从事我国的共产主义建设，一定会更加紧密地团结在共产党中央委员会和苏联政府的周围。”社论着重指出，列宁、斯大林和他们所缔造培育起来的英雄的共产党，培养了苏联人民的团结一致、坚决的精神与警惕性这些优良品质。广大人民群众都已经具备这些优良品质，这就是我们取得一切历史性胜利的源泉，是我们国家顺利地走向共产主义的保证。
    消息报社论写道：列宁、斯大林的党为了取得社会主义的胜利，把苏联各民族团结成了一个统一的兄弟大家庭，在这个大家庭里，工人、农民和知识分子一道在友爱的气氛中工作着。人民的这种团结在历史上是从来没有过的，在资本主义国家是不可想像的，只有在苏联的苏维埃制度下才能产生。苏联人民这种牢不可破的团结在争取我们社会主义祖国的自由和独立的斗争中，在加强苏维埃国家力量的努力中经受了锻炼，越来越坚固了。社论说：毫无疑问，苏联全国人民热爱苏联共产党和斯大林同志，一定会加倍努力来胜利地完成共产主义建设的任务，一定会不倦地提高革命警惕性和更加紧密地团结在苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府的周围。党和人民的团结是苏维埃社会主义国家的不可战胜的力量的源泉，是我们胜利地走向共产主义的保证。
    红星报社论写道：苏联人民一贯地在每一件事情上都和苏联共产党——他们在战斗中锻炼出来的先锋队、他们久经考验的领袖和导师、我们一切历史性胜利的鼓舞者和组织者团结一致。苏联人民十分清楚：只要列宁、斯大林的党同他们在一起，他们就是坚强的，不可战胜的。
