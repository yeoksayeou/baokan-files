Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 4th: According to TASS, New York, March 4th, Soviet delegation head Vyshinsky delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee meeting on the afternoon of March 2nd.

    Everyone waited with great concern for the speech by the Soviet Foreign Minister. The delegate seats, press seats, and gallery were filled long before the meeting began. In addition, many people hoped to hear the Soviet representative's speech, so the UN Secretariat had to open the Trusteeship Council's meeting hall and install loudspeakers there to broadcast Vyshinsky's speech. This hall was filled with audience members and UN Secretariat staff.

    Delegates, journalists, and audience members listened intently to Vyshinsky's speech, which was rich in facts and conclusive evidence. The Soviet representative exposed the hypocrisy and deceptive nature of the speech delivered by US Representative Lodge, who had claimed at the Political Committee meeting on February 25th that the US ruling circles "loved peace" and reiterated the tiresome old tune of previous US representatives, saying that the US was conducting a defensive war in Korea. Vyshinsky convincingly proved that the disasters that had befallen the Korean people were brought about by the Americans.

    Vyshinsky attacked the hypocrisy of the US ruling circles in trying to mask themselves with a facade of "love of peace." He cited the words of prominent US political and military leaders and the US press to illustrate that the US ruling circles were preparing a plan to further expand the war in the Far East.

    Vyshinsky said that the Republican government was not satisfied with continuing the Korean War and was taking many measures to realize its plan to further expand the war in the Far East. The US plans to expand the Korean War and launch another world war are becoming more and more blatant and the threat is becoming more and more serious.

    In the final part of his speech, the head of the Soviet delegation emphasized that the Soviet delegation would, as before, resolutely demand that the UN General Assembly adopt a resolution on the immediate end to the Korean War and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Vyshinsky made some sharp and witty remarks when referring to some of US Representative Lodge's words, which caused bursts of laughter several times.

    In order to weaken the impression created by the head of the Soviet delegation's speech, US Representative Lodge tried, apparently in vain, to respond to the irrefutable accusations contained in the speech of the head of the Soviet delegation. He only spoke emptily for a few minutes. His speech ended very clumsily, and the chairman of the committee did not even notice, and the venue was very silent for quite some time.

    After Lodge's speech, Committee Chairman Múnízī suggested that the deadline for registering to speak on the Korean issue be 6:00 PM on March 3rd.

    This suggestion shows that the US-British bloc obviously wants to end the Political Committee's discussion on the Korean issue and obstruct the passage of resolutions aimed at immediately ending the Korean War and peacefully settling the Korean issue.

    Vyshinsky spoke against the chairman's suggestion.

    He said that, in essence, the debate in our committee has not yet properly unfolded. Just as we are approaching the exploration of any possible suggestions for resolving the Korean issue in the spirit of peace and justice, someone is already suggesting that we cut off registration to speak. Last year, we spent almost a month and a half on the Korean issue, and I see no reason why today, we can say that on the sixth day, when the General Assembly has just begun its work, you suddenly want to cut off registration to speak, in other words, deliberately limit the debate. I know that there is a rumor in the lounge that some delegations are not interested in continuing the discussion. I don't think that's right. Once this issue is on the agenda, it is the responsibility of this committee and the General Assembly to discuss it from every angle.

    The head of the Soviet delegation emphasized that we made this suggestion because we attach great importance to the Korean issue and hope that perhaps an understanding can be reached at this General Assembly to completely and unconditionally end the Korean War. This is the primary issue. People must be given the opportunity to discuss this issue from all sides. Let the different political views and attitudes that the representatives may express become clear. But now someone is suggesting to us to end this issue as soon as possible, to let the Korean tragedy of bloodshed continue. The Soviet delegation believes that such a suggestion is wrong and that it restricts a very important issue that needs to be discussed. Vyshinsky finally stated that the Soviet delegation insisted that the registration to speak should not be cut off on the 3rd.

    At the end of the discussion on this issue, the committee passed a suggestion supported by the Soviet delegation with a majority of forty votes, that is, to cut off the registration to speak on March 4th.

    维辛斯基在联大政委会会议上
    揭露美国进一步扩大战争的计划
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社纽约四日讯：苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在联合国大会政治委员会三月二日下午的会议上发表了演说。
    大家以极大的关心等待着苏联外交部长的演说。代表席、新闻记者席和旁听席在会议开始以前早就坐满了。此外还有许多人希望听到苏联代表的演说，以致联合国秘书处不得不开放托管理事会的会议大厅，并在那里安装扩音器，以便转播维辛斯基的演说。这个大厅里坐满了旁听者和联合国秘书处的职员。
    代表、新闻记者和旁听者聚精会神地倾听维辛斯基事实充足、证据确凿的演说。苏联代表揭发了美国代表洛奇所发表的演说的伪善和骗人的性质，洛奇曾在二月二十五日在政治委员会会议上声称美国统治集团“爱好和平”，并且重弹前任美国代表令人厌烦的老调，说什么美国在朝鲜是在进行防御战。维辛斯基令人信服地证明了落到朝鲜人民头上的灾难是美国人带来的。
    维辛斯基抨击美国统治集团伪善地试图以“爱好和平”的假面具来掩饰自己。他列举了美国知名政治领袖和军事领袖与美国报纸的言论，来说明美国统治集团正在准备一个进一步扩大远东战争的计划。
    维辛斯基说，共和党政府并不以继续朝鲜战争为满足，正在采取许多措施，以实现它在远东进一步扩大战争的计划。美国扩大朝鲜战争与发动另一次世界大战的计划，一天比一天露骨，威胁一天比一天严重。
    苏联代表团团长在发言的最后部分强调说，苏联代表团将和以前一样坚决要求联合国大会通过关于立即结束朝鲜战争与和平解决朝鲜问题的决议。维辛斯基在提到美国代表洛奇的某些话时讲了一些尖锐的、妙趣横生的话，好几次引起哄堂大笑。
    为了要减弱苏联代表团团长的发言所造成的印象，美国代表洛奇显然徒劳无功地想答复苏联代表团团长发言中包含的无法驳倒的指责。他只空空洞洞地讲了几分钟。他的发言结束得非常笨拙，委员会主席甚至没有注意到，在相当长的一段时间内，会场上非常沉寂。
    洛奇发言后，委员会主席慕尼兹建议，三月三日下午六时截止朝鲜问题发言登记。
    这个建议说明美英集团显然想结束政治委员会关于朝鲜问题的讨论，并阻挠通过目的在于立即结束朝鲜战争与和平解决朝鲜问题的决议。
    维辛斯基发言反对主席的建议。
    他说，从实质上来说，在我们的委员会中辩论还没有适当地展开。在我们刚刚接近探讨根据和平与正义的精神解决朝鲜问题的任何可能的建议的时候，却已经有人建议截止发言登记了。我建议不要在明天——三月三日——截止发言登记，我建议等到其他代表团的代表发言之后再说。去年，我们花在朝鲜问题上的时间几乎有一个半月，我看不出有什么理由在今天，我们可以说在第六天，大会刚刚开始工作的时候，你们就突然想截止发言登记，换句话说，就是故意限制辩论。我知道，在休息室里有一种谣言说，某些代表团对于继续讨论下去不感兴趣。我认为这是不对的。一旦这个问题列入议程，这个委员会与大会就有责任从每一个角度来讨论这个问题。
    苏联代表团团长强调说，我们所以提出这个建议，是因为我们非常重视朝鲜问题，希望也许可以在本届大会上达成谅解，完全而无条件地结束朝鲜战争。这是首要问题。必须让人有机会来从各方面讨论这个问题。让代表们可能表示的不同的政治见解和态度明朗化起来。但是，现在有人向我们建议尽速结束这个问题，让朝鲜流血惨剧继续进行下去。苏联代表团认为这样的建议是不对的，并且认为它限制了一个需要讨论的非常重要的问题。维辛斯基最后表示，苏联代表团坚持发言登记不要在三日截止。
    在结束这个问题的讨论的时候，委员会以四十票的多数通过了一个得到苏联代表团支持的建议，就是在三月四日截止发言登记。
