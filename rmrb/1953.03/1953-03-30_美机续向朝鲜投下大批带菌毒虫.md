Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 29th: The Korean Central News Agency reported on the 27th that on March 10th, 11th, and 12th, U.S. planes again dropped large numbers of germ-carrying insects on various parts of North Pyongan Province - Nyongbyon-up in Nyongbyon County, Sokdong-ri in Kwaksan County, Sangdan-ri in Chongju County, and Cholong-ri in Pakchon County (transliterations). Farmer Li Chun-mo of Sokdong-ri testified: "On the night of March 11th, enemy planes circled over our village many times. As soon as the enemy planes left, we found inchworms, flies, spiders, mosquitoes, and other insects piled up on the snow next to the well. We had not seen these insects gathered together on the snow at all the night before."

Prior to this, on February 26th, U.S. planes dropped germ-carrying insects such as spiders and mayflies on Sangwon-ri, Bukchin County, North Pyongan Province; and on February 14th, they dropped germ-carrying insects on Mapyong-ri, Taechon County. According to statistics, the U.S. aggressor troops have dropped germ-carrying insects in areas of one city and nineteen counties in North Pyongan Province.

The people of North Pyongan Province, with mass action, assisted the epidemic prevention personnel in promptly eliminating the germ-carrying insects dropped by the enemy planes. The epidemic prevention committees in various places have preserved specimens of the germ-carrying insects dropped by the enemy planes as ironclad evidence to expose the U.S. aggressors' continued bacteriological warfare.

    美机续向朝鲜投下大批带菌毒虫
   【新华社平壤二十九日电】朝鲜中央通讯社二十七日报道：三月十日、十一日和十二日，美国飞机又分别对平安北道各地——宁边郡宁边邑、郭山郡石洞里、定州郡上端里、博川郡铁龙里（译音），投下大批带菌毒虫。石洞里农民李春模作证说：“三月十一日夜间，敌机在我村上空盘旋了很多次。敌机一走，我们就在水井旁边的雪地上，发现堆有尺蠖、苍蝇、蜘蛛、蚊子等虫子。在前一个晚上，我们在雪地上根本没有看见过这些聚在一起的虫子。”
    在此以前，美机曾在二月二十六日，对平安北道北镇郡上院里投下蜘蛛、蜉蝣等带菌毒虫；在二月十四日，对泰川郡马平里投下带菌毒虫。据统计，美国侵略军已在平安北道一个市和十九个郡的地区投下了带菌毒虫。
    平安北道人民以群众性的行动，协助防疫人员及时扑灭了敌机投下的带菌毒虫。各地防疫委员会保存了敌机投下的带菌毒虫的标本，作为揭露美国侵略者继续进行细菌战的铁证。
