To the Funeral Committee of Comrade Gottwald of Czechoslovakia:

We are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of President Gottwald, the great leader of the Czechoslovak Republic.

The death of President Gottwald is not only an irreparable loss for the people of Czechoslovakia, but also an irreparable loss for the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and an irreparable loss for peace-loving people all over the world. The people's organizations in the Southwest of China express our deepest condolences with heavy hearts. We must transform grief into strength, strive to consolidate and develop the friendly unity between the Chinese and Czech people, continue to consolidate the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and fight to the end for our common cause—the cause of peace and democracy.
