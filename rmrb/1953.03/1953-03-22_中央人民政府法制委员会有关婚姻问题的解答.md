Central People's Government Legislative Committee Answers Questions on Marriage Issues

Question 1: How should bigamy and concubinage before the implementation of the Marriage Law be handled?

Answer: According to the Marriage Law, marriage is monogamous. As for bigamy and concubinage before the implementation of the Marriage Law, these are problems left over from the old society. Whether or not to divorce depends on the wishes of the woman (wife, concubine). If the woman requests a divorce, the People's Court should approve her request in accordance with the law. If the woman does not have such a request, they should still be allowed to maintain their original cohabitation relationship. When the man requests a divorce, the People's Court may handle it based on the spirit of protecting the interests of women and children, combined with the specific circumstances.

Question 2: How should early marriage after the implementation of the Marriage Law be handled?

Answer: Early marriage is harmful to the health of both men and women, their children, and the entire nation. To avoid the harm of early marriage, Article 4 of the Marriage Law stipulates: "Men must be 20 years old and women must be 18 years old before they can marry." However, after the implementation of the Marriage Law, some areas have not conducted sufficiently extensive and in-depth publicity and education among the masses, resulting in some marriages before the legal age. For these early marriages, they should be educated on the Marriage Law, explaining the harm of early marriage, but they must not be forced to separate. In the future, when men and women marry, they should abide by the regulations that "men must be 20 years old and women must be 18 years old before they can marry." Early marriage is not allowed.

Question 3: After the implementation of the Marriage Law, is it permissible for a man who is inheriting two lines (jian tiao) to marry two wives, or to marry another wife because his wife cannot bear children to continue the family line?

Answer: After the implementation of the Marriage Law, it is bigamy to marry two wives to inherit two lines, or to marry another wife to continue the family line. This is a violation of the Marriage Law and is not permitted.

Question 4: How should child brides adopted before the implementation of the Marriage Law who are not yet married be handled?

Answer: Article 2 of the Marriage Law stipulates, "Child brides are prohibited." Therefore, from the date of implementation of the Marriage Law, child brides cannot be adopted. For child brides adopted before the implementation of the Marriage Law who are not yet married, if the child bride requests to return home, or her parents request to take her back, or the child bride chooses another partner, the man's family must not obstruct her and must not demand the return of the wedding gifts or the living expenses consumed during the period as a child bride. When the child bride reaches the age of marriage with the man, whether or not to marry shall be decided by the man and woman themselves, and no one else may force or arrange the marriage.

Question 5: Can widows freely marry?

Answer: Widows can freely marry. Ridiculing widows for freely marrying is wrong. This is influenced by feudal ideas from the old society and should be corrected. A widow marrying is just as proper as a man marrying after his wife dies. However, this does not mean that all widows must marry; it means that widows can marry, but whether or not they wish to marry should be decided by the widow herself, and no one may interfere.

Question 6: When a widow remarries, can she take away the inheritance she received from her husband?

Answer: When a widow remarries, she can take away the inheritance that should belong to her, and no one can interfere. However, if she has children and does not take it away, she should first ensure that sufficient living expenses are left for the children.

Question 7: What does it mean to extort property in the name of marriage? Why should it be prohibited?

Answer: To extort property in the name of marriage refers to demanding a certain bride price from women, or making the acquisition of property from the other party a condition for marriage, which is essentially a sale of marriage. This treats property as a condition for establishing a marital relationship, thus hindering the principle of marriage based on love and violating the spirit of freedom of marriage. Therefore, after the promulgation of the Marriage Law, it must be prohibited. Kidnapping and selling women as wives is a serious illegal act and should be punished by law. Gifts given by parents or both men and women entirely voluntarily are not considered sale of marriage and are not prohibited.

Question 8: How should the age of marriage be calculated?

Answer: In principle, the age of marriage should be calculated according to "full years," that is, men must be 20 full years old and women must be 18 full years old before they can marry. However, to take into account the current actual situation, it can also be calculated according to "calendar years," that is, men 20 calendar years old and women 18 calendar years old can also marry. This is the minimum age for marriage, and does not prevent men and women from voluntarily raising the age of marriage or raising the age of marriage in certain special circumstances.

Question 9: Why is it necessary to register with the People's Government to get married? Is it necessary to register retroactively for marriages that occurred after the implementation of the Marriage Law but were not registered?

Answer: The Marriage Law stipulates: "Marriage shall be registered by both men and women in person at the local (district, township) People's Government." This is so that the People's Government can specifically ascertain: whether the marriage is voluntary on the part of both men and women? Whether the age of marriage has been reached? Whether it is a sale of marriage? Whether it conforms to the monogamous system? Whether there is any violation of the regulations prohibiting marriage between relatives? If, after investigation, it is found to be legal, registration will be approved, a marriage certificate will be issued, and legal protection will be given. At the same time, it can enable men and women to carefully consider the issue of marriage before marriage, better consolidate the relationship between husband and wife after marriage, and seriously handle family issues. Therefore, marriage requires both men and women to register in person with the People's Government.

After the implementation of the Marriage Law, it is inappropriate not to register for marriage when marriage registration agencies have been established. Those who are in fact married but only lack marriage registration procedures are still considered to be in a marital relationship and do not need to retroactively register. If they voluntarily request to retroactively register, they can also retroactively register and be issued a marriage certificate. After the movement to implement the Marriage Law in March 1953, when men and women marry, both parties should abide by the marriage registration system and register.

Question 10: Is it necessary to hold a ceremony for marriage?

Answer: As long as both men and women go to the local (district, township) People's Government to complete the marriage registration procedures and obtain a marriage certificate, it is a legal marriage. As for whether to hold a wedding ceremony, it is up to the man and woman to decide voluntarily.

Question 11: Is engagement a necessary procedure for marriage?

Answer: Engagement is not a necessary procedure for marriage. Those who voluntarily engage should be allowed to engage, but others must not force or arrange it.

Question 12: What is the content of family property?

Answer: Family property mainly includes the following three types: (1) Pre-marital property of men and women; (2) Property obtained during the joint life of husband and wife, including property obtained through the labor of both or one party, inheritance or gifted property obtained by both or one party during this period; (3) Property of minor children (such as land and other property obtained by children during the land reform).

Question 13: Who are illegitimate children? Why is it stipulated that the biological father's obligation to raise and educate illegitimate children lasts until they are 18 years old?

Answer: Illegitimate children refer to children born to men and women who are not in a marital relationship, that is, so-called illegitimate children in the old society. Although illegitimate children are born from improper sexual behavior between men and women, this improper sexual behavior should be the responsibility of the biological parents of the illegitimate children, and not the responsibility of the illegitimate children. Therefore, illegitimate children, like legitimate children, are members of society and should be given equal protection. Because the old society discriminated against illegitimate children, the biological fathers of illegitimate children often did not care about the upbringing and education of illegitimate children. In order to protect the interests of illegitimate children and enable them to be raised and educated into adults, Article 15 of the Marriage Law stipulates: "The biological father shall bear all or part of the necessary living expenses and education expenses for the children until the children are 18 years old."

Question 14: If one party firmly demands a divorce, should the divorce be granted immediately?

Answer: If one party firmly demands a divorce, the People's Court should grant the divorce if mediation is unsuccessful and it is indeed impossible to continue maintaining the marital relationship. If mediation is unsuccessful, but the facts prove that the two parties have not reached the point where they truly cannot continue to cohabit, the divorce may not be approved.

Question 15: If a divorce is granted by a court judgment, is it necessary to go through divorce registration procedures again?

Answer: If a divorce is granted by a court judgment, it is not necessary to go through divorce registration procedures again.

Question 16: Why is the man's burden heavier in terms of living expenses and education expenses for children and repayment of debts after divorce? If the woman's financial situation is indeed more abundant than the man's, can the woman's burden also be increased?

Answer: Under the general circumstances in China at present, the woman's economic ability is not as good as the man's, so the man should bear more of the financial burden. If the woman's financial situation is indeed more abundant than the man's, she can also bear more of the children's living expenses and education expenses than the man, and she can also repay the debts incurred during the joint life.

Question 17: Why can't the man file for divorce during the woman's pregnancy or within one year after childbirth, but the woman can file for divorce without restriction?

Answer: If the man files for divorce during the woman's pregnancy or just after childbirth, it will be too much of a shock to the woman, and will inevitably seriously affect maternal health and the care of the fetus or infant. Therefore, the Marriage Law prohibits the man from filing for divorce during this period. If the woman files for divorce during this period, it should not be restricted.

Question 18: Why can children request either divorced parent for living expenses and education expenses exceeding what is stipulated in the agreement or judgment?

Answer: The agreement or judgment on children's living expenses and education expenses at the time of divorce is often based on the economic situation of both men and women at that time. After the divorce, the economic situation of both or one party may change at any time, and sometimes it is indeed necessary to increase the children's living expenses and education expenses. Therefore, according to Article 21 of the Marriage Law, "After divorce, the agreement or judgment on children's living expenses and education expenses does not prevent the children from requesting either parent to pay an amount exceeding the original amount agreed upon or judged," children can request either divorced parent for living expenses and education expenses exceeding what is stipulated in the agreement or judgment; both or one parent can also provide subsidies exceeding the original agreement or judgment amount according to their own economic situation and the necessary expenses for the children's life and education.

### 中央人民政府法制委员会有关婚姻问题的解答

    中央人民政府法制委员会有关婚姻问题的解答
    问题一：在婚姻法施行前的重婚、纳妾应如何处理？
    答：依婚姻法规定，婚姻是一夫一妻制的。至于婚姻法施行前的重婚、纳妾，是旧社会遗留下来的问题，是否离婚，要看女方（妻、妾）要求来决定。如女方提出离婚，人民法院应依法准许其请求。如果女方没有这样的要求，就仍应让她们保持原来共同生活的关系。男方提出离婚时，人民法院可根据保护妇女和子女利益的精神，结合具体情况处理之。
    问题二：婚姻法施行后的早婚，应如何处理？
    答：早婚对于男女双方本人、子女和整个民族的健康都有害处。为免除早婚之害，婚姻法第四条规定：“男二十岁，女十八岁，始得结婚。”但由于婚姻法施行后，某些地区向群众广泛深入地宣传教育不够，以致尚有未达婚龄而结婚的。对于这些早婚的男女，应向他们进行婚姻法的教育，说明早婚的害处，但不得强迫他们分居。至于今后男女结婚时，则应遵守“男二十岁，女十八岁，始得结婚”的规定。不得早婚。
    问题三：婚姻法施行后，一子顶两门（兼祧）娶二妻者，或因妻不生子为传后代而再娶一妻者，是否许可？
    答：婚姻法施行后，一子顶两门娶二妻，或为传后代而再娶一妻，都是重婚，都是违反婚姻法的。是不能准许的。
    问题四：在婚姻法施行前的童养媳现在尚未结婚者如何处理？
    答：婚姻法第二条有“禁止童养媳”的规定。所以从婚姻法施行之日起，不可收养童养媳。在婚姻法施行前所收养的童养媳，而现在尚未结婚者，如童养媳要求回家或其父母要求把她接回，或童养媳另择对象，男家不得阻碍并不得索还婚礼和讨取在童养期间消耗的生活费；童养媳与男方达到结婚年龄时，是否结婚，由男女双方自己决定，他人不得强迫包办。
    问题五：寡妇可不可以自由结婚？
    答：寡妇是可以自由结婚的。讥笑寡妇自由结婚是错误的，这是受了旧社会封建思想的影响，应该加以纠正。寡妇结婚，和妻死后男子结婚一样，都是正当的。但这并不是说：凡是寡妇一律都要结婚；而是说：寡妇可以结婚，但是否愿意结婚，应由寡妇本人作主，任何人不得加以干涉。
    问题六：寡妇结婚时，能不能把继承丈夫的遗产带走？
    答：寡妇结婚时，可以把应该归她继承的遗产带走，任何人都不能干涉。但如果她已生有子女，又不带走，应先保证留下子女足够的生活费用。
    问题七：所谓借婚姻关系问题索取财物，是什么意思？为什么要予以禁止？
    答：所谓借婚姻关系问题索取财物，系指：对妇女要一定身价，或以索取对方财物为结婚条件的买卖婚姻，亦即是把财物当成婚姻关系成立的条件，因而妨碍了婚姻以爱情为基础的原则，违背了婚姻自由的精神，所以，婚姻法颁布后，要予以禁止。而拐骗、贩卖妇女与人为妻，则是严重的犯法行为，应受法律制裁。至于父母或男女双方完全是出于自愿赠与的礼物，不得视为买卖婚姻，不在禁止之列。
    问题八：结婚年龄应如何计算？
    答：结婚年龄原则上应照“满岁”算，即男满二十周岁，女满十八周岁，始得结婚；但为照顾当前实际情况，也可以照“年头”算，即男二十个年头，女十八个年头，亦可结婚。这是最低婚龄的规定，并不妨碍男女自愿提高婚龄或在某些特殊情况下提高婚龄的规定。
    问题九：结婚为什么要到人民政府登记？婚姻法施行后结婚没有登记是否必须补行登记？
    答：婚姻法规定：“结婚应男女双方亲到所在地（区、乡）人民政府登记。”为的是人民政府应具体查明：结婚是否出于男女双方自愿？是否已够婚龄，是否买卖婚姻，是否合乎一夫一妻制，有无违背亲属间禁止结婚规定等情况；经查明合法的，准予登记，发给结婚证，给以法律保护。同时可以使男女在婚前慎重考虑结婚问题，婚后更好地巩固夫妻关系，严肃地处理家庭问题。因此，结婚须男女双方亲到人民政府登记。
    婚姻法施行后，婚姻登记机关已建立而不去登记结婚是不应该的。对事实上已结婚而仅欠缺结婚登记手续者仍认为是夫妻关系，可不必补行登记。如其自愿请求补行登记者亦可补行登记，并发给结婚证。在一九五三年三月贯彻婚姻法运动后，男女结婚时，男女双方均应遵守婚姻登记制度，进行登记。
    问题十：结婚是否需要举行仪式？
    答：结婚只要男女双方亲到所在地（区、乡）人民政府办理结婚登记手续，领取结婚证，就是合法的婚姻。至于是否举行结婚仪式，听男女双方自愿。
    问题十一：订婚是否为结婚的必要手续？
    答：订婚不是结婚的必要手续。男女自愿订婚者，听其订婚，但别人不得强迫包办。
    问题十二：家庭财产的内容是什么？
    答：家庭财产主要不外下列三种：（一）男女婚前财产；（二）夫妻共同生活时所得的财产，其中包括双方或一方劳动所得的财产、双方或一方在此时期内所得的遗产或赠与的财产；（三）未成年子女的财产（如土地改革中子女所得的土地及其他财产等）。
    问题十三：非婚生子女是指的什么人？为什么规定生父对于非婚生子女的抚养、教育义务直到十八岁为止？
    答：非婚生子女系指非夫妻关系的男女所生的子女，也即旧社会所谓的私生子女。非婚生子女虽然是不正当的男女性行为所生的子女，但这种不正当的性行为应该由非婚生子女的生父母来负责，而不应该由非婚生子女来负责。因此，非婚生子女和婚生子女一样，都是社会的组织成员，应该给以同等的保护。由于旧社会歧视非婚生子女，非婚生子女的生父往往不管非婚生子女的抚养和教育，婚姻法为了保护非婚生子女的利益，使其被抚养教育成人，所以第十五条规定：“生父应负担子女必需的生活费和教育费全部或一部；直至子女十八岁为止。”
    问题十四：一方坚决要求离婚的，是否即行判决离婚？
    答：人民法院对于一方坚决要求离婚，如经调解无效而又确实不能继续维持夫妻关系的，应准予离婚。如经调解虽然无效，但事实证明他们双方并非到确实不能继续同居的程度，也可以不批准离婚。
    问题十五：经法院判决离婚的，要不要再办离婚登记手续？
    答：经法院判决离婚的，可以不再办理离婚登记手续。
    问题十六：为什么离婚后对于子女的生活费和教育费及债务的偿还，男方的负担都要重些；如女方的经济情况确比男方充裕时，是否女方的负担也可以加重些？
    答：在我国目前一般的情况下，女方的经济能力不如男方，所以男方在经济上应多负担一些。如女方的经济情况确比男方充裕时，也可负担较男方为多的子女生活费和教育费，也可偿还共同生活时所负担的债务。
    问题十七：为什么男方在女方怀孕期间或分娩后一年内不能提出离婚，而女方提出离婚的则可不受限制？
    答：女方怀孕期间或刚分娩后，男方如提出离婚，对女方刺激过大，势必严重地影响母性健康和胎儿或婴儿的保育，所以婚姻法禁止男方于此时期提出离婚。若女方于此时期提出离婚，自应不受限制。
    问题十八：为什么子女可以向离婚的父母任何一方请求超过协议或判决所规定的生活费和教育费？
    答：离婚时，对于子女生活费和教育费的协议或判决，往往是以当时男女双方的经济情况为依据，离婚后，双方或一方的经济情况随时都有变动的可能，而子女的生活费和教育费有时又确有增加的必要；因此，按照婚姻法第二十一条“离婚后，关于子女生活费和教育费的协议或判决，不妨碍子女向父母任何一方提出超过协议或判决原定数额的请求”之规定，子女可以向离婚的父母任何一方请求超过协议或判决所规定的生活费和教育费；父母双方或一方，亦得按自己的经济情况和子女生活和教育的必需费用，给予超过原协议或判决数额的补助。（新华社）
