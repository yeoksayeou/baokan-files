    Self-Criticism of My Bureaucratic and Showy Work Style

    The Henan Daily exposed the incident of our county falsely reporting bumper harvest achievements on January 5th. Instead of facing my mistakes squarely, I had an antagonistic attitude in my thinking, believing that the newspaper's criticism of us was too severe. Now, upon reflection, I realize that this emotion of mine did not stem from the interests of the Party and the people, but from personal interests, fearing the loss of personal face. As a result, I dared not accept criticism in front of the masses and could only play it safe behind closed doors. Later, with the instructions of the prefectural committee and the earnest help of the broad masses, I began to examine my mistakes, organize cadres for study, and conduct criticism and self-criticism.

    The false report of bumper harvest achievements prominently manifested my bad style of bureaucracy and pursuit of personal glory. When I heard the news of the bumper wheat harvest of the Wen Xianglan Agricultural Production Cooperative, without considering the actual situation, I told Comrade Kan Feng, a reporter residing in the Zhuma Lou Township, and others to organize a report. Comrade Kan Feng was conscientious and responsible in his work and discovered that the bumper harvest achievements did not meet the reward standards, and he reported this issue to Jiao Tong, the deputy director of the County Agricultural and Forestry Bureau. Subsequently, Chang Yaozhong of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government made the same report to Yang Guodian, the secretary of the Third District Committee. However, Jiao Tong adopted an irresponsible attitude and did not make a serious report to the county, nor did he confirm the authenticity. At that time, when I heard the news that the bumper harvest achievements of the Wen Xianglan Agricultural Production Cooperative were unreliable, I felt somewhat unhappy and was skeptical of Kan Feng's investigation. During the same period, in an article published in the newspaper about the Su Dianxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative, Lü Jianzhong criticized our county for not being serious enough in handling the bumper harvest issue of the Wen Xianglan Agricultural Production Cooperative. Instead of paying attention to it and seriously examining and dealing with it, I was dissatisfied and said, "Does he mean it's not a bumper harvest just because he says so? What's the basis?" At that time, I thought it would be enough as long as the district dared to take responsibility. As a result, the bumper harvest materials of the Wen Xianglan Agricultural Production Cooperative were reported level by level. After receiving the bumper harvest materials, the prefectural agricultural and forestry bureau and the provincial agricultural and forestry department were suspicious and called and telegraphed our county several times, asking our county to conduct a serious inspection. However, I took a perfunctory attitude, pretending to be responsible, and sent back a telegram with false assurances. At this time, I not only did not feel ashamed, but also felt complacent. When the Wen Xianglan Agricultural Production Cooperative was awarded in October last year, Comrade Cui Shaowu of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry inspected the bumper harvest of the Wen Xianglan Agricultural Production Cooperative again and found suspicious points such as three-tenths more land than there should have been for the bumper yield. He reported this to our county and also made some suggestions in the report. Instead of accepting these suggestions and carefully considering them, I put forward contrary opinions and arbitrarily said, "Even if there are some discrepancies, there won't be many, let's not report it to the Central Government for an award." Comrade Cui Shaowu had no choice but to follow my opinion and awarded the prize, and the Wen Xianglan Agricultural Production Cooperative was rated as a special-class labor model in the county and awarded a yellow ox. In my mind, I always believed that the more model examples that appeared in our county, the greater my contribution would be, and the more famous the models were, the more resounding my reputation would be. Therefore, when I saw that the models had shortcomings, I did not criticize and educate them, and even fabricated achievements for the models, promoting the development of their shortcomings and mistakes.

    Because I have this kind of bad style of bureaucracy, pursuit of personal glory, and deceiving the Party and the people, it has already caused extremely bad consequences for the cause of the Party. Most of the cadres in our county, influenced by my style, are unwilling to concentrate their efforts on doing a good job, but want to bury themselves in writing good reports, reporting good news and not bad news, exaggerating achievements, and covering up shortcomings. Bai Peirong, a cadre in the Second District, said: "The work now is really difficult to do. If you don't know how to brag, you won't be able to do the work. We have also set up the framework and are ready to brag about it." As a result of the bragging, disunity among the cadres was created. The Lower Tang District achieved some success in production work last year, but because the district committee exaggerated the achievements, it caused dissatisfaction among the cadres in various districts, leading to mutual quarrels, which greatly damaged the work.

    The root cause of my mistakes is mainly that I have the individualistic ideas of petty-bourgeois selfishness. I have always liked to hear good things and disliked hearing bad things. I like to hear about achievements and am dissatisfied with shortcomings. I regard the achievements in my work as my own achievements, not as the achievements of the correct leadership of the higher-level Party committee and the active efforts of the broad masses of cadres and the people. I often feel complacent, thinking that our county's work is better than any other county, that the foundation of the work is good, and that the morale of the masses is high, and that any work can be completed as long as an order is given. Therefore, I lack in-depth and detailed research and investigation into my work, and only blindly and recklessly do things. In addition, I have not done a good job in carrying out criticism, especially bottom-up criticism. Many mistakes have occurred in the work below, and I cannot detect them. Even if I detect them, I cannot overcome and correct them in time, and the mistakes continue to develop. In the "Three-Anti" movement, although I also superficially examined my mistakes, I actually went through the motions, so I did not receive a profound education from the "Three-Anti" movement, and I did not realize the seriousness of my mistakes early. When the higher-level gave me instructions, I hid my mistakes, fearing that the higher-level would criticize me if they found out. In this way, my mistakes developed. Another reason for my mistakes is that my studies are very poor, especially my political theory studies. I lack political and theoretical knowledge and cannot correctly grasp policies.

    Now I deeply realize the seriousness of my mistakes. In addition to sincerely accepting criticism and deeply apologizing to the masses, I also request the higher-level Party and the People's Government to give me a severe punishment in order to restore the Party's influence among the masses. In the future, I will also examine myself in my work, strengthen my studies, and do a good job. (Reprinted from Henan Daily)

    检查我的官僚主义和风头主义作风
    中共鲁山县委书记
    鲁山县县长
    王延太
    河南日报在一月五日揭发了我县假报丰产成绩的事件，我不但没有正视自己的错误，反而在思想上存在着对抗的情绪，认为报纸对我们批评得太厉害。现在检查起来，我这种情绪完全不是从党和人民的利益出发，而是从个人利益出发，怕失掉个人的面子。这样，我就不敢在群众面前接受批评，只好在屋内看风驶船。后来经过地委的指示和广大群众的亲切的帮助，我才开始检查自己的错误，组织干部学习，开展批评和自我批评。
    假报丰产事件突出地表现了我的官僚主义和风头主义的恶劣作风。我听到文香兰农业生产合作社小麦丰产的消息时，毫不考虑实际情况如何，就转告住马楼乡的记者阚枫等同志前往组织报道。阚枫同志对工作认真负责，发现了丰产成绩不够奖励标准的问题，并把这个问题向我县农林科焦桐副科长作了汇报。此后中央农业部常耀中也向三区区委书记杨国殿作了同样的汇报。可是焦桐采取了不负责任的态度，没有向县作认真的汇报，也没有向县肯定真假。当时我听到文香兰农业生产合作社丰产成绩不可靠的消息，内心就有些不高兴，对阚枫调查的情况也半信半疑。同一时期，吕建中在报纸上发表的关于苏殿选农业生产合作社的问题的文章中，批评我县在处理文香兰农业生产合作社丰产问题不够严肃，我不但没有重视起来，认真检查处理，反而不满地说：“他说不丰产就算不丰产了？有什么根据？”当时我认为只要区上敢负责就算。结果就把文香兰农业生产合作社的丰产材料逐级上报了。专署农林科和省农林厅接到丰产材料后，发生怀疑，几次向我县打电话、拍电报，要我县认真检查。但是我却以敷衍了事的态度，假装负责的样子，回了一个电报，作了虚伪的保证。这时我心里不但不感到惭愧，还觉得洋洋得意。去年十月给文香兰农业生产合作社发奖时，省农林厅崔绍武同志又检查了文香兰农业生产合作社的丰产情况，查出丰产地多出三分等可疑之处，又给我县作了汇报，并在汇报中提出一些意见。我不但没有接受这些意见，加以慎重考虑，反而提出相反的意见，武断地说：“就是有点出入也不会多，不要向中央报奖算了。”崔绍武同志没有办法，最后就依照我的意见发了奖，并把文香兰评成县特等劳动模范，奖给一头黄牛。在我心目中，总认为我县出现模范越多，我的功劳也越大，模范越著名，我的名誉也就越响亮。所以我看到模范有缺点，也不加以批评和教育，甚至还给模范捏造成绩，助长其缺点和错误的发展。
    由于我存在着这种官僚主义、风头主义和欺骗党与人民的恶劣作风，已经给党的事业造下了极坏的恶果。我县大多数干部受了我这种作风的影响，就不愿集中精力把工作搞好，而想埋头把报告写好，报喜不报忧，夸大成绩，掩盖缺点。二区干部柏培荣说：“现在的工作可真难作了，不会吹不会说，就工作不成了。我们也搭好架子啦，准备吹它一伙。”吹的结果，又造成了干部之间的不团结。下汤区去年生产工作有些成绩，因为区委夸大成绩，引起各区干部的不满，互相闹意见，使工作受了很大损失。
    我犯错误的根源，最主要的是我存在小资产阶级的自私自利的个人主义思想。我是一贯爱听好的，不爱听坏的，听到成绩就喜欢，听到缺点就不满。我并把工作中的成绩看成是自己的成绩，没有看成是上级党委正确领导和广大干部、群众积极努力的成绩。我往往沾沾自喜，自以为我县工作比任何县都好，工作基础好，群众情绪高，啥工作只要下一道命令就能完成。因此我对工作就缺乏深入细致的研究和调查，只顾盲目地乱干，加上没有很好地开展批评特别是自下而上的批评，下边工作发生很多错误，我也不能发觉，就是发觉后也不能及时克服和纠正，而使错误继续发展下去。在“三反”运动中，我虽然也表面上检查了自己的错误，但实际上是敷衍了事地过关，所以没有受到“三反”的深刻的教育，没有及早认识自己错误的严重性。上级给我指示，我还把自己的错误隐瞒起来，只怕上级知道了要受批评，这样就使我的错误发展了。我犯错误的另外一个原因是学习很差，特别是对政治理论学习差，缺乏政治理论水平，不能正确地掌握政策。
    现在我深刻地认识到我的错误的严重性，我除诚恳地接受批评和深刻向群众检讨外，并请求上级党和人民政府给我以严重的处分，以挽回党在群众中的影响。今后我还要在工作中检查自己，加强学习，把工作做好。（转载河南日报）
