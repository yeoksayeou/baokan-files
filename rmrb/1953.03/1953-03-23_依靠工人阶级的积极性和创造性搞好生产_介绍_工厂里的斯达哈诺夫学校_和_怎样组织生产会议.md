The state's large-scale economic construction has already begun, and the central task of trade union organizations is, under the unified leadership of the Party, to mobilize the broad masses of employees to improve production and ensure the completion of the state's production plans. In order to accomplish this task well, trade union organizations across the country are learning from the experience of the Northeast 53 Factory. The experience of the 53 Factory tells us that the work of trade union organizations must be centered on production, and that relying on the strength and wisdom of the working class and their high level of initiative and creativity to manage enterprises is an important method for improving production. The two books, "Stakhanov Schools in Factories" and "How to Organize Production Meetings," introduce specific Soviet methods in this regard. Therefore, studying these two books will greatly help us learn from the experience of the 53 Factory.

In the Soviet Union, Stakhanov schools are one of the basic forms of promoting advanced production experience. "Stakhanov Schools in Factories" is a book that introduces how to organize Stakhanov schools in enterprises. It vividly and specifically explains the nature and content of Stakhanov schools, and the matters that should be paid attention to when organizing Stakhanov schools.

Stakhanov schools are different from ordinary schools; they are a simple way to conduct technical education. The basic form of Stakhanov schools is for advanced workers to demonstrate their operation methods to workers in the workshop and at their workstations. This simple teaching method is most easily accepted by ordinary workers and enables them to learn advanced working methods in the shortest possible time. In the Soviet Union, Stakhanov schools are one of the most effective ways to promote advanced production experience and a powerful means of improving the technical level of workers. This method very appropriately embodies Stalin's principle of competition: "The advanced provide comradely assistance to the backward in order to achieve universal improvement." Therefore, Stakhanov schools have become one of the forms of socialist competition.

Promoting the experience of advanced producers is a very important task of trade union organizations; therefore, trade union organizations must take the main responsibility for leading Stakhanov schools. The factory committee supervises and checks the implementation of the Stakhanov school plan; the workshop committee and the trade union group leaders provide specific leadership for each school, participate in formulating subjects, selecting teachers, and designating learners, create favorable conditions for the school, and report on the work of each school on time.

The plan for Stakhanov schools is drafted by the workshop committee in conjunction with advanced workers, foremen, and workshop directors. The plan should be realistic, simple, and clear. The subjects of study should be able to solve the most important problems in current production tasks, and the methods of study should also be diverse. Each school's teaching plan has its own characteristics. Experience has proven that only a realistic plan can enable Stakhanov schools to play the greatest role in production.

When organizing Stakhanov schools in workshops with complex operating procedures, in addition to the advanced workers serving as teachers demonstrating operating methods at their workstations, attention must also be paid to improving workers' theoretical level. When organizing such schools, some auxiliary teaching materials should be prepared, such as relevant charts, models, and drawings. The study time should be longer.

In each school, in addition to designating an advanced worker as a teacher, there should also be an instructor. The instructor is usually a foreman or deputy foreman who helps the teacher with theoretical explanations and production guidance.

Providing teachers and instructors with necessary assistance is an important factor in running Stakhanov schools well. Engineering and technical personnel participating in the work of Stakhanov schools can help advanced workers summarize their own experience. This can not only make it easier for learners to learn the subjects they need to study but also enable teachers to improve their own theories. Therefore, it is necessary to equip each school with engineering and technical personnel.

This book is not long, but its content is very rich and can give us great inspiration in promoting advanced production experience.

"How to Organize Production Meetings" is also a book that is not long but has rich content. It succinctly describes the role of production meetings in enterprises and the working experience of organizing production meetings.

To improve enterprise production work, one cannot rely solely on administrative leaders and engineering and technical personnel; one must also rely on the broad masses of employees. Production meetings are a means of mobilizing the masses and enabling them to exert their creative initiative. In the Soviet Union, production meetings are an effective way for workers to participate in the management of the national economy. Through production meetings, the broad masses of employees can expose shortcomings in enterprises and propose ways to correct them. The broad masses of employees discuss administrative work plans at production meetings, point out errors and shortcomings in the plans, and put forward various suggestions for improving production work. This can not only concentrate everyone's wisdom to continuously improve enterprise work but also enable everyone to complete production plans with a sense of ownership and labor attitude. Shvernik, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, once pointed out: "Production meetings... should become the most important means of striving to complete industrial and financial plans." Production meetings are a concrete method of "relying on the working class to improve production."

Listening to the opinions of the masses and supporting the creative initiative of the masses is the sacred duty of trade union organizations. Production meetings must be led by trade union organizations. However, it must be noted that the leaders of enterprises and workshops must also be responsible for the resolutions of production meetings, just like the trade union organizations. Therefore, the leaders of enterprise workshops and engineering and technical personnel must participate in production meetings and listen to the opinions of the masses. Administrative representatives must explain at the end of the meeting which suggestions can be implemented, which cannot be implemented, and the reasons why they cannot be implemented.

Before convening a production meeting, the trade union organization must consult with workers, foremen, technicians, administrative representatives, and production activists in advance to formulate a concrete draft of suggestions for discussion at the meeting. With concrete discussion materials provided to the participants, the meeting will proceed more smoothly.

Production meetings must have detailed records. The person responsible for recording must be familiar with the production situation. The record should include: the date of the meeting, the number of attendees, the issues discussed, the names and positions of the reporters and supplementary reporters, and the resolutions passed by the meeting. The record of the meeting is very important. Experience has proven that if production meetings are not recorded, the meeting is equal to nothing, and the trade union organization cannot check the implementation of the meeting resolutions. Not only should there be records of the meeting situation, but there should also be records of the implementation of various suggestions. The latter record is the responsibility of the administration. After a suggestion is accepted by the administration, the leader of the enterprise or workshop must issue an order, pointing out the executor of the suggestion and stipulating the implementation deadline.

Production meetings take the following forms: production meetings of production teams, production meetings of work sections, production meetings of workshops, and production meetings of the entire factory. Group production meetings are the most important and must be held regularly; in the Soviet Union, they are usually held every ten days.

All of these issues are introduced in great detail and concretely in this book. After reading this book, we can correctly recognize the importance of production meetings and learn the specific methods of organizing production meetings.

    依靠工人阶级的积极性和创造性搞好生产
    ——介绍“工厂里的斯达哈诺夫学校”和“怎样组织生产会议”

    国家的大规模经济建设已经开始，工会组织的中心任务，就是在党的统一领导下，发动广大职工群众搞好生产，保证完成国家的生产计划。为了很好地完成这一任务，全国工会组织都在学习东北五三工厂的经验。五三工厂的经验告诉我们：工会组织的工作必须以生产为中心，而依靠工人阶级的力量和智慧、高度积极性和创造性来管理企业，则是搞好生产的重要方法。“工厂里的斯达哈诺夫学校”和“怎样组织生产会议”两本书就是介绍苏联在这方面的具体方法的。因此，学习这两本书对我们学习五三工厂的经验，是会有极大的帮助的。
    在苏联，斯达哈诺夫学校是推广先进生产经验的基本形式之一。“工厂里的斯达哈诺夫学校”就是一本介绍在企业里如何组织斯达哈诺夫学校的书。它生动地、具体地说明了斯达哈诺夫学校的性质、内容和组织斯达哈诺夫学校应该注意的事项。
    斯达哈诺夫学校和一般的学校不一样，它是一种简单的进行技术教育的方式。斯达哈诺夫学校的基本形式，就是先进工人在车间里、在工作位置上，给工人表演自己的操作法。这种简单的教学方法，最容易为一般工人所接受，能够使他们在最短时间内学会先进的工作方法。在苏联，斯达哈诺夫学校是推广先进生产经验最有效的方式之一，也是提高工人技术水平的一个有力手段。这种方法非常恰当地体现了斯大林的竞赛原则：“先进者给予落后者以同志的帮助，以便达到普遍的提高”。所以斯达哈诺夫学校也就成为社会主义竞赛的形式之一。
    推广先进生产者的经验，是工会组织一项很重要的任务；因此，工会组织就必须负起领导斯达哈诺夫学校的主要责任。工厂委员会监督、检查斯达哈诺夫学校计划的执行；车间委员会和工会小组长对每个学校进行具体的领导，参加拟定课目、选聘教师和指定学习者的工作，为学校创造有利的条件，按时报告各学校的工作情况。
    斯达哈诺夫学校的计划，是由车间委员会会同先进工人、工长、车间主任来拟定的。计划要切合实际情况，而且要简单明确。学习的课目要能解决当前生产任务中最主要的问题，学习的方法也要多种多样。每个学校的教学计划都有其自己的特点。经验证明：只有实事求是的计划才能使斯达哈诺夫学校在生产中发挥最大的效用。
    在有复杂的操作过程的车间里组织斯达哈诺夫学校，除由担任教师的先进工人在工作位置上表演操作法外，还必须注意提高工人的理论水平。组织这种学校应该准备一些辅助教材，如有关的图表、模型和图样等。学习时间要规定得长一点。
    每个学校里，除指定一位先进工人担任教师外，还要有一个指导员。指导员通常由工长或副工长担任，帮助教师作理论上的说明和生产上的指导。
    给教师和指导员以必要的帮助，是搞好斯达哈诺夫学校的一个重要因素。工程技术人员参加斯达哈诺夫学校的工作，可以帮助先进工人来总结自己的经验。这样，既能使学习的人容易学会要学习的课目，又能使担任教师的人提高自己的理论。因此，在每一个学校里配备工程技术人员是非常必要的。
    这本书篇幅不大，但内容很充实，在推广先进生产经验的工作方面能够给我们很大的启示。
    “怎样组织生产会议”也是一本篇幅不大、内容充实的书。它扼要地叙述了生产会议在企业中的作用和组织生产会议的工作经验。
    要搞好企业生产工作，不能光靠行政领导人员和工程技术人员，还必须依靠广大的职工群众。生产会议就是动员群众，使他们发挥创造积极性的手段。在苏联，生产会议是劳动者参加管理国民经济的有效方式。通过生产会议，职工群众可以揭发企业中的缺点，并且可以提出纠正缺点的办法。职工群众在生产会议上讨论行政的工作计划，指出计划中的错误和缺点，提出各种改进生产工作的建议。这样，既可以集中大家的智慧来不断地改进企业工作，又可以使大家用主人翁的劳动态度来完成生产计划。全苏工会中央理事会主席什维尔尼克曾指出：“生产会议……应该成为争取完成工业财政计划的最重要的手段。”生产会议是“依靠工人阶级搞好生产”的具体方法。
    听取群众意见，支持群众的创造积极性是工会组织的神圣职责。生产会议必须由工会组织来领导。但必须注意，企业和车间的领导人也要和工会组织一样地对生产会议的决议负责。因此，企业车间的领导人和工程技术人员必须参加生产会议，听取群众的意见。行政的代表在会议结束时要说明哪些建议能实行，哪些不能实行和不能实行的理由。
    在召开生产会议以前，工会组织要预先和工人、工长、技术人员、行政代表和生产积极分子商谈，拟出具体的建议草案，以便提到会议上讨论。有了具体的讨论材料提供给参加会议的人，会议的进行就更顺利了。
    生产会议一定要有详细的纪录。担任纪录的人要熟习生产情况。纪录中记载：会议日期、出席人数、讨论的问题、报告人和补充报告人的姓名和职务以及会议通过的决议。会议的纪录是非常重要的。经验证明：如果生产会议不作纪录，会就等于白开，工会组织就无法检查会议决议的执行情况。不但对会议情形要有纪录，对各项建议的执行情况也要有纪录。后项纪录是由行政负责的。建议为行政接受后，企业或车间的领导人就要发布命令，指出建议的执行人，规定执行的期限。
    生产会议有以下各种形式：生产小组的生产会议、工段生产会议、车间生产会议、全厂生产会议。小组生产会议是最重要的，必须定期召开；在苏联，通常是每十天召开一次。
    以上这些问题，在这本书里，都有很详细、很具体的介绍。我们读了这本书，能够正确地认识生产会议的重要性，能够学到组织生产会议的具体方法。
