He said: Since the China Peace Committee issued instructions last December on continuing to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding North Korea, the people of the whole country have warmly responded to this call. Among them, theater troupes and drama workers from various places have sent letters to the committee, requesting to go to the front lines in North Korea to conduct consolation performances. In order to make the consolation performances in North Korea more organized and planned, a joint meeting of the Standing Committee and representatives of relevant departments was specially convened to discuss this issue. After Guo Moruo's speech, Comrade Zhou Weizhi, a member of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, reported on the organization and performance plan of the art troupe going to North Korea.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: Decision of the China Peace Committee on Organizing Art Troupes to Visit and Console North Korea in Batches

(Passed by the Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the China Peace Committee)

    Since the American imperialists rejected the demand of peace-loving people all over the world for an immediate ceasefire in Korea and attempted to expand their aggression, this committee issued instructions on December 22nd last year, calling on the people of the whole country to continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding North Korea, to make efforts to support the front, and to smash the American imperialists' conspiracy to expand aggression. After this call was issued, it immediately received a widespread and enthusiastic response throughout the country. Among them, literary and art workers from all over the country responded to the call for consolation performances in North Korea, and wrote letters to the committee one after another, vying to go to North Korea to perform. This enthusiasm of literary and art workers across the country for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding North Korea, that is, the spirit of high patriotism and internationalism, has been praised and welcomed by the people of the whole country and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    In order to make the consolation performances in North Korea more organized and planned, it is now decided to organize the China Peace Committee's art troupe to visit and console North Korea. The composition and activities of the troupe are stipulated as follows:

    (1) The China Peace Committee's art troupe to visit and console North Korea will consist of six groups from the central government (including North China), Northeast, East China, Central South, Northwest, and Southwest.

    (2) The composition of each group shall be jointly responsible by the China Peace Committee and the general sub-committees in major administrative regions, together with the relevant cultural departments.

    (3) The departure for performances in North Korea will be carried out in batches. The departure date will be arranged by the general sub-committees of the Peace Committee in major administrative regions in consultation with the general committee, with the first batch departing in the near future.

    (4) The duration of each batch of consolation performances is tentatively set at two months.

    (5) Before departure, each group should make appropriate selections and arrangements for the plays (including Peking opera, local opera, spoken drama), movies, ballad singing, song and dance, acrobatics and other programs to be performed. The content should include historical dramas and folk ballads and acrobatics that are rich in national characteristics and express the great character of the people, as well as other programs that reflect the development of national construction and the improvement of people's lives, the love of our people for the Volunteers and the enthusiastic support for the front, and the great patriotism and internationalism of our people. At the same time, each program must have the necessary artistic level and should be adapted to the conditions of performing on the battlefield.

    We call on all literary and art groups that have not participated in this overseas performance to actively prepare their own programs suitable for performing in North Korea, so that they can participate in the work of overseas performance at any time.

    At the same time, we call on all patriotic literary and art workers across the country to mobilize and create better dramas, ballads and other programs for our dear Volunteers, so as to victoriously complete the glorious task of performing in North Korea.

    （中国人民抗美援朝总会常务委员会扩大会议通过）
    由于美帝国主义者拒绝全世界爱好和平的人民关于立即在朝鲜实现停战的要求，并妄图扩大侵略，本会曾于去年十二月二十二日发出指示，号召全国人民继续加强抗美援朝工作，努力支援前线，粉碎美帝国主义扩大侵略的阴谋。这一号召发出后，立即在全国范围内，获得普遍的热烈响应。其中，各地文艺工作者为响应赴朝慰问演出的号召，纷纷致函本会，争先恐后地要求赴朝献演。全国文艺工作者的这种抗美援朝的热情，即高度的爱国主义与国际主义的精神，已受到全国人民和中国人民志愿军的赞扬和欢迎。
    为使赴朝慰问演出能更有组织、有计划地进行起见，兹特决定组织中国人民抗美援朝总会赴朝慰问文艺工作团。其组成及其活动方法等项事宜，规定如下：
    （一）中国人民抗美援朝总会赴朝慰问文艺工作团由中央（包括华北）、东北、华东、中南、西北、西南六个团组成。
    （二）各团的组成，由中国人民抗美援朝总会及各大行政区总分会会同有关文化部门共同负责。
    （三）赴朝演出采取分批集中出发的办法，出发日期由各大行政区抗美援朝总分会与总会联系后排定，其中第一批于最近期内出发。
    （四）每批慰问演出的期限预定为两个月。
    （五）出发前各团应将准备演出的戏剧（包括京剧、地方剧、话剧）、电影、曲艺、歌舞、杂技等节目加以适当的选择和安排，其内容应包括富有民族色彩和表现伟大人民性格的历史剧和民间曲艺、杂技，以及足以反映国家建设的发展和人民生活的改善，我国人民热爱志愿军和热烈支援前线的情况，我国人民的伟大爱国主义和国际主义精神等其他的节目。同时每一节目必须具有必要的艺术水平，并应适应在战地演出的条件。
    我们号召凡未参加这次出国献演的文艺团体，均应积极准备自己的适合于赴朝献演的节目，以便能随时参加出国献演的工作。
    我们同时号召全国爱国的文艺工作者们，动员起来，为我们亲爱的志愿军创作出更好的戏剧、曲艺等节目，以便胜利地完成赴朝献演的光荣任务。
          一九五三年三月二十八日
