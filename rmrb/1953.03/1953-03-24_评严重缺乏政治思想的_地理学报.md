Critique of "Acta Geographica Sinica" for Seriously Lacking Political Thought
    Chen Tianmin

    "Acta Geographica Sinica" is a national academic journal about geographical science. Since the national liberation, "Acta Geographica Sinica" has published three volumes (Volume 16, Volume 17, Volume 18, Issues 1 & 2 combined, and Issues 3 & 4 combined, a total of four books). Although it has achieved some results, such as publishing some academic research on climate, geomorphology, and hydrology, field investigation reports, and introductions to the organization and activities of the Soviet Geographical Society, in its main aspect, it has serious shortcomings and errors. The positions, viewpoints, and methods of many articles are very wrong. For example, Ren Meie's "Geographical Distribution of Agricultural Crop Productivity in Sichuan Province" ("Acta Geographica Sinica" Volume 16) takes a bourgeois stance, using formalistic viewpoints and abstract methods to explain the problem (see the author's criticism of the article, "Acta Geographica Sinica" Volume 18, Issues 3 & 4). Xu Jinzhi's "A Summary of Past International Geographical Congresses," as pointed out in Sun Jingzhi's "Comments on the Review of Xu Jinzhi's 'A Summary of Past International Geographical Congresses'," "is a thoroughly reactionary article, with almost every sentence carrying poison and every argument being reactionary" ("Acta Geographica Sinica" Volume 18, Issues 3 & 4). Cao Wanru's "Relative Relief of Eastern Fujian Province" ("Acta Geographica Sinica" Volume 16) also raises significant questions about the research methods adopted. Liu Enlan's "Social Economy of the Four Tusi in Lifan Highland, Sichuan" ("Acta Geographica Sinica" Volume 17) is an old manuscript, not only full of Han chauvinism and geographical determinism, but also depicting the actual situation under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Zhao Songqiao and Bai Xiuzhen's "Preliminary Study of Nanjing Urban Geography" adopted a set of methods used by the bourgeoisie to study urban geography, neglecting the role of urban geography in economic regions, and therefore failing to explain the future development direction of Nanjing's urban geography.

    Volume 18, Issues 3 & 4 published three critical articles and three self-criticisms. With just a little attention, we can see that these three self-criticisms have a common point: they all say that their self-criticisms are preliminary and not profound enough, actually adopting a perfunctory attitude towards the self-criticism. In particular, the self-criticism of the "Acta Geographica Sinica" Editorial Board pushes its own errors onto objective reasons. For example, it says that it "lacked a certain review system, so that it made unprincipled and harmonious comments and only proposed some unimportant, trivial opinions and superficial rhetorical modifications on the works with wrong standpoints and viewpoints, and ignored the fundamental principled errors." But why was there a lack of a review system? It didn't fundamentally explain. At the same time, not only that, but the review also said that they "still had some deviations in unprincipled care for unity during the review process." But as for the authors of the above-mentioned criticized articles, such as Ren Meie, Xu Jinzhi, Liu Enlan, etc., they themselves are directors and alternate directors of the Geographical Society, that is, the editor-in-chief and editors of "Acta Geographica Sinica." May I ask, what kind of people are they "taking care of" in their so-called "unprincipled care for unity"? From this, we can see the extent to which the "Acta Geographica Sinica" Editorial Board is irresponsible for its work!

    Why does "Acta Geographica Sinica" have such serious shortcomings and errors? The main reason is that "Acta Geographica Sinica" has consistently neglected political and ideological leadership. Although at the beginning of the establishment of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Government Administration Council's Committee of Culture and Education proposed eleven "basic tasks" to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, among which the particularly important ones were "to determine the viewpoint of scientific research serving the people and closely cooperate with practice"; "to strengthen the political study of researchers so that they can grasp the viewpoints and methods of Marxism-Leninism." However, "Acta Geographica Sinica," which is led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has ignored these things. It has neither published any scientific papers introducing the new geographical theory, nor has it made any systematic criticisms of bourgeois geography, nor has it organized geographers from various regions to conduct Marxist-Leninist studies. How can it shoulder the arduous task of guiding geographical science and geographical scientists?

    Secondly, the "Acta Geographica Sinica" Editorial Board lacks a correct understanding of criticism and self-criticism. Criticism and self-criticism are the most effective weapons to improve and promote work. In criticism and self-criticism, scientific workers must have irreconcilable seriousness towards errors and shortcomings, and must not conceal, quibble, or evade errors and shortcomings. But unfortunately, Xu Jinzhi's "My Review of the Article 'A Summary of Past International Geographical Congresses'," as pointed out by Sun Jingzhi, includes these three characteristics: one, "covering up errors, avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial"; two, "insisting on errors, launching a counterattack"; three, "being perfunctory and unwilling to correct mistakes" ("Acta Geographica Sinica" Volume 18, Issues 3 & 4). At the same time, "Acta Geographica Sinica" does not make a deep self-criticism for publishing such wrong articles, but adopts an extremely dishonest attitude. Such an approach is obviously treating criticism and self-criticism with bourgeois ideology. As a result, it not only hinders itself but also hinders the progress of geographical science.

    Thirdly, it has been more than a year since the publication of Volume 16 of "Acta Geographica Sinica" before colleagues in the geographical community have raised criticisms of the wrong articles. This shows that among many of our geographers, there are still serious remnants of liberalism and "teacher-student relationships." They flatter each other and do not offend each other. Students often dare not criticize their teachers. Some people, even if they find errors in published works, especially "Acta Geographica Sinica" published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences or published works belonging to elders, dare not frankly raise criticisms. Of course, this attitude is also extremely wrong. Comrade Stalin once pointed out: "If we do not conduct self-criticism sincerely and frankly, and do not correct our mistakes sincerely and openly, we will block the road to progress." Only by being good at using criticism and self-criticism can we correct all wrong tendencies, can we save the decline in scientific level, and promote the continuous prosperity and development of science.

    In short, the shortcomings and errors that have existed in "Acta Geographica Sinica" for three years are intolerable. Chairman Mao once taught us, "The previous mistakes must be exposed, without sentimentality. We must analyze and criticize the bad things of the past with a scientific attitude, so that the subsequent work will be more cautious and done better. This is the meaning of 'learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones'." Therefore, it is hoped that the "Acta Geographica Sinica" Editorial Board will sufficiently estimate the past mistakes and strive to overcome them in future work. At the same time, it is suggested that the Chinese Academy of Sciences strengthen its leadership over "Acta Geographica Sinica" so that "Acta Geographica Sinica" becomes a highly political, ideological, and scientific academic journal, and plays its due role in the great cause of national construction.

    评严重缺乏政治思想的“地理学报”
    陈天民
    “地理学报”是一个全国性的关于地理科学的学术刊物。全国解放以来，“地理学报”共出了三卷（第十六卷，第十七卷，第十八卷第一、二合期和第三、四合期，共四本）。虽然它有一点成绩，如刊载了一些关于气候、地文和水文等学术的研究，实地调查报告，以及苏联地理学会的组织和活动的介绍等，但就其主要的一面来说，它却存在着严重的缺点和错误。其中很多文章的立场、观点和方法都是非常错误的。例如，任美锷的“四川省农作物生产力的地理分布”一文（“地理学报”第十六卷），就是站在资产阶级的立场，用形式主义的观点和抽象的方法来说明问题的（见作者对该文的批评，“地理学报”第十八卷三、四合期）。徐近之的“国际地理大会历次概况”一文，正如孙敬之的“对于徐近之‘国际地理大会历次概况’检讨的意见”一文指出，“是一篇反动透顶的文章，几乎每一句话都带有毒素，每一个论点都是反动的”（“地理学报”第十八卷三、四合期）。曹婉如的“福建省东部的相对地势”一文（“地理学报”第十六卷），其所采取的研究方法也大有商榷的必要。刘恩兰的“四川理番高地四土之社会经济”（“地理学报”第十七卷）是一篇旧稿，不仅充满着大汉族主义和地理环境决定论的色彩，并且所描写的实际上完全是国民党反动统治时代的情况。赵松乔、白秀珍的“南京都市地理初步研究”一文是取用了资产阶级研究都市地理的一套方法，忽视了都市地理在经济区域中的作用，因此对南京都市地理未来的发展方向就无法加以说明。
    第十八卷第三、四合期刊出了三篇批评文章和三篇自我检讨。只要稍稍注意一下，我们就可看出这三篇检讨有一个共通之点：都说自己的检讨是初步的、不深刻的，实际上是对检讨采取着应付敷衍的态度。特别是“地理学报”编辑委员会的检讨，更把自己的错误，推之于客观原因。如说什么“缺乏一定的审稿制度，以致对这样立场和观点都错误的作品，还是无原则地、一团和气地只提出了一些无关宏旨的枝节意见和表面辞句的修饰，竟忽略了根本原则性的错误”。但为什么会缺乏审稿制度呢？就根本没作说明。同时，不仅如此，该检讨还说，他们“在审稿时还多少存在着无原则照顾团结的偏差”。但就以上述所提被批评的各文作者来说，如任美锷、徐近之、刘恩兰等，他们自己就是地理学会的理事和候补理事，也就是“地理学报”的总编辑和编辑。试问，其所谓“无原则照顾团结”，到底“照顾”的是些什么人呢？由此可见，“地理学报”编辑委员会对于自己工作的不负责任，已达到什么程度！
    为什么“地理学报”会产生这样严重的缺点和错误呢？其主要原因首先是“地理学报”一贯忽视政治思想领导工作。虽然在中国科学院成立的开始时，政务院文化教育委员会曾给中国科学院提出十一项“基本任务”，其中特别重要的，就是“确定科学研究为人民服务的观点，与实际密切配合”；“加强研究人员的政治学习，俾能把握马克思列宁主义的观点与方法”。但是，为中国科学院所领导的“地理学报”，正是忽视了这些东西。它既没有刊登任何介绍有关新地理学理论的科学论文，又没有对资产阶级的地理学作任何系统的批判，更没有组织各地地理学工作者进行马克思列宁主义的学习。这样，它又怎能担负起指导地理科学和地理科学工作者的艰巨任务呢？
    其次是“地理学报”编辑委员会对批评和自我批评缺乏正确的认识。批评和自我批评是改进和推动工作最有效的武器。在批评和自我批评中，科学工作者必须具有对错误和缺点的不调和的严肃性，而决不能对错误和缺点采取掩饰、狡辩或逃避。但很可惜，徐近之的“我对于‘国际地理大会历次概品’一文的检讨”，正如孙敬之所指出的，竟包括着这样三个特点：一、“掩盖错误、避重就轻”；二、“坚持错误、进行反攻”；三、“敷衍搪塞、不愿改过”（“地理学报”第十八卷第三、四合期）。同时，“地理学报”对于自己刊登了这样错误的文章，也不作深刻的检讨，而采取了极不老实的态度。这样的做法，显然就是以资产阶级的思想，来对待批评和自我批评。其结果不仅阻碍了自己，并且更阻碍了地理科学的前进。
    再次是“地理学报”第十六卷出版后一年多以来，才有地理学界同人提出对错误文章的批评。这说明在我们很多地理学工作者中，还残留着严重的自由主义和“师徒关系”。他们互相吹嘘，各不触犯。学生往往不敢批评自己的先生。有些人对于出版了的著作，尤其是中国科学院印行的“地理学报”或属于长辈的出版著作，即使发现了错误，也不敢直率地提出批评。当然，这种态度也是极端错误的。斯大林同志曾经指出：“如果我们不去诚恳地直爽地进行自我批评，不去诚恳地公开地纠正自己的错误，我们就堵塞了前进的道路。”只有善于运用批评和自我批评，才能纠正一切错误的倾向，才能拯救科学水平的下降，而促使科学的不断繁荣和发展。
    总之，“地理学报”三年来存在的缺点和错误，是令人难以容忍的。毛主席曾教导我们，“对以前的错误一定要揭发，不讲情面，要以科学的态度来分析批判过去坏的东西，以便使后来的工作慎重些，做得好些，这就是‘惩前毖后’的意思。”因此，希望“地理学报”编辑委员会，足够地估计过去的错误，并在今后的工作中力予克服。同时，建议中国科学院加强对“地理学报”的领导，使“地理学报”成为一个具有高度政治性、思想性和科学性的学术刊物，在伟大的祖国建设事业中，发挥其应有的作用。
