    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st — While clamoring for and deploying to expand the war of aggression against Korea, the American aggressors continued to indiscriminately bomb peaceful towns and villages in North Korea for more than a month from February to mid-March. Peaceful residential areas in Pyongyang, Wonsan, Hamhung, Chongjin, Manpo, Sonchon, Sariwon and other places were once again subjected to brutal bombing and strafing. In order to avoid being severely hit by the Chinese and Korean People's Air Force and to achieve their cowardly aim of massacring large numbers of residents, the American air bandits mostly used late nights or foggy mornings to carry out sneak attacks. The U.S. Air Force barbarously indiscriminately bombed Pyongyang city and the Taedong County area. In February, U.S. aircraft carried out about ten indiscriminate bombings of the urban and suburban areas of Pyongyang, targeting the houses where people lived and defenseless women, children, and the elderly. During their barbaric air raids on peaceful towns and villages in Korea, the U.S. Air Force suffered heavy blows from the vigilant Chinese and Korean air defense forces and the People's Air Force, who were guarding the Korean airspace.

    二月到三月中旬
    美机连续滥炸朝鲜和平城乡
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】美国侵略者在叫嚣和部署扩大侵朝战争的同时，在二月到三月中旬的一个多月中，继续滥炸朝鲜北部和平城乡。平壤、元山、咸兴、清津、满浦、宣川、沙里院等地的和平居民区，再次遭到残暴的轰炸扫射。美国空中强盗为了避免遭受朝中人民空军的痛击并达到其大量屠杀居民的卑怯目的，绝大部分都利用深夜或有雾的早晨进行偷袭。美国空军野蛮地滥炸了平壤市和大同郡地区。二月间，美机对平壤市区和市郊进行了十次左右的滥炸，把人民居住的房屋和手无寸铁的妇孺老幼作为它们轰炸的对象。美国空军在它们对朝鲜和平城乡进行的野蛮空袭中，受到警惕地保卫着朝鲜领空的朝中防空部队和人民空军的沉重打击。
