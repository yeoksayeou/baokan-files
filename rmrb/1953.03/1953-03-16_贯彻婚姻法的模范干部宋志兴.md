    Song Zhixing is the Party Branch Secretary of Yuzhuang Township, Eighth District, Lushan County, Henan Province.
    After the promulgation of the Marriage Law in May 1950, he received instructions from his superiors to publicize and implement the Marriage Law. At that time, the masses had many resistant ideas, believing that the People's Government was good at everything, but the Marriage Law was not good. In particular, they disagreed with freedom of divorce and finding one's own partner. Cadres were afraid of being scolded and dared not boldly publicize it. Some married cadres were afraid that their wives would initiate divorce; unmarried cadres were afraid that the masses would say they were instigating others to divorce so they could find wives for themselves. Song Zhixing's thinking was also incorrect at the time. He thought: gender equality is right, but freedom of divorce is not good; in the past, poor families saved food for many years to exchange for a wife, and to divorce her immediately would be "losing both the person and the wealth"? There were also few women cadres in the township, and if they all divorced and married into other townships, wouldn't the women's work in our township collapse? In this way, Song Zhixing and other cadres reluctantly publicized it for more than half a year. During this period, the buying and selling of marriages in Yuzhuang Township first happened openly, but then as publicity became stricter, it turned into secret transactions. There wasn't a single case of free marriage. No widows remarried. Although abuse of women was less than in the past, it still existed. At meetings, no young women attended, because old men and women were afraid that their daughters-in-law would divorce and that their daughters would fall in love with others, so they wouldn't let them go out. Niu Xiuying, a woman from Dongliuzhuang, was originally a women's team leader and was very active in her work. Later, her mother-in-law always came to replace her at every meeting. When asked, the mother-in-law said, "She 'gave' her team leader position to me!"
    In February 1951, the Eighth District convened a Party Congress. The issue of implementing the Marriage Law was discussed at the meeting. Yang Chenglin, the District Party Secretary, gave a report, requesting everyone to pay attention to the implementation of the Marriage Law and to carry out large-scale publicity and implementation after returning. Otherwise, the Party members there would be responsible if something happened. He also explained in detail the benefits of implementing the Marriage Law. Afterwards, the Party members reported on their own and the township cadres' thinking, and many had feudal ideas, which caused many negative consequences. After criticism, everyone began to realize that the Marriage Law was very beneficial to the people and production.
    After returning from the meeting, Song Zhixing pondered all the way. He cleared his mind and was determined to respond to the Party's call and implement the Marriage Law. That night, he convened a meeting of all Party members in the township, organizing everyone to study and discuss the Marriage Law. After studying for a few days, everyone felt that truly implementing the Marriage Law would be very beneficial. But when it came to implementing it further, some people frowned. They still had the same concerns as before. Song Zhixing said, "We are all Party members, and one of the important obligations of a Party member is to take the lead in implementing the policies and decrees of the People's Government. The Marriage Law was promulgated by Chairman Mao and must be implemented. Some of the masses can't figure it out for a while, but they will understand if we explain it well." Then he put forward the slogan of "three thicks" and "two fasts." The three thicks are: thick skin, not afraid of being rejected, not afraid of being scolded by the masses; thick lips, publicize to people whenever and wherever you see them, not afraid of wearing down your lips; thick soles, go wherever there is something to do. The two fasts are: fast mouth; fast legs. This boosted everyone's courage, and they all said: Okay, we will definitely do it. After the Party members finished studying, they mobilized the Communist Youth League members and non-Party cadres. After patient explanation, everyone's concerns were also dispelled.
    In order to correctly publicize the Marriage Law and solve practical problems, Song Zhixing asked the primary school teacher to read the articles of the Marriage Law to him. At that time, he knew very few characters, but after studying hard for half a month, he memorized the Marriage Law.
    The cadres dared to publicize boldly, but the scope of publicity was too narrow, and the effect was not great. Song Zhixing and other cadres discussed it and mobilized all the publicity tools, including publicity networks, blackboards, loudspeakers, and reading groups, organizing the twisting of Yangko dances, telling of quick rhymes, and writing slogans. In particular, the role of the drama troupe was even greater. Originally, each village in Yuzhuang Township had scattered small drama troupes, but their role was not great; at this time, they were all concentrated in the township and led by the township. The heads of various publicity organizations in each village met at the township government every five days to check what had been publicized, what the shortcomings were, what the advantages were, and to conduct criticism and praise. Based on these situations, Song Zhixing arranged the work for the next five days. When rehearsing the play, Song Zhixing and the then township head Qiao Guangtai poured tea and water for the actors, and stayed up until midnight. There were male and female actors, and Song Zhixing was afraid that the masses would gossip, so he and everyone jointly stipulated three rules: 1. No fighting or brawling; 2. Unite as one; 3. Study patiently. The drama troupe performed six or seven plays, all of which publicized the Marriage Law. Each village built a stage, and the masses were very welcome.
    In the middle of publicizing the Marriage Law, Song Zhixing also encountered some difficulties. Xing Laoya, the wife of Guo Qingshan in Dongliuzhuang, and Pan Xiulian, the wife of Zhang Quan in Laosizhaizhuang, had been abused for many years, and the relationship between husband and wife was not harmonious. After hearing the publicity of the Marriage Law, they filed for divorce. This angered the two families. One day in March or April 1951, a post was pasted on a tree next to the Dongda Road in Penyaozhuang, scolding Song Zhixing by name, saying that he was instigating women to divorce. Song Zhixing was very sad. But on the other hand, he thought: I am a Communist Party member, and I can't stop making revolution after being scolded once. He found Zhang Quan's family and reasoned with Zhang Quan's father. When he couldn't convince him, he used the example of Liu Tianzeng to persuade him. Liu Tianzeng lived in Dongliuzhuang, and his wife was abused by her mother-in-law. Before liberation, she was tortured to the point of committing suicide by jumping into a well. The wife's family refused to give up, and many people came, eating and drinking and making trouble, and ruining Liu's family's eighteen mu of land and houses. Song Zhixing then persuaded Zhang Quan's father, saying that if the daughter-in-law and your son are not in harmony, not to mention that someone will die, just say that she is full of grievances and has no intention to produce, and you will not have a good life either. Slowly, he convinced the other party, and they agreed to the daughter-in-law's divorce from his son. Song Zhixing also used this method to persuade Guo Qingshan's family. Now, Pan Xiulian has found a new partner and married, and Guo Qingshan has also married freely. These two families are now very affectionate when they see Song Zhixing.
    Not long after solving the problems of Zhang Quan and Guo Qingshan's families, another incident occurred in Penyaozhuang. Li Yucheng's eldest daughter was called Yuhua, 25 years old. Her parents arranged a marriage for her when she was young. Yuhua was very aggrieved in her husband's family. After the Marriage Law was issued, she proposed to divorce and ran back to her parents' home. Li Yucheng had feudal ideas. When he heard that his daughter was going to divorce, he was very angry and did not allow his daughter to enter the house; he said that if she entered the house, he would break her legs. After hearing this, Song Zhixing first asked Yuhua to live in his own home, and then went to talk to Yuhua's father. First, he compared the advantages and disadvantages of the new and old marriage systems, and then talked about the actual examples in the township. After talking for six or seven days, Li Yucheng slowly figured it out and let his daughter return home. Last spring, Li Yucheng's second daughter, Yulian, also divorced and came back. This time, Li Yucheng did not block her from entering the house. But not long after, Yulian was about to have a child. According to the old rules, daughters cannot have their confinement period in their parents' home. Her father asked her to remarry and return to her original husband's home. Yulian had no choice but to go to the district government to go through the remarriage formalities. Her husband was young, less than twenty years old, and the district government did not allow it. Song Zhixing was in the district at the time, and he said to Yulian: "It doesn't matter, you go back to your parents' home first, and I will talk to your father." But when he came back to find Li Yucheng to talk, the old man was very stubborn and would not agree no matter what. There was no way, so Song Zhixing said: "During the land reform, Yulian had not yet married, and she was given houses and land; when she married, you did not let her take them away. Now you take out her houses and land and let her have her confinement period in her own house." As a result, Yulian gave birth to a baby girl in her parents' home. After the child was born, Song Zhixing also instructed his wife to visit Li's house frequently to take care of Yulian, so as not to waste the child because no one delivered water and cooked food.
    In the middle of this, Song Zhixing also suffered from the difficulties of his family. His mother was afraid that Song Zhixing would "offend" people outside, and persuaded him not to "meddle in other people's business." Song Zhixing did not listen, so his mother did not make shoes for Song Zhixing - to see if he could walk barefoot? Song Zhixing went barefoot to publicize everywhere.
    Around December of the year before last, free marriages began to appear. One was Guo Qingshan and Hao Xiulian from Dongliuzhuang; the other was Cui Laohei and Gong Xiuhua from Hewan Village. Song Zhixing seized this opportunity and first discussed it within the Party, deciding to publicize it greatly. A stage was set up behind the township government, making it very lively. At the wedding, the newlyweds all spoke and made production plans after their marriage. Song Zhixing also took the opportunity to publicize it, and the masses responded very well, saying that free marriage was very glorious.
    In the winter of the year before last, Lushan County carried out large-scale publicity of the Marriage Law during the democratic movement. Since then, the atmosphere in the whole township has fundamentally changed. The masses all knew the benefits of the Marriage Law. Up to now, there have been 34 couples who have married freely in the township, 14 who have cancelled their marriage (arranged by their parents in the past), 12 who have divorced, and three widows who have remarried. There is a widow in Caojiagou Village who has been widowed for 24 years. In the past, she wanted to remarry, but her family and son did not agree. Last spring, she went to the district government to register her marriage, and her son also agreed. There is now not a single woman in the township who is abused or killed or commits suicide. There is no more beating of women, and there is still scolding of women, but it is individual cases. There are no more marriages arranged by parents, and it is impossible to arrange them even if they want to. Women have a high enthusiasm for production. Those who can participate in production are participating in production, and some have even become model workers. There are 34 female actors in the drama troupe. No matter what kind of meeting is held, women arrive very neatly. Now, Yuzhuang Township is a model township in Lushan County for implementing the Marriage Law, and Song Zhixing is a model cadre in the county for implementing the Marriage Law.

    贯彻婚姻法的模范干部宋志兴
    王青
    宋志兴是河南省鲁山县第八区于庄乡的党支部书记。
    一九五○年五月婚姻法颁布后，他接到上级的指示，让宣传贯彻婚姻法。当时群众有很多抵触思想，认为人民政府甚么都好，就是婚姻法不好。特别是不同意离婚自由和自找对象。干部们怕挨骂，都不敢大胆宣传。已结婚的干部，有的怕自己的媳妇闹离婚；没结婚的干部，怕群众说挑拨别人离婚，自己好找媳妇。宋志兴当时的思想也不对头。他想：男女平等是对，就是离婚自由不好；过去，穷人家积攒多年粮食，才能换个媳妇，一下给离掉，岂不是“人财两空”？乡里妇女干部也少，如果她们都离了婚，嫁到外乡，本乡的妇女工作岂不要垮台？就这样，宋志兴和其他干部勉勉强强地宣传了半年多。这期间，买卖婚姻在于庄乡先是明来明去，后来宣传得紧了，便变成暗地里买卖。自由结婚的一对也没有。寡妇改嫁的也没有。虐待妇女的虽比过去少了，但也还有。开会时，青年妇女一个都不到，因为老头、老婆怕媳妇离婚，怕闺女和人恋爱，不让她们出门。东刘庄的妇女牛秀英，原来是个妇女小组长，工作很积极。后来每次开会，总是婆婆来代替。一问，婆婆说：“她的小组长‘让’给我啦！”
    一九五一年二月，第八区召开了党代表大会。会上谈到贯彻姻婚法的问题。区委书记杨成林作报告，要求大家一定要重视婚姻法的执行，回去要大规模地宣传贯彻。要不，那里出了事那里的党员要负责。并且详细地讲了贯彻婚姻法的好处。以后，党员们汇报了一下自己的和本乡干部的思想情况，都有不少封建思想，并且造成了不少恶果。经过批判，大家开始认识到婚姻法对人民对生产很有好处。
    开会回来，宋志兴捉摸了一路。他打通了思想，下决心要响应党的号召，把婚姻法贯彻下去。当天晚上，他召集了全乡的党员大会，组织大家学习、讨论婚姻法。学习了几天，大家觉得真正实行了婚姻法，好处很大。可是一说到往下贯彻，有些人就皱眉头。他们还是过去那些顾虑。宋志兴说：“咱们都是党员，党员的重要义务之一就是带头执行人民政府的政策法令。婚姻法是毛主席颁布的，一定要执行。有些群众一时想不开，好好给讲讲就会明白的。”接着他提出“三厚”、“两快”的口号。三厚是：脸皮厚，不怕碰钉子，不怕群众骂；嘴唇厚，无论何时何地，见人就宣传，不怕磨薄嘴唇；脚板厚，那里有事到那里。两快是：嘴快；腿快。这样鼓起了大家的勇气，都说：行，一定干。党员学习完了，就又动员青年团员、非党团员干部。经过耐心解释，大家的顾虑也打消了。
    为了正确地宣传婚姻法，并解决实际问题，宋志兴找小学教员给他念婚姻法的条文。当时他识字很少，但用心学了半个月，便把婚姻法背过了。
    干部们敢大胆宣传了，可是宣传面太窄，效果不大。宋志兴便和其他干部商量好，动员起所有的宣传工具，包括宣传网、黑板报、广播筒、读报组，组织扭秧歌、说快板、写标语。特别是剧团的作用更大。原来于庄乡各村都有零散的小剧团，作用不大；这时都集中到乡，由乡领导。各村的各种宣传组织的组长，每五天到乡政府接头一次，检查宣传了些甚么，有甚么缺点，有甚么优点，进行批评和表扬。根据这些情况，宋志兴布置下五天的工作。排戏的时候，宋志兴和当时的乡长乔光泰给演员们烧茶、端水，一熬就是半夜。演员中有男有女，宋志兴怕群众说闲话，就和大家共同规定了三条规矩：一、不打不闹；二、团结一致；三、耐心学习。剧团先后演出六、七个戏，都是宣传婚姻法的。每村都搭了戏台，群众很欢迎。
    在宣传婚姻法中间，宋志兴也碰到些困难。东刘庄郭庆山的媳妇邢老哑和老寺寨庄张圈的媳妇潘秀莲，多年受虐待，夫妇感情不和，听到婚姻法的宣传后，提出离婚。这一下惹恼了两家的人。一九五一年三、四月间的一天，盆窑庄东大路旁的树上贴出一张帖子，指名骂宋志兴，说他挑拨妇女离婚。宋志兴很难过。但反过来一想：自己是共产党员，不能挨一句骂就不干革命了。他找到张圈家，和张圈的爹讲道理。说不服，他便用刘田增的例子来劝说。刘田增住在东刘庄，他媳妇受婆婆虐待，解放前被折磨得跳井自杀了。媳妇的娘家不依，来了很多人，横吃横闹，把刘家十八亩地和房子都折腾完了。宋志兴便劝张圈的爹说，媳妇和你儿子不和，不用说出了人命不得了，就说她满肚子委屈，没心生产，你们也过不好。慢慢地说得对方心转了，同意媳妇和儿子离婚。郭庆山家，宋志兴也是用这种办法说服的。现在，潘秀莲又找到新的对象结了婚，郭庆山也自由结了婚。这两家人现在见了宋志兴很亲热。
    解决了张圈和郭庆山家的问题以后不久，盆窑庄又出了一件事。李玉成的大女儿叫玉花，二十五岁，父母从小给她包办结了婚。玉花在婆家很受气。婚姻法一下达，她提出要离婚，跑回娘家。李玉成有封建思想，听说闺女要离婚，气得不得了，不许闺女进门；说要进门就砸断她的腿。宋志兴听说后，先让玉花住到自己家里，随后就去找玉花的爹讲道理。先对比新旧婚姻制度的好处和坏处，再讲本乡的实际例子，讲了六、七天，李玉成慢慢地想通了，让闺女回了家。去年春天，李玉成的二闺女玉莲也离婚回来了。这次李玉成没把她挡在门外。可是过了不多时，玉莲要生小孩。按老规矩，闺女不能在娘家坐月子。她爹叫她复婚，回原婆家去。玉莲没法，到区政府去办理复婚手续。她男人年纪小，不到二十岁，区政府不准。宋志兴当时正在区上，便对玉莲说：“不要紧，你先回娘家去，我向你爹说去。”但回来找李玉成说时，老头子很固执，怎么也不答应。没办法，宋志兴就说：“土地改革时，玉莲还没出嫁，她分有房子和地；她出嫁时，你没让她带走。现在你拿出她的房子和地来，让她在自己的房子里坐月子。”玉莲结果在娘家生了个女孩子。孩子生出后，宋志兴又嘱咐自己的媳妇，让她勤去李家照顾玉莲，免得没人送水做饭，糟蹋了小孩。
    这中间，宋志兴也受了家里人的难为。娘怕宋志兴在外面“得罪”人，劝他，不让他“多管闲事”。宋志兴不听，娘就不给宋志兴做鞋——看你能光着脚板走道？宋志兴就光着脚到处宣传。
    前年十二月间，自由结婚的开始出现了。一起是东刘庄的郭庆山和郝秀莲；一起是河湾村的崔老黑和龚秀花。宋志兴看准这个机会，先在党内商量，决定大大宣传一下。在乡政府后面搭了个台子，弄得很热闹。结婚时，新婚夫妇都讲了话，订了婚后生产计划。宋志兴也乘机进行宣传，群众反应很好，说自由结婚很光荣。
    前年冬天，鲁山县在民主运动中大规模地宣传了婚姻法，以后，全乡风气从根本上改变了。群众都知道了婚姻法的好处。到现在，全乡自由结婚的已有三十四对，退婚的（过去父母包办的）十四个，离婚的十二个，寡妇改嫁的三个。曹家沟庄有
    一个寡妇，守了二十四年寡，过去想改嫁，本家和儿子都不同意。去年春天，她去区政府登记结婚，儿子也同意了。全乡现在没有一个妇女受虐待或被杀、自杀的。打妇女的没有了，骂妇女的还有，但是个别的。父母包办婚姻的没有了，想包办也包办不成了。妇女生产情绪很高。能参加生产的都参加了生产，有的还当了劳动模范。剧团里有女演员三十四个。不论开甚么会，妇女到得很齐。现在，于庄乡是鲁山县贯彻婚姻法的模范乡，宋志兴是全县的贯彻婚姻法模范干部。
