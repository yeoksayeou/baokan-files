Xinhua News Agency, March 25th: According to the Romanian News Agency, the Romanian people, responding to the call of the Standing Committee for the Defense of Peace of the Romanian People's Republic, held extensive protest activities around March 23rd – “Day of Protest Against US Imperialist Use of Bacteriological Weapons.” Mass protest rallies were held in many cities, villages, factories, schools, and minority areas throughout the country.

In Bucharest, the capital of Romania, the "Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej" factory, the "Docea Cisti Sitri Agasta" factory, the "C. U. Rusci" factory, the "Gevogen" factory, the "Magas Lacosi" factory, and some schools and cultural institutions held protest rallies. At the meeting in the "Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej" factory, Veronica Porumbacu, a national prize winner and female poet, spoke, denouncing the US aggressors for their criminal acts of germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China. Many female workers spoke at the meeting, demanding that germ warfare be stopped. Anna Salescu, the leader of a peace workgroup, said: "The struggle of the Korean people is also our struggle. The crimes of US imperialism in Korea are crimes against all of humanity. In order to defend peace and life, we must fight with all our strength."

Many workers, Stakhanovite workers, scientists, professors, literary workers, as well as mothers and young people, wrote letters to newspapers, expressing their indignation and support for the heroic Korean and Chinese people. Balaschivescu, President of the University of Bucharest and a member of the National Assembly, wrote: We are determined to stop this heinous crime. We protest and struggle together with all peace-loving humanity to stop the bloody claws of American fascism. Mother Hero Dagmilescu wrote: When germ bombs were dropped in Korea, we mothers thousands of miles away worried about the fate of our children. We know that what the US imperialists have prepared for the world is the same as what they have prepared for war-stricken Korea. Therefore, we loudly oppose the use of germ weapons in Korea. Iva Sloboda, a lecturer at the "Cantacuzino" Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, wrote: We are upright bacteriology doctors - young and old, and we should be at the forefront of condemning this crime and actively fighting against it. Germ warfare is the most despicable, dehumanizing and barbaric form of warfare. These criminals will certainly not escape the public trial of the people of the world.

    罗马尼亚人民集会抗议美国细菌战罪行
    【新华社二十五日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社消息：罗马尼亚人民响应罗马尼亚人民共和国保卫和平常设委员会的号召，在三月二十三日——“抗议美帝国主义使用细菌武器日”前后，举行了广泛的抗议活动。全国许多城市、乡村、工厂、学校和少数民族地区都举行了群众性的抗议集会。
    在罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特，“乔治乌—德治”工厂、“道查·齐施·西特里伊·阿加斯特”工厂、“西·乌司·露锡”工厂、“格伏根”工厂、“马加斯·拉科西”工厂等以及一些学校、文化机关都召开了抗议集会。在“乔治乌—德治”工厂的大会上，国家奖金得奖人、女诗人维罗尼卡·坡隆巴库发言，她斥责美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国的东北进行细菌战的罪恶行为。许多女工在会上发言，要求制止细菌战。一位负责和平工作组的组长安娜·莎莱斯库说：“朝鲜人民的斗争也就是我们的斗争。美帝国主义在朝鲜的罪行就是对整个人类犯的罪行。为了保卫和平和生命，我们要拿出全力来战斗。”
    许多工人、斯塔哈诺夫式工作者、科学家、教授、文艺工作者，以及母亲和青年，纷纷写信给报纸，表示他们的愤慨和对英勇的朝中人民的声援。布加勒斯特大学校长、国民议会议员巴拉斯齐维斯库写道：我们坚决地要制止这种滔天罪行，我们与全体渴望和平的人类一起抗议，共同斗争，以制止美国法西斯主义的血爪。母亲英雄达格米莱斯库写道：当细菌弹在朝鲜投下时，我们在千万里以外的母亲们对我们孩子们的命运担心了。我们知道，美帝国主义者为全世界预备着的东西和为遭受战灾的朝鲜预备的一样。因此，我们大声疾呼反对在朝鲜使用细菌武器。“康泰库西诺”流行病学与微生物学学院讲师伊瓦·斯洛柏达写道：我们是正直的细菌学科医师——年青的和年老的，我们应该站在谴责这种罪行的最前列，并且积极地对它进行斗争。细菌战是最卑鄙、最灭绝人性和最野蛮的战争方式。这种罪犯一定逃不脱世界人民的公审。
