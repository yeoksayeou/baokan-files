Our Country Unselfishly Assists Japanese Nationals in China to Return Home
Letter of Thanks from the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

[Xinhua News Agency, March 15th] The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on January 25th, thanking China for its selfless assistance to Japanese nationals residing in China to return to their country. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party replied to the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party in March, stating that the Chinese people would provide all possible assistance to Japanese nationals willing to return to their country, and wishing the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people further success in their struggle for independence, democracy, and peace.

The Letter from the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:

To the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:

We would like to express our deep gratitude to the entire people of your country and your government for assisting Japanese nationals residing in your country to return home and for providing convenience to the seven-member Japanese National Delegation that traveled to your country for this purpose.

The Japanese people will never forget the fact that Japanese imperialists invaded your country for a long time and the serious damage your country suffered. The Japanese people are unanimously cheering the fact that you do not hold grudges about the past and provide multifaceted assistance to Japanese nationals in China to return home.

The Japanese people know that this measure taken by the people and government of your country is entirely based on human love and the standpoint of harmony and friendship between the Chinese and Japanese nations.

As the Japanese delegation departs, we can report that all of Japan is overflowing with gratitude to the Chinese people and their government.

At the same time, the attitude adopted by your country, that is, believing that the Yoshida government of Japan, the running dogs of American imperialism, is not qualified to understand the friendly will of the people and government of your country, therefore ignoring them, directly appealing to the Japanese people, and accepting the representatives of the people, is precisely stirring up profound democratic reflection and discussion.

Although the Japanese Yoshida government reluctantly issued passports to Japanese nationals and representatives, it imposed various restrictions on the return of Japanese nationals in China, disregarded human rights, obstructed the entry of some people, and put forward unfounded figures.

It is the duty of the Japanese people, and even more so the task of the Japanese working class, the peasant class, and mass organizations, especially the responsibility of our party, to strive to eliminate these illegal acts, promote the return of compatriots in China, and give returnees a warm reception.

The intention of the Japanese government in doing so is obviously to violate the good intentions of the people and government of your country, create a state of hostility between the peoples of China and Japan, cut off Sino-Japanese trade, participate in the aggression of American imperialists against Korea and China, and become their running dogs. However, the Japanese people must strive to smash this attempt by the Yoshida government, further strengthen the friendly unity between the peoples of our two countries, infinitely develop Japanese-Chinese trade, and strive to end the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea as soon as possible.

The task of the Japanese working class and its party, the Japanese Communist Party, is to devote the entire party's strength to supporting and realizing this demand of the people.

As the Japanese National Delegation departs, we express our heartfelt gratitude to the entire people and government of the People's Republic of China.

At the same time, we extend fraternal respect to the Communist Party of China, the core of leadership of the People's Republic of China and its people and government.

Your party has offered sincere and affectionate advice to our country from the standpoint of Marxism-Leninism and the brotherly standpoint of international proletarian parties. At the same time, your party has inspired the people of your country, brilliantly smashed the policy and attempt of the Japanese occupiers to expand the Korean War, made great contributions to the cause of liberation, independence and peace of the nations of the Far East, and this time has provided great assistance to Japanese nationals residing in your country to return home.

We, together with the Japanese people, the entire Japanese working class, and the entire peasant class, express our deep gratitude for this.

We express our heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party of China and its great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, who are struggling day and night for world peace, for the immediate cessation of the Korean War of aggression, for the happiness of the people of all countries in the Far East, for the construction of great China, and for the enhancement of friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan.

Long live the unlimited development and happiness of the people of the powerful People's Republic of China!

Long live the Communist Party of China, the leader of the great People's Republic of China under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live the friendly cooperation between the peoples of China and Japan!

Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party

    我国无私地协助在华日侨返回家园
    日共中央指导部函谢中共中央
   【新华社十五日讯】日本共产党中央指导部在一月二十五日写信给中国共产党中央委员会，感谢中国无私地协助居留中国的日侨回国。中国共产党中央委员会在三月间回信日本共产党中央指导部，表示中国人民将给愿意回国的日侨以一切可能的援助，并祝日本共产党和日本人民在争取独立、民主、和平的斗争中，取得进一步的成就。
      日本共产党中央指导部致中国共产党
        中央委员会的信中国共产党中央委员会：
    对于此次协助居留贵国的日侨回国，并对为此而前往贵国的七名日本国民代表团给予便利，谨向贵国全体人民和贵国政府表示深深的谢意。
    日本国民决不会忘记日本帝国主义者长期侵略贵国的行为，以及贵国所蒙受的严重损害的事实。而对于不咎既往，多方面协助在华日侨归国，日本国民一致为之欢呼。
    日本国民知道，贵国人民和政府此种措施完全是从人类爱和中日两民族和睦友好的立场出发的。
    当此日本代表团出发之际，我们可以奉告的是：全日本洋溢着感谢中国人民及其政府的热情。
    与此同时，对于贵国所采取的态度，即认为美帝国主义的走狗——日本吉田政府没有资格来理解贵国人民及贵国政府的友好意志，因此不加理睬，而直接向日本国民呼吁，接受国民的代表，这事正掀起深刻的民主主义的反省与议论。
    日本吉田政府虽然无可奈何地把护照发给日本国民和代表，但对于在华的日侨的回国却予以各种限制，他们藐视人权，妨碍某些人的入境，并且拿出毫无事实根据的数字来。
    努力排除这些不法行为，促进在华同胞的回国，给回国者以温暖的接待，是日本国民的义务，更是日本工人阶级、农民阶级和群众团体的任务，尤其是我党的责任。
    日本政府的这种行为，其意图很明显地是违反贵国人民和政府的好意，造成中日两国人民的敌对状态，断绝日中贸易，参加美帝国主义者对朝鲜和中国的侵略，并成为其走狗。可是，日本国民必定要努力粉碎吉田政府的这种企图，进一步地加强贵我两国人民的友好团结，无限地发展日中贸易，努力早日结束美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争。
    日本工人阶级及其政党——日本共产党的任务，则在于以全党的力量，献身于支援国民的这种要求，并促其实现。
    当此日本国民代表团出发之时，我们对中华人民共和国全体人民及其政府表示衷心的感谢。
    同时，对于中华人民共和国及其人民与政府的领导核心的中国共产党致兄弟的敬意。
    贵党曾以马克思列宁主义的立场、国际无产阶级政党兄弟般的立场，对我国提出诚恳亲切的忠言。同时，贵党鼓舞了贵国人民，出色地粉碎了日本的占领者扩大朝鲜战争的政策及其企图，对远东各民族的解放、独立与和平事业有极大的贡献而此次又对居留在贵国的日本侨民回国予以绝大的援助。
    我们和日本国民、日本全体工人阶级、全体农民阶级一道对此表示深厚的感激。
    对日夜为世界和平、为立即停止朝鲜侵略战争、为远东各国人民的幸福、为伟大的中国的建设和增进中日两国人民友好关系而奋斗的中国共产党及其伟大的领导者——毛泽东同志，表示衷心的感谢。
    强大的中华人民共和国的无限发展与人民的幸福万岁！
    毛泽东同志领导下的伟大的中华人民共和国的领导者——中国共产党万岁！
    中日两国人民友好合作万岁！
                              日本共产党中央指导部
