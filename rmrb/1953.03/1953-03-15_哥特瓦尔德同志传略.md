    Biography of Comrade Gottwald
    Klement Gottwald was born in 1896 and was an outstanding leader of the Czechoslovak workers' movement and a Czechoslovak statesman, the President of the Czechoslovak Republic. From 1929 to 1945, he served as the General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and since 1945 as the Chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. He was born into a small farming family in Moravia; from the age of twelve, he began to live a life of labor.
    Since 1912, Gottwald has been a participant in the youth social democratic movement. After the establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic (1918), Gottwald was an active activist of the left wing of the Social Democratic Party—the core of the Czechoslovak Communist Party founded in 1921. From 1922 to 1925, Gottwald was the editor-in-chief of the Slovak Party's newspaper. From 1926 to 1929, he served as the Minister of Propaganda and Agitation of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party; he led a resolute struggle against opportunists and for the Bolshevikization of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. At the Fifth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party (February 1929), which was a turning point in the history of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Gottwald made a report. In this report, based on the main instructions of Comrade Stalin, he clarified the issues of the relative stability of capitalism, the danger of new wars, and the characteristics of the international and domestic situation in Czechoslovakia. The Marxist-Leninist party core led by Gottwald smashed the opportunists and purged them from the party. Since the Fifth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Gottwald has served as the General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. In 1929, he became a member of the Czechoslovak Parliament.
    After Germany established the Hitler dictatorship (1933) and became the source of war in Europe, the Czechoslovak Communist Party led by Gottwald strengthened the struggle to establish a united front of workers against war and the threat of fascism, and strengthened the struggle for social and national liberation and to defend the freedom and independence of the Czechoslovak Republic. Gottwald actively participated in the work of the Communist International. From 1928 until the dissolution of the Communist International in 1943, he was a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International. From 1935 to 1943, he was the Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Communist International. After the Munich Agreement, the Czechoslovak Communist Party, headed by Gottwald, called on the people to defend the republic, pointing out that guaranteeing Czechoslovakia's national independence and Czechoslovakia's close cooperation with the Soviet Union were inseparable. In 1938, on behalf of J.V. Stalin, Gottwald delivered a notice to Czechoslovak President Beneš, stating that even if France did not provide assistance, the Soviet Union was willing to provide military assistance to Czechoslovakia to protect it from German aggression; at the same time, even if the then landlord Poland or aristocratic Romania refused to allow Soviet troops to pass through, the Soviet Union would provide assistance in accordance with the Soviet-Czechoslovak Mutual Assistance Treaty signed in 1935. The bourgeois rulers of Czechoslovakia preferred to surrender to the Hitlerites and their British and French accomplices who betrayed Czechoslovakia, rather than establishing an alliance with the Soviet Union and defending the country's independence. After Czechoslovakia was betrayed to the Hitlerites, only the Czechoslovak Communist Party, headed by Gottwald, fought for the revival of the Czechoslovak Republic. From 1939 to 1945, Gottwald led the people of all ethnic groups in Czechoslovakia in the struggle against the occupiers and traitors, and led the struggle for independence and fundamental socio-economic reforms. Due to Gottwald's appeal, the Soviet government gave great assistance to the people's anti-fascist Slovak uprising. During the occupation of Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak Communist Party, under the leadership of Gottwald, carried out unremitting struggles to consolidate the friendship between the Czech and Slovak peoples, to promote the unity of all national forces against the occupiers, to seize power and make it serve the interests of the people.
    After the Soviet army liberated eastern Czechoslovakia from Hitler's shackles, Gottwald became the Deputy Prime Minister of the National Front's Czechoslovak government established in Košice on April 4, 1945. In May 1945, after the Soviet army defeated Hitler's Germany and liberated Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak Communist Party, under the leadership of Gottwald, led the people in the struggle to build a people's democratic Czechoslovakia, and led the struggle for Czechoslovakia to develop along the path of socialism. Gottwald led the united government of the Czechoslovak National Front. In February 1948, the Czechoslovak bourgeois reactionaries, lackeys of American and British imperialism, attempted to stage an anti-people coup, the purpose of which was to overthrow the Gottwald government. This was an attempt to destroy the new people's democratic Czechoslovakia, to separate Czechoslovakia from its alliance with the Soviet Union and turn it into an American base for aggression. The Czechoslovak Communist Party, relying first on the strength of the working class, and also on the laboring peasants and progressive intellectuals, led the struggle against the conspirators, calling on the working people to defend the achievements of democracy. The reactionaries' conspiracy to overthrow the people's democratic system was crushed on February 25, 1948. Gottwald organized a new government.
    On May 9, 1948, the third anniversary of the liberation of Prague by the Soviet army, with Gottwald's direct participation, the Czechoslovak Republic formulated and passed a new constitution consolidating the achievements of the people's democratic system at home. On June 14, 1948, Gottwald was elected President of the Republic. One of the most important results of the crushing of the February conspiracy of the imperialists and their Czechoslovak bourgeois lackeys and the constantly growing prestige of the Czechoslovak Communist Party was the elimination of the split in the workers' movement. The Social Democratic Party merged with the Czechoslovak Communist Party (1948) and adopted a Marxist-Leninist program. The Ninth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party (May 1949), conducted under Gottwald's leadership, determined the party's general line in the cause of building socialism. The Czechoslovak Communist Party, under the leadership of Gottwald, cleared out the remnants of hostile and renegade elements and united the working people to fight for peace and socialism.

    哥特瓦尔德同志传略
    克利门特·哥特瓦尔德生于一八九六年，是捷克斯洛伐克工人运动的卓越领导者和捷克斯洛伐克国家活动家，捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统。从一九二九年到一九四五年，任捷克斯洛伐克共产党总书记，自一九四五年起为捷克斯洛伐克共产党主席。他出生于摩拉维亚的一个小农家庭；从十二岁起开始过劳动的生活。
    自一九一二年起，哥特瓦尔德便是青年社会民主运动的参加者。在捷克斯洛伐克共和国成立后（一九一八年），哥特瓦尔德是社会民主党左翼——一九二一年成立的捷克斯洛伐克共产党的核心——的积极活动家。自一九二二年至一九二五年，哥特瓦尔德为斯洛伐克党的机关报的主编。自一九二六年至一九二九年任捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会宣传鼓动部部长；领导进行了反对机会主义分子、争取捷克斯洛伐克共产党布尔什维克化的坚决斗争。在作为捷克斯洛伐克共产党历史上转捩点的捷克斯洛伐克共产党第五次代表大会上（一九二九年二月），哥特瓦尔德做了报告。他在这个报告中依据斯大林同志的主要指示，阐明了关于资本主义的相对稳定、新战争的危险以及捷克斯洛伐克的国际和国内情况的特点等问题。以哥特瓦尔德为领导的马克思列宁的党的核心，粉碎了机会主义分子并把他们清除出党。自捷克斯洛伐克共产党第五次代表大会之后，哥特瓦尔德便任捷克斯洛伐克共产党总书记。一九二九年便任捷克斯洛伐克国会议员。
    德国建立起希特勒独裁（一九三三年）并成为在欧洲发动战争的策源地之后，哥特瓦尔德所领导的捷克斯洛伐克共产党便加强了争取建立反对战争和反对法西斯主义威胁的劳动者统一战线的斗争，加强了争取社会和民族的解放、保卫捷克斯洛伐克共和国自由和独立的斗争。哥特瓦尔德曾积极参加了共产国际的工作。从一九二八年到一九四三年共产国际解散时为止，他一直是共产国际执行委员会的委员。自一九三五年至一九四三年为共产国际执行委员会书记。在慕尼黑协定之后，以哥特瓦尔德为首的捷克斯洛伐克共产党号召人民保卫共和国，他指出保证捷克斯洛伐克的国家独立和捷克斯洛伐克与苏联的密切合作是不可分的。在一九三八年，依照约·维·斯大林的委托，哥特瓦尔德转交给捷克斯洛伐克总统贝奈斯一件通知，说明甚至在法国不援助的情况下，苏联也愿意给捷克斯洛伐克以军事援助，以保卫它不受德国的侵略；同时，即便在当时地主的波兰或者贵族的罗马尼亚拒绝让苏联军队通过的情况下，苏联也要根据一九三五年所签订的苏捷互助条约予以援助。捷克斯洛伐克的资产阶级统治者宁肯投降希特勒分子及其出卖捷克斯洛伐克的英法同谋者，却不愿与苏联建立联盟和保卫国家的独立。在捷克斯洛伐克被出卖给希特勒分子之后，只有以哥特瓦尔德为首的捷克斯洛伐克共产党为复兴捷克斯洛伐克共和国而斗争。在一九三九年至一九四五年，哥特瓦尔德领导了捷克斯洛伐克各族人民反对占领者和卖国贼的斗争，领导了争取独立和实行社会经济根本改革的斗争。由于哥特瓦尔德的呼吁，苏联政府给与了人民反法西斯的斯洛伐克起义以巨大援助。在捷克斯洛伐克被占领期间，捷克斯洛伐克共产党在哥特瓦尔德领导之下，为巩固捷克人民和斯洛伐克人民的友爱、为促使各民族力量的团结一致反对占领者、夺取政权并使之为人民的利益服务而进行了不懈的斗争。
    在苏军由希特勒羁绊下解放了捷克斯洛伐克东部之后，哥特瓦尔德成了一九四五年四月四日在科什采建立起来的民族阵线的捷克斯洛伐克政府的副总理。一九四五年五月，在苏军击溃希特勒德国和解放捷克斯洛伐克以后，捷克斯洛伐克共产党在哥特瓦尔德的领导下，领导了人民争取建设人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克的斗争，领导了争取捷克斯洛伐克向社会主义道路发展的斗争。哥特瓦尔德领导了捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线的联合政府。一九四八年二月，美英帝国主义的走狗捷克斯洛伐克资产阶级反动派曾企图制造反人民的政变，其目的是要推翻哥特瓦尔德政府。这就是企图破坏新的人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克，企图使捷克斯洛伐克脱离与苏联的联盟并变成美国的侵略基地。捷克斯洛伐克共产党首先依靠着工人阶级的力量，也依靠劳动农民和进步知识分子，领导了反对阴谋者的斗争，号召劳动人民保卫民主的成果。反动派为了推翻人民民主制度的阴谋，在一九四八年二月二十五日被粉碎了。哥特瓦尔德组织了新政府。
    一九四八年五月九日，苏军解放布拉格三周年纪念日，在哥特瓦尔德直接参与下，捷克斯洛伐克共和国制订并通过了巩固国内人民民主制度的成果的新宪法。一九四八年六月十四日，哥特瓦尔德被选为共和国的总统。帝国主义分子及其捷克斯洛伐克资产阶级走狗的二月阴谋的粉碎和捷克斯洛伐克共产党的不断增长的威望的最重要结果之一，便是消灭了工人运动中的分裂。社会民主党与捷克斯洛伐克共产党联合起来了（一九四八年），采用了马克思列宁主义的纲领。在哥特瓦尔德领导下所进行的捷克斯洛伐克共产党第九次代表大会（一九四九年五月），确定了党在建设社会主义事业中的总路线。捷克斯洛伐克共产党，在哥特瓦尔德的领导下，清除了敌对的和叛变分子的残余，并把劳动人民团结起来，为争取和平与社会主义而斗争。
