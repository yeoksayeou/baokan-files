    [This Newspaper's Report] A large-scale propaganda and implementation of the Marriage Law campaign is about to unfold across the country. Currently, various regions are actively carrying out various preparatory work, especially cadre training. Regions that have completed preparatory work, such as Tianjin, Hefei, and Chongqing, most counties in Hebei Province, have already begun the Marriage Law propaganda and implementation campaign.

    Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions stipulating March of this year as the "Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Month," various regions have actively carried out preparatory work. After the establishment of the Central Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Committee on January 14th, major administrative regions, provinces, special districts, counties, and cities also successively established Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Committees. In addition to establishing a committee, Tianjin also organized two specialized committees responsible for inspection and propaganda work. Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces also organized propaganda committees. Party, government, women's federation, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations in many places issued instructions or decisions on the Marriage Law implementation campaign. The CPC Hubei Provincial Committee issued two instructions, requiring local party committees to ensure that the campaign is carried out in a planned, organized, and healthy manner. Responsible cadres in many regions made reports on the implementation of the Marriage Law at various meetings.

    In order to create experience for the comprehensive implementation of the Marriage Law campaign, provinces (cities), special districts, and counties across the country have generally conducted key pilot projects. According to incomplete statistics from the Central South region, key pilot projects have been conducted in 1,263 locations throughout the region. The Central Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Committee Office dispatched inspection teams to Shanghai, Jiangning, Wuchang and other places to understand the situation and experience of key pilot projects. Key pilot projects in North China began in early January this year. The North China Marriage Law Investigation and Key Pilot Project Team conducted pilot and investigation work in key villages in Hebei and Shanxi and key streets in Tianjin. The six provinces and five directly administered cities in Northeast China also formed key pilot project teams in January, and went to twenty-five places in rural areas, factories, and streets to carry out work. The key pilot projects in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces in Southwest China were carried out earlier. Yunnan Province carried out pilot projects in Chenggong County as early as August last year. At present, the key pilot projects across the country have ended. The experience of key pilot projects in various places proves that as long as the spirit of the central government's instructions is followed and the policy of propaganda and education is adhered to, the broad masses will dispel various concerns and actively support the Marriage Law. In the past, the masses in Chengyu Township, Zizhong County, Sichuan Province, had many misunderstandings about the Marriage Law, and the phenomenon of beating and abusing women was quite serious. After extensive and in-depth propaganda in the key pilot projects, many families became harmonious and united, and the masses' views on the Marriage Law also changed. They all said: Chairman Mao's Marriage Law is really good, twenty-seven articles, every article is for the people, the Marriage Law is a law of unity and a law of production.

    Training cadres and preparing backbones are prerequisites for launching the Marriage Law implementation campaign. At present, most regions across the country are actively carrying out this work. The Central Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Committee Office dispatched working groups in late February to Shandong, Hebei, Hubei, Taiyuan and other places to study the local cadre training situation. There are several ways to train cadres, including running training courses, training at all levels, and training in conjunction with party consolidation. The Hunan Provincial Women's Federation adopted the method of training classes, and in November last year, it brought together women cadres from counties, districts, and townships to study the Marriage Law and examine the situation in the implementation of the Marriage Law. First-level agencies in Sichuan Province, such as the Women's Federation, the court, and the Department of Civil Affairs, successively held departmental meetings to explain the nature, policy, purpose, and methods of the Marriage Law implementation campaign, which improved the understanding of the cadres attending the meeting, and then they went down to train grassroots cadres separately. Around February 10th, most counties in Shanxi Province separately concentrated county and district cadres for about five days to study and examine the Marriage Law. By the end of February, Hebei Province had basically completed the training of the main village cadres, and in early March, it completed the general training of ordinary village cadres, including party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and activists. According to incomplete statistics from sixty counties, three cities, and the Fengfeng mining area, more than 299,800 people participated in the general training. Judging from the cadre training situation in various places, in the past, many cadres had a one-sided understanding of the Marriage Law, some had strong feudal ideas, and some even directly violated the Marriage Law. After training, the general ideological understanding has been improved, creating favorable conditions for publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law among the masses. However, some regions do not have sufficient understanding of the importance of cadre training and are perfunctory. In Tianjin, Suiyuan, and other places, the initial cadre training work was perfunctory, and retraining has been done.

    The study of the Marriage Law by organ cadres has begun successively in various places. The study of cadres at the central level began in early March. The study of cadres in first-level organs in Suiyuan Province ended on February 13. The South China Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CPC, and the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the CPC all convened meetings of party member cadres of directly affiliated organs to mobilize cadres to study and publicize the Marriage Law.

    Propaganda departments in various places have also made preparations for the Marriage Law implementation campaign. As early as January 19, the Central Ministry of Culture issued instructions to cultural departments in various places, requiring local cultural authorities to supervise and assist theaters, cultural centers, cinemas, projection teams, and other units in their jurisdictions to actively participate in propaganda activities related to the Marriage Law. The People's Publishing House has prepared a large number of propaganda materials on the Marriage Law, and some have already been distributed. Propaganda departments in North China provinces and cities have compiled and printed propaganda materials. Shanxi Province compiled and distributed 800,000 copies of various propaganda booklets in February. East China has decided to print and distribute a large number of materials to publicize the Marriage Law, including 79 types and a total of 4.5 million copies distributed by Xinhua Bookstore, including illustrated Marriage Law, comic strips, ballads, rhythmic story-telling, and scripts. The Northeast People's Publishing House has published more than 24 types of "Marriage Law Propaganda Manuals," totaling more than 600,000 copies. More than 2,000 amateur theater troupes throughout Liaoning Province are rehearsing programs related to the Marriage Law.

    However, during the preparatory stage of the campaign, some leading cadres in some regions did not have sufficient understanding of this campaign, so the preparatory work was poorly done. For example, the office of the Yongqing County Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Committee in Hebei Province originally had six cadres, two of whom have been transferred, two are sick, and the remaining two also work part-time in other departments. The Anci County office still has no one in charge and no office space. At the work report meeting held by the Southwest China Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Committee from February 9th to 10th, it also criticized and corrected the mistakes of some regions that neglected preparatory work.

    After the supplementary instructions of the CPC Central Committee on the work of the Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Month were issued on February 18, it promoted the preparatory work in various places. The Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Central South China Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Committee successively issued instructions, requiring various places to seriously study these instructions, seize the preparatory work, and specifically pointed out that training cadres is the key to carrying out this campaign, and strictly stipulated that the method of class struggle should not be adopted in the campaign. The general response of cadres in various places to the supplementary instructions of the CPC Central Committee is: the supplementary instructions are clearer and more specific on the campaign's policy and tasks, and they stipulate practical and effective methods, greatly increasing work confidence. However, there are still a few departments and a few cadres in various regions who have not grasped the spirit of the supplementary instructions of the CPC Central Committee and have a slack mood. The offices of the Northeast China, Fushun City, and Southwest China Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Committees have all had incidents of cadres being withdrawn from participating in the Marriage Law implementation work, which were all stopped by the Marriage Law Implementation Campaign Committee.

    全国各地积极进行训练干部工作
    准备开展宣传贯彻婚姻法运动
    少数地区忽视准备工作的情形急应纠正
   【本报讯】大规模的宣传贯彻婚姻法运动，即将在全国各地展开。现在各地正积极进行各种准备工作，特别是训练干部的工作。已完成准备工作的地区，如天津、合肥、重庆等市，河北省大部分县，已开始了宣传贯彻婚姻法运动。
    自中共中央和中央人民政府政务院发出关于规定今年三月份为贯彻婚姻法运动月的指示以后，各地即积极进行了准备工作。一月十四日中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会成立以后，各大行政区、省、专区、县、市也相继成立了贯彻婚姻法运动委员会。天津市除成立委员会外，还特别组织了负责检查、宣传工作的两个专门委员会。山西、绥远两省也组织了宣传委员会。许多地方的党、政府、妇联、工会及青年团等组织，发出了关于贯彻婚姻法运动的指示或决定。中共湖北省委曾发出两次指示，要求各地党委必须保证运动有计划地、有组织地、健康地进行。很多地区的负责干部，在各种会议上作了有关贯彻婚姻法的报告。
    为了给全面贯彻婚姻法运动创造经验，全国各省（市）、专区、县普遍进行了重点试验工作。据中南区不完全统计，全区已在一千二百六十三处进行了重点试验工作。中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室曾派出视察组，分赴上海、江宁、武昌等地了解重点试验工作情况与经验。华北各地的重点试验工作从今年一月初开始，华北区贯彻婚姻法调查与重点试验工作队，深入河北、山西重点村及天津市的重点街道进行试验、调查工作。东北六省和五个直属市，也在一月份先后组成重点试验工作组，分赴农村、工厂、街道共二十五个地方进行工作。西南区云南、四川等省重点试验工作进行较早，云南省早在去年八月就以呈贡县为重点进行了试验。目前，全国各地的重点试验工作已经结束。各地重点试验工作的经验证明，只要按照中央指示的精神，坚持宣传教育的方针，广大群众就会解除各种顾虑，积极拥护婚姻法。四川省资中县成渝乡的群众过去对婚姻法有不少误解，打骂虐待妇女的现象相当严重，在重点试验工作中经过广泛深入的宣传之后，许多家庭都变得和睦团结起来，群众对婚姻法的看法也改变了，都说：毛主席的婚姻法真好，二十七条，条条为人民，婚姻法是团结法、生产法。
    训练干部，准备骨干，是开展贯彻婚姻法运动的先决条件。目前全国大部地区正积极进行这一工作。中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室在二月下旬已派出工作组，到山东、河北、湖北、太原等地研究当地训练干部的情况。训练干部有开办训练班、层层训练、结合整党进行训练等方式。湖南省民主妇联采用训练班的方式，在去年十一月间集训各县、区、乡的妇女干部，组织她们学习婚姻法，检查在贯彻执行婚姻法中的情况。四川省一级机关，如妇联、法院、民政厅等，曾先后召开部门会议，在会议上讲解贯彻婚姻法运动的性质、方针、目的和作法，提高了参加会议的干部的认识，然后再由他们下去分别训练基层干部。山西全省大部县份，在二月十日左右，分别集中全县县、区干部，以五天左右时间进行婚姻法的学习和检查。河北省二月底基本完成村主要干部的集训工作，三月上旬完成村一般干部并包括党、团员及积极分子的普训工作。据六十个县、三个市及峰峰矿区的不完全统计，参加普训的即有二十九万九千八百余人。就各地集训干部的情况来看，干部中间过去有不少人对婚姻法的理解是片面的，有些人还有浓厚的封建思想，甚至有直接违反婚姻法的行为。经过训练，一般思想认识都提高一步，为在群众中宣传贯彻婚姻法创造了有利条件。但是，有些地区对训练干部的重要性认识不足，草率从事。天津、绥远等地，因最初训练干部工作草率，已重新作了训练。
    机关干部对婚姻法的学习，各地已先后开始。中央一级机关干部的学习，已自三月初开始。绥远省一级机关干部的学习，在二月十三日已经结束。中共中央华南分局、中共云南省委、中共沈阳市委均曾召开直属机关党员干部大会，动员干部学习、宣传婚姻法。
    各地宣传部门也为贯彻婚姻法运动进行了准备工作。中央文化部早在一月十九日即向各地文化部门发出指示，要求各地文化主管部门督促与协助所属地区的剧团、文化馆、电影院、放映队等单位，积极参加关于婚姻法的宣传活动。人民出版社已准备了大批有关婚姻法的宣传材料，有些已经发行。华北各省、市宣传部门都编印了宣传材料。山西省在二月份编发各种宣传小册子八十万份。华东确定印发大批宣传婚姻法的材料，其中由新华书店发行的即有七十九种计四百五十万册，包括婚姻法图解、连环画、鼓词、快板、剧本等。东北人民出版社已出版“婚姻法宣传手册”等二十四种共六十余万册。辽西全省二千多个业余剧团均在排演有关婚姻法的节目。
    但是，在运动准备工作阶段，也有一部分地区的领导干部对这一运动认识不足，因此准备工作作得很差。如河北省永清县贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室原有六名干部，二人已被调走，二人生病，剩下的二人还兼作部门工作。安次县办公室至今尚无专人负责，也没有办公地点。西南区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会在二月九日到十日召开的汇报工作会议上，也批评纠正了某些地区忽视准备工作的错误。
    二月十八日，中共中央关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示发出后，对各地的准备工作起了推动的作用。中共中央中南局、中南区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会先后发出指示，要求各地认真学习这一指示，抓紧准备工作，并特别提出训练干部是开展这一运动的关键，并且严格规定在运动中不得采用阶级斗争的方式。各地干部对中共中央补充指示的普遍反应是：补充指示对运动的方针、任务，指示得更明确、更具体了，并且规定了切实有效的作法，工作信心大为提高。但各地区都有少数部门和少数干部尚未领会中共中央补充指示的精神，而有松劲情绪。东北区、抚顺市、西南区贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室都曾发生抽走参加贯彻婚姻法工作干部的事情，均经贯彻婚姻法运动委员会制止。
