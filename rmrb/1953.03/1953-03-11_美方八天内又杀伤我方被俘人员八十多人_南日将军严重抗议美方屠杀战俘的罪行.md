Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 10th: The U.S. side has once again carried out a large-scale massacre of our captured personnel. According to the U.S. side's announcement, from March 4th to 7th, within four days, the U.S. side killed or wounded as many as seventy prisoners of war.

On March 7th, the U.S. side, using the pretext of a prisoner of war "riot," carried out a bloody massacre of our captured personnel on Longcao Island, killing twenty-three prisoners of war and wounding forty-two. However, even the U.S. side's communiqué could not but admit that the so-called prisoner of war "riot" was actually caused by the U.S. side first injuring a prisoner of war for ulterior motives and attacking the prisoners of war with chemical weapons. When the prisoners of war protested by shouting slogans and singing songs, the barbaric U.S. soldiers frantically massacred the unarmed prisoners of war.

Two days earlier, on March 5th, the U.S. side also killed a prisoner of war on Bongam Island under the pretext of prisoners of war "singing."

On March 4th, two other prisoners of war were wounded on Bongam Island.

On the same day, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers on Jeju Island was murdered by the U.S. side.

On March 6th, a prisoner of war was also murdered by the U.S. side on Geoje Island.

From February 28th to March 7th, incidents of killing and wounding prisoners of war occurred every day in the U.S. prisoner of war camps, and the scale of the incidents became larger and larger. According to the materials disclosed by the U.S. side itself, in these short eight days, as many as eighty-five prisoners of war were killed or wounded by the U.S. side. People here pointed out that this series of atrocities shows that in order to realize the conspiracy of expanding the Rhee Syngman puppet army, the U.S. side has intensified its activities of forcing prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder in their prisoner of war camps. The Rhee Syngman gang admitted on February 24th that they were forcing prisoners of war to sign so-called "petitions" with their own blood, stubbornly "demanding" that the prisoners of war participate in "combat against the Communist army." They also openly revealed that they would forcibly detain at least 40,000 prisoners of war. American columnist Pearson also revealed in the February 5th "Washington Post" that an action on the U.S.'s "Far East military timetable" was to "transfer Chinese prisoners of war from Korea to Taiwan." However, no matter what cruel means the U.S. side adopts, they will obviously not be able to subdue our captured personnel who resolutely demand repatriation to their motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 8th: From February 28th to March 4th, the U.S. side continuously murdered our captured personnel for five days. General Nam Il, chief representative of our delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations, lodged a serious protest to the other side on March 7th. The full text of the protest is as follows: Lieutenant General Harrison, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

From February 28th to March 4th, for five days, your side has continuously murdered our captured personnel in the prisoner of war camps on Geoje Island, Bongam Island, Longcao Island, and Jeju Island. According to your side's public reports alone, eighteen of our captured personnel were killed or wounded. On February 28th, your side killed one of our captured personnel in the Geoje Island prisoner of war camp; on March 1st, your side killed three and wounded eight of our captured personnel in the Geoje Island prisoner of war camp; on March 2nd, your side seriously injured two of our captured personnel in the Geoje Island and Bongam Island prisoner of war camps; on March 3rd, your side seriously injured one of our captured personnel in the Longcao Island prisoner of war camp; on March 4th, your side seriously injured two of our captured personnel in the Bongam Island prisoner of war camp and killed one of our captured personnel in the Jeju Island prisoner of war camp. I lodge a serious protest to your side against this series of new bloody atrocities. Your side cannot escape the serious responsibility for this series of war crimes.

### 美方八天内又杀伤我方被俘人员八十多人  南日将军严重抗议美方屠杀战俘的罪行

    美方八天内又杀伤我方被俘人员八十多人
    南日将军严重抗议美方屠杀战俘的罪行
   【新华社开城十日电】美方又对我方被俘人员进行大规模的屠杀。据美方宣布，从三月四日到七日四天之内，美方又打死打伤战俘达七十人之多。
    三月七日，美方以战俘“暴动”为藉口，对龙草岛上的我方被俘人员进行血腥屠杀，打死战俘二十三人，打伤四十二人。可是连美方的公报也不能不承认，所谓战俘“暴动”，实际上是美方首先为了不可告人的原因打伤了一名战俘，并且用化学武器向战俘进攻。当战俘们用喊口号和唱歌来表示抗议的时候，野蛮的美方士兵就对赤手空拳的战俘疯狂地进行了屠杀。
    在这以前两天，三月五日，美方在蜂岩岛上也以战俘“唱歌”为藉口打死战俘一名。
    三月四日，蜂岩岛上另有两名战俘被打伤。
    同一天，在济州岛上有一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员被美方谋害。
    三月六日，在巨济岛上也有一名战俘被美方谋害。
    从二月二十八日到三月七日，在美方战俘营中每天都发生打死打伤战俘的事件，而且事件的规模越来越大。仅仅根据美方自己透露的材料，在这短短的八天之内，被美方打死打伤的战俘已达八十五人之多。此间人士指出，这一连串的暴行表明：美方为了实现扩充李承晚伪军的阴谋，已经在他们的战俘营中更加紧了强迫战俘充当炮灰的活动。李承晚匪帮在二月二十四日承认他们正在强迫战俘在所谓
    “请愿书”上用自己的血签名，硬要战俘“要求”参加“对共军作战”。他们还公然透露他们至少还要强迫扣留四万名战俘。美国专栏作家皮尔逊在二月五日“华盛顿邮报”上也透露，在美国的“远东军事时间表”上的一项行动，就是“把中国战俘从朝鲜转移到台湾去”。但是，无论美方采取任何残暴的手段，他们显然无法使坚决要求遣返祖国的我方被俘人员屈服。
    【新华社开城八日电】二月二十八日至三月四日五天中，美方连续不断地杀害我方被俘人员。朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日将军于三月七日向对方提出严重抗议，抗议全文如下：联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊中将：
    二月二十八日至三月四日五天中，你方连续不断地在巨济岛、蜂岩岛、龙草岛和济州岛战俘营杀害我方被俘人员，仅据你方公开报道即有我方被俘人员十八人被打死打伤。二月二十八日你方在巨济岛战俘营害死我方被俘人员一人；三月一日你方又在巨济岛战俘营打死我方被俘人员三人，打伤八人；三月二日你方在巨济岛和蜂岩岛战俘营重伤我方被俘人员二人；三月三日你方在龙草岛战俘营重伤我方被俘人员一人；三月四日你方又在蜂岩岛战俘营重伤我方被俘人员二人，在济州岛战俘营害死我方被俘人员一人。对你方这一系列新的血腥暴行，我向你提出严重抗议。你方决不能逃脱这一系列战争罪行的严重责任。
            朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团
                            首席代表南日将军
                            一九五三年三月七日
