According to a letter from reader Ding Baoshan: In the agricultural tax collection work of 1952 in Jinlou Village, Jinqiao Township, Suining County, Jiangsu Province, the policy of calculating taxes according to the rate and legally reducing or exempting taxes was not implemented. Coupled with the coercive commands of cadres, it led to the forced suicide of farmer Jin Zefen in the village. The party and government leading organs of Suining County did not handle this incident properly, and it is suggested that it be re-addressed.

Jin Zefen was 48 years old, of middle peasant status, with a family of six, cultivating 26.97 mu of land. According to the local average annual yield, he should have paid 447 jin of public grain for the whole year. According to the reduction and exemption measures, Jin Zefen should have been exempted from 196.5 jin due to poor harvest and financial difficulties. He had already prepaid 161.5 jin in the summer, and should only have paid 89 jin in the autumn.

Because Suining County did not implement the policy of "legal reduction and exemption" in the autumn tax reduction and exemption work, but instead adopted the method of "contracting for reduction and exemption." The amount of agricultural tax reduction was subjectively allocated from top to bottom to districts, townships, and even villages and administrative groups. After receiving the allocated grain reduction quota, Jinlou Village immediately adopted the method of mass self-reporting and public discussion to carry out the reduction and exemption. During the evaluation and reduction, Sun Ji'an, a cadre of the District People's Government, personally took charge and held meetings for five consecutive nights. Jin Zefen was forced to report eight times. The first time he reported 20 jin, which was not enough, so he increased it. He was evaluated and increased repeatedly, until the eighth time when it increased to 195 jin.

In the process of Jin Zefen's eight self-reports, he was continuously subjected to attacks by district and village cadres. District and village cadres considered him a "stubborn head." At the evaluation meeting on the third night, district cadre Sun Ji'an, deputy village chief Jin Chuanzhen, and others announced: "Tonight, each group will have a militiaman with a gun, specializing in splitting stubborn heads." Some cadres also said that Jin Zefen "is a coward for not paying grain even though he has it." When the meeting was held on the fifth night, Jin Zefen asked Bao Shucong, secretary of the Jinqiao Township branch of the Communist Party of China, to appropriately reduce or exempt him, but Bao scolded him as "consistently engaging in speculation and taking advantage, and wholeheartedly pushing a black cart (meaning to make trouble)." Other cadres and militiamen also attacked him in droves. When some peasants expressed their opposition, Bao scolded the masses as "attacking activists."

Due to improper reduction and exemption, difficulty in paying, and repeated attacks by cadres, Jin Zefen committed suicide. After Jin Zefen committed suicide, Bao Shucong, in order to escape responsibility, even convened an enlarged cadre meeting to arrange: "No indiscriminate talk is allowed, and it cannot be said that he died because of grain collection."

Jin Zefen was not only attacked by cadres during the autumn tax collection, but also during the summer tax collection. During the summer tax collection, Jin Zefen requested a reduction or deferral of tax, and Deputy Village Chief Jin Chuanzhen said that he "was afraid of the Three-Anti campaign and transported the grain away." Because the village cadres were selfish and reduced their own taxes more, Jin Zefen asked to compare with them. Bao Shucong scolded him and said: "What qualifications do you have to compare with the village cadres? You have always engaged in speculation and took advantage, transported the grain away, and still want a reduction or exemption."

Bao Shucong, secretary of the Jinqiao Township branch of the Communist Party of China, has consistently engaged in coercive commands and suppressed criticism. During the summer grain collection in 1952, he locked the peasant masses in the school and led village cadres to search for grain in the peasants' homes. When the masses expressed dissatisfaction, he held a mass meeting and said: "Searching for grain is correct, and can prevent speculation and taking advantage," and threatened the peasants who raised opinions, saying that they were "spreading rumors" and "affecting the summer tax collection, and they would be held responsible." At the autumn tax collection evaluation meeting, peasant Hu Lengyin wanted to reduce a little more grain, and Bao immediately ordered the militiamen to "keep an eye on him."

After Jin Zefen committed suicide, the Suining County People's Government and the Suining County Committee of the Communist Party of China handled the personnel involved in this incident: Bao Shucong was punished with "removal from his post within the Party," but Bao Shucong went to another township to become the township head. Jin Chuanzhen, the deputy village chief of Jinlou Village, was dismissed and sentenced to one and a half years of imprisonment by the People's Court. District cadre Sun Ji'an was given a warning.

Bao Shucong consistently engaged in coercive commands and suppressed criticism, and was directly responsible for Jin Zefen's suicide. He was only punished with removal from his post within the Party, but became a township head again, which is improper handling. Jin Chuanzhen, the deputy village chief of Jinlou Village, should bear certain responsibility for this incident, but he was sentenced to one and a half years of imprisonment, which is heavier than Bao Shucong. Both should be re-addressed. In addition, the Suining County People's Government did not implement the central government's policy of "calculating taxes according to the rate and legally reducing or exempting taxes," subjectively allocated reduction and exemption figures, and mistakenly adopted the method of "contracting tasks," which is also wrong. It is hoped that the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government will conduct an inspection and correction together, and make appropriate handling.

    江苏省睢宁县党政领导机关
    对金泽芬在征粮中被迫自杀事件处理不当
    希望江苏省人民政府进行检查重作处理
    据读者丁宝山来信：江苏省睢宁县金桥乡金楼村，在一九五二年农业税征收工作中，由于没有执行依率计征、依法减免的政策，加以干部强迫命令，致发生该村农民金泽芬被迫自杀事件。睢宁县党政领导机关对这一事件的处理不够妥当，建议重新处理。
    金泽芬年四十八岁，中农成份，全家六口人，种地二十六点九七亩，按当地常年产量，全年应缴公粮四百四十七斤，按照减免办法，金泽芬因粮食歉收及生活困难应减征一百九十六点五斤，他夏季已预交一百六十一点五斤，秋季只应缴八十九斤。
    由于睢宁县秋征减免工作并没有执行“依法减免”的方针，而是采取“减免包干”的办法。把减征农业税的数字主观地、自上而下地分配到区、乡，甚至分配到村和行政小组。金楼村接到所分配的减免粮额后，即采取群众自报公议的办法，进行减免。在评议减免时，区人民政府的干部孙继安亲自掌握，连续开了五个晚上的会，金泽芬被迫自报八次，第一次自报二十斤不行，又增加，屡评屡增，直到第八次增至一百九十五斤。
    在金泽芬八次自报过程中，连续地遭到区、村干部的打击，区村干部认为他是“疙瘩头”，在第三个晚上的评议会上，区干部孙继安、副村长金传真等宣布：“今晚每组一个民兵一枝枪，专劈疙瘩头”。还有的干部说金泽芬“有粮不缴是孬种”。第五个晚上开会时，金泽芬向中共金桥乡支部书记鲍书聪要求适当减免，鲍斥骂他为“一贯投机取巧，一心推黑车子（即捣乱的意思）”。其余干部及民兵也群起攻讦，当若干农民表示反对时，鲍则斥责群众为“打击积极分子”。
    由于减免不当，交纳困难，而且屡遭干部打击，金泽芬就自杀了。金泽芬自杀以后，鲍书聪为了逃避责任，竟又召开扩大干部会议布置：“不许乱讲，不能说他因征粮而死”。
    金泽芬不仅在秋征中遭到干部打击，在夏征中也曾受过打击，夏征时金泽芬要求减征或缓征，副村长金传真说他“惧怕三反，把粮运走”。由于村干部自私自利，自己多减，金泽芬提出和他们比较，鲍书聪斥责说：“你有什么资格和村干部比较，你一贯投机取巧，把粮运走，还要减免”。
    中共睢宁县金桥乡支部书记鲍书聪强迫命令、压制批评的行为是一贯的。在一九五二年夏征公粮时，曾将农民群众锁在学校里，却带领乡村干部到农民家里翻搜粮食，群众表示不满，他即召开群众大会说：“翻粮是正确的，可以防止投机取巧”，并威胁提意见的农民，说他们“胡造谣言”，“影响夏征，要他们负责”。秋征评议会上，农民胡冷银因为要多减一点粮食，鲍即喝令民兵“把他看起来”。
    金泽芬自杀后，睢宁县人民政府和中共睢宁县委员会对这一事件的有关人员作了处理：对鲍书聪的处分是“撤销党内职务”，但鲍书聪却到另一个乡当了乡长，金楼村副村长金传真被撤职并送人民法院判处有期徒刑一年半，区干部孙继安则受到警告处分。
    鲍书聪一贯强迫命令，压制批评，对金泽芬自杀负有直接责任，仅受到撤销党内职务的处分，却又当了乡长，这是处理不当的。金楼村副村长金传真对于这一事件应负一定责任，但被判处一年半徒刑，比起鲍书聪来是重了。都应该重新处理。另外，睢宁县人民政府没有执行中央“依率计征、依法减免”的方针，主观地分配减免数字，错误地采取“任务包干”的办法，这也是不对的。希望江苏省人民政府一并加以检查纠正，并作适当处理。
