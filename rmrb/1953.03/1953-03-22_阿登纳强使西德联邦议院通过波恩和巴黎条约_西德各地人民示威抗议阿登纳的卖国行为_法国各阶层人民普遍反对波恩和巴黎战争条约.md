Xinhua News Agency, March 21st dispatch from Bonn: The West German puppet "Chancellor" Adenauer, on March 19th, submitted the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" agreement, which sell out German national sovereignty, to the West German Federal Assembly for a third reading vote.

Since Adenauer's government barely managed to get these two treaties through the second reading in the Federal Assembly in early December last year, it had to temporarily postpone the third reading procedure due to the increasingly strong opposition from the people of all Germany. However, Adenauer, under the strict supervision of the United States, tried his best to pass these two treaties before his visit to the United States in early April in order to give an account to his American masters. After painstaking behind-the-scenes activities, Adenauer forcibly passed the Bonn and Paris Treaties during the third reading held by the Federal Assembly on the 19th.

When the West German Federal Assembly passed the above-mentioned treaties, it also decided not to accept the "Additional Protocol" to the "European Defense Community" agreement proposed by France. According to Agence France-Presse, Bonn political figures pointed out that the Bonn parliament's action "does not necessarily ease the attitude of other signatory countries towards the decisions currently facing them." On the same day that the Bonn Federal Assembly passed these two treaties, French Prime Minister Mayer reiterated in a speech in Paris that the "European Defense Community" agreement must have an "Additional Protocol."

Xinhua News Agency, March 21st dispatch from Bonn: On the day of the third reading of the Bonn and Paris war treaties by the Bonn Federal Assembly on the 19th, a demonstration with more than 3,000 people was held in Bonn to oppose the ratification of these two traitorous treaties. Many workers from industrial cities in the Ruhr area and other regions also made a special trip to participate. The demonstrators shouted slogans in the streets: "Down with Adenauer!" "We don't want war!" The marching队伍 was large and formed a protest march, heading towards the location of the Bonn Parliament.

The Adenauer traitorous government, fearing popular resistance, took so-called "special preventive measures" in advance, transferring thousands of police from other places to strengthen security. The West German Parliament and the puppet government's location were specially isolated with barbed wire, and a large number of police were deployed around them. When the marching队伍 approached the vicinity of the Parliament Building, the Bonn police used batons, water cannons, and special "mobile water cannons" to carry out barbaric attacks on the demonstrators. Many people who participated in the demonstration were injured, and some people were unreasonably arrested.

According to the German News Agency, throughout West Germany, peace-loving people everywhere held demonstrations to express their firm protest against the Bonn and Paris war treaties that sell out the interests of the German people.

Xinhua News Agency, March 21st dispatch from Paris: People from all walks of life in France universally oppose the Bonn and Paris war treaties.

The National Committee of the French Farmers' Defense of Peace and Agriculture Executive Bureau wrote to all members of parliament, opposing the Bonn and Paris treaties that infringe upon national sovereignty. Many students also wrote similar letters to members of the National Assembly. The Peace Committee of the Audition district of Paris sent a delegation to meet with the Popular Republican Party member Kayou, requesting Kayou and other members of the Popular Republican Party to vote against these two war treaties. Employees of the French Ministry of Finance also sent a delegation to deliver their resolution to the members of the National Assembly Finance Committee, which condemned the Bonn and Paris treaties for "reviving the Hitler Wehrmacht and reviving Hitlerism."

French democratic organizations have issued thousands of letters and petitions opposing these two treaties.

Many local municipal councils oppose the ratification of the Bonn and Paris treaties. The members of these municipal councils include Communists, Socialists, Popular Republicans, and people from other parties and factions.

The National Committee for the Defense of France and the Unity of the French Federation, composed of Independent Republican Party member Pierre André and about a hundred members of various right-wing parties, also issued a statement on the 17th, saying, "No manufacturer in France can escape the economic consequences caused by the 'European Defense Community' agreement." The statement pointed out: This agreement pits the various industries of the countries against each other in competition, and authorizes a supra-national supreme body to formulate military plans, place orders with manufacturers who offer the lowest prices, stipulate import and export volumes, and require enterprises to provide all the information it deems necessary.

Former French Prime Minister and Radical Socialist Party leader Daladier recently said in an interview with a publication in the British-occupied sector of Berlin that whoever carefully reads the "General Treaty" "will find that every word in it is filled with the smell of war." He said: "The majority of the French people oppose these two treaties, and they especially oppose the rearmament of Germany."

    阿登纳强使西德联邦议院通过波恩和巴黎条约
    西德各地人民示威抗议阿登纳的卖国行为
    法国各阶层人民普遍反对波恩和巴黎战争条约
    【新华社二十一日讯】波恩消息：三月十九日，西德傀儡“总理”阿登纳，把出卖德国民族主权的“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团”协定，提交西德联邦议院进行三读表决。
    阿登纳政府自从去年十二月初勉强使联邦议院二读通过这两项条约以后，由于全德人民日益强烈的反对，不得不把三读的程序暂时搁置。但是，受到美国严厉监督的阿登纳，为了便于在四月上旬访美时向美国主子交账，竭力设法在他行前通过这两项条约。经过煞费心机的幕后活动，阿登纳在十九日联邦议院举行三读时，强行通过了波恩与巴黎条约。
    西德联邦议院在通过上述条约时，同时决定不接受法国所提出的关于“欧洲防务集团”协定的“附加议定书”。据法新社报道，波恩政界人士指出，波恩议会的行动“并不见得会缓和其他签字国对于目前所面临的决定的态度”。就在波恩联邦议院通过这两项条约的同一天，法国总理迈耶在巴黎发表的谈话中再次坚持“欧洲防务集团”协定必须要有“附加议定书”。
     【新华社二十一日讯】波恩消息：在十九日波恩联邦议院三读波恩和巴黎战争条约的这一天，波恩举行了有三千多人参加的示威游行，反对批准这两项卖国条约。鲁尔区工业城市和其他地区的许多工人群众也特地赶来参加。示威群众在街上游行时高呼：“打倒阿登纳！”“我们不要战争！”游行的队伍声势浩大，形成了抗议大进军，向波恩议会所在地进发。
    害怕人民反抗的阿登纳卖国政府，在事前就采取了所谓“特别预防措施”，从外地调来数千名警察加强戒备。西德议会及傀儡政府所在地特别用铁丝网隔离起来，并且在周围布置了大批警察。当游行队伍走近议会大厦附近时，波恩警察就用警棍、水龙和特别的“机动水炮”，对示威群众实行野蛮的攻击。许多参加示威的人受伤，一些人被无理逮捕。
    据德意志通讯社报道，在西德各地，爱好和平的人民到处都举行示威，表示坚决抗议出卖德国人民利益的波恩和巴黎战争条约。 【新华社二十一日讯】巴黎消息：法国各阶层人民普遍反对波恩和巴黎战争条约。
    法国农民保卫和平与农业全国委员会执行局写信给全体议员，反对侵犯国家主权的波恩和巴黎条约。许多学生也写了同样的信给国民议会议员。巴黎奥迪松区和平委员会派了一个代表团去见人民共和党议员凯伊欧，要求凯伊欧和人民共和党其他议员投票反对这两个战争条约。法国政府财政部的雇员也派了一个代表团把他们的决议交给国民议会财政委员会委员，这个决议谴责波恩和巴黎条约要“复活希特勒国防军，复活希特勒主义”。
    法国各民主组织发出了好几千封信和请愿书，反对这两个条约。
    许多地方的市政委员会都反对批准波恩和巴黎条约，这些市政委员会的委员有共产党人、社会党人，人民共和党人及其他各党各派人士。
    由独立共和党议员皮埃尔·安德烈及各右翼政党的百来个议员组成的保卫法国和法兰西联邦统一全国委员会，十七日也发表文告说，“法国没有一个制造商能够逃脱‘欧洲防务集团’协定所引起的经济后果。”文告指出：这个协定使各国的各种工业展开竞争，并且授权超国家的最高机构去拟订整军计划，向要价最低的制造商定货，规定进出口量，并且向各企业要求提供它认为必要的一切情报。
    法国前总理和激进社会党领袖达拉第最近对柏林英占区的一家刊物发表谈话时也说：谁要是仔细读一读“一般性条约”，“就能发现其中的每一句话都充满了战争气味”。他说：“大多数法国人民都反对这两个条约，他们特别反对重新武装德国。”
