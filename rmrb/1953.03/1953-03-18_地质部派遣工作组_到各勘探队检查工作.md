    Ministry of Geology Dispatches Work Teams
    to Inspect Work at Various Exploration Teams
    The Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government has dispatched work teams to various exploration teams to inspect their work. The Central Ministry of Geology is a newly established organization, and geological exploration work is distributed in extremely vast and remote areas. In addition, the leadership of the Ministry of Geology did not closely supervise inspections for a period of time in the past. Therefore, there was no in-depth understanding of whether the resource exploration plans of the teams for 1953 were realistic and what problems were encountered in their implementation. On the other hand, most exploration teams were enthusiastic but lacked work experience, and their plans were not thorough, leading to repeated accidents and delays in the start of work. The Central Ministry of Geology studied the above situation and believed that sending inspection teams deep into the grassroots level to help lower-level units solve problems and overcome bureaucratic practices in leadership was the key to ensuring the completion of the 1953 national resource exploration plan. Therefore, it transferred more than 60 cadres to form seven inspection teams. In addition to one team going to Beijing and Changchun Geological College to inspect the teaching work team, and two teams going to the directly subordinate 241st and 641st teams to focus on inspecting drilling and tunneling work, four teams went to four exploration teams in the Southwest and Central South regions to inspect and revise exploration designs and drilling projects.

    地质部派遣工作组
    到各勘探队检查工作
    中央人民政府地质部已派遣工作组赴各勘探队检查工作。中央地质部是一个成立不久的机构，地质勘探工作又分布于极其广阔和偏僻的地带，再加过去一段时期地质部领导上没有抓紧检查，因此，对一九五三年各队的资源勘探计划是否切合实际，执行中有什么问题，都没有深入了解。另一方面，大部分勘探队热情虽高，但缺乏工作经验，计划不周，连续发生事故，开工日期一再延迟。中央地质部研究了以上情况，认为派遣检查组深入下层，帮助下级解决问题，克服领导上的官僚主义，是保证完成一九五三年国家资源勘探计划的关键，于是便抽调了六十多名干部组成七个检查组，除一个组去北京与长春地质学院检查教学工作组，两个组分头至直属二四一、六四一队重点检查钻探、洞探工作外，四个组分赴西南和中南的四个勘探队检查与修正勘探设计及钻探工程。    　（张华）
