Reader Tian Ming wrote a letter exposing that Qu Zhendong, Wang Xiansheng, and Wang Zhiyi, the deputy directors of the Nanchang Automobile Repair Factory of the Jiangxi Provincial Transportation Bureau, have a serious bureaucratic style. Although they were exposed by the Jiangxi Workers' Daily (November 29, 1952) and the Central South Workers' Daily (January 20, 1953), the factory leadership has not humbly examined themselves in the past two months. On the contrary, they have vented their anger on the workers who raised opinions. Initially, they investigated, and then they retaliated. They attempted to transfer the workers who raised opinions to "study" or transfer them away in order to stifle criticism.

The "thug" in the Nanchang Automobile Repair Factory who suppresses criticism is Rao Jixun, the factory's most trusted foreman. Before liberation, Rao was the top disciple of the deputy commander of the puppet 15th Gendarmerie Regiment and the person in charge of manipulating the secret signals (i.e., the words "fast," "slow," and "quiet") on automobiles for the puppet Highway Bureau's Second Transportation Office. He demanded that each driver give him five silver dollars and five gallons of gasoline every month as his special expenses. He also sheltered and bailed out Zhou Xicheng, the commander of a special agent squad (who was sentenced to 15 years in prison and died in prison), three times. Although the factory has undergone democratic reform, it has not been thorough. Therefore, bad elements like Rao Jixun are still riding on the heads of the workers and acting recklessly.

After the Jiangxi Workers' Daily criticized the factory, the bad element Rao Jixun, in order to please the leadership, collected all the newspapers that were sent and did not allow the workers to read them. He also openly asked the production team leaders under his command to investigate the workers who reflected the situation. Deputy Director Wang Zhiyi also questioned the workers at any time: "Did you do this?"

In order to crack down on the workers who reflected the situation, Deputy Director Qu Zhendong publicly said at the meeting for the establishment of the workers' self-defense corps: "Many workers in our factory have opinions but do not raise them face to face (in fact, they are not listened to when they are raised, but instead are labeled, retaliated against, and attacked), but they reflect them randomly. Now that we have organized a self-defense corps, let's see if they dare to do this again!" Wu Boxi, the vice chairman of the trade union, not only did not publicize the significance of establishing a workers' self-defense corps, but also followed the factory director's intentions and said: "Many workers in our factory raise opinions on administrative matters today and opinions on the trade union tomorrow. Now that we have organized a self-defense corps, if they do this again in the future, we will lock them up!" This has made the whole factory panic.

The administrative and trade union leaders of the factory, on the one hand, used the organization of a self-defense corps to intimidate the workers and forbid them from reporting the situation to the newspaper, and on the other hand, used covert methods such as lowering wages and transferring jobs to retaliate. A prominent example is that those who have a good relationship with Rao Jixun are paid high wages. For example, Huang Yaoqing is Rao's fellow apprentice and one of the "Thirteen Taibaos." According to his own report, he has had three accidents and overturned his car, but his salary is ranked as the highest level—level five. On the contrary, Xie Zhipeng, who saved the most gasoline and achieved the most kilometers and safety first in 1951, and who created a single-person operation method for charcoal vehicles in 1952 (see the Beijing Workers' Daily on January 22 this year), was not only ranked at level four by the factory leadership, but also refused to promote the advanced work method created by Xie. More seriously, Xie Zhipeng and his car were transferred to the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee Party School. The factory leadership claimed that if he did not go, he would be transferred to "study." In addition, those who were transferred to "study" included Ding Helin, who had just completed his training, and Xiong Peng, a driver who had not had an accident in three years, and many others. Why were these people transferred to study? According to the workers, it was because most of them had raised opinions to the leadership, and the factory leaders said that they were transferred to study for "everyone's progress." However, the progress they were talking about was not based on the level of communist consciousness, but on the standard of not daring to raise opinions to the leadership. From the following examples, it can also be seen that the factory leadership has a serious style of "reporting good news but not bad news." When they see news in the newspaper that praises the factory, they either cut it out and paste it up, or circle it with a red pen and paste it up. But when they encounter criticisms of them in the newspaper, even the newspaper is hidden.

The factory leadership's reliance on non-working-class ideas and suppression of criticism has seriously dampened the workers' production enthusiasm and political enthusiasm. The Jiangxi Provincial People's Government Transportation Bureau should also be responsible for this issue. Although the Provincial Department of Transportation wrote a letter to the newspaper saying that it had ordered the Transportation Bureau to conduct a review, and Director Wang of the Transportation Bureau also expressed his intention to conduct a review, the phenomenon of the factory leadership suppressing criticism has not changed much so far. Therefore, the reader requests the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission to promptly investigate and deal with it.

### 南昌汽车修理厂副厂长官僚主义作风严重  对向报纸反映意见的工人进行报复

    南昌汽车修理厂副厂长官僚主义作风严重
    对向报纸反映意见的工人进行报复
    读者天鸣来信揭发：江西省运输局南昌汽车修理厂副厂长曲振东、王显胜和王志毅官僚主义作风严重，虽经江西工人报（一九五二年十一月二十九日）和中南工人日报（一九五三年一月二十日）揭露，但两个月来，该厂领导方面不是虚心地检查自己，相反地却迁怒于提意见的工人，最初是追查，接着就进行报复。他们企图把提意见的工人调去“学习”或调走，来扼死批评。
    南昌汽车修理厂中的压制批评的“打手”就是该厂领导方面最信赖的人——工务员饶纪勋。饶在解放前，是伪十五宪兵团包“团副”的大徒弟、伪公路局第二运输处操纵汽车上的暗号（即“快”、“慢”、“静”三个字）的主持人。他每月要每个司机送他五块银元和五加仑汽油，做他的特别费用。他还三次包庇和保释特务中队长周西成（被判徒刑十五年已病死狱中）。该厂虽然经过民主改革，但因为改革不彻底，所以像饶纪勋这样的坏分子，到现在还骑在工人头上胡作非为。
    江西工人报批评该厂以后，坏分子饶纪勋为投领导方面之所好，就把送去的报纸统统收藏起来，不让工人看，并公开要他所属的生产组长追查反映情况的工人。副厂长王志毅也在随时查问工人：“是不是你搞的？”
    该厂领导方面为打击反映情况的工人，副厂长曲振东竟在成立工人纠察队的大会上公然说：“我们厂内有不少工人有意见不当面提（其实是提了不理，反给扣帽子、报复和打击），却随意地乱反映。现在组织纠察队，看他们还敢不敢这样！”工会副主席吴伯熙不但不宣传成立工人纠察队的意义，却也随着厂长的意图说：“我们厂内不少工人今天提行政上的意见，明天提工会的意见，现在组织起纠察队，如果以后再这样，就把他关起来！”这就更把全厂闹得人心惶惶。
    该厂行政和工会负责人，一方面以组织纠察队来恐吓工人，不许向报社反映情况，一方面则以压低工资和调工作的隐蔽方式来进行报复。突出的例子是，凡和饶纪勋关系搞得好的人，工资定的就高，如黄耀卿是饶的师兄弟、“十三太保”之一，据他自报，出过三次事故，也翻过车，但他的工资却被列为最高的一级——五级。相反的，对一九五一年节省汽油最多、行驶公里和安全第一的模范，一九五二年又创单人驾驶木炭车工作法的谢志鹏（详见今年一月二十二日北京工人日报），该厂领导方面不但把他的工资列为四级，而且竟拒不推广谢所创造的先进工作法。更严重的是，把谢志鹏连同汽车都一起调到中共江西省委党校去。该厂领导方面声称：如果他不去，就要调他去“学习”。另外，调去“学习”的人则有：才受训期满的丁鹤林，三年没出过一次事故的司机熊鹏等多人。为什么调这些人去学习呢？据工人反映，是因为他们大多数人向领导方面提过意见，而该厂领导人在调他们学习时竟说是为了“大家进步”。但他们所说的进步，不是以共产主义的觉悟程度为标准，而是以对领导方面不敢提意见为标准。从下述事例中也可以看出该厂领导方面存在着严重的“报喜不报忧”的作风。他们一看到报纸上有表扬该厂的消息时，不是剪下贴起，就是用红笔圈了贴起来；但一遇到报纸上批评他们，就连报纸都被藏起来了。
    该厂领导方面不依靠工人阶级的思想和压制批评的作风，已严重地打击了工人的生产热情和政治积极性。对于这个问题，江西省人民政府运输局也应负责。该省交通厅虽写信给报社说已责成运输局作检讨，运输局王局长也表示要检讨，但该厂领导方面压制批评的现象至今还没有什么改变。因此，读者要求中共江西省委纪律检查委员会迅速检查处理。
