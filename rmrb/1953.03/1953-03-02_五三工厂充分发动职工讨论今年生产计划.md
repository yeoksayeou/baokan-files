    Five Three Factory Fully Mobilizes Workers to Discuss This Year's Production Plan

    [This Newspaper News] According to Workers' Daily news: The national model factory—Five Three Factory, has deeply mobilized all employees to discuss the 1953 production plan.

    The Five Three Factory's production plan for this year will increase output by 43% compared to last year's actual completion, and costs will be reduced by another 2% based on last year's 8% reduction. To ensure the over-fulfillment of this plan, the factory fully mobilized all employees to discuss this year's production plan and, after conducting key experiments in the second, third, and fifth main workshops and achieving results, launched a comprehensive effort.

    Before mobilizing employees to discuss the production plan, the Five Three Factory first conducted thorough and meticulous ideological education to fully prepare.

    The first step was to organize cadres to study documents and instructions from higher authorities, and to promptly criticize any incorrect ideas that emerged during the study. During the study, some cadres only saw last year's achievements and developed blind optimism; most cadres believed that all potential had been exhausted in recent years, and this year would be like "squeezing oil from buckwheat husks." After summarizing and analyzing these ideological situations, the leadership gave a report to everyone, pointing out the favorable conditions for the factory to formulate a good plan from all aspects, and comparing the current industrial production situation in the Soviet Union with the factory. This greatly increased the cadres' confidence.

    Next, the leadership called on everyone to further tap the potential of production, and, after sufficient research in advance, pointed out that the tips found in the past were not broad and deep enough, and were only part of the potential. Therefore, the location of the tips was proposed, and employees were mobilized to find tips; technicians and staff were organized to go to the workshops to help workers find tips in a planned manner. At the same time, the situation of tapping potential was analyzed and studied: for example, although labor organization was improved and potential was tapped last year, the equipment utilization rate was still 40% lower than that of the Soviet Union on average, and in some cases, it was even twice as low. For example, a certain machine tool only reached 49 revolutions per minute, while the same machine tool in the Soviet Union could rotate more than 100 revolutions per minute. According to this analysis, workers tapped potential, and the machine tool speed in the second workshop increased by an average of 20%, and the third workshop increased by an average of 30%. The leadership also inspected the promotion of advanced experiences last year and found that some were not thoroughly promoted, and some were not universally promoted. For example, multi-spindle operation was only implemented in the first and second processes in these three workshops last year, and many processes can be implemented this year; only a dozen machine tools in the factory implemented a certain improvement last year, and this year, these three workshops alone can implement more than 40 machine tools. After preliminary analysis, the factory can exceed the annual production plan by 10% in terms of output. In terms of reducing costs, after preliminary comprehensive calculation, the total cost can also be reduced by 4% compared to the plan. Ways have also been found to improve product quality.

    After this specific ideological education work, the cadres had a clear understanding. Then they returned to the workshop to mobilize the workers to discuss the production plan. The method was to systematically carry out current political education on the three major tasks of the country this year in conjunction with the ideological situation of the workers, and to hold exhibitions to encourage the workers with facts such as the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the great construction achievements of the motherland in the past three years, the construction of the factory in the past three years, the inventions and creations of the workers in this workshop in recent years, the great achievements of the Soviet Union in building socialist communism, etc. They also organized the workers to watch the Soviet film "Donbass Miners," etc., to inspire the creativity of the workers. After being inspired by current political education, the workers generally asked the leadership to issue indicators and carry out technical improvements. Some workers automatically conducted experiments to speed up the machine. Worker Zhang Mingshan took the initiative to combine with technician Wang Gui to find a tip that could save 13,000 kilograms of kerosene a year.

    On this basis, the discussion and formulation of the plan began. The steps and methods are as follows:

    First, focus on experiments and train backbones. The second, third, and fifth workshops were taken as the focus of the experiment, and a key group was selected in each workshop. The key experimental workshop first trained workshop cadres and foremen and group leaders, organized them to study documents, and helped them find existing problems and the direction of finding tips. When organizing Party members and Youth League members for training, the arrangements were also very specific. First, the workshop cadres found the key, raised specific questions, and then asked Party members and Youth League members to lead the masses to solve them step by step. In addition, an activist meeting was held. The trade union also held several conferences, such as the All-Factory Foremen and Group Leaders Conference to exchange the experience of the Ninth Team of the Second Workshop in formulating plans; the Advanced Producers Conference introduced the advanced methods of Zhang Xihe and Sun Weicheng in formulating plans; the All-Factory Technicians Conference discussed concentrating efforts to solve the ten key problems. In this way, before the Five Three Factory announced the plan indicators, it set off a climax of finding tips, tapping potential, solving key problems, and brewing a good plan.

    Second, take the workshop as a unit, specifically explain the key problems to everyone, the trade union put forward the slogan "Strive to solve the key problems," and put forward topics. This can concentrate efforts to solve key problems, and will not be like the past when a lot of tips were put forward, but did not grasp the key problems. For example, the Second Workshop, according to the eleven key problems of the workshop, put forward 34 topics. After workers' discussion and research, 84 tips were put forward in two days. These tips were reviewed and determined to be fully usable, and the created value was very large. Only the tips of the first team to save a certain material can save 1.2 billion yuan a year.

    Third, mobilize technicians and staff to go deep into the workshop. After the technicians and staff went to the workshop, they not only simply helped the workers to calculate the details, but also educated the workers on economic knowledge, helped the workers to find tips to solve key problems, and formulate plans, and also helped the workers to improve or establish systems and improve work. After the workshop plan was formulated, the technicians and staff returned to the sections to formulate the section plan. All the technicians and staff of the factory formed 19 professional groups to go to the workshop. In this way, the key problems of the workshop can be concentrated as the main content of the section plan, so that the plan will not be empty.

    Fourth, hold a grand ceremony to issue production targets. The workshops held the "Determination Conference to Accept New National Tasks," and made preparations in advance to allow everyone to report and dedicate the achievements made in solving key problems to the conference. The group indicators are written on red paper and distributed to everyone. At the meeting, the workers challenged and responded to each other, expressing their determination to complete the plan.

    After the plan was issued, typical introductions were immediately carried out, setting off a climax of plan formulation. In addition to taking out a person and a group to formulate a "sample" of the plan, each workshop also found a typical example of learning from others' advanced experience to formulate a good plan. In order to quickly formulate a personal guarantee plan, the method of "every process (the process is the group) cultivates typical examples" was adopted. After the indicators were issued, each process immediately took out a typical personal guarantee plan. This played a great role in promoting it.

    When the groups generally formulated plans, the workshop leadership paid attention to helping the weak links. The Second Workshop generally expected that the groups could complete the annual national plan more than a month in advance, but the Eighth Team could only complete it 16 days in advance. The workshop leadership immediately organized forces to provide specific assistance, clearly pointed out the potential, and mobilized foremen to rely on the masses to deeply excavate and carefully search. As a result, they could also complete the national plan comprehensively one and a half months in advance, so that the production of the workshop could be carried out evenly.

    After the plan was formulated, it was reviewed layer by layer in a timely manner: the group reviewed the individual, and the workshop reviewed the group. If there were any improper places, they were pointed out in a timely manner for discussion and correction. Finally, the method of approval layer by layer was adopted to approve the plan.

    After the plan was formulated, a grand meeting was held to express the determination to complete the national plan, and the workers were mobilized to revise the group covenants and guarantee contracts (workshop contracts). Finally, labor protection, welfare, and technical safety measures were incorporated into the collective contract to ensure the realization of the plan.

    五三工厂充分发动职工讨论今年生产计划
    【本报讯】据工人日报消息：全国的模范工厂——五三工厂，已深入地发动了全体职工讨论一九五三年生产计划。
    五三工厂今年的生产计划，在产量方面比去年的实际完成量增加百分之四十三，成本要在去年已降低百分之八的基础上再降低百分之二。为了保证超额完成这个计划，该厂充分发动了全体职工讨论今年生产计划，并在第二、三、五三个主要车间进行重点试验取得成绩后，全面展开。
    五三工厂在发动职工讨论生产计划前，首先深入、细致地进行思想教育，充分做好准备工作。
    第一步是组织干部学习文件和上级的指示，及时批判学习中暴露出来的不正确思想。学习中，部分干部只看到去年的成绩，产生了盲目乐观情绪；大部分干部则认为几年来潜在力都挖尽了，今年是“荞麦皮挤油”。领导方面归纳、分析了这些思想情况后，就向大家作报告，从各方面指出本厂能制订好计划的有利条件，并列举苏联目前工业生产中的情况和本厂对比。这就大大提高了干部的信心。
    接着，领导方面号召大家进一步挖掘生产的潜在力量，并事先经过充分的研究，指出过去找到的窍门不够广泛、深入，只是潜在力的一部分的情况。于是提出窍门的所在，发动职工找窍门；组织技术人员和职员下车间，帮助工人有计划地找窍门。同时分析研究了挖潜在力的情况：例如，去年虽经过改善劳动组织、挖潜力，但设备运用率与苏联相比，平均还差百分之四十，个别的竟相差一倍。如某种机床每分钟只达四十九转，苏联同样机床每分钟可转一百多转。工人根据这个分析进行挖掘潜在力，第二车间机床转速平均提高百分之二十，第三车间平均提高百分之三十。领导方面又检查了去年推广先进经验的情况，发现有的推广得不彻底，有的推广得不普遍。如多机头作业，这三个车间去年只有头道二道实行了，今年就有很多工序可以实行；去年全厂只有十几台机床实行了某种改进，今年仅这三个车间就有四十多台机床可以实行。经过初步分析，全厂在产量方面，能超过全年生产计划百分之十。在降低成本方面，经初步综合计算，总成本也能比计划降低百分之四。在提高产品质量方面，也找到了办法。
    经过这种具体的思想教育工作后，干部心中有了数。然后他们回到车间发动职工讨论生产计划。办法是结合职工思想情况，系统地进行关于国家今年三大任务的时事政治教育，并举办展览会，用抗美援朝的胜利、祖国三年来的伟大建设成就、全厂三年来的建设、本车间职工几年来发明创造的成绩、苏联建设社会主义共产主义的伟大成就等等事实鼓舞职工，还组织职工看苏联影片“顿巴斯矿工”等，启发职工的创造性。职工在受到时事政治教育的启发后，普遍要求领导方面发布指标，并进行技术改进。有的工人自动作加快机器转速的试验。工人张明善主动地和技师汪贵结合，找出了一年可省煤油一万三千公斤的窍门。
    在这个基础上，开始讨论和制订计划。步骤与方法如下：
    第一、重点试验，训练骨干。以第二、三、五车间作为试验的重点，每个车间又选择了一个重点小组。重点试验车间首先训练车间干部和工长、组长，组织他们学习文件，并且帮助他们找出存在的问题和找窍门的方向。组织党员、团员训练时，布置也很具体，先由车间干部找出关键，提出具体问题，然后要求党员、团员带动群众，有步骤地加以解决。此外，还召开了活动分子会议。工会也召开了几次大会，如召开全厂工长、组长大会，交流第二车间九道小组制订计划的经验；召开先进生产者会议，介绍了先进人物张喜贺、孙维成制订计划的先进方法；召开全厂技术人员大会，讨论集中力量解决十大关键问题。这样，五三工厂在公布计划指标以前，就掀起了找窍门、挖潜力解决关键问题、酝酿订好计划的热潮。
    第二、以车间为单位，把关键问题具体地向大家交代，工会提出“为解决关键问题而奋斗”的口号，并提出课题。这就能集中力量解决关键问题，不会像过去窍门提了一大堆，却没有抓住关键问题。如第二车间，根据车间的十一个关键问题，提出三十四个课题，经过职工讨论、研究，两天中就提出八十四个窍门。这些窍门经过审查，确定全部可用，而且创造的价值很大。仅头道小组节省某种料的窍门，全年就可以节省十二亿元。
    第三、发动技术人员和职员深入车间。技术人员和职员下车间后，不只单纯帮助工人算细账，还要对工人进行经济知识的教育，帮助工人找窍门解决关键问题，订出计划，同时帮助工人改进或建立制度，改进工作。车间计划订完后，技术人员和职员再回到科室，订科室计划。全厂技术人员和职员共组成十九个专业小组下车间。这样就能集中车间关键问题作为科室计划的主要内容，使计划不致订得空洞。
    第四、举行隆重仪式，发下生产指标。车间分别召开“接受国家新任务决心大会”，事先作好准备工作，让大家把已取得的解决关键问题的成绩向大会报捷、献礼。小组指标写在红纸上，发给大家。会上，工人互相挑战应战，表示完成计划的决心。
    计划发下后，立即进行典型介绍，掀起订计划的热潮。各车间除拿出一个人和一个小组订计划的“样板”外，还找出学习别人先进经验订好计划的典型。为了迅速订好个人保证计划，采取了“道道（道就是小组）培养典型”的办法。指标发下后，各道马上拿出典型的个人保证计划来。这起了很大的推动作用。
    小组普遍制订计划的时候，车间领导方面注意帮助薄弱环节。第二车间一般小组预计都能提前一个多月完成全年国家计划，八道小组却只能提前十六天。车间领导方面马上组织力量去具体帮助，明确指出潜力所在，动员工长依靠群众深挖细找，结果也能提前一个半月全面完成国家计划，使车间的生产能够均衡地进行。
    订出计划后，及时层层审查：小组审查个人，车间审查小组。有不妥当的地方，及时指出讨论修正。最后采取层层批准的方法，批准计划。
    计划制订出后，隆重举行了表示决心完成国家计划的大会，并发动工人修改小组公约、保证合同（车间合同）。最后，将劳动保护、福利和技术保安措施订入集体合同中，以保证计划的实现。
