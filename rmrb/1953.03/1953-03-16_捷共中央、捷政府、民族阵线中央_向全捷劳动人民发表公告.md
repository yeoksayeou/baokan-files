Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 15th: The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, and the Central Action Committee of the National Front jointly issued an announcement to all working people of Czechoslovakia on the 14th, which reads in full as follows: Comrades, dear friends!
    The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, and the Central Action Committee of the National Front announce with extremely heavy hearts to the entire Party and the entire people of Czechoslovakia: Comrade Klement Gottwald, President of the Czechoslovak Republic and Chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, passed away at 11:00 a.m. on March 14th after suffering a brief but serious illness.
    To save the life of Comrade Klement Gottwald, all possible human efforts were exhausted. In this regard, the Soviet government gave the Czechoslovak people great and friendly assistance. The doctors treating the President were the best in the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. Comrade Gottwald himself fought bravely against the disease, and remained remarkably lucid almost until his death. Unfortunately, we were ultimately unable to save the life of the person we loved and respected most.
    The Czechoslovak people are facing a difficult, extremely difficult moment. Not long after the death of the great Stalin, the Czechoslovak people have suffered a new and immeasurable misfortune. The beloved leader of our country's working people, the most outstanding and most loyal student of Lenin and Stalin in our country, the true father of our free, people's democratic state, has passed away.
    Comrade Gottwald, who founded our Communist Party and forged it into a new type of party of the Lenin-Stalin type, has departed from us forever.
    Comrade Gottwald, who taught our people how to defeat capitalists, exploiters, and enemies of the people, and who resolutely united the Czech and Slovak working people in this struggle, has left us.
    Comrade Gottwald, who forever united the people of all our nationalities in an unbreakable alliance of Czechoslovak-Soviet friendship, has left us.
    Comrade Gottwald, who firmly and unswervingly led our people in the great struggle against the fascist occupiers and for national freedom, has left us.
    Comrade Gottwald, who led us in establishing a new order in our country liberated by the heroic Soviet army, so that capitalists, landlords, and foreign imperialists could no longer rule our country, and so that the working class could rule in fraternal unity with all strata of the working people, has left us.
    Comrade Gottwald, who opened up for us the bright prospects of socialism, the prospects of peace, people's prosperity, and happiness, and who constantly taught us how to build socialism in our country, has left us.
    Comrade Gottwald, who constantly cared for the strengthening of our national defense forces, and who wisely urged our armed forces to stand on the side of the glorious Soviet army to defend our country, defend world peace, and prepare to counter any conspiracy by the aggressors, has left us.
    Comrades, dear brothers and sisters!
    The loss our people have suffered is inestimable and irreparable. However, just recently, Comrade Gottwald emphasized to us, as the great Stalin taught us: even in the most difficult days, we should not lose courage, and we should not forget our great tasks and goals. Now, we must follow his instruction. Weakness and confusion must not be allowed in our ranks.
    We must unite even more firmly around the Central Committee of our Communist Party, around the government of our National Front!
    We must make the unity of our people in this difficult period as solid as a rock. We must advance even more resolutely and selflessly on the path of Lenin and Stalin, on the path pointed out to us by Comrade Gottwald!
    We must unite even more closely with our supporter and role model—the great Soviet Union and its glorious Communist Party!
    We must heighten our vigilance even more, and inflict a fatal blow on all those who attempt to undermine the unity of our Party, the Czechoslovak National Front of working people in our cities and countryside!
    We will carry out our construction tasks with greater strength. We named our first Five-Year Plan the Gottwald Five-Year Plan: now, we will devote all our strength to completing this plan as he demanded, we will devote all our strength to building socialism in our country, we will devote all our strength to more effectively thwarting the evil conspiracies of the warmongers, and to making our country an invincible fortress in the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Comrade Gottwald's name will live forever among the Czechoslovak people, in our hearts, and in our cause.
    Czechoslovak shock troops advance under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, on the road of Gottwald!
    Long live the Czechoslovak Communist Party, forever loyal to Gottwald's legacy according to Lenin-Stalinist teachings!
    Long live the friendship and fraternal unity of the Czechoslovak and Soviet peoples!
    Long live the strong and courageous Czechoslovak people, inheriting the traditions of Hus and Gottwald!
    Long live our beloved Czechoslovak motherland!
    May the Czechoslovak motherland prosper and become strong, worthy of the glory of its greatest son, Comrade Klement Gottwald!

                The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party
                The Government of the Czechoslovak Republic
                The Central Action Committee of the National Front
                                              (Signed)

    捷共中央、捷政府、民族阵线中央
    向全捷劳动人民发表公告
    【新华社布拉格十五日电】捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会、捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府、民族阵线中央行动委员会十四日共同向捷克斯洛伐克全体劳动人民发表公告，全文如下：同志们，亲爱的朋友们！
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会、捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府、民族阵线中央行动委员会以极沉痛的心情通告全党和捷克斯洛伐克全体人民：捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统、捷克斯洛伐克共产党主席克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志在患了短期重病之后，于三月十四日上午十一时逝世了。
    为了挽救克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志的生命，已用尽一切人力所能做到的办法。在这方面，苏联政府给了捷克斯洛伐克人民以伟大的友好的帮助。为总统治病的都是苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的第一流医生。哥特瓦尔德同志自己也英勇地和疾病斗争，差不多到临终的时候，他的神志还是十分清楚的。不幸，我们终于无法挽救我们所最敬爱的人的生命。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民遇到困难的、十分困难的时刻了。在伟大的斯大林逝世后不久，捷克斯洛伐克人民又遭到了新的、不可估量的不幸。我国劳动人民的敬爱领袖，列宁和斯大林在我国的最优秀和最忠实的学生，我们自由的、人民民主的国家的真正父亲逝世了。
    建立了我们共产党并把它锻炼成为一个列宁—斯大林式的新型政党的哥特瓦尔德同志和我们永别了。
    教导我国人民如何击败资本家、剥削者和人民的敌人，并在这个斗争中坚决地把捷克劳动人民和斯洛伐克劳动人民团结在一起的哥特瓦尔德同志离开我们了。
    把我国各族人民和苏联各族人民永远地团结在牢不可破的捷苏友好联盟中的哥特瓦尔德同志离开我们了。
    坚定地、始终不渝地领导着我国人民进行反对法西斯占领者、争取国家自由的伟大斗争的哥特瓦尔德同志离开我们了。
    领导我们在为英勇苏军所解放的我国境内建立新的秩序，使资本家、大地主和外国帝国主义者不能再统治我国，使工人阶级得以在和劳动人民各个阶层的兄弟团结中进行统治的哥特瓦尔德同志离开我们了。
    为我们开辟了光明的社会主义前途的伟大远景，和平、人民繁荣和幸福的远景，并经常教导我们如何在我国建设社会主义的哥特瓦尔德同志离开我们了。
    经常关怀我国国防力量的加强，英明地督促我们的武装部队站在光荣的苏军一边保卫我们的国家、保卫世界和平、准备对侵略者的任何阴谋予以反击的哥特瓦尔德同志离开我们了。
    同志们，亲爱的兄弟姊妹们！
    我们人民遭遇到的这个损失是无法估计、不可弥补的。然而，就在最近，哥特瓦尔德同志还向我们着重指出，正如伟大的斯大林教导我们的那样：即使在最困难的日子里，我们也不应该失掉勇气，不应该忘记我们的伟大任务和目标。现在，我们必须遵照他的这个训示。我们队伍中不容许有软弱和混乱的现象。
    我们要更加坚定地团结在我们共产党中央委员会的周围，团结在我们民族阵线的政府的周围！
    我们要使我们人民在这个困难的时期的团结像磐石一样巩固。我们要更加坚决地、更加忘我地在列宁、斯大林的道路上前进，在哥特瓦尔德同志为我们指出的道路上前进！
    我们要和我们的支持者和榜样——伟大的苏联和它的光荣的共产党——更加紧密地团结在一起！
    我们要更加提高我们的警惕性，并对一切企图破坏我们党、我们城乡劳动人民的捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线的团结的人给予致命的打击！
    我们将以更大的力量来执行我们建设的任务。我们把我们的第一个五年计划命名为哥特瓦尔德五年计划：现在，我们将像他所要求的那样拿出我们的全部力量来完成这个计划，我们将拿出全部力量来在我国建设社会主义，我们将拿出我们的全部力量来更有效地粉碎战争贩子的罪恶阴谋，并使我国成为以苏联为首的世界和平阵营中的一个不可战胜的堡垒！
    哥特瓦尔德同志的名字将永远活在捷克斯洛伐克人民中间，活在我们的心中，活在我们的事业中。
    捷克斯洛伐克突击队在列宁、斯大林的旗帜下，在哥特瓦尔德的道路上前进！
    对依照列宁—斯大林学说的哥特瓦尔德遗训永远忠诚的捷克斯洛伐克共产党万岁！
    捷克斯洛伐克人民和苏联人民的友谊和兄弟团结万岁！
    坚强勇敢的、继承胡斯和哥特瓦尔德传统的捷克斯洛伐克人民万岁！
    我们亲爱的捷克斯洛伐克祖国万岁！
    祝捷克斯洛伐克祖国繁荣富强，以无愧于它最伟大的儿子克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志的光荣！
                捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会
                捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府
                民族阵线中央行动委员会
                                              （签署）
