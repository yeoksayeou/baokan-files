Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: Central-level cadres of the Party, government, and military systems have, after participating in activities commemorating Comrade Stalin in recent days, redoubled their efforts to study in a spirit of unity. On the 12th, cadres of all agencies began studying documents commemorating Comrade Stalin in accordance with the regulations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The Committee of Agencies Directly Under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, upon receiving the Central Committee's notice on the 11th, immediately notified the Party committees of each directly subordinate agency to arrange for the reading of documents starting on the 12th. On the 12th, it also convened a joint meeting of cadres from the Party committees and general branches of agencies directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Party branch secretaries from various departments of the Central Committe of the CCP, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the People's Daily, the Workers' Daily, the China Youth Daily, and the Marx-Lenin Institute, to specifically arrange the study. Currently, the advanced groups and Classes A, B, and C for theoretical study in each agency have suspended their regular theoretical study and are concentrating on studying documents commemorating Comrade Stalin. The method of study: first read the documents, then hold seminars and discussions. Problems discovered in the seminars and discussions will be answered and reported on by responsible cadres or cadres with a higher level of political theory from each agency. Questions raised during the study by various directly subordinate agencies will be forwarded to the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The cultural schools of the various directly subordinate agencies will not suspend classes; comrades studying culture will mainly be lectured or have seminars by propagandists and reporters.

When arranging the study, the Committee of Agencies Directly Under the Central People's Government required that junior cadres connect their thinking to improve their understanding while studying; senior cadres are required, in addition to studying well themselves, to study the questions raised by general cadres and then designate specialists to make reports within their own agencies. For comrades participating in cultural classes in various agencies, the libraries of each agency will provide popular books on Stalin's life and ask cadres to give them reports.

On the 12th, the General Political Department of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission issued a notice to major military regions stipulating that the vast number of commanders and fighters in each unit should conduct study in accordance with the regulations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. On the 11th, the General Political Department convened political work cadres and propaganda and education cadres from various departments directly under the Military Commission, various special forces, and the North China Military Region to specifically arrange the study. Senior cadres in the army will adopt the method of reading documents and holding seminars; general cadres, in addition to reading documents and discussing, will also be given one or two reports by the heads of each unit. Soldiers and general staff will adopt the method of attending large classes, attending one to three classes. The General Political Department of the Military Commission also notified each unit that, in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's notice, the army newspapers in March should prominently and continuously reflect the various activities of the troops commemorating Comrade Stalin, and organize the vast number of commanders and fighters to write articles about their experiences in this study.
