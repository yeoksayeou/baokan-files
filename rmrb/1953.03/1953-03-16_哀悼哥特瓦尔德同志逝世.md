    Mourning the Passing of Comrade Gottwald
    Telegram of condolence from the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party:
    We are deeply saddened to learn of the unfortunate passing of Comrade Klement Gottwald, Chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and President of the Czechoslovak Republic, on March 14th. The Chinese people share the deep sorrow of the Czechoslovak people.
    Klement Gottwald was the great leader of the Czechoslovak people. He led the Czechoslovak people, with the assistance of the heroic Soviet army, to liberate themselves from the clutches of fascism; he led the Czechoslovak people in socialist construction, enabling them to embark on the path to a happy life.
    Klement Gottwald was an outstanding fighter in the world's camp of peace and democracy. His life of struggle made brilliant contributions to the common cause of the world's camp of peace and democracy, headed by the Soviet Union.
    Klement Gottwald was a close friend of the Chinese people. Under his leadership, the Czechoslovak Republic established friendly diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and signed cultural and economic cooperation agreements. This not only strengthened the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples but also enhanced the strength of the world's camp of peace and democracy. The Chinese people will always cherish the fraternal unity between the two peoples.
    Although the Czechoslovak people have lost their most beloved leader, we believe that they will unite even more closely around the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Czechoslovak government to strive to fulfill Gottwald's legacy and advance socialist construction. The Chinese people vow to strengthen unity with the Czechoslovak people and to fight for the consolidation of the camp of peace and democracy, headed by the Soviet Union.
