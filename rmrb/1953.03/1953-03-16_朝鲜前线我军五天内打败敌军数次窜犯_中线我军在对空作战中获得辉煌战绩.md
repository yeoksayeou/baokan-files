Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 15th: In the five days from the 7th to the 11th of this month, the enemy continuously intruded upon our army's positions, but they were all disastrously defeated.

　　On the Western Front, at dawn on the 10th, two companies of American troops, under the cover of artillery fire, intruded upon an outpost position of our army near Shangpu, southwest of Tieyuan. This group of enemies launched eight consecutive assaults on our army's position in over an hour, but each time they were repelled by our army's fierce artillery and infantry fire. In this battle, a total of 156 enemies were killed or wounded, and 21 automatic rifles and other weapons were captured.

　　On the same day, on the Central Front, a company of Rhee's troops attacked one of our army's positions near Shanmingli, northwest of Tieyuan. They were met with strong artillery fire from our army, and the dense shells fell into the enemy ranks, scattering them in all directions. More than 130 enemies were killed or wounded.

　　On the Eastern Front, on the night of the 10th, a group of Rhee's troops intruded upon an advanced position of our army west of Wendengli. Our ambush team let the enemy's vanguard pass and intercepted the enemy's follow-up troops, inflicting heavy blows. The enemy abandoned three corpses and fled in defeat. The vanguard of the enemy was also routed by our troops defending the position.

　　In addition, in other ambush and raid battles, our army completely annihilated two reinforced platoons of American troops, two squads each of Turkish mercenary troops and Rhee's troops, totaling more than 160 enemies eliminated.

　　In these five days, our army's mobile artillery fire killed or wounded a total of 318 enemy soldiers. Frontline anti-aircraft artillery fire shot down eight enemy aircraft and damaged ten.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 15th, by our correspondent Ding Gu: Our army on the central front has achieved brilliant results in air defense operations. In the forty-four days from January 15th to February 28th, our army on the central front shot down or damaged a total of 156 enemy aircraft, including 61 shot down. The wreckage of these downed enemy aircraft mostly fell on our army's positions.

　　This victory was jointly achieved by our frontline anti-aircraft artillery units using mobile anti-aircraft tactics and infantry units extensively carrying out anti-aircraft shooting campaigns. Before the "Dingzi Mountain" battle, enemy aircraft bombed and strafed our army positions day and night. A certain anti-aircraft artillery unit of our army, under the slogan "Where there are many enemy aircraft, set up the artillery and shoot there," quickly moved the anti-aircraft artillery to the "Dingzi Mountain" position. On January 24th, the enemy dispatched 148 sorties of enemy aircraft to attack the area. The heroic gunners calmly fired fierce artillery fire at the enemy aircraft amidst the flying shrapnel, and after more than three hours of fierce fighting, shot down five enemy aircraft and damaged two. Another day, as soon as they moved the artillery to another position, six enemy aircraft came and circled the nearby mountains to reconnoiter. They immediately deployed all anti-aircraft weapons, and as soon as the enemy aircraft approached their fire zone, they were suddenly attacked by dense fire. In an instant, one enemy aircraft was seen falling in flames, and another was wounded, while the remaining four enemy aircraft were frightened and scrambled to escape.

　　Our infantry units also formed many anti-aircraft shooting groups with light and heavy machine guns, rifles, automatic rifles, and other weapons to tightly guard the sky. One day, four enemy F-80 jet fighters bombed and strafed a certain position of our Shangganling. Squad leader Yang Jingming immediately jumped out of the tunnel with an automatic rifle in his hand. Taking advantage of the enemy aircraft's frantic dive and strafing, he calmed down, aimed at the lead aircraft, and fired seven consecutive bullets, shooting down the enemy aircraft. Han Lang, a second-class merit recipient and light machine gunner of a certain unit, shot down and damaged one enemy artillery spotting aircraft each in two days. A machine gun company of a certain unit also shot down three enemy aircraft and damaged one in a two-hour battle.

    朝鲜前线我军五天内打败敌军数次窜犯
    中线我军在对空作战中获得辉煌战绩
    【新华社朝鲜前线十五日电】本月七日到十一日五天中，敌人不断地向我军阵地窜犯，又都遭到了惨败。
    在西线，十日黎明，美军的两个连在炮火掩护下向铁原西南上浦防附近我军的一个前哨阵地窜犯。这股敌人在一个多钟头内，向我军阵地连续冲锋八次，每次都被我军猛烈的炮火和步兵火力所击退。这次战斗共毙伤敌一百五十六名，并缴获自动步枪等二十一枝。
    同日，在中线，李伪军一个连向铁原西北山明里附近我军的一个阵地攻击，遭到我军强大炮火的拦阻，密集的炮弹落在敌人群里，把敌人打得东逃西散，敌人死伤一百三十多人。
    在东线，十日夜间，一股李伪军向文登里以西的我军一个前沿阵地窜犯。我军的伏击队将这股敌人的先头部队放过去，把敌人的后续部队拦住痛击，敌人丢下三具尸首溃逃；先头的一股敌人也被我军守阵地的部队击溃。
    此外，我军在另外一些袭击、伏击战斗中，又全歼美军两个加强排、土耳其帮凶军和李伪军各两个班，计歼敌一百六十多名。
    这五天中，我军前线游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军三百一十八名；前线高射炮火共击落敌机八架，击伤敌机十架。
    【新华社朝鲜前线十五日电】本社记者丁固报道：中线我军在对空作战中获得辉煌战绩。从一月十五日到二月二十八日的四十四天中，中线我军共击落、击伤敌机一百五十六架，其中击落六十一架。这些被击落的敌机残骸多坠落于我军阵地。
    这个胜利是我前线高射炮部队用游动打敌机的战法和步兵广泛开展对空射击运动所共同取得的。在“丁字山”战斗以前，敌机曾日夜不息地向我军阵地轰炸扫射，我军某高射炮部队便在“那里敌机多，就把炮架到那里打”的口号下，迅速把高射炮移上“丁字山”阵地。一月二十四日，敌人出动了一百四十八架次敌机袭击该地。英勇的炮手们在弹片纷飞中沉着地向敌机射出了猛烈的炮火，激战三个多小时，击落敌机五架，击伤两架。另一天，他们刚把炮移到另一个阵地上，就来了六架敌机，在附近山头上盘旋侦察。他们立即布置好所有高射火器，敌机刚接近他们的火力圈就遭到密集火力的突然射击，一霎眼，就见一架敌机冒着火焰坠落下来，另一架受了伤，其余四架敌机吓得狼狈升高逃去。
    我步兵部队也把轻、重机枪、步枪、自动步枪等各种火器，组成许多对空射击小组，严密地守卫着天空。一天，四架敌F—80型喷气战斗机向我上甘岭某阵地投弹、扫射。班长杨京明马上握着自动步枪跳出坑道，趁敌机疯狂俯冲扫射时，他沉住气，瞄准领航机迎头射击，连续发出七发子弹，就把这架敌机打了下来。某部二等功臣、轻机枪射手韩朗，曾在两天中打落打伤敌炮兵校正机各一架。某部机枪连，一次在两小时的战斗中也打落敌机三架，打伤一架。
