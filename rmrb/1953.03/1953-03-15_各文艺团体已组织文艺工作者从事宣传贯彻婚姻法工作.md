Response to People's Daily Readers' Criticism and Suggestions

	Various Literary and Art Groups Have Organized Literary and Art Workers to Engage in the Work of Publicizing and Implementing the Marriage Law
	A letter from the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles: We believe that the reader's suggestion "Literary and art workers should create a large number of works publicizing the Marriage Law" (original letter published in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on February 17) is a very good one. Now the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Chinese Artists Association, the Chinese Dramatists Association, the Chinese Musicians Association, the Chinese Ballad Singers Association and other units, as well as various cultural departments, have organized literary and art workers to engage in the work of publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    各文艺团体已组织文艺工作者从事宣传贯彻婚姻法工作
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会来信：读者建议“文艺工作者应该大量创作宣传婚姻法的作品”（原信刊二月十七日“读者来信摘要”栏），我们认为这个意见是很好的。现在全国文协、美协、剧协、音协、曲协等单位以及各文化部门已组织文艺工作者从事宣传贯彻婚姻法工作。
