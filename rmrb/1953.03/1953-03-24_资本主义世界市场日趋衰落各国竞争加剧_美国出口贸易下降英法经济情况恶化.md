Xinhua News Agency Report: Due to the decline of the capitalist world market and the intensification of competition among capitalist countries, the export trade of the United States is declining and the outlook is bleak.

According to official US statistics: The total value of US exports in 1952 was 15.16 billion US dollars. This figure is superficially more than 100 million US dollars more than exports in 1951. However, exports in 1952 included 1.98 billion US dollars of so-called "military aid" materials. In 1951, the amount of such materials was 1.55 billion US dollars. Therefore, US commodity exports actually decreased by approximately 300 million US dollars last year.

The reduction in US export trade was particularly large in agricultural products (mainly cotton), one of the main items traditionally exported by the US. According to official figures, US agricultural exports in the second half of 1952 decreased by as much as 30 percent compared to a year earlier. Cotton exports from August to December 1952 totaled 1,500,600 bales, only 51 percent of the total for the same period in 1951. Exports of other crops such as wheat, soybeans, fruits, and tobacco also decreased significantly. Goods with large reductions also included other important exports such as coal, petroleum, automobiles, and textiles.

The US Department of Commerce's monthly publication "Business Conditions" acknowledged when analyzing the trend of US trade that the reason for the decline in US exports was "increased production in the United States and other parts of the world, as well as reduced consumption in certain countries." This is just a euphemistic way of saying that foreign trade competition is increasing and the capitalist world commodity market is shrinking.

Regarding the intensifying infighting among capitalist countries in the shrinking capitalist world market, one can cite the Americans' own description of what happened in Latin America, the main foreign market of the United States. The US big business magazine "Business Week" stated: "Competitors are arriving in Latin America in droves: German salesmen are knocking on every door in Latin America; Japanese trade representatives appear periodically in every major city; the Dutch are holding trade exhibitions; every plane seems to have visitors from France and Britain."

In addition to competition from other countries, there are also import restrictions imposed on American goods by Latin American countries. For example, Brazil strengthened import restrictions in early 1952. Argentina is another major Latin American country that has implemented import restrictions. In these two major Latin American countries, the volume of US trade decreased particularly significantly last year.

According to a United Press report: The Mexican government announced on the 17th that it would stop the import of cotton fabrics in order to protect the Mexican textile industry. The Mexican Minister of Economy explained that this was due to the intensification of competition in the capitalist world market. He said that the large-scale exports of Japan and Britain have already "overburdened" the world market and caused "unprofitable competition."

In view of the above situation, "Business Week" has predicted in a low-key tone: "For American exporters, 1953 looks like it will be a year of 'difficult sales' in Latin America."

Given the bleak prospects for foreign trade, the US ruling group has been unable to hide their deep concern. Federal officials called the reduction in exports a "dangerous signal" for the entire economy. The "Wall Street Journal" said: "A reduction in exports not only affects exporters, but also affects all businesses... When manufacturers of export goods reduce sales abroad, they will reduce production and reduce purchases of other goods, which will trigger a series of repercussions throughout the economy."

	US Shipping Industry Continues to Decline

With the intensification of competition, the US shipping industry continues to decline.

United Press International reported about a month ago that "Ocean freight (American) has been declining for about a year." The agency's report said that the US shipping industry is "being squeezed in all aspects." Factors contributing to the infighting include "a large increase in the tonnage of merchant ships in West Germany, Japan, and other major maritime countries" and "a large reduction in the goods available for transportation." Under intense competition, the US shipping companies with high freight rates are "at a very disadvantageous position in world trade," and the measures taken by the United States to protect the profits of its shipping company bosses by forcing other countries to use American ships, have been subjected to "a new movement launched by European countries" to oppose it.

Not long ago, the Associated Press also released a message acknowledging that more than twenty US oil tankers have stopped sailing because of "commercial depression." Although the oil tanker lease fees have been reduced by 15 to 40 percent compared to the previously stipulated fees, business is still sluggish. The agency also revealed that hundreds of other ships transporting cloth have also been suspended due to a lack of business.

	US Capital Deepens Inroads into the Japanese Economy

US capital is increasingly penetrating the Japanese economy. According to Radio Tokyo, the Foreign Investment Committee of the Japanese Ministry of Finance has approved fifteen more contracts between foreign companies and Japanese companies regarding technical "assistance" and loans. Of these contracts, eleven were concluded with American companies. From the radio report, it is clear that these contracts enable US monopoly capital to expand its influence into Japan's metallurgy, chemical, electrical, machinery, construction, paper making, and other industries.

	Bleak Economic Prospects for Western Europe

The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe meeting held in Geneva closed on March 18. This meeting reflected the bleak situation of the Western European economy and the desire of Western European business circles to trade with Eastern Europe.

The European Economic Commission Secretariat's report on the European economic situation, submitted to the meeting, said pessimistically: Although Western European countries' military expenditures are continuing to increase, the Western European economy has stagnated in the past year and a half, and commodity demand has shrunk. International trade between Western Europe and Eastern Europe, as well as within Western Europe, is disintegrating. It is also difficult for Western European textiles to compete with low-cost Japanese textiles in the Asian and African markets. Western European products in the Asian and African markets will continue to shrink. The Western European textile industry must be regarded as a declining industry, and the production level of 1951 cannot be reached in the coming years.

British representative Redding, speaking in the discussion of this report, acknowledged that Britain has not been able to recover from the aftermath of the Second World War. Britain is experiencing serious difficulties due to inflation and dependence on the dollar area. Britain's acceptance of "aid" from the dollar area has burdened Britain with debt. Britain does not have enough markets to make up for the lack of dollars. Redding emphasized that restoring trade between European countries would provide a way out for Western European countries that are now experiencing economic difficulties.

French representative Philippe also emphasized that Western European countries cannot actually lean towards the US market. There are great obstacles to selling goods in the American market due to the protectionist trade policies implemented by the United States. When European exporters sell European goods to American consumers, they only get one US dollar for selling five US dollars worth of goods, while the remaining four US dollars fall into the pockets of American brokers. The French representative urged Western European exporters to implement a common policy in dealing with business with the United States, because they are unable to break through the American market alone. At the same time, he emphasized that doing business with Eastern European countries can improve the economic situation in Western Europe.

At the suggestion of the French representative, the meeting passed a resolution to hold a conference on trade between Eastern and Western Europe in Geneva in April of this year.

	British Industrial Production Decreases

The British "Worker's Daily" reported on the 17th: J. R. Campbell gave a report on the British economic situation at a meeting of the British Communist Party Executive Committee held in London.

Campbell pointed out that Britain's industrial production in 1952 decreased by three percent compared to 1951. The number of unemployed people in December 1952 increased by 100,000 compared to December 1951. In the docks, in 1952, an average of fifteen out of every hundred dockworkers were unemployed, compared to six in 1951.

The wages of the British working people have not kept up with the rise in the cost of living. The wages of workers in the mining, cotton spinning, wool, and clothing industries have not increased. The shrinking of the textile and decoration industries shows that the working class has had to reduce its purchases of these goods.

Campbell emphasized that Britain's economic situation is deteriorating due to the increasingly fierce competition from West Germany and Japan. Campbell said that Japan's exports to the British Empire are expanding. In East Africa, Japan sells almost four times as much cotton cloth as Britain.

	French Export Trade Shrinks

France's foreign payments deficit continues to widen due to the shrinking of export trade. According to preliminary settlement results for the European Payments Union in February, France owed 31.1 million US dollars; while the deficit in January was 10.9 million US dollars.

### 资本主义世界市场日趋衰落各国竞争加剧  美国出口贸易下降英法经济情况恶化

    资本主义世界市场日趋衰落各国竞争加剧
    美国出口贸易下降英法经济情况恶化
    美国统治集团忧虑输出下降
    据新华社讯：由于资本主义世界市场的衰落和各资本主义国家之间竞争的加剧，美国的出口贸易日益衰落，前景暗淡。
    据美国官方的统计：一九五二年美国出口总额价值一百五十一亿六千万美元。这个数目表面上比一九五一年的出口多了一亿多美元。但是，在一九五二年的出口中包括十九亿八千万美元的所谓“军事援助”物资。而在一九五一年的出口中，这类物资的数目是十五亿五千万美元。因此，美国去年的商品出口实际上减少了大约三亿美元。
    在美国出口贸易中减少得特别多的是美国历来出口的主要项目之一农产品（主要是棉花）。根据官方数字，一九五二年下半年美国农产品的输出比一年前减少达百分之三十。棉花的出口，从一九五二年八月至十二月，总量为一百五十万零六千包，只占一九五一年同期总数百分之五十一。其他的农作物，如小麦、大豆、水果和烟草的出口也大大减少。在减少得较多的商品中还包括其他重要出口货如煤、石油、汽车和纺织品。
    美国商务部出版的“商业现况”月刊在分析美国贸易的趋势时承认：美国出口下降的原因是“美国和世界其他各地生产增加以及某些国家的消费减少”。这不过是国外贸易竞争增加和资本主义世界商品市场萎缩的好听的说法。
    关于在日益萎缩的资本主义世界市场中各资本主义国家之间倾轧加剧的情形，可举美国人自己关于在美国主要国外市场拉丁美洲所发生的事情的描述来说明。美国大企业的杂志“商业周刊”说：“在竞争者成群结队到达拉丁美洲：德国的推销商人敲着拉丁美洲的每一个门户；日本的贸易代表周期地在每一个大城市出现；荷兰人在举行贸易展览会；每一架飞机似乎都有法国与英国的来客。”
    除了其他国家的竞争，还有拉丁美洲国家对美国货实施的入口限制。例如巴西就在一九五二年初加强了入口限制。阿根廷是另外一个实施了入口限制的拉丁美洲大国。在这两个拉丁美洲的主要国家，美国的贸易额去年降低得特别显著。
    据合众社消息：墨西哥政府十七日宣布停止棉织物的输入，以保护墨西哥的纺织工业。墨西哥经济部长解释这是因为资本主义世界市场上的竞争的加剧。他说，日本与英国的大量输出，已经使世界市场“过份负担”，并且造成了“得不到利的竞争”。
    由于上述情况，“商业周刊”已语调低沉地预言：“对于美国出口商说来，一九五三年看来将是在拉丁美洲‘销货不易’的一年。”
    鉴于对外贸易前途的暗淡，美国统治集团已掩藏不住他们的深切忧虑。联邦官员把输出减少称为整个经济的一个“危险的信号”。“华尔街日报”说：“出口减少不但影响出口商，而且也影响到全般企业……当出口货物的制造商在国外的销售减少时，他们就会减少生产，并且减少对其他货物的购买，这样就会激起整个经济的一连串反响。”
        美国航运业继续衰退
    随着竞争的加剧，美国航运业继续衰退。
    合众社在大约一个月以前曾报道说：“大约一年以来，（美国的）远洋运货一直在减少着。”该社的消息说，美国航运业“在各方面都受到排挤”。在造成倾轧的因素中包括“西德、日本和其他主要海运国家的商船吨数大大增加”而“可供运输的货物大量减少”。在激烈的竞争下，运费高昂的美国轮船公司“在世界贸易中处于极其不利的地位”，而美国用来保护它的航运公司老板的利润的、强迫其他国家用美国轮船运货的办法，又遭受“欧洲国家掀起新的运动”来反对。
    不久以前，美联社也发了一条消息，承认美国目前已经有二十多艘油船停止航行，原因是“商业上的不景气”。虽然油船的租赁费比官方以前规定的费用已经降低了百分之十五至四十，仍旧是生意清淡。该社还透露，另外还有几百条运输布匹的船只也因为没有生意而停航。
        美国资本加深侵入日本经济
    美国资本正日益深入地侵入日本经济。据东京电台说，日本大藏省外资委员会又批准了外国公司和日本公司缔结的十五项关于技术“援助”和贷款的合同。这些合同中，有十一项是和美国公司缔结的。由电台的报道可以清楚地看到，这些合同使美国垄断资本能够把它们的势力扩大到日本的冶金、化学、电气、机械、建筑、造纸以及其他工业中。
        西欧经济前景黯淡
    在日内瓦举行的联合国欧洲经济委员会会议已于三月十八日闭幕。这次会议反映出西欧经济的黯淡情况，以及西欧工商界渴望与东欧贸易。
    欧洲经济委员会秘书处向会议提出的欧洲经济情势报告书中悲观地说：尽管西欧各国军备费用在继续增加，西欧经济在过去一年半中已进入停滞状态，商品需要已经减缩。西欧与东欧之间以及西欧内部的国际贸易正趋瓦解。而西欧出产的纺织品又难于在亚洲和非洲市场上和成本低廉的日本纺织品竞争。西欧产品在亚洲和非洲的市场将继续缩小。西欧纺织工业必须认为是一个正在衰落中的工业，一九五一年的生产水平在今后数年内是无法达到的。
    英国代表里丁在讨论这项报告书时发言承认：英国还没有能够从第二次世界大战的余殃中恢复元气。英国感受到由于通货膨胀与依赖美元区域而引起的严重困难。英国接受美元区域的“援助”，使英国负起债务重担。英国没有足以弥补美元缺乏的市场。里丁强调说：恢复欧洲各国间的贸易，将给现在感受经济困难的西欧各国提供一条出路。
    法国代表菲利普也强调说：西欧各国实际上不能向美国市场一边倒。在美国市场上推销货物，由于美国实行保护贸易政策而受到极大障碍。欧洲出口商将欧洲货物卖给美国消费者的时候，卖五块美元仅拿到一块美元，而其余四块美元都落到美国经纪人的荷包里去了。法国代表敦促西欧出口商在与美国做生意问题上推行一种共同的政策，因为他们无力单独突破美国市场。同时，他强调指出：与东欧各国做生意是能够改善西欧的经济情势的。
    会议在法国代表提议下，通过了今年四月在日内瓦召开东西欧贸易会议的决议。
        英国工业生产量降低
    英国“工人日报”十七日报道：杰·鲁·坎贝尔在伦敦举行的英国共产党执行委员会会议上作了关于英国经济情况的报告。
    坎贝尔指出：英国在一九五二年的工业生产量比一九五一年降低了百分之三。一九五二年十二月的失业人数比一九五一年十二月增加了十万人。在码头方面，一九五二年，每一百个码头工人中平均有十五个人失业，一九五一年是六个人。
    英国劳动人民的工资赶不上生活费用的上涨，采矿、棉纺、羊毛及衣着工业的工人的工资都没有增加。纺织和装修工业的萎缩说明工人阶级已不得不减少对这些货品的购置。
    坎贝尔强调指出：由于西德与日本的竞争一天天剧烈，英国的经济状况正日趋恶化。坎贝尔说，日本向英帝国各国的输出正在扩大，在东非方面，日本所推销的棉布差不多为英国所推销的四倍。
        法国出口贸易萎缩
    法国对外支付逆差由于出口贸易的萎缩而继续加大。欧洲支付同盟二月份初步结算结果，法国亏欠了三千一百万美元；而一月份的亏欠是一千零九十万美元。
