    Getting Through to Cadre Thinking, Handing the Marriage Law to the Masses
    Tan Yingfu, Secretary of the CPC Leping County Committee
    During the period of Kuomintang reactionary rule, Leping County, Jiangxi Province, was an area with a relatively strong feudal influence. The feudal marriage system, the feudal patriarchal system, the dominance of husband power, and the ideology of valuing men over women held a dominant position among the masses. The whole county was rife with wife renting, wife pawning, wife selling, and female infanticide. Arranged marriages, child brides, prohibitions against widows remarrying, beatings, abuse, and murder of women, and rape of women were widespread. Among the broad masses of working people, there was practically no truly free marriage. Landlord despots were the biggest murderers of women. For example, the evil landlord Huang Laohu of Li Lin Township in the First District took a fancy to the wife of poor peasant Hong Yuanhe, so he colluded with the puppet township chief to conscript Hong Yuanhe twice, forcibly coercing Hong Yuanhe to "rent" his wife to him.
    In the three years since the liberation of Leping County, the feudal marriage system has been severely hit through the struggle of the broad masses, and the new marriage system has gradually grown. In the past three years, about 1,600 couples in the county who were married under unreasonable marriage systems and who truly could not live together divorced in the People's Courts, and more than 4,000 couples registered for divorce in the district governments, relieving the pain of feudal marriage and finding satisfactory partners through free love. During the land reform review and democratic unity phase, 500 young men and women freely fell in love and held new-style weddings. In the past three years, more than 10,000 couples have registered for marriage at the district governments. The erroneous saying that was once popular in the countryside, "The poor have turned over, and their wives have divorced," has now undergone a fundamental change.
    Since 1952, there have been no more child brides, "waiting-for-husband" brides, wife renting, wife pawning, or early marriages. Open buying and selling of marriages has disappeared. Beatings, abuse, and murder of women and infanticide have been greatly reduced. Harmonious, united, free, and happy families are constantly increasing.
    Because the Marriage Law stipulates the principle of protecting the interests of women and children, maternal and child health services have gradually developed. In the past three years, a total of 156 new-method midwives and 18 health workers have been trained. In 1952, a total of 1,635 male and female infants were delivered, with a mortality rate of 2.7% (before liberation, the infant mortality rate was 10%), and the phenomenon of female infanticide was effectively curbed.
    In the past three years, thanks to the implementation of the Marriage Law, women have been liberated, and their enthusiasm for labor and their participation in political activities have soared. With their own efforts and the Party's cultivation, 85 women have left production to take up work, and another 267 women cadres who are semi-detached from production and have been elected as township chiefs and deputy township chiefs. There are also more than 1,600 women activists in the countryside, most of whom have been elected as township committee members, village women representatives, directors, and group leaders. This group plays an active role in various social reforms and production movements. Nearly 100,000 women in the county are engaged in agricultural production. 11,000 people have reclaimed 7,280 mu of farmland. In the donation of airplanes and cannons movement the year before last, many women took out the gold and silver jewelry they had saved for many years to support our "most beloved people." Li Haigui, a woman from Leping Town, donated all nine qian of gold she brought with her when she divorced. They also made 8,283 pairs of comfort shoes and wrote more than 1,000 comfort letters.
    How did Leping County implement the Marriage Law?
    1. Party and government leaders attach importance to it and implement the Marriage Law in conjunction with various central tasks. After the promulgation of the Marriage Law in 1950, the CPC Leping County Committee emphasized that implementing the Marriage Law and solving the vital interests of women is one of the important weapons for mobilizing women to participate in the struggle against the feudal landlord class and eliminating feudal remnants. The county party committee also notified all districts and townships to immediately organize cadres to study the Marriage Law universally. In June 1950, Jin Shaoying, secretary of the CPC Fuliang Prefectural Committee, gave a report on the Marriage Law at the county and district cadres meeting, and personally presided over the test, laying the foundation for the implementation and study of the Marriage Law. After the end of the land reform movement in the spring of 1951, six cases of abuse and murder of women occurred one after another, which aroused the attention of party and government leaders. Analyzing the situation at that time, the main reason was that the district and township cadres themselves had a strong feudal ideology, which became an obstacle to the implementation of the Marriage Law. For example, the responsible cadres of the sixth and seventh districts were afraid that there would be too many divorce cases, so they stipulated that civil affairs assistants should handle divorce disputes once every seven days. Wang Shumin, a member of the work team in the Second District, injured the fingers of a divorced woman. Other illegal acts such as cadres leading militiamen to catch adulterers, restricting women from divorcing, not allowing them to marry people from other townships, and not allowing them to marry their lovers were even more common. Members of the county party committee went to the women's federation several times to understand the work situation and study and deploy women's work. The county magistrate and the county party committee made reports on the implementation of the Marriage Law at several people's representative conferences. In particular, at the representatives' meeting on October 26, 1952, the county party committee clearly pointed out the importance of implementing the Marriage Law, and the entire body of representatives discussed and adopted a resolution on implementing the Marriage Law. Members of the county party committee personally explained the Marriage Law and deployed women's work at various cadre meetings. This aroused the attention of district and township cadres. Song Youjun, secretary of the Second District Party Committee, personally presided over the work of the Marriage Law propaganda booth. The secretaries of the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth District Party Committees all personally grasped the district's model meetings on the Marriage Law. Many township and village cadres have always actively publicized and implemented the Marriage Law.
    The county women's federation has also made great efforts in implementing the Marriage Law in the past three years. A total of five representative meetings were held, resolving issues related to the vital interests of women. In 1951, posters of the Marriage Law were drawn and taken to various districts for exhibition. In September and October 1952, a county-wide Marriage Law publicity week was launched for a total of twenty-five days. All townships held meetings to publicize and implement the Marriage Law, so that the broad masses of men and women were educated. In September 1952, the women's federation accused the murderers, and also cooperated with the court to form a Marriage Law inspection team to go to the countryside to handle marriage cases, and participated in the jury trial of more than 100 marriage cases. In July 1952, a women's cadre training class was held to improve the working ability of women's work cadres.
    In handling marriage cases in the past three years, the court has actively supported women's struggle for freedom of marriage and protected women's rights and interests. In order to help women get rid of the pain of unreasonable marriage, after the promulgation of the Marriage Law in 1950, the court no longer required the parties to provide introduction letters, and often organized cadres to go to the countryside for circuit trials to resolve marriage disputes on the spot.
    2. Vigorously use a variety of forms to conduct publicity, and pay attention to commending models and establishing banners. From 1951 to 1952, the court alone made more than 30 reports on the Marriage Law at various meetings, training courses, and representative meetings, with more than 10,000 listeners, all of whom were cadres and core members in the countryside. Openly named and criticized cadres who violated the Marriage Law, and praised the good ones. Actively commending models, setting up banners, and holding new-style weddings have had a good impact. In the winter of 1951, when the land reform was reviewed, each township held a new-style wedding, which played a positive role in publicity. In September 1952, primary school teachers were mobilized and organized to use their spare time to publicize the Marriage Law by villages and groups. At the county and district material exchange meetings, the court and the women's federation set up publicity booths, drawing typical cases of violating the Marriage Law into cartoons for publicity, which was welcomed by the broad masses; more than 80,000 to 90,000 viewers were directly educated. Folk artists were also organized to say, sing, and compile and perform dramas about the Marriage Law, which were very popular among the masses. Now many districts and townships are using various drama forms (such as dramas, Gan operas, operas, etc.) to arrange and perform, and the influence extends to the entire county.
    3. Hand the Marriage Law to the masses to master and use, and turn it into a law that the masses consciously implement. To achieve this step, it is mainly necessary to mobilize district and township cadres and representatives and other backbone members to publicize it to the masses. The prefectural party committee secretary's test on the Marriage Law for district cadres in June 1950 and the county women's federation director's test on the Marriage Law for district and township cadres at the expanded meeting of district and township cadres in August 1951 aroused the cadres' attention to the Marriage Law. In August 1951 and September 1952, with the court and the women's federation as the main force, marriage law inspection teams were organized twice, and through the backbone members such as district and township cadres, the masses were mobilized to handle typical cases, so that the masses initially grasped the spirit of the Marriage Law. Every time the court went to the countryside for circuit trials of cases, it first studied through cadres, solicited opinions, organized mass discussions, and then publicly pronounced judgments. Not only did the grassroots cadres learn the methods of mediating marriage disputes and improve the prestige and enthusiasm of the cadres, but the greater role was to hand the Marriage Law to the masses, so that the masses could use the Marriage Law to solve the marriage disputes that occurred in themselves. This is the method of policy laws, leadership opinions, and mass meetings.
    At present, there are still some problems in Leping County in implementing the Marriage Law. Incidents of beating, abuse, murder, and insults to women still exist in individual places. Following the cases of Xu Genguang and Wu Shuizhong beating and killing their wives, Fan Yuezhi, a female cadre from Fanjia Township in the Fifth District, was assassinated in a mountain depression two li away from her home on December 10, 1952 (now under investigation). Open buying and selling arranged marriages and early marriages no longer exist in the vast rural areas, but the phenomenon of disguised buying and selling marriages and early marriages still exists individually. According to the marriage cases accepted by the court, there are still many women who should be divorced who have not been resolved. The matter of not allowing divorced women to bring property and not allowing them to marry their lovers still exists in some areas. The feudal remnants in the minds of individual cadres are still very strong. For example, Hua Zhiquan, a cultural and educational assistant in the First District, arrested Zhang Yushan, a primary school teacher, and Wang Xiangmei, a teacher, because they were in love and took them to a meeting to fight, and expelled Zhang Yushan, forcing the two to hang themselves on a tree. Based on the existing problems and the experience of implementing the Marriage Law in the past three years, the CPC Leping County Committee has decided to launch a large-scale movement to publicize and implement the Marriage Law.

    打通干部思想，把婚姻法交给群众
    中共乐平县委书记　谭英富
    江西省乐平县在国民党反动政府统治时期，是封建势力较严重的地区，封建的婚姻制度，封建的家长制度和夫权统治、重男轻女思想在群众中占着统治地位。全县租妻、典妻、卖妻、溺婴盛行。包办买卖婚姻、童养媳，不准寡妇结婚、打骂、虐待、杀害妇女和强奸妇女的现象普遍存在。在广大的劳动人民中间，真正自由结婚的根本没有。地主恶霸是迫害妇女的最大凶手。如第一区李林乡恶霸地主黄老虎看上了贫农洪元和的老婆，就勾结伪乡长连抓洪元和两次壮丁，强逼洪元和把老婆“租”给他。
    乐平县解放三年来，经过广大群众的斗争，封建婚姻制度已受到沉重打击，新的婚姻制度已逐步成长起来。三年来，全县约有一千六百对在不合理的婚姻制度下结合的、确实不能共同生活的夫妇在人民法院离了婚，有四千余对在各区政府登记离了婚，解除了封建婚姻的痛苦，经过自由恋爱找到了可心的对象。在土地改革复查民主团结阶段，有五百对青年男女自由恋爱，举行了新式结婚。三年来到区政府登记结婚的有一万余对。曾在农村中流行一时的“穷人翻了身，老婆离了婚”的错误说法，现在有了根本的改变。
    自一九五二年起，童养媳、望郎媳、租妻、典妻和早婚的事情没有了，公开的买卖婚姻已经绝迹了。打骂、虐待和杀害妇女及溺婴的事已大大减少。和睦、团结、自由、幸福的家庭不断地增多。
    由于婚姻法规定了保护妇女和儿童利益的原则，妇婴卫生事业逐步发展。三年来共训练新法接生员一百五十六名，保健员一十八名。一九五二年共接生一千六百三十五个男女婴儿，死亡率占百分之二点七（解放前儿童死亡率占百分之十）而且有效地制止了虐杀女婴的现象。
    三年来由于贯彻执行了婚姻法，妇女获得了解放，妇女的劳动热情和参加政治活动的积极性空前高涨。妇女在自己的努力与党的培养下，有八十五名脱离生产参加了工作，另有半脱离生产的乡干部及当选乡长、副乡长（二十一人）的妇女干部二百六十七名。农村中还有妇女积极分子一千六百多名，他们多数被选为乡委员、村妇女代表、主任和小组长。这批人在各种社会改革和生产运动中起着积极的作用。全县参加农业生产的妇女将近十万人。有一万一千人开荒田七千二百八十亩。在前年捐献飞机大炮运动中，许多妇女把多年积存的金银首饰拿出来支援我们“最可爱的人”。乐平镇妇女李海规把离婚时带来的九钱金子全部捐献了。她们并做了慰问鞋八千二百八十三双，写慰问信一千多封。
    乐平县是怎样贯彻执行婚姻法的呢？
    一、党、政领导重视，结合各种中心工作贯彻婚姻法。一九五零年婚姻法颁布后，中共乐平县委就强调提出：贯彻婚姻法，解决妇女切身利益问题，是发动妇女群众参加反对封建地主阶级斗争、消灭封建残余思想的重要武器之一。县委并通知各区、乡立即组织干部普遍学习婚姻法。一九五零年六月间，中共浮梁地委书记金少英在县区干部大会上作了婚姻法的报告，并亲自主持测验，打下了贯彻与学习婚姻法的基础。一九五一年春土地改革运动结束后，曾接连发生了六件虐杀妇女的案件，更引起了党政领导干部的注意。分析当时的情况，主要是区、乡干部本身有浓厚的封建思想，成为贯彻婚姻法的阻力。如六、七区负责干部怕离婚案件太多，规定民政助理员七天办一次离婚纠纷。第二区工作队工作人员王树民把离婚妇女的手指打伤了。其他如干部带领民兵捉奸，限制妇女离婚，不准嫁外乡人，不准嫁相好的等不法情事就更多。县委委员曾几次到妇联了解工作情况，研究和布置妇女工作。县长、县委在几次各界人民代表会议上，都作了贯彻婚姻法的报告。特别是一九五二年十月二十六日的代表会议上，县委明确地指出了贯彻婚姻法的重要性，经全体代表讨论通过作出了关于贯彻婚姻法的决议。县委委员在各种干部会议上都亲自讲解婚姻法，布置妇女工作。这样引起了区、乡干部的重视。二区区委书记宋有钧自己主持婚姻法宣传棚的工作。三、四、五、八区区委书记都亲自掌握区的婚姻法模范会议。乡、村干部一贯积极宣传贯彻婚姻法的很多。
    三年来县妇联在贯彻婚姻法工作中也作了很大的努力。共召开代表会议五次，解决了妇女切身利益问题。一九五一年画了婚姻法挂图，拿到各区展览。一九五二年九、十月间，共二十五天的时间，开展了全县性的贯彻婚姻法的宣传周。各乡都开了宣传贯彻婚姻法的会，使广大男女群众受到了教育。一九五二年九月间妇联控诉了杀人的凶犯，更配合法院组成婚姻法检查小组下乡处理婚姻案件，参加陪审婚姻案件一百多件。一九五二年七月办了妇女干部训练班，提高了妇女工作干部的工作能力。
    三年来法院在处理婚姻案件中，积极支持妇女争取婚姻自由的斗争，保障了妇女的权益。为了帮助妇女解除不合理婚姻的痛苦，一九五零年婚姻法颁布后，法院就不再向当事人要介绍信，并经常组织干部下乡巡回审判，就地解决婚姻纠纷。
    二、大张旗鼓地运用多种多样的形式进行宣传，并注意表扬模范，树立旗帜。一九五一年至一九五二年，仅法院就在各种会议、训练班、代表会作婚姻法的报告三十余次，听众一万余人，都是农村中的干部和骨干分子。对违反婚姻法的干部进行了公开指名的批评，对好的则加以表扬。积极的表扬模范，树立旗帜，举行新式结婚，发生了良好的影响。一九五一年冬土地改革复查时，每乡都举行了新式结婚，在宣传上起了积极作用。一九五二年九月，动员与组织了小学教师，利用课余时间，分村分组宣传婚姻法。在县、区举行物资交流会上，法院与妇联都搞了宣传棚，把典型的违犯婚姻法的案件画成漫画进行宣传，受到广大群众的欢迎；直接受到教育的观众有八、九万人。民间艺人也被组织起来，说唱和编演婚姻法的戏剧，很受群众欢迎，现在有不少区、乡都运用各种戏剧形式（如话剧、赣剧、歌剧等）编排演出，影响及于全县。
    三、把婚姻法交给群众掌握和运用，变成群众自觉执行的法令。做到这一步，主要是要发动区、乡干部和代表等骨干分子，向群众宣传。一九五零年六月地委书记对区干部婚姻法的测验，及一九五一年县妇联主任在区、乡干部扩大会上对区、乡干部的测验，引起干部对婚姻法的重视。一九五一年八月和一九五二年九月，以法院、妇联为主，两次组织了婚姻法检查组，通过区、乡干部等骨干分子，发动群众处理典型案件，使群众初步掌握了婚姻法的精神。法院每次下乡巡回审判案件时，都首先通过干部研究，征求意见，组织群众讨论，再公开判决，不但使基层干部学会了调解婚姻纠纷的办法，提高了干部的威信和积极性，更大的作用是把婚姻法交给了群众，使群众能够运用婚姻法解决本身所发生的婚姻纠纷。这是政策法令、领导意见和群众见面的方法。
    目前乐平县在贯彻执行婚姻法方面还有一些问题。打骂、虐待、杀害和侮辱妇女的事件，在个别的地方还存在。继徐根光、吴水忠打杀妻子案件之后，第五区范家乡女干部范月枝在一九五二年十二月十日被人暗杀在离家二里远的山坞里（现正侦查中）。公开的买卖包办婚姻和早婚在广大的农村里已经没有了，但变相的买卖婚姻和早婚现象还个别存在。根据法院受理的婚姻案件来看，还有许多应该离婚的妇女没有得到解决。不准离婚妇女带财产，不准嫁相好男人的事，还在某些地区存在。个别干部封建残余思想还很浓厚。如第一区文教助理员华志泉因小学教员张余山与王香妹恋爱，被民兵抓去开会斗争，就把张余山开除，逼得二人双双吊死在一棵树上。根据目前存在的问题和三年来贯彻婚姻法经验，中共乐平县委已决定开展一个大规模的宣传贯彻婚姻法运动。
