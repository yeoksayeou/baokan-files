Leading Cadres in Longxi Special District, Fujian Province
Neglect Forest Fire Prevention Work

In the Longxi Special District of Fujian Province, which includes Longxi, Zhao'an, Changtai, Yunxiao, Pinghe, and Hua'an counties, forest fires have occurred continuously. According to incomplete statistics, from November 1952 to the present, there have been 24 cases of mountain fires. Among these, the eight mountain fires that occurred in Longxi, Changtai, and Zhao'an counties alone burned 13,787 mu of mountain forest. From the perspective of the entire forest protection work in Fujian Province, the Longxi Special District is the area with the most serious forest fires.

On December 11th last year, farmers Han Taishan, Han Fuchun, and four others from Panyue Township, Fifth District, Longxi County, caused a forest fire by burning grass on the ridges of their fields on Tianbao Mountain. The fire burned continuously for two days and two nights, spreading from Dapu Ping to Wufeng Mountain. A subsequent investigation revealed that this fire burned more than 11,000 mu of mountain forest, resulting in very serious losses. In late November last year, Chen Xiagen, a farmer from Jiuhu Township, Ninth District of the same county, caused a mountain fire by burning land for reclamation on Guanyin Duzuo Mountain in Xintang Township, destroying more than 40,000 public-private partnership planted Masson pine trees.

After the mountain fires occurred, the local leading organs and certain leading cadres adopted a bureaucratic attitude of either sitting idly by or failing to organize timely rescue efforts. For example, after the fire broke out on Tianbao Mountain, the district head of the Fifth District of Longxi County watched the fire spread from below the mountain without leading the masses to put it out. At the time, Gong Sui, a cadre from the Longxi Forest Farm, asked the district head to lead the masses to rescue the fire, but he ignored the request. After a fire broke out on Zhegu Mountain in the Third District of Changtai County at noon on November 19th last year, the secretary of the CCP District Committee of this district did not lead the masses to put out the fire until the morning of the 20th, by which time more than 1,500 mu of mountain forest had been burned. When the fire broke out on Tianbao Mountain, it could be seen very clearly from in front of the Longxi County People's Government and from the Longxi Special Commissioner's Office building, but the leading cadres of the county and special district turned a blind eye to the forest fire so close at hand and ignored it. From November last year to the present, there have been 24 consecutive serious forest fires in the entire special district, and the leading cadres of the special district are unaware of the extent of the damage in 23 of these cases.

Not only is forest fire prevention work poorly done in the counties of the Longxi Special District, but the leadership of overall forestry production is also insufficient. The forestry representative meeting that should have been held in Longxi County last year did not take place because leading cadres said they could not spare cadres to preside over it. During last year's afforestation campaign, due to the lack of thoroughness in the leadership of the special district, attention was only paid to completing the "task" of planting trees. The leaders didn't combine afforestation with educating the masses to pay attention to cultivation, and the survival rate of afforestation in the entire district was only 49%, lower than any other special district in the province. Similarly, due to the neglect of forestry work by the leading cadres here, forestry cadres were transferred to lead agricultural production. At the same time, there was a lack of concrete leadership, and seedling cultivation techniques were not well mastered. Of the 175 mu of tree species sown in the special district last spring, 64 mu did not survive.

### 福建省龙溪专区领导干部  忽视护林防火工作

    福建省龙溪专区领导干部
    忽视护林防火工作
    福建省龙溪专区所属的龙溪、诏安、长泰、云霄、平和、华安等县连续发生森林火灾。据不完全统计，从一九五二年十一月份到现在，已发生烧山案件二十四起。其中只龙溪、长泰、诏安三县发生的八次山火，就烧毁山林一万三千七百八十七亩。从福建省整个护林工作来看，龙溪专区是发生森林火灾最严重的地区。
    去年十二月十一日，龙溪县五区盘月乡农民韩泰山、韩福春等六人在天宝大山烧田埂上的草引起了森林火灾，连续燃烧了两天两夜，蔓延的地区从大埔坪烧到五峰山。事后调查这次火灾共烧毁山林一万一千多亩。损失十分严重。去年十一月下旬，该县九区九湖乡农民陈吓根在新塘乡观音独坐山烧垦引起山火，烧毁公私合作营造的马尾松四万多株。
    在山林火灾发生后，当地领导机关和某些领导干部竟采取坐视不管或不及时抢救的官僚主义态度。如天宝大山发生火灾后，龙溪县五区区长在山下看着火势蔓延，也不领导群众抢救。当时龙溪林场干部龚遂要求区长带领群众抢救，他竟置之不理。长泰县三区鹧鸪山去年十一月十九日中午发生火灾后，直到二十日早晨这个区的中共区委书记才带领群众去抢救，这时已烧毁了山林一千五百多亩。天宝大山发生火灾时，在龙溪县人民政府门前和龙溪专署的楼上都能看得很清楚，但是县和专区的领导干部对于近在眼前的森林火灾，竟熟视无睹，不去理睬。这个专区从去年十一月份到现在全区连续发生严重的森林火灾二十四起，该专区领导干部不明了损失情况的就有二十三起。
    龙溪专区各县不但护林防火工作作得不好，对整个林业生产的领导也很不够。龙溪县应在去年召开的林业代表会，就由于领导干部说抽不出干部来主持，便没有开成。在去年造林运动中，也由于该专区领导不深入，只注意完成栽树“任务”，没有结合造林教育群众注意抚育，全区的造林成活率只有百分之四十九，低于全省的任何一个专区。同样由于这里的领导干部忽视林业工作，把林业干部调去领导农业生产，同时缺乏具体领导，对育苗技术也没有很好掌握，该专区在去年春季播种的一百七十五亩树种，就有六十四亩没有成活。
