Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: News from Tokyo: After the Japanese Diet passed a vote of no confidence in the Yoshida Cabinet, the faction-ridden and infighting Japanese ruling Liberal Party has formally split. Ichiro Hatoyama, Yoshida's old rival within the party, and others are forming a new party.
　　In the critical moment when the House of Representatives was about to vote on the no-confidence motion against the Liberal Party's Yoshida government on the 14th, twenty-two Liberal Party members, led by Miki Bukichi, an important aide to Hatoyama in the Hatoyama group's "Democratic Alliance," first formally announced their departure from the Liberal Party and voted in favor of the no-confidence motion. After the no-confidence motion passed, Hatoyama also announced his departure from the Liberal Party on the 15th, forming a new party provisionally named the "Japan Liberal Party" with Miki Bukichi and the other twenty-two as its core, to participate in the upcoming general election. In order to eliminate dissidents, Yoshida expelled more than thirty members of the Hirokawa group, including Hirokawa Kozen, who had caused the House of Representatives to pass a motion to punish Yoshida, from the party on the 16th. The Hirokawa group then decided to join Ichiro Hatoyama's new party. The new party is scheduled to be formally established on the 22nd.
　　The split of the Liberal Party will further weaken the power of the Japanese ruling clique, intensify internal strife, and make the political situation in Japan more turbulent. Even the Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun" admitted this. The newspaper's editorial on the 15th, discussing the situation after Yoshida dissolved the Diet, said: "During this period, some scandalous political struggles will occur to compete for power." When speculating on the next cabinet, the newspaper expressed pessimism about the Liberal Party, saying: "The distrust of the Liberal Party has been clearly demonstrated, and it is illogical for the Liberal Party to succeed itself. It must be remembered that the no-confidence motion is not only against the Yoshida Cabinet, but against the entire Liberal Party." As for the possibility of the Progressive Party forming the next cabinet, "Mainichi Shimbun" said: "Without the cooperation of the now-split Liberal Party or the right-wing Socialist Party, it cannot take action either inside or outside the cabinet." The newspaper also asked skeptically: "Even if a Progressive Party cabinet is formed... will it not be short-lived?" The "Mainichi Shimbun" editorial finally had to come to a pessimistic conclusion: "Japanese politics will have a complex and difficult period."

    日本统治集团内部纷争加剧
    当政的自由党已正式分裂
    【新华社十八日讯】东京消息：在日本国会通过对吉田内阁的不信任案以后，派系林立、倾轧不已的日本当政的自由党已正式分裂，吉田的党内老对头鸠山一郎等正在另组新党。
    在十四日众议院即将表决对自由党吉田政府的不信任案的紧要关头，鸠山集团的“民主化同盟”中以鸠山的重要助手三木武吉为首的二十二个自由党议员，首先正式宣布脱离自由党，并投票赞成不信任案。在不信任案通过以后，鸠山接着也在十五日宣布脱离自由党，以三木武吉等二十二人为核心另组暂时名叫“日本自由党”的新党，来参加即将到来的大选。吉田为了排除异己，在十六日把曾使众议院通过对吉田的惩罚案的广川弘禅等三十多个广川集团的众议员开除出党。广川集团随即决定参加鸠山一郎的新党。新党定于二十二日正式成立。
    自由党的分裂将使日本统治集团的势力进一步削弱，内部的纷争更为加剧，日本的政局更加动荡。这连日本资产阶级报纸“每日新闻”也加以承认，该报十五日社论谈到吉田解散国会之后的局面说：“在这个时期中，会发生一些丑态百出的政治斗争，来争夺统治权。”该报在推测下一届内阁时，对自由党表示悲观说：“对自由党的不信任已经明显地表现出来，由自由党来继承自己是不合乎逻辑的。必须记住，不信任案不仅是反对吉田内阁的，而且是反对整个自由党的。”至于由改进党组织下届内阁的可能性，“每日新闻”说：“如果没有现在分裂的自由党或右派社会党的合作，它无论在内阁里面或外面都不能采取行动。”该报并且怀疑地问道：“即使接着成立一个改进党的内阁……它能不短命吗？”“每日新闻”社论最后不能不得出一个悲观的结论：“日本的政治将要有一个复杂而困难的时期。”
