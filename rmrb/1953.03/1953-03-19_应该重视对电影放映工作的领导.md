Editor's Note: The criticism of Shandong Province Cultural Bureau leaders' lack of attention to film screening work by Shandong Province Film Team projectionists Li Tongji and others is correct. We agree with the serious handling of this matter by the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee. Film is one of the most effective tools for conducting propaganda and education among the people, and neglecting leadership in this work is very inappropriate. We hope that the Shandong Province Cultural Bureau will earnestly correct its leadership of film screening work, and we hope that cultural authorities in various localities will regularly inspect this aspect of leadership work and continuously improve it.

Letter from Readers Li Tongji and others:

To the Editor: The Shandong Province Cultural Affairs Bureau does not pay enough attention to the people's film work. In this regard, not only have comrades raised many opinions, but the East China Culture Department has also given instructions, but the leadership's thinking in the Cultural Bureau has not been fundamentally changed.

The broad masses of farmers in the old areas of Shandong urgently demand the development and improvement of the people's film industry due to the improvement of their living standards, but the Provincial Cultural Bureau does not pay attention to it. The chief of the "Drama Reform and Film Section" has rarely visited the Shandong Provincial Film Team (which currently has twenty-two teams) and has never studied the development of the people's film industry in Shandong Province. Regarding the issue of unified management of cinemas, although the bureau received instructions from the Government Administration Council long ago, it suppressed the instructions. Only after the former East China Culture Department convened a film work conference in various provinces and pointed out Shandong Province's mistake of not paying attention to film work did the Cultural Bureau make some changes in form. The "Drama Reform and Film Section" was renamed the "Film and Drama Reform Section," and a "joint organization" of three people was established, but after its establishment, it did not specifically study the work, and the cinemas have not been unified under management to this day.

During the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," all twenty-two teams of the provincial film team set off, and the heads of the headquarters also went to the countryside, meeting with more than 100,000 people every day. However, the leading cadres of the Shandong Provincial Cultural Bureau neither made specific arrangements and instructions beforehand, nor did Deputy Director Ding Zhigang mention the work of the film team at all when summarizing the achievements of various units of the Provincial Cultural Bureau in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month."

Because the Cultural Bureau does not pay attention to film screening work, it does not promptly and carefully handle the housing problem that the film team staff urgently need to solve, and it does not care about the health of the projectionists at all. The film team has only sixty scattered houses. After deducting the twenty-eight rooms occupied by necessary offices such as offices, warehouses, and repair rooms, the small team's dormitory and office are only thirty-two rooms (administrative personnel also live in them). Thirteen people have to live in one small room, so that many projectionists suffered from infectious diseases in the summer, which affected daily work and study. Later, the film team's trade union requested handling in the name of all members, and the result was a "paperwork trip" in a big circle, and finally the original text was returned, saying: "Solve it yourself!" Recently, the film teams that set off in various places returned to the team to conduct work summaries, and housing has become even more of a problem. Deputy Director Ding Zhigang actually told us to notify the comrades who set off not to come back and stay in the special commissioner's office. Is this caring for the comrades? The comrades carry the machines during the day and travel, and show movies until midnight before resting. They are tired and sick, and their feet are frozen and swollen, but they don't complain. When the task is completed, the leadership does not allow them to come back. What is this for? This situation should be changed quickly.

Reply from the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee to the Literature and Art Group of the People's Daily:

We have received a letter from a reader forwarded to us. We immediately dispatched Comrade Feng Yizhi, director of the Culture and Art Department of our department, to investigate and deal with it. After investigation and understanding, most of the opinions raised are indeed accurate and correct.

We believe that the leading cadres of the Provincial Cultural Bureau have one-sided, simplistic views and bureaucratic work styles regarding film screening work in their thinking. The Propaganda Department of the Shandong Branch also has insufficient understanding and lack of leadership in this work. Therefore, some problems have not been resolved in a timely manner.

In order to handle this issue more carefully, we have individually learned about the situation from the responsible cadres of the film team and exchanged views with some leading comrades of the Cultural Bureau. On the 7th of this month, Feng Yizhi, director of the Literature and Art Department of the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Branch, together with Wang Tongzhao and Ding Zhigang, the director and deputy director of the Cultural Bureau, convened a symposium of cadres above the squadron level of the film team. At the meeting, democracy was fully developed, and Comrade Ding Zhigang made a review on behalf of the Cultural Bureau and expressed his acceptance of everyone's reasonable suggestions. This meeting basically communicated the relationship between superiors and subordinates. Now the Cultural Bureau is actively studying how to strengthen the leadership of film work in the province, preparing to enrich the film management work organization (establish a separate film section and equip it with a certain number of cadres), and striving to find ways to solve some specific problems existing in the film team (such as housing, treatment, etc.).

### 应该重视对电影放映工作的领导

专栏：

    应该重视对电影放映工作的领导
    编者按：山东省电影队放映员李统绩等对山东省文化局领导干部不重视电影放映工作的批评是正确的，我们赞同中共中央山东分局宣传部对这件事情的认真处理。电影是向人民群众进行宣传教育的最有效的工具之一，忽视对这一工作的领导，是很不应该的。我们希望山东省文化局切实改正对电影放映工作的领导，并望各地文化主管部门经常检查这一方面的领导工作，不断加以改进。
    读者李统绩等的来信
    编辑同志：山东省文化事业管理局对人民的电影工作是不够重视的。在这方面，不仅同志们提了不少意见，就是华东文化部也有过指示，但总未根本扭转文化局的领导思想。
    山东老区的广大农民，由于生活水平的提高，迫切要求着人民电影事业的发展和提高，但省文化局是不过问的。“剧改电影科”科长很少到过山东省电影队（该队现有二十二个队），对人民电影事业在山东省的发展，从未加以研究。影院的统一管理问题，局内虽早就接到政务院的指示，却把指示压起来，到前华东文化部召开了各省电影工作会议，指出了山东省对电影工作不重视的错误后，文化局才在形式上有了一些改变。“剧改电影科”改为“电影戏改科”，成立了三个人的“联合组织”，但成立后未具体的研究过工作，影院至今也未统一管理。
    “中苏友好月”中，全省电影队二十二个小队全部出发，总队部的负责人也都下了乡，每天和十多万群众见面。但山东省文化局的领导干部事先既不作具体布置和指示，事后丁志刚副局长在总结省文化局各单位在“中苏友好月”中各项活动的成绩时，竟一字不提电影队的工作。
    文化局由于对电影放映工作的不重视，对电影队工作人员急待解决的房舍问题也不及时地慎重处理，对放映员的身体健康毫不关心。电影队仅有六十间分散的房子，除去办公室、仓库、修理室、伙房等必要的办公室占去二十八间外，小队的寝室兼办公室只三十二间（行政人员亦住在内），一间小房内要住十三个人，以至在夏季有不少放映员患了传染病，影响了日常工作和学习；后由电影队工会以全体会员名义要求处理，结果“公文旅行”了一大圈，最后原文交回说：“自行解决！”最近出发各地的电影队回队进行工作总结，房舍更成问题，丁志刚副局长竟叫我们通知出发的同志不要回来，留在专署。这就是对同志们的关心吗？同志们在外面白天背着机器赶路，晚上放电影到夜半才休息，累成了病，脚都冻肿了，也没叫苦。等完成了任务，领导上却不让回来，这是为了什么呢？这种情况，应该迅速加以改变。
        山东省电影队放映员　李统绩　秦玉瑞
                                    张冠明　朱士鑫
                                    张庆水　刘汉忠
    中共中央山东分局宣传部的答复人民日报文艺组：
    你处转来读者来信一件，收到。我们当即派本部文化艺术处处长冯毅之同志前往调查处理。经过调查了解，所提意见大部分是确凿的而且是正确的。
    我们认为省文化局的领导干部对电影放映工作，在思想上是存在着片面化、简单化的看法及官僚主义作风。山东分局宣传部也对这工作认识不足和缺乏领导。因之，有些问题未能及时得到解决。
    我们为了更慎重地处理这个问题，曾找电影队负责干部个别地了解了情况，并同文化局一些领导同志交换了意见；于本月七日，由山东分局宣传部文艺处冯毅之处长，协同文化局王统照、丁志刚正副局长，召集了电影队中队以上干部的座谈会。会上充分发扬了民主，由丁志刚同志代表文化局作了检讨，并表示接受大家合理的建议。这个会议基本上沟通了上下间的关系。现在文化局正积极进行研究如何加强对全省电影工作的领导，准备充实电影管理工作的机构（单独成立电影科，并配备一定的干部），和努力设法解决电影队存在的一些具体问题
    （如房子、待遇等问题）。
