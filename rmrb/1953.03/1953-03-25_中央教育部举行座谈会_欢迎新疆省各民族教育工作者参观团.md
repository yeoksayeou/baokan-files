    The Central Ministry of Education held a symposium on the 23rd to welcome the educational workers delegation from all ethnic groups of Xinjiang Province. Zhang Xiruo, Minister of the Central Ministry of Education, delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting, extending a warm welcome to the delegation. He said that in order to meet the needs of national construction and to implement the ethnic policies in the Common Program, governments at all levels attach great importance to the work of training ethnic cadres. The large-scale training of ethnic cadres is the central link in carrying out various construction undertakings in ethnic areas. Therefore, training cadres has become the primary task of ethnic education work at this stage. In order to train minority youth to become various senior and intermediate construction talents, the Central People's Government has established nine ethnic institutes in Beijing, Northwest, Southwest, Central South and other places in the past three years, and various regions have also opened ethnic cadre training classes. At present, more than 70,000 minority cadres have been trained nationwide. Zhang Xiruo pointed out that because minority nationalities were oppressed by reactionary rulers and Han chauvinism in the past, they had few opportunities to study and lacked intellectuals. Therefore, under the rapid development of ethnic education in the past three years, there has been a particular shortage of teachers. On the one hand, we have established normal schools for longer-term training, and on the other hand, we have adopted short-term training and rotation training methods to improve the old and train new ethnic education teachers. Lin Li Ru, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education, pointed out in his speech that the guiding principle for educational construction this year is: consolidation, key development, guaranteeing quality, and steady progress. In minority areas, appropriate development can be made according to conditions and needs. He called on everyone to start from this year, according to the central government's guidelines and policies, combined with the actual situation of various ethnic areas, to formulate plans and act according to plans. Anwar Khan Baba, the head of the delegation, introduced the situation of ethnic education work in Xinjiang Province in the past three years and the existing problems, and expressed that he would learn from the advanced education work experience in the interior during this visit to improve the ethnic education work in Xinjiang Province. The members of the delegation also introduced the educational work in various ethnic areas at the meeting, and raised difficult problems regarding school buildings, equipment, teaching materials, and teachers. Finally, Zhang Xiruo said: These situations and problems are of great help to the Central Ministry of Education in improving ethnic education work. He also pointed out that the above-mentioned various difficult problems were brought about by the development of ethnic education work, but they must and can be gradually studied and resolved.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: The educational workers delegation from all ethnic groups of Xinjiang Province, led by Anwar Khan Baba (Uzbek), Director of the Education Department of the People's Government of Xinjiang Province, and deputy heads Turdi Airi (Uyghur) and Chemai (Kazak), arrived in Beijing on the 22nd from Dihua. The Central People's Government Ministry of Education held a symposium on the 23rd to welcome them. The educational workers delegation from all ethnic groups of Xinjiang Province consists of fifty-eight people including Xinjiang education administrators, primary and secondary school principals, and teachers, including educators from eleven ethnic groups including Uyghur, Kazakh, Uzbek, Tajik, Tatar, Hui, Russian, Mongolian, Kirgiz, Xibe, and Han. The purpose of their visit is to understand the achievements of the motherland's construction in the past three years, to enhance the understanding of the great motherland among educators of all ethnic groups, and to learn from the advanced education work experience in the interior in order to improve the quality of education work of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The delegation is divided into two major groups, secondary education and primary education, focusing on Beijing, Dalian, and Harbin, and will visit East China and Central South after visiting North China and Northeast China.

    欢迎新疆省各民族教育工作者参观团
    【新华社二十四日讯】中央教育部于二十三日举行座谈会，欢迎新疆省各民族教育工作者参观团。中央教育部部长张奚若在会上致欢迎词，对参观团表示热烈的欢迎。他说，为了国家建设的需要和实现共同纲领中的民族政策，各级人民政府很重视培养民族干部的工作。大量地培养民族干部是开展民族地区各项建设事业的中心环节，因此，培养干部便成为现阶段民族教育工作的首要任务。为了培养少数民族青年成为各种高级和中级建设人材，中央人民政府三年来在北京、西北、西南、中南等地创办了九所民族学院，各地区还开办了各民族干部训练班。现全国已培养七万多名少数民族干部。张奚若指出，少数民族由于过去受反动统治者大汉族主义的压迫，很少有读书机会，知识分子很缺乏。因此，在三年来民族教育迅速发展的情况下，特别感到师资缺乏，我们一方面创办师范学校，作较长期的培养，一方面采取短期训练和轮训的办法，来提高旧的和培养新的民族教育师资。教育部副部长林砺儒讲话中指出今年教育建设的方针是：整顿巩固，重点发展，保证质量，稳步前进。在少数民族地区根据条件与需要，可作适当发展。他号召大家从今年开始，根据中央的方针政策，结合各民族地区的实际情况，订好计划，按计划办事。参观团团长安瓦尔汗巴巴在会上介绍了新疆省三年来民族教育工作的情况和存在的问题，他表示要在这次参观中学习内地先进教育工作经验，以改进新疆省民族教育工作。参观团的团员们在会上也介绍了各民族地区的教育工作情况，并提出关于校舍、设备、教材以及师资等方面的困难问题。最后，张奚若表示：这些情况和问题对中央教育部改进民族教育工作上有很大帮助。他还指出：上述各种困难问题，是随着民族教育工作的发展带来的，但必须，也一定可以逐步地研究解决。
    【新华社二十四日讯】新疆省各民族教育工作者参观团在团长新疆省人民政府教育厅厅长安瓦尔汗巴巴（乌兹别克族）和副团长吐尔的艾里（维吾尔族）、切迈（哈萨克族）率领下在二十二日从迪化来到北京。中央人民政府教育部在二十三日举行座谈会表示欢迎。新疆省各民族教育工作者参观团由新疆省教育行政工作者和中小学校长、教师等五十八人组成，包括维吾尔、哈萨克、乌兹别克、塔吉克、塔塔尔、回族、俄罗斯、蒙族、柯尔克兹、锡伯、汉族等十一个民族的教育工作者。他们参观的目的是了解祖国三年来建设的成就，以增进各族教育工作者对伟大祖国的认识，并学习内地先进教育工作经验，以提高新疆各民族教育工作的质量。参观团分中等教育和初等教育两大组，以北京、大连、哈尔滨为参观重点，在华北、东北参观后将赴华东、中南各地游览。
