Our country's large-scale economic construction has begun, and striving to learn technology has become an urgent requirement of the vast number of young workers. Therefore, how to solve the problem of young workers learning technology, and how to better strengthen the political and ideological education of League members and the vast number of young workers, has become a serious task facing League organizations in factories, mines, basic construction, and the transportation industry. "Strive to Complete the Five-Year Plan in Four Years," "The Work of a Communist Youth League Branch in a Workshop," and "Young League Members in Enterprises Talk About Their Work," these three books, are introductions of successful experiences by some outstanding factory League secretaries, workshop League secretaries, and League group leaders in the Soviet Union. Undoubtedly, if we learn these advanced experiences well, it will be of great help to the work of the League in our factories and mines.

Comrade Stalin said that competition is a communist method of engaging in socialist construction. We know that in various factories and mines, young workers account for a large number of all workers; therefore, mobilizing all young workers to actively participate in socialist competition has become a serious political task of the League organizations in factories and mines. But how can this glorious task be accomplished? The books tell us that, first of all, we must wage a relentless struggle against all forms of formalism, and we must do a thorough job of ideological mobilization, so that every young person understands: what benefits the development of socialist competition will bring to the motherland, all the people, and himself; if he does not work well, what losses it will cause to his workshop, factory, and even the entire country, thereby strengthening his sense of responsibility. At the same time, with the assistance of foremen and production team leaders, help each young person correctly formulate his own socialist competition plan or guarantee conditions. After the competition begins, throughout the entire competition process, the League must organize regular and continuous inspections of the youth's competition activities, and promptly conduct summaries, promote advanced experiences, commend outstanding producers, and drive the laggards. Any phenomena that hinder the development of competition must be exposed in a timely manner through various forms, and criticism and self-criticism must be carried out, and there must be absolutely no compromise with it.

To victoriously carry out socialist competition, we must constantly improve the technical proficiency of young people. The books also point out specific ways to solve this problem. First, organize various technical learning groups according to different types of work. Second, establish "Stakhanov Schools," that is, organize a group of young workers, with Stakhanov workers from the factory or workshop as teachers, to demonstrate their advanced production methods to them without separating from production, and to help them master these advanced production methods on-site within a certain period of time. Third, organize meetings between young people and Stakhanov workers, that is, Stakhanov workers report their advanced experiences to young people or give on-site demonstrations. Fourth, organize core workers and veteran workers to regularly assist young people in mastering production techniques during the production process. Fifth, widely introduce the advanced experiences of Stakhanov workers to young people through newspapers, wall newspapers, etc. The above methods and forms can be used simultaneously and alternately. But first, it is necessary to educate all young people, stimulate their desire to learn technology, and accurately understand the knowledge level and ideological situation of each person.

All activities of the League must be combined with ideological and political education. There are many methods and forms for carrying out this work, the main ones are: First, organize various political study groups. Second, organize various reports and lectures. Third, organize young people to read various books, especially literary works. Because "books teach young people to treat life thoughtfully and to care about comrades. Young people see that the most valuable people are those who are not afraid of difficulties, have noble life goals, and overcome all difficulties to achieve this goal. Books have also taught many people to have a persevering spirit, helping them to overcome some initial difficulties. Books also teach people to learn one thing: to be proud of the motherland and the Soviet people. And this feeling inspires people to consciously and selflessly work." ("Strive to Complete the Five-Year Plan in Four Years") Fourth, according to the requirements of young people, invite veteran workers or others to tell revolutionary stories they have personally experienced. Fifth, hold open League member meetings (that is, absorbing the participation of a large number of young people), and bring up major issues in current production and learning, or the behavior of League members and young people that violate labor discipline, etc., to the meeting for everyone to discuss. Sixth, convey the resolutions and instructions of the Party and the higher-level League committee to League members and non-League youth, and organize them to discuss them. Seventh, through individual conversations, deeply understand and effectively educate each person. This point is very important, especially League group leaders should widely use this method. As Voronkov, the League group leader of the Engels City Machine Manufacturing Factory, said, "Heartfelt conversations, timely encouragement, practical help, and fair reproaches - these are the methods of our educational work, and individual contact with young people is the foundation of these methods." ("Young League Members in Enterprises Talk About Their Work")

The League organization must give great concern to the life and welfare problems of young people and mass cultural work. Because if young people do not have comfortable public dormitories and cannot get proper recreational activities, they will not be able to rest well, which will directly affect production. How to solve these problems? The League can discover and cultivate activists in various fields from among League members and non-League youth, let them organize and lead various cultural activities, such as dance groups, choirs, sports teams, outings, going to the theater, watching movies, etc., but the League organization must guide and support his work. The League can organize the youth's own strength to solve problems such as the hygiene around the dormitory, planting trees, planting flowers, and even opening up various small sports fields. Some problems, such as the equipment problems of public dormitories, need to be suggested to the trade union or submitted to the Party and administration for solutions. In addition, in these three books, especially in the book "Strive to Complete the Five-Year Plan in Four Years," it is emphasized that League cadres must often go to public dormitories, have heartfelt talks with young people, understand their requirements, difficulties, and hopes, so as to effectively educate them, and timely solve their difficulties, and meet their reasonable requirements.

Of course, the scope of the League's work in factories and mines is very broad, and the tasks are very complex and arduous. Therefore, every League cadre is required to: (1) Report the situation to the Party at any time and strive for the help of the Party organization and Party comrades. (2) Comprehensively and deeply understand the situation, study the Party's policies, resolutions, and instructions, and understand the production tasks and production situation of the entire enterprise, workshop, and work section, as well as the implementation of socialist competition. (3) Work should have accurate plans and clear priorities, and be good at persevering to the end with the work that has begun. (4) Be sure to unite and cultivate a group of activists around you to assist you in your work. (5) Before each job is carried out, you must explain the significance, goals, and methods of this job to the young people, and there must be no slightest coercion or command. (6) Widely contact the masses, so that all young people can be regularly influenced and educated by the League. (7) Timely summarize and promote advanced experiences, and support the initiatives of young people.

"The Communist Youth League group is the basic link and tool by which the Communist Youth League organization carries out youth work and attracts youth to actively participate in social life." ("Young League Members in Enterprises Talk About Their Work") Therefore, the selection and training of group leaders is a very important issue. The main criteria for selecting group leaders should be: "To be a good producer yourself, to influence young people with your own exemplary role, and at the same time to be interested in social work and be able to lead young people and organize them." ("The Work of a Communist Youth League Branch in a Workshop") But these people often do not have experience in League work, therefore, the factory League secretary, especially the workshop League secretary, must often talk to them, check their work, and practically help them. Hold "classroom discussions" for League group leaders, that is, regularly or irregularly, according to the actual difficulties in the work of the group leaders, organize people to give them thematic reports, and let them discuss in connection with their own work and exchange experiences. The experiences introduced in these three books are all worth studying and researching by League cadres in our country's factories and mines. However, in practical application, it must be appropriately applied under the leadership of the Party, according to the actual situation of the factory and workshop. It is difficult to achieve good results by mechanically applying the experiences of others regardless of time, place, and conditions.

    我们祖国大规模的经济建设已经开始了，努力学习技术已经成为广大青年工人的迫切要求。因此，如何解决青年工人的技术学习问题，及如何更好地加强团员和广大青年工人的政治思想教育等严重的任务，已经摆在各厂矿、基本建设和运输业中团组织的面前。“争取四年内完成五年计划”、“车间团组织的工作”和“企业中团小组长漫谈自己的工作”，这三本书，是苏联一些优秀的工厂团委书记、车间团委书记和团小组长们，介绍他们自己的成功经验的。无疑，如果我们很好地学习这些先进经验，将会对我们厂矿企业中团的工作有很大的帮助。
    斯大林同志说，竞赛是从事社会主义建设的共产主义方法。我们知道，在各厂矿企业中，青年工人占全体工人很大的数量；因此，动员全体青年工人积极参加社会主义竞赛，就成为厂矿企业中团组织的严重政治任务。但是，如何才能完成这一光荣任务呢？书中告诉我们，首先，必须对一切形式主义作无情的斗争，一定要做好深刻的思想动员工作，务使每一个青年都懂得：开展社会主义竞赛，将会给祖国、全体人民以及他自己带来什么好处；如果自己劳动得不好，则将会给自己的车间、工厂以至整个国家造成什么样的损失，从而加强自己的责任感。同时，还要在工长和生产队长的协助下，帮助每个青年正确地订出自己的社会主义竞赛计划或保证条件。当竞赛开始之后，在整个竞赛过程中，团要对青年的竞赛的活动，组织经常不断的检查，并及时进行总结，推广先进经验，表扬优秀的生产者，带动落后的人。对任何妨碍开展竞赛的现象，定要通过各种各样的形式及时地予以揭发，开展批评与自我批评，而绝不能与之妥协。
    要胜利地开展社会主义竞赛，就一定要不断地提高青年的技术熟练程度。书中也给我们指出了解决这个问题的具体办法。一、按照各个不同的工种，组织各种技术学习小组。二、成立“斯塔哈诺夫学校”，即组织一批青年工人，由本厂、本车间的斯塔哈诺夫工作者担任教员，用不脱离生产的办法，将其先进生产方法表演给他们看，并在一定时间内实地帮助他们掌握这些先进的生产方法。三、组织青年与斯塔哈诺夫工作者会见，即由斯塔哈诺夫工作者向青年报告自己的先进经验，或作实地表演。四、组织基干工人、老工人，在生产过程中经常地辅助青年掌握生产技术。五、通过报纸、墙报等，广泛地向青年介绍斯塔哈诺夫工作者的先进经验。以上几种办法和形式，可以同时运用，交错进行。但事先一定要向全体青年进行教育，激发他们学习技术的要求，并确切地了解每一个人的知识水平和思想情况。
    团的一切活动必须与思想政治教育工作结合起来。进行这一工作的方法和形式是很多的，主要的有以下几种：一、组织各种政治学习小组。二、组织各种各样的报告和讲演。三、组织青年阅读各种书籍，特别是文艺作品。因为“书籍教训青年们要深思熟虑地对待生活，要关心同志们。青年们看到，最有价值的人，就是那些不畏艰难、有高尚的生活目的、克服一切困难去达到这个目标的人。书籍也教会了许多人具有坚忍不拔的精神，帮助他们克服了一些初期的困难。书籍还教人学会一件事：为祖国、为苏维埃人民而自豪。而这种感情，也就鼓舞人去自觉地忘我地工作。”（“争取四年内完成五年计划”）四、根据青年的要求，请老工人或其他人，讲述自己亲身经历过的革命故事。五、举行公开的团员大会（即吸收广大青年参加），把当前生产、学习中的重大问题或团员、青年破坏劳动纪律的行为等等，提到大会来让大家讨论。六、向团员、非团青年传达党和上级团委的决议、指示，组织他们进行讨论。七、通过个别谈话的方式，深入地了解和切实地教育每一个人。这一点非常重要，尤其是团小组长应广泛运用这一方式。正如恩格斯市机器制造厂团小组长沃罗恩科夫所说的，“倾心的谈话，及时的鼓励，实际的帮助，公正的责备——这就是我们的教育工作的方法，个别接触青年是这些方法的基础。”（“企业中团小组长漫谈自己的工作”）
    对青年的生活福利问题和群众文化工作，团的组织一定要给以极大的关心。因为青年如果没有舒适的公共宿舍，得不到适当的文娱生活的调剂，就不可能休息得好，就要直接影响生产。怎样解决这些问题呢？团可以从团员与非团青年中发现和培养各方面的积极分子，让他们去组织并领导各种文艺活动，如舞蹈组、合唱队、球队、郊游、看戏、看电影等等，但团组织一定要对他的工作加以指导和支持。宿舍周围的卫生、植树、栽花以至开辟各种小型运动场等等，团可以组织青年自己的力量来解决。有些问题，如公共宿舍的设备问题，则需要建议工会或提请党和行政上设法解决。此外，在这三本书中，特别是在“争取四年内完成五年计划”一书中，都强调指出：团的干部一定要经常到公共宿舍中去，和青年作倾心的恳谈，了解他们的要求、困难和希望，以便切实有效地教育他们，及时解决他们的困难，满足他们的合理要求。
    当然，厂矿企业团的工作范围是很广泛的，任务也是很复杂而艰巨的。因此，就要求每一个团的干部：（一）随时向党反映情况，争取党的组织、党员同志的帮助。（二）全面而深刻地了解情况，学习党的政策、决议和指示，了解整个企业、车间、工段的生产任务和生产情况，以及社会主义竞赛的执行情况等等。（三）工作要有准确的计划和明确的重点，并要善于把开始了的工作坚持到底。（四）一定要在自己的周围团结和培养一批积极分子，协助自己进行工作。（五）每件工作进行之前，必须向青年们阐明这件工作的意义、目标和方法，不得有丝毫的强迫命令。（六）广泛联系群众，要使所有的青年都能经常受到团的影响和教育。（七）及时总结与推广先进经验，支持青年的倡议。
        “青年团小组，是青年团组织借以进行青年工作、吸引青年积极参加社会生活的基本环节和工具。”“（企业中团小组长漫谈自己的工作”）因此，小组长的选择与培养是非常重要的问题。选择小组长的主要标准应该是：“要自己是个好的生产者，以个人的模范作用来影响青年，同时还要对社会工作有兴趣，能够带动青年，把他们组织起来。”（“车间团组织的工作”）但这些人往往没有团的工作经验，因此，工厂团委书记，特别是车间团委书记，要常和他们谈话，检查他们的工作，实际地帮助他们。举办团小组长的“课堂讨论”，即定期或不定期的，根据小组长工作中的实际困难问题，组织人向他们作专题报告，并让他们联系自己的工作进行讨论，交流经验。这三本书中所介绍的经验，都是值得我国厂矿企业中团的干部很好学习研究的。但在实际运用时，一定要在党的领导下，根据本厂、本车间的实际情况，适当运用。不分时间、场合和条件，机械地搬用他人的经验，是难以收到好的效果的。
