Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Soviet workers and agricultural laborers across the country continue to respond to the call of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union, actively engaging in production and construction, and commemorating their beloved leader and teacher, Joseph Stalin, with heroic labor.

    In the Donbass region, miners at the Stalin mine of the Voroshilov Coal Industry Trust pledged to increase this year's over-production of coal from 10,000 tons to 15,000 tons. In the first twelve days of March, they had already over-produced by 1,050 tons. Everyone in the mine exceeded their quotas. Coal combine operator Mironov, coal cutter operator Minayev, coal hewer Chumak, and Pavlov regularly completed two to two and a half quotas. Advanced coal hewer Le. Valeinikov has completed six annual quotas since the start of the new Five-Year Plan and may complete another eight before the end of the Five-Year Plan. In the dozens of enterprises manufacturing orders for Stalin's communist construction projects, thousands upon thousands of workers are working with great enthusiasm. At the Stalin Machine Manufacturing Plant in New Kramatorsk, the personnel of the mechanical department, after completing two spindles for hydroelectric turbines ahead of schedule, are striving to complete a large number of parts for the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station turbines ahead of schedule. A machine manufacturing plant in Slavyansk completed its orders for the first quarter of this year for the Kuibyshev-Gitteloucha Railway a few days ago. Workers at the Azov Iron and Steel Works also transported a large number of sheet pile to the Turkmen Main Canal construction site a few days ahead of schedule. The team of An. Degtyarev in the blast furnace workshop is excellently fulfilling the guarantees they made at the Stalin memorial meeting. On the 11th, they over-produced by about 100 tons of pig iron above the quota.

    In Magnitogorsk, workers in the No. 1 open-hearth furnace workshop of the Stalin Iron and Steel Works have smelted thousands of tons of steel above plan since the beginning of March. Renowned steelworkers Zinurov, Semenov, and Zakharov specialize in rapid steelmaking, exceeding the prescribed standard by more than 1,300 kilograms of steel production per square meter of furnace bottom area. On the 13th, Zinurov reduced the time required to smelt a furnace of steel by one hour and twenty minutes compared to the regulation. Workers at the Magnitogorsk Rolling Mill also recently completed the first batch of orders for the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station ahead of schedule.

    In Stalingrad, at the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, founded on Stalin's suggestion, the pace of production has become even more compact. On the walls of the huge assembly shop hangs the workers' oath: "Comrade Stalin, we swear to you that we will never leave the path you have pointed out." New achievements are being created one after another. When the Kursakov team on the night shift handed over the shift, the tractors they assembled that night exceeded the plan by 20 percent. The next day, workers on the day shift also exceeded their tasks by 36 percent.

    News of heroic labor continues to pour in from other parts of the country. At the Minsk Automobile Factory, all the employees of the truck department exceeded their quotas on the 13th, and many trucks were delivered to Stalingrad and Kuibyshev ahead of schedule. Oil workers in Azerbaijan have also achieved brilliant results in heroic labor. The team of the famous driller Babayev is drilling wells using rapid methods and has drilled 700 meters above plan.

    Spring plowing is being carried out on a large scale in eleven Soviet republics, including the Russian Federation and Belarus, and the southern regions of Moldova and Ukraine. In many regions of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and the North Caucasus, wheat, barley, and feed crops have been sown in a short period of time. In Central Asia and Transcaucasia, more than 500,000 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) of land had been sown by March 10. Collective farmers everywhere are actively sowing seeds or carefully preparing seeds and fertilizers.

    The work of inspecting machines and farm implements at machine tractor stations is coming to an end. Each tractor team has accepted specific tasks for the entire spring season, and tractor drivers are determined to do a good job in spring plowing. A high degree of mechanization is a salient feature of this year's spring plowing. The degree of mechanization of this year's spring sowing work will reach 86 percent. In addition, the Soviet people are widely using airplanes for agricultural work. A large number of airplanes are spreading fertilizers from the air and spraying insecticides and herbicides on the fields. (Attached picture)

    苏联工人以英勇劳动纪念斯大林
    据新华社讯：苏联全国各地工人和农业劳动者继续响应苏联共产党和政府的号召，积极从事生产建设，以英勇的劳动来纪念亲爱的领袖和导师约·维·斯大林。
    在顿巴斯，伏罗希洛夫煤业托辣斯的斯大林矿场的矿工，保证把今年超过计划多生产的煤从一万吨提高到一万五千吨。在三月份头十二天里，他们已超过计划多开采了一千零五十吨煤。全矿场的每一个人都超过了自己的定额。采煤联合机操使者米罗诺夫、截煤机操使者米纳耶夫、凿煤工人楚马克和巴夫洛夫经常完成两个到两个半定额。先进凿煤工人列·瓦列伊尼科夫自新五年计划开始以来已完成了六个一年定额，到五年计划结束前，他还可能再完成八个一年定额。在为斯大林共产主义建设工程制造定货的几十个企业中，成千成万的工人都以充沛的热情进行工作。在新克拉马托尔斯克的斯大林机器制造厂，机械部的人员在提前完成了水电站透平用的两个锭子后，正在争取提前完成古比雪夫水电站透平的大批零件。斯拉维扬斯克的一个机器制造厂几天前已提前完成了古比雪夫—吉特洛乌查铁路今年第一季度的订货。亚速钢铁厂的工人也在几天前提前把大批铁皮色的桩子运往土库曼大运河建设工地。该厂高炉车间安·杰格佳列夫小组正在出色地完成着他们在斯大林追悼会上提出的保证。在十一日那天，他们就超过定额多生产了一百吨左右的铣铁。
    在马格尼托哥尔斯克，斯大林钢铁厂第一平炉车间的工人从三月初以来已超过计划多熔炼了成千吨的钢。著名炼钢工人齐努罗夫、谢麦诺夫和扎哈罗夫专门用快速炼钢法炼钢，并使每平方公尺炉底面积的产钢量超过规定标准一千三百多公斤。齐努罗夫在十三日已使炼一炉钢所需的时间比规定短一小时又二十分钟。马格尼托哥尔斯克轧钢厂的工人最近也提前完成了斯大林格勒水电站的第一批定货。
    在斯大林格勒，在斯大林建议下创立的斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂，生产的节奏更加紧凑了，在庞大的装配车间的墙上，挂着工人们的誓言：“斯大林同志，我们向您宣誓，我们永远不离开你所指出的道路。”新的成就接二连三地创造出来。当值夜班的库尔萨科夫小组交班时，他们在夜里装配的拖拉机已超过计划百分之二十。而在第二天，值日班的工人也在工作中超过了他们的任务百分之三十六。
    其他各地也不断传出英勇劳动的消息。在明斯克汽车工厂，载重卡车部的全体职工在十三日都超过了他们的定额，许多卡车都提前送到了斯大林格勒和古比雪夫。阿塞拜疆的石油工人在英勇劳动方面也获得了辉煌成就。著名钻探工人巴巴耶夫的小组正在以快速方法钻井，他们已超过计划多钻了七百公尺。
    春耕工作正在苏联十一个加盟共和国中大规模地进行，其中包括俄罗斯联邦和白俄罗斯，摩尔达维亚和乌克兰南部区域。在乌兹别克、土库曼、塔吉克和北高加索的许多区域，已在短期内播种了小麦、大麦和饲料作物。在中亚细亚和外高加索，到三月十日已有五十多万公顷（一公顷合十五市亩）土地播了种。各地的集体农民正在积极进行播种或细心地准备种子和肥料。
    机器拖拉机站检查机器和农具的工作即将结束。每一个拖拉机队都接受了关于整个春季的具体任务，拖拉机手们决心做好春耕工作。高度的机械化是今年春耕的一个显著特色。今年春季播种工作的机械化程度，将要达到百分之八十六。此外，苏联人民正广泛使用飞机进行农业工作。大量飞机从空中撒下肥料，并把杀虫剂和除草剂洒在田地上。（附图片）
    一九五三年三月九日，当约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林的遗体抬入陵墓的时候，苏联全国各地都为伟大的领袖和导师默哀。这是莫斯科街道上默哀的人们。
