In Shenyang City, from the "Three-Anti" campaign last year to the end of January this year, state-owned commercial companies discovered a total of 168 embezzlers (including embezzlement, theft, extortion, and absconding with funds), who embezzled and stole 882.69 million yuan of state property. Among them, 41 embezzled/stole between 1 million and 10 million yuan, 3 between 10 million and 100 million yuan, and 2 over 100 million yuan. In terms of the positions held by these embezzlers, there were 51 salespersons, 33 purchasing and escort personnel, 19 accountants and cashiers, 20 general affairs and administrators, 15 warehouse keepers, and 30 other personnel (including guards, odd-job workers, and drivers). Regarding the length of time the embezzlers had been working, 111 had started working before the "Three-Anti" campaign, including 32 who committed serious embezzlement crimes; 57 had started working after the "Three-Anti" campaign or had been transferred from other departments, including 21 who were originally clerks in private shops and transferred to state-owned shops after the "Five-Anti" campaign.

Why did these serious embezzlement and theft phenomena continue to occur after the "Three-Anti" movement? The main reason is that some leading cadres in the state-owned commercial system still have a serious bureaucratic work style after the "Three-Anti" movement. They did not earnestly solve the serious problems of "impure organization, low awareness, lax system, and weak leadership" in the state-owned commercial departments that were exposed in the "Three-Anti" movement. The various units did not continue to educate all employees, especially those who had minor embezzlement behavior and were exempted from punishment in the "Three-Anti" movement. The idea that "embezzlement is shameful" has not yet formed public opinion among the masses. Therefore, some people continued to make the mistake of embezzlement after the "Three-Anti" movement.

Secondly, many new employees have been added since the "Three-Anti" movement, but political education has not kept up. Some people were assigned to departments in charge of money and goods, and took the opportunity to embezzle.

Some units did not improve the personnel system after the "Three-Anti" movement, and the idea of some leading cadres valuing talent over morality still existed seriously, which allowed some people with bad character to take advantage of loopholes. Yin Zhongpeng, a salesman at the Shenyang Trust Company's Pharmaceutical Goods Station, was a clerk in a private pharmacy before the "Three-Anti" movement. After the "Three-Anti" movement, he came to work at the Trust Company and was assigned to the Pharmaceutical Goods Station as a salesman. In his work, he was outwardly obedient but inwardly defiant, and flattered others to gain the trust of the leaders. He then colluded with private merchants and embezzled by means of theft, price suppression, and price increases. After his embezzlement was discovered, the company's leaders still thought he was "active" in his work and did not deal with him. Soon after, Yin absconded with 96 million yuan. After being arrested, it was found after investigation that he had embezzled a total of 105 million yuan.

After the "Three-Anti" movement, the business and financial systems of some units were still chaotic, giving embezzlers an opportunity to take advantage. Li Ronghai, a salesman at the No. 5 Store of Shenyang Department Store Company, embezzled by taking advantage of the system of not making reports for selling goods. He believed that "anyway, the goods are managed by everyone, and if they are lost, everyone will compensate." In various stores of the Municipal Department Store Company, loss of goods and shortages of funds have become a common phenomenon (currently, the card collection method has been implemented and has initially overcome this problem). The leading cadres of the Municipal Company did not promptly inspect and deal with this, but only asked the salespeople to write a note. This gave some people with bad character the opportunity to embezzle.

Most of these embezzlement cases were exposed and reported by the broad masses of employees. The various specialized companies have mostly handled the large and small embezzlers who have been exposed and reported by means of mass discussions, giving appropriate treatment according to the severity of the circumstances. Shenyang Department Store Company and the former Municipal Industrial Equipment Company held public trials of embezzlers and thieves to educate the masses, so that the masses could further raise their vigilance and pay attention to exposing embezzlement behavior at all times. However, some units did not fully mobilize the masses to openly discuss the handling of these cases, so that the due educational purpose could not be achieved.

The lessons learned from the discovery of a considerable number of embezzlement cases in the state-owned commercial system of Shenyang City after the "Three-Anti" movement are worthy of attention by all localities. (Wang Jin)

    沈阳市国营商业系统发现严重贪污现象
    沈阳市各国营商业公司从去年“三反”后至今年一月底，共发现贪污分子一百六十八人（包括贪污、盗窃、勒索携款潜逃等），贪污、盗窃国家财产八亿八千二百六十九万元。其中贪污、盗窃百万元至千万元的四十一人，千万元至一亿元的三人，一亿元以上的二人。从这些贪污分子担任的工作职务来看，计营业员五十一人，采购押运员三十三人，会计、出纳员十九人，总务、管理员二十人，保管员十五人，其他人员（包括警卫、勤杂人员、汽车司机等）三十人。从贪污分子参加工作的期限来看，“三反”前参加工作的一百一十一人，其中重犯贪污罪的三十二人；“三反”后参加工作的和从其他部门转来的五十七人，其中原为私营商店店员，在“五反”后转入国营商店者二十一人。
    为什么在“三反”运动后继续产生了这些严重的贪污、盗窃现象呢？主要原因是国营商业系统的某些领导干部，在“三反”运动后仍然存在着严重的官僚主义作风，他们没有把在“三反”运动中暴露出来的国营商业部门“组织不纯、觉悟不高、制度不严、领导不强”等严重问题，认真加以解决。各单位没有对全体职工，特别是对有轻微的贪污行为而在“三反”运动中免予处分的人，继续进行教育，“贪污可耻”的思想还没有在群众中形成舆论，因此，有些人在“三反”后继续犯了贪污的错误。
    其次，“三反”后增加了很多新参加工作的人员，但政治教育跟不上。有的人被分配到管钱、管物的部门，就乘机贪污。
    有些单位在“三反”没有健全人事制度，某些领导干部重才轻德的思想依然严重存在，这就使某些品质恶劣的人钻了空子。原沈阳市信托公司医药货栈营业员尹中鹏，“三反”前在私商药房当店员，“三反”后到信托公司工作，被分配到医药货栈当营业员。他在工作中阳奉阴违、阿谀奉承，骗取了领导干部的信任，就勾结私商，采取盗窃、压价、抬价等方法进行贪污。他的贪污行为被发现后，该公司领导干部还认为他工作“积极”，没有加以处理。不久尹携款九千六百万元潜逃，被逮捕后，经审查，发现他先后贪污一亿零五百万元。
        “三反”运动后，有些单位业务和财务制度依然混乱，使贪污分子有机可乘。沈阳市百货公司第五商店营业员李荣海，利用卖货不做表报的制度进行贪污，他认为：“反正货是大家管理，丢了大家赔”。市百货公司各个商店中，丢货、少款已成为普遍现象（目前由于推行了卡片收款法已初步克服）。市公司领导干部对此也不及时检查、处理，只让售货员写一个条子。这就使部分品质不好的人有了进行贪污的机会。
    这些贪污案件，绝大部分是广大职工检举和揭发出来的。各专业公司对这些已揭发和检举出的大、小贪污分子，大部分已通过群众讨论，分别情节轻重，予以适当地处理。沈阳市百货公司、原市工业器材公司都召开了公审贪污、盗窃分子大会，以教育群众，使群众进一步提高警惕性，时刻注意揭发贪污行为。但有些单位在处理时未充分发动群众公开讨论，以致达不到应有的教育目的。
    沈阳市国营商业系统在“三反”后发现相当多的贪污案件的教训，值得引起各地重视。（王今）
