    The Central Forestry Department issued instructions on forest protection and fire prevention on the 2nd. The instructions pointed out: Since the start of large-scale national construction, the demand for timber has increased significantly. Therefore, the significance of protecting the country's existing forest resources and strictly preventing forest fires is even greater. After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on strictly preventing forest fires in March 1952, most parts of the country launched patriotic forest protection and fire prevention campaigns, resulting in a significant reduction in forest fires. However, in some areas, leading cadres did not pay enough attention to these instructions, forest protection organizations were often perfunctory, and the responsibility system was not well implemented. Forest fires caused by burning land for cultivation and burning wasteland have caused extremely serious damage to forest resources. Therefore, people's governments at all levels and local forestry departments must further strengthen their leadership over forest protection and fire prevention work, widely conduct patriotic forest protection education among the masses, establish and improve forest protection organizations, and formulate patriotic forest protection covenants, so that forest protection and fire prevention become a mass patriotic movement to eliminate fire sources and extinguish fires. The instructions require all localities to do the following:

    1. Continue to earnestly implement the instructions on strictly preventing forest fires issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the Central People's Government on March 4, 1952, clarify rewards and punishments, and strictly implement the system of responsibility at all levels, divided by regions and sections, in order to eliminate fire sources and extinguish fires, and ensure absolute safety in large natural forest areas.

    2. Under the system of responsibility at all levels, it is necessary to vigorously mobilize and organize the masses, combine with the vital interests of the masses, and carry out extensive patriotic propaganda and education work. Any coercive orders and perfunctory phenomena should be corrected. In carrying out forest protection and fire prevention work, all localities should pay attention to cultivating typical examples and models to promote overall progress, and deepen this work to discover problems, study, and improve. When forest protection and fire prevention work comes to an end, working meetings and forest protection model conferences should be convened to summarize and reward, and leadership work should no longer remain at the level of general calls.

    3. Eliminating fire sources is an important aspect of extinguishing fires. According to past experience, burning land for cultivation and burning wasteland, sparks from railway locomotives, the masses burning paper during tomb sweeping, entering the mountains to engage in sideline occupations and warming themselves by fire, baking dry food, smoking, setting fires for hunting, sparks from chimneys in mountain villages, or landlords and bandits and secret agents and other counter-revolutionaries setting fires to sabotage national resources, are all important causes of fires. Among them, the disasters caused by burning land for cultivation and burning wasteland are more common and serious. Therefore, except in the south, where fire burning methods can be used in a planned and organized way to clear forest land for the purpose of tending and renewing or afforestation, provided that fire prevention is guaranteed, and in some pastures in Inner Mongolia, where withered grass can be burned before snow melts in winter, in general forest areas with the habit of burning land for cultivation, it is necessary to widely carry out propaganda and education to local people to change this habit. At the same time, all localities must establish a certain mountain forest management system and strictly control or arrest and bring to justice landlords, bandits and secret agents and other counter-revolutionaries who destroy forests, depending on the circumstances.

    4. All localities should effectively grasp the seasonality of fires. Before the season when fires are likely to occur arrives, all localities should make full preparations and study and analyze the possibility and regularity of mountain fires, and take different measures according to different situations. At the same time, various meetings should be held to deploy and mobilize. During this season, all localities should list forest protection and fire prevention work as one of the central tasks, vigorously lead, strictly supervise and inspect.

    5. In mountain and forest areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, forest destruction in the past has been relatively serious. In the future, these areas must implement the policy towards ethnic minorities, strengthen propaganda and education, raise the awareness of the masses, widely develop sideline production in mountainous areas, strengthen timber purchase work, and help the masses overcome difficulties in life, in order to gradually correct the habits of burning mountains, burning land for cultivation, and indiscriminate reclamation. The experience of Inner Mongolia in organizing Oroqen hunters as forest rangers is very good, and all localities should study and promote it in light of local conditions.

    6. The season when mountain fires are likely to occur is coming soon. In order to ensure forest safety, avoid fires, and strengthen the control and leadership of forest protection and fire prevention work, forestry departments at all levels in important forest areas should, under the unified leadership of local governments, cooperate with people's supervisory organs and public security organs to quickly form forest protection and fire prevention headquarters or offices, whose tasks are to organize, promote, inspect, and supervise local forest protection and fire prevention work, and summarize the experience of forest protection and fire prevention. Forest protection and fire prevention headquarters or offices at all levels should report the situation of forest protection and fire prevention work, especially the fire situation, to the Central Forest Protection and Fire Prevention Office every five days by telephone, telegram, or official document. As for the date and method of reporting from districts and townships (villages) to the county level, it can be decided by each locality according to the specific situation. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 中央林业部发出关于护林防火的指示

    中央林业部发出关于护林防火的指示
    中央人民政府林业部二日发出关于护林防火的指示。指示中指出：国家大规模建设开始后，木材需要量显著增加；因此，保护国家现有森林资源，严防森林火灾的意义就更加重大。一九五二年三月中共中央和中央人民政府政务院发出关于严防森林火灾指示后，全国大部分地区便开展了爱国护林防火运动，因而森林火灾大为减少；但有些地区由于领导干部对于这一指示重视不够，护林组织多流于形式，责任制也没有很好贯彻，烧垦烧荒所引起的森林火灾，对森林资源所造成的损失，仍极严重。为此，各级人民政府和各地的林业部门必须进一步加强对护林防火工作的领导，广泛地对群众展开爱国护林教育，建立并健全护林组织，订立爱国护林公约，使护林防火成为群众性的爱国主义运动，以杜绝火源，扑灭火灾。指示要求各地做好以下几件工作：
    一、继续认真贯彻一九五二年三月四日中共中央和中央人民政府政务院关于严防森林火灾的指示，严明奖惩，并严格执行分区分段按级负责制，以期杜绝火源，扑灭火灾，并做到大面积天然林区的绝对安全。
    二、必须在按级负责的制度下，大力发动群众和组织群众，结合群众的切身利益，展开广泛的爱国主义宣传教育工作。任何强迫命令和流于形式的现象，都应加以纠正。各地在开展护林防火工作中，要注意培养典型，培养模范，推动全面，并要把这
    一工作深入一步，发现问题，研究改进。护林防火工作告一段落时，要召集工作会议和护林模范大会，进行总结和奖励，领导工作不应再停留在一般号召上。
    三、杜绝火源，是扑灭火灾的重要环节。根据过去的经验，烧垦烧荒，火车机车喷火，群众上坟烧纸，入山搞副业烤火，烤干粮，吃烟，放火打猎，山村烟囱跑火，或恶霸地主和土匪特务等反革命分子放火破坏国家资源等，都是发生火灾的重要根源，其中尤以烧垦烧荒所造成的灾害更为普遍而严重。因此，除在南方为了抚育更新或造林，在保证不发生火灾的原则下，可有计划、有组织地用火烧办法清理林地；在内蒙古某些牧场可在冬季融雪前进行烧毁枯草而外，在一般有烧垦习惯的林区，必须向当地群众广泛进行宣传教育，改变这种烧垦积习。同时各地必须建立一定的山林管理制度，并对破坏森林的恶霸地主和土匪特务等反革命分子分别情况予以严密管制或逮捕法办。
    四、各地应切实掌握发生火灾的季节性。在易于发生火灾的季节到来以前，各地应作充分预防和准备，并对发生山火的可能性和规律性作充分的研究和分析，根据不同情况，作不同的措施；同时，应召开各种会议进行布置和动员。在这一季节，各地均应把护林防火工作列为中心任务之一，大力领导，严加督促和检查。
    五、少数民族居住的山林地区，过去森林破坏较为严重。今后这些地区必须贯彻民族政策，加强宣传教育工作，提高群众觉悟，广泛开展山区副业生产；加强木材收购工作，帮助群众克服生活困难，以逐步纠正烧山、烧垦和滥垦的习惯。内蒙古组织鄂伦春猎户为护林员的经验甚好，各地应结合当地具体情况，加以研究推广。
    六、目前容易发生山火的季节即将来临，为确保森林安全，避免火灾，加强对护林防火工作的掌握和领导，各重要林区地带的各级林业部门应在当地政府的统一领导下，配合人民监察机关和公安机关，迅速组成护林防火指挥部或办公室，其任务为组织、推动、检查和督促当地护林防火工作，并总结护林防火的经验。各级护林防火指挥部或办公室应按级将护林防火工作情况，特别是火灾情况，每五天用电话、电报或公文向中央护林防火办公室层报一次。至于区、乡（村）向县层报日期和办法，可由各地根据具体情况决定。    （新华社）
