    Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: American imperialism's recent series of activities to reassemble a Middle East aggression bloc has met with another shameful failure amid fierce opposition from the people of Middle Eastern and Near Eastern countries. This shows that the United States still faces heavy obstacles in piecing together a Middle East aggression group.
    The U.S.'s Middle East aggression bloc plan was formally proposed in October 1951 in the name of the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey. Due to the widespread opposition of the people of the Middle Eastern countries, this aggression plan quickly failed. However, the US government has not learned from this failure and has recently attempted to use another set of means, that is, through its most loyal lackey in the Middle East, the Turkish ruling clique, to re-engage Arab and Islamic countries to join the "Middle East Command."
    Turkey first wanted to pull its neighbor Iran into the aggression bloc. In order to achieve this goal, the Turkish government pretended to be "friendly" with Iran, established the "Turkish-Iranian Friendship Association," and appointed Turkish Foreign Minister Koprulu as its president. At the same time, the United States also directly used the British-Iranian oil dispute to threaten and lure Iran into joining the Middle East aggression group. However, the Iranian people quickly saw through the new conspiracy of the American imperialists and expressed their opposition. "Bisoo Ayandeh" said: The Iranian people firmly oppose participating in the "Middle East Defense Pact" because this pact is "a trap set by American and British imperialists to prolong the period of enslavement of the people of the Middle East, Near East, and North Africa."
    The Turkish ruling clique is also trying its best to win over another Islamic country, Pakistan, to join the aggression bloc. Under the instructions of the US government, Turkey is constantly intensifying its diplomatic activities with Pakistan. At the end of January this year, the United States also sent its commander of the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Navy, Wright, to "visit" Pakistan. This blatant action by the United States aroused the anger and opposition of the broad masses of the Pakistani people. Pakistani public opinion, various people's organizations, and many political parties have issued statements condemning the new conspiracy of the United States.
    The Turkish reactionaries have also recently attempted to win over Arab countries and Turkey to establish a so-called "Arab-Turkish Alliance" as the first step in pulling these countries into the Middle East aggression group. In February, Turkish Foreign Minister Koprulu, in a conversation with a delegation of Lebanese journalists in Ankara, openly demanded that "the military efforts of Arab countries and Turkey be united with the assistance of the United States, Britain, and France." This plan of the Turkish reactionaries to act as accomplices aroused indignation among the Arab countries. The Arab people still clearly remember the barbaric oppressive policies of the Turkish rulers during the Ottoman Empire towards the Arab people of the Middle East. The Lebanese "Telegraph" said: Turkey's proposal "hides a major conspiracy behind it." The Syrian "Liwa" newspaper pointed out: "No rational person would agree to Turkey's proposal."
        Amidst the fierce opposition of the people of the Middle East and Near East, the Turkish ruling clique finally had to end this new conspiracy of the United States by "categorically denying" the news that Koprulu had ever made such a proposal.

### 美国重新拼凑中东侵略集团阴谋又遭失败

    美国重新拼凑中东侵略集团阴谋又遭失败
    【新华社二十日讯】美帝国主义最近为重新拼凑中东侵略集团而进行的一连串活动，在中东、近东各国人民激烈的反对下，又遭到可耻的失败。这表明美国要拼凑中东侵略集团仍然困难重重。
    美国的中东侵略集团计划是在一九五一年十月间以美国、英国、法国、土耳其四国名义正式提出的。由于中东各国人民的普遍反对，这一侵略计划很快就宣告流产。但美国政府并没有从这个失败中取得教训，最近更企图用另一套手段，即通过它在中东最忠实的走狗土耳其统治集团，重新进行拉拢阿拉伯及回教国家加入“中东司令部”。
    土耳其首先想把它的邻国伊朗拉进侵略集团。为了达到这个目的，土耳其政府装出和伊朗“亲善”的姿态，成立了“土伊友好协会”，并由土耳其外交部长柯普路鲁担任会长。同时，美国也直接利用英伊石油纠纷，进行威胁利诱，以图使伊朗政府加入中东侵略集团。但是伊朗人民很快就看出了美帝国主义者的新阴谋，纷纷表示反对。“比苏·阿杨第报”说：伊朗人民坚决反对参加“中东防御公约”，因为这个公约是“美英帝国主义者为了延长奴役中东、近东和北非各国人民的时期而设置的一个陷阱”。
    土耳其统治集团同时竭力拉拢另一回教国家巴基斯坦加入侵略集团，在美国政府指使下，土耳其不断加紧它和巴基斯坦之间的外交活动。今年一月底，美国还派了它的东大西洋及地中海海军司令赖特到巴基斯坦“访问”。美国的这种明目张胆的行动激起了巴基斯坦广大人民的愤怒反对。巴基斯坦的舆论、各人民团体及许多政党都发表了声明，斥责美国的新阴谋。
    土耳其反动派最近还企图拉拢阿拉伯国家和土耳其成立所谓“阿拉伯—土耳其联盟”，作为把这些国家拉入中东侵略集团的第一步。二月间，土耳其外交部长柯普路鲁在安卡拉对黎巴嫩记者代表团谈话时，公开要求“阿拉伯国家和土耳其的军事努力在美、英、法三国协助下联合起来”。土耳其反动派这一为虎作伥的计划使阿拉伯国家群情激愤。阿拉伯人民还很清楚地记得鄂图曼帝国时期土耳其统治者对中东阿拉伯人民的野蛮压迫政策。黎巴嫩
    “电讯报”说：土耳其的建议“背后隐藏着重大的阴谋”。叙利亚“利瓦报”指出：“任何有理性的人都不会同意土耳其的建议。”
        在中东、近东人民激烈的反对下，土耳其统治集团终于不得不以“断然否认”关于柯普路鲁曾经提出这种建议的消息的方式，来结束美国的这次新阴谋。
