Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang—According to a reporter from the Korean Central News Agency: Korean People's Army captured personnel, including Li Jishu, Che Genzhu, and Chen Fengwan, who were formerly coerced by the U.S. side into the Li Syngman puppet army, recently returned to the northern half of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and have further provided many facts that the world still does not know. They expose the crimes of the American aggressors in violating the Geneva Convention, abusing and killing our captured personnel, and forcibly sending them into the Li puppet army under the guise of "release."

Li Jishu and others were imprisoned in Prisoner of War Camp Nos. 61, 62, 63, and 65 on Geoje Island after being captured. In their conversations, they first accused the U.S. side of frequently and cruelly abusing and torturing our captured personnel. Li Jishu was imprisoned in Geoje Island Camp Nos. 61 and 63 from September 30, 1951, to April 29, 1952. He said that the forced labor imposed on prisoners by the U.S. side could be divided into internal operations and external operations. Internal operations referred to tidying up the U.S. military shooting range, carrying stones, and other labor inside and outside the prisoner of war camp; external operations mainly referred to work at the Busan pier, which involved unloading weapons, ammunition, grain, and other military supplies from American ships arriving at the Busan pier. When prisoners were forced to carry out this "operation," the U.S. military supervised them with large whips, arbitrarily beating them. On average, one prisoner was killed on the job site every day for no reason. Che Genzhu said: "In the three months that I was imprisoned in Camp No. 62 on Geoje Island alone, I knew of more than one hundred prisoners who were beaten to death." Che Genzhu also angrily pointed out that when our captured personnel rested due to continuous heavy work or hunger, the U.S. military stripped them of their clothes and poured water on them or applied electric currents, using these barbaric means to torture our captured personnel in an attempt to force them to submit to the will of the American aggressors.

Che Genzhu revealed that the U.S. side had dispatched a large number of special agents under the name of "CMP" camp guards to each camp in the Geoje Island prisoner of war camp. Most of these special agents were Li puppet army officers. They held wooden sticks and organized "Greater Korean Youth Association," "Exterminate Communists and Save the Nation Association," and "Anti-Communist Dare-to-Die Assembly" in the prisoner of war camp, using all kinds of coercive means to force our captured personnel to join. The number of these dispatched special agents increased day by day. According to Che Genzhu, when he was escorted to Camp No. 65 on Geoje Island, there were only 90 "CMP" personnel in the prisoner of war camp, but later it increased to 300. The main task of the second section of the "CMP" team was to monitor the actions of our captured personnel; the third section was in charge of so-called "security." The "CMP," under the instructions of the U.S. military, brutally persecuted our captured personnel.

Che Genzhu further revealed the U.S. military's crime of massacring our captured personnel on a large scale on August 15, 1951. The full details of this bloody massacre are still unknown to the world. He said that at that time, our People's Army captured personnel in Camps Nos. 61 to 65 were celebrating the day when their homeland was liberated. However, the U.S. military guards used machine guns to carry out intensive sweeping fire against us. This massacre continued until August 17. More than 40 people were killed and more than 70 were injured in Camp No. 65. This was the prisoner of war camp with the fewest casualties among several camps. In Camp No. 63, the enemy sent armored vehicles to rush in and threw grenades inside, and finally sent armed forces to rush in. Therefore, in this camp, it took three days to transport our captured personnel who were killed or injured. In this massacre, the number of our captured personnel who were killed reached one thousand, and the number of injured was incalculable. More than 500 people died after being dragged to the hospital due to injuries. The enemy dug many pits about six kilometers away from the prisoner of war camp to bury the corpses of our captured personnel who were killed by them.

Che Genzhu then revealed the truth about the U.S. side's so-called "voluntary repatriation" and "screening." He said that the enemy conducted so-called "North-South reviews" of our captured personnel. The method of review was to ask two questions: "Do you want to stay in South Korea? Or do you want to return to North Korea?" If the prisoner said he wanted to return to North Korea, then the enemy would make a note in English on the prisoner's card. Outside the screening office's tent, "CMP" special agents were waiting with wooden sticks. As soon as they saw that the prisoner's card coming out of the review had a note saying that he wanted to return to North Korea, they would beat him severely until the prisoner was lying there unable to get up.

The American aggressors not only brutally massacred and attempted to detain our captured personnel, but also used the pretense of "releasing civilians" to forcibly send our captured personnel into the Li puppet army to serve as cannon fodder for the United States in its aggression. At least 38,000 of our captured personnel were illegally "released" by them. Li Jishu, Che Genzhu, Chen Fengwan, and others were also "released" by the enemy from Geoje Island and then forcibly sent into the Li puppet army. According to Chen Fengwan, the enemy transferred them to the Yeongcheon prisoner of war camp in late June 1952. On June 29, a U.S. Army major and an American pastor came to the prisoner of war camp and said to them: "From July 1, you will be 'released' as civilians, and you must work hard for the 'Republic of Korea' after you go back!" An personnel section chief of the puppet Seoul Military District also ordered them to register as "Second National Soldiers" after arriving in various parts of the southern half of Korea and participate in the "Exterminate Communists Front." Chen Fengwan, Li Jishu, Che Genzhu, and tens of thousands of our captured personnel were forcibly incorporated into the Li Syngman puppet army under the various arrangements and strict control of the U.S. and Li bandits.

    曾被美方强迫编入李伪军的我方被俘人员
    进一步揭露美方虐杀我方被俘人员的罪行
    【新华社平壤讯】据朝鲜中央通讯社记者报道：曾被美方强迫编入李承晚伪军的朝鲜人民军被俘人员李吉洙、车根洙、陈凤万等，最近回到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国北半部，进一步提供了全世界至今还不知道的许多事实，揭露美国侵略者违反日内瓦公约，虐杀我方被俘人员和以“释放”为名把他们强行送入李伪军的罪行。
    李吉洙等被俘以后曾被分别囚禁在巨济岛战俘营第六十一、六十二、六十三和六十五号营场。他们在谈话中首先控诉美方经常残酷地虐待和折磨我方被俘人员的情况。李吉洙被俘后在一九五一年九月三十日到一九五二年四月二十九日期间曾被先后囚禁在巨济岛第六十一号和六十三号营场。他说，美方加于俘虏头上的强迫劳动可分为内部作业和外部作业两种。内部作业指的是整理美军射击场、搬运石头等俘虏营内外的劳动；外部作业主要指的是釜山码头作业，就是从来到釜山码头的美国船舶中把武器、弹药、粮食及其他军需品卸下来。在战俘们被迫进行这种“作业”时，美军拿着大马鞭在旁边进行监督，任意殴打他们。每天平均有一个俘虏在作业现场被无端打死。车根洙说：“仅我被关在巨济岛六十二号营场的三个月中，我所知道的就有一百多个战俘被打死。”车根洙并愤怒地指出，当我方被俘人员因不停歇地干重活或由于饥饿而歇一下时，美军就把他们的衣服脱光往上浇水或通以电流，用这种野蛮的手段来折磨我方被俘人员，企图迫使他们屈从美国侵略者的意志。
    车根洙揭露说，美方在巨济岛战俘营的各个营场都派有大批以“CMP”营场警备队为名的特务，这些特务大部分是李伪军的士官。他们手执木棒，在俘虏营内组织“大韩青年会”、“灭共救国会”、“防共决死大会”等，用尽一切胁迫的手段来迫使我方被俘人员加入。这些被派来的特务的人数一天比一天增加。据车根洙说，他被押到巨济岛第六十五号营场时，该俘虏营只有“CMP”九十人，以后增加到三百人，“CMP”队的二科主要的任务是监视我方被俘人员的行动；三科担任所谓“警备”，“CMP”在美军的指示下，残暴地迫害我方被俘人员。
    车根洙进一步揭露了美军在一九五一年八月十五日大规模屠杀我方被俘人员的罪行。这个血腥的屠杀事件的全部情形，直到现在世界上还不知道。他说，当时，我们人民军被俘人员在第六十一号到六十五号营场里庆祝自己祖国获得解放的日子。然而美军警备队们却用机枪向我们施行密集扫射。这次屠杀一直继续到八月十七日。第六十五号营场里被打死的有四十多人，打伤的有七十多人。这还是几个营场中牺牲最少的一个俘虏营。在第六十三号营场，敌人派装甲车冲进去，向里面投手榴弹，最后派武装部队冲进去。因而在这个营场里，搬运被杀伤的我方被俘人员就搬运了三天。在这次屠杀事件中，被打死的我方被俘人员数达一千人，受伤的人无法计算，因受伤被拖到医院后死亡的就在五百人以上。敌人在离俘虏营约六公里的地方挖了许多坑，来掩埋被他们杀害的我方被俘人员的尸体。
    车根洙继而揭露了美方的所谓“自愿遣返”和 “甄别”的真相。他说，敌人对我方被俘人员进行了所谓“南北审查”。审查的方式就是提出“要留在南朝鲜？还是要回北朝鲜？”的两个质问。如果俘虏说要回北朝鲜，那么，敌人就在俘虏的卡片上用英文作了记号。在审查处的帐幕外面，有“CMP”特务拿着木棒等着。他们一看到受审查后出来的俘虏卡片上记着要回北朝鲜的记号时，就加以毒打，一直打得俘虏躺在那里起不来时为止。
    美国侵略者不但残暴地屠杀和企图扣留我方被俘人员，而且以“释放平民”为幌子，把我方被俘人员强迫送入李伪军，为美国充当侵略炮灰。被他们非法“释放”的我方被俘人员，至少有三万八千人。李吉洙、车根洙、陈凤万等也都是被敌人从巨济岛“释放”出来，接着又被强制送入李伪军的。据陈凤万说，敌人在一九五二年六月下旬把他们移送到永川战俘营。六月二十九日，一个美军少校和一个美国牧师来到俘虏营对他们说：“从七月一日起，要以平民身份‘释放’你们，你们回去后要为‘大韩民国’努力战斗！”伪汉城军区司令部的一个人事科长并命令他们在到达南半部各地后一律登记为“第二国民兵”，参加“灭共战线”。陈凤万、李吉洙、车根洙以及数以万计的我方被俘人员就是在美李匪帮的种种布置和严密控制下，被强迫编入了李承晚伪军。
