    National Steel Industry's February Production Still Unsatisfactory
    Steel Bureau Instructs All Enterprises to Promptly Mobilize Workers to Discuss Plans
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The national steel industry's production of major products in February, though slightly improved compared to January, still did not fully meet the planned targets. According to statistics from the Steel Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, as of February 28th, pig iron production reached 107.1% of the plan, steel ingot production reached 104% of the plan, and the plans for other major products were not fulfilled. The production plan completion rate of the Central China Steel Company was the worst.
    In February, the phenomenon of production being weak at the beginning and strong at the end was still serious. Taking the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant and Tangshan Steel Plant, which had better plan completion rates, as examples, the output of open-hearth steel ingots in the second half of the month at the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant was 120% of the output in the first half of the month, and the output of steel products in the second half of the month at the Tangshan Steel Plant was 163% of the output in the first half of the month.
    The main reason for not completing the production plan was the poor planning and management work. The operational plans of most factories and mines were mere formalities and did not truly play a role in organizing and guiding production; even those factories and mines with operational plans lacked specific plans for workshops and groups, resulting in considerable blindness in production. Secondly, responsibility accidents still had a significant impact on production. For example, at the Benxi Coal and Iron Company, the hearth of blast furnace No. 1 burned through in mid-February, injuring two workers and affecting the completion of pig iron tasks. The large motor of the rolling mill at the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant had long been found to have problems but was not thoroughly repaired, leading to a forced shutdown after it burned out. In addition, low attendance rates during the Spring Festival, accidental repairs of auxiliary equipment, and interruptions in power supply also affected the completion of the plan.
    In order to ensure the completion of this year's production plan and further improve enterprise management, the Steel Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry instructed its affiliated enterprises to promptly mobilize workers to discuss production plans, establish correct planning ideas, establish and improve operational plans, organize production through operational plans, and discover weak links in production by inspecting the completion of operational plans, and take effective measures to solve them, and overcome the current state of blindness in production.

### 全国钢铁工业二月份生产情况仍然不好  钢铁局指示各企业单位迅速发动职工群众讨论计划

    全国钢铁工业二月份生产情况仍然不好
    钢铁局指示各企业单位迅速发动职工群众讨论计划
    【本报讯】全国钢铁工业二月份主要产品生产情况，虽较一月份略有进步，但仍然没有全部完成计划。据重工业部钢铁局统计，截至二月二十八日止，生铁完成计划百分之一百零七点一，钢锭完成计划百分之一百零四，其余主要产品计划均未完成。华中钢铁公司生产计划完成最差。
    在二月份中，生产方面前松后紧现象仍很严重。以完成计划较好的上海第一钢铁厂与唐山钢厂为例，上海第一钢铁厂平炉钢锭下半月产量为上半月的百分之一百二十，唐山钢厂钢材下半月产量为上半月的百分之一百六十三。
    没有完成生产计划的主要原因是计划管理工作没有做好。大部厂矿作业计划形同虚设，没有真正起到组织生产、指导生产的作用；有作业计划的厂矿也缺乏车间、小组的具体计划，因此生产中还有很大的盲目性。其次，责任事故对于生产的影响还很严重。如本溪煤铁公司一号高炉二月中烧穿炉缸，两个工人受了伤，并影响生铁任务的完成。上海第三钢铁厂轧钢机的大马达，早就发现有毛病，一直未彻底检修，以致烧坏后被迫停工。另外因春节出勤率低、附属设备的意外检修和电力供应中断，也影响了计划不能完成。
    为了保证完成今年的生产计划，进一步改善企业管理，重工业部钢铁局指示所属企业单位迅速发动职工群众讨论生产计划，树立正确的计划思想，建立与健全作业计划，用作业计划把生产组织起来，并通过检查作业计划的完成情况，发现生产中的薄弱环节，采取有效措施予以解决，克服目前生产中的盲目状态。
