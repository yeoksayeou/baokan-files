Information about the Volunteer Army Spreads Across the Vast Motherland Again
Gu Ping

People returning from the Korean front arrived in the Miao Autonomous Region of Lushan County, Guizhou Province, and the exciting news spread immediately.

"Our Miao representative, Wu Tongming, went to the Korean front to慰问 (wèiwèn - express sympathy and solicitude to; console; salute) the Volunteer Army and has returned to give a report. Have you heard his message?"

"The Volunteer Army's great victory at Shangganling was truly magnificent!"

"Yi Caixue, Qiu Shaoyun, and Huang Jiguang are truly great heroes."

Grandma Tian, a 104-year-old Miao woman, felt anxious because she had not personally heard the report from the delegation representative. She listened quietly as her children and grandchildren told her about the heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army, the American devils' conspiracy to expand the war, and Chairman Mao's call to continue strengthening the work of resisting America and aiding Korea. She instructed her grandchildren to quickly write a letter of慰问 (wèiwèn - express sympathy and solicitude to; console; salute) to the Volunteer Army. She also asked her fifth daughter-in-law to bring out a pair of embroidered sock bottoms she had prepared for the Volunteer Army but had not yet finished. With trembling hands, she picked up her needle and thread and continued to embroider stitch by stitch.

Following the songs of her granddaughters-in-law, the centenarian grandma couldn't help but sing:

“Thousands of hills and ridges, ah,
The Miao people and the Volunteer Army are of one heart;
On the hillside, ah, red flowers bloom,
The Volunteer Army fights for the Miao people.
Red thread, embroidering red flowers,
To the good children at the front;
Volunteer Army, wear them,
Rush through Shangganling,
Beat the American devils until their heads crack open.
Red thread, embroidering red flowers,
Chairman Mao came to love the Miao people.
The Miao people, ah, have changed.
No longer,
‘When the wind comes, the wind sweeps the floor,
When heaven comes, heaven lights the lamp.’
In the past, I lived a hundred years like a nonentity,
Now that I'm a hundred years old, I still want to sing.
‘Dabang’ (thank you), Chairman Mao,
Your kindness, ah, is like mountains and rivers!
‘Dabang’ (thank you), Volunteer Army,
Protecting my hundred-year-old head so I can enjoy peace.”

The representatives of the various sub-delegations of the Second Delegation to Korea, since returning to China last November, have once again widely reported the heroic deeds from the Korean front to people from all walks of life and ethnic groups throughout the country. The people's love for the Volunteer Army has once again been沸腾 (fèiténg - boiling; ebullition) in every corner, and they have expressed it in various ways.

From the snow-covered banks of the Songhua River to the lychee-fragrant Hainan Island, from the vast East China Sea coast to the majestic Yumen Pass, thousands upon thousands of people in every major city and key city and county flocked to welcome the delegation representatives,争抢 (zhēngqiǎng - scramble for; compete for) to hear their reports. Tibetan brothers on the Kangzang Plateau rode horses for four or five days to Changdu to welcome the representatives. People cheered and eagerly demanded: "Please tell us everything the Volunteer Army told you! We will do whatever they ask of us."

According to statistics from the four sub-delegations, the representatives gave more than 3,200 reports in the four administrative regions of East China, Southwest China, North China, and Northeast China, with a direct audience of 6.25 million people. Countless others listened to the representatives' broadcasts; many visited the exhibitions of pictures brought back by the representatives. The cultural troupes and film and slide show teams of each sub-delegation also performed wonderful programs brought back from the front while carrying out their work of传达 (chuándá - transmit; convey; communicate) in various places. In the Southwest and North China regions alone, the audience reached over one million people.

At the same time, these millions of people became the传达者 (chuándá zhě - transmitter; communicator) of the reports. They brought the voice of the慰问 (wèiwèn - express sympathy and solicitude to; console; salute) delegation, this voice from Korea, from the Volunteer Army, to the workshops of countless factories, to the farmers'炕头会 (kàngtóuhuì - informal meetings held on a heated brick bed [kàng]), to the classrooms of elementary schools, to the牧篷 (mù péng - herdsmen's tents) on the grasslands, and to every corner of the vast motherland.

The传达 (chuándá - transmit; convey; communicate) reports of the delegation representatives once again aroused a high tide of patriotic enthusiasm among the broad masses of the people, promoted the large-scale construction of the motherland, and promoted the work of supporting the front and giving preferential treatment to military families.

In the Yumen Oil Mine on the northwestern plateau of the motherland, the workers worked through the night in the冰霜凛冽 (bīngshuāng lǐnliè - severe frost) open air, completing the new oil wells ahead of schedule and using the newly extracted oil to welcome the慰问 (wèiwèn - express sympathy and solicitude to; console; salute) delegation and support the Volunteer Army. They wrote the over-fulfillment of January's production任务 (rènwù - task; mission; assignment) in their patriotic pledge as a gift. In the four days that the慰问 (wèiwèn - express sympathy and solicitude to; console; salute) delegation visited, they proposed 110 reasonable suggestions. They pledged to the Volunteer Army: to develop the rich resources of the motherland, accelerate the industrialization of the motherland, and resolutely complete the motherland's first large-scale five-year construction plan. Such pledges were also made in countless workshops and mines throughout the country.

In the joyful countryside of Pinding County, Shanxi Province, the peasants told their envoys with激动的 (jīdòng de - exciting; stirring) voices: "Please tell Commander Peng Dehuai and all the Volunteer Army comrades that they want people to give people, money to give money, and grain to give grain. We guarantee to resist America and aid Korea to the end." This is also the oath and action of hundreds of millions of peasants standing on the patriotic and丰产 (fēngchǎn - bumper harvest) front.

On the motherland's defense line, the People's Liberation Army soldiers, who vigilantly and钢铁似地 (gāngtiě sì de - like steel) safeguard the motherland's sky and sea and the motherland's border defenses, are integrating the fighting spirit of the Volunteer Army into their regularization and modernization of army building. The soldiers guarding the east coast sang a快板 (kuàibǎn - clapper talk) song: "The Volunteer Army protects the country, modernizing their battle, new weapons in hand, jet planes turning in the sky, cannons and anti-aircraft guns are威风 (wēifēng - imposing; awe-inspiring; dignified), scaring the enemy. Modernized operations are top-notch, and we must master them too. Comrades, work hard, learn from the Volunteer Army, and protect our new country."

From the magnificent universities in Beijing to the nomadic schools on the Inner Mongolia grassland, the voice of the Volunteer Army has become a source of strength to encourage the students of the motherland to "strengthen their bodies and study hard." They named their classes and groups after the heroic names of Qiu Shaoyun and Huang Jiguang, and they studied their lessons with the fighting spirit of the Volunteer Army. Tsinghua University launched a campaign to learn from the Volunteer Army, and the students of Class 15 of Kunming No. 1 Middle School proposed: "Aim for 70 points in each subject and attack 80 points."

In Hangzhou, the representatives of the慰问 (wèiwèn - express sympathy and solicitude to; console; salute) delegation, with the respect of the people of the whole country and the soldiers on the Korean front, presented a glorious international gift – a ring from Jin Zhenxian, the glorious mother of a Korean People's Army soldier in the Korean hero city of Wonsan, to Tang Laotaitai, the glorious mother of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, thanking her for dedicating her eight heroic sons and daughters to the cause of peace. The representatives of the慰问 (wèiwèn - express sympathy and solicitude to; console; salute) delegation expressed their慰问 (wèiwèn - express sympathy and solicitude to; console; salute) to the families of martyrs Huang Jiguang, Liu Xingwen, and Yi Caixue, and told the people of the heroes' hometowns about their deeds in detail. Countless mothers and wives felt honored and proud of their outstanding children and heroic husbands. Countless people regarded the parents of the Volunteer Army as their own parents. Zhang Chengbao, a farmer from Chaoyang Village, Taigu County, sent a message to the Volunteer Army: "I have now made a plan for代耕 (dàigēng - till land on behalf of others, usually for soldiers’ families) work and will lead the mutual aid group to hoe the military dependents' land at least four times to ensure that military dependents increase production and do not have any difficulties." Baoji City also held a "Support the Army and Give Preferential Treatment to Military Families Movement Month."

The motherland's greater support to the front line in the first year of large-scale construction, coupled with the increasingly strong steel-like front line, will make any new threats and blackmail from the enemy seem even more ridiculous, and will make any new adventures of the enemy fail even more miserably.

### 志愿军的信息再一次传遍了辽阔的祖国

    志愿军的信息再一次传遍了辽阔的祖国
    古萍
    从朝鲜前线回来的人，回到了贵州省炉山县的苗族自治区，兴奋的消息马上传开了。
    “我们苗族代表吴通明到朝鲜前线慰问了志愿军，回来作过报告了。你听到过他的传达吗？”
    “志愿军在上甘岭的大胜仗真打得漂亮！”
    “易才学、邱少云、黄继光真是好英雄。”
    田老太太——一百零四岁的苗族老妈妈，没有亲自听到慰问团代表的报告，感到很焦急。她静静地听着儿孙们讲志愿军的英勇事迹，讲美国鬼子扩大战争的阴谋，讲毛主席号召继续加强抗美援朝工作的指示。她吩咐孙儿们赶快向志愿军写慰问信。又叫五儿媳把她准备送给志愿军的一双还未绣完的绣花袜底拿出，颤颤抖抖地拿起针线，一针一针地继续绣着。
    跟着孙媳妇们的歌声，百岁老妈妈不由得也唱起来了：
    “千个坡头共坡岭唉，
    苗家和志愿军心连心咧；
    山坡上啊，开红花，
    志愿军打仗为苗家。
    红丝线，绣红花，
    送给前线的好娃娃；
    志愿军，穿了它，
    冲过上甘岭，
    把美国鬼子打得脑壳开花。
    红丝线，绣红花，
    毛主席来了爱苗家。
    苗家啊，变了样。
    再不是，
    ‘风来风扫地，
        天来天点灯。’
    过去我活了百岁不像人，
    如今我百岁不老还要唱起歌。
    ‘达棒’（感谢）你，毛主席，
    恩情呀，像山河！
    ‘达棒’你，志愿军，
    保卫我百岁头上享太平。”
    第二届赴朝慰问团各个分团的代表们，自去年十
    一月回国后，就这样地在全国各地又一次广泛地把朝鲜前线的英雄事迹，报告祖国各界各族的人民；全国人民对志愿军的热爱，又一次在各个角落沸腾着，并用各种方式表达了出来。
    从白雪皑皑的松花江畔到荔枝花香的海南岛，从辽阔的东海滨到雄峻的玉门关，全国每一个主要城市和重点市县，都有上千上万的人拥簇着欢迎慰问团代表、争抢着听代表们的报告。康藏高原上的藏民兄弟，有的人骑马走四五天路，到昌都来欢迎代表们。人们欢呼着，热情地要求着：“请把志愿军的吩咐都告诉我们！他们要求什么我们就做什么。”……
    据慰问团四个分团的统计，代表们在华东、西南、华北、东北四个行政区，就作了三千二百多次传达报告，直接听到报告的人数达六百二十五万。还有无数的人收听了代表们的广播；许多人参观了代表们带回的图片。各分团的文工队和电影、幻灯放映队，也在进行传达工作的同时在各地演出了从前线带回来的精彩节目，仅在西南和华北两区，观众就达一百万人以上。
    同时，这几百万人又成了报告的传达者。他们把慰问团的声音，这来自朝鲜，来自志愿军的声音，带到了无数工厂的车间，带到了农民的炕头会上，带到了小学生的课堂里，也带到了草原上的牧篷里，带到了辽阔的祖国的每一个角落。
    慰问团代表们的传达报告，在广大人民群众中又
    一次激起了爱国热情的高涨，推动了祖国大规模建设，推动了支援前线和拥军优属的工作。
    在祖国西北高原上的玉门油矿的工人们在冰霜凛烈的露天里连夜赶工，提前凿成了新的油井，用新出的石油来迎接慰问团，支援志愿军。他们把超额完成一月份的生产任务写在自己的爱国公约里，作为自己的一份献礼。他们在慰问团来到的四天里，提出了一百一十件合理化建议。他们向志愿军提出保证：开发祖国富源，加速祖国工业化，坚决完成祖国第一个大规模的五年建设计划。这样的保证，在祖国无数的车间和矿场里，也纷纷提出来了。
    在山西平定县欢乐的农村里，农民们用激动的声音告诉自己的使者：“请转告彭德怀司令员和全体志愿军同志们吧，他们要人给人，要钱给钱，要粮给粮。我们保证抗美援朝到底。”这也就是站在祖国爱国丰产战线上数亿农民的誓言和行动。
    在祖国的国防线上，警惕地钢铁似地捍卫着祖国的天空和海洋、捍卫着祖国的边防的人民解放军战士们，把志愿军的战斗精神贯注在自己的正规化现代化建军运动里。守卫在东海岸的战士们唱着一首快板：“志愿军，保国家，作起战来现代化，新式武器手中拿，喷气飞机天上转，大炮高射炮威风大，打得敌人直害怕。现代化作战顶呱呱，咱们也要掌握它。同志们，努力吧，好好学习志愿军，保卫咱们的新国家。”
    从北京的壮丽的大学到内蒙古草原上的游动小学里，志愿军的声音都成了鼓舞祖国学生“炼好身体，学好功课”的力量泉源。他们把邱少云、黄继光的英雄名字来命名自己的班和组，他们用志愿军的作战精神来学习功课。清华大学展开了学习志愿军的运动，昆明市第一中学十五班的学生提出：各科成绩“向七十分看齐，向八十分进攻”。
    在杭州市，慰问团代表带着全国人民和朝鲜前线战士的敬意，把一件光荣的国际礼品——朝鲜英雄城市元山港一位朝鲜人民军的光荣母亲金贞先送给中国人民志愿军光荣妈妈的一枚戒指——转送给了志愿军的光荣妈妈唐老太太，感谢她把八个英雄儿女都献给了和平事业。慰问团代表慰问了黄继光、刘兴文和易才学烈士的家属，并把英雄们的事迹详尽地告诉了英雄的家乡的人民。无数的母亲与妻子，都为自己的优秀儿女和英雄丈夫而感到光荣和骄傲。无数的人把志愿军的父母看做自己的父母。太谷县朝阳村的农民张成宝寄语给志愿军：“我现在订出了代耕工作的计划，要带动互助组，把军属地至少锄四遍，保证军属增加生产，不让军属有任何困难。”宝鸡市还举行了“拥军优属运动月”。
    祖国人民在第一个大规模建设年给前线的更巨大的支援，和前线日益坚强的钢铁般的战线联在一起，将使敌人任何新的恫吓和讹诈显得更加可笑，将使敌人任何新的冒险失败得更惨。
