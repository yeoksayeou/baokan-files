The Struggle of Japanese Workers in US Military Bases and Factories in Japan
Xu Ming

In order to turn Japan into its military base and arsenal in the Far East, American imperialism, with the help of its running dog, the reactionary Yoshida government, seized many Japanese farmlands and fishing ports to build military bases for the US military; and seized many Japanese factories to rebuild them into munitions factories for the US military. The homes of tens of thousands of Japanese working people were destroyed, and their livelihoods were deprived.

More than 300,000 homeless Japanese people, who had lost their means of survival, were forced by hunger and cold to work in US military bases and US-managed munitions factories, enduring extremely cruel enslavement and exploitation, living a life worse than that of animals. The US military authorities not only used means such as lowering wages, increasing labor intensity, and arbitrarily dismissing workers to cruelly exploit Japanese workers, but also, in order to force Japanese workers to perform inhuman labor and suppress their resistance, blatantly deprived Japanese workers of their freedom and rights. They used American hooligan soldiers as supervisors, armed guards, and Japanese secret agents, as well as military dogs, to monitor the actions of Japanese workers, and forced Japanese workers to wear slave badges with photos and name tags, and ID cards with fingerprints and photos attached, in order to facilitate their enslavement. In some US military bases and US military factories, Japanese workers were unreasonably restricted from even talking, smoking, or going to the toilet. Female workers in a certain workshop at the Tachikawa base were even forbidden from speaking their native language during working hours.

Having suffered such cruel exploitation and inhuman enslavement for a long time, the hatred accumulated by Japanese workers against the American aggressors is growing day by day. With the rise of the Japanese people's movement against the American occupation and for national independence, the political consciousness of Japanese workers in US military bases and US military factories has also rapidly increased. They finally resolutely launched a struggle against resistance.

Under the severe suppression of the US military authorities, Japanese workers in US military bases and US military factories initially used strikes and sabotage to carry out their struggle. For example, in some major US heavy bomber bases, Japanese workers launched a struggle to "make B-29s unable to fly" last spring, posing a great threat to the American aggressors. Also, last year, when the US invading army suffered serious setbacks in Korea, due to the effective strikes by Japanese workers in many US military factories, US weapons awaiting repair in Japan piled up like mountains in some factories, and many repaired weapons malfunctioned again after being transported to the battlefield.

The unprecedented "May Day" struggle and successive large-scale strikes carried out by the Japanese working people last year greatly promoted the struggle of Japanese workers in US military bases and US military factories. Many Japanese workers in US military bases and US military factories, disregarding US military bans, openly carried out strike struggles. From the end of May to June last year, the continuous strikes in US military factories in the Tokyo-Yokohama area, which began at the Higashi Nihon Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. Shimaruko factory, seriously affected the production of US military supplies. The strike by 550 Japanese workers at the Yokosuka US Naval Motor Pool on August 15, and the strike by 3,000 Japanese workers at the Yokohama US Military Logistics Command Motor Vehicle Yard in late September, brought the US military's transportation work to a standstill. In mid-December, Japanese workers at the Yokohama US military base held another strike. Japanese workers at the Osaka US military barracks and US military hospital also held strikes in November.

The US military authorities frequently dispatched armored vehicles, sent military police, troops, and Japanese armed police to suppress the struggling Japanese workers in US military bases and US military factories. However, this violent means not only failed to intimidate Japanese workers, but instead aroused their anger and intensified their struggle. On January 10 this year, when workers at Yokota Base held a welfare conference, although the venue was completely surrounded by US military police, two majors representing the US military commander were finally booed off the stage by 2,000 Japanese workers. At the Sasebo US military base, the Japanese security captain, a long-time henchman of the US military who had been running rampant, was recently driven away under the mass pressure of the workers. Since the end of November last year, Japanese workers in US military bases and US military factories throughout Japan have used strikes, work slowdowns, and other means to demand higher wages, improved treatment, and revised labor contracts, seriously affecting the military operations of the American aggressors. On January 16 this year, the United States News Agency worriedly revealed: "If these workers really strike, it will seriously hinder the work of the US military's main Korean War base in Japan." Now, the resistance of these Japanese workers has developed beyond a purely economic struggle to win immediate interests. More and more Japanese workers have realized that the militarization of Japan will bring them terrible war disasters, and they must resolutely oppose the US actions of preparing for and waging aggressive war in Japan.

The struggle of Japanese workers in US military bases and US military factories is carried out with the strong support of the broad masses of the Japanese people, especially the Japanese people near the bases. They also united with residents near the bases to carry out the struggle. For example, last September, the US military wanted to build US military dormitories in Musashino Town near Tokyo, which aroused fierce opposition from the local people. Japanese workers from Tachikawa, Yokota, Fenritt and other bases near Musashino Town also rose up to support them, and the struggle is still continuing. At the same time, many Japanese workers in US military bases and US military factories, regardless of all suppression and persecution, participated in various struggles of the broad masses of the Japanese people for peace and independence.

The struggle of Japanese workers in US military bases and US military factories is part of the Japanese people's struggle against the United States turning Japan into a US military base. It merges with the Japanese people's struggle against the US occupation and becomes a torrent in the Japanese people's struggle for national independence, which is developing forward.

On January 18 this year, Japanese workers at the US military base in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, held a general mobilization meeting to demand higher wages, improved treatment, and revision of labor contracts. The workers who attended the meeting, disregarding the encirclement of the US military police and Japanese armed police, passed resolutions such as "Oppose the armament of Japan" and "Oppose slave labor," and held a demonstration parade after the meeting.

    在日本的美军基地和美军工厂中的日本工人的斗争
    徐明
    美国帝国主义为了要把日本变成为它在远东的军事基地和兵工厂，利用它的走狗吉田反动政府，强占了日本的许多农田和渔港，修筑成为美国军队的军事基地；抢夺了日本的许多工厂，改建成为美国军队的军火工厂。成千成万日本劳动人民的家园遭到破坏，生计被剥夺。
    有三十多万这样无家可归和失去了生活依靠的日本人民，为饥寒所迫走进了美军基地和美军管理的军火工厂中工作，忍受着极端残酷的奴役和剥削，过着牛马不如的生活。美军当局不仅用压低工资、提高劳动强度、随便解雇工人等等手段对日本工人进行残酷的剥削，而且为了强迫日本工人进行非人的劳动和镇压日本工人的反抗，竟然横暴地剥夺了日本工人的自由和权利。他们使用美国流氓军人充当的监工、武装警备员和日本特务以及军用犬等监视着日本工人的行动，而且强迫日本工人配带奴隶标志的附有照片的姓名牌和捺有指纹贴着照片的身份证，以图达到他们便于奴役的目的。有些美军基地和美军工厂中的日本工人，连谈话、抽烟、上厕所等都受到无理的限制。立川基地某一工场中的女工，甚至被禁止在工作时间内用本国语言说话。
    长期受着这样的残酷剥削和非人奴役的日本工人，对美国侵略者积累的仇恨与日俱增。随着日本广大人民反对美国占领、争取民族独立运动的高涨，美军基地和美军工厂中日本工人的政治觉悟也迅速提高。他们终于坚决展开了反抗的斗争。
    在美军当局严酷的镇压下，美军基地和美军工厂中日本工人最初是用怠工和破坏行动来进行斗争的。例如在某些美国主要的重轰炸机基地中，日本工人在去年春天展开了“使B二十九飞不动”的斗争，给予美国侵略者很大的威胁。又如去年美国侵略军在朝鲜遭受到严重打击的时候，由于许多美军工厂的日本工人进行了有效的怠工，以致美军在日本待修理的武器在某些工厂中堆积如山，而且许多经过修理的武器运到战场上就又突然发生了故障。
    去年日本全国劳动人民进行的规模空前的“五一”节斗争和连续数次的大罢工，大大地推动了美军基地和美军工厂中日本工人的斗争。许多美军基地和美军工厂中的日本工人，不顾美军禁令，公开进行了罢工的斗争。从去年五月底到六月间，自东日本重工业公司下丸子工厂开始而展开的东京横滨一带美军工厂的连续罢工，严重地影响了美军军用品的生产。八月十五日横须贺美国海军汽车库的五百五十名日本工人举行的罢工，以及九月下旬横滨美军后勤司令部汽车场三千名日本工人的罢工，曾使美军的运输工作陷于半停顿状态。十二月中旬横滨美军基地的日本工人又举行了罢工。大阪美军兵营和美军医院的日本工人在十一月间也举行了罢工。
    美军当局经常出动装甲汽车，派遣宪兵、军队以及日本武装警察对美军基地和美军工厂中斗争的日本工人进行镇压。然而，这种暴力手段不仅没有吓
    倒日本工人，反而更激起了他们的愤怒，使他们的
    斗争更激烈地展开了。今年一月十日，横田基地工人举行福利大会时，尽管会场完全被美军宪兵包围，但两名代表美军司令官的少校，终于被两千名日本工人哄下了台。在佐世保美军基地，长久横行霸道的美军爪牙日本人警备队长，最近也在工人的群众压力下被赶走了。从去年十一月底起，全日本各地美军基地和美军工厂中的日本工人，用怠工、罢工等等方式进行的要求提高工资、改善待遇、改订劳务合同等的斗争，严重地影响了美国侵略者的军事行动。今年一月十六日美国合众社就曾忧虑地透露说：“如果这些工人真的罢工，那将严重地妨碍美军在日本的主要的朝鲜战争基地的工作。”现在，这些日本工人的反抗已经发展到不仅是单纯争取切身利益的经济斗争了，愈来愈多的日本工人已经认识到日本的军事基地化将带给他们可怕的战争灾难，他们必须坚决反对美国在日本准备和进行侵略战争的行动。
    美军基地和美军工厂中日本工人的斗争是在日本广大人民、特别是在基地附近日本人民的有力支持下进行的。他们并且和基地附近的居民联合起来进行斗争。例如去年九月美军要在东京附近的武藏野镇建造美军宿舍，引起了当地人民的激烈反对，邻近武藏野镇的立川、横田、芬立脱等基地的日本工人也起来支援，斗争到现在仍在继续着。同时，许多美军基地和美军工厂的日本工人，也不顾一切镇压和迫害，参加了日本广大人民的各种争取和平与独立的斗争。
    美军基地和美军工厂中日本工人的斗争，是日本人民反对美国把日本变成美国侵略基地斗争的一部分，它和日本广大人民反对美国占领的斗争汇合而成为日本人民争取民族独立斗争的巨流，正在向前发展。（附图片）
    今年一月十八日，日本神奈川县美军基地的日本工人为了要求提高工资，改善待遇，改订劳务合同等事举行总奋起大会。与会工人不顾美军宪兵和日本武装警察的包围，通过了“反对武装日本”、“反对奴隶劳动”等决议，会后并举行了示威游行。
