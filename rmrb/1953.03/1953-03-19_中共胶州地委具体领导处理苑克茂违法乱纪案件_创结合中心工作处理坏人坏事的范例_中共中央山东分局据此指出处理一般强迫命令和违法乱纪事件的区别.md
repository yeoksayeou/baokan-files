The CPC Jiaozhou Prefectural Committee Specifically Led the Handling of Yuan Kemao's Illegal and Disciplined Case
Creating a Model for Handling Bad People and Bad Deeds in Conjunction with Central Work
The CPC Central Committee's Shandong Branch Pointed out the Difference Between Handling General Coercive Orders and Illegal and Disciplined Events Based on This

[This Newspaper's News] Yuan Kemao, the township head of Yuligou Township in Wulian County, Shandong, illegally violated discipline, framed farmer Yuan Fangyi, and forced Yuan Fangyi's parents to death. After Yuan Fangyi's uncle complained to the Jiaozhou Commissioner's Office, the injustice was redressed, and the public was greatly pleased. Below is the report from the CPC Jiaozhou Prefectural Committee to the CPC Central Committee's Shandong Branch regarding the handling of this incident and the Shandong Branch's instructions. In the Shandong Branch's instructions, the Shandong Party organization was correctly pointed out the difference between handling general coercive order incidents and handling illegal and disciplined events. In the Jiaozhou Prefectural Committee's report, a model for handling bad people and bad deeds in conjunction with central work and mobilizing the masses was correctly pointed out.

The CPC Jiaozhou Prefectural Committee's Report to the CPC Central Committee Shandong Branch:

The following is a report on the serious incident of Yuan Kemao, the township head of Yuligou Township, Eleventh District, Wulian County, Jiaozhou Prefecture, illegally violating discipline, framing farmer Yuan Fangyi, and forcing Yuan Fangyi's parents to death, as well as the bureaucratic errors committed by county and district leading cadres, resulting in two wrongful arrests and judgments, and our experience in handling this case in a high-profile manner:

(1) Yuan Fangyi, a farmer from Zhangzhuang Village, Yuligou Township, Eleventh District, Wulian County, is of middle peasant status. His father, Yuan Dexiang, and mother, Liu, were both honest and simple farmers. Before liberation (1944), due to feudal superstition, the family of three was introduced to the "Sage and Virtuous Way" by relatives, but they were not practitioners, and had no history of crime. In 1947, Yuan Fangyi joined the People's Liberation Army, and returned home to farm in 1949.

The township head, Yuan Kemao, was a bad element who had served in the puppet army and bandit troops, beating and scolding the masses with the bandit army, extorting money, kidnapping and robbing, and committing all kinds of evil. After liberation, he speculated and sneaked into the Party, seized rural leadership, consistently bullying superiors and subordinates, binding and beating the masses, raping women, embezzling the fruits of struggle, and embezzling grain and fodder from military dependents' production income, violating laws and discipline to the extreme.

In 1948, Yuan Fangyi's mother, Liu, was found by Yuan Kemao and struggled at the women's meeting for reflecting Yuan Kemao's affairs with women, and he beat her so badly that she could not move. Yuan Fangyi's father, Yuan Dexiang, had also refused to store stolen goods for Yuan Kemao. In 1949, Yuan Kemao falsely accused Yuan Fangyi's guests and was criticized by the district. Because of these things, Yuan Kemao intended to retaliate against Yuan Fangyi.

In the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the banning of Taoist sects in April 1951, Yuan Kemao falsely accused the district committee in the name of the masses, saying that Yuan Fangyi was a Sage and Virtuous Way master, colluding with counter-revolutionary elements to carry out Taoist activities. The district committee listened to one side and reported to the higher authorities, and the leading cadres of Wulian County also approved Yuan Fangyi's arrest without investigation, and wrongly sentenced Yuan Fangyi to one year of imprisonment with a reprieve. After Yuan Fangyi was arrested, Yuan Kemao became even more arrogant, successively convening two village meetings, falsely accusing Yuan Fangyi of being a counter-revolutionary, saying that this time he was "meat bun beating the dog," with no way back, and announced that Yuan Dexiang's family was a counter-revolutionary family and should be controlled, and whoever went to his house would be treated the same as counter-revolutionary elements; if his family went to another house, he would open his "club meeting" (meaning to beat with sticks). When the second meeting was held, Liu asked for leave due to illness, and Yuan Kemao forced her to participate, and scolded Liu for being dishonest, saying: "She will be smashed to death sooner or later." Yuan Dexiang and his wife suffered humiliation and were forced, and missed their son, crying in each other's arms, unable to sleep all night. The next day, Liu deceived her daughter-in-law and husband out and hanged themselves. Yuan Dexiang returned home and saw that his wife was dead, and also hanged himself with one end of the rope Liu used to hang herself. All the villagers who heard the news were sad and wept.

In July of the same year, Yuan Fangyi was released on probation and returned home, but Yuan Kemao was still not reconciled and continued to try to frame him, attempting to cut the grass and eradicate the roots. In February 1952, he used the incident of militiamen Xing Yulai and Jia Wenxiang accidentally firing their guns to threaten the two militiamen with beatings and guns, forcing them to falsely accuse Yuan Fangyi of luring them to kill township cadres. He also privately fabricated accusations, forcing the two militiamen to put their fingerprints on them (after being coerced, Xing got sick for more than ten days and wanted to commit suicide; Jia attempted suicide but failed). With the layout completed, Yuan Kemao went to the county public security bureau's working point to falsely accuse him. The cadres at the working point, Shan Shichang, did not follow the mass line in the investigation, and also believed the lies of Yuan Kemao's mother and sister (both of whom were female cadres), detaining Yuan Fangyi and reporting to the district for handling. The district also reported to the county government in the same way. County head Dong Zouji (who has now been transferred) adopted a bureaucratic approach and instructed on April 16 to arrest Yuan Fangyi for the second time. Under the inducement and coercion of Wu Tingshan, the deputy director of the County Public Security Bureau, Yuan Fangyi was forced to confess and was wrongly sentenced to three years of imprisonment, to be executed immediately. During this period, the parents of militiaman Jia Wenxiang went to the district to report the facts, but Liu Rongting, the secretary of the district committee, only transferred it to the district cadres stationed in the township for handling. Although the matter was also raised at the district committee meeting for discussion, no investigation or handling was carried out.

It was not until last December that Yuan Fangyi's uncle, Yuan Dezhen, came to the Jiaozhou Commissioner's Office to complain that the truth of the incident was fully clarified after the prefectural committee and the Commissioner's Office sent people to investigate. After the case was clarified, we instructed the Wulian County Committee: to expel Yuan Kemao from the Party, and the Wulian County Government to revoke his administrative position, arrest him and bring him to justice; to release the wrongly detained Yuan Fangyi, and to handle this case in a high-profile manner; at the same time, those who were derelict in their duties due to bureaucracy in this case should also be given Party discipline and administrative sanctions according to the circumstances.

(2) From handling this typical case in a high-profile manner, we have the following experiences and understandings:

(1) Only by relying on the masses through the central work and following the mass line can we accurately understand the case. When the procuratorate cadres went to the countryside to investigate this time, they started by helping the central work, promoting cadres and the masses to carry out winter production mutual aid work, especially understanding the urgent needs of the masses, leading the local masses to repair wells, solving the difficulty of drinking water for the whole village, so as to become one with the masses, overcome the masses' difficulties in approaching us and reporting the situation due to the long-term rule of bad cadres, and temporarily stabilize the emotions of bad cadres to ensure the smooth progress of the investigation work.

The investigation started with the households that suffered serious persecution by Yuan Kemao, then to the surrounding masses, and from this village to other villages. A combination of individual visits and small meetings was used to conduct an in-depth and comprehensive investigation. It took twelve days to investigate two townships, seven villages, and eighty households, a total of one hundred and forty people. These included cadres and people from all walks of life. Fifty-six out of the sixty-two households in the village were investigated. In order to thoroughly clarify the case, relevant personnel were found more than a hundred miles away to check the materials. During the investigation, by correctly publicizing the Party's policies and showing the government's attitude—resolutely supporting the masses in opposing bad people and bad deeds—the masses' concerns were dispelled and the masses' awareness was enlightened. At this time, the masses revealed Yuan Kemao's various crimes and expressed their determination to fight him. Experience has proved that the process of understanding the case is also the process of mobilizing and organizing the masses.

(2) To handle typical cases in a high-profile manner and fully mobilize the masses. After the case was clarified, the Wulian County Committee immediately expelled Yuan Kemao from the Party, and the county government revoked his administrative position, arrested him and brought him to justice. Yuan Fangyi, who had been wrongly detained, was released, and mass meetings of more than 1,000 people from three nearby townships and ten villages and representative meetings of eight villages were held successively to handle the case in a high-profile manner. Liu Rongting, the county head of Wulian County, and relevant personnel made a painful self-criticism to the masses for their bureaucratic and derelict errors. In this way, the masses were fully mobilized, the Party and government's political influence was restored, and the relationship between the Party and the government and the masses was strengthened; at the same time, the cadres and the masses were educated, and justice was promoted. The masses responded well. After Yuan Kemao was arrested and Yuan Fangyi was released, the masses of Zhangzhuang were jubilant and reflected: "Yuan Kemao has come to the end." "The government has eliminated a scourge for us." Aunt Xing Yu held Yuan Fangyi's hand and touched Yuan Fangyi's head and said: "Child, you are back! Don't forget that the People's Government saved you and the lives of all the old and young in the village. If Yuan Kemao is allowed to be the township head for another two years, I don't know how many people will be forced to death." Yuan Fangyi's wife said: "If it weren't for the People's Government to relieve us of our suffering, we would never be able to turn over in our lives." Grandpa Yuan Dezhen ran more than ten miles to report the good news to Yuan Fangyi's father-in-law without even bothering to eat. Some of the masses were so happy that they forgot to eat, and some women who had planned to go to their mothers' homes did not go. Grandpa Sun Chengji, who was eighty-three years old and blind, was also so happy that he hugged and kissed Comrade Ma from the procuratorate again and again. That night, many households fried peanuts and ate them like it was the New Year, and did not sleep until midnight. After the mass meeting announced the handling of Yuan Kemao, the masses shouted: "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" The masses said that the procuratorate was the blue sky master, and that they were "liberated for the second time." Some farmers wrote congratulatory letters to the comrades of the procuratorate, and some killed chickens and cooked meals to prepare to invite the comrades of the procuratorate to eat. When the comrades of the procuratorate were about to leave, the masses of the village lined up to see them off, and some of the masses sent them more than ten miles out of the village, and only returned after repeated thanks and refusals.

(3) Handling people's letters and handling typical cases in a high-profile manner is the most practical and effective way to carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline. Through the handling of the "Yuan Fangyi incident," good cadres who wholeheartedly serve the people were encouraged, and those who violated laws and discipline were warned, which strongly supported the masses' just struggle against bad people and bad deeds. Good cadres have become more active. Some cadres with serious coercive commandism have also taken the initiative to find leading cadres to examine their mistakes. The broad masses of people have become bolder in exposing the behavior of lawless and undisciplined elements. In the process of handling this case alone, the local masses have made as many as eleven oral and written accusations to the comrades of the procuratorate (these cases are being handled separately).

Through the handling of typical cases, the serious bureaucratic style of leading cadres has been profoundly and forcefully exposed. The Wulian County Committee and County Government fully realized from the "Yuan Fangyi incident" that: due to their own serious bureaucracy, they did not understand and care about the suffering of the masses, and listened to the false accusations of bad elements, wrongly arresting and wrongly judging Yuan Fangyi twice, indulging and supporting bad elements who violated laws and discipline, causing the masses of Zhangzhuang to suffer from bad elements for a long time, resulting in the serious incident of Yuan Fangyi's parents committing suicide. They made a painful self-criticism at the county, district and township cadres' meetings and the county people's representative meetings, and listened to the cadres' and representatives' exposure and criticism of the bureaucratic style of leading cadres. This has improved leadership and educated cadres.

(4) Through the handling of the "Yuan Fangyi incident," it has been further proved that carrying out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline is the basic guarantee for doing all work well. Experience has proved that carrying out this struggle in conjunction with the central work not only does not conflict with the central work, but also greatly encourages the political sentiments of the masses and powerfully promotes various tasks after punishing bad elements who violate laws and discipline, relieving the suffering of the masses, and strengthening the relationship between the Party and the government and the masses. For example, after handling the bad element Yuan Kemao, the production enthusiasm of the masses in Zhangzhuang was unprecedentedly high, and they all went to the fields to step on wheat, and the mutual aid group also developed from three groups to seven groups, and studied the implementation of work recording and accounting. The masses are no longer "drifting along" but making long-term production plans.

(5) Combined with production, the various organizations in the village were reorganized. In the process of handling Yuan Kemao, activists were discovered and cultivated; after democratic discussion, three bad cadres were removed, and four new cadres were elected; six young activists signed up to participate in the militia; two young activists applied to join the Communist Youth League; the membership of two Communist Youth League members who had been expelled by Yuan Kemao was restored; one bad League member was expelled; the "control" imposed on Wang Meifang's household by Yuan Kemao in order to suppress her was cancelled. As a result, various organizations have become active, and the whole village presents a new atmosphere.

The main shortcoming in organizing the handling of this case is: the work of educating and improving the cadres of the district through the district-level organization was not done well enough. Some issues were not discussed with the district committee during the investigation and handling, and they were not helped to sum up the lessons after the handling, which made some cadres in the district suspect that the higher authorities did not trust them. The district committee felt that the handling was very good and the gains were great, but they have not consciously accepted the lessons of this incident. We must pay attention to solving this problem in the future.

CPC Jiaozhou Prefectural Committee, March 3

The CPC Central Committee Shandong Branch's Instructions to the Jiaozhou Prefectural Committee, Various Prefectural Committees, Municipal Committees, and County Committees:

The Jiaozhou Prefectural Committee's report on handling the "Yuan Fangyi incident" in a high-profile manner has been received. This report vividly illustrates that: as long as we seize a typical bad person or bad deed like Yuan Kemao, the township head of Yuligou Township, Wulian County, who framed farmer Yuan Fangyi, which has both crimes and popular grievances, and handle it in a high-profile manner, it will greatly encourage the emotions of the masses, increase the masses' courage to expose bad people and bad deeds, greatly increase the democratic atmosphere, strengthen the relationship between the Party and the masses, and many new activists will emerge among the masses, improve various organizations, and promote current tasks, making the appearance of such villages and towns new. Some time ago, the Huang County Committee grasped and handled the illegal and disciplined elements of the Sanjia Yu family, Yu Qian (who served as the party branch secretary and township head), and the Huimin Prefectural Committee grasped and handled the bad element Nie Shunde (village branch secretary, nicknamed Third King) in Wang Hanlin Village, Bin County, and both achieved the same effect, which are also powerful proofs.

When selecting such typical events, it is necessary to be accurate and appropriate, and to pay close attention to drawing a clear line between coercive orders and violations of laws and discipline. Cadres who have committed serious coercive commandism by beating and scolding the masses while performing their work should not be confused with lawless and undisciplined elements who extort money, rape women, frame the masses, and commit all kinds of evil. The former should mainly be educated and transformed. Of course, those who have forced people to death due to their coercive commandism should also be severely punished, but our main target of attack is the latter, the lawless and undisciplined elements who have committed many crimes and caused great public outrage. Grasping such prominent typical events and handling them in a high-profile manner will surely achieve good results and will not have any side effects.

All localities and counties should select two types of typical examples of good and bad workers. We must first grasp the more prominent typical bad people and bad deeds and handle them in order to strike at evil spirits, promote justice, and inspire people, and pave the way for the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline. Then we must select more typical good people and good deeds to commend in order to promote righteousness and set an example. When selecting good people and good deeds, we do not require them to be too complete. Even if a leading cadre in a village, township, district, or county has done something that satisfies the masses in one thing or one job, and has something worth learning from, it should also be commended. For example, Junan County's summary and evaluation in leading production work, Licheng County's insistence on holding county and township people's congresses well, and Zhucheng County's attention to explaining policies and methods when deploying work in the second half of last year are all good, and all have achieved the effect of changing work style and improving work. Chairman Mao instructed us: Each county in the province should select a typical bad person or bad deed that is enough to be a warning and a typical good person or good deed that is enough to be emulated and publish them in the newspaper. It is hoped that the local county committees and newspapers will conscientiously follow and implement them.

About 10% of the backward villages in our province have three reasons:

(1) The suppression of counter-revolutionaries is not thorough, and counter-revolutionary elements have infiltrated our grassroots organizations, stealing positions and oppressing the masses. For example, in Xialiulian Village, Laixi County, the village government and armed forces were controlled by counter-revolutionary elements Yu Xiangong, Yu Xianyang, etc.;

(2) Rural organizations are controlled by degenerated and deteriorated new bullies, who oppress the masses and do evil. For example, Zhao Wangtang Village, Jining County, is controlled by bad cadres Wang Shukun, Wang Shushen, etc.;

(3) The leadership has always been weak or there have been multiple deviations in the work, which have not been corrected, resulting in mass dissatisfaction and backward work.

The problems of the above three types of backward villages should not be solved by taking crude and rush methods. We should deeply understand the situation of the masses, combine with the current work, and prescribe the right medicine. For the first type of backward village, we must continue to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements and remove obstacles through the suppression of counter-revolutionaries; for the second type of backward village, we must remove the "stones" through the struggle against violations of laws and discipline; for the third type of backward village, we must correct errors in future work, strengthen leadership, and deeply implement policies and connect with the masses. The problems of these backward villages should be solved in a planned and step-by-step manner within one year, so that the work of these villages can catch up with the general level, in order to strive for the overall improvement of the level of rural work.

It is hoped that the local prefectural committees, municipal committees, and county committees will study and implement the above opinions.

    中共胶州地委具体领导处理苑克茂违法乱纪案件
    创结合中心工作处理坏人坏事的范例
    中共中央山东分局据此指出处理一般强迫命令和违法乱纪事件的区别
    【本报讯】山东五莲县于里沟乡乡长苑克茂，违法乱纪，陷害农民苑芳义，并逼死苑芳义的父母一案，经苑芳义的伯父向胶州专员公署控告，冤狱得申，群情大快。下面是中共胶州地委向中共中央山东分局关于这一事件处理经过的报告和山东分局的指示。在山东分局的指示中，给山东党组织正确地指出了处理一般的强迫命令事件和处理违法乱纪事件的区别。在胶州地委的报告中，正确地指出了结合中心工作、发动群众处理坏人坏事的范例。
    中共胶州地委的报告中共中央山东分局：
    兹将胶州专区所属五莲县十一区于里沟乡乡长苑克茂违法乱纪，陷害农民苑芳义，逼死苑芳义父母，县、区领导干部犯官僚主义错误，两次错捕错判的严重事件，和我们对这个案件大张旗鼓地进行处理的经验报告如下：
      （一）五莲县十一区于里沟乡张庄村农民苑芳义，中农成份。其父苑德祥，母刘氏，都是忠厚老实的农民。解放前（一九四四年）由于封建迷信思想，全家三人曾由亲戚引进“圣贤道”，但他们并不是办道人员，历史上也没有罪恶。一九四七年苑芳义曾参加人民解放军，一九四九年回家务农。
    该乡乡长苑克茂是个坏分子，曾干过伪顽匪军，随匪军打骂群众，敲诈勒索，绑架抢劫，作恶多端。解放后投机混入党内，攫取了乡村领导权，一贯地欺上压下，绑打群众，奸污妇女，贪污斗争果实，贪污军属生产收入的粮草，违法乱纪至极。
      一九四八年苑芳义之母刘氏因反映苑克茂乱搞妇女，被苑克茂找到妇女会上斗争，并被他毒打得不能行动。苑芳义之父苑德祥，又曾拒绝替苑克茂存放赃物。一九四九年苑克茂诬告苑芳义的客人，也受到区的批评。由于这些事，苑克茂就存心向苑芳义进行打击报复。
    一九五一年四月镇压反革命和取缔道会门中，苑克茂就假借群众名义向区委诬告，说苑芳义是圣贤道师，勾结反革命分子进行道会门活动。区委偏听偏信，向上级呈报，而五莲县领导干部也没有调查就错误地批准了逮捕苑芳义，并错判苑芳义一年徒刑，缓期执行。苑芳义被捕后，苑克茂更加嚣张，接连召开两次村民会，诬蔑苑芳义是反革命分子，说他这次是“肉包子打狗”，有去路无回路，并宣布苑德祥家庭是反革命家庭，应受管制，谁要到他家去就与反革命分子一律同罪；他家人若到别家，就开他的“扒棍子会”（用棍打的意思）。开第二次会时，刘氏因病请假，苑克茂逼令她参加，并骂刘氏不老实，说：“早晚要砸死她。”苑德祥夫妇吃屈受逼，又加想念儿子，抱头痛哭，一夜未睡。第二天刘氏将儿媳、丈夫骗出，上吊自杀。苑德祥回家见其妻已死，也用刘氏上吊的绳子一端吊死。全村群众闻讯，无不伤心落泪。
    同年七月，苑芳义被判缓刑回家，苑克茂仍不死心，继续设法进行陷害，企图斩草除根。一九五二年二月，即借本村民兵邢玉来、贾文祥持枪走火事件，以打骂和持枪恫吓手段，逼迫该二民兵诬赖是受苑芳义拉拢，企图打死乡干部。并私造状词，逼迫该二民兵按上指印（二民兵被威逼后，邢得病十余日，并想自杀；贾自杀未遂）。布局已成，苑克茂就到县公安局工作点进行诬告。工作点干部单世昌调查中不走群众路线，又偏信苑克茂之母、妹（均是妇女干部）等的假话，将苑芳义扣押报区处理，区又照样呈报县府。县长董奏吉（现已调走）采取官僚主义办法，批示于四月十六日二次逮捕苑芳义。在县公安局副局长吴廷善等人的引供逼供下，苑芳义被迫招供，又被错判三年徒刑，立即执行。在这期间，民兵贾文祥父母曾到区据实控告，但区委书记刘荣廷只转交给驻该乡的区干部办理，虽然也曾将此事提到区委员会上研究过，也没有查究处理。
    直到去年十二月苑芳义的伯父苑德贞亲来胶州专署控告，地委、专署派人前往调查后，这一事件的真相才完全明了。案情查清后，我们就指示五莲县委：开除苑克茂的党籍，由五莲县府撤销他的行政职务，加以逮捕法办；释放错押的苑芳义，并对这
    一案件进行大张旗鼓的处理；同时对此案中官僚主义失职人员，也分别情节，给以党纪和行政处分。
      （二）从大张旗鼓地处理这个典型案件中，我们有如下的经验和体会：
      （1）通过中心工作，依靠群众，走群众路线，才能确切地了解案情。这次检察署干部下乡调查时，即从帮助中心工作入手，推动干部群众开展冬季生产互助工作，特别是了解群众迫切要求，领导当地群众修好水井，解决了全村吃水的困难，从而与群众打成一片，克服了群众因长时期受坏干部统治不敢接近我们，不敢向我们反映情况的困难，并暂时稳定了坏干部的情绪，以保证调查工作的顺利进行。
    调查首先从遭受苑克茂迫害严重的户作起，再到周围群众，从本村又到外村。运用个别访问和小型会相结合的方法，作了深入全面的调查。前后经过十二天时间，调查了两个乡，七个村，八十户，共一百四十人。其中包括干部和各阶层群众。该庄六十二户就调查了五十六户。为了彻底弄清案情，曾到百余里以外找有关人员查对材料。调查中通过正确宣传党的政策，表明政府的态度——坚决支持群众反对坏人坏事——解除了群众顾虑，启发了群众觉悟，这时群众才揭发出苑克茂的种种罪行，并表示坚决和他斗争。经验证明：了解案情的过程，也就是发动组织群众的过程。
      （2）大张旗鼓地处理典型案件，充分地发动群众。案情查清后，五莲县委立即开除苑克茂的党籍，县府撤销其行政职务并逮捕法办。释放了错押的苑芳义，并先后召开附近三个乡、十个村千余人的群众大会和八个村的代表会，进行大张旗鼓的处理。五莲县县长刘荣廷及有关人员对官僚主义，失职错误，向群众进行了沉痛的检讨。这样，就充分地发动了群众，挽回了党和政府的政治影响，密切了党和政府与群众的关系；同时教育了干部和群众，伸张了正义。群众反映良好。在逮捕苑克茂、释放苑芳义后，张庄群众欢欣鼓舞，纷纷反映：“苑克茂可做到头了。”“政府给我们除了一害。”邢于氏大娘拉着苑芳义的手，摸着苑芳义的头说：“孩子你可回来啦！你可别忘了人民政府救了你和全村老少的命。要是让苑克茂再干两年乡长，被逼死的人还不知有多少。”苑芳义之妻说：“若不是人民政府给咱出苦，一辈子也不能翻身。”苑德贞大爷连饭也顾不得吃，跑到十里以外给苑芳义的岳父报喜信。有的群众欢喜得连饭也忘了吃，有的妇女原打算走娘家也不走了。八十三岁双目失明的孙诚记大爷，也欢喜得抱着检察署马同志连连接吻。当晚许多户像过年节一样，炒花生吃，半夜未睡。群众大会宣布对苑克茂的处理后，群众高呼：“共产党万岁！”
    “毛主席万岁！”群众说检察署是青天大老爷，说自己是“二次解放”。有的农民写贺信给检察署同志，有的杀鸡做饭准备请检察署同志吃。检察署同志临行时，该庄群众列队欢送，有的群众直送出村十余里，经再三谢阻才回去。
        （3）处理人民来信，大张旗鼓地办理典型案件，是开展反官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪斗争的最实际有效的方式。通过“苑芳义事件”的处理，鼓舞了全心全意为人民服务的好干部，警告了违法乱纪的分子，有力地支持了群众反对坏人坏事的正义斗争。好干部更加积极起来。有些强迫命令作风严重的干部，也自动找领导干部检讨错误。广大群众更大胆地揭发违法乱纪分子的行为。只在处理这一案件的过程中，当地群众用口头、书面向检察署同志控告的就有十一起之多（这些案件正分别进行处理）。
      通过典型案件的处理，对领导干部严重的官僚主义作风给了深刻有力的揭发。五莲县委、县政府从
    “苑芳义事件”中充分认识到：由于本身存在严重的官僚主义，不了解和不关心群众疾苦，偏听坏分子的诬告，对苑芳义两次错捕错判，放纵和支持了违法乱纪的坏分子，使张庄群众长时期遭受坏分子迫害，致造成苑芳义父母自杀的严重事件。他们在县区乡干部大会上和县各界人民代表会上作了沉痛的检讨，听取了干部和代表对领导干部官僚主义的揭发和批评。这就提高了领导，教育了干部。
      （4）通过“苑芳义事件”的处理，更加证明了开展反官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争，是作好一切工作的基本保证。经验证明：结合中心工作来开展这一斗争，不但与中心工作没有矛盾，而且在惩治了违法乱纪的坏分子，解除了群众的痛苦，密切了党与政府和群众的关系之后，大大地鼓舞了群众的政治情绪，有力地推动了各项工作。例如处理了坏分子苑克茂后，张庄群众的生产情绪就空前高涨，都下地踩麦子，互助组也由三个组发展到七个组，并研究实行记工算账。群众再不是“混日子”而是打长谱生产了。
      （5）结合生产，整理了村的各种组织。在处理苑克茂过程中，发现和培养了积极分子；经过民主讨论撤换了三个坏干部，新选举了四个干部；六个青年积极分子报名参加民兵；两个青年积极分子申请参加青年团；恢复了被苑克茂开除的两个青年团员的团籍；开除一个坏团员；取消了苑克茂为了打击王梅芳而加给该户的“管制”。因此，各种组织都活跃了起来，全村呈现一片新的气象。
    在组织处理这一案件中主要的缺点是：对于通过该区区级组织，教育提高区的干部这一项工作作得不够。在调查处理中有些问题没有同区委研究，处理后也没有帮助他们总结教训，致使该区有的干部怀疑上级对他们是否有点不相信。区委感觉处理的很好，收获很大，但对这一事件的教训还没有自觉地接受。今后必须注意解决这个问题。
                        中共胶州地委三月三日
    中共中央山东分局的指示胶州地委、各地委、市委、县委：
    胶州地委关于大张旗鼓处理“苑芳义事件”的情况报告收到了。这个报告生动地说明了：只要抓住像五莲县于里沟乡乡长苑克茂陷害农民苑芳义这种既有罪行又有民愤的典型的坏人坏事，大张旗鼓地加以处理，就大大地鼓舞了群众的情绪，提高了群众揭发坏人坏事的勇气，民主空气大为增高，党与群众的关系密切起来，在群众中涌现出许多新的积极分子，改善了各种组织，推动了当前各项工作，使这类乡村的面貌为之一新。前些时黄县县委抓紧处理三甲于家违法乱纪分子于谦（曾任党的支部书记和乡长）事件，惠民地委抓紧处理了滨县王汉林村坏分子聂顺德（村支部书记、外号三王爷）事件，都得到了同样的效果，也都是有力的证明。
    在选择这类典型事件时，要准确，要得当，要密切注意划清强迫命令和违法乱纪的界限，不能把因执行工作打骂群众犯了严重的强迫命令作风的干部与那种敲诈勒索、强奸妇女、陷害群众、无恶不作的违法乱纪分子混为一谈。对前者主要是教育改造，当然因强迫命令作风以致逼死人命者也应当严肃惩处，但我们打击的主要对象则是后者，是罪行累累民愤很大的违法乱纪分子。抓住这类突出的典型事件，大张旗鼓地进行处理，必然会收到良好效果，而不会发生任何副作用。
    各地各县都应当选择出工作人员中好坏两种典型。要先抓住比较突出的典型的坏人坏事加以处理，以打击邪气，伸张正义，振奋人心，为反对官僚主义、命令主义及违法乱纪斗争开辟路道。而后要选择比较典型的好人好事加以表扬，以发扬正气，树立榜样。在选择好人好事时，不要求其过于完备，即便是一个村、一个乡、一个区或一个县的领导干部在一件事、一种工作上做的为群众满意，有值得学习的地方，也应当加以表扬。例如莒南县在领导生产工作中进行总结评比，历城县坚持开好县、乡人代会，诸城县在去年下半年布置工作时注意交代政策、交代做法，这些都是好的，都得到了转变作风改进工作的效果。毛主席指示我们：全省每一县都要选择一个典型的足以令人警戒的坏人坏事和一个典型的足以令人仿效的好人好事登载报纸。希望各地县委和报社切实遵照执行。
    我省大约还有百分之十左右的落后村，这有三种原因：
      （1）镇压反革命不彻底，反革命分子打入我基层组织，盗窃职权，欺压群众。例如莱西县的下柳连庄，村政权和武装都被反革命分子于显功、于显阳等所操纵；
      （2）乡村组织被蜕化变质的新恶霸分子所掌握，他们压迫群众，为非作恶。例如济宁县的赵王堂村，被坏干部王书坤、王书申等所把持；
      （3）领导一贯薄弱或工作上多次出过偏差，没有得到纠正，致使群众不满，工作落后。
    以上三种落后村的问题都不宜于采取粗糙的突击的办法去解决。应当深入了解群众情况，结合当前工作，对症下药。对于第一种落后村要通过镇压反革命工作，继续肃清反革命分子，扫除障碍；对于第二种落后村要通过反对违法乱纪斗争搬掉“石头”；对于第三种落后村要在今后工作中改正错误，加强领导，深入地贯彻政策，联系群众。对这些落后村的问题要在一年内有计划有步骤地加以解决，使这些村的工作跟上一般水平，以争取农村工作的水平普遍提高。
    以上意见，望各地委、市委、县委研究执行。
                            山东分局三月十一日
