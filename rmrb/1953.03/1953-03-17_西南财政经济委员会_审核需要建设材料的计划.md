Southwest Financial and Economic Committee Reviews Plans for Construction Materials

    The Southwest Administrative Committee's Financial and Economic Committee carefully reviewed the plans for construction materials needed by relevant departments, and strengthened the work of unified allocation. The supply and demand of timber and cement in the first quarter have been basically balanced.
    In this review of the original plans of various units, the Southwest District Financial and Economic Committee found that there was a general tendency of departmentalism and unrealistic planning, with excessive, premature, and indiscriminate requests for high-grade materials. For example, the construction units under the Finance and Economics Committee of the People's Government of Xikang Province insisted on transferring cement in the first quarter, even though the plan had not been approved and the design had not been completed. The Southwest Iron and Steel Bureau originally requested more than 5,700 cubic meters of timber in the first quarter than was actually needed. Some cultural and educational departments originally planned for timber needs that exceeded their actual needs by more than double. Units applying for cement allocation generally abused high-grade cement. Ordinary projects could use 300-grade cement, but the plans called for using higher 400-grade cement even for paving floors. The Southwest Financial and Economic Committee strictly reviewed and revised these plans, and at the same time, organized inspection teams to specifically check the storage and use of materials in various construction units. It was found that the units in Chongqing alone had more than 30,000 cubic meters of timber accumulated over the years. The Southwest Railway System also automatically checked out 28,000 cubic meters of timber. Therefore, some construction units, which were originally supposed to be allocated a large amount of timber according to the original plan, could be allocated less, or even not at all. During the inspection, it was found that due to calculation errors, 1,000 tons of cement were automatically returned.
    The Southwest Financial and Economic Committee is now preparing for the unified allocation work in the second quarter and will strengthen the inspection of material storage and use in the entire region. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 西南财政经济委员会  审核需要建设材料的计划

    西南财政经济委员会
    审核需要建设材料的计划
    西南行政委员会财政经济委员会认真审核了有关部门需要建设材料的计划，加强了统一调拨的工作，第一季度木材和水泥的供需已基本上可以平衡。
    西南区财政经济委员会在这次审核各单位原计划中，发现普遍存在着多要、早要、滥要高级材料的本位主义和计划不切实际的倾向。如西康省人民政府财政经济委员会所属建设单位的计划尚未被批准，设计尚未完成，却坚持要求在第一季调到水泥；西南钢铁局第一季原申请需要的木材，超过实际需要五千七百多立方公尺；有些文教部门原计划木材需要量竟超过其实际需要量一倍以上。一般申请调拨水泥的单位滥用高一级的水泥，一般工程都可使用三百号水泥，但计划中铺地面用的水泥也要用较高的四百号水泥。西南财政经济委员会经过严格审核修正了这些计划，同时，组织检查组具体检查各建设单位材料贮存和使用的情况。发现仅重庆一地各单位还有历年积存的木材三万多立方公尺。西南铁路系统也自动检查出木材二万八千立方公尺。因此，有些建设单位，按原计划应拨给大量木材的，便可少拨，甚至不拨了。检查中发现由于计算错误，结果自动退回的水泥达一千吨。
    现在西南财政经济委员会已在准备第二季度的统一调拨工作，并将在全区范围内加强对材料贮存和使用情况的检查。　（新华社）
