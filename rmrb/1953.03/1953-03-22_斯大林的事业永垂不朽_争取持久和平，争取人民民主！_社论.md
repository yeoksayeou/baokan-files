Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, March 20th: The latest issue of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!", the organ of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties, published in Bucharest on the 20th, carried an editorial entitled "Stalin's Cause Will Live Forever." The text is as follows:

    On March 9th, the Soviet people and all progressive humanity bid farewell to the great revolutionary thinker and fighter, the glorious successor to the immortal Lenin's comrade-in-arms and his cause, the wise leader and teacher of the Soviet people and all working people, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin. Comrade Stalin, together with Lenin, established, educated, and tempered the Communist Party, making it a great force for transforming society, and maintained the unity and solidarity of the Party ranks in the tenacious struggle against the enemy. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union became the leading force in the international working-class movement. Comrade Stalin, together with Lenin, led the Communist Party and the Russian working people led by the Communist Party to attack Tsarist rule and capitalism. Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the working people destroyed the bourgeois-landlord system and established the world's first socialist worker-peasant state, the emergence of which marked the beginning of a new era in world history - the era of the collapse of capitalism and the victory of socialism. After Lenin's death, the Communist Party, which had already united all the Soviet people around itself, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, implemented the great plan of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization formulated by Comrade Stalin according to Lenin's instructions; this plan transformed the Soviet Union from a backward agricultural country into a powerful industrialized and agricultural collectivized country, guaranteed socialist construction, and established a new economic system without crises or unemployment. Comrade Stalin eliminated the national disputes passed down from generation to generation in a vast multinational country, which was the first time in human history. Under the leadership of Comrade J.V. Stalin, the Communist Party overcame the economic and cultural backwardness of the formerly oppressed nations, united them in a unified fraternal family, and shaped the friendship of all nationalities, which has become a powerful driving force in Soviet society. Under the leadership of J.V. Stalin, the Soviet people gloriously withstood the most arduous test in their country's history—the Great Patriotic War against Hitlerite Fascism. They crushed the German and Japanese imperialist bandits, defended the freedom and independence of their motherland, and saved hundreds of millions of people in Europe and Asia from the threat of fascist enslavement.

    All the outstanding achievements made by the Soviet Union in the post-war period—the rapid recovery of the national economy, the early completion of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the prosperity of the socialist economy and culture, and the continuous improvement of the material welfare of the Soviet people—are also inseparable from the name of Comrade Stalin and the Communist Party he led. J.V. Stalin armed the Party and the Soviet people with a great program of communist construction. J.V. Stalin dedicated his glorious and pure life as a fighting revolutionary, a brilliant thinker, and a fearless leader of the people to the sacred struggle for the cause of the working class and the liberation of the working people. The death of Comrade Stalin has caused deep sorrow in the hearts of every honest worker, every progressive person who sincerely strives for peace and international friendship and ardently hates war. There is no country in the world, no corner of the earth where ordinary people do not mourn this leader and best friend of the working people. Whether holding memorial services, holding demonstrations, or stopping work, whether laying wreaths at the J.V. Stalin monument or on the graves of Soviet soldiers, whether visiting the Soviet embassy or legation to express condolences or sending obituaries and condolences, whether adorning Stalin's portrait with lovely flowers, or simply saying kind words in their hearts to mourn him—people all over the world used every possible way to express their deep sorrow and great respect. The mass character and world scale of the infinite love and heartfelt respect shown for Stalin's great genius are truly unprecedented in history. Ordinary people all over the world admire Stalin as the transformer of the world, the irreconcilable fighter against capitalist exploitation, against social and national oppression, and the heroic defender of the democratic rights and freedoms of the working people. They admire Stalin as the greatest master of leading the revolution, the most sublime political figure, the great eagle on the mountain; like Lenin, he knew no fear in the struggle, saw farther than anyone else, and was wise and decisive in solving the most complex problems. All patriots in the world admire Stalin as the liberator of all nations, and the civilization of the world was saved from the ravages of fascist bandits due to his unparalleled leadership.

    Generations of people will remember Stalin's historic contribution to mankind and will forever sing his praises for saving the honor, freedom, and independence of all nations. The working people of all People's Democratic countries regard Stalin as the great leader of the great camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. In these sorrowful days, the people of the People's Democratic countries are more closely united around the Soviet Union—their main reliance for independence and security. All good people admire Stalin as the great banner of peace, the tireless fighter who always strives for peace and international friendship. Comrade Stalin often devoted his greatest genius and energy to maintaining the peace of the people of all countries in the world. Communists in all countries admire Comrade Stalin as the world-recognized leader of the international communist movement. After Lenin's death, Stalin took on the responsibility of caring for fraternal communist and workers' parties, and often helped them to develop into fighting Marxist parties, parties of a new type. Due to Comrade Stalin's tireless work, the international communist movement has become a powerful and invincible force. All forward-looking people regard Stalin as a great scholar of Marxism-Leninism. In the fierce struggle against the enemies of Marxism, Comrade Stalin defended the immortal doctrine of Marx-Engels-Lenin, creatively developed it in accordance with new historical conditions, and enriched it with new topics and conclusions. Comrade Stalin's brilliant works, his reports and speeches, "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course," "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," and his speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are outstanding creations that are the highest peak of Marxist theory and programmatic documents for all communist and workers' parties. Comrade Stalin's classic works armed the communist and workers' parties with knowledge about the revolutionary transformation of society, and these works illuminated the prospects for the struggle of the people of all countries against imperialism and for peace, democracy, and socialism with his never-extinguishing, brilliant genius. Stalin's will, Stalin's wisdom, his fearlessness, and his statesmanship are embodied in the brilliant Communist Party of the Soviet Union he cultivated, the Party's Leninist-Stalinist Central Committee, and his loyal students and comrades-in-arms.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, with true Stalinist foresight, flexibility, and work efficiency, have taken a series of important measures to further strengthen the leadership of state and economic affairs. These measures embody the unity of the Communist Party, the government, and the Soviet people, and have been legislatively approved by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in its resolutions. The resolutions of the Supreme Soviet are to ensure the uninterrupted and correct leadership of the country's life, and to ensure the victorious implementation of the policies formulated by the Communist Party and the government in Soviet domestic and international affairs. This policy now and in the future is to tirelessly strengthen the Soviet Union in various ways, strengthen its defense forces, develop socialist industry in various ways and strengthen the collective farm system, strengthen the unbreakable alliance between the working class and the collective farmers, strengthen the fraternal friendship between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, give constant care to the welfare of the people, strive to maximize their material and cultural needs, and ensure smoother progress along the road of building a communist society. In foreign policy, the Soviet government is consistently pursuing the long-tested policy of maintaining and consolidating peace, ensuring the defense and security of the Soviet Union, international cooperation, and developing affairs with all countries on the basis of mutual respect for each other's interests. An important condition for consolidating the peace and security of the people of all countries, the foundation for maintaining peace, and the decisive factor in preventing the outbreak of a new war is the fraternal friendship between the Soviet Union and the great Chinese people, the working people of the People's Democratic countries, and the further consolidation of the great achievements of the people of all countries - the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. The election of Comrade K.Y. Voroshilov as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the appointment of Comrade G.M. Malenkov as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, the adoption of the list of the Soviet government—the Soviet Council of Ministers—and other resolutions of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union have been wholeheartedly supported by all the Soviet people. The people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union are deeply convinced of their own strength, and they believe that the Soviet government, headed by the great Stalin's loyal students and comrades-in-arms, can undoubtedly guarantee the implementation of the policies formulated by the Party and the government. The working people of the People's Democratic countries and all progressive humanity have this confidence, just like the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. Stalin's cause, Stalin's thought, will live forever!

    斯大林的事业永垂不朽
    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”社论
    【新华社二十一日讯】罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特二十日讯：二十日出版的最近一期共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”发表了题为“斯大林的事业永垂不朽”的社论。文如下：
    苏联人民和全体进步人类在三月九日向伟大的革命思想家和战士、不朽的列宁的战友和他的事业的光辉继承者、苏联人民和全体劳动人民的英明领袖和导师约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林告别。斯大林同志和列宁在一起，建立了教育了并锻炼了共产党，使它成为转变社会的巨大力量，在对敌人的顽强斗争中维护了党的队伍的统一和精诚团结。苏联共产党成为了国际工人阶级运动的领导力量。斯大林同志和列宁在一起，领导共产党和以共产党为首的俄国劳动人民向沙皇统治和资本主义进攻。在列宁和斯大林的领导下，劳动人民摧毁了资产阶级—地主制度并建立了世界上第一个社会主义的工农国家，这个国家的出现标志着世界历史上一个新的纪元——资本主义崩溃和社会主义胜利的纪元的开端。在列宁逝世后，已经把全体苏维埃人民团结在自己周围的共产党，在斯大林同志的领导下，实行了由斯大林同志根据列宁的指示而制订的国家工业化和农业集体化的伟大计划；这个计划把苏联从一个落后的农业国变成为一个强大的工业化和农业集体化的国家，保证了社会主义建设并建立了既没有危机、又没有失业的新的经济制度。斯大林同志在一个多民族的辽阔的国家里，消灭了历代相传的民族纠纷，这是人类有史以来第一次。在斯大林同志的领导下，共产党克服了过去受压迫的各民族在经济和文化方面的落后性，把他们团结在一个统一的兄弟大家庭里，塑造了各民族的友谊，这种友谊已经成为苏维埃社会中的强有力的动力。在约·维·斯大林的领导下，苏联人民光荣地经受了他们国家历史上最艰巨的考验——反希特勒法西斯主义的伟大卫国战争。他们粉碎了德日帝国主义匪徒，维护了他们祖国的自由和独立，并且把欧洲和亚洲的数亿人民从法西斯奴役的威胁下拯救出来。
    苏联在战后时期所取得的一切卓越成就——国民经济的迅速恢复、第四个五年计划的提前完成、社会主义经济和文化的昌盛、苏联人民物质福利水平的不断提高——也是和斯大林同志的名字以及他所领导的共产党分不开的。约·维·斯大林以共产主义建设的伟大纲领武装了党和苏联人民。约·维·斯大林把他那战斗的革命家、天才的思想家、大无畏的人民领袖的光辉的圣洁的一生，整个献给了为工人阶级的事业、为劳动人民的解放的神圣斗争。斯大林同志的逝世使每一个正直的工人、每一个诚心争取和平、国际友好和热烈地仇恨战争的进步人士的心中感到深切的悲痛。世界上没有一个国家、地球上没有一个角落的普通人，不在悼念这位劳动人民的领袖和最好的朋友。无论是开追悼会、举行示威、停工，无论是在约·维·斯大林纪念碑前或是在苏军战士墓上献花圈，无论是到苏联大使馆或公使馆吊唁或者寄发悼词和唁电，无论是在斯大林遗像的周围扎上可爱的鲜花，或者只是在心中说着亲切的话来追悼他——全世界各地的人民用了一切可能的办法来表达他们深切的悲痛和伟大的敬爱。对于斯大林伟大天才所表示的无限热爱和衷心的尊敬，其群众性和世界规模真正是历史上没有前例的。全世界的普通人都敬仰斯大林，认为他是世界的改造者，反对资本主义剥削、反对社会和民族压迫的不调和的战士，劳动人民的民主权利和自由的英勇的保卫者。他们敬仰斯大林，认为他是领导革命的最伟大的大师、是最崇高的政治人物，是高山上的大鹰；他和列宁一样，在斗争中不知道畏惧，比任何其他的人看得远，在解决最复杂的问题时英明而果断。世界各国的所有爱国者都敬仰斯大林，认为他是各国人民的解放者，世界的文明由于他的无比的领导才从法西斯匪徒的蹂躏中解救出来。
    世世代代的人们将记得斯大林对人类的历史性贡献，而且将因为他拯救了各国人民的荣誉、自由和独立而永远地歌颂他。各人民民主国家的劳动人民都认为斯大林是伟大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营的伟大领袖。在这些悲痛的日子里，人民民主国家的人民更加紧密地团结在苏联——他们的独立和安全的主要倚靠——的周围。一切善良的人都敬仰斯大林，认为他是伟大的和平旗手、始终不渝地争取和平和国际友谊的不倦的战士。斯大林同志经常为维护世界各国人民的和平而贡献出他天才的最大的精力。各国共产党人都敬仰斯大林同志，认为他是世界上公认的国际共产主义运动的领袖。斯大林在列宁逝世后，把关怀兄弟共产党和工人党的责任担当了起来，经常帮助它们锻炼成为战斗的马克思主义的政党、新型的党。由于斯大林同志的不倦的工作，国际共产主义运动已经成为强大的、无敌的力量。一切向前看的人民都认为斯大林是马克思列宁主义思想的伟大学者。在和马克思主义的敌人进行剧烈的斗争时，斯大林同志维护了马克思—恩格斯—列宁的不朽学说，依照新的历史条件创造性地发展了它并且以新的课题和结论丰富了它。斯大林同志的光辉的著作，他的报告和演说，“联共（布）党史简明教程”、“马克思主义与语言学问题”、
    “苏联社会主义经济问题”和他在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说等杰出的创作，是马克思主义理论的最高峰，是一切共产党和工人党的纲领性文件。斯大林同志的经典著作以关于社会的革命改造方法的知识武装了共产党和工人党，这些著作以他的永不熄灭的、光辉的天才照亮了各国人民反对帝国主义，争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争的前景。斯大林的意志、斯大林的智慧、他的大无畏的精神和他的政治家的头脑体现在他所培养的光辉的苏联共产党和党的列宁—斯大林式的中央委员会以及他的忠实学生和战友的身上。
    具有真正斯大林式的远见、灵活性和工作效力的苏联共产党中央委员会、苏维埃政府和苏联最高苏维埃，采取了一系列的重要措施以进一步加强国家和经济事务的领导。这些措施体现了共产党、政府和苏维埃人民的团结一致，并已由苏联最高苏维埃在决议中作了立法上的批准。最高苏维埃的决议是为了保证国家的生活得到不间断的和正确的领导、保证胜利地执行共产党和政府在苏联国内事务和国际事务方面所制订的政策。这个政策现在是将来也是不倦地用各种方法来加强苏联、加强它的国防力量、用各种方法来发展社会主义工业并加强集体农庄制度、加强工人阶级和集体农民之间的牢不可破的联盟、加强苏联各族人民之间的兄弟般的友谊、对人民的福利给以不断的关怀、争取最大限度地满足他们的物质和文化要求并保证更顺利地沿着建设共产主义社会的道路前进。在外交政策方面，苏联政府是始终不渝地奉行久经考验的维护和巩固和平、保证苏联国防和安全的政策，国际合作和在互相尊重对方利益的基础上对所有国家发展事务关系的政策。巩固各国人民的和平和安全的重要条件、维护和平的基础以及制止发动新战争的决定性因素，是苏联和伟大的中国人民、人民民主国家的劳动人民的兄弟般的友谊，是进一步巩固各国人民的伟大成果——和平、民主和社会主义阵营。克·叶·伏罗希洛夫同志的被选为苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席和格·马·马林科夫同志的被任命为苏联部长会议主席，苏联政府—苏联部长会议名单的通过以及苏联最高苏维埃的其他决议，都得到了全体苏联人民的衷心拥护。苏联各族人民深信自己的力量，他们相信以伟大的斯大林的忠实学生和战友为首的苏联政府，毫无疑问地能保证实现党和政府所制订的政策。人民民主国家的劳动人民和全体进步人类都像苏联各族人民一样有着这种信心。斯大林的事业，斯大林的思想永垂不朽！
