Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 1st: The International Democratic Women's Federation, in celebration of "March 8th" International Women's Day, has issued the following letter to the women of the world:

    On the occasion of "March 8th" International Women's Day, the International Democratic Women's Federation, representing 135 million women in sixty-five countries, extends greetings to women all over the world, expressing deep and sincere feelings of friendship and love. We pay tribute to all the women who gather in cities, villages, factories and offices to commemorate "March 8th" - a day for fighting for their rights, the happiness of their children, and the struggle for peace.

    The barbarous wars waged by the enemies of mankind against the people of Korea, Vietnam and Malaya, using bacteriological and chemical weapons and napalm bombs, have aroused the anger of women all over the world and filled their hearts with pain.

    Women all over the world are redoubling their efforts to stop these wars, prevent them from spreading to other countries, ensure the independence of their homelands, strive for peace and strive for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. On this March 8th, millions upon millions of women will once again demonstrate their united will and demand that women all over the world participate in the World Women's Congress to be held by the International Democratic Women's Federation in Denmark in June of this year. At this congress, women from different organizations, different professions, different political and religious beliefs, and women who do not belong to any organization will gather together to freely and amicably exchange opinions in order to jointly find solutions to the important problems that trouble them.

    Strive to win and defend our rights!

    Defend our children and families!

    Fight for world peace!

    Long live "March 8th" International Women's Day!

    Hurrah for the World Women's Congress!

    庆祝“三八”国际妇女节
    国际民主妇女联合会发表告全世界妇女书
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社柏林一日讯：国际民主妇女联合会为庆祝“三八”国际妇女节，发表告全世界妇女书如下：
    在“三八”国际妇女节之时，国际民主妇女联合会代表六十五个国家的一亿三千五百万妇女向全世界的妇女致意，表示深切的精诚友爱的感情。我们向所有集合在城市、乡村、工厂和办公室开会纪念“三八”节——争取她们的权利、孩子的幸福、争取和平的斗争的节日——的妇女们致敬。
    人类的敌人使用细菌和化学武器及凝固汽油弹向朝鲜、越南和马来亚人民进行的野蛮战争，引起了全世界妇女的愤怒，使她们心中充满了痛苦。
    全世界妇女们都在加倍努力制止这些战争，防止战争扩大到其他国家来，确保她们祖国的独立，争取和平并争取缔结五大国和平公约。在本年三月八日，千千万万的妇女们将再度表明她们团结的意志，并且要求全世界妇女们参加国际民主妇女联合会将在本年六月在丹麦召开的世界妇女代表大会。在这次代表大会上，不同组织、不同职业、不同政治与宗教信仰的妇女们以及不属于任何团体的妇女们都将集合在一起，自由地友好地交换意见，以便共同找出解决使她们不安的重要问题的方法。
    努力争取和保卫我们的权利！
    保卫我们的孩子和家庭！
    争取世界和平！
    “三八”国际妇女节万岁！
    为世界妇女代表大会欢呼！
