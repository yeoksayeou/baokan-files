Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Jakarta News: Indonesian public opinion generally expresses dissatisfaction with the US "embargo" and the policy of lowering raw material prices. "Independent Daily" said: The US "embargo" policy and the policy of lowering raw material prices have caused difficulties for the Indonesian people, and the seven million Indonesians who depend on rubber production for their livelihoods have been severely affected.
    "Abadi Daily" exposed the despicable purpose of the US "embargo" policy, saying: The US "embargo" is to make itself the only big buyer of rubber in the world that can arbitrarily set buying prices. The newspaper also said: "The embargo" only benefits the United States and does not benefit other countries. "Keng Po" commented on the US's domineering attitude of lowering raw material prices, saying: The United States has so far ignored the accusations made by raw material producing countries regarding the US lowering prices. Prices continue to fall.
    Due to trade restrictions and falling raw material prices, Indonesia's foreign trade has changed from a surplus of more than 1 billion Indonesian rupiahs in 1951 to a deficit of more than 1.6 billion Indonesian rupiahs in 1952. The artificial rubber surplus caused by the US "embargo" policy is deepening the difficulties of Indonesia's foreign trade. After the International Rubber Research Group published a report stating that the surplus of natural rubber between 1953 and 1956 would reach 420,000 tons, Indonesian Minister of Agriculture, Sadjarwo, publicly stated: This period is a particularly difficult period for Indonesia, because small-scale rubber plantations will find it more difficult to sell their rubber, and the output of small rubber plantations accounts for half of Indonesia's total rubber exports.
    Many Indonesian newspapers believe that the only way to overcome the current difficult situation is to expand trade with democratic countries. "Independent Daily" said: "For the sake of the fate of seven million people, the best thing to do is to trade with the People's Republic of China from now on." "People's Daily" listed specific figures to illustrate the benefits of doing business with China, and said: Ceylon continues to sell rubber to China in exchange for the rice they desperately need. Soejono Nikoro, Secretary-General of the Indonesian National Enterprises Association, said in an interview with reporters: The Indonesian market has become silent because of the "embargo." A lot of stock rubber has been piled up in Indonesia. He pointed out: "Trading with China and selling Indonesia's stock rubber is beneficial to the Indonesian people."

    印尼舆论反对美国的“禁运”政策
    要求扩大和民主国家的贸易
   【新华社二十八日讯】雅加达消息：印尼舆论对美国的“禁运”和压低原料价格的政策，普遍表示不满。 “独立报”说：美国的“禁运”政策和压低原料价格政策已经使印尼人民遭到困难，七百万依赖橡胶生产维持生活的印尼人民更受到了恶劣的影响。
    “永恒报”揭露了美国“禁运”政策的卑鄙目的说：美国的“禁运”是要使它自己成为能随意订定买价的世界唯一橡胶大买主。该报并说：“禁运”只对美国有利，对其他国家都没有好处。 “竞报”评论美国压低原料价格的专横态度说：对于生产原料国家所提出的关于美国压低价格的指责，美国到现在为止还置之不理。价格继续下降。
    由于贸易受到限制和原料价格下降，印尼的对外贸易已由一九五一年的出超印尼币十亿多盾变为一九五二年的入超十六亿多盾。美国“禁运”政策造成的人为的橡胶过剩现象，正在加深印尼对外贸易的困难。在国际橡胶研究组发表了关于一九五三年到一九五六年之间天然橡胶过剩量达到四十二万吨的报告之后，印尼农业部长沙灿公开说：这个时期是印尼特别困难的时期，因为小规模的橡胶园将更难销售它的橡胶了，而小橡胶园的出产占印尼全部橡胶出口数量的一半。
    许多印尼报纸都认为打开目前困难处境的唯一办法，就是扩大与民主国家的贸易。“独立报”说：“为七百万人的命运着想，最好不过的是从现在起就和中华人民共和国通商。”“人民日报”开列了具体数字说明和中国做生意的好处，并说：锡兰继续卖橡胶给中国，换得他们十分需要的大米。印尼民族企业联合机构秘书长苏约尼哥罗在对记者发表谈话时说：印尼的商场因为“禁运”而变得沉寂。印尼民间已经堆积了很多存胶。他指出：“和中国通商，卖出印尼的民间存胶是对印尼人有利的。”
