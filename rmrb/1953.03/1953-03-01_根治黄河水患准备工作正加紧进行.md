Preparations for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River floods are being intensified. As of now, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission has dispatched fifteen survey teams that have completed comprehensive surveying of the Yellow River's main stream from its source to its estuary (except for the section along the Yellow River in Qinghai Province to Guide County). They have also surveyed the Yellow River tributaries of the Jing River, North Luo River, Wei River, Wuding River, Qin River, Yi River, Luo River, and Wen River.

To fully prepare for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River floods, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission organized a large number of water conservancy workers as early as 1949 to conduct surveying, mapping, geological drilling, hydrological testing, and sediment research along the Yellow River. The ten topographic surveying teams and precision leveling teams working in the Yellow River irrigation areas, flood detention areas, reservoir areas, and soil and water conservation areas have now completed topographic surveys of more than 22,000 square kilometers and precision leveling of 20,220 kilometers. The achievements in hydrological testing are also significant. There are now a total of 209 hydrological stations, water level stations, and rainfall stations along the entire river, more than four times the number during the Kuomintang rule. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission has also specially gathered a large number of technical cadres to study and compile hydrological data. The Yellow River is a notoriously silty river. According to records from the Shanzhou Hydrological Station, the maximum sediment concentration is 46%. To solve the Yellow River's sediment problem, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission has established a special Sediment Research Institute, and the relevant hydrological stations on the main stream also regularly conduct precise sediment measurements. Through long-term testing and research, the source of the sediment has been preliminarily investigated, and the total amount of sediment contained in the Yellow River has been calculated. The analysis of sediment particles from more than 3,300 soil samples has been completed, yielding material on the laws of sediment transport. In addition, soil compaction and foundation bearing capacity tests have been carried out in conjunction with the needs of the fundamental control project.

Currently, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission is intensifying the preparations for various Yellow River control projects. In January of this year, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission specially convened a conference on surveying, mapping, drilling, hydrological measurement, and sediment research, requiring that the survey work from the Yellow River bank to the Guide section be completed this year, and that the river channel measurement work of the unmeasured 26,000 square kilometers and the continued drilling work in many places be carried out well.

    根治黄河水患准备工作正加紧进行
    根治黄河水患的准备工作，正在加紧进行中。截至目前为止，黄河水利委员会先后派出的十五个查勘队，已完成从黄河发源地到入海处（除青海省内黄河沿到贵德县一段外）黄河干流的全面勘测工作，并勘查了黄河支流泾水、北洛水、渭水、无定河、沁水、伊水、洛水、汶水。
    为了充分地作好根治黄河水患的准备工作，早在一九四九年，黄河水利委员会就组织了大批的水利工作人员出发到黄河沿线，进行查勘、测量、地质钻探、水文测验和泥沙研究的工作。在黄河灌溉区、滞洪区、水库区和水土保持区工作的十个地形测量队和精密水准测量队，现在已经完成地形测量二万二千多平方公里，精密水准测量二万零二百二十公里。水文测验工作的成绩也很大。现在全河的水文站、水位站、雨量站共有二百零九处，比国民党统治时期增加四倍多，黄河水利委员会并专门调集大批技术干部研究和编辑水文资料。黄河是世界上有名的一条多沙的河流。据陕州水文站记载，最大含沙量为百分之四十六。为解决黄河的泥沙问题，黄河水利委员会专门建立了泥沙研究所，干流各有关水文站也经常作泥沙的精密测验。经长期测验研究，已经初步调查出泥沙的来源和算出黄河所含的泥沙总量，完成三千三百多个土样的泥沙颗粒的分析，得出泥沙运行规律的材料。此外，又结合根治工程的需要，作了土壤压实和地基承载力的试验。
    现在，黄河水利委员会正加紧作各项根治黄河工程的准备工作。今年一月间，黄河水利委员会特召开了查勘、测量、钻探、水文测量和泥沙研究工作会议，要求在今年内完成从黄河沿到贵德一段的勘测工作，作好尚未测量的二万六千平方公里的河道测量工作，以及许多地方的继续钻探工作。
