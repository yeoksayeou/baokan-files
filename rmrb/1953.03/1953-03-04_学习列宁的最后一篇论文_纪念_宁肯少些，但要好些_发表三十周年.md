    Studying Lenin's Last Essay
    —Commemorating the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Publication of "Better Fewer, But Better"

    I

    The "Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" records: "In the autumn of 1922, the Party suffered a great misfortune: Lenin fell seriously ill. The entire Party and all working people felt Lenin's illness as a major pain in their own bodies. Everyone was constantly worried about the life of our beloved Lenin. However, even in his illness, Lenin did not stop his work. While his illness was very serious, Lenin still wrote several very important essays." "Better Fewer, But Better" is one of these.

    When Lenin wrote his last few essays, his serious illness had forced him to abandon his old habit of writing himself and instead dictate. Lenin dictated "Better Fewer, But Better" in early February 1923. On March 2nd, after further review and finalization, it was published in Pravda on the 4th. A few days after the publication of this essay, Lenin's illness became even more serious. After that, he remained alive and fought against the disease for more than ten months. However, after people read "Better Fewer, But Better," they could no longer read any new works by Lenin, and this essay became his farewell voice to the Soviet Union and the working people of the world.

    It is exactly thirty years since the publication of "Better Fewer, But Better." For thirty years, this last essay left by Lenin, like all his other essays in his life, has not only illuminated the road for the Soviet people, but also for the working people of the world. In particular, the Chinese people, who have always been watched by Lenin and pointed out in this essay as one of the forces determining the outcome of the world struggle, have, under Lenin's encouragement for thirty years, and under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the outstanding representative of Leninism in China, today realized the hopes that Lenin placed in the Chinese people in this essay. At the same time, some of the work pointed out by Lenin in this essay is still the work that the Chinese people must continue to do. Today, as the Chinese people revisit Lenin's teachings of thirty years ago, they will continue to draw strength and methods for building a new China from this essay.

    II

    In his last essay, Lenin first raised the issue of improving state organs. Lenin believed that "better fewer, but better" is a rule that should be followed in improving the work of state organs. To achieve this, Lenin pointed out: "We must, at all costs, set ourselves the task, first, of learning; secondly, of learning; and thirdly, of learning again" in order to reform our state apparatus.

    Lenin pointed out that one of the components used to establish new, socialist, and Soviet organs "is workers who are wholeheartedly committed to the cause of socialism. The education of this component is insufficient. They very much want to create excellent organs for us. But they do not know how to do it. They cannot do this. They themselves have not yet cultivated the knowledge and cultural level necessary to establish such organs. To do this requires culture." The lack of popular education and cultural backwardness are inevitable results of barbaric and reactionary rule. The burden that the old Chinese rulers left to the Chinese people was even heavier than that left by Tsarist Russia to the Russian people at that time. A large number of worker-peasant revolutionary cadres in China urgently need culture. Especially today, when our country's large-scale construction has already begun, it will be difficult to shoulder new work tasks without the knowledge needed to engage in construction. Therefore, conscientiously improving the cultural level of cadres has become an important political task at present.

    Our Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have always paid great attention to the work of improving the cultural level of cadres. As early as the Anti-Japanese War, the Party Central Committee pointed out in the "Decision on the Education of On-the-Job Cadres": "For all cadres whose cultural level is too low or not high enough, in addition to professional education and political education, cultural education must be emphasized, and the erroneous view of neglecting cultural education must be opposed. For them, learning culture and improving their cultural level is the central link in their entire learning." Since the national liberation, the Party and the People's Government have taken many active measures—such as establishing worker-peasant rapid middle schools, worker-peasant cultural supplementary schools, and cadre spare-time cultural schools—to strengthen cultural education for cadres, and have achieved great success. This has greatly improved the culture of many cadres from worker-peasant backgrounds.

    Lenin also attached great importance to theoretical study. He said that the Central Control Commission, "within the scope of their work, should also include the study of theory, that is, the study of the theory of the work they are striving to do, and they should also be led by old comrades or professors from the Higher Institute of Labor Organization to conduct practical learning." Lenin specifically added: "This absolutely does not mean that the 'learning' I understand refers to any school-style learning, or is limited to school-style learning." The learning Lenin referred to is closely integrated with practice and subservient to the needs of work: "Is it appropriate to combine learning activities with official activities? I think it is not only appropriate, but should be so."

    It is impossible to do a good job with enthusiasm alone without culture and theory. In the past, many of our comrades did not have a sufficient understanding of this point. They, as Lenin criticized, "always want too much to use enthusiasm and impatience, etc., to compensate (or hope to compensate) for this knowledge." Lenin pointed out that here, "simple brute force, or valorous perseverance, or any generally good personal qualities, are of no avail." To truly learn something, we must first oppose complacency: "The most harmful thing is to think that we always know something."

    Only by abiding by Lenin's admonitions to us, constantly learning, and "making sure that our disciplines do not become rigid texts or fashionable empty talk, but that disciplines truly penetrate into the body and become completely and truly a component of life," can we truly establish new state organs.

    III

    When Lenin put forward the task of improving state organs, he also emphasized the work of eradicating bureaucracy and formalism. Some of the work styles that Lenin pointed out in this essay as needing to be reformed not only exist in all of us, but are also quite serious.

    Lenin pointed out that in the era of revolution, the speed of development from the Tsarist regime to the Soviet system in a short period of time is dizzying. However, whoever truly becomes dizzy is bound to fall into the quagmire of bureaucracy. The speed of development and the achievements of our People's Republic of China in the three years since its founding have also been rapid and great, but if we have already become dizzy, bureaucracy will inevitably arise. Dizzy bureaucrats only arrange work without checking; they are only satisfied with the superficial achievements of the work and do not pay attention to the actual effect of the work; they only see the good aspects of the work and do not see the bad aspects of the work; they only pursue a large quantity and do not pay attention to quality; in short, they are easily confused by some exaggerated or even false phenomena. Therefore, Lenin warned: "We must wake up in time, we must have the necessary distrust of that leap forward movement, of all the ostentatious boasting, etc., we must consider how to check the steps of progress that we are advocating every hour, that we are carrying out every minute, and that are later proving to be unstable, not solid, and incomprehensible every second."

    Lenin also pointed out the need to eliminate the style of empty busyness. He said: "Precisely because it is empty busyness, this action only gives us the appearance of work, but in fact it confuses our organs and our minds." This style of empty busy bureaucracy is more prevalent among many of us. People who are empty busy do not investigate, do not study, do not start from objective reality, do not distinguish between urgency and importance, but act blindly. They often put forward too many and too heavy work tasks, so that the people below are busy "running around." They neither teach people to understand the tasks of the work, nor do they talk about the methods of work, but only want people to "complete the tasks." The result of this empty busyness, as Lenin said, "merely proves itself to be useless, not only useless, or even harmful." Therefore, Lenin believed that "we should abide by this rule: measure many times, cut once." For cadres, we should "teach them to learn work methods and understand work tasks."

    In addition, Lenin also pointed out the need to eliminate the corrupt and conservative style. He said: "We can often see a most interesting phenomenon: on the one hand, the greatest leap forward, but when it comes to implementing even the most minor changes, we are terribly timid." He also said: "Here... we have a courage spirit that is unprecedented in any other country, creating the greatest land revolution with worldwide significance, but at the same time, we lack the courage to reform some extremely unimportant office procedures." This style of being afraid to implement even the most minor reforms is also common among some staff in our state organs. They stick to old habits and are unwilling to accept advanced experience; sometimes they clearly see that the old methods have hindered the new work, but they always muddle along. Therefore, Lenin pointed out that we must also implement our revolutionary spirit in all aspects of social, economic, and political relations into the reform of some extremely small office procedures. He said: "Because true great revolutions are born from the contradiction between the old things, from the intention to sort out the old things and the extremely abstract will to strive for new things; this new thing should be so new that there cannot be even a little old thing in it."

    IV

    In the last part of this essay, Lenin analyzed the domestic and international situation at that time. He affirmatively answered the question of "whether a socialist country can survive," and what is particularly noteworthy is his estimate of the position of the East and China in the future world revolutionary movement. Thirty years ago, the situation of the Chinese people was just like Lenin said in this essay: "The entire East, hundreds of millions of working people who have been exploited and live almost inhuman lives, have been plunged into such a situation that all their physical and material resources cannot be compared to the physical, material, and military resources of any much smaller country in Western Europe." However, when the Chinese people were still in that situation, Lenin foresaw that the Chinese people would inevitably win. Lenin said: "The outcome of the struggle ultimately depends on the fact that Russia, India, China, etc. constitute the vast majority of the world's population. It is this majority of the world's population that has been very rapidly involved in the struggle for its own liberation in recent years, so in this sense, there can be no doubt about the final solution to the world struggle. So in this sense, the final victory of socialism is completely and absolutely guaranteed."

    Lenin's prediction has been proven by the course of events over the past thirty years and by the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, and will continue to be proven in the future. Now, after winning the victory of the People's Revolution, our Chinese people are beginning large-scale construction and moving towards the direction of socialism. The victory of the Chinese people has not only further revolutionized the East, but also united the people of China and the Soviet Union, who constitute the vast majority of the world's population, and established a permanent and unbreakable friendship. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, "This unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union, but will also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of world peace and justice."

    When analyzing the domestic environment, Lenin once again pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the working class over the peasantry and to develop heavy industry with the greatest effort. Because only a strong heavy industry can become a solid foundation for consolidating the independent position of the Soviet state and strengthening its national defense. Therefore, the task of the Party at that time was to "jump from one horse to another, from the horse of the peasants, the farmers, the poor, from the horse relying on the various savings of the bankrupt peasant country, to the horse that the proletariat strives to seek, and cannot but seek, to the horse of huge machine industry, electrification, the Volkhov hydroelectric power station, etc." For thirty years, the Soviet people, following the task pointed out by Lenin at that time, have built socialism and begun to enter communism. The road pointed out by Lenin, the road traveled by the Soviet people, is also the road that the Chinese people are going to take. Now that our country has begun large-scale construction, each of us should carry out doubly intense work and strive for our country to be transformed from an agricultural country into an industrial country as soon as possible. In all kinds of construction, we must always abide by Lenin's sentence: "We should make our state organs as economical as possible. We must completely eliminate all traces of waste in the state organs."

    Lenin's last essay has passed thirty years of struggle and testing. Thirty years of testing have not diminished its guiding significance for our revolutionary practice today. Let us learn from Lenin's teachings, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and move forward along the road indicated by Lenin, along the road traveled by the Soviet people!

    学习列宁的最后一篇论文
    ——纪念“宁肯少些，但要好些”发表三十周年
    范若愚
    一
    “联共（布）党史简明教程”中记载着：“一九二二年秋，党遭到了大不幸的事件：列宁患重病了。全党和全体劳动者都感觉着列宁患病是如同他们自己身受的一种重大痛苦。大家都时刻为亲爱的列宁的生命担忧。可是，列宁在病中也没有停止过自己的工作。列宁在病势很沉重的时候，还写过好几篇很重要的论文。”“宁肯少些，但要好些”就是其中的一篇。
    列宁在写他最后的几篇论文时，沉重的病势，已使他不得不违反亲自执笔的老习惯，而改用口授了。列宁口授“宁肯少些，但要好些”这篇论文时，是在一九二三年二月初旬间。到三月二日，经过再度审阅定稿，四日发表在真理报上。在这篇论文发表几天之后，列宁的病势就更加沉重起来。此后，他还留在人世和病魔搏斗了十个多月。可是，自从人们读了“宁肯少些，但要好些”这篇论文之后，就再也不能读到列宁的新著了，而这篇论文也就成为他和苏联及全世界劳动人民诀别的声音。
        “宁肯少些，但要好些”发表迄今，恰恰是三十周年了。三十年来，列宁最后遗留下的这篇论文，也和他生平的其它一切论文一样，不仅给苏联人民照明了道路，也给全世界劳动人民照明了道路。尤其是一向为列宁所注视而在这篇论文中又被指为决定世界斗争结局的力量之一的中国人民，三十年来，在列宁的这种鼓励之下，在列宁主义在中国的杰出的代表者毛泽东同志领导之下，今天已实现了列宁在这篇论文中所寄予中国人民的希望。同时，列宁在这篇论文中所指出的若干工作，依然是中国人民继续要作的工作。中国人民今天重温三十年前列宁的这一遗教，将会继续从这一论文中获得建设新中国的力量和方法。
    二
    列宁在他这篇最后的论文里，首先提出的是改善国家机关的问题。列宁认为“宁肯数量少，但要质量好”乃是改善国家机关工作所应遵守的一条规则。为了做到这一点，列宁指出：“我们无论如何都要定下这样革新我们国家机关的任务：第一，是学习；第二，是学习；第三，还是学习”。
    列宁指出用以建立新的，社会主义的、苏维埃的机关的成份之一，“是倾心为实现社会主义而斗争的工人。这种成份所受的教育是不够的。他们很想给我们造成优良的机关。但是他们不知怎样做法。他们不能做到这点。他们本身上至今还没有养成为建立这种机关所必须具备的知识和文化程度。要做到这点正是需要文化。”教育不普及、文化落后，是野蛮的反动统治所造成的必然结果之一。旧中国统治者遗留给中国人民的这种负担，较之当时沙俄遗留给俄国人民的还更为沉重。中国有极大数量的工农革命干部迫切需要文化。特别是到了今天，我们国家大规模的建设已经开始，如果没有具备从事建设事业所需要的知识，就势难担负起新的工作任务。因而认真地提高干部的文化程度，就成为目前的一个重要政治任务了。
    我们党中央和毛泽东同志，对于提高干部文化程度的工作，从来是给以极大关怀的。还在抗日战争时期，党中央就在“关于在职干部教育的决定”中指出：“对于一切文化程度太低或不高的干部，除业务教育与政治教育外，必须强调文化教育，反对轻视文化教育的错误观点。对于他们学习文化，提高文化水平，是他们全部学习的中心一环。”全国解放以来，党和人民政府更以许多积极措施，——如设立工农速成中学、工农文化补习学校以及干部业余文化学校等等，来加强对干部的文化教育工作，并已获得了很大的成绩。使许多工农出身的干部的文化都有很大提高。
    列宁同样也十分重视理论学习。他说，中央监察委员在“他们的工作范围内，还要包括研究理论，即研究组织他们所要致力的这一工作的理论，并且还要由老同志或由劳动组织高级研究院教授来领导他们作实践学习。”列宁特别补充说：“这绝对不是说，我所了解的‘学习’是指什么学校式的学习，或者仅限于学校式的学习。”列宁所指的学习，是密切和实际相结合的，是服从于工作需要的：“把学习活动与职务活动结合起来是否适宜呢？我觉得不但适宜，而且应当这样。”
    没有文化和理论而单凭热情是不能做好工作的。我们过去有不少同志对这一点认识不足。他们正如列宁所批评的那样，“总还过于想用热情和急性等等，来补偿（或者希图可以补偿）这种知识。”列宁指出，在这里，单单“用蛮干猛冲手段，或用奋勇坚毅精神，或用一般任何个人的优良品质，都是毫无成就的”。要真正学到一些东西，首先要反对自满：“最有害的，就是以为我们总懂得一点什么”。
    只有遵守列宁对我们的告诫，不断地学习，并且“使我们这里的学科不致成为死板文字或时髦空谈，要使学科切实渗透到机体内部，完全并真正变为生活的组成部分”，这样，才能真正建立新的国家机关。
    三
    列宁在提出改善国家机关的任务时，也着重地提出了革除官僚主义和形式主义的工作作风。列宁在这篇论文中所指出的一些必须改革的作风，在我们许多人中间，不仅样样都有，而且还是相当严重的。
    列宁指出在革命时代，在短期内就从沙皇政体进到了苏维埃制度，这种发展的速度，是令人头晕目眩的。可是，谁要真正头晕目眩起来，谁就不免陷入官僚主义的泥坑。我们中华人民共和国成立三年以来，其发展的速度也是飞快的，成就也是伟大的，可是如果自己已经头晕目眩起来，那就必然产生官僚主义。头晕目眩的官僚主义者，对于工作只有布置，没有检查；只满足于工作的表面成绩，而不注意工作的实际效果；只看到工作中好的方面，看不到工作中坏的方面；只追求数量多，不讲究质量好；总之，他们很容易被一些夸张的甚至是虚伪的现象所迷惑。因此，列宁提出警告说：“应当及时猛省，应当对那种突飞猛进的运动，对一切虚张声势的夸耀等等怀着必要的不信任态度，应当考虑到怎样检查我们每小时都在倡导，每分钟都在进行，而后来每秒钟都证明其不稳固、不坚牢和不可了解的前进步骤。”
    列宁也指出了要革除那种空忙的作风。他说：“正因为是空忙，所以这种行动只使我们具有工作的外表，实际上却混乱了我们的机关和我们的头脑。”这种空忙的官僚主义的作风，在我们许多人中间，是更普遍地存在着。空忙的人，不调查、不研究，不从客观实际情况出发，不分缓急轻重，只是盲目地行动，他们往往提出过多、过重的工作任务，以至使下面忙得“疲于奔命”。他们既不教人了解工作的任务，又不讲求工作的方法，只是要人“完成任务”。这种空忙的结果，正如列宁所说“仅仅证明了自己是无用，不唯无益，或甚至有害。”因此，列宁认为“应当遵守这样的规则：多番计量，一次剪裁”。对于干部，应当“教他们学会工作方法，了解工作任务”。
    此外，列宁还指出要革除那种腐败的、保守的作风。他说：“常常可以看到一种最有趣的现象：一面是最伟大的向前跃进，但要实行极微小的变革时却胆怯得要命。”又说：“在我们这里……具有为任何他国所未有的勇敢精神，开创出最伟大的带全世界意义的土地革命，但同时对于某种极不重要的办公手续的改革，则缺少勇气”。这种惧怕实行极微小的改革的作风，在我们国家机关的某些工作人员中，也是屡见不鲜的。他们墨守旧习，不愿接受先进经验；有时自己也明明看到旧办法已障碍了新的工作，但总是因循苟且，得过且过。因此，列宁指出，必须把我们对于社会的、经济的和政治的一切关系方面的革命精神，也贯彻到对于某种极小的办公手续的改革上来。他说：“因为真正的大革命都是从旧东西，从整理旧东西的意向与力求新东西的极抽象意志这两者间的矛盾中产生出来的；这种新东西应当新到这种程度，要使其中连一点旧东西都不能存在。”
    四
    列宁在这篇论文的最后一部分，分析了当时俄国内外的形势。他肯定地回答了“社会主义国家能不能支持下去”的问题，特别值得我们注意的，是他对东方、对中国在未来世界革命运动中的地位所作的估计。三十年前，中国人民所处的境地，正像列宁在这篇论文中所说的一样：“整个东方若干万万被剥削得几乎过着非人生活的劳动人民，已被陷入到这样的境地，就是他们所有的体力与物力都决不能去与西欧任何一个要小得多的国家的体力、物力和武力作任何比拟。”可是，当中国人民还处在那种境地时，列宁就预见了中国人民必然要胜利。列宁说：“斗争的结局，归根到底是取决于俄国、印度、中国等等构成世界人口绝大多数的这种情形。正是这世界人口的大多数，最近几年来也非常迅速地卷入谋自身解放的斗争，所以在这个意义上讲来，关于世界斗争问题的最终解决，不能有丝毫怀疑。所以在这个意义上讲来，社会主义的最后胜利是完全和绝对有了保证的。”
    列宁的预见，已为三十年来的事变进程，为中国人民大革命的胜利所证明，今后也将被继续证明。现在，我们中国人民在取得人民大革命的胜利之后，正开始大规模的建设，朝着社会主义的方向前进。中国人民的胜利，不仅使东方更加革命化起来，而且使构成世界人口的绝大多数的中苏两国人民团结在一起，建立了永久的、牢不可破的友谊。正如毛泽东同志所说，“这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”
    在分析国内环境时，列宁再一次地指明了，必须加强工人阶级对于农民的领导，并以最大程度的努力来发展重工业。因为只有强大的重工业，才能成为巩固苏维埃国家独立地位并加强其国防的坚固基础。因此，当时党的任务，就是要“从一匹马上跨到另一匹马上，由农民的，庄稼汉的，穷苦的马上，由依靠于破产农民国家的种种节省办法的马上，跨到无产阶级所努力寻求，而且不能不寻求的马上去，跨到巨大机器工业，电气化，瓦尔霍夫水电站等等的马上去。”三十年来，苏联人民遵照着列宁当时所指出的任务，已经建成社会主义并开始进入共产主义了。列宁指出的这条道路，苏联人民所走过的这条道路，也正是中国人民所要走的道路。现在，我们国家正开始了大规模的建设，我们每个人都应展开加倍紧张的工作，争取我们的国家早日由农业国变为工业国。而在各种建设中，又必须经常遵守列宁的这句话：“我们应当使我们国家机关尽量节省。我们必须把国家机关中所有一切浪费现象的遗迹铲除干净。”
    列宁最后所写的这篇论文，已经过了三十年的斗争考验。三十年的考验，并没有丝毫磨损了它对我们今天革命实践的指导意义。让我们学习列宁的遗教，学习苏联的先进经验，循着列宁所指示的道路，循着苏联人民所走过的道路前进吧！
