    【新华社新德里三十日电】出席世界人民和平大会的印度代表团团长、全印和平理事会主席、“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人赛福丁·克其鲁博士访问苏联后，于三月二十九日回到德里。到车站欢迎他的有全印和平理事会理事、德里各人民团体领导人、印度各党派的国会议员以及苏联、中华人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利大使馆代表共约五百人。他下火车时接受了欢迎者的献花。许多欢迎他的人举着绘有毕加索的和平鸽的和平旗帜和标语牌。他们高呼“欢迎和平战士克其鲁博士”、“立刻在朝鲜停火”、“亚洲人不打亚洲人”、“战争贩子滚出亚洲”等口号。
    克其鲁在车站对记者们谈到此行印象时说：“苏联和中国人民要和平，他们将永远为和平而努力。”
