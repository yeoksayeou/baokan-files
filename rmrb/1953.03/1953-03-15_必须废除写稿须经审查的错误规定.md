Reader's Letters Summary:

    The Erroneous Regulation Requiring Manuscript Review Must Be Abolished
    Editor's Note: Reader Yu Le's letter criticizes the Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative Headquarters for recently issuing an erroneous notice stipulating that manuscripts must be reviewed before being sent to the newspaper. After our inquiry to the Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative Headquarters, the headquarters has cancelled this regulation and conducted a self-criticism. We believe that the Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative Headquarters' timely correction of the error is good. However, recently some readers' letters have also reflected that the organizations they are in still have regulations that require letters to the newspaper to be reviewed. Therefore, we are publishing the abstracts of reader Yu Le's letter and the Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative Headquarters' reply letter here. We hope that all organizations will not adopt this erroneous practice of disguised restriction of criticism, so that bottom-up criticism can be fully developed.
    Reader Yu Le's Letter
    Yu Le's letter: The anti-bureaucracy struggle is being carried out throughout the country, but the Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative Headquarters issued a notice in January of this year stipulating that manuscripts must be reviewed before they can be sent to the newspaper. Item 3 of the notice states: "In order to strengthen the organization and timeliness of reporting, manuscripts from grassroots cooperatives must be reviewed by the director of the cooperative, and manuscripts from county-level or higher cooperatives must be reviewed by the department and submitted to the director for review (general manuscripts may be entrusted to a designated person for review). Except for important manuscripts that must be reviewed by the local Party committee, all manuscripts shall be sent directly to the newspaper by cooperatives at all levels."
    This notice will undoubtedly hinder the development of bottom-up criticism and provide great convenience for those who suppress criticism, and should be abolished immediately.
    Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative Headquarters' Reply
    Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative Headquarters' letter: Article 3 of our headquarters' "Notice on Strengthening Communication and Reporting Work" violates the spirit of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications." This shows that we have failed to seriously study the Central Committee's instructions. In addition to conducting a self-criticism, we hereby notify the cancellation of this regulation. In the future, all manuscripts related to criticism, accusations, and exposure of problems, etc., shall be directly submitted to the newspaper by the correspondents. We hope that everyone will boldly expose and accuse shortcomings and errors in work, and fight against all bad people and bad deeds, and the heinous acts of violating laws and regulations, in order to improve leadership and improve work efficiency. For manuscripts related to news reports, experience introductions, work summaries, etc., correspondents may submit them to leading comrades and relevant personnel for review and consultation in order to ensure that the manuscripts are truthful, accurate and complete; however, leaders of each cooperative shall not independently formulate any manuscript review system or regulations.

### 必须废除写稿须经审查的错误规定

专栏：读者来信摘要

    必须废除写稿须经审查的错误规定
    编者按：读者于乐来信批评江苏省合作总社最近错误地发出通知，规定写稿必须经过审查才能寄给报社。经我们向江苏省合作总社查询，该社已取消这项规定，并对此作了检讨。我们认为，江苏省合作总社及时纠正错误的做法是好的。但最近还有一些读者来信反映他们所在的机关还有规定给报社写信必须经过审查的。因此，我们把读者于乐的来信和江苏省合作总社的答复信摘要发表在这里。希望所有的机关都不要采取这种变相限制批评的错误做法，使自下而上的批评充分开展起来。
    读者于乐来信
    于乐来信：全国各地正在开展反官僚主义斗争，而江苏省合作总社却在今年一月发了一个通知，规定写稿必须经过审查方可寄往报社。通知第三项说：“为了加强报道上的组织性与时间性，基层社稿件须经该社主任核阅，县以上社概由部门提出意见送交主任核阅（一般稿件可委托专人代核），除重要稿件必须由当地党委审查外，均由各级社直接寄往报社。”
    这个通知无疑将阻碍自下而上的批评的开展，并给压制批评者大开方便之门，应该立即废除。
    江苏省合作总社的答复
    江苏省合作总社来信：我社“关于加强通讯报道工作”通知的第三条规定，违反了中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”的精神。这说明我们对中央的指示未能认真学习研究。现除作检查外，特通知撤销该项规定。今后凡有关批评、检举、揭发问题等方面的稿件，由通讯员同志直接投寄报社。希大家大胆揭发与检举工作中的缺点和错误，同一切坏人坏事、违法乱纪的恶劣行为作斗争，以达到改善领导、提高工作效率的目的。凡有关新闻报道、经验介绍、工作总结等方面的稿件，通讯员同志如为了使稿件达到真实、确切和完整，可以送交领导同志与有关人员核阅和征求意见；但各社领导人不得自行作出任何审查稿件的制度或规定。
