The Polish People Love National Art Traditions
　　Zou Difan

During our visit to Poland, we deeply felt the Polish people's respect for national art traditions. When we came into contact with Polish national art, we more deeply experienced the truth that Stalin revealed: that every nation has its own excellent cultural traditions. These excellent cultural traditions enrich the world's cultural treasury.

　　Zakopane Mountain Art School

　　Zakopane is a small town in the Tatar Mountains on the southern border of Poland. The mountain people mainly rely on farming and logging for their livelihood. In winter and during leisure time, they engage in weaving or embroidering tablecloths, curtains, and colorful national costumes, or use the trees, stones, and soil from the mountains for sculpture.

　　Zakopane Mountain has produced countless excellent folk artists. Their works reflect the lives of the mountain people, full of praise for labor and love for life. The works are healthy and simple.

　　After liberation, the government established a mountain art school here. The task of the art school is to improve the political and cultural level of young artists among workers and farmers and to develop their artistic specialties.

　　Generally speaking, students are allowed to give full play to their talents, freely choose subjects, and are not restricted in their creations. Only in some cases are special regulations given. For example, when welcoming the World Youth Festival, it was stipulated that everyone should create a work on the theme of peace.

　　We visited some of the students' sculptures, which were full of strong local life colors, such as sawing wood, carrying wood, blacksmithing, milking cows, and harvesting wheat. Some have already expressed new labor, such as some reliefs about workers' lives. We also saw a huge relief depicting the peasant uprising in the Sanghar region of Polish history.

　　This practice of cultivating new artistic cadres locally, in places rich in folk art, is not limited to the field of plastic arts. The cultivation and improvement of musical and dance talents is also the same. For example, the Polish Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble, which performed in Moscow last December and was praised by Stalin, is an example. They selected young men and women from the countryside of Mazowsze, a place with rich national music and dance, and trained and improved them to form Poland's outstanding national song and dance troupe.

　　Warsaw Institute of Applied Arts

　　Adapting to the people's increasing needs in cultural life, Polish artists are also making unremitting efforts to beautify the people's lives. We visited the Warsaw Institute of Applied Arts, which is led by the Ministry of Light Industry of the government. Its task is to study how to sort out folk art and then apply it to the people's daily necessities. Specifically, it is: 1. Scientifically and beautifully designing daily necessities; 2. Providing light industrial products with rich national characteristics; 3. Educating technicians to understand art, and educating artists—mainly folk artists—to understand new machine production; 4. Experts select and review the best artistic finished products; 5. Promote new methods and styles, and provide samples.

　　Therefore, the Warsaw Institute of Applied Arts extensively collected folk artworks and gathered folk artists and art experts to work together. For example, taking the patterns of women's headscarves as an example, the patterns that professional artists can design after careful consideration are still limited, and people do not necessarily like those patterns. However, the patterns collected from rural women in the countryside are very rich in color and style. Experts select the excellent ones from those fresh and lively works, and make appropriate processing to make various beautiful patterns of women's headscarves with national characteristics.

　　In the institute, we saw all kinds of samples. Such as porcelain plates, bowls, and bottles painted with national patterns, and various floral cloths and headscarves. We saw a piece of cloth printed with cutting lines. As long as it is cut and sewn according to the lines, it becomes a delicate summer dress for children, with national patterns depicted on the chest and cuffs. We also saw a garment for female workers. Female workers can wear this garment to work in the factory, but if they turn it over, it is an evening dress that can be used to visit guests.

　　Gdansk Academy of Fine Arts

　　Gdansk is a port on the Baltic Sea, formerly known as Danzig. Ninety percent of the buildings in this area were reduced to ruins in World War II. After liberation, the Polish government decided to first restore residential areas and historical sites in the city. The biggest difficulty in construction is the problem of preserving the traditional national style. Because the original buildings have been reduced to ashes, the so-called restoration work is actually reconstruction, and it must be reconstructed exactly the same as the original buildings. For example, there is a 15th-century building in Gdansk called the "Palace of Art." At that time, there were huge murals in the palace, but now most of them have collapsed and the paintings have been submerged. It is planned to re-supply them soon.

　　In this way, a series of problems arise with the architecture, such as the design of architectural drawings, the colors inside and outside the building, and the decoration of doors, windows, and ceiling walls. It is not possible for ordinary people to solve these problems. The Gdansk Academy of Fine Arts undertook this task.

　　The basic task of the Academy of Fine Arts is how to combine art with architecture, especially in restoring the classical architectural art of Gdansk. The Academy's work and teaching plan are closely integrated with the government's construction plan.

　　In the studio, we saw teachers and students designing the surface of a building, studying what colors and patterns should be added.

　　We also saw many folk paper cuttings and patterns they collected. They are copying and further creating them, preparing to use them on the walls and window cloths of buildings. In addition to folk art patterns, students also study Polish ancient paintings and even old photos, from which to absorb the national colors of ancient architecture. They want to inherit this excellent national artistic color in the new architectural patterns.

　　Veit Stoss' Sculptures

　　In the Wawel Palace (built in the 16th century) in the ancient cultural city of Krakow, the sculptures of Veit Stoss are prominently displayed.

　　At the end of the 15th century, this sculptor, of whom the Polish people are proud and honored, used the life of Jesus as the theme and vividly carved colorful serial sculptures out of huge wood. These artworks were originally displayed in a church. When the Hitler gang occupied Poland, they were all moved to Nuremberg. These art images were isolated and persecuted like political prisoners in concentration camps. It was not until the liberation of Poland that, with the help of the Soviet army, these artworks damaged by the Nazi bandits were successfully transported back to Krakow.

　　While rebuilding their country on the ruins, the Polish people have spared no effort to repair and restore the historical relics of their motherland. Sorting out Veit Stoss' sculptures is one example. This work is listed as part of the national three-year plan and six-year plan. The Polish Ministry of Culture and Art appointed experts to carry out this sorting work. A total of 330 people participated in this work, which lasted four years and took 57,641 hours. Among them, the work of restoring the original colors took 7,179 hours.

　　When Chairman Beirut met with us, Minister Shen Yanbing talked about Poland's efforts in protecting and developing its rich national cultural traditions. Chairman Beirut said very sincerely: "Yes, we have done work that the bourgeoisie did not do in the past hundreds of years." He also asked about our work in this regard with great concern, and he placed infinite hope on each other's cultural construction work. He said: "There is an idiom in Polish: 'When a fire breaks out in the forest, you can't even take care of the roses.' In the past, we were all in the revolutionary war period, and we did not have the conditions to dedicate more efforts to sorting out national culture, but now we can do more."

　　This reminded me of a piece of news I heard not long ago about British cultural relics. In London, there is a church that is nearly a thousand years old. Almost all the celebrities in British history have statues in the church. But the church has gradually become dilapidated. Churchill hypocritically lamented there, begging all English-speaking people in the world to donate a little money to repair this church. Churchill himself donated one pound first. This is a clear contrast between the people's regime and the bourgeois regime in treating cultural heritage.

　　We visited the sculptures of Veit Stoss. Although these sculptures are based on religious stories, they are full of the atmosphere of life and overflowing with love between people. According to the person in charge of the exhibition, Veit Stoss used the life of the people of Krakow in the 15th century as the background, and used religious stories to express the life of the people at that time. In the sculptures, the scene of Jesus being born in a farmer's home is completely the family of a rural family in Krakow. The wooden barrels, fireplaces, and customs after childbirth are exactly the same as at that time.

　　The serial sculptures are engraved with figures from all walks of life, all of whom are living people in the society at that time. In the figures he sculpted, not only can the bulging veins be seen on the exposed arms and legs, but also the inner expressions can be seen from the shape of the face. For example, in a sculpture of Jesus being arrested, their inhumanity can be seen from the faces of the executioners; and when Jesus was nailed to the cross, sorrow, horror, sympathy and anger can be seen from the faces of six different people.

　　In another sculpture, Jesus is with poor people, and those people have various diseases. According to Polish friends, a good doctor can tell from those images what kind of diseases those poor people are suffering from.

　　The author also paid attention to the authenticity of every plant and tree in the background of the sculpture. According to Polish friends, Polish scientists are now studying ancient plants in the 15th century and also refer to these sculptures.

　　The artworks left by this realistic technique are precisely the excellent national cultural heritage of the Polish people. They are also made into films, printed into large-format picture albums and special pages, and widely promoted to the people of the whole country to arouse the patriotic ideological feelings of the people to respect their own cultural traditions.

### 波兰人民热爱民族艺术传统

    波兰人民热爱民族艺术传统
    邹荻帆
    在我们访问波兰的期间，我们深深感到波兰人民对于民族艺术传统的尊重。当我们接触到波兰的民族艺术的时候，我们更深切地体验到斯大林所昭示的每一个民族都有其优秀文化传统的真理。这种优秀的文化传统丰富了全世界文化的宝库。
        查库邦尼山区艺术学校
    查库邦尼是波兰南方边境特塔尔山区的一个小镇，山区人民的生活主要是依靠耕种和伐木，在冬季和闲暇的时候，他们便从事于编织或挑补枱布、窗帘、彩色的民族服装，或者用山上的树木、石块和泥土，从事雕塑。
    查库邦尼山区产生了无数优秀的民间艺术家，他们的作品反映了山区人民的生活，充满了对于劳动的赞颂，对生活的热爱，作品是健康而朴素的。
    解放后，政府在这里建立了一所山区艺术学校。艺术学校的任务，就是要提高工人和农民中青年艺人的政治文化水平，发展他们的艺术特长。
    学生的创作，一般说是让他们尽量发挥天才，自由选择题材，不加限制，只是在有一些时候，才给与特殊规定的范围，如在迎接世界青年联欢节时，便规定了每人都要创作一件关于和平题材的作品。
    我们曾参观学生一部分雕塑作品，这些作品都富有浓厚的地方生活色彩，如锯木、扛木、打铁、挤牛奶、割麦子。有一部分已经表现着新的劳动，如
    一部分浮雕就是关于工人生活的。我们还看到一巨幅浮雕，是波兰历史中的山合尔地方农民起义图。
    这种就地取材、在民间艺术丰富的地方培养新的艺术干部的做法，不只限于造型艺术方面，对音乐舞蹈人材的培养提高也是一样的。如去年十二月在莫斯科演出、受到斯大林赞许的波兰马素希歌舞文
    工团就是一个例子。他们从有着丰富的民族音乐舞
    蹈的马素希地方选出了乡村的青年男女，加以训练提高，组成了波兰杰出的民族歌舞团。
        华沙工艺美术研究所
    适应着人民在文化生活上日益提高的需要，波兰艺术家们在美化人民的生活上，也正在作不懈的努力。我们曾参观过由政府的轻工业部领导的华沙工艺美术研究所，它的任务是研究如何把民间艺术加以整理，然后应用于人民的日常生活品中去。具体地说，就是：一、科学而美化地设计日用品；二、给广大的轻工业产品提供富于民族色彩的图案画；三、教育技术人员懂得艺术，又教育艺术家——主要是民间艺人懂得新的机器生产；四、由专家选择与审定最好的美术性的成品；五、宣传新的方法、式样，并提供样品。
    因此，华沙工艺美术研究所就广泛地搜集了民间艺术品，并聚集了民间艺人与艺术专家，来共同工作。譬如以女用头巾的图案来说，职业艺术家们深思熟虑，所能设计出来的花样还是有限，人们也并不一定就喜欢那些花样。而从民间乡村妇女搜集来的图案，色彩和样式却是非常丰富的。专家们就从那些新鲜活泼的作业中，挑选优秀的，并加以适当的加工，制成各种各样美丽的、富有民族色彩的女用头巾的图案。
    在研究所中，我们看到了各种各样的样品。如绘有民族花纹的瓷盘、碗、瓶，各样的花布、头巾。我们看到在一块布料上印就了剪裁的纹路，只要照着纹路裁剪和缝纫，就成为一件小孩的精美的夏装，胸前袖口都描有民族的花纹。我们又看到一件女工的衣服，女工们可以穿这件衣服去工厂工作，但是翻一个面来穿，却是一件能够拜访宾客的晚礼服。
        革旦斯克造型艺术学院
    革旦斯克是在波罗的海边的港口，过去叫旦泽市。这地方在第二次世界大战中百分之九十的建筑变成废墟。解放后，波兰政府决定首先恢复住宅区及市内的名胜古迹。在建筑上最大的困难便是保存传统的民族形式问题。因为原有的建筑都已成为灰烬，所谓恢复工作，实际就是重建，并且要重建得和原来的建筑完全相同。譬如革旦斯克有一座名为“艺术宫”的十五世纪的建筑物。当时宫内有巨幅的壁画，现在大部分都塌下来，画也被湮没了，计划不久重新补上去。
    这样，随着建筑就发生一连串的问题，如建筑图样的设计、建筑物内外的色彩、门窗顶壁的装饰等等问题，解决这些问题并不是一般人能够做到的。革旦斯克的造型艺术学院，便承当了这一项任务。
    造型艺术学院的基本任务是在于把艺术如何与建筑相结合，特别是在恢复革旦斯克的古典建筑艺术上。学院的工作方面、教学计划，都是和政府的建筑计划密切结合着的。
    在工作室里，我们看到教师和学生们正在设计一个建筑物的表面，在研究应该加上什么色彩和图案。
    我们也看到他们所搜集的很多民间的剪纸、图案，他们正在描摹及进一步创造，准备使用到建筑物的墙壁、窗布上去。除了民间的艺术图案以外，学生们也研究波兰的古代绘画，甚至陈旧的照片，从那里吸收古代建筑上的民族色彩。他们要在新的建筑图案中继承这种优秀的民族艺术的色彩。
        维塔·斯特夫查的雕塑
    在克拉科夫文化古城的华威尔宫（建于十六世纪）里，突出地陈列着维塔·斯特夫查的雕塑。
    在十五世纪末叶，这位波兰人民引以为骄傲和光荣的雕塑家，以耶稣的一生作为题材，用巨大的木料，生动地雕刻出彩色的连环雕塑。这些艺术品原陈列在一座教堂里，希特勒匪帮占领波兰时，一齐被搬到纽伦堡，这些艺术像也就如集中营里的政治犯一样被隔离并遭受迫害。直到波兰解放，由于苏军的协助，才将这些遭受到纳粹匪徒损害的艺术品顺利地运回到克拉科夫。
    波兰人民在废墟上重建自己的国家的同时，对修建及恢复祖国历史文物也不遗余力。整理维塔·斯特夫查的雕塑就是一例。这项工作被列为国家三年计划及六年计划的一部分。波兰文化艺术部指定了专家从事这一整理工作，参加这项工作的共三百三十人，工作了四年，花了五万七千六百四十一个小时，其中为恢复原来的色彩工作就花了七千一百七十九小时。
    当贝鲁特主席接见我们的时候，沈雁冰部长曾谈起了波兰在保护及发展丰富的民族文化传统所作的努力。贝鲁特主席十分诚恳地说：“是的，我们做了过去资产阶级几百年所没有做的工作。”他也很关心地问到我们在这方面的工作，他对彼此的文化建设工作寄予无限希望。他说：“波兰有一句成语：‘森林里失火，玫瑰花也顾不着’，在过去我们都在革命战争时期，没有条件献出更多力量做整理民族文化的工作，现在却可以做得更多些了。”
    这使我想起了不久以前听到的一则关于英国文物的消息。在伦敦有一座近一千年的教堂，英国历史上的名人差不多都在教堂里立有遗像。但这教堂已逐渐在破落了，邱吉尔在那里虚伪地感慨着，恳求世界上所有说英语的民族都捐一点款来修理这一座教堂。邱吉尔本人先捐了一英镑。这就是人民政权与资产阶级政权对待文化遗产的鲜明的对比。
    我们曾参观了维塔·斯特夫查的雕塑。这些雕塑虽是以宗教故事为题材，但却充满着生活的气息，洋溢着人与人之间的热爱。据负责展览的人告诉我们，维塔·斯特夫查是以十五世纪克拉科夫的人民生活为背景，通过宗教故事来表现当时的人民生活的。在雕塑中，耶稣所诞生的农家的情景，完全是克拉科夫农村的家庭，木桶、壁炉，生小孩后的风俗习惯完全和当时一样。
    连环雕塑中刻有各个阶层的人物，都是把当时社会上的活人表现在艺术品里。他所雕塑的人物，不只是裸露的手臂和脚胫可以看到凸起的青筋，而且从面形上可以看到内心的表情。譬如在一幅耶稣被捕的雕塑中，从刽子手们的面部上就可以看到他们毫无人性；而当耶稣被钉在十字架时，从六张不同的群众的脸上就可以看到悲痛、惊恐、同情和愤怒的神情。
    在另一幅雕塑里，耶稣和贫穷的人们在一起，那些人是有各种疾病的。据波兰朋友说：一个好的医师可以从那些形象中看出那些穷困的人究竟害着哪一种疾病。
    作者连雕塑背景的一草一木也注意到真实性。据波兰朋友们告诉我们，现在波兰的科学家在研究十五世纪的古植物时，还参考这些雕塑品。
    由这种写实的手法所遗留下的艺术品，正是波兰人民优秀的民族文化遗产。它们也被拍摄成影片，印制成巨册画集及专页，广泛向全国人民进行宣传，唤起人民尊重自己文化传统的爱国主义思想感情。（附图片）
