The Tengxian County Party Committee, in handling the illegal and disciplinary cases of bad elements Wang Shukun and Wang Shushen, adopted an intolerable bureaucratic attitude, allowing the bad elements Wang Shukun, etc., to exploit loopholes, commit wrongdoing, and cause serious losses to the Party and the people. In addition to severely criticizing the errors of the Tengxian County Party Committee and urging and specifically helping it to handle the matter correctly, the Shandong Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee decided to report to the East China Bureau and the CPC Central Committee for approval of appropriate punishment.

After infiltrating the Party, bad elements Wang Shukun and Wang Shushen usurped positions such as Deputy Township Chief of Kangmiao Township in Jining County and Director of the Farmers' Association of Zhaowangtang Village, colluding with another bad element, Sun Shiwen (Village Chief of Zhaowangtang Village), to act recklessly and violate laws and discipline. Between 1949 and 1951, Wang Shukun, Wang Shushen, Sun Shiwen, etc., collectively embezzled the fruits of struggle during land reform: 64 silver dollars, over 600,000 yuan in RMB, 800 catties of grain, and over 100 articles of clothing. In 1951, Wang Shukun, under the pretext of mourning his grandfather, "arranged" for farmers to give gifts through Sun Shiwen, extorting money and wealth. Wang Shukun and others usually arbitrarily oppressed and harmed the masses, for example, hanging farmer Zhao Chunfeng on a tree and beating him severely for no reason; smearing the mouth of a woman, Tian, with manure over a trivial matter; and falsely accusing military dependent Li of stealing things, beating her so severely that she could not move for half a month. What is particularly abhorrent is that this group of bad elements brazenly used their power to collectively rape women, a total of eight times from the winter of 1950 to August 1951, and induced militiamen to commit crimes with them, saying arrogantly: "Even if the higher authorities find out, a criticism is all we'll get!" In July 1951, farmer Wang Shuzhou reported the hegemonic behavior of Wang Shukun, Wang Shushen, and other bad elements. The county land reform work team immediately sent people to the village to investigate. At that time, Sun Shiying (Communist Party member), the joint defense armed forces director, and his brother Sun Shimao, actively exposed the crimes of Wang Shukun, Wang Shushen, and other bad elements. After investigation and verification, the land reform work team reported to the county for approval to dismiss Wang Shukun, Wang Shushen, Sun Shiwen, Wang Shuchi, and others from their posts and arrest them for processing by the Jining County People's Court. However, the Jining County People's Court handled the case with a bureaucratic attitude, and without a single trial, announced at a village meeting in Zhaowangtang Village that Wang Shukun, Wang Shushen, Sun Shiwen, and Wang Shuchi were "released on bail pending further processing." The people of Zhaowangtang Village were extremely dissatisfied with this.

In March 1952, the Shandong Provincial Work Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League inspected the work of the Youth League in the village. After discovering this serious problem, they reported to the Shandong Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee. The Shandong Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee immediately instructed the Sub-bureau's Discipline Inspection Commission to investigate and deal with the incident, and suggested that the Shandong Provincial People's Government People's Supervision Committee and the Provincial People's Procuratorate investigate and deal with the incident. The Discipline Inspection Commission of the Shandong Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee, together with the Provincial People's Supervision Committee, the Provincial People's Procuratorate, and the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Tengxian County Party Committee, sent people to Zhaowangtang Village to investigate. After in-depth understanding, it was proven that these crimes were true.

The Tengxian County Party Committee initially paid more attention to this incident, conducted research at the County Party Committee meeting, and decided to expel the bad elements Wang Shukun, Wang Shushen, etc., from the Party and recommend that the government punish them according to the law. However, during the discussion process, some members of the County Party Committee suspected that this was "sabotage by landlords," so they decided to let the Jining County Party Committee investigate before making a decision.

After Wang Shukun and others were dismissed, the People's Government appointed Sun Shiying as Deputy Township Chief and Sun Shimao as Village Chief of Zhaowangtang Village. At that time, the County Party Committee assigned Propaganda Department Director Liu Yanbo to assist the Jining County Party Committee in investigating and handling the case. After Liu Yanbo arrived in Jining County, he arranged to investigate whether there was "sabotage by landlords" in the case. Kong Bingguang, the President of the Jining County People's Court, even asked the trial officer to "ask Wang Shukun if he could talk about the Sun family's problems." Wang Shukun and others seized the opportunity to fabricate "facts" that Sun Shiying and Sun Shimao were "landlords" who had sabotaged land reform and suppressed the counter-revolutionary movement. The Jining County Party Committee and the County People's Government believed this to be true and sent Kong Bingguang, the President of the County People's Court, and Shi Dezhong, the Director of the County Public Security Bureau, to Zhaowangtang Village to investigate. After arriving in the village, Kong Bingguang and others also started from subjective prejudice, one-sidedly believed the words of the family members of the bad elements Wang Shukun, Wang Shushen, etc., and ignored the opinions of the masses. The Tengxian County Party Committee, based on these one-sided reflections, under the leadership of County Party Committee Secretary Li Qing, affirmed that the incident was caused by a "landlord conspiracy" and rashly decided to expel Sun Shiying from the Party and recommended that the government arrest and punish the three Sun family members.

After receiving the report from the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Shandong Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Discipline Inspection Commission believed that the handling of the Sun family was inappropriate and immediately suggested that the Tengxian County Party Committee ask the Tengxian Special District Office to first release Sun Huaitang, Sun Shiying, and Sun Shimao, and then investigate and deal with the matter. In June, the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Shandong Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Provincial People's Procuratorate once again sent people to cooperate with the Tengxian County Party Committee, the Jining County Party Committee, the Jining County People's Government and other agencies to investigate in Zhaowangtang Village. The result was the same as the first investigation. The so-called "sabotage by landlords" was entirely the subjective speculation of the Tengxian County Party Committee and a misunderstanding of the malicious lies fabricated by the bad element Wang Shukun. Sun Huaitang, Sun Shiying, and Sun Shimao, who were originally "confirmed" by the Tengxian County Party Committee and the Jining County Party Committee as "suspects in a landlord conspiracy," were not landlords at all. At this time, Wang Daohe, Deputy Secretary of the Tengxian County Party Committee (Li Qing had been transferred), and Liu Yanbo, Secretary-General (Liu was originally the Director of the Propaganda Department of the Tengxian County Party Committee and was later transferred to be the Secretary-General of the County Party Committee), and other leading cadres stubbornly adhered to their views, believing that there must be sabotage activities by landlords. Only after repeated instructions and criticisms from the Shandong Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee did they conduct a review of their mistakes and dealt with the incident, deciding to expel the bad elements Wang Shukun, Wang Shushen, etc., from the Party. The Shandong Provincial People's Court decided to sentence the two principal offenders, Wang Shukun and Wang Shushen, to death immediately (Wang Shushen is on the run and is wanted), and other related offenders have also been punished accordingly.

The Shandong Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee believes that the illegal and disciplinary incidents that occurred in Zhaowangtang Village, Eighth District, Jining County, were extremely serious, and the Tengxian County Party Committee had extremely serious bureaucratic and subjectivist work styles in handling this serious incident. In order to strictly enforce Party discipline, in addition to agreeing with the Tengxian County Party Committee to expel the bad elements Wang Shukun, Wang Shushen, etc., from the Party and hand them over to the government for punishment according to law, it also reported to the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the CPC Central Committee for approval to give the relevant personnel of the Tengxian County Party Committee responsible for handling this incident the punishment they deserved.

    滕县地委对坏人坏事抱官僚主义态度
    中共中央山东分局决定报请上级予以处分
    中共滕县地委等在处理坏分子王书坤、王书申违法乱纪的案件时，曾采取了令人不可容忍的官僚主义态度，致使坏分子王书坤等钻了空子，为非作歹，给党和人民造成了严重的损失。中共中央山东分局除了严厉批评滕县地委的错误，督促和具体帮助其正确处理外，并决定报请华东局、中共中央批准给予应得的处分。
    坏分子王书坤、王书申混入党内后，就篡夺了济宁县康庙乡副乡长、赵王堂村农会主任等职位，与另一坏分子孙士温（赵王堂村村长）相勾结，横行霸道、违法乱纪。在一九四九至一九五一年间，王书坤、王书申、孙士温等集体贪污土地改革中的斗争果实：银元六十四枚，人民币六十余万元，粮食八百斤，衣服一百余件。一九五一年王书坤借着替祖父祭丧的名义，通过孙士温“布置”农民送礼，搜括钱财。王书坤等平时任意欺压群众、残害群众，例如：无故把农民赵春峰吊在树上痛打；为了一件小事，就用粪抹在妇女田氏的嘴上；又诬陷军属李氏偷东西，打得她半个月不能行动。尤其可恶的是，这一伙坏分子竟无法无天地利用职权，明目张胆地集体轮奸妇女，从一九五○年冬天至一九五一年八月前后共达八次之多，并引诱民兵和他们一道犯罪，他们狂妄地说：“上级即使知道，挨顿批评足天啦！”一九五一年七月农民王书周告发了王书坤、王书申等一伙坏分子的恶霸行为，县土地改革工作队即派人深入该村了解，当时联防武装主任孙士英（共产党员）及其弟孙士茂等人，曾积极检举揭发王书坤、王书申等坏分子的罪行，土地改革工作队经多方调查证实，报县批准将王书坤、王书申、孙士温、王书池等人撤职，并逮捕送济宁县人民法院处理。但是，济宁县人民法院以官僚主义的态度受理此案，未经一次审讯，便在赵王堂村村民大会上宣布将王书坤、王书申、孙士温、王书池四人“取保外押听候处理”了事。赵王堂村人民对这件事极为不满。
    一九五二年三月间，中国新民主主义青年团山东省工作委员会到该村检查青年团的工作，发觉了这一严重问题后，便向中共中央山东分局作了汇报，中共中央山东分局当即责成分局纪律检查委员会调查处理此一事件，同时建议山东省人民政府人民监察委员会、省人民检察署等查处这一事件。中共中央山东分局纪律检查委员会即会同省人民监察委员会、省人民检察署及中共滕县地委纪律检查委员会派人前往赵王堂村调查，经过深入了解以后，证明这些罪行属实。
    中共滕县地委对此一事件开始还比较重视，曾在地委会上进行了研究，决定开除王书坤、王书申等坏分子的党籍，并建议政府依法惩处。但在讨论过程中，有的地委委员怀疑这是“地主破坏活动”，遂决定先让济宁县委调查后再作处理。
    自王书坤等被撤职后，人民政府即委任孙士英为副乡长，孙士茂为赵王堂村村长。当时，地委指派宣传部部长刘延博帮助济宁县委调查处理这一案件。刘延博到达济宁县后即布置了解该案中是否有“地主破坏活动”。济宁县人民法院院长孔炳光更要承审员“问问王书坤能否谈出孙家的问题来”。王书坤等人即乘机捏造孙士英、孙士茂是“地主”成份，曾破坏土地改革和镇压反革命运动等“事实”。中共济宁县委和县人民政府即信以为真，派县人民法院院长孔炳光、县公安局局长石德忠二人至赵王堂村调查。孔炳光等到村后，亦从主观偏见出发，片面听信王书坤、王书申等坏分子家属的话，对于群众的意见则不加理睬。滕县地委就根据这些片面反映，在地委书记李青主持之下，肯定这一事件是“地主阴谋”所造成，轻率决定开除了孙士英的党籍，建议政府将孙家父子三人逮捕法办。
    中共中央山东分局纪律检查委员会接获滕县地委报告后，认为对孙家父子三人这样处理是不妥当的，随即建议滕县地委请滕县专署先将孙怀堂、孙士英、孙士茂三人释放，再调查处理。六月间，中共中央山东分局纪律检查委员会和省人民检察署又再次派人协同滕县地委、济宁县委、济宁县人民政府等机关到赵王堂村调查。结果仍和第一次调查一样。所谓“地主破坏”完全是滕县地委的主观臆测和误信了坏分子王书坤恶意捏造的谎话。原被滕县地委和济宁县委“证实”为“地主阴谋嫌疑犯”的孙怀堂、孙士英、孙士茂三人，根本不是地主。此时，滕县地委副书记王道和（李青已调工作）、秘书长刘延博（按刘原为滕县地委宣传部部长，后调任地委秘书长）等领导干部仍然固执己见，认为其中定有地主破坏活动。中共中央山东分局一再指示、批评，他们才对自己的错误，进行了检讨，对这一事件作了处理，决定开除王书坤、王书申等坏分子党籍。山东省人民法院决定判处王书坤、王书申二主犯以死刑立即执行（王书申在逃，正通缉中），对其他有关各犯亦已分别予以惩处。
    中共中央山东分局认为济宁县八区赵王堂村所发生的违法乱纪事件极其严重，滕县地委在处理此一严重事件中存在着极其严重的官僚主义、主观主义的恶劣作风。为严肃党纪，除同意滕县地委将坏分子王书坤、王书申等开除党籍交政府依法惩处外，并报请中共中央华东局、中共中央批准给予中共滕县地委负责处理此一事件的有关人员以应得处分。
