    Friendship
    —People Building Anshan, Part Five
  　By Our Correspondent Lù Hào
    "You are so fortunate to be born at this time." Recently, Hou Jinkang has said this more than once to the young engineering and technical personnel.
    He is not tall, never pays attention to trimming his beard, and always wears that set of cotton overalls covered with a lot of grease and dirt. At first glance, strangers would never think that he is a capable engineer in our large construction site. He participated in the construction of the famous Harbin Flax Factory and has been working in the engineering field for more than ten years.
    Whenever Hou Jinkang says this, the young engineering and technical personnel always respond with enthusiasm and unanimously, "You are so fortunate too!"
    What happiness means to our engineering and technical personnel has become increasingly profound in the past few months.
    Now, young technicians are happily busy on the completed concrete foundation. Some of them were still college students a few months ago, and now they are very much like experienced engineers.
    The successful completion of the concrete project fills the engineering and technical personnel responsible for the foundation construction with noble concern and joyful emotions, just like a mother treating her newborn baby. On the foundation, giant cranes are transporting dozens of tons of steel rolling mill components non-stop overnight. Those world-class automated machines, painted blue, gray, and some shimmering with gold, are being installed. When Hou Jinkang sees this situation, he often feels emotional and naturally recalls his situation after graduating from university: in those dark and miserable days, life exhausted all his energy. The couple lived in a wooden house, and they had to wear leather hats to resist the winter cold at night. One person's salary was enough to pay the rent, and the other person's salary could only afford to eat dry pancakes and drink boiled water, which was considered a good life. Work and life were equally cold. Of course, large projects were done by the Japanese, and they could only build small houses. They worked alone, without any relatives anywhere. They followed the old engineers, always wanting to learn something, but often when it came to a critical moment, they would hesitate and not say anything. Thinking about the past and looking at the present, all these changes, of course, Hou Jinkang is very touched, and recently, what has touched him most is the close and warm friendship established between him and the young technicians in a short period of time; this friendship makes him feel more and more happy, as if he has fulfilled a responsibility.
    Speaking of which, Hou Jinkang did not have this feeling from the beginning.
    Although Hou Jinkang is an engineer who has worked for more than ten years, it is the first time in his life to be responsible for the construction of such a large-scale project. At the beginning of the project, he had a lot of worries in his mind. For example, the center line used to be calculated in centimeters, but now it must be calculated in millimeters. There are neither precise instruments nor such brilliant talents. To complete such a complex task, he lacked confidence. The amount of concrete work undertaken by the Second Engineering Section alone is 15,000 cubic meters. These concrete would require 1,200 train cars to load. A foundation requires 300 tons of steel bars. At that time, some technicians were afraid to start these large projects, and his own heart was thumping, feeling really uncertain. So when he saw that some young technicians in the section expressed full confidence in their work, he was simply worried about them. As a section chief, he certainly couldn't discourage everyone, but sometimes, he still kindly reminded everyone: "Relying on enthusiasm alone cannot solve the problem."
    In August 1952, a group of college students were assigned to work in the Second Engineering Section. Among them was Hong Gaoshan, a graduate of the Department of Architecture of the Beijing Railway Institute. Based on his own experience, Hou Jinkang felt that people who had just come out of school were often unwilling to do specific work, and they could not do the demanding work. In a word, he had an old view of our young people.
    Of course, when Hong Gaoshan and his classmates first arrived at the site, it was not that nothing happened. When some people first arrived in Anshan, they were so excited that they couldn't sleep at night when they saw the magnificent blast furnaces and huge buildings, saying: "Ah! The motherland is so great! The motherland is so great!" But when they were so nervous that they couldn't even breathe, without Sundays, without entertainment, having to queue up to buy tickets for meals, and having to walk seven or eight kilometers to go to and from work, and their spouses were not around, and they had to deal with sand, stones, and steel bars all day long, some of them felt that although the steel city was good, their lives were too boring; some felt that if they continued to be so busy, they could not see their personal achievements, and what fame could they make. Hong Gaoshan thought: I have been to university for four years. When I am with the workers, who should learn from whom? Before leaving Beijing, Hong Gaoshan and his wife went through marriage registration procedures at the district people's government. They originally planned to get married in Anshan, and they also heard that life in Anshan was comfortable, with two people living in a house and sleeping on wire beds at night; but when they arrived in Anshan, Anshan was experiencing a serious housing shortage due to the surge in population, and it was simply impossible to find a room. At first, his wife couldn't understand and asked him: "Shouldn't we have a home?" Hong Gaoshan replied very simply, he said: "We are not here for a honeymoon, we are here to participate in the construction of the motherland." Later, when they saw that many workers slept in sheds at night, and when they worked, they were like desperately working hard, their understanding was completely consistent. He saw that when the concrete workers were pouring the most tense concrete, they could not stop working for a moment. Even when eating, they held the pickaxe in one hand to tamp the concrete, and the steamed bun in the other. Some workers who were tying steel bars worked in the foundation. Because of insufficient lighting, the foundation emitted a dim red light. After a long time, people's eyes would blur and they couldn't see clearly. They kept working while shedding tears. This tense situation on the site was a very practical education for the young people who had just come out of school. It made everyone understand even more that participating in the great construction of the motherland is like participating in a serious battle, not a light matter.
    For us, happiness is mainly to work selflessly. There is no happiness more memorable than the happiness given by selfless work. During the construction of the No. 11 foundation, the pipelines, steel bars, and fixing frames were all set up, and a waterproof layer had to be nailed on the side of this foundation. In this place, the dense steel bars were like an iron cage, and it was difficult for even an empty person to drill in. The hammer for nailing the waterproof layer could only move within a few inches. Some people shook their heads after seeing it, saying it was too difficult to do. When Hong Gaoshan saw it, he said: "It can be done!" He took off his cotton coat and was the first to drill down, followed by many people. He climbed up and down in the steel bar layer, often with sweat and mud sticking together on his body. Sometimes, he climbed until he was dizzy and his eyes were red, and it was dark in front of him. When he couldn't climb anymore, he lay on the steel bars, closed his eyes for a while, rested for a while, and then climbed again. Especially under the foundation, it was dark, humid, and people couldn't stand or squat. Finally, after several days and nights of effort, Hong Gaoshan stayed with the workers and completed this work.
    The Second Engineering Section, which had not completed the task in July and August, successfully completed the engineering task in September due to the efforts of all comrades and due to the selfless work of comrades like Hong Gaoshan.
    This was very unexpected to the section chief Hou Jinkang. For example, he was initially afraid that the young people would not be able to endure hardship, but in fact, what these young people showed was that wherever the work was heavy, they would go there. When he first went to the site after graduating from university, he put his hands behind his back like an inspector, but these young people put on work clothes and went straight into the foundation as soon as they arrived at the site. When they worked, they had no intention of eating or sleeping. The enthusiasm of the young people surprised Hou Jinkang. He found that it was impractical to look at these young people with old eyes, with the eyes he had used to look at himself more than ten years ago. After work began in October, due to the cold weather, the construction site director wanted to add 2,000 to 3,000 cubic meters of foundation tasks. Everyone looked at me and I looked at you, and no one dared to agree. The construction site director's eyes often looked at Hou Jinkang, as if saying, "Old Hou, what do you think?" Hou Jinkang thought of so many new young people standing behind him, and he resolutely agreed to all of this task. The construction site director asked him, "Are you confident?" He smiled and said, "We can guarantee completion on the 25th."
    It was at this time that Hou Jinkang deeply felt that if he didn't catch up quickly, he would be in danger of falling behind. After October, Hou Jinkang no longer sighed and worried. The concrete pouring project of the No. 11 foundation began, just in time for winter construction. Floor slabs had to be laid on the foundation, warm sheds had to be built, and heating had to be installed under the foundation. The concrete required for this foundation had to be loaded into 240 train cars. Such a large amount of concrete required workers to work in shifts, tamping non-stop for a minute. As a section chief, he could not leave the site day and night. When he was sleepy, he would take a nap in the temporary command post on the foundation. The tense situation was like fighting a war. On the eve of the construction of that project, Hou Jinkang's wife suddenly became seriously ill and lost consciousness. There were only two children at home, the older one was four years old and the younger one was two years old. All day long, they could not eat, no one changed their clothes, and no one took care of the patient's medicine and water. The unfortunate and chaotic family life caused endless anxiety in Hou Jinkang's heart, but he did not leave the site for a step and buried himself in his work. Later, after the leadership helped him settle his wife and children, he simply lived on the construction site and did not go home.
    The smooth progress of the huge project has greatly changed Hou Jinkang's attitude towards young technicians. He no longer feels that college students are a "burden." In his work, he sees that young people are independently shouldering difficult projects and becoming his capable assistants. He has become full of enthusiasm and trust in young technicians and sincerely cares for and helps them in their work. In order to tell these young people what he knows, he has recently signed a master-apprentice contract with Hong Gaoshan and three other trainee technicians. Every week, after work, he gives them three lessons. For each lesson, he carefully writes a lecture outline, starting from the design of the flax factory to the measurement and construction of large construction sites. He often thinks when he can't sleep at night: how can I teach everyone all the things I know as soon as possible? How can I help everyone improve their technical level and adapt to the needs of national construction? Sometimes, when he is not clear about some issues, he goes to the chief engineer for advice and to the Soviet experts for advice, and then comes back and tells everyone.
    Not long ago, he learned that although Hong Gaoshan had registered for marriage long ago, he had never had a house to live in. Therefore, he vacated a room in his house for Hong Gaoshan to live in. On the day Hong Gaoshan moved in, he especially went back to help them clean the room himself, like welcoming his own brothers. The construction of the motherland is promoting Hou Jinkang and Hong Gaoshan to move forward together. They are now not only close colleagues and teachers and students, but also the best friends and neighbors.

    友情
    ——建设鞍山的人们之五
  　本报记者　陆灏
    “你们生在这个时候，真是太幸福了。”最近以来，侯晋康已经不止一次地对年青的工程技术人员们这样说。
    他个子不高，从不讲究修饰自己的胡子，身上总是穿着那套积了很多油垢和尘土的棉制服。陌生人乍一看，谁也想不到他就是我们大型工地的一位能干的工程师，他曾经参加过有名的哈尔滨亚麻厂的建设工作，在工程界已经工作了十几年了。
    每逢侯晋康说这句话的时候，年青的工程技术人员们也总要充满了热情不约而同地回答他说：“你自己也是多么幸福啊！”
    对于我们工程技术人员，幸福意味着什么，在这几个月里，大家是越来越体会得深刻了。
    现在，青年技术人员们正在已经完工的混凝土基础上快乐地奔忙，他们有的几个月以前还是大学生，现在很像老练的工程技术人员了。
    混凝土工程圆满完工对负责基础施工的工程技术人员说来，正像母亲对待自己初生的婴儿那样充满了高尚的关切和欣喜的情感。基础上，巨型的吊车在彻夜不停地把数十吨重的轧钢机部件运送过来，那些漆成蓝色的、灰色的、有的闪烁着金光的世界上第一流的自动化机器正在安装起来。侯晋康看到这种情形，他就常常触景生情，自然地回想到自己大学毕业以后的那种境况：在那些阴暗悲惨的日子里，生活熬煎着人的全部的精力，夫妇两人住在一间木板房里，晚上睡觉要带着皮帽子才能抵御冬季的寒冷，一个人挣的薪金够付房租，另一个人的薪金只能啃干面饼，喝开水，就算是不错的光景了。工作和生活是一样地冷酷，大工程当然是日本人干，他们只能轮到盖些小小的住房，做起工作来孤孤零零，到处没有一个亲人，在老工程人员身边跟来跟去，总想要学到一点东西，但往往到了紧要关头，人家就支支吾吾不说什么了。想想过去，看看现在，这一切变化，侯晋康当然都是很有感触的，而最近以来，尤其使他感触深的，就是他和青年技术人员之间在短短的时间中所建立起来的那种亲切温暖的友情；这种友情，越来越使他觉得好像是尽了一种责任似地感到幸福。
    这种感觉，说起来，侯晋康倒并不是一开始就有的。
    侯晋康虽然是一位已经工作了十几年的工程师，但担负大型工地这样庞大的工程施工却还是毕生以来第一次。当工程开始的时候，他的心里有着很多忧虑，譬如，中心线过去都是按公分计算的，现在是要以公厘为单位计算，既没有精确的仪器，又没有这样高明的人材，要完成这样复杂的任务，就很缺乏信心。单单二工段所担负的混凝土工程量，就有一万五千立方公尺，这些混凝土要一千二百个火车皮才能装得下，一个基础需要的钢筋就有三百吨，这些大工程，当时吓得有些技术人员不敢动手，他自己的心也扑通扑通，感到实在没有把握。所以当他看到段上有些年青的技术人员对于工作所表示的那种十足的信心时，他简直为他们有些担忧，作为一个段主任，他当然不能给大家泼冷水，但他有时候，总还是怀着善意提醒大家说：“光凭热情，是解决不了问题的。”
    一九五二年的八月，有一批大学生被分配到第二工段来工作，其中有个叫洪高山的，他是北京铁道学院建筑系毕业的学生。侯晋康凭着自己的经验，觉得刚从学校里出来的人往往不愿意干具体工作，而吃紧的工作又干不了。一句话，他对于我们的年青人，有着一种旧看法。
    洪高山和他的同学们在初到现场的时候，当然并不是说什么事情也没有发生。有一些人刚到鞍山，他们看到宏伟的高炉和浩大的建筑的时候，兴奋得黑夜也睡不着，连说：“啊！祖国真伟大！祖国真伟大！”但临到自己一天到晚紧张得气也喘不过来，没有星期日，没有娱乐，吃饭要排队买票，上下班要走七、八公里，爱人也不在身边，一天到晚要和砂子、石头、钢筋打交道，他们有的就觉得钢铁城市虽然不错，但自己的生活太枯燥无味了；有的觉得这样忙下去，个人的成绩看不见，能忙出个什么名堂来。洪高山想：我上过四年大学，我和工人们在一起，到底是谁应该向谁学呢？洪高山在离开北京之前，他和他的爱人在区人民政府办了结婚登记的手续，本来是想到鞍山来结婚的，他们也听说在鞍山生活是舒适的，两人一座房，晚上睡钢丝床；但到了鞍山，鞍山因为人口激增，正闹着严重的房荒，根本就不可能寻到一间房子。开头，他的爱人还转不过弯儿来，问他：“咱们难道不应该有个家吗？”洪高山回答得很干脆，他说：“我们不是来度蜜月的，我们是来参加祖国建设的。”后来，当他们看到很多工人们晚上睡在席棚里，而工作起来，都像拚命一样，他们的认识就完全一致了。他看到混凝土工人在浇灌最紧张的时候，一刻也不能停止工作，甚至在吃饭的时候，他们也是一手拿着钎子捣固，一手拿着馒头。有些绑钢筋的工人在基础里工作，因为灯光不足，基础里散发着一种黯红色的灯光，时间久一些，人们的眼睛就发花，看不清，一面落着眼泪，一面手里仍是不停地进行着工作。现场上的这种紧张情形，对于刚出校门的年青人来说，是一次很实际的教育，它使大家更加懂得参加祖国的伟大建设，就像参加一场严重的战斗，不是什么轻松的事情。
    幸福，对于我们说来，最主要的就是忘我地工作。再没有比忘我地工作给予人的幸福更使人回味无穷的了。在十一号基础施工的时候，管道、钢筋、固定架都已弄好，要在这个基础边上补钉防水层。这地方，密密层层的钢筋像个铁笼子，空人都很难钻进去，钉防水层的铁锤只能在几公寸的范围里活动。有的人看了，摇摇头，说这太难弄了。洪高山一看，他说：“可以干！”他脱了棉袄，第一个钻了下去，跟着很多人都下去了。他在钢筋层里，爬上爬下，常常身上的汗水和泥土粘在一起，有时候，爬得头昏，两眼通红，面前黑糊糊，实在爬不动了，就伏在钢筋上，闭一会眼睛，歇一会儿再爬。特别是那基础底下，阴暗、潮湿，人站也不能，蹲也不能。终于经过几昼夜的功夫，洪高山一直和工人们在一起，完成了这个工作。
    七、八月份都没有完成任务的第二工段，由于全体同志的努力，由于像洪高山同志一样忘我地工作，九月份的工程任务胜利地完成了。
    这事情很出于段主任侯晋康的意料之外，譬如他开头怕年青人吃不了苦，实际上这些年青人所表现的是，那里工作繁重，他们就到那里去。他自己大学毕业初上现场，是两只手往背后一放，像个检察官，而这些年青人，穿上工作服，一到现场就往基础里钻，工作起来，吃饭睡觉都没有心思。年青人的热情很使侯晋康吃惊，他发现自己用旧眼光，用十几年以前看自己的眼光来看这些年青人，是不实际的。十月份开始工作以后，由于天气转冷，工地主任要追加两千到三千立方公尺基础的任务，大家你看我，我看你，谁也不敢答应。工地主任的眼睛常常看着侯晋康，好像说：“老侯，你怎么样？”侯晋康想起他背后站着那么多新的年青人，他断然地把这个任务全部答应了下来。工地主任问他：“有信心吗？”他笑着说：“二十五号可以保证完成。”
    就在这个时候，侯晋康才深切地感觉到自己如果再不快快地赶上去，就很有落后的危险。十月以后的侯晋康，就再不叹气和忧虑了。十一号基础的混凝土浇灌工程开始，正逢上冬季施工，基础上要铺楼板，要搭暖棚，基础底下，要安装暖气。这个基础需要的混凝土，要装二百四十个火车皮，这样大量的混凝土，要工人轮班，一分钟也不停止地捣固。作为一个工段主任，他白天黑夜都不能离开现场，困了，就在基础上的临时指挥所里打一回盹，那紧张的情形，真像打仗一样。在那工程施工的前夕，侯晋康的妻子忽然得了重病，人事不省，家里面只有两个孩子，大的四岁，小的两岁，一天到晚，饭吃不上，衣服没有人换，病人的吃药喝水，也没有人照管，不幸的零乱的家庭生活，在侯晋康的心里引起了无限的焦虑，但是他在工地上，一步也不离开现场，埋头坚持工作。后来，领导上帮助他安置了他的妻子和小孩以后，他就干脆住在工地不回家了。
    庞大的工程顺利地进行，使侯晋康对青年技术人员们的态度也发生了很大的变化。他现在再也不感觉大学生是“累赘”了，在工作中，他看到年青的人们是那样独立的担负着艰巨的工程，成为他的得力的助手，他变得对青年技术人员们充满了热情和信赖，并在工作中切实地关怀和帮助他们。为了把他自己所知道的东西告诉给这些年青人，他和洪高山及另外三位见习技术员之间，最近还订立了师徒合同。每一个礼拜，在工作之后，他给他们讲三次课，每次课，他认真地写讲课提纲，从亚麻厂的设计讲起，一直讲到大型工地的测量和施工，他现在晚上睡不着，就常常想：怎样才能把自己所知道的全部东西早一点教给大家，怎样才能帮助大家提高技术水平，适应祖国建设的需要。他有时候对有些问题弄不清楚，就去向总工程师请教，去向苏联专家请教，然后再回来告诉大家。
    不久之前，他知道了洪高山虽然早已登记结婚，但一直没有房子住，于是，他把自己所住的房间腾出一间来，让给洪高山住。在洪高山搬去的那一天，他特别回去亲自帮他们打扫房间，像欢迎自己的兄弟一样。祖国的建设推动着侯晋康和洪高山共同前进，他们现在不但是成了亲近的同事和师生，而且变成最好的朋友和邻居了。
