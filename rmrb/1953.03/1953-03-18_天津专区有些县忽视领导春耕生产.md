    Some Counties in Tianjin Special District Neglect Leadership of Spring Plowing Production
    [This Newspaper News] In Tianjin Special District, Hebei Province, some county leading cadres have not yet paid attention to leading spring plowing work. Spring plowing production in these areas is still sluggish. When Renqiu County convened a people's representative conference, it decided to focus on implementing the Marriage Law and the system of land tilling on behalf of soldiers’ families, placing spring plowing production in third place, and did not seriously discuss production work. The cadre force invested in spring plowing production in various counties is very weak. For example, the Baodi County Production Office has only two people, one of whom also does other work. Since the beginning of spring production, the counties have rarely sent people to the countryside for inspection. Some district-level cadres have a vague understanding of leading agricultural production as the overriding central task at present, and no one is leading production. Nine out of the ten district heads in Baodi County do not even know the production situation in one village. Because county and district cadres relaxed their leadership, spring plowing production fell into a state of free flow. For example, Renqiu County is a dryland area, and it is very important to develop water conservancy work. Last winter, the higher authorities used great efforts to train eighteen classes of cone well teams. Because the leadership did not deeply mobilize the masses to dig wells, only three sets of well-digging tools have been loaned out so far. Baodi County is a disaster area and has determined to plant 100,000 mu of spring wheat, but because the county has not sent cadres to lead the work, it can only complete 60,000 mu.
    The fundamental reason why some counties in Tianjin Special District neglect leadership of spring plowing is that the leading cadres do not truly recognize the importance of doing a good job in agricultural production for completing this year's production increase task and promoting national economic construction. When there are many work tasks, they are busy with other work and relax their leadership of production work. They do not put production work in the primary position and make other work revolve around production work, but instead reverse the priorities. As a result, spring plowing production is affected.
    After discovering this situation, the Tianjin Administrative Office and the Tianjin District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have urgently instructed all counties to quickly reverse the phenomenon of neglecting leadership of agricultural production, emphasizing that all work should revolve around spring plowing production. All counties must organize forces to go to the countryside for inspection, help districts and villages overcome specific difficulties, and ensure that spring plowing work is done well.

### 天津专区有些县忽视领导春耕生产

    天津专区有些县忽视领导春耕生产
    【本报讯】河北省天津专区有些县的领导干部，还没有重视领导春耕工作，这些地区的春耕生产到现在还是冷冷清清。任邱县召开各界人民代表会议时，确定以贯彻婚姻法、代耕为中心，把春耕生产列为第三，对生产工作没有认真进行讨论。各县投入春耕生产的干部力量很薄弱，像宝坻县生产办公室只有二人，其中还有一人兼做其他工作，从春季生产开始，各县很少抽人下乡进行检查。有些区级干部对领导农业生产是当前压倒一切的中心任务的认识很模糊，无人领导生产。宝坻县十个区的区长，就有九个人连一个村的生产情况都摸不清。因为县区干部放松领导，春耕生产陷于自流状态。如任邱县是旱田区，开展水利工作很重要，去年冬季上级用很大力量训练了十八班锥井班，因为领导上没有深入发动群众打井，现在只贷下三套打井工具。宝坻县是灾区，确定种春麦十万亩，因为县里没有派干部去领导，只能完成六万亩。
    天津专区一些县份忽视领导春耕的根本原因，是领导干部还不真正认识搞好农业生产对于完成今年的增产任务和推进国家经济建设的重要意义。在工作任务多时，就忙于其他工作，放松领导生产工作，不是把生产工作放在首要地位，使其他工作围绕生产工作去进行，而是轻重倒置。结果使春耕生产受到影响。
    天津专署、中共天津地委发现这种情况后，已紧急指示各县迅速扭转忽视领导农业生产的现象，强调一切工作围绕春耕生产来进行。各县都要组织力量下乡进行检查，帮助区村克服具体困难，保证把春耕工作做好。
