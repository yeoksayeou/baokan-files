Xinhua News Agency, 17th - The Central Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law held its second meeting on March 12th. Participants included Liu Jingfan, Peng Zemin, Shi Liang, Yang Zhihua, Hu Keshi, Wang Yunsheng, Li Jiansheng, Shao Zonghan, Chen Shaoxian, Xu Guangping, Liang Xi, Yang Weiyu, Lei Jieqiong, Liu Qingyang, Lai Ruoyu, Luo Shuzhang, Tan Tiwu, and relevant staff, totaling more than twenty people. The meeting began with a report by Wang Yuechen, Director of the Office of the Central Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law, on the progress of preparatory work for the implementation of the Marriage Law movement in various regions over the past period, as well as suggestions for future work. The committee members discussed this report, and finally, Liu Jingfan, Deputy Director of the Central Committee for the Implementation of the Marriage Law, delivered a summarizing speech.

During the past period, key experimental work on the implementation of the Marriage Law conducted in rural areas, neighborhoods, and factories across the country has yielded some results and gained some experience. In areas where this work was carried out well, the masses' awareness has been greatly raised. Regardless of gender or age, people have recognized the harm of the feudal marriage system of forced arranged marriages and male chauvinism, and the benefits of the new marriage system of freedom of marriage and equality between men and women. The masses generally support the Marriage Law. Many families with previously poor relationships between husband and wife, and between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, have also improved their relationships through the help and mediation of local cadres and work teams. During the key experimental work in various regions, it was also found that some cadres, due to underestimating the feudal ideas and feudal customs in the marriage system left over from the old society, and due to a vague understanding of the nature, requirements, principles, and policies of this movement, had developed impetuous emotions, attempted to solve all problems in one movement, and adopted some incorrect practices, which resulted in some confusion and panic among the masses. This deviation has been corrected by the supplementary instructions on the work of the Marriage Law Movement Month issued by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on February 18th.

The meeting examined the current state of preparatory work for the launch of the Marriage Law movement in various regions. Since the issuance of the supplementary instructions by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, various regions have not only sent responsible cadres to convey the instructions or transferred cadres for centralized study, but also actively carried out the following tasks: 1. Revising plans in accordance with the spirit of the supplementary instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the actual conditions of various regions, or issuing supplementary instructions; 2. Dispatching inspection teams to conduct key inspections of preparatory work in various regions, with some regions organizing cadres to re-conduct key experiments to gain experience; 3. Paying more attention to the work of training cadres, with some regions having completed the training of cadres and providing supplementary lessons based on the spirit of the supplementary instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The meeting believes that the above measures are very necessary to steadily carry out the Marriage Law movement and healthily lead the movement to a climax, and various regions must do these preparatory works well to ensure the smooth development of the movement.

The meeting emphasized that after the issuance of the supplementary instructions by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, some cadres had developed an attitude of attempting to handle things carelessly due to misinterpreting the instructions. This emotion stemmed from two kinds of thinking: some people originally had impetuous emotions and attempted to solve all problems in this movement. After reading the supplementary instructions, they felt that propaganda did not solve the problem and therefore became discouraged; others originally had feudal remnants of thought and conservative ideas. They originally held a negative attitude towards the movement, fearing that it would hinder production and affect other work. After reading the supplementary instructions, they mistakenly believed that the movement did not need to be carried out in a big way and that it would be over after a perfunctory propaganda effort. Therefore, in some places, they stopped the preparatory work that was underway, some even transferred cadres back, and some prepared to give a report to the masses during the Movement Month and complete the task. To this end, the meeting unanimously agreed that the large-scale movement to publicize and implement the Marriage Law must be resolutely carried out in accordance with the spirit of the supplementary instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; the expected goals must also be resolutely achieved; and at the same time, the correct principles must be resolutely implemented to healthily lead the movement to a climax. Any impetuous emotions are wrong, and the emotion of dealing with things carelessly is also incorrect, and both must be corrected. However, since the spring plowing season has arrived, the propaganda movement for the implementation of the Marriage Law in various regions must be closely combined with production.

The meeting unanimously agreed that the timing of the start of the large-scale publicity movement for the Marriage Law should first be determined by whether the work of training cadres has been done well. Various regions must have sufficient time to carry out this work, so that cadres can draw a clear line between the old and new marriage systems, clarify the principles, policies, and practices of the movement, and conduct inspections of the implementation of the Marriage Law on this basis. If the cadres at the county, district, and grassroots levels can be truly well-trained, the basic problems in the movement will be solved. However, according to the current situation, the development of the work of training cadres in various regions is very uneven. In some regions where the training work has ended earlier, the propaganda movement can begin immediately; however, most regions only began large-scale training of grassroots cadres in March, so the propaganda movement in these regions will have to be postponed. The meeting emphasized that in order to ensure that cadres truly understand and master the principles and policies of the movement and ensure that no deviations occur in the movement, the widespread publicity activities can only begin after the cadres have been well-trained.

The meeting also studied how to strengthen leadership and further organize propaganda forces, and strengthen propaganda activities.

    中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会举行会议
    检查贯彻婚姻法运动的准备工作
    会议着重指出必须纠正干部中的潦草了事的情绪
     【新华社十七日讯】中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会在三月十二日举行了第二次会议。参加这次会议的有刘景范、彭泽民、史良、杨之华、胡克实、王芸生、李健生、邵宗汉、陈劭先、许广平、梁希、杨卫玉、雷洁琼、刘清扬、赖若愚、罗叔章、谭惕吾等及有关工作人员二十余人。会议首先由中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会办公室主任王悦尘报告了过去一个时期各地进行贯彻婚姻法运动准备工作的情况以及今后工作的意见，与会委员对这一报告进行了讨论，最后由中央贯彻婚姻法运动委员会副主任刘景范作了总结性的发言。
    过去这一时期全国各地在农村、街道、工厂中所进行的贯彻婚姻法的重点试验工作，已收到一些成绩，取得若干经验。凡是这一工作进行得较好的地区，群众觉悟有很大提高，无论男女老少，都认清了强迫包办、男尊女卑的封建婚姻制度的害处与婚姻自由、男女平等的新婚姻制度的好处，群众普遍拥护婚姻法。许多原来夫妻、婆媳关系不好的家庭，经过当地干部和工作组的帮助调解，也都改善了关系。各地在重点试验工作中，还发现在一部分干部中，由于对旧社会遗留下来的在婚姻制度上的封建思想和封建习惯估计不足，由于对这次运动的性质、要求、方针、政策认识模糊，因而有急躁情绪，企图在一次运动中解决一切问题，采取了一些不正确的作法，结果在群众中引起了一些混乱和恐慌。这种偏向，已由于中共中央在二月十八日发布了关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示而得到纠正。
    会议检查了目前各地正在进行的开展贯彻婚姻法运动准备工作的情况。自中共中央补充指示发布后，各地除分别派出负责干部进行传达或抽调干部集中学习外，还积极进行了下列几项工作：一、按照中共中央补充指示精神和各地实际情况，重新修订计划，或发出补充指示；二、派出检查组对各地准备工作进行重点检查，有些地区正组织干部重新进行重点试验，取得经验；三、更加重视训练干部的工作，有些地区已经训练完毕的干部，又根据中共中央补充指示精神进行补课。会议认为：上述这些工作，对于稳步开展贯彻婚姻法运动，把运动健康地引向高潮，是十分必要的措施，各地必须把这些准备工作做好，才能保障运动的顺利开展。
    会议着重指出：在中共中央补充指示发下以后，在一部分干部中产生了由于曲解这个指示而企图潦草从事的情绪。这种情绪是由两种思想出发的：一种人原来抱有急躁情绪，企图在这次运动中解决一切问题，他们看了补充指示后，认为宣传不解决问题，因此就泄了气；另一种人是原来就存在封建残余思想和保守思想，他们原来对运动就抱着消极态度，怕妨碍生产和影响其他工作，他们看了补充指示后，就错误地以为运动不用大张旗鼓地开展了，草率宣传一下就完了，因此在个别地方就停止了正在进行的准备工作，有的甚至将干部调回，有的准备在运动月中向群众作个报告，完成任务了事。为此，会议一致认为：大规模宣传贯彻婚姻法的运动必须依照中共中央补充指示的精神坚决地进行；预期的目的也必须坚决地达到；同时也必须坚决地贯彻正确的方针，把运动健康地引向高潮，任何急躁情绪都是错误的，潦草了事的情绪也是不对的，都必须加以纠正。但由于春耕季节已届，各地贯彻婚姻法的宣传运动，必须紧密地结合着生产去进行。
    会议一致认为：大规模宣传婚姻法的运动何时开始，首先要看训练干部的工作是否做好而定，各地必须有充分的时间来进行这项工作，使干部在新旧婚姻制度方面划清界限，明确运动的方针政策及作法，并在这一基础上进行对于婚姻法执行情况的检查。如能真正把县、区及基层干部训练好，就是解决了运动中的基本问题。但按目前情况看来，各地训练干部的工作发展很不平衡，有些训练工作结束较早的地区，宣传运动即可以开始；但大部分地区在三月份才开始大规模训练基层干部，因此这些地区的宣传运动就不能不推迟进行。会议强调指出：为了使干部真正了解和掌握运动的方针、政策，保证在运动中不出偏差，一定要把干部训练好以后，才能开始广泛的宣传活动。
    会议还研究了如何加强领导及进一步组织宣传力量、加强宣传活动等问题。
