Lessons from the Wang Zhenhai Crime Incident

The serious violations of law and discipline by Wang Zhenhai, a counter-revolutionary element—former secretary of the CCP Hebei Province Ding County Local Committee—who, relying on his position and authority, retaliated against and framed Communist Party member Li Xiaoliu, have been finally dealt with after extensive investigation and verification by the North China Bureau Discipline Inspection Commission. Our Party has expelled Wang Zhenhai, this incorrigible anti-Party element, from the Party and handed him over to the government for legal punishment; the Ding County Local Committee, which treated this serious violation of law and discipline with an extremely erroneous, corrupt, compromising, and liberal attitude, has been given a partial reorganization; and the Hebei Provincial Committee, which treated this serious incident with a bureaucratic and conciliatory attitude, has been criticized. Our Party's handling of this incident is completely correct and just.

Wang Zhenhai's descent into an incorrigible anti-Party and anti-people criminal was not accidental for him personally. He was an extreme individualist and selfishly motivated person. Comrade Liu Shaoqi once pointed out that within our Party there are a few people with relatively strong individualism and selfish ideas. Such people "put personal interests before the interests of the Party when solving various specific problems; or they are always worried about their personal gains and losses, calculating their personal interests; or they engage in corruption and use Party work to achieve some personal purpose; or they use the pretext of principle issues, the pretext of the big hat of Party interests to retaliate against their personal hatred for other comrades." ("On the Self-Cultivation of Communists") Wang Zhenhai is a typical example of such a person. His descent into an anti-Party and anti-people criminal was precisely the result of the serious development of his strong individualism and selfish ideas. The seriousness of Wang Zhenhai's crimes lies in his reliance on the position and authority entrusted to him by the Party and the people to achieve his anti-Party and anti-people criminal goals. Originally, the higher the position and the greater the power that the Party and the people entrust to us, the greater the trust and expectations of the masses of the people, and therefore the more we should increase our responsibility, and the more we should conscientiously and cautiously do all the work entrusted to us by the Party and the people, and we must not have any privileged ideas or acts of bullying. But Wang Zhenhai did not implement this principle; he wanted to make the interests of the Party and the people subordinate to his personal interests, and the more the Party and the people entrusted him with power, the more he relied on his power to violate laws and discipline. It was under these circumstances that he completely betrayed the position of the Party and the people in dealing with the Communist Party member Li Xiaoliu, stubbornly stood on the position of his wife, family, and relatives, and relied on his position as the secretary of the local Party committee to carry out private and cruel revenge against the Communist Party member Li Xiaoliu, who had violated the interests of his wife, family, and relatives in leading the peasant struggle. The ultimate goal of his revenge was to put Li Xiaoliu to death. Wang Zhenhai thought that he was a relatively senior cadre of the Party and could do whatever he wanted. But the final facts proved that those who rely on their power to oppose the masses of the people cannot but be sanctioned by Party discipline and state law. The discipline of the Party and the laws of the people's government can only safeguard the interests of the masses of the people, and can never safeguard violations of law and discipline.

From this, we should draw the lesson that all Party members must not have selfish motives and individualism, and must not put their personal interests above the interests of the Party and the people. We must do our best to eliminate all kinds of bad influences from all aspects, especially from our own surroundings. Communist Party members must never have privileged ideas, and can only be servants of the people, not masters of the people. The heavier the responsibility entrusted to us by the Party and the people, the more we should strictly demand ourselves, make our personal interests subordinate to the interests of the Party and the people, and work selflessly for the Party and the people. The result of all selfishness and individualism is to harm the interests of the Party and the people, to commit crimes, and to ruin one's reputation. And our Party at this time should always be vigilant about the harm of selfishness and individualism among Party member cadres to the Party, resolutely fight against various wrong ideas and acts of violating laws and discipline by relying on their positions, and timely cleanse those incorrigible elements who destroy the Party's principles and endanger the Party's cause due to serious selfishness and violations of law and discipline from the Party, in order to maintain and continuously improve the Party's prestige among the masses of the people.

The reason why Wang Zhenhai committed such crimes and failed to be stopped in time is that the majority of comrades in the original Ding County Local Committee bear serious political responsibility. In early 1950, when Wang Zhenhai had just started his criminal actions, the Ding County Local Committee had already discovered his serious anti-Party nature, but at that time, in addition to a few comrades who protested and fought against him afterward, the majority of comrades did not express righteous indignation at Wang Zhenhai's anti-Party behavior, did not launch a resolute struggle against him, and did not report to the higher Party committee, but repeatedly adopted a corrupt liberal attitude, letting it go, which in practice indulged Wang Zhenhai's criminal behavior. They were either indifferent, holding the attitude of "getting by" and "better to do less than more"; or they dared not break the personal relationship, dared not offend others, fearing that this would bring "disadvantage" to themselves and cause others' counter-criticism; or they feared inner-Party struggle and self-criticism, believing that carrying out inner-Party struggle to overcome all bad phenomena in the Party would hinder the Party's "unity," and therefore perfunctorily dealt with bad phenomena, adopting a compromising and moderate attitude; some even took the opportunity of inner-Party differences, watched the wind, deliberately concealed or diluted the errors of those who "held power" but did bad things, and attacked those comrades who adhered to the truth and spoke out righteously. They haggled over personal gains and losses, did not reveal problems, did not adhere to the truth, dared not fight against bad people and bad things, and disregarded the Party's principles and the people's interests. What is especially intolerable is that after personally investigating and clarifying the truth, they still continued to adopt a compromising and moderate attitude on such major principled issues, intentionally writing false reports to the provincial committee that confused right and wrong and concealed Wang Zhenhai's mistakes. May I ask where these leading Communist Party members' most basic Party spirit has gone? It can be asserted that if the majority of comrades in the original Ding County Local Committee had not adopted a compromising and moderate attitude on this issue, but had taken measures as early as possible to put the issue on the table, and had launched a debate in accordance with the Party's principles, and had truthfully reflected the issues in the debate to the higher authorities, then Wang Zhenhai's anti-Party crimes would not have developed to such a serious extent, and could have been stopped in time, and the damage caused by this anti-Party crime to the Party and the people's cause would not have developed to such a serious extent, and could have been saved in time.

From this, we should draw the lesson that our Party comrades, especially leading comrades, must not adopt a corrupt liberal attitude or a "moderate" attitude that obliterates principles toward any principled errors and various bad phenomena. Any comrade, especially leading comrades, should adhere to the principle of struggle against any kind of error that violates the Party's principles, against all bad people and bad things, no matter who they are. Whoever attempts to sacrifice the Party's principles to achieve personal despicable purposes, the Party's treatment of them is to prevent them from achieving such personal purposes. The Party's leading organs should timely reveal various wrong issues, put all policy and principled issues and differences on the table, and overcome all bad phenomena in the Party with criticism and self-criticism and correct inner-Party struggle, not allowing knowing and not asking, not struggling, not allowing adopting a vulgar perfunctory attitude. At present, this vulgar perfunctory attitude among leading cadres is not uncommon, and must be resolutely eliminated.

The other responsible cadres of the original Ding County Local Committee (such as Comrade Fan Wenxing, the former deputy secretary of the Ding County Local Committee) had revealed this case to the Hebei Provincial Committee. If the Hebei Provincial Committee and the Discipline Inspection Commission had not adopted a bureaucratic attitude after the incident was revealed, but had adopted a responsible attitude and immediately dealt with it seriously, then this error could also have been appropriately stopped, bad people, bad things, and chaotic phenomena could have been eliminated as early as possible, and the Party's influence could have been salvaged. However, the Hebei Provincial Committee and the Discipline Inspection Commission failed to do so. After receiving Comrade Fan Wenxing's first accusation, the Hebei Provincial Committee and the Discipline Inspection Commission did not pay due attention, neither sending people to thoroughly investigate, nor ordering the local committee to be responsible for finding out the truth, but simply wrote a letter ordering Wang Zhenhai himself to make a self-criticism. Wang Zhenhai refused to make a self-criticism, and the Ding County Local Committee wrote a false report to the Provincial Committee, and the Provincial Committee actually believed it to be true, without taking any measures. By March 1952, when Comrade Fan Wenxing again revealed this case to the Provincial Committee, although the Provincial Committee Discipline Inspection Commission sent people to the local area to investigate, they were still not prepared to effectively clarify right and wrong and solve the problem, and continued to adopt a perfunctory attitude, hastily ending it with the so-called "settled case" method, using the excuse that the case was complicated and difficult to clarify for a while. After the Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan anti-Party incident, the Hebei Provincial Committee did not learn the lessons it should have learned, and made the same kind of mistake in handling the Wang Zhenhai incident. From the beginning, they adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards the obvious differences of opinion among the main responsible comrades of the Ding County Local Committee, and did not take the necessary measures to find out the facts and express their principled opinions, allowing the matter to develop to an extremely serious point. This is the inevitable result of the weak political and ideological leadership of the Hebei Provincial Committee, and the inevitable result of adopting a conciliatory attitude towards the mistakes of cadres, especially senior cadres. For the mistakes of cadres, especially senior cadres, using the excuses of "having made contributions in the past," "having performed well in the past," "looking honest," "generally speaking, still a good cadre," etc., without being vigilant, without seriously implementing inspection, and when the problem is placed in front of them, still relying only on their own extremely superficial old impressions, thinking "this person wouldn't do this, right?" thinking that things "probably wouldn't get to this point, right?" and therefore still not determined to clarify this matter, still being careless and not drawing a conclusion, this is extremely wrong. This is a manifestation of serious bureaucracy in leadership style.

From this, we should draw the lesson that leading organs must not adopt a bureaucratic attitude towards any principled errors and differences among cadres, and should clearly express their principled opinions and make correct conclusions in a timely manner; we must strengthen ideological leadership and be diligent in inspection, and fight against all errors that violate the Party's policies and principles and the conciliatory attitude towards such errors among cadres. This is the only correct way to educate and save cadres who have made mistakes. The treatment of any mistakes made by any cadre can only be based on the Party's principles, and not on the cadre's position; it should only be based on facts, and not on subjective impressions, otherwise it is wrong. Facts have repeatedly proved that the bureaucracy of leading organs is enough to kill people, bury cadres, and weaken the Party's combat effectiveness. Relaxing the opposition to bureaucracy is allowing crimes that endanger the cause of the Party and the people to go unpunished, which is of course not allowed.

The criminal incident of the anti-Party element Wang Zhenhai has been concluded, but the lessons this incident has given us cannot be forgotten. May all Party comrades remember these lessons!

    王振海犯罪事件给我们的教训
    反党分子王振海——中共河北省定县地方委员会前任书记——倚仗职权报复陷害共产党员李小六的严重违法乱纪案件，经过华北局纪律检查委员会多方面调查和对证以后已经作了最后的处理。我们党已将王振海这个不可救药的反党分子从党内驱逐出去，并交由政府依法惩办；对于以极端错误的腐朽的调和主义、自由主义态度对待这一严重违法乱纪事件的定县地方委员会，给以部分改组的处分；对于以官僚主义的姑息态度对待这一严重事件的河北省委员会，给以指责。我们党对这一事件的处理，是完全正确的、公正的。
    王振海之所以堕落成为不可救药的反党反人民的犯罪分子，对于他本人来说，并不是偶然的。他是一个极端的个人主义和自私自利的分子。刘少奇同志曾经指出在我们党内有少数带着比较浓厚的个人主义和自私自利思想的人，这种人“在解决各种具体问题时把个人利益摆在前面，而把党的利益摆在后面；或者他对于个人总是患得患失，计较他个人的利益；或者假公营私，藉着党的工作去达到他私人的某种目的；或者藉口原则问题、藉口党的利益的大帽子去报复他私人对其他同志的仇恨。”（“论共产党员的修养”）王振海正是这种人的典型。他之所以堕落成为反党反人民的犯罪分子，正是由于他的浓厚的个人主义和自私自利思想严重发展的结果。王振海罪恶的严重性在于他倚仗党和人民所交给他的职权来达到他反党反人民的犯罪目的。本来，党和人民所交给我们的职位愈高、权力越大，只是表示人民群众对我们的信任越大、期望越高，因而也就越加加重了我们的责任，我们就愈应该兢兢业业地、谦虚谨慎地作好党和人民所交给自己的一切工作，不能有任何特权思想和仗势欺人的行为。但王振海并不执行这项原则，他要使党和人民的利益服从于他私人的利益，党和人民交给他的职权愈重，他就愈加倚仗权势违法乱纪。正是在这种情况下，他才在对待共产党员李小六的问题上，完全背叛党和人民的立场，固执地站到他的妻子、家庭和亲戚的立场，倚仗他作为党的地方委员会书记的职权，对于在领导农民斗争中触犯他的妻子、家庭、亲戚的利益的共产党员李小六，实行私人的残酷的报复，其报复的最后目的是要置李小六于死地。王振海自以为是党的比较高级的干部，就可以这样无法无天。但最后的事实证明，倚仗权势和人民群众作对的，就不能不受到党纪国法的制裁。党的纪律和人民政府的法律只能维护人民群众的利益，而永远不能维护违法乱纪的罪行。
    由此应当得出教训：一切党员都不能有私心和个人主义，不能把自己的私人利益摆在党和人民的利益之上，必须竭力排除来自一切方面特别是来自自己身边的各种坏影响。共产党员决不能有特权思想，只能当人民的勤务员，不能作人民的老爷。党和人民托付给自己的责任愈重，就愈应该严格要求自己，使自己私人的利益服从于党和人民的利益，忘我地为党为人民进行工作。一切自私自利和个人主义发展的结果，就是损害党和人民的利益，就是犯罪，就是身败名裂。而我们党在今天这个时期则应时刻警惕党员干部中自私自利和个人主义思想对于党的危害，时刻同各种错误思想和倚仗职权违法乱纪的行为作坚决斗争，并及时地把那些因严重自私自利、违法乱纪而破坏党的原则、危害党的事业的不可救药的分子清洗出党，以保持和不断提高党在人民群众中的威望。
    王振海之所以造下这种罪孽，而未能得到及时的制止，原定县地委会的多数同志负有严重的政治责任。在一九五○年初，即当王振海刚开始他的罪恶行动的时候，定县地委会便已发觉他的严重的反党性质，但当时除了少数同志表示抗议并在以后向他进行斗争以外，多数同志对于王振海的这种反党行为却不表示义愤，既不对他展开坚决的斗争，也不向上级党委作报告，而一再采取腐朽的自由主义态度，听之任之，这就在实际上放纵了王振海的犯罪行为。他们或者麻木不仁，抱着“得过且过”“多一事不如少一事”的态度；或者不敢破除情面，不敢得罪别人，怕由此招来对自己的“不利”和引起别人的反批评；或者惧怕党内斗争和自我批评，认为开展党内斗争来克服党内一切坏现象，会妨碍党的“团结”，因而对坏现象敷衍了事，采取调和的折中的态度；有的甚至投党内分歧之机，看风使舵，有意掩饰或冲淡那些“权力在握”但是做了坏事的人的错误，打击那些坚持真理、仗义执言的同志。他们斤斤计较个人的得失，不揭开问题，不坚持真理，不敢和坏人坏事作斗争，置党的原则和人民利益于不顾。尤其不能令人容忍的，是经过亲自调查将事实真相弄清以后，他们竟还在这样重大的原则问题上继续采取调和的、折中的态度，有意向省委写混淆是非、掩饰王振海错误的假报告。试问这些居于领导地位的共产党员，他们的一点起码的党性到什么地方去了呢？可以断言：如果原定县地委会多数同志不是在这个问题上采取调和的、折中的态度而能及早采取措施，将问题摆到桌子面上来，并按照党的原则展开争论，并将争论中的问题如实地向上级反映，则王振海的反党罪行将不至于发展到如此严重的程度，而能得到及时的制止，这种反党罪行给党和人民事业所造成的损害，也不至发展到如此严重的程度，而能得到及时的挽救。
    由此应当得出教训：我们党的同志间特别是领导同志间，对于任何原则性的错误和各种坏现象不能采取腐朽的自由主义态度或抹煞原则的“折中”态度。任何一个同志特别是领导同志之间，对于任何一种违反党的原则的错误现象，对于一切坏人坏事，不管他是什么人，都应按照党的原则坚持斗争。凡是企图以牺牲党的原则来达到个人卑鄙目的的人，党对待他们就是要使他们达不到这种个人目的。党的领导机关应及时将各种错误问题揭开，将一切政策性、原则性的问题和分歧摆到桌面上来，以批评和自我批评及正确的党内斗争来克服党内一切坏的现象，不许明知而不过问、不斗争，不许采取庸俗敷衍的态度。目前在领导干部间的这种庸俗敷衍的态度是不少的，必须坚决打掉。
    原定县地委会的其他负责干部（如前定县地委副书记范文兴同志）曾向河北省委揭发过这个案件，如果河北省委及纪律检查委员会在事件揭发之后不采取官僚主义的态度，而采取认真负责的态度立即加以严肃处理，那末这一错误也可以得到适当的制止，及早消除坏人坏事和混乱现象，挽回党的影响。但是，河北省委及纪律检查委员会没有能够这样做。河北省委及纪律检查委员会在接到范文兴同志第一次控告后，竟未引起应有的注意，既不派人彻查，也不责令地委会负责查清，只是写信令王振海本人作检讨。王振海拒不作检讨，定县地委会向省委写来假报告，省委又居然信以为真，不采取任何措施。及至一九五二年三月范文兴同志再次向省委揭发了这一案件，省委纪律检查委员会虽派人去当地调查，但仍不准备切实弄清是非，解决问题，继续采取敷衍了事的态度，以案情复杂，一时难以弄清为藉口，用所谓“具结了案”的办法草草结束。河北省委在刘青山、张子善反党事件之后，没有吸取应有的教训，对于王振海事件的处理，又犯了同样性质的错误。他们对于定县地委会主要负责同志显然的分歧意见，一开始又采取官僚主义的态度，不采取必要的措施去弄清事实并表明自己的原则意见，一直使事情发展到极端严重的地步，这是河北省委政治领导和思想领导薄弱的必然结果，是对干部的错误特别是高级干部的错误采取姑息态度的必然结果。对于干部的错误特别是高级干部的错误，藉口“过去有功劳”、“过去表现还不错”、“看起来还老实”、“一般说来还是好干部”等，不去加以警惕，不认真地实行检查，问题摆到面前来了，仍然仅凭自己平素极不深刻的老印象，认为“这个人不会这样吧？”以为事情“大概不至于弄到这样吧？”因而仍然没有下决心去把这个事情弄清楚，还是马马虎虎，不作结论，这是极其错误的。这是领导作风上的严重官僚主义的表现。
    由此应当得出教训：领导机关对于干部中的任何一种原则性的错误和分歧，都不许可采取官僚主义的态度，应明确表示自己的原则意见，及时做出正确的结论；必须以加强思想领导和勤于检查的办法，对干部中一切违反党的政策原则的错误和对这种错误的姑息态度作斗争，这是教育和挽救犯错误的干部的唯一正确的办法。对待任何干部所犯的错误，都只能是根据党的原则，而不能根据干部的职位；只应当根据事实，而不能根据主观的印象，否则便是错误的。事实一再证明领导机关的官僚主义足以害死人、葬送干部、并削弱党的战斗力，放松反对官僚主义就是放任危害党和人民事业的罪行，这当然是不能允许的。
    反党分子王振海的犯罪事件业已处理结束，但这一事件所给我们的教训是不能被遗忘的，愿全党同志记取这些教训！
