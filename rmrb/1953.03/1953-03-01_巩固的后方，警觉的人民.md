    A Consolidated Rear, Vigilant People
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Dai Huang
    This is a place on the east coast near the front lines. In the shade of a tree at a crossroads on a vast open field, stood a young Korean girl holding a gun. She wore a white towel given to her by a Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier on her head, a silk pink short jacket, and a green skirt that reached her knees. She listened to the rumble of artillery fire from the southern front and the roar of our coastal artillery and enemy warships fighting each other a few miles away on the coast in front of her; while firmly grasping the gun in her hand, she vigilantly watched all directions. She would stand here until dusk, perhaps until late at night; later, a strong young man, or a young woman, would replace her. At this crossroads in the rear of the front lines, people are vigilantly guarding and checking every passing pedestrian day and night.
    I habitually handed her my documents for inspection. Such things are not new to me. The American aggressors have been trying to expand their aggression. They are constantly sending many secret agents into the rear of the Korean and Chinese People's forces to disrupt public order and probe military intelligence. However, the rear of the Korean and Chinese People's forces is consolidated and tight. Not only do the governments, garrisons, and public security forces in various places have extremely strong and tight anti-espionage organizations, but also the broad masses of people in North Korea have organized self-defense teams, making it impossible for those secret agent bandits who parachute from American planes, are sent to the coast by American landing craft, and are ambushed by the enemy when they fled North Korea to escape.
    The east coast people's self-defense teams are like a tight net. In many open fields, village edges, and mountain tops, you can encounter young men and women with armbands on their left arms and guns in their hands, or teenagers or old people holding sharp broadswords and spears. These brave people with a high degree of vigilance have played a significant role in the struggle to consolidate public security in the rear.
    Han Guofan, a 27-year-old farmer in Gaoyuan County, is an expert at catching secret agents. After being wounded on the front lines in the spring of 1951, he was discharged from the Korean People's Army and returned home, where he led the masses in actively producing and donating weapons to support the front lines. Later, enemy planes often dropped secret agents over the deep mountains around his village, so he mobilized the masses of the entire village to cooperate with the government and the army to eliminate them. One day in September 1951, he went up the mountain to investigate alone and found a place on the mountain that was very suspicious, as if secret agents were hiding there. The next day, he led three self-defense team members disguised as woodcutters to investigate again. After investigating for fifteen consecutive days, he was certain that this was the nest of the secret agents. He and the self-defense team members took knives and guns and went up the mountain in force and captured three secret agents alive.
    One night, an enemy plane circled over Han Guofan's village for a long time. Han Guofan, already experienced in struggle, reported to the nearby national public security forces and social security personnel early the next morning, and went up the mountain with them to search. They only fired a few shots and captured alive a secret agent with automatic weapons and a signal gun, and found a very large grass-green parachute in a stone crevice.
    Zhang Xishu, the self-defense captain of another village in Gaoyuan County, was a person who escaped death after breaking out of the enemy's prison in 1950. He deeply realized that hidden secret agents were more vicious and dangerous than enemies who fired guns in trenches. After the Volunteer Army and the People's Army liberated his hometown, he actively trained young men and women to protect the safety of the rear. One night in July 1951, enemy planes dropped a group of armed secret agents over their village. These secret agents were very cunning. After untying their parachutes, they hid in the distant mountains. Zhang Xishu led the self-defense team members to find out the mountain cave where the secret agents were hiding, and bravely rushed into the cave and captured a secret agent. Later, he eliminated all these airborne secret agents.
    Among these secret agents, some had betrayed their motherland and the people under the vicious deception and threats of the American aggressors. They did not understand the government's policies and dared not surrender to the government. For such people, the local regimes and people on the east coast implemented the policy of lenient treatment for accomplices as long as they surrendered and repented, and achieved great results. Yang Binghuan, a poor peasant in Gaoyuan County, was forced to join the "Republic of Korea Youth Corps" by the Li Chengwan bandit army after the People's Army withdrew north in the autumn of 1950. When the Korean and Chinese People's forces recovered this place, he was threatened by the secret agents again and dared not surrender to the government. He reluctantly followed the hidden secret agents and ran around in the mountains for more than a year. Later, he secretly went down the mountain and returned home. His wife persuaded him to surrender in tears, and told him that the government would be lenient to those who surrendered. Yang Binghuan listened and cried, recounting the suffering of being without clothes or food and being frightened for more than a year. He immediately went to the government with his wife to surrender and repent, and led the public security forces to search for those secret agents who refused to surrender.
    On this tense, fighting coastline, almost everyone has a high degree of vigilance. People told me: Even the children here actively participate in the struggle to eliminate secret agents. On May 17th last year, Zhao Fushun, a female student in the fifth grade of Xingnan City No. 1 People's School, encountered five people dressed as People's Army soldiers on a road in the suburbs of Xingnan City. They asked her about the location of the People's Army troops. Their actions aroused Zhao Fushun's suspicion. Therefore, she did not tell them the location of the troops and monitored the actions of these people. At this time, two People's Army officers with pistols came face to face. Zhao Fushun quickly went to report to them. The officers immediately took out their pistols and ordered the five people to stop. Later, it was found out that these five people were secret agents disguised as soldiers of the People's Army to probe military intelligence.
    From September 1951 to August last year, the children of the first branch of the Young Pioneers of the fifth People's School of Shanggu Township, Gaoyuan County, cooperated with the public security forces to capture twelve secret agents. One evening in November 1951, Zhao Changcheng, the chairman of the branch, a 14-year-old fifth-grade student, and his 11-year-old sister were preparing to eat at home when suddenly two people pushed the door open and asked them for food. The weather was very good that day, but these two people were soaked all over, and their faces were pale, their hair was very long, and they spoke tremblingly. The alert Zhao Changcheng knew that these two guys were not good people, so he pretended to be diligent, asked his sister to bring them food, and chatted with them while roasting their clothes next to the brazier. When the two guys were eating like hungry dogs, he winked at his sister, signaling her to go out to report to the public security forces. The alert little sister pretended to go out to herd cattle and reported to the public security forces. After a while, four armed public security fighters came in and arrested the two secret agents.

    巩固的后方，警觉的人民
    新华社记者　戴煌
    这是东海岸上临近前线的一个地方。在一片空旷的原野上的一个交叉路口的树荫下，站着一位持枪的年轻的朝鲜姑娘。她头上包着中国人民志愿军战士送给她的白毛巾，身上穿着丝质的粉红短袄和齐胸遮膝的绿裙子。她一面听着南面战线上传来的隆隆炮声和前面十几里外海边上我们的海岸大炮和敌舰作战的轰鸣声；一面紧握着手中的枪，警惕地注视着四方。她要在这里站到黄昏，也许要到深夜；以后，就有一个年轻力壮的小伙子，或者是一个少妇来代替她。在这战线后方的交叉路口上，日日夜夜都有人在警惕地守卫着、检查着每一个来往的行人。
    我很习惯地将我的证件交给她检查。这样的事情对我并不生疏。美国侵略者一直在企图扩大侵略行动，他们不断地派遣许多特务进入朝中人民部队的后方来扰乱治安，刺探军情。但是，朝中人民部队的后方是巩固的、严密的。不但各地的政府、驻军和公安部队有着极其坚强、严密的反间谍组织，北朝鲜广大人民也组织起自卫队伍，使那些从美国飞机上空降下来的、由美国登陆艇送到海岸上来的和敌人从北朝鲜逃跑时有计划地埋伏下来的特务匪徒们无路可逃。
    东海岸人民的自卫队伍好像一面紧密的大网。在很多旷野中、村庄边和山头上，你都能遇到左臂上套着臂章、手中握着枪的青年男女，或者手执锋锐的大刀长矛的少年或老人。这些有着高度警惕性的英勇的人们在巩固后方治安的斗争中起了显著的作用。
    高原郡有一个二十七岁的农民韩国范，就是一个捉特务的能手。一九五一年春天，他在前线负伤以后，就从朝鲜人民军中复员回家，在家乡带领群众积极生产，捐献武器支援前线。后来，敌机常常在他村庄周围的深山的上空降下特务，他就动员全村的群众配合政府和军队去肃清他们。一九五一年九月的一天他独自上山侦察，发现山上有一个地方非常可疑，好像隐藏着特务。第二天，他又领着三个化装成樵夫的自卫队员再去侦察，一连侦察了十五天，肯定地认为这是特务们的巢穴。他就和自卫队员们带着刀枪大队上山活捉了三个特务。
    有一天晚上，一架敌机在韩国范的村庄的上空盘旋了很久。韩国范已经有了丰富的斗争经验，第二天一早他就派人报告附近的国家公安部队和社会治安人员，并和他们一齐上山搜索。他们只打了几枪，就活捉了一个带着自动武器和信号枪的特务，并在一个石缝中搜出了一顶很大的草绿色的降落伞。
    高原郡另一个村的自卫队长张熙洙是一九五零年越出敌人的监狱而死里逃生的人。他深刻地体会到隐蔽的特务比在战壕中开枪抵抗的敌人更要凶恶和危险。当志愿军和人民军解放了他的家乡以后，他就积极地训练青年男女，保卫后方的安全。一九五一年七月的一天夜间，敌机在他们村子上空投下了一批武装特务。这些特务很狡猾，解下降落伞后就都躲藏到很远的大山里去了。张熙洙带着自卫队员们侦察清楚特务隐藏的山洞，就勇敢地冲进山洞，捉住了一个特务。后来并把这批空降特务全部消灭了。
    在这些特务中，有一些人是在美国侵略者恶毒的欺骗和威胁之下、背叛了祖国和人民的。他们不了解政府的政策，不敢向政府自首。对于这样的人，东海岸上的各地方政权机关和人民执行了对于胁从分子只要投诚自新，就对他们宽大处理的政策，获得很大成绩。高原郡的贫农杨炳焕，在一九五零年秋天人民军北撤后，被李承晚匪军抓去强迫参加了
    “大韩民国青年团”。当朝中人民部队收复了这个地方后，他又受了特务们的恐吓，不敢向政府自首，勉强跟着隐蔽下来的特务东躲西藏地在大山中跑了一年多。后来他偷偷地下山回家，他的妻子就流着泪劝他自首，并且告诉他政府对自首的人可以宽大处理。杨炳焕听着也哭了起来，痛述了一年多来无衣无食心惊胆战的苦楚，立刻和妻子到政府去自首悔过，并领着公安部队去搜捕那些拒不投诚的特务。
    在这条紧张的、战斗的海岸线上，几乎每一个人都有着高度的警惕性。人们告诉我：就是这里的小孩子也积极参加肃清特务的斗争。去年五月十七日，兴南市第一人民学校五年级的女学生赵福顺在兴南市郊的一条路上碰到了五个穿人民军战士服装的人。他们向她打听人民军部队的驻地。他们的行动引起了赵福顺的怀疑，因此，她没有告诉他们部队的驻地，并且监视着这几个人的行动。这时，迎面来了两个带着手枪的人民军军官。赵福顺迅速走去向他们报告。军官们立即掏出手枪命令这五个人站住。后来查清，原来这五个人是化装成人民军的战士来刺探军情的特务。
    高原郡上谷面第五人民学校少年团第一分团的孩子们从一九五一年九月到去年八月就配合公安部队捉住了十二名特务。一九五一年十一月的一个傍晚，分团的委员长——一个十四岁的五年级学生赵昌成和十一岁的妹妹在家里正准备吃饭，忽然有两个人推门进来，向他们要饭吃。这天天气很好，然而这两个人却全身都湿透了，而且面色苍白，头发很长，说话战战抖抖的。机警的赵昌成知道这两个家伙不是好人，于是他假装殷勤，叫妹妹端饭给他们吃，他自己一边和他们聊天，一边在火盆旁边给他们烤衣服。当那两个家伙正像饿狗似地吃饭的时候，他就向妹妹丢个眼色，示意她出去报告公安部队，机警的小妹妹就假装出去放牛去报告了公安部队。一会，四个持枪的公安战士进来就把两个特务捉住了。
