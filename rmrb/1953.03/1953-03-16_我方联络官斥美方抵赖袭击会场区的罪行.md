Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 15th: While the US side unscrupulously creates provocative incidents that undermine the various administrative agreements of the Korean armistice talks, it shamelessly denies its responsibility for undermining the agreements. At around 2:20 AM on March 2nd, armed personnel under the control of the US side opened fire on the conference area. Security officers from both sides conducted a joint investigation of this serious incident, and both human and material evidence fully proved the US side's inescapable responsibility. On March 5th, the chief liaison officer of our delegation lodged a serious protest with the other side. However, at the liaison officer meeting on March 14th, the other side flatly denied the facts, brazenly claiming that it could not be sure whether bullets had entered the conference area at the time, attempting to shirk responsibility. Our liaison officer sternly pointed out that the other side's denial was completely inconsistent with the facts determined by the human and material evidence in the joint investigation. Witnesses stated that they saw tracer bullets fired from the other side's area into the southern part of the conference area, toward the western highland. Armed personnel under the control of the other side fired at our security officers who were on duty near the center of the conference area. Bullets flew in front of, behind, and on top of his vehicle. Armed personnel from the other side left a grenade on the periphery of the conference area, and there were obvious footprints near the periphery leading from and returning to the other side's area. All of these proved that the other side's armed personnel approached the conference area and fired at the conference area. Our liaison officer pointed out: In the face of these indisputable and ironclad facts, the other side still brazenly attempts to deny responsibility, which is enough to prove that the other side is attempting to continue to undermine the maintenance of the conference area, but the other side can never escape full responsibility for all the serious consequences arising therefrom.

    我方联络官斥美方抵赖袭击会场区的罪行
    【新华社开城十五日电】美方一面肆无忌惮地制造破坏朝鲜停战谈判各项行政性协议的挑衅事件，一面厚颜无耻地信口抵赖其破坏协议的责任。三月二日二时二十分左右，美方控制下的武装人员开枪射击会场区，会场区双方安全军官对这一严重事件进行了共同调查，人证和物证都充分证明了美方的不可逃避的责任。三月五日我方代表团首席联络官为此向对方提出了严重抗议。但在三月十四日双方联络官会上，对方矢口抵赖事实，公然声称不能肯定当时是否有枪弹射进会场区，企图推卸责任。我方联络官严正指出，对方的抵赖全然不符共同调查中人证和物证所确定的事实，证人曾说明当时他们目击有曳光弹自对方地区射入会场区内南部偏西的高地，对方控制下的武装人员并向乘车在会场区中心附近执行任务的我方安全军官射击，枪弹在他的车前车后及车上飞过，对方武装人员在会场区周界上并遗留手榴弹一枚，周界附近且有来自并返回对方地区的明显足迹，这些都证明了对方武装人员接近了会场区，向会场区进行射击。我方联络官指出：在这些无可置辩的铁的事实面前，对方尚厚颜无耻地企图抵赖责任，足以证明对方企图继续破坏会场区的维持，但对方决不能逃脱由此而引起的一切严重后果的完全责任。
