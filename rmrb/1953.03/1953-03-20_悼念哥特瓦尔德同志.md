    In Memoriam of Comrade Gottwald
    Xiong Botao, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Public Security Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    Comrade Gottwald has passed away. We have lost a friend, and the world's peace and democracy camp has lost an outstanding fighter. This is a very sad event.

    On October 1, 1951, to celebrate the founding of the Czechoslovak Republic's army, our delegation from the Chinese People's Liberation Army arrived in Prague. On the 3rd, Comrade Gottwald received us in his office. We presented him with gifts from the Chinese people and conveyed to him greetings of friendship from Chairman Mao. He took the gifts, holding up high the beautiful embroidery with both hands, and then raising the cloisonné enamel vase, touching the harmonious structure and the simple-colored vase pattern, his face beaming with pride and admiration. He said, "Just as Comrade Mao Zedong said, 'The Chinese people have always been a great, brave, and hardworking nation!'" Then, he reviewed the historical pictures of the Chinese revolutionary struggle. He carefully turned over each one, and when he saw a picture of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu meeting in Jinggang Mountain, he raised his head and said to himself, "Using the spirit of Leninism-Stalinism principles, leading the heroic Chinese people, creating a heroic revolutionary cause, and giving the enemies of peace a fatal blow."

    He asked us to sit beside him and received us with brotherly friendship. He listened with such joy and interest to our answers to his questions (about the brilliant achievements of our motherland in peaceful construction). He said, "'Leaning to one side'... China under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong is an important part of the world's peace and democracy camp. In this country, 500 million people are leaning to this side. This is of great importance, especially since the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has solidified the Sino-Soviet friendship, making the contrast between the strength of the world's peace and democracy camp and the strength of imperialism even more obvious.

    "In the desire to defend national independence and prosperity, and to defend peace in Asia and the world, the people of Czechoslovakia, together with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, must establish and continuously develop close friendship and cooperation with the Chinese people."

    He continued to enthusiastically introduce to us the achievements that the Czechoslovak Republic had already achieved in implementing the Five-Year Plan. He said, "By 1953, our country will produce 2.7 million tons of iron and 3.5 million tons of steel... Our main goal is to improve the material and cultural living standards of the working people and to create conditions for Czechoslovakia's great socialist construction and to promote the socialist industrialization of various people's democratic countries."

    Time passed quickly, and we said goodbye to Comrade Gottwald. In the past year, the great image of Comrade Gottwald, with his enthusiasm, profundity, firmness, and vitality, has constantly appeared in my mind.

    During our days in the Czechoslovak Republic, Comrade Gottwald gave us every opportunity to visit cities, villages, and places of interest. The huge factories and magnificent buildings, not only the tranquil Vltava River, the lush linden tree-lined streets, and the well-equipped villages, left a deep impression on us, but what was particularly unforgettable was the construction boom of millions of Czechoslovak workers under the leadership of Comrade Gottwald. Their selfless work ethic has enabled the great socialist construction of Czechoslovakia to advance rapidly, and we have further recognized the great strength of the peace camp.

    The people of Czechoslovakia dearly loved Comrade Gottwald; they also showed deep friendship towards Chairman Mao and the Chinese people. On the evening of October 7th, the founding of Czechoslovak army, the crowds celebrating the festival on the streets of Prague surrounded the members of our delegation, dancing all night long. The workers held our hands tightly, close to their chests, and rhythmically cheered "Mao Zedong - Gottwald!" An old woman with white hair, ignoring the crowds, affectionately stroked one of our representatives, chanting, "Mao Zedong - Gottwald!" The great friendship between China and Czechoslovakia, condensed in the two glorious names of "Mao Zedong - Gottwald," echoed in the sleepless streets of Prague. On this night, we deeply felt the flesh-and-blood connection between the Czechoslovak people and their great leader, Comrade Gottwald.

    Comrade Gottwald has passed away. For the past year, I have often recalled the moment when I met Comrade Gottwald, and considered it a blessing. Now, this memory fills me with infinite grief. Comrade Gottwald's spirit of dedicating his life to the Czechoslovak people's revolution will forever live in our hearts, inspiring us to move forward. We must turn grief into strength, resolutely unite with the people of the Soviet Union, the people of the Czechoslovak Republic, and the people of all people's democratic countries, raise our vigilance, and fight to the end for the cause of peace and democracy, and for the cause of communism.

    Comrade Gottwald will live forever!

    悼念哥特瓦尔德同志
    中国人民解放军公安部队副参谋长　熊伯涛
    哥特瓦尔德同志逝世了。我们失掉了一个朋友，世界和平民主阵营失掉了一个卓越的战士。这是一件非常令人悲痛的事。
    一九五一年十月一日，为庆祝捷克斯洛伐克共和国建军节，我们中国人民解放军代表团到了布拉格。三日，哥特瓦尔德同志在他自己的办公室中接见我们。我们把中国人民的礼物献给他，把毛主席的友谊问候转达给他。他接过礼物，两手高高地擎起那美丽的织绣，又举起景泰蓝彩陶花瓶，摸索着结构和谐、色彩质朴的花瓶图案，脸上泛起了骄傲、赞叹的神采。他说：“正如毛泽东同志所说，‘中国人民从来就是一个伟大的勇敢的勤劳的民族’啊！”接着，他又展阅中国革命斗争的历史图片。他仔细地一张一张翻过，当看到毛主席和朱总司令在井冈山会师的一幅图片时，他抬起头来，自言自语地说：“用列宁斯大林原则的精神，领导着英勇的中国人民，创造了革命的英雄事业，给和平的敌人以致命的打击。”
    他让我们在他的身旁坐下，以兄弟般的友谊接待我们。他是那样欣喜而又富于情趣地倾听着我们回答他的问话（关于我们祖国在和平建设中的光辉成就）。他说：“‘一边倒’……毛泽东同志领导的中国，是世界和平民主阵营的重要部分，在这个国家里，五万万人民倒向这一边，关系至大，特别是由中苏友好同盟互助条约所固定下来的中苏友谊，使世界和平民主阵营的力量与帝国主义力量的对比发生了更加明显的变化了。
    “在保卫祖国独立繁荣、保卫亚洲及世界和平的愿望中，捷克斯洛伐克人民同苏联和其他人民民主国家一起，一定要建立和不断发展与中国人民的亲密友谊和合作。”
    他继续热情地向我们介绍了捷克斯洛伐克共和国实行五年计划已经达到的成就。他说：“到一九五三年，我国将生产二百七十万吨铁，三百五十万吨钢……。我们努力的主要目标，就是：提高劳动人民的物质生活水准和文化水平，为捷克斯洛伐克伟大的社会主义建设事业及促进各人民民主国家走上社会主义工业化，创造条件。”
    时间匆匆过去，我们告别了哥特瓦尔德同志。近一年来，在我的心中，不时浮现着哥特瓦尔德同志的热情、深邃、坚定、充满生命活力的伟大形象。
    在捷克斯洛伐克共和国的日子里，哥特瓦尔德同志给了我们一切方便的机会，参观了城市、乡村和名胜。那巨大的工厂、宏伟的建筑，不但那宁静的维尔塔发河，那繁茂的菩提林荫，那设备完善的村庄，都给我们留下了深刻的印象，而特别使我们铭怀难忘的，是哥特瓦尔德同志领导下的千百万捷克斯洛伐克工人的建设热潮。他们忘我的工作精神，使捷克斯洛伐克的伟大社会主义建设飞速前进，我们进一步认识了和平阵营的伟大力量。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民对哥特瓦尔德同志是挚爱的；对毛主席和中国人民也表现了深厚的友谊。十月七日，捷克斯洛伐克建军节的晚上，布拉格街头，欢庆节日的人流，把我们代表团人员围起来，狂舞通宵。工人们紧握着双手，贴近胸间，有节奏地欢呼着“毛泽东——哥特瓦尔德！”一位有白发的老妇人，不顾人群的拥挤，深情挚意地抚摩着我们的一个代表，嘴里念着：“毛泽东——哥特瓦尔德！”中捷两国的伟大友谊，凝结在“毛泽东——哥特瓦尔德”这两个光辉的名字里，响彻在不夜的布拉格街头。在这个夜晚，我们深切体会到：捷克斯洛伐克人民与其伟大领袖——哥特瓦尔德同志之间的血肉联系。
    哥特瓦尔德同志逝世了。一年来，我常常回忆会见哥特瓦尔德同志的那个时刻，并引为幸福。如今，这回忆却引起我无限哀痛。哥特瓦尔德同志把自己的一生献给捷克斯洛伐克人民革命的精神，永远活在我们的心里，鼓舞着我们前进。我们要化悲痛为力量，坚决和苏联人民、捷克斯洛伐克共和国人民及各人民民主国家人民团结一致，提高警惕，为和平与民主的事业，为共产主义的事业奋斗到底。
    哥特瓦尔德同志永垂不朽！
