    Middle School Chinese Textbooks Must Be Appropriately Edited and Selected with Classical Literature Works
    Yu Chengyu, Tang Chu, Xiu Gufan, Xu Zhonghua, Wen Guoxin, Zhao Jingjie, Liu Yaoxin, Xiang Jinjiang, Collective Discussion, Xiang Jinjiang drafted the article
    Editor's Note: At a forum held by the newspaper's editorial department, Chinese language teachers from several middle schools in Beijing raised many opinions on the current middle school Chinese textbooks. This article is based on the teachers' opinions.
    Our great motherland has a very rich literary heritage. In the long history of about three thousand years, our literature has been developing continuously, and almost every era has produced immortal works loved by the people. These works each express the people's lives and struggles, as well as the people's thoughts, feelings, wishes, and demands of that era. Therefore, today's middle school Chinese textbooks should appropriately include classical literature works, so that the content of the Chinese language curriculum can be more substantial and richer. Through the teaching of classical literature works, we can better conduct patriotism education for students, so that students can more deeply realize that the Chinese nation "is a nation with a glorious revolutionary tradition and an excellent historical heritage."
    Why should classical literature be taught in middle school Chinese classes? The reason is very obvious. For elementary school students, due to language barriers, it is difficult to teach classical literature; as for universities, except for students in the literature department, there are no opportunities to study literature courses. But we should let the younger generation have knowledge of classical literature. In this way, the task of systematically teaching classical literature falls on middle school education.
    In the past, compilers of middle school Chinese textbooks often confused classical literature works with classical Chinese. According to the scope of so-called "national studies," they mixed literary works with works related to philosophy, politics, philology, textual research, and other aspects. As a result, Chinese textbooks ranged from the masters of thought to essays of the late Ming Dynasty, colorful and all-encompassing. Most of the works were in classical Chinese, with very little spoken literature after the Song and Yuan dynasties. This shows that the textbook compilers did not pay much attention to spoken literature. Secondly, the content of many works contains toxins. It is inevitable that modern young students are unwilling to read these things; it is also inevitable that teachers will fail when teaching with such teaching materials.
    Since liberation, textbook publishing agencies have basically attached importance to the editing work of middle school Chinese textbooks and have paid attention to the ideology of the textbook content. However, in the selection of classical literature works, they still have not jumped out of the circle of their predecessors, and the compilers' focus is still on classical Chinese. Therefore, our classical literature teaching has failed in the past three years. The main reason is that the compilers lack a clear understanding of the teaching purpose of classical literature.
    Due to the failure of classical literature teaching, another phenomenon has emerged: teachers look at the few classical Chinese articles attached to the textbook and feel that they are not worth much to teach, so they only select one or two articles to teach in a semester, and some simply do not teach them at all. The consequence is that students completely ignore the study of classical literature, and cannot even possess the most basic related knowledge. For example, in the summer of 1951, in a university entrance examination, a student actually regarded Qu Yuan, a great ancient Chinese poet, as a foreigner. Here, we should blame ourselves to young students.
    In order to enable middle school teachers to better teach classical literature to students, it is necessary to re-edit and select classical literature teaching materials.
    What are the shortcomings of the current middle school Chinese textbooks in the selection of classical literature works?
    First of all, the compilers did not give classical literature works the due position in middle school Chinese classes. The "Editorial Intent" of the old senior high school Chinese textbook stated: "Starting from the third volume, several classical Chinese articles are selected. The main purpose of selecting classical Chinese is to enable students to clearly understand the similarities and differences between classical Chinese and modern spoken language, and to develop the preliminary ability to read classical Chinese reference books." The "Publisher's Words" of the 1952 revised senior high school Chinese textbook also stated: "Starting from the first volume, classical Chinese is also selected to cultivate students' preliminary ability to read classical Chinese." Judging from these words, the compilers' focus is only on classical Chinese, and they have not considered at all that middle school students should also acquire basic knowledge about Chinese classical literature in the middle school Chinese curriculum. For example, only the fifth volume of the junior high school Chinese textbook gives a simple introduction to Qu Yuan, a talented ancient Chinese poet; as for the senior high school textbook, even his name is not mentioned, let alone his works. Although the 1952 revised senior high school textbook selected "The Book of Songs" and poems by Li Bai, Lu You, and others, it did not introduce other important classical literature works, such as the folk songs of the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties, as well as the poems of Tao Qian, a great poet of the Jin Dynasty, and the operas of representative Yuan Dynasty playwrights.
    Since the compilers' purpose is only to have students read "several classical Chinese articles," the selection of materials lacks principles. The compilers did not carefully select the works of the most important writers of each era or works with representative significance, but instead selected some unimportant works such as Ma Duanlin's "Lake Field and Embankment Field," Tang Zhen's "Power and Reality," and Wang Fu's "The Rich and the Poor."
    Although the textbook also introduces the works of some important writers, some of these works lack representativeness. For example, the "Three Poems by Du Fu" in the fifth volume of the senior high school textbook: "Meeting a Farmer Who Urged Me to Drink with Wine After Heavy Rain, Praising Vice-Envoy Yan," "On Events" and "Again Presenting to Wu Lang" are not representative works of Du Fu.
    Another serious shortcoming of the current middle school Chinese textbooks is the lack of systematicness in the selection of classical literature works, and the proportion is also inappropriate. Each volume of the textbook often mixes works from various eras. Taking the newly compiled fourth volume of the senior high school textbook as an example, this book not only contains works from the Warring States period and the Han Dynasty, but also works from the Tang, Song, and Qing dynasties (the old version also included classical Chinese articles by modern people such as Cai Yuanpei and Chen Yuan together with classical works). The lesson "Eight Quatrains" actually combines the works of poets from the Tang and Song dynasties with different themes and styles, which makes teachers feel great difficulty in teaching (because each poem has its own teaching purpose). This kind of compilation is not good for teaching. It cannot enable students to see the development process of our people's literature from the study of classical literature works. The proportion of classical literature works in the textbook is extremely inappropriate. Each grade of the senior high school textbook has classical literature works, but only two articles are selected in the junior high school textbook. Among our classical literature works, there are many beautiful and easy-to-read poems, as well as beautiful legends and folk songs. Why not select some into the textbook?
    To take a step back, judging from the articles selected in the textbook, can students "develop the preliminary ability to read classical Chinese reference books"? We think it is impossible. The senior high school Chinese textbook has classical Chinese articles from the third volume, but from the third to the sixth volume, the compilers did not arrange them according to the principle of moving from the shallow to the deep and proceeding in an orderly and gradual manner. Only the articles selected in the third volume are shorter, and the articles selected in the other volumes are longer. Judging from the situation of some texts after the revision, it is enough to show that the compilers have been inconsiderate in this regard. For example, Shen Kuo's "Movable Type" was originally placed in the sixth volume, but now it is placed in the first volume; "Ballad of Mulan" was originally placed in the third volume, but now it has also been revised and placed in the first volume. If it is said that the current revision is appropriate, then it cannot be denied that the previous compilation was inappropriate, because the compilers did not carefully consider which article is most suitable for students in which grade to read. Such a Chinese textbook with messy materials and shortcomings in arrangement cannot only fail to arouse students' interest in learning, but also cannot blame Chinese teachers for completing the teaching task of "cultivating students' preliminary ability to read classical Chinese."
    In order to do a good job in editing middle school Chinese textbooks, we would like to put forward a few opinions: First, we hope that the textbook publishing agency will organize several comrades who have research on classical literature to participate in the editing work. Second, when compiling classical literature works, special attention should be paid to the masterpieces of anonymous writers produced from the people; the writers we want to introduce must be the most outstanding representatives of each era, and the selected works must also be their main representative works. Third, in the arrangement of teaching materials, they can be arranged according to the era, so as to systematically, comprehensively, and with emphasis introduce classical literature works to students, so that middle school students can know the great writers and great works of our motherland. Fourth, in order to take care of students' ability to accept, we should select more works with relatively simple texts (necessary annotations should be attached after the texts), and form units according to the era (write a simple introduction before each unit to explain the literary characteristics and basic spirit of this era). Fifth, introduce the life of the writers so that teachers can correctly use these teaching materials to teach. Sixth, compile and print selected works of important ancient writers (with detailed annotations) and annotated versions of long masterpieces as supplementary reading materials for young students, so that our younger generation can learn more about the outstanding ancient writers of our motherland.

    中学语文课本必须适当地编选古典文学作品
    于澄宇　唐初　脩古藩  徐仲华　闻国新　赵晶洁  刘曜昕　向锦江　集体讨论  向锦江执笔
    编者按：在本报编辑部召开的一次座谈会上，参加会议的北京市若干中学的语文教师对现在的中学语文课本提出了很多意见。本文就是根据教师们的意见写出的。
    我们伟大祖国的文学遗产是非常丰富的。在大约三千年的悠久时间里，我们的文学是不断发展着的，几乎每一个时代都产生了为人民喜爱的不朽作品，这些作品各自表现了那个时代人民的生活和斗争，以及人民的思想、感情、愿望和要求。因此，今天的中学语文课本应该适当地编选古典文学作品，以便使语文课程的内容更为充实，更为丰富。通过古典文学作品的教学，能更好地对同学进行爱国主义教育，使同学更深切地认识到中华民族“是一个有光荣的革命传统和优秀的历史遗产的民族”。
    为什么要在中学语文课中进行古典文学的教学呢？理由是很显明的。对于小学生来说，由于文字的障碍，进行古典文学的教学是困难的；至于大学，除文学系的同学以外，也没有学习文学课程的机会。但是我们应该让年青的一代具备古典文学的知识，这样，系统地进行古典文学教学的任务，就落到中学教育的身上了。
    过去，中学语文课本的编者往往把古典文学作品和文言文混为一谈，他们按照所谓“国学”的范畴，将文学作品和有关哲学、政治、文字学、考据学等方面的作品混在一起，于是语文课本就从诸子百家到晚明小品，五光十色，无所不包。大多数作品又都是文言，极少宋元以后的口语文学。这说明教科书的编者对口语文学是极不重视的。其次，许多作品的内容是含有毒素的。现代青年学生不愿读这些东西是必然的；教师拿着这样的教材去教学，失败也是必然的。
    解放以后，教科书出版机关对中学语文课本的编辑工作基本上是重视的，注意了课本内容的思想性。但在编选古典文学作品上仍然没有跳出前人的圈子，编者的着眼点仍放在文言文上，因此，三年来我们的古典文学教学是失败的。其原因，主要在于编者对于古典文学的教学目的，缺乏明确的认识。
    由于古典文学教学的失败，就产生了另一种现象：教师看看附在课本中的几篇文言文的文章，觉得没有多少值得讲的价值，因此一学期中只是选讲一两篇，有的干脆就不讲了。其后果是使同学们完全忽视了对古典文学的学习，连极其普通的有关知识也不能具备。例如一九五一年夏季在某大学入学考试中，有一个学生竟把我国古代伟大诗人屈原当作外国人。这里，我们应向青年学生引咎自责。
    为了使中学教师更好地向同学进行古典文学的教学，重新编选古典文学教材是必要的。
    现在中学语文课本在古典文学作品的编选上有些什么缺点呢？
    首先，编者在中学语文课中没有给予古典文学作品以应有的地位。旧高中语文课本的“编辑大意”说：“从第三册起选了若干篇文言。选文言的主要目的，在使学生明确地了解文言跟现代口语的同异，养成阅读文言参考书的初步能力。”一九五二年改编的高中语文课本的“出版者的话”中也说：“从第一册起兼选文言文，用以培养学生阅读文言的初步能力。”从这几句话来看，编者的着眼点只在文言上，完全没有考虑到在中学语文课程中也应该让中学生获得关于中国古典文学的起码知识。例如，对我国古代天才诗人屈原，只有初中语文课本第五册对他作了简单的介绍；至于高中课本，就连他的名字也没有提到，更不必说他的作品了。一九五二年改编的高中课本，虽然选了“诗经”和李白、陆游等人的诗，但对其他重要古典文学作品，如汉、魏、六朝的乐府，以及晋代大诗人陶潜的诗和元曲代表作家的戏曲，就都没有介绍。
    编者的目的既然只是要学生读“若干篇文言文”，在选材上也就缺乏原则了。编者没有认真地选录各时代最重要作家的作品或有代表意义的作品，反而把一些无关紧要的作品如马端临的“湖田圩田”、唐甄的“权实”和王符的“富者与贫者”等选进去了。
    课本虽然也介绍了一些重要作家的作品，可是这些作品有的是缺乏代表性的。例如，高中课本第五册上的“杜甫诗三首”：“遭田父泥饮美严中丞”、“即事”和“又呈吴郎”，都不是杜甫的代表作。
    现行中学语文课本还有一个严重缺点，就是在古典文学作品的编选上缺乏系统性，比重也不适当。每一册课本往往错杂地罗列着各时代的作品。以新编高中课本第四册为例，在这一本书里，不仅有战国、汉代的作品，也有唐、宋、清各时代的作品
    （旧本中还把蔡元培和陈垣等现代人的文言文和古典作品编在一起）。“绝句八首”那一课竟把唐、宋两代诗人们的不同主题、不同风格的作品编在一起，使教师在进行教学时感到很大的困难（因为每首诗都有各自的教学目的）。这种编法对教学是没有好处的。它不能使同学们从古典文学作品的学习中看出我国人民文学的发展过程。课本在古典文学作品的分配比重上，是极不适当的。高中各年级课本中都有古典文学作品，可是初中课本中只选了两篇。在我们的古典文学作品中，有不少优美而又容易阅读的诗歌，以及美丽的传说、民谣，为什么不选一些到课本里来呢？
    退一步说，从课本中所选的文章来看，能不能使学生“养成阅读文言参考书的初步能力”呢？我们认为是不可能的。高中语文课本从第三册起有了文言文，可是从第三册到第六册，编者并没有按照由浅入深、循序渐进的原则来编排，只是第三册上所选的文章较短，其他几册上所选的文章较长而已。从有些课文在改编后的情况来看，足以说明编者在这方面是欠考虑的。例如沈括的“活版”原来放在第六册，现在则放在第一册了；“木兰辞”原来放在第三册，现在也改编在第一册了。如果说现在的改编是恰当的，那就不能不承认，过去的编法是不妥当的了，因为编者没有很好地考虑那一篇给那一年级同学读最合适。像这样取材杂乱、编排上有缺点的语文课本，不仅不能引起同学们的学习兴趣，也不能责成语文教师来完成“培养学生阅读文言的初步能力”的教学任务。
    为了把中学语文课本的编辑工作做好，我们愿意提出几点意见：第一、希望教科书出版机关组织几位对古典文学有研究的同志来参加编选工作。第二、在编选古典文学作品时，应特别重视从人民群众中产生的无名作家的杰作；我们要介绍的作家，必须是各时代中最杰出的代表，所选作品也必须是他们的主要代表作。第三、在教材的编排上，可以按照时代排列，以便系统地全面地有重点地向同学介绍古典文学作品，使中学生能够知道我们祖国的伟大作家和伟大作品。第四、为了照顾同学的接受能力，应该多选文字比较浅显的作品（课文后要附必要的注释），按时代组成单元（每个单元前面写一简单的介绍，以说明这时代的文学特征和基本精神）。第五、介绍作家的生平，使教师们可以正确地利用这些教材讲授。第六、编印古代重要作家选集（里面要附详细的注释）和长篇名著的注释本，作为青年学生的补充读物，以便让我们的青年一代更多地了解我们祖国的古代优秀作家。
