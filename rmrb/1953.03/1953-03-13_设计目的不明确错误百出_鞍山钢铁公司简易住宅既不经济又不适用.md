Poor Design Objectives and Numerous Errors
Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Simple Housing is Neither Economical Nor Practical

Last year, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company built 100,000 square meters of simple employee housing in Changdianpu. Due to the lack of economic accounting thinking among the leading cadres and designers of the Iron and Steel Company, and the unclear construction objectives, the design was very unreasonable, resulting in a lot of wasted funds.

After the leading cadres of the Iron and Steel Company determined the cost of this project, they impatiently required the design department to complete the design of all dormitories within ten days. As a result, the designers did not carefully consider the quality of the design and economic accounting issues, and rushed to meet the deadline day and night, resulting in numerous errors in the design.

The purpose of building simple housing is, on the one hand, to take care of the employees' welfare and enable them to have houses to live in quickly; on the other hand, to save investment as much as possible, so that the state can concentrate its efforts on building important projects. Therefore, before the construction, the company planned to use these simple houses for only five years.

Since it is "simple" housing, the building's land area should not be too large. However, the company's welfare department required the open space between the houses to be wider, so the designers followed orders and enlarged the distance between the houses from nine meters to thirteen or fourteen meters. As a result, the total land area of the simple housing reached 1.2 million square meters, while the building area was only 115,080 square meters, a ratio of ten to one, wasting land, extending road lines, and increasing road costs, transportation costs, sewer costs, outdoor lighting, and line costs.

Soviet experts said that according to the principle of "simplicity," this project does not need sewers. Because the life of the sewers is more than ten years, and these houses are only intended to be used for five years. To pour out wash water and kitchen water, digging wells is entirely possible. According to the Anshan Water Company's calculations, if water wells are used, setting up 30 public water stations for 3,700 households would be enough with 600 million yuan. However, the company decided to install sewers. The upper water system alone requires an investment of 5.9 billion yuan (later, the water workers came up with many methods, such as moving the water position closer to the foundation, using waste water pipes, etc., saving 1.7 billion yuan). If the houses are to be demolished within five years, although these water pipes cannot be completely discarded, most of the water supply pipes cannot be used.

These houses are planned to be demolished within five years, but some of the materials used can be used for more than ten years. The foundations, tile roofs, and ceilings of the houses do not meet the requirements of "simplicity." Therefore, the workers gave these houses a name, called "Five Expensive Houses": expensive foundations, expensive sewers, expensive brick walls (some are brick walls, the rest are mud walls), expensive cement tile roofs, and expensive ceiling plywood.

These designs also reflect the designers' very weak mass viewpoint. For example, the toilets are designed as centralized "dry toilets," arranged in a row of houses, a row of toilets, and the toilets are also on the side of the road. In hot weather, the stench is overwhelming, and workers have to cover their noses and mouths and run when walking on the street. At the same time, the toilet is fifty meters away from the house. Workers dissatisfiedly said: "Going to the toilet requires running a hundred meters round trip!"

Furthermore, ancillary facilities such as medical clinics, cooperatives, clubs, property management offices, and bathhouses are all designed in one corner of all the houses. Because there is a large road and a "roundabout" here, the designers considered how to make this "roundabout" "beautiful." However, workers have to travel more than two and a half miles to get here, which takes more than forty minutes for a round trip.

This design is also very irresponsible for the safety of the workers. The roof frame is made of wood, and a detailed construction drawing of the distance between the wooden roof frame and the chimney should have been designed. However, the designers did not do this, but irresponsibly wrote on the drawing: "Construct according to the construction regulations." In addition, the construction was sloppy, and the wooden roof frame was inserted into the chimney of the house, resulting in two fires recently.

When designing this project, the Iron and Steel Company limited the total cost to 40 billion yuan (excluding outdoor sewers), but now the total cost has reached 80 billion yuan. Including road costs, sewer mains, greening costs, etc., it is estimated that 100 billion yuan will be needed. In this way, the average cost per square meter is 800,000 to 1 million yuan, which is more than double the budget. However, the cost per square meter of the same simple housing built in Harbin last year was only 300,000 yuan. The 100,000 square meters of permanent standard housing built by the Iron and Steel Company in Lishan at the same time last year, in addition to sewers and indoor and outdoor lighting, also had heating equipment, double-layer windows, and toilets in the house that were flushed with water (the Changdianpu houses did not have these facilities), with a service life of more than 35 years, and the cost per square meter was only 1 million to 1.05 million yuan.

The Changdianpu housing project not only wasted a lot of state funds in design, but also the quality was so poor due to the irresponsibility of the construction unit that it was intolerable. Especially the latter added part last year, the foundation sank, and the walls collapsed. Workers lived in it for a few months and are now moving out. Some who have not moved out are also worried and afraid every day. When reporters from the Anshan Workers' Life News went to investigate, workers and their families rushed up to complain and unanimously demanded: "Look at our houses!" A worker said: "We are worried when we sleep, we have to sleep more vigilantly, otherwise we don't know when it will collapse and crush people!" The workers compiled a jingle for these houses: "Simple housing is really rough, people haven't entered the house yet, and the soil falls first!"

### 设计目的不明确错误百出  鞍山钢铁公司简易住宅既不经济又不适用

    设计目的不明确错误百出
    鞍山钢铁公司简易住宅既不经济又不适用
    鞍山钢铁公司去年在长甸铺修了十万平方公尺的简易职工住宅，由于钢铁公司的领导干部和设计人员缺乏经济核算思想，建设的目的不明确，以致设计十分不合理，浪费了很多资金。
    钢铁公司的领导干部在决定了这项工程的造价后，就急躁地限定设计处要在十天内完成全部宿舍的设计。于是，设计人员也就不仔细考虑设计的质量和经济核算问题，昼夜突击进度，结果做出来的设计错误百出。
    修建简易住宅的目的，一方面是为了照顾职工的生活福利，使职工们能很快地有房子住；一方面又要尽量节约投资，以便使国家能集中力量建设重要的工程。因此，在修筑之前，公司就准备这些简易住宅只使用五年。
    既然是“简易”住宅，建筑物的占地面积就不应该过大。但公司福利处要求房与房之间的空地要宽大些，设计人员也就遵命照办，把原设计房与房之间的距离由九公尺放大到十三公尺到十四公尺。以致简易住宅全部用地面积共达一百二十万平方公尺，建筑物占地面积只有十一万五千零八十平方公尺，比例为十比一，浪费了地皮，延长了道路线，又增多了道路费、运输费、上下水道费、室外照明和线路费。
    苏联专家说，按照“简易”的原则，这个工程是不需要上下水道的。因为上下水道的寿命有十几年，而这些房子只准备用五年。为了倒洗脸水和厨房用水，打水井是完全可以的。根据鞍山市自来水公司计算，如果用水井，三千七百户人家设立三十个公共水站，有六亿元就够了。但是公司却决定了要安装上下水道。仅上水道一项，就需要投资五十九亿元（后来由于水道工人们想出了很多办法，如把水道位置移近房基、利用废水道管等，少用了十七亿元）。如果住宅要在五年内拆掉，这些水道管虽然不能全部作废，但给水管大部分是不能使用的。
    这些房屋打算在五年内拆除，但是所采用的材料有的竟可用十几年。房屋的基础、瓦盖、天棚等都不合乎“简易”的要求。因此，工人们给这些房屋起了个名字，叫“五贵房”：基础贵、上下水道贵、砖墙贵（有一部分是砖墙，其余是土墙）、洋灰瓦屋顶贵、天棚胶合板贵。
    这些设计也反映了设计人员的群众观点十分薄弱。例如厕所设计的是集中的“旱便”，排列方法是一行住房、一行厕所，同时厕所又在马路的边上，一到热天，臭气冲天，工人们在街上走，就得用手堵着嘴鼻跑。同时，厕所离房屋有五十公尺远，工人不满意地说：“上趟厕所，一个来回得跑百公尺！”
    再如医疗所、合作社、俱乐部、房产管理所、澡堂等附属设施，都设计在全部住宅的一角。因为此地有一条大马路并有一个“转盘”，设计人员就考虑到怎样把这个“转盘”点缀得“漂亮”。可是工人到此地来办事，有的得跑出二里半地以外，一个来回需四十多分钟。
    这个设计对工人的安全也很不负责任。屋架是木料的，本应设计出木屋架和烟筒距离的施工详图。但是设计人员并没有这样做，只是毫不负责任地在图纸中写上：“按施工规程进行施工。”再加上施工马虎，竟把木屋架插在房屋的烟筒里，结果最近就发生了两次火灾。
    设计这个工程时，钢铁公司限定总造价为四百亿元（室外上下水道在外），现在总造价已达到了八百亿元，加上道路费、上下水道干管、绿化等费，估计需要一千亿元。这样，每平方公尺的平均造价就达八十万到一百万元，超过预算一倍多。而哈尔滨市去年修建的同样的简易住宅，每平方公尺的造价仅三十万元。钢铁公司去年同时修建的立山十万平方公尺永久性标准住宅，除有上下水道、内外照明外，还有暖气设备、双层窗户，厕所在屋内，是用水冲洗的（这些设备长甸铺住宅都没有），使用年限可达三十五年以上，每平方公尺也才用了一百万元到一百零五万元。
    长甸铺的住宅工程，不仅在设计上浪费了国家的大量资金，而且由于施工单位不负责任，质量恶劣得使人不能容忍。特别是去年后追加部分，地基下沉，屋墙坍塌。工人住了几个月，现在又往外搬。有些没有搬出的，也是天天耽心害怕。当鞍山工人生活报的记者前去调查时，工人和家属们纷纷围上来诉苦，一致要求：“看看我们的房子吧！”一位工人说：“我们睡觉都耽心，得睡得警醒些，不然说不上啥时候塌了砸了人！”工人给这些房子编了个顺口溜：“简易住宅真粗糙，人还没进屋，泥土就先掉！”
