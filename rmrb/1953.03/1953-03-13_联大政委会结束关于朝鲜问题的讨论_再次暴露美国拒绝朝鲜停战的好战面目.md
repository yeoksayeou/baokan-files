    Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: The Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, which reconvened in New York on February 24th, concluded its discussion on the Korean question in the Political Committee on March 7th. The characteristic of this discussion was that the United States consistently dared not put forward any new proposals, but continued to use the illegal resolution on the Korean question passed during the first half of this session of the General Assembly, attempting to shirk responsibility for the war with a low profile and cover up its conspiracy to expand the war in Korea and the Far East. However, the result of the discussion proved that the United States was unable to gain anything beneficial to itself from this discussion, and instead, once again exposed its true face of hostility to peace in the face of world public opinion.

    When the first half of the Seventh Session of the General Assembly adjourned last December, the United States originally intended to intensify its diplomatic and military deployments during the recess, so that when the General Assembly reconvened this year, it could use the United Nations' illegal resolution on the Korean question to pressure the Assembly to take further measures to expand the war. On the same day that the United Nations General Assembly passed the illegal resolution on December 3rd last year, the Associated Press predicted that the second half of the Assembly's session "will be asked to carry out the next stage of the plan originally proposed by the United States, namely the 'hard-line' stage, in which the member states of the United Nations should make greater contributions to the Korean War." However, the Eisenhower administration's clamor for expanding the war during the General Assembly's recess proved to have not only failed to intimidate the Chinese and Korean people but also intimidated itself. Eisenhower's publicly announced decision to attempt to use the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits in Taiwan to harass the Chinese mainland and his clamor for a so-called blockade of China aroused widespread protests from the people of all countries in the capitalist world and caused great doubt, dissatisfaction, and confusion among the ruling groups of these countries. On the eve of the reconvening of the United Nations General Assembly, many countries adopted a reserved attitude toward the adventurous measures that the United States might propose at the Assembly. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch on February 5th, some delegations openly stated that "the United States cannot hope that the member states of the United Nations—excluding the Soviet Union—will unanimously support it. They said that if such unanimity was difficult to obtain last December, then the convening of this Assembly will prove to be even more difficult than before." Rush, a columnist for the American "New York Post," also admitted that if the United States "takes a tough approach" at the Assembly, it "will prompt a large part of the non-communist countries, which have been frightened by Eisenhower's policies, to vote against or abstain." Under these circumstances, in order to avoid being completely isolated, the United States had to temporarily shelve its plan to demand that the Assembly take so-called hard-line measures, and instead changed its strategy, continuing to use the United Nations' illegal resolution as a shield to shirk responsibility and cover up its conspiracy to expand the war in Korea and the Far East. It was precisely based on this policy that when the American representative spoke on the Korean question in the Political Committee, he made no mention of what the United States intended to do in the future, but only slandered the Soviet Union and the Chinese and Korean sides, attempting to shift the responsibility for refusing a peaceful resolution of the Korean question to the Soviet Union and the Chinese and Korean people.

    However, this attempt by the United States did not succeed. The Soviet representative thoroughly exposed the conspiracy of the new American government to expand the war in Korea and the Far East through the United Nations platform, and proved with facts that the United Nations' illegal resolution was a tool used to cover up this action. In his speech, the Soviet representative once again proposed the suggestion of an immediate armistice in Korea and a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, but the American delegation still brazenly rejected this suggestion that could immediately achieve peace in Korea, which forced the United States to once again admit in the face of world public opinion that what it hoped for was not to stop but to expand the Korean War, thereby exposing its true face that it had originally tried its best to hide. On the other hand, it can also be seen from the process of discussing the Korean question that, although the United States still controls the voting machine of the Assembly, many countries cannot but be concerned about the strong call of the people of all countries for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. When the Political Committee voted on the Soviet proposal to invite representatives from Korea to attend the Political Committee and participate in the discussion, a total of twenty-two countries voted in favor or abstained. The United States barely managed to muster a majority to reject the proposal.

    Under these unfavorable circumstances, the United States feared that continuing the discussion would expose more flaws within its own camp, and therefore forced the Political Committee to hastily end the discussion on the Korean question after passing the routine matter of the so-called report on the "relief" work of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. At present, the United States is intensifying its plans to expand the war outside the venue of the United Nations General Assembly in order to create a fait accompli, and then pressure its vassal states to further support its aggressive policy. According to the American "New York Post," quoting "authoritative sources," the United States is preparing to use a "method that does not require United Nations approval" to exert "pressure" on the Chinese and Korean people, and to urge the American partners of the North Atlantic Group to follow this "tough" policy of the United States. The newspaper also said that if these methods fail to subdue the Chinese and Korean people, the United States is prepared to put forward some "truly tough proposals" at the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

### 联大政委会结束关于朝鲜问题的讨论  再次暴露美国拒绝朝鲜停战的好战面目

    联大政委会结束关于朝鲜问题的讨论
    再次暴露美国拒绝朝鲜停战的好战面目
    【新华社十二日讯】二月二十四日在纽约复会的联合国第七届大会，已于本月七日在政治委员会中结束了关于朝鲜问题的讨论。这次讨论的特点是，美国始终不敢提出任何一项新的提案，而是继续利用本届大会前半期会议所通过的关于朝鲜问题的非法决议，企图用低调来推卸战争责任，掩盖在朝鲜和远东扩大战争的阴谋。但是，讨论的结果证明，美国没有能够从这次讨论中得到任何有利于自己的东西，反而在世界舆论面前再次暴露出敌视和平的真面目。
    在去年十二月第七届大会前半期会议休会时，美国原打算利用休会期间在外交上和军事上加紧布署，以便在今年大会复会时，利用联合国关于朝鲜问题的非法决议，压迫大会采取进一步扩大战争的措施。合众社在去年十二月三日联合国大会通过非法决议的当天即曾预料，大会后半期会议“将被要求进行美国起初提出的计划中的次一阶段，即‘强硬’阶段，在这个阶段中，联合国各会员国应对朝鲜战争提出更大的贡献。”但是，美国艾森豪威尔政府在大会休会期间所作的扩大战争的叫嚣，证明非但没有吓倒中朝人民，反而吓倒了自己。艾森豪威尔公开宣布的企图利用台湾国民党残匪窜扰中国大陆的决定和关于所谓封锁中国的叫嚣，引起了资本主义世界各国人民的普遍抗议，并在这些国家的统治集团中间，造成了很大的怀疑、不满和混乱。在联合国大会复会的前夕，不少国家都对美国可能在大会上提出的冒险措施，采取保留态度。据法新社二月五日消息透露，某些国家的代表团公然表示“美国不能希望联合国会员国——苏联不计在内——会一致支持它了。他们说，如果在去年十二月里这样的一致性就很难得到，那么，这次大会开会的时候，会证明比以前更难以得到了。”美国“纽约邮报”的专栏作家拉许也承认，美国如果在大会上“采取一个强硬的方法……将促使那些被艾森豪威尔的政策所吓倒的一大部分非共产党国家投反对票，或是弃权”。在这种情况之下，美国为了避免完全陷于孤立，不得不把要求大会采取所谓强硬措施的计划暂时收起，转而改变策略，继续利用联合国非法决议作为挡箭牌，以便推卸责任，掩盖在朝鲜和远东扩大战争的阴谋。正是根据这种方针，美国代表在政治委员会就朝鲜问题发言时，绝口不谈美国今后打算怎样做，只是一味诽谤苏联和中朝方面，企图把拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题的责任推到苏联和中朝人民的身上。
    但是，美国这种企图并没有如愿以偿。苏联代表通过联合国讲坛彻底揭发了美国新政府在朝鲜和远东扩大战争的阴谋，并用事实证明联合国非法决议是用来掩盖这种行动的工具。苏联代表在发言中再次提出立即在朝鲜停战、和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，但是美国代表团仍悍然拒绝了这个能使朝鲜立即实现和平的建议，这就使美国不得不再次在世界舆论面前承认它所希望的不是停止而是扩大朝鲜战争，从而暴露了自己原来竭力隐藏的真面目。另一方面，在讨论朝鲜问题的过程中还可以看出，尽管美国仍然控制着大会的表决机器，许多国家不能不考虑到各国人民要求和平解决朝鲜问题的强大呼声而有所顾忌。在政治委员会表决苏联所提邀请朝鲜派代表出席政治委员会参加讨论的提案时，投票赞成和弃权的共有二十二个国家。美国勉强凑够多数，才否决了这个提案。
    在这种不利的情况下，美国害怕继续讨论下去会使自己的阵营内部暴露出更多的破绽，因而迫使政治委员会在通过所谓朝鲜统一复兴委员会关于“救济”工作的报告的例行公事之后，匆匆结束了关于朝鲜问题的讨论。目前，美国正在联合国大会会场以外，加紧筹划扩大战争，以便造成既成事实，然后压迫仆从国家进一步支持它的侵略政策。据美国“纽约邮报”引用“权威人士”的话说，美国正准备用一种“不需要联合国批准的办法”来对中朝人民施加“压力”，并促使北大西洋集团的美国伙伴们追随美国这种“强硬”政策。这个报纸还说，如果这些办法都不能使中朝人民屈服，美国就准备在联合国第八届大会上提出一些“真正强硬的建议”。
