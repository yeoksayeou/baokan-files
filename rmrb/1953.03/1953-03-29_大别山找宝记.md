    A Record of Finding Treasure in the Dabie Mountains
    Tian Bingshan
    Editor's Note: Comrade Tian Bingshan was an apprentice in a cloth shop before the national liberation. In 1950, he joined the Southern Anhui Cadre School and, after a short period of study, was assigned to the Geological Exploration Team of the Anhui Provincial Department of Industry. This article vividly describes his learning experience in geological exploration work.
        I. Learning Skills
    The term "resource exploration" was rarely heard of in the past. However, to meet the needs of national economic construction, I embarked on this new job. When the organization decided that I should do this work last April, I thought: even if I sat on a mine all day, I wouldn't know it was a mine! None of the comrades who went with me to explore iron ore in a certain place at that time were experts. We had to learn as we went.
    In the first job, we made a lot of jokes. Once, we went to the deep mountains to explore minerals. The team leader asked me to draw a map. I climbed the mountain for seven days and drew a topographic map of twenty miles around. Looking at that map now, it's enough to make my stomach hurt from laughing. A big circle for a big mountain, a small circle for a small mountain, and that was after six revisions. For more than two months, we ran around every day, like stonemasons, knocking on stones whenever we saw them, and brought back a large pile of specimens, colorful, more than a hundred kinds. Often, we mistook amphibole for iron ore, phlogopite for gold ore, and muscovite for silver ore.
    If we don't understand, if we can't do it, we must learn. We only have elementary school education, and we have to learn geology, chemistry... the difficulties are really many. Elements, nebulae, crustal movement..., we heard them confusedly. The captain said to us: "Resource exploration is to create conditions for large-scale economic construction. If we cannot discover and develop a large number of underground treasures, it will be impossible to build socialism. Comrades, we must complete learning skills as a political task." We responded to this call and studied hard.
    Two months later, we understood some geology and chemistry. We could name igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks, metamorphic rocks, hematite, and chalcocite.
    On August 19th, Professor Xiao Nansen of the Geology Department of Nanjing University and four students from Nanjing University set off with our team to the Dabie Mountains to find the underground treasures of the motherland. We brought compasses, magnifying glasses, 1:50,000 maps, and various instruments and tools into the deep mountains. On August 27th, it was my turn to scout ahead. Mr. Xiao showed me the map and asked me to draw the route map, and to record the types of rocks along the way, as well as the strike, dip, and dip angle of the veins. He wanted me to report to him the next evening. I panicked in my heart, thinking: how to do this?
    The next evening, as usual, everyone took a bath, lit candles, and Mr. Xiao was about to start the lesson. I thought he had forgotten, but as soon as he opened his mouth, he said: "Comrade Tian, ​​tell us about yesterday's work." I panicked in my heart, took out the specimen, opened my notebook, and before I could speak, I was sweating profusely. After I finished speaking, Mr. Xiao said: "Not bad. It's just that the strike of the vein in Yujiafan was mistaken. It is north by east thirty degrees, not north by west. In addition, diorite was also mistaken for granite." Then he talked about rock-forming minerals...
    Every day was like this, working during the day and learning at night. After more than fifty days, the comrades had greatly improved in geological theory and practical work. Generally, they understood geological structures, folds, faults, the identification of common rocks and minerals, and were able to use instruments. I also learned how to measure strike, dip, and dip angle.
    In our team, some used to do Party work in the countryside, and some were just transferred from the army. The highest level of education was only junior high school. Like me, I didn't even finish elementary school, but thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party, we all began to learn some prospecting skills and participated in the economic construction of the motherland.
    II. Mass Support and Assistance
    After our geological exploration team entered the Dabie Mountains, the local people always looked at us with surprised eyes wherever we went. Originally, our appearance was strange: each person holding a hammer, carrying a stone, what were we doing? The folks were talking in twos and threes: "What are they doing?" "Are they measuring the river!" "No, they are building roads, look at the hammers in their hands." Some said we were setting up telephone lines, and some even said we were blacksmiths, stonemasons. After we explained our intentions, they understood: "Ah! Chairman Mao sent them to find minerals. Chairman Mao is so thoughtful, distributing land and building reservoirs (referring to the Foziling Reservoir), and now he is looking for minerals. Nothing is not for the sake of our people." As long as we said we were looking for minerals, the masses immediately expressed their welcome: "Comrade, sit down at home." "Have a bowl of water before you go." It was unspeakably kind.
    When the masses heard that we were going into the mountains to find treasures, they came to assist us, forming a mass reporting of minerals activity. In Longjingchong District, Huoshan County, there was a cadre surnamed Huang who braved the rain to go to various villages to find stones for us to see, asking if there were any minerals. In Xiaotian District, Shucheng County, a militiaman saw the hematite specimen we brought and ran back three or four miles to carry a five or six pound stone to us, asking: "Is this a mineral?" Wherever we went, the masses showed great enthusiasm for developing resources. This shows that on the front line of national economic construction, our team is not just a few people, but all the people of the motherland.
    III. Facing Difficulties
    The working and living conditions of geological explorers are quite "bitter", but for the prosperity and strength of the motherland, we forgot the "bitterness" and further tempered ourselves in such work and life.
    Among the comrades in the whole team, except for Captain Liu, Mr. Xiao, Comrade Lao Jin and the cook, the rest were young and strong lads in their twenties. Especially Comrade Wang Jinfu, who was transferred from the army, he just put down his gun and picked up the hammer to participate in economic construction, working extra hard. When striking samples, he would lift a four-pound hammer and hit it more than a hundred times. His hands were always blistered upon blistered, but he still said: "It doesn't matter, it's much less difficult than the volunteer soldiers on the Korean front line." From departure to return, the big hammer never left his hand.
    Once, Li Qingyuan, a female student from Nanjing University, fell ill. If we stopped, it would affect the work; if we continued, it was the busy farming season, and we couldn't find any workers to carry her. Wang Jinfu, Zhao Changgeng, and Jiang Binghang all said: We'll carry her ourselves. Mr. Xiao was still worried that it wouldn't work, but everyone said: "It'll work! It'll work!" So, braving the rain, they carried Comrade Li Qingyuan across Tianzhu Mountain, which was 1,600 meters above sea level. If they accidentally slipped on the road and fell into the deep mountain stream, they would have lost their lives. On this day, everyone was soaked through, sweating when the sun came out, and drenched when it rained. When they arrived at the residence, everyone had blisters the size of steamed buns on their shoulders. But no one said a word, as if nothing had happened.
    Another time, we had to cross Mazongling, which was 1,200 meters above sea level. This mountain only had an ancient path. According to the local people, the anti-banditry troops walked it once in 1950, and no one had walked it for several years. There was no human habitation within thirty-five miles, not to mention eating, even drinking water was a problem. For the sake of work, we took steamed buns and water and went up the mountain. The reason we had the strength to conquer the hardships and difficulties in work and life was because the beautiful prospects of the motherland's construction were attracting us.
    In our work, if we discovered a mineral, the joy was simply indescribable. Once, A Zhang discovered a piece of malachite. After everyone studied it, they were sure that there must be a copper mine nearby. Then, Zhao Changgeng shouted: "Come on! A Zhang saw a copper mine!" "Where? Where?" Everyone ran over. After another "search", someone shouted: "I found it, a vein, north by east fifteen degrees." The other side also shouted: "North by east fifteen degrees, a vein!" Finally, four veins were discovered. Everyone sang! Danced! Happy! After a commotion, everyone excitedly talked about the prospects after the mine was built. Some advocated building a railway connecting to the Jinghan Railway, and some advocated building a light railway to the Yangtze River. Everyone had an idea, even what place to build the factory, what place to install the furnace, where to build the dormitory, and what the club would look like, everyone had planned it. Are these words empty? No! We firmly believe that these beautiful ideals will be realized. In those grassy slopes and high mountains, in the future, in the near future, new and magnificent factories will stand tall, huge chimneys will be spewing thick white smoke, and trains will be rumbling...
    We were able to overcome difficulties because the Communist Party members in our team set an example for us. Our captain Liu Kejun and Comrade Jing Bucheng were both Communist Party members. They were always working in front and resting behind. When climbing mountains and crossing rivers, they walked in front. When more samples were taken, they rushed to carry them; but when it came to eating and sleeping, they always let us go first. No matter how hard it was, they never complained. Sometimes, when the comrades' morale was low, they patiently persuaded and educated them. And they often explained the principles of socialist and communist construction to encourage our enthusiasm.
    We were able to overcome all difficulties smoothly because we were able to unite closely and help each other. Whether from cities, villages, factories or the army, we were like a family on this construction outpost. Mr. Xiao has always been sincerely and enthusiastically teaching us; when there were difficulties, everyone always helped each other.
                                × × ×
    The exploration work in the Dabie Mountains has come to a victorious end, and we are about to accept new tasks. But the days of working in the Dabie Mountains are unforgettable for me. This is not only because I learned some knowledge of geology there, but mainly because I did some meaningful work for the construction of the motherland. Because of this, I am happy, but I am never proud. I will continue to study hard, work hard, and better play the role of a screw in the large-scale economic construction of the country.

    大别山找宝记
    田秉山
    编者按：田秉山同志在全国解放以前是一个布店的学徒，一九五○年参加皖南干部学校，学习一个短时期后，分配到安徽省工业厅地质勘探队工作。这篇文章生动地叙述了他学习地质勘探工作的经过。
        一、学本领
    “资源勘探”这个名词，过去连听都很少听说过。可是为了国家经济建设的需要，我走上了这个新的工作岗位。去年四月，组织上决定我做这个工作时，我想：就是一屁股坐在矿上，也不知道是矿呀！当时和我一起去某地勘探铁矿的几位同志，也没一个是内行。我们只好边做边学。
    第一次工作中，闹了不少笑话。有一次，到深山里去探矿，组长要我画图，我爬了七天山，画了一张方圆二十里的地形图。现在再看那张图，简直可以把肚子笑痛。大山圈个大圈，小山画个小圈，就这还是经过六次修改才画成的。出去两个多月，每天东奔西跑，像石匠似的，见了石头就敲，搞回来一大堆标本，五颜六色，一百多种。往往把角闪石当成了铁矿，把金云母当成金矿，把白云母当成了银矿。
    不懂、不会、就要学。我们只有小学程度，要学地质、学化学……，困难实在不少。什么元素、星云、地壳运动……，我们听的糊里糊涂。队长对我们说：“资源勘探，是为大规模经济建设创造条件，我们如果不能发现和开发大量的地下宝藏，就不可能建设社会主义。同志们都要把学会本领当作政治任务去完成。”我们响应了这个号召，苦学苦练。
    两个月以后，我们对地质和化学都懂了一些。什么火成岩、水成岩、变质岩、赤铁矿、辉铜矿都叫得出来了。
    八月十九日，南京大学地质系萧枬森教授和南京大学四位同学会同我们队一起出发，到大别山去寻找祖国地下的宝藏。我们带上了罗盘仪、放大镜、五万分之一的地图和各种仪器、工具，进了深山。八月二十七日，轮到我打前站，萧先生把地图指给我看，要我画下路线图，记下沿途岩石种类和岩脉的走向、倾向、倾角。第二天晚上向他报告。我心里发慌，想道：这个文章怎样做呢？
    第二天晚上，和往常一样，大伙洗了澡，点上腊烛，萧先生要上课了。我以为他忘了，谁知他一张口就是：“田同志，你讲讲昨天的工作。”我心里一慌，取出标本，翻开小本子，还没讲，就急出了一头汗。讲完了，萧先生说：还不错。就是把俞家畈那条岩脉的走向弄错了，那是北偏东三十度，不是北偏西。另外，把闪长岩也误认为花岗石了。接着他又讲起造岩矿物……。
    每天都是这样，白天干，晚上学，经过五十多天，同志们在地质理论上和实际工作上都有了很大提高。一般都懂得了地质构造、折曲、断层、普通的岩石和矿物的鉴别，并且能使用仪器了。我也学会量走向、倾向、倾角了。
    在我们队里，有的是原来在农村中做党的工作的，有的是刚从部队中转业的，文化程度最高的不过初中程度，像我，连小学都没念完，可是由于有了共产党的领导，我们都开始学会了一些探矿的技能，参加了祖国的经济建设。
    二、群众的支持和帮助
    我们地质勘探队进了大别山之后，每到一处，当地群众总是用惊奇的眼光看着我们。本来，我们的样子也就让人奇怪：个个拿着锤子，背着石头，像个做什么的呢？老乡们都三三五五的谈论着：“这是干什么的？”“是丈河的吧！”“不是丈河，是修公路的，看他们手里拿着锤子。”有的说我们是架电话线的，甚至有人说我们是打铁的，做石匠的。经我们说明来意以后，他们就明白了：“啊！是毛主席派来找矿的。毛主席想的真周到，又是分地，又是修水库（指佛子岭水库），现在又要找矿了。没一件事不是为了咱人民。”只要我们一说是找矿的，群众都立刻表示欢迎：“同志，家里坐坐。”“喝碗水再走。”真是说不出的亲热。
    当群众听说我们是进山找宝的以后，还纷纷来协助我们，形成群众性的报矿活动。在霍山县龙井冲区有个干部姓黄，他冒着雨到各乡找石头给我们看，问有没有矿。在舒城县晓天区，有位民兵看见我们带去的赤铁矿标本，他回头跑了三、四里路，搬了块五、六斤重的石头给我们，问：“是不是矿？”我们所到之处，群众对开发资源都表现出了极大的热情。这说明在国家经济建设的战线上，我们的队伍不只是少数几个人，而是祖国所有的人民。
    三、我们在困难面前
    地质勘探工作者的工作条件和生活条件，都是相当“苦”的，可是为了祖国的繁荣和富强，我们忘记了“苦”，而且在这样的工作和生活中，进一步锻炼了我们。
    全队同志中，除了刘队长、萧先生、老金同志和炊事员以外，其余的都是二十三、四岁的年轻力壮的小伙子。特别是从部队里转业来的王金富同志，他刚放下枪杆，又抓起锤把参加了经济建设，干的分外起劲。打起标本来，他举起四磅重的锤子一打就是一百多下。手上总是血泡叠血泡，他还说：“不要紧，比志愿军战士在朝鲜前线的困难要小得多。”从出发到回来，那把大锤始终没离开他的手。
    有一次，南京大学的女同学李庆媛病倒了。如果停下不走，会影响工作；走吧，又正是农忙，找不到民工抬她。王金富、赵长庚、蒋炳行三个人一齐说：我们自己抬。萧先生还怕不行，大家都说：“行！行！”于是，冒着雨，把李庆媛同志抬过了拔海一千六百公尺的天柱山，路上要是一不小心滑倒了，掉到深山涧里就没命了。这天，大家都没穿过干衣服，太阳出来汗湿，下起雨来淋湿。到了住地，每人的肩上都起了馒头大的泡。可是没一个人吭声，好像没那回事一样。
    又有一次，要翻越一座拔海一千二百公尺的马鬃岭。这山只有一条古路，据当地群众说，一九五○年剿匪部队走过一次，几年没人走过。三十五里以内无人烟，不要说吃饭，连喝水都成问题。为了工作，我们带上馍和水就上了山。我们所以有力量来征服工作和生活中的艰苦和困难，是由于美丽的祖国建设的远景在吸引着我们。
    在我们的工作中，要是发现了矿，那股欢喜劲，简直没法形容。有一次，阿张发现了一块孔雀石，大家一研究，肯定附近一定有铜矿。接着，赵长庚就叫起来了：“快来呀！阿张看见铜矿了。”“在那里？在那里？”大伙都跑去了。又经过一番“搜索”，这边喊了起来：“我发现了，矿脉，北偏东十五度。”那边也叫了起来：“北偏东十五度，矿脉一条！”最后，四条矿脉，都被发现了。大家唱啊！跳啊！高兴啊！闹了一通之后，大家又兴奋地谈论起建矿以后的远景来了。有人主张修条铁路接连京汉路，有人主张修轻便铁路到长江边。一个人一个主张，甚至什么地方盖厂房，什么地方安装炼炉，宿舍盖在那里，俱乐部是个什么样子，大家都计划好了。这些话是空的吗？不！我们坚定地相信，这些美妙的理想一定会实现，在那些漫坡荒草和高山大岭中，将来，不久的将来就会矗立起崭新的雄伟的厂房，巨大的烟囱在冒着滚滚的白烟，火车隆隆的奔驰……。
    我们能够战胜困难，还因为我们队里的共产党员同志们给我们作了榜样。我们的队长刘克钧和景补成同志，都是共产党员。他们从来都是工作在前，休息在后。爬山过河，他们走在前面，标本打的多了，他们抢着扛；可是轮到吃饭睡觉，总是先让我们。不管怎么苦，他们从没有怨言。有时候，同志们情绪低落，他们就耐心地说服教育。并且时常讲解社会主义和共产主义建设的道理来鼓舞我们的热情。
    我们能够顺利地克服了一切困难，还因为我们能够紧密团结，互相帮助。不管是来自城市、农村、工厂或者军队，在这个建设前哨的工作岗位上，我们像一家人一样。萧先生一直是诚恳热情地教我们；有了困难，大家总是互相帮助。
                                ×  ×  ×
    大别山的勘探工作已经胜利结束了，我们就要接受新的任务了。但是在大别山工作的这一段日子，是使我难以忘记的。这不仅因为我在那里学会了地质学的一些知识，主要是在那里我为祖国建设事业做了一点有意义的工作。因为这个，我感到高兴，但我绝不骄傲，我将继续努力学习，努力工作，在国家大规模经济建设中更好地起一个螺丝钉的作用。
