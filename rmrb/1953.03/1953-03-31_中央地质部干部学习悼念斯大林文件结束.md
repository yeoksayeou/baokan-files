    Central Geological Department Cadres Complete Study of Documents Commemorating Stalin

    All cadres of the Central People's Government's Geological Department have focused their energy on studying the documents commemorating Comrade Stalin. When the news of Comrade Stalin's death reached the Geological Department, it caused extremely heavy grief in everyone. Vice Minister Liu Jie of the department suppressed his grief and called on everyone to transform grief into strength, to continue to advance for the construction of the motherland, and to inherit Comrade Stalin's cause. In the small memorial services held by Party and Youth League groups, almost every comrade swore to Comrade Stalin, determined to fight to the end for Stalin's cause. Many non-Party and non-Youth League members also expressed their determination at the memorial meetings of various departments, to strive to join the Party and the Youth League through practical actions in the future.

    This study was a conscious demand of everyone. Many comrades said: To inherit Comrade Stalin's cause, we must further understand Comrade Stalin's theory and Comrade Stalin's glorious life of striving for communism. Therefore, the Geological Department's study presented an unprecedented upsurge of learning. For example, in the General Affairs Section, in the past, many people had concerns about studying Marxist-Leninist works due to their limited education, but this time everyone was determined to overcome all difficulties to carry out the study, and even selected two comrades to go to the Xinhua Bookstore to buy books specifically. Many comrades also formulated specific study plans for the future after studying, such as Xiao Qi, director of the Party Committee Office, who planned to seriously study the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union this year.

    During the study, the General Study Committee of the Geological Department organized three reports. Vice Minister Liu Jie reported on Comrade Stalin's contributions in theoretical and practical activities; Director Liu Yi of the General Office reported on how to commemorate Comrade Stalin; and Comrade Gao Zhiqiu, director of the Secretariat of the Education Department, reported on Comrade Stalin's life. After these three reports, everyone further recognized the greatness of Comrade Stalin. At the study discussion meetings, everyone praised Comrade Stalin's great contributions to the world communist movement with infinite gratitude, and examined some of their past erroneous ideas and some unnecessary concerns after Comrade Stalin's death. Through this study, everyone more deeply understood the Soviet Union; and further realized that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is unbreakable and its strength is invincible.

    This study also clarified why we should learn from the Soviet Union, and strengthened everyone's enthusiasm for learning from the Soviet Union. For example, some comrades in the Geological and Mineral Resources Department were determined to learn Russian well and organized themselves automatically. They said: By learning Russian, we can better learn from the Soviet Union to realize Comrade Stalin's hopes for China and enable China to embark on the road of socialism faster like the Soviet Union.

    On March 25, the Geological Department's study of the documents commemorating Comrade Stalin has ended and has shifted to the study of "On Practice." (Wang Zuojiu)

    中央地质部干部学习悼念斯大林文件结束
    中央人民政府地质部的全体干部已集中精力学完了悼念斯大林同志的文件。当斯大林同志逝世的消息传到地质部的时候，曾引起了每个人极为沉重的悲痛。该部刘杰副部长抑止着悲痛的情感，号召大家要化悲痛为力量，为了建设祖国，为了继承斯大林同志的事业继续前进。在党团小组举行的小型追悼会上几乎是每个同志都向斯大林同志宣誓，决心要为斯大林的事业奋斗到底。很多非党团员在各司的悼念会上也都表示了自己的决心，要用实际的行动，争取将来入党、入团。
    这次学习，是大家自觉的要求。很多同志说：要继承斯大林同志的事业，就必须更进一步理解斯大林同志的学说和斯大林同志为共产主义奋斗的光辉的一生。因此地质部这次的学习呈现了从来未有的学习热潮。如总务科，在过去很多人由于文化程度的限制，对学习马列主义著作存在着顾虑，但这次他们大家都下了决心，克服一切困难来进行学习，还推出了两个同志专门到新华书店去买书。有很多同志在学习后，还订出了今后的具体学习计划，如党委办公室的萧琪主任计划要在今年认真学习联共党史。
    在学习中，地质部的总学委会曾组织了三次报告。刘杰副部长报告了斯大林同志在理论活动上和实际活动上的贡献；办公厅刘毅主任报告了怎样悼念斯大林同志；教育司秘书室主任高之秋同志报告了斯大林同志的生平。通过这三次报告后，使大家更进一步地认识了斯大林同志的伟大。在学习讨论会上，大家都以无限感激的心情，称颂斯大林同志毕生为世界共产主义运动所贡献出的伟大功勋，并检讨了自己过去的一些错误想法，和斯大林同志逝世后的一些不必要的顾虑。通过这次学习后，大家更深刻地理解了苏联；进一步认识了中苏两国人民的友谊是牢不可破的，其力量是无敌的。
    在这次学习中，也使大家明确了为什么要向苏联学习，加强了大家学习苏联的热情。如地质矿产司有些同志决心学好俄文，就自动地组织了起来。他们说：学了俄文，就可更好地学习苏联，以实现斯大林同志对中国的希望，使中国像苏联一样，更快地走上社会主义的道路。
    三月二十五日，地质部同志对悼念斯大林同志文件的学习已经结束，已转入了“实践论”的学习。 （王作九）
