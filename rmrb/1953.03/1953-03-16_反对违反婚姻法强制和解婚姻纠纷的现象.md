    A brief comment on political and legal work:

    To implement the purpose of the Marriage Law is to relieve the vast number of people from the various sufferings they have endured under the feudal marriage system, to enable them to live happily and produce vigorously. To achieve this goal, we should, for all kinds of marriage disputes, try our best to reconcile them and make them harmonious, and not rudely or arbitrarily "break them up," so as to avoid causing greater pain to the people. For families or couples who have no possibility of reconciliation, we should not force or compel reconciliation, because that would also cause greater pain to the people. In particular, compulsory mediation often causes great harm. The suicide of Tong Yangxi (child bride) Lin Yuchun is a painful lesson. Recently, some places in North China have also seen cases of deaths due to forced reconciliation, so this issue deserves great attention.
    The Party Central Committee and the State Council of the Central People's Government have instructed us to avoid rudeness and impatience in the movement to implement the Marriage Law, and not to adopt practices such as struggle, but to concentrate our efforts on propaganda and education. For marriage disputes, we should try to reconcile them as much as possible, and not deliberately break them up. But this does not mean that after the masses have filed for divorce, we can use simple and impetuous methods to forcibly reconcile those marriages that cannot be reconciled, resulting in increased suicides and murders of women; this is also not allowed.

    反对违反婚姻法强制和解婚姻纠纷的现象
    贯彻婚姻法目的，是要解除广大人民在封建婚姻制度下所遭受的各种痛苦，生活得愉快，生产得起劲。为达到这一目的，我们对于各种婚姻纠纷，应该是能和解的尽量和解，使之和睦起来，不要生硬地或随意地加以“拆散”，以免给人民造成更大的痛苦；对于没有可能和解的家庭或夫妇，也不必勉强地或强制地进行和解，因为那样也会给人民造成更大的痛苦。特别是强制性的调解，往往会造成很大的恶果。童养媳林玉春的自杀，就是一个沉痛的教训。最近华北有的地方也发生了因强制和解而弄出人命的案件，因此这一问题十分值得注意。
    党中央和中央人民政府政务院指示我们在贯彻婚姻法运动中避免粗鲁急躁，不许采用斗争之类的做法，而要集中精力去进行宣传教育，对于婚姻纠纷要尽可能和解，不要故意拆散。但这并不是说，当群众提出离婚要求以后，就可以用简单急躁的办法，强制和解那些不能和好的婚姻，以致增加妇女的自杀与被杀；这也是不能容许的。
