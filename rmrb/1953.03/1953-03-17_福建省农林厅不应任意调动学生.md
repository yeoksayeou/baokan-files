    The Fujian Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry Should Not Arbitrarily Transfer Students
    Ding You, Head of the Correspondence Group of Fuzhou Agricultural Technical School
    In January of this year, leading comrades of the Fujian Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry arbitrarily transferred a large number of students from our Fuzhou Agricultural Technical School to participate in off-campus work, which seriously affected teaching. The facts are as follows: Our school originally scheduled exams from February 5th to 8th and a holiday on February 10th. The exam and holiday dates for the graduating class were also the same. At the end of last December, the school suddenly received a notice from its superiors stating that because the provincial agricultural exhibition lacked manpower, the graduating class's exams should be brought forward to January 9th to 12th in order to transfer students to participate in the work. The school followed this instruction and brought forward the graduating class's exams by about a month. On January 13th, Shi Lin, Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and concurrently Principal of our school, wrote to the school saying that because there were too few explainers at the exhibition, students needed to be transferred to supplement them. As a result, all 240-plus students from seven classes, from the second semester of the second year to the second semester of the third year (graduating class), were transferred. A few days later, because the exhibition still lacked more than 60 cadres, Jiang Yizhen, Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, came to the school and transferred 68 students from the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science and Forestry Science departments of the first semester of the second year. In total, more than 300 students were transferred. In addition, on December 26th of last year, when the agricultural exhibition was still being set up, Cai Jingge, a staff member of the exhibition's secretariat, came to the school to mobilize more than 100 students to set up the exhibition venue.
    The result of this large-scale transfer of students was that most of our classes and grades were unable to complete the teaching plan. The graduating class's study time was suddenly shortened by about a month, so it was naturally impossible to complete the study plan at all; other students, upon returning from the exhibition, had to rush for the final exams, and teachers and students were busy preparing for the exams and could not properly make up lessons; the two classes that returned to school earlier could only use three days to make up for three weeks of lessons. In this way, the semester's coursework was hastily concluded. The number of class hours missed by more than 300 students in three weeks was considerable, and the loss in academic terms was great. After the incident occurred, teachers and students discussed it and expressed dissatisfaction. Everyone went to see Acting Principal Zheng Beiluan, who replied: "Principal Shi Lin sent a letter, and I should implement his opinion." He also said: "Director Jiang said this is much better than studying in school for a year and a half." He also said: "The agricultural exhibition is not held every year, how can it wait until we graduate?" Some teachers pointed out to him that this was a violation of the East China Military and Political Committee's instructions, and Zheng replied: "The regulations of East China should be 100% implemented in ordinary middle schools, but technical schools can be a little more flexible." These erroneous opinions of Acting Principal Zheng caused ideological confusion within the school, so that some students believed that it was okay for students to waste their studies and be arbitrarily transferred to participate in social work, and some students who stayed in school even became ideologically unstable, unwilling to attend classes, and hoping to go to work at the exhibition.
    This incident shows that the leading comrades of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry have serious bureaucratic tendencies and disregard for education work. The agricultural exhibition is a major event for the entire province, so why did the Department of Agriculture and Forestry not have a thorough plan in advance, so that when it was about to open (it opened on January 17th), there were still more than 300 explainers and other staff members lacking? Who gave the Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the preparatory organization for the agricultural exhibition the right to arbitrarily transfer students from the school on a large scale?
    After the incident occurred, teacher Huang Mingfu and others repeatedly wrote to the Fujian Daily to criticize it. However, this criticism did not receive strong support. After the Fujian Daily's reader来信组 (Letters from Readers Group) received the letters of criticism, it held a meeting to discuss it, and also affirmed that the Department of Agriculture and Forestry's approach was wrong, and sent cadres to the school to collect materials, reflecting the situation to the leaders of the Education Department and the Department of Agriculture and Forestry. After the Education Department learned about this situation, it originally sent people to the school to stop this action and asked the school负责人 (responsible person) to transfer the students back. Later, for some reason, the error was not corrected, and the Fujian Daily no longer insisted on criticism, so the problem was dragged on. However, I believe that the Fujian Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry's arbitrary and large-scale transfer of students to participate in off-campus work for a long time is wrong, and the department's leading comrades and other relevant comrades should conduct a profound self-criticism.

### 福建省农林厅不应任意调动学生

    福建省农林厅不应任意调动学生
    福州农业技术学校通讯组组长　丁佑
    今年一月间，福建省农林厅的领导同志，曾任意抽调我们福州农业技术学校的大批学生参加校外工作，严重影响了教学。事实经过是这样的：我校原定二月五日到八日举行考试，二月十日放假。毕业班考试和放假日期也是这样。去年十二月底，校方突然接到上级通知说，因为本省农业展览会缺乏人手，要把毕业班的考试提前在一月九日到十二日举行，以便调学生去参加工作。学校遵照这个指示，就将毕业班的考试提前了约一个月。一月十三日，省农林厅副厅长兼我校校长石林写信给学校，说因为展览会说明员太少，要调学生去补充，于是将二年级下学期到三年级下学期（毕业班）共七个班的二百四十多个同学竟全部调去。过了几天，因为展览会还缺六十多个干部，省农林厅厅长江一真又到学校抽调去了二年级上学期的畜牧兽医科、森林科共六十八个同学。前后共抽调同学三百多人。此外，在去年十二月二十六日，农业展览会还在布置的时候，该会秘书处工作人员蔡经葛就曾到学校动员一百多位同学去布置展览会会场。
    这次大批抽调学生的结果，使我们的大部分班、级没有能够完成教学计划。毕业班的学习时间既突然缩短了约一个月，自然就根本不能完成学习计划；其他各班同学，从展览会回来就要赶大考，教师、同学都忙于准备考试，也无法好好补课；回校较早的两个班，也只能用三天的工夫来补三个星期的课。这样，这学期的功课便草草结束了。三百多个同学在三个星期内缺课的时数是很多的，在学业上的损失是很大的。事情发生后，师生议论纷纷，都表示不满。大家去找代校长郑北銮，郑回答说：“石林校长来了信，他的意见我应该执行。”又说：“江厅长说这比我们在学校里学一年半年要好得多。”又说：“农业展览会不是年年有，怎么能等我们毕业后再开呢？”有的老师向他指出，这是违反华东军政委员会的指示的，郑回答说：“华东的规定，普通中学应该百分之百地执行，技术学校可就要有点伸缩。”郑代校长的这些错误意见引起了学校内部的思想混乱，以致有一部分同学认为学生荒废功课随便被调去参加社会工作是可以的，有些留校同学甚至思想波动起来，不愿上课，希望到展览会去工作。
    这一事件，说明了农林厅的领导同志有严重的官僚主义和轻视教育工作的思想。农业展览会是全省的大事情，为什么农林厅事先没有周密的计划，以致到将要开幕（一月十七日开幕）时，说明员及其他工作人员还差三百多人？是谁给了农林厅和农业展览会的筹备机构以权利，让他们任意到学校大批地抽调学生呢？
    事情发生后，教师黄明福等一再去信福建日报提出批评。但是这一批评没有得到有力支持。福建日报读者来信组收到批评信后，曾开会讨论，也肯定农林厅的做法是不对的，并曾派干部到学校收集材料，把情况反映给了教育厅和农林厅的领导方面。教育厅知道了这个情况后，本来已派人到学校制止这一行动，要学校负责人把学生调回。以后不知什么原因终于未见纠正这种错误，福建日报也不再坚持批评，问题就拖下来了。但是我认为福建省人民政府农林厅任意地、大量地抽调学生长期参加校外工作的做法是错误的，厅的领导同志以及其他有关同志应当进行深刻的检讨。
