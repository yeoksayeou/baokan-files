Xinhua News Agency, March 13th—The Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, together with the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, held a symposium on the patriotic health campaign in factories and mines on February 12th.

    At the symposium, representatives from various departments unanimously agreed that the main reason why the patriotic health campaign in factories and mines was not carried out effectively last year was that some factory and mine leaders did not sufficiently recognize the principle that doing a good job in the patriotic health campaign could ensure the completion of production tasks, resulting in a one-sided emphasis on production, regarding the launch of the patriotic health campaign as an extra burden. At the same time, due to unclear leadership relationships, some factories and mines unilaterally emphasized their own leadership system and did not obey the leadership of the local health authorities in carrying out the patriotic health campaign, making it impossible for the local patriotic health campaign committee to arrange work and conduct supervision and inspection. Some health authorities also abandoned their leadership over the patriotic health campaign in factories and mines within their regions, resulting in the poor implementation of the patriotic health campaign in the factory and mine systems. In addition, some factories and mines had problems with their working methods: some did not deeply mobilize the masses and did not establish sound grassroots health organizations; some factory and mine health clinics simply treated workers' illnesses and failed to carry out patriotic health propaganda and education to prevent diseases; others did not establish certain health systems to ensure regular propaganda and education, resulting in the inability to make health work a regular practice.

    In response to the above reasons, everyone proposed that: First, the leadership of the patriotic health campaign should be strengthened. The various ministries, bureaus, factories (mines) of each industrial system should establish patriotic health campaign committees according to the administrative leadership system. They should not have full-time personnel. The administrative heads, party branch secretaries, and trade union leaders should serve as chairpersons, and health personnel, youth league cadres, and other relevant personnel should be absorbed to participate in guiding the patriotic health campaign from top to bottom. At the same time, the patriotic health campaign in each factory and mine should be led by the directly affiliated superior patriotic health campaign committee of the business system, and should also accept the leadership and inspection of the patriotic health campaign committees in the respective areas, and carry out work in accordance with the unified arrangements of the patriotic health campaign committees in the respective areas. The directly affiliated superior patriotic health campaign committee and the patriotic health campaign committees of the respective regions can also jointly conduct inspections.

    When formulating the patriotic health campaign plan for factories and mines, attention should be paid to combining production with the patriotic health campaign, and combining work safety, worker welfare with the patriotic health campaign, according to the specific circumstances. The time for carrying out the patriotic health campaign should also be appropriately arranged according to the principle of being beneficial to production.

    中央爱国卫生运动委员会等部门举行座谈会
    决定加强领导工厂矿山爱国卫生运动
    【新华社十三日讯】中央爱国卫生运动委员会会同中央人民政府卫生部、中央人民政府重工业部、中华全国总工会等部门，在二月十二日举行了一个工厂矿山爱国卫生运动座谈会。
    在座谈会上，各部门代表一致认为：去年工厂矿山爱国卫生运动没有搞好的主要原因，是由于一些工厂矿山的领导人对搞好爱国卫生运动能保证生产任务完成的道理认识不足，以致单纯强调生产，把开展爱国卫生运动看做是额外的负担。同时由于领导关系不明确，有的工厂、矿山单纯强调自己的领导系统，而不服从所在地方的卫生机关在开展爱国卫生运动方面的领导，致使当地爱国卫生运动委员会无法布置工作和进行督促检查。也有些卫生机关，放弃了对本地区内厂矿的爱国卫生运动的领导，致使厂矿系统的爱国卫生运动开展得不好。此外，还有某些厂矿在工作方法上有问题：有的没有深入地发动群众，没有建立健全的基层卫生组织；有些厂矿卫生所单纯给工人治病，未能展开预防疾病的爱国卫生宣传教育；有的则没有建立一定的卫生制度，保证一定时间的宣传教育，致使卫生工作不能经常化。
    针对上述原因，大家提出：首先应加强爱国卫生运动的领导，各工业系统的各部、局、厂（矿）按行政领导系统都应成立爱国卫生运动委员会，不设专职人员，由行政首长、党支部书记、工会负责人担任主任委员，吸收卫生人员、青年团干部及其他有关人员参加，自上而下地指导爱国卫生运动。同时各厂矿的爱国卫生运动除由业务系统直属的上级爱国卫生运动委员会领导外，并还应接受各所在地区的爱国卫生运动委员会的领导和检查，根据所在地区爱国卫生运动委员会的统一布置进行工作。直属上级爱国卫生运动委员会和各该地区的爱国卫生运动委员会也可联合进行检查。
    在制订工厂矿山爱国卫生运动计划时，应根据具体情况，注意生产与爱国卫生运动相结合和作业安全、工人福利与爱国卫生运动相结合。对于开展爱国卫生运动的时间，也应根据对生产有利的原则，适当安排。
