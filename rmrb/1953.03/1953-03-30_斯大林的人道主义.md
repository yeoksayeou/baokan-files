Stalin's Humanitarianism
By Fadeyev, Soviet Union

I. "All revolutions in the past usually ended with one group of exploiters replacing another group of exploiters in power. The exploiters were replaced, but the system of exploitation remained. The October Revolution was fundamentally different from these revolutions. Its goal was not to replace one form of exploitation with another, or one group of exploiters with another, but to eliminate the phenomenon of exploitation of man by man, to eliminate all groups of exploiters..."

Stalin, the genius successor to Lenin's cause, thus defined the great humanitarian significance of the October Socialist Revolution in an article commemorating the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution.

In 1920, the British writer Wells, one of the last representatives of the old humanitarianism in the sense of bourgeois democracy, visited the new world for the first time—not the absurd world that revolved in his creations, but the real world created by Russian workers and peasants. Wells's visit was during its most severe period of hunger and cold. There were many reasons for the famine at that time, and the armed aggression and blockade of the Soviet Union by imperialist forces, primarily American and British imperialism, was one of them. Wells saw Moscow lying in darkness, and several ice-covered locomotives cooling on the roads, with workers only able to receive one-eighth of a pound of bread. Wells doubted the authenticity of the new world and called Lenin a "Kremlin dreamer."

In 1934, Wells visited our country for the second time. At that time, the socialist new world, relying on a developed industrial base and collective farms in the countryside, had begun to bring people the first material and cultural benefits. When Wells visited our country, the old world—the capitalist world—had just gone through the most serious economic crisis, and fascism had unfurled its black banner in Germany.

Wells saw "happy faces of healthy people" in our country, which was a "startling contrast" compared to what he saw in 1920. Some events in the world led him to make very correct observations about the capitalist world, saying that this world "is turning into a bloody swamp." However, Wells did not understand and could not explain why there were happy faces of healthy people in the Soviet Union, while the capitalist world had become a bloody swamp. Because he did not understand this point, he put forward a completely wrong program to save mankind from the bloody swamp.

Wells differed even from his "classical" predecessors. In his conversation with Stalin, he denied the existence of rich and poor in capitalist society, believing that this distinction was "oversimplified." Wells believed that Roosevelt's actions in the United States were aimed at creating a "planned," "socialist" economy, and he called for not emphasizing "the confrontation between the two worlds." Needless to say, Wells would not allow the capitalist system to be changed by violence, believing that this method was "old-fashioned" and that promoting this method was inappropriate, especially among technical intellectuals. According to Wells, the mission of technical intellectuals was to formulate constructive programs that combined capitalism and "socialism" into a general planned economy.

Wells's conversation with Stalin took place only a few years before World War II! Wells's attempt to point out a way for mankind to escape this situation proved that bourgeois humanitarianism had reached a dead end.

Comrade Stalin said to him: "Mr. Wells, obviously you start from the premise that everyone is a good person. But I have not forgotten that there are many bad people. I do not believe in the good intentions of the bourgeoisie."

The humanitarianism of Lenin and Stalin is fundamentally different not only from all forms of Christian humanitarianism, but also from all forms of the old "classical" humanitarianism in the sense of bourgeois democracy. The characteristic of the humanitarianism of Lenin and Stalin is that it is not a baseless humanitarianism of some "good intentions." No, it reflects the objective laws of social development, it reflects the interests and expectations of the working class, the hundreds of millions of working people, and the overwhelming majority of people who have the right to call themselves human.

Only by eliminating all forms of exploitation of man by man, eliminating all groups of exploiters, and establishing a socialist society through the dictatorship of the proletariat, can we bring, and have already brought, material and cultural benefits to the working people of all countries, without which truly human existence and development are impossible.

The starting point of Lenin and Stalin's doctrine is the inevitable and necessary violent removal of the minority of exploiters who block the path of mankind. These people not only do not want to give up "power" voluntarily, but, as the experience of our country and the people's democratic countries has shown, they resist madly, carry out cruel sabotage after failure, and are nurtured and supported by foreign exploitative forces.

The Soviet people will be forever grateful to the great Stalin, because Stalin educated them in the spirit of firmness, uncompromisingness and high political vigilance towards enemies at home and abroad.

This is one of the fundamental differences in principle between the socialist humanitarianism of Lenin and Stalin and all kinds of old bourgeois humanitarianism. Bourgeois humanitarianism is increasingly revealing itself as a force that attempts to cover up the ulcers of capitalism, whitewash imperialism, and provide moral defense for imperialism in the struggle against the exploited masses and against the overwhelming majority of people on earth.

The modern bourgeoisie abandons the banner of bourgeois democratic freedom and national independence, and it also abandons and defiles the old bourgeois humanitarianism. The modern bourgeoisie replaces it with open cannibalistic "theories," such as the neo-Malthusian doctrine that advocates the need to reduce the population of the earth, or the "theories" of racial superiority and national hatred, and consolidates these "theories" with facts such as the mass killing of people with napalm bombs, germ bombs, or atomic bombs.

The historical significance of Lenin and Stalin's humanitarianism lies not only in its fundamental difference from the old humanitarianism in the sense of bourgeois democracy, but also in the fact that it is the only modern humanitarian doctrine that points out the way for mankind to escape the shackles of capitalism and national oppression.

II.
Only the greatest humanitarian of our time could discover and express the basic economic law of modern capitalism and the basic economic law of socialism, objective laws whose discovery is a true victory for Marxist-Leninist science.

What a sharp, eagle-like gaze that watches the entire social development of modern times, what a great human heart that is used in the concise, strict, rational formula of these laws, as if engraved on copper!

They, like other laws of social development discovered by Comrade Stalin, occupy and consume his life—a life filled with heroic struggles and labor for the liberation and elevation of the working class and all working humanity.

The excessive taxes imposed on the people for the sake of armed aggression, the rising cost of living and wages reduced to the limit, unemployment, poverty, suffering, the blood, sweat and tears shed by the exploited masses for the most basic conditions of human survival, the stifling of national independence, the plunder of European countries and the direct robbery in dependent countries and colonies, the elimination of the most basic freedoms of bourgeois democracy and the persecution of progressive forces, racial persecution and massacres, the mockery of personality, the increase in mortality and the decrease in birth rates, the decline of education and the rampant propaganda of wild instincts, the artificial division of Germany into two parts and the enslavement of Japan, the corpses of Korean children and women lying on the land scorched by napalm bombs, atomic weapons and plague germs, all the dirty tricks, all the despicable filth and cannibalistic essence of modern capitalism—all this is to ensure the maximum profits of the contemporary masters of the capitalist world.

To harness the forces of nature on an unprecedented scale and on the basis of the highest technology for the benefit of mankind, the development of the free labor and initiative of the masses in building a new life, the continuous improvement of the people's living standards, the five reductions in prices, the seven-year universal education and the soon-to-be universal ten-year education, the development of advanced science, art, and literature, the liberation of all human spiritual forces, the actual complete equality of men and women, the continuous decline in mortality, the increase in birth rates and the unprecedented concern for children and their education in the world—the guarantee of fully satisfying the gradually increasing material and cultural needs of the entire society under socialism is expressed here.

Comrade Stalin dedicated his life to freeing the working masses from the poverty and ignorance they were forced to live in under conditions of exploitative society. Comrade Stalin taught: "...Socialism, Marxist socialism, does not reduce individual needs, but expands and develops individual needs as much as possible; it does not limit or refuse to satisfy individual needs, but satisfies all the needs of culturally advanced workers as much and as fully as possible."

Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, answered the slander of the bourgeoisie against socialism, who said that socialism would eliminate human individuality. No, it is precisely socialism that has all the possibilities for developing individuality. "...Collectivism, socialism, does not deny individual interests, but combines individual interests with collective interests. Socialism cannot be separated from individual interests. Only socialist society can give the fullest satisfaction to this individual interest. Moreover, socialism is the only solid guarantee for protecting individual interests."

Stalin developed the program of transition from socialism to communism in his brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR." Stalin's world-historic achievement is that he comprehensively studied the laws of social production and the laws of distribution of material welfare in socialist society, and he pointed out the path of gradual transition from socialism to communism.

This makes us also call Stalin, like other Marxist teachers, the greatest humanitarian among the famous humanitarians in the world.

Stalin inherited and developed Lenin's doctrine and expanded his cause. He permanently eliminated the shame of national oppression and national conflicts in our country, and created a new type of country based on the friendship of all nationalities.

Stalin gave the people of our country a program for creating socialist cultures in national forms.

It is precisely because of Stalin, the genius successor to Lenin's cause, that the cultural development of the various nationalities of our country—many of whom did not even have written languages in the old era—has surpassed that of the nationalities of the capitalist countries that were once considered the most advanced.

III.
Lenin and Stalin's doctrine on the Party as the leading and guiding force of Soviet society is of the utmost importance.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the embodiment of the wisdom, glory, and conscience of our time. The type of warrior and activist is cultivated first and foremost within the Party, and this type has increasingly become the most characteristic of a Soviet person—a person of socialist society, a builder of communism, a person who can be an example for all progressive humanity.

Stalin set high demands on Soviet activists, saying that the people expect them: "...to always be worthy of being Leninist political activists; to always be activists as distinctly defined as Lenin; to be as bold and fearless in battle and as relentless towards the enemies of the people as Lenin; to not panic or be flustered at all when things begin to get complicated and some danger appears on the horizon; to be as calm and composed as Lenin in solving complex problems, needing to carefully understand the environment, carefully consider all the pros and cons; to be as honest and loyal as Lenin; to love their people as Lenin did."

The image of the activist described by Stalin is the highest image of a person. It is precisely such people who enjoy the unlimited trust of the people. Stalin was such a person. These people who embody the characteristics of Lenin-Stalinist activists lead the Party and the entire Soviet people forward, realizing our world-historic tasks.

All the transformative and educational activities of our Party rely on a high degree of trust in the power of the people, on trust in people, in cadres, and on the limitless possibilities of people improving and perfecting themselves under socialism.

Stalin praised the Stakhanovite labor of our workers and collective farmers, and he elevated the significance of workers and peasants as creators of history and heroes of the new life. We must cherish and nurture people as gardeners cultivate their beloved fruit trees, these were Stalin's words. He also said, "Value cadres, regard them as the Party and the state's valuable assets, cherish them, respect them."

Stalin placed a high value on the role of women in Soviet society, and the Soviet youth justly regarded Stalin as their best friend. Stalin repeatedly pointed out the significance of young cadres and their sense of new things, and he emphasized the necessity of combining old cadres and young cadres in all our activities.

Stalin's role in the development of Soviet art and literature is extremely significant. No one defined the great humanitarian significance of literature as Stalin did, who saw literature as a force for educating and transforming people in the spirit of communism, and called writers engineers of the human soul. Stalin revealed and theoretically laid the foundation for the method of socialist realism in Soviet literature, and developed Lenin's doctrine on the Party spirit of Soviet literature. Stalin was the inspiration for all the Party's resolutions on literary issues. For thirty years, he guided the development of Soviet literature, inspiring it with new and newer ideas and slogans, exposing its enemies, caring for the training of writer cadres, encouraging them, and criticizing them.

× × ×

For nearly thirty years, we Soviet people, under the leadership of Stalin, have built our great socialist motherland. Under his leadership and direct military command, we resisted the fascist aggressors and defended our motherland. He dedicated his life, every drop of his blood, to the great love for the Soviet motherland, and he instilled in all of us Soviet people the great love that was in his heart. Stalin comprehensively developed the idea of Soviet patriotism put forward by Lenin, and gave a fatal blow to the lonely and helpless cosmopolitanism and kowtowing and groveling to the bourgeois West. Stalin instilled in the Soviet people a love for everything progressive in our country's past history and a sense of national pride, which is because our country is leading all the working people and all progressive people in the world in the struggle for a happy future for mankind.

Stalin said such great words about the position and significance of Soviet people in the world:

"Every ordinary Soviet citizen who has broken free from the shackles of capital is ten thousand times higher than any high-ranking official in foreign countries who is carrying the shackles of capitalist slavery..."

Stalin's humanitarianism has universal international significance. Stalin said, when talking about the task of elevating the working class—to which he dedicated his life: "This task is not to consolidate a certain 'national' state, but to consolidate the socialist state, that is, the internationalist state, and all the consolidation of this state helps to consolidate the entire international working class."

Stalin's last speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, this extraordinarily profound, clear, and broad speech, once again emphasized the international significance of our communist construction, and pointed out our close ties with the great Chinese people, the fighting Korea, the various people's democratic countries, and all the advanced and progressive forces in capitalist countries.

Stalin, the genius son of the working people, knew the hopes of the working people of all countries. Stalin's call to defend peace was their call. The people justly regarded Stalin as the first standard-bearer of peace. The Soviet government holds in its reliable hands the great banner of peace that Stalin left us. The people of the whole world can believe that this banner will fly on the earth regardless of the warmongers.

Great and pure man, his name expresses his indomitable spiritual strength. The kind teacher of mankind and the father of all nationalities has ended his life's journey, but his cause is invincible and immortal.

The sacred name of Stalin, which illuminates the path for all mankind, will shine forever! (Translated by Liu Jing from the Soviet "Pravda" on March 12, 1953)

### 斯大林的人道主义

专栏：

    斯大林的人道主义
    苏联  法捷耶夫
    一 “从前所有的革命，通常是以一个剥削者集团代替另一个剥削者集团执掌政柄而结束的。剥削者是更换了，但剥削制度依然存在。 “十月革命是在原则上与这些革命不同的。它的目的，并不是要用一种剥削形式代替另一种剥削形式，用一个剥削者集团代替另一个剥削者集团，而是要消灭任何人剥削人的现象，消灭所有一切剥削者集团……”
    列宁事业的天才继承者斯大林，在纪念十月革命十周年的文章中，就这样确定了十月社会主义革命的伟大的人道主义的意义。
    一九二○年，英国作家威尔斯，资产阶级民主主义意义的旧的人道主义的最后代表之一，第一次访问了新世界—不是他的创作里面所旋转的那个荒诞的世界，而是俄国工人和农民所创建的真实的世界。威尔斯的访问是在它饥寒最严重的时候。当时造成饥寒的有不少原因，而帝国主义的势力，首先是美英帝国主义的势力对苏联的武装侵略和封锁，就是原因之一。威尔斯看见了躺在漆黑中的莫斯科，披上了冰霜的几个机车头冷却在道路上，工人们只能领到八分之一磅的面包。威尔斯怀疑了新世界的真实性，把列宁称为“克里姆林宫的幻想家”。
        一九三四年，威尔斯第二次访问了我们祖国，当时社会主义的新世界已经依靠着发达起来的工业基础和农村中的集体农庄制，开始给人们带来第一批物质和文化的福利。威尔斯访问我国的时候，旧世界——资本主义世界刚刚经过了最严重的经济危机，同时法西斯主义在德国展开了它的黑色旗帜。
    威尔斯在我国看见了“健康人们的幸福的面孔”，这与他一九二○年所看到的比较起来是一种“使人惊奇的对照”。世界上的一些事件，使他说出了关于资本主义世界的很正确的见解，他说这个世界“正在变成血腥的池沼”。但是威尔斯并不了解同时也不能解释为什么在苏联有健康人们的幸福的面孔，而资本主义世界却成为血腥的池沼。因为不了解这一点，他提出了把人类从血腥的池沼中拯救出来的完全错误的纲领。
    威尔斯甚至不同于他的“古典的”先辈，他在与斯大林的谈话中，否认资本主义社会有穷富之分，他认为这种区分是“简单化了”。威尔斯认为罗斯福在美国的行动，就是为了创建“有计划的”、“社会主义的”经济，他号召不要强调“两个世界之间的对抗”。不言而喻，威尔斯不会允许用暴力改变资本主义制度的，他认为这种方法是“旧式的”，宣传这种方法是不适当的，特别是在技术知识分子之间，按照威尔斯的意见，技术知识分子的使命是制订把资本主义和“社会主义”结合在一个总的计划经济中的建设性的方案。
    威尔斯和斯大林的谈话只不过是第二次世界大战以前几年的事！威尔斯指给人类摆脱这种情况的企图的一筹莫展，证明了资产阶级的人道主义已是穷途末路。
    斯大林同志对他说过：“威尔斯先生，很显然，您是从一切人都是好人这个前提出发的。可是我还没有忘记：有很多坏人。我不相信资产阶级的善心。”
    列宁和斯大林的人道主义，在原则上不仅与所有的和各种形式的基督教的人道主义截然不同，而且与各种形式的资产阶级民主意义的旧的“古典的”人道主义也是绝对不同的。列宁和斯大林的人道主义的特点，在于它不是一些“善良心愿”的毫无根据的人道主义。不，它反映着社会发展的客观法则，它反映着工人阶级、亿万劳动人民以及仅仅有权自命为人类的那绝大多数人的利益和期望。
    只有藉助无产阶级专政来消灭人对人的各种剥削，消灭所有的各种剥削集团并建立社会主义社会，才能给各国劳动人民带来、并已经给我国人民带来物质和文化的福利，没有这些，真正人类的生存和发展是不可能的。
    列宁和斯大林的学说的出发点，是不可避免和必须以暴力扫除人类道路上的少数剥削者，这些人不仅不愿自动让出“权柄”，而且，正像我国和人民民主国家的经验所指出，他们疯狂地反抗，失败之后也要进行残酷破坏，并受到国外剥削者势力的养育和支持。
    苏联人民将永久感谢伟大的斯大林，因为斯大林以对国内外敌人的坚强、不妥协和高度的政治警惕性的精神教育了他们。
    这就是列宁和斯大林的社会主义人道主义与各种旧的资产阶级人道主义的根本原则上的区别之一。资产阶级的人道主义越来越暴露出自己是企图掩饰资本主义的溃疡、粉饰帝国主义，在反对被剥削群众和反对地球上绝大多数人民的斗争中为帝国主义进行道义上的辩护的这样一种力量。
    现代的资产阶级把资产阶级民主的自由和民族独立的旗帜抛在一边，它也把旧的资产阶级的人道主义抛在了一边并加以污蔑。现代资产阶级用公开的食人的“理论”，如新马尔萨斯学说所宣传的必须减缩地球上的人口或种族优越性和民族仇恨的“理论”代替了它，并用凝固汽油弹、细菌弹或原子弹等大量屠杀人的事实来巩固这些“理论”。
    列宁和斯大林的人道主义的历史性意义，不仅在于它根本不同于资产阶级民主主义意义的旧人道主义，而且在于它是给人类指出摆脱资本主义桎梏和民族压迫道路的现代唯一的人道主义的学说。
    二
    只有我们时代最伟大的人道主义者才能发现和表述现代资本主义基本经济法则和社会主义基本经济法则，客观法则，这些法则的发现是马克思列宁主义科学的真正胜利。
    注视着现代全部社会发展的是多么锐利的、鹰一样的目光，用在简洁的、严格的、合理的、好像刻在铜上的这些法则的公式上的，是一颗多么伟大的人类的心啊！
    它们也正如斯大林同志所发现的其他社会发展法则一样，占据和消耗了他的一生——这个充满了为解放和提高工人阶级及全体劳动人类而英勇斗争和劳动的生命。
    为了武装侵略军队而加在人民身上的过重捐税，高涨的生活费和降低到极限的工资、失业、贫困、苦难，被剥削群众为了人类生存最起码条件而流的血汗和眼泪，扼窒民族独立，掠夺欧洲各国和在附属国和殖民地的直接抢劫，消灭最起码的资产阶级民主的自由和迫害进步力量，种族的迫害和屠杀，嘲弄人格，死亡率的增加和儿童出生率的减少，教育衰落和大肆宣传野性本能，人工地把德国分成两部分和奴役日本，横卧在被凝固汽油弹烧焦了的土地上的朝鲜儿童和妇女的尸体，原子武器和鼠疫菌，一切肮脏的勾当，现代资本主义的一切卑鄙龌龊和食人的本质，——所有这些都是为了保证资本主义世界的当代主人的最高利润。
    为了造福人类在空前的规模和最高技术的基础上来控制自然力量，群众在建设新生活中的自由劳动和主动创造精神的开展，人民生活水平不断的提高，五次降低物价，七年制普及教育和不久将来的十年制的普及教育，先进的科学、艺术、文学的发展，人的一切精神力量的解放，男女实际上的完全平等，死亡率的不断下降，儿童出生率的提高和世界上从未有过的对儿童及其教育的关怀，——在社会主义条件下，充分满足全社会逐渐增长的物质和文化需要的保证，就表现在这里。
    斯大林同志的一生，都贡献给使劳动大众摆脱他们在剥削社会的条件下所被迫过的那种贫困和愚昧的生活。斯大林同志教导说：“……社会主义，马克思主义的社会主义并不是减少个人需要，而是要尽量扩大和发展个人需要，并不是限制或不肯满足个人需要，而是要尽量和完全满足文化程度很高的劳动者底所有一切需要。”
    列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林，回答了资产阶级对社会主义的诽谤，他们说好像社会主义会消灭人的个性。不对，正是社会主义才有发挥个性的一切可能。“…集体主义、社会主义并不否认个人利益，而是把个人利益与集体利益结合起来。社会主义是不能撇开个人利益的。只有社会主义社会才能给这种个人利益以最充分的满足。此外，社会主义是保护个人利益的唯一牢固的保证。”
    斯大林在他的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中发展了从社会主义过渡到共产主义的纲领。斯大林的全世界历史性的功绩就是，他全面地研究了社会主义社会的社会生产法则和物质福利分配的法则，他指出了从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的途径。
    这使我们也像称呼其他马克思主义的导师一样，把斯大林称为世界上有名的人道主义者中最伟大的一个人道主义者。
    斯大林继承和发展了列宁的学说并扩大了他的事业，他永远地消灭了我国的民族压迫和民族纠葛的耻辱，并创建了以各族友爱为基础的新型国家。
    斯大林给了我国人民创造民族形式的社会主义文化的纲领。
    正是由于列宁事业的天才继承者斯大林的缘故，我国各民族——其中许多在旧时代甚至连文字都没有——的文化发展已赶过了过去认为最先进的资本主义各国民族。
    三
    列宁和斯大林关于作为苏维埃社会的领导和指导力量的党的学说，具有最重要的意义。
    苏联共产党就是我们时代的智慧、光荣和良心的体现。战士和活动家的类型，正是在党内首先培养起来的，这种类型已愈益成为最可做为苏联人——社会主义社会的人、共产主义建设者、能够成为一切进步人类榜样的人——的特征的了。
    斯大林在苏维埃活动家面前提出了高度的要求，他说过人民期待着他们：“……要他们始终不愧为列宁式的政治活动家；要他们始终做一个像列宁那样明显确定的活动家；要他们像列宁那样在战斗中大胆无畏，对人民公敌毫不留情；要他们在事情开始复杂化，当地平线上呈现某种危险的时候，一点也不慌张，丝毫也不慌张；要他们像列宁那样丝毫也不慌张；要他们在解决复杂问题，需要周密认清环境，周密计较各个正反方面时，能够像列宁那样明哲镇定；要他们像列宁那样正直忠诚；要他们像列宁那样爱护自己的人民。”
    为斯大林所描述的活动家的形象是人的最高形象。正是这种人享有人民的无限信任。斯大林就是这样的人。这些体现出了列宁—斯大林式的活动家的特点的人们，领导着党和全体苏联人民前进，实现着我们全世界历史性的任务。
    我们党的全部改造的和教育的活动，是依靠着对人民力量的高度信任，依靠着对人、干部的信赖，依靠着在社会主义条件下人们提高和完善的无限可能性。
    斯大林赞美我们的工人、集体农民的斯塔哈诺夫式的劳动，他提高了作为历史的创造者和新生活的英雄的工人和农民的意义。必须爱护地培养人，就像园丁培植他所心爱的果树一样，这是斯大林的话。他还说过，“要重视干部，把他们视为党和国家的宝贵基金，爱护他们，尊重他们。”
    斯大林把苏维埃社会中妇女的作用提得很高，苏维埃青年公正地把斯大林当作自己最好的朋友。斯大林曾屡次指出了青年干部以及他们对新事物的感觉的意义，他曾强调指出在我们全部活动中把老干部和青年干部结合起来的必要性。
    斯大林在苏维埃艺术和文学发展中的作用是异常重大的。没有任何人像斯大林一样规定了文学的伟大的人道主义的意义，他把文学看作以共产主义的精神教育和改造人的力量，把作家称为人类灵魂的工程师。斯大林揭示出并在理论上奠定了苏联文学中社会主义现实主义的方法，发展了列宁关于苏联文学的党性的学说。斯大林是党关于文学问题的一切决议的鼓舞者。在三十年中，他指导着苏联文学的发展，以新而又新的思想和口号来鼓舞它，揭露它的敌人，关切地培育作家干部，鼓励他们和批评他们。
                     ×  ×  ×
    在近三十年期间，我们苏维埃人在斯大林的领导下建设了自己的伟大社会主义祖国。在他的领导和直接的军事指挥下，我们抗拒法西斯侵略者而保卫了自己的祖国。他因为对苏维埃祖国的伟大热爱，献出了自己的生命、自己的一点一滴的全部心血，他使我们全体苏联人养成他心中所有的那种伟大的热爱。斯大林全面发展了列宁所提出的苏维埃爱国主义的思想，并给孤寡无亲的世界主义和对资产阶级西方摇尾乞怜和卑躬屈节以致命的打击。斯大林使苏联人养成对我们祖国过去历史中一切进步事物的爱和民族自豪感，这种自豪是因为我们祖国领导着全体劳动者和世界上一切进步人士从事争取人类幸福未来的斗争。
    斯大林说过关于苏联人在世界上的地位和意义的这样伟大的话：
    “每一个摆脱了资本枷锁的最平常苏维埃公民，都比国外任何一个背着资本主义奴隶枷锁的大官显宦高出万万……”
    斯大林的人道主义具有普遍的国际意义。斯大林谈到提高工人阶级——他的一生都贡献给了工人阶级——的任务时说：“这个任务不是巩固某一个‘民族的’国家，而是巩固社会主义国家，也就是说，国际主义的国家，而且这个国家的一切巩固都有助于国际整个工人阶级的巩固”。
    斯大林在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的最后的演说，这个异常深刻地、明确和广阔的演说，又重新强调指出我国共产主义建设的国际意义，指出我们和伟大的中国人民、战斗着的朝鲜、各人民民主国家以及资本主义国家的一切先进的、进步力量的亲密的联系。
    劳动人民的天才儿子斯大林，知道世界各国劳动人民的希望。斯大林保卫和平的呼声就是他们的呼声。人民公正地把斯大林当作和平的第一个旗手。苏联政府把斯大林遗留给我们的伟大的和平旗帜握在自己可靠的手中。全世界的人民能够相信，这个旗帜将不顾战争贩子依然会在大地上飘扬。
    伟大而纯朴的人，他的名字就表达出他的不屈不挠的精神力量。人类善良的导师和各族人民的父亲虽结束了自己的生命之路，但他的事业是不可战胜的和不朽的。
    为全体人类照耀着道路的斯大林的神圣名字，将永世辉煌！（刘竞译自一九五三年三月十二日苏联“真理报”）
