Telegram of Condolence from the Chinese Academy of Sciences to the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences:

    In these sorrowful days of the passing of Chairman Stalin, the great revolutionary teacher of the world's people, we are further grieved to hear the news of the unfortunate passing of President Gottwald, the outstanding fighter of the international workers' movement and the most beloved leader of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Czechoslovak people. We vow, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, to further strengthen the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Czech peoples, to unite together in the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to strive to defend world peace, progressive culture, and the people's scientific undertakings.

                                Chinese Academy of Sciences
                              March 16, 1953
