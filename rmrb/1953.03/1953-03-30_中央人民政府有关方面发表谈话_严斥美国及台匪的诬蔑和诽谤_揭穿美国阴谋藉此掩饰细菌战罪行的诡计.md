Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: The United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs is scheduled to convene its eighth session on March 30th. In order to cover up its heinous crimes of waging germ warfare against the Chinese and Korean people, the US government has instigated the remnant clique of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionaries in Taiwan to submit a so-called "report" that slanderously accuses our country of large-scale manufacturing and selling opium and other narcotics, and fabricated the shameless rumor that the Soviet Union used opium as a loan to China. The United States also instructed the United Nations to include this so-called "report" in official documents and put it on the agenda for discussion. Xinhua News Agency reporters specifically interviewed relevant departments of the Central People's Government on this matter, who issued the following statement:

The US government, because its heinous crimes of waging germ warfare against the Chinese and Korean people have been thoroughly exposed by the Chinese and Korean people with irrefutable evidence, and have been met with angry condemnation from all sincere and just people around the world, is now in an extremely embarrassing situation. In order to extricate itself from this predicament, it has recently conspired to turn around and bite China and the Soviet Union, attempting to divert the attention of the world's people. It instigated the remnant clique of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionaries in Taiwan, under its protection, to submit a so-called "report" to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs, absurdly and groundlessly accusing our Central People's Government of massively manufacturing and selling opium and other narcotics. At the same time, it slanderously defamed the Soviet Union, saying that part of the Soviet Union's loans to China were repaid with opium. These baseless and malicious fabrications are not worth refuting.

Everyone knows that in the past, when the Kuomintang reactionary government ruled China, it did indeed vigorously encourage the planting, manufacturing, and selling of opium on a large scale, as one of the main means of poisoning the people and seeking personal gain and extortion. The several so-called "basic areas for manufacturing opium" mentioned in the "report" – namely Dalian, Rehe, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, etc. – were precisely the "basic areas" where opium was planted, manufactured, and sold on a large scale during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government in the past, and some of the areas were also during the Japanese invasion of China. However, after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the Government Administration Council promulgated the "Circular on Strictly Prohibiting Opium and Drugs" on February 24, 1950, and on November 1 of the same year, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government issued the "Order on the Promulgation of the Provisional Regulations on the Administration of Narcotics." As a result of the Central People's Government's vigorous prohibition of opium planting, manufacturing, and selling, and strict control of all narcotics for more than three years, these former "basic areas for manufacturing opium" have completely changed, and opium planting has long disappeared. Not only that, but throughout China, the planting, manufacturing, and selling of opium and other narcotics has been completely banned. No matter how hard the small remnant gang in Taiwan tries to fabricate lies, they cannot cover up the truth of these facts.

Everyone also knows that the loans granted to China by the Soviet Union in accordance with the Sino-Soviet loan agreement are used to pay for the machinery equipment and other materials purchased from the Soviet Union for industry and railways. Over the past three years, the Chinese people have been able to restore their economy so rapidly and surpass pre-war levels, and the selfless assistance of the Soviet people has been an important condition. Now, the small gang of bandits in Taiwan has the audacity to fabricate a rumor out of thin air that part of the Soviet loan was repaid with opium, vainly attempting to slander the great Soviet people and the Soviet government, and to slander the great and glorious friendship between China and the Soviet Union in front of the people of the world. It can be asserted that this conspiracy of the Taiwanese bandits is futile. It can neither deceive the just people of the world, nor can it damage the friendly relations between the two great allied nations of China and the Soviet Union. The buzzing of a stinking fly can never harm the prestige of the Soviet Union, which has stood like a lighthouse for more than 30 years, and is helping the people of the world and the people's democratic countries with a spirit of selflessness, equality, and cooperation!

The Chinese people firmly oppose the illegal discussion and dissemination in the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs of any and all base slanders and defamations by the Taiwanese bandits under the direction of the US government.

### 中央人民政府有关方面发表谈话  严斥美国及台匪的诬蔑和诽谤  揭穿美国阴谋藉此掩饰细菌战罪行的诡计

    中央人民政府有关方面发表谈话
    严斥美国及台匪的诬蔑和诽谤
    揭穿美国阴谋藉此掩饰细菌战罪行的诡计
    【新华社二十九日讯】联合国麻醉药品委员会定于三月三十日召开第八届会议。美国政府为掩饰其对中朝人民进行细菌战的滔天罪行，竟唆使台湾中国国民党反动派残余集团提出诬蔑我国大规模制造并贩卖鸦片等毒品的所谓“报告”，捏造苏联以鸦片作为对华贷款的无耻谣言；美国并指使联合国将这所谓“报告”编入正式文件和列入会议的讨论项目中。新华社记者为此特走访我中央人民政府有关方面，承发表谈话如次：
    美国政府，由于其对中朝人民进行细菌战的滔天罪行已经被中朝人民用铁案如山、无可辩驳的证据加以彻底揭穿，并已遭受到了全世界一切真诚的、有正义感的人士的愤怒斥责，因之为了解脱其现在所处的狼狈不堪的困窘境地，最近竟阴谋反噬中苏两国，企图转移世界人民的注意。它唆使在它卵翼下的台湾中国国民党反动派残余集团，在联合国麻醉药品委员会中提出所谓“报告”，荒诞无稽地诬蔑我中央人民政府大量制造和贩卖鸦片及其他麻醉药品；同时又血口喷人地诽谤苏联，说苏联对中国贷款中的一部分是用鸦片来偿付的。这些毫无根据的恶意的捏造，实在不值一驳。
    大家都知道，过去国民党反动政府在统治中国的时候，的确曾经大规模鼓励过鸦片的种植、制造和贩卖，作为毒害人民、营私横敛的主要手段之一。“报告”中所提的几个所谓“制造鸦片的基本地区”——即大连、热河、陕西、四川、云南、贵州、广东等地区，恰恰就是过去国民党反动政府统治时期、其中部分的地区也曾经是日本侵华时期大规模种植、制造和贩卖鸦片的“基本地区”。可是，在中华人民共和国建立之后，政务院即于一九五○年二月二十四日颁布“关于严禁鸦片烟毒的通令”，同年十一月一日中央人民政府卫生部又发表了“关于管理麻醉药品暂行条例的公布令”。由于中央人民政府三年多来大力严禁鸦片的种植、制造和贩卖以及严厉管制一切麻醉药品的结果，这些过去“制造鸦片的基本地区”早已完全改观，鸦片种植早已绝迹了。不仅如此，就全中国来说，鸦片及其他麻醉药品的种植、制造和贩卖也已完全禁绝。不管台湾那一小撮残余匪帮如何费尽心机地制造谎言，都是掩盖不了这些事实的真相的。
    大家也都知道，苏联根据中苏贷款协定所贷给中国的款项，是用以偿付自苏联购买工业与铁路的机器设备及其他器材的。三年以来，中国人民能够这样迅速地恢复自己的经济并使之超过战前的水平，苏联人民的无私的援助是一个重要的条件。现在台湾的一小撮匪帮竟然厚颜无耻地凭空捏造出一个什么苏联贷款一部分系以鸦片偿付的谣言，妄想藉这种卑鄙下流的诽谤来在世界人民面前中伤伟大的苏联人民和苏联政府，中伤中苏两国之间的伟大的光荣的友谊。可以断言，台湾匪帮的这种阴谋诡计是徒劳的，它既欺骗不了全世界的公正人民，也中伤不了中苏两个伟大盟邦的友谊关系。一只臭苍蝇的嗡嗡声绝对不能够损害那像灯塔一样业已屹立了三十多年，并正以大公无私、平等合作的精神帮助着全世界人民和人民民主国家的苏联的威望的！
    中国人民坚决反对在联合国麻醉药品委员会中非法讨论与散发美国政府指使下的台湾匪帮的一切和任何卑鄙的诽谤和诬蔑。
