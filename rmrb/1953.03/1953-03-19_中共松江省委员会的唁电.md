Telegram of Condolence from the CPC Songjiang Provincial Committee to the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party:

    We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Comrade Klement Gottwald, Chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Comrade Gottwald was the most beloved leader of the Czechoslovak people and a close friend of the Chinese people. He made outstanding contributions not only to the revolutionary cause of the Czechoslovak people but was also an outstanding fighter for the international cause of peace and democracy. His death is an irreparable loss to peace-loving people all over the world! To commemorate Comrade Gottwald, we will more firmly consolidate the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, strengthen the friendly unity between the Chinese and Czech people, and fight to the end for the cause of safeguarding world peace and security.

                        The Communist Party of China Songjiang Provincial Committee
