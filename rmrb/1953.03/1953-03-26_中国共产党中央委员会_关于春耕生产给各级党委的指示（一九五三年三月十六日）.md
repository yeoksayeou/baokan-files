The spring ploughing season is approaching, and spring ploughing production and preparation for ploughing should become the central tasks that override everything else in rural areas. Party committees at all levels must seize the agricultural season, organize and lead the broad masses of peasants to do a good job in spring ploughing, lay the foundation for this year's agricultural production, strive to make this year another bumper harvest year after three consecutive years of bumper harvests, ensure the needs of the people's food and industrial development, and create a good start in agriculture for the country's five-year plan for economic construction. To this end, the Central Committee hereby gives the following instructions:

    (1) On the basis of the victorious completion of the land reform, the agricultural production volume in 1952 has recovered and exceeded the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. This is a great achievement. However, in order to meet the needs of the continuous development of our country's industrial production, it is necessary to continuously and further improve the level of agricultural production, and we must never stop at the existing achievements. In the high tide of industrial construction, any view that ignores agricultural production is one-sided and wrong. The fact that some cadres who are in charge of rural work are not at ease in their jobs, blindly waiting for job transfers, and not actively striving to study how to lead peasants in doing a good job in agricultural production is a reflection of this one-sided view. To carry out the spring ploughing production movement, it is necessary to first solve the view of neglecting agricultural work in the minds of cadres. When allocating cadres, leadership organs should, in addition to transferring a large number of cadres to the industrial sector, retain a certain proportion of experienced leading cadres who have close ties with the masses at the county, district, and township levels as a key point, so that they can work with peace of mind and serve as the backbone for higher-level organs to lead rural work and cultivate new cadres. If cadres are transferred too quickly and in too large a number, it will inevitably hinder the leadership of rural work and agricultural production.

    (2) At present, there is a lot of work in rural areas, such as implementing the Marriage Law, rectifying and building the Party, preparing for the general election movement, reviewing land reform in some areas, and trying to build militia core regiments, etc.; in addition, some business departments one-sidedly emphasize their respective departmental work, and when they arrive at the county, district, and township levels, "everyone is a superior, everything is the center," "everything must be the responsibility of the chief, and the Party committee must guarantee," and do not allow the lower levels to arrange things in order of importance and urgency in a unified way. If this situation is not changed, it will inevitably lead to detachment from the masses and a delay in the agricultural season, seriously affecting spring ploughing production and causing irreparable losses. Therefore, the Central Committee has decided that the central task that overrides everything else in rural areas at present is to speed up the preparation for spring ploughing and start spring ploughing production. All other work must revolve around and be combined with spring ploughing production. Any work that affects and hinders the central task of spring ploughing production should be changed, postponed, or reduced, or even cancelled in its original plan. The Party committees and people's governments at all levels above the county level should, in accordance with the specific conditions of the locality, make unified arrangements for various tasks. Any task assigned to rural areas by any business department should be approved by the Central Committee or the local Party committee at the same level, or by the chairman, commissioner, or county head of the major administrative region or province, and should not be directly issued to the district or township, in order to effectively ensure the smooth progress of spring ploughing production. During the busy spring ploughing season, all meetings that hinder production should be stopped in rural areas, and rural cadres should not be arbitrarily transferred to higher levels to attend meetings or training courses, so as not to delay the agricultural season.

    (3) In order to correctly organize and lead the peasants and give play to their enthusiasm for production, it is necessary to resolutely correct the tendency of being impatient and rashly advancing in the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement that is currently growing. The specific manifestations of this tendency of being impatient and rashly advancing, in the new areas and areas with a poor foundation for the mutual aid movement, are mainly: attacking individual farmers, forcing them to join groups, and being satisfied with formalism. Some local work cadres, after the land reform has just ended, do not fully publicize the policy of protecting peasant ownership among the peasant masses, dispel the peasants' concerns about "fearing public ownership," and stabilize the peasants' production emotions, but blindly demand a large-scale development of mutual aid groups, transplanting the thinking and practices of land reform into the mutual aid and cooperation movement, emphasizing the satisfaction of the interests of poor peasants and hired laborers in the mutual aid groups, thus infringing on the interests of middle peasants and damaging the production enthusiasm of individual farmers who constitute the vast majority of the population in the new rural areas. In the old areas and areas where the organization is relatively widespread, the main tendencies of left-leaning rashness are: neglecting primary mutual aid groups, advocating the public ownership of land, livestock, and farm tools, blindly pursuing advanced forms, violating the Central Committee's guiding principle of trying out agricultural production cooperatives in a controlled manner, and being greedy for quantity and scale; innovating in the management methods within the groups and cooperatives, the more complex the better, the more "socialized" the better; in the issue of remuneration for land, livestock, and farm tools contributed to the cooperative, ignoring the characteristics of the current agricultural production cooperative being based on private property, and infringing on the private property of peasants, infringing on the interests of middle peasants, and not basing on the experience and level of the masses and the degree and needs of production development, blindly demanding an increase in socialist elements; excessively and hastily expanding public accumulation funds and public property, and even adopting a system of common consumption, etc. The peasant masses criticize these work cadres' practices as "taking steps that are too big, taking two steps as one"; they describe some agricultural production cooperatives as "a big stall, an empty foundation, a lot of debts, high output, and little dividends." In some individual places, serious phenomena of destroying production have even occurred, such as no one picking up manure in winter, no one engaging in sideline production, selling livestock, cutting down trees and killing pigs, and eating and drinking extravagantly. We must earnestly pay attention to all the correct criticisms of the peasant masses and correct all left-leaning adventurous mistakes. We must remind comrades that when organizing mutual aid groups and cooperatives, do not forget to proceed from the level of awareness and personal experience of the masses, from the actual demands of the masses, and from the production status of the small-scale economy, correctly solve the problem of combining the individual interests and public interests of the peasants, and advance steadily and in an orderly manner. Any impatient and rashly advancing policy will frustrate the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants and will harm spring ploughing production work, therefore it is extremely harmful. Abolishing freedom of hiring, freedom of borrowing, and freedom of trade in rural areas, and attempting to completely eliminate the possibility of the development of rich peasants, is also unfavorable to the development of production today, and is impossible. Of course, on the other hand, taking a negative attitude towards the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, letting things drift, allowing the spontaneous capitalist trend in the small-scale economy to run rampant, excluding poor peasants from mutual aid groups and cooperatives, causing poor peasants to suffer losses, not implementing the policy of equivalent mutual benefit for all group members and cooperative members, and the phenomenon of land dividend ratios being too high, causing those with more labor to suffer losses, all of these must also be corrected.

    (4) In carrying out the spring ploughing production movement, it is necessary to do a good job in organizing the issuance of agricultural loans and the supply and marketing of rural commodities. Agricultural loans must be rationally allocated to both organized peasants and individual peasants, as pointed out in the Central Committee's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation. It is not right to concentrate agricultural loans only on a small number of mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives, making a small number of advanced groups and cooperatives detached from the general mutual aid groups and the broad masses of peasants. Agricultural loans must be issued in a timely manner in accordance with the production season in various places, must be lent to peasants who have difficulties in production and request loans, must not be forced to apportion them, and must not excessively emphasize the earmarking of funds for specific purposes. The repayment period for loans should not be uniformly stipulated as borrowing in spring and repaying in autumn, but should be stipulated separately according to the different uses of the loans, some borrowing in spring and repaying in autumn, some repaying in one year, two years, or three years, or repaying in installments, and poor peasants who are indeed unable to repay the loans when they are due should be allowed to postpone repayment. In addition, freedom of borrowing among peasants should be allowed, and credit cooperation should be developed to supplement the inadequacy of agricultural loans from the state bank. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, due to the blockade of the liberated areas and the inconvenience of material exchange, it was beneficial for agricultural loans to be issued in kind to peasants. The situation is different now, and issuing in kind often cannot meet the specific needs of peasants. Therefore, in general areas, we should lend cash on the one hand, and on the other hand, rural supply and marketing cooperatives should organize the supply of means of production and means of livelihood in accordance with the needs of peasants at that time and in that place. County, district, and township supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned commercial organs above the county level should pay attention to improving the work of purchasing agricultural and sideline products and local specialties in the future, and vigorously increase the supply of means of production such as farm tools and fertilizers that are urgently needed by peasants at present, organize private handicraft workers to produce these means of production in large quantities, and help them solve the difficulties in the supply of raw materials (such as pig iron), and improve the supply of grain and agricultural machinery and medicines to areas producing industrial raw material crops. Local state-owned industries should pay attention to developing the manufacture of new and old farm tools and other means of production that meet the current needs of peasants, but should prevent blind development and overcome the phenomenon of crude manufacturing. The promotion of new-style farm tools must be combined with the specific conditions and actual needs of the locality, and the coercive command style in the promotion of new-style farm tools and rural supply and purchase work must be corrected. At the same time, the freedom of trade in the rural primary market should be guaranteed under leadership. It is wrong to prohibit or disguise the prohibition of private merchants from going to the countryside, and it is also wrong to mechanically restrict the development of supply and marketing or consumer cooperatives regardless of the actual situation in rural areas. Both must be corrected in order to benefit the development of rural production.

    (5) Since 1950, although there have been three consecutive years of bumper harvests, we are required to be more vigilant about the possibility of disasters. In the past three years, our country has made great achievements in controlling floods, but it cannot completely eliminate the invasion of natural disasters such as floods, droughts, pests, and diseases. We cannot be too optimistic because of the three years of bumper harvests. This year, we must especially strengthen the work of preventing and combating drought and preventing and controlling pests and diseases. In areas where rivers are a problem and in the south where there is a lot of rain, we must also pay attention to flood and waterlogging prevention. We should especially help solve the current difficulties in spring ploughing production in individual disaster-stricken areas, mountainous areas, old revolutionary base areas, and ethnic minority areas last year. In addition, in the patriotic production increase movement, some places only pay attention to a small number of high-yielding farmers, neglecting the assistance and leadership of the production of general farmers. This shortcoming should be corrected. Efforts should be made to improve agricultural technology. However, we must deeply recognize the regional nature of agriculture and the dispersion of the small-scale economy, and avoid mechanically applying so-called "science and technology" that are not suitable for local conditions and generally promoting certain technological improvement plans that are not suitable for regional characteristics. Agricultural scientific research institutions and technical guidance stations must go deep into the peasant masses, learn from the masses, find advanced technical experiences, original or newly created, that are suitable for local conditions, and then combine them with agricultural science and technology theories, summarize and improve them, and gradually promote them. Advanced agricultural technical experiences from other places and foreign countries must be first tested by agricultural scientific research institutions, state-owned farms, and county agricultural experiment stations, and excellent experimental results should be used to demonstrate and encourage peasants to voluntarily follow suit, and peasants must not be forced to experiment and promote them. The generalized and formulaic working methods adopted in recent years in improving agricultural technology, promoting improved varieties, and developing water conservancy irrigation, as well as the serious phenomenon of coercive commands promoted as a result, should be immediately stopped. Local Party committees should strengthen the leadership of state-owned farms, run state-owned farms well, and enable state-owned farms to truly play a demonstrative role among peasants.

    (6) In order to ensure the smooth progress of spring ploughing production and universally launch the patriotic production increase movement, the Central Committee requires every comrade of the prefectural committee, county committee, and district committee to study the Central Committee's resolution on mutual aid and cooperation, learn ordinary agricultural techniques, and, in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction of "from the masses, to the masses," summarize and improve the good production experiences of the peasant masses, and then promote them. Every comrade of the prefectural committee, county committee, and district committee must start from leading this year's spring ploughing production, constantly study and improve themselves, so that they can gradually become experts who can master the theory and policy of mutual aid and cooperation, understand ordinary agricultural production technology, and are good at contacting the peasant masses and leading agricultural production. In this way, the continuous development and improvement of agricultural production will be guaranteed, and our country's industrialization will be able to obtain the cooperation and support of agriculture. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China calls on the rural work departments of the Party at all levels, the prefectural committees, county committees, district committees, the Party organizations and Party members in rural areas, and the staff of the agricultural departments of the people's governments at all levels to seize the time and strive to do a good job in the spring ploughing production work in the first year of the five-year plan for economic construction.

    中国共产党中央委员会
    关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示
    （一九五三年三月十六日）
    春耕季节到来了，春耕生产工作和备耕工作应成为农村中压倒一切的中心工作。各级党委必须不误农时，组织领导广大农民，把春耕工作做好，为今年的农业生产打下基础，争取今年成为三年连续丰收后的又一个丰收年，保证人民食用与工业发展的需要，在农业方面为国家五年计划经济建设创造一个良好的开端。为此目的，中央特作如下的指示：
        （一）在土地改革胜利完成的基础上，一九五二年的农业生产量已经恢复并且超过了抗日战争前的水平。这是很大的成绩。但是，为了配合我们国家工业生产不断发展的需要，就必须同时不断地更进一步地提高农业生产水平，绝不能停留在现有成绩上不再前进。在工业建设的高潮之中，任何忽视农业生产的观点，都是片面的，错误的。若干担任农村工作的干部，不安心于自己的工作岗位，盲目等待转业，不积极努力钻研如何领导农民搞好农业生产，正是这种片面观点的反映。开展春耕生产运动，必须首先解决干部思想中这种轻视农业工作的观点。领导机关调配干部时，除必须转移大批干部到工业方面外，应有重点地在县、区、乡三级保留一定比例的较有经验及与群众有密切联系的领导干部，使他们安心工作，作为上级机关领导农村工作和培植新干部的骨干。如果抽调过急过多，势必妨碍对农村工作和农业生产的领导。
        （二）目前农村中的工作很多，例如贯彻婚姻法、整党建党、准备普选运动、部分地区的土改复查、试建民兵基干团等等；再加上某些业务部门片面强调各自的部门工作，到了县、区、乡以后，“人人是上级，事事是中心，”“样样都要首长负责，党委保证，”而不允许下面分别轻重缓急统筹布置。这种情况如不改变，势必脱离群众和违误农时，严重影响春耕生产，造成不可补救的损失。因此，中央决定，当前农村中压倒一切的中心工作是加紧春耕的准备工作和开始进行春耕生产，其他一切工作都必须围绕并结合春耕生产来进行，凡是影响和障碍春耕生产这一中心任务的任何工作，均应改变、推迟或缩小甚至取消原来的计划。由县以上的各级党委和人民政府根据当地具体情况，统一安排各项工作，任何业务部门向农村布置任务均应经中央或同级地方党委或各大行政区及省的主席、专员、县长批准，不得直接下达区乡，以切实保证春耕生产的顺利进行。在春耕农忙季节，农村中应停止一切妨碍生产的会议，亦不得任意抽调乡村干部到上面来开会或进训练班，以免违误农时。
    （三）为正确地组织领导农民，发挥农民的生产积极性，必须切实纠正农业生产互助合作运动中正在滋长着的急躁冒进倾向。这种急躁冒进倾向的具体表现，在新区和互助运动基础较差的地区主要是：打击单干农民，强迫编组，满足于形式主义的做法。有些地方的工作干部在土地改革刚刚结束以后，不在农民群众中充分进行保护农民所有制的政策宣传，解除农民“怕归公”的思想顾虑，安定农民的生产情绪，而是盲目要求大量发展互助组，把土地改革的思想和做法搬到互助合作运动中来，在互助组内强调满足贫雇农利益，因而侵犯中农利益，损害了在新区农村中占人口绝大多数的个体农民的生产积极性。在老区和组织起来的面比较广的地区，左倾冒进的倾向主要是：轻视初级互助组，提倡土地耕畜农具公有制，盲目追求高级形式，违反中央所指示的有控制地试办农业生产合作社的方针，而贪多贪大；在组内社内的经营管理方法上标新立异，越复杂越好，越“社会化”越好；在入社的土地牲畜农具的报酬问题上忽视目前的农业生产合作社是建立在私有财产基础之上的特点，而侵犯农民的私有财产，侵犯中农利益，不根据群众的经验水平与生产发展的程度和需要，盲目要求增加社会主义因素；过多过急地扩大公积金和公共财产、有的甚至采取共同消费的制度等等。农民群众批评这些工作干部的做法是“步子跨的太大，两步当做一步走”；形容某些农业生产合作社是“摊子大，底子空，债务多，产量高，分红少。”个别地方竟因而发生一冬无人拾粪，无人搞副业生产，出卖牲口，砍树杀猪，大吃大喝等破坏生产的严重现象。我们必须认真注意农民群众一切正确的批评，纠正一切左倾冒险的错误。必须提醒同志们，在组织互助组合作社时，不要忘记从群众的觉悟水平与切身体验出发，从群众的实际要求出发，从小农经济的生产现状出发，正确地解决农民的个体利益与公共利益的结合问题，稳步地循序而进，任何急躁冒进的方针都会挫折广大农民的生产积极性，都将损害春耕生产工作，因此都是极有害的。在农村中取消雇佣自由、借贷自由与贸易自由，企图完全排除富农发展的可能性，这在今天对发展生产也是不利的，而且是不可能的。自然，另一方面，对农业生产互助合作运动采取消极态度，放任自流，对小农经济中自发的资本主义趋势任其泛滥发展的倾向，在互助组合作社中排斥贫困农民，使贫困农民吃亏，对一切组员社员实行等价互利政策贯彻不够的现象，以及土地分红比例过高，使劳力多者吃亏的现象，这些也都是必须纠正的。
    （四）在开展春耕生产运动中，必须很好地组织农业贷款的发放工作及农村商品的供销工作。农业贷款必须按中央关于农业生产互助合作决议中所指出的，在组织起来的农民和个体农民两方面做合理的分配。如果不贷给单干农民，只把农业贷款集中贷给少数互助组和农业生产合作社，使少数先进的组社脱离一般的互助组和广大农民，这是不对的。农贷必须按照各地生产季节及时发放，必须贷给生产上有困难而要求贷款的农民，不得强迫摊派，不要过分强调专款专用。贷款的偿还期限不应一律规定春借秋还，而应根据贷款的不同用途，分别规定偿还期限，有的是春借秋还，有的是一年、二年、三年偿还或分期偿还，对到期确实无力偿还贷款的贫困农民并应准予缓期偿还。此外还应允许农民间的借贷自由，发展信用合作以补国家银行农业贷款之不足。在抗日战争与解放战争时期，由于解放区被封锁，物资交流不便，农业贷款采取贷放实物的办法对农民是有好处的。现在情况不同了，贷放实物反而往往不能适合农民的具体需要。故在一般地区应一面贷放现款，一面由农村供销合作社适应当时当地农民的需要组织生产资料和生活资料的供应。县、区、乡供销合作社和县以上的国营商业机关，今后应注意改进对农副土特产品的收购工作，并大力增加对农民当前所迫切需要的农具、肥料等生产资料的供应工作，组织私营手工业者大量生产这些生产资料，并帮助他们解决原料（如生铁）供应的困难，改善对工业原料作物区的粮食与农业药械的供应工作。地方国营工业应注意发展适合农民当前需要的新旧农具及其他生产资料的制造业，但应防止盲目发展，克服粗制滥造的现象。推广新式农具必须根据当地具体情况与实际需要相结合，纠正推广新式农具与农村供应和收购工作中的强迫命令作风。同时，应保证农村初级市场的有领导的贸易自由。禁止和变相禁止私商下乡是错误的，不顾农村实际情况，机械地限制供销或消费合作社的发展也是错误的，二者均须纠正，以利农村生产的发展。
        （五）一九五○年以来，虽然有三年的连续丰收，但要求我们对灾荒的可能性提高警惕。三年来我们国家在治理水患方面是有很大成绩的，但还不能完全免除水旱病虫等自然灾害的侵袭。我们不能因三年丰收而过于乐观，今年尤须加强防旱抗旱、防治病虫害的工作。在河流为患和南方多雨的地区，还要注意防洪防涝。对去年个别受灾地区、山区、老根据地和少数民族地区当前春耕生产中的困难，尤应大力帮助解决。此外，在爱国增产运动中，有的地方只注意少数丰产的农民，忽视对一般农民生产的帮助和领导，这种毛病应该改正。在改进农业技术方面应当努力去做。但必须深刻认识农业的地域性与小农经济的分散性，切忌机械搬用不适合当地情况的所谓“科学技术”与一般化地推行某些不适合地区特点的技术改进计划。农业科学研究机关和技术指导站必须深入到农民群众中去，向群众学习，找出适合当地条件的原有的或新创造的先进技术经验，然后结合着农业科学技术理论，加以总结提高，逐步推广。外地的和外国的先进的农业技术经验必须经农业科学研究机关、国营农场和县的农事试验场先行试验，以优良的试验成果示范农民自愿仿行，不得强迫农民试验推广。近年以来在改进农业技术、推广优良品种、发展水利灌溉等方面所采取的一般化和公式化的工作方法及因此而促成的强迫命令的严重现象，应该立予制止。地方党委应加强对国营农场的领导，把国营农场办好，使国营农场真能在农民中发挥其示范作用。
        （六）为着保证春耕生产的顺利进行，普遍展开爱国增产运动，中央要求每一个地委、县委和区委的同志学习中央关于互助合作的决议，学习普通的农业技术，按照毛泽东同志的“从群众中来，到群众中去”的指示，把农民群众好的生产经验加以总结提高，然后加以推广。每一个地委、县委和区委的同志要从领导今年春耕生产开始，不断学习，提高自己，使自己逐步成为能够掌握互助合作的理论政策，懂得普通的农业生产技术和善于联系农民群众、领导农业生产的内行。这样，农业生产的不断发展和提高就有了保证，我们国家的工业化也就能得到农业方面的配合和支援。中共中央号召党的各级农村工作部、地委、县委、区委、农村中党的组织和党员，号召各级人民政府农业部门的工作人员，抓紧时间，为做好五年计划经济建设第一年的春耕生产工作而奋斗。
