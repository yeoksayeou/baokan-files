    Comrade Stalin Will Live Forever in Our Hearts
    Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Zhang Ming
    The unfortunate passing of Comrade Stalin, our world's greatest leader and teacher, has caused me the deepest grief I have ever felt in my life.
    I still vividly remember the impressions left on me during our visit to Comrade Stalin's birthplace, Gori, in June 1951, as part of the Chinese youth delegation. From the simply furnished room where Comrade Stalin once lived, we understood how simple Comrade Stalin's lifestyle was in his youth. From his biography exhibition hall, I saw that Comrade Stalin was a good student from a young age, and had read Marx's works while still in school. From the place where he began his revolutionary activities, we imagined the tension and hardship of Comrade Stalin's organization of workers' strikes and leadership of student movements at that time. Comrade Stalin was arrested and exiled to Siberia for his revolutionary activities, but he always bravely persisted in the struggle.
    I also remember that the revolutionary history exhibition halls of Leningrad and Stalingrad recorded that Comrade Stalin personally commanded the poorly equipped Soviet army to defeat the well-equipped and numerically superior counter-revolutionary armies and foreign interventionists during the difficult years of 1918 and 1919. In the Moscow Museum, we saw a very moving oil painting, depicting the morning sun shining through the glass window into Comrade Stalin's office, but Comrade Stalin, who had worked all night for the happiness of the working people of the world and for the complete elimination of the fascist bandits, was still continuing to work and direct operations. Our great leader and teacher worked with such selfless spirit. All these exhibited great deeds made me deeply realize that Comrade Stalin is a banner of victory – wherever it is most critical, Comrade Stalin is there; where Comrade Stalin arrives, danger turns to victory.
    In the exhibition hall for Comrade Stalin's 70th birthday, I saw two hearts made of red cloth by a nine-year-old Soviet girl! On them were written: "Dear Comrade Stalin, one heart is my own, and the other heart is yours. My heart will always follow your heart." I think this heart not only represents the heart of this little girl, but also represents the hearts of all the people and children in the Soviet Union and around the world, because Comrade Stalin's name is inseparable from socialism and the cause of the liberation of all mankind. I also remember what the chairman of the Lenin Collective Farm in Ukraine said during our visit. He said: "All our achievements are the victory of socialism. During the war, the fascists destroyed our farm, and now we are rebuilding it at an astonishing rate. This is all due to the leadership of our Party and Comrade Stalin." This is how the Soviet people love Comrade Stalin.
    We Chinese people and the working people of the world also love Comrade Stalin in the same way. A mother in France sent Comrade Stalin the blood-stained watch of her son who sacrificed himself in the anti-fascist struggle. Another mother sent Stalin a hat left by her daughter who was burned to death in the war. These mothers will never forget the misfortune and pain brought to them by the war, and now they all pin their hopes for defending world peace on Comrade Stalin. An embroidery was embroidered with these words: "Comrade Stalin, I never want my son to fight the Soviet Union." These are such touching words. I myself also clearly remember that when we were in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, Comrade Stalin commanded the heroic Soviet army to achieve great victories in fighting German fascism. This was a great encouragement to us who were fighting behind enemy lines. We took the Soviet army as an example, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and with the help of the Soviet army's dispatch of troops to fight against Japan, defeated the Japanese fascist bandits. Comrade Stalin is like a lighthouse in the ocean, illuminating the path of struggle for the working people of the world. Today, just as the movement to defend world peace is continuing to develop vigorously, our dear teacher Comrade Stalin has bid farewell to us forever. What a huge loss this is!
    Here, I swear to Comrade Stalin: We must, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, resolutely advance in the direction you have indicated, study your great works, learn advanced Soviet military science and technology, skillfully master modern weapons of warfare and the command art of joint arms operations, and rapidly move towards regularization and modernization; forever together with the Soviet people, together with the peace-loving people of the world, we will completely smash the conspiracy of US imperialism to expand its war of aggression, and fight to the end to defend peace in Asia and the world, and for the bright future of communism!

### 斯大林同志永远活在我们的心里

    斯大林同志永远活在我们的心里
    中国人民解放军战斗英雄  张明
    我们全世界人民最伟大的领袖和导师斯大林同志的不幸逝世，使我生平第一次感到最沉重的悲痛。
    我还深深记得在一九五一年六月，我们中国青年代表团访问斯大林同志的诞生地——哥里时所留下的印象。从斯大林同志曾经居住过的陈设简单的房间里，我们想到了青年时代的斯大林同志的生活作风是多么简朴。从他的生平陈列室里，我又看到了斯大林同志从小就是一个好学生，还在学校读书时，就读了马克思的著作。从他开始参加革命活动的地方，我们想到了斯大林同志当时组织工人罢工和领导学生运动的紧张和艰苦情形。斯大林同志曾因革命而被捕流放到西伯利亚，但他始终英勇地坚持着斗争。
    我还记得，列宁格勒和斯大林格勒革命历史陈列馆，记载着斯大林同志在艰苦的一九一八年和一九一九年间，亲自指挥着劣势装备的苏联军队打败了装备优良和数量占极大优势的反革命军队和外国干涉者。在莫斯科博物馆里，我们看到一幅很动人的油画，上面画着：早晨的阳光透过玻璃窗照进了斯大林同志的办公室，但为了全世界劳动人民的幸福、为了彻底消灭法西斯强盗而工作了一夜的斯大林同志，还在继续工作和指挥作战。我们伟大的领袖和导师就是以这样忘我的精神在工作着的。所有这些陈列的伟大事迹，使我深刻地认识到：斯大林同志就是一面胜利的旗帜——那里最危急，斯大林同志就在那里；斯大林同志到了那里，那里就由危险转为胜利。
    在斯大林同志七十寿辰的陈列馆里，我看到苏联一个九岁的小姑娘用红布做的两颗心！在上面写着：“亲爱的斯大林同志，一颗心是我自己的，另一颗心是您的，我的心永远跟着您的心。”我想，这颗心不只是代表这一个小姑娘的心，而且代表着全苏联、全世界人民和孩子的心，因为斯大林同志的名字和社会主义、和全人类的解放事业是分不开的。我还记得我们在访问乌克兰列宁集体农庄时，农庄主席所说的一段话。他说：“我们一切的成绩，都是社会主义的胜利。在战争中法西斯把我们农庄破坏了，现在我们又以惊人的速度把它建设起来了。这都是由于有我们的党和斯大林同志的领导。”苏联人民就是这样热爱斯大林同志的。
    我们中国人民和全世界劳动人民，也同样地热爱斯大林同志。法国有一位母亲，将她在反法西斯斗争中牺牲了的儿子的血表，送给了斯大林。另一位母亲把在战争中被烧死的女儿遗下的一顶帽子，送给了斯大林。这些母亲们永远不会忘记战争带给她们的不幸和痛苦，现在她们都将保卫世界和平的希望寄托在斯大林同志的身上。有一幅刺绣上刺着这样几个字：“斯大林同志，我永远不要我的儿子和苏联作战。”这是多么动人的话。我自己也还清楚地记得，当我们在抗日战争中的时候，斯大林同志指挥着英勇的苏联军队在和德国法西斯作战中取得了伟大的胜利。这对正在敌后坚持斗争的我们是莫大的鼓舞。我们就以苏联军队做榜样，在毛主席的领导下，并在最后得到苏联军队出兵对日作战的帮助，打败了日本法西斯强盗。斯大林同志就像海洋中的一座灯塔，照耀着全世界劳动人民斗争的道路。今天，正当保卫世界和平的运动继续正在日益蓬勃发展的时候，我们亲爱的导师斯大林同志却与我们永别了，这是多么巨大的损失啊！
    在这里，我向斯大林同志宣誓：我们一定在毛主席的领导下，坚决朝着您指示的方向前进，学习您的伟大著作，学习苏联先进的军事科学和技术，熟练地掌握现代化作战的兵器和联合兵种作战的指挥艺术，迅速走向正规化和现代化；永远和苏联人民一道，和全世界爱好和平的人民一道，彻底粉碎美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的阴谋，为保卫亚洲及世界和平，为共产主义的光辉前途奋斗到底！
