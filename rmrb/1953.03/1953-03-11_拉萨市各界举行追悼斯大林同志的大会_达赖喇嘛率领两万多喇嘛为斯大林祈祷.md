Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The people of Tibet deeply mourn the death of Chairman Stalin. On March 9th, the Dalai Lama led over 20,000 lamas in prayers for Chairman Stalin, and people from all walks of life in Lhasa held a memorial meeting.

    After hearing the news of Stalin's death, the Dalai Lama of the Tibetan local government immediately followed the order issued by the Central People's Government on the 6th, ordering the Tibetan local government and the Tibetan local army to fly flags at half-mast from the 7th to the 9th to express condolences and to suspend banquets and entertainment. The Dalai Lama and Bainqen Erdini also sent telegrams of condolence to the Stalin Funeral Committee in Moscow. The Political Department of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army convened a forum of all personnel that evening, and everyone resolutely expressed their determination to transform grief into strength, continue to strengthen the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people, and crush the imperialist conspiracy to expand the war of aggression. The Political Office directly under the military region also convened a meeting of all Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members on the afternoon of the 7th, where the person in charge reported on Comrade Stalin's life and deeds and his sincere assistance to the Chinese people.

    On March 9th, the Dalai Lama led more than 20,000 lamas who came to Lhasa to participate in the Grand Summons Ceremony, and held a prayer meeting for the deceased and great Chairman Stalin at the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa with the most solemn Tibetan rituals. The head of the Tibetan Gelug school, Gadan Chi-ba, and senior officials of the Tibetan local government all attended the prayer meeting. Thousands of Buddha lamps were lit in the large and small Buddha halls of the temple, and various Dharma instruments were displayed. The prayer meeting began at 10 a.m. After the enforcement lama read the prayer text, a long and mournful prayer sound resounded throughout the temple. The prayer text said: "The leader and mentor of progressive people all over the world, Stalin, has passed away. This is a major loss for the people of the world. We pray to thank him for his great contribution to the cause of people's liberation during his lifetime; we pray for his ascension to the Western Paradise after his death; we pray for the everlasting friendship between China and the Soviet Union; we pray for lasting world peace and the close unity of all fraternal nationalities of the People's Republic of China; we pray for the increasing development and prosperity of Tibet." After the meeting, the Dalai Lama distributed alms to all the lamas who participated in the prayer.

    On the same day, more than 4,000 people from all walks of life in Lhasa held a memorial meeting for the great revolutionary teacher Comrade Stalin. The memorial meeting was chaired by Kalon Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme of the Tibetan local government. In his eulogy, he said: The great Chairman Stalin has left us forever! This is a painful event that the people of all ethnic groups in our country will never forget. Stalin gave the Chinese people great friendship, help and guidance, enabling us to get rid of the shackles of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, establish a big family of friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups, and live an equal and happy life. Today, as we mourn Chairman Stalin, the people of all ethnic groups must respond to Chairman Mao's call, strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups in the country, learn from the Soviet Union, follow the path indicated by the great Stalin, and build our great motherland. General Tan Guansan, Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region, reported on Comrade Stalin's glorious deeds throughout his life at the meeting. General Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, said in his eulogy: "Comrade Stalin has passed away, but we must turn our deep grief into the strength of unity and struggle to continue to accomplish the unfinished cause of Comrade Stalin." He called on the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet to unite more closely around Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party under the leadership of the Dalai Lama and Bainqen Erdini, together with the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, strengthen national unity, heighten vigilance, prevent the imperialists' conspiracy of sabotage, implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, learn from the Soviet Union, and consolidate the national defense of the motherland. Kalon Sohkang Wangchuk Deden, representative of the Tibetan local government, also delivered a eulogy at the meeting. He said: Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the monks and lay people have been familiar with and amiable to the name of Stalin, because his name symbolizes peace. In order to mourn the death of the great Stalin, all monks and lay people in Tibet are determined to be under the leadership of Chairman Mao, always be vigilant against the imperialists' conspiracy to provoke, consolidate the national defense of the motherland, and strive for lasting world peace. At the end of the meeting, the eulogies of the Dalai Lama and Bainqen Erdini were read in a solemn atmosphere.
