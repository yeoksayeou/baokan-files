    Strive to Learn Stalin's Military Science and Defeat the Enemy
    Zhao Baotong, First-Class Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Air Force
    The great Comrade Stalin has passed away! Every one of us Volunteer Air Force soldiers fighting on the Korean front feels extremely grieved.
    The image of the great Stalin is deeply imprinted in the hearts of each of us. His great life was entirely dedicated to the cause of human liberation. The Soviet people and the people of the world, following the path he pointed out, have achieved unparalleled and brilliant victories and are confidently striving for the victory of communist construction. Our great motherland, under the kind care, guidance, and support of Comrade Stalin, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, has also achieved revolutionary victory and is smoothly carrying out its vigorous construction. All this has made Stalin's great name deeply engraved in our hearts. At the front, we look at Comrade Stalin's picture every day; in battle, his name becomes a huge force encouraging us to bravely kill the enemy, and an infinite source of our confidence in victory. Therefore, when we heard the news of his unfortunate death, we could not help but feel great sorrow. We took out his picture, looked at it silently for a long time, and then wrote on the back: "At 9:50 AM on March 5, 1953, the revolutionary teacher of the world's people, the sincere friend of the Chinese people, the great Stalin, bid farewell to us forever! However, Stalin's immortal name will forever live in the hearts of the people. Let us always follow the direction indicated by Stalin and move forward!"
    Currently, American imperialists are frantically preparing to expand the war of aggression against Korea. In order to mourn Stalin's death, in order to defend the construction of our motherland and the peaceful cause of the people of the world, I vow to work harder with my comrades to learn Stalin's military science, heighten our vigilance, and as long as the enemy does not stop, we will resolutely fight the enemy until we completely eliminate the evil enemy!

    努力学习斯大林的军事科学，战胜敌人
    中国人民志愿军空军一级战斗英雄  赵宝桐
    伟大的斯大林同志逝世了！我们每一个在朝鲜前线作战的志愿军空军战士，都感到万分的沉痛。
    伟大斯大林的形象，在我们每个人的心里都是极其深刻的。他的伟大的一生，完全献给了人类的解放事业。苏联人民和全世界人民遵循着他所指示的道路前进，已经取得了无比辉煌的胜利，并正在满怀信心地争取共产主义建设的胜利。我们伟大的祖国，也正是在斯大林同志的亲切的关怀、指导和支持之下，在毛泽东主席和中国共产党的领导下，取得了革命的胜利，并顺利地进行着轰轰烈烈的建设事业。这一切就使斯大林的伟大名字深深地铭刻在我们的心里。在前线，我们每天都要看看斯大林同志的照片；在战斗中，他的名字也就成为鼓舞我们奋勇杀敌的巨大力量，成为我们的胜利信心的无限源泉。因此，当我们听到他不幸逝世的消息时，我们不能不感到极大的悲痛。我们把他的照片拿出来，默默地看着，看了很久，然后在背面写道：“一九五三年三月五日九时五十分，世界人民的革命导师、中国人民的真挚朋友、伟大的斯大林，和我们永别了！但是，斯大林的不朽的名字永远活在人民的心里。让我们永远遵照着斯大林所指示的方向前进！”
    目前，美国帝国主义者正在疯狂地准备扩大侵朝战争。为了悼念斯大林的逝世，为了保卫我们祖国的建设和全世界人民的和平事业，我发誓要和战友们一起更加努力学习斯大林的军事科学，提高警惕，只要敌人一天不罢手，我们就坚定地和敌人战斗下去，直到彻底消灭万恶的敌人！
