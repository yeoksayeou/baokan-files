Stalin's Profound Concern for Scientific Workers
    Chen Dake

    During Stalin's era, Soviet science achieved high development. Soviet scientific workers, continuing the excellent traditions of Russian scientific workers, propelled Soviet science to unprecedented prosperity. Whether in scientific departments or in technology, they achieved many significant results. Moreover, many achievements have greatly surpassed the scientific level of capitalist countries. For example, Michurin biology creatively developed Darwinism to a very high stage; Pavlov's physiology, studying the higher nervous activity of humans, laid a new foundation for medicine, pedagogy, and psychology; the theory of celestial evolution, on a solid scientific basis, correctly solved the problem of the origin of the Earth and planets.

    All these achievements of Soviet scientific workers are inseparable from Stalin's special concern for them.

    Stalin regarded scientific research as one of the most important departments in national life. As early as April 15, 1925, in his "Letter to the First All-Union Conference of Proletarian Students," he expressed great importance to scientific workers. Stalin pointed out: "General and Communist higher research institutions, workers' specialized schools, and technical colleges are furnaces for training leading personnel in economic and cultural fields. Students of medicine and economics, students of teachers' colleges and cooperative research institutes, students of mineralogy and statistics, students of higher technical schools and chemical institutes, students of agricultural science and civil engineering, students of veterinary medicine and forestry, students of electrical engineering and mechanics—these are the people who will lead the construction of a new society, the construction of socialist economy and culture in the future." In the article "The Year of the Great Turn," Stalin further pointed out that in order to carry out socialist construction, it is necessary to "absorb tens of thousands of technical personnel and specialists who support the Soviet regime to participate in the socialist construction cause," and to "cultivate new red technicians and red specialists from the working class."

    As a result of this emphasis, Soviet scientific institutions and scientific personnel have grown steadily year by year. Just citing some figures can illustrate this point. Soviet scientific research institutions, laboratories, and other scientific institutions numbered 1,560 in 1939, and increased to 2,900 by the beginning of 1952. The number of scientific workers almost doubled during this period. In 1952, there were more than 25,000 scientific workers being trained in the Academy of Sciences. In the Soviet Academy of Sciences alone, 2,500 postgraduates and doctoral students were being trained. The number of working staff in the Soviet Academy of Sciences now is almost sixty times higher than before the October Socialist Revolution.

    Stalin's concern for scientific workers was particularly important in arming Soviet scientific workers with his creative Marxist-Leninist theory and specifically paving the way for the broad development of Soviet science.

    Stalin first taught Soviet scientific workers that they must serve the people. He said that advanced science "is not isolated from the people, is not far from the people, but is determined to serve the people, determined to give all its achievements to the people" ("Speech at the Reception for Higher Education Workers in the Kremlin"). Therefore, Stalin pointed out that science must be linked to practice and must discover the laws of things from practice. He said: "Marxism understands scientific laws—whether referring to natural science laws or political economy laws—as reflections of objective processes that do not depend on people's will." ("Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR") The task of scientific workers is to "discover these laws, understand them, study them, take them into account in their actions, and use them to benefit society" (ibid.). Denying scientific laws is, in fact, denying science and will inevitably lead to unimaginable failures for science.

    Stalin taught all scientific workers that they must respect their traditions but also not be bound by them. He said: One should "understand the power and significance of the original traditions of science and be good at using these traditions for the benefit of science, but ultimately unwilling to blindly follow these traditions, and when these traditions tend to become stale and hinder its progress, it has the courage and determination to break the old traditions, old standards and old principles" ("Speech at the Reception for Higher Education Workers in the Kremlin").

    Stalin especially emphasized that scientific workers in all scientific departments must have a high level of political understanding and Marxist-Leninist consciousness. In the summary report on the work of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) at the 18th Congress of the CPSU(B), Stalin pointed out: "A Leninist must not only be an expert in the science he loves, but also a politician and social activist, actively concerned about the fate of his country, familiar with the laws of social development, good at applying these laws, and striving to become a person who actively participates in the political leadership of the country."

    Stalin also taught scientific workers that they must be good at carrying out criticism and self-criticism. He said: "Everyone admits that without different opinions, without free criticism, no science can develop, no science can progress." He also provided the most outstanding examples of criticism and self-criticism for scientific workers with his own classic works, such as "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics" and "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR."

    These great instructions of Stalin are an inexhaustible source of Soviet scientific development. Soviet scientific workers have drawn great strength from this inexhaustible source, helping scientific thought move further forward. As Comrade Malenkov pointed out in his report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, "Our science plays a huge role in promoting the further development of technology; it is helping the Soviet people to more fully understand and more effectively utilize the resources and power of nature with its discoveries. In the post-war period, our scientists have successfully solved many scientific problems of great national economic significance."

    Stalin often directly gave concrete practical tasks to Soviet scientific workers and gave them strong encouragement. On March 24, 1942, Stalin wrote in a telegram to Komarov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences: "I dare to express my conviction that, despite any difficulties in wartime conditions, the scientific activities of the Academy of Sciences will develop to the extent of the country's growing needs, and the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences under your leadership will complete all the important tasks facing the Academy." On April 12, 1942, Stalin wrote in another telegram to Komarov: "Hope that the Soviet Academy of Sciences will lead the innovation movement in the fields of science and production, and hope to become the center of progressive Soviet science in the struggle against the fierce enemies of our people and all freedom-loving people—the German fascist bandits. The Soviet government expresses its conviction that in the days of the great Patriotic War of the Soviet people against the German aggressors, the Soviet Academy of Sciences, headed by you, will gloriously fulfill its noble patriotic duties to the motherland." Stalin also paid great attention to the research work of many scientific workers. In the process of creating new wheat varieties by the outstanding agronomist Nikolai Vasilyevich Tsitsin, Stalin had always been concerned about his work. Stalin gave him such kind encouragement:

    "Be bold in your experimental work, don't be afraid of mistakes, we will support you!" Thanks to Stalin's care and support, Tsitsin's research finally achieved amazing results. He created many new wheat varieties, greatly increasing wheat yields and improving wheat quality. On April 27, 1939, Stalin personally met with Yakovlev, the famous Soviet aircraft designer, and gave him an award in person.

    This extreme concern of Stalin greatly encouraged Soviet scientific workers. They regarded the tasks assigned to them by Stalin as their sacred duty. Just like all other workers in the country, they underwent severe tests in those difficult years of the Patriotic War. Soviet scientific workers gloriously completed all the major tasks in the aviation, optics, machinery, transportation, and other departments raised by the war. Regarding these brilliant achievements, the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) gave extremely high praise at the celebration of the 220th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Academy of Sciences on June 16, 1945: "During the war, Soviet scholars carried out fruitful work and worked hard to help the motherland and the national economy. Soviet scientists have made an invaluable contribution to the cause of annihilating the enemy."

    However, Stalin did not allow Soviet scientific workers to feel complacent about this. In his historic speech on February 9, 1946, he further called on Soviet scientific workers to not only catch up with but also surpass foreign scientific achievements in the near future. This lofty mission is now encouraging Soviet scientific workers to more effectively promote the rapid advancement of Soviet science.

    Now, the great Stalin has unfortunately passed away. However, Stalin's immortal name will forever live in the hearts of every scientific worker. Soviet scientific workers know how to be grateful for Stalin's care for them. They will certainly make greater efforts to further promote the prosperity of Soviet science on the road illuminated by Stalin's thought, in order to fulfill their patriotic responsibilities.

    斯大林对于科学工作者的深切关怀
    陈大可
    在斯大林的时代，苏维埃的科学获得了高度的发展。苏维埃的科学工作者，继续了俄国科学工作者的优秀传统，把苏维埃的科学推向了空前未有的繁荣。无论是在那个科学部门，或者是在技术方面，他们都得到了许多重大的成绩。而且，有许多成绩已大大地超过了资本主义国家的科学水平。例如米丘林生物学把达尔文主义创造性地发展到了极高阶段；巴甫洛夫生理学研究人类高级神经活动的情形，奠定了医学、教育学和心理学的新基础；天体演化论在巩固的科学基础上，首先正确地解决了关于地球和行星的起源问题。
    苏维埃的科学工作者所有这些成就，都是和斯大林对于科学工作者的特别关怀分不开的。
    斯大林把科学研究视为国家生活中最重要的一个部门。还在一九二五年四月十五日，他就在“给苏联无产阶级学生第一次大会的信”中，对于科学工作者表示了极大的重视。斯大林指出：“一般的和共产党的高等研究机关，工人专门学校和技术专科学院，都是锻炼经济和文化方面的领导人材的熔炉。医学和经济学的学生，师范学院与合作研究所的学生，矿物学与统计学的学生，高级技术学院和化学研究所的学生，农科和土木工程科的学生，兽医学和森林学的学生，电学和机械学的学生，——这些都是将来领导建设新社会、建设社会主义经济和文化的人材”。在“大转变的一年”一文中，斯大林更进一步地指出，为了进行社会主义建设，必须“吸收成千成万拥护苏维埃政权的技术人材和专门家来参加社会主义建设事业”，必须“从工人阶级中间培养新起的红色技师和红色专门家”。
    由于这样重视的结果，苏维埃的科学机关和科学人材，有了逐年不断的增长。只要举出一些数字，就可以说明这一点。苏维埃的科学研究机关、实验室以及其他科学机关，在一九三九年为一千五百六十所，到一九五二年年初就增加到二千九百所。科学工作人员在这一段时期，差不多增加到两倍。一九五二年在科学院里培养着的科学工作者，共达二万五千多人。仅在苏联科学院里，就培养着二千五百个研究生和博士。现在苏联科学院工作干部的人数，比十月社会主义革命前差不多增加了六十倍。
    斯大林对于科学工作者的关怀，特别重要的，是以其创造性的马克思列宁主义理论，来武装苏维埃的科学工作者。并具体地为苏维埃的科学工作者铺设了广阔发展的道路。
    斯大林首先教导苏维埃科学工作者必须要为人民服务。他说，先进的科学，“是不与人民隔绝，是不远远离开人民，而是决意服务于人民，决意把自己的一切成果交给人民的”（“在克里姆林宫招待高级学校工作人员时的演说”）。因此，斯大林指出，科学必须和实践相联系，必须从实践中去发现事物的规律。他说：“马克思主义把科学法则——无论是指自然科学法则或政治经济学法则都一样——了解为不以人们的意志为转移的客观过程的反映。”
    （“苏联社会主义经济问题”）科学工作者的任务，就在于“发现这些法则，认识它们，研究它们，在自己的行动中估计到它们，利用它们来为社会谋福利”（同上）。否认科学法则的人，事实上就是否认科学，必将使科学遭到不可设想的失败。
    斯大林教导一切科学工作者都必须尊重自己的传统，但也不能拘泥于原有的传统。他说：应该“懂得科学原有传统底力量和意义，并善于为科学利益来利用这些传统，但终究不愿盲从这些传统，而当这些传统趋于陈腐而阻碍它前进时，它尽有胆量和决心来打破旧传统，旧标准和旧原理”（在克里姆林宫招待高级学校工作人员时的演说）。
    斯大林特别强调所有一切科学部门中的科学工作者，必须具有高度的政治水平和马克思列宁主义的觉悟。在联共（布）第十八次代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告中，斯大林指出：“列宁主义者决不能仅仅是他自己所喜爱的那门科学的专家，他同时还应当是政治家和社会活动家，积极关怀本国命运，通晓社会发展规律，善于运用这些规律，并力求成为积极参加国家政治领导工作的人。”
    斯大林还教导科学工作者必须善于展开批评与自我批评。他说：“谁都承认，如果没有不同意见，没有自由的批评，任何科学都是不可能发展，不可能进步的。”他更以自己的经典著作，如“马克思主义与语言学问题”、“苏联社会主义经济问题”，给科学工作者提供了批评和自我批评的最卓绝的范例。
    斯大林的这些伟大指示，是苏维埃科学发展的无尽泉源。苏维埃的科学工作者，从这无尽的泉源中，汲取了强大的力量，帮助科学思想更向前推进。正如马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告中所指出的，“我们的科学在促进技术的进一步发展方面起着巨大的作用；它正以它的发现来帮助苏联人民更全面地了解和更有效地利用自然的富源和力量。在战后时期中，我们的科学家已经成功地解决了许多具有巨大国民经济意义的科学问题。”
    斯大林经常直接给苏维埃的科学工作者提出具体的实践任务，并给以强烈的鼓舞。一九四二年三月二十四日，斯大林在致苏联科学院院长柯玛洛夫的电报上写道：“我敢表示确信，虽然在战时的任何困难条件下，科学院的科学活动，将在国家所日渐增大的需要程序上发展起来，在您领导下的科学院主席团，必将完成面临科学院的一切重要任务。”一九四二年四月十二日，斯大林在致柯玛洛夫的另一电报上写道：“希望苏联科学院来领导科学和生产领域内的革新运动，并希望在与我们人民和一切爱好自由人民的凶恶敌人——德国法西斯强盗——所展开的斗争中，成为进步的苏维埃科学之中心。苏联政府表示确信，在苏维埃人民反对德国侵略者的伟大卫国战争的考验日子中，以您为首的苏联科学院，必能在祖国面前光荣地完成了自己的崇高的爱国义务。”斯大林对于许多科学工作者的研究工作也给予了极大的注意。在出色的农业学家尼古拉·华西里维茨·齐辛创造新麦种的过程中，斯大林一直关心着他的工作。斯大林给他这样亲切的鼓励：
    “大胆做你的实验工作，不要怕错误，我们会支持你！”由于斯大林的关怀和支持，齐辛的研究终于得到了惊人的成果。他创造了许多新的麦种，大大提高了麦子的产量，并且改良了麦子的品质。一九三九年四月二十七日，斯大林曾亲自召见过苏联著名的飞机构造家雅可福烈夫，并当面给以奖赏。
    斯大林的这种极度的关怀，大大地鼓舞了苏维埃的科学工作者。他们把斯大林交给他们的任务，视为自己的神圣职责。也正如全国一切其他工作者一样，在那艰苦的卫国战争的岁月中，他们经受了严重的考验。苏维埃的科学工作者，光荣地完成了一切战争所提出的无数航空、光学、机械、运输等部门的重大任务。关于这些辉煌的功绩，一九四五年六月十六日苏联人民委员会议和联共（布）中央委员会，在庆祝苏联科学院成立二百二十周年纪念时，曾给以极高的评价：“在战争时期，苏维埃学者们进行着颇有成效的工作，并辛勤地帮助着祖国和国民经济。苏维埃科学家们，在歼灭敌人的事业中，付出了无可估计的贡献。”
    但是斯大林并不以此而使苏维埃科学工作者感到自满，他在一九四六年二月九日的历史性的演说中，更对苏维埃的科学工作者发出号召，要求他们在最近期间，不仅要赶上，而且要超过国外的科学成就。这个崇高的使命，现正鼓舞着苏维埃的科学工作者，更有效地推动苏维埃科学的迅速前进。
    现在，伟大的斯大林不幸逝世了。但是，斯大林的不朽名字，将永远活在每个科学工作者的心里。苏维埃科学工作者懂得怎样感激斯大林对于他们的关怀。他们必将在斯大林思想所照亮的道路上，以更大的努力促使苏维埃科学进一步的繁荣，来尽自己爱国主义的责任。
