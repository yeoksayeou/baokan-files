    In Longshan Village, Linkou County, Songjiang Province, cadres and farmers alike are happy to tell us the stories of three model military dependents: Wang Sumei, Lu Fengying, and Yu Guizhen. Farmer Yu Zhenjiang put it very vividly. Once, during a snowy winter, Yu Zhenjiang encountered a cart of oxen on the road. The wind howled, and the cart moved against the wind. The driver wore a large leather hat, covered in white frost, driving skillfully and energetically. Yu Zhenjiang couldn't help but exclaim to himself, "This young man is really capable!" But upon closer inspection, it wasn't a young man at all; it was Yu Guizhen herself driving the cart. She was hauling grain to Lishu Town, forty-five li away from home, to sell it. Such things have become quite commonplace for them.
    They not only actively participate in labor themselves but are also leaders and organizers in encouraging all the women in the village to participate in agricultural labor. The head of the Agriculture and Forestry Section of the Linkou County People's Government told us, "They have become the banner for the advancement of women in the entire village." Village Chief Li Sheng said, "These three women are the pillars of the village. With them, no task is impossible to complete."
    Among the three model military dependents, Wang Sumei is the youngest and most capable. After her husband joined the army, she single-handedly managed four hectares of land and never asked the masses to cultivate it for her. She has been repeatedly selected as a labor model and a military dependent model in the county. She cultivated and united Lu Fengying, Yu Guizhen, and other active women in the village, mobilizing everyone to participate in production and making all the women in the village recognize the glory of labor. Although Lu Fengying used to actively participate in labor herself, she was not as good at motivating others. Wang Sumei would often talk to her, recounting her own past hardships, discussing the current happy life and glorious status, and sharing the heroic deeds of her husband and the soldiers on the front lines. She would say, "They are protecting us on the front lines. If we don't work hard, how can we be worthy of them?" Through Wang Sumei's constant education, Lu Fengying also became more active and was selected as a model propagandist in the district in 1951. Wang Sumei, Lu Fengying, and Yu Guizhen often got together to discuss how to motivate everyone. For example, when collecting fertilizer, some women were afraid of the dirt, so they used the stories of the hardships endured by the volunteers on the front lines to encourage them. When hoeing, some people were afraid that women wouldn't be able to hoe properly, so they mobilized women to work hard to learn farming techniques; later, everyone in the village scrambled to ask the women to hoe for them. Now, not only young women in the village are participating in agricultural labor, but also five elderly women aged between fifty-seven and sixty-two are participating in summer hoeing and autumn harvest. During the autumn fertilizer collection last year, more than thirty women did fertilizer work just like the men. These young girls and daughters-in-law, barefoot and with rolled-up sleeves, shouted as they pulled oxcarts and horse-drawn carts onto piles of manure more than five feet high. As a result of everyone's active efforts, the entire village collected more than 2,700 carts of fertilizer and was named a first-class fertilizer model village in the county; after the autumn, the village was also named a first-class high-yield model village in the county.
    Wang Sumei is also very diligent in her studies. She used to be illiterate, but now she recognizes more than a thousand characters. Because of her outstanding achievements in leading the masses to participate in production, she was admitted to the Party in 1950 and elected as the secretary of the Youth League branch in 1952. Last November, she was promoted to director of the district women's federation.
    They all manage their family life very well. Take Yu Guizhen's family, for example. When her husband first joined the army, the family situation was still very difficult. Five people had only one quilt, and they didn't have enough clothes or shoes. They didn't even dare to put too much oil in their dishes. However, Yu Guizhen often used the glorious title of a Communist Party member and the family member of a revolutionary soldier to encourage and spur herself on. "A happy life doesn't come from nowhere; it's earned with both hands!" "My husband has joined the army. It's for the country and for a happy life in the future that I endure a little hardship." This belief supported her and enabled her to overcome all difficulties. She took on all the work inside and outside the house. Whether in freezing snow or sweltering heat, she was always busy. Planting, hoeing, going to the market, going to the store, she could do everything. When she returned home, she managed the housework very well, serving her mother-in-law and taking care of her son, making the whole family live comfortably. As a result of her hard work, her family has changed. Now they have a cart, five head of cattle of all sizes, several sets of clothes for each person, and they eat fine grains every other day. Her mother-in-law is also more affectionate towards her than before. She was elected as a labor model. When talking about her husband, she said happily, "When he was at home, we were still living a poor life; now my mother-in-law and I are leading a happy life with the children. I am worthy of him, and I have not failed the Party and the country's cultivation of me."
    Their exemplary behavior greatly encourages their relatives fighting on the front lines. When we visited Lu Fengying's home, the first thing that caught our attention was the photograph hanging on the wall of her and her handsome husband holding their child. Pointing to the photo, she told us with pride and excitement, "He has sent me two citations for merit!"
    She told us about a conversation she had with her husband, Li Chengkui, during a meeting last year. She said, "He asked me, 'Have you joined the Party?' I said, 'Not yet!' He encouraged me and told me to strive to join the Party as soon as possible. He also told me about the circumstances of his joining the Party. I saw that he had changed a lot, become more knowledgeable, and more emotional. He asked me, 'Do you miss me coming home?' I said, 'I miss you, but I don't want you to come back now. The country needs you. Who doesn't have family? If everyone wanted their family members to come home, then no one would protect the country, and we wouldn't be able to protect our good life!' He kept nodding and smiling as I spoke. I saw that he had become even stronger. Before I left, I promised him, 'I will definitely give you good news in 1952.'"
    Lu Fengying's promise came true. In December 1952, this advanced Youth League member gloriously joined the Communist Party. She was also elected as the director of the village women's federation and the deputy director of the newly established agricultural production cooperative, leading the farmers towards collectivization. At the time, she was so excited that she even dreamed of writing letters to her husband at night.
    "Dear Comrade Chengkui: I have fulfilled your wish and am now a glorious Communist Party member. Our village's production is booming, and we have established an agricultural production cooperative. I was elected as the deputy director. Our family's life is also better than before. But this is just the beginning. Even happier days are ahead. When you return victoriously in the future, perhaps our village has already become a collective farm. I am constantly progressing, and maybe I will be the chairman of the collective farm. At that time, there will be electric lights, and machines will be used to farm the land. We will no longer use old oxen to plow the land."
    Lu Fengying said that this draft of the letter was what she was thinking about writing in her dreams. Later, when writing the letter, she added a paragraph: "Since the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, the village has become even more lovely. The small river in front of the door provides convenient drinking water for livestock like tap water in spring, summer, and autumn. The more than one hundred hectares of land between the southeast and northwest mountains have been connected into one piece this year, which will be good for using tractors to farm the land in the future!" She said that she also wrote at the end of the letter: "When you come back, I will go far away to meet you. I hope the person I pick up is a combat hero."
    When we visited these model military dependents, we asked them with a smile during the conversation, "Do you miss them?" "We're not wooden blocks; who wouldn't miss their loved ones?" This was Comrade Wang Sumei's reply. She continued, "But we must make revolution. We can't stop making revolution just because we miss him. It is precisely because we miss him, love him, and hope that he will return victoriously as soon as possible that we work even harder! When the country is built stronger and imperialism can't threaten us, he will come back. Don't you think so?" Comrade Lu Fengying talked about the changes in her mood. She said, "I do miss him, especially when I encounter difficulties, I think of him. When he first left, I felt very empty and somewhat aggrieved during the New Year and other festivals, seeing other families reuniting. Sometimes, I would find a few women and we would sing and play together to cheer myself up. Afterward, I would think that I was not strong enough. I have had such emotions less recently. The Soviet film 'Cavalier of the Gold Star' helped me a lot. I wholeheartedly hope that he will become a combat hero in the army and, when he returns home in the future, he will help us build a good collective farm like Cavalier of the Gold Star Serazhedin."
    As they spoke these words, they were filled with strong, sincere, and innocent emotions. These words were filled with their love for the motherland, for their husbands, and even more so with their love for their ideals—building a happier society in the future. This noble and great love encourages their heroic husbands to fight the enemy even more bravely on the front lines, and it also encourages the people of the motherland to devote themselves more actively to the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and to the large-scale construction effort.

    英雄们的好妻子
    李岳鹏、刘万祥
    在松江省林口县的龙山村里，干部和农民都高兴地和我们讲三位模范军属王素梅、卢凤英和于桂贞的故事。农民于振江说得很生动。有一次，一个大风雪的冬天，于振江在路上碰到了一挂牛车。风刮的呼噜呼噜直响，车子顶着风跑。赶车的戴着大皮帽子，帽子上挂满了白霜，赶车赶得挺熟练，挺带劲。于振江不禁自言自语地赞叹：“这小伙子真能干啊！”谁知到跟前一看，那里是小伙子，原来赶车的就是于桂贞。她赶着车子到离家四十五里地的梨树镇去卖粮食。这样的事情，在她们已经是很习惯了。
    她们不仅自己积极劳动，而且是全村妇女参加农业劳动的带头者和组织者。林口县人民政府的农林科长告诉我们：“她们已成为全村妇女前进的旗帜。”村长李升说：“这三个妇女是村中的大梁。有她们就没有完不成的任务。”
    三个模范军属妇女中间，王素梅是最年轻的一个，也是顶能干的一个。丈夫参军后，她一个人侍弄四垧土地，从来没有让群众代耕过。她曾几次当选为县的劳动模范和军属模范。她培养和团结了卢凤英、于桂贞和村里其他妇女积极分子，发动大家参加生产，使全村妇女都认识了劳动光荣。卢凤英过去虽然自己积极劳动，但在带动别人方面差一点，王素梅就经常去和她谈。谈过去自己受苦的情景，谈现在的幸福生活和光荣地位，谈自己丈夫和战士们英勇作战的事迹。她说：“他们在前方保卫着咱们，要是咱们不好好干，怎对得起他们呢？”经过王素梅的不断教育，卢凤英也积极起来了，一九五一年当选了区的模范宣传员。王素梅和卢凤英、于桂贞经常在一块，商量着怎样带动大家。例如积肥时，有些妇女怕脏，她们就用志愿军在前方吃苦的故事来鼓舞大家。铲地时，有的人怕妇女不会铲地，她们就发动妇女努力学习耕作技术；后来村里人都争抢着请妇女们铲地了。现在，全村不但青年妇女都参加了农业劳动，而且有五个年岁在五十七岁到六十二岁的老大娘也参加了夏锄和秋收。在去年秋季积肥的时候，三十多个妇女和男人一样做积肥工作。这些年轻的姑娘、媳妇们，一个个赤脚卷袖，吆喝着牛车、马车往五尺多高的粪堆上拉。大家这样积极努力的结果，全村积肥达两千七百多车，被评为全县的一等积肥模范村；秋后，这个村又被评为全县的一等丰产模范村。
    王素梅在学习方面也很努力，她从前一字不识，现在已识到一千多个字了。由于她领导群众参加生产获得显著成绩，她在一九五○年被接收入了党，一九五二年当选为青年团支部书记。去年十一月，她被提升为区妇女联合会主任了。
    她们把家庭生活都安排得满好的。拿于桂贞家来说吧，丈夫刚参军的时候，家里的情况还是很困难的。五口人只有一床被，穿的戴的都不齐全，吃菜都不敢多搁油。但是，于桂贞常常以共产党员和革命军人家属的光荣称号来勉励自己，鞭策自己。“幸福生活不是大风刮来的，是靠两只手挣来的呀！”“丈夫参军去了，自己受点累，这是为了国家，为了往后的幸福日子啊。”这样的信念支持着她，使她克服了一切困难。她把全家内内外外的活计统统担负起来。无论在冰天雪地或暑日炎天里，她总是不停地奔忙。种地、铲地、赶集、上店，样样都能做。回到家里，就把家务管得挺好，服侍婆母，拉扯着儿子，使全家都过得安安适适的。辛勤劳动的结果，她的家庭变样了。现在有了车，有了大小五头牛，每人做了几套衣服，三天两头吃一顿细粮。婆母对她也比以前更亲热了。她当选了劳动模范。谈到她的丈夫的时候，她愉快地说：“他在家的时候，我们还过着贫苦日子；如今我和婆母领着孩子过的是幸福的日子，我算对得起他，也没有辜负党和国家对我的培养。”
    她们的模范行为，大大地鼓舞在前方作战的亲人。当我们到卢凤英家拜访的时候，一进屋，最引人注意的就是那张挂在墙上的她和她的英俊的丈夫抱着孩子合照的相片。她指着照片，用骄傲兴奋的心情告诉我们：“他先后给我寄回了两次立功喜报啦！”
    她向我们讲述了去年她和丈夫李成奎一次会见时的谈话。她说：“他问我：‘你入党没有？’我说：‘还没有呢！’他就鼓励我一顿，叫我争取早日入党。他又讲了他入党时的情形。我看他变的多了，变的有学问了，更有感情了。他问我‘你盼我回来不？’我说：‘盼是盼，可不盼你现在回来。国家需要你呀。谁还没个亲人，如果人人都把亲人盼回家了，那国家没人保住，咱们的好日子也保不住啦！’他听我说着老是点头笑。我看他变的更坚强了。临了我向他保证：‘一九五二年准给你个喜讯。’”
    卢凤英的保证实现了。一九五二年十二月，这个先进的青年团员光荣地参加了共产党。她又被选为村妇女联合会主任和新成立的农业生产合作社副主任，领导农民向集体化前进。当时，她兴奋得什么似的，甚至夜里做梦也在给丈夫写信。
    “亲爱的成奎同志：我实现了你的嘱咐，现在是一个光荣的共产党员了。咱村的生产搞得热火朝天，成立了农业生产合作社，我当选了副主任。咱家的生活也比以前更好了。不过这还只是个开头，更幸福的日子还在后头。将来你胜利回来的时候，也许咱村已经变成了集体农庄，我不断地进步，说不定会是集体农庄主席哩。那时候有电灯，有机器种地，再也不使老牛犁地了。”
    卢凤英说，这段信稿是她在梦里想着要写的。后来写信时又加了一段：“自从成立农业生产合作社以后，村里变得更可爱了。门前的小河，春、夏、秋三季饮牲口像自来水一样方便。东南两山间的一百多垧地，今年就连成一片了，将来好用拖拉机种地呀！”她说，她还在信末这么写着：“你回来的时候，我远远地去接你，我希望接回来的人是战斗英雄。”
    当我们访问这几位模范军属的时候，在谈话中，我们笑着问她们：“你们想不想他呀？”“又不是木头疙瘩，谁对自己的爱人还能不想呢？”这是王素梅同志的回答，她接着说：“可是要革命啊。不能为了想他，就不革命。正是想他、爱他，盼他早点胜利回来，我们就工作得更起劲呢！早一天把国家建设得更富强了，帝国主义威胁不了咱们的时候，他就会回来的。你说是不是？”卢凤英同志谈到了自己心情的变化。她说：“想是想，特别是遇到困难的时候，便想起他。在他刚走时，一到了年节，看人家老少团聚，我就觉得很空捞，心里有些屈闷。有时候，找几个妇女，大家到一起唱唱玩玩，心里就畅亮了。过后一寻思，自己还不够坚强。近来就很少有这样的情绪了。前些日子看了苏联影片‘金星英雄’，对我又有很大帮助。我一心盼他在部队里成为战斗英雄，将来回家时，像金星英雄谢拉杰那样，帮我们建设好集体农庄。”
    讲这些话的时候，她们都充满了坚强、真诚和天真的感情。这些话里，充满了她们对祖国、对自己的丈夫的热爱，更充满了对自己的理想——建设未来的更幸福的社会的热爱。这种崇高伟大的爱情鼓舞着她们的英雄丈夫在前线更英勇地杀敌，也鼓舞着祖国人民更积极地投入抗美援朝斗争和大规模的建设事业。
