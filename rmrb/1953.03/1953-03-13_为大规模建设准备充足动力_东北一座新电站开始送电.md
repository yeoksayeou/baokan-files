    Preparing Sufficient Power for Large-Scale Construction
    New Power Plant in Northeast Begins Supplying Electricity
    [From Our Newspaper] A massive power plant in Northeast China—Power Plant 0170—has been completed and began supplying electricity on March 3rd.
    This power plant is quite large in scale, and the electricity it supplies for industrial production can create 584 billion yuan of wealth for the country annually. The equipment for this power plant included 2,000 tons of foreign orders and another 1,000 tons of parts processed by our own repair shops. The foundation work for various machines involved pouring 2,500 cubic meters of concrete. The electricity used to start various machines during installation required a constant 6,000 to 7,000 kilowatts, equivalent to the lighting electricity for a city with 1.5 million people.
    The degree of automation in this massive power plant is also considerable. Although the old factory buildings imposed significant limitations, it is still the most modern of all power plants in the country. The coal, water, wind, and oil used are controlled by special devices and can be automatically adjusted with the increase or decrease of the generator load. This power plant is also a veritable "remote control" factory. The switchboard is more than 100 meters away from the generator, but any minor problem with the generator can be immediately detected on the switchboard and freely controlled. This power plant has new equipment—"emergency lighting" electricity. If the power plant loses power, simply opening a dedicated switch will release electric light to facilitate repair work. Contrary to the general idea that places with boilers are always the dirtiest, with coal ash and smoke often filling the entire workshop, this boiler workshop is not like that. Due to the precision of the equipment, the air in the workshop is as fresh as in a living room.
    The completion of this vast project once again proves the unparalleled depth of Soviet internationalist friendship and assistance. The Soviet Union not only shipped us the latest machinery and equipment but also sent a large number of experts to help us install it. Soviet experts taught us to install machinery using the world's latest technology, helped us to compile detailed construction schedules, gave "technical lectures" to technicians and technical workers, and cultivated reserve forces for us. From the start of construction to the present, Soviet experts have selflessly worked on-site. This is the fundamental reason for the successful completion of the project.
    The completion of this project also illustrates once again that the Chinese working class is fully capable of carrying out such complex and sophisticated mechanical installation projects. Installing a large turbine perfectly level, without even half a hair's breadth of difference, is very difficult, but the workers completely met the quality standards of the original design requirements in just twelve days. Boiler bricklaying is delicate work, requiring the protection of the boiler's heat and air, not allowing any of it to escape. The workers strived to achieve this. When the Gao Shouyuan bricklaying team finished laying the eighteenth boiler, the Soviet experts praised it, saying: "Excellent!" After finishing the nineteenth boiler, the experts said again: "It has reached the Soviet top standard!"
    This project officially began construction on July 13th of last year and was originally scheduled to begin supplying electricity on May 1st of this year. Thanks to the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts and the hard work of the workers, it has been fully completed two months ahead of schedule.

    为大规模建设准备充足动力
    东北一座新电站开始送电
    【本报讯】东北一座巨大的发电站——○一七○发电站已经完工，三月三日开始送电。
    这个发电站规模相当宏大，送电量用之于工业生产，每年可给国家创造五千八百四十亿元的财富。这个发电站的设备，仅国外订货就有两千吨，自己修配厂加工的部件又有一千吨；各种机器的基础工程，浇注了两千五百立方公尺的混凝土；安装时起动各种机械所用的电力，要经常保持六千至七千瓩，相当于一个拥有一百五十万人口的城市照明用电。
    这个巨大发电站的自动化程度也是很可观的。虽然旧有的厂房给了它很大限制，但它仍然是目前全国所有发电厂中最新式的。所用的煤、水、风、油都有特殊装置来控制，并且可以随着发电机负荷的增减而自动调整。这个发电站也是名符其实的“远方操纵”的工厂，配电盘远离发电机有一百多公尺，但发电机有一点点毛病，在配电盘上就能够立刻觉察，并且可以自由控制。这个发电站有着新式的装备——“事故照明”用电，如果发电站停了电，只要把一处专用的电闸打开，就会放出电光，以便于修理工作的进行。按照一般的想法，凡有锅炉的地方总是最脏的，煤灰与烟常常会弥漫整个车间，但这个锅炉车间并不那样，由于设备的精密，车间内的空气和客厅的一样新鲜。
    这个庞大工程的完工，再次证明了苏联国际主义的友谊帮助是无比深厚的。苏联不仅给我们运来最新式的机械设备，而且派来大批专家帮助我们安装。苏联专家教给我们用世界上最新的技术安装机械，还帮助我们具体、详细地编订施工进度计划，给技术人员和技术工人开“技术讲座”，替我们培养后备力量。从施工到现在，苏联专家始终忘我地在现场工作。这是工程得以顺利完工的根本原因。
    这个工程的完工也再一次说明我国工人阶级是有充分能力进行这样复杂而又精巧的机械安装工程的。庞大的透平机要安装得十分平正，不许有半根头发之差，这本是很困难的事情，但是工人们只用了十二天工夫就完全达到了原设计要求的质量标准。锅炉砌砖是很细致的工作，要求保护锅炉里的热量和风，不让它们有一点点跑到外面来。工人们努力做到了这一点，高守元瓦工班砌完第十八号锅炉时，苏联专家看了赞美说：“优良！”砌完第十九号炉后，专家又说：“已经达到了苏联头等标准！”
    这个工程是从去年七月十三日正式施工的，原计划于今年五月一日开始送电，由于苏联专家的热情帮助和工人的辛勤劳动，已经提前两个月全部完成了。
