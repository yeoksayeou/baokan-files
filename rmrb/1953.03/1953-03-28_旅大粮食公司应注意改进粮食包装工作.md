    Lüda Grain Company Should Pay Attention to Improving Grain Packaging

    Zhao Yu Zhi, Liu Qingdong write: The Lüda Grain Company does not pay enough attention to grain packaging, resulting in huge losses to national property. For example, among the large quantities of grain shipped by the company to Northern Jiangsu from January 26th to March 3rd this year, the packaging of the 2 million jin of corn was relatively good, but the packaging of the rest was very poor, and most of the burlap sacks were only sewn with four or five stitches, sewn very loosely. As a result, grain was scattered everywhere during loading and unloading. Although temporary workers were hired to repair them, it was not very effective. It is estimated that 250,000 jin of grain were scattered in the warehouse, and no less than four or five thousand jin were scattered and could not be recovered. Furthermore, the same situation occurred with the grain shipped by the company to the Nantong Special Zone in Jiangsu Province this year. When the company's second batch of grain arrived in the Nantong Special Zone, the receiving personnel of the Nantong Special Zone Grain Bureau, seeing that the packaging of this batch of grain was too bad, raised objections to the company's escorts and asked them to write a letter reflecting this situation to the company's leaders to pay attention to improvement. At that time, the escort Zhang Jisheng also agreed to this approach, but when the third, fourth, and fifth batches of grain arrived, the grain packaging situation had not improved in the slightest. We believe that the leaders of the Lüda Grain Company do not care about grain packaging, resulting in undue losses to national property, which is unacceptable and should be quickly corrected and deeply reviewed.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    旅大粮食公司应注意改进粮食包装工作
    赵御之、刘晴东来信：旅大粮食公司不重视粮食包装工作，致使国家资财遭受巨大损失。如该公司今年一月二十六日至三月三日，先后运往苏北的大批粮食中，除二百万斤玉米包装较好外，其他包装都很差，且大部分麻袋缝口只缝上四、五针，缝得很松，因此粮食起卸时，撒得到处都是，虽经临时雇工修补，仍不大管事。计撒在货仓里的粮食就有二十五万斤，撒掉不能收回的也不下四、五千斤。又该公司今年运往江苏省南通专区的粮食，也发生同样情况。当该公司第二批粮食运到南通专区时，南通专区粮食局接收人员因见这批粮食包装坏得太不像话，曾向该公司押运人员提出意见，并请他们将这一情况写信反映给公司领导同志注意改进，当时押运员张继盛也表示同意这种做法，但在第三、四、五批粮食运来时，粮食包装情况仍未见丝毫改进。我们认为旅大粮食公司领导同志不关心粮食包装工作，致使国家资财遭受不应有的损失，这是不能令人容忍的，应迅速加以改正并作深刻检讨。
