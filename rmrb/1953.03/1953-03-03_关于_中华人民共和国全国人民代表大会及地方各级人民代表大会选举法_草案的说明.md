Explanation on the Draft "Electoral Law of the National People's Congress and Local People’s Congresses"
(Report to the Central People's Government Committee on February 11, 1953)

Chairman, esteemed members, comrades:

The 20th session of the Central People's Government Committee passed the "Resolution on Convening the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses at All Levels" on January 13, 1953, deciding to "convene people's congresses at the township, county, and provincial (municipal) levels this year, elected by the people through universal suffrage, and on this basis, convene the National People's Congress"; and resolved to establish an Electoral Law Drafting Committee to draft the electoral law. After the Electoral Law Drafting Committee was established, it immediately began its work in accordance with the aforementioned resolution. Based on the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the issue of implementing universal suffrage, we studied the actual situation of our country's people's democratic dictatorship over the past three years, absorbed the experience of Soviet elections, and solicited opinions from various parties. After multiple discussions and revisions, we drafted the "Electoral Law of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses of the People's Republic of China." Now the Electoral Law Drafting Committee has designated me to explain this draft and submit it to the Central People's Government Committee for review and approval.

(I)

The overall spirit running through the draft electoral law is to stipulate a truly democratic election system based on the current specific circumstances of our country.

Chairman Mao once pointed out in his book "On New Democracy" in 1940: "China can now adopt a system of the National People's Congress, Provincial People's Congress, County People's Congress, District People's Congress, down to the Township People's Congress, and elect governments at all levels by the people's congresses. However, it must implement a truly universal and equal electoral system without discrimination based on gender, belief, property, or education, in order to be suitable for the status of all revolutionary classes in the country, to express public opinion and guide the revolutionary struggle, and to be suitable for the spirit of New Democracy." We follow this basic principle to stipulate our country's election system.

The universality of our electoral rights is manifested in the following provisions of the draft electoral law: all citizens of the People's Republic of China who have reached the age of eighteen, regardless of nationality or race, gender, occupation, social origin, religious belief, education level, property status, and length of residence, have the right to vote and stand for election. In order to implement this universal election, the draft electoral law makes special provisions for women's right to vote and stand for election; and makes clear and necessary provisions for the elections of people of all nationalities, for the election of the People's Armed Forces and for overseas Chinese. Of course, our universal suffrage system must still restrict the electoral rights of some people. Therefore, the draft also stipulates that those landlord class elements who have not changed their status in accordance with the law, counter-revolutionaries who have been deprived of political rights in accordance with the law, others who have been deprived of political rights in accordance with the law, and mentally ill patients do not have the right to vote or stand for election. However, the proportion of these few who have no right to vote or stand for election is very small compared to the total population. That is to say, the voters in our country will account for a very high proportion of the national population. Our election is a universal election in the true sense of the word. Undoubtedly, the people's congresses at all levels produced on the basis of such universal suffrage have the broadest representation of the people. The draft stipulates that citizens who have reached the age of eighteen have the qualification to be elected as representatives to people's congresses at all levels. This is because, in the current situation in our country, it is only beneficial and not harmful to elect some young outstanding elements who are full of revolutionary vigor, dare to criticize and self-criticize, and dare to expose bad people and bad deeds to people's congresses at all levels, especially to grassroots political power. As for the restrictions on the electoral rights of some people, such as the restrictions on the electoral rights of landlord class elements who have not changed their status. Needless to say, this is only a temporary measure, which is unavoidable under today's historical conditions, and in the near future, when conditions change, this type of restriction currently implemented will become unnecessary.

The equality of our electoral rights is manifested in the following provisions of the draft electoral law: all male and female voters participate in the election on an equal basis, and each voter has only one vote. That is to say, for all citizens who have reached the age of eighteen, their electoral rights are unrestricted and their equal democratic rights are fully guaranteed. The draft electoral law also stipulates that the number of representatives to the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels and the election of representatives are based on a certain proportion of the population. At the same time, the draft appropriately takes care of regions and units, so different proportions are stipulated between urban and rural areas, and between the Han nationality and minority nationalities. These different proportional provisions in the election are not completely equal in some respects, but only in this way can the real life of our country be truly reflected, and can all nationalities and all classes in the country have representatives in the people's congresses at all levels that are commensurate with their status. Therefore, it is not only very reasonable, but also completely necessary for us to transition to a more equal and completely equal election.

The draft electoral law stipulates that all election expenses are paid by the state treasury. This is a major measure to guarantee in material terms that voters and candidates can actually enjoy the right to free election.

The draft electoral law stipulates that voters can freely choose those whom they consider satisfactory and necessary when nominating candidates and electing representatives, and have the right to recall and re-elect elected representatives in accordance with legal procedures. The draft also specifically stipulates the appeal procedures for voter registration issues and the severe sanctions against all acts that undermine the election. All of these are full guarantees for voters to freely exercise their electoral rights.

The draft electoral law stipulates that we only implement direct elections in grassroots political power units such as townships, towns, municipal districts, and cities without districts, and implement indirect elections above the county level. We only adopt the method of secret ballot above the county level, while in grassroots political power units, we generally adopt the method of voting by show of hands. That is to say, our election is not completely direct, and the voting method is not completely secret. This is determined by the actual conditions of our country's current social situation, the lack of electoral experience among the people, and the large number of illiterates. If we ignore these actual conditions and force ourselves to stipulate some election methods that seem very complete in form but are actually unworkable, the result will be nothing but increasing the difficulty of the election and practically restricting the electoral rights of many citizens.

It must be pointed out that the essence of our electoral law lies in practical democracy. In view of the different conditions in various parts of the country, and the fact that we are conducting such a nationwide election for the first time, and both the leadership and the masses lack experience, some clauses only make general provisions. Some specific issues related to the election are left to the provincial and municipal people's governments to formulate detailed implementation rules to suit various specific circumstances. Needless to say, this is a practical and workable method that can fully guarantee the democratic rights of the people under the current conditions.

Indeed, our election system is not as complete as the current election system in the Soviet Union. As everyone knows, the election system of the Soviet Union in various periods has always been the most democratic election system in the world, especially after the promulgation of the Stalin Constitution in 1936, the Soviet Union perfectly implemented a universal, equal, direct and secret ballot election system. This is the best election system in the world. With the development of our country's politics, economy and culture, we will definitely adopt a more complete election system like that of the Soviet Union in the future.

However, the election system we have now stipulated cannot be compared with the election system of any bourgeois country. Speaking of elections, we have held them in China during the period of the Northern Warlords and Chiang Kai-shek. Whether it was the elections held by the Northern Warlords or Chiang Kai-shek, they were stinking from the essence to the form. We are all familiar with this and there is no need to say more about it. However, there are indeed some people in our country who were fascinated by the elections of the European and American bourgeoisie. Most of them have now realized the fraud of the European and American bourgeois false democracy, but perhaps a few people have not yet seen through the fraud. What is the truth? Take the United States as an example. According to official U.S. statistics, there are more than fifty restrictions on eligibility to vote in the United States (such as restrictions on property status, length of residence, education level, height, age, religious belief, "social reputation," etc.). The "election tax" and "poll tax" in the United States often deprive the vast poor working people and the vast black people of their right to vote. According to the materials in 1942, only 10% of blacks over the age of 21 in the United States were included in the voter registration list, and only 1% participated in voting. Due to various restrictions, 20 million qualified voters in the United States were unreasonably deprived of their right to vote in the 1948 election, and in last year's election, this number of people deprived of their right to vote, according to the Associated Press, increased to 25 million, accounting for a quarter of the number of people who reached the voting age. This is only in terms of the right to vote. As for the right to be elected, it is completely monopolized by a very small number of billionaires in the United States. The United States is like this, and other bourgeois countries are essentially the same. In many bourgeois countries, women and soldiers are completely or partially excluded from elections, and many countries have unreasonably stipulated restrictions on nationalities and races, and in some countries, members of the upper house still adopt appointment and hereditary systems. Candidates in bourgeois countries usually have to pay a large amount of taxes and bear election expenses. This puts poor people and rich people in a completely unequal position in terms of candidate nomination. In addition to this, the bourgeoisie uses money to take bribes, carry out political deals and other various malpractices to achieve its goal of monopolizing elections. It can be seen from this that the bourgeois election system can only be based on protecting the bourgeois exploitation system and the national oppression system. It will never allow the people to have any right to be masters of their own affairs. It stipulates some hypocritical and seemingly beautiful things in form, which are purely for the purpose of deceiving the people and protecting its privileged rule.

Bourgeois countries will not have true democracy, nor dare to give the people true democracy. As Lenin said: "Bourgeois democracy... has always been—and cannot but be under capitalism—narrow, truncated, hypocritical, and sanctimonious democracy, a paradise for the rich, and a trap and fraud for the poor and exploited."

But, as everyone knows, even this hypocritical and sanctimonious bourgeois democracy is now being abandoned step by step by the bourgeoisie in the current bourgeois countries, especially in the United States and in countries controlled by U.S. imperialism. There, as Comrade Stalin said, "Now, there is not even a shadow of liberalism."

Completely opposite to bourgeois countries, we are a country where the people are the masters of their own affairs. Our state power belongs to the people, and all the people have the right to elect their own representatives to manage state affairs, and the people themselves have the right and various opportunities to constantly supervise the work of state organs. Therefore, the more fully we promote democracy, the more consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship will be, the closer the relationship between the people's government and the people will be, and the more able we will be to complete every specific task of the country on the basis of fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the people. This is the fundamental reason why our election system has full democracy, and this is the fundamental reason why our election system is thousands of times superior to the bourgeois election system.

(II)

The Common Program stipulates: "The state power of the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise state power are the people's congresses at all levels and the people's governments at all levels." The Organizational Law of the Central People's Government also stipulates: "The government of the People's Republic of China is a government of the people's congress system based on the principle of democratic centralism." According to these provisions, we must produce people's congresses at all levels through which the people exercise their power on the basis of universal suffrage. Chapters 2 and 3 of the draft electoral law make appropriate provisions for the number of representatives to people's congresses at all levels.

We formulated the number of representatives to people's congresses at all levels based on the following two principles: (1) It must make the people's congresses at all levels state power organs with working ability, which are convenient for convening meetings and for discussing and solving problems; (2) It must make the people's congresses at all levels have close ties with the people. In the people's congresses, there must be representatives equivalent to the status of all democratic classes in society and representatives equivalent to the status of all nationalities or races, and attention must also be paid to the regional nature of the representatives, so as to promptly reflect the situations of all nationalities, classes, and regions, and to promptly transmit the resolutions of the people's congresses to the people of all nationalities, classes, and regions, and turn each resolution into the actual action of the entire people.

Based on these principles, we believe that the number of representatives in basic-level political power units such as townships, towns, and municipal districts should not be too many. Because basic-level units have short meeting intervals and many specific issues, it is difficult to discuss and solve problems thoroughly if there are too many representatives, and it will consume too much manpower and time. Therefore, the draft stipulates that the number of representatives in townships and towns is generally 15 to 35, and the number of representatives in municipal districts is 35 to 200, which is appropriate. After this is implemented, in townships, towns, and municipal districts with a large population, the number of people represented by each representative may be large, and it may not be convenient to contact them, which can be solved by appropriate methods.

Generally speaking, the number of representatives to the county people's congress should not be too many. Because county-level political power also deals with relatively specific issues, the number of meetings each year should not be too few, and temporary meetings are sometimes convened. Of course, it is inconvenient if there are too many representatives. The draft generally stipulates that the number of representatives to the county people's congress is 100 to 350, and can reach 450 in special cases. This is because some counties have too many townships under their jurisdiction, and each township must have representatives.

The number of representatives to the provincial and municipal people's congresses is relatively large in the draft. Because provinces and cities have a wide scope of jurisdiction and involve major issues, there must be an appropriate number of representatives to accommodate representatives from all aspects and regions, and it is convenient to handle relatively complex issues. Provinces have fewer meetings, and cities can easily convene meetings, so although the number of people is large, it does not matter much. The draft stipulates that the number of provincial representatives is generally 100 to 500, and can be as many as 600 in special cases, and the number of municipal representatives should not be less than 50 and not more than 800, which is appropriate.

According to the calculations in Chapter 3 of the draft, the number of representatives to the National People's Congress is about 1,200. This number is slightly less than the total number of representatives of the two houses of the Soviet Union, but much larger than the parliaments of any other country. This is appropriate for a country like ours under the present conditions.

It must be pointed out that the number of representatives to local people's congresses at all levels stipulated in the draft is smaller than the number of representatives to the current people's representative conferences at all levels in most places, and even much smaller. This is because a larger number of representatives has its advantages in terms of carrying out propaganda and mobilization and training cadres, but it is not very convenient in exercising the functions and powers of the people's congress.

It should also be pointed out that the number of representatives at the provincial and county levels is stipulated more flexibly in the articles, such as the province with a population of less than 20 million is set to have 100 to 400 representatives, which is one example. This is because the population of each province and county is different, the number of units under their jurisdiction is different, the distribution of nationalities is different, and the proportion of urban and rural areas is different, so the provisions of the electoral law for the number of representatives must take into account various regions and should have appropriate flexibility.

In line with the above provisions, the draft stipulates the proportion of the number of representatives to people's congresses at all levels.

The draft stipulates that the number of representatives to be elected in each place is based on population, while taking into account the region. The election of representatives to the people's congresses of townships, towns, and municipal districts is completely determined on the basis of population, that is, in the people's congress of a township, a town, or a municipal district, the number of people represented by each representative is equal. The county and provincial levels must take into account that each township or each county under their jurisdiction has representatives, and are restricted by the number of representatives to the people's congress, so the draft stipulates that the largest township should elect no more than three representatives to the county people's congress, and the largest county should elect no more than three to five representatives to the provincial people's congress. The election of representatives to the National People's Congress is also in accordance with the provisions based on population while taking into account the region and unit. In this way, provinces and cities with large populations should have more representatives than provinces and cities with small populations, which is of course. At the same time, the draft also pays attention to taking care of extremely small provinces, stipulating that each province should have no less than three representatives. In fact, small provinces are mostly in the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest. Small provinces in the Northeast have the number of representatives from industrial cities adjusted, and small provinces in the Northwest and Southwest have the number of representatives from minority nationalities adjusted. Therefore, the number of representatives from these small provinces is generally not small. For example, the number of representatives from Xinjiang and Gansu is equivalent to that of Shaanxi, and Ningxia, with a population of only more than 900,000, can also elect five representatives. This should be considered reasonable.

The draft stipulates different population ratios for urban and rural areas to elect representatives. The article stipulates that each 800,000 people in the province elect one representative to the National People's Congress, while industrial cities can elect one representative to the National People's Congress for every 100,000 people. The same nature of regulations has been made for representatives to the provincial, municipal, and county people's congresses. The city is the center of politics, economy, and culture, where the working class is located, and where industry is located. This stipulation of different population ratios for urban and rural areas to elect representatives reflects the leading role of the working class in the country, and at the same time marks the direction of our country's industrialization. Therefore, this regulation is fully in line with our country's political system and actual situation, and is completely necessary and completely correct.

The draft stipulates appropriate number of representatives for minority nationalities and the People's Armed Forces in people's congresses at all levels. At the same time, it stipulates that the number of representatives to the National People's Congress to be elected by overseas Chinese with a population of about 11 million is 30, which reflects the motherland's concern for overseas compatriots. In addition, it must be emphasized that although there is no need to specifically stipulate the number of women representatives in the draft, attention must be paid to electing an appropriate number of women representatives in the election of representatives to people's congresses at all levels. It is inconceivable that a people's congress without an appropriate number of women representatives would have broad representation.

As mentioned above, the people's congresses at all levels produced in accordance with the provisions of the electoral law will truly reflect the real life and class relations of our country, so that all nationalities and all classes in society have representatives in the people's congresses at all levels that are commensurate with their status, so that our people's congress can have the broadest people's representation, so that it can fully reflect and concentrate the demands of the people of all nationalities, and effectively safeguard the interests of the entire people under the leadership of the working class.

(III)

The draft electoral law makes special provisions for the election of various domestic minority nationalities in a special chapter.

Our country is a large country with many nationalities. People of all nationalities have made more or less contributions to the founding of the motherland. For more than three years, due to the implementation of the national policies stipulated by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, the long-standing national oppression and national discrimination in old China have been fundamentally changed, and true national equality has been realized or is being realized, making the People's Republic of China a big family of friendly cooperation among the people of all nationalities in our country. Undoubtedly, our electoral law should reflect this relationship of national friendship and unity, and consolidate it.

The population of all minority nationalities in the country accounts for about one-fourteenth of the total population of the country. The draft stipulates that the number of representatives of minority nationalities to the National People's Congress is 150, and stipulates that in addition to this fixed number, if there are still minority nationality voters elected as representatives to the National People's Congress, they will not be counted within the number of 150. Therefore, the number of representatives of minority nationalities to the National People's Congress is expected to actually approach one-seventh of the total number of representatives. We believe that the stipulation of this number is reasonable, because there are many national units in the country and they are widely distributed, so it is necessary to make such necessary arrangements so that a considerable number of representatives of domestic minority nationalities can attend the National People's Congress.

For the same reason, the number of representatives of minority nationalities to local people's congresses at all levels should also be determined in accordance with the above spirit.

Therefore, the draft stipulates: "In local people's congresses at all levels, where there are minority nationality settlements within the territory, each settled minority nationality shall have representatives present."

Therefore, the draft stipulates: "Where the total population of the same minority nationality settled within the territory is less than 10% of the total population of the territory... the number of people represented by each representative may be appropriately less than the number of people represented by each representative of the local people's congress, with a minimum of not less than one-half in principle." For example, in a county with a population of 100,000, it is stipulated that 1,000 people elect one representative, and if the population of a certain settled minority nationality is less than 10,000, it can elect one representative for less than 1,000 people, but the minimum should not be less than 500 people to elect one representative.

However, this regulation is not appropriate for places with a large minority nationality population. Taking Guangxi as an example, the province has a population of nearly 20 million, of which minority nationalities exceed 8 million. If the above regulations are cited, the Han people can elect one representative for every 100,000 people, and can elect 120 representatives. Minority nationalities can elect one representative for every 50,000 people, and can elect 160 representatives, which is of course unreasonable. Therefore, the draft also stipulates: "Where the total population of the same minority nationality settled within the territory accounts for more than 10% of the total population of the territory... the number of people represented by each representative shall be equivalent to the number of people represented by each representative of the local people's congress."

In view of the different population sizes of minority nationalities across the country, the wide distribution of regions, and the differences between concentrated and scattered settlements, the election of minority nationality representatives to people's congresses at all levels requires the adoption of a method of unified calculation of population and unified distribution of the number of representatives to be elected, according to the minority nationality situation in the area under its jurisdiction, so as not to cause problems with improper handling.

The draft fully estimates various different situations, so it only makes general and generalized provisions for the elections of various nationalities. The specific methods of election and the distribution of the number of representatives shall be determined by the people's governments and their election committees at all levels according to the specific situation.

Undoubtedly, the various provisions of the electoral law for the election of minority nationalities will be warmly supported by the people of all minority nationalities, will greatly consolidate the achievements of national unity over the past three years, and will enable all nationalities in the country to achieve further development in the political, economic, and cultural fields under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao.

(IV)

Chapters 6, 7, 8, and 9 of the draft electoral law make specific provisions for election procedures and election methods, which fully guarantee the rights of voters in the election.

The draft electoral law stipulates that after handling voter registration and announcing the voter list, those who have different opinions on the announced voter list may file an appeal with the election committee, and the election committee shall make a decision on the handling within five days. If the appellant is not satisfied with the handling opinion, he may file a lawsuit with the people's court. In this way, the grassroots people's government and the grassroots election committee must act cautiously when handling voter registration. The draft also stipulates that the voter list should be announced 30 days before the election, so that the appellant has ample opportunity to file appeals and lawsuits, and the election committee and the people's court have more time to properly handle appeals and lawsuits regarding voter qualifications.

The draft electoral law stipulates that the Communist Party of China, various democratic parties, various people's organizations, and voters or representatives who do not belong to the above-mentioned parties and organizations may jointly or separately nominate candidate lists according to the election area or election unit. Of course, in practice, it should and may be the main way to nominate candidate lists for people's congresses at all levels in a joint nomination by the Communist Party of China, various democratic parties, and various people's organizations. However, it also stipulates that voters or representatives have the right to nominate candidates separately, so that voters or representatives can have more opportunities to express their opinions, which is beneficial and harmless in our current situation. According to past experience in conducting elections, after the candidate list is proposed, it must be announced in advance so that it can be fully discussed in the voter groups at the grassroots election area and in the representative groups at all levels of the people's congress. Through such democratic discussions, voters can understand the situation of the candidates and identify whether each candidate is nominated appropriately, so as to correct the candidate list according to these opinions, and then formally conduct the election. The draft also stipulates that during the election, voters can vote according to the candidate list, or they can elect other voters they wish to elect. Through such procedures, the opinions of the voters can be fully expressed, and the election can achieve satisfactory results.

The draft stipulates that elections in grassroots units such as townships, towns, municipal districts, and cities without districts may be divided into several constituencies according to the residence of voters, and election conferences shall be held separately to conduct elections, so that the election location and the residence of voters are not far apart, which facilitates all voters to participate in the election.

The draft also stipulates the necessary clauses to prevent illegal malpractices in the election. The draft stipulates that anyone who uses illegal means such as violence, threats, fraud, and bribery to undermine the election or obstruct voters from freely exercising their right to vote and stand for election, especially those who commit illegal acts such as forging election documents, fabricating ballots, concealing confusion, or retaliating against complainants by personnel of the people's government or the election committee, shall be given criminal punishment by the people's court or the people's tribunal. In order to prevent and timely handle illegal acts that may occur in the election, it is necessary to strengthen the work of the people's courts and people's tribunals. The people's court should form and send out the necessary number of people's tribunals to carry out work with the grassroots units conducting elections, so as to ensure the smooth progress of the election work.

The above provisions show that our election system fully represents the interests of the people. The advantage of our election system lies not only in its stipulation of fully democratic principles, but also in its stipulation of practical and effective specific measures in all aspects of election work, so that the implementation of these principles has definite guarantees.

(V)

The election work of the people's congresses of townships, towns, municipal districts, and cities without districts is the basis of the election work of the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels. If the elections of these grassroots units are well organized, the election work above the county and city levels will be easier.

In this grassroots election movement, on the basis of fully developing democracy, we must enable the cadres of all political power, party, and mass organizations at the grassroots level to receive a profound education under the appraisal of the masses, so as to overcome the commandism and many illegal and undisciplined phenomena that seriously exist in the grassroots organizations and grassroots cadres. Through full democratic elections, we must remove bad elements, lawless and undisciplined elements, and elements who have committed serious commandism errors and are extremely dissatisfied by the people from the posts of various grassroots organizations, and elect people who are loved by the masses and are in contact with the masses to the posts of these organizations. Through this election movement, we must make the connection between the people's government and the people closer, and achieve the purpose of improving the work style of cadres. In addition, because the election of people's congresses at all levels is calculated on the basis of population, we must conduct a nationwide population survey at the same time as voter registration.

The most onerous work at the grassroots level is voter registration. Because the number of voters is very large and a population survey is required, a large amount of manpower is required to do this well. The biggest problem in voter registration is the determination of voter qualifications. In this regard, whether in urban or rural areas, a batch of problems that remain to be solved in a series of democratic reform movements must be solved this time. For example, for landlord class elements, it is necessary to determine those who have undergone more than five years of labor reform and completely obey government laws and have no reactionary behavior should change their status in accordance with the law and give them political rights, and those who do not meet the above conditions should not change their status. For the young children of the landlord class, it is necessary to determine those who have not participated in direct exploitation and completely obey government laws should be given political rights, and those who do not meet the above conditions should not be given political rights. For rich peasant elements, there is generally no question of whether or not they have political rights, that is to say, they have political rights, but in the old liberated areas, the question of whether or not old rich peasant elements have political rights needs to be identified and determined in accordance with the decision of the Government Administration Council on August 4, 1950. For counter-revolutionary elements under surveillance, it is also necessary to conduct a strict identification and cleaning, distinguishing those who need to continue to be under surveillance, those whose reform is better and can shorten the surveillance period or cancel the surveillance but are not given political rights, those whose reform is better and can cancel the surveillance and give political rights, and those whose surveillance is wrong and should restore their political rights. At the same time, if escapees of the counter-revolutionaries are found during voter registration, they must be placed under surveillance and deprived of their political rights. In short, voter registration is an extremely serious task. We cannot allow a reactionary element or a landlord class element who has not changed his status to illegally steal solemn political rights, nor can we allow a citizen to be wrongly deprived of solemn political rights.

The election work at the grassroots level, whether it is voter registration and population survey, whether it is the handling of appeals on voter qualification issues, whether it is the nomination and discussion of candidate lists, whether it is the division of election areas and the convening of election conferences, are all very meticulous and solemn matters. Throughout the entire election process, it is necessary to wage a resolute struggle against commandists, lawless and undisciplined elements, and those who undermine the election in order to ensure the full development of democracy and attract the active participation of the vast number of voters in the election. To this end, the election at the grassroots level must be carried out under the guidance of the working groups sent by the higher-level election committee, and the chairman of the grassroots election committee must be appointed by the higher-level election committee with capable cadres who are not from the local area. Only by sending a large number of specially trained cadres to the grassroots units to participate in and guide the election work can we ensure the accurate implementation of the electoral law in the grassroots units.

(VI)

In order to supervise and guide the accurate implementation of the electoral law, after the electoral law is passed and promulgated, election committees at the central and local levels should be established quickly, necessary offices should be established, and under the leadership of the people's government at the same level and under the guidance of the higher-level election committee, be responsible for handling election matters.

The draft electoral law makes clear and detailed provisions for the organization and tasks of the central and local election committees at all levels. In order to facilitate work, the number of members of the election committees at all levels should not be too many. Even so, the total number of members of the election committees at all levels across the country still reaches about 2 million. At the same time, we are conducting elections for the first time, and the tasks are heavy and the experience is insufficient. If the election committee is not strong, it will not be able to cope with the task. Therefore, it is the key to selecting a group of people who are upright, fair, and in contact with the masses to work in the election committee to do a good job in the election.

Regarding the question of whether members of the election committees at all levels can be nominated as candidates for representatives, that is, the question of whether they should be recused, we believe that there is no need to make a recusal provision, because what we are currently implementing is mainly indirect elections. The election work at the people's congresses at all levels is not presided over by the election committee but by the presidium of the conference, and the grassroots election work is carried out under the supervision and guidance of the working groups sent by the higher-level election committee.

After the establishment of the election committees at all levels, they should formulate their own working procedures, cooperate with relevant departments under the leadership of the local people's government, immediately begin to conduct propaganda on the electoral law, study specific methods for implementing the electoral law in the region, and formulate plans to report to the higher level for approval. However, it should be pointed out that the focus of the work of the election committees at all levels above the county and city levels must be placed on guiding the elections of grassroots units, first of all on the work of selecting and training working teams. As long as we have working teams that are trained, understand the policies, and are proficient in the electoral law, and adopt the working methods of typical experiments, gradual promotion, and phased completion, we can do a good job in grassroots election work in a few months. As long as the grassroots election work is well organized, it will lay the foundation for the successful completion of the election work of people's congresses at all levels above the county level.

The above is an explanation of the draft electoral law.

The passage and promulgation of the Electoral Law of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses of the People's Republic of China is an event of great historical significance in our country's political life. If the first five-year construction plan that our country is beginning marks a new stage in the economic and cultural development of our country, then the promulgation of the electoral law marks a new stage in the development of our people's democratic politics.

Comrade Stalin pointed out in March 1936: "Our new election system makes the work of all organs and groups tense, forcing them to improve their work. The Soviet universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot election system will become a whip in the hands of the people, used to whip the government organs that do not work

    关于“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法”草案的说明
    （一九五三年二月十一日在中央人民政府委员会上的报告）邓小平主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    一九五三年一月十三日中央人民政府委员会第二十次会议通过了“关于召开全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会的决议”，定于今年“召开由人民用普选方法产生的乡、县、省（市）各级人民代表大会，并在此基础上接着召开全国人民代表大会”；同时决议成立选举法起草委员会，进行选举法的起草事宜。选举法起草委员会成立后，遵照上述决议立即开始工作。我们根据人民政协共同纲领有关实行普选问题的规定，研究三年多来我国人民民主专政的实际情况，吸收苏联选举的经验，并征求各方面的意见，经过了多次的讨论和修改，拟定了“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法”草案。现在选举法起草委员会指定我把这个草案加以说明，提请中央人民政府委员会予以审查和批准。
    （一）
    在选举法草案中，贯穿着一个总的精神，就是根据我国当前的具体情况，规定一个真正民主的选举制度。
    毛主席在一九四○年所著“新民主主义论”一书中曾经指出：“中国现在可以采取全国人民代表大会、省人民代表大会、县人民代表大会、区人民代表大会直到乡人民代表大会的系统，并由各级代表大会选举政府。但必须实行无男女、信仰、财产、教育等差别的真正普遍平等的选举制，才能适合于各革命阶级在国家中的地位，适合于表现民意和指挥革命斗争，适合于新民主主义的精神。”我们就是遵循这样的基本原则来规定我们国家的选举制度的。
    我们选举权的普遍性，表现在选举法草案中以下的规定，即：凡年满十八周岁之中华人民共和国公民，不分民族和种族、性别、职业、社会出身、宗教信仰、教育程度、财产状况和居住期限，均有选举权和被选举权。为着实行这种普遍性的选举，选举法草案对于妇女的选举权和被选举权，作了专款的规定；对于各民族人民的选举，对于人民武装部队和国外华侨的选举，都作了明确的必要的规定。当然，我们的普遍选举制对于一部分人的选举权利还是必须加以限制的，所以草案同时规定了那些依法尚未改变成份的地主阶级分子、依法被剥夺政治权利的反革命分子、其他依法被剥夺政治权利者和精神病患者，没有选举权和被选举权。但这几种无选举权和被选举权的分子占人口总数的比例是很小的。这就是说，我们国家的选民，将占全国人口很高的比例。我们的选举是名符其实的普选。无疑的，在这样普选的基础上产生的各级人民代表大会，是具有最广泛的人民代表性的。草案规定凡年满十八周岁的公民就具有被选为各级人民代表大会代表的资格，这是因为在我国目前情况下，把一些富于革命朝气、勇于批评和自我批评、勇于揭发坏人坏事的青年优秀分子选到各级人民代表大会中去，特别是到基层政权中去，是只有好处没有坏处的。至于所规定的对于一部分人的选举权利的限制，如对于尚未改变成份的地主阶级分子的选举权利的限制。不消说，这只是一种临时的办法，是今天历史条件所不可避免的，而在不久的将来，当条件变化之后，现在所实行的这一类的限制就成为不必要的了。
    我们选举权的平等性，表现在选举法草案中以下的规定，即：所有男女选民都在平等的基础上参加选举，每一选民只有一个投票权。这就是说，对于所有年满十八周岁的公民来说，他们的选举权利是不受限制的，他们的平等的民主权利是受到充分保障的。选举法草案还规定了全国及地方各级人民代表大会代表的名额及代表的产生，均以一定人口的比例为基础。同时草案又适当地照顾了地区和单位，所以在城市与乡村间，在汉族与少数民族间，都作了不同比例的规定。这些在选举上不同比例的规定，就某种方面来说，是不完全平等的，但是只有这样规定，才能真实地反映我国的现实生活，才能使全国各民族各阶层在各级人民代表大会中有与其地位相当的代表，所以它不但是很合理的，而且是我们过渡到更为平等和完全平等的选举所完全必需的。
    选举法草案规定了所有选举经费，都由国库开支。这是在物质方面保证选举人和候选人能够在实际上享受自由选举权利的重大的措施。
    选举法草案规定了选举人对于代表候选人的提出和代表的选举，完全可以自由地选择自己认为满意的和认为必要的人，并对选出的代表，有权依照法定手续撤回补选。草案还特别规定了有关选民登记问题的申诉程序和对一切破坏选举行为的严厉制裁。所有这些，都是使选民获得自由行使其选举权利的充分保障。
    选举法草案规定了我们只在乡、镇、市辖区及不设区的市等基层政权单位实行直接的选举，而在县以上则实行间接的选举。我们只在县以上采用无记名投票方法，而在基层政权单位，则一般地采用举手表决的投票方法。这就是说，我们的选举还不是完全直接的，投票的方法也还不是完全无记名的。这是由于我国目前的社会情况、人民还有很多缺乏选举经验以及文盲尚多等等实际条件所决定的。如果我们无视这些实际条件，在现在就勉强地去规定一些形式上好像很完备而实际上行不通的选举方法，其结果，除了增加选举的困难和在实际上限制许多公民的选举权利之外，没有任何的好处。
    必须指出，我们选举法的实质，是着眼于实际的民主。鉴于全国各地情况不一，而我们又系初次进行这样全国性的选举，无论领导方面或群众方面都还缺乏经验，所以有些条文，只作了概括性的规定。有关选举的若干具体问题，留待省市人民政府制定选举实施细则时去解决，俾能适合于各种具体的情况。不消说，这乃是在目前条件下能够充分保证人民民主权利的切合实际的行得通的办法。
    诚然，我们的选举制度比起苏联现行的选举制度来说，是不够完备的。大家知道，苏联各个时期的选举制度向来是世界上最民主的选举制度，特别是
    在一九三六年斯大林宪法颁布以后，苏联完善地实行了普遍的、平等的、直接的与不记名的选举制度。这是世界上最好的选举制度。随着我国政治、经济、文化的发展，我们将来也一定要采用像苏联那样的更为完备的选举制度。
    但是，我们现在规定的这个选举制度，是任何资产阶级国家的选举制度所不能够比拟的。谈到选举，我们中国在北洋军阀时代和蒋介石时代都曾办过，无论北洋军阀或蒋介石所办的选举，从实质到形式都是臭气薰天的，我们大家对此都很熟悉，可以不必去多说它。不过我们国内确实有一些人对于欧美资产阶级的选举是着过迷的，他们中间的多数人现在已经认识到那种欧美资产阶级假民主的骗局，但是也许有少数人对那种骗局还没有看清楚。事实上怎样呢？拿美国来作例子吧。根据美国官方统计资料，美国有五十多种对于选举资格（例如对于财产状况、居住年限、教育程度、高度年龄、宗教信仰、“社会声望”等等）的限制。美国的“选举税”和“人头税”经常剥夺了广大贫苦的劳动人民和广大黑人的选举权利。根据一九四二年的材料，美国年满二十一岁的黑人仅有百分之十列入选民名册，而参加投票者则仅有百分之一。由于种种的限制，美国在一九四八年大选中有两千万合格的选民被无理地剥夺了选举权利，而在去年那次大选中，这种被剥夺了选举权利的人，据美联社估计，要增至两千五百万人，即占达到选举年龄的人数的四分之一。这还只是就选举权说的，至于被选举权，在美国更完全为极少数的亿万富翁所包办。美国如此，其他资产阶级国家在实质上也是一样。有许多资产阶级国家中的妇女和服兵役者全部地或部分地被摈除于选举之外，好些国家都蛮横无理地规定了民族和种族的限制，有些国家的上议院议员至今还采用着任命制和世袭制。资产阶级国家的候选人通常要缴纳大量税金，负担选举费用。这就使得穷苦的人们和富翁在候选人提名的方面处在完全不平等的地位。除此之外，资产阶级更利用金钱采取贿赂、进行政治买卖及其他各种舞弊的办法，以达到其包办选举的目的。由此可见，资产阶级的选举制度，只能是以保护资产阶级剥削制度和民族压迫制度为基础，它绝不允许人民有什么当家作主的权利，它在形式上规定一些虚伪的看来似乎漂亮的东西，也纯系为着欺骗人民保护其特权统治的目的。
    资产阶级国家不会有真正的民主，也不敢给人民以真正的民主。正如列宁所说：“资产阶级的民主制……始终是——而且在资本主义之下不能不是——狭窄的，残缺的，虚伪的，假仁假义的民主，对于富者为天堂，对于贫人和被剥削者为陷阱为骗局。”
    但是，大家知道，即使是这种虚伪的假仁假义的资产阶级的民主制，在现在资产阶级国家里，特别是在美国和在美帝国主义控制的国家里，也已被资产阶级一步一步地抛弃了。在那里，正像斯大林同志所说的那样，“现在，连一点自由主义的影子也没有了。”
    与资产阶级国家完全相反，我们是人民当家作主的国家，我们的国家政权属于人民，全体人民都有权利选派自己的代表去管理国家的事务，而人民自己则有权利并有各种机会去经常地监督国家机关的工作。所以，我们愈充分发扬民主，人民民主专政就愈加巩固，人民政府与人民之间的联系就愈加密切，就愈能在充分发挥人民积极性的基础上，完成国家每一个具体的任务。这就是我们的选举制度之所以具有充分民主性的根本原因，这就是我们的选举制度之所以千百倍地优越于资产阶级选举制度的根本原因。
    （二）
    共同纲领规定：“中华人民共和国的国家政权属于人民。人民行使国家政权的机关为各级人民代表大会和各级人民政府。”中央人民政府组织法又规定：“中华人民共和国政府是基于民主集中原则的人民代表大会制的政府。”根据这些规定，我们就要在普选的基础上，产生人民行使政权的各级人民代表大会。选举法草案第二第三两章，就是对于各级人民代表大会的代表名额，作出适当的规定。
    对于各级人民代表大会代表的名额，我们是依据这样两个原则来拟定的，即：（一）它必须使各级人民代表大会是具有工作能力的国家政权机关，既便于召集会议，又便于讨论问题和解决问题；（二）它必须使各级人民代表大会与人民之间具有密切的联系，在人民代表大会中，既须有相当于社会各民主阶级地位和有相当于各民族或种族地位的代表，又须注意到代表的地区性，以便于随时反映各民族各阶级各地区的情况，并能随时将代表大会的决议迅速传达到各民族各阶级各地区的人民中去，把每个决议都变成为全体人民的实际行动。
    根据这样的原则，我们认为乡、镇、市辖区等基层政权单位的代表名额不宜过多。因为基层单位的会议间隔短，具体问题多，如果代表人数过多，很难周密地讨论问题和解决问题，而且要耗费过多的人力和时间。所以，草案规定乡、镇代表名额一般为十五人至三十五人，市辖区代表为三十五人至二百人，是适当的。这样实行之后，在人口较多的乡、镇、市辖区，每一代表所代表的人口数可能较多，联系起来较不方便，这可采取适当方法加以解决。
    县人民代表大会的代表名额，一般地说，也不宜太多。因为县级政权接触的问题也比较具体，每年开会次数不宜过少，有时还要召集临时会议，当然代表人数过多是不便利的。草案一般规定县人民代表大会代表名额为一百人至三百五十人，特殊者还可达到四百五十人，这是因为有些县份所辖乡数过多，而每乡又必须有代表的原故。
    省、市人民代表大会的代表名额，在草案中规定得比较多。因为省、市管辖范围较广，涉及问题较大，必须有适当的名额才能容纳各方面各地区的代表，才便于处理比较复杂的问题。省开会次数较少，市容易召集会议，所以人数虽然较多，但并没有大碍。草案规定省代表名额一般为一百人至五百人，特殊者可以多到六百人，市代表名额不得少于五十人，不得多于八百人，这是适当的。
    根据草案第三章计算，全国人民代表大会名额，约为一千二百人左右。这个数目略少于苏联两院代表的总和，但比其他任何国家的国会都大得多。这对于我们这样的国家，在现时条件下，是适当的。
    必须指出，草案中规定的地方各级人民代表大会的代表名额，在多数地方都比现在的各界人民代表会议的代表名额要少，甚至要少得多。这是因为代表名额较多，在进行宣传动员和训练干部这些方面固有好处，但在行使人民代表大会职权上，却不甚便利。
    还须指出，省、县两级的代表名额，在条文上规定得比较活动，如两千万人口以下的省，代表名额定为一百人至四百人，即其一例。这是因为各个省、县人口多少不同，管辖单位多少不同，民族分布情况不同，城乡比重不同，所以选举法对于代表名额的规定，必须照顾到各种地区而应有适当的伸缩性。
    与上述各项规定相适应，草案规定了各级人民代表大会代表名额产生的比例。
    草案规定了各地应选代表的名额，以人口为基础，同时照顾到地区。乡、镇和市辖区人民代表大会代表的选举，是完全以人口为基础来确定的，即在一个乡、一个镇或一个市辖区的人民代表大会里面，其每一代表所代表的人口数是相等的。县、省两级则因必须照顾到所辖每一乡或每一县都有代表而又受到代表大会名额的限制，所以作了最大的乡应选到县人民代表大会的代表不超过三人、最大的县应选到省人民代表大会的代表不超过三人至五人的规定。全国人民代表大会代表的产生，也是按照以人口为基础同时照顾地区和单位的规定，这样，人口多的省、市比人口少的省、市代表名额要多的多，乃是当然的。同时草案中也注意了对于极小省份的照顾，规定每省代表名额不得少于三人。事实上小省多在东北、西北和西南，东北的小省多有工业城市的代表名额调剂，西北和西南的小省多有少数民族的代表名额调剂，所以这些小省的代表名额一般都不算少。例如新疆、甘肃的名额相当于陕西，人口只有九十余万的宁夏也可选出五个代表。这样，应该认为是合理的。
    草案规定了城市和乡村应选代表的不同的人口比例。条文规定省每八十万人选举全国人民代表大会代表一人，而工业城市则每十万人就可选举全国人民代表大会代表一人。对省、市、县人民代表大会代表都作了同样性质的规定。城市是政治、经济、文化的中心，是工人阶级所在，是工业所在，这种城市和乡村应选代表的不同人口比例的规定，正是反映着工人阶级对于国家的领导作用，同时标志着我们国家工业化的发展方向。因此，这样规定是完全符合于我们国家的政治制度和实际情况的，是完全必要的和完全正确的。
    草案规定了少数民族和人民武装部队在各级人民代表大会中的适当的代表名额。同时规定了人口约一千一百万的国外华侨应选全国人民代表大会代表的名额为三十人，这反映了祖国对于国外侨胞的关切。此外，必须着重指出，草案中虽无须专门规定妇女代表的名额，但在各级人民代表大会代表的选举中，必须注意选出适当数目的妇女代表。不能设想，没有适当数目的妇女代表的人民代表大会，会具有广泛的代表性。
    如上所述，按照选举法规定所产生的各级人民代表大会，将真实地反映出我国的现实生活和阶级关系，使社会各民族各阶级都在各级人民代表大会中有与其地位相称的代表，从而使我们的人民代表大会具有最广泛的人民代表性，使它能够充分地反映和集中各族人民的要求，切实地保障在工人阶级领导下的全体人民的利益。
    （三）
    选举法草案对于国内各少数民族的选举，作了专章的规定。
    我国是一个多民族的大国，各民族人民对于祖国的缔造，都有或多或少的贡献。三年多以来，由于贯彻执行了毛主席和中国共产党所规定的民族政策，已经根本改变旧中国长期存在的民族压迫和民族歧视现象，实现了或正在实现着真正的民族平等，使中华人民共和国成为我国各民族人民友好合作的大家庭。无疑地，我们的选举法应该把这种民族友爱团结的关系反映出来，并使之巩固起来。
    全国各少数民族人口数约占全国人口总数的十四分之一。草案规定全国人民代表大会的少数民族代表名额为一百五十人，并规定除了这个固定数目之外，如仍有少数民族选民当选为全国人民代表大会代表者，不计入一百五十人名额之内。所以全国人民代表大会的少数民族代表人数，预计实际上会接近代表总数的七分之一。我们认为这个名额的规定是合理的，因为全国民族单位众多，分布地区很广，需要作这样必需的照顾，才能使国内少数民族有相当数量的代表得以出席全国人民代表大会。
    同样的理由，地方各级人民代表大会的少数民族代表名额，也应根据上述精神去确定。
    所以草案规定：“地方各级人民代表大会，凡境内有少数民族聚居区者，每一聚居的少数民族均应有代表出席。”
    所以草案规定：“凡聚居境内的同一少数民族的总人口数不及境内总人口数百分之十者，其每一代表所代表的人口数，得酌量少于当地人民代表大会每一代表所代表的人口数，最少以不少于二分之一为原则。”比如一个十万人口的县，规定一千人选一个代表，而某一聚居的少数民族的人口在一万以下，则它可以少于一千人选代表一人，但最少不得少于五百人选代表一人。
    但是，这种规定用之于少数民族人口较多的地方，则是不适当的。以广西为例，全省约近两千万人，其中少数民族超过八百万人，如果援引上述规定，则汉族人民每十万人选代表一人，可选代表一百二十人，少数民族每五万人选代表一人，可选代表一百六十人，这当然是不合理的。所以草案又规定：“凡聚居境内的同一少数民族的总人口数占境内总人口数百分之十以上者……其每一代表所代表的人口数，应相当于当地人民代表大会每一代表所代表的人口数。”
    鉴于全国各少数民族的人口多少不一，分布地区很广，又有聚居、散居等等区别，所以各级人民代表大会的少数民族代表的选举，都需要按照所辖地区的少数民族情况，采取统一计算人口和统一分配应选代表名额的办法，才不致于发生处理不当的毛病。
    草案充分地估计到各种不同的情况，所以对于各民族的选举，只作了一般的概括性的规定，有关选举的具体办法和名额的分配，要由各级人民政府及其选举委员会根据具体情况去确定。
    无疑地，选举法对于少数民族选举的各项规定，将获得各少数民族人民的热烈拥护，将大大地巩固三年来民族团结的成果，将使全国各民族在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在政治、经济、文化各方面，都能够获得进一步的发展。
    （四）
    选举法草案第六、第七、第八、第九等章，对于选举程序和选举办法作了具体的规定，这些规定充分地保证了选民在选举中的权利。
    选举法草案规定在办理选民登记并公布选民名单之后，对公布的选民名单有不同意见者，得向选举委员会提出申诉，选举委员会应在五日内作出处理之决定。申诉人如对处理意见不服时，得向人民法庭提出诉讼。这样就可以使基层人民政府和基层选举委员会在办理选民登记时，必须谨慎从事。草案同时规定了选民名单应在选举的三十天以前公布，这样就给了申诉人以进行申诉和诉讼的充分机会，并使选举委员会和人民法庭得有较多的时间，对于选民资格的申诉和诉讼进行妥善的处理。
    选举法草案规定中国共产党、各民主党派、各人民团体和不属于上述各党派、团体的选民或代表均得按选举区域或选举单位联合或单独提出代表候选人名单。当然，在实际上是应该而且可能以由中国共产党、各民主党派和各人民团体联合提名的方式，作为提出各级人民代表大会代表候选人名单的主要方式。但同时规定选民或代表得有单独提出候选人的权利，使选民或代表能有更多表达意见的机会，这在我们现在的情况下是有益无害的。按照以往进行选举的经验，代表候选人名单提出之后，必须先期公布，以便在基层选举区域提到各选民小组、在各级人民代表大会提到各代表小组去进行充分的讨论。经过这样的民主讨论，就能使选举人了解候选人的情况，并鉴别各个候选人是否提得恰当，以便根据这些意见校正候选人名单，而后正式进行选举。草案还规定在选举的时候，选举人可按候选人名单投票，亦可另选自己愿选的其他选民。经过这样程序，可以充分表达选举人的意见，并使选举获得圆满的结果。
    草案规定乡、镇、市辖区和不设区的市等基层单位的选举，得按选民居住情况划分若干选区，分别召开选举大会进行选举，使选举地点和选民住地相距不远，这样就便利了所有选民都能参加选举。
    草案还规定了必要的条款，以制止对于选举的违法舞弊行为。草案规定凡是采用暴力、威胁、欺诈、贿赂等非法手段破坏选举或阻碍选民自由行使其选举权与被选举权的人，特别是犯有伪造选举文件、虚造选票、隐瞒蒙混等违法行为或对控告者采取压制报复行为的人民政府的或选举委员会的人员，都应由人民法院或人民法庭给以刑事惩处。为了防止和及时处理在选举中可能发生的违法行为，必须加强人民法院和人民法庭的工作。人民法院应该组成和派出必需数量的人民法庭，随着进行选举的基层单位开展工作，以保障选举工作的顺利进行。
    以上这些规定，表明了我们的选举制度是充分代表人民利益的。我们选举制度的优点，不但在于它规定了充分的民主的原则，而且还在于它在所有选举工作的各个环节上，都规定了切实有效的具体办法，使这些原则的贯彻有了确切的保障。
    （五）
    乡、镇、市辖区和不设区的市的人民代表大会的选举工作，是全国及地方各级人民代表大会选举工作的基础。办好这些基层单位的选举，县市以上的选举工作就较为容易了。
    在这次基层的选举运动中，我们要在充分发扬民主的基础上，使所有政权的、党的和群众团体的基层组织的干部，都在群众的鉴别下，受到一次深刻的教育，借以克服目前在基层组织和基层干部中严重存在着的命令主义和许多违法乱纪的现象。我们要经过充分民主的选举，把坏分子、违法乱纪的分子和犯有严重的命令主义错误而为人民群众所极不满意的分子从各种基层组织的工作岗位上剔除出去，把群众所爱戴的联系群众的人选到这些组织的工作岗位上来。我们要经过这次选举运动，使人民政府与人民之间的联系更加密切起来，并达到改进干部作风之目的。此外，因为各级人民代表大会的选举是以人口为计算的标准的，所以我们要在选民登记同时，进行一次全国范围的人口调查。
    基层单位最繁重的工作是选民登记。因为选民数量很大，又要进行人口调查，所以需要大量的人力，才能办好这件事情。选民登记中的最大问题，是关于选民资格的确定。在这方面，无论城市或农村，都在一系列的民主改革运动中，遗留了一批尚待解决而在这次必须加以解决的问题。例如对于地主阶级分子，需要确定那些是经过五年以上劳动改造而又完全服从政府法令、没有任何反动行为应依法改变成份并给以政治权利的，那些是尚未具备上述条件不应改变成份的。对于地主阶级的青年子女，需要确定那些是没有参加过直接剥削而又完全服从政府法令应给以政治权利的，那些是没有具备上述条件不应给以政治权利的。对于富农分子，一般并不存在有无政治权利的问题，即是说他们是有政治权利的，但在老解放区，对于旧富农分子有无政治权利的问题，需要按照政务院一九五○年八月四日的决定加以甄别和确定。对于被管制的反革命分子，也需要经过一次严格的甄别和清理，区别出那些是需要继续管制的，那些是改造较好可以缩短管制期限或取消管制但尚不给以政治权利的，那些是改造更好可以取消管制并给以政治权利的，那些是管制错了而应恢复其政治权利的。同时，在选民登记中，如果查出漏网的反革命分子，必须加以管制，并剥夺其政治权利。总之，选民登记是一件极其严肃的工作，我们不能听任一个反动分子或未经改变成份的地主阶级分子非法窃取了庄严的政治权利，我们也不能听任一个公民被错误地剥夺了庄严的政治权利。
    基层的选举工作，无论选民登记和人口调查，无论对于选民资格问题的申诉的处理，无论候选人名单的提出和讨论，无论选举区域的划定和选举大会的召开，都是非常细致和庄严的事情。在整个选举工作过程中，必须同命令主义者、违法乱纪分子和破坏选举的分子进行坚决的斗争，才能保证充分地发扬民主，吸引广大的选民积极地参加选举。为此，基层单位的选举，必须在上级选举委员会派出的工作组的指导之下进行，基层选举委员会的主席，必须由上级选举委员会委派非本地的得力干部充任。只有把大量经过专门训练的干部派到基层单位去参加和指导选举工作，才能保证选举法在基层单位的确切执行。
    （六）
    为了监督和指导选举法的确切执行，在选举法通过和公布之后，即应迅速成立中央及地方各级的选举委员会，建立必要的办公机关，在同级人民政府的领导下和在上级选举委员会的指导下，负责办理选举事宜。
    选举法草案对于中央及地方各级选举委员会的组织和任务，作了明确而详细的规定。为了便于办事，各级选举委员会委员的人数不宜过多，即使这样，计算全国各级选举委员会委员总数仍达两百万左右。同时我们这次又是初办选举，任务繁重，经验不够，如果选举委员会工作能力不强，是无法胜任的。所以挑选一批为人正派、办事公道而又联系群众的人到选举委员会工作，是办好选举的关键。
    对于各级选举委员会委员是否可以被提名为代表候选人的问题，即应否回避的问题，我们认为没有作出回避规定的必要，因为我们现在所实行的主要是间接选举，在各级人民代表大会上的选举工作，不是由选举委员会而是由大会主席团主持的，而基层选举工作又是在上级选举委员会派去的工作组的监督和指导下进行的。
    各级选举委员会成立之后，应该制定自己的工作程序，在当地人民政府领导之下，与有关部门通力合作，立即开始进行选举法的宣传，研究在本地区执行选举法的具体办法，以及制定计划报请上级批准等项工作。但要指出，县、市以上各级选举委员会的工作重点，必须放在指导基层单位的选举上面，首先是放在挑选和训练工作队的工作上面。只要我们有了经过训练的、懂得政策的、通晓选举法令的工作队，而又采取典型试验，逐步推广和分期完成的工作方法，我们是可以在几个月的时间内，办好基层选举工作的。只要基层的选举工作办好，就为县以上的各级人民代表大会选举工作的胜利完成奠定了基础。
    以上是对于选举法草案的说明。
    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法的通过和公布，在我们国家的政治生活中，是一件具有重大历史意义的事件。如果说我们国家正开始的第一个五年建设计划标志着我国经济、文化发展的新阶段，那么，选举法的颁布正标志着我国人民民主政治发展的新阶段。
    斯大林同志一九三六年三月曾指出：“我们新的选举制度，使一切机关与团体的工作紧张起来，逼迫他们来改善自己的工作。苏联普遍的、平等的、直接的与不记名的选举制度，将成为人民手中的鞭子，用去鞭策工作不好的政权机关。”
    无疑地，我们的选举法现在还不及苏联一九三六年以后的选举制度那样完备，但也将产生大体相同的效果。它将大大增强各级人民政府的工作效能；它将使官僚主义者、命令主义者和违法乱纪分子失去藏身之所；它将进一步地加强人民政府与人民之间的联系，并使人民民主专政的国家制度更臻完备；它将更加增强全国各民族之间的团结，并使人民民主统一战线获得进一步的巩固和发展。
    无疑地，我们的选举法将大大发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性，使全国人民更加紧密地团结在毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府的周围，去争取抗美援朝斗争的彻底胜利，实现国家的各项建设计划，并由此引导我们的国家稳步地走向社会主义。
    我们的选举法是中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党领导下，从长期艰难困苦的斗争中获得的一种胜利果实，全国人民将以欢欣鼓舞的心情迎接它的诞生，将以自己的实际行动为它的实现而努力奋斗。
