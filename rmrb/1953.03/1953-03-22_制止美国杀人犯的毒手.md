    Stop the Murderous Hands of American Killers
    Zūn Qí
    Due to the angry protests of the people of the United States and countries around the world, the execution date of the Rosenbergs, two good American citizens sentenced to death on completely fabricated charges of "atomic espionage," has been postponed to March 30. Unless the Court of Appeals makes a decision to postpone the execution again before this date, or the Supreme Court finally decides to retry the defendants, in a few days these two innocent people, who have become "hostages" of the American peace and democracy movement, will be executed in the electric chair.

    From New York to Los Angeles, from Canada to Chile, from Sydney to Trieste, to London, to Stockholm, the angry voices of the broad masses are stopping the murderous hands of the American government.

    The poems and letters written by the Rosenbergs from death row have kept the conscience of mankind from resting. Thousands of trade union organizations have led broad sections of society in various countries to send protest telegrams and letters that are flooding Washington like a tide.

    But it is clear that only larger-scale, truly unprecedented and fierce mass action can save the lives of this couple.

    The just action of the American and other peoples in supporting the Rosenbergs is, of course, to save these two kind and innocent lives, but more importantly, it is a struggle against the American government's implementation of further fascist rule and against its conspiracy to expand aggressive war. The arrest of the Rosenbergs occurred at the same time as the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea (June 1950). After the start of the Korean War, the American ruling group did not find any supportive sentiment among the people. The American people could not understand why they had to go across the ocean to attack Korea. On the contrary, they were against this war. Thus, the war planners urgently needed to create a sensational event to stir up anti-Soviet and anti-communist war mania. They used coerced and bought "witnesses" to falsely accuse Rosenberg of providing the Soviet Union with secret drawings of the American atomic bomb during World War II, and thus said that otherwise, the Soviet Union would not have had the atomic bomb, and would not have "dared to launch the Korean War."

    The rogue judge had induced the Rosenbergs to admit that they were spies of atomic secrets, were communists, and to confess some other progressive elements, and they could obtain forgiveness. But the Rosenbergs were an excellent son and daughter of America, and they considered that doing so "was too great a price to exchange for their lives." They firmly refused to yield. During the trial, the web of malicious lies had been completely exposed. The two most important "witnesses" had confessed that they had deceived the court. The only remaining "evidence" was an empty can for raising donations for Spanish refugees found in the Rosenberg's home. But the United States Supreme Court twice rejected the defendants' appeal. Eisenhower also refused to change the death sentence. They must send this young couple who uphold the truth and love peace to the electric chair to be killed.

    The history of the American bourgeois dictatorship is stained with the blood of the cruel killing of innocent progressive elements, workers, blacks, and Jews. This political machine of financial oligarchs is accustomed to "committing legal crimes under the eyes of the world" (as the famous French writer Romain Rolland wrote on the day the American government executed the falsely accused workers Sacco and Vanzetti, after delaying the case for more than seven years in 1927). Now, the American judicial organs are determined to kill the Rosenbergs without any evidence of guilt. This is for no other reason than to create a precedent, so that all Americans who oppose war, support peace, and uphold democratic rights will be terrified and that all the people will succumb to the dark rule of fascism. On December 15 last year, the 161st anniversary of the passage of the "Bill of Rights," the American government put the original manuscript of the "Bill of Rights" (the first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution) drafted by Jefferson into a vacuum glass box and sealed it in a deep vault. It also wants to use the most shameful murder of the Rosenbergs to eliminate the last bit of residual freedom that the American bourgeoisie once promised to the people.

    This is the most real proof, proving the truth of the words of the great Comrade Stalin: The bourgeoisie has thrown the banner of democratic freedom aside. This large-scale movement to rescue the Rosenbergs, as Comrade Stalin pointed out, shows that the banner of democratic freedom discarded by the bourgeoisie is being held high in the hands of the progressive people. Now, thousands of American trade union organizations, the Australian Seamen's Union, the London Trades Council representing 600,000 workers, and organized workers in Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, and Canada, national workers', youth, and women's groups in China, as well as just legal scholars, scientists, and religious figures in various countries, are pointing the sharp edge of angry condemnation at Eisenhower and the American government executioners, ordering them: "Don't kill the Rosenbergs!"

    制止美国杀人犯的毒手
    尊棋
    由于美国和世界各国人民愤怒的抗议，以完全捏造的“原子间谍”罪名被判处死刑的两个美国善良的公民——罗森堡夫妇的行刑日期，已延缓到三月三十日。除非上诉法庭在这个日子以前作出再度延期执行的决定，或最高法院终于决定重新审判被告，再过几天，这两个已成为美国和平与民主运动的“人质”的无辜者，就要在电椅上被处死了。
    从纽约到洛杉矶、从加拿大到智利、从悉尼到的里亚斯特、到伦敦、到斯德哥尔摩，广大人民怒斥的声音，正在喝止着美国政府杀人犯的毒手。
    罗森堡和他的妻子从死牢里写出的诗和信，使人类的良心不能安静下来。成千的工会组织带动了各国社会广泛阶层发出的抗议电报和信件像潮水一样涌到华盛顿。
    但是很显然，只有更大规模的、真正空前猛烈的群众行动，方有可能挽救这一对夫妇的生命。
    美国和各国人民支援罗森堡夫妇的正义行动，固然是为了拯救这两条善良的、无辜的生命，但更主要的是因为这是一个反对美国政府实行进一步的法西斯统治、反对它扩大侵略战争阴谋的斗争。罗森堡夫妇的被捕是与美国帝国主义者发动侵略朝鲜的战争同时发生的（一九五○年六月）。侵朝战争开始后，美国统治集团没有发现人民中间有任何支持的情绪。美国人民不能理解，为什么他们必须远涉重洋去进攻朝鲜。相反，他们是反对这个战争的。这样，战争的计划者就迫切需要制造一个耸人听闻的事件，借以煽起反苏反共的战争狂热。他们用被胁迫和收买了的“证人”，来诬告罗森堡曾在第二次世界大战期间将美国的原子弹秘密图样供给了苏联，因而说，如果不然，苏联就不会有原子弹，也就不会“胆敢发动朝鲜战争”。
    流氓法官曾诱逼罗森堡夫妇，只要他们承认是原子秘密的间谍，是共产党员，并供出其他一些进步分子，他们就可以获得宽赦。但罗森堡夫妇是美国一对优秀的儿女，他们认为那样做“是拿来和他们的生命交换的过于重大的代价”。他们坚不屈服。就在审判过程中，那些恶毒的谎言的罗网已被全部揭穿。所谓最主要的两个“证人”已供认说，他们欺骗了法庭。最后剩下来的唯一的“证据”是从罗森堡家中搜查出来的一个为西班牙难民募捐的空罐子。但是美国最高法院却两次拒绝了被告的上诉。艾森豪威尔也拒绝改变死刑的判决。他们一定要将这一对坚持真理、爱好和平的青年夫妇送到电椅上去杀害。
    美国资产阶级专政的历史，是沾满了无辜的进步分子、工人、黑人、犹太人的被残酷杀戮的血迹的。这个金融寡头的政权机器惯于“在全世界的眼睛盯视之下进行合法的罪恶”（法国著名作家罗曼罗兰在一九二七年美国政府拖延了七年多的、被诬陷的工人沙可与樊才蒂执行死刑之日这样写道）。现在，美国的司法机关硬要在没有任何罪证之下杀害罗森堡夫妇。这不是为了别的，只为的是造成一个判例，以使所有反对战争、拥护和平、坚持民主权利的美国人民慄慄自危，使全体人民屈服于法西斯的黑暗统治。美国政府在去年十二月十五日“人权法案”通过的一百六十一周年那天，将杰弗逊手订的“人权法案”（美国宪法头十条补充条款）的原稿装入真空的玻璃匣子里封藏到一个深窖中去了。它还要用对罗森堡夫妇的最可耻的谋杀行为来消灭美国资产阶级曾经允诺给人民的有限的自由权利的最后一点残余。
    这是再真实不过的证明了，证明伟大的斯大林同志所说的话的真理：资产阶级已把民主的自由的旗帜抛在一边了。营救罗森堡夫妇的这个大规模的运动，也正如斯大林同志所指出的，说明被资产阶级抛在一边的民主自由的旗帜，正在进步的人民手中高高地举起着。现在，千百个美国工会组织，全澳海员工会，代表六十万工人的伦敦职工委员会，和英国、法国、荷兰、比利时、意大利、加拿大的有组织的工人，中国全国性的工人、青年、妇女团体，以及各国有正义感的法学家、科学家、宗教人士，都在把愤怒谴责的锋芒指向艾森豪威尔和美国政府刽子手们，喝令他们：“不准杀害罗森堡夫妇！”
