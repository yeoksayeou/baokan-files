    Implementing Mao Zedong's Literary and Art Thought in the Teaching of Classical Literature
    Lu Kanru, Vice President of Shandong University
    It has been more than ten years since Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" was published in May 1942. In this classic and brilliant work, Mao Zedong's literary and art thought, as an integral part of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, was brilliantly expounded, the direction and route of the people's literary and art work were clearly pointed out, and the basic problems in the work, namely the combination of literature and art with workers, peasants and soldiers, were profoundly solved. Over the past ten years, under the guidance of Chairman Mao, the general literary and art workers have criticized the "petty-bourgeois kingdom" in the "depths of their souls" and are determined to "go to the masses," determined to temper themselves, transform themselves, and improve themselves in the "fiery struggle." The "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River", "The Hurricane" and "The White-Haired Girl," which have gloriously won the Stalin Prize, are enough to prove that the people's literature and art of the new China are growing healthily and rapidly. At the same time, some writers have emerged from among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, such as Gao Yubao and Chen Dengke. Without this instructive speech, these great achievements would have been unimaginable.
    Of course, we cannot be satisfied with the achievements we have already obtained. We are still a considerable distance away from the tasks Chairman Mao has set for us, and we must continue to struggle for the direction of literature and art put forward by Chairman Mao. However, although there are countless shortcomings in creation and criticism that we urgently need to overcome, the seriousness of these shortcomings is far less than that in the acceptance of literary heritage. Especially in the classical literature teaching work in colleges and universities, not only the bourgeois or petty-bourgeois literary and art thought occupies a leading position, but even feudal or fascist ideas still exist. Some old intellectuals who have not been properly reformed not only spread corrupt ideas to young students when explaining classical works, but also mix toxins from feudal literature in grading writing or teaching other literary courses. If we have not fully implemented Mao Zedong's literary and art thought in creation and criticism, then we have hardly begun to implement it in the teaching of classical literature.
    First of all, we should clearly define the purpose and requirements of classical literature courses. We know that the education we are carrying out now is the education of new democracy. All our courses, whether in literature, science, engineering, agriculture, or medicine, whether in any college, department, subject, or group, although the specific contents of each subject vary greatly, the goal of teaching is only one—to serve our great and beloved motherland, to serve the construction of new democracy, and to serve the hardworking and brave working people, rather than to serve our own personal interests or hobbies. Under the guidance of the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, the State Council and the Ministry of Education have clearly pointed out two points in order to specifically explain the purpose and requirements of each course: First, each course must closely cooperate with the construction tasks of the motherland; second, patriotic ideological education must be implemented in each course. Classical literature cannot be an exception in this regard.
    As Gorky said, "People who start writing must have knowledge of literary history. ...In every undertaking, it is necessary to know the history of the development of this undertaking. If the workers in every production sector, or, to put it more correctly, if the workers in every factory, know how this production sector and this factory came into being, how they gradually developed, and how they completed production, then these workers will have a deeper understanding of the cultural and historical significance of their labor, and they will be more interested and will work better than they do now. ... The fairytale-like success of science and the rapid development of science are precisely because scientists know the history of the development of their specialized disciplines." (Gao Baoquan translated "How I Learned to Write," Sanlian Edition, 1-4 pages.) Therefore, the courses studied by Soviet young writers, "in addition to the necessary courses of Marxism-Leninism and political economy, the most important part of the study time is literary history, ancient literature, folk literature, Soviet literature, literary theory, poetry, novels, children's literature, as well as the history of various national literatures and the history of literature of various democratic countries," and also "to establish special research courses on the history of Chinese literature." (Liu Baiyu, "Visiting the Academy of Literature and Azaev," published in the Literary Gazette, Volume 3, Issue 4, page 31.) We must remember that the present struggle and the past struggle are inextricably linked. Therefore, even when we are creating new things, we are still developing the cause that our ancestors started in the past. We ask young writers to study classical literature in order to ask them to absorb as much as possible the great experience of the people's social struggles for a better future in the past, which is accumulated in excellent literary heritage. We should learn from the spirit of past great writers in exposing masks, and learn from their courage to expose the internal contradictions of social development. We "must not only understand today, but also understand yesterday and the day before yesterday." Without understanding the past, we cannot understand the present.
    Therefore, the responsibility of teachers who teach classical literature is very important. We introduce the masterpieces of the past to young people in order to promote the important and beautiful things created by our ancestors in literature. A correct classical literature researcher cannot but be an enthusiastic patriot, and cannot but be delighted with every work that expresses the great image of the Chinese people in history. For three thousand years, countless excellent writers with people's character have written works that will never be forgotten. In these works, they praised bravery, praised indomitable resistance, and praised sincere and free love. The people of the new China have developed into what they are today. They want to surpass the past and develop to a higher stage. What else can enable us to understand the past world more deeply other than great classical literature? Great writers are born in great nations, and great nations are expressed in great works. The study of classical literature cannot but greatly enhance our patriotic thoughts, if our teachers can teach correctly.
    Marxism-Leninism tells us that there are two kinds of culture in any nation's culture. One is the culture that serves the ruling class, and the other is the culture that serves the oppressed and toiling masses. The same is true of literature. In the words of Fadeyev, part of it is approved by the people, and part of it is not approved. What is approved is the "democratic essence" in the heritage that Chairman Mao said, and what is not approved is the "feudal dross" in the heritage. We should neither overestimate nor underestimate classical literature. It would be a great mistake to regard the "feudal dross" as a treasure. It would not be a small mistake to discard even the "democratic essence." Because Marxism-Leninism does not teach us to completely abandon the most precious achievements of the old society. On the contrary, it teaches us to absorb and transform the valuable things in the historical development of mankind over thousands of years. Chairman Mao has also repeatedly taught us that we should "neither reject everything nor blindly obey" the heritage, but "critically receive it." The creation of the people's literature and art of the new China must directly inherit the excellent tradition of classical literature, and teachers should be responsible for correct criticism.
    Like general literary criticism, the evaluation of classical literature has two criteria: one is the political criterion, and the other is the artistic criterion. According to the political criterion, everything that opposes retrogression and promotes progress is good; everything that opposes progress and pulls people back is bad. According to the artistic criterion, everything with higher artistic quality, that is, "more organized, more concentrated, more typical, more ideal, and therefore more universal," is good, and vice versa. Chairman Mao also said: "No matter what kind of class society or individual classes in any kind of class society, the political criterion is always put in the first place, and the artistic criterion is put in the second place. ... The more reactionary the content of a work is, the more artistic it is, the more it can poison the people, and the more it should be rejected." Literary criticism is not a place to promote one's private tastes, hobbies, and hatreds. We value literature because we clearly see its role in educating and uniting the people, its role in strengthening the people's ideological and political unity; because we are convinced that literature is a tool for understanding and transforming the world, and a powerful weapon for the revolutionary struggle of the masses. If we deny the political significance of literary works, it is not to raise the status of literature, but to belittle its value, because this is tantamount to depriving it of its most important activity, namely its ideological nature. Kalinin said: "A true artist must use his works to promote the development of human thought; a writer who has not set this purpose for himself is only half a writer." (See Poglov, "Kalinin on Literature and Art," published in People's Literature, Volume 2, Issue 2, page 29.) Similarly, we can say that a literary critic who does not make it his purpose to promote the development of human thought is only half a critic. The same is true of classical literature teachers. When we evaluate a classical literary work, the basic questions we seek are: Does it benefit the people? Does it promote the positive qualities of readers? Does it contribute to our progress in thought and moral progress? and so on.
    The political criterion is more important than the artistic criterion, but in great works, profound ideological content inevitably achieves an organic combination with highly artistic forms. For example, Du Fu's poem "The Officer at Shihao" was produced during the An-Shi Rebellion. At that time, the phenomenon of conscription was very common. Du Fu was a great humanist. He loved the people, sympathized with the oppressed and toiling masses, and made accusations on their behalf, accusing the crimes of the ruling class. The truth expressed in the poem is the essence extracted from many similar facts, and it is typical. The old woman in Shihao has existed and has not existed. There may not be people and things in life that completely coincide with this, but people and things similar to this have existed, and there are many. The poet extracts the most prominent features from them, expands and deepens them, and gives them sharpness and clarity, and uses them to summarize on one person—this kind of writing technique is called art. In this regard, Du Fu was completely successful. Even more than a thousand years later, the Kuomintang reactionary government ordered to prohibit the teaching of this poem in schools, which can be a strong side proof. The works hated by the reactionaries are precisely the works loved by the people.
    In the long feudal society, many parasitic literati emerged. Separated from creative labor, separated from the labor that makes people noble, they lost the realistic significance of life, became empty, and degenerated into what Gorky called "empty souls." Ruan Ji can testify. This poet, one of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, has always been regarded as the standard of a wise man and a typical representative of a celebrity. His eighty-two poems of "Singing My Thoughts" have always been praised by all critics for thousands of years as masterpieces of five-character poetry. But what does he "sing" and what does he "think"? He said: "I can't even protect myself, let alone love my wife and children? Frost covers the wild grass, and the end of the year is also over." (Part 3.) "Tombs cover the hills, and all ages are the same. After thousands of years, where will the glory be!" (Part 15.) The poems are full of pessimism and disappointment, and have no positive significance. Why? Because the life of a parasite is like duckweed on water, so it is impossible to have the same healthy emotions as the working people. There are many such examples. For example, after the fall of the Northern Song Dynasty, Xin Qiji fought guerrillas, so he could have such a strong statement of struggle as "I will be an iron-willed man until death" ("He Xin Liang"); but Jiang Kui, who was as famous as him, could only write such sentences: "It's a pity that a piece of land is all entrusted to the cuckoos!" ("Ba Gui".) When the Southern Song Dynasty fell, Zhang Yan, who was as famous as Jiang Kui, said: "The short dream is still Jiangbiao, and the old tears are sprinkled on Xizhou. There is no title in one word, and the fallen leaves are all sad!" ("Ganzhou".) Because Jiang Kui was just a poor scholar who only knew how to beg for help, and Zhang Yan was just a fallen prince. Compared with the "Even if you are copper walls and iron walls! Even if you are a relative of the emperor!" praised by Mr. Lu Xun in Mulian Rescuing His Mother, how vigorous and fresh is the latter's masterpiece, and who can deny that it is the most worthy thing to be accepted in the literary heritage?
    Obviously, the classical literature course contains extremely strong ideological and political content. If taught well, it can promote patriotic thoughts, help cultivate young writers, and promote the construction of new democracy. If taught poorly, it will spread the toxins of feudal ideology, hinder students' progress, and thus hinder the development of the motherland. Unfortunately, most of the people who take this course are old intellectuals who came from the old China. They are being reformed but cannot replace the stand, viewpoint and method of the exploiting class and petty-bourgeoisie with the stand, viewpoint and method of the working class. They cannot integrate themselves with the workers, peasants and soldiers in thought and emotion, cannot correctly analyze and criticize past literary works, and cannot successfully complete the teaching task of this course. On "May Day" Labor Day last year, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference issued slogans to celebrate, calling on every people's teacher to arm themselves with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. This call is completely correct and completely necessary, especially for teachers of classical literature. I put forward a solemn request to all my colleagues: conscientiously study Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and conscientiously implement Mao Zedong's literary and art thought in the teaching of classical literature.

    把毛泽东文艺思想贯彻到古典文学的教学中去
    山东大学副校长　陆侃如
    自从一九四二年五月毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表以来，已经十年多了。在这部经典性的天才著作里，卓越地阐明了作为马克思列宁主义和中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想组成部分之一的文艺思想，明确地指出了人民文艺工作的方针和路线，深刻地解决了工作中的基本问题，即文艺和工农兵结合的问题。十年多来，在毛主席的教导下，一般文艺工作者们批判了“灵魂深处”的“小资产阶级的王国”，决心“到群众中去”，决心在“火热的斗争中”锻炼自己，改造自己，提高自己。光荣地获得斯大林奖金的“太阳照在桑干河上”、“暴风骤雨”和“白毛女”足够证明新中国的人民文艺正在健康地生长，迅速地壮大。同时也从工农兵中间涌现出了一些作家，如高玉宝、陈登科等。如果没有这篇富有指导作用的讲话，这些巨大的成就是不能想像的。
    当然我们不能满足于已获得的成绩，我们离开毛主席给我们规定的任务还有不短的距离，我们还须继续为毛主席所提出的文艺方向而斗争。但是，尽管在创作上、在批评工作上，我们还存在着无数急待克服的缺点，其缺点的严重性也远不如文学遗产接受问题方面的厉害。特别是在高等学校的古典文学教学工作上，不但是资产阶级的或小资产阶级的文艺思想占领导地位，甚至封建的或法西斯的也仍存在。某些还没有经过好好改造的旧知识分子，不但在讲解古典作品时向青年学生散播腐朽思想，而且在批改写作或教授其他文艺课程时也同样夹杂有来自封建文艺的毒素。如果说在创作和批评方面我们还没有把毛泽东文艺思想贯彻得足够，那么在古典文学的教学方面简直还没有开始贯彻呢。
    首先我们应该明确指出古典文学课程的目的和要求。我们知道：现在我们进行的教育，是新民主主义的教育。我们一切课程，不管是文、理、工、农、医，不管是那一院、系、科、组，虽然每一门的具体内容千差万别，然而教学的目标却只有一个——就是为我们伟大的、可爱的祖国服务，为新民主主义的建设服务，为勤劳勇敢的工农大众服务，而不是为我们自己个人的利益或兴趣服务。政务院和教育部在毛泽东思想的原则指导下，为了具体说明每门课程的目的和要求，曾经明确地指出两点：第一，每门课程必须和祖国的建设任务密切配合；第二，在每门课程里必须贯彻爱国主义思想教育。在这一方面，古典文学决不能是例外。
    高尔基说得好：“开始写作的人，必须具备有文学史的知识。……在每一种事业里，就必须知道这种事业的发展的历史。假如每一个生产部门的工人，更正确地说——假如每一个工厂的工人，都知道这个生产部门、这个工厂是怎样产生的，怎样逐渐发展起来，怎样完成了生产的话，——那么这些工人们，他们对于他们的劳作的文化和历史的意义，有着更深刻的了解，并且还怀着更大的兴趣，一定会比现在工作得更好。………科学所得到的神话故事般的成功，科学的迅速发展，这正是因为科学家知道自己专门学科的发展的历史。”（戈宝权译“我怎样学习写作”，三联版，一——四页。）因此，苏联青年作家们所学习的课程，“除了必须学习的马列主义、政治经济学课程之外，占学习中钟点最主要部分的是文学史、古代文学、民间文学、苏联文学、文学理论、诗、小说、儿童文学，以及各民族文学史，各民主国家文学史”，而且还“要设立中国文学史的专门研究课程”。（刘白羽“访问文学院和阿扎耶夫”，载文艺报第三卷第四期，三一页。）我们必须记住，现在的斗争和过去的斗争是血肉相连的。因此，即使在我们创造新事物的时候，我们仍然是发展着我们祖先过去已经开始了的事业。我们要求青年作家学习古典文学，就是要求他们尽量吸收过去人民为美好的将来而作的社会斗争的伟大经验，这种经验都积蓄在优秀的文学遗产里。我们应该学习过去伟大作家们揭穿假面具的精神，学习他们暴露社会发展的内部矛盾的勇气。我们“不但要懂得今天，还要懂得昨天与前天。”对过去没有了解，也就不能了解现在。
    因此，讲授古典文学的教师的责任便非常重大。我们把过去的杰作介绍给青年，为的是宣传我们祖先在文学中所创造的重要的和美好的东西。正确的古典文学研究者不能不是热情的爱国主义者，不能不欣喜于每一篇表现历史上中国人民的伟大形象的作品。三千年来，无数的富有人民性的优秀作家，他们写了永远不会被人遗忘的作品，他们在这些作品中歌颂着刚勇，歌颂着不屈的反抗，歌颂着真挚而自由的爱。新中国的人民已经发展成现在的样子，他们要超越过去，发展向更高的阶段。除了伟大的古典文学以外，又有什么东西能使我们更深刻地了解过去的世界呢？伟大的作家出生在伟大的民族里，伟大的民族表现在伟大的作品里。古典文学的学习不能不使我们爱国主义的思想提高了一大步，假使我们的教师能够正确地讲授的话。
    马克思列宁主义告诉我们：在任何民族的文化中都有两种文化。一种是为统治阶级服务的文化，一种是为被压迫劳苦大众服务的文化。文学也是如此。用法捷耶夫的话来说，就是一部分是被人民盖章批准的，一部分是没有被盖章批准的。被批准的就是毛主席所说的遗产中的“民主性的精华”，没有被批准的就是遗产中的“封建性的糟粕”。我们对于古典文学既不应估价得过高，也不应估价得过低。如果把“封建性的糟粕”也当作宝贝，那是莫大的错误；如果连“民主性的精华”也唾弃了，那个错误也不算小。因为马克思列宁主义并没有教我们把旧社会的最珍贵的成就完全抛弃，相反地，它教我们把几千年来人类历史发展中有价值的东西加以摄取和改造。毛主席也一再教导我们：对于遗产“既不是一概排斥，也不是盲目服从，而是批判地接收它”。新中国的人民文艺的创造，必然要直接继承古典文学的优秀传统，而教师则应负正确批判之责。
    和一般的文艺批评一样，古典文学的鉴定有两个标准：一个是政治标准，一个是艺术标准。按照政治标准来说，一切反对倒退，促成进步的东西，都是好的；一切反对进步，拉着人们倒退的东西，都是坏的。按照艺术标准来说，一切艺术性较高的，就是“更有组织性，更有集中性，更典型，更理想，因此就更带普遍性”的，是好的，反之，便是不好的。毛主席又说：“无论什么样的阶级社会与无论什么阶级社会中各别阶级，总是以政治标准放在第一位，以艺术标准放在第二位。………内容愈反动的作品愈带艺术性，就愈能毒害人民，就愈应该排斥。”文艺批评不是宣传自己私人的口味，私人的爱好，和私人的憎恶的活动场所。我们重视文学，因为我们很明确地看到它在教育和团结人民中的作用，它在加强人民思想上和政治上一致性的作用；因为我们确信文学是了解和改造世界的工具，是群众革命斗争的有力武器；如果否认了文学作品的政治意义，那不是提高文学的地位，而相反地贬低了文学的价值，因为这等于剥夺了它的最主要的活动力，即它的思想性。加里宁说：“一个真正的艺术家必须用他底作品去提高人类思想的发展；一个作家没有为自己规定这种目的，那仅是半个作家”。（引见波格洛夫“加里宁论文艺”，载人民文学第二卷第二期，二九页。）同样，我们可以说：一个文艺批评家如果不把提高人类思想的发展规定为自己的目的，那也只是半个批评家。古典文学教师也是如此。我们在鉴定一部古典文学作品时，所寻求的基本问题是：它对人民有所裨益吗？它发扬了读者的积极品质吗？它对我们思想的进展和道德的进展有所贡献吗？等等。
    政治标准重于艺术标准，但在伟大的作品里，深刻的思想内容必然地和高度的艺术形式达到了有机的结合。例如杜甫的“石壕吏”这首诗，产生于安史乱中，当时拉伕的现象是很普遍的。杜甫是个伟大的人道主义者，他热爱人民，同情于被压迫的劳苦大众，替他们提出控诉，控诉统治阶级的罪行。诗中所表现的真实，是从同类的许多事实中提炼出来的精萃，它是典型化了的。石壕的老妪存在过，又没有存在过。在人生中未必有与此完全吻合的人与事，不过与此类似的人与事却存在过，而且很多。诗人从其中抽出最突出的特征，加以扩大和深入，赋以尖锐性和明确性，拿来概括在一个人身上——这样的写作手法，才叫做艺术。在这一点上，杜甫是完全成功的。直到一千多年后，国民党反动政府还下令禁止在学校里讲授这首诗，可做个有力的旁证。反动派痛恨的作品，正是人民热爱的作品。
    在长期的封建社会里，产生了不少的寄生的文人。脱离了创造性的劳动，脱离了使人高贵起来的劳动，他们丧失了生活的现实意义，变得空虚了，退化而成高尔基所谓“空虚的灵魂”。阮籍可以作证。这个竹林七贤之一的诗人，一向被认为达人的标准，名士的典型。他的咏怀诗八十二首，一向被千余年来所有的批评家赞美为五言诗的杰作。然而他“咏”的什么“怀”呢？他说：“一身自不保，何况恋妻子？凝霜被野草，岁暮亦云已。”（其三。）“丘墓蔽山冈，万代同一时。千秋万岁后，荣名安所之！”（其十五。）诗中充满了悲观、失望，毫无积极的意义。为什么？因为寄生虫的生活好比水上浮萍，所以不可能有和劳动人民同样健康的情感。这种例证很多。如北宋亡国后，辛弃疾打过游击，所以能有“道男儿到死心如铁”（贺新凉）那样富有斗争性的壮语；但和他齐名的姜夔却只能写这样的句子：“最可惜一片江山，总付与啼鴂！”（八归。）到南宋亡的时候，和姜夔并称的张炎说：“短梦依然江表，老泪洒西州。一字无题处，落叶都愁！”（甘州。）因为姜夔是个只会打抽丰的清客，而张炎也只是个落魄的王孙。若和鲁迅先生所称许的目莲救母里的“哪怕你铜墙铁壁！哪怕你皇亲国戚！”相比较，那么后者是多么刚健和清新的绝唱，谁能否认它是文学遗产中最值得接受的东西呢？
    很显然，古典文学课程包含有极强的思想性和政治性。教得好，它可以提高爱国主义的思想，可以帮助青年作家的培养，可以推进新民主主义的建设。教得不好，它便传播封建思想的毒素，阻碍学生的进步，因而妨害了祖国的发展。不幸的是，担任这门课程的人大都是从旧中国里过来的旧知识分子，正在改造而还不能以工人阶级的立场、观点、方法来代替剥削阶级，小资产阶级的立场、观点、方法，还不能使自己在思想上、感情上和工农大众打成一片，还不能正确地分析批判过去的文学作品，还不能胜利地完成这门课程的教学任务。去年“五一”劳动节，人民政协全国委员会发布庆祝的口号，号召每一位人民教师都以马克思列宁主义及毛泽东思想武装自己。这个号召是完全正确的，也是完全必要的，特别是对于古典文学的教师们。我对所有和我同行的朋友们提出一个严肃的要求：认真地学习毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，认真地把毛泽东文艺思想贯彻到古典文学的教学中去。
