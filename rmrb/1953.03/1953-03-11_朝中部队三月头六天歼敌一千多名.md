Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 9th: Frequent battles have occurred on the Korean front since March 1st. Up to the 6th, the Korean and Chinese People’s Armies have fought more than 30 engagements with the enemy, annihilating over 1,000 enemy soldiers.

	Starting at 00:05 on March 1st, our troops on the eastern front, after a 30-minute battle, captured a hill southwest of Guandaili, east of Kimhwa, completely wiping out two platoons of the defending ROK (Republic of Korea) 6th Division troops. On the evening of the 3rd, the enemy sent a platoon to reconnoiter, but they were repelled by our artillery fire. Subsequently, the enemy launched five counterattacks on this high ground, but all were repelled by our defending troops and powerful artillery fire. Around 13:00 on the 4th, the enemy bombarded the hills in this area with over 7,000 shells (including 30 gas shells), and then sent four aircraft to strafe repeatedly six times, dropping 50 bombs. Following this, they launched three consecutive attacks on this high ground with a battalion of troops divided into three routes, but were all repelled. Up to the late night of the 5th, our troops had engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy on this hill for three days, annihilating a total of more than 460 enemy soldiers.

	In order to reverse the disastrous defeat at the hill southwest of Guandaili, the enemy launched another attack on a hill to the left of Sangam-ryeong village, north of Kimhwa, on the morning of the 5th. The enemy used four or more companies of troops to attack a small high ground to the southeast of our main position on this hill. From morning to noon, the enemy launched nine consecutive attacks, but all were repelled. Around 13:00, the enemy attacked again, occupying a small area in front of this small high ground, but it was recaptured by our troops that night. On the morning of the 6th, the enemy furiously bombarded the hills in this area, firing more than 8,000 shells in just over an hour. They also dropped a large number of smoke bombs from aircraft to cover the infantry attack. The two platoons that managed to climb up suffered heavy casualties from our artillery fire. This fierce battle lasted for 30 hours, resulting in the annihilation of over 300 enemy soldiers.

	In addition, during these six days, our troops captured three enemy positions in areas west of Lianchuan and southeast of Kimhwa, completely wiping out one enemy platoon and three squads, totaling more than 120 enemy soldiers. On the night of the 1st, our troops on the western front, after a ten-minute battle, captured the position of a reinforced platoon of the US 2nd Division in front of Gao Wang Mountain, west of Lianchuan, killing 83 enemy soldiers.

	During these six days, our troops also annihilated more than 180 enemy soldiers in ambush and blocking operations.

	From March 1st to 6th, our front-line mobile artillery killed or wounded 336 enemy soldiers; front-line anti-aircraft artillery shot down five enemy aircraft and damaged twelve.

    朝中部队三月头六天歼敌一千多名 【新华社朝鲜前线九日电】三月一日以后，朝鲜前线战斗频繁，到六日为止，朝中人民军队已与敌军作战三十多次，歼灭敌人一千多名。
    一日夜十二时五分开始，东线我军经三十分钟战斗，攻下金城以东官岱里西南的一座山头，全歼守敌李伪军第六师两个排。三日黄昏，敌人派一个排前来侦察，被我军炮火击退。以后敌人又向这一高地反扑五次，都被我军守备部队和强大炮火击退。四日下午一时许，敌人向这一带山岭炮轰七千余发
    （内有三十发毒气弹），并派出四架飞机反复扫射六次，投弹五十枚之后，以一营人分三路向这个高地连续攻击三次，都被击退。到五日深夜为止，我军在这个山岭上已与敌军激战三天，共歼敌四百六十多名。
    敌人为了挽回官岱里西南山的惨败，于五日清晨再次向金化以北上甘岭村左边的一座山岭发动进攻。敌人使用了四个多连的兵力，进攻这个山岭上我军主要阵地东南的一个小高地。敌人从早晨到中午，连续攻击九次，都被击退。至下午一时许，敌人再度攻击，占去这个小高地前的一个小地方，但在当夜就为我军夺回。六日早晨，敌人疯狂炮轰这一带山岭，在一个多小时内即发炮八千多发，又由飞机投下大量烟幕弹掩护步兵进攻。爬上来的两个班遭到我军炮火杀伤大半。这一场激战持续了三十个小时，共计歼敌三百多名。
    此外，在这六天中，我军在涟川以西和金城东南等地攻下三个敌军阵地，全歼守敌一个排又三个班，共计一百二十多名。一日夜，西线我军经十多分钟激战，攻下涟川以西高旺山前美军第二师一个加强排的阵地，计歼敌八十三名。
    在这六天中，我军在伏击、阻击等战斗中亦歼敌一百八十多名。
