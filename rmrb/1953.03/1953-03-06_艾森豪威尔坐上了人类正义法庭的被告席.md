Eisenhower Sits in the Defendant's Seat at the Tribunal of Human Justice
Cui Qi

October 12, 1952, was the 460th anniversary of Columbus's discovery of America. In previous years, the American people always celebrated it with historical reminiscence. But on this day last year, they were agitated by a despicable thing done by the American government: the US Supreme Court once again barbarously insisted on carrying out the death sentence for the innocent Rosenberg couple. Did the rulers of the United States want to commemorate this historically significant day in such a shocking way? In fact, they don't like the past history of the United States, and they have long been disgusted with the term "New World." The American rulers fabricated the so-called "atomic spy case" of the Rosenberg couple, just as they buried the original manuscript of the "Declaration of Independence" not long ago, which showed that they had openly abandoned the mask of bourgeois democracy and put on the fascist shroud worn by Hitler. How could those free European immigrants who crossed the ocean to the New World more than four hundred years ago have imagined that today, more than four hundred years later, the land they worked so hard to develop has become the darkest place in the world: there is no freedom, no justice; it is a paradise for murderers and a hell for peace-loving people.

Truman, Eisenhower, and their ilk are determined to murder the Rosenbergs not only because they hate the Rosenbergs, but because they hate all peace-loving people. Their premeditated murder of the Rosenbergs is nothing more than preparation for a larger-scale murder—plunging all mankind into the bloodbath of war. Haven't people just heard the rants of the warmongers? Truman and Eisenhower, imitating the tone of the madman Forrestal, who jumped from a building, shouted to the American people: "We are heading towards an unpredictable peak of destructive power!" "If one thing can be certain in the future, it is that we will have to make some sacrifices in the future," "The American people must gladly accept any sacrifice, and no one, no family, no society can stand outside this call." The threat of death is standing next to the Rosenbergs, and the shadow of war is hanging over the heads of every American. The Rosenbergs are victims of the warmongers' political conspiracy. Truman and Eisenhower sacrificed the Rosenbergs as sacrifices to the altar of the god of war in order to make a promise to the American sixty families and big arms dealers—just as the superstitious people of ancient times sacrificed the young lives of a couple to monsters. In a country ruled by murderers, there is no shortage of excuses to murder two good citizens. In this way, the US government is even preparing to put the Rosenbergs to death in the electric chair....

People are reminded of Europe in the dark Middle Ages. At that time, the reactionary "Inquisition" used firewood to burn alive those who insisted on the truth. Today, the American rulers who believe in the monsters of war and fascism have also turned their courts into "Inquisitions" to persecute peace-loving people. Their barbarity and cruelty are no less than the reactionary forces of the Middle Ages, but the primitive firewood has been replaced by "civilized" electric chairs. Isn't this a great insult to human dignity and civilization! We seem to hear Benjamin Franklin, who once wanted to bring the lightning from the sky to benefit mankind, crying in the underground of the United States....

The Rosenbergs are just two ordinary American citizens. They said: "We are not martyrs, nor are we heroes, and we don't want to be martyrs or heroes. We don't want to die, we are innocent." They are still very young, they hope to have a long and beneficial life, and they hope to see their children grow up. They are not as full of sorrow for the future as the warmongers, but they love life and believe in tomorrow. They are loyal to democracy, justice and friendship, and what they need is peace, bread, roses and the innocent laughter of children. However, to Truman and Eisenhower, all this is very hateful and very terrible. Because if everyone is like this, no one will follow Truman's madness, and no one will be willing to carry Eisenhower's "soldier's backpack" to a distant land to kill and be killed.

The insidious and clumsy Truman and Eisenhower were confident that sentencing the Rosenbergs to death would "kill one to warn a hundred" and make the peace-loving American people "feel insecure." But stubborn facts soon surprised themselves. The American people have risen up to protest against the murderers, and it is getting stronger and stronger. The support of the people has added infinite strength to the Rosenbergs in their struggle with the executioners. They raised their heads in the face of death and said: "Death does not seem more terrible than giving up all social responsibility and giving up a mediocre life of unwavering courage." They love life, so they refuse to trade life for betraying the truth. Here is the real voice of the American people, here is the spark of freedom. The fascist rulers of the United States cannot stifle the flame of freedom burning in the hearts of these upright American people.

People all over the world have risen up to condemn the shameful murderers, and they have made a huge voice: stop the bloody hands of the warmongers and save the Rosenbergs! As a result, the innocent people who were sentenced to death did not bow their heads, but the people who wanted to kill people with electric chairs began to tremble. Although Eisenhower and Truman and their ilk can convict and execute peace-loving people in the court of Foley Square in New York, in another court—the great court of justice of progressive humanity all over the world—they are sitting in the defendant's seat under the accusations of hundreds of millions of people.

    艾森豪威尔坐上了人类正义法庭的被告席
    崔奇
    一九五二年十月十二日是哥伦布发现美洲的四百六十周年纪念日。往年，美国人民总要怀着历史的追想来庆祝它。但是在去年的这一天，他们却被美国政府做下的一件卑鄙的事情所激动：美国最高法院再一次横蛮地坚持了对无辜的罗森堡夫妇执行死刑的判决。难道美国的统治者是要用这种骇人听闻的方式来纪念这个有历史意义的日子吗？其实，他们并不喜欢美国过去的历史，他们对“新大陆”这个名词也早就感到厌恶了。美国统治者制造了罗森堡夫妇的所谓“原子间谍案”，正同不久以前他们把“独立宣言”的原稿埋葬到地下一样，乃是表示他们已公开地抛弃了资产阶级民主的面具，而披上了希特勒穿过的法西斯的尸衣。那些在四百多年前远渡重洋到新大陆上来的自由的欧洲移民们，怎么会想到，在四百多年后的今天，他们所辛勤开拓的国土已成为世界上最黑暗的地方：这儿没有自由，没有正义；这儿是杀人犯的乐园，是和平人民的地狱。
    杜鲁门、艾森豪威尔之流，决心谋杀罗森堡夫妇，绝不只是由于他们痛恨罗森堡夫妇，而是痛恨所有爱好和平的人民。他们蓄意谋杀罗森堡夫妇，不过是为了准备制造更大规模的谋杀——把全人类都投进战争的血泊。人们不是刚刚听过战争贩子的狂叫吗？杜鲁门和艾森豪威尔摹仿着已经跳楼的疯子福莱斯特尔的口吻，向美国人民大喊：“我们正向着毁灭力量的还不可预测的高峰奔去！”“如果将来有一件事可以确定的话，那便是我们将来还要作些牺牲”，“美国人民对任何牺牲都必须欣然承受，不能有任何人、任何家庭、任何社会置身于这个号召之外。”死亡的威胁正站在罗森堡夫妇的身旁，战争的黑影则笼罩在每一个美国人民的头上。罗森堡夫妇是战争贩子政治阴谋的牺牲。杜鲁门和艾森豪威尔是为了向美国六十家族和大军火商人许愿，才把罗森堡夫妇作为祭品送上奉祀战神的供桌的——这正同古时的迷信者用一对男女的青春生命献给妖怪一样。在杀人犯统治的国家，要想谋害两个善良的公民，是不愁没有借口的。就这样，美国政府竟准备把罗森堡夫妇放到电椅上处死……。
    人们想起黑暗的中世纪的欧洲。那时候，反动的“异教裁判所”曾用柴火把坚持真理的人们活活烧死。如今，信奉战争和法西斯妖怪的美国统治者，也把他们的法庭变成了“异教裁判所”，用来迫害爱好和平的人民。他们的野蛮和残暴的程度，比起中世纪的反动势力毫无逊色，不过原始的柴火已改为“文明”的电椅而已。难道这不是对人类尊严和文明的极大污辱吗！我们仿佛听到了那位曾经想把天上的雷电取来为人类谋福利的佛兰克林，在美国的地下哭泣……。
    罗森堡夫妇不过是两个普通的美国公民。他们说：“我们不是殉道者，也不是英雄，我们也不想当殉道者和英雄。我们不要死，我们是无罪的。”他们还很年轻，他们希望有一个长的有益的生命，希望看到他们的孩子长大成人。他们并不像战争贩子那样全身都浸透着对未来的悲哀，而是爱生活，和相信明天的。他们忠实于民主、正义和友爱，他们需要的是和平、面包、玫瑰和孩子们无邪的笑。然而，对杜鲁门和艾森豪威尔说来，这一切却是非常可恨，非常可怕的。因为如果每人都这样，那就不会有人跟着杜鲁门发疯了，就不会有人愿意背起艾森豪威尔的“士兵的背包”到远乡异土去杀人和被杀了。
    心地阴险而头脑拙劣的杜鲁门和艾森豪威尔，满以为宣判罗森堡夫妇的死刑，就会“杀一儆百”，就会使爱好和平的美国人民“人人自危”起来。但是顽强的事实不久就使他们自己吃惊了。美国人民纷纷起来向谋杀者提出抗议，并且越来越强烈。人民的支持使罗森堡夫妇在和刽子手进行斗争中增添了无穷力量。他们在死亡的面前昂起头来说道：“死亡好像并不比放弃一切社会责任和放弃坚定不移的勇敢的碌碌一生更可怕些”。他们爱生命，所以他们不肯以背叛真理来换取生命。这儿是真正的美国人民的声音，这儿闪耀着自由的火花。美国的法西斯统治者是无法窒息这些燃烧在正直的美国人民心中的自由之火的。
    世界各地人民都起来指责可耻的谋杀者，他们发出巨大的声音：制止战争贩子的血手，拯救罗森堡夫妇！于是，被判处死刑的无罪的人并没有低头，而抱着电椅要杀人的人却发起抖来了。尽管艾森豪威尔和杜鲁门之流可以在纽约福莱广场的法庭上对和平人民判罪处死，但是在另一个法庭上——全世界进步人类的伟大的正义法庭上，他们却在亿万人民的指控下坐上了被告席。
