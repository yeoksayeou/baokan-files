Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 13th. The U.S. side has killed and wounded three more of our captured personnel. According to the U.S. side's announcement, on March 10th, in the U.S. side's Jeju Island prisoner of war camp, one captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers was wounded and is in serious condition. On March 11th, another prisoner of war was beaten to death on Jeju Island. The U.S. side fabricated the excuse that the prisoner of war had assaulted U.S. personnel. On the same day, on Longcao Island, another prisoner of war was wounded while being questioned by a U.S. sergeant. These incidents of killing prisoners of war show that the captured personnel of Korea and China are resolutely resisting the U.S. side's crimes of forcing them to serve as cannon fodder.

    美方又杀伤战俘三人
    【新华社开城十三日电】美方又连续打死打伤我方被俘人员三名。据美方宣布，三月十日，在美方济州岛战俘营中有一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员被打伤，伤势严重。三月十一日，在济州岛上又有一名战俘被打死，美方制造的借口是说这名战俘殴打美方人员。同一天，在龙草岛上，又有一名战俘在被一个美国上士询问时被打伤。从这些杀害战俘的事件中可以看出，朝中被俘人员正在坚决反抗美方强迫他们充当炮灰的罪行。
