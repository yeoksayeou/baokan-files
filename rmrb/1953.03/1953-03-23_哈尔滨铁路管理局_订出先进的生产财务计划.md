    Harbin Railway Administration
    Formulates Advanced Production and Financial Plan
    The Harbin Railway Administration, consolidating the achievements of the former Chinese Changchun Railway, has formulated an advanced 1953 production and financial plan. Taking the area under the jurisdiction of the former Chinese Changchun Railway Bureau as an example, the annual planned figures for this year, compared with the actual figures completed last year, show a 20.6 percent increase in labor productivity, a 5.4 percent decrease in transportation costs, and a 17.3 percent increase in operating profit.
    During the formulation and discussion of the plan, the Harbin Railway Administration waged a struggle against conservative thinking among cadres. After the handover of the Chinese Changchun Railway, some cadres developed the idea of "a sigh of relief," thinking that the requirements of various indicators had been very strict in the past few years, and "it can be wider in the future"; some cadres, including individual leading cadres, did not correctly understand the "consolidation" of consolidating the existing achievements of the original Chinese Changchun Railway, thinking that incorporating last year's indicator figures into this year's plan was considered consolidation. The leadership of the管理局 (railway administration) resolutely struggled against these conservative ideas. They carefully analyzed the 1952 final accounting data and fully estimated the effect of continuing to promote various advanced Soviet work experiences. During the discussion of the plan, many units mobilized the masses to check the implementation of advanced Soviet experience in the former Chinese Changchun Railway. For example, in the Mudanjiang Locomotive Depot's inspection of the implementation of Zheng Xikun's operating method, Luning's locomotive maintenance method, and Gorbunov's operating method, it was found that only four of the twenty-five contracted crew groups were qualified in implementing all three experiences, thirteen groups were qualified in implementing only two, and eight groups were qualified in implementing only one. This shows that if the advanced Soviet experience promoted by the former Chinese Changchun Railway is continued in the future, the production potential can be further developed.

    哈尔滨铁路管理局
    订出先进的生产财务计划
    哈尔滨铁路管理局巩固原中长路的成果，已制订出先进的一九五三年生产财务计划。以原中长铁路局辖区为例，今年全年计划的数字和去年实际完成的数字相比，劳动生产率提高百分之二十点六，运输成本降低百分之五点四，运营利润提高百分之十七点三。
    哈尔滨铁路管理局在制订和讨论计划中曾经和干部中的保守思想作了斗争。中长路移交后，有一部分干部产生了“松一口气”的思想，以为过去几年各项指标的要求很严，“今后可以宽一点了”；有一部分干部包括个别领导干部在内，对巩固原中长路既有成果的“巩固”了解得不正确，以为把去年的指标数字重复编进今年的计划就算是巩固了。管理局领导方面对这些保守思想进行了坚决的斗争。他们详细分析了一九五二年的决算资料，并对继续推行各项苏联先进工作经验的效果作了充分估计，在讨论计划中，很多单位都发动群众检查了原中长路推行苏联先进经验的情况。例如牡丹江机务段关于推行郑锡坤操作法、鲁宁机车保养法和高尔布果夫操作法的检查中，发现在二十五个包乘组中推行三种经验都合格的只有四个组，有十三个组推行的只有两种合格，有八个组推行的只有一种合格。这说明今后如果继续推行原中长路时所推行的苏联先进经验，生产潜力还可以得到更大的发挥。（新华社）
