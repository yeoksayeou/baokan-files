To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, dear comrades:

Upon learning the sad news of the passing of Comrade Gottwald, the respected leader of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Czechoslovak people, and a close friend of the Chinese people, we extend our deepest condolences to you with extreme sorrow.

Comrade Gottwald was a loyal student of Comrades Lenin and Stalin and an outstanding fighter of the international workers' movement. He led the Czechoslovak people in a resolute and courageous struggle against German Nazis for the independence and freedom of Czechoslovakia. After Czechoslovakia was liberated, Comrade Gottwald led the Czechoslovak people to crush the conspiracies of reactionary forces at home and abroad, enabling Czechoslovakia to embark victoriously on the road of building socialism and making great contributions to the cause of world peace and democracy.

The passing of Comrade Gottwald is a great loss not only for the Czechoslovak people but also for the world peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China firmly believes that the Chinese people and the Czechoslovak people will unite even more closely with the Soviet people and the people of all people's democratic countries, heighten vigilance, and fight to the end for the cause of peace and democracy, and for the cause of communism.

Comrade Gottwald will live forever in our memory!

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
March 15, 1953, Beijing
