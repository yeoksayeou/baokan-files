    Northeast China Intensively Prepares for Basic Construction
    Construction of Over 3 Million Square Meters of Building Area to Begin Next Month
    [This newspaper dispatch] Northeast China is now in the most intensive stage of preparation for basic construction. In April, construction of between 3 million and 3.5 million square meters of building area will begin.
    This year's basic construction scale in Northeast China is very large. The preliminary determined total amount of basic construction work is 84 percent higher than in 1952. Among them are new, modern iron and steel plants, power stations, oil factories, vertical shafts, inclined shafts, open-pit mines, heavy machinery factories and other projects. To cooperate with basic construction, the region's urban construction investment reached over 800 billion yuan.
    Last August, Northeast China began preparations for this year's basic construction projects. In the fourth quarter of last year, the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee made some plans and regulations for strengthening design work, rectifying construction forces, fixing and training construction workers, pre-allocating reserve materials, and compiling the 1953 basic construction plan. All basic construction departments summarized past experiences and lessons, and carried out various preparations intensively. All departments transferred a large number of cadres and technical workers to strengthen institutions, and at the same time strengthened leadership over basic construction. According to statistics from nine administrative bureaus, including the Electric Power, Electrical Appliance, and Non-Ferrous Metals Bureaus, more than 23,000 people were transferred from production departments and other aspects in the past three months to strengthen survey and design and construction institutions. One hundred and twenty-six various professional and comprehensive engineering companies and design companies have been established throughout the region.
    The construction units gathered and trained construction forces in a timely manner. There are already 167,000 fixed workers in the region (including the engineering companies of various central ministries in Northeast China), of which technical workers account for 70 percent. More than 120,000 fixed workers have participated in winter training since last December. After more than two months of political education, their political awareness has been significantly improved, and they are currently engaged in technical learning.
    In terms of survey and design work, the design of more than 20 key projects for heavy industrial construction has been completed. As of the end of February, the Design Company of the Central Heavy Industry Department had completed 28 standard designs, including dormitories, middle schools, warehouses, bathhouses, etc. Preliminary calculations show that at least over 2 million square meters of building area can use these standard designs, and over 180,000 square meters of building area can use old design drawings. The design strength of various provinces and cities has increased by 83 percent compared to last November. Many departments have examined the design ideology among design personnel, focusing on criticizing the irresponsible attitude of blindly designing and the technical viewpoints of the bourgeoisie, as well as the tendency to neglect technical safety and labor protection in design. At the same time, they have further promoted the advanced design experience of the Soviet Union.
    Preparations have also been actively made for mechanized construction. In addition to the fact that key projects have ordered a batch of construction machinery from abroad, the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee also equipped the construction units of local state-owned industries with a portion of construction machinery in the fourth quarter of last year to meet construction needs, so that heavy operations such as high-altitude and short-distance transportation, on-site transportation, concrete mixing, drainage and road rolling can gradually move towards mechanized operations. All construction units are also actively inspecting and repairing existing machinery and equipment and training operating workers.
    The new difficulty in the preparation work is the issue of equipment ordering. For example, units such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Electric Power and Non-Ferrous Metals Bureaus need huge quantities and a wide variety of steel equipment, electrical and drilling machinery this year. Some units have experienced disconnections due to changes in leadership relationships. At present, close attention must be paid to ensuring on-time delivery and quality specifications. From the perspective of the entire Northeast region, the supply of building materials can basically meet the needs of commencement of construction, but the preparation of various units is extremely unbalanced. Some units have stored enough red bricks and wood for the whole year; while other units are far behind in the preparation of materials and construction requirements because the plans were set too late; some have not even considered the storage of materials, or no one is in charge of material work, and the material supply plan has not been formulated. Therefore, this is a problem that must be closely watched and quickly studied and resolved.
    This year's basic construction preparation work in Northeast China has made progress compared with last year, but there are still some ideological and work issues that must be resolved.
    At present, the most prominent and widespread ideological problem in the basic construction departments of Northeast China is the idea of waiting and relying. Party A and Party B, superiors and subordinates rely on and wait for each other, which affects the progress of preparation work to a certain extent. Some departments have generated complaints among the cadres below because the plan has not been finalized for a long time. This is due to an insufficient understanding of the specific circumstances and characteristics of the country's large-scale basic construction, that is, the country has entered a new period of economic construction, with very strict requirements for the speed and quality of construction, but the experience and subjective strength of all aspects are insufficient, and there are also some difficulties on the objective side, which leads to contradictions. In this case, it is necessary to advocate the spirit of actively and proactively overcoming difficulties, and oppose various negative emotions and attitudes.
    Some specific problems affecting the preparation work are: the plan is determined too slowly and changes frequently; the design strength is insufficient and the design level is low, which makes the design slow and inaccurate, and at the same time, the untimely and inaccurate supply of geological data affects the progress of foreign design; the management of materials and equipment is still very chaotic, the quality of bricks, tiles, sand and gravel is poor, the transportation plan is not well completed, and most of the ordering of plumbing equipment and small hardware has not yet started; the allocation of labor is unbalanced, and there is still a lack of appropriate adjustment of special types of work and technical personnel; financial work still cannot keep up with the needs of construction preparation, investment allocations are slow, and some systems are not reasonably stipulated; the coordination of all aspects with basic construction is insufficient, and some regions and some departments have not yet taken action to fully support basic construction.
    Therefore, all competent business departments and basic construction units in Northeast China must give play to the spirit of initiative and continue to step up preparation work: financial committees and competent business departments at all levels should quickly conduct project ranking, determine the projects to be started in the first phase, and conduct another inspection of the preparation work according to the order that has been ranked; quickly organize relevant parties to review design drawings; specifically solve the problem of processing orders; do a good job in construction organization design; conduct job testing according to technical standards; adjust labor according to regions and projects; mobilize employees to discuss construction plans; and generally check safety and health conditions. All competent departments and local party committees should, in conjunction with the struggle against bureaucracy, continue to conduct in-depth inspections of the preparation work, solve specific problems one by one, to ensure the commencement of construction according to the planned schedule.

    东北紧张进行基本建设准备工作
    三百多万平方公尺建筑面积下月开始施工
    【本报讯】东北全区基本建设准备工作已进入最紧张阶段，四月份可有三百万到三百五十万平方公尺建筑面积的工程开始施工。
    今年东北区基本建设规模很大，初步确定的基本建设工作总量比一九五二年增加了百分之八十四。其中有新型的近代化的钢铁厂、发电站、石油工厂、竖井、斜井、露天矿、重型机器厂等工程。为配合基本建设，全区城市建设投资达八千多亿元。
    去年八月，东北区就开始进行今年基本建设工程的准备工作。东北财政经济委员会在去年第四季度，对加强设计工作，整顿施工力量，固定与训练建筑工人，预拨储备材料和编制一九五三年基本建设计划，就作了一些筹划与规定。各个基本建设部门都总结了过去的经验教训，并紧张地进行了各项准备。各部门调配大批干部和技术工人充实机构，同时加强对基本建设的领导。根据电业、电器、有色金属等九个管理局的统计，三个月来共从生产部门中和其他方面调集了两万三千多人，充实了勘察设计和施工机构。全区建立了各种专业性的、综合性的工程公司和设计公司一百二十六个。
    各建设单位及时地集结和训练了施工力量。全区（包括中央各部在东北的工程公司）固定工人已有十六万七千人，其中技术工人占百分之七十。十二万多固定工人，从去年十二月起都参加了冬季训练，经过两个多月的政治教育，政治觉悟显著提高，目前正在进行技术学习。
    在勘察、设计工作方面，已有二十余项重工业建设的重点工程完成了设计。到二月底为止，中央重工业部设计公司已完成标准设计二十八种，其中有宿舍、中学、仓库、浴池等。初步计算，至少有二百万平方公尺以上的建筑面积可以采用这些标准设计，有十八万平方公尺以上的建筑面积可以使用旧设计图纸。各省市的设计力量比去年十一月增长了百分之八十三。很多部门在设计人员中检查了设计思想，着重批判了不负责任盲目设计的态度和资产阶级的技术观点，以及在设计中忽视技术保安和劳动保护等倾向，同时更进一步推广了苏联的先进设计经验。
    机械化施工的工作也积极作了准备。除重点工程已从国外订购了一批施工机械外，东北财政经济委员会在去年第四季度又为地方国营工业的建筑单位配备了一部分建筑机械，以供应施工需要，使高空及短距离运输、现场运搬、混凝土搅拌、排水压路等笨重操作，能逐步走向机械化作业。各施工单位也在积极检修已有的机械设备和训练运转工人。
    准备工作中的新困难是设备订货的问题。如鞍山钢铁公司和电业、有色金属管理局等单位，今年所需的钢铁设备，电气和钻探机械等，数量巨大，品种繁多。某些单位曾经因为领导关系改变，发生脱节的现象，目前，在按时交货及规格质量的保证上，还要十分注意。建筑材料的供应，从东北全区的情况来看基本上可以满足开工的需要，但是各单位准备情况极不平衡，有些单位储备的红砖、木材已足够全年之用；而另外一些单位因计划定得太晚，材料的准备和施工要求还相差很远；有的对材料的储备甚至还没有考虑，或没有人管材料工作，材料供应的计划更没有制订。因此，这是必须密切注意，迅速研究解决的问题。
    东北区今年基本建设的准备工作比去年有进步，但是还有下列一些思想问题和工作问题必须解决。
    目前，东北区基本建设部门最突出、最普遍的思想问题是等待依赖思想，甲方和乙方、上级和下级互相依赖等待，在一定程度上影响了准备工作的进行。某些部门因计划迟迟未定，在下面的干部中产生了埋怨的情绪。这是由于对国家开始进行大规模基本建设的具体情况和特点认识不足，即国家进入了经济建设的新时期，对建设的速度、质量要求都非常严格，但各方面的经验和主观力量不足，客观方面也有若干困难，因而发生了矛盾。在这种情况下，应该提倡发挥积极、主动克服困难的精神，反对各种消极的情绪和态度。
    影响准备工作的一些具体问题是：计划确定得太迟缓而且变动频繁；设计力量不足和设计水平较低，使设计迟缓而且不准确，同时由于地质资料的供给不及时、不准确，影响了国外设计的进度；材料、设备的管理还很乱，砖瓦砂石的质量较差，运输计划完成得不好，水暖器材、小五金的订货多半还未着手；劳动力的调配不平衡，特殊工种、技术人员还缺乏适当的调剂；财务工作还赶不上施工准备的需要，投资拨款迟缓，有些制度规定得不合理；各方面对基本建设的配合不够，有些地区和有些部门还没有行动起来全面地支援基本建设。
    因此，东北区各主管业务部门和基本建设单位必须发挥积极主动的精神，继续加紧准备工作：各级财委和主管业务部门应迅速进行工程排队，确定第一期开工的工程项目，并根据已排定的次序再做一次准备工作的检查；迅速组织有关方面会审设计图纸；具体解决加工订货问题；做好施工组织设计；按技术标准进行考工；按地区、按工程调整劳动力；发动职工讨论施工计划；并普遍检查一次安全、卫生情况。各主管部门、各地方党委应结合反官僚主义斗争，继续深入检查准备工作的情况，逐项解决具体问题，以确保按预订计划开工。
