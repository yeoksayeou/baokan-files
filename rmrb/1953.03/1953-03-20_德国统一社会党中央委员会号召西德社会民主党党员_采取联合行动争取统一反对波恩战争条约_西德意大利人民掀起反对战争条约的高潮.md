    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 19th (TASS dispatch from Berlin, March 16th): “Neues Deutschland” published on March 15th an open letter from the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, signed by Pieck, Grotewohl, and Ulbricht, to the members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany in West Germany. The letter calls on Social Democrats and Communists in West Germany to unite, jointly defend the rights of the working people of West Germany, oppose the Bonn war treaty, overthrow the Adenauer anti-people regime, and strive to restore Germany's unification and conclude a peace treaty with Germany.
      The letter points out that since 1945, the two parts of Germany, east and west, have embarked on two different paths. In the German Democratic Republic, the working people, headed by the working class, have come to power and begun the great historical task of building socialism in a planned way. However, in West Germany, monopoly capitalists and landlords have regained power, colluding with American imperialists, intensifying the destruction of all democratic rights and freedoms, and adopting open fascist rule.
    The open letter points out: The main enemies of the German people are bellicose American imperialism and its main pillar in Europe—revived German imperialism. In order to realize their anti-people policies, the imperialists have planted their lackeys and open spies among the working masses in all capitalist countries. Their spies and lackeys in West Germany are the right-wing leaders of the German Social Democratic Party and the West German Trade Union Federation.
    The open letter states: The leadership group of the German Social Democratic Party and the West German Trade Union Federation, which betrayed the people, is the main political capital of American and German imperialists in West Germany. If the deception of the right-wing leadership group of the Social Democratic Party and the West German Trade Union Federation is broken, the imperialists' militarist policy in Germany cannot be realized, and the road to a unified and truly democratic Germany will be unimpeded.
    The open letter puts forward four suggestions:
    1. All Social Democrats and Communists in local groups and parliamentary groups in various industrial institutions, states, and districts should immediately reach an agreement to restore the unity of the working-class movement.
    2. Social Democrats and Communists should jointly fight for higher wages, lower prices, opposition to the increasing tax burden, opposition to the reactionary laws concerning the status of workers in industrial institutions, and strive for the full right of trade unions to participate in the joint management of industrial institutions.
    3. Jointly and actively defend the democratic rights of all working people, oppose the terror rule of the Adenauer regime and the intensifying fascization.
    4. Oppose the Bonn war treaty, overthrow the Adenauer imperialist regime, establish a nationally unified government including appropriate representatives of the working class, and wage an uncompromising struggle to strive for the conclusion of a democratic peace treaty.
    Finally, the Socialist Unity Party invites the Social Democrats to send a delegation to the German Democratic Republic to study the achievements and policies of the working-class movement; the Socialist Unity Party also expresses its readiness to accept invitations from local and regional organizations of the Social Democratic Party to send delegations to West Germany to jointly discuss issues of common concern to everyone.
    According to Xinhua News Agency: Because Adenauer, with the support of the West German Constitutional Court, decided to have the Bonn Federal Parliament pass the Bonn and Paris war treaties in a third reading on March 19 and 20, the patriotic people of West Germany are launching a new wave of opposition to the Bonn and Paris war treaties.
    A delegation from the Berlin International Conference for a Peaceful Settlement of the German Question visited the presidiums of the West German Federal Parliament and the Federal Senate on March 12, and handed them the statement made by the German representatives at the Berlin Conference in November 1952. The delegation also handed a letter signed by Dr. Nicholas Koch, one of the secretaries of the conference, to all members of the Federal Parliament. Koch called on the parliamentarians to oppose the "suicidal and humiliating Western treaty" and support the efforts to rebuild a peaceful and unified Germany. The Council of the "German United Movement" held a special meeting on March 12, and issued a statement after the meeting, calling on the German people to hold mass rallies, demonstrations, send delegations and submit protest letters to prevent the realization of the Bonn and Paris war treaties. The statement was signed by former German Imperial Chancellor Wirth, former Mayor Elvers, and a total of ninety people. Many of them are people who had no connection with the movement in the past. The Council wrote to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, requesting that a Four-Power Conference with the participation of representatives from East and West Germany be held quickly.
    The European Workers' Committee Against the Remilitarization of Germany issued a statement calling on all German people to do everything possible to smash the plan to ratify the Bonn and Paris war treaties, raise the banner of national resistance, overthrow the Adenauer traitorous regime, and strive for the unification of Germany.
    Representatives of German, French, and Italian former soldiers and war victims associations gathered on the 14th and 15th and unanimously adopted a resolution opposing the ratification of the Bonn and Paris treaties, demanding a Four-Power Conference, and reunifying Germany. Workers and mass organizations from Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia and other states and many large industrial cities in West Germany have been sending delegations to Bonn in an endless stream, asking to see members of the Federal Parliament and demanding that they prevent the ratification of the Bonn and Paris war treaties.
    According to Xinhua News Agency: Countless rallies and demonstrations have been held throughout Italy to protest the organization of the aggressive "European Army." Mass meetings and various gatherings organized by the working people of Turin passed resolutions protesting the ratification of the Paris war treaty, which stipulates the organization of a "European Army." These resolutions have been handed over to the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The same gatherings were held in the city of Alessandria and several towns in the province of Alessandria, as well as in the provinces of Pisa, Siena, and Pistoia. In Susalla, in the province of Mantua, peace fighters launched a demonstration protesting the organization of the "European Army." Former guerrillas, veterans, disabled veterans, and reserve officers participated in the demonstration.

    德国统一社会党中央委员会号召西德社会民主党党员
    采取联合行动争取统一反对波恩战争条约
    西德意大利人民掀起反对战争条约的高潮
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社柏林十六日讯：“新德意志报”三月十五日刊载了一封由皮克、格罗提渥和乌布利希署名的德国统一社会党中央委员会给西德的德国社会民主党党员的公开信，号召社会民主党人和西德的共产党人团结起来，共同保卫西德劳动人民的权利、反对波恩战争条约、推翻阿登纳反人民的政权，争取恢复德国的统一与缔结对德和约。
      信中指出，自一九四五年以来，德国东西两部分已走上两种不同的道路。在德意志民主共和国，以工人阶级为首的劳动人民已经当政，并开始了进行有计划地建设社会主义的伟大历史任务；但是，在西德，垄断资本家和大地主已经重新当政，他们勾结美帝国主义者，正在加紧破坏一切民主权利和自由，并且采取公开的法西斯统治手段。
    公开信指出：德国人民的主要敌人是好战的美帝国主义和它在欧洲的主要支柱——复活的德国帝国主义。帝国主义者为了要实现他们反人民的政策，就在一切资本主义国家的劳动群众中安插下他们的走狗与公开的特务。他们在西德的特务与走狗就是德国社会民主党与西德工会联合会的右翼领袖们。
    公开信说：德国社会民主党与西德工会联合会叛卖人民的领导集团是美国与德国帝国主义者在西德的主要政治资本。如果社会民主党与西德工会联合会的右翼领导集团的骗局被击破，帝国主义者在德国的军国主义政策就不能实现，通往统一的与真正民主的德国的大道就畅通无阻了。
    公开信提出了四点建议：
    一、各工业机构、各州、各区的地方集团与议会所有集团中的一切社会民主党人与共产党人立即取得协议，恢复工人阶级行动的统一。
    二、社会民主党人与共产党人共同为要求提高工资、减低物价、反对日益增加的赋税负担、反对关于工业机构中工人地位的反动法律、争取工会参加共同管理工业机构的全部权利而斗争。
    三、共同积极保卫全体劳动人民的民主权利，反对阿登纳政权的恐怖统治与日益加紧的法西斯化。
    四、反对波恩战争条约，推翻阿登纳帝国主义政权，建立包括工人阶级的适当代表的全国统一的政府，为争取缔结民主的和约而进行不妥协的斗争。
    统一社会党最后邀请社会民主党人派遣代表团到德意志民主共和国来研究工人阶级运动的成就与政策；统一社会党并表示随时准备接受社会民主党地方及区域组织的邀请，派遣代表团到西德去共同讨论和大家都有关的问题。
    据新华社讯：由于阿登纳在西德宪法法院的支持下，决定在三月十九日和二十日使波恩联邦议院三读通过波恩和巴黎战争条约，西德爱国人民正掀起反对波恩和巴黎战争条约的新的浪潮。
    柏林国际争取和平解决德国问题会议的一个代表团在三月十二日访问了西德联邦议院和联邦参议院的主席团，把一九五二年十一月柏林会议上德国代表们所作的声明交给了他们。这个代表团并且把一封由会议的书记之一尼可拉斯·柯赫博士署名的致联邦议院全体议员的信件交给了他们。柯赫呼吁议员们反对“自杀性的、屈辱的西方条约”，支持重建和平统一的德国的努力。“德意志联合运动”理事会在三月十二日举行特别会议，会后发表声明，号召德国人民用举行群众集会、游行示威、派遣代表团和提出抗议书的方式来阻止波恩和巴黎战争条约实现。在声明上签字的有前德意志帝国总理维尔特、前市长艾尔费斯等共九十人。其中有许多人是过去和这个运动完全没有联系的人士。理事会写信给苏、美、英、法四国政府，要求迅速举行由东西德代表参加的四大国会议。
    欧洲工人反对德国重新军国主义化委员会发表声明，号召全体德国人民尽一切力量粉碎批准波恩和
    巴黎战争条约的计划，举起民族抵抗的大旗，推翻阿登纳卖国政权，争取德国的统一。
    德、法、意前士兵及战争受害者协会的代表十四、十五日集会，一致通过决议，反对批准波恩和巴黎条约，要求举行四大国会议，重新统一德国。西德巴伐利亚、巴登、瓦登堡、北莱因—威斯特伐利亚等州和其他各州及许多大工业城市中的工人和群众团体源源不绝地派遣代表团到波恩，请见联邦议院的议员，要求他们阻止批准波恩和巴黎战争条约。
    据新华社讯：意大利全国举行了无数次集会和示威游行，抗议组织侵略性的“欧洲军”。都灵劳动人民所组织的群众大会和各种集会通过了决议，抗议批准规定要组织“欧洲军”的巴黎战争条约。这些决议已经交给意大利政府外交部。亚历山德里亚市和亚历山德里亚省的几个城镇以及彼萨省、西埃那省和皮斯托雅省，都举行了同样的集会。在孟都亚省的苏萨拉，和平战士们发动了抗议组织“欧洲军”的示威游行。前游击队员、退伍军人、残废军人和后备队的军官，都参加了这次示威游行。
