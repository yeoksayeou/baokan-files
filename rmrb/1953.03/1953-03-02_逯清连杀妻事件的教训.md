    Lessons from the Lü Qinglian Wife-Killing Incident

    In the case of Lü Qinglian killing his wife in Shizhuang Village, Huojia County, we should draw two important lessons. The first lesson is that mediation in divorce cases should not be endless or coercive. The "mediation" step stipulated in Chapter 5 of the Marriage Law is only to prevent hasty divorces under momentary emotional impulses and to prevent both men and women from suffering greater misfortune due to rash divorces. Chapter 5 of the Marriage Law also stipulates: "If one party, male or female, insists on divorce, divorce shall also be granted if mediation by the district people's government and judicial organs is ineffective." This is to prevent coercive and endless mediation. However, many of our cadres have not correctly understood and implemented this provision of the Marriage Law. Starting from the traditional concepts of feudal ethics, they fundamentally oppose divorce and even more so oppose women's demands for divorce. They use "mediation" as a weapon against freedom of marriage. Regardless of whether the woman who proposes divorce has the possibility of continuing to live with her husband, they always mediate. When repeated mediation is ineffective, they delay it, leading to unfortunate incidents. Too many tragic deaths of women caused by forced mediation and endless mediation have occurred in the past! It should definitely not be repeated in the future!

    The second lesson is that in implementing the Marriage Law, we must first emphasize "ensuring that no one dies because of marriage issues." Therefore, clear responsibilities must be stipulated for cadres (especially grassroots cadres). The State Council of the Central People's Government's instructions on inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law in September 1951 stipulated: "In the future, if a woman is killed or commits suicide because she does not receive the rights and protection granted by the Marriage Law due to marriage issues, the main cadres at the district, township (village), and street levels shall bear certain responsibilities first." However, many cadres have not assumed this responsibility. In the Chen Yunlan murder case, the village cadres should have obviously and without hesitation broken down the door and entered to stop Lü from committing the crime. But they repeatedly went to the district to ask for instructions, unwilling or afraid to take action themselves to save the person. In the district, they happened to encounter bureaucratic elements Shang Fengtian and An Xilong who were indifferent to women's lives, and this woman's life was finally delayed! What is particularly intolerable is Lü Qinggui, the secretary of the Shizhuang Village branch. He was completely indifferent to the act of harming women; he neither stopped Lü Qinglian from committing the crime, nor did he allow others to break the window to rescue her, insisting on waiting for Lü to kill his wife! For cadres, this is a serious criminal act! The Huojia County People's Government's sentencing of Lü Qinggui to imprisonment is completely correct. If similar things happen in the future, they should be handled in the same way!

### 逯清连杀妻事件的教训

    逯清连杀妻事件的教训
    在获嘉县师庄村逯清连杀妻的事件中，我们应该吸取两个重要的教训。第一个教训，是对离婚案件的调解不能是无止境的和强制的。婚姻法第五章中规定的“调解”步骤，只是为了防止一时感情冲动之下的轻率离婚，防止男女双方因轻率离婚而遭致更大的不幸。婚姻法第五章同时规定：“男女一方坚决要求离婚的，经区人民政府和司法机关调解无效时，亦准予离婚。”就是为了防止强制的和无止境的调解。但是，我们有许多干部却并没有正确了解和执行婚姻法这个规定。他们从封建旧礼教的传统观念出发，根本反对离婚，更反对妇女提出离婚要求。他们把“调解”当成反对婚姻自由的武器，不管提出离婚的妇女是否与丈夫有继续共同生活的可能，总是一直调解。再三调解无效时，就拖延下去，以至发生不幸的事件。这种因强制调解和无止境调解而造成的妇女死亡的惨剧，过去已经发生得太多了！今后绝对不应该再重复了！
    第二个教训，是在贯彻执行婚姻法中，必须首先强调“保证不因婚姻问题而死人”。因此必须对干部（首先是基层干部）规定明确的责任。一九五一年九月中央人民政府政务院关于检查婚姻法执行情况的指示中规定：“今后如有妇女因婚姻问题得不到婚姻法所赋予的权利与保护而被杀或自杀者，区、乡（村）街级的主要干部，首先应负一定责任。”但是，有很多干部并没有负起这种责任。在陈运兰被杀事件中，村干部显然应当毫不犹豫地打门破窗而入，制止逯犯行凶。但他们却一再去区请示，不肯或不敢自己动手去救人。在区里，又恰恰碰上对妇女生命漠不关心的官僚主义分子尚风田和安喜龙，这个妇女的生命就终于被耽搁了！特别不能容忍的是师庄村支部书记逯清贵。他对残害妇女的行为完全无动于衷；既不制止逯清连行凶，也不允许别人破窗抢救，硬要坐待逯犯将妻杀死！对于干部来说，这是严重的犯罪行为！获嘉县人民政府判处逯清贵徒刑是完全正确的。今后如有类似的事情发生，也应该这样办！
