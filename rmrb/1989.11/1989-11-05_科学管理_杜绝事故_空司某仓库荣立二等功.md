The warehouse of the Air Force Communications Equipment Department has maintained comprehensive safety for 40 years since its establishment in 1949 by continuously improving various management systems. Recently, the warehouse was awarded a collective second-class merit by the Air Force Party Committee.

The warehouse has focused on improving the ideological awareness, professional skills, and management level of its personnel. The warehouse leadership holds nearly 100 conversations with officers and soldiers each year to help them resolve ideological issues. The current political commissar, Shi Fugu, has been in his position for six years. During this time, he has spent three Spring Festivals in distant sub-warehouses with the soldiers on duty and patrol, and most holidays he has taken the place of the soldiers to stand guard and watch the telephone. Strong political work and the establishment of a safety responsibility system, among other practical measures, have instilled in the personnel a sense of ownership and responsibility for the warehouse. Every year, nearly 100 soldiers are sent out to escort materials, and they have all completed their missions successfully.

    科学管理　杜绝事故
    空司某仓库荣立二等功
    本报讯　空军司令部通信器材仓库自1949年建库以来，不断健全各项管理制度，40年全面安全。最近，经空军党委批准，该仓库荣立集体二等功。
    这个仓库着力提高官兵的思想觉悟、业务素质和管理水平。仓库领导每年找干部战士谈心近百人次，帮助他们解决思想问题。现任政委史富贵，任职6年，有3个春节是在远离北京的分库和官兵一起值班、巡逻，大多数节假日都代替战士站岗、守电话。强有力的政治工作和建立安全责任制等切实措施，使官兵树立起以库为家的主人翁思想。每年近百名战士外出押运物资，都圆满完成了任务。　　　（刘绍文　孟庆彬）
