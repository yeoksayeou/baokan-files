Yang Baibing, Secretary of the Central Military Commission and Director of the General Political Department, today met with members of the Chengdu Military Region's Youth Reading and Lecture Team. He said that reading and lecturing activities are an excellent form of ideological and political work. They guide cadres and soldiers to read more and read good books, resist the influence of bourgeois liberalization and other erroneous thoughts, and promote the construction of socialist spiritual and material civilization.

The Chengdu Military Region's Youth Reading and Lecture Team was established in early October this year, with an average age of 25. Their lectures, themed "Love the Party, Love the Country, Love the Army," fully reflect the correct political direction, selfless dedication, hard work, and good style of the broad masses of officers and soldiers in the army after suppressing the turmoil and quelling the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Yang Baibing praised their lectures for being closely linked to reality, having good forms, good content, and good effects. He also happily presented the team members with books such as "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping."

Today, the eight members of the lecture team gave a lecture for the General Political Department.

    据新华社北京11月25日电  （记者罗玉文）中央军委秘书长、总政治部主任杨白冰今天在会见成都军区青年读书演讲团的同志时说，读书演讲活动是政治思想工作一种很好的形式，对于引导干部战士多读书、读好书，抵制资产阶级自由化和其他错误思想的影响，促进社会主义精神文明和物质文明建设，都将起到很好的促进作用。
    成都军区青年读书演讲团是今年10月初组建的，平均年龄25岁。他们的演讲以“爱党爱国爱军”为主题，充分反映了在制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱后，部队广大官兵坚持正确的政治方向、无私奉献的革命情操、艰苦奋斗的优良作风和朝气蓬勃的精神风貌。杨白冰称赞他们的演讲结合实际很紧，形式好、内容好、效果好，还高兴地向演讲团的同志赠送了《邓小平文选》等书籍。
    演讲团的8名成员今天为总政机关举行了演讲。
