    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 2nd — General Secretary of the Czechoslovakian Communist Party (CPCz) Milos Jakes and President of the Republic Gustav Husak met with Vice Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Xu Xin in Prague on the 2nd. Both sides had a friendly and cordial conversation.

    Jakes believed that the visit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army friendship delegation led by Xu Xin would help deepen mutual understanding. He hoped to further develop relations between the two parties and the two countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. He reiterated support for the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and government aimed at defending Chinese socialism and maintaining world peace, and emphasized that Czechoslovakia, in the current complex international situation, would continue to explore its path of socio-economic development according to its own conditions.

    Husak expressed admiration for the highly principled and realistic policies China has pursued in its socialist construction. He said that Czechoslovakia highly values its relationship with China and is willing to further develop comprehensive cooperation with China.

    Both leaders asked Xu Xin to convey their greetings to Chinese leaders Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Yang Shangkun, and Li Peng.

    Xu Xin and his delegation arrived in Czechoslovakia from the German Democratic Republic on October 28th. They met with Czechoslovakian Minister of Defense Vatslavik and Chief of the General Staff of the Czechoslovakian People's Army Vacek, visited the Czechoslovakian-Chinese Friendship Association, and inspected other military facilities.
