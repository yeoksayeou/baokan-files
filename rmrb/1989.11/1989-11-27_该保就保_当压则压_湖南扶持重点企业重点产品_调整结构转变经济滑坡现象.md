    The People's Daily, Changsha, November 26th - Reporter Wu Xinghua reports: Hunan Province has taken measures to adjust the structure of industrial products and enterprises, gradually reversing the decline in production of key enterprises and key products. From January to October, the province's total industrial output value increased by 5.1% compared to the same period last year, and the profit and tax revenue of budgetary enterprises increased by 7.7%.

    Due to various reasons, in the first quarter of this year, Hunan Province's total industrial output value decreased by 0.3% compared to the same period last year. Among them, the output value of central and provincial enterprises decreased by 8.8% and 2.5%, respectively. To reverse this situation, the provincial government has implemented the "five supports and five controls" measures: supporting energy and raw material products, supporting agricultural support products, supporting high-quality and famous brand products in the light industry, supporting daily necessities and small commodities, and supporting deep processing and high-value-added export products; controlling high-energy-consuming products, controlling backlogged and unsold products, controlling technologically backward products, controlling low-quality products, and controlling the export of raw materials.

    At the same time, the provincial government has identified 130 key enterprises that have suitable products, large production volumes, and high profits and taxes as the focus of support and protection. The provincial and municipal governments have allocated electricity quotas and ensured the supply of raw materials. When the supply of cotton to light textile enterprises was tight, the province specially organized a cotton coordination group to transport cotton from cotton-producing areas. The province also organized a coal transportation coordination group to help key enterprises transport coal. From January to September, the province added 350 million yuan in working capital loans for industrial enterprises, of which 340 million yuan were used for the production of key enterprises.

    该保就保　当压则压
　　湖南扶持重点企业重点产品
　　调整结构转变经济滑坡现象
    本报长沙11月26日电　记者吴兴华报道：湖南省采取措施调整工业产品和企业结构，逐步扭转重点企业和重点产品生产一度滑坡的局面。1至10月，全省工业总产值比去年同期增长5.1％，预算内企业实现利税增长7.7％。
    由于多方面的原因，今年第一季度与去年同期相比，湖南全省工业总产值下降0.3％，其中，中央部属企业下降8.8％，省属企业下降2.5％。为扭转这一局面，省政府采取了“五保五压”的措施：保能源和原材料产品，保支农产品，保轻纺机电优质名牌产品，保日用工业必需品和小商品，保深度加工和高附加值的出口创汇产品；压高耗能产品，压滞销积压产品，压技术落后产品，压质量差的产品，压原材料出口。
    与此同时，省政府确定产品适销对路、产量大、利税多的130家骨干企业，作为扶持、保证重点。省、地“戴帽”下达电力指标，千方百计保证原材料供应。轻纺企业棉花供应紧张，省里专门组织了棉花协调小组到产棉区调运。省里还组织了煤炭运输协调小组，帮助重点企业调运煤炭。1至9月，全省新增工业企业流动资金贷款3.5亿元，其中3.4亿元用于重点企业生产。
