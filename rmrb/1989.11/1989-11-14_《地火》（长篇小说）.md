	Author: Wang Xiaoxin, Published by the Liberation Army Literature and Arts Publishing House

	In the contemporary era, as the wave of rural economic reform sweeps across the country, Qin Xin, a young cadre with a background in economics who was once labeled a "running dog" during the Cultural Revolution, returns to his hometown of Qinqiao Town to serve as the town's mayor. He hopes to lead the town's residents in steering this economically stagnant town towards the path of reform and opening up.

	However, what awaits this young man?

	Various companies, relying on loans from the Agricultural Bank, are engaged in commerce, seemingly thriving, but in reality, these are people blinded by the commercial fervor, causing more harm than good. Meanwhile, diligent professional households struggle with a lack of education and information, leading to bankruptcy and an inability to repay bank loans, facing dire straits. Small farmers and merchants, accustomed to a natural economy, are bewildered and resistant to the influx of outsiders, leading to sharp conflicts. The long-standing smallholder mentality of conservatism, stubbornness, and narrow-mindedness causes those who benefited from the land reforms, and who once shared the spoils of victory with this young mayor's family, to ally with the old landlord, the former mayor of Qinqiao Town, and the president of the fake Chamber of Commerce, becoming obstacles to the reform tide.

	The author, with a cold, realistic pen, depicts the impact of economic reform on traditional forces and the cleansing of feudal clan forces and nostalgia bred by rural natural economies. The novel showcases the deep and severe barriers, both tangible and intangible, that stand in the way of moving from closed old customs to the broad path of reform. It also highlights the majestic spirit of the Communist Party members, represented by Qin Xin, who adapt to the times and strive to revitalize the rural economy.

	The novel delves into the contradictions of reform, the dilemmas and struggles of reformers, not merely from the usual angles of power and system, but from the various mentalities of different people, especially linking today's reform process in Qinqiao Town with history. This gives the work a rich historical perspective. The protagonist's use of economic theory to think about life indicates the author's artistic exploration of this reform, imbuing the novel with a radiant intellectual light.

	As people reflect on this ongoing economic reform, they express respect for those writers who have genuinely and deeply explored the path of our nation's development. They also applaud those who strive to portray this movement truthfully from new angles. (Zhái Biān)

    《地火》（长篇小说）
    作者　王晓新　解放军文艺社出版
    在农村经济改革大潮席卷神州的当代，“文革”中曾被视为“狗崽子”、具有经济学专业知识的青年干部秦欣，回到了故乡秦桥镇任镇长。他希望能带领全镇群众将这个经济长期停滞不前的镇子引向改革、开放的大道。
    然而，等待这位年轻人的，又是什么呢？
    五花八门的公司靠借农业银行的贷款做生意，可谓“欣欣向荣”，却是一些被经商热潮冲昏了头脑的人们瞎折腾，成事不足，败事有余；而一些勤勤恳恳的专业户又苦于缺少文化和信息闭塞，一旦破产则无法偿还银行的贷款，面临绝境；长期习惯于自然经济的小农小商们面对大批拥进的外来经商户，由疑惑不解到迷茫抵触，以致爆发尖锐的冲突；长期以来小农意识形成的守旧固执偏狭使那些当年土改的翻身户、曾从这位年轻镇长的老家分走胜利果实的人们，在新的经济潮流冲击下，竟同年轻镇长的父亲——当年的老地主、秦桥镇的老镇长、伪商会会长，结盟成为改革洪流的障碍。
    作者以冷峻写实的笔触描绘了经济改革对于传统势力的冲击，对于农村自然经济滋生的封建宗法势力和恋旧情绪的涤荡。小说展示了从封闭的旧俗风习中迈向改革广阔大道上，各种经济的政治的文化心态以及各种有形与无形的精神屏障，是多么的深重和严厉，同时也反衬了顺应时代潮流，振兴农村经济的以秦欣为代表的共产党人豪迈正气。
    小说写改革中的矛盾、写改革者的困惑和奋进，不从习见的同类题材多是在权力、体制方面展示，而从不同人们的各种心态，尤其把今天的改革进程中秦桥镇人们的思想行为同历史勾连起来，使作品表现出丰富的历史感。作品的主人公用经济理论思考生活，表明作者对这场改革的艺术探求，使小说透出思想的光彩。
    当人们回首这段仍在深入的经济改革生活时，对那些真切而深刻地探索我们民族发展之路的作家们表示敬意，也为那些力图从新的角度为这场运动写真的作品拍手欢欣。（翟边）
