The Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party pointed out that continuing to firmly implement the policies of rectification and deepening reform is the fundamental way to overcome the current economic difficulties and achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy. One of the goals of rectification is to further deepen and improve various reform measures, gradually establishing a macro-control system that combines planned economy with market regulation, and comprehensively utilizes economic, administrative, and legal means. Therefore, it is important to theoretically elucidate the relationship between planned economy and market regulation, and to correctly solve the issues of the degree, methods, and scope of combining planned economy with market regulation in practice.

Planned economy is a fundamental characteristic of the socialist economy, and it is fundamentally opposed to the market economy. The so-called market economy is based on private ownership, where the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of society are self-regulated by an "invisible hand" — the market — resulting in the economy operating in a state of anarchy. Planned economy, on the other hand, is based on public ownership, where the state can use economic, administrative, and legal means to consciously regulate the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of society, thus ensuring that the economy develops in a planned and proportional manner. Socialist society cannot implement a market economy but must implement a planned economy, which is determined by the nature of the socialist economy. Theoretically, the planned and proportional development of the economy is an objective requirement of socialized large-scale production. However, this does not mean that the economy can automatically achieve planning just because it is socialized large-scale production. Capitalist economies are also socialized large-scale production, but due to the fundamental contradiction between the socialization of production and the private ownership of the means of production, it is impossible to achieve economic planning across the entire society. Instead, it relies on the blind forces of the market and periodic economic crises to forcibly balance social production with social needs, resulting in a huge waste of human, material, and financial resources. The economic foundation of socialist society is public ownership of the means of production, where the fundamental contradiction inherent in capitalist economies no longer exists. Therefore, it is possible to consciously implement the planned and proportional development of the national economy on a macro level, maximizing the conservation of social labor and improving the efficiency of economic activities.

In China, the implementation of a planned economy is fundamentally different from the economic planning interventions of Western countries. Although Western countries can influence microeconomic activities to a certain extent and within a certain scope through economic planning, overall, the economy is still self-regulated by the laws of value and market supply and demand. The entire economy cannot be in a state of orderly development. In China, the implementation of a planned economy is not just a matter of the state intervening in social economic activities, but rather how to make social economic activities operate according to planned goals. The state must make prior plans for economic growth rates, industrial structure, income distribution, price levels, international payments, and use economic, administrative, and legal means to achieve these goals.

During China's economic reform process, due to the spread of bourgeois liberalization, there emerged erroneous proposals to completely deny the socialist planned economy and replace it with a market economy. This is essentially a denial of China's fundamental socialist economic system. The path taken by socialist countries in economic reform has proven that if the planned economy is not adhered to and a market economy is implemented, the state will inevitably find it difficult to control social economic activities. This will not only shake the economic foundation of socialism, which is public ownership, but also shake the political system of socialism, gradually transforming socialist countries into capitalist countries. This is precisely what Western countries hope for.

Planned economy and market economy are fundamentally opposed, but this does not mean that planned economy and market regulation are incompatible. Because market, market regulation, and market economy are concepts with different connotations and cannot be confused. Before the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, we implemented a highly centralized economic system and planning system. This system opposed planned economy and commodity economy, excluded the regulatory role of the market, and over-controlled and over-regulated economic activities, seriously hindering the development of social productive forces. Therefore, we must follow the theory of socialist planned commodity economy and carry out economic system reforms. However, there are significant differences in the understanding of this theory. Our Party timely summarized the experience of ten years of reform and clearly pointed out that China's economic system reform is the self-improvement of the socialist economic system. It also proposed the scientific proposition of combining planned economy with market regulation, pointing the way for deepening the reform. The reason why China must implement the combination of planned economy and market regulation is fundamentally due to the fact that the socialist economy is a planned commodity economy based on public ownership. On the basis of public ownership, especially the dominant state-owned economy, the overall interests of society are generated, enabling the state to act as the social regulation center. Through economic planning, it coordinates macroeconomic and microeconomic activities, allowing enterprises to pursue their own interests while increasing the overall interests of society, thus achieving the planned and proportional development of the national economy. However, since the socialist economy is also a commodity economy, the individual labor of enterprises can only be recognized by society through commodity exchange. Therefore, the operation of the socialist economy must rely on market regulation and must attach importance to and give play to the role of the law of value. In the situation where the public ownership economy is dominant, the law of value is no longer a blind and alien force controlling people. We can consciously recognize and use the law of value on a societal scale, giving play to the positive role of market regulation and promoting the coordinated development of the national economy.

The combination of planned economy and market regulation is an economic operation model that adapts to the requirements of planned commodity economy. However, planned economy and market regulation are not at the same level. In China's economic operation, planning plays a guiding role, and the play of market regulation cannot deviate from the planning goals. However, it should also be noted that China's planned economy is a planned economy under commodity economy conditions. The defects of the market can be corrected through planning, but the realization of planning goals cannot be separated from the play of market functions. Therefore, the combination of planned economy and market regulation is not purely a block-like state but is largely in an intertwined state. This requires us to continuously adjust the combination of the two according to the progress of development and reform.

The combination of planned economy and market regulation only proposes the basic framework of the operation mechanism of socialist planned commodity economy, but does not specify the degree, methods, and scope of the combination of planned economy and market regulation. We can only explore this step by step based on national conditions during the process of development and reform. The socialist system itself is still in the process of continuous development and improvement. At different times, due to different levels of development of productive forces, different degrees of maturity of commodity economy and market, different tasks of economic development, different specific goals of macroeconomic regulation, and different levels of planning work, the degree, scope, and methods of the combination of planned economy and market regulation will also be different. We can only start from the actual situation of each period, make the best choice on the basis of fully recognizing and respecting objective economic laws, and adopt different methods of mandatory planning, guiding planning, and market regulation for economic activities of different levels, types, and fields. We should also timely adjust the scope and strength of planning regulation and market regulation.

The Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee pointed out that it will take three years or a little longer to complete the task of rectification. Given that in recent years, the role of market regulation has been exaggerated, leading to a significant weakening of the planned economy, it is an objective requirement to re-study and delineate the scope of mandatory planning, guiding planning, and market regulation to achieve the goals of rectification. During the period of rectification, the scope of mandatory planning should be appropriately expanded, firmly establishing the idea of the national chessboard and resolutely opposing decentralization to ensure the implementation of the national plan. For example, for important products that are related to the national economy and people's livelihood but are in short supply, mandatory planning should play a greater role in production and distribution; to ease the contradiction between total social demand and total supply and to control inflation, the policy of tightening fiscal and credit should be continued, controlling the scale of fixed asset investment and the growth rate of consumption funds; to enhance the state's macro-control capability, the proportion of fiscal revenue in national income and the proportion of central fiscal revenue in the total fiscal revenue should be appropriately increased; while continuing to compress total demand, efforts should be made to adjust the industrial structure to increase effective supply and enhance the momentum of economic development. Of course, while strengthening the planned nature of the economy, efforts should also be made to improve the level of planning work, improve and perfect the management methods of planning according to the requirements of combining planned economy with market regulation, and more effectively give play to the role of market regulation on the basis of rectifying market order.

### 建立计划经济与市场调节相结合的运行机制

　　建立计划经济与市场调节相结合的运行机制
　　胡乃武　袁振宇
    党的十三届五中全会指出，继续坚定不移地执行治理整顿和深化改革的方针，是克服当前经济困难，实现国民经济持续、稳定、协调发展的根本途径。而治理整顿的目标之一，就是要进一步深化和完善各项改革措施，逐步建立符合计划经济与市场调节相结合原则的，经济、行政、法律手段综合运用的宏观调控体系。因此，从理论上阐明计划经济与市场调节的关系，在实践中正确解决计划经济与市场调节相结合的程度、方式和范围，就有重要的意义。
    计划经济是社会主义经济的一个基本特征，它与市场经济是根本对立的。所谓市场经济，是以私有制为基础，社会的生产、分配、交换和消费是由一只“看不见的手”即市场来自发调节，从而社会经济是在无政府状态下运行的。计划经济是以公有制为基础，国家能够运用经济的、行政的和法律的手段，对社会的生产、分配、交换和消费进行自觉的调节，因而经济是有计划按比例发展的。社会主义社会不可能实行市场经济而只能实行计划经济，这是由社会主义经济的本质决定的。从理论上说，经济的有计划按比例发展是社会化大生产的客观要求，但并不意味着只要是社会化大生产就能自动地实现经济的计划化。资本主义经济也是社会化的大生产，但由于生产的社会化与生产资料私人占有这一基本矛盾的存在，因而不可能在全社会范围内实现经济的计划化，只能通过盲目的市场力量，通过周期性的经济危机，强制地实现社会生产与社会需要的平衡，并造成人力、物力、财力的巨大浪费。社会主义社会的经济基础是生产资料公有制，在这里资本主义经济所固有的基本矛盾已不复存在，从而能在总体上自觉地实行有计划按比例地发展国民经济，最大限度地节约社会劳动，提高经济活动的效益。
    在我国实行计划经济，与西方国家通过经济计划干预经济活动是有本质区别的。尽管西方国家通过经济计划也能在一定程度、一定范围内影响微观经济主体的活动，但从总体上看，仍然是由价值规律和市场供求规律自发调节的，整个经济不可能处于有序发展的状态。而在我国实行计划经济，并非是一般的国家对社会经济活动进行干预的问题，而是如何使社会经济活动按计划目标运行的问题。国家对经济增长率、产业结构、收入分配、物价水平、国际收支等，都要预先作出计划安排，并运用经济的、行政的、法律的手段来加以实现。
    在我国经济改革过程中，由于资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥，出现了全盘否定社会主义计划经济，而代之以市场经济的错误主张。这实际上是要从根本上否定我国社会主义基本经济制度。社会主义国家进行经济改革所走过的道路已经证明，如不坚持计划经济而实行市场经济那一套，国家对社会经济活动势必难以控制，这不仅会动摇社会主义的经济基础即公有制，而且会动摇社会主义的政治制度，把社会主义国家逐步演变为资本主义国家。而这正是西方国家所希望的。
    计划经济与市场经济是根本对立的，但这绝不是说计划经济与市场调节也是水火不相容的。因为市场、市场调节、市场经济是内涵不同的概念，不能把它们混为一谈。党的十一届三中全会以前，我们实行的是高度集中的经济体制和计划体制，这种体制把计划经济和商品经济对立起来，排斥市场的调节作用，国家对经济活动统得过多，管得过死，严重地阻碍了社会生产力的发展。因此，我们必须遵循社会主义有计划商品经济理论，进行经济体制的改革。但人们在对这一理论的理解上，却存在较大的分歧。我们党及时总结了十年改革的经验，明确指出，我国的经济体制改革，是社会主义经济制度的自我完善。并且提出了计划经济与市场调节相结合的科学论断，为深化改革指明了方向。在我国之所以要实行计划经济与市场调节相结合，从根本上说，是由于社会主义经济是建立在公有制基础上的有计划的商品经济。在公有制特别是占主导地位的全民所有制的基础上，产生了社会的整体利益，使国家能够作为社会调节中心，通过经济计划，协调宏观经济和微观经济活动，使企业在增进社会整体利益的前提下，去追求自己的特殊利益，从而实现国民经济的有计划按比例发展。但由于社会主义经济也是商品经济，企业的个别劳动要通过商品交换才能得到社会的承认。因而，社会主义经济的运行就必须借助于市场调节，必须重视和发挥价值规律的作用。但在公有制经济占主体地位的情况下，价值规律已不再是支配人们的盲目的异己的力量，我们能够在全社会的规模上去自觉地认识和运用价值规律，发挥市场调节的积极作用，促进国民经济的协调发展。
    计划经济与市场调节相结合，这是适应有计划商品经济要求的经济运行模式。但计划经济与市场调节这两者并非属于同
  一层次。在我国的经济运行中，计划是起导向作用的，市场调节作用的发挥不能偏离计划的目标。但也要看到，我国的计划经济是商品经济条件下的计划经济，市场的缺陷固然可以通过计划予以纠正，而计划目标的实现又不能离开市场功能的发挥。因此，计划经济和市场调节的结合又不单纯是板块式的，在很大程度上是处于一种交织的状态。这就要求我们根据发展与改革的进程，不断地调整两者的结合关系。
    计划经济与市场调节相结合，只是提出了社会主义有计划商品经济运行机制的基本框架，而并没有规定计划经济与市场调节相结合的程度、方式和范围。我们只能从国情出发，在发展和改革的过程中逐步探索。社会主义制度本身还处在不断发展和完善的过程中。在不同时期，由于生产力发展水平不同，商品经济和市场发育成熟程度不同，经济发展的任务不同，宏观经济调控的具体目标不同，以及计划工作水平不同，计划经济与市场调节相结合在程度、范围和方式上也会有所不同。我们只能从各个时期的实际出发，在充分认识和尊重客观经济规律的基础上，作出最佳的选择，对不同层次、不同类型和不同领域的经济活动，采取指令性计划、指导性计划和市场调节的不同方法，并对计划调节与市场调节各自的范围和力度适时地作出调整。
    党的十三届五中全会指出，要用三年或者更长一点的时间完成治理整顿的任务。鉴于前些年由于不切实际地夸大了市场调节作用，使计划经济受到很大削弱，所以重新研究和划分指令性计划、指导性计划和市场调节的范围，已成为完成治理整顿目标的客观要求。在治理整顿期间，要适当扩大指令性计划的范围，牢固树立全国一盘棋思想、坚决反对分散主义，保证国家计划的实现。比如，对关系国计民生而又供不应求的重要产品的生产与分配，要更多地发挥指令性计划的作用；为了缓解社会总需求与总供给的矛盾，治理通货膨胀，要继续执行紧缩财政和信贷的方针，控制固定资产投资规模和消费基金的增长速度；为了增强国家的宏观调控能力，应适当提高财政收入占国民收入的比重以及中央财政收入占整个财政收入的比重；在继续压缩总需求的同时，要着力调整产业结构，以增加有效供给，增强经济发展的后劲。当然，在加强经济的计划性的同时，也要努力提高计划工作水平，根据计划经济与市场调节相结合的要求，改进和完善计划管理的方式，并在整顿市场秩序的基础上，更有效地发挥市场调节的作用。
