The job of cleaning toilets is one that many people are reluctant to do. However, Zhang Liu from the Wuhan General Hospital of the Guangzhou Military Region is different. He has been cleaning all 59 toilets in the hospital every day for the past 40 years.

Since April 1950, Zhang Liu has been carrying a large iron bucket and a big broom, flushing toilets and urinals, sweeping the floors, and emptying trash cans every day. By the end of the day, he is covered in sweat and often cannot eat or drink due to nausea and vomiting. He knows that this kind of dirty and hard work is not as respected as driving a car or using a stethoscope, and there is no hope for advancement. Therefore, he once thought about changing jobs. However, he asked himself, if I don't do this dirty and hard work, who will? He made up his mind: "I am willing to be the one who is dirty to ensure that a thousand others are clean."

From then on, Zhang Liu worked even harder and more proactively. Once, a water tank broke, and the toilets were clogged. Zhang Liu first tried using a stick to unclog it and then used water to flush it, but neither method worked. So, he rolled up his sleeves and dug out the waste with his hands. Sometimes, if a toilet had deep water, he would wade in barefoot to clear the blockage. In the summer, Wuhan is famously hot, and Zhang Liu would clean and flush all 59 toilets twice a day in temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius.

Zhang Liu has had stomach pain since his youth, causing him to walk bent over. Once, he was in so much pain that he wanted to go home to rest. However, he saw a child's feces at the entrance of a toilet and, despite his pain, he supported himself and cleaned it up before leaving. One morning, his wife brought him water to drink and found him vomiting and lying on the ground. She quickly helped him to the outpatient department. The doctor diagnosed him and said he needed to be hospitalized.

Zhang Liu stayed in the hospital for a few days, but the toilets in the hospital were so dirty that no one could enter. At this time, people remembered that the hospital had such a person and asked, "Where is Zhang Liu?"

"Where is Zhang Liu?"

While in the hospital, Zhang Liu did not rest comfortably but was always thinking about the cleanliness of the toilets. Before his illness was fully treated and the doctor allowed him to leave, Zhang Liu sneaked out of the hospital room and quietly went to clean the toilets.

People like Zhang Liu, who work diligently like old oxen, are seen as dirty by some. Once, when he went to watch a movie, he had just taken his seat when a young woman next to him, seeing that it was Zhang Liu, the toilet cleaner, quickly covered her nose and moved away. His children's romantic relationships failed several times because their father was a toilet cleaner. Zhang Liu paid no mind to these things and continued to clean the toilets as before.

Now, Zhang Liu is over 60 years old and has retired. However, he has never stopped cleaning the toilets. This year, just before August 1st, he moved into a new apartment. Through his hunched back, people seemed to see a tireless bee.

### 宁肯一人脏　换来千人净

　　宁肯一人脏
　　换来千人净
　　董进
    扫厕所这个职业，有相当一部分人不愿意干。可是，广州军区武汉总医院职工张六却不是这样。他每天清扫全院的五十九个厕所，至今整整四十年。
    从一九五○年四月，他就肩背大铁桶，手提大扫把，每天冲刷马桶、尿池，清扫地板、倒纸篓，一天下来，浑身汗臭，经常吃不下饭、咽不下菜，恶心呕吐是常事。他明白，干这样的活不像开汽车、拿听诊器那样吃得开，甚至什么盼头也没有。因此，他曾萌生改行的念头。不过他又问自己，这样的脏活累活我不干，谁来干呢？他把心一横：“宁肯一人脏，也要换来千人净”。
    从此，张六更勤快更主动了。有一次，有个水箱坏了，大小便池被堵死。张六先是用木杆往下捅，接着用水冲，但是都不奏效，他便挽起袖子，将手把脏物掏出来。有时候有的厕所积水较深，他就赤着脚下水去疏通。夏天，武汉是有名的火炉，张六在四十多度的高温下，总要把五十九个厕所扫两遍、冲两遍。
    张六早年就有腹痛病，逼得他弯着腰走路。有一次他疼痛难忍，正想回去休息。但是，他看到一个厕所的门口有小孩的大便，于是又支撑着身体把这堆大便冲刷干净才蹒跚离去。一天上午，老伴来给他送水喝，发现他上吐下泻，倒在路边，赶紧将他搀扶到门诊部。医生诊断后说，要入院治疗。
    张六在病房里住了几天，医院的厕所脏得无法进人。这时候，人们才记起了医院还有这么一个人，纷纷询问：“张六哪里去了？”
  “张六哪去了？”
    张六在住院的日子里，并没有心安理得地躺下疗养，而是每时每刻都在想着那些厕所的卫生。病还未好，医生不让出院，张六便偷偷溜出病房，悄悄扫他的厕所去了。
    像张六这样勤勤恳恳的老黄牛，在有些人眼里却是臭的。有次他去看电影，刚对号入座，邻座的妙龄女郎见是扫厕所的张六，赶紧捂着鼻子躲开了。他的子女谈恋爱，就因为爸爸是扫厕所的而几度告吹。对于这些，张六都不介意，而是一如既往地扫他的厕所。
    如今，张六已经年逾六旬，退休了。可是，他清扫厕所却从未间断。今年“八一”前夕，他搬进了新楼房，人们透过他那佝偻的背影，仿佛看到了一只不知疲倦的蜜蜂。
