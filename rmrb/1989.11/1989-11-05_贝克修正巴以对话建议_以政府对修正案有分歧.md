The United States on November 1 handed Israel a revised version of the five-point proposal for Palestinian-Israeli peace talks put forward by U.S. Secretary of State James Baker.

According to reports, the new U.S. plan assures Israel that prominent members of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) will not participate in the talks. However, there are indications that the plan might allow the PLO to participate indirectly.

The report said that Baker, in his amendment, agreed to abandon the idea of having the foreign ministers of the United States, Israel, and Egypt discuss the issue of Palestinian representatives in Washington.

The amendment did not respond to Israel's demand that members of the Palestinian delegation be selected only from among Palestinian residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Baker's new plan also did not acknowledge Israel's right to veto the members of the Palestinian delegation, but it stated that if Israel is not willing to accept the members of the Palestinian delegation, it has the right to refuse to participate in the talks.

Last month, Israeli Foreign Minister Arens wrote to Baker, demanding significant revisions to the five-point proposal, asking the United States to guarantee that the PLO would not participate in the talks, and that the talks would focus solely on Israel's proposed election plan for the occupied territories.

However, the PLO insists on deciding the Palestinian representatives for the talks.

The four senior leaders of Israel's coalition government met on November 3 to discuss the revised version of the five-point proposal for Palestinian-Israeli peace talks put forward by U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, but no decision was reached.

The four leaders who attended the meeting were: Israeli Prime Minister Shamir, Foreign Minister Arens, Defense Minister Rabin, and Finance Minister Peres.

According to reports, Rabin hinted that Baker's new plan still has the possibility of being accepted by Israel.

The report said that there are differences of opinion within the Israeli authorities on the issue of the revised five-point proposal.

Peres and Rabin, who lead the Labor Party, expressed support for the amendment, while Shamir and Arens of the Likud bloc have not yet reached a consensus.

Israel's 12-member core cabinet may hold a meeting on November 4 or 5 to debate Baker's new plan.

### 贝克修正巴以对话建议  以政府对修正案有分歧

    贝克修正巴以对话建议
    以政府对修正案有分歧
    新华社开罗11月2日电  耶路撒冷消息，美国11月1日晚交给以色列一份关于国务卿贝克提出的巴以和平谈判5点建议的修正案。
    据报道，美国的这项新方案向以色列保证，巴解组织知名成员将不参加巴以会谈。但有消息说，方案使巴解组织有间接参加会谈的可能。
    报道说，贝克在修正案里同意放弃美、以、埃3国外长在华盛顿讨论巴勒斯坦谈判代表问题的想法。
    修正案对以色列提出的关于巴代表团成员只能由约旦河西岸和加沙地带的巴勒斯坦居民中产生的要求没有作出答复。贝克的新方案也没有承认以色列有否决巴代表团成员的权利，但以色列如不愿接受巴代表团成员人选，它有权拒绝参加会谈。
    以色列外长阿伦斯上月给贝克写信，要求对贝克5点建议作重大修改，要美国保证巴解组织不参加会谈，会谈只集中讨论以色列提出的被占领土选举计划。
    但巴解组织仍坚持由它来决定巴勒斯坦谈判代表的人选。
    新华社开罗11月3日电  耶路撒冷消息，以色列联合政府4位高级领导人3日开会，讨论美国国务卿贝克提出的关于巴以和谈5点建议的修正案，但没有形成任何决定。
    参加会晤的4位领导人是：以色列总理沙米尔、外交部长阿伦斯、国防部长拉宾和财政部长佩雷斯。
    据报道，拉宾暗示，贝克的新方案仍然有得到以色列认可的可能。
    报道说，在贝克5点建议修正案问题上，以色列当局内部存在分歧。
    以佩雷斯和拉宾为首的工党表示支持修正案，而沙米尔和阿伦斯的利库德集团则尚未取得一致意见。
    以色列12人的核心内阁有可能在4日或5日开会，对贝克的新方案进行辩论。
