The world's largest particle accelerator—the European "LEP" positron-electron collider—was officially completed today. The project's executive director, Professor Émilie Piccard, handed over the keys to the facility to the chairman of the European Organization for Nuclear Research, Professor Carlo Rubbia.

The LEP collider is located in an underground tunnel beneath the Jura Mountains on the border between France and Switzerland. The tunnel is 50 to 150 meters deep, has a diameter of 3.8 meters, and a circumference of 27 kilometers. It can simulate the conditions of the universe during the Big Bang billions of years ago, allowing positrons and electrons to collide at near the speed of light. Scientists observe the various new phenomena that occur during these collisions to explore the most fundamental structures of matter and uncover the mysteries of the universe's origins.

Construction of the LEP collider began in 1983, two years after the project was approved by the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The entire project was completed in July of this year, with a total cost of 1.3 billion Swiss francs.

Three weeks of testing have shown that the LEP particle accelerator can reach a maximum energy of over 1,000 billion electron volts and can produce large quantities of "Z" particles. These particles allow scientists to study their mass, lifespan, decay, and other properties, furthering our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe.

Dr. Rubbia, the director of the European Organization for Nuclear Research and a Nobel laureate in physics, noted in his speech that the operation of the LEP collider is the result of the united efforts of 14 European member countries. It signifies Europe's leading position in the field of fundamental particle physics research. The completion of the LEP collider is also the product of years of collaboration between European scientists and over 1,500 scientists from around the world, including those from China, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

French President François Mitterrand, Swiss Federal Council President René Felber, and King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden attended the official completion ceremony of the LEP collider held at the European Organization for Nuclear Research today and delivered congratulatory speeches.

    世界最大正负电子对撞机落成
    新华社日内瓦11月13日电　（记者向奎观、施光耀）世界上最大的粒子加速器——欧洲“莱泼”正负电子对撞机筹建计划执行主任埃米里埃·皮卡索教授，今天在该机正式落成典礼上将其钥匙交给了欧洲核子研究中心主席卡尔罗·鲁比亚教授。
    “莱泼”正负电子对撞机座落在法国和瑞士边界汝拉山下的一条地下隧道里。这条隧道深50至150米、直径3.8米、周长2.7万米。它能模拟宇宙在数亿年前大爆炸时的情景，让正负电子在对撞机内循着相反方向、以光的速度运行、相撞。科学家通过观察正负电子撞击时出现的各种新现象，来探索物质的最基本结构，揭开宇宙诞生的奥秘。
      “莱泼”对撞机的建设工程始于1983年，即筹建计划经欧洲核子研究中心批准两年之后。整个工程于今年7月建成，共耗资13亿瑞士法郎。
    3周的试验结果表明，“莱泼”粒子加速器最大能量可达到1000多亿电子伏，并能大量生产“Z”粒子，供科学家们研究该粒子本身的质量、寿命、衰变等特性，进一步了解宇宙运动的基本规律。
    欧洲核子研究中心主任、诺贝尔物理奖得主鲁比亚博士在典礼上指出，“莱泼”机的运行是欧洲核子研究中心14个欧洲成员国团结、努力的结果。它标志着欧洲在粒子物理基础研究领域里居领先地位。“莱泼”机的建成也是欧洲科学家与世界各国科学家共1500多人多年合作的产物，其中有来自中国、美国和苏联等国的科学家。
    法国总统密特朗、瑞士联邦政府主席德拉穆拉兹和瑞典国王卡尔十六世·古斯塔夫出席了今天在欧洲核子研究中心举行的“莱泼”对撞机正式落成典礼，并发表了贺词。
