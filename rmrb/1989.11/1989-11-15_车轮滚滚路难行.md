	Rolling Wheels, Difficult Roads
	One Turn of the Wheel, Endless Fines

	The Shandong Hanzhou Regional Transportation Company's Cao Fumin and Yao Weixin write: In our province, Jining City is a place that makes drivers of passing vehicles headache. On August 26, we were driving a minibus to Jining. About 500 meters from the Runhe Grand Bridge, we were stopped by the Jining City Zhongqu Road Traffic Inspection Station. We were told to enter the inspection station's courtyard because of additional fees and vehicle type issues. In the station's office, more than 10 drivers were waiting to be fined. In less than 10 minutes, many out-of-town vehicles were fined 30 to 50 yuan for various reasons. Our vehicle was fined 20 yuan, plus an additional 5 yuan for parking.

	On August 29, we passed through the Jining City suburban traffic inspection station and were fined 15 yuan for additional fees and unclear vehicle numbers, plus 5 yuan for parking.

	We believe that fining vehicles from units and individuals who drive without licenses, with incomplete documents, or with faulty vehicles, endangering public safety, is completely correct. However, Jining City's vehicle management department's nitpicking approach is unacceptable, and they should not charge so-called parking fees.

	In August, we went to Xi'an and Jinan and were stopped and checked for documents more than 20 times. They had no questions about our vehicle's documents. On August 26, after being fined in Jining City, it was the same vehicle with the same documents and the same crew. That day, we passed through Linyi, Qingdao, and Qufu, where the traffic police checked us multiple times and let us go. Is it that they do not strictly enforce the policy? Or is it that Jining City's vehicle management department is taking advantage of every opportunity to fine us?

	Shanxi Tianzhen County's Li Shan and Li Jie write: Statistics show that from last July to this July, our county's transportation company's buses paid a total of 360,000 yuan in various fines and fees (excluding road maintenance fees and taxes). On April 25 this year, a driver named Lei drove to Henan Xuchang City to pick up a flour mill machine. In Bo'ai County, he was stopped by traffic police, who took his driver's license and gave it to an innkeeper, extorting 85 yuan from him. In Qin County, he was forced to buy a fire extinguisher at a high price, even though his vehicle already had one. In five days, Lei's vehicle was fined and charged a total of 510 yuan.

	Frequent fines make drivers afraid to drive during the day. The manager of the transportation company, Yang Yinu, said, "Some fines are allowed by the state and are beneficial to the safe operation of vehicles. But the frequent and high amounts of fines are unbearable."

	Disjointed Policies, Confusion Everywhere

	Shandong Yantai Daily's Gong Zhi Cheng writes: According to many drivers, the chaos of setting up checkpoints, collecting fees, and issuing fines is almost everywhere on the roads. A driver from Yantai Port Logistics Company was fined more than 200 times on a trip to Inner Mongolia. A driver from Yantai Foreign Trade Fleet was fined 55 times on a trip to Xi'an. A driver from Yantai Automobile 5th Depot was fined more than 270 yuan on a trip to Tianjin.

	Drivers usually have to carry more than a dozen documents when they go out, such as driver's license, vehicle license, lighting qualification certificate, road maintenance fee certificate, operating license, additional fee certificate, etc. Bus drivers also need to carry a route number plate. If transporting fruits, they need to carry afforestation fund certificates and quarantine certificates. If transporting oversized items, they need to carry oversized item operation pass. However, among these dozen documents, only the driver's license, vehicle license, and road maintenance fee certificate can be used nationwide. Other documents are not recognized by various provinces and regions, and fines are issued based on this. For example, Yantai Automobile Transportation Company, which travels a short distance to Weihai City to transport oversized items, has the necessary permits from Yantai City's Economic Commission, Public Security, and Transportation departments, but these permits become invalid as soon as they reach Weihai's jurisdiction. They must be reissued in Weihai City, otherwise, they will be fined, and sometimes fined first and then issued. Some vehicles, despite having installed emission control devices and obtained emission control certificates, are not recognized as soon as they leave the region or county boundary, and are fined without hesitation. Even more puzzling is that Shandong Province requires cargo vehicles to install protective nets, and if not, they are fined; however, when the vehicle travels to some provinces, it is fined for having installed protective nets; Shandong Province's vehicles have square-cornered protective nets, while some provinces require round-cornered protective nets, and if not, they are fined.

	Fines for drivers are not just from the traffic police's traffic brigade or detachment. Due to the multiple issuing authorities, various provinces and regions divide the territory, and policies are issued from multiple sources. Public Security, Transportation, Taxation, Industry and Commerce, Environmental Protection, Forestry, and Insurance departments can all send people to the roads to check vehicles and issue fines. Unjustified fines, fines without receipts, and extortion incidents occur frequently. The Yantai Automobile Transportation Company, which is at the forefront of the national automobile transportation industry, was fined more than 300,000 yuan for "unreasonable fines" last year, and this year, from January to April, "unreasonable fines" have already exceeded 100,000 yuan.

	Civilized Law Enforcement, Legal Operations

	Hebei Shijiazhuang's Wei Wenli and Ku Yonghao write: Recently, we participated in a meeting held by the Hebei Cangzhou Region Traffic Police Detachment for regional unit automobile team leaders. The attendees reflected that road fines are common, and fine tickets have become pass tickets. A comrade from the regional supply and marketing cooperative said, "Our unit already has 5 drivers who have applied to quit."

	How to solve the problem of excessive fines? The regional public security bureau and the regional traffic police detachment leadership conducted a special study on this and believe:

	We must rectify the business direction, rectify the problem of traffic police managing people and everything for money, and establish the idea that management is service.

	We must establish and improve the "two opennesses and one supervision" system, publicize the policies and procedures for handling matters, set up suggestion boxes and hotlines; formulate traffic police's code of conduct for performing duties, and through supervision, place the power of traffic police under the regulation of laws, regulations, and systems.

	We must strengthen organizational construction, rectify team discipline, and for letters and visits reporting police misconduct, we must investigate every report and have results.

	We must change the situation of multiple authorities issuing policies and strengthen unified traffic management.

### 车轮滚滚路难行

第6版(读者来信)
专栏：调查与思考

    车轮滚滚路难行
    车轮一转  罚款不断
    山东菏泽地区运输公司曹福民姚维信来信：我省济宁市，是个令过往车辆的司机头疼的地方。8月26日，我们乘面包车行至济宁运河大桥下约500米处，被济宁市市中区公路交通检查站工作人员拦住，以附加费、车型不符为由，令开进检查站院内。在站书记室里，10多名司机在等候罚款处理。不足10分钟，许多外地车辆先后被以各种理由罚款30—50元。我们的车被罚20元，外加5元停车费。
    8月29日，我们路过济宁市郊区交通检查站时，又被以附加费、车号不清为由罚款15元和5元停车费。
    我们认为，对那些无证开车，证、章不齐，带故障开车等置人民生命财产于不顾的单位和个人的车辆实施罚款处理，是完全正确的，但济宁市车辆管理部门吹毛求疵的做法是不可取的，也不该索取所谓的停车费。
    我们8月份曾到过西安、济南，被停车检查证件20余次，他们对该车所有证件无一疑问。26日我们在济宁市被罚款后，还是这辆车，原有的证件和原套人马，当天途经临沂、青岛、曲阜等地，交警部门查过多次，均予放行。是他们掌握政策不严呢？还是济宁市车管部门雁过拔毛呢？
    山西天镇县李山　李杰来信：据统计，我县运输公司客车从去年7月到今年7月付出名目繁多的罚款、收费达36万元（不包括养路费、税金）。今年4月25日，一位姓雷的司机驾车到河南许昌市拉磨面机，在博爱县被交警队员拦截，将雷的驾驶执照交给一家旅店老板，被敲诈了85元；在沁县，被强迫高价购买一个消防器，而车上已配有消防器。5天的时间，雷师傅的车被罚款、收费510元。
    过频的罚款使司机不敢白天出车。运输公司经理杨荫录说：“有些罚款是国家允许的，对于车辆安全运行有益。可动辄罚款，金额之大，令人难以忍受。”
     政出多门  无所适从
    山东烟台日报社耿治成来信：据许多司机反映，现在乱设卡乱收费乱罚款，几乎遍及到全国每一条公路。烟台港务局储运公司驾驶员于某，跑一趟内蒙古被罚款200多次；烟台外贸车队一名驾驶员，跑一趟西安被罚款55次；烟台汽车5场一名驾驶员，跑一趟天津被罚款270多元。
    司机们出车通常要带十几个证件，如驾驶证、行车证、灯光合格证、养路费证、营运证、附加费证等等，客车司机还需带车次牌证。如果装运水果，还需带育林基金证、检疫证；装运超长物资，需带超长物资营运通行证。然而，在这十几个证件中，只有驾驶证、行车证和养路费证可以通行全国，其它证件各省、各地区都可互不承认，并据此罚款。如烟台汽车运输公司往距离不远的威海市装运超长物资，烟台市经委、公安、交通等有关部门办理的通行证，一到威海地界就失灵了，必须到威海市重新办理，否则就要罚款，甚至先罚款后办理。有些车辆，尽管安上了排污装置，领取了排污证，但是一出地区或县界就不被承认，照罚不误。更令人不解的是，山东省要求货运车辆安装防护网，不安就罚款；然而当车辆行驶到有的省，却又因安装了防护网而被罚款；山东省的车辆安装的防护网是方角，而有的省要求安装的防护网是圆角，只因不是圆角就要被罚款。
    对驾驶员的罚款，不只是公安部门的交通大队或支队。由于发证单位多，各省各地区划地为牢，政出多门，公安、交通、税务、工商、环保、林业、保险等部门，都可派人到公路上查车罚款。无端罚款，罚后不开票据或敲诈勒索等事件，便屡有发生。荣膺全国汽车运输行业排头兵的烟台汽车运输公司，去年仅“不合理罚款”就达30多万元，今年1至4月份，“不合理罚款”已经突破10万元大关。
         文明值勤  依法行事
  河北石家庄市魏文立　库永浩来信：前一段，我们参加河北沧州地区交警支队召开的地区单位汽车队长座谈会。与会同志反映公路罚款成风，罚款单变成了通行证。地区供销社的同志说：“我们单位已有5名司机写申请不干了。”
    如何解决乱罚问题？地区公安处和地区交警支队领导对此进行了专门研究，他们认为：
    要端正业务方向，整顿以交警管人者自居和一切向钱看的问题，树立管理就是服务的思想。
      要建立健全“两公开一监督”制度，公开办事政策和手续程序，设立举报箱，举报电话；制定交通干警执行公务守则，通过监督把交通干警的权力置于法律、法规、制度的规范之中。
      要加强组织建设，整顿队伍纪律，对来信来访反映干警违纪事情，要做到有举必查，查必有果。
      改变政出多门状况，加强交通统一管理。
