The stone archway at Dongmen, Xiangyou County, stands like a heavenly gate, towering beside the road from Licheng to the famous scenic area of Nine Carp Lake. In ancient times, this was the first stop on the bustling official road, and thus the archway was built here. Its artistic achievement is rare in the history of ancient archway carvings in Minbei. In the Qing Dynasty, the imperial examiner Wu Libu praised this archway as "the first under heaven." After liberation, it was listed as one of the key protected cultural relics in Fujian Province.

This stone archway is exquisitely crafted, with an intricate structure and features of ancient palace architecture. The entire archway is about 10 meters high, with identical floral patterns and carvings on both the front and back. The top of the archway features two dragons facing the sky, with a red sun rising amidst flames. The archway is divided into three tiers, each with distinct roofs featuring upturned eaves, glazed tiles, and carp-shaped ridges. The upper tier suspends a vertical plaque inscribed with "Yuyin." The plaque is flanked by a pair of small dragons, each with a diameter of less than 3 centimeters. The dragons' eyes, whiskers, claws, and scales are vividly depicted, showing no signs of chisel marks. On either side, there are carved dragon pillars, with small horizontal beams at the top supporting a pendant shaped like a peony bud. The middle tier features stone pillars adorned with various precious flowers such as plum blossoms, peonies, peonies, lotuses, camellias, and roses. On the curved walls of the archway, there are relief sculptures depicting scenes of "Farewell at the Riverbank" and "The Orchid Pavilion Gathering," as well as historical figures like Su Shi and Bao Zheng, whose forms are lifelike. The lower tier is inscribed with the names, deeds, and dates of the archway's patrons, who were awarded by imperial decree with gold and silk. The edges of the plaque are decorated with auspicious animals like qilin, phoenixes, tortoises, and dragons, symbolizing good fortune, nobility, and longevity. Below the main structure, there are four large square stone pillars, each reinforced with stone strips, supporting the entire archway. The pillars are surrounded by curved stone railings for protection. According to the county's architectural department, this stone archway belongs to the ancient archway architectural form of "Gui Gong Dou" as described in the "Yingzao Fashi."

According to the county museum, during the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, there was a man named Chen Tianhao in Xiangyou who made a fortune in the tobacco business, amassing a wealth of a million taels. He donated funds to establish the Jin Shi Academy (the predecessor of Xiangyou County First Middle School). The Daoguang Emperor personally inscribed "Loving Kindness and Charity," and ordered the construction of the archway. The construction of this archway began in the fifth year of the Daoguang reign (1825 AD) and took over 30 years to complete, involving three generations of the family. It is said that the powder from the carving was as valuable as gold, indicating the enormous cost and difficulty of the project.

    仙游东门石坊
    林德基
    仙游县东门外石牌坊，像一座仙界天门，屹立在鲤城通往著名风景区九鲤湖的公路旁。当年，这里是繁荣官道首站，因而牌坊建在此地。它的艺术造诣，在八闽古代牌坊雕刻史上是罕见的。清代学政乌利布赞誉斯坊为“天下第一”。解放后，列为福建省重点保护文物之一。
    这座石牌坊工艺精美，结构奇巧，具有古代宫殿建筑特色。全坊高10来米，正反两面花纹图案，雕饰一致。坊顶双龙朝天，一轮红日，熊熊腾焰从中冉起。牌坊梯状三个层次，各以飞檐翘角、琉璃石瓦、鲤鱼脊梁的屋盖，明显区别之。上层，斜悬竖立一块刻有“玉音”牌座。牌座边镶着一对小龙，直径不及3厘米，龙眼、龙须、龙爪、龙鳞，清晰遒劲，绝无斧凿锥琢之痕。左右浮雕龙柱，上端两边贯着小横梁，垂拱牡丹花蕊“吊筒”；中层，坊亭石柱上，遍饰着梅花、牡丹、芍药、荷花、山茶、玫瑰等名贵花卉。在“曲背”式的坊亭壁上，浮雕着“江干送别”的依依情景和兰亭雅集的高情逸致等故事画。尤其是匾下一组历史人物画面，如苏轼、包拯等，造型栩栩如生；下层中间题刻着“特旨匾奖、御赐金帛”的坊主姓名、事迹和年代。匾缘饰缀着古时象征吉祥、高贵和长寿的麟凤龟龙等珍禽异兽。主体三部之下，便是四大方形匝角的石柱，每柱各以石条夹持加固，支撑全坊。坊柱周围有曲径的石栏杆护卫。县建筑部门技术鉴定，这座石坊属于《营造法原》建筑理论中的“圭拱斗”古代牌坊建筑形式。
    据县博物馆考据：清道光年间，仙游有位名叫陈天高的人，经营烟叶发家致富，家资达百万。他解囊兴资办学，建金石书院（即现在仙游县第一中学的前身）。道光皇帝亲笔御题“乐善好施”，下旨建坊。这座牌坊破土动工于清朝道光5年（公元1825年），历时30多年才告竣工，有祖孙三代相承参与建坊的，传闻雕琢的粉末与金子相等，足见耗资之巨，工程之艰。
