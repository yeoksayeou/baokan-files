The art of couplets appeared early and is widespread. In the bronze inscriptions of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, there were already couplets, and later in the Han fu, the ornate prose of the Six Dynasties, and Tang dynasty regulated verse, the art of couplets reached its pinnacle.

The art of couplets in poetry and prose is both a rhetorical art and an aesthetic art. However, apart from Liu Xie's "Lìcí" (Chapter on Ornate Language) in the "Wénxīn Diǎolóng" (The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons), there has not been a comprehensive and profound study on couplets in China to this day. Although Mr. Wang Li published "Hàn Yǔ Shī Lǜ Xué" (The Metrics of Classical Chinese Poetry), he discussed couplet theory very little. In contemporary Japan, the study of rhetoric has become a hot topic, and the re-evaluation of classical rhetoric is particularly prevalent. It is in this context of the research boom in the aesthetics of poetry and prose that the renowned Japanese Sinologist Koda Keiichi wrote "The Art of Couplets in Chinese Literature" (translated by Lǐ Miǎo, published by Jílín Wénshǐ Chūbǎnshè).

Koda Keiichi was born on April 7, 1921, in Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. He is currently the honorary professor of Hiroshima University, the president of the Hiroshima Prefectural Japan-China Friendship Association, a professor and head of the Chinese Department at Kishiwada University. He has also been elected as a director of the Japan China Studies Association, the Chinese Language Association, and the National Association of Chinese Language Education. To deepen his study of Sinology, he has visited China four times. His major published works include "Shìshuō Xīn Yǔ Wúwén" (Lost Texts of the Shishuo Xinyu), "Shìshuō Xīn Yǔ Jiǎokǎn Biǎo" (Collation Table of the Shishuo Xinyu), "Wénshì Zhuàn Jíběn" (Collected Editions of the Wen Shi Zhuan), "Zhōngguó de Wénhuà yǔ Jiàoyù" (Culture and Education in China), "Sīchóu Zhīlù de Lìshǐ yǔ Wénxué" (The History and Literature of the Silk Road), "Xiūcí yǔ Wéntǐ" (Rhetoric and Style), and "Zhōngguó Wénxué shàng de Bǐjiào Wénxué Yánjiū" (Comparative Literature Studies in Chinese Literature).

"The Art of Couplets in Chinese Literature" is a book that spans ancient and modern times, and covers both East and West. It is a work of meticulous research and profound insight. It is said to be profound because the entire book has a rigorous system and deep theoretical foundation. The book, with 260,000 words in seven chapters, uses extensive data to deeply analyze the principles, classification, evaluation, and phenomena of couplets. It not only covers various eras but also various fields, providing detailed and interesting discussions on actual works in the fields of poetry, prose, and parallel prose. Furthermore, from a comparative literature perspective, it uses the couplets in Japanese and Western European literature to analyze the beauty of order in Chinese characters. It is said to be profound because the book's theoretical foundation is high. Mr. Koda believes that couplet expressions are a major feature of Chinese literary expression and are deeply rooted in the Chinese worldview. They are one of the most important research topics in Chinese literature.

Mr. Koda pays great attention to the methodology of his arguments. Apart from the systematic nature of the book, the author grasps the essence of couplets from the perspective of the yin-yang duality and uses this as a basis to examine the establishment of couplets as a literary expression. The author also strives to explore the essence of couplets from a modern perspective and has made a convincing affirmation of the artistic value and significance of couplets.

The classification of couplets in Chinese literature, although mentioned in the "Lìcí" chapter of the "Wénxīn Diǎolóng" and the "29 types of couplets" in the "Dōng Juǎn" of the "Wénjìng Mìfǔ Luǎn," is considered by Mr. Koda to be "inadequate" or "mechanical." In his own work, he considers the classification criteria from the essence of couplets, first dividing all couplets into two major categories: "formal couplets" and "semantic couplets," and then further subdividing them based on several classification criteria, resulting in a systematic classification.

　　《中国文学的对句艺术》
　　俞慈韵
    对句艺术出现很早，也很广泛。中国在商周时代的金文中就有对句，以后的汉赋、六朝骈丽文、唐律诗等，将对句发展到了极致。
    诗文的对句艺术，既是修辞艺术，又是美学艺术。但除了梁刘勰《文心雕龙》中有《丽辞》这一集中的对句理论文献外，我国至今没有一部全面精深的研究对句的专著。虽然王力先生曾出版过《汉语诗律学》，但对句理论讲得很少。而在当今的日本，修辞学研究已成热门，对古典修辞学的再评价尤为盛行。正是在诗文美学艺术的研究热潮中，日本著名汉学家古田敬一先生撰写了《中国文学的对句艺术》（李淼译，吉林文史出版社出版）这一著作。
    古田敬一，1921年4月7日生于日本广岛市安佐南区西原，现任广岛大学名誉教授、广岛县日中友好协会会长、姬路独协大学教授、中文系主任。并被选为日本中国学会理事、中国语学会理事、全国汉文教育学会理事。为了深入研究汉学，他曾4次访问中国。已问世的主要汉学研究专著有《世说新语佚文》、《世说新语校勘表》、《文士传辑本》、《中国的文化与教育》、《丝绸之路的历史与文学》、《修辞与文体》和《中国文学上的比较文学研究》等。
      《中国文学的对句艺术》一书纵览古今，横贯东西，竭精殚智，钩沉发微，达到了含英咀华。说它咀华，是因为全书具有严密的系统性和深刻的理论性。全书26万字分7章，以翔实的资料，精深地论析了对句的原理、分类、评价和现象，不但涉及各个时代，还涉及各个领域，对诗、散文、骈文各个领域的实际作品进行了饶有意趣的细致探讨，并且从比较学的角度，以日本、西欧文学的对句来分析了中国文字的整齐美。说它含英，是该书的立论基点高。古田先生认为，对偶表现，是中国文学表现上一大特色，在中国人的世界观中已牢牢扎根，是中国文学中最重要的研究课题之一。
  古田先生很讲求论述的方法论。该书除了系统性，作者从阴阳二元论去把握对句的根本，并以此为基础，去考察作为文学表现的对句的成立。作者还努力从现代的观点上，探讨对偶的本质。对对句的艺术价值及意义作了有说服力的肯定。
    中国文学的对句分类，虽有《文心雕龙·丽辞》篇和《文镜秘府论》东卷所述的“言对，事对，正对，反对”及“29种对”，但古田先生认为是“不充分的”或“机械的”，而在自己的著作中从对句的本质考虑分类标准，首先把全部对句大别为“形式对”与“意义对”两类，再进一步依据几个分类标准细分，作出了系统的分类。
