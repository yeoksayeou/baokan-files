State Chairman Yang Shangkun said today that the new leadership team, headed by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, which was established in June, has proven to be stable, strong, and supported by the people after more than four months of work. It has the capability to overcome the current economic difficulties facing China.

He made these remarks during a luncheon meeting with a delegation from the Thai National Assembly, led by General Preecha Hemaboon, the First Deputy Speaker of the Senate. Yang Shangkun, while briefing the Thai guests on the situation in China, said that the domestic situation, including that in Beijing, is stable. Although China is facing some economic difficulties, these can be overcome if the entire nation is mobilized.

He emphasized the importance of a stable situation for China's construction. He said, "China is so large and has such a large population. Without a stable situation, it is impossible to carry out construction. Anarchy and a state of lawlessness cause great harm to the country."

In discussing Sino-Thai bilateral relations, Yang Shangkun said that since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two countries have maintained good relations. The relationship between the two countries can be said to be a model of friendly cooperation between countries with different social systems. He welcomed increased friendly exchanges between the parliaments of the two countries, believing that this would be beneficial to both sides.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Liao Hansheng, attended the meeting.

    杨尚昆会见泰国客人时说
    中国新的领导班子是坚强的
    新华社北京十一月十二日电 （记者周慈朴）国家主席杨尚昆今天在这里说，今年六月间确定的以江泽民总书记为核心的中国新的领导班子，经过四个多月的工作，证明是稳定的、坚强的、受到人民支持的，是有能力克服当前中国经济所面临的困难的。
    他是在今天中午会见由上议院第一副议长披实·赫马布上将率领的泰国国会代表团时，对中国新的领导班子作出这一评价的。杨尚昆在向泰国客人介绍中国情况时说，现在国内局势，包括北京局势，是安定的。虽然中国在经济上有一些困难，但只要把全国人民动员起来，困难是能够被克服的。
    他强调了稳定的局势对中国建设的重要性。他说，中国那么大，人口又那么多，没有一个稳定的局势就无法搞建设。无政府主义和无政府状态对国家的损害很大。
    在谈到中泰双边关系时，杨尚昆说，中泰两国自建交以来，关系一直发展得很好，两国关系可以说是不同社会制度国家之间友好合作的典范。他欢迎中泰两国议会加强友好往来，认为这对双方都有利。
    全国人大常委会副委员长廖汉生参加了会见。
