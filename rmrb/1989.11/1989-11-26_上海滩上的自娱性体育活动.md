	Shanghai residents are no longer satisfied with the traditional "old three" exercises of calisthenics, martial arts, and running. Instead, they have taken a liking to recreational, social, and entertaining activities such as arm wrestling, tug-of-war, arm wrestling, water sumo wrestling, and sports challenge matches. People are enjoying leisurely sports that are popular and memorable, seeking fashion and sports entertainment.

	Arm wrestling, a folk art with a long history in China, is often enjoyed by people during tea breaks, after meals, or during leisure time. They casually set up a match at the corner of a table, showcasing their strength. Records show that there have been international arm wrestling competitions in Athens and between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. However, holding an arm wrestling competition in Shanghai is a first in the country. News of the event attracted over three hundred participants, including sixteen women.

	Interestingly, a specially designed arm wrestling platform is set up with two handles, each about fifteen centimeters long, for the contestants to grip with their left hands. The competition consists of a single round, with the winner determined in an instant.

	The diverse group of participants includes hotel chefs, factory workers, farmers, armed police, students, unemployed youth, and individual entrepreneurs, all drawn together by their shared interest in the sport.

	Sumo wrestling has been popular in Japan for a long time. Water sumo wrestling, a self-designed interest competition, borrows this form and attracts curious spectators by requiring contestants to push each other into the water.

	In a standard swimming pool, a platform is constructed twenty-five centimeters above the water surface. On the three-and-a-half-meter-diameter platform, covered with a red synthetic carpet, the scene is illuminated by lights reflecting off the clear water. Over fifty brave individuals were the first to try out this "crab's flavor" in this all-male world, divided into lightweight, middleweight, and heavyweight categories based on their weight.

	This competition, which combines sumo wrestling, judo, and wrestling, is both thrilling and risky, with the advantage shifting in an instant. Only those who are both smart and brave can seize the opportunity.

	Water tug-of-war. Tracing its historical origins, the tug-of-war that emerged during the Ming Dynasty was conducted on rivers. This time, the competition returns to its original form. On a river six to seven meters wide, two teams of contestants, barefoot and shirtless, face off from opposite banks. Amidst cheers, the thick hemp rope moves back and forth like the "Chu-Han border." The party secretary of the Cotton Mill No. 12 personally leads the cheerleading team, shouting in rhythm to encourage the athletes to exert their full strength, pulling the opposing team's vanguard into the river to win the victory. There are also "Water Flying Crossing" and "Water Shooting" that are equally attractive.

	Why are these recreational sports activities so appealing? Because participation is key.

	The introduction of these entertaining and recreational competitions is a result of people's innovative approach to sports activities in the context of reform and opening up. The liberated-minded people have a broader and deeper understanding of life.

### 上海滩上的自娱性体育活动

　　上海滩上的自娱性体育活动
    如今，上海市民已不满足以往的做操、打拳、跑步“老三样”，而迷上了自娱性、社会性、趣味性强的拉磅秤、角力、扳手腕、水上相扑、体育摆擂台……人们在喜闻乐见、令人回味的余暇运动中，追求时尚，寻求体育乐趣。
    扳手腕，这一民间小技在我国有着悠久历史。茶余饭后，工余闲暇，人们随意地在桌角边摆开架势，在扳手劲中显示实力。有资料介绍，世界上曾有雅典国际扳手腕、美苏扳手腕比赛。可在上海举办扳手腕比赛，却是国内头一遭。消息传出，竟有三百多人报名参加，居然还有十六名“半边天”加盟。
    有趣的是，特制的咫尺赛台，两位选手面前各有一根十五厘米左右的把手，可供左手握住。比赛仅设一个回合，胜负就在一瞬间产生。
    众多的参赛者，汇集着社会各阶层人士，有宾馆厨师、工厂钳工、农民、武警战士，也有留学生、待业青年、个体户，为着共同的兴趣爱好，相继报名来到小小的比赛台前。
    相扑，在日本经久不衰。水上相扑，则是借用这一形式，由人们自我设计的兴趣比赛，因其以将对方推入水中而吸引着好奇的观众。
    标准的游泳池内，新搭起一座高出水面二十五厘米的比赛台，三点五米直径的擂台上，铺设着绛红色的化纤地毯。灯光下，与一池碧水交相辉映。五十余名勇敢者率先来此尝试
  “螃蟹的鲜味”。这清一色的男子汉世界里，按体重分为轻量级、中量级和重量级。
    这项融相扑、柔道、摔跤于一体的比赛，既惊又险，优劣势转眼即变，极富竞争性。唯有智勇双全者，方能把握战机。
    水上拔河比赛。追溯历史渊源，明朝兴起的拔河就是在河上进行。此番比赛，也使其回归正宗。在六七米宽的河面上，两队队员赤足光臂，隔岸对峙。一片加油声中，那粗粗的麻绳就像“楚河汉界”，左右移动。上棉十二厂党委书记亲任啦啦队长，有节奏的呐喊助威，为运动员加足马力，把对方排头兵拔入河内，赢得胜利。还有，“水上飞渡”、“水上打靶”也极具吸引力。
    这些自娱性的体育活动项目何以如此吸引人？因为重要的是参与。
    趣味性、自娱性比赛的推出，是人们在改革开放形势下在体育活动中创新的结果。思想解放了的人民群众对生活有着更广泛、更深刻的理解。（一九八九年第十一期《新体育》平萍文）
