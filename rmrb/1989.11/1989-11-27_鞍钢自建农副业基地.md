Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation (Anshan Steel) adheres to the principle of "one hand for production, one hand for living," rapidly developing its agricultural and sideline production. Currently, the entire corporation has established 135 food production bases, annually supplying workers with 4,929 tons of fish, meat, and eggs.

To effectively address the "vegetable basket" issue for workers, Anshan Steel has formulated a series of regulations and widely implemented the contract responsibility system in production. Each year, the production of pork, eggs, fish, and shrimp, when calculated per person for the 220,000 workers, averages 21 kilograms per person.
