November 18th marked the 90th anniversary of Comrade Li Lisan's birth. As we remember this outstanding leader of the proletarian revolution and the Chinese workers' movement, we must not forget his remarkable contributions to the development of the Chinese workers' movement and trade union work. During the early days of our Party, Li Lisan directly participated in the initiation, organization, and leadership of the workers' movement. Along with Comrades Liu Shaoqi and others, he led the Anshan Miners' Great Strike, which significantly advanced the workers' movement in Jiangxi, Hunan, and across the nation. He also played a key role in the May 30th Movement and the workers' movement in Wuhan during the Northern Expedition, making substantial contributions to the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and feudalism. On the eve of the founding of New China, he, following the directives of the Party Central Committee, took charge of preparing for the restoration of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. In August 1948, at the Sixth National Labor Congress, he was elected as the Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and was responsible for the daily work of the federation until the end of 1951. The founding of New China marked a fundamental change in the status of the Chinese working class, transforming it from an oppressed and exploited class to the leading class of the state. The direction of the workers' movement under the new historical conditions was a major new issue. Li Lisan, following the Party Central Committee's policies, made significant contributions to the development of the workers' movement in New China. He devoted himself to building the organizational structure of the trade unions, quickly organizing workers nationwide, and ensuring the smooth progress of various trade union activities. He oversaw the drafting of important documents and policies such as the "Constitution of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions," the "Labor Union Law of the People's Republic of China," and the "Regulations on Labor Insurance of the People's Republic of China." Simultaneously, he conducted serious theoretical explorations in the field of labor movement theory, proposing many valuable ideas. He argued that after seizing state power, the Chinese working class had the responsibility to undertake the arduous task of building New China and to play a model leadership role. He dialectically analyzed the contradictions within state-owned enterprises, believing that there was no longer class antagonism or exploitation, and that the interests of the public and private sectors were completely aligned. He believed that the Party, government, trade unions, and youth leagues in enterprises should first emphasize this alignment. However, he also acknowledged that there were specific contradictions between public and private interests, which should not be ignored but should be resolved through a policy of mutual consideration and coordination. He advocated that trade unions should first grasp the alignment of public and private interests, continuously educate workers to raise their consciousness, and strive to improve production. However, they should also pay more attention to and represent the daily interests of workers, genuinely fulfilling their role in protecting workers' interests. These ideas had a significant impact on the development of labor movement theory in our country. From Li Lisan's discussions on the necessity of closely relying on the working class and playing the role of the main force in socialist construction, we can see his foresight.

On the eve of the founding of New China, the Party's Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee clearly stated that the Party's work focus would shift from rural areas to cities, and in urban work, we must fully rely on the working class. At that time, not all comrades deeply understood this guiding ideology. Li Lisan, combining the workers' movement and trade union work, theoretically expounded on this important guiding ideology proposed by the Party Central Committee, analyzing the new historical position, role, and responsibilities of the working class. At the National Trade Union Work Conference held in July 1949, Li Lisan clearly pointed out: "If, during the war, the People's Liberation Army was the main force, then during the period of economic construction, the working class should be the main force. We, the working class, fully understand that we are different from any other ruling class in the past. In the past, the feudal class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, after seizing power, used the method of exploiting other classes and oppressing the majority of the people to enjoy themselves. The working class is different. We cannot and should not compensate ourselves at the expense of other people to live a more comfortable life. The working class can only be liberated when all the people are liberated, and our lives can only improve when the lives of all the people improve. Therefore, the working class must strive for the liberation of the entire nation and all the people." It can be said that Li Lisan was one of the earliest proponents of the idea that the working class is the main force in economic construction. Practice has proven that his viewpoint is completely correct and has had a significant guiding role in the Chinese workers' movement. Over the past 40 years, the Chinese working class, with their firm political stance of loving the Party and socialism and their selfless, hardworking actions, have shown that they are indeed the main force in socialist construction. It is not an exaggeration to say that if we had not fully relied on the working class as the main force, it would have been impossible for our country to achieve such significant success. In recent years, the idea of fully relying on the working class has become diluted. A few people have even attempted to create a so-called "middle class" in China as their support base to subvert our country's socialist system. Practice has proven that we must not be ambiguous about this major issue concerning the position and role of the working class. The working class represents advanced productive forces and advanced production relations, possessing the advanced class characteristics that no other class can have, and representing the direction of human social development. If we want to build China into a modern socialist power, we must insist on the leading position of the working class and unshakably play the role of the main force of the working class. As the core of the new generation of the Party's leadership, Comrade Jiang Zemin has repeatedly emphasized the need to fully rely on the working class, which is completely correct and extremely important. When studying Comrade Jiang Zemin's speeches, linking them to Li Lisan's past relevant discussions, we cannot help but feel deep respect for this outstanding leader of the workers' movement.

Starting from the recognition of fully playing the role of the main force of the working class, Li Lisan paid great attention to the issue of democratic management in factories and enterprises. He believed that the enthusiasm and sense of ownership of the worker masses in production should be based on voluntary participation. To achieve this, it is necessary to democratize enterprise management, through democratic reform and improvement of the enterprise management system and production organization, to fully reflect and guarantee the status and rights of the worker masses as masters of the enterprise, so that the worker masses truly feel that they are the masters of the enterprise and consciously take an owner's attitude towards all the work of the enterprise. Based on the above understanding, Li Lisan proposed a series of specific views on how to rely on the worker masses to democratically manage the enterprise, which had a positive impact on the later practice of enterprise democratic management. He proposed that first, we should focus on the institutional construction of enterprise democratic management, that is, establish and connect the organizational forms and democratic channels for workers to participate in enterprise management. Especially in state-owned enterprises, in addition to establishing factory management committees with worker representatives, we should also establish the system of worker congresses and worker representative congresses, regularly organizing workers to discuss issues related to enterprise production and workers' living and welfare, and then concentrating the opinions of the masses for democratic discussion and decision-making by the factory management committee, and finally forming resolutions and management rules for implementation. Secondly, correctly handle the relationship between the administrative management organs of state-owned enterprises and the worker masses. On the one hand, the worker masses should voluntarily obey the leadership of the factory director, observe labor discipline, and do their own jobs well. On the other hand, the factory director and management personnel should establish the concept of the masses, follow the mass line, and consult with workers equally on all matters, relying on the masses to manage the enterprise well. Regarding the role of trade union organizations in promoting enterprise democratic management, Li Lisan also had many discussions. He believed that, on the one hand, we should improve the democratic life within the trade union through self-construction, relying on the masses to run the trade union; on the other hand, we must correctly handle the relationship between the trade union organization and the Party and administrative organizations, so that the trade union can boldly and responsibly carry out its work, exercise its powers, fulfill its duties, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of workers. Li Lisan's proposals and views have guiding significance for our current enterprise reform. He emphasized that socialized large-scale production cannot do without centralized command and the authority of managers. Our every enterprise must, through reform, establish a scientific management system and strict rules and regulations, which is undeniable. However, our enterprises are socialist enterprises and should reflect the status of the worker masses as masters of the enterprise. As managers of socialist enterprises, their management authority should not be based on opposition to the broad masses of workers, but should be based on relying on the masses, combining centralized command with democratic management. This is an important principle that we must firmly grasp in all enterprise reforms. The system of worker congresses in enterprises, which Li Lisan vigorously advocated, has been enriched and developed through long-term practice, proving that it is a good system and a good form of attracting the broad masses of workers to participate in enterprise democratic management, and should be seriously adhered to.

Li Lisan also paid great attention to the construction and improvement of the working class itself. He pointed out that the Chinese working class must, while transforming the entire society, transform itself. Without the high consciousness of the working class, it would be difficult to complete the construction tasks of New China. We must use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to educate workers, continuously raise their class consciousness, and gradually eliminate the various backward ideological consciousness used by the reactionary ruling class to corrupt and divide workers, such as feudal guild and factional thinking. He called on trade union organizations to carry out effective political education work, making the trade union a school of self-transformation for the working class, attracting and educating every worker to actively respond to and support the Party's various proposals and the government's calls, and making the broad masses of workers gradually cultivate collectivist organizational discipline and discipline through actively participating in various activities of the trade union, and in mass production practice, through learning and catching up with advanced labor competition activities, continuously improve their technical and operational skills. Li Lisan's discussions, if we review them today, can still provide us with enlightenment. Compared with the early days of national liberation, the working class in our country has become much stronger, and the level of consciousness and organization has also greatly improved. However, this does not mean that the issue of self-construction and improvement of the working class no longer exists. In the long process of building our country into a great modern socialist power, the Chinese working class must always place self-construction in an important position. The door of our country's opening to the outside world has been wide open. While we introduce advanced science and technology and excellent cultural and ideological achievements from abroad, various decadent things from the capitalist world will also take the opportunity to infiltrate. As the most advanced class in our country, the Chinese working class should continuously enhance its ability to discern and, with its advanced spiritual style, lead the whole society to resist the erosion of decadent thoughts. As for improving their own scientific and cultural quality and mastering modern science and technology, the tasks facing the Chinese working class are even more arduous. Therefore, the requirements that Li Lisan proposed to the broad masses of workers and trade union workers 40 years ago are still not outdated today. The Chinese working class and trade union organizations must make themselves more mature, stronger, and more closely united around the Party Central Committee, following the line indicated by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and better play the role of the main force in socialist modernization construction and reform and opening up, self-reliance, hard work, and make greater contributions to building socialism with Chinese characteristics and realizing the lofty ideals of the working class. This is the best way to commemorate Li Lisan.

　　发挥工人阶级的主力军作用
　　——纪念李立三同志诞辰90周年
　　钟公彦
    今年11月18日是李立三同志90周年诞辰。在缅怀这位无产阶级革命家和中国工人运动杰出领导人的时候，我们特别不能忘记的是他对中国工人运动和工会工作的发展所做的卓越贡献。在我们党建立初期，李立三同志就直接参与了工人运动的发动、组织和领导。他和刘少奇等同志领导的安源路矿工人大罢工，有力地推动了当时江西、湖南和全国的工人运动。他参与领导了震动中外的五卅运动和北伐战争中的武汉工人运动，为中国人民的反帝反封建斗争做出了很大贡献。新中国成立前夕，他根据党中央的指示参与主持了筹备恢复中华全国总工会的工作。1948年8月，在第六次全国劳动大会上，他当选为中华全国总工会副主席，负责主持全国总工会的日常工作，至1951年底。新中国的成立，标志着我国工人阶级的地位发生了根本变化，由被压迫、被奴役的阶级变成了国家的领导阶级。新历史条件下的工人运动应当沿着什么样的道路前进，是一个重大的新课题。李立三同志根据党中央的方针，为新中国工人运动的开拓做出了重要贡献。他倾心尽力地抓工会的组织建设，使全国职工很快地组织起来，工会各方面工作得以顺利地开展。他主持起草了《中华全国总工会章程》、《中华人民共和国工会法》和《中华人民共和国劳动保险条例》等重要文件和政策法令。与此同时，他在工运理论方面进行了认真的探索，提出了许多可贵的思想。他提出，中国工人阶级在取得国家政权之后，应责无旁贷地担负起建设新中国的艰巨重任并发挥模范的领导作用。他辩证地分析了国营企业中的矛盾，认为这里不再有阶级对抗与剥削，公与私的利益是完全一致的，企业中的党、政、工、团都应当首先强调这种一致性；但他又认为，公私利益之间也有具体矛盾，不应当忽视，而应当用兼顾的方针和协调的形式加以解决。他主张，工会应当首先把握住公私利益的一致性，不断教育工人提高觉悟，努力搞好生产，但又要多关心和代表工人的日常利益，切实履行维护职工利益的职能。他的这些思想，对我国工运理论建设起了很大的作用。从李立三同志关于必须紧密依靠工人阶级和发挥工人阶级在社会主义建设事业中的主力军作用的一些论述中，我们可以看到他的远见卓识。
    新中国成立前夕召开的党的七届二中全会明确提出，今后党的工作重心将由农村转向城市，在城市工作中必须全心全意依靠工人阶级。对于这个指导思想，当时并不是所有的同志都能深刻理解的。李立三同志结合工人运动和工会工作，对党中央提出的这个重要指导思想从理论上作了阐述，分析了工人阶级新的历史地位、作用和责任。在1949年7月召开的全国工会工作会议上，李立三同志就明确指出：“如果说，在战争时期，人民解放军是主力军，那么到了经济建设时期，工人阶级就应该是主力军了。我们工人阶级完全懂得，我们和过去其他任何统治阶级不同，过去封建阶级、官僚资产阶级取得了政权以后，他们是用剥削其他阶级压榨最大多数人民的办法，来供自己享乐的。工人阶级则不同，我们不能够也不应该取偿于其他人民，来使我们自己过较优裕的生活。我们工人阶级，只有全国人民得到了解放，自己才会解放，只有全国人民的生活都好起来了，自己的生活才会好起来，所以我们工人阶级要为解放全民族和全体人民的事业而奋斗到底”。可以说，李立三同志是相当早地提出工人阶级是经济建设主力军这一见解的人。实践证明他这个见解是完全正确的，对于我国工人运动有很大的指导作用。40年来，我国工人阶级以热爱党、热爱社会主义的坚定政治立场和大公无私、艰苦奋斗的实际行动，表明了自己确实是社会主义建设的主力军。可以毫不夸张地说，我们如果不是充分依靠了工人阶级这支主力军，我国要取得今天这样重大成就是根本不可能的。近些年来，全心全意依靠工人阶级的观念淡薄了。极少数人还企图在中国制造一个所谓的“中产阶级”作为他们的依靠力量，来颠覆我国的社会主义制度。实践证明，对这个关系工人阶级地位和作用的大是大非问题是万万含糊不得的。工人阶级是先进生产力和先进生产关系的代表，具有其他任何阶级都不可能具有的先进的阶级特性，代表着人类社会发展的方向。我们要想把中国建设成为一个现代化的社会主义强国，就必须坚持工人阶级的领导地位，坚定不移地发挥工人阶级的主力军作用。作为我们党新一代领导集体的核心的江泽民同志，多次明确提出必须全心全意依靠工人阶级，是完全正确和极为重要的。在学习江泽民同志讲话的时候，联系到李立三同志过去的有关论述，不由得使我们对这位工人运动的杰出领导人倍感敬佩。
    从充分发挥工人阶级的主力军作用这个认识出发，李立三同志很重视实现工厂企业的民主管理问题。他认为，工人群众从事生产的劳动热情和主人翁思想应当建立在自觉自愿的基础之上，要做到这一点，就必须实行企业管理的民主化，通过对企业管理制度和生产组织的民主改造和完善，充分体现和保障工人群众的主人翁地位和权利，使工人群众切实感受到自己是企业的主人，从而自觉地以主人翁的态度对待企业的一切工作。基于上述认识，李立三同志就如何依靠工人群众民主管理好企业，提出了一系列具体观点，这些对于后来的企业民主管理实践产生了积极的影响。他提出，首先应着眼于企业民主管理的制度建设，即建立和沟通职工参与企业管理的组织形式与民主渠道。尤其在国营企业，除建立有职工代表参加的工厂管理委员会以外，还应当建立职工代表会议和职工代表大会制度，定期就企业生产和职工生活福利等问题，组织职工开展讨论，然后集中群众的意见交由工厂管理委员会民主讨论决定，最后形成决议和管理规则贯彻落实。其次，正确处理好国营企业行政管理机构同职工群众的关系。一方面，职工群众应自觉服从行政厂长的领导，遵守劳动纪律，做好本职工作。另一方面，行政厂长和管理人员也要树立群众观念，走群众路线，遇事同工人平等商量，依靠群众办好企业。对于工会组织在推进企业民主管理中的作用，李立三同志也有不少论述。他认为，一方面应当通过自身建设完善工会内部的民主生活，依靠群众办工会；另一方面必须正确处理工会组织与党和行政组织之间的关系，使工会能够大胆负责地开展工作，行使自己的职权，履行自己的职责，维护职工的合法权益。李立三同志的这些主张和见解，对于我们今天的企业改革仍不失有指导意义。他强调，社会化的大生产，不能没有集中指挥，不能没有管理者的权威。我们的每个企业都要通过改革，建立起科学的管理系统和严格的规章制度，这是没有疑问的。但是，我们的企业是社会主义企业，应当体现出职工群众在企业中的主人翁地位。作为社会主义企业的管理者，它的管理权威不应当建立在与广大职工对立的基础上，而应当建立在依靠群众的基础上，应当把集中指挥和民主管理结合起来。这一条，是我们在企业的一切改革中都应该牢牢把握的一个重要原则。当年李立三同志大力提倡的企业职工代表大会制度，现在经过长期实践，有了很大的丰富和发展，证明了它是一个好制度，是吸引广大职工群众参加企业民主管理的好形式，应当认真坚持下去。
    李立三同志还十分注重工人阶级队伍自身的建设和提高。他指出，中国工人阶级要能担负起国家领导阶级的责任，就必须在改造整个社会的同时改造自己。如果没有工人阶级的高度觉悟，新中国建设任务的完成是很困难的。要用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想去教育工人，不断地提高他们的阶级觉悟，逐渐肃清反动统治阶级用以腐化和分裂工人的各种落后思想意识，如封建性的行会、帮口思想等。他号召工会组织通过开展卓有成效的政治教育工作，使工会成为工人阶级自我改造的共产主义学校，吸引和教育每个工人积极响应和支持党的各项主张和政府提出的号召，并使广大职工群众通过积极参加工会的各项活动以逐渐养成集体主义的组织性和纪律性，在群众性的生产实践中，通过学赶先进的劳动竞赛活动，不断提高自身的技术素质和操作技能。李立三同志的这些论述，我们今天重温一下，仍然可以从中得到教益。和全国解放初期比较起来，我国工人阶级队伍是壮大得多了，觉悟程度和组织程度也有了很大的提高。但是，这并不意味着工人阶级自身建设和提高这个课题已经不再存在了。在把我国建设成为伟大的现代化社会主义强国的长过程中，我国工人阶级必须始终把自身建设放在很重要的位置。我国对外开放之门已经大开，在我们引进国外先进科学技术和优秀文化思想成果的同时，资本主义世界的各种腐朽东西也会乘机侵入。作为最先进阶级的我国工人阶级，应当不断增强鉴别能力，用自己先进的精神风貌，带动全社会，抵制腐朽思想的侵蚀。至于在提高自身的科学文化素质，掌握现代化科学技术方面，我国工人阶级所面临的任务就更繁重了。所以，40年前李立三同志对广大职工和工会工作者所提出的那些要求，今天一点也没有过时。我国工人阶级和工会组织要使自己更加成熟，更加壮大，更加紧密地团结在党中央周围，沿着党的十一届三中全会以来所指引的路线，在社会主义现代化建设和改革开放中更好地发挥主力军的作用，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，为建设具有中国特色的社会主义，实现工人阶级的崇高理想做出更大的贡献。这样做，就是对李立三同志最好的纪念。
