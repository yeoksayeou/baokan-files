A breakthrough has been achieved in the development of antibiotic drugs in China. A new type of oral high-efficiency antibiotic with broad therapeutic effects on various human infections passed identification in Wuhan in late October. Experts believe that this type of drug has the potential to replace the older generation of antibiotics and become the primary anti-infection drug used in clinical settings by the end of the century.

The new drug, named Enoxacin by the Ministry of Health and also known as Flumequine, is a Class II new drug in China. It was developed by Wuhan Pharmaceutical Factory and the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 1986, Wuhan Pharmaceutical Factory broke away from the traditional manufacturing techniques for antibiotics and used chemical methods to synthesize oral tablets and capsules. These were clinically applied in seven major hospitals across the country, including the 302 Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, and Hubei Provincial People's Hospital. The overall effectiveness rate for treating infections of the digestive system, respiratory system, and urinary-genital system was over 95%. The effectiveness rate for treating secondary infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, as well as various stubborn infections of the biliary tract, skin, and soft tissues, was nearly 100%.

Clinical research also showed that this oral preparation had a higher bacterial clearance rate for human inflammation compared to other antibiotic drugs. The Shanghai Huashan Hospital Antibiotic Research Institute and the Shanghai Institute of Dermatology used this oral preparation to treat gonorrhea, and all 23 patients treated in one course of therapy were cured.

At the identification meeting, experts concluded that this new drug is significantly superior to commonly used antibiotics in China, such as ampicillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, and gentamicin.

    打破传统制作工艺  采用化学方法合成
    新型高效抗菌药通过鉴定
    经多家医院临床应用总有效率高于95％
    新华社武汉11月6日电  （记者熊金超）我国抗菌素药物的研制取得新的突破，一种对人体各类感染具有广泛疗效的新型口服高效抗菌药10月下旬在武汉通过鉴定。有关专家认为，这类药在本世纪末有可能取代老一代抗菌药而成为临床应用主要抗感染药物。
    已被卫生部命名为依诺沙星的这种新药，又名氟啶酸，属国家二类新药，是武汉制药厂和中国医学科学院生物技术研究所研制成功的。1986年武汉制药厂打破抗菌药物的传统制作工艺而利用化学方法合成的口服片剂和胶囊，经中国人民解放军302医院、北京协和医院、湖北省人民医院等全国七家大型医院临床应用，对治疗人体消化系统、呼吸系统、泌尿生殖系统感染的总有效率高于95％，治疗二类传染病伤寒及胆道、皮肤、软组织等多种感染顽症的有效率接近100％。
    临床研究还表明，这种口服制剂对人体炎症的细菌清除率也高于其他抗生素药物。上海华山医院抗生素研究所及上海皮肤病防治所将这种口服制剂试用于淋病，接受治疗的23名患者仅一个疗程即告痊愈。
    鉴定会上，有关专家认为，这种新药明显优于目前国内普遍采用的氨苄青霉素、红霉素、氯霉素、庆大霉素等抗菌药物。
