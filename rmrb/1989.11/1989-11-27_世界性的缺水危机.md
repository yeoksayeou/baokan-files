The 12th-century king of Sri Lanka, Parakramabahu the Great, instructed his water engineers: "Even the smallest amount of rainwater that falls should not be allowed to flow into the sea without benefiting people." Today, in many regions, Parakramabahu's words have largely been realized. Engineers have built thousands of dams, reservoirs, and thousands of irrigation canals to conserve water and, when necessary, transport it to where it is needed. For example, the Aswan High Dam in Egypt and the California Aqueduct have indeed made the desert bloom. However, due to human overuse of water resources, rivers have dried up, water levels have dropped, and lakes have shrunk, leading to regional water shortages worldwide. If water continues to be used without restraint, the water shortage situation will undoubtedly worsen. In areas with scarce water resources, between neighboring countries, within domestic regions, and between an increasing number of cities and farms, fierce competition is brewing.

Water is crucial in the Middle East

Egypt's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said: "The next war in our region will be over the waters of the Nile, not political struggles." The possibility of water conflicts sparking war is highest in the water-scarce Middle East. A quick glance at the geopolitical situation here will make this clear. The main water development activities in this region revolve around the Jordan River, the Tigris-Euphrates River, and the Nile River. Two of these rivers have almost reached their maximum water supply capacity. Coupled with the high population growth rates of some Middle Eastern countries and the severe dependence of food production on irrigation due to arid climates, the fear of water shortages is growing.

Israel, Jordan, and Syria mainly rely on the Jordan River for water. Israel recycles 95% of its water, primarily because since 1948, its irrigated area has expanded sixfold. Within 10 years, Israel's water supply will be short by 30%. Israel's population grows at a rate of 3.6% per year, making it one of the countries with the highest population growth rates in the world.

Jordan plans to increase its water demand by 50% by 2005. Some people are already talking about a water crisis occurring in the mid-1990s. Currently, both Israel and Jordan are considering reducing agricultural water use to meet household and industrial needs.

The Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip will also compete with Israelis for the dwindling groundwater. Due to excessive extraction of groundwater in the Gaza Strip, seawater intrusion has occurred, partially polluting this extremely important water source.

Tensions in the Tigris-Euphrates basin are also escalating. These two rivers originate in Turkey and flow through Syria and Iraq. Although this basin has abundant surplus water, Syria and Iraq will certainly be affected by Turkey's large-scale Anatolia Project, which aims to increase hydroelectric power and irrigation.

Egypt's Lifeline

Egypt receives very little rainfall, and its 55 million people almost entirely depend on the Nile River for water, none of which originates within its borders. The Blue Nile originates in Ethiopia, and the source of the White Nile system is Lake Victoria in Tanzania. Nine countries draw water from this basin. According to the 1959 agreement with Sudan (where the two Niles converge), Egypt is entitled to two-thirds of the water flowing into Aswan each year. However, upstream countries do not recognize any obligation to limit their use of the Nile River for the benefit of Egypt and Sudan. Indeed, Ethiopia's development plans could reduce the flow of the Blue Nile by 5.4 billion cubic meters at the Sudanese border, which would have disastrous consequences for downstream areas. Egypt's population increases by 1 million every nine months, raising the demand for drinking water and food, while Egypt has almost no other water sources to develop. Water shortages will inevitably threaten the production of food and economic crops, endangering Egypt's economic security.

The Water Cycle is Broken

The severe droughts of the mid-1980s made India's 835 million people acutely aware of the reality of water shortages. However, India's water problems are becoming more severe, due to both natural changes and poor management of land and water resources. In the late 1970s, the Indian government invested over $12 billion to build 1,554 large dams. However, deforestation has reduced the effectiveness of these projects. Streams and rivers that once flowed year-round are now dry for part of the year. Tens of thousands of villages in India are now facing water shortages, and the number is increasing.

Soviet Water Shortages

The Soviet Union has caused the largest ecological disaster by overusing water everywhere: the Aral Sea is shrinking. The fate of the Aral Sea also foreshadows the worsening water shortages in Central Asia, which could lead to serious economic losses and social problems. Central Asia is a rich source of fruits and vegetables for the Soviet Union. Its area accounts for only 7.3% of the Soviet Union's territory, but it produces one-third of the fruits, one-quarter of the vegetables, and 40% of the rice.

According to Philip Micklin, a Soviet water expert from Western Michigan University, "If preventive measures are not taken, the Aral Sea will shrink into a few remaining saltwater lakes by the next century." This will cause an ecological catastrophe, making the areas near the Aral Sea uninhabitable. To save the Aral Sea, agricultural water use must be reduced, but this will raise the question of how to provide food and employment for the rapidly growing population in this basin.

The list of water-scarce regions in the world is not complete just by adding the Soviet Union's Central Asia. To fully describe this situation, one must also include the Mississippi River basin, large parts of North and East Africa, the western United States, and small areas in Eastern Europe and Latin America.

Rational Use of Limited Water

In areas with rapid population growth, limiting the population seems to be the only way to meet the minimum per capita water demand, especially when they try to reduce their dependence on food imports. Additionally, by protecting natural resources, improving water use efficiency, and recycling more water, time can be gained to address urgent needs.

    世界性的缺水危机
    斯里兰卡12世纪时的国王帕拉克拉马·巴胡大帝为水利工程师规定：“哪怕是下雨降下的很少量的水也不能让它没有造福于人就白白流到海里去。”如今，在许多地区，帕拉克拉马的名言基本上实现了。工程师们建造了数千座水坝、水库和数千条分水运河，以保存水源，在必要时把它送到需要的地方去。例如，埃及的阿斯旺高水坝和加利福尼亚高架渠，确实使沙漠上开了花。但是，由于人类滥用了水资源，致使河流干涸，水位下降，湖泊缩小，全世界出现了地区性缺水现象。如果继续无节制地用水，缺水状况肯定会变得更严重。在水源匮乏的地方，在邻国之间，国内地区之间，以及在越来越多的城市和农场之间，正在酝酿着激烈的竞争。
    水在中东关系重大
    埃及负责外交事务的国务部长布·加利说：“我们地区的下一场战争将是争夺尼罗河水之战，而不是政治斗争。”争水的冲突会引发战火，这种可能性最大的地方莫过于缺水的中东了。只消看一下这里的地理政治形势就能很快明白这是为什么。这个地区水源开发活动的主干是约旦河、底格里斯—幼发拉底河和尼罗河。其中两条的供水量几乎扩大到了极限。加上中东一些国家的人口增长率高，而且气候干旱，粮食生产严重依赖灌溉，缺水的忧惧在日益增长。
    以色列、约旦和叙利亚主要从约旦河获得水。以色列使用的可回收的水已达95％，这主要是因为自1948年以来，它的灌溉面积扩大了6倍。10年之内，以色列的水的供应将短缺30％。而以色列人口每年增长3.6％，是世界上人口增长率最高的国家之一。
    约旦计划在2005年以前使用水需求增加50％。已有人在谈论它在90年代中期以前会发生水危机。现在，以色列和约旦都在考虑减少农业用水来满足家庭和工业的需要。
    西岸和加沙地带的巴勒斯坦人也一定会和以色列人争夺日益减少的地下水。由于加沙地带的地下蓄水抽取过度，已引起海水侵入，部分污染了这一极其重要的水源。
    底格里斯—幼发拉底河流域的紧张关系也在加剧。这两条河流发源于土耳其，流经叙利亚和伊拉克。尽管这一流域有大量过剩的水，但是叙利亚和伊拉克肯定会因土耳其大规模的安纳托利亚工程而受损失，这项工程旨在增加水力发电和灌溉。
                      埃及的生命线
    埃及极少下雨，5500万人民几乎全靠尼罗河水，而它的水源都不在本国境内。青尼罗河发源于埃塞俄比亚，白尼罗河水系的源头在坦桑尼亚的维多利亚湖。有9个国家从这个流域的水流中取水。根据1959年同苏丹（两条尼罗河在这里汇合）达成的协议，埃及每年有权用流入阿斯旺的水量的2／3。但上游国家不承认有义务为了埃及和苏丹的利益而限制使用尼罗河水。的确，埃塞俄比亚的开发计划，可能在苏丹边境把青尼罗河流量减少54亿立方米，这将给下游带来灾难性后果。埃及的人口每9个月跃增100万，使饮用水和粮食需求都提高了，而埃及几乎没有另外的水源可开发。缺水，势必危及粮食和经济作物的生产，这将威胁埃及的经济安全。
                    水文循环被打破
    80年代中期连续几年的干旱，使印度的8.35亿人民清楚地认识了水源缺乏的现实。但是印度水的问题日益严重，这既是由于大自然的变化无常，也是由于它的土地和水源的严重管理不善。印度政府在70年代末投资120多亿美元，兴建了1554座大水坝。然而，滥伐森林降低了这些工程的效益。一度终年有水的小溪和河流现在一年中有部分时间干涸了。印度有数万个村庄现在缺水，而且这样的村庄还在日益增多。
                    苏联的水量缩减
    苏联由于到处过度用水，已经造成了最大的生态灾难：咸海日益缩小。咸海的命运也预示着苏联中亚供水匮乏现象日益恶化，这可能带来严重的经济损失和社会问题。中亚是苏联的一个丰富的水果和蔬菜篮子。它的面积只占苏联领土的7.3％，但水果产量却占1／3，蔬菜占1／4，大米占40％。
    据西密歇根大学的苏联水源专家菲·米克林说：“如果不采取预防措施，下个世纪，咸海就会缩小成为几个残留的咸水湖。”这将造成生态浩劫，使邻近咸海的地区无法居住。要拯救咸海，就要求拨出农业用水，但是这样又会提出下面的问题，即：为这个盆地迅速增长的人口提供粮食和工作保障。
      世界缺水地区的名单，决不是加上苏联中亚就完全了。要全面说明这一情况，还必须包括墨西哥流域、北非和东非的很大部分地区、美国西部以及东欧和拉美的小块地区。
                    合理利用有限的水
    在人口增长速度快的地方，限制人口数目看来是满足最低人均需水量的唯一办法，尤其是在它们试图减少对粮食进口的依靠程度的时候。另外，通过保护自然资源、提高用水效率和回收更多的水，可以争取到迫切需要的时间。
