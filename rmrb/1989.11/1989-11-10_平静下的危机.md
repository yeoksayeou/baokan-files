After a sudden rainstorm, the Bay of Panama seemed even more tranquil. The sea water gently kissed the reefs beneath the seaside boulevard of Panama City, rolling up delicate waves. However, it is hard to predict when another surge of waves might rise.

When I arrived in Panama, I encountered just such a situation. On the surface, everything seemed calm, as if nothing had happened. Central Avenue was bustling with pedestrians and shoppers, and advertisements were everywhere. At night, the skyscrapers in the banking district were lit up with neon lights. The wealthy continued to indulge in luxury, frequenting high-end restaurants, bars, and casinos, spending money without a second thought. Even in the dilapidated, dark, and damp slums, the silhouettes of drunks could often be seen. It was hard to imagine that this was a country under martial law. On the very day I arrived in Panama City, the U.S. Southern Command deployed Marines, artillery, and helicopters for military exercises less than 30 kilometers from the city, disrupting civilian areas and the defense zones of the Panamanian Defense Forces. However, the authorities and the people had become accustomed to it and did not feel tense. The next day, Panama was back to normal: Children's Day, All Souls' Day, National Day (independence from Colombia), Flag Day, and Colón Day, five consecutive days of celebrations, which was surprising.

However, just as the surface of the Bay of Panama seemed calm, beneath this tranquility lay deep-seated crises. On November 2, the new U.S. chargé d'affaires, Bushnell, took office, claiming to be acting on special instructions from President Bush to "fully support the Panamanian people's struggle for democracy." Panama, however, declared that it did not recognize this representative of the White House. At the recent summit of American heads of state, Panama continued to be excluded, which also had a psychological impact on the nation. Due to continued U.S. sanctions, this country, which uses the U.S. dollar, is in a dire economic situation. The national finances are increasingly insufficient. Payments on foreign debts and interest have stopped, as have investments in basic construction and production. All efforts are focused on ensuring the salaries of government and state-owned enterprise employees and necessary daily expenses. Due to the paralysis of the construction industry, related industries such as steel, cement, building materials, and food processing have also been severely affected, leading to an 18% increase in unemployment; more than 42% of Panamanian families are below the official poverty line. The "state of war" declared earlier this month not only canceled citizens' rights to assemble, march, demonstrate, and strike but also stopped the issuance of wage increases and additional wages. To make up for the shortage of greenbacks (U.S. dollars), the government had to issue "vouchers" with fixed redemption dates. Economic Minister Gonzalez, with a touch of humor, pulled out a crumpled greenback from his pocket and said to me, "Such bills are still circulating only in Panama. Because we don't have our own currency."

The ongoing economic crisis is harming Panama. Health Minister Esquivel frankly told me, "The economic crisis is not visible on the streets but can be seen in the homes. Because there is nothing on the people's dining tables. Meals have been reduced from three to two, and some people even have only one meal a day." No one is satisfied with this situation. To be fair, there are those in the crowd who hate the Americans, and there are those who are dissatisfied with the authorities. Nationalism is not everything. General Torrijos left Panama with more than just the nationalist ideal of reclaiming the canal; he also left a legacy of populism, which can be seen as a Panamanian form of democracy. The two are not mutually replaceable. Interestingly, in the face of a strong enemy, various social and political forces within Panama have undergone a reconfiguration. Former allies have become opponents today; former opponents have become allies in the nationalist front, regardless of their motives, all rallying under the banner of reclaiming canal sovereignty. The recent coup was another form of reconfiguration. Since then, the Panamanian authorities, primarily General Noriega, have purged and cleaned up high-ranking military officers who were previously considered the "backbone" of the defense forces. In the implementation of the "state of war," there have also been disagreements among the highest authorities. However, ordinary people always consider and judge the essence of the problem in a more practical way. This is precisely the true crisis hidden beneath Panama's current calm. Various rumors, like the winds over the Bay of Panama, come and go; whether they foreshadow another storm is yet to be seen.

    平静下的危机
    本报记者　郭伟成
    一阵骤雨过后，巴波阿湾反而显得平静多了。海水轻吻着巴拿马城海滨大道下的礁石，卷起一道道细细的浪花。但是，很难预料什么时候又会掀起一阵阵惊涛骇浪。
    我到巴拿马，碰到的就是这样一种情势。表面上看，一切都很平静，似乎什么也没发生过。中央大道上熙熙攘攘，挤满了行人与顾客，各种各样的广告触目皆是，入夜，高楼林立的银行区，到处闪耀着五光十色的霓虹灯。有钱人照样纸醉金迷，出入于高级饭馆、酒吧、赌场，一掷千金，在所不惜。即使在破烂、阴暗、潮湿的贫民窟，也常闪过酒鬼的身影。很难想象这是一个实行着《战争法》的国家。就在我到达巴拿马城的那天，美军南方军还出动海军陆战队、炮车、直升机，在距离巴拿马城不到30公里处进行军事演习，骚扰巴拿马平民地带与巴拿马国防军的防地范围。只不过，当局与人们已经习以为常，并没引起紧张气氛。次日，巴拿马全国又是一派“升平”：儿童节、亡灵节、祖国日（独立于哥伦比亚）、国旗日、科隆节，连续5天，天天节日，令人吃惊。
    但是，一如表面上平息的巴波阿湾，在这平静下蕴藏着深刻的危机。11月2日，美国新任驻巴拿马代办布什内走马到任，声称奉布什总统特别指示，“全力支持巴拿马人民争取民主的斗争”云云。巴拿马则宣布不承认这位白宫代表。在不久前的美洲国家首脑会议上，巴拿马继续遭到排斥，也使国民遭到心理上的冲击。由于继续面临美国全面制裁，这个通用美钞的国家在经济上陷于极大的困境。国家财政日益入不敷出。停止了支付外债本息，停止了基本建设投资与生产投资，全力保证政府与国营企业职工工资的支出及必需的日常开支。由于建筑业的瘫痪，已经连带造成钢材、水泥、建材等相关工业、食品加工业的半停产，失业率上升18％；42％以上的巴拿马家庭陷于官方规定的贫困线以下。上月中旬开始实行的《战争法》，不但取消了公民集会、游行、示威与罢工的权利，也停止了职工工资升级与附加工资的发放。为了弥补绿票子（美钞）不足，政府不得不发行定期兑付的“代金券”。经济部长贡萨莱斯不无幽默地从笔挺的上衣口袋里掏出一张快要揉烂了的绿票子对我说：“这样的票子只有在巴拿马还在继续流通。因为我们没有本国的货币。”
    持续的经济危机损害着巴拿马。卫生部长埃斯基维尔坦率地对我说：“经济危机从街上看不出来，却可以从家里看出来。因为老百姓的饭桌上没东西。三餐改成两餐，一天一餐也大有人在”。没有人会满足于这种现状。平心而论，群众中既有恨美国佬的，也有对当局不满的。民族主义并不是一切。托里霍斯将军留给巴拿马人民的遗产，并不只是收回运河的民族主义理想，还有民众主义，不妨可以看作是巴拿马式的民主。两者是不可能互为替补的。有趣的是，面临强敌，巴拿马国内的各种社会与政治力量发生了重新组合。过去的同类，今天成了对手；倒是过去的对手，今天成为民族主义阵线中的盟友，无论出自何种目的，都集合到收回运河主权的大旗下。不久前发生的政变，是另一种方式的组合。从那以来，巴拿马当局，自然主要是诺列加将军对于过去一直被视为“中坚”的国防军中高级军官进行了整肃、清洗。在对于《战争法》的实施中，最高当局之间也发生过分歧。但是，普通群众总是以更为实际的方式来考虑与判断问题的实质。这也正是巴拿马今天平静的局势下掩盖着的真正危机。各种各样的谣言，像巴波阿湾上的风一样，时断时续；是否预示着远远地又会有风浪来到，还需要静静地观察。
