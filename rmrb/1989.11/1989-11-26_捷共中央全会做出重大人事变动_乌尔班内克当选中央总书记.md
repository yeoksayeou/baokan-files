The Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee Plenum made major personnel changes on November 24.

The General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Jakes, as well as all members of the Presidium and the Secretariat, collectively resigned. Karel Urbanek was elected as the new General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.

Karel Urbanek is 48 years old. He joined the Czechoslovak Communist Party in 1962, served as the First Secretary of the Brno City Committee in 1984, was elected as a member of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee in 1986, and became the head of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Political Organization Department in March 1988. In 1988, he was elected as a member of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Presidium and took on the role of chairman of the newly established Czechoslovak Republic Party Work Committee.

According to Urbanek's nomination, the Plenum elected 9 members of the Central Presidium, 4 alternate members, 6 Central Secretaries, and 9 members of the Secretariat.

The Plenum resolution stated that Czechoslovak society is in crisis, and further exacerbating social tensions would threaten socialism in Czechoslovakia.

The Plenum decided to propose an action program by mid-December at the latest, addressing the urgent issues of revitalizing socialism and reforming political, economic, and other aspects of social life.

The Plenum also decided that the Czechoslovak Communist Party would begin practical dialogue with all those who respect the Czechoslovak constitution.

The Plenum proposed reorganizing the federal and two national republic governments, increasing the number of representatives from other political parties and non-party members.

The Plenum reaffirmed that friendship, alliance, and cooperation with the Soviet Union remain the fundamental international guarantees for the development, security, and sovereignty of Czechoslovak socialism. Czechoslovakia will continue to be a steadfast and active member of the Warsaw Pact and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.

At the end of the Plenum, Urbanek delivered a speech, emphasizing the need to prove the party's sincerity in reform and democratization through action.

He said that the primary task is to quickly restore normal social life and creative, positive labor.

Urbanek expressed gratitude to Jakes, Husak, Indra, Adamets, Fojtik, and Hoffman for their past contributions to the party and society.
