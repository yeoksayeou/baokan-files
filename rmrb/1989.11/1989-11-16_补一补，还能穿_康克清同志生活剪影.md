One day, I had the chance to visit Kang Keqing's granddaughter, Zhu Xinhua, and saw several pieces of clothing covered in patches. Curious, I asked, "Whose are these?" "My grandmother's," she replied. I was astonished as I picked up the patched clothes. "Your grandmother's?" Zhu Xinhua's mother walked into the room. "Yes, they are your grandmother's. Don't believe it? Look, there are even more patched clothes. Here, I'm patching another one right now," she said, showing me the clothes she was working on.

Kang Keqing's daughter-in-law, Zhao Liping, had just completed her retirement procedures and was visiting her daughter in Beijing. Although she is an old revolutionary who joined the revolution during the War of Resistance Against Japan, she has a talent for sewing. Therefore, after moving to the city, the task of mending clothes for her in-laws fell to her. "I've been mending clothes for your grandfather and grandmother for 40 years."

Zhao Liping originally worked in Tianjin. During holidays and festivals, she would come to Beijing to visit her in-laws. During her short stays, she would always be busy mending clothes for the elderly couple. After Zhu De passed away, Kang Keqing handed over some old clothes to her daughter-in-law, asking her to alter them to fit her size. The cotton pants Kang Keqing wears now are made from Zhu De's old cotton pants. Zhao Liping said, "The cotton pants are so worn out, but your grandmother still can't bear to throw them away."

Kang Keqing has a few good outfits, which she only wears when meeting foreign guests or going abroad. In her daily life, her outfits are simple and made of ordinary fabric. Her undergarments are made from cotton cloth costing a few cents per yard. Some of her clothes have been washed from blue to gray and then to white, and she still wears them. Many of her clothes, after being worn for over a decade, are covered in patches. When washing them, she dares not scrub too hard or put them in the washing machine. Sometimes, Zhao Liping sees that the clothes her mother-in-law needs to mend are too worn out, and suggests making new ones. But Kang Keqing says, "It's a waste to throw them away; patch them up, and they can still be worn."

Xinhua continued, "A few years ago, when I was pregnant, I wore a blue cotton dress. Some colleagues asked, 'Where did you find such a worn-out dress?' I said it was my grandmother's. They looked at it in disbelief. Actually, that dress was borrowed from my grandmother, and now she still wears it!" Once, Zhao Liping saw that the middle of her mother-in-law's large bedsheet had several patches, so she bought a new one for her mother-in-law to use. The old bedsheet was altered into a single bedsheet and used on two small beds. Zhao Liping, who knows her mother-in-law's temper, said, "If the old bedsheet were thrown away or used as a cleaning cloth, she would definitely scold me."

Large patches, small patches, patches of the same color, patches of different colors—looking carefully at the pajamas Zhao Liping is mending, my eyes welled up with tears. "In recent years, the living standards of the people across the country have improved significantly. Now, except for impoverished mountainous areas, who still wears such patched clothes?" Zhao Liping nodded in agreement. After a while, she slowly said, "I can't remember how many years grandmother has been wearing this pajama. Look, the sleeves, hems, collars, back, and underarms all have patches."

Now, Zhao Liping is old, and her eyesight is failing, making it harder for her to do needlework. Last year, she brought her mother-in-law's old pajamas back to Tianjin to mend. One evening, an old classmate came to her house for something, saw her struggling to mend the patches, and sighed, "Why not buy some fabric and make a new one for Kang Keqing?" Zhao Liping said, "I've suggested it many times, but she just won't agree. I know that grandmother is not short of money to buy fabric; she and Zhu De have been living a frugal life for decades!" The old classmate said, "But after you mend it, it will tear again after wearing it once!" Zhao Liping thought about it and agreed, so she bought cotton fabric and made two new pajamas for her mother-in-law. However, when the clothes were sent to Beijing, Kang Keqing insisted on giving her daughter-in-law 30 yuan. She said to her daughter-in-law, "You have a hard time living alone." Zhao Liping refused to take the money. After pushing and pulling, the staff saw the situation and said to Kang Keqing, "Your daughter-in-law made you a set of clothes, which is a way of showing filial piety. How can there be a reason to give money?" Kang Keqing then took back the money.

In these years, Zhao Liping has never boasted about her in-laws' important positions in the Party and the state to others. Instead, she is proud that her in-laws have been living a simple and frugal life like ordinary people. Every time she comes to her mother-in-law's house, the staff will say to her, "Old Zhao, you're here to mend clothes again, right!" At this, she always smiles knowingly. On piece after piece of clothing, her meticulous and even stitches not only stitch in the filial piety of a daughter-in-law but also the deep respect of Chinese women for the older generation of revolutionaries.

Kang Keqing's daily meals are simple, and she never picks and chooses. During the Cultural Revolution, she took the bus to work. Once, she was accidentally pushed off the bus by the crowd and fractured her bones. In 1978, after becoming the chairperson of the All-China Women's Federation, the organization provided her with a dedicated car, but Kang Keqing did not want to trouble the driver. She would have lunch in the canteen and then rest briefly on a camp bed in the office before continuing her work. In recent years, Kang Keqing has grown old, and the staff often advise her to "improve her living conditions." Kang Keqing understands the good intentions of her comrades but remains as frugal as ever. She often says, "The country is so big; how can we manage without hard work and thrift?"

Why has Kang Keqing been living a clean and frugal life for decades? Recently, I happened to discuss Kang Keqing's letter to Zhu De on his 54th birthday. The letter reads: "I remember, more than a hundred miles from my home, the first time I saw you, I felt that you—the commander of the Red Army—were an extremely ordinary person, ordinary like a common farmer. At that time, I was very surprised. In fact, that was your great characteristic. ... I have been with you for more than a decade, and I feel that you always put the country and the revolution first, never considering your own interests. You can endure what others cannot, and you open up what others cannot do."

Although this letter was written 50 years ago, it still deeply moves people's hearts today! This passage is not only Kang Keqing's praise for Zhu De's noble character but also a reflection of her own ordinary life!

### “补一补，还能穿”——康克清同志生活剪影

    “补一补，还能穿”
    ——康克清同志生活剪影
    本报记者　赖仁琼
    一个偶然的机会，我在康克清的孙女朱新华家里看见几件缀满补丁的衣服，便好奇地问道：“谁的？”“我奶奶的。”拿起补丁衣，我惊讶不已：“你奶奶的？”新华的母亲闻声走进房间：“是她奶奶的，不信是吧？唉！还有比这更破的，这不，正补呢！”说完拿起正在补的衣服给我看。
    康大姐的儿媳赵力平刚办完离休手续来北京女儿家小住。她虽是位抗战时期参加革命的老干部，但却有一手好针线。因此，进城后，为公婆补衣服的任务责无旁贷地落在了她的身上。“算起来，我为新华的爷爷奶奶已补了40年衣服。”
    赵力平原在天津工作，逢年过节，便来北京看望公婆。小住一两日，总是忙着为两位老人缝缝补补。朱老总逝世后，康大姐把一些旧衣裤交给儿媳，嘱她按自己的身材改制。现在康大姐穿的那条棉裤，就是朱老总的旧棉裤改的。赵力平说：“棉裤都板了，但婆婆至今还舍不得扔掉。”
    康大姐有几套好外衣，一般只是会见外宾或出国访问时才穿。平日里，她穿的外衣式样和布料都极普通。内衣则都是用几角钱一尺的棉布缝制的。她的衣服，有的蓝衣洗成了灰衣服，最后又洗成了白衣服还在穿。不少衣服因穿了十几年，打的补丁又多，洗时不敢用劲儿搓，更不敢放到洗衣机里绞。有时，赵力平见婆婆要补的衣服实在太破，便提议做件新的。但康大姐却说：“扔了太可惜，补补还能穿一次。”
    新华接过妈妈的话茬说，前几年她怀孕时，穿了件蓝布衣，有的同事问：“从哪儿找这么件破衣服？”她说是奶奶的。人家瞪大眼睛看，满脸的不相信。新华说：“其实，那衣服是我向奶奶借的，后来还给她，现在她还穿呢！”一次，赵力平见婆婆的大床单中间已经打了好几个补丁，便买了条新的给婆婆铺上了。把那条旧床单改成单人的，铺在了两张小床上。熟悉婆婆脾气的赵力平说：“如果把旧床单扔掉或当了抹布，准得挨批评。”
    大补丁，小补丁，相同颜色的补丁，不同颜色的补丁，仔细翻看赵力平缝补的这件睡衣，我的眼睛湿润了：“这几年，全国人民生活水平有了很大提高。如今，除了贫困山区，谁还穿这样的补丁衣服呢？”赵力平赞同地点点头。少顷，她缓缓地说：“记不清婆婆这件睡衣已经穿了多少年，你看，袖口、下摆、衣领、后背、腋下，都已打过补丁。”
    如今，赵力平年纪大了，眼也花了，做针线越来越吃力。去年，她把婆婆的旧睡衣带回天津缝补。一天晚上，老同学有事找到家里，见她如此费劲在打补丁，感慨之余，便鼓动她买块布给康大姐做件新的。赵力平说：“我也说过多少次，但她就是不同意。我知道，婆婆并不缺这买布的钱，她和朱老总一样，几十年过惯了俭朴的生活！”老同学说：“可你补好后，穿一次又会再破洞呀！”赵力平一想也对，于是，便买棉布给婆婆做了两套新睡衣。谁知衣服送到北京，康大姐非得给儿媳30元钱不可。她对儿媳说：“你现在一个人生活不容易。”赵力平说什么也不收。两人推来让去，工作人员见此情景，便对康大姐说：“儿媳给您做套衣服，这是孝顺您，哪有给钱的道理？”康大姐这才把钱收回。
    这些年来，赵力平从不为有担任党和国家重要职务的公婆夸耀于人，相反，却为公公婆婆一直过普通人的俭朴生活而骄傲。她每次来婆婆家，工作人员就会对她说：“老赵，又来补衣服吧！”这时，她总是会意地笑笑。在一件又一件衣服上，她那细密匀实的针脚，不仅缝进了儿媳的一片孝心，也缝进了中国妇女对老一辈革命家的深深崇敬。
    康大姐平时吃饭很简单，从不挑这拣那。“文革”中，她挤公共汽车上下班。一次，不慎被拥挤的人流挤下车后摔成骨折。1978年担任全国妇联主席后，组织上为她配了专车，但康大姐不愿麻烦司机，中午就在食堂吃饭，然后在办公室的行军床上稍事休息便又接着工作。近年来，康大姐年事已高，工作人员见她生活过于节俭，便时常劝她“改善改善”。康大姐理解同志们的好心，但却依然一如往常。她常说：“国家这么大，不艰苦奋斗哪行？”
    康大姐为何几十年一直过着清廉、俭朴的生活呢？近日，偶尔谈到康大姐在朱老总54岁寿辰时写的一封信。信中写道：“我记得，在离开我家一百多里的地方，第一次看见你，使我觉得你——红军的总司令——是一个极平凡的人，平凡得像一般的农民一样。当时我很奇怪。其实那正是你伟大的特征。……我和你相处十多年了，觉得你无时不以国家、革命为重，凡事不顾自己的利害，人们不能忍受的事你能忍受，人们所不能干的事你去开辟。”
    这封信虽然写在50年前，但今天读来，仍深深打动着人们的心！这段文字既是康大姐对朱老总高尚品格的赞颂，也是她自己平凡生活的写照！
