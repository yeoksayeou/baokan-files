Japan's defense spending is set to exceed the limit once again. According to a report by Kyodo News, the Japanese Defense Agency revealed on the 2nd that this fiscal year (from April this year to March next year), Japan's defense spending will account for 1.022% of the 1989 national GDP, once again breaking the 1% limit.

The Defense Agency made this estimate based on the Cabinet's decision on the 2nd to raise the salaries of national public servants by 3.11%. Since members of the Self-Defense Forces are classified as national public servants, their salaries will increase, leading to an increase in this year's defense spending to 3.9813 trillion yen, an increase of 61.5 billion yen from the original plan.

    日本防卫费将再次突破限额
    据共同社报道，日本防卫厅二日透露，本年度（今年四月至明年三月）日本的防卫费将占一九八九年度国民生产总值百分之一点零二二，再次突破百分之一的限额。
    防卫厅是根据二日内阁会议作出的把国家公务员工资提高百分之三点一一的决定而作出上述估算的。日本自卫队员均为国家公务员，由于他们的薪水提高，本年度的防卫费因此将增加到三点九八一三万亿日元，比原计划增加六百一十五亿日元。
