The 44th session of the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child on November 20th.

The Convention on the Rights of the Child was drafted by the Human Rights Commission's working group after ten years of negotiations among many countries. The convention consists of 54 articles, stipulating that children, from birth, have the right to a name, nationality, survival, education, and protection from exploitation and abuse, among other rights. These rights are not affected by differences in the child's or their parents' race, gender, religion, or ethnicity.

The convention will enter into force after being ratified by 20 countries.
