Nicaragua's government and anti-government armed representatives began direct talks today at the United Nations headquarters to resolve their differences and restore the peace process in Central America.

The talks were held under the chairmanship of the International Support and Supervision Committee. The committee is composed of two secretaries-general from the United Nations and the Organization of American States. A representative from Honduras was invited to attend the talks as an observer because the bases of the Nicaraguan anti-government forces are located near the Honduran border, making Honduras relevant to the situation.

This is the first direct talk between the two sides since mid-1988.

Today's talks lasted until the evening, and there are still serious differences of opinion between the two sides. The talks will continue tomorrow and may be extended until the end of this weekend.

    尼加拉瓜双方开始直接会谈
    本报联合国11月9日电　记者刘开宸报道：尼加拉瓜政府与反政府武装代表今天下午在联合国总部开始直接会谈，以解决双方分歧，恢复中美洲和平进程。
    会谈是在国际支持与监督委员会主持下进行的。该委员会由联合国和美洲国家组织的两位秘书长等人组成。洪都拉斯代表以观察员身份应邀参加会谈，因为尼反政府武装的基地设在洪边境地区，与洪有关。
    这是自去年年中以来，尼双方第一次举行的直接会谈。
    今天会谈持续到晚上，双方意见仍有严重分歧。明天将继续会谈，可能延期到本周末结束。
