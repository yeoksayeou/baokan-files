	"Stepping out of the campus, understanding the national situation, and recognizing society." Nearly 10,000 students from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Tongji University, East China Normal University, and other institutions have actively participated in various forms of social practice activities by going deep into factories, rural areas, and communities. Recently, at a seminar on integrating professional theoretical learning with practice for university students, many student representatives reflected on the turmoil, deeply feeling that it is very necessary to learn about the national and social conditions through social practice.

	According to the agreement between the Shanghai Municipal Education Administration and the Procuratorate, the first batch of 200 undergraduate seniors and graduate students participating in the anti-corruption campaign came from the legal, economic, accounting, and auditing departments of Fudan University, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai University, and East China University of Political Science and Law. In early October, they went to the procuratorates and other departments in 11 districts including Jing'an, Huangpu, Luwan, and Xuhui, as well as Shanghai and Nanhui counties, to undergo training on the front lines of the fight against corruption. Some students said that through more than a month of practical case work, we have personally seen that the Party and the government are determined to tackle corruption and promote integrity. A graduate student from the Economics Department of Fudan University said that participating in the anti-corruption campaign has given us a good legal education.

	In September, 160 students from the 1986 class of the Shipbuilding and Ocean Engineering Department of Shanghai Jiaotong University went to the Jiangnan Shipyard for internships. There, they heard about the history of the development of China's shipbuilding industry over the past century, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, where the workers of Jiangnan Shipyard have worked hard to achieve the localization of technical equipment for 10,000-ton ocean-going ships, thus enabling China's shipbuilding industry to enter the international market. They were deeply inspired. A female student in the shipbuilding major said, "In the past, we always thought that university students working at the grassroots level were a bit of a waste of talent. Now we feel that there is a lot of room for us to contribute in enterprises." She expressed her desire to work hard for China's shipbuilding industry in the future.

	Recently, to discuss ways and methods to further improve the production internships for college students in the new situation, Shanghai Vice Mayor Xie Lijuan and other leaders visited Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, Shanghai No. 22 Cotton Mill, and Shanghai Yimin Food Factory, among other units. They are working to establish a number of relatively stable internship bases for mechanical, electrical, chemical, textile, and liberal arts students, and are studying and formulating relevant policies for mutual benefit between schools and factories to meet the needs of 51 colleges and universities in Shanghai for students to participate in social practice and production internships.

    走出校园　了解国情　认识社会
　　上海万名大学生积极参加社会实践
    新华社上海11月24日电　（记者刘军）“走出校园，了解国情，认识社会。”上海交大、复旦、同济、华东师大等高校的近万名大学生，纷纷深入工厂、农村、街道，开展多种形式的社会实践活动。日前，在大学生专业理论学习与实践相结合研讨会上，许多学生代表联系动乱进行反思，深感通过社会实践，补上了解国情民情这一课很有必要。
    经上海市教育行政部门和检察部门商定，首批参加廉政肃贪工作的200名本科毕业班学生和研究生，来自复旦大学、上海财经大学、上海大学和华东政法学院的法律、经济和会计、审计专业。10月初，他们来到静安、黄浦、卢湾、徐汇等11个区和上海、南汇两个县的检察院等部门，在反贪污受贿的斗争第一线经受锻炼。有些大学生说，通过一个多月的办案实践，我们亲眼看到了党和政府是下大决心、花大力气抓廉政肃贪工作的。复旦大学经济系一名研究生说，参加肃贪工作，我们受到了一次很好的法制教育。
    上海交通大学船舶工程及海洋系86级的160名学生，9月份到上海江南造船厂实习。他们在那里听到了有关我国造船工业近百年来发展的历史，尤其是党的十一届三中全会以来，江南造船厂职工艰苦创业，实现万吨远洋巨轮技术装备国产化，从而使我国造船工业跻身于国际市场的事迹，深受鼓舞。船舶专业一名女学生说，过去我们总觉得大学生到基层工作有点大材小用，现在觉得在企业同样大有用武之地。她表示将来要脚踏实地为我国造船工业奉献自己的力量。
    最近，为探讨在新形势下进一步搞好高校学生生产实习的途径和方法，上海市副市长谢丽娟等负责人走访了上海柴油机厂、上海国棉二十二厂、上海益民食品厂等单位，着手建立一批机、电、化、纺等理工科和文科学生相对稳定的实习基地，并研究制订有关学校与工厂互惠互利的政策，以满足上海51所高校学生参加社会实践和生产实习的需要。
