The largest nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in the U.S. Navy, the "Abraham Lincoln," was commissioned on November 11 at the Norfolk Naval Base in Virginia.

This is the most advanced aircraft carrier currently in the U.S. Navy, with a displacement of 100,000 tons and a length of 1,092 feet, making it the largest warship ever built by the United States.

The "Abraham Lincoln" is the fifth ship of the Nimitz-class nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. During its construction, lessons learned from previous battles were incorporated, and its armor protection has been further improved.

The ship's air defense weapons include the "Sparrow" ship-to-air missiles and the Phalanx Close-In Weapons System.
