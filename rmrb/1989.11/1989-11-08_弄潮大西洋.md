We Chase History

Fuzhou's Mawei Port, a historic port that Chinese people take pride in. As early as the Ming Dynasty's Yongle era (1405 AD), Zheng He set sail from here, leading a fleet of 62 ships and 27,800 people, heading towards the world. This marked a glorious chapter in the history of global navigation and Sino-foreign exchanges.

In the blink of an eye, 580 years have passed.

On March 10, 1985, Mawei Port celebrated another grand occasion, a solemn moment that will be recorded in history. In the water, 13 ships flew the five-star red flag, adorned with red and green decorations, ready to set sail. Over 200 heroes gathered on the deck, gazing deeply at their country and loved ones. On the shore, officials from relevant departments, reporters from various newspapers, and thousands of local residents came to see them off. They would set sail from here, following the routes opened by their ancestors, through the South China Sea, the Malacca Strait, the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea, crossing the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean, entering the Atlantic Ocean, going further than Zheng He, to create a business that our ancestors had never ventured into...

At this moment, Zhang Yanjie, the general manager of the China Fisheries Association, sitting on the stage, was overcome with emotion. This was the first time his fleet was embarking on a distant voyage. For over 30 years since the founding of the nation, our fishing boats had been circling around our doorstep, never stepping out of the country. Zhang Yanjie, a "veteran fisherman" who graduated from the Shanghai Fisheries College in 1959 and had been working in the national fisheries department, had seen the words "developing our distant fishing industry" on the recruitment brochures in the 1950s. However, 30 years later, this industry was still a blank. The rapid population growth, coupled with overfishing and environmental pollution, had made our coastal fisheries increasingly scarce, even in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, it was difficult to supply decent fish. The "veteran fisherman" felt both ashamed and frustrated! He dreamt of the day when... Until after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the tide of reform and opening up surged, breaking open the rusty, creaking doors that had been closed for too long, and the Chinese people's vision finally opened up! The Party Central Committee and the State Council cared for the marine fisheries. After years of material preparation and strict personnel training and selection, the Fisheries Association borrowed 3 million US dollars in foreign exchange and invested 35 million yuan, and now, China's first distant ocean fishing fleet was finally established. For this voyage, the company equipped the fleet with satellite navigation and communication equipment, hired a captain and a telegraph operator from the China Ocean Shipping Company to assist, and chose the "golden season" of March to April when the Indian Ocean had smaller waves. However, the domestically produced fishing vessels had not experienced distant ocean waves, and our "local bosses" and crew members had never been on a distant voyage. Could they successfully pass through five barriers and three oceans? It was still uncertain...

On the command ship "Hai Feng 824," the brave crew members gathered around a tall man from Shandong—Lü Hongtao, the fleet commander, temporary party secretary, and deputy general manager of the company. Before this, he had already carried a small abacus three times to the Atlantic coast for inspections, conducted rigorous demonstrations and a series of talks, and signed a series of agreements with relevant countries, laying the foundation for the distant voyage. However, the heavens are unpredictable, and this person, who graduated from an accounting school and could calculate faster than a computer, still could not foresee everything. When the fleet gathered, his close partner, General Manager Zhang Yanjie, visited every ship, toasting the departing crew, wishing them a smooth journey. They shook hands tightly. "Boss Lü, I'm entrusting these 13 ships and over 200 people to you!" Lü Hongtao knew the weight of these words. "You'll see, I'll get it done for you!" He signed a military order and added, "But I also hope you can understand..." Zhang Yanjie, of course, understood what he was going to say next, so he deliberately put on a light smile: "Everything is difficult at the beginning. The gold in foreign countries isn't just waiting for you to pick up. I don't ask you to make money right away, as long as you arrive safely, establish a foothold, and open up the situation, that's a victory!"

...At 10 o'clock sharp, "The first distant ocean fishing fleet of China, now sets sail!" Mawei Port instantly erupted in excitement, with drums and firecrackers, and the sirens of 13 fishing boats roared towards the sky, slowly leaving the shore. At this moment, Lü Hongtao on the ship and Zhang Yanjie on the shore both had tears streaming down their faces. Despite their orders: "Don't cry!" the dock was still filled with sobs. The voyagers couldn't help but miss their homes? On the shore, there were elderly parents, wives, and children, and there were fisherwomen who had promised their lives but had not yet been married. Saying goodbye, they left them behind. If this journey was successful, they would have to wait two years to return home. But if it was not successful? No one dared to think about it... The sending-off relatives couldn't help but worry and strain their eyes. In the past, you went out to sea to fish, and you would be back in ten days or half a month. The family's hearts were still hanging in the air, but now... This time, they were going ten thousand miles away, and they would be separated for two years. Take care of yourselves!

The fleet braved the wind and waves out of the Min River estuary, heading south through the Taiwan Strait. This was the same path that Zheng He had taken. Zheng He's voyages were half a century earlier than Columbus of the West, but our fishing boats' distant voyages were nearly half a century later than developed countries. Following the routes opened by Zheng He, we chased history...

Passing Through Five Barriers and Three Oceans

Twelve fishing boats followed "Hai Feng" forward, and on the vast Pacific Ocean, it was like a flock of blue-gray geese flying over.

Suddenly, one fishing boat fell behind, spinning in the whirlpool, and a distress call came over the high-frequency radio: "Hai Feng, Hai Feng, this is ×! Our main engine has failed, requesting to anchor for repairs!"

This heart-wrenching call startled Lü Hongtao: How could there be a problem just after leaving home? In this vast ocean with no villages or stores in sight, anchoring? No, it couldn't be abandoned, and the fleet couldn't stop! He discussed with the captain and immediately decided: "×! Hai Feng will tow you along, repair while moving!"

"Right full rudder!" "Reverse!" In the tossing waves, "Hai Feng" approached the ship. Sailors ran and shouted, throwing ropes, tightly connecting the two ships. They urgently repaired. "Hai Feng" opened full throttle and continued leading the southbound flock.

The fleet passed through Singapore and entered the "throat" of the Malacca Strait between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The terrain here is complex, the channels are narrow, and the climate changes frequently. For thousands of years, how many boats and fishermen have disappeared here! Now, it happened to be a time of thunderstorms and heavy rain. The strait was like a boiling pot. Our fleet navigated through the water path blocked by rain and floating objects, with all crew members focused and holding their breath, carefully avoiding the "one-tiao shallow reef" hidden underwater that had caused many ships to wreck, as if brushing past the grim reaper!

The road is long, and the night is long. The fleet headed west in the Indian Ocean... In front was Sri Lanka...

Beijing. At two o'clock in the morning, an urgent phone call woke Zhang Yanjie. "Lü Hongtao is on the line!" The telegraph operator urgently said, "The fleet has encountered an emergency at longitude ×, latitude ×, a crew member has acute appendicitis!" Zhang Yanjie's head buzzed. He was most worried about the fleet encountering disasters at sea! "Immediately reply, ordering them to rush to Colombo for rescue!" "But the fleet is still a day's journey from Colombo, the surgery must be performed immediately! Lü is preparing for the ship's doctor to perform emergency treatment, believing that Dr. Li has the confidence! We will try not to stop in Colombo, and when refueling and taking on water in Aden, we will perform surgery on the patient for a check-up. This can avoid delaying the entire fleet's schedule and save a sum of foreign exchange. Please instruct!" Zhang Yanjie wiped the cold sweat from his face, and his hanging heart only relaxed a little: This bold and careful Lü! "Reply, agreed! Ask him to handle it at his discretion!"

Under the dark night of the Indian Ocean, "Hai Feng 824" and "Yan Yu 618" docked, and the ship's doctor Li Wenshen quickly jumped over, transferring the patient with a twisted abdomen and a waxy face to the command ship for emergency rescue. Li Wenshen was the only doctor on the fleet, leaving behind a sick wife at home, embarking on the journey. The sudden emergency presented him with a difficult problem: to perform surgery, the ship's medical equipment and conditions were too primitive, but it had to be successful, not allowed to fail, his life was tied to the safety of the entire team!

Commander Lü Hongtao's heart was also in his throat. He, of course, understood: if his decision was wrong, it would mean what, and how would he explain it to the patient's family and the general manager? But time! Time is also life! The fleet must rush across the Indian Ocean before the monsoon arrives, which concerns the safety of the entire fleet. If the maiden voyage fails, it will inevitably dampen morale and cause a setback, and our distant fishing industry will be delayed for who knows how many years!

...Finally, the surgery was successful, the patient was saved, and Lü Hongtao's decision won in the face of danger! The fleet refueled and took on water without delay and, at the end of Zheng He's voyage to the Western Ocean, left the dimly lit port of Aden, crossing the calm and red-hued Red Sea, heading for the port of Tawfiq, preparing to pass through the Suez Canal.

The Suez Canal is the best waterway between the East and West, and for over 100 years of navigation, it has brought convenience to passing ships and benefits to the host country! The canal authorities stipulate: passing ships must submit an application to cross the canal 5 days in advance and declare the arrival time, ship length, weight, and draft, and accept measurement and calculation methods higher than international conventions, charging according to the "Suez Canal tonnage." If not in accordance with the rules, you can be made to wait for 3 months! Lü Hongtao was well-prepared for this and passed through one barrier after another smoothly.

On April 15, the fleet passed through the Suez Canal and then crossed the foggy, windy, and wavy Mediterranean. On the night of April 25, they braved the 10-level waves of the Strait of Gibraltar, known as the "Stormy Mouth," and entered the long-awaited Atlantic Ocean. The destination, the Spanish Canary Islands' Las Palmas, was in sight!

This is a famous free port, a gathering and tourist destination for maritime trade among the five continents, and also a battlefield for distant fishing industries of developed countries and regions, known as the "world's fish bank." Soviet, Japanese, South Korean... fishing boats gathered, mostly large ships. Our ships in this line were inferior. Yes, we were not as good as others, but we would not always be like this; yes, we started too late, others had been "roaming" on the sea for decades, and we hurriedly came to join the "late meeting." But we finally came. Yesterday, there were 23 countries in the world with distant ocean fisheries, and today, there were 24, the Chinese had reported in!

On the "Hai Feng" ship, Lü Hongtao, with his Shandong accent, called out to his comrades: "'Big Ghost,' 'Second Ghost,' 'Sea Bumpers'! Don't be like Lady Liu entering the Grand View Garden, all of you change into suits, Chinese people, cheer up, let the foreigners have a good look!"

He looked at his watch, subtracting 7 hours of time difference, it was now 1 AM on April 29 in Beijing time—a moment to be remembered forever. China's first distant ocean fishing fleet, after traveling 1100 nautical miles and 50 days, finally arrived in Las Palmas as planned before May 1st!

Everything is difficult at the beginning

They only rested for a week in the picturesque Las Palmas, repainted the ship's body that had been eroded by seawater and "horse teeth," and then set off for Senegal and Guinea-Bissau. They were not here to travel and sightsee; they were burdened with a debt of 3 million US dollars and had to catch fish and sell it here to earn foreign exchange and transport fish back to the country.

On May 20, the fishing boats went to sea. This was the first net cast by Chinese fishing boats in the Atlantic Ocean, ending the era of Chinese people fishing and shrimp in their doorstep. What a great Atlantic Ocean! Every net was not empty, with jack mackerel, grouper, tuna, red snapper... jumping onto the ship, the Chinese crew was intoxicated! But according to the cooperation agreement, the participating black crew members gestured: No, the fish is too small, quickly throw it back into the sea! What? Throwing gold into the sea, are you crazy? We fishermen would rather eat snapper than yellow croaker, grouper can be served at the state banquet! Too small? A 12-centimeter red snapper is still small? In our place, it would be in high demand! Under the equatorial sun, enduring 40-50°C high temperatures, working hard for 3 days, the ship was already full, one trip was 170 tons, exceeding the monthly production of the country. Returning, selling fish on shore! The shore was lively. Foreign crew members, local residents, and international fishermen were all waiting for the Chinese harvest. But when the fish was unloaded, the fishermen shook their heads: No! The fish is too small, it can't be sold! "Local bosses" and crew members were desperate to cry. No! This is our blood and sweat, gold in hand, do we really have to throw it back into the sea? Persuading the fishermen to take the larger ones, the remaining smaller ones were all sold to the fishmeal factory, only 4 fen per kilogram in RMB! Thinking of the difficulty of eating fish in the country, and such good fish here could only be treated as waste, it broke the hearts of these sea adventurers! But what could they do? In such hot weather, the fish would quickly spoil, if not "processed," it would have to be thrown away as garbage! Throwing it into the sea would pollute the water and incur fines!

Hard work, exhaustion, and loss of capital. Unfamiliar with the place, eyes wide open. At home for a thousand days, difficult for a moment away. The Chinese were "stranded," foreign fishermen technologically blocked us, they were unwilling to tell us the situation of the fishing grounds and markets, unwilling to transfer any technical materials, and even refused to sell us a map, fearing we would take their business. Fellows are enemies.

We could only "feel our way across the river." The "local boss" took the translator, carrying a camera, entered a local fish processing plant's cold storage room. In name, it was "visiting," but in reality, it was checking the "household registration" of the fish. The fish in the Atlantic Ocean looked strange, we didn't recognize them, and we didn't know what they were called locally. —"Take a photo to remember," quietly inquire: What are these called? What is the price? Which varieties are most popular? What size of fish meets the specifications? Using this crude method, we established our first "West African fish archive."

With the "photo album" of the fish, they went to sea again, "following the map." But strangely! Those "named" fish still couldn't be caught. Why? The fishing grounds were wrong. The places where we fished had small waves and no reefs, but we couldn't catch big fish. The places with big fish had many reefs, and we couldn't go. Our signature skill was "double tow"—two ships towing one net, inflexible operation, most afraid of hitting reefs; others were "single tow"—one ship towing one or even two nets, freely maneuvering in the sea, catching big squid, big jack mackerel, and big grouper... In adversity, we changed, "double tow" to single tow. Imitating others, the production plummeted, and accidents occurred frequently. The local joint-venture boss began to waver, he spent 4,000 US dollars to hire a French captain to command our production. The French captain swaggered onto the Chinese ship, he ordered—he actually ordered the Chinese captain to step down!

What? What?! The "local boss" was furious. This is a Chinese ship, not stepping down, absolutely not stepping down! You're just afraid I'll learn your technology, right? Well, I'd rather not enter the cabin, work as a sailor on the ship, but I won't leave my own ship!

The "local boss" was wronged, losing command on his own ship! But he did not give up the captain's responsibility, nor forget the mission of the motherland. He stood on the deck, the equatorial sun burned his skin to a copper color, shining brightly, like a copper statue. He held a map made from a map, on which the fishing grounds we urgently needed to master were not marked. He was isolated from the cabin, unable to hear the French captain's orders, and could only closely watch the ship's direction, judging the position according to the latitude and longitude on the map. Every net caught what fish in what place, all marked. With the eyesight and confidence of a sea adventurer, he silently guessed the map in the French captain's hands, feeling his way through the sea, measuring the Atlantic Ocean inch by inch, drawing the map we urgently needed stroke by stroke, enduring humiliation, eating bitterness, waiting for the day to show his skills and turn defeat into victory!

The hearts of all crew members were tightly connected to the "local boss," holding back this breath, now it was truly "all in the same boat"!

"At home," Zhang Yanjie exchanged letters with Lü Hongtao every month, each letter was dozens of pages thick, like an endless "love letter." There was so much separation and longing, and so much deep affection for their shared cause! The Atlantic Ocean connected Beijing...

Salute, Sea Adventurers

1985-1989, 4 years have passed. These were the first 4 years of China's distant ocean fishing industry's arduous creation.

Now, in the office of the general manager of the China Fisheries Association, Zhang Yanjie and several other deputy general managers—the first generation to fill the gap in China's distant ocean fishing industry, a close-knit collective—are chatting and laughing with visitors. The globe in his hand spins under his fingers, like a familiar toy. He pointed to the blue sea, as if reciting from memory, talking non-stop...

Our "Boss Lü" has been stationed in West Africa for 4 years. In the past 4 years, we have sent 5 batches of ships, 34 in total, plus those outside the company, there are 50. Now, not only West Africa, but also the South Pacific and North and South America have our distant fishing teams, with nearly 100 fishing boats and 2,000 crew members and land personnel, even reaching the doorsteps of the Soviet Union and the United States to catch fish, which was unimaginable in the past! Our total catch is 100,000 tons per year, opening up the Japanese and European markets, not to mention the foreign exchange earned by the country, just the fish goods we returned to the country in the past 4 years reached 5,300 tons, supplying Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and the Old Mountain front...

General Manager Zhang reviewed the road of creation, envisioned the grand blueprint, and his expression was filled with pride and also contained hardship. He repeatedly emphasized: When you reporters and writers tell the story of "us fishermen" in literary language, you must not forget that our distant ocean fishing ships set sail with the tide of reform and opening up, and the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and many departments have given care and support. Many old comrades have pushed the waves and made arduous efforts.

To create this industry, in the past 4 years, we have lost two crew members who gave their precious lives. They struggled on the ship until their deaths. They never returned to the motherland in their lifetimes, never saw their loved ones who were in their dreams and longing eyes. They died with the smell of fish on their bodies, and the sea wind and waves gave them a solemn baptism. Their remains were buried on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. "Green mountains everywhere bury loyal bones, why must we return in horse leather?" Their tombstones are the monuments of China's distant ocean fishing history. During festivals and holidays, our "local bosses" and "sea bumps" would come to the graves of their fallen comrades, pouring out their hearts. Fellow countrymen coming from the mainland would also come to their spirits, offering a bouquet of flowers and a piece of sorrow.

Salute, the sea adventurers of the times, the pioneers of China's distant ocean fishing industry! The tide is rising, the fishing boats on the Atlantic Ocean are setting sail again...

    弄潮大西洋
    霍达
    我们追赶历史
    福州马尾港，中国人引以自豪的历史名港。
    早在明永乐三年（公元1405年），郑和就是从这里启航，率领由62艘船、27800人组成的船队，浩浩荡荡走向世界，在世界航海史和中外交往史上谱写了光辉的篇章。
    弹指一挥间，580年过去了。
    1985年3月10日，马尾港又在度过一个盛大节日、一个将载入史册的庄严时刻。水中，13艘船高扬着五星红旗，披红挂绿，整装待发。200多名壮士齐集甲板，向着祖国和亲人深情地注目；岸上，有关部门的负责人、各报记者以及当地群众上千人，为他们送行。他们将从这里出发，沿着祖先开辟的航道，经过南中国海、马六甲海峡、阿拉伯海、红海，穿越苏伊士运河和地中海，进入大西洋，比郑和走得更远，去开创一项我们的前人所未曾涉足的事业……
    此刻，坐在主席台上的中国水产联合总公司的总经理张延喜心潮难平。这是他麾下的船队首次远航。建国30多年来，我们的渔船一直在家门口打转转，始终没有走出国门一步。张延喜这个1959年毕业于上海水产学院后一直在国家水产部门工作的“老水产”，早在50年代就在招生简章上看到“发展我国远渔事业”的词句，可是30年之后这项事业还是一项空白。人口的迅速增长加之竭泽而渔和环境污染，使我国沿海的渔业资源日益贫乏，连京、津、沪都难以供应像样的鱼了。“老水产”既惭愧，又憋气！他梦想着有一天……直到中共十一届三中全会之后，改革开放的大潮汹涌而起，冲开了因关闭太久而锈迹斑斑、“嘎吱”乱响的大门，中国人的眼前才豁然开朗！党中央、国务院关怀着海洋渔业，经过数年的物质准备和严格的人员培训、挑选，水产总公司贷款300万美元外汇额度、总投资3500万元人民币，现在，中国开天辟地第一支远洋渔业船队终于成立了。为了这次远航，总公司为船队装备了卫星导航和联络设备，聘请了中国远洋运输公司的一位船长和一位电报员协助工作，并且选择了3至4月印度洋风浪较小的“黄金季节”。但是，国产的渔轮没有经过远洋的风浪，我们的“土老大”和船员没有出过远门，能不能顺利地过五关，闯三洋？还凶吉未卜……
    船队的指挥船“海丰824”号上，剽悍的船员们簇拥着一位山东大汉——船队的总指挥、临时党委书记、公司副总经理吕洪涛。在此之前，他已经怀揣着小算盘3次到大西洋沿岸考察，经过严谨的论证和一连串会谈，和有关国家签订了一系列协议，为远航打下了基础。但是，天有不测风云，这个毕业于会计学校、打算盘比计算机还快的人仍然难以预料一切。船队集合时，他的亲密搭档、总经理张延喜走遍了每一条船，向远行的人敬酒，祝他们一帆风顺。紧紧地握手。“吕老板，我把这13条船、200多口子人，都交给你了！”吕洪涛知道这句话的分量。“你看着吧，我会给你办好的！”他立下了军令状，又补充了一句：“不过，也希望你能理解……”张延喜当然理解他下面要说什么，就故意做出轻松的微笑：“万事开头难。外国的黄金不是等着你去捡，我不求你马上赚回钱来，只要平安到达、站住脚跟、打开局面就是胜利！”
    ……10时整。“中国第一支远洋渔业船队，现在启航！”马尾港顿时沸腾起来，锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣，13艘渔船的汽笛仰天长啸，缓缓离岸。这时，船上的吕洪涛、岸上的张延喜都热泪纵横。尽管他们下了命令：“不许哭！”但码头上仍然哭声一片。远航的人能不恋家吗？岸上有白发苍苍的爹娘、妻子儿女，有订了终身还未曾迎娶的渔家妹子，说声走，就扔下他们，走了。如果此行顺利，也要等两年之后才能回家。但如果不顺利呢？谁也不敢想了……。送行的亲人能不把心儿操碎、双眼望穿吗？往日你们出海打鱼，十天半个月就回来，家里人的心还悬在半空，而如今……此去万里，一别两年，多多保重啊！
    船队顶着风浪驶出闽江口，向南穿越台湾海峡，这正是当年郑和走过的路。郑和航海比西方的哥伦布早了大半个世纪，我们的渔船远航却比发达国家晚了近半个世纪。沿着郑和开辟的航道，我们追赶历史……
    过五关、闯三洋
    12艘渔船紧跟着“海丰”前进，浩瀚的太平洋上，犹如飞过一行蓝灰色的雁阵。
    突然，一艘渔船掉队了，在漩涡中原地打转，高频电话中传来紧急呼叫：“海丰，海丰，我是×号！我船主机发生故障，请求抛锚修理！”
    这揪心的呼叫使吕洪涛一惊：怎么刚出了家门口就出了问题？在这前不着村后不着店的大海上，抛锚？不，决不能丢下它，船队也不能停！他和船长交换了意见，当即决定：“×号！海丰拖着你走，边走边修！”
    “右满舵！”“倒车！”在巨浪的颠簸中，“海丰”向那艘船靠拢。水手们奔跑着、呼喊着，抛过缆绳，把两只船紧紧地连接起来。紧张地抢修。“海丰”开足马力，又率领南飞的雁阵继续上路了。
    船队经过新加坡，进入太平洋和印度洋之间的“咽喉”马六甲海峡。这里地形复杂、航道狭窄、气候变化反复无常，千百年来曾有多少渡舟渔人一去不回！现在，正赶上雷雨交加，海峡好似一锅沸水。我船队在雨幕和漂浮物封锁的水路上摸索前进，全体船员凝神专注，屏息静气，在“海丰”的指挥下，小心翼翼地绕过潜藏在水中、曾使许多船只遭难的“一拓浅滩”，仿佛与死神擦肩而过！
    路漫漫，夜漫漫。船队在印度洋上向西，向西，前面就是斯里兰卡……
    北京。夜里两点钟，紧急的电话铃声把张延喜震醒。“吕洪涛同志来电！”电报员急切地说，“船队在东经×度、北纬×度出现意外，一位船员患急性阑尾炎！”张延喜的脑袋嗡地一声，他最担心的就是船队在海上突遇天灾人祸！“立即复电，命令他们立即向科伦坡靠岸抢救！”“可是，船队距科伦坡还有一天的路程，手术必须马上进行！吕总准备请随船医生作应急处理，相信李大夫有这个把握！争取不在科伦坡靠岸，坚持到亚丁港加油加水时再上岸对病人作手术后检查。这样可以避免耽误整个船队的行程，又可以节省一笔外汇开支。请您指示！”张延喜抹了抹脸上的冷汗，悬着的心才放下了一半：这个胆大心细的老吕啊！“复电，同意！请他随机应变，全权处理！”
    夜幕沉沉的印度洋上，“海丰824”和“烟渔618”靠帮，随船医生李文臣一个箭步跳过船去，把腹如刀绞、面色蜡黄的病人转移到指挥船上，投入紧急的抢救。李文臣是船队仅有的一名医生，家里丢下患病的妻子，踏上了征途。突发的意外给他出了一道难题：要做手术，船上的医疗设备和条件太简陋了，但只能成功，不许失败，他一身系全队安危！
    总指挥吕洪涛的心也提到嗓子眼儿，他当然明白：一旦他的决策失误，将意味着什么，该怎么向病人家属和张总交待？但是，时间哪！时间也是生命！船队必须抢在季风到来之前渡过印度洋，这关系到整个船队的安危。如果首航失利，势必使士气受挫、一蹶不振，我们的远渔起步不知又要推迟多少年！
    ……终于，手术成功了，病人得救了，吕洪涛的决策于险中取胜！船队加足了油、水，没有耽搁，在郑和下西洋的终点，又挥师向北，离开了灯火迷离的亚丁港，穿越海平如镜、水似丹霞的红海，驶向陶菲亚港，准备通过苏伊士运河。
    苏伊士运河是世界东、西方之间的一条最佳水上捷径，它通航100多年来，给过往船只带来多少方便，又为东道主带来多少好处！运河当局规定：过往船只必须提前5天提出过河申请并报明到港时间及船只长度、重量、吃水深度，并且要接受高于国际惯例的丈量、计算方法，依“苏伊士运河吨位”收费。不合规矩，可以让你等3个月！对此，吕洪涛早有准备，一关一关顺利通过。
    4月15日，船队通过苏伊士运河，进而穿越大雾弥漫、风高浪急的地中海，4月25日半夜闯过素有“风暴口”之称、正掀起10级风浪的直布罗陀海峡，驶入朝思暮想的大西洋，目的地西属加那利群岛的拉斯帕耳马斯港已遥遥在望！
    这是一个闻名于世的自由港，五大洲海上贸易的集散地和旅游胜地，也是发达国家和地区远渔事业争雄逐鹿的战场，有“世界鱼库”之称。苏联、日本、南朝鲜……的渔轮云集，多是艨艟巨轮。我们的船走在这行列中，相形见绌。是的，我们不如人家，但我们不会永远这样；是的，我们起步太晚了，人家在海上“闯荡”了几十年之后，我们才匆匆忙忙地来赶了个“晚集”。但是，我们终于来了。昨天，世界上远洋渔业国家还是23个，今天，就变成24个了，中国人赶来报到了！
    “海丰”船上，吕洪涛扯开山东好汉的大嗓门儿，用闯海人的土话呼叫着他的伙伴儿：“‘大鬼’、‘二鬼’、‘海碰子’们！别这么像刘姥姥进大观园似的，都给我换上西服，中国人打起精神来，让外国人好好儿地瞧瞧！”
    他抬起腕子看了看表，扣除7个小时的时差，现在是北京时间4月29日凌晨1时——一个永志难忘的时刻，中国第一支远洋渔业船队经过1100海里、历时50天的跋涉，终于按原定计划赶在“五·一”之前胜利抵达拉斯帕耳马斯！
    万事开头难
    他们在风光旖旎的拉斯帕耳马斯只用了一个星期稍事休整，把被海水和“马牙子”剥蚀的船体油饰一新，便分赴塞内加尔、几内亚比绍站。他们不是来旅游观光的，他们身负着300万美元的债务，要在这里捕鱼、销售以换取外汇，并且为国内运回鱼货。
    5月20日，渔船下海了。这是有史以来中国渔船在大西洋上撒下的第一网，它结束了中国人一直在家门口打鱼摸虾的时代。好一个大西洋！网网不空，加吉鱼、石斑鱼、鲐鱼、红鲷鱼……欢跳着被拉上了船，中国船员陶醉了！可是，根据合作协定参加我们作业的黑人船员比划着说：不行，这鱼太小，赶快扔回海里去！什么？到手的黄金往海里扔，疯了？我们渔民宁吃鲷鱼不吃黄鱼，石斑鱼能上国宴！太小？12厘米的红鲷还小？在我们那里上市要排大队！在赤道烈日下忍着40—50℃的高温，苦干了3天，船已经装满了，一个航次就是170多吨，超过了国内一个月的产量。返航，上岸卖鱼去！岸上好热闹。外国船员、当地居民、国际渔商都在等着中国人的收获。但是，鱼一上岸，渔商直摇头：不要！这鱼太小，根本卖不出去！“土老大”和船员们急得要哭。不要！这是我们的血汗，捡到手的金子，难道真的要扔回海里吗？死说活说，求渔商把大的挑走，剩下小的都卖给了鱼粉厂，每公斤只合人民币4分钱！一想到国内的人“吃鱼难”，而这么好的鱼在这里却只能当废品“处理”，心疼死这些闯海人了！但又有什么办法呢？这么热的天儿，鱼很快就变质，不“处理”只好当垃圾扔掉了！扔进海里污染海水还要罚款！
    苦死，累死，老本赔死。人生地不熟，两眼一抹黑。在家千日好，出外一时难。中国人“搁浅”了，外国渔商对我们技术封锁，他们不肯告诉我们渔场、市场的情况，不肯转让任何技术资料，甚至连一张海图也不肯卖给我们，怕我们抢他们的生意。同行是冤家。
    我们只有“摸着石头过河”。“土老大”带着翻译，背着照相机进了一家当地的鱼类加工厂的冷冻车间。名义上是“参观”，实际上是查鱼的“户口”。大西洋里的鱼，模样儿长得怪，咱认不全，也不知道在当地叫什么名儿。——“拍照留念”，悄悄地打听：这都叫什么鱼？什么价钱？哪些品种最受欢迎？多大的鱼方符合规格？用这种土办法，建立了我们手中的第一份西非鱼“档案”。
    带着鱼的“相册”又下了海，“按图索骥”。但是，奇怪！那些“榜上有名”的鱼还是打不到。为什么？渔场不对。我们打鱼的地方，风浪小、海底无礁石，但打不到大鱼。大鱼多的地方礁石也多，我们去不了。我们的看家本领是“双拖”——两条船拖一张网，运转不灵，最怕触礁；人家是“单拖”——一条船拖一张网甚至两张网，在海里游刃有余，打上来的尽是大墨斗、大加吉鱼和大石斑……穷则思变，“双拖”改单拖。东施效颦，邯郸学步。产量急剧下跌，事故不断发生。当地合资的老板对我们发生了动摇，他花了4000美元雇了个法国船长来指挥我们的生产。法国船长大摇大摆地上了中国船，他命令——他竟然命令中国船长下去！
    什么？什么？！“土老大”火了。这是中国的船，不下，就是不下！你不就是怕我学了你的技术吗？好吧，我宁可不进驾驶室，在船上当水手也不离开自己的船！
    委屈了“土老大”，在自己的船上失去了指挥权！但是，他没有放弃船长的责任，没有忘记祖国的使命。他站在甲板上，赤道的烈日把皮肉晒成了古铜色，闪闪发光，犹如一尊铜像。他手里拿着一张用地图改造的海图，上面并没有标明我们最需要掌握的渔场。他被隔离在驾驶室外，听不见法国船长的舵令，只能紧盯着船的走向，依据海图上的经纬线判断方位。每一网在什么地方打上来什么鱼，都画上标记。他以闯海人的眼力和自信，默默地揣摸着驾驶室中那张拿在法国船长手里的海图，隔皮猜瓜，大海捞针，一寸一寸地丈量着大西洋水，一笔一画地绘制我们急需的海图，忍着屈辱，卧薪尝胆，等待着大显身手、转败为胜的那一天！
    全体船员的心都紧紧连着“土老大”，憋足了这口气，现在才是真正的“同舟共济”！
    “家里”，张延喜每个月都要和吕洪涛鱼雁往还，每封信都厚达几十页，像倾诉不尽的“情书”。这里有多少离情别绪，又有多少深深眷恋他们共同事业的痴情！大西洋水连着北京……
    致敬，弄潮儿
    1985—1989，4年过去了。这是我国远洋渔业艰苦创业的最初4年。
    现在，在中国水产联合总公司总经理办公室里，张延喜和另外几位副总经理——填补我国远洋渔业空白的第一代人、一个亲密团结的集体——一起和来访者谈笑风生。地球仪在他手指拨弄下旋转，像个得心应手的玩具。他指点着那蔚蓝色的海水，如数家珍，滔滔不绝……
    我们的“吕老板”坐阵西非已经4年了。4年来，我们先后派去5批船，34艘，加上总公司以外的，有50艘了。如今，不仅西非，在南太平洋和北美、南美都有我们的远洋渔队，共有渔船近百艘、船员和陆地人员2000名，甚至开到了苏联、美国的家门口去捕鱼，这在过去是不可想象的！我们的总捕捞量年产10万吨，打开了日本和欧洲的销路，为国家创汇不说，仅我们总公司4年来运回国内的鱼货一项就达5300吨，供应京、津、沪以及老山前线……
      张总经理回顾创业之路，瞻望远大宏图，神色中洋溢着自豪，也蕴含着艰辛。他一再强调：在你们这些记者、作家用文学语言讲述“我们这些打鱼摸虾的人”的故事时，一定不要忘了，我们的远洋渔船是凭借改革开放的大潮启航的，党中央、国务院和许多部门给予了关怀和支持，许多老同志推波助澜，付出了艰苦的努力。
    为了开创这一事业，4年来，我们有两位船员献出了宝贵的生命。他们在船上一直拚搏到死。他们至死都没能回到祖国，没能看一眼梦魂萦绕、望眼欲穿的亲人。他们死后仍然一身的鱼腥味儿，海风和巨浪为他们作庄严的洗礼。他们的遗体被安葬在大西洋岸。“青山处处埋忠骨，何必马革裹尸还？”他们的墓碑，是中国远洋渔业史的丰碑。逢年过节，我们的“土老大”和“海碰子”们都要来到亡友的墓前，一诉衷肠。从国内来的同胞，也总要来到他们的灵前献上一束献花、一片哀思。
    致敬，时代的弄潮儿、中国远洋渔业的开拓者！涨潮了，大西洋上的打鱼船又出发了……
