The sixth Men's Volleyball World Cup began today at the Osaka Castle Gymnasium. Cuba defeated Brazil 3-0 (16-14, 15-5, 15-9), the Soviet Union defeated the United States 3-2 (16-14, 5-15, 15-11, 4-15, 15-13), Italy defeated Cameroon 3-0 (15-2, 15-1, 15-4), and South Korea defeated Japan 3-2 (11-15, 7-15, 16-14, 15-12, 17-15).

The Soviet and US teams both have most of their players standing around 2 meters tall, capable of both height and speed. The US men's volleyball team, despite the retirement of two key players, still has considerable strength. The fifth set was the most intense. After a 13-13 tie, the Soviet team scored two points with a spike and a block to secure the final victory. The match lasted two hours. The US team's loss may ultimately cost them the chance to win the World Cup "three-peat."

The South Korean and Japanese teams' 135-minute marathon match saw Japan win the first two sets, while South Korea fought back to win the next two. In the fifth set, the score was tied at 4-4 and then 15-15. South Korea then scored two consecutive points.

    世界杯男排赛首日重头戏
    苏联队3∶2险胜美国队
    本报东京11月17日电　记者于青报道：第六届世界杯男排赛今天在大阪城体育馆拉开战幕。古巴队3∶0（16∶14、15∶5、15∶9）胜巴西队，苏联队3∶2（16∶14、5∶15、15∶11、4∶15、15∶13）胜美国队，意大利队3∶0（15∶2、15∶1、15∶4）胜喀麦隆队，南朝鲜队3∶2（11∶15、7∶15、16∶14、15∶12、17∶15）胜日本队。
    苏美两队多数队员身高都在2米左右，能高能快。美国男排在两名主力队员引退后，仍相当有实力。第五局的争夺最为激烈。13平后，苏联队一扣一拦得2分，才取得最后胜利。比赛进行了两个小时。美国队的失利，可能最终失去了夺得世界杯赛“三连冠”的机会。
    南朝鲜队与日本队135分钟的持久战，日本队先胜两局，南朝鲜队扳回两局。第五局从4平打到15平，南朝鲜队连拿两分。
