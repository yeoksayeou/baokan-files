With the conclusion of the Asian Athletics Championships, the major sports events in Asia for this year are nearing their end, leaving only a few events such as cycling and women's football.

This year, more than ten Asian championships or cup competitions were held, with the majority taking place in China. Asian athletes used these events as warm-up matches for the Asian Games next year, gaining a better understanding of each other's strengths.

Chinese athletes secured 49 gold medals in various Asian competitions this year (excluding non-Asian Games projects), primarily in athletics (22 medals), rowing (7 medals), weightlifting (8 medals), fencing (5 medals), and sailing (4 medals).

South Korea, a major rival of Chinese sports, won 41 gold medals. Their strongest events include weightlifting (13 medals), boxing (8 medals), fencing (5 medals), and tennis (4 medals).

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, an emerging force in Asian sports, also performed well, winning 14 gold medals in various Asian competitions, with 9 of them in weightlifting alone. If the gold medals of North and South Korea are combined, they would surpass the number of gold medals won by Chinese athletes.

Japanese athletes, however, only won 4 first places in this year's Asian competitions, failing to reflect the true strength of this veteran Asian sports powerhouse.

It should be noted that the 11th Asian Games will feature 27 major events, nearly half of which did not have Asian competitions this year. Therefore, predicting the outcome of next year's Asian Games based solely on this year's gold medal statistics is incomplete and inaccurate.

However, through the series of Asian competitions and other international events held this year, the strength of Chinese athletes, who have undergone adjustments after the Olympics, has been tested. It also reveals some new trends in Asian sports. In summary, the current situation in Asian sports is as follows:

1. Chinese athletes still hold the leading position in terms of overall strength in Asia. In particular, the rise of swimming has given China an advantage in the three major events (athletics, swimming, and shooting) with over 40 gold medals in next year's Asian Games. Although there was no Asian Swimming Championships this year, based on the results of the Pan Pacific Championships and other events, Chinese swimmers have achieved better results in Asia than Japanese athletes in 5 more events. Out of 31 swimming events, China currently leads in at least 16, and with diving and water polo's 9 events, the advantage is even greater.

In the recently concluded Asian Athletics Championships, Chinese athletes won more gold medals than expected, accounting for more than half of the total, indicating that China's leading position in Asian athletics has been further consolidated.

In shooting, Asian marksmen did not have a comprehensive showdown this year. Based on the results of the Asian Championships last year, Chinese shooters have a slight advantage.

2. The level of other Asian sports powers is rapidly improving, posing a threat to some of China's traditional strong events. Weightlifting, especially light-weight categories, has always been a strong point for China. However, Chinese athletes are increasingly feeling the challenge from the North Korean and South Korean teams. If the Chinese team did not send their top athletes to the Asian Weightlifting Championships this year, the third-place finish in gold medals is not convincing. However, in the world championships in Greece, the Chinese team sent their best athletes, but still lost the team total to the North Korean team. We must admit that our progress is not as fast as theirs, and we cannot be complacent.

The Asian Cup Table Tennis Championships were held in Beijing in May, and the Chinese team did not win a single men's or women's singles title, which has never happened in previous editions. As for badminton, the recently concluded World Cup clearly shows that the dominance of Chinese players in the badminton world has been replaced by a new format of multiple strong contenders.

In addition, some of China's weaker events, such as boxing, men's judo, archery, wrestling, football, tennis, and men's volleyball, have not seen significant breakthroughs this year. The advantage in these events continues to be held by South Korean and Japanese athletes.

Looking back at this year and forward to next year, Chinese athletes face a situation that is both bright and challenging, with many favorable conditions but also many difficulties. People hope that Chinese athletes will position themselves correctly, train with higher standards this winter, strive for the first place in gold medals and total points in the Asian Games, and fully demonstrate the spirit of the Chinese people who are not afraid of difficulties, unwilling to fall behind, and strive to advance.

### 形势逼人　快马加鞭——从一系列热身赛看亚洲体坛力量对比

　　形势逼人　快马加鞭
　　——从一系列热身赛看亚洲体坛力量对比
　　本报记者　刘小明
    随着亚洲田径锦标赛的落幕，今年亚洲体坛的重要赛事已接近尾声，只剩下自行车、女子足球等少数几项比赛。
    今年亚洲10余项洲锦标赛或杯赛，大部分在我国举行。亚洲体育健儿把这些赛事作为明年亚运会的热身赛，互相摸了底。
    我国运动员在今年亚洲一系列比赛中获得49枚金牌（非亚运会项目除外），主要集中在田径（22枚）、赛艇（7枚）、举重（8枚）、击剑（5枚）、帆船
  （4枚）等项目。
    中国体育的劲敌南朝鲜共获41枚金牌，他们夺金牌较多的项目有举重（13枚）、拳击（8枚）、击剑（5枚）、网球（4枚）等。
    亚洲体坛“黑马”朝鲜民主主义人民共和国运动员成绩也不错，在亚洲各项比赛中获14枚金牌，仅举重一项就拿了
  9枚金牌。如果把朝鲜北南双方运动员的金牌加在一起，就要超过中国运动员。
    日本选手在今年的亚洲比赛中，只获4项第一，远没有反映出这个老牌亚洲体育强国的真正实力。
    应当指出的是，第11届亚运会共有27个大项目比赛，其中近一半项目今年没有举行亚洲比赛。因此若以今年的金牌统计数字预测明年亚运会，显然是很不完全和不准确的。
    不过通过今年举行的一系列亚洲比赛和其它国际大赛，对奥运会后经过调整的中国体育健儿的实力，毕竟是作了检验，同时也使人看到亚洲体坛的一些新动向。概括起来说，当前亚洲体坛总的形势是：
    一、中国运动员总体实力仍居亚洲首位。特别是由于游泳的崛起，使中国在明年亚运会三个40枚金牌以上大项（田径、游泳、射击）都或多或少占有优势。游泳项目今年虽未举行亚洲锦标赛，但从泛太平洋锦标赛等赛事成绩看，中国选手今年创亚洲最好成绩的项目比日本多5项。游泳31个小项，目前中国至少有16项占上风，加上跳水、水球9个小项目，优势还要大。
      在刚结束的亚洲田径锦标赛上，中国选手的金牌数比预想的要多，占总数一半以上，这表明我国田径在亚洲领先的地位进一步得到巩固。
    射击，今年亚洲神枪手未作全面较量，以去年亚洲锦标赛成绩衡量，中国射手稍占上风。
    二、亚洲体育其它几强的水平提高势头很猛，中国一些传统优势项目受到威胁。举重，尤其是轻级别举重，历来是中国的强项。然而现在我国大力士越来越感到朝鲜队和南朝鲜队的挑战。如果说今年亚洲举重锦标赛中国队未派一流强手参加，金牌位居第3的名次不足为凭，那么在希腊的世界大赛上，中国队尽遣好手上阵，团体总分仍输给朝鲜队。必须承认我们进步不如人家快，不能自我满足了。
    亚洲杯乒乓球赛5月在北京举行，男女单打冠军中国队一个没拿到，这是前几届从未有过的。至于羽毛球，几天前结束的世界杯赛清楚地表明，中国选手独霸羽坛的局面已被多强抗衡的新格局取代。
    此外，我国的一些落后项目，如拳击、男子柔道、射箭、摔跤、足球、网球、男排等，今年仍没有出现大的突破。这些项目的优势继续保持在南朝鲜、日本运动员手中。
    回顾今年，展望明年，中国体育健儿面临形势既有光明的一面，又有亟待解决的问题，有利条件不少，困难也颇多。人们希望中国运动员摆正位置，以更高的标准投入冬训，争取在亚运会上获得金牌和总分第一，同时在竞技场上充分体现出中国人民不畏困难，不甘落后，力争上游的奋进精神。
