The Bay Islands have arrived. The propeller plane cannot fly high, which is good because from the plane, you can see the calm and transparent waters of the Caribbean Sea beneath, with the dark coral reefs. The sea water changes color in a wondrous way according to the density and height of the coral reefs: gem-like blue; jade-green; then from deep green to light green, surging onto the white sandy beaches, surrounding the lush green islands.

The Bay Islands are located in the western Caribbean Sea and are a province of Honduras. They include Roatán, Utila, and Guanaja, three slightly larger islands with inhabitants, as well as several smaller islands. The largest, Roatán, is long and slender, like a shuttlecock; it is over 30 nautical miles long from east to west and only 3 to 4 nautical miles from north to south. Upon arriving there, I discovered a peculiar phenomenon: the sea water was as still as a pond, and only when looking towards the horizon could one see a fine line of white waves. The ecologist Roberti on Roatán Island solved the mystery for me. It turns out that the Bay Islands are surrounded by extremely rich coral reefs; in particular, the barrier reefs north of Roatán Island block the tides. This coral reef extends several miles into the sea and then suddenly drops, forming a deep ravine. Therefore, only a fine line of waves forms there; then it rises again, forming another coral barrier, extending all the way to the deep sea 18 nautical miles away. It is said that this coral reef extends northward to the coast of Belize, making it the second-largest coral reef in the world, second only to the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia. It also concentrates various types of coral found in the Caribbean Sea. Coral not only serves as a barrier for the islands but also provides an ideal habitat for the survival and reproduction of fish. There are over a hundred species of fish near the Bay Islands, and about twenty of them live among the corals. Some fish species even rely entirely on these dense corals to reproduce their offspring.

On the western beach of Roatán Island, I got a glimpse of this wondrous underwater ecosystem. From the shore, it looked like a stretch of snow-white, fine sand. The sea water was clear and transparent, and standing in water up to my shoulders, I could still see the color of my toes and the floating sand grains. I tried throwing a coin into the water, and just as people say, I could see which side of the coin was facing up. Here, there's no need to wear a diving mask or carry an oxygen tank like professional divers. All you need is a simple diving mask and a snorkel, and you can swim out about 30 meters to see the wondrous underwater world: fan-shaped, spherical, antler-like, and chrysanthemum-like corals of various kinds, with tropical fish swimming among them; long, flat, with colorful edges, striped with black and yellow, covered with black and red patterns or spots. I was truly astonished and wished I could turn into a fish to swim with these little creatures into the depths of the sea.

Morning mist lingers among the palm trees, gradually dissipating. The rooster crows, birds chirp, frogs croak, and cicadas sing, creating a morning symphony. The sea water, like the previous evening, remains as still as a pond, gently kissing the white sand. The purple morning glories on the shore, emerging from somewhere, entwine with each other, vying to spread towards the sea, as if yearning for the sea's kiss. The palm trees grow right to the shore, exposing their sturdy roots, carelessly scattering coconuts on the ground, which dry up and are left unattended. Even now, the Bay Islands retain their original natural scenery. It is said that the landscape here is not much different from what Columbus's fleet saw over 400 years ago.

Since the 16th century, English, French, and Dutch pirates have occupied the Bay Islands, attacking Spanish colonial ships carrying treasures from Central America to Havana. In 1782, the Spanish concentrated their forces and eliminated the pirate strongholds on the islands. Later, the British brought slaves to the islands, and the Spanish again launched an attack, sending the slaves to Cuba. At that time, the Spanish thought the islands were uninhabited. In fact, many pirates had fled into the primitive forests with their families; many slaves also hid in the mountains, living by gathering wild fruits and hunting, and thus multiplying. These islands became a paradise for blacks, mixed-race people, and the descendants of white pirates. To this day, the islanders still speak English with an accent said to be from the 18th century, of course, they also speak Spanish. The names of the places on the island, whether old or new, are all named in English. The population is sparse, and the houses are very scattered. Deep in the palm groves or by the bay, there are wooden stilt houses, somewhat like the villages of some ethnic minorities in southern China.

In the past, the islanders mainly engaged in fishing and a few in farming. Now, many have turned to the tourism service industry. Last year, the Inter-American Development Bank assisted Honduras in building an airport runway and a main road on the largest island of Roatán, facilitating the development of tourism. The island of Roatán, with only 20,000 local residents, received over 20,000 tourists! The most popular tourist activities are diving to observe the underwater ecosystem, sport fishing, and hiking to the primitive forest for adventure. However, to this day, most islanders still make a living from marine fisheries. The entire island has 300 fishing boats of various sizes, mainly catching shrimp and lobster; the government only regulates the closed season for shrimp; since lobster is a migratory resource, only lobsters smaller than 4 inches are prohibited from being caught. There are three seafood freezing processing plants on the island. I visited the largest one, "Blue Water." During the peak season, even on Sundays, the workshop is still operating. Workers clean the shrimp purchased from fishermen, sort them by size through an automatic sorting machine, and then package and freeze them. Lobsters are sorted by hand and also packaged and frozen by size. This factory has 160 workers, processing 20,000 pounds of shrimp per day, freezing and packaging them, and then directly shipping them to Florida, USA, in refrigerated ships to exchange for foreign currency. Half of it is exchanged for local currency by the government, and the other half is retained by the enterprise. The Bay Islands, due to their geographical advantages, continuously receive marine wealth bestowed by nature.

    洪都拉斯巴亚群岛纪行

              奇妙的海底生态
    巴亚群岛到了。螺旋桨飞机爬不高，倒也好，从飞机上就可以看到平静而透明的加勒比海水下那黑黑的珊瑚礁。海水随着珊瑚礁的密集程度与不同高度而奇妙地变换着色彩：宝石般的蓝；翡翠似的绿；然后从深绿到浅绿，涌上白色的沙滩，环绕着座座葱茏的小岛。
    巴亚群岛座落在西加勒比海，是洪都拉斯的一个省，包括罗亚坦、乌提拉、瓜纳哈3座稍大一些，有人居住的岛，以及若干小岛。最大的罗亚坦，长长的，像个梭子；东西30余海里长，南北不过3到4海里。到那儿，我就发现一个奇特的现象：海水平静得像池水，只有朝远处看望，才可以看到有一线白色的细浪。罗亚坦岛上的生态学者罗贝蒂解开了我的谜。原来，巴亚群岛周围生长着极其丰富的珊瑚；尤其是罗亚坦岛以北海底的屏障珊瑚，挡住了海潮。这片珊瑚向大海延伸数里后，突然下滑，形成一道深深的沟壑，因此，在那一线才形成一道细细的浪花；然后又隆起，形成又一片珊瑚屏障，一直延伸到18海里外的深海里。据说，这片珊瑚礁一直向北铺展到伯利兹沿海，其规模仅次于澳大利亚沿海岛屿的珊瑚，居世界第二位。并且集中了加勒比海各种不同类型的珊瑚。珊瑚不仅是海岛的屏障，而且为鱼类的生存、繁衍提供了理想的场所。巴亚群岛附近有上百种鱼，大约有20多种是生活在珊瑚之间的。有的鱼类甚至完全靠着这密集的珊瑚繁殖后代。
      在罗亚坦岛的西海滩，我试着见识了这奇妙的海底生态。从岸边上看，那儿是一片雪白的、细细的沙滩。海水清澈透底，站在齐肩深的水里，还能看见脚趾的颜色和浮起的沙粒。我试着往水里扔了一枚硬币，果然如人们所说，可以看出硬币朝上的是哪一面。在这儿，用不着像专业潜水那样戴面具，背氧气瓶。只要戴上简易的潜水镜，衔一支透气管，往外游二三十米，马上就可以看到奇妙的海底世界：扇状、球形、鹿角般、菊花似的，各式各样的珊瑚里，游动着形形色色的热带鱼；长长的、扁扁的、带彩色花边的，长着黑黄相间杠杠的，布满黑色、红色纹路或是斑斑点点的。我简直惊呆了，真想变成一条鱼，和身边这些小生灵们，一起游向海洋的深处。
            海岛今昔
    晨雾在椰林间弥漫着，渐渐散去。此起彼落的鸡啼，“喳喳”的鸟叫，“咕咕”的蛙声，“吱吱”的蝉鸣，合成一支早晨的奏鸣曲。海水同晚间一样，依然平静得像一泓池水，轻吻着白色的细沙。岸上的紫色牵牛花，从不知哪儿爬出，缠绵在一起，争先恐后向大海铺去，像是期待着大海的吻。椰林直长到海边，裸露着粗壮的根茎，把椰果满不在乎地抛了一地，干枯了也无人理会。直到现在，巴亚群岛还保持着原始的自然风貌。据说，与400多年前哥伦布的船队来到时所看到的景象也差不很多。
    从16世纪初始，英、法、荷兰海盗就盘踞在巴亚群岛，袭击西班牙殖民者从中美洲运珍宝财物去哈瓦那的船队。1782年，西班牙人集中精锐，荡平了岛上各处的海盗据点。后来，英国人又把黑奴运到岛上，西班牙人再次用兵，并把黑奴解往古巴。当时，西班牙人以为岛上已经没人了。其实，有不少海盗携带家属逃进了原始丛林里；也有不少黑奴躲进了山里，他们采摘野果，渔猎为生，结果繁衍不绝。这些岛子成了黑人、混血种人与白人海盗后裔的乐土。至今，岛上居民仍然讲一口据说带有18世纪重音的英语，当然，也会讲西班牙语。岛上的地名，无论新旧，却都是以英语命名的。居民很少，住得也非常分散。椰林深处或是海湾，一座座木头的吊脚屋，有点儿像我国南方一些少数民族的寨子。
    过去，岛民主要从事渔业捕捞，也有少部分务农。现在，不少人改行办起了旅游服务业。去年，泛美开发银行援助洪都拉斯，在最大的罗亚坦岛上修建了飞机跑道与一条干线公路，方便了旅游业的发展。只有2万余当地居民的罗亚坦岛却接待了2万多游客！最热门的旅游活动是潜水观看海底生态，运动钓鱼，登山到原始森林探险。不过，直到目前为止，大多数岛民依然以海洋渔业为生，全岛大大小小共有300条渔船，主要捕捞大虾与龙虾；当局只规定了大虾的禁渔期；由于龙虾是巡游资源，因此，只规定不得捕捞小于4英寸的龙虾。岛上有3座水产速冻加工厂。我参观了其中最大的“蓝水”加工厂。时值旺季，虽然是星期天，车间仍然开工。工人们把从渔民那儿收购来的大虾洗净，通过自动分拣机，按大小不同规格筛选。然后装袋装盒速冻。龙虾则是人工分拣，也按大小规格分装速冻。这家工厂有160个工人，每天处理2万磅虾，冷冻，包装后，直接用冷冻船运到美国佛罗里达去，换回外汇，一半交给政府折成本国货币，另一半企业自留。巴亚群岛由于地理之便，源源不断得到大自然赐予的海洋财富。（附图片）
