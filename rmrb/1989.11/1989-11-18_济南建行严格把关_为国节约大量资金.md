Jinan Construction Bank strictly controls the planning process, reviews engineering budgets, and supervises the conversion of construction projects to operational status. In just the first ten months of this year, it has saved the country over 100 million yuan in construction funds.

Jinan Construction Bank has focused on three key areas: First, they firmly control the planning process. They strictly adhere to the annual investment plans issued by the state, resolutely preventing projects that exceed the plan, scale, or standards. For items that are prohibited from being purchased or are otherwise unreasonable, they refuse to approve the expenditures. Statistics show that since the beginning of this year, they have rejected 740 such expenditures, totaling over 15 million yuan. Second, they improve the review of engineering budgets. They have changed the previous system where the bank simply reviewed the budgets submitted by the construction units to a system where the construction enterprises, construction units, and the bank jointly review the budgets. This has effectively prevented overestimation and fraudulent accounting. This alone has saved the country over 10 million yuan in construction funds in the first ten months of this year. Third, they supervise the conversion of construction projects to operational status. In recent years, some construction units, in order to protect their own interests, have not promptly converted completed projects to operational status, causing state investments to remain on the construction books for extended periods. This has created unreasonable construction projects and resulted in financial losses. They have addressed this issue by reporting the situation to higher authorities, propagating relevant policies to the construction units, and working with the relevant departments to inspect and convert the projects. For example, the railway branch of the bank has, in the past two years, facilitated the conversion of over 100,000 yuan in construction projects to operational status, annually increasing fixed asset depreciation and major repair funds by 7668 million yuan.

    济南建行严格把关  为国节约大量资金
    本报讯　济南市建设银行通过严把计划口子、审查工程预决算、督促基建工程投产转资等项工作，仅今年头十个月就为国家节约了1亿多元的建设资金。
    济南市建设银行主要抓住了三个环节：一是牢牢把住计划口子。他们严格按照国家下达的投资计划落实年度投资，坚决杜绝超计划、超规模、超标准工程，对基建中的禁购物资和其他不合理的开支，坚决不开“绿灯”。据统计，今年以来共拒付此类开支740笔，金额达1500多万元。二是搞好工程预决算。变过去你报我审为施工企业、建设单位、建设银行“三堂会审”，有效地杜绝了“高估冒算”现象。仅此一项，今年头十个月就为国家节约建设资金1000多万元。三是督促建设单位投产转资。近几年，有些建设单位为了维护本单位利益，对建成的项目不予及时转资，使国家投资长期停留在基建帐面上，形成不合理的在建工程，人为地造成了财政流失。他们针对这一情况，通过向上级有关部门反映情况、向建设单位宣传有关方针政策，会同主管部门验收转资等办法，使这一问题得到了较好的解决。以该行铁路支行为例，近两年来就促成建设单位交付使用转资10万余元，每年可提固定资产折旧和大修基金7668万元。
