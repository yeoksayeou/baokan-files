The fifth day of the fifth World Cup women's volleyball tournament saw four matches between teams of similar strength. The results were China, Cuba, East Germany, and Japan defeating Peru, the Soviet Union, Canada, and South Korea respectively, all by a score of 3-0.

The Chinese team took the court today with the same starting lineup as yesterday, playing with more strategy and a combination of powerful spikes and delicate tips. They employed various offensive tactics and maintained an aggressive and proactive approach throughout the match. Their blocking was particularly outstanding, accounting for about one-third of their points. Additionally, their serves directly resulted in 6 points. The Chinese team secured victory in just one hour with scores of 15-9, 15-5, and 15-8. However, the Chinese team also exposed weaknesses in their reception, leading to several lost points.

The match between Cuba and the Soviet Union was the highlight of the tournament. The Cuban team demonstrated exceptional attacking skills and excelled in blocking, serving, and tactical execution, consistently dominating the Soviet team. They clearly outclassed their opponents, winning 3-0 (15-4, 15-6, 15-12) against the defending Olympic champions from the Soviet Union.

The other two matches were between East Germany and Canada, and Japan and South Korea, both featuring teams of similar height and playing style. East Germany won all three sets against Canada with scores of 15-12, 15-10, and 15-12. Japan, playing with increasing vigor, defeated South Korea 3-0 (15-6, 15-7, 15-2), avenging their recent loss in the Asian Championships. Tomorrow, the eight teams will move to Osaka. The highly anticipated match between China and Cuba is scheduled for the day after tomorrow.

    中国女排3∶0闯过秘鲁一关
    古巴姑娘气势旺盛直落三局胜苏联队
    本报东京11月8日电　记者于青报道：进入第二天的第五届世界杯女排赛的四场比赛，是在实力相近的队伍之间展开的。结果中国、古巴、民主德国和日本队分别以3∶0战胜秘鲁、苏联、加拿大和南朝鲜队。
    中国队今天首先出场的是与昨天相同的主力阵容，比昨天打得更有章法，重扣与轻吊结合，使用多种进攻战术，始终打得积极主动，拦网表现尤为突出，约1／3的得分是拦网所得。另外发球直接得6分。中国队仅用一个小时的时间，以15∶9、15∶5和15∶8直落三局取胜。但中国队也暴露了接发球方面的不足，为此多次失分。
    古巴队与苏联队的较量是本届比赛的重头戏。古巴队不仅表现了高超的强攻能力，在拦网、发球和战术运用方面也很出色，始终压着苏联队打，明显技高一筹，以3∶0（15∶4、15∶6、15∶12）战胜去年奥运会冠军苏联队。
    其他两场比赛是在身高接近、打法相似的民主德国队与加拿大队、日本队与南朝鲜队之间进行的。民主德国队在3个25分钟内，以15∶12、15∶10、15∶12连胜加拿大队三局。日本队今天越战越勇，以3∶0（15∶6、15∶7、15∶2）打败南朝鲜队，报了不久前在亚洲锦标赛中失利的一箭之仇。明天8支女队移师大阪。后天中国队与古巴队的比赛引人注目。
