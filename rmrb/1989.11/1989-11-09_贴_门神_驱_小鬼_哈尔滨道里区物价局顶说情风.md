Title: Posting "Door Gods" to Dispel "Little Devils"

At the entrance of the Dalin District Price Bureau in Harbin, there are two notices. One is a list of taxi drivers who have violated pricing regulations:

"Yang Binjie, did not use the meter, fined 400 yuan;
Liang Junmin, did not use the meter, fined 400 yuan;
Zhang Guangzhi, no price tag, fined 200 yuan..." The other is a notice to those who try to intercede from inside or outside the bureau: "Those who intercede from within the bureau will be required to make a public apology within the bureau and will have their monthly bonus deducted. Those who intercede from outside will have an additional 20% fine imposed on the unit or individual being interceded for."

The deputy director of the bureau, Zhang Gui, told the reporter: "These are two 'door gods,' very effective. This time, when we checked the taxis, there was not a single person who tried to intercede. The 5390 yuan in fines have all been collected."

Handling taxi violations has always been a headache for the price bureau. Taxi drivers are resourceful, and once they are caught violating pricing regulations, they call on friends and acquaintances to intercede, making it difficult for the price bureau to handle. This year, the Dalin District Price Bureau has conducted six inspections of taxis, but each time it ended up being a case of "big start, small finish," with no resolution. Someone helplessly referred to these interceders as "little devils hard to stop."

On the eve of National Day, the Dalin District Price Bureau, during its seventh inspection of taxis, learned from past experiences and decided to publicly post the names of the drivers, the details of their violations, and the fines on the wall. They also attached a notice to those who try to intercede from inside or outside the bureau: "Maintain self-respect and refrain from speaking." The bureau also stipulated that inspection personnel from each section are only responsible for inspection and registration, and for proposing handling opinions, while the fines are collected by the office. This move made those who try to intercede from inside or outside the bureau hesitate. A public security official, an old friend of the bureau's director and deputy director, came to intercede for his son who had violated pricing regulations. Seeing the two "door gods," he said nothing and turned around to leave. He went home and persuaded his son to pay the 200 yuan fine in full the next day.

### 贴“门神”驱“小鬼”——哈尔滨道里区物价局顶说情风

    贴“门神”驱“小鬼”
    ——哈尔滨道里区物价局顶说情风
    新华社记者　刘广军
    在哈尔滨市道里区物价局门口，有两张告示，一张是写着车主姓名的出租车违价处理表：
    “杨滨杰，未开计价器，罚款400元；
    梁俊民，未开计价器，罚款400元；
    张广志，无价格标签，罚款200元……”另一张是告内外说情者“自尊自重、免开尊口”书：“本局内部说情者除在全局作公开检查外，扣发当月奖金。外部说情者，对被说情单位或个人加罚20％。”
    这个物价局的副局长张贵告诉记者：这是两张“门神”，很灵。这次查处出租车没有一个说情的，日前5390元罚款已全部收齐。
    查处出租车一直是物价部门头痛的事。出租车车主神通广大，一旦查出违价，就呼朋唤友上门说情，使物价部门难以招架。今年道里区物价局前后6次查处出租车，最后都是虎头蛇尾，不了了之。有人无可奈何地称这些说情者是“小鬼难挡”。国庆节前夕，道里区物价局在第7次查处出租车时，吸取教训，决定把查处的车主姓名、违价情况、罚款金额张榜上墙，并附以告内外说情者“自尊自重、免开尊口”书，实行公开办案，群众监督。局里还规定各科检查人员只负责检查登记，提出处理意见，罚款由办公室统一收缴。此招一出，内外说情者望而却步。一位公安部门的干部，是局里正、副两位局长的老朋友，上门给违价的儿子说情，看到两张“门神”后，二话没说，转身就走，回家动员儿子第二天全数缴纳了200元罚款。
