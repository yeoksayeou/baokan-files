For some time now, employing the "two-pronged strategy" has almost become an open secret among certain enterprises. One approach is to produce samples with no expense spared, meticulously crafted to possess the competitive edge required for any level of quality evaluation; the other is to relax quality control over regular production, lower standards, and produce shoddy goods. This method of "building a brand" exploits consumers' preference for "famous" and "high-quality" products to conceal backwardness, peddle substandard goods, and steer enterprise operations off course.

There is no doubt that the "two-pronged strategy" brings only partial and short-term benefits to enterprises. Because quality issues will inevitably be exposed during the product consumption process. Isn't the frequent occurrence of crises in the reputation of "famous" and "high-quality" brands enough to make these enterprises wake up?

For a long time, whether it is government supervisory departments or industry associations conducting evaluations, the practice has largely been to draw samples from enterprises. Although there is also supervisory sampling, it is often just for show. This provides an opportunity for the "two-pronged strategy" to be fully implemented, allowing enterprises to send a small number of high-quality products to the evaluation committee, while leaving a large number of substandard products for consumers. From this, it can be seen that to eliminate the "two-pronged strategy" trick, it is necessary to improve the sampling system for evaluations. Direct sampling from the market for evaluation is the only feasible measure. This will promote healthy competition among enterprises, improve product quality, and protect consumers' interests.

　　“两路拳脚”  可以休矣
　　李则胜
    一段时间以来，耍弄“两路拳脚”几乎成了一些企业公开的秘密。一路是做样品，不惜工本，精心操作，使之具备任何一级评优会上进行角逐的实力；另一路是放松对正常生产的质量管理，降低标准，粗制滥造。这种“创牌子”的手段，利用消费者崇尚“名”“优”产品的心理遮掩落后，推销伪劣，把企业经营引向歧途。
    毫无疑问，“两路拳脚”带给企业的只是局部和眼前的利益，因为在产品消费过程中，质量问题迟早会暴露出来。时有所闻的“名牌”、“优质”的信誉危机难道不足以使这些企业警醒么？
    长期以来，不论是政府主管部门还是行业、协会的评比，都基本沿袭了在企业抽取样品的惯例，虽然也搞监督抽样，但常常是表面文章。这就为“两路拳脚”的充分施展提供了机会，使企业可以把少量精品堂而皇之地送到一言九鼎的评委案前，而把大批偷工减料之产品留给消费者。由此可见，要废止“两路拳脚”的把戏，完善评比取样制度，从市场直接抽样参评才是唯一可行的措施。这样才能促使企业之间进行健康的竞争，提高产品质量，保护消费者的利益。
