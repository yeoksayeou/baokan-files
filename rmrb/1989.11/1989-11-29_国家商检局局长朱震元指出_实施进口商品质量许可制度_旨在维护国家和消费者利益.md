	The Director of the State Bureau of Commodity Inspection, Zhu Zhenyuan, said today that China's implementation of the quality permit system for important imported commodities is aimed at strengthening the inspection and quality supervision of imported commodities, protecting the lives and property of the Chinese people, safeguarding national and consumer interests, and promoting the smooth development of foreign trade.

	It is reported that after the State Bureau of Commodity Inspection announced the implementation of the quality permit system for important imported commodities on August 1 this year, it attracted attention both domestically and internationally. Most foreign businesses and foreign organizations understand China's implementation of this system. So far, more than 70 companies and agents from over 10 countries and regions, including Japan, Sweden, and the United States, have requested materials from China and have formally submitted written applications. The State Bureau of Commodity Inspection has issued 73 formal task letters based on the applications. However, some foreign businesses still have doubts.

	Zhu Zhenyuan pointed out that China is implementing this system in accordance with the relevant provisions of the "Law of the People's Republic of China on the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities." Implementing a quality permit system for imported commodities is a common practice internationally to protect national and consumer interests. The first batch of imported commodities subject to the quality permit system in China includes automobiles, motorcycles, motorcycle engines, refrigerators, refrigerator compressors, air conditioners, air conditioner compressors, televisions, and picture tubes. In recent years, there have been many quality problems with these 9 imported commodities in China, especially those related to safety issues.

	The quality permit system for these 9 imported commodities will be implemented starting May 1, 1990. Zhu Zhenyuan said that China's commodity inspection departments have made preparations, established a complete evaluation and review system, formulated implementation rules and safety testing items and standards for the 9 commodities, and set up 6 review departments and 9 commodity inspection laboratories. They have also trained a group of specialized personnel. Foreign factories need to study China's relevant laws and standards, modify the design of the commodities in accordance with the standards, and provide samples, etc. It is hoped that foreign businesses will submit their applications as early as possible.

　　国家商检局局长朱震元指出
　　实施进口商品质量许可制度
　　旨在维护国家和消费者利益
    本报北京11月28日讯　记者王锦鹄报道：国家商检局局长朱震元今天在此间说，我国对重要进口商品实施质量许可制度，目的是为了加强对进口商品的检验和质量监督，保护我国人民的生命和财产安全，维护国家和消费者利益，促进对外贸易的顺利发展。
    据悉，国家商检局于今年8月1日公布对重要进口商品实施质量许可制度后，引起国内外关注。大多数外商和外国机构对我国实施这一制度表示理解。到目前为止，已有日本、瑞典、美国等10多个国家和地区的70多个公司及代理商向我方索取资料，并陆续正式提出书面申请。国家商检局根据申请，已正式下达73份任务书。但是，一部分外商仍有疑虑。
    朱震元指出，我国是根据《中华人民共和国进出口商品检验法》的有关规定实施这一制度的。对进口商品实施质量许可制度，是国际上通常采用的保护本国和消费者利益的普遍做法。我国首批执行进口商品质量许可制度的有汽车、摩托车、摩托车发动机、电冰箱、电冰箱压缩机、空调器、空调器压缩机、电视机和显像管9种进口商品。近几年来，我国进口的这9种商品发生质量问题较多，特别是涉及安全项目的问题较突出。
    这9种进口商品从1990年5月1日起开始执行质量许可制度。朱震元说，我国商检部门已经作好准备，建立了一套完备的考核、审查体系，制订了实施细则和9种商品的安全检测项目和标准等，还建立了6个审查部和9个商检实验室，培训了一批专门人才。外国工厂要对我国的有关法规、标准进行研究，对照商品修改设计，提供样品等，希望外商能及早提出申请。
