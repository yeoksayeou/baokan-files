Geng Fangzhu has been teaching at Shaanxi Road Primary School in Nanjing since graduating from a teacher training college at the age of 17, and has been there for 26 years. He loves his students and is dedicated to educational reform, having been awarded the titles of provincial and municipal labor model and provincial special-level teacher. Recently, he was also honored as a national labor model.

At Shaanxi Road Primary School, parents all hope that their children will be in Geng Fangzhu's class. Why? Parents say, "When we hand our children over to Teacher Geng, we feel at ease"; "I've listened to Geng Teacher's classes, and it's truly outstanding"; "Geng Teacher knows better than we parents do how to truly care for children."

Not Giving Conclusions to Students Freely

In his teaching, Geng Fangzhu corrects the traditional emphasis on conclusions over processes, using the reading process as a training process to enhance students' ability to apply what they learn. For example, when teaching the lesson "Amber," when discussing the conditions required for the formation of amber, he did not simply give the answers to the students. Instead, he first let the students speak freely and then discussed with them the meaning of conditions, the order of primary and secondary conditions, and how to train language skills. In this way, the students not only learned knowledge but also learned methods of analysis and summary.

Geng Teacher believes: "If conclusions are freely given, it actually cancels out the students' thinking process."

Geng Fangzhu pays attention to the entire class during his lessons, ensuring that no one is left out. Once, during a class, Geng Fangzhu asked a question, and half the class raised their hands. He thought: The other half of the class did not raise their hands, indicating they were stuck. He asked the students who raised their hands to lower them and instead asked those who did not raise their hands, "What is difficult about this question?" These students eagerly raised their hands and pointed out more than ten difficulties. He then asked the students to answer based on these points. However, when the bell rang, the class ended. Although this class did not form a unified standard answer, Geng Fangzhu's goal of using the reading process as a training process was successfully achieved. Geng Fangzhu has conducted hundreds of observation and research classes, and all experts and colleagues who have attended his classes praise him: "Listening to Geng Teacher's classes is both an inspiration for language teaching reform and an artistic experience."

The Little Monkey Stamp on the Composition Book

In guiding primary school students' compositions, Geng Fangzhu has unique insights. He is puzzled by some teachers who are reluctant to give 90 points: "They often compare students' compositions to outstanding pieces in magazines, which is not reasonable. This easily discourages students' enthusiasm for writing. A reasonable scoring method is to distinguish the requirements for each grade in composition, and as long as the requirements are met, high scores should be given." Geng Fangzhu pays attention to inspiring students' interest in writing from everyday trivial matters, making composition a way for students to express their feelings and thus a pleasant activity. Another key point is to evaluate compositions in a timely manner. Geng Fangzhu believes that from a psychological perspective, primary school students would like the teacher to evaluate their compositions the day after they are submitted. If the evaluation is delayed until the next week's composition class, the students may have already forgotten.

Therefore, he always makes time to review and evaluate compositions, starting from the next day, using morning meetings, individual conversations, and other opportunities to evaluate in parts, achieving good results. In the students' composition books, as long as there is a bit of originality, even if a fresh and appropriate word is used, he will mark it to encourage them. Geng Fangzhu's current class consists of students mostly born in 1980, the Year of the Monkey, so he carved a monkey zodiac stamp, lively and lovely. Whenever a composition is well-written, a monkey stamp is placed on the book. Thus, students eagerly flip through their composition books to see if there is a cute little monkey stamp.

School Education Cannot Produce "Substandard Products"

Since 1980, Geng Fangzhu has conducted three rounds of teaching experiments. Over the years, the language scores of the classes he taught have consistently ranked at the top in the district. These students have maintained good learning momentum and potential after entering middle school, receiving praise from parents and middle school teachers. His classroom teaching has also been filmed and broadcast on television for promotion. Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and other provinces have invited him to give lectures or demonstration classes. When he went to Xi'an, he arrived in the afternoon the day before and gave a lecture the next morning. At the request of the local authorities, he decided to add a demonstration class at the last minute. He immediately prepared the topic and lesson plan, and the next day, after meeting the students to understand the situation, he gave a public class the following morning. Afterward, he did not even have time for lunch, rushing straight to the train station to catch the train back to Nanjing and return to school to teach.

As a class teacher, Geng Fangzhu's principle is: Factories allow a certain rate of defective products, but school education must not produce substandard products, otherwise, for teachers, it might be a fraction of a percent, but for families with only one child, it is 100%. Therefore, he has devoted more effort to underachieving students. Last year, before a student graduated, his father was on a business trip, and his mother was sick, so he took the student into his own home, taking care of his studies and life, resulting in the student successfully entering middle school. For some parents who use simple methods to educate their children, he invites parents to school to listen to classes and introduces to them the characteristics and methods of primary school students' physical and mental development, deeply inspiring the parents.

Geng Fangzhu is thus handing over a string of keys to the treasure house to the children.

    交给学生开启宝库的钥匙
    ——记南京山西路小学特级教师耿方珠
    本报记者　龚永泉
    耿方珠自17岁从师范毕业后来到南京市山西路小学，一干就是26年。他热爱学生，潜心教学改革，先后被评为省、市劳动模范、省特级教师，最近又被评为全国劳动模范。
    在山西路小学，学生家长都希望自己的孩子能在耿方珠班上。为什么？家长们说：“把孩子交给耿老师，我们放心”；“我听过耿老师上课，那真是没得说”；“耿老师比咱当父母的更知道怎样才叫疼孩子”。
    不向孩子慷慨赠送结论
    在教学中，耿方珠纠正传统教学中轻过程重结论的现象，把阅读过程作为训练过程，提高学生举一反三的能力。比如，上“琥珀”一课时，讲到形成琥珀需要什么条件时，他没有简单地把答案告诉学生，而是先让学生们大胆发言，然后，再围绕什么叫条件，条件主次顺序、以及如何锻炼语言等问题一一让大家讨论。这样，同学们不仅学到了知识，更学到了分析归纳的方法。
    耿老师认为：“如果慷慨赠送结论，实际上就取消了学生的思维过程”。
    耿方珠上课时着眼于全体同学，注意不留“死角”。一次上课时，耿方珠提问，全班有一半人举手。他想：还有一半同学未举手，证明他们卡壳了。他请举手的同学把手放下来，却向未举手的同学提了一个问题：“这个问题难在哪里？”这些同学高高举起了手，一下子说了十几个难点，他便就此向学生征答。但征答得差不多时，下课铃响了。虽然这堂课没有形成统一的标准答案，但耿方珠把阅读过程作为训练过程的目的是圆满地达到了。耿方珠曾开设过数百节观摩课、研究课，凡听过他课的专家和同行都交口称赞：听耿老师的课，既是一种语文教改的启发，又是一种艺术欣赏。
    作文本上的小猴子印章
    在指导小学生作文上，耿方珠也有独到的见解。他对有的教师一打到90分就心疼表示不解：“他们往往是跟报刊上的优秀作文相比，这怎么行？这很容易挫伤学生作文的积极性。合理的打分办法是，分清各年级在作文方面所达到的要求，只要达到了就该给高分”。耿方珠注意从日常琐事中激发学生写作文的兴趣，使作文成为学生倾吐感受的机会，从而成为一件愉快的事情。再一个环节就是要及时地讲评。耿方珠认为，从小学生的心理来看，恨不得上午交了作文，下午老师就能讲评，如果等下星期作文课时再讲评，学生可能早就忘掉了。
    因此，他总是抓紧时间批阅，从第二天起，利用晨会、个别谈话等时机，化整为零，陆续讲评，效果很好。在学生的作文本上，只要有一点新意，甚至用了一个新鲜贴切的词汇，他也要打个符号，以示激励。耿方珠目前所教的班级，学生大都是1980年出生的，属猴，他便刻了个猴的生肖印，活泼可爱，凡作文做得好的，本子上就可盖一个猴印。于是，学生们一拿到作文本，便迫不及待地翻找有没有那个可爱的小猴子。
    学校教育不能出“次品”
    从1980年起，耿方珠已进行了三轮教学实验。这些年来，他教的毕业班语文成绩都在全区名列前茅，这些学生在升入中学后，仍有良好的学习态势和后劲，受到家长和中学教师的好评。他的课堂教学实况也被拍成电视录相，进行推广。广西、云南、贵州、陕西等省都慕名请他去讲学或上示范课。去西安时，头天下午到，第二天一早就进行了讲学。应当地要求，临时决定增上示范课，他立即着手定主题，拟教案，第二天下午接触学生了解情况，第三天上午上公开课，事后连午饭也未顾上吃，直奔火车站乘车返宁，赶回学校上课。
    作为班主任，耿方珠的宗旨是：工厂的产品允许有不合格率，学校的教育却千万不能出次品，否则，对教师来说，也许是几十分之一，但对独生子女家庭来说，却是100％。因此，他对后进生倾注了更多的心血。去年，一位后进生临毕业前，父亲出差，母亲生病，他就把这个学生接回自己家中，照料他的学习和生活，结果他顺利地升入中学。针对一些家长对孩子教育方法简单化，他邀请家长来校听课，向家长介绍小学生身心发展特点和教育方法，使家长深受启发。
    耿方珠就是这样把一串串宝库的钥匙交到了孩子们手上。
