In the first half of this year, one of the most impoverished regions in China, Zhaotong in Yunnan Province, transported 912 carloads of grain from other provinces. Along the way, 147 carloads were stolen, accounting for 16.1% of the total shipment, with a total weight of over 100,000 kilograms.

We hope that relevant departments will take strong measures to crack down on theft along the railway lines and ensure the safe transportation of grain.

　　粮食遭盗窃  扶贫受影响
    今年上半年，全国特困地区之一的云南省昭通地区，从外省调运粮食九百一十二个车皮，沿途被盗一百四十七个车皮，占总调运的百分之十六点一，数量高达十多万公斤。
    希望有关部门采取强有力措施，狠狠打击铁路沿线的盗窃犯罪活动，确保粮食运输的安全。
