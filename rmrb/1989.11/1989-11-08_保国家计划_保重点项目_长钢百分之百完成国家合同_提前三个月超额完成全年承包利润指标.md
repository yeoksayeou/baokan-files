The workers of the Changcheng Special Steel Company have taken an owner's attitude, actively offering suggestions for the enterprise and sharing the nation's burdens. Despite the challenges of energy shortages, limited raw materials, and insufficient funds, all employees have shown unprecedented enthusiasm for completing national plans and ensuring key national projects. By the end of September, the company had achieved a profit of 1.0231 billion yuan and a combined profit and tax revenue of 2.0386 billion yuan, representing increases of 70% and 51% respectively compared to the same period last year. These figures set new historical records and exceeded the annual profit target three months ahead of schedule. Despite delays in the supply of planned raw materials, the company still managed to complete 100% of its national contracts.

This company is a major production base for high-temperature alloys and special steels in China, with products widely used in major national defense high-tech projects such as satellites and rockets, as well as in the manufacturing and production of various civilian products like automobiles and aircraft. This year, market sluggishness has severely impacted normal production. Faced with this situation, the employees of Longgang Steel are determined to protect national key projects and complete national contracts. They have taken reform as the guiding principle, exploring various beneficial measures to enhance the enterprise's vitality and activate its operations.

They have established an enterprise motivation mechanism, formulating a clear and inspiring set of performance targets alongside a practical and economically linked set of benefit targets. This approach integrates the enterprise's responsibilities to the state, its own development, and the interests of the workers, forming a community of shared destiny between the enterprise and its employees.

They have also improved and deepened the contract responsibility system, breaking down the company's contracted indicators into each department, workshop, section, and position, and signing contracts at each level. The contract forms are flexible and varied, including full-staff contracts, lease contracts, and specialized contracts. The principle of the contract is to ensure that each level supports the next, the entire workforce supports the company, and the company supports national plans and key national projects.

The company has also implemented scientific management, using linear programming to optimize product structures, value engineering to reduce procurement costs, and network technology to shorten maintenance periods, all of which have yielded significant results.
