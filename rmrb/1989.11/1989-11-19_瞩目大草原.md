The area of grasslands in our country is three times that of arable land, but the output value of grassland livestock farming accounts for only 1.3% of the total agricultural output value. Vice Minister of Agriculture Liu Jiang, based on his recent investigations and studies, proposed: To enhance the momentum of our country's agricultural production, we should not only continue to make the most of the 1.5 billion mu of arable land, but also—

Focus on the Great Grasslands

	•	Reporter Chen Jian •

The economy of the pastoral areas is currently in the second peak of development since liberation. The prominent contradiction in the current livestock industry is the coexistence of severe grassland degradation and underdevelopment.

Reporter: Recently, I went to the pastoral areas for an interview and heard some contradictory statements. On one hand, it is generally believed that grassland degradation is severe; a group of experts from the Lanzhou Grassland Ecological Research Institute even proposed that it is now difficult to find an undamaged grassland. On the other hand, it is almost unanimously believed that the grassland has great development potential, and improving the status of grassland livestock farming in agriculture is very promising. How should we view this contradiction?

Liu Jiang: After visiting some pastoral areas, I also have the same feeling: the severe degradation and desertification of grasslands and the underdevelopment of grasslands coexist, which is a realistic contradiction in our country's grasslands. This involves the overall understanding of the development of our country's livestock industry.

Our country's livestock industry has, since 1985, entered the second peak of development since liberation. From what I have seen recently in Inner Mongolia and Gansu, the number of livestock increased by 88.8% and 114.5% respectively from 1985 to 1988. Even in Qinghai, where the per capita income of herdsmen is the lowest, it has reached 600 yuan. Compared with the first peak of development from 1960 to 1965, this peak has the following characteristics: first, the promulgation of the "Grassland Law" and the convening of the "Pastoral Area Work Conference" have clarified the major policies for grassland development; second, the implementation of the dual contract responsibility system for grass and livestock has laid the foundation for the activation of the micro-level in the pastoral areas; third, the state has reasonably adjusted the prices of livestock products, increasing the income from livestock; fourth, the state has begun the basic construction of grassland livestock and the comprehensive development trial of pastoral modernization, guiding herdsmen to raise livestock scientifically. It is under such a background that the grassland livestock industry has shown a thriving development situation.

However, the situation is not optimistic. Whether in terms of technology or management level, our country's grassland livestock industry is still very low. At present, the total number of livestock in the country has not increased much compared to 1966, and the number of livestock deaths in the pastoral areas is almost equal to the number of commercial livestock, which means that a considerable number of livestock are being raised in vain. Although the pastoral areas are vast, the amount of meat they provide each year is only equivalent to 1/5 of Sichuan Province and 1/20 of the country. It can be said that the pastoral areas have not yet fully exploited their potential.

However, our country's grasslands indeed have the problem of overgrazing. At present, the carrying capacity of grasslands is more than double that of the 1950s, but the grass yield has generally decreased by 30-50%. Grasslands severely affected by desertification, degradation, and rodent damage account for more than 1/3. Due to long-term neglect of grassland construction and plundering operations, the carrying capacity of our country's grasslands is only 5 sheep units per 100 mu, while it is 33 in the United States and 77 in New Zealand.

It can be said that if the traditional plundering operation method is maintained, the overgrazing of our country's grasslands will become more serious, and the prospects are worrying; but compared with the advanced countries that rely on construction and technological progress for livestock operations, our country is obviously underdeveloped. The key is to transform traditional natural grazing into intensive livestock farming.

To transform from relying on heaven to raise livestock to more reliance on human efforts, we must take the path of technological progress. From the perspective of natural conditions, 1/3 of our country's grasslands can reach the production level of American grasslands, and most grasslands can reach the production level of Australian grasslands.

Reporter: Indeed, everyone feels that we must take the path of building livestock farming, but how can we quickly enter a virtuous cycle?

Liu Jiang: Generally, it still depends on technological progress. The national pastoral area work conference in 1987 had determined that the pastoral areas should vigorously promote ten practical technologies, namely, grassland protection and improvement technologies (such as fencing, aerial seeding, scientific rodent and pest control, etc.), high-quality forage and breeding technologies, artificial grassland technologies, silage, ammoniation, and alkali treatment of feed, artificial insemination and other breeding improvement technologies, annual lamb fattening and cattle and sheep fattening technologies, prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and internal and external parasites in livestock, small and efficient energy-saving shearing, dairy processing, and grass cutting and storage machinery operation technologies, wool cleaning and testing technologies, wind and solar energy application technologies, and new-type shed construction technologies, etc. The promotion and application of these technologies will definitely bring our grassland production to a new level. For example, in 1987, the promotion of Merino sheep alone increased wool production by 132,000 kilograms, with a value of 362 million yuan.

At present, the area of artificial grass planting and improved grassland in the country accounts for only about 2% of the usable grassland area. If efforts are made to increase this proportion to about 50%, the grass yield of our country's grasslands can be doubled. In addition, the conversion rate of our country's forage is only between 1% and 2%, while advanced countries have reached 16%. Increasing this conversion rate, even without increasing the grass yield, can significantly increase the meat yield. Moreover, the current national sheep population is 200 million, with a culling rate of 38%. If this proportion is increased to the achievable 50%, it can not only save a large amount of forage but also increase income by about 2.6 billion yuan.

The area of our country's grasslands is three times that of arable land. For a long time, we have paid great attention to the 1.5 billion mu of arable land, which is indeed something that must be grasped and done well, but we have been too indifferent to the grasslands. At present, the output value per mu of grassland in the country is only about 1 yuan. Some experts have calculated that if technological progress is grasped and comprehensive processing is done well, it is possible to achieve 10 yuan or even 50 yuan per mu. In this way, the output value of pastoral livestock will not be the current 5-6 billion yuan, but 60-300 billion yuan. It can be said that the grasslands are an important source of momentum for our country's agriculture. In some foreign countries with developed grass industries, the output value of grassland livestock in the total agricultural output value accounts for about 25%, while our country currently accounts for only 1.3%. From this, it can be seen that developing our country's grassland livestock industry is very promising. Grassland experts believe that as long as technological progress is grasped, 1/3 of our country's grasslands can catch up with the production level of the United States, and most regions can catch up with the production level of Australia.

The main force for developing grassland production is still the pastoral people, and the state should work on the macro environment. The next few decades will be a period of great development for grass-eating livestock.

Reporter: It seems that you are considering the pastoral areas in the context of the country's agriculture and national economy, treating the grasslands as a new approach to revitalizing and enhancing agricultural momentum. What are your specific considerations for work arrangements?

Liu Jiang: The general idea is that the development of the pastoral economy is still in the hands of the herdsmen. As the administrative department of national agricultural macro-management, the Ministry of Agriculture should, as much as possible, lay a good foundation and provide services for the technological progress of the pastoral economy, especially livestock. This mainly includes: infrastructure construction and service system construction with overall significance, such as the construction of original seed bases for forage, breeding stock bases, technical systems for grassland improvement and livestock improvement, veterinary epidemic prevention systems, rodent and pest control, fire prevention, disaster prevention bases, construction of desertified and degraded grasslands for national land treatment, and the construction of machinery, chemical, and raw material production for the service of livestock development, etc. Due to the implementation of the dual contract responsibility system for grass and livestock and the gradual liberalization of livestock product prices, the micro-level activation of the pastoral areas has already laid a good foundation. As long as this is stabilized, and the state provides support in macro conditions, the development prospects of the pastoral areas will definitely be very good.

Finally, I am optimistic about the prospects of the grasslands for another reason: the per capita daily intake of animal protein in our country is about 7-8 grams, which is only about 1/3 of the world average. It is already very difficult for our country to achieve a per capita grain ration of 400 kilograms, and it will be even more difficult to increase it.

So where is the way to increase meat consumption? It mainly depends on accelerating technological progress, optimizing the structure of livestock and poultry, and developing grain-saving and grass-eating livestock. In other words, the vigorous development of grass-eating livestock is not only a requirement of the pastoral areas but also a requirement determined by China's national conditions. In the next few decades, it should be and is likely to be a period of great development for grass-eating livestock in our country. Let us all strive for this.

    我国草原面积为耕地面积的3倍，但草原牧业产值仅占农业总产值的1.3％。农业部副部长刘江在近年调查研究的基础上提出：增强我国农业生产的后劲，不仅应进一步做好15亿亩耕地的文章，也应该——
    瞩目大草原
    ●　本报记者　陈健　●
    牧区经济正处于解放以来的第二个发展高峰。当前牧业的突出矛盾是草原退化严重和开发不足并存
    记者：最近我到牧区采访，听到一些很矛盾的说法。一方面，普遍认为草原退化严重，兰州草原生态所的一批专家甚至提出：现在已很难找到一块未被破坏的草原；另一方面，几乎又都认为草原开发潜力很大，提高草原牧业在农业中的地位大有可为。对这个矛盾到底应怎么看呢？
    刘江：跑了一些牧区后，我也有同感：草原退化沙化严重和草原开发不足的问题同时存在，是我国草原一个现实的矛盾。这涉及到对我国草原牧业发展的总体认识。
    我国草原牧业，从1985年起，进入了解放以来的第二次发展高峰。从我最近去的内蒙古、甘肃看，1985年到1988年，牲畜头数分别增长了88.8％和114.5％。连牧民人均收入最低的青海，都达到了600元。与1960—1965年的第一次发展高峰相比，这次发展高峰有这么几个特点：一是“草原法”的颁布和“牧区工作会议”的召开，明确了草原发展的大政方针；二是草畜双承包体制的落实，为牧区微观搞活奠定了基础；三是国家对畜产品价格进行了合理调整，提高了牧业收入；四是国家开始了草地牧业的基础建设和牧区现代化综合发展试点，引导牧民科学养畜。正是在这样的背景下，草原牧业出现了欣欣向荣的发展景象。
    但形势又不容乐观。我国草地牧业，不论技术还是经营管理水平，都还很低。目前全国的牲畜总头数并没有比1966年增长多少，而牧区牲畜死亡数几乎与商品数相等，也就是说有相当数量的牲畜是白养了。牧区虽然地域辽阔，但现在每年提供的肉量仅相当于四川省的1／5，全国的1／20。可以说，草原牧区还远未发挥出自己应有的潜力。
      但是，我国草原又的确存在超载过牧问题。目前，草场载畜量比50年代增长了1倍多，而草场产草量却普遍下降了30—50％。沙化、退化、鼠害严重的草场占1／3以上。由于长期忽视草场建设，搞掠夺式经营，我国百亩草场载畜量仅为5个羊单位，而美国是33个，新西兰为77个。
      可以这样说，如果维持传统的掠夺式经营的方式，我国草原超载过牧会更加严重，前景堪忧；但与靠建设靠科技进步经营的先进国家牧业相比，我国又明显开发不足。关键是要把传统自然放牧转变为集约的建设畜牧。
    要把靠天养畜转为更多的靠人养畜，就必须走科技进步的路。从自然条件上讲，我国有1／3的草原可达到美国草原的生产水平，大多数草原可达到澳大利亚的生产水平
    记者：确实，各地都感到必须走建设养畜的路子，但怎样才能尽快走上良性循环的路呢？
    刘江：总的还是依靠科技进步。1987年的全国牧区工作会议，曾经确定了牧区应大力抓好十大实用技术，即保护、改良草场（如围栏、飞播种草、科学灭鼠灭虫等）技术，牧草良种良繁及人工草场技术，青贮、氨化、碱化饲料等饲料加工技术，人工授精等育种改良技术，当年羔羊育肥和牛羊易地育肥技术，家畜传染病和内外寄生虫防治技术，小型高效节能的剪毛、乳品加工、打草储草等机械作业技术，羊毛除污、检测等技术，风力、太阳能等新能源应用技术，新型棚圈建设技术等。这些技术的普及推广，必将使我国草原生产力上一个台阶。举例讲，1987年，全国仅推广美利奴羊一项就净增羊毛132万公斤，产值3.62亿元。
    现在，全国人工种草和改良草地的面积仅占可利用草原面积的2％左右，若经过努力，把这个比例提高到50％左右，我国草原的产草量就能提高1倍。另外，我国的牧草转化率仅在1％—2％之间，而先进国家已达16％，提高这个转化率，即便不增加产草量，也可大幅度提高产肉量。还有，现在全国有2亿只羊，出栏率为38％，若将这个比例提高到完全能够做到的50％，既可大量节约饲草，又可净增26亿元左右的收入。
    我国草原面积是耕地面积的3倍。长期以来，我们很看重15亿亩耕地，当然，这是必须抓紧抓好的，但对草原却过分冷淡了。现在全国每亩草地的产值仅为1元左右，有些专家算过账，若抓好科技进步，搞好综合加工，每亩地搞到10元乃至50元都是可能的。这样，牧区牧业的产值就不是现在的50亿—60亿元，而是600亿元—3000亿元。可以说，草原是我国农业后劲的一个重要源泉。国外一些草业发达的国家，农业总产值中草地牧业的产值占到25％左右，而我国目前仅占1.3％。由此可见，发展我国草地牧业是大有可为的。草原专家们的看法是：只要抓好科技进步，我国1／3的草地生产水平可赶上美国，大多数地区的草原生产力水平可赶上澳大利亚。
    发展草原生产力的主力军还是牧区群众，国家要在宏观环境上下功夫。今后几十年将是草食牲畜大发展时期
    记者：看来，您是把牧区放在国家农业和国民经济的大盘子里考虑的。把草原作为搞活和增强农业后劲的一个新招。在具体工作安排上有什么考虑呢？
    刘江：总的想法是，发展牧区经济的主人还是牧民。作为国家宏观农业管理的行政部门，农业部要尽可能为牧区经济尤其是畜牧业的科技进步打好基础，提供服务。这主要包括：带有全局性的基础设施建设和服务体系建设，如牧草的原种基地建设，种畜基地建设，草原改良和牲畜改良的技术体系建设，兽医防疫体系建设，治虫灭鼠、防火、防灾基地建设，国土治理性的沙化、退化草原的建设，以及为牧业发展服务的机械、化工、原材料生产建设等。由于草畜双承包经营责任制的落实和畜产品价格的逐渐放开，牧区的微观搞活已有了一个很好的基础，只要这样稳定下去，国家再在宏观条件上给予支持，牧区的发展前景肯定是相当好的。
      最后要说的是，我对草原前景颇为乐观还有这么一个原因：我国的人均每天的动物蛋白摄入水平大概是7克—8克，只相当于世界平均量的1／3左右。我国的人均口粮搞到400公斤已很不容易了，要再多也很难。
      那么增加肉食的出路在哪里呢？主要得靠加快科技进步，优化畜禽结构，发展节粮和草食牲畜。也就是说，大力发展草食牲畜不仅是牧区的要求，也是由中国国情所决定的。今后的几十年，应当也可能是我国草食牲畜的大发展时期。让我们大家都来为之努力。
