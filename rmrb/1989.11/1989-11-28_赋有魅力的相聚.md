A Gathering Full of Charm

Hongze Lake, with its poetic and picturesque scenery, hides many beautiful stories beneath its surface. However, it is still quite poor, at least for now.

The magazine *New Scripts* chose this place to hold its fourth amateur playwriting discussion forum. The accommodation was in Siyang, quite close to Hongze Lake, about 40 kilometers away, but we didn't go boating. I heard there are cars and motorboats now, but we didn't use them. The crabs in October are very plump, but they didn't bring any here.

Several dozen people spent the whole day cooped up in the guesthouse, eating simple meals, discussing scripts, arguing back and forth, rising with the sun and continuing until late into the night.

Ouyang Shanzun, a veteran expert from the late Qing Dynasty, is 75 years old. People jokingly call him "Old One." He is from Hunan and is known for his stubbornness, as well as his seriousness. This time, we truly had the chance to listen to his teachings.

We sent him 10 scripts, big and small.

Is that all? he asked.

These are the ones I picked out for you. If you can't finish them, it's no problem.

No, I have to do my job properly.

So, all 35 scripts were given to him, and he read them all day, even into the night! It was truly heart-wrenching! I didn't want to burden him too much.

No, no one can be treated specially. He said, and so the scripts were distributed as usual.

In the small group discussions, he was the first to arrive, ten minutes early, carrying a teacup, medicine, scripts, a notebook, and two pairs of glasses.

If he disagreed with your opinion, he would immediately express it. He was very willing to argue with you. While you were speaking, he would be eager to interject, "Have you finished? Have you finished?"

He could quote Goethe, Engels, and Dobrolyubov off the top of his head. A 20-year-old college student argued with him until they were both red-faced. After the meeting, he patted the student on the shoulder: "You should get 10 extra points today."

People lined up to seek his advice. We wanted to stop them. It's too tiring! I'll go back to Beijing and sleep, he said.

An amateur playwright gave him two scripts, wanting him to read one.

Keep them both. He said, I promise you, I'll finish them both.

At the banquet, when the drum passed the flower to him, he sang enthusiastically. The flower stopped in his hands, and he sang a Shaanxi folk song, very tenderly. The lyrics were: "A bowl of white rice, a bowl of porridge, as soon as I pick up the bowl, I think of you, thinking of you, tears drop into the bowl." Everyone applauded for him, and he also applauded for himself.

A few amateur playwrights said that when they heard Old Master Shanzun sing, they really wanted to cry, they couldn't explain why, but they felt an urge, a deep affection for the older generation of artists...

Huang Zongjiang, known as "Old Two," was always smiling at the big and small meetings. Wherever he was, there was laughter. I lived next door to him, and at night I always heard him coughing. During the day, I asked him, and he said: "Occasionally."

Li Qin, ranked "Old Three," is an editor with decades of experience. He has the demeanor of a humble elder, always smiling at everyone. In lively gatherings, you almost forget his presence. When discussing scripts, everyone's gaze naturally focuses on him. He speaks slowly and deliberately, and even if time is up, he doesn't care, he has to finish his opinions.

One author delayed his departure to hear Li Qin's opinion, changing his train ticket. Li Qin felt sorry, but he said he still wanted to discuss it thoroughly. This "Old Three" is so serious.

Liu Chuan, content to be "Old Four," enjoys himself. This playwright, who wrote *The Second Spring* and *Fiery Heart*, is humble in front of amateur playwrights, with a sincere smile, like an older brother. Everyone likes to take pictures with him, pulling him here and there, but he still smiles amiably.

A farmer-author from Hanzhong, Liu Jinquan, has the build of a farmer but speaks elegantly. He said this was a charming artistic discussion forum, and the charm of the participants was especially evident in "Old One," "Old Two," "Old Three," and "Old Four"...

Two generations, what a rare gathering!

　　赋有魅力的相聚
　　徐恒进
    洪泽湖，给人以诗情画意，湖底埋藏着很多美的故事。但是还很穷，起码现在还得这么说。
    《新剧本》杂志社选择了这个地方开了第四届业余剧作讨论会。住地在泗阳，离洪泽湖很近，40公里，但是没游湖，听说汽车也有了，汽艇也有了，没去。十月的螃蟹很肥，车都装了，但没往这儿拉。
    几十个人，就那么整天闷在招待所里，粗茶淡饭，讨论剧本，吵来吵去，日出而作，日落而不息。
    欧阳山尊，是清末的老专家，七十有五，人们戏称老大，湖南人，以“犟”著名，也以认真著名，这回真亲聆其教。
    给他送去剧本，大小10个。
    就这些？他问。
    给你挑的，你看不完没关系。
    不行，公事公办。
    于是35个全部给他，他整天看，到深夜！真不忍心！不想给他负担太重。
    不行，谁也不能特殊。他说。于是照样摊派。
    小组讨论，他提前十分钟，第一个坐到会议室里，带着茶杯，带着药，带着剧本，带着笔记本，带着两副眼镜。
    不同意你的意见，马上表态。很愿意和你争论，你说的时候，他就急于插话，你说完了吗？你说完了吗？
    他能随口背出歌德的话，恩格思的话，杜勃罗留勃夫的话。一个20岁的大学生跟他争得面红耳赤。会后，他拍着大学生的肩：今天应该给你加10分。
    找他听意见的人一个挨一个，我们想挡驾。算了，太困！我回北京再去补觉，他说。
    一个业余剧作者给他拿去两个剧本，想请他看一个。
    都留下。他说，我向您保证，都看完。
    联欢会，击鼓传花，他也兴致盎然。花停在他手里，他唱歌，陕北民歌，很委婉。歌词是：“一碗白面一碗米，端起碗就想起你，想你想你真想你，泪水滴在饭碗里。”大家为他鼓掌，他也为自己鼓掌。
    有几个业余作者说，听山尊老先生唱歌的那一刻儿，真想哭，说不清为什么，就是觉得有一种冲动，对老一辈的艺术家的深情……
    黄宗江，号称老二，大会小会，总是笑嘻嘻地，他在哪组，哪儿就笑声不断。我就住他隔壁，夜里总听他咳嗽，白天问他，他说：偶尔为之。
    李钦，排行老三，几十年的老编辑，谦谦长者风，对谁都露着微笑，不爱说话，热闹场合，你几乎忘记他的存在，议论剧本，大伙就自然而然地目光集中到他身上，他慢条斯理，有板有眼，时间到了也不管，要把意见谈完。
    有一个作者因为等他的意见，推迟上车，换了车票，李钦很抱歉，但他说我还想好好再跟他谈。这个老三就是这么认真。
    刘川，甘居老四，自得其乐，这个写过《第二个春天》、《烈火红心》的剧作家，在业余作者面前，谦逊得像个业余作者，一脸诚挚的笑，像个老大哥，都爱跟他照相，拉过来，拽过去，他还是那么笑得随和。
    汉中农民作者刘金泉，一副庄稼人的体魄，话却斯文。他说这是一次有魅力的艺术讨论会，与会者的魅力，特别表现在老大，老二，老三，老四身上……
    两代人，难得的相聚呵！
