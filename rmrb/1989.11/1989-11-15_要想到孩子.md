    Think of the Children
    As the annual magazine subscription period approaches, some parents want to subscribe to magazines for their children. However, the current selection of children's publications makes it difficult to determine from the subscription titles which age group they are suitable for. This often leads to parents subscribing to magazines that are not appropriate for their children's age group, either too advanced or too simple, which affects the children's reading and learning. It would be helpful if the relevant departments could provide information on the appropriate age group for each magazine during the subscription period, to alleviate the concerns of subscribers.

    要想到孩子
    到了一年一度的报刊订阅时间，一些家长想为孩子订阅报刊。但目前可供订阅的少儿读物，从征订的报刊名称上很难分析判断适合哪个年龄段的孩子阅读，致使一些家长订的报刊不适合自己孩子的年龄段，不是“超前”就是“落后”，影响了孩子阅读学习。报刊适合哪个层次的小读者阅读，希望有关部门在征订报刊时能采取办法说明一下，为订户解忧。
