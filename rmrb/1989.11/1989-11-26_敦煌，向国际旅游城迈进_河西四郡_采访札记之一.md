The Hexi Corridor in Gansu stretches over 1,200 kilometers. This region is a vital passage of the Silk Road. Among its cities, Wuwei, Zhangye, Jiuquan, and Dunhuang have been known as the "Four Prefectures of the Hexi" since the Western Han Dynasty. Over the course of more than 2,000 years, these cities have experienced periods of prosperity and decline, each reflecting the characteristics of their respective eras. The autumn scenery of the Hexi Corridor is beautiful, and the reporters revisited the four prefectures, capturing the strong and fresh impressions they encountered. This series will be published in four parts, with today's being the first.

A medium-sized jet takes off from Lanzhou and lands at Dunhuang Airport in less than two hours. The phrase "Qin Dynasty moon, Han Dynasty pass" now seems like a moment's journey. Today, the Hexi Corridor's transportation network includes highways, railways, and aviation, all of which are in full operation.

Currently, Dunhuang receives over 300,000 domestic and international tourists annually, with this number increasing by 30% each year for the past two years.

A statue in the central square of the city, perhaps a vivid portrayal of Dunhuang today, is modeled after a mural from the Mogao Caves depicting a girl playing the pipa. She dances gracefully, her delicate fingers plucking the strings, welcoming visitors from all directions. The poet says, the girl playing the pipa has emerged from the thousand-year-old cave, and Dunhuang is now open to the world.

Under this statue, the reporter asked two elderly women from Dunhuang, "How is your family doing?" One of the women, wearing gold earrings, smiled and said, "People from all over the world come to Dunhuang; how could Dunhuang residents not be doing well?" The old woman's words reveal the key to Dunhuang's development. The open-door policy, combined with Dunhuang's rich tourism resources, has brought about significant changes to the city year by year. So far, Dunhuang has welcomed visitors from 78 countries and regions, making tourism a pillar industry for the city. Of the city's 20,000 urban residents, one-quarter are employed in the tourism sector. In 1983, tourism revenue accounted for 15.3% of the city's total fiscal income. Tourism has also driven the development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, processing industries, and handicrafts in both urban and rural areas of Dunhuang. In 1949, Dunhuang's fiscal revenue was only 176,000 yuan, but by 1988, it had increased to 1,099 million yuan, which are clear indicators of the city's progress.

Even at midnight, the night market in Dunhuang is still vibrant, with tourists from various countries and regions bustling about. Different languages, but the same laughter, make one wonder if the murals of the Mogao Caves have come to life! The scenes of East-West cultural exchange depicted by the ancient artists are now unfolding before our eyes!

At a snack stall, the reporter saw a blonde foreign woman sitting with a stylish young man from Dunhuang, both enjoying their meal and smiling at each other. This scene is a stark contrast to the past when people would gather to watch foreigners. Even more intriguing is that at the famous scenic spot of the Crescent Moon Spring near the Echoing Sand Dunes, the reporter saw several "camel drivers" from Yangjia Bridge Village who could converse in English with foreign visitors.

In ancient times, a wandering monk carved the first cave into the cliff of the Echoing Sand Dunes. Over the following thousand years, nearly 500 caves were carved into the cliff, leaving behind the world-renowned murals and colored sculptures of the Mogao Caves. However, no dynasty in history has been able to open the "cave" of people's hearts. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the winds of reform and opening up have opened the "cave" of people's hearts. The people of Dunhuang no longer feel that the world is far away; they have come out of their isolation and have never been more eager for prosperity and to engage with the world.

　　敦煌，向国际旅游城迈进
　　——“河西四郡”采访札记之一
　　本报记者　张述圣　新华社记者　曹永安
    甘肃河西走廊，漫漫1200公里。这里是丝绸之路的通衢要道。坐落其间的武威市、张掖市、酒泉市和敦煌市，自西汉时起，便是历史上有名的“河西四郡”。悠悠岁月2000余载，它们繁荣过，凋敝过，它们的每一次兴衰都折射出一个时代。河西秋色好，记者重访四郡，将那强烈和新鲜的感触记了下来。本版分四次刊出，今天是第一篇。
  ——编者
    中型喷气客机从兰州起飞，不足两小时便降落在敦煌机场。“秦时明月汉时关”，如今成了须臾之便。今天河西走廊的交通，公路、铁路、航空，三路并发。
    现在，每年来敦煌的中外游客达30万人，近两年还在以每年30％的幅度递增。
    市中央街心花园的一尊雕塑，或许是今天敦煌形象的生动写照。这是取材于莫高窟壁画的反弹琵琶伎乐姑娘造型，她舞姿婆娑，纤指反拨着琴弦，迎着四方来客。诗人说，反弹琵琶的姑娘走出了千年洞窟，敦煌向全世界开放了。
    就在这尊雕塑下，记者问闲坐在那里的两位敦煌老太太：“家景可好？”一位戴着金耳环的老太太笑道：“漫天下的人都来敦煌，敦煌人的日子能不好吗！”老太太的话道破了敦煌发展的契机，开放政策加上敦煌丰富的旅游资源，敦煌一年一个样地变化着。迄今为止，敦煌已接待了来自78个国家和地区的外国客人，旅游成了敦煌市的无烟产业。敦煌市现有的2万多城镇人口中，有1／4的人从业于旅游。1983年，旅游利税额占全市财政收入的15.3％。旅游业也带动了敦煌城乡农、林、牧、副、渔及加工业、工艺制品的蓬勃发展。1949年敦煌的财政收入仅17.6万元，1988年为1099万元，这两个数字是极好的佐证。
    已是午夜了，敦煌夜市的灯火仍是一片辉煌，各种服饰的中外游客，摩肩接踵。不同的语言，一样的欢笑，令人怀疑莫高窟的壁画复活了！当年画工所描绘的东、西方交流的盛景，不正展现在我们的眼前么！
    在一个小吃摊前，记者看见一位金发碧眼的外国女郎正与一位穿着入时的敦煌小伙同桌品味，他们彼此微笑着。这同几年前“围观洋人”的镜头相比，真是天壤之别。更耐人寻味的是，在著名风景区鸣沙山月牙泉，记者看到杨家桥乡的几位拉骆驼的“骆驼客”，可以用英语同外宾交谈。
    当年一名云游和尚，在鸣沙山崖壁上开凿了第一个洞窟。此后千余年来，历代在崖壁上凿窟近500个，留下了举世闻名的敦煌莫高窟壁画和彩塑。然而历史上的任何一个朝代，却未能凿启人们心灵的这个“洞窟”。十一届三中全会以来，改革开放的春风把人心的“洞窟”催开了。敦煌人再不觉得世界离他们遥远，他们从封闭中走出来，盼望富裕和走向世界的心愿从未像今天这般强烈。
