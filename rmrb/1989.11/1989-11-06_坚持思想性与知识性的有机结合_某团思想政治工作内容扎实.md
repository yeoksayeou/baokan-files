In recent years, a certain regiment of the Shenyang Military Region has readjusted the content of its grassroots ideological and political work, considering both political and ideological content and knowledge and interest. This approach has yielded good results in practice.

	1. Strengthening Content: In recent years, whenever significant changes occur in the situation, or when important policies, laws, and decrees are issued by the Party and the state, the regiment's political department promptly assesses the unit's ideological situation, carefully compiles teaching materials, and conducts thematic education.

	2. Stable Content: Over several years of practice, the regiment's political department, with the goal of cultivating "four-haves" qualified soldiers, has focused on four aspects: loving the military and training, persevering in hard work, observing laws and regulations, and military democracy. They have gradually improved these aspects, changing the previous fragmented approach to ideological and political work, and initially achieving the effect of improving soldiers' quality and solving problems.

	3. Phase-Specific Content: For example, every year when new recruits enlist, targeted thematic education is conducted on topics such as "understanding the responsibilities of a soldier and strengthening military awareness," "remembering the mission of the army and correcting the motivation for enlistment," and "carrying forward fine traditions and living a good military life." This helps new recruits quickly transition from civilians to soldiers. During the demobilization phase for veteran soldiers, thematic education focuses on topics such as "correctly handling issues of staying or leaving," "not removing the military uniform upon returning home," and "striving to be 'four-haves' citizens." This effectively ensures the smooth demobilization of veteran soldiers.

	4. Ad Hoc Content: The regiment's political department addresses various ideological issues that arise among grassroots officers and soldiers during their service, providing timely and correct guidance. For example, they guide soldiers on how to live and work, how to handle various conflicts, how to regulate their behavior, and gradually cultivate the ideological qualities, revolutionary spirit, and habits that soldiers should have, ensuring the completion of various tasks.

	After this year's mission to Beijing to impose martial law to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riot, the ideological and political work of this regiment fully played the role of a "lifeline." The entire regiment was awarded a collective second-class merit citation.

    坚持思想性与知识性的有机结合
    某团思想政治工作内容扎实
    本报讯　近几年来，沈阳军区某团重新调整基层思想政治工作内容，既考虑政治思想性，又兼顾知识趣味性，在实践中收到良好效果。
    强化性内容。这几年，每当形势发生大的变化，党和国家重要政策、法律、法令出台，团政治处都及时摸清部队的思想情况，认真编写教材，搞好专题教育。
    稳定性内容。经过几年实践，这个团政治处着眼于培养“四有”合格军人的总体目标，围绕爱军习武，艰苦奋斗，遵纪守法，军人民主等四方面内容，逐步完善，改变了以往思想政治工作零打碎敲的状况，初步收到提高军人素质和解决问题的实效。
    阶段性内容。如每年新战士入伍，有针对性地进行“认清军人职责，强化军人意识”，“牢记我军宗旨，端正入伍动机”，“发扬优良传统，过好军旅生活”等专题教育，帮助新战士尽快实现由老百姓向军人的转变。老兵退伍阶段，着重围绕“正确对待走留”、“还乡不解甲”、“争做‘四有’公民”等内容进行专题教育，有效地保证了老战士顺利退伍。
    随机性内容。这个团政治处针对基层官兵服役期间随时出现的各种思想问题，及时正确引导。如应该怎样生活、工作，怎样处理各种矛盾，怎样规范自己的言行、逐步培养军人应有的思想品质、革命精神和行为习惯，保证各项任务的完成。
    经过今年赴京戒严制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的考验，这个团的思想政治工作充分发挥了“生命线”的作用，全团荣立集体二等功。
