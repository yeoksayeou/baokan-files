Lacking personnel, funds, and resources, how can more savings outlets be established? The Bank of China's Hohhot branch in Inner Mongolia found a shortcut by collaborating with enterprises.

Inner Mongolia is located on the frontier, covers a vast area, and is an autonomous region for ethnic minorities. In 1987, the entire region had only 6 branches of the Bank of China. Savings outlets were even fewer, with just 1 savings office and 6 dedicated counters. This situation was highly incompatible with the reform and opening-up policy and the development of an outward-looking economy. Under difficult conditions, the Hohhot branch, in addition to establishing Bank of China institutions in all 12 league and city locations across the region, as well as in the border cities of Manzhouli and Erlian, has also been dedicated to developing savings outlets. Near the Qing Song Garment Company, a Sino-Japanese-Hong Kong joint venture in Hohhot, a spacious and bright joint banking and enterprise savings office was quickly established. Now, the Qingcheng District branch of the Hohhot bank has set up 15 joint banking and enterprise savings offices, with 6 more in the process of being established. Since these joint offices began operating in February, they have already attracted over 9 million yuan in savings deposits. People say: joint banking and enterprise operations benefit both parties, convenience the public, and achieve three wins in one go.

    银企联办　一举三得
    缺少人、财、物，能不能增设储蓄网点？中国银行内蒙古呼和浩特分行找到了一条与企业联办的捷径。
    内蒙古地处边陲，幅员辽阔，又是少数民族自治区。1987年，全区中国银行只有6个分支机构。储蓄网点更少，只有1个储蓄所和6个专柜。这与改革开放、发展外向性经济的形势极不相称。呼和浩特分行在困难条件下，除用1年多时间在全区12个盟市所在地和满洲里、二连两个口岸设立中国银行机构外，还致力于发展储蓄网点。在呼市中、日、港合资的青松制衣有限公司旁，一座宽敞明亮的银企联办储蓄所很快建立起来。现在，呼市分行青城区办事处已办起15个银企联办储蓄所，还有6个正在开办。这些联办所今年2月陆续开业以来，已吸收储蓄存款900多万元。人们说：银企联办，各得其利，方便群众，一举三得。（泓赓）
