Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 6th - (Reporter Qǐ Hóngqí) In managing early marriages, bigamy, trafficking of women, illegal cohabitation, and other illegal marriages and cases, Henan Province has adopted a comprehensive approach using education, administration, economics, and law. This has led to a decrease in the illegal marriage rate from 5% in 1985 to 2.06% in 1988, and an increase in the qualified marriage registration rate from 93.2% in 1985 to 96.7% in 1988.

To thoroughly eradicate illegal marriages and standardize and institutionalize marriage management work, in 1987, the Henan Provincial Civil Affairs Department issued the "Henan Province Marriage Registration Procedures Implementation Details," formulated the "Henan Marriage Archives Management Interim Measures," and jointly issued with the Public Security, Courts, and Women's Federation departments the "Opinions on Handling Existing Problems in Marriage Registration Work." Most township governments have also stipulated "three no's" and "eight no registrations" for marriage registration work.

The "three no's" are: officials, especially leading cadres, are not allowed to intercede for their relatives or others; village committees or units are not allowed to issue marriage status certificates for individuals who have not reached the legal marriage age; and no deposits are allowed for any reason.

The "eight no registrations" are: no registration for those under the legal age; no registration for incomplete procedures; no registration for both parties not being present; no registration for marriage status certificates that do not match the household register; no registration for photographs that do not match the individuals; no registration for unstable love foundations; no registration for close relatives, exchanged relatives, blood relatives, or swapped relatives; and no registration for those with diseases that should not be married. In Fangpo Township, Yuzhou City, the marriage registration work strictly enforces all regulations, achieving a 100% legal marriage rate.

    河南综合治理违法婚姻
    婚姻登记合格率逐年上升
    据新华社郑州11月6日电  （记者訾红旗）河南省在治理早婚、重婚、拐卖妇女、非法同居等违法行为和婚姻案件中，教育、行政、经济、法律四管齐下，实行综合治理，使全省违法婚姻率由1985年的5％下降到1988年的2.06％；登记合格率由1985年的93.2％上升到1988年的96.7％。
    为了彻底根除违法婚姻，使婚姻管理工作规范化、制度化，1987年，河南省民政厅发布了《河南省婚姻登记办法实施细则》，制订了《河南婚姻档案管理暂行办法》，并会同公安、法院、妇联等部门联合下发了《关于对婚姻登记工作中存在问题的处理意见》。多数乡镇政府还规定了婚姻登记工作“三不准”、“八不登记”。
    “三不准”是：不准干部、特别是领导干部为自己的亲属或替别人说情；村委会或单位不准给不到法定婚龄的当事人出具婚姻状况证明；不准以任何理由让当事人交纳押金。
    “八不登记”是：不到法定年龄的不登记；手续不全的不登记；双方不到场的不登记；出具的婚姻状况证明与户籍不符不登记；照片与当事人不符不登记；恋爱基础不牢不登记；近亲、转亲、血亲、换亲不登记；患有不应结婚疾病的不登记。禹州市范坡乡在婚姻登记工作中，严格执行各项法规，合法婚姻率达100％。
