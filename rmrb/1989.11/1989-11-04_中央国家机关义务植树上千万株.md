Since 1982, 64 departments and their affiliated units in Beijing have responded to the call by Comrade Deng Xiaoping to launch a nationwide campaign of voluntary tree planting. They have established 88 designated areas and afforestation bases in 12 suburban counties of Beijing, where they have carried out extensive afforestation and greening activities in barren hills and wastelands. After seven years of hard work, they have planted over 10.29 million trees, with a survival rate of over 92%. Calculated on the basis of 190,000 people participating in voluntary tree planting, the average number of trees planted per person is 55.3, exceeding by 72.8% the target of planting 32 trees per person over seven years.

The various departments of the central government agencies have also focused on greening the courtyards of their offices and residential areas, planting a total of 1.14 million tall trees and ornamental trees, 2.69 million shrubs, 590,000 meters of hedges, and 1.33 million square meters of lawns.
