Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 23rd.

Wan Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, met this afternoon with representatives from nine African countries and the United Nations Development Programme and the Ford Foundation attending the China-Africa Economic Reform and Adjustment Seminar at the Great Hall of the People.

Wan Li first extended a warm welcome to the African guests on behalf of the Chinese government and people. He said that China and Africa are both Third World countries with good political and economic cooperation. Currently, both are facing the common problem of how to develop the economy and improve the material and cultural lives of the people. At the same time, China and Africa also share common concerns such as peace, development, population, and the environment.

He said that the development of each country should start from its own history and national conditions, adopting different means.

Wan Li said that developing countries, including China, should prioritize economic construction and, in the process of development, pay special attention to the development of agriculture and education.

He said that the experiences of each country in development can be mutually borrowed, and African countries can also learn from some of the mistakes made in China's economic development over the past forty years. He pointed out that the current rectification and improvement efforts in China are aimed at correcting the overheated economic problems that emerged in previous years.

Wan Li said that over the past decade, China has implemented an open policy, attracting some foreign investment. China's gradually improving investment environment can attract more foreign investment. These investments will play a certain role in China's economic development. However, as a country with 1.1 billion people, China's economic development mainly relies on self-reliance.

He said that in terms of relying on self-reliance for economic development, China is exploring a path that combines planned economy with market regulation. However, from an overall perspective, such a large country cannot do without macro-control.

In discussing the Taiwan issue, he said that Taiwan has recently been conducting so-called "flexible diplomacy" and "economic diplomacy" in Africa and other regions. He said that China's position on this is consistent, and "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" are firmly opposed. He expressed his belief that African countries, which have long had good relations with China, fully understand this.

Salif Ndiaye, the representative of the United Nations Development Programme in Senegal, highly evaluated the seminar on behalf of all the participants.

　　万里会见非洲九国客人时说
　　发展中国家经验可相互借鉴
    新华社北京11月23日电  （记者杨国钧、徐耀中）全国人大常委会委员长万里今天下午在人民大会堂会见了出席中国——非洲经济改革与调整研讨会的九个非洲国家以及联合国开发计划署、福特基金会的代表。
    万里首先代表中国政府和人民向来自非洲的贵宾表示欢迎。他说，中国和非洲都是第三世界国家，有着良好的政治、经济合作关系，目前都面临着如何发展经济、改善人民物质和文化生活的共同问题。同时，中国和非洲还有诸如和平、发展、人口、环境等共同关心的问题。
    他说，各国的发展都应从各自的历史和国情出发，采取不同的手段。
    万里说，包括中国在内的发展中国家都应把经济建设放在首位，并且在其发展过程中，注意把农业的发展和教育放在突出的地位。
    他说，各国在发展中的经验都可相互借鉴，非洲国家也可从中国过去四十年经济发展中的一些失误吸取教训。他指出，中国目前正在进行的治理整顿就是为了纠正前几年出现的经济过热的问题。
    万里说，近十几年来，中国实行开放政策，吸引了一些外资，中国逐步改善的投资环境还可以吸引更多的外资。这些外资将对中国的经济发展起一定作用。但中国作为一个有11亿人口的大国，其经济发展主要还是要靠自力更生。
    他说，在靠自力更生发展经济方面，中国正在探索计划经济与市场调节相结合的途径。但从总体上来说，这样的一个大国没有宏观上的控制是不行的。
    他在谈到台湾问题时说，台湾最近在非洲和其他一些地区开展所谓“弹性外交”、“经济外交”。他说，中国在这方面的立场是一贯的，“两个中国”或“一中一台”都是我们坚决反对的。他表示相信，与中国一直有着良好关系的非洲国家对此是完全理解的。
    联合国开发计划署驻塞内加尔代表萨利夫·恩迪叶代表所有与会者高度评价了这次研讨会。
