In late April, the 4 mu tea garden contracted by farmer Zhang Mingjiang from the 6th production team of Dianzi Village, Dianzi Town, was seized by over 20 villagers from the same team. After the incident, the village suggested that the contractor either increase the proportion of the levy paid to the village or return the investment and management fees and re-contract to someone else. The contractor, Zhang Mingjiang, sued the Dianzi Town People's Court on June 20, citing the village's unilateral breach of contract. After multiple mediations, both parties reached an agreement on September 10 to maintain the original contract.

We found that the main reasons for such disputes are:

1. The contract is too rough. Most of the mountain forest and diversified operation contracts in our county were signed in the autumn of 1984. At that time, due to insufficient work, the contract content was simple, and the rights, responsibilities, and benefits of both parties were not clearly defined. Some contracts did not even go through the approval process. Problems such as power-based contracting, short-term contracting, and low-efficiency contracting were prominent. The masses had many complaints. There was friction between policies and laws. Policies were adjusted based on changing situations, but legal clauses could not be arbitrarily changed. In rural areas, once a contract dispute arises, both parties have their reasons. The village's ultimate authority is "big stability, small adjustment," perfecting the contract responsibility system, which aligns with the relevant policies of various levels of party committees; while the contractors emphasize the full implementation of the contract, and the contract should not be arbitrarily modified or terminated. This makes it difficult to resolve contract disputes.

2. Ideological work has not kept up. After the contracting issues were exposed, the grassroots leaders neglected timely policy education and did not do detailed ideological work to reasonably adjust the contract or jointly discuss solutions. Instead, they had a weak sense of legal awareness, believing they had the right to modify or abolish the contract, resulting in increasingly complicated problems.

3. The "green-eyed monster" still exists. At present, some people ignore the material and labor inputs of the contractors. When the contractors' inputs turn into income, they become envious and jealous, leading to seizures and creating incidents.

The contract dispute in the 6th production team of Dianzi Village teaches us that how rural economic contract disputes are resolved directly affects the progress of rural reform and construction. To resolve contract disputes, work should be done from multiple angles.

1. Administrative mediation. The focus should be on township mediation. Relatively speaking, township leaders are familiar with the situation and have a better understanding of rural policies. They should rely on policy propaganda, legal education, and ideological and political work to mediate, which is beneficial for resolving contradictions at the grassroots level.

2. Court adjudication. When handling such cases, the court should first determine whether the contract is valid according to the Economic Contract Law and the opinions of the Supreme People's Court on the implementation of the Economic Contract Law. Completely valid contracts should be strictly enforced, completely invalid contracts should be immediately abolished, and partially invalid contracts should be corrected according to regulations. The court should also pay attention to its working methods. It should timely report the situation to the township party committee and government, seek their opinions, and obtain their support and cooperation.

3. Use typical cases to guide case handling. The court, judicial, and industrial and commercial departments should organize forces to handle some representative cases, compile typical cases, and distribute them to relevant parties to guide work.

4. Formulate local temporary regulations. The county people's congress should instruct relevant departments to formulate detailed regulations or temporary regulations based on laws and current policies, combined with local realities. These should be discussed and approved by the people's congress and distributed throughout the county for reference and implementation.

5. Tax adjustment. For contracts with significant income disparities and obvious irrationalities, with significant public complaints, economic measures can be used to solve the problem through the collection of value-added tax, personal income tax, and adjustment tax.

    茶怨
    ——“哄抢现象”剖析
    4月下旬，我县店垭镇垭子口村6组村民向明刚承包的4亩茶园，被本组20多名群众哄抢。事发以后，村里提出，承包人或适当增加上交提留指数，或退回投入和管理费用，转包他人。承包人向明刚以村里单方撕毁合同为由，于6月20日向店垭镇法庭起诉。法庭经多次协商调解，双方才于9月10日达成维持原合同协议。
    我们发现，造成类似纠纷的原因主要有：
    承包合同较粗糙。我县山林和多种经营承包大都是1984年秋天落实的。当时，由于工作做得不细，致使合同内容简单，双方责、权、利规定不够明确，有的甚至没有履行审批手续。仗权承包、短期承包、低效承包等问题也很突出。群众对此意见颇大。政策和法律发生一定的磨擦，政策根据变化了的情况进行了调整，而法律条款不得随意变动。在农村，一旦发生合同纠纷，双方都有理可讲。村组的尚方宝剑是“大稳定、小调整”，完善承包责任制，符合各级党委的有关政策规定；而承包者则强调全面履行合同，不得擅自变更或解除合同。这就使承包合同纠纷难以解决。
    思想工作没跟上。承包问题暴露后，基层领导忽视及时的政策教育，不是去做细致的思想工作，以求合理调整合同，或共商解决问题的办法，而是法制观念淡薄，认为自己有权变更或废除合同，结果疙瘩越结越大。
    “红眼病”仍然存在。现时，有些人对承包者付出的物资投入、劳动投入视而不见，当承包者的投入转化为收入时，眼红、嫉妒，以致哄抢，制造事端。
    垭子口村6组这类合同纠纷给我们的启示是，农村经济合同纠纷解决得如何，直接关系、影响农村改革和建设的进程。解决承包合同纠纷，应多方面做工作。
    行政调解。重点是乡镇调解。相对来说，乡镇领导情况熟，对农村政策了解比较多，要依靠政策宣传和法制教育及思想政治工作做调解工作，有利于把矛盾消化在基层。
    法庭裁决。法庭办理这类案件首先要依照经济合同法及最高人民法院关于贯彻执行经济合同法若干问题的意见，认定合同是否有效。完全有效应当坚决履行，完全无效应当即废除，部分无效应按规定予以纠正。再就是要注意工作方法。应及时向乡镇党委、政府通报情况，征求意见，求得配合和支持。
    运用典型案例指导办案。法院、司法、工商等部门组织力量，选择办理一些有代表性的案件，编印典型案例，发至有关方面，指导工作。
    制定地方性暂行规定。县人大可责成有关部门，依照法律和现行政策，结合本地实际，拿出细则或暂行规定，经人大讨论通过，印发全县参照执行。
    税收调节。对现实收入悬殊，存在明显不合理，群众意见大的承包合同，还可以运用经济手段，通过征收增值税、个人所得税、调节税的办法来解决。
