A 71-meter-high, 264-meter-long dam has recently risen in the gorge north of Qiabuqia Town in Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, at an altitude of 3281 meters.

As the curved gate opens, a massive flow of water, accompanied by drizzling autumn rain, gushes out and cascades into the Huanghe Basin. The Republican County, which has maintained a livestock inventory of over a million head (units) for 30 consecutive years, will finally end its drought. The Panchen Lama Erdeni Qojye Gyatso, who has always been concerned about this highest-altitude water reservoir, can now rest in peace...

During his lifetime, the Panchen Lama visited Republican County multiple times. The water shortage affecting nearly 100,000 Tibetan and Han people weighed heavily on his mind. Together with officials from the prefecture and county, he drew up the blueprint for the Gouhou Reservoir. Leaders such as Li Peng, Yao Yilin, and Tian Jiyun all provided support. Construction began in August 1985. In July 1987, the Lama personally inspected the construction site. Who could have foreseen that on January 28 of this year, he would suddenly pass away. Officials and workers in Haixi, along with the 800 employees of the 20th Bureau of the Ministry of Railways who were contracted to build the project, were plunged into grief. To address the funding shortage, the prefecture's party secretary Dong Zhuji, after attending the Lama's memorial service in Beijing, immediately began soliciting 20 million yuan from various sources. Due to the fractured rock and design changes, the workload increased. Vice General Manager of the China Railway Engineering Corporation He Nengjin and Director of the 20th Bureau Kong Qingyun rushed to the construction site from Beijing and Xi'an, respectively. To ensure the project's progress, the builders willingly forwent bonuses and reduced salaries...

In the high-altitude gorge, the winding road, over 300 vehicles and machinery are in full operation. Kong Qingyun, who was once the political commissar of the "Tiger Division" of the Luan River Diversion to Tianjin project, now works 16 hours a day on the plateau, battling chest pains and gallbladder issues. Doctors had just removed the intravenous drip from Kong in the construction shed when he returned to the site. He Nengjin, coughing up blood, was pulled into the county hospital by Dong Zhuji, but the next day, he was nowhere to be found. Namu Cuo, a Tibetan girl from the Gouhou River, brings cup after cup of butter tea to the builders every day.

Drops of sweat have forged the Gouhou Dam; trickles of water flow into the high-altitude lake. The water supply for 30,000 residents of the Huanghe Basin, agricultural production, and the water shortage for 30,000 livestock have been resolved, fulfilling the Panchen Lama's long-held wish.

    为了班禅大师的遗愿
    本报记者　郅振璞
    一座高71米、长264米的大坝，最近在青海省海南藏族自治州海拔3281米的恰卜恰镇北的峡谷耸起。
    随着弧形闸的启开，巨大水流和着绵绵秋雨喷涌而出，泻向共和盆地。连续30年牲畜存栏数保持百万头（只）的共和县从此结束旱荒。始终关心这座海拔最高水库的班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞大师，可以含笑九泉了……
    班禅大师生前多次到共和县，近10万藏汉群众缺水状态萦绕在他心头。他和州、县干部一道，绘制了沟后水库的蓝图。李鹏、姚依林、田纪云等领导同志都给予支持。1985年8月工程破土。1987年7月，大师亲临工地视察。谁能料到，今年1月28日，他突然圆寂。海南干部群众和承包工程的铁道部20局800名职工，沉浸在悲痛之中。为了解决资金短缺，州委书记东主加在北京参加完大师的追悼会，就四处奔波要了2000万元。由于石质破碎、设计变更，工作量增加。中国铁道建筑总公司副总经理何能金、20局局长孔庆云，先后从北京、咸阳赶往工地。为了全力保工程，建设者们宁愿停奖金、减工资……
    高原峡谷，公路盘旋，300多台车、机具在紧张运转。孔庆云，曾是引滦入津的铁道兵“老虎团”政委，如今在高原每日工作16小时，胸肌炎、胆囊炎缠身。医生在工棚刚为孔局长拔下输液针管，他又上了工地。何能金咳嗽吐血，东主加把他拉进县医院，第二天查房就没人影了。沟后河畔的藏家少女纳木措，每天把一杯杯奶茶端给建设者们。
    滴滴汗水，浇铸成沟后大坝；涓涓细流，汇向高原平湖。共和盆地3万居民用水，工农业生产和3万牲畜缺水问题迎刃而解，班禅大师夙愿得偿。
