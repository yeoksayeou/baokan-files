Once you enter Cairo's city center, you will find yourself unknowingly immersed in a sea of cars. The roads are filled with cars, and in front of and behind buildings, cars are parked side by side, basking in the sun. Even in narrow alleys, cars stir up clouds of dust.

Egypt's capital, Cairo, has over 4 million vehicles, with an average of 500,000 cars on the road every hour. On average, every four Cairo residents own one car!

In this "grand symphony" of cars, small vehicles are the stars. Apart from luxurious and stable German Mercedes-Benzes, durable and fast French Peugeots, fuel-efficient and beautiful Japanese Mazdas, and small and agile Italian Fiats, the most numerous are the black-and-white marked taxis. The roof lights of these taxis have the phrase "God willing," which adds a sense of security.

Driving is a trivial skill for Cairo residents. It is said that, except for the president and the prime minister who have dedicated drivers, anyone who owns a car drives it themselves. However, I have personally seen President Mubarak drive hundreds of kilometers to Alexandria.

Cairo rarely sees bicycles, and motorcycles are also rare. Ordinary families, whether old or new, usually have a small car. For wealthy families, parking two or three cars in front of their homes is not unusual. Therefore, small cars have become companions and helpers in the daily lives of citizens. People use cars for work, shopping, visiting friends, or going on outings, even to neighboring countries for sightseeing. It is convenient to go and come back. For those with better financial situations, driving around the city with family after work or meals is a great pleasure. For those with tighter budgets, they might buy a car and use it as a taxi, picking up a passenger or two on the way to work and dropping them off, and then running a few more trips after work, easily covering the day's living expenses and car maintenance costs.

When I first arrived in Cairo, I had an illusion: the young men and women here seemed to be "unfamiliar with each other." Not long after, I realized the secret: at dusk, under the phoenix trees by the roadside, many cars have couples inside, leaning on each other, sharing the sorrows of the day. When the moon rises above the willows, lovers meet after sunset. The romantic scene in a foreign country is arranged so uniquely and reasonably. In this Islamic country where men and women are separated, cars have become a good place for young men and women to express their love and avoid prying eyes.

After living in Cairo for a while, you will find that the Nissan cars, which are known for their convenience, fuel efficiency, and light weight, are surprisingly unpopular in Cairo. This is because Cairo residents "don't mind spending money on fuel, but they hate spending money on car repairs."

Driving in Cairo involves some risks because Cairo residents drive recklessly and impatiently. Even though there are lanes for three cars, they insist on squeezing in four or five. There is no concept of overtaking from the left; drivers just seize any opportunity to weave through and speed ahead. So, bumping into each other has become a common occurrence. Even if you try not to "bother" others, you can't always "avoid" them. Your car might get a "kiss" from a car behind you at any moment. Although drivers are used to this, it is hard on Nissan cars with plastic bumpers.

How do Cairo residents without cars get around? The extensive public transportation system will take passengers to every corner of the city. Buses are large, with single-deck and double doors. Passengers usually board from the back door, buy tickets, and exit from the front door.

The courage and skill of Cairo residents in chasing and boarding buses are unimaginable. If someone wants to catch a bus, they don't need to go to the station; they just need to wave their hand, and most drivers will slow down to help. Passengers then quickly rush forward and jump onto the moving bus. If they can't get on, the driver won't help them, because picking up passengers along the way is not the driver's job. I once saw a plump woman, when the bus was turning, lift her long skirt and rush onto the bus in three steps. Looking back, she saw that her slippers had fallen on the roadside about ten meters away. She couldn't get off or walk away, so she could only sigh at her lost slippers...

Cairo's traffic system is quite advanced. However, with over 4 million cars crowded into this space, the congestion is unimaginable. Especially during peak hours, the ten-kilometer-long October 6th Bridge is often jammed, and cars can only move forward inch by inch. Add to that the murky exhaust fumes and rolling heatwaves, making it unbearable.

But at night, the cool breeze disperses the heavy and polluted air, and the city lights up with neon lights from tall buildings, cars leave strings of pearls, and the Nile River under the lights on both banks sends waves of affection. Cairo is truly charming and moving.

In my opinion, the most interesting scene in Cairo's nightlife is driving around the city and enjoying the night view of Cairo.

    漫话开罗的车
    马晓霖
    一进入开罗市区，就会发现不知不觉已融入了一个汽车的海洋。马路上挤来挤去的是车，楼前房后肩并肩晒着太阳的也是车，寻常巷陌里卷起团团烟尘的还是车。
    埃及首都开罗拥有大小汽车400多万辆，平均每小时的车流量达50万辆，平均每四个开罗人便拥有一辆车！
    在这“浩浩荡荡”的汽车“大合唱”中，小汽车是当然的主角。除了豪华平稳的德国“奔驰”、耐用善跑的法国“标致”、省油美观的日本“马自达”、小巧灵活的意大利“菲亚特”等私家车外，数量最大的要数涂有黑白两色标志的出租车了。它的车顶彩灯上有“安拉保佑”的字样，让人凭添几分安全感。
    开车对开罗人来说是谁都能拿得起放得下的雕虫小技。据说，除了国家总统和政府总理有专职司机外，凡有车的人皆各司其车。然而我却亲眼见过穆巴拉克总统亲自驱车数百公里去塞得港。
    开罗罕见自行车，连摩托车也是稀有之物。一般光景的人家或新或旧都有一辆小汽车。至于豪门富户，楼下停上两三辆车并不稀奇。因此，小汽车成了市民日常生活里的伙伴和助手。人们或上班、或购物、或访友、或郊游，甚至到邻国去观光都开车，来去两方便。家境宽裕的，工余饭后携老带少满城兜风，不失为一大乐趣；日子紧巴的，索性买辆车兼开“出租”，上班时顺道捎上个把客人，下班后再跑几趟，一天的生活费和养车钱便绰绰有余了。
    乍到开罗，我有个错觉：这里的青年男女似乎“授受不亲”。时隔不久，我才看破了其中的奥妙：日落星明时刻，路边凤凰树下的许多小车里对对爱侣相依相偎，尽情诉说一日的别愁离绪。月上柳梢头，人约黄昏后。异国的情场竟安排得如此奇特而又合乎情理。在这个男女有别的伊斯兰国度里，汽车竟成了青年男女谈情说爱、避人耳目的好去处。
    在开罗住久了，就会发现以起止灵便、省油轻巧而横行世界各地的日产车在开罗却倍受冷落。因为开罗人“不怕花钱买油，就怕掏钱修车”。
    在开罗开车，要冒一定的风险。因为开罗人开起车来风风火火，急不可耐。明明是三辆车并行的车道，偏要亲亲热热地挤上四五辆；超车没有靠左行驶一说，车主只要逮着空儿，便见缝插针，窜前去了。所以你磕我、我碰你已成了家常便饭。就算你能不“惹”别人，却也未必能“躲”得过去，说不定你的车什么时候就被后面的车子Kiss一下。虽然车主们早习已为常，相顾无怨，但天长日久，以硬塑料作保险杠的日产车就难以招架了。
    无车的开罗人怎么出门呢？四通八达的公共交通车辆会把乘客送到市区的每一个角落。公共汽车车体高大，单厢双门。乘客一般后门上车买票，前门下车走人。
    开罗人追车扒车的胆量和功夫难以想象。若有人想搭车，不用进站，只消一招手，司机大都会减速给予方便。乘客便在汽车减速的霎那间紧赶几步，飞身登车。上不去的，司机可不会帮忙帮到底的，因为中途搭客本不是司机份内的事儿。我曾目睹一胖大嫂，乘汽车拐弯的当儿，手拎长裙摆，三步并作两步抢上车去。回头一看，脚上趿着的拖鞋早已落在十几米外的马路边。她欲下不得，欲走不忍，只得望鞋兴叹……
    开罗市交通立体化颇具规模。然而400多万辆车挤在这块空间里，其拥挤程度可想而知。尤其到了上下班的高峰期，长达五公里的十月六日公路立交桥常常被堵得水滞不通。汽车只能一米一米地往前挪动。再加上混浊的废气、滚滚的热浪，令人难以忍受。
    但到了夜晚，缕缕凉风吹散了凝重污浊的空气，市内华灯齐放，高楼大厦霓虹万紫千红，车流撒下串串明珠，再加上两岸灯影下的尼罗河水在频送秋波，开罗真是柔姿万千、楚楚动人。
    依我看，开罗夜生活里最有趣的一幕，莫过于驾车兜风，夜游开罗。
