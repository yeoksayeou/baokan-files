Reporter Jiang Jianke reports: At the closing ceremony of the first national science popularization newspaper and periodical experience exchange conference held today, more than 100 representatives from all over the country discussed and explored the achievements, quality, and future development directions of China's science popularization newspapers and periodicals.

Since the founding of the People's Republic, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the science popularization newspaper and periodical industry in China has developed significantly. The number of science popularization newspapers and periodicals at the provincial level and above has increased from just over a dozen at the beginning of the founding of the People's Republic to more than 120 today, with an annual circulation of 100 million copies (issues). There are more than 2,000 science popularization newspaper and periodical workers.

These science popularization newspapers and periodicals have actively promoted the Party's science and technology policies, disseminated scientific knowledge and information, and popularized a large number of scientific and technological achievements and practical technologies. They have cultivated a group of scientific and technological reserve talents. In recent years, during the practical technology training and scientific and technological poverty alleviation process, science popularization newspapers and periodicals have played a significant role, bringing scientific and technological achievements to every household.

The conference emphasized that it is necessary to correctly promote the Party's policies and guidelines, vigorously disseminate and popularize scientific and technological achievements and related information that can be directly converted into productive forces. At present, it is necessary to focus on promoting scientific and technological workers who are dedicated to the rejuvenation of China, actively guide the broad masses to cultivate civilized and scientific living habits, and build socialist spiritual civilization.
