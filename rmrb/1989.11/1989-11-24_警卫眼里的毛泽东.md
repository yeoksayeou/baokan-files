In the ward of the Public Security Hospital, I found He Qinghua, who was hospitalized for a leg operation. During the war years, he served as a bodyguard for Mao Zedong for a full ten years. He eagerly recounted to me the days of traversing Shaanxi...

At that time, Mao Zedong had four bodyguards responsible for his daily life and personal security when he went out. Additionally, there was a pistol squad responsible for guarding his residence. Chairman Mao worked sixteen to seventeen hours a day. As soon as he got up in the morning, the bodyguards would inform the secretary to bring all the telegrams and documents to his desk. After Mao took a walk, he would start working, often forgetting the time. Lunch had to be reminded several times before he would eat. The bodyguards would think of various ways to make Mao rest. If there was a performance at a theater, they would prepare in advance and then ask for permission, urging him to go and watch, thereby letting him rest a bit. Sometimes, if he didn't want to go, the bodyguards would say, "Chairman, the theater has sent someone to remind you, they are waiting for you to start, otherwise, it will be difficult for everyone to begin." As soon as Mao agreed, they could set off immediately. Mao had a habit of taking a walk in the courtyard after finishing his work at night, often thinking about problems during his walk. Because his attention was highly concentrated, he often bumped into trees. The bodyguards would instruct the on-duty sentries to remind Mao not to bump into the trees.

Life in Yan'an was extremely hard, and Mao's meals were very simple, mostly consisting of coarse rice, bean rice, a small dish of vegetables, and a bowl of soup. Sometimes, even the soup was not made separately. He told the cook, Zhou Xilin, "You don't need to make soup separately, that's too troublesome, just mix the leftovers with hot water." Sometimes, the cook saw that Mao had been working all night, his eyes red from fatigue, so he would cook a bowl of noodles with some cabbage hearts and an egg, and send it to him. Mao would then get upset, saying that everyone was suffering, and he should eat the same as his comrades. His meals should not exceed the budget. Sometimes, at the end of the month, he would ask Zhou Xilin to show him the accounts, and if there was no excess, he would be very satisfied.

He kept his birthday a secret and did not let the people around him know. Once, when the bodyguards were discussing their birthdays, they realized they didn't know when Mao's birthday was, so they sent He Qinghua to ask. Mao said, "Why ask this? It's a secret." And he didn't say anything more. Sometimes, Mao would suddenly remember and casually tell the cook, "Today, make a few dishes, I have some wine here, let everyone come over and have a meal." But no one knew it was his birthday at that time. It was only after the founding of the nation that he would see the people around him on his birthday and take a group photo, so everyone knew his birthday for the first time.

Mao never cared about his clothes, always wearing an old, patched gray cotton jacket, with many places mended. His socks also had two large holes. Bodyguard He Qinghua was afraid he would freeze his feet, so he bought some camel hair, spun it into thread, and knitted a pair of wool socks to give to him. Mao saw them and asked, "Wool socks, where did you get these?"

He Qinghua said he bought some camel hair and knitted them himself. Mao smiled, "You have such a skill?" Then he asked, "Where did you get the money?"

He Qinghua said it was brought from home when he enlisted. Mao then told the platoon leader to give He Qinghua his straw shoe allowance. He Qinghua refused, so Mao pretended to be angry and said, "If you don't take my money, I won't take your socks." He Qinghua had no choice but to accept the straw shoe allowance. He wore these socks for six winters. Later, in Yangjialing, he saw that the cook Zhou Xilin had no socks to wear, so he gave the wool socks to him.

In June 1947, He Qinghua left the Chairman because of a foot injury, shedding tears as he did so. After the founding of the nation, he really wanted to visit, so he wrote a letter expressing this wish. Soon, he received a call from Mao's secretary, inviting his whole family to visit on a Sunday. In the afternoon, a car sent by Mao picked up He Qinghua's whole family and took them to Zhongnanhai. The secretary told him, "The Chairman is very busy, he hasn't rested from yesterday to this morning, and just fell asleep. The Chairman instructed before sleeping that you should eat first when you arrive, and then watch a cultural performance."

In the evening, Chairman Mao received them in his bedroom and chatted enthusiastically with them for nearly an hour. When it was time to part, He Qinghua took out a notebook and asked Mao to write "Mao Zedong" in it.

This was the only gift He Qinghua took from Chairman Mao...

　　警卫眼里的毛泽东
    常敬竹
    在公安医院的病房里，我找到了因腿部手术来这里住院的贺清华。在战争年代，他作为一名警卫员跟随毛泽东长达十年之久。他激动地向我讲述起那些转战陕北的岁月……
    那时毛泽东身边一共有四个警卫员，负责照顾他的日常生活并担负他外出的随身警卫任务。另外，还有一个手枪班负责他的驻地警戒。毛主席每天要工作十六七个小时，早晨他一起床，警卫员就去告诉秘书，将电报、文件全部抱回来放到桌子上，等毛主席散完步回来后就开始办公，一工作起来就忘了时间，中午饭要警卫员催几次才肯去吃。警卫员变着法子让毛主席休息。哪个剧场有晚会，他们就事先准备好再去请示，劝他去看，借此让他休息一下；有时不想去，警卫员就说：“主席，剧场已经来人催了，等着您去哩，不然大家不好开场。”只要毛主席一答应，就可以马上出发。毛主席有个习惯，晚上工作完了，喜欢在院子里散散步，散步时也常常考虑问题，因注意力高度集中，常会碰到大树上去，警卫员就让值班的哨兵注意提醒毛主席，不要碰到树上去。
    延安的生活非常艰苦，毛主席的饭菜也极其简单，大都是二米子饭、豆豆饭、一两碟小菜、一个汤。有时做汤也不让另做，对炊事员周西林说：“不用专门做汤，那样麻烦，把剩菜用开水兑起来就行了。”有时炊事员看到毛主席彻夜工作，眼睛都熬红了，就为他煮碗挂面，放些白菜心，再打上一个鸡蛋送去，他就不高兴了，说现在大家都苦，我应该跟同志们一样，我的伙食不能超支。有时，到了月底，他还叫周西林把条据给他过目，看到没有超支，就非常满意。
    对自己的生日，他一直保密，不让身边的工作人员知道。有一次，警卫员们在一块谈论自己的生日时，才记起来还不知道毛主席什么时候生日，就派贺清华去问。主席说：“问这个干什么？保密。”就不再搭理他了。有时毛主席自己忽然记起来，就不动声色地对炊事员说：“你今天做几个菜，我这里有酒，大家聚过来一块吃顿饭。”但那时谁也不知道是他的生日。直到建国后他生日时，才会见了身边的工作人员，并一块合影留念，这样，大家才第一次知道了他的生日。
    毛主席对穿衣服从来不讲究，总是身穿那套又旧又破的灰布棉衣，上面许多地方补了补丁，袜子也破了两个大窟窿。警卫员贺清华怕他冻坏了脚，就跑到街上买了点驼绒，自己捻线织了一双毛袜子给送去，主席一看说：“毛袜子，哪来的？”
    贺清华说是我买了点驼绒自己织的。毛主席笑了：“你还有这种手艺？”又问他：“你哪里来的钱？”
    贺清华说是参军时从家里带来的，毛主席就让班长把他的草鞋费给贺清华，贺清华不要，毛主席就装出生气的样子说：“你不要我的钱，我也不要你的袜子。”贺清华只好收下草鞋费。这双袜子他穿了六个冬天。后来在杨家岭看到炊事员周西林没袜子穿，就把毛袜子送给了他。
    1947年6月，贺清华因脚部负伤，含泪离开主席，建国后，很想去看望，就写信倾诉了这个心愿。很快接到了他的秘书的电话，约了一个星期日请他们全家去做客。下午4点钟，派来的汽车把贺清华全家接去中南海。秘书告诉他说：“主席工作很忙，从昨天到今天上午一直没有休息，现在刚睡觉，主席睡前吩咐说，你们来了，先吃饭，然后去看文艺节目。”
    晚上，毛主席在卧室里接待了他们全家。兴致勃勃地同他们交谈了近一个小时。临分别时，贺清华拿出一个笔记本让主席题下了“毛泽东”三个大字。
    这是贺清华从毛主席身边带走的唯一的一份礼物……
