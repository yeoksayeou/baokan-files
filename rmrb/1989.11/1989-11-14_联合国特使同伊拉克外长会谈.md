Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, November 12th.

United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar's envoy Jan Eliasson met with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz today to discuss the issue of Gulf peace.

According to the Iraqi News Agency, the focus of the talks was on how to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 598. The resolution calls for a comprehensive and lasting peace in Iraq, Iran, and the entire region.

Eliasson said late on November 11, after arriving in Baghdad from Tehran, that he hopes his shuttle diplomacy between the two countries will lead to the implementation of Resolution 598, which serves as the basis for peace talks between the two countries.

Eliasson began his shuttle visits to the two countries on October 31, aiming to help the peace talks, which have been at a standstill since May this year, break out of the current impasse.

    新华社巴格达11月12日电  联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔的特使简·伊莱亚森今天同伊拉克副总理兼外长阿齐兹再次举行会谈，讨论海湾和平问题。

    伊莱亚森11日晚在从德黑兰抵巴格达后对记者说，他希望这次对两伊的穿梭访问能使598号决议得到实施，这项决议是两伊和平谈判的基础。
    伊莱亚森是10月31日开始在两伊穿梭访问的，其目的是使今年5月起陷入僵局的和谈能从困境中解脱出来。
