    世界杯羽毛球赛告一段落
    中国选手大多获得小组出线权
    本报广州11月17日电　记者黄振中报道：今天是世界杯羽毛球赛小组循环最后一天，决定各路战将的出线命运。经过近4个小时的苦战，我国选手出线的有：男单杨阳、赵剑华，女单韩爱平、唐九红和黄华，女双林瑛、关渭贞和孙小青、周蕾，男双李永波、田秉毅，混双蒋国良、农群华。名将熊国宝可惜未能出线。
    我国两名小姑娘黄华和唐九红在决定出线的关键时刻，既发挥出快速多变的特点，又表现出沉着稳定的良好心理素质。她们经过3天的激战，仍体力充沛，这是李玲蔚退役后，我国羽毛球女子后备力量的一次合格考试。
    今天杨阳状况极佳，轻松地战胜印尼名将苏吉亚托。赵剑华对印尼罗天宁丢掉第一局后，连扳两局才闯过险滩。
    获小组出线的选手中，男单还有丹麦选手帕·霍耶拉森和马来西亚的傅国强，女单有印尼的王莲香，男双有南朝鲜的朴柱奉、金文秀和印尼的洪忠中、郭宏源，混双有南朝鲜的朴柱奉、郑明熙和金文秀、郑素英等。
