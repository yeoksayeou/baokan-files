Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 27th.

Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea, stated at a press conference he held this morning that the war in Cambodia is not a civil war but a struggle by the Cambodian people to liberate their country.

Prince Sihanouk said that although Vietnam announced in September that it had completely withdrawn its troops from Cambodia, this has not been recognized by the international community. The Cambodian resistance forces demand that the United Nations send an international inspection body to verify Vietnam's alleged "complete withdrawal." He said that in reality, Vietnam is still pursuing colonialism in Cambodia. Under these circumstances, I will not give up the struggle against Vietnam. Because any peace that does not bring 100% independence to Cambodia and does not fully restore the self-determination of the Cambodian people is unacceptable.

For this reason, he proposed that to achieve a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian problem, an international inspection body of the United Nations should be established in Cambodia, and a United Nations peacekeeping force should be dispatched. Under the supervision of the United Nations international inspection body and the United Nations peacekeeping force, all parties in Cambodia should completely disarm. If the proposal for complete disarmament is rejected, each party in Cambodia should reduce their forces to 10,000. The remaining troops should be completely disbanded, and their weapons and ammunition should be collected and destroyed by the United Nations international inspection body and the United Nations peacekeeping force. At the same time, the 10,000 troops from each of the four Cambodian factions should also be restricted to barracks designated by the United Nations international inspection body and the United Nations peacekeeping force.

The proposal also calls for the dissolution of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (although it has been officially recognized by the United Nations) and the illegal Hun Sen-Heng Samrin puppet regime, to be replaced by a provisional four-party united government that includes the Khmer Rouge. Its task is to organize free and fair elections under the supervision of the United Nations. Otherwise, any form of elections held in Cambodia would be illegal and invalid.

Sihanouk emphasized that before free and fair elections can be held in Cambodia, before Vietnam truly withdraws completely from Cambodia, and before the United Nations peacekeeping force is stationed in Cambodia, only the Democratic Kampuchea is the sole legitimate government, and no one can change the seat of the Democratic Kampuchea in the United Nations.

Sihanouk also answered questions from reporters.

### 全面政治解决柬埔寨问题　西哈努克亲王提出新建议

　　全面政治解决柬埔寨问题
　　西哈努克亲王提出新建议
    本报北京11月27日讯　记者孙毅报道：民柬主席诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王今天上午在他主持的中外记者招待会上指出，柬埔寨战争不是内战，这是柬埔寨人民所进行的一场解放祖国的斗争。
    西哈努克亲王说，越南宣布在今年9月已从柬埔寨境内全部撤军，但这并没有得到国际社会的承认。柬埔寨抵抗力量要求联合国派遣国际监督机构检查越南所谓“全部撤军”的诚意。他说，事实上越南仍然在柬埔寨推行殖民主义，在这种情况下，我不会放弃抗越斗争。因为任何的和平如果不能给柬埔寨带来百分之百的独立，不能百分之百地恢复柬埔寨人民的自决权，都是不能接受的。
    为此他提出建议，为全面政治解决柬埔寨问题，应该在柬埔寨设立一个联合国国际监督机构，并派遣一支联合国维持和平部队，在联合国国际监督机构和联合国维持和平部队的监督下，柬埔寨各方全面解除武装。如果全面解除武装的建议遭到拒绝，柬埔寨各方应裁军至1万。其余的军队全部解散，他们的武器弹药由联合国国际监督机构和联合国维持和平部队收缴后予以销毁。同时，留下来的柬埔寨四方的各自1万军队也应限制在由联合国国际监督机构和联合国维持和平部队指定的兵营内。建议还要求解散民柬联合政府（尽管它得到了联合国的正式承认）和非法的洪森—韩桑林的伪政权，由一个包括红色高棉在内的四方临时联合政府所代替，它的任务是在联合国的监督下组织自由公正的大选。否则，柬埔寨进行的任何形式的大选都是非法和无效的。
    西哈努克强调指出，在柬埔寨举行自由公正的大选之前、在越南真正全部从柬埔寨撤军之前、在向柬埔寨派驻联合国维持和平部队之前，只有民主柬埔寨才是唯一合法的政府，任何人都不能改变民柬在联合国的席位。
    西哈努克还回答了记者的提问。
