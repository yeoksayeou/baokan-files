On a sunny autumn day, a man in his eighties received three groups of reporters in succession at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. Despite his age, he was full of energy, speaking eloquently and reminiscing deeply about past events, his words filled with profound affection for China. He is Arkhipov, who from 1950 to 1958 led a large group of Soviet experts to help China build 156 engineering projects. These projects played a crucial role in China's industrial development. More than thirty years have passed, and a wave of reform has swept across China, bringing about tremendous changes. It is at this moment that Arkhipov and many other Soviet experts who had worked in China, to participate in the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the founding of New China, were invited as representatives of the Soviet Union's Society for Friendship with Foreign Countries and the Soviet-China Friendship Association to visit China.

Among the white-haired members of the delegation, there were experts who had built the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, geologists who had traveled extensively across China, air force heroes who had flown to China in 1938 to help in the war of resistance, teachers who had trained countless students in China's aerospace and aviation fields, and sinologists who had dedicated their lives to cultural exchanges between the two countries. Most of them had devoted the prime of their lives to China.

Arkhipov had many old friends among China's elder statesmen. On the night of National Day, on the Tiananmen Rostrum, in the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People, and in the reception room of the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, they met again. Old friends meeting, the conversation naturally began with reminiscing. Arkhipov joyfully told Bo Yibo, "Before coming to China, I looked through the old photos. We were so young then. I hugged Li Fuchun tightly, and you were also very strong, lifting me up..." What particularly moved Arkhipov was that he saw Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun, Li Xiannian, Peng Zhen, Yao Yilin, and many other old comrades he used to be with. He also met Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, the new generation of Chinese leaders. These days, his heart was filled with excitement, and he could hardly sleep at night. He told the reporter that he and all the experts who had worked in China especially admired and missed Zhou Enlai. Before coming to China, he gathered the delegation members and said to them, "Let us wear the Sino-Soviet Friendship Medals given to us by China. They were personally presented by Zhou Enlai and are the highest honor China has bestowed upon us." During the visit, they often wore the friendship medals alongside the medals and awards they had received in their home country.

Stralyeva, who had taught at the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, continued to train personnel for China after returning to Moscow in 1957. Now, some of her students have become key figures in China's aerospace and aviation fields. After a deeply emotional meeting with her former students, she told the reporter with tears in her eyes, "I see that the efforts I made back then laid the foundation for their future growth. This is a great comfort and encouragement to me, and I am proud of it." On the construction site of the Qiantang River Bridge, the bridge expert Sulin was surrounded by a group of people. They were the builders of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. Friendly words and warm smiles made him extremely moved.

In May of this year, Chairman Gorbachev visited China, and the relationship between the two parties and countries was normalized, which made these old warriors particularly happy. Although they are advanced in age and most have retired from their original positions, they all hold positions in the Soviet-China Friendship Association and want to dedicate the rest of their lives to the cause of Sino-Soviet friendship. Of course, the cooperative relationship between the two countries today is far from what it was in the 1950s, and everything is developing on a new basis. The bridge expert Sulin strongly advocates for the establishment of a joint venture bridge design and construction company between the two countries to serve third countries. Professor Stralyeva has enthusiastically introduced the situation in New China to the Soviet public, publishing two books about China, "The Yangtze River Flows On" and its sequel. This time, she came to China to tell the Soviet people about the new face of China. She has already started writing her third book, tentatively titled "My Friend, China." Arkhipov, who has retired from the position of First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, retains his position as Vice Chairman of the Soviet-China Friendship Association as his only job. He told the reporter, "I will use this authority to actively promote relevant units in China through the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to push the friendly cooperation between the two countries to a new stage." He said, "I am happy for you. Your reforms are well thought out, and the reforms have brought you significant results." He expressed that after returning home, he would tell the experts who had worked in China, "Now we must learn from China." He believes that the past economic relations between China and the Soviet Union, where China was mainly the buyer, were determined by the conditions of that time, but today is different. China now has a powerful industry, especially electronic products that are very popular. Now we are equal partners. He emphasized that in the future, the economic relations between the two countries must be based on mutual benefit, and only then can economic cooperation have a broad prospect.

    话当年  献余热
    ——苏中友协老战士代表团访华侧记
    本报记者　周象光
    金秋时节的一天，和煦的阳光撒满大地。一位年过八旬的老人在钓鱼台国宾馆连续接待了三批记者的采访。他精力充沛，侃侃而谈，深情地回忆起多年前的往事，言谈中饱含着对中国的深厚感情。他就是新中国成立之初于一九五零年至一九五八年领导一大批苏联专家帮助我国建设一百五十六个工程项目的阿尔希波夫。这些建设项目在我国工业发展中起着重要作用。如今，岁月流逝了三十多年，中国大地上掀起了改革的浪潮，发生了巨大的变化。正是在这样的时刻，当年为中国人民的建设事业洒下汗水的阿尔希波夫和许多在华工作过的苏联专家，为参加新中国成立四十周年的庆祝活动，作为苏联对外友协和苏中友协老战士代表团应邀访问了我国。
    这些白发苍苍的代表团成员中，有当年修建武汉长江大桥的专家，有足迹遍及我国各地的地质学家，有一九三八年驾机来我国帮助抗战的空军英雄，有在我国航天航空领域桃李满天下的教师，以及一心为两国的文化交流献身的汉学家等。他们大都把自己一生中最年富力强的一段时光献给了中国。
    阿尔希波夫在中国老一辈的领导人中有许多老朋友。在国庆之夜的天安门城楼、在人民大会堂的宴会厅、在钓鱼台国宾馆的迎宾室里，他们又重逢了。旧友重逢，话题自然从叙旧开始。阿尔希波夫欣喜地对薄一波同志说：“来华前我翻看了当年的照片，那时我们多么年轻，我紧紧地搂抱着李富春，而你那时也很有力气地把我抱起……”使阿尔希波夫特别激动的是他又见到了当年经常在一起的邓小平、陈云、李先念、彭真、姚依林等老同志。同时他也见到了江泽民、李鹏等中国新一代领导人。这些日子，他激动的心情久久不能平静，夜夜几乎总是难以入睡。他告诉记者，他和所有曾在中国工作过的专家特别敬佩和思念周恩来。来华前，他把代表团成员召集在一起，对他们说：“让我们把中国授予我们的中苏友谊纪念章戴上吧，那是周恩来亲自送给我们的，也是中国给我们的最高奖赏。”在访问期间，他们常常把友谊纪念章同他们在国内荣获的勋章、奖章并排地别在胸前。
    曾在北京航空学院任教的斯特拉热娃，一九五七年回国后在莫斯科航空学院继续为中国培养人才。如今她的一些学生已成为我国航天航空领域的骨干。在充满深情的师生会面之后，她眼里噙着泪花对记者说：“我看到自己当年付出的心血为他们日后的成长打下了基础，这是对我的莫大安慰和鼓励，我为此感到自豪。”在钱塘江大桥工地上，桥梁专家西林被一群人围了起来。原来他们是当年武汉长江大桥的建设者。友好的话语，热情的笑容使他万分激动。
    今年五月，戈尔巴乔夫主席访华，两党两国关系实现了正常化，这些老战士们为此格外高兴。他们虽然年事已高，大多已从原来的岗位上退了下来，但他们都在苏中友协任职，要把余生继续献给苏中友好事业。当然，如今中苏两国的合作关系远非五十年代可比了，一切正在新的基础上发展。桥梁专家西林极力主张两国合资成立桥梁设计建设公司，为第三国服务。斯特拉热娃教授曾经热心地向苏联公众介绍新中国的情况，出版了两本介绍中国的书《长江在那里奔流》及其续集，此次来华，又准备将中国的新面貌告诉苏联人民，她已开始撰写第三本书，书名定为《我的朋友，中国》。已从苏联部长会议第一副主席的岗位上退下来的阿尔希波夫，苏中友协副主席是他保留的唯一职务。他对记者说：“我要利用这个职权，在国内积极推动各有关单位，在中国通过中苏友协，把两国的友好合作推向新的阶段。”他说：“我为你们高兴，你们的改革是经过深思熟虑的，改革已为你们带来了重大成果。”他表示，回国后要对曾在中国工作过的专家说，“现在我们必须向中国学习”。他认为，过去的中苏经济关系，中方主要是买主，那是当时的条件所决定的，今天则不同了，中国已有了强大的工业，尤其电子产品很受欢迎，现在我们是平等的伙伴。他强调，今后两国的经济关系必须建立在互惠互利的基础上，这样经济合作才可能有广阔的前景。　（题照为本报记者陈志摄）
