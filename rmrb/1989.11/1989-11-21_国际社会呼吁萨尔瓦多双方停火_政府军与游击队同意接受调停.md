Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, November 18th.

The United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar on the 17th once again called for an immediate ceasefire in El Salvador, and stated that he would submit a request to the UN Security Council on Monday for the Organization of American States to urgently dispatch "blue helmet" (peacekeeping) troops to El Salvador. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States, João Clemente Baena Soares, said he would rush to El Salvador on Sunday to mediate.

The civil war in El Salvador has drawn serious international concern. Many Latin American countries have called for a ceasefire. The Mexican government issued a statement last night strongly urging both sides in El Salvador to cease fire and resume negotiations, continuing the reconciliation process that began with talks in Mexico in September and in Costa Rica in October. Mexico, Spain, the European Community countries, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers, and other national governments and international organizations, as well as Pope John Paul II, strongly condemned the murder of six priests, including the rector of the Central American University (Jesuit School) in San Salvador, Ignacio Ellacuría. The U.S. State Department demanded that the Salvadoran government investigate the incident.

The fighting in San Salvador has been ongoing for a week. Under the bombardment of the government's air force, the guerrilla lines have somewhat contracted, but both sides are still engaged in fierce battles in the northern part of the city.

Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, November 19th.

The Archbishop of San Salvador, Arturo Rivera y Damas, said today that the warring parties in El Salvador, the guerrillas and the government forces, have agreed to mediation by the Church and the Organization of American States. The Secretary-General of the Organization of American States, João Clemente Baena Soares, who went to mediate, arrived in San Salvador today.

According to reports, since the guerrillas launched a strong offensive on the night of the 11th, over a thousand people have been injured or killed on both the government forces and the guerrillas, and more than a thousand civilians have been injured or killed in the crossfire.

　　政府军与游击队同意接受调停
    本报墨西哥城11月18日电　记者郭伟成报道，联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔17日再次呼吁萨尔瓦多双方立即停火，并表示将在星期一向联合国安理会提交美洲国家组织申请向萨尔瓦多紧急派遣“蓝盔”（和平）部队的要求。与此同时，美洲国家组织秘书长苏亚雷斯说，他将于星期日赶赴萨尔瓦多调停。
    萨尔瓦多内战引起了国际社会的严重关注。许多拉美国家呼吁双方停战。墨西哥政府昨晚发表声明，强烈要求萨尔瓦多双方停火，重开谈判，把今年9月在墨西哥谈判及10月在哥斯达黎加谈判开始的和解进程继续下去。墨西哥、西班牙及欧洲共同体各国、拉美经济委员会、美洲地区劳动者联盟等国家政府与国际机构及教皇保罗二世强烈谴责对圣萨尔瓦多中美洲大学（耶稣学校）校长伊格纳西奥·埃利亚库利亚等6名教士的谋杀。美国国务院要求萨政府对此进行调查。
    圣萨尔瓦多战事已经持续一周，在政府军空军的轰炸下，游击队的战线有所收缩，但是，双方仍在城北一带进行激烈战斗。
    本报墨西哥城11月19日电　圣萨尔瓦多大主教里维拉—达玛斯今天说，交战中的萨尔瓦多游击队与政府军已经同意由教会与美洲国家组织进行调解。前往调停的美洲国家组织秘书长苏亚雷斯于今天到达圣萨尔瓦多。
    据报道，自11日晚游击队发起强大攻势以来，政府军和游击队已有千余人伤亡，在战火中伤亡的居民也逾千人。
