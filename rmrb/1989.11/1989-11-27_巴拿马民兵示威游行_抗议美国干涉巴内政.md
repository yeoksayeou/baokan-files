Xinhua News Agency, Panama City, November 25th.

Thousands of Panamanian militiamen and state workers took to the streets of the capital today, braving heavy rain to protest against U.S. government interference in Panama's internal affairs and a plot to assassinate Defense Forces Commander General Manuel Noriega.

From 8 a.m., the main protest groups, composed of the "Dignity Brigade" and the "Committee for the Defense of the Homeland and Dignity," among others, marched through the capital's main streets and squares carrying national flags and anti-American banners. Armed with automatic rifles and other weapons, they chanted slogans such as, "Yankees go home!" and "For sovereignty, we will not retreat!"

Over the past year and a half, the United States has escalated its diplomatic pressure, economic sanctions, and military threats against Panama. The Los Angeles Times revealed on November 16 that the U.S. government plans to spend $3 million on a secret operation codenamed "Panama 5," aimed at kidnapping or assassinating Noriega and other military and political leaders. This news immediately sparked outrage among Panamanians.

Since November 21, Panamanian militiamen and paramilitary forces, with the support of the Defense Forces, have conducted live-fire exercises in the capital's suburbs, along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, and in the canal zone. These exercises included parachute jumps, obstacle courses, raids, and sniper training, demonstrating their readiness to fight to the death to defend the country's sovereignty and dignity if U.S. forces invade.

The elite "2000 Unit," established five years ago to defend the Panama Canal and take full control of its defense by the year 2000, conducted a parachute drop near the canal on November 23, transporting some militiamen to a simulated battlefield in the canal zone.

Residents of the canal zone also took to the streets, waving national flags to block U.S. military tanks and vehicles from passing through their neighborhoods. Residents and bus drivers in the town of Albrook, 12 kilometers from the capital, have twice formed human chains and placed buses across the road to prevent U.S. military convoys from passing through.

The Panamanian government promptly issued a statement protesting the U.S. government's plot to assassinate General Noriega, warning that the U.S. would be held responsible for any terrorist acts against Noriega. The National Assembly, exercising its legislative powers, passed a resolution on November 22 declaring a state of "total alert" and calling on the government to declare a "national state of emergency" to counter the U.S.'s "brazen acts of aggression."

　　巴拿马民兵示威游行
　　抗议美国干涉巴内政
    新华社巴拿马城11月25日电　（记者胡泰然）巴拿马首都成千上万民兵和国家工作人员今天冒着大雨，上街示威游行，抗议美国政府干涉巴拿马内政，阴谋杀害国防军司令诺列加将军。
    从早晨8点起，主要由“尊严大队”和“保卫祖国和尊严委员会”等民兵和准军事人员组成的示威队伍，高举着国旗和反美横幅标语，手持自动步枪等武器，在首都主要街道和广场集会游行。他们高呼：“美国佬滚回去！”“为了主权，决不后退！”
    近一年半来，美国对巴拿马的外交压力、经济制裁和军事恫吓不断升级。美国《洛杉矶时报》11月16日透露，美国政府计划用300万美元执行一项名叫《巴拿马5号》的秘密行动，阴谋劫持甚至暗杀诺列加等军政领导人。这一消息立即激起巴拿马人的极大愤怒。
    从11月21日起，巴拿马民兵和准军事人员在国防军配合下，连续在首都郊区、太平洋和大西洋沿岸运河区举行跳伞、越障、奔袭、狙击等实战演习，表示要在美军一旦入侵时，就为保卫国家主权和尊严血战到底。
    专为保卫巴拿马运河和2000年全面接管运河防务而在5年前建立的精锐部队“2000年营”23日在运河附近举行空降演习，把一部分民兵运到了运河区模拟战场。
    运河区居民也涌上街头，举着国旗阻挡驻扎在运河区的美军出动坦克和军车从他们家门口通过。离首都12公里的阿拉伊罕镇居民和公共汽车司机已经两次组成人墙，并把汽车横在路心，阻止了美军车队的驶过。
    巴拿马政府及时发表声明，抗议美国政府阴谋杀害诺列加将军，警告美国政府要对谋害诺列加的任何恐怖主义罪行负责。行使议会职权的全国区代表会议22日通过决议，宣布全国进入“总戒备”，并要求政府宣布开始“全国紧急状态”，以对付美国“明目张胆的侵略”行径。
