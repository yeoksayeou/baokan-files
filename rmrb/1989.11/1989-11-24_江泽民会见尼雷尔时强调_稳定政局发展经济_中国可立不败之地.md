Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 23rd.

    General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Jiang Zemin today stated: "Currently, the most pressing issue for China is to develop the economy under a stable political situation." He said, "A stable political situation and economic development are two major issues. Solving these two issues will allow us to stand unshakable. China is not afraid of any external pressure; we are full of confidence."

    He made these remarks during a meeting with Julius Nyerere, Chairman of the Southern Commission and Chairman of the Tanzanian Revolutionary Party, who was visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese government.

    At the beginning of the meeting, Jiang Zemin said to Nyerere, "You are an old friend of the older generation of Chinese revolutionaries. I specially came from Yunnan Province to Beijing to welcome you yesterday. I am very happy to meet you."

    Subsequently, Jiang Zemin shared his views and stance on the current domestic and international situations with the guest. He said that peace and development remain the two major trends of the contemporary world. The overall trend of the international situation is easing, but it does not exclude the possibility of tension and turbulence in certain regions. Regarding some events happening in certain countries, China adheres to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. However, China will not allow any country to interfere in China's internal affairs.

    He continued, "The high level of development in the world economy and technology today makes the connections between countries even closer. Therefore, no country can close its doors to the world. This means that, on one hand, we must insist on reform and opening up, absorbing the advanced science and technology and management experience from Western countries, but we must also be very careful and resolutely resist the decadent aspects of capitalism. On the other hand, we must adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, ensuring that China's modernization, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, advances along the socialist path."

    Nyerere expressed his thanks for Jiang Zemin's introduction.

    Jiang Zemin also conveyed greetings from Chairman Li Xiannian to Nyerere, saying, "Comrade Li Xiannian was unable to come to see you because of other matters, and he specially asked me to convey his greetings to you."

    江泽民会见尼雷尔时强调
　　稳定政局发展经济
　　中国可立不败之地
    本报北京十一月二十三日讯　记者孙毅报道：中共中央总书记江泽民今天指出：目前中国压倒一切的问题就是在稳定的局势下发展经济。他说：“政局稳定、经济发展，这是两个大问题，解决好这两个问题，就可以立于不败之地。中国是不怕任何外来压力的，我们是充满自信心的。”
    他是在会见应邀来访的南方委员会主席、坦桑尼亚革命党主席尼雷尔时讲这番话的。
    会见开始时，江泽民对尼雷尔说，“你是中国老一辈革命家的老朋友了，我是昨天特意从云南省赶到北京欢迎您的，结识您感到很高兴”。
    随后，江泽民向客人介绍了他对当前国内、国际形势的看法和立场。他说，和平与发展仍然是当代的两大潮流。国际形势总的趋势是缓和，但并不排除某些局部地区的紧张和动荡。对有些国家发生的事情，中国坚持和平共处五项原则，不干涉别国的内政。但中国也绝不允许任何国家干涉中国的内政。
    他接着说，当今世界经济、科技的高度发展，使各国的联系更加紧密，因此任何国家都不可能闭关自守。这就是说，一方面我们要坚持改革开放，吸收西方国家先进的科学技术、管理经验，但对资本主义腐朽的东西则十分注意，并坚决抵制。另一方面要坚持四项基本原则，使中国的现代化在中国共产党的领导下，沿着社会主义的航道前进。
    尼雷尔对江泽民的介绍表示感谢。
    江泽民还向尼雷尔转达了李先念主席的问候，他说，李先念同志因为有事，没能来看望您，特意要我转达他对您的问候。（附图片）
