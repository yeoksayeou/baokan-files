Promoting Farmers' Surplus Grain Savings

Currently, farmers have an increasing amount of surplus grain. However, from a national perspective, China's grain production situation remains severe. Given this situation, it is suggested that the national grain department leverage existing conditions and fully utilize idle grain storage facilities in rural areas to promote grain savings. This approach has several advantages:

It alleviates farmers' concerns and boosts their enthusiasm for grain production. Due to the difficulties in storing grain at home, farmers often have to sell their surplus grain in the market or hand it all over to the state. However, since the implementation of the household responsibility system in rural areas, farmers need to rely on their own reserves for next year's grain consumption. They are always worried that if they sell their surplus grain to the state at a fixed price, they might not be able to buy grain from the state in time in case of a poor harvest. If the state opens grain savings services, it will alleviate farmers' concerns and definitely boost their enthusiasm for grain production.

It balances national grain consumption and eases grain shortages. Every year, some regions in our country experience grain shortages. By promoting grain savings, the state can allocate grain stored in state granaries by farmers in surplus regions to disaster-stricken areas, easing grain shortages. At the same time, people in disaster-stricken areas can use the grain they have stored in state granaries to help themselves, reducing the burden and pressure on the state.

It reduces grain loss by storing grain in state granaries. Currently, a considerable number of farmers store a large amount of surplus grain to prepare for disasters. However, due to household conditions and poor management, this results in significant grain loss. By promoting grain savings, farmers can store their surplus grain in state granaries for unified management, which will greatly reduce grain loss.

### 开展农民余粮储蓄

　　开展农民余粮储蓄
    现在，农民手中的余粮逐年增多。但从全国来看，我国粮食生产形势仍然严峻。鉴于这种情况，建议国家粮食部门发挥现有条件，充分利用闲置粮库在农村开展粮食储蓄。这样做有以下几点好处：
    解除农民后顾之忧，调动农民种粮的积极性。由于农村家庭保管粮食存在许多困难，农民只好把自己的余粮拿到市场上出售或全部交给国家。但是，自从农村实行农田责任制以后，农民来年吃粮还要靠自己积存，总担心把余粮平价交售给国家后，一旦遇到粮食歉收时，能否及时从国家买到平价粮。国家如果开展粮食储蓄业务，解除农民的后顾之忧，一定会更加激发农民种粮的积极性。
    调剂国家用粮，缓解粮食紧张状况。我们国家每年都有部分地区粮食歉收。开展粮食储蓄，国家可以把丰收地区农民在国家粮库储存的粮食调剂给贫困灾区，缓解粮食紧张；同时贫困灾区人民可以利用原来在国家粮库储存的粮食自我救济，减轻国家的负担和压力。
    国家粮库里储存，减少粮食损失。现在有相当一部分农民为了备灾把大量余粮储存起来，但由于受家庭条件限制和管理不善，造成粮食大量损失。开展粮食储蓄，农民把余粮存在国家粮库里统一管理，会大大减少粮食损失。
