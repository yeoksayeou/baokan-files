The U.S. Navy has experienced five accidents in the past four days. According to the Associated Press, the U.S. Navy's "Monongahila" oil tanker caught fire due to an out-of-control boiler, resulting in nine crew members suffering from smoke inhalation and one crew member being burned.

The Associated Press cited Navy spokesman Colonel Cole, who said the tanker was located 800 kilometers west of Gibraltar. The fire was successfully extinguished, but the tanker ran aground in the water.

This is the fifth incident involving the U.S. Navy since October 29. In these incidents, at least five people have died, and three ships have been damaged.

    美国海军四天发生五起事故
    据美联社报道，美国海军“莫农格希拉”号油轮一日由于一个锅炉失控而引起大火，九名船员被浓烟呛伤，一名被烧伤。
    美联社援引海军发言人科尔少校的话说，这艘油轮位于直布罗陀以西八百公里处，大火被顺利扑灭，但油轮在水中搁浅。
    这是自十月二十九日以来美国海军发生的第五起事件。在这几次事件中，至少有五人丧生，三艘舰船遭到破坏。
