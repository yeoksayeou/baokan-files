Title: Analyzing a Strange Incident

At a national-level sports meet, a provincial team of several hundred athletes all wore imported foreign-brand sportswear and shoes, the prices of which were several times or even ten times higher than domestic products. Such a decision could not have been made by ordinary staff members.

Why such a decision was made is truly baffling. Our country has so many garment and shoe factories; could they not produce satisfactory sportswear and shoes? Athletes are all young people; what kind of influence will this practice have on their thinking? We are still a poor country, and foreign exchange is precious. Spending it on importing foreign sportswear and shoes is truly unreasonable.

Recently, there have been complaints that newspapers do not publish articles advocating the use of domestic products. The situation has changed somewhat, with more articles advocating domestic products appearing. The People's Daily published an article titled "Let Domestic Products Hold Their Heads High" in large print, which was truly heartening to read. However, this issue cannot be resolved with just one or two articles. It must be repeatedly and frequently emphasized, and there must also be effective measures.

From the radio, it was heard that the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee recently made a decision to restrict the import of foreign consumer goods and suggested that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress also make a corresponding decision. The author wholeheartedly supports this timely decision and believes that the people of the entire country will also wholeheartedly support this decision.

　　析怪事一桩
　　庞观清
    在一次全国规模的运动会上，有个省代表队几百人，所有运动服和运动鞋都是国外进口的名牌货，其价格都是国货的几倍甚至十倍。这样的决定，恐怕不是一般工作人员能做出的。
    为什么要做这样的决定，实在令人费解。我们国家有那么多服装厂和制鞋厂，难道就做不出令人满意的运动服和运动鞋吗？运动员都是青年，这种做法将对他们的思想造成什么影响？我们还是个穷国，外汇很宝贵，把外汇花在进口外国运动服和运动鞋上，实在没道理。
    前些时候，有人抱怨报上没有提倡使用国货的文章。最近情况有了变化，提倡国货的文章逐渐多起来了。人民日报用大字标题刊载《让国货扬眉吐气》的文章，读了实在叫人高兴。但是，这个问题，绝非一两篇文章能解决的，不但要反复讲，经常讲，同时还要有得力措施。
    从广播中听到，上海市人大常委会最近做出决定，要限制外国消费品进口，并建议全国人大常委会也能做出相应的决定。笔者衷心赞成这个切合时宜的决定，相信全国人民也会衷心赞成这个决定。
