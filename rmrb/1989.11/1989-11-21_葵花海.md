There are no strange rocks or peaks; it gently drapes itself in a green robe, with waves rolling and stretching across the northern frontier. It blocks the white winds from the desert steppes but shows no signs of a manly spirit, remaining tranquil and beautiful, like a refined woman. Oh, Yinshan! It has inspired the emotions of poets from ancient times to the present.

A golden sea of sunflowers rolls from beneath her skirt, wave after wave, submerging the vast plains of Chule where the grass bends low and cattle and sheep graze, and the eight-hundred-li Huanghe plain, silently gazing at the surging waves of the Yellow River. The delicate petals, like scattered gold dust, curl or dance, revealing round disks that are yellow, green, or grayish-brown. Some stand tall, others droop low, some peek out shyly, and others cluster together in groups of ten or more. Each blossom seems to breathe fire, holding within it the restless soul from Van Gogh's "Sunflowers." The golden waves surge and flow, igniting my heart, burning it, and carrying me along with them.

The river lingers here, leaving swirling eddies, following the low riverbank, reflecting the dazzling flower waves, as if searching for something. Ah, Yellow River, do you remember the scorched plains sixty years ago? Do you remember a young man from Missouri, named Snow, who came here? At that time, he was only 23, breaking through layers of barriers and news blackouts to reach Chule. It was desolate and silent. He walked along the riverbank all the way to Salaqi. Hundreds of thousands of starving soldiers poured into this small county. Some collapsed by the roadside, others stretched out their withered hands at the relief stations, hoping for a bowl of gruel. He saw a young girl nestled in the arms of her dead mother. The disaster made him shudder, but the smile of death was even more shocking. Those tormented by hunger and disease, seeing a foreigner's gaze of concern and sympathy, did not reach out a hand to ask for a single coin, nor did they try to return a smile.

On the Yellow River Diversion Project site, he saw refugees whose bones were barely covered by a thin layer of skin. Their arms hung limp like straw scarecrows in the fields. It was they who raised their arms, wielded their shovels, and dug a famous canal known as the "People's Canal," hoping one day to bring Yellow River water to the parched and cracked wilderness. The smile before death, the dream before death, showed the resilience, dignity, and strength of the people of the northern frontier. Snow, with the sincerity and conscience of a journalist, wrote a long report, "Save 250,000 Lives," calling out to the world. He had planned to return home after a few months of investigation, but starting from Yinshan and the Yellow River, he embarked on a long journey of life.

Now, following the path he took, we come to the site of the old relief station. Red tomatoes, green bell peppers, purple eggplants, and yellow sand pears are spread out on the ground. An old man with white beard sits behind the stall. He still remembers the great disaster of sixty years ago. He talks about an old Taoist who sat here and saw human traffickers taking advantage of the chaos to kidnap women, dropping a black bean into a basket for each one taken away. After a few months, there were two or three baskets full of black beans. In front of the watermelon stall, a girl in a green silk shirt is selling watermelons, her voice clear and bright. "Watermelons! Salaqi watermelons! The imperial tribute!" she adds, her laughter so clear and her voice so attractive that we can't help but walk over. She picks up a watermelon with a green rind, holds it to her chest, and with a half-foot-long Mongolian knife, slices it open with a swift motion, revealing the pink juice. She places it on the scale: "Ten pounds!" Then she picks it up, slices it a few more times, and places it on a small wooden table. With a pat, the large watermelon splits into several pieces like a chrysanthemum. The skill and ease with which she does this are truly unmatched by any man from the interior. Each slice, with a "swoosh," makes me hold my breath, fearing that she might accidentally cut her chest with the knife.

The girls who have just emerged from the sea of sunflowers each hold up a sunflower head as big as a basin, eagerly offering them to us. We peel off a few seeds, long, plump, and shiny, crack them open, and find them sweet and fragrant. Who would have thought that raw sunflower seeds could be so fragrant? Hearing our praise, the girls insist on stuffing sunflower heads into our arms, forgetting to take the money. A girl with a round face boasts, "Our sunflower seeds are four times bigger than yours in the interior, plump and oily, so they must be extra fragrant. During the sunflower harvest, people from Yunnan, Guangxi, and Jiangsu all come here in cars to buy them. From the interior to the exterior, from south to north, the world over has sunflower seeds from the Huanghe Plain. And these sunflower heads, small and black, are used to press oil. Eating them nourishes the body, and even makes the skin extra bright. No wonder you all have faces like sunflowers!" The girls hide their faces behind the sunflower heads, and their laughter flies out from behind them.

Following the Yellow River, wandering in the sea of sunflowers, occasionally there are patches of green grass embedded in the golden waves. Brown-red horses of the northern frontier, black-and-white cows, white sheep, and black goats graze or lie down peacefully. A Mongolian brother leading camels comes over, and a little girl in a red shirt leading cows comes over. When they hear that we want to take a photo with them, they all smile and stand by the golden sunflowers. Only the camel does not want to leave its long journey, standing still in its place. I stroke its back, leaning my face close to its neck, and it gives me such a friendly glance. Thus, in the green waves of the sunflower sea, I and my newly made friends leave a photograph.

Far away, the endless golden waves. From "The grass bends low to show the cattle and sheep" to "Bare land for thousands of miles" to "A sea of sunflowers," time passes slowly. The great writer and journalist who began his life's journey from here is no longer in the world, and the refugees who collapsed by the Yellow River and the workers who shed their blood and sweat have long been forgotten. Only the Yellow River water that dyed the northern frontier yellow, under Yinshan and on the eight-hundred-li Huanghe plain, blooms like fire and gold, flowing freely and unrestrained.

　　葵花海
　　陈丽
    没有怪石异峰，柔柔地披一袭翠衣，海浪般起伏绵延在塞北。阻挡了来自荒漠草原的白毛风，却丝毫不显露出伟丈夫的气概，静谧，秀美，犹如娴雅的女子。阴山！引发了古今诗人多少豪情。
    金黄耀眼的葵花海涛从她的裙裾下卷过来，一浪又一浪，淹没了风吹草低见牛羊的敕勒川，淹没了八百里河套平原，和滚滚的黄河波涛默然相望。柔媚的花瓣，洒了金粉似的，或蜷曲或飞舞，托出一个个圆盘儿，或黄或绿或灰褐。有的高高仰起，有的沉沉垂下，有的微露半个脸颊，有的十几个圆盘儿簇拥在一起。一朵朵喷吐着火焰，孕含着梵高笔下《向日葵》里那躁动不安的灵魂。金波一路跃动、流泻，把我的心都点燃了，灼疼了，也跟着一路奔去。
    河水在这里流连，抛下一圈圈漩涡，沿着低低的河岸，映着光采夺人的花涛，仿佛在追寻什么。呵，黄河，你可记得60年前那一片被烈日燎焦的平野么？你可记得一个来自美国密苏里州名叫斯诺的青年么？那时，他才23岁，冲过层层关卡和新闻封锁，来到敕勒川。一片萧索，一片死寂，他沿着河岸一直走到萨拉齐。几十万饥饿大军拥进了这个小县城，有的倒毙在路旁，有的在施舍棚前伸出干枯的手等待一碗稀粥。他亲眼见到一个女孩子偎在死去的母亲怀里。灾难使他心悸，可面对死亡的微笑更令他震惊。那些为饥饿和瘟疫折磨得半死的人，看到一个异邦人投过来关切和同情的眼光，没有一个伸出手向他索要一个铜子儿，甚至试图报以微笑。
    在引黄工地上，他见到的灾民骨头外面绷着一层薄得几乎透明的肌肉。在锁骨下悬挂着两条软弱无力的胳膊，就像谷地的稻草人身上插的枝条一样。就是他们，举起胳膊，舞动铁锹，在开挖一条名闻中外的民生渠，盼望着有朝一日能将黄河水引上干焦龟裂的荒野。死亡之前的微笑，死亡之前的梦想，表现出塞北人的坚韧、自尊、自强。斯诺以一个新闻记者的真诚和良知写出了长篇报道，向全世界发出了
  《拯救二十五万生灵》的呼救。而他本准备考察几个月即返回家中，却由阴山下黄河边开始走上漫长的人生之旅。
    如今，沿着他走过的路，我们来到当年的施粥棚前，红的西红柿，青的灯笼椒，紫的茄子，黄的沙果，摆了一地，一位白须老汉坐在摊后。提起60年前那场大灾，他竟还记得。说起有个老道坐在这儿见人口贩子趁火打劫来收女人，每拉走一个就往斗里丢一颗黑豆，几个月就积了两三斗黑豆。西瓜摊前一个穿绿绸衫的姑娘却对黑豆不感兴趣，脆声叫卖：西瓜！萨拉齐的西瓜！还不忘了补上一句：皇上尝过的贡品！她的笑声那么清亮，喊声那么富有吸引力，我们不由得走过去。她挑了一只翠皮枕头瓜，抱在胸前，拿起一把半尺长的蒙古刀，哧啦一声，将瓜从头到尾直冲着胸脯拉过来，粉红色的汁水即由裂口处滴出。朝秤盘上一放，提起秤杆：“十斤！”又抱起来，嚓嚓几刀，朝小木桌上一放，手一捶，偌大个瓜就像菊花似地裂成好几瓣。那洒脱、利索劲儿，真非关内的男人可比。每下一刀，嚓的一声，我都不禁为之捏汗，怕她万一失手，刀尖划破了胸前的薄绸衫。
    那些刚从葵花海里钻出来的姑娘们，个个双手擎着脸盆那么大的花盘儿，争着递到面前。剥下几颗，又长又饱又亮，磕出仁儿，甜里透香。想不到生葵花仁儿这么香。听到夸赞，姑娘们不由分说把葵花盘塞到我们怀里，连钱也忘了收。一个脸盘圆润的姑娘夸口说，这儿的葵花籽一颗顶你们关内的四个大，仁饱油多，能不格外香？一到收葵花时，云南、广西、江苏的人都开着车来拉。关内关外，天南海北，满世界都有河套的葵花籽。还有呢，别看那些葵花盘儿小、籽黑、仁饱，专门榨油，吃了养人，连皮肤都格外光亮。难怪你们个个脸若葵花！姑娘们把脸颊藏到葵花盘后面，笑声嘀哩哩从那儿飞出来。
    沿着黄河，徜徉在葵花海里，间或有一溜溜绿草地嵌在金涛之中。棕红色的塞北马、黑白花奶牛、白绵羊、黑山羊，悠然地或卧或低头吃草。拉骆驼的蒙族兄弟过来了，放牛的穿红衫的小姑娘过来了，一听说要跟他们合影，都笑嘻嘻地依到金葵花下。唯有那头骆驼不愿离开跋涉的长途，站在原地不动。我抚摩着它的脊背，把脸挨近它的脖子，它回头给了我那么友善的一瞥。于是，在葵花海间的绿涛上，我和新结识的朋友留下了合影。
    远了，无边的金涛。从风吹草低见牛羊到赤地千里到葵花似海，岁月悠悠。昔日从这里开始人生之旅的大作家、新闻记者已不在人世，昔日倒毙在黄河边的灾民，流尽了血汗的民工也早已被人遗忘，唯有黄河水染黄的塞北葵花，在阴山下，在八百里河套平野上，开放得如火似金，流泻得酣畅奔放。
