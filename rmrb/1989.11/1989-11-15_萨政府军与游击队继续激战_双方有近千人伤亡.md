Salvadoran government forces and guerrillas continued fierce fighting today in the capital region. Reports indicate that nearly a thousand people have been killed or injured on both sides. The fighting, which had lasted for more than a day and a night, subsided slightly after midnight yesterday. However, by dawn today, both sides resumed intense combat in the northern part of the city. Currently, the guerrillas have occupied some areas in the north. Both sides are now in a stalemate. Although the government forces have deployed combat helicopters and armored vehicles, they have not been able to retake the positions occupied by the guerrillas. Moreover, both sides' positions are in densely populated areas, making it difficult for either side to advance.

The guerrillas issued a statement saying that by the afternoon of the 12th, they had killed or wounded more than 400 government soldiers, destroyed more than 10 armored vehicles, shot down three ground-based helicopters, one small plane, two helicopters in the air, and seized a large quantity of weapons and ammunition.

The government forces reported that 220 guerrillas were killed, 136 were injured, and 103 civilians were also injured.

    萨政府军与游击队继续激战
    双方有近千人伤亡
    本报圣萨尔瓦多（萨尔瓦多）11月13日电　记者郭伟成报道：萨尔瓦多游击队与政府军今天继续在首都地区激战。据报道，双方已有近千人伤亡。昨天午夜以后，持续了一天一夜多的战斗稍稍平息。但是，今天拂晓开始双方又在城北一带进行激烈的战斗。目前，游击队员占领了城北一些地区。双方目前实际处于胶着状态。政府军虽然出动了战斗直升机、装甲车，但是，未能夺回游击队占领的阵地。而且，双方依托的阵地都在人口稠密的地带，使得双方的进攻都有一定难度。
    游击队发表的公报说，到12日下午为止，游击队已打死打伤政府军400余人，摧毁10余辆装甲车，击毁地面上的直升机3架，小飞机一架；击落空中的直升机2架；缴获大批武器弹药。
    政府军方面说，游击队被打死220人，136人受伤，另有103名市民伤亡。
