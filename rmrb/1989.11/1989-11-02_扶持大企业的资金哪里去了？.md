To alleviate the shortage of production working capital in large and medium-sized enterprises, the state has recently allocated over 8 billion yuan in loans. The People's Bank of China, in accordance with the proportion of industrial output value in each province and city, has allocated these funds to the local authorities. However, many large and medium-sized enterprises report that they have not received the full amount of these funds, with some receiving very little and others receiving none at all. Where did the money go?

Investigations reveal that after the loan quotas were allocated to the provinces and cities, the situation in some places is as follows: first, the funds were dispersed; second, they were diverted for other uses, even used illegally to supplement insufficient construction investment; third, enterprises under central government control in these regions were excluded and not considered. For example, after a certain province received a loan quota of 480 million yuan, it was supposed to be used for the 18 large and medium-sized enterprises that were severely short of production working capital. Instead, the local authorities dispersed the funds to 168 large, medium, and small enterprises. Another example is a crucial raw materials industry sector, which is vital to the national economy. The state allocated 3.1 billion yuan in loans to alleviate the shortage of production working capital in its large and medium-sized enterprises. However, after distribution by the provinces and cities, only 756 million yuan was actually allocated, less than a quarter of the total.

Jiang Zemin comrade pointed out in his speech on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic: "State-owned large and medium-sized enterprises are the mainstay of China's socialist modernization construction and the primary source of state fiscal revenue. Fully leveraging their leading role is of special importance to China's economic development." The shortage of funds is a very serious problem currently faced by large and medium-sized enterprises. It threatens the normal organization of production and, if not resolved for a long time, will also affect the production preparations for early next year. The tens of billions of yuan in production working capital loans have been dispersed, endangering the production and operations of large and medium-sized enterprises and adding difficulties to the national economy. This is the result of localism and sectionalism, which prioritize local and short-term interests. They do this not entirely out of ignorance of the principle that "killing the goose that lays the golden eggs will leave no eggs to hatch." Rather, they are limited by local and immediate interests. In fact, any action that harms the overall development of the national economy will ultimately jeopardize the production and operations of departmental economies, regional economies, and even individual enterprises. Currently, the severe difficulties faced by a batch of large and medium-sized enterprises have already affected many related small enterprises. Therefore, in the allocation of production materials, such as electricity, transportation, raw materials, fuel, and loan quotas, it is necessary to support large and medium-sized enterprises that play a leading role in effective supply. It is necessary to oppose localism and sectionalism that prioritize local economic interests.

Supporting large and medium-sized enterprises to play their due leading role is to support the development of the public ownership economy. Hindering the development of large and medium-sized enterprises will also hinder the superiority of the socialist public ownership system.

    扶持大企业的资金哪里去了？
    刘兴利
    为缓解大中型企业生产流动资金短缺，最近，国家陆续拿出80多亿元贷款，由中国人民银行总行参照各省市工业总产值在全国中的比重，切块将指标下达到地方。可是，不少大中型企业反映，这笔钱他们并没完全贷到，有的数额很少，有的分文没有。那么，钱到哪里去了呢？
    据查，贷款指标下到省市后，在一些地方的情况是：一、被分散使用；二、挪作他用，甚至违纪用于补充基建投资不足；三、把中央在地方的企业排除在外，不予考虑。如某省得到4.8亿元贷款指标后，本应用于生产流动资金极为短缺的18户大中型企业，却被地方分散贷给了168个大中小企业。又比如，一个在国民经济中处于很重要地位的原材料工业部门，国家用于缓解其大中型企业生产流动资金贷款为3.1亿元，由各省市分配的结果只落实7560万元，还不足1／4。
    江泽民同志在国庆40周年的讲话中指出：“全民所有制大中型企业是我国社会主义现代化建设的主要支柱，是国家财政收入的主要来源。充分发挥它们的骨干作用，对我国经济发展具有特殊重要的意义。”资金短缺，是当前大中型企业普遍面临的一个非常严峻的问题。它威胁着当前正常组织生产，如长期不得缓解也将影响明年初的生产准备工作。几十亿元生产流动资金贷款被分散使用，危及大中型企业的生产经营，给国家经济生活增加了困难。这是从地方和局部经济利益出发的分散主义在作怪。他们这么做，并非完全不懂得“饿死老母鸡，无蛋孵鸡雏”的道理，而是局限于局部利益、眼前利益。事实上，凡做不利于国民经济发展全局的事情，最终也必然会危及部门经济、地区经济乃至于一个企业的生产经营活动。目前，一批大中型企业陷入极度困难而产生的后果，已经使相关的许多小企业有所感触了。因此，在生产资料，即电力、运力、原材料燃料供应以及贷款指标分配上必须支持对有效供给起骨干作用的大中型企业，必须反对从地方经济利益出发的分散主义。
    支持大中型企业发挥应有的骨干作用，就是支持公有制经济的发展。阻碍大中型企业发展，也会阻碍社会主义公有制优越性的发挥。
