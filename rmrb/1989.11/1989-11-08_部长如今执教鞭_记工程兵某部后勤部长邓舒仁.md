There is a saying in eastern Henan: "If you have half a bushel of grain, don't be a teacher." However, there is a department head from a certain engineering unit of the Engineering Corps with 37 years of military service who has happily become a "teacher," voluntarily teaching at a local primary school. His name is Deng Shuren.

Deng Shuren, now 60 years old, is originally from Dengzhuang, Jiazhuang Village, Chenji Town, Yongcheng County, Henan Province. In 1984, he retired and was allocated a beautiful apartment in Jinan. After a lifetime of military service, he should have been able to enjoy a few leisurely days. But he always felt restless when idle. He said, "In my youth, I taught at a primary school in my hometown for two years. After enlisting in the army, I also self-studied English. I still have some knowledge, so I might as well go back to my hometown to teach."

Deng Shuren's wife, Zhang Yumin, who was also a primary school teacher, strongly supported him. Thus, the elderly couple, carrying simple luggage, persuaded their relatives and friends who were concerned about his health, and in 1986, returned to their hometown after 39 years of absence.

Since then, Chenji Town's Jiazhuang Primary School has had a teacher, Deng, who wears a faded military uniform. He teaches four subjects: mathematics, geography, natural science, and English, with over 20 class hours per week, keeping him busy all day. During the day, he teaches classes, and at night, he visits students' homes. On weekends or holidays, he also gives extra lessons to students who are struggling academically. Zhang Yumin, who was once the "wife of the department head," is now a real "department head," taking care of all household chores and helping her husband with tutoring students and correcting homework.

Their son and daughter, who work in Jinan and Xi'an, came to visit their parents and saw their mother squatting by the stove, cooking with tree leaves, and blowing the fire with her mouth, tears streaming down her face. They felt their noses tingling and tried to persuade them to return to Jinan. Old Deng said, "Our hometown is much better than Jinan. The air is fresh, the environment is quiet, and it can even prolong life!" When their daughter had a baby, they sent a telegram asking their mother to come to Xi'an to help take care of the baby. Zhang Yumin was about to set off but suddenly thought, "No, if I go, won't I cut off Old Deng's 'supplies'?" The couple discussed it and decided to spend 50 yuan a month to hire a nanny for their daughter's family. Zhang Yumin looked west towards Chang'an with tears in her eyes but did not leave her husband's side.

This summer vacation, their son, daughter, and daughter's husband came to visit them again. Seeing that their parents were in good health, laughing and chatting, and living happily, no one tried to persuade them to return to Jinan. Instead, they all volunteered, "Dad, you are too tired. Let us teach a few classes for you!" Teacher Deng was overjoyed and praised the children for their progress. But he also said with concern, "Teaching primary school is also a big deal. Don't think that just because you are college graduates and university teachers (both daughter and daughter-in-law are lecturers at Xi'an Institute of Technology), you can be careless and waste the children's time!"

Teacher Deng's teaching quality is famous throughout the town. Many parents asked for favors and did everything they could to transfer their children from other schools to Jiazhuang Primary School. As a result, the class that Teacher Deng teaches has 62 students in the third grade, which is seriously overcrowded! However, in every town examination, the subjects he teaches always rank first or second. This summer vacation, he had the school use the primary to junior high school math test paper to test the entire third grade class, and the pass rate was over 70%.

    部长如今执教鞭
    ——记工程兵某部后勤部长邓舒仁
    苗尤志
    豫东有句俗话：“家有半斗粮，不当孩子王。”而今却有一个具有37年军龄的工程兵某部后勤部长欣然做了“孩子王”，为家乡小学义务执教，他叫邓舒仁。
    今年60岁的邓舒仁，原籍河南省永城县陈集乡贾庄村委邓庄。1984年离休后，在济南分得一套漂亮的住房。戎马一生，也该过几天清闲日子了。可他总觉得闲着难受，他说：“我青年时在老家当过两年小学教师，参军后又自学了英语，肚里还有点知识，还是回老家教书吧！”小学教师出身的老伴张玉敏大力支持。于是，老两口掂着简单的行李卷，说服了为他身体担心的亲友，1986年回到了阔别39年的故乡。
    从此，陈集乡贾庄小学来了一位身穿褪色军装的邓老师。他一人担四门课：数学、地理、自然常识和英语，每周20多个课时，整天忙得不亦乐乎。白天讲课，夜里还深一脚浅一脚地去家访。星期天或节假日，他还要给学习成绩差的学生“开小灶”。张玉敏——这位当年的“后勤部长夫人”，如今却做了名副其实的“后勤部长”，她承担了全部家务，还抽空帮助老伴辅导学生，批改作业。
    远在济南、西安工作的儿子和女儿来看父母，见妈妈正蹲在土灶前用树叶烧锅做饭，因为没风箱，还不时用嘴吹风，呛得两眼泪花，都觉得鼻子酸溜溜的，劝他们回济南。老邓说：咱老家比济南强多了，空气新鲜，环境幽静，还能延年益寿哩！女儿生孩子，打电报请妈妈去西安帮助照料一下。张玉敏正准备起程，忽又一想，不行！我走了，岂不断了老邓的“粮草”？老两口一商量，决定每月花50元给女儿家雇个保姆。张玉敏含泪西望长安，硬是没离开老伴一步。
    今年暑假前，儿子、女儿和女婿又来看望他们，见爸妈身板硬朗，谈笑风生，生活过得很愉快，谁也不再劝他们回济南了，而是纷纷请战：“爸爸，您太辛苦了，让我们替您教几天课吧！”邓老师喜得不行，连夸孩子们有进步。但他又不放心地说：“教小学可也大有学问哩。你们别以为自己是大学毕业，又是大学教师（女儿、女婿均为西安工学院讲师），马虎应付，耽误人家的孩子！”
    教小学有大学问，邓老师的教学质量在全乡是出了名的。许多家长托人说情，千方百计把在外校上学的孩子转到贾庄小学，以致邓老师所教的三年级一个班达62人，严重超员！但乡里历次统考，他所执教的学科考绩均在第一或第二。今年暑假，他让学校用小学升初中的数学试卷对三年级全班进行测验，结果，及格率达70％以上。
