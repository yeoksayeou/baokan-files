Various circles in Hebei held a gathering this morning at the Norman Bethune International Peace Hospital in Shijiazhuang to solemnly commemorate the 50th anniversary of the passing of the great international communist warrior Norman Bethune and his 100th birthday.

Hebei Provincial Party Secretary Qing Chongzhi, Bethune's former friend Lü Zhengcao, Wei Chuantong, and Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries Liu Gengyin attended the memorial meeting. Mr. Wu Dehao, Counselor of the Canadian Embassy in China, and Ms. Philipps of the Canada-China Friendship Association, along with a delegation of 10 people, also attended the event.

Hebei Province is where Comrade Norman Bethune worked, fought, and sacrificed his life.

After Bethune passed away in Tang County, Hebei, the people of Hebei buried him with the most solemn traditional Chinese funeral rites and built the Bethune Martyr's Tomb in Tang County, allowing him to rest in peace in Hebei. In 1952, his remains were reburied in the North China Martyrs' Cemetery in Shijiazhuang. The Norman Bethune International Peace Hospital, named after him, is located near the cemetery.

In his speech at the memorial meeting, Hebei Provincial Party Secretary Lü Chuanzan called on all the people of Hebei to learn from Bethune's spirit of selflessness and dedication, to carry forward the fine tradition of hard work, and to work and study selflessly at their respective posts, continuously pushing forward the cause of socialist reform and modernization.

    河北各界集会纪念白求恩
    本报石家庄11月13日电　记者陈国琦报道：河北省各界人士今天上午在石家庄白求恩国际和平医院隆重集会，纪念伟大的国际共产主义战士白求恩逝世50周年、诞辰100周年。
    河北省委书记邢崇智，白求恩生前友好吕正操、魏传统，对外友协副会长刘庚寅等出席了纪念会，加拿大驻华使馆参赞吴德豪先生、加中友协联合会菲力普斯女士一行10人也专程到会。
    河北省是白求恩同志工作、战斗过和以身殉职的地方。
    白求恩在河北唐县逝世后，河北人民用中华民族传统的最隆重的仪式安葬了他，并在唐县修建了白求恩烈士墓，使他安眠于河北大地。1952年，又把他的遗体移葬到石家庄市华北烈士陵园。以他名字命名的白求恩国际和平医院就坐落在陵园附近。
    中共河北省委副书记吕传赞在纪念会上发表讲话，要求全省人民学习白求恩毫不利己专门利人的精神，继承和发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，在各自的岗位上忘我工作、学习，把社会主义改革和现代化建设事业不断推向前进。
    大会结束后，各界代表又前往石家庄华北烈士陵园，向白求恩陵墓敬献了花圈，并参观了白求恩书画展。
