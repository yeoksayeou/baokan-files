Quality Inspector
Lü Wénxiù couldn't wait to reach the other shore of life. His childhood name barely surfaced before it was swept away by the long tongue of polio, leaving him unable to stand straight. But he didn't want to hide in his mother's sadness. He was willing to be a piece of paper in the hands of the labor resources director, thrusting himself into the friction of society and the mundane, showing off his colors. He gathered all the assets he could muster—his brain, his crippled arm, and his eagle-like eyes—to stand tall at the inspection table, creating a perfect motto for life. From then on, those who were careless dared not be careless again, those who were negligent dared not be negligent again, and even those with connections had to tread carefully through his precise thousandth caliper. Perhaps as a form of revenge, those clumsy guys and their girlfriends gradually distanced themselves from him. But when the product's ball went into the international basket, those stiff gazes were broken by surprise, the grumbles that clashed with him no longer butted heads, and even the coldness turned warm. This year, many young workers toasted his birthday, and he cried. He believed that understanding would come after the misunderstandings. He believed that even with a disabled body, one could still stand tall and form the character "人."
