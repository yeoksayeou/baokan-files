Premier Li Lays a Wreath at the Martyrs' Memorial in Nepal

Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, November 20 (Reporters Li Shiqiang and Yin Gaole) - Premier Li Peng, who is currently visiting Nepal, laid a wreath at the Martyrs' Memorial this morning.

The Martyrs' Memorial is located in the southern part of Tundikhel Square in the center of Kathmandu. It is a red-brown marble structure. The memorial's arch-shaped structure has a temple pavilion on top, which houses a bronze bust of King Tribhuvan. Below, two temple pavilions each hold the bronze busts of four martyrs. They were brutally murdered in the early 1940s for opposing the autocratic rule of the Rana family. To commemorate these four martyrs, the Nepalese government designated the 16th day of the 10th month of the Nepalese calendar (late January in the Gregorian calendar) as Martyrs' Day, a national holiday. Visiting foreign dignitaries usually lay wreaths at the memorial on this day.

　　李总理向尼烈士纪念碑献花圈
    新华社加德满都11月20日电　（记者朱士骧、印高乐）正在这里访问的李鹏总理今天上午向尼烈士纪念碑献了花圈。
    这座烈士纪念碑座落在加德满都市中心的通迪凯尔广场南面。它是一座红褐色的大理石建筑。纪念碑拱形结构上方的庙亭里安放着特里布文国王的半身铜像，下面两座庙亭分别放着四位烈士的半身铜像。他们在40年代初因反对拉纳家族的专制统治而惨遭杀害。为纪念这四位烈士，尼泊尔政府规定每年尼历10月16日（公历1月底）为烈士节，全国放假一天，来访的外国贵宾一般都到纪念碑前献花。
