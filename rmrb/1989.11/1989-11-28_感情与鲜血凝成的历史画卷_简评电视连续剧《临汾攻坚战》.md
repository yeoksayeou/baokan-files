It was quite a coincidence that when the Central Television Station was broadcasting "The Battle of Linfen," I was in Linfen, a major city in southern Shanxi Province, conducting an interview.

The local people were eagerly watching the show and discussing it passionately. When the special battle that had a significant impact on the course of the Chinese revolution 41 years ago was vividly and heroically portrayed on the screen today, one can imagine the immense waves it stirred in the hearts of the Linfen audience and the profound thoughts it evoked!

Among the many revolutionary historical themes, "The Battle of Linfen" is one of the more successful productions. The creators mined rich materials from historical facts, standing at a new historical and temporal height to grasp them, forging deep reflections on history and reality, and extolling the spirit of the Chinese Communist Party and the people's liberation army, led by them, and the broad masses of the people in their pursuit of light, their courage to sacrifice, and their invincible heroism.

The Battle of Linfen lasted for more than 70 days and nights, a prolonged siege battle rarely seen in the history of the War of Liberation. Chairman Mao Zedong once wrote an article discussing the Linfen case, which shows its importance. "The Battle of Linfen" uses thick brushstrokes and tones to depict the image of Marshal Xu Xiangqian during the Battle of Linfen. He was steady and reliable, leading from the front, far-sighted, and strategically brilliant. From the decisive attack on the airfield to the initial test of strength at the "Ox City" corner, from studying "The Art of War" in the underground cave to convening various "lords" to discuss the attack plan, from identifying the enemy's sabotage of the tunnels to manufacturing tens of thousands of pounds of explosives underground, the drama vividly portrays Marshal Xu's superb military command skills and exquisite war leadership art. The portrayal of Marshal Xu in the drama is vivid and moving. His relationship with the people and the soldiers is heart-wrenching. For example, writing a letter to Li Hai's parents, sending shoes to the soldiers, gently persuading deserters, eating the buckwheat and mountain yams given by the villagers, writing his name on his backpack, and weeping for the martyred General Wang Wen, are all ordinary yet brilliant scenes. They convincingly convey Marshal Xu's approachability and respect, and the historical inevitability of the great victory of the Battle of Linfen, a glorious chapter in his military career.

"The Battle of Linfen" reflects the battles between the enemy and us in a delicate, profound, and realistic manner. The first attack on Dongguan resulted in our army's failure, with over 3,000 casualties. The drama appropriately narrates and exaggerates this. The portrayal of the enemy, such as Yan Xishan, Liang Peiwen, Xu Qichang, and Xie Xichang, is not stereotypical or conceptual but respects history, fully displays them, and is reasonable and appropriate. The drama shows both the enemy's disintegration at the airport under air attack and the desperate struggle at the Drum Tower; both the ignorance and stupidity of the blind and dark forts under the gun, and the ferocity and cunning in the anti-tunnel war. All of this does not diminish our army's image but rather highlights Marshal Xu and our soldiers' bravery, wisdom, and the truth that "the higher the magic, the higher the way."

The scenes of the people's support in "The Battle of Linfen" are also grand and sincere. The number of people mobilized is rarely seen in recent military war films, thus producing a grand effect. The spirit of "the army wins battles, the people are the backbone" is not only embodied in representative figures like Hong Dabang and Sun Xiuying but also permeates the battle scenes of men, women, old, and young eagerly supporting the front. To dig tunnels, the people pushed carts, carried goods with donkeys, pulled doors, sent wood, and even donated coffins. Moreover, 200,000 door panels miraculously appeared in one night, paving the way to victory. These seemingly simple scenes convincingly reaffirm an eternal truth.

"The Battle of Linfen" also has many new explorations in artistic expression. Television dramas have their own intrinsic qualities, determining that they possess a unique aesthetic character different from films, and thus television dramas should have artistic means different from film stories. "The Battle of Linfen" has done this quite perfectly. Apart from the uniqueness of the subject matter and the layout of the form, in the description of the war process and the soldiers' external actions, and the emphasis on portraying the characters' personalities and revealing the characters' inner emotional turmoil, it is handled neither too hot nor too cold, very appropriately. The actor Li Xuetong, who plays Xu Xiangqian, has a good grasp of the role. The creators have also discovered a group of quite representative characters, such as Li Hai, Sun Tiezhu, Wu Zhanqun, Sun Xiuying, and Hong Dabang, moving from the characters' appearance to their psychology, from the characters' single personality to their multiple personalities, in artistic handling, not falling into the rut, and blazing a new trail. It is particularly worth noting that "The Battle of Linfen" does not avoid the cruelty and suffering of war and its tragic side to people's fate but shows our army's bravery and unstoppable might in the unity of revolutionary heroism and tragedy.

    感情与鲜血凝成的历史画卷
    ——简评电视连续剧《临汾攻坚战》
　　王晋军
    很巧，中央电视台播放《临汾攻坚战》时，我正在晋南重镇临汾采访。
    当地人们争观此剧，议论风生。当四十一年前那场对中国革命进程产生过重要影响的特殊战役真实地、艺术地、英勇悲壮地再现于今日荧屏时，可以想象在临汾观众心灵中所掀起的波澜是多么巨大！所衍生的思考又是何等深沉！
    在诸多重大革命历史题材的片子中，《临》剧是拍得比较成功的一部。创作者从历史史实中发掘丰富的素材矿藏，站在新的历史和时代高度来把握，熔铸对历史与现实的深层思考，弘扬中国共产党人及其领导下的人民解放军和广大人民群众为追求光明的勇于献身精神和所向披靡的英雄气概。
    临汾战役经历了惊心动魄的70多个昼夜，在解放战争战史上，这么长时间的攻坚战是罕见的。毛泽东同志曾撰著论述临汾战例，可见其举足轻重。《临》剧以浓重笔墨、色调塑造了临汾战役中徐向前元帅的形象。他稳健持重，身先士卒，深谋远虑，运筹帷幄。从当机立断奔袭飞机场到戬砍“卧牛城”犄角初试锋芒，从战地窑洞潜心阅读《孙子兵法》到召集各路“诸侯”研究攻城计划，从辨清敌人破坏坑道的手段再到制造几万斤炸药的地下“土飞机”，刻画烘托出徐帅高超的军事指挥才能和精湛的战争领导艺术。剧中对徐帅的描摹有血有肉，他与人民群众，与战士的血肉关系感人肺腑。譬如，给李海父母写信，为战士送鞋，对逃兵循循善诱，吃老乡送的莜面山药旦，背包上写名字，痛哭殉难的王墉旅长等，都是非常平凡而又精彩的情节。它令人信服地感到徐帅的可亲可敬，感到作为他军事生涯中辉煌篇章的临汾攻坚战大捷的历史必然性。
    《临》剧对敌我之间的战斗反映细腻、深刻，也十分逼真。第一次打东关我军失利，伤亡3000多人，剧中作了比较恰当的叙述和渲染。写敌人如阎锡山、梁培璜、徐其昌、谢锡昌等，不脸谱化、概念化，而是尊重历史，充分展示，合乎情理，恰如其分。剧中既有敌在机场空运遭袭击的溃不成军，也有祭鼓楼垂死挣扎的杀机毕露；既有枪口下连失明碉暗堡的蒙昧愚蠢，也有反坑道战中的凶残狡诈。这一切非但丝毫无损我军形象，却更反衬出徐帅和我军将士有勇有力，多智多谋，表现了魔高一尺道高一丈的真谛所在。
    人民群众的支前场面在《临》剧中也表现得壮观宏大，朴实率真。它所调动的人力之多，是近年来军事战争片所不多见的，因此也就产生了壮观效果。“军队打胜仗，人民是靠山”的精神不仅体现在洪大伯、孙秀英等代表人物身上，而且充溢于男女老少踊跃支前的战斗画面里。为了打坑道，人民群众拿车推，用驴驮，拉门板，送木料，甚至连棺木也献出来，更有20万块门板一夜间神话般冒出来，铺就了一条通向凯旋的坦途。这些看似简约的画面令人信服地再次证实了一个永恒真理。
    《临》剧在艺术表现方面还有许多新探索。电视剧有其自身的本体内质，决定它具有区别于电影的独特的审美品格，因而电视剧应具有与电影故事片迥然不同的艺术手段。《临》剧比较完美地做到了这一点。除了题材的选择、形式的布局等具有独特性之外，在描写战争进程和将士战斗的外部行动与着力刻画人物性格和揭示人物内心世界的感情波澜的结合上，也处理的不温不火，甚为得当。扮演徐向前的李学通把握得体，创作者还发掘出了一批具有相当代表性的人物，如李海、孙铁柱、武占群、孙秀英、洪大伯等，由人物外表走向人物心理，由人物性格的单一走向人物性格的多重，在艺术处理上不落窠臼，独辟新径。特别需要指出的是，《临》剧不回避战争的残酷和苦难，及它给人的命运带来的悲剧性的一面，而是在革命英雄主义和悲剧性的对立统一中显示我军的英勇无畏和无坚不摧。
