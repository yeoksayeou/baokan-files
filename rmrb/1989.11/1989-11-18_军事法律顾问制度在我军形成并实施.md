The Ministry of Justice and the General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army recently held a ceremony in the capital to award military legal advisor certificates to more than a hundred military personnel who completed the first batch of military legal advisor training courses for the entire army. This marks the formation of the military legal advisor system in the PLA.

Since the military legal advisor system first appeared in the administrative management of the Navy in early 1985, it has attracted widespread attention both within and outside the military. Practice has shown that it plays a certain role in ensuring the administrative order of the troops. By providing consulting opinions for leaders to make legal decisions and handling various disputes related to the military, it can better safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the people's army and maintain the stability of the troops.

    军事法律顾问制度在我军形成并实施
    本报讯　司法部和解放军总参谋部，最近在首都向全军首期军事法律顾问培训班百余名军队干部颁发了军事法律顾问证。这标志着军事法律顾问制度已在我军形成。
    军事法律顾问自1985年初在海军行政管理领域出现后，引起了军内外的广泛关注。实践证明，它对部队行政管理秩序有一定保障作用。它通过为首长依法决策提供咨询意见和处理与军队有关的各种纠纷事务，能够较好地保障人民军队的合法权益、维护部队的稳定。
