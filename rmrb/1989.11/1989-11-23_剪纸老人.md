She can cut leaping tigers crossing valleys, soaring dragons emerging from water, village girls picking flowers with baskets, and little cowherds playing flutes while riding cows. Her scissors carry the fragrance of mugwort, and her paper-cuts have the sweetness of fine wine.

The paper-cutting elder has countless students. Some have stood on the podiums of art academies, some have crossed the ocean to lecture in France, some students' paper-cuts are collected in art galleries, and some students' paper-cuts are published in books. The paper-cutting elder has never done these things; she simply cuts paper-cuts and takes in students.

One day, I had the fortune to meet the paper-cutting elder on a warm kang (a traditional heated bed) in a rural home. She readily agreed to cut paper-cuts for me. She casually took a piece of black paper and first cut two little butterflies ready to fly at the top, with their antennae forming a large oval; inside the oval, at the top, she cut two little mice facing each other; in the middle of the oval, she cut a little fish standing upright; below the fish, she cut four blooming plum blossoms with delicate petals. I examined this paper-cut for a long time but couldn't figure out what it was. The paper-cutting elder said it was a black cat, then placed the paper-cut on a clean white sheet of paper.

I understood. The butterflies are the ears, with the black cat's playful thoughts and lovable spirit; the mice are the eyes, with the black cat's clear beliefs and brave life; the fish is the sensitive nose, sometimes stealing a bit of scent; the four plum blossoms are the beautiful paws, giving the black cat a stable foundation; the other parts are omitted, but these are enough to tell you about the black cat's perfection.

The elder probably hasn't studied realism and romanticism, and she may not know about Van Gogh, Picasso, Qi Baishi, or Xu Beihong.

A person living in a remote and impoverished area, just to decorate her doors and windows, has developed such high skills. She yearns for a rich and colorful life, and thus the paper-cuts have miraculously gained thought. I can't help but re-evaluate the true meaning of the word "art."

The paper-cutting elder then took a piece of green paper, and the tip of her scissors flew out a giant tree. On the tree, there were instantly golden roosters with long phoenix tails, giant gourds the size of millstones, shiny dog-head dates like jade, and blooming peonies...

The elder's dim and cloudy eyes hide her keen observation of life; her nearly withered fingers create marvelous works of art; in the countryside, there are countless unnamed artists like the paper-cutting elder!

I looked up and cast my gaze out the window. In the vast expanse of yellow loess, the dull gray seemed to shimmer with bright red, purple, green, and yellow.

　　剪纸老人
　　杨同轩
    她会剪跨沟跃涧的下山虎，会剪昂首摆尾的出水龙，会剪提篮采花的俏村姑，会剪骑牛吹笛的小牧童……她的剪刀上有艾蒿的清香，她剪的窗花上有美酒的甘醇。
    剪纸老人有数不清的学生。有的登上过美院的三尺讲台，有的飘洋过海去法国讲学，有学生的窗花被艺术殿堂收藏，有学生的窗花成书出版……剪纸老人没做过这些事，她也就剪窗花、收学生。
    一日，我有机缘在一个农家的热炕上遇见了剪纸老人。她爽快地答应为我剪窗花。她顺手拿起一片黑纸，先在纸上方并排剪出两只欲飞的小蝴蝶，蝴蝶的触须圈出一个椭圆形的大圈儿；在圈内的上方并排剪出两只头顶头的小鼠；椭圆圈中间立栽着一条小鱼；小鱼下一溜摆上四朵舒展骄嫩花蕊的梅花。我端详着这幅窗花，半天也没有认出是什么。剪纸老人说是只黑猫，说完将窗花放在了一页净白纸上。
    我明白了。蝴蝶是双耳，有黑猫顽皮的思想、可爱的灵性；小鼠是眼睛，有黑猫清晰的信念、勇敢的生活；小鱼是敏鼻，偶尔也会偷点腥；四朵梅花是美丽的雪蹄，黑猫便有了稳健的依托；其它部位被省略，有这些足以告诉你黑猫的完美。
    老人可能没有研究过现实主义和浪漫主义，可能不知道梵高、毕加索或者齐白石、徐悲鸿……
    一位生活在穷山僻壤的老人，为了装饰自己的门窗，练就了这样高的技艺。她是憧憬丰富多采的生活，这窗花才奇迹般地有了思维，我不得不重新去推敲艺术这两字的真正分量。
    剪纸老人又拿起一片绿色纸，剪刀尖飞出一株巨树。那树上顷刻落上了长凤凰尾巴的金鸡，吊上了磨盘大的窝瓜，结上了翡翠般透亮的狗头枣，还盛开着艳丽的牡丹花……
    老人那昏花的浊眼掩藏着她观察生活的机敏；那已近干枯的手指，创造出了巧夺天工的艺术品；在民间像剪纸老人这样不留姓名的艺术家何止成千上万！
    我抬头将目光投向窗外，那一漠黄土塬枯燥的淡灰里似乎闪烁出嫣红、姹紫、油绿、鹅黄……
