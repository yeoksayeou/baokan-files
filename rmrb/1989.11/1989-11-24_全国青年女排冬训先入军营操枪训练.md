The winter training for the 17th National Youth Women's Volleyball Team has entered its fifth day today. However, at the training base in Zhangzhou, Fujian, the sound of the ball hitting the ground is rarely heard. It turns out that the young female volleyball players have not even touched a volleyball yet; they are currently undergoing a week-long military training.

Under the guidance of soldiers from a unit stationed in Zhangzhou, 140 team members have been organized into three platoons and ten squads, living the life of a military camp. This is the first time the volleyball community has organized such a military training activity.

　　全国青年女排冬训先入军营操枪训练
    新华社福州11月20日电　（通讯员陈继共）第17届全国青年女排冬训今天已进入第5天，然而在福建漳州女排训练基地依然难得听到排球砸地声。原来，参加冬训的青年女排姑娘们未摸排球先扛枪，正在进行为期一周的军事训练。
    在驻漳州某部战士的训导下，140名队员被编成三个排十个班，过起了军营生活。这是排球界首次组织军训活动。
