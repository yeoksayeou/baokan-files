Hainan, which suffered consecutive typhoons in October, resulting in the loss of 100 million kilograms of late-season grain and economic damages totaling 1.9 billion yuan, has launched multi-level, multi-channel production and relief efforts. The province is now seeing a lively scene of mutual aid among various industries, between officials and the masses, and between less-affected areas supporting heavily-damaged regions to rebuild their homes. The public mood remains stable.

After the disaster, the Communist Party of China Hainan Provincial Committee and the provincial government immediately dispatched two investigation and condolence teams to over 40 townships and more than 100 villages in the affected areas, covering thousands of kilometers. Their mission was to alleviate the difficulties faced by the local people. The provincial government allocated 2 million yuan from the local budget to focus on repairing the most severely damaged water conservancy projects. They also arranged for the distribution of over 5,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, as well as steel, cement, and other materials, and relief funds provided by the central government to support Hainan. The provincial commercial and supply departments formulated emergency measures for the supply of goods to the disaster-stricken areas. Various sectors of society have also fully supported the disaster areas. By November 3, more than 760 units and 40,000 individuals across the province had generously donated 4.48 million yuan, including 155,000 Hong Kong dollars, over 7,600 items of clothing, and a large quantity of medicines, pesticides, and building materials. Currently, nearly 200 million mu of late-season rice out of the total 340 million mu in the province have been harvested. The southeastern region has planted 570,000 mu of sweet potatoes, an increase of over 30,000 mu compared to the same period last year. Now, transportation and postal services have basically resumed. Schools, which suffered 2.7 million square meters of damage to their buildings, have overcome various difficulties and resumed normal teaching order.
