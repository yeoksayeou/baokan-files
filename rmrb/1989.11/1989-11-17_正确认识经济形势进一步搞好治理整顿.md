Editor's Note: The decision of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Rectification and Deepening of Reform," provides a comprehensive analysis of the current economic situation. It fully affirms the achievements of the past decade of construction and reform, realistically assesses the difficulties in economic work, and proposes guiding principles, main tasks, and basic measures for further rectification and deepening of reform. This is of great significance for China's national economy to overcome temporary difficulties and achieve healthy development. This newspaper specially opens the "Discussion on the Public Report of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee" column, welcoming contributions.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee proposed the policy of rectification and deepening of reform, China's economic situation has undergone significant changes. Correctly understanding the current economic situation and taking appropriate countermeasures based on this understanding is a major issue facing us. Now, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee has passed the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Rectification and Deepening of Reform," which scientifically analyzes the current economic situation and correctly proposes measures to solve the problems.

Currently, China's rectification work has entered a critical period. At this time, correctly understanding the situation is particularly important. In our history, mistakes have often been directly related to incorrect assessments of the situation, and incorrect assessments have often been due to underestimating difficulties. Looking at the current actual situation, I fully agree with the analysis of the economic situation in the Fifth Plenary Session. We must fully affirm the achievements, realistically assess the difficulties, and for the leading cadres at all levels of the Party, the main thing to pay attention to is underestimating the difficulties.

Although there were disturbances and counter-revolutionary riots in the spring and summer of this year, as well as sanctions from some Western capitalist countries, the rectification work over the past year has still achieved significant results: economic overheating has begun to cool down; supply and demand contradictions have eased; currency has been withdrawn relatively well; the rate of price increases has gradually slowed down; people's panic over price increases has gradually stabilized. This proves that the policy determined by the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee is correct. However, we must be soberly aware that the current economic situation is still severe: for example, since the second half of this year, the growth rate of industrial production has slowed month by month and may even experience a short-term sharp decline; economic efficiency has declined; the imbalance in the national economy has not improved; there are many factors leading to increased fiscal expenditure and reduced revenue, especially the central government's financial control is seriously insufficient, and macro-control capabilities have been greatly weakened; the disorder in the economic order is still serious; the pattern of excessive distribution of national income and total demand exceeding total supply has not changed, etc.

It should be noted that the above problems are not the result of rectification work in the past one or two years. These problems are the result of certain mistakes in economic work since the second half of 1984.

Regarding the current economic situation, we must have sufficient understanding and estimation. However, as long as the policies are correct, the difficulties can be overcome. Because: first, our difficulties occur in the context of significant development of the national economy and noticeable improvement in people's lives, which are temporary difficulties in the process of progress. We have a relatively good material foundation built since the founding of the country, especially in the past ten years, and our ability to withstand adjustments is much stronger than at any other time. Second, after ten years of reform, enterprises have a certain degree of vitality and a certain ability to overcome difficulties on their own; the socialist market system, including the commodity market and factor market, has developed to some extent, and has a certain buffering capacity for the shock brought by the adjustment; the state has published industrial policy guidelines, and macro-control also has some effective administrative and economic measures. Third, we have the experience of previous economic adjustments and overcoming difficulties. Fourth, and most importantly, we have the strong leadership of the Party, an advanced socialist system, the new leadership team elected by the Fourth Plenary Session, and the series of correct policies announced by Comrade Jiang Zemin on behalf of the Party Central Committee, as well as the important decision passed by the Fifth Plenary Session. As long as the whole Party and the people of the whole country seriously implement it, we will definitely be able to overcome the difficulties.

Currently, the rectification and adjustment of the economic structure and improvement of efficiency have entered a critical stage. Due to market stagnation, many enterprises face sales difficulties and production declines, and there have been calls to relax the "tight money" policy. From a comprehensive perspective, such calls are not conducive to the deepening of the rectification and adjustment. At this critical moment, the Party Central Committee has made this important decision, continuing to adhere to the "tight money" policy, and under the premise of controlling total social demand, truly adjusting the structure and improving efficiency. This is very timely and correct, and is the only way for us to get out of economic difficulties.

To implement this important decision of the Central Committee, first, total control must be maintained. Especially, the total control of fixed asset investment must be maintained. The projects to be cut this year must be "serious," and next year, based on this year's foundation, further cuts must be made. At the same time, the investment structure should be improved to ensure stable growth of basic industries and curb the expansion of processing industries. At the same time, control the expansion of consumption funds. Now that the market has shown some signs of easing, if we think that the tightening has been sufficient and should change the "tight money" policy, we will repeat the mistakes of previous tightening efforts that failed. This will not only lose the achievements of the rectification and adjustment, but will also plunge the national economy into new difficulties, making it even harder to manage.

Second, we must resolutely eliminate a batch of enterprises that are living off their past glory. For those processing enterprises that are high in energy, raw material, and foreign exchange consumption, have no market for their products, and have been operating at a loss for a long time, we must distinguish between different situations and resolutely shut them down and reorganize them. Generally speaking, enterprises in the production sector should be less closed and more reorganized; companies in the circulation sector should be more closed and less reorganized. In short, without "limiting the inferior," it is difficult to "support the superior," which is the price we must pay to achieve a rational economic structure.

Finally, one of the urgent tasks at present is to adjust the credit structure according to the requirements of the industrial policy to promote the rationalization of the industrial structure. In addition to allocating sufficient funds for the procurement of agricultural products such as grain and cotton, in view of the serious impact of the triangular debt caused by market stagnation on enterprise production, a certain amount of startup funds can be arranged. This time, we must learn from the lessons of previous "starts" that did not "move." We must pay attention to the "art of starting." First, we must choose the appropriate starting point. The starting point for the production of means of production should be selected in large and medium-sized backbone enterprises, especially basic industry enterprises. The starting point for the production of consumer goods should be mainly in the circulation sector, which should select and purchase goods according to market conditions and play the role of a "reservoir" for absorbing and releasing goods. Commercial departments should strengthen the work of regional coordination. At present, they should especially focus on promoting industrial products to rural areas to change the situation of more in cities and less in rural areas, and more here and less there. They should also do a good job of seasonal coordination. For important raw materials and necessities of life that seem to be in excess now but may become scarce in the future, a certain amount of extraordinary reserves can be made. This way, it will not affect the production of these enterprises, and we will have a certain power to stabilize the market in our hands. Second, the starting force should be moderate. From a philosophical point of view, "degree" is the quantitative limit for an object to maintain its qualitative characteristics. The starting force should be moderate, too small to start, too large to easily lose control. This year, the issuance of currency has been controlled, and the credit scale can be executed according to the plan. Third, the start-up should not be started all at once, but should be done in phases and batches, but the difficulties should not be passed on to large enterprises. The money lent out should be tracked and managed, with money following goods, and attention should be paid to preventing new arrears.

Since the founding of the country, we have undergone four major rounds of tightening and adjustment. Summarizing, we can find a regular phenomenon: after tightening reaches a certain intensity, the first-stage effect generally first appears in the market: the supply-demand relationship eases, the price increase trend slows down, and industrial growth slows down. At this time, if we seize the opportunity to immediately promote structural adjustment work, the second-stage effect will appear: the economic structure tends to be rational, economic efficiency improves, and the national economy enters the track of a virtuous cycle. For example, the adjustment during the three years of difficulty was like this. If we hesitate and do not immediately start structural adjustment, we will lose all our previous efforts. In 1985 and 1987, the two rounds of tightening did not reach a certain intensity, and the first-stage effect had not yet appeared, so they stopped halfway and relaxed control. As a result, due to the rebound of the tightening force, it caused even greater expansion.

To correctly play the historical role of rectification and adjustment, we should regard the three-year rectification and adjustment plan as a link between the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" and the "Eighth Five-Year Plan." When we start to draft the "Eighth Five-Year Plan," we should also connect it with the 2000 target. According to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions, we should also consider the first fifty years of the next century. We should not be confused by the current difficulties, but should stand on the present and look to the future. For example, the construction of basic industries and infrastructure, population control, the rational development and utilization of resources, and the protection of the ecological environment are all long-term plans, and we should have a long-term plan.

    正确认识经济形势进一步搞好治理整顿
    马洪
    编者按：党的十三届五中全会通过的《中共中央关于进一步治理整顿和深化改革的决定》，全面分析了当前的经济形势，充分肯定了十年来建设和改革的成就，如实估计了经济工作中面临的困难，提出了进一步治理整顿和深化改革的指导方针、主要任务和基本措施。这对于我国国民经济克服暂时的困难、实现健康发展具有重大意义。本报特辟“学习党的十三届五中全会公报笔谈”专栏，欢迎来稿。    
    自从党的十三届三中全会提出治理整顿、深化改革的方针以来，我国经济形势发生了一些显著的变化。正确地认识当前的经济形势并据此采取正确的对策，是摆在我们面前的重大问题。现在，党的十三届五中全会通过了
  《中共中央关于进一步治理整顿和深化改革的决定》，科学地分析了当前的经济形势，正确提出了解决问题的措施。
    当前，我国的治理整顿工作已经进入一个关键时期。在这个时候，正确地认识形势尤为重要。我们历史上犯错误往往同对形势的错误估量直接有关，而错误估量往往又是对困难估计不足。就当前实际情况来看，我完全同意五中全会中对经济形势的分析，我们既要充分肯定成绩，又要如实估计困难，就党的各级领导干部来说，主要应该注意的是对困难估计不足。
    今年春夏之交，虽然发生了动乱和反革命暴乱以及一些西方资本主义国家对我国的制裁，但是，一年来我们的治理整顿工作还是取得了阶段性的显著成果：经济过热开始降温；供求矛盾有所缓和；货币回笼情况较好；物价涨幅逐渐回落；人们对涨价的恐慌心理渐趋平稳。这证明十三届三中全会确定的方针是正确的。但是，我们必须清醒地认识到，当前的经济形势还是严峻的：例如今年下半年以来工业生产增长速度逐月放慢，并有可能出现短期的陡降；经济效益有所下降；国民经济比例失调的状况尚未好转；财政减收增支的因素很多，特别是中央掌握的财力严重不足，宏观调控能力大为削弱；经济秩序混乱的现象还严重存在；国民收入超额分配、总需求大于总供给的格局也还未改变过来，等等。
    应当指出的是，上述这些问题不是近一两年内形成的，更不是治理整顿引起的。这些问题是1984年下半年以来经济工作中某些失误的结果。
    对于当前的经济形势，我们要有足够的认识和估计。但是，只要方针政策对头，困难是完全能够克服的。因为：第一，我们的困难是在国民经济有了巨大发展，人民生活有了显著改善的情况下发生的，是前进中的暂时困难。我们有建国以来，特别是近十年来创建的较好的物质基础，对调整的承受能力比以往任何时候都强得多。第二，经过十年来的改革，企业有了一定的活力，有了一定的自我克服困难的能力；包括商品市场和要素市场在内的社会主义市场体系有所发展，对调整带来的震动有一定的缓冲能力；国家公布了产业政策要点，宏观调控也拥有一些行之有效的行政手段和经济手段。第三，我们有前几次调整经济、克服困难的经验。第四，也是最重要的，我们有党的坚强领导，有先进的社会主义制度，有四中全会选出的新的领导班子和江泽民同志最近代表党中央宣布的一系列正确方针政策，又有五中全会通过的这个重要决定，只要全党和全国人民认真贯彻执行，我们就一定能够战胜困难。
    目前，治理整顿已经进入调整结构、提高效益的关键阶段。由于市场疲软，不少企业销售困难，生产下降，因此，出现了要求放松“双紧”方针的呼声。从全局看，这种呼声并不利于治理整顿的深入开展。在这个关键时刻，党中央作出了这个重要的决定，继续坚持“双紧”方针，在控制社会总需求的前提下，切实调整结构，提高效益。这是非常及时、非常正确的，是我们在经济上摆脱困难的唯一出路。
    为了贯彻中央这一重要决定，首先，总量控制必须坚持。特别要坚持对固定资产投资的总量控制。今年削减项目一定要“动真格的”，明年在今年的基础上要继续压缩。同时要改善投资结构，使基础工业稳定增长，抑制加工工业的膨胀。同时控制消费基金的膨胀。现在市场出现一定程度的缓和，如果就此认为紧缩已经到位，应当改变“双紧”的方针，那就会重犯前几次紧缩“流产”那样的错误。这不仅会丧失治理整顿已经取得的成果，而且将使国民经济陷入新的困境，更加难于治理。
    其次，下决心淘汰一批坐吃山空的企业。对于那些高耗能、高耗原材料、高耗外汇、产品无销路、长期亏损的加工企业，要区别不同情况坚决关停并转。一般来说，生产领域的企业应该少关停，多并转；流通领域的公司应该多撤少并。总之，不“限劣”就难以“扶优”，这是实现经济结构合理化必须付出的代价。
    最后，当前的迫切任务之一是按照产业政策的要求来调整信贷结构，以促进产业结构的合理化。除了拨足收购粮、棉等农产品所需的资金以外，针对市场疲软引起的三角债严重影响企业生产的情况，可以安排一部分启动资金。这次要吸取过去几次“启”而不“动”的教训，要讲究“启动艺术”。第一，要选择恰当的启动点。生产资料生产的启动点应该选在大中型骨干企业，特别是基础工业企业。消费品生产的启动点应该以流通部门为主，由流通部门根据市场情况择优进货，发挥吞吐商品的“蓄水池”作用。商业部门要加强地区调剂工作，当前特别要大力抓紧工业品下乡，改变城多乡少、此多彼少的状况。还要搞好季节调剂，对于目前表面上显得偏多、今后又可能趋紧的重要原材料和生活必需品，可以进行一部分非常规储备。这样做的好处是既不影响这些企业的生产，又能使我们手中掌握一定的平抑市场的力量。第二，要有适度的启动力。从哲学角度讲“度”是事物保持其质的特征的数量界限。启动力要适度，太小启动不起来，太大又容易失控。今年货币投放这一头控制住了，信贷规模可以按计划执行。第三，启动不能全线同时启动，要有先有后，分期分批进行，但绝不能把困难甩给大企业。贷出的钱，要跟踪管理，钱随物走，同时注意防止新的拖欠。
    建国以来，我们一共进行了四次大的紧缩和调整。总结起来，可以发现这样一个规律性的现象：紧缩达到一定的力度之后，第一阶段效应一般首先表现在市场上：供求关系缓和，物价涨势趋缓，工业速度放慢。在这个时候，如果抓住时机立即推进结构调整工作，才能出现第二阶段效应：经济结构趋于合理，经济效益提高，国民经济进入良性循环的轨道。例如三年困难时期的调整就是这样。如果犹豫不决，不立即着手调整结构，就会前功尽弃。1985年和1987年的两次紧缩，由于没有达到一定的力度，第一阶段效应尚未出现，就浅尝辄止、放松控制，结果由于紧缩力反弹的影响，反而造成更大的膨胀。
    为了正确发挥治理整顿的历史作用，我们要把三年治理整顿计划作为连接“七·五”和“八·五”计划的纽带。在我们动手编制“八·五”计划时，并同2000年的目标联系起来。按小平同志的指示，对下一世纪的前五十年也要作出考虑。我们不能为眼前的难题所困扰，而要立足现在，展望未来。例如基础工业和基础设施的建设、人口的控制、资源的合理开发与利用、生态环境的保护等都是百年大计，我们应该有长远打算。
