Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, November 14th — Reporter Zheng Shengfeng reports: High-quality candies from Guangxi may be exported to Islamic countries via Ningxia; specialty products from Xinjiang might be traded with foreign tourists in Guilin. Last week, the five autonomous regions of China held their first economic and technological cooperation joint conference in Nanning, reaching 30 intent-based cooperation project agreements.

Since 1984, the five minority autonomous regions of Guangxi, Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and Ningxia have seen their inter-regional horizontal economic cooperation gradually become more active. They have implemented over 17,000 economic and technological cooperation projects, attracting 1.63 billion yuan in funds. These cooperation projects have generated 4.4 billion yuan in new production value, 850 million yuan in new taxes and profits, and introduced and trained over 35,000 technical personnel. The total value of goods exchanged through these projects is over 7 billion yuan. At the first joint conference, representatives from the economic cooperation offices and relevant departments of the five autonomous regions discussed in depth how to fully utilize the preferential policies granted by the state to autonomous regions, and how to promote cooperation and collaboration between enterprises and industries in ethnic minority regions. This joint conference will be held annually in the future.

    加强经济技术协作共图振兴
    五自治区建立联席会制
    本报南宁11月14日电　记者郑盛丰报道：广西的优质糖果，有可能通过宁夏向伊斯兰国家出口；新疆的土特产品，或许会在桂林与外国旅游者成交。上周，我国5个少数民族自治区首次在南宁举行经济技术协作联席会，一次达成30个意向性协作项目协议。
    广西、新疆、西藏、内蒙古、宁夏5个少数民族自治区，1984年以来区际间横向经济协作已由起步而日渐活跃。它们实施经济技术协作项目已达1.7万多项，引进资金16.3亿元，这些协作项目新增产值44亿元，新增税利8.5亿元，引进和培养技术人才3.5万多人次，协进协出物资总额70多亿元。在首次举行的联席会上，5个自治区经协办及有关部门负责人就如何充分利用国家赋予民族自治区的优惠政策，推进民族地区企业间、行业间的联合与协作等问题，进行了深入探讨。这种联席会议，今后将每年举行一次。
