National People's Congress delegates hear "clean-up" report

Consider initial progress made but stress need to persist

Beijing, November 11 (Xinhua) — Today, Liu Lin, Director of the National Office for the Rectification and Cleanup of Book, Newspaper, and Audio-Visual Markets and Deputy Director of the State Press and Publication Administration, reported on the "clean-up" work at the Great Hall of the People to the National People's Congress delegates in Beijing and accepted their deliberations. The delegates believed that the "clean-up" was widely supported by the people, and that while initial progress had been made, it was not enough. They emphasized the need for long-term persistence and thorough implementation.

Vice Chairpersons of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Peng Chong, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Yan Jici, and Lei Jiequn attended the meeting. Peng Chong said that this meeting was held at the request of the delegates and that in the future, similar forms of reporting government work to the delegates would be adopted.

Liu Lin reported on the progress of the "clean-up." According to incomplete statistics, by the end of September, the country had confiscated and sealed approximately 30 million copies of illegal publications, over 400,000 audio and video tapes, shut down more than 300 criminal dens involved in the production and trafficking of pornographic materials, and legally dealt with more than 1,800 related criminals. After more than two months of effort, the national "clean-up" work has achieved initial results.

Liu Lin pointed out that to continue pushing the "clean-up" work forward, the following seven tasks must be prioritized:

	— Strengthen weak links and eliminate blind spots. Some local leaders have not fully grasped the importance of the "clean-up"; in some places, the production and dissemination of pornographic videos remain rampant; in some places, pornographic publications are still openly sold at stations, trains, and ships; some lawbreakers continue to distribute obscene materials through the postal service; many libraries and document rooms have not been properly cleaned up. We cannot be complacent, otherwise, the "yellow poison" may spread again.

	— Continue to focus on key areas and industries for the "clean-up." Some criminal gangs involved in the production and trafficking of pornographic materials have gone underground or fled to other regions, increasing the difficulty of investigation and prosecution. Therefore, in key areas, it is necessary to organize a strong force including administrative management departments and public security and judicial organs, mobilize and rely on local masses to resolutely eliminate these "black dens." This is the key to the in-depth development of the "clean-up."

	— Speed up the handling of major cases. In the previous "clean-up," many cases were filed, but few were closed, and the progress of case handling was slow. The widespread phenomenon of light punishment and substituting fines for criminal penalties needs to be further overcome.

	— Continue to handle the classification of sealed publications.

	— Take decisive measures to block the sources of "yellow" materials. Implement the notice from the General Office of the Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council on compressing and rectifying newspapers and publishers, and do a good job in compression and rectification work.

	— Thoroughly rectify book and newspaper printing plants and collective and individual bookstores (stalls). In the future, new book and newspaper printing permits will be issued; township printing plants will no longer be responsible for printing books and newspapers, and county-level plants will only be allowed to print books and newspapers after approval. In the future, individual bookstores and private bookstores will not be allowed to engage in book and newspaper wholesale business; collective bookstores must meet certain conditions and, after approval, can only engage in secondary wholesale business. Printing plants and collective and individual book and newspaper operators involved in the production and trafficking of pornographic materials must be resolutely shut down.

	— Strengthen regular management to promote the prosperity of the publishing industry.

### 全国人大代表听取“扫黄”汇报  认为取得初步成效仍需抓紧抓好

    全国人大代表听取“扫黄”汇报
    认为取得初步成效仍需抓紧抓好
    本报北京11月11日讯　记者李泓冰报道：今天上午，全国整顿清理书报刊及音像市场工作小组办公室主任、新闻出版署副署长刘杲在人民大会堂向在京的全国人大代表报告
  “扫黄”工作情况，接受代表们的审议。代表们认为，“扫黄”大得人心，当前不能满足已有成绩，要长期坚持，一抓到底。
    全国人大常委会副委员长彭冲、阿沛·阿旺晋美、严济慈、雷洁琼出席会议。彭冲说，这个会议是应代表们的要求召开的，今后还要采取这种形式向代表们汇报政府工作。
    刘杲报告了“扫黄”取得的进展。据不完全统计，截至9月底，全国共收缴封存违禁书刊约3000万册，录音录像带40多万盒，取缔制黄、贩黄的犯罪窝点300多个，依法查处有关犯罪分子1800多人。经过两个多月的努力，全国“扫黄”工作取得了初步成效。
    刘杲指出，为了把“扫黄”工作继续推向深入，目前要注意克服松劲情绪和飘浮作风。为此，各地下一步要抓紧7件事：
    ——加强薄弱环节，消灭死角。有的地方领导对“扫黄”的认识有待提高；有的地方黄色录像的制作和传播仍很猖獗；有的地方车站、列车、轮船上还有黄色书刊公开兜售；一些不法分子还在通过邮局寄售淫秽物品；不少图书馆、资料室还没有得到很好的清理。我们不能麻痹大意，否则，“黄毒”还可能再次蔓延。
    ——继续抓好重点地区和重点行业的“扫黄”。一些制黄、贩黄的犯罪团伙陆续转入地下或逃往外地，增加了查处工作的难度。因而在重点地区，必须组织包括行政管理部门和公安司法机关在内的强大力量，发动和依靠当地群众，坚决攻下这些“黑据点”。这是“扫黄”能否深入的关键所在。
    ——抓紧大案要案的查处。前段“扫黄”，各地立案较多，但结案很少，办案进展缓慢。普遍存在的处罚偏轻、以罚代刑的现象，还要进一步克服。
    ——继续抓紧对已封存的出版物的定性处理。
    ——采取坚决措施堵塞
  “黄源”。要贯彻执行中央办公厅、国务院办公厅《关于压缩整顿报刊和出版社的通知》，做好压缩整顿工作。
    ——对书刊印刷厂和集体、个体书店（摊）认真进行整顿。今后要重新核发书刊印刷许可证，乡办印刷厂不再承担书刊印刷，县办厂也要经过批准，才能承印书刊。今后个体书店、私营书店一律不得经营书刊批发业务；集体书店必须具备一定条件，经批准也只能从事二级批发业务。制黄、贩黄的书刊印刷厂和集体个人书刊经营者，要坚决予以取缔。
    ——加强经常性管理，促进出版事业的繁荣。
