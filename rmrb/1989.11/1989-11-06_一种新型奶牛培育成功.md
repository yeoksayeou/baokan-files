A new breed of dairy cow has been successfully developed by the Faculty of Animal Science at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. This breed is small in size, has a low feed intake, and produces a high amount of milk. This new breed was developed by professors and experts at the faculty over a period of 20 years, based on the zebu cow.

The most notable feature of this new breed of dairy cow is its small size. Ordinary dairy cows weigh between 40 to 80 kilograms at birth, while this new breed weighs only 4 to 7 kilograms. Ordinary dairy cows weigh between 800 to 1200 kilograms when they reach maturity and start producing milk, whereas this new breed weighs only 130 to 200 kilograms. Ordinary dairy cows reach a height of 1.8 to 2.0 meters at maturity, while this new breed reaches a height of only 0.6 to 0.9 meters. Additionally, this new breed has a low feed intake. Under normal conditions, it takes 1.0 to 1.5 hectares of land to raise one ordinary dairy cow, but the same area of land can support 8 to 10 of these newly bred dairy cows.

The milk production of this new breed is already at the same level as that of ordinary dairy cows. Furthermore, this new breed has a high reproduction rate. By using the technology of in vitro maturation and in vitro fertilization of the cow's eggs, 25 to 30 embryos can be obtained. Since these embryos are very small, a single ordinary cow can receive the implantation of 4 embryos at one time.

Additionally, this new breed of dairy cow is heat-resistant and cold-resistant, and it is not picky about food, making it very suitable for individual households to raise in different regions.

Although this new breed of dairy cow has many advantages, its disease resistance still needs to be improved. The Mexican government attaches great importance to this research project and plans to allocate special funds to support the breeding of this new breed of dairy cow, with the aim of mass-producing it nationwide by the year 2000.

Currently, this research achievement has attracted the attention of the livestock research departments of some countries.

    一种新型奶牛培育成功
    泰然
    墨西哥国立自治大学畜牧系培育成一种个头小、食量少、产奶量高的新型奶牛。这种奶牛是该系教授和专家们在瘤牛的基础上，经过了20年的刻苦研究才培育出来的。
    这种新型奶牛的最大特点是：个头小。普通奶牛在出生时体重为40至80公斤，而这种奶牛则只有4至7公斤；普通奶牛在成年产奶时体重为800至1200公斤，而这种奶牛则仅有130至200公斤；普通奶牛在成年期身高为1.8至2.0米，而这种奶牛则为0.6至0.9米。食量少。在正常情况下，养活一头奶牛需要1.0至1.5公顷土地，而同样面积可养活8至10头经培育改良后的新型奶牛。产奶量高。目前新型奶牛已达到了与正常奶牛每头产奶量相同的水平。繁殖率高。利用这种奶牛的卵通过体外催熟和体外受精的技术，就可获得25至30个胚胎。由于这种胚胎体积很小，一头普通牛的母体一次就可移植4个胚胎。
    此外，这种新型奶牛具有耐热、抗寒的能力，而且不挑食，很适宜在不同地区一家一户地饲养。
    尽管这种新型奶牛有不少优点，但还需要进一步提高其抗病能力。墨政府对这项科研工作极为重视，准备拨专款支持对这种新型奶牛的培育，并计划于2000年在全国大批量地发展这种奶牛。
    目前，这项科研成果已引起了一些国家的畜牧业研究部门的重视。
