Soldiers stationed in the city of Dalian, Liaoning Province, consider it their second home. A few years ago, on a frosty winter morning, as soon as it began to lighten, crowds lined both sides of the ten-mile stretch from the railway station to Laohutian Park. The people were not waiting for a foreign dignitary or a famous person, but for 11 ordinary female cadets from the Shenyang Military Medical School returning from the Old Mountain Front with honors. Around 8 AM, as soon as the 11 cadets stepped off the train, they were immediately surrounded by the crowd. City leaders draped red sashes over them, and Young Pioneers presented them with bouquets of flowers. Accompanied by the sound of drums and pipes, the 11 cadets boarded 5 open-top jeeps, escorted by a motorcade, and left the station for their school.

The grand welcome moved these heroines, who had faced death on the battlefield without flinching, to tears. Liu Hui, who had been awarded the Second-Class Meritorious Service Medal, recalled the scene with emotion: “I am not a Dalian native, but the people of Dalian are so good! It is an honor to serve in the military in Dalian!”

Many soldiers stationed in Dalian share this sentiment. Dalian has the highest density of military personnel in the country. A large number of troops inevitably increases the burden on the city's supply of various resources. However, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Bi Xizheng and Mayor Wei Fuhai believe that having many troops is not a burden but a unique advantage for defending, building, and stabilizing Dalian.

For many years, the Dalian Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have consistently included supporting military families and veterans in their agenda, and the practice of discussing military affairs has been firmly upheld. Last year, the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government proposed the "Ten Rememberances" to support and care for the construction of the troops. For example, when the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government study and deploy work, they remember military-civilian relations and supporting military families and veterans; when planning the city, they remember the construction of the troops; during major holidays, they remember to visit the soldiers; and in economic development, they remember to help the troops solve problems and alleviate their difficulties, making the practice of discussing military affairs more specific.

"We have no secrets from the leaders of Dalian at all levels, and there is nothing we cannot discuss; what we think of can be done, and what we do not think of can also be done." When it comes to military-civilian relations, many military leaders often express their feelings this way. During the handover of the People's Armed Forces Department to the local government, Vice Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Bian Guosheng and Vice Mayor Zhang Shuhui led relevant department officials to work on-site in various districts and counties, completing the handover of the People's Armed Forces Department in all 10 districts and counties (cities) of the city in just one month. Over the past 10 years, the city has annually received approximately 1% of the nation's transferred cadres, ranking first in the country in terms of city scale and population ratio.

Dalian is a city with a glorious tradition of supporting the military. Today, under new historical conditions, the people of Dalian's enthusiasm for supporting the military is as strong as ever.

"Soldiers have the motherland in their hearts, and we have soldiers in our hearts." Wang Maokun, known as the "military-supporting secretary," from the Xigang District Minle Street Party Committee, says. Since 1982, when the street committee and a certain submarine squadron of the Navy became joint construction units, he has become a "half-owner" of the military unit. When the unit conducts ideological education, he lectures the officers and soldiers on the local situation of reform and opening up. When the unit needs funds to build a club, he confidently says, "This matter cannot be delayed, leave it to me." He quickly dispatched the street's construction team to help the unit build a large clubhouse with nearly a thousand seats and various entertainment facilities, saving the unit 70,000 yuan. In recent years, the squadron has had 35 officers' wives follow their husbands to the military, and Wang Maokun personally arranged their jobs.

Minle Street also has a famous "100 Grandmas" military support team. When officers and soldiers get married, they send congratulatory gifts; when family members visit, they pay house calls; when someone gets sick and is hospitalized, they go to visit; even when officers and soldiers have birthdays, they do not forget to come and celebrate. Every August 1st, they buy a vest or shirt for each officer and soldier in the squadron, carefully sew a pair of insoles, and every season, they ride tricycles to the unit to take the officers' and soldiers' bedding home to wash and mend. One autumn morning, they took a batch of quilts from the unit to wash, but it started raining as soon as they hung them out to dry. They lit a fire and heated the kang (traditional heated bed), some drying, some warming, some sewing, until 8:30 PM. Then they rode the tricycles again, insisting on delivering the quilts to the unit before lights out. The officers and soldiers, looking at the clean and tidy quilts and the white-haired, sweaty faces of the grandmothers, shouted, "Grandma..." and could say no more.

Currently, nearly 3,000 military support and veteran service organizations, such as "military support service teams" and "military family service centers," are active in urban and rural areas of Dalian.

In recent years, the military has served the national economic construction, and the military budget has been significantly reduced. "The military is enduring, and the people should cherish them." This military support slogan with distinctive characteristics of the times is once again resonating in Dalian. The Shenyang Military Region Military Medical School planned to establish a welding wire factory, but due to insufficient funds, it could not start construction. The officials of the Zhongshan District Party Committee and District Government generously donated 500,000 yuan to the school. The Longhai County garrison unit wanted to build a breeding farm, and the county government immediately allocated more than 200 acres of sea area and sent technical personnel to teach scallop breeding techniques, which alone earned the unit 500,000 yuan annually. More than a thousand units in the city have trained dual-use personnel for the military free of charge. Military officer college education has also been incorporated into the local adult continuing education system, and soldiers' civilian technical training has been incorporated into the local technical training system. For this, the city spends more than a million yuan annually. In recent years, the city has trained 13,000 dual-use personnel for the military.

The people of Dalian's nurturing of the soldiers has further inspired the soldiers' sense of responsibility to defend and build their "second home."

Since 1984, various units stationed in Dalian have collectively contributed more than 2 million man-days of labor and dispatched more than 50,000 mechanical vehicles to participate in and complete more than 70 major engineering and public welfare construction projects. The relevant units have also opened one military airport, 8 military wharves, and 11 railway dedicated lines for local use, making important contributions to Dalian's reform, opening up, and economic construction.

In supporting local construction, officers and soldiers are deeply praised by the masses for undertaking heavy, urgent, difficult, and dangerous tasks. During the Spring Festival last year, after a fire broke out at the Dalian International Huadian Power Plant, it urgently needed to resume production. The entire company of the Fifth Battalion of a certain anti-aircraft artillery brigade gave up their holidays and joined the battle to clear the coal pier. They braved the cold and danger, sometimes working continuously for 36 hours, and contributed to the early repair of the power plant's power generation.

On November 26 last year, the cargo ship Liaoying 105 caught fire at sea. At that time, the sea was rough with high waves, and the situation was very dangerous. The Navy quickly dispatched ships to the scene of the accident. Officers and soldiers fought against the fire and waves for three days and three nights, finally towing the 105 cargo ship to a safe water area and promptly sending 11 injured crew members to the hospital. In just the past year, the Navy units stationed in Dalian have rescued 12 ships in distress and 87 people in danger.

Various units also regard helping the local area to improve spiritual civilization as an important part of supporting the government and loving the people. In legal education, the military has sent out 130 propaganda teams, going deep into government agencies, factories, streets, and schools to give lectures 400 times, with an audience of more than 70,000 people. The Navy Political Academy has leveraged its propaganda advantages to assist three streets in establishing three "part-time party schools" and, in conjunction with the thoughts of cadres and the masses, has held a "series of lectures on reform and opening up," training more than 6,000 theoretical cadres. With the help of the military, the number of military-civilian joint construction points in the city has reached 930, of which 70% have been rated as civilized units by the province, city, and county.

　　战士的第二故乡
　　——大连市拥军爱民纪事
　　曹国强　张晶
    驻守在辽宁省大连市的陆、海、空三军将士，称这里是他们的第二故乡。一    两年前，一个屋檐挂霜的冬日，天刚放亮，从火车站到老虎滩公园的十里长街两旁就站满了人群。人们迎候的不是哪国元首，也不是知名人士，而是沈阳军区军医学校从老山前线载誉归来的11名普通女学员。8时许，11名学员刚走下列车，立即被人们包围。市领导为她们披上红缎带，少先队员献上一束束鲜花。在鼓乐声中，11名学员分乘5辆敞篷吉普车，由摩托车队护送离开车站，驶往学校。
    盛大的欢迎场面，使这些在战场上面对死神不曾皱眉的巾帼英雄，禁不住泪流满面。二等功荣立者刘慧回忆起当时的情景，仍然激动不已：“我不是大连人，但大连人民太好了！在大连当兵太荣幸了！”
    驻守在大连的军人，许多人有这样的感受。大连驻军的密度在全国是最大的。驻军多必然给城市各类物资供应增加负担。市委书记毕锡桢和市长魏富海却认为：驻军多，并不是包袱，而是保卫大连、建设大连和稳定大连得天独厚的优势。
    多年来，大连市委、市政府一直把拥军优属工作纳入议事日程，议军制度始终得到坚持。去年，市委、市政府提出了支持关心部队建设的“十个不忘”。例如：市委、市政府研究布置工作，不忘军政军民关系和拥军优属；制定城市规划，不忘部队建设；每逢重大节日，不忘慰问子弟兵；经济发展，不忘为部队排忧解难等，使议军制度更加具体。
      “我们同大连市各级领导，没有不能公开说的话，没有不能商量的事；想到的事能办，没想到的事也能办。”说到军政军民关系，许多部队领导都这样感慨地说。在人武部移交地方工作中，市委副书记卞国胜和副市长张书惠带领有关部门干部深入各区、县现场办公，仅一个月就完成了全市10个区、县（市）的人武部移交工作。10年来，全市每年接收的转业干部约占全国的1％，按城市规模和人口比例，居全国第一。二    大连是有着拥军光荣传统的城市。如今在新的历史条件下，大连人民的拥军热情不减当年。
      “战士心中有祖国，我们心中有战士。”人称“拥军书记”的西岗区民乐街道党委书记王茂坤这样说。从1982年街道与海军某猎潜艇大队结为共建单位起，他成了部队的“半个当家人”。部队搞形势教育，他为干部战士讲当地开放改革的情况。部队建俱乐部资金不足，他手拍胸脯说：“这事误不得，交给我了。”他很快派来街道施工队，帮助部队盖起一座包括近千个座位的礼堂和各类娱乐设施的大型俱乐部，为部队省下资金7万多元。这几年大队先后有35名干部妻子随军，她们的工作都是王茂坤亲自安排。
    民乐街道还有一支远近闻名的“百大妈”拥军队。干部战士结婚，她们送去贺喜礼品；家属来队，她们登门看望；有谁得病住院，她们前去慰问；甚至干部战士过生日，她们也不忘赶来祝贺。每逢“八一”，她们都要为大队每个干部战士买一件背心或衬衣，精心缝制一副鞋垫。每逢换季，她们都要蹬着三轮车到部队，把干部战士的被褥带回家中洗净、缝好。去年秋季的一天清晨，她们从部队带回一批被子拆洗，被子刚晾出去，天竟下起雨来。她们生起火炉，烧起火炕，有的烤，有的烘，有的缝，一直忙到晚上8点多钟。接着又蹬上三轮车，硬是在部队熄灯前把被子送到。干部战士望着一条条洁白干净的被子和一张张白发苍苍，汗流不止的慈祥面孔，齐声喊了声：“大妈……”就再也说不出话了。
      目前，有近3000个“拥军服务队”、
  “军人家庭服务中心”等拥军优属机构活跃在大连城乡。
    这几年，军队服从服务经济建设的大局，军费开支空额较大。“军队在忍耐，人民要疼爱。”这句富有时代特色的拥军口号又在大连叫响。沈阳军区军医学校计划筹办焊丝厂，但因资金不足，迟迟不能开工。中山区区委和区政府的机关干部慷慨解囊，集资50万元，送到学校。长海县守岛部队要办养殖场，县政府马上划出200多亩海面，并派出技术人员传授扇贝养殖技术，仅此一项就使部队每年创收50万元。全市有上千个单位全部无偿为部队培养两用人才。军官大专教学也已纳入地方成人业余高等教育的轨道，战士民用技术训练纳入地方技术培训轨道。为此，全市每年要负担上百万元的开支。近年来全市共为部队培养两用人才1.3万人。三    大连人民对子弟兵的养育之恩，进一步激发了指战员保卫、建设“第二故乡”的责任感。
    1984年以来，驻大连各部队共用200多万个劳动日、出动5万多台次机械车辆参加和完成大型工程和公益建设70多项。有关部队还开放了一个军用机场、8座军用码头和11条铁路专线供地方使用，为大连的改革开放和经济建设做出了重要贡献。
    在支援地方建设中，干部战士以承担重、急、难、险的任务而深受群众称赞。去年春节期间，大连国际华能电厂发生火灾后，急待恢复生产。某部高炮旅五营全体官兵放弃假日，投入清理煤栈桥的战斗。他们不畏严寒，不怕危险，有时连续工作36小时，为电厂提前修复发电做出贡献。
    去年11月26日，辽营105号货船在海上失火，当时海面风大浪高，情况十分危急。海军某部火速派出舰船赶往出事现场。干部战士与大火和风浪搏斗3天3夜，终于将105号货船拖至安全水域，并将11名受伤船员及时送到医院。仅去年以来，驻大连的海军部队就抢救遇险船只12艘，遇险群众87名。
    各部队还把帮助地方搞好精神建设做为拥政爱民的一项重要内容。在普法教育中，部队共派出130个宣传组，深入机关、工厂、街道和学校举办宣讲400多场次，听众达7万多人。海军政治学院发挥宣传优势，协助三个街道成立了3所“业余党校”，并结合干部群众思想实际，开办了“改革开放系列讲座”，培训理论骨干6000多人次。在部队的帮助下，全市的军民共建点已达930个，其中70％被省、市、县评为文明单位。
