Li Peng Meets Representatives of an International Symposium and Says
China's Implementation of the Patent System is a Product of Reform and Opening Up,
Beneficial for Promoting Technological Progress and Overall Economic Development

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 1 (Reporter: Yang Guojun) Premier Li Peng met this evening at the Great Hall of the People with the Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization, Boesch, and representatives from 44 countries and regions attending the "International Symposium on Patent System in the 21st Century."

	Li Peng first, on behalf of the Chinese government, extended a warm welcome to more than 100 distinguished guests from five continents. He said that it is very gratifying to have so many foreign friends participating in this conference to engage in economic and technological cooperation and exchange.

	Li Peng said, China's implementation of the patent system is not long, but there have been many patents applied in production, thus promoting technological progress and the overall development of the economy. It can be said that China's implementation of the patent system is also a product of reform and opening up.

	It is understood that in the past five years, the State Patent Office has received nearly 120,000 patent applications and approved more than 30,000 patents, of which one-fourth are foreign patent applications.

	Li Peng, while introducing China's political and economic situation to the guests, said that China's political situation is stable, and the social order in Beijing has returned to normal; the economic rectification and adjustment that began last year has also shown initial results. He said that starting from today, some areas in Beijing have been patrolled by the Armed Police instead of the military, and this change in the manner of martial law is also a sign of stability.

	Li Peng emphasized that China's policy of reform and opening up will not change, and China can learn from foreign countries in economics, technology, management, including patent technology, and other aspects. He hopes that Chinese and foreign friends will further cooperate in these areas.

	Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Yan Jici, Ni Zhifu, and State Councilor Song Jian attended the meeting.

	After the meeting, the State Science and Technology Commission and the State Patent Office hosted a banquet to entertain the foreign friends attending the symposium.

    李鹏会见一国际讨论会代表时说
    中国实行专利制度是改革开放产物
    有利于促进科技进步和整个经济发展
    新华社北京11月1日电　（记者杨国钧）国务院总理李鹏今天晚上在人民大会堂会见了世界知识产权组织总干事鲍格胥以及出席“21世纪国际专利制度世界讨论会”的来自44个国家和地区的代表。
    李鹏首先代表中国政府向来自五大洲的100多位贵宾表示热烈欢迎。他说，有如此多的外国朋友参加这一会议，进行经济技术合作和交流，是非常值得高兴的。
    李鹏说，中国实行专利制度时间不长，但已有不少专利应用于生产，从而促进了科技进步和整个经济的发展。可以说，中国实行专利制度也是改革、开放的产物。
    据了解，近5年来，国家专利局已受理专利申请近12万件，批准专利3万多件，其中1／4是国外申请的专利。
    李鹏在向客人们介绍中国的政治、经济形势时说，中国的政局是稳定的，北京的社会秩序已恢复正常；从去年开始的在经济上的治理整顿也已初见成效。他说，从今天开始，北京部分地区已由武警代替部队执勤，这种戒严方式上的改变，也是秩序稳定的标志。
    李鹏强调，中国的改革开放政策不会变，中国在经济、技术、管理，包括专利技术等方面，都可以向外国学习。他希望中外朋友在这些方面进一步合作。
    全国人大常委会副委员长严济慈、倪志福和国务委员宋健会见时在座。
    会见后，国家科委和国家专利局设宴款待了出席讨论会的各国朋友。
