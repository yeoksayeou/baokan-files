Hong Kong prominent figure, Li Ka-shing, chairman of the Long River Real Estate Group, said in an interview with Hong Kong reporters on November 20 that he is absolutely confident that China's economy will not collapse, regardless of any economic sanctions or other measures imposed by foreign countries.

When discussing the relationship between Hong Kong and mainland China, Li Ka-shing said, "Hong Kong's stability and prosperity are closely related to China's stability and prosperity. If China is unstable, Hong Kong's stability will be limited. If China's economy is poor, Hong Kong's prosperity will also be very limited." He said, "From what I have observed, the Chinese leadership hopes for Hong Kong's well-being. The relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland should not deteriorate." Li Ka-shing also used the example of Hong Kong's trade and economic cooperation with Guangdong to illustrate, "China serves as the 'logistical base' for Hong Kong manufacturers. Without the mainland's vast labor force, inexpensive factories, and low cost of living as support, Hong Kong manufacturers would not be able to produce competitive products to compete internationally. Therefore, cooperation with the mainland is important for Hong Kong, and both sides benefit from it."

Li Ka-shing also expressed his confidence in Hong Kong's future, stating that Long River Real Estate Group's investments in Hong Kong will continue to increase and will not decrease.

　　香港知名人士李嘉诚指出
　　香港内地合作互相得益
    新华社香港11月22日电　香港知名人士、长江实业集团主席李嘉诚20日接受香港记者采访谈到中国的经济前景时表示，无论外国实施经济制裁或其它措施，中国经济一定不会崩溃，他对此绝对有信心。
    在谈到香港与中国内地的关系时，李嘉诚说，香港安定与繁荣，跟中国的安定与繁荣息息相关。如果中国不安定，香港安定的程度也有限，如果中国经济不佳，香港好也极有限。他说：“就我所接触到的中国领导阶层人物，都是希望香港好的。香港与内地不应该关系恶化。”李嘉诚还举香港与广东的经贸合作为例说明，“中国为本港厂家的‘后勤基地’，如果没有内地庞大的劳动力、便宜厂房及低生活指数作后盾，香港厂商没法子生产具有竞争力的货品去与国际竞争。所以，与内地合作对香港是重要的，两者之间是互相得益。”
    李嘉诚还表示对香港前景充满信心，长江实业集团未来在香港的投资仍会继续增加，不会减少。
