A television series titled "Four Dimensions and Nine Provinces—An In-Depth Discussion on the Four Cardinal Principles" recently began filming in Beijing. This series aims to elucidate the Four Cardinal Principles.

The television series employs an artistic form that is popular among the masses, using irrefutable visual materials to trace the history of Marxist theory, the international communist movement, and the Chinese revolution. It argues the significant importance of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and the two fundamental points of reform and opening up in China's socialist construction. The series provides a multi-layered analysis of the Four Cardinal Principles, explaining them from both theoretical and practical perspectives. It also explores how to use television art to present major political theories effectively.

The series is produced by the Propaganda Department of the Shenzhen Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, with the "China's Best" production team organizing theorists and filmmakers to collaborate on its creation. During the writing process, the series received enthusiastic support from the Research Office of the Central Propaganda Department and the Central Compilation and Translation Bureau, among other relevant departments. It is expected to be completed before the Spring Festival of 1990.
