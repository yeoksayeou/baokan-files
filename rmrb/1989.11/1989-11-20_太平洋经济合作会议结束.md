The seventh session of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference, which concluded on the 15th in Auckland, New Zealand, predicted that the regional economy will continue to grow significantly in the coming two years but at a slower pace than last year. The conference's report stated that the slowing of economic growth does not indicate a weakening of the overall regional economic strength. Some countries and regions are decelerating their growth to address issues arising from rapid development. At China's initiative, the four-day conference also announced the establishment of a special working group on science and technology aimed at enhancing regional scientific and technological exchanges.

    太平洋经济合作会议结束
    十五日在新西兰的奥克兰结束的太平洋经济合作会议第七次会议预测今、明两年本地区经济依然会有较大增长，但会低于去年。会议的预测报告说，经济发展速度放慢并不意味着整个地区经济力量的削弱，一些国家和地区放慢速度是为了解决发展过快所带来的问题。在中国的倡议下，这次为期四天的会议还宣布成立了旨在加强地区性科技交流的科技特别工作组。
