Black Dragon River's trade with the Soviet Union has made new breakthroughs this year. The Xinhua News Agency reported from Harbin on November 8 that the total export value of Black Dragon River Province's border trade with the Soviet Union from January to October this year reached 230 million Swiss francs, which is 10% more than the total for last year.

Relevant officials from Black Dragon River Province believe that this year's border trade with the Soviet Union has achieved progress in three areas: First, the two sides' local governments have begun to frequently interact, which is beneficial for the long-term and stable development of border trade. Second, it has broken through the narrow scope of barter trade in the past, and economic and technological cooperation and labor exports have increased dramatically. Third, it has broken through the limitation of barter trade to only consumer goods, and a large number of electromechanical products have entered the Soviet Union.

    黑龙江对苏边贸今年又有新突破
    新华社哈尔滨11月8日电  （记者刘广军）黑龙江省今年1到10月对苏边境贸易出口总额达2.3亿瑞士法郎，比去年全年还多10％。
    黑龙江省有关部门负责人认为，今年黑龙江省对苏边境贸易取得了3个方面的进展：一是双方地方政府开始频繁接触，有利于边贸朝着长期稳定的方向发展。二是突破了以往易货贸易的狭窄领域，经济技术合作和劳务出口剧增。三是突破了易货只限于消费品的局面，大批机电产品进入苏联。
