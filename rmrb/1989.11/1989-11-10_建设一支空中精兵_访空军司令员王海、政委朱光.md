On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Air Force, General Wang Hai, Commander of the Air Force, and Political Commissar Zhu Guang, both of the rank of Major General, told reporters: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force, after 40 years of construction and development, has already possessed the capability to complete missions of air strikes, air support, air transport, aerial reconnaissance, and national air defense. It is playing an increasingly significant role in supporting and assisting land and naval military operations."

The two Air Force leaders, in introducing the growth process of the Air Force, said that the Air Force is a component of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, established on November 11, 1949. Although the Air Force in its early days had few troops and was weak, it bravely undertook the task of air defense operations. Soon after, it formed the Chinese People's Volunteer Air Force and participated in the famous Korean War, gaining experience and development in the midst of the war. In May 1957, the Air Force merged with the Anti-Aircraft Force, establishing a unified air defense system. Since then, the Air Force has developed into a composite force consisting of aviation troops, surface-to-air missile troops, anti-aircraft artillery troops, radar troops, airborne troops, and other specialized troops. Over the past 40 years, it has shot down and damaged more than 3,800 enemy aircraft, successfully completing the glorious task of defending the country's airspace and socialist construction.

Wang Hai said that the aircraft used by the Air Force in its early days, except for a small number captured from the Nationalist Air Force, were mainly purchased from the Soviet Union. Later, with the establishment and development of China's aviation industry, the Air Force's equipment quickly shifted from repair to production, from imitation to independent research and development. By the mid-1970s, the Air Force's aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, and other weapons and equipment had basically achieved nationalization. Currently, the People's Air Force has successively equipped itself with a large number of domestically designed and manufactured fighter jets, attack aircraft, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, and special aircraft. The performance of these aircraft has significantly improved, and the corresponding airborne equipment and weapons, including air-to-air missiles, airborne radars, fire control systems, communication and navigation equipment, and flight control systems, have also seen significant improvements.

Wang Hai, the Commander, said that since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the Air Force's surface-to-air missile equipment has seen some improvements. The combat effectiveness of the Air Force has also been continuously enhanced. The number of "all-weather" pilots has nearly doubled compared to 11 years ago. Most of the flight personnel have reached the level of various grades of pilots, with a considerable number reaching the level of first-class and special-grade pilots. To strengthen international exchanges, the Chinese Air Force has trained a group of young pilots who are proficient in English and can apply it. All division commanders, brigade commanders, and regiment commanders of the aviation troops can fly, and all brigade commanders can lead the team into the air for combat. Regiment commanders can basically handle combat command and teaching training under three or more weather conditions. By deepening training reforms and resolutely implementing the principle of placing education and training in a strategic position, the Central Military Commission's training policy has been implemented in the troops, resulting in a significant increase in the number of aviation troops' first-class regiments, and a marked improvement in pilots' shooting and bombing skills. The technical training of ground troops has also reached a new level. The airborne troops have reached the level of being able to move at any time, land anywhere, and fight immediately upon landing. Various troops have actively developed training simulators, progressing from mechanical simulation to laser and electronic simulation, from technical simulation to tactical simulation, and from simulators used by combat personnel to simulators used by tactical and operational commanders. Currently, the number of aircraft in the Air Force ranks third in the world. To reduce flight accidents, comprehensive measures such as "steady progress" and "fly and rectify" have been implemented from the headquarters to the troops. Over the past decade, the flight safety of the Chinese Air Force has maintained an advanced world level.

Political Commissar Zhu Guang introduced that the Air Force has always taken building a revolutionary, modern, and regularized army as its goal. Aiming at the situation where flight personnel are the main combat force, it has formulated the eight qualities that flight personnel must possess: "lofty ideals, noble morals, broad-mindedness, rich knowledge, solid skills, strict discipline, tenacious spirit, and robust physique," and has taken this as the goal for strengthening the construction of the Air Force's flight personnel. Currently, all Air Force flight personnel have reached the level of college education or above.

Political Commissar Zhu Guang said that to ensure that the troops always maintain a firm and correct political direction, the Air Force's party committees at all levels have strengthened party building and grassroots building, strengthened ideological and political work, and firmly upheld the Four Cardinal Principles, opposing bourgeois liberalization. They have ensured the party's absolute leadership over the Air Force in politics, ideology, and organization. Under the conditions of reform and opening up and the development of socialist commodity economy, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers have withstood the test. Especially in the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the Air Force's party committees and the broad masses of cadres and soldiers have stood firm, with clear banners, and maintained high consistency with the Party Central Committee in their thoughts, politics, and actions. They have maintained the high stability and unity of the troops, withstood the severe test of political storms, and successfully completed the tasks assigned by the Military Commission and the General Headquarters. They have received commendations from the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and praise from the Military Commission and the General Headquarters, adding a glorious page to the history of the Air Force.

Commander Wang Hai and Political Commissar Zhu Guang both expressed that the People's Air Force must adhere to the principle of "the party commands everything," resolutely placing itself under the absolute leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, and acting in accordance with the commands of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission. They will strive to build the Air Force into an iron wall in the sky that is loyal to the party, loyal to the people, and loyal to the motherland.

    建设一支空中精兵
    ——访空军司令员王海、政委朱光
    蔡善武
    空军成立40周年前夕，空军司令员王海上将、政治委员朱光中将告诉记者：“中国人民解放军空军经过40年的建设和发展，已具备完成空中突击、空中支援、空中运输、航空侦察和国土防空等任务的能力，在配合和支援陆上、海上军事行动中发挥着愈来愈大的作用。”
    两位空军领导人在介绍了空军成长过程时说，空军是中国人民解放军的一个组成部分，成立于1949年11月11日。初创时期的空军虽然部队不多，力量弱小，却勇敢地担负起防空作战任务，不久又组成中国人民志愿军空军，参加了举世闻名的抗美援朝战争，在战火中得到了锻炼和发展。1957年5月，空军与防空军合并，建立了空防合一的体制。从此，空军发展成为包括航空兵、地空导弹兵、高射炮兵、雷达兵、空降兵和其他专业兵种所组成的合成军种。四十年来，先后击落击伤敌机3800多架，出色地完成了保卫祖国领空和社会主义建设的光荣任务。
    王海说，空军创建初期所使用的飞机，除少部分缴获国民党空军的外，主要是从苏联购买的。后来随着我国航空工业的建立与发展，空军装备很快由修理转为制造，由仿制转为自行研制。到70年代中期，空军的飞机、地空导弹等武器装备基本上实现了国产化。目前，人民空军已陆续装备一大批我国自行设计制造的歼击机、强击机、轰炸机、侦察机和特种飞机。这些飞机的性能有较大提高，与其配套的机载设备和武器，包括空对空导弹、机载雷达、火控系统、通信导航设备、飞行控制系统等，均有较大改进。
    王海司令员说，党的十一届三中全会以来，空军的地对空导弹装备有了一定的改进。空军的战斗力也在不断提高。“全天候”飞行员数量比11年前增加了近一倍。大部分飞行人员已达到各类等级飞行员水平，其中有相当一部分已达到特级和一级飞行员水平。为了加强国际交流，中国空军已培养一批熟练掌握和应用英文的年轻飞行员；航空兵部队的所有的军长、师长、团长都能飞行，所有的飞行师长全都能带队升空作战，飞行团团长基本都能胜任三种气象条件以上的作战指挥和教学训练任务；深化训练改革，坚决贯彻把教育训练摆在战略地位上，保证了中央军委的训练方针在部队贯彻落实，使标志空军战斗力水平的航空兵部队甲类团成倍增加，飞行员射击、轰炸技术明显提高。地面部队的技术训练也达到新的水平，空降兵部队达到了随时能走、到处能降、降即能打的作战水平；各部队积极发展训练模拟器材，已由机电模拟发展到激光、电子模拟；由技术模拟发展到战术模拟；由供战斗员使用的模拟器发展到战术战役指挥员使用的模拟器。目前空军飞机数量居世界第三位。为了减少飞行事故，从机关到部队采取了“稳步前进”、“飞飞整整”等八项综合治理措施。10多年来，中国空军飞行安全一直保持世界先进水平。
    朱光政委介绍说，空军始终把建设一支革命化、现代化、正规化的军队作为奋斗目标。针对飞行人员是部队主要战斗力的情况，制定了飞行人员必须具备的“崇高的理想，高尚的道德，宽广的胸怀，丰富的知识，过硬的本领，严格的纪律，顽强的作风，强健的体魄”八项素质，并作为加强空军飞行员队伍建设的目标。现在，空军飞行人员全部达到大专以上文化水平。
    朱光政委说，为了使部队指战员始终保持坚定正确的政治方向，空军各级党委切实加强了党的建设和基层建设，加强思想政治工作，旗帜鲜明地坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化，从政治上、思想上、组织上保证党对空军的绝对领导。在改革开放和发展社会主义商品经济的条件下，广大指战员经受住了考验。特别是在制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，空军各级党委和广大指战员，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，在思想上、政治上、行动上同党中央保持了高度一致，保持了部队的高度稳定和集中统一，经受住了政治风浪的严峻考验，出色地完成了军委、总部赋予的任务，受到党中央、国务院的嘉奖，受到军委、总部首长的赞扬，在空军的历史上又写下了光辉的一页。
    王海司令员、朱光政委一致表示，人民空军一定要坚持“党指挥一切”的原则，坚决置于党中央、中央军委绝对领导之下，一切行动听党中央、中央军委的指挥，努力把空军建设成为一支忠于党、忠于人民、忠于祖国的空中钢铁长城。
