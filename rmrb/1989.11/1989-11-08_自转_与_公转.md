The proverb "Many hands make light work" illustrates a fundamental truth: the power of an individual is small, but the power of a collective is great.

In recent years, the liberalization of bourgeois ideology has spread widely in the field of ethics. Some people criticize the promotion of collectivism as "harmful," claiming that collectivism "lacks precision and scientificity" and that promoting it will make people lose their freedom of thought. Others advocate that "selfishness is human nature," that it is "naturally reasonable," and that criticism of private ownership is a reaction against human nature. Still, others promote "individual-centered" individualism, claiming that "individualism is the essence of a commodity economy, and now that we are developing a commodity economy, we must also develop individualism," and so on.

Is it really possible to achieve "self-realization" and "value" by constantly advocating for "human selfishness," "individual-centeredness," "individualism," and "self-value"?

Practice tells us that in modern society, anyone can only survive and develop within the larger collective of society. The idea of seeking development in isolation from the group is as futile as trying to lift oneself off the ground by pulling one's own hair—it is sheer nonsense. It is said that the Buddha Sakyamuni once asked his disciples, "How can a drop of water avoid drying up?" The disciples could not answer. Sakyamuni said, "Put it into the sea." A drop of water, when merged into the sea, will never dry up. Once separated from the sea, it will immediately dry up and disappear without a trace. People are the same. Lu Xun once criticized a type of person who imagined that the world consisted of only two people—one being himself and the other a lady, holding a cake and supporting each other to the door to admire the autumn chrysanthemums. Little did they know: a person separated from the collective cannot survive. Everyone needs to eat, wear clothes, live, and use things, and none of these conditions for survival can be achieved without the help of others. According to historical records, during the late Shang Dynasty, the two sons of the Duke of Boji, Bo Yi and Shu Qi, opposed King Wu's campaign against Zhou. After King Wu overthrew the Shang Dynasty and established the Zhou Dynasty, the brothers, in their anger, refused to "eat Zhou grain" and fled into the deep mountains, severing all ties with society. As a result, they both starved to death on Mount Shouyang. Clearly, a person separated from the collective and society cannot even survive, let alone talk about realizing "self-value."

The British writer Grove compared the relationship between the individual and the collective to the Earth's "self-rotation" and "revolution around the sun." This analogy is quite apt. "Self-rotation" may be free, but it must follow the orbit of "revolution around the sun"; individuals must exist and develop within the orbit of social life. Otherwise, they will become a lone flame, quickly extinguished.

### “自转”与“公转”

    “自转”与“公转”
    徐全利
    “众人拾柴火焰高”。这条谚语，说明了一个道理：个人的力量是渺小的，集体的力量是伟大的。
    近几年，资产阶级自由化思潮在伦理学领域大为泛滥：有的人指责宣传集体主义“有害”，说集体主义“缺乏准确性与科学性”，宣传它会使人失去思考自由；有的人鼓吹“自私是人的本性”，“具有天然合理性”，“对私有制的批评，就是对人性的反动”；有的人则宣扬“个人本位”的个人主义，说“个人主义是商品经济的精髓，现在要发展商品经济，就要发展个人主义”，等等。
    这样口口声声宣扬“人性自私”、“个人本位”、“个人主义”、“自我价值”，难道真的“自我实现”了什么“价值”吗？
    实践告诉我们，在现代社会里，任何一个人都只能在社会这个大集体里生存和发展。一切想孤立于人群之外而谋求发展的想法，都无异于拔着自己的头发离开地面，实乃痴人说梦。相传，佛祖释迦牟尼曾问他弟子：“一滴水怎样才能不干涸？”弟子们回答不出。释迦牟尼说：“把它放到大海去。”一滴水汇入大海才永不涸竭，一旦脱离了大海，则会立即干涸，消失得无影无踪。人也如此。鲁迅曾抨击过一种人，幻想世上只有两个人——一个是他，一个是小姐，拿着饼儿，搀扶着到门口看秋海棠。殊不知：一个人离开了集体，无法生存。人人都要吃、穿、住、用，而这些生存条件中，哪样能离开别人的帮助？据史书记载：商末孤竹君的两个儿子伯夷和叔齐，反对武王伐纣。武王灭商建立周朝后，兄弟俩竟愤而“不食周粟”，逃进深山老林，和社会一刀两断，结果都活活饿死在首阳山上。可见，一个人离开了集体、社会，连生存都不可能，何以能谈得上实现“自我价值”？
    英国文学家葛罗夫把个人和集体的关系比作地球的“自转”和“公转”。这个比喻颇贴切。“自转”虽自由，但须沿着“公转”的轨道运行；个人要存在，要发展，必须纳入社会生活的轨道。否则，就会成为独木之火，很快就会熄灭。
