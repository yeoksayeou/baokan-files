Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, November 7th.

As night falls, nearly a hundred nightclubs of various sizes in Shenzhen come alive with activity and bustle. It is only after two in the morning that this most open city in China gradually quiets down.

Among the rich and colorful nightlife entertainment options in Shenzhen, listening to music is the most popular. According to a cultural bureau official, Shenzhen's nightclubs hosted over 3 million visitors last year.

Shenzhen's grand and elegant nightclubs, with ticket prices ranging from a hundred yuan to several tens of yuan, maintain high occupancy rates, generally around 80%.

Employees from various large and small companies are also frequent visitors to these nightclubs. They gather here for meals, meet friends, celebrate birthdays, enjoy some drinks, and dance away their daily fatigue.

For the hundreds of thousands of young workers in Shenzhen, frequenting these luxurious nightclubs is an unaffordable luxury. However, they have their own places to enjoy music: the 30-plus free "Everyone's Joy" performances around the city.

The most famous of these is the "Everyone's Joy" self-recommendation performance hosted by the Shenzhen Youth and Children's Activity Center.

This self-recommended, self-performed, and self-entertaining mass entertainment activity caters to the strong desire of today's youth to participate and provides them with a channel to release their emotions after work. It is very popular among Shenzhen's "working youth."

    深圳别样夜生活  市民流连歌舞厅
    据新华社深圳11月7日电  （记者何广怀、田炳信）每当夜幕降临，深圳近百个大小歌舞厅就活跃热闹起来。直到凌晨两点后，这个中国最开放的城市才会渐渐寂静下来。
    在深圳丰富多彩的夜生活娱乐中，听歌是最受人欢迎的一种。据市文化局的同志介绍，深圳的歌舞厅去年接待观众达300多万人次。
    深圳气派豪华、格调高雅的歌舞厅，时下每张门票高的达百元，低的也要几十元，但上座率甚佳，一般有80％左右。
    在各类大小公司中任职的职员们，也是歌舞厅的常客之一。他们在这里聚餐、会朋友、过生日，喝点饮料跳跳舞，一天劳累随之消散。
    对于深圳几十万青年工人来说，在那些豪华歌厅消磨时间，偶而为之可以，常来常往无疑是难以承受的昂贵消费。不过，他们有自己的听歌去处。那就是市内30多处免费观看的“大家乐”晚会。
    最有名气的要推深圳市青少年活动中心主办的“大家乐”自荐表演晚会了。
    这种自荐、自演、自娱的群众娱乐活动，满足了现在年轻人强烈的参与精神，为他们提供了一个工余宣泄感情的渠道，很受深圳“打工仔”的欢迎。
