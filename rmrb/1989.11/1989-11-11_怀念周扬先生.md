We have lost our most beloved Comrade Zhou Yang.

This news reached me on the morning of August 1st as I was reading the newspaper. I was deeply grieved. As soon as I arrived at our office, I immediately called President Inoue Yasushi, who was on a lecture tour in the Kansai region. President Inoue Yasushi told me he had also seen the news in the paper. His voice was low and trembling as he said, “The sad day has finally come…”

That evening, all the staff of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Council held a memorial service in our modest office. Executive Director Shirakawa Gohei briefly recounted Comrade Zhou Yang's great life, and then we all bowed in silence towards Beijing. That night, we wept and remembered Comrade Zhou Yang until late into the night.

As stated in the condolence telegram sent by President Inoue Yasushi, Representative Director Senji, Toshiyuki Tohma, Executive Director Shirakawa Gohei, and myself: “Comrade Zhou Yang has, since his youth, loved truth and made tremendous contributions to the liberation of China and the establishment of socialist literature. As a leader in the Chinese literary world, he played a significant role in promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and cultural exchange.”

“We have lost Comrade Zhou Yang, an irreplaceable loss. However, his achievements will forever be recorded in the history of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and deeply etched in our hearts.”

I first met Comrade Zhou Yang in 1963 when I served as the secretary of the Japanese Writers Delegation led by Mr. Kinoshita Junji to visit China. Since 1978, I have had the honor of meeting Comrade Zhou Yang several times. Each time, his words left a deep impression on me.

In 1979, when Comrade Zhou Yang led the Chinese Writers Delegation to visit Japan, he not only visited the ailing President Nakajima Kenzo but also came to the office to see all of us. He sat at Mr. Shirakawa Gohei's desk and asked, “Is this Mr. Shirakawa Gohei's desk?” Then he praised, “The office staff working in such a simple room, this style is so good!”

Comrade Zhou Yang not only formed a sincere friendship with the former President Nakajima Kenzo (deceased), current President Inoue Yasushi, and Executive Director Shirakawa Gohei, but he was also so kind and encouraging to all the staff of the office. We, the office staff, trusted and respected him like a father. He was so approachable!

In the spring of 1984, Comrade Zhou Yang, despite his illness, visited Japan for the second time. I still vividly remember the scene of him and his wife, Madame Su Lingyang, meeting with Japanese friends. His warm smile often appears in my mind. I clearly remember the scene of him waving goodbye to us at Narita Airport as he boarded the plane to return home… Little did I know that this would be my last meeting with Comrade Zhou Yang. Seeing the report in the People's Daily on September 6th about Comrade Zhou Yang's funeral, I especially thought of Madame Su Lingyang, who was seriously ill, bidding farewell to Comrade Zhou Yang, and I couldn't help but burst into tears.

I believe that the best way to honor Comrade Zhou Yang is to dedicate ourselves to the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship and cultural exchange. Comrade Zhou Yang will forever live in our hearts.

Comrade Zhou Yang visited Japan twice, both times in the spring. Unfortunately, he did not get to see the beautiful autumn foliage of Japan. I pray for Comrade Zhou Yang's peace in the afterlife.

### 怀念周扬先生

    怀念周扬先生
    日中文化交流协会事务局局长　佐藤纯子
    我们最敬爱的周扬先生与世长辞了。
    这消息是我在8月1日的早晨读报时看到的。我悲痛极了。我一到我们办公的事务所就立刻给在关西地区讲演旅行的井上靖会长打电话。井上靖会长说他也已经在报上得知了这一消息。井上靖会长声音低沉地颤抖着说：“悲痛的日子终于来临了……”
    当天晚上，我们日中文化交流协会事务局的全体人员在简朴的事务所举行了追悼会。专务理事白土吾夫概要地讲述了周扬先生的伟大生平，然后我们全体人员向北京方向默哀。这天晚上我们怀着悲痛的心情流着眼泪怀念周扬先生一直到深夜。
    正如我会井上靖会长，代表理事千田是也、东山魁夷、田伊政磨、专务理事白土吾夫的唁电中所说：“周扬先生从青年时代起热爱真理，为解放中国和建立社会主义文艺作出巨大贡献。他作为中国文艺界的领导，为促进日中友好和日中文化交流起了很大的作用，”
  “我们失去了周扬先生，这对我们是无可估量的损失。但是周扬先生的业绩将永存于日中文化交流的历史，深深铭刻于我们心中。”
    我认识周扬先生是在1963年，那年我作为木下顺二先生为团长的日本作家代表团的秘书访问了中国。从1978年以来，我几次拜见了周扬先生。每次见面，他的谈话都给我留下了深刻的印象。
    1979年周扬先生率中国作家代表团访问日本时，他不但看望了在病中的中岛健藏会长，他还到事务所看望了我们全体人员。他坐在白土吾夫先生的桌前问：“这是白土吾夫先生的桌子吧？”接着称赞说：“事务所的全体人员在这样一间简朴的屋子里办公，这作风是多么的好啊！”
    周扬先生不但与前会长中岛健藏（已故）和现任会长井上靖、专务理事白土吾夫等领导人结下了真诚的友谊，而且对事务局的全体工作人员也是那么慈祥和蔼，鼓励支持我们的工作。我们事务局的工作人员对周扬先生也像对父亲一样的信赖和尊敬。他是多么平易近人啊！
    1984年春，周扬先生带病第二次访日，他和夫人苏灵扬先生与日本朋友会面的情形，还历历在目，他脸上的亲切的微笑至今还不时浮现在我的脑海里，我清楚地记得访日完毕在成田机场登机回国时，他向我们挥手告别的情景……没想到这竟是我与周扬先生的最后一次见面。看到人民日报9月6号对周扬先生遗体告别的报道，特别想到重病在身的苏灵扬先生与周扬先生诀别的情景，我不禁放声哭了起来。
    我想我们只有竭尽全力为日中友好和日中文化交流工作，这就是对周扬先生的最好纪念。周扬先生永远活在我们心中。
    周扬先生两次访日，都是春天，遗憾的是披满红叶的日本的秋天，他没有见过。我祈祝周扬先生冥间福开。
