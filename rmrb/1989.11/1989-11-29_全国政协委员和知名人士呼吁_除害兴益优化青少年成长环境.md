Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 28th.

More than 200 members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and prominent figures held a discussion today, calling on the whole society to take action to eliminate harmful influences and promote beneficial ones to optimize the environment for youth growth.

The discussion was held at the National CPPCC Hall. Vice Chairpersons of the National CPPCC Wang Renhe, Fang Yi, Kang Keqing, and Sun Xiaocun attended the meeting.

Wang Renhe, in his speech, proposed that eliminating harmful influences and promoting beneficial ones means eliminating spiritual pollution and promoting spiritual civilization. The goal is to cultivate a new generation of socialists with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline, and to build a prosperous, civilized, and democratic socialist modernized strong country. He said that the struggle against "peaceful evolution" and for "anti-peaceful evolution" is a serious, complex, and long-term struggle that concerns the life and death of our party and country. In the face of this struggle, we must not panic and lose confidence, nor can we be complacent and take it lightly. We must strengthen the education of the four cardinal principles, resolutely fight against bourgeois liberalization, and carry out the rectification and deepen the reform. Only then can we avoid major turmoil in China and maintain a stable and united situation.

Wang Renhe said that cultivating a new generation of socialists requires the efforts of the party and government, as well as the whole society and various departments, especially schools, which should prioritize moral education. We should educate young people to establish a communist worldview and outlook on life, to understand that the meaning of life lies in dedication, and that pursuing personal pleasure is shameful. Contributing all one's strength to the cause of communism is the most meaningful and valuable life.

China Association for Science and Technology Vice Chairman Qian Sanqiang, in his speech, proposed that we should continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of patriotism and selfless dedication. He said that in recent years, the bad trends of "everything for money," "earning and spending," and "high consumption" have corrupted some young people. Some people lack correct ideological consciousness and the spirit of hard work and frugality in building the country. We must be highly vigilant about this.

Writer Liu Baiyu, in his speech, raised a serious question: Is literature and art a purifier or a corrosive for young people? He said that optimizing the environment for youth growth is a matter of strategic significance and we must highlight the important role of literature and art.

Our literature and art are socialist literature and art. Liu Baiyu said that the mission of this literature and art is to cultivate a new generation of socialists with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline. We should provide young people with excellent spiritual food and give them nourishment, not poison. To achieve this, we must first have a team of literary and artistic workers who are loyal to socialism.

Liu Baiyu proposed that the state should encourage and reward works that have a sublime, inspiring, and positive spiritual realm; and resist those that are negative, pessimistic, doubtful, confused, inferior, filthy, and vulgar. We should create numerous vivid and vivid character images that can serve as models and guides for young people.

Translator Ye Junjian, in his speech, hoped that young people would have a sense of pride and dignity in our nation and country, and have aspirations. He said that we have excellent traditions that need to be carried forward—of course, we also need to discard some bad things, such as corruption, decadence, speculation, and private dealing. We are now building socialism and must promote the glorious side of our history and move forward, which is also a contribution to humanity.

He proposed that our young people must accelerate the improvement of their cultural and moral cultivation—not abstract morality, but morality developed from our nation's excellent traditions and combined with communist ideals. He hoped that publishing houses and book distribution departments would seriously publish and promote more good books, filling the void left by the yellow and low-brow things that once plagued the book market in China with books that truly improve the knowledge and sentiment of the people.

Secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Youth League Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation Luo Sang, in his speech, called on all sectors of society to care about youth work, to extend warm hands, and to jointly optimize the environment for youth growth. He proposed that we should continue to deepen the campaign to eliminate pornography and harmful influences; we should accelerate the establishment of national laws and regulations to protect minors, using the law to guarantee the legitimate rights of young people; we should increase investment in youth cultural construction.

Luo Sang said that youth league organizations at all levels should pay more attention to the ideological and cultural construction of young people. All members of the league should, in the struggle to eliminate pornography and harmful influences, further enhance their awareness of protecting young people and bravely fight against social evils that seriously harm the physical and mental health of young people. The Communist Youth League will strengthen the investigation and research on the ideological and cultural aspects of young people, timely grasp the dynamics, study countermeasures, and hope that all sectors of society will support this work.

Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League Ye Zhishan, in his speech, suggested that factories should open their doors to nearby primary and secondary schools, organizing students to visit factories as a regular activity and as an important social responsibility.

This discussion was jointly organized by the Women and Youth Committee and the Education and Culture Committee of the National CPPCC.

　　全国政协委员和知名人士呼吁
　　除害兴益优化青少年成长环境
    新华社北京11月28日电　（记者邹爱国、胡晓梦）200多名全国政协委员和知名人士在今天上午的座谈中发出呼吁：全社会行动起来，除害兴益，努力优化青少年成长环境。
    座谈会在全国政协礼堂举行。全国政协副主席王任重、方毅、康克清、孙晓村，出席了座谈会。
    王任重在发言中提出，除害兴益，就是除精神污染之害，兴精神文明之益，目的就是培养有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的社会主义一代新人，建设富裕、文明、民主的社会主义现代化强国。他说，摆在我们面前的“和平演变”与反“和平演变”的斗争，是一场严重、复杂、长期的斗争，是关系到我们党和国家生死存亡的斗争。在斗争面前，我们既不能惊慌失措，丧失信心，又不能麻痹大意，掉以轻心。我们只有加强四项基本原则的教育，坚决同资产阶级自由化思想作斗争，搞好治理整顿、深化改革，我国才不会发生大乱子，才能有安定团结的局面。
    王任重说，培养社会主义的一代新人，要靠党和政府的努力，还要靠全社会、各部门的努力，特别是学校要把德育放在第一位。要教育青少年树立共产主义的世界观和人生观，要让青少年懂得人生的意义在于奉献，追求个人享乐是可耻的。为共产主义事业贡献一切力量，这样的生活最有意义、最有价值。
    中国科协副主席钱三强常委在发言中提出，当前应该继续发扬爱国主义和无私献身的光荣传统。他说，这些年来，“一切向钱看”、“能挣会花”、“高消费”等不良风气，腐蚀了一部分青年。一些人缺乏正确思想意识和艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的精神，对此，我们要百倍警惕。
    作家刘白羽委员在发言中向人们提出了一个严峻的问题：文学艺术到底是青少年的净化剂，还是腐蚀剂？他说，优化青少年成长环境，是具有战略意义的一件大事，必须突出文学艺术的重大作用。
    我们的文学艺术是社会主义文学艺术。刘白羽说，这种文学艺术使命是培养有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的一代新人。我们应当奉献给青少年以优良的精神食粮，要给青少年以营养而绝不能给他们以毒品。要做到这一点，首先要有一支忠于社会主义的文学艺术家队伍。
    刘白羽提出，国家要鼓励奖掖那些崇高的、鼓舞的、积极向上的精神境界的作品；抵制抨击那种消极、悲观、怀疑、迷惘、低劣、污秽、下流的货色。我们应该塑造出无数鲜明、生动的人物形象，能够成为青少年的楷模、向导。
    翻译家叶君健委员在发言中希望青少年对于我们的民族和我们的国家都具有自豪感，有自尊心，有抱负。他说，我们有优良的传统，需要发扬——当然也要扬弃一些不良的东西，如贪污、腐化、官倒、私倒。我们现在是在建设社会主义，更要推动我们历史光荣的一面，向前发展，这也是对人类作出的一种贡献。
    他提出，我们的青少年必须加速提高自己的文化修养和道德修养——不是抽象的道德修养，而是从我们民族优良传统中发展出来的、结合共产主义理想的道德修养。他希望出版部门和图书发行部门认真地多出版和多推销好书，把曾经在我国书刊市场上闹得乌烟瘴气的黄色和低级趣味的东西所留下的空白，用真正提高人民的知识和情操的书刊充实起来。
    共青团中央书记处书记、全国青联副主席洛桑委员在发言中呼吁社会各界都来关心青少年事业，都伸出温暖之手，共同优化青少年成长环境。他提出，应该继续深入开展扫黄除害工作；应该加紧建立全国性的未成年人保护法规，用法律保障青少年的合法权利；应该加强对青少年文化建设的投入。
    洛桑说，各级共青团组织要更加注重青少年思想和文化的建设。全团同志在扫黄除害斗争中，要进一步增强对青少年的保护意识，勇敢地向当前严重危害青少年身心健康的社会公害作斗争。共青团将加强对青少年思想文化方面的调查研究，及时掌握动态研究对策，希望社会各界能对这项工作给予支持。
    民进中央副主席叶至善常委在发言中建议，各个工厂要向附近的中小学开放，把组织学生到工厂参观作为一项经常性的活动来抓，作为一项重要的社会义务来抓。
    这次座谈会是由全国政协妇女青年委员会、教育文化委员会联合召开的。
