The seventh meeting of the foreign ministers of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) concluded today in Islamabad. This meeting was primarily held to prepare for the fifth summit of SAARC heads of state, scheduled for the end of this year. However, the meeting failed to decide on the timing of the summit, and thus the fifth SAARC summit will be postponed.

At the fourth SAARC summit held in December 1988, it was decided that the fifth summit would be held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, before the end of this year, with the exact date to be determined by the foreign ministers' meeting. In July of this year, Sri Lanka boycotted the SAARC foreign ministers' meeting in protest of India's refusal to withdraw its troops from Sri Lanka. After the opening of this foreign ministers' meeting, the Sri Lankan foreign minister stated that although an agreement had been reached with India for the complete withdrawal of Indian troops from Sri Lanka by December 31 of this year, Sri Lanka "cannot consider hosting the fifth summit until the Indian troops have completely withdrawn." Therefore, this foreign ministers' meeting decided to request the fourth SAARC summit chair, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, and the heads of state of the SAARC countries to determine the date of the next summit through consultation.

Foreign ministers from Pakistan, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka participated in the two-day meeting.

    南亚合作联盟举行外长会议
    第五届南盟首脑会议将推迟
    本报伊斯兰堡11月9日电  记者任毓骏报道：在伊斯兰堡举行的南亚区域合作联盟第七次外长会议今天结束。此次会议主要是为预计于今年底召开的第五届南盟国家首脑会议作准备，但会议未能就首脑会议召开的时间作出决定，因而这一届南盟首脑会议将推迟。
    1988年12月举行第四届南盟首脑会议时曾决定，第五届首脑会议于今年年底前在斯里兰卡首都科伦坡举行，具体时间由外长会议决定。今年7月，斯里兰卡为了抗议印度拒绝撤出驻斯印军而抵制了南盟外长会议。这次外长会议开幕后，斯里兰卡外长表示，虽然印斯达成协议，在今年12月31日前印度驻斯军队全部撤离，但斯里兰卡“在印度军队完全撤走之前，不能考虑主办第五届首脑会议”。因而，这次外长会议决定，吁请第四届南盟首脑会议执行主席、巴基斯坦总理贝·布托与南亚各国首脑通过协商确定下届首脑会议日期。
    巴基斯坦、不丹、印度、马尔代夫、尼泊尔、孟加拉国和斯里兰卡的外交部长参加了这次为期两天的会议。
