In the region of Chuzhou, Anhui Province, which was the first in the country to implement the "Responsibility System," efforts have been made to mobilize the enthusiasm of farmers under the household contract system while fully leveraging the advantages of the collective economy. By organically combining these two aspects, the region has promoted the improvement of the responsibility system and the sustained growth of the rural economy. Recently, Song Ping, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, affirmed this approach during his inspection of the region.

Eleven years ago, when the household contract responsibility system was first implemented, the Chuzhou Regional Committee clearly stated: The "Responsibility System" is a responsibility system of separating two rights, changing only the operating method of "eating from the same big pot," not the change of ownership. Therefore, the "Responsibility System" cannot be left to its own devices; it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of rural work and maintain the stability of the grassroots organizations. They established the contract management system, the post responsibility system for cadres, the target management system for cadres' terms, and various service economic cooperation systems to match the household contract system. The "five systems" work together to form a new type of rural management system that combines collective and individual efforts and dual-layer management.

To enhance the strength of the collective economy, the Chuzhou region has vigorously developed township enterprises, development-oriented agriculture, and other economic entities. Currently, there are more than 16,000 township and village-level enterprises in the region, with a total fixed asset value of 555 million yuan, an increase of more than tenfold compared to 1978. Last year, the industrial output value of township and village-level collective enterprises was 1.074 billion yuan, accounting for 65% of the total industrial output value of township enterprises. In addition, townships and villages use the funds remitted by township enterprises and development-oriented agriculture to establish various collective undertakings. In Quanjiao County, Chenqian Township used the 11.45 million yuan remitted from water surface contracts over eight years to build dikes, pave roads, install electricity, pump water, and pay cadre salaries, without levying funds from farmers.

Since 1979, the region has used a combination of collective accumulation, farmers' investment, and labor input to carry out basic construction and improve production conditions. Every year, 400,000 laborers are organized to build water conservancy projects. Over ten years, 30,000 new and repaired projects have been completed, increasing the effective irrigation area to 73% of the cultivated land. The total power of agricultural machinery has increased by 1.27 times compared to 1978.

To solve the problems that farmers urgently need to address but cannot solve individually, various places have established agricultural technology stations, agricultural machinery stations, agricultural economy stations, forestry and fruit stations, water conservancy and fishery stations, and livestock and veterinary stations, as well as township enterprise service companies, totaling 1,032 such service-oriented economic entities across the region. These entities provide guarantees for the promotion of science and technology, fund management, material supply and marketing, as well as the development of development-oriented agriculture and township enterprises.

The organic combination of the advantages of the collective economy and the enthusiasm of household contracts has produced a synergistic effect, driving the region's economy to grow steadily for 11 years. It is expected that this year's total grain production will reach 3.1 billion kilograms, setting a new historical record. Cotton, oil, aquaculture, and pork production have also increased. Over the past 10 years, the region has provided more than 10 billion kilograms of commercial grain to the state. Currently, except for oil, cotton, and tobacco, the region has an average of 1 mu of "economic fields" per household. 74.2% of the mountainous areas and 97.5% of the aquaculture areas have been developed, and 73 specialized production bases for forestry, livestock, aquaculture, and other sectors have been established.

    把“大包干”同集体经济优越性结合起来
　　滁县地区经济持续增长
　　今年可产粮31亿公斤创历史纪录
  　本报讯　在全国率先实行“大包干”责任制的安徽省滁县地区，在调动农民家庭承包积极性同时，充分发挥集体经济优越性，并将二者有机结合，促进了责任制的完善和农村经济的全面持续增长。前不久在这里考察的中共中央政治局常委宋平同志肯定了这一作法。
    11年前，家庭联产承包制一开始实行，滁县地委就明确指出：“大包干”是两权分离的责任制，改变的只是吃“大锅饭”的经营方式，而不是所有制的改变。因此，“大包干”不能大撒手，必须加强农村工作的领导，保持基层组织的稳定。他们建立经济合同制，干部岗位责任制、干部任期目标管理制、各类服务经济合作制与家庭承包制相配套，“五制”并举，构成一种统分结合、双层经营的新型农村经营管理体制。
    为增强集体经济的实力，滁县地区大力发展乡镇企业、开发性农业和其它经济实体。目前，全区乡、村两级企业已有1.6万多个，固定资产原值5.55亿元，比1978年增长10多倍。去年乡、村两级集体工业产值10.74亿元，占乡镇工业总产值的65％。此外，乡镇村队还用乡镇企业和开发性农业的上交款，兴办各种集体事业。全椒县陈浅乡把8年来上交的水面承包款114.5万元用于修圩、铺路、架电、抽水，支付干部报酬，不向农民摊派筹款。
    1979年以来，全区用集体积累、农民集资和劳务投入相结合的办法，进行基本建设，改善生产条件。每年组织40多万劳力兴修水利，10年共新建和维修工程3万多处，使有效灌溉面积达到耕地的73％，农业机械总动力比1978年增长1.27倍。
    为了解决农户在承包经营中急需解决而一家一户又无力解决的问题，各地以乡镇为单位，先后创办了农技站、农机站、农经站、林果站、水利水产站、畜牧兽医站和乡镇企业服务公司等“六站一公司”。现在，这类服务性的经济实体共有1032个，遍布全区，形成网络，为科技推广、资金管理、物资供销以及开发性农业和乡镇企业的发展提供了保障。
    集体经济的优越性和家庭承包的积极性有机结合，产生合力，促使全区经济11年持续增长。预计，今年粮食总产为31亿公斤，创历史最高纪录。棉、油、水产品、生猪也有新的增长。10年来，全地区共向国家提供商品粮100多亿公斤。目前，除油、棉、烟外的“经济田”，全地区已户均1亩。74.2％的山场和97.5％的可养水面得到开发，建成73个林果、畜牧、水产等专业生产基地。
