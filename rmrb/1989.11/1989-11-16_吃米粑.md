It has been a long time since I last tasted the sticky rice cake from my hometown.

As soon as I boarded the train, my heart began to race with excitement, wishing I could close my eyes and be instantly transported home.

My hometown is located in the primitive region of the Dabie Mountains—Liuping. There, the mountains stretch endlessly, rolling on and on, with a stream cutting through, stretching for dozens of miles, known as Changxi Creek. Every summer, girls would go to the creek to wash their hair, their long black locks flowing with the water, a sight of pure elegance.

The sweet water of Changxi Creek makes the sticky rice cakes sweet as well. No sugar or ice is needed; they are naturally sweet and delicious. If you add a few reed leaves while steaming, the cakes will be even more fragrant, refreshing the mind and stimulating the appetite.

I do not know the exact history of the sticky rice cake, but I know it is round and plump, thick in the middle and thin around the edges, resembling the ancient wooden wheels of ox carts. I also know that sticky rice cakes are made from fermented rice flour.

Sticky rice cakes from my hometown are not something you can easily come by. Except for the four major festivals and weddings or funerals, it is rare for anyone to make them on ordinary days.

The first time I ate a sticky rice cake was during my sister's wedding. That day was bustling with activity—escorting the bride, welcoming the in-laws, and friends and relatives all brought sticky rice cakes. Children from nearby villages, who came to watch the excitement, each received a piece, ensuring no one left with an empty mouth. At that time, I was among the children and also got a piece. Holding the sticky rice cake, I ate while jumping with joy, shouting, "Let's see the bride! Let's see the bride!" Little did I know, this incident later got me scolded by my mother. Only then did I realize that on the day my sister got married, my mother had eaten the sticky rice cake with tears in her eyes.

Twenty years have passed in the blink of an eye. In 1975, I brought my young daughter back to my hometown. By then, my mother was already frail and elderly. At that time, I wished more than anything that my mother could make a sticky rice cake for me with her own hands, but the village was so poor that we could barely make ends meet. Forget about sticky rice cakes; even filling our stomachs with porridge was a challenge.

Not long after, my mother passed away, and my wish remained unfulfilled. I brought my wife and children back to the village for the funeral. My aunts made potato pancakes to substitute for the sticky rice cakes and served them to us. As I ate, tears streamed down my face.

Oh, Dabie Mountains, your heart must have been so heavy then!

"Woo—!" The whistle of the train brought me back to the reality of my hometown. As I got off the train and walked along the paths, I heard endless local dialects, saw endless green fields, and countless villages. What a beautiful landscape of western Anhui!

"Uncle Seven is back!" As soon as I reached the village entrance, my third brother's son, Tea, shouted. Immediately, a crowd of nephews rushed out, pulling and tugging me into the house.

Lunch was at my third brother's house, with six dishes and one soup, including braised chicken, drunk pork, and spicy mushrooms. The rice was pure white sticky rice cakes.

"This..." I felt uncomfortable with my third brother's generosity.

"Seventh Brother," my third brother, noticing my thoughts, smiled and said, "Nowadays, sticky rice cakes are not a rare delicacy in the mountains. We eat them every day. Look!" My third brother pointed with his chopsticks towards the door. Wow! Under the tree, a large group of people were sitting together eating, each holding a sticky rice cake. They chatted and laughed, creating a lively atmosphere.

I carefully picked up a piece with my chopsticks and savored the delicious taste of my hometown's life.

    吃米粑
    赵秀杰
    很久没有吃到家乡的米粑了。
    刚上火车，我的心就激动起来，恨不能一闭眼就到家。
    我的家乡位于大别山的原始地带——柳坪。那里山山相连，起伏不断，中有一水泻出，长达数十里，名曰长溪。每至仲夏，姑娘们都到溪边洗发，青丝随流水飘荡，好不潇洒。
    甜甜的长溪水，做出来的米粑总是甜甜的，不用放糖，不用加冰，吃起来却甘甜可口。若能采几片苇叶放在笼里，蒸熟后就更清芬扑鼻，沁人心脾；闻一闻就会让你食欲大增，垂涎三尺的。
    我不知道米粑的历史究竟缘于何种年月，只知道米粑的形状是圆鼓鼓的，中间厚周围薄，活像古老的牛车木轮一般；只知道米粑是用米粉发酵而成的。
    家乡的米粑，不是随便可以吃到的，除了一年四节，婚丧嫁娶外，平时是很少有人家做这种东西的。
    我第一次吃米粑，是在姐姐出嫁的时候。这一天很热闹，接姑娘，迎姨娘，三朋四友，纷纷送来米粑。山前山后，跑来看热闹的孩子们，一人一块，没有空嘴回去的。当时，我混在孩子们中间，也得了一块。我拿着米粑，一边吃，一边高兴得跳起来，并冲着姐姐嚷道：“看新娘了！看新娘了！”谁知，这事后来被母亲知道了，她狠狠地说了我一顿。这时，我才想起姐姐出嫁的那一天，母亲是抹着眼泪吃米粑的。
    一晃20年过去了。1975年我带小女儿回家乡，母亲已经老态龙钟了。那时，多希望母亲能亲手做一次米粑给我吃呀，可是，山村穷得上顿不接下顿，别说米粑，就连菜糊糊也难得填饱肚子。
    不久，母亲就过世了，我的愿望终未实现。我领着妻子儿女回乡奔丧，婶婶们用土豆面做饼代替米粑端给我们吃，我吃着吃着，泪水就流出来了。
    大别山呵，您那时的心情是多么沉重啊！
      “呜——！”一声汽笛，把我载到了故乡的现实中。下车登路，大道小径，听不完的乡音俚语，览不够的禾青谷黄，数不尽的村村寨寨，好一派秀丽的皖西风光。
      “七叔回来啦！”我刚走到村口，三哥家的茶儿却喊起来。接着，“轰”地一下，侄儿们都出来了，拉拉扯扯地把我拥进了屋。
    中餐是在三哥家吃的，六菜一汤，有扣鸡、醉肉、辣子菇等，饭是雪白雪白的米粑。
      “这……”我对三哥的破费感到不安。
      “七弟”，三哥看出了我的心思，笑眯眯地对我说，
  “如今山里，米粑不算什么稀罕物了，我们平时都吃它。你看！”三哥用筷子指了指门外。嗬！树下，一大帮人围坐在一起吃饭，手里都拿着米粑。大家边吃边拉话，你一言我一语的，好不热闹。
    我小心翼翼地用筷子也夹起一块，细细品味家乡日子的鲜美。
