The International Children's Television Program Exhibition, co-hosted by the National Committee for Children and Youth Work Coordination, Central Television, the China Children and Youth Foundation, and the Soong Ching Ling Foundation, will officially begin on November 7th in the evening. Over 80 programs from more than 40 countries and regions in Asia, Europe, America, and Oceania will participate in this exhibition. This is the largest-scale international children's television cultural exchange activity ever held in China.

The exhibited programs include animated films, television dramas, puppet shows, science fiction films, special documentaries, fairy tale plays, and musicals. The content is rich and diverse, catering to audiences from toddlers to middle school students, with a wide range of themes. Notable programs include the Soviet Union's animated film "Little Pig Funtik," the United States' "The Mouse and the Motorcycle," the United Kingdom's "Alice in Wonderland," Cuba's "Pablo," the German Democratic Republic's television drama "I Love Viktor," Australia's "Embrace the Sun," and Yugoslavia's "Rainbow," all of which have high artistic standards. Some of these programs have even won "Outstanding Program" awards at international children's television festivals.

To meet the needs of young viewers, Central Television will broadcast all the programs on its first channel, with key programs scheduled during the prime-time slot following the "News Broadcast." The entire exhibition will last approximately three months. After the exhibition, the organizing committee will select 10 outstanding and commemorative awards from the 80 programs and, for the first time, invite children to serve as judges.
