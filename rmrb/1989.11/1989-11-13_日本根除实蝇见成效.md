The Mediterranean fruit fly larvae harm various fresh fruits, while the melon fly larvae harm many types of melons and vegetables. Controlling these two pests typically involves the use of insecticides, which can kill the pests and protect yields, but cannot completely eradicate them. Japan has adopted advanced pest control methods and achieved remarkable results in eradication and economic benefits.

For the Mediterranean fruit fly, the primary method involves using sex attractants to lure the flies with a small amount of the insecticide dichlorvos, killing the male adult flies in the field to reduce the mating opportunities for female adult flies. Over more than ten years, Japan has systematically eradicated the pest on a per-island basis, spending approximately 5 billion yen. Currently, Japan has successfully eradicated the Mediterranean fruit fly. For the melon fly, the method of releasing sterile males is used. In Okinawa, a modern melon fly breeding and male sterilization factory was established (with an investment of 3.58 billion yen). The factory uses cobalt-60 gamma rays to irradiate large quantities of melon fly pupae bred indoors, rendering the male flies sterile after they hatch. These sterile males are then released using helicopters over the affected areas, with releases sometimes reaching over 100 million flies per week. After mating with wild female melon flies, the females fail to produce fertilized eggs and lose their reproductive capability, thus gradually achieving the goal of "cutting off the lineage." Over the past seven years, Japan has spent 3.7 billion yen on this effort. Currently, the melon fly has been almost completely eradicated, with plans to completely eradicate it by 1991. Although this pest control project requires significant investment, the economic benefits are substantial. Each year, it can prevent approximately 10 billion yen in economic losses caused by pest damage.

    日本根除实蝇见成效
     张遵雄
    桔小实蝇幼虫为害各种鲜果，瓜实蝇幼虫为害多种瓜菜。防治这两种害虫，通常施用杀虫剂，虽可灭虫保产，但对害虫不能根除。日本采用先进的灭虫方法，取得了引人瞩目的根除效果和经济效益。
    对桔小实蝇，主要采用性引诱剂诱虫醚，加少量杀虫剂二溴磷，诱杀田野雄成虫，以减少雌成虫交配机会。经十余年分岛屿逐片扑灭，共花费约50亿日元，目前日本已根除桔小实蝇。对瓜实蝇，则采用雄性不育虫的方法扑灭。在冲绳建立了现代化的瓜实蝇人工繁殖和雄性不育处理工厂（投资35.8亿日元），用钴60伽玛射线辐射处理室内大量繁殖的瓜实蝇蛹，造成羽化后的雄蝇不育，然后用直升机在虫害区上空释放，每周投放多时达1亿余只，经与田野瓜实蝇雌成虫交配后，使雌蝇不产生受精卵，丧失生殖力，从而逐步达到“断子绝孙”的目的。近7年来，日本共耗资37亿日元，目前已基本消灭瓜实蝇，计划到1991年全部消灭。这项防治工程虽投资较大，但经济效益显著，每年可挽回因虫害造成的经济损失约100亿日元。
