	Ode to the Red Rock — In Memory of the Martyrs of Chongqing's November 27th
		Liang Ping

	I. Visiting the Site of General Yang Huicheng's Martyrdom
	You were grief-stricken, "The mainland has slept for too long."
	Who would have thought that this reception room
	Would suddenly make you fall asleep?
	Outside the window, the night is as dark as ink,
	Autumn rain drips on the half-mountain.
	The sorrow of September,
	Your life of war and horses,
	Eight thousand miles of a general's journey,
	Standing upright in the rain of bullets and forests of guns,
	Standing upright as the soldiers' pride.
	The ancient city of Xi'an held your heroic spirit aloft,
	Let China look up for a long time,
	Let the world look up for a long time.
	Chiang Kai-shek, in a fit of rage,
	Accepted you in the White House.
	Since then, the soldiers have not seen you.
	Your deep male voice and the galloping hooves have vanished.
	Afterward, a lion was caged.
	Your military boots stomped on the floor,
	But it was to no avail.
	Twelve years made your memories and dreams
	Only remain in the iron window.
	That day, you went out in high spirits.
	The knife came from behind,
	With no sound,
	But the pines on Songlin Hill are still trembling slightly...

	II. Eulogy for Songlin Hill — In Memory of Three Hundred Heroes
	Songlin Hill drank bullets and fell,
	The sky bled endlessly,
	Blood-redding the calendar of November 27, 1949.
	The sunlight was too strong,
	Many eyes were injured.
	The gunshots on Songlin Hill lasted for a long time.
	The iron windows were still shaking,
	The iron doors were still shaking,
	The iron shackles fell step by step,
	The sorrowful "Internationale" flowed into the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers,
	Embracing an isthmus.
	Dawn was near,
	The evil gun muzzles swept madly,
	The gunpowder was too thick,
	The fog was thick in Chongqing,
	The fog was thick on Songlin Hill.
	Three hundred heroes,
	Three hundred martyrs,
	Three hundred iron wills
	Faced death with laughter,
	The laughter drowned out everything on Songlin Hill,
	Including the howling and wailing.
	Even the fallen anger could not stand up again,
	But it was as majestic as standing.
	Songlin Hill drank bullets and fell,
	The souls lying in the ground listen to the waves on the hill.
	The pines sprout from the earth,
	The pines sprout from the bodies of the martyrs lying on their backs,
	Already a sea of green...

	III. The Iron Window Poetry Society
	To the west of Chongqing, there is a place called Zazhudong.
	The moon is pale,
	In the past, there were sentries and electric fences.
	A group of young people under the iron windows
	Loved to fantasize at the age of being imprisoned.
	They formed a poetry society,
	Singing about themselves not belonging to the cold silence.
	Poetry that cannot be killed by torture and beating,
	Carved on the wall with bamboo splinters,
	Written on paper with fresh blood,
	Whispering and reciting from one iron window to another,
	Saying they want to burn this coffin,
	Saying they want to sit out the bottom of the prison...
	The poets burned themselves,
	Every sentence was a brilliant finale.
	Poetry connected every cell into a battlefield.
	Reading these poems always makes people cry.
	For these poems, the editors of the publishing house
	Published their "Prison Songs."
	"The Prison Songs" became an immortal monument of poetry.
