Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 25th.

A spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation today issued a statement, affirming that the mainland will not change its economic and trade policies towards Taiwan and denying that the mainland has implemented tightening measures on Taiwanese businesses.

The spokesperson said that recently, some Hong Kong and Taiwanese publications have used the mainland's release of a list of companies authorized to handle import trade with Taiwan to speculate that the mainland has adopted tightening measures against Taiwanese businesses. Some publications even claimed that the mainland intends to revoke the rights of mainland Taiwanese-invested enterprises to import raw materials from Taiwan, forcing Taiwanese businesses to withdraw their investments and "hand over their factories." These statements are baseless speculations.

The spokesperson pointed out that to develop exports to Taiwan and balance cross-strait trade, all foreign trade companies can engage in export trade with Taiwan within the scope approved by the state. Due to the Taiwan authorities' continued ban on mainland economic and trade personnel entering Taiwan and direct trade, to protect the interests of all parties in cross-strait trade, the mainland has always stipulated that mainland enterprises and users importing Taiwanese products must go through foreign trade companies approved by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. This in no way affects the import channels of Taiwanese-invested enterprises.

The spokesperson said that this time, the list of central foreign trade and industrial trade companies and provincial-level foreign trade companies currently approved to handle import trade with Taiwan was specially released to provide Taiwanese businesses with a clear path when coming to the mainland to discuss trade, making it more convenient and reducing detours. Due to the late start and small volume of cross-strait trade in some provinces and autonomous regions, no specific companies have been designated to handle import trade with Taiwan and reported to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. Therefore, this list is not complete. According to the "Regulations of the State Council on Encouraging Investment by Taiwan Compatriots," issued in 1988, Taiwanese-invested enterprises in the mainland can independently import raw materials, fuels, components, parts, components, and accessories used for the production of export products, and are exempt from paying customs duties and unified industrial and commercial taxes, and are exempt from import licenses. This regulation is clear. The already established Taiwanese-invested enterprises have had no doubts about this in practice. We hope that Taiwanese businesses will not be misled by rumors and misunderstandings.

The spokesperson emphasized that the practice of foreign trade and industrial trade companies approved by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation handling import trade with Taiwan has been consistent for the past decade and is not a new policy. In the early days of indirect cross-strait trade, we only approved state specialized foreign trade corporations to handle import trade with Taiwan. Later, as reform and opening up progressed and cross-strait relations improved, the companies approved to handle import trade with Taiwan gradually expanded to comprehensive foreign trade companies at the provincial, autonomous region, and municipal levels. Guangdong and Fujian provinces, which have larger volumes of trade with Taiwan, have even more relaxed policies. For example, Guangdong Province has five companies that can handle import trade with Taiwan. In addition, there are dozens of small-scale trade companies in the provinces and municipalities of Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong that can conduct small-scale transactions with Taiwanese fishing boats according to regulations. He said that for many years, import trade with Taiwan has always been conducted through these channels and has not caused inconvenience to Taiwanese businesses. The publication of these company names is not a new restrictive measure but rather a further opening up.

The spokesperson concluded by saying that this incident of distorted reporting once again highlights the need for direct contact between businesspeople and economic and trade management agencies on both sides of the strait. Only through direct contact can situations be communicated in a timely manner, misunderstandings be eliminated, problems be solved, and both sides of the strait benefit from economic and trade relations. We hope that the Taiwan authorities will follow the trend, face reality, and contact the relevant mainland authorities as soon as possible to promote the healthy development of cross-strait economic and trade relations and do something practical and beneficial.

### 经贸部有关负责人否认对台商采取紧缩措施　大陆对台经贸政策没变　望台湾厂商不要听信毫无根据的臆测

　　经贸部有关负责人否认对台商采取紧缩措施
　　大陆对台经贸政策没变
　　望台湾厂商不要听信毫无根据的臆测
    新华社北京11月25日电　对外经贸部有关方面负责人今天发表谈话，表示大陆不会改变对台经贸政策，否认大陆对台商采取了紧缩措施。
    这位负责人说，最近港台一些报刊利用我公布了一些经营对台进口贸易业务的公司名单这件事，评说我对台商采取了紧缩措施。有些报刊甚至说，我们要取消大陆台资企业进口台湾原材料的权利，以迫使台商撤资，“拱手让厂”。这些言论都是毫无根据的臆测。
    他指出，大陆为了发展对台出口，积极平衡两岸贸易，所有外贸公司均可以在国家批准的经营范围内开展对台湾的出口贸易。由于台湾当局仍禁止大陆经贸人士入台和直接贸易，为了维护两岸贸易各方的利益，我们一向规定大陆企业和用户进口台湾产品，必须通过经贸部批准的外贸公司进行。这丝毫不涉及台湾投资企业的进口渠道。
    他说，我们这次特别公布了目前已批准的经营对台进口贸易的中央外贸、工贸公司及各省级外贸公司的名单，是为了使台商来大陆洽谈贸易时有路可循，更加方便，少走弯路。由于少数省、自治区开展对台贸易较晚，数额亦少，故尚未指定专门经营对台进口贸易的公司并向经贸部备案，所以这个名单还不完全。根据1988年发布的《国务院关于鼓励台湾同胞投资的规定》，台湾同胞在大陆设立的企业，均可以自行进口用于生产出口产品的原材料、燃料、散件、零部件、元器件、配套件，并免缴关税、工商统一税，免领进口许可证。这个规定是明确和清楚的。已开办的台胞投资企业在实践中对此也都没有疑义。希望广大台湾厂商，不要听信谣言，产生误会。
    这位负责人强调指出，由经贸部批准的外贸公司和工贸公司经营对台进口贸易，是10年来一贯的做法，并非新的政策。在两岸间接贸易初期，我们只批准国家专业外贸总公司经营对台进口贸易。以后，随着改革和对外开放的进展以及两岸关系的缓和，经营对台进口贸易的公司逐步放宽、扩大到省、自治区和直辖市一级的综合外贸公司。对台贸易量比较大的广东、福建两省比其他省放得更宽，比如广东省就有五家公司可以经营对台进口贸易。此外，苏、沪、浙、闽、粤四省一市还有几十家对台小额贸易公司，可以按规定同台湾渔船进行一些小额交易。他说，多年来，对台进口贸易一直都是经过这些渠道进行的，并未给台商造成不便。公布这些公司的名单非但不是采取了什么新的限制措施，恰恰是进一步开放的表现。
    这位负责人最后说，这次发生的歪曲报道事件，再一次突出地表明，两岸工商人士和经贸主管单位多么需要进行直接的接触。只有直接接触才能及时沟通情况，消除误会，解决问题，惠及两岸经贸并为各方所欢迎。希望台湾当局顺应潮流，面对实际，尽早与大陆有关方面接触，为促进两岸经贸关系健康发展，做一点切实有益的工作。
