The Longjin River divides the ancient village of Xiangyuan into two parts. The eastern half, nestled against the mountains, is home to about thirty to fifty households. The houses are low and old, and behind them are tiered terraced fields. The western half is a bamboo forest, with neat houses and fertile land. Villagers going out or to the city all have to cross the Longjin River, so having a bridge would be very convenient!

The older generation vividly describes how there used to be a bridge, but it was washed away by floods time and time again. The village, township, and county governments have called for the construction of a bridge countless times, but year after year, nothing happened. The villagers still sighed as they looked at the river, relying on a single ferry to shuttle between the two banks. When the mountain floods rose suddenly, the river swelled, and they couldn't cross, they could only stare in frustration and anxiety.

The ferryman was a villager named Wang Yun. The black house by the river was his solitary home. Originally, the ferry did not charge a fee. Whether it was windy or rainy, hot or cold, during festivals or holidays, he guarded the ferry, rowing back and forth across the Longjin River, year after year.

Later, the ferry was leased to him, and he posted a notice: "Fare is five fen per trip." In a few years, following market prices, the fare increased from five fen to one jiao, then to two jiao. Although people didn't mind, they grumbled behind his back, calling him heartless. To cross the river, there was no other way, so they had to take out that bit of money from their pockets, as if giving alms to support this pitiful old man. People talked: "In these years, one jiao, two jiao, who knows how much money he has taken!" This old man saved so much money, but for whom?

Now, the village has built a row of new brick houses. Every family can afford a few hundred yuan, but for some reason, it seems that everyone has forgotten about building the bridge. They just sigh every time they reach the riverbank: "Ah, if only there were a bridge, how convenient it would be!"

However, one day, it seemed like heavenly troops had descended, as a construction team arrived at the riverbank. "Dongfeng" trucks brought in stones, cement, and steel bars... They shouted that they were building a bridge here. The villagers were overjoyed, spreading the news... Soon, a concrete and steel bridge stood proudly between the two banks. On the day it opened to traffic, the villagers were so excited that they bought strings of firecrackers and set them off with a "pop-pop-bang"...

"Ah, Wang Yun's livelihood is cut off!" someone said with a touch of schadenfreude, "That one jiao, two jiao, how much money is that in a year!"

"The bridge was built with Wang Yun's money!" said a township leader who came to cut the ribbon. It turned out that one day, Wang Yun went to the township government and proposed using all his savings to build the bridge. He also requested that this matter not be disclosed for the time being. The bridge was not large, and the cost was not high. At Wang Yun's insistence, the township government agreed, with the township covering the remaining costs. Later, the county also allocated some funds.

Oh, this Wang Yun! Where is he now? People don't see his figure, but in the hearts of his fellow villagers, it seems he is whispering something...

    村前那座桥
    李升宝
    龙津河把古老的湘元村分成两半。东边倚山那半散落着三五十户人家，屋宇低矮古旧，屋后是一层层错落的梯田。村西那半是绿竹林，屋舍俨然，土地肥沃，村人出门或上城都要跨渡龙津河，能有一座桥多方便！
    上一辈人绘声绘色描述：早先有过桥，只是一次一次架起了又被洪水冲垮。村里、乡里、县里不知嚷过多少次要建桥，但年复一年没个影儿。村里人依然望河兴叹，只能借助一只渡船在两岸穿梭摆渡，遇到山洪暴发，河水陡涨，欲渡不能，只能瞪眼，焦急。
    摆渡的是村民王云。临河那间乌黑的屋宇便是他孑然一身的安身立命之地。原先，摆渡不收钱。无论刮风下雨、烈阳严冬、逢年过节，他守着那渡船，在龙津河摇呀摇，年复一年。
    以后，这渡船由他承包，并贴出告示：每次收费五分。不几年，随行就市，水涨船高，由五分至一角，至二角。人们虽然不在乎，暗地里却骂他坏良心。要过渡，别无他途，只能从腰包里掏出那点钱，等于施舍去养这怪可怜的孤老头。人们议论：这些年，一角两角的，谁说得清被他掏去多少钱！这孤老头积攒这么多钱留给谁呀？
    如今，村里盖起一溜溜新砖瓦房，谁家都掏得出三百两百，可不知怎么，似乎谁都忘了要建那座桥，只是走到河岸每每喟然长叹：“咳，能有座桥多好，那有多方便！”
    然而，有一天，好像神兵天降似地，河岸开来了一支施工队伍，“东风”卡车运来了石块、水泥、钢筋……他们嚷嚷在这儿建桥。人们高兴得喜气洋洋，奔走相告……不久，一座钢筋水泥桥便巍然屹立在河两岸。通车那天，村里人激动得买来大串鞭炮“噼噼啪啪”地燃放……
    “咳，如今王云的财路断了！”有人不无幸灾乐祸，“那一角两角，一年到头是多大的财！”
    “建这桥，王云可是掏了钱的！”一位来剪彩的乡领导说。原来，有一天王云找到乡政府，提出将自己的全部积蓄用来建桥，并要求先不要将这事泄漏出去。这桥不算大，费用不算高，在王云的恳求下，乡政府同意了，建桥费不足部分由乡里出。后来，县里也拨了些款。
    哦，这个王云！现在他在哪儿呢？人们看不见他的身影，但他在乡亲们心目中似乎在倾诉着什么……
