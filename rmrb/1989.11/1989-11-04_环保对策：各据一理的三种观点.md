The main environmental issues facing the Earth include acid rain, ozone layer depletion and the greenhouse effect, as well as deforestation and marine and river pollution. In recent years, the international community has focused most on ozone layer depletion and the greenhouse effect, which can be considered the "hot topics" within the broader environmental discussion. Regarding the greenhouse effect and ozone layer depletion, each country, based on its own situation, has put forward different strategies. Generally, these views can be categorized into three types: "suppression," "adaptation," and "moderate."

The "suppression" viewpoint argues that ozone layer depletion and the greenhouse effect will bring significant harm to humanity. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly limit the emission of industrial pollutants such as carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons, even if it means incurring enormous costs. Most Nordic countries adhere to this viewpoint.

The "adaptation" viewpoint contends that oil and coal are the core of current energy sources. Suppressing the consumption of these energy sources is not only extremely difficult but will also significantly hinder economic development. Therefore, it is more important to focus on research and measures to adapt to the Earth's ongoing warming. Many views that appear to be "suppression" are, in essence, "adaptation." This viewpoint is more prevalent in countries with abundant natural resources.

Between the "suppression" and "adaptation" viewpoints lies the so-called "moderate" perspective. The moderate view holds that many factors contributing to the concern over "global warming" have not been scientifically verified. Therefore, on one hand, we should control the emission of pollutants to the extent possible; on the other hand, we should accelerate environmental research and develop policies to adapt to global warming based on observed conditions. Countries like Japan and the United States fall into this category.

    环保对策：各据一理的三种观点
    地球环境问题主要包括：酸雨现象、臭氧层流蚀和温室效应、以及森林毁坏、海河污染等方面。近年来国际上讨论最多的问题是关于臭氧层流蚀和温室效应，可以说是“热点”中的“热点”。对于温室效应，臭氧层流蚀采取何种对策，每个国家根据自身状况，各抒己见，总的说来，这些观点大致可分为“抑制型”、“适应型”和“中间型”三种类型。
    “抑制型”观点认为，臭氧层流蚀及温室效应将给人类带来重大危害，因此现在应该严格限制二氧化碳、氯氟烃等工业废气的排放量，即使付出巨大代价也在所不惜。北欧各国大都执此观点。
    “适应型”的观点认为，石油、煤炭是现在能源的核心，要抑制此类能源的消耗不仅极其困难，而且也会极大地阻碍经济的发展。因此我们更应该致力于研究如何采取措施以适应地球不断的温暖化，这样做付出的代价会小一些。许多观点表面上看来是“抑制型”，若究其本质，仍属“适应型”。在自然资源比较丰富的国家中，执此观点的较多。
    居于“抑制型”与“适应型”二者之间的，即是所谓的“中间派”。中间派认为，人们担心“地球温暖化”的理由，有许多因素并未得到科学上的证实。因此，我们一方面要在可能的范围内尽量控制废气的排放量；另一方面要加快环保科研，根据地球温暖化的情况寻找适应的政策。日美等国均属此派观点。　（孙兵）
