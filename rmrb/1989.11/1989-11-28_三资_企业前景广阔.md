From November 9th to 15th, the newly completed China World Trade Center in Beijing held the China Foreign-Invested Enterprise Achievement Exhibition. Suddenly, this place became the most attractive spot after the closing of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. People braved the early winter chill to come here to visit, shop, and more.

Since the implementation of the open-door policy, “three types of enterprises” have entered Chinese society as a new economic entity, becoming a force in the Four Modernizations and attracting attention both domestically and internationally.

**A Blooming Flower**

The exhibition opened with a series of charts introducing the achievements of China’s foreign-invested enterprises. Over the past decade, China has approved more than 20,000 foreign-invested enterprises, of which more than 8,000 have started production and operation. The agreed foreign investment amounted to $32.1 billion, with $14.1 billion actually used. These enterprises have supplemented part of the shortage of construction funds; brought in advanced technology and management experience, promoting the technological transformation of old enterprises, improving product grades and quality, enhancing export capabilities; expanded employment opportunities, trained construction talents; promoted the development of the tourism industry; and expanded economic and technological cooperation with the outside world, among other achievements. The economic development of special economic zones such as Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Xiamen has attracted attention from both domestic and international communities. The economic development of provinces and municipalities along the coast such as Guangdong, Fujian, Shanghai, and Tianjin has been remarkable, and the establishment of numerous “three types of enterprises” has accelerated the reform and construction of these places.

At the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone booth, many people gathered to watch the color televisions arranged side by side. Each screen displayed the same image, with clear and vibrant colors and lines, drawing admiration from the crowd. Before the establishment of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in 1980, it was just a small town with an industrial output value of only over 70 million yuan. In 1988, the industrial output value miraculously rose to over 8.8 billion yuan. Currently, Shenzhen has signed agreements with businesspeople from 27 countries and regions to utilize foreign capital. By the end of September, the city had registered 2,442 foreign-invested enterprises. The industrial output value of “three types of enterprises” accounts for 61% of the city’s total industrial output value, and the export value of “three types of enterprises” products accounts for 73% of the city’s total export value. Foreign-invested enterprises have become the pillar of Shenzhen’s economy. Famous companies from around the world, such as the United States’ GE Company, DuPont Company, Japan’s Toshiba Group, and the Sanyo Group, have all established wholly-owned or joint-venture enterprises in Shenzhen.

The coastal areas took the lead, and the inland areas followed closely. Now, foreign-invested enterprises have blossomed in all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government. The exhibition includes booths from Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, and other provinces and autonomous regions. Compared to the coastal regions, their scale may not be large, but they are also quite eye-catching. On November 13th, when General Secretary Jiang Zemin visited the exhibition, he was delighted to hear that Tibet had also established joint-venture enterprises.

**Foreign Investment Directions Become More Rational**

More than 850 enterprises participated in this exhibition, representing more than 8,000 operating foreign-invested enterprises nationwide. Their exhibits are distributed in three exhibition halls, mainly including communication equipment, building materials, light textiles, agricultural products, color televisions, refrigerators, automobiles, and other products, with features of advanced technology, export earnings (or filling domestic gaps, replacing imported products).

The Chinese Schindler Elevator Company, which introduced Swiss equipment technology, was established in 1980 and raised China’s elevator manufacturing technology from the 1950s and 1960s level to the 1980s level in one go. Now, the company’s products are widely used in high-end hotels and buildings in China, replacing imports and increasingly exported abroad.

Shanghai’s opening up was later than Guangdong and Fujian, but it has a momentum of catching up in the establishment of production-oriented, technologically advanced “three types of enterprises.” In 1988, the ratio of production-oriented “three types of enterprises” projects to non-production-oriented projects in the city was 200:19. Now, Shanghai has emerged with a large number of high-tech, high-technology “three types of enterprises,” such as Foxboro Company (instrument manufacturing), Yaohua Pilkington Company (float glass manufacturing), and Schering-Plough Company (pharmaceuticals), which have attracted attention from both domestic and international communities.

By categorizing and arranging the exhibited products, enterprises, and projects, and paying attention to age characteristics, one can discover that over the past 10 years, China’s “three types of enterprises” have undergone a tortuous development process from low to high in terms of technology and industrial structure. In the early days of opening up, foreign capital was more invested in the tourism service industry. Later, the state guided foreign capital to invest in production-oriented, technologically advanced, and export-oriented enterprises. Now, combined with the rectification and adjustment, we emphasize the use of foreign capital to develop energy, transportation, communications, raw materials, and other basic industries. In the exhibition, projects such as the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station, the Pingluo Antaibao Open-Pit Coal Mine, and the Sino-foreign cooperation in the development of offshore oil are all placed in the most prominent booths.

**Investment Environment Becomes More Optimized**

In recent years, Fujian Province’s efforts to open up to the outside world have been encouraging. From January to September this year alone, the province approved 665 “three types of enterprises,” with an agreed foreign investment of $700 million, an increase of 90% over the same period last year. Many Taiwanese businesspeople, holding international market orders and export channels, have flocked to invest in and establish enterprises. Why? The deputy director of the Provincial Economic and Trade Commission told us at the booth that in addition to the advantages of cheap labor and high labor quality, the province has seriously focused on the construction of basic facilities such as electricity, transportation, and communications in recent years, greatly improving the investment environment. Especially in terms of electricity, the province is quite abundant. Foreign media have described Fujian as the most ideal place for Taiwanese businesspeople to invest in the mainland.

Some charts and textual explanations show that over the past 10 years, the central and local governments have done a lot of work to improve the investment environment. Currently, China has formulated and promulgated more than 400 foreign-related economic laws and regulations, signed investment protection agreements with 24 countries, and signed double taxation avoidance agreements with 22 countries. These have legally guaranteed the rights of foreign investors. Local governments have generally established institutions to manage foreign investment affairs, and large and medium-sized cities have established consulting and trust investment institutions specifically for foreign investment services. These soft environment constructions are carried out simultaneously with hard environment constructions, making China’s foreign investment environment increasingly optimized.

In the current domestic economic rectification and adjustment, some “three types of enterprises” have encountered difficulties such as insufficient funds, raw materials, or market stagnation to a certain extent. The central and state leaders attach great importance to these problems. According to the organizers of the exhibition, the state’s financial, material, and other departments are currently trying to solve or alleviate the problems faced by “three types of enterprises.”

The 7-day exhibition received 70,000 visitors, including hundreds of foreigners. More than $20 million in export contracts were signed with foreign businesspeople during the exhibition. During the exhibition period, party and state leaders and foreign diplomats stationed in China visited the exhibition. In the exhibition hall, a foreign visitor asked the accompanying person: “China has invested so much time and manpower to hold such an exhibition, what does it mean?” The accompanying person replied to him: “This means that China’s policy on foreign-invested enterprises is unwavering.” The foreigner smiled and nodded.

　　“三资”企业前景广阔
　　本报记者　梅洪如　刘霄
    11月9日到15日，北京新落成的国贸大厦举办了中国外商投资企业成果展览会。骤然，这里成了党的十三届五中全会闭幕以后最吸引人的场所。人们冒着初冬的寒流，来这里参观、购物……
    实行对外开放以来，“三资”企业已作为一个新的经济实体进入我国社会，成为四化建设中的一股力量，引起了国内外注意。
          绽开的一簇鲜花
    展览会开宗明义，进门就用一系列图表介绍了我国举办外商投资企业的丰硕成果。10年来，我国累计批准外商投资企业2万多家，其中已投产运行的8000多家。协议吸收外资321亿美元，实际投入使用141亿美元。这些企业给我国弥补了部分建设资金的不足；带来先进技术和管理经验，促进了老企业的技术改造，提高了产品的档次和质量，增强出口能力；扩大了劳动就业，培养了建设人才；促进了旅游事业的发展；扩大了对外经济技术合作，等等。深圳、珠海、厦门等经济特区经济发展引起海内外瞩目，广东、福建、上海、天津等一批沿海省市经济发展日新月异，其中不可忽视的因素，就是众多的“三资”企业的建立加快了这些地方的改革和建设。
    在深圳特区的展台前，许多人挤在那里观看并排摆放的彩色电视机。每一个屏幕显示出同一幅画面，色彩、线条清晰鲜艳，引起人们啧啧称赞。深圳特区1980年创办之前，不过是个小市镇，工业总产值才7000多万元。1988年工业总产值奇迹般地上升到88亿多元。目前，深圳已同27个国家和地区的客商签订了利用外资协议。到9月底，全市已经登记注册的外商投资企业达2442家，“三资”企业工业总产值占全市工业总产值的61％，“三资”企业产品出口总值为全市出口总值的73％。外商投资企业已成为深圳经济的支柱。世界上著名的美国GE公司、杜邦公司、日本东芝集团、三洋集团等，都在深圳设有独资或合资企业。
    沿海先走一步，内地接踵而上。现在外商投资企业已在全国省、自治区、直辖市普遍开花。展览会里设有新疆、甘肃、宁夏等省和自治区的展台。与沿海地区比较，他们的阵容虽然不大，但也很醒目。11月13日江泽民总书记参观展览时，当听说西藏也办起了合资企业，高兴得频频点头。
        外资投向更加合理
    参加这次展览会的有850多个企业，代表了全国8000多个开业的外商投资企业，它们的展品分布在3个展览厅里，主要是通讯器材、建筑材料、轻纺产品、农副产品、彩电、冰箱、汽车等，具有技术先进、能出口创汇（或者能填补国内空白、替代进口产品）的特点。
      引进瑞士设备技术的中国迅达电梯公司，1980年创办后，把中国的电梯制造技术从五六十年代水平一下提高到80年代中期水平。现在这个公司的产品在国内广泛装备高档宾馆、大厦，替代进口，同时越来越多地向国外出口。
      上海开放比广东、福建晚，但是在举办生产型、技术先进型“三资”企业方面却有着后来居上的势头。1988年该市签订的生产型“三资”企业项目与非生产型项目的比例为200∶19。现在上海市已出现福克斯波罗公司（生产仪表）、耀华皮尔金顿公司（生产浮法玻璃）、施贵宝公司（制药）等一大批高科技、高技术“三资”企业，为国内外所瞩目。
    把参展的产品、企业、项目分类排队，注意年龄特征，便能发现，10年来我国“三资”企业在技术上、产业结构上走过了一段由低到高曲折发展的道路。开放初期，外资在我国投向旅游服务业较多。后来，国家引导外资投向生产型、技术先进型、产品出口型企业。现在结合治理整顿，我们又强调利用外资开发能源、交通、通讯、原材料等基础产业。展览会里，大亚湾核电站、平朔安太堡露天煤矿、中外合作开发海洋石油等项目，都放到了最突出的展台。
    投资环境日趋优化
    福建省近年来对外开放的势头令人鼓舞。仅今年1至9月，全省就批准“三资”企业665家，协议投入外资7亿美元，比去年同期增长90％。许多台商拿着国际市场的订单，带着外销渠道，纷纷找上门来投资办企业。为什么？省经贸委副主任在展台边告诉我们，福建除了劳动力便宜、劳动力素质高等优势外，这几年全省认真抓了电力、交通、通讯等基础建设，大大改善了投资环境。特别是电力，这个省相当充裕。国外传播媒介称，福建是台商往大陆投资的最理想场所。
    一些图表和文字说明，10年来，中央和各地方在改善投资环境上做了大量工作。目前我国已制订和公布了400多个涉外经济法律、法规，同24个国家签订了投资保护协议，同22个国家签订了避免双重征税协定。这些都从法律上保证了国外投资者的权益。各地方政府普遍设立了主管外商投资事务的机构，各大中城市都建立了专为外商投资服务的咨询、信托投资机构等。这些软环境建设与硬环境建设同步进行，使我国的外商投资环境越来越优化。
    在当前国内经济治理整顿中，有的“三资”企业在一定程度上遇到资金、原材料不足或市场疲软等困难。党中央和国务院领导很重视这些问题。据展览会组织者透露，目前国家金融、物资等部门正在设法解决或缓解“三资”企业面临的问题。
    7天展览共接纳7万参观者，其中有数百名外国人。与外商签订2000多万美元的出口合同。展出期间，党和国家主要领导人，外国驻华使节分别参观了展览。在展览厅里，有位外国参观者向陪同发问：中国投入这么多时间、人力办这样的展览，意味着什么？陪同回答他：这意味着中国举办外商投资企业的政策坚定不移。外宾微笑、点头。
