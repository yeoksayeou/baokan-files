Deng Xiaoping urged literary theory workers to use Marxist perspectives to guide literary research. He said: "The humanities must also have theoretical research, using Marxist perspectives to study economics, history, law, philosophy, literature, and so on." (_Deng Xiaoping on Literature and Art_, page 100) He pointed out that some progressive and serious scholars and writers from the West have works and ideas that contain valuable, meaningful, and reasonable cores. We should selectively introduce and absorb these beneficial knowledge and cultures; being closed off and self-sealing is narrow-minded and barbaric. However, he also warned us that for literary works, literary concepts, and literary trends, which are things in the cultural domain, we must use Marxism to analyze, discern, and criticize their ideological content and methods of expression. (_Deng Xiaoping on Literature and Art_, page 84)

Since the reform and opening up, Western literary trends have surged into China, strongly impacting and shaking the literary world, bringing about turmoil and noise, and causing some imbalance and tilt. Those novel, strange, and even absurd literary phenomena are dazzling, making people dizzy, confused, and lost. Among them, there are spiritual achievements that enlighten the mind, as well as decayed and pathological ideological poisons; they have sparked competitive mechanisms, invigorating literary research, but at the same time, they have posed unprecedented challenges to Marxist literary theory; they have to some extent promoted the prosperity of literature, but they have also caused significant ideological confusion. Due to the stimulation of Western literary trends, literary "forbidden zones" have become "hotspots," and literary "cold spots" have become "hotspots." Some influential Western literary theories, such as the literary ideas of Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Sartre, Freud, structuralism, reception aesthetics, and various forms of symbolic linguistics, as well as modernist literary works, have all come in succession. The Chinese literary world has seen a "literary methodology craze," "literary concept craze," "literary psychology craze," "cultural craze," "literary ontology craze," "literary subjectivity craze," "symbolic linguistics craze," and so on. In a short few years, it has hurriedly gone through a century of modern Western literary history, almost reenacting all the literary trends of Europe and America. The introduction of modern Western literary trends has expanded the research horizons of literary theory workers, broadened the perspectives of literary research, and provided thought materials and development opportunities for the development of Marxist literary theory, which must be affirmed. Some scholars have tried to use Marxism, that is, the historical materialism and dialectical materialism worldview and methodology, to carefully analyze Western literary trends, discerning their truth and falsehood, good and bad, benefits and harms, taking their reasonable ideological components, and have made obvious achievements, deepening the understanding of certain aspects of the essence, structure, and function of literature. This correct research attitude takes the development and perfection of Marxist literary theory as its starting point and destination. The motivation and purpose are to construct the contemporary form of Marxist literary theory. Some scholars, however, lack this awareness. They have worked hard but lack purposeful selection. More seriously, a few people, under the influence and infiltration of bourgeois liberalization, regard Western literary trends as the standard, exaggerating and praising the ideological components with some reasonable cores as macro-worldviews and literary views. Their research is not guided by Marxism, nor is it for enriching and developing Marxist literary theory, but rather attempts to use Western literary trends to exclude and replace it. They advocate for the pluralism of literature and literary thought from political and philosophical perspectives, denying and canceling the leading role and guiding function of Marxist literary theory, using our mistakes and oversights to open gaps, and then expanding and pushing these problems to extremes, vigorously praising aestheticism, formalism, "art for art's sake," pursuing "pure aesthetics," "playing with literature," playing tricks with linguistic symbols, and even arbitrarily turning literature into a non-social, non-political, non-moral, non-heroic, non-rational, and non-cultural state of extreme absurdity. The actual consequences of this research intention and direction are to a certain extent to dissolve and violate the nature and direction of socialist literature, making some recent creations and works alienate society, neglect the people, and become detached from the land that nourished them—the mother, floating in the air like Antaeus.

From the perspective of epistemology, if we examine modern Western literary concepts and trends with a dialectical perspective, we can easily find that they contain a certain degree of rationality in their position within the network system and overall framework of the essence of literature. If we arbitrarily exaggerate and exceed their own position, break through their own boundaries and scope of application, and elevate them to a literary view that covers everything, it will lead to absurdity. From the competition of literary concepts, we have seen a very interesting phenomenon: almost all literary theory workers regard the literary discipline they study as the master that contains and covers all aspects of the essence of literature. Literary sociologists go to Western literary trends to find literary sociology views, emphasizing the social essence of literature; literary aestheticians go to Western literary trends to collect literary aesthetics views, advocating the aesthetic essence of literature; literary psychologists go to Western literary trends to excavate literary psychology views, promoting the psychological essence of literature; literary formal symbol linguists go to Western literary trends to explore the factors of literary formal symbol linguistics, exaggerating the formal symbol linguistic characteristics of literature, and so on. Although these literary research intentions and perspectives have enriched the understanding of the essence of literature from different aspects, they are not without one-sided, profound, and metaphysical marks. Only by using the thought method of Marxist materialist dialectics, transforming various literary views with reasonable cores, according to their own existence characteristics and internal structural laws, incorporating them into the macro framework and network system of the essence of literature, placing them in their own positions or coordinates, can we form a comprehensive and complete understanding of the essence of literature. Only in this way can we construct a harmonious and orderly Marxist literary theory of contemporary form that is both diverse and unified.

　　用马克思主义观点指导文学研究
    陆贵山
    邓小平同志号召文艺理论工作者用马克思主义的观点指导文学研究。他说：“文科也要有理论研究，用马克思主义观点研究经济、历史、政法、哲学、文学等等。”（《邓小平论文艺》第100页）他指出，西方的一些进步的严肃的学者和作家的著作和作品中包含着有价值的有意义的合理内核，对这些有益的知识和文化，我们应当有选择地引进和吸取，闭关自守、故步自封是狭隘的、愚蛮的；但同时又告诫我们，对文艺作品、文艺观念和文艺思潮这些“属于文化领域的东西，一定要用马克思主义对它们的思想内容和表现方法进行分析、鉴别和批判”。（《邓小平论文艺》第84页）
    改革开放以来，西方文艺思潮潮水般涌入中国，给文坛以强烈的冲击和震撼，带来了骚动和喧哗，产生了某种失衡和倾斜。那些新奇、怪异乃至荒诞的文艺现象，乱花迷眼，令人眩目，感到困惑和迷茫。这中间，既有启人心智的精神成果，也有腐朽的病态的思想毒素；既引发了竞争机制，萌发了文学研究的生气和活力，同时又向马克思主义文艺学发起了前所未有的挑战；既一定程度上促进了文艺的繁荣，又造成了不可忽视的思想混乱。由于西方文艺思潮的刺激，文艺的“禁区”变成了“闹区”，文艺的“冷门”变成了“热门”，一些有影响的西方文学理论，诸如叔本华、尼采、萨特、弗洛伊德的文学观念，结构主义、接受美学以及各式各样的形式符号语言学乃至现代派的文学作品纷至沓来。中国文坛上出现了“文学方法论热”、“文学观念热”、“文艺心理学热”、“文化热”、“文学本体论热”、“文学主体论热”、“形式符号语言学热”……用短短的几年时间，匆匆走完了现代西方一个世纪的文学历程，几乎把欧美所有的文学新潮重演了一遍。对现代西方文艺思潮的引进，扩展了文艺理论工作者的研究视野，拓宽了文学研究的视角，给发展马克思主义文艺学提供了可资参照的思想材料和发展机缘，这是必须加以肯定的。有的学者力图用马克思主义即历史唯物主义和辩证唯物主义的世界观和方法论对西方文艺思潮进行审慎的剖析，辨其真伪、良莠、利弊、益害，取其合理的思想成分，做出了明显的实绩，深化了对文艺的本质、结构和功能的某些层面的认识。这种正确的研究态度以发展和完善马克思主义文艺学作为出发点和归宿。动机和宗旨都是为了建构马克思主义文艺学的当代形态。有的学人则缺乏这方面的自觉意识，他们付出了辛劳，但缺乏选择的目的性。更严重的是，还有极少数人在资产阶级自由化的影响和浸染下，视西方文艺思潮为圭臬，把具有某些合理内核的思想成分夸大、推崇为宏观意义上的世界观和文艺观。他们的研究不是以马克思主义为指导，也不是为了丰富和发展马克思主义文艺学，而是妄图用西方文艺思潮排斥、取代它。他们从政治和哲学的意义上，提倡文艺和文艺思想的多元化，否认和取消马克思主义文艺学的主导地位和指导作用，利用我们的某些失误和疏漏打开缺口，进而将这些问题加以膨胀，推向极端，大力褒扬唯美主义、形式主义、“为艺术而艺术”，追求“纯审美”、“玩文学”，玩弄语言符号的把戏，甚至随心所欲地从总体上把文学搞到非社会化、非政治化、非道德化、非英雄化、非理性化、非文化化的极其荒谬的程度。这种文学研究的意向和导向所造成的实际后果是一定程度上消融和违背了社会主义文艺的性质和方向，使近年来的一些创作和作品疏远了社会、冷落了人民，变成了离开哺育自己的大地——母亲，飘浮在空中的安泰。
    从认识论的角度看，如果我们用辩证法的观点考察现代西方的文艺观念和文艺思潮，便不难发现它们在文艺本质的网络系统和总体框架所处的位置上包含着一定的合理性。如果随意夸大，超越自身所处的位置，突破自身的界限和适用范围，上升为涵盖一切的文艺观，便会走向反面，导向荒谬。从文艺观念的竞赛中，我们看到了一种非常有趣的现象：几乎所有的文艺理论工作者，都把自己所研究的文艺学科，崇奉为包容和涵盖文艺本质的所有层面的主宰。文艺社会学家到西方文艺思潮中去寻找文艺社会学的观点，强调文艺的社会本质；文艺美学家到西方文艺思潮中去搜集文艺美学的观点，弘扬文艺的审美本质；文艺心理学家到西方文艺思潮中去挖掘文艺心理学的观点，推崇文艺的心理本质；文艺的形式符号语言学家到西方文艺思潮中去探索文艺的形式符号语言学的因素，夸大文艺的形式符号语言方面的特性，如此等等。尽管这些文学研究的意向和视角都从不同的层面丰富了对文艺本质的理解，不乏有片面的深刻的理解，但却烙上了一点论、极端性和形而上学的印记。只有用马克思主义的唯物辩证法的思想方法，把各种具有合理内核的文艺观点，经过改造，按照它们自身存在的特性和内在结构规律，纳入文艺本质的宏观框架和网络系统中，置放于它们自身所处的位置或坐标点上，才能形成对文艺本质的全面的完整的认识。唯有这样，才能建构起和谐有序的既多样又统一的马克思主义文艺学的当代形态。
