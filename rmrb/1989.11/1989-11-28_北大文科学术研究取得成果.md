Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 27th.

Peking University's humanities departments have achieved significant academic research results in recent years.

During the national "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, Peking University undertook more than 170 scientific research planning projects, making it the university with the most projects among national humanities institutions. Most of these projects have already yielded results. For example, the three-volume work "History of Marxist Philosophy" written by Professor Huang Nansen and others has been published and won the Third National Excellent Book Award. The "Special Research on Ancient Chinese History" led by Tian Yucheng is scheduled to be completed in 1990. Among these, the book "History of Chinese Land System" systematically and deeply studies issues related to land transactions and contracts in history using a large amount of newly discovered archaeological materials. The "Research on the Rationalization of Chinese Higher Education Structure" led by Professor Wang Yongquan has also been completed. The National Educational Science Planning Leading Group believes that this project has systematically investigated and studied the changes and historical experiences in China's higher education structure since the founding of the nation. This research won the first-class excellent achievement award from the Chinese Society of Higher Education.

　　北大文科学术研究取得成果
    据新华社北京11月27日电　（记者张宝端）北京大学文科各系所的学术研究近年来取得成果。
    在国家“七五”计划期间，北大陆续承担了170多项科研规划项目，是全国文科类高校中承担项目最多的学校。目前，大多数项目已取得成果。例如黄楠森教授等人撰写的《马克思主义哲学史》现已出版三卷，获得了第三届全国优秀图书奖。田余庆牵头进行的“中国古代史专题研究”，将于1990年全部完成。其中《中国土地制度史》一书，运用大量考古新发现的材料，对历史上的土地买卖、契约等有关问题进行了系统深入的研究。汪永铨教授牵头进行的“中国高等教育结构合理化研究”也已经完成。国家教育科学规划领导小组认为，这个项目对建国以来我国高等教育结构的变化发展和历史经验做了系统的调查和研究。这项研究获得了中国高等教育学会优秀成果一等奖。
