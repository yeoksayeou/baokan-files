Twenty years have passed since Comrade Liu Shaoqi passed away. As one of the founders of socialist China, he was persecuted to death by the likes of Lin Biao, Kang Sheng, and Jiang Qing during the ten-year Cultural Revolution. This cannot but make us living communists miss him even more deeply.

At the founding of the nation, the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, including Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De, all put forward many excellent ideas and proposals on how to build a good economy for New China. Due to my work, I had the opportunity to learn more about some of Comrade Shaoqi's basic views. I felt that his thoughts and proposals were very innovative, and as historical experience, they are still worth reviewing and summarizing today.

I

The victory of the democratic revolution opened up a broad prospect for the country to develop towards socialism. However, due to the complex social environment and severe difficulties, we could not immediately take many practical steps towards socialism. We still had to have a transitional stage of New Democracy. At that time, the national economy was composed of various economic components: state-owned economy was mainly the enterprises confiscated from bureaucratic capitalists, although it was the leading component of the national economy, its share was relatively small; the cooperative economy had an even smaller share; small private economy plus private capitalist economy accounted for a large share. In this stage, how to correctly handle the vast sea of small private economy, and how to correctly guide the development of private capitalist economy in a direction beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, was a major issue in guiding economic work in the early years of the nation.

To solve this major issue, Comrade Shaoqi put forward his own proposals. He believed that the struggle with the capitalists should be mainly conducted through peaceful economic competition. On September 13, 1948, in his speech at the Central Political Bureau meeting, after making a relatively systematic discussion on the main contradictions and the party's struggle strategy in the new democratic society, he said: "We must pay attention to the struggle with private capitalists. The way of struggle is economic competition," "This competition is pervasive and is peaceful competition. Here, there is the question of 'who wins over whom.' If we win the competition, the revolution can be peacefully transformed; if we do not win the competition, the socialist economy will be defeated by capitalism, and we will also fail politically." He also pointed out that the production volume of state-owned industry "at most accounts for 10% to 20% of the entire national economy, precisely because this part is very small, the difficulty comes. Why can't we carry out a socialist revolution? It is because of this." He also wrote an article titled "On New Democratic Economy and Cooperatives," and later gave a report titled "Economic Construction Policies and Problems of New China" at a meeting of the North China Financial and Economic Commission, further elaborating on the views he expressed at the Political Bureau meeting. Chairman Mao fully agreed with Comrade Shaoqi's proposals and instructed Comrade Shaoqi to further think about and analyze the economic nature of New China, write a document, and bring it to the discussion of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee.

He also advocated the organization of supply and marketing cooperatives to build a bridge of proletarian leadership over farmers in the circulation sector, so that millions of small producers would closely follow the proletariat and the Communist Party. He eloquently said: "Whoever leads the market, whoever leads the national economy." He believed that after the proletariat seized power, "the most important, most decisive, and most difficult requirement to achieve is how the Chinese proletariat and the Communist Party will help, educate, and organize the vast majority of Chinese farmers and other small producers, so that they will closely follow us." He said: "China is still a country where small-scale production predominates, still an agricultural country. In such a country, thousands and millions of scattered, independent small producers are linked together through commercial relations and linked with large-scale industry, forming the economic whole of the country and society." Based on these analyses, he proposed: "In the initial and relatively long period of economic construction after the victory of the revolution, it is extremely important to organize consumer cooperatives over a wide range." He believed that organizing such supply and marketing cooperatives "is the most powerful tool to unite small producers," "If the cooperatives are well-run, the leadership over small-scale production will be consolidated." "Without cooperatives, the proletariat cannot lead the peasants economically, cannot achieve the unity of the proletariat and the peasants, which is a decisive issue in the economic construction of New China." Here, I would like to add that in rural areas, the establishment of supply and marketing cooperatives started earlier in the Northeast. The central leaders generally took a supportive attitude towards this new thing, but there were also disagreements on some specific practices. For example, whether the supply and marketing cooperatives should make profits and distribute dividends, Comrade Shaoqi was opposed to it, believing that doing so was of a capitalist nature. Once, when the Central Committee was discussing this issue, the debate was very heated, almost to the point of lunch. Chairman Mao stood up, and in front of Comrades Shaoqi and Zhang Wentian, he said while walking, "Comrade Shaoqi, I do not support your opinion, I support Luo Fu's." Although this was a small matter, it shows that the Central Committee of the Party at that time decided on the action line after full discussion and brewing on many important issues, and there was a lively and democratic atmosphere within the Party.

The above-mentioned proposals made by Comrade Shaoqi provided a certain basis for the formulation of the correct economic construction policies by the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee summarized the wisdom of the whole Party, clearly defined the line and policies of New Democratic construction. This line and the corresponding policies were seriously implemented in the early years of the nation. At that time, Comrade Chen Yun was in charge of financial and economic work. He had a deep understanding and research of China's economic situation and came up with many good ideas. For example, adopting the forms of processing and ordering, unified purchase and marketing, to help those private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood to recover and develop production, which can increase supply and solve the problem of worker unemployment to a certain extent. Again, for example, promoting urban-rural exchanges, allowing free trade of grain and other agricultural products, using price policies to guide farmers, gradually narrowing the "scissors difference" between industrial and agricultural products, which can promote industrial and agricultural production, and also use the method of commodity exchange that farmers are willing to accept, to exchange industrial products from farmers for grain, cotton, and other agricultural and sideline products, improving market supply. Due to the correct handling of the relationship between the state and farmers, and the relationship between state-owned enterprises and private enterprises, our government effectively led the urban and rural markets of the whole country, quickly curbed grain prices, ensured the needs of urban and rural people, overcame the extremely chaotic economic life left by the Kuomintang, such as hyperinflation, soaring prices, grain shortages, and commodity shortages, and quickly restored the national economy, beginning planned economic construction. This cannot but be said to be a miracle in the history of China's economic development.

II

Not long after the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, the War of Liberation entered the stage of advancing towards the complete victory of the nation, and the demand for military supplies increased sharply; with the rapid expansion of the liberated areas, especially the successive liberation of a number of large and medium-sized cities, the supply of daily necessities was also quite difficult. These all urgently needed to be solved. At that time, the bureaucratic capitalist enterprises were being taken over, and it still took a process to restore them to normal production. How to do a good job in uniting and winning over the national bourgeoisie, and quickly restore the production of private enterprises, was an urgent and major issue.

On April 9, 1949, I mentioned in a written report to Chairman Mao that after the liberation of Tianjin, the relevant policies and regulations on industry and commerce and labor relations were not announced in time, and capitalists generally had "three fears": "First, fear of liquidation; second, fear that the Communist Party only cares about the interests of workers; third, fear of not being able to control workers and unable to produce." They were skeptical of the policy of "public-private cooperation and labor-management mutual benefit," showed passivity, and some even wanted to abandon their factories and flee abroad. At the same time, some workers, in the high tide of class struggle, put forward excessively high demands to the employers, which, although unavoidable in the high tide of mass struggle, increased the difficulties faced by private enterprises. According to the statistics of February 15, 1949, in that city, the operating rate of private enterprises was less than 30%. If this situation was not quickly reversed, it would cause enterprise closures, worker unemployment, and would be extremely unfavorable for the final victory of the War of Liberation and the restoration of the entire economic order. Chairman Mao and Comrade Shaoqi both attached great importance to this. Comrade Shaoqi believed that the current revolution was of a New Democratic nature, and the economy was also of a New Democratic nature. It was necessary to allow the existence and development of private capitalist economy, of course, this existence and development must be limited within the scope beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood. To solve this major problem in theory and practice, he went to Tianjin for an inspection in person.

At the beginning of April, Comrade Shaoqi came to the office of the North China Bureau and said to me, "I am reporting to you." He also told me that he would go to Tianjin to inspect work. I said, you are a central leader, go where you need to go, why bother to tell me. Comrade Shaoqi solemnly said, according to organizational principles, it should be done this way. He also instructed me that his activities in Tianjin would be reported to the North China Bureau by the Tianjin Municipal Committee, and then I would report to the Central Committee and Chairman Mao; the Central Committee and Chairman Mao would have any opinions, I would convey them to him. This matter showed Comrade Shaoqi's high degree of organizational discipline, which gave me a deep lesson in party spirit.

Comrade Shaoqi found in Tianjin that after the party's work focus shifted from the countryside to the city, many comrades were not adaptable to the new situation and new problems, especially in dealing with the issue of capitalists, there were many taboos, not paying attention to uniting the national bourgeoisie, not to mention helping them solve difficulties and develop production, but only emphasizing one-sided struggle with them. In response to this situation, Comrade Shaoqi held several symposiums, explaining to people from all walks of life the party's line, policies, and principles for urban work. He criticized the "leftist" tendencies among cadres, pointing out: in dealing with the national bourgeoisie, there is both unity and struggle, but today the focus is on unity rather than struggle; in politics, we should unite them to fight against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and in economics, we should unite them to develop production; it is wrong to only struggle without unity, and it is also wrong to only unite without struggle.

He told workers: under the current conditions, some development of private capitalist exploitation is beneficial to the national economy, beneficial to the state, and beneficial to workers, unemployment is not as good as having a job. In a symposium with industrialists and businessmen, he also talked about: compared with feudal exploitation, capitalist exploitation is progressive, the bourgeoisie has historical merits. Today, capitalist exploitation is legal, the more exploitation, the better. He also encouraged a capitalist who managed his factory well to set up more factories, employ more people, and strive to develop production.

Comrade Shaoqi's speeches in Tianjin were somewhat inappropriate in some words, but his fundamental intention was to stabilize the national bourgeoisie, protect and develop national industry and commerce, quickly restore and develop production, activate urban and rural economies, establish a New Democratic economic order, and support the great cause of liberating all of China. I reported Comrade Shaoqi's speeches to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao thought they were well said, but felt that the phrase "the more exploitation, the better" was not quite appropriate and did not necessarily have to be said that way. He summarized it in sixteen words: "public-private cooperation, labor-management mutual benefit, urban-rural mutual assistance, internal-external exchange," and asked me to convey it to Comrade Shaoqi. Comrade Shaoqi paid great attention to Chairman Mao's scientific summary, saying, "Chairman's way of putting it is of course good, it is comprehensive, in the future we will explain it this way." This is the origin of our Party's implementation of the "four directions" New Democratic economic policy.

After returning to Beijing, Comrade Shaoqi criticized the "leftist" tendencies of the Northeast Bureau in dealing with the issue of the national bourgeoisie. Gao Gang, the Secretary of the Northeast Bureau, was very dissatisfied with this. He not only did not accept the criticism but also copied Comrade Shaoqi's Tianjin speeches into "files" to spread, maliciously creating rumors and attacking Comrade Shaoqi. In the summer of 1953, the Central Committee held a national financial and economic conference, criticizing my shortcomings and errors in the new tax system work, Gao Gang took the opportunity to "criticize Bo Yi Bo and attack Liu Shaoqi," challenging the Party (Gao Gang admitted in his "Reflection" written on April 29, 1954, that in his speech at the conference, "in addition to criticizing Comrade Bo Yi Bo, there was also a meaning of criticizing Comrade Liu Shaoqi"). At the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee in February 1954, which exposed Gao Gang's anti-party conspiracy, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in response to Gao Gang's rumors: "Comrade Shaoqi's speeches were made according to the spirit of the Central Committee. Those speeches played a very important role in preventing errors at that time when we crossed the river to the south and liberated the whole of China. Although there were some flaws in individual words in the speeches, the main role was good. What was the situation at that time? At that time, half of China was not yet liberated. We had just entered the city, and the most feared was 'leftism,' and at that time, 'leftist' tendencies had indeed emerged. Under these circumstances, the Central Committee took a resolute attitude to correct and prevent 'leftist' tendencies, which was completely correct." Comrade Xiaoping's historical evaluation of Comrade Shaoqi's Tianjin speeches at that time was fair and objective.

Under specific historical conditions, it is theoretically and practically correct to allow a certain amount of private capitalist economy to exist and to allow a certain degree of legal exploitation (that is, paying taxes in accordance with the law and obtaining certain profits). At the end of 1956, after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the means of production, Chairman Mao pointed out in a conversation with the responsible persons of the democratic parties that it was necessary to distinguish between situations and implement different policies for the bourgeoisie, appropriately taking care of their interests, and not canceling the fixed income too early. It was necessary to allow the continuation of the free market and private factories. When talking about the emergence of "underground factories" in Shanghai, he said, "underground factories" although they are the antithesis of the state-owned economy, but because of social needs, they have developed, and it is necessary to make them go from underground to above ground, from illegal to legal. State-owned factories take three months to make clothes, cooperatives make pants with one leg long and one short, buttons without holes, and poor quality, so it is necessary to allow the opening of private factories and small shops to compete with the above-ground ones. Even allowing the opening of large private factories, through contracts, not to be confiscated for ten or twenty years. Overseas Chinese invest in factories or investment companies, not to be confiscated for twenty or one hundred years. This is called eliminating capitalism and then doing capitalism. Comrade Shaoqi elaborated on Chairman Mao's thoughts. In a meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, he said, our country has more than 90% socialism, and it is not afraid of a few percent of capitalism, it is a supplement to the socialist economy. Comrades Zhou Enlai and Chen Yun also had similar views. This thought is particularly precious and has played and will continue to play a role in economic construction. Practice has proved that the spirit of Comrade Shaoqi's Tianjin speeches is in line with the general line and general policy of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee on continuing to implement New Democracy, allowing the coexistence of various economic components, and developing China's social productive forces. The party struggle initiated by Gao Gang has long been over, but the inappropriate phrase "the more exploitation, the better" has become a handle, later used by Lin Biao, Kang Sheng, and Jiang Qing and their ilk. They framed charges against Comrade Shaoqi during the "Cultural Revolution," verbally and in writing, attacking one point and ignoring the rest, slandering that sentence as the "manifesto" of developing capitalism. It was not until the Fifth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee that Comrade Shaoqi's case was overturned and vindicated.

III

After the victory of the Chinese revolution, its future must necessarily be socialist. This point was not disputed among the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries. As for how to go to socialism and when to start the practical steps towards socialism, I felt that initially, they had different understandings. Comrade Shaoqi advocated a two-step approach: the first step was to build New Democracy, and the second step was to build socialism. Of course, Comrade Shaoqi believed that the two were not absolutely separated, and in the New Democratic stage, it was necessary to "gradually increase the socialist component in the national economy under possible conditions, strengthen the planned nature of the national economy, so as to gradually and steadily transition to socialism." However, he emphasized that "New Democracy must continue for a period, and it is not enough to be short." In a report, he even emphasized that it was necessary to "struggle for the consolidation of the New Democratic system." Based on this understanding, he was generally in favor of setting up cooperatives in rural areas but did not agree with rushing. He believed that in the New Democratic stage, it was not appropriate to easily shake, weaken, and negate the individual ownership of farmers, and not to be afraid of farmers becoming "rich." Only after 80% of the households developed to a prosperous level of having "three horses, one plow, and one cart," could they voluntarily take the road of mutual aid and cooperation.

Comrade Shaoqi's basic thoughts were most concentrated in his instructions on the report of the Shanxi Provincial Committee and other speeches. In April 1951, the Shanxi Provincial Committee submitted a request report to the Central Committee and the North China Bureau titled "Raising the Old Base Areas' Mutual Aid Organizations to a Higher Level," believing that the mutual aid groups in the old liberated areas showed a spontaneous tendency to develop towards rich peasants, and if this was not corrected, it would cause the mutual aid groups to disperse and dissolve, or turn the mutual aid groups into rich peasants' "manors." The report advocated strengthening and increasing the "public accumulation" and "distribution according to labor" within the mutual aid groups, gradually shaking and weakening the private ownership base, to overcome the spontaneous tendency of farmers, and guide the mutual aid groups to a higher level. After reading the request report, Comrade Shaoqi expressed to the comrades of the North China Bureau: it was not appropriate to take the step of shaking the individual ownership of farmers too early and easily. From individual production to collective farms, this is a revolution in the mode of production, and it is difficult to achieve without mechanization and a certain level of science and culture. The North China Bureau agreed with Comrade Shaoqi's opinion. On May 4 of that year, the North China Bureau replied to the Shanxi Provincial Committee, pointing out that they too early "used the accumulation of public funds and distribution according to labor to gradually shake and weaken the private base until the private base was negated, which was inconsistent with the policy of the Party's New Democratic period and the spirit of the Common Program." On June 29, I published an article in the People's Daily commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Party, criticizing the opinion of the Shanxi Provincial Committee without naming them. On July 3, Comrade Shaoqi also made a written comment on the report of the Shanxi Provincial Committee, sharply pointing out that the idea of "gradually shaking, weakening, and negating the private base, raising the agricultural production mutual aid organizations to agricultural production cooperatives, and taking this as a new factor to 'overcome the spontaneous factor of farmers' was a wrong, dangerous, and utopian agricultural socialist thought." On the 5th, he gave a lecture to a class of students at the Marx-Lenin Institute on "The Historical Tasks of the Chinese Communist Party in the Future," further elaborating on his thoughts. He believed that at present, "in the countryside, it is neither to obstruct or try to avoid the spontaneous tendency of farmers, nor to let it go, but to lead it, control and restrict it appropriately, and prepare for the final victory."

For a provincial committee's report on a major issue of agricultural cooperativization, Comrade Shaoqi criticized it in his personal name, which is allowed by the Party Constitution, but he did not seek the opinions of Chairman Mao and other major leaders of the Central Committee in advance, and then made a reply, which was indeed inappropriate. It is understandable that Chairman Mao had objections to his approach.

Chairman Mao was indeed more insightful. He had a far-reaching vision and saw the two kinds of production enthusiasm shown by farmers after the land reform in rural areas, one was the enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation, and the other was the enthusiasm for individual economy. He cherished and protected both kinds of enthusiasm.

Initially, he underestimated the enthusiasm of farmers for individual economy, but in the process of drafting the "Draft Resolution on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" under his leadership, when he heard a rural writer who did not agree with mutual aid and cooperation but advocated individual farming, he immediately and decisively affirmed the enthusiasm of farmers for individual economy, proposing to protect both the enthusiasm of farmers for mutual aid and cooperation and the enthusiasm of farmers for individual farming, both of which should be protected. Chairman Mao discovered from the mutual aid and cooperation practices in various places a semi-socialist cooperative mode characterized by land shares, based on private property—agricultural production cooperatives, that is, primary cooperatives. He drafted and the Central Committee officially approved the "Resolution," affirming that this primary cooperative was a transitional form to a socialist nature collective farm. It "retains private ownership" and "has more socialist factors"; it adheres to the direction of mutual aid and cooperation and also takes into account the wishes and demands of farmers as small private owners. Practice has proved that the basic idea of this "Resolution" is correct. It is regrettable that later it deviated from the spirit of this "Resolution."

Looking back now, Comrade Shaoqi's comments on the report of the Shanxi Provincial Committee, calling the promotion of mutual aid and cooperation "utopian agricultural socialism," were also excessive and worthy of discussion. In a speech, he also had the one-sided view of emphasizing that without mechanization, cooperativization could not be carried out. However, under the historical conditions at that time, his view of not easily shaking the individual ownership of farmers was correct, timely, and of great significance. His basic views were adopted by the "Resolution." In the old liberated areas after the land reform, there were indeed two noteworthy ideological tendencies in rural areas, namely, the spontaneous tendency to develop towards rich peasants and the tendency of egalitarianism. Preventing polarization was indeed necessary, but it was very inappropriate to take the method of shaking or eliminating the individual ownership of farmers too early. Because this would not be conducive to the development of rural productive forces. In the absence of sufficient development of productive forces, it was very inappropriate to rush to do so. The result could only be to promote egalitarianism, dampen the enthusiasm of farmers, bind everyone together to suffer poverty, and instead hinder or even destroy the development of productive forces.

This point, needless to say, has been proven by later practice and has been noticed by everyone. As for Comrade Shaoqi's one-sidedness in the issue of cooperativization, once Chairman Mao pointed it out, he no longer insisted on it and willingly accepted Chairman Mao's correct views. This shows that in the early days of the nation, Chairman Mao and his comrades-in-arms were indeed close partners working together, and although there were some disagreements on some issues, they could learn from each other's strengths and complement each other. Later, this situation changed, and the errors of impetuousness and recklessness occurred repeatedly.

IV

In the autumn of 1952, the task of restoring the national economy was successfully completed. According to Chairman Mao's proposal and after several discussions by the Central Committee, in 1953, the general line of the Party for the transitional period was formulated, proposing that from the founding of the People's Republic of China to the basic completion of socialist transformation, this was a transitional period. The general line and general task of the Party in this transitional period were to basically achieve national industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in a relatively long period. Looking back now, the proposal of this general line was necessary, timely, and completely correct at that time, and it was far-sighted. Similarly, Chairman Mao's estimate that it would take fifteen years or even longer to complete the task of the three transformations through a gradual transition, like crossing a bridge step by step, was also completely correct and far-sighted. Under the guidance of this general line, we implemented the policy of peaceful purchase of private capitalist industry and commerce, and adopted the approach of gradual transition from low-level to high-level and organization for individual agriculture and handicrafts, which were all innovations in the history of the Communist movement. If we had really worked hard for fifteen years or even longer in the transitional period as originally planned, without rushing for quick results and ups and downs, our achievements in construction would have been much greater, and we could have avoided many deviations that occurred later. Of course, looking back today, to achieve true national socialist industrialization rather than nominal socialist industrialization, fifteen years is too short, and it may take several decades or even longer. Later, Chairman Mao also said that to build our country into a socialist country, it would probably take fifty years, that is, ten five-year plans.

Starting from 1953, the grand construction of the first five-year national economic plan began. Under the joint efforts of the whole Party, the whole army, and the people of the whole country, the progress was relatively smooth, and great achievements were made. To explore the industrialization road suitable for China's national conditions, Comrade Shaoqi asked me to help him organize a symposium with the responsible comrades of the Ministry of Industry and Communications. Through the symposium, he put forward many good ideas, such as correctly handling the relationship between light and heavy industry, coastal and inland areas, and the relationship between industrial construction in peacetime and wartime. Chairman Mao was very interested in knowing this and also asked me to assist him in organizing this kind of reporting meeting. This was an important investigation and research activity of the central leaders on the construction issue. Chairman Mao's "On Ten Major Relationships" was the crystallization of this investigation and research activity.

Later, due to the great deviation in ideological understanding, a series of mistakes were also made in practical work. In the second half of 1955, in the issue of agricultural cooperativization, the so-called "small-foot woman" walking was inappropriately criticized, which led to the premature arrival of the "high tide" of socialist transformation in rural areas. Under the atmosphere of anti-rightist conservatism, all fronts appeared the "leftist" tendency of impetuousness and recklessness, and mistakes such as excessive scale of basic construction, over-high production targets, and excessive credit beyond the plan also occurred one after another. At that time, Comrades Zhou Enlai and Chen Yun, in response to this tendency, timely proposed anti-impetuousness, compressing air, and lowering various indicators. Comrade Shaoqi also opposed impetuousness and recklessness. On February 17, 1956, when listening to the report of the Ministry of Communications, he said: the brain is too hot, the targets set are too high, and there are no conditions to achieve them, this is impetuousness, and it must be prevented. On June 4 of the same year, he presided over a central meeting to discuss the national budget for 1955 and the national budget for 1956, and after hearing Comrade Zhou Enlai report on various contradictions and imbalances in economic construction, he decided to stop impetuousness, compress high targets and large-scale construction, and proceed steadily on the basis of comprehensive balance. On the 10th, Comrade Shaoqi presided over a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, confirming the policy proposed by the Central Committee on the 4th, and made corresponding decisions. Under the guidance of Comrade Shaoqi, the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee drafted an editorial titled "We Must Oppose Conservatism, but Also Oppose Impetuousness" for the People's Daily, which was published in the June 20 issue of the People's Daily. Although anti-impetuousness was later criticized, it was correct and necessary at that time, correcting the "leftist" tendency that had emerged in economic work, and also provided the correct ideological basis for the convening of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and the formulation of the second five-year plan.

The Eighth National Congress of the Party correctly analyzed the main contradictions in our country, making the strategic decision to focus on the development of social productive forces. At the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, Comrade Shaoqi again emphasized: the speed of industrial construction should be based on a solid and reliable foundation, and it should not be too fast. If it is slow, it is wrong, but there is room for maneuver; if it is too fast, there is little room for maneuver. In the issue of construction speed, fast or slow is a matter of method, not a matter of class stance. It is a pity that after the second half of 1957, the correct line and policy of the Eighth Congress could not be continued, and the "Great Leap Forward," which was more impetuous than impetuousness, occurred, causing the national economy to suffer a serious setback.

The experience of history is worth pondering. If at that time, we could still, like in the early days of the nation, pool wisdom, adopt more of Comrade Shaoqi's correct opinions, adopt more of Comrade Zhou Enlai, Chen Yun, and other comrades' correct opinions, and the hearts of the vast number of cadres and the masses could be conveyed to the top, it can be affirmed that we would have made fewer mistakes and taken fewer detours.

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, based on a serious summary of historical experience and lessons, our Party clearly put forward the general policy of taking economic construction as the center, adhering to the four cardinal principles, and adhering to reform and opening up. According to this general policy, we should not only do a good job in reforming the economic and political systems, promoting opening up, and developing economic construction, but also firmly adhere to the socialist direction. The two are indispensable. History has proven that China wants to be rich and strong, it cannot leave the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and it cannot leave the socialist road. We have made various mistakes in the past, but we were not wrong in building socialism. Just take the early days of the nation, the Party's timely proposal of the "one transformation, three transformations" task was correct, and the mistakes mainly occurred in being too hasty and too fast, not acting according to objective laws. The originally planned fifteen years or more of transition, the result was completed in three years; the originally planned to gradually develop primary cooperatives according to the "policy of steady progress," the result was that high-level cooperatives and people's communes followed one after another, changing too fast, working too roughly, and the form was too simple and uniform; the repeated impetuousness in economic construction led to the disaster of the "Great Leap Forward."

In that period, although Comrade Shaoqi had some one-sidedness, for example, to emphasize a certain point, he often emphasized it too much, but in some major issues, his basic spirit was correct, which was to put transformation and construction on a solid and reliable foundation.

Therefore, we often understand his economic construction thoughts in the early days of the nation, often do not forget that we have indeed made the mistake of impetuousness and recklessness, which is beneficial to today and tomorrow. As for some people who talk about and criticize our past mistakes and detours, even proposing the "remedial course" theory, attempting to pull the historical wheel back, that is not only wrong but also foolish and laughable. The correct attitude and method should be to stand on the proletarian standpoint, using the perspective and method of Marxism-Leninism to conduct calm and scientific thinking and discussion, to find the law-like things from the mistakes, to guide our practice, and to build socialism better. This is also the responsibility given to us by history and the times.

Comrade Shaoqi has been gone for exactly twenty years.

The person is gone, but the thought remains, and the style endures. I hereby express my remembrance of him with this article.

    回忆刘少奇同志建国初期的一些经济建设思想
    薄一波
    刘少奇同志逝世二十周年了。他作为社会主义中国的奠基者之一，竟在十年动乱中被林彪、康生、江青之流迫害致死。这不能不使我们活着的共产党人更加深切地怀念他。
    建国之初，毛泽东、刘少奇、周恩来、朱德等老一辈无产阶级革命家对如何搞好新中国的经济建设，都提出过很多很好的思想和主张。由于工作上的关系，我有机会较多地了解少奇同志的一些基本观点。我感到他的这些思想和主张是很有创见性的，作为历史的经验，今天仍值得我们加以回顾和总结。
                         一
      民主革命的胜利，虽然为国家朝着社会主义方向发展开辟了广阔的前景，但是，由于面临着复杂的社会环境和严重的困难，不容许我们马上采取很多社会主义的实际步骤，还必须要有一个新民主主义的过渡阶段。那时，国民经济是由多种经济成分所构成：国营经济主要是没收官僚资本的企业，虽然是国民经济的领导成分，但所占比重较小；合作社经济比重更小；小私有经济加上私人资本主义经济则占很大比重。在这个阶段，如何正确地对待汪洋大海似的小私有经济，如何正确地使私人资本主义经济沿着有利于国计民生的方向发展，是建国初期指导经济工作的一个重大课题。
    为了解决这个重大课题，少奇同志提出了自己的主张。他认为，与资本家的斗争应主要通过和平的经济竞争来进行。1948年9月13日，他在中央政治局会议的发言中，对新民主主义社会的主要矛盾和党的斗争策略作了比较系统的论述后，说：“要注意与私人资本家的斗争。斗争的方式是经济竞争”，“这种竞争是贯串在各个方面的，是和平的竞争。这里就有个‘谁战胜谁’的问题。我们竞争赢了，革命就可以和平转变，竞争不赢，社会主义性质的经济，就被资本主义战胜了，政治上也要失败。”他还指出，国营工业的生产量“顶多占整个国民经济的10％到20％，正是因为这一部分数量很小，困难就来了，为什么不能实行社会主义革命即由于此”。他还写了《论新民主主义的经济与合作社》一文，随后，又在华北财经委的会议上作了题为《新中国经济建设方针与问题》的报告，进一步阐述了他在政治局会议上讲的意见。对少奇同志的主张，毛主席表示完全赞同，还嘱托少奇同志对新中国的经济性质进一步思考和分析，写出文件，提到党的七届二中全会讨论。
    他还主张组织供销合作社，在流通领域架起一座无产阶级领导农民的桥梁，使千千万万小生产者紧紧跟随无产阶级与共产党前进。他精辟地说：“谁领导了市场，谁就领导了国民经济。”他认为，无产阶级取得政权后，“一个最重要最有决定性又最难实现的要求，就是中国无产阶级与共产党如何去帮助、教育与组织中国最大多数的农民及其他小生产者，使他们紧紧地跟随自己前进。”他说：“中国还是一个小生产占极大优势的国家，还是一个农业国。在这样的国家中，千千万万的分散的独立小生产者是经过一种商业关系把他们联系起来，并使他们与大工业联系起来，构成国家和社会的经济整体”。根据这些分析，他提出：“在革命胜利后进行经济建设的最初一个相当长的时期内，在广大的范围内组织消费合作社是极端重要的”。他认为组织这种供销合作社，“是团结小生产者最有力的工具”，“合作社搞好了，就巩固了对小生产的领导权”。“没有合作社，无产阶级就不能在经济上领导农民，不能实现无产阶级与农民的联合，这在新中国的经济建设中是一个带决定性的问题”。这里，我附带说明一下，在农村创办供销合作社，东北开始得比较早。对这个新生事物，中央几位领导同志基本上是取支持的态度的，但在某些具体做法上也是有分歧的。比如，供销社是否要赢利分红，少奇同志是反对的，他认为这样做是资本主义性质的。有一次中央在讨论这个问题时，争论得很激烈，快到吃中午饭了，毛主席站起来，当着少奇、张闻天同志的面，边走边说：“少奇同志，我不支持你的意见，我是支持洛甫的。”这虽是一件小事，但可见当时党中央对许多重要问题都是经过充分讨论和酝酿才决定行动方针的，党内具有生动活泼的民主气氛。
    少奇同志提出的上述这些主张，为党的七届二中全会制定正确的经济建设方针提供了一定的依据。毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，集全党智慧之大成，明确了新民主主义建设的路线和政策。这条路线和相应的政策在建国初期得到认真的贯彻执行。当时，陈云同志主持财经工作，他对中国经济情况的了解和研究也比较深刻，出的主意甚多。例如，采取加工订货、统购包销的形式，扶植那些有利于国计民生的私营企业恢复和发展生产，既能增加供给，又可以在一定程度上解决工人失业的问题。又如开展城乡交流，允许粮食和其他农产品自由贸易，以价格政策指导农民，逐步缩小工农业产品价格的“剪刀差”，这既能促进工农业生产，又能以商品交换这个农民乐于接受的办法，用工业品从农民手里换取粮食、棉花和其它农副产品，改善市场供应。由于正确处理了国家与农民的关系、国营企业同私营企业的关系，我们的政府有效地领导了全国城乡市场，迅速平抑了粮价，保证了城乡人民的需要，克服了国民党遗留下来的恶性通货膨胀、物价飞涨、粮食不足、商品匮乏等经济生活极端混乱的状态，迅速恢复了国民经济，开始了有计划的经济建设。这不能不说是我国经济发展史上的一个奇迹。
              二
    党的七届二中全会结束后不久，解放战争即进入了向全国胜利进军的阶段，军需物资的需要量急剧增加；随着解放区的迅速扩大，特别是一批大中城市的相继解放，生活用品的供应也相当困难。这些都亟待我们去解决。而当时，官僚资本企业正在被接管，使之恢复正常生产还需要一个过程。如何做好团结和争取民族资产阶级的工作，迅速恢复私营企业的生产，是一个刻不容缓的大问题。
    1949年4月9日，我在给毛主席的书面报告中提到，由于天津解放后，没有及时宣布有关工商业和劳资关系方面的政策法令，资本家普遍有“三怕”：“一怕清算，二怕共产党只顾工人利益，三怕管不了工人，无法生产。”他们对“公私兼顾、劳资两利”的政策持怀疑态度，表现消极，有的甚至想弃厂外逃。同时，也由于有些工人在对资斗争中，向资方提出了过高的要求，这在群众斗争的高潮中虽然是难免的，但却增加了私营企业面临的困难。据该市1949年2月15日的统计，私营企业开工率不足30％。这种状况如不尽快扭转，就会造成企业倒闭，工人失业，对夺取解放战争的最后胜利和恢复整个经济秩序都极为不利。对此，毛主席和少奇同志都极为重视。少奇同志认为，现在的革命是新民主主义性质的，经济也是新民主主义性质的，要允许私人资本主义经济的存在和发展，当然这种存在和发展必须限制在有益于国计民生的范围内。为了从理论和实践上解决这一重大问题，他亲自到天津去考察。
    4月初的一天，少奇同志来到华北局机关，对我说：“我来向你报到。”并告诉我，他将去天津巡视工作。我说，你是中央领导同志，该上哪就上哪，何必特意来告诉我。少奇同志严肃地说，按照组织原则，应该这样做。并嘱咐我，他在天津的活动，由天津市委向华北局报告，再由我向中央和毛主席报告；中央和毛主席有什么意见，由我向他传达。此事，表现了少奇同志高度的组织性和纪律性，使我受到一次深刻的党性教育。
    少奇同志在天津，发现党的工作重点从农村转入城市后，许多同志对面临的新情况、新问题很不适应，特别是在对待资本家的问题上，戒律甚多，不注意团结民族资本家，更谈不上帮助他们解决困难、发展生产，而只片面强调同他们作“斗争”。针对这种情况，少奇同志召开了多次座谈会，向各界人士阐述了党的城市工作的路线、方针和政策。他批评了干部中存在的“左”的倾向，指出：对民族资产阶级有联合有斗争，但今天重点在于联合而不在斗争；在政治上要联合他们同帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义作斗争，在经济上要联合他们发展生产；只斗争不联合是错误的，只联合不斗争也是错误的。
    他向工人讲：在目前条件之下，私人资本主义的剥削有若干发展，对于国民经济是有利的，对于国家是有利的，对于工人也是有利的，失业还不如有业。在一次同工商业者的座谈会上，他还谈到：与封建剥削相比，资本主义剥削是有进步性的，资产阶级在历史上是有功劳的。在今天，资本主义剥削是合法的，剥削越多越好。他还鼓励一位把工厂办得不错的资本家多办几家工厂，多安置一些人就业，努力发展生产。
    少奇同志在天津的讲话，有些言辞是不妥当的，但其根本用意，是想稳住民族资产阶级，保护和发展民族工商业，迅速恢复和发展生产，活跃城乡经济，建立新民主主义经济秩序，支援解放全中国的伟大事业。我把少奇同志的讲话向毛主席作了汇报。毛主席认为讲得好，只是觉得“剥削越多越好”这句话不大妥当，不一定这么讲。他概括了十六个字，即“公私兼顾，劳资两利，城乡互助，内外交流”，要我转告少奇同志。少奇同志对毛主席的这个科学概括极为重视，说，“主席这样提，当然好，讲得很全面，今后就照此阐述”。这就是我们党实行“四面八方”的新民主主义经济政策的由来。
    少奇同志回京后，批评了东北局对待民族资产阶级问题上
  “左”的倾向。东北局书记高岗对此极为不满。他不但不接受批评，还把少奇同志的天津讲话抄成“档案”去散布，别有用心地制造流言蜚语，攻击少奇同志。1953年夏，中央召开全国财经会议，批评我在新税制工作上的缺点和错误，高岗借机
  “批薄射刘”，向党发难（高岗在1954年4月29日写的《我的反省》中承认，他在会上的发言，“除批评薄一波同志外，还有指桑骂槐说少奇同志的意思”）。在1954年2月揭露高岗反党阴谋活动的七届四中全会上，邓小平同志针对高岗的流言蜚语指出：“少奇同志的那些讲话是根据党中央的精神来讲的。那些讲话对我们当时渡江南下解放全中国的时候不犯错误是起了很大很好的作用的。虽然在讲话当中个别词句有毛病，但主要是起了好作用的。当时的情况怎么样呢？那时天下还没有定，半个中国还未解放。我们刚进城，最怕的是‘左’，而当时又确实已经发生了‘左’的倾向。在这种情况下，中央采取坚决的态度来纠正和防止‘左’的倾向，是完全正确的。”小平同志当时对少奇同志的天津讲话所作的历史评价是公正客观的。
    在特定的历史条件下，允许适量的私人资本主义经济存在，允许一定程度的合法剥削（即照章纳税，取得一定利润），从理论上和实践上讲并没有错。1956年底，对生产资料私有制的社会主义改造基本完成之后，毛主席在同民主党派负责人的一次谈话中还指出，对资产阶级要区分情况，实行不同政策，适当照顾到他们的利益，不要过早取消定息。要允许自由市场和私人工厂的继续存在。当谈到上海出现“地下工厂”时，他说，“地下工厂”虽然是国营经济的对立物，但因为社会需要，就发展起来了，要使它由地下变成地上，由非法变成合法。国营工厂做衣服要三个月，合作工厂做的裤腿一长一短，扣子没眼，质量差，就应该允许开私营工厂、夫妻店以同地上的作对。甚至允许开私营大厂，通过订合同，十年、二十年不没收。华侨投资开厂或搞投资公司，二十年、一百年不没收。这叫做消灭了资本主义，又搞资本主义。少奇同志对毛主席的这一思想进行了发挥。他在一次人大常委会上讲，我们国家有百分之九十几的社会主义，不怕百分之几的资本主义，它是社会主义经济的一个补充嘛。周恩来、陈云同志也都有过类似的说法。这个思想特别宝贵，在经济建设中已经发挥并将继续发挥作用。实践证明，少奇同志天津讲话的精神，是符合党的七届二中全会关于继续实行新民主主义，允许多种经济成分并存，以发展我国社会生产力的总方针和总路线的。由高岗挑起的这场党内斗争虽然早已结束，而“剥削越多越好”这句不恰当的用语，却成了话柄，后来被林彪、康生、江青之流所利用。他们在“文革”中给少奇同志罗织罪名，口诛笔伐，攻其一点，不及其余，污蔑这句话是发展资本主义的“纲领”。直到党的十一届五中全会，少奇同志的冤案才得以平反昭雪。
                      三
    中国革命胜利后，其前途必然是社会主义的。这一点，在老一辈无产阶级革命家中是没有异议的。至于如何走向社会主义，何时开始社会主义的实际步骤，我体会，最初，他们各自是有不同理解的。少奇同志主张分作两步走，第一步搞新民主主义，第二步搞社会主义。当然，少奇同志认为二者不是绝对分离的，在新民主主义阶段，必须“在可能的条件下，逐步地增加国民经济中的社会主义成分，加强国民经济的计划性，以便逐步地稳当地过渡到社会主义。”但是他强调，“新民主主义要继续搞一个时期，短了不行”。他在一次报告中，甚至强调说，要“为巩固新民主主义制度而斗争”。基于这一认识，他对在农村办合作社大体是赞成的，但不同意过急。他认为，在新民主主义阶段，不可轻易地动摇、削弱和否定农民的个体所有制，不要怕农民“冒富”，只有80％的农户发展到有“三马一犁一车”的富裕程度后，才可由他们自愿地走互助合作的道路。
    少奇同志的这一基本思想，比较集中地表现在他对山西省委报告的批示和其他一些谈话中。1951年4月，山西省委向中央和华北局提出了《把老区的互助组织提高一步》的请示报告，认为老解放区的互助组出现了向富农方向发展的自发倾向，如果不注意纠正，将使互助组涣散解体，或使互助组变成富农的“庄园”。报告主张扶植和增强互助组内出现的“公共积累”和“按劳分配”两个新因素，逐步动摇和削弱私有制的基础，以战胜农民的自发趋势，引导互助组走向更高一级的形式。少奇同志看了请示报告后，向华北局的同志表示：不能过早地轻易地采取动摇农民个体所有制的步骤。由个体生产到集体农场，这是生产方式上的一个革命，没有机械化和一定程度的科学、文化水平是难以办到的。华北局赞成少奇同志的意见。这年5月4日，华北局批复山西省委，指出他们过早地“用积累公积金和按劳分配来逐步动摇削弱私有基础直至否定私有基础，是与党的新民主主义时期的政策和《共同纲领》的精神不相符合的”。6月29日，我在《人民日报》发表纪念党成立三十周年的文章中，未指名地对山西省委的这个意见提出了批评。7月3日，少奇同志也对山西省委的报告作了书面批语，尖锐地指出，那种企图“逐步地动摇、削弱直至否定私有基础，把农业生产互助组织提高到农业生产合作社，以此作为新因素，去‘战胜农民的自发因素’，这是一种错误的、危险的、空想的农业社会主义思想”。5日，他向马列学院一班学员讲述《中国共产党今后的历史任务》时，进一步阐明了他的思想。他认为，目前“在农村中既不是去阻止或企图避免农民的自发趋势，也不是让其自流，而要加以领导，适当地控制和限制，准备最后的胜利”。
    对一个省委提出的事关农业合作化大事的报告，少奇同志以个人名义提出批评，按党章是允许的，但事先没有征求毛主席和中央其他主要领导同志的意见，就进行批复，确实欠妥当。毛主席对他的这个做法有意见是可以理解的。
    毛主席确实比我们高明。他高瞻远瞩，看到了农村土地改革后农民所表现出来的两种生产积极性，一个是互助合作的积极性，一个是个体经济的积极性，对这两种积极性他都珍惜和爱护。
    起初，他对农民个体经济的积极性估计是不足的，而在他主持起草的《关于农业生产互助合作的决议（草案）》征求意见的过程中，当听到一位农村作家不赞成互助合作而主张单干时，他就英明果断地肯定了农民个体经济的积极性，提出既要保护农民互助合作的积极性，又要保护农民单干的积极性，这两种积极性都应受到保护。毛主席从各地的互助合作实践经验中，发现了以土地入股为特征的、以私有财产为基础的半社会主义的合作方式——农业生产合作社，即初级社。他主持起草并由中央正式通过的《决议》，肯定了这种初级社是走向社会主义性质的集体农庄的过渡形式。它既“保存着私有的性质”，又“具有更多的社会主义的因素”；既坚持了互助合作的方向，又照顾了农民小私有者的愿望和要求。实践证明，这个《决议》的基本思想是正确的。遗憾的是，后来偏离了这个
  《决议》的精神。
    现在看来，少奇同志对山西省委报告的批语，把搞互助合作叫做“空想的农业社会主义”，也过分了，确有值得商榷的地方。他在一次讲话中也有过分强调没有机械化就不能搞合作化的片面观点。但是，在当时的历史条件下，他指出不要轻易动摇农民个体所有制的观点，则是正确的、及时的，并具有重要意义。他的基本观点是被《决议》所采纳了的。土改后的老区农村，确实存在着两种值得注意的思想倾向，即向富农发展的自发倾向和平均主义的倾向。防止两极分化确实是必要的，但过早地采取动摇或消灭农民个体所有制的办法是很不恰当的。因为这样做不利于农村生产力的发展。在生产力没有得到充分发展的情况下，急于那样做，其结果只能助长平均主义，挫伤农民的积极性，把大家捆在一起受穷，反而会阻碍甚至破坏生产力的发展。
    这一点，毋庸多言，已被后来的实践所证明，已为人人所体察到。至于少奇同志在合作化问题上的某些片面性，一经毛主席指出，他就不再坚持，心悦诚服地接受毛主席的正确见解。这说明，在建国初期的那些日子里，毛主席和他的战友们确实是密切合作共事的伙伴，在一些问题上虽然有不一致的地方，但是能够互相取长补短，互为补充。后来，这种局面改变了，急躁冒进的错误也就不断发生。
                                 四
    1952年秋，恢复国民经济的任务胜利完成。根据毛主席的提议，并经党中央多次讨论，于1953年制定了过渡时期党的总路线，提出从中华人民共和国成立，到社会主义改造基本完成，这是一个过渡时期。党在这个过渡时期的总路线和总任务，是要在相当长的时期内，基本上实现国家工业化和对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。现在看来，这个总路线的提出，在当时是必要的、及时的和完全正确的，是富有远见卓识的。同样，毛主席估计要用十五年或更长的时间，像过桥那样一步一步地走，用逐渐过渡的办法完成三大改造的任务，也是完全正确的，富有远见卓识的。在这个总路线指引下，我们对私人资本主义工商业实行和平赎买政策，对个体农业和手工业采取由低级到高级逐步过渡和组织起来的方式，在共运史上都是创举。如果按原定设想，真的扎扎实实搞十五年或更长一些时间的过渡，不急于求成、大起大落，我们的建设成就可能要大得多，并且可以避免后来出现的很多偏差。当然，今天看来，要实现真正的而不是字面上的国家社会主义工业化，十五年的时间是太短了，可能需要几十年或更长的时间。后来，毛主席也说过，要把我国建设成社会主义国家，大概要经过五十年即十个五年计划。
    从1953年起，开始了规模宏伟的第一个五年国民经济计划的建设。在全党、全军、全国人民的共同努力下，进展比较顺利，取得了巨大的成就。为了探索符合我国国情的工业化道路，少奇同志曾要我帮助他组织同工交部门负责同志的座谈会。通过座谈，他提出了不少好的想法，例如，正确处理轻重工业的关系、沿海和内地的关系、工业建设中平时和战时的关系等。毛主席知道后很感兴趣，也要我协助他组织这方面的汇报会。这是党中央领导同志在建设问题上的一次重要调查研究活动。毛主席写的《论十大关系》就是这次调查研究活动的结晶。
    后来，由于思想认识上发生了很大的偏差，实际工作上也产生了一系列的失误。1955年下半年，在农业合作化问题上不适当地批判所谓“小脚女人”走路，引发了农村社会主义改造“高潮”的过早到来。在反右倾保守的气氛下，其它各条战线都出现了急躁冒进的
  “左”的倾向，基本建设规模过大、生产指标过高、信贷突破计划过多等失误也相继发生。当时，周恩来、陈云同志针对这种倾向，及时提出反冒进，压缩空气，降低各项指标。少奇同志也是反对急躁冒进的。1956年2月17日，他在听取交通部汇报时说：脑子太热，提的指标太高，没有条件做到，这就是冒进，要防止。同年6月4日，他主持召开中央会议，讨论1955年国家决算和1956年国家预算，在听取了周恩来同志报告经济建设中出现的种种矛盾和不平衡情况之后，就议定了制止冒进、压缩高指标和过大建设规模、在综合平衡的基础上稳步前进的方针。10日，少奇同志又主持中央政治局会议，确认了4日中央会议提出的方针，并作出了相应的决定。在少奇同志的指示下，中央宣传部为《人民日报》起草了《要反对保守主义，也要反对急躁情绪》的社论，发表在6月20日的《人民日报》上。反冒进虽然后来受到指责，但在当时是正确的、必要的，纠正了经济工作中已经露头的“左”的倾向，也为党的“八大”的召开和第二个五年计划的制定提供了正确的思想基础。
    党的“八大”正确地分析了我国的主要矛盾，作出了把工作重点放在发展社会生产力上的战略决策。在八届二中全会上，少奇同志又强调：工业建设的速度应放在稳妥可靠的基础上，不能搞得太快。搞慢点，错了，还有回旋余地；过快了，回旋余地就很少了。在建设速度问题上，快点慢点是个方法问题，不是阶级立场问题。可惜，到1957年下半年以后，“八大”的正确路线和方针没有能够继续贯彻执行，比冒进更冒进的“大跃进”发生了，使国家的经济建设受到了一次严重惩罚。
    历史的经验值得回味。如果当时能仍像建国初期那样，集思广益，多采纳少奇同志的正确意见，多采纳周恩来、陈云和其他同志的正确意见，广大干部和群众的心里话能够上达，可以肯定，我们就会少一些失误，少走一些弯路。
    党的十一届三中全会以后，在认真总结历史经验和教训的基础上，我们党明确提出了以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放的总方针、总政策。按照这个总方针、总政策，我们既要搞好经济体制、政治体制的改革，搞好对外开放，把经济建设搞上去，又要坚定不移地坚持社会主义方向，二者缺一不可。历史已经证明，中国要富强，不能离开中国共产党的领导，不能离开社会主义道路。我们过去虽然犯过这样那样的错误，但并非是错在搞社会主义这一点上。就拿建国初期那些日子来说，党及时提出“一化”、“三改”的任务是正确的，失误主要发生在过急、过快，不按客观规律办事上。原定过渡十五年或更长点时间，结果三年就完成；原定按“稳步前进的方针”先逐步发展初级社，结果高级社、人民公社化接踵而至，改变过快，工作过粗，形式也过于简单划一；经济建设上一再冒进，导致了“大跃进”的灾难。
    在那段时间，少奇同志虽有某些片面性，比如为了强调某一个观点，常常有强调得过分的地方，但在一些大的问题上，其基本精神是正确的，是要把改造和建设置于稳妥可靠的基础上的。
    因此，我们经常领会他建国初期的这些经济建设思想，经常不忘记我们确实犯过急躁冒进的错误，对今天和明天都是有益的。至于有的人对我们过去的一些失误和走过的弯路说三道四，加以指责，甚至提出“补课”论，妄图把历史车轮往回拖，那就不但是错误的，而且是愚妄可笑的了。正确的态度和方法应该是站在无产阶级的立场上，运用马列主义的观点、方法进行冷静的、科学的思索和探讨，从失误中找出规律性的东西，用以指导我们的实践，把社会主义建设搞得更好。这同样是历史和时代赋予我们的责任。
    少奇同志辞世整整二十年了。
    斯人已去，但思想长存，风范永在。我谨以这篇文字，聊表对他的怀念之情。
