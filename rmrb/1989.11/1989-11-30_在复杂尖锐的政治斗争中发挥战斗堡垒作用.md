In the spring and summer of this year, a small number of people took advantage of the student unrest to instigate a planned, organized, and premeditated political turmoil. Our school was severely affected, with a considerable number of students involved in the turmoil. After May 15, some faculty and staff also participated in the support activities. This struggle was heart-wrenching and served as a severe test for our grassroots party organizations. In this complex and sharp political struggle, we adhered to the party's political discipline, maintained unity with the Party Central Committee, and took a clear stance against the turmoil, playing the role of a combat fortress.

**Stand Firm and Take a Clear Stance**

Following our school's usual practice, after the students returned from their winter vacation this year, we conducted a survey of the faculty and students' ideological and political situation. Through research and analysis, we felt that there was a lot of grumbling and resentment among the faculty and students, and rumors were rampant. We anticipated that there might be trouble around May 4. The Party Committee held multiple discussions and reported to the Municipal Committee, preparing for the possibility of trouble this year. However, the death of Comrade Hu Yaobang prematurely ignited the fuse for this struggle.

After the obituary for Comrade Hu Yaobang was published on April 15, the atmosphere on campus was shrouded in a gloomy shadow, and big-character posters began to appear. Starting from April 17, the big-character posters on campus took a clear turn, directing their attacks at the four cardinal principles and the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries. In this complex situation, the Party Committee clearly pointed out: We will not tear down or suppress the mourning big-character posters, but we will tear down illegal and reactionary big-character posters. We will adopt the principle of guiding and persuading as the main approach to actively carry out work.

On April 26, after the "People's Daily" published the editorial "Must Take a Clear Stance Against the Turmoil," the Party Committee immediately convened a meeting of all faculty and staff party members and a meeting of student party members to convey the spirit of the instructions from the Central Committee, the Municipal Committee, and the Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission. We clearly stated that someone was using students' patriotic enthusiasm to create turmoil and required faculty and staff party members not to support student marches and strikes, and student party members not to participate in marches and strikes. Those who did not heed the advice would be severely dealt with according to party discipline. We mobilized all party members, cadres, and teachers to go to the student dormitories, one by one, to do ideological work and persuade them not to go to the march the next day. Some party members even talked to students until 2 a.m. the next day. Early the next morning, the school repeatedly broadcast a notice not to go to the march. Almost all school leaders and many department leaders, office staff, and teachers came out to persuade them. After persuasion, although most students did not go to the march, more than 1,000 students with overheated minds broke down the school gate and went to the streets (our school has more than 7,000 students). Facing this reality, on April 28, the Party Committee convened a meeting of school and department party and government leaders. Secretary of the Party Committee, Comrade Zhu Wanjin, clearly pointed out: The students' march was illegal, but we must distinguish the vast majority of students from the few with ulterior motives. We must see that this is a serious consequence of long-term spiritual pollution and bourgeois liberalization. The school administration also addressed the entire student body via broadcast, requiring all students to return to the classroom starting the next day and to channel their political enthusiasm into diligent study to revitalize China and achieve the Four Modernizations.

On the evening of May 3, we discovered "May 4" student posters in several places on campus, announcing a "flying rally." We quickly found the heads of the school's "Student Self-Governance Association" and repeatedly explained the policy, persuading and guiding them. From their mouths, we learned that some students planned to hold a "tragic ending" the next day, using a flag as a signal to hold a flying rally. Knowing this, we immediately convened an emergency meeting and took four measures: First, we broadcast an emergency notice overnight, persuading students not to go to the streets and warning the organizers to take legal responsibility for any possible consequences. Second, we washed away all big and small posters in the campus overnight, creating a good environment for resuming classes. Third, on the morning of May 4, we actively organized forces to forcibly seize all the flags for the march. Fourth, we talked to the student leaders again.

At around 1:30 a.m. on May 4, the school's party and government leaders, along with a group of cadres, used water hoses to clean the campus of all big and small posters. Early in the morning, we also talked to the main leaders of the illegal student organization, sternly educating them on the law, and confiscated the flags and banners from the marching queue. As a result, that day, fewer than 50 people from Beihang went to Tiananmen Square, and no school flags were displayed. Only about 20 people returned, angrily shouting, "Beihang is cowardly! Beihang is cowardly!"

**Adhering to the Stance of the April 26 Editorial**

After Comrade Zhao Ziyang's speech on May 4 to a delegation from the Asian Development Bank was published, the Party Committee and administrative leaders compared Zhao Ziyang's speech with the spirit of Deng Xiaoping's speech and the spirit of the "April 26" editorial, which was written according to the collective decision of the Central Committee. We clearly felt that Zhao Ziyang had created a separate faction, and his speech did not align with the objective facts of the capital's universities or the actual situation of our school. We gathered the opinions of some active party members and non-party members and, in the afternoon of May 5, sent eight telegrams to the Municipal Committee, clearly expressing our different views and opinions on Zhao Ziyang's speech. For example: "We do not understand the Central Committee's mouthpiece," "Why did the 'People's Daily' publish a photo with the 'Student Self-Governance Union' on the front page?" "We, the grassroots, are made to do the dirty work, while Ziyang does the good work, and we are sold out completely." "We request Ziyang to come out and have a party dialogue with us," etc. Because the Party Committee did not lose its composure due to Zhao Ziyang's divisive actions, our subsequent work was relatively more proactive.

Zhao Ziyang's "Asian Development Bank" speech and the incorrect guidance of the news media caused serious confusion in the school. The heads of the "Student Self-Governance Association" thought they had found a basis for inciting the student movement and became quite arrogant, holding the May 4 newspaper to question the Party Committee leaders, "How are you maintaining unity with the Party Central Committee!" Large and small posters slandering and attacking school party and government cadres also appeared on campus. Facing this rapidly deteriorating situation, on May 5, the Party Committee convened a meeting of branch secretaries and department heads. Party Committee Secretary Zhu Wanjin clearly pointed out that in the previous period, we had seriously implemented the instructions of the Central Committee, actively persuaded students not to march or strike, which was correct. All levels of party organizations should confidently explain this to active members. From May 6 to May 16, in the well-known delicate and complex situation, the school's party and government leadership united as one, based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech and the spirit of the "April 26" editorial, combined with the school's situation, and played the collective wisdom to actively and boldly do guiding work.

Through the efforts of the entire school's faculty and staff, by May 8, 90% of the undergraduates had resumed classes, and the school had basically restored normal teaching order. On May 10, about 200 to 300 students from other schools marched into the Beihang campus, attempting to create chaos again. They shouted, "Beihang, Beihang, do not hesitate!" "Beihang, Beihang, come out of the classroom!" At that time, the heads of the "Beihang Student Self-Governance Association" also gave a speech in front of the library, with about 200 to 300 onlookers. After the marchers left, the students continued to study in the library. Even in the turmoil, on May 13, our school's class attendance rate remained at 90%, and until the third day of the hunger strike (May 15), 50% of the undergraduates were still in class.

After the hunger strike began, the school atmosphere became even more tense. As educators, we were extremely angry at the few with ulterior motives who used students as hostages and extremely saddened that some students were going further down the wrong path. At that time, our policy was: First, do everything possible to prevent the hunger strikers from dying, take effective measures to protect the students' health, and thwart the few people's schemes. Second, persuade the students to stop the hunger strike, leave the scene, and return to the school for treatment as soon as possible. Third, clearly require that party members, in critical moments, must adhere to party discipline, obey the Party Committee's leadership, and stay at their posts. We sent observation groups and medical teams to the square, sending nutrition to the hunger strikers four times a day, with nearly 20 people per shift. On May 18, we took advantage of the rain and the students getting into the cars to send student cadres and active members into the hunger strikers to do work, keeping abreast of the situation. They took measures to prevent students from acting impulsively while doing ideological work for the students, blocking the few people's proposal to disrupt the school boundary and sit in mixed cars, and foiling their scheme to incite and monitor students. At that time, we also understood the teachers' anxiety as educators. The Party Committee convened a meeting of the Standing Committee and school leaders. President Shen Shiquan clearly pointed out: First, we must do everything possible to save the students' lives. Second, we do not agree with the recent news reports. Third, we do not agree with the faculty and staff "supporting" the hunger strikers. The Party Committee, based on distinguishing right from wrong and starting from the actual situation at that time, formulated a correct policy that was principled and acceptable to the broad masses, and promptly reported the situation of our school's students on Tiananmen Square and the emergency measures taken by the school to the faculty and staff to ease their emotions.

On May 19, Comrade Li Peng, on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, spoke at a meeting of the capital's party and government cadres, calling on everyone to urgently mobilize to stop the turmoil. The Party Committee immediately convened an expanded meeting, analyzed the situation within the school, and made four decisions: First, all levels of cadres and party members are not allowed to do anything that affects stability and unity, which is party discipline. Second, do not march or support anymore. Third, all offices, factories, and logistics units must stay at their posts and strictly attend roll call. Fourth, continue to adopt the policy of protecting, caring for, and persuading students. Through the efforts of all parties, the Party Committee's intentions were implemented, except for a few students who participated in the "support," all our school's students who participated in the hunger strike on the square returned to the school. On May 30, the president personally led a team to persuade the last two students and the flag in front of Xinhuamen to withdraw, avoiding greater losses.

In suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, our school's teachers and students, risking their lives, rescued 62 soldiers and 65,000 yuan worth of military supplies in five separate incidents. Party members played a key role. Party member Wang Xiushen, despite the surrounding mob's crazy heckling, rescued two injured soldiers from the crowd and took them to the school hospital for treatment, and then took them home for careful care.

After suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, on June 8, our school convened an expanded meeting of the Party Committee, analyzed the situation, and, in conjunction with the school's actual situation, proposed ten requirements for party members. We required all party members in the school to stand firm and take a clear stance to defend the party's leadership and the socialist system; to enhance revolutionary vigilance, not to spread rumors, and strictly adhere to party political discipline; to model the observance of martial law; to patiently persuade and seriously criticize the masses' impulsive behavior; to take the lead in restoring normal teaching and work order, etc. The State Education Commission, the Aerospace Industry Department, and the Beijing Municipal Committee's Education Department all forwarded these ten points.

In this student movement, turmoil, and counter-revolutionary rebellion, a few students indeed became the core members of inciting, organizing, and leading the turmoil and rebellion, committing serious errors, and some even violated the law. To investigate these people and incidents, on June 14, the Standing Committee of the Party Committee decided to establish a leading group for the investigation and rectification work, headed by the secretary of the Discipline Inspection Commission, to investigate and rectify key people and incidents.

**Playing the Political Core Role of the Party Organization**

We did not expect this turmoil to come early, but we were not caught off guard. The party's core role in the school has not changed, and the party's ideological and political work team is relatively stable, which laid a solid foundation for us to get through this turmoil.

According to the instructions from higher authorities, our school began to trial the principal responsibility system in July 1985. During the trial of the principal responsibility system, party and government leaders seriously studied and understood the spirit of the Thirteenth Party Congress and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's consistent thoughts. One point is clear: the party's role cannot be reduced, and ideological and political work cannot be weakened. In recent years, as the general secretary, Comrade Zhao Ziyang, under the pretext of "adaptation," proposed "reforming ideological and political work," and some people talked about "the party's leadership should be diluted, party cadres should be part-time, and party activities should be part-time," and promoted these as "reform experiences." We believe that these so-called experiences do not fit the actual situation of Beihang. In the trial of the principal responsibility system, our party and government leaders had a common and clear understanding: the party and government functions should be separated, but we should adhere to the "four unchanging" and "three principles." The "four unchanging" are: the Party Committee's political core role in the school does not change; the Party Committee's position in leading ideological and political work does not change; the traditional system of the Party managing cadres (including the selection, training, and management of administrative cadres) does not change; the Party Committee's leadership relationship with mass organizations such as the trade union, Communist Youth League, student union, and graduate student union does not change. The "three principles" are: the principle of unified party and government goals and each doing their own job; the principle of party and government cadres being honest with each other and uniting as one; the principle of party and government cadres supporting and participating in each other's work.

After the school's leadership system changed, the principal should be fully responsible for cultivating students' moral, intellectual, and physical development, which itself is a strengthening of ideological and political work. At the same time, the Party Committee was freed from heavy administrative tasks, having more energy to study ideological and political work and self-construction. According to statistics, in the two years before July 1985, when the principal responsibility system was trialed, the Party Committee's discussions on ideological and political work and party self-construction accounted for 33% of the agenda. After implementing the principal responsibility system, this increased to 65%. This ensured that the Party Committee had some time to study ideological and political work and party building, fully demonstrating its role in this complex and sharp political struggle. In more than 50 days, the Party Committee convened a total of 52 meetings, including expanded meetings of the Party Committee Standing Committee, meetings of branch secretaries, meetings of deputy section-level and above cadres, meetings of branch secretaries, and meetings of all party members in the school, forming a basic team with the Standing Committee of the Party Committee and school leaders as the core and party members as the backbone. In the turmoil, our political work cadre team, including the main cadres of the school and department student unions, showed strong combat effectiveness.

First, we firmly believed in the correctness of the "April 26" editorial of the "People's Daily." This decision was made collectively by the Standing Committee of the Central Committee, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping, with his far-sighted vision, pointed out the nature of the turmoil, which completely fit the actual situation of Beijing and our school. From the perspective of party nature, we were able to take a clear stance, stand firm, work boldly, and not compromise with erroneous tendencies in more than 50 days. Even when there were two voices in the Central Committee, the news media's guidance was incorrect, and a few people took advantage of this opportunity to spread reactionary propaganda and create and spread various political rumors through various channels in society and the school, making the work extremely difficult. We always adhered to the stance of the "April 26" editorial. Under great pressure, we never acknowledged that the student movement was a "patriotic democratic movement"; we never acknowledged that the "Beihang Student Self-Governance Association" was a legal organization; we firmly supported the legally elected student union and graduate student union.

At the same time, we also used the "April 26" editorial to unify the thoughts of party members, relying on the party's iron discipline to restrict the words and deeds of party members, uniting the broad masses, and ensuring the implementation of the party's line, principles, and policies. In the stages of the student movement, turmoil, and rebellion, we always took a clear stance and proposed strict political requirements for cadres and party members, making the broad masses of party members, in the complex struggle and stormy waves, clearly distinguish right from wrong and strongly unite around the party organization. In the periods of "April 26," "May 4" before and after the implementation of martial law, until June 8, we proposed strict requirements for cadres and party members at different times and in different situations, which had good effects. It was also because we were not resolute and forceful enough in our work during the short period of the Tiananmen hunger strike that a few party members had problems mainly during this time. The positive and negative lessons educated us that at any time, we must strengthen the concept of party discipline and strictly enforce party discipline. We also paid attention to cultivating, tempering, and assessing the cadre team during the struggle. At the beginning of the turmoil, our student work cadres were at the forefront. The Party Committee, from the beginning of the turmoil, proposed requirements for them, caring for them politically. After May 15, we gathered the student counselors, Youth League cadres, and main student cadres at the school and department levels to eat and live together and intentionally sent them to the square in batches to observe the situation and carry out persuasion work. At the same time, they personally felt the harm of the turmoil, increased their political skills, and enhanced their ability to distinguish right from wrong. This also allowed us to bring back a lot of information from the square in time, providing a basis for our correct decision-making. The main leaders of our Party Committee also often combined their political struggle experience with the actual struggle to share their experiences and insights, encouraging young cadres to boost their spirits, firm their beliefs, and withstand the test of political struggle. After more than 50 days of blood and fire, our 70-plus student political work cadre team was politically tempered. After suppressing the rebellion, because of this team, our school's student education, investigation, and rectification work were more proactive.

    在复杂尖锐的政治斗争中发挥战斗堡垒作用
    中共北京航空航天大学委员会
    今年春夏之交，极少数人利用学潮，掀起了一场有计划、有组织、有预谋的政治动乱，我校也深受其害，有相当多的学生卷入了这场动乱，5月15日后部分教职工也参与了声援活动。这场斗争惊心动魄，对我们基层党组织是一次最实际和严峻的考验，在这场尖锐复杂的政治斗争中，我们遵守党的政治纪律，和党中央保持一致，旗帜鲜明地反对动乱，发挥了战斗堡垒作用。
      立场坚定旗帜鲜明
    根据我校历来的做法，今年开春学生寒假返校后，就对师生的思想政治状况进行了调查。通过研究分析，我们感到师生普遍牢骚多，怨气大，小道消息盛传，预感到“五·四”时学生可能会闹事。党委多次进行了分析，分别向市委做了汇报，做好了今年要出事的思想准备。然而胡耀邦同志的逝世提前点燃了这场斗争的导火索。
    4月15日胡耀邦同志逝世的讣告发表后，学校气氛就笼罩上了一层阴影，大小字报相继出现，从4月17日起校内大字报出现了明显的转向，把矛头指向四项基本原则和老一辈无产阶级革命家。在这复杂情况下，党委明确指出：悼念的大字报不撕不压，对非法、反动大字报要撕掉，对学潮采取以疏导为主的方针积极开展工作。
    4月26日人民日报《必须旗帜鲜明地反对动乱》社论一发表，党委立即召开全校教工党员大会和学生党员大会，传达中央、市委、市纪委指示精神，明确提出有人利用学生的爱国热情制造动乱，要求教职工党员不得支持学生游行、罢课，学生党员不准参加游行、罢课，不听劝告者按违反党纪严肃处理。并发动全校党员、干部、教师深入学生宿舍，一个个学生做工作，劝阻他们第二天不要去游行，有的党员甚至与学生谈到次日凌晨2点。第二天一早，学校反复广播了不许去游行的通告，全校几乎所有的校领导和不少系领导、机关干部，包括许多教师都出来做劝阻工作。经过劝说，尽管多数学生没有去游行，但仍有1000多头脑热到极点的学生冲坏了校门上了街（我校在校生7000多人）。针对这一现实，4月28日党委召开了校、系党政领导干部会，党委书记朱万金同志明确提出：学生的游行是违法的，但要把绝大多数学生和极少数别有用心的人区别开来，要看到这是长期以来精神污染和资产阶级自由化造成的严重后果。校行政领导也向全校学生发表广播讲话，要求全校同学从明天起全部回到课堂，将自己的政治热情化为振兴中华、实现四化而刻苦学习的实际行动。
    5月3日晚，我们从校园几个地方发现“五·四”学生要搞“飞行集会”的海报，就赶快找来校“学生自治会”的头头，反复交代政策，说服疏导。从他们嘴里得知，有些学生第二天准备搞一个“悲壮的结束”，以旗为信号，举行飞行集会。知道这个情况后，我们连夜召开紧急会议，采取了四项措施：一、连夜广播紧急通告，劝阻学生上街、警告组织者要为可能发生的一切后果负法律责任。二、连夜洗刷校园内所有大、小字报，创造一个复课的良好环境。三、在“五·四”清晨积极组织力量强行扣留游行的所有旗帜。四、再找学生头头谈话。
    “五·四”凌晨一点多钟，学校党政领导带一批干部，用水龙头把校园大、小字报冲得干干净净。一早又找了学生非法组织的几个主要头头谈话，严肃地向他们进行法制教育，同时没收了游行队伍里的旗帜和横幅，结果那天北航到天安门游行的人数不到50人，没有打出校旗，回来只剩下20几人，气急败坏地喊着“北航窝囊！”“北航窝囊！”
        坚持“四·二六”社论的立场
    赵紫阳同志5月4日接见亚行部分代表的讲话发表后，党委常委和行政领导把赵紫阳同志的讲话与邓小平同志讲话精神、按照中央常委集体决定精神写的“四·二六”社论相对照，明显感到赵紫阳同志另搞了一套，他的讲话不符合首都高校的客观事实，不符合我校的实际情况。我们集中了党内外一些积极分子的意见，在5日下午，给市委发了八条电传，明确表示我们对赵紫阳同志讲话的不同看法和意见。如：“对中央的喉舌表示不理解”，“为什么《人民日报》头版刊登写有‘学生自治联合会’的照片？”“我们基层做恶人，紫阳做好人，我们被出卖得一干二净。”“要求紫阳出来与我们进行党内对话”等。由于党委没有因为赵紫阳同志分裂党的行为乱了阵脚，所以后来的工作相对比较主动。
    赵紫阳“亚行”讲话和新闻舆论的错误导向，在学校造成了严重的思想混乱。“学生自治会”头头以为煽动学潮找到了依据，气焰相当嚣张，拿着5月4日的报纸质问党委领导，“你们是如何和党中央保持一致！”大量谩骂、攻击校党政干部的大、小字报也出现在校园内。面对这急转直下的局势，5月5日党委召开了总支书记、系主任会议，党委书记朱万金同志明确指出，前一段时间认真贯彻中央的指示精神，积极劝阻学生不要游行、不要罢课是正确的，各级党组织要理直气壮地向积极分子讲明这一点。从5月6日到5月16日，在众所周知的微妙复杂的情况下，我校党政领导团结一致，根据邓小平同志的讲话和“四·二六”社论精神，结合学校情况，发挥集体的智慧，自觉、主动、大胆地做疏导工作。
    经过全校广大教职员工的努力工作，5月8日90％本科生都已复课，学校基本恢复了正常的教学秩序。5月10日，有二三百名外校学生到北航校园内游行，企图再次制造混乱，他们高喊：“北航北航，不要徬徨！”“北航北航，走出课堂！”当时“北航学生自治会”头头也在图书馆前发表讲话，围观者有二三百人，游行者离去后，学生继续在图书馆自习。就在动乱中，5月13日我校复课率仍达90％，直到绝食后的第三天（5月15日）本科生上课仍占50％。
    绝食发生后，学校气氛更趋严峻，作为师长，我们对极少数别有用心的人以学生当人质的卑劣作法感到极为气愤；对一些学生在错误的路上越走越远更是十分痛心。当时我们的方针是：一、全力以赴避免绝食学生出现死亡，采取有效措施保护学生健康，挫败极少数人的阴谋。二、尽早动员学生停止绝食，离开现场，回校治疗。三、明确要求，党员在关键时刻要遵守党的纪律，服从党委的领导，坚守工作岗位。我们向广场派出观察小组和医疗小组，一天四班给绝食学生送给养，每班近20人，5月18日我们趁下雨学生进大轿车的机会，把学生干部和积极分子派入绝食学生中做工作，随时掌握情况动态，他们一边采取措施，防止学生发生过激行为，一边做学生的思想工作，杜绝了极少数人提出的要打乱校界混合坐车的作法，粉碎了他们挑拨监视学生的阴谋。当时我们也十分理解教师作为师长，心急火燎的心情，党委召开常委和校领导干部会，沈士团校长明确指出：一、当前要想尽一切办法抢救学生的生命。二、对于最近的新闻报道我们是不赞成的。三、不赞成教职工
  “声援”绝食学生。党委在分清是非界限的基础上，从当时的实际情况出发，制定了既不失原则又能够被广大群众接受的正确方针，及时将天安门广场上我校学生的情况及学校所采取的应急措施向教职工通报，用以缓解教职工的情绪。
    5月19日，李鹏同志代表中共中央政治局常委在首都党政干部会上讲话，号召大家紧急动员起来制止动乱。党委立即召开了党委扩大会，分析了校内形势，做出了四项决定：一、各级干部和党员不允许再干影响安定团结的事，这是党的纪律。二、不要再搞游行和声援。三、机关、工厂、后勤各单位必须坚守岗位、严格考勤。四、对学生仍采取保护、关心、劝导的方针。经各方努力贯彻了党委的意图，除参加“声援”的极少数学生外，我校在广场参加绝食的学生全部返校。5月30日，校长又亲自带人把我校在新华门前静坐的最后两名学生和旗子动员撤回，避免了更大的损失。
    在平息反革命暴乱中，我校师生冒着生命危险，先后五次抢救出62名解放军官兵和6.5万元的军用物资，共产党员在里面起了关键的作用。共产党员王修森不顾周围暴徒的疯狂起哄，把两名受伤战士从人群中救回学校校医院进行治疗，并带回家中精心照料。
    平息反革命暴乱后，6月8日我校召开了党委扩大会，分析了形势，结合学校实际对党员提出了十项要求。要求全校共产党员必须立场坚定，旗帜鲜明保卫党的领导和社会主义制度；提高革命警惕，不信谣、不传谣，严格遵守党的政治纪律；模范遵守戒严令；对群众的过激行为要耐心劝说，严肃批评；带头恢复正常的教学、工作秩序等。国家教委、航空航天部和北京市委教育工作部都转发了这十条。
    在这次学潮、动乱、反革命暴乱中，确有极少数学生已成为煽动、组织动乱和暴乱的骨干分子，犯有严重错误，有的已触犯刑律。为了查清这些人和事，6月14日党委常委决定，由纪委书记牵头成立清查工作领导小组，对重点人和事进行清查和清理工作。
        发挥党组织的政治核心作用
    对这场风波提前到来，我们没有意料到，但我们毕竟不是仓促上阵。党在学校的核心作用没有变，党的思想政治工作队伍相对稳定，这就为我们闯过这一场风波奠定了坚实的基础。
    根据上级指示，我校从1985年7月开始试行校长负责制，在试行校长负责制的过程中，党、政领导干部认真学习领会党的十三大精神和邓小平同志的一贯思想，有一点是清醒的，党的作用不能降低，思想政治工作不能削弱。近几年，作为总书记的赵紫阳同志借口“适应”，提出“改造思想政治工作”，还有人大谈“党的领导要淡化，党的干部兼职化，党的活动业余化”，并作为“改革经验”推广。我们认为，这些所谓的经验至少不符合北航的实际。试行校长负责制，我们党政领导干部有一个共同的明确认识，党政职能要分开，但要坚持“四个不变”和“三条原则”。四个不变是：党委在学校的政治核心作用不变；党委领导思想政治工作的地位不变；党管干部（包括行政干部的选拔、培养和管理）的传统制度不变；党委对工会、共青团、学生会、研究生会等群众组织的领导关系不变。三条原则是：党政目标一致，各司其职的原则；党政干部坦诚相待，团结一致的原则；党政干部互相支持，互相参与的原则。
    学校领导体制转变后，校长要对培养学生的德智体全面负责，这本身也是对思想政治工作的加强，同时党委从繁重的行政事务中摆脱出来，有了更多的精力用于研究思想政治工作和自身建设。据统计，1985年7月试行校长负责制以前的两年，党委常委讨论思想政治工作和党的自身建设，占议题的33％，而到了实行校长负责制后上升为65％。这样就保证党委有一定时间研究思想政治工作和党的建设，在这次尖锐复杂的政治斗争中充分的显示出了它的作用。在50多天里，党委先后召开了党委常委扩大会、总支书记会、副处以上干部会、支部书记会、全校党员大会等总共52次，组成了一支以党委常委、校领导为核心，党员为骨干的基本队伍，在动乱中，我校的政工干部队伍包括校、系学生会主要干部都表现出较强的战斗力。
    首先，我们坚信人民日报“四·二六”社论的正确性。这个决策是中央常委集体决定的，邓小平同志高瞻远瞩点明了动乱的性质，完全符合北京和我校的实际情况。从党性观念出发，我们才能在50多天中旗帜鲜明，立场坚定，大胆工作，不同错误倾向做妥协。甚至在中央出现了两种声音，新闻舆论导向发生错误，极少数人利用这个机会，通过各种渠道在社会和学校中放肆地进行反动宣传，制造和传播各种政治谣言，工作处于非常困难的情况下，我们始终坚持“四·二六”社论的立场，尽管在巨大的压力下，我们始终不承认学潮是“爱国民主运动”；始终不承认“北航学生自治会”是合法组织；坚决支持合法选举产生的学生会和研究生会。
    同时我们也用“四·二六”社论统一党员思想，靠党的铁的纪律来约束党员的言行，团结广大群众，保证了党的路线、方针政策的贯彻落实。在学潮、动乱到暴乱的各个阶段，我们都旗帜鲜明地对干部、党员提出了严格的政治要求，使广大党员在复杂的斗争中，在大风大浪中明辨是非，有力地团结在党组织的周围。我们在“四·二六”、“五·四”前、实行戒严以后，一直到6月8日，分别不同时期，不同情况向干部、党员提出严格要求，都收到较好的效果。也正是由于我们在天安门绝食的短暂期间，对党员工作不够坚决有力，极少数党员发生问题也主要在这段时间。正反两方面教训教育了我们，在任何时候都必须增强党的纪律观念，都必须严肃党的纪律。我们还注意在斗争中培养锻炼考核党员干部队伍。动乱一开始，我校的学生工作干部就站在最前列。党委从动乱初，就对他们提出要求，多从政治上关心他们。5月15日后，又将学生指导员，团委干部，校系两级学生主要干部集中吃、住，并有意分批把他们放到广场上去，观察动态和开展劝导工作，同时让他们亲身感受动乱的危害，增长政治才干，增加明辨是非能力，这样又可及时带回来广场上的许多信息，为我们提供了正确决策的依据。我们党委的几个主要领导干部也经常结合自己政治斗争的经验，结合斗争实际谈体会，谈认识，鼓励青年干部振奋精神，坚定信心，经受住政治斗争的考验。经过50多天血与火的考验，我校70余人的学生政工干部队伍政治上经受了锻炼。平息暴乱后，由于有了这么一支队伍，我校的学生教育，清查、清理工作就显得主动多了。
