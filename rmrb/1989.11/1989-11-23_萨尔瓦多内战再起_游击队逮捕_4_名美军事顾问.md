The Salvadoran civil war has flared up again as guerrillas captured four U.S. military advisors from the Holiday Inn this morning, causing a new wave of turmoil in the city of San Salvador.

A reporter from Mexico's Televisa network reported from San Salvador that after the guerrillas' final battles in the northern districts of the city this morning, most of them have withdrawn from the fighting and retreated to the mountains. Most of the capital has begun to return to normal. However, a guerrilla unit unexpectedly occupied the Holiday Inn, located in the wealthy northwestern district of the capital, and captured four U.S. military advisors staying there.

According to other reports, after the Salvadoran guerrillas detained four U.S. military advisors this morning, the U.S. government stated that it would take all possible measures, including military action, to secure their release.
