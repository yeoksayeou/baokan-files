A group of scholars and party cadres gathered in Chengdu to discuss Deng Xiaoping's thoughts on party building. The seminar on Deng Xiaoping's thoughts on party building began today in Chengdu.

The seminar, jointly organized by the "Study" magazine and the Organization Department of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee, discussed Deng Xiaoping's profound views on upholding the four cardinal principles, opposing bourgeois liberalization, maintaining and improving the Party's leadership, and carrying forward the Party's fine traditions.

Experts and scholars engaged in party-building theory research from various places, as well as practical party cadres, participated in the seminar. The attendees agreed that on the issue of party building, Deng Xiaoping, based on the principle of combining Marxism-Leninism with Chinese reality, put forward a series of views and theories. These are an important part of Mao Zedong Thought. We must deeply study and strengthen our research. Only in this way can we greatly advance the cause of party building.
