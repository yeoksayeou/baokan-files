    The nationwide prosecutors' conference has determined the key focus areas for prosecutorial work in 1990: combating corruption and bribery, and cracking down on criminal activities.

    According to a report by reporters Zhang Zhi Ye and Mao Lei from Beijing on November 29, Deputy Prosecutor-General Zhang Siqing of the Supreme People's Procuratorate stated today that the two main priorities for the nation's prosecutorial work in 1990 are to continue the sustained fight against corruption and bribery, and to thoroughly investigate and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary rioters, continuing to severely punish criminal activities in accordance with the law.

    Statistics show that the number of cases currently under investigation by prosecutorial organs, cases voluntarily surrendered to prosecutorial organs during the period of the notice issued by the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and economic crime cases transferred to prosecutorial organs by relevant departments, total nearly 100,000. Various local prosecutorial organs have accepted approximately 300,000 tips from the public regarding cases.

    Zhang Siqing, at the closing of the nationwide prosecutors' conference today, demanded that various local prosecutorial organs strive to complete the handling of cases involving voluntary surrender and confession during the notice period by the first quarter of next year. He also stated that, in the near future, while prosecutorial organs are handling cases involving voluntary surrender and confession in accordance with the notice, they will also handle a batch of cases that should be severely punished according to the law.

    Zhang Siqing proposed that, this coming winter and next spring, the principle of "eliminating evil to the end, leaving no aftereffects" should continue to be implemented, thoroughly investigating and resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionary rioters and those involved in serious criminal activities such as beating, smashing, looting, arson, and murder. He also stated that various localities should proceed from reality, focus on key areas with poor public security and key targets for suppression, closely cooperate with relevant departments, and accurately and resolutely strike at serious criminal elements.

　　全国检察长会议确定明年检察机关工作重点
　　反对贪污贿赂　打击刑事犯罪
    本报北京11月29日讯　记者张志业、毛磊报道：最高人民检察院副检察长张思卿今天指出，1990年的全国检察工作重点，一是把反贪污、贿赂斗争深入持久地进行下去，二是彻底清查、坚决镇压反革命暴乱分子，继续依法从重从快严厉打击刑事犯罪活动。
    据统计，目前检察机关已经立案的案件，最高人民法院、最高人民检察院《通告》发布期间向检察机关投案自首的案件以及有关部门移送给检察机关的经济犯罪案件近10万件，各地检察机关受理群众举报案件线索约30万件。
    张思卿在今天闭幕的全国检察长工作会议上要求，各地检察机关要争取明年第一季度将《通告》期间自首坦白案件基本处理完。他还表示，检察机关近期内在依照《通告》从宽处理自首坦白案件的同时，还将处理一批依法应该从严惩处的案件。
    张思卿提出，今冬明春要继续贯彻“除恶务尽、不留后患”的方针，彻底清查、坚决镇压反革命暴乱分子和打、砸、抢、烧、杀等严重刑事犯罪分子。他还说，各地要从实际出发，抓住治安状况不好的重点地区和重点打击对象，与有关部门密切配合，稳、准、狠地打击严重刑事犯罪分子。
