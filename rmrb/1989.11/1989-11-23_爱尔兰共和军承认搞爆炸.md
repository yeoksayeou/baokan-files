The Irish Republican Army admitted on the 19th that the landmine that killed three British soldiers in Northern Ireland on the 18th was planted by them.

It also admitted that another car bomb incident on the 18th was their doing. In this explosion, which occurred near a military camp in England, a sergeant had both legs blown off, and his wife was also injured.

Last week, the Irish Republican Army placed a bomb in another car, but the bomb did not explode, and a British general escaped unharmed.

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher strongly condemned these terrorist acts. She said that Britain will take all possible measures to apprehend the perpetrators.

　　爱尔兰共和军承认搞爆炸
    爱尔兰共和军十九日承认，十八日在北爱尔兰炸死三位英国士兵的地雷是他们埋设的。
    它还承认十八日的另一起汽车炸弹事件也是他们干的。在这次发生在英格兰一座军营附近的爆炸中，一位中士被炸断双腿，其妻也被炸伤。
    上星期，爱尔兰共和军在另一辆汽车上安装了一颗炸弹，但炸弹没有爆炸，一位英国将军幸免于难。
    英国首相撒切尔夫人强烈谴责这种恐怖行动。她说，英国将采取一切可能措施将肇事者捉拿归案。
