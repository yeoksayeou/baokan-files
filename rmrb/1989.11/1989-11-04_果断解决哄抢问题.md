    Decisively Addressing the Problem of Mob Looting

    Mob looting, which has spread in recent years, has become a thorny social issue that has caused widespread concern and unease among the public. Every year, the number of disputes arising from mob looting has increased significantly. Many government departments and leaders also often find themselves at a loss over the issue of mob looting. This situation must be given serious attention by all regions.

    The difficulty in addressing mob looting lies in the characteristics inherent to the problem itself.

    From the perspective of the objects being harmed, mob looters target the fruits of labor: in rural areas, this includes apples, peaches, dates, and pears hanging from the trees; in forest areas, it includes trees that have taken years to mature; in industrial and mining bases and along transportation routes, it includes various state-owned materials with practical value, such as pesticides, fertilizers, crude oil, wires, and steel. The fruits of labor are created through the hard work of the people, and their sudden looting is bound to cause distress. Addressing the issue of mob looting inevitably involves the interests of various parties, and this is precisely what makes it difficult to handle.

    From the perspective of the looters' identities, they are mostly ordinary farmers, including men and women, young and old, as well as party members and cadres. They often act in groups, organized by village, team, township, or even county, and carry a certain degree of small-group mentality. Therefore, addressing the issue will encounter significant resistance.

    From the perspective of the methods used in looting, the actions of the perpetrators are open and unhidden. Some take advantage of the moment when people are not paying attention to seize and grab; others use violence or coercion to rob. The motives of the looters are intentional, aiming to seize the fruits of others' labor for themselves. To achieve this goal, they act recklessly and without regard for consequences during the looting. This makes it difficult to stop the looting.

    The occurrence of mob looting is due, on one hand, to the imperfections of the rural contract responsibility system in the early stages of reform and the recent increase in the prices of agricultural and sideline products, which involve issues of income distribution among the people. On the other hand, it is due to the lack of legal awareness and extreme selfishness of some individuals. To address the issue of mob looting, efforts should be made from these two aspects, and the work should be done meticulously to avoid leaving any lingering problems. For example, how to both uphold the legal effect of already signed contracts and implement the principle of "major stability, minor adjustments" in the rural contract responsibility system. Regardless of how complex the cases of mob looting are, mob looting itself is a illegal act that disrupts social order and infringes upon public and private property, affecting social stability and production development. Once mob looting occurs, it must be dealt with decisively and swiftly. The ringleaders and masterminds must be severely punished, and those who commit crimes must be prosecuted according to law. Any leaders who support or participate in mob looting must be firmly investigated and dealt with. In summary, all regions must pay serious attention to the issue of mob looting, and pay even more attention.

### 果断解决哄抢问题

    果断解决哄抢问题
    哄抢，作为近些年蔓延开来的一种棘手的社会问题，已引起广大群众的焦虑和不安。每年，因哄抢引起的有关纠纷案件大量增加。而不少政府部门和领导干部也常为哄抢问题伤脑筋。这种状况，必须引起各地的重视。
    哄抢问题的“棘手”之处，是由于它本身所暴露出的特点所决定的。
    从侵害的对象看，哄抢人把猎取的目标集中在劳动果实上：在农村，是那挂满枝头的苹果、鲜桃、红枣、梨儿；在林区，是那多年成材的树木；在工矿基地、交通沿线，则是许多具有实用价值的国家物资，如农药、化肥、原油、电线、钢铁等。劳动果实是人民群众流着辛勤的汗水创造出来的，顷刻之间的被哄抢，谁能不心疼？处理哄抢问题，必然要涉及到各方利益，而这又恰恰是不容易处理好的问题。
    从哄抢人的身份看，基本上是普通农民群众，里边有男有女，有老有少，也有党员干部。他们行动时，常常以村、组、乡甚至县为集合体，成群结队，且带有一定的小团体情绪，所以在处理时会遇到大的阻力。
    从哄抢的手段看，行为人的行动是公开的、毫不掩饰的。有的是乘人不备，进行抢夺；有的是采用暴力、胁迫的手段，进行抢劫。哄抢人的动机均属故意，目的就是要攫取他人的劳动果实为己有。为达到此目的，在哄抢中不顾一切，不计后果。这就给制止哄抢工作带来难度。
    哄抢问题的发生，一方面是由于在改革初期农村承包制不够完善和近些年农副产品价格提高，涉及到群众收入分配问题引起的；一方面是由于一些人缺乏法制观念、极端的利己主义作祟造成的。解决哄抢问题，主要从这两个方面入手，尽量把工作做细，不留后遗症。比如，怎样做到既维护了已经发生法律效力的承包合同，又贯彻了农村承包制中“大稳定、小调整”的原则。哄抢案件不管多么复杂，但哄抢本身是破坏社会管理秩序、侵犯公私财物的违法行为，影响了社会的安定和生产的发展。哄抢一旦发生，要快刀斩乱麻，果断解决。对于为首分子、幕后策划者要严加处理，构成犯罪的，依法处刑。凡有领导干部支持、参与哄抢行为的，要坚决查处。总之，各地对于哄抢问题一定要重视、重视、再重视。
