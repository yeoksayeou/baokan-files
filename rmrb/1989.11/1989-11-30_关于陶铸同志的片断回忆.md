I first met Comrade Tao Zhu in 1937. After the "7·7" Incident, Beijing (then known as Beiping) was occupied by the Japanese imperialist army. In early August, following the instructions of the underground party organization, I and several comrades left Beijing, traveling through Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, and Kaifeng, and arrived in Wuhan in September. There, we reestablished our organizational ties with the Communist Party of China's Hubei Provincial Committee. According to the instructions of Yang Xuesheng, the head of the Youth Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee, I and several other comrades, including Sun Shishi and Huang Zunwang, enrolled in the Hubei Provincial Rural Propaganda Team Training Class organized by the Hubei Provincial Government's Education Department. This was to allow us to use this legal cover to go to other counties and carry out work after the training class ended. During the training period, underground party members formed a temporary party cell (I served as the cell leader), which was directly led by Comrade Tao Zhu. Tao Zhu had been arrested in 1933 due to a traitor's betrayal and sentenced to life imprisonment. After the "7·7" Incident and the cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang for the resistance against Japan, he was rescued from prison. After his release, the party assigned him to Hubei to serve as a standing committee member and head of the Propaganda Department.

Comrade Tao Zhu's body was extremely weak after the long period of torture in the Kuomintang prison. However, he paid no heed to his own health and immediately accepted the task assigned by the party, throwing himself into intense work. He often came to the training class to discuss work with us. He was slightly hunched, often coughing when he spoke, and his cheeks were sunken due to his frailty. However, his eyes were bright and full of spirit, giving us young comrades who had just graduated with boundless strength.

Comrade Tao Zhu instructed us: Among the hundreds of young people receiving training in the class, most were displaced students. Some had participated in the "December 9th" Movement, and some were members of the National Salvation Vanguard. Therefore, we should establish extensive contacts with them and unite this force closely around the party. In practice, Comrade Tao Zhu's instructions proved to be completely correct. During the more than two months of training, we followed his instructions and successfully completed the tasks assigned by the party.

After Wuhan fell in October 1938, the area around Xiangyang and Fancheng, where the headquarters of the Fifth War Zone was located, faced severe threats from the Japanese invaders. Under this tense situation, Commander-in-Chief Li Zongren of the Fifth War Zone quickly accepted the suggestions of Comrade Qian Junrui and other patriotic democrats, approving the establishment of the "Fifth War Zone Anti-Japanese Work Committee in the Hubei-Henan Border Area." The committee established two parallel organizations: the Guerrilla Command and the Political Guidance Department. Li Zongren appointed Shi Yuling, the Kuomintang magistrate of Suixian, to be the commander of the guerrilla forces, and appointed the patriotic democrats Li Fan and Li Xiangfu as the director and deputy director of the Political Guidance Department, respectively. Comrade Tao Zhu was invited to be a special advisor.

At that time, the party assigned me to be the chief political instructor of the military and political cadre training team jointly run by the Guerrilla Command and the Political Guidance Department. Comrade Yang Xuesheng, the head of the Organizational Department of the Provincial Committee, served as the director of the political training office. Although Shi Yuling strongly opposed Tao Zhu serving as a special advisor, he was helpless in the face of the situation of cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang to resist Japan. In early 1939, due to the political appeasement by the Japanese imperialists towards the Kuomintang government, the Kuomintang reactionaries began to implement a policy of passive resistance to Japan and active opposition to the Communists, instigating their followers and troops to provoke conflicts with our party. At this time, Shi Yuling thought the time was ripe and took the opportunity to attack our party. In February 1939, Li Zongren ordered the dissolution of the Political Guidance Department and the dismissal of its staff. Shi Yuling secretly plotted to arrest Comrade Tao Zhu, and the situation was extremely urgent. After the Hubei Provincial Committee learned of this news, they advised Comrade Tao Zhu to quickly transfer to avoid disaster. Comrades were also concerned about his safety. However, Comrade Tao Zhu remained calm and composed. He said that he needed to discuss and arrange the withdrawal with the provincial committee comrades and determine the future tasks of struggle. He could not leave immediately. After everything was arranged, he secretly left Changgangdian (the location of the Political Guidance Department) and went to the outskirts of Xiangfan to the Cihu River, changing his name to Shi Chengfu. He hid in the Hubei Industrial Cooperative Textile Factory run by Li Fan and Yang Xiandong, continuing to maintain contact with the Hubei Provincial Committee and leading the work of the party in Hubei.

In the spring of 1950, I went to the Victory Hotel in Hankou to visit Comrades Tao Zhu and Zeng Zhi. There was also a fellow villager of Comrade Tao Zhu present, listening to the conversation. He might have been a relative of Comrade Tao Zhu. He requested that Comrade Tao Zhu arrange a job for his son in Wuhan. He said that his son was well-versed in literature, had a deep foundation in classical Chinese, and could write official documents. He hoped to secure an appropriate job for his son. Comrade Tao Zhu asked him, "Does ×× understand the line, principles, and policies of our Communist Party?" This question left the fellow villager speechless. Comrade Tao Zhu patiently told him, "×× teaches in the countryside, which is a good job. You should go back and advise him to continue teaching in the countryside. The revolution needs more people to engage in educational work."

In 1965, I participated in the "Four Cleanups" movement in the Lin'gui area of Guangxi. I felt that the situation of the "four uncleans" there was very serious. As early as 1961 and 1962, when the people's lives were relatively difficult, bad elements took advantage of the situation to carry out disruptive activities, causing ideological confusion. After reporting the above situation to Comrade Tao Zhu, he paid great attention to it. He immediately instructed the local responsible comrades to do more ideological education work, saying, "The ideological battlefield in the countryside must be quickly occupied." Later, he also pointed out that not only in the countryside, but also in the cities, if socialism does not occupy the ideological battlefield, capitalism will. Looking at the various corrupt phenomena that have emerged in some places in our country today, we have an even deeper understanding that the proposition put forward by Comrade Tao Zhu more than twenty years ago still has extremely important practical significance!

　　关于陶铸同志的片断回忆
　　唐滔默
    我是1937年认识陶铸同志的。“七·七”事变后，北平（今北京）为日本帝国主义侵略军占领，8月上旬，我遵照地下党组织的安排，同几位同志以平津流亡同学的身份，离开北平，经天津、青岛、济南、开封，于9月间到达武汉，同中共湖北省委接上组织关系。根据湖北省委青年部长杨学诚同志的指示，我和孙世实、黄遵望等七八位同志，报名参加了国民党湖北省政府教育厅主办的湖北省乡村巡回宣传队训练班，以便训练班结束后，利用这个合法名义分赴外县开展工作。地下党同志在训练班受训期间，成立了一个临时党小组（我担任小组长），由陶铸同志直接领导。陶铸同志1933年因叛徒出卖被捕判处无期徒刑，“七·七”事变后国共合作抗日，经党营救出狱，出狱后党派他到湖北担任省委常委兼宣传部长。
    陶铸同志在国民党监狱的长时期折磨中，身体变得极为虚弱，但是，他不顾自己的健康，立即接受党分派的任务，投入紧张的工作。他经常到训练班找我们研究工作。他有点驼背，讲话时常常咳嗽，因为瘦弱，颧骨显得突出，但他双目炯炯有神，给我们这些刚出校门的年轻同志以无穷的力量。
    陶铸同志指示我们：在训练班受训的几百名青年，多数是流亡学生，其中一些人参加过“一二·九”运动，有的还是民先（民族解放先锋队）队员。因此，应当广泛地同他们建立联系，把这支力量紧密地团结在党的周围。实践证明，陶铸同志的指示是完全正确的，在两个多月的受训期间，我们一直是按照他的指示精神进行工作，顺利地完成了党交付给我们的任务。
    1938年10月武汉沦陷以后，第五战区司令长官部所在地襄阳、樊城一带受到日本侵略军的严重威胁，在这种紧张形势下，战区司令长官李宗仁很快接受了钱俊瑞同志和一些爱国民主人士的建议，批准成立了“第五战区豫鄂边区抗敌工作委员会”，委员会下设立游击总指挥部和政治指导部两个平行机构。李宗仁任命国民党随县地区的专员石毓灵担任游击总指挥，任命爱国民主人士李范一、李相符分别担任政治指导部正、副主任，陶铸同志受聘为特别顾问。
    当时党派我到游击总指挥部和政治指导部合办的军政干部训练团担任总政治指导员，省委组织部长杨学诚同志担任政训处长。石毓灵虽然极力反对陶铸同志担任特别顾问，但在当时国共合作抗日的形势下，也无可奈何。1939年初，由于日本帝国主义对国民党政府进行政治诱降，国民党顽固派开始推行消极抗日，积极反共的反动政策，策动其党羽和军队同我党摩擦。这时，石毓灵认为时机已到，乘机向我党进攻。1939年2月间，李宗仁下令撤销政治指导部，遣散政治指导部的工作人员，石毓灵则密谋逮捕陶铸同志，情况十分危急。鄂中省委得知这个消息后，建议陶铸同志迅速转移，以免遭到不测，同志们也都为他的安全担心。但陶铸同志却镇定自若，他说，他要和省委同志们研究和部署撤离工作，确定今后的斗争任务，还不能马上转移。待一切安排妥当后，他才秘密地离开长冈店（政治指导部所在地），到襄樊近郊的茨河，化名石成佛，在李范一、杨显东办的湖北工合纺织厂隐蔽起来，继续同鄂中省委保持联系，领导着鄂中党的工作。
    1950年春节，我去汉口胜利饭店看望陶铸和曾志同志，有一位陶铸同志的家乡人也在那里，听谈话，他可能是陶铸同志的亲戚。他要求陶铸同志为他的儿子在武汉市安排工作。他说，他的儿子学识渊博，古文根底很深，会写公文，他希望给他儿子安排一个适当的工作。陶铸同志对他说，在我们共产党领导的各部门做工作，必须熟悉党的路线、方针、政策才能胜任，他问那位家乡人：“××懂得我们共产党的路线、方针、政策吗？”这句话，把那位家乡人问得无言回答。陶铸同志耐心地对他说：“××在家乡教书，这工作就很好嘛，你回去以后，劝他安心在家乡教书吧，革命需要更多的人从事教育工作。”
    1965年我在广西临桂地区参加“四清”运动，我觉得那里的四不清情况十分严重，早在1961年和1962年，群众那时生活比较困难，坏人乘机进行破坏活动，造成思想混乱。我把上述情况向陶铸同志汇报后，陶铸同志对此十分重视，他当即指示当地负责同志，要多做思想教育工作，“农村的思想阵地要迅速占领。”后来他还指出，不仅是农村，城市也是一样，思想阵地，如果社会主义不去占领，资本主义就会去占领。看一看现在我国一些地方滋长着的种种腐败现象，使我们更加深刻地认识到，早在二十多年前陶铸同志就已经提出来的主张，至今仍具有极其重要的现实意义！
