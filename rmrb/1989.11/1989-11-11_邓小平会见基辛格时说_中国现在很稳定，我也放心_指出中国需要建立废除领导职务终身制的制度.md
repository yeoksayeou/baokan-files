Today morning, Comrade Deng Xiaoping met with the old friend of the Chinese people, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, at the Great Hall of the People. During the 90-minute meeting, Deng Xiaoping and Kissinger had a friendly, sincere, and in-depth discussion on major issues of mutual concern. This was Deng Xiaoping's first meeting with a foreign guest since he stepped down from the position of Chairman of the Central Military Commission.

When Kissinger entered the meeting hall, the spirited Deng Xiaoping, dressed in a dark gray Zhongshan suit, walked forward with a smile to greet him warmly. In front of dozens of Chinese and foreign journalists, Deng Xiaoping said to Kissinger: "Doctor, hello. This is a meeting between friends. You probably know that I have stepped down. China needs to establish a system that abolishes the lifelong tenure of leadership positions. China is now stable, and I am at ease."

Kissinger said: "You look very well. You will continue to play a significant role in China's development, just as you have in the past. You are the chief architect of China's reform."

Deng Xiaoping said: "I am still a citizen of the People's Republic of China and a member of the Communist Party of China. When needed, I will still fulfill the duties of an ordinary citizen and party member. You are no longer the Secretary of State, but you are still busy with international affairs, aren't you?"

Deng Xiaoping and Kissinger also happily reminisced about their friendly interactions over the years. Kissinger told Deng Xiaoping: "You are one of the few politicians who do more than they say. You have brought about historic changes in China."

During the meeting, Minister of Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Huaqiu were present. After the meeting, Deng Xiaoping hosted a luncheon for Kissinger and his entourage.

It is reported that Dr. Kissinger will depart for his home country by a special plane later this evening.

    邓小平会见基辛格时说
   “中国现在很稳定，我也放心”
    指出中国需要建立废除领导职务终身制的制度
    本报北京11月10日讯　记者周象光报道：今天上午，邓小平同志在人民大会堂会见了中国人民的老朋友、美国前国务卿亨利·基辛格博士。在历时90分钟的会见中，邓小平与基辛格就当前共同关心的重大问题友好、诚挚地进行了深入的交谈。这是邓小平辞去中央军委主席的职务后第一次会见外国来宾。
    当基辛格来到会见大厅时，精神矍铄的邓小平身着深灰色中山装，面带笑容地迎上前去同他热情握手。他当着几十名中外记者的面对基辛格说：博士，你好。咱们是朋友之间的见面。你大概知道，我已经退下来了，中国需要建立一个废除领导职务终身制的制度，中国现在很稳定，我也放心。
    基辛格说：你看起来精神很好，今后你在中国的发展中仍会发挥巨大的作用，正像你在过去所起的作用一样。你是中国改革的总设计师。
    邓小平说：我仍然是中华人民共和国的公民，中国共产党的党员，在需要的时候，我还要尽一个普通公民和党员的义务。你现在不当国务卿了，不也还在为国际事务奔忙吗。
    邓小平和基辛格还愉快地回顾了他们相识多年来的友好交往。基辛格对邓小平说：你是做的比说的多的少数几位政治家之一，你使中国发生了历史性的变化。
    会见时，钱其琛外长、刘华秋副外长在座。会见后，邓小平设午宴款待基辛格博士及其一行。
    据悉，基辛格博士将于今天晚些时候乘专机离京回国。
