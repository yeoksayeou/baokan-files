The roads in Beijing are wide, flat, and well-connected, providing convenience for people's production and daily life. However, in recent years, apart from the fact that road and traffic facility construction has lagged far behind the growth in the number of vehicles and traffic volume, the influx of numerous unwelcome "guests" has added extra burdens to the roads. Therefore, traffic congestion has become common in urban and suburban areas of Beijing, and traffic accidents frequently occur. To understand the current situation of this problem and explore ways to alleviate the contradictions, the reporter recently inspected some major traffic routes in Beijing and visited relevant departments.

**Roads and Sidewalks Crowded with Stalls**

The area around the Beitaipingzhuang Market is a bustling part of Beijing, with a large number of vehicles and pedestrians passing through daily. Now, a market with over 300 stalls occupies the entire pedestrian sidewalk. Additionally, due to the limited space, customers' bicycles are parked on the slow-moving vehicle lane.

Compared to the market, the situation of individual vendors occupying the roads is even more severe. Near Yongdingmenwai Street in Hongxiyuan, there are often many individual stalls operating on the vehicle lane; food stalls renting commercial kiosks have their tables set up on the sidewalk; some tricycle drivers also park their vehicles on the vehicle lane to look for business. At a glance, the street is filled with cars, bicycles, tricycles, and pedestrians all mixed together.

According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal Public Security Traffic Management Bureau, there are 210 markets occupying sidewalks and 290 streets occupied by stalls throughout the city; more than 10,000 licensed individual vendors and over 60,000 unlicensed mobile vendors are mostly occupying sidewalks to sell goods.

**Non-stop Road Construction**

Residents living on the western section of Anda Road are puzzled: do urban construction projects have a long-term overall plan? In 1987, the road was dug up for sewage pipe installation, taking nearly half a year to complete; the road surface was paved for less than a year when, in 1988, it was dug up again for cable installation; and just recently, in October of this year, the road was dug up once more for power line installation. Why can't these pipeline projects be completed in one go? This type of construction, known as the "zipper project," has also appeared in Donghuamen and Yuetan South Street. The delay in urban construction projects is also a significant factor in occupying roads and disrupting traffic order. Some construction teams, in order to take on more projects, often start a new project after working on one for a while, leading to a lack of manpower and inevitably affecting the progress of the work. Additionally, some construction teams do not conduct thorough surveys and designs before starting work, and upon discovering design flaws, are forced to halt the project. A construction team from a certain engineering company, while installing a water supply pipe, did not survey the underground conditions beforehand, resulting in a collision with an air defense facility. The project had to be halted for over two months for resurveying. A construction team from Beijing started a rainwater project on Yongwai Street last July, initially planning to complete it in five months, but more than a year has passed, and the site is still not cleaned up. Even now, there are 10 concrete culverts piled up on the pedestrian sidewalk of Yongwai Street. Recently, the construction of a sewage project on the eastern section of Anda Road has also affected traffic.

The Beijing Municipal Public Security Traffic Management Bureau recently inspected the 3,301 construction sites approved in the first half of this year, finding that only 60% had complete construction measures or could be completed on time. There are 330 sites, accounting for 10% of the total, where the construction site management is chaotic, or the construction period is repeatedly delayed, with no improvement even after inspection.

**Roads Turned into Parking Lots**

Beijing has a severe shortage of parking spaces, so many vehicles have to be parked on the roads.

The northern end of Wangfujing Street, Donghuamen Street, has been turned into a social parking lot, and the original road can no longer function to ease traffic. In the Hongxiyuan area, motor vehicles are often parked randomly on the pedestrian sidewalk.

According to relevant departments, in recent years, 180 social motor vehicle parking lots in Beijing have occupied roads, with a considerable number of parking lots occupying vehicle lanes, covering an area of over 500,000 square meters.

On the afternoon of October 26, on the slow-moving vehicle lane in front of the Beitaipingzhuang Agricultural Market, the reporter saw a sign clearly stating "No Parking of Any Vehicles," but just a few meters away, another sign read: "Non-motorized vehicles park to the east," followed by over 40 tricycles occupying the slow-moving vehicle lane; in front of the Tiantan Commercial Building, bicycles parked by customers stretched from the entrance of the building to the pedestrian sidewalk; slow-moving vehicle lanes also had scattered bicycles parked by customers. Even in bicycle parking areas, the road occupation problem is quite serious. There are over 900 bicycle parking areas within the Third Ring Road in Beijing, covering an area of 92,000 square meters, of which 74.2% of the area is occupied by pedestrian and vehicle lanes for parking.

**Calls from Society**

To change the severe situation of roads being occupied, relevant departments in Beijing have taken a series of measures and achieved relatively obvious results. However, to fundamentally reverse this situation, it is necessary to mobilize the strength of the entire society for comprehensive governance.

First, responsibilities must be clarified, management strengthened, and laws strictly enforced. Since 1981, the Beijing Municipal Government has approved and issued 33 regulations, documents, and notices related to the management of sidewalk order. As long as each department performs its duties, enforces the law strictly, and investigates and punishes violations seriously, the behavior of occupying roads will be curbed.

Establish and improve relevant regulations. The original fines for illegal individual vendors are generally 10 to 20 yuan, which these vendors do not care about; for the increasing number of unlicensed individual vendors, there is a lack of specific and complete management methods, and it is urgent to formulate new regulations.

Strengthen macro-control over urban construction. Some municipal engineering projects, such as pipeline installation, due to the dispersed investment channels, often result in significant time discrepancies, making it even more necessary to strengthen overall planning and long-term considerations to reduce the "zipper projects" on the roads. In the design of new residential areas, market stall operating areas should be included.

The problem of road occupation is widespread. Therefore, to fundamentally solve it, relevant departments must start from the overall situation, cooperate and coordinate, and work together. The people the reporter contacted all issued calls for everyone to work together to ensure the smooth flow of Beijing's roads!

    马路在呻吟
    本报记者　朱思雄
    北京市的马路，宽阔平坦，四通八达，给人们的生产、生活提供了方便。然而，近几年来，除道路与交通设施建设远远落后于车辆拥有量和交通流量的增长速度外，纷至沓来的众多不速之“客”，又给马路增加了额外负担。因此，在北京的城区和近郊区，道路堵塞已屡见不鲜；交通事故亦时有发生。为了解这一问题的现状和探求缓解矛盾的办法，记者最近察看了北京市的一些交通要道并走访了有关部门。
        车道便道摊点多
    北太平庄商场一带，本是北京市一处繁华的地段，每天过往的车辆行人较多。现在，由300多个摊点组成的集贸市场，占据在整个人行便道上。同时，因地方狭窄，顾客的自行车又存放在慢行车道上。
    与集贸市场相比，零散摊商挤占道路经营现象更为严重。木樨园附近的永定门外大街上，经常有许多个体摊点在车行道上经营；租用商亭的饮食摊点，有的把餐桌摆在便道上（见上图）；一些揽客的三轮车主也把车子停在车行道上找生意，一眼望去，街上汽车、自行车、三轮车、行人挤在一块。
    据北京市公安交通管理局统计，全市摊群市场占用便道210处，占用街道290条；全市1万多有照零散个体和6万余无照流动商贩大部分都是挤占便道摆摊售货的。
        施工占路无休止
    住安德路西段的居民不禁纳闷：市政工程有的施工到底有没有长远的总体规划？1987年为安装污水管道在这里掘路，工期将近半年；路面刚铺上不到一年，1988年又掘开路面安装电缆线；完工不久，今年10月再一次掘路安装电力管线。同样是管线工程，为什么就不能一次性地掘路安装呢？这类被人们称之为“拉链工程”的施工，在东华门、月坛南街等处都出现过。市政工程施工拖延工期，也是挤占道路，影响交通秩序的一个重要原因。一些承包市政工程的施工队，为了多揽活，往往在接下一个工程干一阵之后，马上又接新的活，由于人力分散，人员不足，不可避免地影响到施工进度。另有一些施工队，施工之前，不作周密的调查设计，施工开始后发现工程设计不合理，被迫停工。一家工程公司的安装队在施工一个上水管道时，由于事先没有摸清地下情况，结果和人防工事相撞，不得不停工重新勘察现场，拖延工期两个多月。北京市一家施工队去年7月承接永外大街的雨水工程，本拟5个月完工，可是一年多过去了，现场还未清理干净，至今还有10根水泥涵管堆放在永外大街的人行便道上。在安德路东段，最近由于进行污水工程施工，也影响了交通（见上图）。
    北京市公安交通管理局最近对全市今年上半年审批的3301处施工占地情况进行了检查，发现施工措施完善或能按期完工的仅占总数的60％，施工现场管理混乱或一再拖延工期，检查后仍无转变的有330处，占总数的10％。
    马路变成停车场
    北京停车场地严重不足，因此，许多车辆只好停放在马路上。
    王府井大街北端的东华门大街，整个道路被迫作为社会停车场，原有道路根本起不到疏导交通的功能。在木樨园一带，经常有一些机动车随便停放在人行便道上。
    据有关部门介绍，近几年来，北京市有180多处社会机动车停车场占用道路，其中相当部分停车场是占用车行道，占地面积达50多万平方米。
    10月26日下午，北太平庄农贸市场前的慢行车道上，记者见到一块路牌上醒目写着“禁止停放一切车辆”，而就在不到5米远的地方同时又树着另一块路牌：“非机动车由此往东停放”，接着是40余辆三轮车挤占在慢行车道上；在天坛商场门前，停放的自行车由商场大门前一直延伸到人行便道；慢行车道上也能见到顾客零零散散停放的自行车。即使是自行车存车处，占路问题亦相当严重，北京市三环路以内现有自行车存车处900多处，占地面积9.2万多平方米，其中占用人行便道、车行道存车的面积约占总面积的74.2％。
        来自社会的呼吁
    为改变道路被挤占的严重局面，北京市有关部门采取了一系列措施，取得了比较明显的成效。但要彻底扭转这种局面，必须动员全社会的力量，综合治理。
    首先，要分清责任，加强管理，严格执法。1981年以来，经北京市政府批准先后制订、发布的有关便道秩序管理的规定、文件、通知等共33件，只要各部门各司其职，严格执法，认真查处，对挤占道路的行为是会有所遏制的。
    建立健全有关法规。原有对违法个体户的罚款，一般10元20元，一些个体户根本不在乎；而对目前日益增多的无照个体商贩，缺乏具体完善的管理办法，迫切需要制定新的法规。
    加强对城市建设的宏观控制。一些市政工程如管道安装等，由于投资渠道分散，往往是谁建楼，谁投资，时间上的错位很大，就更需要加强总体规划，从长计议，尽量减少马路上的“拉链工程”。新建的生活区，在设计时要把集市摊点的经营场地安排进去。
    挤占道路的问题，涉及面很广。因此，要从根本上解决，有关部门必须从全局出发，协同配合，齐抓共管。记者接触到的同志都发出呼吁，大家都来为北京市马路的畅通无阻而共同努力！
