The province of Shaanxi has applied advanced scientific technology to archaeology, successfully and precisely determining the locations of various cultural relics sites for the first time in China, and discovering 37 previously unknown satellite tombs.

Zhao Mausoleum, located in Liquan County, Shaanxi, is the tomb of Emperor Taizong of Tang, Li Shimin. Not far from it is Jian Mausoleum, the tomb of Emperor Suzong of Tang, Li Heng. From September 1987 to August of this year, the National Coalfield Aerial Survey and Remote Sensing Company in Xi'an used multi-temporal aerial remote sensing data. Based on indoor interpretation, they also comprehensively applied photogrammetry and remote sensing technology. Using computers to process data and images, they successfully and precisely determined the locations of various cultural relics sites within the two mausoleum parks. In particular, they precisely determined the locations of 188 satellite tombs, including 37 that had not been previously discovered. After digital processing of these materials, China's first modern cultural relics database was established, which has high academic value. This achievement has opened up a new path for cultural relics archaeology in China.

　　用新技术成功测定文物点
    据新华社西安十一月二十四日电　（记者王兆麟）陕西省把先进的科学技术应用于文物考古中，在我国第一次完整、精确地测定出各类文物点的位置，新发现了三十七座陪葬墓。
    位于陕西礼泉县的昭陵，是唐太宗李世民的陵墓。距此不远的建陵，是唐肃宗李亨的陵墓。从一九八七年九月到今年八月，在西安的国家煤田航测遥感公司运用多时相航空遥感资料，在室内解译基础上，又综合运用摄影测量与遥感技术，用计算机处理数据、图像，完整、精确地测定了两座陵园内各类文物点的位置，特别是精确地测出了一百八十八座陪葬墓的位置，其中包括过去未发现的三十七座。这些资料经过数字化处理后，建立了我国第一个现代化的文物数据库，具有很高的学术价值。这一成果开辟了我国文物考古的新路子。
