We communists adhere to dialectical materialism, but in practical work, some comrades often lack a dialectical materialist approach, which has been a long-standing issue. To better handle the dialectical relationship between the two fundamental points, it is necessary to clarify some ideological boundaries.

1. Political system reform is not a change in the political system of a socialist country. Political system reform is the self-improvement of the socialist system and does not fundamentally change the socialist system. It is not about changing the system of people's congresses, the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.

2. Ownership reform is not a change in socialist public ownership. Ownership reform, under the premise of maintaining the dominant position of the socialist public ownership economy, appropriately adjusts the ownership structure, improves the form of public ownership, and solves problems such as the separation of ownership and management rights. It is not about fundamentally shaking the dominant position of socialist public ownership.

3. Building a highly democratic political system is not about allowing "big democracy." High democracy is people's democracy based on ensuring the rights and fundamental interests of the people; "big democracy" is actually the spread of anarchism and individualism. The two are qualitatively different.

4. Taking productivity as the standard is not about taking making money as the sole standard.

5. Distribution according to work is not about advocating the idea of paying according to contribution. Distribution according to work is the distribution principle of socialism. We have not yet fully implemented it, and this needs to be solved through deepening reform. We are a socialist country, and laborers should take an owner's attitude towards labor. Therefore, while implementing the principle of distribution according to work, we should also advocate the spirit of dedication.

6. Updating ideas is not about completely negating traditional ideas. Traditional ideas should also be analyzed dialectically. For example, the fine national traditions of thrift and hard work, and the fine revolutionary traditions of serving the people and selflessness, we not only should not "negate" but also should carry forward and develop.

7. Separating party and government functions is not about weakening the party's leadership. Separating party and government functions is mainly to solve the problem of party organizations handling too many administrative affairs, leading to "the party not managing the party," and it does not negate the leading role of the party.

8. Acknowledging corruption within the party is not about saying our party is a corrupt party. Countless facts prove that although our party has this or that problem, it was, is, and will be a great, glorious, and correct party. We have the resolve and confidence to overcome the phenomenon of corruption.

9. Allowing some people to get rich first is not about allowing some people to get rich illegally. To adhere to socialism, we must take the road of common prosperity. Allowing some people to get rich first is a correct policy formulated based on the laws of economic development, and its purpose is to gradually achieve common prosperity. We absolutely do not allow some people to take advantage of the reform to get rich illegally.

### 划清若干思想界限

    划清若干思想界限
    我们共产党人信奉辩证唯物主义，但在实际工作中，有的同志往往缺乏唯物辩证法，这已是多年的问题了。为了更好地处理好两个基本点的辩证关系，有必要明确一些思想界限。
    一、政治体制改革，并非社会主义国家政治制度的改变。政治体制改革，是社会主义制度的自我完善，并非根本改变社会主义制度，也不是要改变人民代表大会制度、中国共产党领导下的多党合作制度和政治协商制度。
    二、所有制改革，并非社会主义公有制的改变。所有制改革，是在坚持社会主义公有制经济为主体的前提下，适当调整所有制结构，改善公有制形式，解决所有权与经营权分离等问题，而绝非从根本上动摇社会主义公有制的主体地位。
    三、建设高度民主的政治体制，并非允许“大民主”。高度民主，是以保证人民的权利和根本利益为前提的人民民主；“大民主”实际上是无政府主义、个人主义的泛滥。两者有着质的区别。
    四、以生产力为标准，并非以赚钱为唯一标准。
    五、按劳分配，并非提倡按酬付劳的雇佣观念。按劳分配，是社会主义的分配原则，我们现在还未能充分贯彻，这要靠深化改革来解决。我们是社会主义国家，劳动者应以主人翁态度对待劳动，因而在贯彻按劳分配原则的同时，还应当提倡奉献精神。
    六、观念更新，并非对传统观念的全盘否定。对传统观念，也要一分为二，如勤俭节约、艰苦创业的优良民族传统，为人民服务、大公无私的优良革命传统，我们不仅不能“否定”，而且还要发扬光大。
    七、党政职能分开，并非可以淡化党的领导。党政职能分开，主要是解决党组织包揽过多行政事务以致“党不管党”的问题，并不否认党的领导作用。
    八、承认党内有腐败现象，并非说我们党是腐败的党。无数的事实证明，尽管我们的党有这样或那样的问题，但她过去是、现在仍然是伟大的、光荣的、正确的党。我们有决心有信心克服腐败现象。
    九、允许一部分人先富起来，并非允许一些人违法致富。坚持社会主义，就要走共同富裕的道路。允许一部分人先富起来，这是根据经济发展规律制定的正确政策，其目的是逐步实现共同富裕。决不允许一些人钻改革的空子违法致富。
