Column: Discussion on Politics

Recently, relevant departments in our city conducted a survey on several major national issues involving 100 workers. The results showed that 97 people failed, with an average score of only 20 points. Among them, more than 96% did not know the "one central task and two basic points," the Party's guiding ideology and purpose, and 99% did not know the four major tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee. This reflects the urgent need to strengthen ideological and political work at present.

In recent years, some leaders, when mentioning ideological and political work, would immediately think of building houses, distributing houses, giving money, and distributing goods; otherwise, it would be considered "empty talk." When mentioning ideological and political education, they would think of singing and dancing, traveling, playing cards, chess, and organizing intelligence competitions; otherwise, it would be considered a "leftist" influence. When mentioning the leading role of cadres, they would think of leading the way to get rich; otherwise, it would be considered "incompetent." When mentioning the primary stage of socialism, they would think that one should not demand too much of people; otherwise, it would be considered "detached from reality." Regarding the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, some people believe that "studying it is useless, and using it is ineffective." Therefore, for a period of time, workers' pre-shift and post-shift meetings were canceled, political studies were abolished; only the work of "distributing houses, giving money, distributing goods, and talking about benefits" was emphasized, while ideological and political work, which is related to people's outlook on life and worldview, was neglected, causing many people's values to slide towards "everything for money."

Ideological and political work is multi-level, requiring the resolution of people's current ideological issues and the guidance of people's political direction. The kind of ideological work that only solves immediate interests and uses benefits to win people's hearts is also done by capitalist enterprises, and they are even more skilled at it. However, ideological and political work ensures that people's ideas conform to the proletarian worldview. If we only focus on low-standard ideological work, we cannot guarantee the proletarian direction of people's thoughts, which will only make the masses' appetite for economic benefits higher and higher. This year, a few dozen yuan in bonuses, next year a few hundred yuan, and in 5 or 10 years, how much will it be? Once the economy encounters difficulties, people will not have the spirit to tighten their belts and live frugally, and adhering to the "four cardinal principles" will become empty talk. Therefore, we cannot use solely caring for the masses' lives to replace ideological and political work. Of course, we cannot just talk about "big principles" without doing practical things for the masses.

I believe that at present, we should strengthen the study of the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and solve the problems of people's outlook on life, values, and worldview.

### 经济实惠与思想工作

    经济实惠与思想工作
    最近，我市有关部门就国家大事中的几个问题，抽查了100名职工。结果有97人不及格，平均分数只有20分。其中，不知“一个中心、两个基本点，党的指导思想和宗旨”的分别在96％以上，不知十三届四中全会提出的四件大事的竟占99％，从中看到当前加强思想政治工作的迫切性。
    近几年来，有些领导人一提思想政治工作，就是盖房、分房、发钱、分东西，否则就是“假大空”；一提思想政治教育，就是唱歌跳舞、旅游观光、打扑克下棋、搞智力竞赛等，否则就是“左”的影响；一提干部的带头作用，就是带头富起来，否则就是“没本事”；一提社会主义初级阶段，就是对人不能要求太高，否则就是
  “脱离实际”；对于学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，有的人则认为，“学了用不上，用了也不灵”。因此，在一段时间里，职工班前班后会没有了，政治学习取消了；只抓“分房子、发票子、分东西、讲实惠”的工作，不抓关系着人生观、世界观的思想政治工作，使许多人的价值观滑向了“一切向钱看”。
    思想政治工作是分层次的，既要解决人们的现实思想认识问题，又要把握人们思想的政治方向问题。那种只解决眼前利益，靠实惠笼络人心的思想工作，资本主义企业也在做，而且他们“笼络人心”的手段比我们还高明。但是，思想政治工作是保证人们的观念符合无产阶级世界观。如果我们只抓那种低标准的思想工作，就保证不了人们思想的无产阶级方向，就会把群众单纯追求经济实惠的胃口越吊越高，今年发奖金几十元，明年就得发几百元，5年、10年以后又该发多少呢？一旦经济出现困难，人们就不会有勒紧腰带过紧日子的精神，坚持“四项基本原则”就会成为空话。因此，不能用单纯关心群众的生活去代替思想政治工作。当然，也不能光讲“大道理”，不为群众办实事。
    我认为，当前要加强马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想基本理论的学习，解决好人们的人生观、价值观和世界观等问题。
