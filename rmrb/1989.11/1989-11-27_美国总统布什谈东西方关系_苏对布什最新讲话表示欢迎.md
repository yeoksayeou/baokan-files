Reporter Cang Lide reports: U.S. President Bush tonight delivered a televised address to the nation from Camp David in Maryland, expressing that the United States hopes to work with the Soviet Union to "transcend containment and permanently end the Cold War." However, he also stated that "we cannot ignore" the large Soviet military presence in Eastern Europe, and that as long as Western European allies need it, the United States will continue to maintain its armed forces in Europe.

Bush sketched out a general outline for the upcoming summit between the U.S. and Soviet leaders in the Mediterranean next month. He said that the U.S. and the Soviet Union will seek "mutual understanding" and "assurances" on the current "democratic movements" in Eastern Europe. Bush stated that the United States will not take advantage of the reforms in Eastern Europe but will instead provide support. He hopes that Gorbachev will join him in removing the last obstacles to a "free new world."

When discussing U.S.-Soviet relations, Bush reiterated the five standards he proposed this spring to improve bilateral relations. These include: reducing Soviet military forces, supporting self-determination in Eastern Europe, ending regional conflicts, improving human rights, and cooperating on global issues such as drug eradication and environmental protection.

He said that while the Soviet Union has made "undeniable" progress in these five areas, "serious problems still exist, particularly in regional conflicts."

This was Bush's second televised address to the nation since taking office.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 23rd

Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Grjasimov said on November 23rd that the Soviet Union welcomes Bush's call to use the upcoming summit to shed the policy of containment and thoroughly end the Cold War.

He said that the upcoming summit can allow the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States to calmly discuss European and global situations, seeking common ground on various pressing issues. The summit "may produce some very important practical results."

　　美国总统布什谈东西方关系
　　苏对布什最新讲话表示欢迎
    本报华盛顿11月22日电　记者仓立德报道：美国总统布什今晚在马里兰州戴维营向全国发表的电视讲话中表示，美国希望同苏联一道“跨越遏制，一劳永逸地结束冷战”；但又说，“不能忽视”苏联在东欧的大量军队，只要西欧盟国需要，美国将继续保留其欧洲武装力量。
    布什为美苏两国首脑下月初在地中海举行的首次会晤勾勒了一个大致的轮廓。他说，美苏将就目前东欧“倾向民主的运动”问题寻求“相互理解”和“保证”。布什称，美国不会利用东欧的改革占便宜，而是要“提供支持”。他希望戈尔巴乔夫同他一道拆除通向“自由新世界”的最后障碍。
    在谈到美苏关系时，布什再次提出他今年春天为改善双边关系制定的5条标准。即：削减苏联军事力量，支持东欧自决，结束地区争端，改善人权状况，在扫毒及改善环境等全球问题上合作。
    他说，尽管苏联在上述5个领域已取得“无可否认”的进展，但“严重的问题依然存在，尤其是地区争端”。
    这是布什就任总统后向全国发表的第二次电视讲话。
    新华社莫斯科11月23日电　苏联外交部发言人格拉西莫夫23日说，苏联对布什呼吁利用苏美最高级会晤机会摆脱遏制政策和彻底结束冷战持欢迎态度。
    他说，即将举行的最高级会晤可以使苏美两国领导人从容不迫地讨论欧洲和世界局势，寻求对待各种迫切问题的共同立场。会晤“可能会产生一些非常重要的实际成果”。
