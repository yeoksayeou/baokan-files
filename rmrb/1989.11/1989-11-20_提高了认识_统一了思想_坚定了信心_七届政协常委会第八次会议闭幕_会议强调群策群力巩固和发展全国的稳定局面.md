The eighth session of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) concluded today after four days of meetings. The session was held in the Great Hall of the People and was attended by members of the Standing Committee.

The meeting emphasized the need for all levels of the CPPCC and its members to study and implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC). It also stressed the importance of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to unify understanding, strengthen confidence, and consolidate and develop the stable situation across the country. This is to overcome all difficulties in the process of advancing, achieve new victories in rectification and reform, deepen reform, and build socialism.

Wang Renhe, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, presided over the meeting and delivered a speech. Wang Renhe said that this Standing Committee meeting was very successful. Through in-depth study of the various documents of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the CPC, everyone's understanding has been enhanced, thoughts have been unified, and confidence has been strengthened. With unified thoughts, there can be unified actions, and with a united will, the national economy can be ensured to develop continuously, steadily, and harmoniously.

Wang Renhe said that the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, is a united, pragmatic, and hardworking leadership team. With such a strong core and the concerted efforts of the entire nation, we will definitely be able to accomplish all the tasks proposed by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the CPC.

He said that there are many difficulties ahead, but as long as we boost our spirits, strengthen our confidence, and pool our wisdom and strength, we will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties in our advance. In the process of rectification and deepening reform, it is necessary to strengthen centralized and unified leadership, overcome decentralization, and resolutely stop the unhealthy trend of having different policies at the top and different countermeasures at the bottom.

Wang Renhe said that we must strengthen the Four Cardinal Principles, criticize bourgeois liberalization, and strengthen the Party's iron discipline. We must govern the Party strictly, combat corruption, and strengthen the construction of clean government.

He said that our country is still poor, and we must adhere to the principles of self-reliance, hard work, and frugal nation-building. We must resolutely stop the trend of extravagance and waste and form a social atmosphere where leading cadres take the lead in living a frugal life.

Wang Renhe hoped that after the Standing Committee members return to their respective posts, they will actively support and assist the work of the Party and the government. They should contribute their wisdom and efforts to overcome the current temporary difficulties and achieve new victories in rectification, deepening reform, and socialist construction.

The meeting reviewed and adopted the "Resolution on Studying and Implementing the Spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the CPC." Lu Zhichao, Vice Secretary-General, explained the discussion and revision of the resolution.

The meeting decided to appoint Fan Kang as Vice Secretary-General of the National Committee of the CPPCC. The meeting also adopted the list of additional vice chairpersons and members of some specialized committees of the CPPCC. Ge Zhicheng, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, and Shen Yuan, Honorary President of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, were appointed as Vice Chairpersons of the Committee on Proposals of the National Committee of the CPPCC. Song Deshen, Acting Secretary-General, explained the list of appointments.

Wu Jing (representing Sun Yueshi and Hu Min) and Ma Yuhuai, members of the Standing Committee, expressed their opinions on strengthening coal work and agricultural development, respectively.
