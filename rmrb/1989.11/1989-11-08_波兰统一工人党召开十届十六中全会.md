Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 6th.

The Polish United Workers' Party held the 16th Plenary Session of the 10th Central Committee in Warsaw today. The session discussed the preparations for the 11th Party Congress scheduled to be held on January 27 next year.

The session was chaired by the First Secretary of the Central Committee, Rakowski. In addition to the Central Committee members, representatives of the 11th Congress Preparatory Committee, members of the Polish United Workers' Party in the National Assembly, and the First Secretaries of the provincial committees also attended the meeting.

The session decided that the representatives to the 11th Congress would be elected through a general vote by all party members and candidate members.

This method of electing representatives is unprecedented in the history of the Polish party.

The session tasked the 11th Congress Preparatory Committee with drafting the party's programmatic declaration and constitution, which will then be submitted to the 11th Congress by the Central Committee for discussion.

At a press conference held after the session, Bysztyga, spokesperson for the Polish party Central Committee, emphasized that in light of the lessons from the weakening and even splitting of the Hungarian party, the Polish party should pay attention to party unity when discussing the party's future.

    波兰统一工人党召开十届十六中全会
    新华社华沙11月6日电  波兰统一工人党今天在华沙举行十届十六中全会。全会讨论了筹备定于明年1月27日召开的党的11大问题。
    全会由中央第一书记拉科夫斯基主持。参加会议的除中央委员外，还有11大筹委会代表、波兰统一工人党议员以及各省委第一书记。
    全会决定，11大代表将通过全体党员和候补党员普选产生。
    这种选举代表的方式在波党历史上尚属首次。
    全会责成11大筹委会起草党的纲领宣言和党章，然后由中央提交11大讨论。
    波党中央发言人比什蒂加在全会结束后举行的记者招待会上强调指出，鉴于匈牙利党遭到削弱甚至分裂的教训，波党在讨论党的未来问题时，应该重视党的团结。
