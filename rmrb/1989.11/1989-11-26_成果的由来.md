    The Origin of Achievements
    In Singapore, if you accidentally throw a fast-food bag on the sidewalk, you might be taken to court and fined over five hundred dollars. If someone tosses a cigarette butt into a gutter, plainclothes sanitation inspectors will issue you a summons and fine you two hundred fifty dollars. If public health officials see you spitting in a public place, you will be fined at least one hundred dollars.

    Singapore is a city-state with a population of only 2.6 million. Its roads and sidewalks are impeccably clean, and its parks are free of litter. Today, Singapore has become a "clean green world," which is the result of years of effort by the authorities.

    Among the many measures taken, strict regulations and high fines, consistently enforced, have been the most effective.

    Richard Lim, the director of the Environmental Health Department in Singapore, said, "At that time, we launched public health education and called on citizens to clean the streets every day, removing litter. At the same time, we enacted a series of strict laws against littering. As a result, we found that all these measures were effective."

    Many cities around the world have launched campaigns to stop littering, and relevant authorities have posted signs such as "Litter into the bin." However, these countries rarely implement strict fines, and there is a lack of strict and consistent regulations, so the results are often not significant. The reason Singapore has become the world-renowned "green kingdom" today is that the authorities enforce the law strictly and consistently.

    In the early years of the "Clean City" campaign, hundreds of thousands of people in Singapore received court summonses for littering and were fined.

    In 1984, there were more than 30,000 cases of littering. Today, such cases have been reduced to over 7,000 per year, with fines totaling fifty million dollars.

　　成果的由来
    在新加坡，如果你不慎将一只快餐袋扔在人行道上，你可能被带至法庭，并要课以五百多美元的罚金。如果有人将香烟蒂头扔进街沟，便衣卫生检查员就会给你一张传票，罚款二百五十美元。如果公共卫生官员看见你在公共场所随便吐痰，至少罚一百美元。
    新加坡是一个城市国家，人口仅有二百六十万，马路和人行道上整洁无比，公园里没有杂物可见，今天，新加坡已成为“清洁的绿色世界”，这是当局多年来努力的结果。
    在诸多的措施中，严格的法规，高额的罚款，并持之以恒，是最为有效的。
    新加坡环境部卫生处处长理查德·林姆说：“我们那时开展了公共卫生教育，并号召市民每天上街打扫卫生，清除垃圾，同时，我们还制定了一系列严厉的禁止乱丢杂物的法令，结果我们发现，这一切都行之有效。”
    世界上有许多座城市曾经开展过禁止乱丢杂物的运动，有关当局还张贴诸如“杂物入箱”等告示，然而，这些国家很少制定严厉的罚金措施，缺乏严格的并持之以恒的规定，因此收效往往不大，而新加坡所以今天能变成举世瞩目的“绿色王国”，关键在于当局执法严格、言行一致。
    在开展“清洁城市”运动的头几年里，全新加坡有数十万人由于乱丢杂物接到法院传票，受罚。
    在一九八四年，有三万多起乱丢杂物案件。而在今天，这类案件已经减少到每年七千多起，罚款数目仍有五十万美元。
