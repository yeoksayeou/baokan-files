    Legal Issues to Note During the Cleanup and Rectification of Companies
    Editor's Note: Currently, various regions are implementing the decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to thoroughly clean up and rectify companies. Completing this work will benefit the deepening of reform and opening up, improve the economic environment and economic order; help combat corruption and address issues of unfair distribution; and enhance the authority of the Party and the government as well as social stability. However, cleaning up and rectifying companies is a highly complex task. It involves political, economic, policy, and legal issues. Therefore, it is essential to conduct this work in a solid and practical manner while summarizing experiences. Comrade Wang Rongzheng's letter, from the perspective of judicial practice, raises relevant legal issues in the cleanup and rectification of companies, which can serve as a reference.

    From the situation of cleaning up and rectifying companies in our city, it is evident that the operations of some companies are indeed chaotic, causing significant economic losses to the state and collective entities. In recent years, various economic cases related to companies have also surged, accounting for 40-50% of the economic disputes handled by our court, ranking first. Simultaneously, several legal issues that need attention have been discovered through the judicial process.

    "Upgrading" and "Fundraising" Behind the Scenes
    Some individuals or partnerships have "upgraded" their privately-run companies to collective entities, or collective companies have used the banner of state-owned enterprises. They then use the collective or state-owned banner to sign contracts, secure business deals, collect large advance payments, or obtain bank loans. After obtaining the money, they use various means to convert it into private property. When the business incurs losses and is unable to repay debts, they drag their feet, evade responsibilities, or change names and licenses to escape legal pursuit, thereby harming the property and legitimate rights of the state, collective entities, and individuals. Such cases often involve collusion and conspiracy between both parties, engaging in so-called joint ventures or sales to evade bank supervision and legally obtain funds. One company borrowed 400,000 yuan from a railway system company at a high-interest rate. To evade legal responsibility, both parties signed a steel materials purchase contract to deceive others, but neither party had steel materials, and neither needed them.

    Using job placements, household registrations, and high-interest rates as bait to lure people in. A company in Nanning City had over ten thousand participants in its fundraising, with a total amount raised exceeding 20 million yuan. Nanning City alone has 18 such companies. Their operations are illegal, contract performance is untrustworthy, debt rights are contested, debt obligations are delayed, and personal embezzlement of public and private property is severe.

    Unify Understanding and Work Diligently
    In accordance with the decisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on cleaning up and rectifying companies, and in light of the aforementioned legal issues, I believe that in the process of cleaning up and rectifying companies, it is crucial to unify understanding and establish a legal awareness.

    Work must be meticulous, and procedures must be complete. The primary task in cleaning up and rectifying companies is to determine the nature of the company's ownership and the placement of employees. For companies whose ownership nature was originally determined and meets the requirements at the time of establishment, and whose procedures are complete, the industrial and commercial departments should not alter the nature of the company before rectification. Otherwise, it will cause a chain reaction in rights enjoyment, obligation assumption, and joint liability (debt rights and debts), leading to new legal issues. A company that was originally of collective nature has a supervisory department, and upon deregistration, it should legally have the supervisory department assume the contractual obligations. If it is now determined to change it to a partnership or individual, then the debts of the company upon deregistration would be borne by the partners or individuals. Partners or individuals have the possibility of fleeing or escaping. Legally, the court can suspend or terminate the trial and enforcement due to their escape; while collective or state-owned companies generally do not have this problem. Therefore, stabilizing the original nature of the company is beneficial for maintaining the legitimate rights of the other party. As for the changes and placement of employees, a cautious attitude should be adopted; otherwise, it will lead to new labor disputes.

    During the cleanup of company assets, the inventory must be clear, and there must be records and signatures. When auctioning items, relevant departments such as pricing and commerce should be organized to appraise the quality. Generally, it is prohibited for appraisers, cleanup personnel, and their relatives to retain or purchase items; otherwise, it will create new ambiguities, leading to public misunderstandings or dissatisfaction, and may also result in legal consequences.

    In the cleanup of debt rights and debts and litigation, companies that have not had their business licenses revoked should participate in litigation under the company's name; companies that have had their business licenses revoked and are of collective or state-owned nature should have their supervisory departments or the cleanup team participate in litigation together. The cleanup team cannot replace the supervisory department in litigation, but the supervisory department can participate in litigation independently. Currently, some supervisory departments are afraid of assuming legal responsibilities and have even given up their rights. Some people, seeing that the company currently lacks the ability to pay, advocate for "overstepping" and adding the supervisory department as a defendant, making the supervisory department repay the company's debts. This is not in accordance with legal regulations. As for some supervisory departments emphasizing that the funds and goods of the subordinates that have been deregistered were embezzled by the legal representative or employees of the original company, and should be repaid by the embezzlers, without assuming legal responsibility, this is also not allowed by law. It should be made clear that before the court makes a ruling to suspend or terminate the trial, companies undergoing cleanup and rectification should participate in litigation activities and actively cooperate with the court to conclude the cases.

    The cleanup and rectification of companies should start by establishing and perfecting contract archives, that is, each contract should be stored in a dedicated folder from the time of signing, and all contracts and correspondence, receipts, etc., should be recorded and placed in or copied and recorded in the file. A dedicated or part-time person should be responsible for managing them until the contract is fully performed. This not only facilitates the performance by the parties but also allows the leading and supervisory departments to inspect. When disputes arise or lawsuits are filed, complete and strong evidence can be provided in a timely manner. Companies with internal contracting should also establish files.

    Establish a three-tier responsibility system for company applicants, supervisory departments, and approval and certification agencies. Currently, the chaotic management of some companies is closely related to the fact that the supervisory departments do not manage or rarely manage, and the certification departments do not conduct in-depth investigations but issue certificates based on impressions, relationships, and emotions. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the responsibilities at each level and establish a strict responsibility system. Additionally, during the cleanup and rectification of companies, attention should be paid to issues related to departments that have close dealings with the companies and the corresponding countermeasures.

### 清理整顿公司中应注意的法律问题

    清理整顿公司中应注意的法律问题
    编者按：目前，各地正在按党中央、国务院的决定，认真清理整顿公司。这项工作做好了，必将有利于改革开放的深入和经济环境、经济秩序的改善；有利于惩治腐败、解决分配不公的问题；有利于提高党和政府的威信和社会的安定。但是，清理整顿公司毕竟是一项十分复杂的工作，它既涉及到政治问题，又涉及到经济问题；既涉及到政策问题，又涉及到法律问题，因此要边清理整顿，边总结经验，使这项工作扎扎实实地进行下去。王荣正同志的来信，从审判实践的角度提出清理整顿公司中的有关法律问题，可供参考。
    从我市清理整顿公司工作情况看，一些公司经营确实混乱，给国家、集体的经济造成很大损失。近年来，因公司所引起的各种经济案件也大量增加，占我院受理经济纠纷案的40—50％，居第一位。同时，从审判中发现一些需要重视的法律问题。
    “升级”、“集资”的背后
    有的个人或合伙主办的公司“升级”为集体，集体的挂上全民的招牌。然后，他们就以集体或全民的招牌签合同、揽生意，收取巨额预付款，或向银行贷款。骗得钱后，以各种手段化为私有，一旦经营亏损，无力偿还债务，便拖、赖，或改名换照另立门户逃避法律追究，使国家、集体、个人的财产和正当权益受到侵害。这类案件往往是双方串通合谋，搞什么联营、购销，逃避银行监督，达到合法取得款项的目的。有家公司以高额利息向铁路系统一个公司借款40万元，为了逃避法律责任，双方以签订购销钢材合同掩人耳目，其实双方都没有钢材，谁也不需要钢材。
    以安排投资者工作、迁入户口、高额利息为诱饵引人上钩。南宁市某公司，参加集资者上万人，集资总额达2000多万元。这样的公司南宁市就有18家。他们在经营上违章，合同履行上失信，债权上争夺，债务上推拖以及个人侵吞公私财物等都十分严重。
    认识要统一　工作要细致
    依照中共中央、国务院关于清理整顿公司的决定，结合上述存在的法律问题，我认为在清理整顿公司工作中要统一认识，树立法制观念。
    工作要细致，手续要完备。清理整顿公司，最主要的是公司所有制性质的确定和从业人员的安置。对原来确定的公司性质，只要符合成立时的规定，手续又完备，工商部门不要再变更整顿前公司的性质，否则在权利享受、义务承担、连带责任即债权债务上引起连锁反应，产生新的法律问题。一个本来是集体性质的公司，它有主管部门，公司注销后依法应由主管部门承担履约义务。如果现在确定改变其为合伙或个人，那么，这个公司注销后的债权债务就由合伙者或个人承担。合伙者或个人是有逃、亡的可能的。从法律上讲，法院便可以因其逃、亡中止或终止审理和执行；而集体或全民性质的公司，一般不存在这个问题。因此，稳定原公司性质对维护对方当事人的合法权益有利。至于从业人员的变动、安置要持慎重态度，否则会引起新的劳务纠纷。
    在清理公司财物时，清点要清楚，要有登记，还要签字署名。物品拍卖时，要组织物价、商业等有关部门论质作价。一般说来，禁止作价人员、清理人员及其亲属留、买，否则会产生新的不清，引起群众的误解或不满，也会引起法律后果。
    在清理债权债务和诉讼中，公司未被注销营业执照的，应以公司名义参加诉讼；已被注销营业执照的属集体或全民性质的公司，应由其主管部门或和清理组一起参加诉讼。清理组不可代替主管部门参加诉讼，但主管部门可独自参加诉讼。现在有些主管部门怕承担法律责任，连权利也放弃了。有些人见公司当前没有偿付能力，就主张“越位”追加主管部门作被告，让主管部门代公司偿付债务。这是不符合法律规定的。至于有些主管部门强调已被注销的下属公司的款、货系原公司的法定代表人、工作人员挪用了，应由挪用人来偿付债务，自己不承担法律责任，这也是法律不允许的。应当明确，在法院没有作出中止或终止审理裁定前，清理整顿的公司都应参加诉讼活动，积极配合法院了结案件。
    清理整顿公司一开始就应建立健全合同档案，也就是每个合同从订立时起就要专袋存放，将所有合同及所有来往函件、收据等都要登记装入或复印抄录登记装入案卷，设专人或兼职专人保管，直至合同履行完毕。这既便于履行人履行，也便于领导部门和监督部门检查，发生纠纷或提起诉讼时能及时提供完整的有利、有力的证据。有内部承包合同的也应建立案卷。
    健全公司的申请承包者、主管部门、批准发证机关三个层次的责任制。当前一些公司经营管理混乱，除了公司工作人员应负责任外，它同主管部门不管不理或很少管很少理，发证部门不深入核查，凭印象、关系、情感发证有密切关系。因此，明确层次责任，建立严格的责任制是十分必要的。还有，在清理整顿公司时，还要留意涉及到与公司来往密切的部门相关联的问题以及相应的对策问题。
