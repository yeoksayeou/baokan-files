Lebanon held a grand funeral for former President Muawad today in his hometown of Zagarta. Approximately 100,000 people attended the ceremony. All shops, schools, banks, and government offices were closed nationwide in mourning for the president, who was killed in a car bomb explosion on November 22.

Meanwhile, Arab countries generally welcomed the election of Elias Hariri as the new president of Lebanon by the Lebanese parliament on November 24.

Egyptian President Mubarak, in a telegram to Hariri, said that the election of a new president shows that the Lebanese people have the ability to face various challenges, overcome obstacles, and continue the process of national reconciliation.

King Hussein of Jordan, in his telegram, said that Hariri's assumption of the heavy responsibility of national reconciliation at a critical time once again shows the Lebanese people's determination to overcome the crisis and heal the wounds of war.

Leaders of Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Bahrain, Kuwait, and the Arab League organization also sent telegrams to Hariri, congratulating him on his election.
