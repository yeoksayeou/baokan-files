After implementing a series of adjustment measures, Jordan's economy, which had been in decline, is gradually recovering.

Jordan's economy has faced severe setbacks in recent years. Since 1982, due to the sharp drop in global oil prices and the stagnation of the Gulf economy, Arab oil-producing countries could no longer provide Jordan with the generous aid they had in the past. The declining remittances from overseas Jordanians further exacerbated the economic difficulties. The agricultural base in the fertile Jordan Valley suffered consecutive frosts, oil resources have not been found, and water remains the most unreliable commodity in the country. All these factors combined have plunged Jordan's economy into a crisis.

Jordan's economy is heavily dependent on the gratuitous aid from Arab oil-producing countries. In 1978, the Baghdad Arab Summit decided that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, and four other oil-producing countries would provide Jordan with $125 million in gratuitous aid annually from 1979 to 1988. However, due to the recent sharp drop in global oil prices leading to economic stagnation in the Gulf region, these seven Arab oil-producing countries have been unable to fulfill their initial promises.

Last July, the Jordanian government announced its separation from the West Bank in terms of administration and law. As a result, many Palestinians rushed to withdraw their deposits, transfer fixed assets, and reduce remittances to Jordan, dealing an unexpected heavy blow to Jordan's economy.

Jordan's total foreign debt has reached $8.3 billion this year, with a per capita debt of $2,800, while its foreign exchange reserves have dropped to a historic low of just $20 million. Furthermore, due to Jordan's long-standing high-consumption lifestyle, 80% of daily necessities are imported, with annual imports costing $3 billion. Jordan's budget deficit this year will account for 22% of its GDP, amounting to 1.22 billion dinars (approximately $1.7 billion).

Jordan's prices have increased by an average of 15% to 30% this year, while purchasing power has decreased by 20%, making life increasingly difficult for the Jordanian people. Per capita income has dropped from $1,800 in 1982 to the current $900.

To alleviate the burden of foreign debt, the Jordanian government has conducted effective negotiations with creditor countries. 62% of Jordan's foreign debt comes from more than 20 Western countries in the Paris Club and London Club. In July, 14 creditor countries in the Paris Club agreed to allow Jordan to defer the repayment of part of its debt due from January this year to June 1991 for five years. In September, the creditor banks in the London Club also approved Jordan's request to defer the repayment of a $75 million debt due in 1991 for five years.

Arab oil-producing countries have also provided significant assistance to Jordan during its most difficult economic times, fulfilling their previous commitments. In July, Saudi Arabia paid Jordan nearly $200 million in promised aid, while the governments of Kuwait and the UAE provided Jordan with $80 million and $70 million in gratuitous aid, respectively.

The International Monetary Fund recently signed an agreement to provide Jordan with a $150 million low-interest loan this year. The governments of Japan and West Germany will also provide Jordan with $150 million and $17 million in preferential loans, respectively.

To stabilize its national currency, the Jordanian government has begun implementing some previously unenforced regulations, such as limiting the amount of foreign exchange that nationals can freely remit abroad, imposing travel taxes, and encouraging savings. The Central Bank of Jordan has the authority to intervene in the foreign exchange market to maintain the stability of the dinar's exchange rate. Facing the public's crisis of confidence in the dinar, the government closed more than 70 foreign exchange markets nationwide.

To reduce the budget and trade deficits, the Jordanian government has adopted a series of new economic measures, including cutting back on construction projects, reducing government expenditures, and banning the import of luxury items such as cars, televisions, and refrigerators. The government has also implemented policies to encourage exports and trade liberalization. The Jordanian government has canceled or eased the issuance of investment permits to encourage private enterprises and establish export trade groups. In the first half of this year, Jordan's imports decreased by 17% compared to the same period last year, while exports increased accordingly. The Jordanian government also plans to revitalize the tourism industry to promote economic development.

### 走出低谷的约旦经济齐前进

    走出低谷的约旦经济齐前进
    在实行了一系列调整措施之后，一度衰退的约旦经济正逐步走出低谷。
    约旦经济近年遭受了严重挫折。1982年以来，由于世界油价暴跌、海湾经济停滞不前，阿拉伯产油国无法再一如往昔对约旦慷慨解囊。直线下降的海外侨民汇款额又使约旦经济更加困难。农副产品基地——富庶的约旦河谷又连年遭受霜冻，石油资源仍未找到，水依然是这个国家最靠不住的商品，这一切加在一起使得约旦经济陷入困境。
    约旦经济在很大程度上依赖阿拉伯产油国的无偿援助。1978年巴格达阿拉伯首脑会议决定，沙特阿拉伯、科威特、阿联酋等7个产油国在1979—1988年间每年向约旦提供12.5亿美元的无偿援助。但由于近年世界油价暴跌导致海湾地区经济萧条，7个阿拉伯产油国无法兑现当初的允诺。
    去年7月，约旦政府宣布同约旦河西岸脱离行政和法律关系后，不少巴勒斯坦人纷纷挤提存款，转移固定资产，减少向约旦汇寄外汇，使约旦经济遭受了意想不到的沉重打击。
    约旦的外债总额今年已达83亿美元，人均2800美元，而外汇储备却降到了历史最低点，仅剩2000万美元。其次，由于约旦多年形成的高消费的生活方式，80％的生活必需品依赖进口，每年进口产品要耗费30亿美元。约旦今年的预算赤字将占国民生产总值的22％，达1.22亿第纳尔（约合1.7亿美元）。
    约旦今年的物价平均比去年上涨15％—30％，而群众购买力则下降了20％，这使得约旦人民生活日益艰难，人均收入由1982年的1800美元下降到目前的900美元。
    为了减轻外债负担，约旦政府同债权国进行了卓有成效的谈判。约旦的外债62％来自于巴黎俱乐部和伦敦俱乐部的20多个西方国家。7月，巴黎俱乐部的14个债权国宣布，允许约旦推迟5年偿还从今年1月到1991年6月之间到期的部分债务。9月，伦敦俱乐部的债权银行也表示，批准约旦推迟5年偿还一项1991年到期的总额为7500万美元的债款。
    阿拉伯产油国在约旦经济最困难的时刻也鼎力相助，履行先前的承诺。沙特7月向约旦支付了允诺的近2亿美元的援款，科威特和阿联酋政府也分别向约旦提供了8000万美元和7000万美元的无偿援助。
    国际货币基金组织最近签订协议，今年向约旦提供1.5亿美元的低息贷款。日本与西德政府也将分别向约旦提供1.5亿美元和1700万美元的优惠贷款。
    为了稳定本国货币，约旦政府开始实施一些以前从未实行的规定，如限定本国人可自由汇到国外的外汇数额，收取旅行税，吸收并鼓励存款。约旦中央银行有权为保持第纳尔汇价稳定干预外汇市场。面对国人对第纳尔的信任危机，政府关闭了全国70多家外汇自由兑换市场。
    为了降低预算与贸易赤字，约旦政府采取了一系列新的经济措施，压缩基建项目，压缩政府开支，禁止进口汽车、电视机、电冰箱等奢侈品；实行鼓励出口和贸易自由化政策。约旦政府取消了投资许可证或放宽了发放条件，以鼓励私营企业和建立出口贸易集团。今年上半年约旦进口比去年同时期减少了17％，而出口额却相应增长。约旦政府还计划通过振兴旅游业来促进经济的发展。
