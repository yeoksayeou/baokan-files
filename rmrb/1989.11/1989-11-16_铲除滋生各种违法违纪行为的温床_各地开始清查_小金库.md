The People's Daily has learned from the State Council's Taxation, Finance, and Price Inspection Office that the work of cleaning up and inspecting "little treasuries" has begun in some regions and units.

In the ongoing nationwide inspection of taxation, finance, and prices, some regions and units have taken the initiative to clean up and inspect the issue of privately set "little treasuries," achieving some initial results. By October, Shanghai had uncovered 1,156 privately set "little treasuries" with a total balance of 26.54 million yuan. By mid-October, Hubei Province and Tianjin Municipality had each uncovered "little treasuries" amounting to over 500 million yuan. The Jinan Railway Bureau had uncovered 601 "little treasuries" totaling 1.39 million yuan. The Shenyang Zhongjie Friendship Factory conducted a cleanup and inspection of the "little treasuries" in its 21 subsidiaries and departments, uncovering a total of 1.76 million yuan. By the end of October, units under the China National Petroleum Corporation had uncovered "little treasuries" amounting to 7.196 million yuan.

A large amount of evidence shows that "little treasuries" are breeding grounds for various illegal and disciplinary violations. Shanghai Ke Li Typing and Duplicating Service is a welfare enterprise with only 11 regular employees. From the beginning of last year to May of this year, it used methods such as falsely reporting the number of employees and embezzling cash to set up a "little treasury" of 32,000 yuan, which was used for banquets and entertainment. By the time it was discovered, only 1,241 yuan remained. The Cultural Exchange Office of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Culture stored 14,000 yuan in donations from relevant parties at a private residence, which was stolen on October 16 this year, prompting a report to the authorities.

A responsible person from the State Council's Taxation, Finance, and Price Inspection Office pointed out: Nationwide, the work of cleaning up and inspecting "little treasuries" has just begun, and the vast majority of units' "little treasuries" have not been touched. After the issuance of the "Notice from the State Council on Cleaning Up and Inspecting 'Little Treasuries'" (see the full text on page 2), all regions, departments, and units should seize the opportunity to extensively carry out and deepen the work of inspecting "little treasuries."

    铲除滋生各种违法违纪行为的温床
    各地开始清查“小金库”
    本报北京11月15日讯　记者从国务院税收、财务、物价大检查办公室了解到，清理和检查“小金库”工作已在一些地区和单位逐步展开。
    在目前正在进行的税收、财务、物价大检查中，一些地区和单位主动清理、检查私设“小金库”问题，初步取得了一些效果。上海市截至10月份已查出私设“小金库”1156个，“小金库”余额2654万元。湖北省和天津市到10月中旬，各查出“小金库”金额500多万元。济南铁路局已查出“小金库”601个，金额139万元。沈阳市中捷友谊厂对所属21个分厂和处室的“小金库”进行了清理和检查，共查出176万元。中国石油天然气总公司所属单位到10月末，已查出“小金库”金额719.6万元。
    大量事实证明，“小金库”是滋生各种违法违纪行为的温床。上海凯利打字誊印社是个仅有正式职工11人的福利企业，从去年初到今年5月，采取虚报职工人数、套取现金等手段，私设“小金库”32000元，用于吃喝宴请，到查获时仅剩1241元。天津市文化局文化交流办公室将有关方面的赠款14000元存放私人家中，今年10月16日被盗，才被迫报案。
    国务院税收、财务、物价大检查办公室负责人指出：从全国来说，清理和检查“小金库”的工作才刚开始起步，绝大部分单位的“小金库”还没有触动。在《国务院关于清理检查“小金库”的通知》（全文见第二版）发布以后，各地区、各部门、各单位要不失时机地把清查“小金库”的工作广泛地开展起来，不断引向深入。
