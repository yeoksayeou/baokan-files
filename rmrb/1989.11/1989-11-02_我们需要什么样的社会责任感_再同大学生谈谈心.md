Over this period, university students, while completing their demanding academic tasks, have been studying the important speeches by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and Comrade Jiang Zemin's National Day speech, combining these with their own thoughts. These speeches are powerful ideological weapons for students to clarify their thoughts, distinguish right from wrong, raise their awareness, and boost their spirits.

After a period of study, many students have made significant progress in their thinking, and their emotions have gradually calmed down. However, some students still have some unresolved issues in their minds. Notably, some students believe they participated in the student movement with a strong sense of social responsibility and patriotism. A very small number of individuals used the student movement to create chaos and even counter-revolutionary riots, with malicious intentions that must be firmly suppressed. However, this is completely different from the intentions of the majority of students. Is it wrong for students to care about national affairs and actively participate in social and political life? Should young students not have a strong sense of social responsibility towards the development of the country? The People's Daily published an editorial titled "New Academic Year Greetings to University Students" on August 24, addressing some of the issues in students' thoughts. Today, we would like to further discuss our views on this issue and exchange ideas with students.

Should young students have a sense of social responsibility and a willingness to participate? On this point, our party's answer has always been affirmative. Youth are the most active and vibrant part of society's forces, bearing the glorious mission of opening up the future, and naturally need to have a strong sense of social responsibility. Would students prefer to be narrow-minded and mediocre, or to be pioneers with great aspirations and a strong sense of social responsibility? This is self-evident. Chairman Mao Zedong once said, "Youth not only do things but should also take the lead..." If young people do not dare to take the lead in anything, or even do not want to do anything, then what hope does our country and nation have? Whether in the revolutionary war years or the peaceful construction period, we have always advocated that young people should have a sense of social responsibility and have supported and encouraged their patriotism. Even if young people, especially young students, have various shortcomings, the party has always fully affirmed their strengths, encouraged young people to join the tide of transforming China, achieve great deeds, and play a role. This was the case in the past and will be the case in the future. On the other hand, we are a socialist country, where "all power belongs to the people." Including university students, all people have the sacred duty and important sign of social progress to participate in the political, economic, and cultural life of society through various legal channels. Students and the masses having patriotism and actively participating in social life is a good thing, indicating that our socialist system is gradually maturing. How could the party and government reject the wishes, opinions, and voices of the people?

On these fundamental issues, our party's policy has been consistent. Even in the process of handling this turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot, we have adhered to these policies towards the majority of students. Although the turmoil escalated, work, life, and social order were seriously disrupted, and even normal state activities were obstructed, the party and government remained extremely restrained and repeatedly stated that the subjective wishes of the majority of students were good, insisting on distinguishing the malicious intentions of a very small number of people from the good wishes of the majority of students. Even some Western political observers had to admit that students' enthusiasm was high, and they bore a large part of the responsibility for this turmoil. However, after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot, the party and government did not hold a grudge against the students. Some students may have said or done wrong things, but as long as they did not violate the law, the leadership would not pursue them, hoping they would educate themselves, recognize their mistakes, and correct them. Moreover, the slogans raised by students, such as "punishing corruption" and "promoting democracy," were used by a very small number of bad people, but the party and government still positively accepted the reasonable parts of students' opinions. Soon after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot, a series of major decisions were made to seriously address these issues. All this shows that the party and government have not denied the patriotism and positive factors of the majority of students because of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot.

However, it must be frankly pointed out that in this turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot, some students indeed lacked a sense of social responsibility. They did not understand what responsibilities a university student should have towards society, acted emotionally, and considered the overall situation of the country and nation too little. Some even had personal motives. Of course, such people are very few. But this incident indeed exposed many weaknesses of the students. If we do not face these problems and learn from them positively, it is also wrong, as it will cause students to make bigger mistakes and fall harder in the future. Therefore, we have the responsibility to help students clarify some ideological issues and help them mature politically.

Youth should place a firm and correct political direction in the first place, which is the political foundation for establishing a sense of social responsibility. The social responsibility we talk about is not an abstract concept but has clear political content. This should at least include the responsibility to safeguard the fundamental interests of the country and the people. Only socialism can save China and develop China. This is a historical conclusion and also the ideological foundation for young people to establish a sense of social responsibility. Stability and unity are the prerequisites for reform and opening up and socialist modernization construction, and are in the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation. Turmoil can only bring disaster to the Chinese nation. If we cannot reach a consensus on these most basic issues, how can we talk about a sense of social responsibility? However, it is precisely on these most fundamental issues that some students have lost their way. When a turmoil approached, they either did not see or completely ignored the malicious intentions of a very small number of people who tried to deny the leadership of the Communist Party, deny the socialist system, and overthrow the people's regime, and enthusiastically joined in, going further and further, even regarding a turmoil that would bury China's future as "revolutionary" actions.

Some students say, "I hope to govern our country well, and with this belief, how can participating in national affairs be wrong?" This view also needs to be clarified. Including students, the people indeed have the right to manage or participate in state affairs, but how should they manage and participate? The Constitution of our country clearly stipulates: "The people, in accordance with the law, through various channels and forms, manage state affairs, manage economic and cultural undertakings, and manage social affairs." There are two points worth noting here: one is "in accordance with the law," and the other is "through various channels and forms." This is the action standard for all participation activities. If laws are ignored and so-called "big democracy" is pursued, what good can such "participation" bring to the country? Managing state affairs requires order; without order, it is not management. Whether government officials, workers, peasants, or students, because of their different roles, the ways and means of managing state affairs cannot be the same. Cultivating a university student or graduate student requires a lot of money from the state and the people. In a situation where our country and people are not rich, this is not easy. Any university student or graduate student with a conscience will not disappoint the expectations of the state and the people's nurturing, strive to become a useful person, and be ready to contribute to the country and repay the people in the future. The main task of students is to study, to prepare for entering society in the future, building the motherland, benefiting the people, gaining knowledge, and increasing skills. Therefore, for students who are studying in school, their sense of social responsibility should first be reflected in completing the learning tasks assigned by the party and the people. Students should care about national and international affairs and real social political problems, but participating in managing state affairs must strictly follow the law and cannot be arbitrary or self-willed. If people want to manage whatever they want to manage and manage however they want to manage, wouldn't they bring chaos to society?

In this incident, many students' motives for getting involved may not have been bad, but why did they end up on the opposite side of their good intentions? The main lesson is that they were detached from reality, lacked understanding of society, national conditions, and the working and peasant masses, as some students themselves said, they committed some political immaturity. China must progress and develop, which is undoubted; but how to progress and develop is both a theoretical issue and a practical issue. China is so large and the situation is so complex that we must start from reality, consider various factors and conditions, choose the right opportunities and steps, and advance step by step. That kind of superficial boasting and arrogant attitude is shallow and harmful. Young intellectuals should take the road of integrating with workers and peasants, which is a correct policy. On this issue, we have made mistakes and will not repeat the "leftist" approach. But from the growth of young intellectuals, this is indeed a correct path. Intellectuals, especially young students, should, through various channels, go deep into the grassroots, deep into society, undergo tempering, and gain experience, which is an effective way to establish a correct sense of social responsibility. In the society, this big classroom, we will learn rich knowledge that cannot be learned from books. The more such knowledge we have, the better we can play our role in the great practice of transforming China.

Recently, Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in a discussion with the Young Communist League cadres: "We should have full enthusiasm and strict requirements for our young generation." This is a completely correct policy. For the shortcomings and some bad ideological tendencies exposed by students in this turmoil, we should not avoid them but dare to face them and gradually solve them. At the same time, the party and league organizations and political work departments in schools should be benevolent and persuasive when helping students solve these problems. Ideological problems can only be solved through patient and detailed ideological and political work, awakening people's consciousness. Even if some students do not understand certain issues for the time being, it doesn't matter. As long as we do patient and detailed ideological work, put the facts on the table, and clarify the right and wrong, benefits and harms, we believe that the vast majority of students will, sooner or later, return to the correct position. Youth pursue truth and believe in facts. University students have hope, youth have hope, and our country's future has hope. We firmly believe this.

### 我们需要什么样的社会责任感——再同大学生谈谈心

    我们需要什么样的社会责任感
    ——再同大学生谈谈心
    这段时间，大学生在完成紧张的学业的同时，都在结合自己的思想实际，认真学习邓小平同志的几次重要讲话和江泽民同志的国庆讲话。这些讲话是同学们清理思想，澄清是非，提高觉悟，振奋精神的强有力的思想武器。
    经过一段时间的学习，很多同学的思想有了一定程度的提高，情绪渐渐缓解下来。但是不少同学思想上还有些“扣子”没有完全解开。其中比较突出的是，一些同学认为自己是怀着强烈的社会责任感和一腔爱国热忱投入学潮的。极少数人利用学潮制造动乱直至反革命暴乱，用心险恶，应该坚决予以打击，但这和广大同学的初衷根本不同。难道同学们关心国家大事，积极参与社会政治生活错了吗？青年学生就不应该对国家的发展抱有强烈的社会责任感吗？8月24日本报曾发表社论《新学年寄语大学生》，就同学们思想上存在的一些问题，谈了我们的看法。今天，我们愿就这个问题进一步谈谈看法，与同学们交换意见。
    青年学生要不要有社会责任感和参与意识？对于这一点，我们党的回答历来是肯定的。青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量，担负着开拓未来的光荣使命，当然需要具有强烈的社会责任感。同学们当目光短浅、胸无大志的庸人好呢，还是当怀抱远大志向和强烈社会责任感的开路先锋好呢？这是不言而喻的。毛泽东同志曾说过：“青年不但做事而且应该打头，……”如果青年干什么事都不敢打头，甚至连事也不想干，那么我们这个国家、这个民族还有什么希望呢？无论在革命战争年代还是和平建设时期，我们从来都是提倡青年要有社会责任感，并爱护和支持青年的爱国热情的。即使青年特别是青年学生身上有这样那样的不足，党也总是充分肯定他们的优点，鼓励青年投身于改造中国的洪流中去，建功立业，发挥作用。过去是这样，今后也是这样。另一方面，我们是社会主义国家，“一切权力属于人民”。包括大学生在内的全体人民依法通过各种途径参与社会的政治、经济、文化生活，是公民的神圣职责，也是社会文明、进步的重要标志。学生和人民群众有爱国热情，积极参与社会生活，是好事，说明我们的社会主义制度逐步走向成熟。党和政府怎么会把人民的愿望、意见和呼声拒之门外呢？
    在这些基本问题上，我们党的方针是一贯的。即使在处置这场动乱和反革命暴乱的过程中，我们对待广大同学仍然坚持了这些方针。尽管动乱逐步升级，工作、生活和社会秩序遭到严重破坏，甚至连正常的国务活动都受到阻碍，党和政府仍然极度克制，并一再申明，广大同学的主观愿望是好的，坚持把极少数人的别有用心同广大同学的善良愿望区别开来。就连一些西方政治观察家也不得不承认，学生们的头脑发热，居高不下，对这场动乱要负很大一部分责任。但是，党和政府在平息反革命暴乱后，并没有迁怒于同学。有些同学说过错话，办过错事，只要没有触犯刑律，领导上也不予追究，希望他们通过自我教育，认识问题，改正错误。不仅如此，同学们提出的“惩治腐败”、“推进民主”等口号曾被极少数坏人所利用，但党和政府还是善意和积极地接受了同学们意见中的合理部分，在平息反革命暴乱之后不久，作出了一系列重大决策，对这些问题加以认真解决。这一切都说明，党和政府对广大同学的爱国热忱和积极因素并没有因为发生动乱和反革命暴乱而予以否定。
    但是，也应该坦率地指出，在这场动乱和反革命暴乱中，确有一些同学是缺乏社会责任感的。他们不懂得一个大学生对社会应有什么责任，感情用事，对国家和民族的大局考虑得太少。有的人甚至怀有某种个人目的。当然，这样的人是极少极少的。但这场风波确实暴露出同学们的不少弱点，不正视这些问题，不从积极的方面吸取教训，也是不对的，这会使同学们将来犯更大的错误，跌更大的跟头。因此，我们有责任帮助同学们澄清一些思想是非，使他们在政治上更快地成熟起来。
    青年应该把坚定正确的政治方向放在第一位，这是建立社会责任感的政治基础。我们所说的社会责任感不是抽象的概念，而是有明确政治内容的。这至少应包括维护国家和人民的根本利益的责任感。只有社会主义才能救中国，才能发展中国。这是历史的结论，同时也是青年树立社会责任感的思想基础。安定团结是改革开放和社会主义现代化建设的前提，是中华民族的根本利益所在。动乱只能给中华民族带来灾难。如果我们在这些最简单的问题上都达不到共识，那么怎么谈得上社会责任感呢？但是，恰恰在这些最根本的问题上，一些同学迷失了方向。他们在一场动乱来临的时候，看不到或者完全忽视了极少数坏人妄图否定共产党领导，否定社会主义制度，颠覆人民政权的险恶用心，狂热地卷入其间，越走越远，甚至把一场要葬送中国前途的动乱，看成是“革命”的行动。
    有的同学说，我是希望把我们国家治理得好，抱着这样的信念参与国家大事怎么会错？这个看法也需要澄清。包括学生在内的人民群众确实有管理或参与国家事务的权利，但应当怎样管理、怎样参与呢？我国宪法明确规定：“人民依照法律规定，通过各种途径和形式，管理国家事务，管理经济和文化事业，管理社会事务。”这里有两点值得注意：一是“依照法律规定”，一是“通过各种途径和形式”。这是一切参与活动的行动准则。如果置法律于不顾，搞所谓“大民主”，这样的“参与”能给国家带来什么好处呢？管理国家事务要有秩序，没有秩序就不成其为管理。政府官员也好，工人也好，农民也好，学生也好，因为角色的不同，管理国家事务的途径和方式不可能是一样的。培养一名大学生、研究生，国家和人民要花很多钱，在我们国家和人民都不富裕的情况下，是很不容易的。任何一个有良心的大学生、研究生，决不会辜负国家期望之情，人民养育之恩，努力使自己成为有用之材，以便将来报效国家，报答人民。学生的任务主要是学习，是为将来走向社会，建设祖国、造福人民，长知识、增才干。所以对在校学习的同学来说，社会责任感首先应当表现在完成好党和人民交给的学习任务上。对国家大事、世界大事应当关心，对现实社会政治问题应当关心，但是参与管理国家事务必须严格依照法律办事，不能随心所欲，自行其是。如果人们想管什么事就管什么事，想怎么管就怎么管，岂不是把社会搞乱了吗？
    在这场风波中，很多同学卷入其中的动机也许并不坏，但为什么会走到善良愿望的反面？主要的教训就是，脱离实际，缺乏对社会、对国情、对工农群众的了解，正如有些同学自己所说的，在政治上犯了某种幼稚病。中国要进步，要发展，这是毫无疑问的；但怎样进步和发展，既是个理论问题，更是个实践问题。中国这么大，情况这么复杂，必须从实际出发，考虑各种因素和条件，选择恰当的时机和步骤，一步一个脚印地前进。那种浮华的夸夸其谈和自以为是的傲慢态度，是浅薄的，更是有害的。青年知识分子要走与工农相结合的道路，这个方针是对的。在这个问题上我们有过失误，不会重复“左”的一套作法。但从青年知识分子的成长来看，这确是一条正确的道路。知识分子尤其是青年学生，通过各种途径，深入基层，深入社会，经受锻炼，增加阅历，是树立正确的社会责任感的有效途径。在社会这个大课堂，我们会学到书本上学不到的丰富的知识。这样的知识越多，我们就越能在改造中国的伟大实践中发挥才干。
    不久前，江泽民同志在同共青团干部座谈时指出：“对我们的青年一代既要满腔热情，又要严格要求。”这是个完全正确的方针。对同学们在这场动乱中暴露出来的一些缺点和一些不好的思想苗头，我们不能回避，应当敢于正视，并逐步解决。同时，学校的党团组织和政工部门在帮助同学们解决这些问题时，又要与人为善，循循诱导。思想问题只能靠耐心细致的思想政治工作、启发人们的觉悟来解决。即使有些同学对某些问题一时还想不通，也没关系，只要我们善于做细致耐心的思想工作，把事实真相摆出来，把是非、利害讲清楚，相信绝大多数同学或早或迟会回到正确的立场上来。青年是追求真理、相信事实的。大学生有希望，青年有希望，我们国家的未来有希望。对此，我们深信不疑。
