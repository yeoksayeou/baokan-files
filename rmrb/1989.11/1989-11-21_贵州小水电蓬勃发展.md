The rapid development of small hydropower stations in rural areas has significantly promoted the economic development of impoverished and backward rural areas in Guizhou. According to data from the provincial water and electricity bureau, Guizhou, which had no hydropower 33 years ago, now has 2,343 small hydropower stations in rural areas, with a total installed capacity of 432,000 kilowatts and an annual power generation of 886 million kilowatt-hours. About 70% of the townships have access to electricity.

The rapid development of small hydropower has significantly promoted the economic development of rural areas in Guizhou, accelerating the pace of poverty alleviation in impoverished rural areas. In 1978, the total industrial output value of township enterprises in the entire province was only 190 million yuan, while in 1988 alone, it reached 3.4 billion yuan.

　　贵州小水电蓬勃发展
    本报贵阳11月20日电　记者潘帝都报道：蓬勃兴起的农村小水电有力地促进了贫困落后的贵州农村经济的发展。据省水电厅提供的数据，33年前水电还是空白的贵州农村，如今已有小水电站2343座，总装机容量43.2万千瓦，年发电量8.86亿度，有70％的乡用上了电。
    小水电的蓬勃兴起，有力地促进了贵州农村经济的发展，加快了贫困农村脱贫的步伐。1978年时全省乡镇企业总产值仅1.9亿元，1988年一年即达34亿元。
