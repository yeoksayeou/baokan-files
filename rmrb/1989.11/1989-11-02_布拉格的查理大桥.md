Among the many cities in Europe, Prague is an ancient and picturesque city with numerous bridges. Standing on the ancient city walls of Vysehrad Hill and looking down at the surging Vltava River, 18 bridges stretch across the river like rainbows, embracing the swift-flowing water and connecting the Gothic and Baroque architecture on both banks.

Among these bridges, the most famous is the Charles Bridge. It is the first bridge built by the people of Prague across the Vltava River and has a history of over 600 years. At both ends of the Charles Bridge stand Gothic-style bridge towers, majestic and harmonious. Along both sides of the bridge, every 20 meters or so, there are statues and groups of sculptures, totaling 30. There are stone figures, stone beasts, and also mythical creatures with human faces and animal bodies or vice versa, all vividly lifelike. Most of these sculptures are based on biblical stories and folk legends. Due to natural erosion and the ravages of war, very few of the original statues have been preserved, and most are replicas.

This bridge was constructed during the reign of Charles IV, the most prosperous period in the history of Czechoslovakia. The bridge is 516 meters long and 9.4 meters wide, built entirely of stone without a single nail or piece of wood. Standing on this bridge that has weathered the ages, one cannot help but admire the wisdom and outstanding bridge-building skills of the ancient Czech laborers. After its completion, the people of Prague always referred to this bridge as the Prague Bridge or Stone Bridge. In 1870, it was officially named the Charles Bridge by the government to honor and commemorate Charles IV, the king who decided to build the bridge. Over the centuries, the bridge has shared the fortunes and misfortunes of the people of Prague. It has been submerged by the river and trampled by the iron hooves of invaders. It also records the glorious deeds of the Czech people fighting against foreign invaders on the bridge.

With the passage of time, the Charles Bridge has undergone many changes. In 1723, oil lamps were first installed on the bridge. In 1883, the first electric tram crossed the Charles Bridge. Now, the ancient lampposts are equipped with modern high-pressure sodium lamps, and all vehicles are prohibited from driving on the bridge. To protect this bridge, the Czech government allocated special funds for comprehensive repairs in 1965, which took over nine years. According to experts, after the repairs, the bridge can be preserved for at least another 1000 years. Now, the Charles Bridge has become the most important tourist attraction in Prague. Year-round, the bridge is bustling with visitors, and every year, millions of tourists from around the world leave their footprints here.

    布拉格的查理大桥
    孙希有
    在欧洲众多的城市中，布拉格是一个古色古香，山青水秀的多桥之城。
    登上维谢赫拉特山古老的城墙遗址，向山下奔腾的伏尔塔瓦河眺望，18座大桥如虹如练，拥抱着滔滔北上的河水，将河两岸的歌特式、巴洛克式建筑连成一体。
    在众多的桥梁中，最负盛名的是查理大桥。它是布拉格人在伏尔塔瓦河上修建的第一座桥梁，距今已有600余年的历史。查理大桥的两端耸立着歌特式桥楼，气势宏伟而又相称。桥栏两侧每隔20余米都相对立有雕像和群塑像，共30座。有石人、石兽，也有人们杜撰出来的兽面人身或兽身人面像，个个栩栩如生。这些雕塑大多取材于圣经和民间传说。由于大自然的侵蚀和战争的浩劫，这些雕像的原件保存下来的已经很少，大部分是复制品。
    这座桥兴建于捷克斯洛伐克历史上最昌盛的查理四世国王时期。桥全长516米，宽为9.4米，没用一钉一木，全部用石头砌成。站在这饱经沧桑的大桥上，你不能不对捷古代劳动人民的聪明才智和卓越的建桥艺术表示钦佩。大桥落成后，布拉格人一直把这座桥称为布拉格桥或石桥，1870年官方正式命名为查理大桥，以示对决定建桥的查理四世国王的尊敬和纪念。数百年来，这座桥同布拉格人共命运同患难。它曾被河水淹没，也曾遭受侵略者的铁蹄践踏。它也记载着捷人民同外国侵略者在大桥上激战的光荣业迹。
    随着历史的变迁，查理大桥也不断发生变化。1723年，桥上首次安装上点油路灯。1883年，第一辆电车驶过查理大桥。现在，古老的灯杆上安装的是新式高压钠灯，桥上已禁止一切车辆行驶。为保护这座大桥，捷政府1965年拨专款全面维修，历时9年多。据有关专家介绍，经过维修后的大桥至少还可以保存1000年。现在，查理大桥已经成为布拉格最重要的游览点。查理桥上，一年四季游人如织，每年都有来自世界各地的上千万名游客留下自己的踪迹。
