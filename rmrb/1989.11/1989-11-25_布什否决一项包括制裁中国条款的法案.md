Bush Vetoes a Bill Including Sanctions Against China

    Our reporter in Washington, November 23rd - President Bush, due to disagreements with Congress on a certain clause, vetoed the "Department of State Authorization Act" and its amendments passed by Congress yesterday. The so-called amendments to sanction China included in it were also vetoed.

    Since our country suppressed the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, the U.S. side has rudely interfered in China's internal affairs and taken sanctions against China. Following the passage of sanctions against China by the House and Senate on June 29th and July 14th respectively, Congress, disregarding China's solemn protests, continued to create new obstacles for Sino-U.S. relations. On November 15th and 16th, the House and Senate respectively passed the "Department of State Authorization Act" and its amendments, once again inserting sanctions against China into the bill, listing U.S. sanctions against China in the bill.

    After this omnibus bill was passed, a dispute arose between the White House and Congress. The Bush administration rejected a clause in the bill (which prohibits the government from using U.S. aid funds to support foreign countries in implementing policies that violate U.S. laws), believing that this clause "will restrict the actions of U.S. foreign policy." The House therefore withdrew this clause, but the clause in the Senate remained controversial and was not decided. On the night of the 21st, Bush vetoed the "Department of State Authorization Act" and its amendments due to this clause, and the sanctions against China included in it were also vetoed and shelved. Congress adjourned on the eve of Thanksgiving on November 23rd and will resume formal work on January 23rd next year.

    How Congress will act next remains to be seen.

### 布什否决一项包括制裁中国条款的法案

　　布什否决一项包括制裁中国条款的法案
    本报华盛顿11月23日电　布什总统因与国会在某一条款上意见不一，昨日否决了国会通过的“国务院授权法”及其修正案，其中包含的所谓对华制裁修正案因而也一起被否决。
    自从我国平息北京的反革命暴乱以后，美国方面粗暴干涉中国内政，采取了对华制裁措施。继6月29日和7月14日众参两院分别通过制裁中国的修正案后，国会两院不顾中国方面的严正抗议，继续给中美关系设置新的障碍，在11月15日和16日众参两院分别通过的“国务院授权法”及其修正案中，又一次塞进了对华制裁修正案，把美国采取的制裁措施列入法案。
    在这个一揽子法案通过后，白宫与国会发生了争执。布什政府对法案中的一项条款
  （即禁止政府使用美国援助款项支持外国执行与美国法律相违的政策）表示不接受，认为这一条款“将会限制美国外交政策的行动”。众院因此撤消了这一条款，但这一条款在参院中因仍争议不休而未作出决定。21日深夜布什则因这一条款否决了“国务院授权法”及其修正案，包含在其中的对华制裁修正案也被否决搁置。国会两院已于11月23日感恩节前夕休会，直到明年1月23日恢复正式工作。
    国会将如何动作，仍为人们注目。
