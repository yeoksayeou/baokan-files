Being seen as a high-consumption item, the production of pull-tab cans has been effectively controlled this year due to the strict implementation of the state's restriction policies, and there has been a good start in exporting products and replacing imports.

It is understood that China's annual production capacity for pull-tab cans has reached 2.4 billion units. However, this year's planned production is 1.4 billion units, which is 24% lower than last year's market circulation volume. From the execution situation, only 547 million units were produced in the first nine months of this year, and it is estimated that by the end of the year, the production will reach 600 million units, less than half of the annual plan. The circulation volume of pull-tab cans in the market has also significantly decreased compared to last year, and it is estimated that the annual circulation volume will be reduced by about 500 million units compared to last year.

Why has the production and consumption of pull-tab cans in China been effectively controlled? According to the person in charge of the China Packaging Corporation, the main reasons are twofold: First, the series of administrative and economic measures taken by the state to restrict production and consumption have taken effect; second, the anti-corruption and clean governance measures taken by the State Council have produced good results.

It is revealed by relevant departments that the pull-tab can industry has encountered another problem worth noting: while the domestic production of pull-tab cans has been effectively controlled, the import of pull-tab cans has not been effectively stopped. According to incomplete statistics, 580 million empty cans were imported in the first half of the year, and another 248 million units of import contracts were signed in the second half of the year. The total import volume for the year is expected to be more than 2 billion units, which is more than 200 million units than the total domestic production of pull-tab cans this year.

### 国家限制政策见效  “易拉罐热”降温

    国家限制政策见效
    “易拉罐热”降温
    据新华社北京11月13日电  （记者徐耀中）被视为高消费的易拉罐，由于认真贯彻国家的限制政策，今年以来生产得到了有效的控制，并出现了产品出口和替代进口的良好开端。
    据了解，我国易拉罐的年产能力已达24亿只，而今年计划安排的产量为14亿多只，比去年市场流通量低24％。从执行的情况看，今年头9个月仅生产5.47亿只，预计到年底可达6亿只，不到年计划的一半。市场上易拉罐的流通量也明显低于去年，预计全年将比去年减少5亿只左右。
    我国易拉罐的生产和消费为什么能得到有效控制？据中国包装总公司负责人分析，主要原因有二：一是国家采取的一系列限制生产和消费的行政和经济手段收到效果；二是国务院惩治腐败和廉政措施产生了良好的影响。
    据有关部门透露，目前易拉罐行业又出现了一个值得注意的问题：国内易拉罐生产得到了有效控制，但进口易拉罐却禁而不止。据不完全统计，上半年已进口空罐5.8亿只，下半年又签定了2.48亿只的进口合同，全年的进口数量，比今年全年国产易拉罐产量还多2亿多只。
