Zhou Xiu Ling is a teacher at Shai Jialing Primary School in Zhenzi Town, Luan County, Tangshan City, Hebei Province. Her students are all local children, and not a single one has dropped out. Moreover, their average scores have consistently ranked first in the entire district.

In the autumn of 1987, Li Yuanli, a student, was bedridden due to bone tuberculosis. Despite her fatigue, Zhou Xiu Ling went to her home every day to teach. When Yuanli went to Beijing for treatment, the teacher asked her to mail her homework and any difficult problems from Beijing. Zhou Xiu Ling would then correct the homework, solve the problems, and send new exercises from the small village to Beijing, continuing this until just before the entrance exams when Yuanli returned home. The teacher pushed her into the exam room in a wheelchair, and she was admitted to a key middle school with the highest score.

Zhang Huibin lost his mother in childhood, and his father worked in Henan Province. Without proper care and guidance, he became domineering and mischievous. He would come and go as he pleased during classes, indifferent to any advice, criticism, scolding, or ridicule. After Zhou Xiu Ling took over his class, she rarely lectured him; even when she did, it was softly and briefly. She knew that he had been criticized too much, and any well-intentioned criticism would only provoke his resentment. She wanted him to feel genuine warmth and care, to see how to be a good person. When the school collected fees, she paid for him; when his clothes were torn, she mended them; during the busy farming season, she led the whole class to help his family with planting and harvesting. Sometimes, if he didn't come to study, she would gently bring him from home. Week after week, month after month, her sincerity moved him. Zhang Huibin changed. He was elected as the "Labor Commissioner," his grades improved daily, and he eventually entered middle school with excellent results.

When Zhou Xiu Ling took over a new class, Zhou Fulai had the lowest scores. She observed him carefully. One day, she noticed that his pupils seemed slightly larger than others, and she immediately thought of his habit of rubbing his eyes. Could he have an eye problem? When asked, he said that the characters on the blackboard appeared double, then blurred, and then his head would hurt; he could only listen without looking. No wonder he had the most mistakes. Because of his poor grades, this child dared not tell his parents that he couldn't see clearly. His parents, busy with farm work, would never have thought of this. Under Zhou Xiu Ling's insistence and explanation, Xiao Fulai got glasses, truly seeing clearly!

Zhou Xiu Ling is strict yet kind to her students, but she is only strict with herself. She is indifferent to worldly pursuits but enriches herself through further education. While her class's scores have been first in the district for five consecutive years, she has also obtained a middle school teacher's qualification. The improvement in her teaching quality naturally reflects on her students: in the 1987 and 1988 provincial and municipal mathematics competitions, this ordinary mountain village teacher's class had two students win three awards.

　　精诚所至　金石为开
　　——介绍唐山市滦县教师周秀玲
　　唐向荣
    周秀玲是河北省唐山市滦县榛子镇晒甲岭小学老师，她教的学生是本村土生土长的孩子们，不仅没有一个流失，而且平均成绩一直名列全区第一。
    一九八七年秋，李媛莉同学因患骨髓炎而卧床，周老师不顾劳累，天天去她家讲课。媛莉去北京住院时，老师让她从北京寄回作业和疑难问题，然后再把批改后的作业、难题解答和习题从小山村寄往北京，直到升学考试之前她出院回家。老师用小车推着她进了考场，她呢，以总分第一名的成绩被重点中学录取。
    张会滨童年丧母，父亲在河南省工作。他得不到应有的爱抚与引导，又在弟妹面前说一不二，因此养成了“淘气兼霸气”的性情。上课想来就来，想走就走，规劝、批评、训斥、挖苦，一切无所谓。周秀玲接教他所在的班级之后，对他却很少讲什么；即使讲，也轻声细语，点到即止。因为她知道：他受的批评太多了，再好心的批评也只能引起反感。她要让他感受到切实的温暖和关怀，让他看到该怎么做人。学校收费，她为他交了；衣服弄破，她为他补了；农忙一到，她带全班给他家间苗、收秋。有时他不来上自习，她就温和地从家里把他接来。一周、两周，一月、两月，精诚所至，金石为开，张会滨变了。他被选为“劳动委员”，功课日进，终以优秀成绩升入中学。
    周老师接教新班时，成绩最低的是周福利。她注意观察他。一天，她觉得他的瞳孔似乎比别人略大些，立即联想到他爱揉眼睛，莫不是有眼病？一问，他说看黑板的字都是“双的”，再看就模糊了，再看就头疼了；只好光听不看。怪不得他的错字最多。因为成绩差，这孩子竟不敢向父母说一声自己看不清。父母忙于农活又怎么会想到这一层呢？在周老师督促解释之下，小福利配上了眼镜，真所谓“眼明心亮”啊！年初全县有一次抽测，他破天荒得了九十点五分！
    周秀玲对学生严而又慈，对自己却只剩了个“严”字。她对世俗的追求淡然处之，却通过进修，充实自己。在她的班级的成绩连续五年荣获区里第一的同时，她自己也取得中师学历。教师素质的提高，自然又反映到学生身上：一九八七和一九八八两年省市数学比赛中，这个普普通通的山村老师教的班里，居然也有两人三次受奖。
