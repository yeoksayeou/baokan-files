The 1989 International Maritime Technology Academic Conference and Exhibition opened this morning at the Shanghai Exhibition Center. More than 800 maritime and shipbuilding professionals from 20 countries and regions attended the conference. Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji delivered a speech and cut the ribbon for the exhibition at the opening ceremony.

This maritime conference, themed "Mastering New Maritime Technologies and Improving Marine Logistics," deviates from the previous focus on pure technology (hardware) and emphasizes strategic soft science topics at the macro level. Representatives submitted 48 papers, including 15 from foreign participants. A total of 113 foreign companies participated in the exhibition. The "China Pavilion," organized by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, is the largest pavilion in the history of the exhibition, with 60 exhibitors and over 900 exhibits.

Reports and exhibitions indicate that China's shipbuilding industry has followed a path of "exporting, importing, improving, and re-exporting." Currently, China's overall shipbuilding level has reached the international standard of the early 1980s.

　　国际海事会议在沪举行
    本报上海11月28日电　记者萧关根报道：1989年国际海事技术学术会议和展览会，今天上午在上海展览中心开幕。来自20个国家和地区的800多位航运界、造船界人士参加会议。上海市市长朱熔基在开幕式上致词并为展览会剪彩。
    这次海事会议以“驾驭海事新技术、改进海上贸易的后勤工作”为学术讨论的主题，改变了历届会议以纯技术（硬件）为主的状况，着重在宏观方面进行战略性软科学课题的探讨。代表们提交了48篇论文，其中外方15篇。有113家外商参加这次展览。由中船总公司组织的“中国馆”为历届展览会最大的馆，参展单位60家，展品900多项。
    有关报告和展览表明，中国的造船工业已走出了一条“出口—引进—提高—再出口”的路子。目前，我国造船总体水平已达到80年代初的国际水平。
