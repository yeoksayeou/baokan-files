The leaders of the Soviet Union and Poland today expressed serious concern over the increasingly active revanchist sentiments due to recent events in East Germany, believing that if not stopped, they could lead some people to undermine the post-war borders of Europe.

According to TASS, Soviet leader Gorbachev today met with the Polish government's Prime Minister Mazowiecki, who is on an official visit here.

Gorbachev said that developing friendly relations with Poland is one of the long-term strategic policies of the Soviet Union's foreign policy. He said that although there may be differences in views, different life experiences, and different worldviews and political goals, both the Soviet Union and Poland are concerned about good relations with their neighbors, which lays the foundation for mutual understanding on a wide range of issues. Mazowiecki reiterated Poland's concern for developing multi-faceted cooperation between Poland and the Soviet Union.

When discussing the international situation, both sides agreed that the positive political process in Europe is moving forward, but it is important to organically combine the great changes taking place in Eastern Europe and even the entire European continent with the maintenance of necessary stability. Destroying this stability will set Europe far back.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 25 (Reporter Zhū Chéngjūn) Polish Prime Minister Mazowiecki said at a press conference in Moscow on the 25th that his official visit to the Soviet Union this time was an unusual visit, and the greatest achievement of the visit was mutual understanding between Poland and the Soviet Union.

	He said that the talks with the Soviet side were conducted in an atmosphere of "sincerity, goodwill, and pragmatism." Soviet leader Gorbachev expressed great understanding of Poland's needs during the meeting.

	When asked how to evaluate the Soviet-Polish alliance and the role of the Warsaw Pact, Mazowiecki reiterated that the government he leads will adhere to all treaties and maintain the alliance, especially Poland's obligations to the Warsaw Pact. He pointed out that the new government's attention to Soviet-Polish relations will not be less than that of the previous government. At the same time, he hopes that under new conditions, the relationship between Poland and the Soviet Union should be established on a broader social basis. He also agreed that the political nature of the Warsaw Pact should be increasingly enhanced.

　　波兰总理访问苏联
　　戈尔巴乔夫会见马佐维耶茨基总理
    据新华社莫斯科11月24日电　苏波两国领导人今天对由于民主德国最近发生的事件而愈益活跃的复仇主义情绪表示严重关切，认为如不加以制止，可能会促使某些人破坏战后欧洲的边界。
    据塔斯社报道，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫今天会见了正在这里进行正式访问的波兰政府总理马佐维耶茨基。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，同波兰发展睦邻关系是苏联对外政策长久战略方针之一。他说，双方观点可能有分歧，生活经验互不相同，世界观和政治目标也不一样，但苏波都关心同邻国的良好关系，这为就广泛问题取得相互谅解奠定了基础。马佐维耶茨基重申波兰关心发展波苏之间的多方面合作。
    谈到国际形势时，双方认为，在欧洲积极的政治进程正向前发展，但重要的是使东欧乃至整个欧洲大陆正在发生的巨大变革同保持必要的稳定有机地结合起来，破坏这种稳定将把欧洲远远地抛在后面。
    新华社莫斯科11月25日电（记者竺承军）波兰政府总理马佐维耶茨基25日在莫斯科举行的记者招待会上，把他这次对苏联的正式访问称为是不寻常的访问，认为访问中取得的最大成果是波苏之间有了相互理解。
    他说，同苏方的会谈是在“真诚、善意和求实”的气氛中进行的。苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫在会晤中对波兰的需要表示了极大的理解。
    在被问及如何评价苏波联盟关系和华约作用时，马佐维耶茨基再次重申他领导的政府将遵守一切条约和保持联盟关系，特别是波兰对华约承担的义务。他指出，新政府对波苏关系的重视将不亚于过去的政府。同时他希望在新的条件下，波苏之间的关系应建立在更为广泛的社会基础之上。他还赞成应愈益增加华约的政治性质。
