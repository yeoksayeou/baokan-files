The Construction Bank of Jinan actively assists the tax authorities in their work, handling over 41,000 transactions in the past three years and collecting a total of 56.75 million yuan in construction tax, construction business tax, and urban maintenance and construction tax.

Construction companies, especially collective and private enterprises from rural areas that have moved into the city, are highly mobile and have unstable teams. Additionally, their financial management is often weak, and their accounting practices are irregular, providing opportunities for some unscrupulous enterprises to evade taxes. The Construction Bank is responsible for the financial management of construction companies and construction units, and their economic interactions cannot do without the bank's supervision. Since October 1986, the Jinan branch of the Construction Bank has taken the initiative to handle the collection of the "three taxes" on behalf of the tax authorities.

The method for collecting the "three taxes" is as follows: The Construction Bank deducts the taxes directly from the construction unit's self-raised construction funds and the payments to construction companies according to the tax rates specified by higher authorities, and then transfers the funds to the local treasury. This not only simplifies the procedures and reduces the workload of the tax authorities but also increases the collection rate of the "three taxes."

    发挥自身优势　维护国家税收
    济南建行代征建筑“三税”
    本报济南11月2日电　建设银行济南市分行积极协助税务部门做好税收工作，三年来共办理业务4.1万余笔，累计代征代收建筑税、建筑营业税和城市维护建设税5675万元。
    施工企业，尤其是从农村涌入城市的集体和私营施工企业，因其流动性大，队伍不稳定，加之财务制度不健全，帐目管理不规则，给一些不法企业偷漏税款造成可乘之机。建设银行肩负着对施工企业和建设单位的财务管理，二者之间的经济交往，都离不开建设银行的监督。从1986年10月起，该市建行主动承担起为税务部门代征代收建筑“三税”的业务。
    建筑“三税”的征收办法是：建设银行在收存建设单位自筹基建款和支付施工企业工程款时，按上级规定的税率标准直接扣除，尔后划转解缴当地金库。这样，不仅简化了手续，减轻了税务部门的工作量，而且提高了“三税”的征收率。　（贾建舟　冯新华）
