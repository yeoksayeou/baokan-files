When the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee was implemented, he served as the manager; after the system of full responsibility by the factory director was implemented, he became the Party committee secretary. It was precisely in this period, which some people considered as "missing both ends," that Communist Party member Yuan Ruixin never forgot his duty as a Party member! As a manager, he was a good leader for the Tanggang people; as the Party committee secretary, he was a respected leader for the leadership team and the broad masses of workers. People praised him as a conscientious Communist Party member.

Yuan Ruixin joined Tangshan Iron and Steel Company in 1951 and spent most of his time working in technical and administrative management. In July 1985, when the upper-level leadership adjusted the Tanggang leadership team, he was transferred from the company manager to the Party committee secretary, and it was at this time that Tanggang implemented the director responsibility system. Despite this significant change in his role, Yuan Ruixin did not feel any sense of loss. Instead, he quickly set clear standards for himself from the perspective of the Party's interests.

After taking on the role of secretary, Yuan Ruixin actively supported the work of the director, creating conditions for the director to exercise his authority boldly. He led by example in respecting and maintaining the director's authority, proactively helping the director solve problems, and ensuring the realization of the company's goals.

In 1986, after the State Council approved the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" for the expansion and renovation of Tanggang, there were differing opinions on simultaneously undertaking large-scale construction projects, making it difficult for the director to make decisions. Yuan Ruixin conducted thorough investigations and listened to the opinions of various levels and sectors. After unifying the opinions of leaders at various levels, he used meetings and lectures to unify the understanding of the workers, strengthening their confidence in ensuring the implementation of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan."

To ensure the timely implementation of the expansion and renovation plan, which was crucial to Tanggang's development, Yuan Ruixin, at the request of Director Tian Xien, took on the responsibility of managing the production and operations of the old area while shouldering the leadership of the Party committee. This allowed the director to focus on the key construction projects. After three years of hard work, by the National Day in this year, Tanggang's "Seventh Five-Year Plan" for expansion and renovation was completed a year ahead of schedule. All key construction projects were completed and put into production or trial production. The old area's production and operations also secured the title of the top tax-paying unit in Hebei Province for four consecutive years, achieving a tax revenue of 3.56 billion yuan in 1988, more than doubling the 1985 figure. For these achievements, Tanggang was awarded the "May Day Labor Medal" by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Yuan Ruixin was unanimously recommended by the Party and government to be named as a 1988 Hebei Province Labor Model.

In fulfilling his duties as the Party committee secretary and strengthening the Party's organizational building, Yuan Ruixin immediately focused on educating and training Party members after taking office, ensuring the healthy development of Tanggang's Party organizations at various levels and achieving significant results in Party building work.

In response to the negative attitudes that some Party affairs workers had during the transition period of the Party organization's functions, he led the writing of articles and organized large-scale seminars, publishing articles in Party newspapers and journals at various levels. In specialized training classes for Party affairs cadres at various levels, he shared his personal experiences from the period of "factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee" and emphasized the importance of strengthening ideological and political work.

Due to the unified thinking, the company and its various direct subordinates completed the organizational reforms smoothly, ensuring that the Party committee focused its main efforts on strengthening the Party's own building. During this period, he also emphasized the rectification of Party discipline and anti-corruption within the Party, establishing measures and norms for a clean and upright leadership team, ensuring the fighting spirit and cohesion of Tanggang's Party members. Currently, among the various advanced individuals at Tanggang, Party members account for more than 90%. Tanggang has been named an "Advanced Grassroots Party Organization" by the provincial and municipal committees. In early this year, Tanggang was jointly named a "National Advanced Enterprise in Ideological and Political Work" by the Central Propaganda Department and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

Yuan Ruixin firmly believes that actions speak louder than words and that integrity and self-discipline can lead to a powerful and cohesive team. Therefore, he adheres to four principles of not being special: first, politically, he insists on participating in the organizational life of his branch and accepting democratic evaluations and assessments from the Party small group; second, in life, he insists on queuing in the cafeteria like other workers and has been riding a bicycle to work for many years; third, in terms of treatment, he insists on taking the average bonus of the workers, lowering the bonus standard set by higher authorities, and has twice declined the special bonuses named by the provincial government for the main members of the leadership team; fourth, in terms of family and relatives, he has repeatedly declined promotions and transfers for his relatives, insisting that they continue to work in their original positions.

It is precisely due to the influence of Yuan Ruixin and the Party committee that Tanggang has achieved great successes in Party building and economic development.

Before the National Day this year, he was honored by the Central Organization Department as a "National Outstanding Party Affairs Worker," receiving the highest honor from the Party and the people, and as the only representative from Tangshan City, he attended the "National Advanced Grassroots Party Organizations and Outstanding Party Affairs Workers" commendation conference in Beijing.

　　优秀党务工作者袁瑞新
　　陈仕芳
    实行党委领导下的厂长负责制时，他当经理；在实行厂长全面负责后，他又当了党委书记，正是在这被人认为“两头没赶上”的情况下，共产党员袁瑞新一刻也不忘履行一个共产党员的职责！——当经理他是唐钢人的好“头羊”，当公司党委书记他是班子和广大职工拥戴的好领班！人们称赞他是一个尽职尽责的共产党员。
    袁瑞新同志1951年到唐山钢铁公司工作，大部分时间从事技术和行政管理工作。1985年7月，上级调整唐钢领导班子时，他由公司经理改任了党委书记，而就在此时，唐钢实行了经理负责制。在这职能大转换期改任的袁瑞新，没有丝毫的失落感，而是从党的利益的高度，迅速为自己修定了明确的到位标准。
    袁瑞新同志改任书记后，担任经理的田锡恩同志是袁瑞新担任经理时的助理。能否处理好两者的关系，不仅关系到班子能否团结，而且也关系和影响着整个职工队伍的士气。为此袁瑞新积极支持经理工作，为经理大胆行使职权创造条件，带头尊重和维护经理的权威，主动为经理排忧解难，确保企业奋斗目标的实现。
    1986年，经国务院批准的唐钢“七五”改扩建总体规划开始实施后，对同时搞大规模的建设项目，意见不统一，经理一时难于拍板。对此袁瑞新同志经过充分调查摸底，广泛听取各层各界的意见，在首先统一了各级领导的意见后，又通过会议、宣讲等形式，统一职工的认识，坚定了确保“七五”规划总体实现的信心。
    为了保证事关唐钢发展的改扩建总体规划的如期落实，受田锡恩经理的委托，袁瑞新同志在肩负党委领导工作的同时，又担起了抓好老区生产经营的重任，以保证经理能够全身心地抓好改扩建重点工程建设。经过3年的艰苦奋战，到今年国庆节前，唐钢“七五”改扩建总体规划已提前一年全部实现，各重点建设工程已相继建成投产和试生产，老区的生产经营也连续4年夺得河北省第一利税大户，1988年实现利税3.56亿元，较1985年翻了一番还多。为此唐钢荣获了全总颁发的“五一劳动奖状”，袁瑞新同志也被党政部门一致推荐当选为1988年河北省劳动模范。
    在履行党委书记的职责、抓好党的队伍自身建设上，袁瑞新一到任就狠抓党员的教育培训工作，使唐钢各级党组织得到了健康的发展，党建工作取得了明显成绩。
    针对企业党组织职能转换期部分党务工作者思想上一度出现的消极观点，他带头撰写论文，组织大型研讨会，并在各级党报党刊上发表论文。在各级党务干部专题培训班上，他根据自己在“党委领导下的厂长负责制”时期当经理的切身感受，大讲加强思想政治工作的重要性。
    由于思想统一，平稳顺利地完成了公司及各直属单位的机构改革，把应由经理负责的工作全部划归了行政，保证了党委以主要精力抓好党的自身建设。这期间他又突出抓了端正党风和党内的廉政建设，制定了一班人防腐保廉的措施和规范，保证了唐钢党员队伍的战斗力和凝聚力。目前在唐钢的各级各类先进人物中，党员占了90％以上，唐钢分别被省、市委命名为“先进基层党组织”，今年初，唐钢又被中宣部和全总联合命名为“全国思想政治工作优秀企业”。
    袁瑞新坚信喊破嗓子，不如做出样子，坚信廉能生威，廉洁自律、克己奉公就能带出有战斗力的好班子、好队伍。因此他坚持做到四个不特殊：一是政治上不特殊，坚持参加所在支部的组织生活，接受党小组的民主评议和鉴定；二是生活上不特殊，坚持在机关食堂同职工一样排队买饭，多年来一直坚持骑自行车上下班；三是在待遇上不特殊，与班子成员一道，坚持拿职工的平均奖，自己压低了上级规定的奖金标准，两次推谢了省里点名给班子主要成员的承包奖励；四是在家庭和亲属问题上不特殊，多次谢绝了一些单位对自己亲属的提拔、调动，坚持让他们在原岗位工作。
    正是由于袁瑞新同志及党委一班人的影响，唐钢党的建设和经济建设都取得了巨大成绩。
    今年国庆节前，他又光荣地被中央组织部命名为“全国优秀党务工作者”，接受了党和人民给予的最高荣誉，并作为唐山市唯一的代表进京参加了“全国先进基层党组织和优秀党务工作者”的表彰大会。
