The cradle of humanity is where? The recently discovered "South African Ape" skull fossil from Yun County, Hubei, announced to the world: China is one of the cradles of early humans.

This skull fossil, which has just undergone preliminary restoration by experts, appears much lower and more flat than the "Peking Man" skull. From the exposed upper jaw and hard palate, it is clear that the dental arch is nearly parabolic, with the front part of the dental arch distinctly arched; the cheek teeth on both sides show a slight tendency to spread backward and outward. The incisors are relatively vertical, the canines are not large, and the crowns of the molars are low. The palate is deep, and the zygomatic process is positioned relatively forward. Experts believe that these are all typical characteristics of the "South African Ape." More than ten experts and scholars, including renowned Chinese archaeologist and paleoanthropologist Jiā Lánpō, unanimously agree that this skull belongs to the "South African Ape" genus and is already one to two million years old. It is believed that this discovery is the first of its kind in China and in Asia. Jiā Lánpō said that this discovery can be compared to the significance of the discovery of the first skullcap of Peking Man.

The "South African Ape" fossil is extremely important material for studying the origin and development of humans. Since the 1920s, a considerable number of "South African Ape" fossils have been discovered in Africa. The academic community generally believes that the "South African Ape" is the direct ancestor of humans, so the academic world has long considered Africa to be the cradle of humanity. The discovery of the "South African Ape" in Yun County proves that China is also a cradle of humanity.

It is reported that this major discovery was made by Wáng Zhènghuá and Qū Shèngmíng of the Yun County Museum during a cultural relics survey in May of this year, in Mítuósì Village at the mouth of the Qūyuǎn River in Yun County.

    湖北发现“南方古猿”头骨化石
    证明中国是早期人类发祥地之一
    本报武汉11月15日电　记者龚达发报道：人类的摇篮在哪里？今天在这里展示的新近发现于湖北郧县的“南方古猿”头骨化石向世界宣告：中国是早期人类发祥地之一。
    这具刚刚经过专家初步修理的头骨化石，看上去比“北京猿人”头骨低矮得多，从显露的上颌齿弓及硬腭清楚地看到，齿弓近于抛物线形，前部齿弓明显呈弧形；两侧颊齿略有向后向外展开的趋势。门齿比较陡直，犬齿不大，臼齿的齿冠低。腭较深，颧突位置较靠前。专家认为，这些均是“南方古猿”的典型特征。我国著名的考古学家、古人类学家贾兰坡等十多位专家、学者一致认为，这具头骨属于“南方古猿”类，距今已有一二百万年。据信，这一发现，在我国、在亚洲都是首次。贾兰坡称，这一发现可与北京猿人第一个头盖骨发现的意义相比。
    南方古猿化石是研究人类起源和发展极为重要的实物资料。自本世纪20年代以来，在非洲发现了相当丰富的南方古猿化石。学术界一般认为，南方古猿是人类的直系祖先，因此世界学术界以为非洲才是人类的发祥地。郧县南方古猿的发现，证明中国也是世界人类的发祥地。
    据介绍，这一重大发现是湖北郧县博物馆王正华、屈胜明今年5月进行文物普查时，在该县曲远河口弥陀寺村发现的。
