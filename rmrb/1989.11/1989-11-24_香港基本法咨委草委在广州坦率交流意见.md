The two-day exchange meeting between the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee and the Drafting Committee concluded this afternoon at the White Swan Hotel in Guangzhou.

This exchange meeting is the first time since April this year, when Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Wang Hanbin led mainland drafting committee members to visit Hong Kong, that both sides have exchanged views on the Basic Law. Li Hou, Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and Secretary-General of the Basic Law Drafting Committee, told reporters that the main purpose of the exchange meeting is to listen to the opinions of the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee on the draft Basic Law.

Over the past two days, members of the Consultative Committee have frankly exchanged views on the provisions of the Basic Law regarding the relationship between the central government and the local government, the political system, the economy, education and culture, as well as the basic rights and obligations of residents. In discussing the political system, the Consultative Committee generally agreed that the provisions of the Basic Law on the political system are designed to follow the principles of gradual progress, stable transition, and balanced representation, and that there will be a certain period of stability at the beginning of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. There were no major disagreements on this point. However, several schemes for the political system were discussed and exchanged in more detail.

In his speech, Li Hou mentioned the issue of "not allowing Hong Kong to become a base for subverting the central government." He pointed out that using Hong Kong as a base to impose Western systems on the mainland is not permissible.

　　香港基本法咨委草委在广州坦率交流意见
    本报广州11月22日电　新华社记者黄日尧、本报记者谢荣镇报道：为期两天的香港基本法咨委与草委交流会，今天下午在广州白天鹅宾馆结束。
    这次交流会是自今年4月底全国人大常委会副委员长王汉斌率领内地草委访问香港以来，双方首次就基本法问题交流意见。国务院港澳办公室副主任、基本法起草委员会秘书长李后对记者说，交流会主要是听取香港基本法咨询委员会对基本法（草案）的意见。
    两天来，咨委会成员就基本法中央与地方关系、政治体制、经济、文教以及居民的基本权利和义务等条文坦率地交换了意见。在交流对政制的意见时，咨委对基本法有关政制的条文设计符合循序渐进、平稳过渡、保持均衡代表性的原则，以及香港特别行政区成立初期有一定的稳定期，认识基本一致，没有太大的意见。而政治体制问题的几个方案，则花了较多的时间进行交流、讨论。
    李后在发言中谈到关于“不允许香港成为颠覆中央政府的基地”的问题。他指出，把香港作为基地将西方的一套搬到内地，那是不容许的。
