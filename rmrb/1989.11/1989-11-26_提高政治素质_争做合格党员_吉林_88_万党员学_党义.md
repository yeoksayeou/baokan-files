Over the past year, party organizations at all levels in Jilin Province have deeply carried out activities to learn the spirit of "Party Principles" and strive to be qualified Communist Party members. All 880,000 party members in the province have participated in this activity, promoting the improvement of party members' qualities and the role of being vanguards and models.

Initially, an ordinary party member from the Changchun Locomotive Works, using the pseudonym "Party Principles," anonymously assisted a retired worker in financial difficulty for a full year. After the name "Party Principles" became known, the public said, "Party Principles" spirit is the spirit of communism, a reincarnation of the Lei Feng spirit in the 1980s. At the end of last year, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision to carry out activities to learn the spirit of "Party Principles" and strive to be qualified Communist Party members among all party members in the province.

Jilin has used various forms such as television, radio, and lectures to promote the spirit of "Party Principles." Many places have combined several aspects in their work: First, combining the learning of "Party Principles" spirit with the "Create Excellence and Strive for the First" activities, they have launched a competition titled "Carry Forward the Spirit of 'Party Principles' and Bring Warmth to the People." Second, combining the learning of "Party Principles" spirit with anti-corruption efforts. The leaders of 40 counties, cities, districts, and bureaus in Changchun held democratic life meetings titled "Learn 'Party Principles,' Examine Yourself, and Promote Clean Governance," conducting criticism and self-criticism to solve existing problems. Third, combining the learning of "Party Principles" spirit with the commendation of advanced individuals, deeds, and thoughts, they have summarized and established a number of "Party Principles"-style advanced models, enriching the learning content. Fourth, combining the learning of "Party Principles" spirit with the implementation of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, they have consciously maintained a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee, considered the overall situation, understood the big picture, and performed their duties faithfully to do a good job.

The activities to learn "Party Principles" have strengthened the concept of serving the people wholeheartedly among the majority of party members. Over ten thousand party members in Yushu City have redrafted plans to help the poor, successively helping 1,600 households to start new industrial and sideline production projects. In Liufangzi Town, Gongzhuling City, 480 party members have each taken responsibility for 204 impoverished households, helping to solve funding issues and purchase fertilizers and seeds. Party members across the province have donated 165,000 yuan, helped the people with 450,000 good deeds, and brought the warmth of the Party to thousands of households, rapidly enhancing the Party's prestige among the people. Various levels of organizations have received 74,000 letters of praise.

Through learning "Party Principles," party member leaders at all levels have practiced self-discipline and avoided seeking personal gain. By the end of June, party member leaders at the vice-bureau level and above in the municipal departments of Changchun have refused 120 gifts and 23,000 yuan in bribes. Many party and government leadership organs have also established and improved clean governance systems. Dongliao County has formulated a system for the declaration of family property by party and government leaders, placing leaders under the supervision of the people.

As the learning activities deepen, the Party's style of work influences the people's style of work, and the social atmosphere in many places in Jilin Province has improved significantly.

    提高政治素质　争做合格党员
    吉林88万党员学“党义”
    本报讯　近一年来，吉林省各级党组织深入开展学习“党义”精神、做合格共产党员的活动，全省88万党员参加了这一活动，促进了党员素质的提高和先锋模范作用的发挥。
    最初，长春机车厂一名普通共产党员化名“党义”，默默无闻地资助一名生活困难的老工人达一年之久。“党义”的名字传开后，群众说，“党义”精神就是共产主义精神，是雷锋精神在80年代的再现。去年底，中共吉林省委作出决定，在全省广大党员中深入开展学习“党义”精神、做合格共产党员的活动。
    吉林各地通过电视、广播、报告会等多种形式，宣传“党义”精神。许多地方在工作中注意几个“结合”：一是学习“党义”精神与“创先争优”活动相结合，开展了“发扬‘党义’精神，为群众送温暖”的竞赛活动。二是学习“党义”精神与廉政建设相结合。长春40个县、市、区、局党委领导班子的成员，普遍过了一次“学‘党义’，查自己，促廉洁”的民主生活会，开展批评与自我批评，解决存在的问题。三是学习“党义”精神与表彰先进人物、先进事迹、先进思想相结合，总结树立了一批“党义”式先进典型，丰富了学习内容。四是学习“党义”精神与贯彻十三届四中全会精神相结合，自觉同党中央保持高度一致，顾大局，识大体，忠于职守，做好工作。
    开展学习“党义”活动，使广大党员全心全意为人民服务的观念增强了。扶余市万余名党员重新制订了帮贫扶弱规划，先后帮助1600个农户开辟了工副业生产新项目。公主岭市刘房子镇480名党员，分别将204户贫困户包下来，帮助解决资金，购买化肥、种子。全省党员捐款达16.5万元，帮助群众做好事45万件，将党的温暖送到千家万户，党在群众中的威望迅速提高。各级组织收到表扬信7.4万余封。
    各级党员领导干部通过学“党义”，克己奉公，不谋私利。到6月末，长春市市直机关副局以上党员领导干部拒礼120件，拒贿2.3万元。许多党政领导机关还建立健全了廉政制度。东辽县制定了党政领导干部家庭财产申报制度，将领导干部置于群众的监督之下。
    随着学习活动的深入，党风带动民风，吉林省许多地方社会风气为之一新。
