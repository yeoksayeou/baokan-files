Prague, known as the "Garden City of Europe," has built a massive underground system—the metro—in the past decade or so.

The Prague metro, though lacking the antiquity of London's, the opulence of Paris's, or the grandeur of Moscow's, is as exquisite and beautiful as the ancient city of Prague itself, with its unique style.

The Prague metro is currently over 30 kilometers long, with three lines: A, B, and C. Line B is the longest, with a travel time of 25 minutes. The waiting halls of the three lines are each decorated with materials rich in national characteristics and adorned with murals symbolizing the features of each station.

Taking the metro in Prague is very convenient. It directly reaches the most bustling Wenceslas Square, the Old Town Square with its collection of ancient buildings, and various major districts within the city, as well as famous cultural venues like the National Theatre. The metro station halls are not deep underground. To facilitate passengers entering and exiting from various directions, each metro station has 4 or 5 exits, with some having as many as a dozen. Some metro stations are built in the center of residential areas, with exits just a few dozen meters from apartment buildings, making it very convenient. Inside the metro halls, you rarely see service personnel. The entire hall is controlled by closed-circuit television. The hall is equipped with automatic ticket machines and exchange machines. Elevators are used for entering and exiting the underground waiting halls. The spacious and bright metro halls serve as both pedestrian underpasses at intersections and comprehensive service facilities with food stores, daily necessities stores, bookstores, etc., offering a variety of goods. In August 1987, the Chinese Record Company held its first exhibition and sale in the record store at the Republic Square metro station hall.

Taking the metro in Prague is very safe and punctual. During peak hours, a train arrives every 2 minutes, and there are almost no delays. Since the first section of the metro began operating on May 9, 1974, there have been almost no major traffic accidents in the past decade or so. The only thing that metro workers are dissatisfied with is that, because there are no ticket inspectors at the stations, there are some people who ride without buying tickets. Once "freeloaders" are discovered by metro inspectors, they are fined 200 koruna according to regulations.

The streets of the ancient city of Prague are narrow, and with the increasing number of cars, traffic on the surface has become more and more congested. Since the metro was built, the traffic situation has significantly improved. Since the first line began operation, the number of passengers transported annually has increased from the initial 64 million to the current 300 million. Over the past decade, more than 3 billion passengers have been transported, accounting for one-third of the total passenger volume of all transportation tools in Prague, making the metro the most important transportation tool in Prague.

Currently, the Prague metro continues to extend at a rate of 1 kilometer per year. By the year 2000, the total length of the metro will reach over 40 kilometers, and at that time, residents will find it even more convenient to take the metro.

　　布拉格的地铁
　　孙希有
    素有欧洲花园城市之称的布拉格，近十几年来建成了巨大的地下长龙——地铁。
    布拉格的地铁虽没有伦敦地铁的古朴、巴黎地铁的豪华、莫斯科地铁的宏伟气派，但它像古色古香的布拉格一样，精巧美观，别具风格。
    布拉格地铁现全长30多公里，分A、B、C3条线路。B线最长，列车需行驶25分钟。3条线路的候车厅分别用最富有本国民族特色的材料装饰而成，并绘有象征着各个车站特点的壁画。
    在布拉格乘地铁十分方便。可直接到达最繁华的瓦茨拉夫大街、集古建筑之大全的老城广场和市内各个主要街区，以及民族剧院等著名文化场所。地铁车站大厅距地面不深。为了方便乘客从各个方向进出，每个地铁车站都有4、5个出口，最多的有十几个出口。一些地铁车站建在住宅区的中心，出入口离居民楼只有十几米远的距离，十分方便。在地铁大厅内，你偶尔才能看到服务人员。整个大厅由闭路电视控制。大厅内设有自动售票机和自动兑换机。出入地下候车厅全部用电梯输送。宽敞明亮的地铁大厅既是十字路口处行人地下通道，也是设有食品店、日用品店、书店等的综合服务设施，这里各种商品琳琅满目。1987年8月，中国唱片公司就在共和国广场地铁站大厅里的唱片商店举行了首次展销会。
    在布拉格乘地铁十分安全、准时。乘车高峰时每2分钟一趟，极少误点。自1974年5月9日第一段地铁投入运行迄今，十几年来几乎没发生重大交通事故。唯一使地铁工作人员不满意的是，由于车站不设验票员，也有个别不买票乘车的人。“揩油者”一旦被地铁检查人员发现，则按规定被罚款200克朗。
    布拉格古城道路狭窄，随着汽车数量的不断增加，地面交通愈来愈拥挤。地铁建成后，使交通状况明显改善。自第一条线路运行以来，每年运送的乘客从最初的6400万人次增加到现在的3亿人次。十几年来共运送乘客30多亿人次，占布拉格各类交通工具运输量的1／3，成为布拉格最重要的交通工具。
    目前，布拉格的地铁每年继续以1公里的速度向前延伸，到2000年，地铁总长度将达到40多公里，届时，居民乘车也将更加方便。
