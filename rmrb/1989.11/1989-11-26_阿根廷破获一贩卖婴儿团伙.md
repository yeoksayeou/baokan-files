Argentine police have recently uncovered a criminal gang specializing in the trafficking of newborn infants and the sale of infant organs.

According to reports, this criminal gang has been operating in Argentina for the past eight years. Argentine police discovered the gang during investigations in the province of Entre Ríos and the federal district of Buenos Aires.

The gang initially contacted single young women who were about to give birth, offering to buy their newborns. They then sold these infants to couples with fertility issues, pricing them between $3,000 to $5,000 each, depending on the infant's skin color.

　　阿根廷破获一贩卖婴儿团伙
    阿根廷警方最近破获了一个专门从事贩卖新生婴儿和婴儿器官的犯罪团伙。
    据报道，这个犯罪团伙八年前开始在阿根廷活动。阿警方是在恩特雷里奥斯省和首都布宜诺斯艾利斯联邦区等地进行调查时发现这一团伙的。
    据报道，这个团伙先同一些即将分娩的单身青年姑娘接触，向她们提出购买新生婴儿，然后再按照婴儿的肤色以每个婴儿三千至五千美元的价格，出售给那些有生育障碍的夫妇。
