Title: A Chat on the National Debt Issues in Western Countries

When it comes to national debt, people naturally think of the United States first. Let's look at these figures: the accumulated national debt is $2.7 trillion, annual interest payments on the national debt amount to $150 billion, and the national debt accounts for 56% of the Gross Domestic Product. Just these figures alone are enough to make one feel apprehensive. However, Japan, which is known as the world's largest creditor nation, also faces a heavy domestic debt burden. An article in the August issue of the Japanese magazine "Jewel" revealed that by the 1989 fiscal year, Japan's accumulated national debt had reached 162 trillion yen, and 21% of the taxes paid by the people were used to pay interest on the national debt. Another statistic shows that Japan's national debt accounts for 67.3% of its Gross Domestic Product.

In fact, it is not just the United States and Japan; other major industrialized countries in the West are also bearing the heavy burden of huge national debts. According to figures published by the Italian Bank's "Economic Bulletin," the national debt of the other five Western countries as a percentage of their Gross Domestic Product in the previous year were as follows: Canada 69.5%, the United Kingdom 46.1%, West Germany 44.1%, France 37.2%, and Italy as high as 96.5%. The heavy burden is evident.

National debt is a byproduct of fiscal deficits. However, to a certain extent, appropriate borrowing by a country can help expand government budget expenditures, increase investment in public works, and stimulate business equipment updates and personal consumption expansion. In fact, the economies of most Western countries have indeed developed in this "debt economy." However, as the accumulated debt continues to swell, the proportion of the total debt to the Gross Domestic Product continues to increase, and its negative effects become more apparent. People have already felt that the heavy burden of national debt is damaging the conditions for balanced economic growth in these countries. Some even warn that the high debt will drag the development of the Western economy into a dangerous situation, and the bonds in people's hands "are becoming piles of dirty things that could trigger an economic crisis."

This is not an exaggeration. Huge national debts will not only make it difficult for the governments of these countries to escape the embarrassing predicament of financial difficulties, but more seriously, they will have a great destructive impact on the financial markets and normal economic operations of Western countries. First, the expansion of national debt increases the conflict between the government and the private sector in competing for funds in the credit market. This not only hinders the expansion of private investment but also puts heavy pressure on the financial market, thereby driving up market loan interest rates. This is undoubtedly a potential unfavorable factor for most Western countries that are about to take measures to avoid a new round of economic recession. Second, the issuance of huge national debts requires the continuous payment of interest. As national debt interest continues to expand, government fiscal budgets become difficult to control. This will make the most important tool for Western countries to regulate the economy since the war—the fiscal policy—relatively ineffective. At the same time, due to the increasing amount of national debt issued, a considerable portion of the national debt will be purchased by the central bank in the case of limited private purchasing power. This increases the opportunity to expand the money supply, and the result is that the other important tool for government intervention in the economy—monetary policy—will also become relatively ineffective.

For this reason, Western governments have now begun to resolve to reduce fiscal deficits and control the expansion of national debt. However, it is indeed not easy to truly remove this tumor.

### 西方国家国债问题琐谈

　　西方国家国债问题琐谈
　　孙　毅
    谈起国债，人们自然会首先想到美国。先看这些数字：国债累计额2.7万亿美元，每年支付的国债利息1500亿美元、国债占国内生产总值的比重达56％。仅此数项，就足以使人望而生畏了。然而号称世界第一大债权国的日本，其国内债务负担并不亚于美国。日本《宝石》月刊8月号上的一篇文章披露，日本到1989年财政年度国债的累计额已达162万亿日元，国民交纳的税金21％要用于支付国债利息。另有一项统计表明，日本的国债占国内生产总值的比重已高达67.3％。
    其实，并不只是美国和日本，西方其它主要工业国也同样在承受着巨额国债的沉重压力。据意银行《经济简报》公布的数字，西方其它5国去年的国债占国内生产总值的比重分别为：加拿大69.5％、英国46.1％、西德44.1％、法国37.2％，意大利竟高达96.5％。其负担之重可见一斑。
    国债是财政赤字的衍生物。不过，从一定意义上说，国家适量举债，有助于扩大政府的预算支出，增加公共事业的投资，并能刺激企业设备更新和个人消费的扩大。事实上，大部分西方国家的经济也的确在“负债经济”中得到了发展。但是，随着累积的债务日益膨胀，债务总额占国内生产总值的比重愈益加大，其副作用越来越明显。人们已经感觉到，巨额的国债负担正在损害这些国家的国民经济均衡增长的条件。有人甚至惊呼，债台高筑将把西方经济的发展拖向一个危险境地，人们手中握有的债券，“正在成为一堆堆有可能引起一场经济危机的肮脏的东西”。
    这并不是危言耸听。巨额国债不仅将令这些国家的政府难以摆脱资金拮据的尴尬困境，更严重的是，它将对西方国家的资金市场和正常的经济运行机制产生巨大的破坏作用。首先，国债膨胀，扩大了在信贷市场上官民争夺资金的矛盾，这不仅会阻碍私人投资的扩大，而且还会给金融市场造成沉重的压力，从而推动市场贷款利率的普遍上升。这对目前大多数西方国家将要采取措施，以避免新一轮经济衰退来说，无疑是一个潜在的不利因素。其次，巨额国债的发行，需以债息的不断支付为保证，由于国债利息不断扩大，政府的财政预算变得难以控制，这会使战后以来西方国家调节经济的最重要手段——财政政策的作用相对缩小。同时，由于国债发行的数额越来越大，在私人购买能力有限的情况下，相当大的一部分国债将会被中央银行所购买，这就增加了扩大货币发行量的机会，其结果，西方国家政府干预经济的另一个重要手段——货币政策的作用也会随之变得相对缩小。
    正因为如此，现在西方各国政府已开始下决心减少财政赤字，控制国债的膨胀。然而要真正摘掉这个疽瘤也确非易事。
