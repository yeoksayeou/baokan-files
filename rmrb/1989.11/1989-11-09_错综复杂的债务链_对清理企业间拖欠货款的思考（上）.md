You owe me, I owe him, he owes you—thus, a complex web of debt has emerged among enterprises.

It is embarrassing to admit. While ordinary consumers are hoping for a more abundant market supply, the industrial and commercial enterprises that produce and organize goods for the market are being plagued by a massive chain of debts, both owed and owing.

According to the banking sector's estimates, the total amount of inter-enterprise arrears nationwide has reached over 100 billion yuan. Some even estimate it to be over 200 billion yuan. The State Council's Research Office conducted a sample survey of 300 enterprises nationwide and found that over 90% of them have inter-enterprise arrears!

Enterprise production and operations cannot do without capital!

Lanzhou has many raw material production enterprises. Just the aluminum, iron alloys, and petrochemicals sectors account for 40% of the city's industrial output. These raw materials are supplied nationwide. Since the beginning of this year, arrears from various regions have been increasing. By the end of June, the amount owed had reached 740 million yuan, a 40% increase from the beginning of the year, affecting raw material procurement and, in turn, normal production. Statistics show that as of now, the city's enterprises have reduced their raw material reserves by 5% compared to the beginning of the year, and the industrial output value of budgeted enterprises in the first nine months has only grown by 2%.

Xi'an's enterprise structure is different from Lanzhou's, with raw material industries accounting for only 7%. Raw materials are procured from outside, and finished products are sold outside. However, this "both ends outside" situation makes enterprises not only owe others but also be owed by others, facing pressure from both sides. Currently, 20% of Xi'an's budgeted industrial enterprises are either shut down or semi-shut down.

The situation for commercial enterprises is equally dire. By the end of July, the capital shortage in the commercial systems of 20 cities had reached 1.2 billion yuan. Among these, the shortage for pig procurement funds was 550 million yuan, and for sugar procurement funds, it was 420 million yuan. Currently, state-owned commercial enterprises have arrears totaling over 10 billion yuan. Many wholesale stations are stuck in a "non-circulating" state.

Facing this lengthy chain of debts, factory directors and managers are in agony, racking their brains, and going all out to collect debts. They send gifts, host banquets, and put on friendly faces, but the results are minimal. The Xi'an Dongfang Machinery Factory, which did not pay wages for three consecutive months from June to August this year, sent out a "debt collection team" of 40-50 people each month to recover 200 million yuan in goods, but only managed to collect over 10 million yuan. The Tianjin First Commercial Bureau has 6 billion yuan in arrears from outside the province. The bureau system sent out 400 people over a month, spending over 10 million yuan on travel expenses, but only recovered 300 million yuan in goods, which is 1/20 of the total owed.

Facing this lengthy chain of debts, banks across the country have extended their helping hands, but the results are not satisfactory. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Shenyang sent out 22 debt collection teams to 23 provinces and cities this year to help local enterprises collect debts. These provinces and cities owe Shenyang 510 million yuan, but after a month of hard work and spending over 100,000 yuan, they only managed to collect less than 1 billion yuan in debts.

More notably, to untangle the debt chain, the central bank has issued "start-up funds" three times this year, totaling 13 billion yuan, but the effects have not been ideal.

The Wuhan Steel Company has a staggering amount of debt owed. The local bank helped "clear" 1 billion yuan, and production showed signs of improvement. Just after a month, it fell back into the debt trap. This year, Liaoning Province used the 1 billion yuan in loans issued by the central bank twice, all for debt clearance, but the amount cleared was not as much as the amount owed later. Currently, the province's enterprises have increased their arrears from 280 million yuan at the beginning of the year to 5 billion yuan.

The situation is similar for commercial enterprises. The Guangzhou Knitting Station owed factories an average of 350 million yuan in the first quarter of this year. In the second quarter, the bank lent 190 million yuan, and the station's debts initially showed signs of reduction. However, due to the inability to quickly recover funds after goods were shipped out, a large amount of capital was occupied, and a month later, it owed factories nearly 1.9 billion yuan again.

"Truly a difficult debt chain to untangle!" an old banker couldn't help but sigh.

Indeed! Every time the bank helps enterprises clear debts, the enterprises are grateful as if it were a timely rain, but every time, the "rain" stops and the "ground dries up" again.

    错综复杂的债务链 
    ——对清理企业间拖欠货款的思考（上）
    本报记者　潘岗
    你欠我，我欠他，他欠你——于是，企业之间出现了错综复杂的债务链。
    说来令人汗颜。眼下，当普通消费者盼望市场供应更加丰富的时候，那些为市场生产、组织商品的工商企业，却正被大量人欠（应收及预付货款）、欠人（应付及预收货款）的巨额债务链所困扰。
    据银行部门测算，目前全国工商企业相互拖欠货款总额已达1000多亿元。更有人估计为2000亿元以上。国务院研究室对全国300家企业进行抽样调查，发现90％以上的企业相互拖欠货款！
    企业生产和经营，哪样离得了资金！
    兰州市原材料生产企业较多，仅铝、铁合金，石油化工三项就占全市工业产值40％。原材料供应全国。进入今年以来，各地拖欠货款日趋增多，到6月底，人欠货款达7.4亿元，较年初增加40％，以至影响了原料购进，进而影响正常生产。据统计，目前全市企业原材料储备比年初减少5％，前9个月预算内工业企业产值仅增长2％。
    西安市企业构成与兰州相异，原材料工业仅占7％。原材料从外地进，产成品往外销。然而，这种“两头在外”的格局，更使企业不仅人欠，而且欠人，两头受挤。目前，西安地区预算内工业企业停产、半停产的竟占20％。
    商业企业的处境同样不妙。到7月底，仅20个城市的二商系统资金短缺达12亿元。其中，生猪收购资金短5.5亿元，糖进货资金少4.2亿元。目前，国营商业企业的拖欠已有100余亿。有不少批发站陷入“转不动”境地。
    面对这冗长的债务链条，厂长、经理们心煎难熬，绞尽脑汁，四处出击讨债。送礼、宴请、陪笑脸，但效果甚微。今年6月至8月，连续3个月发不出工资的西安东方机械厂，为收回2000万元的货款，每月派出四五十人的“催款队”，但只收回了百多万元。天津市一商局有外地欠款6亿多元，局系统先后派出400人，费时一个月，花费差旅费100多万元，只收回货款3000万元，是人欠总额的1／20。
    面对这冗长的债务链，各地银行纷纷伸出热情的援救之手，但效果也不甚理想。沈阳市工商银行今年派出22个清欠小组到23个省市帮助当地企业清欠。这些省市欠沈阳5.1亿元，但小组风尘仆仆，历时一个月，花了一万多元费用，也只清回欠款不到一亿元。
    更值得注意的是，为了解开债务链，今年以来，中央银行已三次发放“启动资金”，累计130亿元，但是效果并不理想。
    武汉钢铁公司人欠货款惊人。当地银行帮助“清”了一亿元，生产有了起色。刚过一个月，又陷入债务圈不能自拔。今年以来，辽宁省将中央银行两次投放的10亿元贷款，全部用于清欠，可前清不及后欠的多。目前，这个省企业拖欠已由年初的2.8亿元，增加到50亿元。
    商业企业清欠也是如此。广州市针织站今年一季度欠工厂货款平均达3500万元。二季度，银行贷给1900万元，针织站负债初见减轻。但由于商品调出后不能及时回笼货款，资金被大量占压，一个月后又欠工厂近1900万元。
    “真难解的债务链！”一位“老银行”不由感慨。
    是啊！银行每次帮企业清欠，企业都有“及时雨”的感激，可每次都是“雨”过“地皮”干。
