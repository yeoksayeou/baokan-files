	From Hollywood to Wall Street
	By Zhang Liang, People's Daily reporter

	The Japanese company Sony just completed its acquisition of the American film company Columbia Pictures Entertainment a month ago. On October 30, the Mitsubishi Estate Company paid $846 million to purchase 51% of the shares of the Rockefeller Group, not only gaining control of the company but also making it the largest real estate transaction by a Japanese company in the United States.

	The Rockefeller Group is a famous company in the United States and the world. In bustling Manhattan, New York, the Rockefeller Center and its surrounding 19 skyscrapers are all under the control of the Rockefeller Group, covering an area of 22 acres.

	In this mutually beneficial transaction, both parties have their own plans. Mitsubishi Estate Company sees it as a long-term investment in the United States and also as an opportunity to learn from the Rockefeller Group, so as to bring the experience back to Japan. The Rockefeller Group, on the other hand, is in urgent need of cash to invest in other projects, thereby diversifying its business.

	Japanese companies have, in just one month, moved from Hollywood to Wall Street, and this aggressive move has made Americans feel uneasy. According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Japanese real estate investments in the United States have surged from $744 million in 1984 to $10 billion by the end of 1988. During the same period, direct investments have expanded from $16 billion to $53 billion. Many Americans are asking, who will be Japan's next target?

    “从好莱坞打到华尔街”
    本报记者　张亮
    日本索尼公司收购美国哥伦比亚制片娱乐公司刚满一个月，三菱房地产公司10月30日又以8.46亿美元重金买下了洛克菲勒集团公司51％的股份，不仅获得了该公司的控制权，而且成为日本购买美国房地产中的最大一笔交易。
    洛克菲勒集团公司是美国乃至世界赫赫有名的大公司。在纽约繁华热闹的曼哈顿岛上，洛克菲勒中心及其周围的19座摩天大楼都控制在洛克菲勒集团公司之手，占地22英亩之大。
    在这笔两厢情愿的交易中，双方各有打算。三菱房地产公司把它既看作是在美国的一项长期投资，同时又视为向洛克菲勒集团公司取经的好机会，以便把所获得的经验搬回日本。而洛克菲勒集团公司眼下则急需现金，用以别的投资，进而使其经营项目多样化。
    日本公司在短短一个月内就从好莱坞打到华尔街，这种凌厉攻势使美国人深感不安。据美国商务部统计，日本在美国的房地产已从1984年的7.44亿美元猛增到1988年底的100亿美元，同期内直接投资已从160亿美元扩大到530亿美元。许多美国人在发问，日本的下一个目标是谁？
