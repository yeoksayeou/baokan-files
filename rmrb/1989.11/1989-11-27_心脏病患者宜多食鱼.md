Eating more fish can significantly reduce the mortality rate of heart disease patients. This is the conclusion recently announced by experts from Harvard University Medical School.

Two thousand heart disease patients who participated in the trial ate fish at least twice a week. After two years, their mortality rate was 29 percent lower than that of heart disease patients who reduced their fat intake, and only slightly higher than those who consumed a diet rich in fiber.

This simple, practical, and economical dietary method is undoubtedly good news for heart disease patients. According to Alexander Leff, a preventive medicine specialist at the medical school, the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil can prevent the heart from deteriorating, such as the fatal heart arrhythmias that occur when blood flow to the heart muscle is obstructed. He also said that it is encouraging that increasing fish consumption for a few weeks can produce noticeable effects.

Fish species rich in omega-3 fatty acids include herring, eel, halibut, blackfish, salmon, tuna, mackerel, cod, and red trout.

　　心脏病患者宜多食鱼
    多吃鱼可大大降低心脏病患者的死亡率，这是美国哈佛大学医学院专家们最近宣布的实验结论。
    接受试验的二千名心脏病患者每星期至少吃两次鱼。两年之后，他们的死亡率比采用减少脂肪摄入量办法的心脏病患者低百分之二十九，只是比完全食用多纤维食物的患者略高。
    这种简单易行、实惠而经济的食疗办法对心脏病患者无疑是一大福音。据该医学院的防治医学专家亚历山大·里夫说，鱼油所含的欧米加—3脂肪酸可防止心脏向病变发展，如当流向心肌的血液受阻时发生的致命性心律振颤。他还说，使人感到鼓舞的是，只要增加食鱼量数星期，即可产生明显的效果。
    含欧米加—3脂肪酸较多的鱼类有鲱鱼，鳗鱼，大比目鱼，黑鱼，鲑鱼，金枪鱼，鲭鱼，鳕鱼，红鳟鱼等。（封）
