The rapid development of central cities in various countries is a new trend of the 20th century. The development of central cities in developing countries is particularly rapid. With the progress of urbanization, the supply, consumption patterns, and nutritional needs of urban residents' food have undergone new changes, and there are new demands for the quality and diversity of agricultural products. Ensuring the quality and safety of urban food supply has become a major concern for the public in various countries.

The Trend of Urbanization Development

According to United Nations population research materials, in 1980, the population of developing countries accounted for 75% of the world's total population, with urban population accounting for about 29%.

Currently, the annual average growth rate of the world's urban population is stable at around 2.4%, but due to the large influx of farmers into cities, this alone will increase the urban population by 25 million people each year.

It is estimated that by the year 2000, the world's urban population will account for 39% of the total population, and by 2015, this will increase to 50%. By 2020, the total population of developing countries will exceed 6.5 billion, with an urban population of over 3.4 billion, accounting for 53.5% of the total population. It is estimated that by the year 2000, there will be 79 cities in the world with a population exceeding 4 million, of which 59 will be in developing countries. The population of these large cities will account for 1/4 of the total population of developing countries.

New Demands on Food Due to Urbanization

The development of urbanization will inevitably increase the demand for agricultural products.

According to research materials from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, from 1980 to 2000, to meet the food needs of the growing urban population, approximately 2.9 billion tons of wheat will need to be produced locally. This alone, calculated based on the labor productivity of each agricultural worker, requires Africa to increase by 24%, Asia by 16%, and Latin America by 17%.

To ensure that urban poor have access to food, stabilize grain prices, and guarantee supply, many governments in developing countries have adopted subsidies, rationing, and quota systems for food supply.

Urban residents and the floating population need to purchase food daily from markets, vendors, or restaurants. To meet the growing and diversifying food needs of people, cities must establish a sound sales structure and system, especially to improve the transportation, storage, sales, supply facilities, and management measures for perishable foods such as fresh fruits, vegetables, livestock products, and fish, to ensure food quality and reduce sales and supply costs.

With the increasing demand for convenience foods in cities, the consumption of wheat and rice will increase.

For example, in Mexico City, the average daily consumption of corn per person decreased from 332 grams in 1960 to 222 grams in 1980, while the consumption of wheat increased from 118 grams to 132 grams. In terms of secondary food products, the demand for fresh foods such as fruits, vegetables, pork, poultry, dairy products, and fish is increasing rapidly.

In cities, due to the increase in the number of single adults and full-time workers and students, the demand for commercialized food and ready-to-eat food has significantly increased, and street food has developed in succession.

To ensure the quality and safety of food supply, various basic and service facilities are needed, and measures must be taken in terms of education, law, and management.

The Importance of Nutrition

In 1986, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization conducted a survey on urban nutrition intervention measures in developing countries. It was believed that with the development of urbanization, developing countries must further strengthen the study of urban food consumption patterns and nutrition issues.

Many countries have established fair-price stores and consumer cooperatives to prevent price increases and stabilize food supply, and have established food reserves and public sales systems to promote the poor's access to food and improve consumption habits.

The nutritional status and food acquisition of citizens need to be monitored, such as the source of goods, prices, and the level of consumers' purchasing power, to guide policies and formulate new measures. For example, in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the poor spend about 30% of their household expenses on public transportation, exceeding the expenses on rent and food, which relatively reduces the purchasing power for food and the nutritional level of the family. The Brazilian government is studying and adjusting reform measures.

### 城市化后——发展中国家食物消费趋向

　　城市化后——
　　发展中国家食物消费趋向
    朱丕荣
    各国中心城市的迅速发展，是20世纪的一个新趋向。发展中国家中心城市的发展尤为迅速。随着城市化的发展，居民食物供应、消费方式和营养需求发生了新变化，对农产品的质量和多样化有了新要求。如何保证城市食物供应的质量和安全性，已成为各国公众普遍关注的重要课题。
    城市化发展的趋向
    据联合国人口研究材料表明，1980年发展中国家的人口占世界总人口的75％，城市人口占29％左右。
    目前世界城市人口年平均增长率稳定在2.4％左右，但单是由于农民大量流入城市，每年就将使城市人口增加2500万人。
    预计到2000年世界城市人口将占总人口的39％，2015年将增加到50％。到2020年发展中国家总人口增加到65亿以上，城市人口将达34亿多人，占其总人口的53.5％。预计到2000年，全世界超过400万以上人口的大城市将达79个，其中发展中国家有59个。这些大城市的人口将占发展中国家人口总数的1／4。
    城市化对食物的新要求
    城市化发展，必然对农产品的需求量增多。
    据联合国粮农组织的研究材料，1980—2000年期间，为供养城市人口所增长的食品需要中，约有2.9亿吨小麦需由当地生产，仅此一项，按每个农业劳动力的劳动生产率计算，非洲需增加24％，亚洲增加16％，拉丁美洲增加17％。
    为了保证城市贫民获得食物、稳定粮价和确保供应，许多发展中国家政府对食物供应采取补贴，凭票证和定量的办法。
    城市居民和流动人口每天都要从市场、摊贩或饭店购买食物。为了满足人们日益增长和变化多样的食品需要，城市必须建立健全的销售结构和体系，特别是要改善新鲜水果、蔬菜和畜产品、鱼等易腐烂的副食品的运输、保存、销售、供应设备和管理措施，以保证食物的质量，并降低销售和供应成本。
    随着城市中对方便食品的需求逐步增多，小麦和大米的消费量将会增加。
    如墨西哥城1960年—1980年间平均每人每日的玉米消费量从332克减少到222克，而小麦的消费量却从118克增加到132克。在副食品中，对新鲜食品如水果、蔬菜、猪肉、禽肉、奶和奶制品、鱼的需要量增加很快。
    城市中由于独身成年人数增加以及工作人员、全日制在校生的增加，对商品化生产的食品和现成食品的需求量显著增加，街头食品相继发展起来。
    为了保证食品供应的质量和安全，需要有各种基础设施和服务设施，还要从教育、法律、管理等方面采取措施。
      需要重视营养问题
    联合国粮农组织1986年对发展中国家的城市营养干预措施进行了调查。认为随着城市化发展，发展中国家必须进一步加强对城市化的食物消费方式和营养问题的研究。
    许多国家为制止涨价和稳定粮食供应，建立了平价商店和消费者合作社，建立粮食储备和公共销售系统，以促进贫民获得食物和改善消费习惯。
    对市民的营养状况和获得食物的情况需要进行监测，如货源、价格、消费者购买力的水平等，以用来指导政策和拟定新措施。如巴西的里约热内卢贫民区贫民在公共交通方面支出的费用约占家庭开支的30％，超过了房租和食物支出，这就相对地降低了对食物的购买力和家庭营养水平。巴西政府正在研究调整改革措施。
