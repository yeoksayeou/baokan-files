Recently, while visiting the countryside, a village cadre told me, "Now that farmers' stomachs are full, they just don't hear the loudspeakers anymore." What this village cadre said is worth our attention.

I remember that in the past few years, rural wired broadcasts were ubiquitous, and villagers could not only timely hear the voice of the Party Central Committee and learn about domestic and international affairs but also promptly know about events in the county and township. However, in recent years, for some unknown reason, many of the broadcast lines leading to each village and household have disappeared, and the loudspeakers on the walls have all become "mute." When villagers want to listen to news or music, they can only rely on their own radios. However, when the county or township has something to convey, it is not as convenient. In recent years, among some farmers, gambling, superstition, and other unscrupulous activities have resurfaced. Some people say that this is related to the neglect of the propaganda and educational role of broadcasts. There is some truth to this. Recently, Li Ruihuan comrade, in reviewing the propaganda and ideological work of the past few years, pointed out that in some places, "positions have been lost." The rural wired broadcast network is probably one of the lost positions?

One loudspeaker is like one propagandist. Rural wired broadcasts can quickly and widely spread the voices of the Party Central Committee and various levels of Party and government leaders to the hearts of farmers. It is one of the most effective tools for educating farmers on policies and laws, improving farmers' ideological and cultural quality, and promoting the construction of rural spiritual civilization. Such a treasure, how can we let it go?

    复鸣吧，农村广播喇叭
    谙萍
    最近下乡，一位村干部对我说：“如今农民肚子饱，就是听不到喇叭叫。”这位村干部说的值得我们重视。
    记得前些年，农村有线广播四通八达，村民们不仅能及时听到党中央的声音，了解国内外大事，而且能及时知晓县里、乡里的事情。可是近几年，不知是何原因，许多通往各村各户的广播线路不见了，墙上的喇叭个个成了“哑巴”。乡亲们想听听新闻，听听戏曲，只能靠自己的收音机，可是县里、乡里有什么事需要传达，就没有那么方便了。近些年来，在少数农民中，赌博，搞封建迷信和其它歪门斜道等有所抬头，有人说，这与忽视了广播的宣传教育作用有关系。这话有一定道理。李瑞环同志最近在回顾近几年的宣传、思想工作时指出有的地方“阵地丢了”，农村有线广播网大概也是丢失的阵地之一吧？
    一个喇叭就是一个宣传员。农村有线广播能把党中央和各级党政领导的声音最迅速最广泛地传播到农民心中，是对农民进行政策、法律教育，提高农民思想文化素质，推动农村精神文明建设最有效的工具之一。这样的宝贝，怎能把它丢了呢？
