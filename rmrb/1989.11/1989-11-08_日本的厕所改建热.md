Currently, a small "toilet craze" is quietly rising in some countries. In this trend, Japan is at the forefront.

Japan currently has approximately 30,000 public toilets, with an average of one toilet for every 4,000 people. Most of these are located in parks, cafes, and near restaurants. After nearly ten years of renovation, Japan's public toilets have largely shed their past image of being dirty, chaotic, and smelly, and have become more aesthetically pleasing, clean, and comfortable.

In 1985, Japan established the National Toilet Association, whose members are mostly scholars, architects, sanitation experts, and municipal officials, totaling over 300,000 people. The president is Seikō Nishioka, a university honorary professor and collector of toilet paper. The association holds an academic conference every year to discuss toilet science, and some people have earned the title of "toilet doctor." The association also holds an annual "Best Toilet" competition, awarding the top ten toilets and using this to promote toilet reform nationwide. Last year, the association also established a "Toilet Museum," displaying various toilet models and toilet-related products. The Toilet Association has decided to designate November 10th as Japan's "National Toilet Day," organizing extensive publicity and activities, including large-scale toilet exhibitions. This activity has caused a significant international response, and it is expected that more countries or regions will embark on toilet reform in the future. Some people have already proposed the establishment of a World Toilet Association.

In recent years, Japan has seen an increasing number of specialized manufacturers producing toilet fixtures, including many high-tech products such as air dryers, automatic flushing toilets, and remote-controlled computers. Japanese toilets are gradually becoming more artistic, health-oriented, and tourism-friendly. The architectural styles of toilets in various places are different and diverse. Some toilets have wall paintings and music, and the cultural atmosphere is becoming stronger. A Japanese female artist has gained fame as the "toilet artist." Some manufacturers also produce or plan to produce toilet equipment that combines health and hygiene. For example, some toilets are equipped with medical devices that can automatically record a person's blood type, heart rate, urine routine, and other test data, and some can detect certain diseases; some are equipped with special equipment for hemorrhoid patients to rinse the affected area; and some can process feces into odorless granular fertilizer. The health and hygiene functions of these toilets are quite popular among people.

    日本的厕所改建热
    当前，一股小小的“厕所热”正在一些国家悄悄兴起。在这股潮流中，日本走在了最前列。
    日本现有公共厕所约三万多处，平均四千人一处，其大部分设在公园、咖啡厅、饭店附近。经过近十年的改造，日本的公厕大多一改过去的脏乱臭，变得美观、清洁、舒适了。
    一九八五年，日本成立了全国厕所协会，会员多为学者、建筑家、环卫专家和市政人员，总数逾三十万人，会长是手纸收藏家、大学名誉教授西冈秀雄。该协会每年召开学术讨论会，探讨厕所学，有的人因此获得了“厕所博士”头衔。协会每年组织一次“最佳厕所”评比，评出十佳给予重奖，借此推动全国的厕所改革向纵深发展。去年，协会还创办了“厕所博物馆”，陈列各种厕所模型和厕所用品。厕所协会还决定每年十一月十日为日本的“全国厕所节”，开展广泛的宣传与组织工作，包括举办大型厕所展。这一活动在国际上引起很大反响，预料今后将有更多的国家或地区走上厕所改革之路，目前已有人建议成立世界厕所协会。
    近几年，日本涌现出愈来愈多的专业厂家，生产厕所用具，其中包括许多高技术产品，诸如风干机、自动冲水马桶、遥控微机等。日本的厕所正逐步实现艺术化、保健化和旅游化。各地的厕所建筑形式不同，风格迥异。有的厕所内挂着壁画，播放音乐，文化色彩愈来愈浓。一位日本女画家已成名为“厕所画家”。一些厂家还生产或即将投产与卫生保健相结合的厕所设备。如有的马桶本身就是一组医用器械，能自动记录人的血型、心率、尿常规等化验数据，有的能检测出一些病症；有的装有专供痔疮患者冲洗患处的设备；还有的能把粪便加工成颗粒状无臭味肥料。厕所的这些卫生保健功能颇受人们的欢迎。（余洋）
