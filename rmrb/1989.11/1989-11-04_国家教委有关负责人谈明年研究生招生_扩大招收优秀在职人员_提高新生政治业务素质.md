Newspaper reporters Zhao Wei and Bi Quan Zhong report from Beijing: An official from the State Education Commission revealed today that the graduate admissions policy for next year will not undergo major changes, but certain specific aspects will be improved and adjusted.

The official pointed out that next year's graduate admissions will adhere to the principle of demand-based enrollment, expanding the recruitment of in-service personnel with practical experience, and improving the political and professional qualities of graduate students. It is understood that the number of graduate admissions next year will be arranged at 30,000, including approximately 25,000 master's students and 5,000 doctoral students. This number is roughly equivalent to this year's actual admissions.

When asked whether next year will still recruit master's students from among university graduates, the official said that due to the needs of certain specialties and the current shortage of qualified in-service personnel, excellent university graduates will remain an important source of master's students. Next year, approximately 10,000 master's students will be recruited from university graduates. Different disciplines and specialties have different requirements for the proportion of university graduates recruited. Generally speaking, some disciplines and specialties in the sciences and foreign language specialties in literature are more suitable for continuous study, so the proportion of recruits from university graduates should be higher; while most disciplines and specialties in engineering, agriculture, and medicine are applied disciplines, recruiting from excellent in-service personnel with practical experience may be more beneficial for training, so the proportion of recruits from university graduates should be lower; as for some disciplines and specialties in philosophy and social sciences, it is more appropriate to mainly recruit from excellent in-service personnel with practical experience. She said that the state encourages excellent university graduates to gain practical experience for a period before pursuing further education, and at the same time encourages excellent university graduates who are admitted to master's programs to retain their admission qualifications, be assigned to related grassroots practices for about two years, and then pursue a degree.

The official said that to facilitate a comprehensive assessment of moral, intellectual, and physical qualities, next year's recruitment of master's students from university graduates will adopt a method of selection through recommendations from the students' graduating schools and examinations (assessments) by the admitting institutions. Recommended graduates will not participate in the national unified examination but will only be examined or assessed by the admitting institution, while those not recommended by their schools will not be eligible to apply for graduate studies. After implementing this method, the previous practice of recommendation and exemption from the examination will be abolished. The official said that the State Education Commission has issued a special document outlining the basic requirements for recommendation conditions, organizational leadership, and work procedures. The specific methods for recommending graduates can be determined by each school based on the principles of being conducive to talent selection and promoting undergraduate education, with the key being to improve the transparency of recommendations. The number of recommended university graduates nationwide will be higher than the number of graduates recruited next year. She pointed out that the examination methods for in-service personnel will remain the same as this year, that is, participating in the national unified examination (initial examination), and being selected after the admitting institution's re-examination; those who have worked continuously for four years after graduating from university and meet the specified conditions can participate in the selection examination organized by higher education institutions authorized by the State Education Commission.

Regarding the system and policies related to directed training of graduate students, the official said that directed training of graduate students refers to graduate students who, upon admission, have their post-graduation work units clearly specified through contracts, with their training costs provided by the state to the training institutions. The recruitment objects for directed training of graduate students are mainly excellent in-service personnel from units that require directed training, and such candidates will be given priority for admission.

It is understood that the registration time for master's students next year will be: February 7 to February 11 for in-service personnel; and March 25 to March 30 for university graduates. The unified examination time for in-service personnel will be April 14 to April 16. The selection work for university graduates and in-service personnel participating in the separate examination will be completed by May 25.

    国家教委有关负责人谈明年研究生招生
    扩大招收优秀在职人员
    提高新生政治业务素质
    本报北京11月3日讯　新华社记者赵卫、本报记者毕全忠报道：国家教委有关负责人今天透露，明年的研究生招生政策无重大变化，但某些具体环节将有所改进和调整。
    这位负责人指出，明年研究生招生将本着贯彻按需招生的原则，扩大招收有实践经验的优秀在职人员，提高入学研究生的政治业务素质的精神进行。据了解，明年研究生招生数按3万名安排，其中硕士生约2.5万人，博士生约0.5万人。这个数字与今年实际招生数相当。
    在谈到明年是否还从大学应届本科毕业生中招收硕士生时，这位负责人说，由于某些专业的需要和当前合格的在职人员生源仍然不足等原因，优秀应届大学本科毕业生仍是硕士生招生的一个重要来源。明年从大学应届本科毕业生招收硕士生的数量约1万名。对各学科、专业招收大学应届本科毕业生的比例有不同要求。具体说来，理学中的一些学科、专业和文学中的外语类等专业，一般适宜连续学习，从应届本科毕业生中招生比例就应大一些；而工学、农学、医学中多数是应用性学科、专业，从有实践经验的优秀在职人员中招生，可能更有利于培养，因此从应届本科毕业生中招生的比例要低一些；至于哲学、社会科学中的一些学科、专业，则应主要从有实践经验的优秀在职人员中招生为宜。她说，国家鼓励优秀的大学本科毕业生先到实践中锻炼一段时间再深造，同时鼓励被录取为硕士生的优秀应届本科毕业生保留入学资格，先分配到与专业有关的基层实践2年左右再攻读学位。
    这位负责人说，为了有利于德、智、体全面考核，明年从应届本科毕业生中招收硕士生，将采取由学生毕业院校推荐和招生单位考试（考核）的办法选拔。经学校推荐的本科毕业生将不参加全国统一考试，而只由招生单位组织考试或考核，未经学校推荐者则不得报考研究生。实行这一办法后，过去研究生招考过程中的推荐免试的作法将被取消。这位负责人说，国家教委已专门发出文件，对推荐条件、组织领导及工作程序提出了基本要求，推荐生产生的具体办法可由各校本着有利于选拔人才，有利于促进本科教学的原则，自行确定，关键在于提高推荐透明度。全国推荐应届本科毕业生的数字将高于明年从应届本科毕业生中招生的数字。她指出，在职人员的报考办法，仍与今年相同，即参加全国统一考试（初试），经招生单位复试后选拔；大学本科毕业后连续工作满4年，符合规定条件的可参加国家教委授权的高等院校组织的单独考试选拔。
    对于定向培养研究生的制度及有关政策，这位负责人说，定向培养研究生，是指在招生时即通过合同形式明确其毕业后工作单位的研究生，其学习期间的培养费用由国家向培养单位提供，定向培养研究生的招生对象，主要是要求定向培养的用人单位中的优秀在职人员，对这类考生将优先录取。
    据了解，明年硕士生的报名时间为：在职人员2月7日至2月11日；应届本科毕业生3月25日至3月30日。在职人员统一考试时间为4月14日至4月16日。应届本科毕业生和参加单独考试的在职人员的选拔工作将于5月25日前结束。
