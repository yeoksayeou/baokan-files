French prominent opposition figure and former Minister of Justice Alain Peyrefitte yesterday pointed out during a debate on the foreign affairs budget in the French National Assembly that France often adopts inconsistent foreign policies, and that France's policy of sanctioning China is doomed to fail.

French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas subsequently mocked Peyrefitte in his speech, saying that Peyrefitte's recent four-part television series "When China Awakens" was propaganda for China following the Tiananmen incident.

Peyrefitte immediately refuted this, saying that the programs were made during his visit to China last year, and accused the government of continuing to lead economic sanctions against China, while other Western countries had decided not to implement them.

    阿兰·佩雷菲特在法国民议会指出 
    法国制裁中国政策注定要失败
    本报巴黎11月8日电　记者吕网大报道：法国著名反对派人士、前司法部长阿兰·佩雷菲特昨天在法国国民议会审议外交部财政预算的讨论会上指出，法国经常采取不连贯的外交政策，法国制裁中国的政策注定要失败。
    法国外长迪马随后在发言中讽刺佩雷菲特最近在电视台主持播出的四集专题节目《当中国觉醒时》是在天安门事件之后替中国作宣传。
    阿兰·佩雷菲特当即反驳说，这些节目是去年访问中国时制作的，并指责政府还在带头实行对中国的经济制裁，而其它西方国家已决定不予执行了。
