Title: Four Major Drawbacks of Elementary School "After-School Tutoring Classes"

Last year, under the influence of the "revenue generation" atmosphere prevalent across various sectors, elementary schools in Tianjin's Hangu District widely established "after-school tutoring classes." What were the actual results? According to a survey report submitted by some members of the district's Political Consultative Conference and members of democratic parties, these "after-school tutoring classes" have four major drawbacks.

First, they increase the burden on students and affect their health. The state regulation stipulates that elementary school students should not spend more than six hours in school per day. However, after the establishment of "after-school tutoring classes," students spend at least eight hours in school, with some even exceeding ten hours. The so-called tutoring is merely making students do their homework in the classroom. This not only fails to stimulate students' interest in learning but also fosters a dislike for studying.

Second, they disrupt the normal teaching order and affect teaching quality. The phenomenon of "tutoring classes not providing tutoring" is widespread. Many schools have cashiers, accountants, boiler operators, and gatekeepers taking turns to supervise the students in the classroom. Students who need tutoring do not receive it, and outstanding students do not receive individualized guidance. The subject teachers are powerless because they cannot enter the classroom when it is not their turn to teach. Class teachers also cannot find the time to do individual counseling with students. This squeezes out the time schools use to organize various activities during breaks, directly affecting the discovery and cultivation of various talents.

Third, they cause a chain reaction and affect middle school teachers. According to relevant documents, each elementary school student pays a tutoring fee of five yuan per month, totaling nearly one million yuan annually for the district's urban elementary schools. Elementary school teachers' monthly "revenue generation" is generally between 50 to 70 yuan, making their actual income higher than that of middle school teachers, which dampens the enthusiasm of middle school teachers.

Fourth, they violate teacher ethics and affect the image of teachers. Providing after-school tutoring for students is part of a teacher's duties. Nowadays, fees are often charged for everything, and some teachers in schools compete for "tutoring classes" for the sake of "tutoring fees," while few are interested in self-study classes. Where will this lead our teachers? It not only corrupts the minds of our teachers but also subtly corrupts the hearts of elementary school students.

### 小学“课后辅导班”有四大弊端

    小学“课后辅导班”有四大弊端
    去年，在各行各业搞“创收的气候影响下，天津市汉沽区各小学校普遍办起了“课后辅导班”。实际效果怎样呢？据这个区部分政协委员、民主党派成员最近提出的一份调查材料表明，这种“课后辅导班”有四大弊端。
    一、加重了学生负担，影响了学生健康。国家规定小学生在校学习时间每天不超过六小时。可是搞“课后辅导班”后，学生在校时间最少八小时，有的甚至超过了十小时。所谓辅导不过是让学生在教室里写作业。这样不仅不能激发学生的学习兴趣，相反滋长了厌学情绪。
    二、冲击了正常的教学秩序，影响了教学质量。辅导班不辅导的现象普遍存在。不少学校让出纳、会计、烧锅炉的、看传达室的都轮流进教室看孩子。一些学习较差需要辅导的学生却得不到辅导，一些尖子生也得不到个别指导，任课老师无能为力，因为不该他们顶班时进不了教室。班主任要做个别学生的思想工作也找不到人，挤掉了学校利用课余开展多种活动的时间，直接影响了各种人才的发现和培养。
    三、引起连锁反应，影响了中学教师。按有关文件规定，小学生每人每月交辅导费五元，全区城市小学的学生近万名，每年这项辅导费收入四十余万元。小学教师每月所得“创收”一般在50至70元之间，使实际收入高于中学教师，挫伤了中学教师的积极性。
    四、有悖师德，影响了教师的形象。对学生进行课外辅导，本是教师份内事。如今动辄收费，“一切向钱看”，学校里一些教师为了“辅导费”而抢“辅导课”，而自习课却很少有人问津了。这样下去，会把我们的教师引向何方？它不仅腐蚀着我们教师的思想，而且还潜移默化地腐蚀着小学生们的心灵。
