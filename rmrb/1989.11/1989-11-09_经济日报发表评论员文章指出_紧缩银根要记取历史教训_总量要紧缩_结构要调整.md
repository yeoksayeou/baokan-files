The People's Daily reported that on November 3, the Economic Daily published an editorial titled "Learn from Historical Lessons – Is the Tightening of Monetary Policy Excessive?" The full text is as follows:

Last September, when the nationwide financial turmoil occurred, the central government promptly made the decision to rectify and regulate, and credit was once again tightened. Now, a year has passed. What is the result? From the beginning of the year to October 26, the country cumulatively withdrew 0.71 billion yuan from circulation, while in the same period last year, 472.4 billion yuan were injected, a difference of 473 billion yuan. This result far exceeded the initial estimates of the monetary situation. However, the operation of the economy has once again raised the old problems that had previously forced a large-scale credit injection: the average industrial production growth rate in the first half of the year was over 10%, and public opinion was relaxed; in July, August, and September, it continued to decline, dropping to 0.9% in September, and public opinion suddenly surged. The issue of funds once again became the focal point of contradictions, and monetary policy is facing another difficult choice.

It Cannot Be Tight Without Shrinking

Let's first analyze the credit situation. By the end of September this year, the state's credit income and expenditure were 377 billion yuan less than the same period last year, which can be considered a great success. First, the rapid growth of the currency supply in the circulation sector was quickly curbed, curbing the overheated economy and initially stabilizing the financial situation; second, the lessons of past loose-then-tight policies were learned, and the necessary tightening was done during the appropriate period. By the fourth quarter, when the demand for funds peaks, there was sufficient preparation, avoiding the need to increase the money supply. It can be said that without the tightening of the total amount in the first nine months, today's results would not have been achieved. The question is, has the tightening been excessive? This is a question that needs to be answered. First, in the first nine months, the increase in bank loans accounted for 37.6% of the annual loan plan, and in the past 10 years, seven years had a lower proportion, which is sufficient to show that this year's loan progress has not been excessively tightened in terms of total amount. In our country, most loans need to be issued in the fourth quarter for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products and for industrial enterprises to prepare for the next year's materials. In 1987 and 1988, this proportion was 45.8% and 64.4%, respectively, and these two years were years when the issuance was excessive in the first nine months and strong tightening was carried out during the fourth quarter peak demand, which is abnormal. Second, what was supported this year? In the first nine months, the increase in loans was more than 90% for state-owned industries, grain, foreign trade, and agriculture, of which the increase in loans for state-owned industries and material supply and marketing enterprises was 45 billion yuan more than the same period last year, grain loans were more than 150 billion yuan, and foreign trade loans were 28 billion yuan more. Third, what was suppressed this year? In the first nine months, loans to township enterprises were 74 billion yuan less than the same period last year, loans to circulation sector companies and others were more than 130 billion yuan less, fixed asset loans were 94 billion yuan less, and trust loans were 30 billion yuan less. Overall, in the first nine months, the total loan amount was more than 370 billion yuan less than the same period last year, and the state's protected enterprises and key industries' fund investment was actually more than 220 billion yuan more than the same period last year, which was achieved by suppressing the non-key fund needs of more than 300 billion yuan. What needed to be suppressed was suppressed, and what needed to be protected was protected, achieving the goal of strict control of the total amount. Therefore, we cannot simply blame the slowing down of industrial production growth on the tightening policy, nor can we tighten without shrinking.

How to Understand the Tightness of Funds During the Tightening Period

Why are funds tight? This first encounters the problem of what standard to use for measurement. In recent years, the economy has maintained high-speed growth, investment scale has been too large, and consumption has been high. To support this situation, 10 years of reform have resulted in 9 years of fiscal deficits, not only has the accumulated debt become a heavy burden on the fiscal system, but the fiscal balance of the next few years also faces serious difficulties; in the latter 5 years of reform (1984-1988), the currency has been in a period of high issuance, and the amount of currency issued in 5 years is more than twice the total amount issued from 1949 to 1983. It is clear that in recent years, the overheated economy, expanded investment, and consumption have been maintained by the huge deficits of the fiscal and credit systems. As a result, in the context of macroeconomic tightening, it is inevitable that such problems will arise: to maintain the original economic speed and to keep all enterprises alive, funds will definitely be universally tight. The so-called tightness is relative to the original inflated demand, but from the perspective of curbing inflation, the goal has not yet been achieved. The only way out is to tighten the total amount and adjust the structure, to suppress what needs to be suppressed without hesitation, and to ensure what needs to be protected, to rectify the economy and lay the foundation for the next step of development. Moreover, in the first nine months of this year, the industrial production growth rate was 8.9%, which cannot be called a recession, and the economic cooling should be seen as the effect of tightening; the production in July, August, and September has been declining, but the industrial structure is beginning to improve, and the production of energy, electricity, raw materials, and agricultural support products is steadily rising, with the largest decline in non-key industries. Tightening has provided conditions for structural adjustment and improving enterprise quality. Now, the overall concept is particularly important, and we cannot relax the monetary policy because some enterprises are facing operational difficulties, making the tightening half-hearted. Of course, we must fully support the state's key industries to maintain a reasonable industrial production speed and prevent stagnation.

Another reason for the tightness of funds is the rise in prices. According to a survey by the bank of 1,200 industrial production enterprises, the purchase price of production materials in 1988 was 52.8% higher than in 1985. According to the current working capital occupied by industrial enterprises, maintaining the original production scale would require an additional 180 billion yuan in loans to turn over. The problem is that the increased income from price increases and inventory appreciation has not been used to supplement the enterprises' own working capital but has been used for investment and consumption. The proportion of self-owned working capital of budgetary state-owned enterprises in the total working capital was 42.5% in 1978 and dropped to 18% in 1988. This situation is unsustainable. Tightening is to curb excessive demand and thereby reduce prices. If the supply of funds follows the price increases, this is undoubtedly adding fuel to the fire, and the rectification of inflation becomes an empty talk. Therefore, to solve the problem of fund tightness caused by price increases, it is necessary to start from the internal rectification of enterprises, to supplement self-owned funds, which is not a reason to relax the monetary policy.

Historical Lessons to Be Learned

Now, due to the macroeconomic tightening, it indeed brings great difficulties to production and circulation. We can only endure the pain of the rectification period and do everything possible to activate production and circulation. In this regard, it is beneficial to review our country's recent years of experience.

In 1984, credit was out of control, and 262 billion yuan was issued in one year, which was more than the total amount issued in the 30 years before the reform. As a result, a comprehensive tightening had to be carried out in 1985. The effect of this tightening also became apparent a year later. In early 1986, industrial production hit rock bottom, resulting in nationwide panic. Where should the monetary policy go? At that time, although there were many good opinions in the theoretical circles and practical departments, the macroeconomic decision-making still led the economy onto the path of expansion. This policy continued until the autumn of 1987. The price signal reminded people that a strong tightening policy had to be implemented again, which was the background for the introduction of the dual-tight policy (tightening fiscal and credit) at that time. At that time, the central bank used reserve measures, used interest rate measures, and opened a mandatory special deposit for credit cooperatives. By the end of 1987, the national currency and credit grew by only about 19%, and the effect began to appear. However, as soon as it entered 1988, under the guidance of the idea that industrial speed should not "slide," the tightening policy was forgotten again, and another peak of large-scale credit issuance was formed. By August 1988, due to the excessive demand accumulated over several years, it pushed prices to rise sharply, finally triggering a nationwide run on deposits and rush to buy goods, and various specialized banks all faced payment difficulties—this was the background for the third strong tightening since September last year.

It is worth noting that the previous two tightenings were both abandoned halfway, and both used industrial speed to replace macroeconomic balance. The decision-making idea at that time seemed to be that the existence of excessive demand was acknowledged, but it was not worried that it would bring any danger; while the cooling of the economy was a terrible thing. This "inflation is harmless" theory finally led our country's economy into a difficult period of rectification and regulation. This tightening has again reached a critical moment, and the monetary policy is facing another choice. If it is said that the previous two tightenings without shrinking still had the ability to bear macroeconomic control, then if another uncontrolled impact occurs this time, it is certain that the subsequent rectification will be even more difficult.

    紧缩银根要记取历史教训
    总量要紧缩  结构要调整
    本报讯　经济日报11月3日头版发表题为《记取历史的教训——回答紧缩银根是否过度了》的评论员文章，全文如下：
    去年9月，当全国性的金融风潮发生之际，中央及时作出了治理、整顿的决策，信贷再次进行了紧缩。现在一年过去了，结果怎么样呢？从年初到10月26日，全国累计净回笼货币0.71亿元，而去年同期是净投放472.4亿元，相差473亿元之多。这个结果，远远超出了年初人们对货币形势的估计。然而，经济的运行又提出了过去曾经迫使信贷大投放的老问题：上半年工业生产平均速度10％以上，舆论缓和；7、8、9三个月陆续下滑，9月份降到0.9％，舆论骤起，资金问题再次成为矛盾的焦点，货币政策又面临着一个艰难的抉择。
    不能紧而不缩
    我们先分析一下信贷情况。到今年9月底，在国家信贷收支上比去年前9个月少发放377亿元贷款，应当说这是个极大的成功。第一，使流通领域过快增长的货币供应量迅速得到了抑制，遏制了过热的经济，初步稳定了金融；第二，吸取了过去前松后紧的教训，该紧的时期紧了，到第4季度用款高峰时已有足够的资金准备，不致被迫增发货币。可以断言，如果没有前9个月总量上的紧缩，不会换来今天这个结果。问题是，紧缩是否过度了？这是需要回答的问题。第一，前9个月，银行贷款增加额占全年贷款计划的37.6％，在前10年中，有7个年份低于这个比重，这足以说明今年的贷款进度在总量上并没有紧缩过度。在我国，贷款大部分要在第4季度投放，用于农副产品收购和工业企业为第二年备料作准备，而1987年、1988年这个比重分别高达45.8％和64.4％，这两年都是前9个月投放过度，到4季度用款高峰时反而进行强硬紧缩的年份，这是不正常的。第二，今年支持的是什么？在前9个月的贷款增加额中，国营工业、粮食、外贸和农业贷款占90％以上，其中国营工业和物资供销企业贷款比去年前9个月的增加额还多45亿元，粮食贷款多150多亿元，外贸贷款多28亿元。第三，今年压的是什么？前9个月，对乡镇企业贷款比去年同期少发放74亿元，对流通领域的公司等少发放贷款130多亿元，固定资产贷款少发放94亿元，信托等贷款少发放30亿元。总的看，前9个月，贷款总量比去年同期压缩370多亿元，国家保的企业和重点行业的资金投入量反而比去年同期多增加220多亿元，这是通过压缩非重点资金需要300多亿元实现的。该压的压，该保的保，实现了总量从严控制的目标。因此我们不能把工业生产速度下滑笼统地归咎于紧缩政策，更不能紧而不缩。
    如何认识紧缩时期的资金紧张
    资金为什么紧张？这首先遇到一个用什么标准去衡量的问题。这些年，经济持续高速，投资规模过大，消费居高不下。为支撑这种局面，10年改革，财政9年赤字，不仅累积起来的债务是财政的沉重负担，而且今后几年的财政年度平衡也面临着严重困难；在改革的后5年（1984年至1988年），货币始终处于投放的高峰期，5年投放的货币比1949年到1983年货币投放的总量还多两倍多。很明显，这些年过热的经济、膨胀的投资和消费，是靠财政和信贷的巨大逆差维系着。结果，在宏观紧缩的情况下必然出现这样的问题：要保持经济的原有速度，要让所有的企业都活下去，资金肯定普遍紧张。所谓紧，是对原来膨胀的需求而言，但从治理通货膨胀的要求看，还远未达到目标。出路只能是，总量要紧缩，结构要调整，该压的不能手软，该保的必须保证，通过治理，把经济理顺，为下一步的发展奠定基础。何况，今年前9个月工业生产速度是8.9％，这不能叫萎缩，经济降温应视为紧缩的成效；7、8、9三个月的生产陆续下降，但产业结构开始好转，能源，电力、原材料和支农产品的生产稳步回升，降幅最大的是非重点产业。紧缩为结构调整和提高企业素质提供了条件。现在，全局观念格外重要，不能因为某些企业经营困难而要求放松银根，使紧缩半途而废，当然，对国家的重点产业要全力去保，要保持工业生产的合理速度，防止滞胀的出现。
    资金紧张的另一原因是物价的上涨。据银行对1200户工业生产企业调查统计，1988年生产资料购进价格比1985年上升52.8％，按目前工业企业占用流动资金算，维持原有生产规模也要增加1800亿元贷款才能周转动。问题是，产品涨价和库存升值增加的收入并没有相应补充企业自有流动资金，而是用于投资和消费了。预算内国营企业自有流动资金占全部流动资金的比重，1978年是42.5％，到1988年下降到18％。这种状况是维持不下去的。紧缩是为了抑制过旺的需求，进而降低物价，如果资金供给随着物价走，这无疑是推波助澜，治理通货膨胀成了一句空话。因此，解决涨价带来的资金紧张问题，必须从企业内部整顿入手，要补充自有资金，这不是放松银根的理由。
    应当记取的历史教训
    现在由于宏观的紧缩，的确给生产、流通带来了极大的困难。对此，只能忍受治理期的痛苦，千方百计把生产、流通搞活。在这里，回顾一下我国近几年的经历是有益处的。
    1984年信贷失控，一年投放了262亿元票子，比改革前的30年投放总量还多。结果，1985年不得不进行全面的紧缩。这种紧缩的效应也是到一年后才显露出来。1986年初工业生产掉入谷底，结果全国一片惊慌。货币政策向何处去？当时尽管在理论界和实际工作部门有很多好的意见，但当时宏观的决策依旧使经济走上了扩张的道路。这种政策一直持续到1987年的秋季，物价信号提醒人们，不得不再次实行强硬的紧缩政策，这就是当时双紧方针（紧缩财政和紧缩信贷）提出来的背景。当时中央银行动用了准备手段，动用了利率手段，对信用社开办了强制性的特种存款，到1987年末，全国的货币、信贷只增长19％左右，开始见到成效。但是，刚刚跨入1988年，在工业生产不要“滑坡”的思想指导下，紧缩的方针又被忘记，再次形成信贷大投放高峰。到1988年的8月，由于几年积累下来的过大的需求，推动着物价大幅度上涨，终于诱发出全国性的挤兑存款、抢购商品的风潮，各家专业银行都出现了支付困难——这是去年9月以来第三次进行强硬紧缩的背景。
    值得注意的是，前两次紧缩所以半途而废，都是用工业速度取代了宏观平衡，当时的决策思想似乎是，承认过大需求的存在，但并不担心它会带来什么危险；而经济的降温，则是可怕的事情。这种“通货膨胀无害论”，终于把我国经济引上了一个治理整顿的艰苦时期。这次紧缩又到了一个关键时候，货币政策又面临着一个如何抉择的问题。如果说前两次的紧而不缩，经济还有承受宏观失控的能力的话，那么这次再来一次失控的冲击，肯定地讲，以后的治理就更困难了。
