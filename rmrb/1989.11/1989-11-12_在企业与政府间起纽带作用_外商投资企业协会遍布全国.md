Currently, the organizational structure of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) Foreign Investment Enterprises Association (FIEA) has spread across the entire nation. Including provincial, autonomous region, municipal, and special economic zone levels, 45 local associations have been established. The number of enterprise members has increased from 507 at the time of the national association's founding two years ago to over 3,000, accounting for approximately half of the nation's operational enterprises.

As a unified organization for foreign-invested enterprises, the association has effectively served as a bridge between enterprises and the government. The national and local associations have organized dialogues between enterprises and government leaders and relevant department heads, facilitating communication, exchanging views, and jointly addressing problems. Follow-up actions have been taken to implement the outcomes of these dialogues. Associations in cities like Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Fuzhou, which were established earlier, have been particularly active in these dialogue activities. The Sichuan Provincial Association, with the support of banks, has helped enterprises alleviate financial difficulties. During and after the June 4th incident, the association actively promoted China's unchanged policy of opening up to the outside world, visiting enterprises that continued production and foreign investors who remained at their posts. Almost none of the foreign-invested enterprises ceased production.

Over the past two years, the association has organized four delegations of Sino-foreign joint ventures to participate in the Canton Fair, two delegations to participate in the Far East Economic Trade Fair, and other domestic and international exhibitions. These efforts have helped enterprises promote their products and expand their sales markets. The association has also handled enterprise complaints seriously, conducting thorough investigations and doing its best to resolve issues.

    在企业与政府间起纽带作用
    外商投资企业协会遍布全国
    本报北京11月11日讯　记者计泓赓报道：目前，中国外商投资企业协会组织基本上遍布全国。包括省、自治区、直辖市、计划单列市、经济特区等在内的地方协会，已成立45个。企业会员数，由两年前全国协会成立时的507家，增加到3000多家，约占全国已投产开业企业的一半。
    作为外商投资企业自己的联合组织，协会很好地起到了密切企业与政府联系的纽带作用。全国协会和地方协会普遍组织企业与政府领导、有关部门负责人对话，沟通情况，交换意见，共商如何解决遇到的问题，事后又抓紧落实对话成果。成立较早的成都、广州、福州等市协会，对话活动尤为活跃。四川省协会在银行的支持下，帮助企业缓解了资金融通上的困难。今年“6·4”事件前后，协会积极向外商投资企业宣传我国对外开放政策不变，慰问坚持生产的企业和坚守岗位的外商。外商投资企业几乎无一停产。
    两年中，协会已组织4次中外合资企业交易团参加广州交易会，2次参加远东博览会活动，以及其它国内外展销活动，帮助企业推销产品，开拓销售市场。对企业的投诉，协会均认真受理，深入调查，想方设法帮助解决。
