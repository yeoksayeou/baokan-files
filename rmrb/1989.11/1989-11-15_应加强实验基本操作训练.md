Title: Strengthening Training in Basic Experimental Operations

I have been working for a short time since graduating from school and have found that a lack of training in basic experimental operations can reduce the accuracy of experimental data. This is a problem that deserves attention.

Many schools emphasize training in high-difficulty operations while neglecting basic operations. Sometimes, individuals are proficient in high-difficulty operations but struggle with simple ones, even to the point of being stumped.

For example, in agricultural experiments, measuring the height of crops, canopy coverage, and observing the growth period of crops are among the most basic tasks. Most people who have studied these would probably be able to do them. However, the data observed by three individuals, A, B, and C, can vary significantly, with differences reaching 30%. Apart from individual observational abilities, there is another important factor: basic operational training was neglected during school. If even the most basic data is not accurate, or if it has a high "water content," then what use are the high-difficulty operational data built on this foundation? Can the experimental results be reliable? This example highlights a similar phenomenon in other simple operational experiments. This problem has a certain degree of universality.

This problem may seem small, but if not addressed properly, it can lead to a waste of manpower and resources, causing significant harm. I hope that teachers in schools will strengthen the training of students in basic operational techniques.

### 应加强实验基本操作训练

    应加强实验基本操作训练
    我从学校毕业参加工作时间不长，在工作中发现，缺乏最基本的实验操作训练，容易降低实验数据准确性，这个问题很值得重视。
    有不少学校只重视高难操作训练，而轻视一般的最基本的操作训练，有时熟习高难操作，遇到简单的操作却力不从心，甚至被难倒。
    例如：在农业试验中，作物株高、郁被度的测定及作物生育期的观测，这些项目可以说是最基本的了，学过的人大概都会。但甲、乙、丙三人观测的数据各有不同，相差竟达30％。这除了与各人的观察能力有关外，还有个不容忽视的问题，即在校学习时，忽视了最基本的操作训练。试想，连最基本的数据都不准确，或者说“含水量很大”，那么，建立在简单操作数据基础之上的高难操作数据又有何用？试验结果能可靠吗？只举了这一例，其他试验的简单操作也有类似现象。这个问题具有一定普遍性。
    这个问题似乎很小，可是，若解决得不好，会造成人力、物力的浪费，危害很大。希望学校教师加强学生基本的操作技术训练。
