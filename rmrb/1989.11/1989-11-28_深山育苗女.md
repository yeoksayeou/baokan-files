The early autumn in the south is still a season of lush greenery and fading reds.

That day, I went to the Qingpo Nursery hidden deep in the mountains. When I got off the car, it was noon, and the scorching autumn sun made the distant and nearby mountains all shimmer with a green glow. Especially the seedlings in the valley, so fresh and neat, like a carefully woven green carpet, truly lovable.

Walking along the mountain path, suddenly a strange sight made me pause: in the middle of the seedling field, there was a bamboo pipe about a meter high from the ground, winding its way into the distance. The water flowing inside the bamboo pipe was clear and pure, like a swaying silver thread. Where did this water come from? I was mesmerized. At this moment, a noise came from a nearby gorge. Following the sound, I saw a figure moving on the steep cliff. I quickly asked the nursery director, Old Hu, who was accompanying me, "What is that person doing at noon?"

Old Hu wiped the sweat from his face and smiled, saying, "That's the water-diverting girl. Look, she is splitting bamboo."

As we got closer, I discovered that this was a secluded place. The stone walls were steep, the ancient pines were lush, and a waterfall about a zhang wide cascaded down from the cliff covered with green grass, splashing water and snow, blending with the buzzing of cicadas to create a serene and elegant mountain melody.

The girl known as the water-diverting girl was about twenty-four or twenty-five years old. Her pretty face was flushed with sweat, like a blooming mountain tea flower, and her bright eyes were as clear as a mountain spring. At her feet was a pile of split and hollowed-out green bamboo, with white bamboo joints scattered all over the ground. As soon as she saw us, she quickly scooped up some spring water with a bamboo cup and handed it to us.

Old Hu slowly drank a few mouthfuls and asked, "Alan, what new trick do you have this time?"

Alan smiled but did not answer.

Old Hu pointed to the green patch of seedlings in the valley and said to me, "This mountain land was originally a 'rusty' field where ten out of ten seedlings would die, especially those precious tree species like oil camphor, camphor, teak, snow pine, and bamboo cypress... they just couldn't be cultivated. It's all thanks to her and her father."

"Is her father also a nursery worker?" I blurted out.

"Well..." For some reason, Old Hu signaled with his eyes to her.

A dark cloud covered her clean face, and tears welled up in the corners of her eyes.

I did not ask further and followed Old Hu along the seedling field.

It was deep into the night, and the weather was still stiflingly hot. I went out the door, and from a high vantage point, the nursery buildings were all built on the mountain slope, with lights scattered here and there. A crescent moon darted through the clouds, sometimes bright, sometimes dim, and the distant and nearby mountains, forests, and seedling fields also appeared and disappeared in turn. The night in the deep mountain valley is always quiet, with only autumn insects, frogs, and wild mosquitoes singing freely. Suddenly, a bright flash of lightning was followed by a thunderclap, and then hail and wind poured down from the sky. I hurriedly took cover under the eaves, and at that moment, several moving lights appeared on the winding mountain path. In the flash of lightning, they turned out to be several figures, one of whom seemed familiar. In a flash, they disappeared into the rain curtain.

I was full of doubts. Where were they going?

When I woke up, the rain had stopped and the sky was clear. The morning after the rain was so fresh that it seemed to squeeze out water. I strolled along the mountain road, and the water was rushing, the grass was scattered, and it seemed that last night's sudden rain was indeed not small. However, the rows of seedlings in the valley were even more lush and green.

Seeing Director Hu walking towards me, I mentioned the scene I saw last night in the rain. He laughed: "Those are Alan and her seedling team. They were afraid that the mountain flood would damage the seedlings and went to check. Didn't you see the seedlings covered with plastic film!"

Indeed, in the vast valley, the plastic film was rolling with bright water droplets, shining brightly in the morning sun.

Old Hu told me that cultivating seedlings seemed easy but was actually not. Winter requires protection from frost, spring fears rain, summer requires pest control, and the soil quality is high. Especially weeding, from the time the seedlings sprout, it has to be weeded until the seedlings are dense, a full two or three months. Those weeds are almost the same as the seedlings, tender and soft, and you have to carefully pick them with your fingers. After a day of work, there is no one who does not have a sore back, stiff neck!

"In these years, we have implemented the contract responsibility system, and people's wisdom and creativity have been fully utilized. We have eliminated the deficit cap and made a profit of five or six ten thousand yuan every year!" Old Hu could not hide his pride. "Especially Alan's seedlings, they are strong and beautiful, not only supplying our county, but people from other places also come to order them by name; this girl is like her father, she is diligent, has wisdom..."

"Her father?" I remembered the unfinished conversation from yesterday. "Her father is no longer with us!" Old Hu's expression was a bit gloomy. He said that her father was originally a city gardener. That year, when he came to this remote nursery, Alan was still in swaddling clothes. It is said that her mother died of puerperal fever. When he came to the nursery, seeing the flowers, grass, and seedlings, the worry on his face disappeared, and he spent day and night in the seedlings. He saw that the soil in the valley contained a lot of iron and alkali, so he made do with what he had and used bamboo pipes to divert spring water to wash it. Some people mocked him, some people doubted him. He said, "There are no lazy people, only lazy land. Every inch of land is precious, and it will make a bountiful contribution if people work on it." He really cultivated strong seedlings. Who would have thought that on a stormy night, he got up to check the seedlings, slipped, and fell off the cliff, and never got up again. At this time, Alan was already of working age, and according to the regulations, she could go to the city, but she did not want to leave the land and seedlings that her father had nurtured with his heart's blood. She said, "The nursery is the cradle of the forest, I want to be a good nursery worker, and let all the barren mountains turn green." Thus, she silently took over her father's unfinished work.

"Look, she is coming. This child has not slept for another night!"

In the misty distance, there was indeed a figure moving. She wore a bamboo hat, a raincoat, and carried a mountain hoe on her shoulder. As she came closer, the morning sun outlined her graceful figure. She walked to the bamboo pipe, put down her mountain hoe, and cupped her hands to scoop up some water to wipe her face. Then, she gently sprinkled the water droplets on the seedlings, as if a song was about to leave her lips...

Oh, that long stream of water is not a silver string, and that rippling water sound is not a jumping note? A song of Jiangnan spring, a forest melody, wanders in this lush deep mountain.

　　深山育苗女
　　方叶
    南国的初秋，依然是个绿肥红瘦的季节。
    那天，我到深藏在重峦叠嶂中的青坡苗圃去。下车时正当午，灼灼的秋阳下，远远近近的山野无不泛着苍翠的亮光。尤其是山坳里的一片苗木，那么鲜嫩，整齐，好像精心编织的绿毡，着实招人怜爱。
    沿山间小路＝去。忽然，一个奇特的景象使我惊疑：苗地中央架着一道离地面一米来高的毛竹筒，蜿蜿蜒蜒地伸向远处。毛竹筒里的流水，清澈，纯净，如一根袅动的银丝。这水从哪引来的？我痴痴被迷住了。这时，不远处的峡谷里传来一阵响声。寻声望去，峻峭的岩崖下有个人影晃动，我忙问陪同我的苗圃主任老胡：“大中午的，那人在干嘛？”
    老胡擦了把汗，笑着说：“是引泉女。你看，她不是在破毛竹？”
    近了，才发现这儿是一处清幽所在。石壁峭立，古松蓊郁，一道丈把宽的瀑布从长满碧草的悬崖上跌落，溅珠飞雪，与嘶嘶的蝉声组成和弦，酿出一章恬静、清雅的山林曲。
    那被唤作引泉女的姑娘，约莫二十四五岁，一张俊脸让汗珠浸得红扑扑的，宛如一朵盛开的山茶花，灵秀的眸子，山泉一样清澈。她的脚下是一堆剖开剜净的翠竹，雪白的竹节洒了满地都是。一见到我们，她忙用竹筒舀了泉水递过来。
    老胡徐徐喝了几口，问：“阿兰，你这又有什么仙方妙计？”
    阿兰抿嘴一笑，却不回答。
    老胡指着山坳里那一片绿汪汪的苗地，对我说，这片山地原是十种九无苗的“铁锈”垄，特别是那些珍贵的树种，象油楠、香樟，天竺、雪松、竹柏……怎么也育不成，亏得她父女俩。
    “她父亲也是苗圃工人？”我脱口问。
    “这……”不知为什么，老胡用眼示朝她眨眨。
    她洁净的脸笼上一朵乌云，眼角含着几颗晶莹的泪珠。
    我不再追问，随老胡沿苗地走去。
    夜深了，天气依旧燠焖难耐，走出门来，居高临下，苗圃的楼房都筑在山坡上，灯光点点，错落有致。一弯下弦月在云絮中穿驰，时亮时暗，远近的山影、森林、苗地，也跟着时隐时现。深山沟的夜总是清寂的，只有秋虫、蛙、野蚊在自由吟唱。忽然，一道极亮的闪电过后，雷声炸响了，紧接着雨雹伴随着狂风铺天盖地地砸下来。我慌忙躲进屋檐，就在这时，蜿蜒在山道上游动着几道光斑，闪电下，原来是几个人影，其中一个仿佛熟悉，眼前一晃，匆匆消逝在雨幕中。
    我满腹狐疑，他们干什么去呢？
    一觉醒来，雨霁窗亮。雨后的清晨，空气鲜嫩得捏出水来。沿山间车子路漫步出，流水湍急，草叶狼藉，看来昨夜那场骤雨还真不小。而山坳里的一畦畦苗木却益发青翠欲滴。
    看见胡主任迎面走来，我便便说出昨晚雨中所见的情景。他笑了：“那是阿兰他们育苗组的人怕山洪冲坏了苗木，跑去查看。那些树苗上不是遮盖了薄膜！”
    果然，一马平川的峡谷中，那一方方薄膜上滚动着晶亮的水珠，在晨曦中熠熠闪光。
    老胡告诉我，育苗看似轻松，实在是不易，冬防冻，春怕雨，夏抗虫，土质要求高。特别是拔草，从苗木露头开始，一直要拔到苗木郁闭，整整二三个月。那小草跟苗木几乎一模一样，嫩嫩的，要捏着指头小心翼翼地拣，一天下来，没有不腰酸背疼，脖颈发硬的！
    “这些年我们搞承包，人的聪明才智都发挥出来了，搞掉亏损帽，每年还盈利五六万！”老胡掩饰不住内心的自豪。“尤其是阿兰育的苗，壮而秀，不仅供应本县，外地还慕名赶来定购；这姑娘跟她父亲一样，肯钻，有心计……”
    “她父亲？”我想起昨天未竟的话头。“她父亲早不在了！”老胡的神情有点黯然，说，她父亲原是城市的园艺师，那年来到我们这个僻远的苗圃时，阿兰还背在襁褓里。听说她母亲是得了产褥病去世的。来到苗圃，见到花草苗木，她父亲脸上的愁云消逝了，没日没夜泡在树苗里。他见山坳的泥土含铁碱严重，因陋就简，用毛竹筒引来泉水冲洗。有人嘲笑，有人怀疑。他说，只有懒人，没有懒地，每一寸土地都是珍贵的，靠人改造就会做出丰硕的奉献。硬是育出了壮苗。谁料，一个狂风骤雨的深夜，他爬起来看苗，一个趑趔摔下山崖，就再也没有爬起来。这时，阿兰已到补员的年龄，按规定可以进城去，他却舍不得离开用心血浇灌的土地和苗木。她说，苗圃是森林的摇篮，我要当好树苗的保育员，让所有的荒山都翠绿。于是，她默然接过了父亲未竟的事业。
    “看，她来了。这孩子又是一宵未睡了！”
    雾迷蒙的远处，果然有个人影移来。她头戴竹笠，身披雨衣，肩荷山锄。渐来渐近，晨曦用明丽的笔勾勒出她一婷的身影。她走近毛竹渠，放下山锄，用手掬起一把水擦了擦脸颊，然后，把水珠轻轻弹在苗木上，仿佛有一支歌未出唇……
    哦，那长长的泉水不正是银亮的琴弦，那潺潺的水声不正是跳荡的音符？一曲江南春，森林谣流荡在这葱郁的深山野。
