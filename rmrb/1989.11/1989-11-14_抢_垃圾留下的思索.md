Reflections on "Rushing" for Garbage
Yán Yuán Jiǎn, Quzhou City, Zhejiang Province

The garbage in the county towns under the jurisdiction of Quzhou City, Zhejiang Province, was once unwanted by anyone, and disposing of the "garbage mountains" became a major problem for the sanitation departments. In recent years, garbage has started to become popular. Before dawn, trucks and tractors would rush into the city to "rush" for garbage. Upon investigation, there are two types of people rushing for garbage: citrus farmers and vegetable farmers.

Why do these two types of people "rush" for garbage? The reason is that it is profitable. A tractorload of garbage taken to an orange grove can increase the yield by at least 50 kilograms of citrus, with 1 kilogram selling for 1.2 yuan, totaling 60 yuan; similarly, a tractorload of garbage taken to a vegetable field can increase the yield of vegetables by over 40 yuan. After deducting the transportation and fertilization costs, citrus farmers can net a profit of over 20 yuan per tractorload of garbage, and vegetable farmers can net a profit of nearly 10 yuan.

However, if the same tractorload of garbage is taken to a rice field, it can only increase the yield by about 20 kilograms of rice, which is worth only about 30 yuan. This amount of money is only enough to cover the transportation and fertilization costs. Therefore, grain farmers lack the initiative to go into the city to "rush" for garbage to improve soil fertility. Currently, the price of grain is too low, and the comparative benefits of growing grain versus engaging in industrial and commercial activities or diversified operations are too large, which affects the enthusiasm of grain farmers to improve and enhance soil fertility. This is a problem that deserves high attention.

    “抢”垃圾留下的思索
     浙江省衢州市　严元俭
    浙江省衢州市所属的各县城的垃圾没人要，处理“垃圾山”成了环卫部门的一个大难题。近年来，这里的垃圾开始走俏。天蒙蒙亮，一辆辆手拉车、手扶拖拉机就进城“抢垃圾”了。调查一下，抢垃圾的有两种人：一种是柑桔承包户，一种是菜农。
    为啥这两种人“抢垃圾”呢？原因是有利可图。一手扶拖拉机垃圾运上桔山，至少可增产50公斤柑桔，1公斤卖1.2元，就是60元；同样一车垃圾运到菜地，增产的蔬菜可卖40多元；扣除垃圾运杂费和施肥工本，“抢”到一车垃圾，桔农可净赚20多元，菜农也可净赚近10元。
    同样一车垃圾运到稻田，只能增产20公斤左右稻谷，作议价算，也只值30来元，这些钱只够付运杂费和施肥工本。这样，粮农哪有进城“抢”垃圾培养地力的积极性？眼下粮价太低，种粮和搞工商业、搞多种经营的比较效益差距过大，影响了粮农培养、提高地力的积极性，这是个值得引起高度重视的问题。
