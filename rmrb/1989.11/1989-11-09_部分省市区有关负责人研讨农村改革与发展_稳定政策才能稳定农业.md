The editorial board of the magazine "Rural Work Communications" recently invited leaders from the rural work departments of 21 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as relevant officials from central departments, to summarize the experiences and lessons from a decade of rural reform. They discussed the new situations and problems facing rural work and the basic approach to deepening rural reform. Everyone agreed that the achievements of rural reform over the past decade have been enormous, and that the current situation must be stabilized.

Participants focused on analyzing the current situation of rural reform and agriculture. They noted that since the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Party, especially since last year's central rural work conference, various regions have seriously implemented the policies of rectification and deepening reform. They have made achieving agricultural bounties the main goal and basic task of rural work, leading to continued development in rural areas. However, from an overall perspective, agriculture has not yet emerged from its stagnation, and the situation remains quite severe. Participants unanimously agreed that policies proven effective by practice must be stabilized, and policy continuity must be maintained. Without stable policies, there can be no stability in people's minds, no stability in agriculture, and no basis for deepening reform and developing the rural economy.

Participants believed that to further deepen rural reform and develop the rural economy, the following eight areas of work must be prioritized:

1. Seriously implement the rectification and adjustment policies, regulate the relationship between industry and agriculture, urban and rural areas, and strengthen agriculture as the foundational industry. This will truly change the situation where industry is overheated and agriculture is cold. Investment in agriculture must be increased, as well as investment in agricultural industries. Agricultural infrastructure and large and medium-sized water conservancy projects must be strengthened. The purchasing and pricing system for agricultural products must be reformed, and the scissors difference gradually narrowed. Basic national policies such as family planning and land protection must be adhered to, and macro-management of the rural economy must be strengthened. Agricultural production materials must be managed exclusively, and the external environment for agriculture must be improved.

2. Perfect various forms of the responsibility system, establish and improve pre-production, in-production, and post-production service systems, and establish and strengthen regional cooperative economic organizations and specialized cooperative economic organizations.

3. Further adjust the industrial structure, continue to vigorously develop diversified operations and secondary and tertiary industries, and overcome difficulties in funding, energy, and raw materials. Steadily and healthily develop township enterprises, vigorously develop agricultural development, and plan agricultural regional development. Develop new productive forces to achieve comprehensive development in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries.

4. Continue to reform the financial and circulation systems, further invigorate the rural economy, and vigorously develop planned socialist commodity economy.

5. Focus on reforming agricultural education and science and technology systems, implement agricultural science and technology integration, and actively promote advanced agricultural scientific and technological achievements. Promote science and technology in agriculture.

6. Focus on building socialist spiritual civilization in rural areas, use socialist ideology to occupy the rural battlefield, and persist in educating farmers in socialism, patriotism, hard work, and self-reliance.

7. Focus on building rural grassroots organizations and strengthening the Party's leadership in rural areas.

8. Strengthen agricultural legislation to ensure the smooth development of the rural economy.

Participants said that due to different conditions in various places, the specific content, methods, steps, and time requirements for reform and development will inevitably differ. The country cannot adopt a single model or a one-size-fits-all approach.

    部分省市区有关负责人研讨农村改革与发展
    稳定政策才能稳定农业
    据新华社北京11月8日电　《农村工作通讯》杂志社最近邀请21个省、市、自治区农村工作部门的领导和中央有关部门同志，总结10年农村改革的经验和教训，研讨当前农村工作面临的新情况、新问题及深化农村改革的基本思路，大家一致认为农村10年改革成就巨大，对业已开创的局面，需要稳定。
    与会同志着重分析了当前农村改革和农业形势，大家说，党的十三届三中全会以来，特别是去年中央农村工作会议以来，由于各地认真贯彻执行治理整顿、深化改革的方针，把夺取农业丰收当做当前农村工作的主要目标和基本任务来抓，农村形势继续向前发展，但从整体上看，农业还没有走出徘徊，形势仍相当严峻。大家一致认为，经过实践检验证明是行之有效的党在农村的各项方针政策一定要稳定，要保持政策的连续性。没有稳定的政策，就不能稳定人心，就没有稳定的农业，深化改革、发展农村经济就无从谈起。
    与会同志认为，进一步深化农村改革，发展农村经济，应当抓好以下八个方面的工作：一、要认真贯彻治理整顿的方针，调整工农、城乡关系，加强农业这个基础产业，真正改变工业过热、农业过冷的局面。要增加对农业的投入，增加对农用工业的投资，加强农业基础设施建设和大中型农田水利建设。要进一步改革农产品的购销体制和价格体系，逐步缩小剪刀差。要坚持计划生育、保护耕地等基本国策，加强对农村经济的宏观管理，搞好农用生产资料专营，改善农业的外部环境。二、要完善多种形式的联产承包责任制，建立和健全产前、产中、产后服务体系，建立和壮大地区性的合作经济组织和专业合作经济组织。三、要进一步调整产业结构，继续大力发展多种经营和第二、第三产业，千方百计克服资金、能源、原材料短缺的困难，稳步健康地发展乡镇企业，大力发展开发农业，有计划地组织农业区域开发，发展新的生产力，使农林牧副渔全面发展。四、要继续进行金融体制和流通体制的改革，进一步搞活农村经济，大力发展有计划的社会主义商品经济。五、要抓好农业教育和科技体制的改革，推行农科教统筹和农业技术集团承包，积极推广先进的农业科学技术成果，搞好科技兴农。六、要抓好农村的社会主义精神文明建设，用社会主义思想去占领农村阵地，要坚持对农民进行社会主义教育、爱国主义教育和艰苦奋斗、自力更生的教育。七、要抓好农村基层组织建设，加强党对农村的领导。八、要加强农业立法，保障农村经济的顺利发展。
    与会同志说，由于各地条件不同，改革与发展的具体内容、方法、步骤和时间要求也必然会有所不同，全国不能搞一个模式，不能搞一刀切。
