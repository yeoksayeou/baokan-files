	No More "No Money for Roads, Money for Cars"
	Lian Chengzhi, Director of Liaoning Provincial Department of Communications

	Abroad, there is money for roads and none for cars; in our country, there is no money for roads but money for cars. This raises the question of whether we should plan for the long term or seek immediate gains, which needs careful consideration.

	Currently, 80% of our roads are gravel or dirt roads. These roads have low speeds, high fuel consumption, and high maintenance costs. Asphalt roads, compared to gravel roads, can save 15% on gasoline and diesel, extend tire usage by about 40,000 kilometers, and reduce transportation costs by 18% to 20%. If daily traffic reaches 1,000 vehicles, every 10,000 kilometers of road can save over 110,000 tons of gasoline and diesel, 90,000 tires, and reduce transportation costs by 310 million yuan annually. Building 10,000 kilometers of asphalt roads requires about 500,000 tons of asphalt, which can be used for 15 years. During this period, it can save 1.65 million tons of gasoline and diesel and 1.3 million tires. Even without considering other economic benefits, exchanging 500,000 tons of asphalt for 1.65 million tons of gasoline and diesel and 1.3 million tires is very cost-effective. If high-grade roads are built, the benefits will be even more significant. Experts have proven that the Shendai (Shenyang-Dalian) Expressway has improved vehicle efficiency, reduced vehicle maintenance, and is equivalent to adding a large automobile manufacturing plant and several automobile repair shops. It speeds up the turnover of materials, saves a large number of warehouses, and significantly improves driving safety. The current investment of 2.2 billion yuan will yield social benefits equivalent to several times or even tens of times the investment.

	However, many people still do not recognize the excellent social and economic benefits of roads, especially high-grade roads. Some people, although they complain about driving on "washboard roads," find it hard to accept the cost of building one kilometer of road, which can amount to hundreds of thousands of yuan, and are reluctant to make the decision. This involves a matter of perspective—how to correctly handle the relationship between input and output—we need to think big.

	Currently, to eliminate the backward state of road transportation, we need to increase both the quantity and quality of roads, with the latter being more important. We must adhere to the principle of "two-pronged approach": one hand to maintain existing roads and improve road conditions; the other hand to upgrade and build new roads, including building some high-grade roads and, in particular, some expressways.

    再不能“无钱修路，有钱修车”
    辽宁省交通厅厅长　连承智
    国外是有钱修路，无钱修车；我国是无钱修路，有钱修车。这里有一个是长远打算还是急功近利的问题，需要很好地探讨。
    我国现有公路80％为砂石路和土路。这种路行车速度低，消耗大，维修费用高。沥青路面与砂石路面相比，可节省汽油、柴油15％，延长轮胎使用里程4万公里左右，降低运输成本18％—20％。只要日交通量达到1000车次，每1万公里一年就可节省汽油、柴油11万多吨，轮胎9万多条，减少运输消耗3.1亿元。修1万公里的沥青路面，约需沥青50万吨，一般可使用15年。这期间可节约汽油、柴油165万吨，轮胎130多万条。即使不算其他经济效益，单是用50万吨沥青换取165万吨汽油、柴油和130多万条轮胎，也是非常合算的。若建成高等级公路，那效益就更为可观。专家们论证认为，沈大（沈阳—大连）高速公路提高了车辆的效率，减少了车辆修理，就相当于增加一个大的汽车制造厂和一批汽车修理厂，既加速物资周转，又省去大批仓库，行车安全度也大大提高。现在投资22亿元，而发挥的社会效益将等于投资的几倍、几十倍。
    可是，对于公路特别是高等级公路如此好的社会经济效益，至今许多人还没有认识。一些人虽对在“搓板路”上行车有怨言，但一听说要花多少万元才修一公里路，就难以接受，下不了决心。这里涉及到一个观念的问题，即如何正确处理投入产出的关系——要算大帐。
    当前要消除公路运输落后状况，既要增加公路的数量，又要提高公路的质量，后者尤为重要。就是要坚持“两手抓”：一手抓现有公路的养护，提高公路的路况；一手抓公路的改造和新建，建一些高等级公路，包括有重点地建一些高速公路。
