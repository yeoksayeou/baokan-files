The names of performers from the Shanghai Ballet Troupe are frequently appearing on the list of winners of international ballet competitions. Young performers such as Wang Qifeng, Yang Xinhua, Xin Lili, Zhang Li, Shi Hui, and Cai Lijun have all brought back trophies from international stages.

This autumn marks the 10th anniversary of the Shanghai Ballet Troupe. The troupe has achieved remarkable results and gained fame both at home and abroad.

Over the past decade, the Shanghai Ballet Troupe has staged performances of renowned works such as "Romeo and Juliet," "The Nutcracker," "Carmen," "Giselle," "Don Quixote," "Swan Lake," "The Uncontrollable Daughter," and "Giselle."

In recent years, the troupe has also presented a series of ballet works with national themes, contributing significantly to the development of national ballet. Works such as "Thunderstorm," "Soul," "The True Story of Ah Q," "The Sorrow of Departure," "Song of Youth," "Butterfly Lovers," "The Legend of the White Snake," "Farewell My Concubine," and "Return of the Deer" have been well-received by audiences.

Under the guidance of the party's reform and opening-up policies, the Shanghai Ballet Troupe has established friendly relations with many famous ballet troupes and artists around the world. Several foreign experts have come to the troupe to teach and share their skills. The Shanghai Ballet Troupe has also been invited to perform in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Japan, France, Singapore, Canada, and other countries, participating in the 11th Hong Kong Asian Arts Festival. These efforts have contributed to cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries and have enhanced friendship among the peoples of various nations.

In recent years, the "going abroad trend" has affected many artistic troupes, but the main performers of the Shanghai Ballet Troupe have not been influenced. This is because they love this land and their profession.

　　建团十年　捷报频传
　　上海芭蕾舞团努力为民奉献
    据新华社上海11月24日电　（记者赵兰英、通讯员何世雄）国际芭蕾舞比赛的获奖名单中，不断新添中国上海芭蕾舞团演员的名字。汪齐凤、杨新华、辛丽丽、张利、施惠、蔡丽君等青年演员，纷纷从国际领奖台上捧回了奖杯。
    今秋，正值上海芭蕾舞团建团10周年。春华秋实，上海芭蕾舞团成果累累，驰名海内外。
    十年来，上海芭蕾舞团排演了《罗米欧与朱丽叶》、《胡桃夹子》、《卡门》、《葛佩利亚》、《唐吉诃德》、《天鹅湖》、《关不住的女儿》、《吉赛尔》等世界名剧。
    这些年，上海芭蕾舞团还将一批民族题材的作品推上芭蕾舞台，为发展民族芭蕾舞立下了功劳。《雷雨》、《魂》、《阿Q》、《伤逝》、《青春之歌》、《蝶双飞》、《白蛇传》、《霸王别姬》、《鹿回头》等一批芭蕾舞，深受人们喜爱。
    十年间，在党的改革、开放政策指引下，上海芭蕾舞团与世界许多著名芭蕾舞团和艺术家建立了友好往来。一些外国专家相继来团讲课传艺。上海芭蕾舞团也应邀赴朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、日本、法国、新加坡、加拿大等国演出，参加了第十一届香港亚洲艺术节，为中外文化交流和增进各国人民间的友谊作出了贡献。
    近几年，“出国潮”波及文艺团体，但上海芭蕾舞团的主要演员没有受影响。因为他们热爱这片土地，热爱自己的事业。
