The "kingdom" of robots is on the rise. More than 2,000 years ago, science fiction writers vividly depicted the shape and functions of "robots." The working people also yearned for the arrival of "robots" to replace their heavy or dangerous work. These fantasies, which gave birth to scientific predictions, began to become a reality in the early 1960s. By 1979, the "population" of the "kingdom" of robots had increased dramatically, so people called that year the "first year of robots."

As early as 1954, American engineer George Devol founded the world's first company to manufacture robots. The company produced the world's first practical industrial robot in 1961. Kawasaki Company of Japan introduced robots from the United States in 1968 and manufactured the first batch of robots the following year. Over the past 20 years, industrially advanced countries have competed to develop robots for various fields. According to statistics from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, by 1987, there were 200,000 industrial robots worldwide, with Japan owning 106,000, the United States 29,000, and Western Europe 40,000.

Robot technology involves multiple disciplines such as mechanism science, control engineering, information theory, computers, sensors, materials, bionics, and artificial intelligence. It is a representative comprehensive high-tech of the 20th century. Scientists believe that the development of robot technology can be roughly divided into three generations: The first generation is robots that replace simple physical labor, which are already widely used; the second generation is robots with vision, touch, and some judgment capabilities, such as robots that master arc welding and assembly technology, which are also widely used; the third generation is intelligent robots. These robots are equipped with various sensors and can plan operations based on the objective environment, walk, and have self-learning, self-adaptation, reasoning, decision-making, and self-governance capabilities. This type of robot is expected to be practical in the late 1990s.

Scientists believe that the use of steam engines and other power machinery has partially freed people from heavy physical labor. The application of robots not only can replace people in heavy or dangerous work but also can replace the complex technical operations of skilled technicians and some mental labor.

Currently, industrial robots are mainly used in material processing, loading and unloading of machine tools, spot welding and arc welding, stamping, casting, spraying, polishing, and assembly. In some industrially developed countries, part of the spot welding, spraying, and assembly work in the automobile manufacturing industry has been taken over by robots. Almost all of the assembly work at Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan is now done by robots. According to the Soviet magazine "Science and Life," experts from the Institute of Applied Mathematics and the Institute of Atomic Energy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences have developed a universal robot PK-1, which can perform various tasks: operate machine tools and milling machines, complete welding, assembly, measurement, and inspection work, and even sign on paper with a pen.

Robots are entering thousands of households, performing various service tasks, such as firefighting, and serving as receptionists and other services in hotels, restaurants, and homes. A robot that can understand human speech was used in some hospitals and health centers in the United States in 1986. Western European countries have recently developed robots that can pick oranges and other fruits, picking 60 oranges per minute, while a skilled worker can only pick 10.

With the development of science and technology, the quality and functions of robots are continuously improving, and their uses are becoming more and more extensive. In recent years, some countries have begun to research and apply multi-armed robots. The dual-armed robot developed by the United States is used to inspect the fuselage of the F-15 aircraft, with an efficiency 10 times higher than manual work. The Mechanical Engineering Laboratory of Japan's Agency of Industrial Science and Technology has successfully developed a robot with five fingers similar to human hands, which can firmly grasp objects of complex shapes. This robot is expected to play a role in environments such as nuclear reactors, the seabed, and space that are difficult for humans to enter. According to the "Eureka" plan, Britain and Italy are jointly developing a deep-sea robot, which will be able to work for 250 hours at a depth of 6,000 meters underwater, while current robots can only work for 12 hours at a depth of 4,000 meters. The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to send a robot to Mars in 1998 to collect rock samples.

The widespread application of robots can not only improve the quality of production and other work but also improve efficiency and reduce costs. Therefore, many countries are actively researching and developing robot technology, and the "population" of the "kingdom" of robots will continue to increase significantly. According to a report released by the International Labour Office on August 10 this year, the number of robots worldwide is expected to double every two years, reaching 10 million by the end of the century. This will have a tremendous impact on production, scientific research, services, and employment structures, among other aspects.

　　正在崛起的
　　机器人“王国”
    新华社记者　李长久
    2000多年前，科幻作家们就曾生动地描绘过“机器人”的形状和功能。劳动人民更是憧憬着“机器人”降临人间，代替自己的繁重或危险的工作。这些孕育着科学预测的幻想，到本世纪60年代初，开始变成现实。到1979年，机器人
  “王国”的“人口”急剧增加，因此，人们称这一年为
  “机器人元年”。
    早在1954年，美国工程师乔治·迪波尔就创办了世界上第一家制造机器人的公司。该公司于1961年制造出世界上第一台实用的工业机器人。日本川崎公司于1968年首次从美国引进机器人，并在第二年制造出第一批机器人。20多年来，工业发达国家竞相研制用于各个领域的机器人。据联合国欧洲经济委员会统计，到1987年，全世界已有工业用机器人20万，其中日本拥有10.6万个，美国2.9万个，西欧4万个。
    机器人技术涉及机构学、控制工程、信息论、计算机、传感、材料、仿生学、人工智能等多种学科，是20世纪具有代表性的综合性高科技。科学家们认为，机器人技术在过去的发展大致可分为三代：第一代为代替简单体力劳动的机器人，现已广泛应用；第二代为具有视觉、触觉和一定判断能力的机器人，如掌握弧焊、装配技术的机器人等，也已大量应用；第三代为智能机器人，这种机器人装有多种传感器，能根据客观环境自行规划作业，能行走，具有自学、自适应、推理、决策、自治的能力，这类机器人可望在90年代后期实用化。
    科学家们认为，蒸汽机等动力机械的使用把人们从繁重的体力劳动中部分解放出来，机器人的应用，不仅能够代替人们从事繁重或危险的工作，而且能够取代熟练技术人员的繁杂技术操作和部分脑力劳动。
    现在，工业机器人主要用于材料加工、机床上下料、点焊和弧焊、冲压、铸造、喷漆、抛光、装配等。在一些工业发达国家的汽车制造业中，点焊、喷漆和装配工作的一部分已由机器人承担。日本丰田汽车公司的汽车装配工作，绝大部分已由机器人完成。据苏联《科学与生活》杂志今年第2期报道，苏联科学院应用数学研究所和原子能研究所的专家们已研制出一种通用机器人PK—1，它能从事多种工作：操作机床和铣床，完成焊接、装配、测量、检验工作，并会用钢笔在纸上签名。
    机器人正在走进千家万户，从事各种服务工作，如用于救火，在旅馆、饭店和家庭担任迎送客人和其他服务工作。一种能够听懂人们讲话的机器人，已于1986年在美国的一些医院和保健中心使用。西欧国家最近研制出能够采摘柑桔等水果的机器人，每分钟可摘60个柑桔，而一般熟练工人只能摘10个。
    随着科学技术的发展，机器人的质量和功能不断提高，用途越来越广泛。近几年来，一些国家开始研究和应用多臂机器人。美国研制的双臂机器人，被用于检测F—15飞机舱壁，效率比人工提高了10倍。日本工业技术院机械技术研究所已试制成功具有近似于人手功能的5个指头的机器人，它能够牢牢地抓住复杂形状的东西。这种机器人可望在原子反应堆、海底和宇宙等人类难以进去的环境中发挥作用。根据“尤里卡”计划，英国和意大利正在联合研制深潜水机器人，这种机器人将能够在水下6000米深处工作250个小时，而现在的机器人只能在水下4000米深处工作12个小时。美国航空和航天局计划在1998年送机器人到火星上去采取岩石标本。
    机器人的广泛应用，不仅可以提高生产和其他工作的质量，而且可以提高效率和降低成本。因此，很多国家都在积极研究和发展机器人技术，机器人“王国”的
  “人口”将继续大幅度增加。据国际劳工局今年8月10日发表的一份公报预计，全世界机器人的数目将以每两年翻一番的速度增加，到本世纪末，全世界机器人总数可能达到1000万个，并将对生产、科研、服务和就业结构等诸多方面产生巨大影响。
