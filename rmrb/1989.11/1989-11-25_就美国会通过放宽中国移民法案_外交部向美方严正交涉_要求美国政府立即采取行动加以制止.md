Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 24th.

Regarding the U.S. Congress' passage of the "1989 Emergency Bill to Ease Immigration Restrictions for Chinese Students," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a serious protest with the U.S. side today.

Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Huaqiu summoned the Charge d'Affaires of the U.S. Embassy in China, Mr. Belin, to express the Chinese government's strong indignation and to lodge a strong protest against the U.S. Congress' decision to exempt all Chinese students holding J-1 visas from the requirement to return to China for two years of service after completing their studies. The Chinese government strongly protests this action by the U.S. Congress, which seriously damages educational exchanges between China and the U.S. and further worsens Sino-U.S. relations.

Liu Huaqiu pointed out that requiring government-sponsored students to return to their home country to serve after completing their studies is in accordance with international practice. China and the U.S. had reached a clear understanding on this matter in June 1987. The U.S. Congress' passage of the aforementioned bill not only directly violates international practice but also seriously undermines the bilateral agreement between China and the U.S. The U.S. Congress' actions are a blatant display of hegemony, and the legislative basis it proposes is extremely absurd and unacceptable to us.

He also pointed out that the Chinese side had repeatedly lodged protests with the U.S. side regarding the Congress' attempt to pass this bill, expressing the Chinese side's serious stance and concerns, and demanding that the U.S. government take action to stop it. However, the U.S. side's words and deeds did not match, and no effective measures were taken. The U.S. government is responsible for the Congress' passage of this bill and cannot shirk its responsibility.

Liu Huaqiu said that educational exchanges are a mutually beneficial aspect of Sino-U.S. relations that have long-term significance in promoting friendship between the two peoples. The Chinese government has always attached great importance to and actively supported this. We hope to end the recent disputes between China and the U.S., work together to open up the future, and restore Sino-U.S. relations to normalcy as soon as possible. We do not want to see educational exchanges between the two countries being disrupted and damaged. Regrettably, the U.S. Congress has gone ahead and passed this anti-China bill, further poisoning the atmosphere between the two countries. If this backward and perverse behavior is not stopped in time, it will inevitably have serious consequences for the relations between the two countries.

He said that we have noted that the U.S. side has repeatedly stated that the U.S. government opposes the Congress' passage of the aforementioned bill. We hope that the U.S. government will act in accordance with its words and take immediate action. We hope that the U.S. President will veto the Congress' bill. Otherwise, the Chinese government will have to take strong countermeasures. Any consequences arising from this will be the responsibility of the U.S. side.

　　就美国会通过放宽中国移民法案
　　外交部向美方严正交涉
　　要求美国政府立即采取行动加以制止
    新华社北京十一月二十四日电　外交部副部长刘华秋今天约见美国驻华大使馆临时代办贝霖，就美国国会众议院和参议院分别于十一月十九日和二十日通过了
  “一九八九年紧急放宽中国移民法案”一事，进行了严正交涉。
    刘华秋说，美国国会在这个法案里决定豁免全部持J—1签证中国留学人员必须回国服务两年的限制。对于美国国会这一严重损害中美两国教育交流、进一步恶化中美关系的行动，中国政府表示极大的愤慨，并向美国政府提出强烈的抗议。
    刘华秋指出，要求公费留学人员学成回国服务符合国际惯例。中美双方曾于一九八七年六月就此达成过明确的谅解。美国国会通过上述法案，不仅直接违反了国际惯例，而且严重破坏了中美双边协议。美国国会这一做法是强权政治的大暴露，其提出的立法依据也是极其荒谬的，是我们绝对不能接受的。
    他还指出，中方曾就国会企图通过此案一事多次向美方提出交涉，表明中方的严正立场和严重关切，要求美国政府加以制止。但是，美方言行不一，未采取任何有效措施。对国会通过这一法案，美国政府的责任是不容推卸的。
    刘华秋说，教育交流是中美双边关系中一项互利的、对于促进两国人民友好具有长远意义的内容，中国政府对此一贯十分重视和积极支持。我们希望结束中美之间这几个月的纠葛，共同开辟未来，使中美关系早日恢复正常。我们不愿意看到中美之间的教育交流受到干扰和破坏。令人遗憾的是，美国国会竟一意孤行，悍然通过此反华法案，进一步毒化两国关系的气氛。这一倒行逆施的行为如不及时加以制止，势必给两国关系带来严重后果。
    他说，我们注意到美方多次表示，美国政府反对国会通过上述法案。我们希望美国政府言行一致，立即采取行动，希望美国总统否决美国国会这一法案。否则，中国政府将不得不作出强烈反应。由此而产生的一切后果，将由美国方面承担。
