In recent times, the enterprise contracting system, which primarily includes "two contracts and one link" (contracting for tax payments, technological upgrades, and linking wages and bonuses), will remain unchanged. In the coming two years, the focus of reform for industrial and commercial enterprises will still be on improving the contracting system and lease operations. For enterprises whose contracts expire this year, if they have completed the first round of contracting tasks, have competent main contractors, and have harmonious relationships among the party, government, and workers, and are supported by the majority of workers, they can continue contracting after reasonably adjusting the contracting base and indicators. For a few enterprises where external environmental changes are significant and market conditions are difficult to predict, a one-year fixed economic responsibility system can be implemented. This was announced by Shanxi Provincial Governor Wang Senhao at a recent provincial production work conference to stabilize enterprises.

From January to September this year, the total industrial output value of Shanxi Province increased by 9% compared to the same period last year, and the overall economic situation is good. However, there are also many difficulties. To promote reform, boost morale, dispel doubts, and stabilize enterprises, Wang Senhao, on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, clearly proposed policy opinions on issues that have been widely discussed.

The party organization in an enterprise holds a political core position and is unified with the manager's responsibility system. Currently, it is particularly important to maintain the stability of the enterprise leadership team. The form of the enterprise party and government leadership system should not be changed as long as it is beneficial to establishing the party committee's political core position, strengthening ideological and political work, and improving the production and operation of the enterprise. Mid-level cadres who have been appointed to enterprises should generally not be changed during their term of office.

Further clarify and regulate the income of enterprise managers. The income of enterprise managers who completed or exceeded the contracting tasks according to the contract last year has not yet been realized and should be promptly realized. In the future, the annual income of managers, depending on the completion of the contracting agreement, can be 1 to 3 times the average annual income of the enterprise's employees. For a few managers with particularly outstanding contributions, the income can be appropriately higher, or after discussion with the employees and approval by the local people's government, a one-time reward of a certain amount can be given. For those who fail to complete the contracting agreement, the manager's income (including the deposit) should be deducted, down to retaining half of the basic salary. In addition to salary, comprehensive production bonuses, and contracting realization income, enterprise managers should not receive various special bonuses within the enterprise or accept bonuses from subordinate units. The risk deposit does not participate in enterprise distribution.

The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government pointed out that in the anti-corruption and bribery struggle, it is necessary to investigate and punish according to law, remove all obstacles, but also pay attention to production and consolidate effective reform achievements. For those who have made outstanding contributions in reform and construction, are supported by the masses but have made mistakes, as long as they are not criminal, after correcting their mistakes, they can still work in their original positions.

### 山西稳定完善企业承包制  对企业经营者收入进一步作出规范

    山西稳定完善企业承包制
    对企业经营者收入进一步作出规范
    本报太原电　记者王艾生报道：近期内，以“两包一挂”（包上交税收，包技改，与工资奖金挂钩）为主要内容的企业承包制坚持不变。明后两年，工商企业改革的重点仍然是完善承包制和租赁经营。今年承包到期的企业，能够完成第一轮承包任务，主承包人素质较好，企业党政工三者关系协调，多数职工拥护的，在合理调整承包基数和承包指标后，可继任承包。对于少数因外部环境变化太大、市场情况难以预测的企业，可实行一年一定的经济目标责任制。这是山西省长王森浩日前在全省生产工作会议上，为稳定企业宣布的。
    今年1至9月份，山西全省工业总产值比去年同期增长9％，整个经济形势是好的。但也存在不少困难。为推进改革，振奋精神，消除疑虑，稳定企业，王森浩代表省委、省政府就人们议论较多的问题，明确提出政策性意见。
    企业党组织在企业中处于政治核心地位，与厂长（经理）负责制是统一的。当前，尤其要保持企业领导班子的稳定。企业党政领导体制的形式，只要有利于确立党委的政治核心地位，有利于加强思想政治工作，有利于搞好企业的生产经营，就不要变。已聘任企业的中层干部，在任期内也一般不要变动。
    进一步明确和规范企业经营者的收入。去年按承包合同完成和超额完成承包任务的企业经营者的收入，至今未兑现的要坚决兑现。今后，经营者的年收入，视完成承包合同的情况，可高于本企业职工年平均收入的1至3倍。少数贡献特别突出的，可适当高一些，或经职工讨论，当地人民政府批准，给予一定数量的一次性奖励。完不成承包合同的，应扣减经营者的收入（包括抵押金），直至保留其基本工资的一半。企业经营者除工资、综合性生产奖和承包兑现收入外，不得再领取企业内部的各种专项奖，也不得接受下属单位的奖金等额外收入。风险抵押金不参与企业分配。
    山西省委、省政府指出，在反贪肃贿斗争中，要依法查处，排除一切阻力，但也要注意有利于生产，巩固行之有效的改革成果。对于在改革和建设中做出了突出贡献、群众拥护但犯有错误的人，只要不是触犯刑律，改正错误后，仍然可以在原岗位工作。
