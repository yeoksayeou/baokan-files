On the Blue Frontier
Guo Xiaoye

The collection "Nine Heavens Songbook" (compiled by the Political Department and Cultural Department of the Air Force, published by the PLA Literature and Art Publishing House) will have what kind of impact on readers, especially on the broad cadre and soldiers of the Air Force, how many people will like it, and how many works within it will be liked by everyone, still awaits verification. However, subjectively, the authors and editors of the lyrics and music have clearly shown their attitude.

Like the title of the book, the 90-plus songs included in this collection are all related to the azure sky filled with the light of the sun and moon. The songbook is divided into three parts. The first part consists of battle songs, including the Air Force march and songs of various Air Force units and personnel. Overall, these songs are characterized by a powerful and upright melody and a firm and rapid rhythm, reflecting the traditional spirit and contemporary character of the People's Air Force, which is based on revolutionary heroism and collectivism. They express the firm belief and broad-mindedness of the broad cadre and soldiers of the Air Force in building a Great Wall in the blue sky for the prosperity of China and the revitalization of the nation. This is consistent with the authors' creative attitude of facing the troops, delving into life, and writing songs for the soldiers.

All the works included in the collection are new songs on Air Force themes from the past three years. During these three years, the lyricists and composers of the Air Force, with a strong sense of responsibility and mission, have gone to Xinjiang, Guangxi, Suzhou, and Liaodong. They have visited airfields, barracks, border posts, islands, battlefields, and sentry posts, and through interviews, discussions, and visits, they have learned about the work, study, and life of the officers and soldiers, and further delved into their spiritual world, understanding their rough yet delicate, open yet secret, pure yet rich, optimistic yet sometimes slightly sad emotions. Familiarity with life means mastering oneself. Whether it is an old comrade in his late fifties who grew up drinking the water of the Yanhe River, or a young person in his prime who is emerging on the music scene, they all feel the vigorous vitality given by the fertile soil of life, and the impetus of the growing season. They feel that collective marches not only need to maintain the traditional grandeur but also need to strengthen the imagery and color in the lyrics and the melody and rhythm in the music, making them more aesthetically valuable; military life songs should not only inherit the bright and simple style but also delve deeper into the emotional connotations and enhance the artistic individuality. These understandings come from their sincere approach to the military camp and listening to the soldiers' hearts. When these understandings return to life in the form of works, they can quickly resonate in the hearts of the soldiers. The widely circulated "Soldiers of the Camp" is an example. In a military camp on the coast of Liaodong, it was late at night, but the lyricist Yan Su had no sign of fatigue. He was reminiscing about the things he had discussed with the soldiers during the day. He thought, these young soldiers are all great guys. They could have taken the path to becoming managers, factory directors, artists, or millionaires. They have lost many opportunities by enlisting, but they have their own perspective on gains and losses. They want to serve in the army with an open heart and hold their heads high. No one wants to be a "cowardly soldier" or a "bullied soldier." This is the spiritual image they have set for themselves in the new era. His emotions were surging and struggling. He picked up his pen and wrote the lyrics for "Soldiers of the Camp." He then went to find the composer Jiang Chunyang to discuss it. Jiang Chunyang recited it twice, clapped his hands, and composed the music for the lyrics in one breath. It was widely recognized by the cadre and soldiers of the troops.

May the "Nine Heavens Songbook" soar with the pilots in the nine skies, where the natural altitude also has a social yardstick.

    在蓝色疆土上
    郭晓晔
    《九天歌集》（空军政治部文化部编，解放军文艺出版社出版），在读者中尤其是在空军广大指战员中将产生怎样的影响，能得到多少人喜爱，或者其中有多少作品能得到大家喜爱，还有待检验。而在主观上，在词曲作者和编者方面，则切实地表明了他们的一种姿态。
    如同书名，收入这个集子的90余首歌曲，都与充盈着日月之光的蔚蓝色云天有关。歌集分三辑。第一辑为战歌性质的歌曲，包括空军进行曲，空军各兵种及各类人员歌。就整体上讲，这些歌曲以冲锋号角雄浑挺拔的旋律和坚实急速的节奏为基调，概括反映了人民空军以革命英雄主义和集体主义为筋骨的传统精神和时代气质，表达了空军广大指战员为了中华富强和民族振兴，用自己的血汗筑起蓝天长城的坚定信念和宽广胸怀。这是与作者坚持的面向部队，深入生活，为兵写歌的创作姿态相一致的。
    收入集子的作品全是近三年来空军题材的歌曲新作。在这三年中，空军的词曲作者怀着由强烈责任感和使命感所生的满腔热情，赴新疆、下广西、去苏南、趋辽东，深入机场、营房、边陲、海岛、阵地、哨卡，通过采访、座谈、参观等方式，了解干部战士工作、学习和生活情况，并进一步深入到他们的精神世界，体察他们粗犷而纤柔、坦露而隐秘、清纯而繁富、乐观而有时也不免带有的淡淡伤感的情绪。熟悉生活也就把握了自己。无论是年近花甲、喝延河水长大的老同志，还是正值英年、在歌坛上崭露头角的年轻人，他们都感到了生活沃壤所给予的旺盛生命力，感到了在生长季节的冲动。他们感到，集团性的进行曲不但要保持传统的豪壮气势，还要在歌词上加强形象和色彩，在曲调上加强旋律和节奏的变化，使其更具审美价值；部队生活歌曲既要继承明朗朴实的风格，又要深掘感情意蕴，增强艺术个性。这些认识源于他们真诚地贴近军营、倾听战士的心脉，而当这些认识以作品的形式回到生活，便能很快地在战士们的内心引起共鸣。流传甚广的《军营男子汉》的诞生就属一例。在辽东沿海的一座军营里，夜已深，词作者阎肃却没有丝毫倦意，他在回味白天同战士们聊天谈到的事情，他想，这些年轻战士都是些挺棒的小伙子，他们本来可能会走上通向经理、厂长、艺术家、万元户的道路，他们因当兵失去了很多机会，但他们有自己的得失观，他们当兵要当得心胸坦荡、扬眉吐气，谁也不甘当“窝囊兵”、“受气兵”，这就是在新时期他们为自己树立的精神形象。内心的感情在动荡、奔突，他一把握起笔，写下了《军营男子汉》的歌词，随后即去找作曲家姜春阳商议。姜春阳默诵了两遍，猛一击掌，一口气为歌词谱了曲。得到了部队指战员普遍的承认。
    愿《九天歌集》能同飞行员在九霄云天一道呼吸和逡巡，那里的自然高度也具有一种社会标尺的意义。
