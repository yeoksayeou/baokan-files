    Fujian Implements "Two Opens and One Supervision"

    Anti-Corruption Efforts Extend to Rural Areas and Enterprises

    FUZHOU, Nov. 27 (Xinhua) -- How to fundamentally ensure the cleanliness of party and government organs and effectively prevent the occurrence of corrupt behavior? Over the past year, Fujian Province has taken the approach of simultaneously cracking down on major cases and building anti-corruption institutions, achieving good results.

    In the past, due to the lack of transparency in the operations of party and government organs and public service departments, some departments and units, especially those with approval, allocation, and law enforcement powers, lacked necessary supervision and constraints. As a result, power-for-money exchanges and bribery often occurred. Since the second half of last year, Fujian Province has decided to first implement the anti-corruption institution-building pilot project, with "two opens and one supervision" (open the procedures and results of handling matters, and accept public supervision) as the main content, in departments and work links that are most closely related to the people, have the most complaints from the people, and are most prone to corrupt behaviors such as power-for-money exchanges and power-for-self gain. The pilot project will gradually be promoted to other departments in the province. At present, more than 4,000 pilot units in the province have established and publicized their own anti-corruption institutions, covering more than 140 projects, including agricultural loans, engineering bidding, business license issuance, and residential land use approval.

    Land use approval for housing construction is a hotspot for power and personal relationships. After the implementation of the open approval system, the phenomenon of officials building houses in violation of regulations and farmers illegally occupying arable land for housing construction has been quickly controlled. The long-standing problem of extravagant banquets, which was once difficult to curb, has been largely stopped under the anti-corruption efforts and public supervision. The reception expenses in various places have been reduced by 50-80% on average, and various regions and industries have emerged with good examples of refusing bribes and banquets, and upholding integrity.

    Under the mechanism of openness and supervision, the past phenomenon of "difficult to enter the door, difficult to see the face, and difficult to get things done" has been greatly reduced, and the relationship between the party and the people, and between officials and the people, has significantly improved.

    After more than a year of implementation, the coverage of Fujian Province's anti-corruption institution-building has been continuously expanded, the content has been continuously enriched, the institutions have been gradually standardized, and the efforts have been extended from various levels of party and government organs and public service units to rural areas and enterprises.

    福建推行“两公开一监督”
　　廉政建设正向农村和企业延伸
    本报福州11月27日电　记者江宝章报道：如何从根本上保证党政机关的廉洁，有效防止腐败行为的滋生？一年多来，福建省采取一手抓查处大案要案，一手抓廉政制度建设的做法，收到了良好效果。
    过去，由于党政机关和公用事业部门办事透明度不高，一些部门和单位，特别是对握有审批权、分配权、执法权的那些部门和单位的权力缺乏必要的监督和制约，以权谋私、索贿受贿常有发生。去年下半年以来，福建省决定在同群众关系最密切、群众意见最大、最容易诱发权钱交易、以权谋私等腐败行为的部门和工作环节，首先实行以“两公开一监督”（公开办事制度和结果，接受群众监督）为主要内容的廉政制度建设试点，并逐步向全省其他部门推广。目前，全省已有4000多个试点单位建立、公开了各自的廉政制度，内容涉及农业贷款、工程招标及工商办照、居民建房用地审批等140多个项目。
    建房用地审批是权力、人情角逐的热点之一。在审批公开制度制定后，干部违章违纪建房和农村滥占耕地建房的现象很快得到控制。一度屡禁不止的吃喝风，在廉政建设中和群众监督下，已被基本刹住，各地的接待费用普遍减少50—80％，各地区、各行业都涌现了一些拒贿赂、拒吃请，廉洁奉公的好典型。在公开、监督的机制下，过去那种“门难进、脸难看、事难办”的现象大为减少，党群、干群关系明显改善。
    经过一年多的实施，目前福建省的廉政制度建设覆盖面不断扩大，内容不断充实，制度逐步规范，并从各级党政机关和公用事业单位逐步向广大农村和企业延伸。
