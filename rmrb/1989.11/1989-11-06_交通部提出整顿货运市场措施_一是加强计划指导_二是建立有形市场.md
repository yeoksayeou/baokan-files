The Ministry of Transport has proposed measures to rectify the freight market, emphasizing the strengthening of planned guidance and the establishment of physical markets.

Our reporter, Ji Xiaolei, reports from Beijing on November 5: The involvement of state-owned, collective, and individual transport capacities, along with the opening of the transport market, has injected vitality into China's transport industry. However, it has also led to serious disorder. At a recent national meeting on the rectification and management of road and waterway transport markets, the Ministry of Transport proposed a measure: during the rectification and management process, more emphasis should be placed on planned guidance to improve the organizational level of freight transport; at the same time, physical freight markets should be gradually established.

The Ministry of Transport clearly stated that different economic components of transport enterprises should have clear divisions of labor. The specific arrangements are as follows: emergency transport tasks such as disaster relief and military strategy, as well as urgent transport tasks related to the national economy and people's livelihoods, assigned by the people's governments at or above the county level, should be included in the mandatory plan and undertaken by state-owned transport enterprises. For important port and station distribution material transport determined by the provincial people's governments, and key material and seasonal large-scale material transport determined by the people's governments at or above the county level, a guidance plan should be implemented. This part of the materials will be tendered by the consignors, and contracts will be signed with the freight units to clarify the responsibilities of both parties and improve the transparency of freight transactions. In addition, small-batch but high-proportion scattered materials in the total freight volume will be included in the market adjustment range.

In response to the current widespread phenomena in the freight market such as monopoly of cargo sources, resale of cargo sources, price manipulation, and demanding kickbacks, the Ministry of Transport will promote the experience of "Freight Street" in cities such as Chengdu and Changchun in the near future, and establish physical freight markets in various places, allowing consignors and freight owners to enter the trading market together, where they can meet directly and choose each other. After the establishment of physical freight markets, the previously scattered operations and on-site transactions of individual transport operators will be brought under effective management mechanisms, and the chaotic situation is expected to be alleviated.

    交通部提出整顿货运市场措施
    一是加强计划指导　二是建立有形市场
    本报北京11月5日讯　记者季晓磊报道：国营集体个体运力一起上和运输市场的开放，给我国的运输行业带来了活力，同时也滋长了严重的混乱状况。交通部在最近召开的全国公路水路运输市场整顿治理工作会议上提出了一项措施：在治理整顿中，更多地强调计划指导，提高货运的组织化程度；同时，逐步建立有形的货运市场。
    交通部明确提出，不同经济成分运输企业的货运要有明确分工。具体安排是：将县级以上人民政府下达的抢险救灾、军事战略等紧急运输任务，以及关系到国计民生、要求紧迫的运输任务，列入指令性计划，交由国营运输企业承担。对省级人民政府确定的重要港站集散物资运输，县级以上人民政府确定的重点物资和季节性强的大宗物资运输，实行指导性计划。这部分物资由货主招标，同货运单位签订合同，明确承托责任，提高货运承揽交易透明度。除此之外，将批量不大、但在货运市场总运量中比重很大的零散物资，纳入市场调节范围。
    针对目前货运市场上普遍存在的垄断货源、倒卖货源、抬价压价、索取回扣等现象，交通部将在近期推广成都、长春等市“货运一条街”的经验，在各地建立有形的货运市场，让货主和东主一同进入交易市场，双方直接见面、相互选择。有形货运市场建立后，从前分散经营、随地交易的个体运输户将纳入了有效管理的机制中，混乱状况可望减轻。
