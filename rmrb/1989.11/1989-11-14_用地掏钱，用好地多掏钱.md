Xiamen, Fujian

Xiamen City is one of the cities approved by the State Council to pilot the paid transfer of state-owned land use rights. Since June 1988, 37 land plots have been transferred through public bidding and agreements, covering a total area of 430,000 square meters, and generating land price revenue of 118 million yuan. Among these, over 100,000 square meters were reclaimed from units that had been allocated land but did not use it within the specified period or had adjusted their land use.

The paid use of land has promoted the more scientific and rational allocation of urban land, fully reflecting the value and differential use of land. Using land requires payment, and using prime land requires more payment. The land plots in Xiamen that have been transferred through paid use have varying winning bid prices, with significant differences. Land plots near remote areas with poorer investment environments are priced at 500 to 700 yuan per square meter; those near the city center with more complete public infrastructure are priced at around 2,500 yuan per square meter; the highest land price is for plots in the city's bustling central area, reaching 3,468 yuan per square meter.

Currently, some prefabricated component production sites, warehouse lands, and low-efficiency simple factories in Xiamen are urgently seeking to transfer land for the construction of commercial housing or other high-yield projects. In old urban areas, some bustling but dilapidated and poorly planned sections have been signed over to foreign investors for large-scale renovations. On Gulangyu Island, some factories that are not in harmony with the scenic area are being relocated, and the original land is being repurposed.

The practice has shown that implementing the paid use of land use rights fundamentally overcomes the drawbacks of administrative land allocation. Issues such as unauthorized land use, unused allocated land, excessive land allocation, and the use of prime land for inferior purposes have become rare. It has also created significant revenue for the national treasury, paving a new way for "using land to support land" and "using land to support the city."

### 用地掏钱，用好地多掏钱

    用地掏钱，用好地多掏钱
    福建厦门市　吕文质
    厦门市是经国务院批准的进行国有土地使用权有偿出让的试点城市之一。1988年6月以来，以公开投标和协议的形式出让国有土地使用权共37幅地块，用地面积计43万平方米，获得地价款1.18亿元。其中有10多万平方米是收回用地单位征而超期未用或调整用地。
    土地有偿使用，促进了城市土地更科学、合理地配置，充分体现了土地的价值和级差使用。使用土地要掏钱，使用好地要多掏钱。厦门市土地使用权有偿出让的地块，中标地价不一，悬殊很大，靠近边远地带、投资环境较差的地块，每平方米500元至700元；靠近市区、公共基础设施较齐全的地块，每平方米为2500元左右；地价最高的是位于市中心繁华地带的地块，每平方米高达3468元。
    目前，厦门市一些构件预制场地、仓库用地以及效益很差的一些简易工厂，都迫切要求出让土地建商品房或其它效益高的建设项目；旧市区一些繁华而建筑物简陋破旧、建设布局不合理的地段，已与外商签订合同成片改造；鼓浪屿一些与风景区不相适应的工厂，也正在迁出，原来的土地被改为他用。
    事实证明，实行土地使用权有偿使用，从根本上克服了行政划拨用地的弊端；未征先用、征而不用、多征少用、好地劣用等严重浪费土地资源的情况少见了。它还为国家财政创造了可观的收入，为“以地养地”、“以地养城”走出了一条新的路子。
