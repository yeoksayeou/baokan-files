Today marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of Comrade Li Dazhao. The Central Party History Research Office, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party, Peking University, and other units are jointly holding a scholarly discussion on Li Dazhao to commemorate this major founder of the Party, a great Marxist, and a revolutionary of the proletariat. The discussion aims to explore the historical impact of Li Dazhao and his impact on history, and to learn from his steadfast stance, passionate heart, rigorous attitude, and noble character as a patriot, revolutionary, educator, scholar, writer, and intellectual. This is very meaningful. I represent the Central Party History Leading Group in warmly congratulating the convening of this scholarly discussion and extending cordial greetings to the domestic and foreign experts and scholars present.

Li Dazhao is a pioneer of the Chinese communist movement. He was the first to raise the banner of Marxism in China, actively participating in and guiding the May Fourth New Culture Movement and the May Fourth Patriotic Movement. He educated and united a large number of revolutionary youth, including Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, guiding them onto the path of communism. Later, he, along with Chen Duxiu, Mao Zedong, and others, initiated and founded the Communist Party of China. He was one of the Party's major early leaders. At that time, the ranks of the Chinese communist movement were still small, and the struggle environment was extremely harsh. For the sake of the lofty cause of communism, Li Dazhao vigorously opened up the front in workers, peasants, intellectuals, soldiers, and ethnic minorities, achieving remarkable results. He also actively assisted Sun Yat-sen in reorganizing the Kuomintang, implementing the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and developing the organization and work of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in 15 provinces and cities in the north. He continued to work in education and academia, using his earnings to support the revolutionary movement and assist poor students. On April 6, 1927, Li Dazhao was arrested by the warlord Zhang Zuolin. The reactionaries in the north hated him to the bone and advocated the harshest punishment. The traitor Chiang Kai-shek also telegraphed Zhang, "Execute the captured communists immediately to prevent future troubles." Thus, our great pioneer Li Dazhao was finally executed by hanging on April 28, at the age of 37 years and 6 months.

More than 60 years have passed since then, and our country has undergone tremendous and profound changes. The seeds of communist truth sown by Li Dazhao and others have grown, blossomed, and borne fruit on the soil of China. Of course, we are still in the primary stage of socialism; it is undoubtedly the starting point of communism, which is clear to both us and our enemies. Today, although we are far removed from the era in which he lived, we still feel the greatness of his short life, still feel the far-sightedness of his historical vision, the preciousness of his thought, and the sublimity of his revolutionary morality.

Since ancient times, China's outstanding intellectuals have had the tradition of caring about the fate of the nation. They took it upon themselves to advocate "worrying about the world before others do and enjoying after others do," and "the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every individual." Li Dazhao inherited and developed this tradition. At the age of 16 or 17, he felt deeply the urgency of the situation when the Russo-Japanese War used Chinese territory as the object and battlefield of contention, and the country was in dire straits, with the people suffering. He decided to change his name from Suinian to Dazhao and his courtesy name from Shouchang to Shouchang, which was a constant self-admonition to himself, not seeking longevity but seeking to be a lifelong fighter and principled gentleman. In his "Prison Memoir," he said: "Since I was a child, I have dedicated myself to the cause of national liberation, practicing what I believe in, and striving for what I know, regardless of whether it is a merit or a sin." His patriotism was characterized by his ardent love for the motherland combined with his genuine concern for the fate of the broad masses of the Chinese people. Among the early participants of the New Culture Movement, many used the idea of individual liberation to deny ethical principles such as the Three Bonds and Five Constants. They played an active role in the struggle against old morality and old culture, but they did not express deep sympathy for the deep and lasting suffering of the broad masses, nor did they express the necessary expectation for the revolutionary mobilization of the masses. Their point of attack and starting point in criticizing the old system were quite narrow. Li Dazhao was different. He was deeply saddened and worried about the dark reality of "farmers losing their land, workers losing their jobs, and merchants losing their sources." He stood up as a spokesman for the people to expose the harm of the old system and to engage in the struggle for change. He believed that "the dawn of light will depend on the will of our people and rely on the strength of our people to open it up." He had a strong hope and firm belief in the direct actions of the people.

Before the birth of the Communist Party of China, the advanced elements of China had tried to seek the truth of saving the country and the people from Western capitalist countries. Li Dazhao was also a sincere democrat, hoping to make China independent and strong through a bourgeois republic. From the standpoint of patriotism, going through democracy to communism was a common path taken by many advanced elements at that time. The question is, why was it not someone else, but Li Dazhao, who first abandoned the plan of building a country with capitalism and chose a new direction for socialism for China? I think this is directly related to the following two characteristics in his early thoughts. First, when choosing a path for China, he used whether it could lead to the happiness and liberation of the people as the standard for acceptance or rejection. He felt that after the establishment of the Republic of China, the name and reality were extremely inconsistent, "republic is a republic, but where is the happiness for our people!" After the outbreak of World War I, he examined the capitalist system of Western countries from the perspective of world history, pointing out that "this war has caused great doubts about the authority of European civilization. Europeans themselves also have to reflect on the true value of their civilization." Thus, even when he was a democrat, he had already adopted a certain attitude of doubt and reservation towards the plan of a bourgeois republic. In June 1916, he had said: "Representative politics are still in the experimental stage, and it is difficult to confirm whether they are good or bad, and it is also difficult to predict whether they will be preserved or changed." This skepticism, as Lenin pointed out in his evaluation of Herzen, is "a form of transformation from 'superclass' bourgeois democratic illusions to the unyielding, unyielding, and invincible class struggle of the proletariat." Second, his thoughts had relatively early elements of materialism and dialectics. He emphasized that people's cognition must be "based on facts," and when discussing and analyzing issues, "seek the true state of affairs." He believed that the universe is full of contradictions, and it is this contradiction that drives the change of things. From this point of view, he never clung to his own opinions. He believed that society is advancing, and new things will definitely be superior to old things. While expressing doubts about Western representative politics, he was convinced that the successor would definitely be a more superior system. It was precisely because of this that he was able to see, after the victory of the October Revolution, that this victory was the victory of the common people, the victory of Bolshevism, and that the rise of socialism was the trend of the times, believing that it would bring new hope for the national liberation of China. Although he was not the earliest to come into contact with Marxism in China, he was the first to draw a clear line between himself and bourgeois democracy, becoming the first Marxist in China.

As the earliest propagator of Marxism in China, Li Dazhao began to treat Marxism with a scientific attitude. First, he attached great importance to the study of the basic theories of Marxism, striving to fully grasp the theoretical system of Marxism, its revolutionary essence, and core. The article "My View on Marxism" introduced Marx's historical materialism, class struggle theory, and economic theory, which can be said to be the first relatively systematic introduction and propaganda of Marxism in China. The article pointed out that "the theory of class competition is like a golden thread," linking Marx's above-mentioned three major principles "from the root." Since the primary task of China at that time was to carry out the revolution, he particularly emphasized Marxism's historical materialism and class struggle theory, which was very natural.

Second, he initially suggested the idea that Marxism must be combined with Chinese reality. When he was still a democrat, he had spoken about the importance of correctly understanding the national conditions, believing that when considering China's problems, "we cannot ignore the national conditions." Here, the national conditions refer to both "the current national conditions" and "the historical national conditions," that is, history. He believed that this national conditions problem could not be sought from foreigners, "could not be discussed with foreign officials." In the early New Culture Movement, while exposing the contradictions between Confucianism and modern life, he did not take a completely negative attitude towards Chinese traditional culture. On the contrary, he was precisely an inheritor of the excellent traditional culture of China. He believed that Eastern civilization and Western civilization each had their strengths and weaknesses, and the construction of a new world civilization was not to completely Westernize, nor to completely negate Chinese traditions, but to "supplement the shortcomings of one's own with the strengths of the other." He had written articles opposing national nihilism and national pessimism, expressing his belief that "our nation can be revived and can make a second great contribution to world civilization." He examined Russian civilization from the perspective of world cultural development history, believing that it "truly combines the characteristics of Europe and Asia," and "in the future, the one who can create a new world civilization that combines the characteristics of Eastern and Western civilizations, the talents of European and Asian nations, is none other than the Russian people." This was also an important reason why he advocated welcoming the dawn of a new world civilization brought by the Russian October Revolution and advocating that the Chinese revolution should follow the path of the Russian people. After becoming a Marxist, he emphasized the practical application of Marxism in specific Chinese conditions, which not only showed his correct understanding of Marxism as a scientific worldview but was also a logical development of his thoughts. He pointed out that Marxism is "a product of an era." When we accept the theory of a certain scholar, "do not forget his era and our era." As a Marxist, one should study how Marxism theory "is applied to the political and economic situation of China today." The Marxist Theory Research Society he guided at Peking University organized a debate on "whether socialism is suitable for China" at that time, with him serving as the judge; they also carried out practical thematic studies such as "the actual situation of plundering by capitalist countries in the world, especially in China." He believed that socialism "has the possibility of adapting to reality," and when people "use it for practical movements," it will "change to adapt to the environment according to the time, place, and nature of the situation," that is, develop in the process of application. These thoughts are quite brilliant. In the early Marxist thought movement in China, he proposed these thoughts, which is even more precious. It is completely unreasonable to call these precious thoughts pragmatism.

Third, he believed that the greatest achievement of Marxism was to point out that "the realization of socialism, without the people themselves, is absolutely impossible." He not only valued the vanguard role of the working class in the revolution and directly engaged in the workers' movement but also valued the main force role of the peasants in the revolution and actively mobilized and organized peasant struggles. When he began to develop towards Marxism, he wrote an article "Youth and the Countryside," believing that only by turning the dark countryside into a bright countryside, the democracy of China would have a foundation and source, and therefore called on revolutionary youth to go to the countryside. Later, in articles such as "Land and Peasants," he made quite in-depth discussions on the position of peasants in the revolution and the necessity for revolutionaries to go to the countryside. He said that revolutionaries should care about the peasants who are "lying in the depths of suffering, waiting to be saved," and should "guide them out of this predicament and into the path of light." Some foreign scholars, based on this, believe that Li Dazhao and later Mao Zedong's thoughts have populist characteristics, and some domestic scholars also respond to this view. In fact, although Li Dazhao had once praised the Russian populists' slogan of "going to the people," he was different from the Russian populists in that he did not believe that peasants were natural socialists. If we consider that the Chinese revolution was first and foremost an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution, and the fundamental issue of the democratic revolution was precisely the peasant issue, then we should admit that Li Dazhao's concern for the peasants and his call for revolutionaries to go to the countryside were part of his efforts to correctly apply Marxism to the actual situation in China. The same is true for Mao Zedong.

Li Dazhao was originally a scholar. He was a revolutionary who explored the truth of saving the country and the people. After becoming a revolutionary, he devoted his main energy to the revolutionary struggle. He not only made fruitful explorations on major issues of the Chinese revolution using Marxism but also, in almost all fronts such as party organizational work, propaganda work, workers' movement, peasants' movement, united front work, military work, and ethnic minority work, his tireless figure was active, and he left brilliant achievements in the annals of history. From the beginning of the party-building activities to the final martyrdom, it was only seven or eight years. In such a short period, he made such great and multifaceted contributions to the Chinese people and the party's cause, which cannot but make one admire and respect.

However, as a revolutionary, Li Dazhao did not lose the character of a scholar. After the founding of the party, he continued to serve as a professor at Peking University, working hard in many fields of philosophy and social sciences. He was the first Marxist philosopher in China to use dialectical and historical materialism to observe, understand, and transform society, and he was also the founder of Chinese Marxist historiography, writing a series of historical theoretical works such as "Essays on Historiography." In other academic fields, he also did a lot of pioneering work. He was also a literary figure, writing many famous poems and essays. His writing style was upright, his pen was powerful, his arguments were sweeping, and his writings were full of passion. In the 1930s, Wang Senran wrote in the book "Evaluations of Twenty Modern Figures" that when he edited the magazine "New Youth," "with his bold and sharp pen, and sharp and powerful language, the spirit of the new literary world was greatly boosted." After his death, some of his manuscripts were collected and preserved by Li Lequan and others at the risk of their lives, and Zhou Jianren and others also collected his manuscripts in extremely difficult conditions. As a pioneer, his rough work in the field of thought and culture is natural, but his historical achievements in being the first to use Marxism to guide the revolution and occupy the philosophical and social science front are indelible. In 1933, Lu Xun wrote in the "Preface to the Complete Works of Shouchang" that all the collections of living and dead swindlers had collapsed, and even merchants "did not care about the capital" and only accepted them at a discount of two or three, but "his manuscripts will live forever, because this is the heritage of the pioneers, a monument in the history of revolution." Li Dazhao's integrity and conduct are very noble. In him, many virtues of the Chinese nation are condensed, embodying the excellent traditions of Chinese intellectuals. After he became a Marxist, all this was elevated and reached a new height. He was honest, kind, and simple, recognized by the scholarly community. At the same time, he had a very strong sense of principle. In times of danger, he never retreated but always stood up. When he was wanted by the enemy, his friends advised him to leave Beijing, but he insisted on staying for work. After being arrested, he not only kept the party's secrets in the face of the enemy's torture but also took full responsibility alone, trying to cover up and rescue the young people who were arrested at the same time. In prison for more than 20 days, he did not mention family matters at all. His martyrdom was very heroic, truly facing death with composure. He lived a frugal life and was very diligent. He used most of his income for the party's cause and to help others, to the extent that Peking University had to deduct a part of his salary in advance and hand it directly to his wife to prevent his family from starving. He "lived only to support his family, and after his death, he was as poor as a beggar, with his coffin, shroud, and clothes all provided by his friends." He was indeed a model in every way. Therefore, whether it was comrades, friends, or enemies, no one did not admire his character. Everyone who had contact with him gave him a very high evaluation. In the May Fourth period, there were already people who wrote poems praising him and Chen Duxiu as the "sun and moon" who "shine brightly in ancient and modern times," and Mao Zedong also said that they were "the most outstanding leaders in the intellectual circle at that time." After meeting Sun Yat-sen, Sun Yat-sen said that he was "his true revolutionary comrade," someone he "especially admired and respected." Some contemporaries also said that he was "a good friend with a kind heart," a "perfect man in modern China," and "regardless of his thoughts, actions, character, and treatment of friends and family, there is nothing to criticize."

Li Dazhao once personally wrote a couplet to give to a friend, which is "Shoulders of iron bear righteousness, hands of wonder write articles." The original author of this couplet is Yang Jisheng of the Ming Dynasty, with the original text being "Shoulders of iron bear righteousness, hands of spice write articles." Yang Jisheng was also from Hebei, a Jianying scholar, and once served as a secretary in the Ministry of War. He was imprisoned for impeaching the corrupt minister Shen Shixing, endured severe torture, and was killed. He was a famous scholar of the Ming Dynasty. Li Dazhao specially chose this couplet, which showed his admiration for Yang Jisheng and other ancient gentlemen. He changed the original "spice" to "wonder," which also made the couplet more meaningful. This couplet can be said to be a vivid summary and true portrayal of Li Dazhao's life. Someone borrowed this couplet to call Li Dazhao the "model of morality and literature," and he is indeed worthy of the title. In 1933, six years after Li Dazhao's martyrdom, his lifelong friend, Peking University professor Wang Lie, He Qi Hong, Shen Yinmo, Shen Jianshi, Zhou Zuoren, Hu Shi, Ma Yuzhao, Ma Heng, Fu Sinian, Jiang Menglin, Fan Jichang, Liu Fu, Qian Xuan Tong, and others raised funds to erect a monument for this hero. Liu Fu wrote the inscription for the monument, praising Li Dazhao as "righteous and meticulous, far-sighted and profound, and those who see him praise him." "Kind and generous, strict with oneself, sincere with others, diligent in learning, tireless in teaching, and thus attracting many followers, with a name that spread throughout the country." This shows that among scholars, regardless of their attitude towards Marxism, they could not help but admit the greatness of Li Dazhao's thoughts and character.

Today, we commemorate Li Dazhao to learn from his revolutionary spirit and noble character, his integrity, honesty, selflessness, and perseverance. We should inherit and develop his intellectual legacy, drawing strength from it. In the new period of building socialism, under the historical conditions of reform and opening up, it is especially important to develop both material and spiritual civilization and to firmly resist the subversive and transformative ambitions of capitalist powers.

Here, I would like to point out that the name of the communist pioneer Li Dazhao is inseparable from Peking University. His revolutionary activities began at the "Red Building" and the library of Peking University. The Marxist Theory Research Society he guided at Peking University initially received the support of the university president Cai Yuanpei. The "Kangmuyi Studio" (i.e., the Communist Studio) named by Li Dazhao and his students was two rooms specially provided by Cai Yuanpei for the research society as an activity venue. Many revolutionary youth who later became communists in China were members or corresponding members of this research society. Most of the initial members of the Beijing Communist Group were students and teachers of Peking University. Thus, Peking University not only has the great tradition of the patriotic democrat and educator Cai Yuanpei but also has the great tradition of the Marxist and revolutionary Li Dazhao, and the tradition of researching and propagating Marxism and forming one of the main birthplaces of communism. This tradition has shone brightly in the anti-Japanese and national salvation movements and in the anti-American and anti-Chiang struggles. After the founding of New China, Peking University has developed unprecedentedly, reaching new levels and scales in the teaching and research of natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. This process has also experienced some painful twists and turns. In any case, the glorious revolutionary tradition of Peking University is unshakable. Today, Peking University is one of the initiators of this scholarly discussion, and the discussion itself is held at Peking University, which is only natural. Whether in terms of historical status or current responsibility, I believe that the faculty and students of Peking University will, under the leadership and care of the Party and the government, firmly uphold and carry forward the revolutionary tradition established by Cai Yuanpei, Li Dazhao, and others.

For such an important historical figure as Li Dazhao, their history itself is a part of the Party's history. We should analyze them in connection with the historical environment at that time and make objective evaluations. The more we objectively evaluate the figures in the Party's history, the more we write out their thoughts, activities, and characteristics as they are, the more our Party history will be real, vivid, and convincing. In recent years, the study of Li Dazhao in the academic community has presented a thriving scene. I hope that this scholarly discussion will further deepen the study of Li Dazhao.

    纪念中国共产主义运动的伟大先驱李大钊
    胡乔木
    今天是李大钊同志100周年诞辰。中共中央党史研究室、中国社会科学院、中共北京市委、中共河北省委、北京大学等单位在这里联合举办李大钊学术讨论会，以纪念这位党的主要创建者之一，伟大的马克思主义者和无产阶级革命家，探讨历史对他和他对历史的影响，学习他作为爱国家、革命家、教育家、学者、作家和知识分子的坚定立场、热烈心肠、谨严态度和高风亮节，是很有意义的。我代表中共中央党史领导小组热烈祝贺这次学术讨论会的召开，并向到会的中外专家、学者表示亲切的问候。
    李大钊是中国共产主义运动的先驱。他最早在中国举起马克思主义的旗帜，积极参加和指导五四新文化运动和五四爱国运动，教育团结了包括毛泽东、周恩来等一大批革命青年，引导他们走上了共产主义的道路，随后与陈独秀、毛泽东等一起发起和创建了中国共产党。他是党的早期的主要领导人之一。当时，中国共产主义运动的队伍还很弱小，斗争环境非常艰苦。为了共产主义的崇高事业，李大钊在工人、农民、知识分子、军队官兵、少数民族等各条战线上奋力开拓，卓著成效；并积极协助孙中山改组国民党，实行国共合作，在北方15个省市发展了国民党和共产党的组织和工作。他也继续在教育和学术的岗位上耕耘不辍，而以所得的收入来支持革命运动，资助穷苦学生。1927年4月6日，李大钊被军阀张作霖逮捕。北方的反动派对李恨入骨髓，主张处以极刑，背叛后的蒋介石也密电张“将所捕党人即行处决，以免后患”。这样，我们的伟大先驱李大钊终于在4月28日被处绞刑，牺牲时年距38周岁还少6个月。
    从那时以来，60多年过去了，我们的国家已经发生了巨大而深刻的变化。李大钊等先驱播下的共产主义真理的种子，已经在中国的大地上生长、开花和结果了。当然我们还是处于社会主义初级阶段；毕竟毫无疑问，这是共产主义的起点，这对于我们和我们的敌人都是明白的。今天，我们虽然远离了他生活的时代，但依然感到他短促的生命的伟大，依然感到他的历史眼光的深远、思想价值的珍贵和革命道德的崇高。
    自古以来，中国的优秀知识分子就有关心国家命运的传统。他们以天下为己任，提倡“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”，
  “天下兴亡，匹夫有责”。李大钊是继承和发展了这个传统的。他在十六七岁时，痛感日俄战争以中国领土为争夺对象和战场，国势危急，生民涂炭，发愤献身救国事业。他决定改名耆年为大钊，改字寿昌为守常，就是自己对自己永恒鞭策，不求长寿，而求终身为奋斗不懈、坚持原则的志士仁人的表现。他在《狱中自述》中说：“钊自束发受书，即矢志努力于民族解放之事业，实践其所信，励行其所知，为功为罪，所不暇计。”①他的爱国思想的一个显著特点在于，他对祖国的炽烈的爱是同他对中国广大人民群众命运的真切关怀结合在一起的。前期新文化运动的参加者中，不少人以个性解放的思想来否定三纲五常这类伦理原则，他们在反对旧道德、旧文化的斗争中起过积极作用，但他们并没有对广大人民的深广而久远的痛苦表示深切的同情，没有对群众的革命发动表示应有的期待。他们攻击旧制度的立足点和出发点是相当狭隘的。李大钊则不同。他对“农失其田，工失其业，商失其源”的黑暗现实感到哀痛和忧虑②。他是以人民大众代言人的身份来揭发旧制度的祸害并投身于争取变革的斗争的。他认定，“光明缉熙之运，惟待吾民之意志造之，惟赖吾民之实力辟之”③。他对于人民群众的直接行动抱有强烈的希望和坚定的信念。
    在中国共产党出世以前，中国的先进分子曾经努力向西方资本主义国家寻求救国救民的真理。李大钊也曾经是一个真诚的民主主义者，希望通过资产阶级共和国，使中国走向独立和富强。从爱国的立场出发，经过民主主义而走向共产主义，这是当时许多先进分子所走过的共同的道路。问题在于，为什么不是别人，正是李大钊最早抛弃资本主义的建国方案并为中国选择社会主义新方向的呢？我想，这与他早期思想中的如下两个特点有直接的联系。其一，他在为中国选择道路时，是以它能否导致人民的幸福和解放为弃取标准的。他感到，辛亥以后所建立的民国，名实极不相符，“共和自共和，幸福何有于吾民也！”④第一次世界大战爆发后，他更从世界历史的角度来考察西方资本主义制度，指出“此次战争，使欧洲文明之权威大生疑念。欧人自己亦对于其文明之真价不得不加以反省”⑤。这样，即使在作为民主主义者的时候，他已经对资产阶级共和国的方案采取某种怀疑和保留的态度了。他在1916年6月曾说过：“代议政治虽今犹在试验之中，其良其否，难以确知，其存其易，亦未可测。”⑥这种怀疑论，正如列宁在评论赫尔岑时所指出的，乃是“从‘超阶级的’资产阶级民主主义幻想到无产阶级严峻的、不屈不挠的、不可战胜的阶级斗争的转化形式”⑦。其二，他的思想中较早地具有了唯物论和辩证法的因素。他强调，人们的认识必须“据乎事实”，论事析理，“求其真实之境”⑧；他认为，宇宙间充满着矛盾，正是这种矛盾的斗争推动着事物的变化。从这种观点出发，他从不固执成见。他相信社会是前进的，新事物肯定会比旧事物优胜。他在对西方代议政治表示怀疑的同时，就确信起而代之者必定是更为优胜的制度。正因为如此，他才能在十月革命胜利后独具慧眼，比同时代人更早地看到这个革命的胜利乃是庶民的胜利，布尔什维主义的胜利，看到社会主义的兴起乃是时代的潮流，认定它将带来中国民族解放的新希望。尽管他接触马克思主义在中国并不是最早的，但他最早同资产阶级民主主义划清界限，成了中国的第一个马克思主义者。
    作为马克思主义在中国的最早传播者，李大钊一开始就以科学的态度来对待马克思主义。
    首先，他重视马克思主义基础理论的研究，力求全面地把握马克思主义的理论体系，把握它的革命的实质和核心。《我的马克思主义观》一文就介绍了马克思的唯物史观、阶级斗争说和经济论，可以说是中国第一篇比较系统地介绍和宣传马克思主义的作品。文章指出，“阶级竞争说恰如一条金线”，把马克思的上述三大原理“从根本上联络起来”⑨。由于当时的中国，首要的任务是进行革命，他特别重视马克思主义的唯物史观和阶级斗争学说，是很自然的。
    其次，他初步提示了马克思主义必须同中国实际相结合的思想。当他还是一个民主主义者的时候，他就讲过正确认识中国国情的重要，认为考虑中国的问题，是不能“置吾国情于不顾”⑩的。这里的国情，既是指“近今之国情”，也是指“往昔之国情”，即历史?。他认为，这个国情问题，不可求于外人，“不可与客卿谋”?。在前期新文化运动中，他在揭露孔子之道与现代生活相矛盾的同时，并没有对中国的传统文化取全盘否定的态度。相反地，他正是中国传统的优秀文化的继承者。他认为东方文明与西方文明各有短长，建设世界的新文明，并不是要全盘西化，并不是要全盘否定中国传统，而应是东西文明各
  “以异派之所长补本身之所短”?。他曾著文反对民族虚无主义和民族悲观主义，表示“深信吾民族可以复活，可以于世界文明为第二次之大贡献”?。他从世界文化发展史的角度考察俄罗斯文明，认为它“实兼欧亚之特质而并有之”，“世界中将来能创造一兼东西文明特质，欧亚民族天才之世界的新文明者，盖舍俄罗斯人莫属。”?这也正是他主张对于俄国十月革命应“翘首以迎其世界的新文明之曙光”?，主张中国革命要走俄国人的路的一个重要原因。在他成为马克思主义者以后，重视马克思主义在中国具体情况下的实际运用，这不仅说明他对马克思主义这个科学世界观的正确理解，而且是他上述思想的合乎逻辑的发展。他指出，马克思主义“是一个时代的产物”?。我们接受某一学者的学说时，“不要忘了他的时代环境和我们的时代环境”?。作为一个马克思主义者，应当研究马克思主义理论“怎样应用于中国今日的政治经济情形”?。他指导的北京大学马克思学说研究会，当时就组织过“社会主义是否适合于中国”的辩论，并由他担任评判员；还开展过“世界资本主义国家在世界各弱小民族掠夺之实况——特别注意于中国”这类实际性的专题研究。他认为，社会主义“原有适应实际的可能性”?，当人们“用以为实际的运动”时，它会“因时、因所、因事的性质情形生一种适应环境的变化”?，即在运用中得到发展。应当说，这些思想，是相当精彩的。在中国早期马克思主义思想运动中，他就提出这些思想，更属难能可贵。把这种宝贵的思想说成实用主义，是完全没有道理的。
    再次，他认为马克思主义的绝大功绩，就是指明“社会主义的实现，离开人民本身，是万万作不到的”。?他不仅重视工人阶级在革命中的先锋作用，直接从事工人运动；而且重视农民在革命中的主力军作用，积极发动和组织农民斗争。在他开始向马克思主义方向发展时，他就写过《青年与农村》一文，认为只有把黑暗的农村变成光明的农村，中国的民主主义才算有了根柢和泉源，因而号召革命的青年到民间去、到农村去。后来，他在《土地与农民》等文中，更对农民在革命中的地位与革命者深入农村的必要性等作过相当深入的论述。他说过，革命者要关心水深火热中“倒卧着几千百万倒悬待解的农民”，要“去导引他们走出这个陷溺，转入光明的道路”。?国外很有些学者据此认为李大钊和后来的毛泽东的思想具有民粹主义色彩，国内也有人响应这种观点。事实上，李大钊尽管曾经赞赏俄国民粹派“到民间去”的口号，但与俄国的民粹派不同，他并没有认为农民是天然的社会主义者。如果考虑到中国革命首先是反帝反封建的民主革命，而民主革命的根本问题正是农民问题，那么，我们就应当承认，李大钊重视农民，号召革命者到农村去，这正是他为把马克思主义正确地运用于中国的实际所作的努力的一部分。毛泽东的情况也是如此。
    李大钊原本是一个学者。他是通过探索救国救民的真理走上革命道路的。当他成为一个革命者以后，他把自己的主要精力投入了革命斗争。他不仅运用马克思主义对中国革命的重大问题进行了富有成效的探索，而且，在党的组织工作和宣传工作、工人运动、农民运动、统一战线工作、军事工作、少数民族工作等几乎所有的战线上，都活跃着他的不知疲倦的身影，都留下了他的辉耀史册的业绩。从开始进行建党活动到最后牺牲，仅只七八年的时间。在这样短暂的时间里，他竟然为中国人民、为党的事业作出了那么巨大的、多方面的贡献，这不能不令人惊叹和感佩。
    但是，作为革命家的李大钊，仍然不失学者的本色。建党以后，他还一直担任北京大学的教授，在哲学、社会科学的许多领域里进行着辛勤的劳作。他是中国第一个运用辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义观察社会、认识社会和改造社会的马克思主义哲学家，又是中国马克思主义史学的奠基人，写过《史学要论》等一系列历史理论著作。在其它学科领域，他也作了不少开创性的工作。他还是一个文学家，写了很多脍炙人口的诗文。他的文章风格挺拔，笔力雄健，议论纵横，充满激情。王森然在30年代写的《近代二十家评传》一书便说，他编辑《新青年》杂志时，“以矫激之笔致，犀利之文词，中国新文坛气势为之大昂”?。他去世后，一部分遗文被李乐光等冒着生命危险收集并保存下来，周建人等也在极端困难的情况下进行着他的遗文的收集工作。作为一个拓荒者，他在思想文化领域中所进行的一些草创性工作自然不免粗糙，然而他在中国第一个用马克思主义指导革命和占领哲学、社会科学阵地的历史功绩，是不可磨灭的。1933年，鲁迅在《〈守常全集〉题记》中就说过，一切死的和活的骗子的一迭迭集子，已在倒塌下来，连商人也“不顾血本”的只收二三折了，然而“他的遗文却将永住，因为这是先驱者的遗产，革命史上的丰碑”?。
    李大钊的气节和操守是非常崇高的。在他的身上，凝结着中华民族的许多美德，体现着中国知识分子的优秀传统。在他成为马克思主义者以后，这一切更得到了升华，达到了新的高度。他为人忠厚、谦和、质朴，为士林所公认。同时，他又有很强的原则性。在危急关头，从不退避，总是挺身而出。在遭敌人通缉时，亲友们曾劝他离开北京，他为了工作，坚持留下。被捕以后，面对敌人的酷刑，他不仅严守党的秘密，而且独力承担全部责任，竭力掩护和解救同时被捕的青年。在狱20余日，绝口不提家事。他的牺牲是很壮烈的，真正是从容就义，视死如归。他一生自奉俭约，生活刻苦。他把大部分收入用于党的事业，用于接济他人，以至北京大学发薪水时不得不预先扣下一部分直接交于他的夫人，以免他的家庭断炊。他“生时仅可供家食，殁后则一贫若洗，棺椁衣衾，皆为友助。”?他确实处处可以为人之楷模。正因为如此，不管是同志、朋友还是敌人，对他的人品，没有不佩服的。凡是与他接触过的人，都给予他极高的评价。在五四时期，即有人写诗赞扬他与陈独秀是“双悬照古今”的“日月”?，毛泽东也说他们“两人都是当时中国知识界最出色的领导人”?。他与孙中山接触后，孙中山说他“是他的真正的革命同志”，是他“特别钦佩和尊敬”?的人。一些同时代人也说他是“宅心长厚之良友”?，是“现代中国的一个完人”，“不论他的思想，他的行动，他的为人，他的待友处家，都是无可訾议的”?。
    李大钊曾亲笔书写过一幅对联送给友人，就是“铁肩担道义，妙手著文章”。这幅对联的原作者是明朝的杨继盛，原文是
  “铁肩担道义，辣手著文章”?。杨继盛也是河北人，嘉靖进士，曾任兵部员外郎，因弹劾奸相严嵩下狱，受尽酷刑后被杀，是明朝的著名志士。李大钊特地选择这幅对联，说明了他对杨继盛等古代仁人志士的景仰。他将原联中的“辣”字改为“妙”字，也使这幅对联别具韵味。这幅对联，可以说是李大钊一生的生动概括和真实写照。有人借这幅对联把李大钊称为“道德文章之楷模”，他确是当之无愧。1933年，即在李大钊就义6年后，他的生前好友，北京大学教授王烈、何基鸿、沈尹默、沈兼士、周作人、胡适、马裕藻、马衡、傅斯年、蒋梦麟、樊际昌、刘复、钱玄同等，为公葬这位英烈募资立碑。刘复撰写的碑文称李大钊“理致谨严，思度宏远，见者称道”；“温良长厚，处己以约，接物以诚，为学不疲，诲人不倦，是以从游日众，名满域中”。这说明在学者当中，无论对马克思主义的态度如何，都不能不承认李大钊的思想和人格的伟大。
    我们今天纪念李大钊，要学习他的革命气概和高尚品质，学习他的一身正气，两袖清风，大公无私，自强不息，继承和发展他的思想遗产，从中汲取强大的精神力量。在建设社会主义的新时期，在改革开放的历史条件下，为了同时发展物质文明和精神文明，为了与资本主义列强对我颠覆演变的野心坚决周旋到底，这是尤其重要的。
    这里我想指出，共产主义先驱李大钊的名字是与北京大学分不开的。他的革命活动是从北大的“红楼”、北大图书馆开始的。他在北大指导的马克思学说研究会一开始就得到了校长蔡元培的支持。被李大钊和他的学生们定名的“亢慕义斋”（即共产主义斋），就是蔡元培为研究会专门提供作为活动场所的两间房子。当时国内后来成为共产主义者的革命青年，很多都是这个研究会的会员或通讯会员。北京共产主义小组的最初成员，大多数也是北大的学生和教师。可见，北京大学不仅有伟大的爱国民主主义者和教育家蔡元培的传统，而且有伟大的马克思主义者和革命家李大钊的传统，有研究和宣传马克思主义、形成共产主义主要发祥地之一的传统。这个传统在抗日救亡运动中，在抗美反蒋斗争中，都曾发出过夺目的光辉。新中国成立以后，北京大学得到空前的发展，在自然科学、社会科学、人文学科的教学和科研方面都达到新的规模和水平。这之间也经历了一些令人痛心的曲折。无论如何，北京大学的光荣革命传统是不可动摇的。今天，北京大学成为举办这次学术讨论会的发起单位之一，讨论会本身就在北京大学举行，是理所当然的。无论就历史地位和现实责任说，我相信，北京大学的师生今后一定会在党和政府的领导和关怀之下，把蔡元培、李大钊等创立的革命传统坚守不渝，发扬光大。
    像李大钊这样重要的历史人物，他们的历史本身，就是党的历史的一部分。我们应当联系当时的历史环境对他们进行实事求是的分析，作出客观的评价。我们越是实事求是地评价党史上的人物，越是如实地写出他们的思想、活动及其特点，我们的党史就越是真实、生动，越是具有说服力和感染力。近年来，史学界对李大钊的研究呈现出一派蓬勃兴旺的景象。我希望，这次学术讨论会将会把对李大钊的研究进一步引向深入。注：①《李大钊文集》（下），第893页。
