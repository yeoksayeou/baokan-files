	Someone Recognizes the Straw Sandals and Broken Bowl
		Shen Dalì

		The monk Su Manshu had a life full of unspeakable hardships and died young, his remains buried on the shady side of Solitary Hill. Today, when people stroll by West Lake, they can still see his tomb tower hidden among the overgrown grass.

		Su Manshu had no intention of becoming famous through his poetry and prose. Moreover, most of his manuscripts were lost during his lifetime. Once he passed away, it seemed as if he had vanished without a trace, fulfilling his own lament, "No one recognizes the straw sandals and broken bowl." However, things in the world often come full circle. The poet Liu Yazi of the Southern Society once responded to Su Manshu's poem "When will I return to see the tides of Zhejiang?" with the lines, "In the vast sea of emotions, the tides rise on their own."

		In recent years, some enlightened individuals in the West have been studying Su Manshu, and we have heard the echoes of his "tides" returning from afar. For example, the French comparative literature scholar Aidan Fu, who recently won the "Balsan Prize," affirms that "Master Su Manshu's works contain deep humanism, establishing a value system that allows people to despise the consumer society that first ravaged America and then corrupted Europe." Based on this, Aidan Fu specially requested that Dong Chun translate Su Manshu's major literary works. Thus, following the Chinese literary giants Li Bai, Pu Songling, and Lu Xun, Master Su Manshu entered the "Eastern Knowledge Library" compiled by UNESCO and the Gallimard Publishing House in Paris. His six famous short stories, titled "Tears of the Horizon" in total, met with a wide readership in French-speaking countries, sparking a series of thought-provoking responses.

		The "Eastern Knowledge Library" commented: "As a poet, Su Manshu belongs to the type who wanders freely, cherishes his own independence and that of the people, and is meticulous in his art."

		The French newspaper "Le Monde" published an article: "Su Manshu inherited the lofty spirit of Li Bai, with a broad mind, disdaining money, and possessing a rebellious character." It also said, "He seems to flow like clouds and water, but he is not unaware of the smoke of the world, always paying attention to the struggles, shocks, and fights of society, using his entire art to criticize, express indignation and despair. His language is concise, his writing is smooth, sometimes it takes shape, sometimes it is an illusion. It becomes a series of sketches, paintings, and ink paintings."

		In an article about "Tears of the Horizon," the author Gilbert Soufre particularly emphasized Su Manshu's thoughts expressed through the female protagonist Lianpei in "The Broken Hairpin": "If it were America, I would not want to go, and there are no historical records to rely on, and its people consider making money as the most important thing, often saying: 'Two dollars are better than one dollar.'" Gilbert Soufre asserted: "Master Su Manshu's words about American society clearly expose those greedy, money-grubbing misers."

		Indeed, upon reading "The Broken Hairpin," readers will see that Su Manshu, 80 years ago, already made a scathing mockery of the American capitalist pursuit of profit: "People say that America has material civilization, but they do not know that the misers there are using material civilization to make the common people increasingly poor. Therefore, those who advocate for humanity say: 'If the air on earth could be bought, it would have been absorbed by them long ago.'" It is evident that Su Manshu strongly opposed exploitation and oppression, particularly detesting the American money-worshipping society, calling it a "malicious organization" that suppresses the poor.

		In the preface to the French version of "Tears of the Horizon," Aidan Fu emphasized Su Manshu's philosophy that spiritual happiness is far richer and more enduring than physical pleasure, advocating "drinking from the Yellow Spring," just as Mencius said: "The earthworm eats dry soil and drinks from the Yellow Spring," vividly revealing that the Western world, which believes in materialism, is suffocating under the dust of consumption, yearning to breathe fresh air from Eastern civilization and refresh their spirits.

		During my stay in Paris this year, I chatted with some French friends about Su Manshu and found that they greatly admired this Chinese poet-monk who expressed deep emotions and sang naturally. At the same time, they praised him for his proficiency in French, English, Japanese, and Sanskrit, and for being the first to introduce Byron, Shelley, Burns, Goethe, and Kalidasa's poetry to the Chinese people, serving as a "bridge" for the exchange of Eastern and Western cultures in modern times.

		In this regard, Gilbert Soufre noted that Su Manshu "coldly observed the Westernization trend of Chinese youth," believing that while he was adopting the best from the West, seeking innovative strength from the French Revolution and British Romanticism, he never forgot to "revive the voice of the Han people." Moreover, he saw through the "hidden intentions" of the Jesuits in Europe and America, "seeking to destroy people's countries," spitting on that group of "traitors" who "considered others' ancestors as their own," seeking favor in a foreign land at the right time.

		Zhang Taiyan praised Master Su Manshu as a "man of high virtue, defying the clouds," a "lone wanderer." Looking back, Su Manshu had indeed stayed at the White Cloud Temple by West Lake, like a white crane in the clouds, living a pure life.

		The crane has vanished, and the bowl is full of fallen flowers. However, when the tears of the horizon become tides, Master Su Manshu had long since dreamt away in Luofu.

		Indeed: "When I return, the people are gone, who will pick the lotus flowers by the river?"

    芒鞋破钵有人识
    沈大力
    苏曼殊法师，身世有难言之隐，英年早逝，埋骨于孤山之阴。今人去西湖畔漫步，可见他的墓塔仍在宿草中隐逸。
    曼殊法师本无意以诗文传世，且其生时文稿已多散失，一旦寂灭，也就人去声息，似乎应了自己“芒鞋破钵无人识”的嗟叹。然则，天下事如往而复，南社柳亚子曾酬和曼殊“何时归看浙江潮”的诗句，曰：“微茫情海自生潮”。
    近年来，西方一些有识之士在研究苏曼殊，让我们听到了异域折回的“潮音”。譬如，新近获“巴尔桑奖”的法国比较文学家艾田蒲肯定，“曼殊大师的作品蕴含着深沉的人道主义，确认了一种价值体系，让人蔑视那个先肆行于美国，后腐蚀了欧洲的消费社会。”基于这一点，艾氏特请董纯女士翻译了苏曼殊的主要文学作品。这样，继李白、蒲松龄、鲁迅等中国文豪之后，曼殊上人进了联合国教科文组织与巴黎伽利玛尔出版社合辑的“东方知识文库”，其六篇小说名作以《天涯红泪》为总题目，与法语国家广大读者见面，引起了一连串发人深省的反响。
      “东方知识文库”评论道：“作为墨客，苏曼殊属于那种优游物外，珍惜自身及民众的独立，而在艺术上一丝不苟的诗人。”
    法国《世界报》载文：“苏曼殊远承李白高风，襟怀洒落，漠视金钱，具有叛逆的性格。”又说，“他似行云流水，但并非不见人间烟火，而始终关注社会的撕扯、惊悸和搏斗，用自己的整个艺术来抨击，表达激愤和绝望，其语言洗练，文字朗润，时而显形，时而幻影。化成了一幅幅素描、彩绘和水墨画。”
    在一篇关于《天涯红泪》的论文中，作者吉贝尔·苏弗莱特别重视苏曼殊通过《碎簪记》女主人公莲佩表达的思想：“若美洲，吾不愿往，且无史迹可资凭睇，而其人民以赚钱为要义，常曰：‘两美元总比一美元强。’”吉贝尔断言：“曼殊法师对美国社会的这番话，毫不含糊地揭露了那些贪利的，一心想发迹的守财奴。”
    确实，翻开《碎簪记》，读者就会看到苏曼殊在80年前已对孳孳为利的美国资本主义进行了辛辣的嘲讽：“人谓美国物质文明，不知彼守财奴，正思利用物质文明，而使平民日趋于贫。故倡人道者有言曰：‘使大地空气而能买者，早为彼辈吸收尽矣。’”足见，苏曼殊激烈反对剥削与压迫，尤其憎恨美国的拜金社会，称其为“压抑贫民”的“恶组织”。
    在《天涯红泪》法文版序言里，艾田蒲强调苏曼殊关于精神幸福远比肉欲痉挛丰富和恒久的哲理，倡导“饮于黄泉”，恰如孟子所云：“蚓上食槁壤，下饮黄泉”，形象地坦露了信奉唯“物”主义的西方世界被消费尘埃埋得透不过气来，渴望从东方文明里呼吸新鲜空气，一爽精神。
    今年逗留巴黎时，我跟一些法国友人闲谈苏曼殊，发现他们十分钦佩这位寄兴深微，自鸣天籁的中国诗僧，同时称道他通晓法、英、日和梵文，最早向中国人介绍了拜伦、雪莱，翻译了彭斯、哥德和迦梨陀娑的诗歌，是一座近代东西文化交流的“天桥”。
    在这方面，吉贝尔·苏弗莱注意到苏曼殊“冷眼看待中国青年的西化倾向”，认为他在向西方采取它山之石，在从法国大革命和英国浪漫主义里寻求革新之力的过程中，从不忘“振大汉之天声”，而且看穿了欧美耶稣会之铮铮者
  “包藏祸心，思墟人国”，唾弃那群“以别人之祖宗为祖宗”，企求在异邦乘时得宠的西崽。
    章太炎称赞曼殊大师是一位“厉高节，抗浮云”的“独行之士”。回首前尘，曼殊确曾栖身西湖白云庵，宛若云中白鹤，度过了洁白的一生。
    云鹤已杳，满钵落花。然天涯红泪成潮之际，曼殊上人已梦逝罗浮久矣。
    正是：“我再来时人已去，涉江谁为采芙蓉？”
