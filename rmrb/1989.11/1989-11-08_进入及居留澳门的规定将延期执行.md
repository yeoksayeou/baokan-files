Xinhua News Agency, Macau, November 7th.

The Macau government has decided to further postpone the implementation of the "Regulations on Entering, Staying, and Residing in Macau."

The November 6th issue of the "Macau Government Gazette" published an ordinance signed by Governor Carlos D'Assumpção, announcing this decision.

The ordinance states that to better align the "Regulations on Entering, Staying, and Residing in Macau" with local needs, after consulting with the Advisory Council, the implementation date has been extended to January 31, 1990.

This is the third time the regulations have been postponed. The "Regulations on Entering, Staying, and Residing in Macau" were announced on May 2 of this year, originally scheduled to take effect on July 2. After the regulations were announced, five major economic groups, including the Macau General Chamber of Commerce, as well as the Macau General Union of Neighborhood Associations and the Macau General Union of Trade Unions, raised objections to some of the provisions, requesting that the authorities postpone implementation, gather more opinions, and make revisions.
