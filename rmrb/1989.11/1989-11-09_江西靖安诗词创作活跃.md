Poetry and word composition in Jian'an County, Jiangxi Province, is exceptionally vibrant. Out of the county's fourteen townships, thirteen have established poetry societies and published their own periodicals. Poetry and word composition have become the most distinctive form of mass cultural activity in the area.

Jian'an County is the hometown of Tang Dynasty poet Liu Shenzhi and has long had a tradition of poetry and word composition, which has become even more popular in recent years. People use poetry to make friends and express their aspirations, creating a scene where "poetry friends fill Jian'an as one traverses the countryside paths."

The county has three individuals who are members of the Chinese Poetry and Word Composition Society, and more than twenty people have joined the Jiangxi Poetry Society. The county's Shuixi Poetry Society has also established a sister relationship with the Overseas Chinese Poetry Society in New York, USA.

    江西靖安诗词创作活跃
    据新华社南昌十一月八日电  （通讯员王晖、李新科）江西省靖安县格律诗词创作空前活跃，全县十四个乡镇就有十三个成立了诗社，并出版自己编印的刊物。诗词创作已成为当地最富特色的群众文化活动。
    靖安县是唐代诗人刘慎虚的故乡，一直就有作诗填词的风气，近年来更加兴盛。人们借诗会友，以诗言志，出现了“踏遍山乡路，诗朋满靖安”的景象。
    这个县有三人成为中华诗词学会的会员，二十多人加入了江西诗社。这个县的双溪诗社还与美国纽约的华人四海诗社结为姊妹关系。
