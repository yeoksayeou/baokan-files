This Corner Must Not Be Overlooked

On a Sunday, I had the leisure to visit an old classmate and saw him reading a newly published magazine with a nude woman on the cover and a title, "A Night of Ecstasy," which was appalling.

Only during our conversation did I learn that there is a corner that has been overlooked in the anti-pornography campaign. Recently, many factories, enterprises, schools, and government agencies have set up lending points in their clubs and libraries, primarily renting out books with pornographic content. Because these lending points are relatively "secret," they have escaped inspection time and time again. Since the anti-pornography campaign began, some people who can't find such books on street stalls have flocked to these lending points.

Some people have even made a fortune during the anti-pornography campaign!

    不可忽视这一角
    星期天得暇去看望一位老同学，见他正在看一本新出版的杂志，裸体女郎的封面，“销魂一夜”的内容，不堪入目。
    谈话中才得知有那么一角被“扫黄”忽视了。前一段，许多工厂及企事业单位、学校、机关团体的俱乐部、图书室里办起了以出租有色情内容的书目为主的租书点。因为它比较“保密”，漏掉了一次又一次的检查。“扫黄”开始后，一些人在街头巷尾的书摊上买不到了，都纷纷前往这些租书点。
    有的人竟在“扫黄”中发了财！
