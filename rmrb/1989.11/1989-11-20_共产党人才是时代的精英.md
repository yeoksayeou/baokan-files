Communists Are the Elite of the Times

Wang Maolin, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee

On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, the Shanxi North Yue Publishing House published the large-scale series "Contemporary Communists." After reading it, I am even more convinced that only communists are the elite of our times.

Not long ago, the theories of "elite politics" and "elite governance" emerged, using the banners of "deepening reform" and "accelerating the democratic process" to spread widely. Some who were praised and self-proclaimed as "elite of the times" either stepped onto the political stage, designing blueprints to turn socialist China into a dependent bourgeois republic; or worshipped the Western world, willingly becoming agents for the international monopoly bourgeoisie to implement the "peaceful evolution" strategy; or stirred up the public opinion arena, throwing out works like "River Elegy," openly advocating for wholesale Westernization; or lectured at university podiums, vying with our party for the young generation of intellectuals. During the political turmoil of this spring and summer, they all took the stage, performing a political farce aimed at overthrowing the party's leadership and changing the socialist nature of our country. The "elite's" performance was exposed to the Chinese people, and the nation increasingly saw that these "elite" were representatives of anti-party and anti-socialist forces, staunch advocates of bourgeois liberalization. Their "governance" was the path to the party's and the nation's destruction, the path to turning a bright China into a dark China.

Different classes, in order to achieve their social and political ideals, always need, call for, and cultivate elite figures from their own class. The proletariat is the most advanced class in human history, and the Communist Party is the vanguard organization of the proletariat, dedicated to serving the people wholeheartedly and representing the fundamental interests of the entire nation. Over the past half century, the Communist Party of China, with its lofty communist ideals and the scientific theories of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, has cultivated batch after batch of outstanding communists. It is they who, with their firm belief in communism, selfless dedication, tenacious and pioneering spirit, and highly inspiring and cohesive vanguard role, have led the people of the entire nation to achieve great victories in the new democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction. Outstanding communists, with their firm beliefs, lofty ideals, noble character, and outstanding achievements, have undeniably proven to history that they are the true representatives of the elite of the times, the backbone of the nation carrying the mission of revitalizing China.

Not long ago, when international and domestic reactionary forces colluded to stir up a wave of bourgeois liberalization, when the communist ideal that we communists have fought for all our lives was slandered as a "utopia," when someone, claiming to be a "patriotic scholar," fervently denied the great truth that "only socialism can save China," they always took communist ideals as their strong spiritual source, turning their patriotic passion for revitalizing China into actual actions to uphold the socialist direction and build the socialist cause. With selfless dedication and creative labor, they braved the difficulties, overcame obstacles, and achieved great feats. The renowned "Two Bombs and One Satellite" hero Deng Jiaxian, for example, was able to create the Chinese "extrapolation method" under extremely difficult conditions without any precedent or sufficient scientific experimental equipment, achieving successful simulated atomic bomb explosions. This led to the miracle of developing atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs in a time frame four years faster than the United States. This was because he, like many other intellectuals who love the party and socialism, firmly believed in the correct leadership of the party and the superiority of the socialist system, which could provide him with the opportunity to showcase his talents, ensure the full play of his intelligence, and truly realize the value of a communist's life in the great cause of building socialism. The other outstanding communists introduced in the series, whether it is the new-type socialist entrepreneur Zhou Guanwu, or the contemporary "Yugong" Li Shuangliang, listed among the "Global 500 Best" for environmental work in Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, or those who led the way in rural reforms, insisting on the path of collective prosperity, they all, in the great cause of building the four modernizations, added luster to our party, wrote new chapters, and won the praise of the people. The fundamental reason is that they, in the new situation of reform and opening up, never forgot the historical mission that a communist should bear, never forgot the political direction that a communist should uphold, and the socialist path that should be insisted on.

Communists are worthy of being called the elite of the times also because they are advanced elements armed with the advanced worldview and scientific theories of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. When the bourgeois liberalization trend was rampant, our party's guiding ideology—Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought—was attacked as outdated "doctrines," even slandered as religious superstition, they did not abandon the advanced worldview of Marxism and the epistemology and methodology of dialectical and historical materialism. Unlike those who treated Western bourgeois fashionable theories as the "Bible," they, while accepting some advanced science and technology and management experience from the West, did not blindly become captives of bourgeois ideology; unlike those who refused to accept new things and study new problems, they both adhered to the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and maintained and carried forward the spirit of daring to open up and innovate, the spirit of combining theory with practice and seeking truth from facts that our party has always advocated. They strove to use the worldview and methodology of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to seriously study new problems, explore new forms and methods of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and achieved remarkable results in creating a new situation and new experience in the construction of material and spiritual civilization in the great tide of reform and opening up.

When the decadent worldview, values, and ethics centered on individualism from the Western bourgeoisie, along with the tide of reform and opening up, surged in and eroded our social body; when the philosophy of money worship and hedonism, and the principles of commodity exchange infiltrated interpersonal relationships and party political life; when various forms of corruption began to spread within the party, there were many within the party who could maintain the essence of communists, not following the tide or mixing with the corrupt. The batch of communists introduced in the series can be said to be shining examples of self-cultivation, integrity, and public service. They served the people wholeheartedly, meticulously, and impeccably, consciously placing the interests of the state, the party, the people, and the collective above personal interests, worrying about the nation before enjoying personal happiness, and regarding "benefiting the world" as their code of conduct. They never viewed achievements and merits as capital for seeking fame and profit, nor did they trade power for money. Their noble moral character embodies the unyielding spirit of contemporary communists. They provide the best examples and most vivid teaching materials for eliminating corruption within the party, rectifying party style, strengthening party ideological construction, and establishing the party's lofty authority. At present, they also provide a great inspirational force for revitalizing the national spirit and promoting the national spirit of self-reliance and hard work. They let the entire party and the nation see that the party is full of hope, and the nation and the people are full of hope!

In summary, the reason why the contemporary communists showcased in this series are worthy of being called representatives of the elite of the times is mainly because they never forgot that they are communists. Comrade Chen Yun's handwritten inscription for this book: "Communists must never forget that they are communists!" is not only a profound summary of the book's theme but also a stern warning to all communists.

As a communist, after reading this series, I will take Comrade Chen Yun's inscription as my motto and encourage myself for life, and encourage all communists together. If every communist can be like the outstanding communists introduced in this book, always remembering that they are communists in every aspect and at every moment, our party will forever be the place where the elite of the times gather, the source of China's brightness, and the hope of the nation!

### 共产党人才是时代的精英

    共产党人才是时代的精英
    中共山西省委副书记　王茂林
    建国四十周年前夕，山西省北岳文艺出版社出版了《当代共产党人》大型丛书。读后更加确信，只有共产党人，才是我们时代的精英。
    曾几何时，“精英政治”、“精英治国”论嚣然而起，打着“深化改革”、“加速民主进程”的旗号广为流布。一些被吹捧为和自诩为“时代精英”的人，或跻身于政治舞台，设计着变社会主义中国为附庸性的资产阶级共和国的蓝图；或顶礼膜拜于西方世界，自愿充当国际垄断资产阶级推行“和平演变”战略的掮客；或鼓噪于舆论阵地，抛出“河殇”之类的“杰作”，公开宣扬全盘西化的主张；或鼓舌于大学讲坛，同我们党明争暗夺年轻一代的知识分子。今年春夏之交的政治动乱，他们纷纷粉墨登场，演出了一场旨在推翻党的领导，改变我国社会主义性质的政治闹剧。“精英”们的表演，在国人面前作了一次政治大“曝光”，全国人民越来越清楚地看到：这些“精英”，原来是反党反社会主义势力的代表，顽固推行资产阶级自由化的干将。他们的“治国”之道，就是亡党亡国之道，就是变光明的中国为黑暗的中国之道。
    不同的阶级为了实现自己的社会政治理想总是需要、召唤、培育本阶级的精英人物。无产阶级是人类历史上最先进的阶级，共产党是无产阶级的先锋队组织，是以全心全意为人民服务为宗旨、代表了全民族的根本利益的。半个多世纪以来，中国共产党以其崇高的共产主义理想和马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的科学理论培育了一批又一批的优秀共产党人。正是他们胸怀共产主义的坚定信念，坚持无私无畏的奉献精神，发扬坚韧不拔、开拓进取的风格，以极富感召力和凝聚力的先锋带头作用，带领全国人民取得了新民主主义革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。优秀共产党人，以其坚定的信念、崇高的理想、高尚的情操和卓越的业绩，无可争辩地向历史证明了他们才是真正体现历史前进方向的时代精英之代表，才是真正担负振兴中华的历史使命的民族脊梁之中坚。
    不久前，当国际国内的反动势力内外勾结掀起一股资产阶级自由化的汹涌浪潮的时候，当我们共产党人为之奋斗终身的共产主义理想被诬蔑为“乌托邦”的时候，当有人以“爱国的志士”自居，狂热否定“只有社会主义才能救中国”的伟大真理的时候，他们始终以共产主义的崇高理想为强大的精神源泉，将一腔振兴中华的爱国热情化为坚持社会主义方向、建设社会主义大业的实际行动，以无私的奉献和创造性的劳动，披荆斩棘，克服困难，建功立业。被誉为中国“两弹元勋”的邓稼先之所以能在无前人经验可循，无充分科学实验设备的艰难条件下创造出中国式“外推法”，取得模拟原子弹爆炸的成功经验，进而以比美国快四年多的速度创造出由原子弹到氢弹上天的奇迹，就是因为他和广大热爱党热爱社会主义的知识分子一样坚信党的正确领导和社会主义制度的优越性，可以为自己提供大显身手的机遇，可以保证自己聪明才智的充分发挥，可以在建设社会主义的伟大壮举中真正实现共产党人的人生价值。丛书所介绍的其他优秀共产党人，无论是新型的社会主义企业家周冠五，还是当代愚公，列入世界环保工作“全球500佳”的太原钢铁公司的李双良，或是那些在农村改革中坚持走集体富裕道路的带头人，他们在建设四化的大业中所以能为我们党增光添彩，谱写新章，获得人民的赞誉，根本的一条，就是他们在改革开放的新形势下，始终没有忘记共产党员所应肩负的历史使命，始终没有忘记共产党员所应认定的政治方向，所应坚持的社会主义道路。
    共产党人所以称得起是当代的精英，还在于他们是用马列主义和毛泽东思想的先进世界观和科学理论武装起来的先进分子。当资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥成灾，我们党的指导思想——马列主义、毛泽东思想被攻击为过时的“学说”，甚至被诬蔑为宗教迷信的时候，他们并没有放弃马列主义的先进世界观和辩证唯物主义、历史唯物主义的认识论、方法论。同那些把西方资产阶级的时髦学说奉为“圣经”的人相反，他们在接受西方某些先进科学技术和管理经验的同时，并没有盲目地沦为资产阶级意识形态的俘虏；同那些拒绝接受新事物、研究新问题的因循守旧者不同，他们既坚持了马列主义、毛泽东思想的基本原理，又保持和发扬了当代共产党人勇于开拓、勇于创新的精神，保持和发扬了我党一贯倡导的理论联系实际、实事求是的作风，力求用马列主义、毛泽东思想的世界观、方法论，认真研究新问题，探索建设有中国特色的社会主义的新形式、新方法，卓有成效地在改革开放的大潮中开创出物质文明和精神文明建设的新局面、新经验。
    当西方资产阶级以个人主义为核心的腐朽人生观、价值观、伦理观随着改革开放的浪潮汹涌而来、渗透和腐蚀着我们的社会肌体的时候；当拜金主义、享乐至上的市侩哲学和商品交换的原则侵蚀到人际关系和党的政治生活之中的时候；当各种腐败现象在党内滋生蔓延开来的时候，我们党内能够保持共产党人的本色，不随波逐流、同流合污的大有人在。丛书介绍的一批共产党员可以说无一不是洁身自好、清廉奉公的光辉典型。他们全心全意、一丝不苟、一尘不染地为人民服务，自觉地把国家利益、党的利益、人民的利益、集体的利益置于个人利益之上，“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”，把“利益归天下”奉为行为准则，从不把功劳和业绩视为争名夺利的资本，从不把权利与金钱作交易。他们崇高的道德情操，体现了当代共产党人的铮铮风骨。他们，为清除党内腐败现象、端正党风、加强党的思想建设、树立党的崇高威信，提供了最好的榜样，最生动的教材。在当前，对于振奋民族精神，弘扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的民族气概也提供了一种巨大的鼓舞力量。他们让全党全民看到，党是大有希望的，国家和民族是大有希望的！
    总之，这套丛书展示的当代共产党人之所以称得起是当代时代精英的代表，主要是由于他们始终没有忘记自己是个共产党员。陈云同志为这套书亲笔书写的题词：“共产党员始终不要忘记自己是个共产党员！”既是对本书题写的精辟概括，也是对全体共产党人的警策告诫。
    作为一个共产党人，读了这套丛书，我将以陈云同志的题词为座右铭，终身自勉，并与全体共产党人相互共勉。如果，我们每个共产党人能够像本书所介绍的优秀共产党人那样，时时刻刻、事事处处“始终不要忘记自己是个共产党员”，我们的党将会永远成为时代精英之所在，中华光明之所源，民族希望之所钟！
