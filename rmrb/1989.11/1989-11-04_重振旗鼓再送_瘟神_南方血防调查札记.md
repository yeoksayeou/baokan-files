**Revitalizing the Campaign to Send the "Plague" Packing Again**

**Field Notes from a Southern Blood Flukes Investigation**

The "small worm" disaster alarms Zhongnanhai

In early September this year, a letter from the public was transferred to General Secretary Jiang Zemin by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission. The letter reported an outbreak of acute blood fluke infections in Wuhan. Jiang Zemin, after reading it, immediately instructed: "In recent years, including the southern regions, there seems to be a resurgence of blood fluke disease. Please study and take necessary measures."

The voice from Zhongnanhai undoubtedly boosted the confidence and morale of the people in Wuhan and the broader southern epidemic areas to send the "plague" packing again. It is understood that the epidemic in the Wuhan area has been controlled, and more extensive and comprehensive prevention and treatment measures have been planned, which will gradually radiate to neighboring epidemic areas.

The echoes of history are strikingly similar. In the early days of the founding of New China, despite the many challenges and the heavy burden of state affairs, the cries for help from the people in the southern blood fluke epidemic areas still shook Zhongnanhai. The Party and the government regarded this "plague" as the "fourth mountain" oppressing hundreds of millions of people and actively launched a campaign to eradicate it.

With a grand vision, Chairman Mao Zedong called on the entire Party and the nation to "definitely eradicate blood fluke disease." In 1955, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting in Hangzhou and decided to establish the "Central Committee Leading Group for the Prevention and Treatment of Blood Fluke Disease," which was fully responsible for the blood fluke prevention work in the southern provinces.

To combat a "small worm," the Communist Party of China established a central-level organization, and this organization remained in place for 31 years. This is unprecedented in the world. But the Communist Party of China did it!

In March 1957, Chen Yun, as the Vice Chairman of the Party Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, personally inspected the blood fluke prevention work in Qingpu County, Shanghai, one of the ten major epidemic areas in the country. One month later, a directive titled "Instructions of the State Council on the Eradication of Blood Fluke Disease," drafted by Chen Yun and personally signed by Premier Zhou Enlai, was issued.

For a long period, blood fluke prevention work was regarded as a political task, from the central to the local levels, with hundreds of billions of yuan allocated to ensure its implementation.

We can proudly say that the blood fluke prevention work in New China has achieved—

**Globally Recognized Achievements**

The most notable successes came in the 1960s. Initially, counties and districts were targeted, and then the scope expanded to provinces and cities. The goal shifted from "basic eradication" to "eradication." By March 1989, China had declared that four provinces and municipalities—Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Shanghai—had achieved the standard of "eradication" of blood fluke disease across their entire territories. Out of 373 epidemic counties nationwide, 263 had reached the standards of "eradication" or "basic eradication."

Achieving success is difficult, and maintaining it is even harder. Fortunately, most of the areas that had sent the "plague" packing strictly monitored the epidemic situation, continued to focus on the final stages of the campaign, and, after decades, still firmly maintained the achievements of blood fluke prevention. Take Yujian County, for example. Two county committees insisted on the "four no" policy—no disbanding of organizations, no dispersal of teams, no reduction of personnel, and no cutting of funds—to ensure the achievement of the "two no" indicators: no new infected patients and no new epidemic areas. Over 31 years, Yujian County discovered residual snails 52 times in 35 snail-infested areas, although all were uninfected negative snails. The county committee still organized personnel to promptly exterminate them, preventing potential disasters.

However, amidst the clamor of "eradication," the blood flukes and their intermediate hosts, the snails, silently multiplied and spread. They hid in marshes, grasslands, mudflats, and reed roots, waiting for the opportunity to wreak havoc.

Many blood fluke prevention workers wrote to the media, calling on people to take action—

**To Send the "Plague" Packing Again, We Must Not Dismount**

Blood fluke expert Zhang Shaoji introduced that eradicating blood flukes and snails as biological species is not an easy task. The key lies in perseverance and continuous efforts.

According to materials provided by the Ministry of Health, the country currently has an area of 34.66 billion square meters infested with snails; there are 1 million blood fluke patients, including more than 40,000 late-stage severe patients; and over 100 million people are threatened by the disease.

On this "epidemic map," if we rank the resurgence of several epidemic indicators, Hubei Province would be at the top, followed by Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Zhejiang. In these provinces, the resurging blood fluke epidemic has become a shadow over the economic takeoff of the epidemic areas and a hidden danger to poverty alleviation and prosperity.

After tasting the bitter fruit of the "plague," Hubei Province seriously analyzed the causes. Party and government leaders took responsibility for the years of focusing on economic development and relaxing blood fluke prevention work, reminding the entire province that if they missed the opportunity again, the spreading epidemic would ultimately destroy the achievements of economic development. The Jianghan Plain gathered 500,000 laborers and hundreds of tractors, and the snail extermination army fought a brilliant "send the plague packing" battle.

Jiangxi and Anhui provinces corrected the situation where blood fluke prevention funds were "slashed" in recent years. Jiangxi Province Governor Wu Guanzheng and Vice Governor Chen Guiwen inspected the severely affected Poyang Lake area after the autumn floods last year. In a subsequent provincial governor's office meeting, it was decided that the 480 million yuan allocated for blood fluke prevention in 1989 would not be reduced by a single cent, and an additional 300 million yuan in special funds for blood fluke prevention would be allocated by the provincial finance department. Anhui Province increased its blood fluke prevention funds by 50 million yuan this year on top of the 150 million yuan from last year. Sending the "plague" packing again has the most solid financial guarantee.

Recently, the three-year comprehensive campaign to control blood fluke disease in the Poyang Lake region of Jiangxi Province has been launched, and it is not far for the lake area residents to completely get rid of the "plague."

The severely affected Hunan Province made legislative attempts to send the "plague" packing again. The province, in response to the general weakening of blood fluke prevention awareness among officials and the public in the epidemic areas, promptly promulgated the "Hunan Province Blood Fluke Disease Prevention and Treatment Management Regulations." The blood fluke prevention tasks were assigned to the governments of various levels in the epidemic areas and included in the performance evaluation of officials.

Various signs indicate that the blood fluke prevention work, which had "slipped" in recent years, is now recovering from its low point, and the spread of the epidemic will eventually be stopped.

Today, how to seize the opportunity of reform and quickly alleviate the blood fluke epidemic in the south is what the broad masses of blood fluke prevention workers are striving for. They are pondering—

**New Ideas for Blood Fluke Prevention Reform**

The era of reform does not allow and cannot allow everything to follow old practices. We need to broaden our horizons and find good strategies. A new approach that adapts to the reform situation and is full of vitality is taking shape.

First, establish a national blood fluke prevention fund and open blood fluke prevention insurance to concentrate social forces to support the blood fluke prevention cause.

Blood fluke prevention experts suggest that the national blood fluke prevention fund can be composed of the following parts: the operational funds that various ministries and commissions responsible for blood fluke prevention should contribute; the local financial input from provinces where blood fluke disease is prevalent; a portion of the revenue from production and business activities of various levels and types of blood fluke prevention research and prevention institutions nationwide; and donations from various social organizations, enterprises and institutions, and overseas individuals. This fund should be managed and allocated by the authoritative national blood fluke prevention agency, with dedicated funds for dedicated use.

The insurance sector can consider the fact that approximately 100 million people in China are threatened by blood flukes and open blood fluke prevention insurance. It is estimated that if each person pays 1 yuan per year, the premium would reach 100 million yuan. This approach is beneficial for both the country and the people.

Second, summarize and promote the successful experience of Anhui Province's pilot "replacing reeds with trees" snail extermination method. Experts introduced that this provides new experience for overcoming the difficulty of snail extermination in rivers, lakes, and marshes.

The experimental site for this new snail extermination method is in Xinzhou Township, Anqing City. In 1982, 13,600 mu of Italian poplar trees were planted on the Yangtze River beach, replacing the original reeds. These forest lands were all contracted to local residents, and the economic benefits of afforestation exceeded those of reeds by more than five times. The residents of Xinzhou Township were greatly encouraged and weeded out the sprouting reeds several times a year, changing the environment for snail breeding. It was determined that since 1982, the density of snails on the Yangtze River beach in Xinzhou Township has been gradually decreasing. In 1985, the rate of positive snails was zero, and in the past two years, not a single live snail has been found. The rate of positive stool examinations and the incidence of the disease among the residents have also significantly decreased. Vice Minister of Health He Jiexing and others, after inspecting the area, believed that the "Xinzhou experience" is worth promoting.

    重振旗鼓再送“瘟神”
    ——南方血防调查札记
    新华社记者　马雪松　骆国骏
    “小虫”之灾牵动中南海
    今年9月上旬，中央信访局转交的一封群众来信摆在了总书记江泽民的案头。信中反映武汉出现血吸虫病急性感染疫情，江泽民同志阅后当即批示：“前几年血吸虫病基本消灭，毛主席有送瘟神诗歌颂。近年来包括江南一带，似有复发之势。望研究，采取必要措施。”
    中南海的声音传到，无疑给武汉三镇乃至南方广大疫区人民平添二送“瘟神”的信心和斗志。据悉，武汉地区疫情已经控制，更大规模和范围的防治措施业已拟订，将逐步向毗邻疫区辐射。
    历史的闪回何其相似。新中国初创时期，尽管百废待兴、国事冗繁，可是，南方血吸虫病疫区群众给党中央写信，发出“救救我们”的呼声依然震撼了中南海。党和政府将这“瘟神”视为压迫亿万人民的“第四座大山”，积极开展除害灭病。
    伟人毛泽东以恢宏的气魄，号召全党、全国人民“一定要消灭血吸虫病”。1955年，中共中央政治局在杭州开会，决议成立“中共中央血吸虫病防治领导小组”，全权负责南方诸省血防工作。
    为一条“小虫”而由执政党专设一个中央级机构，而且机构一设就是31年，这在世界上恐怕没有先例。但是，中国共产党这么做了！
    陈云1957年3月以党中央副主席、国务院副总理的身份亲临全国10大重疫区之一的上海青浦县调查血防工作。事隔一月，由陈云负责起草、周恩来总理亲自签署的《国务院关于消灭血吸虫病的指示》就发表了。
    血防工作在相当长时期内被视为一项政治任务，从中央到地方，耗资上百亿元予以保证。
    我们可以毫无愧色地说，新中国的血防事业，已经取得——
    举世瞩目的成就
    捷报频传当数60年代之后。先是县区后扩大到省市，先是“基本消灭”后升格为“消灭”。截止1989年3月，我国已有闽、粤、桂、沪4个省市区宣布在全境达到“消灭”血吸虫病标准。全国373个流行县中，已有263个达到“消灭”或“基本消灭”标准。
  创业不易，守业更难。值得欣慰的是，绝大部分送走“瘟神”的地区严格进行疫情监测、继续狠抓扫尾工程，历经二三十年，仍然牢牢巩固住了血防成果。就拿余江县为例，两届县委坚持用“四不”政策——机构不撤、队伍不散、人员不减、经费不扣，保证了实现“两无”指标——无一例新感染病人、无一处新流行疫区。31年间，余江曾在35处螺点52次发现残螺，尽管都是未被感染的阴性钉螺。县委仍组织人力及时扑杀，防患于未然。
    但是，就在一片“消灭”声中，肉眼难察的血吸虫以及它的“中间宿主”钉螺又悄然孳生、繁衍，它们星散于湖滩、草洲，蛰伏于泥淖、芦根，伺机滥施淫威。
    许多血防人员纷纷投书新闻媒介，呼吁人们行动起来——
    再送“瘟神”不卸鞍
    血防专家张绍基介绍说，血吸虫、钉螺作为生物物种，要想灭绝并非易事，关键在于持之以恒、连续作战。
    据卫生部提供的材料，全国目前尚有钉螺面积34.66亿平方米；血吸虫病人100万，其中晚期重症患者有4万多人；受威胁人口超过1个亿。
    在这张“疫情图”上，如果把几项疫情指标回升状况排个座次的话，那么首推湖北省，次第而列的便是湘、赣、皖、苏、川、滇、浙。在这些省份，日益回升的血吸虫病疫情已经成为疫区经济腾飞的阴霾、治穷致富的隐患。
    湖北省在尝到了“瘟神”荼毒的苦果后，认真分析原因。党政领导自觉承担了这些年重视发展经济、放松血防工作的责任，并提醒全省上下，若再延误战机，蔓延的疫情最终将毁掉经济发展的成果。江汉平原上汇集50万劳力、数百辆拖拉机，灭螺大军打了一场漂亮的“送瘟神”之战。
    皖赣两省对于近些年血防经费被“刀削斧砍”的情况纠偏。江西省长吴官正、副省长陈癸尊去年秋汛后相继视察疫情严重的鄱阳湖区，此后的一次省长办公会议决定：1989年全省用于血防的480万元经费一分不准减，另由省财政一次性增拨300万元血防专款。安徽省今年血防经费在去年150万元的基础上又增加了50万元。再送“瘟神”有了最坚实的财力保障。
    最近，为期3年的江西鄱阳湖大区域控制血吸虫病总体战役已经打响，湖区群众彻底摆脱“瘟神”之灾为时不远了。
    疫情严重的湖南省为再送“瘟神”作了立法尝试。这个省针对疫区干部、群众血防意识普遍淡化现象，及时推出《湖南省血吸虫病防治管理条例》。把血防任务落实到疫区各级政府肩上，纳入干部政绩考评内容。
    种种迹象表明：前些年“滑坡”的血防工作正在走出低谷，遏止蔓延的疫情终将成为现实。
    今天，如何挟改革之春潮，尽快缓解南方的血吸虫病疫情，这是广大血防干部孜孜以求的。他们潜心琢磨着——
    血防改革的新思路
    改革的年代不允许也不可能事事因循旧例。拓宽视野谋良策，一条适应改革形势、充满生机活力的新思路正在形成。
    一是设立国家级血防基金、开设血防保险，集中社会力量为血防事业添薪加油。
    血防专家建议，国家级血防基金可以由如下部分构成：承担血防职责的各部委应投入的事业费；血吸虫病流行省份地方财政的投入；全国各级、各类血防科研、防治机构从其生产经营活动收益中上交一部分；发动、鼓励社会各团体、企事业单位以及海外人士捐赠一部分。该项基金要由国家掌管血防工作的权威机构统筹调度，专款专用。
    保险部门可以考虑我国约有1亿多人口受到血吸虫威胁这一严峻事实，开设血防保险。据测算，如果人均年投保1元，保费就达亿元。这样做，于国于民有利。
    二是总结推广安徽试点成功的“以林代芦”灭螺法。据专家介绍，这为攻克江、湖、洲“三滩”灭螺难关提供了新的经验。
    这项灭螺新法的试验点设在安庆市新洲乡。1982年，该乡长江滩涂陆续引种了1.36万亩意大利白杨取代原先的芦苇。这些林地全部划包给当地群众，造林的经济收益超过芦苇5倍以上。新洲乡群众大受鼓舞，每年数次铲除萌生的芦苇，改变钉螺孳生环境。据测定，1982年以来，新洲乡江滩钉螺密度逐年下降，1985年阳性钉螺率即为零，前年、去年两年已没有发现一枚活钉螺，群众粪检的阳性率和患病率也大幅度下降。卫生部副部长何界生等人到此考察后认为，“新洲经验”值得推广。
