Reporter Xiao Guan Gen reports from Shanghai: The Liu Garden of the Chinese Hotel in Tokyo has been "relocated" to Shanghai, and the opening ceremony was held yesterday. It was donated by a patriotic overseas Chinese in Japan, Shanghai Jiaotong University founder Shen Xuanhuai's grandson and an old alumnus of Jiaotong University, Shen Yude.

This Liu Garden is a modern building with a strong Chinese national architectural style. The total construction area is over 2,000 square meters, with a six-story frame structure, white walls, red pillars, and a Japanese-style double-eaved roof.

The original Liu Garden in Tokyo was established by Mr. Shen Yude in 1961.
