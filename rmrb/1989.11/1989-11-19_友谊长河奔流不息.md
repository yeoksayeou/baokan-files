The River of Friendship Flows On
By Shǐ Zōngxīng, Xinhua News Agency

At 9 AM on the 18th, Premier Li Peng, accompanied by President Ershad, drove through a welcoming crowd of over 100,000 people to visit the "China-Bangladesh Friendship Bridge" in the southeastern suburbs of Dhaka.

This bridge is 847.36 meters long and 17.6 meters wide, supported by 21 piers, and spans the Buriganga River. It is the largest road bridge in Bangladesh to date. Due to the joint efforts of engineering and technical personnel from both China and Bangladesh, the bridge began full-scale construction in November 1986 and was officially opened to traffic in March this year, 14 months ahead of schedule. After learning about these details, Premier Li said, "This bridge is a symbol of friendly cooperation between China and Bangladesh, jointly invested in and constructed by engineers from both countries." Bangladesh's Minister of Communications, Hussein, told Premier Li, "As long as this bridge stands, the people of Bangladesh will never forget the friendly sentiments of the Chinese people."

Later, Premier Li boarded the presidential yacht at a nearby engineering wharf. The golden sunlight bathed the rippling river, and a gentle breeze swept across the deck. Premier Li and President Ershad sat side by side on the forward deck. The yacht moved slowly, parting the waves. Both banks were filled with fields and people and livestock bustling about. Among the swaying palm trees, villages were hidden. Tens of thousands of villagers lined the riverbanks, waving the national flags of China and Bangladesh, playing instruments, and shouting slogans in welcome to Premier Li and his entourage. Premier Li and President Ershad walked to the bow of the ship, stood by the railing, and waved back to the crowds on both banks.

At 10 AM, the two leaders entered a spacious conference room on the ship and sat opposite each other at the center of the long table to begin their formal talks. They discussed international and regional situations and explored new areas and ways to expand cooperation between the two countries. At the end of the talks, the ministers from both sides signed five documents related to the development of cooperation between the two countries.

Premier Li and his entourage spent a pleasant four and a half hours on the beautiful Buriganga River, achieving fruitful results from this visit. When he left the ship and returned to the state guesthouse, he was once again greeted by tens of thousands of people lining the streets.

Since arriving in Dhaka yesterday afternoon, Premier Li and his entourage have been immersed in a sea of friendship. Last night, the entire city of Dhaka was brightly lit, with colorful lanterns hanging along the main streets and at major intersections. At the grand welcome banquet hosted by President Ershad, the atmosphere was one of family reunion from beginning to end. This morning, more than a thousand representatives from various sectors of Dhaka gathered on the north lawn of the Parliament Building to hold a citizens' reception for Premier Li. Citizens sat around tables, sipping tea and chatting about friendship. Tonight at 7:30 PM, President Ershad and his wife will host a small family dinner for Premier Li and his wife at their home. All of this is of the highest standard and sincerely heartfelt.

Tomorrow morning, Premier Li will bid farewell to Dhaka and board a flight to Nepal. Although his visit to Bangladesh lasted only 45 hours, the impressions he gained are beautiful, and the results are fruitful.

As a Bangladeshi government news official said to our reporter today at the "China-Bangladesh Friendship Bridge": "Premier Li Peng's visit has made the ever-flowing river of friendship between the peoples of Bangladesh and China flow even more smoothly."

    友谊长河奔流不息
    本报记者　史宗星
    18日上午9时，李鹏总理由艾尔沙德总统陪同，沿着十多万群众的欢迎夹道，驱车到达卡东南郊的“孟中友谊桥”参观。
    这座大桥长847.36米，宽17.6米，由21座桥墩高高托起，横卧在布里甘加河上，是孟加拉国迄今最大的公路桥。由于中孟两国工程技术人员齐心协力，该桥1986年11月全面动工，今年3月正式通车，比预定计划提前14个月完工。李总理了解到这些情况以后高兴地说：“这座大桥由中孟两国共同投资，两国工程人员共同施工，是两国友好合作的一个象征。”孟加拉国交通部长侯赛因对李总理说：“只要这座大桥存在一天，孟加拉国人民就不会忘记中国人民的友好情意。”
    随后，李总理在附近的工兵码头登上了总统游艇。金灿灿的阳光洒满碧波粼粼的河面，阵阵爽风拂过甲板。李总理和艾尔沙德总统在前甲板并排而坐。游艇缓缓行驶，犁开层层碧波。两岸田连阡陌，人畜繁忙，在那迎风摇曳的椰林之中，掩映出一个个村庄。成千上万村民沿两岸河堤一字排开，挥舞着中孟两国国旗，击打着乐器，高呼着口号，向游艇上的李总理一行致意。李总理和艾尔沙德总统走到船头，扶栏站立，频频向两岸群众挥手致谢。
    时钟指向10点，两位领导人走进船上的一间宽敞的会议室，在长条桌两侧中央相对而坐，开始正式会谈。他们讨论了国际和地区形势，探讨了进一步扩大两国合作的新领域和新途径。会谈结束时，双方部长们签署了5个有关发展两国合作的文件。
    李总理一行在美丽的布里甘加河上度过了愉快的4个多小时，取得了他这次访问的丰硕成果。当他离船返回国宾馆时，再一次受到十几万群众的夹道欢迎。
    自从昨天下午抵达卡以来，李总理一行无时无处不沉浸在友谊的海洋里。昨晚，整个达卡城灯火辉煌，主要街道沿途和主要街口，都挂起了五彩缤纷的彩灯。在艾尔沙德总统举行的盛大欢迎宴会上，自始至终洋溢着家人相聚的气氛。今天上午，来自达卡各界的千余名市民代表汇集在议会大厦的北草坪上，为李总理举行了市民招待会。市民们围着一张张方几就座，边喝茶边叙友情。今晚7时半，艾尔沙德总统和夫人又把李总理夫妇接到自己家中，设小型家宴款待中国客人。所有这一切，都是高规格的，又是出自内心的真诚。
    明天上午李总理将告别达卡，登上飞往尼泊尔的航程。对孟加拉国的访问虽然只有短暂的45小时，但得到的印象却是美好的，成果也是丰硕的。
    正如一位孟加拉国政府新闻官员今天在“孟中友谊桥”上对本报记者所说：“李鹏总理的这次访问，使奔流不息的孟中两国人民友谊长河流得更加欢畅了。”
