Rakowski Calls for Strengthening Unity and Opposing Splits at the Polish United Workers' Party Plenum

	Xinhua News Agency Warsaw, November 8

	Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee First Secretary Rakowski recently called on the entire party to strengthen unity and oppose splits, and to "continuously engage in daily, arduous work" to win the hearts of the people.

	Rakowski made this call in his closing speech at the 6th plenary session of the 16th Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party. The full text of his speech was published in the November 7 issue of the Polish newspaper "People's Tribune."

	In his speech, he pointed out that the Polish United Workers' Party is currently facing "unprecedented difficulties and complex situations in more than 40 years." The party not only needs to counter the attacks from the right, but also to prevent internal splits. He believes that in this situation, members of the Polish United Workers' Party should unite and strive for the socialist cause.

	Regarding the 11th National Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, which is scheduled to be held on January 27 next year, Rakowski emphasized that the success of the 11th Congress will be a severe test for the leaders and all members of the Polish party. He expressed his belief that the members of the Polish United Workers' Party will not be those who seek to abolish, but rather those who "creatively inherit the socialist and communist ideas of Poland and Europe."

	In his speech, Rakowski criticized the government led by Solidarity, stating that the current government's actions indicate that it is attempting to abolish public ownership under the guise of "changing ownership relations." He pointed out that changing ownership is a major issue with institutional and public significance, and on this issue, the party and the entire Polish society must express their stance.

    拉科夫斯基在波统一工人党全会上号召
    全党加强团结反对分裂
    新华社华沙11月8日电　波兰统一工人党中央第一书记拉科夫斯基最近号召全党加强团结，反对分裂，为争取民心而“不断地做日常的、艰苦的工作”。
    拉科夫斯基是在6日举行的波兰统一工人党16中全会上致闭幕词时向全党发出上述号召的。波《人民论坛报》7日刊登了他的讲话全文。
    他在讲话中指出，波兰统一工人党今天面临着40多年来“从未经历过的困难和复杂的形势”。党不仅要反击右派的进攻，而且还要防止内部的分裂。他认为，统一工人党党员在这一形势下应团结起来，为社会主义事业而奋斗。
    在谈到将于明年1月27日召开的波兰统一工人党第11次代表大会时，拉科夫斯基强调说，党的11大是否开得成功将是对波党领导人和全体党员的一次严峻考验。他表示相信，统一工人党党员们将不是取消派，而是“创造性继承波兰和欧洲社会主义和共产主义思想”的人。
    拉科夫斯基在讲话中对团结工会领导的政府提出了批评，说现政府的言行表明，它企图在“变革所有制关系”的幌子下取消全民所有制。他指出，改变所有制是具有制度性和全民性的重大问题，在这个问题上党和整个波兰社会都必须表明自己的态度。
