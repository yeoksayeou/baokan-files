On the morning of August 10th, at 8 AM, Zhang, a resident of Caiyuan Village, Lvzhuang Village Committee in our township, sneaked into the orchard of the contract holder Zhao Fuquan and stole a sack of apples (about 30 kilograms) and was caught. Instead of admitting his mistake, Zhang beat and scolded the contract holder. Ten minutes later, Zhang's relative Cui, leading a group of people armed with weapons, rushed into the courtyard and beat five farmers, causing them to bleed from their mouths and noses. Then, Zhang and Cui incited many villagers from Lvzhuang and Dingtang to rush in and loot the 200 mu of ripe apples and pears, totaling over 70,000 kilograms, and trampled over more than 100 mu of crops.

At 3 PM, Zhang and Cui, using Dingtang villagers Cui and Sun, led 30 more people to smash the doors of the warehouse and dormitory in the orchard, taking away all the apples and pears that had been picked, and destroying and looting property worth over 4,000 yuan. Farmer Lü Wenhua's 1,500-plus kilograms of apples were also looted by over 40 villagers from Dingtang at noon on the same day.

After the incident, we immediately reported to the village committee and the police station, and informed the relevant leaders of the county. What is even more heartbreaking is that the village cadres unilaterally terminated our contract the day after the orchard was looted. To cultivate the orchard, we have invested nearly 30,000 yuan in loans over the years. How are we supposed to live now?

    果园被哄抢  果农诉遭遇
    8月10日上午8时，我乡吕庄村委菜园村村民张某，潜入承包户赵付仓的果园偷盗苹果一袋（约30公斤）被抓住。张不但不承认错误，反而打骂承包人。事过10分钟，张的亲属崔某领着人，手持凶器，冲到场院内，将5名果农打得口鼻出血。接着，张、崔又分别鼓动吕庄村和丁堂村的许多名群众，一哄而上，把200亩已成熟的7万余公斤苹果、梨哄抢一空，并踏坏庄稼100多亩。
    下午3时，张、崔利用丁堂村村民崔某某、孙某又带领30余人砸毁了果园内仓库门和宿舍门，将摘下的部分苹果、梨全部抢走，还把屋内价值4000余元的财物毁坏抢走。果农吕文华的1500余公斤苹果，当天中午12时，也被丁堂村的40余名村民抢走了。
    事情发生后，我们当即向村委、派出所报案，找到县有关部门的领导汇报了案情。更令人痛心的是，我村的干部在哄抢果园的第二天，单方中止了我们的合同。为了种果园，几年来，我们贷款投资近3万元。如此这般，我们以后怎样生活下去？
