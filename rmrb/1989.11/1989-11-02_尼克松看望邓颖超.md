    尼克松看望邓颖超
    本报北京11月1日讯　记者丁刚报道：今天下午，美国前总统尼克松前往中南海，看望邓颖超同志。邓颖超高兴地对尼克松说：“为了欢迎您，我身边的工作人员在客厅里布置了蝴蝶形的鲜花。”尼克松先生回答说：“非常荣幸，非常高兴”。
    尼克松转达了他夫人的问候，邓颖超也托尼克松向他夫人转达她的问候。宾主畅叙友情，回顾了中美两国关系的发展和友好交往。
    邓颖超对尼克松在1972年打开中美关系时显示出的远见和勇气表示钦佩。尼克松对已故的周恩来总理表示深切的怀念。他称赞周恩来总理是一位伟大的政治家、外交家。
    在谈到中美关系目前出现的困难时，邓颖超说，责任不在中方，是美国干涉了中国的内政，而和平共处五项原则中最重要的就是互不干涉内政。邓颖超说，中国有一句古话：“解铃还需系铃人”。美国应该采取主动，希望尼克松先生作为老朋友继续为中美友好作出努力。
