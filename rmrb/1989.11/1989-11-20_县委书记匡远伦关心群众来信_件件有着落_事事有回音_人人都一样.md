    County Committee Secretary Kuang Yuanlun Cares About Letters from the Masses
    Every Letter Has a Follow-Up, Every Issue Has a Response, Everyone Is Treated Equally

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, November 19th - (Correspondent Peng Shengbiao) A county committee secretary overseeing 2793 square kilometers of land and a population of 350,000 people undoubtedly has a lot of work and is very busy. However, amidst the tight schedule and busy work, he never forgets to do this one thing every day: open and read letters from the masses, and record the names, units, dates, contents, and comments of each letter in his specially made "letter and visit logbook." He is Kuang Yuanlun, the county committee secretary of Anfu County, Jiangxi Province.

    Kuang Yuanlun originally worked in Jinggangshan City and was transferred to Anfu in September 1987. Over the past two years, with a strong sense of responsibility, Kuang Yuanlun has personally followed up on every letter from the masses.

    Last year, a farmer from Longshang Village in Hukeng Town of this county wrote to Kuang Yuanlun, reporting that some officials in the town were abusing their power for personal gain and illegally logging timber. He instructed the county discipline inspection commission and other departments to immediately form a working group to investigate. Later, he repeatedly followed up on the progress and results of the investigation. Several months later, the relevant departments finally uncovered a serious case of several key officials in the town embezzling public funds and some village officials illegally logging timber. According to the relevant regulations, they were promptly dealt with.

    Kuang Yuanlun has very strict and serious requirements for letter and visit work. In addition to regularly following up, he personally goes to the letter and visit office at the end of each month, quarter, or year, holding his letter and visit logbook, checking and inquiring about the handling results of the letters, the situation of replies, which ones have not been investigated, which ones are being investigated, which ones have been replied to, which ones have not been replied to, and what difficulties there are, etc. For every letter and visit item he has transferred and assigned, there is no negligence or omission. He has ensured that every letter has a follow-up, every issue has a response, and everyone is treated equally.

    Since Kuang Yuanlun became the county committee secretary of Anfu County, he has personally registered and assigned 1057 letter and visit items, most of which have been investigated, handled, and replied to, and some are still being investigated. The work is busy, but his heart is closer to the people. The number of letters received has also increased year by year, from 176 in 1987 to 441 in 1988, and by mid-November this year, 440 letters from the masses have been received.

    Kuang Yuanlun's letter and visit logbook connects the hearts of 350,000 people in the entire county.

    县委书记匡远伦关心群众来信
    件件有着落  事事有回音  人人都一样
    新华社南昌11月19日电　（通讯员彭声骠）一个管辖2793平方公里土地、35万人口的县委书记，事情之多、工作之忙是不言而喻的。然而，紧张与繁忙中，他每天总忘不了做这件事：拆阅信访件，并逐件将来信人姓名、单位、来信时间、内容及批转意见一一登记在自己特制的“信访本”上。他，便是江西省安福县委书记匡远伦。
    匡远伦原在井冈山市工作，1987年9月调任安福。两年多来，凭着一颗责任心，匡远伦对每一封群众来信都一一过问。
    去年，这个县浒坑镇龙上村一位农民写信给匡远伦，反映本镇村的一些干部以权谋私，乱砍滥伐木材的问题。他责成县纪委等部门立即组成工作组进行调查，此后，又多次过问了解调查进展与结果。几个月后，有关部门终于查清这个镇确实有几个主要干部集体私分公款、一些村干部乱砍滥伐林木的严重违纪事件，随即依据有关规定进行了处理。
    匡远伦对信访工作的要求十分严格和认真。除平常经常过问外，每到月末、季末或年末，他都要拿着信访本，亲自找到信访办公室，对照、查询信访件的处理结果，函复情况，哪些没查、哪些正在查、哪些已函复，哪些还没函复，有什么困难等等。凡经他批转交办的信访件，无一马虎从事，无一遗漏。做到了件件有着落，事事有回音，人人都一样。
    匡远伦任安福县委书记以来，亲自登记、交办的信访件计1057件，大部分已调查、处理、函复，有些正在查处中。工作是忙些，但他和群众的心贴得更近了。收到的信访件也逐年增加，从1987年的176件增加到1988年的441件，今年到11月中旬，就收到群众来信440件。
    匡远伦的信访本连结着全县35万人民的心。
