South-North cooperation to address severe population and ecological challenges
By Wei Wei, People's Daily Reporter

In early November, two international conferences addressing issues of global concern were held almost simultaneously in the Netherlands: one was the "21st Century Population Forum," and the other was the "Ministerial Conference on Atmospheric Pollution and Climate Change." Both conferences reflect a historical necessity: today, all countries, regardless of their wealth, size, or location, must take joint action to strive for a virtuous cycle of population and ecology.

The world's total population surpassed 5.2 billion at the beginning of this year and continues to grow at an annual rate of 1.7%. According to United Nations statistics, by the end of this century, the world's total population will reach 6 billion. If uncontrolled or if controls fail, by around 2030, the world's population will exceed 10 billion! The "population explosion" has already led to a sharp decrease in arable land, destruction of forests, over-exploitation of resources, and increasingly severe environmental pollution. Moreover, from a global perspective, population growth is extremely uneven across regions. The population in the Third World is growing too fast, while in industrialized countries like North America, Western Europe, and Japan, the population growth rate is too low, leading to an aging population and hindering sustained economic development.

Closely related to the population issue is the environmental problem. This international conference on atmospheric pollution and climate change primarily discussed how to protect the global climate. Documents distributed at the conference stated that human activities have altered the composition of the Earth's atmosphere. Excessive carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), nitrous oxide, methane, and other gases are causing the "greenhouse effect," threatening the future of the Earth.

It is estimated that if the global temperature rises by 2.5 degrees Celsius, global GDP will decrease by 3%, with developing countries being the first and most severely affected. The document also predicts that if timely action is not taken, "the next century will see serious disruptions in economic and social order."

While developing countries need to make arduous efforts to control population growth, developed countries bear the primary responsibility for the threats posed by human-induced climate change.

Since the mid-19th century, developed countries have consumed far more mineral energy than developing countries. For example, the main culprit of the greenhouse effect—carbon dioxide—is currently emitted at an annual rate of 4 tons per person in industrialized countries, while in developing countries, the annual per capita emission of carbon dioxide is less than 0.3 tons.

In summary, facing the two major challenges of population and environment, both developing and developed countries need to adopt a serious and responsible attitude. They must strengthen their domestic efforts and actively participate in global cooperation to address potential common disasters.

Humanity is about to enter the last decade of the 20th century. For the future of the Earth and the future of humanity, cooperation between developing and developed countries needs a breakthrough in both content and form. Currently, such a breakthrough is possible because an increasing number of countries and international and non-governmental organizations worldwide recognize the urgency and necessity of strengthening South-North cooperation.

The two international conferences mentioned above were unprecedented in scale and issued similar calls for global cooperation, fully demonstrating this point.

　　南北合作对付人口与生态严峻挑战
　　本报记者　魏崴
    十一月上旬，两个事关当前世界各国普遍关心问题的国际会议几乎同时在荷兰召开：一个是“二十一世纪人口论坛”，一个是“大气污染和气候变化部长级会议”。两个会议反映出一个历史要求：当今世界各国，不分穷富大小，无论东西南北，必须共同行动，为人口与生态进入良性循环而不懈努力。
    世界总人口今年初已突破了五十二亿大关，而且正以百分之一点七的年增长率继续增长。据联合国的统计，到本世纪末，世界总人口将达六十亿。倘若不加控制或控制失效，到了二○三○年左右，世界人口将要突破一百亿！“人口爆炸”，已经导致了耕地面积锐减、森林遭到破坏、资源的过度开发及环境日益严重的污染。另外，从全球角度看来，人口的发展在各地区又极不平衡。第三世界人口增长过快，而北美、西欧、日本等工业发达国家，人口增长率又嫌太低，它已导致人口老龄化日趋严重，阻碍经济持续发展。
    与人口问题休戚相关的是环境问题。此次国际大气污染和气候变化部长会议，主要是讨论如何保护全球性气候。会议散发的文件认为，由于人类的活动，地球的大气组成发生变化。过量的二氧化碳及氟里昴
  （CFC）、氧化氮、甲烷等造成“温室效应”，正威胁着地球的前途。
    据估计，如全球温度增加二点五摄氏度，那么全球产值将降低百分之三，而发展中国家将首当其冲，深受其害。该文件还预计，如不及时采取行动，“下一个世纪将出现经济与社会秩序的严重紊乱”。
    如果说，在控制人口膨胀上，发展中国家需作出艰苦努力的话，那么在人为气候变化给世界造成的威胁方面，发达国家负有主要责任。
    自十九世纪中叶至今，发达国家矿物能源消耗大大超过发展中国家。例如，造成温室效应的罪魁——二氧化碳，现在工业发达国的年排放量，人均为四吨，而发展中国家中二氧化碳年人均排放量，尚不到零点三吨。
    总之，面对着人口与环境两大挑战，无论是发展中国家还是发达国家，都需以严肃认真的态度，在国内不断加强自身的努力，在国际上积极参与世界性合作，以应付可能出现的共同灾难。
    人类即将步入二十世纪的最后十年。为了地球的未来，为了人类的明天，发展中国家和发达国家之间的合作，在内容和形式上皆需要有一个突破。现在看来，这种突破也是可能的，因为在世界范围内，越来越多的国家，越来越多的国际间组织及非政府性机构，意识到加强南北合作的紧迫性、必要性。
    上述两个国际性会议盛况空前，而且在全球合作上发出了类似的呼吁，便充分证明了这一点。
