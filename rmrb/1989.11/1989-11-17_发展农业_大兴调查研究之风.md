Strengthening the foundational role of agriculture and promoting its new development has become one of the urgent issues that the entire nation is focused on. The decision of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party is to quickly create a nationwide atmosphere of valuing, supporting, and developing agriculture, uniting efforts to improve agriculture, and ensuring the stable growth of major agricultural products such as grain and cotton. This is completely correct.

How can we promote the new development of agriculture? I believe that the most authoritative voice should come from practice, from those grassroots units that have already or are currently in the process of overcoming difficulties and achieving new developments. This not only includes village-level and township-level grassroots units but also a considerable number of counties and even regions. In these places, township enterprises are making rapid progress, grain production is continuously developing, farmers' incomes are steadily increasing, and the rural economy is flourishing. Anhui Province's Chuzhou Region is a prominent example. This region was long plagued by poverty and backwardness, but during the rural reforms, it started early and underwent significant changes. More importantly, after the national grain production stagnated in 1985, the rural economy of Chuzhou Region maintained a continuous, stable, and coordinated development trend within the entire region. First, grain production continued to increase, with an annual increase of about 200 million jin (approximately 100,000 metric tons), providing more commercial grain each year than the total grain production before the reforms by 600-800 million jin (approximately 300,000-400,000 metric tons), totaling over 20 billion jin (approximately 10 million metric tons) in ten years. Oil crops and other economic crops also increased severalfold. The total agricultural output value increased by 10% annually for ten consecutive years. Meanwhile, the total output value of township enterprises increased from 70 million yuan in 1978 to 2.8 billion yuan in 1988, a growth of over 30 times. The construction of rural spiritual civilization also has many new achievements.

Since the rural reforms, Xinjiang's agricultural production has been continuously developing without any fluctuations, a unique situation among all provinces and regions in the country. Xinjiang's conditions are vastly different from the inland areas, and it has its own unique characteristics. Surprisingly, during our discussions and on-site inspections, we deeply felt that these two places have some valuable experiences in common. To explore and understand the objective laws of China's agricultural development, we must seriously study these experiences.

Of course, it is not possible to summarize the systematic experiences of Xinjiang or Chuzhou here, but only to briefly discuss a few of the most profound impressions:

First, starting from reality, continuously strengthening the foundational role of agriculture, especially grain production. This is something almost everyone says, but the key is how to act during critical moments. In 1984, after several years of bumper harvests, there was a localized structural "difficulty in selling grain." At that time, there was a lack of calm analysis, and under the influence of blind optimism, there was a nationwide trend to reduce the area of grain fields. The Chuzhou Region did not follow this trend, emphasizing starting from local realities and making only appropriate adjustments, thus ensuring the continuous increase in grain production; and through the practice of continuous increase, a deeper understanding was gained that without a stable area of grain fields, there would be no stable grain production. This trend also reached the areas outside the Jade Gate Pass. The main responsible person of the regional party committee, Wang Enmao, firmly advocated holding onto agriculture tightly, leading Xinjiang's rural economy onto a path of continuous, stable, and coordinated development. From 1978 to 1988, the total grain production increased from 6.455 billion jin (approximately 3.2275 million metric tons) to 12.123 billion jin (approximately 6.0615 million metric tons), with an annual increase of 5.9%; the main agricultural and pastoral products all increased severalfold; the total agricultural output value increased by 9.98% annually. Starting from 1983, grain imports turned into exports.

Second, focusing on stabilizing and improving the household contract responsibility system to deepen reforms. Implementing the household contract responsibility system is the main achievement of the first step of rural reforms. However, after 1985, there were different opinions on how to deepen rural reforms. Many places were engaged in endless debates, busy formulating reform plans, but did not seriously investigate, study, and solve the new situations and problems that arose after implementing the contract responsibility system. Some even thought that the potential of the contract responsibility system had been fully utilized and had become an obstacle to agricultural development. The Chuzhou Region took more action than talk. They consistently focused on stabilizing and improving the household contract responsibility system. On one hand, they firmly stabilized family farming and fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the farmers; on the other hand, they paid great attention to strengthening the functions of village and township-level organizations, establishing and improving various forms of service systems, and gradually matching them to connect farmers with the market. Over the past ten years, agricultural infrastructure construction has never stopped, and the area of irrigated land has been continuously expanding. This year, 130,000 mu (approximately 8,667 hectares) of dry land has been converted into paddy fields, which is an important factor in continuous increase in production. Xinjiang is also prominent in this aspect. Oasis agriculture relies entirely on snowmelt irrigation, and unified measures are necessary. Therefore, the implementation of the contract responsibility system generally takes the form of "unified management and large-scale contracting," combining unified services with household management from the beginning. Xinjiang's rural economic development level is lower than the inland areas, with underdeveloped diversified operations and township enterprises that have only recently started, leaving surplus labor with nothing to do. Aiming at this characteristic, Xinjiang vigorously advocated labor accumulation, carried out large-scale agricultural water conservancy construction, and launched the "Five Good" construction campaign of fields, canals, forests, roads, and villages, with 40 counties and 41 military farm units having already achieved agricultural forest networkization, greatly reducing the harm of wind and sand, ensuring and promoting stable and increased production. The contract responsibility system has also been continuously improved.

Third, seeking production and benefits through science and technology. Agricultural development relies on policies, science and technology, and investment. The role of science and technology in agriculture has become increasingly prominent in recent years and has attracted widespread attention. The Chuzhou Region started this work relatively early and maintained continuity. They skillfully applied the principle of combining rights, responsibilities, and benefits of the contract responsibility system to various aspects, encouraging technical personnel to go to the countryside early on, exploring paid contracting methods, ensuring reasonable remuneration, actively promoting the construction of grassroots technical teams, and promoting the popularization of applicable technologies. Currently, 90% of the grain fields in the entire region use self-bred hybrid varieties, and 70-80% adopt the two-stage seedling raising method, with significant increase in production. Xinjiang also attaches great importance to the promotion of advanced scientific technologies. Over the past eleven years, the main crop varieties have been replaced or updated 2-3 times, basically achieving varietal improvement. In recent years, the development of plastic film cultivation technology has been rapid, with 3.37 million mu (approximately 224,667 hectares) of plastic film cotton in 1988, accounting for 63% of the total cotton area. They also pay attention to guiding farmers to use their own funds to purchase agricultural machinery. In 1988, the number of agricultural tractors increased by 2.96 times compared to 1977, and the number of agricultural vehicles increased by 4.2 times.

Fourth, cherishing grassroots cadres and emphasizing grassroots construction. In recent years, the leadership of the party in rural areas has weakened, and ideological and political work has been diluted, with many tasks left unattended. Although there are problems such as coercion and power-seeking in the grassroots organizations of the Chuzhou Region, they have not collapsed. The main reason is that the party committees at the prefecture and county levels cherish grassroots cadres and emphasize grassroots construction. In the early days of the reform, many grassroots cadres had difficulties understanding, but they were not easily punished, focusing instead on education, and the transfer of cadres was extremely cautious, basically completing this profound rural social transformation. To match the contract responsibility system, they proposed implementing the contract system, cadre position responsibility system, and cadre term target responsibility system as early as 1980. They have consistently paid great attention to the ideological and organizational construction of grassroots organizations. Some practices seem to be old-fashioned, but in fact, they are exploring how to leverage the party's fine traditions under the conditions of developing a commodity economy, and even if they are not very mature, they are worth further analysis and research. The experience of the leaders of Fukang County in Xinjiang in conducting in-depth investigations and research in grassroots areas and strengthening grassroots construction is also very valuable. They have become the most advanced county in the rapid development of Xinjiang's rural economy.

Currently, the external environment for the development of agriculture in Chuzhou and Xinjiang is very severe, and they have encountered many difficulties that affect agricultural development, which they cannot solve on their own. If the macro-level problems are solved well, they will definitely be able to continue to develop. Therefore, on one hand, we should pay attention to their experiences, and on the other hand, we should help them solve the problems they cannot solve on their own. Developing agriculture requires a strong spirit of investigation and research. Practice produces knowledge, practice produces talent, and practice is the criterion for testing truth. We must adhere to this basic viewpoint of Marxism.

    发展农业　大兴调查研究之风
    吴象
    切实加强农业的基础地位，尽快促进农业的新发展，已成为全国普遍关注的紧迫问题之一。党的十三届五中全会决定，迅速在全党全国造成一个重视农业、支援农业和发展农业的热潮，齐心合力把农业搞上去，确保粮食、棉花等主要农产品的稳定增长。这是完全正确的。
    怎样才能促进农业的新发展呢？我认为，最有发言权的应当是实践，是那些已经或正在实践中走出困境、取得新发展的基层单位。这不仅指村一级、乡一级基层，还有相当一批县以至地区。那里乡镇企业突飞猛进，粮食生产持续发展，农民收入稳定增长，农村经济全面繁荣。安徽省滁县地区就是个突出的代表。这个地区过去长期贫困落后，农村改革中起步早、变化大，更可贵的是，1985年全国粮食生产转向徘徊后，滁县地区农村经济却在全区范围内一直保持着持续、稳定、协调发展的势头。首先是粮食仍在节节上升，每年递增2亿斤左右，每年提供的商品粮比改革前粮食总产量还要多6—8亿斤，十年总计超过200亿斤。油料等经济作物也成倍增长。农业总产值连续十年以10％的幅度增长。与此同时，乡镇企业总产值由1978年的7000多万元上升为1988年的28亿元，增长30多倍。农村精神文明建设也有不少新的创造。
    新疆自农村改革以来农业生产持续发展，没有发生过波动，在全国各省区中是独一份。新疆各方面同内地差别太大，更有其特殊性。出乎意料的是，我们在座谈讨论、实地考察中，深感这两个地方有某些具有共同性的宝贵经验。要探索、认识中国农业发展的客观规律，必须认真研究这些经验。
    这里当然不可能总结新疆或滁县的系统经验，只能简要地谈几点印象最深的感受：
    第一，从实际出发，不断加强农业尤其是粮食生产的基础地位。这话口头上几乎人人在说，问题在于关键时刻怎么干。1984年，在农业连年大丰收后，出现了局部性结构性的“卖粮难”。当时对此缺乏冷静分析，在盲目乐观情绪影响下，全国一度压缩粮田面积成风。滁县地区没有跟风跑，强调从本地实际出发，只作适当比例的调整，从而保证了以后粮食的持续增产；又通过持续增产的实践，更深刻地认识到没有稳定的粮田面积，就没有稳定的粮食产量。当年这股风也刮到了玉门关外。区党委主要负责人王恩茂坚决主张紧紧抓住农业不放，使新疆农村经济走上了持续、稳定、协调发展的道路。从1978年到1988年粮食总产由64.55亿斤增到121.23亿斤，年增5.9％；主要农牧产品都成倍增长；农业总产值年递增9.98％。从1983年开始，粮食调入已变为调出。
    第二，紧紧围绕稳定、完善家庭联产承包制深化改革。实行家庭联产承包制是农村第一步改革的主要成果。但1985年后，农村改革如何深化，一直有不同看法。不少地方争论不休，忙于制订改革方案，对实行承包制后出现的新情况、新问题，却没有认真去调查、研究、解决。有的甚至认为联产承包制潜力已经用完，变为发展农业的障碍。滁县地区行动多于议论。始终在稳定、完善家庭联产承包制上大做文章。他们一方面坚定不移地稳定家庭经营，充分发挥农民的积极性；另一方面十分重视加强村、乡两级组织的职能，建立健全多种形式的服务体系，并使之逐步配套，把农民与市场联接起来。十年来，农田基本建设从未间断，灌溉面积日益扩大，今年又有13万亩旱地改为水田。这是持续增产的重要因素。新疆这方面也很突出。绿洲农业全靠雪水灌溉，非有必要的统一措施不可。因此实行联产承包制一般采取“几统一的大包干”的形式，把统一服务和分户经营一开始就结合起来了。新疆农村经济发展水平比内地低，多种经营不够发达，乡镇企业近几年刚刚起步，剩余劳力无事可干。针对这一特点，新疆大力提倡劳动积累，大搞农田水利建设，开展田、渠、林、路、村相配套的“五好建设”运动，迄今已有40个县和41个兵团农场实现农田林网化，大大减少了风沙危害，保证和促进了稳产增产。联产承包制也由此不断地得到完善。
      第三，向科学技术要产量要效益。农业发展，一靠政策二靠科技三靠投入。科技兴农的作用近几年来日益突出，已引起普遍的重视。滁县地区这方面工作抓得比较早，而且保持了连续性。他们善于把承包制权、责、利相结合的原则运用到各个方面，早几年就鼓励科技人员下乡，探索有偿承包的办法，使之得到合理报酬，积极带动基层科技队伍的建设，促进了适用科技的普及。目前全区粮田已有90％使用自己培育的杂交良种，70—80％采用两段育秧法，增产效果极为明显。新疆对推广先进科学技术同样十分重视。十一年来主要作物品种更换或更新2—3次，基本实现良种化。近几年地膜栽培技术发展很快，1988年地膜棉达337万亩，占棉田总面积63％。他们还重视引导农民用自有资金购买农业机械。1988年农用拖拉机比1977年增长2.96倍，农用汽车增长4.2倍。
    第四，爱护基层干部，重视基层建设。近几年农村党的领导削弱，思想政治工作淡化，许多工作没人抓、没人管。滁县地区的基层组织中虽然也存在强迫命令、以权谋私等等问题，但基本上没有瘫痪的。其中主要原因是，地、县党委爱护基层干部，重视基层建设。改革初期，不少基层干部思想不通，他们不轻易处罚人，着重于教育，调换干部也极慎重，基本上完成了这一场深刻的农村社会大变革。为了同联产承包制配套，他们早在1980年就提出实行合同制、干部岗位责任制，以及干部任期目标责任制。对基层组织的思想建设、组织建设一直抓得比较紧。有些做法看来似乎是老一套，实际上是在发展商品经济的条件下探索如何发挥党的优良传统，即使很不成熟也值得进一步分析研究。新疆阜康县领导同志深入基层调查研究，加强基层建设的经验，也很可贵。他们成为新疆农村经济发展最快的先进县。
      目前滁县、新疆农业发展的外部环境都很严峻，遇到了不少影响农业发展的困难，这是他们无力自行解决的。如果宏观方面的问题解决得好，肯定能持续发展。因此一方面应重视他们的经验，另一方面要帮助他们解决自身解决不了的问题。发展农业必须大兴调查研究之风。实践出真知，实践出人才，实践是检验真理的标准。我们必须坚持马克思主义这个基本观点。
