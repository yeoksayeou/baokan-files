A police vehicle carrying approximately 40 officers was recently attacked by a high-powered bomb in Medellín, the second-largest city in Colombia. The attack resulted in 5 deaths, 16 injuries, and the destruction of the police vehicle.

According to reports, this is the most severe bombing incident to occur in Medellín since the Barco government launched its anti-drug campaign two months ago.

Colombian authorities stated that while the exact cause of the bomb attack is unclear, they suspect it was carried out by a drug trafficking organization. Medellín is the headquarters of Colombia's largest cocaine trafficking group.
