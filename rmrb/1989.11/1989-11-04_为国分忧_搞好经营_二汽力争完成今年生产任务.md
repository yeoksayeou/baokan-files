The workers of the Second Automobile Works, with a spirit of sharing the nation's worries and difficulties, have formulated strategies and intensified production and operational activities to strive for the completion of this year's various tasks.

The Second Automobile Works (Second Auto Works) faces numerous difficulties in production and operations due to a shortage of working capital. Starting in September, the sales of the previously popular Dongfeng trucks began to slow down. In October, 9,985 vehicles were sold, which is 83% of the average monthly sales in previous months. The profits realized from January to September decreased by 17% compared to the same period last year, making the situation severe.

Despite the challenges, the large enterprise remains calm. After studying Jiang Zemin's National Day speech, the entire workforce recognized the severity of the current situation and the necessity and importance of rectification and austerity. They overcame negative and passive attitudes and decided to launch a final push in the fourth quarter to achieve the goal of producing 135,000 vehicles this year.

On October 30, the Second Auto Works held an expanded meeting to formulate a series of measures. The central focus is to strengthen planning and financial management and launch the "Double Increase, Double Decrease" campaign. They aim to tighten various expenditures and reduce costs. They will further streamline and reduce construction projects, concentrating efforts on the state's key project, the EQ153 type 8-ton flat-head diesel truck.

The supply department reported that material supply has recently eased, and some steel prices have fallen, indicating that the rectification and austerity measures are beginning to show results. The Second Auto Works leadership demands full utilization of these favorable conditions, flexible operations, and a reduction of next year's material inventory by 46 days to decrease the occupation of working capital. In the face of a tightening market, the Second Auto Works will expand its market share through better after-sales technical services and quality service. The sales department has dispatched more than 20 experienced cadres to various regions to guide and strengthen sales work.

In recent years, the Second Auto Works has introduced new car models annually. The leadership pointed out that technological development is the key to winning in fierce competition. They urged the Technology Development Center to mobilize urgently and spare no effort to accelerate the production preparation of the second-generation new products, EQ153 and EQ140-2, striving to launch them on schedule. They also immediately began the development and research of the third-generation product, EQ140-3.

### 为国分忧　搞好经营  二汽力争完成今年生产任务

    为国分忧　搞好经营
    二汽力争完成今年生产任务
    本报讯　记者林钢报道：第二汽车制造厂职工怀着为国分忧解难的豪情，制定对策，抓紧生产经营活动，力争完成今年各项任务。
    二汽因流动资金紧缺，今年生产经营中困难因素甚多。进入9月份，一直畅销不衰的东风卡车销售也开始疲软。10月份销售9985辆，是前几个月平均数的83％。1—9月实现的利润较去年同期减少17％，形势严峻。
    毕竟是大企业，临危不乱。全厂职工学习江泽民同志的国庆讲话后，既认清当前形势的严峻，又看到治理整顿的必要性和重要性，克服消极被动和无所作为的思想，决心奋战第四季度，努力实现今年生产13.5万辆汽车的任务。
    10月30日，二汽召开厂务扩大会，制定了一系列措施。中心是加强计划、财务管理，开展“双增双节”运动。要紧缩各项开支，降低成本。要进一步清理压缩基建工程，集中力量保国家重点项目EQ153型8吨平头柴油车上马。
    供应部门反映，最近材料供应有所缓和，部分钢材价格回落，这表明治理整顿初见成效。二汽领导要求充分利用这一有利条件，灵活经营，将明年材料库存压缩46天，以减少流动资金的占用。在市场紧缩的情况下，二汽用更好的售后技术工作和优质服务来扩大市场占有率。销售部门已派出20多名有经验的干部分赴各地指导加强销售工作。
    近几年来，二汽每年都有新的车型投产。二汽领导指出，技术开发是在激烈竞争中取胜的根本，要求技术开发中心紧急动员，全力以赴，加快二代新产品EQ153，EQ140—2的生产准备，力争如期投放市场。并立即着手第三代产品EQ140—3的开发研制工作。
