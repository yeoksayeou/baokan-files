This year marks the 80th birthday of Comrade Yuan Muzhi, but he has already left us for 11 years. He dedicated nearly half a century to the liberation and construction of the Chinese people, and to the progressive cause of drama and film. In his later years, he suffered persecution at the hands of the "Gang of Four." Fortunately, he passed away in 1978, witnessing the downfall of the "Gang of Four" and the dawn of reform and opening up. The Party and the people recognized his contributions to the drama and film industry.

In 1928, I saw him perform in a play at the Xin You Drama Society. At that time, he was already a famous actor. The Xin You Drama Society, led by Comrade Zhu Xinheng, was a distinctive drama troupe that advocated the "difficult play movement"—performing plays that were generally considered difficult. They performed plays by Chekhov and Gogol, emphasizing performance art and improvement through practice. Therefore, some people at the time said they were "art for art's sake." However, by 1929, both Zhu Xinheng and Yuan Muzhi underwent significant changes in their thoughts and politics. In 1930, they both joined the "Left-Wing Dramatists' Alliance," and from then on, he worked wholeheartedly under the Party's leadership. In 1931, Comrade Zhu Xinheng bravely left his happy family and secretly went to the Soviet Union to work at the Moscow Little Theater. Therefore, Yuan Muzhi also expressed to me several times his hope to go to the Soviet Union to study. The 1930s were the most severe period of white terror. After 1932, revolutionary dramas could no longer be performed in theaters, so he bravely went to schools and factories to perform. After the establishment of the Party-led film group in 1933, he and comrades such as Zheng Junli, Jin Yan, Bai Yang, and Zhao Dan successively joined the progressive film industry. He directed and starred in films such as "Life and Death in Love," "The Plunder of Peach and Plum," "Street Angel," and "Children of Troubled Times." The national anthem of the People's Republic of China, "March of the Volunteers," was the theme song of "Children of Troubled Times."

When the War of Resistance Against Japan began, most of the drama and film workers in Shanghai joined the "Anti-Enemy Drama Troupe" and the "Warzone Service Corps." Yuan Muzhi, however, obtained Pan Hannian's approval and quietly went to Yan'an. He then joined the Eighth Route Army General Political Department Film Team and shot the documentary "Yan'an and the Eighth Route Army." In 1940, he joined the Communist Party of China. To complete the post-production work of this documentary, he went to the Soviet Union. At that time, Zhu Xinheng had already perished in the Great Purge in the Soviet Union, and the German fascists had invaded the Soviet Union. He spent 5 difficult years in the Soviet Union during the Great Patriotic War until the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. He then returned to the Northeast Liberation Area and became the director of the first film studio in the liberated area—the Northeast Film Studio. Just before the liberation of the entire country, I met him again in Beijing. After the founding of New China, he became the first director of the Film Bureau of the Central People's Government and made significant contributions to the film industry of New China.

Comrade Yuan Muzhi was a courageous explorer and practitioner in the arts. He valued performance art, was strict with himself, and was never satisfied with his achievements. I clearly remember that after watching the rough cut of "Children of Troubled Times," he and Su Huimin came to see me, expressing deep dissatisfaction with his own performance. However, under the circumstances at the time, it was impossible to completely reshoot the film, so we discussed with the production team and could only reshoot and edit parts of it.

In the vast river of history, the 20th century was a time of great change for China, with political, economic, and cultural transformations and significant progress. Comrade Yuan Muzhi struggled through this era, dedicating his life to exploring a path for the arts to serve the people and socialism.

In 1952, after leaving the Film Bureau, he was plagued by illness. The Ministry of Culture even received reports of his critical condition. However, before the Cultural Revolution, when I last saw him, he showed me a film script he had written, totaling several hundred thousand words. He was still diligently writing a film script themed on the history of Chinese national culture. At that time, some people said he was "out of touch" and "overreaching," but his spirit of never giving up and continuing to fight is still fresh in my memory.

Due to illness, I cannot attend the memorial gathering for Yuan Muzhi. These few words are to express my remembrance and sorrow for this old comrade-in-arms with whom I worked for decades.

    怀念袁牧之同志
    夏衍
    今年是袁牧之同志80寿辰，但是，他离开我们已经11年了，他为中国人民的解放和建设，为进步的戏剧电影事业辛勤地工作了近半个世纪，他在晚年又遭受到“四人帮”的迫害，值得庆幸的是，他是在1978年去世的，他看到了“四人帮”的覆灭，他盼到了改革开放的曙光，党和人民确认了他对话剧电影事业所作出的劳绩。
    1928年，我就看过他在辛酉剧社演出的话剧，当时他已经是一位有名的演员了。辛酉剧社是朱穰丞同志主持的一个很有特色的话剧团体，他们提倡“难剧运动”——就是演一般人认为难演的话剧。他们演过契诃夫、果戈里的话剧，他们重视表演艺术，强调从实践中提高，因此当时也有人说他们是“为艺术而艺术”，可是到1929年，朱穰丞和袁牧之同志在思想、政治上都发生了剧烈的变化。1930年他们一同参加了“左翼戏剧家联盟”，从这时候起他就全心全意地在党的领导下工作。1931年，朱穰丞同志毅然抛弃了美满的家庭，秘密地去了苏联，在莫斯科小剧场工作。因此袁牧之同志也不止一次向我提出，希望能到苏联去学习。三十年代是白色恐怖最严重的时期，1932年以后，革命话剧不能在剧场演出了，他就不顾危险，经常到学校和工厂去作巡回演出。1933年党领导的电影小组成立之后，他和郑君里、金焰、白杨、赵丹等同志先后参加了进步电影工作。他执导和主演了《生死同心》、《桃李劫》、《马路天使》、《风云儿女》等影片，解放后成为代国歌的《义勇军进行曲》，就是《风云儿女》的主题歌。
    抗日战争开始，在上海的戏剧电影工作者大部分都参加了“抗敌演剧队”和“战地服务团”，而袁牧之同志则得到了潘汉年同志的同意，悄然地去了延安。接着他参加了八路军总政治部电影团，拍摄了纪录片《延安和八路军》。1940年他加入了中国共产党，为了完成这部纪录片的后期工作，他到了苏联。这时朱穰丞同志已在苏联大清洗中牺牲，又碰上了德国法西斯侵略苏联。他在苏联卫国战争时期艰难地度过了5年，直到抗日战争胜利以后，回到东北解放区，他是解放区第一个电影制片厂——东北电影制片厂的厂长。全国解放前夕，我才在北平和他重新见面。新中国成立之后，他又是中央人民政府文化部的第一任电影局局长，为新中国电影事业作出了很大的贡献。
    袁牧之同志是一位勇于探索、勇于实践的艺术家，他重视表演艺术，严于律己，从不满足于已取得的成就。我清楚地记得，他看了《风云儿女》样片之后，和司徒慧敏一起来找我，对于他自己的表演深感不满，但在当时的情况下，要完全重拍是不可能的，我们和摄制组商量之后，只能作了部分的重拍和剪辑。
    在浩荡的历史长河中，对中国来说，二十世纪是一个最伟大的变革时代，政治、经济、文化都发生了划时代的变化和取得了巨大的进步，牧之同志就在这样一个时代艰辛跋涉，为了探索一条文艺为人民服务、为社会主义服务的道路而奋斗终生。
    1952年他离开了电影局之后，病魔一直缠扰着他，文化部还接到过他的病危的报告，但是在“文革”前夕，我和他最后一次见面的时候，他还给我看了一份他已经写了几十万字的电影剧本。他还是孜孜不倦地在写一部以中华民族文化发展史为主题的电影剧本。当时就有人说他“不合时宜”，“自不量力”，但他那种生命不息，战斗不止的精神，对我还是记忆犹新。
    我因病不能参加纪念袁牧之的集会，讲这几句话，聊表我对这位一起工作过几十年的老战友的怀念和哀思。
