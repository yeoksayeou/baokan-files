Taiwan's year-end election is approaching, and each candidate is pulling out all the stops for the final sprint. The island is in the midst of a fierce "election battle."

This election is the first one held in Taiwan since the lifting of martial law and the lifting of bans on newspapers and political parties. It is also the most competitive election in Taiwan in 40 years, with a large number of candidates and intense party competition. Some people in Taiwan are touting this "election" as being "fair, just, and open," hoping that through this "election," Taiwan's so-called "democracy ship" can set sail smoothly. Unfortunately, the statements and actions that have emerged before and during the election, such as some candidates blatantly advocating for "Taiwan independence," advocating for the division of the country, using violence, and engaging in vote-buying, cannot be described as anything other than genuinely "anti-democratic" acts.

In this election, more than 700 people are vying for nearly 300 seats in the Legislative Yuan, county and city mayors, and provincial and municipal "representatives." With so many candidates and so few seats, candidates are not hesitant to use all kinds of "weapons," with money and violence being the two most common. According to reports, as the election situation intensifies, various districts are now reporting vote-buying scandals. Candidates either give money to voters, give gifts, or make promises, or reveal stock tips. In short, the methods of vote-buying are varied. Those who give gifts include gold rings, colorful pots, thermos bottles, liquor, ginseng, and the like; those who give money range from 3,000, 2,000, 1,000, or 500, 300, 200 yuan per vote. A Taiwanese scholar lamented, "Elections determined by bribes, it's enough to make one cry without tears."

Reports say that some candidates even rely on "triad" forces for vote-buying. Triads involved in elections inevitably use violence. Of course, the rampant use of violence is also related to the deterioration of social order on the island, the prevalence of money politics, and the pervasive utilitarian and speculative mindset. In the past month, there have been frequent reports of candidates being threatened and extorted, campaign headquarters, propaganda vehicles, and billboards being maliciously damaged; a candidate for the Legislative Yuan in Changhua County was shot, and the police and environmental protection personnel in Tainan City were violently attacked while confiscating illegal campaign materials, which is shocking. The *United Daily News* published an article saying that if this situation continues to deteriorate, Taiwan's so-called "democratic politics" will surely turn red, and the public will face the arrival of a "terrorist democracy" era.

Undoubtedly, this "election" in Taiwan is a redistribution of political power and even economic power. Currently, there are 39 political parties on the island, with 19 parties recommending candidates to participate in the election. In addition to the competition between different political interest groups within the Kuomintang and the Democratic Progressive Party, there are many other forces such as factions, families, conglomerates, associations, religions, and triads involved. Candidates, in order to achieve their personal goals, are all attacking each other, resulting in a flurry of open and secret letters, or spreading rumors and slandering, or exposing personal secrets, and so on. A Taiwanese newspaper commented that if such vicious election tactics continue to deteriorate, then the basic functions and purposes of "democratic politics" to integrate party differences and absorb diverse talents through elections will be lost.

Another even more appalling scene in this Taiwanese election is the blatant appearance of "Taiwan independence" actions on the election stage.

Just as the election situation in Taiwan is tense on the eve of voting, several Taiwanese newspapers openly published a so-called "constitution draft" for the establishment of a "Republic of Taiwan," and at the same time, a "New National Line" was established by a group of "legislators" and provincial and municipal "representatives" candidates from the Democratic Progressive Party, with "new country, new constitution" as the election appeal. It is clear that the intention of the "constitution draft" and the "New National Line" is to turn this election, which is originally just a competition for public office, into a referendum on the so-called "constitution" or even "Taiwan independence" at a certain level.

The "Constitution of the Republic of Taiwan" and the "New National Line" advocate abandoning the "illusion of Chinese consciousness," separating Taiwan from a unified China, and establishing the so-called "Eastern Switzerland, Taiwan Country." Such acts of betraying the motherland and splitting the country, the relevant "independence" figures claim to be within the scope of freedom of speech, and no one has the right to interfere. The Taiwanese authorities, who claim to be "opposing the split of the country," also have some reservations and do not take decisive action to suppress it.

Taiwanese legal scholars pointed out that advocating the establishment of the "Republic of Taiwan" and publishing it in the media has constituted the preparatory nature of "splitting the country" and the intention of "treasonous propaganda." In fact, the "Taiwan independence" advocacy is not only unacceptable and unsupported by the people on the island, but even within the Democratic Progressive Party, there are many who are hesitant or strongly question it. Therefore, "freedom of speech" should not be used as an excuse for the Taiwanese authorities to tolerate "Taiwan independence." The "freedom of speech" that splits the country and betrays the motherland is certainly not what "democratic politics" should be about. If the Taiwanese authorities are concerned that "acting according to law" will cause more backlash from the relevant parties, thereby affecting the election results of the ruling party, then the Taiwanese authorities are purely for the private interests of one party and disregard the interests of the entire Chinese nation.

Recently, the Kuomintang authorities, under public pressure, have had some high-ranking officials come forward to criticize "Taiwan independence" as "illegal." However, looking at the authorities' various actions to create an independent political entity, isn't it a clear sign to the world that they are playing tricks with "democratic politics"?

Currently, Taiwan's election is nearing its end. One scholar analyzed that Taiwan's election is a game for the rich. As long as a person has a large sum of money, they have the hope of being elected as a "legislator" or "representative" and mixing in the so-called democratic hall for three or four years; on the other hand, those without money must rely on some force or conglomerate, carefully hiding their own positions and views, and willingly serve this force or conglomerate, only then is there a chance to enter the dragon gate through the election. This is indeed to the point.

In fact, the key to winning an election in Taiwan is mainly through several types of votes: votes from group or party supporters, known as "iron votes," relationship votes, policy votes, and votes completely converted by money. "Iron votes" are top-down directive votes and are a concrete manifestation of obedience to party will and opposition to public will. Relationship votes, such as geographical and blood ties, are also not true public will votes. Policy votes are votes cast by voters who identify with the candidate's policies. According to reports, most Taiwanese voters do not care about policies, as evidenced by the recent cold and sparsely attended policy meetings held by various candidates. Therefore, those who win by policy votes are rare, and the true winning votes are the other three types. In this way, what is Taiwan's "democratic election"? Those with discerning eyes can see through it.

### “民主政治”的反民主性——台湾年底“大选”评析

　　“民主政治”的反民主性
　　——台湾年底“大选”评析
　　本报记者　姚小敏
    台湾年底选举投票在即，每位候选人正使出浑身解数作最后冲刺。岛内呈现一派激烈的“选战”景象。
    此次选举是台湾解除戒严与开放报禁党禁后的第一次选举，也是台湾40年来参选人数众多、党派争夺激烈的一次“大选”。台湾有些人鼓吹这次“大选”的“公平、公正、公开”，企望借着此次“大选”，能够使台湾这条所谓的“民主之船”顺利地下水扬帆。然而不幸，选前活动乃至选举过程中出现的一系列言论和行为，诸如一些候选人肆意鼓吹“台独”、主张分裂国土，使用暴力，进行贿选等等，不能不说是地地道道的“反民主”行径。
    台湾这次选举，700余人争夺增额“立委”、县市长、省市“议员”近300个席位，粥少僧多。为达目的，候选人便不惜用上各类“武器”，金钱和暴力即是惯用的两种。据报道，随着选举形势的激化，目前各地选区均传出贿选丑闻。候选人给选民或送钱，或赠物，或开列期约，或报知股票明牌。总之，贿选方式五花八门。赠物者，有金戒指、彩色锅、热水瓶、洋酒、人参之类；送钱者，则每票3000、2000、1000或500、300、200元不等。台湾一学者叹道：“选以贿成，真令人欲哭无泪了。”
    报道说，候选人进行贿选，有的还借力于“黑道”势力。黑道涉入选举，就不免使用暴力。当然，暴力的横行与岛内社会治安的恶化、金钱游戏盛行、功利及投机心理弥漫亦有关。近一个月来，候选人遭到恐吓勒索，竞选总部、宣传车、海报牌受到恶意破坏的案件频频传出；彰化县“立委”候选人遭枪击，台南市警方及环保人员取缔违规宣传品遭暴力攻击，更是触目惊心。《联合报》载文说，假如这一情势继续恶化，台湾所谓的“民主政治”必然亮起红灯，而民众面对的也必然是一个“恐怖民主”时代的来临。
    台湾这次“大选”，无疑是一次政治权力乃至经济权力的再分配。目前岛内39个政党中有19个党派推荐出候选人参与竞选。除了国民党中的不同政治利益群体与民进党中的不同政治利益群体之间的竞争外，还有许多力量诸如派系、家族、财团、社团、宗教、帮会等介入其中。候选人为达到一己的目的，纷纷相互攻讦，以致明函黑函纷纷出笼，或造谣诽谤，或揭人隐私，不一而足。台报评论道，如此恶质化的选战手段若继续恶化下去，则“民主政治”透过选举整合党派歧见、吸纳多样人才的基本功能与宗旨将丧失殆尽。
    台湾这次选举中，另一种更为恶劣的景象便是“台独”言行赤裸裸地在选举竞技场上登场。
    正当台湾选情紧绷的投票前夕，台湾几家报纸公然刊登了一部号称要建立“台湾共和国”的“基本法草案”，而同时，由民进党部分“立委”省市“议员”候选人连署的“新国家联线”也紧跟着成立，以“新国家、新宪法”作为选举诉求。很明显，“基本法草案”及“新国家联线”的企图是要让这场原本只是公职人员竞逐的选举，在某种层次上变成一场对所谓“基本法”或者干脆就是对“台湾独立”的公民投票。
      “台湾共和国基本法草案”和“新国家联线”主张扬弃“虚幻的中国意识”，将台湾割裂在一个统一的中国之外，建立所谓“东方瑞士台湾国”。此种背叛祖国、分裂国家的行径，有关“独派”人士竟然说是言论自由范围内的政治主张，任何人无权干涉。而声称一贯“反对国土分裂”的台湾当局也有所顾忌而不予以坚决取缔。
    台湾法学界人士指出，主张建立“台湾共和国”，并刊登在媒体报章上，已构成“分裂国土”叛乱之预备性质，已有为“叛国宣传”之故意。实际上，“台独”主张不仅岛内民众无法认同、支持，即连民进党内部亦多犹豫观望或提出强烈质疑。所以，“言论自由”不应成为台湾当局纵容“台独”的借口。分裂国家、背叛祖国的“言论自由”，总不是“民主政治”题中应有之义吧？如果说台湾当局是担心“依法办事”会引起有关人士更大反弹，从而影响执政党的选举结果，则台湾当局纯粹是为了一党私利而置中华民族全体利益于不顾了。
    日前，国民党当局迫于舆论压力，一些高层人士也出面指责“台独”“违法”，但纵观当局热衷于搞独立的政治实体的种种作为，岂不是向世人昭示其言行不一，不过是在玩弄“民主政治”的花招？
    目前，台湾选举已近尾声。一学者分析道，台湾的选举，是有钱人的游戏。一个人只要有大笔金钱，就有希望选上“立委”或“议员”，在所谓民主殿堂混上三四年；相反地，无钱的人，就必须攀附上某种势力或财团，小心翼翼地隐藏起自己的立场与见解，甘心为这一势力或财团服务，才有靠选举晋身龙门的可能。此可谓切中要害。
    其实，台湾的选举获胜，大抵凭借着这样几种票源：团体或政党认同者之票即所谓“铁票”、关系票、政见票和完全金钱转化的票。“铁票”是由上而下的指令性票源，是服从党意对抗民意的具体表现。关系票即地缘、血缘票，也不是真正的民意票。政见票则是选民认同候选人政见而投的票。据报道，台湾的选民大多不关心政见，日前各候选人举办的政见会冷冷清清听众寥寥即可为证。因此，凭政见票获胜者极少，真正获胜的票源是另外三种。如此，台湾“民主选举”为何物，明眼人一看就透。
