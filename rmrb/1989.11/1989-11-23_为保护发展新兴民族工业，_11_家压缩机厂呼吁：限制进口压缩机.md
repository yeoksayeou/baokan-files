To protect and develop the emerging domestic compressor industry, 11 compressor factories have called for:

Restrict Imports of Compressors

Domestically produced refrigerator compressors have already exceeded market demand. If large quantities are imported, it will inevitably severely impact the emerging domestic compressor industry. There are already over 40 refrigerator compressor factories in the country, but currently, 7 enterprises are still preparing to start production.

Recently, 11 domestic refrigerator compressor production companies gathered in Xi'an and jointly issued a call: To protect and develop the emerging domestic industry, it is necessary to strictly restrict the import of compressors.

This year, the production capacity of domestic compressors has increased to 3 million units. However, due to the blind import of compressors, major domestic designated factories have been forced to reduce or stop production. This year, domestic machines can produce at most 2.6 million units, with most of them piled up in warehouses. It is estimated that the market demand for refrigerators next year will not exceed 5 million units, while the production capacity of domestic compressors can exceed 5.6 million units. If production is carried out according to capacity, combined with the 2 million units of refrigerators and over 1 million units of compressors in stock this year, as well as the planned 2.87 million imported units entering the market, compressors will far exceed the demand for refrigerator matching. If compressors are imported next year, it will deal a fatal blow to the emerging domestic compressor industry.

The 11 compressor production companies believe that the compressor production technology introduced by our country has a high starting point. Most of the production lines and products are at the international level of the 1980s. The performance indicators of compressors are significantly better than those produced in Thailand, Brazil, France, South Korea, and Taiwan. Some indicators have reached or even surpassed those of compressors produced in Italy and Japan, and they also have the advantage of convenient after-sales service that imported machines cannot match. Although domestic machines still have the problem of unstable quality, this can be solved through national support and internal management improvements.

“Strictly restricting the import of compressors not only saves the country a large amount of precious foreign exchange but also benefits the development of the domestic industry.” The 11 companies stated in a report submitted to relevant national departments that since 1984, the state has invested over 1.8 billion yuan to support 21 compressor factories. If the production capacity is fully realized, 13.36 million units of compressors can be produced annually, adding 5.6 billion yuan in production value for the country.

They pointed out that although the production capacity of domestic compressors has already exceeded market demand and there are over 40 production companies, there are still 7 enterprises that are in the process of approval or trial production, preparing to start production.

They call on relevant departments to strengthen macro-control. While making necessary adjustments to the factories that have been built and put into production, measures should be taken to prevent new projects from starting.

　　为保护发展新兴民族工业，11家压缩机厂呼吁：
　　限制进口压缩机
    国产冰箱压缩机目前已超过市场需要，若再大量进口，势必沉重打击新兴的国产压缩机行业；国内已有40多家冰箱压缩机厂，但现在仍有7家企业准备上马。
    国内11家冰箱压缩机生产厂家最近在西安聚会，联合发出呼吁：为了保护发展新兴的民族工业，必须严格限制压缩机进口。
    今年国产压缩机的生产能力已提高到300万台，然而，由于盲目进口压缩机，国内主要定点厂纷纷被迫减产、停产，今年国产机最多只能生产260万台，其中多数积压在仓库里。据预测，明年市场冰箱需求量最多不超过500万台，而国产压缩机生产能力可超过560万台。如果按生产能力生产，加上今年200万台冰箱和100多万台压缩机的库存，以及计划的287万台进口机投放市场，压缩机将大大超过冰箱配套需求。如果明年再进口压缩机，将给新兴的国产压缩机行业一个致命打击。
    11个压缩机生产厂家认为，我国立项引进的压缩机生产技术起点高，大部分生产线和产品都是国际80年代的水平，压缩机的各种性能指标明显比泰国、巴西、法国、南朝鲜、台湾等生产的压缩机高出一筹，有的指标已达到甚至超过意大利、日本等国生产的名牌机，同时还有进口机无法比拟的售后服务方便的优点。虽然国产机还有质量不够稳定的问题，但是，可以通过国家支持和内部加强管理来解决。
      “严格限制压缩机进口，不仅可以为国家节约大量宝贵的外汇，而且有利于民族工业的发展。”这11个厂家在给国家有关部门提供的一份报告中说，1984年以来，国家共投资18亿余元，扶持了21家压缩机厂，如果实现全部生产能力，每年可生产1336万台压缩机，为国家新增产值56亿元。
    他们指出，尽管现在国产压缩机生产能力已超过市场需求，生产厂家已多达40多家，但是，现在还有7家企业仍在立项或试制，准备上马。
    他们呼吁有关部门要加强宏观控制，在对目前已建成投产的厂家进行必要调整的同时，采取措施阻止新增项目上马。本报记者  孟西安
