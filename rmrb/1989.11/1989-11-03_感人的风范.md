On October 16, 1989, a hearse carrying the remains of an old soldier of the New Fourth Army, who had participated in the revolution for over 50 years, slowly entered the Beijing Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery crematorium. There was no funeral music, no wreaths, no memorial service, and apart from a few family members and staff, there was no long line of mourners.

Two hours later, his ashes were placed in a red cloth bag and taken home by his eldest son. According to his wishes, the ashes would be scattered into the Yellow River and flow towards the sea.

This old soldier of the New Fourth Army was Lin Zhen, a retired cadre and former senior military advisor to the Air Force Logistics Department, who passed away on October 10.

Last June, he suddenly experienced severe pain in his stomach, which had been bothering him for a long time. The diagnosis of "late-stage stomach cancer" led him to the operating table. Before the surgery, he actively cooperated with the medical staff in preparing, and quietly wrote his will.

He instructed his wife and children, "Many revolutionary martyrs gave their blood and flesh without any compensation to the cause of liberating the Chinese people. They not only did not see the victory of the revolution but also did not see what socialism is like. We are the survivors and should strive to be better." The will also made arrangements for his funeral: "1. Do not issue an obituary; 2. Do not hold a funeral; 3. Do not hold a memorial service; 4. Do not keep the ashes; 5. If necessary, the body can be autopsied."

After Lin Zhen passed away, according to his wishes, all funeral activities were kept simple. His wife and children, with heavy hearts, actively cooperated with the organization in handling the funeral, making no demands or conditions. When the leadership asked for their opinions on handling the funeral, they expressed that they would respect the will of their loved one and follow the organization's arrangements. When asked if other relatives and friends should be notified, Lin Zhen's wife, Liu Hua, who joined the revolution during the War of Resistance, sincerely said, "Everyone is busy, so don't send obituaries to relatives and friends in Beijing and other places. This way, it won't affect their work and will also reduce the burden on the organization." The old comrades from Lin Zhen's former party cell heard the news and came to his home. They saw a simple living room with Lin Zhen's portrait hanging, no funeral hall, no urn, and no wreaths and condolence messages.

Liu Hua, with tears in her eyes, said, "He often said in his lifetime that after his death, there should be no complicated procedures and no extravagance. He always demanded this of himself."

He often wore an old, worn-out military uniform and soldier's cloth shoes, with socks mended over and over again. When his wife suggested he get a new pair, he would say, "They can still be worn." On his old-style desk, there was a small rectangular mirror fixed with plastic string and adhesive tape to the rusted and broken four frames. Liu Hua introduced, "This was a trophy given to him by the leader in 1945 and has been used until now. When it broke, he fixed it himself and still took it with him on business trips."

In terms of using cars, he was even stricter with himself and his family. His home was 2 kilometers away from the office. Since 1970, whether he was the deputy director of the logistics department or a senior military advisor, he insisted on walking to and from work every season. Someone asked him why he didn't take the car when he had one. He jokingly said, "It exercises the body and saves gasoline, why not?"

    感人的风范
    孙茂庆　程立民　梁德智
    1989年10月16日，灵车载着一位参加革命50多年的新四军老战士的遗体，缓缓地驶进北京八宝山革命公墓火化场。没有哀乐，没有花圈，没有追悼仪式，除几名家属和工作人员外，也没有长长的告别队伍。
    两个小时以后，他的骨灰装在红布袋里，由其长子捧回家中。按照他的遗愿，骨灰将撒到黄河，奔向大海。
    这位新四军老战士，就是10月10日病逝的离休干部、空军后勤部原正军职顾问林震同志。
    去年6月，他突感长期不适的胃部剧痛难忍。“胃癌晚期”的诊断，使他躺上了手术台。手术前，他积极配合医护人员做好准备工作，并悄悄地写下了遗嘱。
    他嘱咐爱人和孩子：“许多革命先烈以血肉毫无代价地贡献给中国人民的解放事业，不仅没有看到革命的胜利，更没有看到社会主义是什么样子。我们是幸存者，应该自勉。”遗嘱对自己的后事也做了安排：“1、不发讣告；2、不搞遗体告别；3、不开追悼会；4、不保留骨灰；5、如有用处可作尸检。”
    林震同志病逝后，按照他的遗愿，一切治丧活动从简。妻子子女怀着悲痛心情积极配合组织处理丧事，没提任何要求和条件。在领导征询丧事处理意见时，他们表示，尊重亲人遗嘱，听从组织安排。当问到是否通知其他亲友时，林震的爱人、抗战时期参加革命的刘华诚恳地说，大家都很忙，不要向京内外的亲戚、友好发讣告了，免得影响他们的工作，也减轻组织的负担。林震生前所在党小组的老同志闻讯来到他家，只见简朴的客厅挂着林震同志的遗像，没有灵堂，没有骨灰盒，没有花圈挽联。
    刘华同志流着眼泪说：“他生前多次讲过，我死以后，不要繁琐，不能铺张。他平时总是这样要求自己的。”
    他经常身着的确凉旧军装，脚穿士兵布鞋，粗线袜子补了又补。老伴劝他换双新的，他总是说“还能穿”。在他的老式写字台上有一面长方形小镜子，上面用塑料绳和橡皮膏固定着生锈脱焊的四框。刘华同志介绍说：“这是1945年领导奖给他的战利品，一直用到现在，坏了自己动手修，出差还照样带着。”
    在用车上，他更是严格要求自己和家属。他家距机关2公里，从1970年起，无论是当后勤部副部长，还是任正军职顾问，他一年四季都坚持步行上下班。有人问他，为什么有车不坐？他风趣地说：“既锻炼了身体，又节约了汽油，何乐而不为呢。”
