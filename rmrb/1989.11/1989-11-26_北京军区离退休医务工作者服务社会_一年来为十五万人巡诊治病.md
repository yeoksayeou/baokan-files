Retired medical personnel of the Beijing Military Region have been serving various sectors of society. Over the past year, they have provided medical examinations and treatments for more than 150,000 people, alleviating the difficulties local residents face in accessing medical care.

They organized six expert health examination teams to conduct mobile health checks. Following the principle of prevention first, these teams went to factories and rural areas, conducting comprehensive health examinations for over 46,000 people. They identified 23,000 individuals with various diseases and promptly developed treatment plans.

They established five specialized expert clinics, providing specialized treatments in areas of Beijing where medical resources are scarce. The Tang Peifu clinic in Fengtai uses an innovative "energy point acupuncture therapy" to treat conditions such as allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The Li Deqing clinic in Tongxian uses qigong and ear acupuncture to treat chronic and common diseases, achieving notable results.

Retired medical personnel of the Beijing Military Region have also conducted in-depth investigations into diseases like coronary heart disease and calculi, exploring regional differences in disease prevalence and developing preventive measures.

　　北京军区离退休医务工作者服务社会
　　一年来为十五万人巡诊治病
    本报讯　北京军区离退休医务工作者协会服务社会各界，1年多来为15万余名群众巡诊治病，缓解了地方群众就医难的矛盾。
    他们组织了6个专家体检队，进行巡回健康检查。体检队本着预防为主的原则深入工厂农村，对4.6万多名群众进行了系统的体检，发现患有各类疾病的人2.3万余名，及时制定了治疗方案。
    他们成立了5个具有特色的专家门诊部，在京郊医疗网点较少的地方开展了专科治疗。丰台门诊部的谭培福大夫独创了“能量点穴疏经疗法”，医治过敏性哮喘、过敏性鼻炎、风湿性关节炎，通县门诊部李德庆大夫用气功、耳针治疗慢性病常见病多发病，都收到显著效果。
    北京军区离退休医务工作者还通过对冠心病、结石症等进行专题调查，探讨出不同地区的发病差异，从而研究出防病措施。　（张梅珍）
