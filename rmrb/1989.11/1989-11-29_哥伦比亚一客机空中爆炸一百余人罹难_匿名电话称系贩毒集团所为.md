A Colombian airplane exploded in mid-air, resulting in over 100 fatalities. An anonymous caller claimed the incident was orchestrated by a drug trafficking organization.

Our reporter, Zhu Manting, reports from Caracas on November 28: A Boeing 727-100 aircraft belonging to Avianca Airlines exploded yesterday over the outskirts of the capital, Bogota. All 107 passengers on board were killed.

The aircraft took off from Bogota's international airport at 7:13 AM, bound for Cali. Just minutes after takeoff, the plane exploded over an industrial area about 20 kilometers south of Bogota. Witnesses reported that the plane was flying normally when it suddenly exploded, breaking into two parts and crashing while engulfed in flames and thick smoke. Police were immediately dispatched to the crash site for investigation. The head of the Cundinamarca Police Department stated that, so far, there is no evidence to suggest this was a terrorist attack.

Following the incident, an anonymous caller contacted a radio station, claiming that the crash was orchestrated by the armed wing of the Medellin drug cartel, known as "Los Extraditables." The caller stated, "We, 'Los Extraditables,' ordered the plane to be blown up to eliminate 5 informants (snitches)." These five informants had provided the police with the hiding places of the drug cartel's top leader, Escobar, and others. Last week, Colombian police conducted a raid and discovered a secret hideout of Escobar and his associates. Escobar narrowly escaped capture, while 55 of his accomplices were arrested.

　　哥伦比亚一客机空中爆炸一百余人罹难
　　匿名电话称系贩毒集团所为
    本报加拉加斯11月28日电　记者朱满庭报道：哥伦比亚航空公司的一架波音727—100型客机昨天在首都波哥大郊区上空爆炸，机上107人全部罹难。
    这架客机是昨天上午7点13分从首都波哥大国际机场起飞飞往卡利市的，起飞几分钟后，飞机在波哥大南郊20多公里处的工业区上空突然爆炸。目击者说，飞机在正常飞行中，突然爆炸，分成两节，然后裹着火焰和浓烟坠落。警方立即派员前往出事地点进行调查。昆迪纳马卡省警察局负责人表示，到目前为止没有迹象说明这是一次恐怖袭击事件。
    事件发生后，一家电台接到匿名电话，说这次空难是麦德林贩毒集团的武装组织“可引渡者”制造的。这个匿名电话称，“我们‘可引渡者’命令炸掉这架飞机是要杀死5只蛤蟆
  （告密者）”。这5个告密者向警方提供了贩毒集团最大头目埃斯科瓦尔等人的隐藏地点。上星期，哥伦比亚警方在一次围剿行动中，找到了埃斯科瓦尔等人的一个秘密据点。埃斯科瓦尔差一点被抓获，他的55名同伙落网。
