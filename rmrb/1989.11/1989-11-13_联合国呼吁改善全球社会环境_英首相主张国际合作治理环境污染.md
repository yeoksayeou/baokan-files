The United Nations General Assembly's Third Committee passed a resolution on November 9, calling on the international community to take necessary measures and mobilize all forces to help improve the global social environment.

The resolution reflects the deep concern of people over the deteriorating social and economic environments in Third World countries.

The resolution points out that developing countries are currently facing multiple challenges, including severe fluctuations in exchange rates and commodity prices, high interest rates, deteriorating trade conditions, increasing trade protectionism, and heavy debt burdens. Moreover, these problems are becoming increasingly serious.

The resolution reaffirmed the principles and goals of the United Nations in the areas of social progress and economic development, and called on all member states to strive to achieve the targets set in their respective national development plans.

Our reporter Liu Kai Chen reported from the United Nations: British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called for the formulation of a global action plan to protect the global environment during her speech at the 44th session of the United Nations General Assembly on November 8.

Thatcher pointed out that "the main threats to our environment are the increasing population and human activities," such as clearing large tracts of land, deforesting tropical forests, using large amounts of fuel, and severely polluting rivers and seas. These activities will lead to future global climate change.

She advocated for strengthening international cooperation, utilizing existing institutions such as the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme to address global environmental issues. She suggested that before the World Environment and Development Conference in 1992, countries should consult and draft a global convention on climate change and a global convention on the conservation of animal and plant species as guidelines for environmental protection.

Thatcher concluded by discussing Britain's contributions and plans in protecting the global environment and announced that Britain would donate 100 million pounds for the protection of tropical forests over the next three years.

    联合国呼吁改善全球社会环境
    英首相主张国际合作治理环境污染
    新华社联合国电　联大第三委员会9日通过一项决议，呼吁国际社会采取必要措施，动员一切力量，帮助改善全球社会环境。
    这项决议突出反映了人们对第三世界国家日益恶化的社会、经济环境的深切关注。
    决议指出，发展中国家目前面临汇率和商品价格大幅度波动、高利率、贸易条件严重恶化、贸易保护主义加剧和债务负担等多方面的困境，而且这种情形变的日趋严重。
    决议重申了联合国在社会进步和经济发展方面的原则和目标，并呼吁所有成员国为达到各自国家计划发展内的目标作出努力。
    本报联合国电　记者刘开宸报道：英国首相撒切尔夫人8日在第44届联合国大会上发表讲话，呼吁制订世界行动纲领，保护全球环境。
    撒切尔夫人指出，“我们环境的主要威胁，是越来越多的人口以及人类的活动”，例如开垦大片土地，砍伐热带森林，使用大量燃料，严重污染河、海等，这些活动会导致未来全球气候变化。
    她主张加强国际合作，利用现有的机构，如世界气候组织和联合国环境规划署的作用，以应付全球环境问题。她建议在世界环境与发展会议在1992年召开前，各国协商草拟出一项关于全球气候变化的公约和一项保存动、植物种的全球公约，做为各国在环境保护方面的行动准则。
    撒切尔夫人最后谈了英国在保护世界环境方面的贡献和计划，并宣布英国为今后3年保护热带森林活动捐款1亿英镑。
