Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 15th.

According to statistics, the total amount of women's patriotic savings nationwide has exceeded 10 billion yuan.

At the beginning of this year, the All-China Women's Federation, in collaboration with six banks including the Bank of China, issued a call to action for the "Chinese Women's Patriotic Savings" campaign. The call urged all female citizens to deposit their savings into banks to support national construction. Local women's federations assisted banks in setting up savings programs such as the "Newlywed Couples' Love Savings," "Middle-Aged and Young Couples' Evergreen Savings," and "Elderly Couples' Longevity Savings." These initiatives greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of women for patriotic savings.
