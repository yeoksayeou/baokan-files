Xinhua News Agency, Islamabad, November 15th.

Premier Li Peng and his wife, Mrs. Zhu Lin, had a friendly and cordial meeting with Pakistan's Minister of State for Information, Mrs. Nusrat Bhutto, this afternoon at the guesthouse where they are staying.

Mrs. Bhutto warmly welcomed Premier Li's visit to Pakistan.

Mrs. Bhutto mentioned, "In 1964, when Pakistan International Airlines first flew to Beijing, I led a delegation to visit China. Pakistan was the first non-socialist country to establish air links with China."

Premier Li said, "You set a record for Sino-Pakistani friendly exchanges. Sino-Pakistani friendship was jointly established by the older generation of leaders of both countries. On the Chinese side, there were Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai, and on the Pakistani side, successive leaders have made contributions, particularly your late husband, former Prime Minister Bhutto, who made great efforts to develop Sino-Pakistani friendship."

Premier Li continued, "I bring warm greetings from Deng Yingchao to you."

Mrs. Bhutto replied, "Please convey my greetings to her as well. She inquired about Deng Yingchao's recent health."

Premier Li said, "Deng Yingchao is already 85 years old, but her health is good, her mind is sharp. On the evening of October 1st, she even went to Tiananmen Gate to watch the National Day fireworks."

Premier Li also briefed Mrs. Bhutto on China's recent developments. Mrs. Bhutto expressed great satisfaction with the stability of the situation in China.

Mrs. Bhutto hopes to lead a delegation to visit China next year. Premier Li warmly welcomed this and looks forward to seeing her in Beijing.
