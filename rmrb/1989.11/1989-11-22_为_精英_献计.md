What a trick!

It has long been rumored that the "elite" who fled overseas and sought refuge with foreigners are ready to show off their skills, starting with a propaganda campaign against the Chinese government. The result? Surprisingly, they did not produce any impressive articles, but instead released a forged edition of the *People's Daily* (overseas edition). According to the commentary in the *European Times* in Paris, "except for using the name, masthead, and some headlines of the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, the entire paper is filled with rumors and slander against the Chinese government."

Any person with normal intelligence would consider this act too despicable. No wonder the *World Journal* in New York called it a "strange move." The commentary in the *European Times* even pointed out that the overseas edition of the *People's Daily* is distributed and published in France by the Guanghua Press, and this act itself is a serious infringement. But the "elite" are not ordinary people; while doing this, they have already prepared their "defense" in case they end up in court.

First, they claim that "forgery" is a "new form of struggle." It is said that this is a "clever move" to "break through the news blockade, authoritarian rule, and totalitarian regime" of the Communist Party. It can allegedly pass through customs inspections and be smuggled into the mainland, and it can also make "people living under the Communist Party's bayonets" dare to circulate, photocopy, and keep it. However, this "defense" actually reveals the forgers' true intentions: they admit that the *People's Daily* is authoritative, while the *China Democratic Alliance News* or the *Elite News* cannot see the light of day and can only temporarily not be released. Currently, this is a desperate move, and being able to get by for a while is enough, also as a report to the money masters, and to show the existence of "democracy activists."

Second, they claim that they are not afraid of the "Communist authorities suing them." The "elite" are afraid of being charged with "forgery" and being dragged to court, and they preemptively boost their morale by declaring: "The 'Justice Lawyers Group,' composed of more than 1,000 professional lawyers in the United States, will come to their aid, and the Los Angeles Human Rights Lawyers Association is also ready." Stealing someone else's property and then counterattacking is truly the logic of a bandit! The "elite" unwittingly reveal their "litigation lawyer" faces here.

As for the malicious intentions of the "elite" in forging the *People's Daily*, the *European Times* exposed: "Overseas, it is to use the authority of this Chinese party newspaper to confuse foreigners, making foreign readers who are not very familiar with China mistakenly believe that the opposition forces in China are strong enough to control the opinions of a major newspaper, thus mistakenly believing that the Chinese government is unstable... Another purpose is to play a role of bewitching and inciting people's hearts at home." According to this, I respectfully offer advice to the "elite" who have large amounts of dollars, francs, Hong Kong dollars, etc.: forging just one overseas edition of the *People's Daily* is far from enough. You should also forge the *People's Daily*, *Workers' Daily*, *Farmers' Daily*, *Liberation Army Daily*, *Guangming Daily*, and even women's and youth newspapers... This way, the momentum will be X times greater. Not only can it immediately stir up a raging fire at home; abroad, it can also create the impression that China's workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals, as well as women and youth, have all become "opposition forces." They control almost all major newspapers, and the Chinese government is already in dire straits, facing imminent collapse! In this way, it is likely to win the applause of some people in the Kuomintang in Taiwan, and you will be able to enter the island in a grand sedan chair, without having to frequently wink at the liaison personnel sent from Taiwan.

What other tricks do the "elite" have up their sleeves? Everyone, please wait and see, this is just their first appearance on stage!

　　为“精英”献计
　　何微
    真有绝活！
    早就风传逃到海外、托庇于洋人的“精英”们准备大显身手，首先要在舆论方面掀起一场针对中国政府的攻势。结果如何？大大出人意料的是，他们并没有炮制出什么像样的“高头文章”，而是抛出了一份伪造的《人民日报》（海外版）。它的“出色”之处，据巴黎《欧洲时报》评论说：“除了盗用中国共产党机关报的名义、报头和部分标题外，满纸是攻击、污蔑中国政府的谣言和谰言。”
    恐怕任何智力正常的人都会认为此举未免过于下作。无怪乎纽约《世界日报》称它是“奇招”。《欧洲时报》的评论甚至指出：中国《人民日报》海外版是由法国光华报业公司代理和发行的，是在法国注册印行的，此举本身就是严重的侵权行为。但“精英”们并非等闲之辈，他们在这样干的同时，已经准备好一旦对簿公堂时的“反驳”了。
    其一曰：“伪造”乃“新的斗争艺术”。据说这是为了“冲破中共新闻封锁、专制暴政和极权统治”的“智举”，既可蒙混通过海关检查而运进大陆，又可使“生活在中共刺刀下的人民，敢于传阅、复印、保存”。殊不知这一“反驳”，倒把伪造者的心曲露了底：实际上承认了《人民日报》是有权威的，而《中国民阵报》或《精英报》则见不得阳光，只好暂不出笼，当前出此下策实非得已，能混过一时算一时，也是对掏钱的主子有了个交代，并借此显示出“民运人士”的存在。
    其二曰：不怕“中共当局和他们打官司”。“精英”们唯恐以“伪造”罪被揪上法庭，预先自我壮胆地宣称：“由1000多名在美职业律师组成的‘正义律师团’，将施以援手，而洛杉矶人权律师协会也已作好准备。”偷了人家的东西还要反咬一口，这真是十足的强盗逻辑！“精英”们不自觉地在这里露出了“讼棍”的嘴脸。
    至于“精英”们伪造《人民日报》的险恶用心，据《欧洲时报》揭露说：“在海外，是利用这份中国党报的权威在外国人中混淆视听，使对中国不甚了解的外国读者误以为中国反对派力量强大，足以控制一份大报的言论，从而误以为中国政府是不稳定的……另一个目的是在国内……发挥蛊惑人心、煽风点火的作用。”按此，在下谨向手中握有大量美元、法郎、港币……的“精英”们献计：你们光是伪造一份《人民日报》海外版远远不够，应当再伪造《人民日报》、《工人日报》、《农民日报》、《解放军报》、《光明日报》以至妇女报、青年报……这样声势要大X倍，不但在国内可望立马煽起熊熊大火；在国外，更可以造出中国的工农兵、知识分子以及妇女、青年都成了“反对派”的印象，他们控制了几乎所有的大报，中国政府已经危如累卵，朝不保夕了！……如此，大概会博得台湾国民党某些人士的喝彩，你们坐着八抬大轿进入宝岛必将指日可待，勿须再向那些台湾派来的区区联络人员频送秋波了。
    “精英”们下面还有什么绝活，列位请翘首以待，这回还只是首次粉墨登场亮相呢！
