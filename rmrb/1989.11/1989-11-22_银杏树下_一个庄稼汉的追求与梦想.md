Title: Under the Ginkgo Tree - The Aspirations and Dreams of a Farmer

It was an ordinary mountain road.

The car was driving slowly into the mountains, its wheels still kicking up large clouds of dust, enveloping the farmers carrying loads, baskets, and shoulders with a thick haze, as if they were practicing some mysterious martial arts. A black dog suddenly dashed onto the road, standing in front of the car's hood, challenging us with its head held high. The driver honked the horn urgently and hit the brakes. The black dog, however, remained silent, staring at us for a moment before leaping off the road and leading our gaze to the recently harvested fields. The fields were beautiful and ancient, nurturing countless fleeting lives. In autumn, they still emitted a faint heat. As long as they endured the barren and desolate winter, they would offer their youthful bodies again.

Dakang Village, an ordinary northern mountain village by the roadside. The village secretary, Li Kehui, came out to greet us. I had come to see him.

Looking at the middle-aged man before me, he was not at all what I had imagined. After traveling around Jiaodong, I had met many wealthy and imposing farmers who were skilled in business and good at drinking. Seeing Li Kehui for the first time, I felt that he was more humble and straightforward than sharp and capable. His face was deeply lined, his back slightly hunched, his eyes looking down, his steps slow and somewhat clumsy, and his voice hoarse and lacking in strength. He seemed ordinary and unremarkable.

The tallest building in the village stood before us, a two-story structure costing 300,000 yuan. Compared to any hotel in Beijing, it was merely a slum, but in the small valley of Dakang Village, where generations had lived in thatched and stone houses, it stood out like a crane among chickens.

It was not the gate of a nouveau riche, nor a new factory for a village-run enterprise, nor an office for officials. It was a kindergarten. In this small mountain village with only about 200 households, there was a kindergarten.

Entering the children's world, my steps naturally lightened. The air seemed to resonate with a heart-stirring tranquility. Mama is so tired, please sit down quickly. Wipe the sweat, have a cup of tea, I'll fan you... The innocent, not very harmonious song echoed, the children were in class. Looking through the glass on the classroom door, a young female teacher was concentrating on playing the harmonium. After the song ended, we pushed the door open and were immediately fixed by a dozen pairs of bright eyes. The young teacher, a village girl, blushed like her red sweater, but did not forget to tell the children, "Uncle and Auntie, hello." On the back wall of the classroom, there was another small door leading to the dormitory, where rows of light blue wooden beds were arranged, with colorful quilts beloved by farmers, bathed in warm sunlight.

After touring the classrooms, Li Kehui led us to the boiler room. It was said that building this boiler room cost a full 800,000 yuan, used to provide heating and hot water for the children. The boiler room was not yet in use. Standing under its silver-gray body, I remembered other children I knew. In the place where I worked in the countryside, children went barefoot in summer and wore thin cotton clothes in winter, rolling and playing from morning to night. When thirsty, they drank well water; when hungry, they ate sweet potatoes. Their hands, wrists, and necks were always black and rough, and their clothes were always covered with dirt... Their brains were almost empty, and all the beautiful things of knowledge and civilization were far away from them...

"Let our village's children know how to take a bath from a young age, cultivate civilized and hygienic habits, generation after generation, and this village will be different." Li Kehui said slowly.

I was surprised by the simplicity of this thought, and even more surprised by the charm of this simple thought. Bathing, a small hygiene habit in the civilized world. For most city dwellers, bathing regularly is a natural thing, who would still discover it as a symbol of civilization, a window for a mountain village farmer to yearn for civilization?

Dakang Village is geographically quite isolated. Following the mountain road out, it is only about 40 li to the famous city of Huang County (now called Longkou City) in Jiaodong, and further on is the boundless sea. To the east, it is only about two hours by car to the beautiful coastal city of Yantai. However, the rolling hills lock Dakang in a narrow, barren, and dull valley.

Rising with the sun and resting with the sun, the people of Dakang have lived generation after generation in a self-sufficient small agricultural economy. They are satisfied with having only one primary school class, allowing children to write simple letters home and do some basic arithmetic. It seems that there are few restless individuals who would dream of surpassing reality or connecting the fate of Dakang with the not-so-distant sea, plains, and cities. What they remember and pass down from generation to generation is a legend, an ancient dream.

About 400 years ago, a failed scholar wandered here along the mountain road and planted two ginkgo trees on a small piece of flat land. Lying under the trees, the scholar dreamed of becoming the top scholar, but woke up to find it was just a dream. From some unknown time, the people of Dakang believed this was a magical "dream," that Dakang Village would one day realize this dream of becoming the top scholar. Four hundred years passed in a flash. The two ginkgo trees grew tall and wide, bearing thousands of fruits, but Dakang had not even produced a single scholar, let alone a top scholar. The dream was just a dream, but the life of the farmers became increasingly poor.

In the spring of 1978, the mountain road to Dakang was filled with sweet fragrance. White pear blossoms swayed in the spring breeze. The men of Dakang Village, with their cotton-padded clothes open, steam rising from their heads, were struggling to carry a huge object up the mountain.

What a huge punch press, shiny and black. When Li Kehui first saw it in a factory in Yantai, he was amazed. The look of surprise was noticed by the seller, who took the opportunity to say, "Others offered 10,000 yuan, but we didn't sell it. For 8,300 yuan, you can take it. It's a bargain, supporting farmers to get rich." A few sweet words were not enough to confuse Li Kehui, who had been calculating carefully for half his life, but the machine was indeed too large. "Even if we sell iron, it's worth it. They can't cheat me," Li Kehui decided, and with a bite of his teeth, he took out the bundle of banknotes.

The machine was Dakang's. It would be the key to the village's prosperity. Dakang Village was going to build a mineral processing plant, and the first bet was on it. After repeated test runs, the excitement of the people of Dakang cooled down. This big guy was not obedient. Experts were called in to look at it, and they shook their heads, saying, "It was made in 1949 and has long been scrapped." They were tricked! 8,300 yuan for a useless piece of junk. Li Kehui took a hard blow. Return it? Sue? Zhou Yu and Huang Gai, who can you blame? In the end, it's still our own fault for lacking culture and knowledge!

In the late 1950s, Li Kehui, who was not yet 20, also had the opportunity to study. He not only completed primary school but even attended an agricultural middle school. However, at that time, the Great Leap Forward came, and the farmers were creating high yields. Even in this valley, a "satellite" of 600,000 mu per acre was launched. The satellite was launched in the newspapers, but the farmers were starving to death. Li Kehui, who was not full, had no strength or mind to study. He dropped out of school. Decades passed, and he did not feel it was a pity. Now, with the reform and opening up, allowing farmers to get rich, Li Kehui finally felt the retribution.

Sitting in front of the huge piece of junk, he sat for hour after hour. Li Kehui felt for the first time in his life the true meaning of his incompetence and hopelessness, feeling that changing the fate of farmers could not be done with just calloused hands. In his despair, he struggled to think, and finally, like a flash of lightning, a sudden realization struck him: educate. He found the way out.

Li Kehui was not a government official, nor was he an education official. As a small village cadre, he had strange but effective local policies to implement his plan to educate. The first thing was to establish the status of knowledge and scholars in Dakang, to gradually shift from worshiping gods and land to worshiping knowledge and respecting scholars, making education as important and urgent as eating and wearing clothes.

Next to the junk punch press, Li Kehui convened a village cadre meeting. After a heavy narration and heated debate, four new village rules were born: 1. The village would cover all tuition fees for students below high school; 2. Students admitted to vocational or college would receive an annual subsidy of 200 to 300 yuan; 3. For every key middle school teacher cultivated for Dakang, a reward of 1,000 yuan would be given; 4. Village cadres who do not care about the education cause would be removed.

In 1978, 200 to 300 yuan was a considerable sum for urban cadres, and even more so for the poor village of Dakang. However, here they were willing to reward children who studied well. Knowledge and education turned out to be a very valuable thing, and the people of Dakang Village felt an indescribable taste. When the new village rules, signed by all cadres in red and gold, were posted on the old scholar's ginkgo tree, the villagers all turned their unusual gazes to their own children.

Li Kehui's education was not limited to this small piece of land in Dakang. Once he was hooked, it seemed that everything was related to him.

Chen Wenliang, the teacher in charge of primary schools in the township education group, was a responsible and good teacher. He had been a children's king in these mountain villages for over 30 years. Crossing mountains and valleys, spring, summer, autumn, and winter, he traveled from village to village for guidance. Now that he was getting older, his old bicycle was still not stopping. One day, he came to Dakang again, as usual, sweating profusely and panting, but he bumped into Li Kehui.

Later, Li Kehui found the village accountant and instructed, "Go to the county city and buy a Jialing motorcycle for Teacher Chen. The cost of the car and oil, Dakang will cover." The car was bought, and it was time to send it to Teacher Chen's home. Even if no one could ride it, there were tractors and horse-drawn carriages to transport it. However, Li Kehui, to show Dakang Village's sincerity and to make Teacher Chen unable to refuse, insisted on delivering it personally. Unable to ride, he could only push it. Over 30 li of mountain road, the heavy motorcycle was not easy to push. Bent over, one step at a time, one drop of sweat.

Teacher Chen's eyes were blurred with tears, holding Li Kehui's hand and not knowing what to say. After teaching for over 30 years, he had never been so valued, understood, and respected. "If Dakang Village does not produce university students, I will die with regret." Old Chen choked up, saying the same oath in both hearts.

The middle school students of Dakang Village studied in a joint middle school outside the village. The whip was long and could not be reached, and the good and bad could not be managed. However, he often heard the students' complaints, that the principal of the joint middle school was a good eater and drinker, not a good official. Li Kehui could not sit still and went to observe and investigate for himself, and it turned out to be true. Misleading the children! Li Kehui was furious and ran to the relevant departments, up and down, reflecting and appealing, causing a commotion for half a year or more, finally moving God, and the principal was replaced.

The primary school in the mountain village had been a single-class primary school for many years, never standardized. The teaching quality was poor, needless to say. Li Kehui heard that the township decided to merge the primary school classes of 7 villages into one key primary school, which was like a blessing from heaven. He rushed to the township government and begged, "Please build the school in our village. The construction funds, we will cover all, and we guarantee it will be first-class." The township agreed. All the villagers gathered under the old scholar's ginkgo tree, discussing the school construction funds. 110,000 yuan! This meant pouring out the family's savings for the village that had just begun to prosper. "Without education, the root of poverty will never be eradicated..." Li Kehui seemed to have a mysterious cohesive force and persuasive power in Dakang Village. He did not use hard orders or high tones, but a few sincere words, and the matter was done. To build the school, people were willing to share less dividends, willing to do voluntary labor...

The school was built, right next to the 400-year-old ginkgo tree. A few years later, Dakang Village became even richer and built a large-scale Dakang Kindergarten on the other side.

The primary school and kindergarten stood side by side with the 400-year-old ginkgo tree. If the old scholar knew, what would his feelings be?

In 1982, the ghostly old scholar finally rested in peace. The first university student of Dakang Village—a poor boy named Li Hongfeng—took big steps, crossed the old ginkgo tree, and walked along the winding mountain road to the distant ice city. One step back, he could not bear to leave the villagers who came to see him off. His father had passed away, and the family's situation was even more difficult. Li Hongfeng had once decided to drop out of middle school with tears in his eyes. It was the village cadres who sent the relief money in time. Before the college entrance examination, Li Kehui specially hired a tutor for him. No matter where he went in the future, he would not forget this favor. "Harbin Institute of Technology." Under the old scholar's ginkgo tree, Li Kehui murmured this slightly awkward school name and poured a cup of sacrificial wine. At night, almost every family in the village set up a banquet to celebrate this grand festival for the whole village.

Now, seven years have passed. Li Hongfeng had long graduated and was living in Beijing, becoming a national expert. When we returned to Dakang, Li Kehui already had a "running account" in his hand. He would open it and tell you, as if reciting a familiar story, about which year, which family's child, went to which city and which school.

We counted, and by this year, the small village of Dakang had sent 30 children to colleges and universities. There were students from Dakang in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenyang, and Wuhan. This year, a girl participated in the college entrance examination. Later, to inquire about the results, whether the first choice was admitted or the second choice, the only imported car in Dakang Village ran to Yantai 5 times. The last time, there was a car accident, and it cost 5,400 yuan to barely repair it. The middle school students in Beijing, apart from their parents, who else would spend this much effort for their admission? Look at the students who went away, apart from the annual fixed subsidy, during the winter and summer vacations, the travel expenses were sent to the school with the hometown's greetings. Their parents in the village enjoyed the treatment of military dependents: someone helped to farm the responsibility fields, someone delivered firewood regularly, and cadres came to ask after their health during the holidays...

Li Kehui's feelings for scholars sometimes reached the level of "madness."

About a li away from Dakang, there was a small village called "Houdi," where a man studying earthquake engineering at Peking University was from. It was said that he was very successful. Li Kehui did not know him, but for some reason, he always remembered him, as if he had something to say to him. Just as the young man's sister was married in Dakang, Li Kehui went to visit and said, "When your brother comes home for vacation, tell him, I want to see him." The university student was on vacation and heard his sister mention this. Li Kehui's education efforts were already known to everyone in the area. As soon as his sister mentioned it, the young man's heart was filled with a strange feeling, both admiration and closeness, a spiritual and soulful connection. Before Li Kehui could come to the door, he followed his sister to Dakang. Seating, pouring tea, the old and young, the farmer and the elite of the highest institute of learning in China, sat opposite each other and talked freely, meeting late.

"Look at you, you really appreciate him. Earthquakes, what use do we have for earthquakes?" The guest left, and Li Kehui's wife, while tidying up the tea, muttered, "You don't know anything. Studying earthquakes is very useful. If it can be predicted, it can save many lives and national property." "Earthquakes are far away from us. Besides, he is not our village's child." "Hey," Li Kehui smiled tolerantly at his wife, "Our Dakang students study all kinds of things outside, and even if they don't come back to Dakang after graduation, they are still our country's people."

Indeed. Not only Li Kehui's wife, but even we felt that Li Kehui was at a loss. He spent so much effort cultivating university students, and they all flew away.

"Our village produces 50 university students, and 50 families will be good. Our village produces 100 university students, and 100 families will be good!"

We could not help but be surprised again. Li Kehui was too good at using the simplest language to shake people's thoughts and emotions. Thinking carefully about his short sentence, it seemed to contain enough content to write a thesis. Knowledge, a person's quality and level of civilization, the quality and level of civilization of a family, a collective, a society, and a nation, and the profound interconnection between them, were all simply expressed by Li Kehui. He spoke in such a distinctive way, so convincing.

The young man from Houdi Village did not let Li Kehui down. Now, he has obtained a doctorate in Australia and is continuing his post-doctoral studies. Even in the distant foreign country, he did not forget Li Kehui, this friend, and specially sent him a color photo in his doctoral gown. Opening the box, Li Kehui took out the carefully preserved photo and gently stroked it with his calloused hands, even though there was no dust on it. Looking at his cherished expression, it was as if the photo was his own son, at least it was a child of Dakang that they had personally cultivated and sent away. In his eyes, there was not only love and joy but also a deep longing from the heart.

"Sigh, our village can't be good in my hands. But 30 years later, you come and see."

When we parted, Li Kehui seriously said to us. This sentence made me unable to calm down on the way back. Li Kehui's education was not for fame or reputation, not to make the villagers of Dakang, or the Dakang children who had gone to university and had a future, grateful, not to make future generations remember his story like they remember the old scholar, and certainly not to make the future masters of Dakang and even Chinese villages inherit his or the old era's legacy. Li Kehui did all this because history had denied himself, denied the choices of the old generation of farmers. His yearning for knowledge, his emphasis on and investment in education, his sincere respect and love for young university students, all came from the depths of his soul.

This is a farmer's pursuit and dream of civilization.

　　银杏树下
　　——一个庄稼汉的追求与梦想
    谢致红
　　1
    是一条寻常的山路。
    汽车不疾不徐地朝山里走着，车轮仍旧向后甩起大团大团的烟雾，将赶车、挑担、背筐的庄稼人一股脑淹进去，倒像是在演练什么奇门遁术。一条黑狗猛然窜上公路，昂头挑战般地拦住车头。司机在急促的喇叭声中踩了刹车，黑狗却一声不吭地和我们对峙片刻，一跃奔下路基，将我们的视线引向刚刚收割过的原野。原野是美丽古老的，生生息息养育过多少流星般倏忽仓猝的生命。秋天她还微微蒸腾着热气，只要熬过贫瘠凋敝的寒冬，又会献上她青春的胴体。2
    大亢村，山路旁一个寻常的北方小山村。迎出来的是村支部书记李克会。我是慕名来看他的。
    打量着眼前的中年汉子，全然不是我想像的样子。顺道在胶东跑了一圈，结识了不少财大气粗、身材魁伟、声如洪钟、能言善饮的农民企业家，乍见李克会，便觉质朴憨厚有余，精明强干不足，有点自卑。纵横沟壑的绉纹，微驼的背，向下望的眼睛，迟缓略显滞拙的脚步，中气不足而喑哑的嗓音……没大精气神，寻常的庄稼汉子。3
    全村最高级的建筑耸立在我们眼前，一幢造价30万元的二层楼房。造价30万，与北京任何一所大饭店相比只能算是贫民窟，但在山洼洼里，祖祖辈辈住草房石屋的大亢村，它确是鹤立鸡群了。
    不是暴发户的门楼，不是村办企业的新厂房，不是干部的办公室，它是一座幼儿园。只有200来户人家的小山村里的幼儿园。
    走进孩子的天地，脚下也不由得轻了。空气中似乎荡漾着一股令人心颤的宁静。妈妈好辛苦，快快请坐下。擦擦汗，喝杯茶，我把扇子给你摇……稚嫩，不很整齐的歌声跳荡着，孩子们正在上课。从教室门上的玻璃望进去，一位年轻的女教师正埋头专心地弹奏着风琴。一曲终了，我们推门进去，顿时被十几双乌溜溜的眼睛牢牢看住。年轻的教师，一个乡村少女，脸红得好像她身上的红毛衣，却没忘记告诉孩子们说：“叔叔阿姨好。”教室的后墙，另有一扇小门通往宿舍，里面排列着淡蓝色的小木床，农家喜爱的大花被褥，色彩浓艳，沐浴在和暖的阳光中。
    一间间教室看过，李克会领我们到了锅炉房，据说造这个锅炉房花了整整8万元，是用来为孩子们烧暖气和洗澡的。锅炉房尚未使用，站在它银灰色的身躯下，我记起了另一些我熟悉的农家孩子。在我插队的地方，孩子们夏天光着腚，冬天空心穿着棉袄棉裤，从早到晚在房前屋后摸爬滚打。渴了喝口井水，饿了啃块地瓜，他们手背、脚腕、脖颈永远是黑皴皴的，衣服上老是沾满污泥……他们的大脑里几乎是空白的，一切属于知识和文明的美好事物都离他们非常遥远……
    “让俺这村的孩子从小知道洗澡，养成文明卫生的习惯，一茬两茬，这村里的人就不一样。”李克会慢腾腾地说。
    我惊讶这思想的朴实简单，更惊讶这朴实简单中所具有的征服魅力。洗澡，文明世界里一种
  小小的卫生习惯而已。对大多数城里人来说，定
  期洗澡是一件自然而然的事，谁还会发现它是个
  文明的象征，是一个山村农民向往文明的窗口？4
    大亢村在地理上是个相当闭塞的地方。说起来顺着山路往外，不过40来里路就是胶东的名城之一黄县（如今改叫龙口市），再过去就是一望无际的大海。往东，也不过乘两个来小时的汽车，就是美丽的海滨城市烟台。然而，起伏的山梁，偏偏把大亢锁在了瘠薄、狭窄、寡闻、沉闷的山谷深处。
    日出而作，日入而息。大亢人一代又一代满足地生活在自给自足的小农经济中。满足于仅有一个初小班，使孩子们能写简单的家信和算一点小帐。似乎很少会出现一个不安分的家伙，做做超越现实的“白日梦”，或者把大亢的命运与并不遥远的大海、平原、城市联结起来。他们念念不忘，代代相传的倒是一个传说，一个古人的梦想。
    大约400年前，一个落第的秀才，顺着山路流落到这里，在一小块平地上栽了两棵银杏树。躺在树下，秀才梦见自己中了状元，醒来才知乃是一枕黄粱。不知从什么时候起，大亢人相信这是一种神奇的“托梦”，大亢村总有一天会圆了这个状元梦。400年一晃而去。两根银杏团团如盖，果实万千，大亢莫说状元，连个正经八百念书的人也没出来一个。梦终归是梦，农家的日子可是越来越穷。5
    1978年的春天，通往大亢的山路上洒满了香甜芬芳。雪白的梨花一团团一簇簇在春风中摇荡。大亢村的汉子们老棉袄敞开了怀，头上冒着丝丝热气，正艰难缓慢地把一个庞然大物运上山去。
    好大一台冲床，乌溜溜的。在烟台那家工厂里第一眼看见它，李克会便被镇住了。惊叹之态被卖主看进眼里，不失时机地说；“别人给一万，我们还不卖哩。8300你们拿去。便宜，支援农民兄弟致富嘛。”几句甜言蜜语本不致迷住精打细算了大半辈子的李克会，但这机器实在太大了，“卖铁也值了，人家还能坑俺？”李克会认定了，一咬牙，掏出那一叠大团结。
    机器是大亢的了。它将是全村人致富的一枚钥匙。大亢村要办选矿厂，第一宝就押在它身上。反复试车后，大亢人热烈兴奋的心情冷淡了，这大家伙不听使唤。请懂行人来看过，人家摇摇头说：这是1949年制造的，早就报废了。让人耍了！8300元买了个中看不中用的家伙，真正的一堆废铁。李克会这一闷棍挨得不轻。退货？告状？周瑜打黄盖，怨得了谁呢？说到底，还得怨咱自己没文化没见识！
    50年代末，不到20岁的李克会也曾有过念书的机会。不仅念过小学，甚至还上了农中。可偏巧那会来了大跃进，让庄稼人创高产，这山洼洼里竟也放出了亩产60万的大卫星。卫星在报纸上放着，庄稼人可就有饿死的了。吃不饱的李克会，哪来的力气和心思念书？退学了事。一晃几十年，他倒也没觉着咋可惜，如今改革开放，允许农民致富了，李克会这才体会到报应的滋味儿。
    守着庞然的废物，坐了一个时辰又一个时辰。李克会有生以来头一次真正觉出了自己的无能与无望，感到了改变庄稼人的命运并不能只靠长满老茧的大手。在沮丧中他苦苦思索，终于，犹如电光石火，当头棒喝，他找到了出路：办教育。6
    李克会不是一级政府，也不是教育部门，做为一个小小的村干部，他自有奇怪却颇有成效的土政策来实现办教育的计划。第一件事，就是在大亢树立知识和读书人的地位，让乡亲们从信奉神佛崇拜土地渐渐转向信奉知识，尊重读书人，使教育具有同吃饭、穿衣同等重要迫切的意义。
    在大废物冲床旁，李克会召集了村干部会。经过沉重的述说和热烈的争论之后，4条新的村规诞生了：1、高中以下学生，全部学费由村里承担；2、考上中专或大专的学生，每年补助二三百元钱；3、为大亢每培养一个重点中学学生的教师奖励1000元；4、村干部不关心教育事业者，罢免。
    1978年的时候，二三百元钱对城里的干部也是颇大的一笔财富，在贫穷的大亢村更是令人眼晕，而这里却舍得奖励书读得好的孩子。知识和教育竟是个极有价值的玩艺，大亢村的人体会了说不出的味道。当红纸金字，全体干部郑重签名的新村规被贴在老秀才的银杏树上时，村里的人都把不寻常的眼光放在了自家孩子身上。7
    李克会办教育，眼睛可不只盯在大亢这巴掌地上。一旦迷上了，便好像哪里都和自己沾着边。
    乡教育组负责小学的陈文亮老师，是个负责任的好老师，在这一带的山乡当了30余年的孩子王。翻山越岭，春夏秋冬，一村又一村的巡回辅导。如今年纪渐渐大了，那辆破烂自行车却还不曾停下。那一日，他又到了大亢，照例是热汗淋漓，气喘吁吁，却迎面碰上了李克会。
    事后，李克会找到村会计，吩咐说：“你去县城一趟，给陈老师买辆嘉陵摩托车。车钱，油钱，咱们大亢出。”车买来了，该给陈老师送家去。就算没人能骑，还有拖拉机、大马车运嘛。可是李克会为了表示大亢村的诚心，为了让陈老师无法拒绝，他一定要亲自送去。不会骑，只有推着。30多里山路，沉甸甸的摩托车不是好推的。躬腰拱背，一步一个脚印，一滴汗水。
    陈老师泪眼朦胧，攥着李克会的手不知该说什么。从教30余年，他还从未得到过这样的看重，这样的理解，这样的尊敬。“大亢村要出不来大学生，咱死不瞑目。”陈老哽咽着，说出了两个心里的同一个誓言。
    大亢村的中学生，是在外乡念联中的。鞭长莫及，不在自家地盘上，好坏管不了。可是，他不断地听到学生们的诉说，联中的校长是个好吃好喝，不务正业的人。李克会沉不住气了，亲自跑去观察了解了一番，竟是真的。误人子弟啊。李克会急了眼，一趟趟往有关部门跑，上上下下，又是反映又是呼吁，折腾了半年多，总算感动了上帝，校长换了人。
    山村小学，多少年来就是一村一个小学班，从未正规过。教学质量差是不必说的。李克会听说乡里决定把7个村的小学班合在一起，办一所重点小学，真如喜从天降。他跑到乡政府，苦苦地恳求：“把学校办在俺村吧。建校的钱，我们全包了，保证是第一流的。”乡里同意了。全村的乡亲们聚在了老秀才的银杏树下，商量着建校的费用。11万元啊，这对刚刚开始富裕的大亢村来说意味着泼上家底。“不办教育，穷根子永远也挖不掉……”李克会这个人，在大亢村似乎有种神秘的凝聚力与号召力。他办事不用硬命令也不唱高调，实实在在几句话，事就办了。为了盖学校，人们愿意少分红，愿意出义务工……
    学校起来了，就盖在老秀才的银杏树下。又过几年，大亢村更富裕了，又在另一边盖起了颇具规模的大亢幼儿园。
    小学校，幼儿园，与400年的银杏树并肩而立，老秀才若泉下有知，又该是何样心情？8
    1982年，幽灵不去的老秀才终于可以安静了。大亢村的第一个大学生——一个叫李鸿峰的穷苦孩子迈着大步，跨过老银杏树，沿着弯曲的山路去了，走向遥远的冰城。一步一回头，舍不下送行的乡亲。父亲去世了，家境越加困难，读中学的李鸿峰曾含泪忍痛下了退学的决心。是村干部及时送来了救济金。考大学之前，李克会为他，专请了辅导老师。往后走到天南地北，也忘不掉这份情。“哈尔滨工业大学。”老秀才的银杏树下，李克会喃喃叨念着这有几分拗口的校名，将一杯祭奠的老酒洒了下去。入夜，村里几乎家家摆酒，庆贺这全村人的盛大节日。
    如今，又是七度寒暑。李鸿峰早已学成毕业，生活在北京，成了国家的专门人才。我们再来到大亢，李克会的手中已经有了一本“流水帐”，他会翻开来，如数家珍地告诉你从那以后，又有哪一年，谁家的孩子，考进了哪个城市的哪所学校。
    我们数了数，到今年为止，小小的大亢村考上大中专的孩子已经整整30个。北京、广州、沈阳、武汉都有大亢的子弟在读书。今年有个女孩子参加了高考，后来为了打听成绩，第一志愿录取还是第二志愿，大亢村唯一的一台进口车上烟台就跑了5趟。最后一次出点车祸，花了5400元钱才勉强算修上了。北京城里的中学生们，除了自家的父母，哪还会有人为他们的升学尽这份苦心？再看看考走的学生，村里除了每年固定的补贴外，一到寒暑假，路费便带着家乡的呼唤寄到学校。他们的父母在村里享受着烈军属的待遇：责任田有人帮忙种，柴草有人定期送，年节有干部来嘘寒问暖……9
    李克会对读书人的那份情感，有时真到了“痴”的程度。
    离大亢一里来地，有个叫“后地”的小村子，出了一个在北大学地震专业的人。据说很有出息。李克会不认识他，可不知为什么，心里头却老是惦记着他，好像有话要对他说似的。正好，小伙子有个姐姐嫁在大亢，李克会就找上门去跟人家说：“等你兄弟放假来家，你说一声，我想去看看他。”大学生放假了，听姐姐说起此事。李克会办教育在当地早已人人皆知，姐姐一提起，小伙子心里顿时有了一种奇怪的情感，又钦佩又亲近，那是一种精神上心灵上的相通。不等李克会上门，他随着姐姐找到大亢来了。让座，沏茶，一老一少，庄稼汉和中国最高学府的高材生相对娓娓而谈，相见恨晚。
      “看你，是真稀罕他。地震，地震对咱有啥用？”客走了，李克会的妻子一边收拾残茶一边说叨。“你知道啥？学地震可有大用。这要是能预报了，救下多少人的性命多少国家财产。”“地震离咱远着呢。再说，他又不是咱村的娃娃。”“嗨”，李克会对妻子宽容地一笑，“咱大亢的学生在外面学啥的都有，毕业了也不回咱大亢，可还是咱国家的人。”
    真的。别说李克会的妻子，连我们也觉得李克会亏得慌。费老劲培养大学生，一个个还不都远走高飞了。
      “俺村出50个大学生就好了50家，出100个大学生，就好了100家！”
    我们不得不又一次惊异，李克会是太善于用最简单的语言来摇撼人的思想和情感了。细琢磨他那短短的一句话，里面所涵盖的内容却似乎够写一篇论文了。知识，一个人的素质和文明程度，一个家庭、一个集体、一个社会、一个民族的素质和文明程度乃至其中深刻的相互联系，让李克会简单地道出了。说得那么富有特色，那么令人口服心服。10
    后地村的小伙子没让李克会看错。如今，他已在澳大利亚获得了博士学位，正在继续做博士后。即使在遥远的异国，他也并没有忘记李克会这个朋友，特意给他寄来了穿着博士服的彩色照片。打开箱笼上的锁，李克会取出了仔细保存的照片，用那双满是老茧的大手轻轻摩挲着，尽管上面没有任何灰尘。看他那珍爱的模样，仿佛照片上就是他自己的儿子，至少是他们大亢亲自培养送出去的子弟。那眼神里不仅充满了慈爱、喜悦，还有一份发自内心的向往。
      “唉，俺村在俺手里是搞不好的了。但30年以后，你再来瞧瞧。”
    送别的时候，李克会认真地对我们说。这句话使我在归程上久久无法平静。李克会办教育，并不是为了沽名钓誉，不是为了让大亢村的村民，让考上大学有了前程的大亢子弟们感激，不是为了让后代子孙像纪念老秀才那样把他的故事传下去，更不是为了让大亢乃至中国农村未来的主人继承他自己的或旧时代的衣钵。李克会做这一切，是因为历史地否定了自己，否定了老一代农民之后的抉择。他对知识的向往，对教育的重视与投入，对年轻的大学生的看重和爱护，真诚地发自于心灵深处。
    这就是一个庄稼汉关于文明的追求与梦想。
