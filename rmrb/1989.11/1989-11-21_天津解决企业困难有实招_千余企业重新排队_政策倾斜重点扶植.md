Tianjin Municipal Government has implemented practical measures to encourage the industrial sector to face challenges head-on and boost production, in line with the spirit of the Fifth Plenum.

Recently, the Tianjin Municipal Government convened a meeting with representatives from some large and medium-sized enterprises to discuss the difficulties facing industrial production and strategies for turning the situation around. The municipal government announced that it would reclassify and prioritize 1,400 enterprises. Those with good domestic and international sales, key enterprises that play a crucial role in the city's production, leading enterprises, and their supporting enterprises will receive priority support. Enterprises with products that have some market demand and can ensure sales will also receive some support. However, this classification is not permanent; enterprises that do not show improvement after receiving support will no longer be eligible for preferential policies.

The Municipal Party Committee and Government have also decided to ensure that leaders have more time to focus on the grassroots level, paying more attention to industrial production.

　　天津解决企业困难有实招
　　千余企业重新排队
　　政策倾斜重点扶植
    本报天津11月20日电　记者肖荻报道：天津市政府贯彻五中全会精神，想出实招鼓励工业系统迎难而上，发展生产。
    近日，天津市政府召集部分大中型企业厂长、经理共议工业生产面临的困难局面及扭转对策。市政府宣布对1400个企业重新分类排队，对国内外产销形势好的企业、对全市生产形势起关键作用的龙头厂、排头厂以及与其配套的企业，将予以重点扶植。对产品有一定销路、基本保证尽产尽销的，也要予以一定扶植。但这一分类不搞“终身制”，经扶植不见起色的企业，不再给予倾斜政策。
    市委、市政府还决定保证领导有更多精力深入基层，对工业生产给予更多关注。
