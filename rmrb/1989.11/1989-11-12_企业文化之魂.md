Only people are the most active and primary productive force within an enterprise. In the 1980s, the theme of foreign enterprise management shifted from operational strategy to corporate culture, which is the management of people. The American magazine "Success" pointed out: "Without a strong corporate culture, that is, values and philosophical beliefs, even the most brilliant operational strategies cannot succeed. Corporate culture is the foundation of an enterprise's survival, the driving force behind its development, the standard for its behavior, and the core of its success." Many enlightened individuals in the Western economic sphere have long recognized this and successfully applied it to the management of modern enterprises.

Which is more important, bonuses or spirit? Bonuses are necessary, but once they become part of household expenses, they are forgotten. Only a spiritual pillar is the main source of strength. Cultivating corporate culture requires repeated propaganda and "ideological indoctrination" among employees to inspire their initiative. The American Mary Kay Cosmetics Company grew from an initial nine people to become the world's largest cosmetics company with annual sales of $300 million. One of the main reasons for its success is its emphasis on cultivating corporate culture. Mary Kay believes: "A manager must instill a sense of pride in his people, regardless of the work they do. Businessmen, assembly line workers, salespeople, file clerks, and managers should all be proud of their work and feel proud of what they do." She believes this first comes from a sense of national pride. Someone who does not love his own country cannot be proud of his work. Mary Kay has given hundreds of speeches filled with patriotic passion to the company's employees and waved the national flag at company gatherings. She believes that even if such speeches are given every day, it would not be too much.

First-class companies must have first-class talent. Enterprises do not need yes-men who follow the rules, but rather people with unique creativity. The son of the founder of the American International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Thomas Watson Jr., likened such people to "wild ducks." He said, "We firmly believe that enterprises need 'wild ducks,' and at IBM, we will not try to tame them." Yes, a tamed "wild duck" will forever lose its wild nature and will no longer have creativity. Cultivating and respecting talent, and fully utilizing their potential, is the core of corporate culture. An enterprise's respect for its employees will inevitably make the employees more self-respecting. This high level of trust in employees will turn into a tremendous material force. The American Hewlett-Packard computer company implements an "open laboratory warehouse policy," allowing engineers to freely enter the warehouse and take items, even bringing them home for personal use. The company believes that when employees come into contact with these items in their lives, they will generate innovative inspiration and a sense of reform, which will directly or indirectly create wealth for the company.

In the face of the era of intense competition, only by making all employees have a sense of shared honor and disgrace, a "collective block" consciousness, and a "team spirit," can an enterprise survive and thrive. Corporate culture is to enhance this cohesion of the enterprise. This cohesion, with "unity" and "cooperation" as its main themes, can partially replace administrative orders. In the early 1950s, Honda Motor Company was in a dire state, but President Soichiro Honda was determined to win the "Motorcycle Grand Prix." He believed that "winning the Grand Prix would make the product dominate the world." The president led the way, working hard for five years, and with the "superhuman management" of the "Honda Spirit," he finally succeeded. Honda motorcycles won the New York Motorcycle Grand Prix on their first attempt. Two years later, they participated in all 11 world championships, defeating all competitors, and thus became the dominant force in the world motorcycle market.

In modern enterprise management, there are three famous sayings: "A person's knowledge is not as good as a person's intelligence," "A person's intelligence is not as good as a person's character," and "A person's character is not as good as a person's awareness." Therefore, it is not surprising that some people regard raising the awareness of people within the enterprise as the "soul of corporate culture."

    企业文化之魂
    李亨
    只有人才是企业中最活跃、最主要的生产力。80年代国外企业管理的主题已由经营战略转向企业文化，即对人的管理。美国《幸福》杂志指出：“没有强大的企业文化，即价值观和哲学信仰，再高明的经营战略也无法成功。企业文化是企业生存的基础，发展的动力，行为的准则，成功的核心。”西方经济界的许多有识之士早已清醒地认识到这一点，并成功地应用到现代企业的管理之中。
    奖金和精神哪一个更重要？奖金是必要的，然而一旦变成家庭开支中一部分时就被忘却了。唯有精神支柱才是力量的主要源泉。培养企业文化就必须在职工中反复进行宣传和“思想灌输”，以此来激发人们的进取心。美国玛丽·凯化妆品公司由最初的9个人发展成为世界上最大的、年销售额达3亿美元的化妆品公司，其成功之道的一个主要原因就是重视培养企业文化。玛丽·凯认为：“一个经理必须使自己的人员有自豪感，不管他们干哪种工作。商人、装配线上的工人、推销员、档案管理员以及经理人员都要有自豪感，都要为自己的工作而感到自豪。”她认为这首先来自对于祖国的自豪感，一个不爱自己国家的人是不可能对自己的工作感到自豪的。玛丽·凯向公司职工发表过数百次充满爱国激情的演说，在公司集会上挥舞国旗，她认为即使天天发表这样的讲话似乎也不过分。
    第一流的公司必须具有第一流的人才。企业需要的不是唯唯诺诺、循规蹈矩的人，而是需要有独特创造力的人。美国国际商用机器公司（IBM）创始人之子小托马斯·华生把这种人比喻为
  “野鸭”，他说：“我们坚信，企业需要‘野鸭’，在IBM我们不会试图去驯化他们。”是的，驯化了的“野鸭”永远失去了他的野性，再也不会有创造力了。培养和尊重人才，充分发挥他们的作用，这正是企业文化的核心。企业对职工的尊重，必然会使职工更加自尊，这种对职工的高度信任会变成巨大的物质力量。美国惠普电脑公司实行“实验室库房开架政策”，工程师们可以自由出入库房取物，甚至可拿回家中供个人使用。公司认为职工在生活中随时接触这些物件时，就会产生创新的灵感、改革的意识，这将会直接或间接地为公司创造财富。
    面临超竞争时代的企业，只有使全体职工具有荣辱与共的信念、“集体板块”意识、“集团军”的精神，才能使企业生存和繁荣。企业文化就是要增强这种企业的凝聚力。这种凝聚力是以“团结”、“协作”为其主旋律的，它可以部分地代替行政命令。50年代初的日本本田技研社正处于惨淡经营的时期，但社长本田宗一郎立志一定要拿下“摩托车大奖赛的头奖”，他坚信“胜了大奖赛，产品就能称霸全世界”。社长带头苦干5年，以“超能力经营”的“本田精神”终于获得成功。本田摩托车首次参加纽约摩托车大奖赛即一举夺魁。两年后又参加了世界上全部11项大奖赛，力挫群雄，从此登上了世界摩托车市场的霸主地位。
    现代企业管理界有三句名言：“人的知识不如人的智力”，“人的智力不如人的素质”，“人的素质不如人的觉悟”。因此，有人把提高企业内部人的觉悟视为“企业文化之魂”，也就不足为怪了。
