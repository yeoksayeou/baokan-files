Iranian security personnel recently busted a drug smuggling ring in Iran's northeastern province of Khorasan, killing one person, arresting two, and seizing 63 kilograms of opium.

The broadcast said that this crackdown occurred in an area near the Afghan border, which is a major route for drug traffickers smuggling drugs from Afghanistan into Iran.

Since Iran enacted a strict anti-drug law in January this year, authorities have conducted multiple similar crackdowns in border areas adjacent to Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Iran's anti-drug law stipulates that anyone found in possession of even a small amount of drugs will be sentenced to death. According to Iranian newspapers, approximately 1,000 drug criminals have been executed by hanging in the past 10 months.

According to official statistics from Iran, among its 50 million population, 1 million people are drug users. However, unofficial statistics suggest that the actual number of drug users is 2 million.

    伊朗采取行动打击贩毒团伙
    新华社德黑兰电　据德黑兰电台广播说，伊朗保安人员最近在伊朗东北部的呼罗珊省破获了一个毒品走私团伙，击毙一人，抓获二人，缴获鸦片63公斤。
    广播说，这次打击活动发生在伊朗接近阿富汗边境的地区，那里是毒品贩子从阿富汗向伊朗走私毒品的主要通道。
    自今年1月伊朗颁布严厉的禁毒法以来，在伊朗同阿富汗和巴基斯坦接壤的边境地区，当局进行了多次类似的打击活动。
    伊朗的这项禁毒法规定，任何被发现拥有哪怕很少量毒品的人都将被处以死刑。据伊朗报纸报道，在过去10个月里大约已有1000名毒品犯罪分子被处绞刑。
    据伊朗官方统计，在伊朗5000万人口中，有100万人吸毒。但非官方的统计说，实际上吸毒者有200万。
