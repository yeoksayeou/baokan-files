	To the Editor:

	In 1987, I was deceived by someone into giving him 1,000 yuan in cash. Despite repeated attempts to retrieve the money, several hundred yuan remain unpaid. I then sued him in the local court. The court, based on the facts, ruled that the defendant must pay the outstanding 500 yuan by May 6, 1989, and pay the court fees of 30 yuan in advance. Several months have passed, but the defendant has not paid the money. What should I do if the judgment cannot be enforced?

	Li Quanfa:

	The judgments of the people's courts, whether criminal or civil, are expressions of the will of the people's courts exercising the judicial power of the state and represent the will of the state. Once made, they cannot be changed except through legal procedures. The judgment, ruling, and mediation agreement of the people's courts, once they take legal effect, must be complied with by the parties involved.

	You mentioned that you have a debt dispute with someone, and after the people's court ruled on it, several months have passed, and it has not been fully executed. If you want it to be fully executed, you can apply to the people's court for enforcement according to Article 166 of the Civil Procedure Law (Trial).

	The enforcement procedure, also known as the compulsory enforcement procedure, refers to the procedure by which the people's court, upon the application of one party or ex officio, compels the party with the obligation to perform the obligation when the party with the obligation refuses to perform the obligation determined by the legal document.

	Enforcement is based on the judgment, ruling, and mediation agreement made by the people's court, as well as the award of the arbitration institution, the debt document with compulsory enforcement power granted by the notary office, and the administrative decision of the administrative organ; the enforcement basis must have a performance content, that is, the above-mentioned enforcement basis is to determine that the obligor performs a certain act of delivering property to the other party; the enforcement basis must have taken legal effect; the enforcement must be the party with the obligation refusing to perform the obligation confirmed by the legal document. The people's court enforces the compulsory enforcement measures according to law, using the coercive power of the state to ensure that the rights and obligations confirmed by the legal documents that have taken legal effect are realized. In judicial practice, the vast majority of parties can perform the rights and obligations confirmed by the people's court according to law. Only a small number of parties refuse to perform their obligations, and the situations and reasons are different. Some parties may have actual difficulties and no ability to perform; some may have a weak sense of legal system and refuse to perform; some may refuse to perform because they are not satisfied with the court's judgment. In this regard, the people's court should analyze the reasons for the refusal to perform obligations by the party applying for enforcement before enforcement, conduct legal system propaganda and education according to different situations, and do a good job of ideological education, explaining the consequences of refusing to perform the legal documents that have taken legal effect, and urging them to perform voluntarily. If the party applying for enforcement is deliberately causing trouble and refuses to perform the legal documents that have taken legal effect, the people's court should take measures to compel the party being enforced to perform the obligation. If the party being enforced has temporary difficulties and is unable to perform, after doing the work, reach an enforcement agreement, and strive to perform as soon as possible.

	Enforcement is a serious matter. The enforcement measures are very strict, such as detaining or withdrawing the savings deposits or labor income of the party being enforced; sealing up, detaining, freezing, or selling the property of the party being enforced; forcibly moving out of the house or forcibly vacating the land, etc. Therefore, the adoption of compulsory enforcement measures must be done according to law and cannot be done simply. The applicant for enforcement should also be reasonable to facilitate the smooth progress of the enforcement work.

     判决书不能生效怎么办？编辑同志：
    1987年，我被一人骗去现金1000元，后经多方索要，仍有数百元难于要回，于是我将他起诉本镇法庭。法庭依据事实，判决被告1989年5月6日一次交清所欠款500元，并提前交付败诉费30元。时过几个月，被告仍没有给我钱。请问：判决书不能生效，我该怎么办？
            湖北新洲县李集镇　李全发李全发同志：人民法院的判决，不论是刑事判决，还是民事判决，都是行使国家审判权的人民法院的意思表示，是国家意志的体现，一经作出，非依法定程序不得改变。人民法院的判决书、裁定书和调解协议，在发生法律效力后，当事人必须依法履行。
    你谈到你与他人的债权纠纷，经人民法院判决后至今几个月不能完全履行，你如果要求完全履行，可以根据民事诉讼法（试行）第166条规定，向人民法院申请执行。
    执行程序，又称强制执行程序。这是指负有义务的一方当事人拒绝履行法律文书确定的义务，人民法院根据另一方当事人的申请或者依职权，强制履行义务所适用的程序。
    执行是有根据的，即人民法院制作的判决书、裁定书和调解协议，也包括仲裁机关的裁决、公证机关赋予强制执行效力的债权文书和行政机关的行政决定；执行根据必须具有给付内容，即执行的上述根据是确定义务人给付对方某种财物的行为；执行根据必须是已经发生法律效力的；执行必须是负有义务的一方当事人拒绝履行法律文书确认的义务。人民法院依法采取强制执行措施，是运用国家的强制力，保证发生法律效力的法律文书所确认的权利义务得以实现。从审判实践看，绝大多数当事人，能够依法履行人民法院确认的权利和义务，拒绝履行义务的只是极少数，而且情况不同，原因各异。有的当事人可能存在实际困难，没有执行能力；有的可能是法制观念淡薄，而拒绝履行；也有的可能是因法院判决不当，当事人不服而拒绝履行。对此，人民法院在执行前，应当分析被申请执行人拒不履行义务的原因，根据不同情况，进行法制宣传教育，深入细致地做好思想教育工作，讲明拒不履行生效法律文书的后果，促使其自觉履行。如果被申请执行人确系故意无理取闹，拒不履行生效的法律文书，人民法院即应采取措施，强制被执行人履行义务。如果被执行人暂时存在困难无能力履行，经做工作后，达成执行协议，力争尽快履行。
    执行是一项严肃的工作。执行措施是很严厉的，如扣留、提取被执行人的储蓄存款或者劳动收入；查封、扣押、冻结、变卖被执行人的财产；强制迁出房屋或者强制退出土地等等。因此，采取强制执行措施，必须依法办事，不能简单从事。申请执行人也要通情达理，以使执行工作顺利进行。
