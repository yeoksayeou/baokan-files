Corruption manifests differently in various environments, but its occurrence is related to the quality and consciousness of the individuals involved. In the context of reform and opening up, those who engage in corrupt behavior often have the following psychological factors:

Misunderstanding of "power." Some cadres who receive salaries see individuals and entrepreneurs getting rich and, to achieve psychological and material balance, resort to unscrupulous means to make money, regardless of whether it is legal or not, as long as you give gifts, they will handle the matter.

Comparative psychology. Some cadres see others using their power for personal gain and engaging in power-for-money exchanges, and they follow suit, rationalizing it by thinking, "If he can do it, why can't I?"

Loss of psychological restraint. Some people start by accepting small "benefits," and then move on to accepting larger ones. As a result, their greed grows.

Psychology of accepting the status quo. For the benefit of oneself or one's unit, one has to compromise and accept the situation, as long as the matter can be resolved, giving money or gifts is of no consequence.

It seems that to eradicate corruption, we must focus on eliminating the psychological factors that lead to corruption, improve the quality of leading cadres, and strengthen the awareness of anti-corruption and integrity.

### 提高干部素质

　　提高干部素质
    腐败现象虽然在各种环境中表现不同，但它的发生与当事人的素质和意识有关。在改革开放的环境中，那些有腐败行为的人从心理上讲，有以下几个因素：
    对“权”的误解。有些拿工资的干部，看到一些个体户和企业家富起来，自己为了取得心理及物质上的平衡，不择手段地捞钱，不管违法不违法，只要你送礼，他就给办事。
    攀比心理。有些干部见到有的人以权谋私，权钱交易，也就进行效仿，心理还自慰道：“他能这样，为何我不能？”
    心理约束力的丧失。有些人开始接受小的“好处”，往后接受大的“好处”。结果贪欲越来越大。
    屈于现状的心理。为了本人或本单位的利益，自己或单位只好委屈求全，只要事能办成，送些钱，送些礼，无所谓。
    看来，要根治腐败现象，还应注重消除产生腐败现象的心理因素，提高领导干部的素质，增强防腐败、讲廉洁的意识。
