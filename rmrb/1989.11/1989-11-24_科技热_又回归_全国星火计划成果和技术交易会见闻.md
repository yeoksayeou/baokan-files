The crowd at the Zhejiang Exhibition Hall by West Lake is bustling. Many Hangzhou residents are puzzled: why are so many items "stuck" on the walls? Row after row of technical introductions filled with numbers and text that laypeople can't understand are so attractive?

This is an exhibition showcasing 3,000 items of Star Program technologies, applicable technologies, and technological products. From high-tech in electronics and biotechnology to the application technology of daily consumer goods, it covers a wide range. What the organizers did not expect was that every evening, the number of transaction contracts submitted for certification increased day by day. Summarized and input into the computer for processing, they had to work until late at night, around one or two o'clock. The total transaction amount for various items over five days exceeded 400 million yuan, forming a stark contrast with the current various somewhat quiet product exhibitions.

Statistics show that starting from the previous two years, the domestic technology market has hit a "low point," and the once-celebrated "tech boom" has quietly cooled down. It is precisely because of this that when organizing the National Star Program Achievements and Applicable Technology Exchange Fair, the organizers were quite worried. A leader from the Zhejiang Provincial Science and Technology Commission said that originally, we were concerned that enterprises are generally short of money, will they be willing to spend money on technology? Even reminding the staff to prepare for the embarrassment of "a deserted scene."

However, as the technology exchange fair approached, this science and technology commission leader began to get excited. Twenty-seven provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions specially organized teams to participate in the exchange fair. The originally planned tens of thousands of admission tickets were sold out before the opening. The Zhejiang economic circle quickly booked tens of thousands of tickets, and more than 30 city and county leaders personally brought batches of factory directors and managers. Even as the exchange fair was nearing its end, there were still streams of enterprise representatives coming to the news...

In the face of severe economic difficulties, science and technology have finally shown their attractive charm again.

A unit in Guangdong came to transfer a new printing technology. Before entering the exhibition hall, it was "blocked" at the accommodation by an informed enterprise and bought the technology for tens of millions of yuan in transfer fees.

A factory in Northeast China uses new processing and processing technologies to make ginseng. Due to the shrinking market for health products, the production tasks for next year are difficult to implement. Unexpectedly, the new technology made this ginseng sell well, and it was ordered for more than 10 million yuan, making the factory director very happy.

According to incomplete statistics, the transaction amount for technology transfer at this exchange fair reached more than 80 million yuan, and it also opened up sales channels for technological products worth several billion yuan.

According to the statistics of this exchange fair, among the tens of thousands of participants, factory directors and managers accounted for the majority. County-level leaders were particularly enthusiastic. A county magistrate who led the team said, "In the past, economic development always wanted to 'run ahead' and invest. Now this road is blocked, the key is to grasp technological progress."

A director of the Zhejiang Provincial Science and Technology Commission said with joy when talking about this exchange fair, "This seems to have come a little late, but this is indeed a welcome return!"

### “科技热”又回归——全国星火计划成果和技术交易会见闻

　　“科技热”又回归
　　——全国星火计划成果和技术交易会见闻
　　本报记者　高海浩
    西子湖畔的浙江展览馆涌动着川流不息的人群。令许多杭州市民不解的是：这里的许多商品是“贴”在墙上的，一排排外行人看不懂的数字加文字的技术介绍，竟有如此的吸引力？
    这是一次展示3000项星火技术、适用技术和技术产品的交易会，上至电子、生物工程的高技术，下涉日用小商品应用技术，包罗万象。使大会组织者始料不及的是：每天傍晚送来鉴证的交易合同单一天比一天多，汇总输入电脑处理，竟要忙到深夜一两点钟，5天的各种交易额突破4亿元，与时下各种颇为冷清的产品展销会形成鲜明的反差。
    有资料表明，前两年开始，国内技术市场跌入“低谷”，人们曾为之欣喜的“科技热”悄然降温。正是如此，在筹办全国星火成果和适用技术交易会时，组织者的心情是颇为忧虑的。浙江省科委领导说，原先我们担心现在企业普遍缺钱，肯花钱买技术吗？甚至提醒工作人员准备应付“门可罗雀”的尴尬场面。
    然而，随着技术交易会的临近，这位科委领导开始激动起来。27个省市自治区专门组团参加交易会，原先计划发售的数万张入场券没等开幕已经供不应求。捷足先登的浙江经济界一下子订走了上万张门票，还有30多个市、县的领导亲自带来了一批批厂长、经理。直至交易会已近尾声，仍有络绎不绝的企业代表团闻讯赶来……
    在经济界面临严峻困难之时，科技终于重显诱人的魅力。
    广东某单位前来转让一项印刷新技术，尚未进入展馆，就被一家消息灵通的企业“堵”在下榻处，并以几十万元的转让费买走。
    东北某厂采用新的加工、处理技术制作人参，由于滋补品市场萎缩，明年的生产任务难以落实。不料，新技术使这种人参销路大开，一下子被订走1000多万元，厂长欣喜不已。
    据不完全统计，这届交易会转让技术的成交额达8000多万元，还为价值数亿元的技术产品开辟了销路。
    据这次交易会的统计，在数万名与会者中，厂长、经理占居多数。县一级领导尤为热心。一位带队前来的县长说，过去搞经济总想“跑步（部）前（钱）进”要投资。现在这条路走不通了，关键是抓科技进步。
    浙江省科委一位主任谈及这届交易会时欣喜地说，这似乎来得晚了一些，但这毕竟是一个可喜的回归！
