In the 1970s, Chinese farmers discovered that the use of plastic film for soil covering brought them significant economic benefits. By the late 1980s, Chinese scientists warned that the residual plastic film could potentially harm the farmers.

Heilongjiang Province began promoting the use of plastic film for soil covering in 1979. That year, 600 mu (approximately 100 acres) of land were covered with plastic film. By 1987, this had increased to 3 million mu (approximately 500,000 acres). In the past two years, due to price fluctuations, the area covered with plastic film has remained around 1.6 million mu (approximately 267,000 acres), bringing about a "white revolution" in agriculture. However, in many places, the plastic film is covered but not cleaned up, and the next year, it is directly broken and plowed, causing a large amount of plastic film debris to be buried in the soil. According to expert experiments, one mu of vegetable field uses about 10 kilograms of plastic film. If not cleaned up, the first year will have 4.3 kilograms of residual film in the plow layer, the second year will have 8.6 kilograms, and the third year will increase to 13.3 kilograms. Based on this, it is estimated that the province has more than 10,000 tons of residual plastic film in the soil over three years. The residual plastic film in the soil does not dissolve or rot, causing serious harm by obstructing the transport of water and the growth of plant roots, which is not conducive to the germination and growth of crops, and can reduce the yield of grain crops by an average of 15%.

Farmers also reported that the residual plastic film debris on the plow gets stuck, making it difficult to plow; livestock mistakenly eat the residual plastic film, which can affect their work, and in severe cases, can cause illness and death.

For this reason, agricultural environmental protection experts in Heilongjiang Province have called for: strengthening propaganda to raise farmers' awareness of the hazards of residual plastic film pollution; using economic means to mobilize farmers' enthusiasm for recycling residual plastic film, and fundamentally eliminating the pollution and damage caused by residual plastic film to the agricultural environment.

### “白色生机”背后的“白色危机”

　　“白色生机”背后的“白色危机”
    70年代，中国农民发现地膜覆盖技术给他们带来了很大的经济效益；80年代末，中国科学家们又惊呼废膜残留将有可能使农民成为受害者。
    黑龙江省从1979年开始推广使用地膜覆盖技术，当年覆膜600亩，到1987年已经发展到300万亩，去今两年因价格影响，覆膜面积大体上也还保持在160万亩上下，给农业带来了一场“白色革命”。但是许多地方只覆盖不清理，来年直接破膜起垅，使大量的废膜碎片埋入土中。据专家试验，一亩菜地覆膜用量约10公斤，如不清理，第一年耕作层有残膜4.3公斤，第二年为8.6公斤，第三年则增加到13.3公斤。据此推算，全省3年残留在土中的废膜就超过1万吨。残留在土中的废膜不溶解、不腐烂，危害十分严重，阻碍水分的输送和植物根系的伸长，不利于作物的出苗生长，可使粮食作物平均减产15％。
    农民还反映：残留在土中的废膜碎片挂犁杖，不利于耕作；牲畜误食废膜，轻则影响使役，重则发病致死。
    为此黑龙江省的农业环保专家呼吁：加强宣传，提高农民对废膜污染危害的认识；运用经济手段，调动农民回收废膜的积极性，从根本上消除废膜对农业环境的污染与破坏。
