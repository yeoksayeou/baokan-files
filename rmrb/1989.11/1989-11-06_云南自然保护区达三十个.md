Yunnan Establishes Thirty Natural Reserves

KUNMING, Nov. 5 (Xinhua) — The mountainous and forested province of Yunnan has established 30 natural reserves, covering a total area of 18.22 million mu (1.215 million hectares), or 3.2 percent of the province's total area.

These reserves are playing an active role in improving the local ecological environment. A professional team of 780 people has been set up in the reserves. Under their protection, the number of rare wild animals in Yunnan has increased to varying degrees. The populations of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys, takins, South China tigers, and black-necked cranes, all of which are under first-class state protection, have grown.

In the Daxueshan Reserve in Yongde County, southwestern Yunnan, there are 18 rivers. In the past, these rivers would dry up in the dry season. Since the reserve was established in the early 1980s, the forest has recovered well, and now the 18 rivers flow with clear water all year round.

    云南自然保护区达三十个
    本报昆明十一月五日电  记者钱江报道：群山起伏、森林茂密的云南省已经建立起三十个自然保护区，总面积达一千八百二十二万亩，占全省总面积的百分之三点二。
    这些自然保护区对改善当地生态环境正发挥着积极作用。保护区已经建立起一支七百八十余人的专业队伍，在他们的保护下，云南珍稀野生动物数量有了不同程度的恢复和发展，滇金丝猴、羚牛、华南虎、黑颈鹤等国家一级保护动物的种群有了增加。
    滇西南永德县大雪山保护区有十八条河流，过去旱季断流。八十年代初建立保护区后，森林恢复得好，现在十八条河四季清水长流。
