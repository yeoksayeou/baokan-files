In every unit along the thousands of miles of the Tibetan border, you can find Tibetan officers with sun-tanned faces and sturdy builds. The commander of the Tibet Military Region, Major General Jiang Hongquan, and Deputy Political Commissar Zhou Yangyu, both Major Generals, happily told the reporter that after more than 30 years of unremitting efforts, the Tibetan officer corps in the military region has grown rapidly.

Statistics show that in the more than 30 years since the establishment of the Tibet Military Region, nearly 3,000 Tibetan officers have been trained. In addition to the more than 2,000 who have already been sent to local areas, there is now one Tibetan officer for every 10 officers on the roster. Compared to the time when the army marched into Tibet, the number of Tibetan officers has increased nearly a hundredfold.

Most of these Tibetan officers are former serfs or the descendants of serfs. Under the cultivation and education of the army, more than 95% of them have joined the Communist Party of China. After being preferentially selected for further education in military academies, 80% of them now have college or vocational degrees, with no illiterates, and 104 have obtained junior and intermediate technical titles. Currently, their ages also form a stepped structure.

Now, from platoon leaders to the military region's leadership, there are Tibetan comrades. Sixteen have taken on leadership roles at the military and division levels, and 164 have been awarded the rank of major or higher, including three major generals. Tibetan comrades account for 66% and 70% of the principal officials in military sub-regions and local military districts, respectively. In the struggle to build Tibet and defend the border, these Tibetan officers are playing an increasingly important role.

    西藏军区藏族军官成长快
    本报讯　在千里西藏边防的每个部队，都可以见到面庞黝红、身材魁梧的藏族军官。西藏军区司令员姜洪泉少将、副政委周扬余少将高兴地告诉笔者，经过30余年的不懈努力，全军区藏族军官队伍迅速成长。
    据统计，西藏军区成立30余年来，共培养了近3000名藏族军官。除已陆续向地方输送2000多人外，现每10名在编军官中就有一名藏族军官。这同当年进军西藏时相比，藏族军官人数增长了近百倍。
    这些藏族军官绝大多数是翻身农奴或农奴的后代，在部队的培养教育下，有95％以上的同志加入了中国共产党。经过优先选送院校深造，他们当中已有80％具有大、中专以上学历，无一文盲，并有104人获得初、中级技术职称。目前，他们的年龄也已形成梯形结构。
    现在，西藏军区从排长到军区领导，都有藏族同志。已有16人担任了军、师领导职务，有164人被授予少校以上军衔，其中，少将有3人。各军分区、人民武装部中的主官、藏族同志占66％和70％。在建设西藏和保卫边疆的斗争中，这些藏族军官正发挥越来越重要的作用。
