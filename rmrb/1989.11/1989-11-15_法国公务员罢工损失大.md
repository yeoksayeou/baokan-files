For over a year, since last summer, waves of strikes led primarily by state employees have surged in France, causing significant economic losses.

Since the summer of 1982, the French government has implemented a series of austerity measures, including fiscal tightening, reducing public spending, controlling price increases, limiting wage growth, raising interest rates, tightening monetary policy, implementing foreign exchange controls, restricting imports, promoting exports, and encouraging and supporting private investment. These measures have gradually helped France's economy to move from "stagflation" to a phase of low growth. In recent years, France's industrial investment has shown steady growth, with a 12% increase in 1988 and an expected 9% increase in 1989. Meanwhile, the economic growth rate has been on an upward trend since 1983, reaching 3.7% in 1988 and expected to maintain around 3.5% in 1989. Concurrently, inflation has been brought under control, with the inflation rate hovering around 3% over the past three years.

While France's economic situation has improved, the wage increases for most workers have lagged far behind the growth in the cost of living, presenting various challenges and pressures to society. The strikes by French civil servants aim to share in the benefits of economic growth.

The reason for the strikes by French civil servants is the worsening of their economic situation. Originally, civil service jobs were prestigious and secure. Apart from high-level officials, their salaries were not high, but they received numerous allowances, bonuses, and benefits, including material perks and vacations, making them respected and envied. However, since the French government implemented its austerity policies, the purchasing power of civil servants has declined by 8% over the past four years, while the average wage purchasing power in the private sector has slightly increased. Additionally, civil servants face heavy workloads, high labor intensity, and the threat of layoffs, leading to strong feelings of unfair treatment and growing dissatisfaction.

The strikes by French civil servants have caused substantial losses. It is estimated that the economic losses from just a few months of strikes last year exceeded 10 billion francs. For example, due to repeated strikes by Air France ground staff, lasting between 45 minutes and 3 hours each day, many flights did not receive the necessary technical support, forcing Air France to cancel 450 flights, resulting in a loss of 300 million francs due to flight cancellations and increased wages. Paris's metro and bus services were disrupted by maintenance workers' strikes, causing direct economic losses of 600 million francs. Postal sorting and delivery strikes resulted in the backlog of 120 million pieces of mail, with the postal service directly incurring losses of 135 million francs. Strikes in the postal, public transport, and electricity sectors caused daily economic losses of 500 million francs in the Paris region.

However, the nationwide strike by tax officials caused the most significant economic damage to France, as it severely disrupted the normal functioning of the entire social economy and resulted in substantial tax revenue losses: financial audits and economic statistics were suspended, goods awaiting customs clearance piled up at airports and ports, and even common items like stamp duty tickets became difficult to obtain.

The plight of French civil servants has garnered public sympathy, but their prolonged strikes have also caused widespread discontent and resentment. Some newspapers have commented that such strikes essentially take the general public as "hostages," using them as bargaining chips for certain union organizations, which has gone beyond the normal exercise of the right to strike.

    法国公务员罢工损失大
    杨贵兰
    自去年夏季以来的一年多时间里，以国家公务员为主体的罢工浪潮在法国此伏彼起，接连不断，造成了巨大的经济损失。
    自一九八二年夏季以来，法国政府采取紧缩财政、压缩公共开支，控制物价上涨，限制工资增长，提高利率、紧缩银根，实行外汇管制、限制进口、鼓励出口，鼓励和支持私人投资等措施，使其经济逐渐摆脱“滞胀”而走向低速增长。近几年来，法国的工业投资稳定增长，一九八八年为百分之十二，一九八九年可达百分之九；而其经济增长率则自一九八三年走出低谷之后，连续六年呈上升趋势，一九八八年达百分之三点七，一九八九年可望保持在百分之三点五左右。与此同时，法国的通货膨胀也得到了控制，近三年的通货膨胀率均在百分之三左右。
    法国的经济状况虽然有所好转，但大部分职工的工资增长幅度大大低于生活指数的增长，社会面临种种难题和压力。法国公务员此时掀起罢工浪潮，目的在于分享经济增长的好处。
    法国公务员之所以罢工，是因其经济处境每况愈下的缘故。原来，法国的公务员工作体面、职业有保障。除高级官员外，他们的工资不高，但补贴、奖金以及实物和休假等好处不少，是受人尊重、令人羡慕的。但自法国政府施行经济紧缩政策以来，公务员的实际购买力四年来下降了百分之八，而同期私营部门雇员的平均工资购买力却略有提高。另外，公务员工作负担重，劳动强度高，并且还有裁员之忧，因此，他们深感自己受到了不公平的待遇，不满情绪甚为强烈。
    法国公务员罢工造成的损失是很大的，据估计，仅去年几个月罢工造成的经济损失就高达一百亿法郎以上。例如，由于法航地勤轮番罢工，每天罢工四十五分钟至三小时，使许多飞机得不到应有的技术保障，法航被迫取消了四百五十个航班的飞行，公司因停航和增加工资损失了三亿法郎；巴黎地铁和公共汽车因车辆检修工罢工而使巴黎交通一度陷入混乱，造成的直接经济损失达六亿法郎；邮件分拣员和邮车司机罢工使一点二亿件邮件积压，邮电局直接承受的经济损失达一点三五亿法郎；邮电、公交和电力三个部门的罢工每天就使巴黎大区的经济损失多达五亿法郎。
    然而，全国财税人员的大罢工给法国经济造成的损失最大，因为它不仅严重影响了整个社会经济生活的正常运转，而且使国家的税收损失严重：财务审计、经济统计被迫中断，滞留在机场、港口等待过关的货物堆积如山，甚至连人们经常需要的印花税票也难以购得。
    法国公务员的境遇博得了公众舆论的同情，但其旷日持久的罢工给整个社会生活和社会秩序带来的影响也招致了人们的反感和不满。有些报刊评论指出，这样的罢工实际上是把广大消费者作为“人质”，作为某些工会组织进行讨价还价的筹码，这已超出正常行使罢工的界线。
