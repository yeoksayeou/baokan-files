Since autumn, the Inner Mongolian Xilingol League, which has achieved a bumper harvest in animal husbandry this year, has been vigorously pushing forward the purchase and sale of livestock during the autumn and winter seasons. The entire league will supply 2.5 million head (units) of commercial livestock to domestic and foreign markets.

In the process of livestock purchasing and selling, the league committee and the league government have formulated a series of policies and measures that are beneficial for purchasing and convenient for selling.

The entire league has set a unified price for livestock purchases. Based on net meat weight, beef cattle are priced at 4.2 yuan per kilogram, and mutton is priced at 4.4 yuan per kilogram. Depending on the convenience of transportation, prices can float within 5%. Fees incurred during the purchasing process are appropriately reduced or given preferential treatment. The management authority of livestock markets is delegated to the banners (counties/cities), and a certain number of live animals are allowed to be exported.
