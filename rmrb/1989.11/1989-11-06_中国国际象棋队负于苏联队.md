The second World Chess Team Championship entered its eighth day today. China's team lost 0.5 to 3.5 against the powerful Soviet team.

Today, China's team faced the Soviet team, which includes the defending champions, Olympic champions, and European champions. China's players were Ye Jiangchuan, Xu Jun, Ye Rongguang, and Wang Zili. Their opponents were the famous grandmasters Evgeny Vladimirovich Vasiukov, Rafael Vaganian, Artur Yussupov, and Igor Glebovich Gurevich.

The match began at 3 PM. Ye Jiangchuan remained calm under pressure and performed well technically. After nearly three hours of intense play, he drew with Vasiukov. Ye Rongguang faced Yussupov, and at one point, both players had a rook, bishop, and three pawns each. However, Ye Rongguang's consideration was not thorough enough, and his endgame skills were not as strong as his opponent's, resulting in a loss. Xu Jun and Wang Zili were also defeated due to their inferior strength.

The Swiss team defeated the Hungarian team with a score of 2.5 to 1.5; the British team defeated the Dutch team with the same score; the Yugoslav team tied with the Cuban team 2 to 2; the American team's match with the African team ended last, and the Americans won 2.5 to 1.5. So far, the Soviet team has won all seven of its matches, accumulating 21.5 points, and is likely to retain the championship. The British and Yugoslav teams each have 16 points, but they still face the American team, which is only 0.5 points behind, in the fight for second place in this tournament. China's team is currently tied for eighth place with the Dutch team, each with 10 points.

    中国国际象棋队负于苏联队
    新华社卢塞恩11月4日电　（记者施光耀）第二届国际象棋世界团体锦标赛今天进入第八天，中国队以0.5∶3.5受挫于实力雄厚的苏联队。
    中国队今天迎战上届冠军、奥林匹克冠军和欧洲冠军苏联队的选手是：叶江川、徐俊、叶荣光和汪自力，对手则是埃尔维斯特、瓦加尼安、伊万絮克和古里瓦奇四位著名国际特级大师。
    比赛于下午3点开始。叶江川临阵不慌，技术发挥正常，经过不到3个小时的拚杀，与埃尔维斯特打了个平手。叶荣光与伊万絮克对阵，一度形成了双方同为车象3兵的局势，由于叶荣光考虑欠周，且残局功夫不如对手，结果失算致输。徐俊和汪自力也因实力不济而败北。
    瑞士队以2.5∶1.5的比分战胜匈牙利队；英国队打败荷兰队，比分也是2.5∶1.5；南斯拉夫队与古巴队2∶2战平；美国队与非洲联队的比赛结束最晚，最后美国队以2.5∶1.5告捷。迄今为止，苏联队七战七胜，积分已达21.5分，蝉联冠军大致已定。英国队和南斯拉夫队同积16分，但它们在争夺本届比赛第二名的过程中还面临着只比上述两队差0.5积分的美国队。中国队暂时与荷兰队并列第八，同积10分。
