The People's Insurance Company of China, Liaoning Branch, has been actively promoting insurance services in the "Vegetable Basket" project, thereby accelerating its development.

Vegetable and fruit production in Liaoning is significantly affected by natural factors, and farmers are often hesitant to invest due to fears of labor and financial losses. The provincial insurance company conducted a survey on this issue and initiated insurance services for vegetable production to boost farmers' confidence. After the Anshan City Jiubao District vegetable production base joined the insurance program, farmers no longer feared natural disasters. They constructed over 900 vegetable greenhouses, more than 1,800 acres of greenhouses, and 260,000 acres of vegetable fields.

In the "Vegetable Basket" project, various levels of insurance companies in Liaoning do not merely passively compensate for losses. They collaborate with relevant departments, combining insurance with prevention, emphasizing prevention. The Jinzhou area, for instance, suffers from a lack of rain but frequent hailstorms, which significantly impact vegetables and fruit trees. The provincial insurance company invested 100,000 yuan to purchase anti-hail cannon ammunition and set up five anti-hail stations with the help of the Shenyang Meteorological Research Center. This year, despite multiple hailstorms, all were effectively mitigated, ensuring that vegetables and fruits were largely unaffected.

### 为菜农壮胆撑腰　辽宁保险公司推进“菜篮子”工程

　　为菜农壮胆撑腰
　　辽宁保险公司推进“菜篮子”工程
    本报沈阳11月26日电　记者段心强报道：中国人民保险公司辽宁分公司在“菜篮子”工程中开展保险工作，从而加速了这一建设。
    辽宁的蔬菜瓜果生产受自然影响较大，农民生怕劳民伤财，一般不愿意种植。省保险公司调查了这一情况，便在蔬菜生产中开展保险业务，给农民壮胆撑腰。鞍山市旧堡区蔬菜生产基地入保后，菜农不再怕自然灾害的袭击，搞起蔬菜大棚900多个、温室1800多亩、蔬菜地26万亩。
    在“菜篮子”工程中开展保险，辽宁各级保险公司不是消极地赔款。他们和有关部门合作，保防结合，以防为主。锦州一带缺雨，却又经常下冰雹，对蔬菜和果树影响很大。省保险公司出钱10万元，请沈阳区域气象研究中心出技术，购置防雹炮弹，设了5个防雹点。今年多次发生雹灾，全部被打消，保证蔬菜水果基本不受影响。
