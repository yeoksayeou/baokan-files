Cambodian Resistance Forces Capture a Military Outpost in Phnom Penh

Vietnam Recently Sent 3,000 Troops to Cambodia

Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, November 10th: According to reports from Bangkok newspapers today, citing information from the United States and Cambodian resistance forces, the Khmer People's National Liberation Front's forces captured a forward outpost of the Phnom Penh military on November 8th and captured 40 prisoners.

The report said that the 6th Brigade of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, stationed in the western part of Cambodia in Battambang, attacked an outpost of the Heng Samrin forces, which was only 50 meters away from their base.

In the brief battle, the liberation forces destroyed a loaded truck, seized three rifles, and 300 bags of rice.

Another report said that fierce battles between Heng Samrin's forces and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea are still ongoing in the southern part of Phnom Penh.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 10th: According to a news release from the General Headquarters of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea broadcasted today by the radio station of Democratic Kampuchea, Vietnam recently sent an additional 3,000 troops to Cambodia.

The news release, signed on November 8th, said that after the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea captured the strategic town of Banteay Meanchey and the city of Samlot, Vietnam believed that the Phnom Penh puppet army, along with Vietnamese military advisors and some disguised Vietnamese troops, could not withstand the Cambodian resistance forces in the confrontation. Therefore, it was necessary to urgently send military advisors and troops to Banteay Meanchey.

The news release said that on November 2nd, approximately 2,400 Vietnamese soldiers dressed in Phnom Penh puppet military uniforms, aboard 80 vehicles, crossed the border and traveled along Highway 1 to Phnom Penh. They then proceeded along Highway 5, through Pursat and Battambang, to Banteay Meanchey. The next day, another 520 Vietnamese soldiers, disguised as Phnom Penh puppet soldiers, aboard 18 vehicles, arrived in Pursat via the aforementioned route. Before this, the Phnom Penh puppet defense minister, Dib Ban, flew to Banteay Meanchey with 50 Vietnamese military commanders to strengthen local defenses and reorganize the remnants that had retreated from Banteay Meanchey, Samlot, Sisophon, and Ta Moa.

The news release believes that this shows that Vietnam has not yet given up on Cambodia.

    柬抵抗力量攻克金边军队一据点
    越南本月初向柬增兵三千人
    新华社曼谷11月10日电  据曼谷报纸今天援引美国和柬埔寨抵抗力量方面的消息说，高棉人民民族解放阵线部队11月8日攻克金边军队的一个前哨据点，并抓获40名俘虏。
    消息说，驻扎在柬埔寨西部农占的高棉人民民族解放阵线第六团攻打的是距其驻地仅50米的韩桑林部队的据点。
    短战中，解放阵线的部队摧毁了一辆载重卡车，缴获三支步枪和300袋大米。
    另报道，韩桑林部队和民柬国民军之间的激战还在梅莱山南部进行。
    新华社北京11月10日电  据民主柬埔寨电台今天广播的民柬国民军总司令部新闻公报揭露，越南本月初，又向柬埔寨增兵3000人。
    这份8日签发的新闻公报说，在民柬国民军攻克马德望省战略重镇拜林市和三洛县城之后，越南认为，金边伪军加上越军顾问及部分伪装的越军部队现在在较量中是抵挡不住柬埔寨抵抗力量的，因此，必须紧急向马德望市增派军事顾问和军队。
    公报说，11月2日，大约2400名穿金边伪军军装的越南军队分乘80辆汽车，越过边境，沿1号公路到达金边市，尔后又沿5号公路，经磅清扬市、菩萨市到达马德望。次日，又有520余名伪装成金边伪军的越南士兵乘18辆汽车，沿上述路线抵达菩萨市。在此之前，金边伪国防部长迪班同50名越南军事指挥官飞抵马德望市，以加强当地防务，并把从拜林、三洛、诗梳风、特莫博等地溃退下来的残部加以重建。
    公报认为，这表明，越南至今没有放弃柬埔寨。
