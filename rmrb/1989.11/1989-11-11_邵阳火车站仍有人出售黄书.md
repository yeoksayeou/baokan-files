On the afternoon of October 18, I was in the waiting room of Shaoyang Railway Station in Hunan Province. I saw a middle-aged, overweight man dressed in a railway uniform and a middle-aged woman selling books, calling out to passengers to buy them. I intentionally flipped through a few books and found that most of them were pornographic publications that should be confiscated. The titles were shocking, such as "Lustful Women," "Virgin Dreams," and "Debauched Women." Some books had no titles or publishing houses, only provocative images and headlines on the cover, such as "Borderless Love—The Experiences of a Chinese Man in Sexually Liberal Western Countries." These publications mostly featured naked or semi-naked men and women on the cover, with content summaries that mostly reflected debauched male-female bedroom activities. Inside, there were also unmentionable illustrations. The woman said to an elderly man in his 50s, "Buy a book to read on the train!" The elderly man said, "You're selling books with naked women, I dare not look!" The woman selling the books immediately cursed the elderly man, "You're blind!" Right next to the bookstand, two duty personnel were standing, and there were several station staff inside the room, but no one stopped this illegal behavior.

    邵阳火车站仍有人出售黄书
    10月18日下午，我在湖南邵阳火车站候车室门内，看到一位身穿铁路制服的中年胖男子和一位中年妇女在摆书摊，招呼候车旅客买书。我有意翻了几本，发现大部分都属应查禁收缴的黄色书刊。书名触目惊心，什么《荒淫艳女》、《黄花处女梦》、《艳女渣滓》等。有一些书刊无刊名，无出版单位，封面上仅有刺激性画面和标题，如《无国界的情爱——在性开放的西方一个中国美男子的遭遇等》。这些书刊大都是裸体半裸体男女封面，内容简介中大多反映男女床第生活等荒淫内容，里面还有不堪入目的插图。那女的对着一位50多岁的老同志说：“买本书火车上看吧！”老同志说“你卖这些不穿衣服的女人书，不敢看哩！”卖书女人立即骂老同志“瞎了眼！”就在书摊旁站着两名值勤人员，室内还有多名车站工作人员，竟无人制止这种不法行为。
