Panama's State Council decided on November 9 to reestablish the National Assembly of People's Representatives, with Army Commander General Noriega serving as the coordinator. It is believed that this measure strengthens Noriega's ruling position.

This decision was made by the State Council, composed of members from Panama's cabinet, military, and the leadership of the National Assembly of People's Representatives, during a special meeting.

The National Assembly of People's Representatives was established in 1972.

The State Council granted the new National Assembly of People's Representatives, consisting of 510 representatives, extensive powers, including the right to vote on international treaties before their approval, declare war, grant amnesty, and propose countermeasures against possible U.S. aggression.
