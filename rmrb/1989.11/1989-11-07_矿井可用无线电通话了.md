	Wireless Communication Now Available in Mines

	According to a report, the KLT-1 type mine wireless leaky communication system was recently approved at the Fanggezhuang Mine of the Kailuan Mining Bureau. This is a key scientific and technological project of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" and is at the international advanced level of the 1980s.

	This communication system, developed by the Fushun Branch of the Coal Science Academy and the Hebei Jiguang Technology Development Company, solves the problem of wireless signals not being able to transmit over long distances in the non-free space of underground tunnels. It achieves free communication between various tunnels, transport vehicles, cages, and surface locations in the mine, bringing convenience to production command, mine rescue, and other work.

    矿井可用无线电通话了
    本报讯　前不久，KLT—1型矿井无线电漏泄通信系统在开滦范各庄矿通过鉴定。这是我国“七五”计划的重点科技攻关项目，具有80年代国际先进水平。
    这套由煤炭科学院抚顺分院和河北冀光技术开发公司研制的通信系统，解决了无线电波在地下巷道非自由空间中不能远距离传输的难题，实现了井下各巷道和运输车、罐笼及地面各处的自由通话，给指挥生产、矿山救护等工作带来了便利。
