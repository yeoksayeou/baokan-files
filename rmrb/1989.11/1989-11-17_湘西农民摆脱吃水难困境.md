    Schools where students have to carry water in bottles, a common sight in western Hunan, are now rarely seen. One of the 14 impoverished regions in China, the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, has, in recent years, mobilized thousands of households to work together, freeing its ethnic minority residents from water scarcity.

    Western Hunan is characterized by rugged terrain, deep river valleys, and numerous underground caves, resulting in widespread dry areas across its eight counties and two cities. Nearly a quarter of the population and 300,000 livestock face drinking water difficulties. Starting in 1985, the Xiangxi Autonomous Prefecture adopted measures such as public works in exchange for relief, rallying the masses to work hard and improve their living conditions.

    Over the past few years, the prefecture has constructed 1,384 water supply projects for humans and livestock, providing clean water for 263,000 Tujia and Miao farmers and solving the drinking water problem for 240,000 head of livestock. Additionally, 20,000 acres of farmland have been irrigated.

    湘西农民摆脱吃水难困境
    本报长沙11月16日电　记者杜若原报道：学生上学要带水的“酒瓶学校”，如今在湘西很少见到了。全国14个贫困片之一的湘西土家族苗族自治州，近几年组织千家万户投工投劳，使少数民族同胞从缺水的困境中解脱出来。
    湘西地表重岩叠嶂、河谷深切，地下溶洞成群，干旱死角遍布全州8县2市，近1／4的人口和30万头牲畜饮水困难。从1985年起，湘西自治州采取以工代赈等办法，发动群众艰苦奋斗改变生活环境。
    几年来，全州兴建人畜饮水工程1384处，使26.3万土家族、苗族农民喝上了卫生水，24万头牲畜饮水也得以解决，并结合灌溉农田2万亩。
