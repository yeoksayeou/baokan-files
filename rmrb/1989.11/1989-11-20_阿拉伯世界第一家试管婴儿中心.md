The 48-year-old Mrs. Salima joyfully gave birth to her test-tube baby this year. She named her daughter Habtura, meaning "a gift from Allah." Mrs. Salima suffers from infertility and for over 20 years, she sought a child from one doctor to another without success, until she finally found good fortune at the Jordan Infertility Medical Center. Jordan now has 62 test-tube babies, and Habtura is one of them.

This first infertility medical center in the Arab world has, since 1985, treated over 500 infertile women, many of whom come from countries outside Jordan.

The person who introduced in vitro fertilization technology to Jordan is Dr. Zaid Kairani. He enthusiastically walks among women, still in his white coat after a day's work, introducing: "At that time, this work was a new scientific and technological challenge. Shortly after the first successful trial in Britain in 1978, I wanted to bring it to Jordan, but I received many warnings from friends. They doubted the plan, thinking it wouldn't work in a country where the majority are Muslims. However, through effort, we finally succeeded."

Dr. Kairani's work received help from many enlightened individuals. Islamic legal scholars, after reviewing and studying Islamic law on artificial insemination and test-tube babies, concluded that if insemination is only between husband and wife, it is permissible, with the principle of ensuring pure lineage.

After gaining approval in 1985, Dr. Kairani established a small clinic and purchased the necessary experimental equipment and instruments. After several trials, he successfully conducted artificial insemination. In March 1987, Jordan's first test-tube male baby was born here. Last year, he moved into a new building on the outskirts of the capital, with high walls and a beautiful garden. This Jordan Infertility Treatment Center now has a medical team of 25, including doctors, laboratory technicians, and administrators.

The center's work has developed significantly, mainly due to changes in people's and society's understanding and attitudes toward test-tube babies. Initially, people believed that having children was Allah's arrangement and could not be changed by human will. Many who underwent treatment felt proud to have test-tube babies, as it meant love and hope for the family. Now, this work is accepted by more and more people. The success rate of artificial insemination at this center is 12%, comparable to the level of infertility treatment centers worldwide, and the fees are also reasonable. Kairani said his medical center is a national cause, not for profit. In many cases, they offer preferential treatment. When he sees a woman who wants treatment but cannot afford it, the medical center will provide assistance.

    阿拉伯世界第一家试管婴儿中心
    牛进萍
    今年48岁的萨莉玛女士幸福地生下她的试管女婴。她给女儿起名叫哈白图拉，意思是安拉的赐物。萨莉玛女士患不孕症，20多年来为了要个孩子，从一个医生找到另一个医生都未如愿，一直到了约旦不孕症医疗中心才交了好运。约旦现已有62个男女试管婴儿降生，哈白图拉就是其中之一。
    这个阿拉伯世界第一个不孕症医疗中心自从1985年从事这项工作以来，治愈了500多名不育妇女，其中有很多人来自约旦以外的国家。　　把试管婴儿技术引进约旦的是扎伊德·凯拉尼博士。他工作一天白大褂还未脱就兴致勃勃地走到妇女中间，向她们介绍：当时这项工作是新的科学和技术的挑战。1978年在英国首次试验成功不久，我就想把它引进约旦，但受到很多朋友警告，他们怀疑这项计划，认为在一个绝大部分人信仰伊斯兰教的国家里行不通，然而经过努力终于取得了成功。
    凯拉尼博士的事业得到不少有识之士的帮助。伊斯兰教法律学家就人工授精和试管婴儿一事翻阅和研究了伊斯兰教法律之后，认为如果仅在夫妇之间进行授精是允许的，以保障血缘的纯正为准绳。
    凯拉尼博士在1985年获得同意之后，着手建立了一个小诊所，并购置了必要的试验设备和仪器。经过多次的试验，他终于成功的进行人工授精，1987年3月，约旦第一个试管男婴在这里诞生。去年，他搬进了位于首都郊区的一幢新房，有高高的围墙和漂亮的花园。这个约旦治疗不育症中心，眼下已有一支包括医生、化验员、管理员等25人组成的医疗队伍。
    该中心的工作之所以有长足发展，主要是由于人们和整个社会对试管婴儿工作的认识和态度有了很大的改变。起初，人们认为生儿育女是安拉安排的，而不能以人的意志为转移。通过治疗的很多人为能生下试管婴儿感到自豪，因为它意味着家庭有了爱和希望。现在这项工作被越来越多的人所接受。在这个中心，人工授精的成功率达12％，可与世界治疗不孕症的医疗所或医疗中心的水平相媲美，而且收费也较合理。凯拉尼说，他的医疗中心是民族的事业，目的不是为了赚钱，很多情况是优待的。当他看到某位妇女想治病，但又付不起钱时，医疗中心便会向她提供帮助。
