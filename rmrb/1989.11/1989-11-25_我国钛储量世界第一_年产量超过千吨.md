	China's titanium industry, which was virtually non-existent 40 years ago, has rapidly developed since the founding of the People's Republic. Currently, China's proven reserves rank first in the world, and the annual output exceeds 1,000 tons, also placing it among the world's leading producers.

	Titanium is a hard and lightweight silver-white metal. It is widely used in aerospace, nuclear power plants, titanium submarines, deep-sea oil drilling, resource development, and ocean thermal energy conversion, as well as in electroplating and light industry. It is poised to become the "third metal" after iron and aluminum. China's titanium resources are mainly found in Sichuan, Hebei, and the southeastern coastal regions.

　　我国钛储量世界第一
　　年产量超过千吨
    新华社北京11月23日电  （通讯员何文品）40年前尚属空白的我国钛工业，建国以来迅速崛起。目前已探明的储量居世界第一位，年产量超过1000吨，也居世界前列。
    钛质硬而轻，是一种银白色金属。它已广泛用于太空业、原子能电站、钛潜艇、深海石油钻探、资源开发和海水温差发电及电镀、轻工等领域。它将成为仅次于铁、铝的“第三金属”。我国钛资源主要产于四川、河北及东南沿海地区。
