China's sugar beet sugar production has exceeded 100 million tons. The Xinhua News Agency reported from Harbin on November 1st: (Reporter Li Guangjun) The reporter learned from the recently concluded national sugar beet sugar production meeting that China's 1988-1989 sugar beet sugar production reached 123.02 million tons, an increase of 67.9% over the previous production period, surpassing 100 million tons for the first time and reaching the highest level in history.

Relevant experts analyzed that the increase in sugar beet sugar production has eased the tight supply of sugar in China. However, due to the low sugar price, farmers' enthusiasm for planting sugar beets is not high, and the area of sugar beet planting has sharply decreased this year. The sugar beet sugar production in the 1989-1990 period may significantly decline.

    我甜菜制糖突破百万吨
    新华社哈尔滨十一月一日电　（记者刘广军）记者从刚刚结束的全国甜菜制糖生产汇报会上获悉：我国一九八八—一九八九年度甜菜产糖一百二十三点○二万吨，比上个生产期增长百分之六十七点九，首次突破百万吨，创历史最好水平。
    有关专家分析，甜菜糖增产缓解了我国食糖供应的紧张状况，但由于糖价低，农民种植甜菜的积极性不高，今年的甜菜种植面积锐减，一九八九—一九九○年度甜菜制糖产量可能大幅度回落。
