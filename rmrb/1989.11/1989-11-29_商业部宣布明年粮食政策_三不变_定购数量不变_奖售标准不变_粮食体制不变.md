Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily reporters Chen Yun and Pan Gang report: Vice Minister of Commerce He Jihai announced today in Beijing that the contracted purchase quantity for grain in 1990 will remain unchanged; the policy of linking grain purchases with subsidies for fertilizers, diesel, and advance payments will continue, with the central government's subsidy standards remaining unchanged; and the grain system will remain unchanged.

He Jihai said that the focus of the grain department's work in 1990 will be to stabilize the grain contract policy, ensure the purchase and sale of grain and oil, and arrange for the people's livelihood.

Regarding the issue of high market grain prices and insufficient central financial subsidies for negotiated grain purchases raised by various regions, He Jihai said that the State Council has clearly stated that the central government will not increase the subsidy amount, and each region will solve the problem on its own to control grain sales, promote production in grain-deficient regions, and improve self-sufficiency levels.

After the grain purchase, sale, allocation, and financial contract for the 1988-1990 period expires, should it be continued or should another method be adopted? He Jihai said that we believe that the central government's contract system with local governments is beneficial for mobilizing the enthusiasm of both the central and local governments. It is beneficial for promoting the rational adjustment of agricultural structure, developing grain production, controlling grain consumption, and improving the self-sufficiency level of grain-deficient regions. If the contract system is not implemented, the central government will arrange all the surpluses and shortages, and it will be difficult to meet the requirements in terms of variety and quantity. He said that the specific methods of the contract system need to be further improved and perfected.

    商业部宣布明年粮食政策“三不变”
　　定购数量不变　奖售标准不变　粮食体制不变
    本报北京11月28日讯　新华社记者陈芸、本报记者潘岗报道：商业部副部长何济海今天在此间宣布：1990年粮食合同定购数量不变；定购粮食继续实行与奖售化肥、柴油和发放预购定金“三挂钩”的政策，中央奖售的标准不变；粮食体制不变。
    何济海说，1990年粮食部门的工作重点将是稳定粮食包干政策，抓好粮油购销工作，安排好人民生活。
    关于各地反映的市场粮价较高，中央财政对议价粮收购补贴不足问题，何济海说，对此国务院已明确表示，中央不再增加补贴金额，由各地自行解决，以利于控制粮食销售，促进缺粮地区发展生产，提高自给水平。
    1988年至1990年度的粮食购销、调拨和财务包干到期后，是继续包下去还是另定办法？何济海说，我们认为，中央对地方实行包干制度，有利于发挥中央和地方两个积极性，对促进合理调整农业结构，发展粮食生产，控制粮食消费，提高缺粮地区自给水平，都有好处。如不实行包干，各地余缺都由中央安排，在品种、数量上很难满足要求。他说，包干的具体办法需要进一步完善和改进。
