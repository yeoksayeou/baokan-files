The 17-day European Environmental Conference concluded this afternoon in Sofia.

The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reported that during the conference, representatives from the 35 countries participating in the CSCE discussed various constructive issues regarding the most urgent ecological and environmental protection problems in Europe. The results achieved were positive. The representatives believed that ecological issues have a global nature and require the combined efforts of all countries to promote international cooperation for the protection of Europe's natural environment.

However, during the conference, some Western countries' representatives took advantage of the host country's hospitality, enthusiasm, and the platform provided to exert pressure on Bulgaria regarding so-called "human rights" and "ecological transparency." They even openly supported organizations that the Bulgarian government does not recognize, such as the "Ecological Transparency Organization" and the "Club for Reform and Transparency," in holding rallies and demonstrations against the Bulgarian government and state power. They used this opportunity to attack Bulgaria's domestic and foreign policies.

Additionally, representatives from the United States, Britain, and other countries held press conferences, inviting individuals released by the Bulgarian authorities and labeled as "political prisoners" to speak at the conferences, allowing them to make statements that defamed the Bulgarian government. They also attended press conferences held by leaders of Bulgarian illegal organizations, supporting their anti-government activities and statements.

Observers here believe that the activities of Western countries' representatives violated the principles and spirit of the CSCE. On October 21, the Bulgarian newspaper "Rabotnichesko Delo" published an editorial warning that illegal organizations supported by certain Western countries should not abuse Bulgaria's expanding democracy and freedom. The editorial emphasized that Bulgaria will not allow any destructive forces to obstruct the country's development and the socialist path chosen by its people.

### 欧洲环保会议在索非亚闭幕  一些西方国家代表借机支持保非法组织

    欧洲环保会议在索非亚闭幕
    一些西方国家代表借机支持保非法组织
    新华社索非亚11月3日电  （记者王金柏）为期17天的欧洲环保会议于3日下午在索非亚闭幕。
    保通社的报道认为，会议期间，参加欧安会的35国的代表在会上就欧洲最迫切的生态和环境保护问题进行了各种建设性的讨论，所取得的结果是积极的。各国代表团认为生态问题带有全球性质，必须联合各国的力量，促进各国为保护全欧洲的自然环境而不断扩大国际合作。
    然而，会议期间一些西方国家的代表利用东道国的好客、热情和提供的讲坛，就所谓“人权”和“生态污染公开性”问题在会上向保加利亚施加压力。他们甚至公开支持保加利亚政府不予承认的“生态公开性组织”和“支持改革与公开性俱乐部”等非法组织举行针对保政府和国家政权的集会和示威，借机攻击保加利亚的内外政策。
    此外，美、英等国代表团举行记者招待会，安排被保加利亚当局释放的所谓“政治犯”到记者招待会，让他们发表中伤保加利亚政府的讲话。他们还参加保非法组织的头头举行的家庭记者招待会，支持这些人的反政府活动和言论。
    此间观察家认为，西方国家代表的这些活动违背了欧安会的原则精神。10月21日，保《工人事业报》为此曾发表社论，警告受到某些西方国家支持的非法组织不要滥用保加利亚不断扩大的民主和自由。社论强调，保加利亚绝不允许各种破坏势力阻挡国家的发展和人民已经选择的社会主义道路。
