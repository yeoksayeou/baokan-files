This time, while on assignment at the border, the first thing I thought of was visiting Elder Sister Early Heat Wood.

She lives in a small village on the border. With the help of a kind-hearted Uyghur young man, my car wound through the village and finally stopped in front of Elder Sister Early Heat Wood's home. Just as she was about to go out, she saw me, dusty from the journey, and paused for a moment. "Oh, little sister!" She immediately came over and hugged me tightly. I could distinctly hear her heart beating rapidly and her uneven breathing. I was hugged so tightly that I could barely breathe. "I've missed you so much, little sister." Her eyes welled up with tears. "Me too," I replied, my eyes also moistening. We entered the house, and the first thing I saw was a framed photograph on the wall. A picture of me in my military uniform was prominently displayed in the center. She held my hand, her beautiful eyes never leaving my face. I felt embarrassed and shyly pulled my hand back. She realized she had been a bit too forward and quickly guided me to sit on the edge of the bed, then went to make tea.

At that moment, a few Uyghur women passed by her courtyard. I heard Elder Sister's voice: "My little sister is here, the soldier sister I often told you about is here." "Where is she?" "In the house." They came in, their eyes fixed on me. "Oh, you're the soldier sister, you're so good!" I was at a loss, feeling bewildered. Fortunately, Elder Sister came in and rescued me. "I've told everyone in the village about the time in the hospital," she said. "What happened?" I asked, puzzled. "When I had surgery, there was no one to take care of me. If it weren't for you coming every day to take care of me, to buy me food..." Elder Sister choked up. "In the hot summer, you fanned me, bought a radio for me. We, the villagers, couldn't do that," an older woman said.

Oh, that was nothing, I just had some free time and found something to do. Besides, last year when I was in the hospital, during the month I spent with Elder Sister Early Heat Wood, I not only learned a lot of Uyghur language and customs, but I also learned a lot about how to be a good person. Those days were so happy and meaningful.

I remember when her husband came to take her home, she hugged me, her tears soaking my shoulder. Although I had experienced many partings, none were as unforgettable as this. She wanted to take a photo with me, but it didn't work out, so I chose a photo of myself that I liked and gave it to her.

Later, we never saw each other again. She wrote me a few letters. Although she spoke fluent Mandarin, she couldn't write it, so every time I received a letter from her, I had to find a Uyghur friend to translate it. When replying, I always had it translated into Uyghur before sending it. Whenever someone from the village came to the city, she would have them look for me and pass on my news to her.

Due to my ongoing assignment, I had to hastily say goodbye to these kind and friendly people.

Under the lamplight, we were having a discussion with the border guards. The sentry reported that a woman and two men from a Uyghur family were carrying large and small baskets looking for me. I guessed the woman must be Elder Sister Early Heat Wood. Sure enough, it was her, along with her husband and a university student from the village who had returned home for a holiday, having traveled 5 kilometers to see me. Her husband had just returned from the fields, without even washing the dust from his face, drinking water, or eating, he rushed to the store to buy a large pile of gifts for me. Elder Sister Early Heat Wood brought all the eggs she had saved up and didn't hesitate to give them to me. They expressed their feelings in this way, without any pretension. I saw the mud on their feet and knew they must have stepped into the marshland multiple times. My vision blurred, and my throat felt blocked. I wanted to say something, but I couldn't find the words. I refused to accept the gifts. They got angry, and for the first time, I saw Elder Sister Early Heat Wood get angry. "You throw away the gifts, you look down on us." She had told me that Uyghurs value relationships deeply, and if a gift is not accepted, it is like a slap in the face, showing disrespect and unwillingness to maintain a long-term relationship. I had no choice but to accept the gifts and leave them with the border guards. I thought that the soldiers, knowing the origin of these gifts, would surely enjoy them even more.

They left, walking under the moonlight back to their small village.

Watching their departing figures, I said to myself, "I only did a little thing without much thought, why do you cherish what others give you so dearly, and possibly remember it for life? I feel ashamed; I often hesitate to do small favors that benefit both others and myself..."

    早热木大姐
    韩萍
    这次到边防采访，想起的头一件事便是去看望早热木大姐。
    她就住在边境的一个小村落。在热心的维吾尔族小伙子指引下，我坐的车子七拐八转，终于停在了早热木大姐家的门前。正要出门的早热木大姐，看见了风尘仆仆的我，稍一愣，“哦，妹妹！”她一下子上来拥住了我。我真切地听到她心率急剧加快的“砰砰”声和不均匀的呼吸声，我被她紧紧地拥抱着，有点喘不过气来了。“我太想你了，妹妹。”她眼含热泪。“我也是。”我也情不自禁地湿润了眼睛。我们进了屋，我第一眼看到的便是墙上的相框，我穿军装的照片嵌在正中央。她握着我的手，美丽的大眼睛始终不离开我的脸庞。我被她看窘了，羞涩地将手抽回去。她意识到自己有些失态，赶忙把我按在炕头坐下，去烧奶茶。
    这时，有几个维吾尔族妇女路过她家院子，我听到大姐的声音：“我妹妹来了，我经常给你们说的那个女兵妹妹来了。”“在哪里？”“就在屋里”。她们走了进来，眼睛火辣辣地盯着我，“噢，你就是那个女兵，你真好！”我不知所措，感到莫名其妙。幸亏早热木大姐进来解了围，“我把在医院的事都告诉全村人了，他们早就想见见你。”“什么事呀？”我纳闷。“我做手术，身边无人照顾，如果不是你每天照料我，为我买饭……”早热木大姐竟哽咽起来。“大热天你为她扇扇子，买收音机，我们是乡亲都做不到。”一位年长的妇女说。
    哎，那算什么呀，我不过是闲得慌，找些事做罢了，值得这么渲染？再说，我去年住院，与早热木大姐相处的一个月里，不但跟她学会不少维吾尔语言，知道了很多少数民族风情，还懂得不少做人的道理。那日子过得多快活、多实在。
    记得她丈夫接早热木大姐回去时，她搂着我，泪水打湿了我的肩头。尽管我经历过很多次的别离，但哪一次也没有这样让人难忘。她要和我拍张合影，但未能如愿，我只好选了一张自己比较满意的照片送给她。
    后来，我们再也没见过面，她给我写过几封信，尽管她的汉语说得相当流利，但不会写，因此，每收到她的信我都要去找维吾尔族朋友翻译，而回信总是翻译成维吾尔语才给她寄出。村里有人来城里，她总让他们看看我，把我的信息传给她。
    由于我还有采访任务，不得不匆匆告别这些善良而又可亲的人们。
    灯下，我们正和边防战士座谈。哨兵报告，有一女两男三个维吾尔族农民提着大包小篮找我。我猜想那女的便是早热木大姐。果不出所料，是她和丈夫及村里一位放假归来的大学生，赶了5公里路来。她丈夫刚从田头回家，没顾上洗去脸上的尘垢，没顾上喝一口水，吃一口饭，便上商店买了一大堆送我的东西。早热木大姐把一个个攒起来舍不得吃的鸡蛋毫不吝啬地全拿来了。他们用这种方式表达感情，丝毫没有做作。我看到他们脚上的泥巴，就知道他们路过沼泽地时脚不止一次陷了进去。我的眼前一片模糊，我的嗓子像堵了块东西，我想说，可什么也说不出，也不知道说什么。东西我坚决不收。他们发火了，我第一次见早热木大姐发火，“你把东西全扔了，你看不起我们。”她曾告诉我，维吾尔人很重情意，送你礼物如不被接收，那等于打了一记耳光，表示看不起这人，不愿与之长交。我只好把东西收下，留给边防站的战士。我想，战士们知道了这些东西的来历，吃起来一定会更有一番滋味。
    他们走了，披着月色走向他们的小村落。
    望着他们远去的背影，我在心里说：“我只是不在意地做了一点事，你们为什么把别人给予的那一丁点看得那么贵重，而且有可能终生不忘呢？我很羞愧，我常常不愿做举手之劳于人于己都有利的事……”
