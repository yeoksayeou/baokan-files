Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 8th.

	Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, today pointed out that ideological and political work in enterprises urgently needs to be strengthened. The purpose of enterprise ideological and political work is to implement the Party's basic line for the primary stage of socialism, build socialism with Chinese characteristics, ease workers' emotions, untie their ideological knots, raise their ideological awareness, and thereby boost the spirits of the broad masses of workers, unite as one, and make contributions to further rectification and deepening of reforms.

	Li Ruihuan made these remarks during a discussion with representatives attending the Beijing-Tianjin-Shanghai Enterprise Ideological and Political Work Seminar.

	He said that due to the severe weakening of ideological and political work in recent years, there are many confused and urgent issues that need to be clarified in people's minds. Due to some mistakes in our work, the masses have some grievances, and we need to do patient and detailed ideological work to build a bridge of communication and understanding between the Party and government and the masses. At the same time, to overcome the economic difficulties we face, we not only need strong rectification measures but also need strong organizational leadership of the Party and in-depth, detailed ideological and political work, as well as effective work results.

	He pointed out that ideological and political work is the Party's "treasure," our political advantage. This political advantage is a set of basic experiences and characteristics that distinguish us from capitalism, formed by the Party over a long period of revolution and construction under the guidance of Marxist theory. The importance of ideological and political work comes from the importance of the masses. The masses are the subjects of practical cognition, the source of wisdom and strength. The masses are the driving force of history, and the process of reform and opening up is the process of the masses creating history. The masses are the masters of a socialist country, and serving the people is the fundamental purpose of our Party. Strengthening enterprise management requires work in many aspects, but the most basic condition is to improve people's quality and give full play to the initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity of the workers.

	When talking about the methods of enterprise ideological and political work, Li Ruihuan said that traditionally, ideological and political work includes: first, conducting universal education in Marxism; second, conducting in-depth and detailed ideological work on the actual problems faced by workers; third, continuously carrying out mass self-education to learn from and catch up with advanced examples; fourth, giving full play to the exemplary and leading role of Party and Youth League members; fifth, carrying out activities that the masses love and enjoy, combining education with entertainment; sixth, incorporating the care for the masses' lives into ideological and political work. These methods are undoubtedly still correct and necessary today. However, we should also see that new situations and problems have emerged. Ideological and political work must not only be strengthened but also adapted. Without adaptation, there can be no strengthening. We should be good at combining traditional methods with the actual situation, continually creating new experiences in ideological and political work.

	Some enterprise secretaries and managers attending the seminar said in their speeches that enterprises are not only the pillars of the state's finances but also the pillars of social stability. Enterprise ideological and political work is closely related to the social climate and should make full use of favorable conditions in society to improve the micro-climate within the enterprise and influence the social climate.

	Wang Renzhi, Minister of the Propaganda Department, also spoke at the opening of the seminar.

    李瑞环同京津沪一研讨会代表座谈时强调
    加强企业思想政治工作振奋职工精神
    要善于把传统方法和现实情况结合创造新经验
    新华社北京11月8日电　（记者吴士深）中共中央政治局常委李瑞环今天在这里指出，当前企业思想政治工作亟待加强。企业思想政治工作的目的就是要贯彻党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线，建设有中国特色的社会主义，理顺职工情绪，解开思想扣子，提高人们的思想觉悟，从而使广大职工精神振奋，团结一致，为进一步治理整顿、深化改革作出贡献。
    李瑞环是在同出席京津沪企业思想政治工作研讨会的代表座谈时说这番话的。
    他说，由于前几年思想政治工作受到严重削弱，在人们思想中存在着许多混乱和亟待澄清的问题；由于我们工作中的一些失误，群众确有些不满情绪，需要我们去做耐心细致的思想工作，在党和政府与人民群众之间架起一条沟通、理解的桥梁。同时，要度过面临的经济上的困难，不但要有强有力的治理整顿措施，而且必须要有强有力的党的组织领导和深入细致的思想政治工作，以及卓有成效的工作成果。
    他指出，思想政治工作是党的“传家宝”，是我们的政治优势。这个政治优势是我们党在长期革命和建设中，在马克思主义理论指导下，逐步形成的一整套区别于资本主义的基本经验和特征。思想政治工作的重要性来源于人民群众的重要性。人民群众是实践认识的主体，是智慧力量的源泉。人民群众是历史的动力，改革开放的过程，就是人民群众创造历史的过程。人民群众是社会主义国家的主人，为人民服务是我们党的根本宗旨。加强企业管理需要做多方面的工作，但最基本的一条是提高人的素质，发挥职工群众的积极性、主动性和创造性。
    在谈到企业思想政治工作的方法时，李瑞环说，从传统上讲，思想政治工作一是进行马克思主义的普遍教育，二是针对职工存在的现实问题，进行深入细致的思想工作，三是经常不断地开展学先进赶先进的群众性自我教育，四是发挥党团员的模范带头作用，五是展开群众喜闻乐见的活动，寓教于乐，六是把关心群众生活纳入到思想政治工作中去。这些方法在今天无疑仍是正确的、需要的。但同时也应当看到，现在也出现了一些新情况、新问题，思想政治工作既要讲加强，也要讲适应，不适应也就谈不上加强。我们应当善于把传统的方法和现实情况密切结合起来，不断创造思想政治工作的新经验。
    参加研讨会的部分企业书记、厂长在发言中认为，企业既是国家财政的支柱，也是稳定大局的支柱。企业的思想政治工作同社会大气候关系密切，应该充分利用社会上的有利条件，把企业的小气候搞好，影响社会大气候。
    中宣部部长王忍之在研讨会开幕时也讲了话。
