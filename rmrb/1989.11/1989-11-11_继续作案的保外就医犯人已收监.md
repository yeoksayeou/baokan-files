Your newspaper published my letter titled "Some Criminals on Medical Parole Continue to Commit Crimes" on the fifth page on February 18. This letter drew the attention of relevant departments at the provincial and municipal levels. The Procuratorate of Chenzhou City, Hunan Province, formed a special investigation team, which, after several months of investigation, has now determined the following:

The criminal Li Zexiong, who was sentenced to nine years in prison for fraud, sought to avoid labor reform in 1987. With the help of a doctor from the Chenzhou Regional Hospital, he obtained a false medical report stating that he had early-stage liver cancer. He also personally altered the blood serum test report and had someone impersonate his supposedly deceased father to apply for medical parole. The provincial juvenile reformatory approved Li Zexiong's medical parole without conducting an investigation and submitted the approval to the provincial reform-through-labor bureau. Li Zexiong, after being granted medical parole, never underwent any treatment. This year in July, the Procuratorate of Chenzhou City sent Li Zexiong to the Chenzhou Regional Hospital for two examinations, and no signs of liver cancer were found.

After being granted medical parole, Li Zexiong engaged in a series of fraudulent and speculative activities. In addition to defrauding the Chenzhou Regional Five-Commerce Store of over 7,000 yuan worth of goods, he defrauded 6,800 yuan in goods payments in early April of last year. After being hired as a general manager by a certain unit, he defrauded 56,600 yuan in goods payments from Jiahe County Guangfa Middle School in August of last year and defrauded over 150,000 yuan in goods payments from a company in Lian County, Guangdong Province, in October of last year. Relevant departments have now re-imprisoned Li Zexiong.

  继续作案的保外就医犯人已收监
  你报2月18日第五版刊登了我写的《一些保外就医犯人仍在继续作案》的来信后，引起了省、地有关部门的重视，湖南郴州市人民检察院组成专案组，历经数月调查，现已查明：
    因诈骗巨款被判刑9年的罪犯黎泽雄，为了逃避劳动改造，于1987年6月通过郴州地区人民医院某医生的帮助，开出了早期肝癌的假病情证明。他还亲自涂改血清检验报告，并让人冒充自己早已死去的父亲，要求保外就医。省少年犯管教所不经调查，签署意见并上报省劳改局，批准了黎泽雄保外就医。黎泽雄保外就医后，从未进行过治疗。今年7月，郴州市人民检察院先后两次押送黎泽雄到郴州地区人民医院检查，均未发现肝癌现象。
    黎泽雄保外就医后，进行了一系列的诈骗和投机倒把犯罪活动。除诈骗郴州地区五交化商场7000多元货物外，去年4月初又诈骗货款6800元。他被某单位聘为总经理后，去年8月诈骗嘉禾县广发中学货款56600元，去年10月诈骗广东连县某公司的货款15万多元。有关部门已将黎泽雄重新收监。
