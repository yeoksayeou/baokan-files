More than 3,000 soldiers from the relief troops and local officials and residents in the earthquake-stricken areas of Datong, Yanggao, Hunyuan, and Guangling have worked tirelessly. The initial phase of disaster relief has been successfully completed. The homeless due to collapsed houses have mostly moved into winter shelters that are earthquake-resistant, cold-resistant, fire-resistant, and rain-resistant.

Since the start of the frost season, the temperature in the Yanbei earthquake zone has dropped to below zero degrees Celsius. The urgent task at hand for the relief work is to address the issues of food and warmth for the disaster victims. The relief troops are helping the affected people to quickly build temporary winter shelters while actively procuring urgently needed items such as cotton clothes and stoves for the disaster victims. So far, nearly 2,000 temporary winter shelters have been set up. The 40,000-plus pieces of cotton and overcoats sent by the Beijing Military Region Logistics Department have also arrived in the disaster areas.

    雁北震区军民救灾初战告捷
    新华社大同11月2日电  （记者赵苏）经过救灾部队3000多名官兵和灾区干部群众的连续奋战，大同、阳高、浑源、广灵4个地震灾区县的救灾工作初战告捷，因房屋震塌无家可归的灾民基本上都住进了防震、防寒、防火、防雨的越冬暖窝。
    进入霜降以来，雁北地震灾区的气温已下降到零下四五摄氏度，救灾工作的当务之急是解决灾民的吃饭和御寒问题。救灾部队一面帮助受灾群众抢搭过冬简易住房，一面积极筹措灾民急需的棉衣、锅灶等物资。到目前为止，已搭起越冬简易住房近2000个。北京军区后勤部支援的4万多件棉衣、大衣也已送到灾区。
