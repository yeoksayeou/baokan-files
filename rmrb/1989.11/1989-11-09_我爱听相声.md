In the realm of traditional Chinese performing arts, I have always been particularly fond of cross-talk. From a young age, I was an avid fan. Seventy years ago, when the famous cross-talk performer "Yun Li Fei" performed at Longfu Temple, I would definitely go to "stand and cheer." If he performed at Tianqiao, I would follow him there. It can be said that cross-talk was an important part of my early education. Of course, because I listened to too much cross-talk, I often played tricks on my teachers in class, and I didn't escape being "punished" (beaten with a ruler).

Cross-talk is akin to satire in literature or caricature in the art world; it is a concise and incisive form of social criticism. Cross-talk can use fluent, natural, and humorous language to make the audience laugh uncontrollably. In the midst of laughter, it sketches out a negative example, presenting a cautionary life lesson, and exposes societal ills in a timely and uncompromising manner.

In the 1950s, when Mr. Ye Shengtao advocated for the purity of the national language, I suggested he listen to some cross-talk. I believe that the language of cross-talk is not only authentic but also lively and full of nuance. I accompanied him to listen to many performances. Mr. Ye was very humorous, and whenever he understood a joke, he would laugh heartily. However, being a Suzhou native, he was not familiar with the Beijing dialect used in cross-talk. For jokes he didn't understand, he would turn to me for an explanation. Once he understood, he would laugh again.

At that time, the "Cross-Talk Festival" was frequently held outside the Qianmen Gate, with performances all afternoon, one after another. It was truly a showcase of various talents. Some cross-talk was lively and straightforward, while others were subtle and profound. In an afternoon, one could listen to ten or more pieces of cross-talk, each with its unique style, but most of them closely aligned with the political and social needs of the time. "Changing Jobs" and "Guan Gong Fights Qin Qiong" exposed the arrogance and tyranny of old military warlords, "Marriage and Superstition" promoted the newly published "Marriage Law," and "Night Travel" complemented the promotion of traffic rules.

Novels are often read just once, but some classic cross-talk pieces, when broadcast multiple times on the radio, still retain their humor. The set of cassette tapes of Hou Baolin's cross-talk that I keep by my bedside is mostly from the 1950s, and they are still enjoyable today. After the fall of the "Gang of Four," Jiang Kun's creation and performance of "Such a Photograph" and "The Farewell of the Conqueror" played a significant role in purging the remnants of the Cultural Revolution. Some cross-talk (like Ma Ji's "Red-Eyed Disease") is similar to the "Broadcasting and Publicizing" program on CCTV: it presents a negative character, making the audience laugh while also reflecting on themselves. Cross-talk is good at using humor to mock and criticize social vices.

Cross-talk is indeed an art of language. In addition to puns, idiomatic expressions, and witty remarks, it also skillfully uses homophones, as seen in "Misinterpreted Three Kingdoms," where "Zhao Zi Long, old and feeble" is changed to "selling steamed buns," and Zhang Fei's mother, whose surname is Wu, is changed to "creating trouble out of nothing." Some cross-talk is full of wit and imagination, such as the dialogue between Confucius and the Buddha in "Eating Tangyuan." "Dream Wedding" reflects the disparity between the rich and the poor. I particularly appreciate those cross-talk pieces that satirize literary and stage styles. "Drama and Dialect," "Art and Life," and others offer insightful comments on poetry and drama from an aesthetic perspective. "Jiu Fuzi" satirizes those who feign profundity. These pieces have been beneficial in improving literary styles.

Cross-talk is also a form of dramatic art, and it is a form of direct performance with a focus on negative characters. Cross-talk performers can imitate anyone, changing their tone, accent, and demeanor at will, portraying various characters from life with remarkable accuracy.

Among all forms of art, cross-talk is one of the most powerful tools for changing customs and habits. It is light and easy, requiring no props or sets, and it combines education with entertainment, making it popular among the masses. Cross-talk's social satire is concise, timely, and sharp. In just twenty to thirty minutes, it can cover a wide range of topics, from family planning to quitting smoking and gambling, either directly promoting or subtly hinting at positive behaviors.

Although cross-talk originated in Beijing and Tianjin, its audience extends to Hong Kong, Singapore, and San Francisco. Cross-talk can also act as a lubricant. After the Cultural Revolution, interpersonal relationships were strained, and many people had unresolved grievances. "Laughing and Crying Destiny" broke through the psychological barriers caused by the decade-long turmoil. Many cross-talk pieces are aimed at the work style of officials. In the 1950s, He Chi's "Buying a Monkey" created the immortal character of Ma Dahua, which played a significant role in combating sloppy work styles. Additionally, "Meeting Addict," "Mine Manager," and "When the New Director Arrives" all strongly criticize bureaucratism. "A Familiar Face" satirizes officials who use their power to arbitrarily label people politically and engage in unbridled corruption and extortion. "Public Medical Care" is also aimed at unethical practices. As for satire related to marriage, there are countless examples. Some cross-talk aims to praise the advanced, such as creating the image of a model salesperson or mail carrier. It not only criticizes the negative but also establishes the positive.

Some cross-talk is educational. I learned a lot about martial arts from the cross-talk "Guardian of the Melon." "Digging for Treasure" vividly introduces the treasures hidden in a pig's body.

Nowadays, every noon, I listen to Beijing Radio's cross-talk broadcasts. Some cross-talk pieces are indeed excellent, with plenty of humor, well-timed punchlines, and sharp satire. However, I must admit that sometimes I am disappointed. Excellent cross-talk starts fresh and naturally. But some pieces often begin with clichés, such as "Cross-talk is an art of language." Since the 1950s, countless cross-talk pieces have started with this sentence. I also dislike farcical openings. For example, one person speaks or sings, while the other deliberately disrupts, relying on mischief to make the audience laugh. Another cheap source of laughter is insults. For example, the ad-libber asks the straight man, "You are Mr. Wang (eight)?" Recently, there are a few cross-talk performers with good voices. Some can sing "Pulling the Net" in Japanese, some imitate Beijing opera's qingyi or lao sheng, and more sing folk songs. Cross-talk emphasizes speaking, imitating, teasing, and singing, with some singing mixed in, which is acceptable. However, I do not like cross-talk that is sung from beginning to end. It would be better to have a solo concert. Acrobatic speaking is a hard skill, requiring a good memory and clear enunciation. Reciting a hundred or so place names or dish names in one breath is indeed a challenging feat, and Hou Baolin's "Selling Cloth Scraps" is a classic example. However, some of these cross-talk pieces are strenuous for the performer, with low humor and a lack of beauty due to being too mechanical. Acrobatic speaking showcases the performer's basic skills but lacks depth in social satire.

Additionally, since cross-talk is an art of language, it should not rely too much on actions, resembling mime. If watching cross-talk on TV, you can see the performers, but on the radio, you can only hear the audience's laughter, which can be confusing. In any case, cross-talk that relies on actions is inferior. It reminds me of the street performances of the old days.

In the 1950s, there were many excellent cross-talk pieces, some exposing the old society, others criticizing contemporary issues. During the ten years of the Cultural Revolution, cross-talk was in decline. Some praising-type cross-talk emerged, which was dull and unnatural, and even less humorous. At that time, satire and caricature were also dormant. Some famous performers like Hou Baolin also suffered greatly, just like other artists.

Since the reform and opening up, everything has flourished, and cross-talk has also prospered. In the early 1980s, cross-talk not only exposed the various ugliness of the ultra-left line but also vented the public's anger and played a role in rectifying social customs. Cross-talk was reborn.

At present, during the country's efforts to rectify and deepen reforms, cross-talk has great potential. Let cross-talk wield its sword of laughter, aiming at corruption, unethical practices, and all negative aspects of life.

At the same time, to promote the creation of cross-talk and improve its artistic level, I suggest that the Federation of Literary and Art Circles hold a seminar for outstanding authors or performers, or even confer honorary titles on famous cross-talk authors or performers.

### 我爱听相声

    我爱听相声
    萧乾
    在曲艺中，我最喜听相声。从小我就是个相声迷。七十年前，京城名相声演员“云里飞”在隆福寺里“说”，我必然去“站脚助威”。他去天桥，我就跟到天桥。可以说，相声是我所受启蒙教育的一个重要部分。当然，小时由于听多了相声，在课堂里净跟老师耍贫嘴，我也没少“吃片儿汤”（挨板子）。
    相声相当于文学方面的杂文或美术界的漫画，都是短小精悍的社会批评。相声能以流畅自然、幽默风趣的语言，把听众逗得笑个不停。在笑声中，勾勒出一个反面教员，呈现出一份警世的生活教材，把社会上的不良现象，及时地并且无情地拿出示众。
    五十年代叶圣陶先生提倡祖国语言纯洁性时，我建议他去听听相声。我认为相声的语言不但地道，而且活泼生动，有余味。我曾陪他听过不少场。叶老很富于幽默感，凡他听懂了的哏，必然朗声大笑。然而他是苏州人，而相声是地道的京津产物。听不懂的，他必侧过脸来向我认真地问个仔细。及至听懂了，他就补笑一番。
    那时，前门外经常举行“相声大会”，整个下午，一场接一场，都是相声。那真是八仙过海，各显其能。有的相声火爆明朗，有的含蓄深沉。一个下午听上十来段相声，风格各有不同，但大多是密切地配合了当时的政治和社会需要。《改行》和《关公战秦琼》控诉了旧时军阀的蛮横跋扈，《婚姻与迷信》宣传了刚刚公布的《婚姻法》，《夜行记》配合宣传了交通规则。
    小说大多看一遍就够了，可有些相声精品，电台播上多遍，至今听了，哏劲不衰。我床畔放的一套录音磁带《侯宝林相声集》，就大多是五十年代的，今天听起来仍很过瘾。“四人帮”倒台后，姜昆创作并演出的《如此照相》和《霸王别姬》，对于肃清“文革”流毒，起过很大作用。有些相声（如马季的《红眼病》），很像中央电视台《广而告之》那个节目：托出一个反面人物，让观众朗笑之余，也各自对照一下。相声善于以笑的手段，针对社会上一些积习流弊，加以嘲弄鞭挞。
    相声确实是一门语言的艺术。除了双关语、歇后语以及随机应变的俏皮话之外，它还善于利用汉语的同音字做文章，如《歪批三国》中把“赵子龙老迈年高》说成“卖年糕”，把张飞母亲姓吴诌成“无事生非”。有些相声充满机智和想象，如《吃元宵》中孔子与如来佛之间的对话。
  《梦中婚》则反映了贫富悬殊。我特别欣赏那些讽刺文风与舞台风的相声。《戏剧与方言》、《艺术与生活》等都从审美的角度，对诗歌戏剧提出中肯意见。《朱夫子》讽刺了故作玄虚者。这些，对于改进文风不无裨益。
    相声又是一门戏剧艺术，而且是现身说法，以反角为主。相声演员学啥人像啥人，随时变换声调、口音、神态，把生活中各种人物，学得惟妙惟肖。
  在所有文艺形式中，相声是移风易俗最有力的工具之一。它轻而易举。不需道具布景，寓教于乐，为群众喜闻乐见。相声的社会讽刺既简短及时又尖锐。在短短的二三十分钟内，从计划生育到戒烟禁赌，都能正面宣传或旁敲侧击。
    相声虽然产于京津，它的听众却远及香港、新加坡和旧金山。相声还能起润滑油的作用。一场“文革”，人际关系受到冲击，很多人心里有解不开的扣子。《啼笑因缘》就冲破了十年浩劫在社会心理上所造成的障碍。不少相声是针对干部作风的。五十年代何迟写的《买猴记》塑造了马大哈这个不朽的形象，在反对马虎作风方面所起的有益作用是非常之大的。此外，《开会迷》、《矿长》、《新局长到来的时候》也都对官僚主义做了有力的抨击。《似曾相识的人》讽刺了干部利用职权在政治上乱给人扣帽子，肆无忌惮地贪污敲诈的恶劣作风。《公费医疗》也是针对不正之风的。至于有关婚姻方面的讽刺，更是不胜枚举。有些相声旨在表扬先进，如塑造模范售货员或邮递员的美好形象。它一方面打击歪的，另一方面也树立正的。
    有些相声是知识型的。我就从相声《倭瓜镖》中得到不少武术方面的常识。《挖宝》生动地介绍了猪身上的宝藏。
    现在每天中午，我必听北京电台播出的相声。有些相声的确精采，笑料足，包袱抖得响，讽刺深刻。然而不能不承认，有时听了却使我失望。精采的相声，开头既新鲜又自然。但有些段子常用套话开头，例如“相声是一门语言的艺术”。从五十年代以来，不知多少相声都用这句话开头。我也很不喜欢闹剧式的开头。例如一个说或唱，另一个故意起哄捣乱，靠恶作剧来引观众发笑。另外一种廉价的笑料就是靠骂。例如逗方问捧方：“您姓王吧（八）。”近来相声界颇有几位嗓子好的，有的能用日语唱《拉网小调》，有的学京剧的青衣或老生，更多的是唱民歌的。相声讲究说学逗唱，夹一些唱是可以的，然而我不大喜欢那种从头唱到尾的相声。那就不如请你开个独唱会。贯口是硬功夫，说起来得记性强，口齿清，一口气背上百十来个地名或菜名，确实是重头活，真本事。侯宝林的《卖布头》，赔本赚吆喝，人人爱听。然而有些这类相声，说的人吃力，哏度既不高，由于太机械化了些，有时还缺乏美感。贯口表现相声演员的基本功有余，在内容上，作为社会讽刺则不足。
    另外，相声是以语言的艺术为性，就不能过多地靠动作，类乎哑剧。如果听电视上的相声，还可以看到，在广播中就只能听到观众的笑声，不免感到茫然。无论如何，靠动作的相声总是低一筹的。它使人想到早年庙会上演的那种文明戏。
    五十年代曾有过不少精采的相声，有控诉旧社会的，也有针砭时弊的。“文革”那十年，相声就很不景气。一些歌颂型的相声应运而生，听了枯燥乏味，很不自然，更不哏。那时杂文和漫画也在冬眠。有些名演员如侯宝林，也和其他文艺工作者一样，受尽折磨。
    改革开放以来，各方面欣欣向荣，相声也随之昌盛起来。八十年代初期，相声不但揭露了极左路线的种种丑态，还为大家出了气，也在端正社会风气上起了作用。相声又获得了新生。
    当前，在国家狠抓治理整顿、深化改革之际，相声应大有可为。让相声挥动它那笑的利剑，刺向贪污腐化，刺向不正之风，刺向生活中的一切消极现象。
    同时，为了繁荣相声的创作，提高相声的艺术水平，建议曲协为成绩突出的作者或演员开开研讨会，甚至颁给著名相声作者或演员荣誉称号。
