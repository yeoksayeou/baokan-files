The highly anticipated fifth FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup is nearing its conclusion. Experts in volleyball believe that the results of the past five rounds have not been surprising. The Cuban team has shown superior skills, and by the halfway point of the tournament, they had already defeated several strong opponents, making it almost certain that they would win the gold medal. The focus of interest here has naturally shifted to the still-uncertain allocation of the silver and bronze medals.

China's last two matches will be against the Soviet Union and Japan. The Soviet Union team stated that after winning the gold medal at the Olympics last year, their players have undergone changes, and their strength has somewhat declined. However, careful observers notice that while the Soviet team has new players, the core lineup remains the same. The Chinese team should not underestimate the Soviet team just because they lost badly to Cuba. In fact, key players like Semenova and Chebukina of the Soviet team have maintained their original level of performance, and they will surely give their all when facing the Chinese women's volleyball team.

The Japanese women's team's outstanding performance in this tournament is indeed impressive, and they show a trend of improving with each match. In the game against Cuba on November 11, Japan took the lead in the first half of all three sets, and in the third set, they even led 13-6 at one point. Although they eventually lost to Cuba, it can be seen that the Japanese women's team not only has excellent defense but also improved attacking capabilities. On November 12, Saito Mayumi's spikes repeatedly broke through Cuba's defensive wall. Even Cuba's Luis said that they least wanted to face a tenacious team like Japan.

The Chinese women's volleyball team has a lower average height compared to the Soviet team and weaker attacking power. How the Chinese team can utilize their all-around technical strengths and use speed to counter height will be the key to victory. Generally speaking, for the Chinese women's volleyball team, playing against Japan might be slightly easier than playing against the Soviet Union.

    鸣金前的两场硬仗
    ——中国女排能夺银牌吗
    引人瞩目的第五届世界杯女排赛接近尾声。排球行家认为，过去的五轮比赛的结果并没有出乎人们预料。古巴队技高一筹，赛程过半时，便打败几个强硬对手，说金牌在握并不过言。此间人士的兴趣自然转向至今仍不明朗的银牌和铜牌的归属问题上来了。
    中国队最后两场比赛对手分别是苏联队和日本队。苏联队称，去年奥运会夺冠军后，队员新陈代谢，实力有所下降。然而细心者看出，苏联队中确有新人，但主力阵容仍是原班人马。对中国队来说，不能因为苏联队惨败给古巴队而掉以轻心。事实上，苏联队主力队员谢苗诺娃、切布金娜基本保持原有水平，与中国女排对阵，她们必将全力以赴。
    日本女队在本届比赛中的超水平发挥，确实令人刮目相看，并有越打越好的势头。11日与古巴队的比赛，三局的前半程日本队都先声夺人，第三局竟一度以13∶6领先，虽然最后负于古巴队，但可看到，日本女排不仅防守依然出色，进攻能力也有提高。12号斋藤真由美的扣球多次突破古巴队的人墙。以至古巴的路易斯说，最不愿意与日本队这种顽强类型的队伍交手。
    中国女排平均高度低于苏联队，强攻能力比对方弱，中国女排如何发挥自己技术全面的特长，以快制高，是能否取胜的关键。一般认为，对中国女排来说，打日本队比打苏联队容易一些。
