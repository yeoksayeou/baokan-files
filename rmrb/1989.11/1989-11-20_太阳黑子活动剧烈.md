According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, solar flare activity has intensified this year and may reach record levels by the end of the year, posing threats to radio wave transmission, satellites, and even power systems.

This solar flare cycle began in 1986 and is expected to peak by the end of this year or early next year. Solar activity varies in strength over an 11-year cycle, with the peak of each cycle typically seeing an average of 120 sunspots. Sunspots are dark spots on the solar photosphere, with temperatures about 1,500 degrees Celsius lower than the surrounding photosphere, appearing as dark spots in comparison. Currently, this cycle is still a few months away from its peak, yet the average number of sunspots has already reached 130. Scientists believe that solar flare activity will continue to increase, potentially reaching the highest levels observed in previous cycles. The peak in 1958 saw an average of 201.3 sunspots. Scientists are still unsure what causes solar activity to intensify from one cycle to the next.

Solar activity manifests not only as sunspots but also as faculae, solar flares, and other phenomena. Solar flares emit streams of particle radiation. When these streams are directed towards Earth, they can have serious impacts. Radiation pulses can interfere with radio wave transmission, including radar and satellite communications. Power generation and grid systems can also be affected. The radiation can cause the atmosphere to heat up and expand, increasing drag on satellites and potentially causing them to deorbit prematurely. The increase in solar activity this year has already led to numerous auroras and other significant impacts. In March, a solar flare caused a power outage in Canada, leaving 9 million people in Quebec without electricity, and some satellites were affected. In mid-August, the Wilhelm-Foerster Observatory in West Berlin observed a powerful solar explosion, equivalent to the energy of thousands of hydrogen bombs; the Beijing Astronomical Observatory recorded a strong solar microwave radio burst, which disrupted shortwave radio communications. On October 19, U.S. scientists observed a massive solar flare on the sun's surface. German space research experts believe that a giant sunspot, measuring 340,000 kilometers in length and 40,000 kilometers in width, has formed on the sun, releasing enormous energy into space and radiating large amounts of X-rays, radio waves, and ultraviolet light that pose cancer risks to the Earth's surface.

Solar activity also has its benefits. Scientists have long been concerned about the depletion of ozone and the increase in ultraviolet radiation. Increased solar activity can help generate ozone in the upper atmosphere. The ozone layer protects the Earth from harmful radiation.

    太阳黑子活动剧烈
    据美国海洋和大气管理署预报，今年的太阳黑子活动加剧，到年底时可能达到创纪录水平，并会威胁无线电波传送、卫星甚至电力系统。
    这次太阳黑子活动周期开始于一九八六年，在今年底、明年初有可能达到高峰。太阳活动的强与弱以十一年为一个周期，周期高峰时太阳黑子平均数一般都会达到一百二十个。太阳黑子是太阳光球层上出现的斑点，温度比光球低一千五百摄氏度左右，和光球相比就成为暗淡的黑点。目前的这次周期离高峰还有几个月，而太阳黑子的平均数已到一百三十个。科学家认为，太阳黑子的活动还会继续增加，动量有可能达到过去活动周期的顶峰。一九五八年的高峰平均数为二百零一点三个黑子。科学家们也不清楚究竟是什么原因使得太阳活动一个周期比一个周期更剧烈。
    太阳活动除表现为黑子外，还表现为光斑、耀斑等现象。太阳耀斑放射出一股股粒子辐射线，当它们朝着地球的方向时，就会对地球产生严重影响。射线脉冲会干扰无线电波的传送，包括干扰雷达与卫星通讯，发电及电力网络系统也会受到影响。射线还会使大气层温度上升，使之膨胀，由此产生的阻力可能使卫星减速，并导致卫星比原计划提前坠落地面。今年太阳活动的增加，已经造成了大量极光的出现和其他严重影响。三月的一次太阳耀斑造成加拿大停电，魁北克省九百万人突然失去了电源供应，一些卫星受到干扰。八月中旬，西柏林威廉—弗尔斯特天文台观测到了太阳的一次强烈爆炸，其能量相当于几千枚氢弹爆炸；北京天文台观测记录了一次强烈的太阳微波射电爆发，这次爆发导致了短波无线电通讯的中断。十月十九日，美国科学家观测到太阳表面出现巨大的耀斑。联邦德国太空研究专家认为，现在太阳上形成了长三十四万公里、宽四万公里的巨大黑子，它向宇宙释放巨大能量，并向地面辐射大量X射线、无线电波和有致癌危险的紫外线光。
    太阳活动也有有利的一面。科学家们一直担心臭氧的减少而紫外线辐射的增加，可以帮助大气上层中臭氧的生成。臭氧层可以保护地球免遭有害射线的破坏。
