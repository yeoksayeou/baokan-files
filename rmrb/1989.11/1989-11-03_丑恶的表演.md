Recently, the fugitive criminal Jiang Jieqi and his ilk, who have fled abroad, have stolen the masthead of the People's Daily to publish the infamous "Minzhan" initiative, and even forged the overseas edition of the People's Daily. They have spread a pile of trash that maliciously attacks the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the socialist system, defames our efforts to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and slanders the stable and united political situation in China since the suppression of the rebellion. This trash has been transmitted into China via fax machines. On October 24, the overseas edition of the People's Daily published an editorial article exposing their clumsy tricks of forging the People's Daily overseas edition, pointing out that they have reached the point of "exhausting all their tricks." Now, they are using modern information technology to peddle these forgeries within China and even holding press conferences and banquets, claiming this is their "first battle" against the Chinese government, quite self-satisfied.

What effect does this "battle" have? It is quite pathetic. It does not harm the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, or the socialist system in the slightest. It cannot add any luster to the already suppressed counter-revolutionary rebellion, nor can it disrupt the stable and united political situation in China since the suppression. On the contrary, it only further exposes who they really are, helping the broad masses of people in China to see more clearly and be more vigilant. They are merely "lifting a rock to drop on their own feet." Whether forging the overseas edition of the People's Daily or using modern information technology, it will not help these fugitive elements. Their reactionary proposals will only find an even smaller market in China.

For many years, Jiang Jieqi and his ilk, who have advocated and insisted on bourgeois liberalization, have been defeated in their attempts to plan, organize, and direct the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in China. Fleeing abroad, they are not giving up, gathering organizations, issuing declarations, making connections, and begging for support, hoping one day to return and realize their dreams that have been shattered by the iron fist of people's democratic dictatorship. We must warn these people: your evil purposes were not achieved in the past and will not be achieved in the future; you cannot cause trouble in China, and running abroad to do various tricks will not help you either. Any attempt to overthrow our People's Republic is nothing but "a tiny ant trying to shake a big tree, laughable and presumptuous"!

We also advise the relevant authorities of other countries to take effective measures to prohibit Chinese fugitives from engaging in any activities against the Chinese government on your soil!

    丑恶的表演
    本报评论员
    最近，叛逃国外的通缉犯严家其之流盗用《人民日报》报头，刊登臭名昭著的“民阵”倡议书，甚至伪造《人民日报》海外版，把他们恶毒攻击中国共产党、中国政府和社会主义制度，诋毁我制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱，肆意诬蔑平暴以来我国安定团结政治局面的一大堆文字垃圾，通过传真机向中国境内传送。10月24日本报海外版曾发表评论员文章，揭露他们伪造《人民日报》海外版的拙劣伎俩，指明他们已经到了“黔驴技穷”的地步。如今，他们又以现代信息技术手段，往国内兜售这类伪造品，还公然举行记者招待会和酒会，声称这是他们反对中国政府的“第一战役”，颇有些自鸣得意。
    这一“战役”究竟有什么效果呢？很可怜，既无损于中国人民、中国共产党、中国政府和社会主义制度的一根毫毛，也不能为已被平息的反革命暴乱增添半分光彩，更搅不乱平暴以来我国安定团结的政治局面。相反，只不过更加彻底地暴露了他们是一伙什么人，使国内广大人民群众进一步擦亮眼睛，提高警惕。他们只能是“搬起石头砸自己的脚”。伪造《人民日报》海外版也罢，借助现代信息技术也罢，都帮不了这些叛逃分子的忙。他们那套反动主张在国内的市场，只会变得更小。
    多年来鼓吹和坚持资产阶级自由化的严家其之流，在国内策划、组织、指挥动乱和反革命暴乱遭到惨败后，逃到国外，贼心不死，拼凑组织，发表宣言，四处串连，八方乞讨，妄图有朝一日卷土重来，实现他们已被人民民主专政的铁拳打得粉碎的迷梦。我们要正告这伙人：你们的罪恶目的过去达不到，今后也达不到；在国内捣乱达不到，跑到国外去搞一些这样那样的名堂也达不到。任何企图颠覆我们人民共和国的伎俩，都不过是“蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量”！
    我们也要奉劝有关国家当局，采取切实措施，禁止中国外逃分子在你们的领土上进行任何反对中国政府的活动！
