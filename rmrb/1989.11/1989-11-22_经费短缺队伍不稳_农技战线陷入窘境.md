Title: Funding Shortages and Instability in the Ranks: The Agricultural Technology Front Faces a Dilemma

Recently, I conducted an investigation into the agricultural technology front in the four counties (districts) of Linqu, Changle, Fangzi, and Changyi in Weifang City. I discovered several concerning issues.

In recent years, the funds allocated by the state to the agricultural technology departments have been decreasing annually. Township agricultural technology stations often rely on selling seeds, pesticides, and other means to obtain funds. In Linqu County, only one out of 28 township agricultural technology stations has the conditions to carry out normal business operations; the agricultural technology system in Fangzi District cannot even find a single microscope. Due to a lack of funds, it is impossible to conduct seed comparison experiments, making the introduction of high-quality seeds highly speculative. Without soil testing, it is difficult to effectively prevent and control pests and diseases and provide scientific guidance for farming.

Base-level agricultural technology stations are severely short-staffed. The agricultural technology station in Changle County has only four people, while Linqu County has only two. Most township agricultural technology stations have only one or two people, making it difficult to handle daily affairs and even harder to conduct scientific research. The reasons for this situation include low pay, harsh living conditions, and difficulties in pursuing a career, leading many graduates from agricultural colleges to change professions. Additionally, most township agricultural technicians are used as administrative officials, making their professional work a "side job." In one county, out of 67 agricultural technology personnel, only two or three are engaged in professional work.

The role of township agricultural technology stations has weakened, and village-level agricultural technology organizations have dissolved, leading to a fragmented agricultural technology promotion network at the county, township, and village levels. This has had a serious impact on agricultural production:

The agricultural technology promotion cycle has been extended. After the land was contracted to households, decentralized management was implemented. If farmers have reservations about adopting new technologies, others cannot interfere. The difficulty in promoting watermelon grafting technology in Changle County is a good example. The bacteria that cause watermelon wilt can survive in the soil for six or seven years, so the watermelon rotation period should be more than eight years. The solution to this problem internationally is often grafting. This technology was mastered and actively promoted by Changle County's scientific and technological personnel as early as 1979. However, by 1987, only 250 plants had been grafted. This year, this technology was finally accepted by a few farmers.

The scope of agricultural technology promotion has narrowed. Currently, the agricultural technology department supports technological leaders to achieve the integration of technology and production, achieving some effects. However, the promotion scope is small, making it difficult for new technologies to be quickly accepted by the majority of farmers.

The ability to resist natural disasters has decreased. Now, farmers rely on their limited agricultural technology knowledge and habits to engage in production. When encountering pests and diseases, they often cannot cope.

The dilemma on the agricultural technology front has become a factor constraining the development of agricultural production. I hope this will draw the attention of relevant departments.

### 经费短缺队伍不稳　农技战线陷入窘境

　　经费短缺队伍不稳
　　农技战线陷入窘境
    最近，我对潍坊市临朐、昌乐、坊子、昌邑四县（区）的农技战线作了调查，发现不少情况令人担忧。
    近几年，国家拨给农技部门的经费逐年减少。乡镇农技站多是用卖种子、农药等手段来获取经费。临朐县28个乡镇农技站只有1个有条件开展正常业务；坊子区农技系统竟找不到一架显微镜。由于资金短缺，无法做种子对比实验，良种引进就具有很大的盲目性；无法进行土壤化验，难以进行有效的病虫害防治和科学种田指导。
    基层农技站深受人手短缺之苦。昌乐县农技站有4人，临朐县农技站只有两人，乡镇农技站多数为一二人，应付日常事务都很紧张，很难开展科研工作。造成这种状况的原因，一是待遇低、生活苦、搞事业难等诸多因素，许多农学院校毕业生纷纷改行；二是多数乡镇农技员被当作行政干部使用，本职工作反而成了“副业”。有一个县67个农技人员中只有两三个人从事业务工作。
    乡镇农技站作用削弱，村级农技组织纷纷解体，致使县、乡、村三级农技推广网络支离破碎，给农业生产带来了严重影响：
    农技推广周期延长。土地承包到户后，实行的是分散经营，农民如果对接受新技术有顾虑，别人无法干涉。昌乐县推广西瓜嫁接技术难就是很好的一例。西瓜枯萎病的病菌在土壤中可存活六七年，因此西瓜轮作期要8年以上。解决这一难题，国际上常用办法是嫁接。这一技术，昌乐县科技人员在1979年就已掌握并大力推广。但到1987年仅嫁接250株。今年，这项技术才被少数农户接受。
    农技推广范围缩小。现在，农技部门通过扶持科技带头户来实现技术同生产的结合，收到一定效果。但推广面小，使新技术难以很快为大多数农民接受。
    抵御自然灾害的能力降低。现在，农民只是凭一知半解的农技知识和习惯从事生产，遇上病虫害，常常无法应付。
    农技战线的窘境，成了制约农业生产发展的因素之一，希望引起有关部门重视。
