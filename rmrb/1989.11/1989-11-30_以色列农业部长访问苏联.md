The Israeli Agriculture Minister visited the Soviet Union on the 28th for an informal visit. This is the first time in 22 years since the two countries severed diplomatic ties that an Israeli cabinet member has visited the Soviet Union.

It was also reported that the original plan for Israeli Labor Party leader Peres to visit the Soviet Union has been postponed, but it is still scheduled to take place before the end of the year.

Meanwhile, during Peres' visit to Poland, a Polish government spokesperson announced that Poland will follow Hungary in resuming formal diplomatic relations with Israel in the first quarter of next year.
