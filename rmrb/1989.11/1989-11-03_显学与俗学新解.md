Title: A New Interpretation of Scholarship and Popular Learning

	Mr. Qian Zhongshu once said, “Generally, scholarship is cultivated by a few sincere individuals in a secluded house by a wild river, far from the bustling market. Scholarship that becomes popular in the marketplace is bound to become vulgar.” This is a profound statement from someone who truly loves scholarship and has no worldly ambitions. Unfortunately, we do not live in ancient times. Printing and paper are both very convenient now. A truly valuable work does not need to be hidden in famous mountains; it will already have found appreciative readers who will reveal it to the world. Even if the author himself ceases to write, among his few sincere friends, there will surely be someone who cannot bear to see the pearls scattered by the wind and will record them on paper (as with the *Analects*), thus ensuring that the work will spread among people and become a revered “scholarship.” Therefore, what is detestable is not “scholarship” but “vulgar learning.” What is “vulgar learning”? In my understanding, it is “scholarship” that has been vulgarized. Perhaps in many countries around the world, there have been such situations: whenever a new theory or a profound and comprehensive masterpiece appears, scholars in that country flock to it, eagerly studying and discussing it, then writing articles to express their own views. Due to differences in individual abilities, some delve deeply and grasp the essence, aligning with the author’s intentions, while others only skim the surface, even filling their writings with misunderstandings and misinterpretations, distorting the original work and turning “scholarship” into “vulgar learning.” However, we cannot throw out the baby with the bathwater and abandon “scholarship” just because we fear the emergence of “vulgar learning.” The publication of *Guanzhai Bian* is now ten years old. (Taiwan also published a series of books, *Seven Works by Qian Zhongshu*.) Over the past ten years, both domestic and international responses to this book have been quite enthusiastic. Everyone has a common understanding that, in terms of its rich content (covering both ancient and modern) and innovative methods (bridging Chinese and Western cultures), this is unprecedented. Additionally, there are many other writing and stylistic features that are difficult to enumerate. Up to now, the articles introducing this book seem to still be at the stage of general recommendation, without delving into its truly profound aspects. Therefore, the author’s true face is still somewhat obscured. If this continues, the once-famous *Guanzhai Bian* may also degenerate into what Mr. Qian calls “vulgar learning.”

	To avoid this fate, I suggest that in the future, our research on Qian’s works (including *Guanzhai Bian* and other monographs and essays) should not merely consist of general commentary but should take the form of specialized topics. That is, each article should discuss only one problem, striving for depth and alignment with the author’s original intent, while also offering the researcher’s own insights. This approach is naturally more challenging, but it will undoubtedly help both the researcher and the reader to gain a deeper understanding of Qian’s works. It is worth a try.

    显学与俗学新解
    郑朝宗
    钱钟书先生说过：“大抵学问是荒江野老屋中二三素心人商量培养之事，朝市之显学必成俗学。”这是真正爱好学问不存一点俗念者的高论。无奈目前非上古时代，印刷及纸张均极方便，一部真有价值的著作不待藏诸名山，早已有知音者揭而出之，以昭示世人。退一万步说，即使作者本人断绝文字缘，单凭妙舌传道，其二三素心的朋友中亦必有人不忍珠玉随风飘散、归而笔之于纸者（如《论语》是），仍不免出荒江野屋而流传于人间，成为众所瞻仰的“显学”。所以，可厌的不是“显学”而是“俗学”。什么叫作“俗学”？依我的理解，就是庸俗化了的“显学”。大概世界上许多国家都有过这样的情况，每当一种新学说或一部体大思精的巨著出现时，其国之学者群趋若鹜，争相研诵，然后著为文章，各抒己见，由于各人水平不同，其高者探骊得珠，与作者意会神合，其低者则仅得皮毛，甚至充满误解曲解，使原作面目全非，把“显学”变为“俗学”的正是后面一种人。然而，我们决不能因噎废食，为了怕出现“俗学”便把“显学”束之高阁。《管锥编》的问世到现在已历十年。（台湾亦出版系列书《钱著七种》）十年来国内外对此书的反响相当热烈，大家有个共同的认识，即从内容的丰富（涵盖古今）与方法的新颖（沟通中外）来看，这是前所未有的。此外，尚有许多写作及其他方面的特点难以备述。直到现在为止，关于此书的评介文章似乎还停留在一般推荐的阶段上，没有触及真正深微之处，因此其作者的真面目还若隐若现。倘任其继续下去，则名噪一时的《管锥编》也有可能沦为钱先生所说的“俗学”。
    为了避免这种厄运，我建议今后我们对钱著（包括《管锥编》以外的其他专书和论文）的研究，不再作一般的评述，而以专题的形式出现，即一篇文章只谈一个问题，力求深透和符合作者的本意，又有研究者的创见。这样做自然难度更大，但毕竟有助于使自己及读者更进一步了解钱著，不妨试试。
