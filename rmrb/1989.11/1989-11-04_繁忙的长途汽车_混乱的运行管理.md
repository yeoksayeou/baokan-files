	Busy Long-Distance Buses: Chaotic Management
	With the increase in railway ticket prices, a portion of passengers have shifted to road transportation. Based on several years of experience and investigation, I believe that to ensure that road transportation can handle the increasingly heavy passenger tasks, it is necessary to thoroughly rectify the widespread chaotic conditions in road passenger transport.

	Drivers secretly carry passengers for extra money. This has been a common problem in road passenger transport in recent years. Recently, during a journey of less than 100 kilometers, I saw the driver secretly charge and carry more than 20 passengers.

	Poor vehicle maintenance leads to frequent breakdowns. Just take the two incidents I encountered recently as examples. Once, a car that was already broken down was not known to anyone, and it was only discovered when it was time to start the journey. It took over an hour to repair, but it still couldn't be fixed, so a replacement car had to be used. Another time, during night driving when the headlights were needed, the driver discovered that a pair of headlights were out, so he had to honk the horn continuously and slowly crawl along the side of the road.

	Starting and stopping at will according to the driver's convenience. Some drivers, when they encounter items they need on the way, will haggle and buy some, or chat with acquaintances for 10 or 20 minutes without any concern for time. Some passengers miss their connections due to delays, and although they complain bitterly, they can only endure it in silence.

	Disorder and poor hygiene. Many stations, schedules, times, and stops are not announced in advance, ticket checking is not done in order, and boarding is not done in order. From some stations, waiting rooms to the carriages and seats, fruit peels, paper scraps, garbage, and dust can be seen everywhere.

	Road passenger transport affects thousands of households and the entire society. If the above problems are not properly solved, it will not only be difficult to complete the passenger transport tasks but also easily cause dissatisfaction among the people, which is indeed not to be taken lightly.

    繁忙的长途汽车  混乱的运行管理
    随着铁路客票的涨价，一部分客源转向了公路。根据几年来的体验和调查，我认为，要保证公路完成更加繁重的客运任务，必须彻底整顿公路客运中普遍存在的混乱状况。
    司机私自带客捞外块。这是近年来公路客运存在的一个“通病”。近日我在不足100公里的乘车途中，就看到司机私收费带客20多人。
    客车保养不善故障多。仅以我近期遇到的两例为证。一次是本来就是开不动的坏车却无人知晓，到了开车时才发现，修理了一个多小时也没修好，只好换车。另一次是晚间行车需开灯时，司机才发现两个车灯瞎了一对，于是只得喇叭长鸣沿路边慢慢滑行。
    要开要停随司机的便。有的驾驶员途中碰到需要的物品讨价还价买一点，遇到熟人寒暄几句，停个10分、20分钟毫不在乎，头脑中根本没有时间观念。有的乘客转车误了点，虽叫苦不迭，但也只能忍气吞声。
    秩序混乱卫生差。许多车站、车次、时间、停靠站预先不通报，检票不按号，上车不对号。从一些车站、候车室到车厢、座位，果皮、纸屑、垃圾、灰尘到处可见。
    公路客运关系千家万户，影响全社会，上述问题如不很好解决，既使客运任务难以完成，又容易引起人民群众的不满情绪，实在不可小视。
