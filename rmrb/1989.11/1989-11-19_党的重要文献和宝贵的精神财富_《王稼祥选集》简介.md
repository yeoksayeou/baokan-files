Wang Jiaxiang (1906–1974) was a great Marxist and an outstanding proletarian revolutionary. The Selected Works of Wang Jiaxiang includes documents starting from 1926 to 1962, totaling 60 pieces, of which 41 have not been published before. Throughout his half-century of revolutionary struggle, Wang Jiaxiang was adept at summarizing experiences and lessons, making theoretical generalizations, and leaving behind many works. The works included in the Selected Works cover his important writings on military political work, party building, ideological and theoretical work, the anti-Japanese national united front, the party's foreign liaison work, and international issues. His theoretical contributions are part of the collective wisdom of the Communist Party of China.

Among the leaders who have served as the director of the General Political Department of our army during the revolutionary war years, Wang Jiaxiang has the longest cumulative term. The Selected Works of Wang Jiaxiang includes a relatively concentrated collection of writings on the political work of the Red Army, totaling 18 pieces, systematically expounding the experiences, principles, and requirements of Red Army political work construction. These writings embody Wang Jiaxiang's achievements and wisdom in the construction of Red Army political work.

"Political Work is the Lifeline of Our Red Army" is Wang Jiaxiang's opening speech at the First National Political Work Conference of the Red Army. At this conference, he, along with Zhu De and Zhou Enlai, systematically summarized past practical experiences and clearly proposed the famous proposition that "political work is the lifeline of the Red Army," elevating the importance of Red Army political work to a very accurate height. This is a thought with far-reaching significance. Wang Jiaxiang pointed out: "All wars, if not guaranteed by political work, cannot achieve their missions. The purpose of our Red Army's struggle is to liberate workers and peasants, and political work is to enhance the initiative of Red Army soldiers and the masses of workers and peasants. Political work is the driving force to enhance the combat effectiveness of the Red Army."

Wang Jiaxiang's outstanding contributions to two crucial conferences in party history—the Zunyi Conference and the Sixth Plenum of the Sixth Central Committee—are well-known. "Resolutely and Swiftly March North to Establish the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Base Area" and "After Moving North, We Should Develop East of the Tuo River" are speeches made during the Long March in the Central Political Bureau meeting after the Zunyi Conference, which played a significant role in supporting Mao Zedong's correct military line and resisting Zhang Guotao's erroneous proposals. "Report on International Instructions" is the outline of Wang Jiaxiang's report transmitting the instructions of the Communist International. He pointed out that the Communist International affirmed the line of the Communist Party of China, "believing that the CPC has established an anti-Japanese united front in the past year, and especially that Zhu, Mao, and others have led the Eighth Route Army to implement the party's new policies. The international community believes that the political line of the CPC is correct, and the CPC has truly applied Marxism-Leninism in complex environments and difficult conditions." "In the leading organs, problems should be solved under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, and there should be a close and united atmosphere in the leading organs." This report played a significant role in maintaining the correct line and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Mao Zedong.

The article "On the Three Principles of the People and Communism" comprehensively discusses the similarities and differences between the Three Principles of the People and Communism, scientifically explaining that the Three Principles of the People can and should become the common program and political basis for the anti-Japanese national united front and cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. At the same time, it points out that Chinese Communists acknowledge the Three Principles of the People as a common program, struggle for the thorough realization of the Three Principles of the People, but will never, for any reason, temporarily abandon the ideal of communism and the theory of Marxism-Leninism.

The articles "On Several Issues of Strengthening the Party," "Decision of the Central Political Bureau on Strengthening the Party," and "Struggle for the Strengthening and Consolidation of the Communist Party of China" concentrate on proposing important views and opinions on building and consolidating the party in the new historical period of the national anti-Japanese war. Wang Jiaxiang's basic view is: the quality and level of the party should not be lowered for the quantity of party members. He believes: the core of strengthening the party is to strengthen party education; party discipline should not be relaxed due to the policy of the national united front, but rather, because of the united front environment, party discipline should be strictly maintained; insisting on correctly carrying out ideological struggle is the key to consolidating the party's ideological unity and party unity; establishing a harmonious relationship of mutual learning and mutual respect between old and new cadres is of great importance to consolidating the party.

The article "The Communist Party of China and Revolutionary War" summarizes the basic experience of the party leading revolutionary war and revolutionary army, explaining the party's gradual recognition of the importance and characteristics of revolutionary war in its development process, and analyzing the correct military theory and practice represented by Mao Zedong. Wang Jiaxiang particularly emphasizes the importance of knowledge to the revolutionary army, proposing to be armed with rich military, political, and cultural knowledge. This is a strategic proposal with far-reaching significance for the construction of our army.

"The Political Bureau Should Take Ideological Leadership as the Center" is part of Wang Jiaxiang's speech at the enlarged meeting of the Central Political Bureau in September 1941. He said: "The past ideological methodology of the Chinese Party has been opposed by mechanical materialism, metaphysics, and dialectical materialism. Comrade Mao Zedong represents dialectical materialism, and in the white areas, Comrade Liu Shaoqi represents dialectical materialism." The article "The Communist Party of China and the Road to National Liberation of China" is a outstanding achievement of Wang Jiaxiang's participation in the rectification study and summarization of the party's historical experience. This famous article first proposed the scientific concept of Mao Zedong Thought, explaining the historical process of the formation and development of Mao Zedong Thought. It points out: "The correct road of the entire process of national liberation of China—past, present, and future—is the thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, that is, the road pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong in his writings and practice. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of China, the Bolshevism of China, and the Communism of China." He also emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought "is the result of the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the actual experience of the Chinese revolutionary movement," and "this theory is also continuing to develop."

The Selected Works of Wang Jiaxiang includes 27 articles from the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan. These articles played an important role in enriching the theoretical thought of the new democratic revolution and made outstanding contributions to the relatively complete formation of the collective wisdom of the party, Mao Zedong Thought.

The "Outline of Urban Work" written in June 1948, based on the actual situation of the Northeast liberated area, especially the practical experience of taking over Harbin, discusses the importance of urban work and focuses on issues such as relying on the working class, concentrating efforts on restoring and developing urban production, protecting national industry and commerce, and democratizing the government. It proposes a series of policies and principles for urban work, many of which have far-sighted theoretical views.

The 8 articles included in the Selected Works after the founding of the People's Republic reflect Wang Jiaxiang's important views on the party's foreign liaison work and international issues. "Opening Speech at the Central International Activities Conference" is an initial summary of China's civilian international activities in the early days of the founding of the People's Republic, emphasizing the importance of international activities work. "Insist on the Principle of Equality in Party Relations" points out that the relationship between Marxist-Leninist parties must be based on the principle of equality, and when problems arise in the relationship, the policy of "more self-criticism, less criticism of others" should be adopted. "Decide on Policies Based on the Situation of One's Own Country" points out that the situations of various countries are different, and the experience of other countries can only be used as a reference and cannot be copied. Policies must be based on the actual situation of one's own country.

Particularly noteworthy are the two articles written in the first half of 1962. "Seek Truth from Facts, Act According to One's Ability" explains the important principles of foreign aid, stating that aid is necessary, but it must be based on facts and act according to one's ability. Especially when the country is in a period of economic difficulty, "one must be more cautious and not overstate or overdo things." "A Brief Discussion on Some Views on International Issues" systematically expounds views and opinions on international issues, and in response to the debates in the international communist movement and the "leftist" views within our party at that time, puts forward unique views. However, Wang Jiaxiang's correct views and proposals were wrongly criticized as the "three reconciliations and one reduction" revisionist line. After the start of the Cultural Revolution, he was further slandered by the conspirator Kang Sheng as the "three surrenders and one annihilation" counter-revolutionary revisionist line and subjected to severe criticism. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Central Committee issued a notice to rehabilitate him. After historical verification, Wang Jiaxiang's works, when read today, still provide valuable insights.

    党的重要文献和宝贵的精神财富
    ——《王稼祥选集》简介
    王稼祥（1906—1974）是伟大的马克思主义者和杰出的无产阶级革命家。《王稼祥选集》收入的文稿，起自1926年，止于1962年，全书共60篇，其中有41篇过去未公开发表过。王稼祥在半个世纪革命斗争中，善于总结经验教训，作出理论概括，留下了很多著作。收入《选集》的是他在军队政治工作、党的建设、思想理论工作、抗日民族统一战线、党的对外联络工作和国际问题等方面的重要论著。他的思想理论贡献，是中国共产党集体智慧结晶的一部分。
    在革命战争年代担任过我军总政治部主任职务的领导人中，王稼祥累计的时间最长。《王稼祥选集》收入有关红军政治工作的论著比较集中，有18篇，系统地阐述了红军政治工作建设的经验、原则和要求。这些论著凝集了王稼祥对红军政治工作建设的业绩和智慧。
    《政治工作是我们红军的生命线》是王稼祥在红军第一次全国政治工作会议上的开幕词。在这次会议上，他同朱德、周恩来一起，系统地总结过去的实践经验，明确地提出“政治工作是红军的生命线”的著名论断，把红军政治工作的重要性提到了十分准确的高度。这是一个具有长远意义的重要思想。王稼祥指出：“一切战争如果没有政治工作的保障是不能达到任务的。我们红军斗争的目的是为了解放工农，政治工作就是要提高红军战士与工农群众的积极性。政治工作是提高红军战斗力的原动力。”
    王稼祥对党史上两次关键性会议——遵义会议和六届六中全会的杰出贡献，是大家所熟知的。《坚决迅速北上建立川陕甘根据地》、《向北行动后应向洮河以东发展》，是在遵义会议后的长征途中在中央政治局会议上的发言，对于支持毛泽东正确的军事路线，抵制张国焘的错误主张有重大作用。《国际指示报告》是王稼祥传达共产国际指示的报告大纲，他指出，共产国际肯定了中国共产党的路线，“认为中共一年来建立了抗日统一战线，尤其是朱、毛等领导了八路军执行了党的新政策，国际认为中共的政治路线是正确的，中共在复杂的环境及困难条件下真正运用了马列主义。”“在领导机关中要在毛泽东为首的领导下解决问题，领导机关中要有亲密团结的空气。”这个报告对于维护以毛泽东为首的党中央的正确路线和统一领导有重大作用。
    《关于三民主义与共产主义》一文，全面地论述了三民主义与共产主义的相同点和不同点，科学地阐明了三民主义可以而且应当成为抗日民族统一战线的共同纲领和国共合作的政治基础。同时指出，中国共产党人承认三民主义为共同纲领，拥护三民主义之彻底实现而奋斗，但是绝不因为任何原因而一时一刻放弃共产主义的理想和马克思列宁主义的学说。
    《关于巩固党的几个问题》、《中央政治局关于巩固党的决定》、《为中国共产党的巩固和坚强而斗争》，集中提出了在全民族抗日战争的新的历史时期建设党、巩固党的重要见解和观点。王稼祥的基本观点是：不能为了党员数量而降低党的质量、党的水平。他认为：巩固党的中心一环是加强党内教育；党的纪律绝不能因为民族统一战线的政策而有所松懈，相反的，正因为统一战线的环境，党内纪律更应严格地维持；坚持正确地开展思想斗争，是巩固党的思想上的一致与党的团结的关键；建立新老干部间和谐的相互学习相互尊敬的关系，对于巩固党有一等重要的意义。
    《中国共产党与革命战争》一文，概括了党领导革命战争和革命军队的基本经验，阐明党在其发展过程中逐步认识了革命战争的重要性及其特点，分析了以毛泽东为代表的正确的军事理论与实践。王稼祥十分强调知识对于革命军队的重要性，提出要用军事的、政治的、文化的丰富知识武装起来。这是一个富有战略眼光的主张，对我军建设的意义十分重大。
    《政治局要以思想领导为中心》，是王稼祥在1941年9月中央政治局扩大会议上发言的一部分。他说：“中国党过去的思想方法论存在着机械唯物论、形而上学同唯物辩证法的对立，毛主席代表了唯物辩证法，在白区刘少奇同志是代表了唯物辩证法。”《中国共产党与中国民族解放的道路》一文，是王稼祥参加整风学习、总结党的历史经验的杰出成果。这篇著名论文，首次提出毛泽东思想的科学概念，阐明毛泽东思想形成和发展的历史过程。指出：“中国民族解放整个过程中——过去现在与未来——的正确道路就是毛泽东同志的思想，就是毛泽东同志在其著作中与实践中所指出的道路。毛泽东思想就是中国的马克思列宁主义，中国的布尔什维主义，中国的共产主义。”他还强调指出，毛泽东思想“是马克思列宁主义与中国革命运动实际经验相结合的结果”，“并且，这个理论也正在继续发展中。”
    《王稼祥选集》收入抗日战争时期的论著27篇。这些论著，对丰富新民主主义革命的思想理论起了重要作用，对党的集体智慧结晶的毛泽东思想比较完整地形成起来作出了卓越的贡献。
    作于1948年6月的《城市工作大纲》，根据东北解放区的实际情况尤其是接管哈尔滨市的实践经验，论述了城市工作的重要性，并着重在依靠工人阶级、集中精力恢复和发展城市生产、保护民族工商业、政权民主化等问题上作了精辟的阐述，提出了城市工作的一系列方针政策，其中有很多具有远见卓识的理论观点。
    收入《选集》的建国后的8篇论著，反映了王稼祥对党的对外联络工作和国际问题的一系列重要见解。《在中央国际活动工作会议上的开幕词》，是对建国初期我国民间国际活动的初步总结，着重阐述了国际活动工作的重要性。《坚持党际关系的平等原则》，指出马克思列宁主义政党之间的相互关系必须实行平等原则，相互关系中发生问题时应当采取“更多地批评自己，少批评别人”的方针。《要根据自己国家的情况决定自己的政策》，指出各国的情况不同，别国的经验只能作为参考，不能照抄照搬，一定要从本国的实际情况出发。
    尤其需要提出的，是1962年上半年写的两篇文章。《实事求是，量力而行》，阐明了对外援助的重要原则，援助是必要的，但必须实事求是，量力而行。特别是国内处于经济困难时期，
  “更要谨慎从事，不要说过头，做过头”。《略谈对某些国际问题的看法》，系统地阐述了对国际问题的观点和见解，针对当时国际共产主义运动的争论和我们党内的“左”的见解，提出自己独到的看法。但是王稼祥的正确观点和主张，当时被错误地指责为“三和一少”的修正主义路线。十年动乱开始后，又被阴谋家康生诬陷为“三降一灭”的反革命修正主义路线，横加批判。党的十一届三中全会后，经中央通报平反。经过历史的检验，王稼祥的这些论著，今天读起来，仍然使人感到很受教益。
