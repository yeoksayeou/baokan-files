The United Nations envoy met with the Iranian Foreign Minister.

According to a report by the Iranian radio station, Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati reiterated today during his meeting with UN envoy Eliaeson that Iran insists on fully implementing UN Resolution 598 without any preconditions.

Velayati said that Iran's demand is the only way to establish lasting peace in the Persian Gulf region.

Since last August, Iran and Iraq have held four rounds of talks under UN supervision, and both sides have expressed their willingness to implement UN Resolution 598. However, the two sides have differing opinions on how to implement the resolution and have not yet reached an agreement.

To break the deadlock, Eliaeson, as the special envoy of UN Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar, has been mediating between Tehran and Baghdad since the beginning of this month. It is reported that Iran and Iraq may hold a new round of peace talks by the end of this year.

    联合国特使会晤伊朗外长
    新华社德黑兰11月11日电  据伊朗电台报道，伊朗外交部长韦拉亚提今天在会见联合国特使伊莱亚森时，重申伊朗主张不带任何先决条件的情况下全面执行联合国598号决议。
    韦拉亚提说，伊朗的这一要求是在海湾地区建立持久和平的唯一方法。
    自去年8月以来，两伊在联合国的监督之下已举行四轮会谈，双方都表示愿意执行联合国598号决议。但双方在如何执行598号决议问题上各持己见，至今没有达成协议。
    为打破僵局，伊莱亚森作为联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔的特使从本月初开始，在德黑兰和巴格达之间进行斡旋。据报道，两伊可能在今年底举行新一轮和平谈判。
