Three major global cultural cooperation and exchange projects initiated by UNESCO—the comprehensive survey of the Silk Road, the reconstruction of the Library of Alexandria, and the preparations for the 500th anniversary of the "Encounter of Two Worlds"—are currently underway.

The famous Silk Road, with a history of 2,000 years, has been an important channel for economic, trade, and cultural exchanges between the East and the West. In 1987, the 24th session of UNESCO, at the proposal of China, Italy, the Soviet Union, and other countries, formulated the "Comprehensive Survey Plan of the Silk Road." This is the first multi-disciplinary international survey plan for the Silk Road. In May of last year, scholars from China, the Soviet Union, Japan, Egypt, Pakistan, France, Iran, Oman, and other countries established a survey consultation committee to formulate specific survey plans. According to this plan, the survey of the Silk Road will be conducted in three routes: water, grassland, and land. It is reported that the water route survey, which is expected to take 17 months, will begin next year.

The reconstruction of the Library of Alexandria was proposed by the Egyptian government and has received the support of UNESCO, being included in the "World Decade for Cultural Development" plan. The Library of Alexandria, built 2,000 years ago during the Ptolemaic dynasty, was a unique cultural center in the world at that time. The site and remaining artifacts of the library have become important historical evidence for experts from various countries to study ancient architecture, history, art, philosophy, and other fields. The Egyptian government plans to rebuild a large library with a collection of 4 to 8 million books next to the site of the Ptolemaic Palace in Alexandria. The project is estimated to cost $160 million. Upon completion, it will become an important cultural exchange center in the world. Last year, the library held a groundbreaking ceremony, attended by UNESCO Director-General Federico Mayor and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. In September of this year, UNESCO organized an international competition for the library's architectural design, selecting the best design from more than 500 entries by a Norwegian architect.

The "Encounter of Two Worlds" refers to the famous navigator Christopher Columbus' voyage from Palos de la Frontera, Spain, across the Atlantic Ocean to the Bahamas, Cuba, Haiti, and other islands in 1492, marking the first encounter between the peoples of the Euro-Asian continent and the American continent. The UNESCO Executive Board proposed in October last year to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the encounter of the two hemispheres (1992) as part of the "World Decade for Cultural Development."

　　三项世界性文化合作
    由联合国教科文组织发起的三大世界性文化合作交流项目：“丝绸之路”综合考察、重建埃及亚历山大图书馆和“两个世界会合”500周年纪念的筹备工作正在积极进行中。
    著名的“丝绸之路”已有2000年历史，它是沟通东西方经济、贸易和文化交流的重要渠道。1987年，教科文组织第24届大会根据中国、意大利、苏联等国的提议，制定了《“丝绸之路”综合考察计划》。这是迄今第一个对“丝绸之路”进行多学科国际性考察的计划。去年5月，中国、苏联、日本、埃及、巴基斯坦、法国、伊朗、阿曼等国学者成立了考察协商委员会，制定具体的考察计划。根据这一计划，“丝绸之路”的考察将分水路、草原和陆路三条路线先后进行。据悉，预计将历时17个月的水路考察将于明年开始。
    重建亚历山大图书馆是埃及政府提出的，它得到了教科文组织的支持，并被列入“世界文化发展十年”计划中。位于埃及亚历山大港的亚历山大图书馆兴建于2000年前的托勒密王朝，是当时世界上独一无二的文化中心。图书馆的遗址和遗留的文物现已成为世界各国专家研究世界古代建筑、历史、艺术、哲学等的重要历史实证。埃及政府计划在亚历山大港托勒密王宫遗址旁重建一所藏书量将达400万至800万册的大型图书馆。这项工程估计耗资1.6亿美元。建成后，将成为世界一个重要的文化交流中心。去年图书馆举行了奠基典礼，教科文组织总干事马约尔和埃及总统穆巴拉克出席了典礼。今年9月，教科文组织举办图书馆建筑设计方案国际大赛，从500多份方案中评选出挪威建筑师的最佳设计。
    “两个世界会合”是指著名航海家哥伦布1492年从西班牙巴罗斯港出发，横穿大西洋，抵达美洲巴哈马群岛和古巴、海地等岛屿，实现欧亚大陆和美洲大陆人民之间的首次会合。教科文组织执行局去年10月提议，把纪念东西两个半球会合的500周年（1992年）作为“世界文化发展十年”中的一项内容。
