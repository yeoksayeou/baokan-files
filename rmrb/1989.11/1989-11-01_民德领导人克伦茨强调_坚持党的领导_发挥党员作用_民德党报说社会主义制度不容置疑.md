East German leader Krenz emphasizes
Maintaining Party leadership and role of Party members
East German Party newspaper says the socialist system is beyond doubt

BEIJING, Oct. 31 (Xinhua) — According to today's *Neues Deutschland*, East German United Socialist Party General Secretary Egon Krenz yesterday, when meeting with graduates of the Military Academy, emphasized that Party leadership must be maintained and the role of Communist Party members must be played.

Krenz said, "We must clearly recognize under what banner we are advancing, what kind of party we represent, and what kind of cause we represent. There can be no hesitation or wavering on this point."

He said, "Although the Politburo made some mistakes in the past period, such as not conducting enough criticism and self-criticism, and not sufficiently recognizing the problems raised by life, it is not possible to conclude from this that the East German United Socialist Party has lost the ability to lead. If that were the case, it would be to deny the strength of the East German United Socialist Party, to negate its experience, and to underestimate the role of more than 2 million Party members and candidate members."

Krenz urged Communist Party members to strive to play their role. He said, "At any time, standing for the truth is not easy. Wherever there is a Communist Party member fighting, there is the Party. It has always been like this in the past, and it is like this now."

Krenz emphasized the importance of maintaining the unity and solidarity of the Party. He pointed out that without the unity and solidarity of the Party, there would be no unity and solidarity of the entire people.

BEIJING, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) — The East German Party newspaper *Neues Deutschland* published a commentary on October 30 saying that the socialist system is beyond doubt.

The commentary emphasized that in the current nationwide open dialogue, no one is allowed to attack the legal foundation of the German Democratic Republic, a socialist workers' and peasants' state, nor is anyone allowed to attack the leadership role of the working class and its Marxist-Leninist party under any pretext.

    民德领导人克伦茨强调
    坚持党的领导　发挥党员作用
    民德党报说社会主义制度不容置疑
    本报柏林10月31日电　记者许宏治报道：据《新德意志报》今日消息，德国统一社会党中央总书记埃贡·克伦茨昨天在接见军事学院毕业生时强调，必须坚持党的领导，发挥共产党员的作用。
    克伦茨说，必须清楚地认识到，我们是在什么样的旗帜下前进，我们代表什么样的党，代表什么样的事业。在这一点上不能犹豫和动摇。
    他说，虽然政治局在过去一段时间里有一些失误，如没有开展足够的批评与自我批评，没有足够地认识到生活提出的问题，但是决不能由此得出结论说，德国统一社会党已经没有能力发挥领导作用了。如果那样，那就是否认了德国统一社会党的力量，否定了它的经验，低估了200多万党员和候补党员的作用。
    克伦茨要求共产党员努力发挥党员作用。他说，在任何时候，代表真理都不是容易的事。哪里只要有一个共产党员在坚持战斗，哪里就有党。过去一贯是这样，现在也是这样。
    克伦茨强调维护党的统一和团结的重要性。他指出，没有党的统一和团结，就没有全体人民的统一和团结。
    新华社柏林10月30日电民主德国党报《新德意志报》30日发表评论说，社会主义制度是不容置疑的。
    评论强调指出，在当前全国范围内的公开对话中，不允许任何人攻击社会主义工农政权的民主德国的法律基础，也不允许任何人以各种借口攻击工人阶级及其马克思列宁主义政党的领导作用。
