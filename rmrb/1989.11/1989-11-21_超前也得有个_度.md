Three letters to the editor discussed the issue of excessive land use in urban construction. This is a topic worth further discussion.

In the past, there has been a widespread problem of land waste in the construction of small towns. Some towns have adopted a "wide for narrow use" approach; others have used the "ant climbing a tree" method, building wherever they can, gradually encroaching on vast tracts of farmland. Currently, China has over 50,000 small towns, and this number is still growing. How can we allow such practices to continue?

It is undeniable that every town needs to develop, and urban construction inevitably involves some degree of advancement. However, there should be a limit to how far ahead of time we plan. What is the appropriate extent of this advancement? How do we control it? Urban planning departments must have a clear understanding. First, they need a scientific blueprint, so that construction can proceed in an orderly manner and avoid chaos.

### 超前也得有个“度”

　　超前也得有个“度”
    三篇来稿都谈到了城镇建设用地超前的问题。这个问题很值得进一步讨论。
    小城镇建设中，过去普遍存在着浪费土地的现象。有的“宽打窄用”；有的采用“蚂蚁上树”的办法，建到哪里算哪里，大片蚕食良田。目前，我国小城镇已达5万多个，仍在发展壮大之中，怎能容忍这种现象继续下去？
    不可否认，每个城镇都要发展，城镇建设难免要相应超前。但是，超前也得有个“度”。这个“度”究竟多大合适？如何控制好这个“度”？城镇建设规划部门心里要有数，首先要有个科学的蓝图，建设起来才有章可循，不至于乱套。
