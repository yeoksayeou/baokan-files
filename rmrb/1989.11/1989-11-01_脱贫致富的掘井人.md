	The village of Sanhuanggou in Luchun Town, Yiyuan County, is a remote hamlet in the Yimeng Mountain area with 630 residents and 560 acres of thin, hilly land. Historically, water has been as precious as oil. Villagers had to travel five miles to fetch water, and crops depended on the weather. The village was infamous for its poverty, with an average annual income of less than 100 yuan per person. In 1986, the Linyi Road Section's poverty alleviation team arrived at the village and made solving the water shortage their top priority. Despite failing to drill wells in three locations, they were determined: "If we can't find water, we won't return to Linyi!"

	The team leader, Chen Shancmin, heard about a water diviner from a neighboring county and traveled over 100 miles to bring him to the village. Finally, they successfully drilled the first well in Sanhuanggou, providing water for both humans and livestock and irrigating 490 acres of farmland.

	Over the next three years, they helped Sanhuanggou village establish an orchard, planting 8 acres of peach trees, and set up several industrial and sideline projects, including a cement prefabricated component factory, a carpet factory, a lime kiln, and a stone processing plant. Before the poverty alleviation efforts, the village's average annual income was 47 yuan. Now, it has increased to 500 yuan per person. The Linyi Road Section's poverty alleviation team has become the well-diggers who led Sanhuanggou village to prosperity.

    脱贫致富的掘井人
    我县鲁村镇三黄沟村是位于沂蒙山区一个偏僻的山庄，拥有630口人，560亩山岭薄地。自古以来，水贵如油，村民用水需跑到5里外提担，庄稼靠天收，原是个人均收入不足100元、远近闻名的穷村。1986年，临沂地区公路段扶贫组到这个村，把村民急需解决的吃水难问题视为第一件扶贫实事来办。在3处打井都未能成功的情况下，他们横下一条心：打不出水来，就不回临沂城！组长陈善民听说邻县有个看水奇才，就亲自赶路100多里，请出能人帮助。最终，他们如愿以偿，在三黄沟打出了有史以来的第一眼水井，从而解决了全村的人畜用水和490亩粮田灌溉之需。
    3年来，他们还帮助三黄沟村新建了桃园，栽了8亩桃树，兴建了水泥预制品厂、地毯厂、石灰窑、石料加工厂等工副业项目。扶贫前，这个村人均年收入47元，现在人均收入已达500元。临沂公路段扶贫组成为三黄沟村脱贫致富的掘井人。
