Gansu Mobilizes Farmers to Build "Three Fields" Year After Year
Drought-Affected Areas See Improved Production Conditions, Grain Output Increases for Six Consecutive Years

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, November 4 – Reporter Zhang Shusheng reports: Starting from the province's actual situation, Gansu has been carrying out agricultural infrastructure construction centered on building "three fields" (terrace fields, sand fields, and gully fields) for many years in a row. This has transformed "three-run fields" (fields that lose water, soil, and fertilizer) into "three-protect fields," gradually improving production conditions and achieving a steady increase in grain production for six consecutive years. In 1988, the province's total grain output reached 5.9 billion kilograms, setting a historical high. This year, the total grain output has increased significantly compared to last year, but the grain situation remains grim.

Gansu is a province with many mountains and little land, and it is dry and lacks rain. Except for the Hexi Corridor and parts of the upper Yellow River region, which are irrigated agriculture, the areas east of the Yellow River, including Longdong, Longzhong, Longnan, and the Diao-Bin Mountains, are all dryland farming areas. These regions account for more than 80% of the province's agricultural population, arable land, and grain sowing area. Moreover, the soil is infertile, and soil erosion is severe, leading to low and unstable grain yields, which severely constrain the development of the entire rural economy.

To encourage farmers to increase their investment in land and mobilize their enthusiasm for building "three fields," Gansu Province has formulated corresponding policies and regulations: on contracted land, whoever builds "three fields" benefits from them; the usage rights, management rights, and benefits of "three fields" remain unchanged for a long time; when the usage rights are transferred, the increase in land fertility should be compensated according to the fertility level; each rural labor force should contribute at least 20 days of labor per year, mainly for agricultural infrastructure construction; for each mu (1/15 of a hectare) of "three fields" that passes the acceptance inspection, the state provides a subsidy of 30 yuan; linking the construction of terrace fields with the supply of phosphate fertilizer, etc.

According to statistics from relevant provincial departments, by the end of 1988, the province had built 13.02 million mu of "three fields," of which 4 million mu were built in the past five years. Since the beginning of this winter, nearly 1 million laborers have been invested in building "three fields" across the province, with 1.9 million mu of new terrace fields built, accounting for more than 20% of the annual plan.

    甘肃连年动员农民修“三田”
    旱区生产条件改善　粮食连续六年增产
    本报兰州11月4日电　记者张述圣报道：甘肃省从本省实际出发，连续多年开展以修建“三田”（梯田、砂田、沟坝地）为中心的农田基本建设，把“跑水、跑土、跑肥”的三跑田变成“三保田”，生产条件逐步得到改善，粮食生产连续6年稳步增长。1988年全省粮食总产量达59亿公斤，创历史最高水平。今年粮食总产比去年有较大幅度增长，但粮食形势仍不容乐观。
    甘肃山多地少，干旱缺雨。除河西走廊、黄河上游部分地区为灌溉农业外，黄河以东的陇东、陇中、陇南及洮岷山区，均属旱作农业。这些地区农业人口、耕地面积、粮食播种面积均占全省的80％以上，而且土质瘠薄，水土流失严重，粮食产量低而不稳，严重制约整个农村经济的发展。
    为了鼓励农民增加对土地的投入，调动他们修建“三田”的积极性，甘肃省制订了相应的政策规定：在承包土地上修建“三田”，坚持谁修建、谁受益；使用权、管理权、受益权长期不变；投工、投肥修建“三田”，地力提高，使用权转移时，应按肥力等级补偿投资；每个农村劳动力每年至少投入20个义务工，主要用于农田基本建设；每修一亩经验收合格的“三田”，国家给予30元补助费；兴修梯田与供应磷肥挂钩等。
    据省有关部门统计，截至1988年底，全省已修建“三田”1302万亩，其中400万亩是近5年内修建的。今年入冬以来，全省投入修建“三田”的劳力已近100万人，新修梯田19万亩，占年度计划的20％以上。
