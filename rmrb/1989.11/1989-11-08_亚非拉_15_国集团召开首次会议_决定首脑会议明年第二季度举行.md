The Group of 15 from Asia, Africa, and Latin America held its first meeting on November 6 in Geneva. On November 7, the meeting decided that the first summit of the Group of 15 from Asia, Africa, and Latin America will be held in the second quarter of next year. According to a Latin American source close to the meeting, the summit will be held in May next year, just before the summit of the Western Seven Nations.

It was initiated by Peruvian President Alan García and announced at the Belgrade Summit of Non-Aligned Movement countries in September this year after consultations among the heads of state of the relevant countries.

The private representatives of the 15 member countries attended the meeting.

The 15 member countries of the Group of 15 from Asia, Africa, and Latin America are Algeria, Argentina, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Venezuela, Yugoslavia, Zambia, Mexico, and Brazil. The Group of 15 from Asia, Africa, and Latin America aims to study the world economic situation, strengthen South-South cooperation, and promote North-South dialogue.
