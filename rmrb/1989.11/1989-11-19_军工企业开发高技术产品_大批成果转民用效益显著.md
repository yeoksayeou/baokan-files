The rapid establishment and development of high-tech industries are the hope for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The defense industry group, which has more than 1,200 factories and nearly 3 million employees, should be the best growth point for China's high-tech industries. This view is a consensus among experts attending the Third National High-Tech Industry Development Symposium held here.

According to the symposium, China's defense science and technology industry has initially achieved a transition to a military-civilian integration and has achieved significant results. From 1987 to 1988 alone, the number of defense technology projects transferred to civilian use reached more than 10,000, with a transaction volume of nearly 1 billion yuan. A large number of advanced defense technologies, such as satellite remote sensing, nuclear technology, precision machining, and refrigeration, are being widely applied in geological exploration, machinery, textiles, and other sectors, and have played an important role in promoting the technological transformation of traditional industries.

Statistics show that the national defense industry system has so far developed more than 1,000 civilian products with high technological intensity, and technological products have been exported to more than 40 countries and regions.

The symposium believes that China's defense high-tech industry already accounts for 30% of the entire defense industry, with strong technological strength and relatively stable research and development investment. Appropriate measures and policies should be taken to make it the main force in China's high-tech industries. Currently, the defense system still has a considerable number of national-level defense science and technology achievements that have not been utilized, which are a treasure trove with enormous development potential.

The National High-Tech Industry Development Symposium, which opened today, is jointly organized by the State Planning Commission, the State Science and Technology Commission, the State Education Commission, the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Experts, scholars from the high-tech research field across the country, and responsible persons from relevant national departments will discuss and study issues such as "military-civilian integration, common promotion, development of high-tech industries, and strategies, plans, and policies for the development of high-tech industries."

    军工企业开发高技术产品
    大批成果转民用效益显著
    本报贵阳11月18日电　记者孔晓宁、胡跃平报道：迅速建立并发展高技术产业，是中华民族振兴的希望所在。拥有1200多家工厂及近300万职工的军工企业集团，应当成为我国高技术产业的最佳生长点。这一看法，是正在此间出席第三届全国高技术产业发展研讨会的专家们的共识。
    据会议透露，目前我国国防科技工业已初步实现向军民结合转变，并取得明显效益。仅1987年至1988年，军工技术向民用转移项目即达1万多项，成交额近10亿元。一大批国防尖端技术，诸如卫星遥感、核技术、精密加工、制冷等技术，正被广泛地应用于地质勘探、机械、纺织等部门，并对推动传统产业的技术改造发挥了重要作用。
    据统计，全国军工系统迄今已开发出技术密集程度较高的支柱性民品达千种以上，技术产品已远销40多个国家和地区。
    会议认为，我国国防高技术产业已占整个国防企业的30％，拥有较强的技术力量和比较稳定的科研投入，应当采取适当的措施与政策，使之成为我国高技术产业中的主力军。目前，军工系统尚有相当一批国家级国防科技成果未能利用，它们是一笔有着巨大开发潜力的财富。
    今天开幕的全国高技术产业发展研讨会，是由国家计委、国家科委、国家教委、国防科工委和中国科学院共同举办的，来自全国各地高技术研究领域的专家、学者和国家有关部委的负责人，将围绕“军民结合、共同促进、发展高技术产业、以及高技术产业发展的战略、计划和政策”等问题，广泛地讨论和研究。
