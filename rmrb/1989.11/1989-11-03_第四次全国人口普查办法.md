Article 2: The subjects of the census are individuals with Chinese nationality who reside in the People's Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as "individuals").

Article 3: The census work will be carried out under the leadership of the State Council and local governments at various levels.

The State Council and the people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, the people's governments of prefecture-level cities, autonomous prefectures, and regional administrative public offices, and the people's governments of counties, autonomous counties, county-level cities, and districts, will establish census leading groups and their offices. Townships, towns, and street offices will establish census offices. Village committees and residents' committees will establish census groups, respectively responsible for the leadership, organization, and specific implementation of the census.

Article 4: The census will be conducted by mobilizing social forces extensively.

Local governments at all levels should do a good job of census publicity, fully utilize various publicity tools, and adopt various forms to publicize the significance of the census, mobilize the masses to actively participate in the census, and ensure that everyone is aware of it.

Article 5: The census should be divided into census areas and survey sub-areas.

In rural areas, the jurisdiction of a village committee will be used as a census area. In cities and towns, the jurisdiction of a residents' committee will be used as a census area.

Each census area will be divided into several survey sub-areas according to the workload that a census taker can handle.

Article 6: The census will be conducted by household registration. Households are divided into family households and collective households.

Individuals with family relationships as the main criterion, living together in one place, will be considered as one family household; individuals living alone will also be considered as one family household.

Individuals without family relationships, living together in collective dormitories within a unit or other accommodations, will be considered as one collective household. The population in branch collective dormitories of the above-mentioned units and collective dormitories outside the unit's jurisdiction will be considered as another collective household.

Article 7: The census will be conducted by registering the permanent population. Each person must be registered at their place of permanent residence. A person can only be registered in one place.

The population that should be registered in the census of the county or city is:

(1) Individuals who have permanent residence in the county or city and have registered their permanent residence in the county or city;
(2) Individuals who have lived in the county or city for more than one year but have permanent residence in another place;
(3) Individuals who have lived in the county or city for less than one year but have left their place of permanent residence for more than one year;
(4) Individuals who are residing in the county or city at the time of the census and whose permanent residence is undetermined;
(5) Individuals who originally resided in the county or city, are working or studying abroad at the time of the census, and have no permanent residence.

Individuals with permanent residence in the county or city but who have left the county or city for more than one year will only be registered for the number of people in their place of permanent residence and will not be included in the permanent population of the place of permanent residence.

To prevent duplication and omission, for the individuals in the second paragraph of the preceding item (3), the census offices of the temporary residence township, town, or street will, before May 31, 1990, notify in writing the census groups of the village committees or residents' committees in the place of permanent residence to exempt them from the census.

Article 8: The census form will have 21 items.

Items to be filled out per person will be 15:

Article 11: Before the census registration begins, census agencies at all levels should, in accordance with the "Regulations on Household Registration of the People's Republic of China" and other relevant state regulations on household registration, conduct household registration rectification. Based on the household registration rectification work, they should, in accordance with the census area division rules, clarify the geographical boundaries and house numbers of each census area, and compile a list of household heads' names in each census area based on the verified household registration materials, as a reference for census registration. During the household registration rectification, attention should be paid to preventing the omission of individuals who have household registration in other counties or cities but have lived in this county or city for more than one year.

Article 12: The census registration work will be carried out by census takers, with census supervisors responsible for guidance and inspection, and grassroots cadres and active members of the masses assisting in the work.

The selected personnel should be politically reliable, have at least a junior high school education, be trusted by the masses, responsible, in good health, and capable of handling census work. After short-term training and passing the test, the census agencies will issue certificates to these personnel. Before the census task is completed, census takers and census supervisors will not be reassigned to work outside the census.

Article 13: The census registration method will mainly adopt the method of census takers visiting households to inquire and fill out forms on the spot; if necessary, it can also adopt the method of setting up registration stations in the census area. Census takers should inquire about each household and each individual in detail and fill out the forms item by item; the declarant must report truthfully to ensure that there is no duplication or omission and that the information is accurate.

After completing the registration of a household, the census taker should read the contents of the registration to the declarant of the household for verification.

Census workers must keep the information of each household confidential and shall not provide or leak it to units and individuals outside the census agencies.
