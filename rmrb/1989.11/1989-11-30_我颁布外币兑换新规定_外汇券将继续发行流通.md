People's Daily, Beijing, November 29th. Reporter Wang Xingzeng reports: The foreign exchange certificates issued by China since April 1980 have played a positive role in currency circulation. However, in recent years, illegal activities such as private trading of foreign exchange certificates or using them to purchase foreign currency have been occurring frequently.

To strengthen the management of foreign exchange certificates and prevent arbitrage, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange has issued the "Regulations on Several Issues Regarding Foreign Currency Exchange."

The main contents of these regulations, which were issued at the end of last month, are as follows:

1. Foreign diplomatic missions, consulates, business and civilian organizations, and international organizations stationed in China can withdraw foreign exchange certificates from their foreign currency or special RMB accounts in banks. Unused foreign exchange certificates cannot be exchanged back into foreign currency but can continue to be used within China.

2. Staff members of the above-mentioned organizations who leave China and wish to exchange unused foreign exchange certificates into foreign currency for remittance or to take out of the country must present their exit proof or airline ticket, as well as a foreign exchange receipt within six months, to receive no more than 50% of the original amount of foreign currency. Those who do not leave the country cannot exchange back to foreign currency.

3. Foreign tourists, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan who visit China for a short period and wish to exchange back to foreign currency must provide a foreign exchange receipt within six months, exit proof, or airline ticket to the bank. They are allowed to exchange back no more than 50% of the original amount of foreign currency once.

This regulation will be implemented starting from October 30th. Foreign exchange certificates exchanged at banks before this date can still be handled according to the original regulations.

A responsible person from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said when introducing this new regulation that some Eastern European countries also have similar regulations. This does not harm the interests of foreign exchange certificate holders. It is reasonable to limit the exchange back of foreign currency to no more than 50% of the original amount for long-term residents leaving the country and short-term visitors entering the country, as they need to spend money within China and can exchange foreign currency based on their actual needs in China.

This responsible person also said that the implementation of the new regulation does not mean the cancellation of foreign exchange certificates and will not affect the issuance and circulation of foreign exchange certificates.

The foreign exchange certificates from the operational income of Sino-foreign joint ventures are not subject to this regulation and will continue to be executed according to the "Law on Sino-foreign Joint Ventures."

### 我颁布外币兑换新规定　外汇券将继续发行流通

　　我颁布外币兑换新规定
　　外汇券将继续发行流通
    本报北京11月29日讯　记者王行增报道：中国自1980年4月发行的外汇券，在货币流通中起到了积极作用。但近几年，私自倒卖外汇券，或以外汇券套购外币的非法行为不断发生。
    为加强对外汇券的管理，防止套汇，国家外汇管理局发布了《关于外币兑换若干问题的规定》。
    这项上月底发布的规定主要内容是：
    一，各国驻华外交代表、领事机构和商务、民间机构以及国际组织，从其在银行开立的外币存款帐户或人民币特种存款帐户中提取外汇兑换券后，其未使用的外汇券不得兑回外币，只能在中国境内继续使用。
    二，上述机构所属常驻人员离开中国国境时，如要求将未用完的外汇券兑换成外币汇出或携带出境，银行凭本人出境证明或飞机票以及六个月内的兑换水单，兑给不超过原换数50％的外汇，不出境者不能兑回外币。
    三，短期来华的外国旅游者、华侨、港澳台同胞如要求兑回外币时，须向银行提供6个月内的兑换水单、出境证明或飞机票，准予一次性兑回不超过原兑换数50％的外币。
    这一规定自10月30日起实行。在这以前向银行兑换的外汇券，仍可按原来的规定办。
    国家外汇管理局一位负责人在介绍这一新规定时说，一些东欧国家也有类似的规定，这对外汇券兑换人的利益没有损害，离境常驻人员和短期入境旅客限制兑回不超过原兑换数50％的外汇是合理的，因为他们在中国境内需要花费，他们可从根据在中国的实际需要匡算兑换外币。
    这位负责人还说，新规定的实行，不意味取消外汇券，也不影响外汇券的发行和流通。
    中外合资企业营业收入的外汇券，不受此规定限制，仍按《中外合资企业法》执行。
