Shanghai's retail price index has fallen to single digits in October, according to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Urban Social and Economic Survey Team. The index for October was 109.2 compared to the same period last year, a decrease of 20.5 percentage points from the peak in February this year. This is the first time since November 1987 that Shanghai's price index has dropped back to single digits.

The significant reduction in Shanghai's price increases is mainly due to the city's efforts in rectification and control of prices and stabilization of the market by the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government. The implementation of the "Vegetable Basket" project has led to a steady decline in the prices of agricultural and sideline products in Shanghai. Additionally, the price control department noted that the "carryover" effect from last year's price increases is gradually diminishing, and the sluggish market sales have also contributed to the decline in the price index.

    上海零售物价指数下降
    10月份回落到一位数
    新华社上海11月10日电　（记者汪洪洋）上海市城市社会经济调查队的统计表明，刚刚过去的10月份，上海零售物价指数与去年同期相比为109.2，比今年物价上涨幅度最高的2月份下跌20.5个百分点。这是上海市从1987年11月物价指数上升到二位数以来，第一次重新回落到一位数。
    上海物价上涨幅度明显下降，主要是今年市委、市政府在治理整顿中全力以赴控制物价、稳定市场的结果。“菜篮子”工程的实施，使上海农副食品价格逐月稳中有降。此外，物价部门分析说，目前，由去年涨价影响今年物价的“翘尾巴”因素正逐渐消除，再加上市场销售不旺也促使物价指数下降。
