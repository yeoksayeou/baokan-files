Every last Monday and Tuesday of August, residents of Northern Ireland gather in Ballycastle to participate in the annual Harvest Festival Market.

The market dates back to 1606, and to this day, it remains an important venue for the exchange of agricultural and pastoral products between the Irish and the Scots. Today, the ancient market has evolved into a tourist attraction and a place to trace local traditional commerce.

    每逢8月最后一个星期一和星期二，北爱尔兰的居民便云集巴利法斯尔，参加一年一度的收获节集市。
    这个集市源于1606年，直至今日，它是爱尔兰和苏格兰人交换农牧产品的重要集市。如今，古老的集市已成为旅游和追踪当地传统贸易的场所。
