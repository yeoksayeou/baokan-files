Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 4th — Heilongjiang Province has implemented a series of effective policies to support large and medium-sized key enterprises in overcoming difficulties.

Heilongjiang Province has 372 large and medium-sized industrial enterprises. These enterprises have been plagued by shortages in funds, energy, transportation, and raw materials throughout the third quarter of this year. By the end of August, 98 of these enterprises were operating at a loss, with a total loss of 11.7 billion yuan. These large and medium-sized enterprises make up only 5% of the total number of independent accounting enterprises in the province, but their losses account for 88% of the province's total losses.

In response to this situation, Heilongjiang Province has taken decisive measures from a macro perspective to help large and medium-sized enterprises get out of their predicament. The province first selected 136 key enterprises as the focus of support. These 136 key enterprises account for 48.6% of the total industrial output value of budgetary enterprises in the province and 65.5% of the total profit and tax revenue of budgetary enterprises in the province. To help these enterprises solve production problems, the Provincial Economic Commission's Production Dispatching Bureau coordinates the work of various economic management departments at any time and gives full support in the supply of coal, electricity, transportation, funds, and raw materials. The provincial government, in conjunction with banks and other departments, has decided to implement a separate loan plan for these enterprises, with centralized management, and other units cannot encroach upon it. The province will allocate 20% to 30% of the new savings deposits for the year to these enterprises for loans.

    能源运输资金和原材料供应全面照顾
    黑龙江为骨干企业排忧解难
    新华社哈尔滨11月4日电　（记者谢金虎、通讯员张宝东）黑龙江省采取一系列切实有效的倾斜政策帮助大中型骨干企业解决困难。
    黑龙江省有372家大中型工业企业。今年三季度，这些企业一直因资金、能源、交通和原材料紧张受到困扰，截至8月末统计，已有98家亏损，亏损额达11.7亿元。这个省的大中型企业数仅占全省独立核算企业总数的5％，但亏损额却占全省亏损总额的88％。
    针对这情况，黑龙江省从全局利益出发，果断采取措施帮助大中型企业摆脱困境。他们首先筛选出136家骨干企业作为重点倾斜的对象。这136家骨干企业的产值占全省预算内工业企业总产值的48.6％，实现利税占全省预算内工业企业实现利税总额的65.5％。为了帮助这批企业解决生产中的难题，省计委生产调度局随时协调各经济主管部门开展工作，并在煤、电、运、资金和原材料的供应上全面倾斜。省政府还会同银行等部门作出决定，对这些企业实行贷款计划单列，集中管理，其他单位不能挤占，拿出全省当年新增储蓄存款的20％至30％，用于这些企业的贷款。
