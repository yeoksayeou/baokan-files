Vice Premier Tian Jiyun today said at a water conservancy site in the Beijing suburbs that, under the call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, a nationwide wave of agricultural water conservancy construction is forming, and the situation is gratifying. Ending the stagnation of agriculture and ascending to a new level is full of hope. He stressed that current rural work must adhere to the stability and continuity of the Party's policies, and must stabilize the hearts of 800 million farmers. Agricultural water conservancy construction must be carried out in a planned manner, and the people's money and labor must be cherished, with emphasis on the quality of the projects.

In recent days, the temperature in the capital has been below zero Celsius. This morning, Tian Jiyun and State Councilor Chen Junsheng, along with leaders from the Ministry of Water Resources, braved the cold wind to visit the water conservancy construction site in Shanhao Town, Changping County, on the outskirts of Beijing. They represented the State Council in extending warm greetings to more than 1,000 cadres and masses who are working hard on the front line of water conservancy construction despite the severe cold. Tian Jiyun, Chen Junsheng, and other leaders participated in labor at the construction site. Earlier, Minister of Water Resources Yang Zhenhui had led cadres from the Ministry of Water Resources to bring their own food to work here, and today another batch of cadres from the Ministry of Water Resources were working at the Shanhao site.

At the water conservancy construction site, Tian Jiyun said that since the Party Central Committee and the State Council convened the rural work conference last November, various levels of Party committees and governments have generally attached importance to agriculture, strengthened leadership, and increased investment. If it were not for the severe natural disasters in Northeast China and other regions this year, China's total grain production could have reached a historic high. Even so, major agricultural products have still achieved a good harvest nationwide, making this year a moderately good year. Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech on the 40th anniversary of National Day and the communiqué of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee have placed the issue of developing agricultural production in a very high position. I am deeply convinced that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, as long as the whole Party takes action, works together, and perseveres, China's agriculture will definitely be able to break out of the stagnation of the past few years and ascend to a new level.

Tian Jiyun pointed out that the basic construction of agricultural water conservancy this winter and last spring has been quite good, and the scale this winter and next spring will be even larger. It is believed that it will definitely be done better. Carrying out this work should be combined with doing a good job in water and soil conservation, transforming low- and medium-yield fields, accumulating farmyard manure, and afforestation, guiding the broad masses of farmers to invest labor and accumulate wealth for themselves and society. Carrying out agricultural water conservancy construction should strengthen organizational leadership and avoid any formalism and empty talk.

Chen Junsheng also spoke. He said that Beijing's water conservancy work this winter, with the leadership at all levels grasping it and doing it with a focus at each level, is good. Now, more than 40 million people nationwide are engaged in basic agricultural water conservancy construction, and we must pay attention to the quality of the projects, and succeed in every project we undertake.

    田纪云赴京郊水利工地慰问时说
    农业攀登新台阶大有希望
    当前要稳定政策稳定八亿农民的心
    据新华社北京11月18日电　（人民日报记者高保生、新华社记者黄正根、通讯员张学俭）国务院副总理田纪云今天在北京郊区水利工地上说，在党中央、国务院的号召下，一个全国性的农田水利建设热潮正在形成，形势可喜可贺，结束农业徘徊，攀登新的台阶，大有希望。他强调，当前农村工作必须坚持党的政策的稳定性、连续性，要稳住八亿农民的心；农田水利基本建设要有计划地搞，要十分爱惜民财民力，讲究工程质量。
    近日来，首都气温在摄氏零度以下。今天上午，田纪云同志和国务委员陈俊生以及水利部的领导同志，冒着寒风，来到京郊昌平县沙河镇水利工地，代表国务院向不畏严寒奋战在水利建设第一线的1000余名干部、群众表示亲切慰问。田纪云、陈俊生等领导同志在工地参加了劳动。在此之前，水利部部长杨振怀曾带领水利部机关干部自带干粮到这里劳动，今天又有一批水利部机关干部在沙河工地劳动。
    在水利工地，田纪云说，自去年11月党中央、国务院召开农村工作会议以来，各级党委和政府普遍重视农业，加强了领导，增加了投入，今年如果不是东北等部分地区遭受严重自然灾害的话，我国粮食总产可望创历史最高水平。即使如此，就全国来讲，主要农产品仍然获得好收成，属中等偏上年景。江泽民同志国庆40周年讲话和十三届五中全会公报，把发展农业生产问题提到非常高的位置。我深信，在党中央、国务院领导下，只要全党动手，齐心合力，持之以恒，我国农业一定能够打破几年来的徘徊局面，再登一个新台阶。
    田纪云指出，去冬今春我国农田水利基本建设开展得不错，今冬明春规模更大，相信一定会搞得更好。开展这项工作，要与搞好水土保持，改造中低产田，广积农家肥，植树造林结合起来，引导广大农民投入劳动积累，为自己为社会谋福利。开展农田水利建设，要加强组织领导，切不可搞任何形式主义和花架子。
    陈俊生同志也讲了话。他说，北京市今冬搞水利，领导层层抓，层层有重点的做法好。现在全国有4000多万人投入农田水利基本建设，一定要注意工程质量，搞一处，成功一处。
