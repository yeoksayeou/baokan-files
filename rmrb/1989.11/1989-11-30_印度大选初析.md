The results of India's ninth general election have been announced. The ruling Congress Party failed to secure a majority in the Lok Sabha, losing its ability to form a government alone. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has submitted his resignation to President Venkataraman and has stated that he will not engage in government formation activities. Meanwhile, opposition leaders are actively working to form a coalition government that excludes the Congress Party. India's political landscape is undergoing significant changes.

India's general election began on November 22, with approximately 500 million voters participating in the vote. Over 6,100 candidates ran in the election, making it the largest in India's history and the most competitive between the ruling and opposition parties. The Congress Party has been in power for about 40 of the 42 years since India's independence. In the previous election, it achieved a landslide victory, securing 415 out of 542 seats in the Lok Sabha. At that time, Rajiv Gandhi had been Prime Minister for only two months, surpassing the achievements of his grandfather Nehru and his mother Indira Gandhi. However, this time, the Congress Party suffered a significant defeat.

The Congress Party's failure was not entirely unexpected. In recent years, regional political forces, primarily opposition parties, have been vigorously competing with the Congress Party for control. Since the end of 1985, the Congress Party lost in seven out of eight state legislative elections. The northern states have traditionally been the Congress Party's stronghold. In June 1986, the Congress Party lost the Haryana state legislative election. Including Haryana, the five northern states account for approximately 40% of the Lok Sabha seats, and the Congress Party again lost to the opposition's "heartland strategy" in this election. The Congress Party's defeat can be attributed to two main factors:

First, Rajiv Gandhi's performance has been lackluster, turning many voters from hope to disappointment. Since taking office in 1984, although Rajiv Gandhi has brought some economic development to India, inflation, price increases, and rising unemployment rates in the past two years have directly affected voters' trust in the Congress Party. Additionally, internal conflicts within the Congress Party have intensified, with corruption scandals continually surfacing. In particular, the bribery case involving the Swedish company Bofors was exposed, gradually implicating Rajiv Gandhi and his relatives, causing a national uproar. In curbing the escalating sectarian conflicts, the Rajiv Gandhi government has not achieved significant results. In Punjab, terrorist activities have never stopped, with over a thousand people killed in conflicts since 1986 alone. In foreign relations, Rajiv Gandhi initially showed some initiative in improving relations with neighboring countries, but tensions with neighboring countries have continued to arise. During this election, opposition parties raised the banner of anti-corruption and price control, advocating for the maintenance of "traditional good-neighborly relations" with neighboring countries, and were very active, putting the Congress Party in a passive position.

Second, the opposition parties changed their previous "multi-cornered competition" strategy and adopted a united front. In previous elections, the opposition parties were fragmented and weak, with no single party able to compete with the Congress Party. In this election, the opposition parties learned from past experiences, not only reaching an understanding on a united front but also adjusting their candidates, jointly nominating one candidate in each of the 400 constituencies to compete with the Congress Party. This situation is rare in India's election history, causing the Congress Party to lose many of its previously held strongholds.

However, since no other party secured a majority in this election, India will see its first coalition government in 42 years of independence. According to reports, opposition leaders have rushed to New Delhi to discuss the formation of a coalition government that excludes the Congress Party. The National Front led by the Bharatiya Janata Party received the second-highest number of votes after the Congress Party, and its leaders claim to have the support of the Communist Party of India and other left-wing parties. The question of which party President Venkataraman will invite to form the government is currently a topic of interest in India. However, regardless of who takes the lead in forming the government, India will no longer be a one-party state but will see a reconfiguration of various political forces.

　　印度大选初析
　　本报记者　任毓骏
    印度第九届大选已经揭晓，执政的国大党在人民院获席位未过半数，失去单独组阁资格。拉·甘地总理已向文卡塔拉曼总统提出辞职，并表示放弃组阁活动。与此同时，反对党领导人正在加紧活动，准备组成排除国大党的联合政府。印度政局正在发生引人注目的变化。
    印度本届大选22日拉开序幕，共有约5亿选民参加投票，6100多人参加竞选是印度独立以来规模最大的选举，也是执政党和在野党最势均力敌的一次大选。国大党在印度独立42年来执政约40年，上届大选中，它获得压倒多数的胜利，在人民院542个议席中一举夺得415席。其时拉·甘地接任总理才两个月，这一成果超过了他的外祖父尼赫鲁和母亲英·甘地。而这一次选举，国大党却遭惨败。
    国大党的失败并非没有先兆。近年来，以反对党为主的地方政治势力极力与国大党争夺地盘。1985年底以来进行的8个邦的议会选举中，国大党在7个邦接连失败。北方诸邦向来是国大党的根据地。1986年6月，国大党在哈里亚纳邦议会选举中败北。包括哈邦在内的北印5邦共占人民院约40％的议席，这次大选国大党又败于反对党的“挖心战术”。国大党的失败，主要有两个方面的原因：
    一是拉·甘地政绩平平，使许多选民由期望转为失望。拉·甘地自1984年执政以来，虽然使印度经济有了一定发展，但近两年来通货膨胀，物价上涨，失业率升高，直接影响了选民对国大党的信任。此外，国大党内部矛盾加剧，贪污受贿丑闻接连曝光，尤其是与瑞典博弗尔斯公司的军火交易受贿案被揭露，逐步殃及拉·甘地本人及其亲属，引起全国轰动。在制止日益蔓延的教派冲突方面，拉·甘地政府未能取得明显成效，在旁遮普邦，恐怖活动从未停息，仅1986年以来，就有千余人死于冲突。在对外关系方面，拉·甘地一度对改善同邻国关系表现了一定的主动性，但同邻国的关系不断出现新的紧张。在此次选举过程中，各在野党打出反对贪污和制止涨价的旗帜，发表了维护同邻国“传统睦邻关系”的纲领，十分活跃，从而使国大党陷于被动。
    二是各在野党改变以往“多角竞选”策略，实行联合竞选。在以往历届大选中，反对党四分五裂，力量薄弱，没有一个党能与国大党抗衡。此次大选，反对党吸取了教训，不仅达成了联合竞选的谅解，而且对候选人作了调整，在全国400个选区中均共同推举一名候选人与国大党相争。这种局面在印度选举史上尚属少见，从而使国大党的许多过去属于自己的阵地连连失守。
    然而，由于在这次大选中其它各党也都没有获得多数议席，因此，印度将出现独立42年来第一个联合政府。据报道，反对党领袖们已纷纷赶到新德里，商讨组建排除国大党的联合政府。以人民党为首的全国阵线获票仅次于国大党，该党领导人宣称，已得到印度共产党、其他左派政党的支持。文卡塔拉曼总统究竟邀哪个党组阁，是眼下印度人关注的问题。但是，不管谁出面组阁，印度不再是一党执政，而将出现各派政治力量重新组合的局面。
