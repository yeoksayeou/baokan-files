**Why This Deep Affection?**
**A Conversation with Fei Xiang**

**Jiang Dewen**

Q: The "Fei Xiang 1989 National Tour Concert" lasted over half a year, with 62 performances in 12 cities, attracting over 600,000 audience members. Can you share your feelings about this?

Fei Xiang: My deepest feeling is the enthusiasm of the audience and the support from leaders at all levels. They have been very considerate towards me, and the audience no longer treats me as an outsider. Over the past three years, the audience and I have developed a deep bond. This tour has reached a certain standard, and I am very satisfied. In fact, I have invested a lot in this concert, from the content of the programs to the arrangement of songs, orchestration, and various behind-the-scenes work. Therefore, this concert is very representative and has poured in all my heart.

Q: During the recent farewell performance in Beijing, enthusiastic fans held up a banner that read, "Please don't say goodbye to your fans." You have been popular in mainland China for three years. I think it's not just your singing and dancing skills or your elegant demeanor that have attracted the audience for so long.

Fei Xiang: I think that performers, whether they are singers, movie stars, or writers, should not only convey emotions through their works but also have a sense of responsibility and dedication. This is very important. The support from the audience first requires artists to be responsible to the audience. I pay more attention to this aspect. The lifespan of popular music singers in mainland China is very short. Some singers fade away in just one season or even one year. I always feel that artists should overcome difficulties to maintain the quality of their works or performances, so that the audience's faith not only does not weaken but also grows stronger, always bringing something new, and not disappointing the audience.

The problem facing domestic singers is that the emotional pressure is particularly heavy. As soon as a singer becomes popular, the troupe treats him like a cash cow, dragging him out for every performance to attract the audience. It's like a tissue paper, used and then discarded. Moreover, the troupe does not maintain the artistic life of these talents, nor do they formulate long-term performance and training plans for them. They only care about immediate interests, squeezing them dry. This is a pity!

Now, the "hole-heads" (agents) during their "hole-digging" (performing) activities do not consider improving the quality of the performance, lighting, sound, and stage design at all. Because in such short-term activities, spending an extra penny means earning one less. They would rather let the singer perform on the concrete floor of a stadium, as long as they have a thick face. At that time, the audience will naturally blame the singer, not the "hole-head," so the singer's elimination rate will definitely be fast. I think on one hand, singers should firmly defend their rights, although sometimes they are really helpless; on the other hand, if various song and dance troupes can formulate long-term cultivation plans, it will be beneficial in all aspects.

The audience also does not hope that performers will decline. Every time I go on stage, I am actually quite nervous, but I always have an idea in my mind: the people here all hope that I will succeed tonight, and no one hopes that I will fail. With their support, I will definitely sing well.

Q: This time, you are bidding farewell to the mainland music scene. Can you leave a few words for your fans who love you?

Fei Xiang: On the last day of the farewell concert, I saw many audience members holding banners, and I was very moved, both happy and sad. The entire concert was quite good, but when I sang "Clouds of the Homeland," I couldn't hold back my tears and started to cry. I feel that this farewell is a farewell, but my three years of singing career in mainland China can be said to be very complete and perfect. No matter where I go in the future, whether to the United States or elsewhere, no matter how many failures or successes I encounter, I will always have this three-year experience that is very perfect and brilliant. I hope that my friends who support me and the audience who love me can cherish it.

I hope that when we meet again, it will be on the streets of Beijing, in a relaxed and pleasant manner. I will also come back often. I have family here, and I love Beijing very much. In the future, when people see me, it will be as a common citizen walking on the street, which would be great!

    为何这般流连？
    ——与费翔一席谈
    江德文
    问：“费翔1989全国巡回演唱会”历时半年多，在12个城市共演出62场，观众达60余万人。您能否谈一谈感受？
    费翔：我最深的感受是观众和国家各级领导对我的热情，非常照顾我，观众也不拿我当外人啦，三年来观众和我已经产生了很深的感情。这次巡演达到了一定的水准，我感到很满意。其实我对这台晚会投入也很多，从节目内容到歌曲编排、乐队编曲等各方面我都参加了好多幕后工作，所以说这台晚会是很有代表性的，它倾注了我全部的心血。
    问：在不久前的北京告别演出时，热心的歌迷打出了“请不要对你的歌迷说再见”的横幅。您在大陆走红已经三年，我想仅仅靠您的能歌善舞或举止潇洒来吸引观众，恐怕是不会这么长久的。
    费翔：我觉得演员与观众之间，不管是歌星、电影明星或是作家，他们不但应该有通过作品转达的一份感情，还应有一份责任，有一份责任心，这是很重要的。观众的支持首先需要艺术家对观众负责任，我比较注重这方面。大陆的流行音乐歌手的生命非常短，有的歌手一季，甚至一年就轰轰烈烈过去了。我总觉得艺术家应该克服困难以保持他的作品或演出的品质，使观众信念不但不逐渐衰弱，而且越来越产生信心，总有新的东西，不使观众失望。
    国内歌手面临的问题是人情压力特别重，只要一个歌手走红，团里就把他当摇钱树，每一个演出都要把他搬出来，拿他的名字吸引观众。就像一张纸巾，用完了就扔了。另外，团里没有维护这些人才的艺术生命，为他们制定长期的演出和训练规划，只顾眼前利益，挤干为止，这很可惜！
    现在的穴头们“走穴”时也根本不考虑把演出的质量、灯光音响舞美的制作搞好一些，因为在这种短暂的活动里
  多花一分钱就等于少赚一分钱，他们宁愿让歌星在体育馆的水泥地上唱，有一张厚脸皮就行。到时候观众骂的当然不是穴头，只会骂歌星，所以歌星的淘汰率必定快。我想一方面歌手应坚决维护自己的权益，不过有时他们真是身不由己；另一方面，各个歌舞团如果能制定长远培养规划，那各方面都有好处。
    观众也并不希望演员走下坡路，我每次上台其实都挺紧张，但我心里总是抱着一个想法：在座的人都希望我今晚会成功，没有一个人希望我失败，有他们的支持我定会唱好的。
    问：这次您要告别大陆歌坛，能不能给喜欢您的观众留下几句话？
    费翔：在最后一天的告别演唱会上，我看到许多观众拿着横幅我非常感动，既很开心又很难过。整个演唱会挺好的，就是唱“故乡的云”时有些绷不住了，开始想哭。我自己感觉告别是告别，但我这三年在大陆的歌唱事业应该说是非常完整、非常完美。不管以后我到美国或是到其它地方，不管将来有多少失败或成功，我都拥有这三年非常完美、非常光彩的经验。我希望支持我的朋友和喜欢我的观众也能珍惜它。
    我希望以后见面就是在北京街道上，很轻松愉快。我也会经常回来的，我这儿有家人，我非常喜欢北京，以后人家看到我就是以老百姓的身份在街上走，那多好！
