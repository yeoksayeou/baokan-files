Colombian President Barco on October 31 reiterated that his government will not engage in dialogue with drug traffickers and will not compromise with them.

Barco made these remarks during a memorial event for the country's security management bureau. He pointed out that the leaders of drug trafficking organizations are demanding dialogue with the government, not for peace, but to cover up their crimes, evade legal punishment, and continue their evil deeds.

He said that the Colombian people cannot coexist with these brutal drug traffickers.

Since the Colombian government launched an unprecedented large-scale anti-drug campaign in August this year, Colombian drug trafficking organizations have been fiercely counterattacking with terrorist methods while demanding dialogue with the government. In the past month, some figures in Colombia's political, media, and judicial circles have proposed that, to avoid more bloodshed and to prevent the anti-drug efforts from seriously affecting economic development, the government should consider negotiating with drug trafficking organizations.

The Colombian Judicial Workers' Union announced on November 2 that judicial workers across the country will begin a series of intermittent strikes starting immediately to protest the drug trafficking organizations' murders of judicial workers and to demand that the government take effective measures to protect their personal safety.

According to reports, 40 judges of the highest court in Colombia's second-largest city, Medellin, began a one-week strike on November 2 and announced that they would consider collective resignation.

In the past three months, as the drug trafficking organizations fiercely counterattacked the anti-drug campaign, they have already killed four judges and one prosecutor.

    哥司法人员罢工抗议贩毒集团暴行
    新华社北京电　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚总统巴尔科10月31日重申，他的政府决不和贩毒分子对话、决不向贩毒分子妥协。
    巴尔科今天在参加该国安全管理局的一次纪念活动中发表讲话时指出，贩毒集团头目要求与政府对话，他们并非是要和平，而是企图掩盖他们的罪行、逃避法律的惩罚和继续作恶。
    他说，哥伦比亚人民不能与那些残暴的贩毒分子相安共处。
    自今年8月哥伦比亚政府开展空前规模剿毒运动以来，哥伦比亚贩毒集团一面以恐怖手段进行疯狂反扑，一面要求与政府对话。最近一个多月，哥伦比亚政界、舆论界和司法界一些人士提出，为了避免更多的流血，避免因扫毒而严重影响经济发展，政府应考虑同贩毒集团谈判。
    新华社波哥大11月2日电哥伦比亚司法工作者联合会2日宣布，全国许多司法工作者从即日起开始一系列间歇性罢工，以抗议贩毒集团残杀司法工作者的暴行，要求政府采取有效措施保护他们的人身安全。
    据报道，哥第2大城市麦德林最高法庭的40名大法官2日起开始为期一周的罢工，并宣布将考虑集体辞职。
    最近3个月来，哥贩毒集团对剿毒运动疯狂反扑，已杀害4名大法官和一名检察官。
