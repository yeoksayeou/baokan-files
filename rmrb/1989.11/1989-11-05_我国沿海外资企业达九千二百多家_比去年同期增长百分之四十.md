Foreign-invested enterprises in China's coastal open cities and economic special zones have reached more than 9,200, a 40% increase over the same period last year, accounting for nearly half of the national total. This information was revealed at a recent seminar on the registration and management of foreign-invested enterprises in coastal open cities and economic special zones held in Ningbo.

Facing the rapid development of foreign-invested enterprises, officials responsible for the registration and management of foreign-invested enterprises from 14 coastal open cities, three economic special zones, and Hainan Province gathered in Ningbo. They discussed the experiences and practices in the registration and management of foreign-invested enterprises since the implementation of the "Provisions of the People's Republic of China on the Registration and Management of Enterprise Legal Persons" one year ago. They also explored new situations and problems that have emerged in the development of foreign-invested enterprises. They offered many valuable suggestions on formulating and improving regulations for the registration and management of foreign-invested enterprises, gradually making this work standardized and legalized. The meeting unanimously agreed that the issuance and implementation of the "Provisions" have changed the previous situation where the supervision and management of foreign-invested enterprises lacked legal basis.

    新华社宁波11月4日电  （通讯员王甬平）沿海开放城市、经济特区外商投资企业已达9200多家，比去年同期增长40％，约占全国总数的一半。这是最近在宁波结束的沿海开放城市、经济特区外资企业登记管理研讨会透露的信息。
    面对外资企业迅速发展的形势，全国14个沿海开放城市、三个经济特区和海南省负责外资企业登记管理的有关人士，在此间就《中华人民共和国企业法人登记管理条例》实施一年来外商投资企业登记管理工作的经验、做法，以及外商投资企业发展中出现的新情况、新问题进行了探讨。他们从多方面对制订和完善外商投资企业登记管理法规，使这项工作逐步规范化、法制化等问题，提出了许多有益的建议。会议一致认为，《条例》的颁发和实施，改变了过去外资企业监督管理无法可依的状况。
