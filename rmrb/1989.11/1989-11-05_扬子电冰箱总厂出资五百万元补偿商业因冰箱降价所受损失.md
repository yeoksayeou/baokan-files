Yangzi Refrigerator Factory Allocates 50 Million Yuan to Compensate Businesses for Losses Due to Price Reduction

DALIAN, Nov. 5 (Xinhua) -- The Yangzi Refrigerator Factory in Anhui Province has voluntarily allocated 50 million yuan to compensate commercial enterprises for economic losses incurred due to the price reduction of refrigerators.

The factory's decision to prioritize the overall situation over its own profits has been praised by representatives of commercial enterprises attending a recent business and industry friendship conference held in Dalian.

In May of this year, the Yangzi Refrigerator Factory was the first in the country to reduce prices for refrigerator sales. It then allocated 50 million yuan to subsidize stores with Yangzi refrigerators in stock.

This decision by the Yangzi Refrigerator Factory has won the trust of the commercial sector, leading to a continuous increase in orders. In the second half of this year, the factory received an additional 300,000 orders. Despite the general sluggishness in the refrigerator market, Yangzi refrigerators continue to be in high demand. So far, the factory has achieved sales of 220 million yuan, approximately 70% more than the total sales for the previous year.
