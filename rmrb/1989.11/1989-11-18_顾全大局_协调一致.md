The Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has clearly and specifically placed the tasks of further economic rectification and deepening reforms before the entire Party and the people of the nation. To successfully complete this arduous and heavy task, it is crucial to vigorously promote the spirit of considering the overall situation and coordinating efforts.

The Fifth Plenary Session pointed out that economic rectification must focus on four key aspects: first, continuing to reduce total demand; second, vigorously adjusting the industrial structure; third, seriously rectifying economic order; and fourth, deeply promoting the "double increase and double reduction" campaign. These four aspects are interrelated and inseparable, stemming from the fundamental requirements for sustained, stable, and coordinated economic development, and are proposed in response to current economic issues. In short, they are proposed based on the overall economic development and serve the overall economic development. Therefore, only by considering the overall situation can one deeply understand the necessity of focusing on these aspects; and only by establishing the idea of considering the overall situation can one consciously and firmly focus on these aspects and truly achieve results.

Economic rectification is essentially an economic adjustment. Since it is an adjustment, it necessarily involves progress and setbacks from a specific perspective. Some things need to go up, some need to go down; some need to be maintained, some need to be suppressed; some need to be strengthened and developed, while others need to be contracted and eliminated. Those industries, departments, and enterprises that need to go up, be maintained, strengthened, and developed undoubtedly need strong support and coordination from all sides considering the overall situation. However, these departments and units themselves should not rely on their importance, waiting for "bias," but should also make greater efforts to contribute more to the overall situation. For those departments and units that need to go down, be suppressed, contracted, and eliminated, economic rectification is like a bitter medicine. They need to endure some pain and pay a certain price, and thus need to establish the idea of considering the overall situation, consciously subordinating local interests to the overall interests.

The Party Central Committee and the State Council have always emphasized considering the overall situation and coordinating efforts, emphasizing the need to balance and coordinate the interests of the central government, local governments, enterprises, and individuals to mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties. Since the reform, various measures have been taken according to this principle, and good results have been achieved. However, in recent years, there has been a notable problem in the relationship of interests: some people's thoughts have seriously tilted towards local interests, emphasizing local interests more and overall interests less; emphasizing personal interests more and collective interests less. Some departments, regions, and units have seen the growth of localism and separatism. Phenomena such as market segmentation, procurement "battles," and "small squeezing big" in enterprises are also closely related to this. Therefore, it is necessary to clearly propose the idea of considering the overall situation in opposition to these tendencies, advocating that small matters should give way to big matters, and placing overall interests first, so that there can be a common language, and various measures for economic rectification and deepening reforms can be coordinated and implemented. Only by doing so can we unite and overcome difficulties to strive for the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of China's economy.

Recently, everyone has been seriously studying Jiang Zemin's National Day speech, thinking about how to adhere to the socialist direction of reform and opening up. For leaders, whether to establish an overall perspective and consider the overall situation in economic work, and whether to recognize the big picture, is actually an important aspect of adhering to the correct direction. We are engaged in socialist modernization economic construction. Modern economy is based on the broad division of labor and exchange throughout society. Every part is closely connected to the whole, and no one can develop in isolation from the whole. If the overall situation is not stable, even if there is local prosperity, it will not be sustainable. Economic life in recent years has repeatedly taught us this. Our reform and opening up aim to fully leverage the advantages of the socialist system to promote the development of social productive forces. One of the great advantages of China's socialist economy, which is dominated by public ownership, lies in its mechanism that includes the fundamental interests of the state, local governments, enterprises, and individuals. This is the economic basis for advocating the establishment of an overall perspective, and it also shows that establishing an overall perspective, considering the overall situation, and coordinating efforts are the keys to unlocking the vast potential of the socialist economic mechanism. Some comrades always oppose economic rectification with deepening reforms in their minds. In fact, from a certain perspective, economic reform is essentially about better coordinating the interests of all parties to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties; while economic rectification is also to rationalize various relationships and make the interests of all parties more coordinated. Looking at it this way, the connection and unity of the two become clear.

To complete the tasks of economic rectification and deepening reforms, it is undoubtedly necessary to follow economic laws and do practical work. At the same time, the political guarantee of economic work should not be ignored. Currently, strengthening the overall concept, advocating considering the overall situation, recognizing the big picture, coordinating efforts, and overcoming difficulties is both a requirement of economic work and an important content of ideological and political work. Distinguishing different objects and proposing different requirements, seriously grasping the ideological education of considering the overall situation is an important work that various levels of Party organizations cannot ignore in implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session and the entire process of economic rectification.

### 顾全大局　协调一致

    顾全大局　协调一致
    党的十三届五中全会，把进一步治理整顿、深化改革的任务，清晰、具体地摆在全党、全国人民面前。为了胜利地完成这一艰巨而繁重的任务，一个很重要的问题，就是一定要大力发扬顾全大局、协调一致的精神。
    五中全会指出，治理整顿必须抓住四个重要环节：一是继续压缩总需求量；二是大力调整产业结构；三是认真整顿经济秩序；四是深入开展双增双节运动。这四个环节有其不可分割的内在联系，是从持续、稳定、协调发展经济的根本要求出发，又针对当前经济生活中的问题提出来的。一句话，是根据经济发展全局提出来，又服务于经济发展全局的。因此，只有从全局出发，才能深入理解抓住这些环节的必要性；也只有树立顾全大局的思想，才可能自觉而坚定地抓住这些环节，并真正抓出实效来。
    治理整顿实质上是一次经济上的调整。既然是调整，从具体方面看，就必然有进有退。有的要上，有的要下；有的要保，有的要压；有的要加强、发展，有的要收缩、淘汰。那些要上、要保、要加强、要发展的行业、部门、企业，无疑需要各方面从全局出发的大力支持和协同。而这些部门和单位自身，则不能自恃重要，等待“倾斜”，同样需要作更大的努力，为全局作更大的贡献。对于要下、要压、要收缩、要淘汰的那些部门和单位来说，治理整顿犹如一剂“苦药”，它们要忍受一些苦痛，付出一定代价，这就更需要树立顾全大局的思想，自觉地以局部利益服从全局利益。
    党中央和国务院历来强调顾全大局、协调一致，强调要兼顾和协调中央、地方、企业、个人各方面的利益关系，以调动各方面的积极性。改革以来，也按照这个原则，采取了种种措施，并且收到了较好的效果。但是，这几年，也存在着一个很值得注意的问题：在利益关系上，包括某些人的思想上，发生了严重的倾斜。强调局部利益多，强调全局利益少；强调个人利益多，强调集体利益少。一些部门、地区、单位，本位主义、分散主义现象有所滋长。市场上的割据，收购上的“大战”，企业中的“以小挤大”等等怪现象，也都与此有密切关系。因此，必须鲜明地提出以顾全大局的思想与上述倾向相对立，提倡小道理服从大道理，把全局利益放在第一位，才可能有共同语言，才可能协调一致地落实治理整顿和深化改革的各项措施，团结一致，克服困难，去争取我国经济的持续、稳定、协调发展。
    近来，大家都在认真学习江泽民同志的国庆讲话，思考如何坚持改革开放的社会主义方向问题。对于领导者来说，在经济工作中，是否树立全局思想，能否顾大局，识大体，实际上是能否坚持正确方向的一个重要方面。我们进行的是社会主义现代化经济建设。现代化经济是建立在全社会广泛分工与交换基础之上的。每一局部都同全局紧密相连，谁也不可能离开全局孤立发展。全局稳不住，即使出现局部繁荣，也是不能持久的。近几年的经济生活已经一再这样教育我们。我们的改革开放，基本目的在于充分发挥社会主义制度的优越性，促进社会生产力的发展。而我国以公有制为主体的社会主义经济巨大优越性之一，就在于它含有国家、地方、企业、个人各方基本利益一致的机制。这正是我们提倡树立全局思想的经济基础，同时也说明，树立全局思想，顾全大局，协调一致，正是我们打开社会主义经济优越机制这一巨大能量宝库的一把钥匙。有的同志，在认识上总把治理整顿同深化改革对立起来。其实，从某种意义上说，经济改革无非是把各方面利益更好地协调起来，以充分调动各方面积极性；而治理整顿也是为了理顺各种关系使各方面利益更加协调。这样看两者的衔接和统一，便豁然开朗。
    为完成治理整顿、深化改革任务，无疑应该按照经济规律，扎扎实实做好工作。同时，也不可忽视经济工作的政治保证问题。当前，加强全局观念，提倡顾大局，识大体，协调一致，战胜困难，既是经济工作的要求，又是思想政治工作的重要内容。区分不同对象，提出不同要求，认真抓好顾全大局的思想教育，是各级党组织在贯彻五中全会精神以致整个治理整顿过程中不可忽视的一项重要工作。
