Authoritative figures predicted at the national non-ferrous metals advance procurement meeting for the first half of 1990 that the market for non-ferrous metals in 1990 will still see demand exceeding supply. This meeting was jointly organized by the Ministry of Materials and the China Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Corporation.

A responsible official from the Ministry of Materials analyzed the current situation of the non-ferrous metals market and pointed out that, overall, the supply of non-ferrous metals in China remains tight, with national demand still exceeding supply. He hoped that non-ferrous metal production enterprises would overcome difficulties and produce as much non-ferrous metals as possible. He expressed that the Ministry of Materials supports non-ferrous metal production and will help enterprises through tough times. If there is a surplus, the materials department will assist in sales or have the state purchase and store the metals.

The meeting also revealed that the import of non-ferrous metals in 1990 will be reduced compared to this year. Therefore, the meeting emphasized that the supply of non-ferrous metals should, under the premise of stabilizing production, appropriately increase the proportion of planned economy; strengthen the seriousness of the directive plan and the discipline of executing the plan, strictly execute the policy of prioritizing planned procurement over non-planned procurement, and vigorously promote production and savings, while restricting unreasonable consumption.

The signing of planned contracts at the meeting was relatively smooth, but there were many difficulties in executing the contracts, and both supply and demand sides expressed concerns. Non-planned contracts decreased compared to previous procurement meetings, and most of the signed contracts were for small, sporadic orders. Some products, especially aluminum, which was in high demand last year, began to show signs of a buyer's market.

　　权威人士预测明年市场形势
　　有色金属供应仍将趋紧
    本报讯　一九九○年上半年全国有色金属预拨订货会上，权威人士预测：一九九○年有色金属市场仍呈需求大于供给之势。这次会议是由物资部、中国有色金属工业总公司联合举办的。
    物资部负责人分析了目前有色金属市场的形势后指出，总的看，我国有色金属供应仍趋紧张，全国有色金属市场仍然需大于供；希望有色金属生产企业克服困难，千方百计多生产有色金属。他表示物资部支持有色金属生产，共渡难关。如果出现滞销，物资部门要帮助企业推销，或者由国家收购储备。
    会议还透露：一九九○年有色金属进口将比今年减少。为此会议强调，有色金属的供应工作要在稳定生产的前提下，适当增加计划经济的比例；加强指令性计划的严肃性和执行计划的纪律性，不折不扣地执行先计划内后计划外的方针，大力增产节约，限制不合理消费。
    会上计划合同的签订情况较好，但执行合同困难不少，供需双方对此表示忧虑。计划外合同较之往届订货会有所减少，且签订的多是小宗、零星订货，一些产品尤其是去年俏销的铝开始出现买方市场。（朱红）
