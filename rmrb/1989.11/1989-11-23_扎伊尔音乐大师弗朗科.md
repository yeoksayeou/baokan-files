After 30 years on the music scene, Zaire's most famous singer and music master Franco passed away on October 12 in Brussels, at the age of 51. The news spread, and many Africans wept for him. President Mobutu immediately declared a national day of mourning.

Franco is known as the "Balzac of the African music world," and everyone affectionately calls him "Master Franco." His original name was Luambo Makiadi. He changed his name to "Franco" after entering the arts. He was born on July 28, 1938, in Zaire. At the age of 10, he lost his father, and due to his family's poverty, his mother supported the family by selling fried snacks. Little Luambo was very intelligent and witty, and he loved to sing from a young age, often sitting by his mother's snack stand, using his voice to attract customers. As he grew up, he began performing in a bar in Kinshasa and, together with some young people, formed a band. His talent and diligence quickly made him famous. In 1953, at the age of 15, Franco recorded his first album.

Franco is the founder of Zaire's "Rumba" music. He skillfully combined African folk music and traditional music with jazz and swing music, taking the best of both, and created a new kind of music. When Franco performed, he always played a specially made large guitar, singing and dancing at the same time. His voice was sometimes soft and tender, sometimes passionate and powerful; his dance moves were beautiful and natural, with a hidden elegance. Therefore, he always had a magical charm that attracted the audience. He recorded more than a hundred albums. In the 1960s, his songs "True" and "African Dance," in the 1970s, "AZDA," "20th Anniversary of Mabere," "Respect," "Bimansa," "Tailor," and "Mondo," and in the 1980s, "Mario," constituted the main stages of his musical career. Many famous African singers, such as Mory Kanté and Papa Wemba, were either influenced by him or directly learned from him. Because of Franco's outstanding contributions to the creation and development of Zairean music, in 1978, President Mobutu awarded him the honorable title of "Zairean Music Master." In the early 1980s, he resided in Belgium and often performed in Brussels, Paris, and other European capital cities. It was only because he fell seriously ill two years ago that he retired from the music scene. In his fight against the disease, he remained very optimistic. Until shortly before his death, he said, "I will sing until the year 2000."

A giant star of the African music world has fallen, but the musical wealth he brought will remain forever. (Photo attached)

　　扎伊尔音乐大师弗朗科
　　本报记者　杨汝生
    在乐坛驰骋了30个春秋之后，扎伊尔最有名的歌手、音乐大师弗朗科10月12日在布鲁塞尔辞世，年仅51岁。消息传来，许多非洲人为之悲泣，蒙博托总统当即决定举行全国哀悼。
    弗朗科被誉为非洲乐坛的“巴尔扎克”，人们都亲切地称呼他“弗朗科大师”。他原名叫吕昂博·马基阿迪，从艺后才改为“弗朗科”，1938年7月28日出生在扎伊尔。10岁那年丧父，因家境贫困，母亲靠卖炸甜食维持全家生计。小吕昂博十分聪慧机敏，自幼喜欢唱歌，常常坐在母亲的甜食摊旁，用歌声吸引顾客。他长大后，开始在金沙萨的一个酒吧里演唱，并与一些青年人合伙，成立了一个乐队。天资和勤奋很快使他扬名，1953年，弗朗科15岁时灌制了自己的第一张唱片。
    弗朗科是扎伊尔“伦巴乐”的创始人。他把非洲的乡间音乐和传统音乐与爵士乐曲和摇摆乐曲巧妙地结合在一起，兼收二者之长，创造一种全新的音乐。弗朗科演出时，总是弹奏着特制的大吉他，边歌边舞。他的歌声时而柔和缠绵，时而激越豪壮；他的舞姿优美自然，拙中藏秀。因而，他总有一种吸引听众的神奇魅力。他共灌制了一百多张唱片。60年代，他演唱的“真实”、“非洲之舞”，70年代的“AZDA”、“马贝雷20周年”、“崇敬”、“比芒莎”、“缝衣工”和“蒙多拉”以及80年代的“马里奥”等，构成了他整个音乐生涯的几个主要阶段。许多非洲有名的歌手，如莫里·康泰、帕帕·旺巴等不是受过他的影响便是直接师承于他。由于弗朗科在创立和发展扎伊尔音乐方面作出突出贡献，1978年蒙博托总统曾授予他“扎伊尔音乐大师”的光荣称号。80年代初他侨居比利时，经常在布鲁塞尔、巴黎和欧洲其他国家的首都演出。只是因为两年前身患重病，他才退出乐坛。在与病魔进行的斗争中，他十分乐观。直到去世前不久他还说，“我要唱到2000年”。
    非洲乐坛的一颗巨星陨落了，但他带来的音乐财富却永留人间。（附图片）
