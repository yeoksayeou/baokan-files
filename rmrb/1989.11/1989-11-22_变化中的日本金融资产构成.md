In recent years, with the development of financial liberalization, the composition of Japan's financial assets has shown a trend towards securitization, with people increasingly inclined to invest in high-yielding stocks, bonds, and other securities, while traditional bank deposits have relatively decreased. However, since last year, this trend has reversed. According to statistics from the Bank of Japan's "Personal Savings Statistics," as of September this year, the proportion of personal savings in Japan invested in securities such as trust investments, bond investments, and stock investments has decreased from 2.1% last year to 1.5%. In contrast, the proportion of personal deposits has increased from 4.2% last year to 5.8%, and the proportion of insurance has also increased from 3.3% last year to 3.9%.

The main reasons for this change in the composition of Japan's financial assets are:

1. The impact of interest rate liberalization. With the implementation of interest rate liberalization in Japan, Japanese banks have successively introduced transferable deposits, market interest rate-linked deposits, and large-denomination time deposits, among other freely priced financial instruments. These financial instruments, with their relatively high interest rates, have attracted a large number of customers and funds.

2. The impact of inflation. Since April this year, due to the depreciation of the yen and the implementation of the consumption tax system by the Takeshita Noboru government, market prices in Japan have generally risen. According to the Bank of Japan's "Monthly Price Index Report," from January to September this year, Japan's wholesale and retail prices have risen by 3% compared to the same period last year, with some commodities experiencing significant price increases. The rise in inflation has made people more inclined to invest idle funds in high-yielding bank deposits with free interest rates.

3. The impact of stock market volatility. After the global stock market crash in October 1987, although Japan's securities market quickly stabilized, people remained cautious about investing in stocks, bonds, and other securities, adopting a more conservative approach to minimize investment risks.

　　变化中的日本金融资产构成
　　李言赋
    近年来，随着金融自由化的发展，日本的金融资产构成出现了证券化趋势，即人们趋向于将资金投向具有较高收益的股票、债券等有价证券，传统的银行存款等却相对减少。但自去年以来，这种趋势却发生了逆向变化。据日本银行的统计资料《个人储蓄统计》，截止到今年9月，日本的个人储蓄余额中，信托投资、债券投资和股票投资等有价证券投资所占的比率从去年同期的2.1％下降为1.5％，而个人存款所占的比率却从去年同期的4.2％上升为5.8％，保险所占的比率也从去年同期的3.3％上升为3.9％。
    导致日本金融资产构成发生这种变化的原因主要是：
    1、利率自由化的影响。随着日本利率自由化的推行，日本的银行业相继推出了可转让存款、市场利率连动型存款和大额定期存款等自由利率的金融工具。这些金融工具因具有较高利率而吸引了大量客户和大量资金。
    2、通货膨胀的影响。今年4月以来，由于日元汇率下跌和竹下登政府实施消费税制度，日本的市场物价普遍上涨。据日本银行的《物价指数月报》，从今年1月到9月，日本的批发物价和零售物价分别比去年同期上涨了3％，个别商品的价格还发生了大幅度上涨。通货膨胀的抬头使人们更愿意将闲置资金投向自由利率存款等具有较高收益的银行存款。
    3、股市动荡的影响。1987年10月世界性股市暴跌后，日本的有价证券市场虽平静较快，但人们对股票、债券等有价证券投资却心有余悸，采取了比较谨慎的态度，以尽量减少投资风险。
