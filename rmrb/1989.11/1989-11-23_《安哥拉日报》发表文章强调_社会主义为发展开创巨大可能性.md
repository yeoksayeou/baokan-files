The Angolan Daily recently published an article titled "Is Socialism in Crisis or Developing?" The article emphasizes that although socialism faces difficulties, it has opened up vast possibilities for development and will demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system over capitalism. The following is a translated excerpt:

Due to the actual situation in socialist countries, the most reactionary elements in the West have distorted and spread false information, sometimes even claiming that socialism as a system is in crisis and that socialism itself is unworkable.

Of course, the socialist system has encountered enormous difficulties. However, it cannot be conclusively said that socialism as a system is less correct than capitalism, despite the many mistakes it has made. We should remember that it was through socialism that the liberation of the peoples of the world first broke through, making it possible to eliminate colonialism and grant independence to over 100 former colonies.

Recently, capitalists and extreme nationalists have hoped for the collapse of socialism and asserted that the socialist system will disappear.

In fact, socialism has already been established on Earth. Time has clearly shown that socialism has opened up vast possibilities for development.

Understanding the difficulties and problems of the 1970s and 1980s does not mean that socialism as a social system is in some kind of crisis. On the contrary, the crisis is the result of the following situations: not acting completely in accordance with principles; misinterpreting, or even distorting, principles; retaining certain measures taken under the initial historical conditions of the development of the socialist system but which are no longer applicable today.

Socialism is a science that leads with the correct methods, selfless examples, and always represents the most fundamental aspirations of the people. Therefore, the difficulties that arise in the development of socialist countries obviously cannot be attributed to the socialist system, but rather to the mistakes of the ruling party in assessment and leadership.

However, the reforms currently underway are not a retreat for socialism, but a step forward towards restoring what has been lost, better utilizing resources, potential, and the superiority of the system. Meanwhile, the extreme elements and most reactionary individuals in the West have been encouraging capitalist tendencies that have emerged during the reforms in socialist countries. The difficulties and problems faced by socialist countries have given rise to the illusion among the most reactionary classes in the West that socialism will disappear tomorrow and that they dream of one day re-colonizing our countries.

It has been observed that in socialist countries, reforms have not yet achieved great results, but they have already shown signs of effectiveness internationally. In particular, due to these reforms, diplomacy has been able to break free from past dogmatic ways of thinking, thus allowing the spirit of dialogue to prevail over confrontation. In this atmosphere, countries with different political and economic systems have deepened their understanding and strengthened their exchanges over the past few years, which has enabled humanity, facing urgent problems, to make significant progress towards the future.

Today, looking at socialism as a young social system, it has the great potential to perfect itself and solve the fundamental problems of the current spiritual, cultural, economic, scientific, and technological development of society, as well as the changes in human personality.

It is up to socialism to demonstrate and convince people of the benefits it brings to the peoples of all countries and the entire international community. From this practical standpoint, socialist countries recognize their responsibility and the historical role they play, thus beginning great reforms. These reforms will be able to better utilize resources and potential, and demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system over capitalism.

The current reforms are being actively undertaken and taken responsibility for by the ruling parties, fully reflecting the maturity of these parties. They acknowledge that in this complex moment of world development, the socialist system must fully demonstrate the vitality of its political-economic system, as well as a more democratic and humane way of life.

The central purpose of the ongoing reforms is to raise the socialist system to a higher level in terms of quality, for the welfare of the peoples of all countries in the world.

### 《安哥拉日报》发表文章强调　社会主义为发展开创巨大可能性

　　《安哥拉日报》发表文章强调
　　社会主义为发展开创巨大可能性
    本报讯　安哥拉《安哥拉日报》不久前刊登了一篇题为《社会主义陷入危机，还是在发展？》的文章，强调社会主义虽遇到困难，但它为发展开创了巨大可能性，将显示出社会主义制度比资本主义优越。文章摘译如下：
    由于社会主义国家的实际情况，西方最反动的人士歪曲地传播有关情况和消息，有时甚至断言，社会主义作为制度处于危机之中和社会主义本身是行不通的。
    当然，社会主义制度是遇到了巨大困难。但是不能断然地说社会主义作为制度不如资本主义正确，尽管它犯过很多错误。我们应该记住，由于社会主义，世界各国人民的解放才有了第一次突破，才有可能消灭殖民主义和使100多个前殖民地获得独立。
    最近资本主义先生们和民族极端分子希望社会主义瓦解，并且断言社会主义制度将消失。
    事实上，社会主义已在地球上确立。时间清楚地表明社会主义为发展开创了巨大的可能性。
    理解70年代和80年代的困难和问题，并不表明社会主义作为社会制度处于某种危机，而是相反，危机是下述情况造成的结果：没有完全按照原则行事；曲解、甚至歪曲原则；保留在社会主义制度发展最初历史条件下采取但现在已不适用的某些措施。
    社会主义是以正确的方法、克己的榜样和永远代表人民群众最根本愿望的方式进行领导的科学。因此，社会主义国家发展中出现的困难显然不能归咎于社会主义制度，而应归咎于执政党在估计和领导方面的错误。
    但是，正在进行的变革，对于社会主义来说不是倒退，而是朝着恢复失去的东西，更好地利用资源、潜力和制度的优越性方向前进。与此同时，西方的极端分子和最反动的人士一直在鼓励社会主义国家在进行改革中出现的资本主义倾向。社会主义国家面临的困难和问题使西方最反动的阶层产生幻想，认为明天社会主义将会消失，并梦想有朝一日将重新对我们各国进行殖民统治。
    人们注意到，在社会主义国家中，改革尚未取得巨大成果，但是已在国际上显示出有成效的迹象。特别是由于这些改革，使得外交能够摆脱过去教条的思想方法，从而使对话精神压倒了对抗。在这种气氛中，政治和经济制度不同的国家之间最近几年加深了了解和加强了交往，这使面临紧迫问题的人类在面向未来时取得了重大进展。
    今天，从社会主义是一种年轻的社会制度来看，它具有自我完善和解决社会当前的精神、文化、经济和科学技术发展，以及人类个性变化方面基本问题的巨大可能性。
    应由社会主义表明和使人信服它给各国人民和整个国际社会带来的好处，从这种实际出发，社会主义国家认识到自己的责任和承担的历史作用，从而开始了伟大的变革，这种变革将能够更好地利用资源和潜力，并且显示出社会主义制度比资本主义优越。
    目前的改革是执政党主动采取和承担责任的，这充分地反映了这些党的成熟，承认在当前世界发展的复杂时刻，社会主义制度必须充分显示其政治—经济体制的活力，以及更民主和人道的生活方式。
    正在进行的改革的中心目的是，使社会主义制度在质的方面，为了全世界各国人民的福利，达到更高的水平。
