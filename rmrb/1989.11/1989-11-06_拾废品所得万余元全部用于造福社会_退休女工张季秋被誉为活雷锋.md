	Retired Worker Zhang Jiuqiu Donates Over 10,000 Yuan from Collecting Waste to Society
	Retired Worker Zhang Jiuqiu Honored as a Living Lei Feng

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, November 5th (Reporter Zhao Su) Communist Party member and retired worker Zhang Jiuqiu has donated all 13,000 yuan she earned from collecting waste to society, earning her the title of a "living Lei Feng."

	Zhang Jiuqiu is 57 years old this year. She is from Hunan and worked as a pump operator at the Shanxi Chemical Factory before retiring. She has been collecting waste for over a decade. Before retiring, she mainly used her time before and after work and during lunch breaks to collect used cotton yarn and gloves from the factory, clean and dry them for reuse. This not only saved the factory from having to issue new cotton yarn and gloves but also provided the factory's trade union with over 1,000 yuan for activities.

	After retiring in 1985, Zhang Jiuqiu decided to fully dedicate herself to collecting waste. Every day, she would search through garbage piles in the factory area and alleys for iron wires, plastic waste, cardboard, cement bags, and old ropes, and sell them to waste recycling stations.

	Over the years, Zhang Jiuqiu has earned a considerable income from collecting waste. However, she has not kept a single cent for herself. Instead, she has used all the money to support national construction and benefit society. She has donated to the Great Khingan fire zone, the Red Cross blood donation center, the rescue of giant pandas, the frontlines of the Old Mountain, and the earthquake-stricken areas of Datong and Yanggao. To help restore the Great Wall, she has donated a total of 500 yuan in four installments. The amount she has donated to support families of revolutionary martyrs, impoverished households, colleagues, and neighbors is countless. Once, she encountered a mentally ill woman wandering the streets and took her to a bathhouse, cleaning her thoroughly and providing her with new clothes. She also brought her hot noodles with eggs from home and gave her blankets to keep warm at night, taking care of her for over half a month. The "blood and sweat money" she earned from the waste piles has even reached the hands of African refugees across the border.

    拾废品所得万余元全部用于造福社会
    退休女工张季秋被誉为活雷锋
    据新华社太原11月5日电  （记者赵苏）共产党员、退休女工张季秋，把自己拾废品所得的1.3万多元收入，全部用于造福社会，被人们誉为当代“活雷锋”。
    张季秋今年57岁，湖南人，退休前为山西省化工厂水泵工。她拾废品已坚持十几年，退休前主要是利用班前班后和午休时间，把厂里用过的废棉纱、废手套拾起来，洗净晒干再用，这样不但车间不用再领新棉纱、新手套，还为车间工会提供了1000多元活动经费。
    1985年退休后，张季秋索性干起了拾废品的行当。她每天在厂区和街巷的垃圾堆里把铁丝头、废塑料、草板纸、水泥袋、烂绳头等一切可以利用的废物拣回来，交给废品回收站。
    十几年来，张季秋拾废品有了可观的收入，然而她却不动分文，把钱全部用来支援国家建设，造福社会。大兴安岭火灾区、红十字献血站、抢救大熊猫、老山前线、大同阳高地震区，都有她的捐款。为了早日修复长城，她先后4次捐款共500元。资助烈军属、困难户、工友、邻里的钱就难以计数了。有一次她遇到一位流落街头的女精神病患者，就把她领到浴池，为她洗去满身污秽，给她换上新买的衣服，从家里给她端来热腾腾的鸡蛋挂面汤，晚上把家里的被子拿来给她御寒，就这样一直照顾了半个多月。她从废品堆里扒出的“血汗钱”，还飞过国界，到了非洲灾民手中。
