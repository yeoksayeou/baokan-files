In mid-October, a unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet presented a gold plaque inscribed with "Auspicious Wild Geese" to the Tibetan postman Pu Bu. Pu Bu, a postman on the Yadong line in Tibet, has been delivering mail between the Himalayan snow peaks for ten years.

Nefeila and Delila checkpoints are at an altitude of 4,700 meters. Previously, soldiers at the checkpoints could only receive newspapers and letters after the snow melted, calling them "quarterly publications." Since the local post office decided to establish a mail point at the checkpoints, the 21-year-old Pu Bu has been carrying the heavy mailbag. In the summer, he braves hail and rain, and in the winter, he crawls through snow up to his waist, enduring numerous winters and summers without ever missing the mail delivery time.

One day in May this year, the postal service received 15 urgent telegrams and express letters from the mainland to several checkpoints. At that time, a heavy snowstorm had just hit, and the back road was blocked. The 18-kilometer mountain road had 23 landslides, and the 15-kilometer section was covered with 1.8 meters of snow. The leaders repeatedly advised him to delay the trip, but Pu Bu insisted on delivering the mail to the checkpoints on time. Thus, he and another Tibetan postman, Ba San Ciren, stepped into the waist-deep snow, using walking sticks to carefully make their way forward. When hungry, they ate snow and tsampa; when tired, they lay down in the snow to catch their breath. They set out at 6 a.m. and finally arrived at the checkpoints at 11 p.m., delivering the mail to the soldiers.

Over the past 10 years, Pu Bu has delivered more than 300,000 pieces of mail to the checkpoints. Whenever Pu Bu's figure appears in the distance on the snowy plains, the soldiers who have been waiting at the checkpoints rush out to welcome the exhausted Pu Bu, wrapping him in a fur coat and carrying him up to the checkpoint.

    雪山“鸿雁”
    马甫超　冯中友
    10月中旬的一天，驻西藏的解放军某部把一块写有“吉祥鸿雁”字的金匾送给藏族乡邮员普布。西藏亚东线上的乡邮员普布在喜马拉雅高山雪岭之间穿行送邮，至今已有10个年头了。
    乃非拉、德里拉哨卡海拔4700米，哨卡官兵过去只有等到雪山解冻后才能收到报纸和信件，战士们把报纸、家信叫“季刊”。自从当地邮局决定建立哨卡邮点起，21岁的普布就背起了沉甸甸的邮袋。夏季他顶着冰雹暴雨，冬季在齐腰深的雪地里爬行上山，历经数个寒暑，从未误过送邮时间。
    今年5月的一天，邮电局同时收到从内地发往几个哨卡的15封加急电报和快件信，当时正值一场暴雪降临，后山道被堵。18公里的山路有23处塌方，15公里的路段积雪1.8米厚，领导再三劝阻，提出适当推迟上山，普布坚决表示一定要按时把邮件送上哨卡。于是，他同一名藏族邮递员巴桑次仁一起踩着齐腰深的积雪，拄着拐杖，一步步艰难地在雪地上摸索着前进，饿了吞一把积雪吃一口糌粑，累了躺在雪地上喘几口气，就这样从早晨6点出发到晚上11点，终于把一件件邮件，送到了官兵手里。
    10年来，普布共为哨卡送邮30万余件。每当远远的雪地上出现普布的身影时，早已等候在哨卡的战士们，纷纷扑入雪原，欢呼着迎接精疲力尽的普布，为他裹上皮大衣，将他抬上哨卡。
