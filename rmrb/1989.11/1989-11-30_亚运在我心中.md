Among the hundreds of donation ceremonies for the Asian Games, the personal donation symposium held today (29th) in the simple activity room of the Organizing Committee was the simplest and most moving. Ordinary people, including elderly men and women, workers, farmers, and students, donated money they had saved from their daily lives to the Asian Games. They donated not just money, but a fervent desire to bring glory to the nation and a sincere patriotic heart. Vice Mayor Zhang Baifa was moved to the point of bowing to the crowd, and Vice Secretary-General Liu Yuling of the Asian Games Organizing Committee repeatedly bowed to the attendees.

The Wish of a 91-Year-Old
The 91-year-old Ms. Wang Xuzhen donated 1,000 yuan she had saved over many years to the Asian Games. However, due to a leg injury, she could not attend the donation ceremony and instead sent 70-year-old Zhang Huichun as her representative. Ms. Zhang said that the old lady asked her to speak on her behalf, expressing her joy and that the 1,000 yuan was merely a token of her heartfelt intentions. Ms. Wang Xuzhen said that the Asian Games are a significant event for the revitalization of China, and Chinese women also have a responsibility. Though she is old and cannot contribute much, she hopes to donate her savings to the Asian Games and do her part. She would be very happy if she could see China host the first Asian Games next year.

Vice Mayor Zhang Baifa happily told everyone that next year, tickets for the opening ceremony will definitely be reserved for these donors, allowing them to share in the joy and honor.

Adding Half a Brick Even If You Can't Add a Tile
The vegetable farmer Ju Ronghua from Xihuang Village in Shijingshan District donated 1,000 yuan to the Asian Games. She said that she heard the Asian Games needed money to build venues, so she donated some of her earnings from selling vegetables. Even if she couldn't add a tile, she could add half a brick. Her words sparked a round of applause, with everyone agreeing that she spoke the truth.

An old worker, Yang Changshan, who once worked on the same construction site as Vice Mayor Zhang Baifa, donated money he had saved for building a house to the Asian Games. He said, "I am a construction worker and know the difficulties of a construction site being short of money. Let's prioritize the Asian Games, and the house can wait. We old workers understand, without the country, how can there be a home?" Yang Changshan, who hadn't seen Zhang Baifa in 30 years, was particularly affectionate when they met at the donation ceremony. The tricycle worker Fang Tianlu often rides his tricycle to observe the Asian Games construction site in the northern suburbs. Seeing the magnificent venues rising from the ground, he was filled with indescribable joy. He saved money from drinking and buying cigarettes to donate to the Asian Games, hoping the venues would be even more beautiful. A carpenter from Tongxian, Wang Zefang, donated 10,000 yuan saved by his entire family to the Asian Games. Ma Yanjun, who self-funded his studies in Japan, remembered the Asian Games construction site starting when he left the country. He often thought about the Asian Games and donated 100,000 yen he had saved from part-time work to the Asian Games. He said, "All descendants of the Yellow Emperor care about the Asian Games, and a student studying abroad is even more concerned about the motherland. My money is not much, it is saved from part-time work, but it is a token of my heart for the Asian Games."

The Torch of the Young Pioneers is Burning
The smallest donation today came from the entire Young Pioneers team of Class 42, Huai Shuling Primary School in Fengtai District, totaling 44.22 yuan. However, this donation was the most touching. The fundraising department staff members were moved to tears as they counted the coins. Vice Secretary-General Liu Yuling read the letter from the Young Pioneers on the spot. The letter read: "Uncles and Aunts, the slogan 'Asia Games for national glory, I add luster to the Asia Games' echoes in our minds. Our entire team of Young Pioneers had a heated discussion. We wanted to participate in voluntary labor, but it was too far away. After much discussion, we decided to save money from buying picture books, snacks, and stationery to donate to the Asia Games, contributing our modest efforts. Our team donated 39.22 yuan, plus 5 yuan from our instructor, totaling 44.22 yuan. Please transfer this money to the Asia Games command center. We hope!"

The Asia Games have become a new and powerful cohesive force in the hearts of the children and in the hearts of everyone, becoming a strong call for the revitalization of China.

　　“亚运在我心中”
　　本报记者　黄振中
    在数百次亚运会捐赠仪式中，今天（29日）在组委会简易活动房子里举行的个人捐赠座谈会是最简单最激动的一次。老大爷、老大妈和工人、农民、学生……这些普普通通的人，将他们平时省吃俭用节约下来的钱捐给亚运会。他们捐出的不仅仅是钱，而是一片为国争光的热情，是一颗赤诚的爱国之心。张百发副市长感动得向大家行礼，亚运会组委会副秘书长刘玉令连连向与会者鞠躬。
              九十一岁老人的心愿
    91岁的王绪贞老人，将几十年省下来的一千块钱捐给亚运会。可是，她因腿摔伤，不能前来参加捐赠仪式，特委托70岁的张惠秋作代表。张大娘说：老太太叫我在会上替她说几句，她很高兴，捐一千元仅仅是表示一点心意。王绪贞老人讲，亚运会是振兴中华的大事，咱们中国妇女也有责任，年纪大了，别的事出不了力，把自己省出的钱贡献给亚运会，尽点心。明年我能看到中国第一次举办亚洲盛会，太幸福了。
    张百发副市长高兴地告诉大家，明年一定要留出开幕式的票给这些捐赠者，让他们共尝欢乐和荣誉。
          添不了一块瓦也要加半块砖
    石景山区西黄村菜农朱荣花向亚运会捐了一千元钱，她说，听说亚运会建场馆钱紧，咱献上点卖菜钱，添不了一块瓦，也添半块砖。这位菜农的话，激起一片掌声，都说讲得实在。
    当年和张百发副市长同在工地上劳动的老工人杨长山把自己省出来盖房子的钱捐给亚运会。他说，咱是建筑工人，知道工地缺钱的难处，先急亚运会用，房子可后盖。咱老工人心里明白，没有国，哪有家呀。老工人杨长山30年未见到张百发，两人在捐赠会上相见分外亲切。三轮车工人方天禄近日经常蹬车观看北郊亚运会工地，看到拔地而起的宏伟场馆心里有说不出的高兴，把喝酒买烟的钱省下来捐亚运会，让场馆建得更漂亮。通县的一位木工王泽芳把全家省下的一万元钱也捐给亚运会。自费到日本留学的马燕民，出国时，亚运会工地破土动工，他经常惦记着亚运会，把勤工俭学省下来的十万日元捐给亚运会。他说：炎黄子孙都会关心亚运会，一个在国外读书的人更是常常想祖国。我的钱不多，是勤工俭学省下的，作为一片心献给亚运会。
                少先队的火炬在燃烧
    今天捐款最少的是丰台区槐树岭小学四二中队全体少先队员，总共44元2角2分。可是这笔捐款最感人。集资部工作人员数着这一角角一分分的赠款时，眼眶飞出泪花。副秘书长刘玉令当场向大家念了少先队员们的信。信是这样写的：叔叔阿姨们……“亚运为国争光，我为亚运添光彩”的口号，时时回荡在我们脑海，我们中队全体少先队员展开了热烈的讨论。去参加义务劳动，可是太远了。你一言我一语，最后决定把买画片、买零食，以及节省下来的买文具的钱攒起来，捐助亚运会，尽一点微薄之力。中队共捐39.22元，加上辅导员老师捐的5元钱，共计44.22元。请你们将这些钱转给亚运会指挥部，是盼！”
    亚运会在孩子们的心田里，在每一个人的心中，成为新的强大凝聚力，成为振兴中华的强音。
