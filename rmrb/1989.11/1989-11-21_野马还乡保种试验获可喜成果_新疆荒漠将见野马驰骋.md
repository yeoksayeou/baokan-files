A scientific experiment to save the nearly extinct wild horse, which involves returning captive wild horses to their native land in Xinjiang and then releasing them into the wild after a period of enclosure, has achieved encouraging results after five years of unremitting efforts by scientific and technical personnel. Currently, 13 returned wild horses have already reproduced 12 offspring, showing significantly improved physical condition and gradually recovering their wild nature.

Wild horses, as large and precious hoofed animals unique to the deserts and Gobi of the Asian interior, had already disappeared from the wilderness more than a decade ago. Five years ago, the State Forestry Administration imported 11 Przewalski's horses from Britain and East Germany and sent them to Xinjiang. A 2.56 square kilometer enclosure was built on a wasteland at the southern edge of the Junggar Basin in Xinjiang to raise these horses. Over the past five years, the scientific and technical personnel and breeders at this center have conducted detailed observations and studies on various behaviors of the wild horses and treated common diseases. This has helped the wild horses gradually adapt to the harsh conditions of the Gobi desert and move towards a wild life. However, due to long-term human "interference," the domesticated wild horses still retain a strong "domestic" flavor: they have a single diet and are unable to engage in high-intensity running, etc. The wilding process still requires long-term arduous efforts. The person in charge of the breeding center said that they plan to achieve the goal of releasing all wild horses into the wild by the end of the century.

### 野马还乡保种试验获可喜成果　新疆荒漠将见野马驰骋

　　野马还乡保种试验获可喜成果
　　新疆荒漠将见野马驰骋
    本报乌鲁木齐11月20日电　记者曾坤报道：一项拯救濒临灭绝的野马的科学试验，即把舍饲野马放归故乡新疆，进行围栏圈养然后放野，经过科技人员5年的不懈努力，已经取得可喜成果。目前13匹返乡野马已繁衍后代12匹，体质明显增强，野性逐步恢复。
    野马作为亚洲腹地荒漠戈壁特有的大型珍贵有蹄动物，早在十几年前已在荒原上失去踪迹。5年前，国家林业部从英国、民主德国引入11匹普氏野马送往新疆，并在新疆准噶尔盆地南缘一片荒原上，建起2.56平方公里的围栏饲养中心。5年来，这个中心的科技人员和饲养工人，对野马的各种行为进行了细致的观察研究，对常见病进行了调治，为野马逐步适应险恶的戈壁荒原的野生生活，向前迈进了一步。由于长期人的“包办代替”，驯养野马“家”味仍然十足：食草品种单一，无力进行大运动量的奔跑等等。野化工作仍需长期艰苦努力。饲养中心负责人称，将于本世纪末实现全部野马放野计划。
