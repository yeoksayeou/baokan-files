The province of Gansu, which had experienced several ups and downs in its economic development before the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, has correctly learned from historical experiences and lessons. In the process of developing the economy and changing the face of poverty, Gansu has established a long-term spirit of hard work and entrepreneurship. It has paid attention to difficulties while actively seeking progress, striving for steady development, and promoting the steady progress of various construction projects in the province.

The main indicators of this significant change are:

Agricultural production has increased for seven consecutive years, with an average annual growth rate of over 5%. Among these, grain production has increased for seven consecutive years, which is particularly noteworthy. According to statistics, the province's total grain production increased from 46.9 billion kilograms in 1982 to 59.3 billion kilograms last year. This year, it reached a new historical high of 62.5 billion kilograms.

The industrial development speed is relatively moderate. Over the past seven or eight years, the average growth rate has been around 10%. From January to September this year, the growth rate was 8.74%, and there was no decline. It is estimated that the annual growth rate of 7.5% can be completed this year.

Fiscal revenue has increased year by year. The province's local fiscal revenue was 1.09 billion yuan in 1983 and 2.498 billion yuan last year. This year, it is expected to reach 2.9 billion yuan, with an average annual net increase of 300 million yuan and a growth rate of over 12%.

Summarizing the experiences of the past few years, Governor Jia Zhijie attributed Gansu's economic development to "four stabilizations."

First, stabilizing agricultural development. The basic approach is that party and government leaders at all levels in the province, prefectures, counties, and townships all prioritize agriculture in economic work. On this issue, there is no separation of party and government. Focusing on improving the basic conditions of agricultural production, the province has been carrying out large-scale agricultural water conservancy construction year after year. Every effort is made to increase agricultural investment and implement large-scale agricultural technology contracts. Last year, the province's local financial investment in agriculture accounted for 19%.

Second, stabilizing the development of basic industries dominated by energy and raw materials. The Jingyuan Thermal Power Plant and the Second Thermal Power Plant in Lanzhou have partially started operation this year. The second phase of Jinchuan, the Changdi lead-zinc mine, the Baiyin aluminum plant, and the Northwest lead-zinc smelting plant, as well as new and renovated projects, are being implemented. After the completion of these projects, Gansu will become the largest non-ferrous metal production base in the country. Large-scale petrochemical enterprises such as Lanrefining and Lanchem have begun to show benefits after technological transformation. The development of these basic industries not only allows Gansu to leverage its advantages in mineral resources, laying the foundation for the continuous development of the province's industry, but also contributes to easing the nationwide supply-demand tension of raw materials.

Third, stabilizing various effective policies and measures. In response to the concerns of cadres and the masses about policy changes, the provincial party committee and government have repeatedly emphasized that all reform measures and policies that have been affirmed by the central government and proven to be feasible through practice should be continued. At the same time, based on the exposed contradictions and problems, they are being supplemented and improved. In rural areas, the main focus is on stabilizing the responsibility system and encouraging farmers to increase their investment in land. For enterprises, the main emphasis is on the stability of various forms of contract systems. Therefore, farmers, workers, and enterprise managers have a more solid foundation, maintaining their enthusiasm for production and operation.

Fourth, stabilizing the grassroots leadership and cadre teams. To address the short-term behavior of some cadres, the provincial party committee and government emphasized during the grassroots leadership change that the main leaders should be stable. At the same time, for enterprises, it is proposed that the contract teams with obvious benefits and correct operational directions should be relatively stable.

    坚持艰苦奋斗　立足稳中求进
    甘肃经济持续平稳发展
    粮食连续7年增产　工业发展速度适中　财政收入逐年上升
    本报兰州11月14日电　记者张述圣报道：党的十一届三中全会前30年经济建设曾几起几落的甘肃省，正确吸取历史经验教训，在发展甘肃经济、改变贫困面貌的过程中，树立长期艰苦创业的思想，既重视困难，又积极进取，稳中求进，促使全省各项建设事业持续平稳发展。
    显示这个重大变化的主要标志是：
    农业生产连续7年增长，平均每年递增5％以上。其中粮食连续7年增产，尤其引人注目。据统计，全省粮食总产从1982年的46.9亿公斤增加到去年的59.3亿公斤。今年再创历史最高水平，总产达62.5亿公斤。
    工业发展速度比较适中。近七八年平均增长幅度为10％左右。今年1至9月，增长幅度为8.74％，没有出现滑坡，预计全年可完成增长7.5％的计划。
    财政收入逐年上升。全省地方财政收入1983年10.9亿元，去年24.98亿元，今年预计可达29亿元，大体年均净增3亿元，增长幅度在12％以上。
    总结过去几年的经验，省长贾志杰把甘肃经济的发展，归结为“四个稳定”。
    一是稳定发展农业。基本作法是，省、地、县、乡各级党政领导，都把农业放在经济工作的首位。在这个问题上，不搞党政分开。以改变农业生产基本条件为重点，连年大搞农田水利基本建设。千方百计增加农业投入，实行大面积农业科技承包。去年，省地方财力向农业的投入占到19％。
    二是稳定发展以能源、原材料为主导的基础工业。靖远火电厂、兰州第二热电厂今年已部分投产。金川二期、厂坝铅锌矿、白银铝厂和西北铅锌冶炼厂等新建和改造项目正加紧实施。这些项目完成后，甘肃将成为全国最大的有色金属生产基地。大型石油化工企业兰炼、兰化技术改造后，开始发挥效益。这些基础工业的发展，不仅使甘肃矿产资源丰富的优势得以发挥，为全省工业持续发展奠定基础，而且为缓解全国原材料供需紧张作出贡献。
    三是稳定各项行之有效的政策措施。针对干部群众怕政策多变的疑虑，省委、省政府反复强调，凡是中央肯定的、经过实践证明切实可行的各项改革措施和政策，都要继续实行。同时，根据暴露出的矛盾和问题，加以充实和完善。在农村，主要是稳定联产承包制，鼓励农民增加对土地的投入。对企业，主要是强调各种形式的承包制稳定不变。因而，农民和职工包括企业经营者心里比较踏实，保持了生产经营的积极性。
    四是稳定基层领导班子和干部队伍。为了解决一些干部的短期行为问题，省委、省政府在基层班子换届中强调，主要领导要稳定。同时对企业也提出，凡是承包效益明显的，经营方向正确的，承包班子要相对稳定。
