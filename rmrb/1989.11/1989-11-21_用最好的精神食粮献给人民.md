Socialist literary and artistic workers should adopt a serious attitude towards literary and artistic creation and the production of spiritual products.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Literary and artistic workers who are responsible to the people must always face the broad masses, strive for excellence in art, avoid shoddy work, and seriously consider the social impact of their works, striving to offer the best spiritual nourishment to the people." (_Deng Xiaoping on Literature and Art_, page 7) This is the requirement that the Party and the people have put forward for literary and artistic workers, and it is also the goal that literary and artistic workers should strive to achieve through their artistic practice.

Socialist literature and art is an important component of socialist spiritual civilization. It plays an irreplaceable and immense role in cultivating new people who have ideals, morality, culture, and discipline, and in raising the ideological, moral, and cultural standards of the entire nation. Good literary and artistic works can enable people to enjoy noble aesthetic pleasure in healthy entertainment, to be influenced and educated by socialist ideology and morality, and thus to inspire the people to strive for progress and to work hard for the great and magnificent cause of socialist modernization. On the other hand, bad literary and artistic works, through their subtle influence, can poison people's souls with the decadent and corrupt ideas of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes, pollute the social atmosphere, shake people's confidence in the cause of socialism and communism, dissipate people's revolutionary spirit, and even lead some weak-willed individuals to fall into decadence or even crime. Therefore, we must clearly advocate and support good literary and artistic works and resolutely oppose and eliminate those spiritual trash. Socialist literary and artistic workers must not shirk their social responsibilities, using spiritual opium to poison the people, but must insist on serving the people and socialism, consciously standing on the side of socialism, starting from the fundamental interests of the Party and the people, and striving to create good literary and artistic works.

Producing the best spiritual nourishment requires both ideological content and artistic standards. An excellent literary and artistic work should not only have a clear ideological orientation but also have high artistic standards, striving to achieve a unity of revolutionary ideological content and perfect artistic form. In the current stage, such works should strive to present the main melody of our times, truly reflecting the struggle and life of the hundreds of millions of people in adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, carrying out reform and opening up, and building socialist modernization, creating vivid and moving artistic images of new socialist people, showing their new faces with revolutionary ideals and scientific attitudes, noble sentiments and creative abilities, broad vision and practical spirit. Through these new people's images, embody the requirements of the times and the trend of historical development, and strike the strongest chord of the times. This requires literary and artistic workers to continuously improve their ideological and artistic levels to meet this creative requirement. For this reason, Comrade Deng Xiaoping proposed that literary and artistic workers should strive to train themselves to become engineers of the human soul, and according to the laws of literary and artistic creation, pointed out the direction for literary and artistic workers to advance, which is: to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought diligently, to improve one's ability to understand, analyze, and grasp the essence of life through phenomena; to criticize and oppose the tendency to worship capitalism and advocate bourgeois liberalization, to criticize and oppose the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie such as harming others for personal gain, seeking profit at all costs, and "everything for money," to criticize and oppose anarchism and extreme individualism, and to improve one's spiritual world; to consciously accept the education of the masses, to go among the people to draw materials, themes, plots, language, poetry, and imagery, and to nourish oneself with the spirit of the people creating history; to study, absorb, integrate, and develop all the good things in the art techniques of ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, to constantly enrich and improve one's artistic expression ability, to be undaunted by difficulties, to study hard, to be bold in exploration, and to climb the artistic peak.

In the ten years since China implemented the reform and opening up, the vast number of literary and artistic workers have followed the direction pointed out by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, actively participated in the great practice of reform and opening up and the Four Modernizations, and created excellent works that present "new people and a new world." Literature and art of various genres have produced a large number of spiritual nourishment that can inspire the people's spirit and push them to bravely devote themselves to the reform and construction of various fields of the motherland, with a strong sense of the times. However, due to the rampant bourgeois liberalization in recent years and the corruption of the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes, some literary and artistic workers and editors of literary and artistic publications and books have published works with low taste and unhealthy content, which are at odds with the fundamental direction of socialist literature and art. Literary and artistic workers should learn from the lessons, seriously summarize the historical experience and lessons, actively participate in the struggle against bourgeois liberalization, and with great enthusiasm, reflect and present the fiery reality of struggle and life, create more and better literary and artistic works that embody a strong spirit of the times, and meet the growing cultural needs of the people.

　　用最好的精神食粮献给人民
　　陈运祐
    社会主义的文艺工作者，应该以严肃的态度对待文艺创作和精神产品生产的问题。
    邓小平同志指出：“对人民负责的文艺工作者，要始终不渝地面向广大群众，在艺术上精益求精，力戒粗制滥造，认真严肃地考虑自己作品的社会效果，力求把最好的精神食粮贡献给人民。”（《邓小平论文艺》第7页）这是党和人民对文艺工作者提出的要求，也是文艺工作者通过自己的艺术实践要努力达到的奋斗目标。
    社会主义文艺是社会主义精神文明的一个重要组成部分，它在培养有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的新人、提高全民族的思想道德和文化素质方面，有着不可替代的巨大的作用。好的文艺作品，能够使人们在健康的娱乐之中得到高尚的审美享受，受到社会主义思想道德情操的熏陶和教育，从而鼓舞人民奋发图强，积极向上，为伟大壮丽的社会主义现代化建设事业而英勇奋斗。而坏的文艺作品，则通过潜移默化的作用，让形形色色的资产阶级和其它剥削阶级腐朽没落的思想毒害人们的灵魂，污染社会空气，动摇人们对社会主义、共产主义事业的信心，涣散人们的革命斗志，甚至把一些意志薄弱者引向堕落乃至犯罪的道路。因此，我们旗帜鲜明地提倡和扶植好的文艺作品，坚决反对和清除那些黄色的精神垃圾。社会主义的文艺工作者绝不能放弃自己的社会责任，用精神鸦片去毒害人民，而必须坚持为人民服务、为社会主义服务的方向，自觉地站在社会主义的立场上，从党和人民的根本利益出发，努力创作出好的文艺作品。
    生产最好的精神食粮，既有思想内容方面的要求，又有艺术方面的要求。一部优秀的文艺作品，不仅应该具有鲜明的思想倾向性，而且要具有很高的艺术性，力求达到革命的思想内容和完美的艺术形式的统一。在现阶段，这样的作品就要努力表现我们时代的主旋律，真实地反映亿万人民群众坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放、进行社会主义现代化建设的斗争生活，塑造有血有肉、生动感人的社会主义新人的艺术形象，表现他们那种有革命理想和科学态度、有高尚情操和创造能力、有宽阔眼界和求实精神的崭新面貌，通过这些新人的形象，体现时代前进的要求和历史发展趋势，奏出时代的最强音。这就需要文艺工作者不断提高自己的思想水平和艺术修养，以适应这个创作要求。为此，邓小平同志提出文艺工作者要努力把自己锻炼成为人类灵魂的工程师，并根据文艺创作的规律给文艺工作者指出前进的方向，这就是：要努力学习马列主义、毛泽东思想，提高自己认识生活、分析生活、透过现象抓住事物本质的能力；要批判和反对崇拜资本主义、主张资产阶级自由化的倾向，批判和反对资产阶级损人利已、唯利是图、“一切向钱看”的腐朽思想，批判和反对无政府主义、极端个人主义，提高自己的精神世界；要自觉地接受人民群众的教育，到人民群众中去汲取题材、主题、情节、语言、诗情和画意，用人民创造历史的奋发精神来哺育自己；要认真钻研、吸收、融化和发展古今中外艺术技巧中一切好的东西，不断丰富和提高自己的艺术表现能力，不畏艰难，勤学苦练，勇于探索，攀登艺术高峰。
    我国实行改革开放十年来，广大文艺工作者遵循邓小平同志指出的文艺方向，积极参加改革开放和四化建设的伟大实践，创作出表现“新的人物，新的世界”的优秀作品，文学和艺术的各个门类都生产出大批能够振奋人民精神，推动他们勇敢献身于祖国各个领域的改革和建设、具有强烈时代感的精神食粮。但是，由于这几年资产阶级自由化的泛滥，由于资产阶级和其它剥削阶级腐朽思想的腐蚀，一些文艺工作者和文艺报刊书籍的编辑出版部门，出版了格调不高，内容不健康的作品，与社会主义文艺的根本方向相背离。文艺工作者要吸取教训，认真总结历史的经验教训，积极投入反对资产阶级自由化的斗争，以极大的热情去反映和表现火热的现实斗争生活，创作出更多更好的、体现强烈时代精神的文艺作品。满足人民群众日益增长的文化生活的需要。
