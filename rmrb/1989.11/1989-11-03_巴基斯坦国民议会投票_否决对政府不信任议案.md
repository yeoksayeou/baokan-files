The Pakistani National Assembly voted today to reject a no-confidence motion against the government of Benazir Bhutto, thus ending a week-long political crisis in the country.

The debate began at 10 a.m. local time, with four representatives from the opposition and one from the government presenting their arguments on the no-confidence motion.

The opposition criticized the government for corruption and inefficiency, holding it responsible for the deteriorating rule of law in the country. They argued that the government had made mistakes in handling economic issues, relations between the central and provincial governments, and the promotion of democracy.

Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto defended her government, stating that it aimed to implement a strong and democratic federal policy. She believed that the no-confidence motion would only slow down the democratic process.

Bhutto expressed her willingness to engage in dialogue with patriotic individuals within the country who advocate for stronger democracy.

Following the debate, the National Assembly members voted on the no-confidence motion. With 107 votes in favor and 119 against, the motion was defeated by a margin of 12 votes. According to the Pakistani Constitution, at least 119 votes are required in the 237-member National Assembly to remove the prime minister from office.

    巴基斯坦国民议会投票
    否决对政府不信任议案
    新华社伊斯兰堡11月1日电　由巴基斯坦反对党联合发起的旨在反对贝·布托政府的不信任投票今天在国民议会上遭到否决，从而结束了长达一周的巴基斯坦政府危机。
    从当地时间上午10时开始，4名反对党代表和一名政府代表在国民议会上就不信任投票议案展开辩论。
    反对派批评政府内部的腐败和低效现象，认为政府应对国内每况愈下的法治状况负责。
    他们认为，政府在处理经济、中央与省级政府的关系、推进民主等问题上存在失误。
    贝·布托总理说，她领导的政府就是要在国内实行一种强有力的、民主的联邦政策。她认为不信任投票只能减缓民主进程。
    贝·布托表示，政府已准备与国内要求加强民主的爱国人士进行对话。
    在辩论后的国民议会成员投票表决中，有107票赞成不信任投票议案，以12票之差被政府方面击败。据巴基斯坦宪法规定，在国民议会的237人中，至少要有119票支持才能让总理下台。
