China's research on the prevention and treatment of viral hepatitis has made significant progress. Recently, at the International Symposium on Viral Hepatitis held in Shanghai, Chinese medical experts presented their research findings, which were highly praised by experts from various countries.

In recent years, China has conducted comprehensive research on viral hepatitis, achieving rapid progress. The non-A, non-B hepatitis prevalent in Xinjiang has now been identified with its pattern of occurrence and virus, and a successful vaccination has been developed. Previously considered rare in China, hepatitis D was found in 5.3% to 19.7% of liver biopsy samples from a study of 2,000 samples nationwide by experts in Wuhan. In basic theoretical research, China's molecular hybridization technology for hepatitis A and B viruses has reached international standards. China has also successfully established a duck hepatitis model, which has played a significant role in studying the pathogenesis and screening drugs. In terms of prevention and treatment research, the hepatitis A vaccine developed by Zhejiang and Shanghai has been successfully tested on over 100 people, all of whom produced antibodies with good results. The hepatitis B vaccine is now in large-scale production and is gradually being promoted for planned immunization.

(Reporter: Jiang Wei) The Vascular Surgery Department of the Ninth People's Hospital affiliated with the Second Military Medical University in Shanghai has used staged arteriovenous shunt surgery to treat extensive occlusions of the main arteries in the lower limbs. Experimental and clinical research has shown that this surgical method has satisfactory long-term efficacy.

Under the leadership of Professors Sun Jianmin and Zhang Peihua, the medical staff of the Vascular Surgery Department at the Ninth People's Hospital have performed this surgery on 146 affected limbs since 1984, saving 107 limbs that would otherwise have been amputated. The other affected limbs have also shown varying degrees of recovery.

Recently, experts have evaluated this achievement and deemed it to have reached an internationally advanced level. This achievement has been promoted in more than ten provinces and cities in China, including Shanxi, with good therapeutic effects.

　　我国病毒性肝炎防治工作进展迅速
　　分期动静脉转流术达国际先进水平
    新华社上海11月18日电　我国防治病毒性肝炎的研究取得可喜进展。近日在上海举行的国际病毒性肝炎研讨会上，我国各地医学专家介绍的研究成果受到各国专家的好评。
    近年来，我国全方位开展病毒性肝炎的研究，进展迅速。新疆流行的非甲非乙型肝炎，目前已找到发病规律及病毒，并接种成功。过去认为在我国少见的丁型肝炎，经武汉专家对全国2000个肝穿刺标本的研究，发现有5.3％至19.7％的标本有丁型肝炎病毒。在基础理论的研究上，我国的甲、乙型肝炎病毒分子杂交技术已达到国际水平。我国还成功地建立了鸭肝炎模型，在研究发病机理、筛选药物方面起了很大作用。在防治研究方面，浙江与上海研制成功的甲肝疫苗，经100多人试用，均产生抗体，效果良好。乙型肝炎疫苗目前已大规模生产，正逐步推广计划免疫。
    据新华社上海11月18日电　（记者姜微）上海第二医科大学附属第九人民医院血管外科利用分期动静脉转流术，治疗下肢广泛性动脉主干闭塞症。实验和临床研究证实：这种手术方法具有满意的远期疗效。
    第九人民医院血管外科的医务人员在孙建民、张培华教授的带领下，自1984年起先后为146条患肢施行了这种手术，挽救了107条原来需要截掉的肢体，其它患肢也有不同程度的恢复。
    最近，有关专家对这项成果作了鉴定，认为已达到国际先进水平。这一成果目前已在我国山西等十余个省市推广，均收到了较好疗效。
