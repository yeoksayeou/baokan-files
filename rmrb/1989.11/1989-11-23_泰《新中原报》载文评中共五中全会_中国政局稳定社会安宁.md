The Thai newspaper "New Zhongyuan" recently published an article pointing out that the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee reflects China's confidence in the development of the situation, indicating the stability of China's political situation.

The article states that the restructuring of the top leadership of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China is a decision made after careful consideration by the highest leadership of the Communist Party of China. This shows that, in order to adapt to the situation of the party and government, the old generation of leaders headed by Deng Xiaoping has formally handed over the leadership of the military to the third generation of leaders. Making this decision to change the leadership of the Military Commission at this time indicates that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has great confidence in the current domestic situation of China. That is to say, the aftershocks of the "June 4th" incident have subsided, the political situation is stable, society is peaceful, and the highest leadership of the military can be reorganized smoothly without causing any unrest.

The article points out that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposes to rectify and deepen reforms to achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy. This can be said to be a summary of the serious mistakes made in the previous stage of economic development. To achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated development, it is necessary to have an in-depth understanding of the relationships between various sectors of the national economy and to exercise macro-control over economic development, preventing subjectivity, one-sidedness, blindness, decentralization, and anarchism. To propose that the development of the economy should be sustained, stable, and coordinated from the painful lessons of the past is to say, "repairing the fence after the sheep have been stolen is not too late."

The article concludes that, in general, this Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee is a meeting to summarize experiences and open up new initiatives. Looking at China's past situation, it is often the case that "once you grasp it, it dies; once you let go, it becomes chaotic." The key is to seriously implement the decisions and truly achieve "grasping without killing, and letting go without chaos."

### 泰《新中原报》载文评中共五中全会　中国政局稳定社会安宁

    泰《新中原报》载文评中共五中全会
　　中国政局稳定社会安宁
    本报讯　泰国《新中原报》最近发表文章，指出中共十三届五中全会反映了中国对形势发展深具信心，表明中国政局的稳定。
    文章说，这次中共中央军委最高领导层的改组，是中共最高领导层经过深思熟虑之后做出的决策，说明为了与党政的情况相适应，以邓小平为首的中国老一代领导人，已把军队的领导权正式转给了第三代领导人。这个时候作出改变军委领导班子的决策，说明中共中央对当前的中国国内形势深具信心。那就是说，“六·四”事件的荡漾余波已告平息，政局稳定，社会安宁，军队最高领导班子能够进行顺利改组而不会引发任何动荡不安。
    文章指出，中共中央提出治理整顿和深化改革的目的在于实现国民经济持续、稳定、协调发展，可以说是从前一段发展经济的严重失误的教训中总结出来的。要持续、稳定、协调，就必须对国民经济各个部门之间的关系有深入的了解，在经济发展上加以宏观控制，防止主观随意性、片面性、盲目性、分散主义和无政府主义。从过去的惨痛教训中提出使经济的发展达到持续、稳定、协调，应当说是“亡羊补牢，犹未为晚”。
    文章最后认为，总的说，这次中共十三届五中全会是一次总结经验、开展新猷的会议，按照中国过去的情况看，往往是“一抓就死，一放就乱”。决定做出来了，关键问题是认真贯彻，真正做到“抓而不死，放而不乱”。
