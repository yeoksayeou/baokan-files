    China's gold production has been steadily increasing. From January to October, the national gold output has completed 79.6% of the annual plan, marking a 13.7% increase compared to the same period last year. Among these, the gold enterprises' self-produced finished gold has completed 88.1% of the plan, a 24.4% increase compared to the same period last year.

    This year has been particularly challenging for gold production enterprises due to shortages in funds, electricity, and raw materials. Despite these difficulties, the State Gold Administration, in collaboration with relevant departments and local governments at various levels, has implemented a series of effective measures. They have strengthened the leadership of key gold-producing provinces and allocated a significant amount of retained foreign exchange funds to import or exchange necessary materials such as cyanide, steel, timber, and diesel for gold production. Some key enterprises have even reduced retained profits and negotiated electricity prices to ensure the smooth operation of production. For instance, the Wulong Gold Mine in Liaoning Province, despite experiencing over 50 days of power outages in 10 months, still managed to complete the national plan on time.

    By the end of October, nine provinces and municipalities, including Shandong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Anhui, Gansu, Beijing, Guangdong, Guizhou, and Jiangsu, had completed over 90% of their annual plans. Counties such as Lingbao in Henan and Muping in Shandong, as well as mines like Xincheng in Shandong, Heihe in Heilongjiang, and others, have all completed their annual plans. Notably, the Wulaga Gold Mine Bureau in Heilongjiang completed its annual plan 120 days ahead of schedule.

　　我国黄金生产稳步上升
　　前10月产量已完成年计划79.6％
    本报北京11月24日讯　记者杨涌报道：在国务院有关部门和产金省、市、县各级政府的支持下，我国黄金生产形势喜人。1至10月份，全国黄金产量已完成年计划的79.6％，比去年同期增长13.7％。其中，黄金企业自产成品金完成计划的88.1％，比去年同期增长24.4％。
    今年是黄金生产企业资金、电力、原材料十分困难的一年。面对不利因素，国家黄金管理局会同各部门，各省、区、市、县有关领导，采取一系列切实可行的措施，充实加强了重点产金省黄金部门的领导，并拿出大量留成外汇资金，进口、串换产金所必需的氰化钠、钢材、木材、柴油等物资。一些重点企业甚至不惜减少利润留成，议价用电，保证生产的正常进行。辽宁五龙金矿10个月累计停电50多天，仍按期完成了国家计划。
    到10月底，全国已有山东、黑龙江、吉林、安徽、甘肃、北京、广东、贵州、江苏9省、市完成年计划超过90％；河南灵宝、山东牟平两县，山东新城、黑龙江黑河等八矿已完成全年计划。其中，黑龙江乌拉嘎金矿局提前120天完成了全年计划。
