The Navy has been running theoretical study classes for nine consecutive years, training over 1,200 mid-level and senior cadres.

To strengthen the theoretical construction of Marxism-Leninism among mid-level and senior cadres, the Navy started in 1981 to use the Central Party School as a base, organizing half-year theoretical study classes to continuously train corps and division-level cadres and theoretical cadres from the troops. At the same time, a system for leading cadres to study Marxism-Leninism theory was established, stipulating that corps-level cadres must attend a theoretical study class during their term of office; cadres preparing to enter the corps and division-level leadership teams must also first attend a theoretical study class for theoretical training, providing them with opportunities for theoretical study. After the troops were streamlined and reorganized, various tasks became more demanding, and the contradictions between cadre work and study became more pronounced. In response, the Navy Party Committee made plans, coordinated arrangements, and ensured that while cadres were in position to manage the troops, they could still be selected to attend theoretical study classes as much as possible.

The study classes organized cadres to seriously study the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism, focusing on the study of Marxism-Leninism philosophical works, and striving to explore the theoretical and practical issues of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Mid-level and senior cadres participating in the study also conducted research around the theoretical issues raised by the troops, and then brought the results back to the troops to guide and promote the theoretical study of cadres at all levels. After the rotation of mid-level and senior cadres, over 1,000 study papers were written. They said that participating in a study class would improve their Marxism-Leninism theoretical level by one step, and add one more aspect to their ability to manage the troops.

Vice Procurator-General Wang Xiaoguang today spoke at the national procurator-general work conference, urging procuratorial organs at all levels to organize all cadres to seriously study the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and to establish and improve the study system.

Wang Xiaoguang said that the current focus of studying Marxist basic theories is to study Marxist philosophy well. According to the requirements of procuratorial work, first focus on selecting and reading Marx, Engels, and Lenin's "The Communist Manifesto," "Critique of the Gotha Program," "On Dialectics," as well as Mao Zedong's "On Protracted War," "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and other 10 classic works. Through study, gradually master the basic views and methods of Marxist dialectical materialism and historical materialism, as well as Marxist state theory, democracy, and dictatorship theory.

Wang Xiaoguang also urged all procuratorial cadres to seriously study the important works of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, to understand and grasp the series of views and theories proposed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping based on the principle of combining Marxism-Leninism with Chinese revolutionary practice, especially the basic theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

Wang Xiaoguang required procuratorial organs at all levels to continue to deeply carry out education on the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization, further strengthen the construction of procuratorial integrity, and focus on improving the ability of leading cadres and procuratorial personnel at all levels to resist corruption.

　　海军着力培训中高级干部
　　高检要求干警认真学马列
    新华社北京11月25日电　（记者黄彩虹）海军坚持9年办理论读书班，培训中高级干部1200多名。
    海军为加强中高级干部的马列主义理论建设，从1981年开始以中央党校为依托，以半年制理论读书班的形式，不间断地培训军师职干部和部队理论骨干。同时，还建立了领导干部学习马列主义理论的制度，规定军职干部在任职内必须到理论读书班学习一次；准备进军师级领导班子的干部也要先到理论读书班培训，为他们提供理论进修的机会。部队精简整编后，各项任务繁重，干部工作和学习矛盾日益突出。对此，海军党委作出规划，统筹安排，保证干部在位抓部队工作的前提下，尽可能抽调一些现职主要领导参加理论读书班学习。
    读书班组织干部认真学习马列主义基本理论，着重学习马列主义哲学著作，努力探讨建设有中国特色的社会主义的理论与实践问题。参加学习的中高级干部还围绕部队在理论学习中提出的问题开展研究，而后将成果带回部队，指导和带动各级干部的理论学习。经过轮训的中高级干部先后写出了1000多篇学习论文。他们说，参加一次读书班，马列理论水平就提高一步，做好部队工作的“本钱”就增添一分。
    新华社北京11月25日电　最高人民检察院副检察长王晓光今天在全国检察长工作会议上讲话，要求各级检察机关组织全体干警认真学习马列主义、毛泽东思想基本理论，并要建立健全学习制度。
    王晓光说，当前，学习马克思主义基本理论的重点是学好马克思主义哲学。根据检察工作要求，先重点选读马、恩、列的《共产党宣言》、《哥达纲领批判》、《谈谈辩证法》，以及毛泽东的《论持久战》、《矛盾论》、《实践论》等10部经典著作。通过学习，逐步掌握马克思主义的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义基本观点和方法以及马克思主义国家学说、民主与专政学说等。
    王晓光还要求全体检察机关干警要认真学好邓小平同志的重要著作，了解掌握邓小平同志根据马克思列宁主义同中国革命实际相结合的原则提出的一系列观点和理论，特别是建设具有中国特色的社会主义的基本理论。
    王晓光要求各级检察院继续深入进行四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育，进一步加强检察机关的廉政建设，着重提高各级领导干部和广大检察人员的抗腐蚀能力。
