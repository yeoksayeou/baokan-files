	British museum staff have recently racked their brains and gone to great lengths, but still failed to raise 400,000 pounds within a six-month deadline. They could only watch helplessly as a precious collection of 19th-century artist William Blake's sketches fell into the hands of Uncle Sam.

	In recent years, the global market for famous paintings and artifacts has been exceptionally active. Wealthy individuals have been vying to purchase world-renowned artworks to flaunt their riches, causing the prices of famous paintings to skyrocket.

	Just last year, Britain alone saw 1 billion pounds worth of famous paintings and ancient artifacts auctioned off, with most of the works ending up in the hands of Americans and Japanese. This year, a large number of precious artworks have similarly ended up abroad. The most notable case is that of the famous painting "Seascape" by Scottish National Gallery's renowned artist Turner, which was "plundered" for 20 million pounds. Currently, several other art treasures face the same fate. For instance, the Getty Museum in California is seeking to acquire the works of the Italian neoclassical sculptor Canova, "The Three Graces" (valued at 7.6 million pounds, currently housed in the Worcester Cathedral in Britain). Next month, the work "The Family" by the 18th-century master Zoffany will be auctioned off for 2 million pounds.

	The British cultural heritage protection department has expressed strong dissatisfaction with the government's approach, which they liken to that of a "spendthrift." They have called on the government to provide funding to ensure that national treasures do not leave the country. However, facing the soaring prices of artworks, the chairman of the British National Heritage Memorial Fund, Sir Chatteris, helplessly stated that the fund lacks resources and is unable to save every artifact. Even if the 19 art galleries and museums in Britain were to join forces, they could only raise 13 million pounds, which is a drop in the bucket and ineffective.

	Recently, the British Heritage Memorial Fund and the Cultural Relics Export Management Committee, in their annual report to the government, criticized the government for blaming the loss of cultural relics on financial constraints without addressing the root of the problem. They urged the government to provide sufficient funds to ensure that cultural relics do not continue to flow out of the country and to formulate strict cultural relics export management regulations to effectively prevent and restrict the export of cultural relics.

### 英国名画“流落他乡”

    英国名画“流落他乡”
    最近，英国博物馆的工作人员绞尽脑汁，费了千辛万苦，还是未能在六个月期限内筹集到40万英镑，只好眼睁睁地看着一套珍贵的19世纪画家威廉·布莱克的速写集落入山姆大叔之手。
    近年来，世界名画及文物拍卖市场异常活跃，腰缠万贯的豪富纷纷竞相争购世界名画以示其富。名画价格一时骤然上涨。
    仅去年一年内，英国就有价值10亿英镑的名画和古代文物被拍卖，大部分作品是被美国人和日本人买走。今年，又有大量珍贵艺术品流落他乡，其中最为突出的是，苏格兰国家美术馆收藏的著名画家特纳的佳作《海景》被人以2000万英镑的高价“掠夺”走。眼下，还有一些艺术珍品也面临同样的命运。如美国加利福尼亚州哥狄博物馆欲将意大利杰出的新古典主义雕塑家卡纳瓦的作品《三女神》（价值760万英镑，现存英国沃本大教堂）据为己有；18世纪大画家佐芬尼的作品《家庭》下月将以200万英镑的价格拍卖。
    英国文物保护部门对政府这种近似“败家子”的做法极为不满，曾呼吁政府提供资金以保证本国文物不至流失国外。但是，面对艺术品价格暴涨，英国国家文物保护基金会主席查特斯爵士无可奈何地表示，基金会缺少资金，无力挽救每一件文物。即使英国19家美术馆和博物馆联合起来，也只能筹集到1300万英镑，杯水车薪，无济于事。
    最近，英国文物保护基金会和文物出口管理委员会在一份给政府的年度报告中，指责政府把文物流失归咎于财力不足，而不从根本上解决这个问题。他们呼吁政府提供足够的资金以确保文物不再继续流往他国，同时制定严格的文物出口管理法规，有效地阻止和限制文物的出口。（贾光伟　编译）
