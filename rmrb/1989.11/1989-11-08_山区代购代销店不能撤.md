Rural purchase and sales agencies in mountainous areas should not be closed

The rural purchase and sales agencies (hereafter referred to as "double agencies") in some counties of our province have been closed one after another, causing great inconvenience to the lives of mountain villagers.

The rural double agencies were established by the supply and marketing cooperatives in 1961 to facilitate the production and living needs of mountain villagers. Over the past 28 years, these agencies have made significant contributions in supplying daily necessities such as cigarettes, alcohol, tea, sugar, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and small commodities to rural areas. They also purchase small local products, traditional Chinese medicines, and waste materials from farmers. These agencies have played a crucial role in "serving one person to benefit an entire village." This is especially true for the farmers living in the rugged terrain of Xianxi County. Xianxi County has developed 114 double agencies out of its 400 natural villages.

Recently, due to the high fees charged by the industrial and commercial departments for changing licenses and the increased taxes imposed by the tax authorities, many grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives find it difficult to bear the financial burden. The cooperatives no longer make profits from these double agencies and are unwilling or unable to spend a large sum of money to change the licenses for these agencies. Additionally, with the increase in taxes, the annual remuneration of the sales agents has further decreased, making it almost unprofitable. As a result, many agents have requested to close their agencies.

Currently, the number of double agencies in our county has decreased from 114 to 91. Villagers living in the rugged mountainous areas now have to worry about traveling tens of miles to buy vinegar and salt. They eagerly hope that the relevant departments will consider their needs when making decisions. They look forward to the early restoration of the double agencies that serve the people.

### 山区代购代销店不能撤

    山区代购代销店不能撤
    我县一些农村双代店（代购、代销）纷纷撤销，给山区农民的生活带来了极大不便。
    农村双代店是1961年供销社为方便山区群众生产生活而建立的。28年来，双代店在供应农村日用生活必需品，如烟、酒、茶、糖、油、盐、酱、醋及小百货，代购农民手中的小土产、中药材、废旧物资等做出了很大贡献，起到了“拿出一个人，方便一个村”的作用。特别是对于居住在七沟八梁一面坡的迁西县山区农民更是不可缺少。迁西县400个自然村已发展有114个双代店。
    最近，由于工商部门对双代店换照收费较高，税务部门也提高了对双代店的收费，使一些基层供销社感到难以负担。供销社在双代店上已不赚钱，故不愿也难以再花一大笔钱为双代店换照。此外，由于征税提高，代销员年度的报酬进一步减少，几乎无利可图，于是纷纷要求撤店。
    目前，我县双代店已由114个减少到91个。一些住在七沟八梁一面坡的山区百姓，又要为跑十几里的山路打醋买盐而犯愁了。他们热切希望有关部门在考虑问题时，多为山里人想想，他们盼望早日恢复方便群众的双代店。河北迁西县供销社
