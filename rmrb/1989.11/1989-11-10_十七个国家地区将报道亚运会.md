    17 countries and regions will send 18 news organizations to Beijing to cover the 11th Asian Games next September.

    This was revealed by Mrs. Pavoli Walkem, Chairman of the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU), at a press conference held this afternoon.

    She said that ABU will organize a special team to produce a one-hour highlights program each day, mainly for ABU member countries that will not be sending reporters to Beijing.

    Countries and regions such as Japan, North Korea, and Hong Kong will provide extensive and detailed coverage of the Asian Games; countries like India and Pakistan will focus on sports they are interested in, such as field hockey.

    She said that these reports will add up to several hours each day.

    The press conference was held for the closing of the 26th ABU General Assembly, which lasted 13 days. More than 230 representatives from 31 countries and regions and 12 international organizations attended the assembly.

    During the assembly, eight professional meetings were held to discuss issues such as news exchange, joint production of television programs, and technical exchanges.

    十七个国家地区将报道亚运会
    新华社北京11月9日电  （记者沈智勇）明年9月，将有17个国家和地区的18个新闻机构来京报道第11届亚运会。
    这是亚洲—太平洋广播联盟（亚广联）主席帕沃莉·沃克姆女士在今天下午举行的记者招待会上透露的。
    她说，亚广联将组织一个专门小组把每天的精彩节目作一个小时的报道，主要提供给那些不来北京进行报道的亚广联成员国。
    日本、朝鲜、香港等国家和地区将对亚运会作广泛、详细的报道；印度、巴基斯坦等国家则侧重报道它们感兴趣的曲棍球等项目。
    她说，这些报道加起来，每天将有好几个小时。
    这次记者招待会是为今天闭幕的亚广联第26届大会而举行的。这次大会历时13天，来自31个国家和地区及12个国际组织的230多名代表参加了大会。
    大会期间，召开的8个专业会议，讨论了关于新闻交换、共同制作电视节目、技术交流等问题。
