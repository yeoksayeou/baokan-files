A four-level highway utilizing a loan from the World Bank has recently been completed and opened to traffic in the treacherous valley of Qixi Ling in Jinggangshan.

This 16.1-kilometer-long highway is a project decided by the Party and the state to improve the transportation conditions in the old revolutionary base area. It is located in the middle section of the Luoxiao Mountains, passing through famous historical sites from the Jinggangshan revolutionary period, such as the victory at Longyuankou, the battle of Qixi Ling, and the victory at Xincheng. The route is filled with steep cliffs and treacherous terrain. Construction began at the end of 1985, with a total of 82 culverts and 10 bridges built along the way.

    井冈山天险通公路
    新华社南昌11月13日电  （通讯员龙志忠）在井冈山天险峡谷的七溪岭，一条利用世界银行贷款修建的四级公路最近建成通车。
    这条全长16.1公里的公路，是党和国家为改善老区交通状况而决定修建的。它位于罗霄山脉中段，途经井冈山斗争时期著名的龙源口大捷、七溪岭战斗、新城大捷等旧址，所经之处多为悬崖峭壁，地势险要。工程于1985年底开工，先后修建涵洞82个，架设桥梁10座。
