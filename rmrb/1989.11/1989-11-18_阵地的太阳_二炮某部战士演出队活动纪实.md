The dense forest and deep mountains, shrouded in thunder and lightning, conceal the missile launch sites. The performance troupe of a certain unit of the Second Artillery Corps has traversed this lonely land. With their songs and dances, they weave through the shafts and towers, playing a moving melody of the rocket forces.

One day, the troupe's vehicle broke down in a remote mountain area. The members huddled together and spent 8 hours in the mountain wind without sleep. At 4 a.m., a rescue vehicle from the unit finally took them to the performance site. The troupe leader gave the order: "Set up the stage!" The members carried soil, carried sand, laid out car tarps as carpets, and stacked stones as stage fronts. After half a day of intense labor, they finally set up a makeshift stage in front of the launch site.

As the last rays of sunset faded, the soldiers and local residents rushed to the stage at the foot of the mountain like they were going to a temple fair. The curtain slowly opened, and dancer Li Jun performed a beautiful forward flip. "Oh no!" Li Jun stumbled, falling heavily to the ground, his knee bleeding a cut over an inch long. Li Jun gritted his teeth and stood up, meticulously performing each movement. Blood from the wound splattered across the stage as he spun rapidly.

Applause, cheers, and tears of excitement.

As soon as Li Jun came off stage, the unit's political commissar said with concern, "Didn't I tell you the stage was uneven, and to simplify the movements?" Li Jun smiled, "Our comrades in the mountains rarely get to see a performance. How could I fake it?"

In this way, over the past two years, they have traveled long distances four times, bringing songs and dances to the units, performing over 280 times for both military and civilian audiences, creating more than 70 programs reflecting military life, and attracting over 300,000 spectators. Along the rugged mountain roads they have traveled over 40,000 kilometers, leaving behind countless drops of sweat.

However, it is in the laughter and joy exchanged through their sweat that these young performers have become the "big stars" in the hearts of the rocket forces. "Campus comedian" Liu Xiaochun performs crosstalk, rapid storytelling, and quick rhymes, improvising and performing on the spot. He is also the leader of the band, playing a set of beautiful drums. Liu often leads the "Mountain Red" small troupe of seven to perform in remote and dispersed units, in hospital beds, on mountain tops, in clubs, in temporary sheds, and even on trucks covered with tarps—all are their stages.

They also bring the soldiers who silently dedicate themselves in the deep mountains onto the stage and into the art halls of the capital. Look:

At the China Theater, they choreographed a dance titled "Wedding in the Mountains" based on the story of a launch company commander who postponed his wedding three times. The dance vividly depicts the spiritual realm of young officers who love the Second Artillery Corps, the launch sites, and the mountains.

In August 1987, in the solemn Great Hall of the People, they sang songs they composed, expressing the sentiments of the rocket forces, and performed dances they choreographed, showcasing the spirit of the Second Artillery Corps.

During this year's August 1st Military Day, five singers from the performance troupe sang their self-composed songs "The Lad and the Missile" and "Rocket Forces' Waltz" on the stage of the first national soldiers' singing competition, with two of them winning third prizes.

The performance troupe not only brings songs and dances to the grassroots but is also a comprehensive cultural service team. Whenever they arrive at a unit, the dancers teach the soldiers collective dances, the singers guide the singing core members, the band cultivates musicians, and the stage crew beautifies and decorates the clubs.

The officers and soldiers enthusiastically call them the "Horse Head Fiddles of the Missile Launch Site." Recently, the General Political Department's Cultural Department presented the performance troupe with a banner embroidered with "Guard the Motherland with Divine Swords, Singing Loudly to Boost Military Prestige."

    “阵地的太阳”
    ——二炮某部战士演出队活动纪实
    张玉华
    绿树掩荫的密林深山，藏雷裹电的导弹阵地。二炮某部战士演出队的足迹踏遍了这块寂寞的土地。他们用歌声、舞姿交织着竖井、塔架，奏出了一支火箭兵的动人乐曲。
    一天，演出队的汽车在一个山旮旯里
  “抛了锚”，队员们背靠背地在山风中度过了8个小时的不眠之夜，凌晨4点钟部队救援的车才把他们接到演出点。队长一声令下：
  “装台！”队员们抬土的抬土，背沙的背沙，铺上汽车篷布作地毯，垒起石块当台口，经过半天的紧张劳动，终于在阵地前的一块空地上搭起了简易舞台。
    当晚霞刚刚收回最后一缕余辉，战士们和驻地附近的群众像赶庙会一样，向山脚下的舞台涌来。帷幕徐徐拉开，舞蹈队员李军一个漂亮的前空翻出场，“不好！”小李双腿一歪，重重地摔倒了，膝盖划破了一寸多长的口子。只见小李一咬牙站了起来，一丝不苟地做着每个动作，伤口的鲜血随着他飞快地旋转抛洒在舞台上。
    掌声、欢呼声，还有激动的泪花。
    小李一下场，部队的政委心疼地说：
  “不是告诉你舞台不平，要简化动作难度吗！”小李咧嘴一笑：“战友们在山沟里很难看到演出，我哪能掺假呢！”
    就这样，两年多来他们四次长途跋涉，送歌送舞到连队，共为军内外演出280余场，创作了70多个反映部队生活的节目，观众逾30万。在他们走过的四万多公里的崎岖山路上不知撒下了多少艰辛的汗水。
    然而，正是在汗水换来的欢声笑语中，这些小演员成了火箭兵心目中的“大明星”。“兵营笑星”刘孝春演相声、说快书、数快板，张口就来，现编现演，他还是乐队队长，打一手漂亮的架子鼓。小刘多次带领七人“山里红”小分队深入边远分散连队演出，病房床头，山顶哨所，俱乐部里，临时搭起的工棚里，甚至搭着篷布的卡车，都是他们的舞台。
    他们还把那些在深山里默默奉献的士兵搬上了舞台，走进了首都的艺术殿堂。你看：
    在中国剧院，他们以一位发射连长三推婚期的素材编排的舞蹈《深山的婚礼》，鲜活地勾勒出青年军官爱二炮、爱阵地、爱山沟的精神境界。
    1987年8月，庄严的人民大会堂里，他们用自己谱写的歌曲尽情地抒发着火箭兵的情怀，用自己编排的舞蹈展现出二炮部队指战员的神韵。
    今年“八一”建军节期间，演出队的5名歌手唱着自己创作的《小伙与导弹》、《火箭兵圆舞曲》等歌曲，走上了首届全军战士歌手比赛的舞台，其中两人获得三等奖。
    演出队不仅为基层送歌送舞，还是一个综合性的文化服务队。每到一个连队，舞蹈演员教战士们跳起了集体舞，歌手们一招一势地辅导歌咏骨干，乐队为演唱组培养乐手，舞美队员忙着美化布置俱乐部。
    官兵们热情地称他们是“导弹阵地上的乌兰牧骑”。前不久，总政文化部赠给演出队一面绣有“神剑卫祖国，高歌壮军威”的锦旗。
