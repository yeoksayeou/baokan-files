Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 9 — The Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing from November 6 to 9, 1989.

Before the plenary session, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee held a Central Work Conference from October 30 to November 3, seriously discussing and studying the current economic issues in China.

The plenary session reviewed and passed the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Rectification and Deepening of Reform."

The plenary session pointed out that over the past decade since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, we have focused on economic construction, adhered to the four cardinal principles, and persisted in reform and opening up. The national economy has sustained development, the country's economic strength has significantly increased, the living standards of urban and rural residents have improved markedly, and all undertakings have achieved great successes. The overall appearance of the country has undergone profound historical changes. At the same time, China's economy faces many problems and difficulties in its progress. These problems and difficulties have accumulated over many years. In terms of the nature of the difficulties we currently face, they are difficulties encountered in the process of progress, temporary difficulties, and difficulties that can be completely overcome with the right conditions.

The plenary session believes that the decision made at the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee to rectify and deepen the reform of the national economy is correct. After a year of efforts, rectification and deepening of the reform have achieved initial results: the overly high rate of industrial development has been reduced, agriculture has had a good harvest, fixed asset investment has been controlled, the upward trend of price increases has slowed, currency has been recovered, and the national economy continues to develop. The plenary session believes that continuing to firmly implement the policy of rectification and deepening of the reform is the fundamental way to overcome current economic difficulties and achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy.

The plenary session decided that, including this year, it will take three years or a bit longer to basically complete the task of rectification and deepening of the reform. The main goals of rectification and deepening of the reform are: to gradually reduce the inflation rate, making the national retail price increase rate drop to below 10%; to reverse the situation of excessive currency issuance, gradually making the annual currency issuance volume match the reasonable demand of economic growth; to strive to achieve a balanced budget, gradually eliminating the budget deficit; based on improving economic efficiency, economic quality, and technological level, to maintain a moderate economic growth rate, aiming for an average annual increase of 5% to 6% in the national gross domestic product; to improve the unreasonable industrial structure, striving for a gradual increase in the production of major agricultural products, and gradually easing the contradictions of tight supply of energy, raw materials, and insufficient transportation capacity; to further deepen and improve various reform measures, gradually establishing a macro-control system that combines planned economy with market regulation, using economic, administrative, and legal means comprehensively.

The plenary session emphasized that whether during the period of rectification and deepening of the reform or after the completion of the task of rectification and deepening of the reform, we must always adhere to the policy of sustained, stable, and coordinated economic development. This is the most important experience and lesson drawn from China's 40 years of economic construction. At any time, we must adhere to the basic national conditions, firmly establish the guiding ideology of sustained, stable, and coordinated development, resolutely prevent the pursuit of overly high development rates, and always place the improvement of economic efficiency in the primary position of economic work.

The plenary session requires that rectification and deepening of the reform must focus on four key links. First, continue to reduce total social demand, insist on implementing a tight fiscal and credit policy, solve the problem of excessive national income distribution, and be determined to have a few years of hardship. Second, vigorously adjust the industrial structure, increase effective supply, and enhance the momentum for economic development. In particular, quickly create a nationwide atmosphere of valuing, supporting, and developing agriculture, and work together to improve agriculture, ensuring the stable growth of major agricultural products such as grain and cotton. Third, seriously rectify the economic order, continue to invest a lot of effort in cleaning up and rectifying various companies, especially in the circulation sector, and overcome the serious chaos in the fields of production, construction, circulation, and distribution. Fourth, deeply carry out the campaign of increasing production and saving, focus on improving enterprise management, tap internal potential, improve technological level, and take the road of economic development with less investment, more output, high quality, and high efficiency.

The plenary session emphasized that China's economic system reform is the self-improvement of the socialist economic system. We must correctly understand and handle the relationship between rectification and deepening of the reform. Rectification and deepening of the reform will not only create the necessary conditions for the in-depth and healthy development of reform but also need the support of reform. During the period of focusing on rectification and deepening of the reform, reform should be carried out around rectification and deepening of the reform and serve it. Those who are not active in rectification and deepening of the reform are also not active in reform. Currently, we should focus on deepening and improving the reform in areas such as enterprise contract responsibility system, fiscal contracting system, financial system, and foreign trade contracting system. We must continue to adhere to the policy of opening up to the outside world, actively use foreign capital and introduce advanced technology, and more effectively expand foreign trade and economic and technological exchanges. The basic policies and measures for special economic zones and coastal open areas will remain unchanged and will be gradually improved in practice.

The plenary session pointed out that we must give full play to our political advantages and strengthen the Party's leadership over rectification and deepening of the reform. Party organizations at all levels should guide the broad masses of Party members and cadres to correctly understand the current economic situation, fully understand the favorable conditions for overcoming difficulties, enhance confidence, and unite and struggle. We must firmly establish the ideology of the whole country as one chessboard, with local interests subordinated to overall interests and small interests subordinated to big interests, strengthen organizational discipline, and resolutely oppose regionalism. We must resolutely overcome corruption, strengthen the construction of clean government and Party style. Leading cadres at all levels must adhere to the mass line, improve their work style, serve the people wholeheartedly, and take the lead in fighting against all corrupt practices. We must strengthen Party's ideological and political work, and carry out the education and struggle to uphold the four cardinal principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization for a long time.

The plenary session discussed and passed the "Decision of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Approving Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Resignation as Chairman of the Central Military Commission."

The plenary session believes that Comrade Deng Xiaoping, for the fundamental interests of the Party and the state, resigned from his current position while still in good health, realizing his long-standing wish to completely retire from leadership positions, showing the broad-mindedness of a great proletarian revolutionary. All the attendees expressed their high respect for his exemplary role in advocating the abolition of the lifelong tenure of leading cadres.

The plenary session highly praised Comrade Deng Xiaoping's outstanding contributions to our Party and country. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is a highly respected outstanding leader recognized by all ethnic groups in China. He has made significant contributions in all historical periods of the revolution and construction led by the Party. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has become the core of the second generation of the Party's leadership. Over the past decade, in all aspects of the Party's and military's work, in economic construction and reform and opening up, in striving to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland and diplomatic activities, Comrade Deng Xiaoping is undoubtedly the chief architect. Under the strong leadership of the leadership collective with him as the core, the Chinese people have achieved remarkable results in the construction of socialist modernization, opening up a new era in the history of New China. Decades of revolutionary practice have shown that Comrade Deng Xiaoping is indeed an outstanding Marxist, a firm communist, an outstanding proletarian revolutionary, politician, and military strategist, and a tested leader of our Party, state, and military.

The plenary session emphasized that the series of viewpoints and theories proposed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping based on the principle of combining Marxism-Leninism with Chinese reality, especially the basic theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, is an important part of Mao Zedong Thought, a continuation and development of Mao Zedong Thought under new historical conditions, and a precious spiritual wealth of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people. The plenary session requires the entire Party to seriously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's works, making them play a significant guiding role in the great process of China's socialist modernization construction in the future.

The plenary session, after thorough deliberation, decided that Comrade Jiang Zemin would serve as Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Comrade Yang Shangkun as First Vice Chairman, Comrade Liu Huaqing as Vice Chairman, and Comrade Yang Baibing as Secretary of the Central Military Commission; and decided to add Comrade Yang Baibing as a member of the Secretariat.

A total of 167 members of the Central Committee and 106 alternate members of the Central Committee attended this plenary session. Attending this plenary session as non-voting participants were 183 members of the Central Advisory Commission, 67 members of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, and 53 responsible comrades from relevant departments. General Secretary of the Central Committee, Comrade Jiang Zemin, made an important speech at the end of the plenary session.

The plenary session called on the entire Party and people of all ethnic groups across the country to closely unite around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, to be full of confidence, to work together, to carry forward the glorious tradition of self-reliance, hard work, and sharing weal and woe, to overcome temporary economic difficulties, to achieve the strategic goal of doubling the national gross domestic product by the end of this century, to advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and to strive unremittingly.

    新华社北京11月9日电　中国共产党第十三届中央委员会第五次全体会议公报
    （1989年11月9日通过）
    中国共产党第十三届中央委员会第五次全体会议，1989年11月6日至9日在北京召开。
    全会之前，中央政治局于10月30日至11月3日召开了中央工作会议，认真讨论和研究了我国当前的经济问题。
    全会审议并通过了《中共中央关于进一步治理整顿和深化改革的决定》。
    全会指出，党的十一届三中全会以来的十年中，我们以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，国民经济持续发展，国家经济实力显著增强，城乡居民生活明显改善，各项事业都取得了巨大成就，整个国家的面貌发生了深刻的历史性变化。同时，我国经济在前进中也存在着许多的问题和困难。这些问题和困难是多年积累下来的。就我们目前面临困难的性质来说，是前进中的困难，暂时的困难，是完全有条件加以克服的。
    全会认为，党的十三届三中全会决定对国民经济进行治理整顿是正确的。经过一年来的努力，治理整顿已取得初步成效：过高的工业发展速度降了下来，农业获得较好收成，固定资产投资有所控制，物价上涨势头趋于缓和，货币回笼情况比较好，国民经济在继续发展。全会认为，继续坚定不移地执行治理整顿和深化改革的方针，是克服当前经济困难，实现国民经济持续、稳定、协调发展的根本途径。
    全会决定，包括今年在内，用三年或者更长一点的时间，基本完成治理整顿任务。治理整顿的主要目标是：逐步降低通货膨胀率，使全国零售物价上涨幅度逐步下降到10％以下；扭转货币超经济发行的状况，逐步做到当年货币发行量与经济增长的合理需求相适应；努力实现财政收支平衡，逐步消灭财政赤字；在着力提高经济效益、经济素质和科技水平的基础上，保持适度的经济增长率，争取国民生产总值平均每年增长5％至6％；改善产业结构不合理状况，力争主要农产品生产逐步增长，能源、原材料供应紧张和运力不足的矛盾逐步缓解；进一步深化和完善各项改革措施，逐步建立符合计划经济与市场调节相结合原则的，经济、行政、法律手段综合运用的宏观调控体系。
    全会强调指出，无论是治理整顿期间还是治理整顿任务完成之后，都必须始终坚持长期持续、稳定、协调发展经济的方针，这是总结我国40年的经济建设得出的最重要的经验教训。我们任何时候都必须坚持从我国的基本国情出发，牢固树立持续、稳定、协调发展的指导思想，坚决防止片面追求过高的发展速度，始终把不断提高经济效益放到经济工作的首要位置上来。
    全会要求，治理整顿必须抓住四个重要环节。一是，继续压缩社会总需求，坚持执行紧缩财政和信贷的方针，解决好国民收入超额分配的问题，下决心过几年紧日子。二是，大力调整产业结构，增加有效供给，增强经济发展后劲。特别是要迅速在全党全国造成一个重视农业、支援农业和发展农业的热潮，齐心合力把农业搞上去，确保粮食、棉花等主要农产品的稳定增长。三是，认真整顿经济秩序，继续下大力量清理整顿各种公司特别是流通领域的公司，克服生产、建设、流通、分配领域的严重混乱现象。四是，深入开展增产节约、增收节支运动，下功夫改进企业的经营管理，挖掘内部潜力，提高科技水平，走投入少、产出多、质量高、效益好的经济发展路子。
    全会强调，我国的经济体制改革，是社会主义经济制度的自我完善。必须正确认识和处理治理整顿和深化改革的关系。治理整顿不仅将为改革深入和健康地进行创造必要的条件，而且它本身也需要改革的配合。在集中力量进行治理整顿期间，改革要围绕治理整顿来进行，并为它服务。对治理整顿不积极，就是对改革不积极。当前，要着重在企业承包经营责任制、财政包干体制、金融体制、外贸承包制等方面深化和完善改革。必须继续坚持对外开放的方针，积极利用外资和引进先进技术，更有成效地扩展对外贸易和经济技术交流。经济特区和沿海开放地区的基本政策措施不变，并在实践中逐步加以完善。
    全会指出，必须充分发挥我们的政治优势，切实加强党对治理整顿和深化改革的领导。各级党组织要引导广大党员干部正确认识当前经济形势，充分认识克服困难的有利条件，增强信心，团结奋斗。必须牢固树立全国一盘棋思想，局部服从整体，小局服从大局，加强组织纪律性，坚决反对分散主义。必须坚决克服腐败现象，切实加强廉政建设和党风建设。各级领导干部必须坚持群众路线，改进领导作风，全心全意为人民服务，带头同一切腐败现象作坚决的斗争。必须大力加强党的思想政治工作，把坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育和斗争长期地进行下去。
    全会讨论并通过了《中国共产党十三届五中全会关于同意邓小平同志辞去中共中央军事委员会主席职务的决定》。
    全会认为，邓小平同志从党和国家的根本利益出发，在自己身体还健康的时候辞去现任职务，实现他多年来一再提出的从领导岗位上完全退下来的夙愿，表现了一个伟大的无产阶级革命家的广阔胸怀。与会全体同志对他身体力行地为废除干部领导职务终身制作出的表率，表示崇高的敬意。
    全会高度评价邓小平同志对我们党和国家建立的卓著功勋。邓小平同志是我国各族人民公认的享有崇高威望的杰出领导人，在党所领导的革命和建设的各个历史时期都做出了重大贡献。特别是党的十一届三中全会后，邓小平同志成为我们党第二代领导集体的核心。十年来，在我们党和军队工作的各个方面，在经济建设和改革开放方面，在努力实现和平统一祖国和外交活动方面，邓小平同志都是当之无愧的总设计师。在以他为核心的领导集体的坚强领导下，我国人民在社会主义现代化建设中取得了举世瞩目的成就，在社会主义新中国的历史上开创了一个新的时期。几十年来的革命实践表明，邓小平同志不愧是杰出的马克思主义者，坚定的共产主义者，卓越的无产阶级革命家、政治家、军事家，我们党、国家和军队久经考验的领导人。
    全会强调指出，邓小平同志根据马克思列宁主义同中国实际相结合的原则提出的一系列观点和理论，特别是建设有中国特色的社会主义的基本理论，是毛泽东思想的重要组成部分，是毛泽东思想在新的历史条件下的继承和发展，是中国共产党和中国人民的宝贵精神财富。全会要求全党一定要认真学习邓小平同志的著作，使它今后在我国社会主义现代化建设的伟大进程中发挥重大的指导作用。
    全会在充分酝酿的基础上，决定江泽民同志为中共中央军事委员会主席，杨尚昆同志为中共中央军事委员会第一副主席，刘华清同志为中共中央军事委员会副主席，杨白冰同志为中共中央军事委员会秘书长；决定增补杨白冰同志为中共中央书记处书记。
    出席这次全会的中央委员167人，候补中央委员106人。列席这次全会的有中央顾问委员会委员183人，中央纪律检查委员会委员67人，有关方面负责同志53人。中共中央总书记江泽民同志在全会结束时作了重要讲话。
    全会号召，全党全国各族人民紧密团结在以江泽民同志为核心的党中央周围，满怀信心，齐心协力，发扬自力更生、艰苦创业、同甘共苦的光荣传统，为克服经济的暂时困难，为实现到本世纪末国民生产总值翻两番的战略目标，为把建设具有中国特色的社会主义伟大事业推向前进，坚持不懈地努力奋斗！（附图片）
