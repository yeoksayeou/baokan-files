The Compassionate Doctor: A Tribute to Li Yongmou, Director of Shanghewan Hospital, Jilin Province

By Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Mingxing and Yang Hongyu

In a small town on the banks of the Songhua River, where four counties and cities meet, there is a doctor who is highly praised by people within a radius of several dozen miles. They tell stories of his selfless dedication to saving the lives of farmers.

He is Li Yongmou, director of Shanghewan Hospital in JiuTai City, Jilin Province, and a provincial model communist party member.

“Do What the People Need”

In the summer of the 1970s, 24-year-old Li Yongmou graduated from the external medicine department of the Baiqianen Medical University and came to the most remote Three-Tai Central Health Center in JiuTai City.

One day, a blizzard was raging. A farmer dragged his wife, who was bleeding heavily after childbirth, to the health center on a sled. However, there was no gynecologist at the hospital, so the farmer had to leave with his wife. Li Yongmou watched as the sled disappeared into the vast snow, his heart aching. From that day on, he decided to study obstetrics and gynecology.

He returned to his alma mater, consulted with experts, and collected materials; he went to the obstetrics and gynecology hospital, sought guidance from masters, and practiced clinically. His efforts paid off. In less than a year, he had mastered the diagnosis and treatment techniques for common and difficult gynecological diseases.

Once, while on a medical tour in YuDian Village, Li Yongmou encountered a young woman named Wu Xiumei who was bleeding heavily after childbirth. She was barely breathing and her face was pale. Li Yongmou diagnosed her condition as retained placenta. He quickly removed the placenta and stopped the bleeding. Due to excessive blood loss, she needed a transfusion immediately. Several farmers with matching blood types donated blood, but it was not enough. “I am also type O!” Li Yongmou did not hesitate, rolling up his sleeve. 200cc of fresh blood flowed from his veins into the patient's body. The patient's face gradually regained its color, and she was out of danger.

In the Yongfeng Second Team, farmer Xing Chunshu drove his wife, who was about to give birth, to the hospital. The journey was bumpy, and the baby was born in the cart. However, the baby was lifeless, with no sign of breathing. The mother was crying desperately. Xing Chunshu hurriedly found Dr. Li. Li Yongmou saw that the baby was suffering from “asphyxia.” Without hesitation, he put his mouth to the baby's mouth and breathed into it, sucking out the amniotic fluid and meconium. “Wah!” The baby finally cried out!

Day after day, year after year, Li Yongmou saved thousands of infants and women from the clutches of death in his ten years at Three-Tai.

He was fearless in saving critically ill patients. At the Shanghewan Power Supply Station, Shi Naichang fell into a well while digging. He landed on a steel bar ten meters deep from the wellhead, with the steel bar piercing his anus more than a foot deep. When he was brought to the hospital, he was already unconscious in a pool of blood, with barely a breath. Surgery was necessary immediately. However, the hospital's conditions were poor for such a major operation, and if the patient did not survive the surgery, what would happen? But the patient's condition did not allow for a transfer.

Li Yongmou made a decisive decision: “Operate!” He quickly formulated several plans and made detailed arrangements. After opening the abdomen, he found that the steel bar had reached the diaphragm, puncturing the rectum in four places, and the abdominal cavity was filled with feces and blood, emitting a foul odor. He first rinsed the feces with saline, then sutured the rectal tear. Each stitch took dozens of minutes. A thin thread connected life and death, and the slightest carelessness could cost a life. Outside the window, the snow was falling heavily, and inside the room, the air was thick and suffocating. Li Yongmou was so breathless that sweat kept dripping from his forehead. It was deep into the night, and the snow had stopped. The extremely difficult operation finally ended after 7 hours! Shi Naichang was saved, but Li Yongmou was exhausted.

Later, Shi Naichang went to Changchun for a check-up. The doctors there did not believe that a small hospital in Shanghewan could perform such a major operation. However, during the X-ray, they found that the scars were all in place and healing well, and they were genuinely convinced.

Non-stop 36 hours

To save patients, Li Yongmou braved the wind and rain, always ready to respond to calls.

One day, after a full day of work in YuDian Village, Li Yongmou was about to go home for dinner. However, Li Xingqi from Zhangjia Village ran in, saying his wife was in labor. Li Yongmou immediately went to Li's house. He worked until midnight, and only when the mother and child were safe did his heart settle. At that moment, he suddenly felt a strong dizziness, his body weak, and his forehead hot. His temperature was 39.5 degrees. He supported himself back home, took a painkiller, and fell asleep.

At 2 a.m. the next day, there was another urgent knock on the door. It was Li Shaoyou from the Fifth Team in Taoli, who had come to find him for another difficult birth. Despite his illness, Li Yongmou gritted his teeth, got up, packed his medical bag, and rushed to Taoli. He worked for several more hours, and by the time the baby cried out, it was dawn. The mother and child were both safe.

At 8 a.m., just as Li Yongmou was about to have breakfast, the party secretary of Three-Tai rushed in: there had been a landslide at the LiJiayao Reservoir construction site, injuring people. Saving people is like putting out a fire. Li Yongmou immediately put down his bowl, got on his bike, and rushed 20 miles to the construction site, saving two severely injured farmers who had gone into shock.

Three consecutive battles, two days and one night, 36 hours, Li Yongmou had not eaten or drunk anything, had a high fever, and saved six lives! But he himself collapsed. This was not an ordinary battle! It showcased the spirit of a communist party member who “serves the people wholeheartedly” and shone with the light of communist ideology of “selflessness and dedication to others”!

He has been a “father” and a “matchmaker”

The people say that Li Yongmou treats his patients as if they were his own family. Elders treat him as a son, peers as a brother, and many younger people affectionately call him “Dry Father” or “Father.”

Wang Guoqing, a young man from Three-Tai, always calls Dr. Li “Father.” One day, 18-year-old Wang Guoqing was driving a cow cart for the production team when his foot was trampled by the cow, leading to tetanus. His father took him to Changchun, where he stayed in the hospital for 9 days, but his high fever did not subside, and he was unconscious. Losing hope, his father brought him back to Three-Tai and sent him to the health center, telling Li Yongmou, “When he is gone, let me know!” and left. “What a father!” Li Yongmou was both angry and anxious, and immediately began emergency treatment, giving Wang Guoqing injections, medicine, and nasogastric feeding, and staying by his side, taking care of him. Wang Guoqing gradually improved: on the first day, the convulsions stopped; on the second day, the high fever subsided; on the third day, his breathing was even; on the fourth day, he regained consciousness. Wang Guoqing's father saw his son lively and healthy, overjoyed, and tears streamed down his face. He couldn't say whether it was joy or guilt, and told his son, “Father is sorry to you, don't call me father anymore, just call Li Daifu father!” This “father” title has been called for 13 years to this day.

Li Yongmou has also been a matchmaker. In September 1986, Liu Shurong, a young woman from Qing Mountain Village in LiuTai Township, was heavily pregnant and sent by her father to Shanghewan Hospital. This girl did not know what disease she had, and her stomach had been swelling like a balloon for several months. The patient could not afford a single cent. The girl's father told Li Yongmou, “Please help find a family for the girl. If they can afford the treatment, she will marry him after she is cured!” This was a difficult task for Li Yongmou. He had to mobilize all the hospital staff to find a suitable match. An old bachelor came to ask, “Can the girl's disease be cured? Will it be a waste of money?” Li Yongmou heard this and immediately refused.

Finally, a man in his early thirties came to see Li Yongmou: “I have money, let's treat her. If she is cured, it's fate; if not, I will buy her some clothes and send her off!” In the end, this fateful marriage really happened. The girl had an ovarian cyst. After the surgery, Li Yongmou removed a 42-pound tumor from her. More than 20 days later, she was discharged from the hospital. On the day of the wedding, the newlyweds visited every room in the hospital, distributing wedding candy.

“An Unqualified Husband and Father”

Three-Tai Township, ten years of cold and heat, Shanghewan, another ten years of autumn and spring. Li Yongmou dedicated his entire being to the people on this land nourished by the Songhua River. In 20 years, he treated more than 300,000 patients, saved more than 2,000 critically ill patients, performed more than 20,000 surgeries, and had no medical accidents. People say he is full of passion for his patients and is a doctor who deserves full marks; but for his own family, he is an unqualified husband and father.

Indeed, Li Yongmou's wife, Zhao Shuqin, often says, “In his heart, patients are gods, but we few women are often not in his thoughts.”

Little Zhao and Yongmou were sweethearts and classmates for 12 years. After graduating from middle school, Li Yongmou was admitted to a prestigious medical university. Little Zhao was happy: in the future, he would stay in the city, and she could also benefit. However, Yongmou went to the city with his luggage and then returned to the countryside with his luggage. She waited for him for 8 years before they got married, and she accepted that he was a country doctor. However, she did not expect to endure so much hardship. Yongmou was often out on medical tours, covering every village and hamlet; when he returned home, he was quickly called away again. All the household chores fell on Little Zhao's shoulders. Especially when the children were sick, she was most anxious.

One winter, her youngest son had pneumonia with a high fever of 40 degrees. Li Yongmou had not been home for a month. Unable to find a doctor, Little Zhao went to the broadcasting station and used the loudspeaker to call for Li Yongmou, but she couldn't bring him back. In fact, Li Yongmou heard the loudspeaker's call, but at that time, he was on the sterilization operation table in Xigou Village. It was not until late at night that he returned home. As soon as he entered the door, he saw his wife holding their youngest son, crying. Guilty, Li Yongmou immediately went to the health center, brought medicine, and gave the child an injection. The next morning, he left again. Little Zhao washed diapers while wiping her tears: other families without a doctor find it easy to see a doctor and call for one anytime; our own family has a doctor, but it's hard to find one!

Another time, Zhao Shuqin's leg was broken in a motorcycle accident and she couldn't walk. Li Yongmou was busy with the hospital's construction and treating patients, and he was nowhere to be seen all day. Zhao Shuqin was injured at home, and for two days, she didn't have a proper meal. She couldn't help but scold her husband: “You don't have me in your heart, marrying you, I've had bad luck for eight generations!” Although she scolded, she still did her duty as a good wife. Because although she had grievances, she had a deeper understanding of her husband. She knew that her husband's heart was filled with 200,000 fellow villagers, and when he was helping patients relieve their pain, that was when he was happiest.

Li Yongmou was also careless about himself. A few years ago, his heart often ached. However, he kept it a secret. It was not until he went to Changchun for a meeting and could no longer bear the pain that he went to a hospital for a check-up and was diagnosed with viral myocarditis. The hospital advised him to be hospitalized for treatment. He refused and only agreed to be hospitalized under the “force” of his colleagues. But he was “in the camp but his heart was elsewhere,” always thinking about the patients in Shanghewan. Less than half a month later, he insisted on leaving the hospital and returning to his post. He carried painkillers and fever reducers with him. Whenever he felt pain, he would take some painkillers and continue to work; when he felt feverish, he would take some fever reducers and continue to fight. His wife scolded him lovingly: “Others call it a disease, but you don't call it a disease!”

Li Yongmou's sincerity earned him the deep love of the masses. Whoever had good cabbage would definitely send some to Li Daifu's family; whoever made yellow rice and pork would invite Li Daifu to taste it; whoever picked fruits or caught fresh fish would not forget Li Daifu. Once, he carried a basket to the market to buy celery. Those farmers selling vegetables at the market, each one, put some in his basket. After that, Li Yongmou dared not “personally” buy vegetables again.

Shanghewan People Are at Ease

The people love him and feel they cannot do without him. Because he has become the backbone of everyone, not only do they seek him for medical treatment, but many other difficulties also need his help. When family planning work stalled, the leaders of Shanghewan Town asked him to speak, and everyone followed his advice; some farmers sold grain at high prices to individual businessmen, and the town leaders asked him to do some work, and everyone sold the grain to the state; when public grain was covered by snow, some farmers did not go to retrieve it, but when they heard that Dr. Li had come, everyone went to “dig grain in the snow.”

No wonder the farmers say Dr. Li is a great treasure of Shanghewan; the town leaders say he is a shining pearl, shining wherever he is placed. Therefore, in recent years, there have been repeated incidents of “stealing the pearl and digging the treasure.” The health department of JiuTai City has twice sent letters to transfer him to the city; the provincial tuberculosis hospital has repeatedly requested him; an old classmate from the FuYu Oilfield Hospital has “visited him three times” to invite him to “come out of seclusion”… All the places that wanted to transfer him had better living and working conditions, political and economic treatment. However, he politely declined. Despite this, the masses and the town leaders still felt like they were holding a “rabbit,” and whenever someone from above came to find him, they worried that he would be transferred. Li Yongmou solemnly declared at the party member and cadre meeting: “My youth is here, my career is here, the people here need me, my heart will always be here! Shanghewan is the best position in my life. Wherever there is yellow soil, I will dedicate my bones to this land, to the people of this land! After my death, please bury me on the southern hill of Shanghewan, so that I can be forever with the people here!”

His heartfelt words stirred up a storm of applause.

　　药箱血肉情
　　——记吉林省九台市上河湾医院院长李永茂
　　新华社记者　陈明星　杨红雨
    在松花江畔一个四县市交界的小镇上，有这么一位医生，一提起他，方圆几十里各村屯的人都赞不绝口，传诵他为农民们救死扶伤的感人故事。
    他，就是吉林省九台市上河湾医院院长、省模范共产党员李永茂。
      “人民需要什么我就做什么”
    70年代第一夏，24岁的李永茂从白求恩医大外科专业毕业，来到九台市最偏僻的三台中心卫生院。
    一天，鹅毛大雪纷纷扬扬。一位农民用爬犁拉着产后大出血的妻子来到卫生院。可医院没有妇科大夫，农民只好拉着爬犁走了。李永茂望着逐渐消失在茫茫大雪中的爬犁车，心如针扎。从此，他决心进修妇产科。
    他回母校，请教专家，收集资料；到妇产院，拜师求教，临床实习。功夫不负有心人。不到一年，他就掌握了妇产科的常见病、疑难症的诊治技术。
    一次，在于店大队巡诊的李永茂遇到女知青吴秀梅产后大出血，呼吸微弱，面色青白。李永茂诊断为胎盘残留。他迅速取出胎盘，止住流血。因失血过多，必须马上输血。几个血型合适的农民献了血，还不够。“我也是O型！”李永茂不容分说，伸出了自己的胳膊，200CC鲜血从他的血管流入病人的身体。病人的脸上慢慢出现了红润，脱离了危险。
    玉丰二队农民邢春树驾车送临产的妻子去医院。一路颠簸，婴儿生在马车上。但这小生命如同死的一般，没有一丝声息。母亲急得直哭。邢春树慌忙找李大夫。李永茂一看，是
  “窒息”。他毫不犹豫地用自己的嘴对着婴儿的嘴，用力吸气，每吸一口，便是满嘴胎便、羊水。“哇”的一声，婴儿终于哭了出来！
    日复一日，年复一年，李永茂在三台的10年里，把数千婴儿、妇女从死神手中抢救回来。
    抢救危重病人，他敢于冒风险。上河湾农电所的石乃昌打井时掉进井里，正落在离井口十米深的钢筋头上，钢筋从他的肛门插进去一尺多深。人们把他送到医院时，他已经昏迷在血泊中，气如游丝了。必须马上手术。但做这种大手术，医院条件太差，万一病人下不了手术台怎么办？然而，病人的伤势已不允许转院了。
    李永茂当机立断：“做！”他迅速制定了几套方案，做了周密部署。打开腹腔后发现，钢筋直达横膈膜，把直肠捅了4个洞，腹腔内满是粪便、血水，臭气难闻。他先用生理盐水清粪，接着缝合直肠破洞。每缝一针，都要用几十分钟。一根细丝系着生死两端，稍有疏忽，便是一条命啊。窗外大雪纷飞，屋内浊气窒人。李永茂憋得几乎喘不过气来，额头不断渗出汗珠。夜深了，雪住了，极其艰苦的手术终于结束。用了整整7个小时！石乃昌得救了，可李永茂累趴下了。
    后来，石乃昌到长春复查，人家不相信上河湾的小医院能做这样的大手术，但透视时发现伤口痕迹都在，而且愈合良好，才由衷地折服了。
          马不停蹄的36小时
    为抢救病人，李永茂风雨无阻、随叫随到。
    有一天，下午5点，在于店大队出诊的李永茂已经累了一天，正准备回家吃晚饭。可张家大队的李星奇跑来了，说他妻子难产。李永茂即去李家。一直忙到半夜，李家母子平安，李永茂那颗悬着的心才落了地。这时，他忽然感到一阵强烈的晕眩，浑身无力，摸摸额头，滚烫滚烫，一量体温，发烧39.5度。他支撑着回到家里，吃了一片索密痛，就倒在床上。
    次日凌晨两点，又响起了一阵急促的敲门声，是套里五队李少有来找他，又是难产。病重的李永茂咬咬牙，爬了起来，背起药箱，骑上车，直奔套里。他又紧张抢救几个小时，东方吐出鱼肚白，婴儿“呱呱”落地，大人小孩无恙。
    八点多钟，李永茂刚要吃早饭，三台党委书记又火烧火燎地追来了：李家窑水库工地塌方，砸伤了人。救人如救火。李永茂立刻放下碗，骑上车，又是20多里，赶到工地，救活了已经休克的两位重伤农民。
    接连三场恶战，两昼一夜36小时，李永茂没吃没喝，带着高烧，救活6条性命！可是他自己一下瘫倒了。这不是普通的鏖战啊！它展现出一位共产党员“全心全意为人民”的风采，闪烁着他“毫不利己，专门利人”的共产主义思想光辉！
    当过一回“爹”嫁过一回“女”
    群众都说，李永茂对待病人，不是亲人胜似亲人。长辈人把他看作亲儿子，同辈人将他当成亲兄弟，许多小字辈则亲昵地叫他“干老”、“爹”。
    三台的青年王国强就一直管李大夫叫“爹”。一天，18岁的王国强，赶着牛车给生产队拉粪，脚被牛踩破了，感染了破伤风。父亲把他送到长春，住院9天，仍然高烧不退，昏迷不醒，眼看不行了。失去信心的父亲，把儿子拉回三台，送到卫生院，对李永茂说：“等他不行了，告诉俺一声得啦！”扔下儿子，走了。“这个当爹的！”李永茂又气又急，马上紧急救治，给王国强打针，服药，做
  “鼻饲”，并守在他身边，精心护理。王国强逐渐好转：第一天，抽搐停止；第二天，高热消退；第三天，呼吸均匀；第四天，神智清楚了。王国强的父亲看到儿子活泼、健康，喜出望外，禁不住热泪横流，说不清是喜还是愧，对儿子说：“爹对不起你呀，你别管俺叫爹了，就管李大夫叫爹吧！”这个“爹”的称呼，就一直叫到13年后的今天。
    李永茂还嫁过一回“姑娘”呢。那是1986年9月，六台乡青山村女青年刘淑荣挺着大肚子，由父亲送来上河湾医院。这位姑娘不知得了什么病，几个月前肚子像吹气似的，一天天大起来。病人又拿不出一分钱。姑娘的父亲对李永茂说：“你们就帮忙给姑娘找个人家吧，只要能出钱治病，治好了，就嫁给他！”这可难坏了李永茂。他只好发动医院全体职工帮着物色。有个老光棍来问：“姑娘的病能治好吗？会不会人财两空呀？”李永茂一听就回绝了。
    最后，一位30出头的青年来找李永茂：“我有钱，给她治病吧。治好了，算我俩有缘；治不好，我也给她买套衣服，送送她！”结果，这对生死姻缘真的成了。姑娘患的是卵巢囊肿。经过手术，李永茂为她取出了42斤的大肿块。20多天后，她痊愈出院。结婚那天，这对新人双双来到医院，挨屋发喜糖。
        “不及格的丈夫和父亲”
    三台乡十度寒暑，上河湾又十载秋春。李永茂在这块松花江滋润的土地上，把自己的全部身心献给了人民。20年来，他治疗病人30多万人次，抢救危患2000多人次，手术2万多例，无一例医疗事故。人们说他对病人满腔热忱，是个可以得满分的医生；而对自己的家庭，他却是一个不及格的丈夫和父亲。
    的确如此。李永茂的妻子赵淑琴常说：“在他心里，病人都是上帝，唯独我们娘几个，他常常没放在心上。”
    小赵和永茂青梅竹马，同窗12年。中学毕业后，李永茂考上名牌医科大学。小赵心里高兴：将来他留了城，自己也可以借借光。没想到，永茂背着行李进城，又背着行李回乡了。等了他8年才结婚，等着个回乡郎中，小赵也认了，可没想到跟着他要吃那么多苦。永茂常年出诊在外，跑遍四邻八乡、村村屯屯；回到家，很快又被叫走。家务重担全落在小赵肩上。特别是孩子们生病时，她最为焦虑。
    一年冬天，小儿子得了肺炎，高烧40度。李永茂已经一个月没在家了。找不到医生的小赵，只好到广播站，用喇叭找李永茂，也没能把他喊回来。其实，喇叭的喊声李永茂倒是听到了，可他当时正在西沟大队的绝育手术台上。直到深夜，他才回家。一进门，他看见妻子抱着小儿子在掉泪。愧疚的李永茂立即去卫生所，给孩子拿来药，打了针，第二天一早又走了。小赵一边洗尿布，一边抹眼泪：人家家里没大夫，看病倒容易，找大夫随叫随到；我们自己家里有大夫，看病却找不到大夫！
    还有一次，赵淑琴的腿被摩托车撞得骨折了，不能走路。李永茂抓医院的修建，又忙于为患者治病，整天看不到他的人影。小赵在家里养伤，竟然两天没吃上一顿正经饭。她忍不住骂丈夫：“你心里就是没有我，找你这个丈夫，我算倒了八辈子霉！”骂归骂，做归做。赵淑琴还是一如既往地做着丈夫的贤内助。因为她心里虽有委屈，但更多的还是对丈夫深深的理解。她知道，丈夫心中装的是20万父老乡亲，当他在帮助病人解除痛苦的时候，才是他最幸福的时候。
    李永茂对自己更是马马虎虎了。前年，他的心脏常常隐隐作痛，可他“保密”。直到他去长春开会，实在疼痛难忍，他才顺便在一家医院看了看，被诊断为病毒性心肌炎。医院让他住院治疗。他不肯，在医院同志的“强迫”下才住了院。但他“身在曹营心在汉”，心中总是惦记着上河湾的病人。不到半个月，他硬吵着出了院，回到岗位上。他随身带着止痛片、退烧药。觉得哪里痛，他就吃点止痛片，继续工作；感到发烧了，他就服些退烧药，照常战斗。妻子心疼地嗔怪他：“人家有病叫病，你有病就不叫病啦！”
    李永茂的赤诚之心，换来了广大群众的深切爱戴。谁家的大白菜长得好，肯定要给李大夫家送去；哪家做了黄面干粮、猪头肉，总是叫李大夫来尝尝；收了水果、打了鲜鱼，更是忘不了李大夫。有一次，他拎着筐到集市上买芹菜。那些赶集卖菜的农民，你一把，他一捆，争先恐后地把芹菜塞到他筐里。打这以后，李永茂再也不敢“亲自”去买菜了。
          上河湾人放心了
    群众爱戴他，更觉得离不开他。因为他已成为大伙的“依墙骨”，不仅看病找他，其他许多难题也需要他解决。计划生育工作搁浅了，上河湾镇的领导请他去说说，大伙就按他的意见办；有些农民把粮高价卖给个体户，镇领导请他去做工作，大伙就把粮食卖给国家了；公家的粮被大雪覆盖了，有的农民不去抢粮，但听说李大夫来了，大伙便自动去“雪中扒粮”。
    难怪，农民们说李大夫是上河湾的一大“宝”；镇领导说他是一颗“明珠”，放在哪里都闪光。因而近几年来，连续发生“抢珠挖宝”的风波。九台市卫生部门曾两次发函，要调他到市里工作；省结核病院多次指名要他；扶余油田医院的一个老同学“三顾茅庐”，请他“出山”……所有想调他去的地方，生活、工作条件，政治、经济待遇都比这里强得多。然而，他都婉言谢绝了。尽管如此，群众和镇领导怀里仍像揣了一只“兔子”，只要上面来人找他，就担心他被调走。李永茂在党员干部大会上庄重宣布：“我的青春在这里，我的事业在这里，这里的人民需要我，我的心永远在这里！上河湾就是我人生的最佳位置。哪里黄土不埋人，我这把骨头就献给这块土地，献给这块土地上的人民！我死后，请大伙把我埋在上河湾的南山上，我要与这里的人民永远在一起！”
    铿锵有力的肺腑之言，激起一阵阵暴风雨般的掌声。
                                      （新华社供本报专稿）
