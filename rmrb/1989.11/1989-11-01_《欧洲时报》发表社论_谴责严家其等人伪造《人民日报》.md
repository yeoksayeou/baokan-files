Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 31st.

Paris News: The Paris European Times published an editorial on October 27th titled "Such 'Elites' and Such Methods," condemning the despicable actions of Severance and others in forging the People's Daily.

The editorial states that the "Chinese Alliance" members in Paris recently launched their first campaign against the Chinese government, proudly presenting a forged copy of the People's Daily as their sole weapon. Apart from appropriating the name, masthead, and some headlines of the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, the entire content is filled with slanderous rumors and falsehoods aimed at attacking and defaming the Chinese government.

The editorial says that Severance and others have appropriated the name and layout of the People's Daily to confuse people abroad. They exploit the authority of this Chinese party newspaper to mislead foreign readers who are not well-informed about China, making them mistakenly believe that the opposition forces in China are strong enough to control a major newspaper's discourse. This, in turn, leads them to mistakenly believe that the Chinese government is unstable, thereby creating a market for their fabricated lies. As the political situation and public sentiment in China stabilize, their lies are becoming less believable. Their other goal is to use the red pages of the People's Daily to smuggle their propaganda into the mainland, thereby inciting and stirring up trouble.

The editorial points out that this group of "democracy movement elites" who fled from China do not understand the rule of law and do not know how to establish democracy. Their appropriation of the name and layout of the People's Daily is a striking example. The overseas edition of the People's Daily is published and distributed by the French Guanghua Publishing Company, registered and printed in France. However, Severance and others, with utter disregard for the law, have appropriated its name and layout, passing off counterfeit goods as genuine, which is a serious infringement. From this, one can see that this group of "democracy movement elites," in order to achieve their selfish political goals, will disregard any legal system. One can also recall the development of the Beijing incident, where they disregarded social order, occupied Tiananmen Square, obstructed traffic, damaged vehicles, and eventually resorted to violence to block the martial law troops, burning military vehicles, looting weapons, and killing soldiers, resulting in heavy losses to the state and the people. In China and abroad, more and more people have come to realize that the entire incident was ruined by these radical "fighters" like Severance and Wu'erkaixi.

The editorial of the European Times concludes by pointing out that these so-called "elites," who do not understand the rule of law and democracy, are nothing but political hooligans. They envy and pursue Western lifestyles, but now that they are in the West, they do not engage in labor or work, like traveling quacks peddling fake medicines to sell their tricks, seeking the favor of some self-righteous foreigners and the meticulously planned Kuomintang in Taiwan. Such "elites" and such methods, what benefit do they bring to China?

### 《欧洲时报》发表社论  谴责严家其等人伪造《人民日报》

    《欧洲时报》发表社论
    谴责严家其等人伪造《人民日报》
    新华社北京10月31日电　巴黎消息：巴黎《欧洲时报》10月27日发表题为《如此“精英”如此手段》的社论，谴责严家其等人伪造《人民日报》的丑恶行径。
    社论说，在巴黎的“中国民阵”分子日前发起反对中国政府的第一个战役，自鸣得意地抛出唯一的法宝，是一份伪造的《人民日报》。除了盗用中国共产党机关报的名义、报头和部分标题外，满纸是攻击、污蔑中国政府的谣言和谰言。
  社论说，严家其们盗用《人民日报》的名义和版面，在海外，是利用这份中国党报的权威在外国人中混淆视听，使对中国不甚了解的外国读者误以为中国反对派力量强大，足以控制一份大报的言论，从而误以为中国政府是不稳定的，从而为他们私造的黑货寻觅市场。因为随着中国政局与人心的安定，他们的谎言越来越没人听了。他们的另一个目的是在国内，利用鲜红的《人民日报》的版面，可以蒙混过关，进入大陆，从而发挥蛊惑人心、煽风点火的作用。
    社论指出，从中国逃出来的这伙“民运精英”，本身不懂得法制，也不懂得如何建立民主。他们盗用《人民日报》的名义版面就是一个突出的例子。中国《人民日报》海外版是由法国光华报业公司代理和发行的，是在法国注册印行的。而今严家其们目无法制，盗用其名义和版面，拿假货冒充，本身就是严重的侵权行为。人们从此可以看到，这伙“民运精英”为了达到自私的政治目的，任何法制都会置之不顾。人们还可以回顾北京事件的发展过程，他们不顾社会秩序，强占天安门广场，阻碍交通，毁坏车辆最终发展至暴力阻拦戒严部队，抢烧军车，掠夺武器，残杀战士，导致国家和人民损失惨重的结果。在中国，在海外，越来越多的人都认识到，整个事件就是被严家其、吾尔开希这些激进的“斗士”搞坏的。
    《欧洲时报》的社论最后指出，严家其等这些所谓“精英”，不懂法制，不懂民主，不过是一伙政治流氓。他们羡慕和追求西方生活，现在到了西方，又不事稼穑，不肯劳动，就像走江湖的卖膏药者一样，不时造一些假膏药以售其奸，博取一些自以为是的外国人和处心积虑的台湾国民党的青睐。如此“精英”，如此手段，于中国又有何益呢？
