Li Peng and Ershad Hold Talks
Both Sides Sign Five Documents

	BEIJING, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) — Li Peng, Premier of the State Council, and President H.M. Ershad of Bangladesh held talks on board the presidential yacht on the Buriganga River this morning. The talks, which lasted nearly two hours, were friendly and fruitful. The two sides exchanged views on further developing bilateral relations and on regional and international issues of common concern.

	Ershad said that Li Peng's visit to Bangladesh would further promote the close and friendly relations between the two countries. He asked Li Peng to convey his warm greetings to Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Yang Shangkun.

	Ershad introduced Bangladesh's political and economic development policies, including land policy, industrial and commercial policy, and family planning policy. He said that the political situation in Bangladesh was stable, and the current policies were effective, but there were still some problems that could not be solved overnight.

	Ershad said that Bangladesh attached great importance to China's family planning policy and was willing to continue exchanging experiences in this regard.

	He said that to develop the economy, Bangladesh adopted an open policy and welcomed foreign investment, including from China.

	Ershad thanked the Chinese government and experts for their contributions to helping Bangladesh cope with floods. He said that Bangladesh had always attached importance to friendly relations with China and was satisfied with the development of bilateral relations. He hoped to further develop and expand exchanges and cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, transportation, and culture.

	Ershad suggested that the two sides hold consultations regularly to strengthen cooperation in bilateral relations and international affairs.

	On regional issues, Ershad said that Bangladesh hoped to maintain peace and stability in South Asia. On the world economic situation, Ershad welcomed South-South cooperation to enhance the self-reliance of developing countries.

	Li Peng highly praised the sincere friendship between the governments and peoples of the two countries.

	Li Peng conveyed the greetings of Yang Shangkun and other Chinese leaders to Ershad and, on behalf of Yang and himself, invited Ershad to visit China again at his convenience.

	Li Peng expressed sympathy for the frequent floods in Bangladesh. He said that China also suffered from floods and was willing to continue technical exchanges with Bangladesh on flood control and water management.

	Li Peng said that China would continue to work for the development of trade exchanges and economic cooperation between the two countries. He said that China would actively respond to Bangladesh's proposal for cooperation in the development of small and medium-sized enterprises.

	Li Peng agreed in principle to the establishment of a bilateral consultation mechanism, which could be flexible and diverse.

	Li Peng introduced China's views on the international situation and its foreign policy, saying that in recent years, the international situation had tended to ease, and the factors for peace were increasing. However, it was noteworthy that regional hotspots had not been completely resolved, and factors of instability still existed. The economic gap between the North and the South was widening, and some Western countries were using "human rights" and "freedom" as pretexts to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, which China firmly opposed. China would unswervingly pursue an independent and peaceful foreign policy and oppose all forms of hegemony.

	Li Peng said that to achieve the Four Modernizations, China needed a stable domestic situation and a peaceful international environment.

	Li Peng also briefed Ershad on the major decisions made by the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, introduced China's political and economic situation and related policies, including family planning and environmental protection policies.

	Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Foreign Minister Abdul Momen, and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin attended the talks.

	After the talks, the two countries signed five documents on board the yacht: the Agreement on Mutual Exemption of Visa Requirements, the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement, the Trade Agreement, the Exchange of Letters on the Feasibility Study of the Bridge, and the Long-Term Arrangement for China's Purchase of Urea from Bangladesh.

    李鹏同艾尔沙德举行会谈
    双方签署五个文件
    本报达卡11月18日电　记者史宗星报道：今天上午，李鹏总理和艾尔沙德总统在布里甘加河上的总统游艇上举行了近两个小时的正式会谈。双方就进一步发展双边关系问题和共同关心的地区和国际形势问题亲切友好地交换了意见。会谈是富有成果的。
    艾尔沙德总统说，李鹏总理此次对孟加拉国的访问，必将进一步加强孟中两国亲密无间的友好关系。艾尔沙德请李鹏转达他对邓小平、江泽民、杨尚昆的热情问候。
    艾尔沙德介绍了孟加拉国的政治、经济发展政策，包括土地政策、工商业政策和计划生育政策。他说，孟加拉国的政局是稳定的，现行政策是有成效的，但也有些问题，不可能在一夜之间都得到解决。
    艾尔沙德说，孟加拉国十分重视中国计划生育政策，愿意在这方面继续同中国交流经验。
    他说，为了发展经济，孟加拉国实行开放政策，欢迎包括中国在内的外国到孟加拉国投资。
    艾尔沙德感谢中国政府和中国专家为帮助孟加拉国治理洪水作出的贡献。他说，孟加拉国一向重视同中国的睦邻友好关系，对孟中双边关系发展表示满意，并希望进一步发展和扩大双方在经贸、交通和文化等领域里的交流与合作。
    艾尔沙德建议双方经常磋商，以加强两国在双边关系和国际事务中的合作。
    在谈到地区问题时，艾尔沙德说，孟加拉国希望南亚地区保持和平与稳定。关于世界经济问题，艾尔沙德表示欢迎南南合作，增强发展中国家自力更生的能力。
    李鹏总理高度赞扬中孟两国政府和两国人民之间的真诚友谊。
    李鹏转达了杨尚昆主席和其他中国高级领导人对艾尔沙德总统的问候，并以杨主席和他本人的名义，邀请艾尔沙德在方便的时候再次访华。
    李总理对孟加拉国经常遭受洪水之害表示同情。他说，中国也常有水患，中国愿意同孟加拉国在防洪治水方面继续进行技术交流。
    李鹏说，中国将继续为发展两国贸易交流与经济合作作出努力。对孟方提出的在发展中小企业方面发展合作的建议，中方将积极响应。
    李总理表示原则上同意建立双边磋商制度，方式可以灵活多样。
    李鹏在介绍中国政府对国际形势的看法和中国的外交政策时说，近年来，国际形势趋向缓和，和平的因素在增长，但值得注意的是，地区热点问题尚未完全解决，不安定因素依然存在，南北之间的经济差距还在拉大，一些西方国家还打着“人权”和“自由”等旗号，或利用其它借口干涉别国内政，这是我们坚决反对的。中国将坚定不移地执行独立自主的和平外交政策，反对各种形式的霸权主义。
    李鹏说，为了实现四个现代化，中国对内需要一个稳定的局势，对外需要一个和平的国际环境。
    李鹏总理还向艾尔沙德总统通报了中共十三届五中全会作出的重大决定，介绍了中国的政治、经济情况和有关政策，包括计划生育和环境保护政策。
    孟加拉国总理卡齐、外交部长阿尼斯和中国外交部长钱其琛、对外经贸部长郑拓彬等参加了会谈。
    会谈结束后，中孟两国政府在游艇上签署了五个文件，即中孟两国互免签证协定、经济技术合作协定、贸易协定、关于大桥可行性考察换文以及中国向孟加拉国购买尿素的长期安排。
