High-level officials from the European Community visited Hungary and Poland. The President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, and the President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, arrived in Budapest on the evening of the 16th for a one-day visit to Hungary.

The two high-level officials from the European Community stated that the purpose of their visit was to understand the situation in Hungary and the progress of its reforms. This is because the finance ministers of the European Community countries are about to discuss the economic situation in Hungary and Poland, and the provision of aid to the two countries by the 24 nations requires an understanding of the real situation in both countries.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn, during his talks with them, expressed that Hungary hopes to receive Western aid.

The European Community delegation, led by Dumas and Delors, left Warsaw after a one-day working visit to Poland on the 18th.

According to the Polish News Agency, the Polish side presented a memorandum from the Polish government to the European Community, outlining more detailed and specific requests for European Community aid. These requests include providing Poland with $10 billion in stabilization credit, starting to use loans from the European Investment Bank, establishing a Polish-European Bank, and deferring the repayment of foreign debt interest due from 1990 to 1992.

　　欧洲共同体高级官员访问匈波
    欧洲共同体部长理事会轮流主席、法国外交部长迪马和欧洲共同体委员会主席德洛尔于十六日晚抵达布达佩斯，对匈牙利进行一天的访问。
    欧洲共同体的这两位高级官员表示此行的目的是了解匈牙利的形势和理解匈改革的进程，因为欧洲共同体国家的财政部长们即将讨论匈牙利和波兰的经济形势，二十四国向匈、波提供援助也需了解两国的真实情况。
    匈外交部长霍恩同他们会谈时表示，匈牙利期望得到西方援助。
    由迪马和德洛尔率领的欧共体代表团十八日对波兰进行为期一天的工作访问后离开华沙。
    据波通社报道，波兰方面向欧共体提出一项波兰政府备忘录，就欧共体的援助提出了更加详细和具体的要求，其中包括向波兰提供十亿美元稳定信贷，开始动用欧洲投资银行贷款，建立波兰—欧洲银行，延期偿还一九九○—一九九二年到期的外债利息等。
