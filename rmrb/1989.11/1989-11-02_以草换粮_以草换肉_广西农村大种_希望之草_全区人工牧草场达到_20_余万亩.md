    "Exchanging grass for grain and meat" is no longer a mere dream for the farmers of Guangxi. With the development of artificial grass planting, the entire region now has over 200,000 acres of artificial pastures. Many mountain villagers have found a way to resolve the issue of humans and livestock competing for grain and to accelerate their steps towards poverty alleviation through the development of "hope grass."

    Guangxi is located in the subtropical zone, with hills and mountains covering nearly three-quarters of the region's total land area. The climate is mild, and the mountains are lush with grass, making it a natural pasture in the south. After investigations by relevant departments, it was discovered that the main reason farmers in the grass-rich western and northern mountainous areas of Guangxi have not yet taken steps to become prosperous is that they have not developed grass-eating poultry and livestock according to local conditions.

    The regional Party Committee and government, in response to this situation, promptly established grass development institutions, formed a poultry and livestock leadership group, and promoted the planting of pastures and the development of grass-eating poultry and livestock as an important path for mountain villagers to become prosperous.

    In the past, farmer Liang Xincai from Fudaxiang, Dianlin County, often worried about filling his stomach. In 1987, he planted 30 acres of pasture, and his annual net income exceeded 6,000 yuan.

    Planting grass is equivalent to planting grain. The development of pasture planting has helped many households escape the predicament of humans and livestock competing for grain. Nutrient-rich pastures can replace part of the grain, and poultry and livestock can absorb them easily and gain weight quickly.

    Last year, Guangxi's grain production decreased, but the end-of-year inventory of grass-eating poultry and livestock still reached 7.417 million head, providing 238,100 tons of beef and mutton to society. Livestock experts analyzed that planting pastures played a significant role.

    Planting grass does not occupy arable land; it can be planted alone or interplanted, effectively resolving the conflict between forestry and animal husbandry.

    The forestry department in Baise Region encourages farmers to plant grass, and the development of grass-eating poultry and livestock has been rapid. In the 12 counties of the entire region, farmers are supported in planting grass between trees and fruits, adding 15,000 acres of new pasture area. This not only increases farmers' income but also improves land utilization. Additionally, wherever pastures are planted, soil erosion has been reduced to varying degrees.

    以草换粮　以草换肉
    广西农村大种“希望之草”
    全区人工牧草场达到20余万亩
    本报南宁11月1日电　记者蒋耀强报道：“以草换粮、以草换肉”，在广西农民看来已不再是空想。随着人工种草业的发展，全区目前已拥有人工牧草场20余万亩。不少山区农民从发展“希望之草”中，找到了解决人畜争粮矛盾、加快脱贫步伐的途径。
    广西地处亚热带，丘陵山地占全区土地总面积的近3／4，且气候温和，山多草茂，是南方的天然牧区。有关部门调查后发现，牧草丰富的桂西北山区农民，之所以迟迟未能迈出脱贫致富的步伐，很重要的一个原因就是不能根据当地实际发展草食禽畜。
    区党委、区政府根据这一情况，及时健全草业开发机构，成立了禽畜领导小组，并把种植牧草发展草食禽畜作为山区农民脱贫致富的重要门路。
    田林县福达乡农民梁新财，以往常为填饱肚子而发愁。1987年，他种植30亩牧草，年纯收入连年在6000元以上。
    种草等于种粮，发展种植牧草业，使不少农户走出了“人畜争粮”的窘境。营养丰富的牧草，可替代部分粮食，禽畜易吸收，长膘快。
    去年，广西粮食减产，草食禽畜年末存栏仍高达741.7万头，向社会提供牛羊肉23.81万吨。畜牧专家分析说，种植牧草立了一功。
    种草不占耕地，既可单独种，亦可套种，较好地解决了林牧矛盾。
    百色地区林业部门鼓励农民种草，草食禽畜发展相当快。全地区12个县，扶持农民林间、果间种草，新增牧草面积1.5万亩，既增加了农民收入，又提高了土地利用率，此外，凡是种植牧草的地方，水土流失亦有不同程度的减少。
