Who could believe that while beautiful private residential buildings are springing up all over Chongming Island, a veteran tax officer who has worked for 25 years and his family of four still live in a dilapidated shack?

His name is Zhang Shiliang, a Communist Party member and Deputy Director of the Caopeng Tax Office under the Chongming County Tax Bureau in Shanghai. As the anti-corruption and clean governance campaign gains momentum, Zhang Shiliang's story of living in a humble abode with clean hands and selfless dedication has spread across the island.

Nearly fifty years old, Zhang Shiliang was poor from a young age. Five years ago, when he was transferred to the Caopeng Town Tax Office, his family left their long-neglected thatched cottage and moved to a newly reclaimed sandbank in Lvhuaxiang. Seeing that he had no roof over his head, local people lent him three abandoned sheds. Zhang Shiliang and his family settled down there.

Zhang Shiliang's greatest wish is for his family to live in a new brick house built by himself. The relevant local departments cared for him and approved his application to build a house. Thus, starting from 1984, Zhang Shiliang gradually bought some timber with money and receipts. However, on Chongming Island, the most difficult part of building a house is obtaining bricks. Without any connections, Zhang Shiliang waited for five years, but the 70,000 bricks were still not in his hands.

People around him saw that Zhang Shiliang wore a tax officer's uniform and was a "high-ranking" official in charge of tax collection in four townships. They couldn't believe he couldn't get bricks. Many people told him, "Old Zhang, there are so many people who need your help here. If you ask someone to do something, what can't you accomplish?" Even his wife, who had suffered with him for so long, couldn't help but advise him, "For the sake of the two children, you should ask someone for help."

However, Zhang Shiliang had his own thoughts: if you eat someone's food, you will be soft-spoken; if you take someone's money, you will be short of hands. What can I use to repay the favor? After all, what people value in me is the little power of being a tax officer. Using the state's tax collection for exchange, I, Zhang Shiliang, can't do it! Once, a local brick kiln sent several transportation households to Zhang Shiliang's door, hoping he would approve the exemption of the kiln's transportation business tax. At that time, if he agreed, the 70,000 bricks might have been delivered to his doorstep soon. But Zhang Shiliang replied without hesitation, "This tax is a state regulation, and I have no right to violate it."

Zhang Shiliang's family lives in poverty, with no decent furniture or appliances, and their savings have been spent on buying bricks and tiles. His wife is sick, his daughter is in school, and his 80-year-old mother needs care. He lacks money and needs money, but in the face of money's temptation, Zhang Shiliang always insists on his view of money: earn it through labor, do not take unjust wealth. Over the years, when he worked in villages, he often paid for his meals in restaurants. According to regulations, he could enjoy meal subsidies, but he never claimed them once. He said, "Eating a meal is just a few yuan, and at home, I also eat this much. Besides, I am a cadre in the office, so I should make do." However, for public funds, Zhang Shiliang was meticulous, never taking a penny's advantage.

The shed is simple, but Zhang Shiliang lives in it with a peaceful mind. He does not harm the public or himself, serving the people wholeheartedly. The oath he took when he joined the Communist Party 18 years ago has always been his motto.

    陋室见精神
    ——记崇明县草棚税务所副所长张士良
    刘士安　李富昌　沈涌泉
    谁能相信，眼下崇明岛上漂亮的私人住宅楼一幢幢拔地而起时，一个工作了25年的“老税务”，一家4口仍借住在3间破旧的屋棚里。
    他叫张士良，共产党员，上海市崇明县税务局草棚税务所副所长。随着反腐倡廉之风盛起，张士良身居陋室两袖清风、克己奉公的事迹，也在海岛上传开。
    年近半百的张士良自幼家贫。5年前他调到草棚镇税务所时，举家离开年久失修的草房，搬到附近新围垦出的沙滩绿华乡。当地人看他片瓦全无，借了三间废弃不用的屋棚给他，张士良一家就此安下身来。
    张士良最大的心愿莫过于一家老小都住进自家盖起的新瓦房。当地有关部门对他很是关心，批准了他的建房申请。于是，张士良从1984年起，陆续花钱开票买了一些木料。可是在崇明岛上，造房子最难的要数弄到砖，没门没路的，张士良等了5年，7万块砖仍然没有拿到手。
    周围的人见张士良身穿税务制服，又是管着当地4个乡税收的“长”字号干部，怎么也不相信他弄不到砖。不少人对他说：“老张呀，此地有求于你的人真是太多了，你要找人办事，哪还有办不成的？”连跟他一起苦惯了的妻子也忍不住劝他：“看在两个孩子份上，你就向人张个口吧。”
    但是，张士良自有他的想法：吃人的嘴软，拿人的手短。我欠了人情用啥还？其实人家看中我的，还不是做税务干部的一点权力。拿国家的税收做交易，我张士良做不来！有一次，当地一家窑厂让几个拉砖瓦的运输户找上张士良家门来，想请他批准免掉窑厂的运输营业税。当时只要他同意，7万块砖也许很快就送上门了，可张士良不假思索地说，“这税是国家规定收的，我没权违反。”
    张士良一家生活清寒，没有什么像样的家具电器，积蓄也花在买砖瓦上了。妻子有病、女儿上学，还有80多岁的老母亲需要照顾。他缺钱，需要钱，然而在钱的诱惑面前，张士良始终坚持自己的金钱观：靠劳动所得，不取不义之财。多年来，他走村串户工作时，常在饮食店里掏钱吃饭，按规定可以享受伙食补贴，可他从来没有报销过一次。他说，“我吃顿饭也就是块把钱，在家里也要吃这么多的，再说我是所里的干部，还是凑合些吧。”可是对公家的钱，张士良却丁是丁、卯是卯，从不占一分钱的便宜。
    屋棚虽然简陋，但张士良住着心安。不损公、不利己，全心全意为人民服务。18年前加入共产党时的宣誓，一直是他的座右铭。
