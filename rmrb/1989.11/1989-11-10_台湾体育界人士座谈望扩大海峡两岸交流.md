Taiwanese sports figures recently held a discussion, hoping to expand exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.

The Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee recently invited representatives from ten sports teams that had previously competed on the mainland to hold a discussion. Most of the attendees believed that the benefits of competing on the mainland outweigh the drawbacks and expressed the hope of expanding exchanges.

Taiwanese sports figures believe that competing on the mainland can enhance mutual understanding. Without language barriers, coaches and athletes from both sides can engage in technical exchanges and discussions. Taiwanese athletes, to varying degrees, benefit from this. Additionally, the Asian Games will be held in Beijing next year, and Taiwanese teams can adapt to the venue and climate in advance, which is beneficial for achieving good results.

Representatives from various teams that competed on the mainland believe that cross-strait sports exchanges have been successful. They hope that the Taiwanese authorities will consider allowing sports organizations to conduct off-site training on the mainland or to organize training camps and invite mainland coaches to share their experiences in Taiwan. Some representatives also suggested expanding sports exchanges with the mainland to include invitation tournaments, rather than being limited to current formal championships.

Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee Secretary-General Li Qinghua, while presiding over the discussion, stated that cross-strait sports exchanges are a significant event for the Taiwanese sports community and that "the direction of exchanges will not change in the future."

    台湾体育界人士座谈望扩大海峡两岸交流
    本报香港11月9日电　中国台北奥委会日前邀集十支曾经前往大陆参赛的体育队伍代表座谈。与会者大多数认为赴大陆参赛利大于弊，并望扩大交流。
    台湾体育界人士认为，赴大陆比赛可增进了解，在无语言障碍的沟通下，两岸教练和选手进行技术交流切磋，台湾选手或多或少享受其利。此外，明年亚运会在北京举行，台湾队伍能对场地、气候先行作些适应，有利于争取佳绩。
    赴大陆参赛的各队代表认为两岸体育交流是成功的。他们希望台湾当局考虑允许体育团体在大陆作易地训练，或办讲习班请大陆教练赴台传授经验。部分代表还建议与大陆的体育交流扩大为邀请赛，而不仅限于目前的正式锦标赛。
    中国台北奥委会秘书长李庆华在主持该项座谈时称，两岸体育交流对台湾体育界是一件大事，今后“交流方向不会变”。
