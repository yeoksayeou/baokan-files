Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 20th — In the deepening of rural economic reforms, Jiaozuo City in Henan Province has creatively implemented a group-type dual contracting responsibility system. This has strengthened the state's macro-control functions, effectively regulated the interests of the state, collectives, and farmers, and mobilized the enthusiasm of rural cadres and the masses, pushing rural economic reforms to a new level.

The specific content of the group-type dual contracting responsibility system is as follows: vertically, from the city to the county to the township, down to the village and individual households, a contracting management mechanism is established at each level. Contracts are signed between each level, clearly defining service items from top to bottom and setting targets from bottom to top. Horizontally, various levels of government sign horizontal responsibility contracts with relevant functional departments, comprehensively using economic, administrative, and legal means to bring together departments that control funds, technology, and agricultural production materials. These departments form high-yield development groups, combining financial resources, manpower, intelligence, and authority to create a "joint force" that serves agricultural production in a coordinated manner. Contracts are fulfilled, and those who exceed their targets are rewarded, while those who do not are penalized.

Jiaozuo City began implementing this contracting method in the entire rural area starting from the wheat sowing season in 1988. This method maintains the stability of the household contract responsibility system while promoting the improvement of the dual management system of separation and combination, bringing about profound changes in the rural areas of the entire city. Firstly, it fundamentally eliminated the phenomenon of "land is contracted, but cadres do not manage it," promoting the reform of cadres' leadership methods, changes in work style, and improvements in work efficiency. Secondly, it achieved large-scale agricultural operations, enabling agriculture to obtain better economies of scale. Thirdly, it promoted the widespread use of scientific and technological advancements. Fourthly, it strengthened the macro-control of agricultural production and enhanced the contractual awareness of cadres and the masses.

The group-type dual contracting system has elevated agricultural production to a new level. This year, the city's total grain production reached 1.44 billion kilograms, an increase of 13.6% compared to last year, and 9.2% higher than the historical peak in 1984.

　　纵向逐级承包　横向联合负责
　　焦作推行集团型双向承包
    据新华社郑州11月20日电　（记者李海甫、姬世法）河南省焦作市在深化农村经济改革的探索中，创造性地实行集团双向承包责任制，强化了国家宏观调控职能，较好地理顺了国家、集体、农民之间的利益关系，调动了广大农村干部群众的积极性，把农村经济改革推上了新台阶。
    集团型双向承包责任制的具体内容是：纵的方面从市到县到乡，一直到村到农户，逐级建立起承包经营机制，层层签订双方责任承包书，自上而下明确服务项目，自下而上明确指标任务；横的方面是各级政府同有关的职能部门签订横向责任书，综合运用经济的、行政的、法律的手段，把掌握资金、技术和农用生产资料的有关部门联合起来，组成高产开发集团，使财力、物力、智力和权力相结合，形成“合力”，协调一致地向农业生产服务。履行合同，超额完成任务的奖励，否则受到处罚。
    焦作市从1988年麦播时开始，在全部农村实行这种承包办法，既保持了以家庭经营为主的联产承包责任制的稳定，又促进了统分结合的双层经营体制的完善，使全市农村发生了深刻变化：一是从根本上消除了“土地联了产，干部不咋管”的现象，促进了干部领导方法改革，作风转变，工作效率提高。二是实现了较大规模的农业经营，使农业得到较佳的规模经济效益。三是促进了科学技术的推广使用。四是加强对农业生产的宏观调控，增强了干部群众的契约意识。
    集团型双向承包制，使农业生产更上一层楼。今年全市粮食总产量达14.4亿公斤，比去年增长13.6％，比历史上最高的1984年增长9.2％。
