Early winter. Beijing, Guoyi Hotel.

When 67 members of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) and 48 attending representatives gathered from all corners of the country, their greatest impression was: since the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee, there have been new developments in party discipline and construction from the central to the local levels. According to statistics from 22 provinces and municipalities, since July of this year, 32,000 cases of party discipline violations have been investigated, with a conclusion rate of 68.4%. The cases involved 597 officials at the county or higher level, including 45 officials at the provincial or municipal level.

Several members who serve as leaders of provincial and municipal discipline inspection commissions told reporters that in recent months, through efforts to combat corruption, clean up and rectify companies, investigate the misuse of power for personal gain, curb extravagant spending, and prevent the illegal business activities of the children of leading officials, the construction of party discipline, which has been repeatedly disrupted and damaged over the years, has shown new improvements. The people have seen and remembered this. The image of the party and the authority of the central government have been restored and strengthened through these concrete actions of party discipline construction. Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently praised the work of the new central leadership collective with the words "remarkably effective," which is quite appropriate.

At the meeting, She Yong, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection, raised a thought-provoking issue. He said that the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred this spring and summer further confirmed that the issue of party discipline is indeed a matter of life and death for the party. If we do not focus on party discipline construction and allow corruption to spread, it will inevitably give way to bourgeois liberalization, and reform and opening up will deviate from the correct track. The party will lose the support of the people and the hearts of the people. The lessons of history must be deeply engraved in our hearts. To focus on party discipline, we must do practical things, say one thing and do one thing; do one thing and achieve one thing, truly gaining the trust of the people.

"Punishing corruption is an important aspect of strengthening the party, and investigating cases of party discipline violations is a key battle in punishing corruption." This is a point of experience from the Hubei Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection. In the previous period, various levels of discipline inspection commissions in Hubei, despite risks and pressures, investigated many cases. However, due to the influence of the overall situation, some cases were left unfinished, and sometimes they were even said to be "obstructing reform." After the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee, the Central Committee, led by Comrade Jiang Zemin, paid high attention to party building, seriously addressed issues of general concern to the people, and resolutely punished corruption, setting a good example for clean governance nationwide. As a result, investigating cases below has become more justified and confident.

How should party discipline construction be carried out? Where should we start? At this meeting, many provincial, municipal, and grassroots discipline inspection commissions shared their experiences. Among them, the experience of Jiangxi Province is: start with the "difficult" issues that the people care about the most and have the strongest reactions to. For example, the supply of agricultural materials in rural areas, and the problem of some party and government leaders building "comfortable nests" for themselves in urban areas. The "difficult" among "difficult" issues is probably the extravagant use of public funds for feasting. Jiangxi Province wastes hundreds of millions of yuan every year in banquets. Recently, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection have focused their efforts and made great strides to tackle these long-standing "chronic diseases," achieving satisfactory results: the entertainment expenses of various levels of party and government agencies have been reduced by more than 80%, and the "feasting wind" has been basically curbed.

The attending members and representatives all have a common feeling: the atmosphere of the whole party focusing on party discipline is forming, and now is the time to boost morale and promote the improvement of party discipline!

    党风建设大有起色
    ——中纪委五次全会侧记
    本报记者　陈维伟
    初冬。北京国谊宾馆。
    当67名中纪委委员和48名列席代表从祖国四面八方汇集在一起的时候，他们最大的感触是：党的四中全会开过以后的几个月来，从中央到地方，在党风党纪建设方面有了新的起色。据全国22个省市的统计，今年7月份以后共查处党内违纪案3.2万余件，总结案率为68.4％，案件涉及县团级以上干部597人，其中包括45名省地级干部。
    几位担任省、市纪委领导的委员对记者说，这一段，上上下下通过抓反贪污受贿、清理整顿公司、查处以权谋私、刹吃喝风、制止领导干部子女非法经商办企业等，使多年来不断受到干扰和破坏的党风建设有了新的起色。老百姓看在眼里，记在心上。党的形象、中央的威信，就在这一件件党风建设的实事中，重新得到恢复和增强。小平同志最近在评价新的党中央领导集体的工作成绩时，用了“卓有成效”四个字，是恰如其份的。
    黑龙江省纪委书记谢勇在会上谈了一个引人深思的问题。他说，今年春夏之交发生的动乱和反革命暴乱，更加证实了党风问题确实是关系党的生死存亡的大问题。如果不抓党风建设，任凭腐败现象发展蔓延，势必给资产阶级自由化让出阵地，改革开放就会偏离正确的轨道，党就会脱离群众，失去民心。历史的教训，必须铭心刻骨。抓党风，就要办实事，要说一件，办一件；办一件，成一件，真正取信于民。
    “惩治腐败是加强党的建设的一个重要方面，查处党内违纪案件是惩治腐败的攻坚战。”这是湖北省纪委的一点体会。前一段时间，湖北各级纪委冒着风险，顶住压力，查处了不少案件。但由于受大气候影响，有些案件半途而废，不了了之，有时还被说成是“阻碍改革”。党的十三届四中全会以后，以江泽民同志为首的党中央高度重视党的建设，认真解决群众普遍关心的事，坚决惩治腐败，给各地廉政建设带了好头，下面查处案件也更加理直气壮了。
    党风建设应当怎么抓？从何入手？这次会议上，许多省、市和基层纪委的同志介绍了经验。其中，江西省的经验是：从人民群众最为关心、反映最为强烈的“难点”问题抓起。比如说，农村的农资供应问题，城镇的少数党政领导干部为自己营建“安乐窝”的问题。“难点”中的“难点”，恐怕要数用公款大吃大喝了。江西省每年有上亿元人民币在觥筹交错中化为乌有。最近，江西省委、省纪委集中精力、下大力气，来对付这些久治不愈的“顽症”，取得令人满意的成效：各级党政机关的招待费普遍减少了80％以上，“吃喝风”基本被刹住。
    与会委员和代表都有一个共同的感觉：全党抓党风的大气候正在形成，现在该是振奋精神、促进党风尽快好转的时候了！
