"Poverty alleviation has real strategies, one big step each year" — this is the praise people have for the efforts of Puyang City in Henan Province over the past few years to address poverty in the Yellow River region.

Puyang City was established in 1983. The Yellow River flows through Puyang for 163 kilometers, with over 700,000 people living along the river, suffering from floods, waterlogging, drought, and sandstorms. In the more than 30 years since the founding of the People's Republic, the state has provided 1.9 billion yuan in relief funds and 600 million kilograms of relief grain to this region, with limited effect.

In 1986, a new leadership team for the municipal Party committee and government was established. The main leaders conducted in-depth investigations and research in the poverty-stricken areas along the Yellow River and decided to make poverty alleviation and prosperity a strategic focus for revitalizing the economy. The city established a leading group for the economic development of poverty-stricken areas, and counties, towns, and townships in poverty-stricken areas also established corresponding command and work systems, gradually forming a set of effective "three-in-one" governance measures:

First, combining a certain amount of investment with mobilizing the masses to rely on self-reliance. They focused on the key issue of "controlling water and promoting agriculture," investing 32 million yuan over four years. At the same time, they mobilized the masses to work hard and undertake projects such as diverting the Yellow River for irrigation, treating low-lying areas, and transforming riverbeds, increasing arable land by hundreds of thousands of acres, and achieving a grain yield of 650 kilograms per acre. Over the past four years, each rural labor force has averaged 15 cubic meters of earth excavation per year, with the masses voluntarily contributing labor worth 30 million yuan.

Second, combining scientific and technological poverty alleviation with policy preferences. Puyang City has 347 administrative villages along the Yellow River, with only 14 technical personnel in the past. The municipal Party committee and government, on the one hand, invited experts from outside to help formulate poverty alleviation plans, and on the other hand, trained local farmer technicians and established an agricultural technology service system. Some poverty-stricken areas have established farmer technical schools, science and technology training centers, and science and technology poverty alleviation points. Dozens of townships have set up animal husbandry and veterinary centers and are in the process of establishing comprehensive agricultural technology service stations. The city has formulated a series of policies to encourage technical personnel to go to the countryside for poverty alleviation, and also provides preferences and rewards for rural elites who lead poverty-stricken households to start businesses and achieve prosperity.

Third, combining economic poverty alleviation with strengthening cultural education. In the past, here the school buildings were in poor condition, with "less than a thousand bricks, roofs exposed to the sky, doors without door panels, windows bricked up," with 44% of the buildings being dangerous, 70% of the students without desks and chairs, and 20% of school-age children unable to attend primary school, with 12-year-olds and older accounting for half of the illiterate and semi-illiterate population. In recent years, the municipal and county governments have invested 92.7 million yuan in education, and raised an additional 1.4 billion yuan, building and renovating 7.6 million square meters of classrooms, reducing the proportion of dangerous buildings in primary and secondary schools to 2.2% last year. The entire city has also established 18 vocational schools and 48 adult education schools, changing the structure of secondary education.

The "three-in-one" approach has significantly accelerated the pace of poverty alleviation in Puyang along the Yellow River. From 1986 to 1988, Puyang's grain production increased year by year. In 1988, the 21 poverty-stricken townships along the Yellow River produced a total of 195 million kilograms of grain, nearly doubling the average grain production of 1 billion kilograms in the four years before 1985, with a per capita grain ration of 285 kilograms; per capita net income reached 240 yuan, increasing by more than 2.5 times. The basic problem of food and clothing can be solved in the next two years.

    粮食总产翻番  人均收入倍增
    濮阳沿黄区加快脱贫
    主要措施：发动群众依靠科技重视教育
    本报讯　记者高新庆报道：“脱贫有实招，一年一大步”——这是人们对河南濮阳市几年来治理沿黄（河）贫困地区的赞誉。
    濮阳市是1983年新建市。黄河流经濮阳163公里，全市70多万人口沿黄居住，饱受洪、涝、旱、沙之苦。建国后30多年里，国家向这个地区发放救济款1.9亿元，救济粮6亿公斤，效果不大。
    1986年，濮阳新一届市委、市府班子成立后，主要领导就深入沿黄贫困地区调查研究，下决心把脱贫致富作为振兴经济的战略重点。市里成立贫困地区经济开发领导小组，贫困地区县、乡、镇也都成立了相应的指挥和工作系统，逐步形成一整套有效的“三结合”的治理措施：
    一是把一定的投入与发动群众自力更生结合起来。他们紧紧抓住“治水兴农”这个关键问题，四年共投入资金3200万元。同时，发动群众艰苦创业，先后进行了引黄抗旱、治理洼地、改造滩地等工程，增加良田几十万亩，粮食亩产达到650公斤。四年来，每个农村劳力平均每年挖土15立方米，群众义务献工折款达3000万元。
    二是把科技扶贫与政策优惠结合起来。濮阳市沿黄347个行政村，过去只有14名科技人员。市委、市政府一面从外地请专家帮助制订脱贫计划，一面培养本地农民技术员，建立农业技术服务体系。一些贫困地区建立了农民技术学校、科技培训中心和科技扶贫点，几十个乡建起畜牧畜医中心，并正在组建农业技术综合服务站。市里制订了一系列政策，鼓励科技人员下乡扶贫，对农村能人带领贫困户创办经济实体脱贫致富的，也给予优惠和奖励。
    三是把经济上脱贫与加强文化教育结合起来。过去，这里的校舍“有砖不过千，有顶露着天，有门无门扇，有窗垒着砖”，危房面积达44％，70％的学生无课桌板凳，还有20％的适龄儿童不能上小学，12岁以上的文盲半文盲占总人口的一半。几年来，市县两级财政投资教育927万元，另外集资1.4亿元，新建改建教室76万平方米，中小学危房比例下降至去年的2.2％。全市还建起18所中等职业技校、48所成人教育学校，改变了中等教育结构。
    “三结合”的做法大大加快濮阳沿黄脱贫步伐。1986年至1988年，濮阳粮食生产一年上一个台阶。21个沿黄贫困乡镇，1988年粮食总产1.95亿公斤，比1985年前四年平均产粮1亿公斤接近翻一番，人均口粮285公斤；人均纯收入达240元，增长2.5倍多。今明两年，温饱问题可以基本解决。
