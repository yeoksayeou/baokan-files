Currently, the global total number of cars has exceeded 500 million, with an average of one car for every ten people. The majority of these cars are concentrated in Western developed countries, accounting for about 70% to 80% of the total. The United States has 170 million cars, meaning almost every adult has one, and each household has one to two cars. Paris alone has 3 million private cars. The city of Lisbon is not very large, but within the city limits, there are 100,000 cars, averaging 250 cars per square kilometer, making it the city with the highest car density in Europe.

Due to the increasing number of small cars on the streets, city traffic has become congested, and average speeds have decreased. In large cities like New York, London, and Tokyo, the average speed of small cars is only about 13 kilometers per hour; in Lisbon, it is only 8 kilometers per hour, and in some areas, it is even lower, at just 3 kilometers per hour, which is slower than both cycling and walking.

With more cars comes more traffic congestion and an increase in accidents. In France, about 10,000 people die in traffic accidents each year, 6,000 in West Germany, and 5,000 in Britain. The traffic accident rate in Seoul, South Korea, is even higher, earning it the title of "City of Traffic Accidents." Globally, approximately 500,000 people die in traffic accidents each year, and 10 million are injured, resulting in direct economic losses of $400-500 million.

In cities, an excessive number of small cars also damages the human living environment. The exhaust fumes from small cars are a significant source of air pollution in cities and a major public health hazard.

It seems that addressing the public hazards caused by small cars will be a major social issue that humanity will need to tackle in the next century.

    西方大城市车满为患
    目前，世界汽车总拥有量已超过五亿辆，平均每十人一辆。世界上的汽车主要集中在西方发达国家，约占百分之七十至八十。美国的汽车拥有量达一点七亿辆，按成年人计算，几乎每人一辆，每个家庭一至二辆。巴黎仅私人汽车就有三百万辆。里斯本城市不太大，但城区就有十万辆车，每平方公里合二百五十辆，被称为欧洲汽车密度最高的城市。
    由于越来越多的小汽车涌上街头，造成城市交通拥挤，时速降低。如纽约、伦敦、东京这样的大城市，小汽车的平均时速不过十三公里；里斯本只有八公里，在个别地段更低，只有三公里，不仅比骑自行车，而且比步行还慢。
    汽车多，交通拥挤，车祸增多。法国一年内死于交通事故的有一万人，联邦德国有六千人，英国有五千人。南朝鲜汉城交通事故率更高，被称为“交通事故之城”。全球每年死于交通事故约有五十万人，伤一千万人，直接经济损失四五亿美元。
    城市里过多的小汽车还破坏了人类的生存环境。小汽车排出的废气，是城市空气污染的祸源之一，是影响人们健康的一大公害。
    看来，解决小汽车公害问题，将是下个世纪人类要解决的一大社会问题。　　　　（余洋）
