The world's first inter-subspecies hybrid rice combination, "Jing-Jian You 2," has shown remarkable yield increases in large-scale trials in Jiangsu this year. It outperforms the widely cultivated hybrid rice "Shan You 63" by about 15%, with small-scale high-yield plots achieving yields of up to 750 kilograms per mu.

"Jing-Jian You 2" was developed through years of research by the Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences in collaboration with agricultural technology departments in Lianyungang City, Gan Yu County, and Yi Xing City. The hybrid combines "02428," one of China's most widely used rice varieties, with "Zhong Xian 3037."

This represents a significant breakthrough in China's super high-yield rice breeding.

The project leader, Professor Zhou Jiangshi, director of the Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences' Grain Crop Research Institute, reported that after more than two years of small-scale trials, "Jing-Jian You 2" has shown superior characteristics. Its growth period and fertilizer requirements are similar to those of hybrid rice, but it has an effective tillering rate of over 80%, more than 200 grains per panicle, a seed setting rate of over 75%, and good resistance to white leaf blight and lodging. Its milling rate is 70%, and the rice quality is excellent. These features surpass those of current hybrid rice varieties. Additionally, it is easy to produce seeds, with seed plots yielding around 125 kilograms per mu, making it convenient for promotion.

This year, Jiangsu Province planted over 1,000 mu of "Jing-Jian You 2." In Gan Yu County, a 100-mu high-yield plot averaged 620 kilograms per mu, a 10% increase over the locally cultivated "Shan You 63." The highest-yielding 0.07-mu plot produced 759.5 kilograms per mu. In Jiangning County's Mo Ling Township, over 80 mu of low-yield plots yielded 580 kilograms per mu, a 15% increase over other hybrid rice varieties. Farmers praised this rice, saying, "It's easy to raise seedlings, the seedlings are strong, it requires less fertilizer, is resistant to diseases, and is easy to cultivate, saving labor, fertilizer, and pesticides."

    我水稻超高产育种取得突破
    亚种间杂交稻小面积亩产达750公斤
    据新华社南京11月18日电 （记者赵明、通讯员费广震）世界上第一个应用于生产的亚种间杂交稻优势组合——“籼粳亚优2号”，今年在江苏大面积试种获得令人惊异的增产效果。它比目前广为种植的杂交稻“汕优63”增产15％左右，小面积高产田块亩产可达750公斤左右。
      “籼粳亚优2号”是江苏省农科院经过多年研究，并与连云港市、赣榆县、宜兴市农业技术部门合作，将中国最好利用的水稻广亲和材料之一“02428”和“中籼3037”杂交培育成功的。这是我国水稻超高产育种的一个重大突破。
    课题负责人、江苏省农科院粮食作物研究所所长邹江石研究员介绍说，经过两年多小面积试种证明，“籼粳亚优2号”长相好，优势强，生育期和肥水条件跟杂交稻相仿，但有效分蘖率在80％以上，每穗总颖花数在200个以上，结实率在75％以上，对白叶枯病有较好的抗性，也抗倒伏，出米率达到70％，米质属优质粳米。这些特点都超过目前的杂交稻。而且它制种简便实用，制种田产量一般在125公斤左右，易于推广。
    今年江苏省试种了1000多亩。赣榆县100多亩丰产片平均亩产620公斤，比当地种植的“汕优63”增长1成以上，其中1.05亩高产田，亩产达到759.5公斤。江宁县秣棱乡在80多亩中低产田里试种，亩产也达到580公斤，比其它杂交稻增产15％。农民称赞这种水稻“秧好育，苗好栽，用肥不多，抗性强，种起来省工、省肥、省药”。
