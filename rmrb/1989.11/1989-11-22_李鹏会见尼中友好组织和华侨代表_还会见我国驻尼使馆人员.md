Sakya told Li Peng that he graduated from Tsinghua University with a major in electrical engineering. Li Peng said, "We are colleagues."

Sakya also said that he lived in China for five or six years and deeply understood the friendly feelings of the Chinese people towards the Nepalese people. To spread friendship, they established the Aniko Alumni Association. Li Peng was very pleased to hear this. He wrote the name of the Aniko Alumni Association and took a group photo with the representatives.
