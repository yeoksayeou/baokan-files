		On November 8, the Shougang Factory Committee announced to all employees that due to the company's failure to meet the monthly plan for October, which was set to increase annual profits by 20%, the company would not issue bonuses for that month. The shortfall in profits amounted to 42.01 million yuan.

		This is the second time in 130 months of reform that Shougang has failed to meet its monthly plan. From January to September this year, the company overcame various difficulties and achieved a profit growth of 18.6% compared to the same period last year. However, a major accident at the No. 3 blast furnace in October affected the overall performance.

		The Factory Committee Chairman Zhou Guanwu, General Manager Zhao Changbai, and the manager of the North Plant, Xu Yongqi, made self-criticisms to the employees. Some workers shed tears over the failure to meet the plan. Many units' employees not only had no objections to the deduction of the current month's bonus but also signed a letter to the Factory Committee, expressing their willingness to use their own money to make up for the shortfall in profits.

		Currently, the broad masses of workers at Shougang are in high spirits. They are determined to make up for the losses in the remaining days of this year and complete the annual contractual plan.

    连月完成计划仅10月未达指标
    首钢严格承包规定不发当月奖金
    职工发扬主人翁精神决心夺取全年胜利
    本报讯　记者艾丰报道：11月8日，首都钢铁公司工厂委员会向全体工作者宣布了这样一项决定：由于全公司10月没有完成按全年利润递增20％安排的月度计划，差利润4201万元，根据承包制度规定，这个月全公司不发奖金。
    这是首钢实行改革130个月以来，第二次没有完成月计划。今年1至9月份，这个公司克服了各种困难，创造了实现利润比去年同期增长18.6％的好水平。但10月份3号高炉发生重大事故，影响了全局。
    工厂委员会主任周冠五、总经理赵长白、发生事故的北钢经理徐永起向职工作了检查。一些职工为没完成计划掉了眼泪。许多单位职工不仅对扣发当月奖金没意见，还签名上书工厂委员会，表示要用自己的钱补上欠缺的利润。
    现在首钢广大工作者情绪高昂，他们表示一定要抓紧今年的最后几十天时间，把损失夺回来，完成今年的承包计划。
