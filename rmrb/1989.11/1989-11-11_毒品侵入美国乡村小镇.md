The Christian Science Monitor reported today that drug trafficking gangs from major U.S. cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Washington are now extending their operations into rural areas and small towns across America.

The report revealed that these drug gangs have expanded their activities to remote towns and rural areas in states such as Georgia, Kansas, Iowa, Indiana, and California.

The report states that drug dealers are committing all manner of crimes, opposing the police, threatening local residents, openly conducting drug transactions, and randomly stopping cars on the highways to force drivers to purchase drugs.

Despite local police taking a series of measures to crack down on drug trafficking, they admit that the situation is "out of control" when facing these pervasive drug gangs. Local government agencies are also "at a loss."

The report says that these remote small towns have become targets for drug gangs because of the large influx of illegal drugs into the United States in recent times, and drug dealers are eager to expand their markets.

    毒品侵入美国乡村小镇
    新华社华盛顿11月8日电　美国《基督教科学箴言报》今天报道，美国纽约、洛杉矶和华盛顿等大城市的贩毒团伙目前正将他们的触角伸向美国的乡村和小城镇。
    该报揭露说，这些毒品团伙已将他们的活动范围扩展到乔治亚、堪萨斯、艾奥瓦、印第安纳和加利福尼亚等州的偏僻城镇和农村。
    报道说，毒品贩子无恶不作，他们同警察作对，威胁当地居民，公开经营毒品买卖，并在公路上随意拦截汽车，胁迫司机购买毒品。
    尽管当地警察采取了一系列措施来打击毒品买卖，但是面对这些无孔不入的贩毒团伙，警察部门也承认“目前局面已失去控制”，当地政府部门也“束手无策”。
    该报说，这些偏僻小镇之所以会成为毒品团伙的目标，是因为近一段时期来大量毒品非法运入美国境内，毒品贩子急于扩大他们`场。
