	Extracting Gold from Rocks

	The research team of Canada's Great Bay Resources Mining Company once claimed that they used bioleaching technology to mine gold from sulfide rocks. This technology utilizes the bacteria "Thiobacillus ferrooxidans" to process sulfide rocks or pyrite containing gold. This microorganism uses sulfur as an energy source, decomposes the structure of these rocks, and then extracts gold using ordinary methods.

	The company's scientists discovered in experiments that they could almost obtain 100% of the gold by processing 10 tons of ore daily with this technology over a few months. If traditional methods were used, such as using chemicals like sodium cyanide that can dissolve gold, the extraction rate would typically be less than 70%. Therefore, the company built the first facility in 1988 at the Giant Bay mine in Canada to accelerate gold extraction.

	At the same time, scientists discovered that Thiobacillus ferrooxidans works at around 30 degrees Celsius. However, during the oxidation reaction of these sulfide rocks, a large amount of heat is released. Thus, the factory built in Giant Bay, Canada, incurs very high costs for cooling the ore. For this reason, scientists are looking for bacteria that can work at higher temperatures. This means that large reactors will no longer be needed. Once this research achieves a breakthrough, a new system for gold mining will emerge, making it more economically attractive.

	No matter which technology system is adopted, it is undeniable that an efficient extraction method is needed to be welcomed by gold mining companies. It is said that currently, mining precious gold has become increasingly difficult, and a large amount of ore must be excavated to obtain 1 ounce (31.218 grams) of gold. According to statistics from the U.S. government, in 1974, U.S. mines produced 1.1 million ounces of gold, and by 1986, U.S. mines produced twice that amount of gold. However, it cost a considerable amount, in 1974, 7 tons of ore could produce 1 ounce of gold, while by 1986, 20 tons of ore were needed to obtain the same amount of gold. It is estimated that more than 30% of the world's gold reserves are in sulfide rocks, and bioleaching methods will be widely promoted.

	Detecting Gold Ore Reserves

	In recent years, scientists have discovered a type of bacterium, Bacillus, that lives in gold mines and has a preference for gold. Initially, a U.S. geological survey team first identified a waxy Bacillus with gold mines but did not know that this Bacillus had a preference for gold. Recently, the Vancouver Gene Exploration Limited Company in Canada developed a soil testing technology to detect bacterial spores growing in gold mines. This bacterium has a sensitive sense of smell and can detect the scent of gold. Scientists believe that gold molecule-based or symbiotic compounds may have created a good living environment for the natural predators of microorganisms.

	Therefore, Vancouver Gene Exploration Limited Company has developed a gold-detecting microbial probe that can detect bacterial spores, thereby indirectly detecting gold. Now, the company uses this probe to indicate the potential reserves of gold mines. There are reports that the biggest advantage of this technology is that geologists in remote areas do not need to bring ore to the laboratory on site for analysis; the results can be detected on-site within two hours.

	However, the current technology cannot accurately indicate the gold content of the ore. Researchers are further improving and perfecting the probe. Last year, Canada spent $800 million on gold mine exploration, so major mining companies have shown great interest in this probe, and it is expected that there will be large-scale market transactions.

	Using Microorganisms to Recover Metals

	Scientists are applying bacterial mining technology to a broader field. In addition to bacterial leaching of copper and gold, they have also conducted research and development on bacterial leaching of zinc and manganese, expanding the types of ores that can be leached. At the same time, microorganisms are used to recover metals from industrial waste, industrial wastewater, and remove impurities from concentrates.

	In this regard, research in the United States and other countries has already shown some results. For example, recently, scientists from the U.S. National Bureau of Standards identified some new special microorganisms that can better complete the task of "processing" minerals compared to the microorganisms currently in use. They also explored environmental factors that limit the rate of microbial processing of minerals, such as the effects of light, oxygen, humidity, and temperature on microorganisms.

	The Bureau also cooperated with relevant research institutions to carry out multiple studies on microbial processing processes, such as their joint search with the Iron and Steel Research Institute for the type of microorganisms that can recover copper from recycled copper chips. They also searched for microorganisms that can extract insoluble phosphorus from iron ore produced in the United States, making the iron ore more suitable for manufacturing special steel after phosphorus removal. The Bureau also worked with the National Electric Power Research Institute and other units to find new strains of microorganisms that can remove sulfur from coal (the specific method is to use dyes to color the microorganisms being tested and then use fluorescence microscopy to detect their activity), and collaborated with naval and air force research personnel to explore the recovery of strategic metals such as cobalt and chromium from smelting plant waste using microorganisms, and to study the use of bacteria to obtain gallium from low-grade ores.

	It is not difficult to foresee that the prospects for research on recovering metals using microorganisms will be attractive.

    再谈细菌采矿
    卢继传
    从岩石中提取黄金
    加拿大的大湾资源矿业公司的一个研究组曾声称，他们用生物浸出技术开采含硫岩中的黄金。这种技术利用细菌“氧化铁硫杆菌”来处理含有黄金的含硫岩石或黄铁矿。这种微生物用硫作能源，分解这种岩石的结构，然后用普通方法提取黄金。
    该公司的科学家在试验中发现，他们在几个月中每天用这种技术处理10吨矿石时，几乎能得到100％的黄金。如果使用传统的方法，即使用像氰化钠之类的能溶化黄金的化学药品，通常的提取量也不到70％。因此，该公司1988年在加拿大巨人湾的矿山上建造了第一座装置，加速提取黄金。
    同时，科学家发现，氧化铁硫杆菌在摄氏30度左右起作用。然而，在这种含硫岩石起氧化反应期间，将释放出非常大的热量。这样，在加拿大巨人湾建造的这座工厂，在冷却矿石方面要付出很昂贵的费用。为此，科学家们正在寻找能在较高温度下工作的细菌。这意味着不再需要大型反应器。一旦这项研究工作获得突破，将出现开采黄金的新系统，在其经济上更具有吸引力。
    无论哪种技术系统要受到黄金开采公司的欢迎，毫无疑问地都需要有一个高效的提取法。据称，当前开采贵重黄金已变得越来越困难，必须发掘大量的矿石才能获得1盎司（31.218克）黄金。根据美国政府的统计，1974年美国矿山生产了110万盎司黄金，到1986年美国矿山生产出这个数字2倍的黄金。但是，花费了相当大的代价，1974年，7吨矿石可生产1盎司黄金，而到1986年需要20吨矿石才能得到同样数量的黄金。人们预计，世界上有30％以上的黄金储藏在含硫岩石中，生物浸出法将普遍得到推广。
        探测金矿的储量
    近年来，科学家们发现一种细菌芽孢生存于金矿中，有嗜金的特点。早先是美国一支地质考察队首先确定了一种蜡状芽孢杆菌与金矿共生，但不了解这种杆菌具有嗜金能力。不久前，加拿大温哥华基因探索有限公司发展了一种土壤试验技术，检测生长在金矿中的细菌芽孢，这种细菌有灵敏的嗅觉，能嗅出黄金的气味。科学家认为，以黄金分子为主体的或联生的复合物可能替微生物的天然猎食者制造了一个良好的生存环境。
    于是，加拿大温哥华基因探索有限公司便制造一种探测黄金微生物探针，利用它能探测到细菌芽孢，从而间接地探测到黄金。现在，该公司利用这个探针来标示金矿的潜在储量。有报道说，这种技术的最大的好处是，地质学家在边远地区无需把矿石带到驻地实验室分析，就地两个小时即可检测出结果。
    但是，现有技术还不能准确地标示金矿的含金品位，研究人员正在对探针进一步完善、改进。去年加拿大用于寻找金矿的耗资达8亿美元，因此，各大矿业公司已对这种探针深感兴趣，预计将有大宗市场交易。
        用微生物回收金属
    科学家正把细菌采矿技术应用于更大的领域。他们用于细菌浸铜、浸金之外，还进行了细菌浸锌、细菌浸锰等开发与研究，扩大浸出矿石品种。同时，用微生物从工业废料、工业废水中回收金属，从精矿中除去杂物等。
    这方面的研究，美国等国家已初见成效。如不久前，美国国家标准局科学家鉴别出一些新的特殊微生物，它们与现在所使用的微生物相比，能够更好完成“处理”矿物的任务。他们还探索限制微生物处理矿物速率的环境因素，如光线、氧、湿度、温度对微生物发生什么影响。
    该局还与有关科研单位合作，开展多项微生物处理过程的研究，如他们与钢铁研究机构联合寻找什么类型的微生物能够从被重新冶炼的废铜屑中回收铜。他们还寻找能从美国本国新产的铁矿中提取不溶性磷的生物，以使铁矿除磷后更适于制造特种钢。该局还与全国电力研究院等单位一起，寻找能除去煤中硫的微生物新品种（具体办法是，用着色剂给被试验的微生物上色，再用显微荧光图像法检测其活性），并同海、空军科研人员合作，探索用微生物从冶炼厂废料中收回战略金属钴、铬等，并研究使用细菌从低品位矿中得到镓。
    不难预计，用微生物回收金属研究的前景将是诱人的。
