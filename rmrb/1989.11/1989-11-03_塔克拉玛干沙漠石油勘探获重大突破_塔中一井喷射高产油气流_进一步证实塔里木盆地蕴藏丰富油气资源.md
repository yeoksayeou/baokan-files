The China National Petroleum Corporation announced on November 2 that on October 31, the Tarim Oil Exploration and Development Command reported good news: the first exploratory well in the Tazhong structure (Tazhong 1) in the heart of the Taklamakan Desert in the Tarim Basin achieved a high-yield oil and gas flow during an intermediate test, producing 576 cubic meters of oil and 360,000 cubic meters of natural gas per day. The oil is light and of good quality. This is another major breakthrough in exploration work following the northern regions of Welnan and Yingmaili in the Tarim Basin, further confirming that the basin is rich in oil and gas resources.

The Tazhong structure in the Tarim Basin is the largest giant structure in the country. According to the latest seismic data, the closed area of the structure is 8,200 square kilometers, and the maximum amplitude from the top to the bottom of the structure is 1,750 meters, with rich oil sources and migration and accumulation conditions.

The major breakthrough achieved by Tazhong 1 is a victory of the policy of "independence and self-reliance" and the result of the long-term hard work of petroleum workers. Since 1983, relying mainly on their own strength, they have introduced and mastered modern desert digital seismic technology from abroad, conducted seismic exploration across the Taklamakan Desert, and completed 19 large digital seismic sections. Combined with some deep well data from other regions of the basin, they have initially clarified the regional geological situation of the Tarim Basin and discovered several large and giant structures in the basin. Subsequently, further seismic work was carried out in favorable areas, basically clarifying the distribution, shape, scale, and stratigraphic composition of some structures. This provides a geological basis for the drilling of Tazhong 1.

Currently, the 7015 drilling team of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration Bureau is continuing to drill deeper in collaboration with other units. The conditions here are extremely harsh, with surface temperatures reaching 70°C in the summer, water shortages, sandstorms, and transportation mainly relying on air transport. The corporation recently sent a telegram to express its concern for the petroleum workers there.

The oil exploration in the Taklamakan Desert has made a major breakthrough. The picture shows the Tazhong 1 well in the desert, which has achieved a high-yield oil and gas flow, further confirming that the Tarim Basin is rich in oil and gas resources.

    塔克拉玛干沙漠石油勘探获重大突破
    塔中一井喷射高产油气流
    进一步证实塔里木盆地蕴藏丰富油气资源
    本报讯　记者高新庆报道：中国石油天然气总公司11月2日在新闻发布会上宣布：10月31日，塔里木石油勘探开发指挥部传来喜讯：位于塔里木盆地塔克拉玛干大沙漠腹地的塔中构造第一口探井（塔中一井），在中途测试中，获得日产石油576立方米、天然气36万立方米的高产油气流，油质轻，质量好。这是勘探工作继塔里木盆地北部轮南、英买力地区之后，在盆地中部地区获得的又一重大突破，进一步证实这个盆地蕴藏着丰富的油气资源。
    塔里木盆地塔中构造，是全国面积最大的巨型构造。据最新地震资料，构造圈闭面积达8200平方公里，构造顶部至底部最大幅度为1750米，具有丰富的油源和运移、聚集条件。
    这次塔中一井取得的重大突破，是“独立自主，自力更生”方针的胜利，是石油职工长期艰苦奋斗的结果。1983年以来，主要依靠自己的力量，引进和掌握国外现代沙漠数字地震技术，在塔克拉玛干大沙漠展开地震勘探，先后完成了横穿沙漠的19条数字地震大剖面，并结合盆地其他地区的一些深井资料，初步搞清了塔里木盆地的区域地质情况，在盆地腹部发现了几个大型和巨型构造。随后又在有利地区进一步开展地震工作，基本上查明了其中一些构造的分布位置、形态、规模及其地层组成。这就为塔中一井的钻探提供了地质依据。
    目前，新疆石油管理局钻井公司7015钻井队在其他单位密切配合下，仍在往深部继续钻探中。这里条件非常艰苦，夏天地面温度高达70℃，吃水困难，风沙弥漫，交通运输主要靠空运。总公司日前致电慰问在那里工作的石油职工。
