All members of the Pakistani cabinet submitted their resignations during a cabinet meeting on November 13 to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. However, it is unclear whether Benazir Bhutto has accepted their resignations.

According to the Pakistan Press International, the cabinet members expressed their complete trust and support for Benazir Bhutto’s leadership. Benazir Bhutto also stated that she would reorganize the cabinet at an appropriate time.

According to informed sources, these cabinet members submitted their resignations to pave the way for Benazir Bhutto to reorganize the cabinet.

Additionally, it was reported that three opposition party members joined Benazir Bhutto’s ruling People’s Party cabinet on November 11. President Ghulam Ishaq Khan presided over their oath-taking ceremony. Benazir Bhutto’s government aims to expand the base of the ruling party by absorbing opposition party members.

These three opposition party members all come from the Islamic National Alliance.

    巴基斯坦内阁部长提出辞职
    巴基斯坦内阁全体成员十三日在一次内阁会议上向贝·布托总理提出辞职，然而贝·布托是否已接受他们的辞呈尚不清楚。
    据巴基斯坦联合通讯社报道，内阁成员对贝·布托的领导表示完全信任和支持。贝·布托也表示她将在适当的时候改组内阁。
    另据此间消息灵通人士透露，这些内阁成员提出辞职是为贝·布托改组内阁铺平道路。
    另据报道，巴基斯坦的三名反对党议员十一日进入贝·布托总理领导的执政的人民党内阁。
    伊沙克·汗总统为他们的就职主持了宣誓仪式。贝·布托政府吸收反对党成员入阁旨在扩大执政党政府的基础。
    这三名反对党议员均来自伊斯兰民族联盟。
