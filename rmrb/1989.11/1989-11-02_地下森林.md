The vast underground forest, the warm sunlight cannot touch your trunk, the gentle rain cannot reach your leaves, the clear waters of Lake Beihai cannot moisten your parched throat, the barren soil lacks nourishment, yet you still grow so luxuriantly! Gazing at your towering form, your roots firmly embedded in the crevices of the rocks, I am lost in thought. It is because this land has shown you too much love, too much affection. It is because your roots are tightly grasping the conviction, closely connected with the earth. Underground forest, it is you who made me truly understand the bond between life and the earth: even the most stubborn life cannot exist without the earth.

    地下森林
    胡凤亭
    莽莽的地下森林呵，温暖的阳光摸不着你的躯干，盈盈雨露够不到你的枝叶，清澈的小北湖水润不湿你干渴的喉咙，贫瘠的瘦土缺少养份，你为何依然生长得这般繁荣！望着你挺拔的身躯，深深扎进石缝间的根须，我陷入了沉思。那是因为这块土地对你有太多太深的恩情，太多太深的爱恋。那是因为你的根紧紧地抓住了信念，与大地紧紧相连。地下森林呵，是你使我真正懂得了生命与大地的血肉之缘：再倔强的生命也离不开大地。
