Recently, the Hengyang County Audit Bureau, in collaboration with the County Civil Affairs Bureau, investigated the distribution, management, and use of poverty alleviation funds in the Xidu, Hongshi, and Zhajiang districts, as well as the Zhajiang Town of Kuzong Township. Several issues were discovered.

Arbitrary diversion and misuse. The Zhajiang District allocated 500,000 yuan in poverty alleviation loans, of which 315,000 yuan has been recovered. Only 60,000 yuan was remitted to the county. The district used 190,000 yuan for the cafeteria deficit, road construction, and toilet repairs. The district's civil affairs assistant used 32,000 yuan to purchase cabinets and electric fans. A leader in the Hongshi District arbitrarily borrowed 200,000 yuan from the welfare fund for the construction team. The Qutang Township used 41,200 yuan from the 650,000 yuan poverty alleviation loan for the township government to install electrical lines.

Misappropriation of public funds. A cadre in the Xianshui Township deposited 500,000 yuan from the 1 million yuan welfare fund allocated by the county civil affairs bureau into a personal savings account at the credit union, using it at his discretion. He lent 400,000 yuan to individuals and used 86,000 yuan for the township government's New Year's decorations and meeting expenses, with incomplete procedures.

Improper allocation of funds. The Xianshui, Sanhu, and three other townships collectively allocated 305,000 yuan in poverty alleviation funds to support 182 households. Of these, 56 households were supported based on relationships and personal connections, amounting to 110,500 yuan. The Lancao and Shuangqiao villages in Xianshui Township supported 7 households, all of whom were not actually in need but were village cadres. The civil affairs assistant in the Zhajiang District used 390,000 yuan to support 11 relatives and friends, some of whom have not yet repaid the funds after three years.

If these issues are not promptly addressed, they will seriously impact poverty alleviation efforts. It is recommended that all regions organize teams to conduct comprehensive audits, establish proper accounting systems, and ensure that funds are used for their intended purposes. Any issues identified should be seriously investigated and addressed.

    应抓好扶贫资金的发放和管理
    最近，湖南衡阳县审计局在县民政局的配合下，对西渡、洪市、渣江三个区和渣江镇库宗乡的扶贫资金发放、管理和使用情况进行了调查，发现存在不少问题。
    任意挤占挪用。渣江区发放扶贫贷款5万元，已经收回3.15万元，只上交县里0.6万元。区里用于食堂亏空、修路和维修厕所1.9万多元，区民政助理动用0.032万元购柜子和电风扇。洪市区一领导人擅自将福利事业周转金2万元借给区基建队使用。秋塘乡在0.65万元扶贫贷款中拿出0.412万元用于乡政府架设电线。
    公款据为私管。咸水乡一干部将县民政局拨的1万元周转金以私人存折存入信用社0.5万元，供自己掌管使用。他先后借给私人0.4万元，还用于乡政府春节接灯、开会等开支0.086万元，手续不健全。
    资金投放不当。咸水、三湖等3个乡共投放扶贫资金3.05万元，扶持182户，其中凭关系、感情扶持的有56户，资金1.105万元。咸水乡兰草、双桥两个村扶持的7户全是并不困难的村干部。渣江区民政助理动用0.39万元，扶持了11户亲戚朋友，其中有的款已有3年了尚未收回。
    上述问题如不尽快解决，势必给扶贫工作带来严重影响。建议各地组织力量进行全面清查；然后建制建账，做到专款专用；对前段出现的问题，要严肃查处。
