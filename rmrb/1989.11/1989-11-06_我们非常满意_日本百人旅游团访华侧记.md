The golden autumn, with leaves as red as fire, is the most beautiful season in Beijing. As the first large tour group from Japan to visit China after the Japanese government announced the lifting of the "self-restraint order" on September 25, the 100-person tour group visited Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven, the Great Wall, and other places from November 1 to 4. They experienced the honor of being "people's ambassadors" and felt the sincere friendship of the people of Beijing.

The members of the 100-person group came from various parts of Japan. The oldest member is 74 years old, and the three most active "little team members" are the youngest, with the youngest being just 5 years old.

On the first day of their arrival, the Kunlun Hotel held a welcome ceremony. The copper drum band from Guan Yuan Primary School played a lively welcome song, and the children sang and danced to welcome the guests.

In the afternoon of the 4th, it was time for the 100-person group to leave and return home. At noon, the group had a meal at the elegant "Honglou Restaurant." As the Chinese saying goes, "The dumplings sent off are as good as the noodles that welcome." This time, in addition to exquisite dishes, they also served dumplings, which the Japanese guests love to eat.

Led by Liu Jianjun, 8 Japanese-speaking guides from the China Travel Service are outstanding business elites. They worked hard to meet every request of the guests. The three little boys received special care from Liu Jianjun.

"I am very satisfied with this trip. My deepest impression is that all the Beijing people we met were very enthusiastic," said Uetani Aiko, a member of the 100-person group and a housewife from Yokohama.

She felt that this trip was very rewarding, "I have a new understanding of Beijing, this historical ancient capital. Due to the impact of the 'June Fourth' incident, I was a bit worried before coming. After arriving in Beijing, I did not find anything unusual."

Aiko and her husband, who works as the head of the transportation department at a shipping company, each bought a memorable souvenir. Aiko bought a fur coat, feeling that the style and price were both ideal. Her husband bought the "four treasures of the study." Aiko said with a sense of parting, "I especially hope to come again in the future."

Kakiuchi Takafumi, from Gifu City, is visiting Beijing for the third time. He said, "After returning to Japan, I will tell my friends that China is a very good place to visit."

This 100-person tour group was organized by the Japan Travel Bureau. The bureau is one of the largest travel agencies in Japan. In early September, they contacted us to inquire about the price for a "Beijing-only tour." Shortly after the "self-restraint order" was lifted at the end of September, they advertised in major Japanese newspapers to recruit tourists, and within half an hour, the number of applicants exceeded the limit. Later, they had to divide the group into two, with Team A having 97 people, known as the "100-person group"; Team B having 53 people, entering one day later.

Kazunobu Wada, the manager of the China Travel Sales Department of the Japan Travel Bureau, is the Japanese leader of the 100-person tour group. He believes that this tour was successful. For a travel agency, providing satisfactory service to tourists is a matter of course. The China International Travel Service, the Japan Travel Bureau, and "All Nippon Airways" have all made efforts.

    “我们非常满意” 
    ——日本百人旅游团访华侧记
    本报记者　刘霄
    霜叶如火的金秋，是北京一年中最美的季节。作为日本政府9月25日宣布解除“自律令”后的第一个大型访华旅游团——百人旅游团，11月1日至4日畅游了天安门、故宫、天坛、长城等处。他们实地体会到“人民大使”的殊荣，感受到北京人的真挚情意。
    百人团团员来自日本各地，年龄最大的已有74岁，3个最活跃的“小不点团员”，最小的刚满5岁。
    初到之日，昆仑饭店举行了欢迎仪式。官园小学的铜鼓乐队奏起热情洋溢的迎宾曲，孩子们载歌载舞欢迎宾客。
    4日下午就要离境回国了。中午，百人团在典雅的“红楼饭庄”进膳。中国俗话道：“送行的饺子接风的面”。这次，除了精致菜肴外，还真的上了日本客人最爱吃的饺子。
    以刘建军为首的8名日语陪同，是国旅总社优秀的业务骨干，分别为日本游客担任导游。他们尽了很大的努力，尽量满足客人的每一个要求。那3个小男孩受到刘建军的特别关照。
    “我对这次旅行非常满意。最深的感受，就是所有遇到的北京人对我们都非常热情。”百人团团员、来自横滨市的家庭主妇上谷爱子说道。
    她认为这次旅游收获蛮大，“对北京这座历史古都有了新的了解。由于‘六四’事件的影响，来前有点担心。到北京后，没有发现任何异常的地方。”
    爱子和在远洋公司任交通部部长的丈夫，各自选购了得意的纪念品。爱子买了一件毛皮大衣，感到款式、价格都很理想。丈夫则买了“文房四宝”。爱子怀着惜别之情说：“特别希望以后再来。”
    来自岐阜市的垣贝孝文，已经是第三次到北京了。他说：“回国以后，我要告诉朋友们，中国是一个很好的游览胜地。”
    这个百人旅游团是日本交通公社组织的。该社是日本最大的旅行社之一。9月初，他们就来电了解“北京一地游”的报价。9月底，劝告公民不要来华的“自律令”解除后不久，他们在日本各大报登出广告，招募游客，半个小时就超过报名限额。后来，不得不分成两个团，A团97人，就是统称为“百人团”的；B团53人，晚一天入境。
    日本交通公社中国旅行销售课课长和田正信是百人旅游团的日方领队。他认为这次组团是成功的。对旅行社来说，为游客提供满意服务是分内之事。中国的国际旅行总社、日本的交通公社和“全日本航空公司”都做出了努力。
