Farmers in Xuzhou Conduct Environmental Impact Assessment

Farmers in Xuzhou's Pipa Village pooled their resources to invite experts to investigate and evaluate their living environment, a first in China. Experts from the Northwest Institute of Soil and Water Conservation were deeply moved by the environmental awareness of the villagers in Xuzhou's Pipa Village and signed a contract with the farmers at the lowest possible cost, charging only for materials.

Since the late 1950s, seven chemical plants have been built around Pipa Village, which has a population of over 900 households. The wastewater, waste gas, and waste residue from these plants have polluted the farmland, irrigation water, and drinking water, leading to reduced grain and vegetable yields. In 1982, only two out of 100 children in the village passed a health check.

The experts conducted two on-site investigations, conducting detailed chemical analyses of the village's soil, grains, drinking water, and human hair samples. They submitted a report titled "Investigation of Industrial Pollution in the Agricultural Environment of Pipa Village, Northern Suburb of Xuzhou City." The experts pointed out that due to the influence of industrial "three wastes," the content of heavy metals and volatile phenols and arsenic in the water bodies around Pipa Village significantly exceeded the standards. The growth and development of crops were affected, with cadmium and fluorine content in wheat exceeding food hygiene standards. Some soils were salinized and compacted, leading to a significant decline in soil quality.

The experts made several recommendations to the villagers based on the pollution situation in Pipa Village. They suggested changing the crops grown in heavily polluted areas to economic crops, using contaminated grains for industrial purposes, planting different anti-pollution crops based on different polluting elements, and selecting appropriate tree species to create protective forests.

    徐州农民搞环境评价
    农民集资请专家对他们的生活环境进行调查评价，这在我国尚属首例。西北水土保持研究所的专家们深为徐州郊区琵琶村村民的环境意识所感动，以只收工本费的最低价与农民签订了协议书。
    自50年代后期起，900多户人口的琵琶村周围相继建起了7个化工企业。这些企业的废水、废气、废渣污染了农田、灌溉用水和饮用水，造成粮、菜减产。1982年，全村百名入托儿童体检合格的只有两人。
    专家们通过两次实地调查，对琵琶村的土壤、粮食、饮用水和人发样品进行了详细的化验和分析，提出了《徐州市北郊琵琶村农业环境的工业污染调查》报告。专家们指出，受工业“三废”影响，琵琶村周围水体中重金属和挥发性酚、砷的含量明显超标；农作物生长发育受到影响，小麦中镉、氟含量超过食品卫生标准；部分土壤盐渍化、板结，土壤质量严重下降。
    专家们针对琵琶村的污染情况，向农民提出了对重度污染地块改种经济作物，把已受污染的粮食作为工业用粮，根据不同污染元素种植不同的抗污染作物和选择适宜树种营造防护林等项建议。
