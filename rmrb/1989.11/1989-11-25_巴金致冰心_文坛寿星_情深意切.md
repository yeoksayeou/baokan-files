Ba Jin to Bing Xin

Dear Elder Sister Bing Xin,

I received your letter dated the 7th. Before that, I had already seen your smile on the screen. In the *Xinmin Evening News*, I read about the joy and flowers in your home, and our family was very happy, as if we were all by your side, celebrating your birthday. We wish you good health and longevity, and we believe you will definitely be healthy and long-lived. What is even more precious is that for over seventy years, you have never put down your pen. You have always been a teacher and friend to young students. Ninety years old! You are not old! Your articles still move the hearts of millions of readers. Recently, I often think that you are like a bright lamp. Seeing the light, we feel at ease.

My hand trembles badly, so I will stop writing now. Goodbye.

Greetings to your entire family.

Ba Jin, October 12th

I miss you, but my sick body is unbearably painful, especially since I cannot write letters to express my heartfelt feelings.

Ba Jin

Dear Elder Sister Bing Xin,

I have been in the hospital for over two months, and my health has improved, allowing me to write this letter by hand. But I can only write a couple of lines, and it is very tiring. I just wanted to tell you that last night we were very happy to watch the television program about you. Your smile is deeply imprinted in my mind. I want to watch it again, three times.

Please take care of yourself and wish you good health and longevity!

Ba Jin, May 5th

For seventy years, I have been following you!

This year, on October 5th, it was the 90th birthday of Elder Bing Xin. On November 25th, it was the 85th birthday of Elder Ba Jin. We are publishing two letters from Ba Jin to Bing Xin this year to express our congratulations.

    巴金致冰心
　　文坛寿星　情深意切冰心大姊：
    收到您七日的信。在这之前我已在荧屏上见到您的笑容。在《新民晚报》上读到您府上一片欢笑，满屋鲜花的报道，我们一家人都很高兴，仿佛都在您身边，欢庆您的生日。我们祝您健康长寿，也相信您一定健康长寿。更难得的是七十几年来您一直不曾放下您的笔，您一直是青年学生的老师和朋友。九十岁！您并不老！您的文章还打动千万读者的心。最近我常常想，您好像一盏明亮的灯，看见灯光，我们就放心了。
    手抖得厉害，不写了，再见。
    问候您全家。
                巴金　十月十二日
    想念你们，但抱病之身痛苦不堪，尤其是无法写信吐露我满腹的感情。
                  巴金冰心大姊：
    在医院住了两个多月，健康有好转，可以亲笔写信了。但也只能写两三行，累得很。只为了告诉您，我们昨天晚上非常高兴地看了关于您的电视片。您的笑容深深地印在我的脑子里。我还想再看，三看。
    请保重，祝您健康！长寿！
                巴金　五月五日
    七十年了，我还在跟着您前进！
    今年10月5日，是冰心老人九十大寿，11月25日是巴金老人八十五大寿，特发表今年巴金致冰心的书信二封，以表贺忱。					　　　——编者
