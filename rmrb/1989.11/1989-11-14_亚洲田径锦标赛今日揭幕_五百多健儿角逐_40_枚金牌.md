The Asian Athletics Championships open today

More than 500 athletes to compete for 40 gold medals

NEW DELHI, Nov. 13 (Xinhua) — The eighth Asian Athletics Championships are set to begin, and the host country, India, is striving to make this championship a grand international sports event. However, complaints are still being voiced.

The championships, to be held from November 14 to 19, are the largest sports event India has hosted since the Ninth Asian Games in 1982. More than 500 athletes from 33 countries and regions in Asia will compete for 40 gold medals. China has sent 51 top athletes to participate in all events.

Although the Indian government attaches great importance to this championship, complaints from various quarters continue. First, the athletes' village is far from the stadium, and athletes need to travel for an hour on winding roads to reach the venue. Journalists are also dissatisfied with the rudimentary communication facilities; there is only one international direct-dial telephone for journalists, but there are more than 50 foreign journalists covering the event. Reporters from Taiwan complained that they have been here for three days but have not been able to send back a single report. The organizers of the championships said that as the opening date approaches, all preparations will be improved.

    亚洲田径锦标赛今日揭幕
    五百多健儿角逐40枚金牌
    据新华社新德里11月13日电 （记者黄平）第八届亚洲田径锦标赛开赛在即，东道国印度正努力把这一锦标赛办成盛大的国际体育盛会，但抱怨声仍不绝于耳。
    将于14日至19日在这里举行的亚洲田径锦标赛，是自1982年第九届亚运会以来印度所主办的最大型的体育盛会，来自亚洲33个国家和地区的500多名运动员将在田径场上争夺40枚金牌。中国队派出了51名国内一流好手参加全部项目比赛。
    尽管印度政府十分重视这次锦标赛，但来自各方面的抱怨声仍不绝于耳。首先是运动员村距离赛场较远，运动员需在弯弯曲曲的道路上坐一个小时的汽车方可到达赛场；记者们则对简陋的通讯设备表示不满，这里只有一部为记者提供的国际直通电话，而来采访的外国记者有50人之多，中国台北记者抱怨说，他们到这里已经3天了，但一条稿子也发不回去。锦标赛的组织者说，随着开幕的日期临近，各种准备工作将会完善起来。
