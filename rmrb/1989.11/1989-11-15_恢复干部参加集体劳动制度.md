	In recent years, some of our party and government cadres have diluted the concept of labor. It is suggested that the system of party and government cadres participating in collective labor be restored, and that it be included as a component of strengthening the education of clean governance in the organs. Insisting on cadres participating in collective labor is a fine tradition of our party. It is beneficial for understanding the people's sentiments, grasping public opinion, communicating thoughts, and strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses. It is also beneficial for overcoming bureaucratism.

    恢复干部参加集体劳动制度
    近些年来，我们一些党政干部淡化了劳动观念。建议恢复党政机关干部参加集体劳动制度，并把它作为加强机关廉政建设教育的一项内容。坚持干部参加集体劳动，是我们党的优良传统作风。它有利于体察民情，了解民意，沟通思想，密切干群关系，有利于克服官僚主义。
