Morning
Accompanied by tranquility, with the dawn's first light, morning arrives silently, without a sound, yet with boundless charm and myriad allure. It brings the colors of spring to the world, awakens the bustling city, not merely in beautiful moments. The night's explorations condense into the radiance of thought, scattered across rivers, mountains, and valleys. Neither proud from praise nor disheartened by envy, your life flows, offering deep affection.
