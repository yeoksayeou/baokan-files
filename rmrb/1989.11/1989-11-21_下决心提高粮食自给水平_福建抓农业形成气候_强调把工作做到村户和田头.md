Fujian Focuses on Agriculture to Create a Trend

Emphasizes Taking Work to Villages, Households, and Fields

FUZHOU, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) — Long-term grain-deficient Fujian Province, while studying and implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, has realized that the situation of relying on others for food must change. The province has decided to rely on its own resources, revise plans to continuously improve grain self-sufficiency levels, and ensure stable growth in grain production as a key task, creating a strong atmosphere of focusing on agriculture across the province.

Agricultural development relies on leadership. Due to the influence of the idea that "farming is not as good as running a factory, and running a factory is not as good as doing business," some local leaders have not paid enough attention to agriculture in recent times. Fujian Province requires county and district leaders to focus their main efforts on developing agriculture, especially grain production. It advocates reviving the "mud-legged" spirit of the 1950s, taking practical measures to villages, households, and fields. Leaders should lead by example in planting experimental fields and promoting agricultural technological achievements. At the same time, a responsibility system should be established, with the development of agriculture, including targets, tasks, measures, methods, and momentum, as an important standard for evaluating cadres.

In response to the weak foundation of agricultural infrastructure, Fujian Province is organizing counties, townships, and villages to start production competitions focused on winter planting and winter repairs. Idle labor and labor released from rectification and streamlining are being mobilized to invest in water conservancy projects, transforming low- and medium-yield fields, afforestation, and building rural roads. While educating farmers to increase agricultural investment, Fujian Province has decided that starting next year, 10% of the increased fiscal revenue will be used to develop agriculture. It is required that local governments, cities, and counties should use as much of their discretionary funds as possible for agriculture.

To stabilize sowing areas, Fujian Province is strengthening the protection of existing arable land while seriously implementing the "Grain Project," carrying out comprehensive treatment of low- and medium-yield fields, reclaiming wasteland, and improving drought-prone land. To increase land use efficiency, the provincial science and technology department is also promoting intercropping and developing "vertical farming."

Given the current situation of grain and some agricultural products being unsold and accumulating, Fujian Province is organizing relevant departments to actively do a good job in grain procurement and transportation. It ensures that the funds needed for contracted grain purchases are available, and no "blank checks" are issued. At the same time, it implements a protective price purchase for negotiated grain. For accumulated and unsold fruits and aquatic products, preferential policies are adopted in terms of taxation and pricing to help farmers sell their products, ensuring that farmers increase production and income, and protecting farmers' interests and production enthusiasm.

Fujian Province is also promoting a batch of high-level agricultural research achievements with low investment, high yield, and strong applicability. It focuses on building a science and technology promotion network with townships and villages as the key, training agricultural technicians, and ensuring the organizational promotion of scientific and technological achievements. On the basis of continuing to do a good job in 100 science and technology demonstration townships, it is accelerating the implementation of the "Harvest Plan" and the "Spark Plan."

### 下决心提高粮食自给水平　福建抓农业形成气候　强调把工作做到村户和田头

　　下决心提高粮食自给水平
　　福建抓农业形成气候
　　强调把工作做到村户和田头
    本报福州11月20日电　记者张铭清报道：长期缺粮的福建省，在学习贯彻党的十三届五中全会精神时，痛感把自己的饭碗摆在别人家的锅台上的现状必须改变，决心立足省内，修订好不断提高粮食自给水平的规划，把保证粮食生产稳定增长作为硬任务来抓，在全省形成抓农业的大气候。
    农业上台阶，领导是关键。由于受“种田不如办厂，办厂不如经商”的思想影响，前一段时间，一些地方领导对农业重视不够。福建省要求地、县两级要把主要精力放在发展农业特别是粮食生产上；提倡发扬50年代“泥腿子”作风，把落实工作做到村、户和田头；领导要带头种试验田，推广农业科技成果。同时，建立责任制，把发展农业的目标、任务、措施、方法、后劲等作为考核干部的一条重要标准。
    针对农业基础建设薄弱的状况，福建省正组织各县、乡、村开始以冬种冬修为重点的生产竞赛。组织闲散劳力和治理整顿中压缩下来的劳力投入兴修水利、改造中低产田、植树造林及修建农村公路等。在教育农民增加农业投入的同时，福建省确定，从明年开始，每年财政增收部分的10％用于发展农业。要求各地、市、县都要尽可能把较多的机动财力用于农业。
    为了稳定播种面积，福建省在加强对现有耕地保护的同时，认真实施“粮食工程”，开展中低产田综合治理，因地制宜围垦开荒，抓好旱地工程改造。为提高土地利用率，省科技部门还推广间作套种，发展“立体农业”。
    鉴于目前粮食和一些农产品出现滞销积压的情况，福建省正组织有关部门积极做好粮食收购、调运工作，保证合同定购内粮食所需资金，不打“白条”，同时，实行保护价收购议价粮。对积压滞销的水果、水产品，从税收、价格等方面采取优惠政策，帮助农民推销，使农民增产增收，保护农民利益和生产积极性。
    福建省还对一批较高水平的农业科研成果中花钱少、增产多、适用性强的项目进行重点推广，突出抓以乡、村为重点的科技推广网络建设，培训农民技术员，以使科技成果的推广在组织上得到保证。在继续搞好100个科技示范乡的基础上，加快实施“丰收计划”和“星火计划”。
