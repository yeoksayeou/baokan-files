Xinhua News Agency, Windhoek, November 9th.

In Namibia's five-day parliamentary elections, 424,000 out of the 700,000 registered voters have already cast their ballots in the first two days.

Reports from the eastern Caprivi region indicate that 74.7% of the 28,000 registered voters have already voted.

In the most densely populated Ovamboland region, nearly 170,000 out of the 248,000 registered voters have cast their ballots, with a voter turnout of 64.5%.

In the capital, Windhoek, more than half of the registered voters have already voted.

Although the United Nations assistance team and the South African administrator in Namibia are both satisfied with the election process, opposing parties continue to accuse each other of electoral fraud.
