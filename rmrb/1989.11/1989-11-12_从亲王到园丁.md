Located at the intersection of West Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, Lake Constance is like a gleaming mirror fallen from heaven, reflecting the snowy peaks of the Alps and the lush forests of Bavaria. Along the lake, there are about twenty to thirty towns of various sizes, each with its own unique charm, like a string of sparkling pearls adorned around this mirror. Which pearl is the most beautiful? Is it Konstanz, or Lindau? Is it Ludwigshafen, or Meersburg? It's hard to say. However, one pearl stands out with its unique radiance: Mainau Island in Konstanz. No tourist would leave without visiting it.

Mainau Island is not large, covering only 4.5 hectares. It attracts visitors with its world-renowned gardens and flowers that bloom almost year-round. Every April, this "Island of Flowers" awakens. The first to announce the arrival of spring are the vibrant tulips. Imagine 600,000 tulips blooming amidst 200,000 pansies, displaying their beauty against the backdrop of mountains and water—what a magnificent sight! As the tulips retreat, the colorful roses take the stage. The southern part of the island is an Italian-style rose garden with 1,300 varieties and over 30,000 roses. Years of meticulous cultivation have made the roses grow robustly. I visited there in June and was astonished by the clusters of roses taller than a person and countless blooms. The eastern end of the island is a rhododendron slope, where over 280 varieties of rhododendrons compete in beauty.

When the autumn winds begin to blow, the island becomes the realm of dahlias. Visitors select the "Dahlia Queen" from 200 of the most beautiful dahlias to celebrate the end of the flower season. Mainau Island is also home to many tropical and subtropical plants, such as oranges, bananas, lemons, and palms, all benefiting from Lake Constance's "greenhouse" effect. The island also has several glasshouses displaying various rare orchids. A Baroque-style palace and an adjacent small chapel, with their golden and elegant exteriors, add a sense of dignity and elegance to Mainau Island. Each year, it attracts up to 2 million visitors with its enchanting charm.

The beauty of Mainau Island today is all thanks to its owner, Count Lennart Bernadotte, a descendant of the Swedish royal family. His legendary journey from a prince to a commoner, willing to break with the royal family and reduce his status, has been a topic of conversation among the European public for many years, just like the beautiful scenery of Mainau Island.

Lennart Bernadotte was born on May 8, 1909, in the Swedish royal palace. His father was Prince Wilhelm, the second son of King Gustav V of Sweden at the time, and his mother was Maria Pavlovna, the beloved daughter of Grand Duke Paul, the seventh son of Tsar Alexander II of Russia, who reigned in the late 19th century.

As soon as Lennart was born, he was granted the title of a hereditary prince and the Duke of Småland. Born into the palace, as the grandson of the king, his childhood was filled with endless splendor and wealth. However, he never experienced true human warmth. His parents' marriage was a political alliance common among European royal families at the time, with no love involved. This eventually forced his mother to bravely propose a divorce when he was only four years old and leave Sweden forever. This child, who had lost his mother's love at an early age, had to endure countless palace rules and regulations as soon as he began to understand the world. His grandmother, steeped in royal power, forbade him from playing with common children, forced him to read long passages from the Bible and pray every morning, and he also had to be taken to various royal family celebrations and funerals around Europe as a Swedish prince. Even after starting school, his every move was still supervised and restricted. Lennart often felt like he was suffocating in an airless iron house.

His childhood dream was to become a doctor, but his grandmother scolded him: "Taking money from common people with runny noses for medical treatment is a great disgrace!" He later wrote in his autobiography: "Spiritual rape has serious consequences. The consciousness of seeking liberation, the struggle to be recognized as a complete person with one's own thoughts and rights, the efforts to take control of one's own destiny—all these have caused intense spiritual friction in the palace."

After growing up, Prince Lennart challenged the Swedish royal family for love. He fell in love with a commoner, Karin Nissvandt, and the royal family strongly opposed it. In February 1931, when he bravely announced to the press that they were engaged, the entire European royal family was shocked by his decision to marry a commoner instead of a royal. The Swedish royal family therefore stripped him of all his titles and privileges and prohibited him from holding a wedding ceremony on Swedish soil.

After that, Lennart Bernadotte was "exiled" to Mainau Island on Lake Constance. The island was originally given to his grandmother by her father, Grand Duke Friedrich I of Baden, and his grandmother then gave it to his father. When he arrived on the island in 1932, it was desolate, the palace was in disrepair, and it was called the "floating jungle" on Lake Constance. Lennart, freed from the royal family's constraints, decided to transform it into a public garden.

After World War II, he devoted all his efforts and finally turned Mainau Island into a famous, fairy-tale-like "Paradise of Flowers." In addition, he engaged in extensive social activities to promote peace and human progress. When the first meeting of Nobel Prize winners was held in Lindau on the shores of Lake Constance in 1951, he was elected as the chairman of the board of directors and served until 1987. He invited politicians, scientists, and artists to participate in the "Mainau Dialogue" every year to exchange views on urgent issues facing humanity. In July 1961, he and the participants of the "Mainau Dialogue" jointly issued the "Mainau Green Charter," calling on people to pay attention to protecting the natural environment in the era of technological progress. He can be said to be one of the pioneers of the contemporary environmental protection movement.

He held Mainau Island flower photography exhibitions in more than 30 cities in Europe, America, and Japan, gave speeches, and raised public awareness of environmental protection. In 1974, he turned Mainau Island and all its garden facilities into the property of a foundation named after him, with the purpose of promoting environmental protection, cultural heritage preservation, and land management.

Lennart's activities have earned him widespread respect around the world, and he has been awarded a series of medals, decorations, and honorary doctorates by several countries. He served as the chairman of the German Horticultural Society for several decades. His aunt, Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg, later awarded him the title of "Count of Wisborg." But he did not value this title. He said, unfortunately, people always treat titles as sacred, but being a count is far from being as easy and happy as being a commoner. Now, at the age of 80, Lennart and his second wife, a German woman named Sonja who worked as a telephone operator, accountant, and later studied horticulture on Mainau Island, still lead 450 workers every day to carefully tend to this "Paradise of Flowers," practicing his own motto: "I am a gardener serving the public."

    从亲王到园丁
    江建国
    位于西德、奥地利和瑞士三国交界处的博登湖像是自天堂跌落的一面亮锃锃的宝镜，映照着阿尔卑斯山峰上的皑皑白雪、巴伐利亚葱郁的森林。沿湖二三十个大小城镇各具风姿，像一串晶莹的珍珠镶嵌在这块镜子的周围。哪颗珍珠更美？是康斯坦茨，还是林道？是路德维希港，还是梅尔斯堡？实在很难说。不过，有那么一颗却放射着异样的光彩：康斯坦茨的美瑙岛。没有一个游客会绕过它而离去。
    美瑙岛并不大，区区4.5公顷而已。它以其在全欧洲都闻名的园林和一年三季开不败的种种鲜花吸引着游人的目光、摄影家的镜头和画家的笔触。每年的4月，这个“花岛”就苏醒了。最先传达春天信息的是热烈奔放的郁金香。试想一下，60万株郁金香在20万棵三色堇的烘托下一下子在山光水色之间展现其姣美的容颜时，该是多么壮观！郁金香刚刚退出舞台，多彩多姿的玫瑰就登场了。岛的南部是意大利式的玫瑰园，总计有1300个品种，3万多棵。多年的精心栽培，玫瑰长得十分茁壮。我6月间到过那里，简直被丛丛一人多高的玫瑰和数不清的花朵惊呆了。岛的东端是杜鹃坡，280多种杜鹃花在这里争奇斗艳。
    秋风乍起时，那里又成了天竺牡丹的天下，游客们从200种最漂亮的天竺牡丹中挑选“天竺牡丹女王”，庆祝鲜花季节的结束。美瑙岛上，许多热带、亚热带的植物，如柑桔、香蕉、柠檬，棕榈等也得益于博登湖这个“大温室”而在那里安家落户。岛上还建了几间玻璃暖房，展出种种珍奇的兰花。一座巴罗克式的宫殿和毗邻的小教堂里雕梁画栋，它们那金碧辉煌、简洁明快的外表给美瑙岛平添了一种端庄、典雅的风韵。每年它就是以这样一股迷人的魅力招来多达200万的游客。
    美瑙岛之有今天的魅力全要归功于它的主人——瑞典王室后裔莱纳特·贝那多特伯爵。这位当年至尊至贵的瑞典亲王，不惜与王室决裂，甘愿自降为平民的传奇般的经历，同美瑙岛的良辰美景一样，多年来始终是欧洲公众津津乐道的话题。
    莱纳特·贝那多特1909年5月8日诞生于瑞典王宫之中。他的父亲是当时的瑞典国王古斯塔夫五世的次子威廉王子，母亲玛丽亚·帕夫洛夫娜，是19世纪后期在位的俄国沙皇亚历山大二世第七个儿子保罗大公的掌上明珠。
    莱纳特一降生，就被册封为有继承权的大公兼斯马兰德公爵。莱纳特生于宫廷，贵为国王的孙子，他的童年自有享不尽的荣华富贵。然而，他从来没有享受过真正的人间温暖。他父母的结合是当时欧洲王室之间常见的政治联姻，毫无爱情可言，终于迫使他的母亲在他年仅4岁的时候大胆地提出离婚，并永远离开了瑞典。这个早早失去母爱的孩子刚刚懂事，却不得不忍受无数宫廷清规戒律的折磨。皇权思想浓厚的祖母禁止他与平民的孩子一起玩耍，强迫他天天早晨读一段长长的圣经，进行晨祷，此外，他还得以瑞典亲王的身份被带到欧洲各地去参加各国王室亲戚们的庆典和葬礼。直到上了小学之后，他的行踪还处处有人监护管束。莱纳特常常感到像身处在一个没有空气的铁屋子里一般窒息。
    他少年时代的理想是当个医生，祖母却给他一顿训斥：“从那些流着大鼻涕的平民百姓手里收取诊疗费过日子，是个天大的耻辱！”他后来在自传中写道：“精神上的强奸带来严重的后果。要求解放的意识，为被承认为一个有自己思想和权利的完整的人而进行的抗争，争取掌握自己的命运的努力，这一切都在宫廷中引起强烈的精神摩擦。”
    莱纳特亲王成年之后，为了追求爱情向瑞典王室提出了挑战。他与一平民女子卡琳·尼斯万特相恋，王室万般阻挠。1931年2月，当他勇敢地向报界公布了两人订婚的消息后，整个欧洲王室都为他竟然不与王室联姻，娶平民女子为妻的举动感到震惊。瑞典王室因此取消了他的一切头衔和特权，同时禁止他在瑞典土地上举行婚礼。
    此后，莱纳特·贝那多特就被“放逐”到博登湖上的美瑙岛来。这个小岛早年由他祖母的父亲——巴登大公弗里德利希一世馈赠给他的祖母，他的祖母又转赠给他的父亲。1932年他来到岛上时，一片荒芜，宫殿失修，人称为“博登湖上的浮动丛林”。摆脱了王室束缚的莱纳特决心把它改造成一座供公众欣赏的大花园。
    第二次世界大战后，他倾注全力，终于把美瑙岛建成了遐迩闻名、童话般的“花之天堂”。此外，他投身到广泛的争取和平和人类进步的社会活动中去。在博登湖畔的林道定期举行的诺贝尔奖金获得者会议1951年首次召开时，他就被选为理事会主席，直到1987年；他每年邀请政治家、科学家和艺术家参加“美瑙对话”，就人类面临的迫切问题交换意见。1961年7月他与“美瑙对话”的参加者共同发表了“美瑙绿色宪章”，呼吁人们在科技进步的今天，注意保护自然环境，可以说他是当代环境保护运动的先驱之一。
    他在欧美、日本的30多个城市举办美瑙岛花卉摄影展览会，发表讲演，唤起公众的环保觉悟。1974年他把美瑙岛连同所有的园林设施变为以他的名字命名的基金会财产，宗旨就是促进环境保护、文物保护和领土整治。
    莱纳特的这些活动赢得世界上广泛的尊敬，被几个国家授予一系列奖章和勋章以及名誉博士等等。他担任了几十年的西德园林协会主席。他的姑姑、卢森堡女大公夏洛蒂后来又授予他一个“维斯博格伯爵”的爵位。但他并不看重这个头衔。他说，可惜人们老是对头衔敬若神明，其实当个伯爵远不比当个老百姓更轻松愉快。如今，年满80的莱纳特与他的第二个妻子、在美瑙岛上当过电话员、会计、又自修了园艺知识的西德人索妮亚一起，仍然每天带领450个工作人员，精心装扮这个“花之天堂”，实践着自己的箴言：“我是个为公众服务的园丁”。
