Chinese and Bulgarian foreign ministers held talks in Beijing today, expressing concern over the current situation in some European countries. Both sides, however, agreed that these are internal affairs of the respective countries and that the principle of non-interference in internal affairs should be upheld.

Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Petar Mladenov this afternoon at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.

In discussing bilateral relations, both foreign ministers agreed that over the 40 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the relationship between the two countries has generally been developing. In particular, in recent years, the relationship has seen good progress in all areas.

Qian Qichen said that both countries are undergoing economic reforms and are seeking new ways to develop economic and trade relations.

Qian Qichen also briefed on the situation of China's domestic development.

Mladenov said that the relationship between the two parties, the two governments, and the people of the two countries has been well developed.

Mladenov emphasized the need to develop economic and trade relations between the two countries on a mutually beneficial basis. He also expressed the hope to further improve cooperation in science and technology and culture.

In discussing international issues, Mladenov said that the two countries have similar or identical views on many issues. Especially on major issues, the evaluations are consistent. Mladenov said that Bulgaria attaches great importance to China's reform experience. Because, the two countries have many common points in this regard, and also face common problems.

Mladenov also invited Qian to visit Bulgaria, and Qian accepted the invitation with pleasure.

After the talks, the two foreign ministers signed the "Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Bulgaria for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital," the "Agreement on Cooperation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Bulgaria," and the "1989-1990 Scientific and Cultural Cooperation Plan between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Bulgaria."
