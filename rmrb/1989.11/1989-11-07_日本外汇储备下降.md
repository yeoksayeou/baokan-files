Japan's foreign exchange reserves declined again at the end of October, according to a report released by the Japanese Ministry of Finance on November 1. The reserves stood at $84.293 billion, a decrease of $1.824 billion from the previous month.

According to a report by the Jiji Press, Japan's foreign exchange reserves have cumulatively decreased by $1.6068 billion from May to October this year. The report stated that the significant drop in reserves over the past six months is primarily due to the Bank of Japan's efforts to curb further appreciation of the U.S. dollar by selling dollars and buying yen. However, Japan's foreign exchange reserves remain the highest among all countries.

    日本外汇储备下降
    新华社东京电　日本大藏省1日公布的10月末外汇储备额为842.93亿美元，比上月末又减少18.24亿美元。
    据时事社报道，从今年5月到10月，日本外汇储备累计下降额已达160.68亿美元。报道说，外汇储备额在半年内大幅度下降，主要是由于日本银行为抑制美元进一步升值而采取了抛售美元、购进日元的结果。但是，日本外汇储备目前仍居各国之首。
