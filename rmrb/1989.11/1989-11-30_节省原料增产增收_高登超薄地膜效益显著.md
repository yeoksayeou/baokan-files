A type of ultra-thin film that significantly saves scarce chemical raw materials has emerged in Beijing, bringing good news for agricultural production and farmers' income.

Beijing Highden Enterprise Co., Ltd. has introduced a new multi-layer composite technology for producing films from abroad, creating an ultra-thin film that is only one-third the thickness of ordinary domestic films but has equally remarkable yield-increasing effects. This has attracted the attention of relevant experts.

It is understood that over the past two years, Highden ultra-thin film has been adopted by technical promotion departments and production units in more than ten provinces and autonomous regions across the country. The covered crops include both grain crops and economic crops, with good yield-increasing benefits. In the cold and arid region of Hebei Province's Laiyuan County, before 1978, due to climatic limitations, the average yield of corn per mu was only over 200 kilograms. Later, this county began to use film covering technology, and the yield of corn increased significantly. However, due to the high price of the film, the increase in yield did not translate into increased income. After replacing the ordinary film with Highden ultra-thin film, costs were saved. This year, the 13,000 mu of corn covered with the film had an average yield of 662.7 kilograms per mu, an increase of 59% compared to the yield without film coverage, with an additional pure income of 122.5 yuan per mu.

Relevant experts told reporters that at present, the area of crops covered with film in China is about 40 million mu, covering more than 40 varieties of crops. If the standard of Laiyuan County is used to cover these 40 million mu of land with ordinary film, 260,000 tons of film will be needed. If Highden ultra-thin film is used instead, only 92,000 tons will be needed. This is of great significance for easing the tight supply of polyethylene in China and accelerating the pace of farmers' enrichment.

### 节省原料增产增收　高登超薄地膜效益显著

　　节省原料增产增收
　　高登超薄地膜效益显著
    本报讯　记者江夏、刘建林报道：一种大量节约紧缺化工原料的超薄地膜在北京问世，为农业增产、农民增收带来福音。
    北京高登企业有限公司从国外引进生产地膜的多层复合新技术，生产出厚度仅为国产普通地膜1／3、增产效果同样显著的超薄地膜，引起有关专家的重视。
    据了解，高登超薄地膜近两年正被全国十几个省区的技术推广部门和生产单位采用，覆膜作物既有粮食作物，也有经济作物，增产效益良好。高寒干旱的河北省涞源县，1978年以前因受气候限制，玉米平均亩产仅有200多公斤。后来，这个县开始采用地膜覆盖技术，玉米产量有了大幅度提高。但是，由于地膜价格偏高，增产并未增收。用高登超薄地膜取代普通地膜后，节约了开支。今年覆膜的1.3万亩玉米，平均每亩实产玉米662.7公斤，比没地膜覆盖的亩产增加59％，每亩纯增收入122.5元。
    有关专家告诉记者，目前我国地膜覆盖的作物面积大约4000万亩，覆盖作物品种达40多个。若按涞源县的标准用普通地膜覆盖，这4000万亩地需用地膜26万吨，若改用高登超薄地膜，仅需9.2万吨。这对于缓解我国聚乙烯供求紧张状况、加快农民致富步伐很有意义。
