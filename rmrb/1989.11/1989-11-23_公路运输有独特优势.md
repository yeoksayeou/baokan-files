	Road transport has unique advantages
	Deputy Director of the Policy Research Office of the Ministry of Communications, Fu Guomin

	The development history of the world's transportation industry shows that although water and rail transport developed earlier, road transport, which emerged later, has developed at an astonishing speed, far surpassing the former and other modes of transport. The development trajectory and situation of road transport in China are consistent with the development trends of various countries in the world, and passenger transport is particularly prominent. From 1950 to 1985, the proportion of passenger volume in China's road transport increased from 11.3% to 75.2%, and the passenger turnover volume increased from 5.4% to 36.7%.

	The development of contemporary science and technology has injected new vitality into the development of road transport. The demand for the safe, rapid, and timely transportation of small batches of raw materials and products is increasing. According to relevant departments, by the end of this century, the proportion of road passenger and freight volume in China's total social volume is expected to reach 79.7%—81.2% for freight and 87%—88.3% for passengers. Road transport has unique advantages that other modes of transport cannot replace in promoting China's economic development and changing the backward situation in old, young, border, and poor regions.

　　公路运输有独特优势
　　交通部政策研究室副主任　傅国民
    世界交通业的发展历程表明，虽然水路、铁路运输发展在先，公路运输问世于后，但后者的发展速度却迅猛异常，大大超过了前者和其它运输方式。我国公路运输发展历程和态势与世界各国的发展趋势大体一致，且旅客运输尤为突出。从1950年到1985年，我国公路客运量比重从11.3％上升到75.2％，旅客周转量从5.4％上升到36.7％。
    当代科学技术的发展，给公路运输的发展注入了新的活力，小批量的原材料和产品运输迅速增加，要求提供安全、迅速、及时的运输服务。据有关部门预测，到本世纪末，我国公路客、货运量占社会总运量的比重，货运量将达到79.7％—81.2％，客运量将达到87％
  —88.3％。公路运输对促进我国经济发展，改变老、少、边、穷地区落后面貌，有着其它运输方式不可取代的优势。
