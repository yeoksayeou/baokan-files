	The Hope of Underachieving Students

	Recently, due to work, I have had the opportunity to interact with some underachieving students and understand their difficulties.

	A student in my school who has poor academic performance told me that catching up to the top students would undoubtedly require a lot of hard work. She hoped to receive help from teachers, but the teachers looked at her with disappointment. In class, the teachers' smiles were always directed at the top students. When answering questions or doing exercises on the blackboard, they always called on the high-achieving students, paying no attention to those who were struggling. During evening self-study, when teachers came to the classroom for tutoring, underachieving students asked questions they didn't understand, but the teachers coldly replied, "Even such simple things you don't understand, why are you still studying?" After saying this, they turned and walked towards the "top students."

	A student from the third year of Nèixī Middle School wrote in their diary: "Teacher, we are already middle school students and understand some principles. Why can't this underachieving student receive your warm guidance, but only see a cold face? Teacher, if you were in my situation, how would you feel? Please, give us underachieving students a little love!"

### 后进学生的盼望

　　后进学生的盼望
    最近，因工作关系，我接触到一些后进学生，了解了他们的一些苦衷。
    我校一个学习成绩不好的学生对我说，她要追赶上优等生，无疑要经过一番艰苦的努力，盼望能得到老师的帮助，但老师却向她投来失望的目光。在课堂上，老师的笑脸总是向着优等生，回答问题、上黑板做练习也总是叫成绩好的，对成绩差的则不屑一顾。晚自习老师下班里辅导，后进学生提出不懂的问题，老师竟冷冷地回答：“连这么简单的都不会，还读什么书？”说完便转身走向“优等生”。
    内溪中学一位初三学生在日记中写道：“老师啊，我们已是中学生了，懂得了一些道理，我这差等生为什么就得不到您的亲切教诲，而看到的总是冷冰冰的面孔？老师，如果您处于我这种情况，您的心情将如何？求求您，分给我们差生一点爱吧！”
