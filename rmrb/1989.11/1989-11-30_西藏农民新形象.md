Tibet has three eighty-percents: 80% of the population lives in agricultural and pastoral areas; 80% of the population is illiterate; and 80% of the social output value comes from agriculture and animal husbandry.

The development of Tibet's economy hinges on the revitalization of agriculture and animal husbandry.

After 1980, due to the central government's policy of rest and recovery in Tibet, land was allocated to households for use, livestock was privately owned and raised, and self-managed operations were maintained for the long term. Tibetan farmers began to embark on the path to poverty alleviation and prosperity.

In the well-developed and well-informed pastoral areas, Tibetan farmers are striding towards modernization.

On the banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River in Shannan, Tibet, 45-year-old Gamar Sangzhu from Jiesha Village is the first in the area to achieve mechanization of agriculture and electrification of households. In 1982, he contracted 15.5 mu of land. Due to his emphasis on agricultural technology, his grain yield per mu reached 600 kilograms, the highest in the county. His family of four has sold nearly 20,000 kilograms of surplus grain to the state over seven years. This family has prospered through farming, successively purchasing a walk-behind tractor, a small harvester, a seeder, a thresher, and a winnower, and they also have a flour mill at home.

Gamar, the current party branch secretary of the Jiesha Residents' Committee, is a national labor model. He sighed deeply to the reporter, "I am of serf origin. Without the Communist Party, I would not be able to freely till my own land today." He then talked about his next goal: "We farmers have too many illiterates, and our farm machinery is aging, technology also needs to be updated. The next generation cannot farm like me relying on experience; they must have knowledge."

In the four villages of the Jiesha Residents' Committee, 20% of the families send their children to study in Tibetan middle schools in inland China, and the illiteracy rate is shrinking. Gamar hopes his children can complete their university education.

The reporter recalled a visit to several counties in eastern Tibet two years ago. At that time, some rural farmers, after contracting land, quickly had a lot of cash in hand. But they did not use it to develop production; instead, they traveled thousands of miles to worship Buddha or spent tens of thousands of yuan to build family chapels. Now, all this is beginning to change.

Nima Yuzhu from the village of Jianxiong in Shigatse has a family of twelve people who contracted over 50 mu of land. So far, they have sold over 50,000 kilograms of commercial grain to the state. His family farm has, in the past two years, developed from a single agricultural system to a diversified one: the livestock pen has over 120 cattle and sheep; family members are divided into carpentry, masonry, tailoring, and tractor transportation, and they also contracted the village's water mill, purchased an oil press and flour mill, and set up a workshop. Nima talked about the situation before 1980, when the family had only about a dozen cattle and sheep, relying on work points to earn a living, and every year they could not eat their fill. Now, however, they have built a two-story house with thirty rooms.

In the forest region of Bomê County, the Qizuma family farm by the Sichuan-Tibet Highway is famous far and wide. He contracted over 200 mu of land and became the county's largest grain producer. In this farm, modern agricultural machinery is almost complete, and farmers who used to plow with wooden plows and oxen are now skillfully operating large tractors or harvesters in fertile fields.

According to data provided by the Tibet Agricultural Commission, over the past thirty years, Tibet has purchased a total of over 130 large, medium, and small tractors; over 5,000 harvesters and threshers. In recent years, Tibet's farmers' income has increased year by year, and individuals have successively purchased over 1,000 agricultural machinery, replacing some manual labor with machinery, and Tibet's farmers have begun to embark on the path of agricultural mechanization.

In the 38 years since Tibet's peaceful liberation, agricultural tools have undergone a transformation from wooden plows and iron tools to agricultural machinery; in terms of production organization, they have gone through three stages from serfdom with no personal freedom to collectivization, communalization, and contracting land for self-management; and their concepts have also changed accordingly.

Recently, the reporter conducted an interview in Gyangzê and deeply felt the great role of the grassroots party organizations in organizing agricultural production, and the emphasis on agricultural technology has made people take a new look at backward Tibetan agriculture. Lu Shisheng, deputy secretary of the Gyangzê County Committee, introduced: The county's agricultural seed sowing, mechanized plowing and sowing, and fertilizer use area have all reached over 80%.

A few years ago, it was difficult to promote agricultural technology in Tibet's agricultural areas. When Gyangzê first promoted pesticides, some farmers secretly poured the pesticides into ditches. Once, when they encountered a pest disaster, the farmers did not want to "kill living things" and invited lamas to chant scriptures to dispel the disaster, watching helplessly as locusts swarmed the sky, while the neighboring fields, with the help of agricultural technicians, used pesticides. By the harvest season, the fields that thought chanting scriptures could dispel the disaster were withered and barren, while the neighboring fields had a bumper harvest. Facts educated the farmers, and only by promoting agricultural technology could there be a bumper harvest. County Party Secretary Pingcuo personally contracted a family test field, and every link from sowing to harvesting was guided by agricultural technicians, resulting in a yield of over 400 kilograms per mu. Pingcuo invited village cadres to observe and explain the benefits of agricultural technology on the spot. Now, Gyangzê has a county agricultural technology promotion center, each township has an agricultural technology promotion station, and each village has a farming expert serving as an agricultural technology promoter. This year, the county's 17 townships, guaranteed by the county party committee and government, have implemented agricultural technology measures to the field, making a county with a population of 50,000 achieve a grain output of 45 million kilograms.

Lu Shisheng told the reporter with a smile, "In the past, farmers did not want to use fertilizer, let alone use it scientifically. Now, if there is no fertilizer, farmers would probably quarrel."

　　西藏农民新形象
　　本报记者　刘伟
    西藏有三个百分之八十：农牧区人口占全藏总人口百分之八十；全藏总人口中文盲占百分之八十；自治区社会总产值中农牧业占百分之八十。
    西藏经济要发展，农牧业的振兴是关键。
    一九八○年以后，由于中央在藏实行休养生息政策，土地归户使用，牲畜私有私养、自主经营长期不变。西藏农民开始走上脱贫致富之路。
    在交通发达、信息灵通的牧区，藏族农民在向现代化迈进。
    西藏山南的雅鲁藏布江边，结沙村四十五岁的嘎玛桑珠在当地率先实现农作机械化和家庭电气化。一九八二年承包十五点五亩地，由于重视农业科技，粮食年亩产达六百公斤，居全县之首。一家四口人，七年向国家交售余粮近两万公斤。这家子务农致富，先后购置了手扶拖拉机、小型收割机、播种机、脱粒机、扬场机，屋里还有磨面机。
    结沙居委会现任党支部书记嘎玛是全国劳模。他无限感慨地对记者说：“我是农奴出身，没有共产党，今天不可能自由地耕种自己的田地。”接着又谈起他下一步的目标：我们农民文盲太多，农机已在老化，技术也需更新。下一代不能像我凭经验种地，一定得有知识了。”
    结沙居委会四个村子，有百分之二十的农家送子女去了内地的西藏中学就读，文盲比例正在缩小，嘎玛希望他的孩子能够读完大学。
    记者想起两年前在西藏东部几个县采访的事。当时一些乡村农民在承包土地后，手里很快有了大把的钞票。但他们不是用来发展生产，而是千里迢迢去朝佛，或者花上万元盖家庭经堂。现在，这一切开始发生变化。
    日喀则边雄乡的尼玛欧珠，全家十二口人承包五十多亩地，至今已向国家交售五万多公斤商品粮。他的家庭农场，近两年由单一农耕向多元体系发展：畜圈有一百二十多头牛羊；家人分工干木匠、石匠、裁缝和拖拉机运输，还承包了村里的水磨，购置了榨油机、磨面机，办起了作坊。尼玛谈起一九八○年以前，家里只有十来头牛羊，靠挣工分，年年食不饱腹，现在却盖起了有三十间房的两层楼。
    在森林地区的波密县，地处川藏公路旁的启珠玛家庭农场远近闻名。他承包二百余亩土地，成为县里的种粮大户。在这农场里，现代农业机械几乎样样俱全，数年前还是踩木犁赶耗牛耕作的农民，如今在肥沃的田地熟练地操纵着大型拖拉机或收割机。
    据西藏农委提供的资料，西藏三十多年来累计购进大中小型拖拉机一百三十多台；收割机、脱粒机五千多台。近年来，西藏农民收入逐年增加，仅是个人就先后购买农机具一千多台，一些手工劳作为机械所替代，西藏农民开始走上农业机械化道路。
    西藏和平解放至今三十八年间，在农业工具上经历了木犁、铁器到农机的变迁；在生产组织上经历了从没有人身自由的农奴到合作化、公社化、承包土地自主经营三个阶段；观念上也随着发生了变化。
    最近记者在江孜采访，深深感到基层党组织在组织农业生产上发挥的巨大作用，重视农业科技使人对落后的西藏农业刮目相看。江孜县委副书记陆世生介绍：全县农业良种播种、机耕机播、化肥使用面积均已达百分之八十以上。
    前几年西藏农区推行农业科技有困难。江孜刚开始推广农药，一些农民将农药悄悄倒进水沟。有一次遇上虫灾，农民不愿“杀生”，请来喇嘛在地头念经消灾，眼睁睁看着漫天蝗虫飞舞，而相邻农田在农技人员帮助下使用了农药。到秋收季节，以为念经可以消灾的田地一片凋零枯败，邻田却获得丰收。事实教育了农民，大兴农业科技才能有丰收。县委书记平措还亲自承包一块家庭试验田，从播种到收割每一环节由农技人员指导，结果亩产达到四百多公斤。平措让乡村干部来观摩，实地讲解农业科技的好处。现在江孜已有县农技推广中心，每个乡有农技推广站，村村有种田能手充当的农技推广员。今年该县十七个乡镇，由县委和县政府包干，抓农技的保证措施到地头，使一个有五万人口的县粮食产量达到四千五百万公斤。
    陆世生笑着告诉记者，昔日农民有化肥不愿意用，更不会科学使用，现在如果没有化肥，农民怕是要吵翻天哟。
