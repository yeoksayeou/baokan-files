Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 6th — “China has its own Adidas!” Sports enthusiasts from various regions who visited the "International Fashion Flashlight Pile Sportswear Exhibition" held by the Shanghai Knitting Factory all exclaimed in excitement.

“Adidas” is a famous sportswear brand from West Germany that has gained worldwide popularity. In recent years, it has entered coastal cities in China and has been favored by athletes and young people. Unfortunately, it is expensive, selling for 200 to 300 yuan per set in the Shanghai market, making it unaffordable for many who can only admire it from afar.

The Shanghai Knitting Factory was the first in the country to develop flashlight pile sportswear. It uses top-grade polyester elastic yarn as raw material, weaves it with a warp-knitting machine, and then dyes, piles, and sets the fabric. The resulting fabric is soft and smooth to the touch, durable, and does not wrinkle easily. The colors are bright and vibrant, and do not fade. Compared to the fabric of Adidas sportswear, it is not inferior. It can compete with world-famous sportswear brands, and its price is only about one-third of that, making it suitable for the Chinese consumption level. It can be used as sportswear, travel wear, and casual wear.

    上海运动服追赶——
    世界名牌“阿迪达斯”
    据新华社上海十一月六日电　（记者吴复民）“中国有了自己的阿迪达斯！”参观了上海针织厂举办的“国际风行闪光起绒运动服展示会”的各地体育行家，都兴奋地发出赞叹。
    “阿迪达斯”是联邦德国风靡世界的名牌运动服，近年来进入中国沿海城市，深得运动员和青年人的青睐。可惜价格昂贵，在上海市场卖到了二三百元一套，许多人只能望运动“服”而兴叹。
    上海针织厂在国内最先开发的闪光起绒运动服，选用世界一流的涤纶弹力丝作原料，用经编机织造，再经过染色、起绒、定型。这样生产出的面料手感柔软、滑爽，耐磨而不起绉折，色彩光亮、鲜艳，不褪色，同“阿迪达斯”运动服面料相比并不逊色。它能与世界名牌运动服媲美，而价格只有其三分之一左右，符合中国人消费水平，可作运动服、旅游服、休闲服。
