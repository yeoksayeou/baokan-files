A red carpet was laid in the center of the square. Over a thousand girls in colorful dresses danced and sang along the path leading to the square, holding flowers.

As Premier Li Peng and his wife walked up the red carpet towards the stage, the crowd on both sides showered them with flower petals in welcome. After Premier Li and his wife took their seats on the stage, accompanied by President Ershad and his wife, hundreds of colorful balloons soared into the sky, and over a hundred doves flew from the stage into the sky.

Mayor Rahman, in his welcome speech, said, "The long-standing friendship between the peoples of China and Bangladesh has bound the two countries in a strong bond of friendship, unity, and mutual respect."

He said, "Premier Li's visit will further strengthen the close and friendly relations that already exist between the two countries and their peoples."

Premier Li, in his speech, highly praised the great achievements of the Bangladeshi government and people in maintaining national independence and sovereignty, developing the national economy, and overcoming natural disasters.

During the reception, Mayor Rahman presented Premier Li with a golden key to the city of Dhaka, encased in a silver box. Then, the mayor's wife presented Mrs. Li with a specially made traditional Bangladeshi women's garment, a sari.
