A Dalian individual taxi driver, Sun Shènglì, found a large sum of money and returned it to the Japanese owner, earning praise from Japanese friends.

On the evening of September 16, around 10 PM, Sun Shènglì picked up three Japanese passengers and drove them to the Kyushu Hotel in Dalian. The next morning, he discovered a briefcase on the back seat of his car containing 60,000 yen, as well as some US dollars, foreign exchange certificates, Chinese yuan, and passports. Sun Shènglì realized that these items must have been left behind by the three Japanese passengers the previous night. He immediately drove back to the Kyushu Hotel, found the owners, and returned the money and items to them.

    据新华社大连11月8日电　（通讯员王永海、记者李小林）大连个体出租车司机孙胜利拾到巨款交还日本失主，受到日本朋友的称赞。
    9月16日晚10时许，孙胜利载3位日本客人到大连九州饭店。第二天一早，孙胜利发现车后座垫上有一个公文包里，面装有6万日元，还有一些美元、外汇兑换券、人民币和护照等物品。孙胜利想一定是那3位日本客人昨晚乘车后忘在车上的，于是，他急忙驾车赶到九州饭店，找到失主，把钱和物品交给了他们。
