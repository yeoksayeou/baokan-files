Lebanese President Muwaad has decided to appoint Salim Hoss as the Prime Minister of Lebanon and has tasked him with forming a national unity government.

Our correspondent Lü Zhixing reported from Damascus on November 13: Today at noon, the political advisor to the Lebanese President announced a statement saying that Lebanese President Muwaad has appointed Salim Hoss as the Prime Minister of Lebanon and has entrusted him with the task of forming a national unity government.

This announcement came after President Muwaad held nearly an hour-long meeting with Hoss. Earlier, in accordance with the Taif Agreement, President Muwaad and Speaker of the Parliament Hussein had a meeting and consultations.

Local analysts believe that with Hoss forming the cabinet, pro-Syrian Lebanese Muslim leaders such as Jumblatt and Berri are more willing to join the new government. Whether the Christian factions will join the cabinet will depend on Oron's stance. The leader of the "Lebanese Forces," Geagea, has announced his support for Oron. The leader of the Phalange Party has stated that the most important thing at the moment is to maintain the unity of the Christian factions.

    黎巴嫩总统穆瓦德决定
    任命萨利姆·胡斯为总理
    本报大马士革11月13日电  记者吕志星报道：今天中午，黎巴嫩总统政治顾问宣布一项公报说，黎巴嫩总统穆瓦德任命萨利姆·胡斯为黎巴嫩总理，并委托他组织全国统一政府。
    这项公报是在穆瓦德总统同胡斯举行了近1小时的会谈后宣布的。此前根据塔伊夫协议规定，穆瓦德总统和侯赛尼议长进行了会晤和磋商。
    当地人士分析，由于胡斯组阁，亲叙利亚的黎穆斯林教派领导人琼卜拉特和贝里等较愿意参加新政府，而基督教派是否入阁，将取决于奥恩的态度。“黎巴嫩力量”领导人盖亚盖亚宣布站在奥恩一边。长枪党领导人则表示，目前最重要的是维护基督教派的团结。
