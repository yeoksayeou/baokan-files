The Nicaraguan government announced on November 1 that it would suspend its unilateral ceasefire until a "ceasefire" is achieved and the anti-government rebels based in Honduras are "systematically disbanded."

President Daniel Ortega, speaking at a press conference at the presidential palace on the issue of suspending the ceasefire, pointed out that in the past 20 days, more than 1,100 anti-government rebels had taken advantage of the government's unilateral ceasefire and U.S. "humanitarian" aid to infiltrate the country, killing civilians and attacking economic and military targets. He said that the government had reached a point of "intolerable" frustration.

Ortega called on the U.S. government to support the Central American peace agreement. He demanded that a meeting be held at the United Nations headquarters on November 6 and 7, with representatives from the governments of Honduras and Nicaragua, representatives from the International Support and Verification Committee, and representatives from the Nicaraguan anti-government rebels to discuss the technical issues of the rebels returning to the country to participate in political activities or settling in a third country.

The Nicaraguan government's decision to suspend the unilateral ceasefire was criticized by domestic opposition parties and the church. The leader of the National Opposition Union pointed out that "there are no military reasons for the government to suspend the ceasefire."

According to reports, UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar expressed "great concern" today over the Nicaraguan government's suspension of the ceasefire. He urged both sides in Nicaragua to exercise restraint and resume the ceasefire.

Venezuelan Foreign Minister Reinaldo Figueredo today expressed regret over the Nicaraguan government's suspension of the ceasefire. He said that Venezuela would continue to mediate between the Nicaraguan government and other countries "to resolve the issues to the satisfaction of all parties."

    尼加拉瓜政府宣布
    中止单方面停火
    新华社马那瓜11月1日电  （记者宋心德）尼加拉瓜政府1日正式宣布中止单方面停火，直至“停战”和驻扎在洪都拉斯境内的尼反政府武装“有计划地遣散”。
    奥尔特加总统就中止停火问题今天在总统府举行的记者招待会上指出，最近20天来，1100余名反政府武装分子利用政府单方面停火的机会和美国的“人道主义”援助，潜入尼内地杀害平民，并袭击经济和军事目标。他说，政府方面已到了忍无可忍的地步。
    奥尔特加呼吁美国政府支持中美洲和平协议。他要求11月6日至7日在联合国总部举行有洪都拉斯和尼加拉瓜两国政府代表、国际支持与核查委员会代表和尼反政府武装代表参加的会议，讨论尼反政府武装分子回国参加政治活动或者到第三国定居的技术问题。
    尼政府中止单方面停火的决定遭到国内反对党和教会方面的批评。全国反对派联盟的领导人指出，“不存在军事方面的原因而致使政府中止停火”。
    据悉，联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔今天对尼加拉瓜政府中止停火感到“非常不安”。他要求尼双方采取克制态度，恢复停火。
    委内瑞拉外交部长费格雷多今天对尼政府中止停火表示遗憾。
    他说，委内瑞拉将继续在尼加拉瓜政府和其它一些国家之间进行斡旋，“以使各方面的问题得到令人满意的解决”。
