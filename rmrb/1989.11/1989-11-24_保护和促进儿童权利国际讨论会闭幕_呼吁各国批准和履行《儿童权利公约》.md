Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 23rd.

The international conference on protecting and promoting children's rights concluded today. Representatives from 13 countries and regions called for effective and concrete measures to increase financial, human, and technological investments to ensure that children's political, economic, and cultural educational rights are adequately guaranteed and developed.

It is estimated that children make up more than one-third of the world's population. In China, with a population of 1.1 billion, there are over 300 million children under the age of 11. Experts pointed out that even today, 30% of the world's children live in poverty, and every year, 13 million children under the age of five die.

Participants also called on all social organizations, academic institutions, businesses, welfare agencies, and all good-hearted individuals around the world to enthusiastically support, protect, and promote the cause of children's rights. They urged all member states of the United Nations to sign and ratify the recently unanimously adopted "Convention on the Rights of the Child" by the General Assembly, making it a universally binding international law. They also called for the fulfillment of the obligations stipulated in the Convention and support for international activities to defend children's rights.
