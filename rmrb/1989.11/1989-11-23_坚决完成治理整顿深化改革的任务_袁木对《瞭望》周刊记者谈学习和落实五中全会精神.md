In the midst of the nation's deep study and earnest implementation of the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, Comrade Yuan Mu, spokesperson of the State Council, based on his personal study experience, answered questions posed by reporters from the *Outlook Weekly* regarding how to study and implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session.

The situation in China is stable, and the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core is effective and popular.

Q: Correctly analyzing and understanding the situation is the ideological foundation for deeply grasping the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session. What is your view on the current situation in China?

A: From the suppression of the turmoil and the quelling of the counter-revolutionary rebellion to now, only five and a half months have passed. Our Party has led the people of the whole country to properly handle this heart-wrenching and serious political struggle, quickly stabilizing the situation across the country. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee solved urgent political and organizational issues, established the Central Leadership Collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, took a series of measures, and did a lot of work. From an overall perspective, it is deeply popular. In the face of Western imperialism's continued implementation of the "peaceful evolution" strategy against socialist countries and the successive serious setbacks in the international socialist cause, China's situation is stable, policies are stable, and people's hearts are stable. This has withstood the international anti-communist tide and continued to advance along the socialist path. This is significant and far-reaching, both in the short term and in the long term. This is the mainstream of China's situation and also the basic starting point for our observation of the situation.

More than five months of practice have shown that our Party is united, strong, and capable of withstanding tests, and our people are united, strong, and capable of withstanding tests. The measures taken by the Party and the government to suppress the turmoil and quell the rebellion have increasingly gained the support of the vast majority of the people. This fully shows that in this vast land of China, the Party's leadership and socialism are deeply rooted in people's hearts. This is the most basic fact in China. Without this most basic fact, China's situation could not have changed so soon after experiencing such a violent shock, in a way that is in line with the hearts of the Party and the people.

More than five months of practice have also shown that the work of the new leadership collective established by the Fourth Plenary Session, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, is effective. For example: In politics, the Party's basic line of "one center, two basic points" is fully and resolutely implemented, changing the previous situation of "one hand soft, one hand hard"; In the Party's ideological and organizational work, national propaganda and organizational work conferences have been successively held, correcting the previous mistakes of weakening the Party's leadership, neglecting ideological and political work, and neglecting Party building. Of course, it cannot be said that all the problems in this aspect have been solved, but the Central Committee has made up its mind to gradually solve the problems that everyone is eager to solve. The Communist Party of China is the ruling party, and the state of the Party determines the destiny and future of China. The Central Committee has clearly stated that the main problems in the past mistakes in China lie within the Party, and solving problems must start from within the Party. This way of proposing and understanding problems fully demonstrates the Party's Marxist boldness and courage. Propaganda work has corrected its direction, adhering to Marxism as guidance, and the serious spread of bourgeois liberalization in the previous period, which flooded the public opinion field, has been fundamentally changed. The struggle against pornography, which is related to purifying the social environment and cleansing people's minds, is also very popular. In terms of clean governance, the seven things that the Party Central Committee has proposed to do well reflect two distinct features: first, starting from the leadership; second, focusing on concrete work and not making empty promises. Of course, it cannot be said that what has been done so far is enough, and there is still a lot of work to be done in clean governance, but at least a good start has been made. Many problems that have accumulated over the past few years, especially those that were used by people with ulterior motives to attack the Party and the government during the turmoil, are now beginning to be solved or are in the process of being solved. The general public reflects that now people's grievances have lessened a bit, complaints have reduced a bit, smiles have increased a bit, and trust in the Party and the government is gradually strengthening. This should probably be said to be a true reflection of the actual situation. While striving to maintain a stable and united political situation, although the turmoil and rebellion have brought us huge losses, the overall national economy is still developing in the process of rectification and adjustment. In terms of diplomatic work, it should be said that we are facing a quite severe situation. The Central Committee's policy is to adhere to principles, do more work, and resolutely withstand various external pressures to interfere in China's internal affairs. More and more facts show that anyone who wants to isolate China in the international arena will not succeed and will not be possible. China's cause will continue to receive the support of the vast majority of countries and peoples in the world.

In summary, more than five months of practice has shown that socialist China, with a population of 1.1 billion, still stands firmly in the East, presenting to the people of the world the image of a socialist country that is reforming and opening up and thriving.

Correctly understanding the current economic situation requires both fully affirming achievements and realistically assessing difficulties.

Q: The current economic situation is a concern for everyone, and opinions vary. Could you please talk about how to correctly view the current economic situation?

A: Before talking about the economic situation, I first mentioned the overall situation in China to you, hoping that everyone can observe China's economic problems in such a background. This way, we can better grasp the situation and better understand the significance of the Fifth Plenary Session's focus on discussing and solving economic problems.

As for the economic situation itself, the first thing to see is that the achievements of the past 10 years of construction and reform and opening up are enormous, which is a fact recognized by the world. Over the past 10 years, China's gross national product has increased by 1.51 times in comparable prices, with an average annual growth rate of 9.6%; the average annual living expenses of urban residents have increased from 316 yuan to 1119 yuan, and the average net income of farmers has increased from 134 yuan to 545 yuan, an increase of 411 yuan in 10 years. In contrast, from 1949 to 1978, over 29 years, the average net income of farmers increased by only 90 yuan. The basic problem of food and clothing for the people of the whole country has been solved, and the number of poor households in rural areas has been greatly reduced. China's foreign trade and economic and technological exchanges have rapidly expanded, with a significant increase in total foreign trade and continuous improvement in the structure of imports and exports. There are many more facts and figures that can be listed, all of which show that the achievements of the 10 years of reform and opening up are enormous, with historical changes that have never occurred in any previous period. This is an objective fact and the result of implementing the Party's basic line of "one center, two basic points."

While fully affirming the achievements, we should realistically assess the problems and difficulties we face. These problems and difficulties are not sudden occurrences of the past one or two years but have been accumulating since the second half of 1984. An important reason for the emergence of problems and difficulties is the impatience in thought, detachment from national conditions, exceeding national strength, overlarge scale of construction, and overly fast development speed. Since the second half of 1984, the economy has overheated, with fiscal deficits year after year, excessive currency issuance, and imbalances in the national economy. Agriculture has stagnated, processing industries have developed too fast, and there is a shortage of energy, raw materials, and transportation. At the same time, in recent years, the proportion of national income accounted for by fiscal revenue has decreased, and the proportion of national fiscal revenue accounted for by central fiscal revenue has decreased, weakening the macro-control capability. The emphasis on activating the micro-economy in the past few years is correct and should be fully affirmed, but the weakening of macro-control capability is very unfavorable for the overall economy. During the rectification and adjustment, macro-control should be strengthened, and necessary and appropriate centralization and unification should be strengthened.

Currently, in the understanding of the economic situation, two points are particularly worth noting: first, the difficulties are underestimated, and thus the necessity, complexity, and arduousness of rectification and adjustment are not recognized; second, the difficulties are overestimated, and thus a sense of difficulty arises, even losing confidence. Difficulties should be analyzed concretely. In terms of the severity of the current difficulties, compared with the difficulties we have encountered in history, such as those in the early 1960s and during the "Cultural Revolution," they are undoubtedly much smaller. In terms of the conditions for overcoming difficulties, there are both better and worse aspects compared to the past, but overall, the better aspects are more. First, after 10 years of reform and opening up, the national economic strength has been greatly enhanced, and people's lives have improved significantly, providing much more room for maneuver to overcome difficulties compared to the past; second, after one year of rectification and adjustment, some achievements have been made, and some experience has been accumulated, providing a good start; third, after the recent turmoil, everyone's mind is clearer, and the direction of adhering to socialism is seen more clearly, and people's confidence in the Central Committee has increased. Therefore, we have every condition to overcome the temporary difficulties that have emerged in the process of advancement and have no reason to lose confidence.

Q: More than a year of rectification and adjustment has also achieved results. What are the main aspects?

A: First, the inflation rate has been somewhat curbed. Although prices have risen this year, the rate of increase in retail prices for the whole society has been decreasing month by month since the beginning of the year. Compared with the same period last year, the rate of increase was 26% at the beginning of the year and has now dropped to around 12%. In this overall index, the rate of increase in the prices of the more than forty kinds of necessities of life determined by the State Council is much smaller than the overall rate of increase. According to observations, the public's mood towards the market situation is basically stable. Second, the excessively high economic growth rate has been reduced, with a decrease of about 50 billion yuan in fixed asset investment compared to last year; the growth of consumption funds, although not yet reduced to the expected level, has also been controlled. Third, the situation of agricultural production this year is still good, with summer grain production reaching a historical high, and the total autumn grain production is generally higher than last year. Fourth, the situation of currency withdrawal is good, with savings increasing significantly, reaching an increase of 100 billion yuan so far, and it is expected to reach around 120 billion yuan by the end of the year. Of course, everyone is enthusiastic about savings, and holding money for selection or even hoarding money without buying is also an important factor in the market's sluggishness to some extent. Overall, the effects of rectification and adjustment, although still preliminary, must be fully affirmed.

Some new situations have also emerged during the rectification and adjustment. Currently, the most prominent issue is the sluggish market sales, with some enterprises facing product backlogs and a sharp decline in industrial growth rates. How should we view this problem? First, we should see that generally, this is a phenomenon that is difficult to completely avoid in the process of rectification and adjustment. We must not be shaken by this and relax the policy of tightening fiscal and financial matters as a whole. At the same time, we should also take necessary and flexible measures at the macro level to alleviate the financial difficulties of some enterprises and some aspects. The State Council has decided to gradually increase the issuance of loans, which has already started in October and will continue to increase in November and December. For enterprises, in the past, demand was too strong, and any product could be sold, whether it was improving product quality, product updates and replacements, or adjusting industrial and product structures, there was a lack of pressure and motivation. The situation is different now. The market is sluggish, and many products are backlogged. Enterprises should use this opportunity to vigorously adjust structures, improve technological levels, improve product quality, and improve economic benefits. From a long-term and fundamental perspective, this is not a bad thing but a good thing for the development of China's economy.

The analysis and understanding of the current economic situation should adopt a cautious attitude. On the one hand, we must not hastily abandon the tight fiscal policy because of the emergence of some new problems; on the other hand, we should also take necessary measures based on the actual situation. As long as we maintain a clear mind, respond calmly, and take effective measures, the current temporary difficulties can be overcome, and rectification and adjustment will definitely be successful.

Rectification and adjustment and deepening reform are dialectically unified, and it is wrong to oppose the two.

Q: Some people have a vague understanding of the relationship between rectification and adjustment and deepening reform, believing that rectification and adjustment is a halt or even a retreat of reform. Can you talk about the relationship between the two?

A: This understanding is a misunderstanding of the Central Committee's policy on rectification and adjustment and deepening reform. In the previous stage of economic work, some practices violated objective economic laws, leading to total imbalance, structural imbalance, inflation, and economic disorder. These problems must be solved for the economy to achieve stable growth. The purpose of rectification and adjustment is to get China's economy out of the predicament and achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated development. Therefore, rectification and adjustment is unavoidable and is an indispensable stage in the development of China's economy.

How to carry out rectification and adjustment? The Fifth Plenary Session summarized the experience of a year of rectification and adjustment, basically grasped the laws, and based on this, determined the main links of rectification and adjustment work, which can be summarized in four sentences of sixteen characters: compress demand, adjust structure, rectify order, and improve efficiency.

Deepening reform is also unavoidable. China will firmly walk the socialist path, which no one can change. And for socialism to develop, it must carry out reform and opening up. Without reform and opening up, socialism will not have vitality, and its inherent advantages will not be brought into play, and it will not be attractive, and the corresponding bourgeois liberalization ideology will have a market. We must stand on this basic point to consider all problems. Reform is the driving force for perfecting and developing the socialist system and is an irreversible historical trend. We must, on the premise of adhering to the four cardinal principles, proceed from China's national conditions and continuously deepen reform. All reform measures that are conducive to the development of social productive forces should be continued and constantly improved.

In the specific handling of the relationship between rectification and adjustment and deepening reform, three points must be made clear: first, rectification and adjustment is not to abandon reform, and many of its measures cannot be implemented solely through administrative commands but must rely on the coordination of reform measures; second, the achievements of rectification and adjustment will create more favorable conditions for the further deepening and improvement of reform. Doing a good job in rectification and adjustment is an indispensable condition for deepening reform. In the face of total imbalance, structural imbalance, and inflation, many reform measures cannot be implemented. Economic disorder, with too many and chaotic companies, if not cleaned up and rectified, the reform measures to invigorate the economy will not only fail to achieve their goals but may even have the opposite effect; third, whether it is rectification and adjustment or deepening reform, they themselves are not goals but means. We cannot carry out rectification and adjustment for the sake of rectification and adjustment, nor can we deepen reform for the sake of deepening reform. They are all for promoting China's socialist modernization economic construction. Therefore, during the period of rectification and adjustment, we must overcome the wrong understanding and behavior of opposing rectification and adjustment and deepening reform.

In the next three years or more, the main task is rectification and adjustment, and reform should be carried out around this center. The measures for rectification and adjustment and deepening reform should be specifically implemented in the national plan for each year. The planning conference to be held in early December will specifically implement the tasks of rectification and adjustment and various reform measures for next year.

During the period of rectification and adjustment, all regions, units, organizations, especially enterprises, must strive to carry out production and savings, income and expenditure reduction campaigns, mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, and deeply carry out socialist labor competitions.

Whether during the period of rectification and adjustment or after the completion of the rectification and adjustment tasks, we must not advocate the so-called "big leap forward" that is detached from national conditions and strength, and we must adhere to the guiding principle of long-term, sustained, stable, and coordinated development.

Q: Since the founding of the country, China's economy has undergone several major adjustments. The problems in each adjustment were almost all caused by overheating of the economy. So, what is the root cause of the overheating of the economy?

A: This Central Committee plenary session deeply summarized the most important lesson from the past 40 years of China's economic work, which is that economic development must not be rushed, and there must be no ups and downs. If one-sidedly pursues high speed, it seems to develop quickly and superficially prosperous, but in the end, it will fall back and is not a blessing for the people. The development of social productive forces is a long-term, gradual, and cumulative process. Only on a stable basis and in a balanced, proportional, and coordinated manner can significant progress be made. Total imbalance, structural imbalance, and ups and downs not only cannot effectively accumulate productive forces but often cause huge losses. The past "overheating-adjustment-overheating-adjustment" vicious cycle inevitably causes great damage to productive forces. The Fifth Plenary Session summarized historical experience and clearly proposed that construction, reform, and rectification and adjustment must not be rushed. Whether during the period of rectification and adjustment or after the completion of rectification and adjustment, we must not engage in the so-called "big leap forward" that is detached from national conditions and strength, and we must adhere to the principle of long-term, sustained, stable, and coordinated development. Sustainability means maintaining a reasonable development speed for a long time; stability means no ups and downs; coordination means planned and proportional development. These three are interrelated. Without a relatively long period of stable development, there can be no stability; with ups and downs, there can be no sustained development; if the proportions are disrupted, sustained and stable development are both impossible. This is the summary of the lessons learned over 40 years. The whole Party and the whole country must act according to this principle and persist in it unswervingly. As long as we adhere to this principle, maintain a reasonable speed, and develop in a planned and proportional manner, we will definitely be able to achieve the strategic goal of doubling the gross national product by the end of this century.

Q: The Central Committee proposed that we should tighten our belts for a few years during the period of rectification and adjustment. How should we understand this?

A: Advocating for a few years of tightening our belts, of course, all aspects must tighten fiscal spending and vigorously open up sources and save. However, this does not mean that the living standards of urban and rural residents will generally decline. In the past few years, the growth of consumption funds has been too fast, continuously exceeding the growth rate of national income and labor productivity, leading to high consumption and overconsumption, and also leading to an excessive tilt towards enterprises and individuals in national income distribution. From 1984 to 1988, China's national income increased by 70% (calculated at current prices, it increased by 149%), while the total fixed asset investment of the whole society increased by 214%, and the monetary income of urban and rural residents increased by 200%, actually resulting in the phenomenon of "eating the grain of the next year in this year." This situation has also corrupted social customs, raising the expenses of government agencies, organizations, and enterprises and units, and the wind of extravagance and waste has grown. This is not conducive to the development of the economy and society and has no benefits.

Now, advocating for a few years of tightening our belts is to curb the excessive expansion of consumption funds, curb high consumption and overconsumption, stop the wind of extravagance and waste, and correct the phenomenon of blindly pursuing so-called "modernization" in some living facilities, rather than to generally lower the living standards of the people.

Tightening our belts for a few years is not just a matter for the general public but should start with all government agencies, organizations, enterprises and units, and the broad cadre. Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the situation over the past few months has shown that the wind of feasting and gift-giving has been curbed. Of course, the situation in various places is not the same, with some better and some worse. But overall, it is beginning to turn for the better.

China's overall policy of opening up to the outside world will not change, and we will not yield to the economic sanctions imposed by Western countries. Temporary setbacks and difficulties can be overcome.

Q: Currently, Western countries are imposing economic sanctions on us, and China's economy is facing some temporary difficulties in its advancement. Facing this situation, some people lack confidence in moving forward. What do you think?

A: Some Western countries have imposed so-called economic sanctions on us, which are essentially political sanctions. We have suppressed the turmoil and quelled the rebellion, dealing a heavy blow to their strategy of "peaceful evolution" against our country. They are unwilling to accept defeat and use so-called economic sanctions to try to make China yield. This sanction will bring us temporary difficulties, but it is nothing to worry about. Some governments of Western countries, the business community of various countries, and many far-sighted individuals do not fully support this sanction. From the situation over the past few months, our foreign trade and economic relations are still developing, although they have been affected to a certain extent, the impact is not too great, and foreign investment in China is still increasing. Everything has two sides. On the one hand, the sanctions have increased some difficulties for us; on the other hand, they will also enhance our ability to rely on ourselves and arouse the spirit of self-reliance and hard work among the people. This is more meaningful to us. Overall, China's economic strength is continuously increasing, the domestic market is vast, and the people have the tradition of hard work and self-reliance. We have the confidence and ability to turn external pressure into motivation. Moreover, this sanction will also bring losses to the sanctioners themselves. The existence and development of China are a reality. China has a real and potential huge market, which is attractive. In my opinion, the so-called sanctions will eventually be lifted and cannot be sustained for a long time, although we do not expect this situation to end in the short term. We have never sought to achieve China's modernization through the charity of others but have always advocated that the starting point should be based on relying on our own strength. This does not mean closing the door to build the country, but we will continue to adhere to opening up to the outside world, make friends widely, and use all factors that can be used internationally to accelerate China's economic development. China's open door will never be closed again because this does not meet the requirements of China's modernization construction and the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the people.

Currently, China's outstanding foreign debt is 40 billion US dollars. Among them, there are short-term debts and long-term debts, with long-term debts being the majority; there are debts borrowed by the central government, and there are debts borrowed by local governments and enterprises, with debts borrowed by local governments and enterprises being the majority. It is estimated that the peak of debt repayment will be around 1990, with an annual repayment of about 70 to 80 billion US dollars. According to international conventions, although this situation is close to but has not yet reached the debt repayment alert line, China has always adhered to international credibility. We will definitely and completely have the ability to repay foreign debts.

Maintaining stability is the overriding task, with political stability as the premise and economic stability as the foundation, and the two are indispensable and mutually promoting.

Finally, Comrade Yuan Mu said to the reporter: Our country must continue to advance on the socialist path. The key at present is to maintain the overall stability of the country. Political stability is the premise, and economic stability is the foundation. The two are indispensable and mutually promoting. To this end, we must strive to maintain a stable and united political situation, resolutely implement the basic line and policies established since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and maintain the stability and continuity of policies, which is the premise for all work. Without the stability of the country, construction, reform, and rectification and adjustment will all be in vain. As long as we maintain the stability of the country's politics, economy, and society, the strategic goal of doubling the gross national product by the end of this century will definitely be achieved.

The above are some of my understandings of studying the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session. We firmly believe that as long as the whole country works together, relies on itself, and strives hard, we will definitely be able to overcome difficulties, achieve the goals proposed by the Fifth Plenary Session for rectification and adjustment, consolidate political stability and unity, and achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated economic development, and promote the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

    坚决完成治理整顿深化改革的任务
    ——袁木对《瞭望》周刊记者谈学习和落实五中全会精神
    在举国上下深入学习、认真贯彻党的十三届五中全会精神的时候，国务院发言人袁木同志根据他个人的学习体会，就如何学习和落实五中全会精神的问题，回答了《瞭望》周刊记者提出的问题。
      中国局势稳定，以江泽民
  同志为核心的党中央领导集体
  工作卓有成效，深得人心
    问：正确分析和认识形势是深入领会五中全会精神的思想基础，你对当前中国形势有何看法？
    答：从制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱到现在，只有五个半月的时间，我们党领导全国人民妥善地处理了这场惊心动魄的严重政治斗争，很快稳定了全国的局势。党的十三届四中全会解决了紧迫的政治、组织问题，确立了以江泽民同志为核心的中央领导集体，采取了一系列措施，做了大量工作，从总体上看是深得人心的。在西方帝国主义继续加紧对社会主义国家实施“和平演变”战略和国际社会主义事业陆续出现一些严重波折的情况下，中国局势稳定，政策稳定，人心稳定，顶住了国际上的反共逆流，继续沿着社会主义道路阔步前进，这无论是从当前还是从长远来看，意义都是巨大的、深远的。这是我国形势的主流，也是我们观察形势的基本立足点。
    五个多月的实践表明，我们的党是团结的、坚强的、经得起考验的，我们的人民是团结的、坚强的、经得起考验的。党和政府采取的制止动乱和平息暴乱的措施，越来越得到绝大多数人民的拥护。这充分说明，在中国这块辽阔的大地上，党的领导和社会主义深入人心。这是中国最基本的事实。没有这个最基本的事实，中国形势不可能在经历了剧烈的震荡之后，短短几个月内就发生了现在这样顺乎党心民心的变化。
    五个多月的实践还表明，四中全会确立的以江泽民同志为核心的新的领导集体的工作是卓有成效的。比如：在政治方面，全面地、坚决地贯彻执行党的“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线，改变了过去那种“一手软一手硬”的状况；在党的思想工作和组织工作方面，相继召开了全国宣传、组织工作会议，纠正了过去淡化和削弱党的领导，忽视思想政治工作，忽视党风建设的错误。当然不能说这方面存在的各种问题都已经解决了，但是党中央已经下定决心，逐步解决这方面大家迫切希望解决的问题。中国共产党是执政党，党的状况好坏决定着中国的命运和前途。中央明确提出，中国过去发生的多次失误，问题主要出在党内，解决问题也必须首先从党内抓起。这样提出问题和认识问题，充分表现了党的马克思主义的胆略和勇气。宣传工作端正了方向，坚持以马克思主义为指导，前个时期那种资产阶级自由化思潮严重泛滥并充斥于舆论阵地的状况，已经从根本上得到改变。关系到纯洁社会环境和净化人们心灵的扫黄斗争更是大得人心。在廉政建设上，党中央提出的办好七件事，体现出了两个鲜明的特色：一是从领导做起；二是狠抓实事，不说空话。当然也决不能说现在做得已经很够了，在廉政建设上还有大量工作要做，但毕竟有了个好的开端。过去多年形成的许多问题，特别是在动乱当中被别有用心的人利用来攻击党和政府的一些问题，现在已开始得到解决或正在解决。广大人民反映，现在大家的怨气消了一点，牢骚少了一点，笑脸多了一点，对党和政府的信任逐步地增强了。这恐怕应该说是实际情况的真实写照。在努力保持安定团结政治局面的同时，尽管动乱、暴乱给我们带来了巨大的损失，但整个国民经济还是在治理整顿中得到了继续发展。从外交工作来讲，应该说我们面临着相当严峻的形势。中央提出的方针是坚持原则，多做工作，坚决顶住干涉我国内政的各种外来压力。越来越多的事实表明，任何人想在国际范围内孤立中国是办不到的，是不可能的。中国的事业必将继续得到世界绝大多数国家和人民的支持。
    总之，五个多月的实践表明，拥有11亿人口的社会主义中国仍然巍然屹立在世界东方，它在世界人民面前展现的仍然是一个改革开放、蓬勃向上的社会主义国家的形象。
      正确认识当前的经济形势，既要充分
  肯定成绩，又要如实估计困难
    问：当前经济形势是每个人都关心的，现在众说不一。请你谈谈应当如何正确看待当前经济形势。
    答：在谈到经济形势之前，我之所以首先和你讲了讲当前我国总的形势，就是希望大家能够在这样的大背景下面来观察我国的经济问题。这样，我们才能更好地把握情况，也才能更好地理解五中全会着重讨论和解决经济问题的意义。
    至于说到经济情况本身，首先应该看到的是，10年建设和改革开放的成果巨大，这是举世公认的事实。10年来，我国国民生产总值按可比价格计算增长1.51倍，平均每年增长9.6％；城市居民平均每人生活费收入由316元增加到1119元，农民每人平均纯收入由134元增到545元，10年内增加411元。而1949年到1978年的29年间，农民人均纯收入仅增加90元。全国人民的温饱问题基本解决，农村贫困户大大减少。我国对外贸易和经济技术交流迅速扩大，外贸总额大幅度增长，进出口商品结构不断改善。可以列举的事实和数字还很多，它们都说明10年改革开放的成绩是巨大的，确实发生了过去任何一个时期都没有过的历史性变化。这是客观事实，是贯彻执行“一个中心、两个基本点”的党的基本路线带来的成果。
    在充分肯定成绩的同时，应当如实估计我们面临的问题和困难。这些问题和困难不是这一两年突然出现的，是1984年下半年以来逐年积累下来的。产生问题和困难的一个重要原因是思想上急于求成，脱离国情，超越国力，建设规模过大，发展速度过快。从1984年下半年开始，经济过热，财政连年有较多赤字，货币发行过多，国民经济比例失调，农业徘徊，加工工业发展过快，能源、原材料和交通运输紧张。同时，这些年来，国家财政收入占国民收入的比重下降，中央财政收入占国家财政收入的比重下降，削弱了宏观调控能力。前几年强调搞活微观经济是对的，应当充分肯定，但宏观调控能力削弱了，这对经济全局很不利。在治理整顿中要加强宏观调控，加强必要的适当的集中统一。
    目前，在对经济形势的认识上，特别值得注意的有两点：一是，对困难估计不足，因而认识不到治理整顿的必要性、复杂性和艰巨性；二是，对困难估计过重，因而产生畏难情绪，甚至丧失信心。对困难要作具体分析。就目前困难的严重程度来说，它同我们历史上曾经碰到过的困难相比，例如同60年代初和“文革”时期的困难相比，无疑要小得多。就克服困难的条件来说，有比过去好的一面，也有差的一面，总的来看还是好的一面多一些。其一，经过10年改革开放，国家经济实力大大增强，人民生活有了较大的改善，克服困难的回旋余地比过去大得多了；其二，经过一年来的治理整顿，取得了一定成效，积累了一些经验，有了一个好的开端；其三，经过前不久发生的那场风波，大家头脑更清醒了，对如何坚持社会主义方向看得更清楚了，人们对党中央的信心增强了。因此，我们完全有条件克服目前出现的前进中的暂时困难，没有任何理由丧失信心。
    问：治理整顿一年多，也取得了成效。主要表现在哪些方面？
    答：首先是通货膨胀率得到了一定的抑制。虽然今年的物价还是上涨了，但是从年初到现在，全社会零售物价的上涨幅度是逐月下降的。与去年同期相比，年初的时候上涨26％，现在已降到上涨12％左右。在这个总指数中，国务院确定的四十几种人民生活必需品的涨价幅度，比总的涨价幅度还要小得多。据观察，老百姓对市场情况的心情基本稳定。其次是过高的经济发展速度降了下来，固定资产投资比去年减少500亿元左右；消费基金的增长虽然还没有降到预期的程度，但也有所控制。第三是今年农业生产的情况还是不错的，夏粮产量创历史最高水平，秋粮总的来讲也比去年有所增产。第四是货币回笼情况比较好，储蓄大幅度增加，到现在为止已增加1000亿元，到年底预计可能增加1200亿元左右。当然，大家都热衷于保值储蓄，持币选购甚至储币不购，这也就成为某种程度的市场疲软的一个重要因素。总的来看，治理整顿的效果虽然还是初步的，但同样必须予以充分肯定。
    治理整顿过程中也出现了一些新情况。目前比较突出的是市场销售疲软，某些企业产品滞销，工业增长速度下滑过猛。对这个问题应该怎么看？首先应该看到，总的来说这是治理整顿过程中难以完全避免的现象。决不能因此而动摇治理整顿的决心，不能在整体上放松紧缩财政和金融的方针。与此同时，也要在宏观上采取必要的灵活的疏导措施，缓解某些企业和某些方面的资金困难。国务院已经决定陆续增加贷款的发放，10月份已开始做了，11、12月将继续增加。对企业来说，过去需求过旺，什么样的产品都能销出去，无论是提高产品质量，产品更新换代，还是调整产业和产品结构，都缺乏压力和动力。现在情况不同了，市场疲软，许多产品滞销，企业应该利用这个时机，大力调整结构，提高科技水平，改进产品质量，提高经济效益。从长远的根本的观点看问题，这对于中国经济的发展决不是坏事而是好事。
    分析和认识当前经济形势，应采取谨慎的态度。一方面，决不要因为出现了某些新问题而匆匆忙忙地放弃紧缩政策；另一方面，也要从实际出发采取必要的疏导措施。只要我们保持清醒的头脑，沉着应付，措施有力，目前的暂时困难是可以渡过的，治理整顿是一定能够搞好的。
        治理整顿和深化改革是辩证的统一，
    把两者对立起来是错误的
    问：现在有些人对治理整顿和深化改革的关系有些模糊认识，认为治理整顿是改革的停滞甚至是倒退。可否请你谈谈这两者之间的关系？
    答：这种认识是对中央关于治理整顿和深化改革方针的误解。前一段经济工作中某些做法违反了客观经济规律，带来了总量失衡，结构失调，通货膨胀，经济秩序混乱等问题。这些问题不解决，经济稳定增长是不可能的。治理整顿的目的，就是要使我国经济摆脱困境，实现持续、稳定、协调发展。因此，治理整顿非搞不可，是当前中国经济发展不可逾越的一个阶段。
    治理整顿怎么搞？五中全会总结了一年来治理整顿的经验，基本上把握了规律，据此确定了治理整顿工作的主要环节，概括来讲就是四句话十六个字：压缩需求，调整结构，整顿秩序，提高效益。
    深化改革也非进行不可。中国将坚定地走社会主义道路，这是任何人也改变不了的。而社会主义要发展，就一定要改革开放。不改革开放，社会主义就不可能有活力，它本来具有的优越性就发挥不出来，就不会有吸引力，相应的资产阶级自由化思潮就会有市场。我们一定要立足于这个基本点来考虑一切问题。改革是完善和发展社会主义制度的动力，是不可逆转的历史潮流。我们必须在坚持四项基本原则的前提下，从中国的国情出发，不断深化改革。一切有利于社会生产力发展的改革办法，都应当继续实行，并不断完善。
    在具体处理治理整顿与深化改革的关系上，有三个观点必须明确：第一，治理整顿决不是不要改革，而且它的许多措施决不能只靠行政命令来推行，必须依靠改革措施的配合；第二，治理整顿取得了成效，就会为改革的进一步深化和完善创造更为有利的条件。搞好治理整顿是深化改革不可缺少的条件。在总量失衡、结构失调、通货膨胀的情况下，许多改革措施无法实行。经济秩序混乱，公司又多又滥，不清理，不整顿，搞活经济的改革措施不仅难以达到目的，甚至会造成反效应；第三，治理整顿也好，深化改革也好，它们本身都不是目的，而是手段。我们不能为治理整顿而治理整顿，也不能为深化改革而深化改革，它们都是为了推进中国的社会主义现代化经济建设。因此，在治理整顿期间，必须克服把治理整顿和深化改革对立起来的错误认识和行为。
    在这三年或更长一些的时间里，主要的任务是治理整顿，改革应该围绕着治理整顿这个中心来进行。治理整顿和深化改革的措施，都要在每年的国家计划中具体加以落实。今年12月初就要召开的计划会议，将具体落实明年的治理整顿任务和各项改革措施。
    在治理整顿期间，各个地区、各个单位、各个机关团体，特别是企业，一定要努力开展增产节约、增收节支运动，把广大群众的积极性调动起来，深入开展社会主义劳动竞赛。
        无论在治理整顿期间，还是治理整顿
    任务完成以后，都不能再提倡脱离国情国
    力的所谓“大干快上”，必须坚持长期持
    续、稳定、协调发展的指导方针
    问：建国以后，我国经济进行过几次大的调整。每次的问题几乎都由经济过热引起，那么造成经济过热的根子究竟在哪里？
    答：这次中央全会深刻地总结了40年来我国经济工作中一条最重要的教训，就是经济发展决不能急于求成，不能大起大落。如果片面追求高速度，一时热热闹闹，似乎发展很快，表面上很繁荣，最终还得掉下来，并非人民的福音。社会生产力发展是一个长期的、渐进的逐步积累过程，只有在稳定的基础上，平衡地按比例协调发展，才能取得突出的进步。总量失衡，比例失调，大上大下，不但不能有效地积累生产力，而且往往造成巨大损失。过去的“过热——调整——再过热——再调整”，这种恶性循环必然形成对生产力的极大破坏。五中全会总结了历史的经验，明确提出了建设、改革、治理整顿都不能急于求成，无论治理整顿期间还是治理整顿完成之后，都不能搞脱离国情国力的所谓“大干快上”，必须坚持长期持续、稳定、协调发展的方针。持续，就是要长时间保持适当的合理发展速度；稳定，就是不要大起大落；协调，就是有计划按比例。这三者是相互联系的。没有一个较长时间的平稳发展，就谈不上稳定；大起大落，就谈不上持续发展；比例破坏了，持续、稳定发展都不可能。这是40年经验教训的总结。全党全国都要按这个方针办，长期不懈地坚持下去。只要坚持这个方针，保持适当的速度，有计划按比例地协调发展，我们就一定能够实现到本世纪末国民生产总值翻两番的战略目标。
        提倡过几年紧日子，主要是把现在的
  高消费、超前消费遏制住，坚决纠正铺张
  浪费、奢侈豪华的不正之风
    问：中央提出在治理整顿期间要过几年紧日子，对此应当怎样理解？
    答：提倡过几年紧日子，当然各个方面都必须紧缩财政开支，大力开源节流。但是，这也决不是说城乡居民的生活水平都要普遍下降。前几年消费基金增长过快，连续多年超过国民收入和劳动生产率的增长速度，引发了高消费和超前消费，也引发了在国民收入分配上过分地向企业和个人倾斜。1984年到1988年，我国国民收入增长70％（按现价计算增长149％），而全社会固定资产投资增长214％，城乡居民货币收入增长200％，实际上出现了“寅吃卯粮”的现象。这种情况也败坏了社会风气，把机关团体和企事业单位的开支抬上去了，铺张浪费奢侈之风滋长了。这决不利于经济和社会的发展，决没有任何好处。
    现在提倡过几年紧日子，就是要抑制消费基金的过度膨胀，抑制高消费和超前消费，煞住铺张浪费、奢侈豪华的不正之风，纠正在某些生活设施上脱离实际可能、盲目追求所谓“现代化”的现象，而不是要普遍降低人民的生活水平。
    过几年紧日子，不光是老百姓的事，首先要从各个机关团体、企事业单位和广大干部做起。从十三届四中全会以来几个月的实际情况看，吃喝风、请客送礼风已经受到遏制。当然，各地情况不大一样，有的好一些，有的差一些。但总的来讲正开始向好的方向转变。
        中国对外开放的总方针不会变，也决
    不会屈服于西方国家对我们实行的经济制
  裁，暂时的曲折和困难是完全能够克服的
    问：目前西方国家对我国实行经济制裁，我国经济在前进中又遇到了一些暂时的困难，面对这种情况有些人前进的信心不足，对此，你怎么看？
    答：西方有些国家对我国实行所谓的经济制裁，实质上是政治制裁。我们制止了动乱，平息了暴乱，使得他们要对我们国家实行“和平演变”的战略遭到了一次沉重的打击。他们不甘心失败，就用所谓经济制裁的办法，妄图使中国屈服，这种制裁会给我们带来暂时的困难，但是也没有什么了不起。西方有些国家的政府，各国的企业界，广大的商人，还有许多有识之士，对这种制裁也并不完全赞同。从几个月来的情况看，我们的对外贸易和经济关系还在发展，虽然受到一定影响，但影响并不太大，外商来华投资还有所增加。任何事情总有两面性。一方面，制裁给我们增加了一些困难；另一方面，也会提高我们自力更生的能力，激发人民发愤图强的精神。这一点对我们来说更具有本质的意义。从总体上讲，我国经济实力不断增强，国内市场广阔，人民具有艰苦创业的传统，我们有信心有能力把外来压力变成动力。另外，这种制裁也会给制裁者本身带来损失。中国的存在和发展是一个现实。中国有着现实的和潜力巨大的市场，是有吸引力的。据我看，所谓的制裁终究会取消，不可能长期搞下去，当然我们也决不幻想这种情况短期内会结束。我们从来就不曾企求依靠别人的施舍来实现我国的现代化，而是一贯主张把立足点放在依靠自己力量的基础上。这也决不意味着关起门来搞建设，我们还是要坚持对外开放，广交朋友，利用国际上一切可以利用的因素，加快我国的经济发展。中国已经打开的大门决不会再关上，因为这样做不符合中国现代化建设的要求，不符合人民的共同愿望和根本利益。
    目前我国外债余额是400亿美元。其中，有短期债务，也有长期债务，长期的居多；有中央借的，也有地方和企业借的，地方和企业借的居多。大概1990年将进入还债高峰，每年大体上要偿还七、八十亿美元。按国际惯例，这种情况虽已接近但还不到偿还外债的警戒线。中国一惯恪守国际信誉，我们是一定会也完全有能力偿还外债的。
        继续保持稳定是压倒一切的任务，政
    治要稳定，经济要稳定，整个社会要稳定
    最后，袁木同志对记者说：我们的国家要在社会主义道路上继续前进，当前关键的一条是保持整个国家的稳定。政治稳定是前提，经济稳定是基础，两者缺一不可，相互促进。为此，我们必须努力保持安定团结的政治局面，坚决执行十一届三中全会以来确立的基本路线和方针政策，保持政策的稳定性和连续性，这是一切工作的前提。没有国家的稳定，建设、改革、治理整顿都将一事无成。只要保持国家政治、经济、社会的稳定，到本世纪末国民生产总值翻两番的战略目标就一定能够实现。
    以上就是我学习五中全会精神的一些体会。我们坚信，只要全国上下同心协力，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，就一定能够克服困难，实现五中全会提出的治理整顿目标，巩固政治上的安定团结和达到经济上的持续、稳定、协调发展，把建设有中国特色的社会主义的伟大事业推向前进。
