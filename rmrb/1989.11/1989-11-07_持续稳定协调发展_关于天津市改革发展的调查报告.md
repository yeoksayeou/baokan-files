In the decade since the reform and opening-up, Tianjin has achieved remarkable results, steering its economy onto a path of sustained, stable, and coordinated development. Its distinctive features include the close integration of reform, opening-up, development, and innovation, as well as the coordinated development of the economy, science and technology, society, and politics. Tianjin's approach has a certain degree of originality, which experts refer to as the "Tianjin Model." Timely summarization and promotion of Tianjin's experiences will have positive significance for guiding the nation's rectification and adjustment, promoting reform and opening-up, and further advancing socialist construction.

In the long-term practice of reform and development, Tianjin has skillfully combined the national situation with the local conditions and public sentiment. Facing a series of new situations, new contradictions, and new problems, it has made correct choices and formed unique work ideas and methods. These can be roughly summarized into the following ten points:

1. **Prioritize the People**: Tianjin has consistently put the people first, relying on them to drive reform and development. Over the years, the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee and the municipal government have diligently worked to address over a hundred practical issues for the people, solving long-standing problems in people's lives and ensuring that the people see benefits and hope year after year. The people are placed in a leading role, and every effort is made to create conditions for them to participate in governance. Public sentiment is considered the first signal for decision-making feedback. If the majority of the people disagree with something, it is not easily implemented, regardless of the reasons. From demolishing temporary structures, diverting the Luan River to Tianjin, and implementing the gasification project, to constructing the inner ring road, outer ring road, and Tianjin Railway Station, all projects have mobilized the masses and relied on the people to achieve success, creating a dynamic and harmonious situation where leaders serve the people and the people work together with the leaders. As Deng Xiaoping pointed out during his inspection of Tianjin, "When the people are happy, things are easy to do and can be done well."

2. **Stable Progress**: Tianjin has consistently prioritized stability as a prerequisite for reform and the advancement of various undertakings, seeking good results and speed through stability. In practical work, three principles have been proposed: stability, steady progress, and prudence. Stability involves smoothing out various relationships, especially public sentiment, and creating a good social environment. Steady progress emphasizes both vigorous spirit and active progress, while avoiding rashness and impetuousness. Prudence ensures that any work, especially major reform measures and policies, is carefully prepared, considering all possible scenarios to minimize errors and reduce shocks. The "three stability" principles have effectively prevented the pursuit of too much too fast and hasty success. Although the national economic overheating wave in the past two years has also affected Tianjin, in terms of basic construction scale, consumption fund growth, and price increases, Tianjin's development has been fundamentally healthy.

3. **Integrate Reform and Development**: Tianjin's leaders view reform and development as a unified process of mutual constraint and promotion, planning and coordinating actions comprehensively. On one hand, many contradictions and problems in economic construction are addressed through reform; on the other hand, reform tasks are proposed around economic and social development. In industrial production, the "double increase, double savings" approach is combined with contract responsibility systems to achieve increased production and income through contracts. In the circulation sector, increasing supply and market prosperity is combined with commercial system reform, implementing a one-stop service for food products. In urban management, the goal of developing a "small city" in the urban area is combined with reforming the urban management system, effectively promoting the rapid development of district and street economic and cultural undertakings. The approach of "combining" integrates reform measures into the practical work of the broad masses of workers, effectively promoting economic and social development and creating a good environment for reform.

4. **Controlled Opening-Up**: Tianjin has emphasized planned opening-up and controlled activation, developing commodity economy under the condition of strengthening macro-control. Li Ronghuan, who long oversaw Tianjin's work, once said, "The relationship between macro-control and micro-activation should be like flying a kite—released but with a string attached. The higher it flies, the better. It should not be like releasing a bird—once released, it's out of sight, uncontrollable, and unrecoverable." Tianjin's specific operational art of this dialectical relationship between release and control is: (1) Control without killing, activate without chaos. Control does not use old methods from the previous system; release is not a free-for-all, not hoping to solve everything through the market. (2) The degree and scope of release depend on control capabilities. When control capabilities are insufficient, even if something should be released, it is not done hastily, and a one-step-to-completion approach is not taken. (3) Both release and control should consider the overall situation and long-term planning, preventing short-term behavior in decision-making. (4) Comprehensive use of economic, political, legal, and educational means for macro-control, focusing on comprehensive governance of the economic environment, and not relying on quick fixes.

5. **Incremental Progress**: Tianjin's leaders recognize that reform is a long-term historical process of self-improvement of the socialist system, with inherent gradual, synchronous, and detour characteristics. Therefore, when determining the reform focus and supporting measures for each period, they always base it on realistic conditions, follow the objective requirements of economic development, and fully consider the emotions and psychological tolerance of the broad masses. They pay attention to the phased and step-by-step implementation of reform, sometimes taking transitional measures. During the reform process, they are always ready to coordinate and adjust, timely solving various imbalances, and preventing serious maladjustments through frequent "micro-adjustments."

6. **Enterprise Reform**: Tianjin has focused on developing productive forces, placing the reform focus on enterprises. Based on improving enterprise economic benefits, it supports and accelerates other aspects of reform. In enterprise reform, it emphasizes the configuration, improvement, and deepening of the contract responsibility system, focusing on mobilizing the enthusiasm of employees. It carefully handles the relationship between the state and enterprises, and between enterprises and employees, ensuring that workers continuously improve their living standards while improving economic benefits. It creates external conditions for enterprise reform from multiple aspects, strengthening the coordination and service of leading departments and the support of comprehensive departments, helping enterprises solve practical problems encountered during reform.

7. **Learn from the West and Leverage Political Advantages**: Tianjin's leaders, at various stages of reform and opening-up, have continuously unified the understanding of leaders at all levels. On one hand, they resolutely prevent copying and transplanting foreign models, avoiding the loss of domestic traditional advantages while learning good things from abroad. On the other hand, they oppose mechanical views on political advantages, insisting on innovation based on the inheritance of the Party's traditional advantages. In all work, they insist on "grasping both material and spiritual civilization, achieving both results"; at critical moments when reform requires adjusting public interests, they emphasize the leading role of Party members, stabilizing emotions; they use ideological education, material interests, and administrative management to mobilize the enthusiasm of employees, opposing the idea of "everything for money." They use effective methods such as political mobilization and voluntary labor in major construction projects, continuously improving people's ideological level; they widely carry out dialogue and heart-to-heart services, increasing the channels for communication between the Party and the people; they take respecting, understanding, caring for, and loving people as the guiding principles of ideological and political work, striving to make people feel happy and fully utilize their talents. Today, Tianjin's high morale and the ability to maintain stability and unity at critical moments are inseparable from the leaders' persistent efforts to leverage political advantages.

8. **Comprehensive and Coordinated Development**: Tianjin views the city as a multi-level, multi-functional, highly integrated, interrelated, and constrained whole. In modernization construction, it combines urban construction with economic development, long-term development with solving urgent problems, single-item construction with comprehensive development, and improvement of material conditions with spiritual civilization construction. While paying attention to comprehensive development, the city has focused on the construction of energy, water, transportation, and communication infrastructure, correspondingly increasing commercial, postal, educational, and health facilities, eliminating many long-standing negative factors that seriously constrain industrial and overall economic development, and creating a good environment for large-scale economic construction.

9. **Optimize Industrial Structure**: Over the past decade, Tianjin has adjusted, transformed, and newly built and expanded its industries according to market-oriented, focused, and selective principles. From 1979 to 1987, the city had over 6,300 industrial renovation and transformation projects in operation, with an investment of over 8 billion yuan; it signed over 1,200 foreign advanced technology projects, with a transaction amount of over $800 million. Now, the industrial structure, product structure, and technological structure have been significantly optimized; the technological level, management level, and economic benefits of enterprises have been significantly improved. The labor productivity of the entire industry has increased by 55.8% in 10 years, with an average annual increase of 5%. The realized profits and taxes of the city's independent accounting industrial enterprises have increased by an average of 6.6% annually; after deducting factors such as raw material price increases, it has exceeded the average annual growth rate of industrial output value during the same period.

10. **Improve Investment Environment**: Since implementing opening-up, Tianjin has always paid attention to the construction of the investment environment. While strengthening urban infrastructure construction and improving the hard environment, it has also paid attention to the development and transformation of the soft environment. The city has established a foreign investment service center, with 8 government departments and 14 social service units operating jointly; it has gradually established and improved a set of foreign-related regulations; it has trained a large number of foreign-related personnel. In the past 10 years, Tianjin has signed 324 foreign-funded enterprises, with a signed amount of $740 million, of which foreign investment is $330 million. After the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone was gradually built, foreign investors showed more interest in Tianjin. An American familiar with the situation in China said: "China has emerged with a new and better investment site, which is Tianjin. I suggest that American businessmen invest in Tianjin."

After 10 years of sustained, stable, and coordinated development, Tianjin has created a new situation, laying a solid foundation for future development, and its role in the country's reform and development has become increasingly notable. Its specific achievements are:

- **Enhanced Urban Functionality**: The city has formed a "three-ring, fourteen-radiating" traffic skeleton, with a total of 1,100 kilometers of highways connecting in all directions, expanded Tianjin Port, added air routes, and completed the Tianjin Railway Hub transformation project, initially forming a sea, land, and air transportation system. The city's telephone, long-distance telephone, telex, microwave, and satellite communication information transmission networks have taken shape, allowing direct communication with 339 domestic cities and 39 countries and regions internationally. The diversion of the Luan River has changed the situation where production development was constrained by water. Electricity, water, and gas supply capabilities have gradually shifted from shortage to balance. Drainage and sewage treatment capabilities have been significantly strengthened, the urban environment has been improved, and a number of important commercial service facilities have been completed. Tianjin's credit rating for utilizing foreign capital has been rated as "2A" internationally, which is unique in the country.

- **Advanced Industrial Technology**: This comprehensive old industrial base with over 150 industries has seen more than half of its industries and enterprises undergo technological transformation. Microcars, color TVs, refrigerators, copiers, submersible electric pumps, and over 1,000 other products have reached domestic advanced levels, with some reaching international advanced levels. Product structures are more in line with domestic and international market needs. In 1987, the net output value of short-line products accounted for 77% of the city's industrial output value growth.

- **Social Stability and Unity**: Democratic atmosphere has been strengthened, people's material living standards have continuously improved, cultural and artistic undertakings have flourished, and the level of spiritual civilization has been enhanced. The city's criminal case rate is approximately one-third of the national urban and rural criminal case rate, making it one of the regions with the best social order in the country.

- **High Morale Among Cadres and the Masses**: The Party Committee and the government have a pragmatic and hardworking style, enjoying high prestige and strong appeal among the people. Workers have formed a style of daring to and being good at fighting hard battles, creating the "Tianjin Speed" that emphasizes quality and efficiency. The Luan River project was completed in just 16 months, the inner and outer ring roads in 10 months each, and the Tianjin Railway Hub transformation project reduced the planned construction period by more than half. These are outstanding examples of the Tianjin people's creative spirit in recent years.

Like other regions in the country, Tianjin's reform and development have been achieved by overcoming negative factors, with each step forward accompanied by difficulties and twists. Currently, Tianjin faces the following main difficulties and problems: (1) The comprehensive functions of the urban carrier are not fully utilized. Water, electricity, roads, and communication infrastructure have prepared relatively sufficient conditions for further development, but a considerable amount of capacity is currently idle and urgently needs to be utilized in conjunction with other facilities. (2) The sharp increase in raw material, electricity, and transportation costs, and the repeated increase in bank interest rates, have made it difficult for this city, which is mainly engaged in processing, to digest, and reduced its industrial self-development capabilities. (3) The heavy burden of loans and the beginning of fiscal decline. Currently, Tianjin's loan balance is about 1.5 times higher than that of other large cities, with an annual payment of 400 million yuan in bank interest. (4) The expenditure of various undertakings has been implemented according to the provincial-level city standard, seriously affecting the development of science and technology, education, culture, and other undertakings.

Tianjin has many advantages. Backed by the capital, it has economic radiation to 11 provinces (autonomous regions) and cities, facing the economically active Pacific region and Northeast Asia, with relatively abundant natural resources, technology-intensive, and a good foundation for international cooperation. The huge potential advantages and good real environment show the broad prospects for Tianjin's future development. As long as Tianjin's leaders and the masses continue to adhere to the original reform and development path, and in the process of rectification and adjustment, seriously summarize experiences, improve the "Tianjin Model," and with the appropriate support of the state, this old industrial city on the western shore of the Pacific will definitely regain its vigor and make greater contributions to the modernization construction of the motherland.

    持续稳定协调发展
    ——关于天津市改革发展的调查报告
    国务院经济技术社会发展研究中心天津改革与发展研究组
    改革开放十年，天津取得了举国瞩目的成绩，经济走上了一条持续、稳定、协调发展的路子。其特点是改革、开放、发展、创新紧密结合，经济、科技、社会、政治协调发展。天津的路子具有一定的独创性，专家们称之为“天津模式”。及时总结、推广天津经验，对指导全国治理整顿，推动改革开放和社会主义建设进一步发展具有积极意义。
    在长期改革发展实践中，天津市善于把国情与天津的市情、民情相结合，面对一系列新情况、新矛盾、新问题，作出正确的选择，形成了特有的工作思路和方法。这些大致可归纳为以下十点：
    一、把一切为人民、一切依靠人民作为推进改革发展的基本指导思想。
    多年来，中共天津市委和市政府尽心竭力地为群众办了上百件实事，解决了一批长期得不到解决的群众生活难题，使群众年年得到实惠，步步看到希望。坚持把人民群众摆在主人翁地位，尽可能创造条件让群众参政议政。把群众情绪作为决策反馈的第一信号，对于大多数群众不同意的事，纵然有多少理由也不轻易行动。从拆临建棚、引滦入津、搞民用气化工程，到建设中环线、外环线、天津火车站，各项事业都大力发动群众，紧紧依靠人民群众去完成，形成了领导为群众办事，群众与领导同心协力的生动、和谐的局面。现在天津的局面，正如邓小平同志在津视察时所指出的那样：“群众高兴了，事情就好办，也容易办好。”
    二、坚持稳中求进的改革发展方针。
    天津一直把稳定作为改革和推进各项事业的前提，以稳求好，以稳求快。在实际工作中提出了三条原则：一是稳定。注意理顺各种关系，特别是群众的情绪，努力创造良好的社会环境。二是稳步。强调既要振奋精神，积极进取，又不能操之过急，盲目冒进。三是稳妥。坚持任何工作，特别是重大改革措施和政策的出台要周密准备，想到万一，尽量避免失误，减少震动。“三稳”原则有效地防止了贪多求快，急于求成。尽管这两年全国性的经济过热浪潮也波及到天津，但从基本建设规模、消费基金增长和物价上涨幅度来看，天津的发展基本上是健康的。
    三、把改革和发展结合起来前进。
    天津市领导视改革与发展为相互制约、相互促进的统一过程，在操作中全面规划、协调动作。一方面经济建设中的许多矛盾和问题，注意通过改革找出路；另一方面紧紧围绕经济和社会发展提出改革的新任务。在工业生产上，把“双增双节”与经营承包结合在一起，通过承包实现增产增收；在流通环节中，把增加供应、繁荣市场与商业体制改革结合在一起，实行副食品产销一条龙；在城市管理工作中，把发展市区“小城市”的目标与改革市区管理体制结合起来，有效地促进了区街经济文化事业的迅速发展，等等。“结合在一起”的做法把改革的措施贯彻到了广大劳动者的具体实践中，有效地促进了经济和社会的发展，也给改革创造了好环境。
    四、有计划地开放，有控制地搞活，在加强宏观调控的条件下发展商品经济。
    曾经长期主持天津市工作的李瑞环同志这样讲过：“宏观控制与微观搞活的关系，应该像放风筝，放出去了，有线牵着。放得高是水平高的表现。而不应该像放生，放出去后看不见，管不了，回不来。”天津市贯穿这种放与管辩证关系的具体操作艺术是：（一）控而不死，活而不乱。控，不使用旧体制时的老办法；放也不是大撒手，不奢望靠市场解决一切问题。（二）放开的程度与范围取决于控制能力。在控制能力达不到时，即使是应该放的，也不贸然行事，不搞一步到位。（三）放和控都要从全局出发，长远考虑，防止决策上的短期行为。（四）综合运用经济的、政治的、法律的、教育的手段实行宏观调控，对经济环境立足于全面治理，不侥幸使用偏方。
    五、坚持迈小步不停步。
    市领导认识到改革是社会主义制度自我完善的长期历史过程，渐进性、同步性、迂回性是其固有特征。因此，在确定每一个时期的改革重点和配套措施时，一定立足于现实条件，遵循经济发展的客观要求，并充分考虑到广大群众的情绪和心理承受能力，注意使改革分阶段、有步骤地进行，有时须采取一些过渡性措施。改革的进程中随时做好协调和调整工作，及时解决各种不平衡的现象，以经常性的“微调”防止严重失调下的“大修理”。
    六、把深化企业改革确定为各项改革的中心环节。
    天津市紧紧盯住发展社会生产力这个基本目标，把改革的重心落在企业。在提高企业经济效益的基础上支持和加速其它方面的改革。在企业改革中，抓住承包制的配套、完善和深化，把改革的着眼点放在调动职工积极性上。十分慎重地处理好国家与企业、企业与职工的关系，千方百计保证劳动者在提高经济效益的前提下不断提高生活水平。注意从多方面为企业创造改革的外部条件，加强领导部门的协调服务和综合部门的配合支持，帮助企业解决改革中遇到的实际问题。
    七、把借鉴国外先进经验与发挥社会主义政治优势结合起来。
    市领导在改革开放的各个发展阶段，不断统一各级领导干部的认识，一方面坚决防止照抄、照搬外国模式，避免国外的好东西没有学到手，反而丢掉了国内的传统优势；另一方面反对用机械的观点对待政治优势，坚持在继承党的传统优势基础上，不断创新。在各项工作中，坚持“两个文明一起抓，两个成果一起要”；在改革需要调整群众利益的关键时刻，注意发挥党员的带头作用，稳定情绪；采用思想教育、物质利益、行政管理三管齐下的方式调动职工积极性，反对“一切向钱看”，把政治动员、义务劳动等行之有效的办法运用到重大的建设工程中去，不断提高人们的思想境界；广泛开展对话和谈心服务活动，增加党与人民群众沟通的渠道；把尊重人、理解人、关心人、爱护人作为思想政治工作的指导原则，努力使人们心情舒畅，各尽其才，等等。今天天津市人民高昂的士气，在重要关头能保持安定团结的局面，都是同领导坚持不懈地发挥政治优势分不开的。
    八、强调全面协调发展，加强基础设施建设，提高城市的载体功能。
    天津把城市看作是一个多层次、多功能、高度综合、互相联系与制约的整体，在现代化建设中实行市政建设与经济发展相结合，长远发展与解决紧迫问题相结合，单项建设与综合开发相结合，改善城市物质条件与精神文明建设相结合等等。在注意综合发展的同时，全市突出抓了能源、水源、交通、通讯等基础设施建设，相应地增加了商业、邮电、文教、卫生等设施，消除了许多长期严重制约工业和整个经济发展的消极因素，为大规模经济建设创造了良好的环境。
    九、工业生产注重优化结构、提高水平、讲究实效，走集约化道路，而不盲目追求产值增长高速度。
    10年来，天津市按照市场为导向，突出重点，有取有舍的原则，对全市工业进行了调整、改造和新建扩建。从1979年到1987年，全市有6300多项工业更新改造项目投产，完成投资80多亿元；引进国外先进技术项目签约1200多个，成交金额8亿多美元。现在，产业结构、产品结构、技术结构得到了显著优化；企业的技术水平、经营管理水平、经济效益明显改善。工业全员劳动生产率10年增长55.8％，年均递增5％。全市独立核算工业企业实现利税年均递增6.6％；若扣除原材料上涨等因素，超过了同期工业产值的年均递增速度。
    十、对外开放注重抓改善投资环境。
    实行对外开放以来，天津一直很重视投资环境的建设。在加强城市基础设施建设、改善硬环境的同时，也很注意软环境的开发和改造。市里建立了国外投资服务中心，8个政府部门和14个社会服务单位实行联合办公；逐步建立和完善了一套涉外法规；培训了大批涉外工作人员。10年来，天津已签约的三资企业共324家，签约金额7.4亿美元，其中外方投资3.3亿美元。天津经济技术开发区逐步建设起来以后，国外投资者对天津更感兴趣。一位熟悉中国情况的美国人说：中国现在又出现了一个年轻的较好的投资场所，那就是天津，“我建议美国的企业家到天津去投资。”
    经过10年持续稳定协调发展，天津开创了一个崭新的局面，为今后的发展奠定了坚实的基础，对国家改革和发展所起的作用越来越引人注目。其具体成果表现为：
    ——城市载体的综合功能大大提高。全市已形成“三环十四射”的交通骨架，总长1100公里的公路四通八达，扩建了天津港，增辟了空中航线，完成了天津铁路枢纽改造工程，初步形成了海、陆、空运输体系。市内电话、长途电话、电传、微波、卫星通讯等信息传递网络已初具规模，可与国内339个城市、国际上39个国家和地区直接通话。引滦入津改变了生产发展受制于水的局面。发电、供水、供气能力由短缺逐渐趋于平衡。排水和处理污水能力大大加强，市容得到整治，一批重要的商业服务设施相继建成。天津利用外资的资信度被国际评为“2A”信用级，这在国内是唯一的城市。
    ——工业技术水平迈上新台阶。这个有150多个行业的综合性老工业基地，现在一半以上的产业、企业已得到技术改造。微型汽车、彩电、电冰箱、复印机、潜油电泵等1000多种产品达到国内先进水平，有的已达国际先进水平。产品结构更加适合国内外市场需要。1987年短线产品的净产值占全市工业产值增长额的77％。
    ——社会安定团结。民主气氛加强，人民物质生活不断改善，文艺事业蓬勃发展，社会精神文明程度提高。全市刑事发案率约等于全国城乡刑事发案率的1／3，是全国社会治安状况最好的地区之一。
    ——干部群众精神高昂。党委和政府作风求实、艰苦，在群众中享有较高威望，号召力较强。职工群众形成了敢于和善于打硬仗的作风，创造了讲究质量、注重效率的“天津速度”。引滦工程只用16个月，中、外环线各10个月，天津铁路枢纽改造工程比计划工期减少一半以上，这些都是近几年天津人民创造精神的突出表现。
    与全国其它地区一样，天津的改革和发展是在不断克服消极因素中实现的，每前进一步都伴随着困难和曲折。目前天津面临的主要困难和问题是：一、城市载体功能得不到充分发挥。水、电、路、讯等基础设施已为进一步发展准备了较充足的条件，但目前相当大的能力处于闲置状态，急需配套利用。二、原材料、电力、运输费用大幅度上涨，银行利率一再提高，使这个以加工业为主的城市难以消化，工业自我发展能力降低。三、贷款负担沉重，财政开始滑坡。目前天津的贷款余额比其他大城市高出1倍左右，一年支付银行利息达4亿元。四、各项事业经费开支一直按省辖市标准执行，严重地影响了科技、教育、文化等事业的发展。
    天津有着很多得天独厚的条件。背靠首都，对内经济辐射达11个省（区）、市，面向经济发展活跃的太平洋地区和东北亚地区，自然资源较丰富，技术密集，同国外联系基础较好等等。巨大的潜在优势和良好的现实环境展示了天津未来发展的广阔前景。只要天津市领导和群众继续坚持原有的改革发展路子，并且在治理、整顿中认真总结经验，提高“天津模式”的档次，再加上国家的适当扶持，这个太平洋西岸的老工业城市，一定能焕发出更强的活力，对祖国的现代化建设作出更大的贡献。
