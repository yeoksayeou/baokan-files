	Chinese Representative Chen Shiqiu today at the 44th Session of the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly refuted the remarks made by the U.S. Ambassador Pickering, who used human rights, reform, and the unrest in Tibet as pretexts to interfere in China's internal affairs.

	Chen Shiqiu said, "Recently, the United States and some Western countries have been relentlessly attacking China on human rights issues. The fundamental reason is that the situation in China has not developed according to their wishes. If China adopted the political system they like, if China changed in the way they hope, if the Chinese government allowed the Dalai Lama and a few Tibetan separatists to succeed in their plots to disrupt the unity of China's ethnic groups and split China's territory, China's human rights situation would certainly not be criticized by them, and might even be praised by them."

	Chen Shiqiu further pointed out, "When some Western countries discuss human rights issues, they always want to appear in a benevolent and humanitarian guise, and often use phrases like 'human rights should be depoliticized.' In reality, their politicization and ideologization of human rights issues surpasses that of any other country. Their political goals are the most explicit. They want all socialist countries and the vast majority of developing countries to adopt their views on human rights and values. Those who do not accept their views will be pressured, and their human rights issues will be scrutinized."

	On the issue of reform, Chen Shiqiu said, "Insisting on reform and opening up is China's established policy. But the problem now is that some foreign countries are trying to use sanctions, blockades, and the human rights stick to pressure China to reform according to their wishes." He pointed out, "Any attempt to use pressure to shake China's social system and change the beliefs of the Chinese people is doomed to fail."

	Chen Shiqiu said that in March of this year, several riots occurred in China's Tibet Autonomous Region. These were not ethnic or religious issues, nor were they human rights issues; rather, they were activities planned and orchestrated by a few domestic and foreign separatists aimed at splitting Tibet from China. He mentioned, "Since the 13th century, Tibet has been an inseparable part of China's sacred territory, a fact recognized by all countries, including the United States." The U.S. Ambassador, in his speech, mentioned the "independence march" in Tibet. Chen Shiqiu questioned whether the U.S. Ambassador's remarks indicated a change in the U.S. government's stance, openly supporting the activities that disrupt China's unity and split China's territory?

	Chen Shiqiu solemnly pointed out, "Currently, some countries are ignoring the norms of international relations and attempting to meddle in Tibet's affairs, openly or covertly supporting the activities of the Dalai Lama and a few separatists. This is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs and is absolutely unacceptable and will not succeed."

    我代表在联大三委会答辩中
　　驳斥美大使干涉我内政的言论
    本报联合国11月27日电　记者刘开宸报道：中国代表陈士球今天在第44届联大三委会议答辩中驳斥了美国大使皮克林借口人权、改革和西藏骚乱问题干涉我国内政的言论。
    陈士球说，“近来美国和一些西方国家极力攻击中国人权问题，其根本原因在于，中国局势并没有按照他们的愿望发展。如果中国实行他们喜欢的政治制度，如果中国按照他们希望的那样发生变化，如果中国政府听任达赖喇嘛和西藏少数分裂主义者破坏中国各民族团结、分裂中国统一的阴谋得逞，中国的人权状况肯定不会受到他们的批评，还很可能受到他们的赞扬。”
    陈士球接着指出，“某些西方国家在谈论人权问题时总想以慈善和人道的面孔出现，也常用人权要非政治化这类词藻，但实际上他们自己在人权问题上的政治化和意识形态化超过任何其他国家，他们的政治目标是最鲜明的，他们要所有社会主义国家和广大发展中国家推行他们的人权观和价值观，谁不接受就向谁施加压力，就要审议谁的人权问题”。
    陈士球谈到改革问题时说，“坚持改革开放是我国的既定政策。但现在的问题是有些外国企图用制裁、封锁和人权的大棒来压中国按他们的意图实行改革。”他指出，“任何企图用施加压力的办法动摇中国的社会制度、改变中国人民的信仰，都是注定要失败的”。
    陈士球说，今年3月在我国西藏自治区发生了几次骚乱，既不是民族宗教问题，也不是人权问题，而是国内外少数分裂主义分子蓄意策划制造的企图分裂我国西藏领土的活动。他谈到，“从公元13世纪起，西藏就是中国神圣领土不可分割的一部分，这是包括美国在内的任何国家都承认的事实”，美国大使在其发言中谈到西藏“独立游行”，不知美国大使讲话是否预示美国政府立场发生了变化，要公开支持破坏中国统一、分裂中国领土的活动？
    陈士球严正指出，“现在确有些国家无视国际关系准则，企图插手西藏问题，明里暗里支持达赖喇嘛等少数分裂主义分子的活动，这是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，是绝对不能允许的，也是不可能得逞的。”
