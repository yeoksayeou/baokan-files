According to statistics compiled by Lloyd's of London, international ship losses in 1988 dropped to the lowest level since 1970. Although the actual number of ships lost in 1988 increased from 214 in 1987 to 231, the tonnage lost decreased from 1.284 million tons in 1987 to 0.864 million tons. The record tonnage loss in 1986 was 2.609 million tons. In 1988, 763 people died or went missing in maritime accidents. The deadliest maritime accident occurred during the "Luby" typhoon in October 1988, when a Philippine ferry capsized and sank, resulting in 400 deaths. The largest total loss of a ship was a 235,000-ton oil tanker that was destroyed by shelling in the Persian Gulf in May 1988; another oil tanker, with a total tonnage of 564,000 tons, the largest ship in the world, was also hit by shells during the same incident, and its current status is unknown. Since the end of hostilities in the Gulf in July 1988, ship losses due to war have decreased. The three countries with the highest number of total losses are: Japan (32 ships), Panama (27 ships), and the United Kingdom (13 ships). The country with the highest tonnage loss is Panama, with a total loss of 1.73 million tons; second is Cyprus, with 1.71 million tons; third is Spain, with 1.24 million tons.

    一九八八年世界船舶损失减少
    据伦敦劳埃德船舶社汇编的统计资料，一九八八年的国际船舶损失下降到自一九七○年以来的最低水平。尽管一九八八年实际损失的船舶数量从一九八七年的二百一十四艘增至二百三十一艘，但损失的吨位却从一九八七年的一百二十八点四万吨降至八十六点四万吨，一九八六年创纪录的吨位损失为二百六十点九万吨。一九八八年死于海难或失踪的有七百六十三人。最大的海难死亡事件发生于一九八八年十月“卢比”台风侵袭期间，菲律宾渡船倾覆沉没，造成四百人丧生。最大的全损船只是总载重量为二十三点五万吨、于一九八八年五月在波斯湾被炮弹击毁的一艘油轮；在同一事件中挨炮击的另一油轮，总载重量为五十六点四万吨，是世界上最大的船舶，现今情况不明。自一九八八年七月海湾的敌对状态结束以来，因战争而造成的船舶损失减少了。全损船只数量最高的三个国家是：日本（三十二艘）、巴拿马（二十七艘）、英国（十三艘）。船舶吨位损失最高的国家是巴拿马，吨位总损失为十七点三万吨；第二是塞浦路斯，十七点一万吨；第三是西班牙，十二点四万吨。
