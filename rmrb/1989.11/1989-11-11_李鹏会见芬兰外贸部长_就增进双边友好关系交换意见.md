Li Peng Meets with Finnish Minister of Foreign Trade
Exchanges Views on Enhancing Bilateral Friendly Relations

Xinhua News Agency, November 10, Beijing — (Reporter Zhou Cixu) Premier Li Peng emphasized today that the recently concluded Fifth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China will have a profound impact on China's political and economic life.

He made these remarks while briefing the visiting Finnish Minister of Foreign Trade, Bertil Salolainen, and his delegation on the meeting's proceedings at Zhongnanhai.

Li Peng said, "We will unswervingly carry out the reform and opening-up policy initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping."

In a friendly atmosphere, Li Peng and Salolainen exchanged views on further enhancing friendly cooperation between China and Finland, particularly in economic and trade relations.

Salolainen had accompanied Finnish President Mauno Koivisto on a visit to China last year. Premier Li Peng happily recalled that visit, praising President Koivisto's state visit to China as very successful, which enhanced friendly cooperation between the two countries and the friendship between their peoples.

Li Peng asked Salolainen to convey his greetings to President Koivisto upon his return to Finland, wishing for the continuous development of Sino-Finnish relations.
