	Article 3: Enterprises hiring temporary workers shall sign labor contracts with the temporary workers and file them with the local labor administration department. The contracts shall be terminated upon the expiration of the contract period. Labor contracts shall be signed on the basis of equality and mutual consent and shall be legally binding once signed.

	Article 4: Enterprises needing temporary workers shall, in principle, hire them from urban areas; if it is necessary to hire them from rural areas, approval must be obtained from the labor administration department of a prefecture-level city or equivalent. Temporary workers hired from rural areas shall not have their household registration or grain ration transferred.

	Article 5: The wage treatment of temporary workers shall be stipulated by the people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government in accordance with the wage income of contract workers of the same type and position, and the specific standards shall be negotiated between the employing enterprise and the temporary worker and stipulated in the labor contract.

	Article 6: Temporary workers who die from work-related injuries during their employment shall receive the same treatment as contract workers. Temporary workers who are injured on the job during their employment shall receive the same medical treatment as contract workers. After the medical treatment is completed, the labor appraisal committee shall determine the degree of disability. Those who completely lose their ability to work shall be treated the same as contract workers; those who partially lose their ability to work shall be assigned appropriate work within the contract period. Upon expiration of the contract, the enterprise shall handle the matter according to the specific methods determined by the people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government.

	Article 7: The sick leave period for temporary workers who fall ill or are injured for non-work-related reasons shall be determined according to the length of their employment in the enterprise, with a maximum of three months. During the medical leave period, their medical treatment shall be the same as that of contract workers. During the sick leave period, the enterprise shall, at its discretion, provide living subsidies. If the worker recovers but is unable to continue the original work, or if the medical leave period expires but the worker has not recovered, the labor contract shall be terminated. For those whose employment period is more than six months and who are terminated due to illness or non-work-related injury but have not recovered, the enterprise shall pay a one-time medical subsidy; for those who die from illness or non-work-related injury, the enterprise shall pay funeral expenses and a one-time subsidy for supporting direct dependents.

	The standards for the payment of the aforementioned fees shall be determined by the people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government at a level lower than the national standards for contract workers.

The standards for the payment and management of the insurance fund shall be handled in accordance with the "Interim Provisions on the Implementation of the Contract Labor System in State-Owned Enterprises."

Those engaged in special occupations such as crane operation, electrical work, welding, and boiler operation must also undergo training and pass the assessment. Protective measures must be taken in toxic, harmful, and hazardous workplaces before temporary workers can be hired.
