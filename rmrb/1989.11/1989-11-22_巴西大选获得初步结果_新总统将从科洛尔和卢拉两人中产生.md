	Brazil's presidential election has obtained preliminary results: the new president will be chosen between Fernando Collor de Mello of the National Rebirth Party and Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers' Party.

	Our correspondent Lan Caiji reports from Brasilia on November 19: After four days of vote counting, the preliminary results of Brazil's presidential election are as follows: Fernando Collor de Mello of the National Rebirth Party and Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers' Party have secured the first and second positions respectively. Since neither candidate received more than half of the votes, the next president of Brazil will be determined through a second round of voting between these two candidates.

	The Brazilian Supreme Electoral Court announced the vote count results this evening: in the 97.3% of votes that have been counted, Collor received 28.14% of the votes, while Lula received 17.08%. In effect, these two candidates have become the top two in this election. The final results of this round will be officially announced in the coming days. According to Brazilian election law, if no candidate receives more than half of the votes, a second round of voting must be held between the top two candidates. The second round of voting will take place on December 17.

	Brazil's election began on November 15, with 21 candidates from various parties participating in the presidential race. Political commentators here believe that as the election enters the second round, new alliances and divisions will emerge among the parties. The competition between the left and right wings will become more intense and complex. Who will ultimately take residence in the presidential palace, the Planalto Palace, will only be clear in the final stages of the election.

　　巴西大选获得初步结果
　　新总统将从科洛尔和卢拉两人中产生
    本报巴西利亚11月19日电　记者兰才基报道：巴西总统竞选经过4天开票统计已经获得初步结果：国家复兴党候选人费尔南多·科洛尔·德梅洛和劳工党候选人路易斯·伊纳西奥·卢拉·达席尔瓦得票分别居第一位和第二位，由于得票未超过半数，因比巴西下一任总统将从这两位候选人中通过第二轮全民投票选举产生。
    巴西最高选举法庭今天晚上公布的计票结果是：在已经统计的97.3％的选票中，科洛尔得票占28.14％，卢拉得票占17.08％，实际上已经成为这次大选中得票最多的两名总统候选人，这轮大选的最后结果将于近日内正式公布。按照巴西选举法规定，在所有的总统候选人得票均未超过半数的情况下，必需在得票最多的前两名候选人中进行第二轮投票选举。第二轮投票将于12月17日举行。
    巴西这次大选是在本月15日开始举行的，参加总统竞选的各政党候选人达21名之多。据此间的政治评论家们认为，在进入第二轮竞选阶段，各党派之间的关系将出现新的分化和组合，左、右两大阵线之间的角逐会变得更加激烈和复杂，到底谁能入主总统府高原宫，只能在大选最后阶段才可见分晓。
