Nicaragua has requested an emergency summit of Central American leaders to discuss the proposal of timely demobilization of Nicaraguan anti-government forces, which was rejected today by Honduras and Costa Rica.

According to a report by Mexican Television, the talks between the Nicaraguan government and anti-government forces at the headquarters of the Organization of American States in Washington broke down yesterday, with both sides failing to reach any agreement on the demobilization process. According to the agreement reached by the five Central American countries at the Tegucigalpa summit in August this year, the more than 10,000 Nicaraguan anti-government forces currently stationed in Honduras must be demobilized by December 5 this year. However, so far, the demobilization plan has made no progress, and armed clashes between the two sides have occurred from time to time, to the extent that the Nicaraguan government announced the cancellation of the unilateral ceasefire that had been in effect for 19 months at the beginning of this month. The military leader of the Nicaraguan anti-government forces, Bermúdez, accused the government's demobilization plan of being a plot to force them to surrender. Due to the breakdown of the talks, the Nicaraguan government has indicated that it will not rule out the possibility of a military solution to the anti-government forces.

In recent times, the various countries of Central America have been busy with their internal affairs. El Salvador has just experienced an unprecedented battle, Guatemala is busy dealing with the guerrillas; Honduras is holding elections; Costa Rica is preparing for next year's elections. At present, not to mention convening an emergency summit of leaders, it is difficult to hold the summit of leaders scheduled for December 8 this year in Nicaragua as decided by the previous summit.

### 同反政府武装谈判破裂　尼要求召开中美洲首脑紧急会议

　　同反政府武装谈判破裂
　　尼要求召开中美洲首脑紧急会议
    本报墨西哥城11月23日电　记者郭伟成报道：尼加拉瓜要求召开中美洲首脑紧急会议，讨论如期遣散尼加拉瓜反政府武装问题的建议，今天被洪都拉斯与哥斯达黎加拒绝。
    据墨西哥电视台报道：尼加拉瓜政府与反政府武装在华盛顿美洲国家组织总部举行的谈判昨天破裂，双方未能就遣散进程达成任何协议。根据中美洲5国首脑今年8月在特拉会议达成的协议规定，目前驻扎在洪都拉斯境内的1万余名尼加拉瓜反政府武装必须在今年12月5日执行遣散。但是，迄今为止，遣散计划毫无进展，双方武装摩擦倒时有发生，以至于尼加拉瓜政府在本月初宣布取消已经持续19个月的“单方面停火”。尼加拉瓜反政府武装军事领导人贝穆德斯指责政府提出的遣散计划是迫使他们投降。由于谈判破裂，尼加拉瓜政府已表示不排除武力解决反政府武装的可能性。
    最近以来，中美洲各国都忙于本国内部事务。萨尔瓦多刚刚经历一场空前的战事，危地马拉也忙于对付游击队；洪都拉斯正在进行大选；哥斯达黎加准备明年的大选。目前，不要说召开首脑紧急会议，就是按上次首脑会议决议应于今年12月8日在尼加拉瓜召开的首脑会议也很难实现。
