Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuqing on Li Peng's Visit to Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal
Promoting Friendly Cooperation with the Three Countries and Contributing to Peace and Stability in South Asia

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 10 (Reporters Yang Zidi, News Intern Zhou Qun) Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuqing said in an interview with this agency's reporters today that Premier Li Peng's upcoming official friendly visits to Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the Kingdom of Nepal will not only help promote the further development of friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the three countries but also contribute to peace and stability in South Asia.

Liu Shuqing said that China's relations with Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal have always been good and smooth. In a word, there is only friendship and no fundamental conflicts of interest.

In the political sphere, China's relations with the three countries are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, characterized by sincerity, friendship, equality, mutual respect, and mutual benefit. This is a model of inter-state relations. Over the years, leaders of China and the three countries have frequently visited each other. In February, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto visited China, President H.M. Ershad visited China five times, and King Birendra visited China six times. Chinese Chairman Li Xiannian and other leaders have also visited the three countries. All these visits have strongly promoted the development of bilateral friendly relations and deepened mutual understanding and trust. China does not interfere in the internal affairs of Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal, and the three countries do not interfere in China's internal affairs. In international affairs, China and the three countries have always supported each other and cooperated closely.

In the economic sphere, the governments of China and the three countries have actively worked to develop cooperation in various forms such as economics, trade, contracting, and labor services. Through bilateral cooperation between China and the three countries, the China-Pakistan Friendship Highway (Karakoram Highway), China-Bangladesh Friendship Bridge, China-Nepal Friendship Highway, and other large and medium-sized engineering projects have been successfully completed. At the same time, bilateral trade between China and the three countries has continued to develop. In 1988, the total trade volume between China and Pakistan reached $469 million, between China and Bangladesh reached $130 million, and between China and Nepal reached $1.74 million. In addition, cooperation in contracting, labor services, and technical consulting between China and the three countries has made significant progress, and cultural, scientific, and health exchanges have continued to expand.

Liu Shuqing said that the Chinese government and people highly value the friendship with the aforementioned three countries. Continuously consolidating and developing this friendship is China's established policy. During Premier Li Peng's visit to the three countries, in addition to exchanging views with the leaders of the three countries on bilateral relations and international issues of common concern, he will also introduce the domestic situation and foreign policies of each other.

Liu Shuqing said that Premier Li Peng's visit to the three South Asian countries is an important visit. Therefore, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin will accompany Premier Li Peng on the visit. This also shows that China attaches great importance to friendship and cooperation with South Asian countries.

Liu Shuqing expressed his belief that through Premier Li Peng's visit to South Asia, cooperation between China and the three countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields will be further strengthened, and the friendship between the peoples of China and the three countries will reach a new level.

Liu Shuqing said that Premier Li Peng's visit to the three South Asian countries is the first visit by a Chinese leader after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. This shows that the domestic situation in China is stable and also reflects that China has not changed its foreign policy. He said that China supports the maintenance of peace and stability in South Asia, supports the development of regional cooperation among South Asian countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and supports these countries in getting along with each other on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    外交部副部长刘述卿谈李鹏出访巴、孟、尼
    促进我同三国友好合作关系  有利于南亚地区和平与稳定
    新华社北京十一月十日电　（记者杨子迪、新闻实习生周群）外交部副部长刘述卿今天在接受本社记者采访时说，李鹏总理即将对巴基斯坦、孟加拉国和尼泊尔王国的正式友好访问不仅有助于促进中国同三国的睦邻友好和互利合作关系的进一步发展，而且也有利于南亚地区的和平与稳定。
    刘述卿说，中国同巴、孟、尼三国关系一直发展得很好，很顺利。用一句话概括，就是只有友谊，没有根本利害冲突。
    在政治方面，中国同三国的关系建立在和平共处五项原则基础之上，真诚友好，完全平等，互相尊重，互利合作，是国与国关系的典范。多年来，中国同三国领导人互访频繁。今年二月贝·布托总理访问中国，艾尔沙德总统先后五次访华，比兰德拉国王曾六次访华。中国李先念主席和其他多位领导人也曾访问巴、孟、尼三国。所有这些访问有力地推动了双边友好关系的发展，加深了相互了解和信任。中国不干涉巴、孟、尼的内政，巴、孟、尼三国也不干涉中国的内政。在国际事务中，中国与三国一贯相互支持，密切合作。
    在经济方面，中国和巴、孟、尼三国政府积极致力于发展经济、贸易、承包和劳务等多种形式的合作。经过中国与三国的双边合作，顺利地建成了中巴友谊公路（喀喇昆仑公路）、中孟友谊大桥、中尼友谊公路和其他一些大、中型工程项目。与此同时，中国与三国的双边贸易不断发展，一九八八年中巴贸易总额达四点六九亿美元，中孟贸易总额达一点三零亿美元，中尼贸易总额达一千七百四十万美元。此外，中国与三国在承包、劳务合作和技术咨询方面的合作也有长足进展，文化、科技、卫生交流不断扩大。
    刘述卿说，中国政府和人民十分珍视同上述三国的友谊。不断巩固和发展这一友谊，是中国的既定政策。李鹏总理这次对三国进行访问时，除了同三国领导人就双边关系和共同关心的国际问题交换意见外，还将相互介绍各自国内情况和对外政策。
    刘述卿说，李鹏总理这次对南亚三国的访问是一次重要的访问，因此，外交部长钱其琛和经贸部部长郑拓彬等将陪同李鹏总理出访。这也表明中国十分重视同南亚国家的友谊和合作。
    刘述卿表示相信，通过李鹏总理此次南亚之行，中国同巴、孟、尼三国在政治、经济、文化等各个领域的合作必将得到进一步加强，中国与三国人民的友谊必将提高到一个新的水平。
    刘述卿说，李鹏总理这次对南亚三国的访问是平息反革命暴乱后中国领导人的第一次出访。这表明，中国国内局势稳定，同时也反映出中国没有改变自己的外交政策。他说，中国支持南亚地区保持和平与稳定，支持南亚各国在平等互利的基础上发展区域合作，支持这些国家在和平共处五项原则的基础上友好相处。
