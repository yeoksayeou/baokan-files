Young Master Zhang Wendi Defeats Yamae Takashi Again
China Leads 3-1 in the Fourth Round of the Sino-Japanese Go Tournament

Our reporter in Hangzhou, 6 November 1989: Yamae Takashi, the Japanese Go player who gained fame a year ago by defeating Nie Weiping, today lost to Nie's disciple, Zhang Wendi. Zhang Wendi narrowly won the fourth match of the fifth Sino-Japanese Go Tournament with a lead of 1/4 point.

Playing with white stones, Zhang Wendi forced Yamae to abandon his favored Chinese style of opening. During the mid-game, Zhang frequently employed wild tactics. By noon, after 61 moves, the board was roughly divided between black and white.

At 1 PM, the game resumed. White's moves were forceful, and the advantage on the board was clear. However, as the game entered the endgame, Yamae, known as the "Diamond of Central Japan," made a fierce comeback. White's endgame suffered significant losses, and the situation became confusing. In the final moments, Yamae made a mistake in the endgame, effectively giving away a point. Zhang Wendi secured the final victory.

After four rounds, China leads 3-1. The fifth and sixth rounds will be held from 18 to 20 December in Singapore. This is the first time the Sino-Japanese Go Tournament has been held in a third country.

    小将张文东又胜羽根泰正
    中日围棋擂台赛我三比一领先
    本报杭州11月6日电　一年前因战胜聂卫平而名声大噪的日本羽根泰正九段今天败在了聂卫平的徒弟张文东手下。张文东以1／4子的微弱优势幸运地赢得了第五届中日围棋擂台赛第4场比赛的胜利。
    执白后走的张文东开局先是迫使羽根舍弃其擅长的中国流布局，继而在中盘战中多次施展野战招法。至中午12点封盘，双方共弈61手。盘面黑白大致形成割据之势。
    下午1点开盘续弈，白棋招法硬朗，盘面优势明显，但在进入官子阶段时，素有日本中部钻石之称的羽根泰正急起直追，白棋官子大损，局势顿时扑朔迷离。羽根泰正在最后关头收官失误，白送对方一目棋。张文东取得了最后的胜利。
    本届擂台赛已过4轮，中方以3∶1领先。第五、六轮比赛将于12月18日至20日在新加坡举行。这是中日围棋擂台赛首次移师第三国比赛。
