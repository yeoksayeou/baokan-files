In late May, the Chinese mainland experienced an unprecedented turmoil. Some "foreigners" left China and did not return for a long time. However, Chebaro arrived in China for the second time in late July. He emotionally told the Chinese staff, "Originally, I could have not come. The boss sent me to Egypt. But I feel that China is still the best. I have developed feelings with you all. My work here is not yet completed. How could I not come back?"

Chebaro is 46 years old and of Italian nationality.

On July 1, 1988, he bid farewell to the picturesque scenery of Genoa and first arrived at the construction site of the Huadian Nantong Power Plant, located by the Yangtze River, to take up the position of "Commissioning Manager" for the construction of the state key project Huadian Nantong Power Plant. In over 300 days and nights, Chebaro closely cooperated with the Chinese staff, working together harmoniously, and finally ensured that the 13 billion yuan investment in this large-scale Sino-foreign joint venture's Unit 1 was handed over for trial operation on September 8. The Nantong Municipal Government and Huadian Nantong Company both awarded him the honorary title of "Excellent Expert." Subsequently, the State Bureau of Foreign Experts invited him, along with his wife, to Beijing as a representative of foreign experts to attend the reception for the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation held by the State Council.

When he first arrived at the construction site, a pile of thorny problems lay before him: the equipment and materials supplied by the foreign party were delayed again and again, and the design drawings and data from the foreign party were revised repeatedly, causing the installation and commissioning to be repeatedly hindered. The project was facing a worrying situation, and the command department was anxious. Chebaro's mood was also very heavy. This "old foreigner," who had worked on the commissioning of 10 power plant projects, told the Chinese staff, "Your difficulties are our difficulties. Let's work together."

One morning last year, during the alkali washing of the condenser, the Chinese staff discovered that the sewage pump provided by the foreign party had a low lift, and the wastewater could not be discharged. They immediately invited Chebaro to the site for a "consultation." He skillfully performed a reverse pump test and "diagnosed" that the sewage pump did not meet the design requirements. Chebaro thought: if this problem is not solved quickly, it will affect the timely cleaning of the boiler front system. He gave up his lunch break, checked the drawings, and consulted the materials, finally working with the Chinese side to come up with a solution. The next day, the sewage pump motor sang a joyful tune, and the sewage was successfully discharged.

Those who know the inside story say that the role of the "Commissioning Manager" is crucial. The quality of the equipment commissioning directly affects the power generation of the unit. Chebaro deeply felt the weight of his responsibility. For two 350,000-kilowatt units, one day earlier in power generation could create a profit of 200,000 yuan, and one day later in commissioning would require paying 400,000 yuan in interest! Therefore, he poured his heart of friendly cooperation into the intricate work.

At the end of 1988, when the 1st boiler was about to be ignited, Chebaro caught a cold with a high fever, dizziness, and a body that felt like it had fallen apart. To avoid affecting the work, he dragged his weak legs to the main control room and insisted on arranging the thermal control commissioning plan.

"You're sick. You should take some medicine and rest," many people advised him.

"It's okay. The boiler burners are not adjusted yet, and the automatic ignition keeps failing. I can't rest!" Chebaro shook his head in response.

That day, he worked until the sky was filled with stars before leaving the site.

Due to the intense work, Chebaro almost always worked overtime, often forgetting to eat. The hotel staff had to send meals to the site. He ate while working, often working until late at night, sometimes even all night, and did not rest on weekends or holidays.

On December 25, 1988, it was the traditional holiday of the Western world—Christmas. He had planned to return home for a vacation, but just before leaving, Unit 1 encountered several problems during commissioning. He gave up the opportunity to return home and reunite with his family and friends, not only staying himself but also persuading his colleagues to stay. With the help and guidance of the experts, the obstacles were quickly removed, and Unit 1 conducted its first trial power generation!

Chebaro is a genuine "old foreigner," but in the construction of the Huadian Nantong Power Plant project, he worked with the attitude of a "host." Whenever he saw a screw or a part on the ground, he would always pick it up and put it back in the toolbox. He was meticulous in his work, even considering for the Chinese side the best time to invite experts of various professions to China, thus saving the project over 300,000 US dollars in foreign expert hiring fees.

The contract clearly stipulates that foreign experts working overtime will receive double pay. It is reasonable to take it, but he never asked for it. He said, "Friendship is eternal, money is not!"

Someone did not understand and asked him, "Why do you work so hard?"

"Work, you have to do it well! This is our creed!" Chebaro replied.

"It's work, you have to do it well!" This belief inspired Chebaro, making him, on the land of a foreign country, in the arduous construction of the project, silently weave a wreath of Sino-Italian friendly cooperation with his actions.

    他从热那亚来
    ——记意大利专家切巴罗
      王忠南
    5月下旬，中华大地经历了一场空前的风波。一些“老外”撤离中国后迟迟不返。然而，切巴罗却于7月下旬第二次踏上了中国的国土。他深情地对中方人员说：“本来，我可以不来了，老板派我去埃及。但我觉得还是中国好。我和你们有了感情，我在这里的事业还未完成，我怎么能不来呢！”
    切巴罗46岁，意大利籍。
    1988年7月1日，他辞别旖旎的热那亚风光，第一次来到地处扬子江畔的华能南通电厂工地，应聘担任国家重点工程华能南通电厂建设的“调试经理”。在300多个日日夜夜里，切巴罗与中方人员密切配合，友好合作，终于使这座投资达13亿元的大型中外合资企业的1号机组于9月8日移交试生产。南通市政府和华能南通分公司分别授予他“优秀专家”的荣誉称号。随后，国家外国专家局又邀请他以外国专家代表的身份偕夫人赴京参加国务院举行的建国40周年招待会。
    记得初到工地时，摆在他面前的是一大堆棘手的问题：外方供应的设备材料一拖再拖，外方设计的图纸资料一改再改，致使安装调试屡屡受挫……工程面临着令人担忧的困境，工程指挥部上下心急火燎。切巴罗的心情也十分沉重。这位搞过10家电厂工程调试的“老外”对中方人员说：“你们的困难就是我们的困难，让我们一起干吧”。
    去年的一天上午，中方人员在凝汽器碱洗时，发现国外提供的排污泵扬程小，废水排不出去。当即约请切巴罗赴现场“会诊”。他动作娴熟地作了倒泵试验，“诊断”出排污泵达不到设计要求。切巴罗心想：如不尽快解决，将影响炉前系统的按时清洗。他放弃午间休息，翻图纸，查资料，终于和中方一起研究出了解决办法。翌日，排污泵马达唱起了欢歌，排污成功了。
    熟知内情的人都说，“调试经理”是一个至关重要的角色，设备调试的好坏，直接影响机组发电。切巴罗深感肩头的责任重大。两台35万千瓦机组，早一天发电，可创利润20万元，迟一天上马，需付利息40万元！为此，他将自己友好合作的心，融进了千头万绪的工作中。
    1988年底，正当1号炉即将点火的紧张时刻，切巴罗感冒发高烧，头晕目眩，浑身像散了架似的，为了不影响工作，他硬是拖着软绵绵的双腿来到主控室，坚持安排热控调试方案。
    “你病了，还是吃点药休息休息吧！”不少人关心地劝他。
      “没关系，锅炉燃烧器还没调好，自动点火老点不着，我不能休息！”切巴罗摇了摇头回答。
    那天，他一直忙到天空布满了星星才离开现场。
    由于工作紧张，切巴罗几乎天天加班，许多时候忘了吃饭，宾馆的服务员只好将饭送到现场。他边吃边干，一干就到深夜，甚至通宵，连星期天、节假日也不休息。
    1988年12月25日，是西方人的传统节日——圣诞节。他本来准备回国度假的，谁知，临走前，1号机组调试中接连发生了问题。他放弃了回国与亲友团聚的机会，不但自己留了下来，还劝说他的同事们也留了下来。在专家们的帮助和指导下，障碍很快排除了，1号机组进行了首次试发电！
    切巴罗是地地道道的“老外”，但是在华能南通电厂工程的建设中，他却是在以
  “主人”的态度去工作。只要看见地上有一颗螺丝，一只零件，他总要拣起来，放回工具箱中。他作事周到仔细，连什么时间聘请什么专业的专家来华比较适宜，都替中方考虑到了，从而为工程节省外国专家聘用费30多万美元。
    合同上明文规定，外国专家加班加点工作，日薪加倍。拿，合情合理，可他从不伸手要。他说：“友谊是永存的，金钱不是永存的！”
    有人不理解，问他：“你这样干，图啥？”
      “工作嘛，就得好好干！这是我们的信条！”切巴罗答道。
      “工作就得好好干！”正是这种信念，鼓舞着切巴罗，使他在异国的大地上，在艰苦的工程建设中，用自己的行动，默默地编织着中意友好合作的花环。
