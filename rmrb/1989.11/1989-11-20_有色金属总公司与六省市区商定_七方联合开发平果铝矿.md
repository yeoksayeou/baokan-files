The Pingguo aluminum resources in Guangxi, which have been praised by domestic and foreign experts, will end their dormant state and benefit humanity. A memorandum recently signed by representatives from the China Nonferrous Metals Corporation, Guangxi, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Guangzhou and Shenzhen indicates that the seven parties have decided to jointly invest in the development of the Pingguo aluminum mine.

The Pingguo aluminum mine is located in the western region of Guangxi, with an estimated reserve of 150 million tons. It has the characteristics of large reserves, high grade, and surface mining, making it easy to exploit.

The first phase of the Pingguo aluminum mine project is designed to produce 300,000 tons of alumina, 100,000 tons of electrolytic aluminum, and 250,000 kilowatts of electricity annually. The estimated investment is 2.314 billion yuan. The joint investment by the seven parties will solve the funding problem. The construction period for the first phase is expected to be four years.
