In mid-autumn, the cotton-producing county of Sheyang in Jiangsu Province is filled with mountains of cotton. We visited dozens of cotton collection stations across the county and heard nothing but praise.

At the Xingqiao Cotton Collection Station, we met the manager of the Xingqiao Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Gong Xijin. Although he had been busy since 2 a.m. until 5 p.m., he showed no signs of fatigue. He took the example of Yuezhong Village and listed a series of fresh developments:

In the village, 385 cotton growers sold 38,000 kilograms of lint cotton in one day, with 97% being first-grade cotton. They immediately received over 250,000 yuan in cash. The farmers in the fourth group, Qi Conghuo, sold 1,980 yuan worth of cotton in one go. To ensure a good order for cotton collection, the village committee deputy secretary, Qi Conghong, came to the collection station and worked there for a whole day. At this point, Old Gong took out a letter of commendation from the supply and marketing cooperative from the room, which read:

Yuezhong Village Committee: The cotton grower Qi Yuhong from your village's third group sold cotton at our station. He should have received 103.2 yuan, but our staff mistakenly gave him 1,003.2 yuan. Before the person issuing the payment noticed the mistake, he returned the extra 900 yuan. Please commend him for his noble thoughts and moral character...

The Huangxing Cotton Collection Station has done an outstanding job in serving the cotton growers. At the collection station, they have set up a rest room for the cotton growers, providing hot food, tea, and other items such as bicycle pumps, newspapers, and commonly used medicines. Additionally, they have set up special windows for the elderly, the weak, the disabled, military families, and teachers. Zhang Jinyuan, who has been a cotton inspector for over 30 years, is very skilled at grading cotton. However, he does not rely on his old experience and strictly follows the upper-level regulations requiring a sampling rate of 50% and a retention rate of 50%. If any cotton grower is not satisfied with the visual inspection, Zhang Jinyuan will patiently use the machine to show them. On the Huangxing cotton collection site, when farmers mention Zhang Jinyuan, they all give him a thumbs up.

    收花站上的叫好声
    顾长清
    金秋十月，盛产棉花的江苏省射阳县到处是堆积如山的棉花。我们访问了全县数十个收花站，听到的是一片叫好声。
    来到兴桥收花站，正遇上兴桥供销站经理龚锡刚。他虽从凌晨两点一直忙碌到下午五点，却一点也看不出倦色。他以跃中村为例，一口气向我们说出了一串新鲜事：
    全村三百八十五个植棉户，一天就售皮棉三点八万公斤，百分之九十七是一级棉，一下子领走现金二十五万多元。四组棉农祁从火一次出售了一千九百八十元的棉花。为保证有个好的收花秩序，村委会副主任祁从宏来到收花站，帮助工作了整整一天。说到这里，老龚又从房里拿出一张供销站写来的表扬信，上面写道：
    跃中村民委员会：你村三组棉农祁玉洪到我站出售棉花，他应得一百零三元二角，我站负责发款的同志错给为一千零三元二角。在发款人还没有发觉错了的时候，他就把多给的九百元送来了，请你们对他这种高尚的思想品德给予表扬……
    黄兴收花站在为棉农服务方面做得很突出。在收花站，他们为棉农开辟了休息室，供应熟食品、茶水，还准备了自行车打气筒、报刊、常用药品等。另外，他们还增设了老弱病残、军烈属、教师专售窗口。当了三十多年棉检员的张锦元，品测棉花等级的能力很强，但他决不凭老经验办事，严格执行上级规定的试轧率达百分之五十，留样率达百分之五十的要求。哪个棉农对眼测不放心，张锦元就不厌其烦地用机轧给他看。在黄兴收花场上，提到张锦元，棉农们都翘大拇指。
