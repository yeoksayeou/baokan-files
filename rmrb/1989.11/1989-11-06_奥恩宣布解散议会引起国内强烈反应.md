Aoun Announces Dissolution of Parliament Sparks Strong Domestic Reaction

BEIRUT, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) — According to local radio broadcasts, the decision by Lebanese Christian leader Michel Aoun to dissolve the parliament on the morning of November 4 sparked strong reactions in Beirut.

Lebanese Muslim Deputy Prime Minister Hussein Husseini said that Aoun's decision was "illegal" and "invalid," and that "no matter what happens, it will not affect the peace process."

George Saadah, the chairman of the Christian Lebanese Front, believed that Aoun's decision was "unconstitutional," and that the only role of Aoun's government was to prepare for the presidential election.

Many Lebanese parliamentarians in Beirut condemned Aoun's decision, saying it had "no legal basis." They expressed their determination to complete the mission of electing a new president.

Meanwhile, many Christians in East Beirut demonstrated in front of the presidential palace, supporting Aoun's stance and criticizing the Taif Agreement reached by Lebanese parliamentarians last month.

Aoun told the demonstrators that they must uphold national sovereignty and attacked some parliamentarians who attempted to hold a parliamentary session in the "Syrian-occupied area." He said, "A president elected outside the free territory is an agent."

In addition, in the past two days, at least three parliamentarians have been attacked at their homes or offices in Beirut. It is believed that this is retaliation for their support of the Taif Agreement.

BEIRUT, Nov. 5 (Xinhua) — Thirty Lebanese parliamentarians left Paris this morning on two Boeing 707 aircraft to return to Beirut, where they will participate in the election of the new Lebanese president scheduled for today.

    奥恩宣布解散议会引起国内强烈反应
    新华社贝鲁特11月4日电　据此间电台广播说，黎巴嫩基督教派领导人奥恩4日早上宣布的将解散议会的决定在贝鲁特引起强烈反应。
    黎穆斯林代总理胡斯说，奥恩的决定是“非法的”、“无效的”，“无论发生了什么，都不会影响和平进程”。
    基督教黎巴嫩阵线主席乔治·萨达赫认为，奥恩的决定是“不符合宪法的”，奥恩政府的唯一作用就是为总统选举作准备。
    在贝鲁特的许多黎议员谴责奥恩的决定，说它“没有法律依据”。他们表示，决心要完成选举出一位新总统的使命。
    与此同时，在东贝鲁特的许多基督教人士在总统府前示威，支持奥恩的立场，指责黎议员上月达成的塔伊夫协议。
    奥恩对示威群众说，要坚持国家的主权，并攻击一些议员企图在“叙利亚占领区”举行议会会议。他说“一个在自由领土以外选举出来的总统是一个代理人”。
    此外，最近两天，至少有3名议员在贝鲁特的住宅或办公室遭到袭击。据认为，这是因他们赞成塔伊夫协议而遭到的报复。
    本报巴黎11月5日电　30名黎巴嫩议员今天上午分乘两架波音707专机离开巴黎返回贝鲁特，参加定于今天举行的黎巴嫩新总统的选举。
