China's representative calls for addressing the root causes of the refugee problem
Worldwide refugees reach 14 million, China hosts nearly 300,000

	NEW YORK, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Ding Yuanhong recently spoke at the 44th UN General Assembly's Third Committee on the global refugee problem, stating that the primary causes of the current worldwide refugee issue are colonialism, racism, and foreign invasion and occupation.

	He said that refugees from Southern Africa, Palestine, Cambodia, and Afghanistan are prime examples of this.

	Ding Yuanhong mentioned that other factors, such as economic imbalances, the wealth disparity between the Global South and North, and disputes between countries, also contribute to the refugee problem.

	He emphasized that to eliminate the refugee phenomenon, in addition to international protection and material assistance for refugees, it is crucial to stop racism, colonialism, and aggression against other countries. In international relations, the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence must be adhered to. This is a respect for human rights, including the right to self-determination, and the fundamental way to solve the global refugee problem.

	Ding Yuanhong said that globally, the refugee situation is worsening, with the number of refugees reaching 14 million. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is facing a severe financial crisis and will have a deficit of $40 million this year.

	Ding Yuanhong said that the majority of refugees worldwide reside in developing countries. Without the efforts, sacrifices, and contributions of these countries, the plight of refugees around the world would be unimaginable. Therefore, it is essential to emphasize the importance of providing development aid to developing countries for refugees. Ding Yuanhong said that China has already accepted and sheltered nearly 300,000 refugees. The Chinese government will continue to work with the international community to contribute to solving the refugee problem.

　　我代表呼吁从根本上解决难民问题
　　世界难民达一千四百万中国接纳近三十万
    新华社联合国电　（记者苏元椿）中国代表丁原洪大使最近在第44届联大三委关于世界难民问题讨论时指出，当今世界的难民问题主要是由于殖民主义、种族主义和外国侵略和占领造成的。
    他说，南部非洲、巴勒斯坦、柬埔寨和阿富汗难民等都是这样的例子。
    丁原洪说，还有一些其它原因，诸如经济发展不平衡；南北贫富悬殊，以及国与国之间的一些争端等也是造成难民问题的原因。
    他指出，要消除难民现象，除了国际社会要对难民提供国际保护和提供物质援助之外，至关重要的是要促使有关方面停止种族主义、殖民主义和对别国的侵略，在国际关系中遵循互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处五项原则。这是对包括民族自决权在内的人权的尊重，也是解决世界难民问题的根本出路。
    丁原洪说，从世界范围看，难民形势进一步恶化，难民人数已增至1400万，联合国高级难民署遇到严重财政危机，今年将出现4000万美元的赤字。
    丁原洪说，世界上绝大多数难民都居住在发展中国家，没有这些国家的努力、牺牲和贡献，世界难民的处境是无法想象的。因此，必须强调向发展中国家提供难民发展援助的重要性。丁原洪说，中国已经接纳了和收容了近30万难民。中国政府将一如既往，和国际社会一起，为解决难民问题作出贡献。
