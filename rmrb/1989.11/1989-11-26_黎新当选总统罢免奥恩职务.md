Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, November 25th.

Newly elected Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, just eight hours after taking office, issued a statement today announcing the dismissal of interim military government leader Michel Aoun.

Aoun was appointed by former President Amin Gemayel in September 1988 to lead the interim military government. Both Aoun and Hrawi belong to the Maronite Christian sect.

Upon learning of his dismissal, Aoun issued a statement declaring that Hrawi, like Muawad, was elected under Syrian occupation and was therefore unconstitutional.

　　黎新当选总统罢免奥恩职务
    新华社贝鲁特11月25日电　新当选的黎巴嫩总统伊莱亚斯·赫拉维在就任8小时后于今天凌景发表一份公告，宣布解除临时军政府领导人奥恩的职务。
    奥恩是1988年9月由前总统阿明·杰马耶勒任命为临时军政府领导人的。他和赫拉维同属基督教马龙派。
    奥恩在得知他被罢免的消息后发表一项声明称，赫拉维同穆阿瓦德一样都是在叙利亚的占领下选出来的，都是违宪的。
