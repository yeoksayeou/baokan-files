For a long time, the management system of highway administrative units has severely constrained the initiative of the people, leading to the phenomenon of units relying on the state's big pot of food and individuals relying on the collective's big pot of food. This has resulted in a dispersed workforce and lazy individuals, making highway construction lack intrinsic vitality and dynamism. How can we break free from this predicament? The key is to thoroughly reform the operational mechanism of highway administrative units that rely on the big pot of food and actively promote enterprise management.

Taking the Dalian Municipal Highway Management Bureau as an example, before 1987, there were eight engineering construction teams, seven of which were public welfare units and one was a collective enterprise. The annual engineering construction output value was less than 300 million yuan. Because they were public welfare units, whether they worked hard or not made no difference, and about half of the annual construction tasks were completed by outsourcing. Since 1987, we have focused on eliminating the iron rice bowl and not relying on the big pot of food, insisting on deepening the reform of highway construction teams. Over the past two years, we have transformed all seven public welfare construction teams into enterprises, implementing independent accounting and self-balancing profits and losses. The practice over the past two years has shown that the transformation of highway construction teams from public welfare to enterprises has been very effective. The direct highway engineering company of the bureau could only undertake engineering tasks worth over 100 million yuan in previous years, and the engineering frontline mainly relied on hiring seasonal peasant workers. Most of the company's employees were managerial and logistical personnel who did not want to do hard work and rarely undertook the most arduous tasks on the frontline. After the transformation, in 1987, the company undertook the road surface construction task of the Shenyang-Dalian Expressway, completely relying on its own strength to create an output value of over 500 million yuan; in 1988, it undertook a 22-kilometer road surface construction task with an output value of nearly 1,000 million yuan. Completing such a large amount of engineering work was unthinkable before the transformation. The planned engineering tasks in various counties (cities and districts) in the city were the most in history in 1987, and in 1988, they increased by 34% compared to 1987. Under the previous circumstances, it would have been difficult to complete the planned engineering tasks. However, after the transformation, the various companies were still not satisfied with the existing tasks and actively undertook external engineering tasks worth 65 million yuan.

At the same time, the sense of enterprise has been strengthened, and attention has been paid to meticulous management. The Jinzhou County Highway Engineering Company insists on starting from the smallest details, not wasting a single penny, and strictly manages travel expenses, office car expenses, telephone expenses, water and electricity expenses, and low-value consumables, practicing thrift and saving, saving more than half compared to the same period before the transformation; the Lushunkou District Highway Engineering Company has only four part-time managers, no full-time personnel, and all are involved in the production frontline. The two managers, both president and vice-president, live and work on the construction site, sharing weal and woe with the employees.

Practice has proven that the earlier the highway system eliminates the iron rice bowl and the big pot of food, the earlier the highway cause will be full of vitality and dynamism.

　　积极推行公路企业化管理
　　大连市公路管理处处长　孙心有
    长期以来，公路系统事业单位的管理体制，严重束缚了人们积极性的发挥，导致了单位吃国家大锅饭、个人吃集体大锅饭，队伍养散了，人养懒了，使公路建设缺乏内在的生机和活力。怎样才能迈出这令人困扰的窘境？就是要彻底改公路事业单位大锅饭的经营机制，积极推行企业化管理。
    以我们大连市公路管理处为例，1987年以前共有八个工程施工队，其中七个施工队是全民事业性质，一个是集体企业。每年工程施工产值不足三千万元。由于是事业单位性质，干多干少一个样，每年有一半左右的施工任务靠外委完成。1987年以来，我们围绕端掉铁饭碗，不吃大锅饭，坚持深化公路施工队伍改革，两年来先后将七个事业性质的施工队全部改为企业，实行独立核算、自负盈亏，经过两年的实践证明，公路施工队事业改企业后效果显著。处直公路工程公司前些年每年只能承担一百多万元的工程任务，而且工程一线多是靠招用农民季节工，本公司职工多是甩手的管理人员和后勤人员，怕苦怕累，很少承担一线最苦最累的工作。改企业后，1987年承担沈大高速公路路面施工任务，完全靠自己的力量创产值达500多万元；1988年又承担22公里的路面施工任务，产值近一千万元。完成这么大的工程量，在改企业前是连想也不敢想的。全市各县（市）区计划内工程任务，1987年就是历史上最多的一年，而1988年又比1987年增加了34％，按以往情况定计划内的工程任务就难以完成。而改企业后，各公司仍不满足已有的任务，还积极对外承揽工程达650万元。
    同时，增强了经营观念，注意精打细算。新金县公路工程公司坚持从点滴入手，不乱花一分钱，对差旅费、办公用车费、电话费、水电费、低值易耗品等坚持严格管理，勤俭节约，比改企业前同期节省一半以上；旅顺口区公路工程公司，仅设四名兼职管理人员，没有脱产人员，都深入生产一线，两名正副经理吃住在工地，与职工同甘共苦。
    实践证明，公路系统早一天端掉铁饭碗大锅饭，公路事业就会早一天充满生机和活力。
