Unraveling the Debt Chain Requires Linking People
—Thoughts on Clearing Inter-Enterprise Arrears (Part II)

    By Pan Gang, Reporter of People's Daily

    How to untangle the debt chain between enterprises has become an urgent matter for the entire economy. Currently, many places and enterprises, including some specialized banks, are hoping for relief from the state's monetary policy.

    Relaxing monetary policy to clear arrears is simple, but if more money is issued, there must be corresponding goods to back it up. As Premier Li Peng pointed out, China's national income has been over-distributed for many years. Issuing more money will only exacerbate inflation.

    Unraveling the debt chain requires linking people. From the perspective of the current total amount of funds nationwide, money is not scarce. By the end of September, the total outstanding loans of all banks nationwide had reached 1115.25 billion yuan, an increase of 60.1 billion yuan from the beginning of the year. Many examples also prove that, under the premise of the state tightening monetary policy and not increasing or minimally increasing loans, as long as the understanding is clear and proactive efforts are made, various levels of government, banks, and enterprises can take effective actions to clear arrears.

    The two major obstacles to unraveling the debt chain are the inability to significantly increase loans and regional interests. Since June this year, Tongchuan City in Shaanxi Province has organized the city's grain system enterprises to concentrate on clearing arrears, untangling the debt chain of 28 enterprises totaling 18.02 million yuan. The loan scale did not increase, and 3.9 million yuan in bank loans were actually recovered. The provincial government and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Heilongjiang Province took the lead in organizing inter-regional "mutual clearing of arrears" within the province. In just two months, 86 inter-regional arrears were resolved. Recently, the head office of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China organized the first nationwide clearing of arrears among 36 city branches, helping 5,000 enterprises nationwide clear 5.2 billion yuan in arrears, achieving a high efficiency of activating 4 yuan for every 1 yuan invested.

    Banks assisting in clearing arrears can achieve significant results, but this is ultimately a temporary measure. Many entrepreneurs are increasingly feeling that to prevent the recurrence of cleared arrears and to break free from financial constraints, the key is to improve the economic efficiency of enterprises and increase labor productivity.

    Many people are worried about the nationwide accumulation of finished products, but a recent commodity resource adjustment conference held in Dalian successfully traded 670 million yuan worth of goods, with the transaction amount of originally flat or stagnant goods exceeding the expected 5-6 times. This shows that the accumulation of finished products is both a burden of enterprise debt and a potential for clearing arrears. As long as we seize the opportunity, vigorously promote sales, and focus on increasing varieties, improving quality, and reducing costs, it is possible to open up a new path to enhance the enterprise's ability to supplement funds.

    The poor economic performance of industrial enterprises is a notable problem among the eight key indicators of the national economy for the first three quarters. From January to September, the growth rate of labor productivity of industrial enterprises was only 2.7%, and the profit and tax generated by every 100 yuan of funds decreased from 23.4 yuan last year to 20.1 yuan. However, difficulties and opportunities coexist. Who can say that its existence is not an opportunity for bold entrepreneurs to showcase their talents? As long as we firmly grasp the management of enterprises, it is possible to "struggle" to create some high-efficiency enterprises.

    Of course, for enterprises to break out of their predicament, the active cooperation of relevant departments is also needed. A survey found that currently, the debt chain between enterprises is intertwined with the debt chain between enterprises, banks, and finance. In the Xi'an region, industrial and commercial enterprises currently owe the finance department 60 million yuan, while the finance department owes the bank 1.3 billion yuan; in Liaoning Province, enterprises owe the finance department 1.5 billion yuan, while the finance department also owes the bank 1.5 billion yuan. Enterprises are powerless against this debt chain, and various levels of government and relevant departments should pay sufficient attention and conduct comprehensive treatment.

    "Difficulties overcome lead to a bright future." It can be imagined that when we, through strenuous efforts, overcome the financial difficulties, the production and management level of our enterprises will definitely reach a new level.

### 解“链”还需系“链”人——对清理企业间拖欠货款的思考（下）

    解“链”还需系“链”人
    ——对清理企业间拖欠货款的思考（下）
    本报记者　潘岗
    何以解开企业间的债务链，已成为整个经济发展的当务之急。眼下，不少地方和企业，包括一些专业银行，把希望寄托在国家放松银根上。
    放松银根清欠，自然简单，但票子发多了，后面得有物资作保证。正像李鹏总理指出的那样：我国国民收入超分配已经多年，再多发票子，结果只能是加剧通货膨胀。
    解“链”还需系“链”人。从全国目前资金总量看，钱并不少。到9月底，全国各家银行贷款余额已达11152.5亿元，比年初增加601亿元。不少事例也证明，在国家紧缩银根、不增或少增贷款的前提下，只要认识明确，积极主动，各级政府、银行和企业在清理拖欠中并非无所作为。
    不能过多地增加贷款和地区利益分割是解“链”的最大障碍。今年6月以来，陕西省铜川市组织全市粮食系统企业集中清欠，解开了28户企业的1802万元“债务链”。贷款规模不仅未增加，还净收回银行贷款39万元。黑龙江省政府和省工商银行牵头，在省内地区间“对等清欠”。短短两个月，就有86笔跨地区拖欠款迎刃而解。前不久，工商银行总行首次在全国36城市行间清欠，就帮助全国5000家企业清理拖欠货款52亿元，收到了投入1元搞活4元多的高效益。
    银行协助清欠，可收事半功倍之效，但这毕竟是治标的措施。不少企业家已越来越感受到，要防止前清后欠的出现，摆脱资金紧缺的困扰，关键是要提高企业的经济效益，提高劳动生产率。
    不少人为产成品全国范围积压忧心如焚，可大连市不久前召开的一次清仓挖潜商品物资调节大会，就成交商品6.7亿元，其中原来平销、滞销物资商品成交额超过预计的5—6倍。可见，产成品积压，既是企业负债的包袱，也是企业清欠的潜力。只要我们能抓住时机，大力促销，并在增加花色品种、提高质量、降低成本上下功夫，就有可能闯出一条增强企业补充资金能力的新路子。
    工业企业经济效益不佳，是前三季国民经济八项重要指标中令人注目的难题。1—9月，工业企业全员劳动生产率增幅仅为2.7％，每百元资金提供的利税也由去年的23.4元降为20.1元。然而，难题与机会并存，谁能说它的存在不是给有胆略的企业家提供了施展才干的机会。只要紧紧牵住企业管理这个“牛鼻子”，就有可能“拚”出一些高效益的企业来。
    当然，企业要突出困境，还需要各有关部门的积极配合。有人调查发现，眼下企业间的债务链，与企业、银行、财政间的债务链纵横交错，环环相扣。西安地区工商企业目前欠财政6000万元，财政欠银行1.3亿元；辽宁省企业欠财政15亿元，财政欠银行也是15亿元。对这一债务链，企业无能为力，各级政府和有关部门应引起足够注意，进行综合处理。
      “难关”渡过是“阳关”。可以想见，当我们经过奋力拚搏，渡过资金紧张难关之日，我们企业的生产管理水平，必定会跃上一个新的台阶。
