**Second Automobile Works: From the Mountains to the World**

From a modern perspective, building a car factory in a remote mountain valley seems absurd. The Second Automobile Works (SAW) is well-known both domestically and internationally, yet few people can accurately pinpoint its location. Many people in China mistakenly think it is in Wuhan, while foreigners often assume it is in Beijing.

Foreign visitors to Shiyan in northwestern Hubei Province are invariably amazed: "The Communist Party has built such a modern automobile city in these wild mountains between the Daba Mountains and the Qinling Mountains!"

Shiyan has a population of 240,000, two-thirds of whom are automobile workers and their families. A valley can accommodate one or several factories, and 30 specialized plants are spread over an east-west stretch of 30 kilometers and a north-south width of 8 kilometers. Among the more than 20,000 pieces of equipment, many are of international standards; computers and microelectronics technology are widely used.

In September, the 80,000 SAW employees celebrated the factory's 20th anniversary. Like a young person in the prime of life, SAW has produced 800,000 Dongfeng-brand vehicles in ten years, contributing 3.75 billion yuan in taxes and profits. The fixed assets have doubled from the original investment, turning one SAW into two.

Upon arriving, I immediately noticed that SAW had already begun to move beyond the mountains!

In 1985, when SAW reached a production capacity of 100,000 vehicles, the valley suddenly seemed too cramped. How could a large enterprise be so far from the market and information sources? A dragon cannot be confined to a pond. The first director, Rao Bin, decided to strategically expand outward.

The first foothold was Xiangfan. Overlooking the ancient battlefield of the Three Kingdoms, SAW's Xiangfan base is located on Oil Mill Hill, a high ground that even the famous "Seven Armies Drowned" could not submerge. This is SAW's heavy-duty vehicle and engine base. To welcome the takeoff of China's automobile industry, the largest automobile test field in China is also being built here.

SAW people call this strategic expansion a "triple jump." The third jump is to build the passenger car base in Wuhan. From there, the Golden Waterway of the Yangtze River leads directly to the sea, and automobile products will flow continuously to the world.

If you were given a quiz: "Where is SAW?" Answering "Shiyan" would not get full marks. Today's SAW is no longer just a point on the map. From Shiyan, passing through the Shennongjia Forest, through Xiangfan, and down the Han River to Wuhan, a long corridor of the automobile industry is being formed. SAW will first realize the grand vision of "Rising in Central China."

**From SAW to SAW Group**

The current director, Chen Qingtai, is an enterprising businessman. He often says, "Without reform and opening up, there would be no SAW of today." Ten years of wind and rain, SAW people have been at the forefront of reform.

Ten years ago, at the beginning of the reform, it coincided with the period of adjustment. The state had already invested 1.67 billion yuan, and 700 million yuan more was needed to complete the factory. However, the state was in financial difficulty and could not provide more funds.

Neither could it be stopped nor delayed. Stopping or delaying construction almost meant destruction. At that time, the director Huang Zhengxia was worried, and he and the leadership proposed a reform plan of "seeking policy but not money." That is, the state would not invest more, but would give the enterprise autonomy, allowing SAW to use its after-tax profits, updating and renovation funds, and major repair funds together.

This was a new breakthrough for the planned economy at that time. The plan was approved. The first battle of reform was also a great success. Subsequently, SAW entered a "momentum like breaking bamboo" golden period.

In 1981, SAW was the first to establish a joint venture company, opening up the horizontal cooperation and specialized production. In 1982, following the example of Capital Iron and Steel Company, SAW implemented a profit-sharing contract with the state, basically solving the relationship between the enterprise and the state. In 1983, an import and export company was established, and business agencies were quickly set up in New York, Hamburg, and Hong Kong to prepare for the entry of products into the international market. In 1984, a medium and long-term development plan was formulated, and the future development of the enterprise was considered. In 1986, the state planning was separated, and the power to directly dialogue with relevant state departments was obtained...

Ten years later, SAW has developed from a large factory into a large-scale enterprise group with comprehensive functions of automobile development, production, scientific research, information, sales, and services. There are 287 member factories, covering 28 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, spanning 14 departments, producing more than 300 varieties of products, all of which have achieved profits. The number of employees is 270,000, equivalent to the strength of several "army groups."

The pattern of China's automobile industry, with few large factories, too many small factories, small and complete, scattered, and backward, has begun to be broken by enterprise groups. To fundamentally solve this problem, it ultimately depends on the establishment of enterprise groups. Enterprise groups are not simply the sum of quantities, but the optimization of production factors and the reasonable reconfiguration of existing resources. Among the members of the group, the cooperation of products and technologies has broken through, and it has begun to develop towards economic cooperation and asset integration.

Now, SAW is beginning to move towards a corporate system. Chen Qingtai introduced that the corporate system is divided into three levels: the first level is the corporate headquarters, which is the decision-making layer, the only investment center of the entire group, responsible for formulating business strategies, long-term development plans, determining investment directions, and personnel management. The second level is composed of several professional departments and subsidiaries, which are profit centers responsible for product development and business operations. The third level is the professional factory, which is the basic layer, the cost center, responsible for production management and cost reduction.

**Off-Road Vehicles, Heavy-Duty Trucks, Passenger Cars**

At the beginning of the factory's construction, SAW was dedicated to producing military vehicles. In the past decade, military vehicle orders have sharply decreased. A factory with a production capacity of 25,000 vehicles has only a few hundred orders per year.

In 1978, Rao Bin made a decisive decision to immediately convert the main production capacity to civilian vehicles. Facing the market immediately brought vitality to the enterprise. In 1978, the production of five-ton trucks began. After 1985, the production increased by 10,000 vehicles per year. This year's production can exceed 140,000 vehicles. SAW is now the largest automobile enterprise in China. Among the world's same-tonnage truck manufacturers, it ranks third.

A correct decision at a critical juncture often determines the rise and fall of an enterprise. Many large third-line enterprises are still struggling to get out of the predicament, while SAW has long broken through the pattern of "one large factory, one tonnage, one basic model" and is developing towards all-round and series.

The group's affiliated joint venture factories produce various types of buses, special-purpose vehicles, and modified vehicles to meet the needs of various aspects of society.

SAW's development strategy has shifted to passenger cars. SAW is about to build a modern large-scale enterprise with an economic scale, built according to international standards, and producing 300,000 passenger cars per year.

When asked about the choice of the starting car model, Chen Qingtai, who usually speaks less, became somewhat excited:

"We have chosen an ordinary passenger car as our starting product, which is internationally known as a BC-level car. This type of car is relatively economical, easy to popularize, and suitable for China's current economic level. Government agencies, urban and rural enterprises and institutions, commerce, tourism, schools, and groups will have more official cars, business cars, and tourist cars, and the overall pace of social life will accelerate, and the work efficiency of the whole country will be greatly improved."

SAW's ambition is to enter the world market. It has adopted a dual-market strategy—with the international market as the target and the domestic market as the support. It will jointly produce passenger cars with internationally renowned enterprises. Chen Qingtai told me that the basic model introduced in the first phase of the project will be the new generation of products that the foreign party is developing and plans to launch in the early 1990s. This will ensure that when the new car is launched, it will have strong competitiveness in the international market.

The enthusiasm of the Chinese people for passenger cars has deeply moved them. There were 13 provinces and more than 100 cities competing to build the passenger car factory in their places. In August last year, the State Council decided to locate it in Wuhan. The factory site is in Hankou Town. The mayor of Wuhan, Zhao Baojiang, told me that the Wuhan Municipal Government has made a comprehensive plan and detailed implementation plan for land acquisition, demolition, water supply, electricity, gas, steam, postal and telecommunications, roads, railways, ports, residential areas, and foreigner apartments. Wuhan will ensure the creation of the best external environment for the passenger car project to start.

Readers are probably most concerned about when SAW's passenger cars will be launched. Chen Qingtai answered: "The first phase of the project will start next year, and cars can be produced in 1993. It is worth mentioning that when our first passenger car comes off the assembly line, its localization rate will reach 59%."

    二汽在中部崛起
    跨越20年，二汽以十堰为基地，积极向外扩展，组建企业集团，从生产越野车、载重卡车到研制轿车。二汽的雄心壮志是：跻身世界市场。
    本报记者　林钢
    走出神农架，走向世界
    用现代的观点看，把一个汽车厂建设在大山沟里是荒谬的。第二汽车制造厂无论在国内还是在海外，知名度都很高，却很少有人说得准确它在哪里。国内有许多人到武汉去找二汽，外国人以为它就在北京。
    中外参观者来到鄂西北的十堰市，又几乎无一例外地发出感叹：共产党人居然在大巴山和秦岭之间这片荒山野岭，建成了这样一座漂亮的现代化汽车城！
    十堰市24万人口，2／3是汽车工人及其家属。一条山沟里容纳一座或几座工厂，30家专业厂分布在东西绵延30公里、南北宽8公里的山间盆地。经过不断更新的2万多台设备中，许多具有国际水平；计算机和微电子技术已广泛应用。
    今年9月，8万二汽职工刚刚欢庆过建厂20周年。以人为譬，二汽恰当风华正茂的青年。他们生产东风牌汽车，投产十年，累计为祖国贡献80万辆汽车，创税利37.5亿元，固定资产在投资基础上，增加一倍，原来的一个二汽变成了两个二汽。
    我一到这里就发现，二汽早已在向山外移动！
    1985年，当二汽形成了10万辆的生产能力，山沟的空间顿然显得太狭小了。一个大企业怎能远离市场，远离信息？是蛟龙岂能困守在龙潭？首任厂长饶斌决定向山外实行战略展开。
    第一个桥头堡就是襄樊。与当年诸葛亮高卧隆中的卧龙岗遥遥相望，二汽襄樊基地建在油坊岗。这是一块“水淹七军”也淹不着的高地。这里是二汽的重型车基地和发动机基地。为了迎接中国汽车工业的腾飞，这里还在建造中国最大的汽车试验场。
    二汽人把战略展开称作“三级跳”。这第三跳便是将轿车基地建在武汉。从那里，有黄金水道长江直通大海，汽车产品将源源不断流向世界。
    如果出一道智力测验题：“二汽在哪里？”回答“在十堰市”就不能得满分。如今的二汽已不是地图上的一个点儿。从十堰市，走出神农架，经襄樊，沿着汉水顺流而下，直达武汉，正在形成一条汽车工业的长廊。二汽将首先实现“中部崛起”的宏图大业。
            从二汽，到二汽集团
    现任厂长陈清泰是位开拓型的企业家。他常说：“没有改革开放，就没有二汽的今天。”十年风风雨雨，二汽人走在改革的前列。
    十年前，改革伊始，正逢调整时期。国家累计已经投资16.7亿元，要建成出车还需7亿元。可是财政困难再也拿不出钱了。
    欲上不能，欲下也难。停建缓建几乎意味着覆灭。当时的厂长黄正夏忧心如焚，他和领导班子提出了“要政策，不要钱”的改革方案。即国家不再投资，只给企业以自主权，允许二汽将税后留利、更新改造基金和大修理基金捆起来使用，
  “自筹资金，续建二汽。”
    在当时，这对产品经济来说是个新的突破。方案获得批准。改革第一仗也打得漂亮。其后就出现了二汽历史上“势如破竹”的黄金时期。
    1981年，二汽最先成立联营公司，打开了横向联合发展专业化生产的局面。1982年，继首钢之后，二汽对国家实行利润递增包干，基本解决了企业与国家的关系。1983年，成立进出口公司，很快在纽约、汉堡、香港建立了商务机构，为产品进入国际市场作好准备。1984年，制定中长期发展规划，着手考虑企业发展的后劲。1986年，实现国家计划单列，取得了与国家有关部门直接对话的权力……
    十年后的今天，二汽已由一个大厂，发展成为具有汽车开发、生产、科研、信息、销售与服务等综合功能的大型企业集团。成员厂共287家，遍布全国28省、市、自治区，横跨14个部门，生产着300多个品种系列的产品，全部实现了赢利。职工人数27万，相当于几个“集团军”的“兵力”。
    中国汽车工业大厂不大、小厂太多、小而全、分散、落后的格局，开始为企业集团冲破。而彻底解决这个问题，也终归要依靠组建企业集团。企业集团不是数量的简单相加，而是生产要素的优化组合，现有资源的重新合理配置。集团成员之间，突破了产品、技术的联合，开始向经济的联合、资产一体化的方向发展。
    现在，二汽开始向公司化体制迈进。陈清泰介绍说，公司化体制分三个层次：第一个层次——公司总部，是决策层，是整个集团唯一的投资中心，负责制订经营战略，长远发展规划，决定投资方向、人事管理。第二个层次，是由若干专业部和分公司、子公司组成的中间层，这是利润中心，负责产品开发，生产经营。第三个层次——专业厂，这是基础层，是成本中心，负责生产管理和降低成本。
          越野车、载重卡车、轿车
    建厂之初，二汽是专门生产军车的。近十余年，军车订货锐减。拥有25000辆生产能力的大厂，一年订货只数百辆。
    1978年，饶斌当机立断，立即将主要生产能力转产民用汽车。面向市场立即给企业带来了生机。1978年五吨卡车投产。1985年以后，每年以递增一万辆的速度发展。今年产量可以突破14万辆。二汽如今是中国最大的汽车企业。在世界同吨位卡车制造厂中，位列第三。
    转折关头的一项正确决策，往往决定着企业的盛衰。许多大三线企业至今尚未走出困境，二汽却早已突破了“一个大厂、一种吨位、一个基本车型”的格局，朝着全方位、系列化方向发展。集团所属的联营厂，生产着各种客车、专用车、改装车，以满足社会各方面的需要。
    二汽发展的战略重点，已经转移到轿车。二汽即将兴建的，是达到经济规模、按国际规范化程序建设、年产轿车30万辆的现代化大型企业。
    问及起步车型的选择，平日说话不多的陈清泰有些兴奋：
  “我们的起步产品选择了普通型轿车，国际上通用的说法叫BC级车。这种车比较经济，容易普及，适合我国当前经济水平。政府机关、城乡企事业单位、商业旅游、学校团体有了更多的公务用车、商务用车、旅游用车，整个的社会生活节奏会加快，全国的工作效率将大大提高。”
    二汽的雄心壮志是：跻身世界市场。它采取了双市场型战略——以国外市场为目标，以国内市场为后盾。它将和国际著名的企业合资生产轿车。陈清泰告诉我，第一期工程引进的基本车型，将是外方正在开发，准备在90年代初投放市场的新一代产品。这将保证新车问世之时，在国际市场有较强的竞争力。
    国人对于上轿车的热情使他们深深感动。曾有13个省的百余城市，争取将轿车厂建在他们那里。去年8月，国务院拍板定点武汉。厂址选在汉阳沌口镇。武汉市市长赵宝江告诉我，武汉市政府已就征地拆迁、供水、供电、煤气、蒸汽、邮政电讯、公路、铁路、港口、生活小区、外籍人员公寓等，作出总体规划与详尽的实施计划，武汉将确保为轿车工程上马创造最良好的外部环境。
    读者想必最关心二汽的轿车究竟何时问世。陈清泰是这样回答的：“第一期工程明年动工，1993年可以出车。值得一提的是：当我们的第一辆轿车从生产线上下来时，它的国产化率便可达到59％。”
