People's Daily, Xi'an, Jing Xianfeng reports: Data from the Shaanxi Provincial Family Planning Commission indicates that in the first half of this year, the province had approximately 400,000 births, with a birth rate 2 per thousand higher than the same period last year. In many grassroots units, population control targets are merely general figures without specific allocation to individuals. In recent years, about one-third of births outside the plan have been due to early marriages and early childbearing. The province has failed to meet its population control targets for three consecutive years. If the disorderly birth control situation is not rectified, the province will again struggle to achieve its population control goals this year.

The "11 Billion Population Day" has sounded an alarm for Shaanxi Province, which lags behind in family planning achievements. Since April this year, the province's party and government leaders at all levels have generally taken practical actions to address a series of urgent issues in family planning from the aspects of policy, leadership, personnel, and funding. In May, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government convened a meeting in Hanzhong, inviting the party secretaries or mayors of 10 prefectures and cities to promote the new experiences of Hanzhong in rural family planning work, which was commended by the State Council. In July, they convened a meeting with the heads of family planning commissions from various prefectures and cities to discuss strategies for achieving population control targets.

To quickly reverse the passive situation, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government decided to launch a "Six Cleans and Two Implementations" campaign in the second half of this year, focusing on rectifying birth control order across the province. The "Six Cleans" include: ensuring the implementation of contraceptive measures, addressing unplanned pregnancies, handling over-quota births, collecting over-quota birth fees, investigating early marriages and early childbearing, and rectifying improper practices in the field of family planning. The "Two Implementations" refer to implementing family planning policies and population control targets. This fundamental national policy education activity, which involves thousands of households, is currently being carried out across the province. The Yulin region, which took the lead in rectifying birth control order, emphasized starting from the leadership and state cadres and employees. Significant progress has been made in investigating the over-quota births of cadres and employees. The regional party secretary personally directed the investigation, uncovering more than 10,000 cadres and employees who had over-quota births since 1980, solving a long-standing "difficult problem."

A relevant official from the Provincial Family Planning Commission told the reporter during an interview that recent spot checks have shown that there is a significant amount of "water" in population birth statistics. Therefore, the basis for analyzing the population situation should not be placed on statistical reports with "water." He emphatically stated: After the population census next year, the province will publish annual population change data since 1982, which will be a strict test for the family planning work in various places.

### 连续3年未完成人口控制计划  陕西大力整顿生育秩序

    连续3年未完成人口控制计划
    陕西大力整顿生育秩序
    本报西安电　记者景险峰报道：陕西省计划生育委员会提供的数据表明：今年上半年，全省出生婴儿约40万人，出生率比去年同期高出2个千分点；在相当多的基层，人口计划指标仅仅是个笼统的千分点，并没有具体分解落实到人头；近几年计划外生育人口中，因早婚而早育的竟占1／3左右；全省已经连续3年没有完成人口控制计划。人口出生率失控的生育秩序再不整顿，全省今年又将难以实现人口控制目标。
    “11亿人口日”给计划生育工作实绩处于后进状态的陕西省敲响了警钟。今年4月份以来，这个省各级党政主要领导，普遍做到真抓实干，从政策、领导、编制、经费等方面，为计划生育工作集中解决了一批迫切的实际问题。5月份，省委、省政府召集全省10个地、市的书记或专员、市长，在汉中地区召开现场会，推广受到国务院表彰肯定的这个地区做好农村计划生育工作的新鲜经验。7月份，又召集各地市计生委主任，研讨了实现人口控制目标的对策。
    为尽快扭转被动局面，陕西省委、省政府决定今年下半年在全省范围内开展以整顿生育秩序为中心的计划生育“六清两落实”活动。“六清”包括：节育措施落实清，计划外怀孕补救清，超生对象处理清，超生子女费征收清，早婚早育查处清，计划生育领域不正之风查处清；“两落实”是指：计划生育政策落实，人口计划指标落实。这项牵动千家万户的基本国策教育活动，现正在全省深入开展。率先整顿生育秩序的榆林地区，强调从领导机关和国家干部、职工做起，在清查干部职工超生方面已取得重大突破。地委书记亲自指挥，共清查出1980年以来超生干部职工1万多名，一举解决了多年来难以下手的这个“老大难”问题。
    省计生委有关负责人接受采访时告诉记者，近几年的抽查表明，人口出生统计的“水分”相当大，所以对人口形势分析的基点，决不能侥幸地放在有“水分”的统计报表上。他大声疾呼：明年进行人口普查后，全省将分年度公布1982年以来人口变动数据，这对各地计划生育工作是严格检验。
