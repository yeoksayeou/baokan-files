At the crossroads of Zhangjiabu in Weiyang District, Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, there are always people from out of town carrying bags, shouldering poles, and carrying bedrolls, haggling in various dialects to find work. However, recently, people have noticed that there have been some subtle changes in the demand for labor: educated individuals are becoming increasingly valued.

On the morning of September 25, I came to this area for an interview. In no time, a tall and thin young man strolled over, and was immediately surrounded by a crowd. A middle-aged man with a full beard asked eagerly, "Hiring people? I'll go! I can drive a cart, sow seeds, plow fields, stack, winnow, and use a sieve, all of which I am skilled at!" Another burly young man with a deep voice shouted, "I have plenty of strength! No matter how heavy the work, I can handle it!" The tall and thin young man looked around and shook his hand, saying, "Fellows, don't rush. I need a printer. I need to print foreign language reference materials for university students, and I need someone who understands English to typeset. Does anyone here know English?"

Those who had eagerly volunteered earlier now looked dejected, their heads hanging low as they retreated.

The tall and thin young man then walked to the west side of the street, searching for a while before finally finding the help he needed. Satisfied, he took the person home.

As they passed by the people who had earlier volunteered, someone loudly asked, "How much do you pay per day?" "Seven yuan!" A murmur ran through the crowd, and they watched enviously as the two figures disappeared into the distance.

"I have eight or nine mu of vegetable fields and want to hire someone who knows how to manage them," said an elderly man with gray hair and a beard, looking for help. "How much per day?" "Three yuan." "I'll go!" A sturdy young man named Tao jumped up from the ground and said. The elderly man looked at him and asked, "Can you keep accounts?" "No." "That won't do."

A thin young man with a fair complexion pushed his way to the elderly man and introduced himself, "I graduated from high school, I know how to grow vegetables and keep accounts. How much per day?" "Three yuan." "To grow vegetables and keep accounts, only three yuan per day? That's not worth it, goodbye!" The young man turned around and walked away.

The elderly man followed him, chasing after him and saying, "How much do you want? Let's talk about it!" "Five yuan." The young man stood his ground, not willing to negotiate.

After haggling for a while, the elderly man had to give in, inviting the young man onto a tricycle, and pedaled away contentedly.

In front of a shop on the east side of the crossroads, three or four young women from out of town sat there, their faces filled with worry, listlessly watching others haggle. One of them, a short and plump girl, said slowly, "A few years ago, I came here to take care of children, and people were eager to hire me. This year, it's different. They first ask if you can read and write, if you can sing, and if you can tell stories. I can't do any of those, and as soon as they hear that, they shake their heads like a peddler's drum. Why do you need education to take care of children?"

I smiled and said, "Nowadays, most people have only one child, and they want to cultivate and educate their children from a young age. It's not just about making the child stop crying. From the sound of it, you all seem to be from Shangzhou, right? None of you have gone to school?"

They were all from the mountains of Shangzhou and had only attended school for a few years, at most three or four, before dropping out to work in the fields.

The girls spoke, and tears welled up in their eyes.

Let's hope that this subtle change in the market will be known to more people.

　　未央区劳动力需求发生变化
　　有文化有技术的受欢迎
　　刘秀江
    陕西省西安市未央区张家堡的十字街头，一年四季都有提包的、挑担的和背铺盖卷的外乡人，在这儿南腔北调地讨价还价，寻活儿干。不过，最近人们发现，劳动力需求发生了一些微妙变化：文化人越来越吃“香”了。
    9月25日早上，我来到这儿采访。不大工夫，一个瘦高个青年人慢步来到这里，“呼啦”一下被人团团围住。一个满脸络腮胡子的中年汉子抢先问道：“雇人不？我去！我吆车撒种犁地，摞积旋筛簸簸箕，全在行！”另一个膀大腰粗的壮小伙，粗喉咙高嗓门嚷道：
  “咱有的是莽力气，多重的活路，咱也不在话下！”瘦高个青年人环视一下左右，摇着手说：“乡亲们，都甭着急，我雇请一个印刷工人。因为要给大学学生印刷外语参考教材，需要个懂外语的人排版，有学过英语的人吗？”刚才那几个抢着要去的人，一个个泄了气，耷拉着脑袋直往后缩。
    瘦高个青年人又到这个街头的西边转悠，寻找了半天，终于找到了需要的帮工，满意地带着人回家。
    他们路经刚才抢着要去的那些人身旁，有个人大声问：“一天给多钱啊？”“七块！”人群中传出一阵唏嘘声，用羡慕的眼光目送着他们远去的背影。
      “我有八九亩菜园子，想找个会务菜的把式。”一个五十开外的花白胡子老汉来到这儿找帮工。“多钱一天？”
  “一天三块。”“我去！”一位姓陶的莽小伙，从地上一蹦，站起身来说。花白胡子老汉望着他问道：“你会记帐吗？”“不会。”“那不成。”
    一个白净面皮的瘦小伙挤到老汉跟前，自我介绍说：
  “我高中毕业，会种菜，也会记帐，一天给多钱？”“三块。”“既要种菜，还要记帐，一天才给三块钱，连门都没有，拜拜！”白脸瘦小伙说着话，摆摆手，拿架子似的转身就走。
    老汉紧跟在他身后，边撵边说：“你要多少钱，站下好说话嘛！”“五块。”小伙站住脚，价格扳得很硬，一点儿也不让步。
    两人讨价还价了半天，老汉只好让步，把小伙请上三轮车，蹬着车心满意足地走了。
    十字路东边商店门前，三四个十七八岁的外乡姑娘蹲在那儿。她们个个满脸愁云，没精打彩地望着别人在争高论低，显得十分冷落。其中一个白白胖胖的矮个姑娘慢腾腾地说：
  “前几年我来给人看娃，人还抢着要呢。今年不行了。那人先问识字不识字？会唱歌吗？会讲故事吗？我都不会，人家一听，头摇得像货郎鼓一样。看个娃，要文化干么子啊？”
    我笑笑说：“现今大多数人都是一个独苗苗，人家从小就要培养教育碎娃（小孩）呢，哪能光哄得娃不哭就行了？听话音，你们好像是商州人吧！都没上过学吗？”
    她们都是商州山里人，没念过几年书，顶多念三四年就辍学，干农活了。
    姑娘们说着话，鼻子一酸，泪珠在眼眶直打转转。
    但愿这市场上发生的微妙变化，为更多的父老姐妹知道。
