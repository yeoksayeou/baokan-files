After reading the report "The Tune of the Times," we indeed saw from one angle the shining aspects in the thoughts of several generations of model workers in our country.

Undeniably, due to differences in life experience, knowledge horizon, and emotional expression, their career pursuits and life interests present their own characteristics. The older generation's motivation is more from the deep emotional foundation formed by their contrast between the old and the new; the middle-aged are perhaps mainly driven by their career pursuits; the young often carry a fashionable hue of realizing "personal value." However, the red thread running through the thoughts of these generations of model workers is so vivid, that is, to give their utmost for the motherland, for the people, and for the cause, and to make creative contributions. This is the shining point of their thoughts.

Someone once analyzed the several generations of people in our country and popularized the term "generation gap." It cannot be said that these are entirely groundless, nor can it be said that thinking in this direction is meaningless. People are always developing, changing, and advancing with the times. However, when making such observations and reflections, there is a question of choosing the correct standpoint and scientific method. If we exaggerate the differences in characteristics and even say that they are in opposition, and do not see the precious things that run through the thoughts of several generations, then we will at least fall into a terrible one-sidedness. "Sighing at the sight of young people" and "shaking one's head at the sight of the elderly" will both bring serious negative consequences. The general term "generation gap" is not scientific. If we must say there is a "gap," then our focus is undoubtedly on "communication."

We should let the shining things continue to shine. Especially the younger generation, they are the hope and future of the motherland. Precisely because of this, they should inherit and carry forward the shining things from their predecessors. Revolutionary heroism and the spirit of active dedication to the people are very precious traditions, they are the things that will always shine.

On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, the National Model Workers Conference was held, which was a review, showcasing the lively scene of several generations of model workers gathering together in our country; it was also a vivid call, in the era of reform and opening up, in the struggle to achieve the Four Modernizations and revitalize China, the spirit of heroism and dedication should shine even more brightly!

    让闪光的永远闪光
    文牛
    读了《时代的格调》这篇通讯，我们确实从一个角度窥见了我国几代劳模思想中闪光的东西。
    不可否认，由于生活经历、知识视野、感情表达的不同，他们的事业追求和生活情趣呈现了各自的特色。年长的，他们的动力更多地是发自他们新旧对比形成的深厚感情基础；中年的，激励他们的也许主要是事业的追求；年轻的，则往往带有实现“个人价值”的时髦色彩。但是，贯穿这几代劳模思想的红线却是如此鲜明，那就是为祖国、为人民、为事业尽自己最大努力，做出创造性的奉献的精神。这正是他们思想的闪光之处。
    有人曾作过关于我国几代人的分析，也曾经流行过“代沟”之类的说法。不能说这些都是毫无根据的，也不能说作这方面的思考是没有意义的。人，总是随着时代在发展、在变化、在前进的。但是，在作这种观察与思考的时候，有一个选择正确的立足点和科学方法的问题。如果夸大了不同特点的分野，甚至把它们之间说成是对立的关系，而看不到贯穿几代人思想的可贵的东西，那我们至少会陷入可怕的片面性。“一说小青年就叹气”，“一见老年人就摇头”，两者都会带来严重的消极后果。笼统的“代沟”说法，并不科学。如果硬说有“沟”的话，那么我们的侧重点无疑在于“沟通”。
    应该让闪光的东西继续闪光。特别是年轻的一代，他们是祖国的希望，祖国的未来，唯其如此，他们更应该把先辈人身上闪光的东西继承下来，发扬光大。革命英雄主义，为人民积极奉献的精神，就是非常宝贵的传统，就是永远闪光的东西。
    在建国40周年前夕召开的全国劳模大会，是一次检阅，它展示了我国几代劳模济济一堂的生动景象；它也是一次形象的号召，改革开放的时代，在实现四化，振兴中华的奋斗中，英雄主义和奉献精神，应该焕发出更灿烂的光辉！
