U.S. and South Korean Military Joint Exercise

According to the Korean Central News Agency, the U.S. military and South Korean military have recently conducted continuous military exercises aimed at North Korea.

The KCNA quoted a military insider as saying that on the 14th, a squadron of A-6 attack aircraft from the U.S. Pacific Fleet's First Marine Aircraft Wing flew into South Korean airspace, performing low-altitude stealth flights near the military demarcation line. They took North Korean targets as hypothetical attack objectives and conducted prolonged air strike exercises.

On the 13th, more than 20 F-16 nuclear-capable fighter-bombers from the U.S. Seventh Air Force stationed in South Korea conducted bombing exercises for several hours, targeting central North Korean regions as hypothetical objectives.

Prior to this, South Korea mobilized a large number of combat-ready forces, as well as aircraft, tanks, and armored vehicles, near the military demarcation line on the 10th and 11th, conducting exercises to seize positions.

    美国军队和南朝鲜军队联合演习
    据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，美军和南朝鲜军队近日连续进行了针对朝鲜北方的军事演习。
    朝中社援引军事消息灵通人士的话说，十四日，美国太平洋舰队第一海军陆战队飞行联队的A—6攻击机编队飞进南朝鲜上空，在军事分界线附近低空隐蔽飞行，以北方地区的目标为假设攻击对象，长时间进行了空袭演习。十三日，驻南朝鲜美军第七航空队的二十多架F—16载核战斗轰炸机，以北方中心地区为假想目标，进行了长达数小时的轰炸演习。
    在此之前，南朝鲜在十日和十一日动员了大批有生力量以及飞机、坦克和装甲车等在军事分界线附近进行了攻占阵地的作战演习。
