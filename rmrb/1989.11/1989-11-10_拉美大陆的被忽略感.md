The economic crisis in Latin America, which has persisted for nearly a decade, not only remains unresolved but has become increasingly apparent. During recent interviews, the reporter visited Lima, Quito, Guayaquil, and the reporter's usual residence in Caracas, where the surrounding slums are continually expanding, and the city centers are filled with street vendors, essentially representing the disguised unemployed. Local currencies continue to depreciate, and prices are rising at a dizzying rate. Social security has deteriorated across the board. For these countries, which were considered middle-income developing nations in the 1970s, the 1980s have indeed been a "lost decade."

Facing this situation, what are Latin Americans thinking, and how do they evaluate the future of Latin America? The reporter attempted to find answers to these questions during this interview.

Peruvian President Alan García bluntly stated at an international conference that new developments in the international situation may have adverse effects on Latin America. The basis for this is that the confrontation between the two major post-war political and military blocs has decreased, and the trend towards dialogue has developed. Additionally, the opening and reforms of countries like the Soviet Union may mean a reorganization of the world market, changing the flow of international capital and Western technological achievements. The existing South-North economic relations will be replaced by new East-West economic relations. Western countries are transferring funds obtained from Latin American and Third World debt repayment to the East, making Latin American countries more passive in debt negotiations. President García's remarks reveal a sense of loss and neglect in Latin America under the new international situation.

During an interview with former Ecuadorian President Dr. Oswaldo Hurtado, the reporter again encountered this sense of loss and neglect. He presented a speech he gave at an international academic conference this year, stating that the speech precisely expounds on the view that Latin America may become a neglected continent. According to Dr. Hurtado's judgment, in the future, Latin America will not hold an important position in the external economic relations of the United States and Western Europe.

Firstly, U.S. attention to the Latin American region will continue to decline. As the possibility of U.S.-Soviet conflicts in the Third World decreases, U.S. interest in the Third World will also decline. U.S. concern for the Latin American region has been decreasing since the Reagan era. The central point of "Reaganism" was solving the Nicaraguan problem, ignoring the severe economic problems in Latin America. The Reagan administration mistakenly believed that the recovery of the U.S. economy could drive the recovery of the Latin American economy. Coupled with debt restructuring and economic austerity in Latin American countries, the debt problem could be solved. This was an important reason why the Reagan administration refused to discuss solving the Latin American debt problem politically. Furthermore, the U.S. economy will no longer have the status and strength it had in the 1960s, and it currently faces the difficulties of huge fiscal and trade deficits. Under these circumstances, it is unrealistic to expect the U.S. to implement ambitious economic cooperation plans in Latin America (like Kennedy's Alliance for Progress in the 1960s), let alone implement a new Marshall Plan.

Secondly, the emergence of a united Europe in 1992 may not be beneficial for Latin America. In the context of reforms in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, Western Europe will prioritize developing economic relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries in addition to maintaining economic relations with the U.S. and Japan. Moreover, after the formation of the European single market, protectionism may strengthen. Latin America's exports to Western Europe have already decreased in recent years. If Europe further expands restrictions on imports from Latin America after unification, Latin America's crisis will deepen.

From the perspective of Latin America itself, the political situation remains unstable, and long-term development plans cannot be implemented. However, social stability and the continuity of economic policies are precisely important conditions for development.

Latin America has been stagnant for a decade. The living standards of Latin Americans are now equivalent to those of a decade ago. Dr. Hurtado worriedly estimated that, from the current trend, this stagnation will not show signs of reversal in the 1990s.

Where is the way out? Increasingly, more people are beginning to realize that they can no longer rely on others to help Latin America solve its difficulties. The president of the Peruvian newspaper "El Expresso," former minister Manuel Ulloa, wrote in an article: "No one will solve our problems for us unless we rely on our own efforts, labor, and national and regional unity to solve them." Another Peruvian, the coordinator of the Latin American Parliament, Torres, sharply pointed out that in the context of the regionalization of the world economy, a Latin America divided by tariff barriers, small markets, and technological backwardness into more than 20 countries, if it does not unite, how will it survive? According to Peruvian colleagues, the real focus of the recent summit of the eight countries was to aim for 1992, seriously implementing integration and establishing a common market in Latin America. It is believed that this is the hope for this neglected continent.

Latin American countries are more accustomed to looking outward. But the new reality may be forcing people to change their way of thinking.

### 拉美大陆的被忽略感

    拉美大陆的被忽略感
    本报记者　朱满庭
    拉丁美洲的经济危机历经将近10年之后不但远远没有解决，而且日益表面化了。记者最近在采访过程中所到的利马、基多、瓜亚基尔和记者常驻的加拉加斯等大城市，周围的贫民区不断扩大，市中心到处是摆地摊的小贩，这实际上是变相失业的人群。当地货币一贬再贬，物价上涨之快令人目眩。各国社会治安普遍恶化。对这些70年代就被称为中等收入的发展中国家来说，80年代确实是“丢掉的十年”。
    面对这种形势，拉丁美洲人在作何想法，对拉美的前景怎样估价，记者这次采访中试图寻找对这些问题的答案。
    秘鲁总统阿兰·加西亚在一次国际会议上直言不讳地表示，国际形势的新发展可能对拉美产生不利的影响。根据是，战后形成的两大政治军事集团的对抗程度下降和对话势头的发展以及苏联等社会主义国家的开放改革，可能意味着世界市场的重组，改变国际资本和西方科技成果的流向，现有的南北经济关系将被新的东西方经济关系所取代，西方国家正在把拉美和第三世界偿还债务所获得的资金转移到东方，拉美国家在债务谈判中处境将更加被动。阿兰总统的这番讲话流露出在新的国际形势下，拉丁美洲的某种失落感、被忽略感。
    记者在厄瓜多尔采访前总统奥斯瓦尔多·乌尔塔多博士时，这种失落感、被忽略感又得到了印证。他拿出一份他在今年的一次国际学术讨论会上的发言稿对记者说，这个发言正是阐述这个观点的，即拉美可能成为一个被忽略的大陆。按照乌尔塔多博士的判断，在今后美国、西欧的对外经济关系中，拉美都不会居于重要位置。
    首先，美国对拉美地区的关注将继续下降。随着美苏在第三世界发生冲突的可能性减少，美国对第三世界的兴趣也会日益下降。美国对于拉美地区的关心程度从里根时代起已开始减弱。“里根主义”的中心点是解决尼加拉瓜问题，忽略了拉美严重的经济问题。里根政府错误地以为美国经济的回升可以带动拉美经济的恢复，再加上债务重组和拉美国家的经济紧缩，债务问题就可以解决，这是导致里根政府拒绝从政治上讨论解决拉美债务问题的重要原因。另外，美国经济不会再有60年代那样的地位和实力，而且目前面临着财政和贸易赤字巨大的困难。在这种情况下，幻想美国会在拉美推行雄心勃勃的经济合作计划（像60年代肯尼迪推行进步联盟那样），是不实际的，更不用说它会搞什么新的马歇尔计划了。
    其次，1992年联合的欧洲的出现也未必对拉美有利。在苏联和东欧国家改革的情况下，西欧日后除继续把与美、日经济关系置于首位外，当务之急是发展与苏联东欧国家的经济关系。此外，欧洲统一大市场形成后，贸易保护主义可能加强。拉美近年来对西欧的出口已有所下降，欧洲联合后若再扩大对从拉美进口的限制，拉美的危机还要加深。
    从拉美自身的情况看，拉美政局仍不稳定，长远的发展计划无法推行。而社会稳定和经济政策的连续性恰恰是发展的重要条件。
    拉美已经停滞了10年。拉美人的生活现在只相当于10年前的水平，乌尔塔多博士不无忧虑地估计，从目前的趋势看，这种停滞在90年代仍看不到扭转的迹象。
    出路在哪里？现在越来越多的人都开始认识到，不能再指望别人来帮助拉美解决困难了。秘鲁《快报》社长、前任部长马努埃尔·乌略亚在一篇文章中感慨地写道：别人不会替我们解决问题，除非靠我们自己的努力、劳动和民族及区域的团结去解决。另一位秘鲁人士、拉美议会的协调员唐森尖锐地提出，在世界经济区域化发展的情况下，一个被关税壁垒、狭小市场和技术落后分割成20多个国家的拉丁美洲，如不团结起来，将何以自处？据秘鲁同行透露，最近8国集团首脑会议讨论的真正重点是瞄准1992年，认真着手实行一体化，建立拉美共同市场。据认为，这才是这个被忽略的大陆的希望所在。
    拉美国家比较习惯于眼睛盯着外部。但新的现实也许正逼着人们改变自己的思维方式。
