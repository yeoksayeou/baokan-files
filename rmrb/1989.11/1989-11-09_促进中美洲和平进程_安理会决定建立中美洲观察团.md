People's Daily, United Nations, November 7th - Correspondent Liu Kai Chen reports: The United Nations Security Council today unanimously decided to establish the United Nations Observer Group in Central America to supervise the implementation of the peace agreement reached by the five Central American heads of state on August 7, 1987, to resolve the Central American issue.

The observer group's term is six months, during which it will conduct on-site supervision to ensure the cessation of aid to anti-government armed forces and the prohibition of using one country's territory to attack another.

This resolution was adopted based on the proposal made by UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar on October 11. Pérez de Cuéllar expressed satisfaction with this at the Security Council meeting.

After the meeting, the Security Council's chairman for November, Li Luye, issued a statement, expressing that all member states fully support Pérez de Cuéllar's efforts to assist the five Central American governments in achieving a peaceful resolution to the Central American issue. They also hope that this observer group will make a positive contribution to achieving lasting peace in Central America.

    促进中美洲和平进程
    安理会决定建立中美洲观察团
    本报联合国11月7日电　记者刘开宸报道：联合国安理会今天一致决定建立联合国中美洲观察团，以监督执行中美洲5国首脑在1987年8日达成的和平解决中美洲问题的协议。
    观察团任期为6个月，要实地监督停止对反政府武装的援助，以及不得使用一国领土攻击另一国。
    这项决议是采纳了联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔10月11日提出的建议。德奎利亚尔在安理会会议上对此表示满意。
    会后，安理会本月主席李鹿野发表声明，表示全体理事国完全支持德奎利亚尔协助中美洲5国政府为和平解决中美洲问题的努力，并希望此团对中美洲取得持久和平做出积极的贡献。
