	Nationwide investment scale has begun to be effectively curbed in the process of rectification and readjustment.

	According to comprehensive data from various sources, a total of 210,000 fixed asset investment projects worth over 50,000 yuan each have been identified nationwide, with a total investment exceeding 1 trillion yuan. Preliminary statistics show that 18,000 projects have been halted or delayed, which can reduce future investments by 67.5 billion yuan. Among these, 2,507 projects for buildings, halls, and pavilions have been halted or delayed, reducing investments by 26 billion yuan. The trend of excessively constructing buildings, halls, and pavilions in various regions has been effectively controlled. Additionally, a number of small-scale projects that do not align with national industrial policies, such as small silicon iron, small ferroalloys, and small cotton spinning mills, have been halted or delayed.

	An official from the Office of the Leading Group for Project Cleanup under the State Council stated that from 1982 to 1988, the total fixed asset investment of the whole society increased from 120 billion yuan to 450 billion yuan, with an average annual growth rate of 24.7%. This was one of the main reasons for inflation. If this growth rate continued, the total fixed asset investment of the whole society in the first three quarters of this year would have increased by at least 30 billion yuan compared to the same period last year. However, statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics show that the fixed asset investment scale of state-owned enterprises in the first nine months did not increase but decreased by 9.7 billion yuan. Although this figure is still far from the expected target and is not very ideal, it marks the first successful step in reversing the long-term trend of escalating investments, which is quite remarkable.

	According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the total fixed asset investment of the whole society this year is expected to be around 410 billion yuan, a reduction of nearly 40 billion yuan compared to last year. Considering the high-speed expansion in previous years, this is a significant reduction.

	Due to the State Council's appropriate concentration of approval authority for new projects, the number of new projects started this year has significantly decreased compared to last year. In the first three quarters, the number of new projects started for basic construction and technological transformation by state-owned enterprises nationwide was reduced by two-thirds compared to the same period last year. In the reduced new projects, various regions have particularly focused on limiting processing industry and redundant construction projects, providing more initiative and room for controlling investment scale and adjusting investment structure in the future.

	Economists here further point out that in the coming years of continued rectification and readjustment, the task of further reducing general processing industries and construction of buildings, halls, and pavilions remains arduous.

### 全国投资规模得到遏制  停建缓建项目一万八

    全国投资规模得到遏制
    停建缓建项目一万八
    据新华社北京11月16日电　（记者徐克洪）近年来不断大幅度膨胀的全社会固定资产投资规模，在治理、整顿中开始得到有效遏制。
    综合各方面提供的数字，全国共清理出5万元以上的固定资产投资项目21万个，总投资在1万亿元以上。初步统计，全国共停缓建项目1.8万个，可压缩今后投资675亿元；其中楼堂馆所项目2507个，可压缩投资260亿元，各地大上楼堂馆所之风基本上被控制住。各地区还停缓建了一批小硅铁、小铁合金、小棉纺等不符合国家产业政策的高耗能和高耗料项目。
    国务院清理项目领导小组办公室的同志介绍说，1982年到1988年的6年间，全社会固定资产投资从1200亿元增加到4500亿元，年均增长率达24.7％，这是导致通货膨胀的重要原因之一。如照这个增长速度，今年前三个季度全社会固定资产投资至少要比去年同期增加300亿元以上；而国家统计局的统计表明，1至9月全民所有制单位固定资产投资规模不仅没有增长，反而减少了97亿元。尽管这个数字与预期目标还有很大差距，还不甚理想，但这是扭转多年来投资不断膨胀局面成功的第一步，是十分难能可贵的。
    据国家统计局预测，我国今年全社会固定资产投资完成额将在4100亿元上下，比去年压缩近400亿元，联系到前几年高速膨胀的势头，这是一个相当可观的压缩幅度。
    由于国务院适当集中了新开工项目的审批权限，今年新开工建设项目比去年大幅度减少。前三个季度全国全民所有制基本建设和更新改造新开工项目比去年同期减少2／3。在压缩的新开工项目中，各地特别注意限制那些加工工业和重复建设的项目，使今后控制投资规模、调整投资结构的工作取得了更大的主动和余地。
    此间经济界人士进而提出，在继续治理整顿的今后几年中，进一步压缩一般性加工工业和楼堂馆所建设的任务仍很艰巨。
