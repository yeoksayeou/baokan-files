Today, when soldiers of the People's Liberation Army walk through the streets of Sandu, they often hear the warm greeting, "Soldiers, come in and have some tea!" Over the past decade, a certain unit of the PLA stationed in southern Yunnan has persistently worked alongside the Hui people of Sandu to build both material and spiritual civilizations. Through exemplary actions, they have earned the trust of the Sandu people, and the harmonious relationship between the military and civilians has become a renowned story in southern Yunnan.

Sandu is a predominantly Hui ethnic minority area. During the Cultural Revolution, the "leftist" errors undermined the Party's ethnic policies, leading to the "Sandu Incident" case, which caused significant losses to the lives and property of the local Hui people. The relationship between the military and civilians was also severely damaged.

After the "Sandu Incident" was rectified, the certain unit of the PLA sent more than 2,000 soldiers to Sandu to help the people rebuild their homes, construct roads, and level farmland. During the construction, four soldiers lost their precious lives.

The unit regards helping the Sandu people develop production as its responsibility, actively assisting township enterprises in training 120 technical cadres; establishing a special information group to help Sandu farmers expand their sales markets; and planting trees on large areas of barren hillsides. Over the years, the unit has invested nearly 10,000 labor days to help impoverished households develop production.

In recent years, units stationed near Sandu have also prioritized the work of jointly building two civilizations with the Hui people. The military has established adult literacy classes in Sandu, and through years of effort, Sandu has become the first minority area in Yunnan without illiteracy.

　　用爱消除民族隔阂　以情融洽军民关系
　　云南沙甸谱写拥军爱民新篇
    本报昆明电　记者钱江报道：“解放军同志进家坐，请吃茶！”今天，解放军官兵走在沙甸街头，经常可以听到这样热情的招呼。10余年来，解放军驻滇南某部坚持不懈地与沙甸回族群众并肩进行两个文明建设，以模范行动赢得了沙甸人民的信任，军民关系之融洽在滇南传为佳话。
    沙甸是一个以回族为主的少数民族聚居区。“文革”中，“左”的错误破坏了党的民族政策，酿成了“沙甸事件”冤案，使当地回族群众生命财产蒙受重大损失，军民关系也遭到严重破坏。
    “沙甸事件”平反后，解放军某部先后派出2000余名指战员进驻沙甸，帮助群众修建房屋，修路，平整农田。施工中，4名军人献出了宝贵的生命。
    部队把帮助沙甸人民发展生产当成自己的职责，主动帮助乡镇企业培训技术骨干120余人；专门成立了信息小组，帮助沙甸农民开拓销售市场；在荒山坡上大面积植树。几年来，部队还投入近万个劳动日，帮助困难户发展生产。
    近几年，驻沙甸临近地区的部队又把与回族群众共建两个文明的工作摆在重要位置上。部队在沙甸开办了成人文化扫盲班，通过几年努力使沙甸成为云南第一个少数民族无文盲区。
