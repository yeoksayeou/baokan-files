		Effective Measures to Alleviate Difficulties and Ensure Stable Industrial Development in Jilin Province

		36 Essential Commodities for People's Daily Life Guaranteed

		From our reporter Li Anda in Changchun: Since the beginning of this year, Jilin Province has taken various measures to address difficulties in industrial production, such as tight funds, energy, raw materials, transportation, and foreign exchange, as well as a sluggish market and product backlog. The province has organized, coordinated, and mobilized enterprises and workers to ensure stable production and development. From January to September, the province's total industrial output value increased by 5% compared to the same period last year, and fiscal revenue increased by 4.2%.

		At the beginning of the year, the Jilin Provincial Government established a Production Command Center, followed by the establishment of a Financial Coordination Group and a Production-Sales Coordination Group. The Production Command Center is led by a deputy governor in charge, with participation from relevant department heads. It strengthens command and resolves issues related to production scheduling, energy, funds, transportation, raw materials, and coordination between industry and commerce, thereby alleviating difficulties.

		To ensure the production of key enterprises and priority products, the provincial government also determined a policy of preferential treatment at the beginning of the year. Priority is given to ensuring the production of 36 essential commodities for people's daily life, basic industries, and export products for earning foreign exchange; priority is given to ensuring the production of 52 key enterprises that achieve an annual profit and tax of over 10 million yuan and account for 70% of the province's total profit and tax. When arranging the annual plan, these products and enterprises are listed separately in the plan book and issued as provincial government documents to relevant units and departments for implementation. This year, a significant portion of the newly increased bank loans and power generation with materials is used to ensure the production needs of these products and enterprises.

		The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have strengthened ideological and political work as a guarantee for stabilizing policies and enterprises. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have repeatedly announced that the factory director responsibility system, the contract management system, and effective policies will remain unchanged, and the role of large and medium-sized enterprises as backbones will be fully utilized. Starting in July, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government dispatched the Provincial Commission for Economic Restructuring to conduct a special investigation and study of the experiences and problems of the past few years' contract management, and to propose specific opinions on further improving the next round of contract management. Subsequently, a meeting was held at the Jilin Chemical Industry Company to promote the experience of Jilin Chemical Industry Company in focusing on talent development, adhering to one central task and two fundamental principles, and comprehensively improving enterprise quality. These measures have played an important role in stabilizing enterprises and people's minds.

		To expand sales and activate funds, the province launched a campaign to clear inventory and excavate potential, and to handle stagnant materials. In late October, the province and Changchun City jointly held a clearance and potential material exchange fair, with a transaction volume of 2.069 billion yuan in five days.

    措施正确得力　缓解困难有方
    吉林省工业生产稳定发展
    三十六种人民生活必需品生产得到保证
    本报长春电　记者李安达报道：今年以来，吉林省针对工业生产中资金、能源、原材料、交通运输、外汇紧张，市场疲软，产品滞销等困难，从多方面采取措施组织、协调、调动企业和职工积极性，保证生产稳定发展。1—9月，全省工业总产值比去年同期增长5％，财政收入增长4.2％。
    年初，吉林省政府成立生产指挥部，接着又成立资金协调小组和产销协调小组。生产指挥部由1名主管副省长挂帅，各有关部门负责人参加，强化指挥，全权解决生产调度，能源、资金、运输、原材料统筹平衡，以及工商衔接等方面问题，从而缓解了困难。
    为保证骨干企业和重点产品的生产，省政府年初还确定了倾斜政策。重点保证36种人民生活必需品、基础工业和出口换汇产品的生产；重点保证年实现利税千万元以上，上缴利税占全省总额70％的52个重点骨干企业。安排全年计划时，这些产品和企业单独列出计划本子，作为省政府文件下发各有关单位和部门执行。今年新增的银行贷款和带料发电电量，大部分用于保证这些产品和企业生产的需要。
    省委、省政府把加强思想政治工作，作为稳定政策、稳定企业的保证。省委、省政府多次宣布：实行厂长负责制不变，承包经营制不变，正确有效的政策不变，要充分发挥大中型企业骨干作用。7月开始，省委、省政府委派省体改委，对几年来承包的经验和问题做专题调查研究，就进一步搞好下一轮承包提出具体意见。接着，在吉林化学工业公司召开现场会，全面推广吉化狠抓育人这个根本，坚持一个中心、两个基本点，全面提高企业素质的经验。这些措施，对稳定企业、稳定人心，起了重要作用。
    为扩大销售，搞活资金，全省开展清仓挖潜、处理呆滞物资活动。10月下旬，省和长春市联合举办了一次清仓挖潜物资交易会，5天时间成交额20.69亿元。
