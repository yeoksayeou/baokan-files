	The renowned Chinese calligrapher, seal carver, and painter Zhu Fuxiang passed away on November 3 after failing to respond to emergency treatment. He was 90 years old. Yesterday, more than 300 people from various sectors in Shanghai paid their last respects to the master artist at the Shanghai Longhua Funeral Parlor.

	Zhu Fuxiang was born in 1900 in Yinxian County, Zhejiang. As a child, he was known as a prodigy. At the age of 7, he could write large characters in the style of the Stone Drum Texts, which astonished Wu Changshuo, who praised him as a "little friend." At 16, his works were selected for publication in the "National Famous Calligraphers' Seal Collection" by Saoye Mountain Room. At 18, his calligraphy was published by Youzheng Publishing House. At 23, his "Jingquan Seal Collection" was published by Commercial Press, with Wu Changshuo writing the preface and Luo Zhenyu the bookplate. Zhu Fuxiang was well-versed in a wide range of subjects, excelling in calligraphy, painting, seal carving, poetry, ancient literature, bronze, and jade artifacts. The famous calligrapher, painter, and seal carver Ma Gongyu praised him, saying, "Zhu's art is truly unparalleled in a thousand years." The renowned painter Zhang Daqian commented, "Only Zhu can transcend the times and establish a new school." The art master Liu Haisu described him, "His brushwork is profound and full of meaning, with a unique charm, transcending the ancient and modern, and deeply understanding nature."

	In his later years, Zhu Fuxiang worked tirelessly, focusing on the study of Shang and Zhou bronze culture. He compiled his lifetime collection and research on bronze patterns, inscriptions, and rubbings into "Shang Zhou Art and Literature Essentials." In recent years, his large-scale color gold stone painting albums have been published. The ancient-style bronze bells he designed, such as "Sincerity Brings Spirituality," "Chinese Tripod," "Rong Family Treasure Tripod," and "Chinese Bronze Nine-Dragon Treasure Tripod," have all been produced.

    艺术大师朱复戡逝世
    新华社上海11月13日电　我国杰出的金石书画大师朱复戡教授因病经抢救无效，于11月3日逝世，享年90岁。昨天，上海各界300余人前往上海龙华殡仪馆大厅，向这位艺术大师告别。
    朱复戡1900年生于浙江鄞县。幼年有神童之誉，7岁能作擘窠大字石鼓文，吴昌硕见之惊叹不已，称之为“小畏友”。16岁时作品选入扫叶山房出版的《全国名家印选》 ；18岁时，有正书局出版了他的字贴；23岁时，商务印书馆出版了他的《静龛印集》，吴昌硕题扉页，罗振玉题书签。朱复戡博览群籍，学识渊博，金石书画、诗词古文、青铜古玉，无所不通，无所不精。著名书画篆刻家马公愚赞道：“朱君艺术，实千年来一人而已。”国画大师张大千评作：“能超越时流，开一代宗风者，惟朱君一人而已。”艺术大师刘海粟称他：“笔墨之间，渊然有思，醰然有味，神游三代，冥心于造化。”
    晚年的朱复戡孜孜不倦，奋力创作，重点致力于商周青铜文化的研究。他将平生收集、研究的青铜图纹、铭文、拓片编成《商周艺文精华》。近年，他的大型彩色金石书画画册已经出版，他设计的“诚则灵”变音钟、“中华鼎”、“荣氏宝鼎”、“中华青铜九龙宝鼎”等仿古青铜器都已问世。
