The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated at today's afternoon press conference in response to a question from a reporter of the Associated Press about China's reaction to the U.S. Congress passing the "Chinese Student Protection Act" that requiring publicly funded students to return home after graduation is an international norm. The two sides had reached a clear understanding on this matter in the field of educational exchanges. The congressional bill violates the agreement between the Chinese and U.S. governments and does not conform to the usual international practices. The basis on which the U.S. Congress proposed this resolution is also unacceptable.

The spokesperson said that we have always opposed the U.S. Congress passing such bills that seriously damage Sino-U.S. educational exchanges and further deteriorate relations between the two countries. We have already conducted multiple negotiations with the U.S. government on this matter, and the Chinese government will also take further actions.

Another reporter asked, "What measures will China take to attract more Chinese students studying abroad to return home?"

The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the Chinese government is taking a series of measures to ensure that returnees can be properly arranged and play their roles, contributing to the modernization of the motherland.

He also reiterated that the Chinese government's policy of sending students abroad will continue.

　　外交部发言人指出
　　公费留学人员学成回国是国际惯例
　　美国会的法案进一步恶化中美关系
    本报北京11月23日讯　记者孙毅报道：外交部发言人在今天下午举行的新闻发布会上就美联社记者提出的中国对美国国会通过的“中国移民紧急救援法案”有何反应时指出，要求公费留学人员学成回国服务是国际惯例，中美双方在教育交流方面曾经就这件事达成明确的谅解。美国国会的议案违背中美两国政府协议，也不符合国际上通常的作法。美国国会提出这项决议的所谓依据更是不能接受的。
    这位发言人说，我们一贯反对美国国会通过这一类严重损害中美教育交流、进一步恶化两国关系的议案。我们已经就这件事多次向美国政府进行交涉，中国政府还将作出反应。
    另有记者问，“中国采取什么措施以吸引更多的在国外的中国留学生回国？”
    外交部发言人说，中国政府正在采取一系列措施，使学成回国人员能够得到妥善安排，而且能够发挥他们的作用，为祖国四化做出贡献。
    他还重申，中国政府关于向国外派遣留学生的政策将继续下去。
