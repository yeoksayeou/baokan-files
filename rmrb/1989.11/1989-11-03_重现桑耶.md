The restoration work of Samye Monastery in Tibet was completed on October 16th. The once-dilapidated thousand-year-old temple has been restored on the north bank of the Yarlung Zangbo River.

After crossing the river from Zetang Town in the Shannan Region of Tibet and climbing over the vast sandy mountains, one can see a lush, verdant landscape. The Samye Monastery, adorned with colorful carvings and topped with a massive golden roof, stands majestically amidst it all. Upon closer inspection, numerous small, exquisite buildings surround it, forming a layout that matches historical records: the center is Mount Sumeru, surrounded by the Four Great Forests, Eight Great Continents, and the vast world.

Samye Monastery is renowned for several reasons. Firstly, it has a long history, dating back to the mid-8th century (some say 762 AD), making it the oldest Buddhist temple in Tibet. Its history offers a glimpse into the civilization of Tibet. Secondly, it is unique in religious studies. The Nyingma (Red Sect) and Sakya (Flower Sect) sects were established here by the great master Padmasambhava in 761 AD, and it encompasses the Three Jewels of Buddhism: the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. Thirdly, it ingeniously combines Tibetan, Han, and Indian architectural styles, making it a marvel in the field of architecture. For decades, people have lamented not being able to see it in person, but now they can finally do so.

The main hall on the first floor requires entering through three doors, with corridors surrounding it. The guide explained that this is a Han-style building, and the statue of Sakyamuni inside is made of stone, which has survived to this day due to its hardness. The rotting beams on the first and second floors have been completely replaced and repainted in their original style. On the second floor, there is now a statue of Padmasambhava, valued at 160,000 yuan, donated by monks from Qinghai. The bedroom where the Dalai Lamas stayed during their pilgrimages to Samye has also been renovated. The ceiling on the third floor, which was previously copied by many in the art world and referred to as an abstract "worldview" diagram, has been repainted. The central part is in the Tibetan architectural style, with 472 intricately carved stone Buddha statues. The upper part is in the Indian style. On the fifth floor, the 41 pillars symbolizing the goddess Drolma, the 16 Arhats, and the Four Heavenly Kings have all been restored.

Wangqu, the head of the Propaganda Department of Zhanang County (where Samye is located), who oversaw the restoration project, told the reporter that Samye has faced many hardships throughout its history. This time, the state invested 768.6 million yuan and 440 million yuan worth of gold to restore it to its original appearance, following strict design and construction standards.

The reporter also learned that restoring temples in Tibet is not an easy task. For example, the glazed tiles needed for the Four Great Forests and Eight Great Continents had to be procured from places like Shanxi and Fujian. Despite these challenges, the various levels of the Tibet Autonomous Region government have been unwavering in implementing the Party's religious policies, overcoming numerous difficulties, and restoring and opening over 1,400 temples and halls in the past decade.

    重现桑耶
    本报记者　卢小飞
    10月16日，西藏桑耶寺维修工程竣工。一度残破的千年名寺，重现于雅鲁藏布江北。
    从西藏山南地区泽当镇渡江后，翻过莽莽沙山，便见一片葱茏，五彩雕饰的桑耶扛着巨大的金顶耸立其间。近看，无数小巧玲珑的建筑环其周围，整个布局恰如史书所载：中心是须弥山，周围是四大林、八大洲及大千世界。
    桑耶名气之大，首先在于它有悠久的历史——始建于公元8世纪中叶（一说为762年），是西藏最早的佛教寺院，从桑耶的历史似可管窥西藏文明史。其次是它在宗教学方面的独一无二，密宗大师莲华生公元761年在此布道创建桑耶，以后又兼容宁玛（红教）、萨伽（花教）诸教派，佛、法、僧三宝俱全。三是它巧妙地将藏、汉、印三种建筑风格集于一身，实为建筑学上的奇观。数十年来，人们因只能见之于文图而慨叹不已，如今则可一睹为快了。
    去一层的大经堂需三进其门，四周建有回廊，向导说这是汉式建筑，所供释迦牟尼像为石雕，因其坚硬，幸存至今。一、二层曾腐朽的顶木已全部更新，并照原样绘彩。二层楼上现供奉着青海僧人赠送的价值16万元人民币的莲华生佛像，历代达赖喇嘛朝拜桑耶时下榻的卧室也修葺一新。三层楼上的藻井前些年被美术界人士广为临摹，称其为抽象的“世界观”图，如今已重新描绘。中部为藏式建筑风格，472个石板佛精雕细琢。上部为印度风格。五层楼上，象征仙女卓玛、16罗汉和四大金刚的41根柱子也全部复原。
    负责监督维修工程的（桑耶所在地）扎囊县县委宣传部部长旺久告诉记者，桑耶在历史上几经磨难，此番维修国家先后投入768.6万元人民币和价值440多万元人民币的黄金，设计、施工均循规蹈矩，以求恢复其原貌。
    记者还了解到，在西藏修复寺庙并非易事，以桑耶为例，仅四大林、八大洲所需琉璃瓦就要从山西、福建等地筹措。尽管如此，西藏自治区各级人民政府仍不懈地落实党的宗教政策，克服诸多困难，近10年来陆续维修、开放寺庙和大小经堂1400余所。
