To effectively promote the integration of science and technology with production, the Ministry of Mechanical and Electrical Industry recently formulated and released the relevant assessment standards for technological advancement in large and medium-sized enterprises within the industry. This is the first industry-specific technological advancement assessment standard in China.

The specific assessment criteria include nine indicators: annual technological advancement speed, the contribution of annual technological advancement to the growth rate of the enterprise's total output value, the proportion of new product output value, the rate of first-class products, the proportion of export product output value, the annual research and development funding ratio, the ratio of technical personnel, the annual realized benefits of rationalization suggestions per capita, and the average annual level of education and training received by employees. Each indicator uses internationally accepted or scientifically calculated methods suitable for China's national conditions.

The Ministry of Mechanical and Electrical Industry has decided that from now on, it will select 100 "Advanced Enterprises in Mechanical and Electrical Industry Technological Advancement" annually based on the above indicators. It will also request local financial departments to grant these advanced enterprises a tax exemption equivalent to 1 to 2 months of total wages as an incentive. For those enterprise leaders who do not prioritize technological advancement, leading to product aging, low production efficiency, and poor economic benefits, and for those enterprise leaders who continue to produce products that the state has announced should be phased out or fail to achieve a 50% or higher rate of localization for introduced technologies within the contract period, they will be subject to criticism or dismissal.

　　机电部门制订考核标准
    据新华社北京11月28日电　（记者姜在忠）为有效地促进科学技术与生产的结合，机电部近日制定并公布了本行业大中企业技术进步的有关考核标准。这是我国的第一个行业技术进步考核标准。
    具体考核内容包括9项指标，即：年技术进步速度、年技术进步对企业总产值增长速度的贡献、新产品产值率、优等品率、出口产品产值率、年研究开发资金比率、科技人员比率、人均合理化建议年实现效益、职工平均年受教育提高程度。对每项指标的考核，分别采用了国际通用或适合我国国情的科学计算方法。
    机电部决定，今后每年都以以上指标为条件，评选出100家“机电工业技术进步先进企业”，并商请当地财政部门给予先进企业1至2个月工资总额的免税奖金额度，以资鼓励。对于那些不重视企业技术进步，导致产品老化、企业生产效率低、经济效益极差的企业领导，对于那些继续生产国家公布的淘汰产品的企业领导和在合同期内使引进技术国产化率达不到50％以上的企业领导，将给予批评或撤职处分。
