Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach recently falsely claimed that the assertion that Vietnam has troops stationed in Cambodia is merely a "pretext manufactured by China" to continue providing military aid to the Cambodian resistance forces to wage "civil war." Nguyen Co Thach demands that China and relevant countries immediately "stop aiding" the resistance forces and calls for a ceasefire and an end to the "civil war" among Cambodian factions. Vietnamese media outlets have recently not only denied the fact that Vietnamese troops are stationed in Cambodia but also propagandized that the Vietnamese army's invasion of Cambodia was supposedly a "justified self-defense," and that their withdrawal is a "triumphant return home."

The fact that Vietnam still has a large number of invading troops in Cambodia is not a "pretext" manufactured by anyone; it is an ironclad fact. The revelations by Prince Norodom Sihanouk and resistance forces, and the recent capture of a batch of Vietnamese soldiers on the battlefield, are all strong evidence of Vietnam's troops in Cambodia.

Examining Vietnam's aforementioned propaganda, its purpose is to achieve three transformations: first, to transform illegal invasion into "justified self-defense"; second, to transform aggression and anti-aggression war into "civil war"; third, to transform international support for the Cambodian people's anti-Vietnamese war into international support for the Khmer people waging "civil war." The ultimate goal of these transformations is for the Heng Samrin regime to permanently hold power, and for Vietnam to permanently control Cambodia.

International observers have long seen through Vietnam's schemes and have publicly supported Prince Norodom Sihanouk's principled stance: after Vietnam's announced so-called "final withdrawal," Vietnam's nature as the creator and aggressor of the Cambodian problem does not change; the nature of the Cambodian people's anti-Vietnamese war does not change; and the international community's stance of continuing to aid the Cambodian resistance forces will not change.

Nguyen Co Thach is a diplomat skilled in petty maneuvers. Now, his "three transformations" tactics may have changed in form, but their essence of invading Cambodia remains unchanged. The 11-year practice of the Cambodian war has made people wiser. There are few people who applaud Vietnam's sleight of hand, but its deceptiveness still exists. Therefore, it is necessary to remind everyone: beware of being deceived!

    越南的“三变”手法
    新华社记者　陈力
    越南外长阮基石近日诬称，关于越在柬埔寨留有军队的说法只是中国“制造的借口”以便继续给柬抵抗力量提供军援打“内战”。阮基石要求中国和有关国家立即“停止援助”抵抗力量，要求柬各派停火和停止“内战”。越报刊近日来不但抵赖越藏兵于柬的事实，而且宣扬越军当年侵柬是所谓“正当自卫”，如今撤军则是“凯旋归国”云云。
    越南在柬埔寨仍留有大量侵略军，这不是任何人制造出来的“借口”，而是铁一般的事实。西哈努克亲王和抵抗力量人士所作的揭露，一批越南士兵最近在战场上被俘获，都是越南藏兵于柬的有力证据。
    透视越南上述宣传，其目的在于实现三变：一是变非法入侵为“正当自卫”；二是变侵略与反侵略战争为“内战”；三是变国际支援柬人民抗越战争为国际社会支持高棉人打“内战”。这些的最终目的是：韩桑林政权永久独揽大权，越南永久统治柬埔寨。
    国际有识之士早已洞察越南的图谋，并公开声援西哈努克亲王的严正立场：在越南宣布所谓“最后撤军”之后，越南作为柬问题的制造者和侵略者的性质不变；柬人民抗越战争的性质不变；国际社会继续援助柬抵抗力量的立场不会改变。
    阮基石是善于搞小动作的外交家，如今，他表演的“三变”手法，形式变了，其侵柬的本质不变。11年的柬埔寨战争的实践使世人聪明起来，为越南变戏法叫好的人寥寥，但其欺骗性也还存在，故还必须提醒一句：谨防上当！
