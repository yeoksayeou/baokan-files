    A Shanghai Barge Encounters Disaster in the Bohai Gulf

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 7th - A barge from the Shanghai Port Barge Transportation Company with a load capacity of 4,359.7 tons, the "Jinshan," encountered a typhoon at around 00:30 on the night of October 31st in the Bohai Gulf and has since gone missing. Shanghai's relevant authorities have preliminarily judged that the "Jinshan" has met with disaster.

    The "Jinshan" had departed from Tianjin's Tanggu New Port at 14:30 on October 30th after loading coal and was on its way back to Shanghai. At 00:30 on October 31st, the Shanghai Coast Radio Station received an urgent telegram from the "Jinshan" reporting that it had encountered a 10-level strong wind. Subsequently, the barge transportation company sent urgent telegrams every half hour to contact the "Jinshan," but received no response. Upon hearing the news, leaders from the Ministry of Communications and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government paid great attention and immediately arranged search measures. They also requested the assistance of port and maritime supervision departments in Yantai, Dalian, and Tianjin. Under the organization of the China Maritime Search and Rescue Center, the navy, air force, and Yantai Salvage Bureau dispatched aircraft, vessels, and salvage ships to search in multiple directions. Due to the continuous large waves in the Bohai Gulf, the search work was extremely difficult.

    From November 1st to 5th, floating objects and 7 bodies were found in the sea areas around Changdao and Longkou in Shandong. After the accident, Zhang Yan, the director of the Shanghai Port Bureau, led a working group to Yantai Changdao to assist relevant departments in organizing the search. They have identified 7 bodies and confirmed that they are crew members of the "Jinshan." The search work is still ongoing.

    上海一驳船遇难渤海湾
    新华社上海11月7日电　上海港驳船运输公司的一艘载重量为4359.7吨的“金山”轮，于10月31日凌晨零时30分，在渤海湾突遇气旋风后下落不明，上海有关方面初步判断“金山”轮已经遇难。
    “金山”轮是10月30日下午2时30分从天津塘沽新港装煤后返沪的。31日零时30分，上海海岸电台收到“金山”轮发出突遇10级大风的加急电报，随后驳船运输公司每隔半小时发加急电报与“金山”轮联系，但一直未获回电。交通部和上海市人民政府领导闻讯后极为重视，立即部署寻找措施；同时，请山东的烟台，大连、天津等港口、海监部门协助寻找。在中国海上搜救中心的组织下，海军、空军、烟台救捞局派出飞机、舰艇、救捞船多方寻找。由于渤海湾海区风浪一直较大，搜寻工作极为艰苦。
    11月1日至5日在山东的长岛、龙口一带海域陆续发现漂浮物及7具遗体。
    事故发生后，上海港务局张燕局长率领的现场工作小组奔赴烟台长岛配合有关部门组织搜寻。他们已对7具遗体进行辨认，确认是“金山”轮船员。目前，搜寻工作仍在进行。
