Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 24th.

A unified campaign to eliminate the "six evils" began today in the capital, following the overall plan of "mobilizing the entire city, combining points and surfaces, and addressing both symptoms and root causes."

According to reports, in recent years, the "six evils" have threatened the public morality of Beijing residents. Issues such as prostitution, the production and distribution of obscene materials, and gambling have shown signs of spreading. The Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, in conjunction with the spirit of the Fifth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, have decided to mobilize social forces to eliminate the "six evils" as a practical matter of concern to the people. To this end, Beijing held an mobilization meeting this afternoon, attended by leaders of municipal departments, colleges and universities, and responsible officials from central government, State Council, and military units stationed in Beijing. Members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Li Xixian, and State Councilor and Mayor of Beijing Chen Xitong attended the meeting.

To ensure that this work is carried out in a planned, focused, and step-by-step manner, the city has identified three key stages of work during the unified campaign. The first stage, from today to the end of December, will focus on the ongoing "anti-pornography" campaign, concentrating on cracking down on prostitution, the production, sale, and distribution of obscene materials, and other illegal activities. The second stage, from next year's New Year to early February, will focus on cracking down on gambling ringleaders and those who use feudal superstitions to defraud people of their money. The third stage, before next year's May Day, will, based on the progress of the work, investigate and deal with prostitution issues one by one.

Beijing requires all government agencies, organizations, and enterprises to implement a responsibility system for eliminating the "six evils," strictly follow the law, and effectively correct and prevent the tendency of "fining instead of punishing" and "fining instead of detaining."

　　全市总动员建立责任制治标又治本
　　北京大张旗鼓扫“六害”
    本报北京11月24日讯　记者赵兴林报道：以“全市动员，点面结合，治标治本”为总体部署的扫除“六害”统一行动，今日起在首都拉开序幕。
    据介绍，近几年“六害”已危及北京人的公德意识，其中如卖淫嫖娼、制作贩卖传播淫秽物品和聚众赌博等有蔓延之势。市委、市政府结合学习十三届五中全会精神，把动员社会力量扫除“六害”，作为解决群众最关心的一件实事来办。为此，北京市今天下午召开了市属各部委办局和高校领导以及中央、国务院和部队驻京单位负责人参加的动员大会。中共中央政治局委员、北京市委书记李锡铭，国务委员、北京市市长陈希同等出席了会议。
    为了使这一工作有计划、有重点、有步骤地开展，全市确定在统一行动期间，集中抓好三个阶段的专项工作。第一阶段从今天到12月底，结合目前正在进行的“扫黄”工作，集中打击卖淫嫖娼和制作贩卖、传播淫秽物品的违法活动。第二阶段从明年元旦到2月上旬，集中打击赌头、赌棍和利用封建迷信手段诈骗钱财害人的违法犯罪分子。第三阶段在明年“五·一”之前，根据工作进展逐个查处卖淫嫖娼问题。
    北京市要求各机关、团体、企事业单位实行扫“六害”包干责任制，严格依法办事，切实纠正和防止“以罚代刑”和“以罚代拘”的偏向。
