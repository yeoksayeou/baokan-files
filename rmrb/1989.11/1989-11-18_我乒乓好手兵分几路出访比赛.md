Every early winter, Chinese table tennis players head to Europe to participate in a series of international competitions, aiming to train the team and familiarize themselves with European playing styles. This year is no exception, as the Chinese table tennis team will soon depart in several groups.

The group heading to the Hungarian Open has already left on November 13th. The male and female players in this group are mainly newcomers, including Wang Tao, Lü Lin, Fan Yiyong, Zhu Hongbing, Qiao Yunping, Gao Jun, Chen Zihua, and Ding Yaping. The Hungarian Open will be held from November 16th to 19th. After this tournament, the Chinese players will then proceed to Leningrad to participate in the Sovetskaya Kultura Newspaper Cup Open, which will be held from November 22nd to 27th.

Chen Zhibin, Ma Wenge, and Xie Chaoje, three male team stars, will be invited to participate in the French Grand Prix in late November. They will then travel to Finland and Sweden to join another group of teammates. The Finnish Open will be held from December 1st to 3rd, and the Swedish Open will be held from December 7th to 10th. These two opens have always been large in scale and high in level. The Chinese team's players for these two tournaments also include Chen Jing, Qiao Hong, Deng Yaping, Hu Xiaoxin, Wang Yonggang, and Zhang Lei.

Head coach Xu Shaofa will lead Chen Longcan, Wei Qingguang, and Yu Shentong to participate in the British Open, which will be held early next year.

The annual Hong Kong Tsuen Wan Sports Festival will be held later this month. Former world champion Jiang Jialiang and others, who have not been seen in a while, will go to perform exhibition matches.

It is understood that the Asia-Europe Table Tennis Challenge, which has been held for four consecutive years, will be discontinued next year. Whether it will be held in the future remains to be discussed further between the table tennis communities of the two continents.

    我乒乓好手兵分几路出访比赛
    本报讯　记者刘小明报道：每年初冬时节，我国乒乓球选手都要赴欧洲参加一系列国际比赛，锻炼队伍，熟悉欧式打法。今年也不例外，近期内中国乒乓球队兵分几路先后启程。
    参加匈牙利公开赛的一路已于本月13日出发，男女战将以新手为主，有王涛、吕林、范义勇、朱红兵、乔云萍、高军、陈子荷、丁亚萍。匈牙利公开赛定于16日至19日举行。这批中国选手随后还将去列宁格勒参加22日至27日举行的苏维埃文化报杯公开赛。
    陈志斌、马文革、谢超杰三位男队好手将应邀参加11月下旬的法国大奖赛，然后转赴芬兰、瑞典，与另一路队友会合。芬兰公开赛定于12月1日至3日举行，瑞典公开赛定于12月7日至10日举行。这两个公开赛历来规模较大，水平也很高。中国队出征这两个赛事的战将还有陈静、乔红、邓亚萍、胡小新、王永刚、张雷等。
    许绍发总教练率陈龙灿、韦晴光、于沈潼三人，将在晚些时候参加明年年初举行的英国公开赛。
    一年一度的香港荃湾体育节本月下旬举行。久未露面的前世界冠军江嘉良等将去表演比赛。
    据了解，已举办了四届的亚欧乒乓球对抗赛明年停止，以后是否还办，有待两大洲乒乓球界进一步磋商。
