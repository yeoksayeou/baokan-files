Two counties in Shanxi link earthquake relief with cadres' performance evaluation

	Reporters Yan Xiaoming of this newspaper and Chi Maohua of Xinhua News Agency report from Datong: Shanxi's Hunyuan and Guangling counties have linked their earthquake relief work with the evaluation of Party members and cadres. Those who have made outstanding contributions in the relief work have been promoted, given raises, and commended; those who have abandoned their posts, failed to return on time, or performed poorly have been administratively disciplined and criticized in public. So far, 2 people have been promoted, 3 have been dismissed, and 4 have been criticized in public.

	During the earthquake in Shanxi on October 18, Li Detao, the Party branch secretary of Chixianguan Village in Shagutou Town, Hunyuan County, actively organized the villagers to evacuate and bravely rescued 3 elderly, weak, and sick villagers from a collapsing building. Despite the village's houses being completely destroyed, all 1,500-plus villagers were unharmed. After the disaster, he actively organized the villagers to help themselves. The Hunyuan County Party Committee promoted Li Detao to deputy secretary of the Shagutou Town Party Committee and gave him a one-level salary increase.

	In this county, Deputy Town Head Jing Zhong of Dawa Township was left in charge while the town head and secretary were attending a meeting in the county. During the earthquake, he abandoned his post and was absent for several days. The Hunyuan County Party Committee recommended that the People's Congress remove him from his position and issued a public criticism throughout the county. This county also had 4 other cadres who abandoned their posts and received public criticism from the county committee.

	Liu Daming, the head of Liujiagou Village Committee in Liangzhuang Township, Guangling County, was present in the village but abandoned his leadership role in the earthquake relief efforts, showing no concern for the village's disaster situation, leaving 400-plus people homeless. The Liangzhuang Township Government dismissed him from his position.

    山西两县结合抗震救灾考察干部
    有功者升　失职者撤
    本报大同11月4日电　本报记者阎晓明、新华社记者池茂花报道：山西浑源、广灵两县结合抗震救灾工作实绩认真考察党员、干部，对在抗震救灾工作中做出显著成绩者给予提拔、晋级、表彰；对擅离职守、逾期不归、表现不好的给予行政处理并通报批评。目前，已有2人被提拔，3人被撤职，4人受通报批评。
    在山西10月18日的地震中，浑源县沙圪坨镇赤泥泉村党支部书记李德田积极组织群众转移，并冒险从危房中背出3名老弱病残村民，在全村房屋遭受毁灭性破坏的情况下，全村1500多村民无一伤亡。灾后他积极组织灾民自救。浑源县委提拔李德田为沙圪坨镇党委副书记，并予以晋升一级工资。
    这个县大洼乡副乡长靖忠因书记、乡长在县里开会，安排他主持全乡工作。地震发生时，他擅离职守，数日不归，浑源县委建议人大免去他副乡长职务，并通报全县。这个县还有另外4名干部因擅离职守，受到县委通报批评。
    广灵县梁庄乡刘家沟村委会主任刘大明人虽在村，但放弃对抗震救灾的领导，毫不过问全村的灾情，使400多人陷入无家可归的困境。梁庄乡政府给予他撤销职务的处分。
