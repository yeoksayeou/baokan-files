Title: A Major Social Problem in the United States—Homelessness

In American cities, whether it is the capital Washington, the financial center New York, the Midwestern hub Chicago, or the northwestern city of Seattle, one often encounters groups of wandering, homeless poor people.

From the reporter's residence to the United Nations Headquarters, it takes no more than 10 minutes on foot. Along the way, there is a public tennis court. Every time I pass by, I almost always see a few men and women busy setting up their "homes" at the edge of the court. These are makeshift shelters cobbled together from discarded cardboard boxes, not even as high as one's shoulders, with air vents and small doors cut out. Needless to say, one has to hunch over to get in and out. In the chilly autumn wind, the cardboard shacks look shaky and ready to collapse.

While waiting for a night train at Pennsylvania Station in downtown New York, police officers frequently come to check tickets, and those without tickets are immediately driven away, supposedly to prevent homeless people from staying there overnight. The reporter saw a woman who seemed mentally unstable arguing with a man. When the train pulled into Newark, New Jersey, a policeman with a gun at his waist came and took the woman off the train—she was apparently another homeless wanderer.

In fact, there are already millions of homeless people in the United States today, and their numbers are increasing. City parks, streets, highways, and abandoned cars under bridges are all their shelters. According to media reports, this nationwide social problem currently has three trends:

— What was once thought to be a problem only in "urban areas" has now spread to small and medium-sized towns, and even rural areas. Recently, a survey in the United States showed that in 26 major rural residential areas, the number of people seeking emergency housing has increased by 5% to 100%.

— The number of homeless families is rising. In some large cities, the proportion of families without homes among the homeless is more than one-third. For example, in Chicago, 60% of the temporary shelter beds are occupied by homeless families.

— The number of low-wage workers who are homeless is increasing. Although they have jobs, they cannot afford the high rent and have to hide in temporary shelters or sleep on the streets.

The phenomenon of homelessness has deep and complex social and economic causes. Facing this problem, the past few federal governments have had no effective solutions. Although the White House and state authorities have repeatedly expressed their intention to increase housing subsidies, for the ever-growing number of homeless people, this is like a drop in the bucket and cannot fundamentally solve the problem. Some high-ranking officials in the federal housing department have even used housing development plan approvals to engage in corruption and make huge profits. Moreover, in some large cities, it is estimated that 30% to 50% of the homeless are drug addicts, alcoholics, or mentally ill, which makes it not just a housing problem. A recent pessimistic statement from an American social worker is that we have been working on this issue for 25 years and may need another 25 years to solve it.

### 美国一大社会难题——无家可归者

    美国一大社会难题——
    无家可归者
    本报记者　仓立德
    在美国各大城市，无论是首都华盛顿、金融中心纽约、中西部重镇芝加哥，还是西北角的西雅图，不时会遇到一群群四处流浪、居无定所的穷人。
    从记者的住地步行到联合国大厦用不了10分钟，路旁有个公共网球场。每次往返，几乎总能看见几位男女正在球场边忙忙碌碌地安置自己的“家”。那是用废弃的硬纸包装箱勉强拼凑起来的，高不及肩，外面掏了通气孔和小门。不用说，出入都得佝着身子。在萧瑟的秋风中，几座纸棚显得摇摇欲坠。
    在纽约市中心的宾夕法尼亚火车站等候夜车时，巡警不时前来盘查人们的车票，无票者被立即赶走，据说是不让流浪者在那里过夜。记者见到一位精神似乎不大正常的妇女同一位男子争执起来，上了车恰巧和她同在一节车厢。检票员验过票后，列车驶进宾州纽瓦克站。此时忽见一名腰间别着手枪的警察走来，将那位女士带下车——看来又是个浪迹天涯的无家可归者。
    事实上，类似这样的无家可归者在当今美国已有数百万，而且还在日益增多，城市的公园街头、高速公路、桥下弃置的破汽车……都是他们的栖身处。据报刊披露，这一全国性社会问题目前有3个趋势：
    ——过去认为无家可归者只是一种“都市病”，但现在已蔓延至中小城镇，甚至乡间。最近，美国的一份调查报告显示，在26个主要乡村居民区中，要求提供紧急住所的人增加了5—100％。
    ——无家可归的家庭激增。在某些大城市，无房户在无家可归者中的比例高达1／3以上。例如芝加哥，临时住所的床位被无房家庭占用了60％。
    ——无家可归的下层低薪者数量不断增加。他们虽有工作，却无力支付昂贵的房租，只好在临时住所藏身或露宿街头。
    无家可归现象有着深刻而复杂的社会和经济原因。面对这一难题，近几届联邦政府均无良策。尽管白宫及各州当局不断表示要增加建房补贴，但对日益庞大的无家可归者队伍来说只是杯水车薪，不可能从根本上解决问题。一些联邦住房部高官甚至还利用住房发展计划审批权营私舞弊，大发横财。何况在一些大城市的无家可归者中，估计有三成到一半人为吸毒者、酗酒者、精神病患者，这就不单单是个住房问题了。一位美国社会工作者最近悲观地表示，为解决这个难题我们已经努力了25年，很可能还得再干25年。
