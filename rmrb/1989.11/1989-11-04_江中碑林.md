The lush and verdant Jiujiang's Jiao Mountain is like a jade floating on the river; the stones and inscriptions hidden among the green trees are like artistic treasures carved on the jade.

Jiao Mountain is famous for its stele forest, a reputation it has held since ancient times. In 1960, the stele forest was rebuilt, and in recent years, it has been further expanded and renovated. The stele forest is divided into two parts: the stele garden and the cliff inscriptions.

Upon arriving, walk east from Dinghui Temple for a few dozen steps, and you will quietly see the newly built, exquisite gatehouse and an ancient, rustic brick wall with the characters "Pillar in the Midstream" inscribed on it. The stele garden is right in front of you.

The stele garden consists of three halls and courtyards with distinct styles, divided into three parts: historical records, literary works, and calligraphy. The stele collection in the garden and the garden itself are meticulously designed, allowing different visitors to enjoy different artistic pleasures, whether it be admiring the stele while strolling through the garden or strolling through the garden while admiring the stele. The historical records part consists of three halls, each dedicated to the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Modern inscriptions are scattered on the walls outside the halls. Among the Tang dynasty stele, there stands a giant stele carried by a turtle, measuring 213 centimeters in height and 87 centimeters in width. The stele head features four intertwined dragons with their heads hanging down in a circular shape. The stele is inscribed with 33 rows of regular script, each row containing 75 characters. The calligraphy is precise and vigorous, worthy of being called a "masterpiece of the early Tang dynasty," and is the most complete Tang dynasty stele in Jiangsu.

The literary works part is entirely embedded in the walls of the corridor. In the middle of the corridor, there is a courtyard with green trees and red flowers, creating a graceful scene. Walking along the corridor, you can admire a poem by Ming dynasty scholar Yang Jisheng in the Yanzhi Pavilion, which was inspired by his own name and the name of the mountain: "Yangzi mourns for Yangzi, Jiao Mountain unintentionally merges with Jiao Mountain." Turning the corner, at the midpoint of the corridor in the Zhiting Pavilion, you can admire the "Zhiting Sequence Calligraphy."

The cliff inscriptions are on the rocks of the western mountain. As you climb, you can admire them. There is an inscribed stone on a protruding rock, which is a beautiful micro-travelogue by Lu You. There is also a modern work with a similar patriotic spirit as Lu You's inscribed stone, carved on a rock facing the river, issuing a heroic call: "To abolish the unequal treaty, the cry resounds throughout the country, come here to rest temporarily, and travel around the world." This was inscribed by the Chinese Bar Association in 1920.

    江中碑林
    陆潮洪
    苍翠幽深的镇江焦山，宛如浮江碧玉；绿树掩映的块块碑刻，似镌刻在碧玉上的艺术瑰宝。
    焦山藏碑，古代就蜚声江南。1960年重建的碑林，近年又扩建整修。碑林分碑园与摩崖两部分。上岸，从定慧寺东行数十步，就悄然可见新修的精巧门楼与一道镶嵌“中流砥柱”四个大字的古朴砖墙。碑园即在眼前。
    碑园由三组风格各异的厅堂与庭园组成史料、文苑、书法三大部分。碑藏园中、碑园浑然的精心设计，使不同游人都可获得不同的艺术享受，或赏碑兼游园，或游园兼赏碑。史料部分共三个厅室，分别唐、宋、元明，清代，近代碑刻则散布室外墙上。唐碑中，矗立一座龟驮巨碑，高213厘米，宽87厘米，碑首四龙互缠，龙首下垂成圆肩，碑上刻楷书33行，每行75字，书体精严遒劲，堪称“初唐妙品”，是江苏最完整的唐碑。
    文苑部分全嵌在回廊墙上，回廊中间，是绿树红花，景致优雅的庭园。信步回廊，可在仰止轩内观赏明杨继盛的一首椒山诗，诗作由作者因本人字号与山名同音由感而发：“杨子怀人度杨子，椒山无意合椒山。”拐弯，至回廊中段芝亭，可观赏《芝亭序帖》。
    摩崖石刻在西山山石上，边登山边观赏。有一块在突起山石上的题名石刻，是陆游的一篇精美微型游记。还有一块也与陆游题名石刻同样充溢着爱国激情的近代作品，刻在一块面江的岩石上，发出壮烈呼号：“为废不平约，呼号满神州，来此暂偃息，行作世界游。”这是1920年当时的中国律师协会留刻的。
