On the coast of the Yellow Sea, at the foot of the picturesque Qingshan in Qingdao, stands a four-star international hotel—the Haidian Grand Hotel. Li Mengzhou, who is over sixty years old, serves as the chairman of this hotel. "Haidian" is a Sino-foreign joint venture. Li Mengzhou is known for his thrift and meticulous management.

1.45 million vs. 700,000

The four-star tourist hotel Haidian Grand Hotel, invested by eight shareholders from Qingdao, Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore, began its first phase of construction in September 1986.

For a large-scale project, loans are inevitable. According to the pre-signed joint venture contract, the registered capital of Haidian Grand Hotel Co., Ltd. is 7.5 million US dollars. The total investment for the first phase of the project exceeds 20 million US dollars. Excluding the registered capital, the remaining 12.5 million US dollars must all be borrowed from the bank. It was estimated that "Haidian" would have to pay 1.45 million US dollars in interest during the construction period. This is a huge expense!

Can the funds be used more effectively to reduce the interest payments?

Li Mengzhou started calculating. He assigned someone to list the monthly construction expenses according to the contract: first, borrow only what is needed; second, deposit part of the 7.5 million US dollars in fixed-term deposits and part in current deposits; third, accelerate the construction to avoid delays, etc. Through various measures, only 700,000 US dollars in interest was paid, saving approximately half of the estimated amount.

30 mu of "dead land" vs. 30 mu of "live land"

"Such a large project, wasting 1% or saving 1% makes a difference, but this is not a small number."

"Haidian" acquired a total of 60 mu of land, with the first phase of the project using only 30 mu, leaving the remaining 30 mu idle.

After the company was established, foreign shareholders and board members frequently came to Qingdao to inspect the project or hold meetings; Japanese managers also came to "Haidian" to prepare for the opening. The staff of the Hong Kong office of the P & O Architects and Engineers, who designed the "Haidian" project, came to Qingdao once a month to coordinate the construction site. According to regulations, their accommodation fees were to be borne by the hotel, amounting to approximately 400,000 yuan. Additionally, after the construction started, foreign contractors lived far from the site, making work inconvenient; the service staff, who were receiving training from Japanese managers, also needed a place for practice and training.

Li Mengzhou again took out his "abacus," focusing on the idle 30 mu of land. Suddenly, this patch of overgrown grassland came to life in his eyes: build temporary guest rooms, a dining hall, and a simple multifunctional activity hall. His suggestion was immediately approved by the board.

The temporary guest rooms, dining hall, and simple multifunctional activity hall that were built also had good facilities, and the guests were quite satisfied. Foreign shareholders, board members, Japanese managers, and the design staff from the P & O office who came to Qingdao every month all stayed in the temporary guest rooms on the construction site. This alone saved approximately 200,000 yuan. The temporary dining hall could handle the hotel's external hospitality, saving 40% of the entertainment expenses. Moreover, both Chinese and foreign workers had a place for entertainment and rest. The 30 mu of "dead land" came to life.

Two jiao vs. one jiao five fen

"Haidian" has a principle for purchasing goods: if it can be bought domestically, it should not be bought from abroad; if it can be bought cheaply, it should not be bought expensively.

The cost of matches for such a large hotel is almost negligible, but Li Mengzhou did not overlook this. A large hotel, from guest rooms to dining halls, consumes a large amount of matches. Purchasing from a match factory in the city costs two jiao per box. Li Mengzhou did not buy them. He made every effort to contact relevant personnel and decided to use loose matches and make them by hand, saving five fen per box. Over a year, a significant amount was saved!

Li Mengzhou often told the staff that thrift is a virtue, and this is also the case abroad. By following the law of value, saving funds, and improving efficiency, more overseas investors can be attracted.

The second phase of the "Haidian" project is under construction, and Li Mengzhou continues to calculate with his iron "abacus"…

    精打细算的当家人
    ——青岛海天大酒店董事长李梦周节约二三事
    宋学春　梁清凡
    黄海之滨，秀丽的青岛湛山脚下，矗立着一座国际四星级大酒店——“海天大酒店”。
    年逾花甲的李梦周担任这家酒店的董事长。“海天”是一家中外合资企业。李梦周勤俭节约，精打细算，在这里出了名。
    145万与70万
    由中国青岛、香港、澳门和新加坡8家股东投资兴建的四星级旅游饭店海天大酒店，第一期工程于1986年9月破土动工。
    搞一项规模较大的工程，是免不了贷款的。根据事先签署的合资合同，海天大酒店有限公司的股本为750万美元。一期工程总投资突破2000万美元，除去股本，其余1250万美元全部要靠银行贷款。经估算，“海天”在建期间，要支付银行利息145万美元。这真是一笔巨大开支！
    能不能把资金用好，少付点利息？
    李梦周拨着他的“算盘”。他找专人，依照合同把每月的工程开支计划列清，一是用多少就贷多少；二是将750万美元股本，一部分做定期存款，一部分做活期存款；三是抓紧施工，不拖工期等等。通过各种措施，只支付利息70万美元，比预计节省约1／2。
    30亩“死地”与30亩“活地”
    “这么大工程，浪费1％和节约1％都有可能，但这决不是小数字。”
    “海天”共征地60亩，一期工程仅用30亩，其余30亩暂时闲着。
    公司成立后，国外股东、董事会成员经常前来青岛考察工程或开会；日本管理人员，也前来“海天”做开业前的准备工作。担任“海天”工程设计的巴马丹拿建筑及工程师香港事务所人员，每月要来青岛做一次工地统筹工作。按规定，他们的房费由酒店承担，仅此一项，如租住宾馆需开支40万元左右。另外，工程开工后，国外承建商住宾馆远离工地，工作不方便；正在接受日本管理人员培训的服务员，也需要有一个实习和训练场合。
    李梦周又打起他的“铁算盘”，两眼盯着闲置的30亩地。突然，这块长满荒草的“死地”，在他眼里“活”了起来：盖临时客房、餐厅、简易多功能活动厅。他的意见一提出，立即得到董事会赞成。
    盖起的临时客房、餐厅、简易多功能活动厅，里边的设备也不错，客人们颇为满意。来青岛的海外股东、董事会成员，日本管理人员和每月来青岛的巴马丹拿事务所的设计人员，都住在工地临时客房。仅此一项，节省开支约20万元。临时餐厅可自己解决酒店的对外交际，又节省应酬费40％。此外，中外工人也有了娱乐和休息场所。30亩“死地”变“活”了。
    二毛钱与一毛五
    “海天”买东西，有个原则：在国内能买到的不到国外买；能买到便宜的，决不买贵的。
    火柴的费用，对这么一家大酒店来说，那简直是
  一笔微不足道的支出，不过，这也没从李梦周的“算盘”漏掉。一个大酒店从客房到餐厅，需要消耗大量火柴，到本市一家火柴厂购买，价格二毛钱一盒。李梦周没买。他千方百计同有关人员联系，决定用散装火柴，手工制作，这样每盒可节约五分钱。一年下来，省了一笔不小的开支哩！
    李梦周常对工作人员讲，勤俭节约是一种美德，这在国外也是如此。按价值规律办事，节约了资金，提高了效益，就可以吸引更多的海外人士来投资。
    “海天”二期工程正在紧张施工，李梦周继续打着他的铁“算盘”……
