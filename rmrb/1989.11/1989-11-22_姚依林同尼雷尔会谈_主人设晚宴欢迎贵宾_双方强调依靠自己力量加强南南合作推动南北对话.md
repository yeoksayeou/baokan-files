Today morning, Vice Premier Yao Yilin met with the Chairman of the South Commission and Chairman of the Tanzanian Revolutionary Party, Julius K. Nyerere, at the Great Hall of the People.

During the meeting, Nyerere first briefed the situation regarding the South Commission. He said that the South Commission was established in July 1987, with the purpose of strengthening South-South cooperation, promoting South-North dialogue, and reforming the existing international economic order. He emphasized that Southern countries must rely on their people and strive for self-reliance in order to achieve their own development. At the same time, Southern countries should strengthen unity and cooperation among themselves, that is, strengthen South-South cooperation. Of course, South-North dialogue should also be strengthened. Nyerere said that the South Commission is scheduled to submit its final report in the spring of next year and conclude its work. However, he proposed the establishment of a secretariat for the South Commission to continue the work of the South Commission.

Vice Premier Yao Yilin thanked the guest for the detailed introduction to the South Commission and expressed appreciation for the work of the South Commission led by Nyerere. He said that the specific issues raised by the Commission can be further discussed.

When Yao Yilin briefed Nyerere on the domestic situation, he emphasized that over the past decade, the experience has been that we must open up to the outside world to accelerate the development of our economy; however, while opening up, we must also strengthen self-reliance. Our policy is to rely mainly on self-reliance and to seek external aid as a supplement. As for reform, this is the perfection and development of the socialist system itself, and not the pursuit of capitalism. The socialist system needs reform because it is a new system that needs to solve many unprecedented problems. He said that we must proceed from reality, develop social productive forces, and constantly improve and supplement this new system in practice. However, this improvement and supplementation is based on the summary and absorption of past experiences and lessons, and is absolutely not a complete negation of history or the past.

Yao Yilin also briefed the guest on the situation of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. He said that the plenary session passed a resolution to continue to rectify and manage the economy and deepen reforms. The whole Party has a unified understanding and is united.

In the evening, Yao Yilin held a banquet to warmly welcome Chairman Nyerere. Yao Yilin said that Chairman Nyerere is an outstanding statesman of our time. He, together with our country's older generation of revolutionaries such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping, created and nurtured Sino-Tanzanian friendship. The Chinese people remember his contributions to this. He pointed out that since the 1980s, the drawbacks of the existing international economic system have become increasingly apparent, seriously hindering the development of developing countries. Developing countries must rely on their own strength to reform the unjust and unreasonable international economic order, strengthen South-South cooperation, and promote South-North dialogue. China will continue to support and cooperate with Third World countries, and work together for common development.

Chairman Nyerere said that after achieving political liberation, we must develop our countries, and the way of construction must be able to maintain our own characteristics. He pointed out that many important decisions in the current international economy are made without our influence, while we make up the majority of humanity. Therefore, Southern countries can only hope to succeed through joint efforts. As long as we are united and work together, we can influence the decision-making process of the world. He stressed that we must take action to safeguard our interests.

　　姚依林同尼雷尔会谈
　　主人设晚宴欢迎贵宾
　　双方强调依靠自己力量加强南南合作推动南北对话
    本报北京十一月二十一日讯　记者周象光报道：今天上午，国务院代总理姚依林在人民大会堂同南方委员会主席、坦桑尼亚革命党主席朱利叶斯·克·尼雷尔举行了会谈。
    会谈中，尼雷尔首先通报了有关南方委员会的主要情况。他说，南方委员会成立于一九八七年七月，其宗旨为加强南南合作，推动南北对话，改革现行的国际经济秩序。他强调，南方国家为了谋求自身的发展，必须依靠人民，自力更生；同时，南方国家要加强相互之间的团结与合作，即加强南南合作。当然，南北之间也应加强对话。尼雷尔说，南方委员会定于明年春季提出最后报告后，结束工作。但他设想成立一个南方委员会的秘书处，继续推进南方委员会的工作。
    姚依林代总理感谢客人详细介绍了南方委员会的情况，并对尼雷尔领导的南方委员会的工作表示赞赏。他说，委员会提出的有关具体问题，可进一步讨论。
    姚依林向尼雷尔介绍国内情况时强调指出，我们十年来的体会是，对外必须开放，以加速我国的经济发展；但在开放的同时，也必须加强自力更生。我们的方针是，以自力更生为主，以争取外援为辅。至于改革，这是社会主义制度本身的完善和发展，而决不是搞资本主义。社会主义制度之所以需要改革，是因为它是一种崭新的制度，需要解决许多史无前例的新问题。他说，要从实际出发，发展社会生产力，并在实践中不断完善和补充这种新制度，但这种完善和补充是在总结和吸取以往的经验、教训的基础上进行的，而绝不是对历史、对过去的全盘否定。
    姚依林还向客人通报了中共十三届五中全会的情况。他说，全会通过了决定，继续整顿治理经济和深化改革，全党认识一致，团结一致。
    晚上，姚依林举行宴会，对尼雷尔主席表示热烈的欢迎。姚依林说，尼雷尔主席是当代卓越的政治家，他同毛泽东、周恩来、邓小平等我国老一辈革命家一起缔造和培育了中坦友谊。中国人民铭记着尼雷尔为此作出的贡献。他指出，八十年代以来，现行国际经济体制中的弊端日益显露，严重阻碍发展中国家的发展进程。发展中国家要改革不公正、不合理的国际经济秩序，不可能依靠任何人的恩赐，只能依靠自己的力量，加强南南合作，推进南北对话。中国将继续与第三世界国家相互支持，团结合作，共同发展。
    尼雷尔主席说，在赢得政治解放以后，我们必须发展我们的国家，而建设的方式须能保持各自的特色。他指出，当前国际经济中许多重要决策都是在没有我们的影响下作出的，而我们占人类的大多数。因此，南方国家只有共同努力才有希望。只要团结一致，共同努力，就能影响世界的决策进程。他强调，我们必须行动起来，捍卫我们的利益。
