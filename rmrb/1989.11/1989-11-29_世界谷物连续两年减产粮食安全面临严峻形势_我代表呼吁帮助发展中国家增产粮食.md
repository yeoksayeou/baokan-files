Chinese Minister of Agriculture He Kang recently spoke at the 25th session of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) held here, calling on all countries with the capacity to provide aid to assist developing countries in increasing grain production and ensuring global food security.

He Kang pointed out that world grain production has declined for two consecutive years, grain reserves have sharply decreased, and global food security is once again facing a severe situation. Negotiations to improve international agricultural trade have not made the expected progress. Many developing countries are burdened by debt issues and lack the necessary technology for agricultural development, facing numerous obstacles in increasing grain and agricultural production. The agricultural ecological environment is deteriorating worldwide.

He Kang said that in the face of the current challenges in agriculture, first, efforts must be made to increase grain production, especially to help developing countries increase grain production. Second, efforts should be made to promote the success of international agricultural trade negotiations as soon as possible. Third, the initiative to "protect and renew agricultural resources" should be seriously implemented in agricultural development.

He Kang said that the FAO, as a major agricultural specialized agency within the United Nations system, has made important contributions to promoting global food and agricultural development.

He Kang also introduced the significant achievements of China's rural economic reforms in his speech.

　　世界谷物连续两年减产粮食安全面临严峻形势
　　我代表呼吁帮助发展中国家增产粮食
    新华社罗马电　中国农业部长何康最近在这里举行的联合国粮农组织第25届大会上发言，呼吁一切有能力提供捐助的国家帮助发展中国家增加粮食生产，确保世界粮食安全。
    何康指出，世界谷物连续两年减产，谷物储备锐减，世界粮食安全又一次面临严峻的形势；为改善农产品贸易的国际谈判仍然没有取得应有的进展；许多发展中国家受着债务问题的困扰和缺少发展农业所必需的技术，在发展粮食和农业生产中遇到重重障碍；世界范围内的农业生态环境正在日益恶化。
    何康说，面对当前农业形势的挑战，第一，要抓紧粮食生产；特别要帮助发展中国家增加粮食生产；第二，努力促进农产品贸易的国际谈判尽早获得成功；第三，把“保护和更新农业资源”的倡议认真贯彻到发展农业的行动中去。
    何康说，粮农组织作为联合国系统内的一个主要农业专门机构，为促进世界粮食和农业发展作出了重要贡献。
    何康在发言中还介绍了我国农村经济改革取得的重大成果。
