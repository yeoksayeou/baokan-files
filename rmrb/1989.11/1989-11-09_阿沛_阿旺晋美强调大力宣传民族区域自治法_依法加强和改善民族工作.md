Alpu Jinmei Emphasizes the Promotion of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy and Strengthening and Improving Ethnic Work Through the Law

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 8th – (Reporters Zhang Yinxu and Zheng Qingdong) Alpu Jinmei, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Committee on Ethnic Affairs, emphasized at the recently concluded national conference of chairpersons of the ethnic affairs committees of provincial, autonomous region, and municipal people's congresses that efforts should be made to promote the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy nationwide and strengthen and improve ethnic work through legal construction.

Alpu Jinmei stressed in his speech that implementing the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy is the common responsibility of all levels of state organs and all ethnic groups. He said that to fully implement the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, the following three aspects of work must be grasped at present: First, the State Council and relevant departments should promptly formulate detailed regulations or specific measures for implementing the Law; second, ethnic autonomous areas should formulate autonomous regulations and single-item regulations in accordance with the principles of the Law, especially the five autonomous regions should expedite the formulation of their autonomous regulations; third, provinces with multiple ethnic groups should formulate measures and steps for implementing the Law.

Alpu Jinmei pointed out that the National People's Congress Committee on Ethnic Affairs is a specialized committee of the state power organ, responsible for promoting the implementation of the Law. It should push relevant departments to formulate supporting regulations for implementing the Law, and assist the people's congresses and their standing committees in strengthening legal supervision and work supervision.

Alpu Jinmei said that efforts should be made to strengthen the promotion and education of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy. He said that through studying the law, efforts should be made to improve legal awareness, establish and strengthen the concept of implementing autonomy through the law, and exercise the powers granted by the Law.

Alpu Jinmei finally emphasized that stability and unity are needed for the development and construction of the entire country, which is the overall situation. Only by acting in accordance with the law can true stability and unity be achieved. The Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy is a fundamental law related to the overall situation of ethnic regions. Only by truly implementing the Law can ethnic regions truly achieve and guarantee stability and unity, and only then can the great unity of all ethnic groups in the country be truly realized.
