Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 26th — (Reporter Fu Gang) Several leading cadres in Qubei County, Yunnan Province, have been found guilty of abusing their power for personal gain and seriously violating financial and economic discipline. They have recently been severely dealt with by the Party Committee and government of Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. County Magistrate Zhang Bingxiu has been dismissed from his post, and three people, including County Finance Bureau Director Fu Jiaming, have been arrested. Other relevant responsible parties have also been given party and administrative disciplinary actions.

The reporter learned from the National Audit Office that in August of last year, County Magistrate Zhang Bingxiu convened several meetings, instructing the county finance bureau and banks to allocate 1.79 million yuan in agricultural turnover funds and credit funds to be lent to cadre officials for planting "sanqi." According to the audit agency's investigation, 283 cadre officials borrowed a total of 1.52 million yuan, of which 14 county-level leading cadres borrowed 140,000 yuan, the county magistrate and his relatives borrowed 40,000 yuan, and the county finance bureau director and two deputy directors borrowed 70,000 yuan.

County Finance Bureau Director Fu Jiaming, in collusion with some section chiefs and staff, used various illegal means to embezzle, misappropriate, and divert public funds totaling 200,000 yuan. The accountant of the agricultural finance section of the finance bureau used forged vouchers and altered contracts to embezzle 23,000 yuan in agricultural turnover funds.

    据新华社北京11月26日电　（记者傅刚）云南省丘北县少数领导干部以权谋私，严重违反财经法纪，日前受到文山壮族苗族自治州党委和政府的严肃处理。县长张炳秀已被免职，县财政局长傅加明等三人被逮捕，其它有关责任者也分别受到党纪和政纪处分。
    记者从审计署获悉，去年8月前后，丘北县县长张炳秀多次召集会议，责成县财政局、银行拿出179万元支农周转金和信贷资金，发放给机关干部种植“三七”。据审计机关的调查，283名机关干部共借贷款152万元，其中14名县级领导干部借款14万元，县长及其亲友借款4万元，县财政局长和两名副局长借款7万元。
    县财政局长傅加明伙同部分股长和干部，采用各种非法手段，私分、侵占、挪用公款达20万元。财政局农财股会计采取伪造凭证、涂改合同等手法，贪污财政支农周转金23000元。
