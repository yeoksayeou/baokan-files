	For employees' children going to school, it concerns thousands of households, and is what employees care about the most. After understanding the actual difficulties faced by employees' children in going to school, the leaders of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Ankang Railway Division and its affiliated education department, based on local conditions, did their best to help employees solve their afterthoughts, overcome difficulties, and establish a boarding primary school. This is indeed praiseworthy.

	The Xian-Yu Railway, with 45% of its length consisting of bridges and tunnels, passes through the Han River Valley in Shaanxi Province, traverses the 6.5-kilometer Daba Mountain Tunnel, and enters Sichuan. On the 70-kilometer railway line at the border of Sichuan and Shaanxi, bridges and tunnels account for more than 90%. The terrain here is rugged, with steep slopes and sharp turns, earning it the nicknames "underground corridor" and "sky railway."

	The harsh and treacherous natural environment has brought troubles to the employees along this section of the railway managed by the Ankang Railway Division: it is really difficult for their children to go to school. The employees of the Ziyang Engineering Section's Daba Mountain Tunnel 2nd District live at the south entrance of the Daba Mountain Tunnel, and there is no school within a radius of several miles. To ensure their children can go to school, they have to get up early every day, carrying flashlights, and walk through the damp and cold tunnel to send their children to a village-run primary school two kilometers away at the north entrance of the tunnel, and then rush back to work. When school is over, they have to cross the tunnel again to pick up their children. Some children have to cross a swaying suspension bridge to go to school. Parents take turns to pick up and drop off their children every day. Year after year, it is very tiring.

	Under such circumstances, many parents are worried about their children going to school. The leaders of the Ankang Railway Division and its education office have been thinking hard about solutions. In the summer of 1986, the division decided to leverage the advantages of the railway and establish a boarding primary school based on the original Wan Yuan Railway Primary School in the southern foothills of Daba Mountain. The division allocated special funds to build a teaching building and playground for the boarding school, purchased living, cooking, and cultural and sports supplies, and solved the learning and living problems of the first batch of over 80 boarding students.

	Starting boarding from the first grade is a novel thing in the railway system. Can six or seven-year-old children live in a dormitory and eat in a cafeteria? Initially, parents were not at ease when the boarding students first arrived at school, visiting every few days. Seeing the dormitory clean and tidy, the beds neatly made, and the dining hall with rows of tables and chairs, and the daily changing menu, the parents left with peace of mind.

	The children, gathering in the dormitory for the first time, needed someone to take care of them. The school assigned several male and female teachers to stay with the children. At night, they would tuck the children in every two hours. For the younger students who couldn't dress themselves properly, the teachers helped them. For the girls who couldn't braid their hair, the teachers helped them. The teachers took care of the children as if they were their own.

	Every Saturday afternoon, the teachers would send these boarding students onto the slow train, and the parents would pick them up at the small stations along the line to spend the weekend at home. On Sunday afternoon, the parents would send them back on the train, and the teachers would receive them. Coming and going, there has never been an accident. The boarding students spend a long time at school, and the school has established various extracurricular interest groups such as painting, stamp collecting, electronic piano, ice skating, chess, root carving, dance, and sports, allowing the children to learn a lot of knowledge and skills.

	The school pays attention to cultivating the children's independence, organizing the boarding students to participate in labor within their capabilities, such as washing handkerchiefs, clothes, and pillowcases, cleaning, and helping in the kitchen. The children feel that the dumplings they make themselves are even more delicious than those made by their parents at home.

	Nowadays, parents rarely come to the school. The boarding primary school has a high reputation among the more than 20,000 employees of the Ankang Division, growing from the original one school to the current four schools.

	The boarding primary school embodies the deep affection of the division's leaders at all levels. Division Director Yang Zhan Shan always visits the boarding primary school when inspecting work in the Wan Yuan area. Once, during a rain, he found that the road in front of the school gate was muddy, and he felt uncomfortable. He immediately decided to allocate 200,000 yuan for repairs. The director of the education office and the party secretary, Yang Zhi Hua, often goes to the site to work, requiring the boarding primary school to "cultivate independence in children from a young age and make parents satisfied," helping to solve many specific problems related to the boarding students' clothing, food, housing, transportation, and learning. This year, the division invested 246,000 yuan in the boarding primary school to build a dormitory building and install heating for the entire school. This autumn, the number of boarding students increased to over 130.

	Statistics show that since its establishment, the division has invested more than 700,000 yuan in the boarding primary school.

	Now, on the 200-kilometer railway line from Dazhu Yuan Station in Shaanxi to Liang Jia Ba Station in Sichuan in the middle section of the Xian-Yu Line, 100% of the school-aged children in 16 stations along the line can enroll on time.

	The section chief of the Wan Yuan Engineering Section, who achieved a safe production record of over 1,400 days, humorously told the principal of the boarding primary school: "In the commendation certificate, there is half of our contribution, and also half of yours."

　　为职工子女上学解难
　　——安康铁路分局万源寄读小学创办记

    编者按：“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”，是我们党的优良传统。从本地、本系统、本单位的实际出发，切实地解决群众最为关心的实际问题，是领导者应尽的责任。
    职工子女上学，关系千家万户，是职工们最为关切的问题。郑州铁路局安康铁路分局及所属教育部门的领导，在了解职工子女上学的实际困难以后，因地制宜，想方设法，帮助职工解决后顾之忧，克服困难，创办寄读小学，这件事就很值得称赞。
    桥梁和隧道长度占全线45％的襄渝铁路，经过陕西境内的汉水峡谷，穿越6.5公里的大巴山隧道，进入四川。在川陕交界的70公里铁道线上，桥隧竟占90％以上。这里山大沟深，坡陡弯急，素有“地下长廊”和“空中铁道”之称。
    艰苦险峻的自然环境，给安康铁路分局管辖的这段铁路沿线的职工带来了苦恼：子女上学实在难。紫阳工务段巴山隧道2区的职工，居住在大巴山隧道南口，方圆十几里没有学校。为了让孩子上学，他们不得不每天提早起床，打着手电，穿过又湿又冷的隧道，把孩子送到隧道北口两公里以外的村办小学读书，然后再赶回来上班。放学时，又穿过隧道把孩子接回来。有的站区的孩子上学，还要经过凌空摇曳的铁索桥。朝朝暮暮，父母轮换接送。年复一年，十分辛苦。
    小孩在如此境况下上学，多少父母牵肠挂肚。安康铁路分局及其教育办的领导苦苦思索解决的办法。1986年夏天，分局决定发挥铁路自身优势，在大巴山南麓原万源铁小的基础上创办一所寄读小学。分局拨出专款，给寄读小学修建了教学楼和操场，购置了住宿、炊事用具和文体用品，解决了首批80多名寄读生的学习和生活问题。
    从小学一年级就开始寄读，这在铁路系统还是一件新鲜事。六七岁的孩子，住集体宿舍，吃大食堂，行吗？寄读生初到学校，家长们很不放心，三天两头跑去探望。一看，宿舍窗明几净，小床上被褥齐整，餐厅里桌椅成行，饭菜花样日日翻新，家长们放心地走了。
    孩子们初次相聚在集体宿舍，需要有人照料。学校分别派了几名男老师和女老师，陪孩子们睡觉。夜里，还每两小时为孩子掖一次被子。低年级学生衣服穿不好，老师帮他们穿。小辫梳不好，老师帮她们梳。老师们像待自己孩子一样关照着他们。
    每到星期六下午，老师便送这些寄读生登上慢车，家长在沿线小站接他们回家度周末。星期天下午父母送上车，再由老师接回来。来来往往，从未发生意外。寄读生在校时间长，学校成立了绘画、集邮、电子琴、溜冰、棋类、根雕以及舞蹈、体育等多种课外兴趣小组，使孩子们学到许多知识和技能。
    学校重视培养孩子们的自立能力，组织寄读生参加力所能及的劳动，如洗手绢、衣服、枕巾，打扫卫生，到食堂帮灶等。孩子们吃着自己动手包的饺子，感到比家里父母做的还香。
    如今，家长们平时很少来学校了。寄读小学在安康分局两万多名职工中，享有很高的声誉，已由最早的这1所发展到现在的4所。
    寄读小学凝聚着分局各级领导的深情。分局长杨占山每次到万源地区检查工作，总要到寄读小学看看。一次正逢下雨，他发现校门口的那段路泥泞不堪，心里很不是滋味，当即决定拨款两万多元加以整修。分局教育办主任、党委书记杨志华经常深入现场办公，要求寄读小学对学生“从小培养自立精神，让家长放心满意”，帮助解决寄读生衣、食、住、行、学等许多具体问题。今年，分局又给这所寄读小学投资24.6万元，修建了一幢住宿楼，给全校安装了暖气。今年秋季开学，住宿生扩大到130多名。
    据统计，自开办以来，分局已先后为这所寄读小学投资70多万元。
    现在，襄渝线中段自陕西大竹园站至四川梁家坝站，200多公里铁路沿线、16个站区的学龄儿童100％能按时入学。
    实现安全生产突破1400天的万源工务段段长，饶有风趣地对寄读小学校长说：“立功奖状里，有我们的一半，也有你们的一半。”
