Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation has strengthened its scientific and technological development, completing 409 projects over three years, yielding an annual economic benefit of 190 million yuan.

Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation has adhered to the principle of leading production with science and technology, sparing no effort to motivate scientific and technological personnel to engage in scientific research and technological development, thereby promoting the development of production and operations. The double-ball sintering process, completed through the efforts of scientific and technological personnel, has achieved a major breakthrough in China's fine ore production self-melting sintering process, reaching an advanced world level. It has played an important role in solving issues related to the production, quality, and energy consumption of fine hematite ore sintering. Another achievement that has entered the world's advanced ranks—the high-furnace high-oxygen large-scale blowing industrial trial research—has won the National Science and Technology Progress First Prize.
