Our reporter Yu Qing reports from Tokyo: After a two-day break, the Sixth Men's Volleyball World Cup resumed today at the Sun Dome in Hiroshima. The most anticipated match between Cuba and the Soviet Union saw Cuba defeat the Soviet Union 3-1, overcoming their last major rival and laying a solid foundation for their first-ever gold medal in a major tournament. The results of the other three matches were: Italy defeated South Korea 3-0, Brazil defeated Cameroon 3-0, and the United States defeated Japan 3-1.

The match between Cuba and the Soviet Union showcased Cuba's impressive strength. In the first set, the Soviet Union took an early lead at 9-2. Cuba then caught up to 12-12 and scored three consecutive points to win the set. In the second set, Cuba won comfortably with a score of 15-8. In the third set, Cuba made several receiving errors, allowing the Soviet Union to maintain a lead and win the set 15-10. In the fourth set, Cuba started strong with a 6-0 lead. The Soviet Union then scored four consecutive points. After that, it was all Cuba, scoring nine consecutive points to secure the final victory. With number 4 Despaigne as the center, Cuba's high-speed combination attacks were fierce, and they also demonstrated excellent defensive capabilities. With undeniable strength, Cuba took a big step towards winning both the men's and women's championships.

So far, halfway through the tournament, Cuba has won all four of their matches and is on track to win the championship. The remaining matches will mainly see other strong teams competing for the silver and bronze medals. Italy is in a good position to win the silver medal.
