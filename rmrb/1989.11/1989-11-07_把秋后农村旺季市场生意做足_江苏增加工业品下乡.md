	"Clothing is not a worry, food is not a worry, two eyes are fixed on the department store." Facing this vast rural market, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Commerce requires state-owned commerce to increase the supply of industrial goods to rural areas, improve the supply of goods in the post-autumn rural peak season, and make the most of the rural market business.

	Since the second quarter of this year, the market has shown signs of sluggishness, and product inventories have increased, becoming a prominent issue in current economic development.

	The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Commerce has analyzed the current situation of sluggish commodity sales and believes that, first, cities have been in a state of overheated consumption for a long time, resulting in a significant drop in the growth rate of the city's total retail sales this year. The growth rate of the city's total retail sales from January to September has dropped by 30 percentage points, while the total retail sales in counties and below have only dropped by 7 percentage points. Second, this year's autumn harvest in Jiangsu is relatively good, and various sideline productions such as pigs and silkworm cocoons have seen significant development. Farmers' incomes will increase, coupled with substantial savings and cash on hand, making the rural peak season this year better than in cities.

	The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Commerce has put forward requirements for increasing industrial goods to rural areas: genuinely change the work style, shift the focus to the vast rural market, strengthen and improve the team for sending industrial goods to rural areas; establish inspection and assessment systems; in response to the current severe shortage of funds in grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, state-owned commerce can adopt flexible settlement methods for different commodities, such as on-the-spot settlement, deferred payment, installment payment, and post-sale repayment, and help grassroots units adjust accumulated goods and activate funds; strengthen services, change from fixed shops to mobile sales, conduct mobile sales, deliver goods to rural areas, lower the wholesale starting point, provide retail services, and carry out one-stop services for ticketing, settlement, pickup, and loading; under the premise of relying on supply and marketing cooperatives, encourage collective and individual commerce to send industrial goods to rural areas through multiple channels.

### 把秋后农村旺季市场生意做足  江苏增加工业品下乡

    把秋后农村旺季市场生意做足
    江苏增加工业品下乡
    本报南京11月6日电  记者龚永泉报道：“穿不愁，吃不愁，两眼盯着百货楼”。面对农村这个大市场，江苏省商业厅要求国营商业增加工业品下乡，搞好秋后农村旺季市场供应，把农村市场的生意做足。
    今年二季度以来，市场出现疲软，产品库存增加，已成为当前经济发展中的突出问题。
    江苏省商业部门对当前商品销售疲软的情况进行了分析，认为首先是由于城市长期处于过热消费状态中，致使今年城市零售总额的增长幅度有很大回落，1至9月份城市零售总额的增幅回落30个百分点，而县和县以下的零售总额回落只有7个百分点；第二，今年江苏秋熟作物形势较好，生猪、蚕茧等多种经营有较大发展，农民收入将有所增加，加上可观的储蓄和手存现金，农村今年的旺季将好于城市。
    江苏省商业厅对增加工业品下乡提出要求：切实转变思想作风，把立足点转移到农村广阔市场，充实和健全工业品下乡队伍；建立检查、考核制度；针对基层供销社目前资金严重紧缺的状况，国营商业可根据不同商品采取灵活的结算方法，如当场结算、约期付款、分期付款、销后还款等，并帮助基层调剂积压商品，搞活资金；强化服务，改坐商为行商，巡回销售，送货下乡，降低批发起点，拆零供应，开展开票、结算、提货、装车一条龙服务；在依靠供销社的前提下，鼓励集体、个体商业多渠道把工业品送下乡。
