    Argentine Senate Acting President, Justice Party delegation head Eduardo Menem, who has just returned from a visit to China, told reporters at the airport that his visit was successful and would help strengthen friendly relations between Argentina and China.

    He said, "We had the opportunity to observe China's actual situation up close. We did not see any tense atmosphere. The people are working calmly and are dedicated to national construction. My impression is that the events that occurred in May and June this year have now dissipated."

    Menem said that the delegation met with China's top leaders in Beijing, and the visit achieved positive results. He said that he had extensive discussions with Chinese leaders on further strengthening Argentina-China relations, and that bilateral relations could further develop, with bilateral trade likely to increase.

    He said, "Yang Shangkun, the Chairman, left the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to receive the delegation. I was the first foreigner to learn of the important decisions made at this plenary session. China's leaders are very shrewd and capable, familiar with their work, and also very knowledgeable about the international situation."

    The Argentine Justice Party delegation was invited to visit China by the Communist Party of China.
