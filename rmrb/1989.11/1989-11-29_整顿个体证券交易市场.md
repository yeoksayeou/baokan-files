Monitoring Post

Currently, the individual securities trading markets in some regions are quite chaotic. Along the streets, near school gates, one can see small signs saying “Buying Lottery Tickets, Treasury Bonds.” The buyers do not have fixed locations, and the prices they offer vary greatly. Most of them have no formal procedures; some are local idle individuals; some are engaged in a “second job”; and others are roaming individuals from outside the region.

Since this year, our bureau has cracked multiple cases of stolen securities, with amounts ranging from a few dozen yuan to several thousand yuan. The criminals are mostly students under the age of 15. After stealing lottery tickets and treasury bonds, they take them to individual securities buying points to exchange for money. Some buyers, knowing that these securities are from illegal sources, not only do not report this to the relevant departments but also take the opportunity to buy them at a lower price.

It is suggested that the relevant departments rectify the individual securities trading market.

### 整顿个体证券交易市场

　　整顿个体证券交易市场
    当前，一些地区的个体有价证券交易市场比较混乱。马路旁，校门口，到处可见“收购奖券、国库券”的小牌子。收购者没有固定的地点，收购价差异也较大。他们中多数无任何手续，有的是本地无业闲散人员；有的是在干“第二职业”；有的则是外地流窜人员。
    今年以来，我局破获多起盗窃有价证券案件，数额少则几十元，多则几千元。犯罪分子大都是15岁以下的学生，他们偷到奖券、国库券后拿到个体有价证券收购点去兑换。有的收购者明知这些证券来路不正，不但不向有关部门反映，反而借机压价收购。
    建议有关部门对个体有价证券交易市场进行整顿。
