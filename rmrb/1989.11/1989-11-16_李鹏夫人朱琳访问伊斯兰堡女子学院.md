The late autumn in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, is still bright and sunny, with lush greenery everywhere. The campus of the Islamabad Model College for Women was particularly beautiful today. At 10:40 AM, Madame Li Peng arrived at the college with Mrs. Shahnaaz and Mrs. Lin Yan-yi, wife of the Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, Ding Ding. She was greeted by a guard of honor composed of female students in Boy Scout uniforms and female students dressed in colorful national costumes. Amidst the students' shouts of "Long live Sino-Pakistan friendship!" and "Welcome, welcome!" in Chinese, and the sound of drums, Madame Li Peng accepted a bouquet of flowers presented by two kindergarten children from the school. She then shook hands with the principal and teachers who were waiting to welcome her.

Madame Li Peng visited the kindergarten and primary school sections of the college and presented gifts to the children. When Madame Li Peng turned on an electric panda toy and placed it on the table, the children saw the panda's cute movements and burst into laughter.

The Minister of State for Education of Pakistan and the college principal delivered welcome speeches in the library hall. In her reply, Madame Li Peng praised the good environment and educational order of the college and wished the teachers to cultivate more talents.

When Madame Li Peng concluded her visit, hundreds of female students lined up to see her off, rhythmically shouting "Goodbye, goodbye" in Chinese. Madame Li Peng also said "Khuda Hafiz" (goodbye) in Urdu to the students.
