Title: The Fundamental Issue Lies in the Stance

The Czech Prime Minister, Adamec, who visited Austria, said at a press conference: "Those who want to abolish the Communist Party and socialism should not discuss democracy." This resolute language, I believe, will confuse young Western journalists, while older gentlemen will feel a sense of familiarity. When this reaches the land of China, it will probably shock some people!

In fact, Adamec's words are not particularly unusual; they merely reflect the fundamental stance of a Communist. Those who want to abolish the Communist Party and socialism have their own stance. Unless you agree to cooperate with them in a "peaceful evolution," there is no possibility of having any common language. We have seen more of this than the Czechoslovakian comrades. For a while, people here used "democracy" as an excuse to engage in political conspiracies and were quite active. Didn't Mr. Fang Lizhi want to kick over the pot and say, "Dissolve China"? He always talks about "democracy," and how many well-meaning people have discussed with him, including those who gently advised him to change his "extreme views." What was the result? He mistakenly saw you as a stubborn, conservative force and saw the powerful socialist China as nothing more than the "Bastille" of old, with only a few weak and elderly soldiers guarding it, aiming to realize their dreams in China on the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.

The democracy we talk about, as pointed out in the *Communist Manifesto*, is the rights of the people "won" after the proletariat becomes the ruling class. This struggle has lasted for more than a century, sacrificing countless revolutionary martyrs. What we have obtained is the democracy of the proletariat, the democracy of the masses, not the democracy of a few, nor the democracy of the bourgeoisie. In our country, anyone can discuss democracy—wise and thoughtful scholars, young students who have not yet experienced much of the world, selfless Communist Party members, and the broad masses of the people. As long as they do not want to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system, they can discuss it. Even if they have a little wisdom, the Party and the government will pick it up. However, if they want to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system, they are not discussing "the people ruling the country," but "the people being slaves," which is absolutely not allowed. Mao Zedong once said that democracy is for the people, and for the enemy, only dictatorship can be discussed. What democracy can be discussed with them?

The words of Adamec are quite familiar to Chinese Communist Party members. Especially at the beginning of the founding of New China, facing the domestic and foreign hostile forces' saber-rattling, the Chinese Communist Party members at that time saw the class enemies' "discussing democracy" and "discussing freedom" with smiling faces. They ruthlessly tore off their tender and affectionate masks, exposing their hypocrisy and reactionary nature. In recent years, influenced by the "international climate" and the Party's weak counterattack against bourgeois liberalization, the trend of liberalization has become rampant. Some "elites" even raised the banner of building a bourgeois republic, while kind-hearted Communist Party members were still calmly discussing "democracy" with them, still talking to them about "relaxation," until the chaos and counter-revolutionary rebellion were brewed. This lesson is worth learning.

Adamec's words are the common belief of all true Communists. One of the main tasks of Communists is to dig the grave for the bourgeoisie. It is in the struggle against the bourgeoisie that it grows and strengthens, and its existence is to steadfastly complete this task.

　　根本在于立场
　　楠客
    到奥地利访问的捷克斯洛伐克总理阿达麦茨，在一次记者招待会上说：不同要取消共产党和社会主义的人讨论民主。这种斩钉截铁的语言，我相信会使年轻的西方记者感到困惑，而老先生们却会产生久违之感。传到华夏大地，大抵也会使某些人为之一震吧！
    其实，阿达麦茨的语言并不特别，不过体现了一个共产党人的根本立场。想取消共产党和社会主义的人自有他们的立场，除非你答应和他们合作搞“和平演变”，否则是不可能有什么共同语言的。这种事，我们比捷克斯洛伐克的同志还要见得多。有一阵，我们这里以“民主”为借口大搞政治阴谋的人也十分活跃，方励之先生不是就要一脚把锅踢翻，说干脆“解散中国”吗？他是言必称“民主”的，不知多少好心人和他探讨过，其中不乏苦劝他改变“偏激观点”的温柔敦厚之士，结果怎么样？倒使他错把你看成食古不化的顽固、保守势力，错把强大的社会主义中国看得不过像当年只有几十个老弱残兵守卫的“巴士底狱”，要在法国大革命200周年之际，在中国实现他们的美梦。
    我们所谈的民主，正如《共产党宣言》所指出的，是“无产阶级上升为统治阶级”之后“争得”的人民的权利。这一争，争了一个多世纪，牺牲了无数革命先烈。我们所得到的是无产阶级的民主，人民大众的民主，而不是少数人的民主，资产阶级的民主。在我们国家，民主问题当然谁都可以谈，深思熟虑的贤达，涉世未深的学子，大公无私的共产党员以及广大的人民群众。只要不想取消共产党的领导和社会主义制度，都可以谈。稍有一点珠玑，党和政府也会撷拾。然而，想取消共产党的领导和社会主义制度，谈的不是“人民当家做主”，而是“人民当牛做马”，那绝对不行。毛泽东同志早就说过，民主是对人民而言的，对敌人只能谈专政。和他们“谈民主”，谈什么呢？
    阿达麦茨的话，中国共产党员应该是相当熟悉的。特别是新中国诞生之初，面对国内外敌对势力的剑拔弩张，当时中国共产党人看到阶级敌人“谈民主”“谈自由”的嘻皮笑脸，曾毫不留情地撕下他们那温情脉脉的面纱，指出他们的虚伪性和反动性。这几年，受“国际大气候”的影响和我们党对资产阶级自由化反击不力，弄得自由化思潮泛滥成灾。某些“精英”甚至打出了要建资产阶级共和国的旗帜，而善良的共产党员还在心平气和地和他们谈什么“民主”，还对他们讲什么“宽松”，直至酿成动乱和反革命暴乱之灾。这个教训是值得记取的。
      阿达麦茨的话，是一切真正共产党人的共同信念。共产党人的主要任务之一就是为资产阶级掘墓。她是在和资产阶级的斗争中生长、壮大的，她的存在就是要始终不渝地完成这个任务。
