	The People's Daily reports that in Guolou Village, Xinxing Township, Heze City, Shandong Province, farmer Zhao Haijun, influenced by the rumor that "contracts will change and trees will be taken back by the state," planned to cut down over 100 thriving paulownia trees. Upon hearing the news, Zhang Renjie, the director of the Heze Regional Forestry Bureau, rushed to the scene and said, "The Party's rural contract policy has not changed. These paulownia trees, if allowed to grow for another two or three years, will surely bring you an income of 200,000 yuan." These words immediately dispelled Zhao Haijun and other farmers' intentions to cut down the trees, thus saving a large area of paulownia forest.

	Heze Region's total production of paulownia trees accounts for one-third of the province's output, and the region leads the province in paulownia wood exports. After the autumn planting season, counties and cities such as Heze, Yuncheng, and Dingtao in this region successively saw a wave of indiscriminate paulownia tree cutting, which quickly spread throughout the area. In some villages, entire paulownia forests were cut down. The root cause of this problem is that some farmers, influenced by rumors, have doubts about various rural contract policies and mistakenly believe that "responsibility fields will no longer be farmed, and the trees that are growing will also be taken back by the state."

	As soon as the trend of tree cutting and forest destruction began, the Heze Regional Party Committee and the Regional Government promptly issued an emergency notice to the entire region to immediately halt the destruction of forests. They also launched a widespread campaign to educate the public about the Party's policies. All 297 townships in the region thoroughly reorganized and strengthened their forest protection organizations, further tightening the forestry management responsibility system. Various levels of forestry departments in the region also strengthened forestry administration, strictly managing the approval, inspection, and administration of logging permits, transportation permits, and business operation permits, effectively blocking loopholes for illegal timber trading.

　　宣传农村政策　消除农民疑虑
　　菏泽刹住砍树毁林风
    本报讯　山东省菏泽市新兴乡郭楼村农民赵海军，因听信“承包要变，树要归公”的谣言，准备把100多棵生长旺盛的桐树砍光。闻讯赶来的菏泽地区林业局局长张仁杰劝他说：“党在农村的承包政策没有变，这片好桐树再长两三年，保你收入两万元。”一席话，顿时打消了赵海军和其他农民砍树的念头，大片的桐树林保住了。
    菏泽地区的桐树总产量占全省的1／3，桐木出口量居全省首位。进入秋种以后，这个地区的菏泽、郓城、定陶等县市相继刮起一股乱砍桐树风，很快在全区蔓延开来，个别村庄的桐林被一砍而光。究其原因，是少数农民听信谣言，对农村各项承包政策产生疑虑，错误地认为“责任田种不长了，长着的树也要归公。”
    砍树毁林风刚一刮起，菏泽地委、行署及时向全区发出立即刹住毁林风的紧急通知，并在全区普遍开展党的政策宣传教育活动。全区297个乡镇普遍整顿和充实护林组织，进一步严格了林业管理责任制。全区各级林业部门还加强林政管理，严格采伐许可证、运输许可证和经营许可证的审批、检查和管理，有效地堵住了木材贩子违法经营的漏洞。
