The Agricultural Ministry Wheat Expert Consultative Group has reminded local authorities to urgently focus on winter wheat management and effectively overcome the adverse factors of insufficient moisture and delayed sowing.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Yantai, November 24 (Reporter Pu Liyue), the critical stage of winter wheat management before winter is crucial for securing a bumper summer harvest next year. Time is running out, and the Agricultural Ministry Wheat Expert Consultative Group urges all localities: Do not be complacent or relax efforts. Fully recognize the adverse factors of insufficient soil moisture and delayed sowing, and promptly and effectively manage the wheat fields to ensure the wheat survives the winter safely.

Members of the Agricultural Ministry Wheat Expert Consultative Group recently gathered in Yantai to analyze and study the wheat sowing situation this year. They believe that the sowing foundation this year is better than in previous years, with most wheat-sowing areas having full, robust, and healthy seedlings. Currently, the wheat seedlings are growing well.

The experts also pointed out that there are many concerning issues in wheat production at present: First, although the surface soil moisture is good, the deep soil moisture is insufficient. Second, there is a large area of late-sown wheat. This year, the late-sown wheat area in six provinces and municipalities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Sichuan, reached more than 67 million mu, an increase of 15 million mu compared to last year, which will inevitably increase the difficulty of mid-to-late field management. Third, some local leaders, due to this year's grain harvest and good sowing foundation, have become complacent and relaxed, paying insufficient attention to winter wheat management before winter.

The experts analyzed that this year is a year with a colder winter, making winter wheat management before winter even more important. The experts hope that while local authorities focus on various agricultural tasks, they will prioritize wheat field management, effectively manage it, and lay a solid foundation for a bumper harvest next year.

　　农业部小麦专家顾问组提醒各地
　　抓紧抓好小麦冬前管理
　　切实克服底墒不足、播期推迟的不利因素
    据新华社烟台11月24日电  （记者蒲立业）对夺取明年夏粮丰收至关重要的小麦冬前管理阶段，余下的时间已不多了，农业部小麦专家顾问组值此提醒各地：绝不可有半点麻痹松劲情绪，要充分看到麦播底墒不足、播期推迟的不利因素，尽快抓紧抓好麦田管理工作，以确保小麦安全越冬。
    农业部小麦专家顾问组成员近日汇集烟台，分析研究了今年我国的麦播形势。他们认为，今年各地播种基础好于往年，大部分麦播区苗全、苗足、苗壮，目前麦苗长势良好。
    专家们同时指出，目前小麦生产也存在着许多令人担忧的问题：一是表墒虽好，但底墒不足。二是晚播面积大，今年，京、津、冀、鲁、豫、川六省市小麦晚播面积达6700多万亩，比去年增加1500万亩，这势必加大中后期田间管理难度；三是有些地方领导因今年粮食丰收、麦播基础好，思想上产生了麻痹、松劲情绪，对小麦冬前管理重视不够。
    专家们分析认为，今年属冬季偏寒年份，冬前麦田管理就显得愈发重要。专家们希望各地在抓好各项农事工作的同时，要把麦田管理放到首要位置上来，切切实实抓紧抓好，为夺取明年丰收打下牢固基础。
