More than 80,000 residents from the earthquake-stricken areas of Datong, Yanggao, Hunsuan, and Guangling counties in Shanxi Province's Yanshan region have moved into temporary shelters.

The earthquake that struck the Yanshan region during the transition from autumn to winter caused the collapse of 33,000 homes in 69 villages, leaving more than 70,000 homes severely damaged.

With the support and donations from all over the country, the local government mobilized the people to build 28,000 temporary shelters before the winter solstice. These shelters are designed to be earthquake-resistant, able to withstand cold, snow, and rain, and provide adequate lighting. On average, each severely affected household has one shelter. The residents are very happy to move into their new, warm homes. Some have even written couplets to express their gratitude, praising the Communist Party for its practical efforts on behalf of the disaster victims.

    雁北震区八万灾民迁入暖棚
    新华社太原11月14日电  山西省雁北地区的大同、阳高、浑源、广灵等县地震区的8万多名灾民，目前已陆续迁入简易房。
    雁北地区在秋冬之交发生的地震中，使69个村庄的3.3万间房屋倒塌，造成危房7万多间。
    在全国各地的热情捐助下，当地政府发动群众在立冬之前共建起可防震、能避寒、能避雪雨、能采光的大小暖棚2.8万间，平均每个重灾户就有一间。灾民们住进暖烘烘的新居室时，十分高兴。有的自编对联贴在门上，称赞共产党为灾民办了实事。
