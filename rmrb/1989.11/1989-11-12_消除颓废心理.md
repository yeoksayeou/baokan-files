	Eliminating the Psychology of Decadence

	Currently, as we oppose bourgeois liberalization and revive the revolutionary spirit, the psychology of decadence should be eliminated.

	The manifestations of decadent psychology are as follows:

	Extinguishing of faith. Decadent psychology in terms of faith is entering a "blind alley": not believing in Marxism-Leninism but in ghosts and gods, not believing in communism but in capitalism.

	Political apathy. Being indifferent and detached from political issues. Only caring about personal matters, not about national affairs.

	Short-sighted vision. Only focusing on the present, not the future. Only seeing crises, not opportunities.

	Slacking off at work. Perhaps due to setbacks leading to disappointment, or success leading to complacency, learning and working just to get by. Avoiding trouble, not causing trouble, and not doing much work.

	Loose discipline. Not obeying orders, obeying with conditions. Ignoring social ethics and revolutionary discipline.

	The roots of decadent psychology are as follows: First, subjective consciousness cannot correctly reflect objective reality, leading to generalization from one instance, and overlooking many others. Thus, the historical traditions of the Chinese nation are belittled, the image of the Communist Party is distorted, difficulties and mistakes in the process of advancement are exaggerated, and revolutionary spirit is desecrated. Second, the influence of rampant bourgeois liberalization. Third, the result of the malignant expansion of individualism. In a period of time, bourgeois individualism has been strengthened: the advocacy of "self-value, self-development, self-realization," and other "egoistic" ideologies has greatly stirred up people's personal desires and eroded the spirit of dedication and sacrifice. Once self-value is denied and self-development is thwarted, people become despairing and spiritually decadent.

	Today, in our socialist country, decadent psychology is indeed contrary to the enterprising spirit of the Chinese nation and is extremely incompatible with the prosperous and flourishing socialist scene. Fundamentally, as long as one's personal future and development are integrated into the future and development of the motherland, and as long as the correct outlook on life and values are truly established, decadent psychology will have no place to stand.

### 消除颓废心理

    消除颓废心理
    当前，我们反对资产阶级自由化，振奋革命精神，颓废心理当属消除之列。
    颓废心理的表现有下列种种：
    信仰的泯灭。颓废心理表现在信仰上是走入“误区”：不信马列信鬼神，不信共产主义而信资本主义。
    政治的麻木。对政治问题冷漠超然。只问自己事，不想国家事。
    眼光的短视。只顾眼前，不看长远。只见危机，不见生机。
    工作上的混。也许因遭受挫折而失望，抑或由功成名就而满足，学习工作，得过且过。不找事，不惹事，也不干事。
    纪律上的松。命令不服从，服从有条件。不顾社会公德，不要革命纪律。
    产生颓废心理的根源，一是主观意识不能正确地反映客观事物，以偏概全，挂一漏万。于是乎，中华民族的历史传统被贬低了，共产党的形象被扭曲了，前进中的困难和失误被夸大了，革命的精神被亵渎了。二是资产阶级自由化泛滥的影响。三是个人主义恶性膨胀的结果。一个时期以来，资产阶级个人主义被强化了：“自我价值，自我发展，自我实现”等“唯我”主义的鼓噪，极大地撩拨起人们的个人欲望，消弭了奉献、牺牲之心。一旦自我价值被否定，自我发展受挫折，便万念俱灰，精神颓废。
    今天，在我们社会主义的国度里，颓废心理实在有悖于中华民族的进取精神，与繁荣兴旺的社会主义景象极不适应。从根本上说，只要把个人的前途和发展融入到祖国的前途和发展之中去，只要正确的人生观、价值观真正树立起来，颓废心理则无立足之地。
