	Beijing Anti-Doping Testing Center Achieves Good Results in Qualification Exam, Awaiting Recognition from the IOC Medical Commission

	The Beijing Anti-Doping Testing Center recently underwent a qualification exam conducted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Medical Commission. The center accurately identified all 10 urine samples, marking a crucial step in its journey to obtain IOC certification.

	The IOC Medical Commission will make the final decision on the test results and report. If all goes well, the Beijing Anti-Doping Testing Center is expected to receive formal recognition from the IOC Medical Commission by the end of this year.

	This afternoon, Klaus Neiser, a specialist from East Germany, who was appointed by the IOC Medical Commission to oversee this qualification exam, brought a large cake from his home country to celebrate the success of his Chinese colleagues.

	Klaus Neiser is the director of the East German Anti-Doping Testing Laboratory, the first laboratory in the world to be recognized by the IOC Medical Commission. Currently, there are 19 laboratories recognized by the IOC worldwide, with only two in Asia—Tokyo and Seoul.

	Klaus Neiser praised the Chinese colleagues for achieving the capability to complete this qualification exam in just three years. He said, "The proactive spirit and diligent work ethic of the staff at the Beijing Anti-Doping Testing Center have left a deep impression on me."

	He believes that the Beijing Anti-Doping Testing Center will be able to independently handle the anti-doping testing tasks for the upcoming Asian Games.

    北京兴奋剂检测中心合格考试获好成绩
    可望取得奥委会医学委员会正式承认
    新华社北京11月11日电　（记者许基仁、周杰）北京兴奋剂检测中心近日在接受国际奥委会医学委员会的合格考试中，正确无误地测定了全部10瓶尿样，这意味着该中心在取得奥委会合格证的艰难历程中迈出了最关键的一步。
    国际奥委会医学委员会将对这次考试的测试结果和报告作最后审定。如一切顺利，北京兴奋剂检测中心可望在今年底取得奥委会医学委员会的正式承认。
    今天下午，受国际奥委会医学委员会的委派来华主持这次合格考试的民主德国专家克劳斯尼泽尔博士拿出了他特意从国内带来的一个大蛋糕，祝贺中国同行的成功。
    克劳斯尼泽尔博士是民主德国兴奋剂检测实验室主任，该室是世界上第一个获国际奥委会医学委员会承认的实验室。目前世界上被奥委会承认的实验室有19家，亚洲仅有东京和汉城两家。
    克劳斯尼泽尔博士对中国同行在3年的时间内就具备了圆满完成这次合格考试的实力表示赞许，并说：“北京兴奋剂检测中心工作人员的进取精神和勤奋作风给我留下深刻印象”。
    他认为：北京兴奋剂检测中心能够独立承担明年亚运会的兴奋剂检测任务。
