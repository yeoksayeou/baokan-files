The Henan Photographic Novelists' Association was recently established in Zhengzhou.

The photographic novel is a popular comprehensive art form around the world today. It draws on the strengths of photography, literature, directing, and performance, standing out on its own and being loved by many readers. The establishment of the Henan Photographic Novelists' Association will help to promote the creation of photographic novels in Henan and across the country, and facilitate international cultural exchange.

The association will publish the "Masses Photographic Novel Newspaper" and the "Henan Photographic Novelists" magazine. It will also hold the second national photographic novel awards competition by the end of this year.
