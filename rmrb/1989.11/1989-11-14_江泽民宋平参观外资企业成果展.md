    Jiang Zemin and Song Ping, members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, visited the China International Trade Center Exhibition Hall this evening to view the China Foreign-Invested Enterprises Achievements Exhibition.

    Jiang Zemin carefully inspected the entire exhibition and was warmly welcomed by the staff of the "three types of enterprises" (foreign-funded, jointly-funded, and cooperatively-funded) and the foreign representatives. Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, Shen Jueren, pointed to a map of the People's Republic of China in the Comprehensive Hall and explained to Jiang Zemin that Tibet also has a jointly-funded enterprise, indicating that joint ventures have been established in all parts of the country. Jiang Zemin nodded in satisfaction. In the Ningbo Hall, Jiang Zemin saw a piano produced by a joint venture and walked over to play "The Yellow River Cantata" from "The Yellow River."

    Jiang Zemin showed particular interest in energy, communications, electronics, automobiles, and high-tech joint ventures, inquiring about the operational status of these enterprises. When he learned that the float glass produced by Shanghai Yohua Pilkington Company had 60% of its output exported, he was very pleased. At the booth of Shanghai Roche Pharmaceuticals Limited, he recalled his previous visit to the company's foreign general manager to discuss how to do a good job in the political and ideological work of the employees.

    Jiang Zemin also paid close attention to the utilization of foreign capital in the old, minority, remote, and poor regions such as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Hainan. In the Inner Mongolia Hall, he inquired with concern whether a wool mill in Hohhot had started operations.

    Other leaders who visited the exhibition this evening included Wang Ping, Chen Xilian, Apuo Awang Jinmei, Yan Jizi, Liao Hansheng, Lei Jianqun, Wang Hanbin, Zhou Peiyuan, and Hou Jinru.

    江泽民宋平参观外资企业成果展
    本报北京11月13日讯　新华社记者张毅、本报记者刘霄报道：中共中央总书记江泽民、中共中央政治局常委宋平等领导同志，今晚到中国国际贸易中心展览大厅参观了中国外商投资企业成果展览会。
    江泽民仔细观看了整个展览，受到参展的“三资”企业工作人员和外方人员的热烈欢迎。经贸部副部长沈觉人在综合馆指着一张中华人民共和国地图，向江泽民介绍西藏也有了一家合资企业，说明全国各地都有了合资企业，江泽民听后高兴得直点头。在宁波馆，江泽民看到一家合资企业生产的钢琴，就走上前去弹奏了《黄河大合唱》中的《黄水谣》。
    江泽民对能源、通讯、电子、汽车及高技术的合资项目特别感兴趣，询问了这类企业的经营情况。当他听说上海耀华皮尔金顿公司生产的浮法玻璃已有60％出口时，非常高兴。在上海施贵宝制药有限公司的展台前，他回顾了他以前去给这家公司的外方总经理做工作，如何做好职工政治思想工作的情况。
    江泽民对新疆、内蒙古、海南等老少边穷地区的利用外资情况也很关注。在内蒙古馆他关切地问呼和浩特一家毛纺厂开工了没有。
    今晚参观展览的还有王平、陈锡联、阿沛·阿旺晋美、严济慈、廖汉生、雷洁琼、王汉斌、周培源、侯镜如等领导同志。
