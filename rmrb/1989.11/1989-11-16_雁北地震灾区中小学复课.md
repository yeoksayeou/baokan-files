Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily reporters Chi Maohua and Yan Xiaoming report from Datong: The sound of children reciting their lessons can be heard from the tents in the Yanan earthquake zone. After the earthquakes in Datong and Yanggao, various levels of government quickly took measures to reopen schools. Currently, more than 20,000 primary and secondary school students have all moved into heated tents for classes.

On October 18, an earthquake struck the Yanan region of Shanxi Province, affecting Datong, Yanggao, Hunyuan, and Guangling. A total of 21 townships and 131 schools were damaged, 2,350 classrooms collapsed, and 2,994 classrooms were severely damaged, leaving nearly 20,000 primary and secondary school students without a place to study.

Immediately after the earthquake, leaders from the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, government, and education departments rushed to the disaster area. They mobilized the masses to resist the earthquake and provide relief. Teachers and students overcame difficulties and used makeshift methods such as double-shift classes and large-class teaching to resume classes. To quickly move the children into heated tents for study, the Yanan Administrative Office and the Provincial Education Commission allocated 590,000 yuan specifically for disaster-area schools.

    雁北地震灾区中小学复课
    本报大同11月15日电　新华社记者池茂花、本报记者阎晓明报道：一阵阵琅琅读书声，不时从雁北地震灾区的帐篷飞出。大同、阳高地震后，各级政府迅速采取措施使学校复课。目前2万多名中小学生已全部搬进保暖帐篷上课。
    10月18日山西雁北地区的大同、阳高、浑源、广灵地震后，有21个乡镇131所学校被震毁，2350间教室倒塌，严重危房达2994间，近2万名中小学生无处上课。
    地震刚一发生，山西省、地县各级党委、政府及教育部门的领导同志立即赶赴灾区，深入动员群众抗震救灾。广大师生员工因陋就简、克服困难，开设二部制、大课式等办法使学校复课。为了早日让孩子们搬进暖棚内读书，雁北行署、省教委共拨出59万元专款，全部用于灾区学校。
