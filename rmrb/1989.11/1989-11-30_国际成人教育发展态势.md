Adult education is an important component of contemporary society's overall education system. Today, the scale, diversity, richness of content, and flexibility of teaching methods in international adult education are unprecedented. Through the following main aspects, we can understand the development trends in international adult education.

Legalization of Adult Education

The development of adult education urgently requires supervision and management, and its institutionalization and legalization.

Before the Second World War, few countries had legislation on adult education. After the war, especially since the 1960s, many countries began to work on adult education legislation. Since the 1960s, Japan has successively passed several bills related to adult education. In particular, the "Adult Education Act" promulgated by the Japanese government in 1980 made specific provisions for the status, research work, and teacher training of adult education. In 1975, the Federal Republic of Germany formally enacted the "Adult Education Vocational Law," dividing the training of in-service personnel into two types: new technology or professional training and post-secondary continuing education, and making detailed regulations for each. The establishment and implementation of adult education regulations have provided legal guarantees for adult education, thereby promoting its development.

Lifelong Adult Education

Accompanying the popularity of lifelong education theory in the 1960s, another notable feature of international adult education is its integration into the lifelong education system.

The rapid development of modern society requires people to receive education throughout their lives. With the improvement of the popularization level of adult education and the extension of its duration, ensuring the lifelong nature of adult education has attracted the attention of various countries. The Soviet Union is particularly prominent in this regard. Since the 1960s, about 2.5 million technicians and engineers have received various levels of adult education or training each year, basically ensuring that all experts and leaders have the opportunity to receive continuing education every five years.

The lifelong nature of adult education requires the integration of the adult education system, first manifested in the fact that it is not education for a specific stage of life but education for all stages of a person's life. It allows adult in-service personnel to combine learning with work more closely. At the same time, it also requires adult education to meet the needs of adult learners in various aspects through various forms and structures. Now, many countries are actively developing their adult education systems in this direction.

Diversification of Adult Education Forms

In the late 1970s, universities facing society became a global trend. More and more countries are making full use of the superior faculty, teaching conditions, and equipment of universities to vigorously develop adult education. For example, the community colleges or junior colleges in the United States, the junior colleges in Japan, the people's universities in the Soviet Union, the junior technical universities in the Federal Republic of Germany, and the evening universities, correspondence schools, radio and television universities, and night schools in various countries. Some European countries have also set up comprehensive adult education centers with multiple functions. These centers are mostly jointly operated by enterprises and schools, with models mainly including the Workers' Training and Advanced Study Research Center in the Democratic Republic of Germany, the Technical Services and Training Center in the United Kingdom, and the Social and Economic Cooperation Development Center in Denmark. These centers provide various teaching facilities according to the different technical, academic, cultural, and entertainment needs of adults, so that they can update their original educational knowledge and experience to meet the requirements of social development. In addition, museums, libraries, theaters, clubs, and other cultural institutions in some countries are gradually forming adult education networks. For example, libraries at various levels in Japan's prefectures, cities, and counties play an important role in guiding and organizing adult learning or advanced study activities.

Modernization of Adult Education Methods

The development of modern technology has armed modern large-scale industrial production, and it has also provided a new technological foundation for modern educational methods. Since most adult education is of a part-time nature, the traditional teaching method of concentrated face-to-face instruction has significant limitations. Therefore, the achievements of modern communication technology play a unique role in adult education teaching. For example, radio teaching, television teaching, video teaching, computer teaching, and satellite teaching. Since the late 1950s, the United States has paid attention to the reform of adult education teaching methods and vigorously developed technical education. In the 1970s, the United States not only popularized electronic teaching in adult education but also adopted computer-assisted teaching and computer-managed teaching. In recent years, the United Kingdom has jointly compiled new teaching materials for adult education by scientists and educators. Each type of teaching material has a common feature: it has a complete set of textbooks, teacher manuals, experimental exercise books, as well as slides, films, audio and video tapes, and computer floppy disks. Practice has proven that the use of modern teaching methods can save teaching time and improve teaching quality, making the teaching content vivid and lively. The modernization of educational methods is playing a crucial role in the development of adult education.

　　国际成人教育发展态势
    余逸群
    成人教育是当代整个社会教育的一个重要组成部分。今天，国际成人教育的规模之大、形式之多、内容之丰富、教学方法之灵活，都是前所未有的。通过下列几个主要方面，我们可以了解国际成人教育的发展态势。
    成人教育立法化
    成人教育的发展，迫切要求人们对它的实施进行督导与管理，并使之制度化、法律化。
    第二次世界大战前，制定成人教育法的国家很少。战后，特别是60年代以来，很多国家开始着手进行成人教育的立法工作。日本从60年代以来，先后通过了几个有关成人教育的法案。特别是1980年由日本政府颁布的《成人教育法案》，对成人教育的地位、科研工作以及师资培训都作出了具体的规定。联邦德国于1975年正式制定了《成人教育职业法》，将在职人员的培训分为新技术或专业培训和中学后进修培训两种，并逐条作出详尽规定。成人教育法规的订立和实施，使成人教育在法律上得到了保障，从而促进了成人教育的发展。
    成人教育终身化
    伴随着60年代终身教育理论的兴盛，国际成人教育的另一显著特点是把成人教育置于终身教育体系之中加以发展。
    现代社会的发展日新月异，要求人们终身接受教育。随着成人教育普及水平的提高和成人教育年限的延长，保证成人教育终身化已经引起各国的关注。苏联在这方面比较突出。从60年代以来，每年约有250万技术员、工程师接受不同程度的成人教育或培训，基本上实现了每隔5年所有的专家和领导干部都有一次接受继续教育的机会。
    成人教育的终身化要求成人教育体系的一体化，首先表现在它不是面向人生某个阶段的教育，而是面向人的一生的各个阶段的教育。它使得成年在职人员可以把学习与工作更紧密地结合起来。同时，它也要求成人教育要以多种形式、多种结构满足成人学习者在各方面的需求。现在，许多国家都积极使成人教育体系朝着这一方向发展。
    成人教育形式多样化
    70年代后期，大学面向社会成为全球性的趋向。越来越多的国家充分利用大学优越的师资、教学条件和设备，大力发展成人教育。如美国的社区学院或初级学院、日本的短期大学、苏联的人民大学、联邦德国的短期技术大学，以及各国都有的业余大学、函授学校、广播电视大学、夜大学等等。欧洲一些国家还专门设置了多功能综合成人教育中心，这种中心多数是企校、厂校合办，其模式主要包括民主德国的工人培训与进修研究中心、英国的技术服务与培训中心、丹麦的社会与经济合作发展中心等。这些中心按照成人各自不同的技术、学术、文化和娱乐需要，提供各种教学设施，以便于他们更新原有的教育知识和经验，适应社会发展的要求。此外，一些国家的博物馆、图书馆、剧院、俱乐部及其他文化机构也在逐渐形成成人教育网络。例如，日本的都、道、府、县、市各级图书馆在指导和组织成人学习或进修活动方面起着重要作用。
　　成人教育手段现代化
    现代科技的发展武装了现代大工业生产，同时也为现代教育手段提供了新的技术基础。由于成人教育绝大多数属于业余性质，而集中面授的传统教学方式又有很大局限性。因此，现代通讯技术的成果在成人教育的教学上发挥着独特的作用。如广播教学、电视教学、录像教学、电子计算机教学、卫星教学等。从50年代末期，美国就注重成人教育的教学手段的改革，大力发展技术教育。进入70年代，美国不仅在成人教育中普及了电化教学，而且采用了计算机辅助教学、计算机管理教学。近年来，英国由科学家、教育家共同编写了成人教育的新教材，每类教材均有一个共同的特点，即都有一整套教科书、教师手册、实验练习册，以及幻灯片、电影片、录音录像带、计算机软盘等教学工具与实验用具。实践证明，运用现代化教学手段既能节省教学时间，又能提高教学质量，使教学内容形象生动。教育手段的现代化对成人教育的发展正发挥着至关重要的作用。
