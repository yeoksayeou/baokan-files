For Agricultural Bumper Harvests

Thousands of people are working together to build agricultural water conservancy projects, enhance drought resistance, and transform drought-prone and waterlogged areas, creating favorable conditions for a bumper harvest next year.

In Hebei's Linxi County, 1.53 million labor days were used this year. Fifteen townships mobilized both male and female laborers, along with several hundred vehicles, to repair 148 irrigation channels totaling 234.4 kilometers, drill 200 new wells, repair 300 old wells, build 100 kilometers of anti-seepage canals, transform 50,000 mu of drought-prone and waterlogged land, and create 100,000 mu of high-yield fields (see picture below).

During the autumn drought, the suburban military sub-district of Anhui's Taihe County organized militia to help villagers drill over 200 small wells, irrigating 33,000 mu of land, completing 85% of the autumn sowing area (see picture below).

From the end of October to the beginning of November, despite heavy military training tasks, over 300 soldiers from a certain artillery regiment of the Jinan Military Region were dispatched to support local agricultural water conservancy construction (see picture below).

The state-owned Dongxin Farm fully utilized loans from the World Bank and matching domestic funds to purchase agricultural machinery, achieving mechanization for farmland drainage and irrigation as well as water conservancy projects. The farm's water conservancy facilities reached the capability of "no disaster with 150 mm of rain in a day, guaranteed irrigation with no rain for 100 days," laying a solid foundation for the stable development of agriculture in the future.
