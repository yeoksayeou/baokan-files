Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 18th.

Notice from the People's Bank of China on the Monthly Publication of Savings Compensation Rates.

Since the introduction of the savings compensation scheme, it has achieved excellent results. Urban and rural residents have significantly increased their savings deposits, stabilizing the market and the financial sector, supporting national construction, and protecting the interests of a broad range of depositors. It has been well-received by the public.

To make the published compensation rates more aligned with actual conditions and more reasonable, with the approval of the State Council, starting from January 1990, the savings compensation rates will be published monthly instead of quarterly. The monthly published rates will still be calculated by the People's Bank of China based on the "National Retail Prices and Service Prices Index" provided monthly by the National Bureau of Statistics. The current calculation method remains unchanged.

After switching to monthly publication of compensation rates, the workload for savings business will increase significantly. We hope that all levels of banking savings departments will do everything possible to overcome difficulties, work even more actively and diligently to do a good job in savings compensation, and make new contributions to stabilizing the financial sector and protecting the interests of depositors.

    人民银行发布公告
    保值储蓄贴补率明年起按月公布
    新华社北京11月18日电　中国人民银行关于按月公布保值储蓄贴补率的公告。
    自开办保值储蓄以来，收到了很好的效果，城乡居民储蓄存款大量增加，稳定了市场，稳定了金融，支援了国家建设，保护了广大储户的利益，深受群众欢迎。
    为了使公布的保值贴补率进一步接近实际，更为合理，经国务院批准，从1990年1月开始，保值储蓄贴补率由原来的按季公布改为按月公布。按月公布的贴补率仍由人民银行根据国家统计局按月提供的“全国社会商品零售及服务项目价格总指数”计算，现行计算方法不变。
    按月公布贴补率后，将给储蓄业务增加成倍的工作量，望各级银行储蓄部门千方百计克服困难，更加积极努力地做好保值储蓄工作，为稳定金融、保护储户利益做出新的贡献。
