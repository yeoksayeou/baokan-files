The State Council recently approved the Ministry of Materials' "Opinion on Further Cleanup and Rectification of Various Material Companies." This opinion proposes to focus on the cleanup and rectification of various material companies by shutting down or merging those that do not meet the conditions for operation and dealing with important industrial raw materials, thus solving the problems of excessive and chaotic operations in the circulation of industrial raw materials.

The opinion clearly stipulates that the following five types of material companies should be shut down:

1. Material companies established by party and government agencies, social organizations, and their branch offices stationed in other places;
2. Material companies that lack actual registered capital, personnel, operating premises, organizational structure, and other conditions for establishment;
3. Material companies that exploit price "dual-track" loopholes for illegal resale activities to make profits;
4. Material companies that, in collaboration with enterprises and units lacking the qualification to operate important industrial raw materials, engage in the operation of important industrial raw materials;
5. Material companies that, in violation of the State Council's regulations, have been established by production management departments that should have transferred their material supply and marketing institutions to the Ministry of Materials.

The opinion points out that, in accordance with the State Council's regulations, production management departments that do not transfer their material supply and marketing institutions to the Ministry of Materials should, in principle, set up only one material supply and marketing institution. The supply and marketing institutions of production enterprises should be strictly controlled and not set up at multiple levels. The operation of important industrial raw materials by collective enterprises must be strictly controlled, and those not approved by the material management department are not allowed to operate. Private enterprises and individual business households are not allowed to operate important industrial raw materials except for self-produced and self-sold products. Various labor service companies are also not allowed to operate important industrial raw materials. The operation of related important industrial raw materials by supply and marketing cooperatives at various levels should be carried out in accordance with the relevant regulations of the State Council.

The opinion also stipulates that companies and individual business households that have their qualifications to operate important industrial raw materials revoked must immediately cease operations and go through the cancellation or change of registration with the local industrial and commercial administrative authorities. Unsold important industrial raw materials should be sold or purchased by local legal material companies.

    国务院批转物资部《意见》
    进一步清理整顿各类物资公司
    明确规定五类公司应撤销
    新华社北京11月7日电  国务院最近批转了物资部《关于进一步清理整顿各类物资公司的意见》，这一《意见》提出，清理整顿各类物资公司的重点是，撤并一批不符合开办条件经营重要工业品生产资料的公司，解决生产资料流通中公司过多过滥、经营混乱的问题。
    《意见》明确规定，五类物资公司应予撤销：
    （一）党政机关、社会团体及其派驻外地的办事机构开办的各类物资公司；
    （二）实际注册资金、从业人员、经营场地、组织机构等不具备开办条件的物资公司；
    （三）靠钻价格“双轨制”的空子，从事非法倒买倒卖活动牟取利润的物资公司；
    （四）各类物资公司与不具备重要工业品生产资料经营资格的企业、单位建立的经营重要工业品生产资料的联营公司；
    （五）按照国务院规定，应将物资供销机构移交物资部门管理的生产主管部门重复建立的物资公司。
    《意见》指出，按照国务院规定，物资供销机构不移交物资部门管理的生产主管部门，原则上只能设一个物资供销机构，生产企业的供销机构要从严掌握，不要层层设置。集体企业经营重要工业品生产资料，必须从严掌握，未经物资管理部门批准的，不准经营；私营企业、个体工商户除自产自销产品外，不准经营重要工业品生产资料；各类劳动服务公司也不准经营重要工业品生产资料；各级供销社经营有关重要工业生产资料，按国务院的有关规定执行。
    《意见》还规定，凡取消重要工业品生产资料经营资格的公司和个体工商户必须立即停业，向所在地工商行政管理机关办理注销登记或变更登记。未销出的重要工业品生产资料，由当地合法物资公司代销或收购。
