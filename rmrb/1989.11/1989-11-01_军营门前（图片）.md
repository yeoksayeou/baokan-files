    In Front of the Military Camp

    If there were no sentries on guard, one might mistake this for a corner of a farmers' market. In the golden autumn season, fruits are abundant, and farmers' markets are bustling with activity. However, some farmers and peddlers do not set up stalls in the market but instead gather in front of the military barracks, making it hard to understand their motives. The presence of farmers and peddlers in front of the barracks not only disrupts the normal order of the military but also causes inconvenience to management. Their business is not necessarily thriving. The military has repeatedly sent people to politely persuade them, but to no avail. It is hoped that local authorities will assist the military in doing some work with these people.

    军营门前
    如果没有站岗的哨兵，你会认为这是农贸市场的一角。金秋季节，水果大量上市，农贸市场热闹非常，可是有些果农和小贩不去市场设摊，却来到驻军营房前，令人很难理解出于什么心理？果农、小贩聚在营房前既影响了部队的正常秩序，给管理工作带来不便，生意未必兴隆。部队多次派人婉言规劝，但无济于事。希望地方有关部门协助部队做做这些人的工作。河北唐山驻军某部　戴广运
