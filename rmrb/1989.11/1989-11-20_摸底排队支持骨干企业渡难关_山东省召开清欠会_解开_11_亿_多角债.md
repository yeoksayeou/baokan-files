The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's Shandong branch has actively assisted enterprises in overcoming difficulties. In a meeting held on November 17 and 18, attended by 15 city and prefecture-level branches, the provincial branch injected 100 million yuan in startup loans. This helped over 500 key large and medium-sized enterprises in the province to untangle 1.1 billion yuan in "multi-party debts."

Since the fourth quarter of last year, industrial and commercial enterprises in Shandong have been mutually defaulting on loans, with the total amount now reaching 2.5 billion yuan. This has caused significant difficulties for many enterprises' production and operations. For example, the Shandong-based Qilu Petrochemical Company, a super-large key enterprise, has been owed 350 million yuan.

To help enterprises quickly resolve these debt issues and effectively support economically efficient large and medium-sized key enterprises to get out of their predicaments, the bank organized this large-scale debt-clearing activity based on a thorough survey and prioritization. The Industrial and Commercial Bank acted as an agent for the enterprises to clear debts across the province, and the bank covered the shortfall through interbank lending.

To prevent the recurrence of delayed payments after clearing, the bank also assisted enterprises in improving their financial management: first, by using bills of exchange for settlements, and second, by establishing over 700 internal banks within large and medium-sized enterprises. It is reported that the 428 large and medium-sized enterprises supported by loans from this bank saw an average increase of 11.24% in industrial output value and a 13.2% increase in profits and taxes in the first 10 months of this year compared to the same period last year.

    摸底排队支持骨干企业渡难关
    山东省召开清欠会  解开11亿“多角债”
    本报济南11月19日电　工商银行山东省分行积极为企业排忧解难，在本月17、18两天有全省15家地、市工商行参加的清理拖欠贷款会上，省行注入1亿元启动贷款，帮助全省500多家大中型骨干企业解开了11亿元的“多角债”。
    去年第四季度以来，山东全省工商企业相互之间拖欠债款，目前总额已达25亿元，给许多企业的生产经营带来很大困难。山东特大型骨干企业齐鲁石化公司，被拖欠资金达3.5亿元。
    为帮助企业尽快解开债务“死结”，有效地支持经济效益好的大中型骨干企业摆脱困境，这家银行在摸底排队的基础上，组织了这次大型清欠活动，由工商行代理企业在全省范围跨地、市进行清欠，需要支付的由工商银行通过资金拆借弥补差额。
    为避免前清后欠，这家银行还帮助企业提高资金的管理水平：一是用汇票结算，二是在大中型企业建起700多家内部银行。据悉，由该行贷款支持的428户大中型企业，今年头10个月工业产值平均比去年同期增长11.24％，利税增长13.2％。
