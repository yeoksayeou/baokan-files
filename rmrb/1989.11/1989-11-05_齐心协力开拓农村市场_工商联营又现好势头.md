According to a report by the *Market News*, by June of this year, the previously highly sought-after Flying Pigeon brand bicycles had accumulated tens of thousands of unsold units in the factory. The Bicycle Association of the Ministry of Light Industry sought assistance from the Business Management Office of the Commercial Department's Supply and Marketing Cooperative to expand sales channels. The Business Management Office convened representatives from the supply and marketing cooperatives of Liaoning, Shaanxi, Hebei, and Hubei provinces to place orders in Tianjin, purchasing 330,000 Flying Pigeon bicycles. The leadership of the Tianjin Flying Pigeon Bicycle Group Company expressed relief, remarking, "We didn't expect the demand in rural areas to be so high. We were on the verge of not being able to pay salaries, but the supply and marketing cooperative helped us out of this difficulty."

In recent months, similar to the Flying Pigeon Bicycle Group Company, many electric fan, sewing machine, washing machine, and television manufacturers across the country have also collaborated with various levels of supply and marketing cooperatives. They have leveraged the "legs" of the supply and marketing cooperatives to deliver products to the countryside and utilized the supply and marketing cooperatives as a window to observe the rural market, gaining information and adjusting product structures. The supply and marketing cooperatives have obtained previously hard-to-get supplies, and the profit margins from buying and selling are larger than purchasing from wholesale stations. According to the Business Management Office of the Commercial Department's Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the current proportion of joint purchasing and distribution sales volume in the supply and marketing cooperative system accounts for 30% to 40% of the total sales volume.

The changes in the market have brought factories and supply and marketing cooperatives together. This year, the market has shown signs of weakness, but farmers' potential purchasing power remains strong. The market share of some industrial products in rural areas is still low, and there are not many products that are suitable for the market and reasonably priced.

Experts believe that as long as different regions and different levels of consumers' needs are considered, and efforts are made to ensure that products are suitable for the market and reasonably priced, industrial and commercial joint ventures to expand the rural market have a very broad prospect.

Currently, some urban commercial departments are also leveraging the supply and marketing cooperatives to step out of the city and into the countryside. City-countryside commercial cooperation is thriving. The Beijing Municipal Electric Power Company, in its collaboration with the Ba County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei, provided 500,000 yuan in working capital to the latter and treated the latter's third-level wholesale unit as a second-level wholesale unit. With a stable financial base and guaranteed supply, the Ba County Supply and Marketing Cooperative's sales from the Beijing Municipal Electric Power Company reached over 100 million yuan from January to August this year, not only supplying the local area but also radiating to surrounding regions and rural areas in Tianjin and Northeast China.

Some business people believe that supply and marketing cooperatives have the advantages of wide coverage, multiple channels, and quick response. Collaborating with them in wholesale, joint sales, agency sales, and exhibition sales to expand the rural market has great potential.

### 齐心协力开拓农村市场  工商联营又现好势头

    齐心协力开拓农村市场
    工商联营又现好势头
    本报讯　据《市场报》报道：到今年6月份，以前一直很抢手的飞鸽牌自行车，在工厂积压了几十万辆，轻工业部自行车协会向商业部供销管理司业务处求助扩大销路。供销司业务处召集辽宁、陕西、河北、湖北等省供销社派人赴津，订购了飞鸽自行车33万辆。天津飞鸽自行车集团公司领导如释重负，颇有感慨地说：“想不到农村需求这么大。眼看工资都发不出来了，供销社为我们排了难，解了忧。”为了巩固这个市场，他们迅速在一些省、市供销社设立了办事处、维修点，长期供货。
    近几个月来，像飞鸽自行车集团公司一样，全国不少电风扇、缝纫机、洗衣机、电视机生产厂家，也纷纷与各级供销社联合，借“腿”送产品下乡，并利用供销社这个瞭望农村市场的窗口，获得信息，调整产品结构。供销社得到了以前难以得到的货源，且进销差价比从批发站进货大。据商业部供销管理司业务处介绍，现在全国供销社系统联购分销额占总销售额的比重高达30％—40％。
    市场的变化，使工厂、供销社走到了一起。今年市场出现疲软，但是，农民的潜在购买力还很强，一些工业品在农村市场的占有率还很低，适销对路、价格合理的商品还不多。
    行家认为，只要根据不同地区，不同层次消费者的需求，在商品花色品种适销对路上下功夫，工商联合开拓农村市场，前景十分广阔。
    眼下一些城市商业部门也借供销社之力，走出城圈，迈向原野，城乡之间的商商合作方兴未艾。北京市交电公司在与河北霸县供销社的联合中，借给对方50万元流动资金，还将对方三级批发单位当作二级批发单位对待。霸县供销社资金有了底，货源有保证，今年1—8月，从北京市交电公司批发的商品价值达1000多万元，除供应本县外，还辐射到周围地区及天津、东北等地农村。
    一些工商界人士认为，供销社点多、面广、耳灵、腿长，有联络广、渠道多的优势，与其开展批发、联销、代销、展销等联合，开拓农村市场，大有作为。
