The issue of "sky lamps" burning day and night above petrochemical enterprises has finally been resolved in Shanghai. The Shanghai 711 Research Institute and the Shanghai Petrochemical Company collaborated to overcome this technical challenge. They have successfully built the first ethylene flare gas screw compressor recovery system in China at the Shanghai Petrochemical Plant No. 1. After more than 5,000 hours of operation, the system has proven to be safe and reliable.

The ethylene flares in petrochemical enterprises have long been considered a technical problem that is difficult to solve. Even when the Shanghai Petrochemical Company imported complete sets of equipment from abroad, the "sky lamp" issue remained unresolved. In 1987, the Refining and Chemical Department of the Shanghai Petrochemical Company and the Shanghai 711 Research Institute decided to jointly tackle this problem. After two years of hard work, they successfully developed the "wet screw compressor flare gas recovery device." This device can directly transfer the waste gas that was previously released to the flare stack for combustion to the combustion system, serving as a secondary energy source. This recovery system can recover 7.68 million cubic meters of flare gas annually, equivalent to 1.84 million yuan. If the gas from hundreds of flare stacks in China's petrochemical industry could be recovered, it would create billions of yuan in wealth for the nation.

    上海攻克一项技术难关
    乙烯火炬回收装置建成  石化企业可不再点天灯
    本报上海11月7日电  石化企业上空日夜燃烧的“天灯”，日前已在上海获得解决。上海711所和上海石化总厂协作攻关，在上海石化一厂建成了我国第一个乙烯火炬气螺杆压缩机回收系统，经5000多小时运行证明安全可靠。
    石化企业上空的乙烯火炬，一直被认为是可望而不可即的技术难题。上海石化总厂从国外引进成套设备时，“天灯”问题也未能解决。1987年，上海石化总厂炼油化工部与上海711所决定联合攻关。经过两年奋战，终于研制成功“湿式螺杆压缩机火炬回收装置”，它能将运行中的原来排放至火炬塔燃烧的瓦斯气，直接输往燃烧系统，作为二次能源。这套回收装置每年能回收火炬气768万多立方米，折合人民币184万多元。如果我国石化行业数百个火炬塔的气都能回收，就可为国家创造几亿元的财富。
