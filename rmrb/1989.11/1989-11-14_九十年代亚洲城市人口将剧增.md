	To the 1990s, the number of densely populated cities in Asia will see a dramatic increase compared to the past. This requires the addition of housing and corresponding facilities, the improvement of transportation, and the resolution of other infrastructure issues. This is the conclusion reached by experts after a targeted investigation into the development of the Asian Development Bank.

	The investigation points out that by the end of this century, among the 25 megacities in the world, Asia will have 12. These include Calcutta in India (with a total urban population of 16.5 million), Mumbai (16 million); and Shanghai in China (14.3 million). The increase in population is mainly due to the influx of people from rural areas. It is estimated that in India, the urban population will increase by 98 million, in China by 73 million, in Indonesia by 25 million, and in Thailand by 7 million.

     九十年代亚洲城市人口将剧增
     “到二十世纪九十年代，人口稠密的亚洲城市数量和过去相比，将急剧上升。这就需补充住房和相应设施、完善交通，其他基础结构问题也要解决。”这是专家们对亚洲银行发展进行的有目的的调查后，所做的结论。
    这个调查指出，到本世纪末，在世界上25个特大都市中，亚洲将占12个。它们包括印度的加尔各答
  （城市居民总数将达1650万）、孟买（1600万）；中国的上海（1430万）。增长的居民人数主要是从农村流入的。预计在印度，市民人数将增加9800万，中国增加7300万，印度尼西亚增加2500万，泰国也将增加700万。
