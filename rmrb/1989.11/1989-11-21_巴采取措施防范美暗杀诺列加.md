Panama's Defense Forces announced on the 19th that they are on high alert to prevent the United States from harming Panama's strongman Noriega.

The Committee for the Defense of the Homeland and Dignity of Panama, seen as the third force within Panama's Defense Forces, issued a statement on the 19th, announcing the deployment of permanent patrols in "resistance centers" across the country's urban and rural areas. This is to counter the CIA's secret plans to assassinate Panama's military commander Noriega.

According to reports, starting from the evening of the 17th, a "special civilian action team" composed of young people in Panama began monitoring Americans and Panamanians collaborating with the U.S. to prevent them from taking action against Noriega.
