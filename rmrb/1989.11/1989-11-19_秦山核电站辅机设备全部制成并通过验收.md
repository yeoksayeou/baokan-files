Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 18th.

The auxiliary equipment for the 300,000-kilowatt Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant has been fully manufactured at the Shanghai Power Plant Auxiliary Machinery Factory and has recently passed the handover inspection.

This batch of auxiliary equipment consists of 14 items and 25 sets, with a total weight of 1,300 tons. It includes essential supporting equipment for nuclear power such as high-pressure heaters, low-pressure heaters, condensers, deaerators, and water tanks. The successful manufacture and inspection of these main auxiliary equipment for nuclear power indicate that Shanghai is not only capable of manufacturing steam turbines, generators, boilers, and nuclear island cores—the main equipment for nuclear power—but also the important auxiliary equipment that goes with them. This marks a new breakthrough in China's overall manufacturing level of nuclear power equipment.

    秦山核电站辅机设备全部制成并通过验收
    据新华社上海11月18日电　（通讯员凌赵）秦山30万千瓦核电站所需的二回路大型辅机设备，已在上海电站辅机厂全部制造完成，并于最近通过交接验收。
    这批辅机共14项、25套，总重1300吨。其中包括高压加热器、低压加热器、冷凝器、除氧器及水箱等核电必不可少的配套设备。核电主要辅机设备的制造成功和通过验收表明，上海不仅能够制造核电所需的汽轮机、发电机、锅炉和核岛心脏等主机，也能制造与之配套的重要辅机。这标志着我国核电设备的整体制造水平有了新的突破。
