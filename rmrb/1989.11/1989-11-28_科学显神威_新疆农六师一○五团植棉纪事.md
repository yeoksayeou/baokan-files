In the autumn of 1989, when news of a bumper cotton harvest came from the land that had never grown good cotton before, the cadres and workers of the 105th Regiment of the 6th Agricultural Division in Xinjiang truly understood why science is said to be productive. Are the people of the 105th Regiment "lazy"?

On August 11, 1988, 57-year-old veteran political commissar Qiao Shiren and 42-year-old regiment commander Zhou Xuchu took office in the 105th Regiment. Before them lay a pile of figures: the regiment had lost 1 million yuan in a year, with debts of 6.1 million yuan, and had accumulated losses of 13.5 million yuan over 29 years. The division leaders had instructed them to change the face of the 105th Regiment, and to do so, they must grow cotton well. However, everyone in the regiment agreed: cotton is not suitable here. They had their reasons. Since 1963, they had almost always planted cotton, but never had a bumper harvest, with an average yield of 15 kilograms per mu, and the lowest yield in one year was only 6 kilograms.

The 105th Regiment is located on the southern edge of the Junggar Basin's alluvial plain. The 106th Regiment to the north had long been a major cotton producer, and the 111th Regiment to the south had also achieved high cotton yields in recent years. Why couldn't they grow cotton here? The regiment leaders were deep in thought.

Zhou Xuchu recalled two incidents:

In 1981, when he was a technician in the 106th Regiment, people from the 105th Regiment came to learn about cotton planting. After seeing the guests off, the regiment's top leaders told him: "They can't do it." "Why?" "Because they are hardworking but not striving." Six years later, as the production director of the 111th Regiment, Zhou Xuchu was invited to the 105th Regiment to share cotton planting experience. At the end, a division office director also said: "They can't do it." "Why?" "Because they are lazy."

Today, Zhou Xuchu is the regiment commander of the 105th Regiment, and he is determined to explore the meaning of this "laziness."

Are the people of the 105th Regiment lazy? In 1959, they started from scratch and established a farm in the barren Gobi Desert. It was they who built the first well-irrigated farm in Xinjiang under harsh conditions. In the 1960s, they cultivated the famous white cabbage and melons known throughout the region. However, Zhou Xuchu indeed experienced another kind of "laziness": conservatism, lack of scientific knowledge, closed information, and short-sightedness. Planting melons to save labor and reduce costs, only focusing on immediate gains, this is the biggest form of laziness. Lessons learned from criticism

The office departments took over the brigades, and the leaders ran to the grassroots. They worked hard but saw little effect. Complaints and curses were everywhere: "Just plant it, at worst, we'll cover the cost of planting melons." "Give the cadres some face, so they can step down easily."

"Going against natural laws and not adapting to local conditions will lead to losses."

"The office bureaucrats, you sit in the office and come up with crazy ideas, why don't you try planting yourselves."

The words were harsh and piercing. But upon reflection, it was true. No matter how much you talk, it's better to do it yourself. "Let's try planting ourselves." Qiao Shiren's suggestion was supported, and each office worker was assigned one mu of cotton, with the task of writing an experience report in the fall.

As the saying goes, when it rains, it pours. Drought and low temperatures like two poisonous snakes strangled the spring plowing. The workers were frantic. Zhou Xuchu, along with the production director and technical staff, inspected the fields one by one. Whether to plant cotton here or change to corn there, he made the decisions on the spot, and the technical measures were also supervised by him. He became a real "Zhou Assistant."

In his spare time, Qiao Shiren focused on his experimental field. After returning from trips, he always went to the field before going home. The sticky soil made it hard for the seeds to sprout, so he knelt on the ground and dug out each seedling, his back aching and his hands bleeding. His children came to help, but he said, this help you can't give, the taste of the plow must be experienced personally. For replanting, he held the hoe with one hand and a water bottle with the other, poked a hole, dropped a few seeds, poured some water, and covered it with soil. Finally, he ensured full germination. For weeding, he pulled weeds 11 times, looking at the lush cotton field, he sighed in relief.

In the fall, the office's 70 mu of experimental cotton field had a bumper harvest, with an average yield of over 70 kilograms per mu. Qiao Shiren's one mu of land yielded 107 kilograms per mu, taking the top spot. He summarized his experience: ensuring full germination, winter irrigation, and scientific farming are key. People were convinced, but some still mocked, saying, in the 1980s, we have remote control, why use this method? Qiao Shiren smiled and said, no matter the era, we must not lose the spirit of hard work and struggle.

The land is honest

In the fall, a reporter visited the Youth Brigade. A few acquaintances were busy picking cotton. "How's the cotton?" "It grew, but it's too labor-intensive." "What about the melons?" "They were destroyed, unsellable." Yang Zechun, a young worker who hadn't grown cotton successfully in five years, had a yield of 52 kilograms per mu on his 9 mu of cotton field; Guo Chunlan, a young woman, with her father's technical guidance and mother's help, achieved high yield, already delivering 1,423 kilograms of lint cotton, with a yield of 100.9 kilograms per mu.

This is a segment of an interview from the 9th Brigade:

Wen Shuchang (Instructor): In the spring, everyone said this was spending money to buy trouble. A worker said he was willing to pay 500 yuan to have someone else plant it, but no one would do it. By mid-April, 250 mu were planted, but only 40% sprouted. I asked the regiment commander what to do? He said, replant, and there's still hope before the Grain in Ear Festival. During replanting, whoever was sent didn't go, everyone's mind was on the melons. On May 19, replanting was completed, the workers said, anyway, we won't make money, whatever we plant, we plant.

Li Wengui (Brigade Commander): No one took the initiative to contract cotton, so the party branch decided that party members should take the lead. In the large fields, there were 3 party members plus me and the instructor who became the group leaders for 5 plots of cotton. Management was assigned to individuals, and if the workers didn't go to the fields, we were like cuckoos, urging them, and when we urged too much, we were scolded.

Li Wengui: The regiment commander came and said to spray diammonium phosphate and leaf fertilizer. We followed the instructions. The cotton seedlings grew rapidly, the regiment commander said to spray mepiquat chloride, after spraying, the bolls were abundant, bending the waist. On September 10, we sprayed ethephon according to the requirements, promoting the late flowering of the late-maturing variety, and it was only at this time that the workers' faces brightened.

Wen Shuchang: My wife heard Zhou, the regiment commander, talk about cotton planting three years ago and told me, 50 kilograms per mu of cotton, that's boasting. This year, her yield is 75 kilograms per mu. She said science really works.

The land is honest. Science is practical. The 105th Regiment's 1,550 mu of cotton this year had an average yield of 55 kilograms per mu, with a total yield of 80,000 kilograms, and a profit of over 100 yuan per mu.

　　——新疆农六师一○五团植棉纪事

    1989年秋天，当从来长不好棉花的黄土地上传来棉花丰收的喜讯时，新疆农6师105团的干部职工真正懂得了为什么说科学就是生产力。105团人“懒”吗？
    1988年8月11日，57岁的老政委乔世荣和42岁的团长周旭初到105团走马上任，摆在他们面前的是这样一堆数字：全团一年亏损100万元，债务高达610万元，29年累计亏损1350万元。临来时师领导嘱咐，要改变105团面貌，必须种好棉花。可是，全团上下众口一辞：这里种棉花不适合。他们这么讲不是没有原因，自1963年以来，差不多年年种棉，可从未见丰产，平均亩产15公斤，最少的一年只有6公斤。
    105团地处准噶尔盆地南缘冲积平原，北面的106团早已成了棉花大户，南面的111团近些年也获棉花高产，为什么就这里种不成棉花？团领导陷入了深思。
    强扭的瓜儿不甜。周旭初想起了两件往事：
    1981年，他在106团当技术员时，105团派人来学习种棉花。送走客人，团主要领导对他说：“他们种不成。”“为什么？”“只艰苦不奋斗。”6年后，担任了111团生产科长的周旭初应邀到105团传授植棉经验。末了，一位师机关处长也说：“他们种不成。”“为什么？”“人懒。”
    今天，周旭初当了105团团长，他决心探索一下这个“懒”字。
    105团人懒吗？1959年，他们白手起家，在一无所有的戈壁滩上创办了农场。正是他们在艰苦的条件下建成了新疆第一个井溉农场。60年代，他们培育出了闻名全疆的大白菜、甜瓜。然而，周旭初确实也领略到了另一种“懒”：因循守旧，不懂科学，信息闭塞，目光短浅。一窝风种省工省成本的打瓜。只顾眼前捞一把，这就是最大的懒。骂声中悟出来的道理
    机关科室包连队，领导干部跑基层。辛苦不少，效果不好。到处都有人发牢骚，有人骂娘：“种吧，大不了把打瓜的钱贴上。”“给干部们一点面子，叫他们好下台。”
    “违背自然规律，不搞因地制宜是要吃亏的。”
    “机关老爷们，你们坐在办公室出瞎点子，自己种种看。”
    话不好听，刺耳。可静静一想，也是，说一千道一万，不如动手干一干。“咱们也种种看。”乔世荣的提议受到拥护，机关人员一人一亩棉，秋后写一条经验，这是死任务。
    俗话说，屋漏偏逢连阴雨。干旱低温像两条毒蛇绞着春耕。职工急得团团转。周旭初带着生产科长、技术人员挨着条田检查。这块种棉花，那块改种玉米都由他现场拍板，技术措施一条条也由他监督执行。他成了名副其实的“周帮办”。
    业余时间，乔世荣一门心思种试验田。外出归来，总是先到地头后进家。胶土地，难出苗，他跪在地上一棵一棵抠，腰疼得直不起来，手指出了血。儿女们来帮忙，他说，这忙你们帮不了，犁子的滋味得自个尝。补苗，他一手抓住锹把，一手提水壶，戳个洞，丢几粒种，倒点水，盖一把土。最后终于保证了全苗。中耕管理，他拔了11遍草，看着绿油油的棉田，他舒了一口气。
      秋天，机关70亩棉花试验田丰收了，平均亩产超过70公斤，乔世荣的一亩地亩产107公斤，一举夺魁。他总结的经验是：抓全苗，要冬溉，科学种田是关键。人们服气了，但是也有人挖苦说，80年代，都搞遥控了，还用这种办法。乔世荣笑笑说，什么时代都不能丢了艰苦奋斗精神。
      土地是诚实的
    秋天，记者来到青年连，几个熟人正忙着摘棉花。“棉花怎么样？”“种是种成了，就是太费工。”“打瓜呢？”“砸了，卖不出。”5年没种成棉花的青年工人杨泽春9亩棉田，亩产52公斤；女青年郭春兰4.7亩棉田，在父亲的技术指导和母亲的帮助下，获得高产，已交皮棉1423公斤，亩产100.9公斤。
      这是在9连的一段采访录：
    文树奇（指导员）：开春播种，大伙说这是花钱买辛苦。有个职工说，他愿意倒贴500元请人代种，也没人干。4月中旬播完250亩，出苗只有40％，我问团长咋办？他说，重播，赶在小满前都有希望。重播时派谁谁不去，人的心思都在打瓜上。5月19日重播完毕，职工说反正拿不上钱，种啥样啥样。
    李文贵（连长）：棉花承包谁也不伸头，支部决定党员带头。大田有3个党员加上我和指导员当了5块棉田的组长。管理到人，职工不下地，我们像布谷鸟，挨着催，催紧了，还挨骂。
    李文贵：团长来了，说喷施磷酸二氢钾、叶面宝。我们照办了。棉花苗疯长，团长说打缩节胺，打后结桃了，特多，压弯了腰。9月10日，我们按要求打乙烯利，促贪青晚熟的开花，真到这时候，职工的脸色才好看了。
    文树奇：我老婆3年前听过周团长讲种棉，回来对我说，棉花50公斤，吹牛。她今年亩产75公斤。她说科学还真管用。
    土地是诚实的。科学是求实的。105团今年1550亩棉花平均亩产55公斤，总产8万公斤，亩获利超过100元。
