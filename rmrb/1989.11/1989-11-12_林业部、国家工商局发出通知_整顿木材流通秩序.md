The Ministry of Forestry and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce recently jointly issued a notice, requiring various levels of authorities to streamline timber circulation channels, rectify the order of timber circulation, and stop illegal transactions.

Currently, China's forest stock volume is continuously decreasing, especially in the timber forests where mature and over-mature trees are nearly exhausted. Strengthening the management of the timber market is an important link to ensure quota logging and stop illegal logging. The joint notice has made specific regulations on units that can operate non-planned timber. It is stipulated that except for state-owned forest areas, forestry enterprises, and forestry management departments' affiliated wood processing units, other units and individuals are not allowed to operate timber. Supply and marketing cooperatives in timber-producing areas are only allowed to operate various small materials and small timber. Individual industrial and commercial households in timber-selling areas are only allowed to purchase and sell small materials and used timber from local timber-operating units and are not allowed to directly purchase timber from forest areas or transport timber.

The notice also requires that collective forest areas at the county level should actively create conditions to gradually establish fixed timber markets, with timber being purchased by professional timber-operating units under the local forestry authorities. All units operating timber must have qualified inspectors who have passed the assessment to measure and mark the timber. The measurement must strictly follow national standards and must not be falsified.

    林业部、国家工商局发出通知
    整顿木材流通秩序
    本报北京11月11日讯　林业部、国家工商行政管理局最近联合发出通知，要求各级主管部门理顺木材流通渠道，整顿木材流通秩序，制止非法交易。
    目前，我国森林蓄积量持续减少，特别是用材林中的成、过熟林，可采资源已濒于枯竭。加强木材市场管理，是确保限额采伐、制止乱砍滥伐的重要环节。联合通知就可以经营非统配木材的单位作了具体规定，规定除国有林区森工企业及森工管理部门所属的归口经营木材单位等7个部门外，其它单位和个人不得经营木材。产材地区的供销社只限经营各种小材小料。木材销区的个体工商户，只准从当地木材经营单位进货零售和经营旧木料，不准直接到林区收购，不准贩运木材。
    通知还要求，集体林区县要积极创造条件逐步建立固定的木材市场，木材由当地林业主管部门的专业木材经营单位进山收购。凡经营木材的单位，必须有经过考核合格的检尺人员检尺，并打上标记。要严格按照国家标准检尺，不得弄虚作假。
