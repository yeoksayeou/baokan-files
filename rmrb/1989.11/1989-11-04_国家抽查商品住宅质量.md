To understand the overall quality level of commercial housing in China, identify common quality issues and their causes, and promote the improvement of management and quality in commercial housing construction, the State Administration for Quality and Technical Supervision has tasked the National Building Engineering Quality Supervision and Testing Center to conduct a nationwide inspection of commercial housing quality. Currently, experts have gathered in Beijing and will be dispatched to Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Harbin, and Shenyang to carry out quality supervision inspections.

This quality supervision inspection is a mandatory random inspection. In each city, five companies involved in the construction and operation of commercial housing will be inspected, and two buildings completed last year or this year will be inspected from each company. The quality of each building will be evaluated according to national standards. The inspection work is scheduled to be completed by the end of November. The results of the commercial housing quality supervision inspection will be announced at that time.
