The Ethiopian government and the opposition armed group, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, reached an agreement on the selection of the conference chairperson and secretariat members during their latest round of preliminary talks held in Nairobi on the 23rd. The name of the conference chairperson has not yet been disclosed, but local sources widely speculate that it is Tanzania's former President Nyerere. He will, along with former U.S. President Carter, preside over the subsequent substantive negotiations aimed at ending the 28-year-long Eritrean war.
