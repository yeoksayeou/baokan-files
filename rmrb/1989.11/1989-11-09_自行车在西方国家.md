		Bicycles in Western Countries
		Xú Bùqīng
		Cars have long been the primary mode of transportation in Western countries, while bicycles have mainly been used for physical exercise. Now, with environmental problems becoming increasingly severe, more and more people are viewing bicycles as the cleanest form of transportation. From legislators, judges, and professors to civil servants and janitors, many people prefer to ride bicycles to work.

		Most families in Western developed countries own cars. The exhaust fumes from cars are poisoning urban residents like a plague and eroding buildings. Bicycles, on the other hand, do not pollute the air and do not produce noise, making them beneficial for environmental protection. According to statistics from the American magazine "World Watch," many large cities need to allocate one-third of their land for roads and parking lots. Bicycles, however, take up little space and can save a lot of land.

		Riding bicycles is also beneficial for health. Cardiologists point out that cycling, like swimming and walking, is one of the most beneficial activities for the heart. Additionally, Western countries rely heavily on imported oil, which places a significant burden on their economies. Promoting bicycles as a means of transportation is a measure to conserve energy.

		Currently, many Western countries are actively taking steps to expand bicycle production and encourage people to ride bicycles. In recent years, more and more people in the Federal Republic of Germany enjoy riding bicycles to and from work and for outings. To this end, the federal government will build 3,000 kilometers of bicycle lanes, with a total investment of 1 billion marks. In Britain, many cities often experience traffic congestion due to the high number of cars. Consequently, more and more people are choosing to ride bicycles to avoid traffic jams. About 1 million people nationwide primarily commute by bicycle. In the United States, where cars are as numerous as stars in the sky, bicycle sales have increased by 50% in the past three years, with approximately 50 million people owning mountain bikes. The Netherlands, with a population of less than 20 million, has over 11 million bicycles and has built 9,000 miles of bicycle lanes.

		Of course, bicycles cannot replace cars, but they can coexist with cars and other means of transportation, and can replace cars for short distances. They do not conflict with the fast pace of modern Western life. Therefore, bicycles are increasingly valued in Western countries.

    自行车在西方国家
    徐步青
    汽车历来是西方国家的主要交通工具，自行车则仅仅被用于锻炼身体。如今，环境问题日趋严重，越来越多的人们将自行车视作最干净的交通工具。从议员、法官、教授到公务员和勤杂工，不少人都喜欢骑车上班。
    西方发达国家的多数家庭都拥有小汽车。汽车排出的废气，像瘟疫一样严重毒害着城市居民，侵蚀着建筑物。而骑自行车一不污染空气，二不产生噪音，有利于保护环境。据美国《世界观察》杂志统计，许多大城市必须拿出1／3的土地来修建道路和停车场。而自行车占地面积小，可节省大量土地。
    骑自行车也有益于身体健康。心脏病专家指出，骑车与游泳、散步一样，是对心脏最为有益的活动。此外，西方国家石油消费依赖进口，这给国民经济带来不小负担。而推广自行车作为交通工具是节约能源的一项措施。
    目前，西方许多国家积极采取措施扩大自行车生产，鼓励人们骑自行车。近年来，越来越多的联邦德国人喜欢骑自行车上下班、郊游。为此联邦政府将建3000公里的自行车道，总投资达10亿马克。英国许多城市，也因汽车多经常造成交通堵塞。因而越来越多的人为免受堵车之苦而改骑自行车。全国约100万人主要靠骑车上下班。在汽车多如牛毛的美国，近三年来，自行车销售额增长50％，约有500万人拥有登山越野型自行车。人口不足2000万的荷兰，却拥有自行车1100多万辆，并修建了9000英里的自行车道。
    诚然，自行车无法代替汽车，但可同汽车及其它交通工具并存，在短距离内更可取代汽车。它与西方现代生活的快节奏并不矛盾。所以，自行车在西方国家正日益受到重视。
