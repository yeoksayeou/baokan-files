A high-ranking official of the Khmer People's National Liberation Forces revealed today in Bangkok that the forces are currently continuing their offensive against the Phnom Penh puppet army and the Vietnamese troops hiding in Cambodia's northwest, approaching Battambang and Pailin.

The official, who requested anonymity, said that since early November, intense battles have been taking place in the areas north and west of Pailin, which is located at the intersection of National Highway 5 and National Highway 69. Pailin is an important military activity center for the Phnom Penh puppet army.

The official also mentioned that since the Khmer People's National Liberation Forces captured Baileung on October 22, they have continued to advance along National Highway 10 towards Battambang and have now reached the outskirts of the city.

Battambang is the second-largest city in Cambodia, located 290 kilometers northwest of Phnom Penh. After the fall of Baileung, the Phnom Penh regime imposed martial law in Battambang and deployed heavy troops to defend it.

The official further disclosed that in the past few days, approximately 2,000 Khmer People's National Liberation Forces soldiers have surrounded the strategic town of Sway Teap from the east, west, and north, and have already controlled 70% of the area.

According to a message from Aran, a town on the eastern border of Thailand, the Khmer People's National Liberation Forces announced on the afternoon of November 15 that they had captured Phnom Malai.

The message stated that from the night of November 14 to the morning of November 15, there was continuous artillery fire along the Thai-Cambodian border. In the afternoon of November 15, the Khmer People's National Liberation Forces captured the last stronghold of the Heng Samrin forces on Phnom Malai, 20 kilometers south of Aran, and captured more than 200 Phnom Penh puppet soldiers during the battle.
