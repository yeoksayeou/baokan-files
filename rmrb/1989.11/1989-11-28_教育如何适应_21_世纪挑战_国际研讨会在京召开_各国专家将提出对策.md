An international symposium on education for the 21st century, organized by UNESCO, opened in Beijing today. This is the first time UNESCO has held an international symposium focused on education for the 21st century.

Wan Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.

The symposium was attended by Mr. Paul, the representative of the UNESCO Director-General, Assistant Director-General for Education, Professor Teng Teng, Vice Minister of the State Education Commission and Chairman of the Chinese National Commission for UNESCO, and Professor Boyle, Chairman of the Carnegie Foundation's Teaching Promotion Committee.

Attendees included representatives and observers from more than 20 countries and regions, including Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, China, the German Democratic Republic, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, totaling over 80 people.

At the conference, Vice Minister Teng Teng of the State Education Commission read the opening speech by Vice Premier and Minister of the State Education Commission Li Tieying. Li Tieying pointed out: Education is a forward-looking endeavor. Today's college students, middle school students, and primary school students will be the mainstay of society in the 21st century. The qualities they develop through education now may have a significant impact on the first three or four decades of the 21st century. Whoever can grasp the education of the 21st century will be in a proactive position in the 21st century. The concept of education will be further updated, and education will accompany a person's entire life, becoming an increasingly important concern for the whole society; the structure of education will be more diverse and flexible, forming a network that covers the entire society; education will become a strategic focus for countries to promote economic and social development and to stand among the world's nations; educational exchanges, cooperation, and mutual learning among countries will increase daily and become an indispensable part of the development and reform of education in each country. Li Tieying also elaborated on the achievements of China's education over the past 40 years, pointing out that the achievements we have made are the foundation for moving towards the 21st century. He revealed that the State Council of China is currently organizing the drafting of the outline for China's education development to the year 2000, and that China's education development and reform will also be inspired and guided by this conference.

The representative of the UNESCO Director-General, Assistant Director-General for Education, Mr. Paul, addressed the conference. He said that recently, people have paid more attention to discussing how to redefine educational goals to improve educational quality and help young people prepare for the arrival of the 21st century. I hope that experts will discuss how education should develop so that young people can receive good training and actively and constructively participate in the personal, social, and professional lives of the next century.

The conference is divided into two stages. The first stage is a dialogue between prominent figures from the economic, technological, political, and cultural sectors and educators to discuss the challenges facing education in the coming decades. The second stage is a thematic seminar, focusing on the impact of cultural, ethical, moral issues, scientific and technological exchanges, and vocational development on education, and proposing suggestions to improve the quality of education for policy reference.

    在大会上，国家教委副主任滕藤教授宣读了国务委员、国家教育委员会主任李铁映的开幕词。李铁映指出：教育是面向未来的事业。现在的大学生、中学生、小学生，将是21世纪社会各方面的主力军。他们现在通过接受教育所形成的各方面的素质，可能对21世纪开始三四十年产生重大影响。谁能把握住21世纪的教育，谁就能在21世纪处于主动地位。教育的观念将进一步更新，教育将伴随着一个人的一生，将越来越成为全社会所关注的事情；教育的结构将更加多样、更加灵活，教育将形成一个覆盖全社会的纵横交错的网络；教育将成为各国推进经济和社会发展，以立于世界民族之林的战略重点；各国间教育交流、合作与借鉴与日俱增，并成为各国教育发展与改革不可缺少的一环。李铁映还阐述了我国教育40年来所取得的成就，指出我们已取得的成绩是迈向21世纪的基础。他透露，中国国务院正在组织起草中国教育到2000年的发展纲要，同时，中国的教育发展和改革也将在这次会议上得到借鉴和启示。
    教科文组织总干事代表、教育助理总干事波尔先生在会上致词。他说，最近人们更加重视讨论如何重新确定教育目标，以便提高教育质量，并帮助青年人为21世纪的到来作好准备。我希望专家们来讨论教育应当怎样发展才能使年轻人受到良好的培训，使他们能积极并富有建设性地参与下一个世纪的个人、社会及职业生活。
    会议分两个阶段。第一阶段由经济界、科技界、政治和文化界名人与教育界人士对话，讨论今后几十年教育面临的挑战；第二阶段是专题研讨会，集中讨论文化、伦理、道德问题，科技交流和劳动职业发展对教育的影响，并提出提高教育质量的建议，供决策参考。
