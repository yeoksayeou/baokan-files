Peru held its triennial municipal elections on November 12, with nearly one million citizens participating in the voting to elect the local leadership of 1,774 municipalities, districts, and counties.

In this municipal election, the Democratic Front, composed of the former ruling People's Action Party, the Christian People's Party, and the Free Movement, won 48.5% of the votes nationwide, securing an absolute majority.

In the election for the mayor of Lima, a major upset occurred. Ricardo Belmont, the leader of the previously unknown "Citizen Action Movement," emerged as the clear winner, securing his position as the mayor of Lima.
