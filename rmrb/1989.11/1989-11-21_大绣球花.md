Title: The Great Ball of Brocade Flower
Author: Qin Mu
Date: 1989-11-21
Edition: 8

This is a collection of contemporary essays. Just by looking at the names of over a hundred authors and the titles of their works, one gets a sense of a dazzling array of stars and a riot of colors. Because the best have been selected and refined, the works in this collection appear even more concise. No writer's works are all at the same level; due to different subjects, varying amounts of effort, and differing strengths of emotional resonance, the quality of most writers' works fluctuates within a certain range. The advantage of a selected collection is that readers do not have to search high and low, but can, in a relatively short time, read the best works of a group of writers in one volume, appreciating the high level of a certain genre of works in a particular historical period. Therefore, a well-chosen collection is indeed a great help to a wide range of readers. For writers, it serves as a certain motivation.

I recall that in the past, the People's Literature Publishing House published national essay collections on the occasion of the 10th and 30th anniversaries of the founding of the nation. This volume is likely to have the character of a "40th Anniversary Collection of Essays." It is not as voluminous as previous publications, naturally because the selection is more refined. The literary editors of the People's Literature Publishing House have a keen eye and ear for the literary creation trends across the nation, and they are well-versed in this work. Therefore, the articles in this collection are quite appropriately selected. Although it cannot be said that all outstanding essayists have been included, this lineup indeed already presents a general picture of the forefront of Chinese essayists.

Throughout Chinese history, outstanding works have been selected from an ocean of literature and widely circulated in the form of anthologies, thus gaining widespread influence. The role played by the selectors is no less than that of the authors. The work of the People's Literature Publishing House is a continuation of this fine tradition, truly making a significant contribution.

The articles collected in this book were published between 1949 and 1989, a span of forty years. This period can naturally be called "contemporary," but because it covers a large span, about one-tenth of the writers have already passed away. Therefore, it is not entirely "contemporary." More accurately, this is a collection of representative works of Chinese essays from the past forty years. These forty years have been a period when China entered a new historical stage after liberation, achieving great successes and also traversing a tortuous path; completing a series of magnificent constructions and also facing many new problems; giving rise to a large number of new people of the times and also seeing some dregs surfacing in some corners; having many things to celebrate and also many things to lament. It is an era of "eight thousand miles of clouds and moon," a process of both birth and death. It cannot be depicted with a single color; it should be represented from multiple angles with various brushstrokes to truly allow people to understand its appearance. Essays, being the light cavalry of literature, are a boundless realm, "covering international and domestic major events, social and family trivialities, great waves and tiny objects, one's own experiences, a hint of feeling, a bit of joy and sorrow, a spark of contemplation, past sorrows, today's joys, all can be transferred to paper, offered to readers." (Zhou Libo, "Preface to Selected Essays") Therefore, numerous essay masterpieces, like the myriad petals forming the great ball of brocade flower, and many lenses composing a wide-angle lens, can reflect the overall appearance of the era.

The works in this collection have diverse themes and are richly varied. The depth and richness of the content, and the myriad changes in technique, are an important sign of the continuous progress of China's essay industry. Excellent essays that pour out emotions and express inner voices are widely loved, embodying the laws of literature and the choices of readers. Such a collection can truly let people see the course of China over the past forty years, including the achievements of the recent ten years of reform and opening up. I believe that from any angle, whether it be expanding vision, enjoying beauty, learning techniques, or facilitating research, this collection is of great value to essay lovers, and libraries in particular need to collect such works.

Let us thank the editors for their hard work. On the occasion of the 40th National Day, such a book should indeed have its place on the tribute stage.

　　大绣球花
    秦牧
    这是一部当代散文的选本，单看那一百多家作者的名字和作品篇目，就令人有群星灿烂，色彩纷纭之感。因为拔萃提纯了，集子中的作品就显得更加凝炼。任何作家，他的篇章，都不会全处在同一水平上；由于题材不同，倾注心血多少有异，感情共鸣强弱不一，大量作家的作品水平，都是在一定幅度之间浮动的。选本的好处，就是让读者不必东寻西找，穷搜博访，而能够以较经济的时间，在一卷之间读到一群作家的“顶儿尖儿”之作，领略某个历史阶段某种体裁作品的高水平。因此，精采的选本，对广大读者的确是帮了大忙的。对于作家则起了一定的激励作用。
    我记得：人民文学出版社过去在建国十周年、三十周年的时候，都出版过全国的散文选集。这一本，大概就具有“建国四十周年散文选”的性质了。它所以卷帙没有从前出版的那么浩繁，自然是由于选得更加精粹的缘故。人民文学出版社的文学编辑，眼观四面，耳听八方，对于全国文学界的创作动向，了如指掌，由他们来做这项工作，可以说是驾轻就熟，事半功倍。所以，这部集子的文章，是选得相当恰当的。虽然不能说优秀的散文作者绝对没有遗漏，但这么一个阵容，的确已经展示了中国散文作家前列的一个梗概了。
    中国历代的优秀作品，从浩如烟海的典籍中被挑选出来，以选本的形式广泛流传，因而得到发扬光大的事例，不胜枚举。选家所发挥的作用，丝毫不在作家之下。人民文学出版社的这项活动，是继承了优良传统，真正作出了贡献的。
    本书搜集的文章，发表于1949至1989年这四十年之间，这段期间，称为“当代”自然可以，但是由于它跨度很大，其中作品，约莫有十分之一的作家已经逝世。因此，极其严格地说，它又不完全是“当代”。更确切地说，这是近四十年中国散文的代表之作。这四十年，是解放后中国跨上历史崭新阶段的时期，它既取得了巨大的成就，又走过曲折的道路；它既完成了一系列辉煌的建设，又面临着许多新的难题；它既涌现了大批时代的新人，不少角落里又有沉渣在泛起；它既有许多事情令人欢呼，又有不少事情使人感叹。这是一个“八千里路云和月”的时代，一个方生未死的历程。用单一的色彩是不能描绘出它的梗概的，应该从多侧面以各种的笔墨来表现它，才能够让人们真正理解它的风貌。散文，由于是文学的轻骑，是个海阔天空的领域，“举凡国际国内的大事，社会家庭的细故，掀天之浪，一物之微，自己的一段经历，一丝感触，一撮悲欢，一星冥想，往日的凄惶，今朝的欢快，都可以移于纸上，贡献读者”。（周立波《散文特写选·序言》）因此，众多的散文精品，就像纷繁的花瓣构成了大绣球花，许多的镜片组成了广角镜似的，足以反映整个时代的风貌。
    集子中的作品，题材林林总总，多采多姿。内容的深厚丰富，手法的变化万千，是我国的散文事业不断取得进展的一个重要标志。而倾注感情，抒发心声的优秀散文受到广泛的喜爱，又体现了文学的法则和读者的选择。这么一部选集，是很能够让人看到四十年来中国的历程，包括最近十年改革开放取得的成就的。我想，不论从开拓视野、美的享受、借鉴技巧、便于研究等任何一个角度看，对于散文爱好者，它都是很有价值的，图书馆尤其需要收藏这一类的著作。
    让我们感谢编辑同志们的辛勤劳动。在国庆40周年之际的献礼坛上，这样的书当然应该占有它的一席。
