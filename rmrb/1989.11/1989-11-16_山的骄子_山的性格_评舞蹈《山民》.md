In the landscape of military dance creation, a new dance with a unique style, "Mountain People," has emerged. It is the artistic achievement of veteran dancer Han Feng from the Xinjiang Military Region Song and Dance Troupe, who has long lived in the Pamir Plateau's Tajik region.

The work depicts the moment before the Tajik people, who have lived in the high-altitude, cold mountains for generations, begin to harvest in autumn. The time is at dawn. The dance does not show the bustling scene of labor, nor does it express the joy of a bountiful harvest; if it did, it would be ordinary and similar to what we see in any similar dance works. Instead, it aims to show the endless strength that people can unleash in their struggle against nature; in the harshest of environments, how they overcome the unimaginable tyranny of the wind and the cruelty of the sand, and how they use their sweat to nurture life and build a beautiful home in the cracks of the rocks. This is vividly portrayed in their knife-sharpening movements and the sound of sharpening, their focused gaze to prevent the harvest from being destroyed by the wind and sand, and their rugged dance steps and fierce poses. The tall "sickle" (a large sickle taller than a person) standing on the horizon is also a symbol of strength, even though it never moves throughout the dance.

It is also a charming portrait of the Tajik people: the naive dance movements, the slightly clumsy and exaggerated dance of rubbing and tasting the wheat, the deep and penetrating gaze that seems to pierce through everything, are all vivid artistic depictions of this nation's character, lifestyle, and geographical environment.

Dance, as an art form, can sometimes be mysterious: some works have flashy titles, high concepts, and grand scenes, but after watching them, they leave almost no impression; some works are just a small scene, a seemingly insignificant moment, but they can evoke deep emotions and boundless imagination. The contrast between the two is so great, what is the reason? This is a very complex issue. In short, can we use the famous saying "Mountains are not high because of their height, but because of their spirits; waters are not deep because of their depth, but because of their dragons" to illustrate this? Can the spirits and dragons in the metaphor be seen as the profound connotations of dance, as well as the true and vivid dance images that convey creativity? Is it the boundary that distinguishes between conceptual explanation and artistic creation? The former is merely a pale sermon with a touch of artistic rouge, which should not have appeared on the stage; the latter is the artistic spirit and soul that ignites people's emotions and inspires their imagination? I believe "Mountain People" undoubtedly belongs to the latter category.

    山的骄子  山的性格
    ——评舞蹈《山民》
    赵国政
    在部队舞蹈创作的风景线上，新露出一个别有风格的舞蹈《山民》。它是由新疆军区文工团老舞蹈家韩风长期在帕米尔高原的塔吉克地区生活而酿造出来的艺术成果。
    作品描写的是世世代代聚居在高寒山区的塔吉克人秋收季节动手割麦前的刹那，时间是在晨曦之中。舞蹈不曾展现沸腾的劳动场面，也不事表现丰收后的喜庆心情；如果这样它就会流于一般，流于我们在任何同类舞蹈作品中都能见到的场面和表现方式。它意在表现人与自然的抗争中，所能发挥的用之不竭的力量；在极为严酷的环境中，他们如何战胜着令人难以想象的风的淫威和沙的残暴，如何用汗水在石头缝里浇灌出供人类繁衍生命、建设美好家园的韧性和勇气。这在他们的磨刀动作和磨刀声中，对风和沙凝睛专注、以防丰收的果实毁于一旦的眼神中，以及粗犷的舞步和剽悍的造型中，都表现得比较充分。还有那高耸于地平线上的“刈镰”（一种比人还高的大镰刀）也是力量的象征，尽管自始至终都没有动过它。
    它还是令人神往的塔吉克人的风情画：那憨态可掬的舞姿，那有点笨拙和略带夸张的搓麦、尝麦的舞蹈，那深不可测、似乎要穿透一切的双眸，都是这个民族性格、生活习态和地理环境等等颇具神采的艺术写照。
    舞蹈这种艺术形式，有的时候会让你感到它诡谲莫测：有的作品题目很张扬，设想很高，场面很大，看完后却几乎留不下什么印象；有的作品则只是一个小景，一个很不起眼的瞬间，却能使人牵动出无限深沉的感喟和气象万千的遐想。两者的对比反差是如此之大，道理何在？谈起来这是个很复杂的问题。简而言之，是否可以把“山不在高，有仙则名；水不在深，有龙则灵”这句名言搬过来加以印证？比喻中的仙者、灵者，是否可以视作舞蹈的深邃内涵，以及真实可感、创意传神的舞蹈形象？是它把概念阐释和艺术创造之间区划出一道鲜明的界限？前者只是一个略施艺术朱粉，实则毫无艺术可言，从而本不应该走到舞台上的苍白的说教；而后者才是燃烧人们情感、引发人们灵动的艺术之仙和艺术之灵？我想《山民》无疑是属于后者。
