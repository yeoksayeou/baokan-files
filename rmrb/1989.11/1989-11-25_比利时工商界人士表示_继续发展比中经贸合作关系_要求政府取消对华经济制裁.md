Belgian business leaders have expressed their desire to continue developing Sino-Belgian economic and trade relations and have called on the government to lift economic sanctions against China.

A report from our correspondent in Brussels, Wei Wei, dated November 24:

The Sino-Belgian Economic and Trade Committee and the Antwerp Chamber of Commerce jointly held a seminar titled "China's Economy and Foreign Trade" in the northern Belgian port city of Antwerp. Many Belgian business leaders expressed their willingness to continue efforts to develop Sino-Belgian economic and trade relations and demanded that the Belgian government lift economic sanctions against China.

Belgian business leaders pointed out that China is serious about fulfilling its commitments and adhering to the contracts it signs. They also noted that the European Community's response to the "June 4th" incident was an "emotional reaction."

The chairman of the Antwerp Chamber of Commerce, Dix, introduced the achievements of China's reform and opening-up policy. He believes that China's economic prospects and the future of Sino-Belgian economic and trade cooperation are optimistic.

Li De'erhan, one of the two chairmen of the Belgium-China Economic and Trade Committee, said, "We must consider our relations with China from a long-term perspective. We must have confidence in the future of Sino-Belgian relations."

Chinese Ambassador to Belgium Liu Shan said in his speech that the first high-tech cooperation project between China and Western countries was signed with the Belgian company Bell. He hoped that Belgian business friends and the Chinese side would work together to overcome temporary difficulties in bilateral relations.

The director of the Legal Department of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and vice chairman of the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission, Xiao Zhiming, gave a speech titled "China's Door Remains Open." He pointed out that since the economic adjustment, no foreign-invested enterprise that has been established has been closed, which shows that investing in China is very attractive and competitive. China will continue to improve the investment environment, introduce advanced foreign science and technology, learn from advanced foreign management experience, and firmly follow the path of reform and opening up to strengthen the country.

The mayor of Antwerp, Korse, and more than 60 Belgian business leaders attended the seminar.

　　比利时工商界人士表示
　　继续发展比中经贸合作关系
　　要求政府取消对华经济制裁
    本报布鲁塞尔11月24日电　记者魏崴报道：比中经贸委员会和安特卫普工商会今天在比利时北部港口城市安特卫普联合举办“中国经济和对外贸易”研论会，不少比利时工商界人士表示继续努力发展比中经贸合作关系，并要求比利时政府取消对中国的“经济制裁”。
    比利时工商界人士指出，中国是认真履行自己的承诺的，并且遵守所签订的合同。他们还指出，欧洲共同体对中国“六·四”事件所作出的反应是一种“感情冲动”。
    安特卫普工商会主席迪克斯在会上介绍了他所了解的中国改革开放政策所取得的成就。他认为中国的经济前景和发展比中经贸合作关系的前景是乐观的。
    比利时—中国经济贸易委员会两主席之一李德尔汉在会上说：“我们必须从长远的观点来考虑与中国的关系，我们必须对发展比中关系的前途有信心。”
    中国驻比利时大使刘山在发言中说，中国和西方国家的第一个高技术合作项目，就是与比利时贝尔公司签订的。他希望比利时经贸界朋友和中方共同努力，克服双边关系中碰到的暂时困难。
    中国国际贸促会法律部部长、中国国际经济贸易仲裁委员会副主席萧志明在会上作了题为《中国大门仍然是开着的》发言，他指出，自从经济调整以来，已开办的外商投资企业没有一家因此而停办，说明在中国投资是有很大吸引力和竞争力的。中国将继续改善投资环境，引进国外的先进科学技术，学习国外先进管理经验，坚定不移地沿着改革开放这条强国之路走下去。
    安特卫普市市长科尔斯和60多位比利时工商界人士参加了研讨会。
