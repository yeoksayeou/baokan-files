China's athletes performed below expectations on the first day of the 8th Asian Athletics Championships, securing only 3 gold medals out of the 7 events decided, falling short of the anticipated results.

The Asian record holder in the men's shot put, Ma Yongfeng of China, and his teammate Cheng Shaobo, who were in good form before the competition, managed to throw only 17.63 meters and 17.43 meters respectively today, placing fourth and fifth. The gold medal went to Indian athlete B. Singh with a throw of 18.16 meters.

China's men's high jump athlete Liu Yunpeng, who has a personal best of 2.30 meters, failed three times at the 2.20-meter mark today. Both Liu and South Korea's Cho Hyun-wook cleared 2.17 meters, but since Liu cleared this height on his second attempt, the gold medal went to Cho.

The three gold medals China won were all in women's events. Zhong Huandi easily won the 3000-meter run, Liu Shuzhen dominated the long jump, and Xin Xiaoli and Xu Demei took the gold and silver medals in the javelin throw. However, their performances were far from their personal bests.

Veteran athlete Zhang Guowei was narrowly defeated by North Korea's Ryu Yum-hyon in the final lap of the men's 10,000-meter run, settling for the silver medal. Ryu's time was 29:07.93.

    亚洲田径锦标赛首日角逐
    中国选手表现欠佳
    据新华社新德里11月15日电  （记者黄平）中国选手在第八届亚洲田径锦标赛的首日比赛中表现有失水准，在决出的7个项目中只获3枚金牌，比预计的结果要差。
    男子铅球亚洲纪录保持者、中国的马永峰和队友程少波赛前状态不错，可今天分别只投出了17米63和17米43，分列第四、第五位。印度选手包·辛格以18米16夺走金牌。
    中国男子跳高选手刘云鹏的个人最好成绩是2米30，但今天在2米20的高度上3次失利。他与南朝鲜的赵炫旭都只跳过2米17，但由于刘云鹏是在第二次试跳中跃过这一高度的，结果金牌被赵炫旭夺走。
    中国所获的3枚金牌都是女子项目。钟焕娣在3000米跑中轻松夺标，刘淑珍在跳远中技压群芳，辛小丽、徐德妹包揽标枪的金、银牌，但她们的成绩远未达到个人的最好水平。
    老将张国伟在男子10000米跑的最后一圈中不敌朝鲜民主主义人民共和国选手柳玉铉的有力冲刺，只得到银牌。柳玉铉的成绩是29分07秒93。
