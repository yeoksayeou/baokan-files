In the mist, the professional team's car proudly honks a series of horns and departs, leaving a long plan for prosperity in the modern village.

He stands like a dark iron tower on the warm earth. He says, "I was raised in the bosom of the land." The wafting scent of grain is my tender thoughts. Oh, in that rainy spring, he was nurturing hope under the sun. Now, a fresh and round morning sun is gilding him onto a golden calendar.
