    Striving Under the Blue Sky
    —Advancing Towards World Standards in China's Parachuting Movement

    In early August of this year, at the international parachuting competition held in Indonesia, our country secured 3 out of the 8 championship titles.

    In mid-October, at the fifth World Cup parachuting competition held in Chengdu, our athletes won 4 out of the 12 championship titles. Recently, the president of the International Air Sports Federation, Kaine, awarded the International Air Sports Federation Collective Honor Award to the Anyang Aviation Sports School.

    In the golden autumn of October, we visited the Anyang Aviation Sports School under the State Sports Commission. We invited Principal Zhang Jie and Coach Wang Jianye to introduce the development of parachuting in New China. Zhang Jie said, "From 1955 to 1965, over a span of ten years, our country's parachuting movement had 70 individuals achieving 41 world records in 22 different parachuting events. However, during the Cultural Revolution, our parachuting movement was basically in a state of 'shock.' In early 1979, representatives from our country's Aviation Sports Association first participated in the International Air Sports Federation's parachuting committee meeting held in the Netherlands. From then on, China's parachuting movement officially stepped onto the international stage. Currently, our parachuting achievements have reached the forefront of the international arena. Over the past decade, we have participated in more than 30 major international parachuting competitions, winning 85 championships. The world records for individual parachuting stunts for both men and women are currently held by our country's Zou Jimin and Li Rongrong.

    The chief coach of the national parachuting team, Wang Jianye, said, "The first person to successfully parachute from the sky was the Frenchman Lenoir. In December 1783, he used a parachute made of hemp cloth to jump from the observatory in Saint-Péray, landing successfully on the ground. Parachuting is a sport that combines scientific knowledge and athletic skills. Athletes must have good physical fitness. Parachuting not only trains one's willpower and cultivates a brave and strong character but also cultivates more aviation reserve forces for wartime, earning it the title of the 'sport of the brave.' Therefore, governments of various countries have actively promoted it, making parachuting rapidly develop. In 1951, the International Air Sports Federation was officially established, deciding to include parachuting as a competitive event and to hold the World Parachuting Championships.

    In 1955, our country temporarily selected 7 outstanding parachutists from the airborne troops to participate in the parachuting competition held in Sofia, which included 7 socialist countries. Comrades He Long and Rong Gaotang encouraged the parachutists: 'You must become the seeds of this sport in our country.'

    Thirty-four years have passed, and the 'seeds' of the past have now borne fruitful results. Our country now has more than 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions that have established parachuting teams. Before participating in international competitions each year, outstanding athletes are temporarily gathered at the Anyang Aviation Sports School under the State Sports Commission for training. In the vast training grounds, the 52-year-old Wang Jianye pointed to the parachutists descending gently from the blue sky and white clouds, saying: 'We possess advanced parachuting observation equipment internationally. Every year, parachuting enthusiasts from abroad come to our country's various parachuting grounds to participate in friendly matches. Parachuting has become a bridge connecting our country with people from various countries.'

### 奋斗在蓝天下——向世界水平迈进的中国跳伞运动

    奋斗在蓝天下
    ——向世界水平迈进的中国跳伞运动
    今年8月初，在印尼举行的国际跳伞比赛我国获得8项冠军中的3项冠军。
    10月中旬在成都举行的第五届世界杯跳伞比赛，我国选手又获得12项冠军中的4个冠军。前不久国际航联主席凯恩向安阳航空运动学校颁发了国际航联集体荣誉奖。
    金秋十月，我们来到国家体委安阳航空运动学校，请张杰校长和王建业教练等人介绍新中国的跳伞运动。张杰说，1955年至1965年的十年间，我国飞机跳伞运动曾有70人、41次打破22项世界跳伞运动各项纪录。然而在“文革”中，我国跳伞运动基本处于“休克”状态。1979年初，我国航空运动协会代表首次参加了在荷兰举行的国际航空联合会跳伞委员会会议，自此，中国的跳伞运动才正式步入国际跳伞舞台。目前我国跳伞运动的成绩已达到国际前列。十年来，我们共参加30多场国际大型跳伞比赛，获得了85次冠军。世界跳伞男女个人特技项目的纪录现在由我国邹继民、李荣荣保持着。
    国家跳伞队主教练王建业说，人类第一个真正从空中跳伞成功者是法国人林诺尔，1783年12月，他采用一个用亚麻布做的降落伞，从圣佩利埃数十米高的观象台上跳下，成功降落地面。跳伞运动是一项科学知识和运动技巧相结合的运动，运动员必须具备良好的身体素质。跳伞运动不仅可以锻炼人的意志，培养勇敢坚强的性格，还可以为战时培训出更多的航空后备力量，被称为“勇敢者的运动”。所以各国政府多加倡导，从而使跳伞运动迅速开展起来。1951年正式成立了国际航空运动协会，决定把跳伞作为一个竞赛项目，并决定举行世界跳伞锦标赛。
    1955年，我国临时从伞兵部队中选调了7名优秀跳伞官兵，应邀参加了在索亚非举行的有7个社会主义国家参赛的跳伞运动会。贺龙和荣高棠同志勉励跳伞运动员：你们要成为我国这项运动的种子。
    34年过去了，昔日的“种子”，如今已结出丰硕的果实。我国现在有20多个省、市、自治区建立了跳伞队，每年参加国际比赛前，临时把成绩优异的运动员集中到国家体委安阳航空运动学校进行集训。在一望无垠的广阔训练场地上，52岁的王建业指着纷纷扬扬从蓝天白云中徐徐降落的跳伞健儿说：我们拥有国际上先进的跳伞观察设备，每年都有国外跳伞爱好者到我国各跳伞场地进行友谊赛，跳伞运动已成为沟通我国与各国人民友谊的桥梁。
