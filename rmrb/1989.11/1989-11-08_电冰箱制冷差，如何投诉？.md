	How to Complain About a Refrigerator That Doesn't Cool Properly?

	Question: I bought a refrigerator, but it doesn't cool well at all. The sales unit refuses to exchange or refund it. How should I complain?

		River North County, Hebei Province, Dù Bǎoquán

	Answer: The newspaper forwarded your letter to us, and we will now respond to your question as follows:

	When a consumer's interests are harmed, they can negotiate with the responsible party—the manufacturer or the seller—to demand a reasonable solution according to the regulations. If this does not resolve the issue or is inconvenient, you can directly complain to the Consumer Association. According to the regulations of the "Chinese Consumer Association Charter," one of the tasks of the Consumer Association is to accept consumer complaints about the quality, price, hygiene, and other aspects of goods and services.

	The refrigerator you bought does not cool well, which is a product quality issue from the factory. For convenience, please go to the county Consumer Association to file a complaint. For serious problems, you can also file a lawsuit with the People's Court. When filing a complaint, please clearly state the complainant's name, address, time, the name and address of the party being complained about, and the details of the harm suffered.

    答：报社将你的来信转给我们，现就你的问题答复如下：
    当消费者的利益受到损害时，可与责任者——商品制造单位或经营者进行交涉，要求按规定予以合理解决。如果得不到解决或不方便，可直接向消费者协会投诉。根据《中国消费者协会章程》的规定：消费者协会的任务之一，就是接受消费者对商品和服务在质量、价格、卫生等方面的投诉。
    您买的电冰箱制冷效果极差，属于厂家产品质量问题。为了方便起见，请您到县消费者协会投诉。问题严重的，也可向人民法院依法投诉。投诉时，请把投诉人的姓名、地址、时间、被投诉单位名称、地址及受害的事实详细写明。
