Krenz Discusses Current Situation and Party Tasks at Central Committee Plenum

Party to Better Play Leading Role

	BERLIN, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- German Democratic Republic (GDR) Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) General Secretary Krenz made a lengthy report on the current situation in the GDR and the party's tasks at the 10th Plenum of the 11th Central Committee.

	Krenz pointed out that the GDR is currently in a "tense and contradictory period." To get through this difficult time, the party must first reform itself.

	He stressed that party reform means making the party better able to play a leading role. This "requires us to continuously promote intra-party democracy and ensure consistency between words and deeds," so that the party, as the representative of the people's interests, can have prestige and appeal among the masses. He believes that the party has the ability to reform itself and lead the socialist reform in the GDR.

	Krenz pointed out that the GDR has already begun the process of socialist reform, and to deepen this process, it needs everyone in society to contribute at their own posts. He said that the socialist reform of the GDR will be carried out under the condition of opening up to the world.

	Krenz said that the urgent task of economic reform in the GDR is to "take emergency measures to stabilize the economic situation." This requires a fundamental reform of the existing economic system to establish a vibrant and flexible economic system. He said that the state-owned economy remains the foundation of the socialist economy. The superiority of socialist planned economy should be combined with the regulatory role of the market.

	In discussing the GDR's foreign policy, Krenz pointed out that it is necessary to further strengthen relations with the Soviet Union and the Socialist Commonwealth, while emphasizing the development of friendly neighborly relations with Czechoslovakia and Poland. He expressed that the GDR will closely maintain exchanges with the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) and the Warsaw Pact, and seriously fulfill treaty obligations.

	Regarding the relationship between the GDR and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), Krenz reiterated that the two Germanys are mutually independent sovereign states. The GDR is willing to develop bilateral relations on the basis of the Basic Treaty and the Bonn Communiqué of September 1987.

    克伦茨在中央全会上阐述当前形势和党的任务
    党要更好地发挥领导作用
    新华社柏林11月8日电  德国统一社会党中央总书记克伦茨8日在11届10中全会上就民主德国当前形势和党的任务作了长篇报告。
    克伦茨指出，民主德国目前正处在一个“紧张并充满矛盾的时期”。为渡过艰难时期，首先要对党的自身进行改革。
    他强调指出，党的改革意味着要使党能够更好地发挥领导作用。这就“要求我们从现在起不断地发扬党内民主，保证言行一致”，使党作为人民利益的代表在群众中享有威信，具有号召力。他认为，党有能力进行自身改革，并能领导民主德国的社会主义改革。
    克伦茨指出，“民主德国已经开始了社会主义改革进程”，为把这一进程推向深入，它需要社会上每个人在自己的岗位上作出贡献。他说，民主德国的社会主义改革将要在向世界开放的条件下进行。
    克伦茨说，民主德国经济改革的当务之急是“采取紧急措施来稳定经济形势”。这就需要对现行的经济体制进行根本改革，以建立生机勃勃、灵活的经济体制。他说，国营经济依然是社会主义经济的基础。要把社会主义计划经济的优越性同市场的调节作用结合起来。
    在谈到民主德国的外交政策时，克伦茨指出，要进一步加强同苏共和苏联的关系，同时强调进一步发展同捷、波的睦邻友好关系。他表示，民主德国将密切同经互会和华约的往来，认真履行条约义务。
    关于民主德国同联邦德国的关系，克伦茨重申，两个德国是相互独立的主权国家，民主德国愿意在两德关系基础条约和1987年9月波恩公报的基础上来发展双边关系。
