The Beira Corridor, this transportation network, is crucial for the economic development of the southern African countries. It is not only the main artery of Mozambique's economic development but also an important channel for the import and export of goods for its neighboring countries. The current situation of the Beira Corridor is another issue of concern for the reporter during his visit to Africa.

In the capital of Zimbabwe, Harare, the reporter visited Norman, the head of the Beira Corridor International Committee. In a small, serene building, he met with us.

Pointing to the map, Mr. Norman first indicated that there are two traditional channels for the import and export of goods in the southern African region: one is through South Africa and its ports; the other is via the Beira Corridor through Mozambique's Beira Port. Since the 1970s, when most southern African countries gained independence, to break away from dependence on South Africa and oppose its control, most southern African countries have primarily used the Beira Corridor for their import and export of goods.

The Beira Corridor not only includes the Beira Port, the railway lines from Beira to Zimbabwe and Malawi, and the road system from Beira to the central provinces of Mozambique and the neighboring countries of Zambia and Malawi; it also includes the aviation system, oil pipelines, and telecommunications equipment in this region. Beira Port is the most convenient seaport for these countries. It serves not only Mozambique but also the neighboring countries of Zimbabwe, Botswana, Malawi, and Zambia, and even the Shaba province of Zaire, becoming an important channel for the import and export of goods for these countries. For example, 43% of Zimbabwe's economic income comes from exports, 65% of Zambia's and over 70% of Malawi's income comes from foreign trade, and Botswana's economy also mainly relies on foreign trade. The most efficient route for the export of goods for these countries is the Beira Corridor; otherwise, they would be subject to the control of South African ports. Therefore, for some countries in the southern African region, the Beira Corridor has important economic and strategic significance.

During the conversation, Mr. Norman angrily pointed out that South Africa, to force these countries to be economically dependent on it, not only supports the anti-government armed forces of countries like Mozambique to harass the Beira Corridor but also frequently sends armed forces to cause trouble directly. The most serious incident was at the end of 1983, when it sent a commando unit to land from the sea and attack oil depots and bridges, causing $70 million in damage to the Beira Corridor; it destroyed the navigational aids, making the Beira Port, which has an annual throughput of 400 to 500 million tons, unusable. The South African army also infiltrated Mozambique, destroying six railways in the Limpopo River area. By 1984, all railways leading to Mozambique had been destroyed, and the Beira Corridor was in a state of paralysis. Zimbabwe had to export 75% of its goods through South Africa, incurring 80% more transportation costs; Malawi could not use the Beira Port, only 600 kilometers away, to transport goods but had to take a detour of about 3000 kilometers through South African ports, paying four to five times more in transportation costs; other countries also increased their burden by about 25%; Mozambique suffered even greater losses.

The grim reality made people realize that defending and repairing the Beira Corridor is not only an urgent task for Mozambique but also a common responsibility for the southern African countries. Since then, countries like Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Tanzania have sent troops to protect the Beira Corridor transportation lines. In 1986, the Beira Corridor International Committee was established, formulating a five-year plan from 1986 to 1991 to restore and improve the transportation capacity of the Beira Corridor at a cost of $370 million. The United Kingdom, France, Canada, Portugal, and the Soviet Union participated in the construction of several important railway lines in Mozambique; Italy and the Netherlands helped repair the Beira Port. Currently, the engineering projects are proceeding smoothly, and the oil pipelines and railway lines have been basically repaired. The railway from Limpopo to Maputo was put into operation in February this year... At this point, Mr. Norman's face showed a mix of joy and worry.

His concerns are understandable. Beira Port is an important part of the Beira Corridor, and its repair and operation situation have a significant impact on the transportation business of the Beira Corridor. Therefore, the reporter decided to go to Beira Port. Upon arriving at Beira Port, the reporter was pleased to see that the repair work was in full swing, and the cargo handling operations were quite busy. Thirty-two tower cranes were constantly swinging their giant arms, loading and unloading sisal and fertilizer; a train loaded with quartz was parked in the port area for unloading, ready for sea transport to India; on the oil-dedicated wharf, one oil tanker after another was being refueled, with one of them about to set sail for Harare; the partially dilapidated roads and wharves in some port areas were under construction and repair. Beira Port presented a bustling scene...

Pedro, the manager of Beira Port, hurried to meet the reporter right after a meeting. He is 62 years old and has worked in the port area for 45 years. During the Portuguese colonial rule, he was an ordinary warehouse manager. After independence, he grew into the top leader of the port area through hard work. From his weather-beaten face, one could see that he is an experienced and practical person. He gave the reporter a comprehensive introduction to the port area: Beira Port has 11 wharves, 10 of which need to be repaired; 5 new container wharves and a large container warehouse need to be built; in addition, the wharf facilities need to be updated, and the river channels need to be dredged and expanded. So far, 50% of the work needs to be completed in the next two to three years. After the completion of all the projects, the port can accommodate 60,000-ton ships and can hold 100,000 containers. Mr. Pedro excitedly told us:

"Despite the difficulties encountered while repairing and transporting, the maritime business and management level have improved compared to previous years. Now, ships from the Soviet Union, the United States, Greece, India, and China come in and out of Beira Port. The cargo ship that China purchases tobacco from Zimbabwe sets sail from Beira Port." Then, pointing to the statistical table on the table, he said: "The transportation volume of containers and bulk cargo from countries like Malawi, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Zambia has increased compared to before, and the port's throughput has also increased year by year, reaching 20 million tons in 1987, 23 million tons in 1988, and it is expected to reach 25 million tons this year."

The situation at Beira Port is gratifying. When bidding farewell, Mr. Pedro said in a confident tone: "In two or three years, Beira Port will undergo greater changes, and we welcome you to come and see it again..." Indeed, this visit made us believe that Beira Port will soon appear in a new guise on the shores of the Indian Ocean.

    贝拉走廊纪行
    本报记者　徐德文
    贝拉走廊，这一运输网络，对于南部非洲国家的经济发展至关重要。它不仅是莫桑比克经济发展的大动脉，也是其周围邻国进出口商品的重要通道。贝拉走廊近况如何，是记者在非洲采访时所关心的又一个问题。
    在津巴布韦首都哈拉雷，记者走访了贝拉走廊国际委员会负责人诺曼先生。在一栋环境幽雅的小楼里，他会见了我们。
    对着地图，诺曼先生首先指出，南部非洲地区进出口物资有两条传统通道：一条是通过南非及其港口；另一条是沿贝拉走廊经莫桑比克的贝拉港出口。自70年代南部非洲国家纷纷取得独立后，为了摆脱对南非的依赖和反对南非的控制，大部分南部非洲国家进出口物资主要是通过贝拉走廊。
    贝拉走廊不仅包括贝拉港、贝拉至津巴布韦和马拉维的铁路线，以及从贝拉通往莫桑比克中部各省和邻国赞比亚与马拉维的公路系统；还包括这个地区的民航系统、输油管道和电讯设备。贝拉港是这些国家最便捷的出海口。它不仅服务于莫桑比克，也服务于近邻津巴布韦、博茨瓦纳、马拉维和赞比亚，甚至扎伊尔的沙巴省，成为这些国家的进出口商品的重要通道。例如，津巴布韦经济来源的43％靠出口，赞比亚65％和马拉维70％以上的收入来自外贸，博茨瓦纳的经济也主要靠外贸。这些国家出口商品效益最佳的通途是贝拉走廊，否则就得受制于南非的港口。因此，对南部非洲地区一些国家来说，贝拉走廊具有重要的经济和战略意义。
    言谈间，诺曼先生愤然指出，南非为了迫使这些国家在经济上依赖于它，除支持莫桑比克等国的反政府武装对贝拉走廊进行骚扰外，它还经常直接出动武装进行捣乱，尤以1983年底的破坏活动最为严重，它派遣一股突击队从海上登陆，袭击油库和桥梁，给贝拉走廊造成7000万美元的损失；破坏了航标，使年吞吐量400至500万吨的贝拉港无法使用。南非军队还潜入莫桑比克，毁坏林波波河地区的6条铁路。至1984年，所有通往莫桑比克的铁路都被破坏了，贝拉走廊陷于瘫痪状态。津巴布韦75％的物资不得不通过南非出口，多耗费了80％的运费；马拉维不能用只距600公里的贝拉港运输物资，而被迫绕道约3000公里经南非的港口出口，付出多四五倍的运费；其它一些国家也增加了约25％的负担；莫桑比克遭受的损失更大。
    严峻的现实使人们认识到，保卫和修复贝拉走廊不仅是莫桑比克的当务之急，也是南部非洲国家的共同任务。自此，津巴布韦、马拉维和坦桑尼亚等国派出军队，保卫贝拉走廊运输线。1986年，贝拉走廊国际委员会成立，制定了1986—1991年耗资3.7亿美元的恢复和提高贝拉走廊运输能力的5年计划。英、法、加拿大、葡萄牙和苏联等国参加莫桑比克几条重要铁路线的修建项目；意大利、荷兰帮助修复贝拉港。目前工程项目正在顺利进行中，输油管道和铁路线已基本修复，今年2月林波波河到马普托的铁路已通车……说到这里，诺曼先生脸上流露出喜忧参半的神色。
    他的担忧是可以理解的。贝拉港是贝拉走廊的重要组成部分，它的修复和运转情况对贝拉走廊的运输业务有着重大影响。因此，记者决定到贝拉港去。来到贝拉港现场，记者高兴地看到，修复工程正在热火朝天地进行，吞吐物资的作业也相当忙碌。32座塔式大吊车正在不断地挥动巨臂，装卸剑麻和化肥；满载石英的火车正停在港区卸货，准备海运到印度；石油专用码头上，一艘艘大油轮正在灌油，其中一艘即将起锚开往哈拉雷；年久失修的部分港区的马路和码头正在施工重修。贝拉港，呈现一派繁忙的景象……
    贝拉港经理彼得罗先生，刚开完会就急忙跑来会见记者。他今年62岁了，在港区已工作了45年。葡萄牙殖民统治期间，他是一个普通的仓库管理员，独立后，他在努力工作中成长为港区的第一把手。从他饱经风霜的脸上，看得出这是一位经验丰富的实干家。他向记者全面介绍港区的情况：贝拉港共有11个码头，有10个需要重修；还要新建5个集装箱码头和一个集装箱大仓库；此外还要更新码头设施，疏浚、扩展河道。至今尚有50％的工程要在两三年内完成。全部工程完成后，港口可停靠6万吨级的轮船，可容10万只集装箱。彼得罗先生还兴奋地告诉我们：
  “尽管边修港，边运输，遇到很多困难，但如今海运业务和管理水平均比前几年提高了。现在进出贝拉港的有苏联、美国、希腊、印度和中国等船只，中国向津巴布韦购买烟草的运货船就是从贝拉港启航的。接着，他指着桌上的统计表说：马拉维、津巴布韦、博茨瓦纳、赞比亚等国的集装箱和散装货物的运输量均比以前有所增加，港口吞吐量也逐年提高，1987年为200万吨，1988年为230万吨，预计今年可达250万吨。
    贝拉港的状况是令人欣慰的。告别时，彼得罗先生以充满自信的语调说：“再过两三年，贝拉港的面貌会有更大的变化，那时欢迎你们再来看看……”是的，这次参观使我们相信，贝拉港在不久之后将会以崭新的面貌出现在印度洋畔。
