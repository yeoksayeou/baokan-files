    One of the 500 largest enterprises in the country, the Shanxi Luan Coal Mine Bureau, has in recent years achieved 25 "national firsts" in a miraculous manner, breaking several world records and being hailed by peers as the "most concentrated enterprise in the nation."

    The Wangzhuang Coal Mine's comprehensive mechanized mining team at this bureau has an annual coal production of 17 million tons, breaking the world record of 16.54 million tons set by the Soviet Union's Potapov comprehensive mechanized mining team. The Zhangcun Coal Mine has had no fatal accidents since June 15, 1985, a safety production record unmatched by any large mine in the world.

    The "national bests" created by the people of Luan also include coal mining mechanization, output and tax rate, capital tax rate, per capita tax creation, and enterprise management level, which are the main economic and technical indicators of the coal industry.

    潞安矿创25项“全国第一”
    据新华社北京11月21日电　（记者赵明亮）全国500家大型企业之一的山西潞安矿务局，近年来奇迹般地创造了25项“全国第一”，并打破几项世界纪录，被同行誉为“全国之最密集型企业”。
    这个矿务局的王庄煤矿综采一队年采煤量达170万吨，打破了苏联波塔波夫综采队创造的年产165.4万吨的世界纪录。漳村煤矿自1985年6月15日以来至今未发生死亡事故，世界上还没有一个大型矿井有如此之长的安全生产纪录。
    潞安人创造的“全国之最”还有采煤机械化、产值利税率、资金利税率、人均创利税和企业管理水平等煤炭工业的主要经济技术指标。
