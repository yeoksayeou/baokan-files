Title: More Than Just the Peony as a Matchmaker

Recently, I traveled to Henan and had the fortune to attend the Luoyang Peony Festival. In the garden, each blossom of the "national flower of China" stood out, surpassing all others, giving me a feast for the eyes. What added to the enjoyment was the sight of novel commercial advertisements among the flowers, inviting visitors to rest and browse through a variety of products. There were also technology exchange meetings and trade order meetings, presenting a unique scene where people, peonies, and products all shone brightly. While enjoying the flowers, I also learned about many new products and technologies, truly appreciating this new type of flower festival that combines multiple benefits. It is said that some industrial and commercial enterprises are even more grateful for this kind of festival. In recent years, Luoyang has held such economic-type flower festivals that combine flowers and products, with annual transaction volumes ranging from 900 million to 1.3 billion yuan. This has helped many enterprises to prosper by exchanging goods through the festival. As the saying goes: "The peony of Luoyang now acts as a matchmaker, combining flower appreciation with commerce."

Upon returning, I reflected on this and recalled the kite festival in Weifang, Shandong, the dragon boat races on the Xiangjiang and Yueyang rivers, the ice lantern festival in Harbin, the tidal bore viewing on the Qiantang River, as well as various sports events, cultural performances, and advertisements interspersed in radio, television, and newspapers. All these have been exploring ways to use cultural and sports activities as a medium to promote the integration with socialist commodity economy. It seems that matchmaking is not just the role of the peony. The people of China in the 1980s have been using modern communication theories to change the single-information self-propagation of the past, transforming it into a multi-information three-dimensional propagation, becoming a "matchmaker" that helps commodities find more partners.

In China's long history, people only knew of matchmaking for romantic love. Talented scholars and beautiful women often used poetry, paintings, or flowers as tokens of affection.

Now, China's commodity economy, with a history of several thousand years, has embarked on a new and broad path of socialism. Old concepts are changing. But I think the new concept of socialist commodities still needs to be popularized. Today, there are still many lantern festivals, song festivals, dragon boat races, and other events that remain pure, having only lanterns, songs, or dragon boats. There is "something to see but nothing to sell." They dare not combine with economic information, which is almost a great waste. I believe that those flower festivals, lantern festivals, song festivals, dragon boat festivals, and many mass media tools are like the waters of the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River. If you combine them with socialist commodity economic activities, it is like building the Gezhouba Dam on the Yangtze River. Otherwise, you will let the water that can generate electricity flow away uselessly. If we can utilize all these activities that can act as media to become carriers of multi-information about the economy and technology, what kind of economic vitality and social benefits will it bring!

May the effect of achieving multiple goals with half the effort bloom across the country. Matchmaking is more than just the peony!

    为媒岂止牡丹花
    王映明
    前些时，我出差到河南，幸逢洛阳牡丹花会。园中一朵朵“国色天香”，艳冠群芳，让我大饱眼福。尤其添人兴致的是，鲜花丛中，时见有新奇的商品广告牌向游人问好，琳琅满目的产品展销会请客人小憩，还有技术洽谈会、贸易订货会，处处呈现一派人面、牡丹、商品相映红的别致情趣。我在赏花怡情之时，顺便获悉了不少新商品、新技术知识，实在感谢这种一箭双雕的新型花会。据说，一些工商企业对这种花会更为感激不已。因为近几年，洛阳办这种花卉与商品杂交共生的经济型花会，每年的商品成交额在9亿元至13亿元之间，使得好些企业借花会互通有无而繁荣兴旺起来。人道是：洛阳牡丹今为媒，赏花从商两相随。
    归来细想，又忆及山东潍坊的风筝盛会、湘江和岳阳的龙舟竞渡、哈尔滨的冰灯会、钱塘江的观潮，还有许多体育赛场、文艺演厅，以及广播、电视、报刊中穿插的广告，都已在探索以文化体育活动为媒介推进与社会主义商品经济结合的门道。看来，为媒何止牡丹花？80年代的炎黄子孙，已经在运用现代传播学改变以往的单信息量自我传播，使之形成多元信息的立体传播，成为让商品找到更多婆家的“媒人”。
    在中国漫长历史中，人们只知道为儿女情长而做媒。才子佳人遇合，每每以题诗作画为媒介，或赠花作信物的。
    如今，中国几千年来商品经济踏上了社会主义的崭新广阔之路。陈旧的观念正在变。但我想社会主义商品新观念又还有待普及。今日还有许多灯会、歌会、赛龙舟等，依然是那样洁身自好，只有灯，只有歌，只有龙舟。这里是“有看的，没有卖的”。不敢和经济信息相结合，几乎是一种极大的浪费。我以为，那些花会、灯会、歌会、龙舟会乃至许多大众传播工具，就好像是长江三峡之水，你把它和社会主义商品经济活动结合起来办，就好比是在长江上修起了葛洲坝。否则，就白白让可发电的水流失了。假如我们把那么多的能起媒介作用的活动都利用起来，成为传播经济、科技的多元信息载体，那将会带来怎样的经济活力和社会效益啊！
    愿一石数鸟、事半功倍的效应在神州遍地开花。为媒岂止牡丹花！
