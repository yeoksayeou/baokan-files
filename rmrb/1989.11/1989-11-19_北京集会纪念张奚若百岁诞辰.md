A commemoration for the 100th anniversary of the birth of renowned non-partisan patriotic democrat, educator, and legal scholar Zhang Ziyi was held today at Tsinghua University. Li Xiannian and Peng Zhen wrote inscriptions to commemorate Zhang Ziyi's 100th birthday, and Hu Qiuming, Zhou Peiyuan, and Fei Xiaotong attended the commemoration.

Zhang Ziyi participated in the Tongmenghui in his early years and engaged in revolutionary activities to overthrow the imperial system in Shanghai. He served as a professor at Central University, Tsinghua University, and Southwest Associated University. During the War of Resistance, he actively participated in the patriotic democratic movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. In 1949, he represented non-partisan democrats at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and was elected as a member of the Standing Committee. He held various positions, including member of the Central People's Government, vice chairman of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the State Council, Minister of Education, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and Director of the State Council's Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee. He was a representative of the First, Second, and Third National People's Congresses and a Standing Committee member of the First, Second, Third, and Fourth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He passed away in Beijing in 1973.

Notable scholars Chen Dishan, Li Funing, Zhang Guohua, Hu Qiuming, and Cui Yeli recalled Zhang Ziyi's dedication as a patriotic intellectual striving for the rejuvenation of China, as well as his upright character and courage to speak out for justice. Zhang Ziyi's eldest son, Zhang Wenpo, who is currently the Chinese Ambassador to Canada, also attended the commemoration and spoke.
