Deng Xiaoping Visits Nyerere
Two Old Friends Have a Warm Conversation

Beijing, November 23 (Reported by Sun Yi) — This morning, Comrade Deng Xiaoping specially came to the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse to visit the Chairman of the Southern Commission and Chairman of the Tanzanian Revolutionary Party, Nyerere. This is the first time Deng Xiaoping has visited a guest's residence since he retired from political life.

In the hall of Building 18 at the state guesthouse where Chairman Nyerere is staying, when Nyerere saw Deng Xiaoping walking over briskly, he walked forward to greet this old friend with a warm handshake and embrace.

Nyerere said, "It's great to see you again."

Deng Xiaoping said, "We are old friends, and I should come to see you and visit you."

"You look very healthy!"

Deng Xiaoping humorously said, "No major illnesses, but minor ones keep coming up. After all, I am 85 years old. I have already retired, and maybe retirement will give me a few more years."

Deng Xiaoping continued, "I came to see you to visit an old friend and talk about our friendship, but we won't discuss politics. When you come again in the future, I will still visit you, and we should often talk about our friendship."

Nyerere said, "You are very healthy, and we will see each other often."

Subsequently, the two old friends had a very warm and friendly conversation in a very cordial atmosphere.

　　邓小平看望尼雷尔
　　两位老朋友亲切交谈
    本报北京11月23日讯　记者孙毅报道：今天上午，邓小平同志特意来到钓鱼台国宾馆，看望南方委员会主席、坦桑尼亚革命党主席尼雷尔。这是邓小平告别政治生涯之后第一次到客人住地进行的拜访活动。
    在国宾馆尼雷尔主席下榻的18号楼大厅里，当尼雷尔看到邓小平健步走过来时，迎上前去同这位老朋友亲切握手、拥抱。
    尼雷尔说，“再次见到您非常高兴。”
    邓小平说，“我们是老朋友了，应该来看看你，拜访你。”
    “看起来您身体还很好啊！”
    邓小平风趣地说，“没有大毛病，但小毛病不断，毕竟85岁了。我已经退休了，也许退休后能给我带来多活几年的好处。”
    邓小平接着说，我来看望你，是为了看看老朋友，叙叙友情，但不谈政治。你以后再来，我还会看望你的，我们要常叙友情。
    尼雷尔说，您身体很健康，我们还会经常见面的。
    随后，两位老朋友在十分亲切友好的气氛中进行了交谈。（附图片）
