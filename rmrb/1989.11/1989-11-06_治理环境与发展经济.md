    Managing the Environment and Developing the Economy
    By People's Daily reporter Zhang Liang

    How to view and handle the relationship between "managing the environment and developing the economy" has become a major issue widely discussed and highly valued in the international community. Recently, the 44th annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank also showed that governments around the world unanimously agree that the deterioration of the global environment seriously threatens the long-term stable development of the world economy and even the survival of humanity. Therefore, managing the environment is a serious and urgent historical task facing humanity.

    In recent years, the extent of global environmental deterioration is shocking. According to a recent World Bank report on environmental issues, every year 11 million hectares of forests are destroyed worldwide. If this trend continues, most of Asia's forests may disappear in the next century. Due to soil erosion, 20 million hectares of arable land are lost each year. Severe water shortages and pollution claim 25,000 lives annually. In the next 20 years, one-fifth of the world's flora and fauna may become extinct. The greenhouse effect is causing global warming, urban air pollution is severe, and acid rain is spreading widely. Additionally, some developed countries dump industrial waste, including toxic waste, into developing countries and even attempt to transfer their nuclear waste to developing countries.

    The factors causing global environmental deterioration are multifaceted. The root cause of environmental deterioration in developing countries is poverty, as poverty forces people to overuse natural resources. For example, many developing countries, in order to address urgent needs for fuel, food, and housing, often indiscriminately cut down forests. However, the destruction of forests disrupts the ecological balance, leading to soil erosion and a series of other problems, which in turn hinder agricultural development and exacerbate hunger issues. Coupled with rapid population growth, natural resources are facing increasing pressure.

    However, developed countries bear the primary responsibility for the severe global environmental pollution. The extensive consumption of mineral fuels has caused transboundary acid rain over large areas, acidifying the soil, corroding buildings, and affecting the growth of plants and animals and human health. More seriously, the greenhouse effect is causing global warming. Scientists predict that by the mid-21st century, global temperatures will rise by 4 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit. They also believe that warming will cause sea levels to rise, destroying coastal structures and freshwater salinity, leading to severe storms, monsoons, droughts, floods, and other natural disasters. Most of the gases causing the greenhouse effect are emitted by developed countries, with one-quarter coming from the United States.

    Many countries are increasingly recognizing that while developing the economy, the environment must be managed. As the economy develops, developing countries' ability to manage the environment will naturally improve. If natural resources continue to be overused, the environment polluted, and the ecological balance disrupted, the consequences will inevitably be stunted economic development and serious threats to the survival of all humanity. Therefore, managing the environment is urgent. Many enlightened individuals in the international community believe that managing the environment is a common task for all countries. For developing countries, in addition to their own efforts, the international community should help them quickly overcome poverty and provide financial and technological support for environmental management. Developed countries, in turn, should bear the primary responsibility. Undoubtedly, only through close international cooperation can humanity achieve the dual goals of managing the environment and developing the economy.

    治理环境与发展经济
    本报记者　张亮
    如何看待和处理“治理环境与发展经济”两者之间的关系，已成为当前国际社会广为议论和高度重视的一个重大问题。不久前举行的国际货币基金组织和世界银行第44届年会也表明，各国政府一致认为，全球环境恶化严重威胁着世界经济的长期稳定发展以致整个人类的生存，因而治理环境是人类面临的一个严峻而紧迫的历史任务。
    近年来，全球环境恶化程度之深令人震惊。根据世界银行新近发表的关于环境问题的专题报告，全世界每年有1100万公顷森林遭到毁灭，如照此速度发展下去，下个世纪亚洲的大部分森林可能会消失；由于土壤流失，每年减少2000万公顷耕地；严重缺水和水污染每年夺去2.5万人的生命；在20年内可能有1／5的动植物在地球上绝迹；温室效应导致全球性气温变暖，城市空气污染严重以及酸雨大面积扩散等等。此外，有的发达国家还向发展中国家倾倒包括有毒废料在内的工业垃圾，甚至还试图将其核废料转嫁给发展中国家。
    造成全球环境恶化的因素是多方面的。发展中国家环境恶化的根源在于贫困，因为贫困迫使人们滥用自然资源。譬如，许多发展中国家，为了解决燃料、粮食和住房等燃眉之急，往往任意砍伐森林。但是森林的毁灭又破坏了生态平衡，造成水土流失等一系列问题，进而阻碍农业发展，加剧饥饿问题。加之人口急剧膨胀，给自然资源形成了越来越大的压力。
    但是，发达国家对造成全球环境严重污染负有主要责任。大量消耗矿物燃料造成了跨越国界的大面积酸雨，使土壤酸化，腐蚀建筑物，影响了动植物的生长和人体健康。更为严重的是，温室效应导致全球性气温变暖。据科学家们预测，到下个世纪中期，全球气温将普遍升高华氏4至9度。他们还认为，气温变暖会造成水位升高，破坏海岸结构和淡水的咸度，导致强烈风暴、季风、干旱、洪水等自然灾害。造成温室效应的废气大多出自发达国家，其中1／4是美国排放的。
    许多国家日益认识到，在发展经济的同时必须治理环境。随着经济的发展，发展中国家治理环境的能力自然会不断提高。如果继续滥用自然资源、污染环境和破坏生态平衡，其后果必然是经济发展受挫并严重危害整个人类的生存。因此，治理环境已刻不容缓。国际上众多的有识之士认为，治理环境是世界各国的共同任务。就发展中国家来说，除自身的积极努力外，国际社会应帮助它们尽快摆脱贫困，同时在治理环境方面给以资金和技术支持，而发达国家则理应承担主要责任。毫无疑问，只有国际间的密切合作，人类才能实现既治理好环境又能发展经济的双重目标。
