Premier Li Peng Inspects North and South of Tian Shan, Emphasizes Ethnic Unity and Economic Development
First, a Stable Political Situation is Needed to Advance All Undertakings

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, November 27 (Reporters He Ping, Wang Youfu) — Recently, during his inspection of Xinjiang, Li Peng, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Premier of the State Council, repeatedly emphasized that to advance all undertakings, a stable political situation is essential. He pointed out that for Xinjiang, the top priority is to strengthen ethnic unity, and the foundation of ethnic unity is economic development. Only with economic development can all ethnic groups prosper together.

After successfully concluding his official friendly visit to three South Asian countries, Premier Li Peng, despite his fatigue, traveled day and night from November 21 to 26 to inspect Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, located in the northwestern frontier of the motherland. He brought the care and greetings of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to the people of all ethnic groups here. Premier Li Peng and his entourage were enthusiastically welcomed by the masses in various places.

Among all provinces and autonomous regions in China, Xinjiang is the largest in area. Over the past few days, Premier Li Peng traversed the Tian Shan Mountains, covering thousands of kilometers, and successively inspected the autonomous region's capital Urumqi, the city of Yining in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture near the Sino-Soviet border, one of China's earliest oil bases, the Klamayi Oil Field, the Shihezi Reclamation Area of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and the ancient Silk Road city of Kashgar in southern Xinjiang. He visited villages, factories, oil fields, and military units, and investigated and understood the situation regarding industrial and agricultural production, oil field development, railway construction, foreign trade, border defense, and ethnic unity. Before leaving Urumqi, Premier Li Peng also met with ethnic minority leaders from the Party, government, and military, listened to the work report of the Autonomous Region Party Committee and the People's Government, and delivered an important speech.

Accompanying Premier Li Peng on the inspection were: Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the PLA He Qizong, and General Manager of the China National Petroleum Corporation Wang Tao, among others.

National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Vice Chairman and Chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Advisory Committee Wang Enmao, Autonomous Region Party Committee Secretary Song Hanliang, Autonomous Region Party Committee Deputy Secretary and Chairman Tiemuer Dawameti, Autonomous Region Party Committee Deputy Secretary Jianabulai, and Commander of the Xinjiang Military Region Gao Huanchang, among others, accompanied Premier Li Peng on the inspection.

At the meeting of three thousand cadres in Xinjiang held on November 26, Premier Li Peng discussed international and domestic situations, expounded on the Party and government's domestic and foreign policies, and conveyed the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee to the cadres of all ethnic groups. He also provided guiding opinions on Xinjiang's future work.

Li Peng pointed out that implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session mainly involves solving five issues. First, through further rectification and deepening of reforms, efforts must be made to achieve long-term, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy, which is the guiding principle that must be adhered to in economic construction. Second, the relationship between rectification and reform and opening up must be properly handled, and the two must be organically combined. The principle of combining planned economy with market regulation must be adhered to. Third, the entire Party must pay attention to agriculture and strengthen the foundation of agriculture. Fourth, controlling inflation must be the central task of rectification, efforts must be made to ease the contradiction between total demand exceeding total supply, and inflation must be gradually reduced. Fifth, the current situation where some products have a "buyer's market" must be seized upon to adjust the industrial structure, improve economic efficiency, and turn negative factors into positive ones.

During the inspection, Premier Li Peng saw that the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang were united and harmonious, living in peace, with economic development and border defense consolidation, and he was very pleased. He pointed out that Xinjiang is rich in resources and has a relatively small population, fertile land, and abundant sunlight, providing favorable conditions for the development of large-scale agriculture. The underground mineral resources such as oil and coal are also very rich, with a broad development prospect. He hoped that through the joint efforts of all ethnic groups, Xinjiang would be built into an important commodity base for agricultural products for the country, providing more grain, cotton, and sugar to the country; actively developing resources to provide more oil and other mineral products to the country.

During the inspection, Premier Li Peng repeatedly emphasized the importance of strengthening agriculture. He pointed out that economic development requires a foundation in agriculture. The agricultural issue has always been the most important issue in China. Our 11 billion people need to eat, and we can only rely on our own strength to solve this problem. This issue has increasingly been recognized and emphasized by the entire Party.

During the inspection of the Ili Valley and Kashgar villages, Premier Li Peng learned that since the rural reforms, the villages here have combined local realities, while actively and steadily promoting the household contract responsibility system, have consistently adhered to the "five unifications": unified planting plan, unified mechanized cultivation and irrigation, unified plant protection and epidemic prevention, unified major technical measures, and unified agricultural land construction, and unified establishment of various public welfare undertakings. This has not only mobilized the enthusiasm of farmers for production but also ensured the scale operation of agriculture. Premier Li Peng affirmed this practice, saying that the household contract responsibility system in rural areas must be stable, and it cannot be unstable. However, the fundamental way out for agricultural development lies in relying on science and technology. In places with conditions, and under the voluntary conditions of farmers, actively and steadily promoting appropriate scale operations, establishing and improving the service system before and after production, and developing new collective economies is a path for rural economic development.

Premier Li Peng affirmed the practice of Xinjiang rural areas, with grassroots Party organizations as the core, village committees for organization, and tractor stations, agricultural technology promotion stations, seed stations, and other supporting implementation. He pointed out that rural areas in various places can create rural economic organizational forms suitable for local realities.

In the Shihezi Reclamation Area, Premier Li Peng visited the memorial to Premier Zhou Enlai, met with cadres and workers of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and the Eighth Agricultural Division, and visited the families of agricultural workers. Premier Li Peng highly praised the great contributions made by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in the past forty years in defending the border and building Xinjiang. Premier Li Peng said that practice has proven that the policy of defending the border through reclamation is successful. He hoped that the broad masses of workers in the Corps would, on the basis of the current situation, overcome difficulties, develop the economy, gradually achieve modernization, and build the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps better.

Premier Li Peng was very concerned about the exploration and development of Xinjiang's oil resources. On November 23, Premier Li Peng listened to a detailed report in Klamayi City from Wang Tao, General Manager of the China National Petroleum Corporation, and responsible comrades from the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration and other units regarding the situation of oil exploration in Xinjiang. Xinjiang is the region with the richest oil resources in China, with a very broad development prospect. Premier Li Peng said that Xinjiang's economy needs to be revitalized, and oil is the leading industry. He hoped that the broad masses of oil and geological workers would continue to work hard, grasp this work tightly, and provide energy guarantees for achieving the strategic goal of doubling the national GDP by the end of the century.

During the inspection period, Premier Li Peng specially visited the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the southwestern border of the motherland. Premier Li Peng told the soldiers and officers that Xinjiang is the western gate of the motherland, with a very important strategic position. For many years, you have guarded the border of the motherland under extremely harsh conditions. The contributions you have made will not be forgotten by the people of Xinjiang and the people of the whole country. Li Peng pointed out that the victory of suppressing the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots that occurred in the spring and summer once again proves that the People's Liberation Army is indeed the iron wall of the socialist republic. He hoped that the broad masses of soldiers and officers, under the guidance of the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, would make new contributions to the prosperity and unity of Xinjiang and the motherland, and to the security and consolidation of the border. Premier Li Peng also wrote a calligraphy for the South Xinjiang Military Region: "Love the border, work hard, selflessly dedicate, and strive to overcome difficulties."

During the inspection, Premier Li Peng also learned about the construction of railways in Xinjiang. He said that Xinjiang borders five countries, so the construction of the Northern Xinjiang Railway will become the second land bridge connecting Europe and Asia, providing favorable conditions for Xinjiang and the country to open up to the west, with important strategic significance. He hoped that everyone would work hard to achieve early connection.

Premier Li Peng was very concerned about the living conditions of the people of all ethnic groups on the border. During the inspection, he visited farmers' homes three times. On the afternoon of November 22, Premier Li Peng visited the home of Tuhudahong, a Uygur farmer in Tashikuerke Township, Yining City, surrounded by green belts and flat fields. Premier Li Peng, according to ethnic customs, sat cross-legged next to the host on a colorful carpet and had a friendly conversation. Premier Li Peng asked in detail about the labor and living conditions of Tuhudahong's family. The host said that his family's total income this year had reached 6,580 yuan. Premier Li Peng was very happy after hearing this and wished the host a happy family and a better life. In the home of Tuhudahong's neighbor, Qiuyumu, the township head Aikelaimu led in a fat lamb, saying, "According to our Uygur customs, when a distinguished guest comes, we should slaughter a sheep to entertain them." Premier Li Peng quickly waved his hand and said, "Don't slaughter, don't slaughter, we have received your kindness, thank you, thank you!"

During his stay in Xinjiang, Premier Li Peng also successively inspected the Yili Wool Textile Factory, Kashgar Art and Crafts Factory, Klamayi Heavy Oil Development Company, visited the Kashgar Etigah Mosque and the Apahojia Tomb, and met with local religious figures. During the inspection of the Yili Wool Textile Factory, Premier Li Peng affirmed the factory's practice of focusing on "high-end" and "low-end" products in response to the recent sluggish sales of light textile products. Premier Li Peng hoped that they would continue to work on increasing varieties, improving product quality, and reducing costs to overcome the difficulties faced by the enterprise.

　　李鹏总理视察天山南北
　　强调民族团结发展经济
　　要把各项事业搞上去首先要有稳定的政治局面
    新华社乌鲁木齐11月27日电　（记者何平、汪有富）中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理李鹏近日在新疆视察时反复强调，要把各项事业搞上去，首先要有稳定的政治局面。他指出，对新疆来说，摆在第一位的是加强民族团结，而民族团结的基础是发展经济，只有经济发展了，各民族才能共同繁荣。
    李鹏总理在圆满结束对南亚三国的正式友好访问回国之后，不顾疲劳，昼夜兼程，从11月21日至26日对地处祖国西北边陲的新疆维吾尔自治区进行了视察，把党中央和国务院的关怀和问候带给了这里的各族人民。李鹏总理等一行在各地受到了群众的热烈欢迎。
    在我国各省、自治区中，新疆是面积最大的一个。几天来，李鹏总理跨越天山南北，行程数千公里，先后视察了自治区首府乌鲁木齐，中苏边境地区的伊犁哈萨克自治州伊宁市，我国最早的石油基地之一克拉玛依油田，新疆生产建设兵团石河子垦区，以及南疆古丝绸之路上的重镇喀什，走访了农村、工厂、油田和部队，考察了解了工农业生产、油田开发、铁路建设、对外贸易、边防建设以及民族团结等方面的情况。离开乌鲁木齐前，李鹏总理还会见了自治区党政军各族领导干部，听取了自治区党委和人民政府的工作汇报，并作了重要讲话。
    随同李鹏总理视察的有：外交部长钱其琛、解放军副总参谋长何其宗、中国石油天然气公司总经理王涛等。
    全国政协副主席、新疆维吾尔自治区顾问委员会主任王恩茂，自治区党委书记宋汉良，自治区党委副书记、自治区主席铁木尔·达瓦买提，自治区党委副书记贾那布尔，新疆军区司令员高焕昌等陪同李鹏总理一起视察。
    在26日召开的新疆三千干部大会上，李鹏总理纵论国际、国内形势，阐述了党和政府的内政外交政策，并向各族干部传达了党的十三届五中全会精神，对新疆今后的工作提出了指导性意见。
    李鹏指出，贯彻五中全会精神，主要是解决好五个方面的问题。第一，要通过进一步治理整顿和深化改革，努力实现国民经济的长期持续、稳定、协调发展，这是我们在经济建设中必须始终坚持的指导方针；第二，要正确处理治理整顿与改革开放的关系，把两者有机结合起来。要始终坚持计划经济与市场调节相结合的原则；第三，全党都要重视农业，切实加强农业的基础地位；第四，要把控制通货膨胀作为治理整顿的中心任务，努力缓解社会总需求超过总供给的矛盾，逐步减少通货膨胀；第五，抓住现在某些产品出现“买方市场”的有利时机，调整工业结构，提高经济效益，化消极因素为积极因素。
    在视察过程中，李鹏总理看到新疆各族人民团结和睦，生活安定，经济发展，边防巩固，十分高兴。他指出，新疆地大物博，人口相对较少，土地肥沃，日照充足，具备发展大农业的有利条件。石油、煤炭等地下矿产资源也很丰富，发展前景广阔。希望经过各族人民共同努力，把新疆建设成为国家重要的农产品商品基地，为国家提供更多的粮、棉、糖；积极开发资源，为国家提供更多的石油和其他矿产品。
    视察中，李鹏总理反复强调了加强农业的重要性。他指出，经济要发展，农业是基础。农业问题始终是中国最重要的问题，我们11亿人要吃饭，只能靠我们自己的力量来解决。这个问题已越来越为全党所认识，所重视。
    在伊犁河谷和喀什农村的视察中，李鹏总理了解到，自农村改革以来，这里农村结合本地实际，在积极稳步地推行家庭联产承包责任制的同时，始终坚持了统一种植计划，统一机耕和灌溉，统一植保防疫和重大技术措施，统一农田基本建设，统一兴办各种公益事业等“五个统一”，在调动农户生产积极性的同时，保证了农业生产的适度规模经营。李鹏总理肯定了这一做法，他说，农村家庭联产承包责任制要稳定，不稳定不行。但是，农业发展的根本出路在于依靠科学技术。在有条件的地方，在农民自愿的条件下，积极稳妥地推进适度规模经营，建立、健全产前产后的服务体系和发展新的集体经济，是农村经济发展的一条路子。
　　李鹏总理肯定了新疆农村以基层党组织为核心，村民委员会进行组织，由拖拉机站、农技推广站、种籽站等配合实施的做法。他指出，各地农村都可以因地制宜地创造适合本地实际的农村经济组织形式。
    在石河子垦区，李鹏总理瞻仰了周恩来总理纪念碑，接见了新疆生产建设兵团和农八师的干部、职工，访问了农工家庭。李鹏总理高度赞扬了新疆生产建设兵团近四十年来屯垦戍边，为保卫边疆，建设新疆做出的巨大贡献。李鹏总理说，实践证明，屯垦戍边的政策是成功的。希望兵团广大职工在现有的基础上，克服困难，发展经济，逐步实现自身的现代化，把新疆生产建设兵团建设得更好。
    李鹏总理十分关心新疆石油资源的勘探和开发。23日，李鹏总理在克拉玛依市详细听取了中国石油天然气总公司总经理王涛和新疆石油管理局等单位负责同志关于新疆石油勘探情况的汇报。新疆是我国石油资源最丰富的地区，开发前景十分广阔。李鹏总理说，新疆的经济要振兴，石油是主导产业。他希望广大石油、地质工作者继续努力，把这项工作抓紧抓好，为实现到本世纪末国民生产总值翻两番的战略目标提供能源保证。
    视察期间，李鹏总理专程看望了驻守在祖国西南边疆的人民解放军南疆军区指战员。李鹏总理对指战员们说，新疆是祖国的西大门，战略位置十分重要。多年来，你们在极其艰苦的条件下，守卫了祖国的边防，你们所作出的贡献，新疆人民和全国人民是不会忘记的。李鹏指出，平息春夏之交发生的动乱和反革命暴乱的胜利再次证明，人民解放军不愧是保卫社会主义人民共和国的钢铁长城。他希望广大指战员在党的十三届五中全会精神指导下，为新疆和祖国的繁荣昌盛及各民族的大团结，为边防的安全和巩固作出新的贡献。李鹏总理还挥笔为南疆军区题词：“热爱边防，艰苦奋斗，无私奉献，顽强拚搏”。
    视察中，李鹏总理还了解了新疆铁路建设的情况。他说，新疆同五个国家接壤，因此北疆铁路的兴建，将成为连接欧亚的第二座大陆桥，为新疆也为全国向西部开放提供了有利条件，具有重要的战略意义。希望大家努力工作，争取早日实现接轨。
    李鹏总理非常关心边疆各族人民的生活情况，视察途中曾三次走访农户家庭。22日下午，李鹏总理来到林带环抱、田园平展的伊宁市塔什库勒克乡维吾尔族农民托乎达洪家访问。李鹏总理按照民族习俗，与主人并肩盘腿坐在花色地毯上亲切交谈。李鹏总理详细询问了托乎达洪全家的劳动和生活情况。主人告诉说，他今年全家总收入已达到6580元，李鹏总理听后非常高兴，他祝愿主人家庭幸福，日子越过越好。在托乎达洪的邻居克尤木家，乡长艾克拉木牵进一只肥羊羔说：“按照我们维吾尔族的礼节，尊贵的客人来了是要宰羊招待的。”李鹏总理笑着急忙摆手：“不能宰，不能宰，心意我们领了，谢谢，谢谢！”
    在新疆期间，李鹏总理还先后视察了伊犁毛纺织厂、喀什市工艺美术厂、克拉玛依油田重油开发公司，参观了喀什艾提尕清真寺和阿帕和加墓，会见了当地宗教界人士。在伊犁毛纺织厂视察时，李鹏总理肯定了这个厂针对近来轻纺产品销售疲软而采取的抓“高档”和“低档”两头产品的做法，李鹏总理希望他们继续在增加花色品种，提高产品质量，降低成本方面下功夫，克服企业遇到的困难。
