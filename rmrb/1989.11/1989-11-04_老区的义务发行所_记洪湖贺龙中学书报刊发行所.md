When it comes to book and newspaper distribution, people naturally think of the post office and the green-clad messengers—postmen—who pedal through the countryside. However, in the revolutionary base area of Honghu, where Marshal He Long once fought, people praise those who are not dressed in green postal uniforms and do not carry green postal bags—the voluntary distributors at He Long Middle School.

Over the past two years, the school leadership has frequently educated students to carry on the glorious traditions of their predecessors and strive for greater glory.

In response to some publications reforming their distribution methods, changing from postal distribution to self-distribution, and considering the vast and sparsely populated lake area with inconvenient transportation, the school established a voluntary distribution center to solve the problem of farmers having difficulty accessing newspapers. The school mobilized students to use the convenience of going home on Wednesdays and weekends to voluntarily deliver books and newspapers, and to propagate the party's policies and guidelines to the farmers, spreading the pathways to scientific enrichment.

Young farmer Hu Zhonghan, through the information delivered by the students, learned the technology of raising turtles. The story of earning 5,000 yuan from half an acre of turtle farming spread far and wide, further enhancing the reputation of the voluntary distribution center throughout the neighboring villages. Farmers trust the voluntary distribution center of He Long Middle School and eagerly flock to the center to subscribe to newspapers and magazines. They enthusiastically say, "Twenty eggs for half a year, it's worth it!"

In 1988, the voluntary distribution center distributed 3,600 books and newspapers, and this year it is expected to distribute 4,500 books and newspapers.

To this day, every Wednesday and weekend afternoon, from the campus of He Long Middle School, plainclothes postmen fly out, active on the paths leading to the lake area, spreading the party's voice and the seeds of enrichment among the masses.

    老区的义务发行所
    ——记洪湖贺龙中学书报刊发行所
    提起书报发行，人们自然想到邮局，想到身蹬脚踏车行进在乡间小道上的绿衣使者——邮差。可在洪湖革命老区、贺老总曾经战斗过的地方，人们交口称赞的却是那些没着绿色邮装、没挂绿色邮包的义务发行员——贺龙中学义务发行所里的同学们。
    近两年来，贺龙中学校领导经常教育同学们继承先辈的光荣传统、争取更大光荣。
    针对一些报刊改革发行方式，由原来邮局代办发行改为自办发行，而湖区地广人稀、交通不便的特点，为解决农民读报难，学校办起了义务发行所，发动学生利用每周周三、周末放学回家之便义务投递书报刊，并向农民宣传党的方针政策，传播科学致富的门径。
    青年农民胡中汉通过同学们传递的信息，学到了养鳖技术，养鳖半亩田，收入五千元的佳话不胫而走，更使义务发行所的声名传遍十里乡邻。农民群众信任贺龙中学的义务发行所，纷纷踊跃到义务发行所订购报刊。他们豪爽地说：“二十个鸡蛋管半年，值得！”
    一九八八年，义务发行所共发行书报三千六百份，今年将要发行书报四千五百份。
    至今，每到周三、周末的下午，从贺龙中学的校园里就飞出一个一个的便衣邮差，他们活跃在通往湖区的条条小径上，把党的声音、致富的种子撒播在千户万众之中。　（陶扬）
