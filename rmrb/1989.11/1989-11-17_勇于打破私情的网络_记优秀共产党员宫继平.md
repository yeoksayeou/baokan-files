Shortly after returning from his military service, Gong Jiping became the Party branch secretary of Jin Shun Village on the outskirts of Nanchang. Upon taking office, he discovered that the village owed over 10 million yuan in debt, with per capita income barely reaching 100 yuan. Many villagers had to work as temporary laborers in the city. He pondered repeatedly, realizing that the key to making the village prosperous was to act selflessly for the public good.

The first difficult task arose: the railway department had expropriated village land, providing 2 million yuan in compensation. The villagers strongly demanded, "Quickly distribute the money! Just divide it by the number of people in the village and pay it out immediately!" Some people were impatient.

"Everyone's money should be shared by everyone," others chimed in.

An old bachelor bought a pack of "Red Taiping" cigarettes and went to Gong Jiping's house, offering him a smoke: "Jiping, let's distribute the money! I'm counting on this money to get married!"

With over 350 households in the village, Gong Jiping visited each one, explaining why the money could not be distributed: "If we distribute the money, what happens when it's all spent? A chicken that lays eggs, eggs that hatch into more chickens, and more eggs—isn't that better?"

The villagers finally understood Gong Jiping's intentions.

Right next to the railway station, a simple hotel with 100 beds was built, along with a shoe factory and a poultry farm. The village established more than ten industrial and sideline production bases serving the city. That year, the village earned tens of millions of yuan. The people of Jin Shun smiled, and for the first time, each household received over 1,000 yuan.

Gong Jiping's father-in-law worked in a village-run processing factory. The village had planned to transfer him to the more profitable hotel several times, but Gong Jiping always refused. A few times, when the village discussed providing some assistance to a few villagers in need, his father-in-law's name was on the list, but Gong Jiping crossed it out. His father-in-law said, "I didn't even get any benefits from him; he even took away what I was entitled to."

Gong Jiping's younger brother is a carpenter. He made several dozen sofas to sell to the village-run hotel. The village officials circled the sofas, smiled, and nodded in approval. However, Gong Jiping intervened, saying, "The quality is poor, don't buy them!"

His younger brother pleaded desperately, but Gong Jiping remained unmoved; his younger brother cursed, and his sister-in-law added fuel to the fire, criticizing him indirectly. The "fight" spread from the office to the home. Even the most patient person couldn't tolerate it, and he couldn't help but get into a fight with his brother. Later, the township leaders criticized him, and no one dared to take advantage of the situation afterward.

Not only did he not acknowledge his brothers, but he also didn't "accept" his mother's favors. As Jin Shun Village's business grew, it lacked procurement personnel. His mother recommended a relative for the position. Gong Jiping found the relevant personnel and said, "This relative of mine is not suitable for the procurement job, we can't hire them. It's better to recruit publicly!" Not long after, a technically skilled unemployed youth was hired by the village-run enterprise, and Gong Jiping's mother found him, saying, "You don't even consider me, family members are not as good as outsiders!"

"Elder, collective matters must be handled with public interest at heart. If we all arrange positions for our relatives and friends, the village's business will collapse!"

Now, walking into Jin Shun Village, one sees rows of elegant small houses rising from the ground. Last year, the village's per capita output reached 14,000 yuan, with an average income of 3,240 yuan per labor force.

Jin Shun Village has become one of the richest villages in Jiangxi Province. Gong Jiping not only became an outstanding agricultural entrepreneur but was also recognized as an outstanding Communist Party member by higher authorities. Reflecting on the achievements of the past decade, Gong Jiping sincerely said, "I always feel that Communist Party members should unconditionally serve the people. We must have the courage to break the web of personal connections!"

    勇于打破私情的网络
    ——记优秀共产党员宫继平
    赵相如  陈栋林
    宫继平复员回来不久，当上南昌市郊进顺村党总支书记。他上任后才知道全村竟欠下10多万元的债，人均分配不足百元，许多乡亲只好去城里做临时工。他反复琢磨，要使全村富裕起来首要的是自己一心为公。
    第一件棘手的事来了：铁路部门征用了村里的土地，给了200来万元征地费。村民们强烈要求：“赶快分钱！”“就按村里的人头算，马上兑现才好！”有的人急不可待。
      “大家的钱大家得。”也有人如此应声。
    有个老单身买了包“红牡丹”，来到宫继平家，递上了烟：“继平，分掉吧！我还要指望这笔钱娶老婆呐！”
    全村有350多户人家，宫继平一家一家地做工作，说明为什么不能分钱的理由：“钱分了，吃光用光后咋办？一只鸡，让它生蛋，蛋变鸡、鸡生蛋，不是更好吗！”
    大家终于明白了宫继平的用意。
    就在火车站附近，一座有百个床位的简易的饭店落成了，一个皮鞋厂、家禽养殖场也开张了。全村办起了十几个为城市服务的各种工副业生产基地。当年，村里赚上几十万元。进顺人笑了，这一年他们破天荒地每户分到1000多元钱。
    宫继平的岳父在一个村办加工厂干活。村里几次准备将其调到经济效益高的饭店去，都被宫继平拒绝了。有几次村里研究给少数有困难的村民一点补助，名单上有他岳父名字，送到宫继平那里他又给划掉了。他的岳父说：“我不但没沾他的光，连我可以得到的也被他搞掉了。”
    宫继平的二弟是木匠。他赶制出几十张沙发要卖给村办的饭店。村里的干部绕着沙发转了一圈，笑一笑，算是拍板成交。宫继平却半路杀了出来说：“质量差，不要！”
    二弟苦苦哀求，他无动于衷；二弟破口大骂，弟媳火上加油，指桑骂槐。“战火”从办公室蔓延到家门口。再好的脾气也受不了，他忍不住上前与弟弟干了一架。后来乡领导批评了他，往后没有人敢钻空子占便宜。
    不光亲兄弟不认帐，就连亲娘的情也不“领”。进顺村业务大了，缺少采购员。他的亲娘推荐一个亲属让他安排。宫继平找到有关人员说：“我这个亲属不是搞采购员的料，不能要。还是公开招聘好！”事隔不久，一名有技术的待业青年被村里吸收到村办企业工作，宫继平的亲娘找到他说：“你一点都不把我放在眼里，家里人还不如外人！”
    “老人家，集体的事只能从公心出发，如果都要安排自己的亲友，村里的家业就要垮哩！”
    如今走进进顺村，只见一排排别致小楼房拔地而起。去年村里人均产值达到1.4万元，每个劳力平均收入3240元。
    进顺村成了江西省最富庶的村子之一，宫继平不仅成了优秀农民企业家，而且被上级评为优秀共产党员。面对10年来的成绩，宫继平推心置腹地说：“我总觉得共产党员应当无条件地为民办事。要勇于打破私情的网络！”
