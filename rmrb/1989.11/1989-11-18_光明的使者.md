The Messenger of Light

In the Beijing Nankou Military Eye Disease Research and Treatment Institute of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, patients affectionately refer to Colonel Li Yongqing, the chief physician, as the "Messenger of Light," praising his excellent medical skills.

There is a type of eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa. People who suffer from this disease have progressively narrowing visual fields, night blindness, and deteriorating vision until they eventually go blind. Li Yongqing and his comrades, however, have found new ways to treat this disease. In the past year and a half, out of the 86 patients he has treated and discharged, 85.4% have improved their vision, 50.1% have expanded their visual fields, and 16.3% have improved their dark adaptation.

Li Yongqing is not only skilled in medicine but also has high medical ethics. He deeply understands the importance of eyes to the human body and is fully responsible for treating patients. In late July, Zhang Guimei from Shenyang wrote to Li Yongqing, asking if there was an opportunity, please come to her home to examine her and her two children for eye diseases. Coincidentally, Li Yongqing was in Harbin in early August to participate in an academic exchange meeting. When the meeting ended, Li Yongqing fell ill with a high fever of over 39 degrees, but he ignored his own illness and the difficulty of buying a new ticket after getting off in Shenyang. On August 7, he arrived in Shenyang and examined the mother and her three children. After returning to the hotel, Li Yongqing, who had a high fever, collapsed on the bed.

One day in March this year, while inspecting the wards, he discovered that a female patient from Daqing, due to her eye disease, had a strained marital relationship and even contemplated suicide. On one hand, he encouraged her to actively cooperate with the treatment; on the other hand, he wrote to her husband multiple times and spoke to him face-to-face, eventually reconciling the couple. This patient, after treatment, improved her vision from 0.04 to 0.3 and expanded her visual field by more than 20 degrees, returning to work at her unit.

Patients thanking the doctor and giving the doctor some gifts seems to be a common practice. But Li Yongqing never uses treating patients as a condition for taking gifts. In March, a relative of a patient, to express gratitude, quietly placed a stack of RMB in Li Yongqing's office drawer. He discovered it and immediately returned it. In the early hours of May, a female patient's husband placed 1.5 kilograms of walnuts, 2 kilograms of red dates, and 3 kilograms of green beans in a washing basin outside Li Yongqing's home. The next day, Li Yongqing found the person who sent the gifts and immediately handed over 45 yuan, saying, "The extra money is for you to buy some tonic for your wife!" He then turned and left.

Li Yongqing goes to the post office a few miles away to send letters for patients, leads patients with extremely poor vision to the bathhouse to take a bath, and treats patients like family. But he always neglects his own family affairs. Once, his wife had surgery, and according to the regulations at the time, he could take time off to care for her, but he did not stay at home for a single day, devoting all his attention to the patients.

Due to the outstanding achievements of Communist Party member Li Yongqing in scientific research, his pursuit of technical excellence, and his sincere dedication to patients, the superior organization awarded him a third-class merit citation in August this year.

    光明的使者
    在北京南口解放军某部队眼底病研治所，病人亲切地称中校主治军医李永庆（见上图）为光明使者，赞扬他医术高明。
    有一种眼病叫视网膜色素变性。得了这种眼病的人，视野越来越小，夜盲，视力越来越差直至失明。李永庆和他的战友们却对这种病的治疗有了新的办法。近一年多来，经他治疗出院的86名患者中，视力提高的占85.4％，视野扩大的占50.1％，暗适应改善的占16.3％。
    李永庆不但医术高明，而且医德高尚。他深知眼睛对人体的重要。治病中，对病人负责到底。7月下旬，沈阳患者张桂芹给李永庆来信说，若有机会，请到她家给她和她的两个孩子看眼病。恰巧李永庆8月初在哈尔滨参加学术交流会。会议结束时李永庆病倒发烧达39度多，但他不顾自身有病，也不顾在沈阳下车后重新买票的困难，8月7日到了沈阳，给她母子三人看了病，回到旅社后，发烧的李永庆又病倒在床上。
    今年3月的一天，他在查病房时发现大庆一女患者由于患了眼病，夫妻关系不和以致想轻生时，一方面鼓励她积极配合治疗；另一方面给她丈夫多次写信和当面做工作，终于使他们和好。这位患者经过治疗，视力由0.04提高到0.3，视野扩大20多度，回单位已参加工作。
    病人感谢大夫，给大夫送点东西似乎是人之常情。但李永庆绝不把为患者治好病变作索取的条件。3月，一位患者亲属为了表示感谢，悄悄将一叠人民币塞进了李永庆的办公桌抽斗，他发现后立即退了回去。5月初的一个深夜，一位女患者的丈夫把1.5公斤核桃、2公斤红枣、3公斤绿豆倒在李永庆家门外的洗衣盆内，第二天李永庆查找到送东西的人后，立即拿出45元钱塞到对方手里，那人推辞不过，着急的说：“我买这些东西花了不到28元钱，你给这么多？”李永庆说：“多的钱就给你爱人买点滋补品吧！”说完扭头便走了。
    李永庆给患者到几里路外的邮局送信，引视力极差的患者到浴池洗澡，对病人真像亲人一样。但对自己家里的事却总是顾不上管。一次，他妻子做了手术，按当时规定，他可以休息照顾妻子，但他一天也没有在家里停留，把心事全用在病人身上。
    由于共产党员李永庆在科研中成绩突出，对技术精益求精，对病人满腔热情，上级组织在今年8月给他记了三等功。
