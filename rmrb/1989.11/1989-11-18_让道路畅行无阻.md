Editor's Note:

In urban areas, whether people are engaged in transportation, taking a bus, riding a bike, or walking, they all hope for roads that are well-connected and free of obstacles. A good traffic order is an important guarantee for production development and convenient living. However, maintaining traffic order requires the effort of every individual.

From the capital to various places, the exposed traffic congestion situations show that, in addition to objective factors such as construction, limited traffic capacity, and increased urban population flow, most are caused by human factors:

	•	Random parking of various vehicles, turning roads into parking lots;
	•	Random stacking of various materials, turning roads into warehouses;
	•	Random setting up of stalls, turning roads into markets;
	•	Random construction, turning roads into construction sites for "beard projects" and "zipper projects"...

	These various "random" actions undoubtedly violate urban traffic and urban management order, violate social ethics, and affect normal social life. Without strict rectification, it is not feasible.

	Road traffic order is closely related to every unit and every individual. As long as various departments coordinate and cooperate, each doing their part, and everyone contributes to the governance and rectification of road order, a good traffic environment can definitely be established.

### 让道路畅行无阻

    让道路畅行无阻
    在城镇，人们不论是搞运输，还是乘车、骑车、步行，都希望道路四通八达、畅行无阻。良好的交通秩序，是发展生产、方便生活的一个重要保证。但是，交通秩序的维护要靠每一个人。
    从首都乃至各地暴露出的交通拥挤情况看，除了由于施工建设、交通容量有限、城镇人口流量增加等客观因素外，多是由于人为因素造成的：
    随意停放各种车辆，把道路变成存车点；
    随意堆放各类物资，把道路变成仓库；
    随意摆摊设点，把道路变成商场；
    随意施工，使道路成为“胡子工程”、“拉链工程”的工地……
    这种种的“随意”，无疑违反了城镇交通和市容管理秩序，违反了社会公德，影响了正常的社会生活，不严加整顿是不行的。
    道路交通秩序，与每个单位，每个个人都密切相关，只要各部门协调配合，各司其职，大家都来为道路秩序的治理、整顿出把力，就一定能够建立一个良好的交通环境。
