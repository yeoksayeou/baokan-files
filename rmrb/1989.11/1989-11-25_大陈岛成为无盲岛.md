Da Chen, an island that was plundered several decades ago, has now become the first island in the southeastern coastal region to achieve full literacy, and has also popularized junior high school education among the younger generation. Relevant departments in Zhejiang Province, after an on-site inspection, praised this as a model for eliminating illiteracy in remote islands.

Who gave the fishermen the wings of knowledge? It was the People's Liberation Army stationed on the island.

The army began helping the fishermen with literacy in the early 1980s. At that time, among the fishermen on the island who were under 40 years old, 324 were illiterate. Due to a lack of knowledge, feudal superstitions such as worshipping gods and spirits were rampant. Ignorance is the root of all evil. Equipping the fishermen with knowledge is a fundamental project that cannot be delayed in building a civilized island!

The army's leadership immediately received praise and support from the Da Chen Town Party Committee. In a relatively short period, the garrison assisted in setting up 6 cultural night schools, selected 117 cultural teachers, organized 61 literacy groups, and insisted on holding classes three nights a week. There were no textbooks on the island, so the army specially sent people to the mainland to buy a batch of literacy readers, distributing one to each literacy student.

Da Chen Island covers only 14.6 square kilometers, but transportation is inconvenient, and fishermen live scattered. During windy or rainy weather, it was difficult for people to come to the night school. When fishermen couldn't come to school, the teachers went to them.

In the process of helping the fishermen with literacy, the cadres and soldiers experienced both sweetness and bitterness, and often encountered rejections. In Nan Tian Village, there was a 19-year-old young man who was lazy, reckless, and thought he could get by without education. Initially, when the soldiers came to teach him, he avoided them seven times. The soldiers, braving the wind and rain, visited him for the eighth time. This young man finally relented and that night learned 38 characters. From then on, the soldiers not only taught him characters but also lectured him on the principles of being a good person. Persistence paid off, and this young man worked hard, reformed himself, and became a well-respected youth.

The spread and improvement of cultural knowledge is the source of power for creating a better life. In the past, some fishermen on the island had to go to the town to ask scholars to write letters for them. Now, things are different. With the spread and improvement of cultural knowledge, fishermen have become more civilized and polite, and there are more skilled individuals. There are those who engage in technological innovation, and those who use marine and wind resources for scientific experiments. Household electrical appliances can almost always be repaired without leaving the village.

In recent years, there have been more than 20 small inventions initiated by local fishermen, which have significantly promoted the development of productivity.

　　大陈岛成为无盲岛
　　赵仁春
    大陈，一个在几十年前被劫掠的荒岛，如今已成为东南沿海地区第一个无盲岛，并在年轻一代中普及了初中文化。浙江省有关部门经过实地考察，称赞这里是边远海岛脱盲的样板。
    是谁给渔民插上了知识的翅膀？是驻守在岛上的人民子弟兵。
    这个部队帮助渔民扫盲是从80年代初开始的。当时全岛40岁以下的渔民中，目不识丁的有324名，由于缺乏知识，岛上求神拜佛的封建陋习盛行。愚昧是万恶之源。给渔民插上知识的翅膀，是建设文明岛的一项刻不容缓的基础工程！
    部队领导的这一想法，立即得到大陈镇党委的赞扬和支持。在较短时间内，驻岛部队协助地方办起了6所文化夜校，选派了117名文化教员，组织了61个扫盲小组，坚持每周3个晚上集中上课。岛上没有课本，部队专门派人到大陆买来一批扫盲读本，发给扫盲对象每人一册。
    大陈岛总面积不过14.6平方公里，但交通不便，渔民居住分散，遇到刮风下雨，来夜校上课的人困难不少。渔民不能来校上课，他们就送教上门。
    在为渔民扫盲中，干部战士有酸甜、有苦辣，吃“闭门羹”也是常有的事。南田村有个年仅19岁的小伙子，好逸恶劳，放荡不羁，觉得没有文化照样混饭吃。起初，战士登门教他识字，他接连7次避而不见。战士们冒着风雨第八次来到他家。这位青年人终于被感化了，当晚就坐下来学了38个字。打这以后，战士们一边教字，一边给他讲做人的道理。功夫不负有心人，这个小伙子刻苦学习，痛改前非，成了一位受人称赞的好青年。
    文化知识的普及和提高是创造美好新生活的力量源泉。过去，岛上一些渔民写封家信还得到集镇请秀才代劳。现在不同了，随着文化知识的普及和提高，渔民变得懂文明讲礼貌了，小能人也多起来了，有搞技术革新的，有利用渔水资源、风力资源进行科技试验的。家用电器维修几乎不用出村，就可以修好。
    近几年来，由当地渔民为主体搞起来的小发明就有20多项，有力地促进了生产力的发展。
