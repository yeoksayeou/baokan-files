Two more gold medals were awarded at the National Speed Skating Championships today. Rising stars Xu Ruihong and veteran Wang Xiuli emerged victorious in the women's short-distance all-around 500 meters and 1000 meters events, respectively.

Xu Ruihong, 21, from Qiqihar, won the women's short-distance all-around championship in March this year. Today, she skated the 500 meters in 42.09 seconds, the fastest time, defeating all competitors, including veterans Wang Xiuli and Ye Qiaobo. Liang Linhua, from the Songhua River team, another rising star, finished with a time of 42.56 seconds to take the silver medal. Ye Qiaobo, from the People's Liberation Army team, finished third with a time of 42.77 seconds.

In the women's 1000 meters event, 26-year-old Wang Xiuli from Harbin showcased her skills again, winning the gold medal with a time of 1 minute 27.82 seconds. Her teammate Liu Yuexi took the silver medal. Xu Ruihong finished third.

Wang Xiuli and Ye Qiaobo both made their first appearances in official competitions in two years. From the competition, it was evident that their psychological and competitive states were not very stable due to their long absence from formal competitions. Ye Qiaobo, in particular, lost her chance to compete for the all-around championship after falling during the 1000 meters race.

　　全国速滑赛又决出两枚金牌
　　新秀进步快表现出色
    新华社长春11月27日电　（记者胡浩）全国速滑锦标赛今天在这里又决出两枚金牌。后起之秀薛瑞红和老将王秀丽分别在女子短距离全能500米和1000米比赛中技压群芳。
    薛瑞红21岁，来自齐齐哈尔市，今年3月曾获全国速滑冠军赛女子短距离全能冠军。今天，她以42秒09的最快速度滑完500米全程，战胜了包括老将王秀丽、叶乔波在内的全部对手。松花江队的梁林花也是一名新秀，以42秒56夺得银牌，解放军队的叶乔波以42秒77名列第三。
    在女子1000米比赛中，哈尔滨市26岁的王秀丽再展风姿，以1分27秒82的成绩夺得冠军；她的队友刘月希获得银牌。薛瑞红名列第三。
    王秀丽和叶乔波都是两年来首次在正式比赛中露面。从比赛中看，她俩由于长期未参加正式比赛，心理和竞技状态不是很稳定，其中叶乔波因在1000米比赛中途摔倒而失去了争夺全能冠军的机会。
