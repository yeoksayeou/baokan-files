Jiang Zemin Meets with Nixon, Says China's Door Will Not Close
Will Do Concrete Things to Make Reform and Opening Up Better

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 31 (Reporters Yang Zidi, Zhu Yunlong) - CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin met with former U.S. President Richard Nixon this afternoon in Zhongnanhai. The two sides had a friendly and in-depth conversation lasting 1 hour and 50 minutes.

Jiang Zemin welcomed Nixon's visit. He said, "Seventeen years ago, Mr. Nixon, with the foresight and courage of a statesman, made important contributions to opening and developing Sino-U.S. relations. I hope he will continue to make new contributions to the development of relations between the two countries."

Mr. Nixon expressed great pleasure in meeting General Secretary Jiang Zemin. Nixon said, "The current Sino-U.S. relations are facing serious difficulties, but according to the spirit of the 1972 Shanghai Communiqué, despite the differences between the two countries, we can still find common ground that will link the two countries in the present and the future."

Jiang Zemin said, "Whether in office or not, we are all working for the interests of our respective countries. I also believe that despite the differences in social systems and values between China and the United States, we have many common interests in maintaining world peace and stability and in developing equal and mutually beneficial economic and trade relations. It was the case seventeen years ago, and it remains so today."

Jiang Zemin said, "As for China, we will unswervingly follow the socialist path with Chinese characteristics that suits China's national conditions. China's door, once opened, will not be closed, and we will not take the road of closing the country. We will always adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence to develop friendly relations with all countries and, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, develop economic and technological exchanges and cooperation with all countries. As for the recent events handled by China, this is purely China's internal affairs. China does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and does not allow other countries to interfere in China's internal affairs."

Jiang Zemin also answered questions about China's reform and opening-up policy. He said, "We will continue to adhere to the policy of reform and opening up, which is not just talk. We will do some concrete things, including implementing major projects and improving relevant regulations, to make reform and opening up better."

Both sides also exchanged views on some major international issues of common interest.

Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Vice Minister Liu Huaqiu attended the meeting.

    江泽民会见尼克松时说
    中国打开的大门不会关上
    将做一些切切实实的事情把改革开放搞得更好
    新华社北京10月31日电　（记者杨子迪、朱云龙）中共中央总书记江泽民今天下午在中南海会见了美国前总统理查德·尼克松。宾主进行了长达1小时50分钟的友好、深入的交谈。
    江泽民对尼克松来访表示欢迎。他说，17年前，尼克松先生以政治家的远见和魄力，在打开和发展中美关系方面作出了重要贡献，希望他继续为发展两国关系作出新的贡献。
    尼克松先生对结识江泽民总书记表示非常高兴。尼克松说，现在美中关系正面临着严重困难，但是，按照1972年上海公报的精神，尽管两国之间存在着分歧，仍能找到能够在现在和未来把两国联系在一起的共同点。
    江泽民说，不管担任或不担任公职，我们都是为各自国家的利益工作的。我也认为，尽管中美两国社会制度、价值观念不同，但在维护世界和平与稳定、发展平等互利的经贸关系方面有着许多共同利益。17年前是如此，今天依然如此。
    江泽民说，就中国而言，我们将坚定不移地走适合中国国情、具有中国特色的社会主义道路。中国已经打开的大门不会关上，不会走闭关锁国的道路。我们始终坚持在和平共处五项原则的基础上同各国发展友好关系，在平等互利的基础上同各国发展经济技术的交流与合作。至于不久前中国处理所发生的事件，这完全是中国的内政。中国从不干涉别国内政，也不允许别国对中国的内政进行干涉。
    江泽民还就中国的改革开放政策等问题回答了客人的提问。他说，我们将继续坚持改革开放的政策，这决不是只停留在口头上，我们将做一些切切实实的事情，包括落实一些重大项目和完善有关的法规，把改革和开放搞得更好。
    双方还就一些共同感兴趣的重大国际问题交换了意见。
    外交部部长钱其琛、副部长刘华秋参加了会见。
