The ancient and mysterious ice mountains of Pamir in China's western frontier have an old road. This road has a history of splendor, longevity, and periods of prosperity and decline.

In 139 BC, Zhang Qian was dispatched by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty to travel to the Western Regions via this road. Thirteen years later, he returned to Chang'an. Due to the treacherous journey, only he and Gan Fu survived out of over a hundred companions.

Xuanzang, who traveled to India to obtain Buddhist scriptures, also took this road. He endured hardships, crossing from Kashmir over the mountains to Pamir's Tashkurgan, and then to Kashgar. In his "Great Tang Records of the Western Regions," he described this ancient path: "Numerous cliffs and deep valleys, perilous and steep, vast accumulations of ice and snow, fierce and biting winds..."

Because of Zhang Qian and Xuanzang's fearless spirit and perseverance, and because of their successors—Western Region Protectorate commanders Zheng Ji and Ban Chao, who dedicated their lives to the cause, and because of the ancient and modern peoples' desire for peace and economic development, a road connecting China to Central Asia, the Middle East, and even Europe was opened. This is the famous Silk Road.

Subsequently, over the centuries, the sound of camel bells echoed, and merchants, messengers, travelers, and explorers from China and abroad traveled this road unceasingly. Marco Polo and the famous Swedish explorer Sven Hedin also entered China via this ancient Pamir road.

The sound of camel bells has echoed through two thousand years. This ancient road has seen the passage of long history. It was not until the 1950s that this ancient road began to change its aged appearance, gradually revealing a beautiful new face.

In 1954, during the first year of China's first Five-Year Plan, a road survey team from the Xinjiang Transportation Bureau followed the ancient paths and camel trails up to the Pamir, reaching altitudes of 4,000 to 5,000 meters. After more than a year of trekking, they completed the road survey from Kashgar to Tashkurgan County. In 1958, a 290-kilometer road was completed, with 81.5% of the route built on the foundation of the ancient Silk Road camel trails. Due to rough construction, many sections were merely leveled and surface-paved, leading to inherent flaws and subsequent issues. Sharp turns, steep slopes, and road damage remained severe, often causing blockages due to mudslides, water damage, landslides, or ice and rock collapses.

The Pamir Road finally saw a brilliant spring. If this road were extended by 130 kilometers, it would reach the Red Mountain Pass on the China-Pakistan border. In 1979, the governments of China and Pakistan agreed to exchange goods along this road.

However, even during the two good seasons chosen by the Chinese side for the exchange, the domestic section often faced unexpected snowstorms. In the summer of 1981, five Pakistani trucks departed from Karachi and successfully entered the Red Mountain Pass. When they reached the Tiger's Mouth section, they were suddenly trapped by a fierce snowstorm for three days and nights. When the storm subsided, the road was blocked, and the five trucks, which were supposed to deliver goods to Kashgar and load dried fruits like apricots, peaches, and figs, had to turn back to Karachi...

Repairing and extending the Pamir Road became a national priority.

On the last day of 1983, December 31, the State Planning Commission officially approved the reconstruction of the 290-kilometer road from Kashgar to Tashkurgan. Soon after, considering the reforms and international friendships, it was decided to extend the road from Kashgar to Tashkurgan to the Red Mountain Pass, connecting with Pakistan, increasing the length from the original 290 kilometers to 420 kilometers. This project was listed as a key national project in the Seventh Five-Year Plan, with an investment of 125 million yuan.

Pamir awoke and buzzed with activity.

A vast array of machinery, vehicles, materials, and personnel surged onto the Pamir, onto this ancient ice road.

The First Highway Engineering Team, the Third Highway Engineering Team, the Bridge Engineering Team, and the Fourth Brigade of the Second Division of the Traffic Police from the Xinjiang Transportation Bureau, totaling over 5,000 road builders, settled in the desert and snow mountains. The roar of engines and vehicles, and the songs and laughter of men and women, echoed through the Pamir. Tiger's Mouth, Brun Mouth, Subashi Pass, and the shores of Karakul Lake—wherever there was grass and trees, there were tents and stoves set up by the road builders.

Tajik herders emerged from the deep mountains and grasslands, from their nomadic tents, riding horses to the construction sites. They were surprised at first, then delighted. They entered the tents of the road builders as guests and then invited these road workers to their yurts.

The work was arduous, and the environment, labor, and living conditions were harsh.

Of the 5,000 road builders, 80% were young people. Many wore bell-bottom pants and flowered shirts, donned sunglasses, carried guitars, and stacks of magazines, bringing their ideals and curiosity to this land of eternal ice and snow. During the construction of this road, the author visited the Pamir snow mountains three times. Once, near the ice mountains by the Red Mountain Pass, there was a valley with about a dozen tents of road workers. At an altitude of 4,300 meters, the joyous sounds of labor and youthful laughter filled the air. In a small tent housing a few young women, four young women who had graduated from colleges in recent years enthusiastically conversed with the author.

"Were you assigned here or did you volunteer?"

"We filled out forms and volunteered to come here."

"How do you feel now that you're here?"

"It's much different from what we imagined. It's too hard here, the conditions are too poor. The bread and rice are not cooked well, it's hard to get vegetables, and there's nowhere to get a haircut..."

"Do you regret coming?"

"No! Young people should try new things. Building this road is a key national project, the only one in all of Xinjiang. We're proud to contribute, and besides, the westernmost part of the Silk Road—how many people want to come but can't..."

There was a girl named Wang Li, only 19 years old, who failed the college entrance exam and became a road worker. She braved the fierce winds and snow, sifting several cubic meters of stones a day, building ten-meter slopes, and outworking men. However, the strong ultraviolet rays and biting cold turned her fair skin dark. Her nails chipped, her lips cracked, and her skin peeled. She cried and thought about giving up, but she persevered day by day, month by month, becoming tough and strong, and became a young shock worker and an advanced producer in the brigade.

Some comrades paid an even higher price, including their blood and lives.

Young soldier Wang Lingsuo was one of them. He was a soldier in the Fourth Brigade of the Second Division of the Traffic Police, assigned to work in the Urumqi garrison. When the unit went to the Pamir, he was tasked with the construction of the "Tiger's Mouth" section. From letters from his comrades, he learned that the living conditions were harsh and the environment dangerous, with "winds blowing rocks away and no grass on the ground," almost requiring half a mountain to be tunneled through for the road to pass. Reading these letters, he couldn't stay calm and repeatedly wrote to the platoon leader Huang Qingping, requesting to go to the "Tiger's Mouth" to fight. His request was approved, and the organization assigned him to manage the generator on the construction site. He said, "I came here to go to the front line, to the most dangerous place." The platoon leader decided to give him a Japanese-made D80 heavy bulldozer to drive and quickly appointed him as the deputy squad leader of the mechanical squad.

On December 11, 1986, Wang Lingsuo ate two steamed buns and arrived early at the construction site to replace another bulldozer operator who had gone back to the unit for lunch.

He agilely climbed onto the heavy bulldozer, operating it to clear stones, shovel by shovel, the roar of the engine shaking the valley. The small mountain of stones became lower and smaller. Suddenly, a loud noise, and more than 3,000 cubic meters of stones cascaded down, engulfing everything...

His comrades frantically rescued him for two hours, finding the tilted D80 heavy bulldozer. Wang Lingsuo was in pieces, and in the arms of platoon leader Huang Qingping, he still gazed lovingly at the towering Pamir snow mountains. The surrounding comrades shed tears, paying their respects...

Despite the hardships and sacrifices, this road, this ancient path, this snow mountain, this Pamir, was like a powerful magnetic field, attracting batch after batch of excellent young people. Senior engineer and road expert Shen Yongxiang, who was half a century older than Wang Lingsuo, came to the Red Mountain Pass at an altitude of nearly 5,000 meters, leading a small team to complete the survey of 72 kilometers of road.

In September 1987, the black asphalt road reached the hometown of the former county magistrate of Tashkurgan, Dalabudal Village. This magistrate from the 1950s and 1960s was now elderly and retired at home, recently suffering from a serious illness. He asked his family to arrange for him to live in a small earthen house near the road, so he could hear the noise of construction and the honking of cars. The road workers set up tents not far from his small earthen house. After a day's hard work, the road workers returned to their tents to rest. Under the moonlight, Xirenbieke quietly came to the road. At this moment, the moonlight on the plateau illuminated the newly paved black road, shining silver. Xirenbieke crawled on the road emitting a fragrant asphalt smell, lightly and deeply kissing it. His tears fell on the road, and he smiled happily and contentedly.

Soon, this old magistrate peacefully passed away in this earthen house. He did not see the magnificent opening ceremony, but he had waited for this road.

Since the construction of this road began in March 1986, Chairman of the National People's Congress Wan Li, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Sima Yi Aimaidi, Minister of the Ministry of Communications Qian Yongchang, and the party and government leaders of Xinjiang all came to this road to understand the progress of construction and to visit the road workers and traffic police officers of various ethnic groups. In August 1987, after listening to the report from the road construction command in Kashgar, Wan Li said to them, "We must have a sense of urgency. The sooner we complete this road, the sooner we will benefit from the world."

The Pamir Road was completed and opened to traffic on October 1, 1988. The entire length is 420 kilometers, starting from Kashgar and ending at the Red Mountain Pass on the China-Pakistan border. It winds through the Karakoram Mountains and the Pamir Plateau, passing by the world's second-highest peak, K2, and the famous Kongur and Muztagh mountain ranges. Most of the route is between 3,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level, with the highest point at 5,000 meters. Its speed and quality have written a new chapter in China's road construction history. One year after the road opened, in late September 1989, I once again ascended the Pamir. This road, like a colorful ribbon, carried me through the snow mountains, constantly suppressing my excitement. That day, I stayed in the newly built Pamir Hotel in the county town. Several Tajik female service staff approached us. Black eyebrows, big eyes, red cheeks. A year ago, they were still herding sheep in the nearby ice and snow. Now, they wore red suits, applied a thin layer of makeup, and smiled sweetly, like fairy maidens from the ice mountains suddenly descending to the human world. The service staff brought us fragrant milk tea and a plate of fresh grapes.

"Ah! We can eat grapes here!"

"Just bought from the snow mountain 'bazaar,'" said 32-year-old Deputy County Magistrate Yuan Jianmin. "Rest a bit, I'll take you to the snow mountain 'bazaar' to see."

Bazaar, meaning market. It was established only in the past year or two after the road was opened. Originally, it was a quiet alley, but now there are nearly 100 shops of various sizes. In the open-air areas in front of these shops, there are also various stalls. In addition to various clothing and goods, there are more vegetables and fresh fruits that had never been seen here for thousands of years. I walked into the bazaar and saw a few high-altitude tourists from Britain and Switzerland. After a long journey, they unexpectedly bought sweet grapes here, surprised and joyfully dancing with bunches of grapes in the bazaar, letting their companions take photos. Indeed, standing in this bazaar, tasting the sweet grapes, with the silver light of the snow mountain father—Muztagh Peak—shining on the bazaar, on people's faces, and on those bunches of grapes, it was a unique highland charm.

The ancient tradition of the Tajik people is not to engage in commerce. Pure and simple Tajik nomads, in the past, their largest transaction was to exchange a fat sheep for a box of matches, and they did not understand what money was. Many herders used stones to count numbers, how many horses they had, and how many stones they had in their pockets. If they lost or slaughtered a horse, they would throw out that many stones. The construction of the road and a few years of reform and opening up have brought some merchants to the Pamir ice mountains. They travel near and far, to Kashgar, to Urumqi, to Beijing, and to Shanghai. Local people say, "We Tajiks not only learn to do business, but also on this Pamir Plateau, we have opened up our first bustling bazaar. This is a historical mark, a spring breeze brought by reform and the road to our snow mountains."

The next day, we departed from the county town and continued forward, directly reaching the much-anticipated Red Mountain Pass along the beautiful road. We rested briefly at a certain forward post of the border defense troops at an altitude of 4,700 meters. The young and vigorous, dark-skinned border defense soldiers, dressed in neat suits, smiled and saluted us: "The border is just ahead."

Standing at the border, looking into the distance, "Ten thousand mountains piled with snow, snow pressing ten thousand mountains," and nearby, there were even narrower, more winding, and steeper valleys, as well as the beautiful road passing through beneath our feet. Seeing these, a thought suddenly flashed through my mind: perhaps we could still find the footprints of Xuanzang and Marco Polo who traveled here long ago.

Time has indeed passed, but now I see two red and black stone memorials standing in front of me: one is the Sino-Pakistan Friendship Road Opening Memorial, and the other is the border marker. Leaving the pass, I came to the location of the Red Mountain Pass Customs. A few years ago, it was so desolate and solemn, with only a few border defense soldiers on duty. Today, it has become a bustling small town. New buildings dot the valley at the foot of the ice mountain, making it colorful. The border defense station, Chinese customs, health inspection station, plant and animal inspection station, bank exchange station, mail exchange station, border meeting hall, and public security station are all busy every day, filled with a friendly international atmosphere. The road passenger station here has 25 large cars, and the daily buses can travel to the Sust region in Pakistan. Pakistani buses also enter our territory. According to the person in charge of the port management committee, since the road officially opened, the Red Mountain Pass has become more and more prosperous. There have been tourists, businessmen, diplomats, mountaineers, pilgrims, visitors, journalists, and trade caravans from nearly 50 countries and regions in five continents safely and smoothly passing through this port. In the summer and autumn of this year, in a few months, more than 8,240 people and 5,400 tons of goods have entered and exited the border. As we were talking, a few clear car horns sounded, and a few "camper vans" turned a mountain bend and came to us. They were caravans from Pakistan. The drivers and passengers on the cars nodded, winked, and smiled at us, then the engines roared again, heading towards Tashkurgan County, towards Kashgar, along this young and ancient, beautiful and mysterious new Silk Road, towards China.

The Pamir Road—one of the most remote and mysterious roads on our motherland.

Our motherland will have more Pamir Roads!

　　帕米尔之路
    凌愉
    我国西部边陲古老而神奇的帕米尔冰山上有一条古老的路，这条路曾有过灿烂悠久而又时兴时衰的历史。
    公元前139年，张骞受汉武帝派遣，出使西域走的是这条路。13年后回到长安，由于路途艰险，100多人的随从最后只剩下他和甘父两个。
    玄奘从印度取经回国，走的也是这条路。他艰难跋涉，由克什米尔翻山到帕米尔的塔什库尔干，然后到达喀什。他在《大唐西域记》中是这样描叙这条古道的：崖岭数百，幽谷险峻，广积冰雪，寒风劲烈……
    因了张骞、玄奘的不畏艰险、再接再厉的“凿空”精神，因了他们的后继——西域都护郑吉、班超倾一生心血努力拚搏经营，更因了古往今来各族人民渴求和平和经济发展的心理底蕴，一条中国连接中亚、西亚乃至欧洲的道路开通了，这就是闻名世界的丝绸之路。
    以后，岁月漫漫，驼铃叮当，中外商贾、信使、旅行家、探险家，始终络绎不绝。马可·波罗以及瑞典著名探险家斯文赫定也从这条帕米尔古道进入中国，走向内地。
    悠悠的驼铃声摇去了漫长的两千年岁月，漫长的历史从这条古道上走过。到了二十世纪五十年代，这条古道才开始改变它苍老的面貌，渐渐展现出美丽的新容。
    1954年，我们国家刚刚进入第一个五年计划的第一年，新疆交通厅的一支公路测量队伍沿着昔日的古栈道和驼马道登上了海拔高达4000到5000米的帕米尔，经过一年多的徒步跋涉，完成了从喀什至塔什库尔干县城的公路测设任务。1958年，修通了这条290公里长的公路，其中81.5％的路段是在丝绸之路的驼马古道的基础上搞起来的。由于施工粗糙，许多路段只是采取抢平和表面铺垫的简单办法修建，先天不足，后天失调，沿途的急弯、陡坡、病害仍十分严重，遇到翻浆、水毁、泥石流或冰雪土石塌方，公路就被堵塞。
    帕米尔公路终于迎来了灿烂的春天。这条公路如果再延伸130公里，就到了中巴边境的红其拉甫，1979年，中巴两国政府就达成了两国沿这条公路互换物资的协议。
    然而，即使由中方选择的一年两次的好季节两国车队交换，也常常为我们国内段意外的风雪所阻。1981年夏，巴基斯坦五辆卡车从卡拉奇出发，顺利进入红其拉甫山口，行驶到老虎嘴地段时，被突然而至的狂风暴雪所困，困了三天三夜，风雪停了，公路也断了，这五辆应该到喀什城卸下物资再装上杏干、桃皮、无花果等干果的汽车，被迫掉转车头，返回卡拉奇……
    修好和延长帕米尔公路，被提到国家的议事日程。
    1983年的最后一天——12月31日，国家计委正式下文，批准了喀什至塔什库尔干共290公里公路的重修。不久，考虑到改革开放和国际间的友好往来，又批准将喀什至塔什库尔干公路延长至红其拉甫山口，与巴基斯坦连接起来，由原定的290公里增至420公里。此项工程，被列为七五建设计划国家重点建设项目，共投资1.25亿元。
    帕米尔惊醒了，沸腾了。
    浩浩荡荡的机具、汽车、物资、人员，昼夜不停地涌上了帕米尔，涌上了这冰山古道。
    新疆交通厅的第一公路工程队，第三公路工程队，桥工队，交通武警二总队四支队，共5000多名筑路大军在戈壁雪山驻扎了下来，汽车和机械的轰鸣声，男人和女人的歌声笑声，响彻着帕米尔。老虎嘴、布伦口、苏巴什大坂、喀喇库里湖畔，凡是有草有树的地方，都有筑路员工搭起的帐篷，砌起的炉灶。
    塔吉克族的牧民从深山草原，从游牧的帐篷里走了出来，骑着骏马来到工地旁，他们诧异了一阵，喜悦了，他们走进筑路员工的帐篷作客，然后又请这些筑路职工到自己的毡房里作客。
    工程十分艰巨，环境、劳动、生活更是艰苦。
    五千人的筑路大军，80％是青年人。不少的人穿着喇叭裤和花衬衣，戴着墨镜，抱着电吉它，提着一摞一摞的画报，带着理想、好奇，来到这终年冰雪覆盖的帕米尔，献出他们的青春、热血。在修建这条公路期间，笔者曾三次登上帕米尔雪山采访，有一次笔者来到红其拉甫附近的冰山下一条河谷旁。这里海拔4300米，有十几顶筑路工的帐篷。走进这个驻地，到处都可见到欢快的劳动声和青春的笑声。在一顶小小的、住着几位年轻姑娘的帐篷里，四名近几年才从大专院校毕业的青年热情与笔者交谈。
      “你们是分配来的还是自愿来的？”
      “是填了表，自愿到这里来的。”
      “来了后，感觉怎么样？”
      “与想象的差得太远了，这里太苦，条件太差，馍馍米饭都蒸不熟，很难吃到蔬菜，连理个发的地方都找不到……”
      “有点后悔了吧？”
      “不！青年人嘛，闯闯有好处，修这条公路毕竟是国家的重点建设计划，全新疆就这么一项，我们尽点力是个光荣，而且，这丝绸之路的最西缘，多少人想来还来不了哩……”
    有个叫王莉的姑娘，才19岁，高考落榜到这里当了一名筑路工。她顶着狂风大雪，一天可以筛几立方米的石子，打十米的边坡，赛过男子汉。但是，强烈的高原紫外线和凛冽的寒风使她白嫩的白肤变成紫黑色。指甲翘了，嘴唇裂了，皮肤皴了。她哭过，想过当逃兵，但她一天一天，一月一月终于坚持下来了，变得刚毅而坚强了，成为工地上的一名青年突击手，大队的先进生产者。
    有些同志付出了更加高昂的代价，包括自己的鲜血和生命。
    青年战士王灵锁就是其中之一。他是交通武警二总队四支队的一名战士，领导上把他安排在乌鲁木齐留守处工作。部队上了帕米尔，担负着
  “老虎嘴”地段的施工任务。王灵锁从战友的来信中得知，这里生活艰苦，环境险恶，是“风吹石头跑，地无一棵草”的悬崖绝壁，几乎要打通半座雪山，公路才能穿越过去。读着这些信，他无法平静，几次写信给连长黄庆平，请求到“老虎嘴”参战。他的请求被批准了，组织上让他在工地上看管发电机，他说：“我来这里，目的就是要到第一线，到最危险的地方去。”连长决定把一辆日本产D80重型推土机交给他驾驶，并很快任命他为机械班副班长。
    1986年12月11日中午，王灵锁吃完两个馒头提前来到了施工工地，替换另一名推土机手回连队吃饭。
    他矫健地登上重型推土机，操纵着清运石料，一铲一铲，轰轰的马达声震撼山谷，小山一样的石堆变低了，变小了。但是，突然之间，一声巨响，3000多方石头铺天盖地倾塌下来，吞噬了这里的一切……
    战友们紧张地抢救了两个小时，找到了压偏了的D80重型推土机，王灵锁已血肉模糊，在连长黄庆平的怀抱里他还留恋地望了一眼巍巍帕米尔雪山，围上来的战友泪珠串串，向他默哀……
    尽管艰苦，尽管有牺牲，但这公路，这古道，这雪山，这帕米尔，却像个磁力极强的磁场，把无数的优秀儿女一批一批吸引到这里。比王灵锁的年纪整整大半个世纪的高级工程师、72岁的公路专家沈永祥，来到海拔近5000米的红其拉甫地段，率领一支小分队完成了72公里的公路测绘任务。
    1987年9月，黑色路面铺到塔什库尔干县老县长西仁别克的家乡达布达尔村。这位五六十年代的县长已年迈退休在家，近来患了重病。他要求家人把他安排住在靠近公路的一间小小的土屋里，他要听到修路的喧嚣声和汽车的喇叭声。筑路工人在他小土屋的不远处搭起了帐篷，劳累了一天的筑路工人回帐篷休息去了。在月亮下，西仁别克悄悄来到公路。这时，高原上的月亮把刚刚铺成的崭新的黑色路面照耀得银光闪烁，西仁别克匍伏在散发着芬芳的沥青味的路面上，轻轻地、深情地吻着，泪水滴在公路上，他欣慰地幸福地笑了。
    不久，这位老县长安详地在这间土屋里去世了。他没有看到壮观的通车典礼，但他盼来了这条公路。
    这条公路从1986年3月动工修建后，全国人大委员长万里、全国政协副主席司马义·艾买提、中央交通部部长钱永昌，以及新疆党政领导均先后来到这条公路，了解修建进程，亲切看望各族筑路职工和交通武警指战员。万里同志1987年8月在喀什听取筑路指挥部汇报后，对他们说：“要有紧迫感，我们早一天修通这条公路，我们就早一天得益于世界。”
    帕米尔公路于1988年10月1日竣工通车。全程420公里，起于喀什，止于中巴交界的红其拉甫山口，它盘旋在喀喇昆仑山和帕米尔高原，途经海拔8611米的世界第二高峰乔戈里峰山麓以及举世闻名的公格尔和慕士塔格山脉，大部分路段在海拔3000至4000米，最高点海拔5000米，其速度和质量都在我国公路建设史上写下了新的篇章。公路通车一年后，即1989年9月下旬，我再一次登上帕米尔。这条公路宛如一条彩带载着我在雪山上蜿蜒飘荡，时时抑制不住心内的激动。当天，我住在县城新建的帕米尔宾馆，几位塔吉克族女服务员向我们款款而来。黑眉毛，大眼睛，红脸蛋。一年前，她们还在附近的冰山雪野放羊。如今，她们身着红色的西装套裙，面施薄薄的脂粉，露出甜甜的笑意，好像是神话中的冰山仙女忽然降临人间。服务员给我们端来的，除芬香的奶茶，竟是一盘盘鲜美的葡萄。
      “啊！这里能吃到葡萄！”
      “刚从雪山‘巴扎’买来的。”32岁的副县长袁建民说道，“休息一会，我领你们去雪山‘巴扎’看看。”
    巴扎，集市的意思。是近一两年公路修通后才建立起来的。这里原来是一条冷清的巷道，现在有将近100间大小不等的商店。在这些店铺前面的露天场地上又摆满了各种小摊。除了各式衣物百货外，更多的是这里千百年来从来见不到的各种蔬菜和时鲜瓜果。我走进巴扎，见到几位来自英国和瑞士的高山旅游者，他们经过长途的旅行，在这里意外地买到鲜甜的葡萄，惊异的同时，欣喜得提着串串葡萄在巴扎上手舞足蹈，让同伙一个劲地拍照。是呀，站在这巴扎上，尝着清甜的葡萄，身后冰山之父——慕士塔格雪峰的银光披洒在巴扎上，披洒在人们的脸上和那一串串葡萄上，的确是一种非同寻常的高原情趣。
    塔吉克族的古老传统是不经商的。纯朴的塔吉克族游牧民，过去最大的交易是用一头肥羊去换一盒火柴，从来不懂货币为何物。许多牧民以石子计算数字，有多少匹马，口袋里就有多少颗石子，丢失或者宰了多少匹马，就从口袋里扔出去多少颗石子。公路的修建，几年的改革开放，使帕米尔冰山出现了一些经商者，他们近的跑喀什，跑乌鲁木齐，远的跑北京和上海。当地群众说：“我们塔吉克族现在不但学会了经商，而且在这帕米尔高原开天辟地有了自己的第一个热闹的巴扎，这是一个历史的标记，是改革和公路给我们雪山送来的春风。
    第二天，我们从县城出发继续往前走，沿着漂亮的公路径直抵达令人神往的红其拉甫山口。我们在海拔4700米的边防军某前哨班短暂休息，年轻威武，皮肤黝黑，身穿笔挺呢服的边防军人微笑着向我们敬礼：“前面就是国界线了。”站在国界线，眺望远处，“万山堆积雪，积雪压万山”，近处，则是更加狭窄、弯曲、陡峭的山谷，以及脚下横穿而过的漂亮的公路。看到这些，我的脑海里忽然闪现一个念头，说不定，我们还可以在这里寻觅到当年玄奘、马可·波罗跋涉过的足迹哩。
    悠悠岁月毕竟过去，此刻我看到的是面前矗立着的两块红黑文字的汉白石纪念碑：一块是中巴友好公路通车纪念碑；一块是国境界碑。离开山口，我来到红其拉甫海关所在地。几年前这里是那样的孤寂肃穆，只有几名边防战士值勤，今天已变成一个热闹繁华的小镇。一幢幢崭新的建筑把冰山脚下的山谷点缀得五彩缤纷。边防站，中国海关，卫生检查站，动植物检查站，银行兑汇站，邮件交换站，边境会议会晤厅，以及治安派出所，每天一片繁忙，充满了一种友好的国际色彩。这里的公路客运站已有25辆大轿车，每天从这里发出的班车可开到巴基斯坦境内的苏斯特地区，巴方的班车也开到我国境内。据口岸管理委员会的负责人介绍，公路正式通车以来，红其拉甫口岸日益红火，已有世界五大洲近50个国家和地区的旅游者、商人、外交、登山、朝觐、探亲人员、新闻记者以及贸易商队安全顺利通过这个口岸，今年夏秋两季几个月时间，从这里出入境者达8240多人次，货物5400多吨。正在我们交谈之时，传来几声清脆的汽车喇叭声，几辆
  “大篷车”拐过一道山弯来到我们面前，它是从巴基斯坦开过来的商队。车上的司机和乘客向我们亲切地点头、挤眼、微笑，然后又响起欢快的马达，向塔什库尔干县城开去，向喀什市开去，沿着这条年轻而古老，美丽而神奇的丝绸新道，向中国开去。
    帕米尔之路——我们祖国大地上最边远最神奇的一条公路。
    祖国大地，会有更多的帕米尔之路！
