The Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity, Salim Ahmed Salim, recently told reporters from the Pan-African News Agency that the South African authorities have not taken any significant actions that would lead one to expect meaningful changes in South Africa.

Salim said that the release of Sisulu and seven other political prisoners, who have been detained for nearly 26 years, is of course welcome, but this release is due to the growing resistance of South African blacks, the democratic movement of the masses, and the effective pressure from the international community. He believes that while South African President de Klerk may have some inspiring proposals, it is premature to view de Klerk's statements of intent as a meaningful fundamental change by the South African government, as de Klerk and his associates have not made any statements that would convince people that they are opposed to the apartheid system and want to change it.

Salim also said that the international community must continue to pressure South Africa, especially in terms of sanctions, because economic sanctions can be effective.

The Kenyan representative, Okoyo, today in his speech at the UN General Assembly called on the international community to adopt stricter sanctions against South Africa's apartheid policies.

Okoyo proposed six points in his speech, including reducing trade and financial relations with South Africa, prohibiting the import of all non-strategic minerals and manufactured goods from South Africa, prohibiting investors from producing and selling platinum bars and coins, and prohibiting loans to South Africa and restricting investments.

Okoyo also suggested that the various political factions in South Africa negotiate on the following issues, including ending the state of emergency imposed by the South African government, releasing all political prisoners and the leader of the African National Congress of South Africa, Mandela, and lifting the ban on political organizations and anti-apartheid groups.

Okoyo also proposed that South Africa convene a round-table conference with all parties to negotiate a final agreement, and suggested that the UN Secretary-General and the OAU send representatives to participate in the conference as observers and advisors.

    非统秘书长呼吁继续对南非施加压力
    肯尼亚要求对南非实行更加严厉制裁
    新华社达喀尔11月8日电  非洲统一组织秘书长萨利姆·艾哈迈德·萨利姆最近对泛非新闻社记者发表谈话时说，南非当局尚未采取任何重大行动可以使人们期待它想要在南非作出有意义的变化。
    萨利姆说，释放西苏鲁和其他7名被关押近26年的政治犯当然是受欢迎的，但是这种释放靠的是南非黑人日益强大的反抗、群众的民主运动和国际社会有效的压力。他认为，南非总统德克勒克也许有某些会令人鼓舞的主张，但是目前把德克勒克的意向声明当作南非政府有意义的根本变化可能是错误的，因为德克勒克及其合作者尚未发表任何讲话可以使人们相信他们是反对种族隔离制度和想要予以改变的。
    萨利姆还说，国际社会必须坚持对南非施加压力，特别是在制裁方面，因为经济制裁是可以起某些作用的。
    新华社联合国11月9日电  肯尼亚代表奥科约今天在联大发言中呼吁国际社会对南非的种族隔离政策采取更为严格的制裁措施。
    奥科约在发言中提出了6点建议，其中包括减少同南非的贸易和金融往来，禁止从南非进口所有非战略性矿产品和制造业产品，禁止投资者为南非生产、销售白金条和白金币，禁止向南非贷款并对投资加以限制。
    奥科约还建议南非各派政治力量就下列问题进行谈判，其中包括结束南非政府强加的紧急状态，释放所有政治犯及南非非洲人国民大会领袖曼德拉，取消对政治团体、反种族隔离组织的禁令。
    奥科约还建议南非召开有各方参加的圆桌会议，就谈判达成最后方案，并提议联合国秘书长和非统组织派代表以观察员和顾问的身份参加会议。
