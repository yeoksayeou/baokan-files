There is a fact that is not entirely outdated. In early 1979, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences decided to compile "Chinese Minority Nationalities Literature." Two associate professors from Yunnan Nationalities University were tasked with writing the literary overview of the Achang people. However, after searching through all the literary publications in the country, they found no works by Achang writers or Achang folk literature. Their work had to start from field surveys.

The Achang people have their own language but no written script. Their rich cultural heritage is passed down orally. Over the years, due to rapid changes in social life, strong impacts from external cultures, and deliberate destruction, the ancient traditional culture of the Achang people is on the verge of extinction. After liberation, the Achang people, along with all other ethnic groups in the country, gained political emancipation and became masters of their own land. However, in terms of cultural construction, although some work has been done, there have been few achievements.

When the literary overview investigation team arrived at the Achang mountain village, an elderly Achang cadre emotionally said, "Since liberation, there have been no images of Achang people on the screen, no voices of Achang people on the radio, no Achang music on the stage, and no Achang life in literary works. Our culture is still a blank page!"

From that year on, the cultural heritage of the Achang people began to receive attention.

The two counties of Lianghe and Longchuan in the Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture of Dehong, Yunnan, where the Achang people reside, organized a folk literature investigation team specifically for the Achang people. Relevant departments also sent experts to assist in the work. They started from the villages, seeking singers, inviting "living masters" (scholars), and rescuing and collecting Achang folk literature and arts. They discovered many precious cultural relics and folk literary works. For example, the epic "Zhapama and Zhimima," which has been translated and compiled into over 2,000 lines, is an important resource for studying ancient Achang literature, philosophy, aesthetics, and social thought. After the discovery of "Wuluo," a literary and artistic form that integrates Achang poetry, song, and dance, it quickly became a beloved recreational activity for the entire nation. In accordance with the wishes of the Achang people and the provisions of Article 4 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, in April 1983, the Eighth People's Congress of Dehong Prefecture designated Wuluo Festival as a traditional festival of the Achang people.

In recent years, the investigation and compilation of ethnic literature have yielded abundant results. Central, provincial, and municipal publications have successively published hundreds of Achang folk literary and artistic works. In September 1983, the Dehong Nationalities Publishing House published "Selected Works of Achang Literature." In 1985, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission edited five series of books, including "A Brief History of the Achang People" and "A Brief Dictionary of the Achang Language," which were published one after another.

The three-episode ethnic customs special "Achang Customs" shot by Yunnan Television in 1985 won the second prize in the excellent television column program of the third national competition and participated in the 1988 London International Television Week for cultural exchange.

With the development of the education cause in the Achang region, a group of writers has emerged among the Achang people. Their poems, essays, novels, reportage, and scripts have been published in central, provincial, municipal, and prefectural publications. Some have even won national and provincial awards.

    从村寨开始
    曹先强（阿昌族）
    这里有一个不算陈旧的事实。1979年初，中国社会科学院决定编写《中国少数民族文学》，云南民族学院的两位副教授接受了编写阿昌族文学概况的任务，可是他们查遍了全国的文艺刊物，既未发现阿昌族的作家文学也不见阿昌族的民间文学作品。他们的工作只好从田野作业开始。
    阿昌族有本民族语言，无本民族文字，丰富的民族文化仅靠口耳相传。多少年来，由于社会生活的急剧变化，外来文化的强烈冲击，人为的摧残，致使阿昌族古老的传统文化濒临失传。解放后，阿昌族人民和全国各族人民一道在政治上翻了身，当家作了主人，但在文化建设上虽做了一些工作，却建树不大。
    当文学概况调查组来到阿昌山寨时，一位阿昌族老干部动情地说：“解放至今，银幕上没有阿昌人的形象，广播里没有阿昌人的声音，舞台上没有阿昌人的音乐，作品里没有阿昌人的生活，我们的文化还是一张白纸呵！”
    从这年开始，阿昌族的民族文化受到了重视。
    阿昌族聚居的云南德宏傣族景颇族自治州梁河、陇川两县县委专门组织了阿昌族民间文学调查组，有关部门也派专家来帮助工作。他们从村寨开始，找歌手，请“活袍”（经师），抢救搜集阿昌族的民间文学艺术，发现许多宝贵的民族文化遗产和民族民间文艺作品。如已翻译整理出的、长达两千多行的神话史诗《遮帕麻和遮米麻》，是研究阿昌族古代文学、哲学、美学、社会思想的重要资料。集阿昌族诗、歌、舞三位一体的文学艺术表现形式“窝罗”被发掘后，很快成为全民族喜爱的娱乐活动。根据阿昌族人民的意愿和《中华人民共和国宪法》第四条的规定，1983年4月德宏州第八届人民代表大会将窝罗节定为阿昌族的传统节日。
    近几年来，民族文学的调查整理更是硕果满枝，中央、省、市的一些刊物上陆续发表了阿昌族民间文学艺术作品数百件。1983年9月，德宏州民族出版社出版了《阿昌族文学作品选》。1985年，国家民委主持编纂的五种丛书中，《阿昌族简史》、《阿昌族语言简志》也相继出版。
    1985年云南电视台拍摄的三集民族风情专题片《阿昌风情》荣获第三届全国优秀电视专栏节目二等奖之后，又参加了1988年英国伦敦国际电视周的文化交流。
    随着阿昌族地区教育事业的发展，在阿昌族中涌现出一批作家，他们笔下的诗歌、散文、小说、报告文学、剧本见诸中央、省、市及地、州刊物，有的还在全国、全省获奖。
