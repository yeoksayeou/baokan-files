Author: Cheng Dian, Qing Hu, Ai Tian

Edition: 8

Miao Fenglin's "Chinese Official Literature" (published by Shandong People's Publishing House in 1988) is a comprehensive work on official literature. The author, drawing from extensive experience in clerical work and research, provides a relatively comprehensive discussion on the history of Chinese official documents, the evolution of their styles, current official document formats, the handling and rhetoric of official documents, and the cultivation of writing skills. The book is divided into five volumes and fifty-seven chapters, totaling 240,000 characters.

Official documents, in a country renowned for its literary prowess, have a history of several thousand years. Archaeologists refer to what is known as "oracle bone inscriptions" as the most primitive form of official documents, indicating that official documents emerged with the advent of written records.

Entering the 1980s, the construction of official documents in China's party and government organs faced the challenges of adapting to economic and political system reforms and embracing the modernization of office technology. Maximizing the efficiency of official document transmission and better serving the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics have become the demands of the times and the call of the reform tide. The publication of Miao Fenglin's "Chinese Official Literature" will have a positive impact on promoting China's modernization.

Innovative ideas and new content are prominent features of this book. The book is well-structured and theoretically robust. The author draws on the essence of both ancient and modern official documents, standing on the great momentum of China's reform, and extensively references and verifies, starting from "a peculiar phenomenon in literary history" to explore new discussions on the research objects, purposes, and methods of official literature.

Broad knowledge is the second distinctive feature of this book. The book cites a wealth of historical materials spanning several thousand years, selecting the most apt examples from vast classical works such as oracle bone inscriptions, "The Book of Documents," and "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons" to weave together the author's observations and thoughts. Each chapter and even each paragraph is compared and supported with evidence, expanding the reader's horizon and broadening their thinking.

Timeliness and practicality are the third distinctive features of this book. Since the founding of New China, with the needs of economic and cultural construction, there has been a demand for a systematic and comprehensive theoretical book to guide this specialized field in terms of official document formats and the construction of the official document workforce. "Chinese Official Literature" timely provides us with a relatively complete, high-level, and practically valuable textbook.

    ——读《中国公文学》
    承典　庆沪　艾田
    苗枫林著的《中国公文学》（齐鲁书社1988年出版）是一部内容宏富的公文学工具书。作者以长期从事案牍工作和研究的经验，对中国公文的历史，文体演变，现行公文体式，公文的运局和修辞，撰拟修养等作了较全面的论述，全书共五编五十七章，二十四万字。
    公文，在被誉为文章大国的中国，已有数千年历史，考古学家称作“甲骨文书”的，就是最原始的公文形式，可见有了文字记载就有公文。
    进入20世纪80年代，我国党政机关的公文建设，面临着适应经济、政治体制改革和迎接办公技术现代化的挑战。最大限度地提高公文传递效率、更好地为建设有中国特色的社会主义事业服务，已成为时代的要求、改革大潮的呼唤。苗枫林同志的《中国公文学》问世将对推动我国的现代化建设发生积极的影响。
    立意新、内容新，是这本书的一个显著特点，本书提纲挈领，理论性强。作者汲取古今公文精粹，立足中国改革大势，旁引博证，“从文学史的一个奇异现象提起”对公文学的研究对象、公文学研究的目的和方法进行了新探讨。
    知识广博是这本书的第二个特点。本书引证的大量史料上下几千年，从甲骨文、《尚书》、《文心雕龙》等浩如烟海的典籍里，遴选出最精当的例子来熔铸交织自己的观察与思考，为每一篇章乃至段落对比佐证，扩大读者的视野，开拓读者的思路。
    及时和实用是这本书的第三个特点。新中国成立后，随着经济文化建设的需要，在公文程式和公文工作的队伍建设方面，需要有一本能系统全面地指导这一专门学科的理论书籍。《中国公文学》及时为我们提供了一部较完整的、高水平的、有实用价值的教材。
