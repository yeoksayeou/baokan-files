Why is there a gap between the actual effects and the expected goals of poverty alleviation funds? Through an investigation and analysis of poverty alleviation work in our county, it was found that the main factors leading to the poor effectiveness of poverty alleviation funds are:

The low educational level of impoverished households. According to a survey of 100 households in the county, in 1988, 48 households had a per capita net income of less than 250 yuan. Among these, 57% were illiterate or semi-illiterate, and 43% had primary or junior high school education. After receiving the poverty alleviation funds, these households regarded them as government aid for the poor and converted the funds into consumption needs.

The method of distributing poverty alleviation funds is to allocate funds to each household based on their poverty situation. The "cake" received by the poor can be as much as several hundred yuan or as little as a dozen yuan. Due to the scattered distribution of funds, it objectively induces households to convert poverty alleviation funds into consumption funds, making it difficult for the funds to achieve their intended effects.

Excessive administrative intervention. In some places, the government approves poverty alleviation projects without thorough verification, and determines projects without taking any economic responsibility. Banks are merely the government's cashiers, having little influence on the direction of poverty alleviation funds, and the phenomenon of issuing loans based on relationships is rampant.

How can the potential of poverty alleviation funds be fully released?

One approach is for impoverished regions to collaborate with developed regions to develop local resources. Impoverished regions have relatively abundant natural resources, cheap labor, and a certain amount of poverty alleviation funds, but lack talent and technology. Developed regions, on the other hand, have a concentration of talent, advanced technology, and timely information, but lack funds and resources. Therefore, impoverished regions should open their doors, adopt preferential policies, and horizontally collaborate with developed regions to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and achieve coordinated development.

Another approach is to create a good environment for impoverished households to escape poverty. The local government should invest funds in transportation, reducing the distance between impoverished regions and other areas, and accelerating the transmission of scientific and technological, economic, and cultural information; invest in agricultural water conservancy projects, reducing or mitigating the losses caused by natural disasters; invest in education, improving the quality of the population, and enabling farmers to adapt to market changes, capture market information, and accept scientific and technological knowledge; invest in electricity, creating energy conditions for the application of modern technology.

A third approach is to use poverty alleviation funds to establish various service organizations, providing targeted pre-production, in-production, and post-production services for households based on the causes of their poverty. For example, if impoverished households lack production technology, service organizations can provide them with technical services.

### 改革农村扶贫工作

    改革农村扶贫工作
    扶贫资金使用的实际效果为什么与预期目标有差距？通过对我县扶贫工作的调查分析，发现导致扶贫资金使用效益差的主要因素是：
    贫困户文化程度低。据对全县100户农民定点调查，1988年人均纯收入在250元以下的有48户，其中，文盲、半文盲占57％，小学、初中文化程度的占43％。这些扶贫户拿到扶贫资金以后，他们视作政府对“穷人”的救济，把扶贫资金转化成了消费需求。
    扶贫资金发放办法，是根据贫困户的贫困情况，将资金按户切块使用。贫困者切得的“馅饼”多则上百元，少则十几元。由于资金分散，客观上诱发了农户将扶贫资金转化为消费基金，扶贫资金难以发挥效益。
    行政干预过大。一些地方政府上扶贫项目不经过严密的论证，定项目却不负任何经济责任。银行只是政府的出纳，对扶贫资金投向的影响甚微，发放关系贷款的现象不胜枚举。
    怎样使扶贫资金的潜能充分释放出来呢？
    思路之一，由贫困地区与发达地区联合开发本地资源。贫困地区自然资源相对丰富，劳动力廉价，又有一定数量的扶贫资金，就是缺乏人才和技术。而发达地区人才密集，技术先进，信息灵通，资金、资源则显不足。因此，贫困地区应该敞开大门，采取优惠政策，和发达地区横向联合，以扬长避短，优势互补，协调发展。
    思路之二，为贫困户创造良好的脱贫环境。当地政府把资金投入交通运输业，缩短贫困地区与外地的距离，加快科学技术、经济文化信息的传递速度；把资金投向农田水利建设，使农户免遭或减轻自然灾害的损失；把资金投向教育，提高人口素质，使农民具有适应市场变化，捕捉市场信息和接受科技知识的能力；把资金投向电力，为现代技术的应用创造能源条件。
    思路之三，利用扶贫资金成立各种服务性组织，针对农户贫困的原因，提供有针对性的产前、产中、产后服务。比如，如果贫困户因为缺乏生产技术，服务组织就可以为其提供技术服务。
