The construction of the Qinghe Diversion Project to bring water from the Qinghe River to Qin Huangdao City in Hebei Province has officially begun. Currently, more than ten thousand soldiers and civilians in the city are braving the cold to excavate trenches, lay pipes, drill tunnels, and build culverts. The project is progressing smoothly. From October 1 to November 20, 35% of the total earth and stone excavation task has been completed, 10% of the tunnel excavation has been completed, and 15 kilometers of pipes have been laid, which is one-third of the total length.

Qin Huangdao City's industrial and domestic water supply mainly relies on the Shihe Reservoir and groundwater extracted from 10 to 20 meters below the surface. During dry years, the city's water supply is insufficient. Over-extraction of groundwater has led to a sharp drop in water levels, causing seawater intrusion and water quality deterioration. However, the Qinghe River, which flows through the northern part of Qinglong Manchu Autonomous County, has an annual runoff of 9.4 billion cubic meters, with billions of cubic meters of fresh water flowing into the sea every year.

Comrades Wan Li and Tian Jiyun have paid close attention to the construction of the Qinghe Diversion Project. Wan Li specially listened to the report on the Qinghe Diversion Project by Hebei Provincial Party Secretary Qíng Chōngzhì and Qin Huangdao City Mayor Dīng Wénbīn, and said that this "practical matter" should be done well. The Hebei Provincial People's Government, in addition to studying this project in depth, has also provided support in terms of materials and funds, allocating 30 million yuan in special funds. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Qin Huangdao City, relevant national and provincial units, and the broad masses of cadres and people in the city have all actively contributed money and materials to support the construction of the project. As of November 23, the city has raised over 6 million yuan for the project.

　　引青济秦工程动工
    本报石家庄11月29日电　新华社记者余富棠、本报记者陆培法报道：引青龙河水入河北省秦皇岛市的引青济秦工程，现已全面动工。目前，全市一万多军民正冒着严寒，抓紧开挖深沟，埋设管道；打凿隧洞，修筑暗涵，工程进展顺利。从10月1日至11月20日，已完成总土石方任务的35％，隧洞掘进完成总工程量的10％，埋设管道15公里，占总长度的1／3。
    秦皇岛市的生产、生活用水，主要靠石河水库的水和开采本地区10至20米深处地下水。遇枯水年份，城市供水不足。超量开采地下水，水位骤降，造成海水倒灌，水质恶化。而流经这个市北部青龙满族自治县境内的青龙河水，年径流量达9.4亿立方米，每年却有数亿立方米的淡水白白流入大海。
    万里、田纪云同志十分关注引青济秦工程的建设，万里专门听取了河北省委书记邢崇智和秦皇岛市市长丁文斌关于引青济秦工程汇报，并说要把这件“实实在在的实事办好”。河北省人民政府除专题研究这项工程外，还从物资、资金等方面给予支援，已拨出3000万元专款。驻秦皇岛市的人民解放军、国家和省级有关单位，全市广大干部群众都积极出钱出物，支持工程建设。截至11月23日，全市为工程捐款超过600万元。
