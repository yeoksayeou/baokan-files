The great changes in today's Lan Kiao can comfort the spirits of the martyrs. However, the officials and people of Lan Kiao will forever remember this historical lesson: abandoning the essence of Jiao Yulu's spirit, even if the slogan of learning is shouted loudly, it is empty.

In the past, the "three evils" of wind, salt, and floods on the land of Lan Kiao, as well as the poverty of the people of Lan Kiao, became famous in the propaganda of Jiao Yulu's deeds. In the past, Jiao Yulu exhausted his blood to control the "three evils" and alleviate the poverty of the people of Lan Kiao. Today, the fundamental change that can comfort the spirits of the martyrs in Lan Kiao is: the "three evils" have been basically controlled, the problem of food and clothing for 600,000 people has been solved, and they have begun to walk the path to prosperity.

The achievements of Lan Kiao are inspiring: the sand dunes of the past have been locked by dense forests, more than 100,000 mu of barren land that was difficult for grass and trees to grow has been transformed into a cotton production base, and 280,000 mu of low-lying wasteland that was prone to flooding has been transformed into drought-resistant and flood-resistant fertile fields. The statistics for 1988 show: the total social output value of the county is 640 million yuan, the total industrial and agricultural output value is 490 million yuan, the per capita national income is 575 yuan, and the per capita grain is over 300 jin. The township enterprises, which mainly process economic crops, have developed rapidly, with a production value of 324 million yuan last year. In the county, 98% of rural households have built new tile-roofed houses, and 30% of households have televisions.

If asked why such achievements have been made, the officials of Lan Kiao have one answer: "Under the inspiration of Jiao Yulu's spirit." However, to make Jiao Yulu's spirit the true wealth that changes the face of Lan Kiao, the officials and people of Lan Kiao have experienced more than ten years of hardships and paid a heavy price. Zhou Chang'an, the director of the Propaganda Department of Lan Kiao County Committee, recalls this history with deep emotion: Not long after Jiao Yulu's death, the "Ten Years of Turmoil" began. The slogan of learning from Jiao Yulu was shouted louder and louder, the memorial activities were held more and more grandly, and Jiao Yulu's tomb was built bigger and bigger. However, the cause of controlling the "three evils" for which Comrade Jiao Yulu fought was abandoned, "Paulownia trees fell to the ground, jujube trees were uprooted, peanuts were extinct, sandstorms returned, salt-alkali returned, and fields were barren." According to the statistics of 1978, the per capita annual distribution was only 34 yuan, 95% of the villages and teams relied on loans for production, food relied on rationing, and money relied on relief. Every spring, one could see Lan Kiao people begging for food everywhere.

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Jiao Yulu's spirit returned to the Central Plains, and the people of Lan Kiao saw the image of Comrade Jiao from the officials who implemented the Party's policy of enriching the people and led the people to control the "three evils."

"Learning from Jiao Yulu, we cannot engage in formalism and empty rhetoric again, but must learn the essence of Jiao Yulu's spirit." After the "Ten Years of Turmoil," the first county committee secretary of Lan Kiao, Xian Wen, required all Party members and cadres in the county to face reality and use practical actions to help the people get rid of poverty, truly control the "three evils," and change the face. By combining the Party's policies with the interests of the people, Lan Kiao took the first step in the province to implement the responsibility system for production.

In 1980, Lan Kiao ended the history of eating rationed grain. The people of Lan Kiao, who had initially eaten steamed buns, demanded the improvement of the contract responsibility system and the control of the "three evils." This heavy responsibility fell on the shoulders of the new county committee leaders. Wang Zude, the comrade who heard Jiao Yulu's last wish, took office as the county committee secretary and conducted in-depth investigations and research. He implemented the contract responsibility system for economic crops such as trees, "land rights are fixed, tree roots are fixed, and people's minds are fixed," making Lan Kiao's forestry develop rapidly and forming a new pattern of agricultural and forestry integration with lush forests and abundant grain. The current county committee secretary, Xu Zongli, took office in 1987, but the weather was not favorable, with continuous droughts. After taking office, Xu Zongli focused on water conservancy projects. After more than two years of diverting the Yellow River for irrigation and well irrigation, the total effective irrigated area of the county reached 70%, laying a stable foundation for the development of agricultural production.

Over the past ten years, on the Central Plains where Jiao Yulu fought, the successors have felt a clear pressure: how to truly change the face of Lan Kiao. The younger generation who were deeply influenced by Jiao Yulu's spirit at that time have now taken up leadership positions. Several county committee secretaries who accepted our interviews all had a common belief: to bring benefits to the people.

Zhang Zhongzhou, the county committee secretary of Kaifeng, said: "As a cadre, one must do practical things for the people." He was the first secretary of the party branch in Yangshan Village, Lan Kiao, to implement the contract responsibility system. After being transferred to Kaifeng County in 1984, he also brought the spirit of controlling the "three evils" in Lan Kiao. Through detailed investigations and research, he found the main contradiction in Kaifeng County's grain production, which had been stagnant for many years: lack of water. After discussions by the county committee and the county government, it was decided to "divert water from the north to the south." The officials of Kaifeng County said that Zhang Zhongzhou's greatest characteristic is daring to do, knowing how to do, and leading by example. Many cadres and the masses can describe the scene of Zhang Zhongzhou, who did not leave the construction site for five days and five nights at a critical moment in the Yellow River diversion project, with torn trousers and a hoarse throat, and can count the practical things he led the county committee to do for Kaifeng County. In four years, Kaifeng County's grain production increased by one-tenth each year, and per capita income and fiscal revenue doubled.

Wang Fuguang, the county committee secretary of Changyuan, said: "As long as one is a leader, one must be prepared to suffer a loss." When he served as the county magistrate and county committee secretary of Changyuan, his wife was transferred from Huaxian to Changyuan for work. Wang Fuguang gave her three rules: she could not transfer to a regular position, she could not enter the government office, and she could not become a state-owned worker. Now she is still a collective worker in the county cotton and hemp company, doing cotton procurement work. His father had a disease that needed surgery in Xinxiang City, and he was sent there in a public car. The next day, he reimbursed 120 yuan for the car use. One of his relatives, after being transferred from the army, was assigned to the county grain bureau. He found out and immediately ordered the relevant departments to transfer him to a collective enterprise. During his five years as county magistrate and secretary, Wang Fuguang did not arrange for a single relative in violation of policies, did not issue a single note for personal matters, and did not make a single phone call. Wang Fuguang strictly disciplines himself, leading the county committee to be honest and upright, and work hard to build a new Changyuan that is rich in grain and trees, developed in commodity economy, and full of vitality.

Li Yutang, the county committee secretary of Tongxu, said: "To win the trust of the people, one must adhere to party principles and dare to be firm." In the summer of 1985, Li Yutang took office in Tongxu County. At the first meeting, he clearly announced: "As long as it is illegal and disorderly, no matter who it is, he will be removed from his post on the spot!" He said what he did. A township party committee secretary who worked in the morning, drank in the afternoon, and played mahjong at night was removed from his post. The deputy secretary in charge of the county discipline inspection commission, whose wife forged a medical certificate to reimburse expenses at the unit, interfered with the investigation and handling of the case, and was not only removed from his post but also received a warning punishment. This shook the whole county. Now, under the efforts of the broad cadres and the masses, the face of Tongxu has changed greatly!

Comrade Jiao Yulu left behind the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly. Today, what our cadres need to inherit and carry forward is also this spirit. Only by implementing the Party's line, principles, and policies in practice, keeping the people in mind at all times, and always thinking about what we should do for the people and what we have done, can we lead the people and accelerate the pace of socialist construction.

May there be many Jiao Yulu-style cadres in the vast rural areas and on the land of the motherland!

    焦裕禄精神在中原大地上
    本报记者　李杰　李而亮
    今日兰考的巨变，已经可以告慰烈士英灵。然而，兰考的干部群众永远记住了这样一个历史教训：丢弃了焦裕禄精神的实质，即使学习的口号喊得再响，也是空的。
    当年，兰考大地上的风沙、盐碱、洪涝“三害”和兰考人民的贫苦，也在焦裕禄事迹的宣传中出了名。昔日，焦裕禄为治住“三害”，解除兰考人民的贫困倾尽了自己的热血。今天，兰考可告慰烈士英灵根本变化的标志是：“三害”已基本治住，60万人民的温饱问题已解决，开始走上富裕之路。
    兰考取得的成就是令人鼓舞的：当年的风口沙丘，已被成片连网的林木锁住，10多万亩草木难长的盐碱地，已变成了棉花生产基地，28万亩低洼易涝的荒滩，变成了旱涝保收的良田。1988年的统计数字显示：全县社会总产值6.4亿元，工农业总产值4.9亿元，人均国民收入575元，人均粮食300多公斤。以加工经济作物为主的乡镇企业迅速发展，去年产值达3.24亿元。全县98％农家盖起了新瓦房，30％的农户有了电视机。
    要问为什么能取得这样的成就，兰考干部的回答中有一条，就是：“在焦裕禄精神的激励下。”但是，为使焦裕禄精神成为改变兰考面貌的真正财富，兰考的干部和群众经历过十多年的坎坷，付出了沉重的代价。兰考县委宣传部长周长安回忆起这段历史感慨万分：焦裕禄逝世后不久就是“十年动乱”，向焦裕禄学习的口号越喊越响，纪念活动越搞越大，焦裕禄的陵墓越修越大。可焦裕禄同志为之奋斗的治理“三害”事业被丢在一边，“泡桐倒地，大枣断根，花生绝种，风沙重起，盐碱回升，田地荒芜”。据1978年的统计，年人均分配仅34元，95％的村队生产靠贷款，吃饭靠统销，花钱靠救济。每年春季，到处可见外出讨饭的兰考人。
    十一届三中全会后，焦裕禄精神重新回到中原大地，兰考人民从干部切实落实党的富民政策、带领群众治理“三害”上看到了焦书记当年的形象。
    “学习焦裕禄，不能再搞花架子，形式主义，要学焦裕禄的精神实质。”“十年动乱”后兰考第一任县委书记刁文同志要求全县党员干部面向实际，用实际行动来使群众摆脱贫困，真正根治“三害”，改变面貌。把党的政策与群众利益紧密结合起来，兰考在全省最早迈出了联产承包责任制的一步。1980年兰考结束了吃统销粮的历史。
    初步吃上了白馍的兰考群众，要求完善承包，根治“三害”，这个重任落在接任的县委领导肩上。王祖德，这位听过焦裕禄同志最后遗愿的同志，担任县委书记后，深入调查研究，实行林木等经济作物的承包，“地定权，树定根，人定心”，使兰考林业有了迅速发展，形成了农林结合，林茂粮丰的新格局。现任县委书记徐宗礼，1987年接任后天不作美，连年大旱。徐宗礼上任后，把劲使在兴修水利上。经过二年多的引黄治水，挖井灌溉，使全县土地总有效灌溉面积达到70％，为农业生产发展打下了稳定基础。
    十年来，在焦裕禄奋斗过的中原大地上，接任干部都感到一种明显的压力：如何切实改变兰考面貌。当年深受焦裕禄精神教育的年青一代，如今不少人走上了领导岗位。接受我们采访的几位县委书记都有一个共同的信念：为人民造福。
    开封县委书记张中周说：“当上这干部，就要为群众办实事。”他就是那位当年在兰考杨山寨村第一个实行承包责任制的支部书记。1984年调开封县后，也带来了焦裕禄在兰考治“三害”的劲头。通过详细的调查研究，他找到了开封县粮食生产多年徘徊的主要矛盾：缺水。经过县委、县政府讨论，决定“北水南调”。开封县的干部说，张中周最大的特点是敢干、会干、带头干。许多干部群众，都能描述出张中周在引黄工程关键时刻，5天5夜不下工地，裤子撕烂，喉咙嘶哑仍不歇劲的情景，能数得出他带领县委一班人，为开封县办的实事。4年间，开封县粮食产量每年增一成，人均收入、财政收入翻了番。
    长垣县委书记王富均说：“只要当领导，就要准备吃亏。”他担任长垣县县长、县委书记，他的妻子从滑县调来长垣工作，王富均给她约法三章：一不能转干，二不能进机关，三不能当全民工。现在她一直是县棉麻公司的集体工，干收购棉花工作。他的父亲有病需要到新乡市动手术，用公车送去。他第二天就补交了120元用车费。他的一个亲戚，部队转业后安排到了县粮食局机关，他得知后，立即责令有关部门将其改派到集体企业去。当县长和书记五年间，王富均没有违背政策安排过一个亲属，没有为个人事情批过一个条子，打过一个招呼。王富均严以律己，率领县委一班人廉洁奉公，艰苦创业。一个贫穷落后的黄河滩区县，现在已变成粮丰林茂，商品经济发达，生机勃勃的新长垣。
    通许县委书记李玉堂说：“要取信于民，就要坚持党性原则，敢碰硬。”1985年夏，李玉堂到通许县上任，第一次开会就明确宣布：“只要是违法乱纪，不管是谁，就地免职！”他说到做到，一个“上午工作、下午吃喝、晚上乱摸（打麻将）”的乡党委书记被撤了职。县纪律检查委员会主持工作的副书记，其爱人开假医药证明回单位报销，他出面干扰查处工作，不仅被撤职，还受到了警告处分。这一下，震动了全县。如今在广大干部群众的努力奋斗下，通许面貌大变！
    当年焦裕禄同志留下了全心全意为人民服务的精神，今天我们的干部要继承和发扬光大的，也是这种精神。只有把党的路线、方针、政策贯彻到实际中去，心中时刻装着群众，时刻想着我们应该为人民作些什么，作了些什么，才能带领群众，加快社会主义建设步伐。
    愿众多焦裕禄式的干部出现在广大农村，出现在祖国大地上！
