East German swimming star Christine Otto announced yesterday that she has decided to retire from sports and end her swimming career.

Otto made this announcement during an interview with a reporter from the "Junge Welt" newspaper. When explaining her reasons for this decision, she said that during the recent European Championships held in Bonn, she realized that she had reached her peak performance and could no longer achieve better results. Therefore, she decided to retire while she was still at the top, although she was very attached to competitive sports. Otto expressed her intention to pursue a career in journalism in the future.

Otto won six gold medals at the Seoul Olympics. Additionally, she has won seven world championships and eight European championships.

    民德游泳名将奥托退出体坛
    本报柏林11月18日电　民主德国游泳名将克里斯廷·奥托昨天表示，她已决定退出体坛，结束游泳运动生涯。
    奥托是在接受《青年世界报》记者采访时作这一番表示的。她在解释作出这一决定的理由时说，她在不久前在波恩举行的欧洲冠军赛上觉察到，她已达到成绩的极限，不可能再创造更好的成绩了，因而决心急流勇退，虽然她十分留恋竞技体育运动。奥托表示，今后她有志于从事新闻工作。
    奥托在汉城奥运会上曾一人独得6枚金牌，此外，她还得过7次世界冠军、8次欧洲冠军。　（王怡）
