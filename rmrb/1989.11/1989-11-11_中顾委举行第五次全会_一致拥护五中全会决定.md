The fifth plenary session of the Central Advisory Commission of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing on November 10, 1989. The session was attended by 183 members.

The session was presided over by Vice Chairman Song Renqiong, and Vice Chairman Bo Yibo delivered an important speech.

The session fully endorsed the decision made by the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, "The Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Rectification and Deepening of Reform." The session believed that the decision scientifically analyzed the current economic situation, deeply summarized the experience of economic work, realistically assessed the difficulties and favorable conditions, and correctly proposed measures to solve the problems. It is a Marxist document full of the spirit of seeking truth from facts. The session pointed out that after the decision was adopted, the key is to implement it resolutely. It is necessary to strengthen leadership and supervision. All levels of party organizations and all party members should firmly establish the guiding ideology of achieving long-term, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy, unify their thinking, unify their actions, strengthen organizational discipline, oppose localism and factionalism, overcome corruption, and unite and lead the masses to carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard work. Strive to achieve decisive victories in rectification and deepening of reform.

The session unanimously supported the decision of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee to approve Deng Xiaoping's resignation as Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China, and fully agreed with the high evaluation of Deng Xiaoping's outstanding achievements made by the Fifth Plenary Session. The session believed that over the past decades, Deng Xiaoping had made indelible historical contributions to the realization of national independence and the liberation of the Chinese people, both nationally and socially, to the founding of New China, and to the construction of Chinese socialism. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, he had led the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups in the country to make great contributions to opening up a new period of socialist development in China. He is the chief architect of the party's work, the army's work, economic construction, reform and opening up, and other undertakings. The basic theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics he proposed is a enrichment and development of Mao Zedong Thought under new historical conditions. For the long-term stability and prosperity of the party and the state, he resigned from his current position while still in good health, setting a personal example for the abolition of the lifelong tenure system for leading cadres. Deng Xiaoping is indeed an outstanding Marxist, a steadfast communist, an excellent proletarian revolutionary, statesman, and military strategist, and a long-tested leader of our party and state. All members expressed their determination to study Deng Xiaoping's works together with all party members, so that they can play a major guiding role in China's socialist modernization construction.

The session unanimously supported the decision of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee to appoint Jiang Zemin as Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China, Yang Shangkun as First Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Liu Huaqing as Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Yang Baibing as Secretary of the Central Military Commission, and to add Yang Baibing as a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee.

The session pointed out that since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, the work of the new central leadership with Jiang Zemin as the core has been highly effective, and the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups in the country are satisfied. Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to consciously maintain the centralized and unified leadership of the Central Committee and to do their best to support the Central Committee in its work.

The session called on all members of the Central Advisory Commission and all old cadres to strengthen their study of Marxist basic theory, first of all to seriously study Marxist philosophy, to improve their ideological and theoretical level, and together with all party members and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, to closely unite around the Central Committee, to adhere to the four cardinal principles, to oppose bourgeois liberalization, and to work together to overcome the difficulties ahead, to achieve the strategic goal of doubling the national income by the end of this century, and to continuously promote socialist modernization construction and socialist reform!
