It is well known that humans have four main blood types: O, A, B, and AB. Scientists have discovered that animals and plants also have blood types.

According to research by veterinarians, monkeys, apes, and humans share the same four blood types: O, A, B, and AB. Rats have A and B blood types. Herbivores, such as horses, cows, and deer, predominantly have O type blood, followed by A type, with B type being very rare. Carnivores, like lions, tigers, wolves, and leopards, have A, B, and O blood types. Ferocious tigers mostly have B type blood. Snakes have only A and B blood types, while frogs and mudskippers have A, B, and AB blood types. The blood type of an animal is also related to its personality. In a herd of horses, those that like to lead are mostly O type. When studying animal behavior and personality, or even observing their group dynamics, blood type is a factor worth considering.

A Japanese botanist has been exploring the blood types of plants. This botanist hypothesized that although plants do not have blood, they do have a liquid that functions similarly to human blood, antigens, and antibodies. Therefore, he used antibodies separated from human serum to test the blood types of hundreds of plants. The results aligned with his hypothesis. Over the years, he has tested 150 types of vegetables and fruits and found 19 different blood types. He also analyzed 500 types of plants systematically and found over 60 different blood types, but none of them were A type.

He discovered that kelp, apples, pumpkins, and peppers are O type; plums are AB type. Some plants, like potatoes and barley, do not have discernible blood types.

The classification of plant blood types is very helpful for scientific research in areas such as plant classification, cell fusion, and hybrid breeding.

    动植物血型趣话
    刘正生
    众所周知，人类的血型有O、A、B、AB四种主要类型。经科学家研究，动植物也有血型。
    据兽医界的研究，猴子、人猿和人类相同，也有O、A、B、AB四种血型。老鼠血型有A型和B型。食草兽类，如马、牛、鹿等，它们的血型以O型为最多，A型其次，B型非常少。食肉兽类，如狮、虎、狼、豹等，则有A、B、O三种血型。凶狠的老虎，血型多属B。蛇类仅有A、B两种血型，青蛙及山椒鱼有A、B、AB三种血型。动物血型和它们的个性也有一定的关系，马群中喜欢当领队的，以O型为多。研究动物的行为与“个性”甚至观察其群性，血型也是值得参考的要素。
    日本一位植物学家一直在探索植物的血型问题。这位植物学家设想，植物体内虽然没有血液，但却流通着与人体血液、抗原抗体等同样起作用的液体。因此，他利用人的血清分离出来的抗体，对几百种植物进行血型检验，检验结果同他的设想相符。多年来，他已对150种蔬菜、水果作了检验测定，发现共有19种血型；又对500种植物作了系统的分析测定，统计结果共60多种血型，但唯独没有A型。
    他发现，海带、苹果、南瓜、辣椒等为O型；李子等为AB型。也有的植物测不出血型，如土豆、大麦等。
    植物血型的区分，非常有助于植物的分类测定、细胞融合及品种杂交等方面的科学研究。
