Over the past decade, the total agricultural output value of the Shijiazhuang region has increased by 132%. The average yield per acre of the hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland in the region has increased from over 200 kilograms to over 600 kilograms. How has the Shijiazhuang region achieved stable and high agricultural production? Let's take a look.

Science and Technology Plus Investment

A yield of 640 kilograms of grain per acre! Just after the autumn harvest, the Shijiazhuang region of Hebei Province reported another bumper harvest in agriculture.

Since the early 1970s, China's agriculture has experienced many ups and downs. However, this traditional agricultural region of Shijiazhuang has stood out. Especially in the past 10 years, the total agricultural output value has increased by 132%, and the total grain production has increased by 32.6%. The region's grain production has moved from an average of over 200 kilograms per acre to over 600 kilograms per acre. This year, despite natural disasters such as wind, hail, and drought, the grain yield and total production both reached record highs. Notably, this year also saw the emergence of Xingle, Wuxian, and Zhao County, where the autumn grain yield per acre exceeded 500 kilograms.

How has the Shijiazhuang region achieved stable and high agricultural production?

"High-Yield Varieties" Promote Breakthroughs

"Jimai 26," another high-yielding, disease-resistant, drought-resistant, and early-maturing new variety. This is the sixth large-scale replacement of wheat varieties in Shijiazhuang since liberation. Before 1978, the average replacement cycle was once every 10 years, but in the past 10 years, it has been shortened to an average of once every 3 years. The faster the replacement cycle, the higher the increase in yield. With the same water, fertilizer, and soil conditions, and the same management, "Jimai 26" can increase the yield per acre by 62.5 kilograms compared to ordinary varieties. What kind of increase in yield is this for the entire region's 4.1 million acres of wheat?

Regional Executive Director Fu Liang said: "We have always focused on seeds as the foundation for increasing grain production and have never let go. The area of high-yield varieties each year accounts for more than 80%." The region has not only established and improved a three-level seed system at the provincial, county, and township levels but has also established two seed breeding base counties. The direct seed breeding bases for wheat at the provincial and county levels alone cover 330,000 acres, which can basically meet the self-sufficiency needs.

A single high-yield seed brings not only the information of scientific and technological increase in production but also sparks a revolution in modern science and technology in traditional planting.

In the past, farmers planted wheat, from sowing to harvesting, at least four or five times of irrigation, more than seven or eight times, even up to ten times, to get a yield of 200 to 300 kilograms per acre. Today, however, few people follow this "conventional" practice. What is advocated is formula fertilization, watering prediction, and model planting. Since 1985, the region's scientific and technological personnel have begun to explore the prediction and forecasting of winter wheat irrigation based on the experimental research of the water demand and watering rules of winter wheat. They attempt to report to farmers in advance, like weather forecasting, the amount of water and time needed for winter wheat in each growth period, to achieve the goal of high yield and water-saving for winter wheat. Now this achievement is being promoted on a large scale throughout the region. The result of irrigation prediction for more than 3.7 million acres of winter wheat is that compared with the previous "normal" irrigation, 698 million cubic meters of water, 10,394 tons of oil, and 37.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity have been saved, and an average of only three or four times of irrigation can get 350-400 kilograms per acre.

"Increasing in summer and decreasing in autumn" is an old problem in northern grain-producing areas. However, the Shijiazhuang region, driven by scientific and technological progress, has broken through this dilemma and explored a new high-yield path by accelerating the renewal and replacement of early-maturing corn hybrid varieties. Since 1980, the region's corn yield has increased year by year, reaching over 330 kilograms in the past two years.

Numbers are dry, but behind each set of dry numbers lies the enormous vitality of scientific and technological increase in production. Last year alone, the promotion and application of 14 new agricultural technologies in this region increased grain production by 290 million kilograms, accounting for 46% of the total increase that year. The seeds of scientific and technological agriculture have deeply rooted in this land. More than a thousand scientific and technological personnel have gone down to the fields to take on contracts. Tens of thousands of rural scientific and technological demonstration households have emerged, forming multi-level and multi-type agricultural technology markets, and constructing 2 million acres of high-yield and even higher-yield demonstration fields... Continuously breaking through the traditional thinking of agriculture and opening up new paths for increased production.

Efforts Outside Agriculture

Shortages of fertilizer, oil, and electricity! In recent years, such anxious cries can be heard in many places.

Can the Shijiazhuang region avoid this? It is hard to believe. In the 1970s, this region began to vigorously promote the production of small inorganic fertilizers such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Although there was a tendency to rush in, it indeed laid a relatively solid foundation for the subsequent agricultural fertilizer industry. In the 1980s, this region overcame two difficulties: the impact of imported fertilizers and the quality standardization of local fertilizers. In the situation where small fertilizer plants in other regions were closing down, this region retained 9 small nitrogen fertilizer plants and 6 small phosphorus fertilizer plants, producing more than 700,000 tons of ammonium bicarbonate and more than 300,000 tons of superphosphate annually. Therefore, while many regions in the country are facing fertilizer shortages, here the supply and demand are basically balanced.

The fertilizer industry has become an important pillar of agricultural production in the Shijiazhuang region. Gaocheng County, known as the "Grain General County," relies on the strength of the county-owned fertilizer plant to provide 50,000 tons of fertilizer annually at a price 10% to 20% lower than the market price, benefiting farmers by 2.5 million yuan. In addition, the region's agricultural machinery power has approached the national highest level of Shanghai—52.6 horsepower per 100 acres of cultivated land—thanks to the strong support of agricultural industries.

The stable and high yield of agriculture cannot be separated from the support of agricultural industries, and the transformation and added value of agriculture more rely on the development of agricultural and sideline product processing industries. The two complement each other and are indispensable. Especially in the past two years when the planting benefits of grain and cotton have been relatively low, the importance of strengthening the development of the latter has become even more prominent. After all, farmers cannot afford to lose money when planting crops, right?

What to do? A practical measure is to rely on local resources, develop our own agricultural and sideline product processing industries, and use the "post-natal" added value of the processing industry to make up for the "congenital" deficiencies of agriculture. In recent years, the Shijiazhuang region has developed more than 2,630 agricultural and sideline product processing enterprises using grain, cotton stalks, fruits, and livestock products as raw materials, with an annual output value of 450 million yuan. The region extracts 5.9 million yuan of agricultural subsidies from the added value of agricultural and sideline product processing each year. The cumulative amount in recent years is equivalent to the total amount of national investment in agriculture in this region during the same period.

    近十年，石家庄地区农业总产值增长百分之一百三十二；全区数百万亩耕地，平均亩产由二百多公斤增加到六百多公斤。石家庄地区农业如何走上稳产高产之路？请看——
　　科技加投入
　　王修民　任贤良
    粮食亩产640公斤！金秋刚过，河北省石家庄地区便传来农业又获丰收的喜讯。
    从70年代初至今，我国农业沉沉浮浮，经历了许多风风雨雨。但石家庄这一传统农区却脱颖而出。尤其是近10年，农业总产值增长了132％，粮食总产量增长32.6％。全区粮食产量从每亩平均200多公斤的中产行列，进入600公斤的高产行列。今年虽遭风、雹、干旱等自然灾害，粮食单产、总产均创历史最高水平。特别是今年还出现了新乐、无极、赵县三县秋粮亩产过500公斤的先进典型。
    石家庄地区农业是如何走上稳产高产之路的呢？
                “良种”促突破
    “冀麦26”，又一个丰产、抗病、抗旱、成熟期早的新品种。这，已是石家庄地区解放后小麦品种的第六次大面积更新换代。1978年以前，平均每10年一次，而最近10年缩短为平均每3年一次。换代频率加快，增产的幅度节节提高。一个“冀麦26”，同等的水、肥、土条件，同样的管理，就比一般品种的亩产高62.5公斤。全区410万亩小麦是一个怎样的增产数字？！
    地区行署专员傅亮介绍说：“我们始终把种子作为粮食增产的基础紧抓不放，每年的良种面积，都占到80％以上。”全区不仅建立健全了地、县、乡三级良种体系，还建立了两个良种繁殖基地县，仅地、县直接抓的小麦繁种基地就有33万亩，可基本自给自足。
    一粒良种带给人们的不仅仅是科技增产的信息，还由此裂变出现代科技对传统种植的革命。
    过去，农民种小麦，从种到收，最少要浇水四五次，多则七八次，上十次，才能拿到每亩二三百公斤的收成。而今，却很少有人再按此“常规”行事了。人们推崇的是配方施肥、预测浇水、模式化栽培。从1985年起，这一地区的科技人员在对冬小麦的灌溉需水量和需水规律试验研究基础上，开始对冬小麦的灌溉预测预报进行探索，试图像作天气预报那样，提前向农民报告冬小麦各生育期所需的灌水量和灌水时间，实现冬小麦高产省水的目的。如今这一成果，开始在全区大面积推行。370多万亩冬小麦预报灌溉的结果，比以往“正常”灌溉节水6.98亿立方米，节油10394吨，节电3770万千瓦小时，平均每亩只浇三四次就可拿到350—400公斤。
      “夏增秋减”，是北方产粮区的“老大难”。而石家庄地区却靠着科学技术的推动，走出这一困境，摸索出了一条以加快早熟玉米杂交品种更新换代的高产新路子，使全区玉米单产自1980年后，连年增产，最近两年达330多公斤。
    数字是枯燥的，而在每一组枯燥数字的背后，却又包含着科技增产的巨大活力。过去一年，这一地区仅14项农业增产新技术的推广应用，就使粮食增产2.9亿公斤，占当年累计增产总量的46％。科技兴农的种子已经深深根植于这片土地。上千名科技人员的下田承包。数万个农村科技示范户的出现，多层次、多类型的农业技术市场的形成，200万亩高产再高产示范田的建设……不断突破着人们对农业的传统思维定势，开辟出新的增产之路。
            功夫在农外
    缺肥，缺油，缺电！近两年在不少地方都能听到这种焦虑的呼喊。
    石家庄地区能否幸免呢？说来令人难于置信。70年代这一地区就开始大抓了小氮磷等无机肥的生产，当时县县搞小氮肥，社社上土磷肥，虽说有一哄而起之嫌，但确实对以后的农用化肥工业奠定了相对厚实的基础。80年代，这一地区又闯过进口化肥冲击和地方化肥质量达标两道难关，在其它地区小化肥厂纷纷倒闭的情况下，这一地区保住了9个小氮肥厂、6个小磷肥厂，年产碳铵70多万吨，过磷酸钙30多万吨，因而在全国许多地区化肥紧张之际，这里保持供求基本平衡。
    化肥工业成了石家庄地区农业生产的重要支柱。有“粮食元帅县”之称的藁城县，凭着县办化肥厂的实力，每年拿出5万吨化肥，以低于市场价10％到20％的价格，优惠供应农民，仅此一项就向农民让利250万元。此外，全区还由于农用工业的有力支持，农业机械动力已接近全国最高水平的上海市——每百亩耕地平均52.6马力。
    农业的稳产高产离不开农用工业的支持，农业的转化增值更有赖于农副产品加工业的发展。两者相辅相成，缺一不可。尤其在近两年粮棉种植效益较低的情况下，加强后者发展的重要性，就显得尤为突出。总不能让农民亏着本种地吧？
    怎么办？一个切实可行的措施，就是立足本地资源，发展自己的农副产品加工业，靠加工业的“后天”增值来弥补农业的“先天不足”。近几年，石家庄地区以粮食、棉花秸秆、果品、畜牧产品为原料的农副产品加工企业发展到2630多个，年产值4.5亿元。全区每年从农副产品加工增值中提取的补农资金就达590多万元，近年来累计总额相当于国家同期对这一地区农业投资的总和。
