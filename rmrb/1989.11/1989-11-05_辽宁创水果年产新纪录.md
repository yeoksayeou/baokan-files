Liaoning Sets New Record for Annual Fruit Production

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Shenyang on November 4, Liaoning Province, one of China's major fruit-producing regions, has overcome severe drought this year and achieved a new record in annual fruit production. It is reported that the province's total fruit production this year will reach 1.24 million tons, an increase of 20,000 tons over last year.

	Throughout this year, spring drought, summer drought, and autumn drought have occurred one after another, posing a threat to Liaoning's major fruit-producing areas. Liaoning has concentrated its efforts to organize manpower and resources to irrigate and combat the drought, ensuring that the fruit production in most of the major fruit-producing counties has remained stable and increased.
