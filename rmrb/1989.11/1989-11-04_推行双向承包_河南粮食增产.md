This year, Henan has implemented a two-way contracting responsibility system across the province. This system pushes various levels of leadership to the forefront of agricultural production, integrating power, financial resources, material resources, human resources, and intellectual resources. It has fostered a strong atmosphere of the entire Party and the entire nation working together on agriculture. It is reported that this year, Henan's total grain production has exceeded 30 billion kilograms for the first time, an increase of 3.5 billion kilograms compared to last year.

The agricultural two-way contracting responsibility system involves setting clear targets and responsibilities for each level from the county to the village to the household. Contracts are signed, and resources, technology, and funding services are provided from the top down. From the bottom up, production quotas, procurement tasks, and other economic indicators are contracted. A reward and punishment system is also established. Each summer and autumn, evaluations are conducted, and both parties review and assess the various service responsibilities and contracted tasks specified in the contract. Based on the evaluation results, rewards and punishments are implemented according to the contract, and payments are made on time.

This year, 15 prefecture-level cities and 86 counties in Henan have widely implemented the agricultural two-way contracting system. The main features and effects are as follows:

	* The government takes the lead in coordinating various functional departments and business units to provide services for agriculture, ensuring the foundation of the national economy.
	* Various levels of government ensure that national plans, farmer production, and market demand are organically combined, making government macro-planning decisions implemented in various service departments and households.
	* It promotes the transformation of officials' work styles, especially overcoming the past issues of unclear departmental responsibilities and mutual blame, ensuring that each department works together according to the two-way contracting targets, coordinates operations, and jointly contributes to agricultural development.
	* It mobilizes the enthusiasm of scientific and technological personnel, promoting the application and dissemination of agricultural science and technology.

Although Henan's total grain production has reached a historic high this year, due to the population increasing by 1 million each year, the per capita grain availability in the province is still 30 kilograms less than in 1984. This indicates that the grain production situation in Henan remains severe.

    推行双向承包  河南粮食增产
    本报郑州11月3日电　记者李杰报道：今年以来，河南在全省范围内推行农业双向承包责任制，把各级领导推向农业生产第一线，使权力、财力、物力、人力、智力融为一体，全省形成全党全民办农业的好风气。据悉，今年河南粮食总产量首次突破300亿公斤，比去年净增35亿公斤。
    农业双向承包责任制，就是围绕农业生产的各个项目，在县、乡、村、户之间，层层明确目标责任，签订合同，自上而下包农业生产资料供应和技术、资金服务，自下而上承包农业产量、定购任务和其它经济指标的完成，并制订奖惩制度，每年夏秋两季考评，由合同双方对合同中规定的各项服务责任和承包任务进行全面审核评定，根据考评结果，按合同规定进行奖惩，按时兑现。
    今年河南省有15个地市、86个县区普遍推行农业双向承包，主要特点和效果有：
    ——由政府出面，领导牵头，协调各职能部门和业务单位为农业提供服务，保证了农业这个国民经济的基础。
    ——各级政府保证了国家计划、农民生产和市场需求有机地结合，使政府的宏观计划决策在各服务部门和千家万户得到落实。
    ——促进了干部作风的转变，特别是克服了过去部门责任不清，互相扯皮的现象，从而保证各部门根据双向承包的目标相互配合、协调运行，共同为发展农业生产出力。
    ——调动了科技人员的积极性，促进了农业科学技术的推广应用。
    河南省粮食总产量虽说今年创造了历史最高水平，但由于人口现每年以100万的速度增长，致使全省人均占有粮食仍比1984年下降了30公斤。这说明，该省粮食生产形势依然是严峻的。
