Hydropower was once considered the cleanest and most ideal method of obtaining energy. However, in recent times, the Soviet Union has engaged in a debate regarding the advantages and disadvantages of hydropower.

The Soviet Union is a major hydropower nation, having built several large hydroelectric power stations. Unlike thermal power stations, hydroelectric power stations do not emit dense smoke and toxic substances. However, the dams raise the water level upstream, often submerging forests and farmland, forcing residents to relocate, and potentially altering the local environment and climate. This has led to dissatisfaction among ecologists and residents near the power stations. They demand the halt of large hydroelectric power station construction and the promotion of small hydroelectric power stations, renewable energy sources (solar, wind, tidal energy, etc.), and thermal power stations. According to Soviet publications, there are currently 35 hydroelectric and nuclear power stations under debate, with a total installed capacity of over 80 million kilowatts, accounting for one-quarter of the Soviet Union's current power generation capacity.

Under public pressure, some hydroelectric power stations have been forced to halt construction, while others have been delayed. Many power grids across the country are operating at overcapacity. *Pravda* has reported that during this winter's peak electricity demand, the country will face a shortfall of at least 6 million kilowatts in power generation capacity.

In this debate, those who oppose large hydroelectric power stations are almost all non-energy experts. Energy experts, however, unanimously agree that the construction of large hydroelectric power stations should continue. Their main reasons are as follows:

Firstly, under current technological conditions, hydroelectric power stations are safer than thermal power stations and have a lesser impact on the environment. Thermal power stations consume large amounts of mineral fuels and oxygen, releasing significant amounts of smoke, toxic substances, and carbon dioxide that contribute to the greenhouse effect. Moreover, statistics show that the rate of industrial accidents in thermal power stations is much higher than in hydroelectric power stations.

Secondly, large-scale development of renewable energy is currently not feasible. The Soviet Union's largest wind turbine has a capacity of only 10 kilowatts, and the world's largest wind turbine has a capacity of only 75 kilowatts. The largest solar power station in the Soviet Union, located on the Crimean Peninsula, has a capacity of only 5 kilowatts. Additionally, the use of renewable energy is much more expensive than traditional energy sources. For example, the cost of electricity from the Crimean solar power station is 26 rubles per kilowatt-hour, while the average cost in the Soviet Union is only 1.2 kopeks.

Thirdly, building a small hydroelectric power station does result in less forest and land being submerged. However, to achieve the same power generation capacity as a large hydroelectric power station, many small hydroelectric power stations would need to be built. The damage they cause to agriculture and the environment is far greater than that caused by a single large hydroelectric power station.

Therefore, energy experts believe that the issue of large hydroelectric power stations should be approached with caution, based on the country's actual situation. They point out that, regardless, electricity is essential. The country's power generation capacity must increase by 12 million kilowatts annually, as every 1 ruble increase in national income means an additional 3 kilowatt-hours of electricity must be generated. However, it is currently difficult to say whether the opinions of energy experts will prevail in this debate.

　　苏联关于水电利弊的讨论
　　胡锡进
    水力发电曾被认为是最干净、最理想的获取能源的方法。然而近一个时期，苏联围绕着水力发电的利与弊却展开了讨论。
    苏联是水力发电大国，建有一批大型水电站。水电站并不像热电站那样排放浓烟和有毒物质，但拦河坝提高了上游水位，往往会淹没不少森林和耕地，迫使居民搬迁，并可能改变局部地区的环境和气候，因而引起生态学家和电站周围居民的不满。他们要求停建大型水电站，改建小水电站，而代之以再生能源（太阳能、风能、潮汐能等）以及热电站。据苏联报刊报道，目前引起争议的水电站和核电站共有35座，总装机容量在8000万千瓦以上，占苏联现有发电能力的1／4。
    在舆论的压力下，有的水电站被迫停建，有的被延期。全国的许多电网都处于超负荷状态。《真理报》发表预计，今年冬天用电高峰时，全国至少短缺600万千瓦的发电能力。
    在这场讨论中，对大型水电站持反对态度的几乎都是非能源专家。而能源专家则一致认为应继续修建大型水电站。他们提出的理由主要有以下3点：
    第一，在目前的技术条件下，水电站比热电站安全，对生态的影响也较少。热电站需要消耗大量矿物燃料和氧气，同时释放出大量烟尘、有毒物质和引起温室效应的二氧化碳。而且，统计资料表明，热电站的工伤事故大大高于水电站。
    第二，大规模开发再生能源目前尚不现实。苏联现有的最大功率的风力发动机只有10千瓦，全世界最大功率的风力发动机也不过75千瓦；位于克里米亚半岛的全苏最大的太阳能发电站仅有5千瓦的发电能力。此外，使用再生能源比使用传统能源昂贵得多。如克里米亚太阳能电站每度电的成本高达26卢布，而全苏的平均成本只有1.2戈比。
    第三，修建一座小水电站，淹没的森林和土地的确少。但要获得与一座大型水电站相同的发电能力，就必须修建许多小水电站。它们对农业和生态造成的损失，远比修建一座大型水电站大得多。
    为此，能源专家认为，对于大型水电站的问题，应视国家的现实情况，采取慎重态度。他们指出，不管怎么说，不能没有电。必须保证全国的发电能力每年增加1200万千瓦，因为国民收入每增加1卢布，就意味着要多发3度电。然而，能源专家的意见能否在这场讨论中占上风，目前还很难说。
