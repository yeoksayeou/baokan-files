Eternity
Ge Haixia

I can't forget him.

At that time, I was working as a nurse in a hospital. He was admitted due to advanced lung cancer. The doctors had tried their best to save his life, but after opening his chest cavity during surgery, they found that the cancer cells had already spread, making surgery impossible. The doctors then helplessly stitched him up.

He was moved to the intensive care unit. I guarded him every day, watching him grow thinner and thinner.

One afternoon, he asked to go outside to see the scenery and breathe some fresh air. I pushed him out of the ward in a wheelchair. His frail body was wrapped in a thick cotton coat, leaning weakly on the wheelchair. I pushed him slowly along the concrete path. It was early spring, though still a bit chilly, but the breath of spring was already uncontrollably trembling in the air, coming with the gentle breeze. As we walked, he suddenly struggled to lift his head and made two weak, hoarse sounds, "Ah, ah." I stopped and followed his gaze. I saw the willow branches by the roadside had sprouted tiny buds, and the soft branches, laden with buds, were gently swaying in the breeze. "Ah, ah," he opened his mouth slightly, looking at the willow branches dancing in the wind, and struggled to make two more sounds. His eyes, filled with bloodshot and somewhat cloudy, were filled with longing, gradually turning into two bright tears that rolled down from his eye sockets, down his thin cheeks. In that moment, my heart felt like it had been struck by something powerful, and all the blood in my body seemed to freeze.

He left us in the spring. It was the season of rebirth, when grass and trees sprout new life.

His wife and daughter knelt by his bed, crying and lamenting how he had neglected his own health and never worried about the family's affairs, how he had devoted himself entirely to his work. They said he only knew work, work, and never enjoyed a single day of peace. They cried that he left too soon, that it was too unfair...

I stood silently by his bed. White, simple, and clear. Under the white sheet, he would never breathe again. But that weak yet persistent "ah, ah" sound, that slightly open mouth, those eyes full of longing, and those two bright tears, would forever stay in my heart. In that moment, I understood the meaning in his voice, understood the longing it held. He so wanted to return to life, to continue working for the cause he had fought for all his life. Only this longing gave his life meaning and made it eternal.

I felt a deep respect for this senior colleague. I went outside and picked two willow branches, placing them on his body. The buds on the branches had grown into new leaves, looking so green and fresh against the white sheet.

    永恒

    我忘不了他。
    那时我在医院当护士。他是因为晚期肺癌入院的。医生曾尽了最大的努力想挽救他的生命，手术切开胸腔后才发现，癌细胞早已扩散，无法施行手术了，医生又无可奈何地给他缝合。
    他被送进了特护病房。我每天守护在他身边，眼见着他一天天地消瘦下去。
    有一天下午，他要求到户外去看看，透透空气，我便用手推车推着他出了病房。他瘦弱的身体裹在厚厚的棉大衣里，无力地靠在轮椅上。我推着他在水泥小径上缓缓地走着，初春的天气，虽然还有些寒冷，但春的气息已经抑制不住地在空气中颤抖着，随着阵阵微风拂面而来。走着走着，他忽然费力地抬起头来，发出“啊、啊”两声微弱、沙哑的叫声。我停下了脚步，顺着他的目光望去，只见路边的柳枝上绽出了星星点点的芽苞，柔软的枝条载着满身的芽苞正在微风中轻松地摇曳着。“啊、啊”，他微张着嘴，望着在风中翩跹的柳枝又艰难地叫了两声，那双布满了血丝变得有些混浊的眼睛里充满了渴望，渐渐地，这渴望凝聚成了两颗晶亮的大泪珠从眼眶里滚了出来，顺着他消瘦的脸颊一直流下来。那一瞬间，我的心像被什么猛烈地撞击了一下，全身的血液都仿佛凝固住了。
    他是在春天里离去的。那是万物复苏、草木抽芽的季节，是生命诞生的季节。
    他的妻和他的女儿跪在他的床前哭喊着，同时一边哭诉着他是如何不顾惜自己的身体，不操心家里的一切事，又是如何全身心地扑到工作上。她们说他只知道工作、工作，却没有享过一天清福，她们哭他去得太早，太不应该……
    我在他的床前默默伫立。白色，简单、明了。白色被单覆盖下的他不再会呼吸。但那“啊、啊”的微弱却执拗的叫声，那微张的嘴唇，那双充满了渴望的眼睛，那两颗晶亮的大泪珠，却永远留在了我的心里。那一瞬间，我懂得了他声音里的含义，懂得了那满含的渴望，他多么想重新投入生活，为他终身奋斗的事业一直工作、工作。唯有这种渴望，才使生命有了意义，得到了永恒。
    我对这位前辈油然生起了敬意，我到外面去折了两条柳枝回来放到了他的身上。枝条上的芽苞已经长成了新叶，在白色被单的衬映下显得那么碧绿、那么鲜嫩。
