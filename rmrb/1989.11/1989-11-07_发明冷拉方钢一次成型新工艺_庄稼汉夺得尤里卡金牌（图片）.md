    Su Zhi'eng (leftmost), originally a farmer who worked with the land, is now the manager of Anlitun Cold-Drawn Steel Factory in Wen'an County, Hebei Province. Through years of production practice, he invented the "cold-drawn square steel one-time forming new process." At the 37th Brussels Eureka World Invention Expo, he won a gold medal. The new process for cold-drawn steel materials increases efficiency by 2-5 times and saves 50% of electricity. According to experts, adopting his cold-drawn new process can save the country 12 million tons of steel annually. Now he has also successfully developed new processes for hexagonal, triangular, and flat square shapes. The image shows Su Zhi'eng observing the process of drawing hexagonal steel.

    发明冷拉方钢一次成型新工艺
    庄稼汉夺得尤里卡金牌
    苏志英（左一），原是一名与土地打交道的庄稼汉，现在是河北省文安县安里屯冷拉钢厂厂长。他在多年的生产实践中，创造发明了“冷拉方钢一次成型新工艺”，在第37届布鲁塞尔尤里卡世界发明博览会上荣获金牌。冷拉钢材一次成型新工艺比传统工艺效率提高2—5倍，节电50％。据有关专家测算，采用他的冷拉新工艺，全国每年可节约钢材1200万吨。现在他又研制成功了六角形、三角形、扁方型冷拉新工艺。图为苏志英在观察拉制六角形钢材的工艺过程。本报记者  王景仁摄影报道
