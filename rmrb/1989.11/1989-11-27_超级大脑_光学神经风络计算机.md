Scientists say that in the 19th century, we solved the problem of using machines to reduce physical labor, in the 20th century, we solved the problem of using electronic devices to control machines, and by the 21st century, we will need to learn how to use information feedback to control machines with electronic devices. The sixth-generation computer will undertake this task.

Twenty years ago, the famous British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke described in his science fiction novel "Super Brain" a computer named "Hal" that independently operated a spaceship, monitored and participated in the management of the spaceship. It had the functions of a human brain, could think independently, and solve problems.

Today, due to the rapid progress in optical research, the scientific fantasies of the past are about to become a reality. Scientists are confident that the development of science and technology is approaching the creation of a computer similar to "Hal." It is predicted that by the beginning of the next century, this super brain computer will be used in spacecraft and various aerospace vehicles. The key to achieving this step lies in the development of optical neural network computers.

The Japanese call the neural network computer the sixth-generation computer, which is quite different from the classical digital computer. This super brain computer relies on optical fibers thinner than a hair to transmit information instead of metal wires or digital chips, with a speed reaching the speed of light. It can meet the requirements of algebraic operation processing, high-speed communication, and database management, which current digital electronic computers cannot achieve. To make the computer process problems like a human, the only satisfactory model is to simulate the human brain. The unparalleled ability of the human brain comes from billions of information processors called neurons. Each neuron in the brain is connected to thousands of other neurons, forming a cross-linked information storage library. Information is transmitted back and forth within the brain's neural network, thus completing the information processing process. Scientists believe that it is possible to use optical fibers to connect each of the hundreds of thousands of different input ends (i.e., the computer's neural nodes) with each of the other hundreds of thousands of input ends, and all of this is achieved in the same instant.

The neural network computer is not limited by the structure of conventional databases and can store information based on graphics. Therefore, it can respond to unforeseen situations without the need to re-program.

Due to the fact that optical neural network computer technology can make spacecraft launch and operate more safely and economically, several major U.S. companies are competing to develop reliable diagnostic systems, or artificial intelligence systems. This system can continuously monitor information sent from various parts of the spacecraft and classify it. Some aerospace experts say that the existing monitoring systems are often unreliable due to vibration or electromagnetic interference, and some monitoring systems sometimes send false signals, causing false alarms or misjudgments. However, the fiber-optic monitoring system can avoid these external interferences and can continuously classify and send measurement data from various parts of the spacecraft. During the flight, this computer diagnostic system can timely detect any faults in the system and "think of" a "foolproof" way to eliminate the fault. Even after completing the flight mission (i.e., being recovered or returned), the fiber-optic monitoring system will continue to analyze and process the large amount of data sent from various systems, reporting whether all parts of the spacecraft are working normally. This greatly reduces the ground maintenance time, speeds up the turnover, and establishes the entire launch and flight work on a more secure and reliable basis.

Over the past 30-plus years, space launch missions have often been delayed repeatedly, partly because the amount of information that needs to be tested, screened, analyzed, and verified on the ground is too large, which is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also always makes people anxious. If a fiber-optic monitoring system is installed, it can partially eliminate the above delays.

By the 21st century, not only various launch vehicles and spacecraft, but also various industrial machines, and even cars, can be equipped with optical neural network artificial intelligence systems. They will be able to sense, transmit, store, receive, and process information.

Will the sixth-generation computer be able to fully realize the prophecy in Clarke's science fiction novel and become an important component of spacecraft or launch vehicles in 2001? Perhaps not. However, some experts believe that neural network computers will be applied on the ground before they are applied to aerospace, and it is possible that they will be used on industrial machines first in this century.

　　超级大脑——光学神经风络计算机
　　泰然
    科学家们说，19世纪时，我们解决了如何使用机器来减轻体力负担，20世纪时，我们解决了如何用电子设备来控制机器，而到21世纪时，我们却需要学会如何利用信息反馈给控制机器的电子设备，第六代计算机将担此重任。
    20年前，英国著名科幻作家阿瑟·C·克拉克在科幻小说《超级大脑》中描述了一台取名为“哈尔”的计算机，它独立操纵一艘宇宙飞船，监视和参与管理飞船，它具有人脑的功能，能独立思考和解决问题。
    今天，由于光学研究取得迅速进展，昔日的科学幻想即将变成现实。科学家们深信，科学技术的发展正接近诞生一种类似“哈尔”那样的计算机。预计到下世纪初，这种超级大脑计算机将会用于航天运载工具和各种航天器。实现这一步的关键在于发展光学神经网络计算机。
    日本人把神经网络计算机称作第六代计算机，它与经典的数字计算机大不相同。这种超级大脑计算机依靠比头发丝还细的光纤，而不是金属导线或数字芯来传输信息，其速度达到光速。它能满足代数运算处理、高速通信和数据库管理等方面的要求，而这些是当今的数字电子计算机无法做到的。要使计算机像人那样处理问题，唯一满意的模式就是模拟人脑。而人脑无与伦比的能力来源于亿万个叫作神经的信息处理器。人脑的每一根神经均与上千根其他神经相连，形成了交叉互连的信息贮存库，信息在大脑的神经网络内来回传递，从而完成信息处理过程。科学家们认为，能够用光纤把上百万条不同输入端（即计算机的神经节点）的每一条与其他上百万条输入端的每一条相互连结在一起，而且全部是在同一瞬间实现互连的。
    神经网络计算机不受常规数据库的结构限制，能以图形为基础贮存信息。因此，它无需重编程序，就可对难以预料的状况作出反应。
    由于光学神经网络计算机技术可使航天飞行器更安全、经济地发射和工作，因此，美国几大公司已在竞相研制可靠的诊断系统，或称作人工智能系统。该系统能连续监视航天器各部件发来的信息，并对之进行分类。一些航天专家说，现有的监视系统由于受到振动或电磁干扰，往往是不可靠的，某些监视系统有时会发出伪信号，引起虚惊或判断失误。而光纤监视系统则可免受这些外来干扰，并能连续分类和发送来自航天器各部件的测量数据。在飞行期间，这种计算机诊断系统能及时检测出各系统的任何故障，并“想出”排除这一故障的“万全之计”。甚至在完成飞行任务后（指被回收或返航），光纤监视系统还会继续分析处理各系统发来的大量数据，报告该航天器所有部件的工作状态是否正常。这就大大减少了地面检修时间，加快了周转速度，使整个发射和飞行工作建立在更安全可靠的基础上。
    过去30多年来，航天发射任务常常一再推迟，部分原因是需要在地面检测筛选，分析和验证的信息量太大，不仅费时、费力，而且总是令人提心吊胆。如果安装了光纤监视系统，就能部分地消除上述拖延现象。
    到了21世纪，不仅各种运载工具和航天器，而且各种工业机器，甚至汽车都可装上带光学神经网络的人工智能系统，它们将能够感测、传输、贮存、接收和处理信息。
    第六代计算机能否完全像克拉克科幻小说中所预言的那样，在2001年成为航天器或运载工具的一个重要组成部分呢？也许不可能。不过有些专家却认为，神经网络计算机在应用于航天之前将首先在地面上得到应用，而且有可能在本世纪内首先在工业机器上使用。
