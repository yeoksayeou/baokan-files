     Various Strange Rains in Shouchuan
    “Black Rain”: When black rain falls, dark clouds loom over the city, the sky and earth darken, and the rainwater is mixed with shiny black dust. “Black rain” contains over 30 kinds of metallic elements. Therefore, “black rain” is also called “metallic rain.” This rainwater is acidic, and can also be referred to as “acid rain.”

    “Yellow Rain”: In recent years, yellow rain has frequently fallen in Southeast Asian countries. On exposed rocks and green plant leaves, yellow spots appear in abundance. Biologists have found that “yellow rain” contains a high concentration of pollen, and these pollen types are common in Southeast Asia.

    “Blood Rain”: Red-colored rain is rare and seems somewhat ominous. In Yunnan’s Lvchun County, China, red rain has fallen twice, causing local residents to be in a state of great fear. After investigation by the meteorological bureau, it was discovered that red soil and other red substances on the ground were carried to high altitudes by a tornado, dissolving in the rain clouds, thus causing the falling rain to appear red.

    “Fish Rain”: This refers to heavy rain mixed with countless fish falling from the sky. Recently, some regions in Australia experienced a sudden downpour of “fish rain,” and many residents happily gathered the gift of sardines from the sky. This is the ninth time such an event has occurred in the country. Fifteen years ago, during one such event, people collected over 15,000 bass. “Fish rain” occurs when typhoons, hurricanes, or tornadoes lift fish from the ocean and, as they pass over land, drop them.

     形形色色的怪雨寿川
    “黑雨”：黑雨降临时，黑云压城，天昏地暗，雨水中夹着黑亮亮的粉尘。“黑雨”，含金属元素达30多种。因此，“黑雨”也被称为“金属雨”。这种雨水偏酸性，又可称“酸雨”。
    “黄雨”：近年来东南亚国家屡降“黄雨”，在裸露的岩石及绿色植物的叶片上，星罗棋布地现出一个个黄斑。经生物学家研究发现，“黄雨”中含有高浓度的花粉，这些花粉品种在东南亚都是常见的。
    “血雨”：红颜色的雨很少见，似乎还有些不吉祥。中国云南绿春县曾两次降下红雨，当地百姓惊恐万状。经气象局考察，得知是地面红土和其他红色物质被龙卷风携至高空，溶化于雨云，因而使降落的雨水呈现出红颜色。
      “鱼雨”：即大雨夹带着无数条鱼从天而降。最近，澳大利亚一些地区曾骤降“鱼雨”，不少市民喜拾天赐沙丁鱼，这在该国已是第九次。15年前的一次，人们拾得鲈鱼15000多条。“鱼雨”是由台风、飓风、旋风从海洋中将鱼群卷起，途经陆地时又恰巧将其抛下而发生的。
