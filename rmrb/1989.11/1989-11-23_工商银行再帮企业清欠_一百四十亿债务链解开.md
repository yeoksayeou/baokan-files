The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has once again assisted enterprises in clearing debts. A debt chain of 140 billion yuan among more than 10,000 large and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises across the country has been resolved.

The People's Daily, Zhuzhou, November 22nd - Reporter Pangang reports: The second meeting to assist large and medium-sized enterprises in clearing overdue payments, organized by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, concluded today. In just two days, the bank injected 2.7 billion yuan, resolving or alleviating the "debt chain" issues for 12,500 large and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises. This effort has achieved an effect of activating 5.2 yuan for every 1 yuan invested.

At the beginning of October, the headquarters of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China had already conducted the first cross-provincial and cross-city debt clearing for 36 cities and 5,000 enterprises, amounting to 5.2 billion yuan. This time, in conjunction with the fourth quarter's peak season for fund supply, the bank expanded the debt clearing assistance to the national level.

It is understood that both rounds of cross-provincial and cross-city debt clearing were completed without the enterprises being present, achieved through the exchange of bank drafts. In the recent two-day clearing activities, a total of over 20,000 drafts worth 140 billion yuan were exchanged. Among these, the recovered overdue amounts exceeding 3 billion yuan include those from Shanghai, Hubei, Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning, Shenyang, Jiangsu, and other regions. Beijing alone recovered overdue payments amounting to 10 billion yuan.

As of now, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China system has cumulatively assisted enterprises in clearing 55 billion yuan in overdue payments.

　　工商银行再帮企业清欠
　　一百四十亿债务链解开
    本报株洲11月22日电　记者潘岗报道：全国万余家大中型工商企业间相互拖欠的140亿元货款，今天在这里得到清理。在为期两天的中国工商银行第二次协助大中型企业清理拖欠货款会议上，只投入资金27亿元，就为1.25万家大中型工商企业解除或缓解了“债务链”困扰，收到了投入1元盘活5.2元的效益。
    10月初，中国工商银行总行曾在省市辖区内清欠的基础上，首次跨省市为36城市5000家企业清理拖欠52亿元。这次，他们结合第四季度资金旺季供应工作，把协助企业清理拖欠工作向全国推开。
    据悉，这两次跨省市“清欠”工作都是在企业不到场的情况下，通过银行承兑汇票交换实现的。在近两天的清欠活动中，共交换票据2万多笔、140亿元，其中收回拖欠金额在3亿元以上的有上海、湖北、北京、天津、河北、辽宁、沈阳、江苏等地，仅北京市就收回拖欠金额10亿元。
    截至目前，工商银行系统已累计协助企业清欠550亿元。
