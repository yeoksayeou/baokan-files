The port of Shipu in Zhejiang Province has become a frequent docking point for Taiwanese fishing boats, and maritime links across the Taiwan Strait are becoming increasingly close. From January to October this year, nearly 1,200 Taiwanese boats have entered Shipu Port, with over 8,400 fishermen. In comparison, the number of Taiwanese boats entering the port last year was only 700.

In recent years, Shipu Port has established facilities such as a reception center for Taiwanese compatriots, a specialized shipyard for repairing Taiwanese boats, a wharf, and a hospital for Taiwanese compatriots. It is understood that currently, Taiwanese boats entering Shipu Port account for more than 40% of the total number of Taiwanese boats docking at mainland ports.
