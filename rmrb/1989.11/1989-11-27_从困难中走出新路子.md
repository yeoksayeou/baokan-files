In the current situation of a sluggish market and tight funds, what should enterprises do? Today, the People's Daily publishes the story of Shanghai Bu Yun Rubber Joint Venture Company, which faces difficulties head-on. This provides an inspiring and combative response to this severe challenge, and is well worth reading by those in the economic sector and those who care about economic work.

The communiqué of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party points out that the rectification and adjustment must focus on four key links, one of which is to "deeply carry out the movement of increasing production and saving, increasing income and reducing expenditure, work hard to improve enterprise management, tap internal potential, improve technological level, and take the road of economic development with less investment, more output, high quality, and good benefits." Bu Yun Company has taken this path in the face of difficulties. They did not lose heart or become helpless just because the market was sluggish, funds were tight, and production had temporarily declined. Instead, they summoned the courage to speed up the adjustment of product structure and continuously develop high-level new products that are in demand, thereby quickly turning the situation around and bringing new vitality and development to the enterprise. This spirit of daring to struggle and being good at managing is the most important quality that successful enterprises should have, and it is worth advocating in the current rectification and adjustment.

The general manager of Bu Yun Company, Yang Shaozhen, said: "Every enterprise must face storms, and difficulties will bring new vitality to the enterprise." This sentence provides a profound summary of the dual nature of difficulties. Indeed, the growth and development of any enterprise will encounter various difficulties and challenges. In addition to facing fierce competition in improving quality, reducing costs, expanding sales channels, and developing new technologies and new products, enterprises sometimes have to face the pressure of drastic changes in the macroeconomic environment on their development journey. China's current rectification and adjustment is a major economic adjustment. At this moment, the predicaments faced by enterprises are generally similar, but the responses of various enterprises are very different. Some enterprises are constrained by difficulties, unable to take any action, and thus are likely to fall behind or even be eliminated. However, some enterprises can rely on the broad masses of workers in the face of difficulties, summon the courage to struggle, think of ways, and in the face of numerous difficulties, not only survive but also open up a new path. Bu Yun Company is obviously the latter type.

Success means overcoming difficulties. In this sense, without difficulties, there is no success. This is an important enlightenment that Bu Yun Company provides to the broad masses of enterprises, as well as to us on various fronts, in the rectification and adjustment.

　　从困难中走出新路子
　　本报评论员
    在当前市场疲软、资金紧缺的困难处境下，企业应该怎么办？今天本报刊登的上海步云橡胶联营公司知难而进的事迹，对这个严峻的挑战作出了颇具启发性和应战力的回答，很值得经济界和关心经济工作的同志一读。
    党的十三届五中全会公报指出，治理整顿必须抓住4个重要环节，其中之一就是要“深入开展增产节约、增收节支运动，下功夫改进企业的经营管理，挖掘内部潜力，提高科技水平，走投入少、产出多、质量高、效益好的经济发展路子”。步云公司在困难面前走的就是这条路子，他们没有因为市场疲软，资金周转困难，生产一度下降就丧失信心、束手无策，而是鼓起勇气，加快调整产品结构，不断开发适销对路的高水平的新产品，因此很快就打开了局面，使企业获得了新的生机和发展。这种敢于搏击又善于经营的精神，是成功的企业应具备的最重要的素质，在当前治理整顿中值得大力倡导。
    步云公司的总经理杨少振说：“每个企业都要经受风浪，困难将给企业带来新的生机。”这句话对困难的二重性作了精辟的概括。的确，任何企业的成长和发展都会遇到各种困难和挑战。除了在提高质量、降低成本、拓展销路以及开发新技术、新产品上随时都面临着激烈的竞争之外，企业在发展的征途中有时还要受到大的经济环境剧烈变化的压力。我国目前的治理整顿就是一次大的经济调整。在这样的时刻，企业面临的困境大体上是相同的，然而各个企业的回应却很不一样。有的企业被困难束缚了手脚，无所作为，这就难免要掉队甚至被淘汰。而有些企业在困难面前却能紧紧依靠广大职工，鼓起勇气奋斗，想方设法，在重重困难中不但生存下来而且打开一条新的出路。步云公司显然是后一类。
    成功就意味着战胜困难。从这个意义上来说，没有困难也就没有成功。这是在治理整顿中，步云公司给广大企业，也是给我们各条战线提供的一条重要的启示。
