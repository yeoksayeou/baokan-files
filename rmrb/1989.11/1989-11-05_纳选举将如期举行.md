Xinhua News Agency, Windhoek, November 3rd.

Namibia is preparing for the independence elections scheduled to begin next Tuesday. The South African administrator in Namibia has assured that the elections will proceed as planned.

Reports from across Namibia indicate that the situation is calm, with peaceful rallies held by various parties yesterday.

Today, at a press conference, spokesperson for the United Nations Transition Assistance Group, Ekhard, stated that South Africa's accusations are "shameless fabrications" and "deception."

A spokesperson for the South African administrator in Namibia confirmed that there are no soldiers or tanks from the People's Liberation Army of Namibia, the armed wing of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), within Namibia's borders.

It is understood that the United Nations Security Council has agreed to a declaration on the Namibian Constitutional Assembly with only minor modifications.

    纳选举将如期举行
    新华社温得和克11月3日电　纳米比亚正在为下星期二开始举行的独立选举作准备。南非驻纳行政长官作出保证，选举将如期举行。
    据来自整个纳米比亚的报道表明，纳米比亚局势平静，昨天不同党派举行的集会都是和平进行的。
    联合国过渡时期援助团发言人埃克哈德今天在记者招待会上说，南非的指责是“无耻的捏造”和“欺骗”。
    南非驻纳米比亚行政长官发言人证实，在纳米比亚境内既没有西南非洲人民组织的纳米比亚人民解放军战士，也没有他们的任何坦克。
    据悉，联合国安理会已经同意关于纳米比亚宪法议会的宣言，只作了小小修改。
