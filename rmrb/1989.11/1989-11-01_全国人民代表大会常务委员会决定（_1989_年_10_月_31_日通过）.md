The Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress, at its 10th session, reviewed a report by Ji Pengfei, Chairman of the Drafting Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, regarding changes in some members of the Drafting Committee. The Standing Committee decided:

1. To approve the resignation of Cha Liang-yung and Kong Kwok-che from their positions as members of the Drafting Committee. It is hoped that they will continue to contribute to the drafting of the Basic Law.

2. Given that the recent actions of Stephen Cheong and Lee Cheuk-yan are highly inconsistent with the identity of a member of the Drafting Committee, and as long as they do not abandon their stance of hostility towards the Chinese government and their attempt to negate the Sino-British Joint Declaration, they cannot continue to participate in the work of the Drafting Committee.

    全国人民代表大会常务委员会决定
    （1989年10月31日通过）
    第七届全国人民代表大会常务委员会第十次会议审议了香港特别行政区基本法起草委员会主任委员姬鹏飞关于起草委员会部分委员变动情况的报告，决定：
    一、同意查良镛、邝广杰辞去起草委员会委员职务。希望他们对基本法起草工作继续作出贡献。
    二、鉴于司徒华、李柱铭近期的言行同起草委员会委员的身份极不相符，在他们未放弃敌视中国政府和企图否定中英联合声明的立场之前，不能再参加起草委员会的工作。
