The Ministry of Commerce today issued a notice on expediting the procurement of cotton in the latter part of this year.

The notice stated that this year's cotton procurement work, under the leadership of various levels of party committees and governments and with the cooperation of relevant departments, has achieved relatively good results. By November 10, the country had procured 2.02 million tons of cotton, completing 46% of the contracted procurement plan. The procurement progress in Shandong Province and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is relatively fast, with over 60% of the contracted procurement plan completed. However, the procurement progress in most regions is slow, with provinces such as Hubei, Henan, Hunan, Shaanxi, and Zhejiang completing less than one-third of the contracted procurement plan. Currently, the procurement work is in the latter stage, and a large amount of cotton is still in the hands of cotton farmers. To ensure that all commercial cotton is procured in good quality and quantity as soon as possible, the following urgent notice is issued:

1.	Strengthen the leadership of the latter-stage cotton procurement work, seize the opportunity to organize several cotton sales peaks, and strive to complete 80% or more of the planned procurement volume by the end of November, and basically complete the procurement task by the end of the year. Various methods should be adopted to mobilize cotton farmers to actively sell cotton. Cadres and workers who live in rural areas, as well as party and league members in rural areas, should take the lead in selling cotton to the state. Educate cotton farmers to cherish their labor fruits, pick the cotton clean, and strive to ensure that the cotton is stored in the warehouse. After the information that the state will raise the cotton procurement price starting September 1 next year is conveyed to the cotton farmers, help the cotton farmers calculate the account of "storing cotton is not as good as selling cotton for money," overcome the mentality of waiting for a higher price and selling later, and sell cotton as soon as possible to avoid losses.

2.	Although the supply of cotton procurement funds in the early stage is relatively tight, it is better than last year and basically guarantees the need. At present, especially during the procurement peak, the procurement volume of cotton is large and the time is concentrated. Close cooperation with the Agricultural Bank should be maintained to manage the fund allocation, provide timely fund supply and cash demand plans, and effectively avoid the practice of "issuing IOUs" for procurement. The supply of diesel and fertilizer for rewards and sales should be ensured and implemented.

3.	Continue to adhere to the principle of "who signs the contract, who procures," strictly implement the procurement policy, and correctly grasp the national cotton standards to provide high-quality services for farmers. In the latter stage of procurement, the proportion of frost-damaged cotton and deseeded cotton is relatively large, the grades are complex, and the technical requirements are high. It is even more necessary to adhere to the "five fixed" and coded inspection, and strictly follow the standards. Do not procure cotton with excessive moisture. Do not estimate and clear in one go. Resolutely prevent the situation of reducing grades, reducing prices, and reducing moisture that occurred in the latter stage of cotton procurement last year. The main responsible persons of various levels of supply and marketing cooperatives should go deep into the procurement front line, inspect and guide the work, and timely help solve problems.

4.	The management of the cotton market and procurement order in the early stage is basically good. In the latter stage, the relaxation mentality should be prevented, and the situation of being strict in the front and loose in the back, and having a big head and a small tail should not be allowed. Insist on not opening the free cotton trading market. Resolutely crack down on the illegal procurement, hoarding, and operation of cotton by cotton merchants and mills. Those who forcefully buy and sell, bully the market, and engage in illegal activities such as "cotton tycoons" and "local bullies" should be dealt with according to law. Support the work of cotton procurement inspection teams at all levels and take active measures to prevent the occurrence of competitive and speculative purchasing.

5.	Strengthen the safety management work. Special attention should be paid to fire prevention and mildew prevention. The principle of "safety first, prevention first" and the principle of "who is in charge, who is responsible" should be seriously implemented to establish a safety responsibility system, block loopholes, eliminate hidden dangers, and ensure the safety of state property and the lives of the people. During the procurement peak, the safety work should be organized and inspected.

6.	The procurement quantity must be reported in a timely and accurate manner, and no concealment or private use should be allowed. This is an important link to ensure that the state has the necessary resources. Various places should strengthen the sense of discipline and overall situation, and resolutely act according to the state's policies and plans.

    多数地区棉花收购进度较慢  商业部发紧急通知要求抓紧
    新华社北京11月15日电  商业部今天发出关于抓紧今年后期棉花收购工作的通知。
    通知指出，今年棉花收购工作，在各级党委、政府领导和有关部门大力配合下，已经取得了较好的成绩。到11月10日止，全国收购棉花202万吨，完成合同定购计划的46％。收购进度较快的山东省和新疆维吾尔自治区，已完成合同定购计划的60％以上。但大部分地区收购进度较慢，湖北、河南、湖南、陕西、浙江等省完成合同定购计划不足1／3。当前收购工作已近后期，大量棉花还在棉农手中。为了尽快把全部商品棉保质保量收购上来，特紧急通知如下：
    一、切实加强对后期棉花收购工作的领导，不失时机地组织几次售棉高潮，力争在11月底完成预计收购量的80％或更多一点，年底前基本完成收购任务。要采取各种方式，动员棉农积极交售棉花。家在农村的干部职工以及农村中的党团员，要带头向国家交售棉花。要教育棉农珍惜劳动果实，把棉花拣拾干净，争取朵絮归仓。国家决定明年9月1日起提高棉花收购价格的信息传达给棉农后，要帮助棉农算好“存棉不如卖棉存钱”的帐，克服待价惜售思想，尽早售棉，避免损失。
    二、前期棉花收购资金供应虽然比较紧张，但好于去年，基本保证了需要。当前，尤其是掀起收购高潮期间，棉花收购量大，时间集中，要同农业银行密切配合，搞好资金调度，及时提供资金供应和现金需求计划，切实避免打“白条”收购。要落实好奖售柴油、化肥的货源和调运、兑现工作。
    三、要继续坚持谁订合同谁收购的原则，严格执行收购政策，正确掌握国家棉花标准，为农民提供优质服务。后期收购，霜后棉、剥桃棉所占比重较大，等级复杂，技术要求高，更要坚持“一式五定”和密码检验，严格按标准办事。不得收购超水棉。不得估验搞“一口清”。要坚决防止出现去年棉花收购中后期让级、让价、让水分的情况。各级供销社主要负责人要深入收购第一线，检查指导工作，及时帮助解决问题。
    四、前期棉花市场管理和收购秩序情况基本是好的，后期要防止松懈情绪，不能前紧后松，虎头蛇尾。坚持不开放棉花自由交易市场，对棉花商贩和纱厂非法收购、套购、经营棉花的行为，要坚决取缔。对那些强买强卖、欺行霸市的“棉霸”、“地头蛇”一类不法分子，要依法打击。要支持各级棉花收购巡视组的工作，采取积极措施，防止发生争购抢购现象。
    五、加强安全保管工作。要特别注意防火、防霉变。要认真贯彻“安全第一，预防为主”的方针和谁主管、谁负责的原则，落实安全责任制，堵绝漏洞，消除隐患，确保国家财产和人民群众生命安全。收购高潮期间，要组织好安全工作的检查。
    六、必须及时、如数上报收购数量，不得瞒报和私留动用。这是确保国家掌握必要资源的重要环节，各地要加强纪律观念和全局观念，坚决按照国家政策、计划办事。
