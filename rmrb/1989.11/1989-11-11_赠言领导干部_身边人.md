Words of Advice for the "Inner Circle" of Leading Cadres

The "inner circle" of leading cadres—secretaries and drivers—due to their special positions, are highly respected by the masses. Generally, these comrades work diligently and speak and act with principle. However, there are a few who use their special status for personal gain.

They seek personal gain by using the names of leading cadres, falsely claiming to act on their behalf. The negative impact of this is obvious; it not only damages their own reputation but also lowers the prestige of the leading cadres. The reasons for this are mainly that these "inner circle" members have low quality, or they harbor a "superior" mentality, or some leading cadres lack strict education and management of these "inner circle" members. In the fight against corruption, those working close to leading cadres should also strictly demand of themselves.

    赠言领导干部“身边人”
    领导干部“身边人”——秘书、司机由于其身份特殊，群众对他们很尊重。这些同志中一般对工作兢兢业业，说话办事很有原则。但也有少数同志却利用自己的特殊身份谋私。
    他们谋私，一般都是打着领导干部的旗号，假借领导干部的名义，其不良影响是显而易见的，不仅败坏本人的名声，也降低了领导干部的声誉。发生的原因，主要是这些领导干部“身边人”素质不高，或者存在着“高人一等”的思想，或者有的领导干部对这些“身边人”缺乏严格的教育和管理。在清除腐败中，在领导干部身边工作的同志也应严格要求自己。
