East German leaders emphasize that German reunification is not on the agenda

	Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 21st: Correspondent Xu Hongzhi reports: The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic, Egon Krenz, and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Hans Modrow, held talks yesterday with the Minister of the Federal Chancellery of the Federal Republic of Germany, Rudolf Seiters, who was specially sent to Berlin for a visit. Both sides frankly exchanged views on a series of issues regarding the current relationship between the two countries.

	Krenz and Modrow introduced to Seiters the action program for the thorough socialist reform in the GDR by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the program of the new government.

	The GDR leaders emphasized that the stability of the relationship between the two Germanys is a prerequisite for European stability. In the relationship between the two Germanys, the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, equality, and non-interference should be followed. The issue of reunification is not on the agenda. The German Democratic Republic is now and will remain in the future a sovereign state.

	Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 23rd: The GDR leader Egon Krenz pointed out on the 23rd that the existence of the two Germanys is a historical fact since the end of World War II. The situation of the coexistence of the two Germanys will continue for a long time.

	Krenz made these remarks during an interview with a reporter from West German Television Channel One.

	Krenz emphasized that now most people in the GDR believe that the arrogant attitude of some politicians in the Federal Republic of Germany is offensive. "The GDR is absolutely not a state of the Federal Republic of Germany, but can only exist as a socialist country where the people are masters."

　　民主德国领导人强调
　　两德统一提不到议事日程
    本报柏林11月21日电　记者许宏治报道：德国统一社会党中央总书记、民主德国国务委员会主席克伦茨和部长会议主席莫德罗，昨天同专程前来柏林访问的联邦德国总理府部长赛特斯进行了会谈。双方对当前两国关系的一系列问题坦率地交换了意见。
    克伦茨和莫德罗向赛特斯介绍了德国统一社会党在民德进行彻底的社会主义革新的行动纲领和新政府的纲领。
    民德领导人强调，两个德国之间关系的稳定是欧洲稳定的前提。在两个德国的关系中应遵循相互尊重主权、领土完整、平等和互不干涉的原则。重新统一的问题提不到议事日程上。民主德国现在是、将来也仍然是一个主权国家。
    新华社柏林11月23日电民主德国领导人克伦茨23日指出，两个德国的存在是第二次世界大战后的历史事实。两个德国并存的状况还将延续很长一段时间。
    克伦茨是在接受西德电视一台记者采访时说这番话的。
    克伦茨着重指出，现在民主德国大多数人都认为，联邦德国某些政治家的那种居高临下的傲慢态度是令人反感的。“民主德国绝不是联邦德国的一个州，而只能是作为一个人民当家作主的社会主义国家而存在”。
