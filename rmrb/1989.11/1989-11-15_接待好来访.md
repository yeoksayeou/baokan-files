How well visitors are received largely depends on the work of the reception staff.

Visitors and reception staff form an interdependent whole in the visitor reception process. Visiting is an action taken by visitors to achieve a certain goal. In the eyes of visitors, reception staff represent the party and government handling their issues, and thus visitors place their hopes in the reception staff.

In the eyes of reception staff, visitors come continuously every day, reflecting a wide range of problems and making various demands (some reasonable, some unreasonable). The types of visits are diverse (first visits, repeat visits, individual visits, group visits). How should these be handled?

If there is a lack of the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, visitors will be seen as a burden, and issues will be pushed away. Irresponsible reception will only harm the reputation of the party and government.

If there is a spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, reception staff will treat visitors with warmth, even if the visitors are unreasonable, they will strive to do their best. From the two letters to the editor published here, it can be seen that as long as the reception staff do their duties conscientiously, it will be beneficial for the stability and unity of a region or unit, and will enhance the prestige of the party and government.

Currently, the country faces many difficulties, and there are many ideological and practical problems among the people. It is hoped that this will be given serious attention by local party and government departments, and that through receiving visitors, ideological and political work can be done for the people, practical matters can be handled for the people, so that everyone can march forward together on the road of socialist modernization.

### 接待好来访

    接待好来访
    来访接待做得如何，很大程度上取决于接待人员的工作。
    来访人与接待人，是来访接待关系中互为依存的统一体。来访，是来访人为达到某种愿望的一种行为。在来访人眼里，接待人代表着党和政府处理着自己的问题，因而对接待人寄托着希望。
    在接待人眼里，每天来访人不断，反映的问题包罗万象，提出的要求多种多样（有合理的，不合理的），来访种类五花八门（有初访、重访，有个人访、集体访）。这些，应怎样对待呢？
    如果缺乏为人民服务的精神，就会把来访看作负担，遇事推之门外。不负责任的接待，只会损害党和政府的声誉。
    如果具有全心全意为人民服务精神，对来访人就会心似一团火，即便是来访者无理，也会千方百计地做好工作。从这里发表的两封读者来信看，只要来访接待人尽职尽责，那会有利于一个地区、一个单位的安定团结，有利于提高党和政府的威望。
    目前，国家面临很多困难，群众中存在的思想问题和现实问题不少，希望引起各地党政部门的切实重视，通过接待来访，做好群众的思想政治工作，为群众办实事，使大家在社会主义现代化建设的道路上，同心同德向前迈进。
