"Our country's coal industry must have momentum to ensure the sustained and stable development of the national economy. This must rely on the progress of science and technology." This was stated by State Councilor Zhou Jiahua at the conclusion of the National Coal Science and Technology Work Conference today.

Coal is our country's primary energy source. If the coal industry does not advance, other industries will not either. According to energy experts' predictions, by the year 2000, our country will need at least 1.45 billion tons of raw coal, of which 532 million tons will be needed for thermal power generation, and 100 million tons of coking coal will be needed for steel production... The demand for coal is immense. In recent years, our country's coal industry has made great efforts, and this year it will exceed 1 billion tons. However, due to insufficient investment, overloading, and severe losses, it lacks the ability for self-improvement and self-development. By the year 2000, the production capacity of state-assigned mines that will be phased out or decommissioned will decrease by 550-700 million tons. How can we address the lack of momentum? Zhou Jiahua said: First, we must deepen reforms, use reforms to oversee the entire situation, and use reforms to promote development. Second, we must rely on technological progress.

	• We must adapt to local conditions and develop multi-level mechanized coal mining technologies to free coal miners from heavy physical labor. There are over 400 comprehensive mechanized mining equipment units nationwide, and we must manage and use them well to fully exploit their potential. We must raise the reliability of the extensive coal mining and mining area systems to a new level, increasing the operating time by about 20% compared to now. We must build a number of modern new mines, and those that can adopt comprehensive mechanized mining should do so as much as possible. Those that do not have the conditions should arrange for high-grade general mechanized mining, and those that are suitable for water mining should adopt water mining. We must reduce the proportion of blasting mining as much as possible, and the national mechanization level of coal mining should be increased from the current 58% to 66%.

	• We must accelerate the construction of new mines. By the end of the century, the capacity added by new state-assigned coal mines will be 250 million tons. Time is coal. The earlier a new mine is completed and put into production, the earlier it can help the country alleviate energy difficulties. Therefore, we must vigorously adopt advanced technologies, speed up construction progress, and shorten the construction period.

	• We must vigorously develop coal processing and utilization technologies. Coal is both a fuel and a raw material, and there are more than 40 elements that coexist and accompany coal. Fully utilizing these elements not only increases a large amount of wealth for the country but also opens up a path for the coal industry. We must make good use of the large amount of gangue discharged by coal mines. We must improve the coal washing and beneficiation capacity, which is an effective measure to ease energy shortages.

	• We must earnestly promote the 100 mature new coal technologies that have already been developed, so that they can quickly be transformed into productive forces. For the 50 new key research and development projects, we must work together to complete them, so that our country's coal industry can reach a new level.

    邹家华在全国煤炭科技会议上强调
    煤炭工业要依靠科技增后劲
    推广百项成熟技术　攻下50个重点项目
    本报北京11月12日讯　记者刘燮阳报道：“我国煤炭工业要有后劲，保证国民经济持续稳定的发展，必须依靠科学技术进步。”这是国务委员邹家华在今天结束的全国煤炭科技工作会议上讲的。
    煤炭是我国的主要能源，煤炭工业上不去，其它工业也上不去。据能源专家预测，到2000年，我国至少需要原煤14.5亿吨，其中火力发电需5.32亿吨，钢铁需要精煤1亿吨……各方面要煤量很多。这些年来，我国煤炭工业出力很大，今年可突破10亿吨，但是由于投入不足，负荷过重，亏损严重，缺乏自我改造和自我发展的能力，到2000年衰减和报废的统配矿井将减产5500—7000万吨，后劲不足，怎么办？邹家华说：一是要深化改革，以改革总揽全局，以改革促进发展，二是要依靠科技进步。
    ——要因地制宜，发展多层次的采煤机械化技术，使煤矿工人从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来。全国现有综采设备400多台，一定要管好用好，充分发挥其效能；要把量大面广的采煤和采区系统的可靠性再上一个新台阶，开机时间比现在提高20％左右；要建设一批现代化的新矿井，能上综采的尽量上综采，没有条件上的则安排高档普采，适合水采条件的上水采，尽量减少炮采的比重，全国采煤机械化程度要从现在的58％提高到66％。
    ——加快新井建设的速度。本世纪末，靠新建统配煤矿增加的能力是2.5亿吨，时间就是煤炭，新井早一天建成，早一天投产，就能为国家分担能源的困难。因此，要大力采用先进技术，加快施工进度，缩短工期。
    ——大力发展煤炭加工利用技术。煤炭既是燃料，又是原料，与煤炭共生、伴生的元素有40多种，充分利用这些元素，不仅为国家增加一大笔财富，而且为煤炭工业打开一条出路。对煤矿排放的大量矸石要很好利用起来；要提高煤炭的加工洗选能力，这是缓解能源紧张的一项有效措施。
    ——认真推广已经成熟的100项煤炭新技术，使其迅速转化为生产力。对50项新重点攻关项目，要齐心协力拿下来，使我国煤炭工业达到一个新水平。
