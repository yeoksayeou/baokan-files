Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 24th.

One year ago today, the Liu Shaoqi Memorial Hall officially opened to the public. Since then, visitors have been continuous, reaching over 410,000 people, including more than 560 visitors from over 60 countries and regions, as well as compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau.

The Liu Shaoqi Memorial Hall, located in Tanzi Village, Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, is 35 kilometers away from the Mao Zedong Memorial Hall in Shaoshan. It has become an excellent place for conducting party spirit education, revolutionary tradition education, and education on the spirit of hard work and self-reliance for a large number of party members and the masses.

In addition to carefully explaining and guiding visitors in the exhibition hall, the staff of the Liu Shaoqi Memorial Hall also organize visitors to study relevant topics about Liu Shaoqi's thoughts according to the rules of the surge in visitors before and after revolutionary traditional festivals, such as "Liu Shaoqi and the Youth Movement" on May 4th Youth Day, "Stories of Liu Shaoqi" on June 1st Children's Day, and "A Model Communist - Liu Shaoqi" on July 1st, the Party's birthday. In just one week before and after this year's July 1st, more than 150 grassroots party organizations and over 7,500 party members came here to receive party spirit education, and some even held oath-taking ceremonies for new party members.

After Liu Shaoqi was rehabilitated, the memorial hall received 394 calligraphic and painting works from central leaders and famous calligraphers and painters commemorating Liu Shaoqi. Among them, nearly 200 works by comrades such as Bo Yibo, Song Renqiong, Wang Shoudao, Zhu Lifan, and Wang Renzhong were exhibited in the memorial hall yesterday.

　　刘少奇纪念馆观众踊跃
　　开馆一年接待40万人
    据新华社长沙11月24日电　（记者刘春贤）一年前的今天，刘少奇同志纪念馆正式向国内外群众开放。开馆以来，观众络绎不绝，至今已达41万多人次，其中有60多个国家和地区的外宾及港澳同胞560多人次。
    位于湖南省宁乡县炭子冲的刘少奇同志纪念馆，与相距35公里的韶山毛泽东同志纪念馆一样，已成为向广大党员和群众进行党性教育、革命传统教育、艰苦奋斗精神教育的好地方。
    刘少奇同志纪念馆的同志除了在陈列厅认真地讲解和导游外，还根据革命传统节日前后参观者踊跃的规律，组织观众学习刘少奇同志思想的有关专题：如“五四”青年节的《刘少奇同志与青年运动》；“六一”儿童节的《刘少奇同志的故事》；“七一”党的生日的《共产党人的楷模——刘少奇》等。仅今年“七一”前后一个星期，就有150多个基层党组织7500多名党员到这里接受党性教育，有的还举行入党宣誓仪式。
    刘少奇同志平反后，先后收到中央领导同志和知名书画家怀念刘少奇同志的题词、绘画作品394幅；其中薄一波、宋任穷、王首道、朱学范、王任重等同志的近200幅书画作品，已于昨天在纪念馆展出。
