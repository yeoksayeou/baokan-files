A New World Economic Order Must Be Established

By Xinhua News Agency reporters Yang Yuanhua and Xu Donghua

The Senegalese Ambassador to the European Economic Community, Fallou Kane, recently emphasized in Luxembourg that "there are still injustices in the world today, and a new economic order must be established to eliminate the imbalances in development among countries."

He made these remarks during an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency. The ambassador was in Luxembourg to attend a ministerial-level meeting between the EEC and ACP (African, Caribbean, and Pacific) countries to renew the fourth Lomé Convention.

He said, "We hope to strengthen cooperation between the European Economic Community and ACP countries in agriculture, industry, culture, technology, and regional development. Currently, both sides have reached agreements on developing agriculture, fisheries, industry, and ensuring food supplies, but we are not satisfied with the current progress of cooperation. There are still disagreements on certain issues, and the EEC has not shown any flexibility."

"Currently, the content of the Lomé Convention should be expanded to include environmental protection and strengthening cultural cooperation."

"Western newspapers and television only reflect the poverty, coups, and disasters of the Third World, but do not reflect our efforts to develop the economy and improve the living standards of the people. Therefore, we have established a fund organization and requested the Community to recognize it, jointly publish books, and develop the film and television industry to change our image."

When discussing North-South relations, he stated, "Now, money from ACP countries is flowing to Western developed countries. Our farmers are working hard to produce various raw materials and primary products, but the prices of these products are not set by the producing countries, but in New York and London. They lower the prices of products, making our farmers' income insufficient to compensate for their labor, and we still have to use meager incomes to repay debts. Therefore, we demand that the debt issue be included in the Lomé Convention."

The ambassador, when discussing the financial aid provided by the EEC for the Lomé Convention, said, "The funds provided by the EEC should consider factors such as the decline in primary product prices, economic adjustment, environmental protection, population, and inflation. ACP countries demand that the EEC provide 15.5 billion European Currency Units to solve our problems." He stressed, "The EEC should make efforts in this regard, and this amount of money is within the EEC's capabilities."

The EEC provided 8.5 billion European Currency Units of financial aid for the third Lomé Convention.

He warned Western countries that the practice of lowering primary product prices is not advisable, "This is also dangerous for the West. If farmers stop growing grains, cocoa, and coffee, and instead grow crops for making drugs, then it will be a threat to everyone's survival."

　　必须建立新的世界经济秩序
　　新华社记者　杨元华　徐东华
    塞内加尔驻欧洲共同体大使法利卢·卡内最近在卢森堡强调指出：“当前世界上仍然存在不公正的现象，必须建立新的经济秩序才能消除各国在发展方面的不平衡。”
    他是在接受新华社记者专访时说这番话的。这位大使到卢森堡是为了参加欧共体和非加太地区国家就续签第四个《洛美协定》而举行的部长级会议的。
    他说：“我们希望加强欧洲共同体和非加太国家间的农业、工业、文化、技术和地区之间的合作。目前，双方在发展农业、渔业、工业和保证粮食供应方面达成了协议，但我们对目前的合作进程并不满意。在某些问题上双方仍存在分歧，欧共体至今仍没有松动。”
      “目前《洛美协定》内容要扩大到保护生态环境和加强文化合作方面。”
      “西方的报纸和电视只反映我们第三世界的穷困、政变和灾荒，而不反映我们为发展经济和提高人民生活水平所作的努力。所以我们已成立了一个基金组织，并要求共同体予以承认，共同出版书籍和发展电影电视事业，以改变我们的形象。”
    在谈到南北关系时，他表示，“现在是非加太国家的钱流到了西方发达国家。我们的农民正在为生产各种原料和初级产品而进行辛勤的劳动，但是产品的价格并不是由生产国制定的，而是在纽约、伦敦制定的。它们压低产品价格，使我们农民收入不能补偿付出的劳动，而且还要用微薄的收入来偿还债务，所以我们要求把债务问题列入《洛美协定》。”
    这位大使在谈到欧共体为《洛美协定》提供的财政援助时说，“欧共体所提供的款项要考虑到初级产品价格下跌、经济调整、环境保护、人口和通货膨胀的因素。非加太国家要求欧共体提供155亿欧洲货币单位来解决我们的问题。”他强调说：“欧共体应当在这方面作出努力，这笔款项并不超出欧共体的能力。”
    欧共体为第三个《洛美协定》提供了85亿欧洲货币单位的财政援助。
    他告诫西方国家，压低初级产品价格的作法是不可取的，“这对西方也是危险的，如果农民不种粮食、可可、咖啡，而去种制造毒品的作物，那么对大家的生存都是威胁。”
