The border between Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, along the Jinsha River.

Rapid waters, lonely mountains. Twenty-five years ago, a group of pioneers came here. Facing towering mountains and steep cliffs, their response was: "Let's level the ground." Subsequently, on this 2.5 square kilometer piece of land, the Chinese people established a large-scale comprehensive steel production enterprise with an annual capacity of 1.5 million tons of steel—Pan Gang.

Twenty-five years have passed. This, the only steel and iron enterprise in China that was designed, installed, and produced independently, has answered three questions posed by the world:

First, it is not an experimental plant; second, a steel plant built by Chinese people can indeed reach the designed level; third, after reaching the designed level, efficiency can continue to improve.

Now, Pan Gang is constructing its second phase, which will increase its production capacity to 2.5 million tons of steel. At that time, the land area per ton of steel in Pan Gang will be only 1 square meter.

Facing this "ivory micro-carved steel city," foreign experts studying China's steel industry exclaimed: "This is the pride of China's steel industry!"

A country, a nation, an enterprise—without a spirit, it is frightening, dangerous, and has no future.

This is the conclusion drawn by Pan Gang people from their entrepreneurial practice.

"Sky is the canopy, earth is the bed, busy carrying water by the Jinsha River, three stones support a pot, soy sauce and salt with dry rations." Today, the younger generation of Pan Gang can hardly imagine the entrepreneurial scene from this folk song. However, for the first generation of builders of Pan Gang, it is an unforgettable memory.

Li Zhi, the 53-year-old director of the Vanadium Alloy Steel Plant, came to this place called Dujiang (now Panzhihua City) in 1967 and was still a young man at the time. "At that time, we dropped our luggage and set up tents, drank yellow water," he said in his northern accent, recalling the past. Here, the summer lasts for four months, and going out means climbing slopes. Before the Chengdu-Kunming Railway was completed, all equipment and living supplies had to be transported by trucks.

For national pride, tens of thousands of builders left their parents and children, braved the scorching sun, and trod the wilderness, shouting the slogan: "Don't think of father, don't think of mother, don't produce iron, don't go home."

The first generation of builders of Pan Gang were full of political enthusiasm and determined to write their youthful chapters on this barren land.

The Construction Company is a subsidiary of Pan Gang, responsible for the construction and installation of civilian living facilities. In the past, like many large-scale engineering projects, Pan Gang focused on "production first, living conditions later, production available, living conditions not available." In the 1980s, could the living environment be improved quickly? The responsibility fell on the shoulders of the Construction Company. To prevent the peacocks from flying east, the workers of the Construction Company, under the scorching sun and on the wilderness, built "brick by brick, plaster by plaster," contributing more than 50,000 square meters of residential buildings each year. Seeing the buildings rise one after another, the workers of the Construction Company were happy. The frontline workers of Pan Gang mostly lived in relatively good conditions, but the workers of the Construction Company lived in poor conditions, with no factory buildings, high mobility, and outdoor work, making the hardships imaginable. The Provincial Labor and Health Research Institute measured last year that the labor intensity of construction workers was the highest. However, the bonuses were lower than those of the frontline workers, so it was no wonder that some young workers complained. Complaints aside, when it came to the real deal, the Construction Company stood up. This year, the Construction Company undertook the construction of nearly 10,000 square meters of school buildings for Pan No. 1 Middle School, completing it in less than half a year. According to the design, it was difficult to complete in such a short time. However, the workers, for the education of Pan Gang, endured temperatures of 40°C, overcame the interference of turmoil, did not earn an extra penny in bonuses, and completed the task. The company manager, Yu Qingnian, sighed: "Without the 'I suffer hardships for the happiness of millions' spirit of the Construction Company, without hard work and perseverance, it is impossible to survive and develop here. The spirit of the Construction Company is a specific manifestation of the Pan Gang spirit."

The Pan Gang spirit has enabled Pan Gang to take three solid steps, achieving three firsts: from construction to production, Pan Gang took 5 years, which was the first in China; from production to reaching the designed level took 10 years, which was the first in the country; and there was also efficiency. From 1981 to 1985 was Pan Gang's take-off period, with a total profit of 1.4 billion yuan, equivalent to the state's total investment in Pan Gang's first-phase project. Pan Gang took 15 years from production to repaying the principal, which was also the first in the country.

Visiting Pan Gang, many people have the same feeling: Pan Gang people have an inner spiritual power. Pan Gang's general manager, Zhao Zhongyu, said: "Pan Gang is what we Chinese people have built through hard work and perseverance." A leader of a large steel plant sighed: "After seeing Pan Gang, I feel that Pan Gang people are truly remarkable. We must learn the spirit of Pan Gang people well."

To go global, one must not lose oneself, and in any situation, one must not forget the support of an enterprise.

Pan Gang's vanadium technology is unique in the world. The production of vanadium slag is the highest in the country. It not only ended China's history of importing vanadium slag but also made China, along with the Soviet Union and South Africa, one of the world's top three vanadium slag producers. Pan Gang people are proud of this. As General Manager Zhao Zhongyu said: "Do not belittle yourself. The moon in foreign countries is round, and the moon in China is not square."

However, Pan Gang people are not arrogant. Ten years of reform and opening up have broadened the horizons of Pan Gang people, making them see their own gaps and realizing that only by going global can the enterprise better survive and develop. In 1986, with the strong support of the central government, the second-phase project of Pan Gang was launched.

To speed up the process and narrow the technological gap, the second-phase project of Pan Gang introduced a batch of advanced technologies and equipment from abroad.

On May 8, 1987, to build the second-phase project, Pan Gang borrowed $210 million from abroad, becoming the first enterprise in China to build a project with foreign loans. In terms of opening up, Pan Gang's ambition is grand!

Along with the opening up came the impact and challenge to the Pan Gang spirit, which was equally huge.

General Manager Zhao Zhongyu of Pan Gang did not hide the temptation of the money-exchange view to Pan Gang people. He told us that Pan Gang is not an isolated vacuum zone, and there were once phenomena where people asked about bonuses before starting work, and notices for meetings on evenings or weekends asked about meals and souvenirs. This leader of a large enterprise reflected on the past and said with deep feelings: "If we only rely on money to motivate enthusiasm, the cost will become higher and higher. In the past, giving a 'big yuan' would make people very happy, but now it takes 'old man's ticket'—100 yuan to make people happy, yet we are still a backward country! Therefore, we must emphasize the spirit of hard work and perseverance."

The second-phase project of Pan Gang is built with foreign loans, and the 56,000 Pan Gang people all know that time is money. To build the No. 4 blast furnace, the company leaders and relevant engineering and technical personnel did not rest for 104 Sundays, without earning a penny in bonuses. A company official commented on such behavior: "China's takeoff is difficult, and takeoff requires some people to make sacrifices. We are not resting on Sundays now, precisely so that people can live and rest better in the future."

The remote and secluded environment can no longer hinder Pan Gang people's steps towards the world. Pan Gang people's goals are grand, but they know that going global is not achieved through grand words but depends on their own efforts.

The Swiss fans introduced in Pan Gang's second-phase project are key equipment for the blast furnace system, with advanced technology, complex processes, and high automation. Last October, Swiss experts came to Pan Gang and declared: "Without us, it cannot be installed. Without our participation in debugging, it cannot be put into production." Pan Gang people did not believe in superstition, did not spend a high price to invite foreign experts, and relied on their own strength to organize a breakthrough, spending half a year to make the two imported fans run smoothly.

The self-reliant spirit of Pan Gang was once again demonstrated.

Through these years of reform and opening up, Pan Gang people have drawn a conclusion: for an enterprise to develop, there are two basic points, and neglecting either is not acceptable. Opening up without self-reliance will make the enterprise closed and self-sufficient; opening up without self-reliance will make the enterprise lose its support.

Walking into Pan Gang, "Made in China" machines are seen everywhere, making people proud. But Pan Gang people are very clear about the gaps. Liu Nanping, a graduate of Kunming University of Science and Technology in 1983, is a volunteer who came to Pan Gang. This university student who understands advanced steelmaking technology from abroad thought: "This is a steel plant designed and manufactured by our country. Now the technology level is not very advanced. This is precisely what our generation needs to do." Huang Luohua, a graduate of Chongqing University in 1982, added: "Working in an enterprise like Pan Gang is very honorable. Sometimes it is very hard, but seeing the iron water flowing, it feels very proud, which is something that money cannot replace."

The future of Pan Gang is bright. The Pan Gang spirit has already been infused into the young blood of the new generation of Pan Gang people.

    攀钢精神
    陈华　周平
    川滇交界的金沙江畔。
    湍急的江水，孤零零的山。
    25年前，一批拓荒者来到这里。面对崇山峻岭，他们的回答是：弄弄平（坪）。以后，就在这片2.5平方公里的土地上，中国人摆下了一个年产150万吨钢的综合生产能力的大型钢铁联合企业——攀钢。
    25年过去了。这个我国唯一的自行设计、安装、生产的钢铁联合企业回答了世人的三个疑问：
    一、它不是一个试验厂；二、中国人建的钢厂同样能够达到设计水平；三、达到设计水平后，效益仍能继续提高。
    如今，攀钢正在建设二期工程，这将使它的生产能力扩大到250万吨钢。那时，攀钢的吨钢占地面积只有1平方米。
    面对这座“象牙微雕钢城”，研究中国钢铁工业的外国专家惊叹：这是中国钢铁工业的骄傲！
    一个国家、一个民族、一个企业没有一种精神是可怕的、危险的、没有前途的
    这是攀钢人从创业实践中得出的结论。
    “天是罗帐地是床，金沙江边运水忙，三块石头架口锅，酱油盐巴下干粮。”攀钢的青年一代今天已很难从这句顺口溜中遥想到往日创业的情境。可对于攀钢的第一代建设者来说，那却是一段难以忘怀的记忆。
    53岁的提钒炼钢厂厂长李志，1967年来到这个叫渡口（今攀枝花市）的地方时还是一个年青人。“那时我们撂下行李就搭席棚，喝黄水”。他操着北方口音细说着往事。这里伏天4个月，出门就爬坡，成昆铁路未修通时，设备、生活用品全靠汽车运。
    为了民族自尊，数万建设者撇下父母和妻儿，头顶烈日，脚踏荒原，喊出了“不想爹、不想妈、不出铁、不回家”的口号。
    攀钢第一代建设者满怀政治热情，抱定要在这片不毛之地谱写自己青春的诗章。
    建安公司是攀钢的一个下属单位，负责攀钢的民用生活设施的建筑安装。过去，攀钢同许多大型工程建设一样“先生产，后生活，有生产，没生活”。到了80年代，能否迅速改善生活环境？担子落到建安的头上。为了孔雀不再东南飞，建安职工头顶烈日，脚踏荒原“一砖一抹”，每年奉献5万多平方米的居民楼。看着大楼一幢幢起来，建安工人心里高兴。攀钢第一线工人大都住得较好了，可建安工人住的却不好，没有厂房，流动性大，加之野外工作，艰苦可想而知。省劳动卫生研究所去年在这儿测定，建筑工的劳动强度是最大的。而讲奖金比第一线工人低，难怪有的青工发点牢骚。牢骚归牢骚，可到了动真格的时候，建安人顶着上。今年建安公司接受了攀一中近一万平米校舍的施工任务，不到半年就完成了。按设计，这样短的时间是难以完成的。可工人们为了攀钢的教育，冒着40℃的高温，排除动乱的干扰，奖金没多拿一分钱，硬是干成了。公司经理于庆年感慨地说：“没有‘辛苦我一人，幸福千万家’的建安精神，没有艰苦奋斗，在这里要想生存和发展是不行的。建安精神正是攀钢精神的具体体现。”
    攀钢精神使攀钢迈出了自己坚实的三步，实现了三个第一：从建设到投产，攀钢用了5年时间，这在我国是第一家；从投产到达到设计水平用了10年，是全国第一家；还有效益，1981年至1985年是攀钢腾飞时期，共盈利14亿元，相当于国家对攀钢一期工程的总投资。攀钢从投产到还本用了15年时间，也是全国第一家。
    来到攀钢，不少人都有这样的感受，攀钢人有一种内在的精神力量。攀钢总经理赵忠玉讲了这样一句话：“攀钢是我们中国人自己艰苦奋斗干出来的。”一位大钢厂的领导同志对此十分感慨：“我看了攀钢后，觉得攀钢人很了不起，我们一定要好好学习攀钢人的精神。”
    走向世界不能失去自我，在任何情况下，不要忘记一个企业的支撑点
    攀钢的提钒技术在世界上是独具特色的，钒渣产量是全国第一，它不仅结束了我国钒渣进口的历史，而且使中国与苏联、南非一道成为世界3大钒渣生产国。对此，攀钢人很自豪，照赵忠玉总经理的话讲：“不要妄自菲薄，外国的月亮是圆的，中国的月亮也不是方的。”
    但攀钢人却不自大。十年改革开放，打开了攀钢人的视野，看到了自己的差距，意识到只有走向世界，企业才能更好地生存与发展。1986年，在中央的大力支持下，攀钢二期工程上马了。
    为了加快进程，缩短技术差距，攀钢二期工程引进了国外的一批先进技术设备。
    1987年5月8日，为建设二期工程，攀钢向国外借资2.1亿美元，成为中国第一家借外资建设工程的企业。对外开放，攀钢的气魄是宏大的！
    伴随开放而来的对攀钢精神的冲击和挑战同样是巨大的。
    攀钢总经理赵忠玉并不讳言金钱交换观对攀钢人的诱惑。他告诉我们，攀钢不是与世隔绝的真空地带，这里也一度出现过干工作前先问多少奖金，通知干部晚上或星期天来开会要问吃不吃饭，发不发纪念品等现象。这位大企业的领导反思过去，深有感触的说：“如果只靠金钱来调动积极性，代价将越来越高。过去发一张“大团结”就很高兴，如今要“老头儿票”——100元才行，可我们还是很落后的国家啊！所以还要强调艰苦奋斗精神。”
    攀钢的二期工程是借外债搞建设，56000攀钢人谁都知道，时间就是效益。为了建4号高炉，公司领导和有关工程技术人员104个星期日没有休息，没拿一分钱的奖金。一位公司负责人对这样的行为作了注释：“中国的起飞很难，起飞总要一些人作点牺牲。我们现在星期天不休息，正是为了将来人们生活、休息得更好。”
    偏远闭塞的环境已不能阻碍攀钢人走向世界的脚步，攀钢人的目标是远大的，但他们知道走向世界不是靠豪言壮语，而是取决于自己每一步努力。
    攀钢二期工程引进的瑞士风机是高炉系统的关键设备，技术先进，工艺复杂，自动化程度高。去年10月，瑞士专家来到攀钢断言：没有他们，安装不了。没有他们参与调试，投不了产。攀钢人不信邪，没有花高昂的费用请外国专家，依靠自己的力量组织攻关，历经半年时间，终于使两台进口风机顺利运转起来。
    攀钢的自力更生精神又一次得到了体现。
    通过这些年的改革开放，攀钢人得出了一个结论：企业要发展，两个基本点，偏废一点都不行。离开了对外开放的自力更生，只能使企业变得封闭自足；离开了自力更生的对外开放，则使企业丧失了存在的支撑点。
    走进攀钢，“中国制造”的机器随处可见，令人自豪。但攀钢人很清醒，看到了差距所在。83届昆明工学院毕业生刘南平是志愿来攀钢的，这个了解国外先进科学炼钢技术的大学生想到：“这是我国自己设计制造的钢厂，现在技术水平还不很先进，这正是需要我们这一代去干吗？”82届重大毕业生黄碌华补充道：“在攀钢这样的企业干是很荣耀的，有时干得很苦，可看到铁水奔流，觉得很自豪，这是金钱替代不了的。”
    攀钢的明天是美好的。攀钢精神已经溶入新一代攀钢人年轻的血液。
