After reading Tang Shiji's novel "Strange People of the Mud Boat" (published in the 20th issue of "Novels" by Beijing October Literature Publishing House), one cannot help but draw certain associations.

"Strange People of the Mud Boat" tells the story of a university graduate named Tang Lifeng who voluntarily goes to the Mud Boat railway section to work as a track maintenance worker, entering this "beautiful yet lonely" mountain village and meeting a group of "strange people of the Mud Boat."

Considering the historical context of the "Cultural Revolution," this novel should be a work that exposes "wounds" and denounces persecution. Although Tang Lifeng is said to have "volunteered," it is inevitable that there is an element of being "exiled" by the times. Or, considering Mud Boat as a "paradise on earth," it should naturally be written as a beautiful and moving "roots-seeking" story, with some strange and ethereal modern myths. Either of these "approaches" can be said to be natural and inevitable. Because everyone naturally thinks this way and naturally writes this way.

But "Strange People of the Mud Boat" is not like this.

"Strange People of the Mud Boat" also writes about "myths," such as the birth of Mud Boat and the forty-nine days of heavy rain, but its main focus is on depicting extremely plain, mundane, true, and simple life. It also writes about "reality," but not the kind of reality that is a conceptual derivation of political changes of the times, but rather the existence and struggle of life with a mythical color and natural wildness. Therefore, "Strange People of the Mud Boat" shows its unique character.

"Don't say the wind has no feet,
It runs wild all over the mountains and fields!
Don't say the wind has no hands,
It shakes the big trees!
Don't say the wind has no color,
It blows the emperor's hair white!
Don't say the wind has no eyes,
It chases away the clouds and mist on the ground!
If you have something to say, let the wind carry the message;
If you have something to do, follow the wind back..."

This is the song of the people of Mud Boat.

This is the "Song of Mud Boat," and it is also the song of life; it is a song of loneliness, and it is also a song of beauty.

Don't say Mud Boat is a paradise on earth; it is also like the "outside world," with everything of the time and the world. Such as struggle meetings, political study sessions, exposure, criticism, class division, and also jealousy, framing, striking back, revenge, and even murder. But all of these, compared to the beauty, nature, seclusion, and the wild chrysanthemums all over the mountains of Mud Boat, the thriving human nature and vitality, and the natural and simple human emotions and life scenes, all show their unpopular essence. Everything is diluted, everything is transformed. The people of Mud Boat can turn a struggle meeting into a mass entertainment, and can treat a private affair between a man and a woman as a moral crime, and then treat it as a very beautiful legend.

This is Mud Boat, and this is the strange people of Mud Boat. Fresh and natural Mud Boat, simple and ignorant people of Mud Boat. All of these make up a mythical reality and a real myth. Light and heavy, virtual and real, true and illusory. Beautiful and ugly, simple and ignorant, secluded and "open," poor and rich, truly "when falsehood becomes truth, truth becomes falsehood, when nothing becomes something, something becomes nothing."

Qiu Ju Hua—stinky chrysanthemum—is it beautiful or ugly? Is it fragrant or stinky? Is it evil or good? Her ignorance and misfortune of her first love, which is half rape and half voluntary, her numbness and indifference to her marriage, which is half resignation and half satisfaction, her passionate and brave love, which is half conscious and half instinctive... Is it fortunate or unfortunate, should or should not, beautiful or not beautiful? These things should be clear, but they are strangely unclear. As one of the main characters of "Strange People of Mud Boat," her story is the most charming and representative. The story of life, the story of life, the story of youth, the story of love... all become one story: the story of life.

Mud Boat is a field of life. "Strange People of Mud Boat" is a poem of life. Just as at the end of the novel, Tang Lifeng, who reluctantly bids farewell, realizes: "A village, a group of mountain people; a railway, a small station; a small river, a mud boat—perhaps, this is history?"

Yes, this is history, the history of life. It is also poetry, the poetry of life. What is more beautiful, more solemn, more painful, and more brilliant than the history of life and the poetry of life?

    读长篇小说《土船异人》
    陈墨
    读完汤世杰的长篇小说《土船异人》（载北京十月文艺出版社《长篇小说》第20辑），总会不期然地引起某种联想。
      《土船异人》是写一个名叫唐立文的大学毕业生自愿到土船铁路工区来做养路工，进入了这个“美丽得叫人寂寞”的山寨，结识了这么一批“土船异人”。
    考虑到当时“文化大革命”这样的时代背景，这部小说应该是一部揭示“伤痕”，控诉迫害的作品。唐立文虽说是“自愿”，总不免有大势所趋、时代使然的“发配”之实。或者，考虑到土船这样的“世外桃源”，应该自然而然地写成一个优美绝伦的“寻根”的故事，一些奇异缥缈的现代神话。——这两种“思路”无论哪一种都可以说是自然而然。因为大家都是自然而然地这么想，也是自然而然地这么写。
    但《土船异人》却并不。
      《土船异人》虽也写“神话”，比如土船的诞生以及七七四十九天大雨之类，然而它的主要的笔墨则是用来描摹极平实、极凡俗、极真实、极朴素的人生。它也写“现实”，但并不是有关时代政治风云变幻的概念演绎的真实，而是一些带有神话色彩、带着自然野性的生命的存在与搏击。因而，《土船异人》就显出了它特异的品格。
    “莫说风没有脚，／它会满山满野乱跑哩！／莫说风没有手，它会摇得大树乱晃哩！／莫说风没颜色，／它会吹得皇上头发白哩！／莫说风没眼睛，／它会撵得地上云雾开哩！／有话，你就托风捎个信来；／有事，你就跟风一起回来……。”这是土船人唱的歌。
    这是“土船之歌”，也是生命之歌；是寂寞的歌，也是美丽的歌。
    莫说土船是世外桃源，它也和“世内”一样，有当时当世的一切。诸如斗争会、政治学习、揭发、批判、阶级划分，还有嫉妒、陷害、打击、报复、甚至杀人。但所有的这一切，与土船的美丽、自然、闭塞、漫山遍野的臭菊花，蓬勃生长的人性与生命力，自然纯朴的人情与人生图景相比，都显出了其不得人心的实质。一切都被淡化，一切都被改造了。土船人能把一场批斗会变成一场群众性娱乐，又能把一桩男女私情当成一种道德犯罪，然后又把它当成一种极美丽的传说。
    这就是土船，这就是土船异人。清新自然的土船，纯朴蒙昧的土船人。所有的这一切，组成一种神话般的真实，和一个真实的神话。淡淡浓浓、虚虚实实、真真幻幻。美丽又丑陋，纯朴又蒙昧，闭塞又“开放”，贫穷又富有，真正是“假做真时真亦假，无为有处有还无”。
    仇菊华——臭菊花，是美是丑？是香是臭？是恶是善？她的蒙昧与不幸的半是强奸、半是自愿的
  “初恋”，她的麻木与平淡的半是无奈、半是欣慰的婚姻，她的热烈与勇敢的半是自觉、半是本能的爱情……究竟是幸与不幸、该与不该、美与不美？这些，应该说得清，偏偏却道不明。做为《土船异人》的主人公之一，她的故事最具魅力、也最具代表性。生活的故事、人生的故事、青春的故事、爱情的故事……在这里都变成了一个故事：生命的故事。
    土船是一块生命之场。《土船异人》正是一曲生命之诗。正如小说结尾处，依依不舍而别的唐立文感悟到了：“一个寨子，一群山民；一条铁路，一个小站；一条小河，一个土船——或许，这就是历史？”
    是的，这就是历史，生命的历史。也就是诗，生命之诗。还有什么比生命的历史与生命之诗更美、更庄严、更痛苦、更灿烂的么？
