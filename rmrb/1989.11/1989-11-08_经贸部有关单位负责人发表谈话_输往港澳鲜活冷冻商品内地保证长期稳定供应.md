Recently, there have been rumors in Hong Kong and Macau that the mainland has stopped supplying fresh and frozen goods to these regions. A reporter from this news agency recently interviewed officials from the relevant units of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade. The official expressed the commitment to ensure a long-term stable supply of fresh and frozen goods to Hong Kong and Macau.

He said, the fresh and frozen goods supplied by the mainland to Hong Kong and Macau are essential items for the daily lives of compatriots in these regions. Since the founding of New China, the Party and the government have always attached great importance to the supply work for Hong Kong and Macau. During the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, the railway transportation in some areas was temporarily disrupted. However, relevant departments quickly took measures to organize nearby supplies while clearing the routes, ensuring that the export transportation of fresh and frozen goods to Hong Kong and Macau was not affected.

The official introduced that the fresh and frozen goods supplied by the mainland to Hong Kong and Macau (including live livestock and poultry, frozen meat and poultry, eggs, aquatic products, fruits, and vegetables) continue to dominate the market in Hong Kong and Macau. The export situation in the first nine months of this year was normal. Among them, the sales volume of major commodities was stable and increasing. The sales volume of live pigs supplied to Hong Kong was 1.633 million heads, accounting for 97.85% of the total market sales volume; the sales volume of live cattle was 123,600 heads, accounting for 99.8% of the total market sales volume. The sales volume of live medium-sized pigs and live piglets increased to varying degrees compared to the same period last year; the sales volume of frozen pork in the first nine months was 23,800 tons, an increase of 2,000 tons compared to the same period last year, with an increase of 9%. The market share of other varieties is also relatively large, such as live carp accounting for 95%, live poultry and vegetables accounting for 60%.

    经贸部有关单位负责人发表谈话
    输往港澳鲜活冷冻商品内地保证长期稳定供应
    据新华社北京11月7日电  最近，港澳地区谣传说内地停止对港澳地区鲜活冷冻商品的供应，本社记者日前就此采访了对外经济贸易部有关单位的负责人。这位负责人表示要保证对港澳地区鲜活冷冻商品的长期稳定供应。
    他说，内地供应港澳的鲜活冷冻商品，是港澳同胞日常生活必需品。新中国成立以来，党和政府对港澳供应工作一直十分重视。前不久北京发生动乱和反革命暴乱期间，部分地区的铁路运输一度暂短中断，由于有关方面迅速采取措施，在疏通线路的同时，临时就近组织货源，供应港澳的鲜活冷冻商品的出口运输也没有受到影响。
    这位负责人介绍说，内地供应港澳的鲜活冷冻商品（包括活畜禽、冻肉禽、蛋品、水产品、水果、蔬菜等）在港澳市场继续占主导地位，今年头9个月出口情况正常。其中大宗商品销量稳中有升，供港活大猪销售量为163.3万头，占当地市场总销量的97.85％；活牛销量为12.36万头，占市场总销量的99.8％，活中猪、活乳猪的销量比去年同期均有不同程度的增加；冻猪肉头9个月销港2.38万吨，比去年同期增加2000吨，增幅为9％。其他品种占市场比重也较大，如活塘鱼占95％，活家禽、蔬菜占60％。
