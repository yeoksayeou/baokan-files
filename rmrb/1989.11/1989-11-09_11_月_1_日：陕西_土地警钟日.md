	The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have decided to designate November 1st of each year as "Land Alarm Day" and the entire month of November as "Land Management Law Propaganda Month." The effectiveness of land management will be a key factor in evaluating the performance of officials.

	Leaders of Shaanxi Province recently sounded the alarm on the severe land situation at a meeting with the people of the province: Since the founding of the People's Republic, the province has lost 12.51 million mu of arable land. Between 1981 and 1988 alone, 3.97 million mu were lost, averaging 496,000 mu per year. During the same period, the population increased by 18.18 million, an average annual increase of 450,000 people. This has reduced the per capita arable land from 5 mu in 1949 to 1.7 mu in 1988. After careful analysis, it has been determined that the province's arable land carrying capacity has reached the warning line.

    11月1日：陕西“土地警钟日”
    本报西安电　记者孟西安报道：陕西省委、省政府作出决定，从今年开始，将每年11月1日定为“土地警钟日”，将每年的11月份定为“《土地管理法》宣传月”，并把土地管理工作的好坏，作为考核干部政绩的重要内容。
    陕西省的领导同志前不久在一次会上向全省人民敲响土地形势严峻的警钟：建国以来，全省净减少耕地1251万亩，仅1981年至1988年就减少397万亩，年均减少49.6万亩，而建国以来人口却增加1818万人，平均每年净增45万多人，使人均占有耕地由1949年的5亩，减少到1988年的1.7亩。经论证，全省耕地承载量已到警戒线。
