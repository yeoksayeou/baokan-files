The political department of a certain unit in the Beijing Military Region actively organized cultural and entertainment activities suitable for young soldiers, proactively occupying the ideological and cultural front, and achieved remarkable results.

While doing a good job of cleaning up and confiscating unhealthy books and audio-visual products, the unit organized book review discussions, good book lectures, healthy song singing competitions, calligraphy and painting competitions, and held basketball, chess, and go competitions in the subordinate units, enriching the cultural and entertainment activities of the soldiers outside of their eight-hour workday. The unit also allocated over 50,000 yuan from production revenue to purchase 12,000 copies of healthy books for distribution to the units, re-recorded a batch of healthy and spirited revolutionary songs suitable for military camps, and sent them to the units. Additionally, the unit purchased and distributed cultural and entertainment equipment worth over 100,000 yuan, including billiards, table tennis, electronic keyboards, and leisure chess, to the grassroots companies. This has resulted in the unit having a culture of reading good books, engaging in healthy and uplifting activities, and enjoying a rich and diverse cultural life.
