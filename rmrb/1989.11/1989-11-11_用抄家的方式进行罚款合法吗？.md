Is it legal to impose fines by confiscating property?

Editor,

If township and village cadres, under the pretext of collecting fines, seize household items such as drying mats, bamboo mats, thermos flasks, steel pots, buckets, ladles, and even pigs, remove doors, and on the way, seize bicycles, ducks, and geese, is this kind of fine-imposing and property-seizing behavior legal?

Dongfeng Village Committee Liujia Village Liu Haoliang and others

Liu Haoliang and others,

We have not verified the situation you reported. We will respond to the issues raised in your letter as follows:

Township and village cadres imposing fines according to regulations and within their authority is their duty. Those who should indeed be fined must support this, and cannot use excuses to evade responsibility for their wrongdoings.

However, rural cadres must strictly follow the law when executing fines. Article 39 of the Constitution states:

"The homes of citizens of the People's Republic of China are inviolable. Illegal searches or illegal entry into citizens' homes are prohibited." Article 75, paragraph 2 of the General Principles of Civil Law states:

"The lawful property of citizens is protected by law. Any organization or individual shall not seize, plunder, damage, or illegally seal, detain, freeze, or confiscate it." Article 137 of the Criminal Law states: "It is strictly forbidden to engage in 'smashing, looting, and burning' in groups." It is undeniable that no law, decree, or regulation in our country grants any organization or individual the power to illegally invade the lawful property of citizens without legal procedures. If a citizen violates certain regulations and should be fined, the citizen should follow the law and voluntarily pay the fine. Those executing the fine should be relevant departments authorized by law to enforce the law, and they should follow certain legal procedures to collect fines from law-breaking citizens. Local governments at the township level, without the authority to execute fines, cannot exercise this power that should be exercised by law enforcement agencies. If a citizen resists paying fines and should be punished, only law enforcement agencies can legally punish the law-breaking citizen according to legal procedures, rather than township and village cadres using the "cultural revolution" method of confiscating property to arbitrarily invade the other lawful property of citizens. The behavior of abusing power, creating excuses, and arbitrarily imposing fines on citizens, and using fines as an excuse to confiscate citizens' property, is a violation of citizens' personal rights and property rights.

### 用抄家的方式进行罚款合法吗？

     用抄家的方式进行罚款合法吗？编辑同志：
    乡、村干部如果以收罚款为名，将农户家中的财物，如晒垫、篾席、热水瓶、钢精锅、水桶、粥勺等抄抢走，甚至还捆走生猪，卸走大门、房间门，半路抢自行车、捉抢鸭鹅。请问这种罚款抄家行为是否合法？
          江西吉水县尚贤乡
          东风村委会刘家村　刘浩亮等刘浩亮等同志：
    你们反映的情况我们没有核实，现就来信提及的情节答复如下：
    乡、村干部依照规定和权限进行罚款，这是他们的职责。确实应该受罚的群众一定要支持，不能因为自己本来做错了事而寻找借口逃脱责任。
    但农村干部在执行罚款公务时，必须严格遵守法律。宪法第39条规定：
  “中华人民共和国公民的住宅不受侵犯。禁止非法搜查或者非法侵入公民的住宅。”民法通则第75条第二款规定：
  “公民的合法财产受法律保护，禁止任何组织或者个人侵占、哄抢、破坏或者非法查封、扣押、冻结、没收。”刑法第137条规定：“严禁聚众‘打砸抢’。”不容置疑，我国任何法律、法令、法规，都没有赋予任何组织和个人不经法律程序，非法侵犯公民合法财产的权力。如果公民因违反某些法规，应当受到罚款处罚的，公民应遵守法律规定，主动缴纳罚款。而执行罚款决定的，应是法律赋予了执法权力的有关部门，并应遵循一定的法律程序对违法公民收缴罚款。地方如乡一级政府，在法律没有赋予执行罚款决定权力的情况下，就不能行使这种应由执法机关行使的权力。如果公民因抗拒缴纳罚款而应受到一定惩处时，也只能由执法机关依照法定程序依法对违法公民给予适当的惩处，而不能由乡、村干部以“文革”中的抄家形式，肆意侵犯公民的其它合法财产。那种滥用职权，巧立名目，随意对公民施以罚款，并以罚款为名，抄抢公民家产的行为，更是对公民的人身权利、财产权利的侵犯。
