Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, November 18th.

The Jinan Railway Bureau has determined the cause of a major fire on a railway bridge within the jurisdiction of the Xuzhou Division of the Beijing-Shanghai line and has severely punished the parties responsible for the accident.

At 18:30 on October 30, a major fire occurred on a railway bridge between the stations of Qianting and Liguo within the jurisdiction of the Xuzhou Division. This accident resulted in the suspension of train services on the Beijing-Shanghai line for nearly 19 hours in the upward direction and 25 hours in the downward direction. The investigation revealed that the cause of the accident was the failure of Zhang Zhiyin, the foreman of the third construction team of the bridge and tunnel repair section of the bureau, to take effective fire prevention measures during the inspection and repair of the bridge, leaving fire hazards. When the fire started, the two workers responsible for patrolling the bridge also left their posts, missing the opportunity to extinguish the fire.

The Jinan Railway Bureau has recently decided to: remove Zhang Zhiyin from his position as foreman, expel him from the railway, and place him under observation for one year; give the two workers a major demerit and demote them; and give appropriate punishments to the five officials who bear leadership responsibility.

    京沪线铁路桥火灾原因查清
    事故责任者受到严肃处理
    新华社济南11月18日电 （通讯员王富森、王建国）济南铁路局已经查明京沪线上徐州分局管内一铁路桥发生重大火灾事故的原因，并对事故责任者进行了严肃处理。
    10月30日18时30分，徐州分局管内前亭站与利国站之间的一座铁路桥发生重大火灾。由于这次事故，造成京沪线上行车中断近19小时，下行车中断25小时。经调查，事故原因是：路局所属桥隧大修段第三施工队工长张之银，在带领职工对大桥进行检修作业时，没有采取有效防火措施，留下火灾隐患。火刚着时，负责桥梁巡守的两名工人又擅离职守，贻误了灭火时机。
    济南铁路局日前做出决定：对张之银给予撤销工长职务、开除路籍、留路察看一年处分；对两名工人给予行政记大过和降级处分；对负有领导责任的5名干部，分别给予处分。
