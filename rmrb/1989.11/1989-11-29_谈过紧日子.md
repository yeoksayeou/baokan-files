The Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China calls on all Party members, cadres, and the people to inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of hard work and thrift in building the country, to "make a firm decision to tighten our belts for a few years," to overcome the current economic difficulties, and to achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy. This is an important guiding principle.

Why do we need to tighten our belts, and how should we do it? Many cadres and the masses are concerned about this issue and have discussed it extensively. Therefore, Party organizations at all levels must go deep among the masses, propagate among the masses, explain the situation, and consider the overall picture. While fully affirming the tremendous achievements made in reform and opening up over the past decade, we must also honestly explain our national conditions, national strength, and the current temporary difficulties. In this way, we can unite everyone's thoughts with the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

Tightening our belts for a few years is an objective requirement of our country's economic situation and the only correct choice for overcoming difficulties, readjusting relationships, and making economic work return to a healthy development path. All Party comrades, especially the leading cadres at all levels of the Party, must have a clear understanding of this. The current economic difficulties have accumulated over many years. One prominent problem is that the economy has been "overheating" for many years, with investment demand and consumption demand expanding rapidly, and the existing national strength and social productive capacity unable to support such a large scale of construction and the ever-growing consumption demand. This overheating trend seems prosperous, but it cannot be sustained. Eventually, problems will surface. As everyone has seen, inflation, rising prices—if this continues, the achievements of construction and reform that have been made will be difficult to consolidate, and the national economy may fall into a vicious cycle, which is very worrying. What should we do? It is imperative to tighten, cool down, and compress. The enthusiasm of comrades in various places for construction is high, and they hope to move forward faster. This sentiment is understandable. But we must never forget our basic national conditions and the principle of building according to our capacity. "Haste makes waste," and we cannot afford to be impatient for quick results again. After tightening, the development speed will inevitably slow down, and certain aspects and certain localities may have to endure some pain, but from a long-term and overall perspective, this is necessary. If we do not do this, construction and reform will not stand, and even more serious and difficult situations may arise.

The practice of tightening our belts has actually been in effect since the Thirteenth Central Committee proposed the policy of rectification and deepening reform at its Third Plenary Session. After a year of work, fixed asset investment has been controlled, the upward trend of price increases has slowed, and the overly high industrial development speed has been reduced. It can be said that the rectification and deepening of reform have achieved initial results. In this situation, some comrades are calling for an end to the "tightening" and hoping for relaxation in all aspects. It is necessary to adjust according to time, place, and conditions, and to relax certain aspects in certain times and places, but overall, we must still maintain a tight stance. We must learn from the historical lesson that once we tighten, there are calls to relax, and once we relax, we open up again.

In tightening our belts for a few years, the first thing to do is to reflect this in economic construction. All regions and departments must resolutely shift economic work to the track of focusing on improving economic efficiency, truly invest great efforts in adjusting product structure, improving management, promoting technological progress, and taking the path of high efficiency with low investment and high output. This requires the formulation of effective measures to concretize and implement the requirements of reducing costs, saving resources, improving quality, and reducing capital occupation. It is necessary to mobilize the broad masses of workers to carry out the movement of increasing production and saving resources in a down-to-earth and thorough manner. As long as we do this seriously, tightening our belts will become a driving force for work.

An extremely important aspect of tightening our belts for a few years is to control social purchasing power. In recent years, the rapid growth of social consumption demand is closely related to the rapid expansion of social purchasing power. There is great potential to compress social purchasing power. Money that can be spent or not spent should not be spent. Decoration of offices, procurement of high-end office supplies, official trips, and official banquets must be firmly cut off. By compressing this part of the expenditure, not only can waste be eliminated, funds accumulated, and construction supported, but it can also help promote clean governance and strengthen the Party and government's ties with the people. Over the past year, the compression of social purchasing power has achieved initial results, and this work must continue to be grasped tightly.

Does tightening our belts for a few years mean restricting the legitimate consumption of the broad masses? Certainly not. Food, clothing, and daily necessities, the state will strive to ensure and do its best to improve. Does this mean that the people's living standards will decline? This is not the case. Some projects will be halted, and some factories will be closed and reorganized, which may reduce workers' bonuses and income; we must do everything possible to help these workers find a way out and arrange their lives well; but overall, the people's lives are guaranteed. In recent years, the Party and the government have spared no effort to improve the living standards of the people. Given the situation of slow personal income growth and a large debt over a long period in the past, the government has already done its utmost to increase the proportion of residents' income in national income. Over the past decade, the improvement in the living standards of urban and rural residents is evident. During the period of rectification and deepening of reform, China's economy will still maintain a certain growth rate, and our lives will continue to improve, which is beyond doubt. The key is that our national strength is still not strong, and we cannot compete in consumption or blindly pursue "high consumption" that is detached from national conditions. Our national conditions are such that we must eat our fill but not eat too well; if we want to eat our fill and eat well in the future, we must tighten our belts now to free up funds for construction and production, which is the fundamental way to improve our lives. Hard work is a virtue of the Chinese nation and also a fine tradition of our Party, which we must continue to carry forward in new circumstances. We must continue to promote thrift and oppose the trend of extravagance and waste.

In a country like China, with a large population and a backward economy, it is impossible to build socialism without several decades of hard work. In this sense, the idea of tightening our belts should be advocated all the time.

In tightening our belts, all Party members, especially leading cadres, must set an example. Whatever is required of the masses, leading cadres, especially high-level leading cadres, must do it first; whatever is required of local areas, the central authorities must do it first. This is an economic issue, but more importantly, it is a political issue. How has our Party grown from small to large and from weak to strong, and gained the support of the people across the country? Apart from the correctness of the political line, it is because the broad masses of Party members and the people have shared weal and woe. This is our political advantage. Communist Party members, especially leading cadres, should always put hardship first and enjoyment last, and serve the people wholeheartedly. This is the case when facing temporary difficulties, and it will still be the case when our country becomes richer in the future. The living standards of Party members and cadres must improve with the living standards of the masses, which is an important principle of our Party.

### 谈过紧日子

　　谈过紧日子
    党的十三届五中全会号召广大党员、干部和人民群众，要继承和发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的光荣传统，“下决心过几年紧日子”，克服当前的经济困难，实现国民经济持续、稳定、协调的发展。这是一个重要的指导思想。
    为什么要过紧日子，怎样过紧日子？广大干部、群众对这个问题很关心，议论也很多。这就需要各级党组织深入群众，宣传群众，讲形势，看大局，在充分肯定十年多来改革开放取得巨大成就的同时，如实地将我们的国情、国力以及当前暂时的困难讲清楚。这样，就可以把大家的思想统一到党的十三届五中全会的精神上来。
    过几年紧日子，是我国经济状况的客观要求，是克服困难、理顺关系，使经济工作走上健康发展道路的唯一正确选择。对于这一点，全党同志尤其是党的各级领导干部一定要有清醒的认识。当前经济困难是多年积累下来的。其中一个突出的问题就是经济连续多年过“热”，投资需求和消费需求急剧膨胀，现有国力和社会生产能力无法支撑如此大的建设规模和日益增长的消费需求。这种过热的势头看起来很繁荣，但不能持久，到一定时候问题就暴露出来。正如大家所看到的那样，通货膨胀，物价上涨，这样下去，已取得的建设和改革的成果就很难巩固，而且会使国民经济陷入恶性循环，是很令人担忧的。怎么办？作必要的收紧、降温、压缩，是势在必行的。各地的同志建设热情很高，希望上的快一点，这种心情是可以理解的。但什么时候都不要忘记我们的基本国情，什么时候都不能忘记量力而行的建设原则。“欲速则不达”，我们不能再吃急于求成的亏了。紧缩后发展速度势必慢一些，某些方面、某些局部可能还要忍受一些痛苦，但从长远看，从全局看，这样做是必须的。不这样做，建设和改革就站不住脚，甚至会出现更严重、更困难的局面。
  过紧日子，实际上从党的十三届三中全会提出治理整顿、深化改革的方针以后就开始实行了。经过一年来的工作，固定资产投资有所控制，物价上涨势头趋于缓和，过高的工业发展速度降了下来。可以说，治理整顿已经取得初步成效。在这种情况下，有的同志叫唤不能再“紧”下去了，希望各方面都松动一下。一切以时间、地点、条件为转移，在某些时候、某些地方对某些方面松动一下，是必要的，但总的说来还是要从紧。一定要汲取一紧就叫，一叫就放开的历史教训。
    过几年紧日子，首先要在经济建设上体现。各地区、各部门要坚定不移地把经济工作转到以提高经济效益为中心的轨道上来，真正下大功夫调整产品结构，改进经营管理，促进技术进步，走投入少、产出多、效益高的经济发展路子。这就需要制定得力措施，把降低成本、减少消耗、提高质量、减少资金占用等要求具体化，层层落实。需要动员广大职工，扎扎实实地全面深入地开展增产节约、增收节支运动。只要认认真真这样做，过紧日子就成为推动工作的动力。
    过几年紧日子，一个非常重要的内容是控制社会集团购买力。前些年，社会消费需求增长过猛同社会集团购买力急剧膨胀是密切相关的。压缩社会集团购买力的潜力很大。可花可不花的钱，一律不花。装修办公室，配备高级办公用品，公费旅游，公费大吃大喝等，必须坚决砍掉。把这部分开支压下来，不仅可以杜绝浪费，积累资金，支援建设，而且有助于推进廉政建设，密切党和政府同群众的联系。一年来，压缩社会集团购买力已经取得初步成效，这方面的工作要继续抓紧、抓好。
    过几年紧日子，是不是要限制广大群众的正当消费？当然不是。吃的、穿的、用的，国家要努力保证，尽力搞好。是不是意味着人民的生活水平要下降？不能这样看。一些工程下马，一些工厂关停并转，职工的奖金、收入可能要减少；一定要千方百计帮助这部分职工找出路，把生活安排好；但从总体上说，人民的生活是有保障的。这些年来，党和政府为了提高人民群众的生活水平，花了很大心血。鉴于过去一个很长时期个人收入增长过慢，欠账太多的情况，政府已经尽最大可能提高了居民所得在国民收入中的比重。这十年来，城乡居民生活的改善是明显的。治理整顿期间，我国的经济还会保持一定的增长速度，我们的日子也会继续好起来，这是没有疑问的。重要的是，我们的国力毕竟还不雄厚，不能竞相攀比，盲目追求脱离国情的“高消费”。我们的国情就是这样，既要吃饱，又不能吃得太好；要想今后吃得饱又吃得好，现在只有紧一紧，腾出财力来搞建设，搞生产，这才是改善生活的根本途径。艰苦奋斗是中华民族的美德，也是我们党的优良传统，要在新的情况下继续发扬光大。我们还是要大兴勤俭之风，反对奢侈浪费的社会风气。
    在中国这样一个人口众多而又贫穷落后的大国建设社会主义，不经过几十年的艰苦奋斗是不行的。从这个意义上说，过紧日子的思想应该经常提倡。
    过紧日子，广大党员、党员干部特别是领导干部要作表率。凡是要求群众做到的，领导干部特别是高级领导干部首先要做到；凡是要求地方做到的，中央机关首先要做到。这是个经济问题，更是个政治问题。我们的党由小到大，由弱到强，受到全国人民的拥护，靠的是什么？除了政治路线的正确之外，就是靠广大党员和人民同甘共苦。这是我们的政治优势。共产党员尤其是党的领导干部，就是要吃苦在前、享受在后，全心全意为人民服务。遇到暂时困难时是这样，就是将来我们的国家富裕一些了也还是这样。党员、干部的生活必须随着群众生活提高而提高，这是我们党的一条重要原则。
