The scandal that rocked the nation over the former Housing Department is yet to be fully investigated, and recently another scandal, known as the "Keating Scandal," has surfaced. The House Banking Committee has held several hearings on the "Keating Scandal" and the roles played by five senators. Shockingly, this scandal will cause American taxpayers to suffer a loss of up to $2.5 billion.

In simple terms, the "Keating Scandal" refers to Charles Keating, the former head of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, who used his political influence in Congress and the White House to bypass relevant regulations and engage in real estate speculation, junk bonds, and other high-risk investments. This ultimately led to the collapse of the savings and loan association, with the federal government set to pay $2.5 billion to cover the losses. It has been revealed that to thank the five senators for their intervention, Keating raised $1.4 million in campaign funds for them.

Lincoln Savings and Loan Association is based in California. In early 1984, Keating bought this institution and appointed his son, who had not finished college, as the chairman. The savings and loan association should have primarily engaged in housing loan business, but Keating placed his bets on high-risk foreign exchange futures, junk bonds, stocks, hotel business, and real estate investments. At the time, Edwin Gray, the chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, was "shocked" by such high-risk investments in the savings and loan system and proposed certain management regulations, stipulating that the direct investments of savings and loan associations insured by the federal government should not exceed 10% of their total assets. Keating opposed this and lobbied Congress members to intervene, aiming to maintain his 40% direct investment ratio. However, his request was rejected by the federal management personnel. In 1986, federal management personnel investigated Lincoln Savings and Loan Association and found it not only had numerous management loopholes but also engaged in illegal activities. Keating countered these accusations, spending $50 million on legal fees alone.

On May 1, 1987, federal management personnel submitted a 285-page investigation report to Washington, listing various illegal activities of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. The report also suggested that the Federal Home Loan Bank take over Lincoln Savings and Loan Association and requested the FBI to investigate the illegal activities of the association. However, Washington took no action in the following two years. Why? This is the focus of public attention.

According to Gray's testimony, at the suggestion of Senator John Glenn, Senators Alan Cranston, Dennis DeConcini, John McCain, and Donald Riegle secretly met with Gray on April 2, 1987, on behalf of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, asking him to withdraw the regulations restricting direct investments. A week later, the five senators met with four federal management personnel under Gray. According to detailed records from that time, the five senators complained about the restrictions on direct investments, claiming that the investigators were too harsh on Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, urging federal management personnel to stop the investigation, and praising Keating and others for saving a savings and loan association on the brink of collapse. Before and after these two meetings, Keating generously donated a total of $1.4 million in campaign funds directly or indirectly to the five senators. Additionally, current Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan also spoke on behalf of Keating at the time.

Two years later, Lincoln Savings and Loan Association declared bankruptcy. Since the savings and loan association was insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, American taxpayers will pay $2.5 billion for the government's rescue operation.

However, the five senators all denied any involvement in the "Keating Scandal" and defended themselves by saying that their actions were entirely "for the service of their constituents." Currently, the FBI and Congress are investigating this case, and the development of the situation will undoubtedly attract the attention of the media. However, the general reaction of Americans is not strong; they seem to have become accustomed to such scandals.

Whether the "Keating Scandal" can be fully resolved remains to be seen, as Keating invoked his rights under the Fifth Amendment during the congressional hearing on November 21 and refused to answer questions.

### “基廷丑闻”与五名参议员

　　“基廷丑闻”与五名参议员
　　本报记者　张亮
    轰动美国全国的前住房部丑闻还未彻底查清，最近又爆出一桩所谓“基廷丑闻”。众议院银行委员会已就“基廷丑闻”及5名参议员在其中扮演过什么角色举行了几次听证会。令人惊愕的是，这一丑闻将使美国纳税人蒙受高达25亿美元的惨重损失。
    简单来说，“基廷丑闻”是指林肯储贷机构前老板基廷利用他在国会和白宫的政治影响，避开有关规章制度的限制而从事地产投机、垃圾债券和其它高风险投资，致使该储贷机构最后破产，联邦政府为之将付出25亿美元的高昂代价。据披露，为酬谢5名参议员的说情，基廷向他们募集了140万美元的竞选经费。
    林肯储贷机构设在加利福尼亚州。1984年初基廷买下这家储贷机构，并封未念完大学的儿子为董事长。储贷机构本应主要从事住房贷款业务，而基廷则把赌注下在风险很大的外汇期货交易、垃圾债券、股票、旅馆业和地产投资。当时任联邦住房贷款银行董事长的格雷对储贷系统的这种高风险投资感到“震惊”，并提议制定了某些管理条例，规定由联邦政府保险的储贷机构的直接投资不得超过其总资产的10％。基廷对此表示反对，并向国会议员游说，请求他们出面干预，以保持其40％的直接投资比例。但是，他的要求遭到联邦住房贷款银行管理人员的拒绝。1986年联邦管理人员曾对林肯储贷机构作过调查，发现它不仅在经营管理上漏洞百出，而且有违法行为。基廷对这些指控作了反击，仅律师费就花了5000万美元。
    1987年5月1日，联邦管理人员向华盛顿提交了一份长达285页的调查报告，除列举林肯储贷机构的多种违法行为外，该报告还建议联邦住房贷款银行接管林肯储贷机构，并要求联邦调查局对林肯储贷机构的违法行为进行调查。但是，在此后两年时间里，华盛顿一直未采取任何行动。何故？这正是人们关注的焦点。
    据格雷的证词，在黑格尔参议员的建议下，1987年4月2日参议员德孔西尼、麦凯恩、格伦和克兰斯顿曾代表林肯储贷机构秘密召见格雷，要求他撤销有关限制直接投资的规定。一个星期后，这5名参议员又召见了格雷手下的4名联邦管理人员。根据当时的详细记录，5名参议员对有关直接投资的限制提出报怨，声称调查人员对林肯储贷机构太严厉，敦促联邦管理人员停止调查等，并称赞基廷等人拯救了一个岌岌可危的储贷机构。在这两次会见前后，基廷慷慨解囊，总共为5名参议员直接或间接地募集了140万美元的竞选经费。此外，现任联邦储备委员会主席格林斯潘以及前白宫办公厅主任里甘当时也为基廷说过情。
    两年之后，林肯储贷机构宣告破产。由于该储贷机构享有联邦储贷保险公司的保险，美国纳税人将为政府的拯救行动付出25亿美元。
    但是，5名参议员都矢口否认与“基廷丑闻”有牵连，并辩解说他们的所作所为完全是“为选民服务”。目前，联邦调查局和国会正就此案进行调查，其事态发展无疑将受到舆论界的关注。而一般美国人的反应则并不强烈，他们对诸如此类的丑闻似乎已经习以为常了。
    “基廷丑闻”究竟能否弄个水落石出，看来还是一个问号，因为基廷在21日举行的国会听证会上援引宪法第5修正案赋予他的权利而拒绝回答问题。
