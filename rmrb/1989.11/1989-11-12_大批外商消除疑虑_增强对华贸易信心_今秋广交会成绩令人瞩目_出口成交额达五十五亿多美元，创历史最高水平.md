Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 10th.

The results of this autumn's Canton Fair are impressive, demonstrating China's commitment to reform and opening up, and its willingness to continue developing trade with countries and regions around the world. It also indicates a stable and promising future for China's foreign trade exports.

Statistics show that during the 15-day fair, 36,892 visitors from 98 countries and regions attended. Major customers were present. There was a significant increase in the number of businesspeople from countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Spain, Belgium, and Switzerland compared to the previous session. Many attendees expressed that China's situation was better than they had anticipated, boosting their confidence in developing trade with China. One American businessman said, "China is so vast, with so many resources; there must be business opportunities." An Italian businessman specializing in automobile parts said that this was his first visit with his wife, aiming to change the previous practice of purchasing Chinese goods through other importers. Many businesspeople mentioned that their observations in China dispelled the doubts they had before the fair due to certain media influences.

The 1,700-plus trade negotiation rooms at the fair were fully booked every day, and latecomers often had to wait in line outside. Fair staff reported that this session had fewer casual visitors and more serious business discussions and deals. Some businesspeople who initially did not plan to make deals came to understand the stable and vibrant society in China, leading to more business than in previous sessions. According to the fair's statistics department, the daily export transaction amount increased steadily after the opening, reaching over $700 million on the 10th day (October 24th), setting a new record for the highest daily transaction amount in the fair's history. Throughout the session, the export transaction amount recorded in the computer was $55.71 billion, achieving the best results in the fair's history. American and European businesspeople not only attended in large numbers but also placed orders quickly and made numerous deals. American businesspeople made nearly $5 billion in transactions, a 41% increase from the previous session. Businesspeople from the European Economic Community made over $6 billion in transactions, a 27% increase from the previous session.

Most products at this session were well-received, with named, high-quality, and new products being particularly favored by businesspeople. Out of the 16 trade delegations, 14, including arts and crafts, light industry, textiles, and electronics, saw increased export transaction amounts compared to the previous session. The joint venture trade delegation's transaction amount increased from $0.57 billion in the previous session to $1.03 billion in this session. Businesspeople commented that joint venture products have good quality, timely delivery, and high credibility. The newly formed special economic zone trade delegation, showcasing over 3,000 self-produced products in 10-plus categories, impressed attendees, with its export transaction amount ranking third among the 19 delegations, following textiles and light industry.

This session of the fair improved the transaction environment and order, strengthened transaction coordination management, and unified external relations, leaving a deep impression on the attending businesspeople. Businesspeople generally commented that the fair's environment was orderly, the transaction environment significantly improved, and the transaction order was the best in recent years, overcoming past issues such as too many domestic visitors, overcrowding, and even "street vending" within the fair. This reflects China's new image in managing the economic environment and rectifying economic order.

Some businesspeople also pointed out that there are too many foreign trade operating ports and companies in China, suggesting that some companies be closed during the rectification of foreign trade. One foreign businessman said, "This is my first visit to China, and it exceeded my expectations. I hope China can provide more opportunities for us to understand, learn about, and exchange with China." He expressed his intention to attend every session of the fair for the rest of his life.

    大批外商消除疑虑  增强对华贸易信心
    今秋广交会成绩令人瞩目
    出口成交额达五十五亿多美元，创历史最高水平
    据新华社广州11月10日电  （记者史美泗）成绩令人瞩目的今年秋季广交会，用生动具体的事实显示了我国坚持改革开放政策，愿意继续发展与世界各国、各地区的贸易往来；预示了我国外贸出口将继续稳定发展的前景。
    据统计，这届广交会在半个月的会期里，到会客商有98个国家和地区的36892人次，主要客户都来了。英国、加拿大、西班牙、比利时、瑞士等欧美国家的客商比上届有显著增多。许多客商表示，中国的形势比他们预料的好，增强了与中国发展贸易的信心。一位美商说：“中国那么大，物资那么多，总有生意可做。”一位专营汽车零件的意大利客商说，这次他携夫人首次来会，想一改以往通过其他进口商购买中国货的做法。许多客商说，来到中国后的所见所闻，消除了来会前因受某些舆论影响而产生的疑虑。
    广交会1700多个贸易洽谈室每天座无虚席，稍迟一点进馆的客商，往往只好坐在室外排队等候洽谈。广交会工作人员反映：这届广交会单纯询价、礼节性拜访的商人少，见面后立即进行实质性业务洽谈和成交的人多。一些商人本来不想成交，只想来了解一些情况，到了广州后看到社会稳定，充满生机，广交会也办得比往届好，生意反而做得比往届还多。据广交会统计部门介绍，这届广交会开幕后日出口成交额节节上升，第10天（10月24日）日成交额达到7亿多美元，创广交会日成交额最高纪录。在整个会期里，出口成交额输入计算机的有55.71亿美元，创历届广交会最好成绩。欧美商人不仅到会踊跃，而且下单快、成交多。美国商人成交近5亿美元，比上届增长41％；欧洲共同体的商人成交6亿多美元，比上届增加27％。
    这届广交会的多数商品都比较好销，名、优、新产品尤其得到客商青睐。16个交易团中，工艺、轻工、纺织、电子等14个交易团的出口成交额都比上届增加。中外合营企业交易团的成交额从上届的0.57亿美元增加到这届的1.03亿美元。客商反映，中外合营企业的产品质量好、交货及时、信誉高。这届广交会新组成的经济特区交易团，展销的以自产为主的十几大类3000多种产品令人刮目相看，出口成交额仅次于纺织、轻工交易团，在19个交易团中列第三。
    这届广交会整顿成交环境和秩序，加强成交的协调管理，统一对外，给与会商人留下了深刻的印象。客商们普遍反映这届广交会馆内秩序井然、成交环境明显改善，成交秩序是近几年来最好的一届，克服了过去那种国内进馆人员过多、拥挤不堪，甚至在会上“摆小摊”等不良现象，从一个侧面反映了中国在治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的新风貌。
    有些客商对目前我国外贸经营口岸太多，公司太多太乱也提出了意见，望在整治外贸中撤掉一批公司。有位外商说：“首次来中国，超过了想象中的印象。希望中国能更多地给我们以认识中国、了解中国、同中国交流的机会。”他表示，有生之年，每届广交会他都要来参加。
