The people of Shuangshao Village have smiled.

Illiterate for generations, poor for generations

Shuangshao Village is located about ten kilometers west of Anyang City, Henan Province. For many years, the poverty of life and the low level of cultural education have made this small, relatively unknown village somewhat famous. The elderly still remember that before liberation, a mute holding a note asking for directions to Shuangshao Village found that no one in the entire village, young or old, could recognize the name.

After liberation, the village established a school, with five grades crammed into one classroom, taking turns to attend classes. For 30 years, the entire village did not produce a single high school graduate; the few junior high school graduates could not even calculate the sum of two halves when they were about to graduate.

The backwardness of education resulted in a village full of illiterates. Even a few village cadres could not recognize a single character. Thus, the entire village was stuck on the land, plowing fields, repairing shoes, and driving carts. They worked hard all year round but still had to rely on state relief grain. Until 1977, the per capita annual income of Shuangshao Village was less than 200 yuan.

Establishing schools to eradicate poverty

"I just don't believe that Shuangshao Village's poverty can't be changed!" In early 1978, after being sidelined for 10 years, the female party secretary Wang Fuhong was elected by the villagers as the village head. Her first action was to convene a meeting of all villagers, young and old, to discuss how to establish a school. She said with deep feeling, "Our village has been buried by illiteracy for generations. From now on, we must not let our children follow in our footsteps, knowing only how to pick up dung and drive carts!" She led the way by donating 800 yuan, which she had saved over many years, as school-building funds. Village cadres Shan Guoshun, Shan Shengping, and Zhao Zonglien also generously contributed their savings. Their actions deeply moved the hearts of the villagers. Some villagers said, "To let the children go to school, selling our property is worth it." In just half a month, the entire village raised 135,000 yuan, initially improving the teaching conditions in Shuangshao Village.

In 1985, due to the good business performance of the village-run factories, someone suggested using part of the funds to improve the living conditions of the villagers. Wang Fuhong firmly opposed this and insisted on taking out 280,000 yuan from the funds. She chose a site of 6 mu in the southeast of the village to build a two-story teaching building with a construction area of 1,214.4 square meters, which could accommodate 500 students, and purchased a full set of teaching equipment. From then on, the Xinghua Junior Middle School established by Shuangshao Village appeared in a new guise before the people.

To hire good teachers, the four of them have worn out their shoes and racked their brains over the years. At 11 o'clock at night, hearing that Xu Shougu, a teacher from Anyang County No. 1 Middle School, was resting at home, Shan Guoshun and Shan Shengping rushed to Gaoxue Village, several dozen miles away, in the rain. Seeing the two of them looking like they had crawled out of a mud pit, Teacher Xu was deeply moved and came to Shuangshao Village School the next morning.

In the eyes of Wang Fuhong and the others, "teachers" are like the stars of the entire village, and they care for them in every way. The village built a teachers' apartment, equipped with bookshelves, desks, beds, and other living necessities. During the day, if teachers had any problems in their thoughts or difficulties in their lives, the part-time principal Zhao Zonglien kept a record in his heart. The previous year, English teacher Qin Jinping was often worried because his family was in another place. Zhao Zonglien, upon learning this, immediately sent people to move his family and arranged suitable jobs for his family members in the village-run factory.

Shuangshao Village has changed

Hard work has brought bountiful results. Currently, Xinghua Junior Middle School has 11 classes of primary and junior high school students totaling 400 students and 24 teachers. In recent years of unified examinations in Anyang City, the results of this school have always been at the forefront. Now, among the 70-plus students who have graduated from the two classes, in addition to the 40 who have been admitted to various vocational schools, key high schools, and vocational high schools, the rest have become the backbone and wealth creators of the village-run factories.

The development of education has driven economic prosperity. In 1988, the per capita annual income of the entire village reached 685 yuan. Seeing this joyful scene, the four elders who took the lead in establishing schools smiled, and the villagers smiled. They felt deeply, "Why didn't we think of running a good school before?"

    段邵村的人们笑了

      代代文盲代代穷
    段邵村位于河南安阳市城西约十公里处。多少年来，生活的贫困和文化水平的低下，使本来鲜为人知的小村庄反倒有了名。老年人都还记得：解放前，一个哑巴手持纸条在段邵村问路，纸条上写着“段邵村”，可全村男女老幼竟无一人认识的。
    解放后，村里也办了学校，五个年级挤在一个教室里，轮流听课。整整30年，全村没出过一个高中生；屈指可数的几个初中生，临近毕业还不知两个1／2相加的和是多少。
    教育的落后使村里尽是文盲。就是几个村干部，也是斗大的字识不了一升。就这样，全村人死守在土地上，刨地修脚赶大车，一年忙到头，还得吃国家的救济粮。直到1977年，段邵村人均年收入还不足200元。
      兴办学校挖穷根
      “我就不信，咱段邵村这个穷样子改变不了！”1978年初，靠边站了10年的女支书王富荣被村民们推举为村长。她做的第一件事，就是召集全村老少商讨如何创办学校。她深有感触地说：“咱村因为没文化，埋没了老少几辈人。从现在起，再也不能让咱的娃儿们一个个跟咱一样，只会拾粪赶大车了！”她带头把自己积攒多年的800元钱捐作建校资金。村干部段国顺、段升平、赵宗莲3人，也慷慨解囊，拿出了自己多年的积蓄。他们的行动深深打动了乡亲们的心。有的村民说：“为了孩子能念上书，卖了家产也值得。”仅仅半个月，全村共筹措资金13.5万元，初步改善了段邵村的教学条件。
    1985年，由于村办工厂经营效益好，有人提出从中拿出一部分款项用来改善村民的生活条件。王富荣坚决不同意，硬是从中提出28万元，在村东南择地6亩，建起了一座建筑面积1214.4平方米、可容纳500名学生的两层教学楼，并购买了全套教学用具。从此，段邵村创办的兴华初级中学以崭新的姿态出现在人们面前。
    为了给孩子们请到“好先生”，几年来，他们4人踏破铁鞋，费尽心机。夜里11点，听说安阳县一中徐守古老师离休在家休养，段国顺、段升平就冒雨赶到几十里外的高穴村。看到二人像从泥窝窝里钻出来的样子，徐老师深深地感动了，第二天一早就来到段邵村学校。
    在王富荣几人的眼里，“老师”就像全村人的夜明珠，各方面都给予关心和照顾。村里为老师盖了家属院，配制了书架、写字台、床等生活用品。平日老师们思想上有什么问题，生活上有哪些困难，兼职校长赵宗莲心里都有一本帐。前年，英语老师秦金萍因家在外地，常常牵挂，赵宗莲得知后便立即派人把他的家搬来，并为其家属在村办工厂安排了合适工作。
              段邵村变了
    辛勤的汗水换来的是丰硕的果实。目前，兴华初级中学已拥有小学、初中共11个班400名学生和24名教师。在近几年安阳市统考中，这个学校的成绩始终名列前茅。现在，已毕业的两届70余名学生中，除被各类中专、重点高中和职业高中录取的40人外，其余的已成为村办工厂的骨干力量和致富能手。
    教育的发展带动了经济的振兴。1988年，全村人均年收入达685元。看到这喜人景象，4个带头办学的老人笑了，村民们笑了。他们感慨万千：“以前为啥就没想到要办好学校呢？”
