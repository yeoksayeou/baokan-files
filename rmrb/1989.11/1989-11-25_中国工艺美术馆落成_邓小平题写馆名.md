China's National Art Museum of Crafts was completed today in Beijing. The six golden characters "China's National Art Museum of Crafts" written by Comrade Deng Xiaoping are embedded on the front of the museum.

The China's National Art Museum of Crafts is located at the northeast corner of the Fuxingmen Interchange on West Chang'an Avenue, in the center of Beijing. Its completion adds a new scenic spot to the ten-li-long Chang'an Avenue.

The spokesperson for the Ministry of Light Industry, Sun Xiangjian, introduced that the newly completed China's National Art Museum of Crafts has a main building of seven stories, making it the largest craft and tourist product shopping center in China at present.

The first and second floors of the museum's main entrance are craft art exhibition and sales halls, covering an area of approximately 5,400 square meters. The third and fourth floors are exhibition halls, covering an area of approximately 4,800 square meters. The fifth floor is a treasure hall, covering an area of approximately 1,800 square meters, displaying craft art treasures collected from all over the country, with more than 200 pieces. Among them are four recently completed and inspected jade treasures, which are highly praised by the domestic craft art community as "national treasures": Shanzi's "Daiyue's Wonders," Ti Liang's flower basket "Gathering of Flowers," Huaxun's "Gathering of Auspiciousness," and a large screen "Four Seas in Joy." The three newly displayed jade treasures are unprecedented in Chinese jade history in terms of their size, ingenious design, and exquisite craftsmanship, and are rare in the world.

The sixth floor is a seafood restaurant operated by a Sino-foreign joint venture, and the seventh floor is an office. It is reported that the China's National Art Museum of Crafts is equipped with central air conditioning, sound systems, self-generating electricity, and other specialized facilities, as well as telex and fax facilities. The China's National Art Museum of Crafts will officially open to the public on November 26th when the Fifth National Craft Art Exhibition opens.

    据新华社北京11月24日电　（记者杨理科）我国第一座多功能的现代化工艺美术馆今天在京落成。邓小平同志题写的“中国工艺美术馆”六个金色大字，镶嵌在美术馆的正面。
    中国工艺美术馆坐落在西长安街复兴门立交桥的东北角，处于北京市的中心位置。它的建成给十里长安街添一新景。
