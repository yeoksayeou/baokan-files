A South Korean airliner crashed during takeoff.

According to a broadcast by the Seoul Broadcasting Station, a Fokker F-28 passenger plane of the South Korean Airline crashed shortly after takeoff from the Kimpo Airport in Seoul on the morning of the 25th. More than twenty people were injured out of the fifty-two on board.

The plane took off from Kimpo Airport in Seoul at around 7:50 AM local time, bound for the coastal city of Gangneung on the east coast of South Korea. The aircraft lost its balance shortly after leaving the runway and crashed onto the grass beside it. The fire that started in the cockpit spread to other parts of the plane. Twenty minutes later, the airport's firefighters extinguished the blaze.

The South Korean Ministry of Transportation and the airline company conducted an initial investigation and concluded that the plane was likely overloaded and had an insufficient takeoff distance, which may have caused the accident.

　　南朝鲜一架客机起飞时坠毁
    据汉城广播电台报道，南朝鲜航空公司的一架F—28民航客机二十五日上午在汉城金浦机场起飞时坠毁，机上五十二人中有二十多人受伤。
    这架客机二十五日上午汉城时间七时五十分左右自金浦机场起飞，拟飞往南朝鲜东海岸城市江陵。飞机滑行后刚刚飞离跑道即失去重心，坠落在跑道边的草地上。驾驶室燃起的火向飞机其他部位蔓延，二十分钟后，机场消防队员将火扑灭。
    南朝鲜交通部和航空公司经初步调查后认为，飞机超载和滑行距离短可能是发生这次事故的原因。
