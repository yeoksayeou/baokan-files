The results of the widely watched Namibian Constitutional Assembly elections have been announced. The South West Africa People's Organization, led by Sam Nujoma, has secured 41 out of the 72 seats in the Constitutional Assembly. According to Namibian election law, the South West Africa People's Organization will work with other parties to draft the Namibian Constitution and form a new government. This is a significant victory for the Namibian people in their struggle to finally rid themselves of colonial rule and move towards national independence. A new chapter in Namibian history has begun. The Chinese people are delighted to extend their heartfelt congratulations to the Namibian people.

The victory of the Namibian people in the elections is the result of their long-term struggle. Namibia was originally a German colony and was later illegally annexed by South Africa. To end colonial rule and strive for national self-determination and independence, the Namibian people, under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization, have waged a relentless and courageous struggle. Whether facing brutal armed suppression or the false promise of "internal solutions," the Namibian people have never yielded. In recent years, to adapt to the changing situation, the South West Africa People's Organization, while continuing armed struggle, has further intensified political struggle, gradually expanding its influence, making the South African government's illegal occupation of Namibia increasingly unpopular. It is the unyielding will of the Namibian people in their struggle for independence and the active support of people around the world that have forced the South African authorities to accept United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 on Namibian independence, laying the foundation for this election. The South West Africa People's Organization, through its struggle, has united the broad masses, thus winning the broad support of the Namibian people in the elections and making a significant contribution to the struggle for national independence.

The Namibian people's struggle for independence has received widespread sympathy and strong support from the people of Africa and the world. The Organization of African Unity has always regarded the struggle of the Namibian people as an important part of its work, providing unwavering support. Many African countries, especially the frontline states, have made tremendous efforts to achieve Namibian independence. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 435, adopted on September 29, 1978, reflects the international community's concern and support for Namibian independence. To ensure that Namibia achieves independence through fair and free elections, the United Nations has sent a special representative to Namibia and organized a support team with 23 member countries to handle the affairs of Namibia's completion of independence. All of this shows that strong international support has played a positive role in promoting Namibian independence. Therefore, the victory of the Namibian people is also a victory for the African national liberation cause and for all justice-loving countries and peoples in the world.

As the last remaining colony on the African continent, Namibia's independence undoubtedly provides strong encouragement and support for the South African people in their struggle against racial discrimination and to dismantle the last bastion of racism in the world.

However, it should be noted that the road to final independence for the Namibian people is still bumpy. In the process of drafting the Constitution and forming a new government, the Namibian people will face many complex and difficult issues in state building, national unity, economic independence, and territorial integrity. Some die-hard elements will continue to create obstacles and cause disruption. Nevertheless, we believe that the Namibian people will be able to consolidate the achievements of their long struggle, strengthen national unity, overcome various obstacles, and actively and prudently solve the problems on the road ahead, to welcome the early arrival of the Namibian independence celebrations.

    走向独立的关键性一步
    本报评论员
    举世瞩目的纳米比亚制宪议会选举结果已经揭晓。由萨姆·努乔马领导的西南非洲人民组织获得了72个制宪议会议员席位中的41席。根据纳米比亚独立选举法，西南非洲人民组织将与其他政党一起负责起草纳米比亚独立宪法和组织新政府。这是纳米比亚人民最终摆脱殖民统治、走向国家独立进程中的重大胜利，纳米比亚历史从此揭开了新的篇章。中国人民满怀喜悦的心情向纳米比亚人民致以衷心的祝贺。
    纳米比亚人民在大选中的胜利是他们长期坚持斗争的结果。纳米比亚原为德国殖民地，后又被南非非法吞并。为结束殖民统治、争取民族自决和国家独立，纳米比亚人民在西南非洲人民组织领导下进行了前仆后继的英勇斗争。不论是残酷的武装镇压，还是虚伪的“内部解决”，都不能使纳米比亚人民屈服。近年来，为了适应形势发展的需要，西南非洲人民组织在进行武装斗争的同时，进一步开展政治斗争，日益扩大自己的影响，使南非政权非法侵占纳米比亚的作法越来越不得人心。正是纳米比亚人民争取独立的不屈意志和全世界人民的积极支持，促使南非当局接受联合国安理会通过的关于纳米比亚独立的435号决议，为这次大选奠定了基础。西南非洲人民组织通过斗争团结了广大群众，因而在大选中赢得了纳米比亚人民的广泛支持，为争取国家独立作出了重大贡献。
    纳米比亚人民争取独立的斗争得到了全非洲人民和全世界人民的广泛同情和有力支持。非洲统一组织一直把纳米比亚人民的斗争看作自己工作的重要组成部分，不遗余力地给以声援。广大非洲国家，特别是非洲前线国家，为实现纳米比亚独立作出了巨大努力。1978年9月29日联合国安理会通过的435号决议集中反映了国际社会对纳米比亚独立的关注和支持。为了确保纳米比亚能通过公正、自由的选举实现独立，联合国派遣了驻纳米比亚的特别代表，并组织了有23个成员国参加的援助团，负责处理纳米比亚完成独立的事务。这一切都表明，国际上强有力的支持，对纳米比亚独立起了积极的推动作用。因此，纳米比亚人民取得的胜利也是非洲民族解放事业的胜利和世界上所有主持正义的国家和人民的胜利。
    作为非洲大陆上最后一块殖民地，纳米比亚的独立对南非人民反对种族歧视、铲除世界上最后一个种族主义堡垒的斗争，无疑是有力的鼓舞和支持。
    但应该看到，纳米比亚人民最终实现独立的道路仍然是不平坦的。在起草独立宪法和组织新政府的过程中，纳米比亚人民将会在政权建设、民族团结、经济独立和领土完整等方面遇到不少复杂和困难的问题。少数顽固分子还会设置新的障碍，进行破坏和捣乱。然而，我们相信，纳米比亚人民一定能在巩固经过长期斗争取得的胜利成果的基础上，加强民族团结，排除各种阻碍，积极、稳妥地解决前进道路上的问题，以迎接纳米比亚独立庆典的早日到来。
