In recent years, the tourism industry in developing countries has developed rapidly. In some countries, tourism revenue has become a major source of foreign exchange earnings. Looking ahead to the next century, the tourism industry in developing countries will have an even broader development prospect.

The Americas is the second-largest tourism region after Europe, with over 70 million tourists in 1988 and tourism revenue of $39 billion. Many Latin American countries have long coastlines and beautiful scenery, making them attractive destinations for tourists. Mexico's tourism industry has also developed rapidly, with 5.4 million tourists in 1988 and tourism revenue of $2.3 billion, making it the country's second-largest foreign exchange earner after oil. Since Venezuela's oil income decreased in 1986, the country has begun to focus on economic diversification, and the tourism industry has developed as a result. In 1988, the number of tourists reached 720,000, a 40% increase from 1986, and tourism revenue reached $650 million, nearly doubling and accounting for 50% of the country's foreign exchange earnings. Asia's international tourism industry is second only to the Americas, with approximately 55 million tourists in 1988 and tourism revenue of about $34.5 billion, both showing significant growth compared to the previous year. Thailand's tourism industry is relatively well-developed, with high-quality services attracting a large number of tourists. In 1988, tourism revenue reached $2.4 billion, making it an important foreign exchange earner for the country. The Philippines, consisting of over 7,100 islands, has stunning scenery that attracts many tourists. In 1988, nearly 1 million tourists visited, and tourism revenue reached $1.4 billion. Africa's tourism industry is still in its infancy, with 12 million international tourists in 1986 and tourism revenue of only $2.4 billion. Egypt, with a relatively developed tourism industry, attracts tourists with its pyramids and other ancient sites. In 1988, nearly 2 million tourists visited, generating $2.2 billion in revenue. Seychelles, with its beautiful scenery, hosted over 70,000 tourists in 1988, earning $1 billion. In a country with a workforce of 20,000, 12% are employed in the tourism industry. Other countries are also leveraging desert landscapes, wildlife, and plants to vigorously develop their tourism industries. Looking ahead to the next century, Africa's tourism industry is poised for significant growth.

　　余洋
    近年来，发展中国家旅游业发展很快，在一些国家，旅游收入已成为外汇来源的主要支柱。展望下个世纪，发展中国家的旅游业将有更广阔的发展前景。
    美洲是仅次于欧洲的第二大旅游地区，一九八八年旅游人数有七千多万人，旅游收入三百九十亿美元。许多拉美国家有漫长的海岸线，风光明媚，是吸引游人的好地方。墨西哥旅游业发展也很快，一九八八年接待游人五百四十万，旅游收入二十三亿美元，成为本国仅次于石油的第二大创汇产业。委内瑞拉自一九八六年石油收入减少之后，开始注意经济发展多样化，旅游业随之发展起来。一九八八年游人七十二万，比一九八六年增长百分之四十多，旅游收入六点五亿美元，增长近一倍，已占国家外汇收入的百分之五十。亚洲的国际旅游业仅次于美洲，一九八八年旅游人数约五千五百万，旅游收入约三百四十五亿美元，比上年均有较大增长。泰国的旅游业搞得比较好，除热带风光外，高水平的服务质量，吸引了大批游客。一九八八年旅游收入达二十四亿美元，成为本国重要创汇部门。菲律宾由七千一百多个岛组成，奇秀风景成为游人向往的地方。一九八八年游人近一百万，旅游收入十四亿美元。非洲的旅游业尚处于起步阶段，一九八六年国际游客一千二百万人，旅游收入只有二十四亿多美元。旅游业较发达的埃及，利用本国金字塔等古迹吸引游人，一九八八年旅游者近二百万人，收入二十二亿美元。塞舌尔风光秀丽，一九八八年接待游人七万多人，收入一亿美元，全国劳力二万人中有百分之十二的人从事旅游业。其他一些国家利用沙漠风光、野生动植物等，也在大力发展旅游业。展望下个世纪，非洲的旅游业必将有一个较大的发展。
