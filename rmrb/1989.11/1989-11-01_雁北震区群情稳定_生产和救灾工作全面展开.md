The people of Datasong, Yanggao, Hunsuan, and Guangling counties in the Yanshan earthquake zone of Shanxi Province, with the support of the Party and the government and relevant departments, have decided to rebuild their homes with self-reliance and hard work. Currently, the mood in the severely affected areas is stable and orderly, and relief work is progressing steadily.

In Hunsuan County, the Party branch secretary of Chiniquan Village, Li Detian, organized the construction of more than 200 temporary shelters after the earthquake to solve the problem of winter housing for the people. In Yanggao County, 11 Party members and cadres in Dayukou Village implemented the responsibility system for production, and in just three days, they helped the people build 30 temporary shelters. The disaster-affected people in Houguiren Village in Yanggao County are clearing the rubble while carrying out basic farmland construction, mobilizing 10 tractors to plow more than 200 mu of land.

Datasong County is focusing on both relief work and the autumn harvest. The county committee has organized eight work teams to go deep into the grassroots level to specifically handle the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and basic farmland water conservancy construction. Currently, the autumn harvest in the entire county is nearly complete, and autumn plowing and basic farmland water conservancy construction have been fully launched. The entire county has mobilized 27 large and medium-sized tractors to plow 210,000 mu of land and level and prepare 12,000 mu of land.
