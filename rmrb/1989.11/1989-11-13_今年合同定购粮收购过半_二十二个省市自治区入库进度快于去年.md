This year's contracted procurement of grain has exceeded half of the target, with 22 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions having a faster intake rate than last year.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Beijing, reporter Chen Yun learned from the Ministry of Commerce that the intake of contracted procurement grain in China this year is progressing quickly. Out of 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, 22 have a faster intake rate than last year. By the end of October, the country had accumulated 34.026 million tons of contracted procurement grain, completing 68.1% of the contracted procurement plan, which is 3.516 million tons more than the same period last year.

It is reported that the main reasons for the faster intake are as follows: First, various levels of government have attached great importance to grain procurement, treating it as an important task to stabilize the economy. Leading officials have personally organized the procurement process, with specific measures and clear responsibilities. Second, farmers, with a sense of national responsibility, have shown more enthusiasm in selling contracted procurement grain than in previous years. In Shandong, there have been scenes of farmers enthusiastically delivering grain to the state with drums and gongs. Third, the funds for the procurement of contracted grain have been basically secured. The completed procurement of summer grain and early-season rice has basically not encountered the issue of issuing "blank checks."

    今年合同定购粮收购过半
    二十二个省市自治区入库进度快于去年
    据新华社北京电  （记者陈芸）记者从商业部获悉，我国今年合同定购粮食的收购入库进度快，在30个省、市、自治区中，有22个收购入库进度快于去年。到10月底，全国已累计入库合同定购粮3402.6万吨，完成合同定购计划的68.1％，比去年同期多收了351.6万吨。
    据介绍，收购入库快的主要原因一是各级政府重视，把搞好粮食收购作为稳定经济的重要任务来抓，主要领导挂帅组织收购，措施具体，责任到人；二是农民以国家大局为重，交售合同定购粮的热情高于往年，山东出现了农民敲锣打鼓交售爱国粮的局面；三是合同定购粮的收购资金基本落实，已经完成的夏粮和早稻收购，基本没有出现打“白条”情况。
