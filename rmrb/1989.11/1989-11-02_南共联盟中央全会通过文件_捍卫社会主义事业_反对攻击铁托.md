Yugoslav News Agency, Belgrade, October 31st, reported by Yan Zheng: Today, the Yugoslav News Agency published a document adopted at the recent 28th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The document emphasizes that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia must resolutely and forcefully oppose all activities that attack Tito, and defend, inherit, and develop the socialist revolutionary cause of Yugoslavia.

The document points out that with the deepening of the social and political crisis in Yugoslavia, attempts to politically negate and erase Tito and his contributions and achievements have become increasingly rampant and open. Some nationalist anti-communists and representatives of other counter-revolutionary viewpoints are trying to create conditions for the restoration of a "civil society" and "national socialism," and on this basis, "transform" Yugoslavia, change its federal system, disrupt national relations and national stability, and negate the development goals of Yugoslav socialism.

The document stresses that to defend, inherit, and develop Tito's cause and the socialist revolution of Yugoslavia, members and organizations at all levels of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia must persuasively, timely, and resolutely oppose all activities that attack and negate Tito's contributions and achievements. They must promote and participate in all open discussions on important theoretical and practical issues regarding Tito's historical role and his cause, as well as the socialist revolution. They must also provide ideological and theoretical training for such discussions, and particularly distinguish such discussions from the negation of Tito's role and cause, which is recognized by the world, and from various attacks on Yugoslav socialism.

    南共联盟中央全会通过文件
    捍卫社会主义事业　反对攻击铁托
    本报贝尔格莱德10月31日电　记者严正报道：今天南通社公布了不久前召开的南共联盟28中全会上通过的一份文件，强调南共盟必须坚决有力地反对各种攻击铁托的活动，捍卫、继承和发展南斯拉夫的社会主义革命事业。
    文件指出，最近随着南社会政治危机的加深，那种在政治上否定和抹煞铁托及其作用、事业的尝试也越来越猖獗公开。一些民族主义的反共者和其它反革命观点的代表企图为恢复“市民社会”和“国家社会主义”的政治活动创造条件，并在此基础上“改造”南斯拉夫，改变其联邦制度，破坏民族关系和国家的稳定，否定南斯拉夫社会主义的发展目标。
    文件强调为了捍卫、继承和发展铁托的事业和南斯拉夫的社会主义革命，南共盟成员和各级组织、机构必须有说服力地及时地坚决地反对各种攻击和否定铁托作用及其事业的活动，要推动和参与所有关于铁托历史作用及其事业以及社会主义革命的理论与实践等重要问题的公开讨论，并为这种讨论进行思想和理论上的训练，特别要把这种讨论与否定被世界承认的铁托的作用和事业及对南社会主义革命的各种攻击明确地区分开来。
