HAIKOU, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- Hainan Agricultural Reclamation has utilized a World Bank loan to build a number of world-class rubber plantations and supporting infrastructure. A World Bank inspection team expert recently conducted an on-site inspection and commented, "Among the rubber plantations I have seen in various countries, the management level here is the highest."

According to the Hainan Provincial Agricultural Reclamation Bureau, so far, Hainan Agricultural Reclamation has utilized a total of 190 million yuan in World Bank loans. This has resulted in the planting and updating of 563,000 mu of low-yield rubber plantations, exceeding the original plan by 10.7%. Additionally, a number of supporting projects have been established, such as the creation of 150,000 mu of protective forests, the intercropping of 250,000 mu of economic crops, the establishment of 10 wood processing plants, and the introduction of a number of advanced production technologies and equipment.

Hainan Agricultural Reclamation is the largest natural rubber production base in China, with 93 state-owned farms. In 1984, the World Bank provided a $100 million loan for the "China Rubber Project" to Guangdong Agricultural Reclamation, of which 85% was allocated to the Hainan Reclamation Area. After receiving this loan, Hainan Agricultural Reclamation implemented the project in 51 farms. Utilizing more than 30 years of China's rubber planting experience and advanced foreign technology, comprehensive plans and management measures were formulated in areas such as land planning, rubber plantation design, seedling cultivation, and technical training. This ensured that the newly developed rubber plantations achieved the expected goals of high-quality seedlings, forest network, mountain encirclement, and coverage. It is understood that the survival rate of this batch of newly planted and updated rubber trees is over 98%, and the retention rate is 90.2%. A small amount of rubber trees have already begun to be tapped for latex.

    海南农垦利用世界银行贷款  新植更新五十六万亩橡胶园
    本报海口11月11日电　新华社记者夏凯旋、本报记者罗自苏报道：海南农垦利用世界银行贷款建起了一批世界一流的橡胶园及其配套工程。世界银行检查团一位专家最近在这里实地考察后评价说：“我所看到的各国胶园中，这里的管理水平是最高的。”
    据海南省农垦总局介绍，
  到目前为止，海南农垦已利用
  世界银行贷款合计1.9亿元人
  民币，新植和更新低产胶园
  56.3万亩，超出原计划10.7％。同时还建立了一批配套工程，如营造起15万亩防护林，间作25万亩经济作物，办起10家木材综合加工厂，引进了一批先进生产技术设备等。
    海南农垦是我国天然橡胶的最大产地，下有93个国营农场。1984年世界银行为广东农垦提供“中国橡胶项目”贷款1亿美元，其中85％安排在原属下的海南垦区。海南农垦接受这批贷款后，将项目落实到51个农场，并运用我国30多年的植胶经验和国外先进技术，在土地规划、胶园设计、培育种苗、培训技术人员等方面制定了一整套实施目标和管理措施，使新开垦的胶园达到了良种化、林网化、环山化、覆盖化的预期目标。据了解，这批新植和更新的橡胶树成活率达98％以上，保存率为90.2％。去年已有少量胶树开始割胶。
