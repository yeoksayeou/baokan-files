The academic symposium on the "Living Fossil" of Chinese opera, the Mulan Opera, recently concluded in Huaihua City, Hunan Province. More than 170 scholars and experts from China, France, Japan, Canada, and other countries participated in this research activity.

The Mulan Opera has been active on the Chinese opera stage since the Northern Song Dynasty and is the most complete and grand religious sacrificial drama preserved in the world today, with unique academic research value.

The Mulan Opera is popular in the middle and upper reaches of the Yuan River, including the Huaihua area of Hunan Province, as well as parts of Guizhou and Sichuan Provinces. Moreover, there is still a group of elderly artists who can perform the complete repertoire of the Mulan Opera. During this conference, experts and scholars watched the performance of the old artists of Chenhe Opera, including "The Story of Mulan." This activity was supported by the International Cultural Promotion Foundation of UNESCO.
