Athletes from both sides of the Taiwan Strait achieved notable success on the fourth day of the Eighth Asian Athletics Championships. The Chinese team secured 4 gold medals, while Li Fu'en of the Chinese Taipei team won the first gold medal for his team in the decathlon.

The decathlon championship was a close contest between Li Fu'en and China's Gong Guohua. Li Fu'en had previously won the gold medal in the decathlon at the Fifth Asian Athletics Championships in 1983, while Gong Guohua was the champion of the Shanghai Championships. Both athletes were evenly matched. After the ninth event, Li Fu'en led Gong Guohua by just 4 points. In the final event, the 1500 meters, Li Fu'en demonstrated superior endurance, overtaking Gong Guohua to win the title of "Asian Ironman" with a score of 7703 points. Gong Guohua finished with 7649 points, securing the silver medal.

The three medals in the men's triple jump were also won by athletes from both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Chen Yanping of China won the gold medal with a jump of 16.95 meters, breaking the championship record. Another Chinese athlete, Du Benzhong, and Nai Huifang from Chinese Taipei took the second and third places, respectively.

Yu Zhicheng of China won the men's 110-meter hurdles with a time of 14.18 seconds, while Liu Huajin won the women's 100-meter hurdles with a time of 13.30 seconds.

Asia's record holder Yu Hourun dominated the women's discus throw, setting a new championship record with a throw of 61.92 meters.

The Chinese team has already won 17 gold medals. If they can fully demonstrate their capabilities in the remaining 9 finals tomorrow, they have the potential to surpass the total number of gold medals from the previous championship.

    第八届亚洲田径锦标赛
    海峡两岸选手捷报频传
    新华社新德里11月18日电　（记者黄平、谭仁侠）海峡两岸的中国选手在第八届亚洲田径锦标赛第四天的比赛中各有收获。中国队取得4枚金牌，十项全能选手李福恩为中国台北队夺得首块金牌。
    十项全能的冠军争夺战主要是在李福恩和中国选手龚国华之间进行。李福恩在1983年的第五届亚洲田径赛上曾获十项全能金牌，龚国华则是上海锦标赛冠军，两人实力相当。今天赛完第九项，李福恩仅比龚国华领先4分。在最后一项1500米跑比赛中，李福恩显示了良好的体力，压倒了龚国华，最后以7703分荣获亚洲“铁人”的桂冠。龚国华以7649分获得银牌。
    男子三级跳远的3枚奖牌也由海峡两岸的选手分享，中国的陈燕平以16米95摘走金牌，并打破了锦标赛纪录。另一位中国选手都本忠和中国台北的乃惠芳分列第二、第三名。
    中国选手余志诚以14秒18获男子110米栏冠军；刘华金则在女子100米栏中取胜，成绩是13秒30。
    亚洲纪录保持者于厚润在女子铁饼比赛中优势明显，以61米92打破了锦标赛纪录。
    中国队目前已获17枚金牌，如能在明天最后9项决赛中充分发挥水平，金牌总数可望超过上届。
