In the past, some work was often done in bursts, like a sudden gust of wind that shakes the mountains and earth, but then abruptly stops. Many bad things and bad habits often resurface soon after the "wind" has passed.

Regarding the punishment of corruption and the promotion of clean governance, the people are both happy and worried. They are happy because these actions align with public opinion, help improve party discipline, and contribute to the long-term stability of the country. They are worried that it might just be a passing fad, half-hearted, and not thorough enough. This is because in our past work, there has indeed been a tendency to "sweep in waves." Some lawbreakers have learned our patterns, becoming more cunning after experiencing these waves. Some have even become experts at "avoiding the wind" and opportunists who change with the times, repeatedly escaping danger. I have personally witnessed three scenes: First, a certain bureau chief, while seeing off an inspection team, regretfully spread his hands and said, "Please forgive us, we are currently in the midst of a campaign, so the reception is inconvenient, sorry, sorry!" Second, two leaders in a certain office were whispering to each other. One said, "I think this movement is quite fierce, brother, you should avoid the wind for a while." The other replied, "Brother, you're right, it's time to avoid the wind." Third, a certain factory's section chief asked the factory director, "Director, the gifts to be sent to the province are ready, when should we depart?" The director said, "Wait until this wave passes."

Relying on a single wave is not enough to eliminate certain corrupt practices in our lives. Those who think that issuing a few calls, organizing a few study sessions, formulating a few clean governance measures, and handling a few people, while highlighting a few typical cases in the newspapers, will solve the problem, are only harboring naive good wishes. It is reassuring that after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, from the central to the local levels, genuine efforts are being made. The Party Central Committee has taken the lead in practicing clean governance and has adopted many decisive and effective measures, both legally and institutionally. A "clean governance" atmosphere has initially formed across the country. This shows that clean governance will no longer stop, and corrupt and criminal elements will have no place to hide.

### 廉政建设不能刮风

    廉政建设不能刮风
    王平
    过去，有些工作常常是一阵风，风来了，山摇地动；风过了，戛然而止。有些坏事情和坏风气，往往在“风”过不久就死灰复燃。
    对惩治腐败，搞廉政建设，群众既喜且忧。喜的当然是这样做很符合民意，有利于党风好转，有利于国家的长治久安。忧的就是一阵风，半途而废，不能完全彻底。因为在我们以前的工作中确实存在着爱“刮风”的毛病，有些违法犯罪分子掌握了我们的规律，他们经历了风浪，变得更狡猾了。有的甚至成了“避风”的“专家”和见风使舵的“老手”，一次次地“化险为夷”。笔者就亲眼见过三个镜头：其一，某局长在送别一个验收检查团时，不无遗憾地摊开两手说：“各位请原谅，现在正在风头上，招待多有不便，抱歉，抱歉！”其二，某办公室两位领导在窃窃私语。甲：“我看这次运动来势凶猛，老兄还是先避避风吧。”乙：“老弟言之有理，是该避风。”其三，某厂一科长向厂长请示：“厂长，往省里送的礼品备好了，你看何时动身？”厂长：“等过了这阵风再说吧。”
    光靠刮一阵风，是刮不走我们生活中某些腐败现象的。谁要是以为发一两个号召，组织几次学习，制定几条廉政措施，处理那么几个人，抓几个典型登登报，就把问题解决了，这只能是天真的良好愿望。令人欣慰的是，这一次在党的十三届四中全会以后，从中央到地方，确确实实是动真格的了。党中央已经从自己做起，率先实行廉政，并且从法律上、制度上采取了不少坚决有力的措施。一个“廉政”的“大气候”已在全国初步形成了。这说明，廉政建设再也不会有停歇的时候，腐败分子、犯罪分子将无孔可钻。
