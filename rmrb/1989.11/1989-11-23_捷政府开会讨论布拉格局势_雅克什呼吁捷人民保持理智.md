Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 20th.

The federal government of Czechoslovakia and the governments of the two national republics held a joint meeting on November 20th, emphasizing that the government would, in accordance with its constitutional duties, resolutely defend the interests of the socialist society and the legal rights of citizens.

The meeting's communiqué stated that the government is concerned about the recent disorderly actions and attempts to undermine trust in the government's work and the socialist system. Such actions, it was noted, only benefit the opponents of reform and go against the true interests of the people.

The communiqué also pointed out, "The government advocates for a political resolution to the existing problems. However, solutions cannot be sought in the excited atmosphere and anti-socialist actions that have recently occurred in Prague." "The government opposes provocation and does not wish to take the path of conflict, but it cannot tolerate behavior that violates the country's constitution and laws."

The government also appealed to young students and artists to "understand the current complex situation and not fall into the illusion of solving complex problems with simple methods."

Since November 17th, demonstrations involving students and citizens have been taking place in Prague. On the afternoon of the 20th, more than 100,000 people gathered in Wenceslas Square in the city center for a rally and demonstration. According to the Czech News Agency, the demonstrators shouted slogans and carried banners demanding "political pluralism," "free elections," and "thorough reforms." Currently, the demonstrations have begun to spread to other cities in the country.

General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Gustáv Husák, delivered a televised speech on the evening of the 21st regarding the current domestic situation, urging citizens to maintain rationality and prudence.

Husák emphasized, "The socialist development path is the only prospect for Czechoslovakia." He pointed out that socialist development cannot be separated from reform, and the fundamental condition for the success of reform is a stable social atmosphere. Demonstrations and strikes will not improve the economic situation and social life.

He noted that only in the absence of any emotional excitement and prejudice can the current events and issues be correctly evaluated: the party and the highest state leadership are prepared to do so. Husák also pointed out, "The groups that planned the Prague demonstrations are attempting to manipulate some young people and artists to achieve the goal of 'destroying Czechoslovakia's socialist system.'"

The Executive Committee of the Czechoslovak Trade Union Central Council also issued a statement today, expressing concern and opposition to "actions that create chaos and attack socialism."

In the afternoon of the 21st, approximately 200,000 people gathered in Wenceslas Square in the center of Prague for a peaceful demonstration. According to the Czech News Agency, on the 21st, students in 12 major cities across the country went on strike and demonstrated.

　　捷政府开会讨论布拉格局势
　　雅克什呼吁捷人民保持理智
    新华社布拉格11月20日电　捷克斯洛伐克联邦政府和两个民族共和国政府20日举行的联席会议强调，政府将根据宪法赋予的义务，坚决捍卫社会主义社会的利益和公民的合法权利。
    会议公报说，政府对当前出现的破坏秩序、制造对政府工作和社会主义制度不信任的行动感到不安，认为这种作法只能有利于改革的反对者，而违背人民的真正利益。
    公报还指出，“政府主张政治解决现存问题。但是，不能在像近几天在布拉格出现的那种激动的气氛和反社会主义的行动中寻求解决办法”。“政府反对挑衅，不愿走冲突的道路，但不能容忍破坏本国宪法和法律的行为”。
    政府还呼吁青年学生和文艺工作者“理解当前的复杂局面，不要陷入用简单的方法解决复杂问题的幻想”。
    自本月17日以来，捷首都布拉格连续发生了有大中学生和市民参加的示威活动。20日下午在布拉格市中心的瓦茨拉夫广场，又有10多万人举行集会和示威。据捷通社报道，示威参加者呼喊口号和打着标语，要求实现“政治多元化”、“自由选举”和“彻底的改革”。目前，示威活动已开始向国内其他城市蔓延。
    新华社布拉格11月21日电　捷共中央总书记雅克什21日晚就当前国内局势发表电视讲话，呼吁公民们保持理智和审慎。
    雅克什强调，“社会主义发展道路是捷的唯一前景。”他指出，社会主义发展不能离开改革，而改革获得成功的基本条件是具备安定的社会气氛，示威游行和罢工不会改善经济状况和社会生活。
    他指出，在没有任何激动情绪和偏见的情况下才能正确评价当前的事件和提出的问题：党和国家最高领导机构准备这样做。雅克什还指出，“策划布拉格示威的那些集团，力图操纵部分青年和艺术家”，以达到“破坏捷的社会主义制度”的目的。
    捷工会中央理事会主席团今天也发表声明，对“制造混乱和攻击社会主义的行动表示不安和反对”。
    21日下午，在布拉格市中心的瓦茨拉夫广场上，约有20万人举行了和平示威。据捷通社报道，21日，全国有12个大中城市的大学生罢课和示威。
