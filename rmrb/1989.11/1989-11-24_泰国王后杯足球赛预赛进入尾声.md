The preliminary round of the 18th Thai Queen's Cup Football Tournament, currently underway in Bangkok, is nearing its conclusion. The Thai Dechangyu team has secured first place in Group B, while the Thai Klongchan Bank team has taken second place.

The Klongchan Bank team won their first match tonight, defeating the Thai Thai Bangkok Bank team 1-0, thereby securing their spot in the next round with four points. The second match was between the Dechangyu team and the Vietnamese team. The Dechangyu team, with one win and one draw, has three points, while the Vietnamese team, with one win and one loss, has two points, putting the Dechangyu team in a favorable position. In the first half, the Vietnamese team launched an attack, but due to the strong defense of the Dechangyu team, they were unable to score. The Dechangyu team, however, scored a goal in the 35th minute. In the second half, the Dechangyu team scored three more goals, ultimately winning the match 4-0.

So far, six teams from three groups have advanced to the next round. These teams are: the Thai Air Force team, the South Korean team, the Thai Chonburi team, the Thai Police team, the Dechangyu team, and the Klongchan Bank team. The Guangdong team from China will participate in the third preliminary match tomorrow night, facing the Thai Port Authority team. The Guangdong team has already secured two wins in two matches, accumulating four points.

　　泰国王后杯足球赛预赛进入尾声
    新华社曼谷十一月二十二日电（记者黄勇）正在这里进行的第十八届泰国王后杯足球赛预赛已近尾声，泰国德恒裕队获B组第一名，泰国盘谷银行队获第二名。
    盘谷银行队在今晚进行的第一场比赛中，以一比零胜泰国泰京银行队，以积四分的成绩首先进入复赛。第二场在德恒裕队和越南队间进行。德恒裕队已两战一胜一平积三分，越南队两战一胜一负积二分，形势对德恒裕有利。上半场一开始，越南队就发起攻势，但由于德恒裕队防守严，越南队未能破门。德恒裕队却在第三十五分钟时踢进一球。下半场，德恒裕队连进三球，全场以四比零获胜。
    到目前止，四个组已有三个组的六个队出线。它们是：泰国空军队、南朝鲜队、泰国叻巴差队、泰国警察队、德恒裕队和盘谷银行队。中国广东队明晚将参加预赛的第三场比赛，对手是泰国码头队。广东队已取得两战两胜积四分的成绩。
