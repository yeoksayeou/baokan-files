In the local elections held in early November 1989, Douglas Wilder was elected governor of Virginia, becoming the first African American governor in U.S. history to be elected by popular vote. David Dinkins was elected as the first African American mayor of New York City, the largest city in the United States. Additionally, in cities like Detroit, Cleveland, Seattle, and New Haven, African American candidates either retained their positions or were elected as mayors.

The victories of African American political activists in this local election have attracted widespread attention in the U.S. media. Some have claimed that African Americans have broken through the "color barrier" in politics. However, some political observers believe that these election results do not signify a genuine improvement in the political status of African Americans but rather reflect, from one angle, the serious racial issues in contemporary American society.

The struggle of African Americans in the 1960s against racial discrimination and for equal rights dealt a heavy blow to racism. The U.S. ruling class was forced to enact some legal provisions to abolish discrimination against blacks and proposed some measures to improve the socioeconomic status of African Americans.

However, in reality, the problem of discrimination against African Americans in political, economic, and social life remains far from resolved: more than one-third of African Americans still live below the poverty line today. They continue to face overt or covert discrimination in employment, education, housing, and other areas. Due to limitations in employment, housing, and transportation, many African Americans often reside in the central areas of large cities, while the white middle and upper classes move to the suburbs, creating a de facto racial segregation. In these cities, such as the capital Washington, as well as Chicago, Detroit, and Atlanta, it is often African Americans who serve as mayors. This is not only because African Americans constitute the majority of voters but also because white residents are willing to have African American officials manage African American residents.

The reason African American candidates were able to win in places like New York City and Virginia, where African Americans are in the minority, is that a significant number of white residents voted for African American candidates. However, this does not reflect harmonious racial relations but rather the fact that people are uneasy about the deteriorating racial relations.

According to reports in U.S. newspapers, violent conflicts between blacks and whites have frequently occurred in recent years. In 1988, 189 violent incidents related to racial tensions occurred in 35 states and Washington, D.C., doubling the number from the previous year. This summer, a black youth in New York City was shot without cause by a white person, leading to large-scale protests by blacks and violent clashes with the police. Shortly afterward, in Virginia Beach, Virginia, tens of thousands of black students, dissatisfied with the discrimination and exploitation by local white businessmen, engaged in large-scale riots. These racial conflict events have had a significant impact on voters' minds. Many whites believe that having African Americans address racial conflict issues might be more effective than having whites do so. An analysis in The New York Times stated that New York voters supported the relatively unknown Dinkins in the primary elections precisely because they saw his "potential to heal (racial wounds)."

Furthermore, the reason Wilder, Dinkins, and others were able to win is also related to their efforts to adopt a low-key stance on racial issues. In their campaigns, they all intentionally distanced themselves from the radical faction represented by black civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, and some even supported laws that were not in the interests of African Americans. These moderate stances undoubtedly made white voters feel more at ease.

African American political activists and voters, in order to fight for their own interests and improve their social status, actively participate in various election activities. However, the position of African Americans in the U.S. political arena remains insignificant. Currently, about 7,000 African Americans hold various elected public offices, a number that accounts for only 1.5% of all such public officials in the United States, while African Americans make up approximately 12% of the U.S. population. African Americans will have to travel a long and arduous road before they can truly control their own political destiny.

    美国黑人在地方选举中获胜说明什么
    新华社记者  黄泳
    在11月上旬举行的1989年美国地方选举中，道格拉斯·怀尔德当选弗吉尼亚州州长，成为美国历史上第一位由选举产生的黑人州长，戴维·丁金斯当选为美国最大城市纽约市历史上第一位黑人市长。另外，在底特律、克利夫兰、西雅图、纽黑文等一些大中城市，黑人候选人也分别蝉联或当选为市长。
    黑人政治活动家在这次地方选举中取得的胜利，在美国引起了舆论界的广泛注意。有人就此声称，黑人已突破了政治“色障”。但是一些政治观察家认为，这些选举结果并不意味着美国黑人政治地位的真正改善，而恰恰是从一个侧面反映了当前美国社会中严重的种族问题。
    美国黑人在60年代所进行的反对种族歧视、争取平等权利的轰轰烈烈的斗争，沉重打击了种族主义。美国统治集团被迫通过了一些法律条文，废除了对黑人的歧视，并提出了一些改善黑人社会经济地位的措施。
    但事实上，黑人在美国政治、经济、社会生活中受歧视的问题远未解决：三分之一以上的黑人今天仍然生活在贫困线以下，他们在就业、求学、住房等问题上仍然遭受着有形或无形的歧视。由于就业、住房及交通条件的限制，不少黑人往往集居在大城市的中心，而白人中上层阶级则迁居城郊，形成了事实上的种族隔离。在这些城市中，如首都华盛顿以及芝加哥、底特律、亚特兰大等多是黑人当市长，这不仅是由于黑人居选民多数，而且白人也愿意让黑人官员来管理黑人居民。
    黑人候选人能够在黑人居民占少数的纽约市和弗吉尼亚州等地获胜，这是由于相当数量的白人居民投了黑人候选人的票。但这并不反映种族关系的和谐，而恰恰是因为人们对不断恶化的种族关系感到不安。
    据美国报刊报道，近年来黑人和白人之间的暴力冲突频频发生。1988年，仅35个州和华盛顿市就发生因种族矛盾而引起的暴力事件189起，比前年增加一倍。今年夏天，纽约市的一位黑人少年无故遭白人枪杀，大批黑人因此上街示威，并和警察发生激烈冲突。时隔不久，弗吉尼亚州的弗吉尼亚海滩市因数万黑人学生不满当地白人商人的歧视和盘剥，而发生大规模骚乱。这些种族冲突事件对选民们的心理有较大的影响，不少白人认为，由黑人出面解决种族冲突问题，恐怕比白人更有效。《纽约时报》的一篇分析文章中写道，纽约选民在预选中拥戴名不见经传的丁金斯，正是看上了他“所具有的医治（种族创伤）的潜力”。
    此外，这次怀尔德、丁金斯等人之所以能当选，还同他们尽量在种族问题上采取低姿态有关。他们在竞选中，都有意同以黑人民权领袖杰克逊为代表的激进派拉开距离，有的甚至赞同不利于黑人利益的法律，这些温和的表现无疑使得白人选民感到放心。
    黑人政治活动家和黑人选民为争取自身的利益，改善自己的社会地位，积极参加各种竞选活动，但是黑人在美国政坛的地位仍然是微不足道的。目前，约有7000多位黑人担任各种由选举产生的公职，这个数目仅占美国这类公职人员的1.5％，而黑人约占全美人口的12％。美国黑人要想真正主宰自己的政治命运还必须走相当漫长的道路。
