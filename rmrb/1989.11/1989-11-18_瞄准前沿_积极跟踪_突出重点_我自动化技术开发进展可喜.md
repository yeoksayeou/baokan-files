		Aiming at the Forefront, Actively Tracking, Emphasizing Key Points: Progress in China's Automation Technology Development

		Our reporter from Shenyang, November 17th: Our reporter learned from the strategic target report meeting on automation technology held yesterday that in the past two years, the implementation of China's automation technology strategic targets has made commendable progress. State Councilor and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian attended the meeting.

		According to the principle of "aiming at the forefront, actively tracking, and emphasizing key points," this plan is divided into two themes: automated manufacturing systems and intelligent robots. In the past two years, the automation field expert committee and the theme expert group, based on extensive investigations and studies both domestically and internationally, have organized experts to conduct demonstrations and have completed the formulation of the implementation plan. The implementation plan highlights the following features:

		— Combining with the production practice of factories and enterprises. The automated manufacturing system research center is combined with the Chengdu Aircraft Industry Corporation, studying automated manufacturing systems in production practice and guiding production practice in the research of automated manufacturing systems, which has played a mutually promoting role.

		— Combining with national laboratories. In line with China's actual situation, the intelligent robot theme focuses on the research and development of three types of products: precision assembly robots, cable-free underwater robots, and robots for use in harsh environments.

		— Organizing a multi-level research and development team. Currently, there are more than 2,000 scientific and technological personnel nationwide engaged in the research of automation technology, initially forming a certain scale.

    瞄准前沿　积极跟踪　突出重点
    我自动化技术开发进展可喜
    本报沈阳11月17日电　记者段心强报道：记者从昨天在此召开的自动化技术领域战略目标汇报会上了解到，两年来，我国自动化技术战略目标实施有可喜进展。国务委员、国家科委主任宋健出席了会议。
    根据“瞄准前沿，积极跟踪，突出重点”的原则，这项计划分自动化制造系统和智能机器人两个主题。两年来，自动化领域专家委员会和主题专家组在国内外广泛调查研究的基础上，组织专家进行了论证，已完成实施计划的制订。实施计划突出了以下特点：
    ——与工厂、企业的生产实践相结合。自动化制造系统研究中心与成都飞机工业公司相结合，在生产实践中研究自动化制造系统，在自动化制造系统研究中指导生产实践，起到了相互促进的作用。
    ——与国家实验室相结合。联系我国实际，智能机器人主题研究开发精密装配机器人、无缆下机器人、在恶劣的环境中应用的机器人三类产品。
    ——组织一支多层次的研究与开发队伍。现在全国从事自动化技术领域研究的科技人员已有2000多人，初具规模。
