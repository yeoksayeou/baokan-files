Today, October 29th, marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of Comrade Li Dazhao. We pay our deep respect to this great figure of the Chinese revolution.

Comrade Li Dazhao is a great pioneer of the Chinese Communist movement, one of the principal founders of the Communist Party of China, and a world-renowned great Marxist and proletarian revolutionary.

Li Dazhao's life was a revolutionary life, a life of struggle, a life of glory, and a life dedicated to the liberation of the Chinese people. In spreading Marxism-Leninism, leading the May Fourth Movement, founding the Communist Party of China, leading the workers', peasants', and women's movements in the north, establishing a revolutionary united front and realizing the first cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, winning over the Northwest Army of Feng Yuxiang to join the revolution, and emphasizing military work, peasant armed forces, and cultivating revolutionary cadres, he made outstanding contributions and established immortal achievements.

When we review the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of the Chinese revolution, we cannot help but first think of our elder comrade Li Dazhao. However, after the national revolution's victory, due to various reasons, we did not do enough in studying, learning, and propagating Li Dazhao. His deeds were rarely mentioned, and there were few commemorative activities. After the overthrow of the "Gang of Four" and the rectification of wrongs, in 1979, the people of the capital held a commemoration of Li Dazhao's 90th birthday, Peking University erected a bronze statue for Li Dazhao, the Communist Party of China Central Committee built a martyrs' cemetery for Li Dazhao, and wrote an inscription for him in the name of the Central Committee. Deng Xiaoping and other central leaders inscribed words for the martyr Li Dazhao. The "Collected Works of Li Dazhao" was also officially published. Thus, people began to treat Li Dazhao with a historical and scientific attitude, evaluate Li Dazhao, study Li Dazhao, and learn from Li Dazhao. We must make the Chinese people and the people of the world know that within the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, there was from the beginning a great figure like Li Dazhao.

Li Dazhao lived in an era when the Qing Dynasty was in its final days, China had become a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country, and was the most backward, most reactionary, and most dark period. After the Xinhai Revolution, the power fell into the hands of Yuan Shikai, warlords divided the country, the nation was in chaos, and the people were suffering. He was deeply concerned for the country and the people, and spontaneously rose up to fight against the corrupt and reactionary Qing Dynasty and the feudal warlords. In the course of struggle, he learned Marxism and became China's first great Marxist.

Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The October Revolution sent us Marxism-Leninism." It was Li Dazhao who first accepted Marxism-Leninism and actively propagated Marxism. Li Dazhao firmly believed that Marxism could save China and rescue the Chinese people from their deep suffering.

Li Dazhao was China's earliest Marxist and communist. Under the direct influence of the October Revolution in Russia, he was the first to transform from a patriot to a communist. Through his vigorous promotion of the October Revolution and Marxism, he greatly awakened the new consciousness of the Chinese nation, thus opening a new era for the advanced elements of China to shift from learning from Western bourgeoisie to learning from the Soviet proletariat. His important essays such as "A Comparative View of the French and Russian Revolutions," "The Victory of the Common People," "The Victory of Bolshevism," "A New Era," "On Problems and Isms," and "My View on Marxism" are proof of this historical transformation. Li Dazhao was the person with the highest level of Marxism at that time and a most outstanding representative of modern revolutionary intellectuals in China.

Li Dazhao was the leader of the New Culture Movement in China and a principal leader of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal May Fourth Patriotic Movement. His early important articles not only first introduced Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese people, powerfully promoted the development of China's New Culture Movement and the outbreak of the May Fourth Movement, but also under the banner of science and democracy, led the broad masses of people and youth to launch the most courageous and profound attacks and criticisms against the feudal culture that shackled people's thoughts, making the Chinese people see the dawn of socialism. In 1920, he established the Marxist Research Society, led many progressive student organizations, and frequently discussed the Shandong issue. After the outbreak of the May Fourth Movement, he directly participated in various struggles and always correctly grasped and guided the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal mainstream of the May Fourth Movement, thus opening a new era for China's history to transition from old democracy to new democracy. Li Dazhao was an epoch-making hero in modern Chinese history and an outstanding leader of the Chinese revolution.

Li Dazhao was more importantly one of the principal founders of the Communist Party of China and an outstanding political activist in the early days of our party. Due to his promotion of the October Revolution and Marxism-Leninism, especially under his leadership, the deepening development of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal May Fourth Patriotic Movement, a large number of young people accepted Marxism under his influence and took the revolutionary road. In 1936, Mao Zedong told Snow that it was under the help and influence of Li Dazhao that he accepted Marxism. Mao Zedong also said that Li Dazhao was his teacher. At that time, even Chen Duxiu accepted Marxism under the influence of Li Dazhao. The May Fourth Movement prepared the ideological and organizational foundation for the establishment of the Communist Party of China. In the process of founding the Communist Party of China, Li Dazhao first established contact with the Comintern and exchanged views on the establishment of the Communist Party of China. Then, through Li Dazhao's introduction, the Comintern representative Voitinsky went to Shanghai to discuss the party-building issue with Chen Duxiu. In China, he was the first to call for party building. Even the name of our party was decided after Chen Duxiu consulted Li Dazhao.

Li Dazhao was the earliest leader of the Chinese workers' movement. Before the May Fourth Movement, he wrote a report on "The Life of Workers in Tangshan Coal Mines (Workers are not as good as donkeys)." During the May Fourth Movement, he loudly called for "practical movements for the unity of workers." In September 1920, under the leadership of Li Dazhao, the Beijing Communist Group was established, which first went deep into the masses. Then, the "Laborer" was published, promoting the combination of Marxism and the Chinese workers' movement. He also sent members of the Communist Group to use legal forms to carry out workers' movements on the six railways of Jingfu, Jingxu, Jinghan, Jinpu, Zhengding, and Longhai, and established a workers' labor supplementary school in Changxindian, becoming a new starting point for our party to engage in workers' movements. After the founding of the Communist Party of China, Li Dazhao led and initiated several strikes by workers in the north, including the shocking Kaiping Coal Mine Strike and the July 7th Railway Strike. These have left brilliant chapters in the history of the Chinese workers' movement.

Li Dazhao was also one of the earliest leaders in our party to pay attention to peasant issues and lead peasant movements. As early as February 1919, in his article "Youth and the Countryside," he advocated that intellectuals should go to the countryside. He proposed: "China is an agricultural country, and the majority of the laboring class are peasants. If they are not liberated, then the whole nation is not liberated; their suffering is the suffering of the whole nation; their ignorance is the ignorance of the whole nation; their life and death are the life and death of the whole nation." After the founding of the Communist Party of China, he not only sent party members to the countryside to develop party organizations and establish peasant associations but also personally guided the broad peasants in the suburbs of Beijing to carry out anti-tax resistance struggles. In 1925 and 1926, his "Land and Peasants" and "Red Spear Society in Lu, Yu, and Shan Provinces" became important documents for our party to guide peasant movements at that time. In 1926, when I studied at the Whampoa Military Academy and the Peasant Movement Training Institute in Guangdong, I studied Li Dazhao's "Land and Peasants," Peng Pai's report on the Haifeng Peasant Movement, and Mao Zedong's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society." These articles laid the theoretical foundation for the Chinese revolution and the struggle of peasants to seize land and power.

Li Dazhao was an important decision-maker and outstanding practitioner of our party's united front policy. He actively promoted the realization of the first cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang and was the most exemplary leader in carrying out the national revolutionary united front and implementing the united front policy. He was good at winning over excellent elements from the enemy camp to join the revolution. He had both knowledge and prestige, as well as high moral character, so people from all sides respected him, including some conservative figures, who admired his knowledge and character. In 1922, at the special meeting of the Communist Party of China Central Committee in West Lake to discuss the issue of cooperation with the Kuomintang, Li Dazhao played an important role. After the meeting, he was entrusted by the party to negotiate with Mr. Sun Yat-sen in Shanghai on the cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang and discussed the issue of revitalizing the Kuomintang to revitalize China. In early 1923, Li Dazhao also facilitated the talks between Sun Yat-sen and Joffe, promoting the development of cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang. At the party's third plenary session to discuss the issue of cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, Li Dazhao firmly advocated that Communist Party members should, on the one hand, join the Kuomintang to form and strengthen the national revolutionary united front and, on the other hand, maintain the independence of the Communist Party. In early 1924, he participated in the leadership work of the first national congress of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou, helping Mr. Sun Yat-sen successfully complete the reorganization of the Kuomintang and promoting the realization of cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang. Regarding Li Dazhao's important role in this conference, He Xiangqing spoke very profoundly. She said: "At the first national congress of the Kuomintang, 'Mr. Li Dazhao and I were both representatives. His amiable and sincere attitude, as well as his profound and great speeches, made people submit to him at first sight. He played a great theoretical role in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's reorganization of the Kuomintang, adopting the three major policies of allying with Russia, allying with the Communist Party, and supporting farmers and workers.'" After the Kuomintang National Congress, he served as a member of the Kuomintang Central Committee and the leader of the Northern Executive Department, continuing to work hard on the establishment and transformation of the Kuomintang's northern organization, and resolutely fought against the Kuomintang's right-wing in a confrontational manner. This has written extremely brilliant chapters in the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of the Chinese revolution.

Li Dazhao was one of the earliest leaders in our party to pay attention to military work. He was very successful in military work, on the one hand, paying great attention to expanding the influence of the revolutionary movement in the army, and on the other hand, clearly proposing that our party should pay attention to peasant armed forces and establish its own revolutionary army. Li Dazhao personally and through Xu Qian, Yu Youren, Qu Wu, and others did a lot of work on Feng Yuxiang, developing party organizations in Feng Yuxiang's National Revolutionary Army, and later playing an important role in Feng Yuxiang's general's oath to participate in the Northern Expedition. After Li Dazhao's death, the entire army of Feng Yuxiang's Northwest Army wore mourning, held a memorial service, and erected a monument in Tongguan to commemorate him. It can be seen that Li Dazhao's influence on him was great. In the autumn of 1925, when Li Dazhao sent me to the Whampoa Military Academy, he personally told me: "Our party needs to establish a revolutionary army, carry out the national revolution, overthrow the warlords, and overthrow imperialism. We urgently need people who understand military affairs." He emphasized: "Our party must seize the army, or it will not work!" He encouraged me to go to the Whampoa Military Academy to study military affairs. As far as I know, at that time, Comrade Li Dazhao also sent people to the Military Academy of Leningrad, the Central Military Political Academy in Wuhan, and the Northwest Army Officer School in Zhangjiakou, as well as the Zhongshan Military Political Academy in Xi'an to study military affairs, cultivating many excellent military talents for our party. In 1926, under the leadership of Li Dazhao, the North China Region planned to launch a revolution in Beijing to overthrow the government of Duan Qirui and establish a revolutionary democratic government. Through this initial attempt to seize power, Comrade Li Dazhao deeply understood the extreme importance of our party establishing its own revolutionary army. Therefore, he paid great attention to the development of the armed peasant self-defense movement in Lu, Yu, and Shan provinces, trying to explore a new path for the Chinese revolution. In the history of the Chinese revolution, the seeds he sowed in emphasizing military work, emphasizing peasant armed forces, and establishing a revolutionary army played an important role at that time and later.

Before his martyrdom, he once prophesied, "We have already cultivated many comrades. Hanging me will not hang communism. Our comrades are like the seeds of red flowers, scattered all over the country. I firmly believe that communism will surely achieve a brilliant victory in the world and in China." These seeds also sprouted, took root, bloomed, and bore fruit in his hometown of Hebei Province and Shaanxi Province. After the Kuomintang betrayed in 1927, the peasants of Jindong Yutian staged a large-scale uprising of ten thousand people, established the Jindong People's Revolutionary Army, and the Shaanxi Province staged the Wei-Hua Uprising. Later, the Gaoli Uprising and the Zhina Uprising occurred. In 1938, a large-scale anti-Japanese uprising of 200,000 people broke out in his hometown of Suixi, which was carried out under the leadership of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Communist Party of China Northern Bureau. We, who participated in leading the uprising one after another, were all influenced and educated by Li Dazhao's revolutionary thoughts. Therefore, reviewing Comrade Li Dazhao's important thoughts and practices, later practice proved to be correct, no matter how it is evaluated, it is a remarkable thing. How deep he thought and how far he saw!

Li Dazhao was the direct leader of the revolutionary movements in the vast northern regions. After the founding of the Communist Party of China, he represented the Central Committee to lead the work in the North China Region. At that time, the North China Region included the vast regions of Northwest China, North China, Northeast China, and Shandong and Henan. In leading the work of party building, workers' movements, peasants' movements, women's movements, military work, revolutionary united front work, and the struggles of various strata of the people in these regions, he established immortal merits. As far as I know, the establishment of party organizations in these regions was almost all directly or indirectly related to Comrade Li Dazhao. He particularly emphasized military struggles and peasant movements, sending a large number of comrades to the countryside to establish peasant associations and armed peasants, making the peasant movements in Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces develop rapidly and widely. The various magnificent anti-imperialist and anti-warlord struggles opened up by Comrade Li Dazhao in the entire North China played an important role in the process of the Chinese revolution and are of great significance in the history of the Chinese revolution. When we recall the course of the Chinese revolution, we often think of the several transfers of the center of the Chinese revolution. During the May Fourth Movement, the center of the Chinese revolution was in Beijing; during the Great Revolution and the Land Revolution, the center of the revolution was in the south. After the Long March of the Red Army reached Shaanxi, the center of the Chinese revolution shifted from the south to the north. With the north as the base, the victory of the whole country was achieved because the north had the revolutionary foundation laid by Li Dazhao, the party organization in the north, the peasant armed forces, and the people cultivated by the northern party. This is an even more remarkable great event, and its historical significance is great and far-reaching. After the Long March of the Red Army, the great base of the Chinese revolution was placed in Shaanxi. During the War of Resistance, the Eighth Route Army marched into North China and quickly expanded to hundreds of thousands of people, establishing several large anti-Japanese bases in North China, all because the Eighth Route Army joined forces with the northern party, thus having such a smooth development.

Li Dazhao deeply understood the importance of cultivating revolutionary cadres. "After the political line is determined, cadres decide everything." Before and after the founding of the Communist Party of China, he paid attention to uniting and cultivating a large number of intellectuals with communist ideas, such as Deng Zhongxia and Gao Junyu, laying the organizational foundation for the establishment of our party. In 1924, after he became the secretary of the North China Region, in addition to opening a party school in Beijing, he also organized and planned to send a large number of party members and revolutionary youth to various revolutionary cadre schools at home and abroad for study, cultivating a large number of revolutionary cadres for the party. In addition to military academies, he also sent hundreds of students to the Eastern Labor University and Sun Yat-sen University in the Soviet Union, and to the Peasant Movement Training Institute and Worker Training Class in Guangdong and Wuhan. This batch of graduates worked in the army and local areas and played an important role in various periods of the Chinese revolution.

Li Dazhao made great contributions to the formation of the theory of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution. In China, he first proposed the issue of combining Marxism with the reality of the Chinese revolution and the issue of combining it with the workers' and peasants' movements. Guided by Marxism, he was the first to deeply study and analyze the national conditions of China, conducted extensive exploration and research on the basic issues of the Chinese revolution, and put forward many profound insights and proposals. He was the first to propose and argue the issue of the leadership of the proletariat in the Chinese revolution, the issue of the combination of workers and peasants, and the issue of the peasant class being the main force of the Chinese revolution. He profoundly expounded the necessity and importance of uniting the bourgeois democratic forces represented by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, highly evaluated Mr. Sun Yat-sen's historical position and role in the Chinese revolution, and was the first to grasp military work, win over the Northwest Army, and propose the issue of the party paying attention to peasant armed forces and establishing its own revolutionary army, as well as his thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal thoughts, all of which became important theoretical foundations for the party's general line and general policy in the democratic revolution. Not only that, but he also pointed out, based on the semi-colonial and semi-feudal national conditions of China, through exploration and practice, that the Chinese revolution must first overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism and feudal warlords and then carry out socialist revolution. He put forward many unique insights on how China should carry out socialism, such as the existence of commodity exchange, the circulation of gold and silver currency, and competition under socialist conditions. In the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee on "Some Historical Issues Concerning the Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China," it is pointed out: "Mao Zedong Thought is the crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Communist Party of China. Many outstanding leaders of our party have made important contributions to its formation and development." I believe that the outstanding leaders mentioned in the resolution are first and foremost Comrade Li Dazhao. Because Comrade Li Dazhao's series of discussions on the nature, tasks, characteristics, objects, driving forces, leadership, prospects, steps, and major strategies of the Chinese revolution have indeed set a brilliant precedent for our party to combine Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and naturally became the outstanding leader who had the most influence on the formation of Mao Zedong Thought. As for his outstanding contributions in literature, history, economics, philosophy, culture, education, ethics, and morality, they are worth our continued in-depth exploration and research. He not only had profound achievements in these fields but also wrote a large number of works, many of which have pioneering points and occupy an extremely important position in modern Chinese political thought history. Today, we inherit and carry forward the precious spiritual heritage left by the pioneers, which has profound significance for the development of academia and the enrichment of socialist spiritual civilization with Chinese characteristics.

Li Dazhao was a famous leader of the international communist movement and a world-renowned great Marxist and proletarian revolutionary. At the beginning of this century, the communist movement that Li Dazhao opened in an Eastern country had long since gone beyond the borders of China and become an important part of the international communist movement. In his lifetime of revolutionary activities, Li Dazhao had exchanges with many communists from various countries. In 1924, he led the Chinese Communist Party delegation to Moscow to attend the Fifth Congress of the Comintern and had extensive contacts with the leaders of many countries' communist parties. He loved the homeland of the October Revolution very much. Now, some foreign students in China, such as those from the Soviet Union and Japan, when they study Eastern thought, first study the great revolutionary practice and brilliant thoughts of Comrade Li Dazhao. Li Dazhao cultivated a generation of elites for us, set up a model for generations, and left a very precious spiritual wealth. More and more scholars around the world are studying Li Dazhao, and some countries have held activities to commemorate Li Dazhao in the past and present, which shows his great, deep, and wide influence. As for his profound remarks on combining patriotism and internationalism, they are the ideological weapons that inspire and encourage the Chinese people and the oppressed people of the world to unite and fight.

In the history of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, Comrade Li Dazhao's historical merits are outstanding, and his historical position and role are very important. Comrade Li Dazhao's contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution are not only reflected in his works but more in his revolutionary practice.

To study, learn, and propagate Comrade Li Dazhao, and carry forward Comrade Li Dazhao's great revolutionary spirit, has profound practical significance for us to study the history of the Communist Party of China, the history of the Chinese revolution, Chinese revolutionary theory, and the formation of Mao Zedong Thought, to study the development of modern Chinese political thought history, to study the relationship between the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and to inspire and urge us communists and the broad masses of Chinese youth to firmly hold the communist ideological belief and unremitting struggle spirit, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, adhere to reform and opening up, and build a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modernized country. However, due to historical reasons, young party members know little about Comrade Li Dazhao, and the masses know even less. Therefore, I hope that all party comrades and experts and scholars will introduce more about Comrade Li Dazhao, write more and better articles and works, and let the people of the whole country, especially the broad masses of young people, know that from the beginning, there was a revolutionary hero Li Dazhao in the Communist Party of China!

On the occasion of commemorating the 100th anniversary of Comrade Li Dazhao's birth, the People's Republic of China has been established for 40 years. Not only has the task of the national democratic revolution been completed, but the socialist system has also been established. At present, the people of the whole country are striving to carry out the modernization of the four aspects of socialism. However, the international reactionary forces are not dead in their hearts to destroy us and attempt to use the method of peaceful evolution to subvert our socialist system and turn China into a vassal of Western capitalism. They buy and support so-called "dissidents," "democracy fighters," imperialist running dogs, spread the political and economic models of Western capitalism, decadent thoughts, and lifestyles, and use every opportunity to create rumors, plot disturbances, and carry out subversive activities. The counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in Beijing this spring is a living example. Therefore, all party comrades and the people of the whole country must be soberly aware that we are building under the situation of the enemy's sabotage activities at home and abroad. We must be vigilant and be ready to smash the enemy's attacks and subversive sabotage activities at any time to defend the victory fruits that our country has obtained at the cost of the sacrifice of more than 20 million people over the past 100 years.

    中国革命的伟大先驱
    ——纪念李大钊诞辰一百周年
    李运昌
    今年10月29日，是李大钊同志诞辰100周年纪念日。我们怀着深深的敬意来纪念这位中国革命的伟人。
    李大钊同志是中国共产主义运动伟大的先驱，是中国共产党的主要创始人，是举世闻名的伟大的马克思主义者和无产阶级革命家。
    一
    李大钊同志的一生，是革命的一生，战斗的一生，光辉的一生，是为中国人民的解放事业英勇献身的一生。他在传播马克思列宁主义，领导五四运动，创建中国共产党，领导北方的工人运动、农民运动、妇女运动和广大地区的革命斗争，建立革命统一战线和实现第一次国共合作，争取冯玉祥部西北军参加革命，以及重视军事工作，农民武装和培养革命干部等方面，都作出了卓越的贡献，建立了不朽的功绩。
    我们回顾中国共产党的历史，回顾中国革命的历史，都不能不首先想起我们的老前辈李大钊同志。可是，全国革命胜利以后，由于种种原因，我们在研究、学习、宣传李大钊方面做得很不够。对于李大钊同志的事迹很少讲，也很少有纪念活动。粉碎“四人帮”，拨乱反正以后，1979年首都人民举行了纪念李大钊诞生90周年，北京大学为李大钊建立了铜像，中共中央为李大钊修建了烈士陵园，并用中央的名义给李大钊撰写了碑文，邓小平等中央领导为李大钊烈士题了词。《李大钊文集》也正式出版了。于是，人们重新用历史的科学的态度对待李大钊，评价李大钊，研究李大钊，学习李大钊。要使中国人民和世界人民都知道在伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党内，一开始就有李大钊这个伟大人物。
    二
    李大钊所处的时代，正是满清封建王朝末期，中国沦为半封建半殖民地，最落后、最反动、最黑暗的时代。辛亥革命后，政权落在袁世凯手里，军阀割据，国家四分五裂，国无宁日，民不聊生。他忧国忧民，愤世疾俗，自发地起来同腐朽反动的满清王朝斗，与封建军阀斗，他在斗争实践中学习了马克思主义并成为中国第一个伟大的马克思主义者。
    毛泽东同志说：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义”。正是李大钊最先接受了马克思列宁主义，并积极传播马克思主义。李大钊坚信马克思主义能够救中国，拯救中国人民于水深火热之中。
    李大钊同志是中国最早的马克思主义者和共产主义者。在俄国十月革命的直接影响下，他最早实现了从爱国主义者向共产主义者的转变，并且通过他对俄国十月革命和马克思主义的大力宣传，极大地唤醒了中华民族的新觉醒，从而开创了中国的先进分子由向西方资产阶级学习转到向苏联无产阶级学习的新纪元。他发表的《法俄革命之比较观》、《庶民的胜利》、《布尔什维主义的胜利》、《新纪元》、《再论问题与主义》、《我的马克思主义观》等许多重要论文，就是实现这一历史性转变的证明。李大钊同志是当时马克思主义水平最高的人，是中国近代革命知识分子的一位最杰出的代表。
    李大钊同志是中国新文化运动的旗手，是反帝反封建“五四”爱国运动的主要领导人。李大钊早期发表的许多重要文章，不仅最早地向中国人民传播了马克思列宁主义，有力地推动了我国新文化运动的发展和“五四”运动的爆发，而且在科学、民主两面大旗的号召下，率领广大人民和青年，向着束缚人民思想的封建文化进行了最勇猛、最深刻的冲击和批判，使中国人民看到社会主义的曙光。1920年，他创立马克思学说研究会，领导许多进步学生团体，经常讨论山东问题。“五四”运动爆发后，直接参加了各种斗争，始终正确地掌握和指导着“五四”运动反帝反封建的主流，从而开创了中国历史由旧民主主义向新民主主义转变的新纪元。李大钊同志是中国近代史上一位划时代的英雄人物，是中华革命的一位杰出的领袖。
    李大钊同志更重要的是中国共产党的主要创始人，是我们党早期杰出的政治活动家。由于他对俄国十月革命和马克思列宁主义的传播，特别是在他领导下的反帝反封建的“五四”爱国运动的深入发展，一大批青年在他的影响下接受了马克思主义，走上了革命的道路。毛泽东在1936年向斯诺说，他是受李大钊的帮助和影响才接受马克思主义的。毛泽东还说，李大钊是他的老师。那时，就连陈独秀都是受了李大钊的影响才接受马克思主义的。“五四”运动为建立中国共产党作了思想上和组织上的准备。在创立中国共产党的过程中，首先是大钊同志与第三国际建立了联系，并交换了建立中国共产党的意见。然后，经李大钊同志的介绍，第三国际的代表魏金斯基到上海和陈独秀酝酿建党问题。在中国，他是最早提出建党号召的人。就连我们党的名称，也是陈独秀征求李大钊意见后才定名的。
    李大钊同志是中国工人运动最早的领袖。“五四”运动前，他就写了《唐山煤矿的工人生活》（工人不如骡马）的报道。“五四”运动中，他大声疾呼要做“工人联合的实际运动”。1920年9月，在李大钊同志领导下成立的北京共产主义小组，首先就深入到群众中去。接着，创刊《劳动者》，促进了马克思主义与中国工人运动的结合。他还派共产主义小组的成员利用合法的形式到京奉、京绥、京汉、津浦、正定、陇海等6条铁路搞工人运动，在长辛店成立工人劳动补习学校，成为我们党从事工人运动的一个新起点。中国共产党成立以后，李大钊同志多次领导和发动北方工人的罢工。其中就有震惊中外的开滦煤矿大罢工和二七铁路大罢工。这在中国工人运动史上都留下了光辉的篇章。
    李大钊同志也是我们党内最早注意农民问题，重视农民运动的领导人。早在1919年2月，他在《青年与农村》一文中就提倡知识分子到民间去，到农村去。提出：“我们中国是一个农业国，大多数劳工阶级就是那些农民。他们若是不解放，就是我们国民全体不解放；他们的苦痛，就是我们国民全体的苦痛；他们的愚暗，就是我们国民全体的愚暗；他们生活的利病，就是我们政治全体的利病。”中国共产党成立以后，他不仅选派党员到农村发展党的组织，组织农民协会，而且亲自指导北京郊区广大农民开展抗捐抗税的斗争。1925年和1926年，他发表的《土地与农民》和《鲁豫陕等省的红枪会》，成为我们党当时指导农民运动的重要文献。1926年，我在广东黄埔军校和农民运动讲习所学习时，就学习了李大钊的《土地与农民》，彭湃的海陆丰农民运动报告和毛泽东的《中国社会各阶级的分析》，这些文章，为中国革命和农民夺取土地、政权的斗争奠定了理论基础。
    李大钊同志是我们党的统一战线政策的重要决策者和卓越实践者。他积极地推动了第一次国共合作的实现，在开展国民革命统一战线和执行统一战线政策方面，他是最模范的领导人。他善于从敌人营垒里争取优秀分子参加革命，他既有学问，又有声望，又有高尚道德，所以各方面的人都尊敬他，包括一些保守派的人物，都尊崇他的学问和人格。1922年，在中共中央西湖特别会议讨论同国民党联合的问题上，李大钊发挥了重要作用。会后，他受党的委托在上海与孙中山先生进行了国共合作的谈判，讨论了振兴国民党以振兴中国的问题。1923年初，李大钊又促成孙中山与越飞会谈，推动了国共合作的发展。在党的三大会议讨论国共合作问题时，李大钊坚决主张共产党员一方面要参加到国民党中去组成和壮大国民革命统一战线，一方面要保持共产党的独立性。1924年初，他在广州参加了国民党第一次全国代表大会的领导工作，帮助孙中山先生成功地完成了对国民党的改组，推动了国共合作的实现。关于李大钊在这次会议上所起的重大作用，何香凝讲得非常深刻。她说：在国民党一大上，“李大钊先生和我都是代表，他的和蔼与诚恳的态度，以及他的透彻而伟大的言论，一见便使人折服。他对孙中山先生改组国民党，采取联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策，发挥了伟大的理论。”国民党代表大会后，他担任了国民党中央委员和北方执行部的领导工作，继续着力于国民党北方组织的创建和改造工作，并坚决与国民党右派进行了针锋相对的斗争。这在中国共产党的历史上，在中国革命的历史上，都写下了极其光辉的篇章。
    李大钊同志是我们党内最早注意军事工作的一位重要领导人。他抓军事工作是很有成绩的，一方面非常注意在军队中扩大革命运动的影响，另一方面明确提出我们党要重视农民武装和建立自己的革命军队。李大钊同志亲自并通过徐谦、于佑仁、屈武等人对冯玉祥做过许多工作，在冯玉祥的国民军中发展了党的组织，以后又对冯玉祥将军五原誓师参加北伐起了重要作用。李大钊逝世后，冯玉祥的西北军全体官兵戴孝，开追悼会，并在潼关树碑纪念。可见，李大钊对他的影响是很大的。1925年秋，李大钊同志送我上黄埔军校时，亲自对我说：我们党要建立革命军队，进行国民革命，打倒军阀，打倒帝国主义，非常需要懂军事的人。他强调提出：“我们党要抓军队，没有军队不行啊！”他鼓励我上黄埔军校学军事。据我所知，那时大钊同志还派人到列宁格勒军事学院，中央军事政治学校武昌分校和在张家口的西北军干部学校以及西安的中山军事政治学校去学军事，为我们党培养了很多优秀的军事人才。1926年，以李大钊为首的北方区，计划以军事改变和群众运动相结合的方式，在北京发动一次以推翻段祺瑞政府，建立革命的民主政权为目的的首都革命。经过这次夺取政权的初步尝试，大钊同志深深懂得了我们党建立自己革命军队的极端重要性。于是他非常重视鲁豫陕等省武装农民自卫运动的发展，力图对中国革命的道路进行新的探索。在中国革命史上，他重视军事工作播下的种子，他重视农民武装和建立革命军队的思想，在当时和以后都发挥了重要的作用。
    他在牺牲前曾经预言，“我们已经培养了很多同志，绞死我，绞死不了共产主义。我们的同志像红花的种子，撒满祖国各地。我深信共产主义，在世界，在中国，必然要得到光辉的胜利。”这些种子也在他的家乡河北省，以及陕西省发了芽，生了根，开了花，结了果。1927年国民党叛变后，京东玉田农民就举行过万人大暴动，成立过京东人民革命军，陕西省举行过渭华暴动，此后发生过高蠡暴动，直南暴动。1938年又在他的家乡冀东，爆发了震惊中外的20万人抗日大暴动。这次暴动是在中共中央与中共北方局领导下进行的。我们这些先后参加领导暴动的人，都曾经受过李大钊革命思想的影响和熏陶。因此，回顾李大钊同志的这些重要思想和实践，后来实践证明是正确的，无论怎么评价，都是一件了不起的事情。他想得多深，看得多远啊！
    李大钊同志是北方广大地区革命运动的直接领导者。中国共产党成立以后，他代表党中央领导北方区的工作。当时的北方区包括西北、华北、东北和山东、河南等广大地区，他在领导这些地区的建党、工人运动、农民运动、妇女运动、兵运工作、革命统一战线工作以及各阶层人民群众的斗争中建立了不朽的功勋。据我所知，这些地区的党组织的建立，几乎都跟李大钊同志有直接的、间接的关系。他特别注重军事斗争和农民运动，选派大批同志深入农村建立农民协会和武装农民，使河北、内蒙古、山西、陕西等省的农民运动得到广泛、迅速的发展。李大钊同志在整个北方所开创的各种轰轰烈烈的反帝反军阀的斗争，在中国革命的进程中起了重要的作用，在中国革命史上也是具有重大意义的。当我们回想中国革命历程的时候，常常想起中国革命中心的几次转移。“五四”运动时期，中国革命中心在北京；大革命时期、土地革命时期，革命中心在南方；红军长征到达陕北后，中国革命中心由南方转移到北方。并以北方为基地取得全国胜利，这是因为北方有李大钊奠定的革命基础，有北方党的组织，有农民武装，有北方党培育下的人民群众。这更是一件了不起的大事，其历史意义是巨大而深远的。红军长征后，把中国革命大本营放在陕北，抗战时八路军出兵华北，迅速扩大几十万人，创建华北几大块抗日根据地，都是因为八路军与北方党会师，才有这样顺利发展局面。
    李大钊同志深深懂得培育革命干部的重要性，“政治路线确定之后，干部决定一切。”他在中国共产党建党前后，就注意团结培养大批具有共产主义思想的知识分子，如邓中夏、高君宇等，为我党的创建打下了组织基础。1924年他任北方区书记后，除在北京开办党校外，还有组织有计划的向国内外各种革命干部学校输送大批党团员和革命青年去学习，为党培养了大批革命干部，除军事院校外，还向苏联的东方劳动大学、中山大学，向广东和武汉的农民运动讲习所和工人训练班，送去了数以百计的学员，这批学员毕业后，在军队和地方上工作，在中国革命的各个时期都发挥了重要作用。
    李大钊同志对中国新民主主义革命理论的形成，贡献是很大的。在中国，他首先提出要把马克思主义与中国革命实际相结合的问题，与工农运动相结合的问题，并以马克思主义为指导，最早深入地研究分析了中国的国情，对中国革命的基本问题进行了广泛的探索和研究，提出过许多精辟的见解和主张，他最早提出和论证了无产阶级在中国革命中的领导权问题，工农结合问题，以及农民阶级是中国革命的主力军问题，他深刻地阐述了联合以孙中山先生代表的资产阶级民主派的必要性和重要性，高度地评价了孙中山先生在中国革命中的历史地位和作用，他最早抓了军事工作，争取西北军，并提出党要重视农民武装和建立自己的革命军队的问题，以及他彻底地反帝反封建的思想，都成为党在民主革命中的总路线总政策的重要理论基础。不仅如此，他还根据中国半殖民地半封建的国情，经过探索和实践，指出中国革命只有先推翻帝国主义、封建军阀的反动统治，然后才能进行社会主义革命的意见，他对中国如何进行社会主义的问题，提出了许多独到的见解，诸如，存在着物品交换，存在着金银纸币流行，存在着社会主义条件下的竞争等光辉论点。在党的十一届六中全会通过的《关于建国以来党的若干历史问题的诀议》中指出：“毛泽东思想是中国共产党集体智慧的结晶，我党许多卓越领导人对它的形成和发展都作出了重要的贡献。”我认为，决议指出的许多卓越领导人，首先是李大钊同志。因为李大钊同志关于中国革命性质、任务、特点、对象、动力、领导、前途、步骤和重大战略的一系列论述，的的确确为我们党开创了把马克思列宁主义与中国革命具体实践相结合的光辉先例，理所当然地成为对毛泽东思想的形成最有影响的第一位卓越领导人。至于他在文学、史学、经济学、哲学、文化教育、伦理道德等方面的卓越贡献，更有待我们继续进行深入的探索和研究。他在这些方面不仅有高深的造诣，而且写了大量的论著，不少论点具有开创性，在中国近代政治思想史上具有极其重要的地位。今天，我们继承和发扬先驱者留下的这份珍贵的精神遗产，对于学术的发展，对于充实具有中国特色的社会主义精神文明建设，都具有深远的意义。
    李大钊同志是国际共产主义运动的著名领袖，是举世闻名的伟大的马克思主义者和无产阶级革命家。本世纪初，李大钊同志在世界一个东方大国里所开创的共产主义运动，其影响早已越出了中国的国界，成为国际共产主义运动的一个重要组成部分。李大钊同志在一生的革命活动中，曾经同许多国家的共产党人有交往。1924年，他率领中共代表团去莫斯科出席了共产国际第五次代表大会，与许多国家的共产党领导人进行了广泛的接触。他非常热爱十月革命的故乡。现在，有些外国在中国的留学生，像苏联、日本等国家的留学生，一提研究东方思想，就先要研究李大钊同志的伟大革命实践与光辉思想，大钊为我们培养了一代精英，树立了世代楷模，留下了一笔十分保贵的精神财富。世界上越来越多的学者都在进行李大钊的研究，有的国家过去和现在都搞过纪念李大钊的活动，这正说明他的影响之大之深之广。至于他把爱国主义和国际主义结合起来的精辟言论，更是鼓舞和激励中国人民和世界被压迫人民团结战斗的思想武器。
    三
    在中国革命和世界革命史上，李大钊同志的历史功绩都是卓著的，他的历史地位和作用是非常重要的。李大钊同志对中国革命和世界革命的贡献，不仅仅表现在他的著作上，更多的表现在他的革命实践上。
    研究李大钊，学习李大钊，宣传李大钊，发扬李大钊的伟大革命精神，对于我们学习中国共产党史，学习中国革命史，中国革命理论和研究毛泽东思想的形成，研究中国近代政治思想史的发展，研究中国革命与世界革命的关系，激励和鞭策我们共产党人和我国广大青年坚定共产主义思想信念和不懈的奋斗精神，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，建设富强、民主、文明的社会主义现代化国家，都具有很深刻的现实意义。可是，由于历史的原因，关于李大钊的事情，青年党员知道得不多，群众知道的就更少。因此，我希望全党同志和专家学者们，多介绍一些李大钊的事情，写出更多更好的文章和著作，让全国人民特别是广大青少年都知道：中国共产党内一开始就有个革命伟人李大钊！
    在我们纪念李大钊同志百年诞辰之际，新中国已成立40周年了，不但完成了民族民主革命任务，而且建立了社会主义制度。目前全国人民正在全力以赴的进行社会主义四个现代化建设。但国际反动势力亡我之心不死，妄图用和平演变办法，颠覆我国社会主义制度，把中国变为西方资本主义的附庸。他们收买支持所谓“持不同政见者”，“民运斗士”，帝国主义走狗，传播西方资本主义的政治经济模式，腐朽思想，生活方式，利用一切机会制造谣言，策划动乱，进行颠覆活动。今春发生在北京的反革命暴乱，就是一个活生生的例子。因此，全党同志和全国人民必须清醒的认识我们是在国际国内敌对势力进行破坏活动的情况下搞建设的，必须提高警惕，随时准备粉碎敌人的进攻和颠覆破坏活动，以保卫我国一百多年来牺牲2000多万人才得来的胜利成果。
