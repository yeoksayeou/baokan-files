Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 29th.

Premier Li Peng met with the delegation from the Japanese International Trade Promotion Association in the Great Hall of the People this afternoon. The delegation, led by Chairman Sakurai Yoshio, is on an annual visit to China. Li Peng stated that China's policy of welcoming foreign economic figures to engage in various forms of cooperation in China remains unchanged. He hoped that Japanese individuals and groups committed to long-term Sino-Japanese friendship would adopt a long-term perspective and a proactive attitude to overcome current obstacles in bilateral relations and take bold steps to restore and develop friendly cooperation between the two countries.

This is the 18th time the Japanese International Trade Promotion Association has organized a delegation to visit China. In 1984, Premier Li Peng accepted the association's invitation to visit Japan and participate in the 30th-anniversary celebrations of the association. During the meeting, Li Peng fondly recalled his multiple encounters with Mr. Sakurai and other old Japanese friends, and highly praised the significant contributions made by the Japanese International Trade Promotion Association over the past 35 years to promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and bilateral economic and trade relations.

During the nearly two-hour meeting, Li Peng also provided detailed information about China's domestic political and economic situation to the guests, emphasizing the country's policies and guidelines for rectification and deepening reforms. He pointed out that practice has proven that China's reform and opening-up policy, implemented under the premise of upholding the socialist system, is correct. China will maintain the continuity and stability of these policies, continuously deepening and improving the reform and opening-up policy during the process of rectification.

Mr. Sakurai Yoshio and other Japanese guests expressed that China's political situation is becoming increasingly stable, and the unity of the new leadership has left a deep impression on them. They will continue to work for the development of economic cooperation between Japan and China.

Chairman Zheng Hongye of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade participated in the meeting.
