	China's representative, Yu Mengjia, today at the 44th session of the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, called on the international community to take practical and effective measures to maintain international peace and security.

	The First Committee today discussed international security issues. Yu Mengjia pointed out that although the international situation has improved to some extent, factors causing global instability and tension still exist. To maintain international peace and security, the international community must continue to make arduous efforts, especially in four areas.

	First, the process of disarmament must be accelerated, and the arms race must be halted. To ensure international peace and security, no country should seek military capabilities beyond defensive needs, especially the two superpowers, which must bear special responsibilities for disarmament.

	Second, regional conflicts must be resolved fairly and reasonably, and regional hotspots must be eliminated. China has always advocated for the peaceful resolution of international disputes and opposes the use of force or the threat of force. China has always opposed one country's armed invasion and military occupation of another, and does not approve of the stationing of troops or the establishment of military bases in foreign countries. China will continue to play a constructive role in resolving regional hotspot issues.

	Third, relations between countries must be handled properly in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. All countries, regardless of size, social system, or ideological differences, are equal; no country should impose its will on others or seek hegemony; each country should handle its internal affairs independently, and common international affairs should be handled through consultation among all countries; all international disputes should be resolved through peaceful means.

	Fourth, a new international economic order must be established. This is necessary for the economic health and common prosperity of all countries and for eliminating non-military threats to international peace and security. In international economic relations, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should also be followed. Solving a country's economic problems can only be done by the government and people of that country based on their own national conditions, adopting appropriate policies. Economic exchanges between countries should be based on equality and mutual benefit to promote friendly cooperation, rather than being used as a means of pressure or interference in internal affairs. Attempting to impose a specific economic system or development model on others, or interfering with the economic policies and development efforts of developing countries, is contrary to international norms.

	Yu Mengjia said that as a Third World country, China is willing to work with other countries to fulfill the obligations of the United Nations Charter and strive to strengthen the United Nations' role in maintaining international peace and security.

    我代表在联大一委会呼吁国际社会
　　采取有效措施维护国际安全
    本报联合国11月28日电　记者刘开宸报道：中国代表俞孟嘉今天在第44届联大第一委员会上发言，呼吁国际社会采取切实有效措施，以维护国际和平与安全。
    第一委员会今天审议了国际安全问题。俞孟嘉指出，现在国际形势虽有所改善，但造成世界动荡不安和紧张的因素依然存在。为了维护国际和平与安全，国际社会仍应作出艰巨的努力，特别是应在4个方面采取切实有效措施。
    第一、必须加速裁军进程，制止军备竞赛。为了保证国际和平与安全，各国均不应谋求超出防御需要的军备，特别是两个超级大国，必须切实承担起对裁军的特殊责任。
    第二、必须公正合理地解决地区冲突，消除地区热点。中国一向主张通过和平谈判解决国际争端，反对使用武力或以武力相威胁。中国一向反对一国对另一国进行武装侵略和军事占领，不赞成在外国驻扎军队和设立军事基地。中国将为解决地区热点问题继续发挥建设性作用。
    第三、必须按照联合国宪章和和平共处五项原则妥善处理国与国之间的关系。世界各国不论大小，也不论社会制度和意识形态的不同，都一律平等；任何国家都不把自己的意志强加于人，都不谋求霸权；各国的内部事务由各国自己处理，世界的共同事务由各国协商处理；一切国际争端都通过和平方式解决。
    第四、必须建立国际经济新秩序。这既是世界各国获得经济健康发展和共同繁荣的需要，也是为了消除对国际和平与安全的非军事性威胁。在国际经济关系中，同样应该遵循和平共处五项原则，因为解决一个国家的经济问题，只能由这个国家的政府和人民根据自己的国情采取适当的政策，国与国之间的经济交往应在平等互利的基础上促进各国的友好合作，而不应成为施加压力和干涉内政的手段。企图把某种特定的经济制度和发展模式强加于人，干涉发展中国家的经济政策和发展努力是违背国际关系准则的。
    俞孟嘉说，作为第三世界国家的中国愿与其他国家一道，履行联合国宪章的义务，为加强联合国在维护国际和平与安全方面的作用而努力。
