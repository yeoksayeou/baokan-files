	Tracking Counterfeit and Substandard Goods in the Market

	Short-Length Adhesive Tape: Refusing Supervision and Acting Arbitrarily

	Hunan People's Radio Station, Shen Xuejun; Hunan Television Station, Luo Xiaogan: During May and June this year, our province's Loudi Region Economic Commission received reports from the public that the 20-meter specification "Red Star" pressure-sensitive black adhesive tape produced by the Loudi Region's August 1st Rubber Factory was short in length. On June 24, the Regional Economic Commission organized personnel to conduct on-site sampling and inspection, and the results showed that the average length of the products was only 14.1 meters. According to the relevant documents issued by the State Bureau of Technical Supervision, the Loudi Region Standards Bureau determined that these products were counterfeit and substandard. On August 3, Hunan Television Station revealed this in the evening news. Instead of learning from the criticism and improving product quality, the factory director denied the authorities' classification of his counterfeit and substandard products. On August 8, he brought a group of people to Changsha City to hold a "press conference" to defend his counterfeit and substandard products.

	To be more cautious, we reported the situation truthfully to the State Bureau of Technical Supervision and the Hunan Province Standards Bureau. On August 16, the Policy and Law Department of the State Bureau of Technical Supervision replied: "The short-length issue mentioned in the letter has been repeatedly sampled and inspected, and it occurs in various specifications of similar products, indicating that it is an intentional act to defraud users for illegal profits. According to state regulations, it should be considered a production and sale of counterfeit and substandard goods." The Hunan Province Standards Bureau replied: "'Red Star' pressure-sensitive black adhesive tape is a prohibited counterfeit and substandard product." They also pointed out to the responsible persons of the Loudi Region Economic Commission and the August 1st Rubber Factory: "The August 1st Rubber Factory must be rectified by the competent authorities and can only continue production and sales after passing the inspection by the local standards authorities." On September 8, when we handed over the official replies from the State Bureau of Technical Supervision and the Provincial Standards Bureau to the factory director, he actually said that these two replies "might not be correct." On September 9, this factory held a "product ordering meeting" in Loudi City without passing the inspection by the standards authorities.

	Defective Pesticides: Mass Distribution and Harming Seedlings

	Shanxi Hanzhong Daily, Qian Liu; Chen Zhenhua: This summer, our province's Mian County experienced a serious incident where the use of defective mixed "pesticides" caused large areas of seedlings to die. According to statistics from five districts and 35 villages, including Gaochang, Baolian, and Wenchuan, 143 households of farmers suffered varying degrees of damage, covering an area of 185 mu, with most of them basically failing to harvest.

	On June 16 and 17, individual business households in Heying Township, Lianmeng Village, Mian County, using the name of "Heying Township Agricultural Technology Station," went to the Hanzhong City Agricultural Materials Company to purchase 4 tons of 1.5% Lufu powder. At that time, the company had only 55 bags of this original pesticide, totaling 1375 kilograms. To make up the number, the company sold 2625 kilograms of mixed pesticides, which were reported as defective in 1982 and contained different types of pesticides such as Dichloroprop, BHC, Diethatyl ether, and Linuron, to Zhu Pingcheng at 350 yuan per ton. Starting from June 18, Zhu sold this "pesticide" to farmers at a high price of 1000 yuan per ton in the Mian County Agricultural Market. By the afternoon of the 20th, the staff of the Mian County Plant Protection Station discovered that one of the woven bags of the "pesticide" sold by Zhu Pingcheng had the word "Dichloroprop" written on it, and the color was abnormal, so they ordered him to stop selling immediately. However, Zhu had already sold 1615 kilograms in three days.

	After using this "pesticide," large areas of green seedlings quickly turned yellow, and then the entire plant withered and died. In Xiba Village, Heying Township, Gaochang District, a farmer used this "pesticide," and 4.6 mu of seedlings died completely. A farmer in Baolian District learned that his seedling field was affected and immediately released water to "wash the field," resulting in the second damage to 7.8 mu of seedlings in three neighboring households. Farmers strongly demanded the serious investigation and punishment of the responsible parties for this incident and compensation for all losses.

	Adulterated Wood Ear Mushrooms: Passing Off as Genuine and Making Excessive Profits

	Liaoning Fushun Daily, Ji Chunhong: Since early 1987, Wang Baochu and Wang Baohong from Shifen Town, Wa Fang Village, Fushun County, Liaoning Province, have been involved in the production of adulterated wood ear mushrooms. They added chemical fertilizer and sugar to the wood ear mushrooms and then added industrial raw materials that are resistant to drying. The adulterated wood ear mushrooms not only had weight but also appeared dry. They sold the adulterated wood ear mushrooms as genuine products in the market, making huge profits. Until the beginning of this year, some villagers in this village also joined the wood ear mushroom adulteration activities. When the industrial and commercial personnel investigated this case, the party branch secretary of Wa Fang Village claimed to know nothing about it.

    市场伪劣商品追踪
    短尺胶布：拒绝监督　我行我素
    湖南人民广播电台申学军　湖南电视台罗小甘来信：今年5、6月间，我省娄底地区经委接到群众举报，反映这个地区八一橡胶厂生产的20米规格的“红星牌”压延绝缘黑胶布尺寸不足。地区经委6月24日组织专人到现场抽样检验，结果证明产品平均只有14.1米。根据国家技术监督局有关文件规定，娄底地区标准局认定这些产品为伪劣产品。8月3日，湖南电视台在晚间新闻中作了披露。这个厂的厂长不是从批评中吸取教训，整顿产品质量，而是否认执法机关对其伪劣产品的定性。8月8日，他带着一帮人到长沙市召开“新闻发布会”，为自己的伪劣产品辩护。
    为了更加慎重起见，我们将情况如实反映到国家技术监督局和湖南省标准局。国家技术监督局政策法规司8月16日复信说：“信中反映的短尺问题，经过反复抽样检验，且在多种规格的同类产品上都有发生，说明是一种以牟取非法利润为目的，故意欺骗用户的行为。按照国家有关规定，应属于生产经销伪劣商品行为。”湖南省标准局答复：“‘红星牌’绝缘黑胶布属于禁止经销的伪劣商品。”并且当面向娄底地区经委和八一橡胶厂的负责人指出：“八一橡胶厂必须由主管部门整顿，经当地标准机关验收合格以后，才能继续生产销售。”9月8日，当我们将国家技术监督局和省标准局的正式复函交橡胶厂厂长过目时，他竟然说这两份复函“也不一定是对的”。9月9日，这家工厂在没有经标准部门验收的情况下，又在娄底市召开“产品订货会”。
    报损农药：大量经销　祸及秧田
    陕西汉中日报社潜流　陈振华来信：今夏，我省勉县发生了一起因使用报损的混合“农药”而导致大面积秧苗枯死的严重事件。据对高潮、褒联、温泉等5个区、35个村统计，143户农民的秧苗不同程度受害，面积达185亩，其中绝大部分基本绝收。
    6月16日、17日，勉县何营乡联盟村个体工商户朱平生，假借“何营乡农技站”的名义到汉中市生产资料公司要求购买含量为1.5％的乐果粉4吨。当时，这家公司这种原装农药只有55袋共1375公斤。为了凑数，公司将1982年报损的现经化验含有敌草隆、六六六、除草醚、利隆元等不同用途的农药混合物2625公斤，以每吨350元卖给朱平生。朱从6月18日开始，在勉县农贸市场以每吨1000元的高价向农民出售。到20日下午，勉县植保站的同志发现朱平生所售“农药”的一个编织袋上写有“敌草隆”字样，而且颜色异常，便令其立即停止销售。可3天内朱已售出1615公斤。
    农民使用这种“农药”后，大片大片碧绿的秧苗很快出现枯黄，继而整株干枯、死亡。高潮区何营乡西坝村一户农民使用这种“农药”后，4.6亩秧苗全部死亡。褒联区一农户得知自己的秧田受害后，立即放水“洗田”，结果使相邻3家的7.8亩秧苗二次受害。农民强烈要求严肃查处这一事件的责任者，并赔偿一切损失。
    掺假木耳：冒充正品　牟获暴利
    辽宁抚顺日报社季春红来信：辽宁抚顺县石文镇瓦房村王宝初伙同王宝洪等人，从1987年初开始从事加工掺假木耳活动。他们在木耳掺化肥、食糖的基础上，再加上耐干的工业原料，加工后的掺假木耳既有重量又显得干燥。他们把掺假的木耳以正品投放到市场，从中获取巨额利润。直到今年初，这个村的一些村民也加入了木耳掺假活动。当工商人员调查此案时，瓦房村的党支部书记竟一问三不知。
