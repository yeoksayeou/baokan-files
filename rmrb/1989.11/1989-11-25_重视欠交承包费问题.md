According to our bank's investigation, after the commercial enterprises in our county implemented the leasing and management system, the issue of contractors failing to pay contract fees has become very serious. As of August this year, five contractors in the Commercial Bureau system have failed to pay a total of 727,000 yuan in contract fees. Among them, the Commercial Bureau's Trade Center, after being contracted, was divided into 17 smaller accounting units, with 9 of them failing to pay contract fees, amounting to 386,000 yuan. The smallest amount owed is 1,760 yuan, and the largest is over 140,000 yuan.

The reasons for failing to pay contract fees are generally threefold: First, the company has relaxed its management and supervision of the contractors' funds, allowing individuals to long-term withhold public funds without repayment; second, the contractors' management is poor, or funds are lost, or profits are minimal, or even losses are incurred, making it impossible to pay the contract fees; third, contractors deliberately withhold contract fees to accumulate more funds.

Contractors failing to pay contract fees is essentially embezzling state funds, affecting the overall economic benefits of the enterprise. It is hoped that relevant departments will pay attention to this issue.

### 重视欠交承包费问题

　　重视欠交承包费问题
    据我行调查，我县商业企业实行租赁经营后，承包人欠交承包费问题很严重。截至今年8月份，商业局系统5户承包人欠交承包费达72.7万余元。其中：商业局贸易中心承包后划成17个小核算单位，有9个欠交承包费，金额达38.6万余元，最少的欠1760元，最多的欠14万余元。
    欠交承包费，大致有三种原因：一是公司放松了对承包人资金的管理和监督，致使个人长期拖欠公款不还；二是承包人经营管理不善，或资金流失严重，或微利，甚至亏损，无能力交承包费；三是承包人为了集聚更多的资金，故意不上交承包费。
    承包人欠交承包费，实际是侵吞国家资金，影响到整个企业的经济效益，希望引起有关部门的重视。
