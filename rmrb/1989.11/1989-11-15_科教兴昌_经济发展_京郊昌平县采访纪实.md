“Science and Education for Prosperity.”

This slogan is known by all 400,000 people in Changping County. Slogans, documents, radio, and television—all of Changping County's media outlets have been promoting this slogan.

In 1988, the total industrial and agricultural output value reached 2.04 billion yuan, with per capita income of 1,232 yuan.

This article will answer the question of how Changping County will further develop. Science and technology turn stones into gold.

The Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee gave farmers a good policy for hard work and prosperity. The farmers of Changping County seized this opportunity and picked up the golden key of science and technology.

Zhang Xianchuan, a senior agronomist in Changping County who was little known for many years, became famous after 1980. He signed a technical service contract for pear tree management and cultivation with Baxian Village in the county. The first year he signed the contract, the second year, the pear production of the brigade doubled, from 320,000 jin to 640,000 jin. In the third year, it reached 940,000 jin. The pears from Baxian Village are large, sweet, fragrant, and delicious, and are used to entertain foreign guests, who exclaimed "OK" after tasting them.

The county's livestock and poultry breeding technology service company promoted the new technology of "early sexing of chicks," which alone increased the county's poultry industry's annual income by more than 500 million yuan.

In 1983, the county promoted 44 important scientific and technological achievements, including "ground cover for peanuts," increasing grain production by 71.8 million jin, fruit production by 3.8 million jin, peanut production by 3.7 million jin, and increasing the output value of livestock and poultry breeding by more than 130 million yuan.

Science and technology are highly valued.

Changping has seen a surge in scientific enthusiasm. Since the second half of 1979, county-owned industrial enterprises have begun enterprise reform and potential exploration. In just two or three years, 48 technical renovation and equipment, product updates have been carried out, and 59 new products have been launched. Among them, the new process of thermos production has been promoted to the Soviet Union, and a foothold has been established in the export-oriented economy. The county has cumulatively increased industrial output value by 964.3 million yuan.

Township and village enterprises are eager for talent, and more than 3,000 senior and intermediate talents have been introduced from outside the county. Various skilled people and "Sunday engineers" have come in droves.

The county committee and county government have seized the opportunity to boost the science and technology heat, successively formulated 20 preferential policies for horizontal cooperation, six regulations to attract scientific and technological talents, held press conferences and talent attraction talks.

The science and technology heat is on the rise. Currently, the county has more than 70 enterprises that have established research institutions and experimental bases, established nearly 200 various research associations and more than 60 scientific research production joint ventures. All 30 townships in the county have established science and technology committees. The scientific research team is growing stronger, the scientific research institutions are forming a network, and scientific research is closely integrated with production.

Based on this, the "Science and Education for Prosperity" strategic plan proposed the "One Three Five Project," that is, to select one high-tech development zone, three science and technology-intensive townships, and 50 science and technology key villages in the county as demonstration bases.

With this as a sign, Changping County, based on the implementation of the "Spark Plan" proposed by the State Science and Technology Commission in the previous few years, has developed science and technology to a deeper and broader level of production. A new idea to implement the "Prairie Fire Plan" proposed by the State Education Commission has also been introduced. The county leaders have shifted their focus from introducing talents to cultivating local talents.

Three-in-one education to cultivate talents.

It is undeniable that science and technology can turn stones into gold, and thousands of intermediate and senior scientific and technological talents can play a guiding role. However, to truly transform science and technology into real productive forces, it is necessary to strive to improve the cultural and scientific quality of the 140,000-strong labor force in the county.

The countryside needs to develop vocational and technical education. The following story may enlighten people:

Wang Wenyu, a farmer in the late 50s, is from Shangyuan Township's Xiayuan Village in Changping.

In 1984, when the contract responsibility system was implemented, Wang Wenyu also happily contracted 50 mu of peach orchards from the village, hoping to "make it big."

Who would have thought that after cultivating the land for half his life, he did not know how to take care of fruit trees, and the peaches were small and shriveled. After calculating the accounts in the fall, he had "lost from his grandmother's house to his uncle's house." In a fit of anger, he gave up the contract.

Just at this time, the graduates of the vocational high school class set up by the township came to promote agricultural and forestry practical technologies. The "scholars" gave Wang Wenyu a few tips, and the next year the peach orchard was lush with green leaves, red flowers, and fragrant fruits.

That year, Wang Wenyu earned 4,000 yuan;

The next year, Wang Wenyu earned 6,000 yuan;

The third year, Wang Wenyu earned nearly 10,000 yuan.

Wang Wenyu was completely convinced. He told everyone, "Without the guidance of the vocational school graduates, the peach trees would have been burned as firewood!" Hearing that the township was expanding the school to set up vocational classes, he quickly took out 500 yuan to donate, "Donate money to build a school and cultivate technicians."

At the same time, the graduates of the vegetable specialty class of Changping Rural Vocational School were "snapped up" by Nanhua Village, Chang'an Township, 190 graduates of the fruit tree class were "packaged" by Nankou Farm, and the graduates of the animal husbandry specialty became animal husbandry guidance personnel in the township. Duan Debin became the manager of Shangyuan Township Agricultural and Forestry Animal Husbandry Company.

Ten years of hard work! In just nine years, Changping County's secondary vocational and technical education has made significant progress:

- 2,000 vocational high school graduates have taken up positions throughout the county;
- The number of students in school can reach 3,000, with nearly 30 specialties corresponding to the three major industries;
- The ratio of junior high school graduates entering vocational high schools, secondary technical schools, and secondary vocational schools to those entering ordinary high schools has reached 2:1.

The children of farmers have become the main force in building a new Changping.

Developing vocational and technical education requires a good foundation of primary and secondary education.

On the south bank of the Jingmi Irrigation Canal that runs through Changping County, next to Dongxincheng Village in Shangyuan Township, there is a row of red-walled and red-tiled buildings hidden among the green trees.

This is a newly built cultural area covering 200 mu.

The focus of the cultural area is basic education for primary, secondary, and kindergarten schools, as well as vocational education and adult education schools.

The concept of cultural education has permeated the minds of farmers who were once called "illiterate." "In the past, we built tombs and temples, but now we build schools."

In recent years, the 30 townships in Changping have built schools, with a total investment of more than 300 million yuan, and new school buildings covering an area of more than 130,000 square meters. More than 70 primary and secondary schools in the county have been newly built, relocated, or renovated.

Changping County's adult education has also developed rapidly, establishing 46 adult cultural and technical training centers, with an annual enrollment of 15,000 people. The illiteracy rate in the county has dropped from 8.5% in 1980 to 2.4% in 1988.

The 140,000 labor force in Changping County has walked out of the valley of low cultural quality.

People have reason to believe that the slogan "Science and Education for Prosperity" will be realized sooner rather than later with the efforts of the people of Changping.

    “科教兴昌”经济发展
     ——京郊昌平县采访纪实
     冯长水
      “科教兴昌。”
    ——昌平县40万人，人人知道这个口号。
    标语、文件、广播、电视，昌平县的新闻媒介为此大造舆论。
    1988年，工农业总产值达到20.4亿元，人均收入1232元。
    本文将回答昌平县的进一步发展靠什么。科学技术　点石成金
    党的十一届三中全会，给了农民们一个勤劳致富的好政策。昌平农民正是靠着这个好政策，拿起了科学技术这把金钥匙。
    张显川——这个昌平县的高级农艺师多年鲜为人知，1980年后却声名大振。他同本县八仙庄村签订了梨树管理栽培技术服务合同。头年订合同，第二年，该大队梨的产量翻一番，从32万斤增加到64万斤，第三年竟达到94万斤。八仙庄的梨，个大、味醇、香甜、可口，用来招待外宾，外宾吃后连说“OK”。
    县畜牧饲养技术服务公司提供、推广“雌雄鸡早期鉴别”新技术，仅此一项，就使全县养鸡业年增加收入500多万元。
    1983年，全县推广了“花生地膜覆盖”等重要科技成果44项，使全县粮食增产7180万斤，果品增产380万斤，花生增产37万斤，畜牧饲养业增加产值1300多万元。
    科学技术　备受重视
    昌平兴起了科学热，县属工业企业自1979年下半年开始了企业改革挖潜，短短两三年，共进行技术改造和设备、产品更新项目48个，有59种新产品问世，其中保温瓶制作新工艺推广到苏联，在外向型经济中打出“地盘”。全县累计增加工业产值9643万多元。
    乡镇企业求贤若渴，从县外引进各类高中级人才已逾3000人。各种身怀绝技的能人、“星期日工程师”纷至沓来。
    县委、县政府不失时机地为科技热升温，先后制定了横向联合的20条优惠政策、吸引科技人才的6条规定，召开了新闻发布会和吸引人才洽谈会。
    科技热方兴未艾，目前全县已有70余家企业建立了科研机构和实验基地，成立了近200个各类研究会、60余个科研生产联合体，全县30个乡镇成立了科学技术委员会。科研队伍日益壮大，科研机构形成网络，科研与生产紧密结合。
    在此基础上，“科教兴昌”战略规划提出了“一三五工程”。即在本县选定一个高技术开发区、三个科技密集乡和50个科技重点村，作为示范基地。
    以此为标志，昌平县在前几年实施国家科委提出的“星火计划”的基础上，把科学技术向生产的深度和广度发展，一个实施国家教委“燎原计划”的新设想也已出台，县领导的目光从引进人才转移到培养本县乡土人才的方向上来。
    三教统筹　培育人才
    科技点石成金无可怀疑，千百名中高级科技人才可以起指导作用。但是，真正把科学技术转化为现实生产力，还必须努力提高全县14万劳动力大军的文化科学素质。
    农村需要发展职业技术教育。下面这个故事对人们会有所启迪：
    王文玉老汉快60岁了，是昌平上苑乡下苑村的农民。
    1984年搞承包那会儿，王老汉也乐颠颠地包下了村里50亩桃园，指望借此“发”起来。
    谁知种了大半辈子地，却不懂得侍弄果树，桃儿结得又瘪又小。秋后一算帐，“从姥姥家赔到舅舅家去了。”一气之下，不包了。
    恰在此时，乡里办的职业高中班的毕业生来推广农林实用技术。“秀才”们给王老汉“支”了几招儿，来年桃园里果然是叶绿、花红、果香。
    这一年，王老汉收入4000元；
    再一年，王老汉收入6000元；
    第三年，王老汉收入近万元。
    王文玉老汉彻底服了气。他逢人便讲“没有职业班学生指点，桃树早当柴烧了！”听说乡里扩建学堂办职业班，他赶紧掏出500元送去，“掏钱办学堂，培养技术员”。
    与此同期，昌平农村职业学校蔬菜专业班毕业生刘民被城关乡南郝庄村“抢”去，果林班毕业生190多人被南口农场“包”下，畜牧专业毕业生当上了乡畜牧指导员，段德斌成为上苑乡农林牧公司经理。
    十年磨一剑！短短九年，昌平县中等职业技术教育一枝红杏出墙：
    ——2000名职高毕业生走上全县各个岗位；
    ——在校生可达3000人，开设与三大产业相对应的近30个专业；
    ——初中毕业生升入职高、中专、中技与升入普通高中的人数比例已达2∶1。
    农家娃成为建设新昌平的主力。
    兴办学校　着眼未来
    发展职业技术教育需要有良好的中小学基础教育。
    在横贯昌平县的京密引水渠南岸，上苑乡东新城村旁，绿树掩映中有一排排红墙红瓦。
    这是一片新建的占地200亩的文化区。
    文化区的重点是中、小、幼基础教育，也包括了职业教育和成人教育学校。
    文化教育意识渗透到被旧时代称为“斗大的字不识半升”的农民脑海之中。“过去修坟修庙，如今兴建学校。”
    昌平30个乡镇近几年乡乡建学校，总投资达3000多万元，新建校舍面积13万多平方米。全县中小学有70余所得到新建、迁建或改建。
    昌平县的成人教育事业也有了较快发展，建立了46个成人文化技术培训中心，接受培训的每年达1.5万人。全县的文盲率从1980年的8.5％降低到1988年的2.4％。
    昌平县14万劳动大军走出了文化素质低的峡谷。
    人们有理由相信，“科教兴昌”的口号在昌平人的努力下，一定会早日实现。
