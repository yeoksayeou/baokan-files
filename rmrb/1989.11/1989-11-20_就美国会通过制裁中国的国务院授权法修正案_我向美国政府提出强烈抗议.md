	China strongly protests against the U.S. Congress passing an amendment to the State Department Authorization Act to sanction China.

	New China News Agency, Beijing, November 19 - Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu today summoned U.S. Ambassador to China James Lilley to express strong indignation and lodge a strong protest against the U.S. Congress passing an amendment to the State Department Authorization Act to sanction China.

	Liu Huaqiu pointed out that since the Chinese government, in accordance with the Constitution and laws of China, suppressed the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, the U.S. Congress has repeatedly passed resolutions on this matter, which is purely an internal affair of China, interfering in China's internal affairs and stirring up anti-China sentiment. Especially at a time when the facts about the suppression of the riot in China have been made clear to the world, the U.S. Congress has passed a resolution to sanction China based on false reports and rumors, seriously damaging Sino-U.S. relations and hurting the national feelings of the Chinese people. This fully exposes that some members of Congress still insist on the hegemonic stance that has been condemned by the world. Where does the U.S. Congress intend to lead Sino-U.S. relations by acting so recklessly?

	Liu Huaqiu emphasized that on the issue of safeguarding national sovereignty, independence, and dignity, China will never be ambiguous and has never yielded to external pressure. History has proven that no economic sanctions can crush the Chinese people; instead, such actions will only backfire on the United States, harming its own interests.

	Liu Huaqiu said that in international relations, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence are the basic norms, and are also the fundamental principles guiding Sino-U.S. relations as confirmed in various joint communiqués. Currently, Sino-U.S. relations are facing difficulties, entirely due to the U.S. side repeatedly violating the above principles. The Congress's passage of the resolution to sanction China is another escalation of actions to deteriorate bilateral relations. The U.S. government is obviously responsible for this. The U.S. government has repeatedly expressed its willingness to restore and improve Sino-U.S. relations, and we welcome this expression. But what is needed now is the U.S. government's concrete actions in this regard.

	He said, we hope that the U.S. government, from the perspective of safeguarding the overall interests of Sino-U.S. relations and the fundamental interests of the two peoples, will take effective measures to clearly oppose this resolution of the Congress. Otherwise, all serious consequences arising therefrom can only be borne by the U.S. government.

    就美国会通过制裁中国的国务院授权法修正案
    我向美国政府提出强烈抗议
    新华社北京11月19日电  中国外交部副部长刘华秋今天约见美国驻华大使李洁明，就美国国会通过了制裁中国的国务院授权法修正案，表示极大的愤慨并向美国政府提出强烈的抗议。
    刘华秋指出，自中国政府根据我国宪法和法律平息在北京发生的反革命暴乱后，美国国会一而再、再而三地就这一纯属中国内政的问题通过议案，插手中国内部事务，掀起反华浪潮。特别是在中国平息暴乱的事实真相已大白于天下的今天，美国国会竟依然根据不真实的报道和谣言通过对华制裁决议，严重损害了中美关系和伤害了中国人民的民族感情。这充分暴露了一些国会议员仍然坚持举世谴责的霸权主义立场。美国国会这样一意孤行，究竟要把中美关系引向何方？
    刘华秋强调，在涉及捍卫国家主权、独立和尊严问题上，中国决不含糊，从来没有屈服于外来的压力。历史已经证明，任何经济制裁也压不倒中国人民，相反，这种作法只能使美国自食恶果，损害其自身利益。
    刘华秋说，在国家关系中，互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利和和平共处，这是国际关系的基本准则，也是中美双方在历次公报中确认的指导两国关系的根本原则。目前中美关系面临困难，完全是因为美国方面一再违背上述原则引起的。国会通过的制裁中国的议案是进一步恶化两国关系行动的又一次升级。美国政府对此显然负有不可推卸的责任。美国政府一再表示，愿意恢复和改善中美关系，我们欢迎这一表示。但现在更需要的是美国政府在这一方面的实际行动。
    他说，我们希望美国政府能从维护中美关系和两国人民根本利益的大局出发，采取有效措施，明确反对国会的这个议案。否则，由此引起的一切严重后果，只能由美国政府承担。
