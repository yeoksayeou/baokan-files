According to what I know, the national-level outstanding entrepreneur selection activity has been held twice, with 40 factory directors and managers who are skilled in managing factories and have outstanding achievements being awarded the title of National Outstanding Entrepreneur. Last year, 50 female factory directors were selected as the first batch of National Outstanding Female Entrepreneurs. These outstanding individuals were selected from advanced factory directors and managers across various industries and can be said to represent China's entrepreneurial team and have a solid grassroots foundation.

The name, role, and status of entrepreneurs have truly been recognized and understood by society since the Party's work shifted to focusing on economic construction and implementing reform and opening up. In this sense, the country's 10 years of economic development is inseparable from the efforts of factory directors and managers. However, in recent months, some biased views have emerged in society, such as the belief that the reform of the enterprise leadership system has gone too far; that contract management has enriched entrepreneurs; that the central role and comprehensive responsibility of factory directors have diminished the role and status of the working class as masters of the enterprise. These views are affecting the normal work and business operations of factory directors and managers. Some of them have even suggested that they will not continue as factory directors when their term ends. Obviously, this is not beneficial to the country, the enterprise, or the employees.

Are there individuals with improper conduct in the ranks of factory directors and managers? Yes, but the proportion is extremely small and cannot be used as a basis for creating and spreading biased public opinion. This is similar to how one cannot deny that workers are the masters of the enterprise just because there are lawbreakers in the ranks of workers. In my industry, in the past four years, 61 factory directors have been awarded the national "May 1st Labor Medal," 35 factory directors and managers have been named outstanding entrepreneurs in the industry, and only one person has made mistakes. This fact shows that generalizing from specific cases and attributing the behavior of a few individuals to the majority is unfair to the majority and can only harm the enthusiasm of the majority.

The problems caused by certain uncoordinated and imperfect measures in the internal reform of enterprises should not be blamed on factory directors and managers. Just as the weakening of ideological and political work in enterprises is not the fault of the grassroots, it is not the fault of the team of factory directors, secretaries, and political workers. Therefore, for the majority of factory directors and managers, it is necessary to have the understanding and support of enterprise employees and all sectors of society.

At the same time, factory directors and managers themselves must also correctly handle these views. First, they must continuously improve their own qualities. Currently, the most urgent task is to lead the employees to overcome the difficulties facing the enterprise and create new achievements to dispel such views.

    为企业家说几句公道话
　　刘兴利
    据我所知，国家级优秀企业家评选活动已经搞过两届，有40名治厂有方、业绩卓著的厂长、经理获得全国优秀企业家称号。去年又有50名女厂长被评选为首届全国优秀女企业家。这批优秀人物，是从各行各业先进厂长、经理中选拔出来的，可以说是我国企业家队伍的代表，也是有群众基础的。
    企业家的名称、作用和地位，真正被社会承认和理解，是在党的工作真正转移到以经济建设为中心，实行改革开放之后。从这个意义上讲，国家10年经济发展与企业厂长、经理们努力工作是分不开的。可是，近几个月来社会上出现了一些偏颇的议论，如认为企业领导体制改革搞过了头；承包经营富了企业家；厂长中心地位、全面负责抹杀工人阶级的作用和主人翁地位等。这些议论影响着厂长、经理们的正常工作和经营活动。他们中有的人甚至提出任期届满，不再当厂长了。很显然，这对国家、对企业、对职工都是不利的。
    厂长、经理队伍中有没有行为不端的人呢？
    有，但比例是极小极小的，不能成为制造传播偏颇舆论的依据。这正像不能因为职工队伍中有违法者，而不承认工人是企业的主人是同等道理。我所在的行业近4年来有61名厂长获得国家“五一”劳动奖章，35名厂长经理被评为本行业的优秀企业家，只有一人犯了错误。这个事实说明，以偏概全，把极个别人的行为说成是普遍的，对大多数人来说就不公平，结果只能是损害大多数人的积极性。
    企业内部改革的某些措施不配套、不完善引发出的问题，责任不能落在厂长、经理身上。正像企业思想政治工作被削弱的责任不在基层，不是厂长、书记和政工干部队伍本身造成的一样。因此，对广大的厂长经理来说，需要企业职工和社会各界的理解和支持。
    同时，厂长经理本人，也要正确对待这些舆论，首先要不断提高自己的素质；当前最紧要的，是要用带领职工闯过企业面临的难关，创造新的业绩去消除这种舆论。
