The curtain rises: Amidst the clashing of swords and the clash of armor in the "Dance of the Qin King," the so-called enlightened ruler Li Longji is completely immersed in his achievements of revitalizing the dynasty.

The curtain falls: Amidst the thunderous drums of Fishing Village, the "romantic emperor" Li Sanlang, in a state of panic and difficulty, begins his journey to the treacherous roads of Sichuan, each step filled with sorrow.

Recently, the Sichuan Opera "Huaqing Pool" (scripted by Chen Mingxing, performed by the Mianyang Sichuan Opera Troupe) has been staged in Beijing.

"Huaqing Pool" tells the well-known love story of Li (Longji) and Yang (Yuhuan). Its uniqueness lies in the artistic conception that transcends the original dramatic prototype. The story of the emperor and concubine's love has been passed down in China for a long time, but once it touches politics, the conclusion can only be "a woman brings disaster to the country." The debate on the relationship between imperial love and politics has continued to this day. The brilliance of "Huaqing Pool" lies in circumventing this difficult issue, breaking away from the original model in terms of subject matter. In the play, the love between Li and Yang and the Anshi Rebellion are not so important, and the character of Yang Yuhuan is fundamentally re-examined. The structural center of the entire play is Emperor Tang and his dynasty. From Li Longji's likes and dislikes, the characters' relationships of closeness and distance, and the plot's joys and sorrows are derived. Yang Guifei's elegant demeanor and intoxicated state, An Lushan's tribute of treasures, Li Shizhi's plea for death, all revolve around an emperor, and the emperor's will determines the fate of each person, leaving only a simple, cold political relationship between people. Thus, Li Longji's transformation from a man of great talent and diligence to one who indulges in sensual pleasures and is stubbornly self-willed, unfolds the social landscape of the Tang Dynasty from prosperity to decline.

If the script's literary description is merely a framework, then the stage performance is the true essence of the play. It can even be said that the author's creative intent is basically realized through the song and dance. Yang Yuhuan's silent language of striking down a group of flowers with a jade flute expresses her inner jealousy and sorrow; the seductive dance of the barbarian woman undoubtedly reveals the ugly soul of An Lushan; including the brilliant scene of a hundred birds paying tribute to the phoenix in the Hall of Supreme Harmony and the cavalry formation filled with killing intent outside the city of Chang'an, all clearly reflect Li Longji's two completely different mental states before and after the Anshi Rebellion. Indeed, the intensified song and dance make the audience see only a rough outline of the characters' spiritual characteristics, and it may not be possible to deeply and minutely understand the complex relationships between the characters. However, the intensified song and dance gives today's audience a strong impression, a strong feeling, and satisfies their strong desire for entertainment and appreciation. I have always believed that Chinese opera art should have a certain ideological content, but it should not and cannot bear too much, because doing so will inevitably suppress and even stifle its aesthetic nature of "telling stories through song and dance."

The Sichuan Opera "Huaqing Pool" has been performed more than a hundred times in Chengdu and Mianyang, and is very popular among young people. However, there is controversy in the academic circle. Some people say it is good, while others feel that it is a bit "excessive" and "out of bounds" to mix in disco dancing, tight-fitting costumes, orchestral music, and electronic lasers. Here, I only want to say one thing: When opera is on the brink of crisis and falls into the abyss of death, whoever can produce a script with both ideological and artistic potential and attract the audience, should be acknowledged as having some talent. It is worth everyone's attention and research to summarize their experience.

    新歌妙舞《华清池》
    章诒和
    帷幕拉开：在《秦王破阵舞》的金戈铁马中，所谓盛世明君李隆基正以全身心陶醉于他的中兴业绩。
    大幕渐落：在渔阳鼙鼓的隆隆声中，“风流天子”李三郎，仓皇而艰难地踏上西蜀险途，一步一凄凉。
    最近在京演出的川剧《华清池》（陈明星编剧、四川省绵阳川剧团演出）。
    《华清池》写的是人所共知李（隆基），杨（玉环）爱情故事。它的独特之处则主要体现在艺术构思上对戏剧原型的超越。李杨戏在我国流传久远，但帝妃之情一旦碰击到政治，得出来的结论只能是“女人误国”。关于帝王爱情与政治关系的争论，一直延绵至今。《华清池》创作的高明在于绕开这个难题，从题材上就跳出了原有模式。在戏里，李杨爱情和安史之乱都不那么重要，也从根本上重新处理了杨玉环这个人物。全剧的结构中心是唐明皇和他的王朝，从李隆基的爱憎好恶，产生人物的亲疏远近和情节的悲欢离合。杨贵妃的丰姿醉态、安禄山的献宝朝贡，李适之的以死相谏，无不是为着一个皇帝，而皇帝意志又决定着每个人的命运，人与人之间也只剩下一种简单、冰冷的政治关系。这样，李隆基由雄才大略、励精图治走向耽于声色、刚愎自用的性格转折，就衍化出大唐由盛至衰的社会图景。
    如果说，剧本的文学描写仅仅是一付框架，那么舞台演出才是剧作的真正血肉。甚至可以说，作家的创作意图基本上是通过歌舞性来实现的。杨玉环以玉笛击落群花的无声语言，诉说出内心的妒意哀情；妖冶的胡女狂舞，无疑是对安禄山丑恶灵魂的表露；包括那金銮殿上百鸟朝凤式的灿烂场景和长安城外充满肃杀之气的骑兵队列，也分明映衬出安史之乱前后李隆基截然不同的两种心绪情态。诚然，歌舞的强化使观众对人物的精神特征只看到一个粗略的概貌，对人物之间的复杂关系或许也不可能认识得非常深刻细微。但是，强化的歌舞却给今天的观众以强烈的印象、强烈的感受，并满足他们强烈的娱悦欣赏要求。我一向认为，中国戏曲艺术应该具有一定的思想内蕴，但不应也不可能负担过多，因为那么做，势必会抑制乃至扼杀它“以歌舞演故事”的美学本性。
    歌舞川剧《华清池》在成都、绵阳上演已逾百场，青年人极为欢迎。理论界却有争议。有些人说它好，有些人觉得把霹雳舞、紧身衣、管弦乐、电子激光都掺和进来，有点“过分”、“出格”。这里，我只想说一句：当戏曲从危机的警界线跌入死亡谷的时候，有谁能搞出思想性艺术性都有苗头的剧本抓住观众，就得承认谁有点本事。就值得大家关注，去研究总结他们的经验。（附图片）
