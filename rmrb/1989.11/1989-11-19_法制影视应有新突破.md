With the rapid development of legal system construction in China in recent years, legal TV shows have also made significant progress. According to relevant statistics, from 1977 to 1986, the country produced a total of 83 legal films. In 1986, more than 1,500 TV dramas were produced nationwide, with 40% of them being legal-themed. Films such as "Juvenile Delinquents," "New Shore," and "Inside and Outside the Courtroom" began to break free from the constraints of "class struggle as the key," focusing on the conflicts between right and wrong, justice and evil, and striving to depict characters' mental states and social attitudes within these conflicts. However, they are still in a transitional period, showing obvious transitional and immature characteristics, reflecting the creators' confusion.

One of the confusions is the narrow range of topics. Currently, legal TV shows mainly focus on criminal law, while those involving civil law, economic law, administrative law, and China's judicial system are rare. Some creators and a significant portion of the audience seem to have formed a fixed mindset: legal TV shows equal murder and crime-solving. In reality, whether it's family relationships, romantic relationships, inheritance, child education, etc., all are related to the legal system and should be artistically portrayed. How to truthfully, deeply, and innovatively present the clashes of people's mentalities and the updating of concepts during China's legal system construction is a topic that legal TV shows should explore, with much potential.

Another confusion is the legal "deviations" in the story content. Art allows for fiction, but it must be based on real life and have legal grounds. Otherwise, it loses the basis of artistic truth. Some directors, due to their lack of legal knowledge, pursue the unusual and create suspense, resulting in some plot elements that cannot accurately reflect judicial practice. Even common-sense procedural details can be far from legal regulations, inviting ridicule from the public.

The third confusion is the tilt in aesthetic levels. While considering the entertainment value of legal TV shows, the aesthetic value must be emphasized. Some directors are keen on naturalistic depictions of criminal facts in TV shows, using "slow motion," "close-ups," and "freeze frames" to exaggerate. However, they rarely consider how to delve into the deep psychology of characters to show the conflicts between right and wrong, justice and evil, or how to reveal the social, historical, personal, moral, and psychological causes of crime to provide deep thought-provoking and soul-stirring enlightenment. Additionally, the presentation methods of a significant portion of current legal TV shows often fall into old formulas.

"Confusion" and "choice" often go hand in hand. The broad audience, film and TV industry, and legal scholars eagerly hope that legal TV shows will overcome these "confusions" and advance to a new level.

    法制影视应有新突破
    随着近年来我国法制建设的迅速发展，法制影视创作也取得了长足进步。据有关方面统计，1977年至1986年，全国共拍摄法制影片83部，1986年全国拍摄电视剧1500多部，其中法制题材占40％。《少年犯》、《新岸》、《法庭内外》等影视片，内容上开始摆脱“以阶级斗争为纲”的束缚，突出罪与非罪、正义与邪恶的冲突，并力求在这种冲突中展示人物的心态和社会的世态。但它毕竟处于转型期，带有明显的过渡性和不成熟性，反映出创作人员的困惑。
    困惑之一，题材过于偏窄。目前法制影视较多表现的是刑法的内容，而涉及民法、经济法、行政法以及我国人民司法制度的颇为罕见。有的创作者和相当一部分观众似乎形成了一种思维定势：即法制影视＝凶杀破案。其实，在现实生活中，无论家庭关系、婚恋关系、继承关系、子女教育等，无一不和法制有关，也是完全应当加以艺术化表现的。如何求真、求深、求新地再现我国法制建设过程中人们心态的撞击和观念的更新，更是法制影视有待开掘的题材，大有文章可做。
    困惑之二，故事内容的法律“偏差”。艺术当然允许虚构，但它必须在生活真实的基础上进行，必须有法律依据。否则就失去了艺术真实的基础。有些编导由于不谙法律常识，却又一味追求离奇，编造悬念，致使一些故事情节不能准确地反映司法实践，连常识性的办案程序也会与法律规定相去甚远，贻笑世人。
    困惑之三，审美层次的倾斜。在考虑法制影视观赏性、娱乐性的同时，必须注重审美价值。有些编导热衷于在影视片中对犯罪事实作自然主义的表现，采用“慢镜头”、“特写镜头”、“定格”大肆渲染，至于如何把镜头深入到人物的深层心理去展示罪与非罪、正义与邪恶的矛盾冲突，如何通过揭示犯罪的社会、历史、个人、道德、心理等多种原因来给人以深沉的思想启迪和心灵感染，则很少顾及。另外，目前相当一部分法制影视作品的表现手法每每失之陈旧，流于公式。
      “困惑”和“选择”往往是伴随而来。广大观众、影视界和法学界人士殷切盼望法制影视创作跃出“困惑”，走上新的台阶。
