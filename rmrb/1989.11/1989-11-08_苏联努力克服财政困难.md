The current development and transformation of the Soviet Union's national economy are facing a complex situation. There are noticeable advancements, but there are also some contradictions.

Overall, in the past four years, the Soviet Union has persisted in reforming its economic system and actively reversing the stagnation and crisis of socio-economic development in the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s. This has accelerated the growth rates of industrial and agricultural production, enterprise profits, and national income compared to previous years. Wages and social welfare funds have also seen improvements. However, at the same time, the state's fiscal revenue and expenditure, as well as the supply and demand relationship in the market, are imbalanced. Inflation is worsening, national debt is increasing, the foreign trade situation is deteriorating, and foreign debt has exceeded the warning line. Various indicators suggest that the Soviet Union's financial situation is severe. Gorbachev pointed out, "The state's financial system is seriously paralyzed, and the consumer market is chaotic." Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and economic expert Abalkin emphasized, "The state is now in an extremely difficult situation, in a state of crisis." Economic expert Shmelev, in his speech at the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, said: "If we do not stop the snowball-like growth of inflation, the decline of the consumer market, and the enormous budget deficit, which is a record in the world in terms of national income, we may face economic collapse in the next two to three years."

What are the causes of the financial difficulties in the Soviet Union? Chairman of the Council of Ministers Ryzhkov said that the "heavy burden that dragged the state into the crisis abyss" before April 1985 was much more severe than people had imagined; during the first four years of the 1986-1990 five-year plan, state revenue decreased by approximately 40 billion rubles, while expenditures increased by 62 billion rubles compared to the plan. This undoubtedly had a certain impact on fiscal balance. Additionally, the rate of wage increases exceeded the rate of labor productivity growth, basic construction projects broke through planned limits and developed abnormally, enormous military expenditures, and the massive costs of state management are also important reasons for the state's financial difficulties.

To address the existing financial difficulties, the Soviet government has formulated a plan to make the fiscal economy healthy. The core of this plan is to reallocate existing resources according to needs and to firmly move towards a new economic model through reform. Chairman of the Council of Ministers Ryzhkov said that the plan will be implemented in two stages. In the first stage, the budget deficit will be reduced by 29 billion and 34 billion rubles in the next two years, respectively; in the second stage, the budget deficit will be eliminated in the next five-year plan (1991-1995).

To achieve the set goals, the Soviet Union has taken a series of measures, among which the more significant ones are:

	Significantly reducing basic construction and firmly stopping the "construction boom." The focus of the reduction is on investments that do not directly improve the living conditions of residents and the production of consumer goods. Starting next year, state grants will be canceled for new production projects, and units will invest using their own earnings and loans, strictly aligning the scale of basic construction with existing capabilities, material resources, and labor resources.

	Reducing military expenditures and increasing the production of civilian products in the military industry. The military budget for 1990-1991 will be further reduced by 14%, and by 1995, military expenditures will be reduced to 6% to 4.5% of national income. This year, the growth rate of civilian product and consumer goods production in the military industry will be more than double that of military products, and the proportion of civilian products and consumer goods in the total output value of the military industry will reach 40%, reaching 46% by the end of 1990, and 60% by 1995.

	Reducing management costs in various aspects of the state. The central-level management agencies have undergone reorganization, canceling a series of ministries and supervisory departments, and reducing more than 600,000 people, correspondingly reducing budget allocations. The streamlining of local management agencies, as well as management personnel at the level of joint ventures and enterprises, is also on the agenda.

	Exploring the potential of various sectors of the national economy and rapidly increasing the market supply of consumer goods and food. Through the implementation of the technological transformation plan for light industry and the conversion of a batch of heavy industry enterprises, it is ensured that 37 billion rubles of daily consumer goods will be increased this year, and 450 to 500 billion rubles of daily consumer goods will be increased next year, which is 4 times the growth rate of the past three years. For many years, the loss of agricultural products in transportation, processing, and storage has been as high as 1/4. The state plans to improve management technology and modernize the equipment of these links, aiming to obtain an additional 40 billion rubles worth of food by 1995, and to achieve an average annual output value of 2000 billion rubles for food during the 1991-1995 period, which is an increase of 700 billion rubles compared to 1988. This requires at least a 5% increase per year.

	Deepening economic system reform and gradually transitioning to a new economic model. In the past four years, the Soviet Union has taken a series of major steps in the process of economic reform. Currently, laws such as the state-owned enterprise law, cooperative law, and lease system regulations are being implemented. In terms of improving the management organizational structure, the central management agencies have undergone reorganization, and various forms of joint ventures have been established. In the near future, measures to reform the economic system include: on the basis of utilizing various forms of ownership and new structural forms, improving the economic accounting model, creating equal conditions for developing various management forms on a competitive basis; forming an effective mechanism for managing and regulating the market; formulating new principles for tax policies, ensuring fair fiscal relations between the state, republics, localities, enterprises, and residents.

To reverse the current financial difficulties, the Soviet Union involves the entire national economy and all aspects of the state, and the task is undoubtedly arduous and complex. However, as the reform deepens, the Soviet Union is utilizing its enormous production capacity, trying every means to overcome financial difficulties, and making social production better meet the needs of the people.

    苏联努力克服财政困难
    王崇杰
    当前苏联国民经济的发展与变革正面临复杂局面。既有明显的进展，也出现一些矛盾。
    总的来看，最近4年苏联坚持改革经济体制，积极扭转70年代和80年代前半期社会经济发展的停滞和危机状态，使工农业生产、企业利润和国民收入的增长速度比以前加快，工资和社会福利基金也有了提高。但与此同时，国家的财政收支和市场商品的供求关系失衡，通货膨胀加剧，国债增长，外贸状况恶化，外债额超过警戒线。种种迹象表明，苏联的财政形势是严峻的。戈尔巴乔夫指出，“国家的财政体系严重瘫痪，消费市场紊乱”。部长会议副主席、经济专家阿巴尔金强调，“国家现在处于极其困难的境地，处于危机状态”。经济专家什梅廖夫在苏联人民代表大会上发言时说：“如果我们不制止像雪球一样不断增长的通货膨胀、消费市场的衰落、以及巨大的和按国民生产总值计算在世界上是创纪录的预算赤字，那么我们在两三年内就可能遇到经济崩溃。”
    苏联发生财政困难的原因何在？部长会议主席雷日科夫说，1985年4月以前遗留下来的“把国家拖进危机谷底的沉重负担”，比人们设想的严重得多；在1986—1990五年计划的头4年，国家收入减少约400亿卢布，支出却比计划增加620亿卢布。这无疑对财政平衡产生了一定影响。此外，工资的增长速度超过劳动生产率的增长速度，基本建设突破计划畸型发展，巨额军费开支和国家管理费用庞大等，也是造成国家入不敷出的重要原因。
    针对现存的财政困难，苏联政府制定了使财政经济健全化的计划。其核心是，根据需要重新考虑对现有资源的再分配，并坚定不移地通过改革走向新的经济模式。苏联部长会议主席雷日科夫说，该计划分两个阶段实施。第一阶段，今明两年分别使预算赤字减少290亿和340亿卢布；第二阶段，在下个五年计划（1991—1995）期间切实消除财政赤字。
    为实现既定目标，苏联采取了一系列措施，其中比较重大的有：
    大大压缩基本建设，坚决刹住“建设风”。压缩的重点是那些不直接用来改善居民生活条件和生产消费品的投资。从明年开始对新开工的生产性工程项目取消国家无偿拨款，各单位用自己赚的钱和贷款投资，严格使基本建设的规模同现有实力、物资和劳动资源相适应。
    削减军费开支，使军工部门增加民用产品的生产。1990—1991年的军费计划再削减14％，到1995年军费将减到占国民收入的6％至4.5％。今年军工部门民用产品和消费品生产的增长速度将比军事产品提高1倍多，民用产品和消费品在军工部门的总产值中所占比重将达到40％，到1990年末将占46％，1995年将达60％。
    减少国家各方面的管理费用。对中央一级的管理机构已实行改组，取消一系列部和主管部门，精简60多万人，相应削减了预算拨款。精简地方管理机构以及联合公司和企业一级的管理人员也提上了日程。
    挖掘国民经济各部门的潜力，迅速增加消费品和食品的市场供应量。通过实施轻工业技术改造计划和使一批重工业企业转产，保证今年增加370亿卢布日用消费品，明年将比今年再增加450至500亿卢布日用消费品，这比过去3年的增长速度快4倍。多年来农产品在运输、加工和储存等环节的损失高达1／4，国家计划通过提高管理技术和使这些环节的设备现代化，争取到1995年多获得价值达400亿卢布的食品，1991—1995年期间使食品的平均年产值达2000亿卢布，即比1988年增加700亿卢布，这要求每年至少增加5％。
    深化经济体制改革，逐步向新经济模式过渡。近4年苏联在经济改革进程中已采取一系列重大步骤，目前，国营企业法、合作社法和实行租赁制法令等都在贯彻实施。在完善管理组织结构方面，已对中央管理机构实行改组，建立了多种形式的联合公司等。近期内改革经济体制的措施还有：在利用各种所有制形式和新的结构形式的基础上完善经济核算模式，为在竞争基础上发展各种管理形式创造平等的条件；形成管理和调节市场的有效机制；制定税收政策的新原则，确保国家、加盟共和国、地方、企业和居民之间公正的财政关系。
    苏联要扭转当前的财政困难，涉及到整个国民经济和国家的各个方面，任务无疑是相当艰巨和复杂的。但随着改革的不断深入，苏联正利用其巨大的生产能力，想方设法克服财政困难，使社会生产更好地满足人民的需求。
