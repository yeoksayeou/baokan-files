The world's women's volleyball "uncrowned champion" Cuba team faced off against last year's Olympic gold medal winner, the Soviet Union team, in the second round. The Cuban girls have long wanted to taste the sweetness of victory, and the main attacker, Luis, said that the best gift she could bring back to her daughter this time is a gold medal. The Soviet team was not to be outdone, stating that the outcome would be decided on the court. Before the match, the Soviet team even played a psychological trick, spreading the news that their main setter, Barupovich, was injured and unable to play. However, when the referee's whistle blew, Barupovich was seen standing in her position.

In the first set, Cuba's strong attacking prowess was fully displayed, scoring 7 points out of 15 through spikes. In contrast, the Soviet team, known for their high serves and spikes, looked completely different. In the first set, they only scored 4 points, with only 1 point coming from a spike, and the remaining 3 points were all due to Cuba's mistakes.

In the second set, Cuba's serves became the main weapon for their advantage. The serves not only directly scored 4 points but also disrupted the Soviet team's reception, making it difficult for them to organize effective attacks. The Soviet team only scored 2 points from spikes in this set.

In the third set, the Soviet team actively organized their attacks and strengthened their blocking. However, Cuba's blocking was even more outstanding, suppressing the Soviet team's high spikes and keeping them in a passive position throughout. The Soviet team eventually lost the set 15-12.

Overall, the match did not see the intense competition that people had expected. The Cuban team was always in control, creating a one-sided situation. The Soviet women's volleyball coach's loud shouts from the sidelines also failed to reverse the trend, and he even received a yellow card warning.

From the famous player – No. 3 Luis – one can see a reflection of the Cuban team's technical maturity. Luis's high-point spikes were as powerful as ever, and she occasionally executed quick attacks and soft tips, making her attacks even more threatening. Luis also saved several critical balls, showing significant improvement in her defensive skills.

In the post-match press conference, the Cuban team's head coach, Eugenio, did not boast about his team's technical progress. He said that ample stamina and excellent jumping ability were the keys to Cuba's victory. He also mentioned that due to the high quality of their serves and effective blocking, they did not need to strengthen their backcourt defense. He added that with the retirement of players like Capote and La Gonzalez, the current Cuban team's strength is not as strong as it was two years ago.

When asked by a reporter to comment on the upcoming match between China and Cuba, Eugenio simply said that the Cuban team would strive to defeat the Chinese team. He described the Chinese team as an outstanding team with a balanced set of skills.

    这场比赛为何一面倒
    ——记古巴苏联女排之战
    世界女排“无冕之王”古巴队第二轮与去年奥运会金牌得主苏联队相遇了。古巴姑娘早就想尝尝冠军滋味，主攻手路易斯说，这次回国带给女儿的最好礼物是一枚金牌。苏联队也不甘示弱，称胜负场上才见分晓。赛前苏队还施疑兵之计，放出主力二传左手负伤难以出场的消息。比赛笛声吹响之后，人们看到主力二传巴鲁波邱克就站在自己的位置上。
    第一局，古巴队的强攻特长表现得淋漓尽致，在15分中有7分是扣球得分。相反，以高举高打为特点的苏联队则面目全非，首局所得的4分中仅有一分是打探头球得到的，其余3分都是靠古巴队失误得到的。
    第二局，古巴队的发球成为占上风的主要武器。发球不仅直接得到4分，还破坏了苏队的一传，使苏队难以组织起有效的进攻。苏队在这局得到的6分中，只有2分是扣球得分。
    第三局，苏联队积极组织进攻，并加强了拦网。然而古巴队的拦网更为出色，抑制了苏联队的高打强攻，使苏联队始终没有摆脱被动局面，最后以15∶12拿下。
    综观比赛过程，并没有出现人们预想的激烈争夺场面，古巴队一直处于主动，形成一面倒的形势。苏联女排教练在场外的不断大声叫喊，也未能挽回颓势，还受到一次黄牌警告。
    从著名球星——3号路易斯的身上，可以看到古巴队技术趋于全面成熟的缩影。路易斯高点强攻的威力不仅一如既往，还不时打出快攻和轻吊，使她的进攻力更有威胁。路易斯并多次救起险球，防守技术也大有提高。
    在比赛后的记者招待会中，古巴队主教练欧亨尼奥并没有夸耀己队在技术上的进步，只说充沛的体力和出色的弹跳是古巴队取胜的关键。并说由于今天的发球质量高，拦网有效，没有调上加强后排防守的队员。他还说，由于卡波特、拉·冈萨雷斯的引退，现在古巴队的实力不比前两年更强。
    记者请欧亨尼奥展望后天中国队与古巴队的比赛，他只是说，古巴队力争战胜中国队。中国队是一支出色的队伍，技术比较平衡。
