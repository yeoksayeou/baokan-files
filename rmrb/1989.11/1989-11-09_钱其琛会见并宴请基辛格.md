Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 8th.

Today evening, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with former U.S. Secretary of State Dr. Henry Kissinger at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse and hosted a welcome dinner for Dr. Kissinger and his wife.

In his toast, Qian Qichen said that Dr. Kissinger is an old friend of the Chinese people and one of the pioneers of Sino-U.S. relations. At this moment when Sino-U.S. relations are facing difficulties, he has once again come to Beijing with the courage of a statesman and the foresight of a strategist.

He said, looking back at history, we see that the differences between the two countries in social systems and ideologies have not hindered the establishment and development of relations. As long as we adhere to the basic principles established by the three Sino-U.S. joint communiqués, these differences should not and will not be obstacles to maintaining and further developing Sino-U.S. relations.

Foreign Minister Qian said, we believe that with the passage of time, people will discover such an objective reality: that there are long-term major common interests between China and the United States. China hopes to end the unpleasant entanglements between the two countries in the past few months as soon as possible and jointly open up the future.

He added, we have made great efforts to maintain the relationship between the two countries. However, the matter does not depend on us alone. We look forward to the U.S. government taking the initiative.

In his response, Kissinger expressed his thanks to Foreign Minister Qian and the Chinese Foreign Ministry for inviting him to visit China. He emphasized that he continues to attach great importance to the development of close relations between the United States and China.

Kissinger pointed out that over the years, despite various differences, the two countries have found important common interests. This has been the case since the drafting of the "Shanghai Communiqué" 17 years ago. He said that the national interests of the United States require the United States to seek to strengthen understanding with China. However, there is one more point: in order for a U.S. foreign policy to gain the support of the American people, it must reflect both the national interests of the United States and the democratic values and traditions of the United States.

Kissinger said that some Americans believe that, under the current circumstances, China should take the first step, while some Chinese believe that the United States should take the first step. He believes that since stability and peace are in the common interests of the two countries, the two countries should take steps together to make the relationship between the two countries develop more smoothly.

    钱其琛会见并宴请基辛格
    本报北京11月8日讯　记者孙毅报道：今天晚上，中国外交部部长钱其琛在钓鱼台国宾馆会见了美国前国务卿亨利·基辛格博士，并为基辛格博士及夫人举行了欢迎宴会。
    钱其琛在祝酒辞中说，基辛格博士是中国人民的老朋友，是中美关系的开拓者之一。今天，在中美关系面临困难的严峻时刻，他又一次以政治家的勇气和战略家的远见来到北京。
    他说，回顾历史，我们看到，中美两国在社会制度和意识形态方面的差别，并没有妨碍两国建立和发展关系。只要我们恪守中美三个联合公报确定的基本原则，这些差别现在和将来也不应成为保持和进一步发展中美关系的障碍。
    钱外长说，我们相信，随着时间的推移，人们将会发现这样的客观现实，即中美之间有着长远的重大共同利益。中国希望尽快结束中美间这几个月来不愉快的纠葛，共同开辟未来。
    他接着说，我们为了维护两国关系作出了很大的努力。但是事情不取决于我们单方面。我们期待着美国政府采取主动行动。
    基辛格在致答辞时表示，感谢钱外长和中国外交部邀请他访华。他强调说，他继续重视美国同中国发展密切的关系。
    基辛格指出，多年来，两国尽管有各种分歧，但双方发现彼此间有重要的共同利益。自17年前“上海公报”起草以来，情况一直如此。他说，美国的国家利益要求美国谋求加强同中国的谅解。不过还有一点，就是一项美国的外交政策要得到美国人民的支持，就必须既反映美国的国家利益，也要反映美国的民主价值观念传统。
    基辛格说，一些美国人认为，在目前的情况下，中国应走第一步，而一些中国人认为，美国应走第一步。他认为，由于稳定与和平符合两国的共同利益，两国应该共同采取步骤，使双方的关系更顺利地发展。
