		The State Taxation Administration's Director Jin Xin reported at a teleconference held today that since the State Council issued the "Decision on Strengthening Tax Administration for Urban and Rural Individual Households and Private Enterprises," various local departments have worked tirelessly. This year, the goal of achieving a breakthrough in individual tax revenue has been basically realized in four aspects: First, a comprehensive tax law education campaign has been conducted for individual business households, significantly improving the tax awareness of the majority of individual business owners. Second, based on self-inspections, all localities have focused their efforts on conducting professional inspections and have seriously investigated and dealt with a number of major tax evaders. Statistics show that by mid-October, Shandong, Sichuan, and Jiangsu provinces alone had investigated and dealt with 4,056 cases of tax evasion exceeding 100,000 yuan. From January to October, the country has recovered 2.067 billion yuan in evaded taxes. Third, individual tax revenue has increased significantly. From January to October, 103.75 billion yuan has been collected. Fourth, the tax administration system and methods for individual tax revenue are being established and improved.
