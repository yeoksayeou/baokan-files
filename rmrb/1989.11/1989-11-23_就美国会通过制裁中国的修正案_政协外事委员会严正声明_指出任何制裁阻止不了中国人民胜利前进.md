Statement on the U.S. Congress Passing the Amendment to Sanction China

Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee Foreign Affairs Committee

(November 22, 1989)

The U.S. House of Representatives and Senate passed the so-called State Department Authorization Act Amendment to sanction China on November 15th and 16th, 1989, respectively. The Chinese government has lodged a strong protest and conducted serious negotiations over this issue. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress has also issued a statement. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee fully supports the Chinese government's serious stance and completely agrees with the statement issued by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress. We strongly condemn and express the utmost indignation over this new escalation of interference in China's internal affairs by the U.S. Congress.

The Chinese government, in accordance with the constitution and laws, has suppressed the counter-revolutionary rebellion aimed at overthrowing the legitimate government and subverting the socialist system. This is purely an internal affair of China and does not infringe upon the interests of the United States in any way. It is certain factions in the United States that have deeply involved themselves in this rebellion, playing a highly disgraceful role and owing an account to the Chinese people. Now, the U.S. Congress, disregarding the repeated objections of the Chinese government, has unilaterally passed a bill to further sanction China. This is another serious step in worsening relations between the two countries. It has greatly hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and fully exposed the ugly face of hegemony. The U.S. Congress must bear all the consequences arising from this.

The Chinese people have never been afraid of ghosts or superstitions. Since the founding of New China, international reactionary forces have long implemented political isolation, economic blockade, and even military threats against our country, but they have not been able to stop the Chinese people from marching forward to victory. Now, the sanctions proposed by the U.S. Congress against China will also not succeed. They can only arouse the patriotic spirit of the Chinese people, making our country even more determined to strive for progress. On issues concerning national sovereignty and national dignity, China has never yielded to external pressure and will never compromise on principles. The facts have proven that the U.S. sanctions against China have also harmed U.S. interests and gone against the wishes of the American people.

The Chinese government has always insisted on developing friendly relations with all countries, including the United States, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence: mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. China has always advocated that all peoples have the right to choose their own social system and path of development. China does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and will never allow any country to interfere in China's internal affairs or impose their social system and values on the Chinese people. The current serious difficulties in Sino-U.S. relations are entirely the result of U.S. actions. The future development of Sino-U.S. relations will depend entirely on the U.S. side.

    新华社北京十一月二十二日电　关于美国国会通过制裁中国的修正案的严正声明
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会外事委员会
            （一九八九年十一月二十二日）
    美国众、参两院于一九八九年十一月十五日、十六日相继通过了制裁中国的所谓国务院授权法修正案。我国政府就此进行了严正交涉，提出了强烈抗议，全国人大外事委员会发表了声明。中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会外事委员会，坚决支持我国政府的严正立场，完全赞同全国人大外事委员会的声明。我们对美国国会这种干涉中国内政的新的升级，表示极大的愤慨和最强烈的谴责。
    中国政府根据宪法和法律，平息旨在推翻合法政府、颠覆社会主义制度的反革命暴乱，纯属中国的内政，丝毫也没有触犯美国的利益。倒是美国的某些势力深深地卷入了这场暴乱，扮演了极不光彩的角色，欠下了中国人民的帐。现在，美国国会竟然不顾中国政府的一再反对，一意孤行地通过了进一步制裁中国的议案，这是恶化两国关系的又一严重步骤。极大地伤害了中国人民的感情，充分暴露了霸权主义的丑恶面目。美国国会必须承担由此而引起的一切后果。
    中国人民是从来不怕鬼、不信邪的。新中国建立以来，国际反动势力曾经长期对我国实行政治孤立、经济封锁乃至军事威胁，都未能阻止中国人民胜利前进。现在，美国国会提出的对中国的制裁，也是不能得逞的。它只能激起中国人民的爱国主义精神，使我国更加奋发图强。在关系到国家主权和民族尊严的问题上，中国从来就没有屈服于外来的压力，也决不拿原则作交易。事实证明，美国对中国的制裁也损害了美国自身的利益，违背了美国广大人民的意愿。
    中国政府一贯坚持在互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处五项原则的基础上同包括美国在内的世界各国发展友好关系。中国历来主张各国人民有权选择自己的社会制度和发展道路。中国从不干涉别国的内政，也决不允许任何国家干涉中国的内政，将他们的社会制度和价值观念强加在中国人民头上。目前中美关系出现的严重困难，是美国一手造成的。今后中美关系如何发展完全取决于美国方面。
