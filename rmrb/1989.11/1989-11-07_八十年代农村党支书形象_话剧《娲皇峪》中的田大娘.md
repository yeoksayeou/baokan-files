The War Friend Drama Troupe, which left a deep impression on audiences in the 1960s with the creation and performance of the play *Huai Shu Zhuang*, recently staged their new play *Wa Huang Yu* (written by Wei Jinhu and Zhai Yingchun, directed by Wei Min) on the capital's stage.

The image of Guo Dama, the leading figure in the socialist path and the village-level Party branch secretary in *Huai Shu Zhuang*, has entered the gallery of characters in Chinese socialist drama art. To this day, it retains its unique artistic vitality. Since then, such vivid and natural images of grassroots Party branch secretaries have been rare. In recent years, due to the neglect of revolutionary literary traditions and the indifference towards advanced figures in real life, such character images have almost disappeared from the stage of spoken drama. *Wa Huang Yu* deeply and affectionately portrays the image of Auntie Tian, a village-level Party branch secretary in the 1980s, making her vividly and movingly come to life on stage, demonstrating the artistic courage and resolve of the play's creators.

The village where Auntie Tian resides, Wa Huang Yu, is rich in the realistic characteristics of 1980s Chinese villages: reform and opening up have brought new vitality to this old village in the Taihang Mountains, but they have also complicated the contradictions in life and increased the difficulties of the Party's grassroots work in the countryside. The reality of Wa Huang Yu presented on stage is a mix of beauty and ugliness, a patchwork of colors. Ancient and closed living concepts and customs still shroud the villagers' lives, and the arrogance of a few who have amassed wealth through speculation openly challenges people's established social order. What about revolutionary traditions, Party principles, and the image of the Party? In the minds of some Party members, these have become outdated and rigid things. The tide of life brings all kinds of life tragedies: the betrayal of the poor for the rich, the abandonment of wives, the desperation of selling daughters, and the farcical adoption of children, the ambiguous breaking of dishes, and funerals... All these dark and heavy aspects of life are revealed without reservation.

Auntie Tian's image, as the focal point of all these life contradictions, stands out with the true light of a Communist Party member against this dark and chaotic background. She is like a sturdy tree standing independently, unyielding in the face of evil winds, upholding justice without yielding, sharp enough to deter evil, and warm enough to bring spring. In this illiterate old woman from the countryside, we see the true image of a Communist Party member that we have long missed, with a sense of righteousness surging in our hearts and spirits uplifted!

It is precisely because Auntie Tian's image is based on a solid foundation of life that the dramatic conflicts and struggles surrounding her are refined, avoiding ideological abstractions and filled with the breath of life. Auntie Tian is both a Party branch secretary and the actual head of a household with tens of millions of yuan from mining. This unique identity makes her face many unique conflicts and psychological pressures in the village and at home, forging her unique inner world. Auntie Tian, due to her special background as an adopted child of a Red Army couple and decades of Party education, has a pure affection for the Communist Party and a high political awareness. She always harbors a spirit of progress, determined to use her wealth earned through labor for the construction of her hometown and to help her neighbors out of difficulties. Selfless dedication is the main theme of her spiritual world.

However, Auntie Tian is also a woman who has lived in the countryside for a long time, a housewife. Her speech, behavior, thoughts, and actions are inseparable from the specific environment and customs of the countryside, as well as the interpersonal relationships formed by the long and intense historical changes in the countryside (such as the relationship between the Iron family and the Tian family during the Cultural Revolution). Therefore, her high "spirit" and her unsophisticated reality, her shadowy and talkative demeanor, form a contradictory unity with a strong sense of individuality. This is vividly and richly expressed in her conflicts and struggles with her husband Tian Zenglu and the old Party member Tian Shunxin who did not make the register. The Auntie Tian who appears before the audience is not a "filtered" and "purified" "hero" who is pale and hollow with grand words, but a living character who bears the pressures of reality, is not free from confusion and grief, but still retains the pure heart of a child.

Of course, in terms of insisting on creating advanced characters from life, some scenes and details in this play are still somewhat rigid. Upon closer examination, these flaws are largely due to the limitations of the life prototype and certain ideologies. Exploring the inner world of advanced characters in the 1980s and presenting their concrete living forms is an artistic topic that has been neglected for a considerable period. The gains and losses of *Wa Huang Yu* in practicing this topic provide valuable experience and lessons for our literary creation.

It is worth praising that the actors of the War Friend Drama Troupe have made commendable efforts to bring this play to the stage. Their performance style is simple and natural, bold and fiery, with a humorous flavor, giving a full and satisfying feeling of the stage. During the performance, young soldier audiences were very active, often bursting into laughter. They were obviously "captured" by this play. Such a theatrical effect is undeniable, and it has made many drama experts in the audience ponder.

### 八十年代农村党支书形象——话剧《娲皇峪》中的田大娘

    八十年代农村党支书形象
    ——话剧《娲皇峪》中的田大娘
    曾镇南
    六十年代曾以创作和演出话剧《槐树庄》而给观众留下深刻印象的战友话剧团，最近在首都舞台上演出了他们的新戏《娲皇峪》（魏金虎、翟迎春编剧，魏敏导演）。
    《槐树庄》所塑造的走社会主义道路的带头人、农村基层党支书郭大娘的形象，已经进入了我国社会主义话剧艺术的人物画廊之中，至今仍葆有着它特有的艺术生命力。从那以后，像这样血肉饱满、真切自然的基层党支书的形象就很少出现了。近年来，由于对革命文艺传统的忽视和对现实生活中先进人物的淡漠，话剧舞台上这一类人物形象几近绝迹了。《娲皇峪》充满深情地塑造了田大娘这个八十年代农村基层党支书的形象，使她真切感人地活在舞台上，表现了编导们艺术家的胆识和勇气。
    田大娘所在的村庄娲皇峪是富有八十年代中国农村的现实特征的：改革与开放给这个太行山老区的村子带来了新的生机与活力，然而也使生活的矛盾复杂化了，使党的基层组织在农村的工作的难度提高了。展现在舞台上的娲皇峪的现实生活形态是美丑杂陈、斑驳陆离的。古老、封闭的生活观念与风俗习惯依然笼罩着村民们的生活，少数人投机暴富所养成的骄横气焰公然冲击着人们固有的社会秩序。什么革命的传统、党的原则、党的形象，在一些党员心目中已成了背时、僵化的东西。生活的潮流裹挟着各种人生悲剧纷至沓来：嫌贫爱富的背约，伤天害理的弃妻，走投无路的卖女和啼笑皆非的纳子，难辨滋味的摔盆和出殡，……这一切生活中阴暗的、沉重的东西毫无讳饰地揭示出来。
    而田大娘的形象，作为所有这些生活矛盾交汇的焦点，在这晦暗而混乱的背景上，显出了真正的共产党员的思想光辉。她像独立支持的大树，临恶风而不弯，行公道而不徇，锋棱足以慑邪，温爱自能回春。在这样一个文化不高的农村老大娘身上，我们看到了久违了的真正的共产党员的形象，浩然之气激荡胸怀，精神为之一振！
    正因为田大娘的形象是依托于坚实的生活基础之上的，所以，环绕着她而展开的戏剧矛盾和冲突的提炼，就避免了理念化而充满了生活的气息。田大娘既是党支书，又是因办矿而先富起来的几十万元户的实际户主。这种特殊的身份，使她在村里和家里，遇到了诸多特殊的矛盾、特殊的心理压力，也铸成了她特殊的内心世界。田大娘，由于她曾是红军夫妇收养的弃婴的特殊身世和几十年党的教育，她具有老区基本群众对共产党纯朴的感情和较高的政治觉悟，始终怀着奋进之志，一心想用自己劳动所得的财富为家乡的建设出力，为乡邻的生计排难。大公无私的奉献精神，是她精神世界的主调。
    但是，田大娘又是一个长期生活在农村的妇女，是一个家庭的主妇，她的言谈举止，思考和行事的方式，都离不开农村的具体环境和生活习俗，也离不开农村长期剧烈的历史变迁所形成的人际关系（例如“文革”中铁家与田家和她的关系）。因此，她的很高的“心气儿”和未能脱俗的现实的形影谈吐，就构成了颇有个性化的矛盾统一体。这在她和丈夫田增禄、和没登上记的老党员田顺心的矛盾冲突中，得到了相当生动、丰富的表现。出现在观众面前的田大娘，不是那种满口豪言壮语实则苍白干瘪的“过滤”、“提纯”了的“英雄”，而是负荷着现实的各种压力、内心也不免惶惑和苦恼但仍葆有赤子之心的活生生的人物。
    当然，在坚持从生活出发塑造先进人物方面，这个戏的某些场面和细节，也还有些生硬之处。细究这些破绽，大抵是囿于生活原型和某些理念所致。探索八十年代先进人物的内心世界和表现他们具象的生存形态，这是一个相当长时间内被忽略了的艺术课题。《娲皇峪》在实践这一课题时的所得和所失，为我们的文学创作提供了可贵的经验和教训。
    值得称许的是，战友话剧团的演员们为把这个戏立在舞台上作出了可喜的努力。他们的表演风格，是质朴自然的，泼辣火爆的，有一种幽默的韵味，给人满台都是戏的饱满之感。在演出过程中，年青的战士观众非常活跃，不时爆发出会心的笑声。他们显然是被这个戏“抓”住了。这样的剧场效果是无可置疑的，它使在座的很多戏剧专家们陷入了思索。
