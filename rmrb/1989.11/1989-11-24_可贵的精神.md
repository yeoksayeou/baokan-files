Opening the November 15 edition of People's Daily, I saw a headline on the front page: "On November 8, the factory committee of the Capital Iron and Steel Corporation announced to all workers the following decision: Due to the entire company not completing the monthly plan for October, which was arranged to increase annual profits by 20%, the company fell short by 42.01 million yuan in profit. According to the contract responsibility system regulations, the company will not issue bonuses for this month... Currently, the broad masses of workers at Capital Steel are in high spirits. They have expressed their determination to seize the remaining days of this year to make up for the losses and complete this year's contract plan."

Reading this news, especially when I read, "Factory committee chairman Zhou Guanwu, general manager Zhao Changbai, and the manager of the North Steel plant, Xu Yongqi, made self-criticisms to the workers. Some workers shed tears for not completing the plan. Many units' workers not only had no objections to the deduction of this month's bonuses but also signed petitions to the factory committee, expressing their willingness to use their own money to make up for the shortfall in profits," my eyes also welled up, and I couldn't help but feel my heart swell. In the midst of our country's takeoff, facing severe economic difficulties, how much we need our children to carry forward this sublime spirit of being masters of the state! The stability and development of the country is the happiness of every individual, and the difficulties of the country are the difficulties of every individual, requiring everyone to work together under the leadership of the Party. In a socialist country, the unity of the interests of the state, the collective (enterprise), and the individual can also be said to be the unity of the fundamental interests, long-term interests, and immediate interests of every individual. Carrying forward the spirit of being masters of the state is precisely based on this materialist understanding.

We must stand in the position of masters of the state to view and implement the contract responsibility system. Among responsibility, rights, and interests, responsibility comes first, followed by rights and interests, and it is certainly not the opposite, nor is it two eyes fixed on rights and interests while throwing responsibility to the winds. The strict implementation of contract regulations by Capital Steel and the attitude taken by the entire factory is a vivid embodiment of Capital Steel's workers carrying forward the spirit of being masters of the state. They do not forgive themselves for past contributions to the state and for completing the plan every month this year except for October, nor do they shirk responsibility and blame others for the fact that October's target was not met due to a major accident at the No. 3 blast furnace. Instead, they unite as one, striving with all their might to complete this year's contract plan. This is the sublime style and iron will of our country's working class! To divide the food in the state's big pot and put it into small pots, to take bonuses even when the contract plan is not completed or there are losses, is to find ways to eat from the big pot, how can this be called implementing the contract responsibility system? Since the contract responsibility system is being implemented, it must be strictly carried out according to the contract regulations, with everything in its proper place, just like Capital Steel. It can be said that strictness is the lifeblood of the contract responsibility system. As for how to make the contract responsibility system more scientific and more perfect, of course, we must explore and summarize experiences in practice, and even in special circumstances, we can make certain adjustments that are truly necessary according to procedures, but once regulations are made, they must be strictly implemented. If we can demand this strictness of ourselves with the attitude of masters of the state, then this strictness is not only an external force but also a highly conscious action of our own.

The times call for entrepreneurs. The fate of contemporary Chinese enterprises, in addition to economic system reform, also depends to a considerable extent on enterprise talents, especially the management personnel of factory directors and managers. One is the system, and the other is people; it takes both to work together. Implementing the contract responsibility system ultimately still relies on the entrepreneurial spirit of entrepreneurs and the efforts of all employees of the enterprise. Capital Steel is like this. Understanding the big picture and the overall situation, while striving for the reform and improvement of the enterprise, pooling wisdom and strength, overcoming the current economic difficulties, this is the glorious task facing every entrepreneur and every employee in the enterprise.

　　可贵的精神

    打开11月15日人民日报，看到一版的一条消息：“11月8日，首都钢铁公司工厂委员会向全体工作者宣布了这样一项决定：由于全公司10月没有完成按全年利润递增20％安排的月度计划，差利润4201万元，根据承包制度规定，这个月全公司不发奖金……现在首钢广大工作者情绪高昂，他们表示一定要抓紧今年的最后几十天时间，把损失夺回来，完成今年的承包计划。”
    读着这篇消息，特别是当我读到：“工厂委员会主任周冠五、总经理赵长白、发生事故的北钢经理徐永起向职工作了检查。一些职工为没完成计划掉了眼泪。许多单位职工不仅对扣发当月奖金没意见，还签名上书工厂委员会，表示要用自己的钱补上欠缺的利润”时，我的眼睛也湿润了，止不住心潮澎湃。在腾飞中遇到严峻经济困难的祖国，多么需要她的儿女们发扬这种崇高的国家主人翁精神啊！国家的稳定和发展是每个人的幸福，国家的困难也是每个人的困难，需要大家在党的领导下协力奋斗。在社会主义国家，国家、集体（企业）、个人三者利益的统一，也可以说就是每个人的根本利益、长远利益和眼前利益的统一。发扬国家主人翁的精神，正是建立在这种唯物主义认识的基础上。
    我们要站在国家主人翁的立场上来看待承包制，执行承包制。在责、权、利三者中，责字当头，权、利相随，而决不是相反，更不是两只眼睛盯着权和利而把责抛到九霄云外。首钢严格执行承包规定和全厂上下所采取的态度，正是首钢人发扬国家主人翁精神的生动体现。他们并不因过去对国家作出过重大贡献和今年连月完成计划仅10月未达指标而原谅自己，也不因10月未达指标是受3号高炉发生重大事故的影响而卸责埋怨，而是众志成城，一心为完成今年的承包计划而拚搏。这才是我国工人阶级的崇高风格和铮铮铁骨啊！把国家大锅里的饭分到小锅里吃，完不成承包计划甚至亏损而奖金照样拿，那是变着法儿吃大锅饭，怎能算得上是实行承包制呢？既然实行承包制，就要严格按承包规定办事，丁是丁，卯是卯，像首钢那样。可以说，严格就是承包制的生命。至于承包制怎样才能搞得更科学些，更完善些，当然要在实践中探索和总结经验，甚至在特殊情况下也可以按程序进行某些确属必要的调整，但规定下来后则必须严格执行。如果我们能以国家主人翁的态度要求自己，这种严格就不仅是一种外力，同时也是自己高度自觉的行动了。
    时代在呼唤企业家。当代中国企业之命运如何，除了经济体制改革之外，还在相当大的程度上取决于企业人才，特别是厂长、经理这一层管理人员的状况。一个是体制，一个是人，要靠两者的结合。实行承包制，归根结底还要靠企业家的锐意经营和企业全体职工的努力。首钢就是这样。顾大局、识大体，而又致力于企业的改革与提高，群策群力，战胜当前面临的经济困难，这就是摆在每个企业家和企业里每一个职工面前的光荣任务。
