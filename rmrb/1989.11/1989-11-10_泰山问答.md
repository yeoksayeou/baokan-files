Mount Tai, how old are you?
I softly ask, but Mount Tai remains silent.
Waterfalls cascade, with white hair flowing a thousand zhang long,
Mountain ranges stretch, with countless wrinkles.

I think of my mother—
When the first wrinkle appeared at the corner of her eye,
I reached out my small hand, trying to smooth it away.
When the first silver strand appeared at her temples,
I puckered my small mouth, trying to blow it away…

She smiled, her face instantly radiant with vitality.
For so many years, I still clearly remember
The clouds of joy on my mother's face,
The stars dancing in my mother's eyes…

I gaze at Mount Tai, and I think of the land of China that gave birth to me—
The mountain top is adorned with twinkling stars,
The valleys echo with the roar of pines.

Ah, with a sincere heart, the mother will forever stay young!

    泰山问答
    李洪波泰山，你有多大年龄？轻声问，泰山默默不答应，瀑布，甩千丈白发，山脉，横万道皱棱。我想起了我的母亲——当她的眼角泛开第一扇皱纹，我伸出小手抹呀、抹呀；当母亲鬓梢闪动第一缕银丝，我呶着小嘴吹呀、吹呀……她笑了，顿时奕奕神采，多少年啦，我还清楚地记得那笑在母亲脸上的彩云，那跳在母亲眼里的星星……我观泰山，我想起生养我的中华大地山顶——繁星闪烁，山间——松涛呼应。啊，孩儿心诚，母亲会永远年轻！
