Dr. Tsung-Dao Lee, a Chinese-American physicist, is a scientist who excels in both literature and science.

On May 9, 1984, Dr. Tsung-Dao Lee, while touring the famous Yuquan Temple in Tianzhu, Gansu Province, spontaneously composed a seven-character quatrain titled "Thinking of Jiangnan – Inscribed at the Ancient Yuquan Temple in Tianzhu, Gansu." It is truly a rare gem.

In May 1984, Dr. Tsung-Dao Lee was invited back to China to give lectures. During his spare time, he visited Tianzhu in Gansu Province. On the 9th, after thoroughly appreciating the world-renowned art treasures of the Maiji Shan Grottoes, he went to the famous Yuquan Temple in Tianzhu. At that time, standing high and looking far, he felt his mind and spirit soar: the Longshan Mountains stretched endlessly, creating a magnificent scene; the Wei River flowed eastward, presenting a grand spectacle. This scene and emotion suddenly stirred the poet in the scientist, and his thoughts wandered. Homesickness (Dr. Tsung-Dao Lee's ancestral home is in Jiangsu, and he was born in Shanghai) arose spontaneously. Thus, a poem titled "Thinking of Jiangnan – Inscribed at the Ancient Yuquan Temple in Tianzhu, Gansu" flowed from his heart:

	"Ancient and modern changes, jade and stone return to their homeland;
	The spring flows eastward, observing Longshan, thinking of Jiangnan."

This poem captures the scene and expresses genuine emotions: despite the changes of time and the passage of stars, even though he resides in a foreign land, his love for his country and longing for his hometown are like the ever-flowing Wei River and the ever-present Longshan Mountains. The entire poem is clear and natural, perfectly composed.

What is admirable is that Dr. Tsung-Dao Lee skillfully uses the form of a "hidden-word poem," embedding the subject of the poem at the beginning of each line, naturally and ingeniously pointing to the theme: praising the "Ancient Yuquan Temple" and "thinking of Jiangnan," making it seem effortless and without any trace of forced composition, leaving people in awe. This poem is now treasured in the Tianzhu City Cultural Museum of Gansu Province, becoming a gift from Dr. Tsung-Dao Lee to the people of Gansu.

    心香一瓣诉衷情
    ——记李政道博士的一首诗
    赵庭
    美籍华裔物理学家李政道博士是个文理并重、文理兼优的科学家。
    一九八四年五月九日，李政道博士在游览甘肃省天水名胜玉泉观即兴所作的七绝《思江南——题甘肃天水古玉泉观》，实为一首不可多得的佳作。
    一九八四年五月，李政道博士应邀回国讲学，空暇时曾前往甘肃天水观光。九日，在饱览了名闻中外的艺术宝库麦积山石窟后，又来到天水名胜玉泉观游览。斯时，登高远眺，心旷神怡：陇山连绵逶迤，蔚为壮观；渭水浩荡东来，气象万千。此景此情，顿使科学家诗兴勃发，浮想联翩。思乡之情（李政道博士祖籍江苏，生于上海），油然而生。于是，一首《思江南——题甘肃天水古玉泉观》从心底飞出：
    “古今沧桑变，玉石故乡还；
    泉水向东流，观陇思江南。”
    此诗即景生情，情真意切：尽管沧桑变化，斗转星移，虽身寄异国他域，但思国、怀乡之情有如渭水长流，陇山常驻。全诗明白如话，浑然天成。
    令人佩服的是，李政道博士还娴熟地以“藏头诗”的形式，将所言之事分藏于句首，巧妙地点题：咏“古玉泉观”，“思江南”，十分自然，毫无斧凿拼凑之痕迹，让人叫绝。该诗现珍藏于甘肃省天水市文化馆，成为李政道博士献给甘肃人民的一份礼物。
