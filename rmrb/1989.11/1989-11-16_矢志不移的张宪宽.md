During the tumultuous years, when the society was shouting "overthrow everything" and "smash everything," China's first controllable silicon pulse power machine tool was successfully developed in the Taishan Labor Reform Brigade. However, this achievement was made by a person who was cast aside by the times—Zhang Xiankuan. In addition, he successively developed more than ten major scientific research achievements that filled gaps in the nation's technology; he mastered English, Japanese, and German, translating nearly a million words of materials, and published many professional papers, some of which were excerpted and translated by foreign journals. He repeatedly declined high-paying job offers from various units and gave up the opportunity to settle in the United States, choosing to stay in the harsh conditions of the labor reform brigade, striving for the machine tool manufacturing industry of our country. He was honorably elected as a representative of the people of Tai'an City, a labor model of Shandong Province, and a first-class model of the national judicial system.

Zhang Xiankuan was born in Nanjing in 1936. At the age of three, he lost his father. During his childhood, he witnessed the brutal atrocities of Japanese imperialism. In 1948, his mother took him and his younger sister to Hong Kong. The following year, despite his mother's opposition, he returned to the mainland to study. Later, his mother and younger sister moved to the United States and repeatedly wrote to him, urging him to settle there.

After graduating from Peking University, he was assigned to teach at Shandong University. Because he sent a letter to his mother, he was accused of "colluding with imperialism," "slandering socialism," and "plotting to escape," and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was sent to the Jinan City Labor Reform Brigade, and due to illness and mental torment, his weight quickly dropped from the original 120 jin to over 60 jin. During a construction project, he suddenly collapsed and was sent to the hospital.

During his hospitalization, the political commissar of the labor reform brigade visited him several times, saying, "Intellectuals have a great future here. As long as you are willing to work hard, you can also serve the country." These words warmed Zhang Xiankuan's nearly numb heart. Not long after his discharge from the hospital, Zhang Xiankuan and Li Guihua, a professor at Shandong Institute of Technology who was wrongly labeled as a "rightist," formed an electric processing machine tool research group. This pair of old and new intellectuals hit it off immediately and began to work together.

For this student of chemistry, working with electricity was a completely new field, and he had to start from scratch. To meet the needs of his work, he learned Japanese and German in addition to the English he already knew. During the intense experimental period, he stayed in the laboratory for dozens of days in a row, eating and sleeping there. After more than a year of hard work, China's first controllable silicon pulse power machine tool was successfully developed.

To tackle one major scientific research project after another that filled gaps in the nation's technology, he spent all but five hours of sleep each day reading, looking up materials, and accumulating data. A book on "Electronic Tube Circuit Equipment" that would take a year to learn in university, he mastered in just two months. For more than ten years, he never took a day off or rested on a Sunday, whether he was on a business trip or during the Spring Festival, he never missed an opportunity to study. In 1973, when his sentence was completed, he was released and chose to stay in the brigade for employment. Later, he was promoted to engineer and technical director.

In 1984, when Zhang Xiankuan's case was completely rectified, more than 20 units, including the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Shenzhen University, competed to hire him. No matter which unit offered what favorable conditions, he politely declined. He said, "They need me here."

Soon, Zhang Xiankuan suddenly received a letter from his younger sister in Los Angeles, USA. The letter said, "...I hope you can come to the United States. Here, you can become a first-class scientist. All expenses will be covered by me." Some well-meaning relatives also said to him, "What is there to stay for here? No matter how good you do, you can only be a prison guard. America is rich..." After repeated consideration, Zhang Xiankuan firmly replied, "The motherland is my mother, my home. To dedicate oneself to the prosperity of the motherland is the responsibility of every Chinese."

    矢志不移的张宪宽
    本报记者　张雅心
    在那动乱的年代，当社会上大喊“打倒一切”、“砸烂一切”的时候，我国第一台可控硅脉冲电源加工机床，在泰山劳改支队研制成功了。然而这项成果却出自一个时代的弃儿——张宪宽之手。此外，他还先后研制成功了十多项包括填补国家空白的重大科研成果；掌握了英、日、德三种外语，翻译了近百万字的资料，发表许多篇专业论文，有的被国外刊物摘译；他多次谢绝有关单位的高薪聘请，放弃了到美国定居的机会，坚守在条件艰苦的劳改支队，为我国机床制造业发奋进取。他被光荣地选为泰安市人民代表、山东省劳动模范、全国司法系统一级英模。
    张宪宽1936年生于南京，三岁时丧父，他幼年时代目睹了日本帝国主义的残酷暴行。1948年母亲带他和妹妹去了香港，第二年他不顾母亲的反对回大陆就学。后来母亲和妹妹又移居美国并多次来信催促他去美国定居。
    北京大学毕业后，他被分配到山东大学任教。因为寄给母亲一封信，招来了“勾结帝国主义”、“污蔑社会主义”、“图谋叛逃”的罪名，被判了10年有期徒刑。他进了济南市劳改队，因疾病和精神上的折磨，他的体重很快由原来的120斤骤然减到60多斤。在一次施工中，他突然昏倒，被送进了医院。
    住院期间，劳改队政委多次到病房看望他，说：“知识分子在这里大有作为。只要你肯努力，同样能报效国家。”这话像一股暖流温暖了张宪宽已近麻木的心灵。出院后不久，张宪宽和被错划为“右派”的山东工学院教授李桂华一起组成了电加工机床研究小组。这一对新老知识分子一见如故，开始了携手合作。
    对他这位学生化专业的大学生来说，搞电是门外汉，一切从零开始。为了工作需要，他在已掌握英语的基础上，又自修了日语、德语。在实验紧张阶段，一连几十天不出实验室，吃住在那里。经过一年多的拚搏，我国第一台可控硅脉冲电源加工机床试制成功了。
    为了攻克一个又一个填补国家空白的重大科研项目，一天除五小时的睡眠外，都用来读书、查资料、积累数据，一本《电子管电路设备》在大学里要学一年，他只用了两个月。10多年他没请过一天假、没歇过一个星期天，无论是出差，还是过年过节，他从不放过点滴时间学习。1973年，他刑满释放留队就业，后来晋升为工程师、技术科长。
    1984年当张宪宽的冤案彻底平反时，先后有中国农科院、深圳大学等20多个单位竞相聘用他。无论哪家以什么优惠条件聘请，他都婉言谢绝了。他说：“这里需要我。”
    不久，张宪宽突然收到美国洛杉矶妹妹的来信，信中说：“……希望你能来美国，这里有条件可以使你成为第一流科学家，一切费用由我承担。”有些好心的亲友也对他说：“这里有什么值得留恋的，干得再好也只能是个狱吏，美国可富了……。”张宪宽经过反复思考坚定的回答：“祖国是我的母亲，是我的家，为祖国的繁荣而献身，是每个中华儿女的责任。”
