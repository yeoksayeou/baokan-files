The charm of the dance "Ah, Dabie Mountain" lies in its ability to depict the grandeur of the Liu-Deng Army's march into Dabie Mountain in just 10 minutes, and to recreate the spirit and demeanor of a ten-thousand-strong army with just 12 performers. This is the allure of the performance by the Guangzhou Military Region Soldiers' Song and Dance Troupe's "Ah, Dabie Mountain" (directed by Chen Mei).

From the 1960s' "Hard Times" and "Dadu River" to many works in the 1980s, dances reflecting the glorious history of our army are numerous. However, these works share a common feature: they all borrow from the dramatic form of expression to recreate a story full of drama.

"Ah, Dabie Mountain," however, breaks away from the old forms of expression. The work combines realism and poeticism, and the dancers are no longer specific soldiers but embodiments of the collective image of Dabie Mountain. Sometimes they are the mountain, sometimes they are people, and sometimes they are spirits. The entire dance breaks away from the dramatic structure, revealing a flow of spirit and belief. This method, which is rooted in reality yet transcends it, gives the work a style that is both simple and ethereal, and allows more space in the work to showcase the unique external beauty of dance art. It can be said that "Ah, Dabie Mountain" is not a story, but a spiritual expression written in the language of the human body. More precisely, it is the spirit of the people of Dabie Mountain.

Today, as films and television dramas are attracting more and more audiences, how dance can create a world that other art forms cannot replace has become an increasingly urgent issue for the dance world. Therefore, the creative practice of "Ah, Dabie Mountain" provides a valuable lesson for the future creation of historical dance works.

    历史的魅力
　　——评舞蹈《啊，大别山》
　　黄宣德
    以区区10分钟的舞蹈去表现当年刘邓大军挺进大别山的风貌，用寥寥12人再现万人之师的气势与风姿，这就是广州军区战士歌舞团演出的《啊，大别山》（陈梅编导）的魅力所在。
    从六十年代的《艰苦岁月》、《大渡河》到八十年代的许多作品，反映我军光荣历史的舞蹈早已不胜枚举。但这些作品有一个共同的特点，即都借用了戏剧的表现形式，以再现出一个充满戏剧性的故事。
    而《啊，大别山》却一反旧的表现形式。作品采用写实与写意相结合的手法，舞蹈者不再是某一个具体的战士，而是大别山群像的化身，时而他们是山，时而是人，时而又是魂。整个舞蹈摆脱了戏剧性的结构，显现的是一种精神、一种信念的流程。这种立足于现实而又超越了现实的手法，使作品的风格朴实而又飘逸，又使作品有更多的篇幅来显示舞蹈艺术独特的外部形式美。应该说，《啊，大别山》不是一个故事，而是人体语言谱写成的一种精神，更确切地说，是大别山人的精魂。
    今天，当电影、电视剧正卷走越来越多的观众时，舞蹈如何创造出一个其它艺术形式所无法取代的世界，正成为舞蹈界越来越紧迫的课题。因此，《啊，大别山》的创作实践对今后历史题材的舞蹈创作是一个有益的启示。
