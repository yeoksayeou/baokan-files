Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 24th —

Well-known brand-name drugs such as "Qianliekang," "Qingchunbao," and "Sanjiu Weitai" are currently facing serious threats from various counterfeit products. Representatives from several state-owned pharmaceutical companies held a meeting today, calling for the swift improvement of relevant policies and regulations to stop the counterfeiting and imitation of brand-name drugs for the sake of public health and the future of the country's pharmaceutical industry.

It is understood that in recent years, counterfeit and imitation drugs have become rampant. Some pharmaceutical companies, instead of focusing on developing new products, have exploited loopholes in drug production approvals by "transplanting" other companies' research results, even stealing packaging designs to create confusion in the market, causing significant disorder.

Zhejiang Lanxi Yunshan Pharmaceutical Factory spent 10 years and hundreds of millions of yuan to develop the pollen-based drug "Qianliekang," establishing a well-known brand. However, imitators soon followed, leading to a decline in the factory's reputation due to the poor quality of the counterfeit products, resulting in ineffective treatments for patients and difficulties in sales. After Guangzhou Guanghua Pharmaceutical Factory launched its fast-acting cold capsules, over 100 companies rushed to imitate it. Guangzhou Pangao Pharmaceutical Factory's snake gallbladder and bezoar liquid, and Datong Xinghuo Pharmaceutical Factory's lung treasure triple-effect tablets also faced numerous imitators. Counterfeit versions of Tianma pills and Wangzhuang products also flooded the market.

The quality of imitation drugs is poor, lacking competitiveness. Manufacturers use tactics such as giving kickbacks and red envelopes to promote their products, impacting brand-name drugs and disrupting the market and ethical standards.

Industry experts pointed out that counterfeit drugs pose a threat to public health. Since brand-name drugs often keep their technology secret, imitators obtain approval documents but cannot master the "true essence." Counterfeit drugs often have high costs and low efficacy, and some even cause toxic side effects due to unreasonable formulations and unscientific manufacturing methods.

　　冒牌货泛滥成灾　优质品难抵冲击
　　名优药品生产厂呼吁保护
    据新华社北京11月24日电　（记者廖艺、冯瑛冰）“前列康”、“青春宝”、“三九胃泰”等广大消费者耳熟能详的名优药品，目前正受到各种冒牌货的严重威胁。一些国家名优医药产品生产厂家负责人今天在一次座谈会上大声疾呼：为人民群众的生命安全计，为国家医药事业的前途计，迅速完善有关政策法规，制止假冒、仿冒名优药品的行为。
    据了解，近几年，各种假药、仿冒名优药品已泛滥成灾。一些医药生产企业不致力于研制新产品，却借“移植”为名，钻药品生产审批不严的空子，将他人的研究成果窃为己有，甚至盗用他人包装，借以鱼目混珠，给医药市场造成极大混乱。
    浙江兰溪云山制药厂历时10年，耗资数百万元，首创花粉药品“前列康”，创出了名牌。不料“慕名”仿冒者纷至沓来。由于冒牌货质量低劣，患者用后无效，使这家药厂的声誉严重受损，销售出现困难。广州光华制药厂研制的速效伤风胶囊推出后，有100余家企业竞相仿造。广州潘高寿药厂首创的蛇胆川贝液和大同星火制药厂的肺宝三效片，仿冒者均达数十家。天麻丸、王浆制品等的仿冒品也充斥市场。
    仿冒药品质量低劣，没有竞争力，厂家便采用给回扣、送红包等手段推销，冲击了名优产品，乱了市场，坏了风气。
    医药界有关人士指出，冒牌药品危及人民的生命安全。由于名优药品大多技术保密，仿冒厂家弄得到批文却取不来
  “真经”。冒牌药品往往成本高而疗效低，有些还因为配方不合理、制法不科学产生毒副作用。
