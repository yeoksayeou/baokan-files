On the eve of Chinese Premier Li Peng's official friendly visit to Pakistan, the capital Islamabad is filled with a festive atmosphere. The entire nation is preparing for the arrival of the Chinese dignitary. From the airport to the state guesthouse and the new presidential palace, flags are fluttering, and flowers are in full bloom. At intersections and bustling streets, large banners and slogans praising Sino-Pakistani friendship are everywhere: "Welcome, Honorable Guest!" "Sino-Pakistani Friendship Forever!"

Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto personally oversees the preparations for welcoming Premier Li Peng. Recently, Prime Minister Bhutto told the Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, Tian Ding, "I eagerly look forward to meeting Premier Li Peng and his wife again soon in Islamabad. We are actively and seriously preparing for Premier Li Peng and his wife's visit to Pakistan."

Not long ago, Khalid, the Speaker of the Pakistani National Assembly, who visited China and participated in the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the founding of New China, said that Sino-Pakistani friendship is deeply rooted in politics, economics, history, and culture. The two peoples are closely connected, and both governments are developing and deepening this friendship in all aspects. An opposition figure told the reporter, "Although we have differences with the government on policy, there is no disagreement on developing Sino-Pakistani friendship. Premier Li Peng is our common guest."

Mirza, the deputy chairman of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association, who has been advocating for Sino-Pakistani friendship since his student days in the 1950s, said that Sino-Pakistani friendship is as lofty as the Karakoram Mountains, and the friendly exchanges between the two peoples have a long history. Premier Li Peng's visit is of great significance. This is his first visit, and I, on behalf of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association, extend a warm welcome.

The news of Premier Li Peng's visit is well-known in Islamabad. The neighbors of the reporter's residence all know about this grand event and have expressed their congratulations and welcome. A female student excitedly told the reporter that she and her classmates will line up at the airport to welcome the dignitaries and throw flower petals at the Chinese guests. The teachers and students of her school are rehearsing songs and dances, and her classmates will all wear festive attire to welcome Premier Li Peng and his delegation.

The Pakistani media attaches great importance to Premier Li Peng's visit. The deputy director of the Associated Press of Pakistan (the national news agency), Mr. Afzal Khan, said that Sino-Pakistani friendship is a model of international friendship with lasting value. Our two countries both seek peace, development, and prosperity. Our friendship is built on a common foundation and has common goals. In recent days, Pakistani newspapers have extensively reported on the news and comments about Premier Li Peng's impending visit. The "Muslim Daily" wrote on its front page: "Islamabad is enthusiastically preparing to welcome the great friend from the other side of the Karakoram Mountains." "For many years, Sino-Pakistani friendship and close cooperation have been the source of Pakistan's strength. With Premier Li Peng's official friendly visit, the traditional friendship between the two countries will be further developed."

    巴基斯坦首都呈节日气氛  准备热烈欢迎李总理访问
    本报伊斯兰堡11月13日电　记者任毓骏报道：在中国国务院总理李鹏即将对巴基斯坦作正式友好访问前夕，巴基斯坦首都伊斯兰堡呈现一派节日气氛。巴基斯坦举国上下都在为中国贵宾的来临进行准备。从机场到国宾馆和新总统府沿途，彩旗飘扬，鲜花似锦。十字路口、繁华街头，到处可见赞颂中巴友好的大幅标语和横幅：“欢迎您，尊贵的客人！”“巴中友谊万古长青！”
    巴基斯坦总理贝·布托亲自过问迎接李鹏总理来访的准备工作。日前，贝·布托总理对中国驻巴大使田丁说：“我热烈期待着不久在伊斯兰堡与李鹏总理和夫人再次会晤。我们正在为李鹏总理和夫人访巴进行积极而认真的准备。”
    不久前访华并参加新中国诞生40周年大庆的巴基斯坦国民议会议长哈立德先生说，巴中友谊在政治、经济、历史和文化上都是根深蒂固的。两国人民亲密无间，两国政府都在各方面发展和加深这种友谊。一位反对派人士对记者说，尽管我们和政府在政策上有分歧，但在发展巴中友好问题上是没有分歧的。李鹏总理是我们共同的客人。
    从50年代当学生时就为巴中友好而奋斗的巴中友协副主席米尔扎先生说，巴中友谊像喀喇昆仑山一样崇高，两国人民的友好交往源远流长。李鹏总理的访问具有十分重要的意义。这是他第一次来访，我代表巴中友协表示热烈的欢迎。
    李鹏总理来访的消息在伊斯兰堡家喻户晓。记者住地的左邻右舍都知道这一盛事，纷纷向记者表示祝贺并表达他们的欢迎之情。一位女学生兴奋地告诉记者，她和同学们将去机场列队欢迎贵宾，并向中国客人身上撒鲜花瓣。她们学校的师生正抓紧排练歌舞，同学们都将穿上节日盛装前往机场欢迎李鹏总理一行。
    巴基斯坦新闻界对李鹏总理的来访十分重视。巴联社（国家通讯社）副社长阿夫扎尔·汗先生说，巴中友谊堪称世界各国友好关系的楷模，有着永久的价值。我们两国都要求和平、发展和繁荣，我们的友谊建立在共同的基础上，有着共同的目标。近日来，巴基斯坦各报都大量报道李鹏总理即将来访的消息和评论。《穆斯林报》在第一版写道：“伊斯兰堡正在热情地为欢迎来自喀喇昆仑另一侧的伟大朋友而作准备。”“多少年来，巴中友谊和亲密合作成为巴基斯坦力量的源泉，随着李鹏总理的正式友好访问，两国的传统友谊将进一步发展。”
