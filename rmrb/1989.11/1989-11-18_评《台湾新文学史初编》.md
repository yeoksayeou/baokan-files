Title: A Review of "An Initial Compilation of the New Literary History of Taiwan"
Author: Jiang Shui

Edition: 8

Up until now, the mainland has published several monographs on the literary history of Taiwan. Now, Jiangxi People's Publishing House has released "An Initial Compilation of the New Literary History of Taiwan" edited by Gong Zhong and Wang Yisheng. The book, with a length of 310,000 words, outlines a relatively clear development trajectory for the new literature of Taiwan. The book is divided into two parts: the first part, "Taiwan Literature During the Japanese Occupation Period" (1920–1945), introduces the "gestation period," "growth period," and "maturity period" of Taiwan literature; the second part, "Contemporary Taiwan Literature" (1945–1987), introduces the "recovery period" of Taiwan literature and the various development stages after the Kuomintang government moved to Taiwan. The two parts consist of 11 chapters, comprehensively discussing the new literature of Taiwan over the past 70 years.

Reading "An Initial Compilation of the New Literary History of Taiwan" (hereafter referred to as "Initial Compilation"), I believe that the pursuit of individuality is the goal of the authors.

The individuality of "Initial Compilation" is first reflected in the search for a new historical framework. It is not difficult to see that in recent years, the study of Taiwan literature has undergone a transformation, shifting from general introductions of writers and their works to in-depth, comprehensive, and holistic research. The publication of monographs on the literary history of Taiwan is the result of this transformation. In a strict sense, literary history should be distinct from "surveys." The authors of "Initial Compilation" have obviously noticed this fact. They have explicitly placed the search for the framework of history at the forefront and have attempted to trace the historical threads through the analysis of numerous literary phenomena. They do not mechanically divide the content into summaries and writers' works but use history as the thread, emphasizing comprehensive discussion.

It is precisely based on the holistic grasp of Taiwan literature that the authors of "Initial Compilation" have, in their analysis of writers and their works, not isolatedly discussed the works themselves. Instead, they have adopted a three-dimensional, dynamic, and comparative research method. They have placed writers in the context of the historical background for an overall review and have presented the historical background through "point" perspectives. What caught my interest is that the authors have not been confined to the traditional format of discussing important writers in separate sections. Instead, they have dispersed the important works of the same writer into various chapters divided by time. This approach itself indicates a viewpoint: in literary history, everything must be subordinate to "history." In other words, "history" is the commander, "history" is the main thread. Although the approach of breaking down the whole into parts may hinder a comprehensive understanding of a single writer, it is beneficial for grasping the development of literary history.

In fact, regarding the main part of "Initial Compilation," which consists of the analysis of works, it has two references: the writer's own creative process and the development process of Taiwan literature as a whole. A test for those who study literary history is whether they can maintain an organic and close connection between works, the writer's creative process, and the history of literary development. It can be said that the authors of "Initial Compilation" have initially passed this test.

I accept the viewpoint that the system of literary research can be divided into the levels of empirical research, appreciation and criticism, and the study of literary laws. Using the "three levels" viewpoint to measure "Initial Compilation," we are pleased to find that "Initial Compilation" has made a valuable effort in this regard and has greatly advanced the study of the literary history of Taiwan.

    评《台湾新文学史初编》
    江水
    迄今为止，大陆已先后出版了数种研究台湾文学史专著，现在，江西人民出版社又推出了公仲、汪义生编著的《台湾新文学史初编》。该书以31万字的篇幅，为台湾新文学勾勒了一条较为清晰的发展轨迹，全书分上、下两编，上编为
  “日据时期的台湾文学”
  （1920——1945），介绍了台湾文学的“孕育期”、“生长期”、“成熟期”；下编为“当代台湾文学”
  （1945——1987），介绍了台湾文学的“光复期”以及国民党政权迁台后台湾文学的各个发展阶段，两编共11章，全面论述了近70年的台湾新文学。
    读《台湾新文学史初编》（以下简称《初编》）我以为，突出个性是《初编》作者的追求。
    《初编》的个性首先表现在对于新的历史构架的寻求。人们不难看出，近年来的台湾文学研究出现了一个转变，即从对作家作品的一般性评介转向深入的全面的整体的研究，台湾文学史专著的面世正是此种转变的结果。严格意义上的文学史应当是有别于“概观”的。《初编》的作者显然注意到了这一事实，他们明确地将对史的构架的寻求摆在首位，并力图通过大量文学现象的分析梳理出史的线索，他们不是机械地分成概述和作家作品两大块，而是以史为线索，侧重综合论述。
    正是基于对台湾文学的整体把握，《初编》作者在作家作品的分析上，没有孤立地就作品论作品，而是注意采用立体的动态的比较研究方法，既把作家放在历史大背景下进行总体的审视，又以“点”的透视呈现出史的大背景。引起我兴趣的是，作者没有囿于重要作家专节论述的传统格局，而是将同一位作家的重要创作分散到依时间划分的各个章节中去，此种做法本身就表明了一种观点：在文学史中，
  一切都必须服从于“史”，换言之，“史”是统帅，“史”是总纲。化整为零的作法虽有碍于对一位作家的整体了解，却有利于把握文学史发展的脉络。
    实际上，就构成《初编》主要篇幅的作品分析来说，它有两个参照：作家本人的创作历程与整个台湾文学的发展历程。对于文学史的考察者的一个考验在于能否在作品、作家创作历程与文学发展史三者之间保持一种有机的紧密的联系。应当说，《初编》的作者初步经受了这一考验。
    我接受这样一种观点，即将文学研究体系分解为实证性研究层次、鉴赏和批评层次和文学规律的研究层次。以“三个层次”的观点去衡量《初编》，我们欣喜地发现《初编》在这方面作了可贵的努力，并大大推进了对台湾文学史的研究。
