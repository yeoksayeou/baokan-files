At present, while resolutely opposing bourgeois liberalization, we must better flourish socialist literature and arts in China. This requires us to earnestly implement the "two servings" direction and the "hundred flowers and hundred schools of thought" policy, and in the diversified development, strengthen the main melody of literature and arts. This is the consensus reached by the participants at the recent symposium on flourishing literature and arts held in Changsha, jointly organized by the Bureau of Literature and Arts of the Central Propaganda Department and the Propaganda Department of the Hunan Provincial Committee.

The participants believed that art, as a special form of spiritual production, is inherently the most creative. Diversification is an intrinsic requirement of artistic production. Our social life is complex and varied, and the spiritual needs of the people are becoming increasingly diverse. This determines that our literature and arts should also be rich and colorful. Not only in form and style, but also in creative methods, themes, and subjects, all aspects should be diverse. At the same time, our literature and arts should have a distinct main melody. In our era, the main melody of literature and arts should be consistent with the main melody of real life. The main melody we refer to should be formed by works that help people feel and understand that the establishment and development of the socialist system is the objective law of modern Chinese social movements, strongly embody the spirit of the times of unity, inspiration, tenacity, and pioneering in carrying out reform and opening up and modernization construction, and thus inspire people to actively dedicate themselves to the great practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The participants pointed out that in recent years, due to the disruption caused by bourgeois liberalization and other erroneous trends, the main melody that our literature and arts should have has become faint and indistinct, and even lost in a considerable range. Meanwhile, a few truly outstanding works that embody the spirit of the socialist era often face cold shoulders and are belittled. Conversely, some works that deviate from or even completely contradict the spirit of the socialist era have gained increasing popularity. For example, some works that imitate Western modernist literature and art, copy Western modernist views of life and history, and advocate anti-values and decadent sentiments are hyped up as representing the direction of Chinese literature and art development. Many works that vulgarize irrationality and immorality, and merely pursue sensory stimulation are also highly praised and widely circulated in the cultural market. This situation must be seriously changed. Li Zhun, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Literature and Arts of the Central Propaganda Department, emphasized at the meeting: "At present, China's socialist reform and modernization construction are at a critical stage, and the entire socialist cause is facing new severe tests. Our people especially need a contemporary socialist anthem with revolutionary ideals and morality as its core content. Our literature and arts should further diversify, but more importantly, we should raise the main melody full of the spirit of the socialist era, using its unique artistic infectivity to enhance our nation's cohesion and strengthen people's confidence in the socialist cause and their belief in pursuing revolutionary ideals."

The participants believed that to strengthen the main melody in the diversified development of literature and arts, we must strengthen public opinion guidance, clarify a series of theoretical issues confused by bourgeois liberalization, and pay attention to improving the work of literary and artistic awards, vigorously encouraging and supporting outstanding works that truly embody the spirit of the times. We must strengthen and improve the ideological and political work of literary and artistic departments in the new situation, and create better conditions for writers and artists to deeply engage with real life and create excellent works. At the same time, raising the main melody of literature and arts relies on the initiative of writers and artists. Everyone agreed that, in general, actively creating works that reflect the spirit of the times is not an external requirement imposed on writers and artists, but a responsibility that socialist literary and artistic workers should take, and it is in line with the development law of socialist literature and arts. Xia Zanzhong, a member of the Hunan Provincial Committee and the head of the Propaganda Department, said in his speech:

"Literary and artistic workers should closely connect with the reality of reform and opening up and modernization construction, seriously study Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping's series of important statements on literary and artistic issues, and Jiang Zemin's National Day speech, adhere to deepening into life, strive to grasp the spirit of the times, continuously improve their ideological level and artistic accomplishment, and thus create more and better outstanding works that are worthy of this great era."

The participants called for vigorously supporting and advocating the creation of main melody works, and making corresponding adjustments and new regulations in economic policies. The creation of major theme main melody works, especially film and television and theatrical works that require significant human and financial investment, should be supported by the state in terms of economy. Social benefits, as the highest standard of artistic production, should not remain at the level of general calls, but should be seriously addressed in economic policies and cultural regulations.

Comrade He Jingzhi, Deputy Head of the Central Propaganda Department and Acting Minister of Culture, sent a congratulatory message to the symposium. More than 50 writers, critics, and literary and artistic propaganda cadres from Beijing, Hunan, and some other provinces and cities attended the meeting and spoke.

　　中宣部文艺局和湖南省委宣传部联合召开研讨会强调
　　文艺在多样化的发展中强化主旋律
    新华社长沙11月22日电　当前，要在切实反对资产阶级自由化的同时，更好地繁荣我国社会主义文艺，必须认真贯彻“二为”方向和“双百”方针，在多样化的发展中强化文艺的主旋律，这是最近在长沙由中宣部文艺局和湖南省委宣传部联合召开的繁荣文艺研讨会上与会同志的共同认识。
    与会同志认为，艺术作为特殊的精神生产，它的本性是最富于独创性的，多样化是艺术生产的内在要求。我们的社会生活纷繁复杂，人民群众的精神需要也日趋多样，这就决定了我们的文艺也应当是丰富多彩的。不仅形式、风格，而且创作方法、题材、主题等各方面都应当是多种多样的。同时，我们的文艺又应当有自己鲜明的主旋律。在我们这个时代，文艺的主旋律与现实生活的主旋律应当是一致的。我们所说的主旋律，应当是由那些能够帮助人们感受、认识社会主义制度的确立与发展是中国现代社会运动的客观规律，有力地体现团结一致、振奋精神、坚韧不拔、勇于开拓地从事改革开放和现代化建设的时代精神，因而能够激励人们积极献身于建设有中国特色的社会主义的伟大实践的作品所形成的创作主潮。文艺的主旋律越是响亮、鲜明，就越能更好地体现“二为”方向和“双百”方针，使整个文艺创作沿着正确的道路多样化地向前发展。
    与会同志指出，近年来，由于资产阶级自由化思潮和其他错误思潮搞乱了人们的思想，我国文艺应有的这种主旋律不响亮、不鲜明了，甚至在相当大的范围内失落了。而且，连为数不多的真正体现社会主义时代精神的优秀作品也往往遭到冷遇和贬低。与此同时，某些与社会主义时代精神相背离甚至完全背道而驰的作品却越来越走红。比如，一些模仿西方现代主义文艺，照搬西方现代主义的人生观、历史观，宣扬反价值观念和颓废情绪的作品，被某些人吹捧为代表中国文艺发展的方向；不少庸俗地宣扬非理性、非道德，一味追求感官刺激的作品也被捧得很高，并在文化市场上大为风行。这种状况必须认真加以改变。中宣部文艺局副局长李准在会上强调说：“当前，我国的社会主义改革和现代化建设正处于一个关键的阶段，整个社会主义事业正面临着新的严峻考验，我们的人民尤其需要以革命理想和道德为核心内容的当代社会主义的正气歌。我们的文艺要进一步多样化，但更应当高扬起充满社会主义时代精神的主旋律，以特有的艺术感染力去增强我们民族的凝聚力，增强人们对社会主义事业的信心和追求革命理想的信念。”
    与会同志认为，我们的文艺要在多样化的发展中强化主旋律，必须加强舆论引导，澄清被资产阶级自由化搞乱了的一系列思想理论问题，要注意认真改进文艺评奖工作，大力鼓励、扶持真正体现时代精神的优秀作品；要在新形势下加强和改进文艺部门的思想政治工作，要为作家艺术家深入现实生活，创作优秀作品创造更好的条件。同时，高扬文艺的主旋律，要依靠作家艺术家积极性的发挥。大家认为，从总体上说，积极地致力于表现时代精神的作品的创作，并不是从外面强加给作家艺术家的要求，而是社会主义文艺工作者自身应有的责任，是符合社会主义文艺发展规律的要求的。湖南省委常委、宣传部长夏赞忠在讲话中说：
  “文艺工作者应当密切联系改革开放和现代化建设的实际，认真学习马列主义、毛泽东思想，学习邓小平同志关于文艺问题的一系列重要论述和江泽民同志的国庆讲话，坚持深入生活，努力把握时代精神，不断提高自己的思想水平和艺术修养，从而创作出更多更好的无愧于我们这个伟大时代的优秀作品。”
    与会同志呼吁，大力扶持、倡导主旋律创作，还必须从经济政策上做出相应的调整和新的规定。重大题材的主旋律作品的创作，特别是需要较大人力、财力投入的影视和戏剧作品的创作，国家要从经济上给以切实扶持。社会效益作为艺术生产的最高标准，不能停留在一般号召上，应当从经济政策和文化法规上认真加以解决。
    中宣部副部长、文化部代部长贺敬之同志给研讨会发来了贺信。首都、湖南及部分省市的50多位作家评论家和文艺宣传干部出席了会议并发了言。
