Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 24th.

The U.S. federal special court judge Claude Hilton announced today that due to the Justice Department's prohibition on providing relevant secret documents, the court refused to accept the case of another key figure in the Iran-Contra scandal, Joseph Fernandez.

Fernandez was the former head of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency's station in Costa Rica. From 1985 to 1986, he actively assisted former National Security Council staff member Oliver North in diverting funds from the secret sale of U.S. weapons to Iran to support the military activities of the anti-government forces in Nicaragua. After the Iran-Contra scandal was exposed, Fernandez fabricated evidence and obstructed the investigation. Therefore, the special prosecutor investigating the Iran-Contra scandal filed a lawsuit against him, accusing him of four crimes.

On November 22, U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh issued a statement saying that the trial of this case requires the disclosure of some secret documents, which would "seriously harm U.S. national security interests." According to the "Classified Information Procedures Act," the Justice Department has the right to prevent the court from providing relevant secret documents.

Hilton, the judge, announced the court's decision today, saying that the secret documents prohibited by the Attorney General are "crucial" for the defense of the defendant. Without these documents, the trial of this case "cannot be conducted fairly," and therefore the case cannot be accepted.

Regarding the federal special court's decision, the special prosecutor immediately stated that he would appeal. He also accused the Attorney General of "using fabricated secrets to obstruct the trial of the case."

　　美司法部阻挠法庭审理伊朗门有关案件
    新华社华盛顿11月24日电　（记者何大隆）美国联邦特别法庭法官克劳德·希尔顿今天宣布，由于司法部禁止提供有关秘密文件，法庭拒绝受理“伊朗门”丑闻中又一重要人物约瑟夫·费尔南德斯的案件。
    费尔南德斯是美国中央情报局驻哥斯达黎加情报站前站长。曾在1985—1986年间大力协助前国家安全委员会工作人员诺思将美国秘密向伊朗出售军火的款项用于支持尼加拉瓜反政府武装从事军事活动。“伊朗门”丑闻被揭露后，费尔南德斯又制造伪证，阻碍调查。因此调查“伊朗门”丑闻的特别检察官对他提出起诉，指控他犯有4项罪行。
    11月22日，美国司法部长索恩伯格发表声明，说此案件的审理需要透露一些秘密文件，这将“严重损害美国的国家安全利益，根据《秘密情报程序法》，司法部有权阻止向法庭提供有关的秘密文件。
    希尔顿法官今天宣布法庭决定时说，司法部长禁止提供的这些秘密文件对被告辩护来说“至关重要”，没有这些文件，该案的审理“不可能公正进行”，因此无法受理此案。
    对于联邦特别法庭的这一决定，特别检察官立即表示要进行上诉，他还指责司法部长“以虚构的秘密来阻挠案件的审理”。
