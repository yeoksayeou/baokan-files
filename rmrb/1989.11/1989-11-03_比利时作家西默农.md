Belgian writer Georges Simenon passed away on September 4th of this year in Lausanne, Switzerland, at the age of 86.

Simenon was born on February 13, 1903, in Liège. At the age of 16, due to poverty, he dropped out of school and became a reporter for the *Liège Daily*. At 17, he published his first novel, *On the Ark*. In 1922, he moved to Paris to pursue literary creation. Over the next 10 years, he wrote more than 1,000 short stories and 180 popular novels under 24 different pseudonyms. In 1945, he went to the United States and later settled in Switzerland.

Simenon's most famous works are the detective novels featuring Inspector Maigret of the Paris Police Department. In 1930, he published the first book in this series, *The Latvian's Son Pierre*, and by the 1970s, he had written 82 books in the series. Although Simenon had repeatedly attempted to abandon this theme to write other novels, he was unable to do so due to strong reader demand. In 1932, Simenon published his first non-detective novel, *The Mystery of the Pollet Family*, and subsequently wrote over 200 serious novels. His representative works include *The Man Who Watched the Trains Go By* (1938), *The Little Man from Archangel* (1956), and *The Blue Room* (1964). These works mostly expose the cutthroat competition, exploitation, and twisted human nature under the capitalist system, as well as various social maladies, reflecting the suffering people endure in their lives and spirits. Simenon's writing is simple and straightforward, with a rigorous structure. All his novels are concise, yet their narratives are engaging. His superb writing skills have earned him the respect of many great writers around the world. Hemingway often read his novels carefully, and Gide took extensive notes while reading his books. In his later years, Simenon wrote several memoirs. The candidness he displayed in his autobiography *When I Was Old* (1972) surprised many.

Simenon was known for his prolific writing. The *Complete Works of Simenon* published in Switzerland consists of 72 volumes. Many of his works have been adapted for the screen, television, and stage, and have been translated into 57 languages.

    比利时作家乔治·西默农已于今年9月4日在瑞士洛桑逝世，终年86岁。
    西默农1903年2月13日生于列日，16岁时因家贫辍学，进《列日日报》当记者，17岁时发表了第一部小说《在诺亚方舟上》。1922年他来到巴黎从事文学创作，在此后的10年里他用24个笔名写了1000多篇短篇小说和180多部通俗小说。1945年去美国，后来定居瑞士。
    西默农最著名的作品是描写巴黎警察局梅格雷探长的侦探小说。1930年他发表了这套书的第一本《拉脱维亚人皮埃尔》，到70年代为止共写了82部。虽然西默农曾多次想放弃这个题材去写别的小说，但因读者强烈要求，欲罢不能。1932年，西默农发表了第一部非侦探小说《波尔拉利斯之谜》，此后他写了200多部严肃小说，代表作有《瞧着列车过去的人》（1938）、《从天使长那里来的小人》（1956）、《蓝房子》（1964）等，它们大多揭露资本主义制度下的尔虞我诈、弱肉强食、人性的扭曲以及各种社会病态，反映人们生活中和精神上遭受的苦难。西默农的作品朴实简洁，结构严谨，他所有的小说都不长，但叙述娓娓动听。他的高超写作技巧受到世界许多大文豪的敬重。海明威经常认真阅读他的小说，纪德在读他的书时，在书边上写了大量笔记。西默农晚年写了几本回忆录，他在自传《当我老了》（1972）中所表现的坦诚使人大为惊异。
    西默农素以多产著称，在瑞士出版的《西默农全集》多达72卷，不少作品已被搬上银幕、荧屏和舞台，并被译成57种文字。
