The comprehensive audit of finance, taxation, and prices, which began in 1989, has shown initial results in its first month. Various regions have uncovered violations totaling 1.48 billion yuan, of which 750 million yuan should be turned over to the finance department, and 350 million yuan has already been handed in. The audit work has achieved preliminary success.

A responsible official from the State Council's Office for the Comprehensive Audit of Finance, Taxation, and Prices pointed out that this year's comprehensive audit is a major measure to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, to eliminate corruption, and to promote the construction of a clean government. Local party and government leaders at all levels have attached great importance to it, and the vast number of cadres and masses have enthusiastically participated. From the audit situation in the first month, this year's comprehensive audit of finance, taxation, and prices has two obvious characteristics: First, the self-audit work is better than in previous years. Of the violations uncovered, 89% were voluntarily reported by the units themselves, an increase of 21 percentage points compared to the same period last year. Second, the phenomenon of lenient handling has been initially reversed. Some regions that started early have begun to enter the stage of focused audits, and have seriously dealt with the illegal and disciplinary issues that have been uncovered. According to statistics from 13 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, in the first month of the comprehensive audit, 1,200 units and more than 800 individuals have been economically penalized; 12 individuals have been disciplined by the party and the government; and 35 individuals have been transferred to the judicial authorities for investigation.

This responsible official said that the situation of the comprehensive audit work in the previous period is good, but there are still some problems. The main issues are that some enterprises and units have a gambling mentality, do not conduct self-audits seriously, and have the phenomenon of going through the motions; some regions and departments still have the problem of being too lenient in handling illegal and disciplinary issues.

This responsible official emphasized that from now until the end of the year is the critical period for doing a good job in the comprehensive audit work. All regions and departments must immediately dispatch audit teams to conduct focused audits of enterprises and units in phases, and the number of people involved in the focused audits should not be less than in previous years; the scope of the focused audits should not be less than 30%, and regions and departments with fewer large and medium-sized enterprises should have a higher proportion. For all kinds of illegal and disciplinary issues uncovered in the focused audits, they must be strictly dealt with according to the relevant national regulations. It is necessary to resolutely grasp a number of serious and repeated cases, publicly expose and deal with them to educate the masses and deter lawbreakers.

    财税物价大检查初见成效
    一个月查出违纪金额逾14亿
    从现在起进入重点检查阶段
    本报北京11月8日讯  1989年税收、财务、物价大检查开展第一个月，各地已查出各种违纪金额14.8亿元，其中应交财政7.5亿元，已上交3.5亿元，大检查工作取得了初步效果。
    国务院税收财务物价大检查办公室一位负责人指出，今年的大检查是贯彻落实党的十三届四中全会精神，清除腐败，促进廉政建设的一项重大措施，各级党政领导十分重视，广大干部群众踊跃参加。从第一个月的检查情况看，今年的税收、财务、物价大检查有两个明显特点：一是自查工作比往年好。在查出的违纪金额中，由各单位主动自查出来的占89％，比去年头一个月提高21个百分点。二是初步扭转了处理偏宽的现象。一些动手早的地区已开始进入重点检查，对被查出来的违法违纪问题进行了严肃处理。据13个省、自治区、直辖市统计，在头一个月的大检查中，受经济处罚的有1200多个单位、800余人；受党纪政纪处分的有12人；移送司法机关立案侦查的有35人。
    这位负责人说，前一段大检查工作的情况是好的，但还存在一些问题。主要是有些企业和单位存有侥幸心理，自查不认真，有走过场现象；有些地区和部门对违法违纪问题的处理仍有失之过宽的现象。
    这位负责人强调指出，从现在到年底，是搞好大检查工作的关键时期。各地区、各部门都要立即派出检查组，分期分批地对企业和单位开展重点检查工作，投入重点检查的人数不能少于往年；重点检查面不能低于30％，大中型企业较少的地区和部门还应高于这个比例；凡在重点检查中查出的各种违法违纪问题，要坚决按照国家有关的处罚规定从严查处。要下决心抓一批性质严重，屡查屡犯的典型案例，进行公开揭露和处理，以教育群众，震慑违法违纪者。
