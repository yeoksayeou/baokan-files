On July 10, 1989, at 10:10 PM, he fell like a meteor, leaving a brilliant streak in the dark night sky.

On August 25, his former unit, the 19th Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, posthumously awarded him the titles of "Model Communist Party Member" and "Selfless Good Worker."

By the end of October, the China Railway Construction Corporation called on all cadres and workers of its 10 engineering bureaus and other units to learn from him.

He was an ordinary railway worker, only 37 years old, named Pan Congfu.

"His 'axe' always swung forward without hesitation"

Nestled at the foot of Changbai Mountain and along the Taizi River, the eight-pan mountain range obstructed the path of the Tianxi Railway. Pan Congfu's unit, the Second Division, First Section, First Team of the 19th Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, was responsible for excavating a 6,350-meter-long tunnel, one of the longest in the country.

The rock quality of the eight-pan tunnel is fragmented, and the geological layers are variable. After the start of construction, cave-ins occurred frequently, and every step forward required a heavy price...

On July 10 of this year, the team arranged for Pan Congfu to go to Liaoyang on a business trip. As he was packing his luggage to leave, he suddenly heard that there had been another cave-in in the tunnel. He told the team leader, "I have experience dealing with cave-ins. I'll go and handle it first, and then I'll leave."

That night, carpenter foreman Pan Congfu led a few workers into the tunnel. As usual, he took the lead in the most critical and dangerous task of erecting the support timbers. One, two, three... thirteen, all were erected! The people behind him let out a long sigh of relief.

Just as Pan Congfu was about to retreat, he suddenly noticed that one of the support timbers had protruded about two centimeters, causing a nearby timber to loosen. No, this support timber must be reinforced, otherwise, it will affect the quality of the construction! He reached down with both hands, and just as he bent over, a loud roar echoed, and nearly 10 cubic meters of rock collapsed from above his head. Pan Congfu, the hero who had led the team to overcome more than 260 cave-ins in the tunnel, sacrificed his precious life.

Since joining the workforce in 1972, Pan Congfu had worked tirelessly like an old yellow cow. Carrying logs, while others carried one, he carried two; pushing cement, while others pushed three bags, he pushed five or six... In early 1987, the tunnel frequently experienced cave-ins, and if the entrance was not promptly sealed with concrete, construction would be difficult. The first step in sealing the entrance is to erect the formwork. The leadership considered that the team lacked technical skills and manpower, and hired workers from another unit for 4,000 yuan to do the job. However, the other party felt that the work was both arduous and dangerous, and the pay was too low, so they left without doing the job.

Pan Congfu, known as "Pan the Axe," approached the leadership and pounded his chest, saying, "I'll take on this job!" The leadership told him that due to the frequent cave-ins in the tunnel, the progress was slow, and the team members could only receive basic wages. However, Pan Congfu's enthusiasm did not wane. He led eight carpenters to work continuously for four days and nights in the tunnel, despite the constant falling of debris, and finally completed the task ahead of schedule. When he returned to the dormitory with his tired body, he did not even take off his work clothes covered in mud and water, and collapsed onto the bed, falling into a deep sleep...

A carpenter who had worked closely with Pan Congfu sighed, "No matter what time it is, his 'axe' always swings forward without hesitation, never retreating."

In critical moments, true heroes emerge. Every time there was a danger in the tunnel, if one person could handle it, Pan Congfu would take it on; if it required several people, he would always be at the forefront. In early June of this year, the tunnel collapsed again. Section Chief Song Fucheng came to the front to direct the rescue operation. Seeing this, Pan Congfu pulled Song Fucheng to the back and said, "Let me direct. If I die, it's okay, but you can't die. The entire section of over 2,000 people will be looking to you for food!"

Pan Congfu often dealt with death, and his wife was always worried about him. Once, the whole family was having lunch together. His wife stared at her husband, tears in her eyes, and said, "Congfu, I beg you, next time there's a cave-in, don't rush to the front." Pan Congfu replied, "If you don't rush to the front, if he doesn't rush to the front, will the work be done? Besides, I am a party member. In critical moments, who else should rush to the front if not the party member?"

"His heart is entirely on the railway"

Pan Congfu was born in Dujiangyan City, Sichuan Province. In late 1972, he joined the People's Liberation Army Railway Engineering Corps. In 1984, he was transferred with his unit and became a railway worker. Most of his fellow soldiers and hometown friends who joined the army with him had retired, been transferred, or reassigned back home, but he did not waver.

In 1985, his brother, who worked as a cadre in his hometown, helped him find a good job there. At that time, Pan Congfu was leading more than ten young workers in the construction of station buildings and windows at stations such as Tuli Mao Du and Huatu Gula on the Tong-Ho Railway in Daxinganling. The place was so cold that "there is one windstorm a year, from spring to winter." At the coldest times, the temperature dropped to minus 40 degrees. When his fellow workers learned about his brother's letter, they all congratulated him, "Now you can leave this miserable place and go back to enjoy life in the land of fish and rice." However, Pan Congfu thought, if I leave, who will do the carpentry work for these few stations? If the station buildings are not completed on time, the railway will be delayed! He replied to his brother, "Let's consider this issue in a couple of years."

Two years passed in the blink of an eye. In the spring of 1987, Pan Congfu returned to his hometown for a family visit during the Spring Festival. His wife happily told him that his brother had found him a job in the city that was easy and in a quiet environment, and the transfer documents had been processed. Pan Congfu explained to his wife, "It's not the right time now. The team is currently digging a tunnel, and there is only one carpentry team to erect the formwork. I am the team leader and the only party member in the carpentry team. If I leave now, isn't that deserting in the face of the enemy?" He stayed with the team again.

Pan Congfu's wife, Zhang Guoqin, suffers from anemia and has to take care of the children and work in the fields in their hometown, collapsing several times from exhaustion. Pan Congfu felt that he owed his family an "emotional debt." Every time he visited home, he would insist that his wife rest more and take on all the household chores himself. During the busy farming season, if there was moonlight at night, he would also go to the fields to work, hoping to make up for his "mistakes" by using one day as two. However, when the family's busyness conflicted with the team's busyness, his heart always tilted towards the latter. He had been working for 17 years but had only visited home fewer than 10 times, and 4 of those times he returned to the team early.

Zhang Guoqin sighed, "His heart is entirely on the railway."

Zhang Guoqin will never forget this incident. Last May Day, she brought her son Pan Bing to the construction site to celebrate the holiday. Unfortunately, Pan Bing was hit by a car near the highway next to the construction site, resulting in a comminuted fracture of his left thigh. To avoid delaying the construction, Pan Congfu sent his son to a hospital not far from the construction site for treatment. He only stayed with his son in the hospital for 3 days before rushing back to the construction site.

"He is poor, yet he is rich"

Pan Congfu left behind an empty home.

In front of the portrait placed in the room, there were no fresh flowers or incense, only two cups of Liaoning's famous liquor "Fengcheng Laojiao" and a box of "Shilin" brand cigarettes.

His wife, Zhang Guoqin, told everyone in a choked voice, "Congfu loved to drink and smoke, but he always hesitated to buy them. The cigarettes he occasionally bought were only worth a few jiao per pack; the liquor he bought was only a little over one yuan per bottle. Now that he's gone, let him drink a good liquor and smoke a good cigarette..."

She choked up, and everyone's eyes moistened.

In the two rooms, apart from a broken wooden box, a high-low cabinet, a double bed, and pots and pans, as well as simple bedding, there was nothing else.

In theory, this sixth-level carpenter who had trained over 60 apprentices and had been working tirelessly in the wilderness for many years should have been earning three or four hundred yuan a month, which would not be considered much. However, due to the frequent cave-ins in the eight-pan tunnel that his team was responsible for, the progress was slow, and the benefits were low. He could only earn over a hundred yuan a month, and sometimes his monthly income was only sixty or seventy yuan. Yet, he had to support a family of four.

Pan Congfu had been working for 17 years, and all his outer clothes were issued military uniforms and railway uniforms; he had never bought a single piece of clothing himself. In May of this year, his wife saw him wearing yellow rubber boots all day and bought him a pair of leather sandals for over 30 yuan. When she handed them to her husband to try on, Pan Congfu kept saying, "Too expensive, too expensive." Until his death, he had not worn them.

Pan Congfu was poor, but he never asked the state for a single penny in subsidies. In the past two years, the team had offered him relief twice, but he had declined both times.

Pan Congfu was poor, but he was so generous. He heard that there was a flood in a certain place and took the lead in donating money to the disaster area. Every time he returned to his hometown to visit his family, he brought back bacon and sausages, and he never failed to share them with his fellow workers.

Pan Congfu was poor, but he was clear about public and private matters. As a carpenter for 17 years, he had handled over 2,500 cubic meters of timber, much of which was high-quality material for making furniture, but he did not take a single piece. Last March, his family moved to Liaoyang and lived in a flat. Due to the humidity nearby, there were many mosquitoes and flies in the summer, and the neighbors had all asked people to make mosquito nets, but the home of this carpentry team leader had not installed a mosquito net. His wife and children had urged him several times, but he always said, "Let's do it later." However, until his death, two summers had almost passed, and he had not made the mosquito net...

After Pan Congfu's death, people sorted through his belongings and saw that in the broken wooden box that had accompanied him on his travels, apart from a few patched clothes, there were also certificates of honor and glowing commendation medals. They recorded: Pan Congfu had been awarded three times, received seven awards, and was evaluated as an "Advanced Producer," "Civilized Worker Model," "Excellent Communist Party Member," and "Active Learner of Lei Feng" 14 times!

The party committee secretary of the Second Division of the 19th Engineering Bureau, Zhong Zhenbang, sighed, "He is poor, yet he is rich."

    痴心赤胆
    ——记铁道部19工程局工人潘从富
    王开忠　樊景文　朱斌
    1989年7月10日22时10分，他像一颗流星陨落了，在漆黑的夜空划出一道耀眼的闪光。
    8月25日，他生前所在单位铁道部19工程局授予他“模范共产党员”和“无私奉献的好工人”光荣称号。
    10月底，中国铁道建筑总公司号召所属10个工程局及其他单位的全体干部职工向他学习。
    他，是位普通的铁路职工，年仅37岁，名叫潘从富。
    “他这把‘斧子’总是没命地朝前砍，从不往后缩”
    坐落在长白山麓、太子河畔的八盘岭，像一头巨兽阻挡着田溪铁路的去路。潘从富所在的铁道部19工程局二处一段一队，承担着这里全国屈指可数的6350米长隧道的掘进任务。
    八盘岭隧道石质破碎，地层多变，开工以后，塌方不断，每前进一步，都要付出沉重的代价……
    今年7月10日，队里安排潘从富到辽阳出差。当他整理行李准备动身时，忽然听说隧道里又发生塌方。他对队长说：“我对付塌方有经验，等处理完塌方再走吧。”
    入夜，木工班长潘从富带着几名工人进洞了。他又像往常一样，抢在别人的前头，承担了最关键、最危险的立支撑木任务，1根、2根、3根……13根，全部立起来了！后边的人们长长地吁出了一口气。
    潘从富刚要向后撤出，忽然发现有一根支撑木长出了两厘米左右，将附近的一根支撑木顶松动了。不行，这根支撑木不加固好，会影响施工质量！他双手向下伸去，就在他刚刚弯腰时，“轰隆”一声巨响，近10立方米岩石从他头顶塌了下来。潘从富，这位在隧道中带头战胜过260多次塌方的英雄，献出了宝贵的生命。
    潘从富1972年参加工作后，像一头老黄牛，一直不知疲倦地工作。运木头，别人扛一根，他扛两根；推水泥，别人推三袋，他推五六袋……1987年初，隧道经常发生塌方，如不及时用混凝土灌注好洞门，就难以施工。灌注洞门先要立模板。领导上考虑到队里技术不足，人力不够，用4000元钱聘请外单位木工来干。可对方认为这工作既艰苦又危险，给钱太少，甩手走了。
    被人称为“潘大斧子”的潘从富找到领导拍着胸口说：“这活，我包了！”领导告诉他，由于隧道塌方无进度，本队职工干，每人只能拿基本工资。可潘从富干劲不减，带领8名木工冒着不断下落的碎石，在洞里连续奋战了4天4夜，终于提前完成了任务。当他拖着疲倦的身体回到宿舍时，连沾满泥水的工作服都未脱，一头倒在床上就昏睡了……
    一位和潘从富朝夕相处的木工感慨地说：“不管什么时候，他这把‘斧子’总是没命地朝前砍，从不往后缩。”
    生死关头，最显英雄本色。每次在洞内排险，一个人能干的，潘从富就包下来；需要几个人干的，他总是冲在前边。今年6月初，隧道又塌方了，处长宋福成来到最前边指挥抢险。潘从富见后，将宋福成拉到后边说：“还是我来指挥。我死了不要紧，你可不能死呀，全处2000多张嘴找你要饭吃哩！”
    潘从富和“死神”打交道，妻子常为他担心。一次，全家人一起吃午饭。妻子呆呆地望着丈夫，含着眼泪说：“从富，我求你以后再遇到塌方别冲在前头了。”潘从富回答说：“你不往前冲，他不往前冲，还施工不施工？再说，我是党员，关键时刻党员不冲谁冲？”
      “他的心，全操在铁路上”
    潘从富出生在四川都江堰市，1972年底参加了人民解放军铁道兵部队。1984年，他随部队集体转业，成为一名铁路职工。同他一起入伍的同乡战友绝大多数都退伍、转业、调动回去了，他没有半点动摇。
    1985年，他在家乡当干部的哥哥帮他在家乡联系了一个不错的工作。当时，潘从富正带领十多名青年工人，在位于大兴安岭的通霍铁路吐列毛都、花吐古拉等车站担负站房门窗的制作和安装任务。那地方“一年一场风，从春刮到冬”。最冷时，气温达零下40多度。工友们得知潘从富哥哥的来信后，都向他祝贺：“这下你可要离开这个苦地方，回到鱼米之乡享福去了。”可潘从富心想，自己一走，这几个车站的木工活咋办？不能按期建好站房，就会误了铁路交付使用的日期呀！他给哥哥回信说：“过两年再考虑这个问题吧。”
    一晃两年过去了。1987年春节，潘从富探亲回到家乡。妻子高兴地告诉他，哥哥又为他在市里联系了一个工作轻松、环境幽静的国营单位，而且办好了商调函。潘从富对妻子解释说：“现在还不行。队里正在打隧道，立模板的只有一个木工班，自己是班长，又是木工中唯一的党员，这时离开，那不是临阵脱逃吗？”他再次留队了。
    潘从富的妻子张国芹患贫血病，在家乡既要拖儿带女，又要下地干活，几次累倒。潘从富感到欠了亲人一笔“感情债”。每次探家，他都逼着妻子多休息，自己包下全部家务。遇到农忙时，白天忙不过来，只要夜里有月光，他也下地去干活，恨不得一天当成两天用，来弥补一下自己的“过失”。可是，当家里忙和队里忙“打架”时，他心中的天平总是倾向后者。他参加工作17年，探亲不到10次，其中有4次提前归队。
    妻子张国芹叹息道：“他的心，全操在铁路上了。”
    张国芹忘不了这件事。去年“五一”节，她带着儿子潘兵来到工地过节。不幸，儿子潘兵在工地附近的公路旁，被一辆汽车撞倒，造成左大腿粉碎性骨折。为了不耽误施工，潘从富把儿子送进离工地不远的一家医院治疗。他只陪儿子在医院住了3天，就匆匆赶回工地。
      “他很穷，可又很富”
    潘从富离去了，留下了一个空荡荡的家。
    摆放在屋里的遗像前，没有鲜花，没有香火，只有两杯辽宁名酒“凤城老窖”和一盒“石林”牌香烟。
    他妻子张国芹用哭哑的声音告诉人们：“从富爱喝酒，也爱抽烟，可他平时总舍不得买。偶尔买的烟，都是二三毛钱一包的；买的酒，都是一块出头一瓶的。现在走了，就让他喝两口好酒，抽几支好烟吧……”
    她哽咽了，在场的人眼睛也都湿润了。
    两间屋内，除了一只破木箱、一个高低柜、一张双人床和锅碗瓢盆以及简陋的铺盖外，别无所有。
    按说，这位培养了60多名徒弟、长年奔波在塞外超时间干着超强度体力活的6级木工，每月拿上三四百元也不算多。可由于队里担负施工的八盘岭隧道经常塌方，进度缓慢，效益很低，他多数月份只能拿100多元的工资，有时，月收入只有六七十元。而他却要负担4口之家的生活。
    潘从富参加工作17年，穿的外衣全是发的军装和路服，自己没买过一件。今年5月，妻子见他整天穿着黄胶鞋，为他买了一双30多元钱的皮凉鞋。当她拿给丈夫试穿时，潘从富不住地说：“太贵了，太贵了。”直到牺牲，他都没舍得穿。
    潘从富虽穷，却不愿伸手向国家要一分钱补助。近两年来，队里两次要给他救济他都谢绝了。
    潘从富虽穷，却是那样慷慨大方。他听说有个地方发水灾，带头向灾区捐款。他每次回老家探亲，带来腊肉、香肠，没有一回不是和工友们分着吃。
    潘从富虽穷，却公私分明。他当木工17年，经手的木料多达2500多立方米，许多是做家具的上等料，他一根未拿。去年3月，他家迁到辽阳，住进平房。由于附近潮湿，夏天蚊蝇多，左邻右舍都请人做了纱门，而他这个木工班长的家却一直没有装上纱门。妻子儿女催了几次，他都讲“等以后再说。”可是直到牺牲，两个夏天快过去了，他也没有把纱门做好……
    潘从富去世后，人们清理他的遗物，看到那只伴随他东奔西走的破木箱里，除了几件补了又补的衣服外，还有一张张荣誉证书和一个个闪光的立功奖章。它们记载着：潘从富3次立功，7次受奖，14次被评为“先进生产者”、“文明职工标兵”、“优秀共产党员”和“学习雷锋积极分子”！
    19工程局二处党委书记钟振帮感慨地说：“他很穷，可又很富。”
