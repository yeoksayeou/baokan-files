Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 1st.

The PLA's Armed Police Force took over the duty at Tiananmen Square at midnight today. The Beijing Municipal Government and the Martial Law Command Headquarters issued their 17th notice, stating that these measures are being taken because the situation in the capital has become increasingly stable and social order has basically returned to normal. Previously, the martial law troops had already withdrawn from all checkpoints at overpasses and intersections. Lieutenant General Fan Zhiren of the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Armed Police Force led his troops to take over the duty. Since the clearing of the square on June 4th, the martial law troops have been on duty at Tiananmen Square for over four months without any unusual incidents, and have received nearly 3 million tourists.

    天安门广场从今天起由武警部队接替执勤
    新华社北京11月1日凌晨零时30分电　今天凌晨零时，戒严部队在天安门广场的执勤岗哨由武警部队接替。北京市政府、戒严部队指挥部第17号通告指出，采取这些措施，是因为首都的形势日趋稳定，社会秩序已基本恢复正常。此前，进京戒严部队在立交桥和路口的执勤岗哨已全部撤离。中国人民武装警察部队总部副司令范志伦少将率部接岗。从6月4日清场以后，戒严部队在天安门广场执勤已4个多月，没出现异常情况，并接待了近300万游客。
