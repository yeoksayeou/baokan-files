Edition: 5

A year ago, Mou Zhinan was elected as the president of the People's Court of Qixia County, Shandong Province. His relatives, friends, and fellow villagers all thought that they now had a "backer" for legal disputes, and many brought litigants and gifts to his home. However, no one got anything from him. Soon, a phrase spread among his hometown and relatives: "Mou Zhinan became the president, but he doesn't help with requests anymore."

One of his cousins didn't believe it. Recently, he brought his sister, who had a dispute over an apple orchard with a neighbor, along with large and small packages of "local specialties" to his home. Upon seeing him, he said, "I heard from the people in our village that you don't handle things anymore since you became the president. Today, for the sake of our many years of brotherhood, you must help me plead the case." Mou Zhinan's face turned stern, and he sincerely said, "It's not that I'm heartless, but the law is heartless. If you have a case, go to the court to argue it. You don't need me to plead for you, and it will be handled fairly. We have a brotherly relationship, but it cannot exceed the law." The man's attempt to provoke him failed, and he had no choice but to go to the court to seek a legal judgment.

In September this year, a nephew of a vice president of the court, along with another young man, stole sand gold worth 11,000 yuan from a farmer in their village. The two surrendered to the authorities shortly after the crime and returned the stolen goods in full. After the case was transferred to the court, someone said to Mou Zhinan, "The criminals surrendered voluntarily, their attitude is good, and they are first-time offenders. Shouldn't we waive criminal punishment? Besides, it involves the relative of a vice president. Sentencing them would not be good for our court." Mou Zhinan became angry upon hearing the plea and severely criticized the person. He then told the case handlers, "No matter who it is, they must be punished according to the law."

He stood firm against the pleading winds from all directions, convened a judicial committee meeting, and sentenced the two criminals to three years in prison with a four-year reprieve. He also publicly announced the verdict at a mass sentencing meeting.

In recent years, economic cases have increased, and people often "blow wind" to him: "When handling economic cases, you should find some benefits for our county." However, he said, "The law protects the interests of the entire nation, not just one side. Our power is to act according to the law." A textile parts factory in Jiangxi Province supplied parts worth 7,600 yuan to a township-owned weaving factory in Qixia County. However, the weaving factory had no money to pay and delayed for a year and a half. In August this year, the Jiangxi factory sued at the Qixia Court. Upon hearing this, the factory director and local leaders immediately found Mou, asking him to delay the case for a few months, but he refused on the spot. He immediately arranged for the case to be "handled as quickly as possible," and a complex economic dispute case was concluded in just 18 days. The weaving factory paid the remaining amount in cloth, making the other party very satisfied.

Mou Zhinan had been a township party committee secretary for many years and had many acquaintances and friends. However, in the year and a half since he became the president, he offended many people. Several relatives no longer associated with him, and friends who were once very close rarely visited, knowing that he handled cases according to the law and that pleading would be useless. They also did not want to see him get angry when seeing gifts.

On Mou Zhinan's scale of justice, everything is balanced, and he has been commended by the Intermediate People's Court of Yantai City and the High People's Court of Shandong Province.

　　“求不动”的牟志南
　　牟文民　李克拥
    一年前，牟志南被选举为山东省栖霞县法院院长，他的亲戚、朋友、老乡都觉得从此打官司有了“靠山”，不少人领着案件当事人、带着礼物来到他家。可是，谁也没有从他那里讨到什么。很快，在他的家乡、亲朋中就传开一句话：“牟志南当院长后，求不动了”。
    他的一个姑舅弟兄不信，前不久领着与邻居闹果园纠纷的妹妹，带着大包小包的“土特产”来到他家，见面就说：“听咱前后村人说，你当院长后，不办事了。今天看在咱兄弟多年的交情上，无论如何也要帮俺讲讲情”。牟志南把脸一板，诚恳地说：“不是我无情，而是法律无情，你有理可到法庭上说，不用我讲情也会公正处理。咱们兄弟有感情，但不能超越法律。”那人的“激将法”搬不动牟志南，无奈，只好到法庭凭法律的评判。
    今年9月，一位副院长的侄子，伙同另一青年盗窃了本村一户农民淘的沙金，价值达11000元，二人作案后不久又在法律威慑下主动投案，如数交回赃物。案子转到法院后，有人对牟志南说：案犯主动投案，态度很好，又是初犯，免于刑事处分吧。再说，又涉及副院长的亲属，判刑对咱法院也不光彩。”牟志南一听说情的就火了，把对方狠狠地批评了一通，又对办案人员说：“不管是谁，依法定罪”。
    他顶着上下左右说情风，主持召开了审判委员会，对2名案犯判刑3年缓期4年，还在万人宣判大会上公开宣判。
    这几年，经济案件多起来，有人经常给他“吹风”：“办经济案件，要多给本县找点好处。”可他却说：“法律是保护全国人民利益的，不是只保护哪一方利益的。我们的权力是依法办事。”江西省一家纺织配件厂给栖霞县一家乡办织布厂，提供纺机零件价值达7600元。可是这家织布厂无钱付给，拖了1年半。今年8月，江西厂家到栖霞法院起诉，织布厂得知后，厂长和乡里领导立即找到牟院长，要他把案子拖几个月，被他当场拒绝。他还立即安排人员“尽快审理”，一起复杂的经济纠纷案仅用了18天就审结，织布厂付款不足部分，用布顶替，使对方非常满意。
    牟志南当过多年乡镇党委书记，有很多熟人朋友，可他当院长一年半，就得罪了不少人，几门亲戚不再来往，过去交往甚密的朋友也很少登门，都知道他办案依法，找也没用，更不愿看他见到礼物时大发脾气。
    在牟志南执法的天平上，事事保持平衡，受到了烟台市中级人民法院和山东省高级人民法院的通报表彰。
