Title: Two Perspectives on "Crying Hard"

Edition: 5

“Running a business is really tough these days!” If you encounter ten factory directors today, nine out of ten will likely say this. Rising prices of raw materials, energy shortages, and tight funds have already made directors anxious. Recently, the market has also become sluggish, like a leaky boat encountering a headwind. No wonder the cries of hardship from the business sector are unending.

However, in a chance encounter, the author discerned a different meaning from the chorus of cries. The other day, a director of a state-owned cotton mill visited. When the author asked about the factory's current production situation, the director displayed a calm demeanor. He listed the specific measures they had taken. These measures were all implemented and effective, with production value and benefits not only not decreasing but actually increasing compared to last year. Despite this, the director still exclaimed, “It’s tough!”

Even though they had found the key to overcoming difficulties, they still joined in the cries of hardship. Why is this? The reason is simple: everyone else is crying out, and if you don’t, you might be at a disadvantage. This mindset makes me think of two points: first, among the many who cry out in hardship, some have, through their own efforts, found that the difficulties are not as severe as they claim, and many have already or partially overcome them; second, in the process of overcoming difficulties, businesses hope that the higher authorities will support them fairly, without favoring one over the other, and certainly not “spoiling the child who cries the loudest.”

The first point is not to underestimate the difficulties businesses currently face, but to say that as long as businesses are willing to put in the effort and tap into their own potential, many difficulties can be overcome. Take the cotton mill mentioned earlier, for example. Shortages of raw materials, tight funds, and poor sales are common problems in the cotton industry, and this factory is no exception. They went out of the factory gates and, through various channels, developed processing with supplied materials, solving the problem of raw material shortages and greatly saving working capital. They decisively adjusted their product structure to adapt to market changes. They focused on technological renovation and progress, improving their ability to “eat coarse grains” on one hand, and on the other, improving product quality and increasing exports.

It is undeniable that some difficulties are hard to overcome with the business’s own strength. However, businesses can, through their own efforts, alleviate difficulties or create good conditions for solving them. Our directors cannot expect to always sail with the wind. If they can pass this test and enhance the business’s ability to row against the current, that would not be a bad thing. From a macro perspective, the current difficulties in our national economy, no matter how you look at it, ultimately have to be solved by businesses improving their efficiency. There is no other way.

Every business wants more support and better treatment from the higher authorities, and this desire is understandable. However, from a macro perspective, it is impossible to achieve. Therefore, the only way to reconcile this contradiction is fairness. In the process of rectification and adjustment, we need to implement preferential policies for certain industries to provide support, and implement restrictive policies for certain industries to limit them. Who should be supported and how should be decided based on the overall situation and industrial policies, without any subjective arbitrariness. Being too soft-hearted or favoring relatives over strangers will only encourage a mindset of reliance and weaken the business’s fighting spirit. If we support backward or unsupportable businesses, it will make rectification and adjustment difficult to achieve the expected goals.

Having difficulties, crying out is fine. But it is better to focus more on tapping into one's own potential. Those who hear the cries of hardship should have a global perspective and not be swayed by whose voice is louder. In that case, the author believes that the cries of hardship may gradually decrease, and what will increase is the real actions of overcoming difficulties.

### “喊难”两说
辛言

    “喊难”两说
     辛言
    “如今办企业真难！”眼下，如果你碰到十位厂长，恐怕有九位厂长会这样说。原材料涨价，能源短缺，资金紧张，已经令厂长们焦头烂额。近来又出现了市场疲软，恰似“漏船偏遇顶头风”，难怪企业界喊难之声不绝于耳了。
    然而，在一次偶然的机会中，笔者从一片喊难声中品出了一种别样的意味。前几天，一位国营棉纺厂的厂长来访。当笔者问到厂里目前的生产情况时，这位厂长颇有处变不惊的大将风度。他一一历数了他们采取的具体措施。这些措施件件有着落，条条见效果，产值、效益非但没有下降，反而比去年有所增长，虽则如此，这位厂长临了还是喊了声：“难啊！”
    明明已经找到了克服困难的钥匙，却依然跟着喊难。为什么这样？道理很简单，人人都在喊，自己不喊，怕吃亏。这种心态的存在，使我想到两点：一，在众多的喊难者中，有些由于自己的努力，困难并不像他喊的那样严重，其中不少已经或者部分得到克服；二、在克服困难的过程中，企业希望上级主管部门对企业的支持要尽可能公平，不要厚此薄彼，更不能“会哭的孩子多吃奶”。
    这里所说的第一条，并不是要低估企业当前面临的困难，而是说只要企业肯努力，下气力挖掘自身的潜力，有不少困难是可以克服的。就拿前面提到的那个棉纺厂来说吧，原料短缺、资金紧张，销路不畅是目前棉纺行业普遍遇到的难题，这家厂子也不例外。他们走出厂门，通过各种渠道发展来料加工，既解决了原料短缺的困难，也大大节约了流动资金。他们果断调整产品结构，适应了市场的变化。他们狠抓技术改造和技术进步，一方面提高了“吃粗粮”的本领，另一方面提高了产品档次，增加了出口。
    毋庸讳言，有些困难单靠企业自身的力量是难以克服的。但是，企业可以通过自己的努力，缓解困难，或为解决困难创造良好的条件。我们的厂长，不能指望总是在顺风顺水中行船。如果通过这次考验，能够增强企业逆水行舟的本事，那未尝不是一件好事。从全局来说，目前我们国民经济的困难，靠来靠去，最终还是要靠企业提高效益来解决，舍此别无它途。
    每个企业，都想从上级主管部门那里得到更多的支持，更优惠的待遇，这种愿望应该说是正常的。但是从总体上说，又是不可能实现的。因此，协调这一矛盾的唯一做法，只能是公平。在治理整顿中，我们有必要对某些行业实行倾斜政策，加以扶持；对某些行业实行紧缩政策，加以限制。应该给谁以什么样的支持，要服从大局，要执行产业政策，而不能有半点主观随意性。耳根太软，或者厚亲薄疏，都会助长等靠要的思想，涣散企业的斗志。如果我们支持的是落后的或不该支持的企业，更会使治理整理难以达到预期的目标。
    有了难处，喊喊也无妨。但不如把更多的目光投在自身的挖潜上。听到喊难的人全局在胸，不以谁人的声高为动。那么，笔者以为，喊难之声或许会日渐减少，而增加的，却是实实在在的克服困难的行动。
