Ma Wulin, an old worker from the Lajun Temple Oilfield Comprehensive Oil Production Team 3 in Yumen Oilfield, is known as "a well in the Qilian Mountains." Since 1982, he has used an iron drill and his two hands to collect the scattered crude oil from hundreds of wells in the team after maintenance, one drop at a time, digging ditches and building dams to recover it. To collect oil, he wandered year after year in the mountains, valleys, gullies, and ravines. By April 1987, when he retired, he had recovered over 6,000 tons of crude oil, averaging more than 3 tons per day, equivalent to the output of one well. On the eve of his retirement, he was proudly admitted to the Chinese Communist Party.

After retirement, he voluntarily went to the team's party branch and said, "My work years are over, but my party years are just beginning. Let me continue to work!" Two years after retirement, he recovered an additional 3,665 tons of spilled crude oil. The gloves he used to collect oil were mostly made from old, used gloves that he washed and repaired, never asking the leaders for new ones.

    连山下一口“井”
    马武林，玉门油田老君庙油矿综合采油三队老工人，被誉为“祁连山下一口‘井’”。从1982年起，他靠一把铁铣两只手，把全队上百口油井修井后散落的原油一点一滴、挖沟拦坝回收起来。为收油，他成年累月地在山山洼洼沟沟坎坎里转悠，到1987年4月退休，回收原油达6000余吨，平均每天3吨多，相当于一口井的产量，退休前夕光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    退休后，他主动找到队党支部说：“工龄我是到头了，可党龄才开始，让我继续干吧！”退休两年，他又回收落地原油3665吨。他收油戴的手套中很大一部分利用别人用过的旧手套，洗洗补补再用，从来没有为此向领导张口要新的。
