The Beijing Municipal Government Party Work Conference, held today, emphasized that effectively managing the daily affairs of party members is a key aspect of strengthening party building within government agencies.

The conference pointed out that currently, all agencies must strengthen the education of party members and strive to improve their political qualities. Education for party members should include basic party theory, basic party knowledge, and education on patriotism, collectivism, self-reliance, and hard work. Various forms such as party schools, training classes, and lectures should be used to regularly educate party members. Each agency should provide at least 7 days of concentrated training for party members annually.

The conference believed that conducting ideological and political work is an important part of managing party members. The ideological and political work in agencies should highlight the unique characteristics of government work. The current focus of ideological and political work is to clearly and confidently educate on upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, ensuring that the Four Cardinal Principles are deeply ingrained and serve as the political guideline and ideological driving force for all work.

The conference stressed that from now on, Beijing Municipal Government agencies should conduct an annual evaluation of party members. Through these evaluations, a system for assessing and managing party members should be established, ensuring that there are records for daily activities, quarterly assessments, semi-annual analyses, and annual evaluations.

Additionally, supervision and anti-corruption efforts must be strengthened to promote clean governance in agencies. Each agency should regularly supervise and inspect party members' participation in party activities, fulfillment of party duties, and clean governance. Besides daily supervision, there should be two inspections per year, aligning with democratic life meetings, and the results should be made public. Good performance should be commended, and poor performance should be criticized. The focus of supervision should be on party leader cadres.

At this conference, the Beijing Municipal Government Party Committee also proposed that party cadres should resume the practice of collective labor. Each party cadre should engage in at least 15 days of labor annually, and a labor record book should be established. The labor situation of bureau-level leaders should be inspected every half year, and the results should be made public.

The conference pointed out that strengthening the construction of grassroots party organizations is the organizational guarantee for managing party members. Currently, the number and quality of full-time party affairs cadres in agencies do not meet the needs of strengthening party work. A group of comrades with good political qualities and some party work experience should be selected and appointed to strengthen the party work team in agencies. A complete party work mechanism should be established. Directly affiliated general branches and branches should also have full-time or part-time party workers. The agency party committee should list the strengthening of branch construction as an important agenda item, regularly analyze and study it, conduct a comprehensive inspection and summary of branch work annually, and propose specific measures to improve and strengthen branch construction.

    北京市国家机关党的工作会议强调
    切实做好党员日常管理工作  加强监督促进机关廉政建设
    据新华社北京11月7日电  （通讯员赵大和、富成兰、记者黄智敏）今天召开的北京市国家机关党的工作会议强调，切实搞好党员的日常管理工作，是加强机关党的建设的一个关键。
    会议指出，当前各机关要切实加强党员教育，努力提高党员的政治素质。党员的日常教育，包括对党员进行党的基本理论教育；党的基本知识的教育；爱国主义、集体主义、自力更生、艰苦奋斗的教育。要采取党员进党校、办轮训班、组织讲座等形式，经常地对党员进行教育。各机关每年对党员的集中培训不少于7天。
    会议认为，做好思想政治工作，是加强党员管理的一个重要内容。机关的思想政治工作要突出机关的特点。当前思想政治工作重点就是要旗帜鲜明、理直气壮地进行坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育，使四项基本原则深入人心，成为指导一切工作的政治准则，推动一切工作的思想动力。
    会议强调，今后北京市机关每年都要进行一次评议党员的活动。要通过评议，建立起对党员的考核和管理办法，做到日常有记录、季度有鉴定、半年有分析、全年搞评议。
    此外，还要加强监督、反对腐败，切实抓好机关的廉政建设。各机关对党员参加党内生活，履行党员义务和为政清廉等方面的情况，除日常督促检查外，每年要结合民主生活会进行两次检查，并公布检查结果，做得好的给予表扬，做得差的进行批评。监督的重点是党员领导干部。
    在这次会议上，北京市国家机关工委还提出党员干部要恢复参加集体生产劳动的制度，每个党员干部每年劳动不少于15天，并建立干部劳动手册。每半年对局级领导干部的劳动情况要进行一次检查，并公布检查结果。
    会议指出，加强党的基层组织建设是搞好党员管理的组织保证。目前机关专职党务干部无论从数量上还是从素质上都不能适应加强机关党的工作的需要。应选调一批政治素质好，有一定党务工作经验的同志充实和加强机关党的工作队伍。要建立健全机关党的工作机构。直属总支和支部也应设专职或半专职做党的工作。机关党委要把加强党支部建设列为重要工作议程，定期进行分析和研究，每年要对支部工作进行一次全面检查和总结，提出改进和加强支部建设的具体措施。
