Zhuzhou City in Hunan Province is steadfastly pushing forward with the enterprise contracting management system. While ensuring national interests, it continuously improves the external environment and guides enterprises to overcome short-term behavior and unfair distribution, making contracting once again the common choice of enterprise managers.

Zhuzhou City was one of the first in Hunan Province to implement comprehensive contracting for enterprises. This year, 68 budgetary city-owned enterprises completed their first contracting period. By mid-November, all these enterprises had entered the second round of contracting. It is reported that this is the first large-scale entry into the next round of contracting in an industrial city nationwide. People generally feel that, unlike the first round of contracting, the second round of contracting managers have bid farewell to the novelty and approach their responsibilities with a calm attitude.

Although the first round of contracting brought overall growth to Zhuzhou's economy, with the years 1987 and 1988 seeing a 15% to 31% increase in the total amount of taxes paid, enterprise profits retained, and total wages for employees compared to the previous two years, the second round of contracting in Zhuzhou also faces difficulties due to the current situation of tight funds, sluggish markets, and rising raw material prices. After the contracting plan was released in early September, there were significant differences between the government and the managing bureaus and enterprises during negotiations. On one hand, some factory directors and managers were hesitant and full of doubts; on the other hand, some managing bureaus stood on the side of the enterprises, emphasizing their own difficulties. By mid-October, not a single enterprise in the city was willing to sign a contract.

The municipal government carefully studied these situations and believed that the main reason was the inability to correctly handle the relationship between the state, enterprises, and employees. The municipal government and the leaders of the managing departments organized the contracting managers to study Jiang Zemin's National Day speech in relation to actual conditions, clarifying the significance of enterprise contracting. Through the study, many enterprise comrades said: When enterprises face difficulties, the state has supported us. Now, the state's difficulties are greater than those of the enterprises. Enterprises should establish a sense of the big picture and the whole, and voluntarily share the nation's burdens and make more contributions. Although the profit paid in the first year of the second round of contracting is 15.2% higher than the historical peak of 1988, and the annual growth rate of profit paid over three years of contracting is 10%, these enterprises still signed the contracting agreements happily.

In determining the contracting base, to ensure national fiscal revenue, Zhuzhou City adopted different contracting forms for different enterprises. For enterprises with significant market fluctuations in their products, the method of proportionally paying within the base and halving the payment proportion for the amount exceeding the base was adopted. For enterprises with stable economic benefits but heavy technical transformation tasks, the method of incremental contracting and full retention of excess income was adopted to "let the fish grow in the water." For enterprises that enjoyed national preferential policies in the previous round of contracting and will yield benefits in the next round, the method of base contracting and profit sharing for excess income was implemented. For state policy-subsidized enterprises, the method of loss contracting was adopted.

Zhuzhou City continuously improves the second round of contracting by summarizing the experience of the first round. For the strong reactions to the uneven contributions of industries, significant adjustments were made. At the same time, the city established effective systems and promoted "three guarantees and two links" in contracting enterprises, and also included repayment of loans, new product development, and indicators such as product quality, consumption, safety, and environmental protection in the contracting content, urging contracting parties to place enterprise contracting tasks and enterprise development on an equally important level. To create a good external environment for enterprise contracting, the city also took decisive measures to rectify the wind of arbitrary levies.

### 对不同企业确定不同承包形式　株洲企业进入第二轮承包

　　对不同企业确定不同承包形式
　　株洲企业进入第二轮承包
    本报长沙11月24日电　记者杜若原报道：湖南省株洲市坚定不移地推行企业承包经营制，在确保国家利益的前提下，不断改善外部环境，引导企业克服短期行为、分配不公等弊端，使承包再次成为企业家的共同选择。
    株洲市在湖南省较早对企业实施全面承包，今年有68家预算市属企业承包期满。截至11月中旬，这些企业全部进入了第二轮承包。据悉，这是全国率先大面积进入下一轮承包的工业城市。人们普遍反映，与第一轮承包不同的是，第二轮承包经营者已经告别那种新鲜感，而以冷静的姿态对待肩负的重任。
    虽然第一轮承包给株洲经济带来了全面增长，承包后的1987年和1988年比前两年，全市企业上缴利税、企业留利和职工工资总额都增长了15％至31％。但是，面对资金紧缺、市场疲软、原材料涨价的现状，株洲市的第二轮承包也面临着困难。承包方案9月上旬出台后，政府在与主管局和企业洽谈时，双方差距较大。一方面，一些厂长经理畏葸不前，疑虑重重；另一方面，有的主管局站在企业一边，强调自身困难，直至10月中旬，全市还没一家企业愿签合同。
    市政府认真研究了这些情况，认为主要原因在于不能正确处理国家、企业和职工三者关系。市政府和主管部门领导组织承包经营者联系实际学习江泽民同志国庆讲话，明确企业承包的意义。通过学习，许多企业的同志说：企业有困难时，国家扶持了我们，现在国家的困难比企业更大，企业应该树立大局和整体观念，自觉地为国分忧，多做贡献。虽然第二轮承包的头一年上缴利润比历史上最高水平的1988年还要增长15.2％，承包3年上缴利润的年递增率为10％，这些企业还是愉快地签订了承包合同。
    在确定承包基数时，为确保国家财政收入，株洲市针对不同的企业确定不同的承包形式。对产品市场变化大的企业，采取承包基数内按比例上缴、超基数部分上缴比例减半的形式；对经济效益稳定，但技术改造任务重的企业，采取递增包干、超收全留的办法“放水养鱼”；对在前一轮承包中享受了国家优惠，在下一轮承包中将发挥效益的企业，实行基数包干、超收分成；对国家政策性补贴企业则实行亏损包干。
    株洲市通过总结第一轮承包的经验，不断完善第二轮承包。对反应强烈的行业贡献不均现象，进行了大幅度调整。同时，市里建立有效的制度，在承包企业中全面推行“三保两挂”，并将归还贷款、新产品开发和产品质量、消耗、安全、环保等指标也列入承包内容，促使承包人把企业承包任务和企业后劲摆在同等重要的位置。为了给企业承包创造良好的外部环境，该市还采取断然措施整治摊派风。
