Before "Going into Business"

"Going into Business"!

Zhou Changbin and Zhang Ying were eager to try their hand at business, ready to dive into the surging tide of commercial activity. They were two intellectuals: one had once served as the deputy director of the propaganda department in the army, and the other was a "penman" in a certain unit. Before "going into business," the two strolled along the seaside in Qingdao. For some reason, the sea seemed so crowded, tense, and heavy. The harbor was filled with ships, the sea surface was covered with oil stains, and sewage pipes continuously discharged the city's digested waste into the sea. Everywhere there were people, and everyone seemed to be doing business (perhaps a bit exaggerated). There were stalls selling miscellaneous goods, bookstalls, color photo enlargements, tourist services, shoe repairs, and vendors selling audio and video tapes, seashells, and stinky tofu. Even products with "export for domestic consumption" signs were everywhere. Behind this bustling scene, what was hidden? A distorted and abnormal commercial culture! Literature, art, thought, theory, and steel, fertilizer, refrigerators, and color TVs were all mixed together and bought and sold. Artists, scientists, and party, government, military, civilian, and academic personnel seemed to have all been drawn into commercial activities. Every inch of social space had become a market. Supply and demand determined the value of things. Market prices controlled everything. As one philosopher said: "Without the shouting and screaming in the market, there would be no genius today."

**The "Genius" Calculates Profits**

Genius needs to be expressed. At first, Zhang Ying's expression seemed a bit "stupid." He set up a comprehensive service company in a small city with an initial capital of 250,000 yuan. At the grand opening banquet, 10% of the capital was spent on feasting, and the remaining amount was used to buy plywood, which was stacked in the warehouse. Like a big-bellied man, he borrowed another 200,000 yuan, almost emptying the stock of plywood from various stores. "Don't sell!" He sat on the sofa, holding a novel by Jin Yong, and refused all buyers. Whether it was the furniture boom that caused the shortage of plywood or the shortage of plywood that stimulated the furniture boom, in just over ten days, the price of plywood soared again and again. "Sell!" He finally put down Jin Yong. Congratulations on making a profit: over 300,000 yuan. He proudly said: "Scarcity is profit. Those who can take advantage of scarcity to make a profit are just smart businessmen. Those who can create scarcity are true geniuses in business."

What kind of "genius" is this? This is the "genius" of a local rich man, the most primitive way of making money used by local rich men to hoard grain for sale in times of disaster to make a fortune. Hoarding TVs, refrigerators, steel, and fertilizer, in recent years, the shortage of many goods was largely caused by artificial hoarding. Worth pondering is, why can this way of making money, born out of the greed of local rich men, flourish under the banner of modern commodity economy? Whose tragedy is this? Is it material poverty or spiritual ignorance?

At this moment, Zhou Changbin's mind was not so abstract. He just couldn't understand a company in front of him: the sign had famous calligraphy, the business card had a fragrant smell, and the facade was very luxurious, but why was the business concept so outdated?

That company and Zhou Changbin's "Long City" Color Enlargement Center simultaneously purchased a batch of color film. At that time, color film was relatively scarce in the market, and the manager of the other party discussed with Zhou Changbin to hold it for a while and sell it at a high price during the tourist season. "Having goods and not selling, what kind of business sense is that?" Zhou Changbin seemed a bit slow. The manager thought Zhou Changbin hadn't calculated this account, so he took out a calculator and quickly typed out a series of numbers, saying: "Brother, just hold it for half a month, and you can make an extra 300,000 yuan!"

"I've already calculated this account." Zhou Changbin had another account: creating scarcity also creates chaos! In recent years, with the flow of commodities, the evils of using power for private gain, buying and selling, bribery, embezzlement, and theft have been bred and spread. The root cause is scarcity. "Meeting market demand, this is my principle. For this, I am willing to make less money." He said.

The manager organized a group of people. 30 rolls, 50 rolls, they bought up "Long City's" film at retail prices. "Well, let's see!" Zhou Changbin remained calm, sending people to Guangzhou to urgently purchase 50,000 rolls of film. When the tourist season arrived, the manager proudly raised the price, thinking the huge profit was in hand. Zhou Changbin seized the opportunity, using the same price to let the film flood the market. The manager was in agony, cursing, "Zhou Changbin has really harmed me!"

"Haha, if you don't suffer, the people will suffer." Zhou Changbin was really proud for a few days. He spoke the truth, "Our material supply is not that abundant, and the Chinese people do not have much money. If businessmen all do this, will the people be able to live?"

**The Principles of Competition**

Zhou Changbin also had his bitter moments. His body and soul were both drawn into a color enlargement war. In just the urban area of Qingdao, more than 300 color enlargement businesses sprouted up like mushrooms after rain. The original miscellaneous goods stores, bookstalls, hotels, and shoe repair stalls all competed to put up signs for selling and developing color film. At that time, a saying circulated in society: "Party, government, military, civilians, and students, east, west, south, north, and center, you fight me and I fight you for color enlargement." They shouted hoarsely to attract customers, kept their eyes on the ever-changing market, racked their brains to think of ways to defeat their opponents, and crazily bought film, photo paper, and photographic equipment. Everything was for making money, trying to get as much of the money consumers paid for leaving beautiful memories into their own pockets.

In this chaotic war, Zhou Changbin began to feel a bit flustered: 8 jiao, 6 jiao, 4 jiao... the price line was broken. He retreated again and again, struggling to cope. At this time, Zhang Ying came to Qingdao to purchase goods. Still, on the pier by the sea, the two intellectuals who had "gone into business" at the same time shared their bittersweet experiences of the past year. Talking about the color enlargement war, Zhang Ying said: "Although I don't understand color enlargement, no matter what business you do, there is an iron principle: how to make money, do it that way! First, you have to defeat your main opponent. Your main opponent is the state-owned photo studio. As for the methods, four words: flexible and mobile..."

Zhou Changbin knew the specific content of these four words: one is to reduce prices and give discounts. The price per photo for individuals had dropped to 3 jiao, while the state-owned photo studio was 6 jiao. Two is to give commissions to those who bring in business. An individual businessman did not hide the fact: "Every 5 yuan I throw out, I can make a profit of 50 yuan." Three is to monopolize film, photo paper, and developing solutions as much as possible. After more than a year of operation, "Long City" had developed into a company with 1.1 million yuan in fixed assets and an annual profit of 600,000 yuan, making it one of the leading enterprises in the photography industry in Qingdao, with sufficient capital to monopolize the market.

However, Zhou Changbin did the opposite. He formed a united front with several managers of state-owned enterprises, stabilizing the price at about 2 jiao higher than individual businesses, competing on quality. No commissions were given. One roll of photo paper cost 570 yuan, and even if the price per photo was reduced by 5 fen, it could still make a profit of 1 jiao 2 fen. But he did not add profit and transferred it to the state-owned photo studio at cost. The "Evergreen" photo studio set up a color enlargement point in Zicheng County. Some local photo professionals, who were old customers of "Long City," enjoyed preferential treatment, so they still went to "Long City" for developing. To avoid competing with "Evergreen" for the market, Zhou Changbin bit the bullet and canceled their preferential treatment. For this, "Long City" reduced its monthly profit by more than 100,000 yuan.

At the farewell banquet with old customers, he said emotionally: "Thank you for your trust and support over the years. But 'Evergreen' is a state-owned enterprise and has always had a good relationship with our 'Long City.' You say I am not considerate, you say I am stupid, I accept it, but 'Evergreen' has invested, and I can't watch them lose money."

Later, Zhang Ying said to Zhou Changbin: "Market competition does not distinguish between the nature of enterprises! In recent years, the reason our economy has developed slowly is that there is a lack of fair competition. The state has taken too much care of state-owned enterprises. Some state-owned enterprises, even without economic benefits, still enjoy special treatment..."

Zhou Changbin said: "State-owned enterprises belong to the state. If the state does not take care of state-owned enterprises, should it take care of private enterprises? I am a collective enterprise here, with no right to grab the market and raw materials to compete with state enterprises. Our only way out is to be a good supporting actor, and those who compete with state enterprises will eventually collapse!"

**Helpless Compromise**

Zhang Ying sold whatever he could make money from: chemical raw materials, photographic equipment, household appliances, hardware and electrical supplies, cigarettes, tea, sugar, and building materials... Exceeding the scope of business? Just change the purchase order and invoice, and the problem is solved. "The business license is dead, but people are alive." He said nonchalantly. In this flexible operation, he fully utilized the powerful influence of "relationships." He hired several employees who couldn't do anything at high salaries and didn't let them do anything. But their relatives and friends could do everything. "This is called knowing people and using them well." He said proudly. Commissions, bonuses, red envelopes, treating and giving gifts, he used every means to mobilize all positive factors, creating huge profits for the company, and was praised as a "great man."

If it comes to "relationships," Zhou Changbin is not inferior to Zhang Ying. He has a full notebook of "relationships," and someone once half-jokingly said that his address book and business card holder are "money trees," willing to buy them at a high price. We cannot deny this economic form composed of factors such as emotions, interests, social status, political rights, and even gangs and clans. The normal laws of commodity economy have been changed. A batch of film, others can't buy it at a high price, but Zhou Changbin can get it at a low price. Even he himself felt a bit embarrassed: "We served in the army together, old comrades, of course, they will take care of me." In business activities, using emotional factors (normal economic relationships should exclude any non-economic factors), compared to using power and bribery, it seems pure.

Eliminate "relationships"? Zhou Changbin doesn't have the power, and society needs long-term efforts. In today's "relationships" still play a role (often a decisive role), the compromise he made is to only allow himself to use the emotional factors in "relationships."

Last year, Zhou Changbin purchased a batch of timers. Due to the sluggish consumer market, like hungry subjects who can no longer accept the king's favors, consumers touched their pockets and left—timers were piled up in the warehouse in a sorry state. Someone said: "Now there is nothing that can't be bought, and nothing that can't be sold. Just..." The person made a gesture of counting money. "Don't give me the black market, if I use money to open the way, I'd rather let it rot!" Zhou Changbin said. Although he spoke tough, his heart was anxious. Those beautiful timers, the red numbers flashing on the screen, seemed to be sending a danger signal: nearly 2 million yuan in circulating funds were locked in the dark warehouse! Money is alive. Once life stops moving, death comes. But how did life stop moving: was it due to wrong decisions, laziness, ignorance, blindness, carelessness, greed, low intelligence, and over-cleverness, speculation, and risk-taking?

Soon, someone came to the door, willing to buy all the timers, with the condition of getting 30 tons of diesel, 50 tons of steel, 10 tons of polyethylene, and 60 tons of fertilizer. These things Zhou Changbin could indeed buy. But he had three principles when buying these things: only help users buy, not traders; only help the powerless buy, not the powerful; only fulfill obligations, not make profits. But the other party was within his "not helping" category. Zhou Changbin had long calculated: to get so many things, resell them, even if the timers were smashed, it would still be profitable. "I don't have that much ability." Zhou Changbin refused to say. "Don't be modest, last year you wrote a letter..."

The other party somehow got the "intelligence"—

That time, Zhou Changbin was on a business trip and happened to meet two village cadres who were bowing and begging everywhere to buy diesel and fertilizer. It was the critical time for summer harvest and summer planting, and the materials that should have been supplied to them had flown away. Perhaps they had drunk a bit, and they angrily cursed the evil winds, then cried loudly, "Farmers!" Zhou Changbin was moved and wrote a letter, letting them take it to his "relationships." The letter said:

"You might as well risk making a mistake and help them out!... I will definitely repay you in the future." The matter was settled. In the autumn, the village cadres brought some money and peanuts to thank Zhou Changbin. He refused the money and kept the peanuts.

Hearing the other party mention this matter, Zhou Changbin said: "You are doing business, let's not talk about big principles. The basic principle of transactions is fairness and reasonableness, your conditions are not fair." The other party calculated for a long time and said seriously, "You processed the accumulated goods, avoided losses, and we had a little surplus, how is that not fair?" "You forgot one thing, I am equivalent to indirectly operating scarce materials, if it is found out in the future, fines are small, and I might be punished. You make money, and I suffer, is that fair?" This seemingly unreasonable reasoning made the other party speechless.

It seems that non-economic factors still need to be excluded by non-economic means!

**Above the Sacred Profit**

"Profit is sacred!" Zhang Ying said. "Humanity is sacred!" Zhou Changbin said.

Scholars doing business always avoid being controlled by thoughts and theories. Zhang Ying advocates sacred profit because altruism hinders his development. That batch of slightly spoiled fish, if not considering the interests of consumers, would not have resulted in a loss. That batch of books, with a few slightly exposed illustrations, if not considering social benefits, 4,000 yuan would have been easily earned. There was also that batch of building materials, if not considering the financial difficulties of state-owned construction companies, selling to private or collective construction teams could have made twice the profit. In business activities, there are so many other interests to consider, and he strongly felt that altruism and the principle of profit are incompatible. He set a principle for himself: ruthlessly exclude altruism in business activities! A relative came to buy a color TV and asked for a discount, and he coldly refused, saying: "I recognize this relative, but economic laws do not recognize relatives." Strangely, his exclusion of altruism started with this seemingly selfless behavior. A person who does not consider his own relatives, how can he consider people outside his relatives? Next was a batch of fake "Maotai." He stared at the "Maotai" bottles, hesitating. In a daze, he seemed to see the bottles of "Maotai" turn into stacks of cash, and he gritted his teeth: sell! Profit is sacred, and in economic activities, nothing has the right to stand above profit.

Zhou Changbin also faced the choice between self-interest and altruism: he carelessly bought 500 rolls of expired Kodak photo paper. Either he would suffer a loss, or the customer would. Just as he was hesitating, Zhang Ying came and said to him: "There is no commerce without trickery. Besides, these papers are not unusable, just a bit lower in quality." The words were said so lightly that Zhou Changbin felt a chill. "Cheating people, that is the behavior of a trickster!" He said.

It seemed that to enlighten him, Zhang Ying talked endlessly: "I admit, selfishness is evil, and selflessness is good. But economic free competition cannot do without evil. Reasonable selfishness is more beneficial to economic development than altruism. Perfectly virtuous gentlemen are only suitable for preaching and have no right to participate in economic activities. Similarly, as long as you participate in economic activities, as long as you are for making profits, you are no longer a perfectly virtuous gentleman, no matter what you say."

Zhou Changbin became a bit excited and said: "I admit that in economic activities, profit is sacred, but above the sacred profit, there is an even more sacred humanity! Using altruism to exclude commodity economy is hypocrisy, a false gentleman. But using selfishness to exclude morality and humanity is evil. In economic activities, what is the relationship between altruism and selfishness, I lack theoretical research, but I cannot make a profit by cheating people, at least emotionally, I dislike tricksters."

Later, a person who specialized in theoretical research heard about their argument and flipped through the works of Marx and Engels, finding what he thought was a relatively accurate answer: the opposition between selfishness and altruism is actually a manifestation of the split between individuals and individuals, and individuals and society under the conditions of private ownership. Marxists "neither use selfishness to oppose self-sacrifice, nor use self-sacrifice to oppose selfishness... but to reveal the material roots of this opposition, and with the disappearance of the material roots, this opposition will naturally disappear."

**The Ability to Control Money**

"I have a batch of domestically produced goods with foreign labels. If you take them, I will give you a 5% commission."

"I never do business with people who talk about commissions!" Zhou Changbin slammed the door and chased the other party away. "Going into business" for 3 years, he had withstood countless attacks of cash (and color TVs, refrigerators, etc.). Whenever a "danger" appeared, he always asked himself a series of questions: what do we really want (he had discussed this issue with Zhang Ying many times)? Is it to pursue spiritual sublimity or to pursue the satisfaction of material desires? Can purity and material enjoyment be unified? Is the sole purpose of commercial activities to make money? How much control do morality and ethics have over money?

The charm of money is truly incredible. When 10 hundred-yuan bills were placed in front of Zhang Ying, he blushed slightly and put them in his pocket. To be fair, Zhang Ying had once set a rule for himself: even if he made 100 million yuan for the collective, he would not take a single cent. Just after "going into business," he had indeed resisted the temptation of money a few times. For some reason, after becoming proficient in "swimming," he choked on a mouthful of water? The matter was exposed, the money was returned, and he was removed from his position. He reviewed his experiences after "going into business," reflecting on his changes in thought: was it excessive consumption or low income? Was it the loss of morality or the development of society? Was it the ambiguity of policy boundaries or the laxity of laws? What is the relationship between the direction of business and human conscience?

The waves roared. The sea turned Qingdao blue. Zhang Ying sat alone on the beach, ashamed to see Zhou Changbin. His face was gaunt, and his hair had turned white—how much inner value has humanity sacrificed for external purposes!

Zhang Ying muttered to himself: "What do we really want?"

### 我们到底要什么？

    我们到底要什么？
    贾鲁生
   “下海”之前
    “下海”！
    周长斌和张莹跃跃欲试，准备投入经商的滚滚浪潮中。这是两个文人，一个曾经在部队担任过宣传处副处长，一个是某单位的“笔杆子”。“下海”之前，俩人在青岛市海滨漫步。不知为什么大海也变得那么拥挤、紧张、沉重了。港湾挤满了船只，海面上飘浮着油污，污水管道不停地向大海中排泄城市消化后的废物。到处都是人，人人都在做生意（也许有些夸张）。杂货亭，书刊亭，彩色扩印点，旅游服务点，修鞋的，兜售录音、录像带的，卖贝壳的，卖臭豆腐的挂着“出口转内销”牌子的。在这闹哄哄的表象后面掩藏着什么？一个畸形变态的商业文化！文学、艺术、思想、理论和钢材、化肥、冰箱、彩电搭配在一起，被买进卖出。艺术家、科学家、党政军民学，似乎都卷入了商业活动中。社会空间的每一寸空隙都变成了市场。供求关系决定着事物的价值。市场价格支配着一切。正如一位哲学家所说：“没有市场上的喊叫和嘶嘎声，如今便没有天才。”
            “天才”算帐
    天才是需要表现的。开始，张莹的表现似乎有些“蠢”。他在一个小城市里办了个综合服务公司。2.5万元的创办资金，在“开张大吉”的宴会上吃喝了10％，剩余的全部买了胶合板堆在仓库里。像个大肚子汉似的，又贷款20万元，几乎把各家商店库存的胶合板吞食一空。“不卖！”他坐在沙发上，捧着本金庸的武侠小说把所有的买主拒之门外。不知是因为家具热造成了胶合板的短缺，还是因为胶合板的短缺刺激了家具热，在短短10多天的时间内胶合板的价格便一涨再涨。“卖！”他终于放下了金庸。恭喜发财：获利3万多元。他得意扬扬地说：“短缺就是利润。善于利用短缺赚取利润的，不过是个精明的生意人。而能够制造短缺的，才称得上是天才的生意人。”
    这是什么样的“天才”？这是土财主式的“天才”，是土财主们经常使用过的囤积粮食以待灾年抛售谋取暴利的最原始的发财之道。囤积彩电，囤积冰箱，囤积钢材，囤积化肥，前些年许多商品的紧缺在很大程度上是由人为的囤积造成的。值得思索的是，这种出自土财主贪婪本能的发财之道为什么能够在现代商品经济的旗帜下盛行起来？这是谁的悲哀？是物质的贫乏还是精神的愚昧？
    此刻，周长斌脑子里的问号没有那么抽象。他只是对眼前一家公司不理解：牌子上是名人书法，名片飘逸着香味儿，门面装潢的十分豪华，为什么经营观念却那样陈旧呢？
      那家公司和周长斌的长城彩扩中心同时购进来一批彩色胶卷。当时市面上彩卷比较紧张，对方的经理就和周长斌商量压上一段时间等到旅游旺季再高价销售。“有东西不卖，这是哪门子的生意经？”周长斌显得有些迟钝了。那位经理以为周长斌没有算过这笔帐，就拿出计算器，飞快地打出一串数字，说：“老兄，只要压上半个月，你就能多赚3万多元钱！”
      “这个账我早已算过了。”周长斌另有一笔账：制造短缺同时也就制造了混乱！这些年来，以权谋私，倒买倒卖，行贿受贿，贪污盗窃，邪恶在商品流通领域的混乱中滋生扩散，说到底根子在短缺。“满足市场需求，这就是我的原则。为此我宁肯少赚点钱。”他说。
      那位经理组织了一批人。30卷、50卷，以零
  售价格把“长城”的胶卷抢购一空。“好哇，走着瞧！”周长斌不动声色，派人到广州紧急购进5万个彩卷。等到旅游旺季，那位经理得意地提高了价格，以为暴利到手了。周长斌看准时机，用平价让胶卷潮水般地涌入市场，那位经理叫苦连天，恨恨地说：“周长斌可把我害苦了！”
      “嘿嘿，你要是不叫苦，老百姓可就叫苦了。”周长斌着实得意了几天。他说的是大实话，“本来我们的物资供应就不是那么丰富，本来中国的老百姓就没有多少钱，生意人如果都像这个黑法，还让不让老百姓活了？”
            竞争的原则
    周长斌也有被害苦的时候。他的躯体和灵魂同时被卷入了一场彩色扩印大战之中。仅青岛市区就雨后春笋般地冒出了300多家彩色扩印经营体。原先的杂货店、书刊亭、旅馆处、修鞋摊，竞相亮出了代售代冲彩卷的招牌。当时社会上流传着一句话：“党政军民学，东西南北中，你争我夺上彩扩。”声嘶力竭地叫喊着招揽生意，眼睛一眨不眨地盯着瞬息万变的市场，绞尽脑汁思索击败对手的办法，疯狂地抢购胶卷、相纸和照相器材，一切都是为了赚钱，把消费者为留下美好记忆而付出的钞票尽可能多地赚到自己的腰包里。
    在这场混战中，周长斌开始显得有些手忙脚乱：8角、6角、4角……价格的防线被突破了。他一退再退，疲于应付。这时候，张莹来青岛采购货物。仍然是在栈桥海滨，两个同时“下海”的文人相互诉说一年多来的酸甜苦辣。谈到彩扩大战，张莹说：“虽然我不懂彩扩，可是不论做什么生意，都有一个铁的原则：怎么赚钱怎么干！首先你要击败主要对手。你的主要对手是国营照相馆。至于方法嘛，四个字：灵活机动……”
    周长斌知道这四个字的具体内容：一是压价让利。每张片子的价格个体户已经降到3角钱，而国营照相馆是6角钱。二是给揽活者回扣。一位个体户毫不掩饰地说：“我每扔出5元钱，就能赚回50元的厚利。”三是尽可能垄断胶卷、相纸和冲扩药液。经过一年多的经营，“长城”已发展成为拥有110万元的固定资产、年利润达到60万元，在青岛市照相行业中是数得着的企业了，有雄厚的资金垄断市场。
    谁知，周长斌却来了个反向的机动灵活。他和几家国营企业的经理结成了统一战线，把价格稳定在高于个体户2角钱左右，靠质量竞争。回扣一分没有。一卷相纸进价570元，如果自己扩印，即使每张片子收费降低5分钱，仍然能赚1角2分钱。可是他却不加利润地转让给了国营照相馆。“万年青”照相馆在诸城县设了一个彩扩点。当地一些照相专业户因为是“长城”的老主顾，享受优惠待遇，所以依然舍近求远到“长城”来冲扩。为了不和“万年青”争夺市场，周长斌狠狠心，免除了他们的优惠待遇。为此，“长城”每月减少利润上万元。
      在和老主顾们告别的宴席上，他动情地说：“感谢诸位多年来对我的信任和支持。但‘万年青’是国营企业，和我们‘长城’一直关系很好。你们说我不讲情面，说我傻，我都认了，可是‘万年青’投了资，我不能看着他们亏本。”
    后来，张莹对周长斌说：“市场竞争是不分企业性质的！这些年来，我们的经济之所以发展缓慢，一个重要原因就是缺少公平的竞争，国家对国营企业照顾太多。一些国营企业即使没有经济效益，也享受特殊待遇……”
    周长斌说：“国营企业是属于国家的，国家不照顾国家的企业，难道要照顾私人的企业吗？我这儿是集体企业，没有权利抢市场，抢原材料，和国家企业竞争。我们唯一的出路就是当好配角，和国家企业竞争的，早晚要垮台！”
            无可奈何的妥协
    张莹是什么赚钱就买卖什么：化工原料，照相器材，家用电器，五金交电，烟酒糖茶，建筑材料……超范围经营吗？把进货单和发票改写一下，问题就解决了。“营业执照是死的，但人是活的。”他满不在乎地说。在这种灵活的经营过程中，他充分发挥“关系学”的强大威力。他高薪聘用了几个什么也干不了的职工，什么也不让他们干。可是他们的亲戚朋友却什么都能干。“这叫做知人善任。”他得意地说。回扣、提成、小红包、请客送礼，他用尽一切手段调动一切积极因素，为公司创造了巨额利润，被誉为“大能人”。
    如果讲“关系学”，周长斌并不比张莹差。他有满满一大本子的“关系户”，曾经有人半开玩笑地说他的通信录和名片夹是“摇钱树”，愿意出高价收买。我们不能否认这种由情感、利益、社会地位、政治权利，甚至帮派、家族等等因素所构成的一种畸形的经济形态。商品经济的正常规律被改变了。一批胶卷，别人出高价买不来，周长斌低价就能拿到手。连他自己也有些不好意思：“我们一块当过兵，老战友了，人家当然照顾我。”在经营活动中利用情感因素（正常的经济关系应该是排斥任何非经济因素的），比起利用权势和贿赂来，竟然显得纯洁了。
    消灭“关系学”吗？周长斌没有力量，社会也需要经过长时间努力。在“关系学”依然起作用（常常起决定作用）的今天，他所做的妥协就是只允许自己使用“关系学”中的情感因素。
      去年，周长斌购进了一批记时器。由于消费市场疲软，如同饥饿的臣民已经无力领取君王的赏赐，消费者们在柜台前摸摸口袋便离去了——记时器凄凉地堆积在库房里。有人说：“现在没有买不到的东西，也没有卖不出去的东西。只要……”那人做了个点钞票的姿势。“你别给我来黑的，要是用票子开路，我豁上搁烂了！”周长斌说。嘴上很硬，心中却焦虑不安。那一只只漂亮的记时器，红色的数字在荧光屏上不停地闪烁着，似乎在发出危险警报：近20万元的流动资金被禁锢在昏暗的库房里！资金是有生命的。生命停止了运动，死亡也就降临了。然而生命是怎样停止运动的：是由于决策失误，惰性，无知，盲目，疏忽大意，贪婪，智商太低和过于精明，投机与冒险？
    不久，又有人找上门来愿意全部买下记时器，条件是给他们搞30吨柴油、50吨钢材、10吨聚乙烯、60吨化肥。这些东西周长斌确实能买到。但是他在买这类东西的时候有3个原则：只帮使用者买，不帮经营者买；只帮无权无势者买，不帮有权有势者买；只尽义务，不赚便宜。但是来人却在他的“不帮”范畴里。周长斌早就算清了：要那么多的东西，转手倒卖，即便把记时器都砸了，也合算。“我没那么大的本事。”周长斌拒绝说。“你别谦虚了，去年你一封信……”对方不知从哪儿得来的“情报”——
    那一次，周长斌出差偶然遇见两个村干部到处磕头作揖求购柴油、化肥。正是夏收夏种的关键时刻，应该供应给他们的物资不知飞哪儿去了。大概是喝了点酒，他们气愤地破口大骂不正之风，一会儿又一口一个“庄稼人”的号啕大哭。周长斌一激动，就写了封信，让他们拿着去找自己的“关系户”。信中说：
  “你就豁上犯错误，也给他们帮帮忙！……将来我一定报答你。”事情办成了。秋后，村干部带了一些钱和花生来感谢周长斌。他拒绝了钱，留下了花生。
    听对方提起这件事，周长斌说：“你们是要做交易，咱们就别讲大道理了。交易的基本原则是公平合理，你们的条件不公平。”对方计算了半天，很认真地说，“你处理了积压货，避免了损失，我们略有赢余，怎么不公平？”“你们少算了一条，我这就等于变相经营紧缺物资，万一将来被查着了，罚款事小，说不定就得受处分。你们赚钱我倒霉，这公平吗？”这种近乎不讲道理的道理，说得对方哑口无言。
    看来，非经济的因素还需要用非经济的手段来排斥！
            在神圣的利润之上
    “利润是神圣的！”张莹说。“人性是神圣的！”周长斌说。
    秀才经商，总免不了受思想和理论的支配。张莹赞成神圣的利润，因为利他主义妨碍了他的发展。那一批鱼稍稍有点变质，如果不是考虑消费者的利益，也不至于亏本。那一批图书，有几页稍稍暴露的插图，如果不是考虑社会效益，4000多元钱稳赚到手了。还有那一批建筑材料，如果不是考虑到国营建筑公司资金困难，卖给私人或集体建筑队可以多赚一倍的钱。在经营活动中有那么多的他人利益需要兼顾，他强烈地感觉到利他主义与利润的原则格格不入。他为自己确定了一个原则：在经营过程中毫不留情地排斥利他主义！一位亲戚来买彩电，求他给个优惠价，他冷冷地拒绝说：“我认你这门亲戚，可是经济规律是六亲不认。”奇怪，他对利他主义的排斥竟然是从这种看来是大公无私的行为开始的。连自己的亲戚都不考虑的人，怎么能够考虑亲戚之外的人呢？接下来是一批假“茅台”。他紧盯着“茅台”瓶子，心中犹豫不决。恍惚间，他仿佛觉得那一瓶瓶“茅台”变成了一摞摞钞票，一咬牙：卖！利润是神圣的，在经济活动中任何东西都没有权利凌驾于利润之上。
      周长斌也面临着利己和利他的选择：疏忽了，购进500卷过期的柯达相纸。要么自己吃亏，要么顾客吃亏。正在犹豫，张莹来了，对他说：“无奸不商。何况这些相纸不是不能用，不过质量稍差些。”话说得那样轻松使周长斌不寒而栗。“坑人，那是奸商的行为！”他说。
    似乎是为了开导他，张莹滔滔不绝地说：“我承认，自私就是恶，无私就是善。但经济的自由竞争是离不开恶的。合理的利己主义比较起利他主义更有利于经济的发展。完美无缺的正人君子只配传教，没有资格参与经济活动。同样，只要你参与了经济活动，只要你是为了赚取利润，你就已经不是正人君子了，不管你嘴里说什么。”
    周长斌有些激动了，他说：“我承认在经济活动中利润是神圣的，可是在神圣的利润之上，还有一个更为神圣的人性！用利他主义来排斥商品经济，那是假道学，伪君子。可是用利己主义来排斥道德和人性，那是邪恶。在经济活动中，利他主义和利己主义究竟是个什么关系，我缺少理论的研究，可是我决不能靠坑人赚取利润，至少在情感上我讨厌奸商。”
    后来，一位专门搞理论研究的人听说了他们的争论，便翻阅了马恩著作，找出了他自认为是比较准确的答案：利己主义与利他主义的对立，实际上是在私有制条件下个人与个人之间、个人与社会之间分裂的表现形态。马克思主义者“既不拿利己主义来反对自我牺牲，也不拿自我牺牲来反对利己主义……而是在于揭示这个对立的物质根源，随着物质根源的消失，这种对立自然而然也就消失了。”
          对金钱的驾驭能力
      “我有一批贴外国商标的国产货，如果你收下了，给你5％的回扣。”
      “我从来不跟谈回扣的人做生意！”周长斌一拉门，把对方轰走了。“下海”已经3年了，他顶住了数不清的钞票（还有彩电、冰箱等等）的轮番攻击。每当“险情”出现时，他总要向自己发出一连串的问号：我们到底要什么（他多次和张莹探讨过这个问题）？是追求精神的崇高还是追求物欲的满足？清心寡欲和物质享受能否统一起来？商业活动的唯一目的就是赚钱吗？道德、伦理对金钱的驾驭能力究竟有多大？
    钞票的魅力真是不可思议。当10张百元钞票摆到张莹面前的时候，他稍稍脸红了一下，就揣进了腰包。公道地说，张莹也曾经给自己定过一个规矩：即使给集体赚100万，自己也不捞一分。刚“下海”时，他确实也有几次抵制了金钱的诱惑。不知为什么当“水性”熟练之后，反而呛了一大口水？事情败露，退还赃款，被撤销职务。他一幕幕地回顾“下海”后的经历，思索、反省着自己的思想变化：是消费过高还是收入过低？是道德失落了还是社会发展了？是政策界线的模糊还是法律的松懈？经营方向和人性良知究竟是个什么关系？
    海浪哗哗。海水染蓝了青岛。张莹独自坐在海滩上，由于惭愧，他不好意思见到周长斌。他面容憔悴，头发白了许多——人类“在外在事物的目的上牺牲了多少内心价值”！
      张莹自言自语道：“我们到底要什么？”
