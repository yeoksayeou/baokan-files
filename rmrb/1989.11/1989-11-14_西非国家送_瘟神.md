    West African Countries Send Away the "Plague"
    By People's Daily reporter Yang Rusheng

    According to reports from Ivory Coast newspapers, on September 16, a European merchant ship named Yolande Delmas secretly unloaded three refrigerated containers at the port of Abidjan, Fréjus, intending to transfer them to Ghana. A few days earlier, the ship had docked in Lomé, Togo, but because the containers were suspected of carrying irradiated frozen meat, they were unloaded and then reloaded onto the ship. After some complications, the ship arrived in Abidjan.

    Skilled technicians at the port of Abidjan used advanced safety inspection equipment to quickly determine that the meat had been contaminated by radiation and had been stored in the warehouse for several years, posing a significant threat to human health and unsuitable for consumption. They resolutely refused to accept the shipment. To prevent such toxic food from entering the country again, the Ministry of Livestock in Ivory Coast immediately decided to temporarily ban the unloading of frozen meat at the country's seaports.

    Meanwhile, two other ships loaded with the same type of cargo were intercepted in Owendo, Gabon. The ships carried 400 tons of frozen meat from a Western European country. The Gabonese government took even stricter measures, burning part of the cargo on the spot, and the remaining cargo was reloaded onto the ships, which were then escorted by the Gabonese navy several miles out to sea, where the "plague" was sent away.

    Last summer, some Western wealthy countries, disregarding the lives of others, dumped nuclear waste and toxic garbage in poor African countries, causing an international outcry and leaving a lasting impression. A year later, they are now trying to dump their toxic food in Africa, naturally facing opposition from African countries. In the past, there have also been incidents of Western countries selling expired drugs and spoiled food to Africa.

    African countries are currently facing severe economic difficulties. Instead of helping to cancel trade protectionism, stabilize primary product prices, and reduce the debt of African countries, some Western countries are taking advantage of the situation and pushing them further into the abyss. Such behavior is a stark contrast to their claims of "human rights" and "humanitarianism."

    西非国家送“瘟神”
    本报记者　杨汝生
    据科特迪瓦报纸报道，九月十六日，一艘名叫约兰德·德尔马斯的欧洲商船偷偷摸摸地将三个冷藏集装箱卸在阿比让的夫里迪港口，打算由此转运到加纳。几天前，这船曾在多哥的洛美港停靠，但因集装箱里装的是被怀疑受到核辐射的冻肉，所以卸下后又被原封不动地装回了船上。经过一番周折，这船又到了阿比让。
    阿比让港熟练的技术人员运用先进的安全检验设备，很快断定这些肉食受过核污染，且已在仓库里贮存了几年，对人体非常有害，不能食用。他们毅然将这批货物拒之门外。为了避免这类有毒食品再次入境，科特迪瓦畜产部当即作出决定，在一段时期内禁止冷藏肉在本国海港卸船。
    与此同时，另外两艘满载同种货物的船只在加蓬的奥文多港被查禁，船上装有来自某个西欧国家的四百吨冻肉。加蓬政府采取了更为严厉的措施，当场焚烧了一部分货物，剩余的重新装船，由加蓬海军押送到几海里远的地方，“瘟神”被送走了。
    去年夏天，一些西方富国不顾他人的死活，向非洲穷国倾倒核废料和有毒垃圾，世界舆论为之哗然，人们至今记忆犹新。时隔一年，他们又把自己不吃的有毒食品往非洲倾销，理所当然地遭到非洲国家的反对。过去还发生过西方国家向非洲出售过期药品和变质食品的事情。
    非洲国家当前普遍遇到严重的经济困难，西方一些国家不是在取消贸易保护主义、稳定初级产品价格、减少非洲国家债务方面尽力，而是乘人之危、落井下石，这种行为对于他们宣称的“人权”、“人道”来说，实在是个莫大的讽刺。
