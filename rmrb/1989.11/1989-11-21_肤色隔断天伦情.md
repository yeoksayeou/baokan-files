Currently in the United States, the number of white couples adopting black children is increasing year by year. Taking San Francisco as an example, out of the 4,200 children adopted this year, 70% are black children, while the adoptive parents are almost all white. However, many local governments do not allow this practice, demanding that white couples give up their adopted black children. This decision has infuriated the white couples. Thus, conflicts have arisen between the government and the white couples. White woman Kathy Pauline adopted two black children. Recently, the San Francisco Department of Social Public Affairs warned her that due to racial differences, this adoption relationship cannot be recognized. Pauline said in pain, "When I heard the news that I had to give up my children, I cried bitterly. I have lived with them for 3 years. Why do they want to take my children away?"

Officials from the San Francisco Department of Social Public Affairs oppose "cross-cultural adoption." However, the department finds it difficult to find black couples willing to adopt black children. In this situation, the department requires white couples to hand over the black children to child care centers for upbringing. In fact, like other cities in the United States, San Francisco's child adoption care centers are already overcrowded, with an average of 60 children per caregiver. The child mortality rate in the centers is high. Three-quarters of the deaths are due to the biological parents' drug addiction.

Rena Matto adopted two black children, both of whom suffer from congenital diseases due to their parents' drug addiction. Later, under Matto's careful care, the children's health improved significantly. However, in late September, the local government department notified Matto that she should quickly send the two children to the care center. Matto is baffled by the government's actions.

Adoptive couples believe that the standard for adoption should be where the children are better off, and racial differences should not be an obstacle to adoption. They are not willing to give up their children and plan to seek legal assistance to challenge the government in court.

　　肤色隔断天伦情
    目前在美国，白人夫妇领养黑人儿童的人数在逐年增加，以旧金山为例，在今年领养的4200个儿童中，有70％是黑人儿童，而领养父母几乎全是白人。然而，许多地方政府不允许这种做法，要求白人夫妇交出他们领养的黑人儿童。这一决定激怒了白人夫妇。于是政府与白人夫妇之间产生了矛盾。白人妇女凯希·鲍琳，领养两个黑人儿童。最近旧金山社会公共事业部警告她，说因为种族差别，这种领养关系不能被承认。鲍琳痛苦地说：“当听到让我交出孩子的消息后，我痛哭流涕，我已经与他们在一起生活了3年。他们凭什么要带走我的孩子？”
    旧金山社会公共事业部的官员反对这种“跨文化领养”。然而，该部很难找到愿意领养黑人儿童的黑人夫妇。在这种情况下，该部要求白人夫妇将黑人儿童交儿童看护中心抚养。事实上如同美国其他城市一样，旧金山的领养儿童看护中心早已人满为患，平均每个护理人员要照看60名儿童。中心的儿童死亡率很高。有3／4的死亡是因为儿童的生身父母吸毒造成的。
    雷纳·玛托领养了两个黑人孩子，这两个孩子都因父母吸毒患有先天性疾病，后来在玛托的精心照料下，孩子们的身体有了明显好转。但是在9月底，当地政府部门通知玛托，她应该尽快把这两个孩子送到看护中心。玛托对政府的这种做法大惑不解。
    领养夫妇们认为，领养孩子的标准，应该是看孩子在哪里更好，种族差别不应该成为领养的障碍。他们不准备交出孩子，打算求助律师在法庭上与政府见高低。（李松）（附图片）
