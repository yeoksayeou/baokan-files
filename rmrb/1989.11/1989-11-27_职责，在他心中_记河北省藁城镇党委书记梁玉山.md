	**Duty in His Heart**
	**A Record of Liang Yushan, Party Secretary of Gaocheng Town, Hebei Province**

	Gao Wenhua, Mei Jianping

	In late September, Liang Yushan, the Party Secretary of Gaocheng Town in Hebei Province, returned from the Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai with a red certificate adorned with gold lettering, as one of the representatives of outstanding party workers nationwide honored by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

	Some say that Liang Yushan has been steadfast in strengthening party building since taking office five years ago, showing foresight; others say he is like a blind cat that stumbled upon a dead mouse. Liang Yushan believes: "I have merely fulfilled the duties that a Party Secretary should fulfill."

	**Searching for What Should Not Be Lost**

	In 1985, as rural reforms deepened, grassroots cadres focused their energies on finding projects, working, and doing business. Rural grassroots party organizations were virtually non-existent, and parts of Gaocheng Town fell into chaos with issues like non-compliance with procurement, non-payment of levies, over-plan births, illegal occupation of residential land, and frequent petitions and lawsuits. It was in this context that Liang Yushan was transferred to become the Party Secretary of Gaocheng Town, and the weight of anxiety and restlessness kept him awake many nights.

	What is our party organization doing? What are our party members doing? He rode his bicycle from village to village, searching for what should not be lost.

	After ten days of investigation, the problem was identified: out of 35 rural party branches, many were ineffective; 17 branches had cadres who only collected salaries without doing any work; 5 branches collectively resigned; some party members and cadres sought personal gain and embezzled collective and public interests; more than half of the town's party members were ineffective, and 29% of party members and cadres engaged in illegal and disorderly behavior such as seeking personal gain and violating family planning policies.

	Liang Yushan was shocked: it seemed that the responsibility system reaching the household level was not about not needing the party branch, but rather about needing the party branch more. As a Party Secretary, the duty is to stand at the height of overall planning and firmly grasp the fundamental task of party building.

	Under his leadership, the town party committee gradually shifted from focusing on specific economic projects to strategic economic development, and from taking over government work to concentrating mainly on party building.

	Over the past five years, the town party committee has held 74 party committee meetings, with 61 of them focused on party building and ideological and political work.

	**No Rules, No Order**

	In May 1986, shortly after the rural rectification campaign, the people of Meng Village reported that village cadres had embezzled collective property under the guise of developing collective enterprises. The investigation confirmed that 5 out of 7 branch committee members had embezzled and squandered 32,000 yuan of public funds.

	Liang Yushan discovered that after the rectification, many branches lacked a set of rules, and some party members and cadres had relaxed their self-discipline. Liang Yushan said at the party committee meeting, "Without rules, there is no order; without a system, the party cannot be managed."

	Based on the changing economic system, industrial layout, and production activities, Liang Yushan repeatedly convened party committee meetings to discuss and establish a series of systems, including the democratic evaluation of party members, party members' reports on benefits for the people, party members' responsibility areas, party member training, public supervision, and "bright spot" reporting meetings. He strove to make each system interlinked, complementary, and organically combined, integrating competition mechanisms, incentive mechanisms, and restraint mechanisms, using multiple methods to initially form a practical, systematic, and standardized party building system.

	Once the rules were established, strict implementation was key, starting with the leading cadres themselves. All regulations and systems in the town, including work and life regulations, were strictly followed by Liang Yushan. When the town office implemented the attendance roll-call system, the office staff, considering the leader's special status, often did not call the leader's name. Liang Yushan corrected this immediately upon noticing. From then on, whenever there was a collective activity, the secretary would always call "Liang Yushan" first, and he would always respond "Present" first.

	According to the Gaocheng Records, Gaocheng people have a long-standing habit of excessive drinking. However, the town party committee's work regulations stipulate that drinking is not allowed during work hours, and getting drunk during leisure time is not allowed. Last year, a town party committee deputy secretary went to the countryside for work and drank alcohol, and a deputy mayor behaved inappropriately after getting drunk. Liang Yushan showed no leniency, making them give self-criticisms at the town cadre meeting, and each had one quarter of their floating salary deducted. People were convinced, and no one dared to take the regulations lightly again.

	In 1987, a cadre working in Beijing obtained a plot of residential land in a village without approval. The town party committee ordered the demolition of the house, and this cadre, relying on connections, moved more than ten county-level leaders to intervene, and twice invited Liang Yushan to dinner to ask for leniency. However, Liang Yushan remained firm. Someone advised him, "Don't be so stubborn, you'll offend everyone." Liang Yushan said, "It depends on whether the regulations say it should be offended. The town party committee has regulations in place, and I will judge impartially."

	**The Secretary Should Be an Outstanding Party Member First**

	We asked Liang Yushan how to set an example as a Party Secretary. He opened the drawer of his desk and showed a stack of honor certificates. He has been evaluated as an outstanding Communist Party member for five consecutive years by the prefecture and county. Liang Yushan's words and deeds, though seemingly ordinary, reflect his unique personality. He embodies his deep understanding and strict self-discipline of the idea that "a Party Secretary should first be an outstanding party member."

	The town office regulations stipulate that cadres who are late, leave early, or absent from work will have their floating salary deducted. However, Liang Yushan arrives at work early every day, leaves late, and basically has no holidays or weekends.

	Gaocheng Town is a prosperous place for business. Several of Liang Yushan's relatives came to him, hoping he could help them get a plot of land for business, but all were rejected due to not meeting the conditions. Relatives invited Liang Yushan's father to apply "family law," but Liang Yushan calmly said, "The regulations are set by the collective, if I lead by breaking them, how can I ask others to follow, you wouldn't want others to point fingers at my back, would you!" The old man understood that his son was right and returned home happily.

	Under Liang Yushan's influence, resisting improper practices has become a conscious action for the town party committee. During the prevalent social practices of eating and drinking and exchanging favors, leaders from regional and higher-level departments visited Gaocheng Town more than twenty times to inspect and guide work, but they did not have a single banquet. More than a hundred cadres in the town office, from top to bottom, have not used their positions to seek personal gain. The town office of Gaocheng has become famous in the city as a "clean government office."

	Liang Yushan has found a successful path to strengthen party building in the wave of reform. The once obscure Gaocheng Town now has a strong party discipline, pure customs, developed economy, and the town and village-level party organizations and the broad masses of party members have become the core force for the construction of two civilizations in the town.

　　职责，在他心中
    ——记河北省藁城镇党委书记梁玉山
    高文华　梅建平
    9月下旬，河北省藁城市藁城镇党委书记梁玉山，作为受党中央表彰的全国优秀党务工作者代表之一，从中南海怀仁堂捧回了绸面嵌金字的大红奖励证书。
    有人说，梁玉山上任五年始终坚持抓党的建设，是有先见之明；也有人说，他是“瞎猫碰上死老鼠碰对了”。梁玉山认为：“我只是履行了一个党委书记应该履行的职责”。
              寻找不该失落的东西
    1985年，随着农村改革的不断深入，基层干部把精力都扑在找项目、务工、经商上面，农村基层党组织形同虚设，藁城镇部分农村出现了征购不交、提留不拿、超计划生育、宅基地乱占、上访告状不断的混乱现象。就是在这种情况下，梁玉山调任藁城镇党委书记，焦急、忧虑、不安压得他多少个深夜难以入眠。
    我们的党组织在干什么？我们的党员在干什么？他骑上自行车走村串户，去寻找那些不该失落的东西。
    经过十几天调查，症结找到了：35个农村党支部，竟有不少支部未起作用，17个支部的干部只拿俸禄不管事，5个支部集体提出辞职；还有一些党员干部见利忘义以权谋私，侵占集体和群众利益；全镇有半数以上的党员不能发挥作用，29％的党员、干部有以权谋私、违反计划生育政策等违法乱纪的行为。
      梁玉山震惊了：看来责任田到了户，并不是用不着党支部，而是更需要党支部。作为党委书记，职责就是站在统揽全局的高度，紧紧抓住党的建设这个根本。
      在他的带领下，党委一班人逐步由抓具体经济项目转到抓经济发展战略上来，由包办代替政府工作转到以主要精力抓党建上来。
      五年来，镇党委共召开党委会74次，其中研究党的建设和思想政治工作的会议就有61次。
                无规矩不成方圆
    1986年5月，农村整党刚刚结束，孟村群众检举反映村干部有借发展集体企业之名，侵吞集体财产的行为，经调查属实。该村7名支委中有5名共挪用挥霍公款32000元。
    梁玉山发现，整党之后，不少支部没有一套制度，有些党员干部放松了对自己的要求。梁玉山在党委会上说“无规矩不成方圆，没有制度就管不好党。”
    根据变化了的经济体制、产业格局和生产活动方式，梁玉山一次次地召集党委会讨论，先后建立健全了民主评议党员制度、党员为民谋利报告制度、党员责任区制度、党员培训制度、公开监督制度、“闪光点”报告会制度等一系列制度，并力求使每个制度互相衔接，互相配套，有机结合，融竞争机制、激励机制、约束机制于一体，多种手段并用，初步形成了一套实在可行、系统规范的党建制度体系。
    定了制度，要严格落实，关键在于领导干部从自身做起，带头执行。镇上所有规章制度，包括工作和生活制度，梁玉山都模范地遵守。镇机关实行考勤点名制度之初，办公室的同志考虑到领导的特殊性，往往不点领导的名，梁玉山发觉后立即纠正。打那以后，只要有集体活动，秘书总是第一个点“梁玉山”，他也总是第一个答“到”。
    据藁城志记载，藁城人素有酗酒嗜好，酗酒闹事习以为常。但镇党委的工作制度规定，上班时间不准喝酒，业余时间不准喝醉酒。去年，一位镇党委副书记下乡工作喝了酒，一位副镇长醉酒后失态。梁玉山毫不迁就，让他们在镇干部会上作了检查，每人被扣去一个季度的浮动工资。人们服气了，没人再敢把制度当儿戏。
    1987年，这个镇一个在北京工作的干部，未经批准私自在村里弄了块宅基地。镇党委令其拆房，这个干部凭借关系搬动十几个县局级领导出面，又两次设宴请梁玉山高抬贵手，可梁玉山软硬不吃。有人开导他：“别那么死心眼，人都要得罪光了。”梁玉山说：“那得凭制度看该不该得罪，镇党委有条文在先，我要秉公而断。”
              书记首先应该是优秀党员
    我们问过梁玉山，怎样树立党委书记的形象？他拉开办公桌的抽屉，亮出一摞荣誉证书。他已连续5年被地、县评为优秀共产党员了。梁玉山的一言一行，看似没有什么惊人之处，却有着鲜明的个性。在他身上，处处体现他对“党委书记首先应该是一名优秀党员”的深刻认识和严格自律。
    镇机关规定，干部上班迟到、早退和旷职都要扣罚浮动工资。而梁玉山一年到头，天天提前上班，下班最后离开，基本上没有节假日和星期天。
    藁城镇是经商的风水宝地。梁玉山的几个亲戚先后上门，想托他要块地皮做买卖，因不符合条件，都被他一一回绝。亲戚们请来梁玉山的父亲施“家法”，梁玉山心平气和地说：“制度是集体订的，我要是带头破坏了，还怎么说别人，你总不愿让别人戳我脊梁骨吧！”老人明白了儿子做得对，高兴而归。
    在梁玉山的带动下，抵制不正之风成了镇党委一班人的自觉行动。在社会上吃喝风、人情风盛行的时候，地区以上机关的领导先后二十几次到藁城镇检查、指导工作，他们硬是没摆过一桌酒席。机关大大小小百余名干部，无一人利用职权为自己谋私利。藁城镇机关成为全市有名的“清水衙门”。
    梁玉山在改革的浪潮中，摸索出了一条加强党的建设的成功之路。一向默默无闻的藁城镇，如今党风正、民风淳，经济发达，镇、村两级党组织和广大党员，已成为全镇两个文明建设的核心力量。
