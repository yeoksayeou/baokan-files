Unqualified Labels Flood the Food Market

Currently, unqualified labels are still rampant in the food market. Consumers strongly appeal to relevant departments to quickly come up with effective measures to fundamentally reverse the chaotic situation in the food market.

Recently, our bureau inspected the food labels of 32 retail enterprises in the commercial and supply and marketing systems of Longkou City. Out of 2798 food items, 1258 had labels that did not meet the labeling standards. All 32 enterprises had issues with unqualified food labels. Some enterprises had an unqualified label rate of over 80%. Among the food label categories, the alcohol labels had the lowest qualification rate. Except for beer labels, which had an 80% qualification rate, other alcohol labels had a 95% unqualified rate.

The food label issues are mainly reflected in two aspects:

First, the food labels are incomplete. They lack necessary information such as unclear or missing brand names, factory names and addresses, net weight, and solid content. They also do not specify the "three periods": production date, storage date, and shelf life (Note: In May 1987, the National Bureau of Standards issued the "General Standard for Food Labels," stipulating that packaged food labels must include the product name, factory name, production date, expiration date, and ingredients).

Second, the content of the food labels does not match the actual product. Some people, when making food labels, exaggerate the factory size, fame, main ingredients, and nutritional value, aiming to pass off inferior products as superior ones, deceiving consumers.

Food is an essential item in people's daily lives and directly affects health and safety. Food labels provide information about the food and reflect its performance, making it convenient for consumers to understand, purchase, and consume food. However, if food labels are chaotic, they cannot fully, accurately, and effectively play their intended role. This not only fails to guide consumption but also harms consumer interests and even threatens their health and safety.

It is worth noting that the 32 enterprises inspected this time in our city are all state-owned and collective enterprises, with a considerable proportion being "trusted units for prices and measurements."

What about the labeling situation of individual stalls and units that are not "trusted units for prices and measurements"?

The food labels inspected this time include those from local sources as well as from other provinces and cities, indicating that the food labeling issue is a widespread problem. The sampling results published by the Shandong Provincial Bureau of Standards show that only 30% of packaged food labels in the production and circulation sectors in the province meet the requirements, and only 17% of packaged food labels produced by individual households meet the requirements. Recently, the sampling results published by the State Bureau of Technical Supervision on CCTV show that less than 10% of packaged food labels meet the requirements, and the problem is quite serious.

We hope that all levels of relevant departments and the entire society will pay high attention to the food labeling issue, strengthen supervision and management, protect consumer interests, and ensure the health and safety of the people.

### 不合格标签充斥食品市场

　　不合格标签充斥食品市场
    目前，不合格标签仍充斥食品市场、广大消费者强烈呼吁有关部门尽快拿出有效办法，从根本上扭转食品市场混乱局面。
    前不久，我局对龙口市商业、供销系统32家经销企业的食品标签进行了检查，2798种食品中，有1258种食品的标签不符合标签标准规定。32家企业无一不存在食品标签不合格问题。少数企业食品标签不合格率达80％以上。从食品标签类别看，酒类标签合格率最低，除啤酒标签合格率达80％外，其它酒类标签不合格率竟达95％。
    食品标签问题突出表现在两个方面：
    一是食品标签内容残缺不全。标志不全或标志不清，不标厂名和厂址，不标净重含量及固形物含量，不标“三期”，即生产日期、保存日期和保质日期（按：1987年5月，国家标准局颁布
  《食品标签通用标准》，规定包装食品的标签上必须写明品名、厂名、生产日期、有效期、成分等内容）；
    二是食品标签内容名实不符。一些人在制作食品标签时，厂家越大越好、越出名越好，主要成份营养价值越高越好、越珍奇越好，以达到以次充好、以假乱真，欺骗消费者的目的。
    食品是人们日常生活中不可缺少的消费品，它直接牵涉到人身健康、生命安全问题。食品标签是对食品的一种说明，也直观地反映食品性能，为消费者了解、选购和食用食品提供方便。食品标签混乱，难以全面、准确、有效地发挥应有的作用，不仅达不到指导消费的目的，反而侵害了消费者利益，甚至对消费者的健康、生命安全构成威胁。
    值得注意的是，我市这次检查的32个企业都是国营、集体企业，其中，“物价、计量信得过单位”占相当比例。
    那么，那些个体摊点、那些非“物价、计量信得过单位”的食品标签状况是什么样子呢？
    这次检查的食品标签有来自当地的，也有来自别的省、市的，这说明食品标签问题是个普遍存在的问题。山东省标准计量局公布的抽查结果是：全省生产和流通领域的包装食品标签符合要求的仅30％，个体户生产的包装食品标签符合要求的仅占17％。最近，中央电视台公布的国家技术监督局抽查结果，包装食品标签符合要求的不足10％，问题相当严重。
    希望各级主管部门及全社会高度重视食品标签问题，切实加强监督管理，维护消费者的利益，保证人民群众的健康、安全。
