Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 20th.

Full mobilization, momentum strong. 40 million workers engage in winter water conservancy construction, and a high tide of water conservancy projects is sweeping the country this winter.

The winter agricultural water conservancy construction in China has gradually entered a high tide. Currently, 40 million workers are actively engaged in water conservancy projects across the country, creating the best momentum for winter water conservancy construction in recent years.

According to the Ministry of Water Resources, by the end of October, the country had invested 500 million labor days in water conservancy projects, more than double the amount from the same period last year. Additionally, 8 million mu of irrigation area has been newly increased, restored, or improved, a 60% increase compared to the same period last year. Drainage areas totaling 3 million mu have been established, 1.8 million mu of saline-alkali and waterlogged low-yield fields have been transformed, and 2,700 square kilometers of soil erosion have been treated.

Since the autumn, especially after the State Council's decision to vigorously promote agricultural water conservancy basic construction was issued, local party and government leaders have actively mobilized and deployed agricultural water conservancy basic construction work. Beijing, Tianjin, Anhui, Shaanxi, and Fujian provinces and municipalities have established agricultural water conservancy construction command headquarters or leading groups. Most counties in Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hebei, and Shandong provinces have also established agricultural water conservancy construction command headquarters led by government officials. Henan Province has decided that all sectors should work together to support water conservancy construction and has included water conservancy construction in the term targets of governments at all levels.

The funds allocated for agricultural water conservancy construction this year have significantly increased compared to last year. Shandong Province has decided to allocate 315 million yuan for agricultural water conservancy construction this winter and next spring, with 1.4 billion yuan already collected by various levels of finance and 2.8 billion yuan raised by the masses. Hubei, Guangdong, and Anhui provinces have each increased their financial allocations for agricultural water conservancy construction by more than 100 million yuan compared to last year. Guizhou Province, despite financial difficulties, has allocated 200 million yuan from both the provincial and local governments for water conservancy construction this winter and next spring.

This year, various regions have acted quickly and mobilized the masses extensively in winter water conservancy construction. Liaoning Province began construction in late September, with a peak of over 2 million workers. Hebei Province's ongoing and completed projects are three times those of last year, and the labor days invested in water conservancy construction are five times those of the same period last year. Sichuan Province's labor days invested are more than three times those of the same period last year.

In winter water conservancy construction this year, various regions have emphasized local conditions and focused on improving the benefits of water conservancy projects. The three northeastern provinces and Shandong, which suffered severe droughts this year, have focused on anti-drought and water conservation, making full use of existing water sources, intercepting surface water, rationally developing groundwater, and promoting water-saving measures. Zhejiang, Fujian, and Hainan provinces, which have experienced severe floods and typhoons, have focused on repairing water-damaged projects and quickly restoring the benefits of existing water conservancy facilities.

    发动充分　势头良好
    四千万民工齐上阵  今冬修水利掀高潮
    新华社北京电　（记者赵鹏、通讯员贾庭欣）我国今年冬季农田水利建设现已逐渐进入高潮，目前已有4000万民工奋战在各地水利工地上，形成了近年来冬季兴修水利的最好势头。
    据水利部今天提供情况，截至10月底，全国已投入水利劳动积累工5亿个，为去年同期的2倍多；新增、恢复、改善灌溉面积800多万亩，比去年同期增加60％，除涝面积300万亩，改造盐碱、渍害低产田180万亩，治理水土流失面积2700平方公里。
    今年入秋以来，特别是国务院《关于大力开展农田水利基本建设的决定》下达后，各地党政领导积极动员部署农田水利基本建设工作。北京、天津、安徽、陕西、福建等省市成立了农田水利建设指挥部或领导小组；江苏、江西、河北、山东等省的大部分地县也成立了由政府主要负责人任指挥的农田水利建设指挥部。河南省作出决定，要求各行各业齐心协力支持水利建设，并把水利建设列入了各级政府的任期目标。
    各地今年用于农田水利建设的资金比上年有较大幅度增加。山东省决定今冬明春省市县用于农田水利建设的资金要达到3.15亿元，目前全省各级财政已筹集资金1.4亿元，群众自筹资金2.8亿元；湖北、广东、安徽省财政用于农田水利建设的资金比去年均增加了1000万元以上；贵州省在财政困难的情况下，由省里和地方各拿出2000万元资金用于今冬明春水利建设。
    今年各地在冬修水利中行动快，群众发动充分。辽宁省9月下旬就开始行动，最高出工200多万；河北省目前开工、完工的项目都是去年的3倍，投入水利劳动积累工是去年同期的5倍；四川省投入工日是去年同期的3倍多。
    各地在今年冬修水利中，注重因地制宜，以提高水利工程效益为主。今年受旱严重的东北三省和山东省以抗旱保水为中心，充分利用现有水源，拦蓄地表水，合理开发地下水，大力推行节约用水；洪涝、台风灾害较重的浙江、福建、海南等省则以修复水毁工程为重点，尽快恢复现有水利设施的效益。
