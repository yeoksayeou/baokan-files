The central government has emphasized the need to strengthen agriculture and stabilize rural policies. Five provinces—Hunan, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Gansu, and Qinghai—have reported bumper harvests this year.

Hunan

According to Xinhua News Agency in Changsha on November 3, Hunan Province's relevant departments predict that this year's total grain production will exceed 26.5 billion kilograms, an increase of 1.15 billion kilograms over last year, breaking the cycle of stagnation over the past five years.

It is understood that Hunan Province achieved increased production in early, middle, and late rice seasons this year. Regionally, only a few areas experienced reduced yields due to disasters.

Jiangxi

According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanchang on November 6, Jiangxi Province, during its rectification and reorganization, has prioritized agriculture in its industrial development sequence, strengthened leadership, implemented policies, and increased investments. This has enabled the province to overcome severe floods and achieve overall growth in agriculture.

Currently, Jiangxi's autumn harvest is nearing completion, and the agricultural production situation is basically set. The provincial government's recent analysis and forecast indicate:

Crop production has rapidly recovered and developed—annual grain production is expected to reach 15.6 billion kilograms, potentially reaching a historical high after actual measurement; cotton production is expected to reach 1.1 million piculs, a 65% increase over last year; oilseed production is expected to reach 10.35 million piculs, setting a historical high; fruit, tea, tobacco, and cocoon production have all surpassed historical highs; sugarcane and hemp production have exceeded last year's levels.

Livestock production maintains a good growth momentum—with the pig inventory matching last year's levels, 12 million head of market-ready pigs are expected, a 2.7% increase over last year; the year-end cattle and sheep inventories are expected to reach historical highs; meat production is expected to exceed 1 million metric tons for the first time.

Aquaculture has created a new record on the basis of 10 consecutive years of increased production—annual aquatic product production is expected to grow by 7% compared to last year.

The province's total agricultural output value is expected to reach 1.165 billion yuan, a 5% increase over last year; per capita net income for farmers is expected to increase by 60 to 70 yuan compared to last year.

Yunnan

According to Xinhua News Agency in Kunming on November 3, most prefectures and counties in Yunnan Province have reported bumper grain harvests. The provincial authorities predict that this year's total grain production will reach 9.75 billion kilograms, a 3.6% increase over last year, making it the second-highest harvest year after 1984.

Gansu

According to Xinhua News Agency in Lanzhou on November 6, Gansu Province has reported good news: this year's total grain production is expected to exceed 6.2 billion kilograms, an increase of 3 billion kilograms over the historical high of last year. This is the seventh consecutive year of stable grain production growth since 1983, marking the province's entry into a phase of stable grain production increases.

Grain shortages have long been a major issue affecting Gansu's economic development and social stability. In the past, despite financial difficulties, the province had to spend hundreds of millions of yuan to import over 6 billion kilograms of grain annually to solve the food problem for its people. The provincial party committee and government have deepened their understanding of the principle that "agriculture is the foundation" and "food security ensures stability" through practice. They have consistently placed agriculture at the forefront of stabilizing the overall situation and at the core of all work. Provincial leaders and local party and government heads have personally overseen agricultural and grain production, maintained and improved rural policies, protected and motivated farmers' enthusiasm for grain production, and promoted stable grain production growth throughout the province.

Qinghai

According to a reporter from the People's Daily in Xining on November 6, the sampling survey results from Qinghai Province's Statistics Bureau indicate that the province's total grain production this year reached 1.1072 billion kilograms, setting a historical high. The total oilseed production was 110.5 million kilograms. Grain and oil production increased by 4.63% and 5.72% respectively compared to last year.

Qinghai has been a grain-deficient province for many years. To reduce the burden on the state, the provincial party committee and government have strengthened leadership over agricultural production this year. They have increased agricultural investments in agricultural areas, semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, and state farms, carried out large-scale agricultural development, implemented scientific and technological contracts, and strived for breakthroughs in grain production. The provincial finance department invested 20 million yuan in land development despite financial difficulties, and the financial sector increased loan issuance by 50 million yuan compared to last year. The per capita investment by rural households in planting reached 38.74 yuan, a 37.3% increase over last year.

    大力加强农业　稳定农村政策
    湘赣滇陇青五省粮食丰收
    湖南
    据新华社长沙11月3日电  （记者杨善清）湖南省有关部门预计，今年全省粮食总产量可超过265亿公斤，比去年增产11.5亿公斤，摆脱了连续5年徘徊的局面。
    据了解，湖南省今年实现了早稻、中稻、晚稻季季增产，从区域上看，仅有个别地区因灾减产。
    江西
    据新华社南昌11月6日电  （记者刘小宁）江西省在治理整顿中以国家制定的当前产业政策要点为导向，真正把农业排在各产业发展序列的首位，加强领导，落实政策，增加投入，使全省农业战胜严重洪涝灾害，获得全面增长。
    目前，江西农作物秋收已接近尾声，农业生产基本定局，省政府近日分析预测的结果是：
    种植业迅速恢复发展——全年粮食总产量可达156亿公斤，实打后可望达到历史最高水平；棉花总产110万担，比去年增长65％；油料总产量1035万担，创历史最高水平；水果、茶叶、烟叶、蚕茧总产均超历史最高水平；甘蔗、黄红麻产量超过去年。
    畜牧业保持较好增长势头——生猪在存栏量与去年持平的基础上，可出栏肉猪1200万头，比去年增长2.7％；牛、羊年末存栏量均可创历史最高水平；肉类年总产量第一次突破100万吨。
    水产业在连续10年增产的基础上再创新纪录——全年水产品总量预计可比上年增长7％。
    全省农业总产值预计可达116.5亿元，比上年增长5％；农民人均纯收入比去年可增加60至70元。
    云南
    据新华社昆明11月3日电  （记者马天泽）云南省绝大多数地（州）、县频频传来粮食丰收的喜讯。省主管部门预计全省今年粮食总产量可达97.5亿公斤，比去年增产3.6％，为历史上仅次于1984年的第二个丰收年。
    甘肃
    据新华社兰州11月6日电  （记者王云峰）甘肃省传来喜讯：今年粮食总产量预计可超过62亿公斤，比历史产粮最高年份的去年增加3亿公斤。这是甘肃省自1983年起粮食稳定增长的第7个年头，标志着全省粮食生产已步入稳定增产的阶段。
    粮食短缺一直是影响甘肃经济发展和社会稳定的大问题。过去在财政困难的情况下，为了解决全省人民的吃饭问题，每年要花上亿元从省外调进6亿多公斤粮食。“农业是基础”，“有粮则稳”，甘肃省委和省政府从实践中不断加深对此方针的认识，始终把农业摆在稳定全省大局的首要位置和各项工作的中心地位，省主要领导和各级党政“一把手”亲自抓农业、抓粮食，坚持稳定和完善农村各项政策，保护并调动农民种粮的积极性，促进了全省粮食生产的稳定增长。
    青海
    本报西宁11月6日电  记者郅振璞报道：青海省统计局的抽样调查实测结果表明：全省今年粮食总产量达11.072亿公斤，创历史最高水平。油料总产量1.105亿公斤。粮、油分别比去年增长4.63％、5.72％。
    青海是多年来的缺粮省，为减轻国家负担，省委、省政府今年切实加强对农业生产的领导，在农业区、半农半牧区和各国营农场增加农业投入，大搞农田开发，实行科技承包，力争粮食生产有突破性进展。省财政在十分困难情况下为土地开发投资2000万元，金融部门筹资放贷总额也比去年增加5000万元。全省农户人均投资种植业的支出38.74元，比去年增长37.3％。
