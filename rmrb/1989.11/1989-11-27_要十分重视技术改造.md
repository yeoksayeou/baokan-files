The issue of how state-owned large-scale old enterprises can, through reform and opening up, develop new and high technologies, carry out technological transformation, and move towards modernization and the international market is a major concern for anyone who cares about China's future and destiny. How to address this issue can be enlightening for readers from the book "The Great Transformation of Anshan Iron and Steel."

The chief editor of the book, Comrade Shen Yue, has long been involved in economic leadership work and spent most of the 1970s working at Anshan Iron and Steel. He is a dedicated, experienced, and theoretically well-versed senior comrade who, even during his period of medical leave, personally conducted investigations and summarized the experiences of Anshan Iron and Steel's reform, opening up, and technological transformation. He wrote the "Investigation Report on Anshan Iron and Steel's Development of an Outward-Oriented Economy." Now, he has also edited the book "The Great Transformation of Anshan Iron and Steel," summarizing the achievements and changes of Anshan Iron and Steel since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. This has important significance for revitalizing large enterprises, transforming old enterprises, developing an outward-oriented economy, and moving towards modernization.

Anshan Iron and Steel is the largest steel and iron combined enterprise in the country, built during the recovery period and the first Five-Year Plan after the founding of New China. It plays a crucial role in the national economy and has made significant contributions to China's socialist construction. However, what role does it play today in implementing the coastal economic development strategy, and what potential does it have?

For Anshan Iron and Steel, the Sixth Five-Year Plan period starting in 1981 was a critical period. Before the Sixth Five-Year Plan, it was a typical closed, inward-looking product economic management model, adhering to old practices and being self-satisfied, which gradually robbed Anshan Iron and Steel of its vitality and put it in a dire situation where it would become a pile of scrap metal if not transformed soon. Since the Sixth Five-Year Plan, Anshan Iron and Steel has seriously implemented the party's reform and opening-up policies, undergoing fundamental changes from a closed to an open system, "moving out of the valley of product economy and sailing into the ocean of commodity economy," and finding a new path for large old enterprises to modernize and develop an outward-oriented economy.

The basic experiences of Anshan Iron and Steel during this period are twofold: First, through reform, establish a new mechanism for socialist commodity economy, making the enterprise full of new vitality, relying on self-accumulation, self-transformation, and self-development to achieve modernization; second, through opening up, establish a new mechanism for external operations, carry out compensatory trade, earn foreign exchange through exports, introduce foreign capital, introduce technology, update technological equipment, expand production capacity, improve quality, increase varieties, improve product structure, and enhance economic benefits. Comrade Shen Yue's work proposes a very important viewpoint: to take the road of reform and opening up to revitalize enterprises, transform old enterprises, and achieve modernization. This is not only a major issue with directional significance for the development of the steel industry but also for the transformation of old enterprises in other industries. Because, in order to adapt to the needs of the Four Modernizations, China has a large number of old enterprises facing similar technological transformation tasks as "Anshan Iron and Steel." Currently, the country's funds are limited, and it is not practical to rely solely on state investment to complete this large-scale technological transformation task as in the past. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the transformation to activate the enterprise, carry out self-accumulation, and gradually carry out technological transformation to achieve modernization. The book explains with detailed figures that since 1981, the total investment in technological transformation of Anshan Iron and Steel has reached tens of billions of yuan, most of which is self-raised. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, the total investment was 1.7 billion yuan, and except for the state's investment of 198 million yuan in mine transformation, all other funds were raised by Anshan Iron and Steel through the full use of national policies. By 1988, it had formed an annual production capacity of 8 million tons of steel. The author predicts that by the early 1990s, it will form a production capacity of 10 million tons, and by the end of the century, it may form a production capacity of 15 million tons. If so, based on the Sixth Five-Year Plan, it will achieve a doubling of production capacity, a quadrupling of profits and taxes, and a more than tenfold increase in export earnings, significantly improving economic benefits. This is encouraging.

For such a key state-owned enterprise as Anshan Iron and Steel, with more than 90% of its products being planned products and most of its products being sold domestically, how can it implement the coastal economic development strategy and develop an outward-oriented economy? Anshan Iron and Steel's experience is: adapting to the new situation of the coastal economic development strategy, the key to developing an outward-oriented economy is: in technological transformation, vigorously develop export and import substitution products. Currently, the proportion of Anshan Iron and Steel's direct exports is not large, mainly through technological transformation, including directly using foreign capital for technological transformation, forming new production capacity for new varieties, developing import substitution products. In recent years, China has imported an average of more than 18 million tons of steel annually, spending a huge amount of foreign exchange to solve the steel needed for China's production and construction, exceeding China's foreign exchange and fiscal capacity to bear, which is unsustainable. Therefore, developing import substitution products, easing the contradiction in the domestic market demand, reducing the import of steel and the foreign exchange spent, the ultimate goal is to fundamentally improve China's competitiveness in the international market. In this sense, this is also an outward-oriented economy.

After reading Comrade Shen Yue's work and the articles by the leaders of Anshan Iron and Steel, we have reason to believe that Anshan Iron and Steel will definitely become a new base for the Four Modernizations and make new contributions to the implementation of the coastal economic development strategy!

There have always been two different views on whether to rely on the transformation of old enterprises like Anshan Iron and Steel or to rely solely on the construction of new steel enterprises to develop China's steel industry. Practice has proven that after China's industry has developed to a certain extent, if expanded reproduction still mainly relies on increasing many new basic construction projects and neglecting the technological transformation of existing enterprises, it is not advisable and does not conform to China's current national conditions. It should mainly rely on technological transformation to give full play to the role of existing enterprises to expand reproduction. This is a new path to develop China's productive forces quickly, efficiently, and economically, and is a new strategy for developing China's socialist economy. This book fully explains this important viewpoint.

Comrade Shen Yue's book also raises the important strategic issue of old enterprises and old industrial bases preparing necessary measures during their technological and resource peak periods to prevent decline. Some industrial areas and large enterprises in old capitalist countries have experienced or are experiencing the process from prosperity to decline. Britain, Germany, the United States, and even Japan have such experiences. Through the establishment of Sino-foreign joint ventures and horizontal alliances, the development of high-tech and new technology industries, although it has just begun, is far-sighted and full of vitality. We should not repeat the path that capitalist countries have already taken, so we should learn from the current experiences of capitalist countries, starting from now, fully utilizing various favorable conditions at present, taking high-tech and new technology industries as the vanguard, developing economic advantages, making old industrial bases into new technology industry bases, and becoming the main pillar of China's high-tech and new technology development.

The investigation report by Comrade Shen Yue and the basic experiences included in the book "The Great Transformation of Anshan Iron and Steel" have universal significance for China's old enterprises to achieve modernization. Especially in Liaoning and the Northeast region, most of the large old enterprises were built during the First and Second Five-Year Plans, and their application value is greater. Comrade Shen Yue and the leaders of Anshan Iron and Steel, with their many years of practice and the understanding gained from practice, thoroughly observe and analyze the various factors of Anshan Iron and Steel's changes in the report and articles, proposing several important and eye-catching viewpoints. These viewpoints are worth deep consideration for comrades in charge of economic work, comrades engaged in theoretical research work, and entrepreneurs. Studying these experiences is very beneficial for old enterprises and large enterprises to carry out technological transformation through reform and opening up, improve economic benefits, achieve modernization, and move towards the international market.

### 要十分重视技术改造

　　要十分重视技术改造
　　马洪
    国营大型老企业，如何通过改革、开放，发展新技术、高技术，进行技术改造，走向现代化，走向国际市场，这是每个关心我国发展前途和命运的人，都十分重视的大问题。怎样解决这个问题，读者从《鞍钢巨变》一书中，可以得到有益的启发。
    本书的主编沈越同志，长期从事经济领导工作，70年代大部时间在鞍钢工作。他是一位热衷事业、经验丰富并有一定理论修养的老同志，在病休之际，亲自调查总结鞍钢的改革、开放与技术改造的经验，写出了《关于鞍钢发展外向型经济的调查报告》。现在他又主编了《鞍钢巨变》一书，总结了党的十一届三中全会十年来，鞍钢发展的成就和变化。这对于大企业搞活，老企业技术改造，发展外向型经济，迈向现代化，具有重要的意义。
    鞍钢是新中国成立后，经过恢复时期和第一个五年计划时期改建起来的全国最大钢铁联合企业，在国民经济发展中处于举足轻重的地位，曾经对我国的社会主义建设做出过巨大贡献。那么，它在今天贯彻执行沿海经济发展战略中具有什么地位和可能发挥什么作用呢？
    对于鞍钢来说，从1981年开始的第六个五年计划时期是一个关键时期。在“六五”之前，它是一个典型的封闭式内向型的产品经济管理模式，因循守旧，固步自封，使鞍钢逐渐丧失生机与活力，面临“再不改造若干年后将成为一堆废铁”的绝境。“六五”以来，鞍钢认真贯彻执行党的改革开放方针，发生了根本性的变化，从封闭走向开放，“走出了产品经济的峡谷，驶向商品经济的海洋”，走出了一条大型老企业走向现代化，发展外向型经济的新路子。
    这一时期鞍钢的基本经验有两条：第一，通过改革，建立社会主义商品经济新机制，使企业具有新的活力，依靠自我积累，自我改造，自我发展，实现现代化；第二，通过开放建立对外经营新机制，开展补偿贸易，出口创汇，引进外资，引进技术，更新技术装备，扩大生产能力，提高质量，增加品种，改善产品结构，提高经济效益。沈越同志的著作，提出了一个极其重要的观点：要走改革开放搞活企业，改造老企业，实现现代化的道路。这不仅对于发展钢铁工业，而且对于其他行业老企业的改造，都是一个带有方向性的大问题。因为适应四个现代化发展的需要，我国有大批老企业都面临着类似“鞍钢”那样的技术改造的任务，而目前国家的资金有限，像过去那样，单靠国家投资来完成这项大规模的技术改造任务，实际上是办不到的。因此，必须依靠在改造的基础上，把企业放活，进行自我积累，逐步进行技术改造，实现现代化。本书以翔实数字阐明：1981年以来的8年中，鞍钢技术改造总投资额达三十几亿元，大部分是自筹的。“六五”期间总投资额为17亿元，国家除给矿山改造投资1.98亿元以外，其余全部资金依靠鞍钢充分运用国家给予的政策自筹。到1988年已经形成年产800万吨钢的综合生产能力。作者预计，到90年代初，将形成1000万吨生产能力，本世纪末可能形成1500万吨生产能力。如果这样，在“六五”的基础上将实现生产能力翻一番，利税翻两番，出口创汇增长10倍以上，经济效益明显提高。这是令人鼓舞的。
    对于鞍钢这样的国家重点企业，指令性计划产品占90％以上，绝大部分产品用于内销，如何贯彻执行沿海经济发展战略，发展外向型经济呢？鞍钢的经验是：适应沿海经济发展战略的新形势，发展外向型经济的关键是：在技术改造中大力发展出口和进口替代产品。鞍钢目前直接出口的产品比例不大，主要是通过技术改造，包括直接利用外资进行技术改造，形成新的生产新品种的能力，发展进口替代产品。近几年来，我国每年平均进口1800多万吨钢材，花费巨额外汇来解决我国生产建设所需的钢材，超出了我国外汇和财政可能的承担能力，这是难以为继的。因此，发展替代进口的产品，缓解国内市场的需求矛盾，减少进口钢材及所花费的外汇，其目的还是从根本上提高我国在国际市场上的竞争能力。从这个意义上说，这样也是外向型经济。
    看了沈越同志的著作和鞍钢领导同志的文章，我们有理由相信，鞍钢一定能够成为四个现代化的新基地，并为实现沿海经济发展战略做出新贡献！
    是依靠改造鞍钢这样的老企业，还是只靠建设新的钢铁企业来发展我国的钢铁工业，从来就有两种不同的主张。实践证明，在我国工业已经有了相当程度的发展之后，扩大再生产如果仍然主要依靠增加许多新的基本建设项目，忽视对现有企业的技术改造，是不可取的，也不符合我国当前国情。应当主要通过技术改造，充分发挥现有企业的作用来扩大再生产。这是一条多快好省地发展我国生产力的新路子，是发展我国社会主义经济的一项新战略。本书就充分阐明了这个重要观点。
    沈越同志的书还提出了老企业、老工业基地，要在它的技术、资源的鼎盛时期就要预作必要的准备，防止衰落这个发展战略的重要问题。老牌的资本主义国家的一些工业区和大型企业都有过而且有的正在经历着从鼎盛到衰落的过程，英国、德国、美国以至日本的一些老工矿区，都有这种经历。通过举办中外合资、横向联合发展高技术和新技术产业，尽管它是刚刚开始，但这是富有远见和生命力的。我们不应该重复资本主义国家已经走过的历程，那就要吸取当今资本主义国家的经验，从现在开始，充分利用现时的各种有利条件，以高技术和新技术产业为先导，发展经济优势，使老工业基地成为新技术产业基地，成为我国高技术、新技术的主要发展支柱。
    沈越同志的调查报告和列入《鞍钢巨变》这本书的基本经验，对于我国的老企业如何实现现代化，是有着普遍的意义。特别是在辽宁及东北地区大型的老企业多半是第一、二个五年计划时期建设起来的，它的应用价值更大。沈越同志和鞍钢的领导同志们以其多年的实践，以及从实践中所取得的认识，在报告和文章中透彻地观察与分析了鞍钢的变化的各种因素，提出了令人注目的若干重要观点，这种观点，无论是担任经济工作领导的同志，还是从事理论研究工作的同志，还是企业家，都值得深思。研究这些经验，对于老企业、大企业通过改革开放，进行技术改造，提高经济效益，实现现代化，走向国际市场是很有益的。
