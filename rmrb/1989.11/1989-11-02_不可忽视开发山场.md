	The Importance of Developing Mountainous Areas
	Wang Genbao, Secretary of the Communist Party of China in Lincheng County, Hebei Province

	Our county of Lincheng in Hebei Province is located at the eastern foot of the Taihang Mountains. The average farmland per person in rural areas is 2.1 mu, and the average mountainous area per person is 4.6 mu. In the past few years, the development of mountainous areas has almost been forgotten by people, and the phenomenon of "dividing but not managing" is widespread in the mountains allocated to households. In people's eyes, it seems that only farmland is considered "land," while mountainous areas are not.

	Why do farmers, who have always valued land as precious as gold, treat mountainous areas with such indifference? According to investigations and analyses, there are four objective reasons: For a period, some leading cadres were confused by the successive phenomena of surplus labor, local difficulties in selling grain, and selling cotton, emphasizing only the transfer of labor and not encouraging development; the price "scissors difference" between industrial and agricultural products was too large, making farmers feel that development-oriented production was not profitable; in the initial stage of allocation, the policy was not perfect, only considering the balance of distribution and not considering the scale effect, resulting in scattered plots that were difficult to manage; the supporting services were not in place, and problems such as seedlings and technology were difficult to solve.

	Of course, there are also subjective reasons: First, farmers have a psychological fear of change, worrying that if the policy changes, it will result in "the previous person planting trees, and the next person enjoying the shade." Second, they are constrained by the ideology of small-scale farming. Some farmers pay more attention to immediate benefits and are willing to take risks to work and do business to gain immediate benefits, rather than engage in development-oriented agricultural production that may take three to five years to see results.

	In Lincheng County, where farmland is scarce and mountainous areas are vast, guiding farmers to increase labor, capital, and technological inputs into mountainous areas is obviously crucial to revitalizing the rural economy. The county party committee and government have conducted multiple in-depth investigations in mountainous and hilly areas, analyzing and researching from both positive and negative aspects, and even inviting experts for verification. The conclusion is that increasing investment in the development of mountainous areas can not only develop and transform natural resources but also has a significant impact on improving the ecological environment and absorbing surplus rural labor.

	Therefore, the county party committee and government have formulated industry-inclined policies to mobilize farmers' enthusiasm for developing mountainous areas. Aiming at the objective reality that development-oriented production has a long cycle and slow results, and the subjective reality that farmers are concerned about policy changes and immediate benefits, they have implemented six incentive policies: "Who develops, who benefits." The contracted wasteland and hills generally have a contract period of 20-30 years. During the contract period, the contractor has the right to independent operation, product pricing, discounted transfer, and inheritance by descendants. Those with good overall management effects can extend the contract period after expiration; for large investment, long cycle, and slow results management projects, the contract fee is reduced or not collected in the first 2-3 years; for mountainous areas with good management effects, low-interest loans, special funds subsidies, and material support are given priority; the water wells, ditches, ponds, orchards, and other facilities built by the contractor can be charged, leased, or transferred. Each township (town) has also formulated some preferential measures according to local conditions.

	The inclined policies have mobilized farmers' enthusiasm for developing mountainous areas. Since 1986, the total investment in the development of mountainous areas in the county has reached more than 25 million yuan, with a total of 3.31 million workdays invested, and the treatment area has reached 353,000 mu. In Lincheng, farmers have begun to manage mountainous areas as carefully as they do farmland.

### 不可忽视开发山场

    不可忽视开发山场
    中共河北临城县委书记　王根保
    我们河北省临城县地处太行山东麓，全县农村人均2.1亩耕地，人均山场4.6亩。前几年，山场开发几乎成为被人们“遗忘的角落”，分包到户的自留山、责任山，“分而不治”现象普遍存在。在人们眼中，好像只有耕地是“地”，山场不算“地”。
    一惯惜土如金的农民，为什么对山场如此冷淡呢？据调查分析，客观原因有四个：在一个时期内，一些领导干部被相继出现的劳力过剩、局部的卖粮难、卖棉难现象所迷惑，只强调转移，不鼓励开发；工农业产品价格“剪刀差”过大，使农民感到搞开发性生产无利可图；分包初期政策不尽完善，只考虑到分配平衡，没有考虑到规模效益，造成地块分散不好经营；服务工作不配套，种苗、技术等问题难以解决。
    当然，也有主观原因：其一是农民思想上存在“惧变”心理，担心政策一旦变化，造成“前人栽树，后人乘凉”。其二是受小农思想意识束缚。一些农民比较注重实惠和眼前利益，宁可冒风险去务工经商现得实惠，而不愿去搞三年五年才可能见效的开发性农业生产。
    在耕地较少，山场广阔的临城县，引导农民增加对山场的劳务、资金、技术投入，显然对振兴农村经济至关重要。县委、县政府多次深入山区丘陵调查，从正反两方面分析研究，还聘请专家论证，得出结论是，增加开发山场投入，不仅能使自然资源得到开发和转化，而且对改善生态环境有巨大作用，还能吸纳农村剩余劳动力。
    于是，县委、县政府对症下药，制定产业倾斜政策，调动农民开发山场积极性。针对开发性生产周期长、见效慢的客观实际和农民担心政策变、重实惠的主观现实，实行了“谁开发谁受益”的六项鼓励性政策：分包到户的荒山丘陵承包期一般为20—30年，承包期内，承包者有自主经营权、产品定价权、折价转让权、后代继承权。整体治理效果好的，期满后可延长承包期；对投资大、周期长、见效慢的治理项目，在承包的前2—3年，少收或不收承包费；对治理山场、改造低产田和兴建较大型水利工程效益好的，优先给予低息贷款、专项资金补助和物料扶持；承包者新建的水井、沟渠、坑塘、果园等工程设施，可收费、租赁、转让。各乡（镇）也根据本地情况制定了一些优惠措施。
    倾斜政策调动了农民开发山场的积极性。1986年以来，全县投入山场开发资金总计达250多万元，投入工日331万多个，治理面积共达35.3万亩。在临城，农民开始把山场也当“土地”一样精心经营了。
