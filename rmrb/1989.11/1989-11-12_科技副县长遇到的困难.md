    Since March 1988, Hubei Province has gradually appointed science and technology deputy county (city) magistrates for its 74 counties (cities). According to relevant departments, these officials have, over the past year, introduced scientific and technological advancements from colleges and research institutions to their respective counties (cities), promoting the integration of science and technology with the economy, and achieving remarkable results. However, they have also encountered numerous difficulties in their work, with the following being the most prominent:

    First, some local officials (including some party and government leaders) do not fully understand the importance of appointing science and technology deputy county magistrates. For example, when some science and technology deputy county magistrates participate in the decision-making process for major economic construction issues in the county (city) committee and government, they have proposed many feasible suggestions, but the main party and government leaders have been slow to respond, delaying decisions; again, some officials believe that the science and technology leaders sent from above, regardless of their work performance, will leave after two years, making them "pigeon-brand" officials, not as good as promoting "permanent-brand" officials who are familiar with local conditions, and so on.

    Second, the responsible departments are unclear. The first meeting of science and technology deputy county magistrates in Hubei Province was convened by the Provincial Higher Education Work Committee, and the second was jointly convened by the Provincial Party Committee Organization Department, Higher Education Work Committee, and Science and Technology Personnel Bureau. The responsibility for dispatching and managing science and technology deputy county magistrates has not been clearly defined, resulting in difficulties for science and technology deputy county magistrates in seeking assistance when they encounter problems in their work and life.

    Third, the work responsibilities are not clear. Some science and technology deputy county magistrates have reported that although the province has stipulated 8 responsibilities for their work, there are no specific implementation guidelines, making it difficult to manage in actual work. Some science and technology deputy county magistrates, after taking office, are busy with administrative tasks all day, making it difficult to focus on major science and technology work.

    Fourth, there is no activity funding. The activity funding for science and technology deputy county magistrates in Hubei Province has not yet been secured, and science and technology deputy county magistrates generally report that without money in hand, it is difficult to accomplish anything!

### 科技副县长遇到的困难

    科技副县长遇到的困难
    湖北省从1988年3月起，陆续对所属74个县
  （市）配备了科技副县（市）长。据有关部门调查，这些同志到职一年来，将大专院校和科研院所的科学技术引向所在县（市），推进了科技与经济的结合，取得了显著的工作成效。但是，他们在工作中也遇到了不少困难，突出的有以下几个方面：
    一是当地有的同志（包括部分党政领导）对选派科技副县长的重要意义认识不足。如，有的科技副县长参与县（市）委、县（市）政府重大经济建设问题决策时，提出了不少可行性建议，但党政主要负责同志却迟迟不表态，拖而不决；又如，有的同志认为，上面派来的科技领导干部，不管工作好坏，两年时间一到就走了，是
  “飞鸽牌”，不如提拔对当地情况熟悉的“永久牌”，等等。
    二是主管部门不明确。湖北省第一次科技副县长座谈会是由省高校工作委员会主持召开的，第二次是由省委组织部、高校工委、科干局联合召开的。选派与管理科技副县长的工作到底归哪家负责，至今没有明确，致使科技副县长们在工作和生活方面遇到困难时，不知向哪个部门反映。
    三是工作职责不清楚。有的科技副县长反映，省里虽然对他们的工作职责作了8条规定，但没有具体实施细则，在实际工作中不好把握。有的科技副县长到职后，整天忙于事务，难于把精力集中到抓科技工作的大事上。
    四是无活动经费。湖北省科技副县长的活动经费至今未落实，科技副县长普遍反映，手里没有钱，想干点事可难了！
