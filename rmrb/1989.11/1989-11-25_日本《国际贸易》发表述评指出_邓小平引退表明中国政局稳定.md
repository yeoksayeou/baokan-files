Japan's *International Trade* published a commentary on November 21, emphasizing that Deng Xiaoping's retirement signifies political stability in China, marking a milestone in China's political modernization and democratization.

The article states that the Fifth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee determined the basic guidelines for economic work in the coming years and agreed to Deng Xiaoping's retirement, appointing Jiang Zemin as the new Chairman of the Military Commission.

Japanese media often refer to Deng Xiaoping as "China's top power figure." He played a decisive role in ending the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and establishing the path of modernization, initiating the reform and opening-up policy. China's designation of Deng Xiaoping as the "chief architect of political reform" is apt.

In China's long history, it is rare for a top leader to relinquish all positions while still alive. From a broader perspective, this can be seen as a milestone in China's political modernization and democratization, indicating a positive international response to Deng Xiaoping's retirement.

It also shows that China's current political situation is stable, ensuring the consistency and continuity of policies. Japanese political and business circles generally believe that the current policy direction will not change. This is the basic view and common judgment.

Recently, some opinions in Japan's reports on China have been: "Democratization is absolutely good, even a slightly different view is absolutely bad," "In economics, liberalization is better, management and control are not good," and so on. The essence of the problem is what is appropriate for China's national conditions. Ignoring the other party's national conditions and judging based on one's own standards and abstract concepts can easily lead to misjudgments. China, whether in terms of territory or population, is a large country with imbalances and diversity in economics and culture. Everything must be done step by step, solidly, and in an orderly manner, which will lead to stability within China and in its foreign relations. In this sense, we look forward to the implementation of the decisions made by the Fifth Plenary Session.

Japan has taken "assisting China's modernization" as one aspect of Sino-Japanese relations. We strongly hope that the Japanese government will quickly resume high-level official exchanges and loan provision after the Fifth Plenary Session.

### 日本《国际贸易》发表述评指出　邓小平引退表明中国政局稳定

    日本《国际贸易》发表述评指出
　　邓小平引退表明中国政局稳定
    本报讯　日本《国际贸易》11月21日刊登一篇述评强调，邓小平引退表明中国的政局稳定，是中国政治现代化和民主化的一个里程碑。
    文章说，中国共产党五中全会决定了今后数年间经济工作的基本方针，同时同意邓小平引退，并任命江泽民总书记接替邓小平为军事委员会主席。
    日本的新闻媒介把邓小平称为“中国的最高实力人物”。他为中国结束文革的混乱和确立现代化路线起了决定性作用，并且开创了改革开放的局面。中国把邓小平称为“政治的总设计师”，可以说是用词恰当。
    最高领导人在健在的时候把一切职务让给晚辈，这在中国长期的历史上是罕见的事情。从大局说，可以把它看作是中国政治现代化和民主化的一个里程碑，表明外界对邓小平引退是抱有好感的。
    它还表明中国目前的政局稳定，可以说政策的一贯性和连续性有了保证。对于这次的决定，日本的政界和财界都认为现行路线不会改变。这是基本的观点，共同的判断。
    日本国内在最近有关中国的报道中出现了这样一些论调：“民主化要求绝对好，哪怕是稍有一点不同的见解也是绝对坏”、
  “在经济方面还是自由化好，实行管理和控制不好”等等。问题的本质在于什么是符合中国国情的做法。由于无视对方的国情，按照自己的尺度和抽象的概念来推测对方，所以很容易发生判断错误。中国无论是从国土还是从人口来说，都是一个大国，在经济上和文化上具有不均衡性和多样性。凡事要一步一步地、扎扎实实地进行，即有秩序地进行，这样会导致中国国内及对外关系的稳定。从这一意义上，我们期待着五中全会决定的贯彻实行。
    日本已经把“协助中国的现代化”作为日中关系的一个方面。我们强烈希望日本政府在五中全会以后尽快地恢复悬案的政府高级官员的交往和提供贷款。
