Senior Military Officer of Cambodian Resistance Forces Exposes Vietnam's False Withdrawal
Points Out Vietnam Never Intended to Make Cambodia an Independent Nation

According to the Chief of Staff of the Supreme Command of the United Front of Democratic Kampuchea, Sam Sith, there are Vietnamese troops strengthening defenses around Phnom Penh and building a military line along the Mekong River.

The Chief of Staff, who is in charge of operational planning, told several foreign journalists, "We are certain that there are still several thousand Vietnamese soldiers in Cambodia serving as government officials and military advisors." He said, according to intelligence reports, after Vietnam announced its so-called "complete withdrawal" on September 26 this year, we have discovered more than 30,000 Vietnamese troops hiding in the jungles of provinces such as Pursat, Takeo, and Battambang.

When discussing the current military situation in Cambodia, Sam Sith said, the true military objective of the Cambodian resistance forces is to "put pressure on Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime" to stop the massacre of the Cambodian people and force them to agree to several principles for peace talks. He stated, "We have always advocated for national reconciliation."

He said, "The Cambodian people, including some officials of the Heng Samrin regime, have gradually realized that Vietnam never intended to make Cambodia a safe and independent nation."

    柬抵抗力量高级军官揭露越南假撤军
    指出越从未打算让柬成为独立国家
    新华社柬埔寨特莫同11月12日电　据柬埔寨西哈努克国民军联合军事司令部最高司令部参谋长段斋透露，留在柬境内的越军加强了金边周围的防御，并沿湄公河岸筑起了一道军事防线。
    这位负责行动计划的参谋长对几位外国记者说，“我们肯定现在仍有几千名越南军人在柬埔寨担任政府官职和军事专家。”他说，据情报人员透露，今年9月26日越南宣布所谓“全部撤军”后我们已发现有3万多名越军藏身于磅同、桔井、柏威夏等省的丛林里。
    段斋参谋长在谈到柬埔寨目前的战事时说，民柬抵抗力量的真正军事目的是要给越南和金边政权“施加压力”，要他们不再屠杀柬埔寨人民并迫使他们同意接受和谈的几项原则。他表明，“我们一向主张民族和解”。
    他说，柬埔寨人民，甚至韩桑林政权的一些官员，都渐渐意识到越南从来就没打算让柬埔寨成为安全和独立的国家。”
