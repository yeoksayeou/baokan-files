The Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries held a reception in Beijing today to commemorate the "International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People" on November 29.

On December 2, 1977, the United Nations decided to designate November 29 as the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. In July 1978, the Belgrade Conference of Non-Aligned Movement Foreign Ministers also adopted the same resolution to support the struggle of the Palestinian people.

On November 15 of last year, the State of Palestine, with Jerusalem as its capital, was proclaimed. This marked the end of the fragmented situation of Palestine that had persisted since 1948 and the beginning of a phase of determining national identity and establishing an independent and free State of Palestine.

However, with the support of the United States, the Israeli authorities have brutally infringed upon the Palestinian people's right to independence and peace, invading Palestinian territory and savagely persecuting and killing Palestinians in the occupied areas.

In his speech, the President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, Han Xu, said that the Chinese people are deeply concerned about the developments in the Middle East and have always stood firmly on the side of the Palestinian people, resolutely supporting the just struggle of the Palestinian people and firmly supporting all efforts made by the Palestinian people to justly resolve the Palestinian issue. He strongly demanded that the Israeli authorities abandon their stubborn stance, stop suppressing the Palestinian people in the occupied areas, and actively respond to reasonable suggestions from all relevant parties. He said that this would not only be beneficial to the development of the situation in the Middle East but also in line with the interests of all peoples in the Middle East, including the Israeli people, and would also be conducive to world peace and stability.

In his speech, Youssef Rajoub, the Ambassador of the State of Palestine to China, said that the Palestinian people are determined to achieve a just and lasting peace in the Middle East and are fully committed to the peace process in order to achieve their goals within the framework of the Middle East International Conference convened under the auspices of the United Nations and in accordance with the United Nations Charter and resolutions. He also condemned the various forms of support provided by the United States to the Israeli authorities.

Attendees at today's reception included Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Liao Hansheng, as well as Palestinian diplomats, experts, and students in China.

　　对外友协在京举行招待会
　　纪念“声援巴勒斯坦人民国际日”
    新华社北京11月29日电　（记者许忆纯）中国人民对外友好协会今天在北京举行招待会，纪念“11月29日声援巴勒斯坦人民国际日”。
    1977年12月2日，联合国决定11月29日为声援巴勒斯坦人民国际日。1978年7月贝尔格莱德不结盟外长会议也通过了同样的决定，以声援巴勒斯坦人民的斗争。
    去年11月15日，以耶路撒冷为首都的巴勒斯坦国宣告成立。这标志着从1948年起延续下来的巴勒斯坦分崩离析的状况结束，进而开始了一个确定民族归属、建立自由独立的巴勒斯坦国的阶段。
    但以色列当局在美国的支持下，粗暴地侵犯巴勒斯坦人民要求独立和平的权利，入侵巴勒斯坦国土，对被占领区巴勒斯坦人民进行野蛮迫害和残杀。
    对外友协会长韩叙在讲话中说，中国人民十分关注中东形势的发展，始终坚定不移地站在巴勒斯坦人民一边，坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民的正义斗争，坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民为公正解决巴勒斯坦问题所作出的一切努力。他在讲话中强烈要求以色列当局放弃顽固立场，停止镇压被占领区的巴勒斯坦人民，积极响应有关各方面提出的合理建议。他说，这将不仅有利于中东地区形势的发展，也符合包括以色列人民在内的所有中东国家人民的利益，同时也将有利于世界和平与稳定。
    巴勒斯坦国驻华大使尤素夫·拉吉布在讲话中说，巴勒斯坦人民决心在中东地区实现公正、持久的和平，完全致力于和平进程，以便在联合国主持召开的中东国际会议范围内，按照联合国宪章和联合国决议实现他们的目标。他还谴责美国给以色列当局提供各种形式的支持。
    出席今天招待会的有全国人大常委会副委员长廖汉生，以及巴勒斯坦国驻华外交官、专家和留学生等。
