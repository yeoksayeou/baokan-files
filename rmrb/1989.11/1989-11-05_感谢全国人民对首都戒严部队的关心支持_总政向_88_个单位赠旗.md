The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army held a flag presentation ceremony today to express gratitude to the nation for their concern and support for the capital's martial law troops. Banners embroidered with the words "Thank you for the people's care and support" were presented to relevant units.

According to the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, party and government organs, enterprises and institutions, people's organizations, and tens of thousands of people from all over the country have expressed their concern for the capital's martial law troops through letters, telegrams, and donations. Over the past four months, the Mass Work Department of the General Political Department has received more than 350,000 letters of condolence and more than 1,800 batches of condolence items from all over the country. Among them, various food items totaled more than 5.8 million kilograms, and daily necessities totaled nearly 1 million items. Additionally, more than 3 million yuan in condolence money was received.

The aforementioned condolence letters and items have all been promptly forwarded to the martial law troops by the General Political Department. Condolence money sent to the families of martyrs who died in the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots has been forwarded to the families of the martyrs; some of the condolence money donated to the martial law troops has been declined; for those that could not be declined, according to the instructions of the military commission leaders, a beautifully designed "Capital Guardians Memorial Album" has been made and distributed to every soldier in the martial law troops to forever remember the people's deep affection.

To express the deep gratitude of the martial law troops, the General Political Department has sent letters of thanks to 5,473 units and individuals who donated money and items; presented "Commemorative Certificates" to 203 individuals who provided outstanding support to the martial law troops; and today presented banners to 88 units.

Deputy Director of the General Political Department Zhou Wenyan spoke at the flag presentation ceremony. He said that through the letters and condolence items, the soldiers saw the noble qualities of the people's love for the Communist Party, love for socialism, and love for the children of the people. They felt the common aspirations of all ethnic groups to stop the turmoil, suppress the counter-revolutionary riots, and maintain stability and unity. This has inspired the soldiers to firmly carry out the orders of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, and to complete the martial law mission with a sense of honor and responsibility. He said that in this struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riots, our Party, state, and military have undergone a severe test. The reason why our military has passed this test is the result of adhering to the Party's absolute leadership over the military and the result of being nurtured by the people. He, on behalf of the capital's martial law troops, expressed heartfelt thanks to the party and government leaders and the masses of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions.

Deputy Chief of the General Staff Xu Huizhi, Deputy Director of the General Logistics Department Li Lun, and Deputy Commander of the Beijing Military Region Li Laizhu attended the flag presentation ceremony.
