The annual International Music Festival is one of Macau's largest international cultural exchange activities. Each concert during the festival attracts celebrities from various fields, demonstrating the local community's high regard for the event.

This year marked the third edition, concluding with a "Friendship Concert." The concert featured the Central Symphony Orchestra, American-Portuguese violinist Elma Oliveira, and Taiwanese trumpeter Ye Shuhuan, making the performance particularly noteworthy. They performed works by Wagner, Vieuxtemps, Haydn, and Richard Strauss. After each piece, the audience of over 2,000 people enthusiastically applauded. Even after the concert ended, the audience lingered, prompting the Central Symphony Orchestra to perform two additional pieces.

Macau's music enthusiasts are well acquainted with the Central Symphony Orchestra. This was their third visit to Macau, and each performance left a deep impression. Members of the orchestra were even recognized by locals while shopping or sightseeing. During this festival, musicians from the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Portugal, Romania, and Japan performed in nine concerts. The Central Symphony Orchestra participated in three of the largest concerts: the opening ceremony, the closing ceremony, and the "Opera Arias Selection Concert." The eight opera singers in the "Opera Arias Selection Concert" had won major international vocal competitions. The ticket prices for these three concerts were the highest. The Central Symphony Orchestra's significant role in the festival is evident.

Conductor Chen Zuoyang, who led the "Opera Arias Selection Concert" and the closing "Friendship Concert," is highly respected by Macau music lovers. During his meeting with music enthusiasts at the New Lianhua Hotel, over 200 fans came to see him in just over an hour. As an advisor for this year's festival, Chen was sought after by reporters from Macau, Hong Kong, Portugal, and Britain. Macau Television and the *Macau Daily* featured him multiple times in prime-time slots and prominent positions.

Macau newspapers described the Central Symphony Orchestra's performance and Chen Zuoyang's conducting as "mesmerizing the audience," which is not an exaggeration. One music critic commented, "If the Central Symphony Orchestra had more opportunities to perform and engage in international exchanges, it could certainly rank among the world's top orchestras."

　　音符编织的友谊纽带
　　——中央交响乐团在澳门国际音乐节
　　潜元兹
    一年一度的国际音乐节是澳门一项规模较大的国际文化交流活动。其间的每场音乐会，各届名流云集，足见当地视音乐节为盛事。
    今年是第三届，以“友谊音乐会”结束。“友谊音乐会”由中央交响乐团与美籍葡裔小提琴家艾尔玛·奥里微拉和台湾小号演奏家叶树涵登台，海峡两岸音乐家携手演出，使这台音乐会显得格外引人注目。他们演奏了瓦格纳、维亚夫斯基、海顿和理查·施特劳斯的作品。每曲终了，全场2000余名听众均报以热烈的掌声。音乐会结束时，听众仍久久不离去，中央交响乐团只得加演了两支曲子。
    澳门的音乐听众对中央交响乐团是非常熟悉的。他们已是第3次到澳门演出，每次都留下深刻印象，乐团的人上街游玩或购物，竟能被当地人认出来。本届音乐节上，有美、英、法、意大利、西班牙、巴西、葡萄牙、罗马尼亚、日本等国音乐家演出9场音乐会，而中央交响乐团担任其中规模最大的3场音乐会的演奏，这就是开幕式、闭幕式和名家荟萃的“歌剧名曲精选音乐会”。“歌剧名曲精选音乐会”上演唱的8名歌剧演员大多在国际重要声乐比赛中获过奖。这3场音乐会的票价也最高。中央交响乐团在音乐节上举足轻重的地位，由此可见。
    执棒指挥“歌剧名曲精选音乐会”和闭幕式“友谊音乐会”的指挥家陈佐湟是澳门乐迷仰慕的对象。他在新丽华酒店会见音乐爱好者时，一个多小时里，竟有200多名乐迷闻风而至。他又是本届音乐节顾问，澳门、香港和葡萄牙、英国的新闻记者争相采访，澳门电视台、《澳门日报》在黄金时间和显著位置多次作了报道。
    澳门报纸有文章称，中央交响乐团的演奏与陈佐湟的指挥
  “疯魔了听众”，并非夸张。一位音乐评论家便认为：“如果有更多的登台演出与国际交流机会，中央交响乐团完全可以列入世界一流的乐队。”
