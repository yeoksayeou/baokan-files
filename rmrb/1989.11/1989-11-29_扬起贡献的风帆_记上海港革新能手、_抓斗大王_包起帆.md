Hoisting the Sail of Contribution
– A Record of Shanghai Port Innovator, "Grab Bucket King" Bao Qifan
New China News Agency Reporter Feng Yizhen

Twenty years ago, a 17 or 18-year-old Bao Qifan came to Shanghai Port to work as a loader. This was a timber operation area. Here, the annual timber throughput accounted for 1/4 of the national timber throughput. The vast wharf was piled high with timber, and it seemed that everything was made of wood.

For many years, the loading and unloading of timber mainly relied on workers using steel ropes with hooks to lift. Workers spent 8 hours a day dealing with timber, and the merciless "wood tiger" rampaged on the wharf.

Scenes of tragedy were deeply etched in memory: a protruding log pressed heavily on a worker's shoulder, causing his ribs to break and pierce his liver, leading to his death; a log fell from the steel rope and unfortunately struck a young female worker's head, causing her to collapse instantly.

An idea kept lingering in Bao Qifan's mind: why couldn't the loading and unloading of timber be mechanized? He wanted to design a specialized timber grab bucket to replace manual labor. Shanghai Port is China's largest port, and it must blaze a new trail in this area.

He embarked on this bumpy and arduous path of creation.

In 1977, just as the college entrance examinations were restored, he brought his "dream of the grab bucket" and entered Shanghai Second Industrial University to study lifting and transportation. Bao Qifan, who had only completed two years of junior high school, relied on diligence and hard work to graduate with excellent results.

He began to develop the timber grab bucket. He frequented libraries and technical information centers to consult materials, and worked tirelessly day and night on design, calculation, and development.

For his "dream of the grab bucket," he devoted all his heart and soul, and paid an immeasurable amount of effort. The sketches and drawings he made for dozens of innovations were over a meter high, and 95% of these were completed at night. During the intense trial periods, he often stayed on the wharf and in the ship's hold for days on end. One day, his wife, furious, brought their child to the wharf. She saw Bao Qifan busy at work on the wharf, her heart softened, and her anger dissipated. She quickly called their son Weiwei to call his father. But the two-year-old son blinked his eyes, not recognizing whether this person with a safety helmet, wearing a tattered cotton jacket, with red eyes, and a dirty face was his father, and hesitated to speak.

With this spirit and perseverance, they overcame one difficulty after another. However, the opening and closing mechanism of the grab bucket was still difficult to conquer.

Once, during a trip to Beijing for a labor conference, he was inspired by a retractable pen core used for recording. Upon his return, he went to the Zhonghua Ballpoint Pen Factory to seek advice. He sincerely explained his purpose, visited several times, and finally gained support. With the help of the workers, he solved the design problem of the grab bucket's opening and closing mechanism.

The first timber grab bucket, carrying his and his colleagues' blood, sweat, and hopes, was finally born. Soon after, he and several colleagues designed and developed five other types of timber grab buckets, forming a unique set of port log grab bucket mechanized loading and unloading process systems in the country.

In 1984, this set of grab buckets and processes were fully promoted in the loading and unloading area, completely changing the face of timber loading and unloading. From 1984 to the present, a total of ten thousand tons have been loaded and unloaded, and the accident frequency rate has dropped by 99.01% compared to the 10 years before 1984. The labor productivity of workers has increased by approximately 2.5 times.

Last year, he successfully developed the "asynchronous opening and closing single-rope multi-jaw scrap steel block grab bucket." This grab bucket is like a magical and flexible hand, with 6 jaws that can move independently until various irregular goods are tightly gripped. In the past, synchronous opening and closing grab buckets often got stuck by a large block, preventing the other jaws from closing tightly. Now, the situation of goods falling down has changed, the loading and unloading efficiency has improved, and safety has been ensured.

In 10 years, Bao Qifan, known as the "Grab Bucket King," has completed more than 50 innovations with the cooperation of his colleagues. He has designed and developed four major series and 26 varieties of various grab buckets and loading and unloading equipment accessories. Roughly calculated, this has improved production efficiency, reduced manpower, and created economic benefits of over 6.5 million yuan for the Shanghai Port Timber Loading and Unloading Company.

The extraordinary creativity of a technical personnel who started as a loader has won widespread praise and high evaluation from domestic and foreign peers. His innovation achievements have won 5 international invention awards. The "15-ton sliding block single-rope multi-jaw grab bucket" won a gold medal at the 15th Geneva International Invention and New Technology Exhibition. The "asynchronous opening and closing single-rope multi-jaw scrap steel block grab bucket" won a gold medal at the 80th Paris International New Technology and Achievement Competition and Exhibition this May. The organizer of the international invention exhibition said, "Bao solved a complex problem with a simple method, amazing!" He has also won multiple awards from the Ministry of Communications, National Invention Awards, and more.

As his innovation achievements are promoted across many ports in the country, Bao Qifan's name has spread rapidly in the water transport industry. A leader from a certain unit said: "Bao Qifan, we'll give you a three-room apartment, 300 to 500 yuan per month, come to us." Bao Qifan was not tempted. However, to promote these new processes and specialized grab buckets, he tirelessly traveled to Qingdao, Qinhuangdao, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and other ports to provide selfless assistance, and enthusiastically received many peers coming to learn from him.

His creative labor has been recognized and highly evaluated by society. In 1986, he received the "May First Labor Medal" awarded by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Recently, he was also named a National Labor Model.

    扬起贡献的风帆
　　——记上海港革新能手、“抓斗大王”包起帆
　　新华社记者　冯亦珍
    20年前，十七八岁的包起帆进上海港当装卸工。这是一个木材作业区。这里每年的木材吞吐量占全国木材吞吐量的1／4，偌大的码头上到处堆着木材，可谓满目皆木。
    多少年来，装卸木材主要靠工人用钢丝绳串着挂钩起吊。工人一天8小时与木材打交道，无情的“木老虎”在码头上肆虐。
    一幕幕的惨景刻骨铭心：一根突出的原木在工人肩上沉重的一压，竟使这名工人肋骨断裂刺入肝脏而死；一根原木从钢丝绳中脱落，不幸击中一名青年女工的头部，她当即倒毙。
    一个念头萦绕包起帆的脑际：为什么装卸木材不能实现机械化呢？他想设计一种木材专用抓斗来替代人工。上海港是中国的最大港口，一定要在这方面闯出新路。
    他踏上这条坎坷而艰辛的创造之路。
    1977年，高考刚恢复。他带着自己编织的“抓斗之梦”，考入了上海第二工业大学，攻读起重运输专业。仅读过两年初中的包起帆，靠勤奋、刻苦，以优异成绩毕业。
    他开始研制木材抓斗。他出入于图书馆、科技情报所查阅资料，不分昼夜地埋头设计、演算、研制。
    为了他的“抓斗之梦”，他倾注了自己全部心血，付出了难以计量的辛劳。他为几十项革新所画的草图、设计的图纸已有1米多高，这些95％以上都是利用夜间完成的。在试验紧张的时刻，他常常一连几天在码头、船舱内。有一天，他的妻子气呼呼地抱着孩子赶到码头。她目睹包起帆在码头上忙于工作的身影心软了，气消了，忙叫儿子炜炜叫爸爸。但两岁的儿子眨巴着眼睛已认不出这个头戴安全帽、身穿破棉袄、眼睛红红、脸又很脏的人是不是爸爸，迟迟不愿开口。
    靠这种精神和毅力，他们攻克了一个又一个难关。但是抓斗的开闭装置还一时难以攻克。
    一次，正逢他去北京开工代会。会上一支用于记录的圆珠笔笔芯伸缩自如的装置给了他启示。归来后，他就到中华圆珠笔厂去取经。他诚恳地说明来意，几次登门求教，终于获得支持，在工人的帮助下，解决了抓斗开闭装置的设计问题。
    第一个木材抓斗带着他和同事的心血和热望终于诞生了。紧接着，他和几个同事设计、研制了其它5种木材抓斗，形成独特的国内第一套港口原木抓斗机械化装卸工艺系统。
    1984年这套抓斗及工艺在装卸区中全面推广使用，木材装卸面貌大变。1984年至今，累计装卸万吨，事故频率数比1984年前10年下降了99.01％，工人的劳动生产率约提高2.5倍。
    去年他又研制成功“异步启闭式单索多瓣废钢块料抓斗”。这种抓斗犹如神奇灵活的手掌，6个颚板可分别动作，直至将各种不规则货物夹紧为止。过去常见的同步启闭抓斗，常因某一大块轧住，其他几瓣就无法紧闭。而今货物呼呼掉下的状况改变了，装卸效率提高了，安全也得到保证。
    10年中，被称为“抓斗大王”的包起帆在同事的协作下，先后完成了50多项革新，设计和研制的各种抓斗及装卸设备的附属工具共4大系列、26个品种。据粗略计算，因此提高生产效率、减少人力、为上海港木材装卸公司创造的经济效益达650多万元。
    一个装卸工出身的技术人员的非凡创造力博得国内外同行广泛的赞扬和高度评价。他的革新成果，有5项获国际发明奖。“15吨滑块式单索多瓣抓斗”在第十五届日内瓦国际发明与新技术展览会上获金奖。
  “异步启闭式单索多瓣废钢块料抓斗”在今年5月获第80届巴黎国际新科技成果竞赛博览会金奖。国际发明展的组织者说，“包用简单的办法，解决了复杂的难题，了不起！”他还多次获交通部科技成果奖、国家发明奖等。
    随着他的革新成果在全国许多港口推广，包起帆的名字在水运行业不胫而走。某单位的领导说：“包起帆，给你3室1厅，每月300至500元，到我们这里来吧。”包起帆不为心动。但是为了推广这些新工艺和专用抓斗，他不辞劳苦地到过青岛、秦皇岛、南京、广州等港口作无私的帮助，还热情接待了许多港口前来取经的同行。
    他的创造性劳动得到社会的承认和高度评价。1986年，他获中华全国总工会颁发的“五一”劳动奖章。最近，他又被评为全国劳动模范。
