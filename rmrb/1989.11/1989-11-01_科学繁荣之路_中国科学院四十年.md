Today, November 1, marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In a courtyard in Beijing's Dongsi, the first director of the academy's office, Mr. Yan Jici, recalls with deep emotion: Even before the founding of the People's Republic, at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held in September 1949, it was decided to establish the Chinese Academy of Sciences based on the former Central Research Institute, the North China Research Institute, and the Natural Science Research Institute in Yan'an. Shortly after the first Five-Star Red Flag was raised over Tiananmen Square, at the Third Session of the Central People's Government Council held on October 19, 1949, a resolution was passed appointing the renowned historian, archaeologist, and writer Guo Moruo as the first president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. On November 1, the Chinese Academy of Sciences was officially established in Beijing, marking a new era in the scientific endeavors of the Chinese nation.

The Growth of a Scientific "National Team"

At its inception, the academy had only 21 research institutes and nearly 300 scientific and technological personnel. Some of them had defied the Nationalists' threats and inducements to stay on the mainland; others, filled with patriotism, had overcome numerous obstacles imposed by imperialism to return from abroad; and still others had been selected from various parts of the country and from universities.

In 1955, the State Council decided to establish the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Divisions. More than 300 of the most outstanding experts in various fields of science and technology at the time were elected as division members. They were, for the most part, pioneers in various academic fields in China. They devoted their hearts and souls to the establishment of science in New China, to solving major problems in national defense and the national economy, and to training several generations of scientific and technological personnel. Their contributions are indelible. Some of them have already passed away, but their brilliant achievements in the scientific cause of the People's Republic will be forever recorded in history.

Starting from such a weak foundation, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has, after 40 years of trials and tribulations and the unremitting efforts of several generations, become a comprehensive research center for natural sciences with a considerable scientific and technological reserve and the ability to solve major scientific and technological problems in the national economy. It has become the backbone of China's scientific and technological undertakings. Today, the academy has 123 research institutes and 65 open laboratories. Among the more than 50,000 scientific and technological personnel, there are over 13,000 senior researchers. The academy has also built a number of advanced scientific research experimental facilities, such as the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider and the largest solar magnetic field telescope in East Asia.

Scientists Serving the People

Statistics show that over the past 40 years, the academy has won more than 1,300 major awards at the national level. Of these, 165 were for natural sciences, accounting for 49% of the national total, 148 for inventions, 177 for scientific and technological progress, 762 for scientific conferences, and more than 100 other national awards.

Scientists from the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry, the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, and Peking University began their research on the artificial synthesis of insulin in late 1958. Their work on the artificial synthesis of bovine insulin in 1965, as well as a series of high-level theoretical research results such as the quark model and the Goldbach conjecture, all won gold medals or ranked at the top in similar international competitions.

In seeking to serve national economic construction, the academy has solved a series of major scientific and technological problems for relevant state departments. For example, the theory of oil formation in terrestrial strata has played an important role in the development of geoscience and the petroleum industry in China. The finite element method established by Professor Feng Kang and others has become a modernized and systematized numerical method for solving partial differential equations, widely used in complex engineering design and scientific computation. Professor Wu Zhonghua's three-component flow theory, established in the 1950s, opened up a new field of gas dynamics and thermodynamics for impeller machinery, attracting widespread attention both domestically and internationally and being used by some developed countries to design high-performance supersonic impeller machinery. Since the end of 1986, in the breakthroughs in high-temperature superconducting materials that have emerged worldwide, Professor Zhao Zhongxian of the Institute of Physics and scientists from Tsinghua University and relevant units across the country have worked together to maintain China's leading position in several international competitions. These achievements have brought honor to the socialist motherland. In mathematics, the theory of compensated compactness was proposed; in physics, research on the equations of aerodynamics, as well as fivefold and eightfold quasi-crystals; in biology and chemistry, the artificial synthesis of yeast transfer RNA, the structural analysis and synthesis of artemisinin, the quantitative relationship between protein function genes and their biological activity, the linear homologous rule and inductive effect of organic compounds, and the ionic gene theory of crystal nonlinear optical effects; in the fields of resources, environment, ecology, agriculture, and geology, the theory of plate tectonics was established, the theory of stratified ore deposits was proposed, the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and its impact on the natural environment and human activities, the East Asian atmospheric circulation, and various atlases and basic data were accumulated and published. These have enriched the scientific treasures of the Chinese nation and the world.

The research and experiments on the complex iron ores of Daye, Bayan Obo, and Panzhihua provided scientific bases for the construction of the three major iron and steel bases; comprehensive surveys and ecological environment research on deserts, saline-alkali lands, red soils, hills, loess plateaus, and other areas, as well as effective comprehensive treatment and demonstration of medium- and low-yield fields; the development of remote hybridization and chromosome engineering breeding theory and techniques, and the selection of disease-resistant, high-yield, and high-quality varieties. All of these have made important contributions to China's science, national economy, and especially agriculture.

Many scientists, with their extensive knowledge and profound insights, have sincerely proposed a large number of consultations and suggestions to the central and local leaders at various levels on industrial and agricultural production, national defense construction, resource utilization, and other issues. This fully reflects their sincere devotion to the socialist motherland and their sense of mission.

Over the past 40 years, the academy has always placed equal importance on cultivating talent and producing results, training a large number of outstanding talents such as Peng Jiamu, Jiang Zhuying, Zhong Jiaqing, and Zhang Guanghou for the country. The academy has also sent batches of personnel to the national defense and industrial departments to help open up new industries. This is also a special contribution made by the academy to society and economic development.

To Pursue Advanced Technology

On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the academy's founding, renowned nuclear physicist Qian Sanqiang talked about the academy's contributions to the development of advanced technology.

Soon after the academy was established, in May 1950, the Chinese Academy of Sciences established the Institute of Modern Physics, focusing on nuclear research. Under extremely difficult conditions for scientific research at the time, nuclear physicists such as Zhao Zhongyao and Deng Jiaxian, numbering in the twenties and thirties, with a strong sense of patriotism, gave up their superior working and living conditions abroad and returned to China one after another. Under the embargo imposed by Western countries on China at the time, scientists made their own equipment and instruments, while also cultivating a group of technical backbone personnel in nuclear science through scientific and technological practice.

On January 15, 1955, the central government made a major decision to develop China's atomic energy science and technology. For a time, China's atomic energy industry flourished. Qian Sanqiang participated in the leadership of the atomic energy industry. By 1959, due to the changes in Sino-Soviet relations, the Soviet Union first withdrew its experts in this field. This, however, aroused great patriotic enthusiasm among China's scientific and technological workers. Soon, the Party Central Committee decided to develop the atomic energy industry through self-reliance.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences first provided strong support in terms of personnel. Soon, including Wang Ganchang, Peng Huanwu, Guo Yonghui, and other famous scientists, more than 1,000 scientists, engineers, technicians, and cadres from the Chinese Academy of Sciences were transferred to the nuclear weapons research institutions. At the same time, the academy also mobilized one-quarter of its forces to support work in the field of nuclear science and technology. Within the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Atomic Energy, to meet the needs of nuclear weapon design, some were assigned to conduct research related to nuclear fission, some conducted theoretical research, experiments, and trials on uranium isotope separation, and others purified plutonium, deuterium, and tritium. The work was done with great enthusiasm.

With the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, China's first atomic bomb exploded successfully on October 16, 1964. On June 17, 1967, China's first hydrogen bomb also exploded successfully. In the process of developing artificial Earth satellites, the Chinese Academy of Sciences also organized more than 30 research institutes to participate in the work. The prototype of China's first artificial Earth satellite was developed in the Zhongguancun Science City. Professor Qian summed up: In short, these works fully demonstrated the great role of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in scientific and technological reserves for the country.

Two Scientific Springs

The comrades of the Chinese Academy of Sciences all feel that there have been two scientific springs since the founding of the nation. The first scientific spring came in 1956. This was after a few years of pioneering and sowing in the scientific cause of New China, entering a season of blossoming flowers. During this period, Chairman Mao Zedong personally presided over a meeting on the issue of intellectuals, announcing that the vast majority of intellectuals had become part of the working class, and issued the great call to "march towards science." During this period, the central government formulated a 12-year long-term plan for the development of science and technology in the country, and China's scientific and technological undertakings thus embarked on a path of planned development. The "four urgent measures" to focus on the development of automation, semiconductors, electronics, and computer technology laid the foundation for the development of new scientific and technological fields in China. The Chinese Academy of Sciences entered a period of prosperity.

The ten years of turmoil brought a thriving Chinese Academy of Sciences to the brink of collapse. Even under such difficult conditions, the vast number of scientific and technological personnel still put the cause of the Party and the people first, with a strong sense of responsibility and a spirit of pursuing scientific truth, creating and utilizing every opportunity to carry out research, and achieving a number of gratifying results in mathematics, resource and environmental surveys and comprehensive treatment, high-energy physics, astrophysics, biophysics, and integrated circuit design and computer development.

Starting in 1978, the Chinese Academy of Sciences returned to the path of revitalization. The convening of the National Science Conference, Deng Xiaoping's wise judgment on behalf of the Party Central Committee that "science and technology are productive forces," and the reaffirmation that "intellectuals are part of the working class" and "scientific and technological modernization is the key to achieving the four modernizations" greatly inspired the vast number of scientific and technological personnel. The Chinese Academy of Sciences ushered in a second spring.

The Broad Road of Reform and Opening Up

After the National Science Conference, the Chinese Academy of Sciences was quickly restored and developed, but some of the problems in the original system became increasingly apparent. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, under the guidance of the central government's policy of "scientific and technological work must face economic construction, and economic construction must rely on science and technology," they determined the policy of "mobilizing and organizing the main forces to the main battlefield of serving national economic construction, while maintaining a lean force to engage in basic research and high-tech tracking." In basic research, they actively introduced the competition mechanism, broke the closed system, and established a number of open laboratories facing the country and even the world. Through the establishment of scientific funds and other means, they created conditions for outstanding young talents to stand out. To overcome the scattered nature of projects, they successfully organized comprehensive scientific and technological teams to go to the main battlefield. According to the different characteristics and laws of scientific research and development, they implemented a "one academy, two systems" operating mechanism. To ensure that scientific and technological achievements are quickly transformed into direct productive forces, they actively tried to establish operating entities with the main task of developing high-tech products. Currently, a number of companies affiliated with the academy have emerged in China's high-tech enterprises. According to statistics from 1988, the business volume of these high-tech enterprises has reached more than 1 billion yuan. There are more than 700 products with a value of over 100 million yuan, and export earnings exceed 10 million US dollars.

Standing at the Crossroads of Two Centuries

Standing at the crossroads of two centuries, looking ahead to the 21st century that is about to arrive, the comrades of the Chinese Academy of Sciences are filled with emotion. Zhou Guangzhao, the president of the academy, said: The 21st century will be a century of rapid development in science and technology around the world. History has provided us with an excellent stage. It is fortunate for us, the scientific and technological workers of the century, not only to leave footprints in the history of China's science and technology in this century but also to prepare for the progress of Chinese society, the revitalization of the economy, and the development of education and science and technology in the 21st century.

He said that recently, leading comrades of the central government pointed out that the role of the Chinese Academy of Sciences as a national team should be brought into play. This makes all the comrades of the academy feel the great responsibility of the times and the arduous tasks. They are determined to work with scientific and technological workers across the country to deeply study the new problems in China's national conditions and the development of science, society, and the economy. He said that the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has entered its "middle age," has, after decades of practice and exploration, basically found its own path. In the new era, it will strive to make contributions that are worthy of the motherland, worthy of science, and worthy of future generations.

    科学繁荣之路
    ——中国科学院四十年
    本报记者  王友恭
    今年11月1日，是中国科学院建院40周年。
    在北京东四的一个四合院里，担任过该院第一任办公厅主任的严济慈老人在深情地回忆：早在人民共和国成立之前，1949年9月召开的全国政治协商会议上，就做出了在原中央研究院和北平研究院以及延安自然科学研究院的基础上组建中国科学院的决定。新中国的第一面五星红旗在天安门前升起不久，1949年10月19日召开的中央人民政府委员会第三次会议上便通过了任命著名历史学家、考古学家、文学家郭沫若为中国科学院第一任院长的决议。11月1日，标志中华民族的科学事业进入崭新历史阶段的中国科学院在北京宣告成立。
    一支科研“国家队”的壮大
    建院之初，全院仅有21个研究所，近300名科技人员。他们有的是摆脱了国民党的威逼利诱，毅然留在祖国大陆；有的是满怀报效祖国的热忱，冲破帝国主义的重重阻挠从海外归来的科学家；还有些是从全国各地、高等院校中挑选来的。
    1955年政务院决定建立中国科学院学部，300多位当时全国科学技术各个领域中最优秀的专家当选为学部委员。他们大都是我国各个学术领域的开拓者。他们为新中国科学事业的创建，为解决国防和国民经济中的重大问题，为培养几代科技人员呕心沥血，做出了不可磨灭的贡献。他们中有些人已经辞离人世，但其为人民共和国科学事业做出的光辉业绩将永志史册。
    中国科学院从当年那样十分薄弱的基础起步，经过40年的风风雨雨，几代人的不懈努力，如今已经成为拥有9万职工、具有相当科学技术储备和解决国民经济重大科技问题能力的全国自然科学综合研究中心，成为中国科技事业的中坚。如今全院已有123个研究所，65个对外开放的实验室。5万多名科技人员中高级研究人员就有13000多人。该院还建成了北京正负电子对撞机、远东最大的太阳磁场望远镜等一批先进的科学研究实验设备。
    为人民服务的中国科学家
    据统计，40年来全院共有1300多项重大成果获得国家级奖励。其中获自然科学奖165项，占全国总数的49％，创造发明奖148项，科技进步奖177项，科学大会奖762项，其它国家级奖励100多项。
    该院上海生化所、上海有机所和北京大学的科学家们从1958年底开始，经过共同努力完成的人工合成胰岛素的研究，1965年获得的人工合成牛胰岛素以及层子模型、哥德巴赫猜想等一批高水平的理论研究成果，都在世界同类研究竞赛中拿到金牌或名列前茅。
    在寻求为国民经济建设服务的过程中，该院为国家有关部门解决了一系列重大的科学技术问题。如陆相生油理论，对我国地质科学的发展和石油工业的发展都起了重要的作用。该院冯康教授等创立的有限元方法，成为求解偏微分方程的一套现代化系统化的数值方法，被广泛应用于复杂工程设计和科学计算等多方面。该院吴仲华教授早在50年代创立的三元流动理论开拓了叶轮机械气动热力学新领域，受到国内外的广泛重视并被一些发达国家用于设计高性能跨声速叶轮机械。1986年底以来兴起的世界性高临界温度超导材料突破性进展中，该院物理所的赵忠贤教授等与中国科技大学和全国各有关单位的科学家们团结奋战，在数次国际间的激烈角逐中使我国保持领先地位。这些都为社会主义祖国赢得了荣誉。在数学方面，补偿列紧理论的提出；在物理方面，气动力学方程组的研究，以及五次和八次对称准晶；在生物和化学方面，酵母丙胺酸转移核醣核酸的人工合成，青蒿素的结构分析与合成，蛋白质功能基因的修饰与其生物活性的定量关系研究，有机化合物线性同系规律和诱导效应，晶体非线性光学效应的离子基因理论；在资源、环境、生态、农业等地学领域，建立了大地构造学说，层控矿床学说，研究了青藏高原的隆起及其对自然环境和人类活动的影响，东亚大气环流等，并积累出版了各种图志、基础资料。这些都充实、丰富了中华民族乃至世界的科学宝库。
    对大冶、白云鄂博和攀枝花复杂铁矿的研究和试验，为三大钢铁基地的建设提供了科学依据；对沙漠、盐碱地、红壤、丘陵、黄土高原等所进行的综合考察、生态环境研究与卓有成效的中、低产田综合治理的试验及示范、推广；远缘杂交与染色体工程育种理论、技术的发展与抗病高产优质品种的选育，所有这些都为我国科学、国民经济，特别是农业的发展作出了重要的贡献。
    许多科学家以其广博的学识、精辟的见解，就工农业生产、国防建设、资源利用等，为中央和地方各级领导进行宏观科学决策坦诚提出的大量咨询建议，充分反映出他们对社会主义祖国的赤诚忠心和责无旁贷的使命感。
    40年来，该院一直把出人才与出成果放在同等重要的地位，为国家培养出彭加木、蒋筑英、钟家庆、张广厚等一大批献身于祖国科学事业的优秀人才。该院曾多次成批、成建制地向国防、产业部门输送人才，协助开辟新兴产业。这也是该院为社会、经济发展做出的一种特殊贡献。
    为了开拓尖端科技
    在建院40周年的前夕，著名核物理学家钱三强教授谈起了中国科学院对发展尖端科技所做的贡献。
    建院不久，1950年5月中国科学院就成立了以原子核研究为主的近代物理研究所。在当时进行科学研究的物质条件非常艰苦的情况下，赵忠尧、邓稼先等二三十位核物理学家胸怀报国之志，毅然放弃在国外优越的工作和生活条件相继回国。在当时西方国家对中国实行禁运的情况下，科学家们自己动手制造设备仪器，同时通过科学与技术实践培养了一批核科学方面的技术骨干。
    1955年1月15日，中央作出了发展我国原子能科学技术的重大决策，一时间我国的原子能事业出现了欣欣向荣的局面。钱三强参加了原子能事业的领导工作。到1959年，由于中苏两国关系的变化，苏联首先撤走了这方面的专家。这反而激发了中国科技工作者极大的爱国主义热情。不久，党中央作出了自力更生发展原子能事业的决定。
    中国科学院对这项工作首先在人才方面给予大力支持。不久，包括王淦昌、彭桓武、郭永怀等一批著名科学家在内的中国科学院1000多名科学家、工程师、技术工人和干部被调到核武器研制机构。与此同时，该院还调动了占当时1／4的力量支援核科学技术方面的工作。在中国科学院原子能研究所内，为配合核武器设计的需要，有的分工进行与核裂变有关的研究，有的进行铀同位素分离的理论研究、实验和试制，有的进行钚、氘和氚的提纯，工作干得热火朝天。
    在全国人民的共同努力下，壮我国威的我国第一颗原子弹在1964年10月16日爆炸成功。1967年6月17日我第一颗氢弹又爆炸成功。在人造地球卫星研制的过程中，中国科学院也组织了30多个研究所参加工作。我国第一颗人造地球卫星的样机就是在中关村科学城里研制出来的。钱老概括说：总之，这些工作充分显示了中国科学院在科技储备方面对国家的重大作用。
    两个科学的春天
    中国科学院的同志们都觉得建国以来有两个科学的春天。第一个科学的春天是1956年来到的。那是新中国的科学事业经过建国后几年的创业播种之后，进入百花盛开的季节。在这一段时间里，毛泽东主席亲自主持召开了关于知识分子问题的会议，宣布了绝大多数知识分子已经是工人阶级的一部分，并发出了“向科学进军”的伟大号召。在此期间，中央制订了全国科学技术发展12年远景规划，我国的科技事业从此走上有计划发展的轨道。重点发展自动化、半导体、电子技术和计算机技术等“四项紧急措施”为我国新兴技术科学领域的发展奠定了基础。中国科学院进入了兴旺发达的时期。
    10年动乱使一个蓬勃发展起来的中国科学院濒于瓦解。就是在这样困难的条件下，广大科技人员还是以党和人民的事业为重，怀着强烈的责任心和追求科学真理的精神，千方百计创造和利用一切机会开展研究，并在数学、资源环境考察和综合治理、高能物理、天体物理、生物物理以及集成电路设计与计算机研制等方面取得一批可喜的成果。
    从1978年开始，中国科学院重新走上了振兴之路。全国科学大会的召开，邓小平同志代表党中央郑重提出“科学技术就是生产力”的英明论断，再次重申“知识分子是工人阶级的一部分”，“科学技术现代化是实现四个现代化的关键”等，极大地鼓舞了广大科技人员。中国科学院迎来了第二个春天。
    改革开放的康庄大道
    全国科学大会后，中国科学院得到迅速恢复和发展，但是原有体制存在的一些弊端日益暴露。党的十一届三中全会以后，他们在中央确定的“科技工作必须面向经济建设，经济建设必须依靠科学技术”的总方针指导下，确定了“把主要力量动员和组织到为国民经济建设服务的主战场，同时保持一支精干力量从事基础研究和高技术跟踪”的办院方针。在基础研究中，他们积极引进竞争机制，打破封闭体系，创建了一批面向全国乃至世界的开放实验室，通过设立科学基金等办法创造让优秀青年人才脱颖而出的条件。为了克服课题分散的状况，他们成功地组织了综合性的科技队伍上主战场。根据科研和开发两种工作不同的特点和规律，实行了“一院两制”的运行机制。为使科技成果尽快转化为直接生产力，他们积极试办以开发高技术产品为主要任务的经营实体。目前该院所属的一批公司已在中国的高技术企业中崭露头角。据1988年统计，这些高技术企业的营业额已达10亿元以上。超过百万元产值的产品多达700多项，出口创汇逾千万美元。
    站在世纪之交的桥头上
    站在两个世纪交替处，展望即将到来的21世纪，中国科学院的同志们心情激荡。周光召院长说：21世纪将是世界科技迅猛发展的世纪。历史为我们提供了极好的舞台，有幸生活在世纪之交的中国科技工作者，不仅要给本世纪我国的科技史留下足迹，也要为21世纪中国社会进步、经济的振兴与教育、科技的发展做好准备。
    他说，最近中央领导同志指出要发挥中国科学院作为国家队的作用。这使全院的同志们更加感到时代赋予历史责任的重大，任务的艰巨。他们决心与全国科技工作者一道，深入研究我国国情和科技、社会、经济发展的新问题。他说，进入“不惑之年”的中国科学院，经过几十年的实践、探索，基本走出了一条自己的路。在新的时期要更加努力做出无愧于祖国、无愧于科学、无愧于后人的贡献。
