According to Xinhua News Agency in Hangzhou on November 22, (trainee reporter Huang Hao) Liu Jian, director of the Institute of Linguistics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told reporters today that electronic computer technology has deeply penetrated the field of Chinese linguistics research. China is at the forefront of the world in using computers to analyze speech.

Liu Jian revealed this information to reporters at the "Fifth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Linguistic Society" held here. He said that in recent years, there have been significant breakthroughs in research on encoding Chinese characters into computer codes. Chinese characters are no longer an obstacle for computers to enter the field of Chinese linguistics. Using electronic computers to study language, process, classify, and refine natural language, makes it easier to extract information with fewer errors, and can reduce human labor by more than tenfold.

Liu Jian pointed out that China is at the forefront of the world in using computers to analyze speech. The Institute of Linguistics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and Peking University are both dedicated to using computers to analyze speech features and research artificial speech synthesis. Now, Chinese computers can produce sounds that are quite close to human speech. Human-computer dialogue in Chinese and using language commands for computers are no longer distant dreams. Liu Jian believes that this is a major breakthrough in linguistics research and a significant development in computer technology.

　　用现代化手段研究汉语获突破
　　我国计算机语音分析领先世界
    据新华社杭州11月22日电　（实习生黄浩）中国社会科学院语言研究所所长刘坚今天对记者说，电子计算机技术，已深入中国语言学研究领域，我国运用计算机分析语音走在世界前列。
    刘坚是在这里举行的“中国语言学会第五届年会”上向记者透露这一消息的。他说，近几年，把汉字编成计算机代码的研究有较大突破，汉字已不再是计算机进入汉语言学研究的障碍。利用电子计算机研究语言，对自然语言进行处理、分类、加工，便于提取，少有纰漏，可以降低人力耗费达十倍以上。
    刘坚指出，我国在运用计算机分析语音方面已走在世界前列。社科院语言研究所、北京大学都致力于用计算机分析语音特征、人工合成语音的研究。现在，中国的计算机已能发出比较接近人的声音，人机用汉语对话，人用语言指令计算机已不再是遥远的梦想了。刘坚认为，这不仅是语言学研究的一大突破，也是计算机的重大发展。
