The national conference on cadres' education and training was held in Lanzhou from November 8 to 13. The conference held that guiding cadres' training with Marxism-Leninism, making it scientific, systematic, and standardized, and better serving socialist revolution and construction are the fundamental tasks and purposes of cadres' training in state administrative organs at present.

Cadres' training is an important means and approach for improving the ideological and practical working levels of administrative personnel in our country. To clarify the significance and role of cadres' training and to promote the further development of this work, the State Personnel Department convened a seminar attended by directors of cadres' education departments from 30 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and 14 cities with separate state planning.

Vice Minister of the State Personnel Department Jiang Guan Zhuang gave a report at the meeting titled "Guiding the Training Work of State Administrative Organs with Marxism-Leninism." He pointed out that the objects of cadres' training are mostly experienced administrative personnel. Whether from the historical or the realistic angle, or from the need of our training work, we must stress the guidance of Marxism-Leninism in the training work. He said that to ensure that cadres have time and conditions to study Marxism-Leninism, it is necessary to establish a registration and assessment system for individuals and units. At the same time, from now on, we must grasp the important spirit of Jiang Zemin's speech on National Day as an important content of the training work and unify the thoughts of the training objects with the spirit of the speech.

The delegates at the meeting had a wide-ranging discussion on the direction, content, and form of the training work and exchanged experiences in the training work with each other.

At the seminar, the representatives also proposed that in the cadres' training work, the issuance of professional certificates should be strictly controlled, and administrative colleges should be reasonably allocated in accordance with the spirit of rectification and regulation. A complete set of rules and regulations should be established to make cadres' training scientific, systematic, and standardized.

    全国干部教育培训工作研讨会提出
    干部培训需科学化制度化正规化
    新华社兰州十一月十四日电　（记者周德广、实习生何静）全国干部教育培训工作研讨会于十一月八日至十三日在兰州召开。会议认为，以马列主义为指导、使干部培训趋于科学化、制度化、正规化，更好地为社会主义革命和建设服务，是当前国家行政机关干部培训的根本任务和目的。
    干部培训是我国提高行政人员思想水平和实际工作能力的一个重要手段和途径。为明确干部培训的意义和作用，推动这一工作进一步开展，国家人事部召开了有三十个省、自治区、直辖市和十四个计划单列城市的干部教育处长参加的研讨会。
    人事部副部长蒋冠庄在会上作了《以马列主义为指导，抓好国家行政机关的培训工作》的报告。他指出，干部培训工作的对象大多是有着丰富实践经验的机关工作人员。无论从历史的、现实的角度还是从我们培训工作的需要来讲，都要求我们必须强调在培训工作中坚持以马列主义为指导。他说，为确保在时间和条件上让培训干部学习马列主义，要建立必要的个人与单位的登记和考核制度。同时，从现在起，要把学习和贯彻江泽民同志国庆讲话的重要精神，作为培训工作的重要内容来抓，把培训对象的思想统一到讲话精神上来。
    与会代表们就培训工作的方向、内容和形式进行了广泛的讨论，并相互交流了培训工作的经验。
    在研讨会上，代表们还提出，在干部培训工作中要严格专业证书的颁发，并按治理整顿的精神，合理配置行政学院，建立完善的规章制度，使干部培训走向科学化、制度化、正规化。
