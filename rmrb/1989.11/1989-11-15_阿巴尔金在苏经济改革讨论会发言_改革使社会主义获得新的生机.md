Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Abalkin said at the opening of the All-Soviet Economic Reform Discussion Meeting on November 13 that the Soviet Union's economic reform is not about replacing the socialist system with another system, but about giving socialism new vitality.

Abalkin, who also serves as the chairman of the Soviet Government's State Economic Reform Commission, outlined a four-step plan for the Soviet economic reform at the meeting.

He said that the first step, from now until the end of next year, is to draft and pass a unified tax law, state bank law, as well as laws on price reform, labor remuneration, and social security. While accelerating the transition of enterprises to lease, cooperatives, and joint-stock companies, efforts will be made to reduce the budget deficit, curb the rapid growth of residents' income, and limit the issuance of loans and currency.

The second step, from 1991 to 1992, will see the full implementation of the aforementioned laws. Loss-making state farms will be reorganized based on family farms and cooperatives. Products outside of state orders will be allowed to be sold at free prices, and commodity and securities exchanges will be established.

The third step, from 1993 to 1995, aims to make the Soviet economy fully normal. Market factors will expand, prices and incomes will rise, and the supply and demand of consumer goods will be balanced.

The fourth step is expected to be realized from 1996 to 2000 or even the beginning of the next century. In these five years, a new management mechanism will be established, and the corresponding production structure and socio-economic relations will be fully formed.

Soviet leaders attach great importance to this discussion meeting on the formulation of the reform plan. Major leaders such as Gorbachev and Ryzhkov attended the meeting.

    阿巴尔金在苏经济改革讨论会发言
    改革使社会主义获得新的生机
    新华社莫斯科11月13日电　苏联部长会议副主席阿巴尔金在13日开幕的全苏经济改革讨论会上指出，苏联进行经济改革不是用其他制度来取代社会主义制度，而是使社会主义获得新的生机。
    兼任苏联政府国家经济改革委员会主席的阿巴尔金在会上介绍了苏联经济改革分4步走的设想。
    他说，第一步是从现在起到明年底，要制订并通过统一的税收法、国家银行法，及价格改革、劳动报酬和社会保障等方面的法律。在加快企业向租赁、合作社和股份公司的过渡的同时减少预算赤字，抑制居民收入的过快增长，限制贷款发放和货币发行。
    第二步是1991至1992年，上述各项法律将全面生效。在家庭农场和合作社基础上改组亏损农庄。允许国家订货以外的产品可以自由价格出售，建立商品和有价证券交易所。
    1993—1995年是第三步，这期间将使苏联经济完全趋于正常。市场因素扩大，价格和收入上升，消费品供求平衡。
    预计要在1996—2000年甚至下一世纪初实现第四步，这5年中将确立新经营机制，全面形成相应的生产结构和社会经济关系。
    苏联领导人对这一制订改革规划的讨论会很重视，戈尔巴乔夫和雷日科夫等主要领导人都出席了会议。
