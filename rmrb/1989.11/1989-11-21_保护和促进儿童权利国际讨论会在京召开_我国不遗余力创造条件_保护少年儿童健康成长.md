The international symposium on protecting and promoting children's rights was held in Beijing today. China is sparing no effort to create conditions to protect the healthy growth of minors.

According to a report by our correspondent Mao Lei from Beijing on November 20, "China is currently drafting the Law on the Protection of Minors. Beijing, Shanghai, and 11 other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have already issued local regulations to protect youth. Another six provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions are in the process of formulating relevant regulations." This was stated by Zhu Jianming, the Vice President of the China Law Society, at the opening of the international symposium on protecting and promoting children's rights held today.

He said that in the 40 years since the founding of New China, relying on various social organizations and social forces, China has actively taken various measures to protect children's rights and create favorable conditions for their growth and development, achieving remarkable results.

It is understood that China's infant mortality rate has significantly decreased from 200‰ before liberation to the current 35‰. The national coverage of children's planned immunization has reached 85%.

China has over 1 million primary and secondary schools, with 180 million students enrolled. Primary education has been universalized in 60% of the counties nationwide.

In terms of protecting the rights of disabled children, Zhu Jianming revealed that China has established 62 specialized nurseries for disabled children and over 800 social nurseries that also accept disabled children; 492 schools for the blind and deaf have been established, enrolling 50,000 students; schools for the intellectually disabled have been opened, with 14,000 students enrolled. Many places have also set up rehabilitation centers specifically for the treatment of disabilities in disabled individuals.

Additionally, China provides special education for minors who have committed minor offenses or crimes. Methods such as parental supervision, community assistance, vocational education, and rehabilitation are used to help minors correct their mistakes. For juvenile delinquents, many courts have established juvenile case panels, and various regions across the country have established special juvenile detention centers.

Kang Keqing, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attended the opening ceremony of the international symposium on protecting and promoting children's rights held in Beijing today. The convening of this symposium coincides with the 30th anniversary of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child.

This symposium, organized by the China Law Society with the assistance of the United Nations Children's Fund and other organizations, was attended by experts and scholars from 13 countries and regions.
