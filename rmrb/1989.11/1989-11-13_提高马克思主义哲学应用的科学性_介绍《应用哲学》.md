Edition: 6

Marxist philosophy, since its inception over a hundred years ago, has played a significant guiding role in people's social practices, production practices, and scientific practices. To better fulfill its practical functions, it is necessary to reflect on the history of the application of Marxist philosophy over the past hundred years, draw lessons, summarize experiences, and improve the scientific and conscious nature of the application of Marxist philosophy. Comrade Xu Houde's book "Applied Philosophy" (published by Yanbian University Press) is a bold attempt in this regard.

Currently, there are many differing views on "applied philosophy" within the philosophical circles in China. Based on his years of research, the author presents a comprehensive set of views on the discipline of "applied philosophy" in "Applied Philosophy." The author believes that applied philosophy is "the study of the philosophy of application and the methodology of application, or the theoretical and systematic philosophy of application and the methodology of application." In the process of studying the integration of "philosophical theory" with "specific realities," it is about how to effectively grasp the essence and laws of motion of real objects, and based on the essence and laws of motion of real objects, to effectively manipulate and control them. This ultimately enhances people's conscious and capable integration of philosophical theory with reality.

In "Applied Philosophy," the author systematically and deeply analyzes and expounds on the system and structure of the application of philosophy, the process and laws of the application of philosophy, the methods and ways of the application of philosophy, the effects and value evaluation of the application of philosophy, and the subjects and active roles of the application of philosophy. The author constructs a relatively complete system of "applied philosophy." In the book, the author proposes some basic principles that the application of philosophy must adhere to, including: the principle of unity based on social practice, which is to achieve the unity of "philosophical theory" and "specific realities" based on social practice; the principle of penetration with "philosophical theory" as the core, which is to penetrate the observation, analysis, and solution of "specific realities" in all aspects and the entire process with dialectical materialist thinking as the core; and the principle of comprehensiveness with "specific realities" as the base, which is to comprehensively use relevant knowledge and skills of "specific realities" with "specific realities" as the base.

The author also examines the various ways in which people concretely apply philosophical theories to reality, summarizing them into three categories: organizing type, perceiving type, and regenerative type. The so-called organizing type application method is to find some examples to illustrate relevant philosophical categories and principles, which belongs to explanatory organizing and processing, and is a primary application method. The so-called perceiving type application method refers to people mastering a certain amount of basic philosophical theoretical knowledge, consciously using some philosophical theories to directly observe and analyze "specific realities" through direct perception of specific things, seeking a relatively profound understanding and grasp of "specific realities." The so-called regenerative type application method is a higher-level application method. It requires the applier to actually transform philosophical theories with relatively universal significance into scientific viewpoints and methods that can correctly grasp "specific realities" with a certain degree of specificity, and to elevate the understanding and transformation of "specific realities" to a highly conscious level of philosophical theoretical thinking. Thus, it can make discoveries and creations in the development of philosophical theories and the understanding and transformation of "specific realities." Of course, which method to adopt for the application of philosophy to achieve theoretical effects requires specific analysis of specific problems and cannot be generalized.

    提高马克思主义哲学应用的科学性
    ——介绍《应用哲学》
    杜云波
    马克思主义哲学在其诞生之后的一百多年里，在人们的社会实践、生产实践和科学实践中曾发挥了巨大的指导作用。而要更好地发挥其实践功能，就有必要对马克思主义哲学一百多年来的应用史进行反思，吸取教训，总结经验，提高马克思主义哲学应用的科学性和自觉性。徐厚德同志的《应用哲学》一书（延边大学出版社出版），正是在这方面做了一些大胆的尝试。
    目前，我国哲学界对“应用哲学”仍有许多不同的看法。作者根据自己多年的研究，在《应用哲学》一书中提出关于“应用哲学”这门学科的一整套观点。作者认为，应用哲学是“关于哲学应用观和应用方法论的学问，或理论化、系统化的哲学应用观和应用方法论”，在研究“哲学理论与具体实际相结合”的过程中，如何富有成效地把握现实对象的本质和运动规律，以及依现实对象的本质和运动规律富有成效地进行操纵和控制的根本方法，从而提高人们把哲学理论与实际相结合的自觉性和能力。
    作者在《应用哲学》中，就哲学的应用系统及其结构，哲学的应用过程及其规律体系，哲学的应用方式和方法，哲学的应用效果及其价值评价，哲学的应用主体及其能动作用等方面进行了系统深入的分析和阐述，构筑了“应用哲学”较为完整的体系。在该书中，作者提出了哲学应用必须遵循的一些基本原则，其中主要有：以社会实践为基础的统一性原则，即以社会实践为基础，达到“哲学理论”与“具体实际”的统一；以“哲学理论”为核心的渗透性原则，即以唯物辩证思维为核心，渗透到观察、分析、解决“具体实际”的各个方面和整个过程；以及以“具体实际”为基质的综合性原则，即以“具体实际”为基质，综合运用有关“具体实际”的知识和技能。
    作者还考察了人们具体运用哲学理论于实际的各种方式，将其概括为整理型、传感型和再生型这三类。所谓整理型应用方式，是寻找某些实例来说明有关的哲学范畴和原理，属于注释性的整理加工，是一种初级的应用方式。所谓传感型应用方式，是指人们掌握了一定的哲学理论基础知识，通过对具体事物的直接感受，有意识地运用某些哲学理论来实地观察、分析“具体实际”，求得对具体实际的较为深刻的认识和把握。所谓再生型应用方式则是一种高级的应用方式，它要求应用者把具有较为普遍意义的哲学理论实际地转化为具有某种针对性的、能正确把握“具体实际”的科学观点和方法，同时把对“具体实际”的认识和改造上升到高度自觉的哲学理论思维水平，从而对发展哲学理论和认识改造“具体实际”有所发现和创造。当然，具体采取何种方式进行哲学应用能达到理论的效果，这要对具体问题进行具体分析，不能一概而论。
