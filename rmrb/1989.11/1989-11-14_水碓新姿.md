The sound of water-powered mills echoes endlessly, turning and turning on the ancient paths of history, singing a never-ending song...

The moon waxes and wanes, the sun rises and sets. In the past, water-powered mills turned day and night, only to ease the toil of those pounding rice, to fulfill the dream of a full belly.

Time passes, the stars shift. When the storm of the new era sweeps in, the waves crash against the turning wheels, the stone pestles grind the rough wood into powder, becoming export products for earning foreign exchange. Those ancient water-powered mills in remote villages embark on a journey of happiness. Today's water-powered mills, dancing with the dragons of the ocean, blend their once monotonous songs into the powerful waves of the four seas; the water-powered mills reborn, with their aged exteriors showing new vitality, are adorned with the rainbow hues of the five continents.

    水碓新姿
    余美西
    长音袅袅，不绝如缕，水碓在历史的古道上碾转着，碾转着，吟唱一曲没有终止符的长歌……
    月圆缺，日盈虚，昔日水碓日夜碌碌旋转，只为解放舂米人的劳累，难圆果腹的美梦。
    日月递嬗，斗转参横。当新时代的狂飙卷起潮水冲撞转轮飙幅条，石槌把杂木舂成粉末，成为出口创汇产品。那些荒古小山村的水碓便陶然闯进幸福的航程。今天的水碓，舞海洋之潜蛟，往昔咿咿呀呀的单调吟唱，溶进了四海惊涛的强音；重获新生的水碓，苍旧的外表展新姿，五洲的虹霓为它重彩镶金。
