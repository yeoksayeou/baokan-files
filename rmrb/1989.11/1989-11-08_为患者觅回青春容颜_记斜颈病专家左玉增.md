Li Xiuying is a simple rural girl who has suffered from congenital torticollis since childhood, affecting her appearance. Her parents took her to seek medical help everywhere, but to no avail. Just when she was at her wits' end, she met military doctor Zuo Yuzeng, who cured her torticollis and healed her emotional wounds. She wrote to the *Great Daily*, expressing her gratitude to the PLA comrades.

Zuo Yuzeng is the director and deputy chief physician of the 52875 Unit Hospital in Datong, Shanxi Province. He began researching and treating torticollis in 1980 and has successfully cured over 1,500 cases since then.

Song Ruyao, director of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Plastic Surgery Hospital and a first-level professor, praised Zuo Yuzeng: "Your research and treatment of torticollis are unparalleled in the country. The number of surgeries you perform and the high success rate are rarely seen in the world."

The First Operation

The beginning of Zuo Yuzeng's research and treatment of torticollis was both humorous and serious.

In the spring of 1980, during the peak of the family planning campaign, Zuo Yuzeng, then the head of the medical team, was invited by the local government to perform sterilization surgeries in rural areas.

The outdated notion of "the more children, the more blessings" tightly gripped the farmers' minds. Despite repeated propaganda, no progress was made in three days. On the fourth day, they arrived at the home of farmer Yang. Yang and his wife had three children, meeting the sterilization criteria. After some persuasion, Yang's wife unexpectedly agreed: "We can have the surgery, but first, you need to fix my husband's twisted neck."

What a condition! Yang had a twisted neck for over 30 years and had sought treatment everywhere without success. This posed a significant challenge for them. Zuo Yuzeng had never learned about it in textbooks or performed such a surgery in practice. However, the mission of a Communist Party member to contribute to the "basic national policy" and the responsibility of a doctor to relieve patients' pain drove him to tackle this difficulty!

Determination was easy, but the task was hard. Treating torticollis required surgery on the neck, where nerves are abundant and blood vessels are concentrated. Additionally, rural medical conditions were poor, and lives were at stake! Zuo Yuzeng endured hardships, visiting hospitals, seeking guidance, gathering materials, and studying diligently. He revised and improved the surgical plan countless times. After countless nights of deep thought, he focused his attention and made the first incision to cure torticollis.

He succeeded!

The Yang family was deeply moved. Yang's wife was the first to undergo sterilization. The news spread like wildfire, and the sterilization task for the entire county was completed ahead of schedule.

Torticollis is relatively common, but the causes of the disease are not the same. Zuo Yuzeng sacrificed his rest time year after year, often neglecting meals and rest, successfully developing a complete set of new methods for treating muscular torticollis. Later, he ventured into the research of spasmodic torticollis. The treatment difficulty of spasmodic torticollis is much greater than that of muscular torticollis, but he overcame it with his tenacious will.

Patients' Pain Outweighs Doctors' Reputation

A technician from the Water Resources Bureau in a county in Yunnan Province suddenly developed spasmodic torticollis. As someone who relies on his eyes for measurement, this disease was particularly troublesome. His neck was twisted, his face was deformed, and his vision could not focus as required for measurement, so he had to stop work and seek medical help. He visited hospitals in Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, underwent surgeries, but the disease remained uncured. It was Zuo Yuzeng who restored his neck to its original state, allowing him to resume his work with the measuring instrument.

Domestic and foreign experts believe that adult torticollis is not suitable for treatment, as treatment may easily result in double vision. Zuo Yuzeng, however, was not bound by expert opinions and bravely explored new methods. He pursued perfection in surgery and successfully treated over 600 cases of adult torticollis. After follow-ups, none of the patients developed double vision.

Most torticollis patients, due to not being cured in time, have facial deformities. Although the neck is straightened, facial deformities are not completely cured, which is still unsatisfactory. For this reason, Zuo Yuzeng turned his research focus to the blank spot of facial plastic surgery for torticollis patients. In 1987, Zuo Yuzeng was invited to lecture in Guilin and Wuxi. The famous scenery lost its appeal to him, and he immersed himself in a beauty hospital, studying diligently. Upon his return, he borrowed plastic surgery techniques and for the first time treated the facial deformities of torticollis patients.

Performing surgery on infants with torticollis involves significant risks. If anything goes wrong, his reputation would be ruined. However, Zuo Yuzeng considered relieving the patients' pain as soon as possible. He said: "Reputation is not important. Paving the way for future generations and contributing to the medical field is my duty."

With this noble professional ethos, he successfully performed surgeries for one young patient after another, summarizing valuable treatment experiences.

Beyond Monetary Measurement

Zuo Yuzeng treats patients regardless of their wealth.

A 21-year-old woman, Zhao Defen, suffered from congenital torticollis. Her mother was paralyzed, her sister was lame, and her brother was blind. The heavy burden of life fell on Zhao Defen. She brought a bag of dry food to seek medical help from Zuo Yuzeng. Zuo Yuzeng treated her as his own family, curing her disease for free.

A wealthy couple from Hong Kong brought a large sum of money to seek medical help for their son. Zuo Yuzeng treated the disease impartially, not charging extra after the cure. The couple were deeply moved: "Our son's twisted neck was the heartache of our entire family. We spent $20,000 abroad without a cure, but here, it was cured with just over 300 yuan."

Zuo Yuzeng has treated tens of thousands of patients, never accepting any gifts from them, but he received letters filled with sincere gratitude.

A young woman from Baotou and her newlywed husband took a day-long train ride to personally deliver wedding candy to him.

A young man from Xiaoyi sent a wedding photo after surgery, following the local custom. Originally, he had a twisted neck during his wedding and had to adjust the photo position according to his neck; now he could finally "correct the chaos."

A person who was rejected by universities before surgery sent a thank-you letter from the university after the surgery.

    为患者觅回青春容颜
    ——记斜颈病专家左玉增
    刘振起　鲁恺
    李秀英是个纯朴的农村姑娘，从小患有先天性斜颈病，影响容貌的美观。父母亲带着她四出求医，却没有办法矫治。就在她万念俱灰之际，遇到了军医左玉增，治好了她的斜颈病，也抚平了她心头的创伤。她投书《大同日报》，感激解放军同志的恩情。
    左玉增是地处山西省大同市的52875部队医院院长、副主任医师。他1980年开始研究治疗斜颈病，先后成功地治愈1500多例。
    中国医学科学院整形外科医院院长、一级教授宋儒耀这样评价左玉增：“你对斜颈病的研究和治疗，在国内独一无二，手术之多、成功率之高在世界上也是罕见的。”
    逼出来的第一刀
    左玉增研治斜颈病的开端，颇具喜剧性，然而又带有庄重的色彩。
    1980年春，正值计划生育工作的高潮。受部队驻地政府之邀，当时任卫生队长的左玉增带领医疗队到农村做绝育手术。
      “多子多福”的陈旧观念像链条一样紧箍着农民的头脑，尽管他们挨家串户反复宣传，三天内仍未获进展。第四天，他们来到农民杨某家，杨某夫妇生有三个孩子，符合绝育条件。一番宣传后，万没想到杨妻一口答应：“可以做手术，不过，先要治好我男人的歪脖子。”
    好一个交换条件！杨某歪脖子30多年，多方求治不愈。这给他们出了一个不大不小的难题，左玉增在教科书上没学过，实践中没做过。但一个共产党员为落实“基本国策”作贡献的使命感，一个医生解除病人痛苦的责任感，驱使着他下决心攻克这一难关！
    好下的决心，难干的事业。治疗斜颈病要在颈部手术，颈部神经丰富，血管集中，加之农村医疗条件差，人命攸关！左玉增含辛茹苦走访医院，拜师求教，查找资料，潜心钻研，手术方案改了修、修了改。多少个日日夜夜苦思暝想后，他凝神聚意，划开了治愈斜颈病的一刀。
    他成功了！
    杨家感动不已，杨妻第一个施术绝育。这消息就像顺风刮过来的叶子，呼啦一片，全乡绝育任务超额完成。
    斜颈病较为常见，但致病原因并不尽相同。左玉增常年累月牺牲休息时间，常常顾不上吃饭、休息，成功地摸索了一整套医治肌性斜颈病的新方法。以后，他又闯入痉挛性斜颈病的研究中。痉挛性斜颈的治疗难度远远大于肌性斜颈病，但他靠着顽强的毅力也攻克下来了。
    患者痛苦重于医生名声
    云南省某县水利局陈工程师突然患了痉挛性斜颈病。作为一个靠眼睛测量的人，这个病得的真不是个地方。脖子歪了，颜面畸形，视线不能按测量要求聚焦，只好歇工跑医院。北京跑了，上海跑了，昆明、广州、武汉也跑了，手术也做了，病仍未治愈。还是左玉增使他颈正如初，重新扛起了测量仪。
    国内外专家认为，成人斜颈不宜治疗，如治将易出现复视，左玉增不囿于专家之说，勇于探索，对手术精益求精，先后治愈成人斜颈病600余例，经过追访，无一人出现复视。
    斜颈病人由于不能及时治愈，多数伴有颜面畸形。脖子正了，颜面畸形得不到根治，仍不尽如人意。为此，左玉增把探索的目光对准了斜颈病人颜面整形的空白点。1987年，左玉增应邀到桂林、无锡讲学。甲天下的山水失去了诱惑力，左玉增一头扎进美容医院，足不出屋，虚心学习。回来后，借鉴整容美容技术，他首次使斜颈病人颜面畸形得到治疗。
    为患斜颈病的婴儿作手术要冒很大的风险，一但出现意外，就会名声扫地。但左玉增考虑的是尽早解除患者的病痛。他说：“名声无所谓，为后人趟条路子，为医学事业作出自己的贡献，是我应尽的义务。”
    他就是以这种高尚的职业情操，为前来求医的一个个幼小儿童成功地做了手术，并总结出宝贵的治疗经验。
    用金钱无法计量的
    治病救人，左玉增不分贫富。
    21岁的女青年赵德芬患先天性斜颈病，母亲瘫痪，嫂子瘸腿，哥哥双目失明，沉重的生活负担全落在赵德芬身上。她带着一袋干粮求医左玉增。左玉增把她当作自己的亲人看待，免费为她治好了病。
    香港富商曾某夫妇携巨款为其子求医，左玉增因病而医，一视同仁，治愈后不多收分厘。富商夫妇感慨不已：“孩子脖子歪是我们全家的心病，在国外花两万元没有治好，在你们这里用300多元就手到病除了。”
    左玉增医治病人成千上万，从不接收病人送来的任何礼物，却收到了一封封饱含真挚情意的来信。
    包头一女青年和新婚丈夫坐了一天的火车，专程给他送来了喜糖。
    孝义一青年手术后，按家乡风俗补照了结婚相，寄给左玉增。原来他结婚时脖子歪，顺其脖子歪的方向变换了照相位置；如今才得已“拨乱反正”。
    13人手术前被拒于高校门外，手术后在大学给左玉增寄来了感谢信。
