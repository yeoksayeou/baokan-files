The first Sunday of September is "Labor Day" in the United States.

Recently, the American Safety and Health at Work Research Institute revealed in its annual "Labor Day" report that among major industrialized countries, the United States has the highest rate of work-related deaths, with an average of one death or severe injury for every 11 workers. The likelihood of an American worker dying from a work-related injury is 36 times higher than that of a Swede and 9 times higher than that of a Briton.

The United States sees over 10,000 work-related deaths annually, resulting in an economic loss of $15 billion each year. The likelihood of an American worker sustaining a severe injury at work is far greater than the likelihood of developing cancer from smoking two packs of cigarettes daily.

The institute's executive director, Kinney, pointed out: "The facts show that the United States is making fewer and fewer efforts to reduce work-related deaths." The "Labor Day" report calls on the government and private sector to increase investment to ensure that American workers have a safer working environment.

    工伤死亡之冠
    9月的头一个星期日是美国的“劳动节”。
    最近，美国安全工作环境研究所在其每年例行的“劳动节”报告中透露，在主要工业化国家里，美国的工伤死亡率高于其他国家，平均每11个工人中就有一个丧命或重伤。一个美国工人死于工伤的可能性是瑞典人的36倍，是英国人的9倍。
    美国每年死于工伤的人数逾万，由此给国民经济造成的损失每年达150亿美元。美国工人在工作时受重伤的可能性远远大于他每天吸两包烟而致癌的可能性。
    该机构的执行所长金尼指出：“事实表明，美国在减少工伤死亡方面所做出的努力越来越少。”“劳动节”报告呼吁政府和私人部门下大力气增加投资，以保障美国工人在更安全的环境里工作。
