Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 8th

A vehicle that has traveled a long distance will drive into a designated parking spot, and three spray heads on tracks will automatically spray high-pressure water jets. After 1 minute, the car, which was originally covered in dust, will be washed clean.

This high-pressure water jet vehicle washing equipment, designed and manufactured by Shanghai Jianghua Ship Repair Engineering Company, fills a domestic gap.

Currently, approximately 20,000 vehicles enter Shanghai's urban area daily through 10 checkpoints. Relevant departments plan to install this washing equipment at these 10 checkpoints.

    上海入市区主要路口将安装车辆清洗设备
    据新华社上海11月8日电  （记者冯亦珍）一辆经过长途跋涉的车辆驶入预定车位，3个在轨道上滑行的喷头就会自动向车辆喷射高压水流。1分钟后，这辆本来积满灰尘的汽车，就被冲刷得干干净净。
    由上海江华船舶修理工程公司自行设计、制造的这种高压水细射流车辆清洗设备，填补了国内空白。
    目前，每天大约有两万辆汽车分别从10个道口进入上海市区。有关部门计划在这10个道口都安装这种清洗设备。
