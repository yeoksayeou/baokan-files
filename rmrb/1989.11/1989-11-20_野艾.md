After the windy and warm spring, the Shaanbei highlands enter a long dry season. The highlands pant heavily under the heatwaves, but the wild mugwort still thrives vigorously during this season.

Wild mugwort, also known as mugwort, grows wild in fields, ditches, barren slopes, roadsides, and those damp river valleys and low-lying areas. The vast and sprawling lands of the Shaanbei highlands are filled with this perennial herb.

As you stroll leisurely through the fields, hills, and wilderness, you will immediately sense a refreshing bitter fragrance in the air. The wind gently rolls through the valleys, freely spreading the scent. You can't help but stop, pluck a stem of wild mugwort, and inhale its aroma. You might exclaim softly, as if discovering it for the first time: "Ah, it smells so good!" Then, you carefully roll it in your hands, savoring the moment as you linger there.

This is a unique and charming bitter fragrance, different from all other flowers and grasses.

The people of the highlands have a deep bond with the wild mugwort. Generation after generation, they have repeated ancient and rich customs related to the mugwort, along with many mysterious and wondrous practices.

In the early summer during the Dragon Boat Festival, the wild mugwort is about a foot tall, still fresh and vibrant from the spring. Its slender, feather-like leaves are covered with a layer of silvery-gray fuzz, gently swaying in the southeast wind. At dawn, people eagerly gather mugwort with dew drops from the riverside and slopes to bring back home—hanging them in a cross pattern above the door to ward off evil and misfortune. They also wake their children early, clean their eyes, and tuck a sprig of mugwort into their ear creases. For girls, they tie a small pouch around their necks with five-colored threads, containing grains, iron filings, and mugwort leaves, symbolizing the removal of disasters and the prevention of pests.

The people of the highlands pour their sacred and sincere love into the wild mugwort through their customs. The smoke from burning mugwort can repel mosquitoes and flies. From May onwards, farmers start making rough mugwort ropes to deal with those pesky mosquitoes. The mugwort smoke, carrying a fragrant aroma, accompanies the harmonious nightly conversations of the farming families as they drift into dreams. Mugwort can also be used in medicine. Locals say, "Mugwort can be paired with a hundred remedies." Folk remedies use it to nourish blood, warm the uterus, and dispel cold and dampness. Dried and ground mugwort leaves are used as moxa for acupuncture. In the remote, impoverished, and backward Shaanbei highlands, where medicine and doctors have always been scarce, farming families have passed down many secret mugwort remedies: for children's hernias, abdominal pain, and bad habits like thumb-sucking, they use mugwort fluff mixed with musk or garlic to apply moxibustion to the affected areas. For dysentery, they boil mugwort leaves with ginger and a little red sugar to treat it...

Perhaps it is the powerful functions of the wild mugwort that give it a refined and ethereal aura.

As the season moves into June on the highlands, the sky is clear and blue, and the sun burns like a flame. The crops are almost hopelessly parched, so the farmers capture beetles everywhere. These are large, copper-green beetles that buzz like bombers in the summer wilderness and sometimes fly into homes at night. Once caught, they choose the brightest and hottest midday to stick mugwort fluff on the beetle's back and light it on fire, then release it to fly into the sky. The beetle, tormented by the mugwort fire, will fly as high as it can, leaving trails of light in the sky. This fire from the mugwort is called "heavenly fire." They use the beetle to send a mysterious "heavenly fire" message to God: "Merciful God, have pity on the suffering people. The entire earth is burning and cannot sustain life. Even the mugwort, which is not afraid of drought and thirst, can no longer endure it..."

The ancient and pure-hearted people of the highlands forever send this message of despair and uncertainty, yet they live so fully and tenaciously.

After the long, hot, and dry summer, the highlands enter the rainy season of autumn. The autumn mist gallops like wild horses, revealing the farmers and oxen sowing wheat in the mountains and fields. At this time, the wild mugwort begins to bloom, embodying great love and maturity. The slightly curved branches are filled with dense, small, and delicate yellow flower clusters, spreading warmth, bitter fragrance, and singing their own love and praise with the autumn wind. Standing on the highlands and gazing at this natural scene will evoke many free and unrestrained associations, bringing a sense of supreme joy to both vision and spirit.

Ah, the wild, bitter-smelling mugwort growing in the fields, ditches, barren slopes, roadsides, and low-lying areas, all bloom for the vast, free, and noble land. The people of Shaanbei highlands eternally love this lush and ubiquitous wild mugwort.

    野艾
    史小溪
    多风而温馨的春天一过，陕北高原便进入漫长的干旱季节。高原在热浪中沉重地喘息，可野艾还是在这季节蓬蓬勃勃地生长起来了。
    野艾，亦叫艾蒿，野生在田畔、沟道、荒坡、路边及那些潮湿的河谷洼地。陕北高原广阔纵横的土地上，到处遍布着这种多年生草本植物。
    迈着散漫的步子，你走过田畔、山坡和荒野，立刻会感到空气中流荡着清新的苦香。风顺着山谷舒卷地自由自在地弥漫，你不由得停下脚步，掐一枝野艾，闻闻，会像第一次才发现似的小声叫出声来：呀，好香！然后，把它轻轻放在手中珍爱地搓揉着，流连忘返地在那儿久久徜徉。
    这是和百花异草不同的一种独具风流的苦香。
    高原上的农人们和野艾有着相濡以沫的感情，他们祖祖辈辈一遍一遍重复着那些与野艾有关的古老浓郁的风俗和那些充满神奇奥妙的事情。
    初夏的端阳节，野艾仅一尺来高，还带着春天的鲜嫩、水灵，细长的羽状叶片披一层银灰色丝毛，在东南风中姗姗摇曳。黎明，人们便兴冲冲从河畔、坡地拔些挂露珠的野艾带回家——在住宅门檐上方交叉悬挂，驱祭五毒，共禳不祥。人们还要早早叫起自己的孩子，清洗双目，给耳缝间别枝艾叶；还要给女孩子脖颈间项链似的用五色彩线系一香包，香包里包有五谷、铁屑、艾叶诸物，寓意消除祸患，辟除蟊蠹危害之灾。
    高原人以自己的民俗习风，倾注于野艾一种神圣而忠厚的笃爱。野艾燃烧的烟能驱蚊蝇，从五月起，农家就开始束些粗糙的艾绳了，以对付那些厌恶的饕蚊。那艾烟袅袅地带着芳香，带着农家和谐袒露的夜话走进梦乡。野艾更可入药，当地有“艾可配百方”之说。民间偏方以它营血，暖子宫，祛寒湿。将艾叶晒干捣碎而成艾绒，中药针灸时用来治病。荒僻偏远贫穷落后的陕北高原古来缺医少药，农家便祖传盛行多种艾的秘方：小孩疝气、腹部疼痛、不良撮口习惯，皆用艾绒加麝香或大蒜在有关部位灸疗。赤痢白痢，则用艾叶加生姜和少许红糖煎服医治……
    许是野艾的强悍功能，才使高原人赋予它一身毓秀空灵之气吧。
    时令跨入六月的高原，长空青蓝、透明，太阳开始火焰一般燃烧。庄稼旱得几乎无望了，农人们便到处捕捉金龟子。那是一种铜绿色的大甲虫，在夏天旷野上轰炸机般地飞舞，有时会在夜晚嗡嗡地闯进家来。一把捉住，即选择最亮红酷烈的午晌，将艾绒粘其背上点燃，然后放飞，任其翱翔上苍。那金龟子因受着艾火煎熬，会没命地腾空而起，越飞越高，在空间留下一道道虚光。这艾绒点燃的火，称天火。他们托金龟子向上帝传递神秘的“天火”讯息：老天爷，慈悲受苦人吧，整个地面已燃烧得无法生存，连不畏干旱和饥渴的艾蒿都再难忍受了……
    古老淳厚的高原人，永远传递着这无望和未卜的寄托，又那样充实和顽强地活着。
    整个漫长燠热而干旱的炎夏过去以后，高原便进入多雨连绵的秋的岁月了。秋天的潮雾野马般地奔驰，显影似地洇出山野播种小麦的农人和耕牛。野艾在这时开始开花了，蕴藉着伟大的厚爱和成熟，微微弯曲的枝头挤满细密而小俏的米黄花序，扩散温馨，苦香，和着秋风唱着自己的热恋和礼赞。站在高原上凝望这派大自然景象，会使人许许多多的联想自由自在驰往，会使人的视觉和心灵都产生一种至高无上的愉悦。
    啊，田畔沟壑荒坡路边洼地的那些野生野长的苦香的野艾，尽是为着阔大、自由而高贵的土地开放的，繁衍在陕北高原上的农人们永恒不息地爱着这郁郁葱葱随处可见的野艾。
