Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, November 26th — (Reporter Gao Xin) The Changchun Municipal Bureau of Light Industry has taken decisive measures to tackle the widespread issue of personal debts to public funds within enterprises: by publicly announcing the debts, setting deadlines for repayment, and imposing economic penalties on defaulters, they have effectively plugged the "big leak" of enterprise funds being held in personal pockets.

For many years, the Changchun Municipal Light Industry System has seen a serious problem of employees defaulting on public funds. Statistics show that by the first half of this year, 80 out of 95% of the system's enterprises had employees owing a total of 1.594 million yuan in public funds. As a result, enterprises have been paying tens of millions of yuan annually in interest for these personal debts. In mid-August of this year, the Changchun Municipal Bureau of Light Industry made clearing up employees' debts to public funds a key measure to activate funds and promote clean governance among officials. They required officials to lead by example, announcing at a system-wide officials' meeting: those owing 300 yuan or less must repay by the end of this month; those owing between 300 and 1,000 yuan must repay by the end of October; and those owing more than 1,000 yuan must repay by the end of the year.

　　长春二轻局制止私欠公款
    据新华社长春11月26日电　（记者高欣）长春市二轻局采取果断措施，向企业内普遍存在的私欠公款现象“开刀”：张榜公布，限期收回，违者经济处罚，有效地堵住了企业资金滞留个人腰包的“大漏斗”。
    多年来，长春市二轻系统企业职工拖欠公款现象比较严重。据统计，到今年上半年，占全系统95％以上的80户企业职工拖欠公款达159.4万元。为此，企业每年光为个人付利息就达十几万元。今年8月中旬，长春市二轻局把清理职工欠公款作为活化资金、干部廉政的一项重要措施来抓。他们要求干部要以身作则，在全系统干部大会上公开宣布：私欠公款300元以下者，限本月底还清；300至1000元者，10月底还清；1000元以上者，年底前还清。
