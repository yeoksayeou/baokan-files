East German Government Spokesperson Criticizes Kohl's Ten-Point Plan
Stable Relations Between Two Germanys Essential for European Stability

BERLIN, Nov. 29 (Xinhua) — East German government spokesperson Mayer pointed out yesterday that the issue of German reunification should not be on the agenda. The so-called "federal union" can only be a union between two sovereign states.

Mayer commented on West German Chancellor Kohl's ten-point plan presented to the Federal Parliament yesterday, saying that this plan not only ignores reality but also easily causes confusion. It not only disregards the basis of the two Germanys' relations and the basic treaty but also disregards the clear provisions in the Helsinki Final Act regarding the sovereignty and independence of the two Germanys.

The East German government spokesperson pointed out that the relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany should start from mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and equality. The issue of so-called "reunification" should not be on the agenda. Anyone who seriously considers the issue of East and West will not want to change the balance of Europe. For the security and stability of Europe, the stability of relations between the two Germanys is a very important prerequisite.

Regarding Kohl's proposal for cooperation with East Germany, the spokesperson said that Kohl's idea does not include the factors of peace, security, and disarmament. Mayer emphasized that Mr. Kohl, when talking about establishing a so-called "federal structure," avoids clearly stating that this can only be a union between two sovereign states.

　　民德政府发言人指责科尔十点计划
　　两德关系稳定是欧洲稳定的前提
    本报柏林11月29日电　记者许宏治报道：民主德国政府发言人迈耶尔昨天指出，德国重新统一的问题提不到议事日程上来，所谓“邦联”只能是两个主权国家之间的邦联。
    迈耶尔对西德总理科尔昨天在联邦议会提出的10点计划发表评论说，这一计划不仅忽视了现实性，而且很容易引起混乱；它不仅无视两德关系，基础条约，而且无视赫尔辛基会议最后文件中关于两个德国主权和独立的明确规定。
    民德政府发言人指出，民主德国和联邦德国的关系应以相互尊重主权和领土完整及平等为出发点。所谓“重新统一”的问题提不到议事日程上来。东西方任何严肃考虑问题的人都不会愿意改变欧洲的平衡。对于欧洲的安全与稳定来说，两个德国之间关系的稳定是一个十分重要的前提。
    关于科尔提出的与民德合作的建议，这位发言人说，科尔的设想没有包括和平、安全与裁军的因素。迈耶尔强调指出，科尔先生在谈到建立所谓“邦联结构”时，回避明确说明，这只能是两个主权国家之间的邦联。
