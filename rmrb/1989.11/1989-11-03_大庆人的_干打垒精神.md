The "Dry Stack Spirit" of the People of Daqing

New China News Agency reporter Zǔ Bóguāng

In the autumn of 1972, I had come to Daqing. At that time, I stayed at the command center, which was just a "dry stack" with slightly better indoor furnishings. Driving through the vast oil field, rows of low "dry stacks" made me lose my sense of direction. If it weren't for the drilling rigs, this place wouldn't be much different from the "big villages" in Northeast China.

Seventeen years later, I saw a newly risen Daqing City. The former fourth-class Saertu Station had become so spacious and bright. The station square was bustling with cars and taxis, and the sound of shops and individual stalls selling goods was endless. Along both sides of the central Kalgari Avenue, beautiful buildings stood in rows. The 257-meter-high television tower, which is considered the tallest in the country, and the imposing modern sculptures, showed the grandeur of the people of Daqing. Surrounding the city center, either near or far, dense or sparse, were the "satellite cities" of residential buildings, like a mirage.

The times had changed. Was the "dry stack spirit" that the people of Daqing once took pride in still there? I was searching for it.

In the luxurious hall of the Dongfeng Hotel in Daqing, a few young people dressed in fashionable clothes were taking photos. Not far away, the dance hall was playing beautiful music. I approached the young people and asked where the "dry stacks" were. A young person looked at me in surprise and said, "The 'dry stacks' in the city have long been demolished as part of the slum renovation. If you are an archaeologist, you might still find some ruins in the distant suburbs. As for the five heroes of the past—Wang Jinxi, the Iron Man, has passed away; Zhu Hongchang and Duan Xingzhi have moved to other oil fields; Xue Guobang and Ma Deren have also retired."

I specially visited Xue Guobang. He lived in a two-story small house, which was far from comparable to the old "dry stacks" supported by a single pole. Opening the door, there were televisions and VCRs. He was lying on the sofa resting. This former first oil extraction team leader, suffering from severe back pain, had to take the bus to a distant place for massage. His wife, speaking in a thick Gansu accent, said, "This old man is so stubborn. I often tell him, 'It was hard in Yumen, it was hard in Daqing, why don't you get a car to go see the doctor!'” Old Xue said, "Everyone is busy. The car is for official business. We can no longer contribute to the oil field, so we shouldn't bother the leaders anymore."

At a drilling team relocation site, I met an old driver. He had been fighting on the front lines for 30 years since the battle began. Reflecting on the past and present, he sighed, "I now live in a three-bedroom apartment. But every time I pass by the 'dry stacks' I used to live in, I still go and take a look." The several elders present chimed in, saying, "Living in 'dry stacks' and hoping for improvement, after improvement, we still miss the 'dry stacks'."

In a place several dozen kilometers away from the city, there is an Oil Extraction Plant No. 4. This plant produces over 800 million tons of crude oil annually. Inside the residential area, beautiful office buildings, guesthouses, dormitories, and a lovely park give the impression of being "rich with oil." However, next to the building complex, there is a "broken house" stacked with discarded electrical machinery, valves, pipes, cables, and electrical equipment, known as the "extra warehouse," belonging to a mining repair team. The mine director, Song Rixin, introduced that these scraps of metal could fetch tens of thousands of yuan annually. In a simple room, I met the "old warrior" Sun Xianggui, the team leader. He said, "Daqing is rich. But money that shouldn't be spent, not a single cent should be spent. What is waste? A saw blade without teeth is waste. In our line of work, we can't walk with our heads held high; we have to pick up a nail or a screw lying on the ground. The scrap pile must be turned over dozens of times before it can be discarded." For 30 years, he has been on this post, coming early every day and leaving late, just like living his life. Under his silent influence, all the young team leaders in the team have adopted this work ethic.

Young station master Zhai Qiuping of the Xingshugang First Combined Station told me a thought-provoking story: The station's task is to separate oil and water, which requires the use of expensive demulsifiers. The "old warriors" would not bear to waste the residual liquid in the barrels, saving one kilogram each time by heating and rinsing the barrels, amounting to over 300 kilograms per person per year. Young people, inspired by the spirit of the "old warriors," successfully experimented with the "orthogonal test method" in three months, saving 36 tons of demulsifiers annually, worth nearly 200,000 yuan. The "old warrior" Guo Zongming was delighted like a child: "You have culture and do big things, I have no culture and do small things. This barrel I still have to rinse!" In the questionnaire survey, under the column "The person you admire the most," young people still wrote the names of three "old warriors."

At the hotel, a Daqing colleague showed me several color photos. Initially, I thought they were oil sculptures or southern root carvings. Upon closer inspection, I saw human eyes. He told me that this was an underground worker, a very handsome young man. He hesitated to show these works, fearing the appearance of "An oil worker's roar, finding a wife without a household registration."

The color photos prompted me to meet these young "oil sculptures."

At the 1205 Drilling Team, where the Iron Man Wang Jinxi used to be, the living conditions had greatly improved compared to what I saw 17 years ago, with air conditioning and shower rooms. The drilling rigs were imported from abroad, no longer requiring manual labor. Party secretary Li Yinsheng told me that although the conditions had improved, outdoor operations were still arduous. In summer, there are many mosquitoes, and the drillers have to smear mud on their faces, looking like mud monkeys. When it rains, their clothes get soaked, and they have to wear them wet for the next shift. These young people, who have never seen the face of the Iron Man, were initially enthusiastic, but after a few months, their fair faces turned into a tea egg color, no longer as handsome. But with the spirit of the Iron Man and the old traditions, the collective is united and harmonious.

The 12th team leader of the Iron Man's team, Shen Guan, was busy directing the lifting operation. Amidst the roar, he told me that our team's young people both uphold traditions and innovate. When it rains, the roads are muddy, and the trucks carrying materials are parked several miles away, yet they still have to rush to carry them by hand. Since 1985, we have won the Petroleum Department's gold medal three times in a row, and this year we have entered the national double civilization first-class team.

In the company known as the "oil field doctors," I met the party secretary of the Third Brigade, Qin Zhaoxiang. He provided the following figures: Out of the company's 3,968 young workers, 70% are fighting on the front lines, dedicating themselves to the country's oil production as "oil sculptures." In winter, when repairing wells, oil sprays onto their bodies and freezes instantly. When entering the house, you knock me, I knock you, the cotton pants can't bend, humorously describing themselves as "oil barrels, oil brains, oil necks, with oil lunch boxes tucked in their waists." Such arduous work, very few people request transfers. They also don't have difficulty finding partners because the girls admire men who dare to strive.

During my stay in Daqing, I did not find the "dry stacks" of the past, but I was fortunate to find the most precious thing: the "dry stack spirit" of the people of Daqing.

### 大庆人的“干打垒精神”

    大庆人的“干打垒精神”
    新华社记者　祖伯光
    1972年秋天。我曾来过大庆。当时住在指挥部，那不过是室内陈设稍好的“干打垒”。驱车行驶在广漠的油田，一排排低矮的“干打垒”，使我转得不知东南西北。如果没有井架，这里与东北的“大屯子”没什么两样。
    十七年后，我看到的是新崛起的大庆市。昔日四等的萨尔图车站变得那么宽敞明亮，车站广场汽车、出租车穿梭如流，商店、个体商亭叫卖声不绝；市中心卡尔加里大道两旁，漂亮的楼房鳞次栉比。堪称全国之最的高257米的电视铁塔和颇具雄风的现代派雕塑，显示出大庆人的气魄。围绕市中心或远或近或疏或密的“卫星城”楼群，像海市蜃楼。
    时代变迁了。当年大庆人引为光荣的“干打垒”精神还在吗？我寻觅着。
    在大庆东风宾馆的豪华大厅，几个穿着时髦的青年人正在拍照。不远处舞厅传来优美的舞曲。我趋前问青年人，哪里还有“干打垒”？一位青年惊异地望望我说，市区的“干打垒”，早被当做棚户区改造了。你如果是考古学家，说不定在远郊还能找到断壁残墙。至于说当年的五大“标兵”、铁人王进喜早已去世；朱洪昌、段兴枝转战其他油田；薛国邦、马德仁也已年老退休了。
    我特意拜访了薛国邦。他住在一幢两层小楼里，已非当年用一根棍支起的马架子房、“干打垒”所能比拟的。推开家门，电视机、录放机一应俱全。他正躺在沙发上休息。这位当年油田上第一个采油队长，得下的严重腰疼病在折磨着他。有时要挤公共汽车到很远的地方去按摩。他的老伴操一口浓重的甘肃话说：“这老头挺倔。我常劝他，在玉门苦，在大庆苦，你就不会要个小车去看病！”老薛说：“大家都很忙。车有公事。咱已不能为油田贡献什么了，还能老给领导添麻烦？”
    在一处钻井队搬家现场，我遇上一位老司机。他从会战开始已整整在前线奋斗了30年。抚今追昔，他感慨地说：“我现在已住上了三室一厅的楼房。可每次路过我住过的‘干打垒’，总要去瞧瞧。”在场的几位老师傅你一言我一语地说，住“干打垒”盼改善，改善了又想“干打垒”。
    在离市区几十公里外，有一个采油四厂。这个厂年产800多万吨原油。居民小区内，漂亮的办公楼、招待所、宿舍楼，美丽的公园，给人印象是“富得流油”。可就在楼群旁有个“破大家”，堆放着废旧的电机、阀门、管线、电缆、电器，人称“编外仓库”，是一矿的维修队。矿长宋日新介绍说，这些破铜烂铁，每年能捣腾十几万元。在一间简易的平房里，我见到了“老会战”孙祥贵队长。他说：“大庆是富了。可不该花的钱就是一分钱也不能花。什么叫废？一个锯条没牙才叫废。干我们这一行，头不能扬着走，看到地上有一根钉子一个螺丝疙瘩也得捡起来。废料堆不翻腾几十遍就不能当废料拉走。”30年来，他在这个岗位上像过日子一样，每天总是早来转一圈，最后一个收工。在他无声的影响下，全队十几个年轻的班长都是这个作风。
    杏树岗第一联合站年轻的站长翟秋平，向我讲了一件令人深思的事：站上的任务是让油水分离，这要加很贵的破乳剂。“老会战”们加破乳剂不忍让桶里的残液浪费，每次加温涮桶节约一公斤，一人一年节约300多公斤。有文化的青年人在“老会战”精神鼓舞下，用3个月的时间试验成功了“正交试验法”，每年可节约36吨破乳剂，价值近20万元。“老会战”郭宗明高兴得像个孩子：“你们有文化搞大的，我没文化搞小的。这桶我还得涮！”青年们在问卷调查“你最崇敬的人”一栏中，还是写上了3个“老会战”的名字。
    在宾馆住地，大庆同行让我看过几张彩照。最初我以为是油塑或南方的根雕。细看有人的眼睛。他告诉我这就是井下作业工人，是个很漂亮的小伙子。他不忍心发这样的作品，怕出现“石油工人一声吼，找个老婆没户口”。
    彩照促使我去见那些“油塑泥雕”的青年。
    在铁人王进喜生前所在的1205钻井队，生活条件比我17年前所见已大为改观，有了空调和洗澡间。钻机是从国外引进的，再不用人拉肩扛了。党支部书记李银生对我说，条件是改善了，但野外作业仍然艰苦。夏天蚊虫多，钻工们要用泥浆把脸糊上，像个泥猴子。遇上下雨衣服全湿透，不等干就得穿上倒班。这些连铁人面也没见着的青年人刚来时兴冲冲，几个月下来小白脸变成茶蛋色，没那时帅了。但有铁人精神，有铁人的老传统，集体团结和谐。
    第12任铁人队队长申冠，正忙着指挥吊装。他在隆隆声中告诉我，我们队的青年人既讲传统又讲创新。天下雨道路泥泞，拉运器材的汽车放在几里以外，还得争分夺秒人拉肩扛。从1985年起我们夺得石油部金牌三连冠，今年又跨入国家双文明一级队行列。
    在被人称为“油田医生”的井下作业公司，我见到了三大队的党委书记秦兆祥。他提供了这样的数字：全公司3968名青年工人有70％战斗在第一线，为祖国献石油甘当“油塑”。冬季修井油喷到身上马上冻硬了。进屋你敲我，我敲你，棉裤打不了弯，幽默地形容自己是“油桶、油脑、油脖子，腰里夹着油饭盒子”。这样艰苦的工作，很少有人要求调离。他们找对象也不难。因为姑娘们崇拜勇于拚搏的男子汉。
    在大庆的日子里，我没有寻觅到当年的“干打垒”，但庆幸地找到最宝贵的东西：大庆人的“干打垒精神”。
