I heard a piece of news: A certain middle school conducted a test on students about the "Lei Feng spirit." A significant number of students did not know who Lei Feng was or what the Lei Feng spirit is. Some students even said that Lei Feng is a foreigner. These answers that make one laugh and cry reflect some issues in the promotion of learning from Lei Feng and carrying forward the Lei Feng spirit in recent years.

It is said that at the West Point Military Academy in the United States, Lei Feng is respected as the "best soldier of the contemporary era"; in the Netherlands, there is a "cowboy Lei Feng"; in France, there is an "elderly Lei Feng." However, in Lei Feng's hometown, some people regard those who learn from Lei Feng as "fools," and the Lei Feng spirit is deemed outdated. A careful reader collected some publicly reported incidents of "Lei Feng" from newspapers and magazines: A worker named Xiao Siyue from the Construction Company in Changsha, Hunan, caught a thief on a public bus, and the Changsha Public Transportation Police Division locked him up with the thief. A young worker named Dong Shangbin from the Jiangling Shoe Factory in Hubei found the owner of a television he picked up off the street, and the county public security bureau interrogated him as a suspected thief. There are also instances where "Lei Feng" jumped into the water to save someone, only to have his clothes and money stolen by people on the shore; "Lei Feng" took an injured person to the hospital, and after the person recovered, he sneaked away, leaving "Lei Feng" in debt...

The examples mentioned here might be somewhat extreme, and the facts described certainly do not represent the true essence of today's society. However, it is undeniable that the promotion of the Lei Feng spirit has not been as strong in recent years.

"I will learn from Lei Feng, the good example," I grew up in a schoolyard singing this song. I hope our next generation will also grow up singing this song, encouraged by the Lei Feng spirit, to become people of high moral character.

    应该高唱学雷锋的歌
    听到一则消息：某中学就“雷锋精神”对学生进行了测试，有相当一部分学生不知道雷锋和雷锋精神，还有的学生说雷锋是外国人。这些令人哭笑不得的回答反映了前些年在宣传雷锋、学习雷锋、发扬雷锋精神方面的一些问题。
    据说，在美国西点军校，雷锋被敬为“当代最佳军人”；荷兰出现“牛仔雷锋”；法国有“老年雷锋”。但在雷锋的故乡，有些人却把学雷锋的人当作“二百五”，雷锋精神被贬为过时。有位细心的读者搜集了一些报刊公开报道的“雷锋”遭遇：湖南长沙市建筑公司工人肖思跃，在公共汽车上抓小偷，市公交公安分局把他和扒手关在一起。湖北江陵制鞋厂青年工人董尚斌，路拾彩电寻找失主，县公安部门把他作为盗窃嫌疑犯加以审讯。还有，“雷锋”下水救人了，衣服、钱被岸上的人洗劫一空；“雷锋”把伤者送到医院，病愈后伤者偷偷跑了，“雷锋”成了负债人……
    这里所举的例子也许有些极端，所叙述的事实当然不能代表今天社会本质的真实，但是，这些年对雷锋精神的宣传不那么有力却是不可否认的。
    “学习雷锋好榜样”，我是在这种歌声的校园里长大的。愿我们的下一代也唱着这支歌成长，在雷锋精神的鼓励下，做道德高尚的人。
