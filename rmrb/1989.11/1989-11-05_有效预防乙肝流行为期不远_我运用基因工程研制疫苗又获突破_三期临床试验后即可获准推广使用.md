Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 4th — (Reporter Lù Guóyuán) The day when China uses its own developed and produced genetic engineering vaccines to prevent hepatitis B infection and outbreaks is not far away. The "hepatitis B recombinant vaccinia virus genetic engineering vaccine" jointly developed by scientific workers from Shanghai and Beijing has successfully passed the second phase of clinical trials, proving to have no adverse reactions on the human body and a significantly higher effectiveness rate than blood-derived vaccines. After the third phase of clinical trials—mother-infant blockage trials—it can be widely promoted for use.

Hepatitis B is a highly infectious disease in China, and so far, there are no effective drugs to treat and control its spread. Once vaccinated, people can be free from the troubles of this highly harmful disease, which is what people have long been hoping for. China currently produces hepatitis B blood-derived vaccines, but the global trend is to replace them with better genetic engineering vaccines.

The clinical trials are about to enter the third phase—mother-infant blockage trials, which means using the vaccine to block the transmission of the virus from the mother to the newborn. After the trials are completed, the vaccine can be put into industrial production.

    有效预防乙肝流行为期不远
    我运用基因工程研制疫苗又获突破
    三期临床试验后即可获准推广使用
    据新华社上海11月4日电　（记者陆国元）我国用自己研制和生产的基因工程疫苗预防乙型肝炎感染与流行的日子，已经为期不远了。上海、北京科学工作者合作研制的“乙型肝炎重组痘苗病毒基因工程疫苗”，已顺利通过二期临床试验，证明对人体没有任何不良反应，有效率明显高于血源疫苗。在进行三期临床试验——母婴阻断试验后，即可大量推广使用。
    乙型肝炎在我国是一种发病率很高的传染性疾病，并且迄今尚无有效药物医治和控制其流行。一经接种疫苗就能免受这种对健康危害极大的疾病困扰，是人们企盼已久的。我国目前已能生产乙型肝炎血源疫苗，但世界发展趋势将为更好的基因工程疫苗取代。
    临床试验即将进入第三期——母婴阻断试验，即用疫苗阻断母体对新生婴儿的病毒传染。试验结束后，即可投入工业化生产。
