	Drivers Entering Beijing Have a Driving Guide
	According to reports, tens of thousands of vehicles from outside Beijing enter and exit the city every day. Among these drivers, some are not familiar with Beijing's road conditions and are not fully aware of the things they need to pay attention to. Coupled with the large number of motor vehicles within the city, traffic violations and accidents frequently occur.

	The Beijing Municipal Public Security Traffic Management Bureau, in order to ensure the traffic safety of the capital, organized relevant personnel to compile and illustrate the "Handbook for Out-of-Town Drivers Entering Beijing" and the "Beijing Driving Guide." These were recently published by the Beijing Daily Press and distributed nationwide, and have been warmly welcomed by drivers.

　　进京司机有了行车指南
    本报讯据悉，每天有几万辆外地车辆进出北京。他们中有的司机对北京的道路情况不熟，对需注意的事项不甚了解，加上市内的机动车辆又多，时常出现违章事故。
    北京市公安交通管理局从保障首都的交通安全出发，组织有关人员编绘了《外地进京司机手册》和《北京行车指南》，最近由北京日报出版社出版并向全国发行，受到了司机们的欢迎。　（虎子）
