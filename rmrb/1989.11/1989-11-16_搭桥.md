Title: Building Bridges

In the rugged mountains of Laiyuan County, Hebei Province, the Juema River meanders through the landscape. Whenever the sun rises quietly from behind the mountains, the winding mountain roads are filled with groups of young women dressed in fashionable attire, riding shiny bicycles, chatting and laughing as they head towards the Beijing Military Region's direct-subordinate warehouse.

Hundreds of bicycles form a single line, which might not be remarkable on Beijing's Chang'an Street. But in this secluded mountain area, it is a sight that captivates the locals who are used to riding donkeys.

“Who would have thought that a sewing factory could be like popcorn, with a little investment yielding a big impact?” said Zhang Guijun, the head of Longmenkou Township.

“Ever since these girls started working at the factory, the village has undergone significant changes,” said Meng Qingshu, the director of the Board of Directors of Banchecheng Village. He counted on his fingers: “First, incomes have increased; one person can earn as much as three. Second, late marriages and late childbearing have become more common, making family planning easier. Third, family relationships have improved, children are more filial, and couples argue less. Fourth, the girls dress more fashionably, raising the standards for finding a partner. Young men have to work harder and learn new skills, as the saying goes, ‘The new wave pushes the old, and the boys chase the girls.’ Fifth, even the habits of urinating and spitting anywhere have decreased, and people who swear have become fewer.”

Meng Qingshu hadn't finished his “Longmenkou” speech when three young women rode by on bicycles. They were the three daughters of Wang Xiutian from Longmenkou Village. The political commissar of the unit, Zhu Fengming, said, “The Wang family was very poor before. Their three daughters couldn't even afford a single piece of colorful clothing. Now look at them, they look just like city girls!”

It is said that 31 people from Banchecheng Village work at the sewing factory, and now 28 of their families have bought television sets.

Television sets? In the eyes of city dwellers, this is a very ordinary thing. But Banchecheng Village is an old revolutionary base deep in the mountains. The “North China Land Work Conference” was held here in 1947. The decision-makers of that time discussed how to redistribute land and property. Today, leaders living in Beijing are constantly concerned about whether the living standards of the people in the old revolutionary base have improved and whether they have televisions to watch.

The sewing factory, run by a certain military unit, is specifically for producing shoe uppers for the Beijing Rubber Factory. To be precise, it is a workshop of the Beijing Rubber Factory, a link in the large-scale production of shoes. In the 1950s and 1960s, the factory mainly produced Liberation shoes and Force shoes for domestic consumption. In recent years, it has shifted to mainly producing for export. At the recent closing of the Canton Fair, they signed a contract worth more than one million US dollars with foreign businesses.

The shoe uppers made by the mountain girls, once assembled into shoes, will be shipped to the five continents. When the mountain people heard the factory representative's introduction, they were astonished!

The mountain people never imagined that the Beijing Rubber Factory is a base for producing athletic shoes for national athletes. Li Lingwei and Han Jian, who play badminton, He Zhiliang and Cao Yanhua, who play table tennis, the national women's and men's volleyball teams, the national football team, and even the giant Mu Tiezhu's size 50 athletic shoes, all have their labor! Almost one-third of the rubber shoes produced by the Beijing Rubber Factory are sent there.

How did they come up with such a good idea? Political Commissar Zhu introduced, “Our unit has been stationed in the mountains for a long time and has deep feelings for the mountain people. We have both poverty alleviation tasks and are spiritual civilization construction units with nearby villages. Initially, we also thought of some methods and had some effects, but they were limited to ‘mutual assistance’ and could not fundamentally change the face of the mountains. Our own families also could not be settled. In 1985, by chance, with the suggestion of the Beijing Rubber Factory, we started this sewing factory. The factory's output value was only 25,000 yuan in the first year, but by October of this year, it has already completed 670,000 yuan in output value. The number of workers has increased to 300, and it has a small scale. The seed we planted in the mountains has proven its vitality in practice.”

The factory is located in the camp area, and the workers live like soldiers, united and tense, lively but orderly. The deputy factory director of the rubber factory, Pan, showed us the bicycle shed for the workers. Hundreds of bicycles are neatly arranged in two rows. The deputy factory director asked us, “Doesn't it look like two rows of soldiers standing at attention?” “Yes, it does,” several people answered simultaneously. Political Commissar Zhu said, “Those who come here to work also include some children of local cadres who eat commercial grain. They say: sending children here is reassuring.”

There are many bridges over the Juema River, but this time, the bridge built from the city to the countryside, from industry to agriculture, is constructed by the local garrison.

    搭桥
    本报记者  吴昊
    在河北省涞水县的丛峦峻岭中，拒马河蜿蜒而下。每当太阳从山那面悄然升起，弯弯曲曲的山间公路上，总有一队队穿着讲究、打扮入时的女青年，骑着锃亮的自行车，说说笑笑向北京军区司令部直属某仓库驻地涌来。
    几百辆自行车成鱼贯之势，这在北京的长安街上可能算不了什么。但在这闭塞的山区，却使得骑惯了毛驴的山里人感到极大兴趣。
      “真没想到，缝纫厂就像爆米花，投入一点点，影响一大片。”龙门口乡乡长张桂军说。
      “这些丫头一进厂，村子里发生了大变化，”板城村村民委员会主任孟庆树扳着指头说：“收入增加了，一个顶三个挣，这是一；晚婚晚育的多了，计划生育好做了，这是二；家庭关系和睦了，儿女孝顺了，两口子吵架的少了，这是三；丫头们打扮漂亮了，找对象的条件高了，小伙子们再不上进，不学点本事不行了，‘长江后浪推前浪，小子赶着丫头上’，这是四；最后一条，村里就连随地大小便、随地吐痰的都少了，满嘴带脏字的人也少了。”
    孟庆树的“龙门阵”还没有摆完，三个女青年骑着自行车过来了，她们是龙门口村王秀田的三个女儿，部队政委朱凤鸣说：“老王家原来很穷，三个水葱似的闺女连件花衣服也买不起，如今你看，她们多像城里人哪！”
    据说板城村共有31个人在缝纫厂里上班，如今28个人的家里买了电视机。
    电视机算啥！在城里人看来，这是极平常的东西。但板城村是深山中的老区，1947年
  “华北土地工作会议”就是在这里召开的。当年的决策者在这里商量的是打土豪、分田地，而今住在北京的领导可是天天都在关心老区人民的生活提高了没有？有没有电视看？
    某部队办的缝纫厂是专门为北京橡胶厂生产鞋帮的。确切地说，它是北京橡胶厂的一个车间，是制鞋大流水作业中的一个环节。这个厂五六十年代只生产解放鞋、力士鞋，内销为主。这几年以外销为主了，在不久前闭幕的广交会上，他们厂和外商签订了一百余万美元的供货合同。
    山里妹子制做的鞋帮，做成鞋后，会飞向五大洲，山沟沟能和世界有联系，当山里人听到工厂代表的介绍以后，真是惊得目瞪口呆！
    山里人更没有想到，北京橡胶厂是专为国家运动员生产运动鞋的基地。打羽毛球的李玲蔚、韩健，打乒乓球的何志良、曹燕华，国家女排、男排，国家足球队，就连巨人穆铁柱穿的50号运动鞋，都有他们的劳动！北京橡胶厂生产的胶鞋差不多有1／3都是从这里运去的。
    怎么就想出了这么个好点子呢？朱政委介绍说，我们部队长期驻山区，和山区人民的感情很深，我们既有扶贫任务，又和附近几个村是精神文明共建单位，开始时也想了些办法，起了一些作用，但仅局限于“互相帮助”上，不能根本改变山区的面貌，我们自己的家属也得不到安置，1985年，一个偶然的机会，在北京橡胶厂的提示下，才办起了这个缝纫厂。建厂的那一年产值只有2.5万元，今年到10月份已完成产值67万元。工人增加到300人，小有规模。我们在山区投下的这颗种子，实践证明了它的生命力。
    厂房就在营区，工人像士兵一样地生活，团结而紧张，活泼而有秩序。橡胶厂的潘副厂长让我们看工人放自行车的棚子，几百辆自行车排成两行，潘副厂长问我们：“像不像两排列队立正的士兵？”“像，真像。”几个人同时回答。朱政委说，来这里上班的，也有些是当地吃商品粮的干部子女，他们说：把孩子送到这里，放心。
    拒马河上的桥不少，但是这次搭起从城市到农村、工业到农业之“桥”的，是当地的驻军。
