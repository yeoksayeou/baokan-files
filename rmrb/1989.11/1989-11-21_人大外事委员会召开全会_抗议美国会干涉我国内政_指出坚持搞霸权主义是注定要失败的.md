Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 20th.

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee held a full meeting this morning in the Great Hall of the People. The meeting passed a statement strongly condemning and protesting the U.S. Congress's passage of an amendment to impose sanctions on China.

The meeting was chaired by Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Liao Hansheng.

Committee members, in their speeches, pointed out that the U.S. Congress, disregarding the facts of the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, and ignoring the basic norms of international relations, passed an amendment to impose sanctions on China, exerting pressure on China and blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs. This is a typical act of hegemonism, which cannot but arouse the great indignation and strong protest of the Chinese people.

The committee members pointed out that the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing was a decisive measure taken by the Chinese government in accordance with the Constitution and laws of China. No foreign country has the right to interfere. Some members of the U.S. Congress are accustomed to using the banner of "freedom" and "human rights" to infringe upon the freedom and rights of the people of other countries. Their actions will only isolate themselves and, in the end, harm themselves. The Chinese government and people have always cherished their independence, sovereignty, and dignity. We do not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and will never allow any foreign government, parliament, or organization to interfere in China's internal affairs.

The committee members pointed out that the friendly relations between China and the United States have been hard-won and are the result of the long-term joint efforts of the governments and peoples of the two countries. It meets the common aspirations of the peoples of the two countries and is conducive to world peace and stability. The current difficulties in Sino-U.S. relations are entirely the result of U.S. actions. The amendment to impose sanctions on China passed by the U.S. Congress this time is another escalation of actions to worsen relations between the two countries. The committee members advise certain members of the U.S. Congress to be more rational and have a broader vision. In today's world, if one insists on practicing power politics and hegemonism, it is doomed to fail.

Committee members who spoke at the meeting included Fu Hao, Zhang Ting, Qu Tangliang, Zeng Tao, Song Yiping, Yao Guang, and Ma Qibin.

　　人大外事委员会召开全会
　　抗议美国会干涉我国内政
　　指出坚持搞霸权主义是注定要失败的
    新华社北京11月20日电　（记者陈雁）全国人大外事委员会今天上午在人民大会堂召开全体会议。会议通过一项声明，对美国国会通过制裁中国的修正案表示强烈的谴责和抗议。
    全国人大常委会副委员长兼外事委员会主任委员廖汉生主持了今天的会议。
    委员们在发言中指出，最近美国国会不顾北京平息反革命暴乱的事实真相，无视国际关系的基本准则，通过对中国实行制裁的修正案，对中国施加压力，粗暴地干涉中国的内政。这是地地道道的霸权主义的行径，不能不引起中国人民的极大愤慨和强烈的抗议。
    委员们指出，北京平息反革命暴乱，是中国政府依据中国宪法和法律采取的果断措施，任何外国都无权干涉。美国国会一些人士惯于打着“自由”和“人权”的旗号，去侵犯别的国家人民的自由和权利。他们这种作法，只能使自己孤立，到头来还会损害自己。中国政府和中国人民一贯珍视自己的独立、主权和尊严，我们从不干涉别国内政，也绝不允许任何外国政府、议会或组织干涉中国内政。
    委员们指出，中美两国友好关系发展到今天，是来之不易的，是两国政府和人民长期共同努力的成果。它符合两国人民的共同愿望，有利于世界和平与稳定。目前中美关系面临的困难，完全是由美国一手造成的。这次美国国会通过的制裁中国的修正案，是进一步恶化两国关系行动的又一次升级。委员们奉劝美国国会的某些议员头脑要冷静一些，视野要开阔一些，在今日的世界，如果还要坚持搞强权政治和霸权主义的那一套，是注定要失败的。
    在今天会议上发言的委员有符浩、张挺、区棠亮、曾涛、宋一平、姚广、马齐彬等。
