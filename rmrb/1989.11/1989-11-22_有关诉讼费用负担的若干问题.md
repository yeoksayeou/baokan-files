Several Questions Regarding the Burden of Litigation Costs

Q: Are the case acceptance fees charged by the people's court, after the case is concluded, always borne by the losing party?

A: After the people's court concludes civil, economic, maritime, and administrative cases, the case acceptance fees are borne by the losing party. If the judgment holds both parties responsible, the acceptance fees are shared by both parties. For joint litigants who lose the case, the people's court will determine the amount each party should bear based on their respective interests in the litigation subject. If there are any expenses incurred for actions taken solely for one's own benefit, that party will bear those costs. Other litigation expenses in the case will be decided by the people's court based on the specific circumstances, determining the amount each party should bear.

Q: How are the litigation costs handled in cases where the second-instance court reverses or dismisses the appeal?

A: If the second-instance court reverses the first-instance court's judgment, it should not only determine the parties' burden of the second-instance litigation costs but also correspondingly modify the first-instance court's decision on the burden of litigation costs. If the second-instance court dismisses the appeal, the case acceptance fee for the appeal is borne by the appellant; if both parties appeal, they share the appeal case acceptance fee.

Q: How are the litigation costs handled in cases where a settlement is reached through mediation?

A: In cases where a settlement is reached through mediation, the litigation costs are resolved through negotiation between the parties; if negotiations fail, the people's court decides. If the second-instance court mediates and reaches a settlement in an appeal case, the burden of all litigation costs for the first and second instances is resolved through negotiation between the parties; if negotiations fail, the second-instance people's court decides.

Q: In some divorce cases, the plaintiff wins, but the litigation costs are borne by the plaintiff. Why is this?

A: The burden of litigation costs in divorce cases is decided by the people's court, which is a principle. Divorce cases differ from other cases. The losing party in a divorce case is not necessarily the one responsible for the dispute, and the winning party is not necessarily without fault in the divorce. Therefore, the people's court decides the burden of litigation costs in divorce cases based on specific circumstances, which can be borne by either the plaintiff or the defendant, or shared by both parties.

Q: How are the case acceptance fees handled in cases where the lawsuit is withdrawn or dismissed?

A: In cases where the lawsuit is withdrawn, the case acceptance fee is borne by the plaintiff, with a 50% reduction; other litigation costs are collected based on actual expenses. In cases where the lawsuit is dismissed, the case acceptance fee is borne by the plaintiff.

Q: Who bears the costs of applying for enforcement and applying for litigation preservation?

A: The application for enforcement fees and actual expenses incurred during enforcement are borne by the respondent. The application fees for litigation preservation measures, as well as the fees for applying to detain ships, retain goods, and fuel in maritime and commercial cases, are borne by the losing party. The application fees for limiting the liability of the shipowner are borne by the applicant.

Q: How are the costs incurred due to improper litigation behavior handled?

A: The party responsible for the improper litigation behavior bears the costs.

Q: How are the case acceptance fees handled in cases involving the recovery of alimony, support, child support, bereavement benefits, and labor remuneration?

A: In such cases, the plaintiff does not need to prepay the case acceptance fee when filing the lawsuit; after the case is concluded, the acceptance fee is borne by the losing party.

Q: How should the people's court handle cases where the party has difficulty paying the case acceptance fee?

A: If a party has difficulty paying the case acceptance fee, if it is a temporary difficulty, they can defer payment; if they cannot pay the full amount, they can pay a reduced amount; for a very small number of parties who cannot pay at all, they can be exempted from payment. Whether to defer, reduce, or exempt payment, the party can apply to the people's court, which will ultimately decide after review.

Q: Which cases are exempt from paying the case acceptance fee?

A: There are mainly two types: one type is cases handled under the special procedures specified in the Civil Procedure Law (trial), such as voter list cases, declaration of missing or death cases, declaration of a citizen's incapacity to act, and declaration of property ownerlessness cases; the second type is cases handled under the judicial supervision procedure for retrial or rehearing.

Q: How are litigation costs handled if too much or too little is paid?

A: When a party prepays litigation costs to the people's court, the court should issue a receipt. After the case is concluded, the people's court should provide a detailed statement of the litigation costs and the amount each party should bear, notifying the parties in writing. The judgment, ruling, or mediation document should also specify the litigation costs each party should bear. The parties can settle the accounts with the people's court using the aforementioned legal documents and payment receipts, with excess amounts refunded and deficiencies supplemented.

Q: If a party disagrees with the people's court's decision on litigation costs, can they appeal this decision separately?

A: If a party disagrees with the people's court's decision on the calculation of litigation costs, they can request the court to review it. If there is indeed an error in the calculation, the people's court should issue a ruling to correct it. Since the people's court's decision on litigation costs is a state action, parties cannot appeal this decision separately.

　　有关诉讼费用负担的若干问题
    问：人民法院的案件受理费，在案件审结后，是否都由败诉的一方负担？
    答：人民法院审结后的民事、经济、海事和行政案件，案件受理费由败诉的当事人负担。判决双方都有责任的，受理费由双方分别负担。共同诉讼当事人败诉，由人民法院根据他们各自对诉讼标的的利害关系，决定各自应负担案件受理费的多少。其中如有专为自己利益的诉讼行为所支出的费用，由该当事人负担。在一案中的其他诉讼费用，由人民法院根据具体情况，决定当事人双方应负担的金额。
    问：第二审法院改判或驳回上诉的案件，诉讼费如何负担？
    答：第二审法院对第一审法院的判决作了改判的，除应当确定当事人对第二审诉讼费用的负担外，还应相应地变更第一审法院对诉讼费用负担的决定。第二审法院驳回上诉的案件，上诉的案件受理费由上诉人负担；双方都提出上诉的，双方分担上诉案件受理费。
    问：调解达成协议的案件，诉讼费用怎样负担？
    答：调解达成协议的案件，诉讼费用由双方协商解决；协商不成的，由人民法院决定。第二审法院审理上诉案件，经调解达成协议的，一审和二审全部诉讼费用的负担，由双方协商解决；协商不成的，由二审人民法院决定。
    问：有些离婚案件，原告胜诉，诉讼费用反由原告负担，是怎么回事？
    答：离婚案件诉讼费用的负担，由人民法院决定，这是一个原则。因离婚案件与其他案件不同。离婚案件败诉的一方不一定是造成纠纷的责任者，胜诉的一方不一定对离婚没有责任。因此，离婚案件的诉讼费用由人民法院根据具体情况决定，可以由原告或者被告一方负担，也可以由双方负担。
    问：撤诉和驳回起诉的案件，案件受理费如何处理？
    答：撤诉的案件，案件受理费由原告负担，减半收取；其他诉讼费用按实际支出收取。驳回起诉的案件，案件受理费由起诉的当事人负担。
    问：申请执行和申请诉讼保全的费用由谁负担？
    答：申请执行费和执行中实际支出的费用，由被申请人负担。申请诉讼保全措施的申请费和海事、海商案件中的申请扣押船舶、申请留置货物、燃料的申请费，由败诉方负担。申请船东责任限制的申请费，由申请人负担。
    问：由于不正当的诉讼行为所支出的费用如何负担？
    答：由不正当诉讼行为的当事人负担。
    问：追索赡养费、扶养费、抚育费、抚恤金和劳动报酬的案件，受理费如何负担？
    答：此类案件原告在起诉时可不预交案件受理费；案件审结后，受理费由败诉方负担。
    问：当事人交纳案件受理费确有困难的如何对待？
    答：当事人交纳案件受理费确有困难的，属于暂时有困难的，可以缓交；全部交纳有困难的，可以减交；极少数当事人根本交不起的，可以免交。是否缓、减、免，当事人可以向人民法院申请，最后由人民法院审查决定。
    问：哪些案件可以不交纳案件受理费？
    答：主要有这样两类：一类是依照民事诉讼法（试行）规定的特别程序审理的案件，如选民名单案件、宣告失踪人死亡案件、认定公民无行为能力案件、认定财产无主案件等；第二类是依照审判监督程序进行提审、再审的案件。
    问：诉讼费用交多了或者交少了如何处理？
    答：当事人向人民法院预交诉讼费用时，人民法院应当开具收据。案件审结后，人民法院应将诉讼费用的详细清单和当事人应负担的数额，用书面通知本人，同时在判决书、裁定书或者调解书中，写明当事人应负担的诉讼费用。当事人凭上述法律文书和交款收据，向人民法院结算，多退少补。
    问：当事人对人民法院决定的诉讼费用有异议，可否就此单独提出上诉？
    答：当事人对人民法院决定的诉讼费用计算有异议，可请求人民法院复核。如计算上确有错误，人民法院应当用裁定更
  正。
    当事人向人民法院进行诉讼，按规定交纳诉讼费用，是法律规定的，人民法院行使的是国家行为，因此当事人不得单独
  就此决定提出上诉。
      问：外国人在中国法院进行诉讼，是否交纳诉讼费用？
      答：外国人、无国籍人、外国企业和组织在人民法院进行
  诉讼，同我国公民、法人一样，都必须交纳诉讼费用。但外国
  法院对我国公民、企业和组织的诉讼费用负担，与其本国公
  民、企业、组织不同对待的，人民法院按对等原则处理。
