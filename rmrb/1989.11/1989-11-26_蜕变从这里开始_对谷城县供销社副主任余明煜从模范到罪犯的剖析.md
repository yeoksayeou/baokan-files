On September 3, 1989, Yu Mingyu, the first deputy director of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Gu Cheng County in Hubei Province, who had been repeatedly awarded as a provincial, municipal, and county labor model, surrendered to the procuratorial authorities after the announcement by the "Two Highs and One Department."

The news spread like wildfire throughout the county, and those who knew him couldn't believe their ears. However, the facts were cruel. Regardless of whether people believed it or not, Yu Mingyu, from October 1986 to July 1989, used his authority to engage in speculation and bribery, receiving a total of 30,118.78 yuan.

Of course, people's doubts were understandable because Yu Mingyu indeed had a glorious history:

In 1955, Yu Mingyu started working at the age of 18. This son of a poor peasant joined the workforce with a heart full of gratitude towards the Party. He was deeply grateful to the Party and always wanted to do more to repay its kindness.

In 1957, he was transferred to the Shihua Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Baiguo Distribution Store. At that time, the store had only two employees, and the conditions were extremely harsh. The two of them started from scratch in this difficult environment. Without shelves, they used cardboard boxes and sticks from the firewood pile to make shelves; without a stove, they ate at other units; without beds, they slept on the cold three-foot counter at night. They insisted on opening early and closing late; they did not close on holidays and festivals, and delivered goods to the doorstep when needed; with a shoulder pole and two baskets, they traversed mountains and valleys to deliver goods to the countryside, ensuring the production and living needs of more than 4,000 farmers in the surrounding five villages.

On May 1, 1965, a nearby farmer was burned and needed a blood transfusion urgently. The young and vigorous Yu Mingyu immediately rushed to the hospital to donate blood. The next day, he suddenly remembered that several farmers urgently needed a few pitchforks, so despite his weakness, he picked up more than a hundred pounds of agricultural supplies and went to the countryside. He was thinking of the villagers! While crossing a mountain ridge, he fainted. When the mountain wind woke him up, he struggled to get up, picked up the pole, and continued on his way until he delivered these items one by one to the farmers. The villagers all called him the "villagers' confidant."

In the winter of 1972, Yu Mingyu, who had become the person in charge of the Baiguo Distribution Store, led everyone to build a tea garden for Hongmasi Village. At that time, it was snowing heavily, and Yu Mingyu, wearing straw shoes and a raincoat, braved the flying snowflakes to clear the mountain and dig pits, and managed to build the tea garden in one winter. As time passed, the economic conditions of the Baiguo Distribution Store improved. Yu Mingyu still insisted on hard work and thrift, not allowing even a piece of white paper or a rope to be wasted. To save expenses, when building a warehouse, Yu Mingyu mobilized everyone to do voluntary labor, except for masonry and carpentry, which were done by hired workers, all other work was done by themselves.

Because the Baiguo Distribution Store insisted on supporting farmers with heart and creating businesses from scratch, the Hubei Provincial Commercial Department issued a call to learn from Baiguo throughout the province. From then on, Yu Mingyu, along with Baiguo, became famous throughout the province. He was repeatedly awarded as a provincial, municipal, and county labor model and proudly joined the Communist Party of China. It seemed that the path before Yu Mingyu was bathed in sunlight and covered with flowers, but he could not walk on this path of light. Instead, he took one step after another towards the abyss.

When he first took up his leadership position, Yu Mingyu was still diligent and conscientious. He was in charge of business and took the lead in "rectifying the purchasing and selling points," and the whole city held a conference here; he took the lead in "revolutionizing the warehousing," and more than 10 counties and cities in the province came here to visit. In the past, Yu Mingyu would have been pleased and proud of this. However, the times had changed. Under the influence of the "everything for money" trend, Yu Mingyu's heart began to tilt. When he saw that the purchasing staff in the subordinate companies earned large bonuses after running around a few times, he began to feel unfair: he worked day and night, but only got a hundred or so yuan in bonuses a year, which was really not worth it. He then tried every means to compensate for this. This labor model, who was previously unmoved by money and did not touch public property, began to accept gifts from others with a clear conscience. "This is the money for my hard work, and I should enjoy it," he sought psychological balance for himself in this way.

With the promotion of his position, Yu Mingyu was no longer satisfied with others' gifts. He held power in his hands! As someone who was about to retire, shouldn't he seize the opportunity to make some money? In the autumn of 1986, Yu Mingyu found the director of the Miaotan Supply and Marketing Cooperative and said that due to business relations, he needed to give a gift to a certain unit, requiring 500 yuan in cash, and asked the Miaotan Supply and Marketing Cooperative to pay for it. This director immediately gave Yu Mingyu 500 yuan. After receiving the money, Yu Mingyu did not give it to anyone as a gift but put it into his own pocket and kept it for himself. This was Yu Mingyu's first act of extortion. After putting the money in his pocket, he dared not spend it, and his heart was indeed a bit frightened, always worried that the matter would be exposed. After all, this was not money obtained by proper means! After thinking it over, he went to the county supply and marketing car team to have someone issue a fake transportation voucher for 500 yuan and handed it to the Miaotan Supply and Marketing Cooperative for reimbursement, only then did he put his mind at ease.

Everything is difficult at the beginning. After this first trembling attempt, Yu Mingyu's courage grew. On February 14, 1988, Yu Mingyu, in the name of his hometown Yu Dian Village, purchased 30 tons of urea at 600 yuan per ton from the county production materials company, but sold it to the Dayajiao Supply and Marketing Cooperative at 850 yuan per ton, making a profit of 7,500 yuan in one go.

In November of the same year, Yu Mingyu again extorted from the deputy director of the Dayajiao Supply and Marketing Cooperative. He said, "My brother-in-law is hospitalized in Wuhan and spent tens of thousands of yuan. I will give you 20 tons of subsidized urea, and after selling it, you can give me some of the price difference." This deputy director agreed happily. Yu Mingyu purchased 20 tons of urea at 507 yuan per ton for the Dayajiao Supply and Marketing Cooperative, but the cooperative sold it at a high price of 1,020 yuan per ton. On the evening of December 25, this deputy director brought 8,000 yuan in cash to Yu Mingyu, who immediately returned 2,000 yuan to the deputy director, keeping 6,000 yuan in cash for himself....

One success after another, Yu Mingyu became insatiable. He lent the stolen money to Yu Dian Village in the name of a bank loan and charged interest of 360 yuan; he also invested 9,931 yuan in the county's waste materials recycling company and received dividends of 752.52 yuan. In this way, in more than three years, Yu Mingyu accumulated a total of 30,118.78 yuan in stolen money, finally falling from a model worker to a criminal.

Yu Mingyu said, "The fundamental reason for my crime is that I relaxed my worldview transformation and abandoned the fine traditions and styles of hard work and struggle."

He became a model worker through hard work, and his original intention was to repay the Party's kindness. As time passed, this simple feeling would gradually fade away, and he also did not like to study, so how could he withstand the impact of the bourgeois liberalization trend in the reform and opening-up situation?

For example, at a meeting of all the cooperative's employees, he publicly said, "Now, aren't we using the standard of productivity to measure cadres? What is the standard of productivity? It's money." When some cadres advised him not to focus only on money and also to do some ideological and political work, he retorted, "What is ideological and political work? No one can explain it now. This work, that work, in the end, you have to eat."

Because of these wrong thoughts, Yu Mingyu was no longer as thrifty and hardworking as before, nor was he as selfless and hardworking as before; instead, he began to calculate personal gains and losses, which developed into speculation and bribery, falling into the trap of money, and ultimately taking the path of crime.

　　蜕变从这里开始
　　——对谷城县供销社副主任余明煜从模范到罪犯的剖析
　　李国文　杨龙
    1989年9月3日，多次被评为省、市、县劳动模范的湖北省谷城县供销社第一副主任余明煜，在“两高一部”通告后，向检察机关投案自首了。
    消息像长了翅膀，很快在全县传开，熟悉他的人都不敢相信自己的耳朵。可事实是无情的。不管人们相信与否，余明煜从1986年10月到1989年7月间，利用权利投机倒把、收受贿赂30118.78元。
    当然，人们的怀疑也自有道理，因为余明煜确确实实有着一段光荣历史：
    1955年余明煜参加工作时年仅18岁。这位贫农的儿子是怀着对党满腔的感激之情走上工作岗位的。他从心眼里感激党，总想多干点事来报答党的恩情。
    1957年，他被调到石花供销社白果分销店工作。当时店里只有两名职工，条件极为艰苦，他俩就在这艰苦的环境里白手起家。没有货架，他们就用包装箱板子和柴禾堆里的棍子钉起来做成；没有锅灶，他们就在别的单位搭伙吃饭；没有床铺，晚上就睡在冰凉的三尺柜台上。他们坚持早开门，晚关门；节日假日不关门，群众需要送上门；凭着一条扁担两只箩筐，翻山越岭送货下乡，保证了附近5个村4000多农民的生产和生活需要。
    1965年5月的一天，附近一位农民被火烧伤了，急需输血。年轻气盛的余明煜立即跑到医院献了血。第二天，他忽然想起有几户农民急需几支钉耙，不顾身体虚弱，挑起百十斤重的农用物资又下乡了。他心里惦记着村民们啊！在翻过一道山梁时，他晕倒了。当山风把他吹醒后，他挣扎着爬了起来，挑起担子又赶路，直到把这些东西一件件都送到农民手里。村民们都称他是“农民的贴心人”。
    1972年冬，已经成为白果分销店负责人的余明煜带领大家为红马庙村建茶园。当时正下着大雪，余明煜脚穿草鞋，身披蓑衣，顶着纷飞的雪花开山挖窝，硬是在一个冬天里把茶场建了起来。随着时间的推移，白果分销店的经济条件好了。余明煜仍然要求大家艰苦奋斗、勤俭办事，连一张白纸、一根麻绳也不许浪费。为节省开支，店里建库房，余明煜动员大家搞义务劳动，除了砌工、木工是请师傅外，其余的活都自己包了。
    由于白果分销店坚持贴心支农，艰苦创业，湖北省商业厅向全省发出“学白果”的号召，从此，余明煜也同白果一起闻名全省。他多次被评为省、市、县劳动模范，光荣地加入了中国共产党。按说，摆在余明煜面前的路是洒满阳光、铺满鲜花的，然而，他却没能够沿着这条光明之路走下去，而是一步一步地走向深渊。
    刚走上领导岗位时，余明煜还是兢兢业业的。他分管业务，抓了“整顿代购代销点”，全市在这里召开现场会；抓了“仓储革命化”，全省10多个县、市来这里参观。要是在过去，余明煜会为此而感到欣慰，感到自豪。然而，时代不同了，在“一切向钱看”思潮的影响下，余明煜心中的天平出现了倾斜。当看着下属公司里的一些采购员出去跑几圈，就大把大把的奖金往回领，他开始感到不公平了：自己白天黑夜辛苦，
  一年才100多块钱的奖金，真不合算。他便想方设法进行补偿。这位原来在金钱面前毫不动心、对公共财物秋毫不沾的劳动模范也开始心安理得地接受别人送来的礼物了。“这是自己的辛苦钱，应该享受。”——他这样为自己寻求心理平衡。
    随着地位的升迁，余明煜已不再满足于别人的施舍，自己手中捏着权呢！已是快退休的人了，还不抓紧捞一把？1986年秋，余明煜找到庙滩供销社的一位主任，说由于业务关系，要给某单位送礼，需要现金500元，请庙滩供销社支付。这位副主任当即就给了余明煜500元。余明煜接过钱后并没给谁送礼，而是把钱装进了自己的腰包，据为己有。
    这就是余明煜索贿的第一次。钱装进腰包后，他一直不敢花，心里确实有些后怕，整天担心事情败露。这毕竟不是正道上来的钱呵！思来想去，他又在县供销车队找人开了一张500元的假运货单据，交给庙滩供销社列支，这才放下心。
    万事开头难。有了这颤颤惊惊的第一次后，余明煜的胆子越来越大。1988年2月14日，余明煜以老家余店村的名义，在县生产资料公司以每吨600元的价格购得尿素30吨，却以每吨850元的价格倒卖给大峪桥供销社，一次就牟利7500元。
    同年11月，余明煜又向大峪桥供销社副主任索要。他说：“我妹夫在武汉住院，花了万把块钱，我给你们批20吨平价尿素，销售后给我搞一点差价款。”这位副主任欣然同意。余明煜以每吨507元为大峪桥供销社购得尿素20吨，该社却以每吨1020元的高价倒卖出去。12月25日的晚上，那位副主任给余明煜送来8000元现金，余当即回给副主任2000元，自己实得现金6000元。……
    一次次得手，余明煜已到了贪得无厌的地步。他将赃款以银行贷款的名义借给余店村，放起了高利贷，收利息360元；还将9931元在县废旧物资回收公司入股，分得股息752.52元。就这样，在3年多里，余明煜共获赃款30118.78元，终于从一名模范堕落成罪犯。
    余明煜为什么堕落？他自己说：“我之所以犯罪，根本问题是放松世界观改造，丢掉了艰苦奋斗的优良传统和作风。”
    他当劳模靠的是艰苦奋斗，其初衷是为了报答党的恩情。随着岁月的流逝，朴素的感情必将渐渐淡漠，加上他平时又不爱学习，在改革、开放的形势下，哪里经受得住资产阶级自由化思潮的冲击？
    例如，在一次全社职工会上，他公然说：“现在不是用生产力标准衡量干部吗？生产力标准是什么？就是钱。”当有些干部劝他别把眼睛只盯在钱上，也得抓抓思想政治工作时，他反问道：“什么思想政治工作？现在谁也说不清。这工作，那工作，最后总得要吃饭。”
    由于这些错误思想作怪，余明煜再也不像过去那样勤俭节约，艰苦朴素了，再也不像过去那样不计个人得失，埋头苦干了；而是开始斤斤计较，进而发展为投机倒把，贪污受贿，钻进了钱眼儿，最终走上犯罪道路。
