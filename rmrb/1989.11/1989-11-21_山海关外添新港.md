On October 23rd, a new port was completed in the Bohai Bay outside the Shanhaiguan Pass, at the foot of the Penjiazhuang Mountain. This is the Jinzhou Port in Liaoning Province. When the "Hongqi" 173, a ship from the Guangzhou Maritime Bureau, set sail loaded with corn from the northern regions towards Shenzhen's Shekou Port, three long blasts of the ship's horn solemnly declared: the history of Jinxi Region having no commercial port has come to an end.

Jinzhou City, the throat of the Liaoxi Corridor, is a crucial link between inside and outside the Shanhaiguan Pass and has been a strategic location for military control throughout history. Although Jinzhou City has developed rail and road transportation, it is far from meeting the needs of industrial and agricultural production in Liaoxi and the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, as well as the western parts of Jilin and Heilongjiang. According to statistics from relevant departments, in 1983, Jinzhou Region had 100 million tons of grain that could not be transported out, resulting in losses. The two major refineries in Jinzhou and Jinxi have an annual crude oil processing capacity of 7.5 million tons, but due to insufficient transportation capacity, only 5.49 million tons were processed in 1984. In recent years, the development of offshore oil and gas fields in this region has urgently required the two refineries to increase their production capacity. However, the "intestinal obstruction" problem remains unsolved!

The Jinzhou Municipal Party Committee and the People's Government have long identified this difficulty and confirmed that the solution lies in facing the sea. They decisively decided to use local fiscal funds and raise funds from the masses to build the Jinzhou Port. The first phase of the project has a total investment of 162 million yuan, aiming to build one 5,000-ton product oil berth and one general cargo berth, with a throughput capacity of 15.8 million tons. Since the groundbreaking on October 31, 1986, after three years of hard work, half of the nearby Mantou Mountain has been levelled. They also mobilized local farmers to quarry stones, throwing 455,000 cubic meters of large stones into the sea to build the breakwater. By the time the cargo wharf was open to navigation, 3,137 meters of breakwater had been built, which is currently the longest in the country.

The newly opened Jinzhou Port is like a giant magnet, attracting cities and entrepreneurs from the hinterland. They are eager to set up stations and warehouses within the port. As of now, on the northern slope of Mantou Mountain by the coast, the cargo wharf has been completed, and the oil wharf project is rapidly advancing. The pipelines for the spherical and columnar oil storage tanks of the refinery are already in place...

Facing the newly established Jinzhou Port Economic Zone, Mayor Hu Zhan Shan and Secretary Sha Bing Ren of Jinzhou enthusiastically told us: As an open city, building such a new port will directly facilitate domestic and international exchanges of materials and technology, continuously attract foreign investment, revitalize Jinzhou, develop Liaoxi, and better serve the entire Northeast. The people of Jinzhou have the courage to shoulder this heavy responsibility.

### 山海关外添新港

　　山海关外添新港
    10月23日，山海关外的渤海湾内笔架山下，建成一座新的海港，这就是辽宁省锦州港。当一艘广州海运局的“红旗”173号轮船满载着北国的玉米起锚驶向祖国南疆深圳市蛇口港时，三声汽笛长鸣庄严宣告：辽西地区无商港的历史已经结束了。
    锦州市，辽西走廊的咽喉，是连接山海关内外的枢纽，也是历代兵家必争之地。尽管锦州市铁路和公路运输发达，但远远不能满足辽西工农业生产和内蒙古东部、吉林、黑龙江西部地区生产发展的需要。据有关部门统计：1983年时，锦州地区有100万吨粮食不能外运而蒙受了损失。锦州和锦西的两大炼油厂年加工原油能力为750万吨，也是因为运力不足，1984年只加工了549万吨。近年来，这一地区海域上大陆架油气田的开发，又迫切要求两大炼油厂增加生产能力，但是“肠梗阻”的难题无法解决啊！
    锦州市委和市人民政府早已看准了这一难点，并确认出路只能面向大海。他们果断决定动用本地财政资金和向群众集资并举修建锦州海港。第一期工程总投资1.62亿元，拟建设5000吨成品油泊位和通用件杂货泊位各一个，吞吐量为158万吨。从1986年10月31日破土动工起，历经三载，艰辛奋斗，附近的馒头山已被削掉一半。他们又动员附近农民开山采石，将45.5万立方米大石头投向大海修引堤。到杂货码头通航时间为止，已修引堤3137米，这是目前国内最长的引堤。
    锦州港刚刚通航。它像块巨大的磁石，吸引着腹地的一些城市和企业家们。他们纷纷要求到港内建站建库。截至目前，在海岸边的馒头山北麓，杂货码头建成了，油码头工程也在急起直追，炼油厂的球型贮油罐和柱型贮油罐的管线已经就位……
    面对新辟为经济特区的锦州港区，锦州市长胡占山和市委书记邵秉仁兴奋地告诉我们：锦州作为开放城市，建设这么一个新港，直接与国内外进行物资与技术交流，不断吸引外资，振兴锦州，开发辽西，可以更好地服务全东北。锦州人民有勇气挑起这副重担。
