Prime Minister Shrestha and his wife hosted a grand banquet at the Prime Minister's residence to welcome Chinese Premier Li Peng and his wife, Zhu Lin, who arrived this morning for an official friendly visit.

The banquet hall was brightly lit. The walls were adorned with the national flags of both China and Nepal. Candles were lit on the dining tables. Both the Nepalese Prime Minister and the Chinese Premier gave speeches at the banquet, expressing their commitment to further strengthening the friendly cooperative relationship between China and Nepal.

Prime Minister Shrestha praised the friendship between Nepal and China in his speech. He said that the excellent state of Nepal-China friendship is the result of the joint efforts of both countries. The contributions of King Mahendra, the late Chairman Mao Zedong, and Premier Zhou Enlai to the development and consolidation of Nepal-China friendship are beyond words. King Birendra's multiple visits to China, especially his official visit in 1987, further strengthened the friendly cooperative relationship between the two countries. Visits by Chinese leaders to Nepal have also made similar contributions to this friendship. The visit of Chinese senior leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978, as well as the visits by Chinese chairmen, premiers, and other Chinese dignitaries, are all significant events in the history of Nepal-China relations. He said that the Nepalese government and people regard Premier Li Peng's visit as a timely expression of friendship and unity and as a new milestone in Nepal-China relations.

He praised China's construction achievements and Nepal-China cooperation. He said that Nepal admires the determination and dedication shown by the Chinese government and people in modernizing the country and improving the people's living standards.

He expressed Nepal's sincere gratitude to China for its generous donation to build the Nepal International Conference Hall. He said that tomorrow, Li Peng will lay the foundation stone for the hall, which will be the best symbol of his visit to Nepal.

He said that Nepal is satisfied with the progress made in promoting bilateral trade, developing tourism, joint ventures, and technological cooperation between the two countries and reaffirmed the Nepalese King's government's willingness to continuously expand and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation between Nepal and China.

In discussing the domestic situation in Nepal, he said that in the past eight months, Nepal has faced some difficulties that have had a negative impact on the economy and made environmental problems more severe. However, Nepal has the hope of finding an acceptable solution through self-reliant effective measures and through implementing a friendly dialogue policy consistent with the United Nations Charter, non-alignment, and peaceful coexistence, which is open at any time.

He said that the United Nations Charter, peaceful coexistence, and non-alignment, as well as equality and friendship with all countries, especially with neighboring countries, are the two pillars of Nepal's foreign policy. Nepal believes that as long as these basic principles of inter-state relations are followed, the peace, harmony, and cooperation of the world are guaranteed. Weakening the principles of equality, sovereignty, and non-interference between countries is equivalent to spreading the germs of discord and strife.

He said that the international trend is moving towards increasing mutual understanding between countries. Unfortunately, it cannot be said that this favorable trend has fully and deeply penetrated all parts of the world. The goal of Nepal's foreign policy is to declare Nepal a peace zone.

Shrestha said that Nepal appreciates China's role in international affairs and highly values and thanks China for its support for Nepal's peace zone proposal.

In his speech, Li Peng praised Nepal's achievements. He said, "In recent years, the Nepalese government and people have implemented the policy of self-reliance in developing the national economy and meeting the basic needs of the people as proposed by King Birendra, and have achieved gratifying results in the construction of their own country. The Nepalese government pursues an independent and non-aligned foreign policy, adheres to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and in international affairs, upholds justice, opposes hegemony and aggression, advocates peace, disarmament, and development, and has made valuable contributions to strengthening the unity of Third World countries, maintaining peace and stability in South Asia, and promoting South Asian regional cooperation. King Birendra's proposal to declare Nepal a peace zone has received increasing support from more and more countries in the world, making an active contribution to maintaining peace in the region."

Li Peng said, "China and Nepal are close neighbors connected by mountains and rivers. The majestic Himalayas tightly connect our two countries. For thousands of years, we have maintained a deep traditional friendship. The establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries marked the beginning of a new stage in our relations. The seeds of Nepal-China friendship sown by the late King Mahendra, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Premier Zhou Enlai have taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit among the peoples of the two countries. The Nepal-China friendly neighborly relations established on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are a model for the development of inter-state relations today."

He said that King Birendra's multiple friendly visits to China have made important contributions to promoting Nepal-China friendship and the development of relations between the two countries. He firmly believes that through the joint efforts of both sides, the close friendly relations that already exist between China and Nepal will be further consolidated and strengthened.

Li Peng said that Nepal is the last stop on his South Asian tour. A week of visits has made him deeply feel the friendly sentiments of the South Asian people towards the Chinese people. The Chinese people have a long history of traditional friendship with the peoples of South Asian countries. He said, "China has always advocated that countries, regardless of their size or strength, should be treated equally, respect each other, and not interfere in each other's internal affairs. Developing friendly neighborly relations with all South Asian countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence has always been China's unshakable policy."

Li Peng reiterated in his speech that regardless of changes in the international situation, the Chinese government and people will, as always, support Nepal and other South Asian countries in their efforts to maintain independence and sovereignty and develop their national economies; support the proposals and advocacy for the Indian Ocean peace zone, the South Asian nuclear-free zone, and the Nepalese peace zone.

The speeches by Shrestha and Li Peng were met with enthusiastic applause from the audience. As they finished their speeches, the orchestra played the national anthems of both countries.

Nepalese officials attending the banquet included Chief Justice D. Bahadur Singh, Chairman of the National Assembly Subedi, and other cabinet ministers.

Accompanying Li Peng on his visit, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin, and Vice Chairman of the General Staff He Qizong attended the banquet.

　　什雷斯塔首相盛宴欢迎李鹏总理
　　什雷斯塔说李鹏总理访问是尼中关系的又一里程碑
　　李鹏说中尼亲密友好关系将得到进一步巩固和加强
    新华社加德满都11月19日电　（记者陈家保　朱士骧）尼泊尔首相什雷斯塔和夫人今晚在首相府举行盛大宴会，欢迎今天上午到达这里进行正式友好访问的中国总理李鹏和夫人朱琳。
    宴会厅里灯火辉煌。墙上挂着中尼两国国旗。餐桌上点燃着蜡烛。尼泊尔首相和中国总理在宴会上先后讲话，一致表示将进一步加强中尼友好合作关系。
    什雷斯塔首相在讲话中赞扬尼中友谊。他说，尼中友好关系的美好现状是两国共同努力的结果。马亨德拉先王陛下、已故的毛泽东主席和周恩来总理对尼中友谊的发展和巩固的贡献，是任何人也无法用言语形容的。比兰德拉国王陛下多次访华，特别是1987年的正式访问，进一步加强了两国的友好合作关系。中国领导人对尼的访问，也对这种友谊作出同样的贡献。1978年中国高级领导人邓小平访尼，以及中国主席、总理和其他中国要人的历次访问，都是尼中关系史上的大事。他说，尼泊尔政府和人民把李鹏总理的这次访问看成是友谊和团结的及时表示和尼中关系的又一新的里程碑。
    他赞扬中国的建设成就和尼中合作。他说，尼泊尔钦佩中国政府和人民在进行国家现代化和提高人民生活水平方面所表现的决心和献身精神。
    他说，对中国慷慨赠款援建尼国际会议大厦，尼泊尔向中国政府和人民表示最诚挚的感谢。他说，明天，李鹏将为大厦奠基，这将成为他访尼的最好标志。
    他说，尼泊尔对两国在促进双边贸易、发展旅游、合资经营与技术合作方面所取得的进展感到满意，并重申尼泊尔国王陛下政府愿意不断扩大和加深尼中之间的互利合作。
    他在谈到尼国内情况时说，在过去的8个月中，尼面临一些困难，对经济产生不利影响，并使环境问题更为严重。然而，尼通过采取自力更生的有效措施，通过实行与联合国宪章、不结盟和和平共处原则相一致的、任何时候都敞开的友好对话政策，有希望找到一项可以接受的解决办法。
    他说，联合国宪章、和平共处和不结盟以及与各国，尤其是与邻国平等友好，是尼泊尔外交政策的两大基石。尼坚信，只要遵循这些国家间相互关系的基本准则，世界的和平、和睦和合作就有保证。削弱国与国平等、主权和互不干涉的准则，那就等于传播不和与纷争的病菌。
    他说，国际关系的大趋势正朝着增进国家间相互了解的方向发展。然而不幸的是，还不能说这个有利的趋势正全面深入到世界各地。尼外交政策的目标是宣布尼泊尔为和平区。
    什雷斯塔说，尼泊尔赞赏中国在国际事务中的作用，高度评价并感谢中国对尼和平区建议的支持。
    李鹏在讲话中赞扬尼泊尔取得的成就。他说：“近年来，尼泊尔政府和人民贯彻执行比兰德拉国王陛下提出的自力更生发展民族经济和满足人民基本需求的方针，在建设自己国家的事业中取得了可喜的成就。尼泊尔政府奉行独立和不结盟的外交政策，恪守和平共处五项原则，在国际事务中，主持正义，反对强权政治和侵略扩张，主张和平、裁军和发展，并为加强第三世界国家的团结、维护南亚的和平与稳定，推动南亚区域合作作出了可贵的贡献。比兰德拉国王陛下宣布尼泊尔为和平区的建议，得到世界上越来越多的国家的支持，为维护本地区的和平作出了积极贡献。”
    李鹏说：“中国和尼泊尔是山水相连的亲密邻邦，巍峨的喜马拉雅山把我们两国紧密地连接在一起。千百年来我们两国一直保持着深厚的传统友谊。中尼建交标志着两国关系进入了一个新的阶段。已故马亨德拉国王陛下和毛泽东主席、周恩来总理播下的中尼友谊的种子，已经在两国人民中生根、开花、结果。建立在和平共处五项原则基础上的中尼睦邻友好关系堪称当今国与国之间发展相互关系的典范。”
    他说，比兰德拉国王陛下对中国的多次友好访问，为增进中尼友谊和两国关系的发展作出了重要贡献。我深信，经过我们双方的共同努力，中尼两国之间业已存在的亲密友好关系必将得到进一步的巩固和加强。
    李鹏说，尼泊尔是他此次南亚之行的最后一站。一个星期的访问，使他深深感受到南亚人民对中国人民的友好情意。中国人民同南亚各国人民有着悠久的传统友谊。他说：“中国历来主张，国家不分大小、强弱，应该一律平等，互相尊重，互不干涉内部事务。在和平共处五项原则基础上同所有南亚国家发展睦邻友好关系，一直是中国坚定不移的方针。”
    李鹏在讲话中重申，无论国际形势发生什么变化，中国政府和人民将一如既往支持尼泊尔和其它南亚国家为维护独立、主权，发展民族经济所作的努力；支持印度洋和平区、南亚无核区和尼泊尔和平区的建议和主张。
    什雷斯塔和李鹏的讲话博得全场热烈掌声。在他们结束讲话时，乐队奏起两国国歌。
    尼泊尔方面出席宴会的有大法官德·巴哈杜尔·辛格、全国评议会主席苏贝迪以及其他内阁大臣。
    随同李鹏出访的中国外长钱其琛、对外经贸部长郑拓彬和何其宗副总参谋长等出席了宴会。
