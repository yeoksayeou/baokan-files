Title: The Living and the Dead "Compete" for Land

Every time I visit the countryside or rural areas, I notice new graves quietly increasing, and many clusters of tombs appearing. According to estimates from the Civil Affairs Bureau of Xuzhou City, the number of new graves in the city is increasing by over 30,000 each year.

This situation is common across the country. Every year, over a million mu (approximately 166,667 acres) of land that could be used by the living is taken up to build graves for the dead.

Taking Xuzhou City as an example, in the past year, 35,280 people died, but only 17,035 were cremated, with a cremation rate of 48.28%. It is worth noting that even after cremation, people still insist on traditional burial. From the early days of liberation until last year, only about 2,500 urns of ashes were stored in columbaria, and these are mostly temporary. After cremation, most ashes are still buried in the ground, often in large coffins containing smaller ones, maintaining the old practice. Currently, China's population is 1.1 billion. In less than a century, these people will also pass away. If traditional burial continues, with each grave occupying about 4 square meters, how much land will 1.1 billion graves occupy? It won't be long before our descendants will find it difficult to live and reproduce on this land.

There are no ghosts in the world; it is not the deceased who are causing trouble, but the living themselves. Thousands of years of traditional burial practices have deeply ingrained this custom. There is a saying, "Where there is yellow earth, there are people buried." Most Chinese people, especially the Han ethnicity, place too much importance on traditional burial. No matter how large or small the family, they must purchase a plot of land (a grave site). The greatest shame for a person seems to be "dying without a place to be buried" and "digging up ancestral graves." If someone becomes an official or gets rich, people will say, "Your family's grave site has good feng shui" or "You have offered incense to your ancestral graves."

Since the 1950s, the people of China's cities and countryside have responded to the government's calls several times to level graves and deeply bury remains, freeing up a large amount of land. However, once management and education are relaxed, old ideas resurface, and many people, based on their impressions, rebuild ancestral graves on farmland and erect new tombstones, even preparing grave sites for themselves and their descendants. Due to limited education and resistance to old ideas, promoting cremation in rural areas is particularly difficult. Taking the counties under Xuzhou's jurisdiction as an example, last year, Feng County had 4,736 deaths, with only 65 cremations; Pizhou had 5,993 deaths, with only 101 cremations; and Pei County had 4,158 deaths, with only 114 cremations. It is understood that some family members agree to cremate the deceased only for the funeral allowance; even after cremation, they still insist on traditional burial.

Countless facts show that traditional funeral practices can be changed. For example, in the past, it was emphasized that "fallen leaves return to their roots, and one cannot leave their native soil." The story of the Eastern Han general Ma Yuan, who fought on the frontier and whose words "Wrap my body in horsehide and bury me in my hometown" were once praised as a timeless tale, but later people negated it: "Every green mountain buries loyal bones; why wrap the body in horsehide to return?" Premier Zhou Enlai's ashes were not buried in a mausoleum but, in accordance with his wishes, scattered into rivers and the earth. In people's minds, his spirit lives on with the country. Another example is Professor Shen Fupeng of Qingdao Medical College, who, after his death, had his body dissected and turned into a specimen for teaching purposes, as per his will. In his own words, "Standing guard with my body again."

Of course, it is unrealistic to expect everyone to possess such high moral standards. However, if people can think more about their descendants and not compete with future generations for living space, choosing to rest in a columbarium after death, or burying ashes in a public cemetery, or deeply burying without leaving a grave mound that interferes with farming or damages scenic spots, it is certainly achievable.

### 土地，死者与生者在“争夺”

    土地，死者与生者在“争夺”
    江苏省徐州市　张成珠
    每每来到郊野、乡间，总发现新的坟茔在悄悄增多，出现许多连片的墓地。据徐州市民政局估测，该市的新坟，逐年在以3万多座的巨量递增。
    这种情况，在全国各地是屡见不鲜的。一年之中，全国要让出100多万亩活人的立足之地，用以为死者营造坟茔。
    仍以徐州市为例，去年一年死亡35280人，其中火化的仅有170350人，火化率占48.28％。值得注意的，即便火化了也照旧土葬。自解放初截至去年统计，骨灰堂收存的骨灰匣，只有2500余具，这些也多属暂寄。火化以后的骨灰，大多依旧用大棺套小棺，入土筑坟，不改陋习。目前我国人口11亿，不消百年，这些人也将辞世。倘若继续实行土葬，每坟占地约4平方米，11亿该占地多少？无须多久，子孙后代必将难以在这块土地上生存、繁衍。
    世上没有鬼魂，作祟的不是亡者，而是活人自己。数千年的土葬习俗，铸成了根深蒂固的传统殡葬观念，俗话就有“哪里黄土不埋人”之说。大多的中国人（尤其是汉族），都把土葬看得太重了。家族不论大小，总得购置林地（墓地），做人的最大羞耻，似乎莫过于“死无葬身之地”和“挖祖坟”。要是有谁升了官、发了财，捧场的人便说“你家林地风水好”，或是“给祖坟敬过高香的缘故”。
    从五十年代起，我国城乡人民曾经几度响应政府号召，平坟深埋遗骨，腾出了大量的土地。可是，一旦管理和教育有所放松，旧观念便沉渣泛起，许多人就凭着印象又在田地上复筑祖坟，重立墓碑，甚至为自己和子孙筹备墓地。由于文化水平的局限和旧思想的抵制，在农村推行火葬尤其艰难。再以徐州的辖县为例，去年一年，丰县死亡4736人，火化的只有65具，邳县死亡5993人，火化的只有101具，沛县死亡4158人，火化的只有114具。据了解，有的家属之所以同意让死者火化，那是看在“钱”的份上，不过是为了领取丧葬费；火化以后，仍要土葬。
    无数事实表明，传统的殡葬观也是可以改变的。比如，以往讲究“落叶归根，故土难离”。东汉名将马援远征边关，他那“马革裹尸，归葬故里”的事迹，虽曾传为千古佳话，但后人终于予以否定：“青山处处埋忠骨，何须马革裹尸还？”周恩来总理的骨灰，没有葬入陵墓，而是遵照他的遗愿，把骨灰撒到江河大地。在人们心目之中，他的英灵与祖国同存。再如，青岛医学院教授沈福彭先生去世，遵照他的遗嘱，由他的学生将尸体解剖，制成标本，以供教学之用。照沈先生自己的话来说，就是“用遗体再站一班岗”。
    当然，苛求芸芸众生都具备如此高风亮节，那是不可能的。不过，只求人们多为子孙着想，不与后人争夺养生之地，待死后安息于骨灰堂，或将骨灰葬入公墓，或深埋不留坟头而无妨耕作，无损名胜景观，还是办得到的。
