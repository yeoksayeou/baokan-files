A group of Ming and Qing ancient buildings, known as the "living fossil of ancient residential architecture" and the most complete ancient residential village in northern China, has been discovered in Pangi Village, Hancheng City, Shaanxi Province. This has attracted the attention of experts both domestically and internationally.

Pangi Village is located 9 kilometers northeast of Hancheng City in a gourd-shaped valley. It is a typical village fortress composed of courtyard-style residences. The earliest preserved buildings in the village were constructed in the 20th year of the Ming Dynasty's Yongle era (1422). The village features 7 ancestral halls, 5 pavilions, 3 towers, and 2 pagodas, all interspersed among the residential buildings.

Experts believe that this ancient architectural group is rich in content and provides valuable physical evidence for the study of architecture, painting, sculpture, and folk customs from the Ming and Qing periods. Since 1987, dozens of experts and professors from Japan, the United States, France, and other countries and regions have visited the site for field studies.

    韩城发现完好的明清古建筑群
    本报西安电　被誉为“古民居建筑的活化石”、迄今我国北方保存最完整的明清古建筑村落——陕西省韩城市党家村，已引起国内外专家的关注。
    党家村位于韩城市东北9公里处的一个葫芦型川道之中，是四合院式民居组成的典型村寨。该村现保存最早的建筑建于明永乐20年（1422年）。村中明、清时兴建的7祠、5坊、3楼、2塔点缀于民居中间。
    专家们认为，这一古建筑群内涵丰富，为研究明、清时期的建筑、绘画、雕刻、民俗等提供了珍贵的实物资料。1987年以来，日本、美国、法国等国家和地区的数十名专家教授，专程赴此地考察。
