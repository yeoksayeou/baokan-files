From January to October this year, the Longyangxia Power Station, located on the upper reaches of the Yellow River, supplied 3.49 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity to Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and other regions. The station completed its annual electricity generation task two months ahead of schedule, exceeding the target by 16.4%.

The Longyangxia Power Station completed its annual production task ahead of schedule despite facing the second-largest flood since the founding of the People's Republic. From June to September, continuous heavy rains in the Yellow River source area up to Longyangxia caused severe flooding. The highest inflow rate reached 4,820 cubic meters per second, and mountain torrents even reached the doorsteps of the power station. The station's more than 300 employees risked their lives daily, climbing up and down a steep, 140-meter-high temporary construction scaffold to transport materials.

    战胜特大洪水袭扰
    龙羊峡电站完成全年任务
    据新华社西宁11月8日电  （记者王春生、通讯员新声）今年1至10月，黄河上游的龙头水电站——龙羊峡电站向陕、甘、青等地输电34.9亿多度，提前两个月超额16.4％完成全年发电任务。
    龙羊峡电站超额完成全年生产任务是在遇到建国以来第二次特大洪水的袭扰中取得的。6至9月，黄河源头到龙羊峡一带大雨连绵，洪水暴发，最高入库流量每秒达4820立方米，山洪也冲到了发电站房门口。电站的300多名职工，每天冒着生命危险从陡峭的高达140多米的临时施工栈道爬上爬下背运物资。
