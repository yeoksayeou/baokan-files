    Domestic Wool Faces Stockpiling
    *Market News* Urges Herdsmen to Spare the Sheep, Calls for Industry, Herdsmen, and Merchants to Work Together to Overcome Difficulties

    Our reporter informs that since the wool procurement season began this year, market order has improved, wool quality is high, and prices have fallen. However, currently, herdsmen are holding onto large quantities of wool that they cannot sell. Some wool-producing areas have analyzed that this winter may see another wave of sheep slaughter. Today's issue of *Market News* quotes relevant individuals, urgently calling out: Please spare the sheep!

    The shift from wool scarcity to stockpiling is thought-provoking. People will not forget the "wool wars" of previous years, which were even more severe last year. Due to the disorderly circulation of wool, its price surged, leading to a sharp increase in the cost of finished products. Wool products also underwent several price hikes, exceeding the affordability of most consumers. In the sluggish market this year, wool products are stagnant, leading to a series of "blockages": market stagnation, product stockpiling; enterprises lack funds for turnover and cannot purchase raw materials; supply and marketing cooperatives still have last year's purchased wool in stock, with no money to procure more; herdsmen have large quantities of wool they cannot sell.

    According to the Ministry of Agriculture, currently, major wool-producing areas such as Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia have herdsmen holding onto large quantities of high-quality, low-priced wool, hoping for buyers. Investigations show that about half of the wool produced in Inner Mongolia is still in the hands of herdsmen, and one-third of the sold wool is paid with IOUs, affecting the herdsmen's enthusiasm for raising sheep, with worrying consequences.

    Over the past decade, China has experienced three instances of wool stockpiling: 32,000 tons in 1979, 43,900 tons in 1984, and 104,000 tons in 1988. The first two instances were followed by waves of sheep slaughter. This time, with wool stockpiling again, *Market News* suggests that relevant departments take joint measures. The industrial, herdsmen, and commercial sectors should work together to overcome difficulties. Commercial departments should play a leading role in reducing costs and increasing procurement and sales. Wool textile enterprises should see that this is a good opportunity to adjust their product structure. This year's wool is of high quality and low price; as long as the right products are chosen, enterprises can purchase wool and invest in production to achieve great results. Herdsmen should also be cautious and not be swayed by rumors of domestic wool surplus. The wave of sheep slaughter must not be repeated; otherwise, the sheep industry will plummet, inevitably affecting the herdsmen's income.

    *Market News* also published an editorial today titled *"The 'Reservoir' Role Cannot Be Weakened,"* pointing out that for large commodities like wool, which are related to the vital interests of a wide range of herdsmen and affect the entire wool textile industry's production, state-owned commerce has the responsibility and obligation to stabilize the market through supply and demand regulation. Of course, relevant departments should provide support. The same applies to the supply and demand of other major commodities. During the rectification and tightening, it is necessary to emphasize the role of state-owned commerce as a "reservoir."

### 国产羊毛出现积压  《市场报》呼吁牧民们刀下留羊  希望工牧商三方携手克服困难

    国产羊毛出现积压
    《市场报》呼吁牧民们刀下留羊  希望工牧商三方携手克服困难
    本报讯　今年羊毛收购进入旺季以来，市场秩序见好，羊毛质量高，价格回落，但眼下牧民们手中却压着大批羊毛卖不出去。一些羊毛产区分析，今冬将可能再度刮起杀羊风。今天出版的《市场报》援引有关人士的话，大声疾呼：请刀下留羊！
    羊毛从紧俏到积压，发人深思。人们不会忘记，前几年出现“羊毛大战”，去年更为严重。由于羊毛流通秩序混乱，曾使其价格猛涨，制成品成本猛增，毛制品也随之几次涨价，超过了大多数消费者的承受能力。在今年的市场疲软中，毛制品滞销，由此也造成一连串“阻塞”：市场滞销，产品积压；企业无资金周转，无法购进原材料；供销社去年抢购的羊毛还压库至今，手中无钱收购；牧民手中大量羊毛卖不掉。
    据农业部披露，目前，新疆、内蒙古等羊毛主产区，牧民们手中压着大批质好价低的羊毛，盼有买主。据调查，内蒙古产的羊毛，有一半左右压在牧民手中，卖出的羊毛也有1／3打白条，影响了牧民们的养羊积极性，其后果令人焦虑。
    近10年来，我国曾三次出现羊毛积压，1979年积压3.2万吨，1984年积压4.39万吨，1988年积压10.4万吨，前两次都随之出现了杀羊风。这次又逢羊毛积压，《市场报》建议有关部门共同采取措施，工、牧、商三方携手共渡难关。商业部门应发挥主渠道作用，减少费用，多购多销。毛纺企业要看到现在正是企业调整产品结构的好时机。今年的羊毛质好价廉，只要选准了适销对路的产品，企业买进羊毛投入生产就能大显身手。牧民们也要谨慎从事，切莫听信什么国产羊毛过剩的传言。杀羊风不能再刮，否则，养羊业跌入低谷，势必影响牧民收入。
    《市场报》今天还发表题为《“蓄水池”作用不能削弱》的社论，指出像羊毛这类大宗商品，关系到广大牧民的切身利益，影响着整个毛纺工业的生产，国营商业有责任、有义务通过调节供求来稳定市场，当然有关部门应给予支持。羊毛如此，其它主要商品的供求也应如此。在治理整顿中，很有必要再强调发挥国营商业的“蓄水池”作用。
