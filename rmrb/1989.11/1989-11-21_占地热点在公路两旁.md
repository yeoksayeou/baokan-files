In recent years, the areas along both sides of roads have become hotspots for construction land use, leading to the large-scale occupation of arable land along national and provincial highways.

With the development of the commodity economy, many farmers have taken advantage of the convenient transportation along the roadsides to seize good land for building houses, shops, hotels, restaurants, parking lots, gas stations, processing plants, and repair shops. As farmers say, "By the roadside, money is easy to make; compared to tilling the soil, one year is like three." Some even demolished houses they moved to the mountains in the 1970s and rebuilt them along the roadsides. This trend shows no signs of abating.

Small towns are scattered along the roads like beads on a string. Many of these towns have been hastily established without considering objective economic conditions. Some towns, upgraded from villages or market towns, have leaders who want to achieve results during their term to make their towns "look like towns." They encourage residents and nearby farmers to build houses along the roads, sometimes offering various incentives to guide them.

Due to the lack of functional zoning in urban planning, buildings have been constructed in a haphazard manner, sometimes stretching for miles. According to a survey, more than 50% of the 40-plus towns in Yiyang, Hunan Province, have consumed large tracts of fertile land due to this issue.

Some places are keen on large-scale development along the roadsides, replacing the previous "farmer streets" with names like "development zones," "economic zones," and "economic corridors." They attract investments from local and external farmers to build large-scale projects, occupying extensive land along the roadsides.

In Yiyang, a county-level city, plans are underway to develop an "economic corridor" along a 20-kilometer stretch of a through highway. With favorable conditions, it attracts local and external farmers to invest and build here. Preliminary estimates suggest that 2,000 mu (approximately 133 hectares) of arable land will be needed.

The arable land along the roadsides in southern China is often high-yielding and stable-production fields after garden-style development. It is truly a shame to occupy them for non-agricultural construction.

　　占地热点在公路两旁
　　湖南省益阳地区国土管理局　罗新学　胡跃飞
    近年来，公路两旁已成为建设用地的热点，导致有的国道、省道两旁的耕地被成片占用。
    随着商品经济的发展，许多农民利用公路交通便利的地理优势，纷纷在公路两旁抢占好地建房，办商店、旅馆、饭店、停车场、加油站、加工厂、修理店。用农民的话说：
  “马路边，好挣钱；比起翻泥巴，一年当三年。”有的甚至把70年代已经搬上山的房子拆掉，建到公路边来，这种势头方兴未艾。
    小城镇如长藤结瓜，分散于各公路沿线，其中不少是不顾客观经济条件，急于求成。一些由乡改的镇、墟场升级的镇，镇领导一心想在本届任期内多出政绩，使自己领导的镇早日“像个镇”，鼓励本城镇居民和附近农民沿公路依次建房，甚至以许多优惠条件加以引导。
    由于未按城镇建设的功能分区规划，采取“蚂蚁上树式”，建到哪里算哪里，有的建成了三里五里长街。据调查，湖南益阳地区40多个建制镇，有50％以上的镇由于这个原因“吃”掉了大片良田好地。
    有些地方热衷于在公路沿线搞规模开发，由前几年的“农民街”代之以“开发区”、“经济区”、“经济长廊”等名义出现，上建设项目，大规模连片占用公路两旁土地。
    益阳地区有个县级市，规划在一条20多公里长的过境公路沿线开发“经济走廊”，以优惠条件吸引本市和外地农民来这里投资搞建设，初步匡算需占用耕地2000亩。
    公路两旁的耕地，在江南农村大都是经过田园化建设的高产稳产田，被占用搞非农业建设，实在太可惜了。
