By November 8, the Qiqihar Railway Bureau had unloaded 27,000 additional cars, and it is expected that by the end of the year, an additional 130,000 cars will have been unloaded. This is an unprecedented achievement in the 40-year history of the bureau.

Since the beginning of this year, the bureau has formulated and adjusted unloading plans in a timely manner based on the unloading capacities of various stations within the bureau. They have coordinated with various shipping points and used computer systems to transmit information to users, ensuring that the receiving units are notified within one day of the shipment of goods, allowing them to prepare for receiving and unloading the cars in advance. To ensure that loaded cars are unloaded as soon as they arrive, they have helped various enterprises organize unloading teams, providing mutual support and avoiding imbalances in workload.
