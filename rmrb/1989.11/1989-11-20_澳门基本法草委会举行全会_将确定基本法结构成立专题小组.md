Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 18th — The third plenary meeting of the Basic Law Drafting Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region opened today in Guangzhou.

The main agenda items for this meeting are to review and approve the "Draft Structure of the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China" and to divide the drafting of the Basic Law into specialized topics and establish specialized groups.

Ji Pengfei, the Chairman of the Basic Law Drafting Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region, said in his opening remarks that the Basic Law Structure Drafting Group has recently collected a wide range of materials and opinions, especially conducting a 13-day consultation in Macao, meeting with people from all walks of life in Macao, and fully listening to their opinions. After careful discussion and research, the draft of the "Draft Structure of the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China" was produced, which will be discussed at this meeting. The draft of the Basic Law Structure for discussion, except for the preamble, is divided into 9 chapters.

Lu Ping, Secretary-General of the Basic Law Drafting Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region and Convener of the Basic Law Structure Drafting Group, said that the draft of the Basic Law Structure can be said to be formed on the basis of widely listening to and soliciting opinions and suggestions from all sides. Its guiding ideology is to reflect the policy of "one country, two systems" and the spirit of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, reflect the actual situation and characteristics of Macao, and maintain the stability and development of Macao. The Basic Law should clearly stipulate some basic principles and contents, but also avoid being too detailed and restrictive on the future Special Administrative Region government.

Ji Pengfei pointed out that after this meeting determines the structure of the Basic Law and establishes specialized groups, the drafting work of the Basic Law will enter the stage of specific drafting of articles.

The meeting will continue to discuss in groups over the next two days.

In the evening, Ma Man-chi, Chairman of the Macao Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and Vice-Chairman of the Basic Law Drafting Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region, hosted a dinner for the committee members attending this meeting.

    澳门基本法草委会举行全会
    将确定基本法结构成立专题小组
    新华社广州11月18日电　（记者黄晓）澳门特别行政区基本法起草委员会第三次全体会议今天在广州开幕。
    这次会议主要有两项议程：审议并通过《中华人民共和国澳门特别行政区基本法结构（草案）》；划分起草基本法的专题和成立专题小组。
    澳门基本法起草委员会主任委员姬鹏飞在开幕致词中说，基本法结构起草小组近期广泛收集了有关资料和意见，特别是在澳门进行了为期13天的咨询工作，接触了澳门社会各界人士，充分听取了他们的意见。经过认真讨论和研究之后拟出的《中华人民共和国澳门特别行政区基本法结构（草案）》讨论稿，将提供这次会议讨论。提请本次会议审议的基本法结构（草案）讨论稿除序言外，共分9章。澳门基本法起草委员会秘书长、基本法结构（草案）起草小组召集人鲁平说，澳门基本法结构（草案）讨论稿可以说是在广泛听取和征询各方面意见和建议的基础上形成的，它的指导思想是要体现“一国两制”方针和中葡联合声明的精神，反映澳门的实际和特点，维护澳门的稳定和发展。基本法既要把一些基本的原则和内容明确地规定下来，又要避免因条文过繁细束缚将来的特别行政区政府。
    姬鹏飞指出，这次会议确定基本法的结构和成立专题小组后，基本法的起草工作将进入具体草拟条文的阶段。
    会议明后两天将继续分组讨论。
    晚上，澳门中华总商会会长、澳门基本法起草委员会副主任委员马万祺宴请出席本次会议的委员们。
