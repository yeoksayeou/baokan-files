Chen Huifen, a 26-year-old young dancer from the Nanjing Military Region Frontline Song and Dance Troupe, brought a unique artistic performance infused with the rich flavors of the Jiangnan water town to the capital's audience.

In 1975, the Nanjing Military Region Frontline Song and Dance Troupe's recruitment team came to Wuxi to enroll dance students. Among the eager children, Chen Huifen, a 12-year-old girl from the Wuxi Little Red Flower Children's Art Troupe, stood out with her expressive big eyes and natural talent for dance. She was noticed by the recruitment teachers and left her thatched-roof home in the countryside of Wuxi to begin her life as a dance student. It was then that she realized the importance of a solid foundation in dance. Rigorous training began, including leg exercises that made many children cry. Chen Huifen would quietly cover her face with a handkerchief, and after each practice, her handkerchief would be wet, whether from sweat or tears, no one knew. She eventually passed the self-study exam for the PLA Academy of Arts with the highest score among the students, becoming a professional dancer.

She participated in numerous performances, including the dance drama "Golden Phoenix," and even began to take on leading roles. For many, this might have been enough, but Chen Huifen felt her talents were not yet fully realized. She started creating her own choreography, and her debut work, "Newlywed Farewell," based on ancient poetry, was a success. This was her first self-choreographed and performed dance. Overjoyed, she set higher goals for herself, seeking a strong artistic individuality. Memories of her childhood in the countryside began to surface, leading to her award-winning and famous work, "Picking Mushrooms," which drew inspiration from Northeast folk dances and her own life experiences. "Little Sailor" vividly expressed a little sailor's love for the sea through dance. During the creation of this piece, her childhood memories helped her invent the motion of mimicking seagulls flying with her hands. No wonder this dance was particularly loved by foreign audiences during its tour in Eastern Europe. Every time she came out for a curtain call, the audience would mimic her seagull-flying gesture with their hands. These two dances later won first place in the first military dance competition and second place in the second national dance competition. In October 1986, due to long-term poverty, her health deteriorated, and she suffered from stomach bleeding. Her husband, also a dancer, Wang Yong, who had always supported her career, advised her to give up this arduous pursuit and engage in teaching for a stable life. But she stubbornly refused.

Wang Yong supported her again, and together they embarked on new creations. A new batch of works was born, such as the dance "Star River," which depicted a little girl exploring the mysteries of the universe with vivid and dreamy imagery; "Mountain Spirit," which embodied the cultural elegance of a dance poem; and "Bull and Mountain Boy," which expressed her deep love for her hometown with childhood memories as the material. "Duckling" is a true portrayal of her childhood life in Wuxi, combining the rhythms of Jiangnan folk dance with breakdancing, like a gallery of water town life.

    来自江南水乡的舞蹈家——记陈惠芬
    顾小英
    来自南京军区前线歌舞团的26岁的青年舞蹈家陈惠芬，给首都观众带来一台既有独特艺术个性又具浓郁江南水乡情调的舞蹈专场。
    1975年，南京军区前线歌舞团的招生小组来无锡招收舞蹈学员，在跃跃欲试的孩子们中间，来自无锡小红花少儿艺术团、生长于无锡绿色乡间的12岁的农家女儿陈惠芬，以她富于表情的大眼睛和舞蹈表演上特有的天赋，引起了招生老师们的注意。她终于告别了家乡的茅草屋，开始了舞蹈学员的生活。这时她才懂得作为一个演员必须要有扎实的基本功。严格的训练开始了，耗腿功，许多孩子都忍不住掉下眼泪，陈惠芬悄悄把小手绢往脸上一蒙，每次练完后小手绢都湿糊糊的，谁也不知是汗水还是泪水。她终于以学员中的最高分通过了解放军艺术学院艺术中专自学考试，成为专业舞蹈演员。
    她先后参加了舞剧《金凤凰》等众多节目的表演，她甚至开始担当一些主要角色，对一般人来说也许可以满足了，陈惠芬却不然，总觉得自己的才能未施展出。于是她开始试着给自己编舞，根据古诗编创的处女作《新婚别》成功了！这是第一个自编自跳的舞，欣喜之余，她又给自己加码；追求强烈的艺术个性。童年的乡间生活开始在她脑海里涌动，她后来的获奖成名作《采蘑菇》，是从东北秧歌等民间舞蹈中捕捉素材，根据自己的生活经验创作的。《小小水兵》则把小水兵爱大海的志趣，用舞蹈语汇生动形象地表达出来。创作这部作品时，童年的生活再次帮她创造出用手模拟海鸥飞翔的动律。难怪这个舞蹈在后来出访东欧的演出中，连外国观众都特别喜爱，每次她出来谢幕，观众就用手学她做海鸥飞翔的动作。这两个舞蹈后来在全军首届舞蹈比赛中夺魁，在全国第二届舞蹈比赛中获二等奖。1986年10月，由于长期清贫的生活，她的身体被拖垮了，胃出血。一直支持她的事业的丈夫，也是舞蹈演员的王勇心疼地劝她放弃这辛苦的求索，从事教学，过安定生活。但她执拗地回绝了。
    王勇又一次支持她，和她携手投身于新的创作。又一批新作产生了，如表现探索宇宙奥秘的小姑娘那充满绮丽梦幻的舞蹈《星星河》；如体现出舞蹈诗一般文化品格的《山鬼》；如带着对故乡真切挚爱，以童年生活为素材的《悍牛与山童》。《鸭丫头》则是无锡故乡童年生活的真实写照，形式上把江南民间舞的动律与霹雳舞结合起来，有如水乡生活的画廊。
