The State Bureau of Secrecy recently issued a notice titled "On Commending Advanced Units and Individuals Who Risked Their Lives to Protect State Secrets During the Turmoil and Riots." The notice commends 14 advanced units and 24 advanced individuals from Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Sichuan, and other provinces and cities, as well as the People's Liberation Army martial law troops.

Among the commended advanced units and individuals, there are military cryptographic personnel who, despite facing violent attacks from rioters, resolutely protected the security of codes and ensured smooth command; there are escorts who, when criminals set fire to postal carriages, bravely protected confidential mail; there are security and secrecy personnel who protected military vehicles and assisted the PLA in safeguarding a large number of secret documents, preventing them from being looted by criminals; there are neighborhood watch members who courageously rescued and protected important documents and archives from the flames; and there are university secrecy personnel who, in accordance with the law, fought against illegal student organizations and prevented the further spread of state secrets. These advanced examples all share the common trait of being loyal to their duties, valuing state secrets above their own lives, and demonstrating high political awareness, a strong sense of responsibility, and a strong sense of secrecy. In critical situations, they acted bravely and intelligently, making significant contributions to the protection of the Party and state secrets.

The State Bureau of Secrecy calls on all regions, departments, and units to take these advanced examples as models, strengthen and improve secrecy work in the new situation, ensure the safety of Party and state secrets, and guarantee and promote the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and socialist construction.

The State Bureau of Secrecy also issued a notice commending the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Secrecy for their outstanding performance in maintaining their posts and continuing their work during the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots in the capital, successfully completing their tasks.
