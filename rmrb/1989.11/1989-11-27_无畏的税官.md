The title "Iron Tax Official" is what people have given to Zhang Risheng, the head of the Supervision Department at the Tai Dong Branch of the Qingdao City Tax Bureau. For this iron-willed and impartial comrade, who has dedicated thirty-eight years to the tax front, there are many who respect and praise him, but there are also those who harbor resentment.

One night in March 1987, after a busy day, Zhang Risheng was about to rest when he heard a sudden knocking at the door. His wife opened the door, and upon seeing the visitor, Zhang Risheng understood everything. It turned out that this individual, known as "Roller Meat," had colluded with outsiders to sell bicycles illegally, evading taxes amounting to 46,000 yuan, and had been caught by the Supervision Department.

The man said to Zhang, "Uncle, please show some mercy and let me keep my livelihood." Zhang replied sternly, "I'm afraid I can't accommodate you." Seeing that soft tactics wouldn't work, the man scowled, "You better be clear about this, let me go or else you'll see what I'm made of!" Zhang smiled coldly, "You're welcome to try." With that, he had the man escorted out.

The more than 200 staff members of the Tai Dong Tax Bureau will never forget a few incidents that happened among them: The Supervision Department discovered that there were also some disciplinary issues within their own ranks.

For these actions that infringed upon the dignity of tax laws and tarnished tax discipline, Zhang Risheng always stepped forward, handling them without mercy, and reporting them to higher authorities for serious punishment.

In late 1988, they uncovered a case where an unlicensed vendor used a certain unit's invoices and blank introduction letters, operating under the name of that unit's small shop, engaging in illegal sales and fraud, evading taxes totaling 16,000 yuan. To avoid punishment, the vendor attempted to bribe Zhang Risheng with gifts. Taking advantage of Zhang's absence, the vendor delivered dried abalone and sea cucumber to his home. Zhang's wife said to the vendor, "Take these back, you know Zhang's temper." Without a word, the vendor left a note and hurried away. Upon returning home and seeing this, Zhang simply said, "Old method, send it back!" The next day, his wife returned the gifts unopened.

As an old comrade, Zhang Risheng pays attention to the ideological and political work of young comrades, helping them solve practical difficulties in life, and turning a tangled mess into a cohesive unit.

In just two years since its establishment, the Supervision Department has handled over ninety cases of tax evasion, recovering and fining over 2.3 million yuan in taxes; they have also handled nine internal cases. For this, the department has been named an "Advanced Unit in Financial and Tax Inspection" by the province and city for two consecutive years, and Zhang Risheng has been named an "Advanced Individual in Financial and Tax Inspection" by the province and city for two consecutive years. This September, he was also named a National Tax System Labor Model; the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee awarded him the title of Outstanding Communist Party Member.

　　无畏的税官
　　徐磊　成占钦
      “铁税官”是人们送给青岛市税务局台东分局监察科科长张日升的一个雅号。对这位铁面无私、在税务战线上辛勤奉献了三十八个春秋的老同志，敬佩、称颂者可谓其多，怨恨者也不少。
    一九八七年三月的一天夜里，忙碌了一天的张日升刚要休息，突然传来一阵急促的敲门声。老伴打开房门后，老张一看来人，心里什么都明白了。原来这个外号叫“滚刀肉”的个体户，与外地不法分子勾结，倒卖自行车，偷漏税款四万六千余元，被监察科查获了。
    他对老张说：“大叔！您高抬贵手，给我留下一口饭吃吧。”“你这个样子，恕我不接待。”老张正色道。这家伙一看软的不行，便把脸一沉：“你放明白点，让我过去便罢，不然我也不是吃素的！”老张冷笑一声：“你请便。”说完便把他“请”了出去。
    台东税务分局两百多名干部、职工谁也不会忘记发生在他们身边的几件事：监察科的同志在外查时发现，自己内部也存在一些违纪问题。
    对这些侵犯税法尊严，败坏税风税纪的行为，张日升总是挺身而出，毫不留情地进行查处，并报请上级主管部门给予严肃处理。
    一九八八年底，他们查获了一无证商贩盗用某单位的发票、空白介绍信并以该单位小卖部的名义，进行非法贩卖和诈骗活动，偷漏税款一万六千元。为了逃避惩罚，该商贩企图以“送礼”、“贿赂”的手段堵住张日升的嘴。这位商贩趁张日升外出之际，上门送来了干贝、鲍鱼等贵重礼物。他老伴对商贩说：“你拿回去吧，老张的脾气你又不是不知道。”商贩二话没讲，只留下一张纸条，便匆匆溜走了。张日升回家见此情景，只说了句：“老办法，送回去！”第二天，他老伴把礼物原封不动地退了回去。
    作为老同志，张日升注重做好青年同志的思想政治工作，并帮助他们解决生活中的实际困难，硬把一团“乱麻”拧成了“一股绳”。
    监察科在组建仅两年的时间里，共查处偷漏税案件九十多起，查补税款和罚款二百三十多万元；监察处理内部案件九起。为此，全科连续两年被省、市评为“财务税收大检查”先进单位，张日升也连续两年被评为省、市“财税大检查”先进个人。今年九月，他又被评为全国税务系统劳动模范；青岛市委授予他优秀共产党员的称号。
