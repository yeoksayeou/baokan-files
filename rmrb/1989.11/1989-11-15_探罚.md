    The Problem of Illegal Checkpoints and Fines
    By Reporter Wang Weixiang

    Carrying the concerns of truck drivers about issues on the road, the reporter recently visited the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Public Security.

    According to relevant officials from both ministries, setting up checkpoints on roads involves more than ten departments, including public security, communications, commerce, taxation, forestry (mainly in forest areas), agricultural machinery, and health quarantine. Some townships and villages also set up their own checkpoints to stop and check vehicles, collecting fees. Due to poor management, in recent years, the problems of setting up checkpoints arbitrarily, stopping vehicles indiscriminately, and imposing fines excessively have been very serious. Some traffic management personnel impose high fines for traffic violations; some do so arbitrarily, collecting so-called "negotiated fees"; some impose fines and impound vehicles even when there is no basis for doing so, and some even openly demand money. Although the public security and communications departments have taken some measures, the problems have not been fundamentally resolved. The causes of the above problems are:

    First, there are two different "regulations." The issue of setting up checkpoints on roads is addressed in Article 33 of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Road Management" issued by the State Council on October 13, 1987, which states: "With the approval of the provincial, autonomous regional, or municipal governments, the road management authorities can set up toll collection points and road toll inspection stations at necessary road intersections, bridgeheads, ferry crossings, and tunnel entrances." However, Article 68 of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Road Traffic Management" issued by the State Council on March 9, 1988, stipulates that "except for public security organs, other departments are not allowed to set up checkpoints on roads to intercept and inspect vehicles. If relevant departments need to conduct inspections on the road, they can send personnel to participate in the public security checkpoints. In areas without public security checkpoints, if relevant departments need to set up checkpoints, they must obtain approval from the public security organs." This creates some inconveniences and conflicts for the public security and communications departments in their work. Some places set up joint checkpoints, while others set up their own checkpoints, collecting their own fees, resulting in multiple checkpoints, multiple fees, and chaotic collections. They hope that the relevant departments of the State Council will quickly provide legislative interpretations.

    Second, local regulations have many loopholes. In addition to national regulations, each place has its own set of local regulations and rules in traffic management. This often leads to disputes and fines when vehicles operate across provinces and regions. For example, the annual inspection of vehicle operation permits is not uniformly regulated by the relevant national departments. Sometimes, a province that has already conducted the annual inspection may impose penalties on vehicles that have not undergone the annual inspection. Some regions require that transport vehicles must be equipped with protective nets or rear bumpers, while others do not have this requirement. Therefore, when drivers take their vehicles on the road, they may sometimes be fined for not having these devices, and sometimes be fined for having them, which is both laughable and tearful.

    Third, "fines" have become a means of making money. For those who violate traffic management regulations, heavy penalties and light education are imposed, and some even have predetermined fine targets. Both units and individuals benefit. For example, the traffic police headquarters of a certain province once proposed the policy of "law-based management, broadening financial sources, and self-sufficiency," making the law enforcement public security organs directly participate in social economic activities and management, turning the traffic supervision team, which has a wide range of involvement, strong policy, mass, and technical characteristics, and traffic management regulations into executors and coercive means of various money-making methods. According to incomplete statistics, over the past year, some provincial traffic management departments have added and expanded 34 new fee items, one of which is various types of fines.

    To reduce the arbitrariness and unnecessary disputes in the execution of fines by traffic police, Beijing, Liaoning, Jilin, Guangdong, Hebei, and other provinces and cities have formulated the "Traffic Violation Penalty Scale" based on local conditions, specifying the penalties, especially the amount of fines, and keeping them within the department. The practice has proven to be effective. It is hoped that the public security and traffic management departments will work closely together, strictly follow the relevant national regulations, and fundamentally improve the order of highway traffic, solving the problems of arbitrary fees and excessive fines.

    探罚
    本报记者　王维香
    带着汽车司机行车中的头疼事，记者最近走访了交通部和公安部。
    据两部有关部门的同志介绍，在道路上设置检查站，涉及公安、交通、工商、税务、林业（主要在林区）、农机、卫生检疫等十几个部门。有些地方的乡镇、村民也自行设卡拦车检查、收费。由于管理混乱，近年来乱设卡、乱拦车、滥罚款的现象十分严重。有的交通管理人员对违章驾车罚款幅度大，数额高；有的随心所欲，罚所谓“议价款”；有的本来不该罚款的也找茬罚款、扣车，有的甚至公开索要钱财。虽然公安、交通等部门都分别采取过一些措施，但问题仍未从根本上得到解决。造成上述问题的原因：
    一是两个“条例”有不同。在道路上设立检查站问题，1987年10月13日国务院发布的《中华人民共和国公路管理条例》第33条指出：“经省、自治区、直辖市人民政府批准，公路主管部门可以在必要的公路路口、桥头、渡口、隧道路口设立收取车辆通行费的站卡及公路征费稽查站”。而1988年3月9日国务院发布的《中华人民共和国道路交通管理条例》第68条则规定“除公安机关外，其他部门不准在道路上设置检查站拦截、检查车辆。有关部门确需上路进行检查时，可派人参加公安机关的检查站进行工作。没有公安检查站的地区，有关部门如需要设置检查站时，必须经公安机关批准。”这就给公安部门和交通部门在工作中造成了一些不便和矛盾。有的地方是联合设站，有的地方则是各设各的站，各收各的钱，站多、卡多、收费乱。他们希望国务院有关部门尽快作出立法解释。
    二是地方法规空子多。在交通管理方面，除了全国性法规以外，各地还有一套自己的地方性法规、条例。这样在汽车跨省、区运营时，往往会出现扯皮、罚款现象。比如车辆营运证的年度审验，国家有关部门在时间上没有统一规定，有时已经进行年审的省份就可能要对没有进行年审的车辆给予处罚。有的地区规定，运输车辆必须安装防护网或后保险杠，有的则没有这项规定，因而司机驾车上路后，有时因车上无此装置被处罚，有时又因有此装置被罚款，让人哭笑不得。
    三是“罚款”成了生财之道。对违反交通管理的人，重处罚、轻教育，有的甚至内定罚款指标。单位、个人都得到好处。如有的省公安交警总队就曾提出“依法管理，广开财源，自食其力”的方针，使执法的公安机关直接参与社会经济活动和管理，把交通监理这支涉及面广，政策性、群众性、技术性很强的国家执法队伍和交通管理法规，变成了种种生财之道的执行者和强制手段。据不完全统计，一年多来，有的省交通管理部门新增加和扩大的收费项目就有34种，其中一项就是各种名目的罚款。
    为了减少交通民警执行处罚的随意性和不必要的争议，目前，北京、辽宁、吉林、广东、河北等省市结合本地实际制定了《交通违章处罚尺度一览表》，把对违章的处罚特别是罚款金额具体化，内部掌握，实践证明效果是好的。希望公安交通管理部门密切合作，严格按照国家有关规定，切实改善公路交通秩序，从根本上解决乱收费、滥罚款的问题。
