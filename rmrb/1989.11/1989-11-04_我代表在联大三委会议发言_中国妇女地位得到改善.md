China's representative, Du Yong, spoke at the 44th session of the UN General Assembly's Third Committee on the issue of women. He stated that Chinese women have made significant progress in their struggle for equal rights, participation in comprehensive development, and the maintenance of world peace.

Du Yong said, "In recent years, the deepening of reform in our country has opened up broader prospects for Chinese women to participate extensively in the political life of the state, as well as in economic and cultural construction. Chinese women's political awareness has been continuously enhanced, and they have actively participated in the management and supervision of social affairs."

Du Yong also pointed out that currently, Chinese women still face some problems, such as the persistence of phenomena where women are looked down upon or even discriminated against. Due to the development of the commodity economy, women encounter new challenges in areas such as education, employment, and political participation. To address these issues, the Chinese government and women's organizations will take further measures to overcome difficulties and gradually resolve these problems.

Du Yong also called on more countries to ratify and join the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, making it more universal.

This December 18th marks the 10th anniversary of the UN General Assembly's adoption of the Convention. Over the past 10 years, the Convention has played a positive role in promoting women's legal equality worldwide.

China is one of the signatory countries of the Convention and ratified it on November 4, 1980. To date, 99 countries have ratified or joined the Convention.

    我代表在联大三委会议发言
    中国妇女地位得到改善
    本报联合国11月1日电  记者刘开宸报道：中国代表杜勇在第44届联大第三委员会会议上审议关于妇女问题时发言说，中国妇女在争取妇女的平等权利、参与全面发展和维护世界和平的事业中取得了一定的进展。
    杜勇说，“近年来，我国改革的深入为中国妇女广泛参与国家政治生活，经济和文化建设开辟了更为广阔的天地；中国妇女的参政意识不断增强，积极参与了社会事务的管理和监督活动。”
    杜勇还指出，当前中国妇女仍面临着一些问题，如轻视甚至歧视妇女的现象仍然存在；由于商品经济的发展，妇女在受教育、就业、参政等方面遇到了一些新的挑战等。对此，中国政府和妇女组织等，将采取进一步措施，克服困难，逐步解决。
    杜勇还呼吁更多国家批准加入《消除对妇女一切形式歧视公约》，使其更具有普遍性。
    今年12月18日是联合国大会通过该公约10周年。10年来，《消除对妇女一切形式歧视公约》对促进世界妇女在法律方面的平等地位起了积极作用。
    中国是该公约签字国之一，并已于1980年11月4日批准加入。迄今共有99国批准或加入了《公约》。
