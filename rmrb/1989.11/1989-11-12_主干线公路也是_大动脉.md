The transportation industries of various countries around the world have generally experienced or are currently experiencing stages of development that include waterway development, railway development, road and civil aviation development, and coordinated development of comprehensive transportation. In different stages of development, the structure of transportation also needs to be adjusted according to the adjustments in social and economic structures. Currently, many countries are strengthening the construction of national trunk road systems, playing a very important role in the entire transportation industry. For example, data from 1986 shows that the mileage of interstate highways in the United States accounts for only 1.1% of the total national highway mileage, but they bear 21.3% of the national automobile turnover volume.

Regarding the position of highways, especially the national trunk road system, in the entire transportation industry, it is a very important issue. If highways are still considered merely as a means of local transportation connecting urban and rural areas, then various "reverse tilt" policies in highway construction cannot be fundamentally corrected. Only by starting from the need to adjust the transportation structure and develop comprehensive transportation, recognizing that the highway network is multi-tiered and the role of highways is multifaceted, and recognizing that the national trunk road system should be an important component of the national comprehensive transportation "major arteries," can the problem of "reverse tilt" be solved.

    主干线公路也是“大动脉”
    交通部公路规划设计院副院长　庞俊达
    世界各国交通运输业，大体都经历了或正在经历着水运发展阶段、铁路发展阶段、公路和民航发展阶段、综合运输协调发展阶段的发展过程。在不同的发展阶段，交通运输结构也都要随着社会、经济结构的调整而调整。目前，许多国家都加强了全国性干线公路系统的建设，在整个交通运输业中起到十分重要的作用。例如1986年的资料表明，美国州际公路里程只占全国公路总里程的1.1％，却承担着全国21.3％的汽车周转量。
    对于公路，特别是国道主干线公路系统在整个交通运输业中所处地位的认识，是一个很重要的问题。如果仍然认为公路只是一种沟通城乡的地方交通运输方式，那么公路建设上的种种“倒倾斜”政策是不可能彻底改正的。只有从调整运输结构，发展综合运输的需要出发，认识到公路网是多层次的，公路的作用也是多重性的，认识到国道主干线公路系统应是全国综合运输“大动脉”的一个重要组成部分，“倒倾斜”的问题才能解决。
