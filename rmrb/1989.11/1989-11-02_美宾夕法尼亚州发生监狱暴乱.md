    Prison riots broke out in the Camp Hill prison in Pennsylvania, USA, in late October, resulting in over 120 inmates, guards, and police officers injured. Out of the prison's 31 buildings, 14 were burned down. Authorities managed to regain control of the situation by the morning of the 27th.

    According to reports, the riots were sparked by the inmates' anger over the authorities' restrictions on medical treatment and the prohibition of family members from sending food. Prison officials stated that overcrowding also exacerbated the severity of the riots.

    美宾夕法尼亚州发生监狱暴乱
    美国宾夕法尼亚州坎普山监狱十月下旬连续发生两起严重暴乱，造成囚犯、警卫及警察共一百二十余人受伤，整个监狱的三十一坐建筑物中有十四座被焚毁。当局直至二十七日晨才控制了局面。
    据报道，囚犯暴乱的原因是他们对当局限制就医、禁家属送食品感到愤怒。该监狱官员说，人满为患也加剧了暴乱的严重性。　（本报专电）
