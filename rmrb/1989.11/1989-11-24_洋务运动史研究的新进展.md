In late October, the fifth academic symposium on the Self-Strengthening Movement was held in Dongying City. The symposium was jointly organized by Shandong University, the editorial departments of "Historical Research" and "Modern History Research," and relevant units in Dongying City. Over 130 scholars and historians from across the country gathered to seriously discuss the theme of "The Self-Strengthening Movement and China's Modernization."

The Self-Strengthening Movement, which took place from the 1860s to the 1890s, was a significant event in modern Chinese history. It not only affected the emergence and development of Chinese capitalism, the old class divisions, and the appearance of new classes, but also influenced various aspects of China's politics, economy, military, thought, and culture at that time. Moreover, it had a multifaceted impact on the subsequent development of Chinese society.

In the past decade, the study of the Self-Strengthening Movement has become a hot topic in the research of modern Chinese history, yielding new achievements. Four national symposia on the Self-Strengthening Movement have been held, but previous discussions and research have focused on "rehabilitating" the Self-Strengthening Movement, with more debates on its nature and a tendency to emphasize micro-level aspects. This symposium, building on the rich achievements of previous symposia, has opened up many new research areas. Many representatives proposed paying attention to the relationship between the Self-Strengthening Movement and the modern social environment of China, and presented new insights on the impact of the international environment, domestic political environment, and economic environment on the Self-Strengthening Movement at that time. Some representatives discussed the relationship between the Self-Strengthening Movement and China's modernization. The following is a brief introduction to the related issues discussed at the symposium:

1. The relationship between Empress Dowager Cixi and the Self-Strengthening Movement. The representatives at the symposium believed that to deepen the research on the history of the Self-Strengthening Movement, it is necessary to study the political environment at that time, especially the relationship with the highest ruler of the Qing government—Empress Dowager Cixi. Some scholars pointed out that Cixi was the top decision-maker in the Qing court, and without her approval, the Self-Strengthening Movement could not have been carried out. Cixi had a supportive side towards the Self-Strengthening Movement, such as the Tongwen Guan incident, which ultimately ended with the defeat of the conservative faction led by Wu Reng. However, her support had its limits, as it could not affect her feudal autocratic rule. In the past discussions on the Self-Strengthening Movement, there was not enough attention paid to Cixi. Some scholars believed that the relationship between Cixi and the Self-Strengthening Movement should be analyzed in stages. Before the Sino-French War, Cixi was relatively supportive of the Self-Strengthening Movement, but after the war, she focused more on consolidating her power and balancing the influence of the Self-Strengthening faction and the conservative faction. Cixi's support for the Self-Strengthening Movement was more out of political expediency than genuine conviction. She differed from Self-Strengthening leaders such as Zeng Guofan, Zuo Zongtang, and Li Hongzhang. Some scholars believed that the relationship between Cixi and the Self-Strengthening Movement was quite complex. The initiators of the Self-Strengthening Movement were Zeng, Zuo, and Li, and although Cixi was the top decision-maker, she was not a reformer. She had not received systematic education and had only participated in a few political affairs during the Rehe period under the Emperor Xianfeng, which was a crucial time for the Qing government's internal and external policy changes. This had a significant impact on her later thoughts.

2. The Self-Strengthening Movement and the social environment. Some scholars pointed out that the social environment of the Self-Strengthening Movement was broad, including China's economy, politics, society, culture, people's thoughts, styles, and qualities at that time.

Some scholars believed that the political environment, in addition to the top leaders, also required a group. Peter the Great of Russia relied on the nobility, and Japan's Meiji Restoration relied on lower-level samurai. Generally, their qualities were better, with modern concepts, and the reforms were ultimately successful. However, in China, the Self-Strengthening Movement relied on the Self-Strengthening faction, which, except for a few officials like Liu Kunyi and Zhang Zhidong, were generally timid and lacked vitality and quality. Some scholars pointed out that the Self-Strengthening Movement lasted for thirty years without establishing corresponding institutions, such as the Ministry of Agriculture or the Ministry of Commerce, and did not formulate a set of policies. At that time, the export goods were tea and raw silk, but there was no specialized institution to lead the improvement of the deteriorating quality of silk and tea, no institution to encourage private factories, and no institution to research and restrict imported goods, etc. Some scholars pointed out that the Qing government also had a conflict between the Manchus and the Han Chinese. The Qing government had a distrustful attitude towards Han Chinese officials, which led to Han Chinese officials being very timid. The reasons for the failure of the Self-Strengthening Movement should also consider this factor. Some scholars also believed that in the past, we evaluated the figures of the Self-Strengthening Movement only from the perspective of enterprises, which is not clear. At that time, the social environment was one of Western influence, and Confucian thought had produced a crisis of faith, leading to the emergence of Self-Strengthening thoughts among intellectuals. As for the corruption in Self-Strengthening enterprises, it is also necessary to consider whether it was caused by opening up to the outside world or by the problems of traditional Chinese society itself.

3. The characteristics of China's early modernization as seen from the Self-Strengthening Movement. Some scholars believed that China's modernization began with the Self-Strengthening Movement, which was initiated by the Self-Strengthening faction under the historical condition that China had already become a semi-colonial society. By examining the early stage of China's modernization through the Self-Strengthening Movement, it can be clearly seen that it has the following characteristics different from the modernization of Western countries: First, in Western countries, the task of achieving modernization was always undertaken by the bourgeoisie. In China, there had never been a series of movements like the Renaissance, Enlightenment, bourgeois revolution, and industrial revolution in Europe, and until the 1860s, Chinese society had not yet seen the emergence of the bourgeoisie. The more China lagged behind in the world capitalism, the greater the risk of being swallowed by capitalist powers. History forced China to make a choice: either to modernize and adapt to the trend of world capitalism or to remain stagnant and face extinction. Second, unlike the sequence of industrial development in Western capitalist countries, the Self-Strengthening faction started modern industry with military industry and then expanded to civilian enterprises. They started with heavy industry and then expanded to light industry. This was determined by China's social and historical conditions at that time. Third, unlike the "private operation" method of developing industry in Western capitalist countries, the Self-Strengthening faction established modern industry through "government operation" and "government-supervised merchant operation." This was a special form of industrial development in the early stage of China's modernization as a semi-colonial country, which was suitable for China's national conditions at that time.

The symposium also discussed issues such as the connotation, periodization, path, characteristics of China's modernization, and the role of the Self-Strengthening Movement in the process of China's modernization.

　　洋务运动史研究的新进展
    10月下旬，由山东大学、《历史研究》、《近代史研究》编辑部和东营市有关单位联合举办的第五届洋务运动史学术讨论会在东营市举行。来自全国130名学者与史学工作者围绕着“洋务运动与中国近代化”这一主题进行认真的探讨。
    发生于十九世纪六十年代至九十年代的洋务运动是中国近代史上的一件大事。它不仅关系到中国资本主义的产生和发展，关系到旧的阶级分化和新的阶级出现，关系到当时中国的政治、经济、军事、思想、文化等各个领域的变化，而且也对后来的中国社会发展产生了多方面的影响。
    近十年来，洋务运动史研究成为中国近代史研究中的一个热点，取得了新的成果。全国性的洋务运动史讨论会已举行过四届，但过去的讨论和研究，着重于为洋务运动“正名”，对性质的争论较多，偏重于微观方面的多。而这次会议在历次洋务运动史学术讨论会所取得丰富成果的基础上，开拓了许多新的研究领域。不少代表提出要注意研究洋务运动与中国近代社会环境的关系，并就当时的国际环境、国内政治环境和经济环境对洋务运动的影响，提出了一些新的见解。有的代表则探讨了洋务运动与中国近代化的关系。现将讨论中的有关问题简介如下：
    一、慈禧太后与洋务运动的关系。与会代表认为，要使洋务运动史的研究深入下去，就必须研究当时的政治环境，特别是同清政府中的最高统治者——慈禧太后的关系。有的学者认为，慈禧是清廷最高决策人，没有她的首肯，洋务运动是搞不起来的。慈禧有支持洋务运动的一面，如同文馆事件，最后以顽固派倭仁的失败告终。但她的支持有一个限度，即不能影响其封建专制统治。过去在讨论洋务运动时，对慈禧注意得很不够。有的学者认为，对慈禧同洋务运动的关系要划阶段分析。中法战争前，慈禧对洋务运动比较支持，战后她更注重巩固自己的权势，驾驭和平衡洋务派和顽固派这两大集团的势力。慈禧支持洋务运动，与其说是政治主张，不如说是权术的需要。她同曾国藩、左宗棠、李鸿章等洋务派大官僚是有所不同的。有的学者认为，慈禧同洋务运动的关系相当复杂。洋务运动的发起人是曾、左、李等人，慈禧虽为最高决策人，但并非改革家。她没有受过系统的教育，只是热河期间在咸丰皇帝身边参与几件政事，而那时正是清政府内外政策转变的重要时期，这对她以后的思想影响很大。
    二、洋务运动与社会环境。一些学者指出，洋务运动的社会环境，范围很广，包括当时中国的经济、政治、社会、文化、人的思想、作风和素质，等等。
    有的学者认为，政治环境除了最高的领导者外，还要有一个集团。俄国彼得大帝依靠贵族，日本明治维新依靠下级武士，一般来说，他们的素质较好，有现代观念，改革最后成功了；而中国靠的是洋务派，这个集团，除个别官员如刘坤一、张之洞比较强以外，一般来说，都比较胆小怕事，没有活力，素质较差。有些学者指出，洋务运动搞了三十年，没有建立相应的机构，如农业部、商业部，也未制定一套政策。当时出口物是茶叶与生丝，但没有一个专门机构来领导改良丝、茶品种的日趋退化，没有一个机构鼓励私人办厂，也没有一个机构来研究、限制舶来品，等等。有的学者指出，当时清政府还有一个满汉之间的矛盾，清政府对汉族官员有一个不信任的态度，所以造成汉族官员十分胆小怕事。洋务运动失败的原因，也应把这个因素考虑进去。有的学者还认为，过去我们对洋务运动人物的评价，只是从企业讲是讲不清的，当时的社会环境是西风东渐，儒家思想已产生了信仰危机，在知识分子中产生了洋务思想。至于洋务企业的腐败现象，也要考虑究竟它是对外开放引起的，还是中国传统社会本身的问题。
    三、从洋务运动看中国近代化早期的特点。一些学者发言认为，中国的近代化，是在中国社会已经沦为半殖民地的历史条件下，由洋务派倡导的洋务运动开始起步的。通过洋务运动来考察中国近代化的早期阶段，可以明显地看出它具有如下几个不同于西方国家近代化的特点：第一、在西方国家中，实现近代化的任务始终是由资产阶级承担的；在中国没有发生过像欧洲那样的文艺复兴、启蒙运动、资产阶级革命、产业革命等一系列运动，直到十九世纪六十年代，中国社会还没有出现资产阶级。中国越落在世界资本主义的后面，就越有被资本主义列强侵吞的危险，历史迫使中国作出抉择：要么走向近代化，适合世界资本主义的潮流；要么守旧不变，自取灭亡。第二、与西方资本主义国家发展工业的先后顺序不同，洋务派创办近代工业，是先从军事工业开始，然后扩展到民用企业；先从重工业开始，然后扩充到轻工业。这是当时中国的社会历史条件所决定的。第三、与西方资本主义国家通过“民办”方式发展工业不同，洋务派通过“官办”、“官督商办”的方式创办近代工业。这是半殖民地中国在近代化早期阶段发展工业的一种特殊形式，适合当时中国的国情。
    会议还探讨了中国近代化的内涵、分期、途径、特点以及洋务运动在中国近代化进程中的作用等问题。
