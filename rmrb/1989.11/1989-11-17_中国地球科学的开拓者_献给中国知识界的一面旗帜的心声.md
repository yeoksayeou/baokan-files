	Ideas rush through the mind all night long,
	At dawn, you sit at your desk and dream, your silver hair gleaming.
	The passage of time has indeed etched many wrinkles on you,
	But it has also made you cherish every precious moment.
	Do you not love the colorful life?
	Do you not understand the hearts of your family?
	Remember: on the grassy field of Qingqiao, you spent your honeymoon,
	But a small stone caught your passionate gaze;
	Remember: your loving wife waited for you to share a feast,
	But you were engrossed in your books, forgetting the soy sauce by your side...
	Is it just for your own fleeting thoughts?
	Is it just to compete for a day's length?
	Remember: the Lu Mountain Geological Museum was destroyed,
	You were sad for a long time, worrying about the rise and fall of the Chinese nation;
	Remember: when New China rose from the East,
	You pushed aside the distractions, crossing the ocean to return home;
	Remember: you pioneered geomechanics,
	Unafraid of slander and false accusations, your heart was so open...
	Ah, Li Siguang! Though you are old, your aspirations are still burning,
	The path of seeking truth from facts is becoming wider and longer.
	The depths of the earth are not mysterious and unfathomable,
	The determined will eventually awaken the black nectar that has slept for thousands of years.
	The crying orphan on your shoulders, how much weight does it bear?
	The trembling earth, how can it be allowed to be so crazy forever!
	Ah, Li Siguang! Your mind is so rich,
	Decades of accumulation make it dare to compete with the earth.
	Ah, Li Siguang! Though your black hair has faded,
	What you give to the people is an endless treasure.

   中国地球科学的开拓者
   ——献给中国知识界的一面旗帜的心声
    李向晨
   脑海里奔涌通宵难尽的遐想，
   曦微中伏案入梦，满头银丝闪亮。
   岁月的刀痕固然给你刻上不少皱纹，
   却也使你愈加珍惜宝贵的时光。
   难道你真的不热爱多彩的生活？
   难道你真的不理解妻孥的心肠？
   曾记否：青郊草坪上度蜜月，
   一枚片石却牵住你痴情的目光；
   曾记否：爱妻恭候你共进丰餐，
   你却迷恋着书本，调味酱油忘一旁……
   难道你仅仅是为一己的杂念？
   难道你仅仅是竞一日之短长？
   曾记否：庐山地质博物馆被摧毁，
   你怅恨良久，担忧中华民族的兴亡；
   曾记否：当新中国从东方崛起，
   你力排纷扰，飘洋过海返回家乡；
   曾记否：你首创地质力学，
   不怕谗言诬陷，心胸何其坦荡……
   呵，李四光！年事虽高仍襟抱热望，
   上下求索的修远路途又加宽加长。
   地球的深层并非玄奥莫测，
   有志者终于唤醒沉睡千年的黑色琼浆。
   怀抱啼哭的孤儿，肩头担起多大份量？
   抖动的大地呵，哪容你永远这样疯狂！
   呵，李四光！你的脑海是多么富有，
   几十年的积蓄使它敢跟地球较量。
   呵，李四光！你满头的青丝虽已耗尽，
   给予人民的却是无尽的宝藏。
