The third plenary session of the Basic Law Drafting Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region concluded this afternoon in Guangzhou.

The 46 committee members, after three days of heated discussions, reviewed and approved the "Draft Structure of the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China" and the "Decision of the Basic Law Drafting Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China on Establishing Special Topic Groups." They also established five special topic groups focusing on the relationship between the central government and the Macao Special Administrative Region, the basic rights and duties of residents, the political system, the economy, and cultural and social affairs.

At the closing meeting, Ma Jiefang, Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and Chairman of the Basic Law Drafting Committee for Macao, delivered a summary speech. He said that the draft structure of the Basic Law approved just now is only an outline, and in the subsequent drafting process, it can be adjusted and modified as necessary based on the actual situation in Macao and various opinions. Ma Jiefang said that drafting the Basic Law well requires the concerted efforts of all committee members. Of course, in the drafting process, different views on certain issues are inevitable, but as long as everyone adheres to the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation, consensus can definitely be reached. He said that to do a good job in drafting the Basic Law, we still need to continue to listen to opinions from all sides, especially from Macao.

After the publication of the "Draft Structure of the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region," the drafting work of the Basic Law will enter a new stage. The special topic groups will conduct investigations and research to prepare for the drafting of relevant chapters and articles. This meeting decided that the fourth plenary session of the Basic Law Drafting Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region will be held in Beijing from June 7 to 9, 1990.

Ma Jiefang hosted a banquet at the White Swan Hotel this evening to entertain the drafting committee members attending the meeting. Lin Ruo, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee, attended the banquet.
