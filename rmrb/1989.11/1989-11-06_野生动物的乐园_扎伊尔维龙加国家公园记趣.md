One day, the reporter flew from Goma and then took a jeep northward. The vehicle bounced along the road covered with volcanic ash. After passing through the volcanic area, we entered a dense, primeval forest. The deeper we went, the fewer people we saw. By the time we reached the Erwandi Hotel inside Virunga Park, it was already dusk.

"Virunga" in the local language means "remote mountain range." The park was established in 1925, primarily to protect the rare mountain gorillas. The park is 300 kilometers long and covers 800,000 hectares. After two expansions in 1930 and 1935, it reached its current size. Here, nature is perfectly and ideally preserved, with no signs of human interference or destruction. The northern and western parts are the sprawling Mitumba Mountains, the eastern part is the sparkling Lake Albert and the towering Rwenzori Mountains, with the rare "equatorial snow" on the peak of Mount Margherita. The southern part is a volcanic area, where the Nyiragongo Volcano erupted in 1986. The southeastern part also has the Ruchuru River Falls. Some say this land is a "masterpiece of mountains and water," gathering all kinds of natural wonders. There are also over a hundred species of wildlife, including gorillas, lions, elephants, hippopotamuses, wild oxen, warthogs, hyenas, and more.

The next morning, the park guide took us to see lions. He said there were three giant lions just in the grass near the hotel. When we followed the guide to the spot, we saw the lions had already moved into the thicket of the valley. According to the guide, there are over 500 lions in the park. After they feast at night, they hide and rest as soon as the sun comes up, making them hard to spot.

Morning is the best time to observe animals. Without having breakfast, we set off enthusiastically. Along the way, the first thing that caught our eyes was the vast expanse of antelopes covering the hills. Some were grazing, some were looking around, and some were chasing and playing with each other. On this boundless grassland, antelopes are often the delicious prey of predators. According to the guide, a fully grown lion needs to eat 20 kilograms of meat per day. If a lion catches one antelope per day, in a year, just the lions would eat 80,000 antelopes. The abundance of antelopes in Virunga Park is thus evident.

It is known that, apart from over 500 lions, Virunga Park is home to 2,000 elephants, 30,000 hippopotamuses, 15,000 wild oxen, 5,000 warthogs, and 250 gorillas. The valley forests are also inhabited by leopards. Additionally, there are countless monkeys and baboons, which often block the cars and demand food. Sometimes, they even gather in groups to run into the hotel courtyard. If you are not careful, they will sneak into the car or house, causing a mess. The hippopotamuses in Virunga Park are also innumerable, making it the place with the highest concentration of hippopotamuses in the world. Almost every river has them. One year, the hippopotamuses blocked a river, causing the upstream area to flood.

Anyone who comes to the park will feel greatly disappointed if they do not see elephants. We searched for half a day but still did not see any elephants, so we returned to the hotel dejected. Not long after we returned, the guide said he had found a herd of elephants. Forgetting the day's fatigue, we set off enthusiastically again. When we drove to a hillside, we saw a group of elephants slowly walking up from the valley. I counted, and there were over 80. African elephants are larger than Asian elephants, stronger, and have longer tusks. In the hotel's reception room, a pair of elephant tusks was displayed, each weighing 73 kilograms. It is said that the largest tusks in Zaire are now in the United States, each weighing 117 kilograms. Elephants have such precious tusks, but this also brings them misfortune, making them the primary target of poachers. In recent years, the number of elephants in the park has significantly decreased. Due to strengthened protective measures, the number of elephants has started to recover. In the fight against poachers, 35 park guards have sacrificed their lives. Near the park entrance, there stands a white stone monument with the names of the martyrs engraved on it. All visitors passing by stop their cars and lay a small bouquet of flowers at the monument to pay their respects.

    野生动物的乐园
    ——扎伊尔维龙加国家公园记趣
    本报记者　杨汝生
    一天，记者从戈马市下飞机乘吉普车北上，车子在布满火山岩渣的道路上颠簸前进。穿过火山区，又进入了遮天蔽日的原始森林，愈往前走，人烟愈加稀少。当抵达维龙加公园内的尔万迪旅馆时，已是暮色朦胧了。
    “维龙加”在当地土语中是“偏远的山脉的意思”。公园始建于一九二五年，主要是为了保护珍稀的高山大猩猩。这座公园长三百公里，面积八十万公顷，经过了一九三○年和一九三五年两次扩建，才具现在的规模。这里的大自然得到最完整、最良好的保护，看不到人为的干扰和破坏。它的北部和西部是绵亘起伏的米通巴山脉，东部是碧波粼粼的阿明湖和高耸入云的鲁文佐里山，玛格丽特峰巅有罕见的“赤道雪”。南部是一片火山区，其中的尼拉贡戈火山一九八六年还喷发过。东南部还有鲁丘鲁河大瀑布。有人说，这块土地是“山和水巧夺天工的组合”，它荟萃了大自然的各种奇观。这里，还有上百种野生动物，有大猩猩、狮子、大象、河马、野牛、疣猪、鬣狗，等等。
    翌晨，公园的导游叫我们出去看狮子，他说有三头巨狮，就在旅馆旁边的草丛里。我们跟着导游走到那里时，只见狮子已往山谷的灌木林中走去。据导游说，公园里共有狮子五百多头，它们在夜里饱餐一顿之后，太阳一出来，便躲起来休息去了，所以不易见到。
    早晨是观看动物的最好时光，我们未吃早饭，便兴致勃勃地出发。在途中最先映入我们眼帘的是漫山遍野的羚羊，有的低头吃草，有的抬头四处张望，有的互相追逐嬉戏。在这一望无际的草原上，羚羊常常是猛兽的美味佳肴。据导游说，一头成狮每天要吃二十公斤肉，若按一头狮子每天捕食一只羚羊计，一年下来光被狮子吃掉的就有八万只。维龙加公园羚羊之多便可想而知了。
    据了解，维龙加公园的动物除有五百多头狮子外，还有两千头大象，三万只河马，一万五千头野牛，五千只疣猪，二百五十只大猩猩，河谷密林里还栖息着豹子。此外，还有不计其数的猴子和狒狒，它们经常拦截汽车，勒索食品，有时竟成群结队地跑到旅馆的院子里来，稍不留心，它们便会钻进汽车，或闯到屋里，弄个乱七八糟。维龙加公园的河马更是不计其数，它是世界上河马最为集中的地方，几乎每条河里都有。有一年河马竟将一条河道堵塞，至使河流上游泛滥成灾。
    凡来公园的人，若是见不到大象，将会感到莫大的遗憾。我们转了大半天，仍未见大象的影子，只好颓然而归。我们回到旅馆不久，导游来说发现了象群。我们忘却一天的疲劳，又兴致勃勃地出发了。当驱车来到一片坡地上时，看到一群大象正从河谷往山上缓缓走来。我数了一下，足有八十多头。非洲象比亚洲象个头大，力气壮，牙也长。在宾馆接待室里，陈列着一对大象牙，每根七十三公斤重。据说扎伊尔最大的象牙现在在美国，每根有一百一十七公斤。大象长了这么一对宝牙，也给自己带来杀身之祸，成了偷猎者捕杀的主要对象。前几年，公园的大象已明显减少，由于近年加强保卫措施，大象的数目才开始回升。在与偷猎者的斗争中，共有三十五名公园看守献出了宝贵的生命。在公园入口处不远的地方，矗立着一块洁白的石碑，上面镌刻着烈士们的名字，凡是经过那里的游人，都自觉地停下车子，在墓前献上一束小花，以示悼念。
