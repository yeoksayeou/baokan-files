	China has established 159 postdoctoral research stations.
	Xinhua News Agency reports that reporter Cao Huanrong reports: "China's postdoctoral research system will continue to develop." This was stated by Vice Minister of the Ministry of Personnel, Cheng Lianchang, at a recent symposium held by the Beijing Postdoctoral Association.

	China first established postdoctoral research stations in 1986. So far, there are 159 stations nationwide, distributed in 93 scientific research institutions and key universities in Beijing, Shanghai, Hefei, Changchun, and other places. There are 469 postdoctoral researchers currently in the stations, and 93 have completed their terms. About half of them are recent returnees from studying abroad.

	In his speech, Cheng Lianchang affirmed the achievements of the postdoctoral researchers, stating that they are playing a leading role in scientific research and economic construction. He said that we should summarize the experience and continue to run the postdoctoral research stations well. We welcome outstanding doctoral graduates who have obtained degrees abroad to return to China and work in the stations. To this end, the state has taken a series of flexible measures, such as allowing them to choose non-stationed units with conditions to do postdoctoral work and enjoy the same treatment.

    我国已建博士后流动站159个
    本报讯　记者曹焕荣报道：“我国的博士后研究制度将继续发展。”这是人事部副部长程连昌日前在北京博士后联谊会举行的一次座谈会上说的。
    我国于1986年首次设博士后流动站。到目前为止，全国已设站159个，分布在北京、上海、合肥、长春等地的93个科研单位和重点高校；在站博士后为469名，出站93名，他们中的半数左右，是近年从国外留学回国的。
    程连昌在发言中肯定了博士后的成绩，认为他们正在科学研究和经济建设中起尖兵作用。他说，我们要总结经验，继续办好博士后流动站。欢迎在国外获得学位的优秀博士生回国进站工作。为此，国家采取了一系列灵活措施，比如，可允许他们选择具备条件的非设站单位做博士后，享受同等待遇。
