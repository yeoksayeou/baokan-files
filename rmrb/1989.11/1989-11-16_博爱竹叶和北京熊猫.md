Yueshan is a small railway station in Bo'ai County, Henan Province. Every Tuesday and Saturday, about a dozen packages of bamboo leaves are sent from here on the passing 190th express train to Beijing. Upon arrival, the bamboo leaves are promptly delivered to the Beijing Zoo by waiting vehicles. The bamboo leaves from Bo'ai are a delicacy for the Beijing pandas.

The reporter asked officials from Bo'ai County, "Why do the Beijing pandas particularly favor Bo'ai bamboo leaves?" They explained, "Southern regions are too far away, and northern regions have too little bamboo. Bo'ai County, located north of the Yellow River and south of the Taihang Mountains, is the northern limit for bamboo cultivation. Further north, bamboo forests have little economic value and are mainly for ornamental purposes. Bo'ai's 17,000 mu of bamboo forest is currently an oasis in North China. The bamboo varieties include variegated bamboo, moso bamboo, sweet bamboo, variable bamboo, and Buddha's hand bamboo. Pandas particularly love the leaves of variegated bamboo and moso bamboo. It is said that these bamboo leaves are 'oily,' and after eating them, the pandas' fur becomes shiny. The county has designated Xiaoshuimo Village to specifically collect variegated bamboo and moso bamboo leaves for supply to Beijing."

The reporter asked, "Is this also a source of economic income for Bo'ai?" The county leaders said, "If we count the income, Bo'ai County produces over 10 million kilograms of raw bamboo annually, over 20 million bamboo products, with a total output value of over 20 million yuan. As for the bamboo leaves supplied to the Beijing pandas, they are only worth about 2 jiao per kilogram. Collecting and transporting the bamboo leaves is quite troublesome, and we do this not for profit, but to protect the national treasure. Of course, the Beijing Zoo is also very friendly. If you go there and declare yourself as a Bo'ai resident, you can visit the panda house for free."

    博爱竹叶和北京熊猫
    本报记者  李德民
    月山是河南省博爱县的一个小火车站，每逢星期二和星期六，有十几包竹叶从这里送上过境的190次快车发往北京。竹叶到京后，被接站的汽车及时送到北京动物园，博爱竹叶是北京熊猫的美餐。
    记者问博爱县的同志：“为什么北京熊猫偏爱博爱竹叶呢？”他们说，南方太远，北方太少，地处黄河以北、太行山之南的博爱县，是由南往北栽培竹林的“极限”地带，再往北去，竹林就很少有经济价值而只有观赏价值了，博爱的1.7万亩竹林是目前华北的一块绿洲，竹种有斑竹、筠竹、甜竹、变竹、罗汉竹等，熊猫最爱吃的是斑竹和筠竹叶子。据说这竹叶“油性大”，熊猫吃后毛色鲜亮。县里指定下水磨村专门负责采集斑竹和筠竹竹叶，供应北京。
    记者问：“这也算博爱的一笔经济收入吧？”博爱县的领导同志说，要算收入，博爱县年产原竹一千多万公斤，竹制品两千多万件，产值两千多万元。至于供应北京熊猫吃的竹叶，不过两毛来钱一斤，采竹叶、运竹叶麻烦还不少，做这件事确实不是为了赚钱，为的是保护国宝。当然人家北京动物园也很够朋友，不信你去试试，只要声明自己是博爱人士，熊猫馆免费参观。
