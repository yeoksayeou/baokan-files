A Special Friendship: True Friends

By reporters Shi Zongxing and Ren Yujun

November 14, 1989, was another significant day in the history of New China's diplomacy. At 10 a.m., Premier Li Peng boarded a special aircraft and flew westward along the "Silk Road," with Pakistan as his first stop, beginning a three-country tour of South Asia. Following China's decisive victory in suppressing the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, this was the first overseas visit by a Chinese leader. It will demonstrate to the world that China will continue to adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy; it is willing to develop friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; and strengthening unity and cooperation with Third World countries remains the cornerstone of China's foreign policy.

After approximately four and a half hours, the aircraft flew over the "Roof of the World." Looking out the window, the Karakoram Mountains, which stretch across the China-Pakistan border, are majestic and awe-inspiring; the peaks covered with millennia of snow glisten under the sunlight. However, even such a great mountain range has not separated the peoples of China and Pakistan. Instead, it serves as an indestructible bond, firmly connecting the peoples of the two countries.

The aircraft flew over the Red Mountain Pass and continued for another half hour before landing smoothly at Islamabad Airport. It was noon here, with warm sunshine and a gentle breeze, adding to the festive atmosphere and making the guests from early winter Beijing feel warm and cozy. Tens of thousands of people waved flags and bouquets, shouting "Long live Sino-Pakistani friendship" from the bottom of their hearts, expressing their fiery enthusiasm to Premier Li Peng and his entourage. For many years, people have used the most beautiful language to praise the deep friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan. However, when you are present, you will find that such friendship cannot be described in words.

Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was particularly happy today, standing smilingly by the aircraft stairs to welcome Premier Li Peng, who was stepping onto the land of the "Land of the Pure" for the first time. The two exchanged cordial greetings. In the past nine months, this was the second time the prime ministers of China and Pakistan had met. This fact alone is enough to show that as the new generation of government leaders of China and Pakistan, Li Peng and Benazir Bhutto are adding bricks and tiles to the edifice of Sino-Pakistani friendship. Benazir Bhutto took office as Prime Minister of Pakistan last December, and her first overseas visit in February was to China. She solemnly announced in Beijing that friendship with China "will remain the cornerstone of Pakistan's foreign policy." She also told the Chinese leadership: "In Pakistan, the torch of Sino-Pakistani friendship has been passed to the next generation, who will surely carry forward Sino-Pakistani friendship and pass the torch to the next generation." Premier Li Peng then clearly told her: "The Chinese government and people will always be a reliable friend of the Pakistani people."

It is against this background that Premier Li Peng's visit has been given special attention by the local media. Today's issue of Pakistani newspapers all reported Li Peng's visit as major news, publishing his photo, and believing that Li Peng's visit will further consolidate and develop the traditional friendship between the two countries.

The relationship between China and Pakistan is a special one, and the peoples of the two countries are true friends. The test of time and the trials of storms have made Sino-Pakistani friendship continuously radiate new luster. Without going too far back, the facts of just the past few months provide convincing evidence. In early June this year, after the Chinese government took decisive measures to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, some in the international community launched an anti-China tide, attempting to exert political and economic pressure on China. In stark contrast to this extremely unwise attitude, the Pakistani government expressed full understanding of the Chinese government. In late June, Benazir Bhutto clearly told the Chinese ambassador in Islamabad: "Pakistan will always stand with China." When some countries suspended high-level official exchanges with China, the Chairman of the Senate, the Speaker of the National Assembly, the Prime Minister's Advisor, the Foreign Secretary, and the Deputy Chief of the Army Staff of Pakistan successively visited China. They clearly stated in Beijing: "Whether it is sunny or rainy, the peoples of Pakistan and China will stand together as true friends." All this once again embodies the strong vitality of Sino-Pakistani friendship. On this point, Premier Li Peng recently said in Beijing to a Pakistani friend with deep emotion: "Only in adversity can one tell the stalwart grass, and only in a long journey can one tell the strength of a horse. In China's moment of temporary difficulty, who is a true friend and who is a false friend becomes very clear."

Starting this afternoon, the prime ministers of China and Pakistan will hold talks to fully and deeply exchange views on further developing the friendly cooperation between the two countries and the international and regional situations of common concern. Premier Li Peng will also meet with many old friends here and make new friends. Whether they are guests from Beijing or hosts here, they all share a common belief: Premier Li Peng's visit will surely make the Sino-Pakistani friendship road over the Karakoram Mountains even wider and smoother.

### 特殊的友谊　真正的朋友

    特殊的友谊　真正的朋友
    本报记者　史宗星　任毓骏
    1989年11月14日，是新中国外交史上又一个重要的日子。上午10时，李鹏总理乘专机离京，沿着“丝绸之路”上空西行，以巴基斯坦为首访国，开始了南亚三国之行。在我国赢得制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的决定性胜利之后，这是我国领导人的首次出访。它将向全世界表明：我国将一如既往、始终不渝地奉行独立自主的和平外交政策；愿意在和平共处五项原则基础上同世界各国发展友好关系；加强同第三世界国家的团结与合作，仍是我国对外政策的基石。
    经过大约4个半小时，专机飞临“世界屋脊”上空。凭窗俯瞰，坐落在中巴边境地区的喀喇昆仑山脉连绵逶迤，气势壮观；那一座座覆盖着万年积雪的山峰，在阳光下放射出耀眼的光茫。然而，即使这样的一座大山，也没能把中巴两国人民隔开，相反，它像一条坚不可摧的纽带，把中巴两国人民牢固地联系在一起。
    专机掠过红其拉甫山口，继续飞行半个小时后，平稳地降落在伊斯兰堡机场。这里正值中午时分，阳光融融，微风习习，加上那喜气洋洋的节日气氛，使来自初冬北京的客人感到温馨。成千上万的人挥舞着彩旗和花束，以发自内心的“巴中友谊万岁”的欢呼，向李鹏总理一行表达了火一般的热情。多少年来，人们总用最美好的语言称颂中巴两国人民的深厚友谊，然而，当你亲临其境之时又会发现，这样的友谊不是用语言所能形容的。
    贝·布托总理今天格外高兴，笑盈盈地站在舷梯旁迎候第一次踏上“清真之国”土地的李鹏总理。两人互致亲切问候。在最近的9个月中，这是中巴两国总理第二次相逢。仅这个事实本身就足以表明，作为中巴两国继往开来的新一代政府首脑，李鹏和贝·布托正为中巴友谊大厦添砖增瓦。贝·布托去年12月出任巴基斯坦总理，今年2月首次出国访问就去了中国，她在北京郑重地宣布，同中国友好“仍将是巴基斯坦外交政策的基石”。她还对中国领导人说：“在巴基斯坦，巴中友谊的火炬已经交到下一代人手里，他们一定会把巴中友好发展下去，并把火炬交给再下一代人。”李鹏总理当时则向她明确表示：“中国政府和人民将永远是巴基斯坦人民可信赖的朋友。”
    正是在这样的背景下，李鹏总理这次来访受到此间舆论的格外重视。今天发行的巴基斯坦各报，都把李鹏总理来访作为重大新闻报道，刊登了李鹏的照片，认为李鹏总理的这次访问，将使两国的传统友谊进一步得到巩固和发展。
    中巴两国的关系是一种特殊关系，两国人民是真正的朋友。岁月的考验，风雨的洗礼，使中巴友谊不断地焕发出新的异彩。远的不说，仅最近几个月的事实就提供了令人信服的证据。今年6月初，中国政府采取果断措施平息北京发生的反革命暴乱后，国际上有人掀起反华逆流，试图在政治上、经济上向中国施加压力。与这种极不明智的态度截然不同，巴基斯坦政府对中国政府表示充分的理解。6月下旬，贝·布托在伊斯兰堡对中国大使明确表示：巴基斯坦永远和中国站在一起。当有的国家中止同中国的高级官方交往时，巴基斯坦的参议院主席、国民议会议长、总理顾问、外交秘书和陆军副参谋长等要员相继访问了中国，他们在北京明确表示：“不论晴天还是雨天，巴中两国人民都会作为真正的朋友站在一起。”所有这些，再次体现了中巴友谊的强大生命力。对于这一点，李鹏总理最近在北京会见一位巴基斯坦朋友时颇动感情地说道：疾风知劲草，路遥知马力。在中国遇到暂时困难的时刻，谁是真朋友，谁是假朋友，就看得很清楚了。
      从今天下午开始，中巴两国总理将举行会谈，就进一步发展两国的友好合作关系及
  共同关心的国际和地区形势等全面深入地交换看法。李鹏总理还将会见这里的许多老朋友，结识新朋友。不论是来自北京的客人，还是这里的主人，都抱有一个共同的信念：李鹏总理的这次访问，必将把越过喀喇昆仑山的中巴友谊之路开拓得更宽阔，更平坦。
