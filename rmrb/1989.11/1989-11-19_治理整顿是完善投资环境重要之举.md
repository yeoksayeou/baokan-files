The recent China Foreign Investment Enterprise Achievement Exhibition held in Beijing has attracted widespread attention and interest. It not only reflects the achievements of China's open policy but also demonstrates China's continued and better opening-up efforts.

Recently, some foreign-invested enterprises have reported that they have encountered more difficulties since the rectification and ordering campaign began. Some foreign friends who were planning to invest in China are also concerned that it will be very difficult to run a business during this period, and thus they are hesitating and observing.

What impact will the rectification and ordering campaign have on the operation of foreign-funded enterprises and China's investment environment? Is it beneficial or detrimental? This is indeed a question that needs to be clarified urgently.

It is undeniable that many enterprises, including foreign-funded ones, are currently facing more difficulties. However, objectively speaking, these difficulties, although appearing now, have their roots in the previous few years, stemming from the overheated economy of recent years. The rectification of the economic environment and the ordering of economic order are an important adjustment China is undertaking to overcome some problems caused by the overheated economy. Its purpose is to create conditions for the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy. Fundamentally, this is beneficial to all types of enterprises, including foreign-funded ones.

Some specific goals of the rectification and ordering campaign are actually aimed at further improving the investment environment.

For example, adjusting the industrial structure and clarifying the priority order of industrial development will guide foreign investment. In the past few years, due to an irrational industrial structure and unclear industrial policies, there has been some blindness in foreign investment and domestic approval work. With the changes in the domestic market, foreign-funded enterprises in categories such as cosmetics, beverages, and household appliances, which were initially thought to be profitable, have encountered the problem of product stagnation. This lesson precisely shows that optimizing the industrial structure is a prerequisite for optimizing foreign investment direction and ensuring the profitability of foreign-funded enterprises, and it can no longer be delayed.

For example, controlling the overly fast economic speed to keep it within a reasonable range is also beneficial for the development of foreign-funded enterprises. The long-standing "old difficult problems" such as power shortages, difficulties in raw material supply, and tight transportation will be alleviated.

For example, during the rectification and ordering campaign, the state has strengthened control over reinvestment, actually creating investment opportunities for foreigners. Some projects and industries are indeed urgently needed by the state for development, and due to limited domestic financial resources, foreign investment is urgently needed to supplement them. For these projects and industries, the state will provide more preferential conditions to encourage investors.

For example, controlling inflation will help improve the feasibility and reliability of investment analysis and economic analysis; rectifying and ordering companies and cracking down on corruption will help foreign investors find more qualified partners in China, improve efficiency, and so on.

It should be said that after 10 years of efforts, China's investment environment has been continuously improving. China has successively promulgated more than 200 foreign economic laws and regulations, signed investment protection agreements with 24 countries, and signed double taxation avoidance agreements with 22 countries. In the vast economic special zones, coastal cities, economic and technological development zones, and the three deltas, the necessary infrastructure and living service facilities for foreign investment have been built and improved. Various levels of government have established departments in charge of foreign investment, and some places have established various institutions specifically for foreign investment services.

The efforts of the Chinese government have achieved obvious results. By the end of September this year, more than 20,000 foreign investment projects have been approved nationwide, with a total agreed foreign investment amount of over 32 billion US dollars. Although there were partial disturbances and counter-revolutionary riots in the spring and summer, none of the more than 8,000 foreign-funded enterprises that have already started operations have terminated their contracts due to this. During the rectification and ordering process, more than 85% of foreign-funded enterprises are operating normally, and an average of over 400 new foreign-funded enterprises are approved each month nationwide in July, August, and September.

The recent Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Party once again reiterated that China's open policy will not change, and foreign investment in China is encouraged. We believe that the rectification and ordering campaign will not only bring a bright future to China's construction and reform but will also bring more and better opportunities to foreign investors.

    治理整顿是完善投资环境重要之举
    本报评论员
    刚刚在北京闭幕的中国外商投资企业成果展览会，引起了人们广泛的注意和兴趣。它既从一个侧面反映了我国开放政策的实绩，也表明了我国继续开放、更好开放的势头。
    近来也有一些外商投资企业反映，治理整顿以来，企业碰到的困难增多；一些准备来华投资的外国朋友也担心，在治理整顿期间，办企业会非常艰难，因而徘徊观望。
    治理整顿对外资企业的经营，对中国的投资环境，究竟会产生什么影响？是有利还是不利？这不能不说是一个亟待澄清的问题。
    不可否认，不少企业，包括外资企业，目前确实遇到较多困难。但是平心而论，这些困难，看似发生在眼前，根源却在前几年，是几年来经济过热酿成的。治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，正是中国为了克服经济过热带来的一些问题而进行的一次重要的调整，它的目的在于创造国民经济持续、稳定、协调发展的条件。从根本上讲，这对各种经济成份的企业，包括外资企业都是有利的。
    治理整顿的一些具体目标，实际上正是对投资环境的进一步改善。
    譬如调整产业结构，明确产业优先发展顺序，将有利于外商投资的导向。前几年，由于产业结构不够合理，产业政策不够明确，导致了外商投资和国内审批工作的某些盲目性。随着国内市场的变化，当初认为来钱快的化妆品、饮料、家用电器等生活消费品类的外资企业，遇到了产品滞销的问题。这一教训恰恰说明，优化产业结构，实在是优化外资投向，确保外资企业盈利的前提条件，再也拖延不得了。
    譬如控制过快的经济速度，使之保持在一个合理的范围内，对外资企业的发展也是有利的。叫了多年的电力不足、原材料供应困难、交通运输紧张等“老大难”问题，将会得到缓解。
    譬如治理整顿中，国家加强了对再投资的控制，实际为外商创造了投资机会。有些项目，有些行业，确是国家急需发展的，由于国内财力有限，迫切需要外资补充。对这些项目和这些行业，国家将给予更为优惠的条件，以鼓励投资者。
    譬如控制通货膨胀，有助于提高投资分析和经济分析的可行性和牢靠程度；治理整顿公司，惩治腐败现象，将有利于外国投资者在中国找到更具资格的合作伙伴，提高办事效率，如此等等。
    应该说，经过10年的努力，我国的投资环境日益改善。我国先后颁布了200多项涉外经济法律和法规，同24个国家签订了投资保护协定，同22个国家签订了避免双重税收的协定，在地域广阔的经济特区、沿海城市、经济技术开发区和三个三角洲地带，建设和完善了外商投资所必需的各项基础设施和生活服务设施，各级政府设立了主管外商投资的机关，一些地方成立了专为外商投资服务的各种机构。
    我国政府的这些努力，收到了明显的成效。截至今年9月底，全国批准外商投资项目超过2万个，协议外资金额达到320多亿美元。尽管春夏之交发生了局部动乱和反革命暴乱，但是已经开业的8000多家外资企业，没有一家因此而中止合同。在治理整顿过程中，85％以上的外资企业经营情况正常，七、八、九三个月，全国平均每个月新批准外资企业达400余家。
    最近召开的党的十三届五中全会，再次重申我国对外开放政策不变，鼓励外商来华投资。我们相信，治理整顿不仅会给中国的建设和改革带来光明前景，也会给外国投资者带来更多更好的机会。
