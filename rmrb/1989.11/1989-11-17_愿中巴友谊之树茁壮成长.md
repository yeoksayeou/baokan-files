The current Islamabad is bathed in bright sunlight with pleasant weather. The most enchanting spot in Islamabad is the hilltop park. The park is lush with pine and cypress trees, green grass, and various precious flowers such as roses, jasmine, and hibiscus blooming in full glory. Standing on the observation deck at the hilltop, one can take in the entire beautiful scenery of Islamabad. It is here on this hilltop that the Pakistani government has designated a plot of land for visiting leaders from various countries to plant friendship trees as a memento.

At 10:30 AM today, Premier Li, accompanied by Mr. Asif Ali Zardari, husband of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, arrived at the hilltop park. The Chairman of the Capital Development Authority, Hussein, pointed to a tree and told Premier Li, "This is the tree planted by the respected Premier Zhou Enlai." Premier Li, looking at the marble plaque in front of the tree, softly said, "Oh, February 21, 1964, 25 years have passed."

On February 21, 1964, Premier Zhou Enlai was the first to plant a friendship tree in this plot. Today, this tree has grown tall and sturdy with lush branches and leaves.

Premier Li stood by the tree, observing it closely. The autumn season had turned many of the leaves a reddish-purple, adding to its charm. The Chinese and Pakistani friends present also gazed at the tree with deep affection, their faces showing respect and remembrance for Premier Zhou.

Then, Premier Li strolled through the "Friendship Grove," observing the friendship trees planted by Chinese leaders such as Liu Shaoqi and Li Xiannian, as well as those planted by leaders from other countries. When Premier Li reached the spot designated for him to plant a tree, the television and photographic reporters present began to busy themselves.

Premier Li and Chairman Hussein together placed a two-foot-tall magnolia tree into the pit, creating another historic moment.

After Premier Li shoveled two spades of soil, he said to his wife, Mrs. Zhu Lin, "You should do a couple of shovelfuls too." Mrs. Zhu Lin took the shovel and filled the rest of the soil into the pit.

Then, Premier Li picked up a watering can and humorously said, "Let's give it a bath." Before he finished speaking, laughter erupted. The clear water splashed out, washing the tree's green leaves clean, making it look even more vibrant. Minister of Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen, Minister of the State Council Office of Foreign Affairs Zheng Tuobin, and Vice Minister He Qizong also watered the tree. When it was time for China's Ambassador to Pakistan, Tian Ding, to water the tree, Premier Li said to him, "You should come and water it once a year."

Hussein pointed to the small tree and told Premier Li that this magnolia tree would bloom in 5 to 7 years, with large, beautiful white flowers tinged with yellow.

Before leaving the park, Premier Li wrote in the park's guestbook: "May the tree of Sino-Pakistani friendship thrive."

   “愿中巴友谊之树茁壮成长”
    本报记者  史宗星  任毓骏
    时下的伊斯兰堡，阳光明丽、气候宜人。伊斯兰堡景色最迷人的地方当属山顶公园。园内松苍柏翠，绿草如茵，玫瑰、茉莉和蔷薇等各种名贵花卉竞相开放。站在山顶的观景台上，伊斯兰堡的秀丽风光尽收眼底。就在这个山顶上，巴基斯坦政府辟出一块园地，专请来访的各国领导人栽植友谊树留作纪念。
    今天上午10点半，李总理由贝·布托的丈夫阿西夫·阿里·扎尔达里先生陪同，来到山顶公园。首都发展局主席侯赛因指着一株乌桕树告诉李总理：“这是尊敬的周恩来先生栽的。”李总理看着树前的大理石牌轻声自语：“噢，1964年2月21日，25年了。”
    1964年2月21日，周恩来总理第一个在这片园地植下一棵友谊树。如今这棵树已经长得树干挺拔、枝繁叶茂了。
    李总理在乌桕树前驻足细观。深秋时节把许多绿叶染上了紫红，更增加了它的风采。在场的中巴两国朋友也都深情地望着这棵树，脸上流露出对周总理的敬仰和怀念之情。
    然后，李总理在“友谊林”漫步，依次观看了刘少奇、李先念等中国领导人和其它国家领导人栽下的友谊树。当李总理来到主人为他安排的植树地点后，在场的电视和摄影记者纷纷忙碌起来。
    李总理和侯赛因主席一起将一棵2尺多高的木兰树放进树坑，成为又一个历史性的镜头。
    李总理培了两锹土后，便对他的夫人朱琳说：“你也来两下。”朱琳接过铁锹，把剩下的土全部填进了树坑。
    接着，李总理提起喷水壶并幽默地说：“给它洗个澡。”话音没落，就响起一阵笑声。哗哗洒出的清水把小树的片片绿叶洗得干干净净，更显得朝气蓬勃。钱其琛外长、郑拓彬部长、何其宗副总长也为小树浇了水。轮到中国驻巴基斯坦大使田丁浇水时，李总理对他说：“你们每年都来浇一次水。”
    侯赛因指着小树对李总理说，这棵木兰树，再过5到7年便可开花，花朵硕大，白里透黄，十分美丽。
    李总理离开公园前在公园的留言簿上题辞：“愿中巴友谊之树茁壮成长。”
