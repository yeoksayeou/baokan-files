Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 24th.

State Councilor Zhou Jiahua today inspected the application of new water-coal slurry technology at the Beijing Paper Mill No. 1.

Accompanied by Beijing Vice Mayor Wu Yi, Zhou Jiahua carefully examined the various facilities of the water-coal slurry project at the Beijing Paper Mill No. 1. He also spoke with workers in front of the boiler, inquiring about the use of water-coal slurry.

He said, considering our national conditions, first, we cannot continue to burn oil; we must reduce oil consumption as much as possible. Second, burning coal requires solving the transportation problem. Currently, to generate 80 to 100 million kilowatts of electricity annually, 24 million tons of coal are needed, and 40% of the national railway's transport capacity is used for coal. Now it seems that using water-coal slurry technology can be a solution to the transport issue. After analyzing the domestic and international research and application status of water-coal slurry technology, Zhou Jiahua said that this technology has matured and can be considered for industrial-scale promotion and application in China.

Water-coal slurry is a new type of coal-to-oil fuel developed internationally in the 1970s. It is composed of coal powder, water, and additives, and compared to coal, it has the advantages of being easily adjustable, low-polluting, high-efficiency, easy to store and transport, and easy to burn. It also has the fluidity and stability of oil. China listed it as a key research and development project in the early 1980s, achieving breakthrough progress. Recently, the State Council approved the inclusion of water-coal slurry and its products in the list of national key supported development products.

　　新型燃料水煤浆技术已成熟
　　邹家华说可考虑工业化推广应用
    据新华社北京11月24日电　（记者杨青）国务委员邹家华今天到北京造纸一厂视察水煤浆新技术的应用情况。
    邹家华在北京市副市长吴仪陪同下，仔细察看了北京造纸一厂水煤浆工程的各种设施，并在锅炉前与工人交谈，询问水煤浆的燃用情况。
    他说，根据我们的国情，第一不能再烧油了，要尽量减少油的消耗；第二，烧煤需要解决运输问题，现在每年增发800—1000万千瓦的电就需煤炭2400万吨，全国铁路运力的40％都在运煤。现在看来运用水煤浆技术可以作为解决运力的一种。邹家华分析了国内外水煤浆技术的研究应用状况后说，这项技术已经成熟，在国内可以考虑工业化的推广应用。
    水煤浆是国际上70年代发展起来的一种新型以煤代油的燃料，由煤粉、水、添加剂配比组成，它与煤炭相比具有易调整、低污染、高效率、易贮运、易燃等优点，又具有了石油那种流动性和稳定性。我国80年代初把它列为重点科研攻关项目，取得突破性进展。最近国务院又批准将水煤浆及制品列入国家重点支持发展产品。
