In the minds of most people, an exchange is the most chaotic place. Therefore, people often describe a chaotic office as being "as chaotic as an exchange." However, when I braved the drizzling rain to arrive at 11 Wall Street, New York, passed through the security check, and entered the New York Stock Exchange, I realized that my previous impressions were too superficial.

After listening to the exchange manager's introduction and observing the trading floor from the stands, we came to a very quiet place in the exchange, known as the "Market Surveillance Department." I call it the "eyes of the exchange," which seems quite appropriate. The head of the department answered a series of questions that arose in our minds during our tour of the exchange.

	Client (甲): What are the procedures for joining the exchange?
	Host (乙): The exchange is a private company with 1,500 members, each paying an annual fee of $700,000. New members can only obtain membership by purchasing seats from retiring members. Of course, there are also those who rent out their seats.

	Client: How are trades conducted?
	Host: The exchange has 196 trading posts. Trades must be conducted through brokers and in the presence of specialists. Each trade incurs a certain fee. Orders can also be received from across the country through electronic and telephone systems.

	Client: How does the government regulate you?
	Host: The federal government's Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress regulate us through various regulations and investigations. We follow the law. To maintain our credibility, we must regulate ourselves and prevent illegal activities.

	Client: Please provide more details.
	Host: The surveillance department is the place that truly knows the market's activities in real-time. We have 20 on-site observers who monitor the situation in the trading floor; and 20 off-site observers who monitor through electronic computer systems. The main focus is on observing transaction prices, volumes, and stock index fluctuations. If any unusual situation is detected, we have the authority to suspend trading. On average, about 3 to 7 stocks experience such situations daily, and trading is usually resumed after a half-hour suspension. The buy and sell prices are announced in advance when resuming trading.

	Purpose of surveillance: To check if there are insiders trading with prior knowledge to make huge profits; to check if the participating companies are engaged in abnormal activities; to check if someone is manipulating the trading market.

	Client: What is the role of electronic computers?
	Host: Off-site observers use electronic computers to track the transaction amounts and prices of company stocks over a month. By comparing the numbers, they can determine if the trading is normal. The computer stores information on 500,000 to 1 million people, allowing past stock transactions to be checked at any time.

	Client: If an abnormal trading situation is discovered, what happens next?
	Host: Discovering an abnormal situation does not necessarily mean there is abnormal trading. Further investigation and analysis are required. If we cannot determine the cause, we will ask the company to provide an explanation. Then, we will handle the situation accordingly based on the specifics.

	Client: How effective is the surveillance?
	Host: It is impossible to completely prevent abnormal trading. As the saying goes, "There are many criminals, and the police cannot prevent them all." The pursuit of profit is the motive, and some people will always take risks.

　　纽约证券交易所的“眼睛”
　　年文
    在一般人看来，交易所是最乱的地方。因此，人们往往形容某办公室“乱得像个交易所”。但是，当我冒着蒙蒙细雨来到纽约华尔街十一号，通过安全检查门，进入纽约证券交易所时，我意识到往日的印象太表面化了。
    听罢交易所负责人的情况介绍，在看台上观看过交易所的营业现场后，我们来到交易所一处极静的地方，名为“市场监督处”。我称其为“交易所的眼睛”，似无不妥。监督处的负责人在这里回答了我们参观交易所时脑海里涌现出的一大串问题。
    甲（客）：请问加入交易所要什么手续？
    乙（主）：交易所是私人公司，有会员一千五百人，每人每年要交会费七十万美元。新成员只有从退出的老会员中买得席位方可取得成员资格。当然也有把位置租出去的。
    甲：怎样进行交易呢？
    乙：交易所有一百九十六个交易点。交易必须通过经纪人并在专家面前成交。每次交易，要收一定手续费。也可通过电子、电话系统接受全国各地订单。
    甲：政府如何管理你们呢？
    乙：联邦政府证券交易委员会和国会都管我们，通过各种条例和调查实行管理。我们遵循法律。交易所要维持信誉，就要自己管好自己，防止违法行为。
    甲：请详细介绍一下。
    乙：监督处是真正能马上知道市场活动情况的地方。我们有线上观察员二十名，在交易现场了解情况；有线外观察员二十名，通过电子计算机系统进行监督。监督主要察看成交价格、数量和股票指数波动情况。如发现特殊情况，有权停止交易。平均每天约有三至七种股票出现上述情况，通常停止半小时后再恢复交易。恢复时事先公布买卖价格。
    监督目的：看是否有事先知道情报的人，进行内线交易，牟取暴利；看参与交易的公司是否进行不正常活动；看是否有人操纵交易市场。
    甲：电子计算机的作用呢？
    乙：线外观察员利用电子计算机通过一个月时间追踪公司股票成交数额和价格，通过对比数看交易是否正常。计算机中储存有五十至一百万人的名字和材料，可随时查过去股票买卖情况。
  甲：发现交易不正常情况，就…… 　乙：发现不正常情况，不一定表示不正常交易。要继续调查，分析原因。如果我们不能确定原因，就让那个公司作出解释。然后根据具体情况分别处理。
    甲：监督效果如何呢？
    乙：要完全防止不正常交易做不到。正所谓：犯罪人多，警察防不胜防。追求利润是动机，有人总要铤而走险。
