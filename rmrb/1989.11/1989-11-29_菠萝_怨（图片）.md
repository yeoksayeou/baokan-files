Title: The Grievance of the "Pineapple"

The pineapple in the picture is intricately crafted and lifelike, qualifying as a piece of handcrafted art. However, it is made by folding and assembling hundreds of brand-new one-fen notes. This phenomenon of using new banknotes to fold and decorate pineapples is becoming increasingly common in our area. Some households fold one or two for display, while some shops fold three or four to place in their shop windows to attract customers. Given the current situation where the country's paper currency is in short supply and the regulation of the market's monetary circulation structure is not yet guaranteed, how can we allow the arbitrary alteration of the use of banknotes! Fellow villagers, please consciously cherish the banknotes.

　　“菠萝”怨
    图中这个“菠萝”制作精巧，栩栩如生，称得上手工艺作品。可这竟是用几百张崭新的人民币一分纸币折拼而成的。这种用新纸币折拼装饰菠萝的现象，在我们这里越来越普遍。有的家庭折一两个做摆设，有的商店折三四个放在橱窗里招揽顾客。在当前国家纸币紧张、调节市场货币流通结构尚不能保证的情况下，岂容随意改变人民币的用途！乡亲们，请自觉爱护人民币。
