Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, November 23rd

Soviet Defense Minister Yazov said tonight at a press conference here that Soviet troops stationed in Czechoslovakia will not intervene in any potential internal conflicts.

Yazov arrived in Austria on November 20th at the invitation of Austrian Defense Minister Lichard and was concluding his official visit to Austria before departing for his home country. He held the press conference.

He said that the "democratization process" occurring in Eastern European countries is their internal affairs, and the Soviet Union will not interfere. However, he emphasized that Eastern European countries must uphold their obligations to the Warsaw Pact, which is unchangeable.

When discussing Austria's application to join the European Community, Yazov pointed out that since Austria signed the "State Treaty" in May 1955, which stipulates that Austria will remain permanently neutral and will not form any alliance with Germany, the Soviet Union believes that Austria cannot join the European Community. Otherwise, it would no longer be able to continue as a neutral country.

### 苏联国防部长说　驻捷苏军将不介入捷内部事务

　　苏联国防部长说
　　驻捷苏军将不介入捷内部事务
    新华社维也纳11月23日电　苏联国防部长亚佐夫今天晚上在这里的记者招待会上说，苏联驻军将不介入捷克斯洛伐克内部可能发生的冲突。
    亚佐夫是应奥地利国防部长利哈尔的邀请于20日来到奥地利进行正式访问的。
    他在结束访问奥地利起程回国前举行的记者招待会上说，东欧国家出现的“民主化进程”是这些国家的内政，苏联不去干涉。但他同时强调，东欧各国都必须坚持它们对华约所承担的义务，这是不能改变的。
    在谈到奥地利申请加入欧共体的问题时，亚佐夫指出，由于奥地利在1955年5月签署了规定奥地利永久中立、并不得同德国结成任何形式的联盟的“国家条约”，所以苏联认为奥地利不能加入欧共体，因为这样一来它就无法继续成为一个中立国。
