Two measurement ships achieve over 100 results in a decade, measurement precision reaches world advanced level, Central Military Commission awards collective first-class merit to Far Horizon 1 and 2

	Nanjing, November 21 (Xinhua) — The strategic weapon and aerospace flight sea-based measurement and control vanguard forces of our country — Far Horizon 1 and 2 measurement ships — have both been awarded the collective first-class merit.

	Yesterday, the director of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, Major General Ding Henggao, read out the order issued by the Central Military Commission at the Far Ocean Aerospace Measurement Base, commending all the officers and soldiers for their outstanding contributions to the development of our country's aerospace industry and the modernization of national defense.

	The "Far Horizon" sister ships are the first-generation comprehensive far-ocean aerospace measurement ships built by our country through its own efforts in 1978. Since 1980, they have embarked on seven expeditions to the Pacific Ocean and participated in nine national-level large-scale experiments, including the launch of long-range carrier rockets, underwater launches of carrier rockets by nuclear submarines, and the launch of practical communication satellites. In every instance, they have successfully completed their sea-based measurement and control missions.

	Over the past decade, the officers and soldiers of the "Far Horizon" sister ships have diligently studied and explored ways to improve sea-based measurement precision, bringing our country's sea-based measurement precision to the world's advanced level. During the underwater launch of carrier rockets by nuclear submarines last year, they adopted numerous measures to improve the precision of the measured warhead landing point by five times, setting a new record for real-time prediction of landing point precision. During the launch of our country's fourth practical communication satellite, they boldly applied a new orbit determination program, improving the real-time orbit determination precision during the satellite's entry into orbit by an order of magnitude. The error in the semi-major axis of the transfer orbit was only a few kilometers, significantly lower than the overall plan's requirement of tens of kilometers.

	While completing high-quality sea-based measurement and control tasks, the officers and soldiers of the "Far Horizon" sister ships have pooled their wisdom to carry out technological transformation and innovation activities. They have achieved over 100 scientific research results that have won national and ministerial-level science and technology awards. They have also effectively solved the four major technical challenges in far-ocean aerospace measurement today: stable tracking, positioning, calibration, and anti-interference. This marks a significant improvement in the comprehensive measurement and control capabilities of our country's aerospace measurement ships.

　　两测量船十年获百项成果
　　测量精度达世界先进水平
　　中央军委颁令为远望一号二号记集体一等功
    本报南京11月21日电　我国战略武器和航天飞行试验海上测控尖兵力量——远望1号、2号测量船双双荣立集体一等功。
    昨天，国防科工委主任丁衡高中将在远洋航天测量基地，宣读了由中央军委颁发的命令，嘉奖全体官兵为我国航天事业发展和国防现代化建设立下的汗马功劳。
    “远望号”姐妹船是我国依靠自己的力量于1978年建成下水的第一代综合性远洋航天测量船。1980年以来，先后7次远征太平洋，9次参加我国远程运载火箭发射、核潜艇水下发射运载火箭、实用通信卫星发射等国家级大型试验，无论哪一次，都圆满完成了海上测控任务。
    10年来，“远望号”姐妹船的官兵悉心研究探索，下功夫提高海上测量精度，使我国海上测量精度已达到世界先进水平。去年核潜艇水下发射运载火箭时，他们采取许多措施，使测得的弹头落点精度比过去提高了5倍，创造了实时预报落点精度的最高纪录。我国发射第四颗实用通信卫星时，他们大胆运用新的定轨程序，使卫星入轨段实时定轨精度提高了一个数量级，转移轨道长半轴误差仅几公里，大大低于总体方案规定的几十公里的误差要求。
    “远望号”姐妹船的官兵在高质量地完成海上测控任务的同时，群策群力开展技术改造和技术革新活动，先后有100多项科研成果获得国家部级科技成果奖，并较好地解决了当今世界远洋航天测量中稳定跟踪、定位、标校、抗干扰4大技术难题，标志着我国航天测量船的综合测控能力提高到了新的水平。
