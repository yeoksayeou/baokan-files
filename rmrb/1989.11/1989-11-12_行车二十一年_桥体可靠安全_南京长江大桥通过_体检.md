Nanjing residents have seen the bridge year after year, but on November 9th, they had a rare opportunity to see something extraordinary: sixty-six heavily loaded trucks lined up and started and stopped simultaneously on the bridge, while two trains ran side by side in the middle of the bridge. This was actually a comprehensive "check-up" conducted by railway and bridge experts for the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.

The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is a "pride bridge" designed and manufactured by China itself, which was officially opened to traffic at the end of 1968. The total length of the railway on the bridge is 6,772 meters, and the length of the road is 4,588 meters, making it the longest combined road and railway bridge in China. Currently, the railway bridge handles up to 200 train trips per day, and the road bridge accommodates nearly 25,000 vehicles daily, which is three times the initial traffic volume when it first opened. Over the past twenty-one years, it has generated economic benefits exceeding 24 billion yuan.

Time has passed, and the bridge has endured nearly a hundred typhoons and several dozen floods, as well as a few collisions with ships weighing around a thousand tons. How reliable is it now? The Ministry of Railways commissioned the Nanjing Railway Bureau to conduct the first comprehensive inspection of the bridge. Starting from October 16th, the inspection included fifteen projects, divided into static and dynamic load tests, conducted every other day for a total of twenty-three days. This was the most comprehensive inspection of a major bridge in China to date.

Through the comprehensive inspection, experts concluded that, except for some minor damage to the road surface, the bridge piers, bridge structures, and railway surface showed no abnormal displacement, vibration, stress, steel beam deflection, or excessive impact. The overall safety and reliability of the bridge are consistent with its initial technical parameters when it first opened to traffic.

    行车二十一年  桥体可靠安全
    南京长江大桥通过“体检”
    本报南京电　南京的市民年年岁岁看大桥，但都没有像十一月九日那天大饱眼福：六十六辆重载卡车列队在桥面同时启停，桥中两列火车齐头并进。原来，这是铁道桥梁专家在为南京长江大桥作首次全面“体检”。
    南京长江大桥是我国自行设计、制造的“志气桥”，于一九六八年底正式通车。全桥铁路长度为六千七百七十二米，公路长度为四千五百八十八米，是我国最长的公、铁路两用桥。目前，铁路桥每天通过的列车达二百趟次，公路桥每天通过的各种客货机动车辆近二点五万辆次，是建成通车初期的三倍。二十一年来，创造经济效益达二十四亿元以上。
    物换星移廿一载。通车以来，南京长江大桥经历了近百余次台风袭击和数十次洪峰，以及几次千吨左右货轮的意外撞击。如今，它的安全可靠性如何？铁道部委托南京铁路分局对大桥进行首次全面检定试验。从十月十六日开始，隔日
  一次，包括静载或动载试验两类计十五个项目，历时二十三天。这是国内第一次项目最齐全的特大桥梁的检定试验。
    通过全面检定试验，专家们对这座大桥的现有技术状态得出结论：除公路桥面略有损坏外，桥墩、桥梁及铁路桥面均没有出现超限的位移、振动、不正常的应力、钢梁挠度及过量冲击现象，大桥整体的安全可靠性与通车初期的技术参数基本一致。
