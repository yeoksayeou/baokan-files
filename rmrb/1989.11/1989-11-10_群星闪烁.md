The 40 years from November 11, 1949, to the present, have seen the various branches of the People's Air Force shine like brilliant stars, guarding the skies of our motherland.

Since the 1960s, China has begun developing aviation weapons. Most of the aircraft currently in use by the Air Force are produced domestically. At present, the number of aircraft in the Chinese Air Force is 44 times that of the early days of its establishment, making China one of the countries with the largest number of aircraft in the world.

The Air Force's surface-to-air missile troops, known as the "sharp sword" of China, were established on August 6, 1958. Their first victory came on October 7, 1959, when they shot down an invading military aircraft, marking the failure of the imperialists' boasted "air superiority" and setting a precedent in the history of air defense by using surface-to-air missiles to shoot down invading military aircraft. In subsequent air defense operations, this force has shot down more than 10 U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, unmanned reconnaissance aircraft, and other military combat aircraft that invaded our airspace.

The Chinese Air Force's surface-to-air missile troops now have the capability to intercept both air and ground missiles and can carry out various types of air defense missions, such as protecting key areas, borders, and islands. With the continuous upgrading of weapons and equipment, China's surface-to-air missile troops will gradually develop into a force capable of high, medium, and low-altitude, long, medium, and short-range air defense operations with rapid response capabilities.

The Air Force Radar Corps was established in September 1949. It is a branch that uses radar to obtain air information. Since the early 1950s, when the first air surveillance and intelligence system centered on Shanghai was established, the Air Force Radar Corps has transitioned from visual surveillance to radar detection, from point deployment to forming a radar alert line, and from regional radar intelligence networks to a national radar intelligence network, basically covering the entire national airspace.

The Airborne Corps was established in September 1950. Over the past 40 years, this force has developed into a modernized corps composed of infantry, artillery, communications, engineers, and chemical defense troops. Coordinating with the army, navy, air force, local forces, and militia, they have conducted countless combat exercises of various types across the country.

    群星闪烁

    1949年11月11日至今的40年，人民空军的各兵种如璀璨的群星，守卫着祖国的领空。
    我国从60年代开始研制航空武器。空军现有的飞机，绝大部分是我国自己生产的。目前，我国空军的飞机数量相当于初建时期的44倍，是世界上拥有飞机数量较多的国家。
    被人们称之为“利剑”的中国空军地对空导弹部队，是1958年8月6日成立的。它首战告捷是在1959年10月7日，这次胜利宣告了帝国主义大肆吹嘘的“空中优势”破产，首创了世界防空史上用地对空导弹击落入侵军用飞机的战例。在以后的防空作战中，这支部队先后10余次击落入侵我领空的U—2高空间谍飞机、无人驾驶侦察机和其他军用作战飞机。
    中国空军地对空导弹部队，现在已具有对空对地导弹拦截的能力，可以完成要地、边境、海岛等不同类型的防空作战任务。随着武器装备的不断更新，我国地对空导弹部队将逐步发展成为具有高、中、低空，远、中、近程的全空域杀伤能力和快速反应能力的防空作战力量。
    空军雷达兵部队建于1949年9月，她是以雷达获取空中情报的兵种。空军雷达兵部队自50年代初建立以上海为中心的第一个监视情报系统以来，已由目力监视过渡到使用雷达探测；由点状部署扩展成为雷达警戒线；由地区性雷达情报连接成全国性雷达情报网，基本覆盖了全国领空。
    空降兵部队于1950年9月成立。近40年来，这支部队已经发展成为由步兵、炮兵、通讯兵、工兵和防化兵等兵种组成的现代化部队，配合陆军、海军、空军、地方部队和民兵，在祖国各地执行过无数次各种类型的战斗演习。
