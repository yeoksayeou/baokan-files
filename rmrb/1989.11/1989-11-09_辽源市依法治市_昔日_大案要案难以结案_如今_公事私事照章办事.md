Formerly, the leaders of Liaoyuan City in Jilin Province were plagued by endless petitions and lawsuits. Now, they have broken free from this cycle and have more energy and time to focus on rectification and deepening reforms. Liaoyuan City is implementing governance by law, continuously improving local regulations, and gradually forming a new pattern of legal management, which has promoted the development of various tasks across the city.

In early 1988, the Liaoyuan Municipal Party Committee, Municipal People's Congress, and Municipal Government issued relevant regulations on governance by law and established a leading group for governance by law headed by Secretary Wei Yunguo. Based on extensive investigations and research, and in accordance with national laws and local conditions, they formulated more than 40 local regulations, including "Regulations on Activating Small Industrial and Commercial Enterprises" and "Provisional Regulations on Horizontal Economic Cooperation." Each frontline, department, and unit has formulated regulations and management methods suitable to their own conditions based on these rules and regulations.

Currently, Liaoyuan City has a complete set of regulations and systems from top to bottom. The Liaoyuan Vegetable Oil Factory discovered several accounting errors during a self-inspection and voluntarily paid 140,000 yuan in business tax without being prompted. Past contract disputes that troubled city leaders have now been resolved through a contract management network, addressing issues on-site according to the law. From January to September this year, the city avoided contract dispute losses amounting to more than 6 million yuan. In Sandhe Village, Dongfeng County, 60-year-old Men Changsheng and his wife, despite having seven children, were previously neglected by their offspring. The elderly couple's repeated petitions did not resolve the issue. Through learning and applying the law, all seven children voluntarily took care of their parents and even made up for past neglect by paying overdue support fees.

    辽源市依法治市
    昔日　大案要案难以结案
    如今　公事私事照章办事
    本报讯　昔日被上访告状缠得头痛的吉林省辽源市领导，如今已从这个包围圈里解脱出来，腾出更多的精力和时间抓治理整顿和深化改革。辽源市实行依法治市，不断完善本地的各项法规，正在逐步形成依法管理的新格局，促进了全市各项工作的开展。
    1988年初，辽源市委、市人大、市政府先后分别下发了有关依法治市的规定，并成立了以市委书记魏运国为首的依法治市领导小组。他们在大量调查研究的基础上，根据国家法律和本市实际，又先后制定了《关于搞活小型工商企业的规定》、《关于开展横向经济联合的暂行规定》等40多个地方性法规。各条战线、各个部门和单位依据这些规章和管理办法，也都制订了符合自己实际的规章制度。
    目前，辽源市上上下下各项法规制度成龙配套。市植物油厂在自检中查出几笔漏帐，不用催要，按照章法主动补缴了14万元的营业税。过去搅得市领导头痛的合同纠纷，如今形成的合同管理网起了作用，出现问题就地依法解决。今年1月至9月全市避免合同纠纷损失达600多万元。东丰县沙河村60多岁的门长胜和老伴虽有7个儿女，过去却无人赡养，老人多次上访也没解决问题。通过学法用法，7个儿女都主动赡养老人，还补交了过去的赡养费。
