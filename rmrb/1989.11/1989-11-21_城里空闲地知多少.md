Title: How Much Vacant Land Is There in the City?

Currently, many medium and small cities in our country have a significant amount of vacant land within their urban areas.

According to investigations, three units in Meihekou City, Jilin Province—namely the Food and Aquatic Products Company, the Metal Transfer Station, and the Garden Management Office—have over 150 mu of vacant land. Some units have had vacant land for as long as eight to nine years without utilizing it. These lands neither produce grain nor fulfill the land's carrying capacity, remaining completely idle. Other cities in Jilin Province also exhibit this phenomenon.

What is perplexing is that these medium and small cities continue to encroach on farmland in the suburbs at a rate of about 200 mu per year.

The urban area of Gongzhuling City in Jilin Province covers 14.07 square kilometers. According to the theoretical parameters for the land use structure of medium and small towns (15,000 people per square kilometer), it can accommodate 210,000 people. However, Gongzhuling's urban population is currently only 100,000, and the land area is more than double what is needed. This means that, based on the national population control policies and the annual increase in the urban population, by 2060, the urban area of Gongzhuling will not need to expand to accommodate the new population.

Why do cities have so much vacant land within their urban areas? The main reasons are:

- In the past, land approvals were lax, and land use standards were too high, often approving whatever amount was requested.
- There is a lack of land tracking management, and after some units close or undergo restructuring, the land is not promptly reclaimed.
- Land is granted for lifelong use without cost, leading users to treat it as their own property, making it impossible for anyone to reclaim the usage rights.

### 城里空闲地知多少

　　城里空闲地知多少
　　吉林省土地管理局　杨亚杰
    目前，我国许多中小城市市区内都有很多空闲地。
    据调查，我省梅河口市食品水产公司、金属转运站、园林处等三个单位就有空闲地150多亩。有的单位的空闲地长达八九年之久未利用。这些土地一不产粮食，二没发挥土地承载作用，完全处于空转状态。我省其他城市也有这种现象。
    令人不解的是，这类中小城市每年仍以200亩左右的速度向市郊蚕食耕地。
    我省公主岭市城区面积为14.07平方公里，按照中小城镇15000人／平方公里用地结构理论参数计算，可容纳21万人，而公主岭市区现在仅有10万人，占地面积超过一倍。这就是说，按照国家计划生育控制的人口自然增长率和每年进城人口比例计算，到2060年前，公主岭市区的占地面积根本不用扩大，也足够新增人口的使用。
    为什么城市市区内会出现许多空闲地呢？主要原因是：
    ——过去审批土地不严、用地面积标准过高，往往是申请多少批准多少。
    ——缺乏土地跟踪管理，一些单位关停并转后，土地没有及时收回。
    ——土地终身无偿使用，使用者变相成为所有者，任何人都无法收回其使用权。
