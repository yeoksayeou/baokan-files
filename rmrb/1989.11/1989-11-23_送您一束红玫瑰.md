Ice Heart sat calmly at her desk. As soon as I saw her gentle smile, I knew I had chosen the right flowers.

I and another comrade were commissioned by the magazine "Qunyan" and Comrade Tao Dazong to visit the elderly Ice Heart. The most appropriate gift, of course, was a bouquet of flowers, but the color was a matter of debate. "White is pure," "green is lively," "purple is elegant," "yellow is magnificent," but I had only one thought: to send her a bouquet of red roses.

The autumn sun outside the window shone in, warm and soft, illuminating the old woman's face, which was also soft and warm. This picture included white purity, green vitality, purple elegance, and yellow magnificence, but the strongest feeling it gave was life, a fiery, passionate life force.

The elderly woman sat at her desk, calmly conversing with us, her mind and speech still clear. She mentioned her recent 90th birthday, where a few middle-aged famous writers had entered the room and insisted on kneeling to pay their respects. Her grandchildren, seeing this, also wanted to kneel... The old woman smiled and politely declined. Happiness seemed to need to be shared, so she pressed the bell on her desk and casually called out, "Second Daughter." I thought she must be calling a child, but to my surprise, the one who entered was the old woman's second daughter. She carried a delicate small vase, in which a few of the red roses we brought were placed. She told her mother that the rest had been placed in front of Zhou Enlai's portrait. The old woman nodded in approval, "Yes, just like every time." What a considerate daughter! This must be the "Second Daughter" mentioned many times in the old woman's articles, who loves to raise cats, is a member of the municipal people's congress, and teaches foreign languages, Wu Qing. She should be over fifty, but in front of her mother, she is still the obedient "Second Daughter."

Seeing Ice Heart, one would think of another beloved figure thousands of miles away, Ba Jin. Here, one could always get the latest information about him. Following the old woman's instructions, I opened a neatly wrapped paper box. Inside, tightly nestled, was a bamboo vase with an ancient design. This was her prepared birthday gift for Ba Jin, but even more precious was the elegant calligraphy on xuan paper:

This vase represents my birthday wishes to you!
It will stand by your side at all times, and from the ever-blooming flowers and lush leaves it nurtures, you will see my smile!
To Ba Jin, my younger brother,
Ice Heart
Deep autumn, 1989

The old woman had a beautiful box, specially used to store Ba Jin's letters. She took out the most recent one, which contained the following words: "Ninety years old! You are not old! Your articles still move the hearts of millions of readers. Recently, I often think that you are like a bright lamp. Seeing the light, we feel at ease..."

Holding this letter, we sat in silence for a long time. Indeed, the goodness and beauty of feelings were transmitted, permeated, and elevated in our hearts. "Second Daughter" and the family's constant companionship, Ba Jin and friends' sincere care, made the old woman immerse herself in the warmth of family and friendship. She had bid farewell to many loved ones, but she always lived among them. At this moment, looking again at the red roses on the old woman's desk, a few sparse blooms seemed to have gained more tranquility and delicacy. The slightly open petals, as if speaking and then stopping, as if wanting to speak but hesitating, the spirit and vitality of the flowers were awakened by the old woman, enveloped in the warmth surrounding the old woman. Not a dense cluster of flowers, but also a smiling face.

Those who have read Ice Heart's works, generation after generation, are all familiar with her smile, a faint, sweet smile, permeating every line and word. The gentleness of a woman, the warmth of a mother, smooth, serene, and pure, this seems to be all of Ice Heart.

But those who have always been reading Ice Heart's works can feel her changes, the sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy of her 70-year creative career. When she sang praises to maternal love and childhood with fresh and bright tones, she played a sweet and gentle melody of dreams. In her short story "Division" and other works, she sang a sad and bitter song: inevitable disasters, the loss of loved ones, suppressed and bitter days. But what moved people the most was the youthful spirit in her recent works. Why? Countless "little readers" and "old readers" are paying attention, just when she should be enjoying her twilight years, why return to youth?

The passage of time leaves rings on a tree, but on a person, it leaves the journey from youth to old age. There are trees and flowers in the world. Ice Heart loves flowers, but her heart must bear the burden of a tree. A tree with ninety rings, rooted in her delicate yet strong heart. Every twist and turn in the nation's progress has left deep marks on the old tree. After experiencing sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy, this ancient tree of life will surely sprout new leaves and bloom new flowers, and those flowers will be fragrant and sweet... red like these red roses.

For all this, Ice Heart, sending you a bouquet of red roses.

### 送您一束红玫瑰

    送您一束红玫瑰
　　叶稚珊
    冰心安坐在书桌旁边，一看到她那谦和的笑脸，我就知道这束花选对了。
    我和另一同志受《群言》杂志和陶大镛同志委托，去看望冰心老人，最合适的礼物当然是一束花，但选什么颜色却其说不一。“白的纯洁”，“绿的有生气”，“紫的高雅”，“黄的华贵”，而我却只有一个念头，送她一束红玫瑰。
    窗外深秋的阳光射进来，暖暖的，柔柔的，映衬着老人的脸，也柔柔的，暖暖的。这幅图画中有白的纯洁、绿的生气、紫的高雅和黄的华贵，而给人最强烈的感觉却是生命，是热烈的火一样的生命力。
    老人坐在书桌旁安祥地和我们交谈，神清气爽，思路、口齿还是那么清晰。说起不久前她的九十岁生日，几个中年名作家进门硬是扑到地上给她叩头，儿孙们见状也争着要叩……老人笑着婉谢了，快乐似乎需要有人分享，于是按响桌边的电铃，随口叫着“老二”。我以为一定是唤一个孩子，没料到进来的是老人的二女儿。她端着一个精巧的小花瓶，里面插了几枝我们带来的红玫瑰。她告诉妈妈，其余的大部分都放在周总理像前了。老人赞许地点着头，“对，像每次一样。”一个多么善解人意的女儿！这一定就是老人多次在文章中提到的爱养猫的、当了市人大代表的、教外文的吴青，算来她应在五十岁以上了，但在母亲面前却还是乖乖的“老二”。
    见到冰心，就会想起千里之外另一位受人爱戴的巴金。在这里总可以得到他最新最近的信息。依照老人的指点，我打开了一个包装好的纸匣，里面紧拥着一只造型古拙的竹编花瓶。这是她准备托人带给巴金的生日礼物，比这更珍贵的是宣纸上的几行纤秀的毛笔字：
    这只花瓶代表我向你祝寿！
    她将时刻站立在你的座旁，你将从她所供养的四时不断的繁花密叶中，看到我的微笑！巴金老弟
                      冰心
                        己巳深秋
    老人有一个精美的盒子，专门存放巴金的信。她拿出最近的一封，其中有这样的字句：“九十岁！您并不老！您的文章还打动千万读者的心。最近我常常想，您好像一盏明亮的灯，看见灯光，我们就心安了……”
    捧着这封信，我们无言静坐了好久，真的，善的，美的情感在我们心头传递、弥漫、升华。“老二”和亲人们的朝夕相伴，巴金和朋友们的诚挚关怀，使老人沉浸在亲情和友情中。她送走了许多亲人，但她却始终生活在亲人中。这时，再望一眼老人案头的红玫瑰，寥寥几枝，竟比原来那一束又多了几分沉静和细腻。微张的花瓣，欲说还休，欲言又止，花的灵性、活气竟被老人唤起，被笼罩着老人的一片温馨所打动。不是繁花密叶，却也有一张笑脸。
    读过冰心作品的人，整整几代人，都熟悉她的这种微笑，淡淡的、甜甜的微笑，浸透在字里行间。女性的柔美，母爱的温厚，舒缓、恬静和清醇，这似乎就是全部的冰心。
    而一直在读冰心作品的人却感觉出她的变化，她的70年创作生涯的甜、酸、苦、辣。她用清新明媚的语调歌颂母爱和童心的时候，奏响的是梦幻般的甜柔的乐章。她在短篇小说《分》和其他一些作品中唱出的是忧郁酸辛的歌：不可避免的劫难，亲人的逝去，压抑和苦涩的日子。而最打动人的是她近年来作品中的青春气息。为什么？多少“小读者”和“老读者”在关注着，正应该颐养天年的时候，为什么返老还童呢？
    流逝的时光，给大树刻下的是年轮，留给人的却是由青春到衰老。世上有树也有花，冰心爱花，但她心中却要承受着树的负载，一棵有九十道年轮的老树，植根于她纤细而坚强的心中。民族进程中的每一个曲折，都在老树上留下了深深的痕迹。在经历了甜、酸、苦、辣之后，这棵古老的生命之树，还会再绽出新绿，开出新花，那花一定芬芳甜美……红红的，像这红玫瑰。
    为这一切，冰心老人，送您一束红玫瑰。
