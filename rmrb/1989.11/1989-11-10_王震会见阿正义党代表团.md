Wang Zhen, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, met with a delegation from Argentina's Justice Party in the Great Hall of the People this morning. The delegation was led by Eduardo Menem, a member of the National Committee and acting President of the Senate.

Wang Zhen, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended a warm welcome to the delegation. He said that the friendly relations between the Argentine Justice Party and China and the Communist Party of China have a long history. The late leader of the Argentine Justice Party, Peron, is a familiar figure to the Chinese people. During his lifetime, he harbored friendly feelings towards Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese people.

Wang Zhen said that in recent years, exchanges between China and Argentina have increased annually, promoting mutual understanding and friendship. Maintaining regular friendly exchanges between the Communist Party of China and the Argentine Justice Party is beneficial to the development of friendly cooperative relations between the two countries.

Wang Zhen said that both China and Argentina belong to the Third World, and on the two major issues facing humanity today—peace and development—China and Argentina can closely cooperate and advance together.

Menem said that the Argentine Justice Party has a very friendly relationship with the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government.

He said that he had read the speech given by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of New China and was very appreciative of China's domestic and foreign policies.

The Argentine delegation arrived in Shanghai on November 4 to begin their visit to China.
