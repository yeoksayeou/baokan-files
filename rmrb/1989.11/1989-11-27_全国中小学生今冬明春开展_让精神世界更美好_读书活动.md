China Education Daily and China Youth Daily (including the junior high school edition) jointly initiated the "Enriching the Mind" reading activity for primary and secondary school students nationwide. At the opening ceremony held recently, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Yan Jici, Ye Fei, and Liao Hansheng, as well as senior military officer Sun Yi, who is dedicated to youth education, and Vice Secretary of the State Council Liu Zhongde attended to offer their warm congratulations.

Principals from five schools, including Shaanxi Province's Yan'an Zao Yuan Primary School, traveled to Beijing to participate in the opening ceremony. Beijing's New Century Education Bookstore and Shandong Science and Technology Press, among six publishing houses, donated a total of over 6,000 books to the five principals.

The 38 recommended books for this activity have all been approved by the State Education Commission's Office for Primary and Secondary School Textbooks.

The "Enriching the Mind" reading activity will be launched this winter and next spring, with an award ceremony scheduled to be held before the 1990 "June 1" Children's Day.
