Early November, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) held its 22nd General Conference in Paris. During the conference, 167 people spoke, representing their respective countries, international organizations, and intergovernmental organizations. They discussed the issues facing UNESCO in the political and operational domains, particularly the activity plan for the next six years. One prominent topic was how to narrow the widening gap between the South and the North.

After admitting Djibouti, the Cook Islands, and Kiribati, UNESCO's membership increased to 161 countries, with developing countries making up the majority. Many representatives pointed out that in recent years, the advancement of modern science and technology has not only failed to narrow the gap between the South and the North but has instead created a massive chasm. This is mainly reflected in the following ways: the per capita income of most developing countries is lower than it was a decade ago; the $1 trillion debt burden has hindered the economic and educational development of Third World countries; rapid population growth and low literacy rates have led to a 900 million-strong illiterate population, accounting for 98% of the world's illiterates; during industrial development, developing countries have become victims of environmental pollution; the struggle to uphold human rights and combat colonialism and racism still faces significant pressures.

The gap between the South and the North cannot be resolved in the short term. However, people believe that the international community has a responsibility to stop and change this harmful and extremely unreasonable phenomenon of extreme wealth disparity. The significance of this conference lies in its discussion of the causes of these problems from political, economic, social, and cultural perspectives. The Nigerian Minister of Education said, "The money we work hard to earn flows back into the pockets of developed countries. What do we use to develop education?" The Cuban representative pointed out that developed countries always view others as raw material markets. The Swiss representative also believed that the development of science has not brought benefits to Third World countries.

As an organization for intellectual development, UNESCO's proposed solution is to develop human resources. The speeches of hundreds of education ministers all emphasized that developing education is an effective measure for national strength and prosperity. Currently, the vicious cycle where broad developing countries lag economically and cannot develop education, while poor education drags down the economy, must be changed as soon as possible. The mid-term development plan discussed at this conference prioritizes education and the future as its most important project, and people have high hopes for it. Many representatives expressed their willingness to take practical actions to welcome the "Literacy Year" in 1990 and strive towards the goal of basic literacy by the year 2000.

Some representatives from developed countries also promised to increase financial aid, as the existence of numerous illiterates in Third World countries is also detrimental to developed countries.

The issue of freedom of news dissemination in the mid-term plan reflects another aspect of the divide between the South and the North. Third World countries generally support the free dissemination of news and information, which is necessary and beneficial for the cultural, social, and economic development of their countries. However, most countries oppose the one-way freedom advocated by Western countries. Some representatives pointed out that the news freedom emphasized by developed countries is actually a form of "cultural invasion." An African representative said, "We do not oppose news freedom, but we oppose the distorted propaganda of monopolists." Broad Third World countries demand balanced, two-way exchanges. The draft mid-term plan acknowledges the legitimacy of developing countries' demand to establish a "New World Information and Communication Order," but this has been opposed by some developed countries. It can be foreseen that the debate between the South and the North on the issue of news dissemination freedom will be intense, and the contradictions will be difficult to resolve in the short term.

People believe that narrowing the gap between the South and the North ultimately depends on the efforts of each country. UNESCO's advocacy for cooperation can only play a promotional role. Over the past two years, the international situation has been moving towards easing, which should have been conducive to multilateral cooperation in the field of education, science, and culture worldwide. However, people cannot ignore the fact that the current international stage still has a very serious bias towards the East-West divide and neglects the South-North divide. Various signs indicate that the attention of some Western countries is not truly focused on Third World countries. Due to the stagnation of South-North relations, UNESCO will have to make even greater efforts to continue playing its role as a catalyst for intellectual development and cooperation.

    “南北之间的鸿沟要缩小”
     ——教科文组织全体会议辩论侧记
     本报记者  张启华
    11月初，联合国教科文组织在巴黎召开22次全体会议，会上共有167人发言，他们代表自己的国家、国际组织和政府间组织，就当前教科文组织在政治和业务领域中面临的问题，特别是关于今后6年的活动计划发表了各自的看法，其中一个突出的话题是如何缩小日趋严重的南北之间的鸿沟。
    教科文组织在吸收吉布提、库克群岛和基里巴斯之后，会员国达161个，发展中国家占了绝大多数。许多代表在发言中指出，近年来现代科学技术的进步，不但没有缩小南北之间的差距，反而造成一条巨大的鸿沟。这主要表现在：大多数发展中国家的人均实际收入比十年前还要低；一万多亿美元的债务束缚了第三世界国家经济和教育的发展；人口增加太快，教育普及率不高，文盲队伍已上升到9亿人，占全世界文盲的98％；在工业发展过程中，发展中国家成了环境污染的牺牲品；维护人权、反对殖民主义、种族主义的斗争仍面临巨大的压力。
    南北之间的差距短时间是无法解决的。但人们认为，国际社会有责任制止、并改变这种有害的、极不合理的贫富过于悬殊的现象。这次大会辩论的意义，首先就在于它从政治、经济、社会、文化各个角度阐述了产生这些问题的原因。尼日利亚教育部长说，我们辛辛苦苦赚来的钱又流回到发达国家的腰包里，人们用什么去发展教育？古巴代表指出，发达国家总是把别人看成是原料市场。瑞士代表也认为，科学的发展，并没有给第三世界国家带来利益。
    教科文组织作为智力发展机构，它所提供的解决办法就是开发人力资源。上百个教育部长的发言都谈到发展教育是强国富民的有效措施。目前，广大发展中国家因经济落后无力发展教育、而教育落后又拖经济后腿的恶性循环局面必须尽快改变。本次大会审议的中期发展规划，将教育与未来作为它的头等重要的计划项目，对此，人们寄予很大希望。许多代表都表示要用实际行动迎接1990年“扫盲年”，并朝着2000年基本完成扫盲的目标前进。
    一些发达国家的代表还许诺增加财政援助，因为实践表明，第三世界国家存在众多文盲对发达国家同样是不利的。
    中期规划中的新闻传播自由问题，体现了南北之间另一方面的分歧。应该说，第三世界国家也赞成新闻、信息的自由传播，这对本国的文化、社会、经济的发展是必要的、有利的。但大多数国家都反对西方国家奉行的单向自由传播，有的代表指出，发达国家所强调的新闻自由，实际上是一种“文化入侵”。一位非洲代表说，我们不反对新闻自由，而是反对垄断者的歪曲宣传。广大第三世界国家要求实行均衡的、双向的交流。中期规划草案已写上承认发展中国家要求建立“世界新闻和传播新秩序的合法性”，但遭到一些发达国家的反对。可以预见，南北之间在新闻传播自由问题上的争论将是激烈的，矛盾在短期内难以解决。
    人们认为，缩小南北之间的差距，说到底要依靠本国的努力，教科文组织倡导的合作只能起促进作用。近两年来，国际形势朝着缓和方向发展，这本应有利于世界范围的教科文领域的多边合作，但人们不能忽略，在当前国际舞台上，重东西，轻南北的偏向依然十分严重。种种迹象表明，一些西方国家的注意力并不真正放在第三世界国家。由于南北关系停滞不前，教科文组织要继续发挥其智力开发与合作的催化剂作用，势必要付出更艰巨的努力。
