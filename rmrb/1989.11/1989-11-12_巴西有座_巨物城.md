In mid-September, we were conducting interviews in the southeastern region of São Paulo, Brazil, and on the way, we visited a small city named Idu. This city has a population of about 100,000 and is famous for producing and selling "giant products," earning it the nickname "City of Giants." Walking through the streets, it felt as if we had entered a mythical land of giants.

In the city center, a large park stands with a public telephone that resembles a giant ear. It is 8 meters tall and serves as a symbol of the "City of Giants." Further ahead, at a crossroads, there is a gas station that is another massive structure. The fuel pumps are taller than typical house eaves, and the fuel nozzles are like large cannons—two strong men would struggle to lift them!

The shops and stalls in the city sell all sorts of "giant products": round ballpoint pens and pencils come in various colors, each about 2 feet long, with the thickest having a diameter of about 3 inches; matchboxes are as large as lunch boxes; a deck of playing cards weighs about 2 pounds, with each card the size of a 16-page book; thermometers are about a meter high, looking like vertical shop signs from a distance. Other daily and cultural items, such as slippers, straw hats, door locks, knives, axes, notebooks, and erasers for students, are all several times larger, even up to 10 times larger than regular items. Every shop uses the word "giant" to attract customers. We bought ice cream on the street to quench our thirst, and when we took it out, it was over a foot long and thicker than a child's arm. The three of us shared one ice cream, but we still couldn't finish it.

Local residents told us that producing and selling giant items here is meant to express the vastness of Brazil's territory and the creativity of its people. The goal is to attract tourists and develop the tourism industry.

It is understood that every year, more than 100,000 domestic and international tourists come to the "City of Giants" to visit, exceeding the local population.

    巴西有座“巨物城”
    兰才基
    9月中旬，我们在巴西圣保罗东南部地区采访，顺路来到一座名叫伊杜的小城。这座城市约有10万人口，以生产和销售“巨型商品”而遐迩闻名，有“巨物城”之称。漫步街头，仿佛进入了一个“巨人国”的神话世界。
    在市中心区，绿茵如盖的街心公园耸立着一部形似大耳朵的公用电话，它的高度竟达8米，这是“巨物城”的一个象征。再往前走，十字路口旁汽车加油站是另一个庞然大物，加油器比一般的屋檐还要高，那油枪就像个大炮筒，两个壮汉也未必能把它抬起！
    市内商店和小摊出售各种各样的“巨型商品”：五颜六色的圆珠笔和铅笔每枝都有2尺多长，最粗的直径约有3寸；火柴盒大如饭盒；一副扑克牌足有两斤重，每张牌像16开纸那么大；温度计约有一米高，远看如同竖挂的店门招牌。其它许多日用品和文化用品，如拖鞋、草帽、门锁、刀子、斧头、笔记本以及小学生用的橡皮擦等等，都比一般商品大好几倍甚至上10倍，各家商店无不以一个“巨”字来招揽生意。我们在街上买冰棍解渴，取出一看，好家伙，每根一尺多长，比小孩胳臂还粗，同行3人共吃一根冰棍，结果还是没有把它吃完。
    当地居民告诉我们，这里生产和销售“巨物”，其意在于表达巴西国土辽阔和人民具有创造精神，目的是为了吸引游客，发展旅游事业。
    据了解，每年来“巨物城”参观旅行的国内外游客达10多万人，超过当地人口的总数。
