Tightening policies are the core of rectifying the economic environment. Implementing these policies to reduce aggregate demand and curb inflation requires solving many problems. Here, we discuss two important issues.

The key to tightening aggregate demand is to enhance the central government's macroeconomic control capabilities.

Fundamentally, China's inflation is caused by aggregate demand exceeding aggregate supply. To rectify the economic environment and control inflation, it is necessary to tighten aggregate demand. The key to tightening aggregate demand, we believe, is to enhance the central government's macroeconomic control capabilities.

Compared to previous adjustments, the current tightening of aggregate demand faces a major challenge: the weakening of the central government's macroeconomic control capabilities. Adjustments, fundamentally, involve readjusting interests; some need to be suppressed, some need to be protected; some need to be taken, some need to be abandoned. Inevitably, there will be conflicts with the existing interests of local governments, enterprises, and departments. Currently, every department, locality, and enterprise opposes "one-size-fits-all" policies and advocates differentiated treatment, but their starting points are different. For example, coastal regions believe they have favorable economic conditions and can accelerate development, while inland regions believe that regional disparities have widened and that underdeveloped regions should be supported. Some departments argue that from the perspective of future industrial development, high-value-added processing industries and basic industries should be developed to enhance development momentum; others argue that from the perspective of current monetary circulation and increased foreign exchange earnings, light textile industries should be developed, and so on. All these arguments, from a local perspective, are reasonable. This requires a comprehensive and balanced approach from a national perspective, weighing the pros and cons. To correctly handle the interests of regions and enterprises, and to achieve comprehensive balance, the following are urgently needed: first, to enhance the central government's macroeconomic control capabilities; second, to improve the art of control.

To enhance the central government's macroeconomic control capabilities, first, it is necessary to unify ideological understanding and firmly implement the central government's tightening policies, advocating a focus on the overall situation, with local governments subordinating to the central government, and not overly emphasizing local specialties and flexibility. Rectifying the economic environment requires emphasizing planning adjustments and the seriousness of planning. An important tool for the central government's macroeconomic control is planning adjustments. Describing the emphasis on planning adjustments as a denial of market adjustments or a return to the old system is incorrect. Currently, there is no purely market-adjusted economy in the world, and a socialist economy based on public ownership cannot ignore the role of planning. Practice has proven that economic liberalism can only bring chaos. Mandatory state plans, including the production and allocation quantities of important production materials and consumer goods, and credit plans, must be strictly enforced. Those who do not implement state plans should be severely punished, not only economically, but also administratively and legally, with no leniency. Without the seriousness and binding force of planning adjustments, the central government's macroeconomic control will inevitably be weakened. Of course, emphasizing planning adjustments does not mean returning to the old path of complete control, but rather seriously studying the combination of planning adjustments and market adjustments, truly respecting the law of value in planning adjustments.

Next, it is necessary to study and adjust the distribution relationships, including the primary and secondary distribution of national income. The decentralization of power and benefits in the past few years has given local governments and enterprises more distribution rights, but national income distribution has been too biased towards individuals, and fiscal revenue has been too biased towards local governments, which is not conducive to macroeconomic control. In improving the enterprise contract responsibility system, it is necessary to adjust the distribution ratio, with the majority of new enterprise profits going to the state. It is necessary to gradually implement post-tax repayment, which is beneficial for compressing investment demand. Enterprise retained profits should be mainly used for development funds as stipulated and should not be diverted for other uses, to control the expansion of consumption funds. It is necessary to reform and improve the fiscal system, appropriately increasing the proportion of central fiscal revenue. It is necessary to do a good job of tax collection from individual laborers and private enterprises, especially to strengthen tax discipline in the circulation sector, and severely punish tax evaders. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the macro-management of finance, rectify financial order, and decisively clean up bank loans, especially working capital loans. It is necessary to adjust the credit fund structure according to the state's industrial policies, ensuring the funding needs of key departments and key products, and resolutely compressing general funding needs. The central government's macroeconomic control is to control the fiscal and financial gates, correctly handle the relationship between the central government and local governments, and reasonably adjust the interests of the state, enterprises, and individuals.

Adjusting the industrial structure and increasing effective supply

Currently, China's economic operation faces two main issues: a severe imbalance between aggregate supply and demand, and increasingly prominent structural contradictions within industries. The imbalance in aggregate quantities and the irrationality of industrial structures are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. Aggregate expansion will further lead to structural deterioration, while structural contradictions will exacerbate aggregate contradictions. The practical question before us is: how to handle the imbalance in aggregate quantities and structural contradictions during economic adjustments? Should we, under the premise of compressing aggregate demand, vigorously adjust the industrial structure to achieve supply-demand balance? Or should we simply emphasize industrial structure adjustments, ignore the huge imbalance in aggregate quantities, and hope to solve structural contradictions within the current aggregate framework?

The issue of industrial structure adjustment is not new; as early as the 12th Party Congress in 1982, it was decided that economic construction should focus on agriculture, energy, transportation, and science and technology as strategic priorities. The state has also adopted many policies and measures to ensure the development of basic industries and agriculture. However, since the economic overheating in 1984, industrial structure adjustments have not only been ineffective but have also shown a worsening trend. The contradiction between the rapid growth of processing industries and the relative stagnation of energy, mining, and raw material industries, the contradiction between the high-speed growth of industry and the slow growth of transportation capacity, and the contradiction between the high population growth rate and the weakening development momentum of agriculture, among others, have become increasingly prominent. We believe that the fundamental reason lies in the expansion of aggregate demand. Under the condition of aggregate demand expansion, structural adjustment is difficult to carry out. Especially during the period of economic system reform, on the one hand, the autonomy and production incentives of local governments and enterprises have been strengthened; on the other hand, the various internal constraints of the economy have not been fully established. At the same time, the price system has not been rationalized, and macroeconomic control has been weak, with the urge for quick results not yet completely overcome. Under these conditions, driven by interests, the expanded investment and consumption demands both show a clear short-term trend. Investment is biased towards general processing industries with high prices and quick returns and short construction periods, exacerbating the contradiction with basic industries; consumption demand is biased towards durable and luxury goods, driving the speed of processing industries, ultimately leading to the imbalance between processing industries and basic industries, and the imbalance between agriculture, energy, transportation, and other sectors.

We often use the term "bottleneck" to describe industries in weak links. "Bottlenecks" are relative to "bottle bodies." There are two ways to solve "bottleneck" problems: one is to quickly expand the "bottleneck" to match the expanded "bottle body"; the other is to control the expansion of the "bottle body" to match the growth of the "bottleneck." Energy, transportation, and raw material industries have large investment amounts, long construction periods, low self-accumulation rates, and are also constrained by various natural resource conditions, with a certain limit to their growth rate. China's agricultural production is constrained by factors such as arable land area, climate conditions, and technological level, making it difficult to achieve long-term stable and high yields. From this, it can be seen that the expansion of "bottlenecks" is limited by objective material conditions. Under limited national strength, excessive demand scale leads to a large amount of human, financial, and material resources being consumed in the "bottle body" sector, which is precisely the reason for the increasingly narrow relative "bottleneck."

Therefore, to get out of the current dilemma, the primary choice is to constrain the expansion of the "bottle body," compress investment demand, control consumption demand, and resolutely limit and shut down or transform a batch of long-process processing industries and resource-intensive, low-efficiency, and highly polluting enterprises, especially some blindly established township enterprises. Efforts should be made to save resources and improve resource utilization rates, striving to reduce the excessive demand for scarce resources. On this basis, it is possible to more effectively implement a tilted policy for "bottleneck" industries and increase effective supply. During the adjustment process, temporary structural unemployment may occur, requiring the state to coordinate and reasonably organize to avoid social problems.

    治理经济环境的两个问题
    周富祥　钟诚
    紧缩政策是治理经济环境的中心内容。实施这一政策，达到压缩社会总需求，抑制通货膨胀的要求，有许多问题需要解决，这里谈谈其中的两个重要问题。
    紧缩总需求的关键是增强中央宏观调控能力
    我国的通货膨胀，从根本上说是社会总需求超过总供给引起的。治理经济环境，控制通货膨胀，必须紧缩总需求。而紧缩总需求的关键，我们认为是增强中央宏观调控能力。
    当前实施的紧缩总需求同历史上几次调整相比，最大难点在于中央宏观调控能力弱化。调整，从根本上来说就是利益的调整，有的要压，有的要保；有的要取，有的要舍，免不了要同地方、企业既有利益发生冲突。现在哪个部门、哪个地方、哪个企业都反对“一刀切”，主张区别对待，可是出发点并不一样。比如，沿海地区认为经济环境优越，有条件加快发展；而内地认为近几年地区差距越来越大，应该扶持落后地区的发展。有的部门从产业今后发展方向说，要发展附加价值高的加工工业，发展基础产业，增强发展后劲；有的从当前回笼货币、增加出口创汇来说，要发展轻纺产品等等，凡此种种，从局部来看，都是不无道理的。这就需要站在全局的角度进行统筹兼顾，权衡利弊得失。为了正确处理地区、企业间的利益关系，搞好综合平衡，当前迫切需要：一是提高中央宏观调控能力；二是提高调控艺术水平。
      提高中央宏观调控能力，首先是要统一思想认识，毫不动摇地执行中央的紧缩方针，提倡顾全大局，地方服从中央，不能过份强调地方的特殊性与灵活性。治理经济环境要重视计划调节，强调计划的严肃性。中央宏观调控一个重要手段，就是计划调节。把重视计划调节说成是否定市场调节、旧体制的复位是错误的。当今世界上没有纯粹的市场调节，以公有制为基础的社会主义经济更不能忽视计划的作用。实践证明，经济上的自由放任只能带来混乱。国家下达的指令性计划，包括重要生产资料和消费品的生产量和调拨量，信贷计划等都必须强制执行，不执行国家计划的要严肃处理，不只是经济处罚，同时要给以行政和法律处分，不能迁就。计划调节没有严肃性与约束力，必然软化中央宏观调控。当然，强调计划调节，并不是要回到过去全部管死的老路上去，而是要认真研究计划调节与市场调节的结合，在计划调节中真正做到尊重价值规律。
    其次，要研究和调整分配关系，包括国民收入的初次分配和再分配。前几年的放权让利，使地方和企业有了较多的分配权，但是，国民收入分配过于向个人倾斜，国家财政收入过于向地方倾斜，不利于宏观调控。在完善企业承包经营责任制中，要调整分配比例，企业新增利润，大头应给国家。要逐步推行税后还贷，这样有利于压缩投资需求。企业留利应按规定主要用于发展基金，不能挤占挪作它用，以控制消费基金膨胀。要改革和完善财政体制，适当提高中央财政收入的比重。做好对个体劳动者和私营工商业企业的征税工作，特别要加强流通领域的税务纪律，重罚逃漏税者。同时，要加强金融的宏观管理，整顿金融秩序，下决心清理银行贷款特别是流动资金贷款，要按照国家制定的产业政策，调整信贷资金结构，保证重点部门和重点产品生产的资金需要，坚决压缩一般的资金需求。中央的宏观调控就是要把住财政和金融两个闸门，正确处理中央和地方的关系，合理调节国家、企业、个人三者的利益。
      调整产业结构，增加有效供给
      当前我国经济运行中，一方面是社会供求总量之间的严重不平衡，另一方面是产业结构性矛盾愈益突出。总量不平衡与产业结构不合理二者相互制约，相互推动。总量膨胀，会进一步导致结构恶化，而结构性矛盾又会加剧总量矛盾。摆在我们面前的现实问题是：总量不平衡与结构性矛盾在经济调整过程中如何处理？是在压缩总需求的前提下，大力调整产业结构，以实现供求平衡；还是单纯强调产业结构调整，忽视总量的巨大不平衡，企望在现有的总量格局下解决结构性矛盾？
      产业结构调整问题，不是近几年才提出来的，早在1982年党的十二大就确定了经济建设要以农业、能源、交通运输、科学技术为战略重点，国家也采取了许多保证基础工业、农业发展的政策、措施。然而，自1984年经济过热增长以来，调整产业结构不仅收效甚微，而且呈恶化趋势。加工工业过快增长与能源、采掘、原材料工业生产相对滞后的矛盾，工业的高速增长与交通运输能力缓慢增长的矛盾，人口的高增长率与农业生产发展后劲明显减弱的矛盾，等等，日益显得突出。我们认为，其根本原因在于总需求膨胀。在总需求膨胀的情况下，结构调整很难进行。尤其在经济体制改革时期，一方面，地方、企业的自主经营权力和生产动力有所增强；另一方面，经济内部的各种约束机制还没有建立健全。同时，价格体系还没有理顺，加上宏观调控不力，急于求成思想还没有完全克服。在这种条件下，受利益驱动，膨胀的投资需求和消费需求都表现出明显的短期化趋向。投资偏向于那些价高利大、建设周期短的一般加工工业，使得与基础工业的矛盾日益增大；消费需求向耐用消费品、奢侈品倾斜，拉动加工工业的速度，最终导致加工工业与基础工业发展失调，与农业、能源、交通等部门的发展失调。
    我们常用“瓶颈”形容处于薄弱环节的产业，“瓶颈”是相对于“瓶身”而言的，解决“瓶颈”问题有两条路子，一条是迅速扩张“瓶颈”，使之与扩展的“瓶身”相适应；一条是控制“瓶身”的膨胀，使之与“瓶颈”的增长相适应。能源、交通、原材料等基础产业，投资数量大，建设周期长，自我积累率低，且又受到各种自然资源条件的约束，数量增长幅度有一定限度。我国农业生产受耕地面积、气候状况、科技水平等因素制约，要做到长期稳产高产难度亦相当大。由此看来，受客观物质条件的限制，“瓶颈”的扩张有很大的限度。在有限的国力下，需求规模过大，导致大量的人力、财力、物力消耗在“瓶身”部门，也正是导致“瓶颈”日益相对狭窄的原因。
      因此，要走出当前困境，首要的选择只能是约束“瓶身”的扩张，压缩投资需求，控制消费需求，坚决限制和关停并转一批长线加工工业和资源消耗大、经济效益差、污染严重的企业，特别是一些盲目上马的乡镇企业，下力量在节约资源和提高资源利用率上做文章，努力降低对稀缺资源的过度需求。在这个前提下，才能更有效地对“瓶颈”产业实行倾斜政策，增加有效供给。在调整过程中，难免会出现暂时的结构性失业现象，需要国家统筹安排，合理组织，避免发生社会性问题。
