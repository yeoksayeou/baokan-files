Life Nurtures Literature
Tán Tán

Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in his congratulatory message to the Fourth National Congress of Literature and Art, said: "To educate the people, one must first be educated oneself. To provide nourishment for the people, one must first absorb nourishment oneself. Who is to educate the literary and artistic workers and provide them with nourishment? The Marxist answer can only be: the people. The people are the mothers of literary and artistic workers. The artistic life of all progressive literary and artistic work lies in their blood and flesh connection with the people." "The people need art, and art needs the people even more. Consciously drawing materials, themes, plots, language, poetry, and imagery from the people's lives, and nourishing oneself with the people's spirit of creating history, this is the fundamental path for the prosperity of our socialist literary and artistic undertakings." I am a literary worker who "climbed out" of the coal mines. It was the fiery life that sent me on the path of literary creation. Reflecting on my actual feelings in creation, I feel even more that Comrade Xiaoping's teachings are extremely correct.

In early 1984, I had just started professional creation and, with the support of the Party organization, returned to the coal mine where I had worked and lived for more than ten years to immerse myself in life. I met many old friends. After several years of separation, their appearance and laughter were still so familiar to me. However, when we started talking, I suddenly felt a sense of unfamiliarity with them. What they cared about, I no longer cared about; what they worried about, I no longer worried about; what they were interested in, I was no longer interested in. I found that there was a gap between my thoughts and feelings and those of this group of miner friends. I went from one mine to another, from one miner's family to another. I studied production matters with them, handled some life disputes, and even went with them to higher-level agencies to petition... I tried to find back those things I had lost. A mine director with considerable influence in the mining area wanted to step down from his leadership position and was temporarily unable to understand it, so he came to vent his grievances to me. He said: "Now I am a 'three-five' cadre with 'four deaths'! Joined the work in the 1950s, over fifty years old, fifty or sixty yuan salary. In 1958, I worked hard during the Great Leap Forward and nearly died; in 1960, I suffered during the hard times and nearly starved to death; during the Cultural Revolution, I was labeled a 'capitalist roader' and nearly fought to death; in the 1980s, I needed a diploma and nearly died of anger!" His frankness and sincerity moved me greatly. His pain was the "birth pains" of that generation of cadres at the time of reform. I affirmed and praised his fiery history of the past decades and also analyzed with him the historical responsibilities on his shoulders today, making him finally realize: his most creative years have passed. The revolutionary cause must be fought on by generation after generation. It is better to pass the baton to younger and more energetic comrades as soon as possible. They have more energy, more acute thinking, and more up-to-date knowledge, so they will definitely run faster than me. I helped him happily step down from his leadership position. These experiences enriched me, filled me, and enabled me to quickly write the novel "Mountain Love," which reflects the reform of the mines.

In the winter of 1985, the organization arranged for me to go to Lěngshuǐjiāng City to immerse myself in life and concurrently serve as the deputy secretary of the municipal party committee. One day, I returned to my residence in Lěngshuǐjiāng from Changsha and saw a note: I came to see you, but you were not there. I really wanted to see you. I am still in the old place. Zhou Zhōnghàn. I was stunned: he came, and he was still in the old place? He had been on that mountaintop for eighteen whole years! We joined the army together, demobilized together, and returned to the coal mine. We first worked in the mine's central area. Later, a wind shaft was opened, and the mine transferred his family there. Eight years later, when I was a reporter for the Workers' Daily, I returned to the mine for a report, and upon inquiry, he was still on the mountain. There was no road there, and I walked for more than two hours to see him. He lived in a makeshift shed, and his two children were already in school. But there was no school within a radius of seven or eight miles, so he had to leave one with his parents and one with his in-laws. It was then that I felt the difficulty of their life on the mountaintop! Now, another ten years have passed, and he actually... Did he think, seeing me come here to serve as the deputy secretary of the municipal party committee, that I would help him transfer to a place? Yes, he should come down the mountain!

The next day, I set out to see him. To solve some of his requests, I specially brought along the party committee secretary of the mining area, Old Zhang. As soon as we met, I asked him: "How is your health?" "Good!" "Work?" "Good!" "Family?" "Good!" A string of "goods." I knew his nature was slow, so I prompted him: "Are there any difficulties? Just say it, your secretary is here." "None." "You've been on this mountain for nearly twenty years, have you ever thought about changing places?" "I have. But I also thought, someone has to do it on this mountain!"

My heart was strongly shaken. I felt that in front of this ordinary miner, in front of this old comrade-in-arms, I suddenly became shorter! His extremely ordinary words rang like a bell in my ears, urging me to be a better person, to be a better writer...

The people are my teacher; the people are my mother. The people nurture me, and I will never forget the people.

　　生活养育了文学
　　谭谈
    邓小平同志在全国第四次文代会的祝词中说：“要教育人民，必须自己先受教育。要给人民以营养，必须自己先吸收营养。由谁来教育文艺工作者，给他们以营养呢？马克思主义的回答只能是：人民。人民是文艺工作者的母亲。一切进步文艺工作的艺术生命，就在于他们同人民之间的血肉联系。”“人民需要艺术，艺术更需要人民。自觉地在人民的生活中汲取题材、主题、情节、语言、诗情和画意，用人民创造历史的奋发精神来哺育自己，这就是我们社会主义文艺事业兴旺发达的根本道路。”我是从煤矿“爬”出来的文艺工作者，是火热的生活送我走上文学创作道路的。回想自己在创作中的实际感受，更使我感到小平同志这一教导的无比正确。
    一九八四年初，我刚刚从事专业创作不久，在党组织的支持下，回到我曾经劳动、生活了十多年的煤矿深入生活。我和许多老朋友见面了。分别几年了，他们的音容笑貌，我依然是那么熟悉。然而，我们一交谈，突然感到自己对他们有了一种陌生感。他们关心的事，我不关心了；他们着急的事，我不着急了；他们感兴趣的事，我不感兴趣了。我发现，自己和这群矿工朋友思想感情上有一段距离了。我从这个矿走到那个矿，从这个矿工家庭串到那个矿工家庭。和他们一起研究一些生产上的事情，一起处理一些生活上的纠纷，甚至和他们一起到上级机关上访……我努力去寻回那些自己已经失落的东西。一位在矿区颇有威望的矿长，要从领导岗位上退下来，心里一时想不通，找我来发牢骚。他说：“我现在是‘三五’干部‘四个死’！五十年代参加工作，五十多岁年纪，五、六十块钱工资。五八年搞大跃进，我累得死；六○年过苦日子，我饿得死；文化大革命当“走资派”，我斗得死；八十年代要文凭，我气得死！他的坦率，他的真诚，使我很感动。他的这种苦恼，是他们那一代干部在改革关头的一种“阵痛”。我肯定和赞扬他过去年代的那一页火红历史，也和他一起分析当今肩头上的历史责任，使他终于认识到了：自己最富于创造性的年岁过去了。革命事业要一代接一代地奋斗下去。早一点把自己手里的接力棒交给年富力强的同志，他们精力比自己充沛，思想比自己敏锐，知识比自己新，跑得也就一定比自己快。我帮助他愉快地从领导岗位上退下来了。这些生活，丰富了我，充实了我，使我很快写出了反映矿山改革的长篇小说《山野情》。
    一九八五年冬，组织上安排我到冷水江市深入生活，兼任那里的市委副书记。有一天，我从长沙回到冷水江住地看到一张纸条：我来看你，你不在。很想见见你。我还在老地方。周忠汉。我怔住了：他来了，他还在老地方？他呆在那座高山顶上，整整十八年了呵！我们俩一起参军，一起复员回煤矿。先在矿中心区工作。后来一座风井开工，矿里把他夫妇俩调了去。八年后，我在《工人日报》当记者，回矿山采访，一打问，他还在山上。那里不通公路，我走了两个多小时的山路，到那里去看他。他住在简易工棚里，两个孩子已上学。但这里方圆七、八里内没有学校，他只好放一个在父母家，放一个在岳父家。我这才感到，他们在这山顶上生活的艰难！如今，又是十年过去了，他居然……他是不是想，看我到这里来担任市委副书记了，要我帮助他调动一个地方？是呵，他应该下山了呵！
    次日，我就动身去看他。为了解决他的一些要求，我特意把矿区党委书记老张也拉上了。一见面，我问他：“身体怎么样？”“好！”“工作呢？”“好！”“家里人呢？”“好！”一串的“好”。我了解他秉性迟钝，便启发他：“有什么困难吗？你只管说，你们书记在这里。”“没有。”“在这山上呆了快二十年了，你是不是想过，换换地方？”“想过。但是，我又想过，这山上横直要人搞呀！”
    我的心强烈地震动了。我感到，自己在这位普通矿工面前，在这位老战友面前，突然间矮了一截！他这极其平常的一句话，像警钟在我的耳畔长鸣，警策我去做人，去做文……
    人民，是我的良师；人民，是我的母亲。人民养育我，我忘不了人民。
