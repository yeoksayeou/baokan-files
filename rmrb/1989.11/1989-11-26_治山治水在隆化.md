The total area of Longhua County in Hebei Province is 5497 square kilometers, of which 50.4% is affected by soil erosion. Each year, 453.9 million tons of sediment are washed away. If this sediment were spread out to a depth of one foot, it would cover an area of 20,000 acres. Along with the soil, 3860 tons of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers are lost. Calculating at a rate of 300 yuan per ton of fertilizer, the county loses 1.158 million yuan annually in this way.

This is the situation in Longhua County.

Does this mean that the people living on this land have no way out? No. The people of Longhua—these descendants of Yu the Great—are now drawing up a new plan to control soil erosion and flooding.

In September of this year, the county was honored with the title of "National Advanced County in Water Conservancy."

The spirit of Beiliang Village in facing the water

Natural disasters and poverty intertwine, causing people's hearts to be scattered. In the western part of Longhua, in the upper reaches of the Shima Tu River in Xibian, the village of Beiliang at the center of a 100-mile radius, some people fled to the Northeast and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in search of a living; some clung to this land but resigned themselves to fate. However, on the other hand, the vast majority of people placed their hopes on their own hands to transform nature.

First, let's talk about Beiliang. On June 3, 1989, a merciless flood swallowed cattle and horses and swept away houses. After the flood, people witnessed a scene of desolation and, with a heavy heart, decided not to hesitate any longer. The old villager Yang Yuku grabbed the arm of the village party secretary Liu Jiang and shouted from the bottom of his heart, "Liu Jiang, lead us all to do it!" The word "do" had been shouted many times before, but this time Liu Jiang heard it differently; this was a call from the hearts of the people, and this was the foundation for controlling soil erosion. When the people truly realized that nature had threatened their survival, someone stood up to rally them, and this spirit was no less than that of a desperate battle. The mission of a Communist Party member and the responsibility of a village party secretary made Liu Jiang determined to lead the villagers to the barren mountains.

However, when the soil erosion control team reached the mid-mountain, the old villager Wu Yong blocked the path with his shoulder pole and shouted, "Whoever controls soil erosion again, I'll break his legs!"

Did Wu Yong really not want to control soil erosion? Liu Jiang understood his heart best. In the past, during the "mass campaign," equalization and "one-size-fits-all" policies had deeply hurt this old man. On the spot, Liu Jiang did not say anything. That night, sitting on the kang (a traditional Chinese heated bed) in his home, the two opened their hearts to each other. The next day, all 39 party members in the village followed Liu Jiang up the mountain, and right behind the party members were Wu Yong and Yang Yuku, who had blocked the path with their shoulder poles, along with more than ten other villagers over sixty years old, as well as the rest of the villagers.

Liu Jiang proposed that each household should contribute labor accumulation points, with rewards for surplus and penalties for deficits. However, there was one point: five-guarantee households and disabled veterans were exempt from labor, and the families of those who fought on the old battlefields and participated in the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in the capital were all exempt from labor. Liu Jiang led the villagers to eat and work on the mountain during the day and returned to the village at night to calculate labor points and keep accounts door-to-door, helping those households with weak labor to solve their difficulties. In a month, the entire village of 507 laborers dug 10,000 water pits and completed 4300 acres of forest and water conservation projects.

The spirit of Beiliang and the people of Beiliang is a microcosm of the people of Longhua. In the village of Dahougou in Huangdi Township, 16 party members took on the responsibility of 16 barren mountains, with 12 party members moving their entire families to the mountains. Party member Huang Xingjun had been the first to go to the mountains seven years ago. At that time, he faced his three brothers who were preparing to leave to seek a living elsewhere and shouted, "I am a party member. As long as I am here, the family is here, the mountains must be controlled, and the people cannot leave!" Finally, the whole family followed him to the mountains, and the four brothers endured the cold and heat, working hard on the mountain for seven years. Now, the mountains are covered with green shadows, and the fruits are fragrant.

Zhao Guocun, the village head with one arm, used one arm to push a small cart, leading the villagers to move 30,000 cubic meters of earth and accumulate 20,000 labor points in four months to control the land in his village of Yijia Camp Upper Gorge. In September, the Xiangmiao Township government set up a stage for celebrating agricultural construction, and the township government awarded red flowers and new iron shovels to 75 model workers from the entire township.

The perseverance of Hai Dai Gorge in moving mountains

Hai Dai Gorge and Bai Zi Gorge are two villages on the same ridge. Initially, for a bundle of firewood, the people of Hai Dai Gorge had their shoulder poles taken by the people of Bai Zi Gorge. The old party secretary of Hai Dai Gorge, Wang Yugui, was so angry that he led the villagers to plant trees and create forests, and he did so for 13 years. The mountains were covered with pines and cypresses, and the village was surrounded by willows, one generation after another, until the entire Hai Dai Gorge was covered with green trees. The adjacent village of Bai Zi Gorge, however, was not in a hurry, watching the people of Hai Dai Gorge busy at work, while their own mountain remained a small patch of "bald head." On June 29, 1983, a heavy rain fell simultaneously in the two gorges. The same amount of water became a timely rain in Hai Dai Gorge, but in Bai Zi Gorge, it became a "frog pond." Fifty acres of land were washed away, exposing the rocks, and 400 acres of crops needed to be replanted. After the flood, the people of Hai Dai Gorge were joyful, while the people of Bai Zi Gorge had a sudden realization: "Give money, give goods, but choose a good party branch."

What was good about the party branch in Hai Dai Gorge? It was that the village leaders had the mindset of Yu. Controlling soil erosion and flooding requires spirit, organization, and most importantly, treating the root cause. Initially, when most people advocated for large-scale leveling of the land below the mountain, someone from above came to force him to bring the tree-planting people down the mountain, Wang Yugui resisted, delayed, and opposed. Finally, he got angry and shouted at Hai Dai Gorge, "For the benefit of future generations, I have made up my mind!" He led the entire village to work day after day and year after year on the mountain. He said, "'Water is like a dragon, flowing from top to bottom. If you don't control the top, the water will come in vain.' This saying has been a folk song for many years. You sing it, I sing it, he sings it, and I don't know how many years we've sung it, but who has really done it?"

This "green difference" is not just happening in Hai Dai Gorge and Bai Zi Gorge. The villages of Xidi and Liangdi in this county are also separated by a single ridge. The party branch secretary of Xidi Village, Liu Jinbang, endured hardships to plant trees and fruit trees, but he did not change his mind. Since 1973, he has led the people to plant red fruits on barren mountains and wilderness, working hard for 15 years. The entire village has 210,000 red fruit trees, producing a million jin annually, and has built a fruit deep-processing base, establishing a production-supply-sales chain, with an average income of over a thousand yuan per person. Liu Jinbang became a national labor model. What about Liangdi Village? In recent years, many people have put their energy into the five small temples that have been built one after another. They bet on the gods' altar for relief from poverty. It is unfair to say they do not control soil erosion, but they do not control it to the root. The embankment in front of the village is washed away and repaired, repaired and washed away, and who knows how many times this has happened.

Although people's understanding of controlling soil erosion varies, the people of Longhua, who have experienced nature's warnings and punishments, have finally made up their minds to thoroughly control soil erosion and flooding. In the Zhang San Camp area of Longhua's "Dujiangyan," the old township head Guo Wenyuan pointed to the layers of mountains in the distance and said meaningfully, "That is the upper reaches of the Luan River. Every stream of water here flows into the Luan River, through Miyun and Panjiakou Reservoir, affecting Beijing, Tianjin, and the entire North China region. We are not only controlling soil erosion for ourselves, but also for the people downstream."

    治山治水在隆化
　　门振成
    河北省隆化县总面积为5497平方公里，而其中水土流失面积占50.4％。每年流走的泥沙总量为453.9万吨，如堆成一尺厚的土层，面积可达2万亩。随土壤流失的氮磷钾肥3860吨，按300元／吨化肥计算，全县每年有115.8万元人民币就这样付之东流了。
    这，就是隆化县的县情。
    难道生活在这块土地上的人们，真的就没有办法了吗？不。隆化人——这些大禹的子孙们，正在推出一幅新的大禹治水图。
    今年9月，这个县荣获“全国水利先进县”称号。
      碑梁村背水一战的劲头
    自然灾害与贫穷交织在一起，造成的是人心离乱。以隆化西川释马吐河上游西庙宫乡碑梁村为中心，方圆百里之内，跑东北、下江浙求生存者有之；依恋这块土地但又听天由命者有之。然而，在另一方面，绝大多数人则把希望寄托在自己的双手对大自然的改造上。
    先说碑梁。1989年6月3日，一场无情的洪水吞噬了牛马，卷走了房屋。大水过后，人们目睹一片惨景痛定思痛，再不犹豫了。老村民杨玉昆拉着村支部书记刘江的胳膊，向这位38岁的共产党员迸出了心底的呼喊：“刘江，你领着大伙干吧！”干，这句话已经喊了好多年了，但这次刘江听得出来，这是发自群众心里的呼声，这就是治山的基础。当群众真正意识到大自然已经危及到生存的时刻，有人出来振臂一呼，这种劲头决不亚于背水一战。一个共产党员的使命和支部书记的责任使刘江横下一条心，带领村民向荒山进发。
    然而，当治山队伍开进山腰的时候，老村民吴永横着扁担，挡住去路，喊着：“谁再治山，我砸断他腿！”
    吴永真的不想治山吗？刘江最了解他的心。过去“大兵团”作战，搞平调，搞“一刀切”，伤透了这位老人的心。当场，刘江没有说什么。晚上，坐在他家炕头上，两个人各自敞开心扉。第二天，全村39名党员跟着刘江上山了，而紧跟在党员后面的便是那横着扁担的吴永和杨玉昆等十几个年过花甲的老村民，以及村里的其他人。
    刘江提出对每户应出的劳动积累工超奖亏罚。但有一点，对五保户、残废军人个人免出工，对在老山前线和参加首都平息反革命暴乱的军人家属全家免出工。刘江白天带领大伙吃在山上，干在山上，晚上回到村里挨门挨户算工记账，帮助那些弱劳力户解决困难。一个月下来，全村507个劳力，共挖水柜1万个，搞林水工程4300亩。
    碑梁人和碑梁精神，是隆化人的缩影。在荒地乡大后沟村，16名党员承包了16座荒山，其中有12名党员举家搬迁到山上。党员黄兴俊7年前就率先进山了。当时，他面对着自己3个准备外出另谋生路的亲兄弟，大声疾呼：“我是党员，我在，家在，山就得治，人就不能走！”终于，全家人跟着他进山了，弟兄4人寒来暑往，在这山上苦干了7个春秋。如今遍山绿荫叠映，瓜果飘香。
    赵国存，这个少了一只胳膊的村长，为了治理他所在的尹家营上沟村那一方土地，硬是用一只胳膊推着小车，领着村民4个月动用土方3万立方米，出劳动积累工2万个。今年9月，西庙宫乡政府搭起农田建设庆功会的大戏台，乡政府为全乡75名劳模披红戴花，并且每人奖励一把新铁锹。
      海岱沟愚公移山的毅力
    海岱沟和柏子沟是两个连在一条梁上的山村。当初，为了一捆柴禾，海岱沟人被柏子沟人扣下过扁担。海岱沟的老支书王玉贵一气之下带领村民植树造林，一干就是13年。山上松柏，村边杨柳，一茬接一茬，直到绿树盖满了整个海岱沟。毗邻的柏子沟村却不急不慌，不紧不慢地看着海岱沟人在那忙乎，而自己的山头依然是一小片“和尚头”。1983年6月29日，一场大雨同时灌向两条沟。同样多的水，在海岱沟成了及时雨，在柏子沟却成了“蛤蟆塘”。50亩川地被冲得见了岩石，400亩庄稼需要改种。洪水过后，海岱沟人喜气洋洋，柏子沟人恍然大悟：“给钱，给物，不如选个好支部。”
    海岱沟的村支部好在哪里呢？就是这个村的带头人有禹的思维。治山治水一靠精神，二靠组织，更重要的是要治在根上。当初，大多数人主张在山下搞大兵团平地时，上头下来人逼着他把栽树的人拉下山，王玉贵顶着、拖着、抗着。最后，他急了，冲着海岱山大喊：“给下辈子人造福，这个主我拿定了！”他领着全村人在山上日复一日，年复一年地干下去。他说：“‘水是一条龙，从上往下行，治上不治下，水来一场空。’这话，早成了口头歌，你唱，我唱，他也唱，不知唱了多少年，可有谁真正这样干呢。”
    这种“绿色的落差”又何止发生在海岱沟和柏子沟呢。这个县的西地村和梁底村不也是一梁之隔吗。西地村党支部书记刘金榜为造林栽果历尽苦难，但他痴心不改。从1973年起，带领群众在荒山野岭上栽红果，苦干15年，全村红果21万株，年产百万斤，还建起了果品深加工基地，搞起了产供销一条龙，人均收入千余元。刘金榜当上了全国劳动模范。而梁底村呢？这些年不少人把精神头都用在相继盖起来的那5座小庙上。他们把解脱贫困的宝，押在神仙的供桌上。说他们不治山，未免过分些，但同样是治却没治到根子上。村前那条坝，冲了修，修了冲，不知反复多少次。
    尽管人们对治水的认识有先有后，但经历了大自然警告和惩罚的隆化人民，终于坚定了根治山和水的决心。在隆化“都江堰”的张三营区，老区长郭文元把手指向那更远的层层山峦，意味深长地说：“那就是滦河的上游，这儿每一条沟的水，都汇集到滦河，流向密云、潘家口水库，关系到京津和整个华北。我们不仅为自己治山，更得为下游人治山。”
