The new presidential palace in Pakistan stands majestically against the mountain and the city. This grand white building in Islamabad is even more elegant and imposing under the reflection of colorful flags. Last night, a grand banquet hosted by Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to welcome Premier Li Peng was held here.

Before the banquet began, Premier Li Peng, accompanied by Benazir Bhutto, entered the brightly lit reception hall to meet 300 Pakistani friends. Warm handshakes and enthusiastic words filled the air as new and old friends rejoiced in their reunion. Benazir Bhutto excitedly told Premier Li that these friends came from all walks of life in Pakistan and from every province in the country. Premier Li sincerely praised the Sino-Pakistani friendship, saying it was "deeply rooted in the hearts of the people," "unaffected by international political changes and internal situations in both countries," and "able to withstand the test of time." The prolonged applause and warm atmosphere in the banquet hall not only left a beautiful memory for the Chinese guests but also heralded the success of Premier Li's visit.

This afternoon, when Premier Li and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto concluded their talks and stepped out of the hall, the reporters following the event noticed that both premiers had smiles on their faces. Indeed, during the talks, they reached a consensus or similar views on major international and regional issues. Both sides expressed a strong desire and determination to strengthen and expand cooperation between the two countries. The four documents signed by the two countries today also indicate that the talks were fruitful.

New friends and old friends share the same feelings, and cherishing friendship is a tradition of the Chinese nation. As a new generation of Chinese leaders, Premier Li Peng's first visit to Pakistan, while making new friends, of course, did not forget to visit old friends. The widow of the late Prime Minister Bhutto, Nusrat Bhutto, is the mother of the current Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and a senior minister in the federal cabinet. When Premier Li Peng and his wife Zhu Lin met this old friend today, Zhu Lin specially wore a traditional Pakistani outfit that was made for her by a Pakistani tailor the day before. Premier Li jokingly asked Mrs. Bhutto, "Do you think she looks like a Pakistani?" Mrs. Bhutto laughed and said, "She looks just like one." Mrs. Bhutto went on to say that 25 years ago, she led a Pakistan International Airlines delegation to Beijing to celebrate the establishment of air links between Pakistan and China, which was the first non-socialist country to have air links with China. Premier Li happily said, "You created a record of friendship between Pakistan and China." The words were heartfelt, and the atmosphere was warm, just like a family gathering.

Pakistani President Ghulam Ishaq Khan is also an old friend of the Chinese people. When he served as the Minister of Finance and Chairman of the Senate, he had visited China many times and had done a lot of work to develop friendly cooperation between the two countries. Tonight, he met with Premier Li, and they were both very happy. Warm words and a grand banquet expressed his deep affection for China.

During this visit to Pakistan, due to time constraints, Premier Li's activities were limited to the capital Islamabad and its sister city Rawalpindi. But tonight, from the Khyber Pass to the Arabian Sea coast, from the Balochistan mountains to the Punjab plains, the entire country of Pakistan could hear the voice of the Chinese Premier on television: "The new generation of leaders of China and Pakistan are determined to pass on the torch of Sino-Pakistani friendship from one generation to the next."

    新朋旧雨喜相逢

    巴基斯坦新总统府倚山临城，这座伊斯兰堡最雄伟的乳白色建筑在五彩缤纷的旗帜辉映下，显得更加雅致、壮观。昨天晚上，巴基斯坦总理贝·布托欢迎李鹏总理的盛大宴会就在这里举行。
    宴会开始前，李总理由贝·布托相陪来到灯火辉煌的会见大厅，同300位巴基斯坦朋友见面。亲切的握手，热情的话语，新朋旧雨喜相逢。贝·布托兴奋地告诉李总理，这些朋友来自巴基斯坦社会各界，来自全国所有省份。李总理由衷地赞扬中巴友谊“深入人心”，“不受国际风云变幻和两国国内情况变化的影响”，“经得起时间的考验”。宴会大厅内久久回荡的掌声和亲如一家人的温馨，不仅给中国客人留下了美好的记忆，而且预示着李总理的这次访问必定圆满成功。
    今天中午，当李总理和贝·布托总理结束会谈步出大厅时，追踪采访的记者们都注意到，两位总理脸上洋溢着笑容。确实，他们在会谈中对重大国际和地区形势问题取得了一致或相似的看法，双方都表示了巩固、加强和扩大两国合作的强烈愿望和决心。两国今天签署的4个文件也表明，会谈是富有成果的。
    新友旧雨一样情，重情义是中华民族的传统。作为中国新一代领导人，李鹏总理首访巴基斯坦在结交新友的同时，当然不忘看望那些老朋友。已故布托总理的遗孀、努斯拉特·布托夫人是现总理贝·布托的母亲，也是联邦内阁的高资部长。李鹏总理和夫人朱琳今天在会见这位老朋友时，朱琳特意穿上了巴基斯坦裁缝昨天才为她制做的一身巴基斯坦民族服装。李总理笑问布托夫人：“您看她像不像巴基斯坦人？”布托夫人笑着说：“像极了。”布托夫人接着说，25年前，她率巴航代表团去北京，庆祝巴中通航，那是第一个非社会主义国家和中国通航。李鹏总理高兴地说：“您创造了巴中友好的一项纪录。”话款款，情融融，就像一家人。
    巴基斯坦总统伊沙克·汗也是中国人民的老朋友。他在任财政部长和参议院主席时，曾多次访华，为发展两国的友好合作做过大量工作。今晚，他和李总理相会，十分高兴。热情的话语和盛大的宴会表达着他对中国的一片深情。
    李总理此次访巴，囿于时间，活动仅限于首都伊斯兰堡和它的姐妹城拉瓦尔品第。但今晚从开伯尔山口到阿拉伯海滨，从俾路支山区到旁遮普平原，巴基斯坦全国都能从电视中听到中国总理这样的声音：中巴两国新一代领导人是有决心把中巴友谊的火炬一代一代传下去的。
