Shanghai medical experts have found through a survey that the family environment has a significant impact on children. The key to optimizing the family environment is to improve the quality of parents.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 23 (Reporter Liu Jun): Renowned pediatrician and professor at Shanghai Medical University, Liu Xiangyun, along with her graduate student Hua Jian, conducted a two-year comparative study of 128 "excellent children" and 128 ordinary children. The study found that the development of children is greatly influenced by their family environment, and the focus of optimizing the family environment is to improve the quality of parents.

The 128 "excellent children" were selected in 1987 from the best 4- to 6-year-old children in Shanghai. According to the same age, gender, kindergarten, and class requirements, 128 ordinary children were selected as controls in a 1:1 ratio. The study then analyzed the physical and mental differences between the two groups of children living in the same social environment and the reasons behind these differences. Professor Liu Xiangyun told the reporter: Although the educational background of parents does not fully represent the family environment, it indeed dominates various aspects of the family. Therefore, the main focus of optimizing the family environment is to improve the quality of parents.

The survey statistics found that children of parents with higher educational backgrounds are not necessarily better than those of parents with lower educational backgrounds. Among the parents of "excellent children," one-third did not attend high school, but most of them valued the education of their children and often read books related to child-rearing, thus creating favorable conditions for their children's healthy growth. Among the parents of ordinary children, one-third had a high school education or higher, but most parents did not know how to educate their children. Therefore, regardless of educational background, parents should learn scientific child-rearing methods.

　　上海医学专家调查发现
　　家庭环境对儿童影响大
　　优化家庭环境关键是提高父母素质
    据新华社上海11月23日电　（记者刘军）著名儿科专家、上海医科大学教授刘湘云及其指导的研究生华健，经过两年对128名“健优儿童”与128名一般儿童的家庭环境进行对照调查发现，儿童发展的差异在很大程度上取决于家庭环境，而优化家庭环境的着眼点是提高父母素质。
    这128名“健优儿童”是1987年从上海全市范围内严格评选出来的4至6岁幼儿。按同年龄、同性别、同幼儿园、同班级的要求，以1∶1的比例抽取了128名一般儿童作为对照，然后分析这两组生活在相同社会环境中的儿童的身心差异及其原因。刘湘云教授告诉记者：虽然父母素养并不能完全代表家庭环境，但是确实主宰着家庭的各个方面，因此优化家庭环境的主要着眼点是提高父母素质。
    调查统计发现，文化程度高的父母所生孩子不一定优于父母文化程度低的孩子。“健优儿童”的父母中有1／3没有上过高中，但他们中的绝大多数人都重视对子女的教育，并能经常阅读有关儿童教养的书籍，从而为子女健康成长创造了有利条件。而一般儿童的父母中1／3具有高中以上文化程度，但多数家长不知道应该怎样教育子女。因此，不管文化程度高低，父母都应该学习科学育儿的方法。
