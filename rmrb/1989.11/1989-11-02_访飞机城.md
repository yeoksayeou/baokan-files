Dear readers, in your memory, you may recall such a series of impressive records of the republic's achievements: Jilin Changchun has an automobile city, Heilongjiang Daqing has an oil city, Gansu Jiuquan has a satellite city... Please do not forget, in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, there is also an aircraft city.

On November 2, 1948, the gunpowder smoke of the liberation of Shenyang had not yet dissipated, and a unit known as the "Lu Ban Army" of workers and peasants' children hurried to the "Beiling Airport" north of the tomb of Qing Taizu Emperor Hong Taiji. When they stepped onto the iron suspension bridge leading to the airport, they were stunned by the desolate scene: on the factory ruins, clumps of withered yellow weeds trembled in the cold wind; thick steel beams twisted into corkscrew shapes, protruding from the collapsed factory buildings with rusty bodies; in the drafty aircraft hangars, several military aircraft lay scattered, missing limbs and with sunken bellies...

The soldiers exchanged glances and then took off their yellow cotton jackets, using ropes to pull and shoulders to carry, gathering the aircraft wreckage on the airfield. Then, they picked up buckets of paste and went to post recruitment advertisements on the streets and alleys. Soon, the sound of hammering echoed through the factory, and a small repair shop with just over 200 people began operations. In just over a year, they managed to repair 36 American-made fighter planes.

This was the scene of the Shenyang Aircraft Manufacturing Company's founding 40 years ago, the largest fighter jet manufacturing base in the republic.

On June 25, 1950, the Korean War broke out. To curb the spread of the war of aggression, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army went to Korea to fight. The Shenyang Aircraft Factory became the rear base for the air force fighting in Korea. Once, the factory received an urgent task to manufacture 3,000 auxiliary fuel tanks. In the absence of blueprints and equipment, with only a pair of Soviet-made auxiliary fuel tanks as samples, factory director Xiong Yan led everyone to successfully manufacture over 3,000 "homemade" auxiliary fuel tanks using the method of welding "foreign iron pots" in civilian workshops, ensuring the urgent needs of the air force. Air force combat hero Wang Hai flew a fighter plane assembled by the Shenyang Aircraft Factory, with these "homemade" auxiliary fuel tanks under its wings, and shot down 9 enemy planes. In nearly three years of the Korean War, our volunteers shot down or damaged over 12,200 enemy planes, and half of the medals should go to the Shenyang Aircraft Factory!

In December 1952, Premier Zhou Enlai, based on the situation of China's aviation industry, decisively proposed a development strategy suitable for China's national conditions: "first repair, then manufacture, and then design and manufacture independently." Soon, the Shenyang Aircraft Factory was listed as one of the 156 key projects for the first Five-Year Plan period with Soviet aid. The construction army arrived. The roar of machines suddenly echoed in the wilderness. Concrete roads crisscrossed, and giant factory buildings rose from the ground... The Shenyang Aircraft Factory, which started as a small repair shop relying on manual methods, grew rapidly into China's largest aircraft manufacturing plant!

On July 19, 1956, the first jet fighter made in the republic was born in this factory, ending the history of China not being able to produce fighter planes. Marshal Nie Rongzhen, upon hearing the news, hurried from Beijing to personally cut the ribbon for the first plane. In October of the same year, four fighter planes made by this factory flew over Tiananmen Square in Beijing in formation, marking the first public display of Chinese-made planes. At that moment, Chairman Mao Zedong stood on the Tiananmen Gate Tower, pointing to the jet fighters flying overhead and proudly telling the foreign friends beside him, "Our own planes are flying over!" At that time, only a few countries like the United States and the Soviet Union had just broken through the "sound barrier" technology, and young republic suddenly joined this enviable "minority." The air force used the jet fighters made by this factory to shoot down 9 invading enemy planes in 1958 alone. The national prestige soared!

In May 1964, the first ground-to-air missile of the republic was also successfully manufactured in this factory, becoming the "sword" to defend the republic's territory.

In the early 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union successively developed new types of fighter planes, and the Chinese people also put in a lot of effort. On June 25, 1964, Deng Xiaoping, Li Fuchun, Bo Yibo, and other central leaders came to the Shenyang Aircraft Factory to inspect the work. When the factory leaders asked Comrade Deng Xiaoping for instructions on the factory's development, Deng Xiaoping humorously said, "No instructions, just hope! Hope to develop a new type of fighter plane within three years." The entire factory was invigorated, and everyone was full of energy, striving to overcome difficulties. On January 17, 1966, the long-awaited new type of aircraft—the domestically produced J-7 fighter plane—was born.

In the tide of reform, the aircraft city has added a vibrant atmosphere.

In September 1986, at the 27th Farnborough International Airshow in the UK, the model of the J-8II fighter plane made by the Shenyang Aircraft Manufacturing Company, with its slender body, smooth lines, and excellent performance, amazed the world's aviation experts. This was the first public appearance of a new type of fighter plane independently designed and manufactured by China. Foreign media commented: "Its birth marks the complete departure of China's fighter planes from the traditional Mig series, entering a new stage of development..." Suddenly, the praise of the "sky gentleman" spread worldwide.

Premier Zhou Enlai's wish for China's aviation industry to "first repair, then manufacture, and then design and manufacture independently" has finally been realized. The aviation dreams of countless Chinese men have finally become a reality.

24 years ago, Huang Zhiquan, deputy director of the Shenyang Aircraft Design Institute, took on the heavy responsibility of developing China's own fighter planes and went abroad for inspection. However, due to an airplane crash, his remains were forever left in an unnamed valley near the ancient pyramids in Egypt. He was one of the founders of China's independently designed aircraft.

23 years ago, Gao Fangqi, chief engineer of the Shenyang Aircraft Manufacturing Factory, worked diligently year after year to manufacture China's independently designed fighter planes. Eventually, he collapsed on the aircraft production site due to overwork. On his deathbed, he held the hands of the factory leaders and gasped, "You must... develop the J-8 well..."

The tragic achievements of the pioneers inspired the cadres and workers to strive for success. Six years ago, General Manager Tang Qian and his assistants, with astonishing courage, signed a "military order" with the highest leader of the Aviation Industry Department: to send the J-8II into the sky in the shortest possible time! During production, he insisted on combining research and development with production, fully mobilizing the factory and institute's strengths, using computer-aided design and manufacturing and other new technologies, and implementing a comprehensive technical and economic contract for all 7 systems in the company. As a result, a miracle happened. The birth of the J-8II created the best example of the shortest research and development cycle and the highest quality in the history of China's aviation industry. The air force leaders called it: "A miracle!"

With the deepening of economic reforms, the aircraft city is no longer just a large military-industrial enterprise proud of manufacturing fighter planes. Today, it has become a production base for 5 major series and over 200 types of civilian products, including aviation products, automobiles, large and medium-sized machinery, light metal structures, and household appliances. 16 of its products have won national gold and silver quality awards and departmental and provincial excellent product awards. To open up the international market, the Shenyang Aircraft Manufacturing Company has successively established trade relations with Boeing, Lockheed, Aerospace, and 8 other world-renowned aviation companies in the United States, Britain, Germany, and 6 other countries. The mechanical and electrical products it produces are exported overseas.

    访飞机城
    刘智慧　孙荣轩
    亲爱的读者，在你的记忆中，或许铭刻着这样一串令人钦佩的共和国之最：吉林长春有个汽车城、黑龙江大庆有个石油城、甘肃酒泉有个卫星城……请不要忘记，在辽宁省沈阳市，还有一座飞机城。
    （一）
    1948年11月2日，解放沈阳的炮火硝烟还没有消失，一支名为“鲁班部队”的工农子弟兵，匆匆赶到清太宗皇太极陵寝北侧的“北陵机场”。当他们一踏上通往机场的铁吊桥，便被满目疮痍的景象惊呆了：厂区废墟上，一窝窝枯黄的蒿草在寒风中颤抖着，粗壮的钢梁拧着麻花状从塌坍的厂房中探出锈斑的身躯；四壁透风的飞机库中，横七竖八地趴着几架缺胳膊少腿、瘪肚子的军用飞机……
    军人们只相觑了一刻，便甩掉黄棉袄，用绳子拽，用肩头扛，把机场上的飞机残骸搜集到一块儿，然后纷纷拎着浆糊桶，到大街小巷张贴招工广告去了。不久，厂房中“叮叮、咚咚”传出铁锤的敲击声，一个仅有200多人的小修理厂开工了。仅一年多的时间，他们竟修好了36架美制战斗机。
    这就是共和国最大的歼击机制造基地——沈阳飞机制造公司40年前创业的一幕。
    1950年6月25日，朝鲜战争爆发了。为了扼制侵略战争的蔓延，中国人民志愿军赴朝参战。沈阳飞机厂成为赴朝参战空军的后方基地。有一次，工厂接到制造3000个副油箱的紧急任务。在一无图纸、二无设备，只有一对苏制副油箱作实样的情况下，厂长熊焰领着大家用民间焊“洋铁壶”的方法成功地制造了3000多个“土”副油箱，及时保证了空军急需。空军战斗英雄王海就是驾驶着沈阳飞机厂组装的战斗机，机翼下挂着这种“土”副油箱，一共击落9架敌机。在近三年的抗美援朝战争中，我志愿军共击落、击伤敌机12200余架，军功章应该有沈阳飞机厂的一半哟！
    1952年12月，周恩来总理根据中国航空工业的状况，果断地提出了适合我国国情的“先修理后制造，再自行设计制造”的发展战略。不久，沈阳飞机厂被国家列为第一个五年计划期间苏联援建的156项重点工程之一。建设大军开来了。旷野里机器的轰鸣声蓦然响起。一条条水泥板路纵横交错，一座座巨型厂房拔地而起……沈阳飞机厂从一个仅靠手工方法修理飞机的小型工厂，日新月异地成长为我国最大的飞机制造厂！
    （二）
    1956年7月19日，共和国制造的第一架喷气式歼击机在这个工厂中诞生了，中国人不能造歼击机的历史结束了。聂荣臻元帅听到这个消息后，兴冲冲地专程从北京赶来为第一架飞机剪了彩。同年10月1日，这个工厂制造的四架歼击机列队飞过北京天安门上空，这是中国制造的飞机第一次公开展露雄姿。此刻，毛泽东主席站在天安门城楼上，指着飞掠而过的喷气式歼击机自豪地对身边的外国朋友说：“我们自己的飞机飞过去了！”当时，世界上刚刚突破“音障”技术难关不久，能够制造超音速歼击机的仅有美国、苏联等少数国家，而年轻的共和国蓦地闯进了这令人羡慕的“少数”之中。空军用这个工厂制造的喷气式歼击机，仅在1958年一年中就击落入侵我国领空的敌机9架。国威大振！
    1964年5月，共和国的第一枚地空导弹又在这个工厂中制造成功，成为捍卫共和国领土的“利剑”。
    60年代初期，美国、苏联相继研制出了新型战斗机，中国人民也憋足了一股劲。1964年6月25日，邓小平、李富春、薄一波等中央领导又来到沈阳飞机厂视察工作。当厂领导请邓小平总书记对工厂的发展作指示时，邓小平风趣地说：“没有什么指示，有希望！希望三年内把新型歼击机搞出来。”全厂为此而振奋，人人抖擞精神，奋力攻关。1966年1月17日，空军盼望已久的新型机种——国产歼7飞机诞生了。
    （三）
    在时代改革大潮中，飞机城增添了盎然生机。
    1986年9月，在英国第27届范堡罗国际航空博览会上，沈阳飞机制造公司制造的歼8Ⅱ战斗机模型，以颀长的身躯、流畅的线条、精良的性能，引起世界航空界人士的惊叹。这是中国自行设计制造的新型战斗机，第一次公开露面。外电是这样评价的：“它的诞生，标志着中国歼击机的发展彻底脱离了传统米格系列，进入新的发展阶段……”顿时，“空中美男子”的赞誉飞扬天下。
    周恩来总理生前对中国航空工业“先修理后制造，再自行设计制造”的遗愿终于实现了。中国多少热血男儿的航空梦，终于变为现实了。
    24年前，沈阳飞机设计所副所长黄志千，为了研制出我国自己的歼击机，身负重任出国考察，但由于所乘坐的飞机失事，他的尸骨永远留在埃及古金字塔旁一个无名山谷中。他是我国自行设计飞机的奠基人之一。
    23年前，沈阳飞机制造厂的总工程师高方启，为了制造出我国自行设计的歼击机，兢兢业业，年复一年，最后积劳成疾，竟瘫倒在飞机生产现场。弥留之际，他拉着厂领导的手断断续续地倾吐遗愿：“一定……要……搞好歼8……”
    先驱们悲壮的业绩，激励着干部、职工成就事业的拳拳之心。六年前，公司总经理唐乾三和他的助手们以惊人的胆魂，同航空工业部最高领导立下“军令状”：要用最短的时间将歼8Ⅱ送上蓝天！在生产中，他坚持科研与生产相结合，充分调动厂、所的力量，采用计算机辅助设计、制造等新技术，在全公司7个系统实行万人整体技术经济承包。结果，奇迹出现了。歼8Ⅱ的诞生，创造了中国航空工业史上研制周期最短、质量最好的范例。空军领导称之为：“创造了一个奇迹！”
    随着经济改革的深入，飞机城不仅是以制造歼击机引以自豪的大型军工企业了。如今，这里已成为航空产品类、汽车类、大中型机械类、轻金属结构类、民用电器类等5大系列200多种民用产品的生产基地。这里制造的产品，有16项荣获国家质量金、银奖和部、省优质产品奖。为了开拓国际市场，沈阳飞机制造公司先后同美、英、德等6个国家的波音、洛克希德、宇航等8家世界著名航空公司建立了贸易联系，所生产的机电产品远销国外。
