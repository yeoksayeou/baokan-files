    The green mountains bury the loyal bones, how can one forget the journey back to China;
    The green blood of China, stands up a progressive nation.
    The fires of Wutai Mountain, the fierce battles of Motianling,
    The bloody memories, are they truly distant and blurred?
    Can it be said that a box of medical equipment and a saddle,
    Are merely gifts to bid farewell to comrades in war?
    Can it be said that a few eulogies and a couple of statues,
    Are your final resting place in the vast land of China?
    No, we still deeply need you,
    The new enterprise is bright with sunshine, but there are also thick clouds and fog;
    Like radium, it can release boundless light and heat,
    Your spirit—a most precious element.
    Even if you no longer need to worry about medicine,
    We still need your surgical knife, your medical skills,
    To cut out the rotting ulcers, to drain the pus,
    To kill the mold and viruses that invade the soul.
    Faith is not empty talk, not a golden sign!
    Your stern gaze is questioning, recording.
    On the rugged path, you are forever a special sentinel,
    Under the blue sky, forever stands your white coat and silver head.

    白求恩
    顾子欣
    青山埋忠骨，何曾綦念枫国归途；
    碧血中华，站起一个奋进的民族。
    五台山的烽火，摩天岭的激战，
    腥红的记忆当真已遥远而模糊？
    难道说，一箱医械、一副马鞍，
    就聊作馈赠战友永诀的礼物？
    难道说，几篇悼文、二三雕像，
    竟是你在茫茫九州最后的归宿？
    不，我们仍痛切地需要你，
    新事业阳光灿烂，也有浓云密雾；
    如镭一样，能爆发无比光热，
    你的精神——一种最宝贵的元素。
    纵然再不必为药剂操神，
    却仍需你的手术刀、你的医术，
    为割除腐烂的溃疡，排去脓血，
    为杀灭侵入灵魂的霉菌和病毒。
    信仰岂是空谈，岂是描金招牌！
    你冷峻的目光在拷问，在记录。
    雄关漫道上，你永是一名特种哨兵，
    蓝天下，永映出你皑皑白衣苍苍头颅。
