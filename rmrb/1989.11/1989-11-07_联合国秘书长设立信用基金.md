United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced today the establishment of a Secretary-General's Credit Fund to assist countries that resolve disputes through the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

The Secretary-General said the purpose of establishing the fund is to provide necessary financial assistance to countries that need to resolve their disputes through the International Court of Justice.

He said the fund will be raised through voluntary donations. He hopes to receive contributions from various countries, official and non-official organizations, individuals, and groups.

Perez de Cuellar said there are only two situations in which assistance can be considered. The first is when the parties involved jointly submit the dispute to the court for arbitration. The second is when both parties are willing to execute the court's judgment, but one or both parties lack the funds or technical means to do so.

The Secretary-General said, to ensure fairness, he plans to establish a committee of three senior experts to review requests for assistance and to keep the assistance strictly confidential.

    联合国秘书长设立信用基金
    新华社联合国11月1日电  联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天宣布设立秘书长信用基金，以援助那些通过海牙国际法院解决纷争的国家。
    秘书长说，设立基金会的目的是使那些需要通过国际法院解决分歧的国家得到必要的财政援助，以解决它们之间的分歧。
    他说，这项基金将通过自愿捐助筹集。他希望能得到各个国家、官方及非官方组织、个人及团体的捐助。
    佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔说，只有两类情况可以考虑给予援助。第一类情况是有关各方共同将纷争提交给法院仲裁；第二类情况是，双方都准备执行法院的判决，但其中一方或双方因缺资金或缺技术而不能执行法院判决。
    秘书长说，为确保公正起见，他打算建立一个由三位高级专家组成的小组来审查要求援助的申请，并且对援助严格保密。
