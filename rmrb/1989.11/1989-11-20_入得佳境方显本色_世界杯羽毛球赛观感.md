Title: In the Zone to Show True Colors – Reflections on the World Cup Badminton Tournament

There were a few matches in the World Cup Badminton Tournament that truly left spectators in awe.

One was between Yang Yang and the Indonesian star Sugiarto, and another was between Li Yongbo, Tian Bingyi, and the Indonesian pair of Hong Zhongzhong and Guo Hongyuan. The three Chinese players showcased their skills and tactics to the fullest, playing as if they were "on fire." The white shuttlecock would flash across the court, sometimes disappearing at the baseline, sometimes rolling over the net to the ground. It was impossible to hit or retrieve. When the game reached this point, it was truly at its best.

Yang Yang and the pair of Li Yongbo and Tian Bingyi both won with a score of 2:0, and the scores of the two sets were quite different. In terms of skill level, the six players did not have such a large gap. Both Yang Yang and Sugiarto are "kings" of the sport, each with their own unique strengths. The two men's doubles pairs were also evenly matched. So, what caused the gap to widen? The answer is that the former entered the zone, while the latter's performance was subpar and they faltered on the court. The three Chinese players were in their best form, so their skills were fully utilized. Yang Yang's agile footwork and his advantage in combining smashes and drop shots suppressed his opponent's strengths. Li Yongbo and Tian Bingyi's coordination was seamless, with fluid offense and defense, and they moved in and out of position with precision. Therefore, for an athlete, entering the zone is like adding wings to a tiger; being in poor form is like a tiger falling to the ground.

An athlete's on-court performance is a complex issue. How to gradually adjust a player's physical and mental state to an ideal level before a match indeed requires careful consideration. In the past, some of our projects focused too much on training and paid too little attention to adjustments, causing players to perform poorly on the court and suffer consecutive losses. This issue deserves serious attention.

Adjustment is also a science, involving the elimination of fatigue, recovery of strength, enhancement of endurance, and gradual excitement of the spirit. It has both observable phenomena and measurable data. Sports scientists should collaborate with the teams to bring it into a scientific framework. The 11th Asian Games are approaching, and we hope to make breakthroughs in adjustments, allowing more athletes to enter the zone like Yang Yang and a few other warriors in the World Cup Badminton Tournament.

    入得佳境方显本色
    ——世界杯羽毛球赛观感
    世界杯羽毛球赛有几场球真让人叫绝。
    一场是杨阳对印尼名将苏吉亚托，一场是李永波、田秉毅对印尼洪忠中、郭宏源。三名中国选手技术战术发挥得淋漓尽致，简直是打“疯”了。那洁白的羽球，像一道白色的闪光时而消失在底线，时而从网上滚落到地，想击击不到，想救捞不起。球打到这种分上，可谓最佳了。
    杨阳和李永波、田秉毅都是以2∶0击败对手，而且两局比分很悬殊。论水平，这六名选手差距不致于这样大，杨阳和苏吉亚托均是“天王”人物，各有千秋。两对男双更是旗鼓相当。那么，是什么使他们彼此拉大了距离呢？答案是前者进入了佳境，后者状态欠佳，临场失常。中国这3名选手由于处于最佳状态，所以技术得到充分发挥。杨阳的步伐灵活，打吊劈杀结合的优势压住了对手的长处。而李永波、田秉毅又配合得天衣无缝，攻防自如，进退有方。所以对一个选手来说，进入佳境似如虎添翼；状况不佳似虎落平原。
    运动员的临场状态大有文章可做，如何在赛前把选手的身体和心理状态逐渐调整到一个理想的程度，确实需要费一番脑子。以往我们有的项目重视训练多，注意调整少，使选手到了赛场表现失常，连吃败仗，应引起足够的重视。
    调整亦是一门科学，它包括克服疲劳、恢复体力、增强耐力和使精神逐渐兴奋等，既有现象，也有数据可测。体育科研人员应配合运动队把它纳入科学的轨道。现在离第11届亚运会开幕的日子越来越近了，希望在调整上有个突破，让更多的运动员像世界杯羽毛球赛上杨阳等几名战将一样，步入佳境。
