Uruguayan Election Results Announced: Lacalle Elected New President

		BEIJING, Nov. 27 (Xinhua) -- Uruguayan White Party candidate Luis Alberto Lacalle won yesterday's election and was elected as the next president of the republic. Gonzalo Aguirre was elected vice president.

		More than 2 million Uruguayan voters cast their ballots yesterday to elect the next president of the republic, members of the two houses of parliament, and the heads of the capital and various provinces. This was the first time since 1972 that the Uruguayan people voted in a constitutional election. Compared to the 1984 election, which marked the transition from military to civilian government, this election saw a significant increase in the number of participating parties, with 12 presidential candidates from various parties.

		The White Party is one of Uruguay's two major traditional parties, but it has held power infrequently, only three times this century. Lacalle advocates for the partial privatization of state-owned enterprises to improve efficiency. He also supports amending the constitution to increase benefits for retirees, gaining the support of nearly a quarter of the population who are retirees. The election also included a referendum on constitutional amendments, with the provision to increase benefits for retirees passing by a majority.

		Local political analysts believe that the next government will pursue similar policies in domestic and foreign affairs as the current government.

　　乌拉圭大选揭晓
　　拉卡列当选新总统
    本报蒙得维的亚11月27日电　记者李志明报道：乌拉圭白党候选人路易斯·阿尔韦托·拉卡列在昨天举行的大选中获胜，当选为下届共和国总统，贡萨洛·拉基莱当选副总统。
    200多万乌拉圭选民昨天投票选举了下届共和国总统、议会两院和首都及各省首脑。这是1972年以来，乌拉圭人民第一次在宪制下走向投票箱。与1984年那次从军政府向文人政府过渡的大选相比，本次大选参加的政党大为增多，各党提出的总统候选人就有12人。
    白党是乌拉圭两大传统政党之一，但执政次数很少，本世纪只有三次。拉卡列主张对国营企业实行部分私有化，以提高效率。他也赞同修改宪法提高退休人员待遇，得到占人口近1／4的退休人员的支持。本次大选同时进行了关于修改宪法的公民投票，提高退休者待遇的条款获多数通过。
    此间政治分析家认为，下届政府在内政、外交方面将执行与现政府类似的政策。
