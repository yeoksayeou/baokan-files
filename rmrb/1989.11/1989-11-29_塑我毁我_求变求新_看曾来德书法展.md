Title: Mold Me, Destroy Me: Seeking Change and Innovation – Viewing the Calligraphy Exhibition of Zeng Laide

Edition: 8

In his early thirties and having studied calligraphy for less than a decade, the rising star in the calligraphy world, Zeng Laide, held his personal calligraphy exhibition at the China Art Museum on the 14th.

My first encounter with Zeng Laide was at the 1985 International Calligraphy Exhibition in Zhengzhou. His work was also selected for the exhibition. At that time, he gave the impression of a refined and self-confident young military man. He hasn't changed much since then, but his calligraphy skills have improved significantly.

Upon entering the exhibition hall, I was captivated by the vibrant passion and overwhelming vitality that leapt off the paper. At first glance, the author's work covers a wide range of traditional styles: regular script, cursive script, seal script, and clerical script. His works also beautifully capture the elegance of calligraphy and the solemnity of inscriptions, seemingly encompassing everything. Moreover, he has benefited greatly from studying Qin and Han bamboo slips and Jin and Tang scriptures. However, upon closer examination, none of his works appear to be mere imitations. Even the majority of his running cursive script works are free from formulaic "familiar patterns."

Many people believe that to achieve something in the arts, one only needs talent and hard work. They often overlook another crucial factor—psychological qualities. Without good psychological qualities, even talent can fade away, and hard work may be in vain. Although Zeng Laide is young, he possesses a certain "recklessness." He dares to break conventions, has full confidence in himself, and is a person of great courage. Do not underestimate the importance of "courage"; without it, how can artistic creation begin!

Relying on intuition and enlightenment is a distinctive feature of Zeng Laide's creative practice. When learning from excellent works of the past and present, he does not focus on the gains and losses of individual strokes or the mastery of techniques. Instead, he first grasps the overall spirit of the work and understands its artistic conception from a spiritual perspective. "Copying a script a hundred times, and its meaning will naturally appear," he believes, is a great misunderstanding. "Mastery leading to naturalness" is no longer a profound truth. Based on a certain level of skill, he emphasizes "reading" and focuses on "enlightenment." He once said that reading scripts has two major advantages: freedom of advancement and retreat, and the ability to enter a higher level of thinking. It can form an overall impression of a particular style, script, and the entire tradition through the spatial transmission between the brain, eyes, and script. Combined with the interpretation in practice, one can sometimes easily interweave between ancient, contemporary, and personal styles, forming a multi-dimensional and vast realm. If you look at his many works, you can feel the profound insights within.

A strong creative consciousness is another advantage of Zeng Laide's calligraphy. In fact, the core of traditional art is the spirit of creation. He has a sense of mission for the career he pursues. He frankly states: "Art, if it separates from new explorations and breakthroughs, will only follow the paths of predecessors step by step, inevitably becoming monotonous and dull, and inevitably each generation will be inferior to the last." Based on this, he wrote the motto "Mold Me, Destroy Me," striving to make each work seek change and innovation. If one lacks the courage to transcend oneself, perhaps one would not dare to make this difficult choice.

There is no doubt that Zeng Laide's current works also have some shortcomings. The vigorous strokes caused by the special characteristics of the wolf-hair brush sometimes make people feel that there is more unrestrainedness than substance. The overly exposed lines at the beginning and turning points of the long-bristled brush also need improvement. How to return to simplicity from complexity, and to contain unrestrainedness within tranquility, reaching a higher realm of "powerful yet not fierce," perhaps is Zeng Laide's next goal.

### 塑我毁我　求变求新——看曾来德书法展

　　塑我毁我　求变求新
　　——看曾来德书法展
　　王镛
    三十出头，学书不足十载的书坛新秀曾来德，于14日在中国美术馆举办了他的个人书法展览。
    初识曾来德，还是在1985年郑州国际书法展览会上。他的作品也入选其中。那时的他，给人的印象是一个文质彬彬、充满自信的青年军人。人至今没有什么变化，不过，在书艺上却是今非昔比了。
    走进展厅，我被那跃然纸上的一派激情和逼人的活力所感染。初看，作者在传统方面涉猎很广：真草隶篆、榜书小楷，以至于帖的流美，碑的凝重，几乎是无所不及。而且从秦汉简牍和晋唐写经中也得益匪浅。但若细细品味，又没有一幅是刻意模仿之作。即使是占了展览中多数的行草书，也很少有那种程式化的“熟套子”。
    许多人以为，要想在艺术上有所作为，凭天才加勤奋就够了。他们往往忽略了另一个重要条件——心理素质。没有良好的心理素质，天才也会逐渐泯灭，勤奋可能劳而无功。曾来德年纪不大，却有几分“狂气”。他敢于冲破常规，对自己有充分信心，是个有胆魄的人。别小看这“胆魄”二字，没有胆魄，艺术创造又从何说起！
    凭感觉，重悟性，是曾来德创作实践的一个特色。在借鉴古今优秀作品时，他不计较点画的得失，不迷信技巧的熟练。而是首先对作品从整体上把握其神采，从精神上领悟其意境。“临帖百遍，其意自见”，在他认为是一大误会。“熟极而自然化出”也再不是什么至理名言。在具备一定技能的基础上，他注重于“读”，立足于“悟”。他曾说，读帖有两大好处，一是进退自由，二是可进入一种高层次的思维活动形式。它可以通过大脑、眼睛、字帖三者之间的空间传递，形成一个对某家、某帖及整个传统的总体印象。再结合实践中的阐发，有时就轻松地穿插在古人、时人、自身之间，形成一个多维的广阔天地。如果看了他的诸多作品，你可以感受到其中的妙谛。
    创造意识强烈，是曾来德书法的又一优势。其实，传统艺术的核心，就是创造精神。他对自己所从事的事业有一种使命感。对此，他直言不讳：“艺术，如果离开新的探索、开拓，只会按照前人的路子亦步亦趋，必然会单调乏味，而且必然会一代不如一代。”基于此，他写下了“塑我毁我”的座右铭，力图使每幅作品求变求新。如果缺乏超越自我的勇气，恐怕也不敢做出这一艰难的选择。
    无庸质疑，眼下曾来德的作品也有不尽如人意之处。特长锋羊毫所造成的奔突笔势，有时会使人感到恣肆有余而内涵不足。长锋笔起始转折处带来的线条过分刻露，也有待于完善。如何能归繁褥于平淡，寓奔放于虚和，达到“威而不猛”的更高境界，或许是曾来德已意识到的下一个目标了吧。
