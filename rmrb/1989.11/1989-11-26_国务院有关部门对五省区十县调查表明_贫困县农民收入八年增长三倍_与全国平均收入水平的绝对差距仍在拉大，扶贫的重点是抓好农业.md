    A recent survey by relevant departments of the State Council on 10 counties in five provinces and autonomous regions has shown that from 1980 to 1988, the per capita income of farmers in these poor counties grew significantly faster than the national average. While the relative gap with the national average has narrowed, the absolute gap continues to widen. The focus of poverty alleviation should be on agriculture.

    The reporter Chen Jian reports: Recently, the Office of the Leading Group for Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas under the State Council conducted systematic surveys in 10 key poverty-stricken counties in Sichuan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, and Qinghai. The results show that the per capita net income of farmers in these 10 counties increased from 64 yuan in 1980 to 256 yuan in 1988, a threefold increase over eight years, with an average annual growth rate of 19%. In the same period, the national average annual growth rate was 14%. In 1980, the per capita net income of farmers in these 10 counties was only 34% of the national average, but by 1988, this figure had risen to 47%, significantly narrowing the relative gap. However, the absolute gap continues to widen. In 1980, the per capita net income of farmers in these 10 counties was 127 yuan less than the national average, but by 1988, this gap had widened to 289 yuan.

    The survey also revealed that fluctuations in the income of farmers in poor counties are mainly related to fluctuations in agricultural production, with no clear direct relationship with the speed of industrial development. The general trend is that counties with faster agricultural growth also see faster growth in farmers' income; when agricultural production growth slows down, farmers' income growth also slows down. Therefore, the person in charge of this survey believes: Paying more attention to the development and prosperity of agriculture in poverty-stricken areas is of fundamental significance to rural development. Agriculture is the basic premise of poverty alleviation.

    国务院有关部门对五省区十县调查表明
    贫困县农民收入八年增长三倍
    与全国平均收入水平的绝对差距仍在拉大，扶贫的重点是抓好农业
    本报讯　记者陈健报道：有关部门最近对国家重点扶持的10个贫困县的调查表明，1980—1988年，这些县农民的人均收入增长速度，显著高于全国平均水平；与全国平均水平的相对差距逐步缩小，但绝对差距仍在扩大。
    今年以来，国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组办公室先后对四川、广西、贵州、内蒙古和青海五省区的10个国家重点扶持的贫困县进行了系统调查。结果表明，这10个县的农民人均纯收入从1980年的64元增加到1988年的256元，8年增长了3倍，平均每年递增19％，而同期的全国平均递增水平是14％。1980年，10县农民人均纯收入只相当于全国平均水平的34％，而1988年这个指标提高到了47％，相对差距明显缩小。但是，绝对差距仍在扩大。1980年，10县农民人均纯收入与全国平均水平相差127元，1988年相差289元。
    这项调查还显示，贫困县农民收入水平的涨落，主要与农业生产的涨落相关，而与工业发展速度无明显的直接关系。总的趋势是农业增长快的县，农民收入增长也较快；当农业生产的增长放慢时，农民收入的增长也放慢。所以，主持该项调查的负责人认为：在贫困地区更加注重农业的发展和繁荣，对乡村发展有着根本的意义。抓好农业是扶贫的基本前提。
