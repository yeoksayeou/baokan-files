At the end of 1986, only 5 products from Shanggang No. 5 Plant had entered the international market, with a mere 10% compliance rate with international standards. In just two years, their compliance rate with international standards soared to 58.19%, with 5 products reaching international advanced levels and 18 products entering the international market. Currently, Shanggang No. 5 Plant has 31 products produced according to international standards and advanced international standards.

International Advanced Standards Are Achievable

In 1981, the anchor chain steel produced by Shanggang No. 5 Plant began to be exported overseas, receiving positive feedback from users, but it did not yet meet international standards.

At that time, the leading brand for anchor chain steel in the international market was the British Lloyd's Register of Shipping. The leadership of Shanggang No. 5 Plant led a team of technicians to visit Lloyd's Register of Shipping. Later, they invited experts from Lloyd's to inspect the plant's equipment and production processes. The experts suggested three key points: first, produce according to Lloyd's specifications; second, meet the technical and equipment requirements for producing Lloyd's anchor chain steel; third, implement scientific management.

Shanggang No. 5 Plant carefully analyzed the composition and internal quality of Lloyd's anchor chain steel and introduced necessary equipment. After extensive efforts, their anchor chain steel finally received multiple recognitions from Lloyd's. By the early 1980s, Shanggang No. 5 Plant's anchor chain steel had reached the world's advanced level.

The quality of bearing steel is a crucial indicator of a country's metallurgical technology. The international brand leader for bearing steel is Sweden's SKF—DN33. Factory Director Hou Shuting organized a team to compare their products with the Swedish brand to identify gaps. To improve the purity of bearing steel, they introduced foreign equipment and built an HB-40 vacuum refining furnace. During the construction, they studied all domestic and international vacuum refining and vacuum degassing equipment, ultimately building a multifunctional LJ external vacuum refining furnace. With meticulous technology, product quality improved rapidly. The Swedish SKF company evaluated Shanggang No. 5 Plant's bearing steel as having low impurities and being satisfactory. The American Mogul subsidiary compared Shanggang No. 5 Plant's bearing steel with the American SAE52100 and found that the fatigue life of Shanggang No. 5 Plant's bearing steel was 1.26 times higher.

Citizen's Duty and Master's Attitude

New products are constantly emerging. To produce first-class products, one needs first-class equipment. Shanggang No. 5 Plant simultaneously upgraded old equipment and introduced new equipment.

Hou Shuting is a very meticulous person, especially when it comes to procurement.

A 2000-ton high-speed forging press purchased from a renowned company had a load capacity of only 60% upon installation. The purchase of this equipment cost 5 million US dollars. Hou Shuting organized a team to inspect it and discovered fine cracks on the main shaft. Although the cracks were fine, the potential hazard was significant. Hou Shuting firmly demanded compensation. Some colleagues said that demanding compensation would hurt the feelings of the foreign business partners. Hou Shuting, however, said: "This is about fulfilling the contract and protecting the national interest, which is the duty of a citizen." After sending the demand for compensation to the company, the foreign experts working in Shanghai were dispatched to inspect. The expert reported back: "Whether using Chinese standards or international standards, the main shaft of this equipment is not up to par." The company then sent personnel to repair the main shaft and compensated 7 million Marks. Within 10 months, they shipped 130 tons of new main shafts, while the original main shafts were donated to Shanggang No. 5 Plant. Similar incidents occurred frequently.

During the construction of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, 90 tons of high-purity titanium tubes were needed, with each ton valued at 120,000 yuan. Shanggang No. 5 Plant took the initiative to undertake this production task. However, people were not confident and introduced the latest technologies for smelting high-purity titanium from some advanced countries. A representative from the Nuclear Industry Department came to the plant for discussions. Hou Shuting confidently stated: "We can smelt it!" During the smelting process, if foreign exchange was overspent, they would willingly compensate; if foreign exchange was saved, it would all be turned over. In reality, Hou Shuting simply wanted the plant to contribute to the country's nuclear power industry. Half a year later, high-purity titanium ingots were smelted. After being inspected by domestic and foreign experts, they were found to be completely qualified. Before this, 20 titanium tubes were imported from abroad, but none of them met the standards. Many people admired Hou Shuting and the workers of Shanggang No. 5 Plant, saying: "Work should be done this way, and people should be like this."

A Solid Foundation Makes Things Easier

Last year, due to price increases, Shanggang No. 5 Plant incurred economic losses of over 20 million yuan, but the plant's profits and taxes reached 3.02 billion yuan, a 30.7% increase from the previous year.

When asked by the reporter about the reasons for the plant's sustained economic growth, Hou Shuting replied: "There are multiple reasons, but the key is to build a solid foundation. Once the foundation is solid, things become easier."

To improve the international standards of their products, since 1986, they have focused on building a solid foundation. First, they set standards by aiming for international levels; second, they revised the existing 22 volumes of process regulations item by item around this standard; third, they timely collected and exchanged information. In the past two years, they have trained all 4,200 team leaders in batches, ensuring that their management and technical levels meet new requirements.

The No. 2 Rolling Mill of Shanggang No. 5 Plant has a solid foundation. Regardless of the difficulties, production has always been steadily increasing, from the original designed capacity of 1.6 million tons to 14.3 million tons, leading in the three main indicators of output, quality, and consumption for many years. The workers of the No. 1 Rolling Mill have now reached the fifth generation, and the leadership of the grassroots work, despite differences in personality, has firmly maintained the tradition of hard work and strict requirements.

Strict Supervision Ensures High Quality

Implementing international advanced standards for products is crucial for quality.

Currently, Shanggang No. 5 Plant has established 20 guarantee systems for excellent products. For key production processes, they implement a reward system with nameplates to strengthen quality supervision. In the past two years, they have reaffirmed 26 supervision systems. Products leaving the factory undergo a "three-level inspection system" of self-inspection by the team, re-inspection by the quality supervision station, and spot checks by the factory, strictly controlling quality.

The plant has also formed a "quality veto" system from the bottom up. Last year, there was one complete veto and 18 partial vetos, deducting over 10,000 yuan in bonuses.

More notably, the plant's supervision of product quality is strict, and the supervision of people is even stricter, especially for leaders. At the end of 1986, when the reporter visited, the plant's rectification was about to conclude, but the party branch where the leaders were located still needed supplementary classes. At that time, the reporter asked Hou Shuting about the reason why the party branch where the leaders were located did not pass the rectification. Hou Shuting said: "For us leaders' party branch, mistakes must not be concealed. The masses dare to expose mistakes, and leaders dare to correct mistakes, which gives the masses confidence."

The deputy director of the office, Jiang Tongfa, showed a form to the reporter. This form was for the masses to evaluate the leaders. Its contents included the leaders' sense of duty, organizational discipline, democratic style, professional level, etc. Hou Shuting scored full marks in 10 out of 12 evaluations. However, Hou Shuting did not score well in organizational coordination and delegation of authority. Jiang Tongfa said: "Every leader's evaluation should be made public. This way, it not only increases the mutual understanding between leaders and the masses but also makes the masses feel that they have the position and power of masters."

The Emotions of the Workers and the Three Accounts

Factory Director Hou Shuting was directly elected from among the workers. He told the reporter: "The factory director's work on ideological and political issues is very important. Our plant's ideological and political work is led by the leadership and deepens level by level."

This spring, with the rise in prices and the decline in production, the workers' emotions were unstable. The Party Committee and the workers, together, looked at the achievements from the perspective of the grand historical background of 10 years of reform, carefully calculating three accounts: first, the account of workers' income growth over 10 years; second, the account of household goods growth over 10 years; third, the account of Shanggang No. 5 Plant's development over 10 years. These three accounts convinced the workers. From this, the idea of "the plant prospers, I prosper; the plant declines, I suffer" emerged, achieving clarity, dispelling grievances, and inspiring enthusiasm for another struggle.

Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, Sha Yuanfu, told the reporter that ideological and political work should closely follow production and economic activities, timely solving problems of understanding, respecting, and caring for people. To solve the workers' ideological problems, home visits were conducted, and workers' problems were actively solved, achieving a 96% attendance rate and increasing the number of excellent workers.

On the "July 1st" Party's birthday, Shanggang No. 5 Plant organized a day of voluntary labor by Party and Youth League members. In daily production, Party and Youth League members also played a model and leading role everywhere. This influenced and motivated the workers to contribute ideas for improving the quantity and quality of products.

Last year, the entire plant's workers proposed 7,486 rationalization suggestions, with 1,314 being adopted, achieving an economic benefit of 12.5 million yuan. For example, to achieve economic growth, workers proposed methods such as compensating for electric furnace losses with converter compensation, compensating for high-grade material losses with common material compensation, compensating for economic losses with multiple varieties, and compensating for steelmaking losses with processing. They united to overcome difficulties. In the face of difficulties, the factory director and representatives from various units signed responsibility contracts, sharing risks and benefits, and working together to address the 8 key production and operation issues and the 8 major welfare issues that workers care about, uniting to form a single rope.

  “上五”雄风
  本报记者　陈勇进
  1986年底，上钢五厂才有5种产品进入国际市场，国际标准达标率只有10％。仅仅两年，他们的产品国际标准达标率上升到58.19％，其中5种达到国际先进水平，18种产品进入国际市场。现在，上钢五厂已有31种产品采用国际标准和国际先进标准生产。
　　国际先进标准是可以达到的
    1981年，上钢五厂生产的锚链钢开始出口国外，产品得到用户好评，但还达不到国际标准。
      当时，国际标准的锚链钢名牌厂家，是英国的劳氏船级社。上钢五厂的领导率领技术人员访问劳氏船级社。之后，又把对方的专家请来，考察上钢五厂的设备和生产过程。专家提出：要达到劳氏船社锚链钢的标准，一是按劳氏船社的规范生产；二是从工艺到装备条件，要取得劳氏锚链钢生产的资格；三是管理必须科学化。
    上钢五厂仔细分析了劳氏船社锚链钢的成分和内在质量，引进必要的设备。经过多方努力，他们生产的锚链钢，终于得到这家船级社的多次认可。上钢五厂的锚链钢达到了80年代初世界的先进水平。
    轴承钢质量的优劣，是一个国家冶金技术水平的重要标志之一。这种钢国际的名牌是瑞典的SKF—DN33。厂长侯树庭组织一班人，对照瑞典名牌找本厂产品的差距。为了提高轴承钢的纯洁度，引进了国外的设备，建造了HB—40真空精炼炉。在建炉中，他们几乎研究了国内外所有真空精炼和真空脱气设备，建成了多功能LJ炉外真空精炼炉。技术精益求精，产品质量迅速提高。瑞典SKF公司对上钢五厂轴承钢的评价是：轴承钢夹杂物低，令人满意。美国莫果尔分公司将上钢五厂的轴承钢与美国的SAE52100进行寿命对比，发现上钢五厂轴承钢的疲劳寿命要高1.26倍。
              公民职责和主人翁态度
    新产品总是层出不穷的。要生产一流的产品，就要有一流的设备。上钢五厂改造旧设备和引进新设备同时进行。
    侯树庭是很认真的人，在引进问题上，慎之又慎。
    从一家有名望的公司引进的2000吨快速锻压机，安装起来负荷只达60％。购买这套设备花了500万美元。侯树庭组织人验收，发现大轴上有很细的裂纹，裂纹虽细，隐患却大。侯树庭坚决要求索赔。有的同志说，要求索赔会伤了外商的感情。侯树庭却说：这是履行合同，维护国家的利益是公民的职责。要求索赔的电报发到对方公司后，对方让他们正在上海工作的专家前去检查。那位专家检查后，如实地电告本公司：无论用中国的标准，还是世界的标准，这套设备的大轴都是不合格的。这家公司随及派人前来修复大轴并赔偿70万马克。10个月内，又把新的大轴共130吨运来，原来的大轴则无偿地送给了上钢五厂。类似的事情还有不少。
    在秦山核电站建设中，需要90吨高纯度的钛管，当时一吨钛管价值12万元。上钢五厂主动承担这项生产任务。但人们很不放心，并引出一些先进国家冶炼高纯钛的最新技术条件。核工业部的一位同志专程来厂商谈。侯树庭自信地表示：我们可以冶炼！在冶炼中超用外汇，甘愿赔偿；节约了外汇，全部上交。其实侯树庭无非是想让本厂在国家的核电事业中做些贡献。半年后，炼出了高纯度钛锭。经国内外专家鉴定，完全合格。在这之前，从国外进口了20根钛管，谁能想到，却全部不合格。不少人对侯树庭和上钢五厂的职工表示佩服说：“做事要做这样的事，做人要做这样的人。”
            基础牢固了，事情就好办了
    去年物价上涨，上钢五厂经济损失2000多万元，但去年该厂利税却达3.02亿元，比上一年增长30.7％。
    记者问侯树庭，你们厂经济能持续增长原因在哪里？侯树庭回答：原因是多方面的，但关键一条是打好基础。基础牢固了，事情就好办了。
    为了提高产品的国际标准，从1986年起，他们在基础工作建设上，一是瞄准国际水平制定标准；二是围绕这个标准对原有22册工艺规程逐条进行修订；三是及时搜集和交流信息。这两年，又对全厂4200名班组长分批进行了培训，使他们管理和技术水平适应新的需要。
    上钢五厂所属的二轧厂，由于基础工作牢，不管有什么困难，生产总是稳步增长，从原来设计能力的1.6万吨，增长到14.3万吨，在产量、质量、消耗三项主要指标上长年领先。上轧厂职工如今已有五代人了，基层工作的领导，尽管性格各异，那种艰苦奋斗从严要求的风尚，却牢牢地保持着。
                  监督严方能质量高
    推行产品的国际先进标准，关键是质量。
    目前，上钢五厂已建立了20个创优产品的保证体系。对要害生产工序，实行挂牌奖励制，强化质量监督。近两年，重新肯定26项监督制度。产品出厂实行班组自查、质量监督站复查、厂部抽查的“三级检查制”，严把质量关。
    该厂还从下到上形成了“质量否决”体系。去年“全否”一次，部分否决18次，扣除奖金1万多元。
    尤为深刻的是，这个厂对产品质量的监督严，对人的监督也严，而对领导干部的监督更严。1986年底，记者访问时，该厂整党将结束，但厂领导所在的党支部还要补课。当时，记者询问侯树庭领导所在党支部整党未被通过的原因？侯树庭说：对于我们领导人所在的党支部，错误绝对不能掩饰。群众敢于揭露错误，领导人敢于纠正错误，群众就有信心了。
    厂办公室副主任蒋桐发拿出一张表格给记者，这张表格，是对领导干部进行群众性评议的。其内容是领导干部的事业心、组织纪律性、民主作风、业务水平等等。侯树庭在12项评议中，有10项得了满分。但侯树庭在组织协调、用人授权能力上却不够分。蒋桐发说：对每个领导人评议，要公之于众。这样做的结果，既增加了领导干部和广大职工的相互了解，又使职工感到自己有了主人翁地位和权力。
                职工的情绪和三笔账
    厂长侯树庭是直接从职工中选出来的。他对记者说：厂长抓思想政治工作十分重要。我们厂的思想政治工作，是领导先行，一级一级地深化。
    今年春天，物价上涨，生产下降，职工情绪不稳。党委和职工一起，从改革10年的宏大历史背景看问题看成绩，细算三笔账：一算职工10年收入的增长账；二算10年来家庭商品的增长账；三算10年来上钢五厂的发展账。这三笔账算得职工心服口服。由此引伸出厂兴我兴，厂衰我穷的思想，达到明理消气、满怀激情再拚搏。
    党委副书记沙元富对记者说，思想政治工作，要紧密地围绕着生产、经济活动进行，不失时机地做好理解人、尊重人、关心人的工作。为了解决职工的思想问题，开展家庭访问，主动地解决职工的问题，出勤率达到96％，创优的多了。
      “七一”党的生日，上钢五厂开展党团义务劳动日。日常生产中，党团员也处处起模范带头作用。这样，影响、带动职工为提高产品的产量、质量献计献策。
      去年全厂职工提出7486条合理化建议，有1314条被采纳，经济效益达1250万元。如为争取经济爬坡，职工提出电炉损失转炉补，优材损失普材补，效益损失多品种补，炼钢损失加工补的办法，齐心协力共渡难关。困难面前，厂长和各单位代表，还签订了责任合同，风险同担，利益同享的协议，围绕着生产经营的8个难点和职工关心的8大福利问题，上下一心拧成一条绳。
