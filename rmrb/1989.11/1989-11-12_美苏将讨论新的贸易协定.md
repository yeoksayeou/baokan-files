The New York Times reported that the United States and the Soviet Union will hold talks on drafting a new trade agreement.

The U.S.-Soviet Joint Economic Commission meeting, scheduled for November 15, will be attended by delegations led by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Mosbacher and Soviet Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Katyshev.

The New York Times believes that if the U.S. and the Soviet Union reach a new trade agreement, it will normalize economic relations between the two superpowers. This "not only can end the half-century-long trade discrimination between the two countries, but also can lay the foundation for expanding investment and technology transfer."

    美苏将讨论新的贸易协定
    据《纽约时报》报道，美苏两国将就制订新的贸易协定举行会谈。
    将于本月十五日召开的美苏商务联席会议的双方代表团将分别由美国商业部长莫斯巴赫和苏联对外经济联络部长卡图谢夫率领。
    《纽约时报》认为，美苏一旦达成新的贸易协定，将使这两个超级大国的经济关系正常化，这“不仅可以结束两国长达半个世纪的贸易歧视，而且可以为扩大投资和技术转让打下基础。
