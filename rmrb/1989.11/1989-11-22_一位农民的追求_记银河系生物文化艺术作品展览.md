A Unique Exhibition Stirs Beijing

Who would have thought that a farmer would dare to hold a personal exhibition at the Nationalities Cultural Palace in Beijing? Even more surprisingly, this imaginative and innovative "Galaxy Biological Culture Art Exhibition" caused a sensation in the capital.

Upon entering the exhibition hall, the 12 ceramic vases from Tangshan, each representing the changing positions of the constellations by month, immediately caught the attention of many visitors. An official from the Beijing International Sports Exchange Center suggested, "For international sports competitions, we should use these vases as trophies and call them the 'Galaxy Cup'!" In fact, these vases could also be placed in every household, becoming elegant decorations.

There were also 90 Tangshan ceramic plates, each painted with images of the constellations in the galaxy, arranged in sequence according to the constellations. A 7-meter-long and 2-meter-wide draft was displayed, featuring 88 images of the "heavenly kingdoms" in the mind of this farmer. The mural "Galaxy Biological Heavenly Kingdom Wall Painting," made of tiles, was also a marvel. Everything in the exhibition left visitors in awe.

Some experts believe that based on these designs, building ceramics, murals, and decorations for airports, stations, hotels, and tourist facilities can be produced. Carpets, tapestries, textiles, celestial biology calendars, handicrafts, trademarks, stamps, and advertising designs can also be created. All these artistic products and biological patterns combine astronomical knowledge with artistic images, integrating ancient Chinese astronomy with modern astronomy, creating a unique work.

Daring to Explore the Depths of the Galaxy

His name is Cai Baoxuan (also known as Xuanpu), 41 years old, from Gaoguanzhuang Village, Liuguzhuang Township, Xianxi County, Hebei Province. He is a short, sturdy man with a dark red face, a typical man from the eastern part of Hebei. With a primary school education, he is quite skilled in martial arts, especially in the spring and autumn sword techniques. At the press conference in the capital, he spoke in Tangshan dialect to the reporters and guests: "I have been studying astronomy for nearly 20 years. To study ancient Chinese astronomical images, I have gone to the Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanjing three times."

Someone asked, "What is the basis for designing the galaxy biological patterns?" He replied, "Based on Darwin's theory of evolution and inspired by the animal names of the celestial bodies and constellations by the famous Chinese astronomer Zhang Heng, I further studied and designed them based on the laws of the sun, earth, and the North Star. They are divided into three parts: the Northern Celestial Life World Map (from 90 degrees to 40 degrees north latitude of the celestial bodies), the Equatorial Celestial Life World Map (from 0 degrees to 40 degrees north and south latitude of the celestial bodies), and the Southern Celestial Life World Map (from 90 degrees to 40 degrees south latitude of the celestial bodies). The three maps together form a complete celestial sphere life world, with 88 constellations named by Chinese and foreign astronomers, Chinese ancient culture's depiction of 28 constellations, and my imagination of 88 constellations, totaling 126 life images, as well as the depiction of celestial latitude, longitude, ecliptic, equator, and the Milky Way."

"How did you get into astronomy?" a reporter asked.

"Well, it's a long story. Although I only went to primary school, I have a wide range of interests and never stop learning and researching. I have designed reservoirs, written novels, and run a store. My store made a lot of money! If it weren't for reading 'Twenty-Eight Constellations' 20 years ago and getting hooked on astronomy, throwing all my money into it, I would have had tens of millions of assets. But now I still have over 200,000 yuan in debt!" "Villagers say, 'You have money, why throw it away?' I say, what's the use of having money alone? You need an ideal. I want to bring Chinese culture into the international market and compete with foreigners' Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck."

Old Cai seemed delirious, as if talking in his sleep.

Not Seeking Stability but Pursuing an Ideal

More than ten years ago, he had such a dream. He condensed his understanding of the celestial bodies into a design draft of an Eastern-themed celestial amusement park, naming it "New World." At that time, a comrade from the State Tourism Administration responsible for publicity work said, "This is much more characteristic than the amusement parks we currently imitate from foreigners and can be called the 'Eastern Disneyland.' However, it is not easy to realize, as the investment is very large."

Old Cai traveled everywhere, seeking support, but all in vain. Someone advised him, "Don't bother anymore, just live a stable life!" "Just seeking personal stability? I still have to struggle for my ideal."

　　一位农民的追求
　　——记银河系生物文化艺术作品展览
　　高新庆　曹瑞春
    奇特展览动京城
    想不到一个农民敢于在北京民族文化宫举办个人展览。
    更想不到这个想象奇特、构思新颖的“银河系生物文化艺术作品、产品展览”在首都还能引起轰动。
    走进展厅，迎面摆设的12个按月变化的银河系星座方位唐山瓷瓶，吸引了不少观众。北京国际体育交流中心的一位官员说：“举行国际体育竞赛活动，建议就选这瓷瓶作奖杯，叫‘银河杯’！”其实这些瓷瓶还可以进入千家万户，成为高雅的摆设。
    还有那90个绘有银河系星座形象的唐山瓷盘，按银河系星座顺序排列摆设，一幅长7米，宽2米的布稿，上面绘有这位农民心目中88个银河系天国形象，那面构思新巧，由瓷砖烧制的“银河系生物天国壁图”的壁画……无一不令参观者称羡不已。
    一些行家认为，根据这些图案，可以生产建筑陶瓷、壁画，装饰机场、车站、宾馆、旅游设施，还可以生产地毯、挂毯、纺织品、天体生物挂历、工艺美术品、商标、邮票、广告图案等。所有这些艺术产品和生物图案，集天文科学知识与艺术形象于一身，把中国古代天文学与现代天文学融合起来，成为一种独创的作品。
    敢向银河探深浅
    他叫蔡宝轩（又名轩普），41岁，河北省迁西县刘古庄乡高古庄村人，一个矮矮敦敦，黑红脸的冀东汉子。小学文化程度，颇有武功，尤擅春秋刀。在首都新闻发布会上，他操一口唐山方言向记者和来宾侃侃而谈：“我研究天文近20年了。为研究中国古代天文图象，我曾3次去南京紫金山天文台。”
    有人问：“设计银河系生物图案根据在哪里？”他说：“根据达尔文的进化论，并受我国古代著名的天文学家张衡的天体星座和星宿的动物命名启发，我进一步研究，以太阳、地球、北极星三者运行规律中地球天象为依据设计而成。分为北部天体生命世界图（从北极天体90度到40度纬线的天体范围）；赤道天体生命世界图（从天体赤道0度到南北天体40度纬线天体范围）；南部天体生命世界图（从南极天体90度到40度纬线天体范围）。三图合成完整的全天体星球生命世界，上面有88个中外天文学家命名的星座标志，有中国古文化对天体28宿动物形象的描绘和我对88个星座生命的想象，共126幅生命形象的描绘，以及对天体经纬度、黄道、赤道、银河线的描绘。”
      “您咋迷上天文？”有记者问。
      “说来话长。我虽只上过小学，但兴趣广泛，学习、钻研不停，搞过水库设计，写过小说，开过商店。我那商店可来钱呢！要不是20年前，第一次拜读《二十八星宿形象图》，对天文着了迷，把钱都扔在这里面，我也有一二十万的家当了。可如今还背了2万多元的债呢！”“乡亲们说，你有钱咋瞎扔？我说光有钱有啥意思？得有个理想才中。我就想把中国文化打进国际市场，与外国人的米老鼠、唐老鸭比试比试。”老蔡如痴似醉，好像说梦话。
    不图安稳图理想
    10多年前，他就做着这种梦，他把他对天体的认识浓缩在一个东方味十足的天体游乐场的设计草图中，起了个名字叫“新世界”。当时国家旅游局负责宣传工作的一位同志说，这要比我们目前模仿外国而建的游乐场有特色多了，可称得上是“东方迪斯尼乐园”。不过实现不易，投资就很大。
    老蔡四处奔波，寻找支持，但一一落空。有人劝他：“不要折腾了，还是安安稳稳过日子吧！”“光图个人过安稳日子哪中？我还得为我的理想奋斗。”
