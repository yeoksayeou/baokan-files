The United States threatened the United Nations today, stating that if the UN General Assembly attempts to elevate the status of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) through a vote, the U.S. will cease paying its dues to the UN.

Tatwiler, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State, also warned that if the PLO is elected to represent the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and is responsible for providing food aid to Palestinians in occupied territories, the U.S. will stop funding the FAO.

Tatwiler claimed that the U.S. opposes any actions aimed at strengthening the status of the State of Palestine.

Since its establishment in November of last year, the State of Palestine has been recognized by approximately 100 countries worldwide. It is reported that Arab countries are currently in consultations with non-aligned countries and European Community countries, seeking to elevate their status from "observer" to "member state" in the United Nations.

The U.S. is required to pay $216 million in annual dues to the United Nations. Currently, the U.S. owes the United Nations $495 million in unpaid dues. Meanwhile, the U.S. has paid $63 million in dues to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization this year.

　　美国威胁联合国
　　扬言如提高巴解地位就停交会费
    新华社华盛顿11月27日电　美国务院发言人塔特怀勒今天威胁说，如果联大全体会议试图通过表决来提高巴解组织在联合国的观察员地位，美将停止向联合国交纳会费。
    塔特怀勒还警告说，如果巴解组织被推选为联合国粮农组织的代表，负责向被占领土的巴勒斯坦人提供食品救济，美国也将停止向粮农组织提供经费。
    塔特怀勒声称，美国反对任何试图加强巴勒斯坦国地位的行动。
    巴勒斯坦国自去年11月宣布成立以来已得到世界上大约100个国家的承认。据悉，阿拉伯国家正在同不结盟国家和欧共体国家进行协商，要求联大会议将其联合国“观察员”地位提升为“成员国”地位。
    美国每年须向联合国交纳2.16亿美元的会费。目前，美国共拖欠联合国会费4.95亿美元。与此同时，美国今年向联合国粮农组织交纳的经费为6300万美元。
