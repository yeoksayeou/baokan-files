Recently, there have been rumors in Wuhan about a national labor model and female manager of a certain store being arrested for embezzlement and bribery. When the national labor model commendation conference was held, her name appeared in the list of special invitees in the newspaper, which proved the rumors to be groundless. In recent times, there have been some rumors about entrepreneurs in society. Several factory directors and managers discussed this matter and felt that the rumors themselves are not frightening, but what is frightening is why these rumors have a market and why this market is expanding. They believe that there are some misunderstandings about entrepreneurs in society, especially regarding the relationship between entrepreneurs and workers, the basic assessment of the entrepreneurial team, and the views on the distribution of entrepreneurial income, which are diverse and need to be clarified.

"Now that we emphasize relying fully on the working class, do we factory directors and managers count as members of the working class?" This is a sharp question raised by many entrepreneurs. The answer should be affirmative. Of course, here we are mainly talking about the factory directors and managers of state-owned enterprises. Comrade Li Xiannian recently pointed out at the expanded meeting of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "We must fully rely on the working class, including the production workers, management personnel, and engineering and technical personnel of enterprises." Factory directors and managers are management personnel and are naturally members of the working class. The difference between factory directors and managers and production workers is only one of division of labor; they are equal in politics and economics. In the past period, many newspapers and magazines have prominently publicized the role of entrepreneurs, which is also understandable. However, some newspapers and magazines have publicized the role of entrepreneurs in isolation, ignoring or even belittling the role of workers, such as publicizing that "one person saved an enterprise," which is one-sided. Of course, this is more the responsibility of the propagandists and may not be the fault of the entrepreneurs. Now that we emphasize fully relying on the working class, there is no question for entrepreneurs of whether they will be put in a different category. Instead, they should seriously consider how to better rely on workers and mobilize the enthusiasm of workers.

Recently, the media has exposed the problem of some entrepreneurs using their power to embezzle and accept bribes, becoming corrupt and degenerate, which is a matter that must be alert to. However, it is also wrong to regard the entire entrepreneurial team as a mess because of this. It should be pointed out that these people are only a small number in the entrepreneurial team, and the majority of entrepreneurs are good and can stand the test. They are working diligently on various fronts. The economic revitalization, enterprise development, and improvement of the welfare of the majority of employees since the reform and opening up have all been permeated with their efforts. This turmoil, the factories did not get out of control, and the enterprises did not get out of control, which also has their merit.

Social distribution inequality is a social phenomenon that causes dissatisfaction among the masses. In enterprises, a sensitive issue is that due to the implementation of the contract responsibility system, some successful factory directors and managers have obtained some risk income, which belongs to social distribution inequality? This question can be answered with Comrade Jiang Zemin's words in his National Day speech. He pointed out: "The phenomenon of social distribution inequality is mainly reflected in the fact that the income gap between the majority of workers, cadres, and intellectuals who rely on wages and many non-production sector company personnel, and some people engaged in 'second jobs,' especially some private enterprise owners and individual laborers, is too large." Obviously, the risk income of factory directors and managers does not belong to this category. From the actual situation of our country's enterprises, this part of the risk income is also basically a reward and symbolic in nature and does not constitute a large income gap between factory directors and managers and ordinary workers. And for the majority of entrepreneurs, compared to what they take, what they contribute and sacrifice is much greater. Of course, some incomes are indeed too high and should be appropriately addressed, but do not generalize from individual cases.

The entrepreneurial team, which has gradually grown and strengthened over the 10 years of reform and opening up, is part of the working class. They are at the forefront of reform. Especially in today's temporarily difficult situation, they need society's understanding and care. Let us all cherish and support entrepreneurs! Encouraging the best talents to work in enterprises is the hope of our country.

    企业家也是工人阶级的一员
    黄抗生
    前一段，武汉风传一位全国劳动模范、某商场的女经理因贪污受贿被抓了。及至召开全国劳模表彰会，在报纸上看见她的名字列在特邀代表之列，方知是空穴来风。最近一个时期，社会上对企业家有些谣传。几位厂长、经理谈到此事，认为谣言并不可怕，可怕的是这些谣言为什么会有市场，而且这市场还有扩大的趋势。他们觉得现在社会上对企业家有些误解，特别是在企业家与工人的关系，企业家队伍的基本评估，以及企业家的分配收入等问题的看法上，众说纷纭，亟待澄清。
    “现在强调全心全意依靠工人阶级，我们厂长、经理究竟算不算工人阶级的一员？”这是许多企业家提出的一个尖锐问题。回答应当是肯定的，当然这里说的厂长、经理，主要是指公有制企业的厂长、经理。李先念同志最近在全国政协主席扩大会议上指出：“我们要全心全意依靠工人阶级，包括企业的生产工人、经营管理人员和工程技术人员。”厂长、经理属于经营管理人员，理所当然是工人阶级的一员。厂长、经理和生产工人之间，只是分工不同，在政治上、经济上是平等的。过去一段时间许多报刊突出地宣传企业家的作用，这也无可厚非。但是，有的报刊孤立地宣传企业家的作用，忽视甚至贬低工人的作用，如宣传什么“一个人救活了一个企业”，就有失偏颇了。当然，这更多的是宣传工作者的责任，未必是企业家的过错。现在强调全心全意依靠工人阶级，对企业家来说，决不存在一个会不会把自己打入另册的问题，倒是应该认真地考虑一下如何更好地依靠工人，调动工人积极性的问题。
    最近，新闻媒介披露了个别企业家利用职权贪污受贿、腐化堕落的问题，这是必须引起警惕的。但因此把整个企业家队伍看成一团糟，也是不对的。应当指出，这些人在企业家队伍中只是极少数，大多数企业家是好的，是经得起考验的。他们在各条战线上兢兢业业地工作着。改革开放以来经济的振兴，企业的发展，广大职工福利待遇的提高，都渗透着他们的心血。这次动乱，工厂没乱，企业没乱，也有他们的一份功劳。
    社会分配不公，是当前引起群众不满的一种社会现象。在企业，一个敏感的问题就是，由于实行承包制，给一些成功的厂长、经理带来了部分风险收入，这属不属于社会分配不公？对这个问题，可以用江泽民同志在国庆讲话中的话来回答。他指出：社会分配不公的情况，“主要表现在广大靠工资收入的职工、干部、知识分子同许多非生产领域的公司人员之间，同某些从事‘第二职业’者之间，特别是同私营企业主和部分个体劳动者之间，收入的差距过大。”显然，厂长、经理的风险收入不属于这种情况。从我们国家企业的实际情况看，这部分风险收入也基本上是奖励性的、象征性的，并不构成厂长、经理与普通工人收入的过大差距。而对大多数企业家来说，与他们的索取比较起来，他们所作出的奉献和牺牲要大得多。当然，个别的收入确实过多，也要适当解决，但不要把个别当成一般。
    在10年改革开放中逐步成长、壮大起来的企业家队伍，是工人阶级的一部分。他们走在改革的最前列。特别是在今天暂时困难的情况下，他们需要社会的理解和关心。让我们都来爱护和扶持企业家吧！鼓励最优秀的人才，到企业去工作，这是我们国家希望之所在。
