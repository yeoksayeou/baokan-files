The Fourth National Invention Exhibition opened today in Chengdu.

This invention exhibition is organized by the China Invention Association and hosted by the Sichuan Provincial Invention Association.

The exhibition features over 1,000 projects, including 58 youth inventions. These projects were selected and recommended from recent inventions by 40 provinces and municipalities, and 23 national ministries and corporations. They cover 19 professional fields, including machinery, electronics, medicine and health, food, metallurgy, materials, and light industry. Most of the exhibited projects have obtained national patents and invention awards and have participated in various regional (departmental) exhibition and trading fairs, demonstrating high technical levels and practical value.

Over 1,000 inventors, including those from Taiwan, attended the exhibition, directly interacting with audiences and users to discuss business. Among them are inventors from state-owned and collective units, as well as many individual inventors. The inventions range from high-tech to simple and practical ones. For example, the widely used "Eastern Miracle Glue" quick-sealing glue, practical anti-cold perfume, and the soft thumbtack invented by a 7-year-old girl named Meng Yang, have all received attention and praise.

    第四届全国发明展览在蓉开幕
    参展千余项展品有很高实用价值
    本报成都11月3日电　记者罗茂城报道：第四届全国发明展览今天在成都开幕。
    本次发明展览由中国发明协会主办、四川省发明协会承办。
    参加这次展出的项目共1000余项，其中青少年发明58项。这批展出项目是由全国40个省、市，23个国家部委、总公司从近年来的新发明中筛选推荐的，涉及机械、电子、医药卫生、食品、冶金、材料、轻工等19个专业领域。参展项目的大部分获得国家专利和国家发明奖励，并参加过各地区（部门）的展览交易会，有很高的技术水平和实用价值。
    这次展览会共有来自包括台湾在内的1000余名发明者到会，直接与观众、用户见面，洽谈业务。他们中既有国营、集体单位的发明者，也有不少科技发明“个体户”，既有高精尖的发明，也有简单实用的发明。例如，用途广泛、被誉为“东方神胶”的快速堵漏胶，实用的防感冒香水和7岁女孩孟杨发明的软图钉等，均受到人们的重视和好评。
