North Korea Denounces U.S. Provision of Fighter Jets to South Korea

The Korean Central News Agency, on October 31st, released a statement denouncing the United States' decision to supply South Korea with fighter jets.

The statement said that according to foreign news reports, the United States has decided to recently provide South Korea with 120 jet fighter aircraft. Supplying such a large number of fighter jets at once is unprecedented in history. The North cannot ignore the dangers posed by this action.

The statement further said that the United States and South Korea are systematically increasing their military strength, not only creating greater obstacles to peace and peaceful reunification in Korea but also exposing the falsehood of their claims of "peace" and "relaxation." These actions are deliberately creating obstacles for North-South dialogue.

    朝谴责美向南朝鲜提供战机
    朝鲜中央通讯社十月三十一日受权发表声明，谴责美国向南朝鲜提供战斗机。
    声明说，据外电报道，美国决定最近向南朝鲜提供一百二十架喷气式战斗机。一次提供如此大批的战斗机，是历史上所没有过的。对于这一举动的危险性，朝鲜北方绝不能忽视。
    声明说，美国和南朝鲜有系统地增加武装力量，不仅给朝鲜的和平与和平统一造成了更大的障碍，而且表明他们喊的“和平”与“缓和”都是虚伪的，是故意给北南对话制造障碍。
