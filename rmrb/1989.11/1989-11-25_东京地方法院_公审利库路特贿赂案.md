The Tokyo District Court today began the first public trial of the Recruit bribery case.

The Recruit bribery case is the largest scandal in Japan since the end of World War II. The main players in this case are the Recruit Company, which colluded with political and bureaucratic circles, engaging in bribery and receiving bribes, benefiting each other. Since this event was exposed in 1988, it has been revealed that more than 7,000 people are involved in the case, including the then-Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru, former Prime Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro, and other high-ranking government officials. During the investigation of the case, 14 people were arrested, and one person committed suicide, leading to the resignation of the Takeshita cabinet.

The Tokyo Prosecutor's Office conducted an investigation into the case and concluded the investigation on May 29 of this year.

Today, the Tokyo District Court is trying the bribery issue between the Recruit Company and the Ministry of Labor. The main defendants are former Vice-Minister of Labor Kato Takashi and former Vice-President of Recruit Tsukioka Masaru. The court alleges that Tsukioka Masaru sold Recruit Company's unlisted stocks at a low price to Kato Takashi, who then used his authority to benefit the Recruit Company. Tsukioka Masaru denied the stock transfer today, and Kato Takashi stated that he did not know he would benefit from the stocks when he accepted them.

Local public opinion believes that the case involves a wide range of people and is complex. The trial of this case will undoubtedly be a lengthy process.

　　公审利库路特贿赂案
    新华社东京11月24日电　东京地方法院今天开始首次公开审理利库路特贿赂案。
    利库路特贿赂案是日本战后最大的丑闻。此案的主角利库路特公司与政界、官界相勾结，行贿受贿，彼此受益。这一事件自1988年曝光后，现已查清有7000多人涉嫌此案，其中包括当时任首相的竹下登、前首相中曾根，以及政府其他一些要员。在调查利案过程中，有14人被逮捕，1人自杀，竹下内阁被迫辞职。
    东京检察厅对利案进行立案调查，并于今年5月29日结束调查工作。
    东京地方法院今天公审的是利库路特公司和劳动省之间行贿受贿问题。主要被告是劳动省前事务次官加藤孝和利库路特公司前副总经理辰己雅朗。法院方面指控辰己雅朗曾把利库路特公司未上市股票以低价卖给加藤孝，而加藤孝则利用职权为利库路特公司谋利。辰己雅朗今天拒不承认转让股票一事，加藤孝也表示接受股票时不知道后来会受益。
    此间舆论认为，利案涉及面广，且案情复杂，此案的审理工作必将旷日持久。
