The General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party, Nicolae Ceausescu, said in his speech at the closing ceremony of the 14th Congress of the Romanian Communist Party on November 24, "This congress has demonstrated the indestructible unity of the entire Party and the people of the nation, who are determined to continue advancing along the socialist path under the leadership of the Party."

The 14th Congress of the Romanian Communist Party was held in Bucharest from November 20 to 24. More than 3,000 delegates attending the meeting seriously reviewed the work of Romania since the 13th Congress in November 1984 and set the guidelines and policies for the next five-year plan (1991-1995), the long-term plan, and future domestic and foreign work. The meeting was held smoothly and the results were significant.

Emphasizing the superiority of the socialist system and the importance of the leadership of the Communist Party was a main theme throughout the congress. Over the past 45 years of liberation, the Romanian people have deeply felt that only by adhering to the principles of independence, self-reliance, and self-improvement under the leadership of the Communist Party can Romania shake off its backward and impoverished image and set its country on a path of prosperity.

As Ceausescu pointed out in his report to the 14th Congress of the Romanian Communist Party, "Over the past 45 years, Romania has overcome the backward state caused by centuries of foreign rule, transforming itself from a backward agricultural country into an industrial and agricultural country with modern industry and thriving agriculture." In 1945, Romania's industrial output was 11.7 billion lei, which increased to 141.16 billion lei in 1988. Agricultural output increased from 25.4 billion lei in 1945 to 245.6 billion lei in 1988. Comrade Ceausescu linked all these achievements to the socialist system, emphasizing, "No one can deny the achievements of socialist countries."

At this congress, relevant Romanian officials expressed that although Romania has achieved historic successes, the construction of socialism still requires a long journey filled with hardships. Therefore, the Romanian Communist Party is determined to learn from both positive and negative experiences to ensure the continuous improvement of Romania's socialist construction. Ceausescu also pointed out in his report, "When socialist countries discard bad things, they should not discard socialism. What should be discarded are those who harm socialism with their actions."

Before the 14th Congress, the head of the Romanian Party School, Cochuba, told our reporter, "We have long been aware that if we do not guard against it, bourgeois liberalization will infiltrate and undermine the foundations of socialism. Therefore, the Romanian Communist Party attaches great importance to and strengthens work in the ideological field."

As early as June 1982, the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party formulated the "Guidelines for Ideological Work." In recent years, the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party has held several meetings to discuss ideological and political work. The "Guidelines" for socialist construction policies adopted at this 14th Congress of the Romanian Communist Party clearly stipulates strengthening ideological, theoretical, and political education and cultivating new people as an important task in Romania's socialist and communist education. The reporter saw that here, Marxist theoretical learning is supervised, and ideological and political work is managed. The Romanian Communist Party attaches great importance to using various opportunities and occasions to conduct patriotic education and national spirit education for young people. The propaganda of socialist construction achievements has reached a deep and widespread level. The editor of Romania's "Historical Magazine," Propishtinu, told the reporter, "'Peaceful evolution' cannot stand in our country."

Comrade Ceausescu humorously said at the congress, "Socialism has become a strong and handsome man. He grows faster in a month than others do in a year, thus becoming a strong youth, a young man who will stand in the world, because only socialism is the future of mankind!" He also said, "We will do our utmost to make the beautiful and vigorous socialism, this pride of mankind, not only triumph in Romania but also in the whole world."

　　沿着社会主义道路前进
　　新华社记者　周荣子
    罗共总书记尼·齐奥塞斯库11月24日在罗共14大闭幕式上讲话时说：“这次大会显示了全党、全国人民坚不可摧的团结，他们决心在党的领导下沿着社会主义道路继续前进。”
    罗共14大是11月20日至24日在布加勒斯特举行的。出席会议的3000多名代表认真总结了1984年11月13大以来罗的各项工作并为下一个五年计划（1991—1995年）、长远规划以及今后的对内对外工作确定了方针政策。这次会议开得是顺利的，会议所取得的结果是显著的。
    强调社会主义制度的优越性，强调共产党领导的重要性，作为一条主线贯穿了大会的始终。解放45年来，罗马尼亚人民深深体会到，只有在共产党的领导下坚持独立自主、自力更生的方针才能使罗摆脱贫穷落后的面貌，使自己的国家走上欣欣向荣的坦途。
    正如齐奥塞斯库在罗共14大报告中指出，“45年来罗马尼亚克服了数百年外来统治所造成的落后状态，把自己由一个落后的农业国变成一个拥有现代化工业和欣欣向荣农业的工农业国家。”1945年罗工业产值为117亿列伊，1988年增加到14116亿列伊，农业总产值由1945年的254亿列伊增加到1988年的2456亿列伊。齐奥塞斯库同志把这一切同社会主义制度联系在一起，他强调说：“谁也不能否认社会主义国家所取得的成就。”
    在这次代表大会上，罗共有关人士表示，罗虽然取得历史性的成就，但建设社会主义还需要一段漫长的路程，一条充满了艰辛的路，所以罗共决心从正反经验得到一切必要的教训，保证罗社会主义建设活动的继续完善。齐奥塞斯库在报告中也指出：“社会主义国家在抛弃坏东西时，也不应把社会主义扔掉。应该抛弃的是以自己的所作所为危害社会主义的那些人。”
    14大召开前夕，罗高级党校负责人科丘巴对本社记者说，他们早就意识到，如不防范，资产阶级自由化思想会长驱直入，会瓦解社会主义的墙角。因此罗共十分重视和加强意识形态领域的工作。
    早在1982年6月，罗共中央就制定了《意识形态工作的纲要》。近几年来罗共中央多次开会讨论思想政治工作。这次罗共14大通过的关于社会主义建设政策的“纲要”中，明确把加强思想、理论和政治教育及培养造就新人作为罗进行社会主义和共产主义教育的一项重要工作来抓。记者看到，这里的马克思主义理论学习是有人过问的，思想政治工作是有人抓的。罗共十分重视利用各种机会与场合对青少年进行爱国主义教育、民族气节教育。社会主义建设成就的宣传工作作到深入人心、家喻户晓的程度。罗马尼亚《历史杂志》主编普洛皮什迪努对记者说：“‘和平演变’在我们这里是站不住脚的。”
    齐奥塞斯库同志在大会上颇有风趣地说：“社会主义已成为一个健壮的美男子”，“他在一个月里长得比别人一年还快，因而成了一个体魄强壮的小伙子，一个将立足于世界的青年，因为只有社会主义才是人类的未来！”他还说：“我们将竭尽全力使美好、茁壮的社会主义这个人类骄子不仅在罗马尼亚，而且在全世界取得胜利。”
