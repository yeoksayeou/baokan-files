A four-day strategic goals report meeting on automation technology concluded today in Shenyang. After hearing the opinions of experts, State Councilor and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian delivered an important speech.

Song Jian affirmed the work in the field of automation technology within the national high-tech research and development plan. He pointed out that the two themes selected in the automation technology field—Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems (CIMS) and intelligent robots—are expected to produce the first batch of results within two to three years.

Song Jian emphasized that high-tech research should strive to coordinate with the tasks on the current main battlefield. When necessary, strategic goals, phase goals, and work arrangements should be adjusted. He said that the three-year rectification and adjustment period has provided a good opportunity for the development of China's high and new technology industries. Among the seven fields in the high-tech research and development plan, the automation field is most closely related to national economic development and technological progress, occupying a special position. He summarized the opinions of some scientists and ministries, and put forward specific requirements for the high-tech research and development plan.

Song Jian said that the strategic goals of high-tech research should, on the one hand, be based on the current main battlefield; on the other hand, they should guide the direction of technological transformation of large and medium-sized enterprises, ensuring continuous improvement of the intelligence and automation of traditional production lines. Attention should be paid to digesting, absorbing, and developing the advanced systems that have been introduced, especially to digesting various types of software, fully mastering their structure, functions, and styles, so that our software development work can start from a higher level. Intermediate results of various research projects should be promptly transferred to industrial departments to replace imports and develop exports. Every penny should be used carefully to maximize investment returns.

    宋健在自动化技术领域战略目标汇报会上强调
    抓住良机发展高新技术产业
    本报沈阳11月19日电　记者段心强报道：历时4天的自动化技术领域战略目标汇报会今天在沈阳结束。国务委员、国家科委主任宋健在听取了专家意见后，作了重要讲话。
    宋健肯定了国家高技术研究发展计划中自动化技术领域的工作，指出，自动化技术领域选定的两个主题——计算机综合自动化制造系统（CLMS）和智能机器人，可望于两、三年内拿到第一批成果。
    宋健强调，高技术研究要力求与当前主战场上的任务相协调，必要时也应该对战略目标和阶段目标以及工作部署做些调整。他说，三年治理整顿给我国高、新技术产业的发展提供一个良好的机会。在高技术研究发展计划的7个领域中，自动化领域与国民经济发展及技术进步联系最密切，处于一种特殊地位。他归纳一些科学家和部委的意见，对高技术研究发展计划提出了具体要求。
    宋健说，高技术研究的战略目标一方面应该以现在的主战场为依托；另一方面要引导大中型企业的技术改造方向，保证能持续不断地提高传统生产线的智能自动化程度。要注意消化、吸收和发展已引进的先进系统，特别要注意消化各类软件，充分掌握其结构、功能及风格，使我们的软件开发工作有较高的起点。各项研究的中间成果要及时向工业部门转移，以取代进口，发展出口。要爱惜使用每一分钱，最大限度发挥投资效益。
