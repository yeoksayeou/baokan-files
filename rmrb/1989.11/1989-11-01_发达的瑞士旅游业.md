Swiss people often say that God has given them only the stones of the Alps and the water of the Aare River (Switzerland's internal river). Switzerland is poor in mineral resources, and raw materials and energy are almost entirely imported. However, the diverse and beautiful landscapes and natural scenery provide a unique advantage for the development of tourism, becoming an important source of wealth for Switzerland.

Switzerland's tourism industry began in the south. In 1825, the first foreign stagecoach crossed the St. Gotthard Pass, marking the earliest record of tourism here. In 1862, several cantons in southern Switzerland raised funds to provide free meals for 9,000 pedestrians. After the Franco-Prussian War, foreigners flocked to Switzerland's mountain areas in search of rest and recuperation.

Although Switzerland is a mountainous country, its roads and railways are extensive. The density of tunnels, bridges, and culverts, as well as the convenience of short-distance transportation to tourist spots, are rarely seen in the world.

In 1823, the first steamship for passengers, the "William Tell," appeared on Lake Geneva. Ten years later, all the major lakes in Switzerland had such ships. In 1871, the first rack railway in Europe was built here, and soon after, rack railways and cable cars were constructed on the main peaks of the Alps within the country. Of particular importance, the St. Gotthard Railway Tunnel opened in 1922, connecting the rail transport of Central and Southern Europe. The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel, connecting Northwestern Europe with Southeastern Europe, was completed in 1980, with a length of 17 kilometers, the longest in the world. Switzerland is not only the first country in the world to fully electrify its railways but also has high-speed roads connecting most major tourist spots. Currently, Switzerland has 94 kilometers of rack railways, more than 50 mountain railways, over 400 cable car lines, and more than 1,000 chairlift cables. On the Jungfraujoch, over 2 million people have taken the cable car to the top to enjoy the wonderful scenery. On the Jungfrau, nearly 70,000 people take the mountain railway up each year. Switzerland's tourism industry has flourished with the development of transportation.

Another important feature of Switzerland's tourism industry is the rapid development of the hotel industry. Currently, Switzerland has more than 7,000 hotels with 270,000 beds. During the peak tourist season, there are many "quasi-hotels" that can provide an additional 850,000 beds. Switzerland particularly values the training of hotel industry personnel and the improvement of service quality. There are well-equipped tourism schools here, training personnel from ordinary service staff to high-level hotel managers. Among them, the Lausanne Hotel School is renowned worldwide, and students from all over the world flock to study here. A representative of the Swiss Tourism Association said: Developing tourism means being a good "servant." We have only one master, and that is the customer. The customer is the "emperor." Upon arrival in Switzerland, tourists can purchase transportation tickets valid for varying periods at the border, allowing them to travel by train, ship, and public bus throughout the country.

In summary, Switzerland pays special attention to the coordinated development of scenic spots, transportation, hotels, and services, making it a well-deserved tourist country. These comfortable and convenient tourism conditions attract domestic and foreign tourists year-round, with the most visitors during the snowy winter. In the resort towns of Davos, the Jungfrau, and the enchanting Jungfraujoch, tens of thousands of skiing enthusiasts gather each winter. Many world-renowned figures and movie stars are regular visitors. The Swiss also have a tradition of loving tourism, with an average of 75% of people traveling at least four days a year, ranking first in the world. In 1987, the total number of overnight stays by domestic and foreign tourists was 75.7 million, including 34.82 million overnight stays by foreign tourists, with an average of six foreign tourists staying overnight per Swiss person. In 1988, tourism revenue was 16.94 billion Swiss francs, accounting for 6% of the national GDP. Of this, 6.6 billion came from domestic tourists and 10.34 billion from foreign tourists. After deducting the 8.76 billion Swiss francs spent by Swiss people abroad, the net income from abroad was 1.6 billion Swiss francs. Tourism revenue accounts for 10% of total export revenue, making it the third-largest source of foreign exchange income after mechanical and chemical exports. The tourism industry also provides jobs for approximately 260,000 people, and in nearly 3,000 towns and villages across the country, almost every town is connected to the tourism industry. Switzerland's tourism industry maintains its vitality through these high-quality services.

    发达的瑞士旅游业
    王熙敬
    瑞士人常说，上帝赐予他们的只有阿尔卑斯山的石头和阿尔河（瑞士内河）的水。瑞士矿藏资源贫乏，原料和能源几乎全靠进口。但多种多样的秀丽风光和自然美景却为发展旅游业提供了得天独厚的便利条件，成了瑞士致富的重要源泉。
    瑞士的旅游业始于南方。一八二五年第一辆外国驿车越过圣哥达山口，是这里最早的旅游记载。一八六二年，瑞士南部几州据此通过募捐为九千名徒步旅行者免费提供膳食。普法战争后，外国人纷至沓来，在瑞士山区寻觅休养之地。
    瑞士虽为山地之国，其公路、铁路却四通八达，隧道、桥梁和涵洞的密度以及旅游点的短途交通之便为世界所少见。
    一八二三年在日内瓦湖出现了第一艘为旅客服务的蒸汽机船《威廉退尔》号，十年后，瑞士所有大湖都有了这种游船。一八七一年欧洲第一条齿轮式爬山铁路在此问世，之后在其境内的阿尔卑斯山的主要山峰很快都修建了齿轮火车轨道和电缆车线。特别重要的是，一九二二年圣哥达铁路隧道通车，从而沟通了中南欧的铁路运输；连接西北欧与东南欧的圣哥达公路隧道也于一九八○年建成，其长度十七公里，居世界第一。瑞士不仅是世界上第一个火车全部电气化的国家，而且主要旅游点多有高速公路连接。现瑞士拥有齿轮火车轨九十四公里，登山火车线五十多条，电缆吊车线四百多条，吊椅电缆一千余条。在天使山迄今共有二千余万人乘缆车登高，欣赏这里的奇妙美景。在游人向往的少女峰，每年有近七十万人乘爬山火车上山。瑞士旅游业正是随着交通的发展而兴旺起来的。
    瑞士旅游业的又一重要标志是旅馆业的迅猛发展。目前瑞士拥有旅馆七千多家，床位二十七万张。在旅游旺季，还有许多“准旅馆”，可提供床位八十五万张。瑞士尤其重视培养和训练旅馆行业人员，提高服务质量。这里有设备齐全的旅游学校，培养从普通服务员到高级饭店经理各类人员，其中以洛桑旅馆学校闻名遐迩，世界各地的学生争先恐后到此就读。瑞士旅游协会负责人说：发展旅游就要甘当“仆人”，我们只有一个主人，这就是客人，客人就是“皇上”。游人一到瑞士，在入境口岸可购买有效期长短不等的交通联票，凭此可在全国乘坐火车、轮船和公共汽车。
    总之，瑞士特别注意风景点、交通、旅馆和服务配套发展，从而使该国成为当之无愧的旅游之国。这种舒适而方便的旅游条件使国内外游客一年四季络绎不绝，而在大雪纷纷的冬天，游人最多。在疗养胜地达沃斯雪山、象征“纯结”的少女峰和令人迷恋的天使山，每年冬天都云集着成千上万的滑雪爱好者。一些世界名流、影剧明星都是这里的常客。瑞士人也有喜爱旅游的传统，平均百分之七十五的人每年至少旅游四天，居世界首位。一九八七年，国内外游客过夜者共七千五百七十万人次，其中外国旅游者过夜人次三千四百八十二万，平均每个瑞士人接待六个外国人过夜。一九八八年，旅游收入为一百六十九点四亿瑞郎，占国民生产总值百分之六，其中六十六亿来源于本国旅游者，一百零三点四亿来源于外国旅游者，除去瑞士人国外花费的八十七点六亿，国外净收入为十六亿瑞郎。瑞士旅游收入占出口总收入的百分之十，是继机械和化工出口之后，外汇收入最多的行业。旅游业还为大约二十六万人提供了工作岗位，在全国三千多个乡（镇）中，几乎乡乡都与旅游业有联系。瑞士旅游业正是以上述优质服务始终保持着旺盛的活力。
