The Bomê Highway, after nearly 15 years of arduous struggle, has finally crossed its most treacherous section—the 4,000-meter-high snow-capped mountains of Garlung La and Sala, and is now steadily advancing towards the only county in China without a highway, the Tibetan county of Mêdog.

The Bomê Highway stretches from the city of Bomê to the city of Mêdog, with the entire route winding through towering mountains and deep valleys. The terrain is extremely treacherous, and during the rainy season, floods, landslides, mudslides, and rockfalls wreak havoc. Although the entire highway is only 141 kilometers long, the average elevation is nearly 3,000 meters, making it feel like working and living in the sky compared to the inland regions. The construction and living conditions are exceptionally harsh.

　　波墨公路跨险关
    据新华社拉萨11月26日电　（记者王岳龙、程红根）艰苦奋战已近15年的波墨公路日前终于跨过了途中最大的天险——海拔4000多米的大雪山嘎隆拉山和萨拉山，正顽强地向我国唯一未通公路的县——西藏墨脱延伸。
    波墨公路是由波密县城到墨脱县城，整个路段都在崇山峻岭之中，地势十分险恶不说，每到雨季山洪暴发，塌方、滑坡、泥石流肆虐为害。公路全线虽只有141公里，但平均海拔高度近3000米，与内地相比等于身在半空，施工、生活条件异常艰苦。
