Cao Cao, in the gallery of characters in Chinese classical opera, is a figure with a unique charm. These portrayals are either exaggerated based on the novel "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" or align with some historians' historical evaluations of Cao Cao. However, in terms of artistic imagery, both are one-sided in character and have not reached a deeper level of multi-faceted character development in aesthetics.

Shang Changrong's portrayal of Cao Cao in "Cao Cao and Yang Xu" is different. He is a man who cares for the country and its people, eagerly seeks talented individuals, and has the grand ideal of unifying China. Within his robust and stern demeanor, he also possesses elegance and human warmth. At the same time, he favors flatterers, is cunning and suspicious, arrogant, jealous of talent, and cruel. He is a typical politician of the feudal era, yet also a flesh-and-blood human being. In short, he is a combination of greatness and meanness. Shang Changrong presents to us on stage a unique "living Cao Cao."

Such a unique "Cao Cao opera" obviously requires more than the traditional means of expression. Shang Changrong's reform experiment begins with makeup. He changes the base color of Cao Cao's facial makeup from cold white to warm white, giving it a human touch. He changes the triangular eyes to thick eyebrows and large eyes, making them more open. He moves the "matchmaker mole" between the nose and lips to the forehead, turning it into a healthy "vermilion mole," and adds a "hard chest red" in the center of the forehead, increasing the character's heroism.

Shang Changrong's most significant experiment is to combine the two major branches of the "Jing" (painted face) role—"Jiazi" and "Tongchui"—to create the image of Cao Cao. Throughout the entire play, we see the shadows of the Jing masters Jin, Hao, Hou, and Qiu in Shang Changrong's performance, but it is difficult to pinpoint which part of the play is completely imitated from any one school. In the fifth scene, where Cao Cao helps Yang Xu with the horse and gets his foot caught in the stirrup, and the horse is startled by the snow, it is somewhat like the famous play "Horse Tramples the Green Sprouts." The two large circles and the staggering steps are indeed borrowed from the Hou school's techniques, creating the atmosphere this scene should have. At the same time, Shang Changrong also borrows more from the Hao school in terms of posture, shape, and dialogue, making the "Snow Treading" scene's Cao Cao, though in a predicament, not lose the dignity of a great politician.

In terms of singing, Shang Changrong avoids the "Jiazi" style and adheres to the "Tongchui" style, striving for emotional expression. His voice is powerful, reminiscent of the Jin school, but his singing style often follows the Qiu school's path.

Shang Changrong's creative method is to use the character's personality as the warp and the techniques of the "Tongchui" and "Jiazi" schools as the weft, weaving together a "living Cao Cao" and constructing his own artistic palace. Looking through the history of Peking Opera, we know that the earliest Jing masters were all proficient in both singing and acting. Later, the "Tongchui" and "Jiazi" schools emerged, and Jing artists focused on either singing or acting. As the heir of Shang Xiaoyun, growing up in the artistic atmosphere of the Shang school, which is known for its excellence in both singing and acting, Shang Changrong has long had the ideal of "Jiazi acting and Tongchui singing," and he has the natural advantage of a superior voice. Through his previous works, such as "Shooting the Tiger's Mouth," "Zhang Fei Pays Respect to the Wise," "Niu Gao Pulls the Edict," and "Li Kui Visits His Mother," we can see that his above-mentioned ideal has been put into practice. Now, through "Cao Cao and Yang Xu," we can see that his artistic style has become more clear and systematic.

However, relying solely on the Jing role is not enough to fully express the character of "this" Cao Cao. Shang Changrong's creative thinking still has room for further exploration. He directly learns from the Sheng (male) role's Qi school, breaking free from the shackles of conventions more than other Jing actors, making Cao Cao's performance more realistic and with a stronger stage rhythm. In his dialogue, he incorporates some Kunqu and ancient pronunciations, such as the "wu" in "thousand miles without the crowing of a rooster" and the "zhan" in "military supplies and warhorses," to showcase Cao Cao's literary talent and elegance. He uses the rapid shaking sound of the helmet beads to depict Cao Cao's tense and remorseful psychological state after mistakenly killing Kong Wende. He uses the sound of slapping his thigh like a judge's gavel to portray Cao Cao's intense inner turmoil between his authoritative personality and human nature before killing Yang Xu.

Shang Changrong's "this" Cao Cao has another distinctive feature: sincerity. Even Cao Cao's lie about having "a chronic dream illness" is told as if it were true, bringing the audience into the reality of life, with no sense of "acting." This style of performance is quite different from Yuan Shihai's. Mr. Yuan likes to exaggerate Cao Cao's ugly and pathetic appearance, such as in "The Road to Huaxiang," where he pounds his chest and kicks his feet, and wears his hat askew. This, of course, is not without a kind of cartoonish formal beauty. But Shang Changrong considers more from the content, precisely because Cao Cao's seeking of talent is sincere and genuine, with not a hint of falsehood. Therefore, when he finally painfully tells Yang Xu, "I really didn't want to kill you, but I really had to!" These few lines of dialogue have more tragic power, elevating the play's anti-feudal ideological content.

In the 1980s, the Peking Opera world first had Fang Rongzhang famous nationwide. His artistic value lies in the inheritance of the Qiu school's vocal style. However, at the height of his fame, someone sighed: if this "nine out of ten Jing actors are from the Qiu school" continues, can the Jing art still develop? Now, Shang Changrong is emerging, and his artistic value lies in the integration and enrichment of the Jing art. He brings a fresh breeze to the stage, easing the "imbalanced" situation of "nine out of ten Jing actors are from the Qiu school" and broadening the expressive power of the Jing art.

    别开生面的“活曹操”
    ——评尚长荣在《曹操与杨修》中的表演
     翁思再
    曹操，在中国古典戏曲的人物画廊里，是一个具有独特光彩的形象。它们或是在小说《三国演义》基础上的再夸张，或符合一些史学家对曹操的历史评判。然而就艺术形象而论，二者的性格都是单侧面的，在审美上未能进入一个多侧面性格的更深层次。
    尚长荣在《曹操与杨修》中塑造的曹操则不然，他忧国忧民，求贤若渴，有统一中华的宏伟理想，于雄健威严之中，兼备儒雅和人情味；同时，他又宠信小人，奸诈多疑，唯我独尊，忌贤妒能，凶暴残忍……他是封建时代的典型政治家，又是一个有血有肉的人，质言之，他是伟大和卑微的性格组合体，尚长荣在舞台上向我们呈现的，是别开生面的“活曹操”。
    如此别开生面的“曹操戏”，显然前人积累的表现手段是不够用了。尚长荣的改革实验是从化妆开始的。他把曹操脸谱的底色，由阴白改为暖白，赋之以“人”气；把三角眼改成浓眉大眼，变得疏朗些；把鼻唇之间“彩旦”般的“媒婆痣”移到额头，成为健美的“朱砂痣”；并在前额中央加画一条“硬膛红”，增加了人物的英气。
    尚长荣最重大的一项实验，是把花脸行当中的两大支派——“架子”和“铜锤”归并塑造曹操形象。纵观全剧，我们从尚长荣的表演中看到了金、郝、侯、裘诸位净行先辈的影子，但又很难指明哪一段戏是完全模仿某派的。第五场中，曹操为杨修牵马坠蹬、踏雪惊马的场面，有点像名剧
  《马踏青苗》，那两个大圆场和踉跄步履等，确是借鉴了侯派的技法，营造了这场戏应有的气氛。与此同时，尚长荣又在工架、造型、念白等方面较多借鉴郝派，更富雄浑壮阔的气势，使“踏雪”一场里的曹操，虽有狼狈之处，却不失大政治家的气度。
    尚长荣在演唱方面，则力避“架子”，皈依“铜锤”，务使抒情到家。其音色之刚劲，颇有金派的意味，然其运腔，则常见裘派的轨迹。
    尚长荣的创作方法，是以角色的性格为经，以“铜锤”
  “架子”的各派技法为纬，编织出一个“活曹操”，构架起自己的艺术殿堂。翻开一部京剧史，可知最早的净行大师都是集唱、表于一身的，后来出现了“铜锤”和“架子”的分野，净行艺术家分别在唱或做的园地里精耕细作。作为尚小云的哲嗣，在文武兼备的旦行尚派艺术的氛围中成长，尚长荣早有“架子表演铜锤唱”的理想，而且有天赋优越的嗓音条件。我们通过他以前的作品，如《射虎口》《张飞敬贤》《牛皋扯旨》《李逵探母》等戏中，可见其上述理想已经付诸实践，如今，通过《曹操与杨修》，可知他的艺术风格更为明晰化、系统化了。
    然而，仅靠花脸行当还不足以涵盖和表现“这一个”曹操的全部性格，尚长荣的创作思路还有进一步的开拓之处。他直接向生行的麒派取法，比别的净行演员更多地挣脱程式的羁绊，使曹操的表演更具现实主义的感染力和更强烈的舞台节奏。他在念白中掺用一些南昆字音或古音，如“千里无鸡鸣”的“无”字，“军粮战马”的“战”字等，以表现曹操的文采风流。他用盔珠的急剧抖动声，描绘曹操得知错杀孔文岱后，紧张、痛悔的心理状态。他用掌击大腿有如惊堂木般的“啪啪”之声，刻画曹操在诛杀杨修之前，其内心在权势人格和人性的矛盾冲突中产生的剧烈震撼。
    尚长荣的“这一个”曹操还有一个显著特点，在于“真诚”二字。连曹操“夙有夜梦之疾”的谎言，也说得像真的一样，把观众带到生活真实之中，决不给人以“做戏”之感。这种演法同袁世海大异其趣。袁先生喜欢夸张曹操的丑态和狼狈相，如《华容道》中的捶胸蹬足、歪带帽子之类，这当然也不失一种漫画式的形式美。但尚长荣更多从内容考虑，唯其曹操的求贤是真心诚意的，没有半点虚假，那么他最后痛苦地对杨修说：“我实实地不想杀你，可又实实地不得不杀！”
    这几句台词才更具有悲剧的力量，使全剧反封建的思想内涵得到升华。
    80年代的京剧界，先有方荣翔驰誉全国，他的艺术价值，在于对裘派声腔的继承。然而就在他独领风骚之时，曾有人喟叹：如此“十净九裘”下去，花脸艺术还能不能发展？如今，又有尚长荣头角峥嵘，他的艺术价值，在于对净行艺术的综合和丰富、充实。他为剧坛吹来一股清新的风，使“十净九裘”的
  “失衡”局面得以缓和，拓宽了花脸艺术的表现力。
