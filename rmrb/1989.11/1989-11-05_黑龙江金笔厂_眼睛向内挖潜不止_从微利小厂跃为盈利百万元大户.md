The Black Dragon River Gold Pen Factory has been relentlessly tapping into its potential and achieving increased production and savings. Each round of potential tapping brings in profits. Over the past three years, by implementing more than 20 potential-tapping measures, this factory with fewer than 500 employees has transformed from a small, marginally profitable unit into a highly profitable enterprise earning over a million yuan.

For over 30 years, the factory has relied on workers' naked-eye experience to heat pen tips, resulting in high loss rates. For instance, in 1987, 70,000 pen tips were wasted due to overheating. In 1988, they introduced a constant temperature control method for heating pen tips, saving over 4,000 yuan that year. Previously, pen tips were made using 601 iridium gold granules. Last year, they improved the technology and switched to using 188 iridium gold granules, reducing the cost per granule from 8.3 fen to 2.8 fen. This single change saved 140,000 yuan annually. How much potential does an enterprise have? Factory Director Deng Zao Lan said: The wealth of an enterprise lies in its potential. Increased production and savings mean continuously tapping into potential, turning each potential into wealth. In a sense, increased production, savings, and potential tapping are endless. In 1985, the factory's profit was only 60,000 yuan, but by last year, it had reached over a million yuan, with taxes and profits increasing from 510,000 yuan to 2.4 million yuan.

The potential for increased production and savings is hidden in every corner of the enterprise, mainly in the management domain. Over the years, this factory has been meticulous in other areas but generous in training cadres and employees. They spend money sending people to various industry training classes and frequently organize professional staff to learn from other factories. Each time these individuals gain new insights, they return with one or two new cost-saving methods. After learning from Shanghai's management experience, this factory strengthened and improved planning, processes, and labor management, implementing a strict responsibility system for each position, significantly enhancing labor productivity.

### 黑龙江金笔厂  眼睛向内挖潜不止  从微利小厂跃为盈利百万元大户

    黑龙江金笔厂  眼睛向内挖潜不止
    从微利小厂跃为盈利百万元大户
    本报讯　黑龙江金笔厂挖潜不止，增产节约。每挖一次都有“进账”。近3年，由于实行挖潜措施20多项，这个不足500人的微利小厂成了盈利百万的“富翁”。
    30多年来，该厂一直凭工人肉眼经验烫笔舌，损失率很高，如1987年，仅烫弯的笔舌就有7万多个。1988年，他们引入恒温控制烘笔法，当年节约4000多元。笔尖头过去用的是601铱金粒，去年改进技术，采用188铱金粒，每粒单价由8.3分降到2.8分。仅此一项，全年节约14万元。在一个企业，这样的潜力知多少？厂长邓兆兰说：企业的财富蕴藏在潜力中。增产节约就是要不断挖潜，把一个个潜力变成一笔笔财富。从一定意义上看，增产节约、挖潜，都是没有止境的。1985年，该厂只盈利6万，到去年盈利就达上百万，利税由51万提高到240万元。
    增产节约的潜力藏在企业各个角落，主要在管理领域。这个厂这些年在其它方面精打细算，培训干部职工却很大方。他们花钱送人参加各种行业学习班，不断组织专业人员到外厂取经。这些人每长一次见识，回来就提出一两个节约新法。学习了上海有关管理经验后，这个厂加强和改善计划、工艺、劳动等方面的管理，实行严格的岗位责任制，劳动生产率明显提高。　　　　（张彦超）
