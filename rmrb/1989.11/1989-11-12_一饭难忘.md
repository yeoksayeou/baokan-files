	An Unforgettable Meal

	The editorial board of the "Group Speech" magazine sent me a letter requesting an article. It was to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, inviting intellectuals to share one unforgettable event from their 40 years of experience.

	In 1951, we returned to our beloved motherland after much hardship. Reflecting on these 40 years, it has been a tumultuous journey. Like all intellectuals in the country, we have weathered the storms and our memories have become blurred. However, there is one small but deeply etched event that remains as vivid as if it happened yesterday. This is the cherished memory of having dinner with our beloved Premier Zhou.

	It was a summer morning in 1952. The Premier's office called to say he wanted to see us that evening.

	We were so excited. It felt like the day would never end, and the scorching sun seemed reluctant to set! Finally, after dinner, around 7 PM, a car arrived with a young man named Luo Qingchang, who took us into the picturesque night scene of Zhongnanhai to the Premier's office.

	Premier Zhou greeted us with a warm smile, shaking our hands firmly and saying, "You're back! How are you?" He then kindly asked us to sit on either side of him and inquired in detail about our work and life in Japan, as well as our journey back. We answered him one by one. During this time, staff members frequently came in with documents or whispered something in the Premier's ear. By then, it was almost midnight. We thought the Premier was extremely busy and should not waste his precious time, so we stood up to leave. However, the Premier insisted, "Why don't you stay and have dinner with me? We can continue our conversation while eating."

	I don't remember if there were other people at the table, but I do recall that there were four dishes and one soup, with the only meat dish being a plate of fried eggs. This surprised and delighted us! We were amazed that the Premier of the People's Republic of China had such simple meals, and we were touched that our beloved Premier did not treat us as "guests."

	After dinner, we knew the Premier was very busy and it was already so late, so we thanked him and said our goodbyes. The Premier even walked us to the car. Looking up at the starry sky, he sighed, "Time flies. From the May Fourth Movement to now, it has been over thirty years!"

	To be honest, I have been a guest countless times in my life and have tasted countless delicacies; both domestically and abroad, I have tried snails, lungfish, snake meat, horse meat... But I have forgotten the names of the hosts and the dining locations almost entirely. Only the simple dinner that Premier Zhou invited me to has forever stayed in the depths of my heart!

     一饭难忘
    《群言》杂志社给我来了一封征稿信，是纪念中华人民共和国成立40周年纪念日，约请知识界人士讲自己40年中一件难忘的往事。
    1951年，我们艰辛辗转地回到了热爱的祖国，从头回忆这40年的岁月，真是风风雨雨。我们也和全国知识界人士一样，从风风雨雨中走过来了，回忆的神经也都麻木模糊了。只有一件极小而值得铭心刻骨的事，就像昨天发生的事一样，永远清楚活跃地展现在我的眼前，这便是敬爱的周总理和我们共进的一次晚餐。
    那是1952年夏天的一个早晨，总理办公厅来了一个电话说总理在这天晚上约见我们。
    我们是多么兴奋呵，只觉得这一天的光阴是特别地长，炎热的太阳总是迟迟地不肯落下去！好容易在我们吃过晚饭后，大约是傍晚7时光景，来了一辆小轿车和那时还是个小伙子的罗青长同志，把我们接进夜景如画的中南海，到了总理的办公室。
    周总理笑容满面地从门内迎了出来，紧紧地握住我们的手说：“你们回来了，你们好呵？”又亲切地让我们在他两旁坐下，极其详尽地问到我们在日本工作生活的情况，以及辗转回来的经历。我们也一一作了回答。这其中不时都有工作人员来送文件或在总理身边低声报告些什么。这时已近午夜，我们想总理日理万机，不应该多浪费他的宝贵时间，起身要走，总理却挽留我们说：
  “你们在这里和我共进晚餐吧，我们一边吃，一边还可以谈谈。”
    我也忘了桌上还有其他的人没有，只记得饭桌上是四菜一汤，唯一的荤菜竟只是一盘炒鸡蛋。这使我们感到惊奇而又高兴！惊奇的是一位堂堂中华人民共和国的总理，膳食竟是这样地简单，高兴的是我们热爱的总理并没有把我们当做“客人”。
    饭后，我们知道总理很忙，时间又那么晚了，即便道谢告辞了出来，总理还热情地送到车边。他仰望着满天的星斗，慨叹地说：“时光过得真快，从‘五四’到现在，已经三十多年了！”
    说来惭愧，我这一辈子做过无数次的客，吃过多少山珍海味；在国内、在海外，什么蜗牛、肺鱼、蛇肉、马肉……我都尝过，但是主人的姓名和进餐的地点，我几乎忘得一干二净，只有周总理约我的那一顿朴素的晚餐，却永远遗留在我内心的深处！
