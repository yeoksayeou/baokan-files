Kailuan Railway Bureau, located in the rugged mountains of southern Yunnan, is the only narrow-gauge railway bureau in the country. Despite facing extremely unfavorable transportation and operational conditions, the bureau has consistently completed its transportation production tasks year after year. Notably, by September 26 of this year, the bureau had completed all its contracted tasks while achieving 2,000 consecutive days of safe operation without any major or serious accidents. This record has been maintained to this day. The total accident rate per million kilometers of locomotive operation is 1.6 incidents, which is the lowest in the country.
