It is reported that a ceramic factory in Handan, Hebei Province, has been famous for producing blue-and-white porcelain since the Northern Song Dynasty. A few years ago, taking advantage of the trend of gift-giving, they produced sets of tableware, teaware, and drinkware, which were popular in more than 20 provinces and cities. Later, with the trend of "separate dining," they followed the trend and produced seven-inch and eight-inch plates, small bowls, which were also popular for a while. Since July this year, the factory sent people to various hotels and reception halls to gather information and found that sets of tableware were stagnant, while large soup bowls and extra-large dinner plates were in high demand. The factory then decided to discard over 1,000 old molds and set up a new production line, with two workshops producing 10-inch and 12-inch extra-large dinner plates. Since August, they have been producing 40,000 pieces per month, but the demand still exceeds supply, with monthly orders reaching 70,000 pieces. One hotel ordered 10,000 pieces of 12-inch extra-large dinner plates in one go (see October 28th Science and Technology Daily).

Undoubtedly, the information awareness, market concept, and leadership level of the factory's leaders are all top-notch. However, the "information" they gathered is bitter to swallow for those who are committed to building a clean government.

Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the central authorities have strongly advocated for hard work, thrift, and cracking down on extravagant banquets funded by public money. Central leaders have led by example, and various regions have responded enthusiastically, achieving significant results. However, the "ghost" of public dining has not completely disappeared in some places. Like the White Bone Demon in the "Journey to the West," it changes its form and appears in another guise. Isn't it advocating for "four dishes and one soup"? After all, it hasn't specified whether it's "scrambled eggs" or "fried squid rolls," "tomato soup" or "bird's nest soup," nor has it limited the amount of each dish. Therefore, some people have been focusing on the plates and bowls, combining several dishes into one large plate, and the seafood in a single soup is measured in pounds. Recently, there have been many articles in newspapers praising the achievements of curbing the banquet culture, which is undoubtedly true. However, we should also see that those who are addicted to public dining are still finding ways to circumvent the rules and exploit loopholes. If we are not vigilant against the latter group's tricks, the campaign to curb banquet culture may "blow over" in some places.

A hotel manager mentioned the use of "extra-large dinner plates" and revealed a bit of his difficulties, saying: "Now when officials come from higher levels, we who do the reception work can neither violate the policy nor satisfy them. Hotels and factories have no choice but to focus on 'less, bigger, and better.'" According to this manager's words, the key to curbing the banquet culture is still for leaders to set an example. "Officials from higher levels" must pay attention to their behavior. Now the central leaders have set a good example, and if all levels of leaders follow, the trend of extravagant banquets will not be difficult to curb. We must not misinterpret the "spirit" anymore.

The article can stop here. However, I suddenly thought of that ceramic factory. Their "extra-large dinner plates" will probably not be in demand for long, right?

    不要再把“经”念歪
    刘绍楹
    报载，河北省邯郸市某陶瓷厂从北宋就以生产青花瓷驰名全国，前几年利用社会上送礼成风的“信息”，生产成套餐具、茶具、酒具，畅销20多个省市。后来时尚“分餐制”，他们“紧跟形势”，生产七寸、八寸盘，小碗，又畅销好一阵子。今年7月以来，厂里派人到各地宾馆、招待所摸行情，得知套具已滞销，而大汤盆、特大号餐盘成了热门货。于是厂方毅然改掉1000多个旧模具，上了一条新流水线，由两个车间生产10寸、12寸特大号餐盘。8月份以来月产4万件，还供不应求，月订量达7万件。有一家宾馆一次订货就要12寸特大餐盘1万件（见10月28日科技日报）。
    毫无疑问，这个厂领导人的信息意识、市场观念和领导水平，都堪称是一流的。但是，他们摸到的“信息”，对于有志于廉政建设的人说，则有一股难以下咽的苦涩味儿。
    党的十三届四中全会以来，中央大力提倡艰苦奋斗、厉行节约，狠刹公款吃喝歪风，中央领导从自身做起，各地纷纷响应，取得了很大成绩。但是，“公吃”这个幽灵在有些地方仍不退出历史舞台。就像被孙悟空打了一棒的白骨精，变了个身影又以另一种面目出现了。不是提倡“四菜一汤”吗？反正也没具体规定是“炒鸡蛋”还是“炒鱿鱼卷”，是“西红柿汤”还是“燕窝汤”，也没限定每盘菜的量。于是有些人就在盘儿碗儿上动脑筋，把若干种菜拼入一个大盘里，一个汤里的山珍海味多以斤计。最近一段时间，报章上常有文章赞扬刹吃喝风取得的成绩，这当然是无可质疑的。但也应当看到那些“公吃”成瘾的人仍在变换花样搞对策，钻空子。不警惕后一种人做手脚，说不定这次刹吃喝风在一些地方还会“风过树抬头”。
    有一家宾馆经理谈起使用“特大餐盘”露了一点难言之隐，他说：“现在上边来人，我们这些做接待工作的既不能违背政策，又要让人家满意。宾馆、厂家是不得已而为之，逼得在‘少大精’上做文章。”按照这位经理的说法，刹吃喝风的关键仍是领导带头。“上边来人”一定要注意自己的行为。现在中央领导已经带了好头，各级领导干部都跟上，吃喝之风就不难刹住。再不能把“经”念歪了。
    作文至此，可以打住了。可是，我忽然想到了那个陶瓷厂。他们的“特大餐盘”的滞销大概为期不会很远了吧？
