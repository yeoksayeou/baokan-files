In 1988, Czechoslovakia's total grain production reached 11.822 million tons, with per capita grain availability of approximately 800 kilograms, placing it among the world's leading nations. Just 15 years earlier, Czechoslovakia had to import nearly 2 million tons of grain annually.

Czechoslovakia's ability to revitalize its agriculture in such a short period is due to a series of effective policies and measures, one of the most important being the establishment of a new seed management system and a comprehensive system for seed breeding, reproduction, processing, storage, transportation, sales, and promotion.

Firstly, a strict seed inspection system was established. Developing a superior variety typically requires seven to eight years of dedicated work by breeders. To ensure that the developed varieties do not become mixed or degenerate during reproduction, a strict seed inspection system must be in place. Czechoslovakia established specialized seed inspection and identification research institutes in both republics, each responsible for seed inspection and identification in their respective republics, and jointly formulated unified seed quality standards. From trial fields and demonstration areas to large-scale reproduction, all must be inspected and approved by experts from the seed inspection and identification research institutes. After threshing, drying, cleaning, medicating, and coating, the finished seeds undergo a germination test. Only those that meet quality standards are issued sales and promotion permits. Due to the establishment of a comprehensive quality control and inspection system during seed breeding and processing, the quality and purity of the seeds are guaranteed, preventing seed degeneration due to poor management.

Secondly, the country implemented a system of specialized seed management and unified administration. According to the federal government's regulations, seeds are managed and operated by the "Agroseva" and "Slovak Agroseva" seed companies, which are subordinate to the agricultural and food departments of the Czech and Slovak republics, respectively. These companies implement "three standardizations" and "five unifications." The "three standardizations" are: standardization of seed work, commercialization, and integration. The "five unifications" are: unified quality standards, unified seed production, unified identification, unified sales, and unified promotion.

These two seed companies are autonomous economic entities that operate independently, manage their own finances, and are responsible for their own profits and losses. They are also integrated entities that combine research, production, storage, supply, and sales.

    从缺粮到余粮
    ——捷建立种子经营管理新秩序
    1988年捷克斯洛伐克粮食总产量达到1182.2万吨，人均占有粮食约800公斤，跨入世界前列。而15年前，捷克斯洛伐克每年却要进口粮食近200万吨。
    捷能在不长时间内振兴农业是由于采取了一系列行之有效的政策措施，其中重要的一着是建立种子经营管理新秩序和种子选育、繁殖、加工、储运、销售、推广一条龙新体制。
    首先，建立严格的种子检验制度。培育一个优良品种，一般要由育种专家付出七八年的辛勤劳动，要使育成的良种能保证在繁殖过程中不致混杂和退化，必须建立严格的种子检验制度。捷在两个共和国建立了专门的种子检验鉴定研究所，分别负责两个共和国的种子检验与鉴定工作，并联合制定统一的种子质量标准。从种子试验田、示范区开始到大规模繁殖，都必须经种子检验鉴定研究所专家到田间检验认可。脱粒、干燥、清选、拌药、包衣后的成品种子，最后还要作发芽试验，质量合格的才发给销售、推广许可证。由于在种子繁育和加工过程中建立了一整套严格的质量把关秩序和检验制度，保证了种子的质量和纯度，避免了种子因经营不善而混杂退化。
    其次，全国实行了种子专营和统一管理。根据联邦政府的规定，种子由捷克和斯洛伐克两个共和国农业食品部分属的“奥塞瓦”和“斯洛伐塞瓦”两家种子公司专营、统一管理，实行“三化”、“五统一”。“三化”是：种子工作规范化、商品化、一体化。“五统一”是：统一质量标准、统一制种、统一鉴定、统一销售、统一推广。
    这两个种子公司是自主经营、独立核算、自负盈亏、自成体系的生产经济实体，也是融科研、生产、贮运、供给、销售于一体的联合体。
