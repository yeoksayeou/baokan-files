Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 22nd.

The leader of the Chinese delegation to the International Discussion on Women's Political Participation, Lin Liyun, pointed out on the 22nd that women actively participating in the political life of the country not only helps in politically advocating for and guaranteeing equal rights for men and women but also contributes to promoting social development.

The five-day international discussion began on the 20th of this month. The conference is chaired by the Inter-Parliamentary Union, with representatives from 66 countries and 14 international organizations in attendance.

Lin Liyun stated in her speech at the conference that the Chinese government has always believed that participating in the political life of the country is a right of every citizen. Without the participation of women, who make up half of the population, China's democratic politics cannot be considered complete.

Lin Liyun introduced the situation of women's political participation in China. She said that the rights and status of Chinese women are guaranteed by the Constitution and relevant laws. Chinese women participate in the management and supervision of state and social affairs through various channels and forms, and women's political participation has become an important part of China's political life.

She said that the Chinese government, as well as the All-China Women's Federation and other social organizations, are continuing to work to create a better social environment for the broad masses of women to participate in politics.
