The Debate on "Asset Concern"

"People care more about their own things than public property, which tends to deteriorate faster." Some people seem to believe this "private logic" is ironclad.

"After all, the factory isn't mine; if it goes bankrupt, the state will arrange another job for me." This is one of the points made in that "private ownership manifesto."

But does no one care about public property at Shougang?

After investigating Shougang, a central leader said, "Here, everyone is like a minister of finance."

Shougang bought second-hand equipment from Belgium to build its second steel plant, completing the project from start to steel production in just 22 months. The project manager, Man Kaihe, worked continuously for 8 months without returning home. Of course, he wasn't the only one.

"Early to bed, late to rise, weekends don't count," or "Early to bed, late to rise, weekends are just extra," was the daily routine for many Shougang employees. One factory director informed his family of the rules: "Don't wait for me to eat, don't worry if I come home or not." There were even two workshop directors whose wives came to the factory to find their husbands who didn't return home on weekends. When they saw their husbands in work clothes, covered in sweat, they immediately understood and burst into tears. During the Spring Festival at Shougang, the company would visit the families of employees, and people would say, borrowing a line from a song, "Shougang's achievements, half are mine, half are yours."

Some workers would carry iron boxes on their bicycles, picking up scraps along the way to work and handing them over to the factory.

Office envelopes were generally used four times, and some were found to have been used six times. The paper for the *Shougang Daily* was made from large sample sheets with writing on one side. It's hard to imagine these details appearing in a large enterprise that contributes billions of yuan annually...

A theorist, addressing the shortcomings of the old system, once raised the issue of "asset concern." The vitality of an enterprise ultimately manifests in the appreciation of its assets, which largely depends on the workers' concern for these assets. To enhance asset concern, people have explored various theories and practices. The issue of property rights, the discussion of ownership reform, and the trial of shareholding systems are all to some extent derived from this.

After 10 years of reform, Shougang's net fixed assets increased from 10.7 billion yuan in 1978 to 24 billion yuan in 1988 through self-accumulation, a 1.5-fold increase (excluding newly merged enterprises). The facts here at least form a "personal opinion": It is not necessary to change the ownership system, let alone privatize, to enhance people's asset concern. Under the public ownership system, this problem can be solved, and the key is reform.

"Only when an enterprise is privately owned will people care for it," is the reality and mindset of individual small-scale production. The appreciation of capitalist enterprises does not rely on this logic; it relies on exploitation. "This is my enterprise." Apart from the capitalist, which worker can say this? In recent years, their stock dispersion, enterprise welfare, and other measures aim precisely to conceal this substantive statement.

If socialist public ownership can find a good system, people will feel that the enterprise, this "big family," and their "small family" are integrated, and the enterprise, this family, is a more reliable guarantee of their fate, the main source of satisfying their material and spiritual needs. Their concern for the "big family" even surpasses their concern for the "small family," which is natural.

This is a historical transcendence of the two logics of "individual private ownership" and "capital private ownership"!

Contracting Opens Up New Paths

The large signboard in Shougang's factory area reads: "Contracting is the foundation."

The implementation of the contracting system at Shougang inevitably encountered storms and stresses, and there are still different levels of evaluations of the theories, mechanisms, and specific methods it provides. A comprehensive consideration of all this undoubtedly has important significance for improving the entire contracting system.

In fact, what is perhaps more meaningful is the path that the contracting system has opened up for China's overall reform. Here are just two or three innovative views proposed by Shougang workers.

The first view is that reform should pay attention to leveraging our unique advantages. The basic direction of economic reform is to transform a product economy into a socialist commodity economy. Therefore, introducing market mechanisms and enhancing market regulation is very necessary and important. This aspect must be continued. However, just as we should not have had too high expectations for the unified planning in the past, we should not overestimate the role of market mechanisms. Moreover, capitalism has already exploited the role of market mechanisms to the fullest. We, on the other hand, practice a combination of planning and market. Shougang's contracting mainly focuses on leveraging the two unique advantages of socialist public ownership enterprises: the interest mechanism of unified interests among three parties and the operating mechanism of the masses being masters of the enterprise, creating quite good economic efficiency and benefits even under not-so-good market conditions.

People still remember the article "How to Play Table Tennis" by Xu Yansheng in the 1960s, which discussed "leveraging strengths" and "overcoming weaknesses." The reform path of an enterprise is like this, and the overall reform path should be no different.

The second view is that the contracting system is beneficial for the compatibility of public ownership enterprises and commodity economy. In the primary stage of socialism, multiple economic components are allowed to coexist, but public ownership is the mainstay. The difficulty of reform lies in the incompatibility of the two. From the perspective of the enterprise, it lies in the fact that it cannot be self-sufficient. Everyone acknowledges that public ownership enterprises often bear profits but not losses, and it is even harder for them to go bankrupt. What can market competition do against them?

Is there a new concept of self-sufficiency? The document "Shougang's 10-Year Reform Summary" says there is. The specific explanation is: "After Shougang implemented the contracting system of increasing profit remittances, the enterprise must remit profits according to the contracting base and the increase rate. If it fails to complete the task, it must make up the shortfall with its own funds, and the development of the enterprise and the improvement of the workers' material and cultural life will be affected; if it exceeds the amount, the excess will be retained. The enterprise not only bears the responsibility for losses but also only obtains benefits when the profits exceed the annually increasing remittance amount... This is actually a higher-level self-sufficiency beyond the cost sense."

Their views are at least worth attention and discussion.

The essence of self-sufficiency is to establish a mechanism that combines incentives and constraints. A reasonable contracting system contains quite a few of these mechanisms. Shougang comrades say: "Some people say we are arrogant, but the increasing indicators press us so hard that we have no time to be arrogant!"

The third view is that reform and stability must be balanced, and the contracting system is beneficial for handling this relationship. The old system, if not reformed, is not conducive to stability. If the things that enterprises and workers need to do are solved through the methods of "waiting, relying, and asking," it is easy to develop into "complaining, laziness, and making trouble." The phenomenon of eating socialism and cursing socialism is a punishment from the old system. After contracting, the things one wants to obtain mainly rely on one's own labor and creation to obtain, complaining, laziness, and making trouble are useless and have a counterproductive effect, so there is no market for them. Some people asked a few Shougang workers why they didn't go to the protests a while ago? They said, "The things we want, we can't get them by going to the streets, but we can get them through contracting..."

There is a humorous saying that in large enterprises, Shougang is a "white crow" among many "black crows."

Is it saying that Shougang's conditions are special? The investigation found two points: some contracting enterprises are profit-sharing, while Shougang is full retention of excess profits; Shougang's self-sales rights for steel are 15%, higher than other similar enterprises. These two points have their historical causes. When Shougang started contracting, the steel market was sluggish, and the contracting base was much higher than the average of the previous three years. In any case, it still obtained some "preferential treatment." The current problem is, can it rely solely on drinking this "sweet water," rather than relying on the new internal mechanism, to make its feathers so beautiful?

What probably plays a key role is still those things that unify the two basic points with regularity, which is the essence of Shougang's experience.

Being in the environment of Shougang, one cannot help but feel the urge to shout for it, and it also arouses the desire for broader thinking.

It is undeniable that in recent years, some people seem to have increased their confusion and even pessimism about socialist public ownership. Even some comrades who have fought for it for many years also feel a sense of disappointment. In fact, as long as we compare the primary stage of socialism with the primary stage of capitalism, our thinking will become clear. The bourgeoisie's gentlemen and scholars also once fought for the establishment of the capitalist system with the ideal of "liberty, equality, fraternity." When capitalism covered society, the "liberty" they pursued became the workers' dependence on capital; the "equality" they pursued became the greatest polarization of wealth distribution in human history; the "fraternity" they pursued was manifested in several colonial wars and two world wars... While socialism appeared, it showed a brand-new face. Although reality has not met our expectations, this very fact, from one angle, shows that it contains great potential, waiting for us to "cash in."

Western prophets say that the communist experiment of the 20th century will end.

We, on the other hand, say with full confidence: "Give socialism time!"

    首钢启示录（下）
    ——从一个企业的改革看社会主义公有制优越性的发挥
    本报记者　艾丰
    “资产关切度”之辩
    “自己的东西自己爱，公家东西总比私人坏得快”。一些人看来，这个“私有逻辑”是铁的。
    “反正工厂不是我家的，倒闭有国家重新安排工作。”这是那份“私有制宣言”提出的论点之一。
    那么，公家的首钢有人爱吗？
    一位中央领导人在首钢作了调查之后，说：“这里人人都是财政部长。”
    首钢从比利时买进二手设备建成第二炼钢厂，动手到出钢只用了22个月。工程总指挥满开畺，在厂区连续奋战8个月没回家。当然，这样干的不止他一个。
    “早6晚8，星期天白搭”，或是“早6晚9，星期天不走”，是许多首钢干部的作息时间表。一位厂长告知家人这样的规矩：“吃饭别等我，回不回来别管我。”也曾有两位车间主任的妻子，气呼呼到工厂找星期天不回家的丈夫。当她们看到要骂的人身着工装、满脸汗污的样子，立刻明白了，流下了眼泪。首钢过春节，公司要慰问家属，人们借用歌词儿说，首钢的成绩，“有我的一半儿，也有你的一半儿”。
    有些工人自行车后边带着铁盒，上下班途中，见到废料就拣起来装进去，然后交到厂里。
    机关的信封，一般使用4次，也曾发现使用6次的。《首钢报》的稿纸是用一面有字的大样纸裁成的。很难想象这些细节竟然出现在一个每年上交数亿元的大企业……
    一位理论家，针对旧体制下的弊端，曾经提出了“资产关切度”的问题。企业的活力最终要表现在企业资产的增殖上，而这在很大程度上要靠职工的资产关切度。为了提高资产关切度，人们作了种种理论和实践的探讨。产权问题的提出，所有制改革的探讨，股份制的试点，相当程度缘此而出。
    首钢改革10年，固定资产净值靠自我积累由1978年的10.7亿元扩大到1988年的24亿元，增殖了1.5倍（不包括新并入的企业）。这里的种种事实，至少形成了这样的“一家之言”：并非只有改变所有制，更不是只有私有化，才能提高人们的资产关切度。在公有制的基础上，完全可以解决这个问题，关键是改革。
    “自己私有的企业自己才爱”，这是个体小生产的现实和心态。资本家企业的增殖也不靠这个逻辑，是靠剥削。“这是我的企业。”除了资本家，哪个工人可以说这句话？近年来他们搞的股份扩散，企业福利等等措施，其目的恰恰是要掩盖这句实质性的话。
    社会主义公有制，如果能找到好的体制，人们就会感到，企业这个“大家”和自己的“小家”融合在一起了，而且企业这个家是他们命运的更可靠的保障，是满足他们物质和精神需求的主要源泉，他们对“大家”的关切甚至超过对“小家”的关切，就是自然的了。
    这是对“个体私有”和“资本私有”两种逻辑的历史性超越！
    承包把思路继续打开
    首钢厂区巨大的标语牌上写着四个大字：“承包为本”。
    首钢承包制的实施过程，难免会遇到风风雨雨，对它所提供的理论、机制、具体办法，至今也还有不同层次的不同评价。全面的思考这一切，无疑对完善整个承包制有重要意义。
    其实，更具意义的恐怕是承包制为我国整个改革打开的思路。这里只举出首钢工作者提出的两三个颇具新意的观点。
    第一个观点，改革要注意发挥我们特有的优势。经济改革的基本方向，是要把产品经济转变为社会主义商品经济。因而引入市场机制，增强市场调节作用是非常必要和重要的。这方面要坚持做下去。但是，正如不能像过去对统一计划抱过分期望一样，对市场机制的作用也不可想得过“神”。况且，资本主义已把市场机制的作用发挥到淋漓尽致的地步，我们则实行计划和市场的结合。而首钢的承包，主要着眼于发挥社会主义公有制企业的两大特有优越性：三者利益一致的利益机制，广大职工当家作主的运行机制，竟能在并不好的市场条件下创造出相当好的经济效率和效益。　
　　人们都还记得60年代徐寅生写的《怎样打乒乓球》文章中关于“发挥特长”，“克服特短”的那些话。一个企业改革的思路是如此，整个改革的思路何尝不应如此呢？
    第二个观点，承包制有利于公有制企业和商品经济兼容。社会主义初级阶段，允许多种经济成分并存，但公有制毕竟是主体。改革的难点，就难在两者不兼容上，从企业看，就在它不能自负盈亏上。人们都承认，公有制企业往往负盈不负亏，更难以倒闭，市场竞争又奈它何？
    可否有一种新的自负盈亏观？《首钢10年改革基本总结》这份材料说，有。具体论述是：“首钢实行上交利润递增包干后，企业必须按照承包基数和递增率上交利润，如果完不成，就要用企业自有资金补足，企业的发展和工作者物质文化生活的改善都要受到影响；多超了，则超多少留多少。企业不仅承担亏损的责任，而且只有当盈利超过逐年递增的上交额时才能得到利益……这实际上是一种超出成本意义上的更高级的自负盈亏。”
    他们的观点起码值得重视和研讨。
    自负盈亏者，无非要使企业建立起激励和约束相结合的机制。合理的承包含有的这种机制并不少。首钢同志说：“有人说我们骄傲，其实递增指标压得我们没有骄傲的时间！”
    第三个观点，改革和稳定必须兼顾，承包制有利于处理好这个关系。旧体制不改，并不利于稳定。如果企业和职工要办的事情，都是通过“等、靠、要”的办法解决，就很容易发展成“怨、怠、闹”。吃社会主义又骂社会主义的现象，是旧体制给我们的惩罚。承包了，要获得的东西主要靠自己的劳动和创造去获得，怨、怠、闹没用了，起反作用了，也就没市场。有的人问几位首钢工人为什么前一段不去游行？他们说，我们要的东西，上街要不到，承包可得到……
    有一种幽默的说法，在大企业中，首钢是众多“黑乌鸦”中的一只“白乌鸦”。
    是说首钢条件特殊吗？询问结果，得知两条：有些承包企业是超收分成，首钢是超收全留；首钢钢材自销权是15％，高于其他同类企业。这两条有其历史成因。首钢开始承包时，钢材市场滞销，承包基数又大大超过前三年的平均值。不管怎样，总算得到一些“优惠”。现在的问题是，它仅仅靠喝这点“甜水”，而不是靠内在新的机制，羽毛就可以变得如此美丽吗？
    起关键作用的恐怕还是那些把两个基本点统一起来的带规律性的东西，这是首钢经验的实质。
    处于首钢的环境之中，不由得激起你为之呐喊的冲动，也同样会引发你更广泛的思考的欲望。
    毋庸讳言，近些年来，一些人似乎增长了对社会主义公有制困惑以至悲观情绪。甚至有的曾经为之奋斗多年的同志，也感到某种失望。其实，只要把社会主义初级阶段同资本主义初级阶段加以比较，思路就会开朗。资产阶级的志士仁人确也曾怀着“自由、平等、博爱”的理想，为建立资本主义制度而奋争。及至资本主义覆盖社会的时候，他们追求的“自由”却成了工人对资本的依附；他们追求的“平等”却成了人类历史上财富分配的最大的两极分化；他们追求的“博爱”竟体现为数次殖民战争和两次世界大战……而社会主义一出现，就显示出崭新的面貌。尽管现实并未满足我们的期望，但这正从一个角度说明，它包含的巨大可能性，正等待我们去“兑现”。
    西方预言家说，20世纪共产主义试验将结束。
    我们则满怀信心地说：“给社会主义以时间！”
