		Suspicion and Doubt

	One day, at the furniture exhibition and sales department of the Changguan Tower in Tianjin's Beining Park, various styles of "trendy" furniture were on display. Among the customers, Mr. Yang, a section chief from a certain company, had 2,000 yuan and wanted to buy a set of light-colored combined furniture. A set of elegant light tan combined furniture caught his eye. He looked at the price: 2,380 yuan.

		"Maybe I can haggle, and I can buy it for 2,000 yuan," Mr. Yang thought.

	At that moment, a salesperson walked over and said in a low voice, "If you plan to buy, 1,550 yuan and you can take it home."

		"Really?"

		"That's no lie! There are still four sets here, you can choose any one, and we will deliver it to your home after you choose."

		"Such a big discount? Could it be that it's not genuine material?" Mr. Yang muttered to himself. He knocked on this, touched that, and carefully examined every piece of wood...

	A young man pulled Mr. Yang to a set of lacquered furniture, pointing to the price on it and sincerely said:

		"You see, the selling price is 1,980 yuan, if you buy it, 1,300 yuan, how about it?"

	At this time, a few more salespeople gathered around, each introducing their own discount, immediately confusing Mr. Yang.

		"What's going on?" Mr. Yang didn't dare to buy and quickly left with the money, escaping this "place of dispute."

	In fact, these pieces of furniture were indeed genuine materials. It was just that the factory had accumulated inventory and had to painfully reduce the price to sell them, but the customers "buy high, not low."

		Waiting and Observing

	Before the National Day, in the electrical appliances department of Tianjin Department Store. Here, "Rainbow" brand 18-inch flat-angle remote control color TVs were being sold. The small notice read: The listed price is 2,945 yuan, the promotional price is 2,545 yuan, and a gift of a 400 yuan value TV antenna or a tape recorder is included.

	A couple from the suburbs stood there for a long time, holding a bulging black wallet, hesitating.

	The author talked with the male partner.

		"This price is okay, buy one!"

		"Who knows if the quality of this brand is good?"

		"I heard it's not bad."

		"Then why is it both discounted and giving away gifts?"

		"Maybe it's because too many were produced, and they are afraid of inventory."

		"Who would believe that!"

	After standing for a long time and not seeing anyone come to buy, the couple finally shook their heads and left.

	In theory, those who come to the store to buy a TV should have made up their minds, but the discount made them want to wait and see, and even doubt the quality of the TV.

	Looking back to this time last year, who had time to consider so much?

　　消费心理二则

      猜忌怀疑
    某日，天津北宁公园畅观楼家具展销部。各式各样的“新潮”家具琳琅满目。顾客中，某公司杨科长带两千块钱，想买一套浅色组合家具。一套设计典雅的浅驼色组合家具吸引了他的目光。一看标价：二千三百八十元。
      “或许还还价，两千块钱能买下来。”杨科长想。
    这时，一位卖主走过来低声说：“您打算买，一千五百五十块钱您拿走。”
      “真的？”
      “那还有假！现在这里还有四套，随您挑，挑好了我们给您送到家。”
      “‘幌子’这么大？莫非不是真材实料？”杨科长嘀咕了。他敲敲这，摸摸那，仔细察看每一块板材……
    一个小伙子凑到杨科长跟前，硬把他拽到一套大漆家具旁，指着上面的标价诚恳地说：
  “您看，卖价是一千九百八十块，您要是买，一千三百块钱怎么样？”
    此时，又有几个卖主围上来争着介绍自己的压价幅度，顿时把杨科长给说懵了。
      “这是怎么回事？”杨科长不敢买了，带着钱赶紧离开这块
  “是非之地”。
    其实，这些家具确是真材实料，只是由于生产厂家库存积压，只好忍痛降价出售，不料顾客“买涨不买落”。
      观望等待
    国庆节前夕，天津市百货大楼家电部。这里正在出售“彩虹”牌十八英寸平面直角带遥控彩色电视机。小字报上写着：牌价，二千九百四十五元，酬宾价二千五百四十五元，另赠送价值四百元的电视天线或录音机一台。
      一对郊县农民夫妇站在那里已多时，手里攥着鼓鼓囊囊的黑色皮夹，犹豫不决。
    笔者与男主人交谈。
      “这价还可以，买一台吧！”
      “谁知这牌子质量怎么样？”
      “听说还不错。”
      “那为什么又降价又赠送东西？”
      “可能是生产得太多了，怕积压。”
      “鬼才信！”
    站了半天也不见有人来买，农民夫妇终于摇着头离开那里。
    照理说，冲着买一台彩电来到商店，十有八九是打定了主意的，不想降价反而使他们产生了等一等，看一看，以至怀疑彩电质量的心理。
    回想去年此时此刻，谁又顾得上考虑这么多呢？
