Every summer is the peak season for thefts in Italy, and the increase in drug users has further expanded the ranks of thieves. According to the Italian Institute of Social and Economic Research, out of a population of 57 million, 1 million are suspected of being involved in criminal activities. Among them are those with extraordinary skills, the "three-handed" thieves, the elusive carjacking gangs, and the audacious robbers who ransack residential homes.

This summer, 42 French tourists visiting the famous city of Venice had their train compartment filled with "sleeping gas." When they woke up, they found that their jewelry and valuables had all disappeared. A West German tourist group traveling from Munich to Rome for a vacation discovered that all their luggage had been lost after getting off the train. It turned out that the luggage car had been unhooked, and all the items inside were stolen.

Instances of robbers ransacking vacationers' homes are also common. Therefore, Italians usually keep their vacation plans a secret. The Italian Consumers Association advises vacationers to leave at least 100,000 lira (70 dollars) in a conspicuous place in their rooms to prevent thieves from vandalizing the home if they cannot find valuable items. A chain store capitalized on this by attracting customers: during the peak tourist season, those who shop at the store and spend at least 30,000 lira (21 dollars) can get free home insurance from the store.

    意国窃贼何其多
    每年夏季是意大利的盗窃案频发期，吸毒者的增加使盗贼队伍进一步扩大。据意大利社会经济研究所透露，在5700万人口中竟有100万人涉嫌参与犯罪活动。他们中不乏神通广大的“三只手”、神出鬼没的飞车掠物帮和胆大包天、将居民住宅洗劫一空的江洋大盗。
    今夏，42名法国游客去名城威尼斯观光。他们的车厢被注入“睡气”，一觉醒来，发现身上的珠宝和贵重物品统统不翼而飞。从慕尼黑到罗马度假的某西德旅游团在下火车后发现行李全部丢失，原来行李车被人脱了钩，车中物品一扫而尽。
    洗劫度假者住宅的事例更是屡见不鲜，所以意大利人对外出度假的行期一向严守秘密。意大利消费者协会建议度假人在房间显眼的地方至少留下10万里拉（70美元），以防盗贼因找不到值钱的物品而对住宅施虐。一家联号百货商场乘机招徕顾客：在旅游旺季光顾该店并至少花掉3万里拉（21美元）者，可从该店获得免费住宅保险。　（新华社）
