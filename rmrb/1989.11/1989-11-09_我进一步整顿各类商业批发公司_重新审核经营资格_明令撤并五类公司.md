Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 8th.

The State Council recently approved and forwarded the Ministry of Commerce's "Opinions on Further Cleaning Up and Rectifying Various Commercial Wholesale Companies." This "Opinion" proposes that all companies engaged in domestic commercial wholesale business must undergo thorough cleaning and rectification. The scope includes various wholesale companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, joint venture companies, development companies, and other enterprises that, although not named as companies, primarily engage in wholesale business across various industries, departments, and economic components.

The "Opinion" stipulates that all commercial wholesale companies must be re-evaluated based on five conditions for their business qualifications:
1. Compliance with the "Regulations on the Administration of Enterprise Legal Person Registration" and its implementation rules.
2. Possession of facilities and storage, transportation equipment suitable for the scale of operations.
3. Availability of specialized technical personnel appropriate for the business.
4. Possession of commodity inspection and testing methods and personnel (or commissioning legal testing agencies for testing) suitable for the scope of operations. For certain special commodities, additional national regulations must be met.

The "Opinion" requires strict delineation of the business scope for commercial wholesale companies. State-monopolized and state-controlled commodities must be operated by designated commercial wholesale companies. For commodities under state planning, the planned portion must be operated by designated commercial wholesale companies. The State Council has specific regulations, which must be followed accordingly. Commodities closely related to people's daily lives must be operated by commercial wholesale companies designated by the provincial, autonomous region, and municipal governments, which will specify the types and scope. Certain special commodities (such as gasoline, diesel, kerosene, lubricating oil, Chinese and Western medicines, dangerous goods, labor protection products, etc.) must be operated by specialized wholesale companies designated by various levels of government. Wholesale companies established by production enterprises are only allowed to operate self-produced products that are permitted for self-sale after fulfilling state procurement tasks and are strictly prohibited from engaging in wholesale business unrelated to self-produced products. Private commercial enterprises and individual industrial and commercial households are strictly prohibited from engaging in wholesale business for the aforementioned four categories of commodities. A few that meet the conditions, after examination and approval, are allowed to engage in the wholesale business of certain liberalized commodities, with specific types and scope determined by the provincial, autonomous region, and municipal governments.

The Ministry of Commerce's "Opinion" clearly stipulates that five types of commercial wholesale companies must be resolutely dissolved or merged:
1. Various commercial wholesale companies established by party and government organs at all levels, mass organizations, and social groups must strictly follow the third clause of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Further Cleaning Up and Rectifying Companies."
2. Those that do not meet the requirements of the aforementioned third clause must be dissolved.
3. Those that exceed the business scope specified in the aforementioned fourth clause must be adjusted within a specified period. Those that cannot be adjusted must be dissolved.
4. Those engaged in illegal business activities such as speculation, buying and selling on credit, hoarding, and price gouging, which severely disrupt the market and have a negative social impact, must be dissolved.
5. Those that, due to poor management, have incurred long-term losses and are insolvent must be dissolved or merged.

    重新审核经营资格  明令撤并五类公司
    新华社北京11月8日电  国务院最近批转了商业部《关于进一步清理整顿各类商业批发公司的意见》，这一《意见》提出，所有从事国内商业批发业务的公司，都要进行认真的清理整顿，其范围包括各行业、各部门、各种经济成分的各类批发公司、供销公司、联营公司、开发公司，以及其他不以公司为名实际上主要从事批发业务的企业。
    《意见》规定，要按照五个条件重新审核所有商业批发公司的经营资格：符合《中华人民共和国企业法人登记管理条例》及其实施细则的规定；具备与经营规模相适应的场所和仓储运输设施；具有与经营业务相适应的专门业务技术人员；具备与经营范围相适应的商品检验、检测手段和人员（或委托合法检测单位进行检测）。经营某些特殊性商品，还必须符合国家的专项规定。
    《意见》要求，严格划定商业批发公司的经营范围。国家专营专卖的商品，由国家指定的商业批发公司经营；国家计划管理商品的计划内部分，由国家指定的商业批发公司经营，国务院有专门规定，按国务院的规定执行；与人民生活关系密切的必需品，由省、自治区、直辖市人民政府规定品种及范围，并指定商业批发公司经营；某些特殊性商品（如汽油、柴油、煤油、润滑油、中西药品、危险品、劳动保护用品等），由各级政府指定的专门批发公司经营；生产企业开办的商业批发公司，只准经营在完成国家收购任务的前提下允许自销的自产产品，一律不得从事与自产产品无关的批发业务；私营商业企业和个体工商户，一律不准经营上述前四项商品的批发业务；少数具备条件的，经审查批准，允许经营某些放开商品的批发业务，具体品种和范围由省、自治区、直辖市人民政府自定。
    商业部的《意见》明确规定，五类商业批发公司坚决予以撤、并：
    （一）各级党政机关、群众组织、社会团体开办的各类商业批发公司，严格按照中共中央、国务院《关于进一步清理整顿公司的决定》第三条执行；
    （二）不符合上述第三条要求的，予以撤销；
    （三）超出上述第四条经营范围的，限期调整；无法调整的，予以撤销；
    （四）投机倒把、买空卖空、高价抢购、囤积居奇、哄抬物价等严重违法经营，扰乱市场，社会影响很坏的，一律予以撤销；
    （五）由于经营管理不善，造成长期亏损，资不抵债的，予以撤销或合并。
