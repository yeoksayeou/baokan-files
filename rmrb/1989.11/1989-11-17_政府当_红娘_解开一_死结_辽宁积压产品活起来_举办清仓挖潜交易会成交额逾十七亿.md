Title: The Government as Matchmaker: Unraveling a Knot

In the face of numerous difficulties confronting industrial enterprises, two new challenges have emerged: the difficulty of selling industrial products and the difficulty of purchasing them. Those who want to sell cannot, and those who want to buy do not have the money, leading to a situation where products are piled up and funds are stagnant. This has created another knot in the interlocked chain of production and supply.

Good news has come from the recently concluded Liaoning Province Clearance and Potential Utilization Commodity Exchange Fair: within just eight days, the total transaction amount between supply and demand sides reached 1.75 billion yuan, equivalent to half of the additional loans obtained by industrial enterprises in Liaoning Province in the first ten months of this year. On average, more than 200 million yuan worth of piled-up products and excess inventory found buyers each day, putting them to good use. How was this knot of piled-up and excess inventory untied?

Finding a "match" for piled-up products and excess inventory, with the government acting as a matchmaker to facilitate connections, is an effective approach. In the second half of this year, due to market sluggishness, the volume of piled-up products in Liaoning's industrial enterprises surged. In reality, not all unsold products are "ugly ducks." One of the main reasons for the accumulation of some products is the lack of information between buyers and sellers. At this exchange fair, more than 2,500 enterprises from 14 cities showcased 3.94 billion yuan worth of piled-up products and excess inventory, either by displaying the actual items or by posting supply details, making them visible to customers from within and outside the province. This immediately created a highly active trading scene. Many factory directors' frowns turned into smiles.

Economic departments providing coordinated services on-site can act as a fulcrum for economic levers, greatly aiding in untangling the knot of piled-up and excess inventory. During the exchange fair, departments such as pricing, finance, taxation, and credit in Liaoning all set up on-site service counters. Because buyers and sellers met face-to-face at the exchange fair, departments like pricing, finance, and taxation could see the issues clearly and take measures that had immediate effects. A loan issued by a bank often untangled several knots in the supply chain of enterprises. For example, Jinzhou Textile Mill, Anshan Chemical Fiber Spinning Mill, and Dalian Dyed Fabric Mill had issues with either piled-up products or a lack of funds to purchase raw materials. The bank, considering the interlinked nature of their production, issued a single loan that revitalized all three enterprises, truly a case of "one stone, three birds."

    政府当“红娘”  解开一“死结”
    辽宁积压产品活起来
    举办清仓挖潜交易会成交额逾十七亿
    据新华社沈阳11月16日电　（记者周保华、马义）在工业企业面临的诸多困难中，如今又添两难：工业产品卖难，买难。想卖的卖不出，欲购者又无钱，从而导致产品积压，资金呆滞，在环环相扣的生产供应链上出现了又一“死结”。
    日前结束的辽宁省清仓挖潜物资商品交易会传来令人振奋的消息：在短短的8天中，供需双方成交总额达17.5亿元，相当于今年前10个月全省工业企业增加的贷款的一半。平均每天就有价值2亿多元的积压产品和超储物资找到买主，派上了用场。超储积压物资的“死结”在这里是怎样被解开的呢？
    为积压产品、超储物资找“婆家”，由政府出面穿针引线当“红娘”，是一个好办法。今年下半年，由于市场出现销售疲软现象，辽宁工业企业积压产品骤增。其实“嫁”不出去的并非都是“丑姑娘”。购销双方信息不灵通，是一部分产品积压的重要原因，在这次交易会上，来自14个市2500多家企业把价值39.4亿元的积压产品、超储物资，或摆放实物，或张贴供货细目，公诸省内外客户面前，立即出现了空前活跃的交易场面。不少企业的厂长愁眉变成了笑脸。
    经济部门成龙配套到现场，为经济杠杆选准“支点”，就能为解开超储积压物资“死结”发挥很大的启动力。交易会期间，辽宁的物价、财政、税收、信贷等部门都到现场挂牌服务。由于交易会上买卖双方见面，物价、金融、税收等部门问题看得准，采取一个措施，就能收到立竿见影的效果。银行发放一笔贷款，往往就能解开几个企业供求链上的“死结”。金州纺织厂、鞍山化纤毛纺厂和大连色织布厂有的产品积压，有的无钱买原料，银行根据其生产一环扣一环的特点，只给一笔贷款就使3家企业活了起来，真可谓“一石三鸟”。
