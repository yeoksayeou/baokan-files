The Ministry of Health held a symposium for medical personnel today and issued a notice to medical and health departments at all levels nationwide, calling on them to learn from the international communist fighter Dr. Norman Bethune.

November 12 marks the 50th anniversary of the death of the great international communist fighter Dr. Norman Bethune. To carry out the important instructions of Comrade Deng Xiaoping that medical personnel should "be revolutionary fighters like Dr. Norman Bethune and scientists like Dr. Norman Bethune," to do a good job in medical and health work, and to better serve the people's health, it is required that medical personnel nationwide improve their political quality, establish a great communist ideal, and adhere to the socialist direction of health work.

The notice emphasizes that learning from Dr. Norman Bethune should be combined with learning from advanced and model figures in China's health sector.

The notice points out that medical work is highly scientific, and medical personnel must have a rigorous work style and a practical attitude. Young medical workers, in particular, must work hard on basic theories, basic skills, and basic operations to serve the people with solid abilities.

At the symposium, veteran medical workers Wang Kangju and Dai Zhengqi, who had fought alongside Comrade Dr. Norman Bethune, emotionally recalled Dr. Norman Bethune's noble medical ethics and selfless spirit of dedication.

    本报北京11月10日讯　记者艾笑报道：卫生部今天召开医务人员座谈会，并向全国各级医疗卫生部门发出通知，号召向国际共产主义战士白求恩学习。
    今年11月12日是伟大的国际共产主义战士白求恩逝世50周年纪念日。为贯彻邓小平同志关于医务人员要“做白求恩式的革命者，做白求恩式的科学家”的重要指示，搞好医疗卫生工作，更好地为人民健康服务，要求全国医疗战线职工提高政治素质，树立共产主义远大理想，坚持卫生工作的社会主义方向。
    通知强调，学习白求恩要与学习我国卫生战线的先进模范人物相结合。
    通知指出，医务工作是一个科学性很强的工作，医务人员必须要有严谨的工作作风，求实的工作态度。青年医务工作者更要在基本理论、基本技能、基本操作上下硬功夫，以过硬的本领服务于人民。
    座谈会上，曾经和白求恩同志共同战斗过的老一辈医务工作者王康久、戴正启等同志深情地回顾了白求恩同志的高尚医德和无私的奉献精神。
