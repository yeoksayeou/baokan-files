Picasso's batch of masterpieces were stolen on the 5th from his granddaughter Marina's residence. In addition to the art master's oil paintings, there were also other precious artworks, totaling around fifteen pieces, valued at over one billion francs. This case is known as the largest art theft of the century.

Marina Picasso resides in a villa in Cannes, southern France. This weekend, she happened to be out on vacation. The gatekeeper went into the city at 7 PM and returned fifty minutes later to find the house had been burglarized. The police searched and concluded that this was a meticulously planned theft, with the thieves being very familiar with the villa's layout and the owner's habits.

    毕加索的一批名画五日在其孙女玛丽娜的寓所被窃，除了艺术大师的油画外，还有一批其它珍贵艺术品，共十五件左右，价值上亿法郎。此案被称为本世纪最大的艺术品盗窃案。
    玛丽娜·毕加索居住在法国南部戛纳的一幢别墅内，本周末她正好外出度假。守门人晚上七时进城，五十分钟回来后发现家中被盗。警方搜索后认为，这是一次精心组织的盗窃活动，窃贼相当熟悉别墅内情况及主人生活习惯。
