	Dr. Wastell from Plymouth, UK, recently conducted an interesting study in collaboration with midwives.
	His findings confirm that infants who are fortunate enough to be immediately hugged by their mothers after birth (mostly rural infants delivered by traditional midwives) eat more, cry less, sleep better, and grow faster during the entire breastfeeding period compared to infants who are immediately taken to a warm room after birth (mostly urban infants delivered in modern obstetric hospitals).
	Dr. Wastell's subsequent research also shows that infants who are frequently hugged by their mothers (or fathers and other relatives) during the breastfeeding period exhibit more normal growth in both physical and mental aspects.
	Experts' brainwave tests on infants indicate that infants begin to respond sensitively to their surroundings immediately after birth, becoming both sensitive and anxious psychologically. Therefore, it is crucial for these newborns to receive maternal affection in that critical moment after birth.
	Based on this theory, Dr. Wastell suggests that midwives in modern obstetric hospitals should learn from traditional midwives to allow the mother to quietly hug the infant for 20 minutes after the umbilical cord is cut, before taking the infant to the warm room (if the mother undergoes a cesarean section and cannot hug the infant herself, the father or a nurse should hold the infant for a while). Dr. Wastell also emphasizes that if the infant is too weak to be hugged, the mother can look at the child and "talk" to him, and hug and touch him as soon as possible afterward.
	Coincidentally, Swedish psychologist Dr. Ragnhild Päivärinta discovered in a study that infants during the breastfeeding period not only need frequent hugs from their relatives but also that the "posture" of these hugs significantly affects the infant's growth.
	Through statistics, he pointed out that if parents habitually hug the infant on their left side, the infant will cry less, sleep better, gain weight faster, have stronger immunity, and even show superior intellectual development (walking and speaking earlier).
	He explained that infants, after leaving the womb, long to hear their mother's heartbeat again. Once the infant is hugged on the adult's left side, he can clearly feel the adult's heartbeat, and the bond that was once severed with the mother is reestablished, giving the infant a sense of psychological "security"—undoubtedly, this is very beneficial for the child's physical and mental health. He also suggests that adults who habitually "hug on the right" should try to change their hugging posture to help the infant grow and develop more healthily.

　　搂抱婴儿好处多
　　孙晓萍
    英国普利茅斯的华斯特医生最近在助产士的合作下进行了一项有趣的研究。
    他的结果证实：出生后有幸立即被母亲搂抱的婴儿（多为经接生婆按照传统办法接生的农村婴儿）比出生后立即被抱往暖房的婴儿（多为在产科医院按照现代办法接生的城市婴儿）在整个婴儿哺乳期吃得多、哭得少、睡得好、长得快。
    华斯特医生在此后所作的进一步研究还显示，在哺乳期经常被母亲（或父亲及其他亲人）搂抱的婴儿在身心两方面的成长都明显地“更为正常”。
    专家们对婴儿所作的脑电波测定表明，婴儿一离娘胎便开始对周围世界作出灵敏反应，在心理上会显得既敏感又紧张，因而在这小生命诞生后的那关键一刻中，能否立即获得母亲的抚爱便十分重要。
    据此理论，华斯特医生建议现代化的产科医院的助产士向接生婆学习，在剪除脐带后让婴儿由母亲安安静静地先搂抱20分钟，此后再送往暖房（要是产妇遇剖腹产而不能亲自搂抱婴儿，则最好父亲或护士代抱一会儿）。华斯特医生还强调，如果婴儿体质太差而不宜被大人搂抱，那么母亲不妨一边望着孩子一边与他“对话”，此后一有可能便尽快搂抱、抚摸他。
    无独有偶，瑞典心理学家拉奈特·帕果伦博士在一项研究中还发现，处在哺乳期的婴儿不仅需要亲人经常的搂抱，而且亲人搂抱的“姿势”也对婴儿的生长“影响明显”。
    通过统计他指出，如果双亲习惯于把婴儿搂抱于自身左侧，那么婴儿啼哭较少，睡眠较好，体重增加较快，抵抗力较强，甚至智力发育也明显占优（以后学步和开始说话都较早）。
    对此他解释说，离开了母腹的婴儿渴望着重新听到母亲的心跳声，一旦婴儿被搂抱在大人左侧，他便能清楚地感到大人的心跳，与母亲一度脱离的纽带便重新联结了起来，一种心理上的“安全感”便油然而生——无疑，这对孩子的生理和心理健康都大有裨益。他还建议习惯于“右侧抱”的成年人应尽量改变搂抱姿势，以帮助婴儿更健康地生长发育。
