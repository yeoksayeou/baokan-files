    China's Self-Designed, Fabricated, Installed, and Debugged
    Lanzhou Heavy Ion Accelerator to Begin Official Operation
    This is the Third Such Device in the World After France and Japan

    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, November 10 - (Reporters Tian Hengjiang, Correspondent Song Wenjie) The Lanzhou Heavy Ion Accelerator project passed the national acceptance committee's completion inspection today. This set of equipment, which is currently the highest energy, most diverse in accelerated ion types, and largest in scale heavy ion accelerator in China, will now enter official operation.

    Prior to this, the national acceptance committee had, on the 9th, approved the technical inspection of the accelerator project.

    The Lanzhou Heavy Ion Accelerator was designed, fabricated, installed, and debugged by the broad masses of scientific and technical personnel and workers of the Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, based on the digestion and absorption of advanced foreign scientific and technological achievements. Adhering to the principle of self-reliance and frugal construction, they overcame numerous difficulties and completed the project in 13 years, achieving beam output in December 1988. It is the third such large-scale cyclotron in the world after those in France and Japan.

    The heavy ion accelerator is an indispensable important device for basic research in heavy ion nuclear physics and applied research using heavy ion beams. Heavy ion beams have wide applications in solid-state physics, atomic physics, molecular physics, materials science, radiation biology, radiation medicine, and many aspects of agricultural and industrial production.

    After nearly 5000 hours of trial operation, the acceleration level of the Lanzhou Heavy Ion Accelerator has been continuously improved, and its technical parameters have fully met the design requirements. The beam intensity and quality have also reached the design indicators. Researchers have used the heavy ion beam accelerated by this domestically produced equipment to carry out three medium-energy heavy ion nuclear reaction studies and one material irradiation damage study, opening a new chapter in China's research in this field.

    The national acceptance committee, after listening to two reports from the Chinese Academy of Sciences on technical inspection and project completion review, inspected the accelerator site and conducted a comprehensive discussion and acceptance of various inspection test results, technological equipment, project quality, financial budget, material management, and archival materials. They concluded that the entire project construction task has been completed according to the design plan. The design layout is reasonable, the facilities are fully equipped, and the construction quality is good. The main accelerator and its various systems have fully reached the design indicators, and the performance indicators have reached the international advanced level of similar accelerators in the 1980s, making China's self-designed and built heavy ion cyclotron accelerator enter the world's advanced ranks. The radiation protection system is designed reasonably, the equipment is complete, the technology is advanced, and it meets national regulations and standards, posing no harmful effects on the environment.

    The Chinese Academy of Sciences today simultaneously issued a commendation order, commending all scientific and technical personnel, workers, and cadres who participated in the research and construction of the Lanzhou Heavy Ion Accelerator.

    我国自行设计、加工、安装和调试
    兰州重离子加速器将正式运行
    这是世界上继法国日本后的第三台同类装置
    新华社兰州11月10日电  （记者田恒江、通讯员宋文杰）兰州重离子加速器工程，今天通过了国家鉴定委员会的竣工验收，这套迄今我国能量最高、加速离子种类最多、规模最大的重离子加速装置，即可投入正式运行。
    在此之前，国家鉴定委员会曾于9日通过了对加速器工程的工艺技术鉴定。
    兰州重离子加速器是中国科学院近代物理研究所广大科技人员和工人在消化吸收国外先进科学技术的基础上，坚持自力更生、勤俭建国方针，自行设计、加工、安装和调试，经过13个寒暑的艰苦努力，于1988年12月建成出束的。是世界上继法国、日本之后的第三台同类大型回旋加速器。
    重离子加速器是重离子核物理基础研究和重离子束应用研究中必不可少的重要装置。重离子束在固体物理、原子物理、分子物理、材料科学、辐射生物学、辐射医学，以及工农业生产的许多方面，都有着广泛的用途。
    经过近5000个小时的试运行，兰州重离子加速器的加速水平不断提高，技术参数全面达到设计要求；束流强度及其品质也都达到了设计指标。科研人员用这台国产设备加速的重离子束流已开展了三项中能重离子核反应研究和一项材料辐照损伤研究，揭开了我国在这一领域开展研究的新篇章。
    国家验收委员会今天在听取了中科院关于工艺技术鉴定和工程竣工审查两个报告后，察看了加速器现场，对各项鉴定测试结果、工艺设备、工程质量、财务预决算、物资管理和档案资料等，进行了全面审议和验收。认为整个工程建设任务已经按设计规划全部完成，其设计布局合理，设施配套齐全，施工质量良好。主加速器及其各系统全面达到了设计指标，性能指标达到80年代同类加速器的国际先进水平，从而使我国自行设计、建造的重离子回旋加速器进入世界先进行列。辐射防护系统设计合理，设备齐全，技术先进，符合国家规定标准，对环境不会造成有害影响。
    中国科学院今天同时发布嘉奖令，对参加研制和建造兰州重离子加速器的全体科技人员、工人和干部予以嘉奖。
