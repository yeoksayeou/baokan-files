The four-party trade talks involving representatives from Japan, the United States, Canada, and the European Community concluded in Hakone, Japan, on the 14th. The conference, which began on the evening of the 12th, saw participants engaging in substantive discussions over the course of three days. The talks focused on how to advance the new multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Uruguay Round), scheduled to conclude by the end of next year. All parties agreed on the need to strengthen trade management, eliminate trade imbalances, and promote sustained economic growth in each country to ensure the success of this round of trade negotiations.

However, significant differences remained among the representatives when it came to discussions on specific negotiation areas.

    日美加欧在日本讨论贸易问题
    由日本、美国、加拿大和欧洲共同体四方贸易谈判代表参加的四方贸易会议十四日在日本箱根闭幕。
    这次会议是从十二日晚开幕的，在三天的会议期间，与会各方代表围绕如何推进定于明年底结束的关贸总协定新多边贸易谈判（乌拉圭回合）展开了实质性的讨论，一致认为有必要加强贸易管理，消除贸易不平衡，促进各国经济的持续增长，以促使这轮贸易谈判取得成功。
    但是，各方代表在就具体谈判领域的讨论中仍旧分歧很大。
