The Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee's Tenth Session passed the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Assemblies, Processions, and Demonstrations" with an overwhelming majority of 103 votes and put it into effect.

After ten months of gestation, it was finally born. As early as ten years ago, when the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee proposed strengthening the process of democratic and legal construction, China's legislative body proposed drafting a law on assemblies, processions, and demonstrations: the Constitution grants citizens the right to assemble, process, and demonstrate, which needs legal protection; and in a country with 1.1 billion people, the exercise of this right must have a unified standard and a law to follow. Therefore, the National People's Congress Law Committee conducted a series of investigations and research, and held several expert seminars on this issue. After several revisions, the draft was submitted to the Eighth and Ninth Sessions of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee for discussion. In July of this year, the draft of the Law on Assemblies, Processions, and Demonstrations was published nationwide to solicit opinions for revision from citizens across the country. During this period, the National People's Congress Law Committee, the Internal Affairs and Justice Committee, and the Legal Work Committee invited leaders from the municipal committees, governments, and standing committees of the people's congresses of Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, Wuhan, Chengdu, Changsha, Hefei, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Taiyuan, as well as relevant law enforcement departments, to hold special seminars. They also invited leaders of some colleges and universities, legal experts and scholars, and leaders of various democratic parties and mass organizations to solicit opinions. At the same time, many citizens also expressed their views to the legislative departments through written letters and other means. Therefore, the draft of the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Assemblies, Processions, and Demonstrations" submitted to the Tenth Session for deliberation by the National People's Congress Law Committee is a text that has undergone multiple discussions and revisions. The commissioners generally believe that this text is legal, reasonable, and in line with the needs of China's national conditions and the interests of the people, making the guarantee and restriction complementary, reflecting the relationship between democracy and the rule of law.

Democracy and the rule of law are a pair of "twin sisters," and guarantee and restriction are two inseparable aspects. At the Ninth and Tenth Sessions of the Standing Committee, the commissioners discussed the most about the relationship between guarantee and restriction, and the opinions from the grassroots and the general public were mainly in this area. Therefore, the first article of this revised draft changed from the original draft's "In order to maintain public order and social tranquility, to smoothly carry out the modernization of socialism, to guarantee citizens' right to assemble, process, and demonstrate according to law, and to formulate this law according to the Constitution" to "In order to guarantee citizens' right to assemble, process, and demonstrate according to law, to maintain social stability and public order, and to formulate this law according to the Constitution." Vice Chairman of the Law Committee, Song Ruyi, once said that the core issue of this law is the relationship between guarantee and restriction. Many people mentioned that there should be a correct view on assemblies, processions, and demonstrations, and the relationship between modernization and democracy should be correctly understood. If the issue of processions and demonstrations is handled well, it can play a role in supervising the government, opposing bureaucracy and corruption, and promoting government work improvement, which is also conducive to the stability and unity of the country. Some commissioners pointed out that when the people generally recognize the importance of this law in guaranteeing citizens' rights and maintaining the long-term stability of the country, they can accept it from the heart and actively promote its implementation.

The commissioners noted that this revised draft submitted for deliberation pays great attention to the opinions of the masses. The original draft's 22 "shall not" clauses were reduced to 12. This is exactly what many discussion opinions proposed. At the same time, the legal liability item was strengthened, making the original draft's relatively vague and difficult-to-execute clauses more specific, and making different provisions for the application of relevant criminal law clauses according to the different nature of illegal acts. Additionally, a separate clause was added: "Those who disturb, rush, or use other methods to disrupt assemblies, processions, and demonstrations held in accordance with the law shall be subject to a warning or detention of no more than fifteen days by the public security organs; if the circumstances are serious and constitute a crime, criminal liability shall be investigated according to the relevant provisions of the criminal law."

The commissioners mentioned the issue of serious implementation after having a legal basis. Vice Chairman Wang Hanbin once said that the formulation of laws must consider implementation and achieve order and prohibition. Legal assemblies and processions should be allowed, and illegal ones should be firmly not allowed. Commissioner Song Yiping said that it is not possible to only allow assemblies and processions organized by state organs, political parties, social organizations, etc., while generally prohibiting assemblies and processions organized by citizens themselves. This law guarantees citizens' legal rights while also restricting some negative effects. Restriction is also for the sake of guarantee. The correct implementation of this law will play a positive role in guaranteeing citizens' rights and maintaining the stability and unity of the country and society.

    忠实遵循宪法的原则
    ——全国人大常委会审议集会游行示威法侧记
    晓渡　阎军
    在七届全国人大第十次常委会上，《中华人民共和国集会游行示威法》以103票的压倒多数通过，并付诸实施。
    十月怀胎，一朝分娩。早在10年前，当党的十一届三中全会提出加强民主与法制建设进程时，我国立法机构就提出制定一个集会游行示威法：宪法赋予公民的集会游行示威权利，需要有法律保障；而在一个有11亿人口的大国，对行使这项权利又必须有个统一规范和可以遵循的法律。于是，全国人大法律委员会就此作了一系列调查、研究工作，并召开若干次专家座谈会。这项法律起草后，几次易稿，先后交付七届全国人大常委会第八、九次会议讨论。今年7月，又向全国公布了集会游行示威法草案，征求全国公民的修改意见。在这期间，全国人大法律委员会、内务司法委员会和法制工作委员会，曾邀请上海、天津、南京、武汉、成都、长沙、合肥、西安、兰州、太原十城市的市委、市政府、市人大常委会，以及有关执法部门的负责人举行专门座谈，还邀请一些大专院校的负责干部、法律专家学者，以及各民主党派和群众团体的负责同志征求意见。与此同时，许多群众也以书面来信等形式，向立法部门表达了自己的看法。因此，人大法律委员会提交第十次会议审议的《中华人民共和国集会游行示威法（草案）》，是一个经过多次讨论、修改的文本。委员们普遍认为：这个文本合法、合情、合理，符合我国国情和人民利益的需要，使保障和限制相辅相成，体现了民主与法制的关系。
    民主与法制是一对“孪生姐妹”，而保障与限制又是不可分割的两个方面。在人大常委会第九、十次会议上，委员们对集会游行示威法谈论最多的，正是保障与限制的关系，而来自基层和广大群众的意见，主要也在这方面。因此，这次修改稿的第一条，就由原公布草案的“为了维护公共秩序和社会安宁，顺利地进行社会主义现代化建设，保障公民依法行使集会、游行、示威的权利，根据宪法规定，制定本法”，改为“为了保障公民依法行使集会、游行、示威的权利，维护社会安定和公共秩序，根据宪法，制定本法。”法律委员会副主任委员宋汝棼曾就此说到，这个法律核心的问题是保障和限制的关系问题。许多人都提到，对集会、游行、示威应该有个正确的看法，要正确认识现代化和民主的关系。游行示威问题处理得好，可以起到监督政府、反对官僚主义和腐败现象、促进政府改进工作的作用，也有利于国家的安定团结。有的委员指出，当人民群众普遍认识这项法律对保障公民权利和维护国家长治久安有重要意义时，就能够从内心接受，并积极推进这个法的贯彻实施。
    委员们注意到，这次提交审议的修改稿，十分重视群众的意见。原草案中22个“不得”二字，减少到12个。这正是许多讨论意见所提出的。同时，强化了法律责任一项，使得原草案比较笼统、难以执行的条款更加具体化，而按违法行为的不同性质分别作出适用刑法有关条款的规定，并且单独补充了一条，即“扰乱、冲击或者以其他方法破坏依法举行的集会、游行、示威的，公安机关可以处以警告或者十五日以下拘留；情节严重，构成犯罪的，依照刑法有关规定追究刑事责任。”
    委员们提到有了法律依据以后认真执行的问题。王汉斌副委员长曾说，制定法律就要考虑执行，做到令行禁止。合法的集会游行应当允许，不合法的就坚决不允许。宋一平委员说，不能只允许国家机关、政党、社会团体等组织的集会游行，而公民自己组织的集会游行就一概禁止。这个法保障公民的合法权利，同时也限制某些消极的作用，限制也是为了保障。这个法的正确执行，对保障公民权利、维护国家社会的安定团结都将起到积极作用。
