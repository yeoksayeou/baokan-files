Gorbachev Meets with French Foreign Minister
Criticizes Western Export of Capitalism

	MOSCOW, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- Soviet leader Gorbachev criticized the West for "replacing accusations of 'exporting revolution' with calls to 'export capitalism'" on Nov. 14. He said, "This is a dangerous product of old thinking."

	According to TASS, Gorbachev made these remarks during a meeting with French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas. He added, "Different societies have beneficial experiences in solving various problems, and the art of modern politics lies in using these for the benefit of oneself and others."

	In discussing Soviet-French relations, he said that strengthening dialogue between the two countries is necessary at this time, and therefore, a new meeting with the French president is very timely.

	Dumas arrived in the Soviet Union this morning for an official visit. He first held talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. From the TASS report, it can be seen that the current situation in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, as well as East-West relations, are the main issues discussed by the Soviet and French foreign ministers, with significant differences in their positions.

	The Soviet foreign minister expressed hope that the West would "constructively understand the situation in Eastern Europe." He believed that "some people in the Federal Republic of Germany are raising the issue of German reunification as a current political problem, which is very worrying."

	He accused some of wanting to "question the existence of the sovereign state of the German Democratic Republic and the entire European territorial and political structure."

	French Foreign Minister Dumas left the Soviet Union for home late on Nov. 14.

    戈尔巴乔夫接见法国外长
    批评西方输出资本主义
    新华社莫斯科11月14日电　苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫14日在这里批评西方“用号召‘输出资本主义’代替对‘输出革命’的指责。”他说，“这是旧思维的危险产物。”
    据塔斯社报道，戈尔巴乔夫是在接见法国外长迪马时发表这一见解的。他还说，“不同的社会都有解决各种不同问题的有益经验，现代政治的艺术在于以此为自己和大家造福”。
    他在谈到苏法关系时说，当前需要加强两国对话，因此，同法国总统举行新的会晤是十分及时的。
    迪马今天上午抵苏进行正式访问。他先同苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽举行了会谈。从塔斯社报道可以看出，当前苏联和东欧的形势以及东西方关系是苏法外长讨论的主要问题，双方立场差异颇大。
    苏联外长表示，苏联指望西方“建设性地理解东欧的事态”。他认为，“联邦德国的某些人士把德国统一问题作为眼前政治问题提出，这种做法令人极为担忧”。
    他指责有人“想对民主德国这一主权国家的存在以及整个欧洲的领土和政治体制提出疑问”。
    法国外长已于14日晚离开苏联回国。
