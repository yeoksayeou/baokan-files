A Blazing Flame Illuminates China
— In Praise of the Television Series *Li Dazhao*
Wāng Suìhán

October 29th marked the 100th anniversary of Comrade Li Dazhao's birth. On this day, the Beijing Television Art Center and three other units collaborated to produce a television drama named after Li Dazhao, which holds significant importance.

For a long time, many comrades, including some party members, have known little about Li Dazhao, one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party. Now, 40 years after the founding of the nation, it is time for us to learn about him. The best visual educational material for this purpose is the 9-episode television series *Li Dazhao*.

As Comrade Li Yunchang mentioned at the premiere, both Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu are founders of our party, but Li Dazhao remained steadfast throughout, while Chen Duxiu did not.

This television drama deeply moved me to tears. The drama employs a "layered structure," seamlessly blending Li Dazhao's revolutionary history with the process of two sculptors' evolving understanding of Li Dazhao while creating his statue. This process naturally becomes the audience's journey to understanding Li Dazhao's revolutionary achievements. It is indeed a successful historical educational material for the party.

Li Dazhao was born in 1889 and died at the age of 38. Few people know that the name "Chinese Communist Party" was chosen by Li Dazhao. Even fewer know that the gallows used to execute Li Dazhao were imported from an imperialist country by the warlords. At the beginning of the drama, a truck arrives, and the Fengtian warlord Zhang Zuolin orders the opening of a long box on the truck, revealing a chilling foreign gallows.

The drama concludes with Li Dazhao fearlessly walking towards the gallows. According to the *Morning Post* at the time, "The first to ascend the gallows was Li Dazhao. It was reported that Li's expression did not change," as he calmly met his end. Before his execution, various parties attempted to rescue him. A petition signed by 300 of Li Dazhao's fellow townspeople, including Bai Meiyi, stated: "Li Dazhao endured hardships, wearing a single quilted jacket in winter and a single cotton shirt in summer. The hardships he endured are beyond description." After his execution, various newspapers reported: "Li Dazhao never saved money, and his home was extremely modest." His residence was "barely furnished, and what little there was, was very worn out." "His children's clothing was simple, reflecting his frugal lifestyle."

The style of the entire television series is as simple and steadfast as Li Dazhao himself, without any intention to attract attention. It embodies the ambition of "carrying the burden of justice on iron shoulders and writing articles with skillful hands" (a couplet written by Li Dazhao). Watching all 9 episodes, each one is captivating, like a blazing flame that can ignite our spirits and inspire us to learn from Li Dazhao's revolutionary sacrifice.

After watching the entire series, one cannot help but admire the acting skills of the actor Li Xuejian, who played Li Dazhao. Every word, smile, and gesture he delivered exuded the spirit of the heroic and tragic songs of Yan and Zhao, while also embodying the heart of a loyal son fighting for the party and the people throughout his life. Li Xuejian's acting skills are among the best in the country. He is always immersed in the spirit of Li Dazhao. As I watched, I deeply believed that the person on the screen was the true Li Dazhao.

Comrade Jiang Zemin said: "Li Dazhao is not only a scholar with profound knowledge but also, above all, an outstanding warrior. 'The glorious image of Comrade Li Dazhao will forever inspire us to press forward bravely!'"

I sincerely hope that all the people of our country, especially the young friends, can watch this 9-episode television series *Li Dazhao*.

    一团烈火燃神州
    ——赞电视连续剧《李大钊》
    汪岁寒
    10月29日是李大钊同志诞生百年纪念日。在这个日子里，北京电视艺术中心等4个单位同心协力推出了以李大钊命名的电视剧，其意义是非常重大的。
    长期以来，不少同志也包括一部分党员，对这位中国共产党的创始人之一李大钊却所知不多。建国已经40周年了，让我们补上这一课吧。而这次补课最好的形象教材莫过于这部9集连续剧《李大钊》了。
    正如李运昌同志在此剧首映式上讲的，李大钊和陈独秀都是我们党的创始人，但李大钊有始有终，而陈独秀却有始无终。
    这部电视剧使我受到深切感染而潸然泪下。这部电视剧的结构是“套层结构”，将大钊同志的革命历史和两位雕塑家在创作李大钊同志的塑像先后的认识过程严密地融合在一起，这一认识过程又自然地成为观众认识李大钊同志革命伟绩的过程。它不愧为成功的党史形象教材。
    大钊同志生于1889年，牺牲时才38岁。可很少有人知道“中国共产党”这个名称是大钊同志取的。更少有人知道杀害大钊同志的绞架竟是军阀从帝国主义国家进口的。开端时一辆卡车驰来，奉系军阀张作霖命令打开车上的长箱，赫然一具阴森可怖的外国绞架。
    电视剧的结尾是大钊同志毫无惧色地迈步走向绞架。据当年《晨报》载：“首登绞刑台者为李大钊，闻李神色不变，”从容就义。刑前各方抢救，大钊同志的同乡白眉初等三百余人联名呈请释李的呈文中说：“李大钊茹苦食淡，冬一絮衣，夏一布衫，所受之辛苦，非笔墨所能形容者。”就义之后各报纷纷登载：“李大钊平昔不事储蓄，身后极为萧条”。李宅“空无家具，即有亦甚破烂”，“子女服饰朴实、可知其平日治家之俭约矣”。
    整部电视剧的风格亦如大钊同志朴实风骨，无哗众取宠之意，存“铁肩担道义，妙手著文章”（大钊曾写联）之宏愿。观之9集，集集精彩，正如一团烈火，可燃烧我辈之魂，并有学习李大钊同志为革命壮烈牺牲之豪情。
    看完全集，不得不佩服扮演李大钊同志的演员李雪健的表演艺术。一言一笑，一举一动，既具有燕赵多慷慨悲歌之情，又寓有为党为民战斗终身的赤子之心。雪健同志的表演艺术在国内应居前列，他无时无刻不生活在大钊同志的精神之中。我一边看，一边深深相信，屏幕上出现的是真正的李大钊。
    江泽民同志说：“李大钊不仅是渊博的学者，而且首先是杰出的战士。”“李大钊同志的光辉形象永远激励我们奋勇前进！”
    我真诚地希望我国人民、特别是青年朋友们都能看到这部9集连续剧《李大钊》。
