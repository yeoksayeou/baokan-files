Xinhua News Agency, Yamoussoukro, October 31st.

The small-scale summit on Angola peace concluded after three hours of discussions and closed late on the 30th.

The leaders who attended this summit included Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, President Miguel Trovoada of São Tomé and Príncipe, Gabonese President Omar Bongo, and Ivorian President Félix Houphouët-Boigny.

At a press conference held after the meeting, President Kaunda stated that the talks were very beneficial. The four leaders all emphasized that Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko should continue to serve as the mediator for the Angola peace talks.

The Angolan government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), which opposes the government, signed a ceasefire agreement in Badolite, Zaire, on June 22nd this year. However, due to mutual accusations of violating the ceasefire, the agreement has not been genuinely implemented.

Xinhua News Agency, Luanda, October 30th.

Of the 50,000 Cuban troops stationed in Angola, 25,190 have left Angola and returned to their home country by today, thus completing the first phase of the withdrawal.
