The Nepalese people have welcomed one distinguished guest after another from China with the greatest enthusiasm. This time, Premier Li Peng received the most cordial welcome in our country. This is because the Nepalese people know that the Chinese people are their close and reliable friends, and they harbor a special affection for China.

Although Nepal is a developing landlocked small country, China fully respects Nepal's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, does not interfere in Nepal's internal affairs in the slightest, and has always provided material and moral support when needed. Over the years, China has provided generous and selfless assistance in areas such as road transportation, hydroelectric irrigation, and industrial construction. To date, more than 20 major projects built with China's help are bringing economic benefits to Nepal. People affectionately refer to these as the "Chinese Road," "Chinese Bricks," "Chinese Cloth," and "Chinese Sugar," expressing their gratitude to the Chinese people.

The friendly relations between Nepal and China are a model built entirely on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and they have a particularly positive significance for peace and development in South Asia. Our friendship is not at the expense of any third country. As King Birendra of Nepal has said, "We harbor no ill will towards anyone, nor do we adopt policies that incite others to oppose each other for our own gain." Similarly, China has repeatedly expressed its willingness to maintain friendly relations with all countries in South Asia, including Nepal, and with all countries in the world on the basis of equality without harming the interests of others. There are no secrets in our bilateral relations, just like an open book for everyone to see.

This time, Premier Li Peng is visiting three South Asian countries, including Nepal, after China has quelled the unrest, making his visit particularly significant. As is known, in May and June of this year, under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and with the support of the broad masses of the people, the unrest caused by some domestic and foreign elements attempting to bring instability to China was suppressed. China continues to move forward resolutely in the cause of reform, opening up, and building socialist modernization. However, some foreign propaganda machines have spread all sorts of lies about this, and similar groundless rumors have also been heard in Nepal. It can be said that the Nepalese have been hearing erroneous propaganda against China since the 1950s, but this has not affected the strengthening and development of Sino-Nepalese friendship. Over the more than 35 years of exchanges between Nepal and China, the Nepalese people have seen everything clearly and will not be deceived. Premier Li Peng's visit this time has allowed more people to clearly see China's political stability and continuous economic development, its sincere desire to develop friendly and cooperative relations with neighboring countries, and its sincere efforts to contribute to world peace and development. Some countries in the world always want to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, using the difficulties caused by certain economic and social problems in developing countries to carry out subversive activities against them, or using their own economic and technological advantages to attempt to change the policies of other countries. Currently, China is suffering from this and is fighting tirelessly. This can be said to be an inspiration and a hope for all the weak and underdeveloped countries in the Third World.

History, geography, and culture have inseparably linked Nepal and China. Sino-Nepalese friendship is as ancient as history and as stable as the Himalayas. Premier Li Peng's visit this time has added a new chapter to Sino-Nepalese friendship, becoming an unforgettable and far-reaching event in the history of bilateral relations.

Long live Sino-Nepalese friendship!

　　令人高兴的友好访问
　　廓宾达·帕塔〔尼泊尔〕
    尼泊尔人民曾以最大的热情接待过一位又一位来自中国的贵宾，这次李鹏总理在我国受到最隆重的欢迎。因为尼泊尔人民都知道，中国人民是自己亲密、可靠的朋友，他们对中国怀有一种特殊的情感。
    尽管尼泊尔是一个发展中的内陆小国，但中国完全尊重尼泊尔的独立、主权和领土完整，丝毫不干涉尼泊尔的内政，并一直在其需要时给予物质、道义上的支持。多年来，中国在公路交通、水电灌溉及工业建设等方面提供了慷慨无私的援助，迄今在中国帮助下建成的20多个重大项目正在为尼泊尔带来经济效益。人们以“中国路”、“中国砖”、“中国布”、“中国糖”等亲切的称呼，表达对中国人民的感激之情。
    尼泊尔和中国之间的友好关系是完全建立在和平共处五项原则基础上的堪称典范的关系，对南亚和平与发展，它尤其有着积极的意义。我们的友谊不是出于损害任何第三国的考虑，正如尼泊尔国王比兰德拉所说，“我们不对任何人抱有不好的情感，也不采取挑起别人互相对立而从中渔利的政策。”同样，中国也多次表达了在不损害他人利益的平等基础上，同包括尼泊尔在内的南亚国家以及世界上所有国家保持友好关系的意愿。在我们两国的关系中不存在见不得人的秘密，就像打开在所有人面前的一本书。
    这次李鹏总理是在中国平息暴乱后对包括尼泊尔在内的三个南亚国家进行访问的，因而更有其特殊的重要性。众所周知，今年五六月间，在中国共产党强有力的领导下，在广大人民群众的支持下，妄图给中国带来动荡不安的一些国内外分子制造的暴乱被平息了，中国继续在改革开放、建设社会主义现代化的事业中坚定向前，但有些外国宣传机器却对此散布了种种谎言，在尼泊尔也听到了此类毫无根据的胡言乱语。可以说，我们尼泊尔人从五十年代开始就不断听到反对中国的错误宣传，然而这未能影响尼中两国友谊的加强和发展。尼泊尔人民在35年多来同中国的交往中一切都看得很清楚，他们不会被愚弄。李鹏总理这次访问，使更多的人清楚地看到中国政治稳定和经济持续发展，她愿同邻国发展友好合作关系的良好愿望，以及她为世界和平与发展尽力作贡献的一片热忱。世界上有的国家总想干涉别国的内政，利用发展中国家因某些经济、社会问题造成的困难对它们进行颠覆活动，或者凭借自己的经济、技术优势妄图改变别国的政策。目前中国正身受其害，在作不懈的斗争，这对第三世界所有不发达的弱国来说，可以说是鼓舞，是希望。
    历史、地理和文化把尼泊尔和中国不可分割地连在了一起，尼中友谊如历史一样悠久，像喜马拉雅山一样稳固。李鹏总理的这次访问为尼中友谊增添了新的篇章，成为两国关系史上具有深远影响的、令人难忘的大事。
    尼中友谊万岁！
