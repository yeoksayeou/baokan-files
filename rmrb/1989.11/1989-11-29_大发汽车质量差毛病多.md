	The quality of Dafeng cars is poor and they have many problems. This April, I took a newly purchased Dafeng minivan for its initial test drive and found that every part of the car had quality issues. First, the voltage regulator of the generator burned out, forcing me to spend a night outdoors. Then, the generator short-circuited and burned out, one of the engine cylinders stopped working, the side door wouldn't close properly, the rear trunk lid wouldn't stay shut, the universal joint support for the gear shift broke, the rocker arm inside the fuel pump broke, the fuel line from the fuel pump to the fuel tank ruptured and leaked oil, the coolant reservoir cracked, the brakes failed, the rear shock absorber made abnormal noises, the starter motor malfunctioned, the window crank on the front door was deformed, the wiring for the headlights was disconnected, and the fuel tank cap leaked oil.

	When I had no choice but to buy replacement parts, a salesperson at a store said, "These parts for Dafeng cars sell very quickly because they all need to be replaced!"

　　大发汽车质量差毛病多
    今年4月，我为一辆新购买的大发小旅行车跑初驶，发现车上每一部分都有质量问题：先是发电机调节器烧毁，在途中露宿半夜；继之，发电机短路烧毁、发动机一个汽缸不工作、侧车门关不严、后箱盖关不住、档杆万向轴支架断裂、汽油泵内摇臂断裂、汽油泵至油箱油管破裂漏油、防冻液储罐破裂、刹车不灵、后轮减震器有不正常怪音、起动马达有故障、前车门门窗玻璃摇臂变形、前大灯线路断路、油箱盖处漏油。
    当我不得不购买配件更换时，一商店售货员讲：“大发车的这些配件卖得特别快，因为这些配件都得换！”
