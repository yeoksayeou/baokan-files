Revolutionary holy land Yan'an City, surrounded by the rivers of Yanhe, Nanhe, and Xihe, with the mountains of Baota, Fenghuang, and Qingliang standing tall. In the morning, a red sun rises slowly from behind Baota Mountain. On the Yanhe Bridge and Baota Bridge, people and vehicles come and go, full of vitality.

I followed the crowd across the Yanhe Bridge and came to the foot of Qingliang Mountain. Walking up the steep dirt path for less than a hundred steps, I encountered a stone archway with a long couplet carved on both sides:

Two rivers encircle the morning view of Jia Ling Tower by the smoke,
Eight scenic spots surround the night view of Fenghuang Tower above.

It turns out that Qingliang Mountain is known as the "Golden Immortal Paradise," with caves, pavilions, and ancient sites scattered throughout. Following the stone steps upward, I passed by Yue'er Well, Wangyue Tower, Shifu Cave, and Fangong Temple. Halfway up the mountain, the "Yan'an Qingliang Mountain News and Publishing Revolutionary Memorial Hall" appeared.

The memorial hall exhibits over 400 photographs and more than 300 revolutionary relics, recreating the appearance of the news warriors of that time and taking people back to the fiery years of the Qingliang Mountain period.

Qingliang Mountain, known as the "News Mountain," is the birthplace of China's news and publishing industry. During the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, the Central Party Newspaper Committee, the Central Broadcasting Committee, the Central Publishing and Distribution Department, and various news agencies were all concentrated here. The pioneers of the news front created magnificent achievements here.

The first large-scale central party newspaper, *Liberation Daily*, was published here.

Xinhua News Agency was renamed here, and the first news dispatch under the name of Xinhua News Agency was sent from here. The first people's radio station, Yan'an Xinhua Radio Station, was established here.

A century of weakness sighs for China, eight years of war rely on Yan'an.
Who is the master of the nine provinces? All eyes are on Qingliang Mountain.

These lines, written by Comrade Chen Yi in Yan'an, are a tribute to Qingliang Mountain.

I seemed to see news warriors, each wearing an old military cap, dressed in gray uniforms, with their legs wrapped in puttees, full of spirit, bustling about. I seemed to hear the constant click-clack of the telegraph keys and the melodious singing.

Corn, black beans, pickled vegetables, and mountain yam cakes were the daily meals of the news warriors. Cave dwellings, old temples, and kang beds were their "comfortable nests." They had no holidays, no weekends, and no distinction between day and night. During the day, every second was precious. At night, in the yellow earth caves scattered on the mountain slopes and valleys, dim kerosene lamps lit up. Some were bent over their desks writing, some were shaking the handle of the telegraph key, and others were wearing headphones, quickly copying the telegraph code.

American commentator Atkinson, after visiting Qingliang Mountain, said on his departure: "I found that your youth are full of confidence and have lofty ideals, and this is the fundamental reason for your victory."

Comrade Mao Zedong once said in Yan'an: "The loyal bones are buried on Qingliang Mountain, why should one return home wrapped in horsehide?" The news warriors on Qingliang Mountain paid a precious youth for their news work. Some died young from overwork, while others sacrificed their lives in the battlefield, giving their lives for the country. In the shrubbery on the mountain slope, there is a grave where Yang Song, who once served as the editor-in-chief of *Liberation Daily*, rests in peace.

As I bid farewell to Yan'an, on the way to the airport, I couldn't help but look up at the majestic Qingliang Mountain, and then at the towering Baota and the flowing Yanhe River, silently wishing that the fine traditions of the "News Mountain" would be passed down from generation to generation!

### 清凉山

　　清凉山
　　伊心恬
    革命圣地延安城边，延河、南河、西河三河汇流，宝塔山、凤凰山、清凉山三山鼎立。清晨，一轮红日从宝塔山边冉冉升起，延河大桥、宝塔大桥上，人来车往，生机盎然。
    我随着人流走过延河大桥，来到清凉山麓，沿着陡坡土路，不到百步，迎面是一座石雕牌坊，两边刻着一副长联：
    二水绕座晨望嘉岭塔边烟
    八景环山夜对凤凰楼上目
    原来，清凉山号称“金仙胜境”，山上洞窟亭阁遍布，名胜古迹众多。沿石阶拾级而上，月儿井、望月楼、石佛洞、范公祠……掠身而过。到了半山腰，“延安清凉山新闻出版革命纪念馆”出现了。
    纪念馆中陈列的400多幅照片、300多件革命文物，再现了当年新闻战士的风貌，把人们带进了清凉山时期那如火如荼的年代。
    清凉山，人们叫做新闻山，是新中国新闻出版事业的发祥地。在抗日战争和解放战争时期，中央党报委员会、中央广播委员会、中央出版发行部和各新闻单位都集中在这里，新闻战线前辈们在这里开创了丰伟的业绩。
    我国第一张大型的党中央机关报《解放日报》在这里创刊。
    红中社在这里改名，第一次出现新华通讯社的名称，并以新华社名义在这里发出第一条电讯新闻。我国第一个人民广播电台延安新华广播电台在这里建立。
    百年积弱叹华夏，八载干戈仗延安。
    试问九州谁作主，万众瞩目清凉山。
    陈毅同志当年在延安留下的诗句，正是对清凉山的盛誉。
    我仿佛看到一个个头戴旧军帽、身穿灰军装、双腿缠绑腿的新闻战士，精神焕发，往来奔忙，耳边仿佛响起了那日夜不停的嘀哒嘀哒的电键声，那嘹亮的歌声。
    小米、黑豆、酸菜、山药蛋，是新闻战士们的家常饭菜，窑洞、旧庙、土炕，是他们的“安乐窝”。他们没有节假日，没有星期天，也不分日夜。白天，人们分秒必争。入夜，错落在山坡山坳的一孔孔黄土窑洞里，亮起了盏盏昏暗的煤油灯，有的伏桌笔耕，有的手摇马达，有的戴着耳机飞快地抄收电码。
    美国评论家艾金森到清凉山参观，临别时说：“我发现，你们青年都是有信心、有崇高理想的人，这就是你们取得胜利的根本。”
    毛泽东同志在延安时说过：“清凉山上埋忠骨，何必马革裹尸还。”清凉山上的新闻战士，为新闻工作付出了宝贵的青春，有的积劳成疾，英才早殇，有的牺牲在炮火中，以身殉国。在那山腰上的灌木丛中，有一穴墓地，曾任《解放日报》总编辑的杨松就长眠在这里。
    在告别延安的时候，在去机场的路上，我不由地抬头仰望那雄姿屹立的清凉山，再看一下巍峨的宝塔，潺潺的延河，默默地祝愿“新闻山”的优良传统代代相传！
