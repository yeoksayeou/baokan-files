On the afternoon of the 24th, the Third Committee of the 44th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (Social, Human Rights, and Cultural Committee) held a plenary meeting to vote on the draft resolution and amendment regarding "Freedom of Speech and Peaceful Assembly." However, before the vote, the Dutch representative, who drafted the resolution, announced the withdrawal of the draft. An anti-China plot ended in failure.

Originally, the rights to freedom of speech and peaceful assembly are important components of human rights and fundamental freedoms and should be affirmed. However, some individuals attempted to use this issue to engage in anti-China activities. In the draft resolution proposed by the Netherlands and 21 other countries, without naming China, they slandered China's recent suppression of counter-revolutionary riots as "suppressing peaceful assemblies," blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs. They also manipulated the language of the draft resolution, exaggerating the rights to freedom of speech and peaceful assembly, and deliberately ignoring the opinions of most member states on how to correctly exercise these two rights and the limitations they should be subject to.

China and 15 other countries expressed their views on this matter and, based on extensive consultations with many countries' representatives, proposed an amendment. The amendment requires that the resolution explicitly affirm the rights to freedom of speech and peaceful assembly at the beginning of its implementation section, without any ambiguity. The amendment also requires the resolution to include the statement that "no country should organize, support, plan, fund, or tolerate subversive, terrorist, and armed actions aimed at overthrowing the government of another country by force." The amendment agrees with the Dutch draft's statement that vigilance should be maintained against human rights violations anywhere, but believes this is not enough. It requires the addition of "prioritizing the resolution of large-scale, gross human rights violations" and condemning the Israeli authorities' use of force against non-violent peaceful demonstrations by Palestinian civilians in Israeli-occupied areas and South Africa's apartheid policy, which deprives the majority of South Africans of their dignity, basic freedoms, and human rights, including freedom of speech and peaceful assembly.

During external consultations and speeches at the meeting, many countries' representatives believed that the Dutch and other countries' draft resolution on freedom of speech and peaceful assembly was not comprehensive and balanced, while the amendment proposed by China and 15 other countries was more comprehensive in content, elucidating the true freedom of speech and peaceful assembly recognized by the international community.

According to the meeting rules, the amendment was voted on first. The Chinese representative, on behalf of China and co-sponsoring countries including Angola, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Cuba, Ghana, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Nepal, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Sri Lanka, introduced the content of the amendment. Zimbabwe also requested to join the co-sponsoring countries. The Iraqi representative proposed that the discussion on this issue could be concluded and requested the General Assembly to immediately vote on the amendment. When the chairman was about to have the countries' representatives vote on the Iraqi motion, the Dutch representative, seeing the situation was unfavorable, created a new issue, stating that what China and others proposed was not an amendment but a new draft resolution, requesting the chairman to first vote on his motion and temporarily not vote on the Iraqi motion, attempting to use procedural issues to dismiss the amendment proposed by China and others. The chairman agreed to the Dutch representative's request. At this point, there was some controversy in the meeting about the rules of procedure and how to vote on the Dutch representative's motion, causing some chaos in the meeting room. The Chinese representative stated that the rules of procedure do not clearly specify which motion should be voted on first, but for the meeting to proceed smoothly, the Chinese representative agreed with the chairman's decision to vote on the Dutch representative's motion first, only requesting that the chairman clarify what the affirmative and negative votes mean.

More than 100 countries' representatives immediately voted on the Dutch representative's motion. Only 30 votes were in favor of the Dutch motion, considering the amendment to be a new draft resolution, while 85 votes were against it. The Dutch motion was invalid. Next, the Iraqi representative's motion was to be voted on, and then the amendment proposed by China and others was to be voted on and passed, which meant formally rejecting the draft resolution of the Netherlands and others. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, the Dutch representative quickly announced the withdrawal of the draft resolution. The Chinese representative welcomed the Dutch representative's decision, stating that since the draft resolution no longer existed, the amendment was also unnecessary. At this point, the meeting room was filled with an atmosphere of excitement, with laughter and some light applause.

After the meeting, many countries' representatives shook hands with the Chinese representative, expressing congratulations, saying this was a victory for the majority of developing countries, thwarting the conspiracy of certain Western countries to interfere in the internal affairs of China and other developing countries under the pretext of human rights.

　　一次反华图谋的失败
　　——记联大三委关于人权提案的斗争
　　本报记者　刘开宸
    24日下午，第44届联大第三委员会（社会、人权和文化委员会）举行全体会议，就“言论及和平集会自由”提案和修正案进行表决。但在表决前，提案起草国荷兰代表宣布撤回了提案。一次反华图谋以失败而告终。
    本来，言论自由和和平集会的权利是人权与基本自由的重要内容，应加以肯定。但有人企图利用这个问题，进行反华活动。在荷兰等21国提出的决议草案中，不点名地污蔑中国不久前平息反革命暴乱是“镇压和平集会”，明目张胆地干涉中国内政。他们还在提案的文字上耍弄手法，片面夸大言论自由和和平集会两项权利，故意抹煞多数成员国对于如何正确行使这两项权利以及它应受到什么限制的意见。
    中国等15个国家对此表明了自己的看法，并在广泛征求许多国家代表意见的基础上，提出了一项修正案，要求在决议执行部分一开始就明确确认言论自由和和平集会权利，不得含糊其词。修正案还要求在决议中加上“任何国家不能组织、支持、策划、资助或容忍旨在以暴力推翻另一个国家政府的颠覆性的、恐怖主义的和武装的行动”。修正案同意荷兰草案中所说要对任何地方出现的侵犯人权的行为保持警惕，但认为这还不够，要求增加“优先解决大规模粗暴侵犯人权的行为”，并谴责以色列当局对以色列占领区巴勒斯坦平民的非暴力和平示威使用武力的行为和南非的种族隔离政策剥夺南非多数人民的尊严、基本自由与人权，包括言论自由和和平集会权利的行为。
    在会外磋商和会上发言时，许多国家代表认为荷兰等国提案关于言论自由和和平集会权利谈得不全面、不平衡，而中国等15国修正案在内容上更为全面，阐明了国际社会所认可的真正的言论自由和和平集会权利。
    按照会议规则，先就修正案进行表决。中国代表代表中国及安哥拉、巴林、孟加拉国、古巴、加纳、伊朗、伊拉克、约旦、科威特、利比亚、尼泊尔、巴基斯坦、沙特和斯里兰卡等共同提案国介绍了修正案的内容。津巴布韦也要求加入了提案国。伊拉克代表提出此问题的讨论可以结束，要求大会立即对修正案进行表决。当大会主席要各国代表就伊拉克的动议进行表决时，荷兰代表见势不妙，便节外生枝，说中国等提出的不是修正案，而是一个新提案，要求大会主席先就他的动议进行表决，暂不表决伊拉克的动议，企图以程序问题打掉中国等国提出的修正案。主席同意了荷兰代表的要求。这时，会上关于议事规则究竟如何有所争论，对如何表决荷兰代表的动议也不清楚，会场上有些混乱。中国代表表示，究竟应优先表决那一个动议，议事规则并无明确规定，但为了会议能顺利进行，中国代表同意主席决定的先表决荷兰代表的动议，只是请主席说清楚，投赞成票和反对票是什么含义。
    会上100多个国家的代表立即就荷兰代表的动议进行表决。赞成荷兰动议认为修正案是一个新提案的只有30票，而反对票的多达85票。荷兰动议无效。接下来要表决伊拉克代表动议，再接着就要表决和通过中国等国的修正案，也就是要正式否定荷兰等国的提案了。荷兰代表见大势已去，赶快宣布撤回提案。中国代表表示欢迎荷兰代表的决定，既然决议草案不存在了，修正案也就不必提了。这时，会场上一片兴奋气氛，有笑声，也有人轻轻鼓掌。
    会议结束后，许多国家代表同中国代表握手，表示祝贺，说这是广大发展中国家的一个胜利，挫败了某些西方国家借口人权干涉中国和其他发展中国家内政的阴谋。
