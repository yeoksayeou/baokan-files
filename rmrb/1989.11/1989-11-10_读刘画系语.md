Liu Senfu's ink painting exhibition has opened at the Nationalities Cultural Palace. This is the first exhibition by a painter from Taiwan since the Beijing unrest was quelled, and it is worthy of attention.

I have been acquainted with Mr. Liu Senfu, but it was only this summer that I had the opportunity to meet him at my home. Mr. Liu was born in Taiwan and is a very sincere person. Since we are in the same profession, we have a common language, so we became friends immediately.

Mr. Liu was born in 1933 in Taiwan. His ancestral home is in Tong'an County, Fujian. He has never been to the mainland, but he has always yearned for his ancestral home. In 1987 and 1988, the "Friends in the Air" column of the Central People's Broadcasting Station's Overseas Service received four screen paintings from a person in Taiwan who signed as "Descendant of Tong'an." The letter expressed endless longing for the motherland, which moved many people! This descendant of Tong'an is Mr. Liu. "Friends in the Air" wanted to comfort this son of Taiwan, and had my analysis and comments on Mr. Liu's paintings recorded and broadcast twice during the Lunar New Year, notifying him to listen. The warmth and care of the motherland gave him great encouragement and inspiration, making him determined to find a way to come to the mainland to visit his ancestors and prepare an exhibition in Beijing as a report and dedication to his motherland!

Mr. Liu's paintings, in his own words, have been guided by the "spirit of Shitao" and the "essence of Huang Binhong" for thirty years. In plain terms, this means adhering to the excellent traditional spirit and striving to explore further. This is his guiding principle. This is much wiser than those who do not strive to promote their own national traditions but instead look to others for crumbs!

From the works in this exhibition by Mr. Liu, it is clear that he has been tenaciously pursuing progress along the traditional path, techniques, forms of expression, and composition. He has a sense of diligence and restraint, without any intention of seeking popularity.

Since it is called "tradition," it has the task of development. If tradition does not develop, it cannot be passed down. The times are constantly advancing, and tradition cannot stop. Painting is a reflection of the times. Promoting tradition does not mean copying exactly and stagnating. Otherwise, it will be discarded by the times. This point must be highly valued by those who respect tradition and must not be taken lightly!

Mr. Liu's amateur creations are remarkable and worthy of praise. However, art has no boundaries, and only those who persist can make further progress. I say these words to encourage fellow artists on both sides of the Taiwan Strait!

    读刘画系语

    刘森福的水墨画展，在民族文化宫开幕了，这是北京平息暴乱后，第一位由台来京展览的画家，值得瞩目。
    我与刘森福先生，属于神交，直至今年夏天，才有机会在我家见了面。刘先生出生在台湾，人很忠厚。又因为是同行，有共同语言，所以能一见如故。
    刘先生1933年出生在台湾。他的祖籍在福建同安县。他一直没来过大陆，却一直怀念着他的梓里。1987和1988两年，中央广播电台台播部“空中之友”专栏，先后两次收到台湾一位署名“同安后裔”的国画四条屏。信中有说不尽的思念祖国之情，使人感动！这位同安后裔，就是刘先生。“空中之友”为了慰藉这位台岛赤子，曾先后两次将刘先生的画幅，请我析解和评说，录音后在两次农历除夕向台湾播放，并事先通知他注意收听。祖国的热情与关怀，给他以极大的激励与鼓舞，使他产生了千方百计要来大陆探亲拜祖的念头，并决计筹备一个画展，到北京展出，作为向祖国母亲的汇报与奉献赤诚的心！
    刘先生的绘画，用他自己的话说，三十年来，一贯崇尚“石涛精神”、“白石为本”。直白的说，就是本着优秀的传统精神，努力向前探索。这是他的主导思想。这比一些人不努力弘扬本民族的传统，而去仰人鼻息，吃人家的残羹剩汤高明多了！
    从这次刘先生的画展作品，清楚地看出了刘先生沿着传统的轨道、手法、表现形式、构图，在顽强的求进。有兢兢矜持之心，无哗众取宠之意。
    既然叫“传统”，它就有一个发展的任务。传统若不发展，它就“传”不下去。时代是不断前进的，传统欲停止也是不可能的。绘画是时代的反映。不能认为发扬传统就是照抄不误，固步自封。否则，就会被时代所抛弃。这一点一定要引起我们尊重传统者的高度重视，千万不能等闲视之！
    刘先生业余创作，成绩可观，值得称赞。然艺无止境，有“锲而不舍”精神者，方能百尺竿头再进一步。说了这些，用以与海峡两岸同好者共勉！
