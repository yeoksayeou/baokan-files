Shanghai's Chongming County has seen a surge in the development of specialized villages, with over 100 such villages showing significant vitality. The labor productivity in these specialized villages is markedly higher than in non-specialized villages. Last year, 29 specialized villages in agricultural production saw their per capita income increase by an average of seven times compared to ordinary households. The county committee believes that the rise of specialized villages is a crucial step in deepening rural reforms and enhancing the operational level of the household contract responsibility system.

Chongming County began promoting specialized villages in 1987, leveraging local advantages to develop these villages. The criteria for a specialized village include: a single specialty's output accounting for more than 50% of the village's total output, households engaged in the specialty making up more than 30% of the total households, and a commodity production rate of over 90%. Currently, the 100 specialized villages primarily focus on planting and breeding industries, including grains, medicinal herbs, sugarcane, sweet corn, peppermint, poultry, mink, and freshwater fish. According to a survey of 42 specialized villages, the commodity rate reached 98%, with many products being exported. The average annual income from specialized production in these villages is approximately 20 million yuan, several times higher than in non-specialized villages. The per-acre output value is also more than 50% higher than in non-specialized villages. Specialized households in livestock breeding transfer their land to large-scale farmers, concentrating land in the hands of skilled farmers and improving the scale efficiency of grain production.

The development of specialized villages has led household operations towards specialization and socialization, facilitating the use of agricultural machinery, the promotion of advanced technologies, and the conservation of labor, thereby overcoming the disadvantages of "small and complete" operations and improving operational levels.

Farmers in specialized villages are beginning to address short-term production behaviors. Last year, investment by these farmers increased by 15% compared to the previous year, and this year's growth is expected to be even greater.

    提高家庭承包制经营水平
    崇明百余专业村显活力
    劳动生产率大大高于非专业村
    本报上海11月8日电　记者章世鸿、刘士安报道：上海市崇明县的专业村建设出现生机，已建立的100多个专业村劳动生产率普遍提高。去年，有29个种植业专业村专业户的收入，比面上一般农户平均高7倍左右。县委认为：专业村的兴起，是深化农村改革、提高家庭承包责任制经营水平的重要步骤。
    崇明县从1987年开始因势利导，大力发展专业村。专业村的标准是，某一专业的产值占全村总产值50％以上，经营的农户数占全村总户30％以上，商品生产率达90％以上。目前，100个专业村主要经营种植业和养殖业，有粮食、药材、甘蔗、甜玉米、薄荷、肉类鸡、水貂、淡水鱼等。据对42个专业村调查，商品率达98％，不少是出口产品。各村专业生产收入平均约2000万元，比分散经营的非专业村高数倍，每亩地产值也比非专业村高50％以上。养殖业专业户将土地转让给种田大户，使土地向种田能手集中，提高了粮食生产规模效益。
    专业村的建设，使家庭经营走上专业化、社会化的道路，有利于采用农业机械，推广先进技术，节约劳动力，从而克服“小而全”的缺点，提高经营水平。
    专业村农户开始克服生产上的短期行为。去年，这部分农民的投资比前年增长15％，今年增长将更多。
