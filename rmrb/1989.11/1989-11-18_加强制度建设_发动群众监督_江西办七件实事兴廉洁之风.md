Jiangxi province has made significant progress in its anti-corruption efforts by focusing on seven key areas.

    — The province has implemented a system of "two publicizations and one supervision" for the circulation of agricultural production materials, effectively stopping the practice of obtaining fertilizers and pesticides through backdoor deals. According to a survey, in 1988, the provincial agricultural materials company had 10,557 tons of urea allocated at planned and mid-level prices by leaders at the provincial, bureau, and company levels. This year, no leaders issued any directives, and all planned agricultural materials were supplied to farmers on time. During the spring and summer of this year, Jiangxi province experienced severe floods, but due to the high morale of the farmers, the pace and quantity of summer grain storage were among the fastest and largest in recent years.

    — The practice of using public funds for banquets has been curbed, with entertainment expenses in various levels of party and government agencies reduced by 60-90%.

    — Efforts have been made to clean up and rectify the construction of private houses by party and government officials in urban areas. According to a survey, since February 1986, 19 provincial and bureau-level officials and 538 county and department-level officials have built private houses in urban areas, which has drawn significant public criticism. Since April this year, Jiangxi province has organized 10,000 officials to participate in the house-cleaning work and has clearly stipulated the handling regulations. By the end of October, those who built houses in violation of regulations had voluntarily refunded 24.7 million yuan and returned 32,000 square meters of land.

    — The purchase of imported luxury cars has been strictly prohibited, and the management of small cars has been tightened. According to a survey, the number of small cars in the province is 3.8 times that of 1982, with a particularly sharp increase in high-end sedans. Since 1982, an average of 36 cars have been added each year. Problems such as excess vehicles, misuse, private use, waste, and using cars for personal gain are serious, placing a heavy burden on local finances and drawing strong public criticism. This year, the provincial party committee and government have issued regulations to handle a batch of luxury cars and to manage the existing small cars in the province.

    — Major cases of corruption have been investigated and punished. Since this year, the provincial discipline inspection, supervision, and procuratorial systems have handled a total of 1,863 cases of violations of discipline and law, with 184 people expelled from the party, 178 people receiving a party probationary punishment, 369 people receiving demotions or other party disciplinary actions, 69 people receiving criminal penalties, and 126 people receiving administrative penalties.

    — Companies have been cleaned up and rectified. 235 out of 255 officials working in companies or holding concurrent positions in provincial agencies have been disengaged, 1,043 companies (centers) have been merged or dissolved, more than 170 business licenses of illegal companies have been revoked, and more than 300 cases of violations and illegal activities have been investigated and handled.

    — Public funds embezzled and occupied by officials and staff have been recovered. The province has identified 144,000 officials and staff who have embezzled or occupied public funds totaling 90.3 million yuan, with most places having recovered more than 90%.

The success of Jiangxi's anti-corruption efforts lies in publicizing regulations and investigation results, and mobilizing the masses to supervise. Once a violator is found, swift action is taken to investigate and punish, ensuring that orders are carried out and violators are held accountable. This prevents the recurrence of past practices where actions were merely threatened but not followed through.

    加强制度建设　发动群众监督
    江西办七件实事兴廉洁之风
    本报南昌11月17日电　记者赵相如报道：江西省从办7件实事入手抓廉政建设，取得较好的成效。
    ——对农业生产资料流通环节实行“两公开一监督”，坚决刹住开后门购化肥、农药的歪风。据调查，去年省农资公司由省、厅、公司三级领导批供的平价、中价尿素达10557吨，今年没有一个领导人批条子，全省计划供应的农用物资如数及时供应到农民手中。今年春夏之间，江西省遭严重水灾，由于农民积极性高涨，夏粮入库进度之快、数量之多，是近几年少有的。
    ——刹住了公款吃喝风，各级党政机关的招待费用普遍下降60—90％。
    ——大力清理整顿党政机关干部在城镇违纪建私房。据调查，从1986年2月以来全省共有地厅级干部19人、县处级干部538人，在城镇建了私房，群众意见较大。今年4月以来，江西省组织万名干部参加清房工作，并明确作了处理规定。到10月底，违纪建房者已主动退赔247万元，退出房基地3.2万平方米。
    ——严禁购买进口豪华车，严格小汽车的管理。经清查，全省现有小汽车是1982年的3.8倍，尤其是高级小轿车增加更猛，1982年以来平均每年增加36辆，车辆超编、滥用、私用、浪费、以车谋私现象严重，地方财政负担沉重，群众反映强烈。今年省委、省政府作出规定，对一批豪华车作退货处理，对全省现有小车管理作出若干规定。
    ——查处大案要案，坚决惩治腐败。今年以来，全省纪检、监察和检察系统共受理、查处各类违纪、违法案件1863件，有184人被开除党籍，178人受留党察看处分，受撤销党内职务等处分的369人，受刑事处分的69人，受行政处分的126人。
    ——清理整顿公司。省直机关在公司任职、兼职的255名干部已有235名脱钩，撤并公司（中心）1043户，吊销170多户违法经营公司的营业执照，查处了违章、违法案件300多起。
    ——清收干部职工拖欠和侵占的公款。全省共清出144万名干部职工拖欠和侵占公款9030万元，目前多数地方已收回90％以上。
    江西省廉政建设之所以成效显著，关键是把规章制度和查处结果公之于众，发动群众监督。一旦发现胆敢违纪者就迅速查处，做到令出必行，违者必究，决不让过去那种“光打雷不下雨”、“下不为例”的做法重演。
