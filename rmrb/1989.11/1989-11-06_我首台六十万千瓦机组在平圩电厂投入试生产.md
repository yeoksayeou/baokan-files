The first 600,000 kW unit in China, which is the largest single-unit capacity in the country, has begun trial operation at the Huainan Pingzui Power Plant. The unit, which was completed on November 4 at 4 PM, uses technology imported from the United States and was manufactured in China. This unit employs electronic computer monitoring and has reached the advanced level of the world in the early 1980s. After half a year of trial operation and improvements, the unit will be standardized for mass production and will become the mainstay unit for China in the 1990s.
