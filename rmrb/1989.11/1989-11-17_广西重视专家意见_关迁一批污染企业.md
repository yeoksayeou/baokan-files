Guangxi values expert opinions and shuts down a batch of polluting enterprises. Our reporter Jiang Yaojiang reports from Nanning: Guangxi values the suggestions of experts and scholars, seriously addressing environmental pollution. Recently, several enterprises have been given red and yellow cards: four enterprises in Hechi, including the Lashantun Arsenic Factory, have been ordered to stop production due to severe pollution and inability to rectify it. Several other enterprises have been given a deadline to rectify pollution or relocate out of the city.

In recent years, some cities in Guangxi have experienced severe air pollution, with noise levels universally exceeding standards, and a large volume of industrial solid waste with low treatment rates. Agricultural environmental pollution is also on the rise.

The relevant departments of the Autonomous Region have valued the suggestions of experts and scholars, correcting the practice of some enterprises that only focus on economic indicators and ignore environmental pollution. They have also, in conjunction with rectification and reorganization, shut down, stopped, merged, and transformed a batch of small arsenic factories, small paper mills, small smelting plants, small chemical plants, small electroplating plants, small tanneries, and small refineries that cause severe pollution. For those private mining points that indiscriminately exploit and destroy resources, they have been resolutely shut down.

    广西重视专家意见  关迁一批污染企业
    本报南宁11月16日电　记者蒋耀强报道：广西重视专家学者建议，认真治理环境污染，日前对一批企业分别亮出了红牌、黄牌：河池地区拉新屯砒霜厂等4家企业环境污染严重而无力治理，被责令停止生产。另有几家企业被限期治理污染或迁出市区。
    近几年来，广西一些城市大气污染比较严重，噪音普遍超标准，工业固体废气物量大处理率低，农业环境污染也在发展。
    自治区有关部门重视专家学者的建议，纠正了少部分企业只顾经济指标不管环境污染的做法，并结合治理整顿，关、停、并、转了一批污染严重的小砒霜厂、小造纸厂、小冶炼厂、小化工厂、小电镀厂、小制革厂、小炼油厂等。对那些毁灭性滥采乱挖，破坏资源的民办矿点坚决予以取缔。
