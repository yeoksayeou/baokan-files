In the autumn, I visited Nanchang, Jiangxi Province. At the confluence of the Ganjiang and Fu River, a newly built pavilion stands prominently. This is the Tengwang Pavilion, which was praised by Han Yu as "magnificent and unique" and is considered one of the three most famous pavilions in the south. The reconstruction of this famous pavilion, which began in 1985, officially opened to visitors on this year's Chongyang Festival.

The reconstructed Tengwang Pavilion is located at the intersection of Chuanjiang Avenue and Diecun Road in Nanchang. The new site is part of the Fu River's old riverbed, where a dam was built and the river was filled in. This location is adjacent to the city and overlooks the river, facing the August 1st Bridge to the north and about 100 meters away from the old site of the Tang Dynasty Tengwang Pavilion to the east, and 300 meters away from the old site of the Qing Dynasty pavilion to the south. The reconstructed Tengwang Pavilion is 54.5 meters high, with nine levels. Its base is a 12.6-meter-high platform symbolizing the ancient city wall, with an exhibition hall inside. The entire pavilion's framework is made of reinforced concrete imitating wooden structures, and its architectural style is modeled after the Song Dynasty.

From the outside, it is a typical example of national architectural style, while the interior structure is modernized. Inside the pavilion, there are two elevators for visitors to use, and of course, visitors can also climb the stairs. The pavilion is also equipped with modern lighting, water supply, ventilation, fire protection, and sanitation facilities. However, its furnishings and layout are full of national characteristics and local flavor, making the entire building appear magnificent, exquisite, elegant, and dignified. As the saying goes, "The pavilion soars high with green tiles, rising above the clouds; the flying pavilion is adorned with red and green beams and columns, overlooking the ground."

This pavilion is based on the sketch drawn by the famous architect Liang Sicheng in 1942, referring to the Song Dynasty painting "Tengwang Pavilion" stored in the "Tianlai Pavilion" and the Song Dynasty book "Yingzao Fashi," and is redesigned as a large-scale Song-style ancient building, expressing the scenery described in Wang Bo's "Tengwang Pavilion Preface."

Why is it called Tengwang Pavilion? Because the pavilion was first built in the fourth year of Yonghui during the Tang Dynasty, which is 653 AD. The pavilion was built by Li Yuan, the younger brother of Emperor Taizong of Tang, when he was the governor of Hongzhou (Nanchang). Before that, in the 13th year of Zhenguan, Emperor Taizong of Tang bestowed the title of Prince Teng to his brother Yuan. After the pavilion was completed, it was named after his title. Over the past thousand years, the pavilion has been destroyed and rebuilt 28 times (or 27 times according to another account). The Tengwang Pavilion rebuilt during the late Qing Dynasty was destroyed in the war in 1926. This is the first reconstruction in the 20th century.

When talking about Tengwang Pavilion, one naturally thinks of the famous "Tengwang Pavilion Preface" by Wang Bo, which has been widely circulated for a thousand years.

It was in the second year of the Shangyuan period of the Tang Dynasty (675 AD) during the Chongyang Festival. At that time, Yan Bishi, the governor of Hongzhou, rebuilt the pavilion. It is said that Yan's son-in-law was quite talented in writing, and Yan ordered him to write an article to commemorate the reconstruction of the pavilion, intending to show off his talent at the banquet. On the Chongyang Festival, Yan held a grand banquet at Tengwang Pavilion, inviting many distinguished guests. Coincidentally, Wang Bo was on his way to visit his parents in Jiaozhi and passed through Hongzhou. As an unexpected guest, he was seated and drank wine. After drinking, Yan, the governor, asked all the guests to write a preface for the pavilion. Everyone declined, but Wang Bo, being young and ambitious, readily agreed. Yan was very displeased and left in a huff. Wang Bo, however, was not bothered and wrote in front of everyone: "Nanchang is an ancient prefecture, and Hongdu is a new prefecture." Yan read it and said, "It's just old clichés, what everyone says." Then, Wang Bo wrote: "The stars are divided into wings and axes, and the land connects Heng and Lu." Yan began to ponder in silence. Until Wang Bo wrote the lines: "The setting sun and the lone wild geese fly together, and the autumn water blends with the long sky in one color," Yan was greatly surprised and exclaimed, "Genius, truly a genius!" Wang Bo finished his writing, and everyone was amazed. Yan said, "This article can be passed down for a thousand years." His words proved to be true.

This time, the inscription reads: "See the long rainbow flying, and a hundred boats vying for the current, emerging with the new posture of 'the setting sun and the lone wild geese flying together'; enjoy the singing of orioles and the dancing of swallows, and the spring breeze of willows, implying the profound meaning of 'the autumn water blending with the long sky in one color.' Rising above the clouds and overlooking the ground, it is indeed not just flattery; opening the door and looking far, the clouds rise and the mist disperses, imagining the prosperity of the middle kingdom. Looking back at the past and the present, one feels the heroic spirit of continuing the past and opening up the future. The reform tide surges in the chest, gazing into the future, the river and sky stretch for ten thousand miles."

I think that such a description of a peaceful and prosperous world is both beautiful and appropriate.

    记重建滕王阁
    鲁庸
    金秋季节，我来到江西南昌市，在赣江和抚河的交汇处，有一座新建的楼阁突兀而起，这就是被韩愈称之谓“瑰伟绝特”、居以江南三大名楼之冠的滕王阁。这座从1985年开始重修的名楼，已在今年的重阳节正式接待游人。
    重建的滕王阁坐落在南昌市沿江大道叠山路口，新阁址是结合抚河故道堵口水利工程，筑坝填江而成。此地背城临江，与北面的八一大桥遥遥相对，距东侧的唐朝滕王阁旧址约百余米，离南端的清代旧阁址有300米。重建的滕王阁高54.5米，上下共九层，它的底座是12.6米高的象征古城墙的台座，台座内部辟为陈列室。整个阁楼的骨架采用钢筋混凝土仿木结构，建筑形式为宋代格局。
    从外表看是典型的民族建筑色彩，而内部结构却是现代化的。阁内设有两架电梯，可供游人乘坐，当然也可以步行登楼，阁内还有现代化的照明、供水、通风、消防、卫生等设施，但其陈设布置却是一派民族特色和乡土情趣，整个建筑显得雄伟、瑰丽、典雅、端庄。正所谓“层台耸翠，碧色琉璃瓦顶，上出重霄；飞阁流丹，丹青斗拱梁柱，下临无地。”
    此阁是根据古建筑大师梁思成1942年所绘草图，参照“天籁阁”所藏宋画《滕王阁》，以及宋代《营造法式》一书重新设计的一座大型宋式古建筑，表现了唐代王勃《滕王阁序》的意境。
    为什么称它为滕王阁呢？因为此阁最早创见于唐朝永徽四年，即公元653年。阁是唐太宗李世民之弟李元婴为洪州（南昌）都督时所建。在这以前，贞观13年，唐太宗封其弟元婴为滕王，此阁建成后，就用他的封号命名。一千多年来，此阁毁而重建者凡28次（一说27次），清末重建的滕王阁于1926年毁于战争，这次是20世纪第一次重建。
    说到滕王阁，自然使人想到千百年来脍炙人口的王勃《滕王阁序》。
    那是唐代上元二年（公元675年）重阳节的事，当时洪州都督阎伯屿重修此阁，据传，阎公之婿颇有文采，阎公为此阁之重修令其撰文以志盛，欲在宴会上夸耀其文采。重阳节那天，阎公在滕王阁内大宴宾客，群贤毕集，适逢王勃赴交趾省亲，途经洪州，作为不速之客，入座饮酒。酒酣，阎都督遍请众宾客为阁写序，众皆谦辞，唯王勃年少气盛，欣然应诺。阎公甚为不悦，拂袖而起。王勃并不在意，当众挥毫：“南昌故郡，洪都新府。”阎公看了说：“不过是老生常谈，人云亦云。”接着，王勃又写道：“星分翼轸，地接衡庐。”阎公开始沉吟不语，直到王勃写出：“落霞与孤鹜齐飞，秋水共长天一色”两句，阎公大为惊骇，不禁拍案叫绝：“天才，真是天才！”王勃文成，举座皆惊，阎公断言：“此文可永传千古。”这句话还真让他说对了。
    这回重建的碑记中有云：“看长虹飞架，百舸争流，出落霞与孤鹜齐飞新姿；喜莺歌燕舞，杨柳春风，寓秋水共长天一色深意。上出重霄，下临无地，洵非王郎之谀辞；排闼放目，云蒸霞蔚，想见中兴之气象。抚今追昔，兴继往开来之豪情。改革大潮，奔突胸臆，瞻望前途，江天万里。”
    我以为，这样记颂太平盛世，既优美而又确当。
