This year, since February, Hebei Province's Baoding region has expanded the labor contract certification pilot program from state-owned and collective enterprises to private enterprises and individual business households. By late October, 1078 private enterprises and individual business households, employing 10,876 workers, have had their labor contracts certified.

Through labor contract certification, legal supervision has been implemented on the hiring activities of private enterprises, curbing the arbitrary hiring and firing practices of private business owners and the tendency of workers to leave at will. This has changed the situation where private enterprises rely solely on "gentlemen's agreements" for hiring, leading to difficulties in resolving labor disputes and settling cases. It provides a policy basis and legal guarantee for resolving labor disputes in private enterprises, protecting the legal rights of both parties in the contract. In Shě County, a private wool mill with 300 workers went on strike due to a dispute with the management. County arbitration officials, based on the certified labor contracts between the business owner and the workers, proposed a resolution that was acceptable to the workers, and the business owner was also satisfied, allowing the mill to resume operations quickly.

Through the certification of labor contracts, the use of child labor has been effectively curbed. According to incomplete statistics, as of now, over 200 child workers have been dismissed from private enterprises that have certified labor contracts in the entire region.

    对私营企业雇工实施法律监督
    保定地区鉴证万余份劳动合同
    本报讯　今年2月以来，河北省保定地区将劳动合同鉴证试点工作，从国营和集体企业推广到私营企业和个体工商户，到10月下旬，已鉴证私营企业和个体工商户1078户，雇工10876人的劳动合同。
    通过劳动合同鉴证，对私营企业雇工活动实行法律监督，制约了私营业主在用工上想辞就辞和雇工不想干就走的随意性。改变了私营企业用工单凭“君子协议”，一旦发生劳动争议，处理无标准，官司难断清的状况，为解决私营企业中的劳动争议提供了政策依据和法律保障，维护了私营企业合同双方的合法权益。蠡县一家私营毛纺厂的300名雇工，因故与厂方发生争议，罢工停产。县仲裁干部依据业主和雇工所鉴证的劳动合同，拿出了处理意见，取得了雇工的谅解，业主也很满意，使该厂很快复工。
    通过鉴证劳动合同，还有效地刹住了使用童工的违法行为。据不完全统计，到目前在全区鉴证劳动合同的私营企业中已清退童工200余名。
