	The Value of Dedication
	Li Hua

	After reading the article "This Heart Will Forever Be in Old Border Ridge" published on the front page of the People's Daily on October 16, I was deeply moved. The author, Comrade Huang Zili (a national labor model), works as a track maintenance worker in the Old Border Ridge section of the main peak of the Funiu Mountains in Henan. For 30 kilometers up and down, there are no people, no electricity, no radio, only a transistor radio brings some joy. Yet, Old Huang has been working there for 27 years. He thinks: "Now we are the masters of the country. No matter how hard or tired we are, we are working for the country, which is also for ourselves, so we always feel happy in our hearts." What kind of spirit is this? It is the spirit of silent dedication of a Communist.

	It is said that the "spirit of dedication" is not so popular or fashionable in the minds of some people nowadays. "Now we talk about economic benefits, how much is the spirit of dedication worth?" Huang Zili's deeds are a powerful refutation of such arguments. It shows that true Communists have not changed their original intentions, and the spirit of dedication should still be the main theme of our era.

	We have criticized "empty politics" and the "omnipotence of spirit," which is correct. We emphasize the principle of material interests and implement distribution according to work in our reform and opening up, which is also correct. However, if we think that we can therefore ignore the positive role of the spirit, that would be wrong. In fact, due to this misunderstanding, for a period of time, "everything for money" seemed very fashionable, and some people grabbed money without scruples, ruining the social atmosphere.

	Communist Party members, of course, also have material interests, but Communist Party members should more emphasize dedication, dedicating to the Party, the country, and the people. Only in this way can we be in line with the purpose of the Communist Party. Huang Zili is such a comrade. I wish more Communist Party members could be like Huang Zili, inspiring people with their noble spirit and giving people the strength to strive forward.

    奉献的可贵
    李华
    读10月16日人民日报一版的国庆征文“此心永在老界岭”一文，感叹不已。作者黄自立同志（全国劳动模范）在河南伏牛山主峰老界岭道班当养路工，那里上下几十公里没人烟，没有电，没有广播，只有一台半导体收音机带来点乐趣。可是老黄一干就是27年。他想的是：“如今咱是国家主人，再苦再累是为国家干，也是为自己干，因此心里总是乐滋滋的。”这是什么精神？是共产党人默默奉献的精神。
    据说，“奉献精神”如今在某些人的心目中不那么行时、吃香了。“现在讲经济实惠，奉献精神值几个钱？”黄自立的事迹，就是对这种论调的有力批驳，它表明：真正的共产党人未改初衷，奉献精神仍应是我们这个时代的主旋律。
    我们曾批判过“空头政治”、“精神万能”论，这是对的。我们在改革开放中强调物质利益原则和实行按劳分配，这是对的。但是，如果以为因此就可以忽视人的精神的积极作用，那就错了。事实上，由于这一误解，一个时期以来，“一切向钱看”似乎很吃香，有些人抓起钱来更是不择手段，搞坏了社会风气。
    我们共产党人当然也有物质利益的追求，但是共产党人更应当讲奉献，为党为国为人民奉献。只有这样，才符合共产党的宗旨。黄自立就是这样的同志。愿更多的共产党员，能像黄自立那样，以自己高尚的精神，给人们带来奋发向上的力量。
