Pre-Tournament Observations of the Women's Volleyball World Cup

The Sunday Before the Big Match

November 5th was the Sunday before the big match. Excluding the team from East Germany, the seven teams that had arrived in Tokyo were arranged by the organizing committee to practice for one hour each in the official venue for this tournament—the First Gymnasium of the National Yoyogi Sports Center. This gymnasium is originally a swimming pool, and the indoor environment is quite cold, filled with the smell of bleach.

At 10 AM, the Chinese women's volleyball team arrived at the venue for practice. Head coach Hu Jin was serious and focused, and the players were full of energy, meticulous in their actions. Vice Director Chen Zhaodi said that this practice was mainly to familiarize themselves with the venue and adapt to the environment. In the afternoon, the Chinese women's volleyball team went to a sports gymnasium far from Tokyo for a two-hour practice. On this Sunday before the big match, the athletes spent their time in two rounds of sweaty practice.

Fans of the Chinese Women's Volleyball Team

Yesterday, at the airport welcoming the Chinese women's volleyball team, there was also a Japanese man named Maeda, who asked Hu Jin many questions. In the evening, Mr. Maeda came to the hotel and gave the volleyball players apples, oranges, and chocolates. This morning, he came to the gymnasium to watch the Chinese women's volleyball team practice.

Mr. Maeda said that during the last Women's Volleyball World Cup, he made banners and cheered for the Chinese women's volleyball team with Chinese students. A reporter from a Japanese volleyball magazine interviewed him and asked if one of his parents was Chinese and why he liked the Chinese women's volleyball team so much. Mr. Maeda laughed and replied, "Both of my parents are Japanese. I am just a fan of the Chinese women's volleyball team." He was proud to have a volleyball signed by the entire Chinese women's volleyball team and a photo of himself wearing the gold medal won by the Chinese women's volleyball team.

The Japanese Team with the Advantage of Time and Place

Today, the Japanese team appeared on the practice court, and everyone saw the figure of Hiroki Eda again. After the Seoul Olympics, she announced her retirement and went to study at Tsukuba University. To strengthen the team, the Japanese Volleyball Association called her back to the team. The 1.83-meter-tall Hiroki Eda rejoined the team, adding another experienced main attacker for the Japanese team.

### 世界杯女排赛赛前见闻

    世界杯女排赛赛前见闻
    大赛前的星期天
    5日是大赛前的星期天。除民主德国队外，抵达东京的7支女队，由组委会安排在本次比赛的正式场地——国立代代木运动场第一体育馆内各练1小时。该体育馆本是游泳馆，室内较为阴冷，充满漂白粉的味道。
    上午10点，中国女排来到场地进行训练。主教练胡进严肃认真，队员们生气勃勃，一丝不苟。陈招娣副团长说，这次训练主要是为熟悉场地、适应环境。下午，中国女排又来到远离东京的一个企业的体育馆，训练了两个小时。大赛前的这个星期天，运动员们是在两身汗水中渡过的。
    中国女排的球迷
    昨天在机场迎接中国女排的，还有一位叫前田的日本人，见到胡进就问长问短。晚上，前田先生来到饭店，把苹果、桔子和巧克力送给女排队员们。今天上午他又来体育馆看中国女排训练。
    前田先生说，上届世界杯女排赛，他制作了横幅标语，和中国留学生一起为中国女排加油。日本一家排球杂志的记者采访他时，问他父母是否有一方是中国人，为什么这样喜欢中国女排。前田先生笑答：“父母都是日本人。我就是中国女排的球迷。”他为自己有一个中国女排全体队员签名的排球和一张自己身挂中国女排夺得的金牌的照片而感到自豪。
    占天时地利的日本队
    今天在练习场上出现的日本队，人们又看到了广纪江的身影。汉城奥运会后，她宣布引退，去筑波大学读书。为增强实力，日本排协又召她归队。1.83米的广纪江重新入队，为日本队又添了一名久经沙场的主攻手。
