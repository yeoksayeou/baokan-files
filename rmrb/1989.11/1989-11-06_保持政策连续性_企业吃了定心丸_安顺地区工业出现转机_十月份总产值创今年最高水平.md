The Anshun Regional Committee and Administrative Office of Guizhou Province have focused on maintaining the stability and continuity of current policies to alleviate the concerns of enterprise managers and workers. This approach has led to a turnaround in the region's industrial production, which had previously declined. In October, the total industrial output value reached the highest level of the year.

In the first three quarters of this year, the cumulative industrial output value in the Anshun Region was only 64.5% of the annual plan. Facing this severe situation, the leaders of the Regional Committee and Administrative Office conducted in-depth investigations in enterprises and discovered that while factors such as tight funds, raw materials, energy, and transportation had contributed to the decline in production, the doubts among enterprise managers and workers about the factory director responsibility system, enterprise contracting system, and specific management policies had significantly affected their ability to concentrate on organizing and directing production.

To address this, soon after the National Day celebrations, the Regional Committee and Administrative Office convened an emergency meeting on industrial production for the entire region. They clearly announced that the guiding ideology of focusing on economic construction would not change; the stability of the enterprise contracting system would not change; the factory director responsibility system would not change; and that the roles of the factory director and the party secretary were different but their responsibilities were the same, emphasizing the need for them to work together to improve enterprise production.

The stabilization of policies has given enterprises a sense of security. Many factory directors expressed that with the leadership understanding and considering the difficulties faced by enterprises, they could now focus on production and management with confidence. Many enterprises launched the "Double Increase, Double Decrease" campaign to ensure the completion of this year's production tasks. The regional leaders also organized several working groups with relevant departments to go to the 11 counties and cities in the region for on-site offices, helping to solve problems on the ground.

In just one month, the production of enterprises in the Anshun Region showed signs of recovery. In October, the light industry sector's output value increased by 25% compared to September.

    保持政策连续性  企业吃了定心丸
    安顺地区工业出现转机
    十月份总产值创今年最高水平
    本报贵阳11月5日电　记者潘帝都、胡跃平报道：贵州省安顺地委、行署从保持现行政策的稳定性和连续性入手，消除企业干部职工思想疑虑，使一度滑坡的工业生产呈现新的局面。10月份全区完成工业总产值创今年以来最高水平。
    今年头3个季度，安顺地区累计完成工业总产值仅为年度计划的64.5％。面对这种严峻局面，地委、行署领导深入企业经调查发现，生产下滑固然有资金、原材料、能源和交通运输等紧张的原因，但人们对厂长负责制、企业承包制和具体经营政策存在的某些疑虑，已明显地影响了企业干部集中精力组织、指挥生产。
    为此，国庆节刚过，地委、行署立即召开全区工业生产紧急会议，明确宣布：以经济建设为中心的指导思想不变；企业承包制稳定不变；厂长负责制不变；厂长和书记只是分工不同，职责都一样，要齐心协力抓好企业生产。
    稳定政策使企业吃了定心丸。不少厂长说：领导能了解民情，体谅企业的难处，我们就可放心大胆地抓生产经营了。许多企业开展双增双节运动，以确保完成今年生产任务。地区领导还同有关部门组织了几个工作组，下到全区11个县、市现场办公，就地帮助解决问题。
    仅短短一个月，安顺地区企业生产迅速出现转机。10月份，轻工业系统完成产值比9月份增长25％。
