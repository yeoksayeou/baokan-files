    Stability is Paramount
    — A Report on the Thought and Political Work of the Dalian Municipal Party
    By Song Shiqi, Reporter of People's Daily, and Sha Xiumin, Reporter of Dalian Daily

    This spring and summer, during the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, Liaoning’s Dalian, like other cities, was also affected. However, from an overall perspective, Dalian maintained social stability.

    Seventeen institutions of higher learning, except for some students from a few schools who marched and demonstrated in the city center and a few who sat in protest, saw very few citizens gathering around, let alone many "supporting" them. Students who tried to rally workers were sternly rejected. The students who sat in protest in the square eventually withdrew after persuasion.

    Throughout the turmoil and the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, Dalian did not have a single incident of looting, arson, or setting up roadblocks. No enterprise stopped production, traffic was never blocked, and citizens' lives remained basically normal.

    Shortly after the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing was suppressed, two major international economic and trade activities, the International Economic and Technological Seminar and the Northeast Region and Inner Mongolia Export Commodities Fair, were successfully held here one after the other.

    The turmoil that affected many cities did not gain traction in Dalian. Whenever this topic was discussed, people would unanimously say that Dalian's "microclimate" was relatively good.

    Dalian's "microclimate" includes many aspects, such as a united and harmonious atmosphere, economic stability, and improvements in social customs and public security. During our visit to Dalian, we were most impressed by the Dalian Municipal Party Committee's emphasis on party building and ideological and political work over the past few years.

    “The microclimate can be improved”

    In recent years, especially since Zhao Ziyang took charge of the central work, the leadership of the Party has been weakened, and ideological and political work has been reduced. The national "macroclimate" affected Dalian's "microclimate." Some grassroots party organizations were weak and dispersed, and some Communist Party members showed a clear decline in ideology, shifting from emphasizing spirit to emphasizing practical benefits; from emphasizing duty to emphasizing price; from emphasizing contribution to emphasizing taking...

    The repeated shocks of the national "macroclimate" caused waves of fluctuation in the grassroots party organizations in Dalian's government agencies, enterprises, schools, and neighborhoods. People discussed it a lot. The enthusiasm of party workers was affected. Many old comrades who had been engaged in party work for many years had never felt so uncomfortable. Many comrades were initially surprised and confused, then began to doubt and think, feeling more and more that something was wrong. Some party secretaries of large and medium-sized enterprises, starting from the cause of the party, loudly called out: "Now the party committee of the enterprise has retreated to the north of the 'Dasha River.' No matter what, we cannot retreat any further. If we retreat any further, it will be abolished!"

    The sharp problem was placed before the Standing Committee of the Dalian Municipal Party Committee. The Standing Committee clearly saw that the national "macroclimate" had problems; the spiritual civilization construction of our country had slipped; the national "macroclimate" we could not change, but we should manage Dalian. Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Bi Sizhen said more clearly that the responsibility of the Municipal Party Committee was to do its utmost to strengthen the construction of grassroots party organizations, strengthen ideological and political work, create Dalian's own "microclimate," and reduce the impact of this slip to the lowest possible level.

    Creating Dalian's own "microclimate" was not an easy task, and it required a certain amount of courage to withstand it.

    The Municipal Party Committee's work on party building and spiritual civilization construction was powerful. Many people introduced to us the Municipal Party Committee's plans for cadre education and spiritual civilization construction development. This was not just a superficial piece of paper. For a full four years, regardless of the winds blowing outside, the Municipal Party Committee insisted on implementing the plan step by step.

    After the student unrest in 1986, the Municipal Party Committee clearly proposed that all colleges and universities in the city, including those implementing the president's responsibility system, should have their ideological and political work led by the party committee. The Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government allocated special funds to regularly hold training classes for college counselors, training 800 people in two batches. The Municipal Party Committee Secretary and the Mayor held two college counselor meetings each year, giving reports and listening to their joys and sorrows. Several college party committee secretaries said that in recent years, while other places abolished counselors, here they were trained at Bangchui Island in the summer and visited at the end of the year, making the counselors feel warm at heart.

    Last year, for a period of time, the trend of "part-time" ideological and political work was strong, and the slogan of "cutting political workers by half and doubling economic efficiency" also blew into Dalian. After careful investigation and research, the Municipal Party Committee decided that the party committee secretaries of large enterprises should not be concurrently held by deputy factory directors, and that the proportion of full-time political workers in large and medium-sized enterprises should be maintained at a certain level. Political workers in enterprises were evaluated for professional titles. Political workers enjoyed the same treatment as other cadres in terms of salary, bonuses, and housing.

    Just as the so-called "elite" in Beijing was spreading that kind of liberalization goods everywhere, Dalian invited a model reporting team to tour and report in various colleges and universities. The Municipal Party Committee leaders have repeatedly said that inviting "celebrities" to give lectures and speeches in colleges and universities should be carefully selected and should not allow some people to spread poison on our podiums.

    In early May this year, after Zhao Ziyang's speech at the ADB meeting, many college leaders felt that the central government had two voices and were unsure. Some enterprise leaders also felt that there was a big deal and unclear threads. The Municipal Party Committee invited the responsible persons of grassroots party organizations to come, and the Municipal Party Committee responsible persons, based on the spirit of the "April 26" editorial of the People's Daily, clearly told everyone that our policy is to maintain the stability of Dalian, and it is correct to grasp the stable situation. Grassroots party organizations saw that the Municipal Party Committee's attitude was firm and the banner was clear, feeling that they had a backbone. The upper and lower levels united as one, and many problems were solved in their infancy, maintaining social order and stability.

    Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Bi Sizhen told us that in recent years, the Municipal Party Committee often talked about the "microclimate," emphasizing the need to create Dalian's own "microclimate." Now it seems that grasping the "microclimate" is correct. Even if the "macroclimate" is unfavorable, as long as we dare to start from reality, stand up straight and work continuously, the "microclimate" can be improved.

    The focus of work is on the grassroots

    In Dalian, we deeply felt that the political quality of grassroots party organizations and party members was relatively high. At critical moments, they maintained discipline, were mobilizable, and responded flexibly.

    In mid-to-late May this year, some people pasted big and small character posters all over the streets in the center of Dalian, spreading rumors and misleading people. The West District Party Committee decided that the Communist Party members in the district government and various neighborhoods should come out, go to the streets to remove the slogans, and be ready to respond at any time. At first, they removed the posters at night after others pasted them during the day, often working until late at night. Before dawn, all the big and small character posters were gone. Later, they did not wait until night, removing the posters as soon as they were pasted. Those people did not give up, and the party members argued with them, acted according to the law, maintained the city's management regulations, and firmly removed and cleaned the slogans and character posters.

    After the suppression in Beijing, many students who were studying in Beijing returned to Dalian. The neighborhood party members heard the news and went door-to-door to visit each one, understand the situation, and observe the trends. To find out if there were any wanted people in their responsibility area, an old Communist Party member who retired at home wore glasses and memorized the photos in the newspaper over and over again until she confirmed that there were no such people, and then she reported to the neighborhood party committee.

    We heard many similar examples. Whether in government agencies, enterprises, schools, or shops and neighborhoods, the party organizations were active, and party members were firmly guarding their posts, using party nature and party discipline to restrain themselves.

    In just over a month, the West District Party Committee held a series of meetings: a district-wide ideological and political work conference, an anti-corruption conference, a party building experience exchange conference, a party representative conference, and a "Three Excellent and Two Advanced" commendation conference.

    District Party Committee Secretary Liang Zhumin said emotionally, "We are at the grassroots level. Seeing the party in trouble and unable to use its strength, we are not happy. We can only work harder, and in special times, we show special alertness, special unity, special work efficiency, and special work results, letting people know that our party is invincible." Zhang Shizhong, the party committee secretary of Dalian Heavy Machinery Factory, said the same thing: "We want to show the value of the party's work through our work, the value of the existence of party members, and the value of the existence of party organizations."

    At the critical moment when the party and the state encountered difficulties, the grassroots party organizations in Dalian did not fall apart, showing a high degree of discipline, strong cohesion, and combat effectiveness. This is inseparable from the Municipal Party Committee's emphasis on laying a solid foundation in recent years.

    Dalian is an old industrial city. Among its 5 million people, there are 1.3 million industrial workers. The Municipal Party Committee determined that if the enterprises are stable, Dalian will be stable; if the grassroots are stable, the whole city will be stable. The Municipal Party Committee, starting from the characteristics of Dalian with many enterprises and institutions of higher learning, firmly grasped these two fronts, placed the focus of work at the grassroots level, and always paid attention to strengthening party building and improving the quality of party members.

    The Municipal Party Committee held several special work meetings to clarify the direction and tasks of grassroots party organization construction, summarized and promoted a batch of typical experiences of urban and rural grassroots party construction, commended 100 outstanding party branch secretaries; implemented four party management party systems of regular party discussions, party building work meetings, party work report inspections, and party building target management throughout the city; unified teaching materials, unified training, and unified class hours, and conducted basic theory and party line education for more than 80% of party members, which all played a good role in improving the quality of party members.

    The idea of focusing work on the grassroots was also fully reflected in the turmoil of this spring and summer. The Municipal Party Committee held five city-wide party member and cadre conferences and fourteen work conferences attended by responsible persons of grassroots party organizations. Some enterprise and college party committee secretaries told us that during that period, there was a meeting every one or two days. Whatever spirit the central government had, whatever the Municipal Party Committee had, they almost called us every day, and the stick reached the grassroots.

    On April 26, the Municipal Party Committee invited the responsible persons of grassroots party organizations to the city to convey the important spirit of the Party Central Committee regarding the turmoil in Beijing. The meeting ended at around four or five in the afternoon. The comrades who attended the meeting rushed back to their units and immediately held meetings to convey the information. In just a few hours, the voice of the central government was transmitted to the hearts of the vast majority of party members through the smooth channels of the party organizations.

    It is clear that strengthening the grassroots party organizations and giving full play to the role of party members makes the higher-level party committee's words effective and makes it possible to command. If this condition is not met, in such an extremely complex and severe struggle, even if the Municipal Party Committee grasps it tightly, it can only be a "bare commander."

    Abandon outdated things and create new experiences

    Since last year, the clamor to "reform" ideological and political work has been getting louder and louder. Under the guise of "reform," the intention is to "abolish." The Municipal Party Committee could not understand it. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the party's line, principles, and policies have been implemented and carried out, relying on ideological and political work? But the "reform" had a big "background," and it was not good to openly oppose it. The Municipal Party Committee changed it a bit, "distorted" the original intention of the "reform" talk, and used very clear language to require grassroots party organizations to inherit the fine traditions of the party's ideological and political work, abandon outdated things, and strive to create new methods and new experiences.

    We visited more than a dozen units. The ideological and political work of each unit was so vivid and attractive.

    Dalian Port has a West Port Company. In 1987, the company launched the "Three Loves" activity, that is: love the party, love the port, love the post; in 1988, it launched the "Three Goods" activity, that is: "the Communist Party is good, socialism is good, the reform and opening-up situation is good"; this year, it launched the "Love the Party Heart Series Activity." Workers said that our ideological and political work has a theme every year, the field expands every year, and the activities are lively.

    The "Enterprise Spirit" discussion of the Dalian Chemical Industry Company is more distinctive, which was created by them in 1986 when they had "no way out." Aiming at the actual situation of the factory, the company party committee proposed "hard work, full dedication, and striving forward" twelve characters as the enterprise spirit, and spent a full year educating all the workers of the factory, enhancing the workers' sense of responsibility for the factory. Since then, the enterprise spirit has developed year by year, deepening towards higher levels such as professional ethics, discipline, and ideals.

    The "Know Our Steel, Love Our Steel, Develop Our Steel" activity of the Dalian Steel Plant, the vocational ethics education of the transportation industry, and the "Old Wharf Spirit" education of the Dalian Port all carried forward the spirit of patriotism and hard work, mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, and enhanced the cohesion and attractiveness of the enterprises.

    Comrade Bi Sizhen told us that the enterprise party committee managed ideological and political work through the enterprise spirit. The Municipal Party Committee promptly promoted the "Great Chemistry" enterprise spirit discussion and expanded the experience of "Great Steel" to the whole city, launching a series of educational activities of "Know Dalian, Love Dalian, Develop Dalian," concentrating on propagating Dalian's glorious traditions, economic advantages, and development prospects, and mobilizing the people of the whole city to contribute to "Develop Dalian." For a period of time, there was a new "viewpoint" today and a new "theory" tomorrow. We grasped the enterprise spirit and did not waver.

    Talking with the party committee secretaries of colleges and universities also made us feel that their ideological and political work was very active and detailed. The education of students was mostly integrated into rich and colorful entertainment activities.

    During the turmoil in May and June, many places were in chaos, but some schools in Dalian held vocational ethics speech contests, carried out campus civilization months, and even held art festivals and sports meets. The 14 departments of Liaoning Normal University performed 18 shows during the school art festival, most of which were created by the students themselves, from May 6th to 14th. On the 15th and 16th, they held a school-wide sports meet. The tight rehearsals and competitions attracted most of the students. The deputy secretary of the school party committee said with some emotion: "Idle hands are the devil's workshop." This saying is reasonable. Young students are full of energy and lively. If you do not organize them to carry out beneficial activities, wrong things will take advantage of the opportunity to sneak in, and even trouble will be caused. The turmoil and rebellion made us reflect. How to do ideological and political work in the future still has many topics to explore.

    首要的是稳定
    ——大连市党的思想政治工作采访记
    本报记者　宋世琦　《大连日报》记者　沙秀敏
    今年春夏之交，在北京发生动乱和反革命暴乱期间，辽宁大连同其它城市一样，也受到了冲击。但从整体上看，大连市的社会却保持着安定。
    十七所高等院校，除部分院校的部分学生到市中心广场游行示威、少数学生静坐外，市民很少有人围观，更没有多少人“声援”。学生到工厂串联，遭到工人严辞拒绝。在广场静坐的学生，终经劝说撤回学校。
    在整个动乱和北京发生反革命暴乱期间，大连市没有发生一起打砸抢烧事件，没有设置一处路障，没有一个企业停工停产，交通没有一天堵塞，市民生活基本正常。
    北京刚平息反革命暴乱不久，两次大型的对外经贸活动，国际经济技术研讨会和东北地区暨内蒙古出口商品交易会先后在这里召开，均获得了圆满成功。
    涉及许多城市的动乱，在大连没有形成气候。每当议论起这个话题，人们总是不约而同地说这里的“小气候”比较好。
    大连的“小气候”，包括的内容很多，有团结和谐的局面，经济上的稳定，社会风气和社会治安的好转。我们在大连采访中印象最为深刻的，是大连市委几年来对党的建设和思想政治工作的重视。
              “小气候”是可以搞好的
    近几年，特别是赵紫阳同志主持中央工作以来，党的领导被淡化了，思想政治工作被削弱了。全国的“大气候”影响着大连的“小气候”。某些基层党组织软弱涣散，一些共产党员思想明显退坡，由讲精神退到讲实惠；由讲义务退到讲价钱；由讲奉献退到讲索取……
    全国“大气候”的一次又一次冲击，在大连市机关、企业、学校、街道等基层党组织中引起阵阵波动，人们议论纷纷。党务工作者的积极性受到影响。一些多年从事党务工作的老同志，心情从来没有这样不舒畅。不少同志开始是惊讶、惶惑，进而怀疑、思考，越来越感到不对劲。一些大中型企业的党委书记从党的事业出发，大声疾呼：“现在企业党委已经退到‘大沙河’以北了，无论如何不能再退了，再退就取消了！”
    问题尖锐地摆在大连市委常委面前。常委清醒地看到，全国的“大气候”出了问题，我们国家的精神文明建设发生了滑坡；全国的“大气候”我们扭转不了，但我们应该管好大连这块地方。市委书记毕锡桢说得更加明确，市委的责任，就是尽最大的努力，加强党的基层组织建设，加强思想政治工作，创造大连自己的“小气候”，使这种滑坡在大连的影响减小到最低的程度。
    创造大连自己的“小气候”，并非一件易事，没有一定的胆识是顶不住的。
    市委抓党的建设和精神文明建设是有力的。许多人向我们介绍过大连市委有关干部教育的规划和精神文明建设发展方案。这不是那种一纸空文式的表面文章。整整四年时间，不管外面刮什么风，市委坚持按规划一步一步实施。
    1986年的学潮之后，市委明确提出，全市包括实行院、校长负责制在内的所有高校，思想政治工作都由党委领导，市委、市政府拨专款定期举办高校辅导员培训班，两批培训了800人次。市委书记和市长每年出面召开两次高校辅导员会议，为他们做报告，倾听他们的苦与乐。几位高校的党委书记说，这几年别的地方取消辅导员，我们这里是夏天到棒锤岛培训，年终慰问，辅导员心里热乎乎的。
    去年有一段时间，思想政治工作“兼职化”之风甚烈，
  “政工干部砍一半，经济效益翻一番”的论调也吹到了大连。市委经过认真调查研究，决定大型企业党委书记不由副厂长兼，大中型企业专职政工干部必须保持一定的比例。对企业政工干部评定职称。政工干部在工资、奖金、住房等方面，与其它干部享受同等待遇。
    就在北京的所谓“精英”四处游说那套自由化货色时，大连却请来英模讲演团到各院校巡回报告。市委领导同志讲过多次，请“名人”到高校讲课、演讲，要精心选择，不能让有些人在我们的讲台上大模大样地放毒。
    今年5月初，赵紫阳在亚行会议讲话之后，许多高校的负责同志感到中央有两个声音，心中没底。一些企业的负责人也感到来头不小，头绪不清。市委把基层党组织负责人请来，市委负责同志根据人民日报“四·二六”社论精神，明确告诉大家，我们的方针就是要维护大连市的稳定，抓稳定局势没有错。基层党组织看到市委态度坚决，旗帜鲜明，感到有了主心骨。上下团结一致，许多问题在萌芽状态便得到了解决，保持住了社会秩序的安定。
    市委书记毕锡桢对我们说，这几年市委总爱讲“小气候”，强调要创造大连自己的“小气候”。现在看来，抓“小气候”是对的。即使“大气候”不利，只要敢于从实际出发，理直气壮、持续不断地工作，“小气候”是可以搞好的。
              工作的重点放在基层
      在大连，我们深感基层党组织和党员的政治素质比较高，关键时刻守纪律，调得动，上下呼应，动转灵活。
      今年5月中下旬那几天，一些人在大连市中心的街道上到处张贴大小字报，传播谣言，蛊惑人心。西岗区委决定，区机关、各街道的共产党员站出来，上街清除标语，随叫随到。开始，是人家白天贴，他们晚上揭，常常干到深夜。天亮之前，大小字报荡然无存。后来，干脆不等到晚上，白天随贴随揭，那些人不依不饶，党员们据理力争，依法办事，维护城市有关的管理条例，硬是把标语、大小字报揭掉、刷净。
      北京平暴后，不少在京读书的学生返回大连。街道的党员闻讯，登门串户逐个拜访，了解情况，观察动向。为了解自己责任区内有无被通缉的人员，一位退休在家的老共产党员，戴着花镜把报纸上的照片记了一遍又一遍，直到证实没有这些人，她才放下心来，向街道党委做了汇报。
    类似的事例，我们听过不少。不论是机关、企业、学校，还是商店、街道，党的组织都在活动，党员都在坚守自己的岗位，用党性、党纪约束自己。
    一个多月内，西岗区委竟连续召开了全区思想政治工作大会、廉政会、党建经验交流会、党员代表大会和“三先两优”表彰会。
    区委书记梁忠敏动情地说，我们身在基层，眼看党在困难中有劲使不上，心里不是滋味，只能加倍工作，在特别时期表现了特别的警觉，特别的团结一致，特别的工作效率和特别的工作效果，让人们知道我们党是任何人也战胜不了的。大连重型机器厂党委书记张士忠说的是同一个意思：我们要通过自己的工作，表现党的工作的价值，党员存在的价值，党组织存在的价值。
    在党和国家遇到危难的关键时刻，大连的基层党组织没有散架子，表现出高度的纪律性，表现出很强的凝聚力和战斗力，这是与市委近几年重视打基础的工作分不开的。
    大连是个老工业城市。500万人中，有130万产业工人。市委认定，企业稳定，大连就能稳定；基层稳定，全市就能稳定。市委从本市企业多、高等院校多这个特点出发，紧紧抓住这两个阵地，把工作的基点放在基层，始终注重抓党的建设，提高党员的素质。
    市委多次召开专门工作会议，明确基层党组织建设的方向和任务，总结推广了一批城乡党的基层建设的典型经验，表彰了百名优秀党支部书记；在全市推广实行定期议党、党建工作例会、党务工作报告检查、党的建设目标管理等四项党管党制度；在全市统一教材、统一轮训、统一课时，对80％以上的党员进行了初级阶段理论和党的基本路线教育，提高党员的素质，都起到很好的作用。
    工作重点放在基层的思想，在今年春夏之交的风波中，也得到了充分体现。市委先后召开了五次全市党员干部大会，十四次由基层党组织负责人参加的工作会议。一些企业和高校的党委书记对我们说，那一段时间是一两天一个会，中央有什么精神，市委有什么部署，几乎天天给我们打招呼，一杆子插到基层。
      4月26日，市委把基层党组织负责人请到市里，传达党中央有关北京发生动乱的重要精神。会议结束时，已是下午四五点钟了。参加会议的同志急如星火，赶回单位，立即开会传达。仅仅几个小时，中央的声音就通过党组织畅通的渠道，传到了绝大多数党员的心中。
    事情十分明显，抓好基层党的组织，发挥党员的作用，上级党委说话才灵，才指挥得动。如果没有这一条，在这样异常复杂、严峻的斗争中，市委抓得再紧，也只能是“光杆司令”了。
        扬弃过时的东西　创造新鲜的经验
    从去年起，“改造”思想政治工作的舆论一阵高过一阵。名曰“改造”，实为“取消”。市委想不通，十一届三中全会以来，党的路线、方针、政策得以贯彻、落实，靠得还不是思想政治工作？但“改造”之说大有“来头”，公开不好顶。市委变通了一下，“歪曲”了“改造”说的本意，用十分明确的语言要求基层党组织，继承党的思想政治工作的优良传统，扬弃过时的东西，努力创造新的方法，新的经验。
      我们采访了十几个单位。每个单位的思想政治工作都是那么有声有色，有吸引力。
    大连海港有个西部港务公司。1987年，公司开展了“三爱”活动，即：爱党、爱港、爱岗位；1988年，开展“三好”活动，即：“共产党好，社会主义好，改革开放形势好”；今年，又开展了“爱党心声系列活动”。工人们说，我们这几年的思想政治工作年年有主题，阵地年年有扩大，活动搞得有生气。
      大连化学工业公司的“企业精神”大讨论更具特色，那是他们在1986年“无路可走”时创造出来的。针对本厂的实际，公司党委提出“艰苦创业、全力奉献、奋发进取”十二个字为企业精神，用整整一年时间，对全厂职工进行教育，增强了职工爱厂如家的责任感。之后，企业精神年年都有新的发展，向职业道德、纪律、理想等更高层次深化。
      大连钢厂的“知我大钢、爱我大钢、兴我大钢”的活动，交通运输行业的职业道德教育，大连海港的“老码头精神”教育，都发扬了爱国主义和艰苦奋斗精神，调动了职工的积极性、创造性，增强了企业的凝聚力、吸引力。
      毕锡桢同志对我们说，企业党委通过企业精神把思想政治工作管起来。市委及时推广了“大化”企业精神的大讨论，又将“大钢”的经验扩大运用到全市，开展了“知我大连，爱我大连，兴我大连”的系列教育活动，集中宣传大连的光荣传统、经济优势、发展前景，动员全市人民为“兴我大连”做贡献。有那么一段时间，今天一个新“观点”，明天一个新“理论”，我们抓企业精神，一直没有动摇。
      同高校党委书记交谈，还让人感到他们的思想政治工作很活，很细。对学生的教育，大多寓于丰富多采的娱乐活动之中。
      动乱的五六月间，不少地方乱哄哄，大连市的一些学校院内却办起职业道德演讲比赛，开展校园文明月活动，甚至举办艺术节、运动会等等。辽宁师范大学14个系，在校艺术节期间登台演出了十八台节目，大部分由学生自己创作，从5月6日一直演到14日。15日、16日，又举办了全校运动会。紧锣密鼓的排练和比赛，吸引了绝大部分同学。对此，学校的党委副书记不无感慨地说：无事生非，这句话有道理。青年学生精力旺盛，活泼好动，你不组织他们开展有益活动，错误的东西就会乘虚而入，甚至会闲出事来。动乱和暴乱使我们反思，今后的思想政治工作怎么做，仍有许多课题需要探讨。
