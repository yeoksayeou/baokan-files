    The phrase “two sleeves of breeze” originates from the story of Yu Qian, an outstanding statesman and military strategist from the Ming Dynasty. From the early years of the reign of Emperor Xuande to the end of the reign of Emperor Zhengtong, Yu Qian served as a Censor, then as the Right Vice Minister of the Ministry of War, and finally as the Minister of War. He achieved remarkable results in his administration and was known for his integrity, refusing to flatter the powerful. When he was transferred to the capital, the practice of giving gifts and bribes was prevalent. Someone advised him to also bring some local specialties to give as gifts. He raised his two sleeves and laughed, saying, “I bring with me two sleeves of breeze.” He also wrote a poem titled “Entering the Capital”:

	“Silk handkerchiefs, mushrooms, and incense threads,
	Originally for the people's use, now causing harm;
	With two sleeves of breeze, I go to the court,
	To avoid the gossip of the common people.”

    This poem metaphorically represents the phrase “two sleeves of breeze,” which means being clean and poor, with nothing to one's name.

　　“两袖清风”的来历
    明朝杰出政治家、军事家于谦，自宣德初至正统末，由御史转兵部右侍郎升任尚书，政绩卓著，为官廉洁，绝不奉承权贵。他调任进京时，纳贿送礼之风盛行，有人劝他也带些土特产去送礼，他举两袖笑道：“我带有两袖清风”，并作“入京诗”云：
  “绢帕麻菇及线香，本资民用反为殃；清风两袖朝天去，免得闾阎话短长”。喻清贫廉洁、身无长物的“两袖清风”典出此诗。
