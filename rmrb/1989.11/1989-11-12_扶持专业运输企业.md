    Breakthroughs in key technologies will greatly promote the development of road transportation.

    Supporting Professional Transportation Enterprises
    Deputy Director of the Transportation Management Bureau, Ministry of Communications, Guo Shenghai

    The state-owned professional automobile transportation enterprises under the Ministry of Communications currently own 335,000 passenger and freight vehicles, accounting for 7.2% of the total number of civilian vehicles; there are nearly 2,000 state-owned transportation enterprises at the county level and above, of which about 300 are large and medium-sized backbone enterprises with more than 200 vehicles. In 1988, professional transportation enterprises completed 70% and 78% of the passenger volume and turnover respectively in the road transportation industry; they completed 11% and 13% of the freight volume and turnover respectively in the road transportation industry.

    Professional transportation enterprises, especially state-owned professional transportation enterprises, have always been the backbone of China's road transportation. They play an important role in promoting national economic development and meeting the needs of people's lives. In the first 30 years after the founding of the People's Republic, most of the road passenger and freight transportation was undertaken by professional transportation enterprises. After the reform and opening up, although there were multiple operators in the transportation sector, professional transportation enterprises still accounted for 80% of the total passenger turnover in road passenger transportation. In 1988, Shanxi Province transported 57,330 vehicles of coal, accounting for 70% of the total coal transportation in the province. In completing emergency transportation tasks, they played a key role. In early June of this year, during the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, Shanghai's professional transportation enterprises overcame various difficulties and completed the emergency transportation of production and living materials totaling 630,000 tons, solving the difficulties in factory production and people's lives.

    However, since 1985, professional transportation enterprises have generally experienced a "slump," with stagnant transport capacity development and a significant decline in economic benefits, and vehicle utilization efficiency has not been fully realized.

    In recent years, except for a slight increase in passenger cars each year, the number of freight vehicles has stagnated, and the number of trips has significantly decreased; profits realized have dropped from 10 billion yuan in 1985 to 4.28 billion yuan in 1988, and per capita retained profits have dropped from 266 yuan in 1984 to 145 yuan in 1988; the tonnage productivity of freight vehicles is only 75% of that in 1978, and the number of loss-making enterprises is increasing.

    The reasons for this situation are many, but the lack of effective macro-control and the inability to coordinate transport capacity development are important factors. The development of state-owned professional transport vehicles is slow, while the number of self-used vehicles by factories, mines, and enterprises has increased rapidly, and the number of individual transport vehicles has also increased rapidly. In the competition, some non-professional transport enterprises and individual transport operators have used unfair means to compete for passengers and freight, causing professional transport enterprises to retreat. At the same time, due to the rise in fuel prices, the low-input high-output situation makes it difficult for enterprises to stop the decline in economic benefits.

    The role of professional transportation enterprises, especially state-owned professional transportation enterprises, is crucial. Therefore, their difficulties cannot be ignored, and effective measures must be taken with enthusiasm to support their development.

    The key role of state-owned transportation enterprises, the auxiliary role of collective transportation enterprises, and the supplementary role of individual transportation must be clarified. A good order in the transportation market should be established, and equal competition should be carried out. Necessary vehicle replacement quotas and loan quotas should be given to professional transportation enterprises, and a tilted policy should be implemented to enhance the enterprises' self-development capabilities. At the same time, the potential within the transportation enterprises should be tapped, the management level should be improved, the basic work should be done well, diversified operations should be carried out, and economic and social benefits should be improved.

### 扶持专业运输企业

    本期要点
    国营专业运输企业是我国公路运输的中坚力量，应充分发挥作用；
    按照“全面规划，突出重点，平战结合，着眼未来”原则，加强国防边防公路建设；
    关键技术的突破会大大促进公路交通事业的发展。
    扶持专业运输企业
    交通部运输管理司副司长　郭生海
    我国交通部门所属的公有制专业汽车运输企业，目前拥有客货营运汽车33.5万辆，占民用车辆总数的7.2％；县以上国营运输企业近2000个，其中，拥有200辆汽车以上的大中型骨干企业约300个。1988年，专业运输企业完成的旅客运量和周转量分别占公路运输行业的70％和78％；完成的货物运量和周转量分别占公路运输行业的11％和13％。
    专业运输企业，特别是国营专业运输企业历来是我国公路运输的中坚力量，在促进国民经济的发展和满足人民生活需要方面，发挥着不可忽视的重要作用。建国后的前三十年，公路客、货运输绝大部分是由专业运输企业承担；改革开放后，虽然出现了多家经营运输的局面，但专业运输企业完成的旅客周转量仍占公路旅客运输总周转量的80％。山西煤炭外运，1988年共投入57330辆汽车，完成煤炭运量占全省运量的70％。在完成紧急运输任务中更是起着突击队作用。今年6月初，在平息反革命暴乱期间，上海市专业运输企业克服种种困难，突击完成生产、生活急用物资运输任务达63万吨，解决工厂生产、人民生活的困难。
    但自1985年以来，专业运输企业普遍出现“滑坡”现象，运力发展停滞，经济效益大幅度下降，车辆运用效率得不到正常发挥。
    近几年，除客车每年略有增加外，货车数量徘徊不前，而且车次明显下降；实现利润由1985年的10亿元降至1988年的4.28亿元，人均留利由1984年的266元降至1988年的145元；货车车吨产量只是1978年的75％，亏损企业也在逐步增加。
    造成这种情况的原因很多，但宏观调控不力，运力不能协调发展是重要原因之一。公有制专业运输车辆发展缓慢，而厂矿企事业自用车辆增长过快，个体运输车辆也迅猛增加，投入营业性运输的运力越来越多。竞争中，一些非专业运输企业和个体运输户使用了不正当手段争抢客货源，专业运输企业退避三舍。同时由于燃材料价格上涨，低进高出，企业经济效益很难阻止下滑。
    专业运输企业特别是国营专业运输企业的地位举足轻重，因此对他们的困难不能熟视无睹，必须满腔热情地采取有效措施，扶持其发展。
    要明确国营运输企业的骨干作用、集体运输企业的辅助作用和个体运输的补充作用。建立良好的运输市场秩序，开展平等竞争。对专业运输企业要给予必要的车辆更新指标和贷款指标，实行倾斜政策，增强企业自我发展能力。与此同时，还要挖掘运输企业内部潜力，提高经营管理水平，抓好基础工作，开展多种经营，提高经济效益和社会效益。
