The Editor's Note:

The Significant Issue of Grave Sites
Burial practices continue unabated, with the deceased occupying a significant amount of land that we intend to leave for our descendants to live on. The dead are increasingly threatening the living's survival. This is a problem that deserves our attention as we discuss how to cherish every inch of land. Currently, discussions on land issues rarely address this problem so sharply. We hope that everyone will bring up the urgent problems one by one, stimulate deep thought, find solutions, and make the discussion deeper.

According to the national civil affairs department, two years ago, the total land used for grave sites in rural areas across the country amounted to 1 million mu (approximately 166,667 acres). This is not a small number. More seriously, many people do not consider this an issue, neither now nor in the future. If this trend continues, the situation where our country loses 1 million mu of land each year due to grave sites will be difficult to reverse. Wenzhou City has taken the initiative to eliminate the public nuisance of disorderly and expanded grave sites by mobilizing the masses. It seems that all places will eventually have to make this decision.

    数目不小的坟头帐
    土葬绵延不绝，死人大量占据我们为子孙留下的养生之地，死人愈发威胁着活人的生存。这是我们探讨怎样珍惜每寸土地时，值得引起重视的一个问题。目前，土地问题的讨论，像这样尖锐地提出问题的稿件还不多。我们希望大家把急待解决的问题一个一个地提出来，引人深思，找出办法，使讨论不断深入。
    据国家民政部门透露，前年全国农村造坟占地总计100万亩，这不是一个小数。更为严重的是，相当多的人从不算这个帐，现在不算这个帐，今后似乎也不准备算这笔坟头帐，这样，我们国家每年因造坟减地100万亩的严峻局面将无法扭转。温州市把乱建和扩建坟墓作为一大公害发动群众来铲除，看来各地迟早得下这一决心。
