The State Administration of Foreign Exchange's Tibet Foreign Exchange Adjustment Center was recently established in Lhasa. This marks the establishment of a legally sanctioned foreign exchange adjustment market in Tibet, allowing for the rational flow of foreign exchange funds.

Tibet is the only province in China that retains a portion of its foreign exchange earnings. With the development of foreign trade and tourism in recent years, the number of enterprises in Tibet that retain foreign exchange has been increasing. In the first nine months of this year alone, foreign trade exports earned $9.6 million. The tourism industry earned another $2.3 million by the end of September. The region's total foreign exchange reserves have also increased compared to the same period last year, reaching over $48 million. From January to September, the Tibet Foreign Exchange Administration handled foreign exchange adjustment transactions totaling $13.55 million.
