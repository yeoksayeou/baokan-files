At the 12th Varna International Ballet Competition, Chinese performer Ou Lu danced the role of Prince Désiré in "The Sleeping Beauty" with such elegance, lyricism, refinement, and tranquility. Through his and his partner's clean and precise dance steps, light and agile jumps, and tender and affectionate dance movements, he depicted the prince and the sleeping beauty, a pair of lovers destined to be together, as if in a beautiful and enduring poem. The audience applauded and cheered for this 10-minute dance for a full 5 minutes. Soviet ballet authority Professor Gusyev excitedly praised, "The 'Sleeping Beauty' you performed fully reveals the inner world of the characters, which is something we have been trying to achieve for many years but have not succeeded in doing." This Chinese "prince" who caused a sensation in Varna and won the silver medal also won the silver medal at the 5th Osaka International Ballet Competition. Due to his multiple performances and teaching engagements in Japan, his fame there is very high.

In fact, his physical condition for dancing ballet was not ideal. He had poor calf muscles and suffered from Achilles tendinitis since childhood, but with the careful cultivation of teachers like Xu Dingzhong, he graduated with excellent results in 1979 and subsequently became a principal dancer in the Beijing Dance School Experimental Dance Troupe and the Central Ballet Troupe.

He has a tall and robust build, versatile technique, good sense of rhythm, and a wide range of acting skills. He is adept at using different techniques to portray different characters. In the ballets "Swan Lake," "La Bayadère," "The Family," and "The Little Mermaid," he created distinct characters such as the elegant Prince Siegfried, the handsome and bold Solor warrior, the victim of feudal etiquette Gao Jianxin, and the brave and kind hunter. In the first national ballet competition, he won the men's pair dance championship. He once performed "The Sleeping Beauty" with American Houston Ballet principal dancer Jenny Piek, earning high praise from American artists. Over the years, from Bangkok to Hong Kong, from Washington to Tokyo, from Varna to Bucharest, from London to Moscow, he has presented one exquisite artistic image after another to the world. In 1984, he enrolled in the Education Department of the Beijing Dance Academy, and after four years of hard study, his theoretical level and artistic cultivation have greatly improved. The characters he portrays are also more profound. Upon graduation, he also wrote a thesis titled "Psychology of Impromptu Performance."

Last year, after graduation, he stayed to teach, instructing ballet pair dance classes. Li Yan is one of his students. The 18-year-old Li Yan is graceful in appearance, well-proportioned in figure, and possesses a rare quality for a classical ballet performer. However, she had not yet starred in a major ballet. Li Yan's teacher, Tang Xiucun, invited Ou Lu to partner with Li Yan to participate in the 6th Moscow International Ballet Competition, solely to cultivate her during the competition. Ou Lu had exceeded the age limit for competitors and could not win an award, and he also had to take some risks. However, from more than two months before the competition, he diligently and wholeheartedly practiced with Li Yan every day. Due to Ou Lu's excellent support, lifting, and holding, Li Yan's dance movements became more varied, her poses more beautiful, and her pointe work fully displayed. Her performances of "Giselle," "The Sleeping Beauty," and "The Corsair" duets received high praise. Especially in the contemporary ballet work "The Last Moment," she and Ou Lu, with their smooth lines, expansive dance movements, and performances tinged with tragic colors, expressed the intricate and profound emotions of a couple bidding farewell in their final moments, moving the audience to tears. They defeated many competitors from other countries and won the bronze medal. It is no wonder that many foreign female performers were envious of Li Yan for having such a good partner in Ou Lu.

    舞坛“王子”的追求
    ——记欧鹿
    陈湘
    在第12届瓦尔纳国际芭蕾比赛中，中国演员欧鹿把《睡美人》中的杰齐烈王子演得那样潇洒、抒情、典雅、娴静，通过他和舞伴干净洗练的舞步、轻盈巧妙的弹跳、缠绵深情的舞姿，把王子与睡美人这对终成眷属的有情人描绘得犹如一首隽永的抒情诗。观众对这段10分钟的舞蹈竟鼓掌、欢呼长达5分钟之久。苏联芭蕾权威古雪夫教授兴奋地赞叹：“你们跳的《睡美人》能充分展现人物的内心世界，这是我们多年来一直想做而没有做到的。”这位轰动瓦尔纳、荣获银奖的中国“王子”，在第5届大阪国际芭蕾比赛中又获银奖。由于多次在日本演出、教学，他在日本的知名度很高。
    其实他跳芭蕾的身体条件并不理想，小腿肌肉不佳，自幼患跟腱炎，但经许定中等老师精心培育，1979年他以优异成绩毕业，先后在北京舞蹈学校实验舞蹈团和中央芭蕾舞团当主要演员。
    他身材魁伟、技术全面、乐感好、戏路宽，善于用不同技巧来塑造不同的人物。在舞剧《天鹅湖》、《舞姬》、《家》、《鱼美人》中，他塑造了风度翩翩的齐格菲王子、英俊豪放的索洛尔武士、封建礼教的牺牲者高觉新、勇敢善良的猎人等性格迥异的形象。在全国第一届芭蕾比赛中，他获双人舞男子桂冠。他曾与美国休斯顿芭蕾舞团女主演珍尼派克合演《睡美人》，深得美国艺术家好评。几年来，从曼谷到香港，从华盛顿到东京，从瓦尔纳到布加勒斯特，从伦敦到莫斯科，他把一个个优美的艺术形象奉献给世界人民。1984年他又考入北京舞蹈学院教育系，经四年刻苦学习，在理论水平和文艺修养方面大有提高，他塑造的人物形象也更有深度。毕业时他还撰写了一篇论文《临场发挥心理学》。
    去年毕业后，他留校任教，教芭蕾双人舞课，李颜是他的学生。18岁的李颜，容貌娟秀，身材匀称，具有一个古典芭蕾演员难得的气质。但她还没有主演过大舞剧。李颜的老师唐秀云邀请欧鹿为李颜伴舞去参加第6届莫斯科国际芭蕾比赛，完全是为了在参赛中培养她。欧鹿已超过选手年龄，不可能得奖，还要冒些风险，但从赛前两个多月起，他就天天一遍遍地倾心尽力地陪李颜排练。由于得到欧鹿出色的扶、托、举，使李颜的舞姿多采、造型优美、足尖技巧得以充分发挥，她跳的《吉赛尔》、《睡美人》、《海侠》双人舞都获好评。特别是在当代芭蕾作品《最后时刻》中，她和欧鹿用流畅的线条、舒展的舞姿、带有悲剧色彩的表演，把一对恋人告别人生前最后时刻种种幽微复杂的感情抒发得催人泪下，大获成功，战胜了许多国家的选手，荣获铜牌，难怪不少外国女演员都非常羡慕李颜有欧鹿这样好的舞伴。
