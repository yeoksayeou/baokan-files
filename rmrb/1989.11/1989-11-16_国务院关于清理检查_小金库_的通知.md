Edition: 2

The State Council issued a notice on the cleanup and inspection of "little gold safes" on November 14. The full text is as follows:

In recent years, many government agencies, organizations, enterprises, and public institutions have violated state financial regulations by setting up various forms of "little gold safes," which have persisted despite repeated bans. This is a major cause of the loss of state fiscal revenue and the rapid growth of consumption funds. It not only encourages extravagance and waste but also corrupts officials and undermines party discipline and social ethics. Therefore, the State Council has decided, in conjunction with the 1989 tax, financial, and price inspection, to conduct a comprehensive and thorough cleanup and inspection of privately set "little gold safes." The notice is as follows:

1. The cleanup and inspection of "little gold safes" is an important measure for rectification and strengthening of clean governance. All levels of party and government leaders must unify their thinking, raise their awareness, eliminate interference, and ensure that the cleanup and inspection of "little gold safes" are effectively carried out. Through the cleanup and inspection of "little gold safes," discipline must be strictly enforced, the rule of law strengthened, illegally occupied revenues recovered, and all financial revenues and expenditures brought under normal management and strict control.

2. All government agencies, organizations, enterprises, and public institutions, except for party dues, youth league dues, trade union dues, manuscript fees, and staff mutual aid funds, any revenues occupied, intercepted, or diverted from the state or the unit, or converted from public to private use, and not listed in the unit's financial and accounting departments for collection and expenditure, are considered "little gold safes" and must be cleaned up and inspected. This cleanup and inspection will primarily focus on the revenues and expenditures listed in "little gold safes" for 1988 and 1989, as well as the accumulated balances of "little gold safes" from previous years. From the date of this notice, all funds in "little gold safes" are strictly prohibited from being disbursed. Violators will be severely punished.

3. All government agencies, organizations, enterprises, and public institutions must have their leaders personally oversee the work of ideological mobilization, organizational implementation, and deployment arrangements. They must form a special team with the participation of financial and accounting personnel to quickly conduct self-inspections. They must actively clean up all forms of "little gold safes" within their units (including subordinate internal units and enterprises' workshops, departments, and offices) and truthfully report the revenues and expenditures of "little gold safes." They must not conceal or underreport. If such cases are found, the leaders and financial and accounting personnel of the unit will be held accountable. The deadline for self-inspection is no later than December 15. Units that have been listed as key inspection units by regions and departments for the tax, financial, and price inspection must include "little gold safes" as a major item and conduct thorough inspections. In addition, teams must be organized to select a batch of units for spot checks on "little gold safes" to prevent formalism. After this cleanup and inspection, all government agencies, organizations, enterprises, and public institutions are strictly prohibited from setting up "little gold safes."

4. For the funds discovered in the cleanup of "little gold safes," the principle of "leniency for self-inspection, strictness for inspection" will be strictly followed. For funds in "little gold safes" that are voluntarily self-inspected and reported within the self-inspection period, if they have been used for production and collective welfare, they must be transferred to the unit's financial and accounting department's accounts and handled as self-owned funds for collection and expenditure; if they have been used for staff bonuses, gifts, subsidies, and allowances, they must be included in the unit's total bonus issuance and the bonus tax must be paid according to regulations; the remaining balance, regardless of the source of funds, must be remitted to the finance department 50%, and the unit may retain 50%. The retained funds must be transferred to the unit's financial and accounting department's accounts and managed as self-owned funds of the unit.

For units that do not conduct thorough self-inspections and are found to have "little gold safes" by higher-level inspection teams, if the funds have already been used, regardless of the purpose, the unit must make up the funds with its own funds and remit them to the finance department; the remaining balance must be confiscated and remitted to the finance department, and a fine must be imposed. For serious cases with malicious intent, the leaders and financial and accounting personnel of the unit must be held accountable. If bribery or other criminal acts are found during self-inspection and inspection, they must be transferred to judicial authorities for legal punishment. The masses must be mobilized to actively report, and the identity of informants must be kept confidential. Informants who provide valuable information must be appropriately rewarded. Those who engage in retaliation must be severely punished.

5. The cleanup and inspection of "little gold safes" will be jointly responsible by the tax, financial, and price inspection offices and financial departments at all levels. The tax, financial, and price inspection offices and financial departments at all levels must appoint dedicated personnel to handle this work. Banks at all levels must actively support and cooperate to ensure the cleanup and inspection of "little gold safes" are effectively carried out. The State Council and local governments at all levels must open a special account for "little gold safes" inspection funds in the same-level bank. All funds from "little gold safes" that government agencies, organizations, enterprises, and public institutions should remit must be collected by the unit's financial and accounting department and remitted directly to the special account for "little gold safes" inspection funds opened by the same-level tax, financial, and price inspection office according to their affiliation (central, provincial, municipal, district, and county levels). If there is any delay in remittance, it will be dealt with as a violation of financial discipline. The tax, financial, and price inspection offices and financial departments at all levels, as well as the dispatched work teams and inspection teams, must strengthen supervision and inspection to ensure that all funds from "little gold safes" are promptly collected and remitted.

6. Specific regulations for the cleanup and inspection of "little gold safes" will be formulated and issued by the Ministry of Finance in conjunction with the State Council's tax, financial, and price inspection office. The cleanup and inspection of "little gold safes" in military units will be specifically regulated by the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army according to the spirit of this notice and reported to the Ministry of Finance and the State Council's tax, financial, and price inspection office for the record.

The regulations of this notice apply only to the cleanup and inspection of "little gold safes" and cannot be used for the inspection and handling of other issues in the tax, financial, and price inspection.

    国务院关于清理检查“小金库”的通知
    本报讯　国务院14日发出关于清理检查“小金库”的通知，全文如下：
    近几年来，不少机关、团体、企业和事业单位，违反国家财经制度，私设各种形式的“小金库”，屡禁不止。这是造成国家财政收入流失，消费基金增长过猛的重要原因之一，不仅助长了奢侈浪费，而且腐蚀干部，败坏党风和社会风气。为此，国务院决定，结合开展1989年税收、财务、物价大检查，对私设的“小金库”进行一次全面彻底的清理和检查。现通知如下：
    一、清理、检查“小金库”，是治理整顿、加强廉政建设的一项措施，具有重要的意义。各级党政领导一定要统一思想，提高认识，排除干扰，把清理和检查“小金库”切实抓好。要通过清理和检查“小金库”，严肃纪律，加强法制，把非法侵占的收入收回来，把各项财务收支纳入正常渠道，严格管理。
    二、所有机关、团体、企业和事业单位，除了党费、团费、工会会费、稿费提成和职工互助金等项目外，凡侵占、截留国家和单位的收入，化大公为小公、化公为私，未在本单位财务会计部门列收列支、私存私放的各项资金，均属“小金库”，都要进行清理和检查。这次清理、检查，主要是1988年和1989年列入“小金库”的各项收支，以及历年滚存的“小金库”结余。自本通知发布之日起，“小金库”的各项资金一律停止支付，违者要从严处理。
    三、所有机关、团体、企业和事业单位，都要由单位领导亲自挂帅，认真做好思想动员、组织落实和安排部署工作，组成有财会负责人参加的专门班子，迅速开展自查。要主动清理本单位（包括所属内部单位和企业的分厂、车间、班组和科室等）私设的各种形式“小金库”，如实上报“小金库”的各项收支金额，不得隐匿不报或避重就轻、报小不报大。发现有这类情况的，要追究单位领导和财会负责人的责任。自查的截止期限，最迟不得超过12月15日。各地区、各部门已列入税收、财务、物价大检查重点检查的单位，都要把“小金库”作为一项重要内容，认真进行检查。此外，还要组织力量，选择一批单位，对“小金库”问题进行重点抽查，严防走过场。经过这次清理和检查以后，所有机关、团体、企业和事业单位一律不准私设“小金库”。
    四、对于清查出来的各项“小金库”资金，要严格按照“自查从宽，被查从严”的原则进行处理。凡在自查期限内，单位主动自查自报的“小金库”资金，已用于生产和集体福利的，要转入本单位财务会计部门的帐目，在自有资金项下作列收列支处理；已用于职工奖金、实物、补贴、津贴的，要纳入单位奖金发放总额，按规定补交奖金税；余额部分，不分资金来源，一律上交财政50％，单位留用50％。留用的款项，全部转入单位财务会计部门的帐目，作单位自有资金管理。
    对不认真自查而被上级派出的检查组查出的各项“小金库”资金，凡已经支用的，不分资金用途，全部由单位用自有资金补足，上交财政；余额部分，全部没收，上交财政，并处以罚款。性质严重、情节恶劣的，还要追究单位领导和财会负责人的责任，在自查和被查中，如发现有贪污等触犯刑律行为的，应移交司法机关依法惩处。要发动群众积极举报，并为举报人保密。对举报有功人员，要适当给予奖励。对有打击报复行为的，要从重从严处理。
    五、清理和检查“小金库”的工作，由各级税收、财务、物价大检查办公室和财政部门共同负责。各级大检查办公室和财政部门要指派专人负责这项工作。各级银行要积极予以支持和配合，共同把清理、检查“小金库”的工作做好。国务院和地方各级政府的大检查办公室，要在同级银行开立“清查小金库资金”专户。各机关、团体、企业和事业单位应交的各项“小金库”资金，均由单位财务会计部门集中，并按其隶属关系（中央、省区市、地市、县区）直接汇交同级大检查办公室在银行开立的“清查小金库资金”专户。如有拖延不交的，按违反财经法纪论处。各级大检查办公室和财政部门以及派出的工作组、检查组，要加强监督检查，确保应交的各项“小金库”资金及时收缴入库。
    六、有关清理、检查“小金库”的具体规定，由财政部会同国务院税收、财务、物价大检查办公室另行制定，下达执行。部队各单位的“小金库”如何清理和检查，请解放军总后勤部根据本“通知”精神，作出具体规定，报财政部和国务院税收、财务、物价大检查办公室备案。
    本“通知”的各项规定，只适用于清理和检查“小金库”，对税收、财务、物价大检查中其它问题的检查和处理不能沿用。
