In the face of national financial difficulties, how can economically underdeveloped provinces and regions alleviate the shortage of educational funds? Henan Province has taken a proactive approach by vigorously developing school-run enterprises. The income from these enterprises has become an important source of educational funding. Last year alone, school-run enterprises contributed 67.966 million yuan to the educational sector.

Statistics show that currently, 47,510 schools in Henan have established school-run enterprises, accounting for 87% of the total number of schools in the province. These schools have leveraged their strengths to produce a wide range of products, from small items like mops and feather dusters to large machinery and equipment, totaling nearly 300 different products.
