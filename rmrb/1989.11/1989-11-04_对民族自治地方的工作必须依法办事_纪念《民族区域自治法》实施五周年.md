Regional ethnic autonomy is the basic policy of the Communist Party of China in solving the ethnic issues of our country, and it is an important political institution of the state. This policy and institution for solving the ethnic issues of our country is a product of the combination of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific conditions of China's ethnic composition, and it is an important embodiment of Mao Zedong Thought.

Since the establishment of the first ethnic autonomous region, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, on May 1, 1947, the 40-plus years of history have proven that the implementation of regional ethnic autonomy is in line with China's national conditions and is the only correct system for solving our ethnic issues. Precisely because it is correct, for decades it has always been attacked, slandered, and sabotaged by domestic and foreign enemies. During the ten-year turmoil, the two counter-revolutionary cliques of Lin Biao and Jiang Qing once went to great lengths to try to abolish and sabotage the system of regional ethnic autonomy. A small number of stubborn separatists who insist on Tibetan independence attempt to split the unity of the motherland and replace the Tibet Autonomous Region with so-called "Tibetan independence." In the recent counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, some people also targeted the system of regional ethnic autonomy, declaring that to solve the "Tibet issue" and other issues, "a federal-style state with a multi-party system" must be established, and they want to replace our system of regional ethnic autonomy with so-called "federalism." The actions of these hostile forces, from the opposite side, remind us: In China, to uphold the unity of the state, the unity of the ethnic groups, and the common prosperity of all ethnic groups, we must insist on implementing regional ethnic autonomy.

The Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy is a law that upholds the four cardinal principles, a law that upholds reform and opening up in ethnic autonomous regions, and a law that upholds the concentration of all efforts to build socialist modernization and promote the common prosperity of all ethnic groups. To seriously implement such a law, it relies on the broad cadres of the state organs to improve their level of Marxism-Leninism ethnic theory and ethnic policy, legal system, and the establishment of a proletarian ethnic viewpoint. It should be said that in recent years, the education of Marxism-Leninism ethnic theory and ethnic policy has generally weakened nationwide, and many cadres, including a large number of cadres newly promoted to leadership positions, are not familiar with ethnic policies and legal systems, especially they do not understand the important position of the policy of regional ethnic autonomy and the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy in our political life. For a period of time, bourgeois ethnic nationalism has grown, and especially in some publications and literary works, there have been continuous appearances of content that defames ethnic minorities and damages socialist ethnic relations. All of these are serious ideological obstacles to the implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy. We must learn from these lessons, strengthen the research and propaganda of Marxism-Leninism ethnic theory, and strengthen the propaganda of ethnic policy and ethnic legal system to remove ideological obstacles for the serious implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy.

Our system of regional ethnic autonomy is recognized by the Constitution. The Law of the People's Republic of China on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, adopted by the Second Session of the Sixth National People's Congress in 1984, has made basic regulations on China's system of regional ethnic autonomy. The promulgation and implementation of this law mark the beginning of a stage in which our country's ethnic minorities implement regional autonomy, and the state organs work in ethnic autonomous regions, which is basically governed by law and must be administered according to law. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in the article "Reform of the Leadership System of the Party and the State": "To make all ethnic minorities truly implement regional ethnic autonomy." Today, to insist on making all ethnic minorities truly implement regional ethnic autonomy, it must be to insist on administering according to the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, which is an important and indispensable legal concept that all cadres of the state organs at all levels in this multi-ethnic country should establish.

The system of regional ethnic autonomy, from a political point of view, is fundamentally two points: one is that the state structure of our multi-ethnic country is not a "federal system" but a unitary system, the National People's Congress is the highest state power organ, and the State Council, that is, the Central People's Government, is the highest state administrative organ, which is the central state organ to implement unified leadership over the whole country; the other is that ethnic autonomous regions where ethnic minorities are concentrated implement regional autonomy, establish autonomous organs, and exercise autonomous rights. Ethnic autonomous regions are not "states" or "constituent republics," but are local administrative regions, and autonomous organs are local state power organs at one level, and all ethnic autonomous regions are inseparable parts of the state, all of which must obey the unified leadership of the state. The Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy has made specific provisions for these two fundamental issues, and further made provisions for how the state leads, manages, and helps ethnic autonomous regions, and for the autonomous rights that the autonomous organs of ethnic autonomous regions can exercise according to law; it has made provisions for how the state guarantees the equal rights of ethnic minorities and the autonomous rights of ethnic autonomous regions, and for the autonomous organs of ethnic autonomous regions to maintain the unity of the state, ensure the observance and enforcement of the Constitution and laws in the local area, and actively complete various tasks assigned by the higher state organs. It is these provisions that maintain the unity of the state and the unity of the ethnic groups from a political and legal point of view. In the five years since the promulgation and implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, it has already taken deep root in the hearts of the broad ethnic minorities, and they regard this law as the crystallization of the fundamental interests of the state and their own ethnic group, and they have already connected the implementation of this law with the future of the state, the destiny of the ethnic group, and their own interests. Such an important law that has taken deep root among the broad masses of ethnic minorities, if it is not seriously implemented, the unity of the state and the unity of the ethnic groups will not be guaranteed; if the state does not administer according to law in ethnic autonomous regions and to all ethnic minorities, it will be a fundamental issue of losing the trust of the people and losing the trust of the ethnic minorities. This point, our state organs, and our state cadres must pay enough attention to.

Based on the long-term work of implementing regional ethnic autonomy since the founding of the country, in the past five years, the implementation of the relevant political clauses of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy in various places across the country has achieved remarkable results. First, since the promulgation and implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy to the 40th anniversary of the founding of the country, the State Council and relevant provinces and regions have taken active measures to establish 49 new autonomous counties, making a large number of ethnic minorities, including some newly restored ethnic groups such as the Manchu and Tujia, who have long been concentrated in areas, realize their long-standing desire to implement autonomy. Second, according to the provisions of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, the ethnic composition of the autonomous organs in all ethnic autonomous regions reflects the spirit of ethnic self-government and the right to manage their own internal affairs; the proportion of ethnic minority workers in the local workforce has increased in the past five years in all ethnic autonomous regions. Third, the people's congresses of many ethnic autonomous regions have formulated autonomous regulations and individual regulations according to law, and the standing committees of the people's congresses or the people's governments of some multi-ethnic provinces have formulated local regulations or administrative rules for implementing the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy. By the end of September 1989, 20 autonomous prefectures and 38 autonomous counties across the country had promulgated autonomous regulations; 6 multi-ethnic provinces had promulgated regulations for implementing the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy. This series of legal supporting measures for the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy is an important measure for implementing the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy and improving the system of regional ethnic autonomy. The serious implementation of the relevant political clauses of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy is conducive to the stability of the border areas, conducive to the formation of a stable and united situation across the country, and conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of all ethnic groups to develop production and promote the prosperity of economic and cultural construction, which is evident.

However, in the implementation of the relevant political clauses of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, there are still many problems, and the two most prominent ones at present are: one is that there are still disputes over the boundaries of some ethnic autonomous regions that have not been resolved, and some ethnic autonomous regions have not had enough prior consultation when adjusting their administrative divisions, resulting in some ethnic minorities feeling that their autonomous rights are not respected. Second, the work of formulating autonomous regulations for the five autonomous regions has not yet been officially promulgated and implemented due to various reasons, which involves the issue of how the autonomous organs of the autonomous regions exercise their autonomous rights according to law, and also involves the issue of how the relevant departments of the State Council take necessary special policies and measures according to the spirit of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy and the special circumstances of the ethnic regions to do everything possible to promote the accelerated economic and cultural development of the autonomous regions. The five autonomous regions all hope that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the State Council will give strong support and assistance to the autonomous regions to formulate their autonomous regulations as soon as possible.

The important mission of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy in this era is to use the law to guarantee the accelerated development of the economic and cultural construction of ethnic autonomous regions and promote the common prosperity of all ethnic groups across the country. To ensure the smooth progress of this important historical mission, the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy has made regulations in the aspects of finance, economy, and culture and education from two aspects: on the one hand, it regulates the autonomous rights that the autonomous organs of ethnic autonomous regions can exercise according to law in the aspects of finance, economy, and culture and education; on the other hand, it also regulates the leadership principles of the higher state organs for the economic and cultural construction of ethnic autonomous regions, the measures of assistance in the aspects of finance, materials, and technology, and the methods of developing resources in ethnic autonomous regions while considering the local economic interests. Therefore, the implementation of the clauses of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy in the aspects of finance, economy, and culture and education depends on the ethnic autonomous regions correctly exercising their autonomous rights according to law, and also depends on the higher state organs fulfilling their own responsibilities according to law. The implementation of these aspects of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy is not just a matter of "one side being enthusiastic," but must be "both sides being enthusiastic." On this issue, in the five years since the implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, from the side of the higher state organs, mainly from the State Council, the five autonomous regions and three multi-ethnic provinces have been given a lot of support and assistance in the aspects of finance, materials, and technology, especially the support for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the state has made great efforts. However, the comrades in the autonomous regions and multi-ethnic provinces believe that in the five years since the implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, whether it is the leadership methods for the economic work of ethnic autonomous regions, the financial management system for ethnic autonomous regions, or the methods for developing resources in the relevant autonomous regions, it is basically still following the practices before the promulgation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, and no new measures have been taken according to law. For example, not starting from the actual situation of ethnic autonomous regions, the phenomenon of treating the resolutions, decisions, orders, and instructions of ethnic autonomous regions the same as those of ordinary places still exists seriously; how to develop and utilize the resources of ethnic autonomous regions to take good care of the local interests is still a "difficult problem"; in the financial support for ethnic autonomous regions, there are still no relatively perfect regulations. Moreover, due to the implementation of the coastal strategy, the social and economic development of ethnic autonomous regions is increasingly widening the gap with the inland and southeastern coastal regions; in the policy of opening up to the outside world, the southeastern coastal regions are given more bold and liberal policies, while the northeastern, northwestern, and southwestern inland border ethnic regions are less open, and the policies are more rigid, making it difficult for these ethnic regions to play their resource and geographical advantages. The ethnic autonomous regions have reflected on these series of problems. At the National Conference on Ethnic Unity and Progress in 1988, Comrade Chen Junsheng, on behalf of the State Council, announced a series of "necessary measures" to support the economic development of ethnic minority regions, which is an important step for the State Council to guarantee the implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, and it was warmly welcomed by the ethnic peoples across the country at that time, and all ethnic autonomous regions had great expectations for the implementation of these measures. More than a year has passed, although the relevant departments of the State Council have done a lot of work, there are still many specific problems that have not been implemented. The comrades in the ethnic autonomous regions hope that these measures will be seriously implemented.

It should be said that in leading, helping, and supporting the economic and cultural construction of ethnic autonomous regions, many multi-ethnic provinces and autonomous regions have made a lot of efforts to follow the provisions of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy and have achieved remarkable results. First, as mentioned earlier, provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, Qinghai, Guangdong, and Hubei have promulgated specific regulations on the implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, reflecting the leadership principle of starting from the actual situation and paying attention to the characteristics of ethnic autonomous regions, reflecting the spirit of support from the aspects of finance, materials, and technology, as well as the spirit of decentralization and profit-sharing. Second, several multi-ethnic provinces have made great efforts in assisting the drafting and approval of autonomous regulations for the ethnic autonomous regions under their jurisdiction. In this regard, provinces such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Gansu are particularly outstanding. The formulation of autonomous regulations by ethnic autonomous regions is not only an important content of exercising autonomous rights according to law, but also actually an important legal guarantee for the comprehensive implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy and the exercise of autonomous rights in ethnic autonomous regions. From the content of more than 50 autonomous regulations of autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties that have been promulgated and implemented, they all start from the actual conditions of their own places and formulate feasible production and construction policies, ending the long-term practice of certain practices that are detached from reality and hinder economic development; they all start from the ethnic composition of their own places, and for the ethnic composition of the autonomous organs, they formulate the principle of cadre allocation that highlights the position of the main ethnic group and is conducive to the unity of all ethnic groups. The autonomous regulations and individual regulations that have been promulgated in various places are being gradually implemented. The work of ethnic legal system construction in the formulation of autonomous regulations and individual regulations in the past few years, as well as the role of the autonomous regulations and individual regulations that have been promulgated, should be fully affirmed. After the promulgation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, the Jilin Provincial Party Committee and the provincial government decided to transfer all 18 provincial enterprises in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture to the autonomous prefecture for management in the form of contracting, including both profitable and loss-making enterprises, including the famous tax-paying enterprises in the whole province. Since the transfer of these enterprises, the effect has been good, and the autonomous rights of the autonomous prefecture to manage the economic construction of the whole place have been implemented, the sense of responsibility and initiative of the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture have been strengthened, and it is also conducive to the autonomous prefecture's overall arrangement of the economy of the whole prefecture, conducive to the protection and rational development and utilization of natural resources, and conducive to the adoption of special policies and flexible measures to enhance the vitality of enterprises. Since the transfer of these enterprises to the autonomous prefecture, the tax revenue has doubled, which is beneficial to both the autonomous prefecture and the state. We should draw useful enlightenment from the experience of Jilin Province in implementing the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy.

Many ethnic autonomous regions reflect that the provisions of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy on the autonomous rights in the economic field are relatively general and difficult to implement specifically. It is undeniable that some articles of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy on economic issues are relatively general. This is because the situation of various ethnic autonomous regions is very different, making it difficult to be too specific; it is also because the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy was promulgated in 1984, when China's economic system reform had just started, and many issues in economic policies needed further experience to be summarized and it was not appropriate to be too rigid at once. From the practical experience of various places, in order to facilitate the implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, it is indeed necessary for the State Council to formulate specific regulations or measures for the implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, especially the regulations on economic issues, which are very much in need of being concretized in the relevant regulations of the State Council. This is the most urgent requirement of the ethnic autonomous regions at present for the implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in his speech at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China: "We should strengthen the construction of the legal system of regional ethnic autonomy," which fully accords with the wishes of the people of all ethnic groups across the country. I think that the formulation of the implementation measures of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy by the relevant departments of the State Council should be the most urgent task for strengthening the construction of the legal system of regional ethnic autonomy.

Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in his speech at the meeting on poverty alleviation work in ethnic minority areas: "The Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy is a scientific summary of China's implementation of the system of regional ethnic autonomy, and we should organize its implementation seriously." The serious implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy is related to the unity of the state and the unity of the ethnic groups, and it is related to the common development and common prosperity of all ethnic groups in China. Let us work together to seriously implement the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy and do a good job in all aspects of work in ethnic autonomous regions, and make more contributions.

    对民族自治地方的工作必须依法办事
    ——纪念《民族区域自治法》实施五周年
    阿沛·阿旺晋美
    民族区域自治是中国共产党运用马克思列宁主义解决我国民族问题的基本政策，是国家的一项重要政治制度。这项解决我国民族问题的政策和制度，是马克思列宁主义普遍真理同中国民族构成的具体情况相结合的产物，是毛泽东思想的重要体现。
    自1947年5月1日内蒙古自治区这第一个民族自治地方创立以来，40多年的历史证明，实行民族区域自治是符合中国国情的，是解决我们的民族问题的唯一正确的制度。正因为它是正确的，几十年来它总是遭到国内外敌人的攻击、污蔑和破坏。十年浩劫期间，林彪、江青两个反革命集团就曾千方百计地要取消和破坏民族区域自治制度。极少数顽固坚持西藏独立的分裂主义分子，妄图分裂祖国的统一，要以所谓“西藏独立”来取代西藏自治区。在最近发生的北京反革命暴乱中，也有人针对民族区域自治制度，宣称要解决“西藏问题”以及其他问题，“就必须建立一个多党政治的联邦式国家”，他们要用所谓“联邦制”来取代我们的民族区域自治制度。这些敌对势力的所作所为，从反面提醒了我们：在中国，要坚持国家的统一、民族的团结和各民族的共同繁荣，就必须坚持实行民族区域自治。
    民族区域自治法是坚持四项基本原则的法律，是坚持民族自治地方要改革开放的法律，是坚持要集中一切力量进行社会主义现代化建设，促进各民族共同繁荣的法律。要认真实施这样的法律，有赖于我们的国家机关的广大干部的马克思列宁主义民族理论和民族政策、法制水平的提高，有赖于无产阶级民族观的树立。应该说，近些年来，全国上下普遍地削弱了马克思列宁主义民族理论和民族政策的教育，许多干部，包括一大批新提拔到领导岗位的干部，不熟悉民族政策和法制，特别是不懂得民族区域自治政策和民族区域自治法在我国政治生活中所居的重要地位。一个时期以来，资产阶级民族主义思想有所滋长，特别是在有些出版物和文艺作品中，不断出现一些污辱少数民族、破坏社会主义民族关系的内容。所有这些，都是贯彻实施民族区域自治法的严重的思想障碍。我们必须从中吸取教训，加强马列主义民族理论的研究和宣传教育，加强民族政策、民族法制的宣传教育，为认真实施民族区域自治法扫除思想障碍。
    我们的民族区域自治制度，是由宪法所确认的。1984年六届全国人大第二次会议所通过的《中华人民共和国民族区域自治法》，对我国的民族区域自治制度作出了基本的规范。这个法律的颁布实施，标志着我国少数民族实行区域自治，我们的国家机关对民族自治地方的工作，进入了一个已是基本上有法可依，必须依法办事的阶段。邓小平同志在《党和国家领导制度的改革》一文中指出：“要使各民族真正实行民族区域自治”。在今天，坚持使各少数民族真正实行民族区域自治，必须是坚持按照民族区域自治法办事，这是今天我们这个多民族国家的各级国家机构的广大干部所应树立的一种重要的必不可少的法制观念。
    民族区域自治制度，从政治上说，最根本的是两条：一条是我们这个多民族国家的国家结构形式，不是“联邦制”，而是单一制，全国人民代表大会是最高国家权力机关，国务院即中央人民政府是最高国家行政机关，是由中央国家机关实行对全国的统一领导；另一条是各少数民族聚居的地方实行区域自治，设立自治机关，行使自治权。各民族自治地方不是“邦”，不是“加盟共和国”，而是一级地方行政区域，自治机关是国家的一级地方政权机关，各民族自治地方，都是国家不可分离的部分，都要服从国家的统一领导。民族区域自治法对这两个根本问题作出了具体规定，并进而既对国家如何领导、管理和帮助民族自治地方作出了规定，又对民族自治地方的自治机关依法可以行使的自治权作出了规定；既对国家如何保障少数民族的平等权利和民族自治地方的自治权利作出了规定，又对民族自治地方的自治机关必须维护国家的统一，保证宪法和法律在本地方的遵守和执行，以及积极完成上级国家机关交给的各项任务作出了规定。就是这些规定从政治上和法律上维系着国家的统一和民族的团结。民族区域自治法颁布实施5年来，它已在广大的少数民族心目中扎下了深根，他们把这个法律视为国家和本民族的根本利益的结晶，他们已把这个法律的贯彻实施，同国家的前途、民族的命运和本身的利益紧紧地连接在一起。这样一个深深扎根于广大少数民族群众之中的重要法律，如果得不到认真贯彻实施，国家的统一，民族的团结就没有保障；如果国家对民族自治地方、对各少数民族不能依法办事，就将是在一个根本性的问题上失信于民，失信于少数民族。这一点，我们的国家机关，我们的国家干部，必须足够的重视。
    在建国以来长期推行民族区域自治的工作基础上，5年来全国各地实施民族区域自治法所规定的有关政治方面的条款，应该说是成绩显著的。首先，自民族区域自治法颁布实施起到建国40周年，国务院和有关省、区采取了积极措施，新建立了49个自治县，使一大批聚居的少数民族，其中包括一些新恢复民族成份的满族、土家族等的聚居地方，实现了长期要求实行自治的愿望。其次，按照民族区域自治法的规定，各民族自治地方都在自治机关的民族组成上，体现了实行区域自治的民族当家作主，管理本民族内部事务权利的精神；民族职工在当地职工队伍中所占比例，5年来各民族自治地方普遍地有所提高。第三，许多民族自治地方的人民代表大会都在依法制定自治条例和单行条例，一些多民族省的人大常委会或人民政府，在制定贯彻实施民族区域自治法的地方性法规或行政规章。到1989年9月底，全国已有20个自治州、38个自治县颁布了自治条例；已有6个多民族省颁布了实施民族区域自治法的规定。这一系列民族区域自治法的法制配套工作，是实施民族区域自治法和完善民族区域自治制度的重要措施。民族区域自治法所规定的有关政治方面的条款的认真贯彻实施，有利于边疆地区的稳定，有利于全国安定团结局面的形成，有利于调动各族人民发展生产、繁荣经济文化建设事业的积极性，这是显而易见的。
    但是，在贯彻实施民族区域自治法所规定的有关政治方面的条款，也还存在不少问题，目前比较突出的有两个方面：一是有一些民族自治地方的边界存在纠纷，至今尚未解决，加上有的民族自治地方区划变动时，事先协商不够，致使一些少数民族感到自治权利得不到尊重。二是五大自治区制定自治条例的工作，由于种种原因至今一个也还没有正式颁布施行，这既涉及到自治区的自治机关如何依法行使自治权的问题，也涉及国务院有关部委如何根据自治法的精神和民族地区的特殊情况采取必要的特殊政策和措施，尽一切努力促进自治区加速经济文化发展的问题。五大自治区都希望全国人大常委会和国务院大力帮助和支持自治区尽快制定他们的自治条例。
    民族区域自治法的重要的时代使命，是用法律保障各民族自治地方加速经济文化建设事业的发展，促进全国各民族的共同繁荣。为了保证这项重要历史使命的顺利进行，民族区域自治法在财政、经济和文化教育上都是从两个方面作出规范的：一方面是规定民族自治地方的自治机关在财政、经济和文化教育上可以依法行使的自治权；另一方面又规定上级国家机关对民族自治地方进行经济文化建设的领导原则，从财政、物资和技术等方面的帮助措施以及在民族自治地方开发资源照顾当地经济利益的办法。因此，民族区域自治法关于财政、经济和文化教育方面所规定的条款的实施，既要依靠各自治地方依法正确地行使自治权，又要依靠各上级国家机关依法履行自己应尽的职责。民族区域自治法这些方面的贯彻实施，只是民族自治地方“一头热”是不行的，必须是“两头热”。在这个问题上，民族区域自治法实施5年来，从上级国家机关一方来说，主要是从国务院来说，对五大自治区和三个多民族省，无论是从财政、物资和技术等方面都给予了不少的支持和帮助，特别是对西藏自治区的支援，国家是尽了很大的努力的。但是，自治区和多民族省的同志认为：民族区域自治法实施5年来，无论从对民族自治地方经济工作的领导方法、对民族自治地方的财政管理体制，以及对在有关自治地方开发资源的办法等等，基本上还是沿袭民族区域自治法颁布以前的作法，没有依法采取必要的新的措施。譬如，不从民族自治地方的实际出发，对民族自治地方的决议、决定、命令和指示同一般地方“一刀切”的现象，仍严重地存在；开发利用民族自治地方的资源如何照顾好当地的利益，至今仍是“老大难”问题；在对民族自治地方的财政支持上，也还没有作出比较完善的规定。而且由于实行沿海战略，使得民族自治地方社会经济的发展与内地及东南沿海地区的差距在日益扩大；在对外开放政策上，对东南沿海大胆放手，放权让利也较多，而对东北、西北以及西南内陆边疆民族地区，则开放不够，政策卡得较死，使这些民族地区难于发挥自己的资源和地理优势。对这一系列问题，民族自治地方反映较多。在1988年的全国民族团结进步表彰大会上，陈俊生同志曾代表国务院宣布了支持少数民族地区经济发展所采取的一系列“必要措施”，是国务院保证实施民族区域自治法的重要步骤，当时很受到全国各民族人民的热烈欢迎，各民族自治地方都对这些措施的落实寄予很大希望。时过一年多，虽然国务院各职能部门作了很多工作，但仍有许多具体问题未能落到实处。民族自治地方的同志希望认真落实这些措施。
    应该说，在领导、帮助和支持民族自治地方的经济文化建设事业上，许多多民族省和自治区，对他们所属的自治州、自治县，都在努力依照民族区域自治法的规定，做了大量工作，并已取得了显著的成就。首先，如前所述，已有四川、云南、甘肃、青海、广东、湖北等省颁布了关于实施民族区域自治法的具体规定，体现了对所属民族自治地方坚持从实际出发、注重民族自治地方的特点的领导原则，体现了对民族自治地方从财政、物资、技术等方面的支援以及放权、让利的精神。其次，好几个多民族省，在协助所属民族自治地方起草和审批自治条例上，下了很大的功夫。在这方面，云南、贵州、湖南、甘肃等省，尤为突出。民族自治地方制定自治条例，既是依法行使自治权的一项重要内容，又实际上是在民族自治地方全面实施自治法，行使自治权的重要的法律保障。从已颁布施行的自治州、自治县50多个自治条例的内容看，它们都从本地的实际条件出发，规定了切实可行的生产建设方针，结束了长期以来某些脱离实际致使经济发展缓慢的作法；它们都从本地民族构成的特点，对自治机关的民族组成，规定了既突出主体民族的地位，又有利于各民族的团结的干部配备原则。各地已颁布的自治条例和单行条例，正在逐步实施。几年来各地制定自治条例和单行条例的民族法制建设工作，以及已经颁布的自治条例和单行条例所起的作用，应予充分肯定。民族区域自治法颁布以后，吉林省委、省政府决定，将在延边朝鲜族自治州的省属18个企业，全部以承包形式下放给自治州管理，无论盈利的、亏损的企业，其中包括全省有名的利税大户都一起下放。这批企业下放以来，效果是好的，落实了由自治州全面管理本地方经济建设的自治权，加强了自治州各族人民的责任心和主动精神，而且有利于自治州对全州经济的统筹安排，有利于保护和合理开发利用自然资源，有利于采取特殊政策和灵活措施增强企业活力。这批企业下放自治州以后，利税翻了一番，无论对自治州还是对国家都有利。我们应该从吉林省实施自治法的经验中得到有益的启示。
    许多民族自治地方反映，民族区域自治法关于经济方面的自治权的规定比较原则，难于具体贯彻实施。无庸讳言，民族区域自治法关于经济问题的某些条文是规定得比较原则。这是由于各民族自治地方的情况差别很大，难于规定得太具体；也由于民族区域自治法颁布的1984年，我国的经济体制改革还刚刚起步，经济政策上的许多问题有待进一步总结经验，不宜于一下子规定得太死。从各地的实践经验来看，为便于贯彻实施民族区域自治法，确实需要国务院制定具体实施民族区域自治法的细则或办法，尤其是关于经济问题的规定，很需要在国务院的有关规定中加以具体化。这是民族自治地方当前对贯彻实施民族区域自治法的一个最迫切的要求。江泽民同志《在庆祝中华人民共和国成立四十周年大会上的讲话》中强调指出：“要加强民族区域自治的法制建设”，这完全符合全国各族人民的心愿。我认为国务院有关部委制定民族区域自治法的实施办法，应是加强民族区域自治法制建设的当务之急。
      江泽民同志在少数民族地区扶贫工作会议上的讲话指出：“《民族区域自治法》是我国实行民族区域自治制度的科学总结，要认真组织实施。”民族区域自治法的认真贯彻实施，关系到国家的统一和民族的团结，关系到我国各民族的共同发展和共同繁荣。让我们共同努力，为切实实施民族区域自治法，为做好民族自治地方的各项工作，多作贡献。
