In the northern foothills of the Daba Mountains in Zhushan, a miracle has risen: a leading domestic-level forest chemical factory. This factory, with just over 200 employees, generated a production value of 10 million yuan and taxes and profits of 1.3 million yuan in the previous year, with export earnings of 100 million US dollars. The export earnings alone for one year are equivalent to the entire annual fiscal revenue of Zhushan County. The main creator of this miracle is Zhang Zonghe, the "visiting chief engineer" from Nanjing.

The Call of the Mountains

Deep in the dense forests of the Daba Mountains grows a lush tree known as the saltbush. Every spring and early summer, its leaves develop a "gall," a pouch-like growth caused by the aphid-like insect that parasitizes the saltbush leaves. This precious "gall" is known as gallnut. Chemicals produced from gallnut, such as tannic acid and gallic acid, are widely used in medicine, dyeing, and military industries. Gallnut is primarily divided into two types: abdominal gallnut and horn gallnut, with abdominal gallnut being more valuable. Zhushan County is famous nationwide for its abundant production of abdominal gallnut.

In the spring of 1984, the Hubei Provincial Economic Commission and the Provincial Forestry Bureau assigned Zhushan County a task: to build a production line capable of producing 100 tons of tannic acid annually using abdominal gallnut resources. This was a daunting challenge for the people of Zhushan, known as the "abdominal gallnut hometown." Although the county is renowned for its high-quality abdominal gallnut, generations have relied on exporting it as a raw material. Producing chemical products from abdominal gallnut was no easy task. The county leaders invited Zhang Zonghe, the deputy director of the Nanjing Institute of Forest Chemical Industry under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, along with researchers Xiao Zongyan and Xu Jin. Zhang Zonghe was appointed as the deputy chief engineer and chief engineer. In reality, he took on a comprehensive set of tasks, including resource verification, engineering design, equipment installation, and technical guidance. He even personally handled fund-raising and product sales.

Zhushan County invested significant financial and human resources into the construction of the forest chemical factory, viewing it as a key project for poverty alleviation and prosperity. For this impoverished county, which relies on annual fiscal subsidies and has an average income of just over 100 yuan per person, everyone understood: the forest chemical factory must succeed; failure was not an option.

Cement, lime, sand, and thousands of tons of construction materials were transported to the site; factory buildings, warehouses, and roads were under construction. Zhang Zonghe worked tirelessly, day and night, like a spinning top. Along with his team, he toiled for nine months, finally achieving a successful single-machine trial run on December 27, 1985. One thousand kilograms of tannic acid were produced, exceeding national standards in quality.

The Chief Engineer on the Sickbed

After the successful trial run of the tannic acid single machine, Zhang Zonghe, who suffered from gastric atrophy and gallstones, was admitted to the Zhushan Hospital. Lying in bed, he held blueprints with his left hand while receiving an IV, and with his right hand, he discussed work with the factory director and technical staff. People called him the "chief engineer on the sickbed."

A few days later, the factory reported issues: the dryer's blower effect was poor, and the shut-off valve could not seal properly. Zhang Zonghe could no longer stay in bed. He quietly returned to the factory, convening an emergency meeting to address the problems. The next day, despite his weakened condition, he climbed into the immersion tank, where the temperature reached 72 degrees Celsius. When he corrected the misplaced outlet and drain pipes and emerged, he was drenched in tannic acid steam, turning him into a peculiar "blue man." Several workers remarked, "If Zhang can climb into such a place, we truly feel ashamed of ourselves!"

A few days later, a copy of the *Hubei Daily* featuring a news photo titled "The Chief Engineer on the Sickbed" arrived in Nanjing, weighing heavily on his wife's heart. She urgently called the Zhushan County Hospital, only to be told that Zhang Zonghe had been transferred to the Yunyang Regional People's Hospital for further diagnosis. When she called the regional hospital, Zhang Zonghe had just begun to say, "I am Zonghe..." when his wife's sobs echoed through the receiver. After a long pause, his wife managed to say, "I have arranged a hospital for you. You will be returning to Nanjing tonight!"

"No! I will return to Zhushan for treatment."

Zhang Zonghe knew that if he left, the construction of the tannic acid production line would be delayed, and the equipment, which had been researched with hundreds of millions of yuan in loans, would be difficult to adjust and operate on schedule.

Two days later, his wife arrived in Zhushan, exhausted from the journey. Seeing his wife, what could Zhang Zonghe say? He had been living in the Daba Mountains for years, while his wife had to work, take care of the children, and manage the household. His wife's love touched him deeply but did not shake his resolve. Understanding her husband, on the fourth day, she declined the factory's offer to visit Wudang Mountain and hurriedly returned home. Indeed, what love in the world could be more intense and profound than devotion to one's career?

On August 5, 1986, a tannic acid production line, ranking among the best in the nation, was officially put into operation in Zhushan, a year ahead of schedule.

For the Daba Mountains

Zhang Zonghe always had one thing on his mind: as a "visiting chief engineer," he would eventually have to leave. What would happen to the factory then? Zhang Zonghe proposed establishing a vocational school to train local technical workers and researchers. After more than two years of effort, he and his colleagues trained over 70 technical workers for the factory and led more than 50 workers to Nanjing, Shenyang, and other places to learn new technologies and techniques.

"Tannic acid is just a single product. Only by developing into a series of deep-processing products can the factory have a brighter future." Zhang Zonghe designed the second, third, and fourth production lines in succession. After going into production, various products were sold both domestically and internationally.

On December 28 of the previous year, the results of the development and utilization of Zhushan's abdominal gallnut resources passed a ministerial-level appraisal. More than 20 experts and professors from the Forestry Department and the Chinese Forest Chemical Society, among other units, conducted an on-site appraisal and concluded that the project's technology was at the forefront of the nation and had entered the ranks of international leaders in the same industry. It was a major breakthrough in China's forest chemical industry, opening up new paths for the development and utilization of gallnut series products.

In addition to its own achievements, the Zhushan Forest Chemical Factory increased the annual income of farmers growing abdominal gallnut by nearly 7 million yuan, benefiting surrounding counties. Farmers' enthusiasm for growing abdominal gallnut has grown, with the county's new gallnut forest area increasing by over 65,000 acres in recent years. By 1990, the county's gallnut forest area is expected to reach 100,000 acres. The development of abdominal gallnut has become one of the key projects for poverty alleviation and prosperity in the Daba Mountains.

Some people believe that Zhushan must have given Zhang Zonghe generous compensation. During the interview, the reporter learned that the county committee originally decided to give him a monthly allowance of 200 yuan, but Zhang Zonghe insisted on not taking a single cent. Apart from the salary he received from the Nanjing Forest Chemical Institute, he had no additional income.

Last year, Zhang Zonghe was named an outstanding labor model in Hubei Province, a national outstanding scientific and technological worker, and received the national "May 1st Labor Medal."

    在大巴山中创造奇迹
    ——记优秀共产党员、高级工程师张宗和
    陈新洲　蔡远福
    在大巴山北麓的竹山里，奇迹般地崛起一座具有国内领先水平的林产化工厂。这个仅有200多名工人的林化厂，去年创产值1000万元，利税130万元，出口创汇100万美元。一年仅创汇收入就相当于竹山全县一年的财政总收入。这个奇迹的主要创造者叫张宗和，他是从南京来的“客座总工程师”。
    远山的呼唤
    大巴山深山密林中生长着一种枝繁叶茂的盐肤木，每当春末夏初，叶子上便长出一种
  “虫瘿”，那是倍蚜虫寄生在盐肤木上刺激叶细胞而形成的囊状瘤子。这种珍贵的“虫瘿”名叫五倍子。用五倍子生产的单宁酸、没食子酸等化工产品，广泛用于医药、印染、军工等行业。五倍子主要有肚倍和角倍两大类，肚倍比角倍更珍贵。竹山县就因盛产肚倍而在全国小有名气。
    1984年春，湖北省经委和省林业厅给竹山县下达了一项任务：利用肚倍资源建一个年产100吨单宁酸的生产车间。这可难坏了“肚倍之乡”的竹山人，尽管这里肚倍产量居全国之冠，而且质量闻名遐迩，可祖祖辈辈都是把肚倍作为原料出口呀！用肚倍生产化工产品，谈何容易。县委领导请来了中国科学院南京林产化学工业研究所副所长张宗和，还有研究员肖尊琰、徐进。张宗和被任命为工程副总指挥、总工程师。实际上，他承担了资源论证、工程设计、设备安装、技术指导等一揽子工作，连资金筹集和产品销售他都亲自过问。
    竹山县把建设林化厂作为脱贫致富的一个骨干项目，投入了大量的财力人力。对于这个年年吃国家财政补贴、人均收入只100多元的穷县来说，大家心里都明白：林化厂只能成功，不能失败。
    水泥、石灰、沙子，数千吨基建物资运往工地；厂房、仓库、道路，紧张地进入施工。张宗和像陀螺一样日夜不停地转动着，他和他带领的助手拚搏了9个月，终于在1985年12月27日单机一次试车成功。1000公斤单宁酸“呱呱”坠地，质量超过了国家标准。
    病床上的总指挥
    单宁酸单机试车成功后，患有胃萎缩、胆结石等疾病的张宗和住进了竹山医院。他躺在病榻上，每天左手在打吊针，右手还拿着图纸，同厂长、技术人员一起研究工作，人们称他是病床上的总指挥。
    不几天，厂里报告：干燥机鼓风效果不佳，关风机不能密封……张宗和再也躺不住了。他悄悄回到厂里，连夜开会研究措施。第二天，他不顾虚弱的病体，一头钻进温度达72摄氏度的浸提器里。当他把操作工错装的出液管和排水管矫正爬出来时，竟被单宁酸蒸馏水浸成了奇异的“蓝种人”。几个工人说，那样的地方张总都敢钻进去，我们真是自愧不如呵！
    数日后，一张刊有《病床总指挥》新闻照片的《湖北日报》送到南京，像一块沉重的铅石压到他的妻子心头。她万般焦急地挂通了南京至竹山县医院的长途电话，接话人告诉她，张宗和已转到郧阳地区人民医院确诊去了。电话挂到地区医院，当张宗和刚刚说出：“我是宗和……”送话器里便传来妻子悲伤的哭声。好一阵，妻子才抽泣着说：“我已给你联系好了医院，今晚就接你回南京！”
    “不！我回竹山治疗。”
    张宗和知道，如果自己一走，单宁酸生产线建设速度就要受到影响，靠贷款几百万元研究的设备，就难以如期调试和正常运转。
    两天后，妻子果然风尘仆仆来到竹山。见到妻子，张宗和能说什么呢？他长年呆在大巴山区，妻子又要上班，又要带孩子，还有沉重的家务……妻子的深情打动了丈夫，却未动摇丈夫的信念。妻子理解丈夫，第四天，她谢绝了厂里送她游览武当山的安排，匆匆踏上了归途。是呵，人世间哪有一种爱能比献身事业更炽烈，更深沉？
    1986年8月5日，一条在全国名列前茅的单宁酸生产线，继单机试车成功后，提前一年在竹山正式投产。
    为了大巴山区
    张宗和心里总惦记着一件事：我这个“客座总工程师”总归是要告辞的，我走了以后，厂子怎么办？张宗和提出，开办技工学校，培养当地技术工人和科研人才！经过两年多时间的努力，他和同伴们为厂里培训了70多名技术工人，还带领50多名工人到南京，沈阳等地学习新工艺、新技术……
    “单宁酸仅是单一产品，只有向系列化深加工发展，厂子才有更大的前途。”张宗和又连续设计出第二、第三、第四条生产线。投产后各种产品均畅销国内外。
    去年12月28日，竹山肚倍资源开发利用成果通过部级鉴定。林业部和中国林化学会等单位的20多名专家教授通过现场鉴定，认为此项目的技术水平处于国内领先地位，并已进入国际同行业先进行列，是我国林产化工领域的重大突破，它开辟了我国五倍子系列产品开发利用的新途径。
    竹山林化厂除了本身创造的效益外，还使全县种植肚倍的农民每年增加近700万元收入，其受益范围波及到周围各县。农民种植肚倍的积极性越来越高，近几年竹山新增倍林面积6.5万多亩，到1990年，全县倍林面积预计可达10万亩。肚倍的开发已成为大巴山区脱贫致富的骨干项目之一。
    有人认为，竹山肯定给了张宗和优厚的报酬。记者在采访中了解到，县委原决定每月给他200元补助，可是张宗和始终分文不要。每月除了南京林化所发给他应得的工资外，他没有额外的收入。
    去年，张宗和被评为湖北省特等劳动模范，全国优秀科技工作者，并获得全国“五一”劳动奖章。
