The textile industry has developed rapidly in the past ten years, with total output value increasing from 5.6 billion yuan to 12.83 billion yuan, a growth of 1.3 times. Exports have increased from $2.16 billion to $11.8 billion. In the world textile trade, China's position has risen from 11th to 5th. The quality of products has improved, with more varieties and colors, and some products have reached or are close to international standards.

Over the past ten years, nearly a thousand "three-in-one" enterprises have been established in the textile industry, utilizing $1.25 billion in foreign investment. Among these enterprises, two-thirds are joint ventures with Hong Kong. At today's symposium, leaders from the Ministry of Textile Industry emphasized that they will continue to open up and further expand the textile industry's foreign trade and economic and technological cooperation.

Hong Kong textile industry representatives who have actively cooperated with the mainland in recent years have set up textile and dyeing factories in the mainland, and some are investing billions of yuan to build "textile cities." They predicted and analyzed the development trends of the international textile and apparel market next year, believing that the mainland is the region with the most development opportunities in the Asian textile industry. They pointed out that the most important issue for mainland textile products in the international market is product quality, noting that the quality of textile products exported to Hong Kong from the mainland has declined in recent years. They hope that the mainland will start by improving people's quality to enhance product quality.

Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch Director Xu Jia Tun attended the meeting and spoke.

　　扩大合作　发展贸易
　　内地香港纺织界举行座谈
    本报香港11月28日电　记者连锦添、莫新元报道：纺织工业部部长吴文英今天对香港的20多位纺织界人士强调：内地与香港在纺织方面各有优势，要进一步加强经济合作和贸易往来，发挥综合优势，共同对付国际市场的竞争。她是在深圳与香港纺织业人士座谈时讲这番话的。
    改革十年来，我国纺织工业发展很快，总产值从560亿元增加到1283亿元，增长1.3倍。出口由21.6亿美元，增加到118亿美元。在世界纺织品贸易额中的位置由第11位上升到第5位。产品的档次有了改进，花色品种增加，部分产品接近或达到国际同类水平。
    十年来，纺织工业已开办了近千家“三资”企业，共利用外资12.5亿美元。在这些企业中，与香港合资的占2／3。在今天的座谈会上，纺织工业部的领导强调，将坚持对外开放，进一步扩大纺织工业的外贸和经济技术合作。
    参加座谈会的香港纺织界人士，近年来积极与内地开展经济合作和贸易往来的，不少人已在内地设纺织、印染厂，有的正投资数亿元兴建“纺织城”。他们预测分析了明年国际纺织、服装市场发展趋势，认为中国内地是亚洲纺织业中最有发展机会的地区。他们认为，目前中国内地纺织品在国际市场上最重要的问题是产品质量，指出近年来内地出口到香港的纺织品质量有所下降，希望内地从提高人的素质入手，提高产品质量。
