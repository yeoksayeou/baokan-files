    Beijing Municipal Leaders Participate in Labor at the Asian Games Construction Site

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 5th

    Reporter Liu Xiaoming reports: This morning around 9 AM, several large buses and vans entered the northern suburbs Olympic Center. Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong and nearly 200 leaders from the Beijing Municipal Government and the Asian Games Organizing Committee used their Sunday off to participate in labor at the Asian Games construction site.

    In the chilly weather, the leaders picked up shovels and started working as soon as they got off the vehicles. The task assigned to them was to lay the base soil for the grass outside the track and field stadium. Among these leaders were Municipal Committee Deputy Secretary Wang Guang, Vice Mayors Zhang Baifa, Lu Yucheng, and Wu Yi. The oldest participant was 86-year-old Municipal Political Consultative Conference Vice Chairman Xia Zhan, and the youngest was a 34-year-old deputy secretary of the Municipal Youth League Committee.

    During a break from the labor, Chen Xitong, while drinking water, said that successfully hosting the Asian Games is beneficial for boosting national spirit, enhancing the country's image, and promoting the work of various industries in Beijing. He hoped to strengthen the promotion of the Asian Games so that all citizens of Beijing would care about it. Chen Xitong also mentioned that organizing officials and youth to participate in voluntary labor has been a fine tradition of our party, but this tradition has not been upheld in recent years. A weak labor ethic is not conducive to our carrying forward the spirit of hard work and self-reliance. This aspect needs to be strengthened in the future, and at least the cleanliness of classrooms and dormitories should be ensured for young students.

    At the same time these leaders were working, across the road from the northern suburbs track and field stadium, more than 2,000 university students from 12 higher education institutions in Beijing were also participating in voluntary labor at the Asian Games Village construction site. Chen Xitong enthusiastically praised the students' actions.

    北京市领导到亚运会工地劳动
    本报北京11月5日讯　记者刘小明报道：今天上午9时左右，几辆大客车、面包车开进北郊奥林匹克中心，北京市市长陈希同和北京市及亚运会组委会近200名领导干部利用星期日休息时间，到亚运会工地劳动。
    在阴冷的天气中，领导干部下车后抄起铁锹就干起来，分配给他们的任务是为田径场外的草坪垫底土。这些领导干部中还包括市委副书记汪家镠、王光、副市长张百发、陆宇澄、吴仪。参加劳动的人中年龄最大的是86岁的市政协副主席夏翔，最小的是34岁的一位团市委副书记。
    劳动中间休息时，陈希同边喝水边说，开好亚运会对于振奋民族精神，树立国家的形象，促进北京市各行各业的工作等都有好处。他希望加强对亚运会的宣传，使全市人民都关心亚运会。陈希同还谈到，经常组织干部和青少年参加义务劳动，本来是我们党的一项优良传统，前几年这个传统不怎么坚持了。劳动观念淡薄，不利于我们发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，今后这方面要加强，青少年学生至少要把教室、宿舍卫生搞好。
    在这些领导者劳动的同时，与北郊田径场只一路之隔的亚运村工地内，北京12所高等院校的2000多名大学生也在参加义务劳动。陈希同热情地称赞了大学生的这种行为。
