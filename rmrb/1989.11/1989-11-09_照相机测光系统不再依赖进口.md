    Camera metering systems no longer rely on imports

    Xinhua News Agency reports: The metering systems of the Jin Du S207I and Ming Jia S207M cameras produced by Sichuan Jin Guang Instrument Factory and Ming Guang Instrument Factory have recently passed the ministry-level appraisal. The internal metering systems of these two cameras use domestically produced electronic components and have the advantages of a wide metering range, high precision, reliable performance, and low cost. Their emergence has changed the situation where China's camera metering systems rely on imports, achieving full domestic production of the entire machine.
