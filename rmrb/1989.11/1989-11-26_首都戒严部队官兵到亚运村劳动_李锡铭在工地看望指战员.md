More than 4,000 officers and soldiers of the capital's martial law troops, carrying banners that read "Strive for Glory for the Motherland, Strive for Honor for the Military Flag," participated in voluntary labor at the Asian Games Village construction site today.

The martial law troops' labor section is on the northern side of the North Gardens Road in the Asian Games Village. The area is littered with garbage and debris, and the drainage ditches are in disrepair, making the cleanup task extremely arduous. As soon as the generals and soldiers arrived at the site, they eagerly began digging ditches, compacting soil, draining sewage, and removing debris. Some even jumped into the cold water ditches to get the job done. Zhang Zhen, a driver from a certain regiment, known as the "Guardians of the Republic," shoveled soil while encouraging his comrades: "The opportunity to sweat for the Asian Games Village is rare; let's give it our all!" The "Red Army Regiment" of a certain unit competed with brother units in progress, quality, and safety, with labor songs echoing across the site. The soldiers worked with great enthusiasm, drawing praise from passersby: "Truly worthy of being the People's Liberation Army."

The martial law troops will continue to participate in five days of voluntary labor. Li Ximing, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee, visited the site to express his respect to the officers and soldiers on behalf of all the people of Beijing.

　　首都戒严部队官兵到亚运村劳动
　　李锡铭在工地看望指战员
    新华社北京11月25日电　（记者程光龙）首都戒严部队4000多名官兵，今天打着“为祖国争光、为军旗争辉”等横幅，到亚运村工地参加义务劳动。
    戒严部队的劳动地段在亚运村东侧北苑路上。那里垃圾、渣土遍地，排水沟年久失修，整治任务十分艰巨。从将军到士兵一到工地，便争先恐后地挖沟、夯土、排污水、运渣滓，有的还跳进冰凉的水沟里干起来。“共和国卫士”、某团汽车驾驶员张震一边铲土，一边鼓励身旁的战友：“能把汗水洒在亚运村工地上，机会太难得了，大家加油啊！”某部“红军团”与兄弟部队开展了比进度、比质量、比安全的劳动竞赛，工地上劳动号子此起彼伏，战士们干得热火朝天，引得过往群众不住地赞叹“真不愧是解放军。”
    戒严部队将连续参加5天义务劳动。中共中央政治局委员、北京市委书记李锡铭在工地看望指战员时，代表全市人民向指战员们致敬。
