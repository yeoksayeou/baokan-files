    世界杯羽毛球赛结束
    我国选手获男单女双两项冠军
    本报广州11月19日电　记者黄振中报道：历时5天的世界杯羽毛球赛今天在这里落幕。中国选手杨阳获男单冠军。印尼选手王莲香获女单冠军。我国林瑛、关渭贞获女双冠军。南朝鲜朴柱奉、金文秀获男双冠军。混双第一名是南朝鲜的朴柱奉、郑明熙。
    男单决赛在杨阳和马来西亚的傅国强之间展开。第一局杨阳久攻不克，同对手打成14平，加分再战才以17∶14拿下第一局。第二局杨阳打得顺手，以15∶6的悬殊比分取胜。我国选手韩爱平未发挥出水平，以5∶11、4∶11连丢两局，输给王莲香，获亚军。这是王莲香在世界大赛上第一次战胜韩爱平。
    女双决赛扣人心弦，林瑛、关渭贞以15∶2先胜南朝鲜名将黄惠英、郑素英一局。第二局风云突变，对手比分几度领先，几乎是压着打。当记分牌显示出9∶14时，观众紧张得为我国两位姑娘冒汗，以为无力回天。林瑛、关渭贞毕竟是久经沙场的老将，一分一分地追，直追到14平，最后以17∶15击败了这一对好手，为我国再添一枚金牌。
    男双决赛是本次大赛的压轴戏，由我国选手李永波、田秉毅同南朝鲜朴柱奉、金文秀交锋。南朝鲜选手实力强，且发挥出色，以2∶0获胜。李永波、田秉毅获亚军。
