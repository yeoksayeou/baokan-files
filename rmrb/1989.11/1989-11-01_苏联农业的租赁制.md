Over the past two years, the Soviet Union's agricultural reforms have been transitioning from the contract system to the leasing system. The leasing system has shown noticeable success in some regions. The March Central Committee Plenum of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) affirmed the basic direction of agricultural reforms and decided to gradually promote the leasing system nationwide to replace the irrational agricultural administrative management system.

Soviet publications believe that the leasing system has developed on the basis of collective and family contracts. According to Soviet publications, the biggest difference between the leasing system and the contract system is that lessees have complete operational autonomy and property responsibility, making them the true owners of the land and other means of production. According to this policy, farmers can lease land, livestock, farm machinery, etc., with the lease period extending up to 50 years. After signing the lease agreement, farmers only need to pay the lease fee, and their production activities are free from any administrative interference. The lease fee can take various forms, including paying a fixed tax rate in cash or equivalent goods, or through contract prices (the leasing unit purchases the lessee's products at a contract price lower than the state price, with the difference being the rent).

Oryol Oblast is one of the regions that implemented the leasing system earlier. Lessees include individuals, groups of people, and most commonly, families. This new mode of production has attracted many urban residents, some of whom have even moved to rural areas to start family farms, a phenomenon that has never occurred before.

According to recent predictions, the region's agricultural production will significantly increase this year, with meat production alone expected to rise by 10,000 tons compared to last year, and milk production is projected to grow by 10% to 15%.

The Upper Volga Collective Farm in the region has 34 lessees and 14 farm machinery operators. The management structure consists of 14 people. The farm sells seeds, feed, fuel, lubricants, and other items to lessees at internal planning prices and then purchases agricultural products from them at contract prices based on quality.

Since the farm implemented the leasing system, a notable change is that all lessees are very mindful of saving resources. In 1988, the farm's truck and tractor drivers' lease income was higher than in 1987, while the farm's total expenditure on farm machinery was only half of what it was in 1987. Additionally, the cost per 100 kilograms of pork dropped from 390 rubles to 200 rubles, and the cost per 100 kilograms of milk decreased from 34.5 rubles to 24 rubles. The farm's total production input profit rate increased by 26 percentage points compared to 1987, and labor productivity improved by 25%, exceeding the growth in per capita income for the entire village. This means that the leasing system benefits both individuals and the state.

The leasing system has also achieved good results in other regions. For example, some villages in the Caucasus region have transitioned from labor shortages to labor surpluses after implementing the leasing system. These surplus laborers have started processing industries, changing the production structure of these villages. The Altai region, which had abandoned several farms due to incorrect agricultural policies, has seen many city residents start family farms since last year, leading to an "agricultural revival" movement.

Of course, some problems have arisen during the implementation of the leasing system. For instance, many of the contracts signed so far have terms of only 1-3 years, far below the maximum lease period allowed by the state. The CPSU Central Committee's *Economic Weekly* believes this reflects farmers' doubts about the stability of the leasing policy, and some management departments are also hesitant to fully implement it, fearing potential issues. Additionally, some farms and agricultural enterprises have not created necessary conditions for lessees in terms of funding, product sales, applying new agricultural research findings, and protecting legal rights, making it difficult to implement the leasing system in those areas. Some lessees from the city have left after a short period. Some Soviet publications, when reporting this phenomenon, pointed out that not interfering with lessees' production does not mean neglecting them.

It seems that such a profound agricultural reform will inevitably encounter various problems, as Gorbachev said at the March Plenum, "Solving these tasks will require enormous efforts from the entire party and the people."

    苏联农业的租赁制
    胡锡进
    最近两年，苏联农业改革正在经历从承包制到租赁制的逐渐过渡，租赁制在一些地区的试行取得明显成绩。今年3月召开的苏共中央全会肯定了农业改革的基本方向，决定在全国范围内逐步推广租赁制，以取代不合理的农业行政管理体制。
    苏联报刊认为，租赁制是在集体承包和家庭承包的基础上发展起来的。据苏联报刊报道，它与承包制的最大区别是承租者有完全的经营自主权和财产责任，是土地和其它生产资料的真正主人。根据这个政策，农民可以租赁土地、牲畜、农机等，租期最长可达50年。在签订租赁合同后，农民只需交纳租赁费，生产活动不受任何行政干预。租赁费的形式可以多样，除按固定税率交付现金或折合实物外，还可通过合同价格（出租单位用合同规定的低价购买承租人的产品，合同价格与国家牌价之差就是租金）加以实现。
    奥廖尔州是推行租赁制较早的地区。承租者既有个人，也有人数较多的集体，但最多的是以家庭为承租单位。新的生产方式吸引了许多城市居民，有的甚至举家迁往农村，办起家庭农场，这种现象过去从未有过。
    根据不久前的预测，该州的农业生产今年将大幅度提高，仅肉类就比去年增加1万吨，牛奶产量也将增长10％—15％。
    该州上沃里沙集体农庄有34个租赁户，14名农用机械承租人员，管理机构由14人组成。农庄按照内部计划——核算价格向承租者出售种子、饲料、燃料、润滑油等，然后再根据质量，按照合同规定的相应结算价格收购农产品。
    自农庄实行租赁制以来，一个突出的变化是所有承租者都十分注意节约。
    1988年农庄汽车、拖拉机司机的租赁收入高于1987年，而农庄用于农机的总支出却只有1987年的一半。此外，每百公斤猪肉的成本从390卢布降到200卢布，每百公斤牛奶的成本从34.5卢布降到24卢布。农庄生产总投入的利润率比1987年多了26个百分点，劳动生产率提高25％，且超过了全村人均收入的增长。这意味着租赁制使个人和国家都得到了好处。
    租赁制在其它地区也取得了良好效果。如高加索地区的一些村庄在实行租赁制以后由劳动力不足变为劳动力剩余。这些剩余劳力办起加工业，改变了这些村庄的生产结构。阿尔泰地区曾因错误的农业政策荒弃了一批农庄，自去年起许多城里人来到这里办起家庭农场，形成了“农业复兴”运动。
    当然，在推行租赁制的过程中也出现一些问题。如现已签订的许多合同期限只有1—3年，大大低于国家允许的租赁期限。苏共中央主办的《经济周报》认为，这反映了农民对租赁制政策的稳定性尚存疑虑，一些管理机关也放不开手脚，怕出问题。此外，由于一些农庄农场没有在资金、产品销售、应用农业科研新成果、维护合法权益等方面为承租人创造必要的条件，致使那里的租赁制难以贯彻。一些从城里来的承租人干了一阵又跑了回去。苏联一些报刊在报道这种现象时指出，不干涉承租人的生产不等于对他们放任不管。
    看来，如此深刻的农业改革必然还会碰到这样那样的问题，这正如戈尔巴乔夫在3月全会上所说的那样，“解决这些任务还要求全党和全体人民付出巨大的努力。”
