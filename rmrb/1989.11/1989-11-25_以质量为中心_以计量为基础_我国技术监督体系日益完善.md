	Quality-Centered, Metrology-Based: China's Technical Supervision System Becomes More Perfect

	BEIJING, Nov. 24 (Xinhua) -- Reporter Zhu Jianhong learned from the first national technical supervision work conference held today in Beijing that China has established a standardization system in various fields of the economy and social life, formed a relatively complete metrology legal system and a value transmission network, and initially established a national quality supervision network. Technical supervision plays an increasingly important role in economic construction and social development.

	China's technical supervision work mainly includes the supervision and management of standards, metrology, and quality. Since the reform and opening up, these three aspects have made significant progress.

	--- By the end of September this year, the total number of national standards had reached 158,250, of which 141,250 were added or revised in the past ten years, more than eight times the total number of standards formulated or revised before 1978. By the end of 1988, 38.1 percent of national standards adopted international or foreign advanced standards, and another batch reached or approached the international level. The two combined accounted for about 60 percent of the total number of national standards. The promulgation of the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Standardization" marked the standardization work entering the track of legal management.

	--- China has established 138 national standards and more than 80,000 various levels of social public and enterprise, institution highest metrology standards in ten major categories of length, temperature, mechanics, electromagnetism, optics, acoustics, chemistry, radio, time frequency, and ionizing radiation, ensuring the unity of values nationwide. Since the implementation of the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Metrology" in 1986, 21 national metrology regulations and 631 national metrology inspection procedures have been formulated.

	--- Quality supervision and management work has been significantly strengthened. Quality supervision and inspection institutions have developed significantly, initially forming a multi-level national quality supervision network.

	State Councilor Song Jian, Standing Committee Member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Zhang Jingfu, and leaders such as Lü Dong and Yuan Baohua attended today's meeting.

　　以质量为中心　以计量为基础
　　我国技术监督体系日益完善
    本报北京十一月二十四日讯　记者朱剑红从今天在此间召开的第一次全国技术监督工作会议获悉：目前我国已在经济和社会生活各领域建立标准化体系，形成较为完整的计量法规体系和量值传递网，初步建立了全国质量监督网。技术监督在经济建设和社会发展中起着越来越重要的作用。
    我国技术监督工作主要包括标准、计量及质量的监督和管理。改革开放以来，这三方面的工作有了突飞猛进的发展。
    ——到今年九月底，国家标准总数已达一点五八二五万个，其中近十年增加了一点四一二五万个，是一九七八年以前制修订标准总数的八倍多。截至一九八八年底，国家标准中，采用国际标准和国外先进标准的为百分之三十八点一，还有一批达到或接近国际水平，两者合计约占国家标准总数的百分之六十。《中华人民共和国标准化法》的颁布，标志着我国标准化工作走上了法制管理的轨道。
    ——我国已建立了长度、温度、力学、电磁、光学、声学、化学、无线电、时间频率、电离辐射十大类计量专业的一百三十八种国家基准和八万余个各级各类社会公用和企、事业最高计量标准，保证了全国的量值统一。一九八六年实施《中华人民共和国计量法》以来，又先后制定了二十一个全国性计量法规和六百三十一个国家计量检定规程。
    ——质量监督管理工作显著加强。质量监督管理机构和检验机构有了较大发展，初步形成了多层次的覆盖全国的质量监督网。
    国务委员宋健、中顾委常委张劲夫及吕东、袁宝华等领导同志出席了今天的会议。
