In recent years, with the rapid development of agricultural production and the increasing grain yield in rural areas, farmers have more and more grain stored at home. However, many farmers lack the knowledge of grain storage, which not only makes the grain prone to dampness and mildew but also vulnerable to damage by poultry and rats, resulting in unnecessary losses.

The county's grain bureau, in response to this situation, decided to launch a comprehensive grain storage service for the people this year. Farmers can store their surplus grain in nearby grain depots. Any grain that meets certain conditions can be freely stored, regardless of the duration. There will be no deductions for losses or any fees charged. The grain depot will immediately issue a grain storage certificate to the storing farmer. The farmer can withdraw the grain at any time by presenting the certificate, taking as much or as little as needed, until the entire amount is withdrawn.

Since the "grain bank" opened, farmers have been flocking to store their grain. From the wheat harvest to July 25th, the grain depots and grain stores have stored 3,310,000 kilograms of grain for the farmers. In Xinji Township alone, 200,000 kilograms of wheat have been stored for the people. Many farmers joyfully said, "The grain department has done a great favor for us. We no longer have to worry about grain storage."

　　代民贮粮　利国利民
　　鹿邑开办23家“粮食银行”
    近年来，随着农业生产的飞速发展，农村粮食产量的逐年提高，农民家中的存粮越来越多。由于许多农民不懂贮粮技术，既容易使粮食受潮发生霉变，还会被家禽、老鼠糟蹋，造成不必要的损失。
    我县粮食局针对这一情况，决定今年在全县范围内广泛开展代民贮粮工作，农民可把多余的粮食贮存在附近粮管所，凡符合一定条件的粮食均可自由贮存，不论存放多长时间，一律不扣损耗，不收任何费用。粮管所对贮粮农户当即发给一本贮粮证，农户何时需要，可随时凭证到粮管所支取，取多取少听便，直到付清为止。
      “粮食银行”开业以来，前往贮粮的农民络绎不绝，从麦收到七月二十五日，粮管所、粮店已为农民代贮粮食三百三十一万公斤，仅辛集一个乡就为群众代贮小麦二十万公斤。不少农民高兴地说：“粮食部门为我们办了一件大好事，我们再也不用为贮粮犯愁了。”
