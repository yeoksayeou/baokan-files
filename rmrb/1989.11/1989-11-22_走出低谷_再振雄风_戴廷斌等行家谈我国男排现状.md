The recent national men's volleyball league held in Yangzhou was a cause for concern. The competition was lackluster, with few exciting moments. Several matches saw retired players returning to the court, while newcomers seemed inexperienced and lacked solid fundamentals. There were numerous mistakes in serving and spiking...

This was the assessment of former Chinese men's volleyball coach Dai Tingbin. He and other volleyball experts, including Wang Zuhong, the main attacker of China's first-generation men's volleyball team, and Ji Erxiang, former coach of Jiangsu men's volleyball team, share similar views on this issue.

China's men's volleyball team has had two glorious periods. The first was in the mid-1960s when the team's level was close to the world standard. The second was in the early 1980s when the team placed in the top five in two major international competitions. However, starting in 1983, the team began to decline, with no significant developments or innovations in tactics or technical skills. This year, at the Asian Championships in Seoul, the Chinese team lost to South Korea and Japan, narrowly defeating Pakistan, a team they had previously dominated. Recently, they even lost to India.

In the past, during major volleyball tournaments, fans from all over the country would send letters of encouragement and support to the Sports Commission, urging the athletes to bring honor to the nation. This time, however, only a few letters were received. It is evident that the number of domestic volleyball fans is decreasing, and people's interest in men's volleyball is waning.

Why has China's men's volleyball team been stuck in a slump? Several experts agree that cultivating athletes in diving, gymnastics, and other individual sports can yield multiple gold medals in a single competition. Volleyball, however, is a team sport, and even at its best, only one gold medal can be won. Therefore, some regions in China have neglected investment and development in volleyball. Provinces like Anhui and Jiangxi have disbanded their men's volleyball teams, and places like Jiangsu and Zhejiang are considering doing the same due to financial and personnel constraints. If this trend continues, China's men's volleyball team faces the risk of generational disruption.

Currently, China's men's volleyball team lacks top-tier players like Wang Jiawei and Shen Fulin, making it difficult to improve overall performance. In the past, when the Japanese national team visited China, our national team did not even need to compete; the top few teams in the national first-tier league could easily defeat them. Now, even qualifying for the top three in the Asian Games is a challenge.

Due to years of lax training and management, the current level of training is far from the rigor of the past. Take this year's national first-tier league, for example: the teams that won the gold and silver medals in the 1987 National Games, such as the PLA team, Beijing team, and the fourth-place Jiangsu team, none of them made it to the top eight. Moreover, the matches were played half-heartedly, with little competition and poor sportsmanship. Losing a match would often lead to outbursts of anger.

Frequent team adjustments also make it difficult to develop a distinctive style. The national team has had three different head coaches from 1984 to 1988 and undergone two major overhauls. Although the team's average height of 1.95 meters gives them an absolute advantage in Asia (South Korea's average height is 1.907 meters, and Japan's is 1.91 meters), they still rank in the middle to lower tier in the world. They lack technical skills, strength, and quality, and their tactics are heavily focused on attacking while neglecting defense. Therefore, China's men's volleyball team remains a team that is incomplete and not strong.

Dai Tingbin and others believe that to quickly break out of the current situation and emerge from the slump, China's men's volleyball team must implement a practical training plan and intensify training to have a chance of developing in the highly competitive world of volleyball.

It is reported that the current situation of men's volleyball has attracted the attention of relevant authorities, who are studying measures to revitalize the sport. In early December, a winter training camp will be organized, bringing together the best first-tier teams and the national team for intensive training and competition. People hope that China's men's volleyball team will achieve good results in next year's Asian Games.

### 走出低谷　再振雄风——戴廷斌等行家谈我国男排现状

　　走出低谷　再振雄风
　　——戴廷斌等行家谈我国男排现状
      “今年全国男排甲级联赛打的水平实在让人担忧，竞争气氛不浓，精彩场面很少。好几个赛场，退役的老队员重又顶岗，新手显得太嫩，基本功不扎实，发球、扣球的失误太多……”这是前中国男排教练戴廷斌对最近在扬州举行的全国男排甲级联赛的总评价。他和我国第一代男排主攻手王祖洪、江苏男排前主教练计尔煊等几位排球专家在这个问题上有一致的看法。
    我国男排曾有过两个辉煌时期。一是60年代中期，我国男排的水平已接近世界水平；二是在80年代初，男排健儿在两次世界大赛上跃身前五名。1983年开始出现滑坡，从战术到技术水平，都没有发展和创新。今年汉城亚洲锦标赛，中国队输给了南朝鲜和日本队，险胜曾当“小菜”吃的巴基斯坦队。前不久，竟输给印度队。
    以前一场排球大赛，全国各地球迷关心、鼓励，慰问信纷纷飞向体委，激励运动员为国争光。这次亚洲锦标赛，只零零星星地收到几封信。可见，国内排球观众正在减少，人们对男排的关注在淡漠。
    中国男排一直在低谷中徘徊，原因究竟在哪里？
    几位专家一致认为：培养一个跳水、技巧、体操等项目的运动员，可能一次就得几块金牌，而排球是个集体项目，一次最好也只能拿到一块金牌。所以，现在国内有些地方忽视排球的投资和发展。安徽、江西等省已取消了男排队，江苏、浙江等地也由于经费和编制的原因，准备取消青年队。这样下去，中国男排将有断代危险。
    目前，中国男排缺少像汪嘉伟、沈富麟那样的尖子队员，整体水平很难提高。过去日本队访华，我们的国家队都不需要出场，全国甲级队前几名都能“吃”掉对手，而现在我们想在亚运会上进前3名，都已很吃紧了。
    由于多年来放松教育和管理，训练远不如过去刻苦。就拿这次全国甲级联赛来说，曾获1987年第六届全运会冠、亚军的八一队和北京队以及第4名江苏队，没有一个打进8强。而且，比赛打得松松垮垮，竞争不激烈，作风也太差，一输球就气急败坏。
    队伍的频繁调整，也很难形成自己的特色。国家队从1984年到1988年已换了3个主教练，队伍进行了两次大调整，尽管平均身高达1.95米，在亚洲占绝对优势（南朝鲜队平均高度1.907米，日本队也只有1.91米），但在世界排坛仍处于中下水平。技术、力量、素质等方面不如人家，战术上又是重攻轻防。因此，中国男排仍是一支不全、不强的队伍。
    戴廷斌等人认为，中国男排要尽快摆脱现状，走出低谷，必须制定一套切实可行的训练方案，强化训练，才有可能在强手如林的世界排坛夹缝中求得发展。
    据悉，男排现状已引起了有关方面重视，研究制定了振兴男排的措施。12月初将组织一次冬训，把全国优秀甲级队同国家队集中到一起，强化训练，形成竞争。人们期望中国男排能在明年亚运会上打出好成绩。
