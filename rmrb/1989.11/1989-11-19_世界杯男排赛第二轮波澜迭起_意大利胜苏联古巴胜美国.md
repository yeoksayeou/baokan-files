People's Daily, Tokyo, November 18th - Reporter Yu Qing: The second round of the World Cup men's volleyball tournament saw unexpected results, making the overall situation more complicated. Today's four matches all ended with a 3:0 score. The results were: Italy defeated the Soviet Union (15:8, 15:12, 15:7), Cuba defeated the United States (15:8, 15:12, 15:11), Brazil defeated South Korea (15:3, 15:5, 15:8), and Japan defeated Cameroon (15:4, 15:2, 15:1). The dominance of the United States and the Soviet Union in world men's volleyball was shattered today.

The result of the Soviet Union being defeated by Italy in straight sets was unexpected, and people began to doubt whether the Soviet team, which had won 3:2 against the U.S. team yesterday, could win the championship. This year's European Championship winner, the Italian team, with an average height of 1.97 meters and a center of 2.02 meters, Zorzi, has excellent attacking and blocking skills. The score was always leading, and they easily won the three sets.

The Cuban team's 3:0 victory over the Olympic champion U.S. team also showed their strength. People look forward to the match between Italy and Cuba tomorrow to get an initial conclusion on who has the hope of winning the championship.

    世界杯男排赛第二轮波澜迭起
    意大利胜苏联古巴胜美国
    本报东京11月18日电　记者于青报道：世界杯男排赛第二轮比赛爆出冷门，使整个比赛形势变得复杂起来。今天四场比赛都以3∶0结束，结果是意大利胜苏联（15∶8、15∶12、15∶7），古巴胜美国
  （15∶8、15∶12、15∶11），巴西胜南朝鲜（15∶3、15∶5、15∶8），日本胜喀麦隆（15∶4、15∶2、15∶1）。世界男排美苏称霸的局面今天被打破。
    苏联被意大利直落三局击败的结果出人意外，人们对昨天以3∶2战胜美国队的苏联队能否夺杯开始持怀疑态度。今年欧洲锦标赛冠军意大利队，平均身高1.97米，以2.02米的佐尔基为中心，强攻拦网都十分出色，比分始终领先，顺利地拿下三局。
    古巴队以3∶0战胜奥运会冠军美国队，其实力也令人刮目相看。人们期待通过明天意大利和古巴队的比赛，得出谁有希望夺取冠军的初步结论。
