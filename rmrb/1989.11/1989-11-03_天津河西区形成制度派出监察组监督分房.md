	Hebei District in Tianjin has increased the transparency of its housing allocation work, established monitoring groups for supervision, and eliminated the phenomenon of "pulling strings" to ensure that housing allocation is fair and reasonable.

	In recent years, Hebei District has made significant progress in its courtyard renovation project, with over 10,000 households moving into new homes. During the housing allocation process, the district has insisted on making the allocation standards, results, and pre-allocation agreements "three public." To prevent "ordinary" citizens from being disadvantaged in the housing allocation process, in June of this year, the district sent monitoring groups to supervise the allocation of housing in the Nanlouwo section. They abolished 120 "favor letters," resolved 24 unreasonable issues, and resisted 50 instances of improper conduct such as gift-giving and banqueting, which was welcomed by the public.

	To ensure that this effective measure is sustained, in July of this year, the district issued a decision titled "On Establishing the System of Sending Monitoring Groups to Supervise Housing Allocation." This system stipulates that for future new housing allocations, the district government will send monitoring groups composed of district supervision bureau officials, district construction commission supervision personnel, and relevant street community anti-corruption supervisors. These groups will review the housing allocation plans and results, handle public letters and visits, investigate and deal with corrupt officials, and participate in housing allocation group meetings.

	Recently, the district's Xinanlou 15th section residential buildings began the housing allocation process. The monitoring group sent by the district government, based on public opinions, proposed suggestions regarding issues such as the original allocation agreement and inconsistencies in the statistics of illegal standards. All suggestions were adopted by the allocation group, and they helped the allocation group return over 100 "favor letters." During the allocation process, no collective petitioning incidents occurred, and no allocation personnel were found to have shown favoritism. This ensured that the housing allocation work, which usually takes two months to complete, was finished smoothly in half a month.

    天津河西区形成制度派出监察组监督分房
    新华社天津11月2日电　（通讯员岩音）天津市河西区增加分配住房工作的透明度，成立监察小组进行监督，杜绝“走后门”现象，确保房屋分配公正合理。
    近几年，河西区平房改造工作进展较快，先后有1万余户居民搬入新居。在分房过程中，这个区坚持做到分房标准、分房结果和分房前协议“三公开”。为不让“无门无路”的群众在分房中吃亏，今年6月份这个区在分配南楼窝铺地段住房时，派监察小组监督，废除“人情条子”120余张，解决不合理问题24个，抵制请客送礼等不正之风50起，受到群众的欢迎。
    为使这一行之有效的措施长期坚持下去，今年7月这个区又专门作出了《关于建立派监察组监督分房制度》的决定，这项制度规定，凡以后新房分配，区政府都要派由区监察局、区建委监察干部和有关街道群众廉政监督员组成的分房监察组，对分房方案和结果进行审核，接待群众来信来访和举报；查处不廉洁的干部；参加分房小组的会议。
    最近，这个区的西南楼15段居民楼开始分房，区政府派出的监察组，根据群众意见，对原分房协议、违章标准统计不一等问题提出了建议，全部被分房小组采纳，并帮助分房小组退回“人情条子”100余张。在分配过程中，没有出现集体上访事件，未发现工作人员有优亲厚友行为，使一般需用两个月才能完成的分房工作，在半个月之内顺利完成。
