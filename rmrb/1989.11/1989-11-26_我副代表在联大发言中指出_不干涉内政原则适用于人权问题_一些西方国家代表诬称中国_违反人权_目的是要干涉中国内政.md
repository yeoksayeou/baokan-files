Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, November 24th. (Reporter: Sū Yuánchūn) China's Deputy Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Ding Yuangong, today spoke at the United Nations General Assembly's Social, Human Rights, and Cultural Committee. He emphasized that the principle of non-interference in internal affairs also applies to human rights issues.

Ding Yuangong stated that according to the 1965 United Nations Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of Their Independence and Sovereignty and the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, no state shall interfere directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other state. Any state shall refrain from organizing, assisting, fomenting, supporting, financing, inciting, or tolerating subversive, terrorist, or armed activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of another state, or interfering in civil strife in another state.

Ding Yuangong pointed out that some individuals, under the pretext of caring about human rights, criticize other countries' political systems and ideologies, and use incidents that displease them as excuses to pressure, sanction, and blockade other countries, attempting to force them to comply. They even openly support anti-government forces and wanted criminals in other countries, engaging in activities to defame and overthrow those governments. Such actions not only go against the United Nations' mission to uphold human rights but also are a blatant violation of international norms.

He said that the United Nations can provide a platform for international cooperation in the field of human rights, allowing countries to exchange, collaborate, and discuss issues of common concern. However, it has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of member states. Experience has shown that only mutual respect, understanding, and promotion are the correct paths to achieving human rights. Those who do not respect the sovereignty of other countries, arbitrarily interfere in their internal affairs, and frequently resort to pressure and imposition are obstructing normal dialogue and exchange, hindering understanding and cooperation, and are not conducive to the universal realization of human rights.

Ding Yuangong stated that the Chinese Constitution and laws guarantee the extensive rights of all ethnic groups, including the various rights of individual citizens. This is a concrete manifestation of China's commitment to human rights. China values tangible human rights. China is the world's largest developing country with 1.1 billion people but very little arable land. For the Chinese people, being able to eat and dress adequately and not contracting infectious diseases is more important than empty talk about human rights slogans.

Ding Yuangong also mentioned that in the past few days, representatives from several Western countries have accused China of "suppressing democratic movements" and "violating human rights" in their speeches. Their purpose is to find excuses to interfere in China's internal affairs. The fact is that certain Western powers have deeply interfered in China's internal affairs, supporting and fostering anti-Chinese government forces, engaging in subversive activities, and attempting to change China's socialist system. It is these countries that have seriously violated the basic norms of international relations and the basic principles of the United Nations Charter, and have grossly infringed upon China's sovereignty. Therefore, it is these countries, not China, that should be condemned.

He said that from the Opium War to the Eight-Nation Alliance and the Eight Years' War of Resistance against Japan, nearly a century of Chinese history has taught the Chinese people that if a country loses its sovereignty, there will be no human rights. On this land of China, to uphold human rights, we must not allow any Western forces to once again ride roughshod over the Chinese people.

Ambassador Ding Yuangong stated that in today's world, phenomena such as racism, colonialism, hegemony, foreign aggression, occupation, and interference still exist on a large scale, which are serious violations of human rights. If these phenomena are not eliminated, the universal realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms will remain an empty promise.

    我副代表在联大发言中指出
    不干涉内政原则适用于人权问题
　　一些西方国家代表诬称中国“违反人权”目的是要干涉中国内政
    新华社联合国11月24日电　（记者苏元椿）中国常驻联合国副代表丁原洪大使今天在联合国大会社会、人权和文化委员会发言中指出，不干涉别国内政的原则同样适用于人权问题。
    丁原洪说，根据联合国1965年的《不干涉内政宣言》和1970年的《国际法原则宣言》规定，任何国家都不得以任何形式剥夺或阻挠其他国家行使选择和实行其政治、经济、社会及文化制度的权利，不得以任何理由直接或间接干涉任何其它国家的内政、外交。
    丁原洪指出，有些人以关心人权为借口，对别国的政治制度、意识形态横加指责，以别国发生了令他们不悦的事情为由，对其施加压力，进行“制裁”和“封锁”，企图迫其就范，甚至公然支持别国的反政府力量和通缉的罪犯，从事诋毁和颠覆该国政府的活动。如此种种，不仅与联合国维护人权的宗旨背道而驰，而且也是对国际关系准则的粗暴践踏。
    他说，联合国可以为人权领域的国际合作提供一个场所，使各国可以就共同关心的问题进行交流、协作和商讨。但它无权对成员国国内管辖之事项横加干涉。事实证明，只有相互尊重、相互谅解、相互促进，才是实现人权的唯一正确途径。那种不尊重别国主权，恣意干涉别国内政，动辄采取施加压力、强加于人的做法，只能阻塞正常的对话和交流，妨碍理解与合作，是不利于人权的普遍实现的。
    丁原洪说，中国宪法和法律保障了各民族人民享有广泛的权利，包括公民个人的种种权利，这是中国重视人权的具体体现。中国所重视的是实实在在的人权。中国是拥有11亿人口而耕地面积又很少的世界上最大的发展中国家。能吃饱穿暖，不传染疾病，对中国人来说，这比空谈人权口号更重要。
    丁原洪还说，这两天有几个西方国家的代表在发言中诬称中国“镇压了民主运动”，“违反了人权”。他们这样做的目的无非是要为他们粗暴干涉中国的内政寻找借口。事实是，某些西方大国深深地介入了中国的内部事务，支持和扶植反对中国合法政府的力量，从事颠覆活动，力图改变中国的社会主义制度。正是这些国家严重破坏了国际关系的基本准则和联合国宪章的基本原则，粗暴地侵犯了中国的主权。因此，应该受到谴责的是它们，而不是中国。
    他说，从鸦片战争，到八国联军，到八年抗战这近百年的中国历史，使中国人民深知一个国家如果失掉主权，就无人权可言。在中国这片土地上，要维护人权就决不能容忍任何西方势力重新骑在中国人民的头上横行霸道。
    丁原洪大使说，在当今世界上，还存在着种族主义、殖民主义、霸权主义、外国侵略、占领和干涉等大规模侵犯人权的现象。如不消除这种现象，普遍实现人权和基本自由就将成为一句空话。
