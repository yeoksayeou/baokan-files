For quite some time, some key figures in the British government have been exploiting the opportunity presented by China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing to make a series of statements on the Hong Kong issue. They have been loudly proclaiming the so-called "Hong Kong confidence crisis" and advocating the internationalization of the Hong Kong issue. Whenever they have the chance on various international platforms, they loudly advocate for the internationalization of Hong Kong. Recently, the clamor for internationalization has once again reached a fever pitch. They openly declare that "the internationalization of the Hong Kong issue is inevitable, whether economically or politically," and that the Hong Kong issue "must be brought to international discussion." It seems they are still stubbornly trying to play the "internationalization card."

To achieve this absurd proposition, they have concocted all sorts of bizarre arguments, claiming that the "Sino-British Joint Declaration" resolved the sovereignty issue but did not address all the arrangements for Hong Kong's future. They propose that Hong Kong, as an international city with residents of multiple nationalities, should become an "international entity beyond economic interests." They even suggest exploring the possibility of Hong Kong becoming a "member" or "associated member" of the Commonwealth after 1997, and propose various schemes for so-called international supervision of the implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and so on, the list goes on.

The British side is so relentless in inciting other countries and international organizations to interfere in Hong Kong affairs, attempting to use international forces to pressure China and obstruct China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong. This trend cannot but arouse serious concern.

Indeed, Hong Kong is an international financial and trade center with residents of multiple nationalities, and it has close economic ties with countries around the world. However, if this situation is used as a reason to internationalize Hong Kong, then shouldn't international cities like London be even more internationalized? Everyone knows that international cities and internationalization are two completely different things and cannot be confused. Hong Kong has been Chinese territory since ancient times, and the vast majority of Hong Kong residents are Chinese. China's sovereignty over Hong Kong is indisputable. The Chinese government has always advocated maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial and trade center. However, this does not mean that Hong Kong's affairs will be subject to international intervention and control in the future. This is a principle that no sovereign state can abandon. The argument that "Hong Kong's economic internationalization will inevitably lead to political internationalization" is utterly absurd. The claim that Britain has the "right" to bring the Hong Kong issue to international conferences for discussion is not worth refuting. Everyone knows that after long negotiations, the two countries reached a bilateral agreement on the Hong Kong issue in 1984. During the transitional period before 1997, the implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration is a matter between China and Britain; after 1997, Hong Kong will be a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China, and matters related to Hong Kong will be purely China's internal affairs, with no other countries or international organizations having the right to interfere.

It is noteworthy that some British politicians are frequently active internationally, coordinating efforts, and openly calling for other countries to politically participate in Hong Kong. Some politicians from Western powers are also eager to join in, with some in the United States blatantly stating that they "can no longer play the role of passive onlookers" and want to "participate in the development of Hong Kong's affairs." Everyone knows that the British authorities have always strictly controlled Hong Kong, never allowing other countries to interfere politically, but now they have reversed their stance and are vigorously seeking to involve other major powers in Hong Kong's affairs. As some Hong Kong opinions have pointed out, their intention is to tie "foreign interests tightly to Hong Kong" before the 1997 handover of power, "to counterbalance Beijing's influence over Hong Kong."

Since the issue of Hong Kong's return to China was raised, China and Britain have gone through long and arduous negotiations to reach an agreement. To maintain Britain's presence and influence in Hong Kong, the British side made various unreasonable demands during the negotiations and also probed the possibility of internationalization, all of which were firmly rejected by the Chinese government, maintaining China's interests in Hong Kong. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing this year, some British people thought they had an opportunity and once again played the "confidence card," "public opinion card," and "internationalization card" to blackmail China, attempting to obtain what they could not get at the negotiating table. All this makes people suspect that some British politicians have not yet given up their dream of making Hong Kong an independent or semi-independent political entity under British influence after 1997.

Hong Kong was forcibly occupied by Britain over 100 years ago when the Chinese people were powerless, through unequal treaties. The Chinese people have never recognized the unequal treaties imposed by imperialism on China. The Chinese people have fought tenaciously for a long time, paid countless sacrifices and prices, and won national independence. Today, when the Chinese people have stood up, Hong Kong's return to the motherland and China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong is a matter of course. Any attempt to use any pretext to deprive China of its sovereignty over Hong Kong and separate Hong Kong from China is doomed to fail. It should be known that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after 1997 is not a special administrative region of the United Kingdom or the Commonwealth. The idea of continuing British colonial rule over Hong Kong in substance after 1997 through this or that method is completely impractical, and the idea of involving one or two Western countries in a de facto "joint administration" is just a pipe dream. Today's China is no longer the weak and bullied China of over 100 years ago. The Chinese government and people will not yield on the principle of safeguarding independence and sovereignty.

The Chinese government has repeatedly declared that our policy of reform and opening up will not change, the principle of "one country, two systems" will not change, and China will faithfully implement the Sino-British Joint Declaration. For the prosperity of Hong Kong and the long-term interests of China and Britain, we hope that the British side will adopt a wise and realistic attitude, strictly follow the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and not do anything that damages the relationship between the two countries and hurts the feelings of the Chinese people. Only in this way can the relationship between China and Britain return to normal, and can the two countries restore and develop friendly cooperation on the basis of the Joint Declaration, and Hong Kong's future will be bright.

### 香港问题“国际化”的图谋决不能得逞

    香港问题“国际化”的图谋决不能得逞
    谷时平
    相当一个时期以来，英国政府一些要员，利用我国平息在北京发生的反革命暴乱事件在香港问题上做了一系列文章，大肆宣扬所谓“香港信心危机”，鼓吹香港问题“国际化”。他们在不同的国际讲坛上，只要一有机会就大肆鼓吹香港的“国际化”。最近，有关“国际化”的鼓噪再度甚嚣尘上。他们公然说什么“香港问题国际化不论经济或政治上均是大势所趋”，把香港问题“提到国际间讨论不可避免”。看来，他们还固执地想把所谓“国际化牌”打下去。
    为了实现这种荒唐的主张，他们制造了种种离奇的论调，说什么“中英联合声明解决了主权问题，但并未解决所有的香港前途安排”，他们提出香港是多国籍人士居住的国际性城市，应成为“国际上一个超乎经济性的实体”，香港同中国大陆是“绝缘”的。有人甚至主张探索1997年后香港成为英联邦的“成员”或“联系成员”的可能性，对中英联合声明的执行提出各式各样的所谓国际监督的方案，如此等等，不一而足。
    英国方面如此不遗余力地鼓动其他国家和国际组织插手干预香港事务，企图借助国际力量对中国施加压力，阻挠我国对香港恢复行使主权，这一动向不能不引起人们的严重注意。
    诚然，香港是一个有多国籍人士居住的国际金融、贸易中心，它与世界各国有密切的经济联系。但是，如果因为这种情况就要使之“国际化”，那伦敦等国际大城市岂不更应该“国际化”了吗？谁都明白，国际性的城市和“国际化”完全是两码事，二者不能混为一谈。香港自古以来就是中国的领土，香港居民的绝大多数是中国人，中国对香港拥有的主权是无可争辩的。中国政府一向主张保持香港的繁荣与稳定，主张继续维持香港作为国际金融、贸易中心的地位。但是，这不等于将来香港的事务由国际上来干预主宰。这是任何一个主权国家都不能放弃的原则。所谓“香港的经济国际化后政治也必然国际化”的论调是十分荒谬的。鼓吹什么英国“有权”把香港问题提到国际会议上讨论更是不值一驳的。尽人皆知，中英两国经过长期谈判于1984年达成了关于香港问题的双边协议。在1997年以前的过渡时期中，贯彻执行中英联合声明，完全是中英两国之间的事情；1997年以后，香港是中华人民共和国的一个特别行政区，有关香港的事务将纯属中国的内政，其他国家或国际组织对此都无权插手。
    当前，值得注意的是，英国有些政界人士还在国际间频繁活动，进行串联，公然要求别国对香港进行政治参与。有的西方大国的政界人士也跃跃欲试，美国就有人赤裸裸地提出，他们“不能再扮演被动的旁观者的角色”，要“参与香港的事务发展”。谁都知道，英国当局一贯对香港严密控制，从不允许他国势力在政治上染指，而今却一反常态，竭力拉拢其他大国介入香港事务，其用心正如香港的一些舆论指出的那样，是想在1997年政权移交之前把“外国利益紧紧地和香港联系起来”，“以此制衡北京对香港的影响”。
      自从提出香港归还中国问题之后，中英两国是经过长期的、艰苦的谈判才达成协议的。为了保持英国在香港的存在和影响，英方在谈判过程中曾提出种种无理要求，在“国际化”方面也曾作过试探，对此，我国政府坚持原则，断然予以拒绝，维护了中国在香港的权益。今年平息北京的反革命暴乱后，英国一些人以为有机可乘，重又打出了“信心牌”、“民意牌”和“国际化牌”，对中国进行要挟，企图得到他们过去在谈判桌上得不到的东西。这一切使人们不得不怀疑，英国的一些政界人士是否还没有放弃使香港在1997年之后变成一个在英国影响下的独立或半独立的政治实体的梦想。
    香港是在100多年以前中国人民无权的情况下，通过不平等条约被英国强行占领的，中国人民从来都不承认帝国主义强加给中国的不平等条约。中国人民经过了长期的不屈不挠的斗争，付出了无数牺牲和代价，赢得了民族的独立。在中国人民已经站立起来的今天，香港回归祖国，中国恢复对香港行使主权，是天经地义的。想用任何幌子剥夺中国对香港拥有的主权、让香港脱离中国的图谋都是注定要失败的。要知道，1997年之后的香港特别行政区并不是联合王国或英联邦的特别行政区，妄想以这种或那种办法在1997年之后继续在实质上延长英国对香港的殖民统治是根本行不通的，想拉上一两个西方国家搞变相的“共管”也只是痴心妄想。当今的中国，再也不是100多年前的那个贫弱的、任人宰割的中国了。中国政府和人民在维护独立和主权这个原则问题上是决不会让步的。
    我国政府已一再声明，我们改革开放的政策不变，“一国两制”的方针不变，中国将不折不扣地认真贯彻中英联合声明。为香港繁荣计，为中英两国的长远利益计，我们希望英国方面采取明智而现实的态度，严格地按照中英联合声明办事，不再做有损于两国关系和伤害中国人民感情的事情。只有这样，中英关系才能回到正常的轨道上，我们两国才能在联合声明的基础上恢复和发展相互的友好合作，香港的前途也才会是美好的。
