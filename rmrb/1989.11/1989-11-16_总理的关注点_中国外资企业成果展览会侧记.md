November 9th was the day the Fifth Plenum of the Party concluded successfully, and it was also the day the China Foreign-Invested Enterprise Achievement Exhibition opened. In the morning, the first snow of the early winter fell in Beijing. The exhibition hall of the China International Trade Center by the Dabeiyao Interchange was brightly lit.

On July 1st, 1979, China first issued the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Chinese-Foreign Joint Ventures." Ten years later, over 850 foreign-invested enterprises from all over the country gathered in an orderly and impressive array to be inspected.

At 10:00 AM, Premier Li Peng, accompanied by Chen Muhua, Zhang Jinfu, and the Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, Zheng Tuobin, cut the ribbon for the opening ceremony. Subsequently, Li Peng visited the first exhibition hall and the comprehensive exhibition hall on the first floor.

The comprehensive exhibition hall is located in the heart of the exhibition hall, showcasing key joint venture projects related to energy, transportation, and communications, which are crucial to the national economy. These projects received the most attention from Premier Li Peng. He carefully examined the exhibits from the Pingluo Antaibao Open-Pit Coal Mine in Shanxi, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and the Beijing Sanyo Color Picture Tube Limited Company. Pingluo is the largest coal mine project developed and operated through Sino-foreign cooperation, with a total investment of 650 million US dollars. CNOOC, through long-term and extensive cooperation with foreign companies, is developing into a multinational corporation and has established offices in Houston, London, Tokyo, and Hong Kong. The Beijing Sanyo Company is renowned for successfully introducing Japanese-style scientific management.

Li Peng stopped at the booth of the Beijing Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Limited Company. This company, jointly established by China International Airlines and Lufthansa of West Germany, was founded on August 1st of this year and is one of the high-investment projects in Beijing after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots. The total investment is 980 million US dollars. Li Peng showed great concern for this project and had met with the president and chairman of Lufthansa several times during the negotiations. He learned that sending a large passenger plane abroad for maintenance costs 20 million US dollars each time. Today, he asked the company's general manager, Werner Hupe, in detail about the company's situation, including when large passenger planes could be maintained.

Werner replied, "We are building China's largest maintenance hangar, construction will begin next year, and once completed, we will be able to provide this service." He also told Premier Li that the company can currently maintain Boeing 707, 737, 747, 767, and Trident aircraft. Li Peng nodded and smiled, expressing satisfaction with the project's progress.

The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant has a total investment of nearly 4 billion US dollars, all of which are foreign loans. From the site selection, Li Peng had visited the site five times. When he arrived at the Daya Bay booth, the general manager, Zhan Yunlong, came forward to shake hands with Premier Li. Li Peng asked about the quality of the project, the progress, and whether the funds were being invested as planned. Zhan provided a detailed report. Li Peng nodded and encouraged, "The work in the previous phase was good. In the next three to four years, there will be a lot of work, and the task will be heavier. Continue to work hard and build the nuclear power plant well."

Optical fibers are the arteries of modern long-distance communication networks. Two optical fibers thinner than a hair can solve all the communication problems between Beijing and Shanghai. The Changlong Optical Fiber Cable Limited Company, a joint venture between Hubei and the Dutch Philips Company, is a high-tech enterprise. Due to the fact that our country's technology is not up to standard, raw materials still need to be fully imported. During the visit, Li Peng suggested to the company's first deputy general manager, Qiao Bingren, to find the Shanghai Institute of Silicate Research to jointly solve the problem of domestic production of quartz tubes.

This exhibition has three local exhibition halls. The first hall showcases foreign-invested enterprises from Guangdong, Beijing, Tianjin, and other provinces and cities, almost covering all industries such as agriculture, communications, packaging, building materials, office automation, automobiles, bicycles, household appliances, elevators, medicine, fashion, leather, footwear, food, beverages, cosmetics, jewelry, toys, and more. High-quality and high-grade samples form a colorful corridor. Li Peng was particularly concerned about whether the tightening policy had adverse effects on foreign-invested enterprises. He asked the deputy mayor of Tianjin, Li Huifen: "Is the Orange Hotel having sales issues? Are Beijing-brand televisions having sales issues?" Li Huifen replied: "The Orange Hotel is used by hotels, and sales are still good. Televisions are basically not accumulating inventory."

Li Peng then asked, "Which foreign-invested products in Tianjin have poor sales?" Li Huifen said, "After tightening the monetary policy, some new problems have emerged, especially for state-controlled products such as cars, the problems are relatively large, but overall, as long as the quality is good and the price is fair, the market still welcomes foreign-invested products."

At around 11:20 AM, Premier Li Peng left the exhibition hall. At the entrance where he passed, there were photos of Party and state leaders such as Jiang Zemin, Deng Xiaoping, Yang Shangkun, Song Ping, Yao Yilin, Li Ruihuan, Tian Jiyun, Gu Mu, and Chen Muhua visiting foreign-invested enterprises and meeting with foreign investors. Premier Li Peng's photo was also among them. Although he left the hall, he left behind the voice of the Chinese government:

"Welcome more foreign friends to invest and establish enterprises in China."

    总理的关注点
    ——中国外资企业成果展览会侧记
    本报记者  刘霄  梅洪如
    11月9日，是党的五中全会胜利闭幕之日，也是中国外资企业成果展览开幕之时。上午，北京飘落着初冬第一场雪。位于大北窑立交桥畔的中国国际贸易中心展览大厅灯火辉煌。
    1979年7月1日，我国首次颁布了《中华人民共和国中外合资经营企业法》。10年后，来自大江南北的850多家外资企业，以整齐出色的阵容，前来接受检阅。
    10时整，李鹏总理在陈慕华、张劲夫以及经贸部部长郑拓彬等人的陪同下，为大会剪彩。随后，李鹏参观了一楼的一号展馆和综合展馆。
    综合馆位于展厅心脏部位，里面集中了能源、交通、通讯等有关国民经济基础的重点合资项目，受到李鹏总理最大的关注。李鹏仔细观看了山西平朔安太堡露天煤矿、中国海洋石油总公司（CNOOC）和北京松下彩色显像管有限公司的展台。平朔是中外合作开发经营的最大的一个煤矿项目，总投资额6.5亿美元，CNOOC通过与外国公司长期广泛的合作，正在向跨国公司发展，在休斯敦、伦敦、东京和香港都设立了办事处。北京松下公司则以成功地引进日本式的科学管理而著称。
    李鹏在北京飞机维修工程有限公司的展台前停下脚步。这个由中国国际航空公司和联邦德国汉莎航空公司合资开办的企业成立于今年8月1日，是北京平息反革命暴乱后高投资额的项目之一，总投资达9.8亿美元。李鹏对这个项目非常关心，在双方协商过程中，他曾几次会见汉莎航空公司的总裁和董事长。他得知，一架大型客机送往国外维修一次，需要花费200万美元。今天，他向合资公司的总经理威尔内·胡佩详细询问了公司的情况，包括何时可以对大型客机进行维修。
    威尔内答道：“我们正在筹建中国最大的维修机库，明年开始施工，一旦落成，就可以提供这方面的服务了。”他还告诉李总理，目前公司已能维护波音707、737、747、767和三叉戟五种机型的飞机了。李鹏颔首微笑，对项目的进展表示满意。
    大亚湾核电站总投资额将近40亿美元，全部使用国外贷款。从选址开始，李鹏先后五次前往视察。当他走到大亚湾展台时，总经理昝云龙上前与李鹏总理握手。李鹏问工程的质量如何，进度怎样，资金是否按预算投入，昝总一一作了汇报。李鹏点点头，鼓励道：“前一阶段工作不错，今后三四年有很大的工作量，任务更重了，要继续努力，把核电站搞好。”
    光纤是现代化长途通讯网络的动脉。两根比头发丝还细的光纤，一来一往，可以解决北京和上海两个直辖市之间的全部通话问题。湖北和荷兰菲利普公司合资举办的长龙光纤光缆有限公司属于高技术企业，由于我国工艺不过关，原材料还需全部进口。参观时，李鹏建议公司第一副总经理乔秉仁找一找上海的硅酸盐研究所，共同解决石英管国产化的问题。
    这次展览会有3个地方馆。广东、北京、天津等省市的外资企业荟萃于一号馆，几乎囊括了农业、通讯、包装、建材、办公自动化、汽车、自行车、家用电器、电梯、医药、时装、皮革、制鞋、食品、饮料、化妆品、首饰、玩具等所有行业，高质量高档次的样品组成了一条彩色长廊。李鹏十分关心紧缩政策对外资企业是否带来不良影响。他问天津市副市长李慧芬：橙宝有没有滞销？北京牌电视机有没有滞销？李慧芬回答说：橙宝大饭店用，销路还可以。电视机基本不积压。
    李鹏又问：“天津外资产品中哪一些销路不大好？”李慧芬说：“紧缩银根以后，出现了一些新的问题，特别是国家控购的汽车等，问题比较大，但是总的看来，只要质量好，价格公道，外资企业的产品，市场还是欢迎的。”
    11点20分左右，李鹏总理离开了展览大厅。在他经过的门口处，悬挂着江泽民、邓小平、杨尚昆、宋平、姚依林、李瑞环、田纪云、谷牧、陈慕华等党和国家领导人参观外资企业和接见外国投资者的照片，李鹏总理的照片也在其中。他虽然离开了大厅，但是却留下了中国政府的声音：
    “欢迎更多的外国朋友来中国投资办企业。”
