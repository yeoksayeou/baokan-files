A university president in El Salvador, Spanish missionary Ignacio Ellacuria, was shot and killed early in the morning of the 16th at his residence by a group of unidentified armed individuals. Five other Spanish missionaries, a Salvadoran woman worker, and her 15-year-old daughter were also killed in the incident.

Ellacuria had played a very important role in the political life of El Salvador in recent years. In addition to serving as the president of the University of Central America, he was also the influential editor-in-chief of the journal "Central American Studies." It is reported that for a long time, Ellacuria had been the target of hostility from the extreme right-wing forces in the country.
