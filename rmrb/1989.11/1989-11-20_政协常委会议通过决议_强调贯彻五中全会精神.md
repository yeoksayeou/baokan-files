The Standing Committee of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) unanimously approved and supported the important decisions made by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) regarding economic work and personnel adjustments.

The meeting fully agreed with and supported the decisions made by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the CPC. The meeting believed that the "Decision of the Central Committee of the CPC on Further Rectification and Deepening of Reform" comprehensively analyzed the current economic situation in China, fully affirmed the tremendous achievements in economic construction and reform and opening-up since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the CPC, realistically assessed the difficulties in current economic work and the favorable conditions for overcoming these difficulties, and proposed a series of correct measures for further rectification and deepening of reform based on a profound summary of experience. The implementation of this decision is of great significance for further stabilizing and developing China's political and economic situation, overcoming the tendency to seek quick results, and ensuring the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy.

The meeting highly praised Deng Xiaoping's significant contributions in various historical periods of the Chinese revolution and construction. It also highly praised Deng Xiaoping's effective work in consolidating and developing China's united front and creating a new situation in the work of the CPPCC. The meeting believed that the series of viewpoints and theories proposed by Deng Xiaoping based on the principle of combining Marxism-Leninism with Chinese realities, especially the basic theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, is the inheritance and development of Mao Zedong Thought under new historical conditions. It is necessary to seriously study Deng Xiaoping's works and give full play to their important guiding role in China's socialist modernization construction. The meeting pointed out that Deng Xiaoping, from the fundamental interests of the CPC and the whole country, resigned from his current posts while in good health, setting an example for abolishing the lifelong tenure of leadership positions, fully demonstrating the broad-mindedness of an outstanding proletarian revolutionary.

The meeting pointed out that taking economic construction as the center, adhering to the four cardinal principles, adhering to reform and opening-up, self-reliance, and hard work to build a modern socialist country is the common task of all parties, non-partisan patriots, people's organizations, ethnic groups, and people from all walks of life participating in the CPPCC. Continuing to firmly implement the policy of rectification and deepening of reform is the fundamental way to overcome current economic difficulties and achieve the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy. The CPPCC at all levels should, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, strive to accomplish the tasks proposed by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

The meeting required that the CPPCC at all levels and its members should seriously study and implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, seriously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, unify their understanding, strengthen their confidence, consolidate and develop the stable situation across the country, and create favorable conditions for the smooth implementation of rectification and deepening of reform. They should fully support and assist the work of the CPC committees and the people's governments, earnestly perform the functions of political consultation and democratic supervision, focus on the tasks of rectification and deepening of reform, strengthen investigations and research, actively propose suggestions, opinions, and criticisms, and promote the smooth progress of this work. They should give full play to the advantages of the CPPCC, widely unite all democratic parties, non-partisan patriots, people's organizations, ethnic groups, and people from all walks of life, as well as the broad masses they are connected with, and work together to overcome all difficulties in the process of advancing, strive for new victories in rectification and deepening of reform and socialist modernization construction, and make due contributions.
