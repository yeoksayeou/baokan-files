Soldiers have their own refined interests, and the island has its unique pleasures.

One day, we crossed the sea by boat to visit the garrison company on Kongtong Island. After a brief greeting, Political Instructor Li Honglu led us to their company aquarium. We saw that along the walls of the room, there was a circle of platforms about a meter high, on which were placed various sizes of glass containers. Each container held a type of marine organism preserved in a clear liquid treated with formalin. There were common sea crabs and sea turtles, as well as rare abalone and "armored fish," and even rare sea treasures like white sea cucumbers and five-fingered fish, totaling 67 species. As decorations, there were dried specimens of sea snails, oysters, starfish, clams, and other marine creatures. These specimens, skillfully crafted by the soldiers, were arranged into landscapes of mountains and clear waters, small birds with startled glances, and fleets of ships ready to embark on distant voyages. The displays were vivid and lifelike.

Every year, when new recruits arrive on the island, they first visit the aquarium. Seeing these marine products, which they have never seen in their inland hometowns, they develop a deep affection for the island. During holidays, the soldiers hold unique "marine life knowledge competitions" here. The host presents a specimen and asks about its name, characteristics, living habits, and catching methods. The soldiers eagerly answer, finding it both interesting and educational. Before the soldiers leave the island upon retirement, they each receive a specimen from the "company aquarium" as the most precious "island souvenir." Even leaders from the PLA General Headquarters and the military region, after visiting the Kongtong Island company aquarium, cherish the seashell and shellcraft gifts given in the name of the "company aquarium" as precious mementos. An old Red Army veteran and general, after inspecting the work on the island, was given a seashell ashtray made by the soldiers. The old general happily said, "This ashtray is more precious than gold or jade. I will keep it forever. Seeing it, I will remember this 'company aquarium' and these lovable island guards!"

It is reported that this "company aquarium" is unique in the army, with no other comparable facility. The relevant departments of Yantai City are also planning to open it as an attraction to domestic and foreign tourists.

    连队水族馆
    战士有战士的雅兴，海岛有海岛的乐趣。
    这天，我们跨海飞舟，来到崆峒岛守备连。稍叙寒暄，指导员李洪禄就领着我们来到他们的连队水族馆。只见屋内靠墙的一圈一米多高的平台上，挨次摆放着高高矮矮、大大小小的玻璃容器，每个容器里都用清澈的液体浸泡着一种经福尔马林处置过的海洋生物。有常见的海蟹、海龟，有珍贵的鲍鱼、“加甲鱼”，还有稀世海珍白海参、五指鱼，共有67种。作为点缀的是一些用海螺、海蛎子、海星、海贝、海蛤等干制的标本。这些标本经战士巧手加工，组合成山清水秀、林阁相间的盆景，受惊回眸、展翅欲飞的“小鸟”，列阵有致、扬帆远征的“舰队”，真是多姿多彩，栩栩如生。
    每年新兵一上岛，总是首先到水族馆参观，看着这些在内陆家乡见所未见的海产品，热爱海岛之情油然而生。节假日，战士们在这里举行别开生面的“海生物知识竞赛”，主持人拿出某个标本，问名称、属性、生活特点及捕捞方法，战士抢答，既饶有兴趣，又增长知识。战士们退役离岛前，都要从“连队水族馆”领受一件标本，作为最珍贵的“守岛纪念品”。就连解放军总部、军区机关领导同志来岛后，对以“连队水族馆”名义赠送的海螺、贝壳等艺术制品，也像宝贝似地珍惜，作为参观崆峒岛连队水族馆纪念。一位老红军、老将军来岛视察工作后，战士们把亲自制做的一个海螺烟灰缸赠送给他。老将军高兴地说：“这个烟灰缸比金的玉的还宝贵，我要永远保存。看到它，我就会想起这个‘连队水族馆’，想起这些可亲可爱的守岛战士！”
    据悉，这个“连队水族馆”在我军“只此一家，别无分店”。烟台市有关部门还准备将它作为一“景”，向国内外游客开放呢。
