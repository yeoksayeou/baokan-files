The nationally significant cultural relic, the Temple and Tomb of Sima Qian, which was once in grave danger, has undergone extensive reinforcement and protection over the past year and is now open to visitors.

The Temple and Tomb of Sima Qian is located on a 75-meter-high cliff in Nan Yishan, Zhi Chuan Town, Hancheng City, Shaanxi Province, presenting a magnificent view. The large-scale protection project for the Temple and Tomb of Sima Qian began with the Shaanxi Provincial Bureau of Cultural Relics allocating funds to divert the Zhi River, thereby stopping the erosion of the cliff. Subsequently, the State Bureau of Cultural Relics allocated funds, and the Hancheng City government implemented comprehensive reinforcement measures for the temple and tomb. The total investment for the project was approximately 2.3 million yuan.

    司马迁祠墓整修开放
    本报西安电　一度岌岌可危的全国重点文物保护单位——司马迁祠墓，经过一年多时间的大规模加固保护，如今已对游人开放。
    司马迁祠墓坐落在陕西省韩城市芝川镇南奕坡梁75米高的悬壁上，气势极为壮观。这次对司马迁祠墓的大规模保护工程，先是由陕西省文物局拨款改道芝水，终止了对崖岸的冲刷。接着由国家文物局拨款、由韩城市具体实施，对祠墓进行全面加固。整个工程投资约230万元。（刘炳琦　孟西安）
