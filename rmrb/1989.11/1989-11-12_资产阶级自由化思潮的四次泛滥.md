The first outbreak of bourgeois liberalization thought occurred during the period when our party was working to rectify past mistakes. In 1979, those who were eager to promote bourgeois liberalization took our party's correct slogan of emancipating the mind, distorted it, and used the pretext of opposing the "two whatevers" to oppose the four cardinal principles.

This outbreak of bourgeois liberalization caused a certain degree of social disorder. Beijing saw the emergence of the "Xidan Wall," the Wei Jingsheng counter-revolutionary incident, and the appearance of some illegal organizations and publications in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places.

The second outbreak occurred around 1983, when serious spiritual pollution emerged. A few theoretical workers created confusion on issues such as humanism and alienation. They misused the concept of "alienation" to provide theoretical weapons for the social trend of denying the party's leadership and the socialist system.

The third outbreak occurred around 1986, with bourgeois liberalization thought becoming more rampant and escalating. It evolved from the previous covert, indirect, and suggestive forms to open, barefaced attacks, from theoretical discussions to street protests; from isolated, scattered activities to coordinated efforts, forming a united front. Figures such as Fang Lizhi, Wang Ruowang, and Liu Binyan emerged as representatives of bourgeois liberalization.

Due to the rampant bourgeois liberalization, a nationwide student movement erupted at the end of 1986 and the beginning of 1987.

The fourth outbreak of bourgeois liberalization began in the latter half of 1988. The representatives of bourgeois liberalization had clearer targets: to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and implement capitalist private ownership. In the spring and summer of this year, they instigated student movements, leading to turmoil and riots.

    资产阶级自由化思潮的四次泛滥
    第一次发生在我们党着手进行拨乱反正的过程中。1979年，热衷于搞资产阶级自由化的人把我们党提出的解放思想的正确口号接过去，加以歪曲，打着反对“两个凡是”的幌子反对四项基本原则。
    这次资产阶级自由化的泛滥，在一定程度上引起了社会秩序的混乱。北京出现了“西单墙”，发生了魏京生反革命事件，北京、上海等地出现了一些非法组织、非法刊物。
    第二次发生在1983年前后，这时出现了严重的精神污染。少数理论工作者在人道主义、异化等问题上制造思想混乱，他们滥用“异化”的概念，为否定党的领导、否定社会主义制度的社会思潮提供了理论武器。
    第三次发生在1986年前后，资产阶级自由化思想泛滥和逐步升级。由原来的比较隐蔽、旁敲侧击、影射的形式，发展到公开的、赤裸裸的攻击，由理论探讨发展到上街游行示威；由原来的个别分散的活动发展到互相串联，互相勾结，形成联合之势。出现了方励之、王若望、刘宾雁等一些搞资产阶级自由化的代表人物。
    由于资产阶级自由化的泛滥，酿成了1986年底、1987年初的全国性学潮。
    第四次资产阶级自由化泛滥，从1988年下半年开始。搞资产阶级自由化的代表人物，已有了更加明确的目标：即推翻中国共产党领导，推行资本主义私有制。今年春夏，他们挑起了学潮，并酿成动乱和暴乱。
