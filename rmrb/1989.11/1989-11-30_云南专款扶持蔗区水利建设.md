Yunnan Province has recently allocated 10 million yuan as a special fund for water conservancy projects in sugar cane growing regions. The provincial government has also decided to allocate half of the three yuan collected per ton of sugar cane during procurement to water conservancy construction, aiming to promote the sustainable development of sugar production. Sugar is one of Yunnan's six key industries. Since 1982, Yunnan has allocated 500 million yuan annually for water conservancy projects in sugar cane regions. This year marks the highest allocation to date. Yunnan has become the third-largest sugar-producing province in China.
