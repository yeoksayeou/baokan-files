Edition: 5

The research on comprehensive conservation strategy, planning, and countermeasures is of great significance for the current efforts to rectify the economic environment, restore economic order, and for long-term development. China's economic construction must rely on the two wheels of "increasing production" and "conservation" to follow a path of intensive development, in order to smoothly achieve the strategic goal of economic revitalization. For this purpose, we are organizing the research on "Comprehensive Conservation Strategy, Planning, and Countermeasures in China." To mobilize social forces and timely gather advanced experiences, outstanding research results, and rational suggestions from various regions, industries, enterprises, social research institutions, and experts with rich practical experience, we will, in addition to organizing specialized forces to conduct systematic research, launch a nationwide call for papers. This is to collect wisdom from the masses and pool ideas, to contribute to the formulation of the three-year adjustment plan, the "Eighth Five-Year Plan," and the long-term conservation plan for the country.

1. Analysis of the potential and existing problems of comprehensive conservation;
2. Introduction to various conservation experiences, measures, and their effects;

4. Suggestions for technical and policy measures to achieve comprehensive conservation (including macro and micro levels);
5. Suggestions for the conservation of major production factors (energy, minerals, raw materials, funds, land, transportation, water resources, etc.);
6. Suggestions for improving various economic, technological, and management activities (planning, design, construction, technical transformation, scientific research, industrial structure, etc.) to promote comprehensive conservation.

II. Requirements:
Papers must be closely related to reality, logical, concise, targeted, and practical. Within the scope of the above content, different domains such as the nation, regions, industries, and enterprises can propose technical and economic measures, planning ideas, policy suggestions, or experience introductions.
