In the heart of Botswana's capital, Gaborone, stands an 11-story modern building that captures the attention of passersby. This is the famous De Beers Botswana Mining Company's Diamond House. Of course, its appeal is not just its unique architectural style, but the work of the people bustling behind the brown-tinted glass. Their joys and sorrows greatly influence the fate of the entire nation.

Before independence, Botswana was one of the poorest countries in Africa, with a per capita income of less than fifty dollars. Three-quarters of its territory was covered by the Kalahari Desert. There was no water, no oil, and nearly all of its one million residents were illiterate. At that time, when Europeans mentioned this country, they would only think of half-naked native guides and African buffaloes fleeing from the sound of hunters' guns.

Political independence and economic takeoff came simultaneously to this southern African land. In 1967, just two years after Botswana's independence, a large diamond deposit was discovered in the Orapa region, with reserves second only to Tanzania's Mwadui mine, ranking second in the world. Soon after, two more large diamond deposits were discovered in the Letlhakane and Jwaneng regions, and mining began. In the early 1970s, the first batch of Botswana diamonds appeared on the world diamond market. A large number of untapped diamond mines laid the foundation for Botswana's economic takeoff. Tens of billions of dollars in foreign capital poured in, and the once-dead desert came to life with the roar of engines. The history of this former British colony began a new chapter.

In just twenty years, Botswana rose from nothing to become the world's second-largest diamond producer and exporter, second only to Zaire. In 1988, Botswana's diamond production was 136 million carats (one carat equals 0.2 grams), earning foreign exchange that accounted for 57% of the country's budget revenue that year. Mining (including copper, nickel, and coal) has become the country's leading economic pillar, attracting almost all foreign capital. All the diamonds produced in the country are gathered in the Diamond House in the capital, where they undergo several screenings and grading before being sent to the world's four major diamond processing centers—Antwerp, London, Tel Aviv, and Mumbai—to be polished into diamonds. The rolling in of diamond foreign exchange has strongly driven Botswana's socio-economic and cultural development. Since the 1970s, Botswana's average annual economic growth rate has been 12%, and in 1988, its per capita GDP exceeded $1,000, an increase of more than twentyfold compared to before independence. Currently, Botswana has 715 kilometers of railways and 13,000 kilometers of roads. The country provides free medical care and free education nationwide.

While Botswana's economy is developing rapidly, it also faces some weaknesses. Firstly, there is a serious dependence on South Africa. Half of the country's diamond industry is owned by South Africa's De Beers Company, and four-fifths of the diamond and other mineral resources are exported to South Africa. Most industrial products and a significant portion of food are also imported from South Africa. Additionally, the problem of economic monoculture is prominent. In 1981, diamond exports accounted for 40% of the country's total foreign exchange earnings, rising to 76% in 1988. Due to the impact of six consecutive years of drought and land desertification, food production has been slow to increase and has not been able to achieve self-sufficiency.

The Botswana government is actively taking measures to address these issues. To reduce the import of industrial consumer goods, several small and medium-sized enterprises in food, bricks, furniture, leather, textiles, metal processing, and chemicals have been gradually established in recent years. The Botswana government has also formulated policies to vigorously develop agriculture and animal husbandry. Meanwhile, the tourism industry is also receiving increasing attention. It is expected that Botswana's economy, built on the foundation of diamonds, will develop even faster.

### 金刚石——博茨瓦纳经济的铺路石

    金刚石——
    博茨瓦纳经济的铺路石
    胡锡进
    博茨瓦纳首都哈博罗内市中心矗立着一幢十一层的现代建筑，吸引着过往行人的注意力，这就是闻名世界的博茨瓦纳——德比尔矿业公司的金刚石大楼。当然，它的引人之处决不只是独特的建筑风格，而是在那一块块茶色玻璃背后忙碌着的人们进行的工作。他们的喜与忧在很大程度上决定着整个国家的命运。
    独立前的博茨瓦纳是非洲最穷的国家之一，人均收入不足五十美元。领土的四分之三被卡拉哈里大沙漠覆盖。没有水，没有石油，全国的一百万居民几乎全是文盲。那时欧洲人提起这个国家，只会想起半裸的土著向导和在狩猎者枪声中惊跑的非洲野牛。
    政治上的独立和经济上的起飞同时来到这块南部非洲的土地。一九六七年，也就是博独立后的第二年，奥拉帕地区发现大型金刚石矿床，储量仅次于坦桑尼亚的姆瓦杜矿，居世界第二位。紧接着，莱特拉卡内和吉嫩瓦地区又连续发现两处大型金刚石矿，并陆续投入开采。七十年代初，第一批博茨瓦纳钻石出现在世界钻石市场上。大批等待开采的金刚石矿为博茨瓦纳经济的起飞奠定了基础。十多亿美元的外国资本蜂拥而至，昔日沉死的荒漠在隆隆的马达声中苏醒过来，大英帝国旧殖民地的历史从此翻开新的一页。
    短短的二十年间，博茨瓦纳从零起步，成为仅次于扎伊尔的世界第二大金刚石生产国和出口国。一九八八年博金刚石产量为一点三六亿克拉（一克拉等于零点二克），换回的外汇占当年国家预算收入的百分之五十七。采矿业（包括铜、镍、煤的开采）现已成为这个国家的头号经济支柱，集中了几乎全部外国资本。全国生产的金刚石统统汇集到位于首都的金刚石大楼，在这里几经筛选、确定级别后再被送到世界四大金刚石加工中心——安特卫普、伦敦、特拉维夫、孟买打磨成钻石。滚滚而来的金刚石外汇有力地推动了博社会经济文化的发展。七十年代以来，博年平均经济增长率为百分之十二，一九八八年人均国民生产总值超过一千美元，比独立前提高二十多倍。目前博已有铁路七百一十五公里，公路一点三万公里。全国实行了免费医疗和免费教育。
    博经济在迅速发展的同时，也存在一些弱点。首先是对南非的严重依赖。全国金刚石行业的一半股分属于南非的德彼尔公司，金刚石和其它矿物资源的五分之四向南非出口，绝大部分工业品和相当一部分粮食也要从南非进口。此外，经济单一的问题也很突出。一九八一年，金刚石出口额占全国外汇总收入的百分之四十，一九八八年上升到百分之七十六。由于受连续六年干旱和土地沙漠化的影响，粮食生产却迟迟上不去，无法达到自给。
    对于这些问题，博茨瓦纳政府正在积极采取措施加以解决。为减少工业消费品的进口，近年来逐步建立起一批食品、砖瓦、家具、皮革、纺织、金属加工、化工等中小型企业。博政府还制定了大力发展农牧业的政策。与此同时，旅游业也日益受到重视。人们预计，建立在金刚石基础之上的博茨瓦纳经济将会有更快的发展。
