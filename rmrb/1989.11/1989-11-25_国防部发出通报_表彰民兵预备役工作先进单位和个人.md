It encourages them to uphold the four cardinal principles, oppose bourgeois liberalization, love the motherland, dedicate themselves to national defense, face hardships and sacrifices, dare to reform, and strive for progress. It urges them to work hard and make new contributions to strengthening China's reserve forces and achieving the Four Modernizations.
