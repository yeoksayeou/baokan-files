November 12, 1939, is an unforgettable day for all the staff of the Norman Bethune International Peace Hospital. That year, Comrade Norman Bethune helped the Chinese people in their time of need to establish this hospital, and it was on this day that he sacrificed his life on the job at this hospital. Half a century has passed, and the white-clad soldiers of this hospital have always held high the glorious banner of Norman Bethune, enduring the tests of war and construction, and also facing the challenges of reform and opening up. People praise them as being worthy of the name of Norman Bethune.

The white marble statue of Norman Bethune standing in the hospital courtyard, and the permanent slogan on the building, "Be a revolutionary in the spirit of Norman Bethune, be a scientist in the spirit of Norman Bethune," serve as a motivation and a spur for those who work here diligently. No matter how tumultuous the society is, no matter how unsatisfactory the social customs are, "Being a successor to the spirit of Norman Bethune, being a doctor in the spirit of Norman Bethune" is their slogan and their actual actions.

	"Treat only if profitable, do not treat if not profitable." Such phenomena occur in many hospitals. However, the Norman Bethune Hospital demands of itself: "Treat what others do not treat, accept what others reject."

	"Treating burns is difficult, nursing is hard, one patient costs tens of thousands." Many hospitals therefore do not want to accept burn patients. However, the Norman Bethune Hospital specially opened a burn department in Shijiazhuang, and in one year, it helped more than 400 burn patients recover their health.

	The peasant woman Liu Shuting from Guangping County was paralyzed for 12 years. Her husband carried her for thousands of miles, spent tens of thousands of yuan, visited more than 60 hospitals, underwent six surgeries in vain, and her paralysis worsened. This spring, she came to the Norman Bethune Hospital. After a detailed examination by experts in abdominal surgery, she was diagnosed with a sacral teratoma and quickly underwent surgery. On the 21st day, this laboring woman, who had been bedridden for a long time, stood up miraculously. Looking back on the past and present, the couple were so moved that they cried and repeatedly thanked the Norman Bethune Hospital.

	"Extreme responsibility to work, extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people." This is Comrade Mao Zedong's summary of the spirit of Norman Bethune, and it is also the guideline for the staff of the Norman Bethune Hospital today.

	Sudden death is the enemy of heart disease patients, and timely mouth-to-mouth artificial respiration can often bring patients back from the brink of death. However, patients may carry bacteria and toxins, and may have foul odors. For male and female doctors, it takes sufficient courage and dedication to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. The staff of the cardiology and nephrology department, led by Dr. Ning Peiyu, however, disregarded social prejudices and personal safety, and universally practiced mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, saving many patients who would otherwise have died.

	Chen Xinyi, the head nurse of the internal medicine department, known as the "female Norman Bethune" by patients, has been diligently caring for patients for five years, almost never spending a Sunday at home. She overworked and fell ill, and her young son was injured and disabled. However, all of this did not weaken her enthusiasm for her career and her patients. She continued to work tirelessly while receiving treatment.

	The great internationalist spirit of Comrade Norman Bethune is the most precious legacy left to the Norman Bethune Hospital. They take Norman Bethune as their example. In the past, during the Korean War, they fought side by side with the Chinese people. Today, in the medical teams supporting the Third World, there are their experts. In the early 1970s, when all military hospitals were in a state of strict closure, they were the first to open their doors to the world. To this day, they have received nearly a hundred countries and more than 20,000 foreign friends for visits, diagnoses, and treatments.

    学习白求恩精神的模范
    ——记白求恩国际和平医院
    新华社记者　李秀清　新华社通讯员　海春辉
    1939年11月12日，是白求恩国际和平医院全体同志最难忘的日子。当年白求恩同志帮助危难中的中国人民创建了这所医院，最后他就在这个日子里牺牲在这所医院的工作岗位上。时历半个世纪，这个医院的白衣战士始终高扬着白求恩的光荣旗帜，经受了战争和建设的考验，也赢得了改革开放的挑战。人们赞扬他们无愧于白求恩的名字。
    矗立于院内的白求恩汉白玉雕像，大楼上“做白求恩式的革命者，做白求恩式的科学家”的永久性大标语，对于在这里辛勤工作的人们是一种激励，一种鞭策。不管社会上风起浪涌，不管世风怎样的不尽如人意，“做白求恩精神的传人、做白求恩式的医生”，是他们的口号，更是他们的实际行动。
      “利少不治，无利不收。”这种现象在不少医院时有发生。而白求恩医院则要求自己：“别人不治的咱治，别人推出的咱收。”
      “治烧伤，护理难，一个病人花几万。”许多医院因此不愿接收烧伤病人。而白求恩医院在石家庄特地开办的烧伤科，一年就使400多位烧伤患者恢复了健康。
    广平县农妇刘书廷瘫痪12年，丈夫背着她行程万里，花钱万元，进出60多家医院，白挨了6刀，瘫痪病有增无减。今年春天，她来到白求恩医院，经腹外科专家详细检查，确诊为骶部畸胎瘤，很快动了手术。第21天，这位久卧病床的劳动妇女奇迹般地站立起来。抚今追昔，夫妻二人激动得痛哭失声，一再感谢白求恩医院。
    “对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”这是毛泽东同志对白求恩精神的概括，也是今天白求恩医院的同志行医做人的指南。
    猝死，是心脏病患者的大敌，而及时的口对口的人工呼吸却常常能使患者死而复生。但是，患者带菌含毒，或腥或臭。这对男女医生来说，没有足够的勇气和献身精神是很难做到的。以女医生宁佩萸为主任的心肾内科的同志们，却不顾世俗的偏见和个人的安危，普遍开展了口对口人工呼吸法，使大批过去难以生还的猝死患者死而复生。
    被患者称为“女白求恩”的内三科护士长陈欣怡，任职5年，兢兢业业地护理病人，几乎没在家里过一个星期天。她劳累过度，身患疾病，年幼的儿子无人照料，摔伤致残。但是，这一切都未能削弱她对事业对患者的热情，一边治疗，一边坚持不懈地工作。
    白求恩同志的伟大的国际主义精神，更是留给白求恩医院的最宝贵的财富。他们以白求恩为榜样，昔日抗美援朝的战场上有他们出生入死的身影，今天在支援第三世界的医疗队伍里有他们专家。70年代初，当全军各医院还在严格封闭状态之中的时候，他们第一个向全世界敞开了大门。至今他们已接待了近百个国家、2万余名外国朋友来参观访问、诊断治疗。
