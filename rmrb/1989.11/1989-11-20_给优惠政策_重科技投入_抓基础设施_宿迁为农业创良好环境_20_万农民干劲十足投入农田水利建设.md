200,000 farmers in Suqian are enthusiastically engaged in agricultural water conservancy construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Suqian, November 20th

The 200,000 water conservancy workers in Suqian City, Jiangsu Province, are currently engaged in winter water conservancy construction. Zhang Wen-guo, the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, said that the farmers' enthusiasm is so high because the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government have created a good environment for the development of agriculture.

With the deepening of the reform, Suqian has continuously adjusted its industrial structure, but the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government have always adhered to the guiding ideology of taking agriculture as the foundation, emphasizing the use of preferential policies to continuously mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses to plant grain, and the grain production in the whole city has been steadily increasing year by year.

To ensure that agricultural production will reach a new level next year, in early September, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government issued three documents: the Supplementary Regulations on Encouraging the Development of Cotton Production, the Regulations on Encouraging the Expansion of Mulberry Gardens and the Interplanting of Green Manure, and the Regulations on Encouraging the Development of Aquaculture. Among them, the rewards for cotton production include production quantity rewards, logistics service rewards, and technological service rewards. It is also clearly stipulated that if the supply of agricultural materials such as pesticides, fertilizers, and agricultural films by the relevant departments fails to meet the planned requirements, causing losses, the departments will compensate for the entire loss. For farmers who invest in the development of wasteland, tidal flats, and wasteland on their own, it is stipulated that they will not have to pay the accumulated amount for three years. For those who apply more than 5,000 kilograms of organic fertilizer per mu, rewards will be given.

Turning science and technology into productive forces is another key move by Suqian City to promote agriculture. In recent years, they have focused on the two-stage large seedling transplantation of rice, the no-tillage sowing method for three types of wheat, and the continuous selection of high-quality and high-yield rice and wheat varieties, which have significantly promoted grain production. To popularize new technologies, the agricultural department has adopted methods such as issuing materials, holding lectures, and organizing training classes to effectively pass on technologies to farmers. Now, the whole city has initially formed a scientific and technological network, with agricultural technology stations in towns, agricultural technology personnel in villages, and scientific and technological demonstration households in groups.

This city also attaches great importance to the construction of agricultural infrastructure. The municipal government divides water conservancy projects into three types every year: those that must be undertaken by the city, those that must be undertaken by the townships, and those that must be undertaken by the villages and groups, and raises funds through multiple channels for construction. Over the past three years, farmers in the entire city have invested 20 million man-days of labor and 12 million yuan in funds, of which 70% was self-raised. They have successively repaired and opened more than 4,000 ditches, improved and increased the irrigation and flood control area by more than 1.1 million mu, and transformed 80,000 mu of low-yield fields. Since 1986, this city has won the first prize for agricultural water conservancy construction in Jiangsu Province for three consecutive years. In the past two years, towns and villages and farmers in the entire city have invested nearly 10 million yuan to purchase agricultural machinery, achieving full mechanization in plowing, threshing, and drainage. During the busy farming season, the Municipal Agricultural Mechanization Company organizes maintenance teams to go to the countryside for repairs and maintenance of agricultural machinery, assisting various agricultural machinery stations in their work.

    给优惠政策　重科技投入　抓基础设施
    宿迁为农业创良好环境
    20万农民干劲十足投入农田水利建设
    本报讯　江苏省宿迁市20万水利大军正投入冬季水利建设。市委书记张文国说，农民的干劲之所以这样足，关键是市委、市政府为发展农业创造了良好的环境。
    随着改革的深入，宿迁不断调整产业结构，但市委、市政府一直坚持以农业为基础的指导思想，注重用优惠的政策，不断调动群众种粮的积极性，全市粮食生产连年稳步增长。
    为保证明年农业生产再上新台阶，今年9月上旬，市委、市政府又下发了关于鼓励发展棉花生产的补充规定、关于鼓励拓殖桑园套种绿肥的规定和关于鼓励发展水产生产的三个文件，其中对棉花生产的奖励有产量奖、后勤服务奖和科技服务奖，并明确规定如果确因生产资料部门没按计划保证供应农药、化肥、农膜而造成损失的，由其赔偿全部损失。对于农户自己投资开发荒地、荒滩和荒水的，规定三年内不上交积累。对于施农家肥每亩高于5000公斤的，给予奖励。
    把科技转化为生产力，是宿迁市促进农业的又一着。近几年，他们着重抓水稻育秧的两段大苗移栽、三麦播种免耕法，不断选定优质高产的稻麦新品种，对粮食增产起了显著的促进作用。为普及新技术，农业部门采取下发材料、举办讲座和办培训班等形式，切实把技术交给农户。现在全市已初步形成科技网络，乡有农技站，村有农技员，组有科技示范户。
    这个市还十分重视农业基础设施建设。市政府每年都把水利工程分为市指办、乡必办、村组自办三种类型，多渠道集资搞建设。3年来，全市农民共投入劳动工日2000万个，投入资金1200万元，其中自筹的占70％。先后整修和新开沟渠4000多条，改善和增加灌溉、防涝面积110多万亩，改造低产田8万亩。1986年以来，这个市连续3年获得江苏省农田水利建设1等奖。近两年，全市乡村和农户投资近千万元，购买农机具，耕种、脱粒和排灌全部实现了机械化。每逢大忙季节，市农机化公司都组织了维修队下乡巡回维修农机，协助各农机站做好服务工作。
