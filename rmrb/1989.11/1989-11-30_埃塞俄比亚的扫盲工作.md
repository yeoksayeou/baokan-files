Ethiopia is one of the famous ancient countries on the African continent, with a civilization history of over 3000 years. It is the second African country after Egypt to have a written language. However, under the long-term rule of the feudal system, the vast majority of the working people were deprived of the right to education. Ethiopia became one of the countries with the highest number of illiterates in the world. By the time of the 1974 revolution, illiterates accounted for 93% of the country's 42 million population.

The revolutionary government, from its inception, placed great importance on the literacy campaign. Over the past 15 years, a widespread mass literacy movement has gradually taken shape across the country.

In December 1974, just three months after the revolutionary government was established, the government organized a large number of college and high school students to go to the countryside. While helping farmers establish cooperative organizations and restore and develop agricultural and pastoral production, they also set up literacy classes. This work continued for a year and a half, achieving the goal of making 700,000 farmers literate. This experience accumulated valuable lessons for further promoting the mass literacy movement and laid the organizational foundation for launching a large-scale mass literacy campaign.

In April 1976, the revolutionary government formulated and issued the "Program of the National Democratic Revolution," clearly stipulating that "free education will be gradually provided to the masses" and "all measures will be taken to eliminate illiteracy." Subsequently, literacy and compulsory education work were carried out simultaneously according to the plan. After meticulous preparation, the first phase of the national literacy campaign began in June 1979, with each phase lasting five months to intensify education. In addition to teaching basic knowledge of hygiene and agriculture and animal husbandry, the focus was on teaching literacy and mastering practical arithmetic. The latter two were required to reach the level of fifth-grade education.

The slogan of Ethiopia's literacy campaign is: "Those who can read should become teachers, and those who cannot read should become students." Since 1978, the method of sending a large number of intellectuals to the countryside has no longer been used. Instead, cadres, teachers, and students (11th grade and above) at all levels across the country conduct literacy teaching in their local areas. All cadres at various levels of the party and government, and cadres of mass organizations who have the conditions to teach must participate in literacy teaching activities. Mengistu Haile Mariam, Chairman of the Workers' Party and President of the Republic, has personally conducted literacy teaching in the army, rural areas, and even in open-air classrooms in the fields on many occasions. Over the past 10 years, 40% of the literacy expenses have come from donations from various sectors of society and corporate organizations. Some administrative units and military units have donated their saved administrative funds to support literacy activities.

Ethiopia has 80 ethnic groups and nearly 80 languages and scripts. After expert analysis and integration, these 80 languages and scripts were categorized into 15 language systems. The languages and scripts used for literacy are all based on these 15 systems and are carried out simultaneously. For example, literacy books, newspapers, and radio teaching all have the same content but in different languages and scripts. So far, there are 161 kinds of literacy periodicals and newspapers.

Fully utilizing radio for literacy teaching is also an important means. At present, in addition to the Central Educational Radio Station in the capital, there are 11 educational radio stations across the country, conducting supplementary literacy teaching during the early morning and evening leisure time of the masses. The national radio coverage rate has reached over 80%, and radio has played a huge role in literacy and long-distance teaching.

Starting from the third phase, the literacy task in cities has been basically completed, and the focus has shifted to the vast rural areas, making the task more arduous. The literacy campaign is closely coordinated with the village movement. Teaching is combined with agricultural work, utilizing newly built public venues in rural areas as classrooms and teaching according to the needs of the students. According to statistics, there are now 9,500 reading rooms and 13,000 reading groups across the country, promoting mutual learning.

July 8th is Ethiopia's statutory "Literacy Day." On this day this year, marking the 10th anniversary of the literacy campaign, various meetings and activities were held from the central to the local levels to summarize the experiences, achievements, and problems of the literacy work. Over the past 10 years, 21 phases of literacy campaigns have been conducted, and 76.3% of the population has become literate. Those who have obtained qualified certificates through examinations total 19.5 million, while the remaining approximately 200-300 million people are still continuing their studies.

Ethiopia's literacy achievements have been recognized, encouraged, and supported by the international community. Since 1980, Ethiopia has successively received four medals from UNESCO and other academic organizations. Over the past 10 years, 5% of the total literacy expenses have come from international community support.

After 10 years of literacy campaigns, the first stage of the mass movement is nearing its end. The remaining 23.7% includes preschool children, disabled people who do not have the conditions to study, elderly people, remote and underdeveloped areas, and urban and rural literacy blind spots. The executive secretary of the National Literacy Campaign Central Coordination Committee told the author: In the last one or two years of the first stage, the focus will be on solving the above problems. In addition, it is worth noting and being vigilant that, in addition to timely enrolling children of school age into compulsory education every year, it is still necessary to promptly address the semi-literate and re-illiteracy phenomena in adult literacy education. If the goal of the first stage of the literacy campaign is to popularize literacy, then the goal of the second stage will be to improve the quality and, on the basis of literacy in the national language and script, further promote national language education. This executive secretary said with confidence that the government is determined to work hard to improve the cultural quality of the entire nation and to improve the cultural and scientific level of the entire nation.

　　埃塞俄比亚的扫盲工作
　　徐世光
    埃塞俄比亚是非洲大陆的闻名古国之一，有3000多年的文明史，它是继埃及之后有书写文字的第二个非洲国家。但是，在长期封建制度统治下，广大劳动人民被剥夺了受教育的权利，埃塞俄比亚成了世界上文盲人数最多的国家之一，到1974年革命时，文盲占全国4200万人口的93％。
    革命政权成立伊始便十分重视扫盲工作。15年来，全国已逐步形成广泛的群众性扫盲活动。
    1974年12月，革命政权成立刚三个月，政府便组织大批大中学校青年学生上山下乡，在协助农民建立合作化组织，恢复和发展农牧业生产的同时，举办扫盲学习班。这一工作持续了一年半，取得了使70万农民脱盲的成绩，为进一步开展群众扫盲运动积累了经验，也为开展大规模的群众性扫盲活动奠定了组织基础。
    1976年4月，革命政府制定并颁布了《民族民主革命纲领》，明确规定“将逐步对广大群众实行免费教育”和“采取一切措施消灭文盲”。随之，扫盲和义务教育工作都按计划同步进行。经过缜密的准备，全国扫盲运动第一轮从1979年6月开始，每轮扫盲为期五个月，进行强化教育。除教授卫生和农牧业基本知识外，重点在于教会识字和掌握实用的算术。后两者要求达到五年级水平。
    埃塞俄比亚扫盲运动的口号是：“识字的都去当老师，不识字的都来作学生”。从1978年以后，不再采用大规模知识分子上山下乡办法，而是使全国各级干部、教师、学生（11年级以上）就近在本地进行扫盲教学。各级党政干部、群众组织干部，凡是具备教学条件的，必须参加扫盲教学活动。工人党主席、共和国总统门格斯图就多次亲自到部队、农村甚至在田间“露天教室”进行扫盲教学。10年来扫盲开支的40％是来自社会各阶层、企业团体的资助，有的行政单位和部队，将节约下来的行政经费资助扫盲活动。
    埃塞俄比亚有80个民族，近80种语言文字。经过专家分析综合，将这80种语言文字归纳为15种语系。确定扫盲的语言文字都以这15种为准同步进行。譬如扫盲书刊、报纸和广播教学都是同一内容、不同的语言文字。至今已有161种扫盲期刊和报纸。
    充分使用广播手段进行扫盲教学也是一个重要手段。目前，除设在首都的中央教育电台外，全国还有11个教育电台，用早晚群众工余时间进行辅导性扫盲教学。全国广播覆盖率达80％以上，广播在扫盲和远距离教学中发挥了巨大作用。
    从第三轮起，城市扫盲任务基本完成，开始转向广大农村，任务更为艰巨。扫盲运动紧密地配合了村落化运动。教学与农忙、农闲相配合，利用农村新建的公共场所作为教室，因材施教。据统计，全国至今已有9500个阅读室，13000个读书小组开展互帮互学。
    每年的7月8日是埃塞俄比亚法定的“扫盲日”。今年的这一天，正是扫盲运动10周年，从中央到地方召开了多种会议和活动，总结扫盲工作经验、成绩和问题。10年来已进行21轮扫盲，有76.3％的人口脱盲。经考试得到合格证书的达1950万人，其余约有200—300万人还在继续学习。
    埃塞俄比亚的扫盲成绩已得到国际社会的承认、鼓励和支持。埃塞俄比亚从1980年起陆续得到联合国教科文组织和其他学术组织颁发的四次奖章。10年来，扫盲总开支的5％来自国际社会的资助。
    10年扫盲至今，作为群众运动第一阶段已近尾声，余下的23.7％，包括学龄前儿童，不具备学习条件的残疾人、高龄老人、边远偏僻地区和城乡扫盲死角。全国扫盲运动中央协调委员会执行秘书对笔者说：第一阶段的最后一两年，将着重解决上述问题。此外，值得注意和警惕的问题是，除了要及时把逐年进入学龄的儿童纳入义务教育轨道外，仍要随时抓紧解决在成人扫盲教育中的夹生、返“盲”现象，如果说扫盲运动第一阶段是以普及识字为目标，那么第二阶段目标将是质的提高和在本民族语言文字扫盲的基础上进一步推广国语化。这位执行秘书信心十足地说，政府决心为提高全民文化素质，提高全民的文化科学水平而努力。（附图片）
