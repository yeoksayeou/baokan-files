Yunnan Establishes Rural Production Service System
Relying on Society to Handle What One Household Cannot Do Alone

	Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Qinghai reports: Recently, during a discussion on rural work, Yunnan Provincial Party Secretary Pu Chaozhu proposed that the household contract responsibility system is in line with Yunnan's level of productivity and should continue to be implemented. The current direction and goal of deepening rural reforms is to establish and improve various socialized production service systems, providing farmers with pre-production, in-production, and post-production services, and solving problems that individual households cannot handle or handle well. According to the Provincial Party Committee's Rural Work Department, currently, Yunnan has accumulated some effective practices in this regard and has gained initial experience.

	—Establish a management service system for public facilities and public property. Since 1984, out of the 125 counties (cities) in the province, 94 have established over 3,500 agricultural economic service stations at the township and village levels. These stations have conducted a thorough inventory of collective funds and property, recovered 1.08 billion yuan in overdue payments from farmers to collectives, and used the funds for rural production and various public welfare projects. In addition, over 800 agricultural machinery management service stations have been established.

	—Establish a rural science and technology service system. The province has initially formed a rural science and technology promotion network with the provincial and prefecture (state) levels providing guidance, counties as the hub, townships (towns) as the backbone, villages as the base, and science and technology demonstration households as the bridge. 60% of the townships (towns) have established over 900 science popularization associations. During this autumn's grain production, over 14,000 agricultural science personnel at various levels participated in the front lines of contract management. The area covered by science and technology contract management and technical support services reached over 10 million mu, accounting for one-third of the autumn grain planting area.

	—Establish an agricultural production materials service system. In addition to various levels of supply and marketing cooperatives, a series of service outlets have been established, led by the provincial agricultural materials company and supported by prefecture (state) and county agricultural materials companies. These outlets jointly organize the supply of fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural films, delivering goods to the doorstep.

	—Establish an agricultural product circulation service system to serve the collection, storage, transportation, and sales of agricultural products.

　　云南建立农村生产服务体系
　　靠社会办一家一户办不了办不好的事
    本报讯　新华社记者王青海报道：云南省委书记普朝柱最近在讨论农村工作时提出，家庭联产承包责任制符合云南生产力水平，要继续实行。当前农村深化改革的方向和目标是建立健全各种社会化生产服务体系，为农民提供产前、产中和产后服务，解决好一家一户办不了和办不好的事情。据省委农村工作部介绍，目前，云南各地在这方面积累了一些有效做法，取得初步经验。
    ——建立公共设施和公共财产的经营管理服务体系。1984年以来，全省125个县（市）中，有94个县建立了乡、村农经服务站3500多个，对集体的资金、财产进行了认真清理，收回农民超欠集体款10.8亿元，用于农村生产和各种公益事业。此外，还建立起农机管理服务站800多个。
    ——建立农村科技服务体系。全省农村初步形成以省地（州）为指导、县为中枢、乡（镇）为骨干、村为基础、科技示范户为桥梁的农村科技推广网络。60％的乡（镇）建立了科普协会900多个。今年秋粮生产中，全省到第一线参加承包的各级农科人员达1.4万人，科技联产承包和技术配套服务的面积达1000多万亩，占秋粮种植面积的1／3。
    ——建立农业生产资料服务体系。除各级供销社外，建立了由省农资公司牵头、地（州）县农资公司为依托的系列化服务网点，共同组织供应化肥、农药、农膜等农业生产资料，送货上门。
    ——建立农产品流通服务体系，为农产品的收购、储存、运输、销售服务。
