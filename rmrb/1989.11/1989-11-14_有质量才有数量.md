Comrades from Zhenhua have proposed the idea of indirectly expanding cultivated land, which is quite innovative. Land also has a relationship between quantity and quality, and a common phenomenon across various regions is the neglect of quality.

Issues worth further discussion include: how to dialectically understand the superiority and inferiority of land, and how to guide farmers to invest in improving soil fertility?

In China, the yield per unit area of existing cultivated land varies greatly, with high, medium, and low yields each roughly accounting for one-third. The highest yield per mu of grain is over 1 ton, and cottonseed is 100 to 150 kilograms. The lowest yield per mu of grain is less than 50 kilograms, and cottonseed is less than 20 kilograms. If everyone can focus on improving land quality, and increase the yield of saline-alkali land, red and yellow soils, sandy soils, and low-yield rice fields by several dozen to 100 kilograms per mu, the potential is quite significant.

### 有质量才有数量

    有质量才有数量
    遵化的同志提出间接扩大耕地面积，很有点新意。土地也有个数量与质量的关系问题，而各地比较普遍存在一个现象是：忽视质量。
    值得进一步讨论的问题有：怎样辩证地认识土地的优与劣？如何引导农民下本钱提高地力？
    我国现有耕地中单位面积产量差距很大，产量高、中、低大体各占1／3，单产最高的亩产粮食1吨多，皮棉100公斤至150公斤；最低的亩产粮食不到50公斤，皮棉不到20公斤。大家若能在提高土地质量上做点文章，使那些盐碱地、红黄壤、风沙土以至低产水稻田的单产提高几十公斤至100公斤，潜力是相当可观的。
