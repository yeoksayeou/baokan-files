Chancellor Kohl of the Federal Republic of Germany, who arrived in Warsaw yesterday afternoon, abruptly cut short his visit to Poland and flew back to his country this afternoon.

According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, Kohl's decision to cut short his visit is related to the situation that arose after the German Democratic Republic decided to open its border with the Federal Republic of Germany. After the German Democratic Republic opened its border with the Federal Republic of Germany, a large number of citizens from the German Democratic Republic rushed into the Federal Republic of Germany and West Berlin, causing serious economic and social pressure on the Federal Republic of Germany and West Berlin.

Before leaving Poland, Kohl said he was prepared to return to Poland in the evening of November 11 to continue the visit, which had been prepared for over two years.

    科尔中断访波回国
    新华社华沙11月10日电　昨天下午抵达华沙的联邦德国总理科尔突然中断对波兰的访问，于今天下午乘飞机回国。
    据波通社报道，科尔中断访问与民主德国决定开放同联邦德国边界后出现的形势有关。民主德国开放同联邦德国的边界后，民主德国公民大量涌入联邦德国和西柏林，对联邦德国和西柏林造成了严重经济和社会压力。
    科尔离波前表示，他准备在11日傍晚返回波兰，继续进行经过长达两年筹备的这次访问。
