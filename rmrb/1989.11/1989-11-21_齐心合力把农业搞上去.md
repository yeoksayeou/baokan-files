The recently concluded Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China solemnly proposed: We must swiftly create a nationwide atmosphere of valuing, supporting, and developing agriculture, and unite our efforts to boost agriculture.

Agriculture is the foundation for the stability of the entire national economy. Stabilizing 800 million farmers means stabilizing the overall situation. This is a truth proven by years of experience. Currently, a significant portion of the economic difficulties we face are directly or indirectly related to the stagnation of China's agriculture since 1985. Over these five years, China's grain production has fluctuated around 400 billion kilograms without achieving new heights, while the population has increased by six or seven thousand. With the rapid development of processing industries, the contradiction between supply and demand is bound to intensify, leading to a series of problems. It can be said that agriculture has become a "bottleneck" constraining China's sustained, stable, and coordinated economic development. Without addressing this issue, the task of rectification and adjustment will be difficult to complete.

It is precisely from this reality that the Central Committee has placed the development of agriculture in an extremely important position. It has reiterated that all economic work must adhere to the principle of prioritizing agriculture. From the central to local governments at all levels, party committees and governments must strengthen leadership, with county and municipal leaders focusing their main efforts on developing agriculture, especially grain and cotton production. The Central Committee has also proposed that in the future, the ability to increase grain, cotton, and other major agricultural products, and whether agriculture has strengthened its momentum, should be important criteria for evaluating the work of provinces, municipalities, and counties.

Attention to agriculture cannot remain at the level of rhetoric; it must be translated into action. Farmers eagerly hope to turn "slogan agriculture" into "investment agriculture," providing real support to agriculture in terms of policy, funds, materials, technology, and other aspects. This demand is reasonable and should be taken seriously. The central and local governments should strive to increase investment in agriculture each year, primarily for the development of agricultural machinery, the production of fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural machinery, large-scale agricultural water conservancy projects, and agricultural research to improve the basic conditions for agricultural development. Some provinces and cities have allocated a significant portion of their local financial resources to agriculture and have established agricultural development funds and other methods to raise funds for agriculture, with noticeable effects, which should be encouraged. However, it must be explained to the farmers that the country's financial resources are limited and the fiscal situation is difficult, so the country's investment in agriculture cannot increase significantly at once. The most important thing is still the farmers' own investment. It is necessary to advocate the spirit of hard work and encourage farmers to use the money they have saved to expand production, and labor accumulation is an important way of investment. Agricultural water conservancy construction, improvement of low-yield fields, promotion and application of scientific and technological advancements, fine farming, fertilizer application, seed selection, and breeding, etc., all require the labor of farmers. It should be noted that our advantage is the abundance of labor, and there is great potential to replace capital investment with labor accumulation.

To maintain the farmers' enthusiasm for investment over the long term, it is necessary to create a good environment, and one of the most important aspects is policy stability. Farmers support the Party's rural policies but are also concerned about policy changes. One of the successful experiences of rural reform is the need to maintain the stability of basic policies. Therefore, it is necessary to frequently carry out propaganda and education on policy stability among rural cadres and the masses, using stable policies to encourage farmers to invest with confidence. The household contract responsibility system, which is based on family operations, is in line with the level of productivity in most parts of China and should be maintained and continuously improved. It is necessary to actively establish and improve the production and technological service system before, during, and after production, and to strive to perfect the dual management mechanism of combining centralization and decentralization, promoting the development of rural commodity economy. In a few areas with conditions, it is possible to advocate for appropriate scale operations based on the principle of farmers' voluntary participation, to improve land productivity, and to actively advocate for the development of collective economy and enhance the economic strength of towns and townships. However, it must be done cautiously and not cause damage to the existing productivity; things that the masses do not want should not be forced; and things that are not mature should not be forcibly implemented.

To encourage farmers to invest in land and increase the production of grain, cotton, and other major agricultural products, the state will, according to needs and possibilities, gradually adjust the purchase prices of agricultural products in a planned manner. The notice to raise the prices of cotton and oil crops next year has already been issued. Local governments should also take measures according to this spirit, flexibly and reasonably coordinate the comparative benefits in the rural economy, and strive to make grain farmers and cotton farmers benefit more from increased production.

Actively promoting the application of advanced agricultural science and technology is a key link in the development of agriculture and an important part of increasing agricultural investment. It is necessary to further mobilize and organize scientific and technological personnel to go to the countryside, carry out technical contracting, and strengthen the training of farmers. Governments at all levels should create conditions and mobilize the enthusiasm of agricultural scientific and technological personnel to promote advanced technology and the enthusiasm of farmers to adopt advanced technology.

We should also raise the slogan of all sectors actively supporting agriculture, establishing the honor of supporting agriculture and the disgrace of harming agriculture. We should do a good job of supplying agricultural production materials and give necessary support to the "agriculture" industry in terms of funds, energy, etc. All departments should help farmers solve difficulties in a practical way.

Since last year, due to the attention of party committees and governments at all levels and the efforts of farmers, agriculture has been steadily improving, and the situation has been gradually improving. This year, although some areas have suffered severe droughts, grain, cotton, oil crops, and various economic crops have all increased to a certain extent. At present, many places are focusing on agricultural water conservancy construction to create favorable conditions for a bumper harvest next year. This shows that as long as the upper and lower levels truly attach importance to it, the sustained and stable development of agriculture is full of hope. Let us take action under the guidance of the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session, unite our efforts, and boost agriculture!

　　齐心合力把农业搞上去
　　本报评论员
    最近闭幕的党的十三届五中全会郑重提出：要迅速在全党全国造成一个重视农业、支援农业和发展农业的热潮，齐心合力把农业搞上去。
    农业稳定，是整个国民经济稳定的基础。稳定了8亿农民，也就稳定了全局。这是多年事实证明的道理。目前我们面临的经济困难，相当部分就直接、间接与1985年以来我国农业连年徘徊密切相关。这5年，我国粮食产量始终在4000亿公斤上下浮动，没有创出新的水平；而人口却净增了六七千万，加工工业又迅猛发展。一增一停，供需矛盾必然加剧，带来一系列的问题。可以说农业已经成为制约我国经济持续、稳定、协调发展的一个“瓶颈”。不重视这个问题，治理整顿的任务也难以顺利完成。
    正是从这种实际出发，这次中央全会把发展农业放到了极为重要的位置，再次重申：各项经济工作要贯彻以农业为基础的方针；从中央到地方各级党委和政府都要切实加强领导，地、县领导更要把主要精力放在发展农业特别是粮食、棉花生产上。中央还提出，今后要把粮食、棉花和其他主要农副产品能不能搞上去，农业是否增强了后劲，作为考核省、地、市、县工作的重要标准。
    对农业的重视不能停留在口头上，必须落实在行动中。农民群众热切期望把“口号农业”变为“投入农业”，从政策、资金、物资、科技等各方面给农业以实实在在的支持。这种要求是合理的，应当予以重视。中央和地方都要尽可能逐年增加对农业的投入，主要用于发展农用工业，增产化肥、农药、农机等，用于大型农田水利建设，用于农业科研，以改善农业发展基本条件。一些省市，挤出较多的地方机动财力用于农业，并用建立农业建设基金制度等方法多方为农业筹集资金，效果明显，应该提倡。但同时要向广大农民讲明，目前国家财力有限、财政困难，国家对农业的投入不可能一下子增加很多，更重要的还是靠农民自己投入。要提倡艰苦奋斗精神，鼓励农民把积攒下来的钱更多地用于扩大再生产，而劳动积累更是重要的投入方式。农田水利建设，中低产田改造，科学技术推广应用，精耕细作、积肥用肥、选育良种等等，都离不开农民的劳动。应该看到，劳动力多，是我们的突出优势，用劳动积累替代资金投入有很大的潜力。
    保持农民投入积极性长久不衰，需要创造良好的环境，其中非常重要的是政策要稳定。农民拥护党的农村政策，也担心政策变。农村改革成功经验之一，就是必须保持基本政策的稳定。因此，必须向广大农村干部、群众经常进行政策稳定的宣传教育，用稳定的政策鼓励农民放心地投入。以家庭经营为主的联产承包责任制符合我国大部分地区的生产力水平，要保持稳定并不断完善。要积极建立和健全产前、产中、产后的生产与科技服务体系，努力完善统分结合的双层经营机制，促进农村商品经济的发展。在少数有条件的地方，可以根据农民自愿原则，提倡适度规模经营，以提高土地产出率，同时积极提倡发展集体经济，增强乡镇经济实力。但一定要稳妥，不要造成现有生产力的破坏；群众不愿意的事，不要勉强去做；条件不成熟的地方，不要硬性推行。
    为了鼓励农民向土地投入，增产粮食、棉花等主要农产品，国家根据需要和可能，有计划地逐步调整农产品的收购价格。明年提高棉花、油料价格的通知已经公布。各地也应本着这个精神，因地制宜地采取措施，合理地协调农村经济中的比较利益关系，尽可能使粮农、棉农通过增产多得实惠。
    积极推广适用的先进农业科学技术，是发展农业的关键一环，也是增加农业投入的重要内容。要进一步动员、组织科技人员下乡，开展科技承包，加强对农民的技术培训。各级政府要多方创造条件，调动农业科技人员推广先进技术、广大农民采用先进技术的积极性。
    我们还应该重新提起各行各业都大力支援农业的口号，树立支农光荣、坑农可耻的风气。切实做好农用生产资料供应工作，对“农”字的产业，应从资金、能源等方面给予必要的倾斜。各部门要切实地帮助农民解决困难。
    去年以来，由于各级党委、政府的重视，广大农民的努力，农业正稳步升温，形势逐步好转。今年，虽然局部地区遇到严重干旱，但粮食、棉花、油料和各种经济作物，都有一定幅度的增长。目前，许多地方都在大抓农田水利基本建设，为明年夺取丰收创造有利条件。这说明，只要上下真正重视，农业的持续、稳定发展，是大有希望的。让我们在五中全会精神指引下切实行动起来，齐心合力，把农业搞上去！
