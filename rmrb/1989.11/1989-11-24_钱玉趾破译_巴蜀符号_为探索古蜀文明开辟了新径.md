Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 23rd — (Reporter Feng Xianshou) Senior Engineer Money Yuzhi of the Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Association recently revealed that he has deciphered three "Ba-Shu symbols."

Money Yuzhi used the Yi script to decipher the "Ba-Shu symbols." Based on the language and grammatical rules of the Yi people living in the southwestern mountainous regions of China, as well as the general rules of bronze inscriptions, he believes that three symbols inscribed on a bronze weapon dating back 2,400 years can be interpreted as "the bronze dagger used by Nuosu."

"Ba-Shu symbols" is the term used by archaeologists to refer to various graphic symbols found on artifacts from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods unearthed in Sichuan. So far, approximately 150 different symbols have been discovered.

Money Yuzhi, through his research, has proposed that "Ba-Shu symbols" might be a phonetic script that existed in ancient Shu. This has attracted widespread attention both domestically and internationally. Archaeologists believe that Money Yuzhi's research has opened a new path to unraveling the mysteries of the "Ba-Shu symbols" and exploring the ancient Shu civilization.

　　钱玉趾破译“巴蜀符号”
　　为探索古蜀文明开辟了新径
    据新华社成都11月23日电　（记者冯先受）四川省科学技术协会高级工程师钱玉趾新近透露，他破译了三个“巴蜀符号”。
    钱玉趾是运用彝文破译“巴蜀符号”的。他根据居住在我国西南山区彝族的语言、语法规则以及铜器铭文的一般规律，认为铭刻在距今2400年前的一件铜制兵器上的三个符号可以释读为“诺苏使用的铜戈”。
    “巴蜀符号”是考古界对四川出土的春秋战国时期器物上一些图形符号的统称。迄今为止已发现的不同图符约有150种。
    钱玉趾通过考证，曾提出“巴蜀符号”可能是古蜀地存在过的一种拼音文字的看法，在海内外引起了广泛的关注。考古界人士认为，钱玉趾的研究为揭开“巴蜀符号”的奥秘、探索古蜀文明开辟了一条新途径。
