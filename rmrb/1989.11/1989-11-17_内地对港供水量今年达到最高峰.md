The reporter learned from the Dongjiang-Shenzhen Water Supply Engineering Management Bureau in Guangdong Province that this year, the mainland's water supply to Hong Kong reached 612 million cubic meters, accounting for 70% of Hong Kong's annual water demand, marking the highest water supply volume from the mainland to Hong Kong in history.

This year, Guangdong experienced a severe drought, with the water inflow to the Shenzhen reservoirs significantly lower than during the severe drought of 1963. However, clean water continues to flow into Hong Kong, and Hong Kong residents have long been accustomed to a 24-hour water supply. Water rationing has become a bitter memory of the past.

    内地对港供水量今年达到最高峰
    据新华社香港十一月十六日电 （记者钟丽琼）记者从广东省东江深圳供水工程管理局了解到，今年内地对香港的食水供应量为六点一二亿立方米，占香港全年需水量的百分之七十，达到内地对港历年来供水量的最高峰。
    今年广东遇特大干旱，深圳水库的来水量大大低于遇百年大旱的一九六三年，但清水仍源源流入香港，港人对全日供水早就习以为常。限时供水，已成为过来人的苦涩的记忆。
