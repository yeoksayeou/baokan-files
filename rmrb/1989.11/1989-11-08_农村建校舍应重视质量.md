In recent years, rural areas across the country have, through collective fundraising, built and expanded many school buildings, significantly improving the poor conditions of rural schools. However, regrettably, some newly built school buildings have become dilapidated within just two or three years. In some places, there have even been incidents of buildings collapsing and injuring or killing students.

Recently, a reporter visited some rural areas in Shanxi and learned from relevant departments that the phenomenon of newly built school buildings becoming dilapidated within two or three years is quite common.

In 1984, the people of Yushu County's Xima Township collectively raised over 20,000 yuan to build 17 new classrooms. Teachers and students moved into the new buildings, overjoyed. However, they did not expect that the newly installed beams, purlins, and rafters would be riddled with holes by insects within a year. By 1988, the roof began to sag, and the beams were on the verge of breaking, necessitating a complete rebuild.

In 1984, the new school building in Qiaoshang Village, Changzhi County, began to sag and crack soon after completion. This year, during a heavy rain, the building collapsed, injuring two students.

Why do newly built school buildings quickly become dilapidated? The reason is that some leaders have been negligent, rushing into construction, and in some places, new school buildings were even constructed without blueprints.

Poor construction quality and the lack of an inspection system are also reasons why new buildings become dilapidated. For example, in 1984, a certain town in Jiang County collectively raised 2 million yuan to build 154 new middle school classrooms. Due to the above reasons, 130 of these have now become dilapidated.

Collective fundraising to build new school buildings is a great cause that benefits future generations. However, we cannot just focus on the immediate appearance and ignore the quality of the buildings, showing indifference to the safety of teachers and students.

It is time to prioritize the quality of new school buildings.

### 农村建校舍应重视质量

    农村建校舍应重视质量
    近几年，广大农村通过集资办学，新建、扩建了许多校舍，大大改变了乡村学校校舍破、旧、差的状况。然而，令人遗憾的是，一部分新建校舍仅仅在两三年之内就又变成了危房，有的地方发生坍塌甚至砸伤砸死学生的事件。
    记者最近在山西一些乡村采访，从有关部门了解到，农村新建校舍两三年内就变成危房的现象比较普遍。
    榆社县西马乡中学1984年由群众集资两万多元新盖了17间校舍，师生迁入新居，喜上眉头。然而，没想到新上的大梁、檩、椽一年以后就被虫子蛀出许多孔洞，到1988年房顶开始下沉，大梁眼看就要断裂，只得重新翻盖。
    长治县桥上村小学1984年新盖的校舍，盖成不久便顶陷墙裂，今年在一场大雨中坍塌，砸伤两名学生。
    新盖校舍为何很快变成危房？原因是一些领导敷衍了事，仓促动工，甚至有些地方建新校舍连图纸也没有。
    施工质量差和无验收制度也是新房成危房的原因之一。如绛县某镇1984年集资20万元，新建镇初中校舍154间，由于上述原因，现已有130间成为危房。
    集资办学、新建校舍，是造福子孙后代的大事。可是，我们不能光图形式上的一时风光，忽视房屋质量，对师生的安全漠不关心。
    现在是重视新建校舍质量问题的时候了。
