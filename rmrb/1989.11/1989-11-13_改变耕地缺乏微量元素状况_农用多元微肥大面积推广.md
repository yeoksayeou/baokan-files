The situation in which Chinese farmland lacks microelements, leading to low crop yields, is set to change. A multi-element microfertilizer developed by the Soil and Fertilizer Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences has entered the stage of large-scale promotion and application. Experts estimate that its application will significantly increase crop yields across the country.

Three years of research and practical application have proven that, based on the use of the same amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers and organic fertilizers, the application of multi-element microfertilizers can increase the yield of vegetables, wheat, corn, soybeans, peanuts, watermelons, grapes, apples, and other crops by more than 10%.

Currently, it is internationally recognized that there are 16 essential nutrients for crops. The phenomenon of microelement deficiency in Chinese farmland is very common. Among them, more than 40% of the farmland is deficient in boron, more than 30% is deficient in zinc, and some soils are also deficient in manganese, molybdenum, copper, and other microelements.

At present, 15 factories across the country have started mass production using the multi-element microfertilizer formula developed by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The area of microfertilizer application reached 95 million mu in 1988.

    改变耕地缺乏微量元素状况
    农用多元微肥大面积推广
    据新华社北京11月11日电 （记者高鹤君　赵明亮）我国耕地因缺乏微量元素而造成农作物低产的局面，将得到改变。由中国农业科学院土壤肥料研究所研制成功的农用多元微肥已进入大面积推广应用阶段。据专家估计，它的应用，能使我国农作物大面积增产。
    通过3年研究和实践证明，在施用同样氮、磷、钾化肥和有机肥的基础上使用多元微肥，蔬菜、小麦、玉米、大豆、花生、西瓜、葡萄、苹果等均可增产一成以上。
    目前世界公认，农作物必需的营养元素共有16种。我国耕地缺乏微量元素的现象非常普遍，其中以缺硼为主的耕地占40％以上，以缺锌为主的耕地占30％以上，还有的土壤缺乏锰、钼、铜等微量元素。
    全国已有15个厂家运用中国农业科学院的多元微肥配方开始了批量生产，1988年微肥使用面积已达9500万亩。
