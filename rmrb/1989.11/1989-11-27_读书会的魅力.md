In the golden autumn of October, at a meeting convened by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Beijing Municipal Women's Federation was invited to introduce their well-known "Mass Book Club." This book club, which was established just a year ago, has already attracted over 100,000 urban and rural residents. Even during a time when the market is flooded with yellow and low-brow publications, the 700-plus exchange points of this book club persist in providing people with healthy and beneficial spiritual nourishment.

In the urban areas, the members of the book club are mainly retired personnel, employees of small enterprises, street vendors, and individual business owners. Their demand for books and their free time vary greatly. To address this, Comrade Zhou Yulian of the Women's Federation exchange point on Andingmen Hutong has developed a set of experiences. In addition to providing book exchanges for members every day of the week, she also carefully studies the interests of the members and delivers books to their doorsteps as needed.

Eighty percent of the members of the Mass Book Club are farmers from the suburbs. They live in scattered locations, and their interest in reading varies. How did they become the main force of the book club? From the practices of the Women's Federations in counties such as Tongxian, Changping, and Miyun, we can find the answer: lively and engaging forms such as essay contests on reading experiences and reading knowledge competitions have sparked everyone's enthusiasm for acquiring knowledge and refining their tastes; practical technical knowledge and wealth-creation information, like timely rain, have magnetically attracted everyone to the book club.

The book club has brought rural women into a brand-new realm. In the past, women would gather in small groups to gossip when they had nothing to do. Since the establishment of the book club, their lives have been enriched with many new and fresh contents: national affairs, scientific farming, new trends in life, etc., have become their favorite topics of conversation.

Now, this little flower of socialist spiritual civilization, the Mass Book Club, has just bloomed and has already won the deep affection of urban and rural residents.

　　读书会的魅力
　　潘跃
    金秋十月，在全国政协召开的一次会上，北京市妇联应邀介绍了她们创办的颇有名气的“大众读书会”。这个一年前诞生的大众读书会，目前已吸引了城乡十万余人。即使在黄色书刊和格调不高的书刊充斥文化市场的时候，这个读书会的七百多个换阅点，也坚持为人们提供健康有益的精神食粮。
    在市区，读书会的会员主要是离退休人员、小企业职工、小商贩和个体户。他们对书刊的需求和闲暇时间都各不相同。针对这个特点，安定门头条妇代会换阅点的周玉莲同志，摸索出一套经验。除了每周全天都为会员换阅外，她还悉心研究会员的爱好，因人制宜送书上门。
    大众读书会的会员，百分之八十是郊区农民。他们居住分散，对读书的兴趣参差不齐，怎么竟成了读书会的主力呢？从通县、昌平、密云等县妇联的做法中我们可以找到答案：读书心得征文、读书知识竞赛等生动活泼的形式，激发起大家增长知识、陶冶情趣的热忱；及时雨一样的实用技术、致富知识，使读书会磁石般地吸引着大家。
    读书会使农妇们进入了一个崭新的境界。往日，妇女三三两两闲着没事时磨牙嚼舌，自建读书会后，她们的生活充实进了许多新鲜内容：国家大事、科学种田、生活新潮等等，已成为她们津津乐道的新话题。
    如今，大众读书会这个社会主义精神文明的小花，刚刚开放，便得到城乡人们的深深爱戴。
