    Ten Great Ancient Chinese Melodies

    High Mountains and Flowing Water: It is said that during the pre-Qin period, the lute master Bo Ya once played the lute in a desolate mountain, and the woodcutter Zhong Ziqi was able to understand that it depicted "the lofty aspirations of mountains" and "the vast aspirations of flowing water." Bo Ya exclaimed, "How wonderful! Your heart is the same as mine." After Ziqi's death, Bo Ya lost his soulmate and smashed his lute, never playing it again. Thus, the melody "High Mountains and Flowing Water" was created.

    Guangling San: A lute melody, also known as "Guangling Stop." It is one of the Han and Wei period's harmonious melodies. Jian Kang, who opposed the Sima clan's rule, was executed. Before his execution, he calmly played this melody to express his feelings. The earliest surviving lute score is found in "The Mysterious and Strange Score."

    Level Sands and Descending Geese: During the Ming Dynasty, this melody was known as "Geese Descending on Level Sands." The melody is smooth and flowing, depicting the scene of geese descending, hovering, and looking around in the sky.

    Plum Blossom Three Variations: This melody uses the plum blossom's purity, fragrance, and cold resistance to praise people with noble character. The melody's harmonics are repeated three times in different positions, hence the name "Three Variations."

    Ambush from All Sides: This melody depicts the final battle of the Chu-Han Contention in 202 BC at Gaixia. The Han army used the "Ambush from All Sides" formation to defeat the Chu army. Xiang Yu committed suicide at the Wujiang River, and Liu Bang emerged victorious.

    Sunset Flutes and Drums: This is a lyrical and expressive melody with a beautiful and flowing tune. Around 1925, the Shanghai Datong Music Society adapted this melody into a silk and bamboo ensemble piece titled "Spring River and Moonlit Night."

    Fisherman and Woodcutter's Dialogue: This melody has over 30 versions in historical scores, some of which include lyrics. The melody expresses the joy of fishermen and woodcutters in green mountains and clear waters.

    Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute: Based on a poem of the same name, this melody reflects the theme of "Cai Wenji Returning to Han." During the late Han Dynasty, Cai Wenji was stranded in the Southern Xiongnu for 12 years. Although she was married to the Left Worthy King, she deeply missed her homeland. When Cao Cao sent people to bring her back, she was torn between the joy of returning home and the pain of leaving her children, feeling very conflicted.

    Autumn Moon Over the Han Palace: This melody has two popular performance forms: one is a zheng (Chinese zither) piece, and the other is an erhu (two-stringed fiddle) piece. It is said that the erhu piece was passed down by Mr. Liu Tianhua. "Autumn Moon Over the Han Palace" aims to express the sorrow and lament of ancient palace women who were oppressed, evoking sympathy for their unfortunate fate.

    The Sound of Pines: It is said that this melody was composed by Shi Kuang of the state of Jin or Liu Juanzi of the state of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period. The existing lute scores of "The Sound of Pines" and "The Sound of Snow" are two instrumental pieces. "The Sound of Pines" conveys the meaning of all things knowing spring and the wind cleansing, while "The Sound of Snow" conveys the meaning of austerity and purity, with the sound of snow and bamboo.

    我国的十大古曲
    高山流水　传说先秦的琴师伯牙，一次在荒山野地弹琴，樵夫钟子期竟能领会这是描绘的“巍巍乎志在高山”和“洋洋乎志在流水”。伯牙惊曰：“善哉，子之心而与吾心同。”子期死后，伯牙痛失知音，摔琴绝弦，终身不操。故有高山流水之曲。
    广陵散　琴曲。又名《广陵止息》。汉魏时期相和楚调但曲之一。嵇康因反对司马氏专政而遭杀害，临刑前曾从容弹奏此曲以寄托。现存琴谱最早见于《神奇秘谱》。
    平沙落雁　明代此曲称《雁落平沙》。曲调悠扬流畅，通过时隐时现的雁鸣，描写雁群降落前在空际盘旋顾盼的情景。
    梅花三弄　此曲系借物咏怀，通过梅花的洁白、芬芳和耐寒等特征，来赞颂具有高尚节操的人。曲中泛音曲调在不同的徽位上重复了三次，所以称为“三弄”。
    十面埋伏　乐曲描写公元前202年楚汉战争在垓下最后决战的情景。汉军用十面埋伏的阵法击败楚军。项羽自刎于乌江，刘邦取得胜利。
    夕阳箫鼓　这是一首抒情写意的文曲，旋律优美流畅。
    1925年前后，上海大同乐社根据此曲改编成丝竹乐曲《春江花月夜》。
    渔樵问答　此曲在历代传谱中，有30多种版本，有的还附歌词。乐曲表现渔樵在青山绿水间自得其乐的情趣。
    胡笳十八拍　根据同名诗谱写的乐曲，所反映的主题是“文姬归汉”。汉末战乱中，蔡文姬流落到南匈奴达12年之久。她虽身嫁左贤王为妻。然而十分思念故乡。当曹操派人接她回内地时，她又舍不得离开两个孩子，还乡的喜悦被骨肉离别之痛所淹没，心情非常矛盾。
    汉宫秋月　此曲有两种较为流行的演奏形式，一为筝曲，另则为二胡曲。据载，二胡曲是由刘天华先生所传。
    《汉宫秋月》意在表现古代受压迫宫女的幽怨悲泣情绪，唤起人们对她们不幸遭遇的同情。
    阳春白雪　相传这是春秋时期晋国的师旷或齐国的刘涓子所作。
    现存琴谱中的《阳春》和《白雪》是两首器乐曲，《阳春》取万物知春，和风涤荡之意，《白雪》取凛然清洁，雪竹琳琅之音。
