	Where Did the 110,000 Yuan Come From?

	In March of this year, the New Qiu Waste Coal Company of the Fuxin Mining Bureau in Liaoning Province received two remittance notices totaling 110,000 yuan from the First Automobile Works in Changchun. The remittance notice listed the payment as "reimbursement for coal." The Waste Coal Company had always settled coal payments on a daily basis and did not have this debtor. What was going on?

	It turned out that the Waste Coal Company's coal shipments were recorded by the First Automobile Works' electronic scales, which had recorded every extra ton of coal shipped, totaling over 5,000 tons last year, amounting to 110,000 yuan. Even if this amount was not paid, the Waste Coal Company would not have known. However, the First Automobile Works insisted on integrity and sent the payment for the extra tons of coal in full.

	Speaking of the relationship between the Waste Coal Company and the First Automobile Works, one must go back two years. Previously, this company sold coal through various "coal brokers." These "brokers" disregarded ethics and conscience, often mixing inferior coal or coal dust into the shipments, and the quantities were often insufficient, thereby damaging the reputation of the Waste Coal Company and even the Fuxin Mining Bureau. Starting from the beginning of last year, the company decided to handle coal shipments independently and not give the "coal brokers" the green light. They successively signed coal supply contracts with the First Automobile Works, Jincheng Paper Mill, and other units. They upheld integrity, promoted the business philosophy of "more rather than less, better rather than inferior," and won high praise from users.

　　十一万元巨款为何来
    今年3月，辽宁阜新矿务局新邱残采公司陆续收到两笔累计11万元的电汇单，汇款单位是长春第一汽车制造厂，款项名目上写着“补付煤款”。残采公司发煤向来日清月结，根本没有这个债户。这是怎么回事呢？
    原来，残采公司发运的煤炭，“一汽”的电子衡具把每车皮涨吨多出的煤炭一一纪录在册，去年累计达5000多吨，折合人民币11万元。这笔钱即使不付，残采公司也不知道。可是，“一汽”讲信誉，把涨吨煤款如数寄来。
    说起残采公司和“一汽”的关系，还得追述到两年前。以前，这家公司销售煤炭往往由一些“煤倒”发运。这些“倒爷”置道义于不顾，昧良心赚钱，经常往煤炭中掺入次煤或煤泥，数量也往往不足，从而败坏了残采公司乃至阜新矿务局的声誉。从去年初起，这家公司决定自行发运煤炭，不给
  “煤倒”开绿灯。他们先后同
  “一汽”、金城造纸厂等单位签订了供煤合同。他们讲信誉，发扬“宁多毋少，宁好毋次”的优良经营作风，深得用户好评。
