	Adjustment, Rectification, Transformation, and Improvement
	—Important Policies for Promoting the Steady and Healthy Development of Township Enterprises

	People's Daily Commentator

	The rapid growth of China's township enterprises over the past few years has significantly slowed down this year. Reducing the excessively high growth rate, making the product and enterprise structures more rational; easing the pressure on energy and raw materials; reducing waste, and improving efficiency. These measures are not only beneficial for the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy but also for the healthy development of township enterprises themselves. During the entire period of rectification and adjustment, township enterprises must firmly adhere to the policy of "adjustment, rectification, transformation, and improvement."

	The emphasis on adjustment and rectification does not mean to passively restrict the development of township enterprises. The Party Central Committee and the State Council have repeatedly stressed that the policy of encouraging and supporting the development of township enterprises remains unchanged. This point should be reassuring to the broad masses of rural cadres and the people.

	Township enterprises have become an indispensable and important force in China's national economy. Last year, 27.6% of China's total industrial output value was created by township industries; township enterprises earned $8.02 billion in foreign exchange for the country, with exports of clothing alone accounting for 49.6% of the national clothing foreign trade procurement value. Over the past decade, township enterprises have cumulatively paid 114.49 billion yuan in taxes to the state, and from 1985 to 1988, the net increase in state tax revenue was provided by township enterprises by more than half.

	The more important and direct role of township enterprises lies in their support for the modernization of rural areas and agricultural development. Especially in times of national financial difficulties, when it is difficult to allocate more funds to support rural construction and increase agricultural investment, the role of township enterprises becomes even more prominent.

	According to statistics from relevant departments, over the past decade, township enterprises have used 16.28 billion yuan for rural support and construction, equivalent to 35.4% of the state's investment in agriculture during the same period; they have cumulatively provided 68.4 billion yuan for the development of various undertakings in rural areas. Facts from various places show that where township enterprises have developed well, rural education, science and technology, culture, and other undertakings have flourished; agricultural investment has increased, and the level of modernization and intensification of production has improved; the burden on farmers has been reduced, and the relationship between cadres and the masses has also been more harmonious. If we consider its role in arranging employment for more than a billion rural laborers and its contribution to social stability, people will place even greater importance on township enterprises.

	The development of township enterprises has also strengthened the collective economy. In 1988, the total assets of township and village-level enterprises nationwide reached 312.5 billion yuan, including 158.4 billion yuan in fixed assets, which is an important part of China's socialist "assets."

	Precisely because township enterprises occupy such an important position in the national economy and rural economic development, it is necessary to ensure that they develop along a healthy path and cannot be protected simply because of their importance. It must be recognized that due to social and historical reasons, the development of township enterprises indeed has issues such as blind expansion and redundant construction that need attention. There is redundancy with urban enterprises, between different regions, and even within the same region, leading to an irrational product structure and enterprise organizational structure; causing significant waste of energy and raw materials. Some places, influenced by the previous overheated economic environment, have also shown a tendency to expand investment indiscriminately and set up new ventures. In addition, a considerable number of enterprises have different degrees of problems in management, product quality, energy and raw material consumption, and pollution. It is from this reality that the Party Central Committee and the State Council have formulated the policy of "adjustment, rectification, transformation, and improvement," determined to guide township enterprises onto a more healthy development path.

	This is a positive policy for the long-term development of township enterprises. Various places should correctly understand this and enthusiastically guide township enterprises to actively adjust their product and industrial structures according to the overall needs of the national economic rectification and adjustment, seriously rectify their business practices, actively transform outdated equipment and production methods, and strive to improve management and technological levels.

	During the rectification, it is important to adhere to practicality, follow industrial policies, and implement a policy of both support and restraint, avoiding a "one-size-fits-all" approach. Enterprises that directly serve agriculture, serve large-scale industries and provide supporting services, earn foreign exchange through exports and the "two ends out" model, as well as enterprises with marketable products, should continue to be supported and should not be overlooked simply because they are "township" enterprises. For those that are truly operating without resources, competing with large enterprises for raw materials, wasting resources, having no benefits, causing serious environmental pollution, or having products with no market, it is necessary to resolutely "close, stop, merge, and transform." Delaying decisions will only cause more chaos. Hesitation and indecision will miss the opportunity and result in greater economic losses.

	In the future, it is necessary to encourage and guide township enterprises to develop in the direction of being based on agricultural and sideline products and local raw materials, leveraging the advantages of labor-intensive and traditional crafts, and serving and supporting large-scale industries. Only by meeting the needs of the overall urban-rural economic layout can township enterprises have deep roots and a bright future.

	It is necessary to have such confidence: as long as the policy of "adjustment, rectification, transformation, and improvement" is seriously implemented, China's township enterprises will definitely develop in a healthier and more vigorous manner, making greater contributions to the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the entire national economy.

    调整  整顿  改造  提高
　　——促进乡镇企业稳步健康发展的重要方针
    本报评论员
    连续多年高速增长的我国乡镇企业，今年以来发展速度已明显回落。把过高的速度降下来，使产品和企业结构更加合理；减轻能源、原材料压力；减少浪费，提高效益。这样做不仅对整个国民经济的持续稳定协调发展有利，而且对乡镇企业自身健康发展也有利。在整个治理整顿期间，乡镇企业要坚定不移地贯彻“调整、整顿、改造、提高”的方针。
    讲调整、整顿并不是要消极地限制乡镇企业的发展。党中央、国务院一再重申，鼓励和扶持乡镇企业发展的政策不变。这一点请广大农村干部、群众放心。
    乡镇企业已成为我国国民经济中一支无法取代的重要力量。去年，我国工业总产值的27.6％是乡镇工业创造的；乡镇企业为国家创汇80.2亿美元，仅出口服装就占全国服装外贸收购额的49.6％。乡镇企业10年来累计向国家纳税1144.9亿元，1985年到1988年，国家税收净增部分，乡镇企业提供的占一半多。
    乡镇企业更重要和直接的作用还在于对农村现代化建设和农业发展的支持。特别是在国家财政困难，难以拿出更多钱支援农村建设、增加农业投入的情况下，乡镇企业的作用就愈显突出。
    据有关方面统计，近10年乡镇企业用于补农、建农的资金达162.8亿元，相当于同期国家对农业投资的35.4％；累计向农村各项事业提供发展资金684亿元。各地事实表明，凡是乡镇企业发展较好的地方，农村的教育、科技、文化等各项事业都蓬勃发展；农业投入增加，生产现代化、集约化程度提高；农民负担减轻，干群关系也较融洽。如果考虑到它在安排农村上亿劳动力就业对社会安定所起的作用，人们就会更加看重乡镇企业。
    乡镇企业的发展还壮大了集体经济的力量。1988年，全国属乡、村两级所有的资产达3125亿元，其中固定资产1584亿元，这是我国社会主义“家当”中的重要部分。
    正因为乡镇企业在国民经济，在农村经济发展中占有如此重要的位置，所以必须保证它沿着健康的轨道不断发展，不能因爱其深而护其短。必须看到，由于社会和历史的原因，乡镇企业的发展确实存在着盲目上马、重复建设等值得注意的另一面。与城市企业重复，不同地区间的重复，以及同一地区内的重复都存在，带来产品结构和企业组织结构不尽合理；造成了能源和原材料的很大浪费。还有一些地方受前一段经济大环境过热的影响，也出现了一味扩大投资，滥铺新摊子的倾向。此外，相当一部分企业在管理、产品质量、能源和原材料消耗以及污染等方面不同程度地存在着问题。正是从这种实际出发，党中央、国务院制定了“调整、整顿、改造、提高”的方针，决心把乡镇企业引上更加健康发展的轨道。
    这对乡镇企业的长远发展是一个积极的方针。对此，各地要正确理解，要热情引导乡镇企业切实按照国民经济治理整顿的全局需要，主动调整产品和产业结构，认真整顿经营作风，积极改造落后设备和生产手段，努力提高管理和技术水平。
    在整顿中，要坚持从实际出发，依据产业政策，实行有保有压，不搞“一刀切”。对那些直接为农业服务的企业，为大工业服务、配套的企业，出口创汇和“两头在外”的企业，以及产品适销对路的企业，要继续扶持，不能因其姓“乡”就轻视。对那些确实搞无米之炊的，与大企业争原材料、浪费严重、没有效益的以及对环境污染严重，或者产品没有销路的企业，要下决心“关、停、并、转”。当断不断，反受其乱。犹豫不决，贻误时机，会造成更大经济损失。
    今后，要鼓励和引导乡镇企业沿着立足于农副产品和本地原材料，发挥劳动密集和传统工艺的优势，为大工业服务和配套的方向发展。符合城乡经济总格局的需要，乡镇企业才能根深叶茂，前途广阔。
    应当树立这样的信心，只要认真贯彻“调整、整顿、改造、提高”的方针，我国的乡镇企业就一定能够更加健康、更加朝气蓬勃地发展起来，为整个国民经济的持续、稳定、协调发展作出更大贡献。
