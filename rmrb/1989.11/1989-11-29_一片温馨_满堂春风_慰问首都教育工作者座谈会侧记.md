On November 14, winter arrived in Beijing, with the lowest outdoor temperature dropping to minus 3 degrees Celsius. However, the Yunnan Hall in the Great Hall of the People was as warm as spring.

A meaningful symposium was taking place here – the Symposium to Comfort the Capital's Educators.

Representatives of the capital's teachers came;

Wang Ping, a member of the Central Advisory Commission and a veteran of many battles, came, as did the silver-haired Rong Gaotang;

News reporters came...

The symposium was jointly organized by the *Science and Technology Daily*, the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau, and the Nanjing Rapid Hot Water Heater Factory.

Wang Ping was the oldest and most respected comrade at the symposium. He was famous during the Korean War, but today he was particularly humble. He said: The people in our society who should be most respected are the teachers. So, when I heard about this symposium, I came happily.

The elderly sports veteran Rong Gaotang had a radiant face. He stood up and bowed respectfully to the teachers present. He said: "Each of us has a childhood and youth. I will never forget the teachers who nurtured me. I want to pay my respects to the teachers present and to all teachers across the country." He then added: "Today's symposium is organized by media and enterprises, which is great. The media and entrepreneurs are all paying attention to teachers, making things easier."

The responsible person from the *Science and Technology Daily* said: Science and technology cannot do without education, and the media cannot do without education. Education is the foundation. Our newspaper will strengthen the propaganda of education in the future and improve the social status of teachers.

The deputy factory director of the Nanjing Rapid Hot Water Heater Factory, Zhang Guangtai, said: The country needs construction, construction needs talents, and talents need education. Our country's teachers have worked tirelessly to cultivate talents for the country, and they have deeply impressed us. I represent all 1600 employees of the factory to pay our respects to the teachers.

A small gift, a heart full of gratitude. To show a little respect to the teachers, the factory did a good deed for some educators in the capital by providing 100 rapid hot water heaters at a discount and free installation service.

To produce these rapid hot water heaters, the entire factory mobilized. They carefully crafted and strictly inspected each hot water heater to ensure quality; then they rushed to Beijing day and night to install them for the teachers.

The teachers present could no longer suppress their excitement.

The representative of the teachers from Beijing Shijia Hutong Primary School said: Today's symposium shows that we teachers are respected by all sides. We will definitely cultivate the country's flowers with our actual actions.

The elderly educator from Beijing, Zhou Zheng, said: My family has a hot water heater. It not only provides hot water but also a warm current.

Yes, this is a warm current of respect from millions of people for the teachers. The water is hot, and the hearts are even hotter.

　　一片温馨　满堂春风
　　——慰问首都教育工作者座谈会侧记
　　本报记者　刘燮阳
    11月14日，隆冬降临北京，室外最低温度已下降到零下3度，而人民大会堂云南厅里却依然温暖如春。
    这里正在举行一个有意义的座谈会——慰问首都教育工作者座谈会。
    首都的教师代表来了；
    中顾委委员、身经百战的王平同志来了，满头银发的荣高棠同志来了；
    新闻记者来了……
    座谈会是由《科技日报》社、北京市教育局和南京快速热水器总厂共同主办的。
    王平是座谈会中年纪最大、最受尊敬的老同志，他在抗美援朝时赫赫有名，今天却特别谦虚。他说：我们的社会最应当受到尊重的是教师，所以我一听到开这样的座谈会，就很高兴地来了。
    体育界的老前辈荣高棠满面红光，他站起来，毕恭毕敬地向在座的教师鞠了一个躬。他说：“我们每个人都有童年和青年时代，我忘不了培养我的老师，我要向在座的老师致敬，向全国的老师致敬。”接着，他又说：今天这个座谈会由新闻单位和企业来主办，太好了，舆论界、企业家都来重视教师，事情就好办了。
    《科技日报》的负责人说：科技离不开教育，舆论也离不开教育，教育是根本，我们报纸今后要大力加强教育的宣传，提高教师的社会地位。
    南京快速热水器总厂副厂长曾光泰说：国家富强需要建设，建设需要人才，人才需要教育。我国的教师为国家培养人才呕心沥血，默默地奉献，他们深深刻印在我们心中，我代表全厂1600名职工向教师们致敬。
    千里送鹅毛，礼轻情义重。为了向老师们表示一点敬意，这个厂给首都部分教育工作者办了一件实事，优惠提供100台快速热水器，免费上门安装服务。
    为了赶制这些快速热水器，工厂上下都动起来了。他们精心制作，严格把关，使每一台快速热水器都能达到优质；接着又日夜兼程赶到北京，为老师们安装。
    在座的老师再也抑制不住内心的激动。
    北京史家胡同小学教师的代表说：今天的座谈会表明，我们老师受到各方面的尊重，我们一定用实际行动，培养好祖国的花朵。
    北京市老教育工作者周正同志说：我家里用上了热水器，它流出来的不仅是热水，而是一股温暖的热流。
    是的，这是一股千百万人对老师尊重的热流。水热、心更热。
