Title: Why Has the Incentive Effect Weakened?

	Currently, many people are calling out: rewards can no longer effectively motivate people's enthusiasm, and punishments cannot effectively restrain people's misconduct. In short, the incentive effect is weakening.

	Incentives are measures taken by organizers in a planned manner (including rewards and punishments) to stimulate members of the system, causing internal psychological changes, making them produce the behavioral responses expected by the organizers, and ultimately achieving the predetermined goals. Specifically, rewards can motivate people's enthusiasm and creativity, help people form good moral qualities, and promote the improvement of social ethics. Punishments, on the other hand, can increase the variability of people's behavior, change their ways, avoid repeating mistakes, warn the punished, educate others, and have a restraining effect on all members of the system. Wherever there are groups of people, management is indispensable, and effective management methods include rewards and punishments. To achieve effective social management, stimulate social vitality, ensure social order, and enhance and strengthen the incentive effect is very important.

	Where does the weakening of the incentive effect come from?

	Firstly, excessive rewards and punishments weaken the attractiveness or deterrence of incentives. Rewards are a positive affirmation of people's good behavior or achievements. The standards for rewards are not something anyone can arbitrarily set. However, currently, activities to evaluate and reward outstanding individuals are too frequent, and the standards are lowered. At the end of last year, the second national television quality evaluation, the first-class award-winning products reached 61, while the number of television factories in China is only a few dozen. This means that almost every factory can bring back one or two "first-class awards." Just as the news of "61 first places" was spreading, some local consumer associations statistics showed that in 1988, the number of user complaints about television quality increased by 3.5 times compared to the previous year. No wonder people exclaimed: some "famous and excellent products" have become "public concerns"! There are similar phenomena regarding punishments: many enterprises have formulated a large number of fines, and workers see warning signs for fines everywhere as soon as they enter the factory, making people at a loss. Moreover, the more punishment clauses there are, the harder they are to enforce. On the contrary, people form a rebellious and indifferent psychology, and the positive role of punishment is naturally difficult to achieve.

	Secondly, rewards and punishments lack correspondence, are not implemented, and reduce people's trust in incentives. For example, some enterprises implement contract leasing, and it is correct to reward those who make a profit. However, when there is a loss, especially economic compensation, it is often not done, and some simply transfer the contract leasing person to another position. Over time, who will still believe in the effect of incentives?

	Thirdly, rewards and punishments are based on experience or personal will, reducing the legal nature of incentives. Currently, in many places, rewards and punishments are not based on laws, but entirely on the personal judgment of leaders or executors. Therefore, some leaders or executors often use their power for personal gain, turning rewards and punishments into a tool to win hearts or retaliate against workers. The legal nature of rewards and punishments requires that the entire process of rewards and punishments be regulated by legislative procedures and ensured by legal means. Only in this way can the seriousness and stability of rewards and punishments be guaranteed, playing a role in promoting social development and ensuring social order.

	The positive role of incentives is obvious, but if not implemented properly, it will produce negative effects. This social problem should be taken seriously. Recently, the Party Central Committee has required to focus on spiritual civilization construction and strengthen ideological and political work, which is a good opportunity to study and solve the problem of "weakened incentive effect." We should summarize the successful experiences and lessons of past rewards and punishments, making the incentive mechanism play a positive role in reform and opening up and modernization construction.

### 激励效应为什么减弱了？

　　激励效应为什么减弱了？
　　赵振宇
    时下，不少人都在疾呼：奖励已不能很好地调动人们的积极性，惩罚也不能有效地制约人们的越轨和不当行为。一句话，激励效应在减弱。
    激励，是组织者采取有计划的措施（包括奖励和惩罚），对系统成员施以刺激，引起内部的心理变化，使之产生组织者所期望的行为反应，以便达到预定目标的手段。具体来说，奖励可以调动人们的积极性、创造性，促使人们形成良好的道德品质，促使整个社会风气的好转。而惩罚则能增强人们行为的变异性，改弦更张，不蹈覆辙，警戒受罚者，教育其他人，对整个系统成员起到制约作用。凡有人群的地方就少不了管理，而管理的有效方法包括奖励和惩罚。为了实现有效的社会管理，激发社会活力，保障社会正常秩序，发挥和增强激励效应是十分重要的。
    目前激励效应减弱的原因在哪里呢？
    其一，奖励滥、惩罚滥，减弱了激励的吸引力或威慑力。奖励是对人们良好行为或成果的一种积极肯定的信息反馈。奖励的标准不是任何人都可以随意提出的。而现在，评先进、奖优秀活动过于频繁，标准降低。去年底，第二届全国彩电质量评比，一等奖产品竟达61个之多，而我国目前生产彩电的厂家也不过几十家。这就意味着差不多每个厂家都可以搬回一至两个“一等奖”。就在“61个第一”喜讯频传的时候，一些地方的消费者协会统计表明，1988年用户对彩电质量的投诉信，比上年增长了3.5倍。无怪乎人们惊呼：某些“名优产品”成了“民忧产品”！关于惩罚也有类似现象：不少企业制定了大量罚款条例，工人一进厂，处处都可以看到引人注目的罚款牌，搞得人们无所措手足。而且，惩罚条例一多，也不易执行。相反，人们形成了逆反和无所谓心理，惩罚的积极作用自然也就难以达到了。
    其二，奖惩无对应性，不兑现，减弱了人们对激励的信任度。如有的企业搞承包租赁，盈利了受到嘉奖是正确的，但亏损了应受到处罚特别是经济赔偿却常常不能做到，有的是将承包租赁者调任他职了事。长此以往，人们有谁还会相信激励的作用呢？
    其三，奖惩凭经验或个人意志办事，降低了激励的法制性。现在不少地方奖惩无法，全凭领导者或执行者个人决断。因而，一些领导者或执行者常常以权谋私，把奖惩作为笼络人心或打击报复职工的一个法宝。奖惩的法制性要求赏罚的全过程必须以立法程序予以规定，用法律手段保证其正确执行。只有这样才能保证奖惩的严肃性和稳定性，起到促进社会发展和保障社会正常秩序的作用。
    激励的积极作用是显而易见的，但实行不好，反而会产生副作用。这一社会问题应引起重视。最近，党中央要求抓紧精神文明建设，加强思想政治工作，这是研究、解决“激励效应减弱”的一个极好时机。我们应该总结以往奖惩的成功经验和失败教训，使激励机制在改革开放和现代化建设中发挥积极效应。
