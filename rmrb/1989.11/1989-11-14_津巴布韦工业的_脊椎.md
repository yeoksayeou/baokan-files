    The Spine of Zimbabwe's Industry
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Shēn Mínghé

    "If you come to Zimbabwe and only visit Harare without going to Bulawayo, it's like coming to China and only visiting Beijing without going to Shanghai. You will feel regret," a Zimbabwean colleague told us. This shows the importance of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe.

    Under the arrangement of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce, we visited Bulawayo. This is a historic city with a glorious tradition of opposing colonialism. The original residents were mainly the hardworking and brave Matabele people.

    In the late 19th century, British colonialists, in order to invade Zimbabwe, organized mercenaries in three directions to attack Bulawayo in 1893. The Matabele warriors bravely resisted, suffering heavy casualties, and were eventually forced to retreat from Bulawayo. When the British cavalry entered the city, Bulawayo was left in ruins. The leader of British colonialism, Cecil Rhodes, after occupying the entire Zimbabwe, named the area "Rhodesia" after himself. Before his death, he designated that he would be buried on a rocky peak in the scenic Matopos Hills, 30 kilometers away from Bulawayo, so that he could forever overlook this fertile colony. However, Rhodes' beautiful dream was ultimately shattered by Zimbabwe's independence.

    Bulawayo is located in the southwestern border region, with a population of 600,000. It has a developed industry and is also a railway hub. Factories are scattered around the city, including 265 manufacturing enterprises such as machinery, automobiles, electromechanical, rubber, copper smelting, electronics, knitting, wood, and footwear. The annual output value is over a billion dollars. In addition to meeting domestic market needs, some products are also exported to neighboring countries. Some high-end products are even sold to Western Europe and the United States. Therefore, many people call Bulawayo the "spine of Zimbabwe's industry."

    Here, we visited the country's largest locomotive and vehicle factory. In the spacious workshop, we saw workers of different skin colors working diligently. According to the factory's technical advisor, Mr. Peter, the factory treats both black and white employees equally. The monthly salary for ordinary workers is 200-400 Zimbabwe dollars (2 Zimbabwe dollars equal 1 US dollar), for technical workers it is 400-1200 Zimbabwe dollars, for technical personnel it is 1200-2000 Zimbabwe dollars, and for management personnel it is 3000 Zimbabwe dollars. Mr. Peter took us to visit the railway training center and told us that the factory attaches great importance to personnel training. The trainees include managers, secretaries, drivers, electricians, and machinists. The modern teaching equipment and library in the training center left a deep impression on us.

    At the Lawrance Engineering Company, we were warmly received by the young manager, Mr. John. The company has a large team of technical personnel, mainly responsible for designing and constructing roads and bridges, with construction projects both domestically and in neighboring countries. Mr. John showed us many photos taken at the construction sites, indicating that the company's business is thriving. During the conversation, this young and shrewd manager said to us, "We also learn from you, to open up more avenues and diversify our operations. To expand our business and meet market demands, we have set up a furniture factory and a small hardware factory..." When he led us to visit the new factory area, he mentioned that he was born in this city as a white youth and believed that it was precisely because black and white people got along harmoniously and contributed together that the stable environment was created, allowing Bulawayo's industry to develop rapidly.

    During the interview, the factory workers' committee aroused our great interest. According to the introduction, the workers' committee was directly elected from the workers in 1980. Its main tasks are to represent the workers in negotiations with the management, to mediate and resolve labor disputes; to assist the factory in training workers; and the factory needs to obtain the approval of the workers' committee when hiring new workers or dismissing workers. Under the promotion of the workers' committee, the workers' living conditions have been improved, and at the same time, the workers' enthusiasm has been mobilized, thereby promoting the development of production.

    As the day's interview ended, Bulawayo was already lit up with lights. We took the train back to the capital, Harare, but the words of our Bulawayo friends still echoed in our ears: "What controls our fate is tomorrow, not yesterday... because we already have a new generation. We must keep moving forward and make tomorrow better!"

    津巴布韦工业的“脊椎”
    本报记者　申明河
      “到津巴布韦，只看哈拉雷而不到布拉瓦约，就等于到了中国只看北京而不到上海一样，会感到遗憾的，”津巴布韦一位同行对我们说。可见，布拉瓦约在津巴布韦占有何等的地位。
    在津巴布韦全国工业联合会的安排下，我们访问了布拉瓦约。这是一座历史名城，有着反对殖民主义的光荣传统。市内居民原大都是勤劳勇敢的马塔贝莱族。
    19世纪末，英国殖民者为侵占津巴布韦，于1893年组织雇佣军分三路进犯布拉瓦约。马塔贝莱族战士奋起抗击，伤亡惨重，最后被迫退出布拉瓦约。当英国骑兵入城时，布拉瓦约只剩一片废墟。英国殖民主义者的头目西赛尔·罗得斯占领整个津巴布韦后，遂以他的名字把这个地区命名为“罗得西亚”。他临终前还指定日后把他安葬在离布拉瓦约30公里的风景秀丽的马托普斯山一岩石之巅，以便他永远俯视这片富饶的殖民地。但是，罗得斯的黄粱美梦终因津巴布韦的独立而破灭。
    布拉瓦约地处西南边陲，人口60万，工业发达，又是铁路枢纽。市郊工厂林立，有机械制造、汽车、机电、橡胶、炼铜、电子、针织、木材、制鞋等265家工厂企业，每年产值上亿美元。产品除供国内市场需要外，还出口到邻国。有些高档产品远销西欧和美国。所以，不少人称布拉瓦约为“津巴布韦工业的脊椎”。
    在这里，我们参观了全国最大的机车车辆厂。在宽敞的车间，只见不同肤色的工人在紧张地劳动。据厂部技术顾问彼得先生介绍说，工厂对无论是黑人还是白人职工都一视同仁。普通工人月薪为200—400津元（2津元等于1美元），技术工人为400—1200津元，技术人员1200—2000津元，管理人员3000津元。彼得先生带我们参观了铁路培训中心，告诉我们，工厂很重视人员培训。对象是管理人员、秘书、司机、电工和车工等。培训中心的现代化电教设备和图书馆等给我们留下颇深印象。
    在劳尔万斯工程公司，我们受到年轻经理约翰先生的热情接待。该公司有一支巨大的技术人员队伍，主要任务是负责设计和承建道路桥梁，在国内和邻国都有承建业务。约翰先生向我们展示了许多在工程现场拍摄的照片，表明该公司的业务兴旺发达。交谈中，这位年轻、精明的经理对我们说：“我们也向你们学习，要广开门路，多种经营。为扩大业务，适应市场的需要，我们建起家具厂和小五金厂……”他在带领我们参观新厂区时谈到，他是在本市出生的白人青年，并认为，正是由于黑人和白人和睦相处，共同奉献，才有了安定的环境，布拉瓦约的工业才得以迅速发展。
    采访中，工厂工人委员会引起我们颇大的兴趣。据介绍，工人委员会是1980年从工人中直接选举产生的。其主要任务是，代表工人同资方谈判，调解和处理劳资纠纷；协助工厂对工人进行技术培训；厂方吸收新工人或解雇工人，需征得工人委员会同意。在工人委员会的推动下，工人生活福利得到较好的改善，同时又调动了工人的积极性，从而促进了生产的发展。
    一天的采访结束时，布拉瓦约已是万家灯火。我们搭乘火车返回首都哈拉雷，但布拉瓦约朋友的话语仍久久回响在耳边：“主宰我们命运的是明天而不是昨天……因为我们已有了一代新人。我们要不断前进，让明天更美好！”
