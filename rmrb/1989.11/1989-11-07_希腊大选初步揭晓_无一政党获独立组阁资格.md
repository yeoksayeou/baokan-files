Xinhua News Agency, Athens, November 6th

The preliminary results of the Greek elections, announced this morning at 1:50 AM by the Greek Ministry of the Interior, indicate that no single party has secured the necessary seats to form an independent cabinet. This has led to a complex political situation in Greece.

According to the statistics from 15,094 out of 16,584 polling stations, the New Democracy Party obtained 46.4% of the votes, securing 184 seats. The Panhellenic Socialist Movement, which lost in the June elections, garnered 40.8% of the votes and 128 seats. The United Left Progressive Alliance received 10.8% of the votes and 21 seats. The remaining parties secured 2% of the votes and 3 seats.

Although the New Democracy Party increased its vote share by 2.7% compared to the June elections, it did not secure more than half of the 300 seats in the parliament, thus failing to achieve its pre-election goal of forming an independent cabinet. The leader of the New Democracy Party, Mitsotakis, stated that he aims to form a coalition government within three days.

    希腊大选初步揭晓
    无一政党获独立组阁资格
    新华社雅典11月6日电  据今晨1点50分希腊内政部公布的初步统计结果，在5日举行的希腊今年第二次大选中无一政党获得独立组阁资格，从而使希腊政局出现复杂局面。
    对16584投票站中15094投票站的统计结果表明，新民主党获得46.4％的选票，获184议席。6月大选中失败的泛希腊社会主义运动获得40.8％，128席。左翼进步联盟获10.8％，21席。其余各党获2％，3个议席。
    新民主党虽然比6月大选增加了2.7％的选票，但没有获得议会中300席中半数以上的席位，从而未能实现大选前提出的独立组阁的目标。新民主党领袖米佐塔基斯表示，要在3天内组成联合政府。
