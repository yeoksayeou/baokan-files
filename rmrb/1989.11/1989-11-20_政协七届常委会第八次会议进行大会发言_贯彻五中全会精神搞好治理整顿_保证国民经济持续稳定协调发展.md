The second plenary session of the eighth meeting of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was held this morning in the Great Hall of the People. Committee members discussed how to implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), further stabilize and develop China's political and economic situation, and ensure the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy.

Feng Ti-yun, a member of the Standing Committee, said that the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Rectification and Deepening of Reform" emphasizes that future economic development must adhere to the principles of "sustained," "stable," and "coordinated" development. This is a precious experience gained over the past 40 years of economic construction in China, and it is the guarantee for our future victories. As long as we adhere to and implement this principle, China's economy will definitely return to a healthy development track. He said that the "Decision" clearly states that those who do not follow orders, do not stop when prohibited, have countermeasures against policies, or even secretly disobey and refuse to implement them must be severely criticized. Those with serious offenses must be subject to disciplinary actions. For a country as large as ours, historical experience has proven that only unity brings strength, and unity brings national strength. If there are situations of each doing their own thing, decentralized management, and each acting independently, the consequences are unimaginable. The prestige and strength of the Communist Party come from its iron discipline, and this must not be relaxed.

Fang Rongxin, a member of the Standing Committee, said that it is necessary to correctly assess and analyze the economic situation, further unify understanding, and resolutely carry out rectification and deepen reform. In urban and rural grassroots levels and among the broad masses, efforts should be made to learn and implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee and the "Decision," and continue to conduct education on the situation, patriotism, collectivism, and socialism. The focus should be on stability and encouragement; guiding the masses to see achievements and bright prospects, seeing favorable conditions, alleviating and eliminating grievances and dissatisfaction, and enhancing the courage and determination to overcome difficulties. At the same time, the spirit of self-reliance, hard work, and thrift should be deeply ingrained, and extravagance and wasteful consumption should be curbed.

Fang Rongxin hopes that the spirit of hard work, selfless dedication, and wholeheartedly serving the people can be advocated again. He said that a nation, a country, and an individual, if they want to stand up and achieve something, must have a spirit and a will. Economic takeoff without hard work is empty talk. In the new historical conditions, we must continue to carry forward the spirit of our people who are not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of pressure, self-reliant, and hardworking.

Tang Yuanbin, a member of the Standing Committee, spoke about township enterprises, saying that they should not be dealt with in a one-size-fits-all manner, but should be actively adjusted, with some being strengthened and others being eliminated. The Party Central Committee has repeatedly emphasized that the policy of reform and opening up will not change. This is a major premise for adjustment. Township enterprises have become the cause of 800 million farmers and are a promising cause, a product of reform and opening up since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. As long as reform and opening up do not change, township enterprises will definitely continue to develop. We should seize the favorable opportunity to actively adjust under the guidance of national macro-control and industrial policies. Each locality should, according to the structural contradictions exposed, plan and rhythmically adjust, optimize the structure, and reorganize new advantages by industry and region to find new ways. All township enterprises should also deepen enterprise reform and improve the operating mechanism, improving and enhancing the quality of the enterprise in various aspects.

Sun Tingfang, a member of the Standing Committee, said at the meeting that hard work, thrift, independence, and self-reliance are the fine traditions of our party and people. These patriotic education is the foundation of our country. In recent years, due to our mistakes in education, patriotic education has been less emphasized, and national pride has been weakened. Under the influence of high-consumption ideology and the worship of foreign things, imported goods have flooded the market, and foreign cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, drinks, cosmetics, medicines, and other products are everywhere. In the industrial sector, production lines for repeated imports such as televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, computers, car assembly, and easy-open cans are found in every major city. Not only does this waste a large amount of national foreign exchange, but it also seriously damages the development of national industries, which is deeply regrettable.

He said that the formation of these problems is quite complex, involving the need for exchanges after opening up, the gap in the quality of domestic goods, and the profit-making nature of selling imported goods. But the key is that the worship of foreign things is at work in people's minds, and the spirit of hard work and self-reliance has been weakened. He proposed that in response to the above problems of the proliferation of foreign goods and repeated imports, supporting the continuous development of domestic national industries, it is necessary to solve these problems in a timely manner by combining ideological and political work with administrative management. Ideological and political work must propagate patriotism, hard work, thrift, independence, and self-reliance; administrative legislation must stipulate that imported projects must highlight technology, management, funds, and repayment characteristics, otherwise, they will not be imported.

Zhang Guangdou, a member of the Standing Committee, in his speech, appealed to the central and local governments to fully pay attention to the basic construction of water resources. He said that China's water resources are scarce, and the water resources in North China, Northwest China, and Northeast China are particularly tense. Agriculture needs water, and industry and cities also need water. Currently, the phenomenon of competition for water between agriculture and industry is quite prominent. Agriculture often encounters droughts, while industrial and urban water use is very difficult. Cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, Taiyuan, and Datong all lack water. In developed countries, industrial and urban water use accounts for about 45% to 50% of the total water use, while in China, it only accounts for a few percent.

He said that developing water sources, saving water, and treating freshwater are urgent tasks. He called for water resources construction to be listed as a strategic focus of national economic construction, along with energy and transportation, and for water conservancy economic reform to be adjusted, so that whoever uses water, bears the cost. He urged the development of water sources, saving water, treating sewage, and preventing floods.

Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, Zhao Pu-chu, presided over the morning session of the meeting. Members of the Standing Committee such as Shen Yuan, Lu Rongshu, and Liang Yuning also spoke at the meeting.

    政协七届常委会第八次会议进行大会发言
    贯彻五中全会精神搞好治理整顿  保证国民经济持续稳定协调发展
    新华社北京11月19日电  政协第七届全国委员会常务委员会第八次会议今天上午在全国政协礼堂举行第二次全体会议。委员们就如何贯彻中共十三届五中全会精神，进一步稳定和发展我国的政治经济形势，保证国民经济持续、稳定、协调发展等问题，进行了大会发言。
    冯梯云常委说，《中共中央关于进一步治理整顿和深化改革的决定》中提到的今后经济的发展必须坚持“持续”、“稳定”、“协调”的方针，是我国四十年来经济建设中付出了重大代价才取得的宝贵经验，是我们取得今后胜利的保证。只要按此方针贯彻落实，我国的经济一定能够走上健康发展的轨道。他说，《决定》中已提到对于有令不行，有禁不止，上有政策，下有对策，甚至阳奉阴违，顶着不办的，都必须给予严肃批评，情节严重的必须给予党纪政纪处分。对于我们这样一个大国，历史的经验证明，只有统一才有力量，统一才能带来国力。如果出现各搞各的、多头分散、各自为政的情况，其后果是不堪设想的。共产党的威望和力量是来自铁的纪律，这一点千万松不得。
    方荣欣常委说，必须在正确估量、分析经济形势的基础上，进一步把认识统一到坚定不移地搞好治理整顿，深化改革上来。在城乡基层和广大群众中，要配合学习、贯彻五中全会精神和决定，继续进行形势教育和爱国主义、集体主义、社会主义教育。着眼于稳定，着眼于鼓劲；引导群众看到成绩和光明，看到有利条件，缓解、消除埋怨和不满情绪，增强克服困难的勇气和决心，同时使自力更生，艰苦创业和过几年紧日子的思想深入人心，抑制铺张浪费现象和超前消费意识。
    方荣欣希望现在能重新提倡艰苦奋斗、无私奉献，全心全意为人民服务的精神。他说，一个民族，一个国家，一个人，要想站立起来，有所作为，必须有一点精神，有一股志气。经济腾飞离开艰苦奋斗便是空话。在新的历史条件下，要继续弘扬我国人民不畏难，不怕压，自力更生，艰苦奋斗的民族精神。
    汤元炳常委在谈到乡镇企业时说，对待乡镇企业不能“一刀切”，而是要积极调整，有上有下，有保有压，有加强有淘汰。党中央一再指出改革开放的政策不变。这是调整的一个大前提。乡镇企业已成为8亿农民的事业，而且是大有希望的事业，是十一届三中全会以来改革开放的产物，只要改革开放不变，乡镇企业就必然要继续发展，应该抓紧有利时机，在国家宏观控制和产业政策的指导下，自觉地、积极地进行调整。各地要根据暴露出来的结构性矛盾，有计划、有节奏地通过调整，优化结构，按行业按地区重新组织新的优势，走出新的路子。所有乡镇企业同样要深化企业改革，完善经营机制。提高和改善企业各方面的素质。
    孙廷芳常委在会上说，艰苦朴素、勤俭建国、独立自主、自力更生是我们党和人民的优良传统。这些爱国主义教育是我们立国之本，近几年来由于我们在教育问题上的失误，爱国主义讲得少了，民族自尊心削弱了。在高消费思想影响下，崇洋思想的影响下，使进口货充斥市场，外烟、洋酒、洋饮料、进口化妆品、药品等到处皆是；工业方面重复引进生产线，电视机、电冰箱、洗衣机、空调机、计算机、汽车装配、易拉罐等生产线，各大城市都有。不但浪费国家大量外汇，而且又严重损害民族工业的发展，大家对此深感痛心。
    他说，这些问题的形成十分复杂，有开放后交际的需要，有国货质量上的差距，有贩卖进口货有利可图等因素。但关键是人们头脑里的崇洋思想作怪，艰苦朴素、自力更生思想的削弱。他提出，针对以上存在的洋货的泛滥和重复的引进，支持国内民族工业的不断发展，必须从思想政治工作和行政管理结合来及时解决这些问题。思想政治工作必须宣传爱国主义，宣传艰苦朴素、勤俭建国、独立自主、自力更生的精神；行政法制中要规定引进项目必须突出技术、管理、资金和返销的特色，否则决不引进。
    张光斗常委在发言中吁请中央和地方充分重视水资源的基础建设。他说，我国水源紧缺，华北、西北、东北水资源十分紧张。农业需要水，工业和城市也需要水。目前工农业争水的现象已十分突出。农业常遇干旱，而工业和城市用水很困难，北京、天津、青岛、大连、太原、大同等城市都缺水。发达国家的工业和城市用水约占总用水量的45％至50％，而我国只占百分之十几。
    他说，开发水源、节约用水和淡水处理，是当务之急。他呼吁，把水资源建设像能源、交通等一样列为国家经济建设的战略重点，并且调整水利经济改革，做到谁用水，谁负担，抓紧开发水源，节约用水，处理污水，同时抓紧防治洪水。
    全国政协副主席赵朴初主持了上午的大会。沈元、陆榕树、梁裕宁等常委也在会上发了言。
