This year, the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission have taken the cleanup of officials and staff members' illegal land occupation and private housing construction as a major task to combat corruption and promote party discipline and clean governance, achieving remarkable results.

Statistics show that since 1987, the province has seen 25,137 cases of illegal land occupation and private housing construction, covering 4495.25 acres. Among these, 14,000 cases involved party and government officials and staff, occupying 1,700 acres of land. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have decided to tackle the cleanup of illegal private housing construction to correct this wrong trend.

In July, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government issued a special notice to the entire province regarding the cleanup of illegal private housing construction. The province established a leading group headed by Governor Wang Chaowen and Discipline Inspection Commission Secretary Liu Hanqing to oversee the cleanup. Local governments at all levels also established leading groups and offices to implement the responsibility system. For cases confirmed to be illegal, appropriate measures such as demolition, confiscation, or fines will be taken based on the severity of the offense. Those who used their power for personal gain or misused public resources will be required to return the money, pay back the costs, and compensate for the interest. Legal and disciplinary actions will also be taken against those involved in illegal activities. For those who voluntarily admit their mistakes, demolish the structures, and return the money, lighter penalties or exemptions will be considered.

    惩腐倡廉拿出过硬措施
    贵州着力清理干部违纪建私房
    本报讯　今年以来，贵州省委、省纪委把清理干部职工违法违章违纪占地建私房作为惩治腐败、促进党风建设和廉政建设的一件大事来抓，取得显著效果。
    据统计，1987年以来，全省共发生各类占地建私房25137起，面积4495.25亩，其中党政机关干部职工建私房14000起，占地1700亩。省委、省政府决心抓好清理违纪建私房的工作，纠正这股歪风。
    省委、省政府今年7月专门向全省下发了清理违章建私房的通知。省里成立了以省长王朝文、省纪委书记刘汉桢为正副组长的清房领导小组，各地、市、县也建立了清房领导小组和办公机构，层层落实责任制。对清查出的确属违法违章所建私房，视其情节和后果，或拆除，或没收，或罚款；对建房中以权谋私、假公济私的，经济上如数退赔、补款、补息。对违法违纪者还给以相应的法律制裁和纪律处分。对主动检讨、主动拆除、主动退赔的，从轻处理或免于处分。
