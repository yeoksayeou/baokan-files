The textile industry is currently facing challenges such as a lack of funds, insufficient electricity, and tight raw material supplies. Hunan's textile industry has managed to stay active despite these difficulties. By expanding the sources of raw materials and adjusting product structures, they have managed to replace cotton with hemp and synthetic fibers with hemp. As a result, both production value and profits have increased compared to last year. In the first half of the year, the total production value grew by 3.5% compared to the same period last year, and the realized profits and taxes increased by 10.08%. Since July, production and sales have remained relatively stable.

According to a report from the *Market News*, Hunan's textile industry faced a significant cotton shortage this year, with the actual supply amounting to only 60.75% of the annual requirement. The cotton that was procured was of poor quality, with serious issues of adulteration and counterfeiting, leading to higher production costs. The Hunan Provincial Textile Industry Bureau analyzed the situation, acknowledging both the difficulties and the opportunities. They believed that despite the challenges, effective measures could still drive production forward. The bureau's leaders visited various regions, including Changde, Yueyang, and Zhuzhou, to provide guidance to enterprises and proposed the strategy of "Find, Replace, Save, and Dig" to overcome the difficulties.

"Find" means exploring every possible avenue to secure raw materials. This year, the Hunan Provincial Textile Industry Bureau's Materials Company organized 1,200 tons of various non-planned raw materials for enterprises. Local and municipal departments, as well as enterprises, also proactively secured raw materials. "Replace" means utilizing more non-cotton fibers, particularly leveraging Hunan's abundant ramie resources to increase the use of hemp. The Changsha Woolen Textile Mill converted all 4,700 spindles of its woolen fine-spun equipment to process hemp, and eight textile enterprises in Zhuzhou City all produce hemp products. "Save" and "Dig" mean focusing on saving and tapping into potential. Statistics show that this year, the net cotton consumption per ton of yarn is 5 kilograms less than the planned target, the yarn consumption per 100 meters of cotton fabric has decreased by 0.56 kilograms compared to last year, the net wool consumption per 100 kilograms of wool yarn has decreased by 0.98 kilograms compared to the same period last year, and the mixed ramie consumption per ton of ramie yarn has decreased by 17.03 kilograms compared to the same period last year.

The strategies of "Find, Replace, Save, and Dig," combined with product upgrades and increased production of combed yarn, have led to an average increase of more than 2 counts in yarn fineness across the province in the first half of the year. It is estimated that the added value for the year will be 50 million yuan.

### “找、代、节、挖”渡难关  湖南纺织业产销稳定

   “找、代、节、挖”渡难关
    湖南纺织业产销稳定
    本报讯  缺钱，少电，原材料紧张，是当前纺织业普遍面临的困难。湖南纺织行业紧中有活，广开原料来源，调整产品结构，以麻代棉、以麻代化纤，使产值、利润比去年有所增长。上半年总产值比去年同期增长3.5％，实现利税比去年同期增长10.08％。7月份以后，产销仍然比较稳定。
    据《市场报》报道，今年湖南纺织用棉缺口较大，实际供应量只有年度用量的60.75％，调来的棉花品级也较差，掺杂使假严重，生产成本较高。湖南省纺织工业局分析了面临的形势，既看到困难，也看到希望。他们觉得：尽管困难不小，但并非一筹莫展，只要措施得力，生产是可以搞上去的。局领导分赴常德、岳阳、株洲等地为企业出主意，提出靠“找、代、节、挖”渡过难关。
    找，就是千方百计开辟原料资源。今年以来，湖南纺织工业局物资公司共为企业组织各种计划外原料1200吨，各地市主管部门和企业也主动抓原料。代，就是多吃非棉纤维，特别是利用湖南苎麻资源丰富的优势，多吃麻。长沙毛纺织厂4700锭毛精纺设备全部改为吃麻，株洲市8家纺织企业家家有麻产品。节、挖，就是在节约、挖潜方面下功夫。据统计，今年每吨棉纱净用棉量比计划指标低5公斤，每100米棉布用纱量比去年下降0.56公斤，每100公斤毛线净用毛量比去年同期减少0.98公斤，每吨苎麻纱混合耗麻量比去年同期降低17.03公斤。
    “找、代、节、挖”加上产品换代，增产精梳纱，上半年，全省平均纱支提高了2支以上，预计全年增值5000万元。
