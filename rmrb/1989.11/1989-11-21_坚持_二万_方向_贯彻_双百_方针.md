As the chief architect of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important statements on literary and artistic issues since the new period have enriched and developed Mao Zedong's thoughts on literature and art under new historical conditions. They are also the theoretical foundation for adjusting and formulating the Party's policies on literature and art. To correctly implement the "Two Serves" direction and the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy, and to promote the prosperity and development of China's literary and artistic undertakings along the socialist path, we must adhere to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theories on literary and artistic issues as our guide.

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, it was Comrade Deng Xiaoping who first proposed that "we should continue to adhere to the direction of serving the broadest masses of the people, and first of all, the workers, peasants, and soldiers, as proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong." He did not require literature and art to "subordinate to temporary, specific, and direct political tasks." He emphasized that "around the common goal of achieving the Four Modernizations, the path of literature and art should become wider and wider." It was under this guidance that the Party Central Committee decided to replace "literature and art serving politics" with "literature and art serving the people and serving socialism" as the overall slogan for China's literary and artistic work. This is a major adjustment and development of the Party's literary and artistic policy since the new period. It not only points out a broader path for the development of literature and art in China but also draws a clear principle line with bourgeois literature and art in terms of the overall direction and goal of literary and artistic development. Correctly adhering to the "Two Serves" direction is the fundamental guarantee for the healthy development of China's literary and artistic undertakings. In recent years, a very small number of people have said that the "Two Serves" direction is "imposed on literature and art from the outside." They have used various methods to dilute and even fundamentally oppose the "Two Serves" direction, resulting in the spread of bourgeois liberalization in the literary and artistic field. The severe facts have proven from the opposite side the extreme importance of adhering to the "Two Serves" direction. In fact, a few years ago, Comrade Deng Xiaoping had already timely pointed out the phenomenon and danger of some people's indifference towards the "Two Serves" slogan. Today, in the process of calmly reflecting on the past and thinking about the future, re-learning Comrade Deng Xiaoping's statements on the "Two Serves" direction feels particularly close to heart.

Regarding the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend," Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly reiterated it under new historical conditions and, on the basis of summing up historical experience, has made new interpretations. He pointed out that "letting a hundred flowers blossom" is not only to advocate the free competition of different forms, styles, and methods of expression but also, under the correct ideological guidance, to advocate the "rich and varied" themes and to have a broad space for "thought" and "content."

As a clear judgment of the Party and state leaders, these interpretations have expanded the connotation of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy and also added vitality and appeal to the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy. At the same time, Comrade Deng Xiaoping also clearly pointed out that the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy is a "proletarian Marxist policy" and not a "bourgeois liberalist policy." He opposed the distortion of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy into "absolute freedom of speech." This provides us with a powerful ideological weapon to correctly grasp the fundamental nature of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy. Fully understanding and mastering Comrade Deng Xiaoping's statements on the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy is also crucial for the development of China's literary and artistic undertakings. The living facts of recent years have told us that in the process of vigorously promoting free competition in creation and free debate in theory, we must not forget the nature of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy itself as a Marxist policy. Some "cultural elites" under the pretext of creative freedom and critical freedom have advocated "freedom without conditions" and "freedom without any restrictions." In reality, they only allow themselves to deny and attack Marxism and socialism and do not allow the voice of Marxism to come out and compete. However, Zhao Ziyang encouraged and supported this, resulting in not only the confusion of thoughts in the literary and artistic circles but also the trampling of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy itself within a certain range. The lessons from this need to be seriously summarized.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping's scientific statements on the relationship between the "Two Serves" direction and the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy are also what we should remember when grasping the relationship between the two. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that to "satisfy the people's spiritual life needs in various aspects" and to promote their "historical creative activities" in the construction of socialist modernization, we must implement the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy to "continuously prosper literature and art." At the same time, he also pointed out that the purpose of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy is to "promote the prosperity of socialist culture," and the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy cannot be separated from the "Two Serves" direction. In other words, the "Two Serves" as the overall slogan of China's literary and artistic work indicates the overall direction and goal of literary and artistic development, and the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" as another basic policy indicates the path and method to prosper literature and art and achieve the "Two Serves." The two are complementary and dialectically unified. If the path and method of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" are separated, the "Two Serves" direction will be empty; if the "Two Serves" direction is separated, the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy will lose its intended purpose and will not be a socialist literary and artistic policy. In a sense, the relationship between the "Two Serves" direction and the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy is a manifestation of the relationship between adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up in literary and artistic work. Only by grasping them from their inseparable connection can both policies be correctly implemented. And one of the important manifestations of liberalization in the literary and artistic field is to oppose the "Two Serves" direction and the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy, to exclude the "Two Serves" direction, and to emphasize the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy alone, and then to replace the Marxist and socialist nature of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy. Under the banner of "creative freedom" and "critical freedom," they blatantly propagate liberalization. It is also in this sense that we should resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization, clarify the series of ideological and theoretical issues that have been confused by the liberalization trend, not only to pave the way for the full implementation of the "Two Serves" policy but also to create conditions for better implementation of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy.

The publication of "Deng Xiaoping on Literature and Art" is a major event on the current literary and artistic front in China, which will strongly promote various works on the literary and artistic front. I believe that through serious study combined with actual work, it will definitely promote the deepening of the opposition to bourgeois liberalization on the literary and artistic front, promote the full implementation of the "Two Serves" direction and the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools" policy, and promote the healthy development of literary and artistic undertakings.

### 坚持“二万”方向　贯彻“双百”方针

　　坚持“二万”方向　贯彻“双百”方针
　　李准
    作为建设有中国特色的社会主义的总设计师，邓小平同志新时期以来关于文艺问题的一系列重要论述，是在新的历史条件下对毛泽东文艺思想的丰富与发展，也是调整、制定党的文艺方针政策的思想理论基础。我们要正确地贯彻“二为”方向和“双百”方针，推动我国文艺事业沿着社会主义道路不断繁荣发展，就必须坚持以邓小平同志关于文艺问题的理论为指导。
    党的十一届三中全会以后，是邓小平同志最先提出“我们要继续坚持毛泽东同志提出的文艺为最广大的人民群众、首先为工农兵服务的方向”，不要求文艺“从属于临时的、具体的、直接的政治任务”，强调
  “围绕着实现四个现代化的共同目标，文艺的路子要越走越宽”。正是以这一思想为指导，党中央决定用
  “文艺为人民服务，为社会主义服务”取代“文艺为政治服务”作为我国文艺工作的总口号。这是新时期以来党的文艺方针的一个重大调整与发展，它既为我国文艺发展指明了更加广阔的道路，又从文艺发展总方向和总目标上与资本主义文艺划清了原则界限。正确地坚持“二为”方向，是我国文艺事业健康发展的根本保证。近几年来，极少数人说什么“二为”方向是“从外面强加给文艺”的，用种种方法淡化乃至根本反对“二为”方向，结果导致了资产阶级自由化在文艺领域的泛滥，严峻的事实从反面证明了坚持“二为”方向的无比重要性。其实，早在几年前，邓小平同志就及时指出了一些人对“二为”口号“表示淡漠”的现象及其危险性。今天，在冷静地反思过去和思考未来中重新学习邓小平同志关于“二为”方向的论述，感到格外亲切。
    对于党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，邓小平同志在新历史条件下多次加以重申，并在总结历史经验的基础上作出了新的阐发。他指出，“百花齐放”不只是要提倡不同的形式、风格、表现手法的自由竞赛，而且在正确思想指导下要提倡
  “题材”的“丰富多采”，要有“思想”和“内容”的广阔天地。
    作为党的国家领导人的明确论断，这些阐发开拓了“双百”方针的内涵，也增添了“双百”方针的生命力和感召力。与此同时，邓小平同志又毫不含糊地指出，“双百”方针是“无产阶级的马克思主义的方针”而不是“资产阶级自由主义的方针”，要反对把“双百”方针歪曲为“鸣放绝对自由”。这为我们正确把握“双百”方针的根本性质提供了有力的思想武器。完整地理解和掌握邓小平同志关于“双百”方针的论述，对我国文艺事业的发展也是至关重要的。近几年来的活生生的事实告诉我们，在放手开展创作上的自由竞赛和理论上的自由争鸣时切不可忘记了“双百”方针本身作为马克思主义方针的性质。某些“文化精英”打着创作自由和评论自由的幌子，鼓吹“没有前提的自由”、“没有任何限制的自由”，实际上只准他们否定、攻击马克思主义和社会主义，不准马克思主义声音出来争，赵紫阳同志却加以纵容和鼓励，到头来不但文艺界的思想被搞乱了，在一定范围内连“双百”方针本身也遭到践踏，其中的教训是需要认真加以总结的。
    邓小平同志对“二为”方向和“双百”方针关系的科学论述，同样是我们在把握二者之间关系时所应当牢记的。邓小平同志指出，
  “满足人民精神生活多方面的需要”，推动他们从事社会主义现代化建设的“历史性创造活动”，必须通过贯彻“双百”方针以“不断繁荣文学艺术”来实现；同时又指出，“‘双百’方针的目的就是促进社会主义文化的繁荣”，“双百”方针离不开“二为”方向。换言之，“二为”作为我国文艺工作的总口号，它所指明的是文艺发展的总方向和总目标，“双百”作为另一个基本方针，它所指明的是繁荣文艺、实现“二为”的途径和方式，二者之间是相辅相成、辩证统一的。如果离开了“双百”的途径和方式，
  “二为”方向就会落空；如果离开了“二为”方向的规范，“双百”方针就会失去应有的目的，就不成其为社会主义的文艺方针。从某种意义上来说，“二为”方向和“双百”方针的关系就是坚持四项基本原则和改革开放的关系在文艺工作中的一种体现，只有从它们不可分割的联系中加以把握才能使两个方针都得到正确贯彻。而文艺领域中自由化的一个重要表现，就是把
  “二为”方向和“双百”方针对立起来，排斥“二为”方向，孤立地强调“双百”，进而偷换“双百”方针的马克思主义性质和社会主义性质，在“创作自由”、“评论自由”的旗号下明目张胆地去宣传自由化主张。也正是从这种意义上说，切实反对资产阶级自由化，澄清被自由化思潮弄乱了的一系列思想理论问题，不仅能为“二为”方针的全面贯彻扫清道路，也能为更好地贯彻“双百”方针创造条件。
      《邓小平论文艺》的出版是当前我国文艺战线的一件大事，对于文艺战线的各项工作都是一个有力的推动。我相信，通过联系实际的认真学习，它一定会推动文艺战线反对资产阶级自由化的深入开展，推动“二为”方向、“双百”方针的全面贯彻，推动文艺事业的健康发展。
