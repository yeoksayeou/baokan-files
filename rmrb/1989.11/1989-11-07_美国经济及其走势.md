According to preliminary official estimates, the U.S. economic growth rate for the third quarter of this year was the same as the second quarter, both at 2.5%, which is 1.2% lower than the first quarter.

However, while maintaining so-called "moderate" growth, various unfavorable factors in the U.S. economy are becoming increasingly prominent, making the outlook for the coming period less optimistic.

Overall, the actual performance of the U.S. economy in the first nine months of this year was better than originally expected. The average quarterly growth rate of the Gross National Product (GNP) was 2.9%, and the average inflation rate, calculated using the GNP fixed weighted price index, was approximately 4.2%.

The main factors that allowed the U.S. economy to maintain this situation are: stable growth in personal consumption expenditure and corporate fixed capital investment; improvement in foreign trade balance; and the Federal Reserve Board's easing of monetary policy starting from early June, which lowered the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates.

The Bush administration is satisfied with the current economic situation and optimistically predicts that the economy will continue to grow steadily.

However, the economic community generally estimates that the economic growth rate for the fourth quarter of this year will further slow down to between 1-1.5%, and some even believe that there is a possibility of a recession within the next year. Their basis for this is the recent economic indicators released by the government, which are mostly negative.

	* Manufacturing is shrinking. In the past period, due to increased exports, U.S. manufacturing developed rapidly and, to some extent, played the role of the "engine" driving U.S. economic growth. However, since this year, manufacturing has gradually lost its vitality and begun to decline. This is evident in the decline in production, reduction in orders, and increase in unemployment;

	* The trade deficit is expanding again. The trade deficit in August increased by $26 billion compared to July, reaching $108 billion. The appreciation of the dollar is a major factor, as it reduces exports and increases imports; the Treasury Department recently estimated that the U.S. trade deficit may worsen next year;

	* Corporate profits have significantly decreased. On an annualized basis, corporate profits in the second quarter decreased by approximately $100 billion compared to the first quarter, and recently, many large companies have also announced sharp declines in profits;

	* Factory orders are decreasing and inventories are increasing, which indicates that the growth rate of personal consumption expenditure will shrink;

	* Automobile sales are sluggish. In mid-October, automobile sales volume decreased by 20.5% compared to the same period last year, and several major automobile companies have planned to reduce their fourth-quarter production by 10.4% compared to the same period last year;

	* The housing construction industry is sluggish. In the first nine months, there were six months with a decline in the number of housing starts;

	* The stock market is volatile. The 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on October 13 was caused by multiple factors, but it also reflects, to some extent, investors' concerns and anxieties about the current state and future trends of the U.S. economy.

In the current situation, people are hoping that the Federal Reserve Board will further ease monetary policy to stimulate economic growth, as the "balanced budget law" has constrained the federal government's ability to increase spending.

However, due to concerns about the resurgence of inflation, the Federal Reserve Board's room for maneuver is also limited.

    美国经济及其走势
    本报记者　张亮
    据官方初步估计，今年第3季度美国经济增长率与第2季度相同，均为2.5％，比第1季度低1.2％。
    然而，在保持所谓“适度”增长的同时，美国经济中的诸多不利因素渐趋突出，因而今后一个时期的走势不容乐观。
    总的来看，今年头9个月美国经济的实际运行情况比人们原先预计的好一些。国民生产总值按季度平均增长率为2.9％，按国民生产总值固定加权价格指数计算的通货膨胀率平均为大约4.2％。
    美国经济之所以能维持这种状况的主要因素是：个人消费支出和企业固定资本投资稳定增长；外贸收支状况有所改善；联邦储备委员会从6月初开始放松银根，降低了联邦基金利率，其它短期利率也有下降。
    布什政府对当前经济形势感到满意，并乐观地预测经济仍将继续稳定增长。
    但是，此间经济界普遍估计今年第4季度经济将进一步放慢到1—1.5％之间，有人甚至认为明年内有可能滑入衰退。其根据是近时期政府公布的经济指标凶多吉少。
    ——制造业萎缩。在过去一段时期内，由于出口增加，美国制造业发展迅速，并在一定程度上起了驱动美国经济增长的“火车头”作用。但是，今年以来，制造业逐渐丧失活力，开始走上了下坡路。其表现是生产下降，订货减少，失业人数增多；
    ——外贸赤字又呈扩大趋势。8月份外贸赤字比7月份猛增26亿美元，达108亿美元。其中美元升值是一大因素，因为美元升值使出口减少进口增加；财政部最近估计，明年美国外贸赤字可能会恶化；
    ——公司利润大幅度下降。按年率计算，第2季度公司利润比第一季度减少大约100亿美元，最近许多大公司也公布其利润骤减；
    ——工厂订货下降、库存增加。这预示个人消费支出的增长幅度将会缩减；
    ——汽车销售不畅。10月中旬汽车销售量比去年同期下降20.5％，几家大汽车公司已计划将第4季度的产量比去年同期压缩10.4％；
    ——住宅建筑业不景气。在头9个月中，有6个月开工率在下降；
    ——股票市场动荡不稳。10月13日道·琼斯工业股票指数暴跌190点是由多种因素造成的，但它在某种程度上也反映了投资者对美国经济现状及其走势的忧虑和不安。
    在当前情况下，人们寄希望于联邦储备委员会通过进一步放松货币政策来刺激经济增长，因为“平衡预算法”已束缚了联邦政府扩大开支的手脚。
    但是，由于人们担心通货膨胀死灰复燃，联邦储备委员会的回旋余地也是有限的。
