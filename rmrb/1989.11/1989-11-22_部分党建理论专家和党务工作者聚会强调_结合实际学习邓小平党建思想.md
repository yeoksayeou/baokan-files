Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 21st.

More than 100 experts, scholars, and party affairs workers who engage in party building theory research recently gathered in Chengdu to study and discuss Deng Xiaoping's thoughts on building the ruling party.

The seminar, jointly organized by the China Staff Education Association, the *Study* magazine, and the Organization Department of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee, focused on discussing Deng Xiaoping's theories on the ideological, organizational, and work style construction of the ruling party. Practical party affairs workers also shared their experiences and insights on applying Deng Xiaoping's party building thoughts in their work.

Participants emphasized that Deng Xiaoping's thoughts on building the ruling party are a continuation and development of Mao Zedong's thoughts on party building, adapted to the conditions of the ruling party and the reform and opening up.

The meeting noted that studying and researching Deng Xiaoping's thoughts on party building must be closely linked to major issues in current party building work, such as how to uphold the party's leading core position in the context of modernization construction and reform and opening up; how to uphold the four cardinal principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization; how to promote intra-party democracy, improve party democratic life, and the collective leadership system; how to learn and manage a planned commodity economy; and how to strengthen the construction of party rules and discipline. Only by strengthening learning and research can we, from the perspective of combining theory and practice, answer and solve these problems, and build our party into a strong core leading socialist modernization construction.

　　部分党建理论专家和党务工作者聚会强调
　　结合实际学习邓小平党建思想
    据新华社成都11月21日电　（记者邹沛颜）100多位从事党建理论研究的专家、学者和党务工作者最近聚会成都，对邓小平同志关于执政党建设思想进行了研究探讨。
    由中国干部教育协会、《学习》杂志社和中共四川省委组织部联合主办的这次研讨会，比较集中地对邓小平同志关于执政党的思想建设、组织建设和作风建设的理论进行了探讨；同时，从事实际工作的党务工作者还交流了运用邓小平党建思想做好工作的经验体会。
    参加研讨会的同志强调，邓小平同志关于执政党建设的思想，是在执政和改革开放时期，恢复、继承和发展了的毛泽东建党思想。
    会议认为，学习研究邓小平同志党建思想，一定要紧密结合当前党的建设工作中的重大问题，主要是在现代化建设和改革开放的历史条件下，如何坚持党的领导核心地位；如何坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化；如何发扬党内民主，健全党的民主生活和集体领导制度；如何学习组织管理有计划的商品经济；如何加强党规党纪的建设等。只有加强学习和研究，才能从理论和实践的结合上，回答和解决这些问题，把我们的党建设成为领导社会主义现代化建设的坚强核心。
