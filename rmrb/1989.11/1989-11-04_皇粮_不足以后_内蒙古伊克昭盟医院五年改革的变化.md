After the "Imperial Grain" is Insufficient...
—The Changes in Five Years of Reform at the Yikezhao League Hospital in Inner Mongolia

Probably, hospitals across the country are not very wealthy. Why do hospitals become poorer the more they are run? The root of the problem is that hospitals rely on the state's operational funds, the "imperial grain." When the supply of "imperial grain" is insufficient, the hospitals become half-dead.

Facing this dilemma, Yun He, who took office as the director of the Yikezhao League Hospital in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in early 1984, believed that to alleviate poverty, hospitals cannot rely solely on the state. They must, while emphasizing the improvement of medical ethics, learn and enhance their economic management skills. Soon, Yun He implemented the hospital economic management responsibility system here. Some people said that industrial contracting is natural, agricultural contracting is reasonable, commercial contracting is profit-seeking; how can hospitals combine their actual situation to carry out reforms?

Reform is difficult. Yun He had to fight to the end.

The Yikezhao League Hospital has changed over these years. What has changed?

Outpatient services are not limited by quotas. Even for difficult-to-register departments like the dental clinic, patients can be seen on the same day.

Registration, medication pickup, laboratory tests, and payments in various departments do not require long queues.

The waiting time for various examinations has been shortened.

Critical patients brought to the emergency room are immediately rescued without being transferred to the ward, saving time.

Every day, experienced experts go to the outpatient department.

Patients who cannot be admitted to the hospital can receive treatment at a hotel.

Patients from remote rural areas who cannot come to the city can be treated by doctors from the mobile branch hospital…

The consistency rate of admission and discharge diagnoses and the cure rate are both above 95%. In 1988, the total business income reached 4.14 million yuan, which is 2.97 times that of 1983.

The reform started in April 1984, and changes appeared in the same month and year.

The hospital signed a responsibility contract with the Health Bureau of the League, and each department signed a responsibility contract with the hospital. All work in the hospital is supervised by 99 regulations and 121 technical quality standards. If outpatient patients come for a diagnosis three times without a confirmed diagnosis and do not consult with a higher-level doctor, if difficult cases are not discussed, if errors occur, if the chief and deputy chief physicians do not go to the outpatient department for at least two and a half days per week, if medical records are not written correctly, if emergency vehicles are delayed, if the pharmacy is short of more than three commonly used medicines, or if there is an argument with the patient, points will be deducted.

The hospital evaluates the departments, and the departments evaluate individuals, including work volume, medical and nursing quality, business income, and even the consumption of supplies, all with detailed evaluation criteria and reward and punishment standards.

It has always been believed that socialist hospitals cannot make money. If economic accounts are not calculated, how can the hospital not be poor? Even the most basic medical equipment is lacking, how can one talk about saving lives? On the other hand, if one only talks about making money and ignores service quality, it will also deviate from the purpose of running the hospital. The Yikezhao League Hospital uses the responsibility effect to solve this contradiction.

Does the responsibility contract have such a great effect?

Taking the B-type ultrasound in the functional examination department as an example, the machine is still the same, and the people are still the same, but the work efficiency is completely different. Deputy Chief Physician and Director Wang Jinrui introduced that in the past, whether one worked more or less was the same. The machine was only turned on for three and a half days a week, and 7 to 10 people were examined per day. Patients often had to make an appointment a month in advance. Now, the machine is turned on for 10 to 12 half-days a week, and patients make an appointment for no more than a week. The machine has played a greater role. The medical staff of the functional examination department also receive some compensation for their labor.

The dental department used to limit the number of patients seen, but now the contract stipulates that no limits are allowed, and at least 60 patients must be seen per day. Although the work is tiring, a director of this department highly praises the evaluation. He said: "In the past, without evaluation, it was difficult to be the director of the department; now, how much work each person does and the quality of the work are clear, and during the department's evaluation, it is easy to divide into first, second, and third classes."

In fact, the difference in bonuses in this department is not large. Bonuses are not only commodities of equivalent value but also carriers of honor. In the obstetrics and gynecology department, doctors always try to find more work to do because the reform has given them greater freedom to serve the patients. In 1985, the department sent several medical staff to the Zhaohua Town Health Center in the Qungol Banner for technical assistance and training, and in 21 days, they saw more than 400 patients and performed 59 surgeries. They went to the countryside, solving the problem of "difficulty in seeing a doctor" for the masses and improving the technical level of the local hospital. The surgical bonus they earned was used for business construction and to send doctors and nurses to participate in academic activities. In fact, this investment was returned to the patients through medical services.

In patient care, the hospital also implemented responsibility care, strengthened checks, and reduced errors. In the past, nurses would distribute medicine, and patients would count the pills to check for errors. Now, no one counts them anymore. There was a patient with myocardial infarction who, after admission, had a heart stoppage for 75 minutes. Due to timely discovery and rescue, the patient turned from danger to safety, creating a hospital record.

High-quality medical and nursing services have made the 669 doctors and nurses of the Yikezhao League Hospital more tense and harder working than before. However, through joint efforts, they shared the honor of being a national advanced collective in the health system and a civilized hospital named by the autonomous region.

    “皇粮”不足以后……
    ——内蒙古伊克昭盟医院五年改革的变化
    赵咏峰　李春萍　王志发
    大概，全国的医院都不很富裕。医院为何越办越穷？病根是：医院吃国家事业费的“皇粮”，“皇粮”供应不足，医院便半死不活。
    面对这种困惑，1984年初出任内蒙古自治区伊克昭盟医院院长的云鹤认为，医院要治穷，光依赖国家是不行的，必须在注重提高医疗道德的同时，学会并提高经济管理的本领。不久，云鹤就在这里推行了医院经济管理责任制。有人说工业承包，天经地义，农村承包，合情合理，商业承包，保本求利；医院如何结合医院的实际进行改革呢？
    改革是困难的。云鹤要背水一战。
    伊克昭盟医院这几年变了。变在哪里？
    门诊不限号。即使是口腔科这样的挂号难科室，当天也能看上病。
    各科挂号、取药、化验、交费不排长队。
    各项检查预约时间缩短。
    危重病人送进急诊室立即抢救，不必再转送病房耽误时间。
    每天都有经验丰富的专家出门诊。
    住不上院的患者可到旅店接受治疗。
    进不起城的偏远农村患者可以由流动分院的大夫前往治疗……。
    入出院诊断符合率和治愈率都在95％以上，1988年业务总收入达到414万元，是1983年的2.97倍。
    改革从1984年4月开始，变化也在同年同月出现。
    医院同盟卫生处签订责任合同，各科室再同医院签订责任合同。全院各项工作都置于99项规章、121条技术质量标准的监督之下，凡门诊病人3次来诊仍无确诊，又不请上级医生会诊的，疑难病例不讨论的，发生差错的，正副主任医师每周出门诊不够两个半天的，病历书写不合格的，急诊出车拖延的，药房常用药品短缺3种以上的，和病人吵架的……都要扣分。
    医院考核科室，科室考核个人，工作量，医护质量，业务收入乃至用品消耗等，全订出考核细则和奖罚标准。
    向来认为社会主义医院是赚不得钱的。不算经济账，医院岂能不穷？连起码的医疗设备都没有，救死扶伤又从何谈起？相反，如果只讲赚钱，忽略服务质量，也会背离办院宗旨。伊克昭盟医院用责任效应的办法解决了这一矛盾。
    责任合同果真有这么大作用吗？
    以功能检查科的B型超声波为例，机器还是那么一台，人还是那么多，工作效率却是今非昔比。副主任医师、科主任王金锐介绍说，过去干多干少一个样，一周只开机3个半天，一天检查7到10人，病人常常预约到一个月以后。现在一周开机10至12个半天，病人预约最多不过一周。机器发挥了更大功效。功能检查科医护人员的劳动也得到一定补偿。
    口腔科过去限号看病，现在合同规定不许限号，每天要看60人以上。工作虽累，这个科的一位主任却对考核大加赞赏。他说：“过去没有考核，科主任难当；现在每人干多少活，工作质量如何，清清楚楚，科内考察时，很容易划分一、二、三等。”
    其实，这个科的奖金级差并不大，奖金不仅是商品等价物，还是荣誉的载体。在妇产科，医生们总是想多找些事干，因为改革使她们为患者服务有了更大的自由度。1985年科里派出几名医务人员到准格尔旗蓿亥素乡卫生院搞技术帮教，21天看了400多个病人，作了59例手术。他们下到乡村，既解决了群众“看病难”，又提高了当地医院的技术水平，所得的手术提成拿回来，搞业务建设，送医生护士外出参加学术活动。实际上，这个投资又通过医疗服务返还给了患者。
    在对病人的护理上，医院也实行了责任护理，加强了查对，减少了差错。以往护士发药，病人得数数药片，看有无差错。现在没人去数了。有一心肌梗塞患者，入院后心跳骤停75分钟，由于发现和抢救及时，竟转危为安，创建院史记录。
    高质量的医护服务使伊克昭盟医院的669名医生、护士比以前更紧张，更辛苦了。但是经过协同努力，他们共享全国卫生系统先进集体和自治区命名的文明医院的荣誉。
