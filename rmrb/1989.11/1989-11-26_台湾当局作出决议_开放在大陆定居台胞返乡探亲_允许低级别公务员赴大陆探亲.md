Taiwan authorities have made a resolution to allow Taiwan residents who settled on the mainland before 1949 to return home for visits and to permit low-level civil servants to visit the mainland.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hong Kong on November 24, the Kuomintang Central Committee's Mainland Work Guidance Group recently resolved to open up visits for Taiwan residents who settled on the mainland before 1949 and to allow low-level civil servants in Taiwan to visit the mainland.

According to the Taiwan "United Daily News," since November 2, 1987, when the Taiwan authorities opened up visits to the mainland for the general public, civil servants have been excluded from enjoying the right to visit their families. This time, the Kuomintang Mainland Work Guidance Group's resolution allows only low-level civil servants such as office workers, technicians, and sanitation workers, as well as workers in public enterprises, including drivers, to visit the mainland, finally giving this group of civil servants the opportunity to meet and reunite with their mainland relatives.

The Kuomintang Mainland Work Guidance Group in Taiwan also stated that there are approximately 4,000 Taiwan residents who settled on the mainland before 1949. Allowing them to return home for visits is in line with humanitarian spirit and meets social needs.

　　台湾当局作出决议
　　开放在大陆定居台胞返乡探亲
　　允许低级别公务员赴大陆探亲
    据新华社香港11月24日电　台北消息：国民党中央大陆工作指导小组日前决议，将开放1949年以前到大陆定居的台籍同胞返乡探亲，并允许台湾低阶层公务员赴大陆探亲。
    据台湾《联合报》报道，自1987年11月2日台湾当局开放民众赴大陆探亲以来，公务人员始终被摒除于应享探亲权益之外。国民党大陆工作指导小组这次的决议，仅允许机关工友、技工、清洁队员等不涉机密公务人员及公营事业的工人，包括司机前往大陆探亲，总算让这部分公务人员有机会与大陆亲人见面聚叙。
    台湾国民党大陆工作指导小组还表示，1949年以前到大陆定居的台籍同胞约有4000人，允许他们返乡探亲合乎人道精神，也符合社会需求。
