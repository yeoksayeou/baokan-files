A natural gas drilling platform off the coast of Great Yarmouth, England, sank on the night of November 8th after being hit by a storm with winds reaching speeds of up to 70 miles per hour. All 51 workers on the platform were evacuated safely by helicopter before it sank.

The "Ocean Ranger II" gas drilling platform was located about 70 miles northeast of Great Yarmouth. The accident occurred while the platform was being towed to a new oil field by two tugboats. A towing cable suddenly snapped, causing the platform to capsize.
