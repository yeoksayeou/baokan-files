France's "Special Fund"

The French National Assembly votes on the budget each year and approves a "special fund." Once approved, this sum of approximately 400 million francs is secretly managed by the government. The initial reason for establishing this fund was to provide financing for the government's secret activities: supporting exiles, secretly purchasing weapons for some liberation organizations, providing funds to domestic and foreign newspapers that support government policies, and buying military or industrial intelligence, etc. Although part of the money is indeed used for the originally intended purposes, a large portion is used for party activities. The clear destination of the money is a taboo subject.

The Prime Minister's office receives 6 million francs in cash every month. Part of this money is sent to the Presidential Palace, while the rest is kept in the Prime Minister's office for political activities. After the money is delivered, the chiefs of various ministries come one after another to receive valuable envelopes. The envelopes contain checks, and the amounts vary depending on the importance of the ministries and the ministers. Ordinary state secretaries can receive 15,000 to 25,000 francs per month, ministers can receive 35,000 to 50,000 francs, and important ministers can receive 70,000 francs.

In the political circle, few people discuss this "black money." However, there are exceptions. Hugues Bertaud de la Malene revealed to *Le Figaro* that he used this money to solve the funding problem for his 1986 parliamentary election. Jean Le Garrec said this money is generally given as allowances to staff.

Officials who receive the money never have to declare this income on their tax returns. The state turns a blind eye to this. One person honestly declared this allowance on his income tax return, but his conscientious civic duty was criticized by his colleagues.

We asked how the tax authorities would verify if they found that a government member's living standards did not match their declared income. The head of the tax bureau embarrassedly replied, "No comment."

### 法国的“特别经费”

    法国的“特别经费”
    法国国民议会每年表决预算时，都要通过一项“特别经费”。一经通过，这笔约4亿法郎的巨款就由政府秘密支配。当初设立这一款项的理由是为政府的秘密活动提供经费：资助流亡人士、为一些解放组织私下购买武器、向支持政府政策的国内外报纸提供资金、收买军事或工业情报等等，尽管一部分钱确实派作最初规定的用途，可是其中一大部分却被用于政党活动，钱的明确去向是一个忌讳的话题。
    每月总理办公厅主任可以得到一笔600万法郎的现钞。这些钱一部分送到总统府，另一部分留在总理府作政治活动经费。钱送到之后，各位部长的办公室主任便接踵而来，领取宝贵的大信封。信封中装的是支票，金额根据各部和各部长的重要性而异。普通的国务秘书每月可得到1.5万至2.5万法郎，部长可得到3.5万至5万法郎，重要的部长可得到7万法郎。
    在政界中很少有人谈及这笔“黑钱”。不过也有例外。于盖特·布沙尔多向《十字架报》透露，他用这笔钱解决了1986年他参加议会选举的资金问题。让·勒·加莱克说这笔钱一般作为津贴发给工作人员。
    拿到钱的官员们从来不必在税单上填写这笔收入。国家对此也熟视无睹。有一个人在自己的收入申报单上老老实实填上了这笔津贴，他自觉履行公民义务的行为却遭到同僚们的非难。
    我们曾问过，如果发现某政府成员的生活水平与申报的工资不符时，税收部门如何进行核查？税收总局的负责人尴尬地回答说，无可奉告。
