The formation of the European Single Market in 1992, the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement that came into effect on January 1st this year, and the current discussions on the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the economic systems of Latin America and the Arab Common Market all indicate that the world economy is moving towards regionalization and integration. This trend will have a profound impact on the current and future international trade landscape.

Firstly, customs unions and free trade agreements have two contradictory functions: they promote trade liberalization within the member states, but they also implement discriminatory treatment towards non-members. Generally, the more similar the labor productivity levels are among the participating countries, the harder it is to achieve complete specialization. This situation is common among Western developed countries, such as the European Free Trade Association. However, countries that are constrained by natural factors in primary product trade or have complementary export-import commodity structures are more likely to form regional blocs and fall into complete specialization. In this case, external trade decreases, internal trade increases, and exclusivity becomes stronger.

Secondly, as a coordinated policy and unified tariff regional common market, by eliminating trade barriers and removing obstacles to the free flow of currency, labor, and capital, it achieves intense competition and large-scale production economies of scale, thereby gaining technological benefits. In other words, through a large market, it can break the vicious cycle formed by the traditional trade pattern and turn towards a virtuous cycle, i.e., from high-profit margins → low capital turnover → high market prices → market shrinkage, to a large market → large-scale production (economies of scale) → low market prices → market expansion.

Thirdly, regional integration will further promote the expansion and development of mutual direct investment. To bypass the discriminatory treatment and trade barriers set by the common market, many countries and multinational corporations have invested in local factories, making enterprises and products local. As some businessmen in the Asia-Pacific region have said, "The fortress is easiest to breach from within"; "Let Europeans think we are European enterprises rather than Asian, and achieve the Europeanization of Asian enterprises within the unified market." In this regard, Japan is the most prominent example. Currently, Japan has established 1,400 companies in the member states of the Community. American multinational corporations also adopt a detour strategy towards the Community, first investing in peripheral countries like Spain, Portugal, and Ireland to establish a foothold, and then investing in highly competitive countries to set up factories. Similarly, some multinational corporations in the EC are also taking measures to expand their direct investments abroad to counter the flexible Japanese companies and the powerful American enterprises.

However, it should also be noted that the rise of regional integration will lead to a confrontational situation in the international trade landscape. This is contrary to the spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which strengthens multilateral trade liberalization and advocates the principle of most-favored-nation treatment.

Regional integration will inevitably lead to a situation where each bloc stands on its own, turning national trade wars into bloc trade wars, and even leading to long-term standoffs, making the General Agreement's promise of strengthening international multilateral coordination and advocating trade liberalization an empty promise, and damaging the trade relations that have already been established among countries.

For example, the United States has abandoned the "free trade" slogan it has advocated for many years since last year and instead emphasized "fair trade." This marks the increasing legalization of trade protectionism and the intensification of trade friction between blocs.

Additionally, the different ways in which economic circles unite will have different impacts on the world economy and trade.

As a multilateral regional integration body, the European Single Market has greater political and social significance than real economic benefits.

The Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement will further deepen the mutual dependence between the two countries' economies and trade, but fundamentally, it is a successful model for the United States to implement its strategy of bilateral trade as the mainstay of its foreign trade.

The economic development and cooperation process in the most economically vibrant Asia-Pacific region will also have an important impact on the world economic and trade landscape in the next century.

### 区域集团化对国际贸易的影响

    区域集团化对国际贸易的影响
　　刘光溪
    1992年欧洲大市场的形成，今年1月1日生效的美加自由贸易协定，目前正在酝酿的亚太经济圈以及拉美经济体系和阿拉伯共同市场的出现，预示了当今世界经济正朝着区域化、集团化方向发展。这种趋势对当前和今后国际贸易格局将产生深远影响。
    首先，关税同盟和自由贸易协定有着相互矛盾的两种职能：对成员国内部是贸易自由化措施，对外则是差别待遇。一般来说，各参加国之间越是劳动生产率水平相差不大，就越是难以形成完全专业化。这种情况主要发生在西方发达国家之间，如欧洲自由贸易联盟。但是受自然因素制约的初级产品或者几个进出口商品结构互补性较大的国家结成区域集团，就容易陷入完全专业化，这时区域外贸易减少，区域内贸易增加，排他性就大。
    其次，作为协调政策和统一关税的地区性共同市场，通过取消妨碍贸易、以及废除外汇以及劳动和资本自由流动的障碍，以实现激烈竞争达到大批量生产的规模经济效益，获得技术利益。也就是说通过大市场可以突破由传统贸易格局形成的恶性循环，进而转向良性循环，即从高利润率→低资本周转率→高市场价格→市场萎缩，转向大市场化→大批量生产（规模经济）→低市场价格→市场扩大。
    第三，区域集团化会进一步促进相互直接投资的扩大和发展。为了绕过共同市场对外设置的差别待遇和贸易壁垒，许多国家和跨国公司纷纷到当地投资办厂，使企业和产品本地化。如亚太地区一些企业家所言，“堡垒最容易从内部攻破”；“让欧洲人认为我们是欧洲企业而非亚洲，在统一大市场内部实现亚资企业欧洲化。”在这方面，最突出的是日本，目前日本在共同体各国已建有1400家公司企业。美国的大跨国公司对共同体也采取迂回的战略，即先在共同体外围如西班牙、葡萄牙、爱尔兰投资设厂，建立桥头堡，然后到竞争性强的国家投资办厂。同样，欧共体的一些跨国公司也采取措施，扩大对外直接投资，以对付灵活的日本公司和势力强大的美国企业。
    但是，也应当看到，区域集团化的兴起会使国际贸易格局出现集团对峙的局面。这与关税及贸易总协定加强多边贸易自由化的精神和提倡的最惠国待遇原则相悖的。
    区域集团化势必造成各据一方，出现以集团对抗集团的格局，使过去国家间贸易战转为集团间的贸易战，甚至会出现长时间对峙的状态，使总协定加强国际多边协调和奉行贸易自由化的诺言成为空话，并且损害了各国之间业已建立起来的贸易关系。
    例如，美国从去年开始，抛弃了多年标榜的“自由贸易”的口号，转而强调“公平贸易”。这就标志着今后贸易保护主义越发合法化，助长集团间的贸易摩擦。
    另外，各经济圈的联合方式不同，对世界经济和贸易的影响程度也就不同。
    作为多边性区域联合体的欧洲统一大市场，政治及社会意义大于现实的经济利益。
    美加自由贸易协定将进一步加深两国经贸间的相互依存关系，但从根本上看则是美国为其推行以双边贸易为主体的对外贸易战略的一个成功样板。
    最具经济活力的亚太地区经济发展与合作的进程也将对下个世纪的世界经济贸易格局产生重要的影响。
