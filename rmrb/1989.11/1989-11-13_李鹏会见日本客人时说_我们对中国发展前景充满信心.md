	Li Peng Meets with Japanese Guests, Expressing Confidence in China's Development Prospects

	Beijing, November 12 — Reporter Sun Yi reports: Premier Li Peng met with a delegation from the 1989 Japanese Economic Mission to China, led by Eisei Saito, senior advisor of the Japan Economic Federation, and Ryōichi Kawagoe, president of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, this morning at the Great Hall of the People. Li Peng pointed out, "Experience has taught us that construction cannot be rushed, reform cannot be rushed, and rectification cannot be rushed. We need to be resolute, but we must proceed cautiously. Our future policy will be to achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated development."

	During the more than two-hour friendly conversation, Li Peng provided detailed information about the domestic situation in China. He said that the recently concluded Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was an important meeting. Deng Xiaoping personally implemented the abolition of the lifelong tenure system for leadership positions that he advocated. This also signifies that China's political situation is stable. The new leadership, with Jiang Zemin as the core, is united and powerful. We are full of confidence in China's development prospects.

	Li Peng said that over the past decade of reform and opening up, we have achieved great successes, and our direction is correct. If there are any shortcomings, it is that we have been too eager for quick results in our implementation. He expressed his belief that as long as we can achieve "sustained, stable, and coordinated" development, we will be fully capable of realizing the "three-step" development strategy proposed by Deng Xiaoping.

	He reiterated that we will maintain the continuity and stability of our reform and opening-up policies and continuously improve and develop them on this basis.

	During the meeting, Li Peng warmly welcomed the visit of the Japanese economic delegation. He said that this delegation's visit to China shows that the friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan and the economic, technological, and trade cooperation between the two countries have not been interrupted and have the potential for further development.

	He continued, "The economic circles of China and Japan have extensive and multi-level connections. The development of economic, technological, and trade relations, including loans, between the two countries is beneficial not only for China's construction but also, from a long-term perspective, for Japan. I sincerely hope that the friendly cooperative relationship established by the older generation of politicians and economic figures of the two countries will not be damaged in our hands, and I hope that all forward-looking Japanese economic figures will make efforts to continue developing this relationship."

	When discussing the sanctions imposed by some Western countries on China, Li Peng said, "Essentially, the sanctions against China are not economic but political." He said that the cause of the current difficulties does not lie with China. We have repeatedly stated that we will not compromise on principles and will not abandon the socialist system. Sanctions will bring some difficulties to China, but they will also harm the countries imposing the sanctions. He expressed that China is willing to work with foreign figures, including those from the Japanese economic sector, to overcome the current difficulties.

	Japanese guests, including Eisei Saito, said that after listening to Li Peng's detailed explanations, they believe that the decisions made at the Fifth Plenary Session are good. Japanese economic figures hope for stability in China because political and economic stability in China is beneficial not only for China but also for Japan and the entire Asia. They also hope that China will continue to follow its established national policies.

	The guests also suggested that the Chinese government, when formulating economic policies in the future, should widely solicit opinions from various sectors, including the political, economic, and academic circles, to make the specific policies more cautious. Li Peng expressed his appreciation for this suggestion.

    李鹏会见日本客人时说
    我们对中国发展前景充满信心
    本报北京十一月十二日讯　记者孙毅报道：国务院总理李鹏今天上午在人民大会堂会见以日本经济团体联合会会长斋藤英四郎为最高顾问、日本经济协会会长河合良一为团长的日本一九八九年度日中经济协会访华团时指出：“经验告诉我们，建设不能急于求成，改革不能急于求成，治理整顿也不能急于求成。我们的决心要大，但在步骤上要稳妥。今后我们的方针就是持续、稳定、协调发展六个字。”
    在长达两个多小时的友好交谈中，李鹏向客人详细地介绍了中国国内的情况。他说，最近召开的中国共产党十三届五中全会是一次重要的会议。邓小平同志身体力行地执行了他所倡导的废除领导职务终身制。这同时也标志着中国的政局是稳定的。以江泽民总书记为核心的新的领导班子是团结一致的、是有力量的。我们对中国的发展前景充满信心。
    李鹏说，改革开放十年来我们取得了很大的成绩，方向是正确的。如果说有什么缺点的话，那就是我们在执行过程中有些急于求成。他表示相信，只要我们能够做到“持续、稳定、协调”发展，我们就完全有把握实现邓小平同志提出的“三步走”的发展战略。
    他再次重申，我们将保持改革开放政策的连续性、稳定性，并在此基础上不断改善和发展。
    会见时，李鹏对日本经济界的朋友来访表示热烈欢迎。他说，这个代表团访华说明中日两国人民的友好交往和两国之间经济、技术、贸易的合作关系没有中断，而且存在着继续发展的可能性。
    他接着说，中日两国经济界有着多领域、多层次的广泛联系。中日两国包括贷款在内的经济技术和贸易关系的发展不仅对中国的建设有利，从长远观点来看，对日本也是有利的。李鹏衷心希望中日两国老一辈政治家和经济界人士开创的友好合作关系不要在我们这一代手中受到损害，希望一切具有长远眼光的日本经济界人士为继续发展这种关系做出努力。
    在谈到一些西方国家对中国实行制裁时，李鹏说，“从本质上来说，对中国的制裁，不是经济上的制裁，而是政治上的制裁。”他说，造成目前困难局面的原因不在中国。我们多次声明，我们绝不会拿原则作交易，绝不会放弃社会主义制度。制裁会给中国带来一些困难，但对实施制裁的国家本身也会带来损害。他表示，中国愿意同包括日本经济界人士在内的外国各界人士共同努力，克服目前出现的困难。
    斋藤英四郎等日本客人表示，听取了李鹏的详细介绍，他们认为，五中全会决议的内容很好。日本经济界人士希望中国稳定，因为中国的政治、经济稳定不仅对中国有利，而且对日本乃至整个亚洲都有利。他们还希望中国方面按照既定的国策进行下去。
    客人们还建议，中国政府在今后制定经济政策时要广泛听取各个方面、包括政界、经济界和学术界的建议，使所制定的各项具体政策更加稳妥。对此，李鹏表示赞赏。
