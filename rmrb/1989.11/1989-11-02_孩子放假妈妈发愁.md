For many working women in France, the school holidays are a major headache.

In the past, French bourgeois ladies (women from wealthy families) did not work, so they did not have to worry about their children's holidays.

However, in today's France, 3/5 of housewives have jobs, and most of them live in cities, far from their parents and in-laws. Moreover, they are eager for their children to succeed and hope that their children's intelligence will improve during the holidays. Therefore, every time school holidays come, countless women are troubled by the problem of their children's holidays.

A survey found that 1/4 of women do not know where to place their children during school holidays; in Paris, 2/5 of women are at a loss as to how to handle their children's holidays; only 66% of children under 13 years old can go on vacation more than once a year, averaging 31 days; 86% of students under 16 years old spend more than two months at home during holidays; 23% of female employees ask their children's grandmothers to come to the house to take care of the children; 18% of female employees entrust their children to a sanatorium, but due to severe shortages in public facilities, many women leave their children alone at home all day.

The survey also revealed more shocking findings: many children aged 8 to 10 are left alone at home for several days each year, or stay at home to take care of their younger siblings; 1/7 of 3-year-olds are taken care of by their older siblings during the two summer months.

In France, students have a total of 4 months of holidays in a year, but employees only have 5 weeks of vacation. This 12-week difference causes many housewives a lot of trouble!

    孩子放假妈妈发愁
    对于很多法国职业妇女来说，孩子放假是最令人头痛的事情。
    从前，法国的布尔乔亚女士们（即指有钱人家的妇女）是不参加工作的，她们自然不必为其孩子的度假操心。
    然而在今日的法国，3／5的家庭主妇有职业，而且大都住在城市，与娘家、婆家及其他亲戚相距甚远，再加上她们望子成龙心切，总希望自己孩子的智能通过假期能大有增长。所以，每当学校放假，不知有多少妇女要为自己孩子的度假问题而愁肠百结。
    调查发现：1／4的妇女不知学校放假期间将其子女放在哪儿；在巴黎，2／5的妇女被孩子的度假问题弄得一筹莫展；仅66％不满13岁的小孩每年可以外出度假一次以上，平均共达31天；86％不满16岁的学生在放假期间呆在家里的时间超过两个月；23％的女职员请求孩子的奶奶或姥姥来家照看孩子；18％的女职员将其孩子托付给疗养院，但由于公共设施严重短缺，很多妇女将其孩子整天单独关在家里。
    调查还有更令人惊愕的发现：许多8岁至10岁的儿童每年至少有好几天单独呆在家里，或在家照看自己的弟弟妹妹；1／7的3岁小孩在夏天的两个月期间要由较为年长的兄妹照看。
    在法国，学生一年的假期总共长达4个月，但职工的假期只有5个星期，这长长的12个星期差别使许多家庭主妇伤透脑筋！
