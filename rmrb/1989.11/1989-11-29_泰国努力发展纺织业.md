Thailand's textile industry has developed rapidly in recent years, with textile exports leading all other industries for several consecutive years. Last year, the total value of textile exports reached 60.8 billion baht, an increase of 11 billion baht from 1987. This year's export target is 73 billion baht. Economic circles in Bangkok believe that Thailand's textile industry has entered a "golden age."

Although Thailand's textile industry has a long history, it was previously dominated by family-based handicrafts and small-scale textile production of Thai silk, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth, developing slowly. Many textile products had to be imported from abroad. In the early 1970s, the government, in order to reverse the backward situation, encouraged domestic entrepreneurs to introduce foreign capital, technology, and machinery, providing tax exemptions for the import of machinery, allowing foreign technical personnel to reside in Thailand, and providing subsidies for electricity and raw materials to production units, as well as exempting business taxes. These measures promoted the rapid development of Thailand's textile industry. By the late 1970s, Thai textiles not only met domestic market demand but also had a small amount of exports. Entering the 1980s, especially in recent years, textile production has increased severalfold. Due to oversupply in the domestic market, export volumes have significantly increased.

Textiles and ready-made garments are not only found in shops but also in airports, hotels, and on street corners. In Bangkok, there are at least three major wholesale markets—Maha Chai, Samran Rat, and Samran Road. With the development of the textile industry, the central markets continue to expand. Taking "Maha Chai" as an example, in the past, this place was only for self-production and self-sale, with a small scale. Now, a large number of products have flooded in, expanding "Maha Chai" several times. Not only has the "new market" increased, but the early morning market for ready-made garments has also increased. There are now over 600 shops and stalls, with thousands of customers and clients visiting daily. The largest transactions occur in the early morning market, where it is said that 50% of the products come from nearby provinces such as Ayutthaya, Saraburi, Suphan Buri, Nakhon Pathom, and Samut Sakhon. Every day around 4 a.m., these producers bring their products here and then start selling in bulk. In the past, most of those who came to the early morning market to purchase were domestic small traders who would buy early in the morning and then sell in various places. Now, many foreign businessmen also come here to buy in bulk.

The increase in the textile and garment industry's workforce and domestic market competition have driven Thailand's textile industry towards high technology and high standards, allowing more textile products to face the world and enter the international market.

The Thai Textile Industry Group is a good example. The group has achieved a "one-stop" production process from cotton to spinning, weaving, ready-made garments, and exports. The reporter visited part of the group's factories and was deeply impressed.

Mr. Xu believes that while product quality is the key to expanding exports, government encouragement and support are also very important. The government, in order to promote exports, provides "export tax refunds" and other benefits to producers, and helps producers find export markets. In addition, the Department of Commerce's Export Promotion Bureau continuously promotes Thai textiles abroad. Besides holding Thai textile exhibitions at home and abroad, it invites and hosts a large number of foreign businessmen to Thailand each year to visit garment factories and place orders. Due to the joint efforts of the government and private enterprises, Thai textiles are now sold in large quantities to the United States, Europe, Japan, the Middle East, and other Asian countries.

### 泰国努力发展纺织业

　　泰国努力发展纺织业
　　本报记者　刘爱成
    近年来，泰国纺织业发展迅速，产品出口连续数年独占各业鳌头。去年纺织品出口总值已达608亿铢，比1987年增长了110亿铢。今年出口目标是730亿铢。曼谷经济界人士认为，泰国纺织业已进入“黄金时代”。
    泰国纺织业虽有悠久历史，但过去一直以家庭手工或小型纺织业生产泰丝、棉纱和棉布为主，发展缓慢。许多纺织品需从外国进口。70年代初，政府为了扭转落后局面，鼓励国内企业家引进外国资金、技术和机械设备，给予机械设备进口免税，允许外国技术人员在泰居留，给予生产单位电力、原料补贴，并免收营业税。这些措施促进了泰国纺织业的迅速发展。70年代后期，泰国纺织品不仅能满足国内市场需求，还有少量出口。进入80年代，尤其是最近几年，纺织品产量倍增。由于在国内市场上供过于求，出口量大大增加。
    纺织品和成衣不仅在商店，就是在机场、旅馆及街头巷尾也比比皆是。在曼谷，至少有三处以批发为主的大规模中心市场——母马、水门和三聘街。随着纺织业的发展，中心市场仍在扩大。以“母马”为例，过去这里只是自产自销，规模不大。现在大批产品涌到这里，使“母马”扩大了好几倍。不仅增加了“新市场”，还增加了成衣早市场。商店和小摊已达600多家，每天来这里的顾客和客户数以千计。成交额最大的是早市，据说这里50％的产品来自曼谷附近的大城、沙拉武里、素攀、北柳及佛统等府。每天凌晨4点左右，这些生产者把产品运到这里，然后开始成批出售。过去来早市采购的多数为国内小商贩，他们一早购买后再运往各地贩卖。现在许多外国商人也来这里成批采购。
    纺织成衣业人口的增加、国内市场的竞争，促进泰国纺织业向高技术、高水准发展，从而使更多的纺织品面向世界，打入国际市场。
    泰国纺织工业集团便是一例。该集团从棉花——纺纱——织布——成衣——出口已实现了生产“一条龙”。记者参观了该集团的部分工厂，留下深刻印象。
    许先生认为，虽然产品质量是扩大出口的关键，但政府的鼓励和支持也十分重要。政府为了促进出口，对生产者出口产品给予“出口退税”等待遇，并帮助生产者寻找出口市场。此外，商业部出口促进厅为纺织品出口不停地向外宣传，除了在国内外举办泰国纺织品展销会，每年还邀请招待大批外商来泰，参观成衣厂和订货。由于政府和私人企业的共同合作努力，泰国纺织品目前才能大量销售到美国、欧洲、日本、中东及亚洲其他国家。
