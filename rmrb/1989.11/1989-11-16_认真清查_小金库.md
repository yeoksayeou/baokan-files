Recently, the State Council decided to combine the 1989 tax, financial, and price inspection with a comprehensive and thorough investigation and cleanup of the "little cash boxes" privately set up by various departments and units. This is a necessity for the current rectification and adjustment, as well as for the fight against corruption and the strengthening of clean governance.

Any funds that are appropriated or intercepted from state and unit revenues, converted from public to private use, or privately stored without being recorded in the unit's financial and accounting departments, are considered "little cash boxes." Setting up "little cash boxes" is a serious violation of state financial and cash management regulations. In some departments, enterprises, and units, "little cash boxes" hide a large number of illegal and disorderly issues.

Firstly, the sources of funds for "little cash boxes" are often not obtained through legitimate means but through illegal methods to gain illegal income. Some use various names to misappropriate or transfer state budgetary and extra-budgetary revenues; some intercept sales revenue, operating revenue, non-operating revenue, price differential revenue, and other revenues; others gain illegal price differential income through high-price transactions. Even some economic management and supervisory departments violate the law, appropriating and intercepting confiscated revenues. They privately store and hide these illegal revenues under collective or personal names without reporting them.

Secondly, the use of "little cash box" funds is improper, arbitrary, and wasteful. Some people spend money recklessly, buying restricted goods, issuing bonuses above standards, distributing various subsidies, allowances, and bonuses, and paying for various social and travel expenses.

Thirdly, the income and expenditure of "little cash boxes" are not included in the unit's financial and accounting records and are not subject to financial discipline, leading to chaotic management and many loopholes. Some units' "little cash box" funds are misappropriated, privately divided, or even embezzled.

Setting up "little cash boxes" not only causes the loss of state fiscal revenue, leading to the expansion of consumption funds and exacerbating the contradiction between total demand and total supply; more importantly, it encourages extravagance and social inequity, corrupts the ranks of cadres and workers, undermines the Party's and people's integrity, and provides opportunities for various forms of corruption and economic crimes.

In the process of rectification and adjustment, we cannot continue to ignore the increasingly serious problem of privately setting up "little cash boxes." A comprehensive and thorough investigation is necessary.

Investigating "little cash boxes" will inevitably affect the interests of some units and individuals and have a wide impact. To achieve results, the key is for leaders at all levels to raise their awareness, correct their attitudes, and seriously address the issue. They should educate the broad cadre and worker masses, strengthen their legal awareness, and clarify the relationship between the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual. They should recognize the harm of privately setting up "little cash boxes." They should understand that improving welfare and increasing income must be done through legal and proper channels and through our hard work and the improvement of enterprise performance, and not by being obsessed with the benefits of illegal and disciplinary actions. They should consciously fight against the bad practices of squandering state and collective funds.

Through this investigation of privately set up "little cash boxes," we will strictly enforce laws and regulations and recover the illegally appropriated revenues. For those units with serious "little cash box" issues, strict measures will be taken, and the leaders and financial personnel of these units will be held accountable. For those involved in embezzlement, private division, and other criminal acts, they should be handed over to judicial authorities for legal punishment. At the same time, through this investigation, we will bring all financial income and expenditure of various departments and units under proper channels, strictly enforce management systems, and plug loopholes.

    认真清查“小金库”
    本报评论员
    最近，国务院决定结合开展1989年税收财务物价大检查，要对各个部门、各个单位私设的“小金库”进行一次全面彻底的清理和检查。这是当前治理整顿的需要，也是惩治腐败、加强廉政建设的需要。
    凡侵占、截留国家和单位收入，化大公为小公、化公为私，未在本单位财务会计部门列收列支和私存私放的各种资金，均属“小金库”。私设“小金库”，是一种严重违反国家财会制度和现金管理规定的行为。在一些部门、企业和单位的“小金库”中，隐藏着大量违法乱纪的问题。
    其一，“小金库”的资金来源，往往不是通过正当途径获取，而是用非法手段牟取的非法收入。有的以各种名义挪用或转移国家预算内、预算外收入；有的截留销售收入、营业收入、营业外收入、违价收入和其他收入；有的则通过高价倒卖，非法牟取价差收入。甚至一些经济主管部门和监督部门，也执法违法，侵占、截留罚没收入。他们将非法收入以集体或个人名义私存私放，隐匿不报。
    其二，“小金库”资金使用不当，带有很大的随意性和挥霍性。一些人胡支乱花，大手大脚，购置违控商品，超标准发放奖金，滥发实物、津贴、补贴，支付各种交际、旅游费用。
    其三，“小金库”收支不列入本单位财会部门帐目和会计决算，不受财经纪律约束，管理混乱，漏洞很多。一些单位“小金库”资金被挪用，被私分，甚至被贪污。
    私设“小金库”，不仅造成国家财政收入流失，导致消费基金膨胀，加剧了总需求与总供给的矛盾；更重要的是，它助长了奢侈浪费和社会的分配不公，腐蚀干部职工队伍，败坏了党风民风，也给各种腐败现象和经济犯罪活动提供了可乘之机。
    在治理整顿中，我们对越来越严重的私设“小金库”的问题，不能再放任不管。来一次全面彻底的清查，是非常必要的。
    清查“小金库”，必然会触及一些单位、一些个人的利益，影响面广。要取得成果，关键是各级领导要提高认识，端正态度，认真去抓。要教育广大干部职工，加强法制观念，摆正国家、集体、个人三者利益的关系，认识私设“小金库”的危害。要明白这样一个道理，改善福利、增加收入要靠合法的正当的渠道，要靠我们的艰苦奋斗和企业效益的提高，而决不能醉心于违法违纪行为得到的好处，并自觉地同那些慷国家之慨、大肆挥霍国家、集体资财的不良现象作斗争。
    我们要通过这次对私设“小金库”的清查，严肃法纪，把被非法侵占的收入收回来。对那些被查出“小金库”问题大的，性质严重的单位，要从严处理，并追究单位领导和财会责任人员的责任。对有贪污、私分等触犯刑律的，应交司法机关依法惩处。同时，要通过这次清查，把各部门、各单位的各项财务收支纳入正规渠道，严格管理制度，堵塞漏洞。
