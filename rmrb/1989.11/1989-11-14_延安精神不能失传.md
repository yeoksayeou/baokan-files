I am already over seventy years old. In the six years since I retired, I have done some things that I wanted to do but couldn't while I was working. I haven't been idle, and I still feel that time is not enough. Looking around, many of my contemporaries are also busy, and some are doing very well. Even those who are over seventy or eighty, the old revolutionaries and scientists, are still working day and night for the country and the people, dedicating their hearts and souls. Truly, the elderly have a role to play, and they find joy in it. I have been thinking, what kind of spiritual force is supporting this? Is it the inertia of long-term revolution? Then what is the original driving force of this inertia?

Recently, I read a book titled "Selected Studies on the Spirit of Yan'an," and suddenly I understood. Oh! It turns out that today's seventy- and eighty-year-old revolutionary comrades were all nurtured and grown by the spirit of Yan'an—the spirit of the times of the Chinese revolution in the 20th century. Therefore, they still carry this spirit of Yan'an strongly within them today. Comrade Li Weihan emphasized before his passing, "Let the spirit of Yan'an be passed down from generation to generation and shine forever." He said that at that time (the early 1940s), he was still middle-aged, and most people in Yan'an were young, with few elderly people. The few elderly people, the five elders: Dong (Zhou), Lin (Boqu), Xie (Jueying), Wu (Yuzhang), and Xu (Teli), were only around sixty years old at the time. However, the five elders' exemplary conduct, hard work, diligence, and pioneering spirit of entrepreneurship had a significant role in guiding and mentoring the middle-aged and young cadres at that time, which can be said to be an important part of the spirit of Yan'an.

Take one example: In the autumn of 1939, Comrade Xu once used the analogy of the five fingers of a hand and the scissors to explain the dialectical view of opposites, which later helped me to have a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between "one divides into two and two combine into one." At a time when the whole party is emphasizing the need to learn some Marxist philosophical thoughts, revisiting Comrade Xu's simple dialectical view of opposites seems to have practical significance.

Chairman Mao always opposed others celebrating his birthday, but he enthusiastically celebrated the 60th, 70th, and 80th birthdays of his teacher, Comrade Xu Teli. Why did Chairman Mao respect Comrade Xu so much? Chairman Mao said: "From that time (referring to Comrade Xu Teli joining the Communist Party in 1927) to now, through long-term arduous struggles, you have been more active than many young and middle-aged party members, more fearless of difficulties, and more eager to learn new things. What 'old age,' what 'weak body and spirit,' what 'difficulties and obstacles,' all have been subdued in your presence."

Of course, I am not advocating that old comrades, regardless of their age and health, should all strive to struggle. I hope we can all take care of our health, live long, and contribute according to our abilities, seeking truth from facts. However, at this time, I heard some sayings, such as "forty-seven or forty-eight, it's useless to work; fifty-seven or fifty-eight, wait to go home," and I was taken aback. How precious are forty-seven or forty-eight and fifty-seven or fifty-eight! This is still a time when much can be done. We were at that age during the "unprecedented" ten years, and now we need to make up for the losses of those ten years, so we feel that it's not useless to work and that we still need to work even after going home. If I could go back to forty-seven or forty-eight and fifty-seven or fifty-eight, I would strive to work. But upon careful investigation, it is indeed understandable. Some departments, places, and units do have some one-sidedness in their treatment of comrades who are forty-seven or forty-eight and fifty-seven or fifty-eight. Of course, there are both objective reasons and subjective factors here. However, based on the party's policy of building socialist spiritual civilization, I think it is more important to greatly carry forward the spirit of hard work and seeking truth from facts in Yan'an. Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasized in "Implementing the Adjustment Policy and Ensuring Stability and Unity": "We must propagate, restore, and carry forward the spirit of Yan'an, the spirit of the early days of liberation, and the spirit of overcoming difficulties in the early 1960s. 'We in Yan'an had nothing, everything was difficult... we followed the method proposed by Chairman Mao Zedong of 'self-reliance, clothing and food in abundance'... and as a result, all difficulties were overcome, and life was very good. Now China does not need to do it completely like that, but that spirit is still needed.'"

However, after several "leftist" political movements, especially the ten-year "Cultural Revolution," and the recent spread of bourgeois liberalization, the spirit of Yan'an has been gradually worn down, to the point where many old comrades today lament: After a few more years, when we pass away one by one, will the spirit of Yan'an not be lost? I think this feeling is not alarmist, nor is it groundless worry, nor is it dogmatic preaching. Looking at the world today, even the Soviet theoretical circles have proposed the need to restore the traditions of the October Revolution. We ourselves created and nurtured the spirit of Yan'an, and we must pass it down from generation to generation.

    延安精神不能失传
    田方
    我是已经过了七十的人了。离休六年来，做了一些在职时期想做而做不到的事，没有闲着，还感到时间很不够用。环顾四周，我们同龄人中，大多都在忙着，有的还干得十分出色。甚至过了七八十岁的老一辈革命家、科学家，今天都还在为国家、为人民日夜操劳，呕心沥血。真是老有所用，乐在其中。我在寻思，这究竟是一种什么精神力量支撑着的？是长期革命的一种惯性吗？那么这种惯性的原动力又是从哪里来的呢？
    最近读了一本《延安精神研究文选》，才恍然大悟。噢！原来今天的七八十岁的革命老同志，都是那种延安精神——二十世纪中国革命的时代精神哺育成长起来的。因此，他们今天身上仍然浓烈地充满着这种延安精神。李维汉同志生前曾十分强调“让延安精神代代相传，永放光芒”。他说他当时（四十年代初期）还是中年人，延安大多数是青年人，老年人不多，仅有的五老：董老（必武）、林老（伯渠）、谢老（觉哉）、吴老（玉章）、徐老（特立），当时也只不过六十岁左右。但是五老那种身教言传、艰苦奋斗、奋发图强、勇于开拓的创业精神，对于当时中青年干部的传帮带作用，可以说是延安精神的一个重要组成部分。
    以一事为例：1939年秋季的一天，徐老曾经用人的五个指头为什么要大拇指和另四指分立，为什么剪刀要左右相对的通俗比喻，讲解对立统一的辩证观点，以致后来使我对于“一分为二和合二而一”的关系有了比较全面的理解。在全党目前正强调学一点马克思主义哲学思想的时候，重温徐老这种通俗的对立统一的辩证观点，似乎是具有现实意义的。
    毛主席一直反对别人为他做寿，但对于他的先生徐特立同志的六十、七十、八十寿辰，都是热烈祝贺的。毛主席为什么对徐老如此尊重呢？毛主席说：“从那时（指徐特立同志于1927年加入共产党之时）至今长期艰苦斗争中，你比许多青年壮年党员还要积极，还要不怕困难，还要虚心学习新的东西。什么‘老’，什么‘身体精神不行’，什么‘困难障碍’，在你面前都降服了。”
    当然，我这里并不是鼓吹老同志们不顾年迈体弱，都去勉强拚搏，我更希望我们大家都能保重身体，健康长寿，量力而行，实事求是地发挥我们的余热。但是，正在此时，听到一些顺口溜，说什么“四十七、八，干也白搭；五十七、八，等着回家”，感到有些愕然。多么可贵的四十七、八和五十七、八呀！这还是大有可为的时候。我们那个年岁正是在那“史无前例”的十年中过去的，现在正要弥补那十年的损失，所以感到干也不是白搭，回家也还是要干的。如果让我再回到四十七、八和五十七、八，那我拚命也要干的。但是仔细一了解，也的确不以为怪，有些部门、有些地方、有些单位，对待那些四十七、八和五十七、八的同志确实有些片面性。当然，这里既有客观原因，也有主观因素。但是，根据党的关于建设社会主义精神文明的方针，我觉得更重要的还是要大大发扬艰苦奋斗、实事求是的延安精神。邓小平同志在《贯彻调整方针，保证安定团结》一文中曾经强调：“我们一定要宣传、恢复和发扬延安精神，解放初期的精神，以及六十年代初期克服困难的精神。”“我们在延安时，什么都困难，什么东西都没有……就是照毛泽东主席提出的‘自己动手，丰衣足食’的方法去做……结果困难都克服了，生活过得很好。现在中国不需要完全那样做了，但那种精神仍然需要。”
    然而，经过历次“左”的政治运动，特别是十年“文化大革命”，以及近年来资产阶级自由化的泛滥，延安精神被逐步磨损了，以致今天不少老同志在感叹：再过若干年以后，当我们相继谢世之时，延安精神岂不就要失传了？我想，这种感觉决不是危言耸听，也不是杞人忧天，更不是教条主义的说教。环顾当今世界，苏联理论界也有人提出了要恢复十月革命的传统。我们自己创造而又哺育我们自己的传家宝——延安精神，我们一定要代代相传。
