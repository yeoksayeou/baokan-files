	Why the Long Line of Vehicles

	At the end of August, we were in Hunan Province. We took a bus from Xinhua County to Longhui County. When we reached the section of the road near the village of Guandu in Baidiang Township, traffic was blocked, and vehicles were lined up in a long queue. We found out that a truck had gotten stuck in a water diversion ditch that crossed the road. Some local people took advantage of this situation, made a few modifications to the ditch, and began to illegally collect "toll" fees from passing vehicles. If you didn't pay, you weren't allowed to pass. If you tried to take a detour, you would be stopped. The drivers had arguments with them. According to drivers and passengers who frequently travel this route, incidents where unidentified individuals use threats and intimidation to forcibly stop cars and rob drivers and passengers of their money frequently occur on the Xinhua-Longhui road.

    为何排起长蛇阵
    8月底，我们在湖南，乘坐从新化县开往隆回县的班车，行至白塘乡官渡村一组地段时交通受阻，车辆排成长蛇阵。了解后得知，有一辆卡车陷进横穿马路的引水沟里，当地一些人便利用此事在引水沟上稍加修整，强行向过往车辆收取过“路”费，不交钱不准通过，绕道行驶则受阻拦，驾驶员与之发生了争执。据经常过往这条线路的驾驶员和乘客谈，在新（化）隆（回）公路上，不明身份者采取威胁、恫吓等手段强行阻拦汽车、劫取司机及乘客钱财的事件时有发生。
