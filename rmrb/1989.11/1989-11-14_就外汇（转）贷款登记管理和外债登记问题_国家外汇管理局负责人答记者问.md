Recently, the head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange responded to questions from Xinhua News Agency reporters regarding the publication and implementation of the "Foreign Exchange (Transfer) Loan Registration Management Measures" and the "Foreign Debt Registration Implementation Details."

Q: What is the purpose of publishing the "Measures" and the "Details"?

A: The "Measures" are a new set of regulations for the registration and management of indirect debt. Publishing and implementing these "Measures" will help various provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and central departments understand their foreign exchange debt situations and the specific directions and uses of funds, ensuring that they make scientific decisions when using foreign debt funds and improving the efficiency of foreign debt usage. This is an important measure to improve the foreign debt statistical monitoring system.

The "Details" were formulated to implement the "Temporary Regulations on Foreign Debt Statistical Monitoring" published by our bureau on August 27, 1987, and are specific regulations for the registration and management of direct foreign debt. Publishing and implementing these "Details" will help improve the transparency of China's foreign debt management, making it easier for borrowing units and relevant banks to understand and familiarize themselves with the specific practices and procedures of foreign debt registration management, and ensuring the timeliness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy of foreign debt statistical monitoring.

Q: What is the scope of application of the "Details"?

A: The regulations and procedures in the "Details" are uniform, so they apply to both direct foreign debt registration and the registration management of foreign exchange (transfer) loans.

Q: What is the specific concept of foreign exchange (transfer) loans? How do they differ from direct foreign debt?

A: Foreign exchange (transfer) loans refer to domestic foreign exchange funds used by domestic units that have contractual repayment obligations in foreign currency. In other words, the creditor of a foreign exchange (transfer) loan is a domestic unit, and the debtor is the project unit that uses the loan and bears the repayment responsibility in foreign currency. The creditor of direct foreign debt is an overseas institution, and the debtor is a domestic unit that borrows directly from overseas.

Q: What are the differences in the materials required for registration between foreign exchange (transfer) loans and direct loans?

A: When registering a foreign exchange (transfer) loan, the debtor only needs to provide the transfer loan agreement or loan contract to the registration department to complete the registration procedures. When registering direct foreign debt, the debtor must provide the loan contract to the registration department and also provide the foreign loan approval document (excluding foreign-invested enterprises) before the registration can be completed.

Q: How should foreign exchange (transfer) loans used by central units stationed in local areas be registered?

A: The registration of foreign exchange (transfer) loans used by central units stationed in local areas can be handled in three ways:

First, if the headquarters is responsible for borrowing and repaying the transfer loan, the headquarters will handle the registration.

Second, if the headquarters is responsible for borrowing the transfer loan but the local unit is responsible for repayment, or if the local unit borrows the transfer loan and is responsible for repayment but the foreign exchange receipts and payments are unrelated to the local area, the local unit will handle the registration on behalf of the local foreign exchange administration department.

Third, if the foreign exchange receipts and payments and repayment responsibilities of the unit stationed in the local area are related to the local area, the unit stationed in the local area will handle the registration.

    就外汇（转）贷款登记管理和外债登记问题
    国家外汇管理局负责人答记者问
    新华社北京11月12日电　最近，国家外汇管理局负责人就公布实施《外汇（转）贷款登记管理办法》和《外债登记实施细则》回答了新华社记者的提问。
    问：公布《办法》和《细则》的目的是什么？
    答：《办法》是对间接债务的登记管理办法，是一项新的办法。公布实施这一《办法》，有助于各省、市、自治区和中央各部门了解各自的外汇债务情况和资金的具体投向及用途，保证他们在使用外债资金方面进行科学的决策，提高外债的使用效益。这是完善外债统计监测系统的重要措施。
    《细则》是为贯彻1987年8月27日我局公布的《外债统计监测暂行规定》而制订的，是直接外债登记管理的具体规定。公布实施这一《细则》，有助于提高我国外债管理的透明度，便于借款单位和有关银行了解和熟悉外债登记管理的具体做法和程序，保障外债统计监测的及时、全面和准确。
    问：《细则》适用于哪些范围？
    答：《细则》中的规定和手续都是统一的，因此它既适用于直接外债登记，也适用于外汇（转）贷款的登记管理。
    问：外汇（转）贷款的具体概念是什么？它与直接外债有什么区别？
    答：外汇（转）贷款是指境内单位使用的以外币承担的具有契约性偿还义务的国内外汇资金。也就是说，外汇（转）贷款的债权人是境内单位，债务人是使用贷款、并以外币承担偿还责任的项目单位。而直接外债的债权人是境外机构，债务人是直接从境外借入外借的境内单位。
    问：外汇（转）贷款与直接借款在登记时，提供的材料有什么区别？
    答：外汇（转）贷款在进行登记时，债务人只需向登记部门提供转贷协议或借款合同，即可办理登记手续。而直接外债在进行登记时，债务人除向登记部门提供借款合同外，还须提供对外借款批件（外商投资企业除外），才能办理登记手续。
    问：中央驻地方单位使用的外汇（转）贷款如何进行登记？
    答：中央驻地方单位使用的外汇（转）贷款，其登记可分三种情况办理：
    第一种，由其总部负责转贷款的借入和偿还的，由其总部负责登记。
    第二种，由其总部负责转贷款的借入，但由地方单位负责偿还的；或由地方单位自行借入转贷款、自行负责偿还，而其外汇收支与地方无关的，由地方单位在所在地外管部门代理登记。
    第三种，驻地方单位的外汇收支及偿还责任与地方有关时，由驻地方单位登记。
