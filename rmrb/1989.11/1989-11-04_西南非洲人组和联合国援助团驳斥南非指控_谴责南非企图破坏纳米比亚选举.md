	SWAPO and UNTAG Rebut South Africa's Accusations
	Condemn South Africa's Attempt to Sabotage Namibian Elections

	HARARE, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- SWAPO Secretary-General Toivo ja Toivo on Nov. 1 firmly denied South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha's claim that SWAPO had amassed troops along the northern border of Namibia.

	He said this was another lie fabricated by the South African government to disrupt the upcoming elections in Namibia.

	Pik Botha had earlier stated that, according to intercepted communications from the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG), SWAPO's armed forces had entered the northern border of Namibia.

	Therefore, South African armed forces had been put on alert.

	The UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, yesterday denied that there was any information in UNTAG communications about SWAPO troops crossing the Angolan border into northern Namibia.

	Ahtisaari said his office had reviewed the communications provided by the South African government, which were purported to be internal UNTAG documents, and found that these communications were not issued by any UNTAG agency.

	SWAPO's spokesman, Hidipo Hamutenya, said yesterday in Windhoek that South Africa's claim that SWAPO had amassed troops along the northern border was pure fabrication. South Africa used this as a pretext to threaten to send troops into Namibia, with the aim of derailing Namibia's independence process.

	He said this was a smokescreen by South Africa to disrupt and interfere with the election results.

	Hamutenya called on the United Nations and the two superpowers to exert pressure on the South African authorities to ensure that the Namibian people could choose their future government according to their own will.

    西南非洲人组和联合国援助团驳斥南非指控
    谴责南非企图破坏纳米比亚选举
    本报哈拉雷11月3日电  记者李景卫报道：西南非洲人民组织总书记托伊沃1日对南非外长皮克·博塔关于西南非洲人民组织在纳米比亚北部边境集结部队之说予以了坚决的否认。
    他说，这是南非政府企图破坏纳米比亚选举所编造的又一谎言。
    南非外长皮克·博塔前天说，根据南非政府截取的联合国过渡时期援助团的电讯表明，西南非洲人民组织武装力量已进入纳米比亚北部边境。
    因此，南非武装部队已进入戒备状态。
    联合国秘书长关于纳米比亚事务的特别代表阿赫蒂萨里昨天否认在联合国过渡时期援助团的电讯中有任何关于西南非洲人民组织部队越过安哥拉边界，进入纳米比亚北部的消息。
    阿赫蒂萨里说，他的办公室对南非政府提供的并断言是所谓援助团的内部电讯稿进行了审查，结果证实这些电讯稿并非援助团任何机构发出的。
    西南非洲人民组织新闻秘书哈穆泰尼亚昨天在温得和克说，南非所谓的西南非洲人民组织在北部边境集结军队纯属捏造。南非以此为借口，威胁要调兵到纳米比亚，其目的是要使纳米比亚独立进程流产。
    他说，这是南非施放的一颗烟幕弹，旨在破坏和干扰选举结果。
    哈穆泰尼亚呼吁联合国及两个超级大国对南非当局施加压力，以保证纳米比亚人民能够按照自己的意愿选择将来的政府。
