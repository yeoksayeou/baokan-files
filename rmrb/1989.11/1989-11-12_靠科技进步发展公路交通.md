To accelerate the development of road transportation, we must, on the one hand, change the irrational investment structure of transportation construction, and on the other hand, rely on technological progress. The historical experience of China's road construction proves that breakthroughs in some key technologies will greatly promote the development of road transportation. In the 1960s, the development and promotion of three key technologies—thin-layer asphalt pavement, double-curvature arch bridges, and drilled and poured piles for road bridges—significantly advanced the widespread construction of roads in China.

Since the 1980s, China has entered a new era of high-grade road construction. We are not only facing insufficient construction funds but also the prominent contradiction of lacking road materials and high technical requirements. To address this, we have developed three new key technologies. The road design department has developed and applied a comprehensive technology that combines aerial surveying with computer-aided design systems, significantly accelerating the surveying and design speed and improving the quality of surveying and design. Compared to conventional line design methods, the design speed is generally increased by more than 20 times, saving 10% of earthwork and rockwork, and reducing engineering costs by 10% to 15%.

During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, semi-rigid base layers and heavy-duty asphalt pavement structures were developed, which can significantly reduce the thickness of the asphalt layer, saving more than 10% of the total construction cost and extending the service life of the road surface.

During the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period, we should, based on China's actual situation, focus on developing advanced and applicable technologies, including conducting soft science research on road traffic planning, evaluation, and decision support systems; developing and manufacturing large-scale road construction and maintenance machinery; and researching and promoting fuel-saving technologies. To this end, we should further increase investment in road transportation technology, accelerate the promotion and application of new technologies, and make technological progress truly the driving force for the development of road transportation.

    靠科技进步发展公路交通
    交通部科技司副司长　张叔辉
    为加速公路交通的发展，一方面要改变不合理的交通建设的投资结构，另一方面要依靠科技进步。我国公路建设的历史经验证明，一些关键技术的突破会大大促进公路交通事业的发展。60年代的薄层渣油路面、公路双曲拱桥和公路桥梁钻孔灌注桩三项关键技术的开发和推广应用，推动我国的公路普及建设有了突飞式的发展。
    80年代以来，我国进入了高等级公路建设的新时期。我们面临的不仅是建设资金不足，还有缺乏符合要求的道路材料、技术要求高等突出矛盾，为此又开发了三项新的关键技术。公路设计部门开发应用航测和计算机辅助设计系统相结合的综合技术，大大加快测设速度，提高测设质量。与常规的线路设计方法相比，一般说设计速率提高20倍以上，节省土石方量10％，工程费用可降低10％—15％。高等级公路对路面提出平整、坚实、防滑、耐磨、稳定、耐久的技术要求，“七五”期间研究开发了半刚性基层、重交通道路沥青路面结构，可大大减薄沥青层面厚度，路面总造价节约10％以上，使用期大大延长。
    “八五”期间，要从我国的实际情况出发，重点发展先进适用技术，包括开展公路交通规划、评价与决策支持系统的软科学研究；开发研制大生产能力路面施工机械和养护机械；研究和推广节油技术等。为此，应进一步加大对公路交通科技投入，加速新技术的推广应用，使技术进步真正成为公路交通发展的原动力。
