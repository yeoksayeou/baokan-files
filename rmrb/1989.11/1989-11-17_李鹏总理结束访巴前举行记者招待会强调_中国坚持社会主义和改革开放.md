Premier Li Peng held a press conference in Rawalpindi this morning, emphasizing that China will continue to follow the socialist path and will not close the door to reform and opening up. He stated that China will not close its own door to reform and opening up, and no other country can close China's door.

At this press conference, Premier Li Peng comprehensively answered many questions posed by foreign journalists. When discussing China's relations with Western countries, Premier Li Peng said that some Western countries have recently imposed economic sanctions on China, which will inevitably have some impact on China's economy. However, from another perspective, these sanctions will also affect the sanctioning countries themselves. China's policy of reform and opening up will not change. Our reforms aim to make the socialist system more perfect; our opening up is because we believe China should not be isolated and should seek friendship and peace worldwide, learning advanced technology, management experience, and good culture from other countries to accelerate the pace of China's modernization. The current Western economic sanctions are essentially political sanctions, attempting to influence China to change its socialist system. The Chinese people will not yield to these pressures and will not compromise on principles. The temporary difficulties brought by Western economic sanctions mainly affect the speed of development and cannot crush China's economy. Our economy is based on self-reliance and relies on our own strength to build the country. China will not close its own door to reform and opening up, and no other country can close China's door. I believe that more and more enlightened people around the world have realized that sanctioning China is not only ineffective but also unwise. We adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy and are willing to develop friendly relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, including Western countries.

Regarding Sino-American relations, Premier Li Peng said that since 1972, the two countries have begun to restore normal relations, and over the past decade or so, the relationship has developed relatively smoothly. Now, Western countries are imposing economic sanctions on China, with the United States leading the way. China has done nothing wrong to the United States; instead, the United States owes China. China will not compromise on principles and still hopes to improve relations with the United States.

When asked about China's evaluation of the developments in East Germany, Premier Li Peng replied that first, one should not link the events in East Germany with those in China, as there are many differences between the two. Recently, there have been some astonishing changes in Eastern Europe, including East Germany, and the world is closely watching the developments in these countries. China, of course, is concerned about these events. China has always respected the sovereignty of other countries and does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries or the internal affairs of sister parties that maintain friendly relations with the Communist Party of China. This is one of our fundamental principles. China has always believed that countries practicing the socialist system should formulate their own policies based on their actual situation and the interests of their people. As for the current developments in Eastern Europe, we still need to observe carefully. In evaluating these events, we should not only consider the system but, more importantly, whether these events are conducive to the stability and development of Europe and the peace and prosperity of the world.

Regarding the Afghanistan issue, Premier Li Peng said that the Chinese government and people have always supported the just cause of the Afghan resistance forces. We are pleased to see that Soviet troops have completely withdrawn from Afghanistan. We believe that the establishment of a broadly-based united government through consultations among various factions is the correct way to resolve the Afghanistan issue. In this way, millions of Afghan refugees stranded abroad can return home and live in peace. The Chinese government will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Afghan refugees to the best of its ability.

When asked about the cooperation between China and Pakistan in building a nuclear power plant, Premier Li Peng revealed that the two premiers had agreed in principle to the construction of a 300,000-kilowatt nuclear power plant in Pakistan by China. According to the agreement between the two countries on cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy, this facility will be placed under the safety guarantees and supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Experts from both sides will soon discuss and determine some necessary details to expedite the implementation of this project.

When discussing the relations between China and Pakistan, China and India, and Pakistan and India, Premier Li Peng said that China-Pakistan relations have withstood the test of history, and the friendly cooperation between the two countries is a model of peaceful coexistence and cooperation between different social systems. Both China and Pakistan have a common desire to develop and strengthen friendship between the two countries. Last year, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit to China marked the normalization of Sino-Indian relations. The two premiers have agreed to resolve border issues between the two countries through negotiations. The improvement of Sino-Indian relations is not directed against any third country, and China's friendly relations with other countries in South Asia will not change. India is a major power in South Asia, and China hopes that India and other countries in South Asia will resolve disputes between countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence to maintain peace and stability in the South Asian region.

    李鹏总理结束访巴前举行记者招待会强调
    中国坚持社会主义和改革开放
    本报伊斯兰堡11月16日电  记者任毓骏、史宗星报道：李鹏总理今天上午在拉瓦尔品第举行记者招待会时强调指出，中国将坚持走社会主义道路，中国绝不会自己关上改革开放的大门，也没有任何一个国家能把中国的大门关上。
    在这次记者招待会上，李鹏总理全面回答了许多外国记者提出的问题。在谈到中国和西方国家的关系时，李鹏总理说，近来一些西方国家对中国实行经济制裁，这肯定会对中国经济产生一些影响，但从另一个角度看，这种制裁也会给制裁者本身带来影响。中国实行改革开放政策，这个政策我们不会变。我们改革，就是要使社会主义制度更加完善；我们开放，是因为我们认为中国不应该孤立，应该在全世界寻求友谊，寻求和平，学习世界上其他国家的先进技术，先进管理经验，包括一些好的文化，使中国四个现代化建设步伐更快一些。现在西方所谓的经济制裁实质上是政治制裁，企图影响中国改变社会主义制度。我们中国人民是不会屈服于这些压力的，是不会拿原则作交易的。西方经济制裁给中国带来的暂时困难，主要是影响发展速度，不可能把中国经济压垮。我们的经济是以自力更生为主，靠自己的力量建设国家。中国不会自己关上改革开放的大门，也没有任何一个国家能把中国的大门关上。我相信世界上越来越多的有识之士已看出对中国制裁，第一没有用，第二是不明智的。我们奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，中国愿意在和平共处五项原则基础上同世界上一切国家发展友好关系，其中当然也包括西方国家。
    关于中美关系，李鹏总理说，从1972年开始，两国开始恢复正常关系，十多年来应该说发展比较平稳。现在西方国家对中国实行经济制裁，美国带了头。中国没有做任何对不起美国的事情，而是美国欠了中国的账。中国第一不会拿原则作交易，第二依然希望和美国改善关系。
    有记者问到中国对民主德国事态发展作何评价时，李鹏总理回答说，首先不应该把民主德国发生的事件和中国发生的事件联系起来，因为两者有许多不同之处。近来在东欧包括民主德国发生了一些惊人的变化，全世界都关注这些国家事态的发展，中国理所当然对这些事件表示关注。中国一贯不干涉别国内政，也不干涉和中国共产党保持友好关系的兄弟党的内部事务。这是我们的一项基本原则。中国一贯认为，实行社会主义制度的国家，应该根据自己的实际情况和本国人民的利益制定自己的政策。现在对东欧发生的事态究竟作何评价，我们还应仔细观察。判断这些事件，不仅要从制度上考虑，更重要的是要看这些事件是否有利于欧洲的稳定与发展及全世界的和平与繁荣。
    关于阿富汗问题，李鹏总理说，中国政府和中国人民一贯支持阿富汗抵抗力量的正义事业。我们高兴地看到，苏联军队已经全部从阿富汗撤出。我们认为，通过各派力量之间的协商成立一个有广泛基础的联合政府，是解决阿富汗问题的正确途径。这样，滞留在国外的数百万阿富汗难民就可以重返家园，过和平的生活。中国政府将继续为阿富汗难民提供力所能及的人道主义援助。
    有记者问到中巴合作建造核电站时，李鹏总理透露说，两国总理原则同意由中国在巴基斯坦合作建造30万千瓦核电站。根据两国间的关于和平利用原子能合作协议，这项设施将置于国际原子能机构的安全保障和监督之下。双方的专家不久即将讨论和确定一些必要的细节，以便尽快地落实这一项目。
    在谈到中巴、中印和巴印关系时，李鹏总理说，中巴关系是经过历史考验的，中巴之间的友好合作堪称不同社会制度之间和平共处和合作的楷模，中巴都有一个共同的愿望，那就是发展和巩固两国之间的友谊。去年拉吉夫·甘地总理访华，标志着中印关系开始正常化。两国总理都表示同意通过谈判协商解决两国间的边界问题。中印改善关系不针对第三国，中国和南亚其他国家的友好关系不会变化。印度是南亚大国，中国希望印度和南亚其他国家在和平共处五项原则基础上协商解决国与国之间的争端，以保持南亚地区的和平稳定。
