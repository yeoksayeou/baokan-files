**People's Daily, Kathmandu, November 20th**

The usually tranquil valley of Phulchowki today echoed with laughter and joy, filled with the warm and friendly atmosphere between the peoples of China and Nepal.

At 10:30 AM, Premier Li Peng and his wife, amidst the cheers of thousands of villagers and children, arrived at the Royal Botanical Garden in Nepal. They each planted a "Sino-Nepal Friendship Tree," leaving a lasting memorial of their friendly visit to Nepal.

When the Chinese guests arrived, the local council chairman and garden staff lined up at the entrance of a small bridge to welcome them, offering flowers or pressing their palms together in a traditional greeting to express their sincere welcome to Premier Li. Subsequently, Premier Li and his wife walked along a red carpet to their designated planting spots, shoveling the earth, covering the roots, and watering the trees. The onlookers from both countries applauded enthusiastically. The two trees they planted are called "TANKI" in English, but no one present knew its Chinese translation. Premier Li humorously said, "We planted a friendship tree, but we don't know its name," which elicited laughter from everyone.

The Royal Botanical Garden was established in 1962, selected and inaugurated by the late King Mahendra. Its area has expanded over the years, now covering 84 hectares, cultivating over 2,000 species of local trees and rare flowers, and collecting more than 1,600 species of foreign plants. Surrounded by mountains, the garden is serene and tranquil, making it a popular tourist spot and an ideal place for foreign dignitaries to plant trees and leave mementos.

Premier Li surveyed the surrounding scenery and said to the photographers, "The scenery here is beautiful; let's take a photo!" He first took a photo with Zhu Lin, and then took group photos with all the Chinese and Nepalese friends present.

When Premier Li rested under a canopy in the garden, the host introduced that since the establishment of the garden, it has received many foreign leaders, with the most frequent visitors being from China. Since 1978, Chinese leaders such as Deng Xiaoping and Li Xiannian have all planted trees here. Today, Premier Li Peng and his wife planted two more trees, which made the host very happy. The host later expressed, "May the friendship between the peoples of Nepal and China be everlasting like the trees we planted today, and as beautiful as the flowers they will bloom."

Since Premier Li arrived in Kathmandu yesterday, Sino-Nepalese friendship has been the dominant topic here. Whether among various circles or in the media, everyone has expressed their fervent feelings and words of praise for the close and intimate relationship between the two countries. Prime Minister Shreshta praised the friendship, saying it is "deeply rooted in a long history of friendship and understanding," and that Premier Li's visit is "a new milestone in Sino-Nepalese relations." Foreign Minister Upadhyaya told the *Naya Prokash* newspaper, "Nepal and China are not only neighbors but also close friends," and that Sino-Nepalese relations have never been affected by international political changes. Former Prime Minister Bista, former Foreign Minister Shahi, former Ambassador to China Keshari, and current Ambassador to China Khatri all spoke to the press, concluding from their personal experiences that "Nepal and China are friends who share joys and sorrows."

Although Premier Li's visit to Nepal was brief, it was fruitful. His talks with Prime Minister Shreshta and the ongoing private meeting with King Birendra tonight were not only very friendly but also reached broad consensus on issues of mutual concern. As Premier Li had hoped upon arriving at Kathmandu Airport yesterday, his visit has further strengthened and developed the already close and friendly relationship between China and Nepal.

### 绿树常青　友谊永存

　　绿树常青　友谊永存
　　本报记者　史宗星
    一向寂静的富尔乔基山谷，今天回荡着阵阵欢语笑声，洋溢着中尼两国人民亲切的浓郁气氛。
    上午10时30分，李鹏总理和夫人在成千上万村民和儿童的夹道欢迎中，来到这里的尼泊尔皇家植物园，各自栽了一棵“尼中友谊树”，为他们这次对尼泊尔的友好访问留下了永久的纪念。
    中国客人抵达时，当地评议会主席和植物园工作人员在一座小桥的桥头上列队迎接，或献上鲜花，或双手合十，向李总理表达了真诚的欢迎。随后，李总理和夫人沿红地毯走到各自的植树地点，挥锹挖坑，培土浇水，在场的中尼两国朋友为此热烈鼓掌。他们栽下的两棵树，外文名字叫“TANKI”，在场的人都说不出它的中文译名，李总理风趣地说：“栽了友谊树，但不知其名。”引起大家一阵笑声。
    皇家植物园始建于1962年，经已故国王马亨德拉选定，并由他本人主持了建园仪式。占地面积逐年扩大，目前已达84公顷，栽培着2000多种本国树木和珍奇花卉，还收集了1600多种外国植物。此地群山环抱，环境清幽，因此成了旅游胜地和外国贵宾植树留念的好地方。
    李总理环视周围青山秀景，对摄影记者说：“这里风景好，照张相吧！”他先和朱琳合照一张，接着又分批同在场的所有中尼两国朋友合影留念。
    当李总理坐在植物园里的凉棚里休息时，主人向他介绍说，自建国以来，这里接待过不少外国领导人，其中来自中国的贵宾最多。自1978年以来，邓小平、李先念等中国领导人都来这里栽过树。李鹏总理和夫人今天又在这里植了两棵树，他为此感到非常高兴。这位主人后来又深情地说：“祝愿尼中两国人民的友谊像今天栽的树一样常青，也像它今后开放的花朵一样美丽。”
    自从李总理昨天来到加德满都以来，尼中友好便成了这里压倒一切的话题。不论是各界人士，还是新闻媒介，都以炽热的感情和语言赞颂两国间亲密无间的关系。什雷斯塔首相称颂两国友好“深深扎根于悠久的友谊和谅解的历史之中”，李鹏总理的访问是“尼中关系的又一新的里程碑”。外交大臣乌帕德亚雅对《新兴尼泊尔报》发表谈话说，“尼中两国不仅是近邻，而且是亲密的朋友”，尼中关系从未因国际风云的变幻而受过影响。前首相比斯塔、前外交大臣沙希、前驻华大使凯西和现任驻华大使卡特里都向报界发表了谈话，以他们的切身体会得出了这样的结论：“尼中两国是同甘共苦共患难的朋友”。
    李鹏总理此次对尼泊尔的访问虽然非常短暂，但富有成果。他同什雷斯塔首相的会谈以及今晚正在进行的同比兰德拉国王的单独会见，不仅气氛十分亲切友好，而且就双方共同关心的问题达成了广泛一致的看法。正如李总理昨天抵达加德满都机场时所期望的，他的这次访问，使中尼两国之间业已存在的亲密友好关系得到了进一步巩固和发展。（本报加德满都
