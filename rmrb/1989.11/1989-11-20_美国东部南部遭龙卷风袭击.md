On November 15th and 16th, approximately ten states in the eastern and southern regions of the United States experienced severe tornadoes. The storms resulted in at least twenty-six deaths, over five hundred injuries, and left more than a thousand people homeless.

The city of Huntsville in Alabama was the hardest hit, with seventeen confirmed deaths following last night's storm. In Newburgh, New York, the walls of a primary school collapsed this afternoon due to the high winds, killing seven students and injuring eighteen others.
