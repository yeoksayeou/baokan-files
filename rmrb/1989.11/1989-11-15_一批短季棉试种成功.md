A batch of short-season cotton trials succeed

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 14th—Reporter Wang Yougong reports: “Zhongmian 642” and other varieties of short-season cotton (sown one month later than spring-sown cotton) have been successfully trialed, providing a new approach for the Huang-Huai-Hai region to resolve the conflict between grain and cotton cultivation and achieve both cotton production and increased grain yield.

	The Huang-Huai-Hai Plain is a major grain and cotton production base in China, with an annual cotton planting area of 48 million mu. Traditionally, the region practices a single-crop system for cotton production. However, in recent years, the conflict between grain and cotton cultivation has become prominent, making it difficult to ensure the cotton planting area. To explore new paths for dual harvests of grain and cotton in the region, the National Seed Station, the Cotton Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, seed stations in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and related cities and counties formed a joint development team. They conducted research on new varieties and supporting technologies for short-season cotton in the Huang-Huai-Hai region. After two years of trials, they initially screened out short-season new varieties such as “Zhongmian 117,” “Zhongmian 375,” “Zhongmian 642,” and “Wanxia 1,” along with supporting wheat varieties like “Suyu 1.” This allows for the simultaneous high-quality and high-yield harvesting of cotton while increasing wheat production by 250 kilograms per mu of cotton field. Experts believe that by adopting matching varieties and supporting technologies to reform the planting system and increase the cropping index, the conflict between grain and cotton cultivation in the region can be significantly alleviated.

	According to experts' calculations, if 70% of the 48 million mu of cotton fields in the Huang-Huai-Hai region adopt the wheat-cotton relay cropping system, it will be possible to ensure cotton production while increasing wheat production by 8.4 billion kilograms annually, adding economic benefits of over 3 billion yuan.

    一批短季棉试种成功
    本报北京11月14日讯　记者王友恭报道：“中棉642”等一批短季棉（比春播棉晚种一个月）试种成功，为黄淮海地区解决粮棉争地，实现保棉增粮找到了新途径。
    黄淮海平原是我国主要粮棉生产基地，常年植棉面积4800万亩。该地区棉花生产传统方式为一年一熟制。但近年来由于粮棉争地矛盾突出，棉花种植面积难以得到保证。为了摸索出该地区粮棉生产双丰收的新路子，全国种子总站、中国农科院棉花研究所、冀鲁豫等省种子站和有关市县组成联合开发组，在黄淮海地区进行短季棉新品种、配套技术开发研究。经过两年的试种，初步筛选出“中棉117”“中棉375”“中棉642”、“皖夏1号”等短季新品种，配以“宿育1号”等小麦品种，在保质保量收棉花的同时，每亩棉田可增收250公斤小麦。专家认为，采用配套品种和配套技术改革种植制度，提高复种指数，可以大大缓解该地区粮棉争地的矛盾。
    据专家计算，黄淮海地区的4800万亩棉田倘有70％的面积实行麦棉套种两熟制，可在保证棉花生产的同时，每年增收小麦84亿公斤，增加经济效益30多亿元。
