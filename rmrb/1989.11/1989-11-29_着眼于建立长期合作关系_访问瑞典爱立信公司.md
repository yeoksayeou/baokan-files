In the headquarters building of Ericsson Telecommunications Company in Sweden, the reporter interviewed the company's president, the general manager for the Asia-Pacific region, and the manager of the China department regarding the company's business development with China. They all emphasized in their respective conversations: We are developing a partnership with China based on the long-term interests of both sides.

President Åke Lundqvist said: "When we decided to develop business relations with China, we made it clear that we could not engage in one-off transactions, nor could we rush for quick results. We must focus on establishing long-term cooperation. China is a developing country, and its national conditions and economic system are different from those of Sweden. We are prepared for the difficulties we face and will not be shaken by some fluctuations in our confidence to develop cooperation with China."

Ericsson is one of the world's renowned telecommunications companies, with annual sales of 5 billion dollars. It is at the forefront of the world in technologies such as digital exchanges, cellular mobile telephone networks, and high-capacity transmission. Since 1981, the company has had active business cooperation with China.

The general manager for the Asia-Pacific region, Bill Ekman, introduced to the reporter that Ericsson's telecommunications engineering projects have expanded to 19 provinces and 78 cities in China. Among them, the AXE digital computer-controlled telephone exchange has been used in 52 cities including Beijing and Shanghai. By July of this year, China had ordered 107 sets of AXE exchanges with a total capacity of over 1 million lines, of which 260,000 lines have been put into use. China has become the company's main user of this type of exchange. China has also installed and ordered 80 Ericsson-produced MD110 dedicated voice and data communication systems with a capacity of over 100,000 lines. In addition, the company has become the largest supplier of cellular mobile telephone systems to China, with 70% of the mobile phones in use in China produced by the company.

Mr. Ekman said, "We regard the signing of sales contracts as just the beginning of establishing long-term cooperation, so we cannot focus only on providing equipment to China. In after-sales support services and technology transfer, we are also striving to be ahead of other companies. We have already signed several long-term cooperation agreements with the Chinese side. Technology transfer is playing an important role. We want the Chinese side to be able to operate, maintain, and develop digital exchanges and other equipment."

It is reported that Ericsson has helped China train more than 500 engineering and technical personnel and is preparing to establish training centers in Guangdong, Liaoning, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. The company has signed a technology transfer and production agreement with the Beijing Cable Communication Equipment Factory for the MD110 dedicated voice and data communication equipment. This 6-year agreement will enable the Beijing Cable Communication Equipment Factory to produce MD110 systems with a capacity of 100,000 lines per year. Recently, Ericsson signed a contract with the Chinese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to establish a software support center in Beijing. One of the tasks of this center is to provide comprehensive training for Chinese technical personnel in handling software programs.

Mr. Ekman expressed great confidence in continuing to develop cooperation with China. He said: "China is a country with 1.1 billion people. With the development of the economy, the demand for modern communications is more urgent. Ericsson can do a lot to meet the needs of China's telecommunications industry now and in the future."

He showed great concern for China's situation and believed that the current difficulties in China's economy are temporary. As long as the Chinese government insists on reform and opening up, China will definitely become rich and strong.

Mr. Ekman said: "In October this year, we opened our fourth office in China in Shanghai. Some cooperation projects with the Chinese side are being actively negotiated, which all indicate that our determination to develop cooperation with China has not changed. We have established a good cooperation foundation through years of efforts, and we should continue to move forward on this basis."

　　着眼于建立长期合作关系
　　——访问瑞典爱立信公司
　　本报记者　顾耀铭
    在瑞典爱立信电讯公司的总部大楼里，记者就该公司与中国的业务发展问题分别采访了公司总裁、亚太地区业务总经理和中国部经理。他们在各自的谈话中都强调：我们是从双方的长远利益出发发展同中国的合作伙伴关系。
    昂恩·斯维德堡总裁说：“当我们决定同中国发展业务关系时，就明确不能做一次性买卖，不能急于求成，要着眼于建立长期的合作。中国是一个发展中国家，国情和经济体制与瑞典不同。我们对面临的困难是有准备的，不会因为出现了一些波动，就动摇与中国发展合作的信心。”
    爱立信公司是世界著名的电讯公司之一，年销售额达50亿美元，在数字式交换机、蜂窝状移动电话网、高容量传输等技术方面居世界领先地位。自1981年以来，这个公司与中国的业务合作十分活跃。
    负责亚太地区业务的总经理亿乐向记者介绍，爱立信的电讯工程项目已扩及中国19个省78个城市。其中AXE数字计算机控制的电话交换机已在北京、上海等52个城市使用。到今年7月份中国已订购了107台总容量达100万门以上的AXE交换机，其中26万门交换机已投入使用。中国已成为该公司这种交换机的主要用户。中国还装用和订购了80部爱立信生产的MD110专用话音和数据通信系统，容量为10万门以上。此外，该公司已成为向中国提供蜂窝状移动电话系统的最大供应商，目前在中国使用的移动电话70％属该公司生产。
    亿乐先生谈到，“我们把签订销售合同只是看作建立长期合作关系的开始，因此不能把兴趣只放在向中国提供设备方面。在售后支援服务和技术转让方面，我们也在争取走在别的公司前面。我们已经同中国方面签署了几个长期合作的协议。技术转让正在担负起重要的角色。我们要使中国方面能够操作、维修和发展中国式的数字式交换机等设备。”
    据介绍，爱立信公司已帮助中国培训了500多名工程技术人员，并正筹备在广东、辽宁、江苏和浙江设立培训中心。该公司已与北京有线通信设备厂签订了MD110专用话音和数据通信设备的技术转让和生产协议。这个有效期为6年的协议将使北京有线通信设备厂每年能生产容量10万门的MD110系统。不久前，爱立信公司与中国邮电部签署了在北京建立软件支援中心的合同，这个中心的一项任务是对中国技术人员进行处理软件程序的全面培训。
    亿乐先生对爱立信公司继续发展同中国的合作表示很有信心。他说：“中国是一个11亿人口的大国，随着经济的发展对现代通信的需求更为迫切，爱立信公司在满足现在和将来中国电信事业发展的需要方面是可以有很多作为的。”
    他在谈话中对中国的局势十分关心，他认为中国经济目前出现的困难是暂时的，只要中国政府坚持改革开放，中国一定能富强起来。
    亿乐先生表示：“今年10月我们在上海开办了在中国的第四个办事处，同中方的一些合作项目正在积极谈判中，这都表明我们同中国发展合作的决心没有改变。我们双方经过了多年的努力建立了很好的合作基础，我们应当在这个基础上继续前进。”
