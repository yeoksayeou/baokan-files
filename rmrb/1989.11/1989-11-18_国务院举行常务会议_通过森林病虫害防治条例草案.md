Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 17th.

The State Council held its 50th executive meeting this morning, reviewing and approving the "Draft Regulations on Forest Pest and Disease Control."

The meeting was chaired by Acting Premier Yao Yilin.

The meeting noted that due to changes in ecological conditions and other reasons, forest pests and diseases in China have become increasingly severe. Since 1980, the annual area affected by forest pests and diseases nationwide has exceeded 100 million mu, and the trend is increasing year by year. Therefore, strengthening the prevention and control of pests and diseases has become an important issue that must be seriously addressed in the development of forestry. The "Forest Law" implemented in 1985 made principle provisions for the prevention and control of forest pests and diseases. To meet the needs of developing forestry and strengthening the prevention and control of forest pests and diseases, it is necessary to formulate an administrative regulation with legal force and more specific provisions for the prevention and control of forest pests and diseases.

These regulations will be issued and enforced by the State Council.

Eight members of the State Council Executive Meeting attended the meeting, and six were absent.

    国务院举行常务会议
    通过森林病虫害防治条例草案
    新华社北京11月17日电  国务院今天上午举行第50次常务会议，审议并通过了《森林病虫害防治条例（草案）》。
    会议由姚依林代总理主持。
    会议认为，由于生态条件变化等原因，我国森林病虫害日趋严重。1980年以来，全国每年发生森林病虫害面积都在1亿亩以上，而且呈逐年增加的趋势。因此，加强病虫害的预防和除治，已成为发展林业必须认真对待的重要问题。1985年施行的《森林法》，对森林病虫害的防治作了原则规定。为了适应发展林业的需要，加强对森林病虫害的防治工作，制定一部具有法律效力、又较为具体的森林病虫害防治行政法规，是十分必要的。
    这一条例将由国务院发布施行。
    国务院常务会议成员8人出席了会议，6人请假。
