In a residential room, a gas leak occurred. The homeowner returned from work and discovered the leak. He immediately picked up the room's telephone to call the relevant maintenance department. Unfortunately, as he lifted the handset, there was a loud explosion. The telephone exploded, followed by a fire in the room, with disastrous consequences.

Why can a telephone cause an explosion and fire?

Currently, most telephones in use in China are ordinary automatic telephones, with a voltage of 48-60 volts and a normal conversation current of about 30 milliamperes. When lifting or placing the handset, a high voltage is generated in the telephone's coil, and the telephone's contacts produce a spark. Normally, due to the telephone's casing, people do not see the spark. Flammable and explosive gases, such as coal gas, liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline vapor, acetylene, and hydrogen, disperse very quickly and can penetrate into the smallest spaces. If these gases enter the telephone and reach a combustible concentration, they will immediately explode and burn when they encounter the spark from the telephone.

What measures should be taken when flammable and explosive gases like coal gas leak into a room?

1. Ventilate the room. Before using gas, open the windows for a few minutes and then light the gas for safer use.
2. If a gas leak is detected, usually by a strong odor, immediately close the main valve to cut off the gas supply. Then open the doors and windows to quickly disperse the leaked gas. After the gas has mostly dissipated, use the room's telephone to report to the relevant departments and seek assistance.
3. For households and units with gas appliances, it is best to install a kitchen exhaust fan with a gas-sensitive head (electronic nose). When the leaked gas reaches a certain concentration, the exhaust fan will automatically remove the leaked gas. For units, factories, and workshops that use a large amount of flammable and explosive gases, if a telephone is needed, it should be a sealed, explosion-proof automatic telephone. The installation of ordinary automatic telephones should be prohibited.

### 煤气泄漏时切勿用本室电话机  原因：会发生爆炸

    煤气泄漏时切勿用本室电话机
    原因：会发生爆炸
    某住宅室内发生煤气泄漏，家庭主人下班回家发现后，立即拨本室电话找有关维修部门。不料，就在拿起电话机送受话器时，一声巨响，电话机爆炸了，随之室内起火，其后果可想而知。
    为什么电话机也能引起爆炸和燃烧呢？
    目前，我国普遍使用的是普通自动电话机，电流电压为48—60伏特，正常通话电流约为30毫安。从电话机话叉上拿起或放下送受话器的一瞬间，电话机内的线圈就产生高电压，电话机叉簧随之冒出电火花。平时，由于电话机外壳覆盖，人们看不到电火花现象。易燃易爆气体，像煤气、石油液化气、汽油挥发气、乙炔气、氢气等，扩散非常迅速而又无孔不入，如果钻进电话机内，且气体浓度已达到点燃条件时，遇到电话机中上述的电火花，就会立即发生爆炸和燃烧。
    那么，当室内煤气等易燃易爆气体泄漏时，应采取什么措施呢？
    一、房间要通风。使用煤气前，应先将气窗打开，过几分钟再点燃使用较为安全。
    二、遇有煤气等易燃易爆气体泄漏，一般能嗅到一种难闻的气味，应立即将总阀门关闭，断绝气源。然后将门窗打开，尽快使泄漏的气体流散。当泄漏气体基本散掉后，再使用本室电话向有关部门报告及找人来处理。
    三、有煤气等易燃易爆气体设备的家庭和单位，最好安装带有气敏感头（电子鼻）的厨房自动排抽烟机设备，当泄漏的煤气或气体达到一定浓度时，排抽烟电机即可自动将泄漏气体排出。有易燃易爆气体设备并大量使用的单位、工厂车间等场所，如需安装电话，应选择密封防爆型自动电话机，禁止安装普通自动电话机。
