People's Daily, Beijing, November 15th.

According to a seminar held today by the postal and telecommunications department, after half a year of deliberation and selection, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of China has decided to apply the "Five-Stroke Input Method" for computer Chinese character input, invented by the renowned computer expert Wang Yongmin, to the user telegraph system. This will gradually replace the outdated four-digit telegraph code.

Previously, China's telegraph system has been using the four-digit telegraph code designed by a Dane for the Qing government. This method, which has been in use for over 100 years, is difficult to learn and easy to forget, and no longer meets current requirements.

    电报系统将用五笔字型技术
    本报北京11月15日讯　据今天在此间召开的邮电部门专家座谈会透露，我国邮电部经过半年多的论证和优选，决定将著名中文电脑专家王永民发明的“五笔字型电脑汉字输入技术”应用于用户电报系统中，逐步取代落后的四位数字电报码。
    过去，我国的汉字电报一直沿用由丹麦人为清政府设计的四位数字电报码。这种沿用了100多年的方法难学易忘，已不合当前要求。
