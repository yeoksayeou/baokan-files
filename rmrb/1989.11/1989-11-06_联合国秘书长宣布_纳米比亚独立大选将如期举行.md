UN Secretary-General Announces Namibian Independence Election to Proceed as Scheduled

	NEW YORK, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced today that Namibia now has the conditions for holding free and fair elections, and the independence election will be held as scheduled from Nov. 7 to 11. This was stated in a report submitted by de Cuellar to the UN Security Council.

	De Cuellar called on all parties within and outside Namibia to strictly abide by the regulations of the Namibian independence plan and the code of conduct for political parties.

	De Cuellar warned that any form of intimidation and violence during the election process could jeopardize the resolution of the Namibian issue.

	De Cuellar said that over the past four weeks, the overall situation in Namibia has been calm. The election campaigns of 10 political parties have proceeded freely without encountering major obstacles, and the number of complaints from the public about intimidation has been decreasing.

	De Cuellar also pointed out that while the overall "security situation" in Namibia has improved significantly on the eve of the election, vigilance must be maintained against the possibility of deterioration in law and order.

    联合国秘书长宣布
    纳米比亚独立大选将如期举行
    本报联合国11月4日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天宣布：纳米比亚现在已具有举行自由、公正选举的条件，独立大选将于本月7日至11日如期举行。这是德奎利亚尔在向联合国安理会提交的一份报告中所说的。他号召纳米比亚内外各方严格遵守纳米比亚独立计划和各政党行为守则的规定。
    德奎利亚尔警告说，在选举过程中，任何形式的恐吓和暴力行为都可能使解决纳米比亚问题功败垂成。
    德奎利亚尔说，4周来，纳米比亚整个局势平静，10个政党的竞选活动自由地进展，未遇到重大阻碍，民众控告恐吓行为的案件持续下降。
    德奎利亚尔又指出，目前，在选举前夕，纳米比亚总的“安全形势”有了显著改善，但对法律和秩序可能恶化的情况仍需保持警惕。
