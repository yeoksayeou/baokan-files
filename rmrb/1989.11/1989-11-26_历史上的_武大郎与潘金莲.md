The Historical Figures of Wu Dalang and Pan Jinlian

When it comes to Wu Dalang, almost everyone knows about him. Whether in the novel "Water Margin" or on the stage, the image of a "three-inch-tall, skinny as a tree" figure is not glorious. However, in his hometown of Qinghe, Hebei, people seem to unanimously cite: "The real Wu Dalang was a tall, scholarly, and martial arts expert, with a deep reserve of talent, and an upright magistrate."

If that is the case, why did the two old masters, Shi Nai'an and "Smiling Scholar," distort the facts and harm others?

Sun Yansen, the secretary of the Qinghe County Committee of the Communist Party of China, introduced the outline of this historical injustice to the reporter.

Wu Dalang, whose real name was Wu Zhi, was from Wuji Village in Qinghe County. It is said that he was a scholar from a young age, excelling in both literary and martial arts, and thus achieved success at a young age by passing the imperial examination and becoming a magistrate in Yanggu, Shandong. He once helped a classmate who was struggling with poverty due to his unrecognized talents. This classmate traveled thousands of miles to seek Wu Dalang's help in obtaining an official position to escape his difficulties. Initially, he was warmly received, but after half a year, he did not hear anything about the official position, so he thought, "Wu Dalang is truly an ungrateful person," and in a fit of anger, left without saying goodbye. On his way home, he wrote many stories and jokes mocking Wu Dalang, pasting them in villages and shops along the way. Thus, vulgar words about Wu Dalang spread far and wide. However, when he returned home, Wu Dalang had already sent people with money to help him repair his house, buy good land, and build a new home. Only then did he realize that Wu Dalang was not ungrateful but rather did not engage in nepotism. He rushed back to tear down the papers he had posted, but it was too late. These things were like spilled water, impossible to retrieve. Coupled with some scholars and writers who took the opportunity to exaggerate, the false stories were passed down again and again.

Huangjin Village, located northeast of the county seat, is said to be the hometown of "Grandmother Pan," Pan Jinlian, according to Wu's descendants. According to Zhang Xingwen, who is in charge of reception in the village, Pan Jinlian was not the daughter of a tailor named Pan but the daughter of Pan Zhizhou, a high-ranking official in Bei Prefecture. She was a well-educated young lady, knowledgeable and virtuous, and lived a loving life with Wu Dalang until old age, bearing four sons. The elders say that Wu Song was also raised by her. The elder sister-in-law was like a mother, and the younger brother was like a son, so there was no such thing as killing the sister-in-law to avenge the brother!

Three miles south of Huangjin Village is Wuji Village. The village originally had a tomb of Wu Dalang. In 1946, when the tomb was excavated, a wooden coffin and two skeletons were found. According to three elderly people who participated in the excavation, Wu Dalang's skeleton was quite tall, estimated to be at least 1.78 meters tall in life. Moreover, if he were a seller of baked goods, how could he have a wooden coffin and a tomb built with many bricks!

During the investigation, the descendants of the Wu family also told many moving stories about Wu Dalang upholding justice, Pan Jinlian being loyal to love, assisting Wu Dalang in governing cleanly, and eliminating evil youths, restoring the original appearance of the two historical figures, Wu Dalang and Pan Jinlian.

### 历史上的　武大郎与潘金莲

专栏：

　　历史上的
　　武大郎与潘金莲
    提起武大郎，几乎妇孺皆知。无论在小说《水浒》中，或是在戏剧舞台上，“三寸丁谷树皮”的形象均不光辉。可在他的故乡河北清河，人们似乎有口皆碑地引证：“真正的武大郎是一位身材高大，文武双修、英华内蕴、为官清正的知县。”
    既然如此，那施耐庵和“笑笑生”二位老先生却为何颠倒笔墨、祸害于人呢？
    中共清河县委书记孙彦敏向记者介绍了这桩历史沉冤的梗概。
    大郎武植，系清河县武家那村人。据传，他自幼崇文尚武，才力超群，因而，少年得志中了进士，在山东阳谷做了知县。曾资助过武大郎的一位同窗好友因怀才不遇，家境日渐贫寒。于是，千里迢迢来投武大郎欲谋一官半职，摆脱困境。开始，他受到盛情款待，可过了半年也没听其提及做官之事，他便认为“武大郎真乃忘恩负义之辈”，一气之下，不辞而别。在回家路上，他编写了许多谩骂讽刺武大郎的小故事、歇后语，见村贴村，逢店贴店，于是乎，沿途传遍了有关武大郎的粗俗之词。谁知，待他回到家中，武大郎早已派人送来了银钱，帮他修房盖屋，置买良田。这时，他才发现武大郎决非知恩不报，而是不搞以权谋私。他发疯似地返回原路去撕自己贴的纸条。但是，悔之晚矣。这些东西就像泼出去的水，再也收不回来。加上一些文人墨客借题发挥，因而谬种一传再传。
    县城东北的黄金庄便是被武家后人称作“老祖奶奶”潘金莲的家乡。据乡里负责接待的张星文同志介绍，潘金莲并不是潘裁缝的女儿，而是贝州潘知州的千金小姐，一位大家闺秀。知书达理，和武大郎恩恩爱爱，白头到老，先后生下4个儿子。老一辈传下来说，武松也是她一手拉扯大的。老嫂比母，小叔是儿，哪来的杀嫂祭兄那宗子事儿！
    黄金庄正南三华里便是武家那。村上原有一座武大郎墓，1946年掘坟时发现，坟中有一口楠木悬棺和两具骨殖。据健在的三位参与挖坟的老人证实，武大郎骨殖相当高大，推算生前少说也有一米七八。再者，若是卖烧饼的，哪有楠木悬棺和许多青砖垒墓！
    记者在这里调查，武家后代们还讲说了许多武大郎匡挟正义，潘金莲忠于爱情，协助武大郎清廉治政，铲除恶少的动人故事，恢复了武大郎和潘金莲两个历史人物的本来面貌。
