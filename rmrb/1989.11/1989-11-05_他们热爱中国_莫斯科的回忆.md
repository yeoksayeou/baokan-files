Column: Blossoms of Friendship

I finally arrived in Moscow, not long ago. The solemn Red Square and Lenin's Mausoleum, the red star atop the Spasskaya Tower of the Kremlin, the fresh air, and the clean streets all left me with wonderful memories. However, what made an even deeper impression on me was the deep affection of the Soviet people for China and the Chinese people.

Friendship Between Peoples Endures
That was during the days of the Chinese Science and Technology Exhibition in Moscow. One morning, an elderly man with a head full of silver hair, accompanied by his grandchildren, came to the exhibition with great enthusiasm. He carefully examined each exhibit, his face beaming with smiles, and frequently told the Chinese colleagues by the display stands, "China has changed so much! The progress is amazing, truly remarkable!" This elderly man was named Vasili. In the 1950s, he had worked in China for four years as a Soviet expert. With deep emotion, he told us, "During my time working in China, I collaborated very well with Chinese engineers, technicians, and workers. The diligence, wisdom, and hardworking nature of the Chinese people left a deep impression on me, and I still remember it vividly." At this point, the old man pointed to a shining medal on his chest and said, "In 1960, just before we returned to our country, the respected Premier Zhou Enlai hosted a farewell banquet for us at the Great Hall of the People. It was he who personally pinned this Sino-Soviet Friendship Medal on me. More than 20 years have passed since I returned home, and I have always treasured it. This time, I came to visit the Chinese exhibition and specially wore it." Hearing the old man's account, we felt a surge of affection and respect for him. Although Sino-Soviet relations had experienced twists and turns in the past, during those difficult years, he often introduced China's ancient civilization and kind-hearted people to the younger generation. His deep affection for the Chinese people had never changed. When he learned that the Chinese Science and Technology Exhibition was being held in Moscow, despite his frail health, he enthusiastically brought his three generations of descendants to visit the exhibition. Seeing the rich and varied, dazzling array of Chinese scientific and technological exhibits, the old man was full of praise and reluctant to leave. He excitedly said, "After seeing the exhibition, I rediscovered China. After 10 years of reform and opening up, China has taken off! I congratulate you." After speaking, he took up the pen and wrote in the guestbook, "The friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union will endure! Let us learn from each other and make progress together." His little granddaughter also wrote in the guestbook, "I also like China."

Longing for Friendly Chinese People
In Moscow, the second Soviet friend I met was Lyudmila Machenko, a news reporter for Moscow Radio. She dressed simply and elegantly, and her bright eyes radiated warmth and friendship. Because we were colleagues, we started chatting like old friends as soon as we met. She spoke fluent but not entirely fluent Chinese, enthusiastically telling me about her wonderful time in China. Last year, she studied at Beijing Language Institute. The majestic Tiananmen Gate, the vast square, as well as the magnificent Forbidden City, Great Wall, and Temple of Heaven left her with beautiful memories. The simple and honest Chinese people, as well as her teachers and classmates with whom she interacted daily, made her unforgettable. Lyudmila excitedly said, "This spring, I returned to Moscow after completing my studies in Beijing, and to my surprise, I found myself crying in my room the very next day. My husband and children were all taken aback. I told them that I missed Beijing and the friendly Chinese people." Saying this, Lyudmila smiled through her tears...

During her stay in Beijing, Lyudmila also visited several places in China and witnessed the tremendous changes that had taken place since China implemented its reform and opening-up policy. She said that she saw a rich and varied array of Chinese products at the exhibition, as if she were back in China, strolling down Wangfujing Street. When we parted, Lyudmila held my hand and whispered, "China's mountains and rivers are very beautiful, and the Chinese people are very friendly. To be honest, China has become my second home..."

Serving Friendly Exchanges
Maxim, Artyom, and Alexei, students of the Eleventh Moscow Chinese School, are the youngest Soviet friends I met in Moscow. When I first met them, they said in not entirely fluent Mandarin, "Comrade from China, can we converse with you in Mandarin?" I was surprised and felt a sense of closeness, quickly replying, "Welcome, welcome!" They told me that their Chinese teacher was from Beijing and taught very seriously. Curiously, I asked, "Chinese is very difficult to learn, and Chinese characters are hard to write, so why do you want to learn Chinese?" They looked at each other and smiled at me. Artyom said, "We love great China, and we will learn Mandarin well to serve the exchanges between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China in the future." Maxim continued, "Our elders once worked in China and established deep friendships with the Chinese people. Our home still displays some Chinese handicrafts. Our ancestors often talked to us about China. The ancient civilization left a beautiful impression in our hearts. In recent years, Soviet newspapers and magazines have published more articles introducing China, which has increased our affection for China." Alexei said, "In recent years, my father and I often listen to the Chinese International Radio's Russian broadcasts. It is my window to China. China's long history, beautiful rivers and mountains, and achievements in reform... all attract me. I am determined to learn Chinese so that I can go to China in the future." These three young and energetic people each brought a Russian-Chinese dictionary, and whenever they encountered difficulties, they would look it up. On the day of our farewell, they firmly shook my hand and said, "We will always be friends!" Soon after returning to Beijing, I received a letter from them written in Chinese, filled with love for China—"I love great China, and we look forward to one day studying in Beijing and serving the peoples of China and the Soviet Union in the future."

    他们热爱中国
    ——莫斯科的回忆
    郭景哲
    我终于到了莫斯科，那是在不久之前。庄严肃穆的红场和列宁墓，克林姆林宫斯巴斯基塔上的红星，清新的空气，整洁的街道，都给我留下美好的回忆。然而，更使我难忘的是苏联人民对中国和中国人民的深情厚谊。
    人民友谊长存　那是中国科技展览会在莫斯科举行的日子，一天上午，一位满头银发的老人在儿孙陪同下，兴致勃勃地前来参观。他仔细观看每一件展品，脸上绽露笑容，不时对展台边的中国同志说：“中国变化太大啦！进步真快，了不起！”这位老人叫瓦西里，50年代曾作为苏联专家在中国工作4年。他满怀深情地对我们说：“在中国工作期间，我同中国工程技术人员和工人合作得非常好。中国人民勤劳智慧、吃苦耐劳的品质给我印象最深，至今记忆犹新。”说到这里，老人指着胸前一枚闪光的勋章说：“1960年，在我们回国前夕，尊敬的周恩来总理在人民大会堂设宴饯行，是他亲自为我戴上这枚中苏友好勋章。回国20多年了，我一直珍藏着它，这次来参观中国展览才特地把它戴上。”听了老人的叙述，我们对他顿生亲切敬佩之情。尽管中苏关系在过去年月出现过曲折，在那困难的岁月里，他也经常向下一代介绍中国古老的文明和善良的人民，他同中国人民的深厚感情始终没有改变。当他得知中国科技展览会在莫斯科举行的消息时，尽管体弱多病，也兴致勃勃地带领儿孙三代参观展览。看到丰富多采、琳琅满目的中国科技新展品，老人赞不绝口，流连忘返。他激动地说：“看了展览会，我重新发现了中国。经过10年的改革开放，中国腾飞了！我祝贺你们。”老人说完，提笔在留言簿上写道：“中苏两国人民友谊长存！互相学习共同进步。”他的小孙女也在留言簿上留下这句话：“我也喜欢中国。”
    想念友好的中国人民　在莫斯科，我结识的第二个苏联朋友，叫留德米拉·玛琴柯，是莫斯科电台的新闻记者。她衣着素雅、款式大方，一双水灵灵的大眼睛闪现着温暖的友情。因为是同行，我们一见面就像老朋友那样聊起来，她用不太流利的汉语滔滔不绝地向我讲述在中国度过的美好时光。去年，她到北京语言学院进修。雄伟的天安门、宽阔的广场，以及壮丽的故宫、长城、天坛等名胜古迹给她留下美的记忆，朴实憨厚的中国人民，朝夕相处的老师和同学更使她终身难忘。玛琴柯激动地说：“今年春天，我结束在北京的学习返回莫斯科，想不到第二天我竟在房间里哭起来了。一时间丈夫和孩子都楞了。我告诉他们，我想念北京，想念友好的中国人民。”说到这里，玛琴柯又破涕为笑了……
    玛琴柯在北京学习期间，还到我国一些地方参观访问，耳闻目睹了中国推行改革开放政策后发生的巨大变化。她说，她在展览会上见到丰富多采、令人眼花缭乱的中国产品，仿佛又回到中国，漫步王府井大街。告别时，玛琴柯握着我的手，悄声说：“中国的山水非常美，中国人民非常友好，说心里话，在我的心里中国已是第二故乡……”
    为友好交往服务　莫斯科第十一汉语中学学生马克西姆、阿尔乔姆和阿列克谢是我在莫斯科结识的最年轻的苏联朋友。我同他们初次见面时，他们用不很流畅的汉语说：“中国同志，我们用普通话与你交谈，好吗？”我感到惊讶，又感到亲切，忙说：“欢迎，欢迎！”他们告诉我，学校的中文教师是从北京来的，教得很认真……”我好奇地问：“中国的汉语很难学，方块字又难写，你们为什么要学习中国话呢？”他们你看我，我看你地朝我笑笑。阿尔乔姆说：“我们爱伟大的中国，我们学好汉语，将来可以为苏中两国人民之间的交往服务。”马克西姆接过来说：“我们的长辈曾在中国工作过，与中国人民建立了深厚的感情，家中至今陈设着一些中国工艺品。先辈们经常对我们谈到中国。文明古国在我们心里留下美好的印象。近年，苏联报刊杂志介绍中国情况的文章多起来了，更使我们增加了对中国的感情。”阿列克谢说：“这几年，我同父亲经常收听中国国际广播电台的俄语节目，它是我认识中国的窗口。中国悠久的历史、锦绣的河山、改革的成就……都吸引着我。我决心学中文，以便将来到中国去。”这三位朝气蓬勃的年青人每人带着一本俄汉字典，遇到困难就翻字典查找。告别那天，他们紧握我的手说：“我们永远是朋友！”回到北京不久，我收到他们用中文写来的信，字里行间充满着对中国的爱——“我爱伟大的中国，我们渴望有一天到北京深造，将来服务于中苏两国人民。”
