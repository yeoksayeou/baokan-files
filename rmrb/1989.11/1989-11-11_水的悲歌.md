The Lament of Water
Summary: Polluted water has made life and production unbearable for the surrounding population. The affected local governments should take immediate action to address the issue.

The Polluted Waters of the Qu River
A letter from Guan Cunliang of the Water Resources Bureau of Suixi County, Anhui Province: The Qu River, which originates in Shangqiu City, Henan Province, is an ancient natural waterway. Within our county, it flows through 5 districts, 3 towns, 20 townships, and 230 natural villages. In recent years, the river has been severely polluted due to the discharge of large amounts of industrial wastewater, endangering the drinking water of over 200,000 people along the riverbank. For the same reason, the 400,000 mu of irrigated farmland in the Qu River basin is decreasing by 40,000 mu each year.

Investigations have shown that the main sources of pollution in the Qu River are the industrial wastewater discharged by the Yucheng Paper Mill, Shangqiu First, Second, and Third Paper Mills, and the Leather Factory in Henan Province. Samples tested revealed that the industrial wastewater from the Yucheng Paper Mill exceeds the discharge standards in all indicators. Specifically, COD is 37 times the standard, and BOD6 is 21 times the standard. Our county government has repeatedly written letters and sent representatives to negotiate with the relevant parties to resolve the pollution issue, but to no avail. We appeal to the relevant provincial, municipal, and county leaders to take immediate action to address the pollution of the Qu River in accordance with the Water Law.

The Cry for Help from the Hong River
A letter from Xiong Deliang of the Communication Group of Baicheng Town, Xiping County, Henan Province: The Hong River, which flows through our county, was once the source of drinking water for humans and livestock and irrigation water for farmland in the southern regions of Yuyang, Xiping, and Shangcai counties. Today, the Hong River is severely polluted.

The primary cause of the Hong River's pollution is the industrial wastewater discharged by various enterprises and institutions upstream in Yuyang County, including the Paper Mill, Fertilizer Plant, Fiber Plant, Printing Plant, and Machinery Plant, as well as the Yuyang Industrial Zone. Since October 1987, the river water has turned a dark brown color, emitting a foul odor, and fish, ducks, and shrimp have died from poisoning and gradually disappeared. Humans and livestock cannot drink the water, and farmland cannot be irrigated. On June 14 of this year, leaders from the relevant departments of Luoyang City, Henan Province, conducted an on-site investigation in Xiping and Shangcai. The results showed that the levels of COD, BOD, ammonia nitrogen, volatile phenols, and other pollutants in the Hong River water were severely exceeding the standards, with the highest exceeding the standard by 255.4 times.

Over the past few years, although the relevant leading departments have made multiple contacts and negotiations, there has been no resolution, and the Hong River continues to cry for help!

The Plight of the Canglang Canal
A letter from Li Yanhui of the Tianjin Daily: In recent years, the pollution of the Canglang Canal in our city has become increasingly severe, causing great suffering to the seven villages along the canal in the Daguang District. The three most affected villages, Zhaizhuangzi, Douzhuangzi, and Zhangzhuangzi, have already seen 10,000 mu of farmland completely destroyed, and over 30,000 mu of farmland has seen a reduction in yield by more than 50%. According to statistics, the current economic losses in the agricultural and aquacultural sectors in the entire Daguang District amount to at least 20 million yuan per year.

The Canglang Canal originates from Cangzhou in Hebei Province. Since the 1960s, 24 fertilizer, chemical, pesticide, and paper mills have been built in the Cangzhou area. These factories now discharge 60,000 tons of industrial wastewater containing severely excessive levels of sulfur compounds, chlorine compounds, arsenic, mercury, and other harmful substances into the Canglang Canal every day, severely polluting the canal and the surrounding areas. The water quality of the Beipai River and the Ziya New River, which are adjacent to the Canglang Canal, has also been affected.

Additionally, the 9,200 mu of shrimp ponds distributed along the Canglang Canal in the Daguang District are similarly threatened by the industrial wastewater in the canal. For this matter, the relevant departments in the Daguang District have reported the situation to the Tianjin Municipal Government and the relevant national departments for many consecutive years and have contacted the relevant departments in Cangzhou, Hebei Province, to seek ways to address the pollution, but the issue remains unresolved.

The Disaster of Alkali Plant Wastewater
A letter from Tian Yu of Xingyi City, Guizhou Province: The 56 households in the Pingdong and Xinlian villages of the Pingdong Office in our city have 57 mu of high-quality rice fields that have been severely damaged by industrial wastewater since the Xingyi Alkali Plant began operations last October. Of these, 42.81 mu have been completely destroyed, and 14.7 mu have suffered losses ranging from 10% to 80%, resulting in an approximate loss of 30,000 kilograms of rice. The affected farmers strongly demand that the relevant departments take swift and fair action to order the Xingyi Alkali Plant to compensate for the villagers' losses.

The County Seat of Ying County is Choked with Foul Air
A letter from Xiao Yuanming of Ying County, Shanxi Province: There are over 30 alleys of various sizes in our county seat. The alleys are filled with sewage, and during the summer and autumn, maggots crawl everywhere, forcing passersby to cover their noses. Especially during rainy days, the alleys are flooded, making them muddy and almost impassable. Almost every household has to dig a large pit in front of their door to bail out the sewage with buckets and basins. During heavy rains and storms, residents are even more severely affected.

The broad masses of residents in the county seat of Ying County urgently appeal to the relevant department leaders to promptly address the issue of alley drainage and do some practical work for the people.

### 水的悲歌

专栏：呼吁

    水的悲歌
    提要：污水，使得周围群众的生活、生产苦不堪言，受害地的政府应尽快设法解决。
    浍河污水滚滚来
    安徽濉溪县水利局关存良来信：我县境内的浍河发源于河南商丘市，是历史悠久的天然河道，在我县境内的沿岸有5区、3镇、20个乡、230个自然村。近年来，因大量工业废水倾入浍河，使河水严重污染，以致沿岸20多万人民饮水受到威胁。由于同样原因，浍河流域的40万亩灌溉农田，以每年4万亩的速度逐年递减。
    据调查，浍河水的污染源是河南永城造纸厂及商丘第一、二、三造纸厂和皮革厂排放的工业废水。抽样化验表明，永城造纸厂排放的工业废水各项指标均超过工业废水排放标准。其中COD超标37倍，BOD6超标21倍。对此，我县人民政府多次致函或派人与有关方面协商解决污染问题，但一直未能如愿。呼吁有关省、市、县领导人尽快按水法治理浍河水的污染。
    洪河在呼救
    河南西平县柏城镇通讯组熊德良来信：流经我县的洪河，曾是豫南舞阳、西平、上蔡三县人畜饮用和农田灌溉用水之源。如今，洪河水正遭到严重污染。
    洪河污染的主要原因是上游的舞阳县造纸厂、化肥厂、纤维厂、印刷厂、机械厂等企事业单位和舞阳工业区大量排放工业废水。从1987年10月以来，河水被污染变为墨褐色，水质发臭、水鸭、鱼鹰和鱼虾中毒死亡，渐渐绝迹，人、畜不能饮用，农田不能灌溉。今年6月14日，河南省漯河市有关领导人一起深入到西平、上蔡进行了实地调查，结果监测洪河水中COD、BOD、氨、氮、挥发性酚等污染物都严重超标，最高超过标准255.4倍。
    几年来，虽经有关领导部门多次联系协商，但至今未有结果，洪河仍在呼救！
    沧浪渠的忧患
    天津日报社李艳辉来信：近年来，我市沧浪渠的污染情况日益加重，沿岸大港区七个村庄苦不堪言。受害最重的翟庄子、窦庄子和张庄子三个村已有1万亩农田绝收，减产50％以上的耕地已达3万多亩。据统计，目前全大港区在种植业和养殖业上的经济损失至少为每年2000万元。
    沧浪渠起自河北沧州。自60年代起，沧州地区陆续建起24个化肥、化工、农药、造纸厂。如今这些工厂每天向沧浪渠排放6万吨含有严重超标的硫化物、氯化物、砷、汞等有害成份的工业废水，严重污染了渠道及周围地区。与沧浪渠相邻的北排河和子牙新河的水质也已受到影响。
    此外，大港区分布在沧浪渠沿线的9200亩养虾池，同样经受着沧浪渠内工业污水的潜在威胁。为这件事，大港区有关方面已连续多年向天津市政府、国家有关部门报告情况，并同河北沧州市主管部门接洽，寻求治理污染的途径，但至今未获解决。
    碱厂污水之祸
    贵州兴义市田雨来信：我市坪东办事处坪东、新联二村56户人家的57亩多上等田头的杂交水稻，自去年10月兴义碱厂投产以来，遭到工业污水的严重侵害，有42.81亩颗粒无收，14.7亩损失10％—80％，损失稻谷约3万公斤。受灾农户强烈要求有关部门尽快秉公办事，责令兴义碱厂赔偿村民的损失。
  应县城臭气熏天
    山西应县晓元明来信：我县县城内共有30多条大小巷子。巷内污水成渠，夏、秋季节粪蛆到处爬，来往过路人捂着鼻子走。尤其是一到雨天，巷内积水成灾，泥泞不堪，几乎家家户户都要在街门前挖一个大坑，用桶、盆舀出污水。碰上大雨及暴雨，居民们更是深受其苦。
    应县城镇广大居民迫切要求有关部门领导尽快解决巷内排水问题，为人民办点实事。
