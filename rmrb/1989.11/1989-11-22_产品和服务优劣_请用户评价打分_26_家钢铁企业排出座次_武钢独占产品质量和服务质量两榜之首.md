Today, the China Quality Management Association User Committee announced the results of the user evaluation of product quality and service quality for 26 key steel enterprises nationwide. This year's evaluation, which lasted five months, primarily used mail surveys. After classifying and processing the user evaluation data with computers, the results for the overall evaluation of product quality and service quality are as follows:

In terms of product quality, the enterprises rated as very satisfied and satisfied by users include Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, Dalian Steel Plant, Panzhihua Iron and Steel Company, Daye Steel Plant, Capital Iron and Steel Company, and Fushun Steel Plant. Those rated as basically satisfied, dissatisfied, or very dissatisfied are, in order from highest to lowest score, Baotou Iron and Steel Company, Xining Steel Plant, Guiyang Steel Plant, and Tianjin Metallurgical Bureau.

In terms of service quality, the enterprises rated as very satisfied and satisfied by users are Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, Baoshan Iron and Steel Company, Chengdu Seamless Steel Pipe Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and Shanghai Metallurgical Bureau. Those rated as basically satisfied, dissatisfied, or very dissatisfied include Tangshan Iron and Steel Company, Guiyang Steel Plant, and Tianjin Metallurgical Bureau.

Through comprehensive analysis of a large amount of data, the China Quality Association User Committee believes that in terms of product quality, users' evaluations of the five items (including chemical composition, physical properties, surface quality, shape and size, and packaging) show that regardless of the type of product, most enterprises score low in packaging, reflecting users' dissatisfaction with the current packaging of steel products. Another issue is the poor surface quality of materials. Many steel plates and steel materials do not meet national standards for surface quality.

In the evaluation of the four items of service quality (including contract execution, warranty, technical service, and dispute resolution), dispute resolution scored the lowest. Some users, although they have opinions about the steel plants, do not dare to raise them publicly.

Additionally, the average score for contract execution is also relatively low.

　　产品和服务优劣　请用户评价打分
　　26家钢铁企业排出座次
　　武钢独占产品质量和服务质量两榜之首
    本报北京11月21日讯　记者刘国胜报道：今天，中国质量管理协会用户委员会公布了全国26家重点钢铁企业产品质量和服务质量用户评价结果。今年这次历时5个月的用户评价工作，以信函调查为主。经过对用户评价数据的分类计算机处理，产品质量总评价和服务质量总评价的结果如下：
    产品质量方面，各用户评价为很满意和满意的企业有武汉钢铁公司、重庆钢铁公司、大连钢厂、攀枝花钢铁公司、大冶钢厂、首都钢铁公司和抚顺钢厂；基本满意、不满意或很不满意的企业依次（由高分往低分排）有包头钢铁公司、西宁钢厂、贵阳钢厂、天津冶金局。
    服务质量方面，用户评价很满意和满意的企业为武汉钢铁公司、宝山钢铁公司、成都无缝钢管厂、鞍山钢铁公司和上海冶金局；基本满意、不满意或很不满意的企业有唐山钢铁公司、贵阳钢厂、天津冶金局。
    通过大量数据的综合分析，中国质协用户委员会认为，在产品质量方面，用户评价的5个分项（包括化学成份、物理性能、表面质量、形状尺寸、包装）中，无论哪类产品，在包装上大多数企业得分较低，反映出用户对当前钢铁产品的包装是不满意的。另一个问题是材质表面质量欠佳，许多钢板、钢材的表面质量不合国家标准。
    在服务质量的4个分项（包括合同执行、质保书、技术服务、异议处理）评价中，异议处理得分最低。有些用户虽然对钢厂有意见，但不敢公开提。
    此外，合同执行项平均得分也较低。
