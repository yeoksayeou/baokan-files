The Chinese and Japanese Go teams participating in the third and fourth rounds of the fifth China-Japan Go Ladder Tournament arrived in Hangzhou yesterday and today.

The Chinese team, led by team leader Hao Keqiang, national team head coach Nie Weiping, and deputy head coach Luo Jianwen, includes players Zhang Wendi (7th dan) and Yu Bin (8th dan).

The Japanese delegation is quite large, consisting of representatives from the Japanese Go Association, players, and representatives from NEC Japan Electric Company, Dentsu Company, and Asahi Shimbun, totaling 15 people. The team leader is Katagiri Yoshio, vice-president of the Japanese Go Association. The players are Yoneda Yuichi (9th dan) and Hane Yoshimasa (9th dan).

In the first two rounds, the Chinese and Japanese teams are tied at 1-1. On November 4, the third round will see Zhang Wendi (7th dan) from the Chinese team challenge Yoneda Yuichi (9th dan) from the Japanese team at the Zhejiang Guesthouse. If Zhang wins, he will face Hane Yoshimasa (9th dan) on November 6. If he loses, Yu Bin (8th dan) will take his place to challenge Yoneda.

The two Chinese players arrived in Hangzhou a day earlier than their Japanese counterparts and have been in a completely relaxed state these past two days. On the night of his arrival, Zhang Wendi attended a bridge tournament at the Hangzhou Minsheng Pharmaceutical Factory, his first time participating in such an event. This unprecedented move, occurring just before his first appearance in the China-Japan Go Ladder Tournament, suggests he is following the example of head coach Nie Weiping, who plays bridge before major competitions to relax his mind. Yu Bin also did not stay idle; today, he visited the Hangzhou Cigarette Factory with great interest.

    中日围棋代表团抵达杭州
    本报杭州11月2日电　参加第五届中日围棋擂台赛第三、四场比赛的中、日围棋代表团昨天和今天陆续抵达杭州。
    中方代表团由团长郝克强、国家队总教练聂卫平、副总教练罗建文率领，参赛棋手为张文东七段和俞斌八段。
    日本方面这次来杭的阵容较为庞大，包括日本棋院代表、参赛棋手及NEC日本电气公司、电通公司和朝日新闻社等单位代表共计15人。其中代表团团长由日本棋院副理事长片桐良雄出任。参赛棋手为苑田勇一九段和羽根泰正九段。
    本届擂台赛前两轮中日双方战成1∶1。11月4日第三轮比赛，由中方次先锋张文东七段在浙江宾馆出战日方次先锋苑田勇一九段，胜则6日接受日方羽根泰正九段挑战，负则由中方后继队员俞斌八段接战苑田勇一。
    先于日方棋手一天到达赛地杭州的中方两名参赛棋手这两天处于完全放松状态。张文东抵杭当天晚上即去参加在杭州民生药厂举行的桥牌比赛。这是他平生第一次参加桥牌比赛。这一破天荒的举动出现在他第一次出战中日围棋擂台赛之前，不能不使人感觉到他是在效法总教头聂卫平大赛之前打打桥牌，使自己精神上得到放松。俞斌也不甘寂寞，今天颇有兴致地参观了杭州卷烟厂。
