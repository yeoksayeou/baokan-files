    Participating in Macroeconomic Decision-Making and Providing Legal Services
    Over 1300 Counties and Above Have Hired Legal Advisors

    Reporter Jia Jianzhou reports from Jinan: "Local judicial departments should further improve the work of government legal advisors and provide better legal services for rectification and deepening reforms." This was stated by Cai Cheng, Minister of Justice, at a national conference on the experience of lawyers serving as government legal advisors held recently in Jinan.

    The practice of hiring lawyers as government legal advisors began in 1981. To date, over 1300 county, municipal, and district governments across the country have appointed legal advisors.

    It is reported that in provinces such as Shandong, Hebei, Jilin, Liaoning, and Hunan, over 80% of the counties, cities, and districts have hired legal advisors. Implementing this system has played a significant role in strengthening state governance, building socialist democracy and the rule of law, and promoting economic development. Taking the examples of Shandong, Hebei, Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Ningxia, from 1988 to June of this year, government legal advisors have submitted 4500 written consultations to various levels of provincial and regional leaders, reviewed, revised, and drafted 6100 regulatory documents, participated in 5900 important negotiations and reviews of major economic contracts organized by the government, mediated 7600 major disputes, provided legal consultations 4100 times, and through various business activities, helped the government recover and avoid economic losses amounting to 1.55 billion yuan. Government leaders generally praise legal advisors as reliable "good advisors" and "good assistants."

    To further improve the work of government-appointed legal advisors, the Ministry of Justice held a national conference on the experience of lawyers serving as government legal advisors in Jinan from November 21st to 25th. In his speech, Minister Cai Cheng proposed that in the next one or two years, while consolidating the work of the 1300 county, municipal, and district government legal advisors, new government legal advisors should be gradually developed in places with suitable conditions.

    Based on summarizing and exchanging work experiences, the conference also discussed and revised the "Regulations on Lawyers Serving as Government Legal Advisors" drafted by the Ministry of Justice.

    参与宏观决策　提供法律服务
　　千余县以上政府已聘法律顾问
    本报济南电　记者贾建舟报道：“各地司法部门要进一步做好政府法律顾问工作，为治理整顿和深化改革提供更好的法律服务。”这是司法部长蔡诚最近在济南召开的全国律师担任政府法律顾问经验交流会上讲话时提出的。
    聘请律师担任政府法律顾问工作开展于1981年。至今，全国已有1300多个县、市、区以上人民政府聘请了法律顾问。
    据悉，山东、河北、吉林、辽宁、湖南等5个省的省政府和这些省80％以上的县、市、区都聘请了法律顾问。实行这项制度，对加强国家政权建设、社会主义民主与法制建设以及经济建设，都起到了重要作用。以山东、河北、吉林、辽宁、江苏、湖南、江西、宁夏等8个省、区为例，从1988年至今年6月，政府法律顾问共向省、区各级领导提出书面咨询意见4500份，审查、修改、草拟规章性文件6100余件，参与政府组织的重要洽谈、审查重大经济合同等5900余件（次），参与调处重大疑难纠纷7600起，提供法律咨询4100余人次，同时还通过各项业务活动帮助政府挽回和避免经济损失达15.5亿元。政府领导人普遍称赞法律顾问是得力的“好参谋”和“好帮手”。
    为进一步做好政府聘请法律顾问的工作，司法部于21日至25日在济南召开了全国律师担任政府法律顾问经验交流会。蔡诚部长在讲话中提出，最近一两年内，要在巩固现有1300多个县、市、区政府法律顾问的同时，在有条件的地方逐步发展一批新的政府法律顾问。
    这次会议在总结交流工作经验的基础上，还讨论修改了司法部起草的《关于律师担任政府法律顾问工作的若干规定》。
