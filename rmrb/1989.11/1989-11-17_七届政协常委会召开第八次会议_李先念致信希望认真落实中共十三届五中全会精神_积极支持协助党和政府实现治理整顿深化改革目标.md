The eighth session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, with the main agenda of studying and implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, was held today in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

At the request of Li Xiannian, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Wang Renrong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee, presided over today's meeting of the Standing Committee.

A letter from Li Xiannian to the Standing Committee was read at the meeting. In his letter, Li Xiannian expressed his hope that the attendees would work together to make this meeting a success. He wrote that the important decisions made by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on economic issues and personnel adjustments are of great significance for stabilizing and developing China's political and economic situation. This plenary session was held at a crucial historical juncture in China's economic development. The "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Rectification and Deepening of Reform" adopted by the plenary session has made important decisions for achieving sustained, stable, and coordinated development of China's national economy. The implementation of these decisions will strongly promote China's socialist modernization and reform and opening-up. He sincerely hoped that this session of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference would seriously study the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session, raise awareness, unify thinking, and strengthen self-reliance and hard work. He also hoped that the results of the meeting would be brought to each person's work and to all the fronts and aspects they are connected with, striving for the full understanding and conscious support of the Communist Party of China's major decisions by people from all walks of life and the broad masses. He also sincerely hoped that all members and committee members of the National Committee, local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at all levels, and all specialized committees of the National Committee would conduct in-depth investigations, research, and political consultation, actively support and assist the work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and local party committees and governments at all levels to ensure the implementation of the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session and the achievement of the goals of rectification and deepening of reform.

Wang Renrong conveyed the main contents of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the attending members of the Standing Committee.

This session also distributed nine written reports seeking opinions to the attending members of the Standing Committee, including a report on the visit of the delegation of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to North Korea.
