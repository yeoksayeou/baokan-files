The fifth Women's Volleyball World Cup began today at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium in Tokyo. China, Cuba, the Soviet Union, and Japan each defeated their opponents. East Germany, Peru, South Korea, and Canada each lost one match.

China's team, consisting of Su Huijuan, Li Guojun, Xu Xin, Wu Dan, Li Yueming, and Lai Yawen, faced the East German team, which had an average height advantage. China's team combined heavy spikes and quick attacks, finishing the match in 59 minutes with a 3-0 victory. The set scores were 15-9, 15-1, and 15-5. In the post-match press conference, China's head coach Hu Jin expressed satisfaction with the young players' performance today, noting that defense and coordination still need improvement. Japanese reporters praised the performances of Li Yueming, Wu Dan, and Xu Xin.

Cuba's team easily defeated Peru, with set scores of 15-8, 15-2, and 15-8. Peru's key setter and two other main players were absent, affecting their team's strength.

The match between the Soviet Union and South Korea was unexpected. Although the Soviet Union ultimately won 3-0, the victory was hard-fought. The set scores were 15-12, 15-13, and 15-13. The Soviet Union's powerful attacks were often blocked by the shorter South Korean players. South Korea's quick attacks were also effective. The Soviet Union's frequent serving errors added to the difficulty and time required for their victory. In the post-match press conference, Soviet team captain Olga Chusovitina admitted that today's match was very tense, as they had never played against South Korea before and thus were not familiar with their style. The Soviet coach Karpoli also expressed dissatisfaction with today's result, stating that the Soviet team's initial matches in major tournaments are often disappointing, but they improve as the tournament progresses. Today's match did not reflect the Soviet team's true strength, partly due to the main setter's injured right thumb.

The only match that went beyond three sets was between Japan and Canada. Japan won 3-1, with set scores of 13-15, 15-6, 15-11, and 15-8. Japan's goal is to reach the top four. Apart from Cuba, the Soviet Union, and China, they aim to avoid losing to other teams. With strong support from Japanese fans, the Japanese team showcased their excellent defense and frequently blocked the opposing team's powerful spikes. The results of the first day's matches in the Women's Volleyball World Cup were as expected. Tomorrow's matches between China and Peru, and Cuba and the Soviet Union, will bring the competition to a new high.

    世界杯女排赛开赛　八支巾帼展开角逐
    中古苏日队战胜对手
    本报东京11月7日电　记者于青报道：第五届世界杯女排赛今天在东京代代木体育馆揭开战幕。中国、古巴、苏联、日本队分别战胜对手。东德、秘鲁、南朝鲜、加拿大队各负一盘。
    中国队今天首先出场的是苏惠娟、李国君、许新、巫丹、李月明、赖亚文。面对平均身高超过自己的民德队，以重扣和快攻相结合，59分钟内以3比零结束了比赛。三局的比分是15∶9、15∶1、15∶5。在赛后的记者会见中，中国女排主教练胡进对年青选手在今天比赛中的表现感到比较满意，认为防守和配合还有待加强。日本记者对李月明、巫丹和许新的表现表示赞赏。
    古巴队在今天的比赛中轻取秘鲁队，3局的比分是15∶8、15∶2、15∶8。秘鲁队的主力二传和另两名主力队员没有归队，实力受到影响。
    苏联队与南朝鲜队之间的比赛出人意料，虽然苏联最终以3∶0取胜，但赢得并不轻松。三局的比分是15∶12、15∶13、15∶13。苏联队的强攻多次被身材矮小的南朝鲜队员拦死。南朝鲜队的快攻也频频奏效。苏联队发球多次失误，也为自己取胜增加了难度和时间。在赛后同记者会见中，苏联队队长奥古连科承认今天比赛打得十分紧张，因为过去没有同南朝鲜队交过手，所以打得并不顺利。苏队教练卡尔鲍里也表示对今天的比赛结果表示不满意，并说苏联队每次大赛的初战都是不尽人意，但能越打越好。今天的比赛没有反映出苏联队的真实水平，其中也有主力二传左手拇指受伤的原因。
    今天唯一超过三局的比赛是在日本与加拿大队之间进行的。日本队以3∶1战胜加拿大队，四局的比分是13∶15、15∶6、15∶11、15∶8。日本队的目标是进入前四名。这样至少除古巴、苏联和中国队外，尽量不能输给其他队。在日本观众的强有力声援下，日本队再现了防守出色的特点，并多次封死对方高大队员的扣球。世界杯女排赛首日战的胜负结果，并没有出乎人们意料。明天中国对秘鲁、古巴对苏联的较量，将使比赛进入一个高潮。
