North Korea's Foreign Ministry Issues Statement on North Korea-U.S. Contact
Reiterates Proposal for Korean Peninsula Nuclear-Free Zone

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 9th - North Korea's Foreign Ministry issued a statement today, officially declaring North Korea's stance during the contact with the United States in Beijing on November 1st.

Song Ho-Gyong, Vice Minister of North Korea's Foreign Ministry, held a press conference at the Pyongyang People's Cultural Palace today. He said that the United States had reported on the contact between North Korea and the United States at the level of counselors in Beijing on November 1st in a manner favorable to itself, violating the initial agreement not to report specific details. Therefore, the North Korean side felt it necessary to publicly declare its stance during this contact.

Song Ho-Gyong read a statement from North Korea's Foreign Ministry, which said that the current international situation has shown signs of easing, and North Korea has consistently advocated for resolving tensions on the peninsula through dialogue and consultation. Therefore, it proposed the establishment of a nuclear-free zone on the Korean Peninsula.

The statement said that since the United States has deployed nuclear weapons in South Korea, a three-party talks involving North and South Korea and the United States should be held to discuss the withdrawal of these nuclear weapons. It is suggested that such talks be held this year in Geneva or another location agreed upon by both sides. If an agreement can be reached on the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons during the talks, North and South Korea will hold talks and issue a joint declaration confirming the nuclear-free zone. Additionally, the talks will discuss the issue of obtaining legal guarantees from nuclear-armed countries.

    朝鲜外交部就朝美接触发表声明
    重申朝鲜半岛无核区建议
    新华社平壤11月9日电  朝鲜外交部今天发表声明，正式申明朝鲜在11月1日同美国在北京接触时提出的主张。
  朝鲜外交部副部长宋浩景今天在平壤人民文化宫举行记者招待会时说，美国就11月1日朝美两国在北京进行的参赞级接触进行了有利于自己一方面的报道，违背了当初不报道具体内容的承诺。所以，朝鲜方面有必要公开自己在此次接触时提出的主张。
    宋浩景宣读的一份朝鲜外交部声明说，目前国际上出现了缓和的局面，朝鲜一贯主张用对话和协商的办法来消除半岛的紧张局势，因而提出了在朝鲜半岛建立无核区的建议。
    声明说，由于美国在南朝鲜部署着核武器，所以应该举行有朝鲜南北方和美国参加的三方会谈，讨论撤走这些核武器的问题。建议今年内在日内瓦或者其他双方商定的地方进行这种会谈。在会谈中，如能就撤走美国核武器问题达成协议，朝鲜南北方将举行会谈，并发表确定无核区的联合宣言，同时还要讨论要求具有核武器的国家给予法律保证的问题。
