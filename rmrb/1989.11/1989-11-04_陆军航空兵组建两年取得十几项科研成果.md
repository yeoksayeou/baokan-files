The Army Aviation Corps, established barely two years ago, has achieved nearly 20 scientific research results while simultaneously building, training, and tackling key issues, filling gaps in the field of military aviation science.

The Army Aviation Corps is a new type of specialized unit born out of military reforms. The communication and navigation systems for field helicopters developed by the research personnel of the Army Aviation system integrate communication, navigation, and command systems, allowing helicopters to fully utilize their technical and tactical capabilities and become a powerful tool for coordinated operations.

To enhance the endurance of aircraft, an internal auxiliary fuel tank was developed. After inspection, demonstration, and test flights, it was proven to have a reasonable structure, simple operation, convenient installation and removal, and reliable safety. It is suitable for China's vast territory, increasing flight time and range by more than 50%. Additionally, the active target for anti-tank missile shooting of armed helicopters, developed to support simulation training and live-fire exercises, and the testing equipment designed to ensure flight safety, have all received unanimous praise from experts both within and outside the military.

    陆军航空兵组建两年取得十几项科研成果
    本报北京11月3日讯  组建仅两年多的我军陆军航空兵部队，边组建，边训练，边攻关，取得了近20项科研成果，填补了我军陆航科研领域的空白。
    陆军航空兵是在军队改革中诞生的新型专业兵种。陆航系统的科研人员研制的野战机载通信导航车，集通信、导航、指挥系统为一体，使直升机最大限度地发挥技术战术性能，成为部队协同作战的有力工具。
    为提高飞机续航能力而研制的机内辅助油箱，经过考察论证和试飞，证明结构合理、操纵简单、拆装方便、安全可靠，适合我国幅员辽阔的特点，使续航时间和航程都增加了50％以上。此外，为配合模拟训练与实弹射击而研制的武装直升机反坦克导弹射击活动靶标，为有效地保障飞行安全精心设计而成的测试设备，都受到军内外专家一致好评。
