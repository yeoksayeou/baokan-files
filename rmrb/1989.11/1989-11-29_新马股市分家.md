The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange recently announced that all Malaysian-registered companies currently listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange must withdraw from the Singapore market and list on the Kuala Lumpur market by December 31 of this year.

This is a step towards realizing the Malaysian government's decision to completely separate its stock market from the Singapore Stock Exchange. On October 27, Malaysian Finance Minister Daim announced the decision to separate the stock markets. He said this decision is a "natural and logical development." The close ties between the Singapore and Malaysian stock markets have left the Malaysian market in a "vulnerable" position. After the separation, the Kuala Lumpur market will develop into a major stock market in the region.

Due to historical reasons, the Singapore and Malaysian stock markets have a mutual listing relationship. Currently, 182 Malaysian companies are listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange, while 53 Singapore companies are listed on the Kuala Lumpur Exchange. After the Malaysian companies withdraw from the Singapore market, the Singapore market will be affected. The total number of listed companies will decrease from the current 317 to 135, nearly halving, and the total market capitalization will decrease from 112 billion Singapore dollars to 62 billion Singapore dollars. Despite this, some market experts believe that while the separation may have short-term impacts, in the long run, it will stimulate the development of both markets.

Currently, both countries are actively preparing for the separation.

In Singapore, the withdrawal of Malaysian companies has been a topic of discussion in recent months, so the announcement of this decision did not cause a market panic.

On October 30, the Straits Times Industrial Index only dropped by 16 points, much less than the anticipated 40 points.

However, for the Singapore stock market, whether from a short-term or long-term perspective, it is necessary to take practical measures to further develop the market. To this end, the Singapore Stock Exchange has formulated an emergency plan to mitigate the impact of the separation.

At the same time, the Singapore market is actively encouraging domestic and foreign qualified companies to apply for listing to increase the number of listed companies.

Some brokerage firms and financial companies are seeking to establish branches in Kuala Lumpur or collaborate with Malaysian counterparts.

　　新马股市分家
　　李永明
    马来西亚首都吉隆坡股票市场委员会最近宣布，所有目前在新加坡股票市场挂牌的马来西亚注册的公司必须于今年12月31日前从新加坡股市撤回吉隆坡股市。
    这是为实现马来西亚政府决定将其股市彻底与新加坡股市分家的一个步骤。马来西亚财政部长达因在10月27日的周会上宣布了股市分家的决定。他说，这一决定是一项“自然的、合乎逻辑的发展”，新、马两家股市的密切联系使马来西亚股市处于“脆弱的”地位，分家后，吉隆坡股市将会发展成本地区的一个主要股票市场。
    由于历史的原因，新、马两国股市存在互相挂牌的关系。目前，有182家马来西亚公司在新加坡股市挂牌，而新加坡则有53家公司在吉隆坡股市挂牌。马来西亚公司从新加坡股市撤走后，新加坡股市的业务将受到影响。挂牌公司总数将从目前的317家减少到135家，减少一大半，股票总市值将从1120亿新元减少到620亿新元。尽管如此，一些股市专家认为，股市分家在短期内可能造成影响，但从长远观点看，分家之后将能刺激两地股市更迅速地发展。
    目前，两国股市都在为分家做积极准备。
    在新加坡方面，马来西亚公司撤回已是此间近几个月来人们谈论的话题之一，所以，这一决定的宣布并未引起股市的狂抛。
    在10月30日的股市交易中，《海峡时报》工业指数只下降了16个百分点，比预计的40个百分点要少。
    但是，对新加坡股市来说，无论从长期或短期观点来看，都必须采取切实措施来进一步发展其股市。为此，新加坡股票交易所已经制定了一套应急计划，以减少由于分家而造成的冲击。
    与此同时，新加坡股市也大力鼓励国内外合格的公司申请挂牌，以扩大股市的挂牌公司数目。
    一些股票经纪行和金融公司都争取到吉隆坡设立分支机构，或寻求同马来西亚同行联手合作。
