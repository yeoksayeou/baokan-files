Facing the autumn winds of the northern frontier, reporters came to the Huangyangtan range under the Yan Mountains in a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region.

Here, hundreds of tents are neatly arranged, hundreds of cannons are lined up in a row, and thousands of officers and soldiers are vigorously training. What a busy scene of military training!

The unit, in order to implement the guiding principle of the Military Commission, which is to "focus on military training and use combat effectiveness as the standard," has strengthened military training. In one month, they completed three months of basic training courses, and their test scores reached good or above.

In late September, the Beijing Military Region held an on-site meeting in this unit.

In early October, the General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army Artillery Corps sent their training experience to all artillery units across the army.

    练兵忙
    ——北京军区炮兵某部训练剪影
    迎着塞外的秋风，记者来到燕山角下的北京军区某部黄洋滩靶场。
    这里，几百顶帐篷整整齐齐，数百门火炮一字排开，几千名官兵龙腾虎跃，好一派繁忙的练兵景象。
    这个部队为贯彻军委确定的“以军事训练为中心，以战斗力为标准”的指导方针，加强军事训练，一个月完成了三个月的基础训练科目，考试成绩达到良好以上。
    9月底，北京军区在这个部队召开了现场会。
    10月上旬，中国人民解放军总参谋部炮兵部向全军炮兵部队转发了他们的训练经验。

      （3）对新战士进行严格专业基础训练。
      （4）训练间隙干部、战士进行娱乐活动。
      （5）通讯兵进行跨越障碍训练。
      （6）将军陈明义（中）每天早上打起背包和战士一起进行训练。
