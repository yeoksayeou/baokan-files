China has achieved internationally recognized success in sediment research, with nearly 500,000 square kilometers of soil erosion areas already treated, accounting for one-third of the total soil erosion area in the country.

China is a country with a large population but relatively limited arable land, and soil erosion is severe. The Yellow River alone carries an average of 1.64 billion tons of sediment annually, with a total soil erosion area of 1.5 million square kilometers nationwide. The Party and the government attach great importance to soil conservation, and significant achievements have been made in this area in recent years.

Recently, the Fourth International Symposium on River Sedimentation was held in Beijing. Chinese experts and scholars presented over 100 academic papers. These included methods for flushing and dredging the nearly silted-up Sanmenxia Reservoir, bringing it back to life; advanced sediment model experiments that reached international standards, which solved the sediment problems in the navigation channel of the Gezhouba Hydropower Project; and a summary of comprehensive treatments for over 7,000 small watersheds since 1982, which has achieved good social and economic benefits. These achievements have been highly praised by experts and scholars from 29 countries and regions, including the United States, West Germany, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom.

    我国泥沙研究成果可观
    赢得各国专家高度评价
    本报讯　我国在泥沙研究方面取得举世公认的成就，近50万平方公里的水土流失面积已经得到治理，占全国水土流失总面积的1／3。
    我国是一个人口众多而耕地相对较少的国家，水土流失严重。仅黄河挟带泥沙平均每年高达16.4亿吨，全国水土流失面积为150万平方公里。党和政府对水土保持十分重视，近年来，这项工作取得很大的成就。
    近日在京召开的第四次河流泥沙国际学术讨论会上，我国专家、学者提供了100多份学术论文，其中有使几乎淤废的三门峡水库起死回生的水库淤积调水调沙方法；有达到国际先进水平的泥沙模型试验，葛洲坝水利枢纽引航道的泥沙问题就是借助于这项试验而获解决的；有1982年以来综合治理7000多条小流域的理论总结，它所概括出来的模式已取得较好的社会经济效益。这些成果受到来自美国、联邦德国、日本、法国、英国等29个国家和地区的专家、学者的高度评价。
