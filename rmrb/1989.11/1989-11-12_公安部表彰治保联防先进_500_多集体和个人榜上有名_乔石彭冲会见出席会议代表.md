The first national conference on the exchange of experiences in the work of urban and rural community security committees and neighborhood watch teams was held today in Beijing. A total of 106 outstanding organizations and 409 individuals were commended by the Public Security Ministry.

Before the conference, Qiao Shi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, and Peng Chong, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, met with the representatives attending the conference.

Wang Fang, State Councilor and Minister of Public Security, addressed the meeting. He said that over the past 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, the urban and rural community security committees, initiated by Comrade Mao Zedong in 1951, have developed into a massive force with over 800,000 grassroots organizations and more than 9 million members, becoming the mainstay of China's community-based governance. Urban and rural community security committees and neighborhood watch teams, deeply rooted among the people, have played a significant role in mobilizing and organizing the masses to safeguard the socialist revolution and construction, maintain social stability, prevent and combat criminal activities, mediate civil disputes, educate and rehabilitate wayward youth, and help the people solve difficulties, as well as promote the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.

Wang Fang pointed out that the plots of domestic and foreign hostile forces to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and subvert the socialist system have not ceased. There are still many destabilizing factors in society, and the public security situation in some places remains very severe. Community-based security and neighborhood watch work must be strengthened, not weakened.

Wang Fang hoped that the broad masses of community security activists would not disappoint the expectations of the Party and the government, would not be satisfied with the achievements already made, and would do their work even better.

    公安部表彰治保联防先进
    500多集体和个人榜上有名
    乔石彭冲会见出席会议代表
    本报北京11月11日讯　全国首次城乡治保会、治安联防队工作经验交流会今天在这里召开。106个优秀集体与409个先进个人受到公安部的表彰。
    会前，中共中央政治局常委、中央政法领导小组组长乔石、全国人大常委会副委员长彭冲接见了与会代表。
    国务委员兼公安部部长王芳在会上讲话。他说，建国40年来，毛泽东同志1951年倡导的城乡治保会已发展建设成拥有80多万个基层组织、900多万人的宏大队伍，成为我国群治工作的主体。城乡治保会和治安联防队等群防群治组织深深地扎根于人民群众中间，在动员和组织广大群众保卫社会主义革命和建设，维护稳定的社会秩序、预防、打击违法犯罪，调解处理民事纠纷，教育挽救失足青少年，以及为群众排忧解难和促进社会主义精神文明建设方面，发挥了巨大作用，做出了重要贡献。
    王芳指出，当前国内外敌对势力妄图推翻共产党的领导、颠覆社会主义制度的阴谋活动并没停止，社会上各种不安定因素还很多，一些地方的治安形势仍然十分严峻，群众性治保、联防工作只能加强不能削弱。
    王芳希望广大治保积极分子，不辜负党和政府的希望，不满足已有的成绩，把工作做得更好。
