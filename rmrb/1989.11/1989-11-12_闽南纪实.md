Fully utilizing overseas Chinese capital and manpower, establishing and developing export-oriented enterprises, earning a large amount of foreign exchange for the country, and supporting socialist construction are the goals pursued by some farmer entrepreneurs in Fujian Province's Minnan region. These enterprises develop production without competing with domestic enterprises for raw materials or markets; instead, they import raw materials from abroad and sell their products overseas. Today, this export-oriented economy is rapidly expanding in the Minnan region. At the same time, it has cultivated a group of excellent enterprise managers. Here, we publish a few snapshots of the work of these farmer entrepreneurs.

The Shishi Breastwear and Garment Factory in Fujian is a group of export-oriented enterprises. The "Aihua" brand high-grade breastwear and garments produced by the factory have won the appreciation of customers with their quality and credibility. The picture shows the factory manager, Song Taiping, researching new garment styles with the workers.

The Shishi Huatian Knitting Factory in Fujian is an enterprise established by farmers. The various knitted fabrics they produce are popular with consumers both domestically and internationally.

The manager of the Xinyajian Handbag Company in Fujian, Guan Xiaomei, regards product quality as the lifeblood of the enterprise. Since the factory was established, all products have been exported, and there have been no disputes with foreign businesses due to quality issues. This is him inspecting production in the workshop.
