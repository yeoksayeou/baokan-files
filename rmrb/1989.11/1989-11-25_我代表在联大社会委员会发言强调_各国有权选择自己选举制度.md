Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, November 14th.

China's representative, Gao Yanping, speaking at the 44th session of the United Nations General Assembly's Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee on November 14th, pointed out that a country's choice of an electoral system that suits its own national conditions, based on its constitution and electoral laws, is entirely an internal affair. No other country has the right to criticize or interfere.

Gao Yanping stated that no one has the right to impose their own electoral system as a model on other countries. Any such attempt would violate the basic principles of international relations and would not succeed.

She said that the electoral system is an important part of a sovereign state's political and legal systems. According to the United Nations Charter and international law principles, every country has the right to freely choose and develop its own political, social, economic, and cultural systems, including its electoral system. At the same time, each country should ensure that its electoral system reflects the will of its people, truly guaranteeing the people's full right to participate in and manage state affairs. Gao Yanping pointed out that countries, based on the wishes of their own people and national conditions, have chosen different electoral systems, including different methods and procedures for elections.

　　我代表在联大社会委员会发言强调
　　各国有权选择自己选举制度
    新华社联合国电　中国代表高燕平11月14日在第44届联大社会、人道和文化委员会发言时指出，一个国家根据其宪法和选举法选择符合自己国情的选举制度，完全属于该国自己的内部事务，任何外国无权进行挑剔和指责。
    高燕平说，任何人无理由将自己的选举制度作为模式去强加给其他国家。任何这样的企图都是违背国际关系基本准则的，也是行不通的。
    她说，选举制度是主权国家的政治制度和法律制度的一个重要的组成部分。根据联合国宪章和国际法准则，各国有权利自由选择和发展其政治、社会、经济和文化制度，包括选举制度。同时，各国也应确保其选举制度能体现其人民的意志，以真正保证人民充分实现参与和管理国家事务的权利。高燕平指出，各国根据自己人民的意愿和国情，选择了不同的选举制度，包括不同的选举方式和选举程序。
