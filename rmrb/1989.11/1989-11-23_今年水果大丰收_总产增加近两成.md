This year, China's fruit production continued to maintain a steady increase. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, this year's national fruit tree area is expected to be about 12% larger than last year, reaching 85 million mu, with a total production of approximately 199 million tons, an increase of 19% over last year.

The reporter learned from the recent National Fruit Tree Production Conference held in Yantai that this year's national citrus production can be increased by 70% compared to last year. Although the total production of apples, pears, and grapes in some northern regions suffered from severe drought, it still increased by 10-20% compared to last year. Other fruits, except for bananas and pineapples which saw a decrease in production, all had varying degrees of increase. Over the past decade, as China's population continues to grow, the per capita fruit consumption has increased several times, from 6.8 kilograms in 1978 to the current 15 kilograms, thus achieving the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" ahead of schedule.

　　今年水果大丰收
　　总产增加近两成
    据新华社烟台十一月二十二日电　（记者蒲立业）今年我国水果生产继续保持稳定增产的势头。据农业部预计，今年全国果树面积约比去年扩大百分之十二，达八千五百万亩，总产量可达一千九百九十万吨左右，比去年增长百分之十九。
    记者从近日在烟台结束的全国果树生产座谈会上了解到，今年全国柑桔可比上年增产七成。苹果、梨和葡萄的总产，虽然北方部分地区遭受严重干旱，仍比去年增产一至二成，其他水果除香蕉、菠萝比去年减产外，都有不同程度的增产。近十年来，在我国人口日益增长的情况下，人均占有水果量成倍提高，由一九七八年的六点八公斤上升到现在的十五公斤，提前实现“七五”发展规划。
