Over the past few days, the Liuzhou Railway Division has been working hard to transport oranges despite a severe shortage of railcars. From September 5 to November 2, the entire division transported 53,000 tons of oranges, completing 158.5% of the planned orange export volume and increasing the transport volume by 42.9% compared to the same period last year.

This year, the regions along the northern line of the Xiang-Gui Railway, including Guilin and Quanzhou, have had a bumper harvest of oranges. The oranges are ready for market early and need to be transported quickly and in large quantities, with the farthest destinations being the Soviet Union.

    柳铁分局赶运柑桔
    据新华社南宁11月3日电　（通讯员华树芬、韦建文）连日来，柳州铁路分局在车皮严重不足的情况下，挖潜抢运柑桔。从9月5日至11月2日，全分局共装运柑桔5.3万吨，完成柑桔外运计划的158.5％，比去年同期增加运量42.9％。
    今年地处湘桂铁路北线的桂林、全州等地区柑桔丰收。柑桔上市早，急需外运多，最远的要运到苏联。
