East Germany's Central Committee Politburo member Günter Schabowski announced yesterday evening at a press conference that East German citizens can travel abroad and make multiple trips across the border without needing to state special reasons. This step means that East Germany has effectively opened the borders between East and West Germany and between East and West Berlin. This is the first time in the 40-year history of East Germany.

West German political circles welcomed this decision by East Germany. The leader of the Free Democratic Party parliamentary group stated that complete freedom of travel between the two Germanys should be realized. U.S. Secretary of State James Baker called it "a very positive change."

According to reports, the West German Interior Ministry has instructed relevant departments to prepare for the possible arrival of a large number of East German citizens. The Interior Ministry stated that any East German citizen coming to West Germany will be accepted and will not be deported. However, West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble had previously urged East German citizens to "seriously consider" the issue of moving to the West, as their living conditions in West Germany may be much worse for a considerable period of time. The editorial in the West German "General-Anzeiger" stated that the entire Federal Republic of Germany and every citizen are affected by this wave of migration. It is undeniable that East German citizens moving to the West have become lethal competitors for jobs and housing in West Germany. Although West Germany is one of the richest industrialized countries in the West, it now faces the greatest internal challenge in its history.

According to reports, East German famous female writer Christa Wolf appealed on television for East German citizens to stay in their hometowns and participate in the reform process.

According to another report, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said that the Soviet Union welcomes the changes in East Germany.

    民主德国宣布开放边界
    民德一著名女作家呼吁公民留在家乡参与改革
    西德内政部长指出民德公民慎重考虑移居问题
    本报柏林、波恩11月10日电　记者许宏治、江建国报道：德国统一社会党中央政治局委员亨特·沙博夫斯基昨晚在记者招待会上宣布，民主德国公民从即日起可以经由民主德国边界出国旅行和多次往返，不必申述特殊理由。这一步骤意味着民主德国实际上开放了两个德国和东西柏林之间的边界。在民德40年历史上，这是第一次。
    西德政界对民德这项决定表示欢迎。自民党议会党团负责人表示，两个德国之间完全自由的旅行往来应该予以实现。美国国务卿贝克称“这是一个非常积极的变化”。
    据报道，西德内政部已经指示各有关部门作好准备，迎接可能大批到来的民德公民。内政部说，任何前来西德的民德公民都予以接纳，不会被遣返。但是，西德内政部长朔伊布勒已于日前呼吁民德公民
  “认真考虑”移居西方问题，因为他们在相当长的一段时间内在西德的居住条件可能比他们现在的条件还要差得多。西德《总汇报》的社论说，目前整个联邦德国和每个公民都受这股移居浪潮的影响。不容忽视的是，移居西方的民德公民已经成为西德劳动岗位和寻找住宅者的致命竞争者。尽管西德是最富裕的西方工业国之一，但是现在必须迎接历史上最大的一次内政上的挑战。
    据报道，民主德国著名女作家克里斯塔·沃尔夫在电视上呼吁民德公民留在家乡，参与改革进程。
    另据报道，苏联外交部发言人格拉西莫夫发表谈话说，苏联欢迎民德出现的变化。
