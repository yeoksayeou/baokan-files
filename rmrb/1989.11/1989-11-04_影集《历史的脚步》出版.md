Author: Yan Shiguì

Edition: 4

The photo album "Footsteps of History" by veteran photographer Gao Liang has recently been published by Liaoning Fine Arts Publishing House. This collection compiles works shot by the author over more than 40 years of photographic reporting, capturing moments of historical significance. Some vividly record the touching scenes of our country's elder revolutionary leaders engaged in various activities; others vividly recreate the intense battle scenes from the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the Korean War; and there are also moments that reflect the unity between the military and the people, the rebuilding of homes, the birth of New China, and the raising of the first five-star red flag over Tiananmen Square, all of which are heart-stirring moments...

A symposium was held today at the Lao She Tea House to celebrate the publication of this collection. Attendees included veteran generals Yang Chengwu, Shi Jinqian, Yuan Shengping, and Kuang Fuzao, writer Wei Wei, and media and photography industry figures Qin Chuan, Li Zhuang, An Gang, Luo Guangda, and Shi Shaohua. Also present were People's Daily Deputy Editor-in-Chief Zhang Yunsheng, Liaoning Fine Arts Publishing House President Zhao Min, and Beijing Dabowu Tea Trade Group General Manager Yin Shengxi, who all came to offer their congratulations.
