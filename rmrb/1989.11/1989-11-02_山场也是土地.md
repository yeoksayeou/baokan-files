Mountains are also land. "Land" means "fields," and mountains are not considered "land." Some dictionaries explain it this way. This is a rather common and one-sided understanding. Does this mean that only arable land counts as "land"? Today, we are publishing two articles written by county committee secretaries, and we hope to further the discussion.

China is a mountainous country. Mountainous areas account for nearly 70% of the national territory. "Seven-tenths mountains, two-tenths water, one-tenth arable land" is a summary of the distribution of mountains, forests, water, and arable land in our country. If we discuss the importance of cherishing every inch of land but focus only on the "one-tenth arable land," then there is really very little we can do. Cherishing every acre of mountain, managing mountains like we manage fields, the prospects are extremely broad.

### 山场也是土地

    山场也是土地
    土地即“田地”，山场不算“地”，有的辞典也这样解释。这是一种相当普遍的片面认识。难道真的只有耕地才算“地”？今天发表了两篇县委书记写的文章，我们希望进一步开展讨论。
    我国是一个多山的国家。山区约占国土面积的近70％。“七山二水一分田”，就是人们对我国山林、水域和耕地分布状况的概括。我们讨论珍惜每寸土地，如果只在“一分田”上做文章，那可做的文章实在太少。珍惜每亩山，像经营田地那样经营山，前景是极其广阔的。
