On the evening of April 12, 1919, 13 Bolsheviks and 2 workers at the Solkovo Garage in Moscow, after finishing their shifts, worked for an additional 10 hours without compensation to repair three damaged locomotives. They casually referred to this action as "Subbotnik" (Saturday Voluntary Labor). Unexpectedly, this new term spread throughout the young Soviet state. People began to approach their labor with a new, communist attitude, linking their previous means of survival with a great pursuit and belief. Lenin fully endorsed and highly praised the "Saturday Voluntary Labor," calling it the "sprout of communism."

In the 1950s and 1960s, "Saturday Voluntary Labor" also became popular in our country. In recent years, it seems to have become outdated. Today, revisiting it makes one feel familiar and inspired. It is not only an important means of educating the people in communist traditions but also a revelation of the relationship between reform and socialism, reminding people that the direction of reform is always socialism and communism.

From its inception to becoming a great endeavor of this century, it was all based on voluntary participation. Voluntary labor initiated by administrative orders is not only short-lived but also loses its original meaning. Some units treat "Saturday Voluntary Labor" as a synonym for office sanitation, which is a desecration of this "great initiative." The harm is that voluntary labor, which originally aimed to strengthen people's beliefs, instead produces the effect of undermining those beliefs. Therefore, "Saturday Voluntary Labor" must avoid formalism and prevent vulgarization.

    重提“星期六义务劳动”
    1919年4月12日晚，莫斯科索尔基洛夫车库的13名布尔什维克和2名工人，下班后不计报酬继续苦干10小时，修好了三台损坏的机车。对这次行动，他们随口叫作“苏鲍特尼克”（即星期六义务劳动）。想不到，这个新鲜的名词后来传遍整个年轻的苏维埃国家。人们纷纷以一种新的、共产主义的态度对待自己的劳动，把过去仅仅用来谋求生存的手段与一种伟大的追求和信仰联系在一起。对“星期六义务劳动”，列宁给予了充分肯定和高度赞扬，称其为“共产主义的萌芽”。
    在五六十年代，“星期六义务劳动”在我国也风靡一时。近些年来，它似乎显得不合时宜。今天重提它，让人感到亲切、振奋。它不仅是对人民进行共产主义传统教育的重要手段，还给人们以改革与社会主义关系的昭示，使人们不忘记改革的方向永远是社会主义和共产主义。
    它从发起到成为本世纪的伟大壮举，都是建立在自觉自愿的基础上的。靠行政命令开展起来的“义务劳动”，不仅是短命的，也失却了它本来的意义。有的单位把“星期六义务劳动”当成了机关卫生扫除的代名词，是对这个“伟大的创举”的亵渎。其危害是，本来以强化人们的信念为目的的“义务劳动”，却异化出破坏人们信念的效果。所以，“星期六义务劳动”，要防止形式主义，避免庸俗化。
