Japan's Defense Agency decided on the 10th that it will send Self-Defense Forces to overseas U.S. military training grounds for military exercises in the future.

These exercises, which are difficult to conduct in Japan, include live-fire exercises for long-range artillery and SSM-1 surface-to-ship missiles. This content will be included in the new defense force expansion plan starting from the 1991 fiscal year.

The Jiji Press noted that if this measure is implemented, sending Japanese Self-Defense Forces to the United States for training will become a regular action.

So far, the Japanese Defense Agency has conducted one surface-to-air missile firing exercise each year at a shooting range in New Mexico, USA.

    日本派自卫队去美军演习场演习
    据时事社报道，日本防卫厅十日决定，今后将派自卫队到海外美军演习场进行军事演习。
    这些在日本难以进行的演习包括长射程炮和SSM1地对舰导弹的实弹演习。上述内容将写进自一九九一年度开始的新的防卫力量扩充计划中。
    时事社指出，如果这一措施得以实现，日本派自卫队到美国训练将成为经常化行动。
    迄今，日本防卫厅每年在美国新墨西哥州的一射击场进行一次地对空导弹射击演习。（据新华社）
