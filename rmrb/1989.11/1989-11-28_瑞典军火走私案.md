In recent years, several Swedish arms companies have been exposed for engaging in illegal activities such as smuggling and bribery, causing a strong reaction in Swedish society.

The arms industry is one of Sweden's traditional industries, with 28,000 people currently employed in the sector. The annual revenue of eight arms companies amounts to 18 billion Swedish kronor (approximately $2.8 billion).

Sweden is located between the two major military blocs, NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Successive governments have advocated for a certain level of defense capabilities to support Sweden's policy of peaceful neutrality. Therefore, Sweden should have an "independent and diversified" arms industry. Currently, 70% of the equipment used by the Swedish military is domestically produced, with a small amount of arms exported each year. However, according to parliamentary legislation, arms exports must be approved by the government and are strictly regulated. Arms are not allowed to be exported to warring countries or regions with tense situations, especially those where superpowers are involved.

However, despite the strict legislation, there are still loopholes, and the policies of successive governments on this issue have not been very consistent. Therefore, for a relatively long period, there have been rumors that Swedish arms dealers are engaged in illegal arms trading, selling weapons to embargoed countries through transit countries. In early 1987, the Swedish media exposed that the Nobel Industrial Group's subsidiary, Bofors Company, sold RBS70 laser-guided ground-to-air missiles to the Middle East war zone through transit countries. The report stated that the company exported 5,400 RBS70 missiles from 1979 to 1986, of which 1,189 were sold to countries involved in armed conflicts. After this news was made public, public opinion was outraged, and Bofors Company President Adhep had to announce his resignation. The media also revealed that another subsidiary of the Nobel Industrial Group, the Kemi Company, sold shells and explosives to a certain warring country, and the state-owned FFV Company sold anti-tank artillery to at least 18 countries and regions that are subject to Swedish legislative embargoes. Subsequently, another major bribery case involving Bofors Company was exposed: in 1986, the company, in order to compete with France, bribed $50 million to sign a $1.3 billion arms contract with India. Last summer, the company also smuggled 20 RBS70 missiles to Taiwan through a transit country.

These series of incidents shocked the Swedish public. People criticized these scandals for damaging Sweden's image in the world and worried that Sweden might be drawn into international conflicts. Public opinion strongly demanded severe punishment for those arms dealers who knowingly violated the law.

Currently, a special committee set up by the Swedish parliament is investigating the exposed arms smuggling and bribery cases. The court has summoned three former presidents of Bofors Company, and the prosecutor has requested sentences for these three individuals. Swedish government leaders have repeatedly stated that they will handle those involved in arms smuggling and bribery according to the law. However, some arms dealers are not convinced and claim that the Military Material Export Inspection Bureau has given tacit approval for arms export smuggling. Former Bofors President Adhep stated during his trial that the company had reported the export of weapons to conflict zones through transit countries to relevant government departments in advance. From the results of the court trial, some government officials seem to be involved in these cases. To restrict arms smuggling, the Swedish government has recently made many specific regulations regarding arms exports. Whether these measures can prevent the aforementioned illegal activities remains to be seen.

### 瑞典军火走私案

　　瑞典军火走私案
　　本报记者　顾耀铭
    近年来，瑞典几家军火公司接连被揭露有走私和贿赂等非法行为，在瑞典社会引起强烈反响。
    军火业是瑞典的传统工业之一，全国从业人员现有2.8万，8家军火公司的年营业额达180亿瑞典克朗（约合28亿美元）。
    瑞典位于北约和华约两大军事集团之间，历届政府都主张要有一定的国防力量支持其和平中立的外交政策，因此，应拥有“独立多样的”军火业。目前瑞典军队70％的装备是由本国制造的，每年还有少量的军火出口。但是根据议会立法，出口军火须由政府批准，受到严格限制，不准向交战国和局势紧张地区，尤其是超级大国介入的地区出口武器。
    然而，立法虽严，仍然有空可钻，加之各届政府在这个问题上的政策不很连贯。因此，较长一段时间来时有传闻说，瑞典军火商在从事非法军火买卖，通过中转国卖给禁运的国家。1987年初，瑞典报界揭露，诺贝尔工业集团的子公司——博福斯公司通过中转国将RBS70激光制导地对空导弹售向中东交战地区。报道说，该公司1979年至1986年出口了5400枚RBS70导弹，其中有1189枚卖给了正在交战中的国家。此事公布后，舆论大哗，博福斯公司总裁阿德波不得不宣布辞职。报界还披露，诺贝尔工业集团的另一家子公司——凯米公司将炮弹和炸药卖给了某交战国，国营的FFV公司将反坦克火炮卖给至少18个属瑞典立法禁运的国家和地区。接着，又有一桩涉及博福斯公司的巨额行贿案公之于众：1986年，该公司为了跟法国竞争，不惜行贿5000万美元，同印度签署了价值约13亿美元的军火合同。去年夏天，这家公司又通过中转国向台湾走私20枚RBS70导弹。
    这一系列案件令瑞典公众震惊。人们指责这些丑闻损害了瑞典在世界上的形象，担心瑞典因此被卷入国际冲突。舆论强烈要求严惩那些知法违法的军火商。
    目前，瑞典议会设立的一个特别委员会正在调查被揭发出来的军火走私和行贿案。法院已传讯博福斯公司的3名前总裁，检察官要求对这3人判刑。瑞典政府领导人也再三表示要依法查处犯有军火走私罪和行贿罪的军火商。然而，一些军火商不服，声称军事物资出口检查署对军火出口走私曾给予默许。博福斯前总裁阿德波在受审时表示，该公司经中转国向交战区出口武器一事事先向政府有关部门作过报告。从法院审讯的结果看，一些政府官员与这些案子似有牵连。为了限制军火走私，瑞典政府最近又对军火出口作了很多具体的规定。至于能否防范上述这类非法行为，还是个问号。
