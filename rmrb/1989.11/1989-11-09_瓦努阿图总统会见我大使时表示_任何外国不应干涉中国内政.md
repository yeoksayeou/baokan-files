    瓦努阿图总统会见我大使时表示
    任何外国不应干涉中国内政
    新华社北京11月8日电  斐济消息：瓦努阿图总统弗·卡·蒂马卡塔和总理沃·利尼分别于11月3日和10月31日在首都维拉港会见了中国驻斐济兼驻瓦努阿图大使徐明远。
    会见中，蒂马卡塔总统和利尼总理对中国在维拉港设立大使馆表示欢迎，并认为中国大使馆在维拉港的建立，不仅能增进两国政府和两国人民之间的友好和了解，而且会促进两国在经济、文化等各方面的合作。
    徐大使向蒂马卡塔总统和利尼总理介绍了中国平息反革命暴乱以来国内的稳定局势，阐述了中国在国际关系中对台湾问题的原则立场和态度。
    蒂马卡塔总统对此明确表示，中国平息北京反革命暴乱是中国的内政。瓦努阿图遵守不干涉别国内政的原则，任何外国也不应干涉中国的内政。他还说，瓦努阿图执行一个中国的政策，只承认中华人民共和国并与之建立了外交关系。台湾和中国大陆不论民族和文化都是同一的。
