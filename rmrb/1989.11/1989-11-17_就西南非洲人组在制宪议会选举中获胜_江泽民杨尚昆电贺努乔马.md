	To the Chairman of the South West Africa People's Organization, Sam Nujoma,

	We are delighted to learn that under your leadership, the South West Africa People's Organization has won the majority of seats in the Namibian Constitutional Assembly election. At this historic moment, we, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Government of China, and the Chinese people, extend our warmest congratulations to you, to the South West Africa People's Organization, and to the people of Namibia.

	The South West Africa People's Organization has led the Namibian people in a long and arduous struggle against South African colonialism and racism, fighting for national independence, and has won the support of African countries and the respect of the international community. The victory of the South West Africa People's Organization in the Constitutional Assembly election is the fruit of the Namibian people's long and heroic struggle and a great victory for the entire continent of Africa. We are confident that under your leadership, the South West Africa People's Organization will be able to unite all patriotic forces in Namibia and, relying on the entire Namibian people, achieve national independence as scheduled.

	In the common struggle against colonialism and racism, the Chinese people and the Namibian people have forged a deep friendship. We are convinced that when the sun of independence shines over this land of Namibia, which has endured so much, the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Namibia will develop on a new basis.

	Jiang Zemin
	General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
