The night at Mount Wutai is serene and sweet, yet it is filled with a sense of mystery. After dinner, my companion, Old Zhao, invited me for a walk. We headed north along a small asphalt road.

We strolled slowly, savoring the fresh air. The fields by the roadside still bore a patch of green, while the rolling hills were bare, covered only by sparse grass and shrubs. The mountains in the north are often like this, exposing their chests and bones, displaying their robust physiques and unyielding spirits. As we reached the end of the path, we unexpectedly saw a tent set up, with a glow of light emanating from within. We walked towards the light and found two young men cooking. A basin was filled with freshly picked, vibrant mushrooms. It turned out they were beekeepers from the south, who came here every year to raise bees and collect honey. Regardless of wind or rain, they camped outdoors every day.

“Your work must be very hard!” I said to them.

“We’re used to it,” one of them replied. “We find sweetness in hardship; it’s nothing.” I thought to myself, they traverse the green mountains, seeking fragrance, like bees collecting nectar for people, requiring a spirit like that of a bee.

We bid farewell to the beekeepers and returned to the main road via a small path. By then, the sky had completely darkened. The mountain peaks stood tall, draped in black, surrounding us. In the distance and at higher elevations, temples had lit their lamps, twinkling faintly. Looking south, at the highest point of the mountain, a faint glow could be seen, flickering intermittently. In this land of temples and forests, the dim light flickering in and out added to the mystery. All around was pitch black, not a single figure in sight, only the rustling of the autumn wind and the murmur of flowing water. Old Zhao stared at the distant light and suddenly said, “This must be the legendary Buddha’s light! Tonight, we are fortunate to see it, and tomorrow we will surely have good luck.” I replied, “Who has seen the Buddha’s light? They say it is incredibly bright, but this is just a tiny lamp.”

Before I could finish, Old Zhao suddenly exclaimed, “Ouch!” and fell into a small ditch by the roadside. I helped him up, saying, “Good luck, but you’ve taken a tumble!” We both laughed.

The night at Mount Wutai is quiet and dark. The mountains, temples, and villages have all fallen asleep, perhaps even the great Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are resting. Only the stars in the night sky and the lamps on the mountain flicker their eyes. I felt a stirring in my heart and looked back. The beekeepers’ tent still had a lamp shining through, like a newly bloomed yellow chrysanthemum, giving a sense of fullness and warmth. The mysterious feeling from the temple lights gradually faded away.

　　五台山的夜光
　　晓晴
    五台山的夜是宁静、甜蜜的，同时也充满了一种神秘的感觉。晚饭之后，同行的老赵约我去散步。我们沿着一条小柏油路向北而去。
    我们慢慢走着，尽情地呼吸这里的新鲜空气。路旁的田野里还泛着一片绿色，起伏的山峦光秃秃的，只有一层疏稀的青草和荆丛。北方的山大都是这样，裸露着胸膛和肌骨，显示着它坚强的体魄和不屈的性格。当走到尽头时，竟然看见了一个支开的帐篷，里面透出一片灯光。我们迎着光亮走去，见两个青年人正在做饭，一个脸盆里盛满了刚刚采来的鲜亮的蘑菇。原来他们是从南方来的养蜂人，每年都到这里来放蜂采蜜。不管刮风下雨，天天都在野外宿营。
      “你们工作多辛苦呀！”我对他们说。
      “我们习惯了，以苦为甜，没什么。”其中一个答道。我心里想，他们踏遍青山，寻觅芬芳，像蜜蜂一样为人们采蜜，需要有蜜蜂一样的精神。
    我们辞别了养蜂人，沿小路又回到了大路上，这时候天空已完全黑下来。山峰像披上了黑色的衣衫，耸立在我们的周围。远处及高处的寺院里燃起了灯火，星星点点，一闪一闪。向南望去，在山峰的最高处，依稀看见一灯荧光，忽明忽暗，变幻不定。在崇山峻岭遍布森森寺庙的佛地，微弱的灯光忽隐忽现，更加重了这里的神秘色彩。周围黑洞洞的，连一个人影也没有，只有瑟瑟秋风的回响和潺潺流水的低吟。老赵凝视远处的灯亮，忽然说：“这大概就是所谓的佛光吧！今夜有幸得见，明日定能吉星高照。”我便也说了一句：“有谁见过佛光？都说佛光是无比耀眼的，怎么竟然是一灯如豆？”还没等我说完，老赵突然“唉呀”了一声，跌倒在路旁的小泥沟里，我上前一边扶他一边说：“吉星高照，摔了一跤！”他和我都笑了起来。
    五台山的夜静悄悄、黑黢黢的，大山、庙宇、村庄都进入梦乡了，恐怕连那些大佛、菩萨也睡了。只有夜空的繁星和山上的灯盏闪动着眼睛。我心有所动，回眸望去，养蜂人的帐篷里还透着那盏风雨灯所射出的灯光，那灯光宛若一朵初绽的黄菊花；给人一种充实和亲切感，而寺庙的灯火压在我心头的神秘感渐渐消逝了。
