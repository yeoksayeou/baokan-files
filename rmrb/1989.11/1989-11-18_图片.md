Chinese paintings from various dynasties have long been cherished by stamp collectors. Recently, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications issued a set of special stamps titled "Contemporary Artwork Selection (1)," consisting of three stamps: "The Legend of the White Snake" by Ye Qianyu, "Light Rain over Li River" by Li Keran, and "Forward March" by Wu Zuoren. The 83-year-old contemporary artist, Mr. Zhou Huimin, who is renowned for his grape paintings, created the first-day cover for this set of art stamps. The image showcases the masterpieces of these four famous artists. (Bi Sheng)
