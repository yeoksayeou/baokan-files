At the 1989 National Minority Children's Development Forum, Director Wu Beiqiu of the China Children's Development Center told me that there is a young woman from Shenyang who has been working in Tibet for ten years.

Identifying He Wei was not difficult. She always walked beside a woman dressed in Tibetan attire. Dressed in a white shirt and black skirt, she stood tall and elegant. Her lovely face bore the characteristic smile of an "angel in white," one that inspires trust and warmth.

But she was not weak—any woman who could endure working at an altitude of 3,888 meters, where the body is deprived of 46% oxygen, for ten years in Gyangze is certainly not weak, I thought.

In 1976, He Wei graduated from high school and became one of over a hundred young people from Shenyang who went to Tibet. From the northeast to the southwest, He Wei traversed a long diagonal, but the greater distance was not spatial but cultural, ideological, and ethnic.

He Wei studied at a hospital in Shenyang for three years and then went to Shandong Medical College for further training in "pediatric clinical practice." She then became a pediatrician at the Gyangze People's Hospital (now the Maternal and Child Health Hospital), and her experiences deepened.

Initially, adapting to the environment in Tibet was a very arduous process. Transportation was inconvenient, language was a barrier, drinking butter tea, eating tsampa, and drinking barley wine... "When in Rome, do as the Romans do" was not easy. But He Wei had to do it—to make the Tibetans close to her and trust her. Tibet implemented free medical care, but the devoutly religious Tibetans would rather climb mountains and cross rivers to temples to pray for divine blessings than go to the nearby hospital for treatment. The rate of traditional childbirth in cities was as high as 90%, and some women believed that childbirth was a shameful affair, not going to the hospital but letting the elderly at home deliver the baby in the cattle pen, tying the umbilical cord with unsterilized wool. "Tibet's dry climate, strong ultraviolet radiation, and long duration of sunlight would otherwise result in many cases of tetanus, and the mortality rate would be even higher," He Wei told me with a sense of relief.

After two years, He Wei could already speak fluent Tibetan to tell the Tibetans to go to the hospital when they were sick, that smearing soot on the nose to drive away ghosts and burning incense at temples would not cure diseases. She gradually became familiar with the Tibetans, and their feelings deepened unknowingly. Naturally, the most convincing thing was the medical results.

He Wei said, "When the time comes, you have to deal with whatever situation arises. It's like being forced to lead ducks to water, acting as both a nurse and a doctor. You have to dare to practice and learn from practice, so your skills improve quickly."

To better serve Tibetan women and children, every one and a half years, the three months of leave became He Wei's fully utilized learning opportunity. She used her leave twice to study in Shenyang, arranging her own hospital to pay for her studies, listening to experienced professors and attending doctors' lectures, understanding the medical standards and clinical developments in the interior. She not only studied pediatrics but also learned acupuncture for three months. She said, "In remote Tibetan villages, when encountering patients with headaches or toothaches, acupuncture is both effective and convenient." When she heard that Shenyang Medical University was offering an electrocardiogram learning class, she rushed to study for 20 days. As soon as this class ended, she immediately enrolled in an attending physician training class. She believed she had the responsibility to bring the medical technology from the interior back to promote the development of medical and health work in the border areas and improve the health level of the Tibetans.

This is He Wei—a ordinary Han girl who dedicated her most beautiful youth to Tibet and to the maternal and child health cause of the Tibetan people.

Over the ten years, He Wei's originally fair skin gradually darkened; the dry climate and rampant sandstorms often caused her to have nosebleeds; ultraviolet sensitivity caused pimples on her face; her lovely son was left with her aging and weak parents, and every year during her leave, the child would shake his little hand and cry, "Mom, don't go to Tibet!"

He Wei paid a lot. Many of her former companions had already returned to the interior one by one, and the practical difficulties facing her family forced He Wei to apply to return to Shenyang. But she still cared about the health of Tibetan women and children, and when she talked about the backwardness of medicine in Tibet, her brow furrowed with worry. She said, "As long as I am in Tibet, I will do my best every day." She is a sincere and simple person, and when she heard that I was going to write about her, she was full of concerns. She smiled and asked if I knew that there was a Tibetan saying: "If you do well, you can't leave; if you do poorly, you leave quickly."

But I think the era of treating advanced and model figures as "gods" who are not of this world has passed. I finally wrote this article. Because I believe that no matter where she goes, He Wei will not forget her cause, will not forget the Tibetan plateau where she struggled for ten years, and will not forget the women and children of Tibet.

    高原上的白衣天使
    ——访西藏日喀则妇幼保健院儿科医师何薇
    本报记者  王娜梅
    在1989年少数民族儿童发展研讨会上，中国儿童发展中心的伍蓓秋主任告诉我，这里有一位在西藏高原工作了10个春秋的沈阳姑娘。
    认出何薇并不太难，她总走在一位穿藏族服装的女同志身边，白衫黑裙、亭亭玉立，秀丽的脸庞上是“白衣天使”特有的那种让人一见便生信赖的亲切温馨的笑容。
    但她并不柔弱——能在海拔3888米、人体缺氧46％的日喀则高原坚持工作10年的女性肯定不是弱者，我想。
    1976年，何薇高中毕业，成为当时沈阳去西藏插队百余名青年中的一位。从祖国的东北到西南，何薇走了一条漫长的对角线，但比空间跨度更大的是习俗、是观念、是民族的差异。
    何薇到沈阳医院学习了3年，又到山东医学院进修“儿科临床”，然后成为日喀则人民医院（现为妇幼保健院）一名儿科医生，这以后，她对此感受更深。
    初到西藏，对环境的适应是个很艰苦的过程。交通不便，语言不通，喝酥油茶、吃抓糌粑、喝青稞酒……“入乡随俗”并不容易。但何薇必须做——为了让藏民亲近她、信任她。西藏实行免费医疗，可宗教信仰虔诚的藏民们有病宁可翻山越岭去寺庙跪求神佛的福佑，而不去近在咫尺的医院治疗。城镇旧法接生率高达90％，有些妇女认为生孩子是见不得人的丑事，不去医院而让家中老人接生，将孩子生在牛圈里，用不消毒的羊毛将脐带一扎完事。“西藏气候干燥、紫外线照射强且时间长，不然不知要出多少破伤风，死亡率还要高。”何薇不无庆幸地对我说。
    两年下来，何薇已能用挺熟练的藏语告诉藏民有病要及时去医院，用锅灰抹鼻尖驱鬼、到寺庙烧香磕头是治不了病的。她和藏民们逐渐熟悉，感情也在不知不觉中加深。自然，最有说服力的还是医疗效果。
    何薇说：“到时候遇到什么情况都要自己处理，简直是赶着鸭子上架，一个人又当护士，又是医生。这就要大胆实践，在实践中学习，因此业务提高也快。”
    为了更好地为藏族妇女儿童服务，每隔一年半，那三个月的探亲假成了何薇充分利用的学习机会。她两次利用探亲时间，在沈阳自己联系医院自费学习，听有经验的教授、主治医生讲课，了解内地医疗水平、临床发展动态。她不光学儿科，还学了3个月的针灸。她说：“在偏僻的藏乡，遇到病人头痛、牙疼什么的，扎针效果既好又方便。”听说沈阳医大办心电图学习班，她又跑去学习了20天，这个学习班刚结束，她立刻又参加了主治医师进修班。她认为自己有责任将内地的医疗技术带回去，促进边疆医疗保健工作的开展，提高藏民的健康水平。
    这就是何薇——一个把自己一生最美好的青春年华献给了西藏、献给了藏族妇女儿童保健事业的普普通通的汉族姑娘。
    10年中，何薇本来白白的皮肤逐渐变黑；干燥的气候、狂肆的风沙使她常常流鼻血；紫外线过敏脸上起疙瘩；可爱的儿子放在年迈体弱的父母身边，每年一次的探亲假，孩子一见她出门就急得直摇小手喊：“妈妈不去西藏！”
    ……何薇付出了很多。当年的同伴许多已陆续返回内地，家庭面临的实际困难迫使何薇提出了回沈阳的申请。但她依然惦念着西藏妇女儿童的健康，谈起西藏医药上的落后，她的眉宇间染上一层忧虑。她说：“我在西藏一天就要好好干一天。”她是个淳厚朴实的人，听说我要写她，她顾虑重重。她笑着问我知道不知道西藏有句顺口溜：“干得好走不了，干得坏走得快。”
    但我想，把先进、模范人物当作不食人间烟火的“神”的年代已经过去了，终于写下这篇文字。因为我相信，不论走到哪里，何薇都不会忘记她的事业，不会忘记有她10年奋斗足迹的西藏高原，不会忘记西藏的妇女儿童。
