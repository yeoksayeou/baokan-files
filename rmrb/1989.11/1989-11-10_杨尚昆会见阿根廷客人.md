    Yang Shangkun Meets Argentine Guests

    Beijing, November 9 (Xinhua) — Yang Shangkun, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and President of the People's Republic of China, said that the recently concluded Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee had specifically discussed the issue of adjusting and developing the economy. The basic idea is: "We must continue to develop our economy, continue to implement the policy of reform and opening up, and spend some time to adjust and rectify the shortcomings that have emerged in the current economic development." He added that this would probably take two to three years. Of course, adjustment is not stopping economic development, but adjusting while developing.

    Yang Shangkun made these remarks this evening at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse when he met with the Argentine delegation led by Eduardo Menem, a member of the National Committee of the Argentine Justicialist Party and Acting President of the Senate, who was invited to visit China.

    He said that China is not only stable in Beijing but also stable throughout the country. The Chinese Party and government attach great importance to maintaining a stable situation. Without stability, nothing can be accomplished.

    When talking about the relationship between the two parties and the two countries, Yang Shangkun said that we attach great importance to developing friendly relations with Latin American countries and political parties. China highly appreciates Argentina's active role in Latin America and international affairs, supports Argentina and Latin American countries in their efforts to maintain world and regional peace, safeguard national sovereignty, establish a new international economic order, and develop national economies to improve the welfare of the people. He believed that the delegation's visit this time would yield positive results. Yang Shangkun also thanked President Carlos Menem for his invitation to visit Argentina, saying that he would visit the beautiful country of Argentina next year. He also said that he had extended an invitation to President Menem to visit China and asked the Speaker to convey his invitation again upon his return home.

    Eduardo Menem said that they have friendly feelings towards the Chinese Party and the Chinese people. They have never believed the exaggerated propaganda by foreign media about the events that took place in China in June. The visit to China further proves this.

    Eduardo Menem also highly praised China's adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between countries.

    Ju Liang, Minister of the International Liaison Department of the CPC Central Committee, was present at the meeting.

    杨尚昆会见阿根廷客人
    本报北京11月9日讯　记者孙毅报道：中共中央政治局委员、国家主席杨尚昆说，刚刚开完的十三届五中全会专门讨论了调整和发展经济的问题，其基本思想就是：“要继续发展我们的经济，继续执行改革开放政策，花一段时间来调整、整顿现在经济发展中出现的缺点。”他接着说，这大概需要两三年的时间。当然，调整不是停止发展经济，而是在发展中调整。
    杨尚昆是今晚在首都宾馆会见应邀来访的阿根廷正义党全国委员会委员、参议院临时议长爱德华多·梅内姆为团长的阿根廷正义党代表团时讲这番话的。
    他说，现在中国不仅北京是稳定的，全国也是稳定的。中国党和政府非常强调要有一个稳定的局面，没有稳定的局面，什么事情也干不成。
    在谈到两党、两国关系时，杨尚昆说，我们非常重视同拉美国家和政党发展友好关系。中国高度评价阿根廷在拉美和国际事务中的积极作用，支持阿根廷和拉美国家为维护世界及地区和平、为维护国家主权、为建立新的国际经济秩序、为发展民族经济，改善人民生活福利所作的努力。他相信代表团这次访问将会带来积极的结果。杨尚昆还感谢卡洛斯·梅内姆总统对他发出的访阿邀请，他说，他将在明年访问阿根廷这个美丽的国家。他还说，我已经向梅内姆总统发出了访华邀请，请议长先生回国后转达我的再次邀请。
    爱·梅内姆说，我们对中国党和中国人民怀着友好的感情，我们从来没有相信过外国舆论对中国6月发生事情的夸张宣传。通过对中国的访问，更加证明这一点。
    爱·梅内姆还高度赞赏中国奉行的国与国之间和平共处五项原则。
    中联部部长朱良等会见时在座。
