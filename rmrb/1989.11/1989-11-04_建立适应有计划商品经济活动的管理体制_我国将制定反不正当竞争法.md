	Establishing a Management System Suitable for Planned Commodity Economic Activities
	China to Formulate Anti-Unfair Competition Law

	BEIJING, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Peng Chong announced today that the formulation of anti-unfair competition legislation has been included in the legislative plan of the NPC. He pointed out that to further deepen the reform and better promote the development of socialist commodity economy, we are currently rectifying the economic environment and order. Suppressing unfair competition is one of the key tasks in this rectification.

	Peng Chong made these remarks at the opening of the International Seminar on Anti-Unfair Competition held here today.

	The seminar, attended by more than 90 experts and scholars from 15 countries, is co-sponsored by the World Intellectual Property Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Development Programme, the Chinese Society of Economic Law, the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council, and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Chen Muxia, Wang Hanbin, and others attended the opening ceremony.

	Gu Min, president of the Chinese Society of Economic Law, and Arpad Bogsch, director general of the World Intellectual Property Organization of the United Nations, delivered opening speeches respectively.

	Gu Min emphasized that China is a socialist country and will not allow any behavior that seeks illegal economic benefits, violates national laws and social ethics, harms the interests of other economic organizations and individuals in a competitive position in market economic activities, infringes upon the rights of consumers, and disrupts the normal competitive order.

	The reporter learned that since 1985, the people's governments of Wuhan, Shanghai, Jiangxi, and Heilongjiang provinces and municipalities have successively formulated local regulations and rules to stop unfair competition, thus achieving certain results in using economic legal means to stop unfair competition in China.

    建立适应有计划商品经济活动的管理体制
    我国将制定反不正当竞争法
    本报北京11月3日讯　记者毛磊、张志业报道：全国人大常委会副委员长彭冲今天在此间宣布：全国人大立法计划中已经列入了反不正当竞争的立法项目。他指出，为了进一步深化改革，更有利地促进社会主义商品经济的发展，我们目前正在治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序。抑制不正当竞争行为，就是整治中的一项内容。
    彭冲是在今天开幕的反不正当竞争国际研讨会上讲这番话的。
    有15个国家90余位专家、学者参加的反不正当竞争国际研讨会，是由联合国世界知识产权组织、联合国开发署倡议，与中国经济法研究会、国务院法制局、国家工商行政管理局联合举行的。陈慕华、王汉斌等出席了开幕式。
    中国经济法研究会会长顾明、联合国世界知识产权组织总干事鲍格胥分别致开幕词。
    顾明强调，中国是社会主义国家，对牟取非法经济利益、违反国家法律和社会公德、在市场经济活动中损害其它处于竞争地位的经济组织和个人的利益、损害消费者权益、扰乱正常竞争秩序的行为，是绝不允许的。
    记者了解到，自1985年以来，武汉、上海、江西、黑龙江4省市人民政府已先后制定了制止不正当竞争的地方法规、规章，从而使我国在运用经济法律手段制止不正当竞争方面取得一定成效。
