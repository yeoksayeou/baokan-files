MOSCOW, Nov. 13 (Xinhua) — Professor Shcherkin of the All-Union Research Institute for Nature Conservation believes that the Soviet Union's agricultural development guidelines should be revised with a focus on protecting natural resources and the ecological environment.

According to a report in the Soviet magazine "Knowledge is Power," since 1965, fixed assets in Soviet agriculture have increased fourfold, power equipment has nearly tripled, and the use of agricultural chemicals has increased by 1.5 times, with massive investments. However, the total output of crop farming has only increased by 20%, and livestock farming has increased by only 30-40%. Due to waterlogging and the use of fertilizers, the humus layer of the soil has decreased by about 30% over the past 50 years, and the use of organic fertilizers can only compensate for half of the loss.

Therefore, Professor Shcherkin proposes an agricultural development strategy that prioritizes environmental protection and ecological balance.

Concentrate superior forces to cultivate 70% of the good land, and in the 30% of inferior land, 10% of which has a relatively light degree of erosion, can be improved using anti-salinity methods, while the remaining 20% of inferior land can be converted to pasture. Integrate crop and livestock farming. All crop stalks should be used as feed, and animal manure should be returned to the fields, achieving a closed-loop material exchange between crop farming and livestock farming.

Fully utilize the role of fertilizers and restrict waterlogging for soil improvement. It is calculated that 100 kilograms of fertilizer should increase the yield of fodder by 600 kilograms. However, the current effect in the Soviet Union is only one-third of this. Therefore, scientific fertilization is necessary. Waterlogging for soil improvement will wash away the humus layer, leading to soil degradation, and should be restricted.

Professor Shcherkin believes that after taking the above measures, the production of organic fertilizers can increase by nearly onefold, which can increase crop yields by 50% in the short term. Concentrating efforts to cultivate good land can also increase yields by 15%, while also reducing losses in harvesting, transportation, and storage.

    苏联一教授强调保护自然资源
    提出保护生态环境农业发展战略
    新华社莫斯科电　全苏自然保护科研所教授谢尔金认为，应从保护自然资源和生态环境出发，来修改苏联的农业发展纲领。
    据苏联《知识就是力量》杂志报道，1965年以来，苏联农业固定资产增加4倍，动力装备增加近3倍，农用化学剂施用量增加1.5倍，投资巨大。可是种植业总产值仅增加20％，畜牧业产值也只增加30—40％。因水法改良土壤和施用化肥，致使近50年来土壤腐植质层减少30％左右，施用有机肥仅能弥补一半损失。
    因此谢尔金教授提出了以保护环境和生态平衡为主线的农业发展战略。
    集中优势兵力种好70％好地，30％的差地中有10％受侵蚀程度较轻，可采用抗盐碱法加以改良，其余20％差地改种牧草。农畜互补。农作物草茎应全部用作饲料，而牲畜粪便也应施回田地中，使种植业与畜牧业之间的物质交流达到闭合循环的程度。
    充分发挥化肥作用，限制用水法改良土壤。据计算，每100公斤化肥应增产600公斤饲草。但目前苏联还只能收到1／3的效果。所以应当科学施肥。水法改良土壤会冲走腐植质层，使土地贫化，应当限制。
    谢尔金教授认为，采取以上措施后，有机肥产量可增加近一倍，这能使种植业近期增产5成。集中力量种好地又能增产15％，同时还能减少在收获、运输及保存中的损失。
