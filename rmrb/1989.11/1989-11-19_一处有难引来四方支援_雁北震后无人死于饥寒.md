	One Area in Distress Brings Aid from All Directions: No One Dies of Cold in Yanbei After the Earthquake

	Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Su reports: According to the Yanbei Disaster Relief Command, although the season has already turned to severe winter, the four counties of Datong, Yanggao, Hunyuan, and Guangling, which suffered severe earthquake damage, have had no one die of cold and hunger after the earthquake. More than 80,000 disaster victims have not had anyone "head west" or "venture east," and the local people unanimously praise the goodness of socialism.

	After the Datong and Yanggao earthquake, a moving scene of one area suffering and eight areas providing aid quickly emerged. Just a few hours after the earthquake, Party, government, and military leaders from the Yanbei region appeared among the disaster-stricken people. More than 3,000 disaster relief troops braved frequent aftershocks to rescue people's lives and property and to repair winter shelters for the victims. Injured elderly people, veterans, pregnant women, and women who had just given birth were taken to local and military hospitals, where they received good care. Led by Party members and cadres, Party and government agencies, mass organizations, factories, enterprises, neighborhoods, and schools in the disaster area all launched fundraising and mutual aid activities. In less than 10 days, various units and individuals in Yanbei and Datong City alone donated nearly 1 million yuan.

	At the same time, provinces and cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, and Fujian, as well as the Beijing Military Region and various units stationed in Shanxi, sent disaster relief materials and funds to the disaster area.

	Tianjin City collected 64 truckloads of urgently needed steel, wood, tarpaulin, and plastic film for the disaster area in just one week and transported them to the disaster area overnight.

	The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region specially sent 5,000 bags of milk powder for the elderly, infants, and injured in the disaster area.

	Hundreds of retired senior cadres from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs searched their homes and found more than 1,000 items of quilts, cotton clothes, single clothes, and shoes to send to the disaster victims to keep them warm.

	Letters of condolence from military camps and schools, signed "Love the People" and "Learning Peak," along with donations, also warmed the hearts of the disaster-stricken people. A middle-aged woman from Dazhuang Village in Datong County, Liu Runzhi, excitedly told the reporter: "After my family builds a new house, I will write a couplet: Long live the Communist Party! Long live the People's Liberation Army! Socialism is good!"

    一处有难引来四方支援  雁北震后无人死于饥寒
    本报讯　新华社记者赵苏报道：记者从雁北救灾指挥部获悉：尽管时令已进入严冬，可是遭受严重地震灾害的大同、阳高、浑源、广灵四县，震后无一人死于饥寒，8万多灾民无一人“走西口”、“闯关东”，灾区群众同声称道社会主义好。
    大同、阳高地震发生后，很快出现了一方受灾，八方支援的动人情景。震后几小时，雁北地区的党政军领导同志就出现在受灾群众中，3000多名救灾部队官兵冒着频繁余震，奋力抢救群众生命财产，为灾民抢修过冬暖棚。伤病的老人、烈军属、孕妇、产妇，被接到地方和部队医院，受到良好照顾。在党员干部带动下，灾区的党政机关、群众团体、厂矿企业、街道、学校等单位，纷纷开展捐款捐物、自救互救活动，不到10天，仅雁北和大同市的一些单位和个人就捐款近百万元。
    与此同时，北京、上海、辽宁、江苏、浙江、湖北、福建等省市，北京军区、驻晋各部队支援的救灾物资、救灾款也相继发往灾区。
    天津市仅用了一周时间，就筹集了64卡车灾区急需的钢材、木材、油毡、薄膜等物资，连夜运往灾区。
    内蒙古自治区专门为灾区的老人、婴儿和伤病员送来5000袋奶粉。
    外交部数百名离休老干部翻箱倒柜，找出1000多件棉被、棉衣、单衣、鞋子，送给灾民御寒。
    一封封来自军营、学校的署名“爱民”、“学锋”的慰问信和寄来的慰问款，更使灾区群众感到温暖。大同县大王村中年妇女刘润芝激动地对记者说：“我家盖起新房后，要写副对联：共产党万岁！解放军万岁！社会主义好！”
