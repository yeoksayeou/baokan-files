Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 8th.

Democratic Kampuchea Radio today issued a commentary refuting Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach's attempt to portray Vietnam's opposition to the establishment of a four-party government in Cambodia as "non-interference in Cambodian internal affairs."

The commentary stated that Nguyen Co Thach shamelessly claimed that the formation of a government is an internal affair, and "all foreign countries must not interfere in Cambodia's internal affairs." The commentary said this is Vietnam's tactic of "the thief crying 'stop thief'." It is well known that the root cause of the Cambodian problem is that Vietnam dispatched tens of thousands of troops to invade Cambodia, blatantly violating the United Nations Charter and international legal norms, and imposed a puppet government on the Cambodian people. Vietnam has long been blatantly and brutally interfering in Cambodia's internal affairs, and it must take responsibility for resolving the Cambodian problem and cannot shirk its responsibilities.

The commentary said that Vietnam's opposition to the establishment of a four-party government in Cambodia is because Vietnam wants to maintain its long-term occupation of Cambodia after changing its appearance. In September of this year, when Vietnam supposedly "completely withdrew its troops," it secretly left behind tens of thousands of military forces in various disguises, still controlling the various departments of the Phnom Penh government from the central to the grassroots levels, and the power at various levels of the military. It continues to carry out its strategy of aggression and expansion and the establishment of an Indochina Federation under the banner of the Phnom Penh puppet regime.

The commentary believes that this is the fundamental reason why Vietnam cannot and does not dare to accept the Cambodian four-party joint government. If a four-party government is established, Vietnam will no longer be able to continue to rule Cambodia.

Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, November 7th.

Thai newspapers reported today that the Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh puppet army launched a "major military offensive" against the Democratic Kampuchea resistance forces in western Cambodia starting on the 6th, aiming to retake strategic locations such as Banteay Meas that were recently lost.

The newspapers quoted Thai military sources as saying that the Democratic Kampuchea resistance forces and the Vietnamese puppet army have been engaged in fierce battles near the 502nd and 10th highways in western Cambodia over the past three days. More than fifty shells fired by the Vietnamese puppet army fell into Thai territory near the Cambodian-Thai border, forcing more than two hundred Thai border residents to evacuate.

The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea captured the strategic town of Banteay Meas and the city of Samlot in western Cambodia's Battambang Province at the end of October; the National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia and the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces also simultaneously captured many important enemy positions in Oddar Meanchey Province. Since October 26th, the Phnom Penh government has imposed a curfew in Battambang City, and on the 30th, it also imposed a curfew in Phnom Penh. Recently, the Phnom Penh regime has dispatched several divisions of troops to western Cambodia, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack.

### 民柬电台批驳越“不干涉柬内政”谬论  金边伪军发动新的军事进攻

    民柬电台批驳越“不干涉柬内政”谬论
    金边伪军发动新的军事进攻
    新华社北京十一月八日电  民主柬埔寨电台今天发表评论，批驳越南外长阮基石把越南反对在柬埔寨成立四方政府的立场美化为“不干涉柬埔寨内政”的谬论。
    电台评论说，阮基石恬不知耻地说，建立政府是内政问题，“一切外国不准干涉柬埔寨内政”。评论说，这是越南“贼喊捉贼”的伎俩。众所周知，柬埔寨问题产生的根源就是越南出动十几万军队侵占了柬埔寨，粗暴违背了联合国宪章和国际法准则，并把用刺刀扶植的一个傀儡政府强加在柬埔寨人民的头上。越南早已公然野蛮地干涉了柬埔寨内政，它必须对解决柬埔寨问题负责，不能逃避责任。
    评论说，越南之所以反对在柬埔寨成立四方政府，是因为越南要维护其改头换面后的对柬长期侵占的事实。越南今年九月所谓“全部撤军”时，暗中留下各种形式伪装军事力量十万余人，仍然控制着金边政府各部门、从中央到基层以及军队的各级权力，继续打着金边傀儡招牌实施它侵略扩张和建立印支联邦的战略。
    评论认为，这就是越南不能、也不敢接受柬四方联合政府的根本原因。如果成立四方政府，越南就无法继续统治柬埔寨了。
    新华社曼谷十一月七日电  泰国报纸今天报道，越南支持的金边伪军从六日开始，在柬埔寨西部向民柬抵抗力量发起一次“主要军事攻势”，旨在夺回不久前丢失的拜林等战略要地。
    报纸援引泰军方人士的话说，民柬抵抗力量与越伪军过去三天来在柬西部五○二号和十号公路附近激战。有五十多发越伪军发射的炮弹落在柬泰边境泰国境内，迫使二百多泰国边境居民撤离。
    民柬国民军于十月底先后攻克了柬西部马德望省的战略重镇拜林和三洛县城；西哈努克民族军和高棉人民民族解放军也同时在奥多棉吉省攻占了许多重要的敌军阵地。从十月二十六日以来，金边政府在马德望市实行戒严，三十日又在金边实行宵禁。不久前，金边政权向柬西部增派了几个师的兵力，伺机反扑。
