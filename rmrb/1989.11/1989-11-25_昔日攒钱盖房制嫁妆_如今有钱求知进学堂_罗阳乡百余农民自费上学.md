In the past two years, 105 farmers from Luoyang Township in Gancheng County, Jiangsu Province, have paid to attend universities, vocational schools, and various correspondence courses.

In the past, farmers in this township would "build new houses, prepare dowries, and hold grand weddings." In recent years, with the further development of the rural commodity economy, they have come to realize that "having a new tiled house is not as good as entering a school, and to become wealthy in the long term, seeking knowledge is the way forward." Therefore, they have chosen their own paths based on their strengths and interests, taking out their personal savings and dowry money, and finding ways to enter schools to learn skills. This year, the farmers who paid to enter schools have mostly chosen majors that are in urgent need by society, such as agricultural science and technology, aquaculture and poultry farming, construction, medical services, accounting, kindergarten teaching, and home appliance repair.

Five kindergarten teachers from Zhengzhuang Village, Liu Li, Wang Xiaohan from Qian Luoyang Village, Dongna from Hou Luoyang Village, and Liu Caixia from Dongguan Village, each contributed 800 yuan from their personal savings to study early childhood education at Huaihai University. After a year of study, they mastered the teaching methods of six courses: early childhood education, early childhood psychology, early childhood hygiene, language, general knowledge, arithmetic, music, physical education, and art. Now, their teaching level has significantly improved, and the quality of their teaching is at the forefront of the township.

Juzhuang Village's young farmer and breeding expert, Zhu Rui, to better pursue the path of circular breeding of chickens and pigs, paid to participate in the breeding correspondence class organized by the Nanchang Science and Technology Information Society.

Recently, 12 kindergarten teachers from this township each contributed 1,000 yuan in tuition fees to attend the county teachers' further education school for full-time study of early childhood education courses. Additionally, 27 people each contributed 160 yuan to attend kindergarten teacher correspondence courses.

What is even more noteworthy is that the township's Party Committee Secretary, Wang Mingdian, and the township head, Dong Shuyu, both took the lead in participating in the study of the "Chinese Farmers' Correspondence University."

　　昔日攒钱盖房制嫁妆　如今有钱求知进学堂
　　罗阳乡百余农民自费上学
　　王明绪　李家源
    近两年来，江苏省赣榆县罗阳乡已有105名农民自费上大学、中专和各类函授学校。
    过去，这个乡农民是：“盖新房，制嫁妆，大操大办娶新娘。”近年来，随着农村商品经济的进一步发展，他们认识到：“家有新瓦房，不如进学堂，要想长期富，求知是出路。”于是，他们根据自己的特长和爱好，纷纷拿出私人积蓄和嫁妆钱，各找门路，进校求知学技。今年自费入校的农民所学的专业，大多是社会急需的农业科技、水产和家禽养殖、建筑、医务、财会、幼师和家电维修等。
    郑庄村刘丽、前罗阳村王晓寒、后罗阳村董娜、东关村刘彩霞等5名幼儿教师，去年“六·一”前夕，每人拿出800元私人积蓄，到淮海大学进修幼师专业。经过一年的学习，他们掌握了幼儿教育学、幼儿心理学、幼儿卫生学和语言、常识、计算、音乐、体育、美术等6门课程教学法。现在，他们的教学水平有较大提高，教学质量跃居全乡上游。
    朱庄村青年农民、养殖能手朱瑞，为走好循环养殖鸡、猪这条富裕路，自费参加了南昌科技情报社养殖函授班的学习。
    最近，这个乡又有12名幼儿教师每人拿出1000元学费，到县教师进修学校脱产进修幼儿教育课程。有27人每人拿出160元上幼师函授。
    更有意思的是，这个乡党委书记王明田、乡长董淑玉都带头参加了《中国农民函授大学》的学习。
