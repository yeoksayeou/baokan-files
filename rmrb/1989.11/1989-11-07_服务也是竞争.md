I bought a refrigerator, and half a year ago, I discovered that the seal had a small gap. Following a friend's method of checking, I placed a lit flashlight inside the refrigerator at night, closed the door, and indeed, light leaked through. A poor seal would naturally affect the cooling effect. I wanted to have it repaired under warranty, but the warranty card did not have the address of the repair department, so I had no idea how to contact them. Moreover, thinking about moving this bulky item back and forth was quite troublesome, so I could only make do with it.

When spending money to buy goods, consumers not only demand genuine products at a fair price but also expect good after-sales service. If there are any issues, they should be able to have them repaired or exchanged promptly and conveniently. This is especially true for large, durable consumer goods like refrigerators and televisions.

Currently, the living standards of the Chinese people are not high. Many people work hard for years to save up enough money to buy a refrigerator or television. Production and sales enterprises should be responsible to their customers, truly offering guarantees for repairs, replacements, and returns. This is not an unreasonable demand.

After-sales service is a means of enterprise competition. In situations where the price and quality are the same, the product with better after-sales service will be more favored by consumers. Only enterprises that have good product quality, reasonable prices, and attentive service can stand firm in the fierce market competition. If enterprises are satisfied with short-term sales and neglect after-sales service, harming the interests of consumers, in the end, they will lose customers and the market.

Paying attention to after-sales service is a necessary awareness for enterprises in modern commodity economies. It also reflects respect and care for people, bringing warmth to consumers. When manufacturers provide door-to-door repairs, they inconvenience themselves but bring convenience to thousands of households. Such manufacturers will naturally gain the trust of consumers.

    服务也是竞争
    皮子
    买了一台冰箱，半年前发现密封条有一处不严。按照友人提供的检验方法，夜里将一亮着的手电筒置入冰箱，关上箱门，果然漏光。密封不严，必然影响制冷效果。想去保修，可保修证上并无维修部地址，如何联系，一片茫然，再一想到将此庞然大物抬来搬去着实麻烦，只好将就着用。
    花钱购物，消费者不仅要求货真价实，也要求得到良好的售后服务，如有毛病能够及时方便地进行维修以至退换，像冰箱、彩电这些大件耐用消费品更是如此。
    目前，我国人民生活并不富裕，许多人辛辛苦苦多年积攒一点钱，才买回冰箱、彩电之类的大件，生产、销售企业应该对用户负责，真正保换、保退、保修。这不是什么过分要求。
    售后服务是企业竞争的手段。在同等价格、质量水平下，谁的商品售后服务好，谁的商品就更受用户欢迎。只有产品质量好、价格合理、服务周到的企业，才能在激烈的市场竞争中立于不败之地。如果满足于一时的畅销，放松售后服务，损害了用户的利益，到头来企业就会失去用户，丢掉市场。
    重视售后服务，是现代商品经济中企业应有的意识，它还体现了对人的尊重和关心，带给消费者的是一片温暖。厂家维修上门，麻烦了自己，却方便了千家万户。这样的厂家自然会得到消费者的信任。
