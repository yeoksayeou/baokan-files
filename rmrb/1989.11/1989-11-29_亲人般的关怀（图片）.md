    Warmth Like Family
    A student named Huang Xiaohui from Jinxing Middle School in Jinxi is hospitalized at the First Hospital of Beijing Medical University with a large tumor in her liver. She was told that the surgery would cost around 10,000 yuan. For a typical worker's family, coming up with such a large sum of money all at once is impossible. This situation has left Huang Xiaohui's family in a state of panic. Her parents returned to Jinxi to borrow money, leaving Huang Xiaohui alone in Beijing. She wrote a letter to the "Listener's Voice" program on Beijing People's Radio, seeking help. On November 24, this letter was broadcast. News of her plight spread quickly, and people rushed to offer assistance, sending money to Beijing Radio. A primary school student said, "I have 20 yuan, which my grandparents gave me for the Spring Festival. I was saving up to buy a small radio, but I'll use it to help Xiaohui sister get her treatment first." On the morning of November 28, the elderly woman in the picture, who is nearly 70 years old and lives in Xibeihe, came to the radio station. She said, "I felt sad after hearing the broadcast. To save the child, I am willing to contribute whatever I can, no matter how difficult it is for me." In just over four days, more than 7,000 yuan has been raised.

　　亲人般的关怀
    在北医大第一医院住院的锦西女中学生黄晓辉肝部长了个大瘤子，听说动手术得花上万元。一个普通工人之家，一下子哪拿得出这么多钱。这可急坏了黄晓辉一家。父母亲返回锦西借钱，小黄举目无亲。她写信给北京人民广播电台《听众之声》节目，请求帮助。11月24日这封信广播了。消息一传开，人们纷纷伸出援助之手，汇款或送款到北京台。一位小学生说：我有20元钱，是过春节时爷爷、奶奶给的，原准备攒够了买个小收录机的，先拿出给晓辉姐姐治病吧。28日上午，图中这位住在西坝河年近七旬的老大妈到电台来了，她说：听了广播心里难受，为了救孩子，自己再困难也乐意出一点力。短短四天多时间，已募集到7000多元。
