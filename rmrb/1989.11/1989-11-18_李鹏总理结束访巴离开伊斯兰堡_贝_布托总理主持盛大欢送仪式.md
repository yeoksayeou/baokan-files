Upon arrival at Islamabad International Airport, the welcoming crowd on top of the airport building applauded and cheered. Nearly a thousand female students formed a large-scale dance team on either side of the red carpet, performing gracefully. As the two premiers walked on the red carpet, the crowd lining the path shouted, "Goodbye! Goodbye!" Li Peng bid farewell to each of the officials from the Chinese Embassy, foreign diplomats stationed in Pakistan, Pakistani government cabinet members, military chiefs of staff, Senate chairman, and National Assembly speaker who had come to see him off.

Li Peng expressed his gratitude to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and the Pakistani government and people for their warm and generous hospitality. Benazir Bhutto congratulated Li Peng on the success of his visit to Pakistan and hoped he would visit again. As Li Peng and his wife Zhu Lin boarded the special aircraft, they waved repeatedly to the crowd. Amid the sound of 19 gun salutes, the crowd waved flower bouquets and flags, and the dance team shouted, "Goodbye! Goodbye!"

At 10:20 AM, the special aircraft took off slowly, and Li Peng and his delegation flew to Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, continuing their three-nation tour of South Asia.
