November 15th marked the first anniversary of the declaration of the State of Palestine. One year ago, the Chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, Yasser Arafat, on behalf of the Palestinian people, made a historic decision at the 19th Special Session of the Palestine National Council. He solemnly declared: "On our Palestinian land, we will establish the State of Palestine, with its capital in the glorious city of Jerusalem." Upon its declaration, the State of Palestine was immediately greeted with enthusiastic cheers and heartfelt support from the Palestinian people both inside and outside the occupied territories. It was subsequently recognized and supported by numerous Arab and other countries around the world.

The establishment of the State of Palestine marked a new phase in the Palestinian revolutionary cause. The PLO, as the sole legitimate representative and leadership core of the Palestinian people, has, based on the summation of decades of struggle, adopted a series of pragmatic and flexible policies and practical steps to promote the Middle East peace process. It has united internally, won friends, isolated enemies, and garnered widespread acclaim from the international community, achieving many breakthroughs. The PLO's peace resolution plan has received strong support from the Arab Summit, the Organization of African Unity, the Non-Aligned Movement, and the Islamic Conference. The UN General Assembly meeting on the Palestinian issue, originally scheduled in New York, was forced to move to Geneva, resulting in unprecedented success. The European Community has engaged in dialogue with the PLO, exploring ways to convene an international Middle East peace conference. The United States and the PLO have finally engaged in formal dialogue, taking an important step towards resolving the Middle East issue. The Palestinian Executive Committee held its first meeting in Cairo in 12 years, proposing seven principles for Palestinian-Israeli dialogue, aiming to promote the proposed Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. The correct policies and strategies have enabled the oppressed Palestinian people to gain increasing sympathy and support. Difficulties and obstacles cannot stop the Palestinian people's march forward.

However, the Palestinian issue remains unresolved due to Israel's insistence on aggression and expansion against Palestine. Israel has ignored the existence of the Palestinian people and the PLO, stubbornly opposing just public opinion and the decisions and resolutions of international organizations, including the UN General Assembly. History has proven that the Palestinian people and the PLO cannot be eliminated. Adopting an ostrich policy, turning a blind eye, will ultimately lead to self-destruction. Over the past 41 years, although Israel has temporarily succeeded in military aggression and expansion, it has repeatedly failed politically, morally, and in winning hearts and minds, currently finding itself in an unprecedentedly isolated situation.

A nation that oppresses others is itself not free. The victims of Israel's aggressive and expansionist policies are not only the Palestinian people but also the Arab people and the Israeli people themselves. Therefore, there are many within Israel who oppose the government's current policies.

Aggression and oppression always coexist with resistance and struggle. The uprising of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories has lasted 23 months and is about to enter its third year. This is a great and magnificent act in the history of the Palestinian struggle. This uprising is entirely a result of the Israeli aggressors' long-term oppression. Its duration and impact are deeply rooted. Despite the enormous sacrifices and losses suffered by the Palestinian people, including over 1,000 deaths, 47,000 injuries, 5,600 people beaten and disabled, 63,000 arrests, and the destruction of vast farmlands, olive groves, and homes, the Palestinian people's resolve to fight for national self-determination and independence has only grown stronger. Israel's attempt to use limited elections to gain breathing room and divide the PLO from the people of the occupied territories is futile.

We believe that Israel should face reality, take the initiative, and respond positively to the PLO's peace proposals. Israel must stop suppressing the Palestinian people in the occupied territories and withdraw from the Arab territories occupied in 1967. The legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people must be restored. The State of Israel and the State of Palestine should recognize each other, and through convening a Middle East peace conference, engage in negotiations to achieve a comprehensive and just resolution of the Middle East issue. Only in this way can the Middle East region truly achieve lasting peace and stability.

    务实、灵活政策的胜利
　　谢邦定
    今年11月15日是巴勒斯坦国宣布成立一周年纪念日。
    一年以前，巴解组织执委会主席阿拉法特以巴勒斯坦人民的名义，在作出历史性抉择的巴勒斯坦全国委员会第19次特别会议上庄严宣告：“在我们的巴勒斯坦土地上建立巴勒斯坦国，首都是光荣的耶路撒冷。”巴勒斯坦国一经宣告诞生，立即受到被占领土内外广大巴勒斯坦人民的热烈欢呼和衷心拥戴，先后得到阿拉伯和全世界众多国家的承认和支持。
    巴勒斯坦国的建立，标志着巴勒斯坦革命事业进入了一个新的阶段。巴解组织，作为巴勒斯坦人民唯一合法代表和领导核心，在总结几十年斗争历史经验基础上，近年来进一步采取了一系列务实、灵活的政策和促进中东和平进程的实际步骤，团结内部，争取朋友，孤立敌人，赢得国际社会的广泛赞誉，取得许多突破性的成就。巴解组织提出的和平解决方案，得到阿拉伯首脑紧急会议、非统组织、不结盟国家会议、伊斯兰国家会议的有力支持。联大关于巴勒斯坦问题的会议，从纽约被迫迁到日内瓦召开，结果却是盛况空前。欧洲共同体与巴解组织接触，探索召开中东国际和平会议的途径。美国和巴解组织终于进行正式对话，为中东问题的解决迈出了重要的一步。巴勒斯坦执行委员会12年后第一次在开罗召开，提出巴以对话七原则，力图促进拟议中的巴以谈判。正确的政策和策略，使受侵略和压迫的巴勒斯坦人民日益获得广泛的同情和支持。困难和险阻，阻挡不了巴勒斯坦人民前进的步伐。
    然而，巴勒斯坦问题迄今得不到公正、合理解决，原因在于以色列坚持对巴勒斯坦的侵略、扩张政策。它无视巴勒斯坦人民和巴解组织的存在，顽固对抗公正舆论和包括联大在内的国际组织所作的有关决议和决定。历史已经证明，巴勒斯坦人民和巴解组织是消灭不了的。采取鸵鸟政策，视而不见，到头来也只能是自食恶果。41年来，以色列虽然在军事侵略和扩张上暂时得手，但在政治上、道义上和人心上却接连失败，目前处于空前孤立处境。
    一个压迫其它民族的民族本身是不自由的。受以色列侵略、扩张政策害的不仅是巴勒斯坦人民，阿拉伯人民，也包括以色列人民。因此，在以色列内部反对政府现行政策的大有人在。
    侵略和压迫总是与反抗和斗争共生。被占领土巴勒斯坦人民起义迄今已持续23个月，即将进入第三年。这是巴勒斯坦人民斗争史上伟大的波澜壮阔的义举。这场起义，完全是以色列侵略者多年压迫逼出来的。它能持续这么久，影响这么大，是有深刻原因的。尽管巴勒斯坦人民的生命、财产遭受巨大牺牲和损失，包括1000多人牺牲，47000多人受伤，5600多人遭毒打致残，63000多人被逮捕，大片农田、橄榄树林和住房被毁，但巴勒斯坦人民争取民族自决和国家独立的斗志却越来越高昂。以色列当局妄图用有限选举来取得喘息时间，分化巴解组织同被占领土人民血肉关系是徒劳的。
    我们认为，以色列应当正视现实，采取主动行动，对巴解组织的和平建议作出积极的反应。以色列必须停止对被占领土巴勒斯坦人民的镇压，撤出1967年占领的阿拉伯领土。巴勒斯坦人民的合法民族权利必须恢复。以色列国与巴勒斯坦国应相互承认，通过召开中东和平会议进行谈判，以实现中东问题的全面、公正解决。只有这样，中东地区才能真正实现持久和平与稳定。
