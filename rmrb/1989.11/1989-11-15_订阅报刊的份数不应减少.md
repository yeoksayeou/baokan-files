The number of newspaper and magazine subscriptions should not be reduced. In recent years, due to the increase in the price of paper, printing, publishing, and distribution costs, the subscription fees for newspapers and magazines have also increased accordingly, which is reasonable. However, many units have significantly reduced the number of subscriptions due to the increase in subscription fees, which I believe is inappropriate.

As far as I know, many enterprises and institutions have only one or two local newspapers for a department or team of twenty or thirty people. How can this meet the learning needs of the employees? It is well known that newspapers and magazines are important tools for propagating the Party's line, principles, and policies. They are important channels for conveying the speeches and instructions of central leaders and are the bond between the Party and the masses. If newspapers and magazines are not subscribed to or if the number of subscriptions is greatly reduced, how can the people know about the affairs of the world? How can we talk about caring about national affairs?

Promoting increased production and economizing for a few years is correct, but it should not be understood one-sidedly. What needs to be economized must be economized, and what needs to be spent must still be spent. Education is the foundation, and investment in intelligence cannot be neglected. I hope that party and government leaders at all levels and the heads of enterprises and institutions will pay attention to the work of subscribing to newspapers and magazines and provide employees with sufficient spiritual nourishment.

### 订阅报刊的份数不应减少

    订阅报刊的份数不应减少
    近几年由于纸张价格上涨、印刷出版、传递等费用增大，报刊订费也相对提高，这是合乎情理的。然而，不少单位因报刊订费提高而大大减少订阅份数，我认为这是不妥当的。
    据我所知，不少企事业单位的科室、班组二三十人，只给订一份或两份地方小报，怎么能满足职工学习的需要呢？众所周知，报纸刊物是宣传党的路线、方针、政策的重要工具，是传达中央领导同志讲话、指示的重要途径，是党联系群众的纽带，不予订阅或大减报刊订阅份数，怎么能让人民知道天下事呢，又怎么能谈得上关心国家大事呢？
    提倡增产节支过几年紧日子是对的，但不能片面理解。该节约的一定要节约，该支出的还是应该支出。教育是本，智力投资不可忽视。希望各级党政领导同志和企事业单位的负责人重视报刊订阅工作，给职工提供足够的精神食粮。
