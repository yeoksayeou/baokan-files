People's Daily, Jinan, November 25th - Xinhua News Agency reporters Xie Jing and People's Daily reporter Liu Xiao Yang report: Today, Yanzhou Coal Mine Bureau in Shandong Province had a double celebration: first, they completed the annual national production plan ahead of schedule, exceeding the original coal production target by over 110 million tons; second, the bureau achieved 380 days of safe production, setting a new national record for producing over 1,000 million tons of coal without any fatalities.

The Yanzhou coalfield is located in Zou County, Shandong Province. This area has convenient transportation and abundant coal resources, with exploitable reserves of over 70 billion tons. It is an important base for producing high-quality gas and fat coal in eastern China. Since large-scale construction began in the 1970s, six pairs of production mines have been built, including Xinglongzhuang and Baodian, both of which are mines with an annual production capacity of 300 million tons. The Dongtan coal mine, with an annual production capacity of 400 million tons, is about to start production. The construction of the Jining No. 2 mine, designed with an annual production capacity of 400 million tons, has already begun, and the Jining No. 3 mine, with an annual production capacity of 500 million tons, is undergoing intensive preparatory work. The development and construction of the Yanzhou coalfield play a crucial role in alleviating the coal shortage in the eastern region.

Yanzhou Coal Mine Bureau places great importance on safe production. From the day the mines started operating, they have strictly adhered to quality standards, establishing a comprehensive set of self-protection, operational protection, and fundamental protection regulations. They actively promote and apply modern safety technologies and equipment from both domestic and international sources. Currently, the mechanization rates for fully mechanized mining and tunneling in the entire bureau are 82% and over 95%, respectively. Large mines such as Xinglongzhuang, Baodian, Nantun, and Dongtan have all adopted advanced automated safety monitoring and control systems. Yanzhou Coal Mine Bureau has entered the ranks of the world's leading coal mines in terms of safety production.

　　连续产煤千万吨无死亡
　　兖州矿务局创全国纪录
    本报济南十一月二十五日电　新华社记者谢敬、本报记者刘燮阳报道：今天，山东兖州矿务局双喜临门：一喜，提前完成全年国家生产计划，超产原煤一百一十多万吨；二喜，全局安全生产三百八十一天，首创全国连续产煤超一千万吨无死亡事故新纪录。
    兖州矿区位于山东省邹县，这里交通发达，煤炭资源丰富，可采储量达七十多亿吨，是我国东部主产优质气肥煤的重要基地。它从七十年代大规模建设以来，已建成六对生产矿井，其中有兴隆庄、鲍店两座年产三百万吨的煤矿。年产四百万吨的东滩煤矿即将投产。设计年产四百万吨的济宁二号井已经动工兴建，年产五百万吨的济宁三号井正在进行紧张的前期准备。兖州矿区的开发建设，对于缓和华东地区用煤紧张的状况起着十分重要的作用。
    兖州矿务局在生产建设中，非常重视安全生产，从矿井投产第一天起，就从严从细坚持质量标准化，建立完善了一整套自主保安、业务保安和基础保安规章制度，并积极推广应用国内外现代化的安全技术和装备。目前，全局综采和掘进机械化程度已分别达到百分之八十二和百分之九十五以上，兴隆庄、鲍店、南屯、东滩等大型矿井中，都已采用了先进的自动化安全监测监控装置系统。兖州矿务局已跨入了世界煤矿安全生产的先进行列。
