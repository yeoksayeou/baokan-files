The County Committee of the Communist Youth League in Heilongjiang Province's Hulun has, through the implementation of the "Four-One-One" Science and Technology Project, helped over ten million young people in the county master two to three new technologies, thereby enhancing their ability to get rich.

This "Four-One-One" Science and Technology Project, which began in 1986, involves establishing one high-standard training base in the county, one professional technology association in each township, one science and technology demonstration household in each village, and ensuring that each rural youth masters one practical technology. According to this plan, the county agricultural vocational school serves as the practical technology training base for the County Committee of the Communist Youth League. Over the past three years, it has trained over 2,000 technical cadres. Through multi-channel training, more than 90% of the youth in the county have acquired scientific and technological knowledge.

In implementing the "Four-One-One" Science and Technology Project, the County Committee of the Communist Youth League in Hulun has set specific standards for various science and technology associations, science and technology demonstration households, and the "one person, one skill" initiative.

The implementation of the "Four-One-One" Science and Technology Project has resulted in the emergence of numerous "local experts" and "agricultural scholars" among the rural youth. Fu Jingxing, a science and technology demonstration household in Wailang Village, Shuangjing Township, has boldly explored and successfully applied the "J" brand corn seedling promotion and film covering technology. He actively shared his knowledge with the entire village, expanding from one household to 173 households, and increasing the village's grain production by nearly 70,000 kilograms in one year. Over the past three years, this county has seen the emergence of over 400 rural youth science and technology demonstration households, 22 science and technology associations, and 108 specialized villages.

    团县委实施“四一一科技工程”收效大
    呼兰十余万青年掌握新技术
    本报讯　黑龙江省呼兰团县委，在实施一个叫做“四一一科技工程”的活动中，帮助全县10多万青年掌握了二至三项新技术，增强了致富本领。
    这个从1986年起实施的“四一一科技工程”是，一县一地（县建立一个高标准培训基地），一乡一会（一个乡建立一个专业技术协会），一村一户（一个村培训一个科技示范户），一人一技（每个农村青年掌握一项实用技术）。根据这个计划，县农民中专作为团县委的实用技术培训基地；3年来培训技术骨干2000多人。通过多渠道培训，使全县90％以上的青年学到了科技知识。
    呼兰团县委在实施“四一一科技工程”中，对各类科技协会、科技示范户和“一人一技”，都订有具体标准。
      “四一一科技工程”的开展，使乡村青年中出现了众多“土专家”和“田秀才”。双井乡外郎村科技示范户傅景兴，在实践中大胆摸索，对“吉”字号玉米采用催芽播种，地膜覆盖技术，获得成功。他主动向全村传授，由一户发展到173户，使全村粮食一年增产近7万公斤。3年来，这个县已出现400多个农村青年科技示范户，22个科技协会，108个专业村。
