The outstanding performance of young Chinese women's volleyball player Xu Xin has drawn attention. After the match between China and Peru, reporters requested that Xu Xin attend the post-match press conference.

A reporter asked Hu Jin about the similarities and differences between Xu Xin and Zhang Ruifang. Hu Jin replied that both players are of the same height and play the main attacker position, but their playing styles are different. Xu Xin is 21 years old this year, and at this age, Zhang Ruifang was not playing as well. Through increased training and matches, she has the potential to surpass Zhang Ruifang.

Reporters continued to ask questions, surrounding Xu Xin. It was learned that Xu Xin was born in Shanghai, is 1.74 meters tall, and is currently a second-year student at the Shanghai Institute of Physical Education along with Li Yueling. She joined the national team in January of this year and has received guidance from Zhang Ruifang. Xu Xin hopes to become an outstanding main attacker like Zhang Ruifang.

    她会成为第二个张蓉芳吗？
    中国女排年轻选手许新的出色表现，引起人们的注意。中秘之战结束后，记者们要求许新出席赛后记者招待会。
    有记者问胡进，许新与张蓉芳两人相比，有什么相同点和不同点。胡进回答说，两人身高相同，都打主攻的位置，但打法上各有特点。许新今年21岁，张蓉芳在这个年龄时，没有打得这样好，通过训练和比赛的增加，她有可能超过张蓉芳。
    记者们又提问题“围攻”许新，得知许新出生上海，身高1米74，现在与李月明同是上海体育运动技术学院二年级学生。今年1月进入国家队，曾得到张蓉芳的指教。许新希望自己能像张蓉芳那样成为一名出色的主攻手。晓俞
