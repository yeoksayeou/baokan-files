The joint Chinese-Japanese expedition to climb the main peak of Meri Snow Mountain, Kawagebo Peak, which lasted over a month, has ended in failure. The joint climbing team retreated from the mountain on the 16th. The objective reasons for this failure include harsh weather conditions, complex glaciers, and numerous crevasses that were difficult to cross. Before this, in 1987 and 1988, Japanese and American climbing teams attempted to summit the peak twice but both efforts ended in failure. Kawagebo Peak remains an unclimbed virgin peak.

　　中日联合攀登梅里雪山失利
    本报昆明十一月二十日电　历时一月有余的中日联合攀登梅里雪山主峰卡瓦格博峰已告失利，联合登山队于十六日撤营下山。这次登山失利的客观原因是气候恶劣，山体冰川复杂，冰缝纵横难以逾越。在此之前的一九八七年和一九八八年，日本和美国的登山队两次攀登均告失败。卡瓦格博峰仍然是一座处女峰。（钱江）
