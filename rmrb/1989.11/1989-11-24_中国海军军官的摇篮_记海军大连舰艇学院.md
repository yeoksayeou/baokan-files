Today, November 22nd, marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Naval Dalian Naval Academy, renowned as the "Cradle of Chinese Naval Officers."

After 40 years of development, the Naval Dalian Naval Academy has trained over 12,000 naval officers for the Chinese Navy. Currently, nearly 5,000 of them are still in active service, including 23 generals, 1,325 colonels, and 300 commanders of third-level or higher naval vessels. Almost all the department heads of third-level or higher surface vessels in the Navy are graduates of this academy. Among them are Major General Qu Zhenmou, the deputy commander of a certain fleet; Major General Chen Weifen, who has led five major naval battles and received a second-class merit citation; Major General Zhao Guochen, who commanded the first Chinese expedition to the South Pole and is now the commander of a certain base; and Colonel Zhang Yunqi, who participated in the self-defense counterattack in the Paracel Islands and received a first-class merit citation. There is also Lieutenant Yang Zhiliang, who graduated from the academy and participated in the 1988 battle to defend the Spratly Islands, receiving a first-class merit citation. Now, these graduates are spread throughout the Navy's mid- and high-level leadership, covering 18,000 kilometers of coastline and over 300,000 square kilometers of maritime territory, forming the backbone of the People's Navy.

The Naval Dalian Naval Academy has a leadership team that is proficient in naval expertise, experienced in education, and full of energy. It also has a large team of faculty members engaged in scientific research and teaching. The academy has a modernized curriculum system that is deeply rooted in research and continuously enriched with new achievements. It possesses a number of high-tech results that are leading in the world, a comprehensive simulation training system for surface vessels that can simulate an entire naval battle on land, a high-tech naval tactics software center that is advanced in the world, a 5,400-ton modernized ocean-going training vessel named "Zheng He," and a large standardized indoor swimming pool for year-round water sports training.

The faculty of the Naval Dalian Naval Academy has grown from 25 members in its early days to 544 today. Among them, 164 are professors, associate professors, senior engineers, and senior experimentalists, and 75 have been awarded the rank of senior colonel. From 1978 to 1988, the academy undertook over 260 national and military key scientific and technological projects, completing more than 200 of them. Over 50 of these research achievements filled gaps in China's technological capabilities and won national and military scientific and technological progress awards. More than 120 new research results have been incorporated into the curriculum, meeting the teaching needs of modernized naval equipment. Over 80 research results have been widely promoted and used in the troops, enhancing their combat effectiveness.

Since 1950, the Naval Dalian Naval Academy has represented the Navy in 11 national day military parades in the capital, earning the honor of "Best Reviewing Unit." A member of a foreign military delegation said: The academic and educational standards of the Naval Dalian Naval Academy are first-class.

    今年11月22日，是以“中国海军军官的摇篮”闻名于世的海军大连舰艇学院成立40周年纪念日。
    经过40年建设的海军大连舰艇学院，已为海军培养出了1.2万多名军官，目前服现役的有近5000人，其中有将军23名，校官1325名，担任海军3级舰以上舰艇长的有300人，海军3级舰以上水面舰艇的部门长，几乎都是这所学院培养出去的。在他们当中，有担任某舰队副司令员的曲振牟中将；有5次指挥过重大海战荣立二等功的陈伟文少将，有指挥过我国首次赴南极考察队的副总指挥，现任某基地司令员赵国臣少将，也有参加过西沙自卫还击战荣立一等功的张云卿上校；还有从学院刚刚毕业就参加了1988年保卫南沙海战荣立一等功的杨志亮上尉。现在，这批学员已遍及海军中、高级干部层，分布在1.8万多公里的海岸线和300多平方公里的海洋国土上，已成为人民海军中的中坚力量。
    大连舰艇学院有一支精通海军专业、办学经验丰富、年富力强的领导班子，有一支庞大的从事科研、教学的教员队伍，有一个深深扎根在科研中，不断用新成果充实的现代化教材体系，有一批在世界上属于领先水平的高科技成果，有一整套可供学员在陆地上模拟出整个海战的具有世界先进水平的水面舰艇综合模拟训练系统，有一座具有世界先进水平的高科技海军战术软件中心，有一艘排水量为5400吨的“郑和”号现代化远洋训练舰，还有一座可供学员一年四季完成水上体育训练科目的大型标准化室内游泳馆。
    大连舰艇学院的教员队伍，已从初创时期的25名发展到今天的544名。其中有164名正副教授、高级工程师、实验师，被授予大校军衔的75名。从1978年到1988年的10年间，学院接受国家、军队重点科技项目260多项，已完成了200多项。其中有50多个科研成果填补了我国空白，并获得了全国科技进步奖、全军科技成果奖。有120多项科研新成果已充实到教材中去，适应了海军现代化装备的教学需要。已有80多项科研成果在部队广泛推广使用，提高了部队战斗力。
    自1950年以来，大连舰艇学院曾代表海军参加过11次首都国庆阅兵，曾荣获“受阅方队第一名”的光荣称号。一位外国军事代表团成员说：大连舰艇学院的办学水平和学术水平是一流的。
