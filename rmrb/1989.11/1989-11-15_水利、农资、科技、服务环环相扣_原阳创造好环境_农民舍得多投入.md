People's Daily, Zhengzhou, November 14th — Reporter Li Erliang reports: Over the past few years, Yuan Yang County in Henan Province has been committed to continuously improving the agricultural investment environment, attracting farmers to invest more, and laying a solid foundation for the county's continuous increase in grain production.

Yuan Yang County is an agricultural county along the Yellow River. In the past few years, the voices of the people have reflected such problems: without a favorable environment, even if one wants to invest more, it may not be possible to achieve results. For example, to implement Yellow River irrigation, individual villages cannot achieve much; to apply more fertilizer to the fields, there is a shortage of fertilizers and it is difficult to purchase; to improve grain yield, it is unclear where to find good seeds and technology, etc. The county leadership, in response to these problems, has clearly defined the guiding ideology and striven to create a favorable environment for collective and public investment in various links of agricultural production. Their specific measures are:

— Water Conservancy Construction Investment. Every year, large-scale agricultural water conservancy construction is planned and organized, with the main canals and branch canals jointly funded by the state and the public, with the state taking the lead. The branch canals, farm canals, and small canals are funded by the public, and the county, township, and village organizations plan and implement them. Statistics show that in recent years, in addition to labor, the public has invested an average of more than 5 million yuan in water conservancy construction each year.

— Agricultural Resource Investment. The county has invested in the expansion of two fertilizer plants, increasing the annual fertilizer production capacity to 110,000 tons. In terms of sales, the number of intermediaries has been reduced, and the sales are directly managed by the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, supplying directly to the farmers.

— Scientific and Technological Investment. Throughout the county, various levels of leaders have demonstration fields, various levels of scientific and technological personnel have experimental fields, and each township and village has high-yield demonstration fields, forming a microclimate that influences farmers. Agricultural scientific and technological personnel actively sign contracts with farmers, with the profits from high yields belonging to the farmers, and the state compensating for any losses, stimulating farmers to confidently invest in science and technology.

— Service Investment. The county has established an agricultural service center, and each township has improved the agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and electricity service systems. The service network is distributed to each village and group, and as long as the farmers need it, they can get timely service.

    水利、农资、科技、服务环环相扣
    原阳创造好环境  农民舍得多投入
    本报郑州11月14日电　记者李而亮报道：河南省原阳县近几年致力于农业投入环境的不断改善，吸引农民舍得投入、多投入，为全县粮食连年增产打下了坚实基础。
    原阳县是黄河边上的农业县，前几年群众的呼声中反映出这样的问题：没有一个有利的环境，想多投入也不一定能办成事。例如要引黄灌溉，独村独户成不了气候；要往地里多追肥，化肥紧张难买到；想提高粮食产量，良种技术不知往哪里寻等等。县领导针对这些问题，明确指导思想，努力在农业生产的各个环节上创造出一个有利于吸引集体和群众投入的良好环境。他们的具体措施是：
    ——水利建设投入。每年规划组织大规模的农田水利建设，规定总渠、干渠由国家和群众共同负担，以国家为主。支渠、农渠、毛渠则由群众自己负担，县乡村组织规划实施。据统计，近几年，全县群众除投工外，平均每年向水利建设投资达500多万元。
    ——农资投入。县里投资扩建了两个化肥厂，使全县化肥年产量达11万吨。在购销上减少中间环节，专营到基层供销社，直供到农户。
    ——科技投入。在全县范围内，各级领导有指挥田，各级科技人员有试验田，各乡村有高产样板田，形成了影响农户的小气候。农业科技人员积极与农户订立承包合同，丰产归农户，损失国家补，刺激了农民放心在科技上投入。
    ——服务投入。县里建立了农业服务中心，各乡健全农、林、牧、电等服务体系，服务网络分布到各个村组，只要农户需要，都得到及时服务。
