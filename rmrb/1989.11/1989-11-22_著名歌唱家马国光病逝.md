Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 21st.

Renowned singer Ma Guoguang passed away today. Ma Guoguang, a first-level performer with the Beijing Military Region's War Friendship Troupe, was known as the "Soldier Singer." He passed away due to illness in the early hours of today in Beijing at the age of 57.

Ma Guoguang was a famous male mezzo-soprano singer. In his early years, he was separated from his family and wandered, enduring much hardship. In early 1949, he joined the People's Liberation Army of China. The Party gave him the warmth of a mother, nurturing him from a wandering child into a singer. For decades, his voice echoed through the trenches of the Korean War, the battlefields of Tibet, and the border outposts of the motherland. His singing was passionate and exuberant, humorous and witty, mostly reflecting the military camp and soldiers with whom he spent his days. In the 1950s, he became famous with the song "It's Really Funny." His performances of "I Am a Soldier," "Two Buddies of the Same Height," "Me and the Platoon Leader," "A Jug of Water," and selections from "The Long March Suite" were also deeply loved by the broad masses of soldiers. In his later years, his songs included "I Am the Company Photographer" and "The Motherland Will Be Beautiful Tomorrow."

　　著名歌唱家马国光病逝
    新华社北京11月21日电　（记者陈辉）享有战士歌唱家美名的北京军区战友文工团一级演员马国光，因病于今日凌晨在北京逝世，享年57岁。
    马国光是著名男中音歌唱家，他幼年与家人失散四处流浪，受尽人间苦楚。1949年初参加中国人民解放军，党给了他母亲般的温暖，把他从一个流浪儿培养成为歌唱家。几十年来，他的歌声响彻抗美援朝的战壕、西藏平叛的沙场、祖国的边防哨卡。他的歌声热情奔放，幽默风趣，大都反映与他朝夕相处的军营和士兵。50年代他因一曲《真是乐死人》而成名。他演唱的《我是一个兵》、《两个小伙一般高》、《我和班长》、《一壶水》、《长征组歌》选曲等，也深受广大官兵的喜爱。他晚年演唱的歌曲主要有《我是连队摄影家》、《祖国明天多美好》等。
