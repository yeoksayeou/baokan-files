Jiang Zemin Meets with Representatives of the National Women's Federation Executive Committee
Hopes Women Will Fully Utilize Their Strengths to Contribute to Rectification and Deepening of Reform

BEIJING, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) — General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Jiang Zemin said today at a meeting with representatives of the Sixth National Women's Congress Executive Committee that women are a great force driving social development. The success of the Chinese revolution would not have been possible without women, and the success of China's socialist modernization, rectification, and deepening of reform is also inseparable from women.

Accompanied by Kang Keqing and Chen Muhua, Jiang Zemin and other leaders, including Qiao Shi, Song Ping, Ding Guan'gen, Hab Zibin, Lei Jieqing, Deng Zhaoxiang, met with all the executive committee members attending the Sixth National Women's Congress Executive Committee in the afternoon at the Great Hall of the People. He also held a discussion with some of the representatives.

The meeting was chaired by Chen Muhua, Chairperson of the All-China Women's Federation. Representatives from various provinces and cities, including Shandong, Anhui, Jiangxi, Gansu, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Jiangsu, Nanjing, Shenyang, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and Jilin, spoke at the meeting.

They introduced the important role women have played in the construction of socialist material and spiritual civilization. They believed that in the past year, the All-China Women's Federation and local women's federations, focusing on the central task of rectification and deepening of reform, have played an active role in leading women to participate in socialist reform and construction. The construction of women's federations has also been strengthened.

The representatives also discussed expanding the scope of women's work, women's participation in politics, training female cadres, strengthening women's education, solving problems for female workers, and protecting the rights of women and children. They criticized gender discrimination in society and called for creating a good environment and conditions for women's progress and development.

Jiang Zemin fully affirmed the achievements of women's work in the past decade. He said that since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the women's federations have united and led women of all ethnic groups to make important contributions to the development of construction and reform, and to the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Women have broken through various prejudices, liberated their minds, stood on their own feet, and worked hard to achieve progress in economic construction and reform and opening up; in promoting education, health, science, and culture; in advocating a civilized, healthy, and scientific way of life, creating harmonious and happy families, and implementing family planning; and in maintaining stability and unity, especially in this year's efforts to stop the turmoil, suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and stabilize the situation, women have played an important role. Many outstanding women have emerged in various fields, fully demonstrating the wisdom and strength of Chinese women.

Jiang Zemin said that Chinese women are known for their hard work, intelligence, and perseverance, and have a fine tradition of hard struggle. He hoped that in the process of rectification and deepening of reform, women would fully utilize their strengths. He said that the women's federations at all levels should guide women to seriously study and implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, correctly understand the current economic situation, mobilize women to launch the "double increase, double saving" campaign, strive to develop production, continuously improve economic benefits, and overcome the current economic difficulties. Women's federations at all levels should create more and better forms of activities around the tasks of further rectification and deepening of reform, and hope to produce more and more "March 8th Red Banner Holders," outstanding women, and models among women, to show the spirit of Chinese women and bring glory to the socialist system.

Jiang Zemin pointed out that rectification and deepening of reform require a stable and harmonious social environment, and we must strengthen the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. He said that women are not only an important force in economic construction and reform and opening up, but also an important force in the construction of spiritual civilization. Women's federations should organize women and bring out their active role. It is necessary to greatly improve the quality of women, raise their ideological and political awareness and scientific and cultural level. Currently, it is necessary to vigorously carry out the campaign to change customs and advocate a civilized, healthy, and scientific way of life, promote socialist and communist moral norms, and resolutely fight against all decadent thoughts and evil phenomena, and protect the legitimate rights of women and children.

Jiang Zemin also called on women to advocate the new trend of thrift and frugality, and to do a good job in family planning. He said that women's federations should educate and guide women to be thrifty and frugal, oppose blind comparison, eliminate waste, actively participate in savings, and support national construction. Women's federations should cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job in family planning, repeatedly and patiently explain the importance of family planning and national policies to women, implement various family planning measures, and strive to reduce the natural growth rate of the population.

He said that doing a good job in family planning is a great contribution to the country and the people.

Jiang Zemin proposed that women's federations at all levels should focus on the grassroots level, focus on implementation, and widely publicize the deeds of advanced and model women, use typical examples to set examples, promote the understanding of the great role of Chinese women by all sectors of society, and promote various aspects to care for and support the work of women's federations.

He said that women's federations are mass organizations under the leadership of the Party. Party committees at all levels should strengthen the leadership of women's federations, pay more attention to and study the work of women's federations, support women's participation in politics, support women's federations to do practical things for women, and pay attention to the training and appointment of women's federation cadres, helping women's federations to build a revolutionary, young, knowledgeable, and professional cadre team.

Qiao Shi, Song Ping, and Ding Guan'gen also spoke at the meeting.

Vice Chairpersons of the All-China Women's Federation Zhang Zhaoying, Huang Qixian, Apu Cairenqie, Maijinu'er Hasimu, Zhang Suwei, Nie Li, and Secretary-General of the Standing Committee Wang Shuxian, Guan Tao, and Kang Long also attended the meeting and discussion.

    新华社北京11月15日电  （记者邹爱国、胡晓梦）中共中央总书记江泽民今天在与全国妇联六届二次执委会代表座谈时说，妇女是推动社会发展的伟大力量。中国革命的成功离不开妇女，中国社会主义现代化建设和治理整顿、深化改革的成功同样也离不开妇女。
    在康克清、陈慕华的陪同下，江泽民和乔石、宋平、丁关根、习仲勋、雷洁琼、邓兆祥等同志下午在人民大会堂会见了出席全国妇联六届二次执委会的全体执委，并和部分执委进行了座谈。

    她们在发言中介绍了广大妇女在社会主义物质文明和精神文明建设中发挥的重要作用。她们认为，一年来全国妇联和各级妇联围绕治理整顿、深化改革这一中心工作，发挥妇联组织的教育、参与、代表、服务、联谊职能，在带领广大妇女群众投身社会主义改革和建设事业等方面作出了积极的努力，妇联组织的自身建设也得到进一步加强。

    江泽民在讲话中充分肯定了近十年来我国妇女工作的成绩。他说，党的十一届三中全会以来，妇联组织团结和带领各族各界妇女，为推动建设和改革事业的发展，为建设有中国特色的社会主义，作出了重要贡献。广大妇女冲破种种世俗的偏见，解放思想，自立自强，奋发进取，在经济建设和改革开放中；在繁荣教育、卫生、科学、文化事业方面；在倡导文明健康科学的生活方式，创造和睦幸福的家庭，实行计划生育方面；在维护安定团结方面，特别是在今年制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱，稳定局势中，都发挥了重要作用。各条战线涌现出大批有胆有识、精明强干、出类拔萃的妇女人才，充分显示了中国妇女的聪明才智和伟大力量。
    江泽民说，中国妇女以勤劳智慧、吃苦耐劳而著称于世，历来就有艰苦奋斗的优良传统。他希望在治理整顿和深化改革中充分发挥妇女群众的优势。他说，各级妇联组织当前要引导广大妇女认真学习贯彻党的十三届五中全会精神，正确认识当前的经济形势，把广大妇女动员起来，广泛开展“双增双节”运动，努力发展生产，不断提高经济效益，克服目前的经济困难。各级妇联组织要围绕进一步治理整顿和深化改革的任务，创造更多更好的活动形式，希望在广大妇女中产生出越来越多的三八红旗手、女能人、女模范，产生出各种各样的先进人物，为中国妇女争气，为社会主义制度争光。
    江泽民提出，治理整顿和深化改革需要一个稳定、和谐的社会环境，我们必须大力加强社会主义精神文明建设。他说，广大妇女不仅是经济建设、改革开放的一支重要力量，而且是精神文明建设的一支重要力量，妇联组织应当把妇女群众组织起来，把她们的积极作用发挥出来。要大力提高广大妇女自身的素质，提高她们思想政治觉悟和科学文化水平。目前要大力开展移风易俗活动，提倡文明健康科学的生活方式，发扬社会主义、共产主义的道德风尚，同各种腐朽思想和一切丑恶现象进行坚决的斗争，维护妇女儿童的合法权益。
    江泽民在讲话中要求广大妇女提倡勤俭持家、节俭为荣的新风尚，认真做好计划生育工作。他说，妇联组织应当教育和引导广大妇女勤俭持家，反对盲目攀比，杜绝铺张浪费，积极参加储蓄，支援国家建设。妇联组织要配合有关部门做好计划生育工作，应当反复、耐心地向广大妇女宣传计划生育的重要意义和国家的有关政策，落实各项计划生育的措施，努力降低人口的自然增长率。
    他说，把计划生育工作做好了，就是对国家和人民立了大功。
    江泽民提出，各级妇联要狠抓基层，狠抓落实，多宣传先进、模范妇女的事迹，通过典型引路，树立榜样，促使社会各界了解中国妇女的伟大作用，促使各方面重视和支持妇联的工作。
