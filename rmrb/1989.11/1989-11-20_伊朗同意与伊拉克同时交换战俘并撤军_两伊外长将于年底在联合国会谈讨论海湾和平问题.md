Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, November 16th.

Iran agrees to simultaneous exchange of prisoners of war and withdrawal of troops with Iraq. The foreign ministers of the two countries will meet at the end of the year in the United Nations to discuss Gulf peace issues.

Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati today announced that Iran agrees to a simultaneous exchange of prisoners of war and withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized borders with Iraq.

After the final round of talks with UN Special Envoy Diego Cordovez, Velayati made this announcement.

The withdrawal of troops and exchange of prisoners of war are two fundamental goals of UN Resolution 598. Resolution 598 led to a ceasefire between the two countries in August 1988 and is widely regarded as the basis for restoring peace in the Gulf.

However, Iraq insists on the exchange of prisoners of war as the first step towards peace, while Iran has repeatedly demanded that Iraq withdraw its troops from more than 2,000 square kilometers of Iranian territory first.

Over the past two weeks, Cordovez has conducted a series of diplomatic shuttle visits between Baghdad and Tehran. According to the Iranian News Agency, Iran has accepted Cordovez's proposal for an immediate withdrawal of troops and exchange of prisoners of war.

It is also reported that UN Special Envoy Cordovez announced today that the foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq will hold talks in New York at the end of December, with the participation of UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, to discuss Gulf peace issues.

    伊朗同意与伊拉克同时交换战俘并撤军
    两伊外长将于年底在联合国会谈讨论海湾和平问题
    新华社德黑兰11月16日电  伊朗外长韦拉亚提今天表示，伊朗同意与伊拉克同时交换战俘和撤军至国际承认的边界以内。
    在与联合国特使伊莱亚森进行最后一轮会谈后，韦拉亚提宣布了这一决定。
    撤军和交换战俘是联合国598号决议的两个基本目标。598号决议使两伊在1988年8月实现了停火，被广泛认为是恢复海湾和平的基础。
    但是，伊拉克坚持首先交换战俘，作为实现和平的第一步；而伊朗一再要求，伊拉克必须首先从2000多平方公里的伊朗领土上撤走军队。
    在过去两周里，伊莱亚森在巴格达和德黑兰之间进行了一系列外交穿梭。据伊朗通讯社报道，伊朗接受了伊莱亚森关于立即进行撤军和交换战俘的建议。
    另据报道，联合国特使伊莱亚森今天宣布，伊朗和伊拉克外长将在12月底在纽约举行有联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔参加的会谈，讨论海湾和平问题。
