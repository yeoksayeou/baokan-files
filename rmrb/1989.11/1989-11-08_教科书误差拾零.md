Title: Minor Errors in Textbooks

There are numerous errors in the primary and secondary school textbooks published this spring.

In the second volume of the "Mathematics" textbook for first-grade primary school students published by the Sichuan Science and Technology Press, on page 22, there is a problem: "A full box of chalk has 50 pieces. The first time 12 pieces are taken out, and the second time 39 pieces are taken out. How many pieces are left in the box?" First-grade students do not understand negative numbers.

In the first volume of the senior high school Chinese language textbook published by the People's Education Press, in the fifteenth lesson "Mr. Zhu Ziqing," the annotation states: "Zhu Ziqing (1908-1948) was from Donghai County, Jiangsu Province." However, in the twentieth lesson, in the "Pre-reading Guide" for Zhu Ziqing's "Two Essays," it says: "《Green》 was written in 1924. At that time, the author was only 26 years old." According to this calculation, Zhu Ziqing should have been born in 1898 (which is actually the case). According to the "Concise Literary Handbook," Zhu Ziqing was not from Donghai County, Jiangsu Province, but from Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province.

Textbooks should not have any errors. Those who compile and publish books for the younger generation must have a strong sense of responsibility and dedication to their work.

    教科书误差拾零
    在今春发行的中小学教科书中，错误比比皆是。
    四川科学技术出版社出版的小学一年级小学学习目标与形成性测验《数学》第二册22页有这样一道题：“一满盒粉笔共有50支，第一次取出12支，第二次取出39支。盒里还有多少支？”一年级学生哪懂负数？
    人民教育出版社出版的高中语文课本第一册第十五课《朱自清先生》的注释写道：“朱自清（1908—1948）江苏省东海县人。”但在该课本第二十课，朱自清的《散文二篇》的《预习提示》中又说：“《绿》写于1924年。当时作者年仅26岁。”按这种说法推算，朱自清应生于1898年（事实上也是）。根据《简明文学手册》，朱自清并非江苏东海县人，而是江苏扬州人。
    教科书是决不应出一点差错的，作为为青少年一代编书、出书的同志，要有高度的事业心和责任感。
