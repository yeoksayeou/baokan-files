Shanghai's 14 key industrial projects have made encouraging progress: color picture tubes and color film will produce qualified trial production products by the end of this year. The domestication rate of Santana sedans and DF-300 cameras is expected to reach 50%, and the installation of 6 production lines for multifunctional composite coated fabrics is being accelerated, with 10 million meters of fabric to be released to the market this year. Mayor Zhu Rongji recently said at an experience exchange meeting on the battle that the key to overcoming current difficulties is to rely on the integration of technology and production to produce high-quality products and enter the international market.

A year and a half ago, after Zhu Rongji took office as the mayor of Shanghai, he immediately organized the 14 key industrial projects to explore new paths for the integration of technology and production. After two public tenders, a total of 350 key scientific and technological projects were arranged, with more than 3,000 scientific and technological personnel from the entire city participating in the battle and entering the main battlefield of economic construction.

During the battle, the integration of technology and production has presented a new situation. Factories and enterprises rely on research institutions to do their best to provide good research conditions for research institutions; research institutions spare no effort to participate in the battle, package the results, and ensure that the results are quickly transformed into productive forces, replace imports, expand exports, and improve economic benefits. The "20 Megabyte 3.5 Inch Floppy Disk Drive" project team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences East China Computer Institute always kept industrialization in mind during the battle. They started from domestication and domestic matching in the design of the sample machine, the development of components, and the selection of materials, closely cooperated with the production unit, and laid the foundation for quickly forming batch production capacity. The "Industrial Control Microcomputer Application" project team of the Shanghai Computer Institute closely linked research with promotion and application in production. Currently, this project has been applied in more than 30 enterprises and has begun to produce significant economic benefits.

    依靠科技与生产结合的优势战胜困难
    上海工业项目会战进展可喜
    本报上海电　记者萧关根报道：上海14项重点工业项目会战取得可喜进展：彩色显像管和彩色胶卷今年年底将出合格的试生产产品，桑塔纳轿车和DF—300照相机国产化率达到50％的目标已经在望，多功能复合涂层织物的6条生产线正在加紧安装，1000万米织物年内投放市场。朱熔基市长最近在会战经验交流会上说，战胜当前困难的关键是依靠科技与生产的结合，生产出高质量的产品进入国际市场。
    一年半以前，朱熔基出任上海市长之后即着手组织14项重点工业项目会战，探索科技与生产结合的新路子。经过两次公开招标，共安排了350项科技攻关项目，全市有3000多名科技人员参加攻关，进入经济建设主战场。
    会战中，科技与生产结合出现了新的局面，工厂企业依靠科研单位，千方百计为科研单位提供良好的科研条件；科研单位全力以赴参加攻关，包出成果，并保证把成果迅速地转化为生产力，顶替进口，扩大出口，提高经济效益。中科院华东计算所的“20兆3.5英寸温盘驱动器”课题组，在攻关过程中始终把产业化放在心中。他们在样机的造型、零部件的研制和材料的选择上，从国产化和国内配套着手，和生产单位密切配合，为迅速形成批量生产能力奠定了基础。上海计算所“工业控制微机应用”课题组把科研同生产中的推广应用紧紧挂钩。目前，这一项目已在30多家企业应用，开始产生较大的经济效益。
