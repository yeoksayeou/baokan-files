	Beauty in Jiuquan
	—Notes from the "Hexi Four Counties" Interview, Part II
	People's Daily reporter Zhang Shusheng, Xinhua News Agency reporter Cao Yong'an

	Over 50 years ago, the famous journalist Fan Changjiang came to Jiuquan on the eve of the Lunar New Year. He wrote, "Despite being the New Year, beggar children under the age of 10, with no clothes and covered in dirt, could be seen everywhere on the streets. In a few wind-protected alleys, the reporter did not dare to pass by at night." The following text describes the miserable cries of the hungry and cold, making readers' eyes well up with tears.

	Coincidentally, this time the reporter also arrived in Jiuquan by car at night. The streets were filled with lights and people, the cries of vendors selling fruits and snacks in front of the theater, and the music from the music tea house, all blended into the thick night, creating a harmonious and warm atmosphere.

	Following the music, the reporter was drawn to the dancing couples in the dance hall of the Jiuquan Hotel. Upon inquiring with the staff, it was learned that most of the dancers were local residents of Jiuquan, with a dance ticket costing 2.5 yuan, and every session was packed. Looking at their attire and dance moves, they were no different from those in Beijing or Shanghai.

	The next day, the reporter strolled around Jiuquan City. The newly heard folk saying, "Potatoes blooming like peonies, urban and rural girls indistinguishable," was immediately confirmed on the streets. The pedestrians were dressed neatly and in a variety of colors. Especially the girls' skirts, in various hues, blended with the blooming cosmos and morning glories on both sides of the street, making the long street look like a gallery, giving people an endless sense of beauty. It was not easy to distinguish the rural girls among them. Just seven or eight years ago, rural girls coming to the city could be easily spotted because they almost always wore a large red or green headscarf. Now, even rural boys coming to the city for work are not like tigers coming down the mountain—just a skin. They all have work clothes hanging on the back of their bicycles.

	Jiuquan City is the wealthiest county in Gansu Province. Last year, the per capita net income here reached 811 yuan. During this visit to Jiuquan, we heard a story. A Jiuquan entrepreneur went to a financial institution in Beijing to apply for a $1.5 million loan. All the procedures were in order, but the other party, hearing that he was from the Hexi Corridor in Gansu, was a bit worried about the desolation of the place. During the defense meeting, the other party asked, "Do you have foreigners there?" "Ridiculous!" This Hexi man was provoked: "The majority of Japanese tourists coming to Beijing want to go to our Jiuquan! The ancient Silk Road has been revived, and the famous poem 'Grape wine in the nightlight cup,' the nightlight cup is from our Jiuquan." Now, "the largest airport in Asia is also in Jiuquan." Later, the loan was approved, and the business was successful. When we visited this entrepreneur, he said, "Ten years ago, I would have been nervous even going to Lanzhou, let alone Beijing! Now that Jiuquan is prosperous, I am representing Jiuquan to do business, how can I not be bold!"

　　美在酒泉
　　——“河西四郡”采访札记之二
　　本报记者　张述圣　新华社记者　曹永安
    50余年前，著名记者范长江曾在农历除夕之夜来到酒泉。他在记述其境遇时写道：“尽管是新年时候，街上随处可以看到10岁以下无衣褂全身灰泥的乞丐儿童。有几条背风的街道，记者简直在晚间没有勇气经过。”后文便是饥寒者哀嚎的惨状，令读者泪眼模糊。
    凑巧，记者这次也是夜间驱车赶到酒泉。满街的灯火、人流，剧院门前卖瓜果及炒货的吆喝声，音乐茶座的乐曲声，交织在浓浓的夜色中，是那般的和谐温馨。
    循着音乐，酒泉宾馆舞厅里翩翩起舞的男女青年吸引了记者。向服务员打听方知，舞者多数是酒泉居民，一张舞票2元5角，场场爆满。再看看他们的衣着、舞姿，与北京、上海无异。
    翌日，记者在酒泉城里徜徉，刚听到的“洋芋开花赛牡丹，城乡姑娘分不清”的新民谚，立时在街头得到证实。行人的穿戴整洁，花色繁多。尤其是姑娘们的裙裾，五颜六色，同街道两旁盛开的波斯菊、牵牛花相映在一起，长街俨然画廊似的，给人一种无限的美感。要在她们中间去辨农家女确非易事。七八年前，农家姑娘进城一眼能看出来，因为她们头上几乎四季都顶着一块大红大绿的方巾。如今，就连进城干活的农村小伙，也不是老虎下山——一张皮了，他们自行车的后衣架上都带着工作服。
    酒泉市是甘肃省的首富之乡，去年这里的人均纯收入已达811元。这次在酒泉听到一个故事。酒泉一位企业家到北京一家金融机构去申请150万美元的贷款，一切手续都齐备了，但对方因他是从甘肃河西走廊来的，听说那地方荒凉得很，有点不放心。答辩会上对方问：“你们那里有外宾吗？”“笑话！”这位河西大汉被激了起来：“来北京的日本游客，他们中的大多数是要去我们酒泉的！古丝绸之路复苏了，唐诗名句‘葡萄美酒夜光杯’，夜光杯就出在咱酒泉。”如今，“亚洲最大的机场也在酒泉。”后来贷款拿到手了，事业办成了。当我们拜访这位企业家时，他说：“这在10年前，别说北京，就是去兰州我也怯场呀！如今酒泉富裕起来了，我是代表酒泉办事业的，胆子怎个不壮！”
    如果范长江在世，今日酒泉在他笔下不知该有多美呢！
