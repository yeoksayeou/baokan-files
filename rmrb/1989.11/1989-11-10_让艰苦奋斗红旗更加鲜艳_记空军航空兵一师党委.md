The Party Committee of the First Aviation Brigade of the Air Force, known for its motto "Learning leads the way, working with all one's might, living simply, and setting an example in discipline," has continued and carried forward the fine tradition of hard struggle. They govern with integrity, maintain self-discipline, and lead the troops in building and developing, making the red flag of hard struggle even brighter.

Today, the main leaders of the brigade's Party Committee have changed four times, but the fine tradition of hard struggle has been consistently carried on. In the new situation of reform and opening up, the Party Committee has formulated "Ten No's" to avoid special treatment, as an important part of clean governance, and has made it public to accept supervision from the masses.

A prominent feature of the Party Committee's clean governance is living simply. When allocating housing, they prioritize aircrew over ground crew, and the brigade over leaders. The newest dormitories in the camp are occupied by 60 young pilots, and some of the maintenance personnel's living conditions are among the best in the Air Force. However, most of the members of the Party Committee still live in old houses from the 1940s. When visiting units, they eat the same meals as the officers and soldiers and do not accept any special treatment. For personal use of vehicles, they insist on paying the mileage fee. Even the members of the Party Committee who are aircrew personnel eat the same meals as ordinary pilots during holidays, receiving the same food rations.

When faced with improper winds, the Party Committee often encounters comparisons in the pursuit of enjoyment and phenomena such as officers and soldiers asking for favors for transfers, demobilization, meritorious deeds, party membership, study, promotion, etc. Their strategy is to refuse gifts and not attend banquets, and they have set this rule for their families. They do not accept gifts from subordinates and do not make "contributions" to superiors. The officers and soldiers praise the Party Committee for being "self-reflective in situations where one might be excused and self-disciplined where there is no supervision."

    Preparing, soaring to the clouds.

    让艰苦奋斗红旗更加鲜艳
    ——记空军航空兵一师党委
    曾以“学习走在前，工作拚命干，生活不特殊，遵纪做模范”而闻名的空军航空兵一师党委，继承和发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，为政清廉，洁身自律，带领部队建设发展，使艰苦奋斗的红旗更加鲜艳。
    如今，师党委的主要领导成员已经换了4茬，艰苦奋斗的好传统却一如既往地继承了下来。在改革开放的新形势下，党委议订出了不搞特殊化的“十个不准”，作为廉政建设的重要内容，公布于众，接受群众监督。
    空一师党委廉政建设的一个显著特点是生活不特殊。分配住房，做到先空勤后地勤，先部队后领导；营区最新的宿舍，居住着60户年轻飞行员，部分机务人员的居住条件在空军也堪称第一流，而师党委常委们大多仍住在40年代的旧房里。下部队，他们同干部战士吃一样的饭菜，不接受任何照顾；私人用车，他们坚持交纳车公里费；就连身为空勤干部的师党委成员节假日回家就餐，也和普通飞行员一样，凭票领取同样的食品。
    当不正之风袭来时，党委“一班人”经常遇到的是追求享受的攀比，是干部战士为调动、转业、立功、入党、送学、提升等请客送礼现象。他们的对策是送礼不收，吃请不到，而且都对自己的家属立了这条规矩。他们不接收部属的礼品，也从不向上级“进贡”。官兵们称赞师党委是“在有情可原中自省，在无人监督处自律”。　孙茂庆　吕东浩（附图片）
