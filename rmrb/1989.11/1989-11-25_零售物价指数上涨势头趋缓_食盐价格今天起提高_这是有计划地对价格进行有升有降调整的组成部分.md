Retail Price Index Growth Slows Down; Salt Prices to Increase Starting Today

This is part of a planned adjustment of prices with both increases and decreases

According to a report from the State Price Bureau, since the beginning of this year, with the implementation of the policies for rectification and deepening reform, the market has gradually stabilized, and the upward trend in prices has slowed. In October, the retail price index for 35 large and medium-sized cities nationwide increased by 7.6% compared to the same period last year, a decrease of 23.7 percentage points from January's 31.3%. A significant number of commodities are experiencing sluggish sales, and the prices of some commodities have decreased, with some items dropping by more than half. Many commercial and industrial enterprises, in order to sell their products, are implementing price reductions. Fewer commodities are experiencing price increases, mainly with salt prices seeing a rise. This is part of the state's planned adjustment of prices, with both increases and decreases, which is beneficial for increasing production and ensuring supply.

It is understood that the retail price of salt will be increased nationwide starting November 25, with approval from the State Council. The retail price of 500 grams of loose raw salt in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, provincial capitals, autonomous region capitals, and municipalities directly under the central government will be increased by an average of 8 fen. The retail price of loose vacuum-refined salt from wells and mines will be increased by 1 jiao 1 fen. The price of processed salt made from raw salt will also be appropriately increased. To facilitate the circulation of salt, the retail price of salt in rural markets at the county level and below, where there is no price differential or the differential is too small in the circulation sector, will be regulated to arrange reasonable regional and urban-rural price differentials according to the direction of reasonable turnover.

Salt is an important commodity related to the national economy and people's livelihoods. The purpose of the price increase is to alleviate the long-term low price of salt, promote the development of salt production and smooth circulation, and adapt to the needs of national economic development and the supply of people's lives. The price of salt before the adjustment is even lower than at the beginning of the founding of the country. Many production enterprises have incurred varying degrees of losses. Many salt fields and equipment are in serious disrepair, and production is in a state of difficulty. The contradiction between supply and demand is becoming increasingly prominent. The circulation link of salt, due to the increase in transportation costs, fees, and bank interest rates, has also resulted in losses for many enterprises, and many operating units are unwilling to sell salt. Although this price increase for salt will increase the expenditure of the people, it can alleviate the difficulties in salt production and purchase, which is beneficial for the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy. It is believed that the people will understand and support this.

　　零售物价指数上涨势头趋缓
　　食盐价格今天起提高
    这是有计划地对价格进行有升有降调整的组成部分
    据新华社北京11月24日电　据国家物价局来的消息称，今年以来，随着治理整顿和深化改革方针的贯彻落实，市场日趋平稳，物价上涨势头逐渐缓和。10月份全国35个大中城市零售物价指数比去年同期上涨7.6％，比今年1月份的31.3％回缩了23.7个百分点。相当一部分商品销售疲软，部分商品价格有所降低，有的品种降低一半以上。许多工商企业为了推销产品，纷纷实行让利销售。涨价的商品较少，主要是盐价有所提高。这是国家有计划地对价格进行有升有降调整的组成部分，对增加生产和保证供应都有好处。
    据悉，提高食盐零售价格，经国务院批准，全国从11月25日起执行。散装原盐每500克的零售价格，北京、上海、天津和省会城市、自治区首府及计划单列市平均提高8分；散装井矿真空精盐零售价格提高1角1分；以原盐为原料的加工再制盐价格也相应适当提高。为有利于食盐流通，县及县以下农村市场的食盐零售价格，凡现在流通领域没有安排差价或差价偏小的，规定要按照合理的流转方向，安排合理的地区差价和城乡差价。
    盐是关系国计民生的重要商品，适当提价的目的是为缓解盐价长期偏低，促进盐业生产发展和流通通畅，适应国民经济发展和供应人民群众生活需要必须采取的措施。调整前的盐价比建国初期还低。相当一部分生产企业出现不同程度的亏损。许多盐田和设备失修严重，生产陷入难以为继的境地，产需矛盾日益突出。盐的流通环节由于运价、费用和银行利率的提高，也有不少企业发生亏损，许多经营单位不愿卖盐。这次提高食盐价格，虽然群众要增加一些支出，但是可以缓解产盐难、买盐难，有利于整个国民经济持续、稳定、协调地发展，相信群众是能够理解和支持的。
