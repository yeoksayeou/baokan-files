Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 27th.

A clever livestock-powered generator has been successfully developed by scientists from Beijing Beihai New Technology Company and Shanxi Province Datong Energy Company. Experts believe that this significant scientific achievement will effectively solve the electricity needs of over 300 million farmers and herdsmen in mountainous, pastoral, and remote areas, bringing them joy.

The generator, weighing approximately 60 kilograms, can be fixed to the ground. Livestock such as cows, horses, donkeys, and mules can be used to pull the generator in a circular motion. This movement, through a speed-increasing gearbox, drives the generator to produce electricity. The electricity is then rectified and stored in a battery. Once the battery is fully charged, it can be taken home and connected to electrical appliances such as lights, televisions, and radios. If more power is needed, the battery can be recharged. According to the company's representative, this generator, costing around 1,400 yuan, can meet the electricity needs of 10 to 15 households for lighting, watching TV, and listening to the radio. Including the cost of the battery, lights, and wires, each household would need to invest around 360 yuan initially. The generator has a lifespan of 15 years, meaning each household would spend only about 20 yuan per year, which is less than the cost of using kerosene lamps.

This unique scientific achievement has been granted a national patent. Currently, many farmers and herdsmen are placing orders for the generator. Some third-world countries have also expressed interest in acquiring the technology.

　　畜力发电机轻巧又方便
　　三亿农牧民将解决生活用电问题
    本报北京11月27日讯　记者何黄彪报道：一种巧妙的畜力发电机已由北京北海新技术公司和山西省大同能源公司的科技人员联合研制开发成功。专家们认为这项重要科研成果，将十分有效地解决我国3亿多山区、牧区、边远地区无电农牧民的生活用电问题，给这些人民带来欢乐。
    只要把约60公斤重的发电机固定在地面上，用牲畜（牛、马、驴、骡）环形拉动畜力拉动杆，经增速箱传动机构带动发电机即可发电，再经整流把电输入蓄电瓶，蓄足电后拿回家接上电线即可使用，电力不够时再次充电就行。据公司负责人介绍，这种发电机只花1400多元，就可解决10至15户家庭的照明、看电视和听广播等生活用电，再加上电瓶、灯、线等费用，每户一次性投资仅360多元。本机寿命为15年，每户平均每年才花20多元，比点煤油灯耗资少。
    这项独特的科研成果已获得国家专利。目前许多农牧民纷纷订货；有的第三世界国家也前来洽谈技术转让。
