The natural resources of agriculture in today's world are decreasing, and the environment is deteriorating, which has become a prominent issue of common concern for both developed countries and developing countries. Some developed countries, due to the overuse of fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals, have led to soil and food pollution. Simultaneously, industrial pollution, such as smog, acid rain, wastewater, increased carbon dioxide, and the release of chlorine and fluorine compounds, has damaged the ozone layer, affecting or threatening the health of humans and the entire biosphere. Some low-income, food-deficient countries are facing the pressures of rapid population growth and expanding poverty, relying on extensive farming and extensive management, which has severely damaged natural resources and the environment.

In recent years, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Population Fund, and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis have conducted surveys and research in regions such as Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Their conclusion is that without long-term protection measures, global rain-fed cropland will decrease by 18%.

The world's tropical forest area is 1.935 billion hectares, including 1.2 billion hectares of dense forest and 735 million hectares of sparse forest. Currently, tropical forests are decreasing at a rate of 11.5 million hectares per year, while newly planted forests are less than 20 million hectares per year. The main reasons for forest destruction include clearing forests for grazing, increasing demand for firewood (more than two-thirds of households in developing countries rely on firewood as their primary energy source), uncontrolled logging, and forest fires. In many places, the tropical forest ecosystem can no longer perform its normal basic functions of conserving water and soil, regulating climate, and sustaining livelihoods. In the upstream areas of some rivers in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, deforestation often leads to floods and severe degradation of soil productivity. Every year, the world's rivers carry 2.4 billion tons of fertile topsoil into the sea.

One-third of the world's land is threatened by desertification. In 1984, 850 million people lived in arid regions worldwide, with 230 million people living in areas severely affected by desertification. In Africa, Asia, and Latin America, 870 million hectares of arable land have been desertified, resulting in nearly 21 million hectares of land with little economic value each year. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 80% of desertification worldwide is due to poor resource management, including increasing pressure from population and livestock growth, overgrazing, forest fires, and uncontrolled deforestation. In nine southern African countries, the number of cattle exceeds the ecological carrying capacity by 50-100%. In the Sahel region, deforestation is severe, and in Mali, the Sahara Desert has moved southward by approximately 17 kilometers over the past 20 years.

The phenomenon of soil degradation (including soil erosion, salinization, acidification, and physical and biological deterioration) is also expanding. In the arid regions of North Africa and the Near East, as well as parts of South Asia, East Asia, and Latin America, soil erosion is severe. In a joint assessment by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the United Nations Environment Programme, it was found that in sub-Saharan Africa, 11.5% of the land is affected by water erosion, and 22.4% by wind erosion. In the Near East, 17.1% of the land is affected by water erosion, and 35.5% by wind erosion. Soil degradation is largely due to improper use and inappropriate cropping patterns. Globally, 40 million hectares of irrigated land are either waterlogged or salinized, or both, due to improper irrigation and drainage. In Asia and Africa, uncontrolled groundwater extraction has led to a decrease in aquifer water levels and a drop in groundwater levels, causing some pastures and croplands to become barren.

The agricultural environment is deteriorating. The continuous development of agriculture will cause irreparable damage, especially irreversible climate change, which may have adverse effects on agriculture in the next century. If this situation is not addressed and effective measures are not taken, the situation will continue to worsen.

In December 1987, the United Nations General Assembly discussed the environmental outlook for the year 2000 and beyond, and the relationship between environment and development. The clear goal set for the food and agriculture sector is to "achieve food security without depleting resources or damaging the environment, and to restore resources that have already been damaged." It also calls for "developing long-term strategies for sustainable development that do not harm the environment." In May of this year, the 15th Ministerial Session of the World Food Council made "managing agriculture from an environmental perspective to achieve sustainable food security" a central theme. Protecting and improving the environment is a shared responsibility of humanity and must be of concern to the international community, with international cooperation ensuring its implementation. To protect and improve the agricultural environment, it is necessary to adopt agricultural measures that are suitable for local conditions and beneficial to the environment, such as combining engineering and biological measures to conserve water and soil, building terraces, flood control and drainage, planting trees and grasses, planting leguminous crops, intercropping, crop rotation, combining organic fertilizers, chemical fertilizers, and biological nitrogen fixation, selecting varieties with strong resistance, reducing or eliminating tillage, preserving and utilizing genetic resources, and utilizing biogas and solar energy to restore and enhance land productivity.

Governments of various countries should propose strategic measures for the protection, improvement, and utilization of resources such as water and soil, forests, grasslands, and water bodies, and coordinate the work of various departments. The goal is to improve the long-term productivity of natural resources and enhance the ability of local communities to solve their own food and other basic needs. International cooperation should be promoted, calling on the international community to provide loans and aid to low-income, food-deficient countries to improve water and soil management, enhance agricultural productivity, encourage applied research, information dissemination, and technical assistance to promote resource protection and environmentally friendly agricultural technologies.

    密切关注世界农业环境问题
    朱丕荣
    当今世界农业的自然资源在减少、环境在恶化，已成为发达国家和发展中国家共同关心的日益突出的问题。一些发达国家由于过多地使用化肥、农药等，导致水土和食物的污染。同时，由于过分集中的工业所引起的污染，如烟雾、酸雨、污水、二氧化碳增多，含氯、氟物的排放，臭氧层的破坏，影响或威胁人类和整个生物的健康。一些低收入缺粮国家正在经受着人口迅速增长和贫困日渐扩展的压力，依靠广种薄收，粗放经营，使自然资源和环境遭到严重破坏。
    联合国粮农组织、联合国人口活动基金和国际应用体系分析研究所近年来对非洲、亚洲和拉美、加勒比海等地区进行了调查研究，其结论是，如果没有长期的保护措施，全球雨育作物土地将减少18％。
    世界热带森林面积19.35亿公顷，其中密闭林12亿公顷，稀疏林7.35亿公顷。现在热带林正以每年1150万公顷的速度减少，而新造的森林每年不足200万公顷。森林遭破坏的主要原因是毁林开垦放牧，对薪材的需求不断增长（发展中国家2／3以上的农户主要以薪材作为家庭能源）、无人管理的滥砍乱伐以及森林火灾等。很多地方的热带森林生态系统已不再能对保持水土、调节气候、维持生计等起正常的基本作用。在南亚、东南亚和拉美的一些河流上游的毁林，往往造成洪水泛滥、土壤生产力受到严重破坏。世界上的河流每年会把240亿吨肥沃表土带入海中。
    全球土地的1／3面临着沙漠化的威胁。1984年世界上的干旱地区养活着8.5亿人口，其中2.3亿人口生活在受到严重沙漠化影响的土地上，在非洲、亚洲和拉美共有8.7亿公顷的耕地沙漠化了，由此每年有2100万公顷的土地几乎没有什么经济收益。据联合国粮农组织调查，世界范围80％的沙漠化是因对资源管理不善造成的，包括人口和畜群不断增加的压力、过度放牧、丛林火灾、无控制的毁林垦殖。在9个南部非洲国家，牛的数量超出生态载畜力的50—100％，在萨赫勒地区的毁林十分严重，在马里，撒哈拉沙漠在过去20年中每年向南移动约17公里。
    土壤退化（包括土壤侵蚀、盐碱化、酸化以及物理和生物性变劣）的现象也在扩展。在北非和近东的干旱地区和南亚、东亚及拉美的部分地区，土壤风蚀很严重。联合国粮农组织和联合国环境规划署在进行的一次联合评估中发现，在赤道以北的非洲，全部土地的11.5％受到水的侵蚀，22.4％受到风的侵蚀，近东的全部土地的17.1％受到水的侵蚀，35.5％受到风的侵蚀。土地退化很大程度是因为使用不当和种植结构不妥。全球有4000万公顷的灌溉面积由于排灌不当，不是水涝就是盐碱化或者两者兼有。在亚洲和非洲由于无控制地抽取地下水，蓄水层水量减少，地下水位下降，使一些牧场和作物耕地荒芜。
    农业环境趋于恶化。对于农业持续发展将造成无可弥补的损害，特别是发生不可逆转的气候变化，可能对下一个世纪农业带来不利影响。如果现在还不引起重视采取有效措施，这种局势将会继续发展。
    1987年12月联合国大会讨论了2000年及以后的环境前景和环境与发展问题。对粮食和农业领域提出的明确目标是“达到既无粮食匮乏之虞，又不耗竭资源或破坏环境，重建已经发生环境损害的资源基础”。还要求“为持续的、不影响环境的发展制定长期战略”。今年5月，世界粮食理事会第15届部长级会议把“从环境着眼管理农业实现持续的粮食安全”作为一个中心议题。保护和改善环境是人类的共同责任，必须引起国际社会的密切关注，通过国际合作加以保证。为了保护和改善农业环境，应当因地制宜地推广和采用有利于改善环境的农业措施，如工程和生物措施结合保持水土，兴修梯田，防洪排涝，植树种草、种植豆科作物，间作复种，轮作倒茬，有机肥、化肥、生物固氮相结合，选种抗逆力强的品种，少耕或免耕，保存和利用遗传资源，利用沼气、太阳能源等，来恢复和提高土地生产能力。
    各国政府对保持水土，森林、草原、水域等资源的保护、改善和利用提出战略措施并协调各部门的工作。实现的目标是要提高自然资源的长期生产力，增强当地自力更生地解决粮食和其他基本需要的能力。开展国际合作，呼吁国际社会对低收入缺粮国提供贷款和援助，以改进水土环境的管理，提高农业生产力，鼓励应用研究、信息传播和技术援助，以促进资源保护和使用对环境无害的农业技术。
