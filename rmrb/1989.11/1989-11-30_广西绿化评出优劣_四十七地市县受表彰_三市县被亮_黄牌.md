Guangxi has announced the list of counties with outstanding and poor forestation performance and has awarded and criticized them accordingly. Forty-seven counties with outstanding performance received awards and prize money from the Autonomous Region Party Committee and Government. Hecheng City, Pingxiang City, and Liujiang County were given yellow cards for poor forestation efforts.

Guangxi has over 60 million mu of barren mountains suitable for afforestation. In early 1987, the Autonomous Region Party Committee and Government decided to achieve basic afforestation of Guangxi by the end of the century. This evaluation is a comprehensive summary of the forestation achievements over the past three years.

After suffering the consequences of deforestation, Luchuan County, which has been carrying out large-scale afforestation in recent years, received a first-class award of 30,000 yuan along with three other counties. County Magistrate Lü Zhihui said that Luchuan County will have no more barren mountains by next year.

At the summary and award ceremony, nearly 100 county party and government leaders signed a four-year forestation target responsibility agreement with the Autonomous Region Party Committee and Government.

　　广西绿化评出优劣
　　四十七地市县受表彰
　　三市县被亮“黄牌”
    本报南宁11月29日电　记者郑盛丰报道：广西昨天公布了造林绿化优劣单位名单并分别给予奖励和批评。47个成绩突出的地市县，领走了自治区党委和政府颁发的奖旗和奖金，合山市、凭祥市、柳江县因造林不力被亮“黄牌”警告。
    广西有宜林荒山6000多万亩。1987年初，区党委、区政府做出到本世纪末基本绿化广西的决定。这次评比，是对近3年造林绿化实绩的全面总结。
    吃够了毁林苦头后，于近几年开展大规模造林活动的陆川县，这次与另3个县一道领了数额为3万元的一等奖奖金。县长吕志辉说，陆川县到明年就不再有荒山了。
    在总结表彰大会上，近百个地市县的党政负责人，还与自治区党委和政府签订了为期4年的造林目标责任状。
