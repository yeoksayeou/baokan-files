Xinhua News Agency, Hubei, Shiyan, November 16th - Reporter Wang Yougong learned from the enterprise science and technology progress conference, which opened today, that since the Sixth Five-Year Plan, China has invested 380 billion yuan in enterprise technological transformation, completing more than 370,000 technological transformation projects. Among these, 1,600 large and medium-sized enterprises have undergone key transformations, promoting these enterprises to follow a path of internal development and simultaneously raising the overall level of China's economy.

Large-scale introduction, absorption, and digestion of foreign advanced technologies have accelerated the technological progress of many of China's large and medium-sized enterprises. Since the 1980s, China has used more than $100 billion to introduce over 10,000 items of foreign advanced technology, effectively changing the backward appearance of a large number of Chinese enterprises and strengthening some weak links in the national economy.

However, the overall technological progress of China's large and medium-sized enterprises is still not satisfactory. Deputy Director of the State Science and Technology Commission Zhou Ping pointed out at the opening ceremony of today's conference that due to various reasons, a large number of China's large and medium-sized enterprises are still using outdated equipment from the 1950s and 1960s, seriously affecting the quality and level of products, and also causing serious waste of energy and materials. It is estimated that due to the slow pace of scientific and technological progress in China's large and medium-sized enterprises, the capital output rate of enterprises is low and economic benefits are poor. Currently, in developed countries, every unit of fixed assets provides a value of 3-5 units, while in China, it was 1.78 units in the 1970s and dropped to 1.2 units in the early 1980s, with the gap widening.

    我国大中型企业走内涵发展道路
    三十七万个技改项目完成
    本报湖北十堰十一月十六日电  记者王友恭从今天在此开幕的企业科技进步座谈会上获悉：“六五”以来，我国用于企业技术改造的投资已达三千八百多亿元，完成技术改造项目三十七万多个，其中进行重点改造的大中型企业达一千六百多家，促进了这些企业走内涵发展的道路，同时也提高了我国经济的整体水平。
    大规模引进、吸收、消化国外先进技术加快了我国许多大中型企业技术进步的步伐。八十年代以来，我国用一百多亿美元引进了上万项国外先进技术，从而有效地改变了我国一大批企业落后的面貌，加强了国民经济中的一些薄弱环节。
    但是，我国整个大中型企业的技术进步情况仍然不能令人满意。国家科委副主任周平在今天的座谈会开幕式上指出，由于种种原因，我国仍有一大批大中型企业还在使用着五十、六十年代的陈旧设备，严重地影响了产品的质量、水平，同时也造成能源材料的严重浪费。据测算，由于我国大中型企业科技进步速度慢，致使企业的资金产出率低、经济效益差。现在发达国家每一元固定资产提供的产值为三—五元，而我国在七十年代为一点七八元，八十年代初降为一点二元，差距在加大。
