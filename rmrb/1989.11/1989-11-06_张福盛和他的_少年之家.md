In the city of Jiexiu County, Shanxi Province, the home of retired military officer Zhang Fusheng has a plaque given by the Jiexiu County Committee and the county government, with the words "Youth Home" in gold letters. When it comes to Zhang Fusheng, almost everyone in the county knows him.

Zhang Fusheng is 67 years old. Eighteen years ago, due to multiple illnesses, he retired and returned to his hometown. At that time, it was the turbulent era when the "Gang of Four" advocated the "uselessness of studying," students fought, skipped classes, broke windows, insulted teachers, and took pride in handing in blank papers. All of this, Old Zhang saw with his own eyes. Having participated in the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, and having gone through gunfire and shelling, Zhang Fusheng thought, "I have fought and struggled for half my life, hoping for the early prosperity of the motherland. Now this, is this how we cultivate revolutionary successors? This is not cultivating successors, but raising troublemakers!" Zhang Fusheng reported his anxious feelings and his intention to contribute to the cultivation of successors to the leaders of the county's Military Affairs Department. He received their support.

In March 1971, Zhang Fusheng came to Chengguan Nan Street Primary School. The school leaders and teachers warmly welcomed him. His first lesson to the students was about his personal battle experiences, the four major atrocities committed by the Japanese invaders in Jiexiu County, and the stories of heroic anti-Japanese fighters. His report deeply moved the students. Some notorious "heroes" who were known for fighting calmed down, and the school's teaching order began to improve. The news spread, and schools in the county city all invited him to give traditional classes. Later, many schools across the county also hired him as an off-campus instructor.

As Zhang Fusheng aged, his health deteriorated, making it difficult for him to go out to teach. After discussing with his wife, he used his savings of over 6,800 yuan to build four rooms, and spent over 5,000 yuan to subscribe to newspapers, magazines, books, and picture books, and bought toys, televisions, and tape recorders, establishing a "family guidance station," which was later changed to the "Youth Home." In recent years, Zhang Fusheng's "Youth Home" has hosted students from 19 schools in the city and countryside, totaling over 20,000 visits.

Zhang Fusheng's "Youth Home" is highly popular among children throughout the county and is praised by the public. The Jiexiu County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanxi Provincial Military Region have successively awarded Zhang Fusheng the honorary titles of "Model Off-Campus Instructor" and "Excellent Communist Party Member."

    张福盛和他的“少年之家”
    史国山
    在山西省介休县城内，军队离休干部张福盛的家门上，挂着一块介休县委、县政府赠送的嵌着“少年之家”四个金字的大匾。提起张福盛，县城里几乎是妇孺皆知。
    张福盛今年67岁，18年前，因身患多种疾病离休回到家乡。那时，正是“四人帮”鼓吹“读书无用论”的动荡年代，学生打架斗殴，旷课，砸玻璃，辱骂老师，以交白卷为荣……这一切，老张看在眼里。参加过抗日战争、解放战争，从枪林弹雨中过来的张福盛想，我出生入死，革命了大半辈子，盼的是祖国早日强盛。现在这样，哪是培养革命接班人，这不是在培养败家子么！张福盛找到县武装部领导，汇报了自己的焦急心情和愿为培养接班人贡献力量的打算。他得到了领导的支持。
    1971年3月，张福盛来到城关南街小学。校领导和老师们热诚地欢迎他。他给同学们上的第一课，就是讲自己亲身的战斗经历，日寇在介休县制造的四大惨案及抗敌英雄英勇献身的战斗故事。他的报告深深地打动了同学们的心。一些打架出名的“英雄”收敛了，学校教学秩序开始好转。消息传开，县城里的学校都请他上传统课，后来全县很多学校也聘请他为校外辅导员。
    随着年龄的增长，张福盛的身体越来越差，难以外出讲课了。他同老伴商量之后，用自己多年积攒的6800多元钱修了4间房屋，又拿出5000多元订购了报纸、杂志、图书、画册，买了玩具、电视机、录音机等，办起了“家庭辅导站”，后改为“少年之家”。近几年来，张福盛的“少年之家”共接待城乡19个学校的学生，共计2万多人次。
    张福盛办的“少年之家”深受全县孩子们的欢迎，也受到群众的称赞。中共介休县委、山西省军区先后授予张福盛“模范校外辅导员”、“优秀共产党员”等光荣称号。
