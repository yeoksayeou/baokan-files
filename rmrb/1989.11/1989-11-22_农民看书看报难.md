Farmers Face Difficulties in Reading Books and Newspapers

Nowadays, in rural areas, it is quite difficult for farmers to read books and newspapers. Many people hope to learn scientific and technological knowledge, understand relevant policies, and grasp information on getting rich through reading books and newspapers, but they often fail to achieve this. The specific reasons are as follows:

Although cultural stations have been established in townships and cultural workers have been assigned, these stations lack activity facilities and have no fixed locations. They also lack newspapers, magazines, and agricultural science and technology books for farmers. Some cultural stations only have old books. The staff of some cultural stations are often sent to do other work and rarely attend to their own duties. Some cultural station workers even use the station's rooms to sell cloth, sugar, cigarettes, and alcohol.

The newspapers and magazines subscribed to by village committees are often intercepted by individuals because there is no one to manage them. Some people only glance at them, while others use them to paper windows, cover walls, or wrap other items. Even if they are sent to a fixed location, they often pile up and cannot fully play their role. Some village cadres treat the newspapers and magazines subscribed to by the masses as their own property and do not allow others to read them.

The books and magazines that farmers need most are hard to buy. The Xinhua Bookstore has no sales outlets in rural areas, and the supply and marketing cooperatives are reluctant to handle books and magazines because the profit is small, so farmers have to go to the city to buy books. Many farmers want to subscribe to newspapers but are worried about not receiving them because newspapers cannot be delivered directly to their homes. Postal workers often only deliver newspapers, magazines, and letters to the homes of village cadres, sometimes only once every half month.

Moreover, the books and magazines that farmers urgently need to buy are those related to practical agricultural production technology and planting, breeding, and processing experiences for getting rich, but they do not know where to buy these.

The author suggests that relevant departments at all levels should manage and address these issues, making rural cultural stations (rooms) truly become a battlefield for ideological education, a classroom for cultural and technological knowledge, a window for information exchange, and a venue for cultural and sports activities, playing a role in the construction of both material and spiritual civilization in rural areas.

### 农民看书看报难

　　农民看书看报难
    如今乡下，农民读书看报实在难。许多人希望通过读书看报，能够学到科技知识，了解有关政策，掌握致富信息，但却不能如愿以偿。具体原因是：
    现在乡镇虽然都设有文化站，并配有文化干部。但文化站缺少活动设施，没有固定的场所，缺乏农民看的报刊杂志，农业科技书籍更少。有些文化站存放的书籍多是些“陈年旧货”。有的文化站人员经常抽去搞其它工作，对本职工作很少过问。还有的文化站工作人员，把文化站中的房屋占为己有，摆上布匹、糖烟酒，做起生意来了。
    村委会订的报刊因无人管理，常常被个别人截留，有的看上一眼，有的连看也不看就拿去糊窗户、贴墙，或包装其它物品了。即使送到某一固定地点也是常常堆积起来，不能充分发挥作用。还有些村干部把群众订的报刊视为己有，不让其他群众阅读。
    农民最需要的书刊很难买到。新华书店在农村没有销售网点，供销社也因经营书刊利小而不愿经销，农民买书只得进城。有不少农民想订报纸可又担心收不到，原因是报纸不能直接送到户，邮递员往往只将报刊、书信送到村干部家里，有时候半月才送一次。
    另外，农民急需购买的书刊是有关农业生产实用技术和种植、养殖、加工致富经验的，可这些书刊又不知道哪里有卖。
    笔者建议各地有关部门管一管、抓一抓这些事，使农村文化站（室）真正成为思想教育的阵地，文化技术的课堂，信息交流的窗口，文体活动的场所，在农村两个文明建设中发挥作用。
