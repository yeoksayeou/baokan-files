Title: Entrepreneurs

Entrepreneurs like Bai Hang leave behind a stretch of green mountains and clear waters. This is not found in the paintings of the ancients, nor in the hazy dreams of the past. Water is a flowing granary, and it carries the entrepreneurial spirit of love for the country. If one can leave something for the people, one will never truly die.
