	Asia Weekly Defamed and Sued, Singapore High Court Rules in Favor of Bank of China Branch
	The Bank of China's Singapore branch recently sued Asia Weekly (Chinese edition) for defamation and won the case in the Singapore High Court. The court ruled in favor of the Bank of China's Singapore branch.

	In the June 18 issue, Asia Weekly published an article stating that after China suppressed the counterrevolutionary riots, there was a run on the bank in its Singapore branch, claiming, "People withdrew approximately $75 million in deposits, forcing the bank to temporarily suspend operations." The bank believed that this report was false and defamatory, and thus filed a lawsuit.

	The Bank of China's Singapore branch argued that the text in Asia Weekly was intended to defame the bank's reputation and cause public damage, and therefore demanded compensation for the losses.

	In its defense, Asia Weekly denied malicious defamation against the Bank of China's Singapore branch and also denied that the published text had the intention to harm the bank's reputation.

	On November 3, Senior Assistant Registrar Huang Binghong of the Singapore High Court made a ruling on the case. He accepted the arguments presented by the plaintiff's lawyer, determining that the defendant's defense was unreasonable and unfounded.

	The court also ruled that the defendant should bear the legal costs, with the amount of compensation to be determined at a later date.

    《亚洲周刊》造谣诽谤被起诉
    新加坡高法判中国银行分行胜诉
    新华社新加坡11月7日电  （记者李永明）中国银行新加坡分行起诉《亚洲周刊》（中文版）对该行进行诽谤案最近获新加坡高等法院裁决，法院判中国银行新加坡分行胜诉。
    《亚洲周刊》在今年6月18日一期中刊登一篇文章，提及中国平息反革命暴乱后在新加坡分行发生挤提现象时说，“人们共提取了约合7500万美元的存款，使银行不得不暂时停止营业”。该行认为，《亚洲周刊》这一报道与事实不符，是对该行的诽谤，遂对其提出起诉。
    中国银行新加坡分行指出，《亚洲周刊》这段文字旨在诋毁该行信誉，使该行在公众人士中名誉受损，因此要求该杂志赔偿损失。
    《亚洲周刊》在抗辩时否认恶意诽谤中国银行新加坡分行，也否认所刊登的文字含有损害该行名誉的用意。
    11月3日，新加坡高等法院高级助理主簿官黄炳鸿对此案进行裁决。他接受原告代表律师的陈词，裁决被告提出的抗辩是不合理和没有根据的。
    法庭还裁决被告负担讼费，赔偿费则另订日期评定。
