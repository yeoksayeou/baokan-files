Dhaka is Boiling

By Shī Zōngxīng, Correspondent

Bidding farewell to Islamabad, Premier Li and his entourage boarded a plane heading east, flying over the fertile and beautiful Punjab Plain, and crossing the vast expanse of Indian territory, arriving in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, at 2:00 PM local time on the 17th.

This historic city in the subtropical region is lush with green trees and fragrant with blooming flowers, truly enchanting. The fiery friendship expressed by the Bangladeshi government and people towards the Chinese guests is deeply moving and unforgettable.

Premier Li Peng's visit has made the entire city of Dhaka boil with excitement.

Three of Bangladesh's top leaders—President Ershad, Vice President Mudud, and Prime Minister Kazi—all came to the airport to welcome Premier Li. President Ershad and Premier Li Peng embraced each other like long-lost brothers at the foot of the aircraft stairs. The atmosphere was sincere, warm, and deeply moving.

Hundreds of young women dressed in colorful saris, holding baskets of flowers, threw rose petals and jasmine flowers at Premier Li and his wife. The fresh flowers fell like rain on the Chinese guests, filling the air with a fragrant scent. Friends explained that in Bangladesh, red roses symbolize passion, and white jasmine symbolizes purity. Offering these two types of flowers to the Chinese guests signifies that the friendship between the two peoples is both passionate and pure.

As soon as Premier Li Peng's car left the airport, it was enveloped in a colorful corridor of friendship. Tens of thousands of people lined both sides of the streets, welcoming the delegation. Flags and flowers adorned every street and intersection in Dhaka.

This scene reminded one of the words Deng Xiaoping had said to President Ershad two years ago: "China and Bangladesh are good friends, and the leaders of the two countries are also good friends, and can speak from the heart."

Although Bangladesh has only been independent for 18 years, the friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Bangladesh can be traced back to ancient times. From the Tang Dynasty monk Xuanzang to the Ming Dynasty navigator Zheng He, they all left footprints of friendship on Bangladeshi soil, sowing the seeds of friendship. Since the founding of New China, especially since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Bangladesh, guided by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the two countries have treated each other sincerely, trusted each other fully, and supported each other, making the tree of Sino-Bangladeshi friendship more vibrant and able to withstand the test of storms. A very convincing example occurred not long ago. In early June of this year, after China suppressed the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, some people in the international community stirred up a wave of criticism and sanctions against China. At this time, a strong voice came from Dhaka: "What happened in China is purely China's internal affair and does not allow external interference... Bangladesh will always be a friend of China." President Ershad's clear stance expressed to the Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh in late June not only demonstrated the Bangladeshi government's political foresight and courage but also left an indelible impression in the hearts of the Chinese people.

At 3:30 PM, without resting, Premier Li drove to the Savar National Martyrs' Memorial. There, Premier Li laid a wreath of fresh flowers and planted a tree of friendship in the cemetery as a permanent memorial to his visit, symbolizing the everlasting friendship between China and Bangladesh. What was moving was that during the 40-minute journey from the state guesthouse to the martyrs' cemetery, Premier Li received a full escort welcome. People's emotions were sincere and enthusiastic, some waving flags and garlands, shouting "Welcome, Li Peng!" while others danced to lively music. Premier Li and his entourage were deeply moved by this touching scene.

Dhaka is boiling, and the friendship between the peoples of China and Bangladesh is elevated with Premier Li's visit.

    达卡沸腾了
    本报记者  史宗星
    告别伊斯兰堡，李总理一行乘机东行，掠过富饶美丽的旁遮普平原，飞越幅员辽阔的印度国土，于当地时间17日14时抵达孟加拉国首都达卡。
    地处亚热带的这座南亚历史名城，绿树婆娑，百花溢香，景色着实迷人。孟加拉国政府和人民向中国客人表达的火一般的友情更是令人感动和难忘。
    李鹏总理的来访使整个达卡城都沸腾起来了。
    孟加拉国的3位主要领导人艾尔沙德总统、穆杜德副总统、卡齐总理都到机场迎接李总理。艾尔沙德总统和李鹏总理像久别重逢的亲兄弟一样，在舷梯旁紧紧拥抱，气氛真挚、热烈，十分感人。
    机场上数百名身着色彩鲜艳莎丽的姑娘，手托藤编的花盘，纷纷向李总理和夫人抛洒玫瑰花瓣和茉莉花朵。水灵灵的鲜花雨点般洒落在中国客人身上，散溢出沁人的清香。据朋友介绍，在孟加拉国，紫红的玫瑰象征热烈，雪白的茉莉象征纯洁。把这两种花献给中国客人，说明孟中两国人民的友谊既热烈似火，又纯洁无瑕。
    李鹏总理座车一驶出机场，就淹没在一条色彩缤纷的友谊走廊里。数十万人列队两旁，夹道欢迎。达卡各个街头路口，彩旗招展，花团锦簇。
    此情此景，不禁让人想起两年前邓小平同志对艾尔沙德总统说过的一句话：“中国和孟加拉国是好朋友，两国领导人也是好朋友，可以交心。”
    孟加拉国独立虽只有18年历史，但中孟人民的友好交往却可以追溯到久远的年代。从中国唐代高僧玄奘，到明代航海家郑和，都在孟加拉的土地上留下过友谊的足迹，播下了友谊的种子。新中国成立后，特别是中孟建交以来，在和平共处五项原则指导下，两国真诚相待，充分信任，相互支持，使中孟友谊之树愈加生机勃发，经受住了风风雨雨的考验。一个很有说服力的事例就发生在不久之前。今年6月初，当中国平息北京发生的反革命暴乱后，国际上有人掀起一股指责中国、制裁中国的逆流。而在这时，从达卡传出了一个有力的声音：“中国发生的事情纯属中国的内政，不容外来干涉……孟加拉国永远是中国的朋友”。艾尔沙德总统6月下旬对中国驻孟加拉国大使表示的这一鲜明立场，再次体现了孟加拉国政府政治上的远见和勇气，也在中国人民的心中留下了不可磨灭的印象。
    下午三时半，李总理没来得及休息，便驱车去萨瓦尔国家烈士纪念碑。在那里，李总理敬献了一个用鲜花扎成的花圈，还在陵园内栽了一棵友谊树，作为他这次来访的永久纪念，也象征中孟友谊万古长青。令人感动的是，在从国宾馆到烈士陵园40分钟的路途中，李总理往返都受到了全程夹道欢迎。人们的感情真挚、热切，或挥舞着彩旗、花串，高声欢呼“欢迎李鹏！”或伴着明快的音乐跳起舞来。李鹏总理一行无不为这动人的情景所感动。
    达卡在沸腾，中孟两国人民的友谊随着李总理的来访在升华。
