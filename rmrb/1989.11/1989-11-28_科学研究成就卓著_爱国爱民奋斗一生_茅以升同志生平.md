Comrade Mao Yisheng, whose courtesy name was Tangchen, was born in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, in January 1896. After graduating from Tangshan Industrial School in 1916, he was selected to study in the United States on a government scholarship. In 1917, he graduated from the Cornell University Graduate School with a master's degree in bridge engineering; in 1919, he earned a Ph.D. in engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. After returning to China in 1920, he served as a professor at Tangshan Industrial School, a professor and dean of the College of Engineering at Southeast University in Nanjing, a professor and president of the College of Engineering at Huanhai University in Nanjing, a professor at Beiyang University, the president and professor of Beiyang Engineering College in Tianjin, and the president of the College of Engineering at Tongji University in Tangshan. During this period, he also served as the director of the Jiangsu Water Conservancy Bureau from 1930 to 1931, the director of the Qiantang River Bridge Construction Office in Zhejiang Province from 1934 to 1937 (holding this position until 1949), the director of the Bridge Design Office of the Ministry of Communications from 1942 to 1943, and the general manager of the China Bridge Company from 1943 to 1949. From 1949 to 1952, he served as the president of the China Railway University and the Northern Railway University. From 1951 to 1981, he served as the director of the Railway Technical Research Institute and the president of the Railway Science Research Institute.

Comrade Mao Yisheng was a representative to the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a member of the 2nd to 6th National Committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and a vice chairman of the 6th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He was also a member of the Standing Committee of the 1st to 6th National People's Congress. Since 1958, he served as a vice chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League (Jiusan Society) and later as the honorary chairman.

Comrade Mao Yisheng was a renowned scientist and an outstanding bridge engineer. In 1919, his doctoral thesis "Secondary Stress in Frame Structures" at Carnegie Mellon University reached the world's leading level at the time. His scientific insights were known as "Mao's Law," and he was awarded the "Fitch" Research Medal by his alma mater, Cornell University. In the 1930s, he oversaw the design and construction of the Qiantang River Bridge, the first modern railway and highway bridge designed and built by Chinese engineers. This bridge's engineering achievements boosted the confidence of the Chinese people in bridge construction and earned respect from foreign counterparts. In the 1950s, during the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Comrade Mao Yisheng served as the chairman of the Technical Advisory Committee composed of more than 20 Chinese and foreign experts. He led the committee to solve 14 technical challenges in the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, contributing his technical expertise and experience to the construction of the first modern bridge in New China. In 1959, during the construction of the Ten Major Buildings in Beijing, Comrade Mao Yisheng served as the head of the structural review committee for the Great Hall of the People. Premier Zhou Enlai designated Comrade Mao Yisheng to approve the design plan and sign it, taking responsibility for ensuring the safety of the Great Hall of the People. This reflected the respect and trust of the central leadership for him. In 1978, Comrade Mao Yisheng oversaw the compilation of "A History of Ancient Chinese Bridges," providing a technical summary of ancient Chinese bridges. He led the Railway Technical Research Institute and the Railway Science Research Institute for 30 years. During his tenure, he proposed the institutional motto "All for research, research for transportation," repeatedly led the formulation of railway scientific research development plans, and clarified the focus of research serving railway transportation. He promoted international scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation, transforming the institute into a comprehensive professional research institution with a full range of disciplines and strong technical strength. This provided a large number of research results for China's railway transportation production and construction, and trained a large number of scientific and technological talents. Due to Comrade Mao Yisheng's outstanding achievements in bridge engineering, in 1941, the Chinese Engineering Society awarded him the Honorary Medal, in 1947, he was elected as the president of the Chinese Engineering Society, and he was also elected as an academician of the Central Research Institute. After liberation, he served as the chairman of the Shanghai Science and Technology Association, the chairman and honorary chairman of the Beijing Science and Technology Association, a member of the Academic Division of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the vice chairman of the Technical Sciences Division, the president of the Chinese Society of Civil Engineering from 1953, and the vice chairman of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology from 1958. In 1986, he was appointed as the honorary chairman of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology. Comrade Mao Yisheng's achievements in the field of bridge engineering have been widely recognized internationally. As early as 1956, he became an individual member of the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering. In 1979, he was awarded the "Distinguished Alumni" medal by Carnegie Mellon University, in 1982, he was elected as a foreign academician by the U.S. National Academy of Engineering, and in 1984, he was elected as an honorary member of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers.

Comrade Mao Yisheng was a renowned educator. After returning from the United States in 1920, he devoted himself to the education sector until 1952, serving in the education sector for over 20 years. He served as a professor at five schools, the president of two universities, and the dean of two colleges. As early as 1926, Comrade Mao Yisheng pointed out that China's education "retained the feudal soul and adopted the Western body," advocating for reform. He proposed that engineering education should combine theory with practice, "learn first, then study, and learn while practicing," integrating research, teaching, and production. He published many articles on reforming and developing China's engineering education, such as "The Liberation of Education," "Scientific Education in the New Era," and "Principles and Methods of Engineering Education." In teaching methods, he emphasized inspiration over indoctrination, abandoning the traditional teaching method of rote learning, and transforming students from passive recipients to active participants. He organically combined the ancient Chinese concept of "teaching and learning from each other" with the essence of Western educational thought, applying it flexibly and earning high praise from students. The famous educator Tao Xingzhi praised Comrade Mao Yisheng's teaching method as "a truly new revolution in education, setting a precedent in China's education." In the early days of New China, he suggested establishing correspondence universities to quickly train specialized talents for socialist construction, which received high attention from the Party and the government. Comrade Mao Yisheng actively promoted science popularization, viewing it as a bridge to China's modernization. He advocated for the simultaneous development of scientific research and science popularization, writing many scientifically rigorous and vivid science popularization articles, such as "Bridge Talk" and "Chinese Stone Arch Bridges." He also edited "A Small Collection of Natural Sciences," becoming a renowned science popularizer both domestically and internationally. He served as the vice chairman of the China Science Popularization Association, making important contributions to organizing and promoting China's science popularization creation. He particularly cared for the growth of young people, tirelessly guiding them to love science, learn science, and use science, dedicating themselves to China's scientific cause.

Comrade Mao Yisheng was a vigorous social activist. During his studies in the United States, he served as the vice chairman of the Chinese Students Association in America and, with Lu Ying and others, founded the Chinese Engineering Society in America. After liberation, he was one of the outstanding leaders of the China Democratic League (Jiusan Society), serving as the vice chairman and honorary chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League for a long time. He played a bridging role in uniting a broad group of scientific and technological workers and members of the China Democratic League around the Communist Party of China, promoting the relationship between the Party and intellectuals, and making important contributions to the progress and development of the China Democratic League. He also served as the president of the China Returned Scholars Association and the honorary president of the Tongji University Alumni Association, uniting overseas Chinese intellectuals to serve the Four Modernizations. During his tenure as a representative of the National People's Congress, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and a vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, he worked closely with the Communist Party of China, proposing many valuable suggestions for China's socialist revolution and construction and the development of China's scientific and technological cause. He led the Chinese scientific and technological delegation to visit Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, Italy, Switzerland, France, Portugal, Britain, Sweden, Japan, and the United States, strengthening China's scientific and technological exchanges with these countries, enhancing the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of these countries, and raising China's international prestige. He made many friends and worked in the Chinese community to promote unity and solidarity, often using the phrase "Patriotism has a door" to inspire overseas Chinese to contribute to China's Four Modernizations and the completion of China's reunification.

Comrade Mao Yisheng was a progressive patriot. He spent his life pursuing progress, transforming from a democrat who advocated "science to save the nation" and "engineering to save the nation" into a communist. Born at the end of the Qing Dynasty and growing up during the early Republic of China, he was in college when the Xinhai Revolution began and once prepared to join the army. Later, he heard Mr. Sun Yat-sen's speech: China's revolution needs a large army of armed struggle and a large army of national construction, and he decided to take the path of "science to save the nation." After obtaining his Ph.D. in the United States, he returned to his impoverished and chaotic motherland with the strong feeling of "my career is in China," diligently cultivating a batch of engineering and technical talents for the country. He oversaw the design and construction of the Qiantang River Bridge, breaking the monopoly of Western countries on the design and construction of large-scale modern bridges in China. When the Japanese invaders entered Hangzhou, the Qiantang River Bridge was about to fall into enemy hands, he assisted the military in blowing up the bridge he had built with his own hands, taking away all the relevant materials of the bridge to the rear, and in 1975, he personally donated these valuable materials to the state, playing an important role in the Four Modernizations. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he witnessed the Kuomintang reactionaries destroying democracy and launching a civil war, realizing that only the Chinese Communist Party leading the people to revolution could save China. Therefore, before the liberation of Shanghai, he refused to go to Taiwan and, according to the instructions of the underground organization of the Communist Party of China, he used his position as the secretary-general of the Shanghai Municipal Government to protect Shanghai's factories, institutions, and schools, and to protect the 300 progressive students imprisoned in Longhua Prison. In 1949, he was invited to go north to participate in the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, pledging to support the leadership of the Communist Party of China. He believed that the Communist Party of China is the chief architect of building a new China. During the ten years of turmoil, he remained steadfast in his belief in the Party and communism despite adversity. He wholeheartedly supported the correct line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, working vigorously. In 1987, he was honored to join the Communist Party of China, fulfilling his long-cherished wish. He said, "Joining the Communist Party of China is my long-held wish, which is the summary of my life's experience."

Comrade Mao Yisheng was a person of broad-mindedness, understanding of the big picture, and a willingness to take the initiative and help others. He had numerous students and friends. His life was rich and colorful, a life of a steadfast patriot, a life of a successful striver, a life of service to the people, and a life of transformation from a democrat to a communist.
