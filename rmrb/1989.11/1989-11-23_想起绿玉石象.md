Title: Remembering the Jade Elephant

In May 1988, I participated in the Chinese Writers Delegation's visit to the friendly neighboring country of Pakistan. After learning this news, I was always thinking about one thing: what gift should I give to my writer friends?

Of course, giving my own works is quite appropriate. Isn't it the works that best represent a writer? But at that time, I didn't have any books in Urdu. I could only bring along the Chinese version of "The Woman Who Does Not Want to Be Tattooed." Even if the recipients couldn't understand Chinese, it could at least serve as a memento.

What about other gifts? I chose two items: one was the green tea from Nan Nuo Mountain that my sister gave me when I was in Xishuangbanna during the Water-Splashing Festival; the other was ten small jade elephants carved in Kunming's Bird Language and Flower Fragrance Hall...

It was gratifying to see that my Pakistani writer friends loved and understood the Xishuangbanna green tea and jade elephants so much. Perhaps it was because the gifts were light but the sentiments were deep. After all, they came from the distant borders of China and from the hands of a guest who had beautiful feelings towards Pakistan.

Friends asked me, "Are there still elephants in China?"

I said, "Yes, in the forests of Xishuangbanna."

"May they live well."

With the efforts of the editors at the Foreign Languages Publishing House, my novel "The Boy Who Explores the Wonders in the Primitive Forest" about the close and friendly relationship between the wild elephants in the Xishuangbanna forest and the people was translated into Urdu and published. I was very happy about this. A Pakistani writer told me, "Pakistan once had elephants, many, many elephants... but with the destruction of the forest ecosystem, the elephants, disappeared, became extinct..."

I never expected that a year ago I gave jade elephants to my Pakistani friends, and today I could offer the elephants in my literary works. This is indeed a meaningful thing.

### 想起绿玉石象

　　想起绿玉石象
　　张昆华
      一九八八年五月，我参加中国作家代表团访问友好邻邦巴基斯坦。当我得知这一消息后，心里总是琢磨着一件事：送什么礼物给作家朋友们呢？
    当然，送自己的著作是比较适宜的。不正是作品最能说明作家自己么？但当时在我的著作中还没有乌尔都文的书。我只好带上中文版的《不愿纹面的女人》。虽然受赠者不一定能看懂中文，总可以作个纪念吧。
    别的礼物呢？我选择了两件：一是我在西双版纳过泼水节时，妹妹给我的采自南糯山的绿茶；二是我在昆明的鸟语花香的胜利堂前购买的十头绿玉雕琢的小象……
    值得欣慰的是，巴基斯坦作家朋友们对于版纳绿茶和绿玉石象是多么的喜爱和理解。也许是礼轻情义重吧。这毕竟来自遥远的中国边陲，又出自对巴基斯坦有着美好感情的客人之手。
    朋友们问我：“在中国，还有象吗？”
    我说：“有。在西双版纳的森林中。”
    “愿它们生活得很好。”
    在外文出版社编辑的努力下，我写西双版纳森林中的野象与人们的亲密友好关系的小说《在原始森林里探奇的少年》，翻译成乌尔都文出版了，我感到十分高兴。一位巴基斯坦作家对我说：“巴基斯坦曾经有过象，有过很多很多的象……但随着森林生态的破坏，象，消失了，灭绝了……”
    想不到一年前我向巴基斯坦朋友们赠送绿玉石象，而今天却能奉献文学作品中的象。这倒是很有意味的事。
      （此文是作者为外文出版社出版的中篇小说《在原始森林里探奇的少年》写的序言）
