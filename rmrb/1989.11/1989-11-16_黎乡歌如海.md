In the southern foothills of Wuzhishan on Hainan Island lies the Baoting Li and Miao Autonomous County, truly a "land of songs." As soon as one steps into this "song village," one can hear clear and pleasant Li songs everywhere. Young women sing Li songs in the lush rubber forests; grandfathers and grandmothers sing and guess songs in new tiled houses shaded by betel nut trees; and the fields and villages often echo with melodious singing.

The Li people are a singing and dancing ethnic group, and singing folk songs is a traditional cultural activity of the Li people in Baoting. Everyone, young and old, is a folk singer. Baoting Li folk songs come in various forms, including duets, guessing songs, solo performances, and group singing, all rich in ethnic flavor. During the war years, the troops stationed here used Li folk songs to propagate revolutionary ideas to the masses and inspire the fighting spirit of the Li people. After liberation, the Party and the government paid great attention to the construction of this remote area, establishing schools, building roads, and constructing reservoirs. The lives of the Li people have been improving day by day. In recent years, under the Party's policy of enriching the people, while focusing on grain production, the Li people in Baoting have vigorously developed tropical economic crops, mainly rubber. Now, the county's private rubber plantations have expanded to 130,000 mu, producing 1,600 tons of dry rubber annually. The once impoverished mountains have now become prosperous new Li villages. People's hearts are content, and they sing songs when they are happy. If they drink a few cups of mountain rice wine, the songs will flow even more. In San Dao Town's Shou Gong Village, the elderly folk singer Ji Wei Lian is known as the "song fairy." She can sing hundreds of different folk songs spontaneously. She once participated in the county's song competition and won first prize. Someone praised her for having a belly full of songs, and she laughed and sang:

	"Four lines of song in my heart, tap the bamboo tube to make tens of thousands,
		Thousands and tens of thousands of songs like the sea, singing for three years is not enough."

Many Li ethnic leaders are also folk singers. Take Yang Wengui, the former county committee secretary and current vice chairman of the Hainan Provincial People's Congress, for example. When he speaks at meetings, he often hums a few Li songs as an introduction; when he goes to Li villages to work, he also sings and guesses songs with the masses. He has also written many new folk songs that have been published in newspapers. During the civilized and polite month activities, his new folk songs "Singing the New Civilized Customs" and "Li and Han are One Family" are widely sung in Baoting Li villages. Lin Hongzhen, the town mayor of Shiling Town and a Li ethnic official, is an old folk singer who can sing spontaneously. When guests come to his home, he greets them by singing a few Li songs. Truly, "In the land of songs, the songs are like the sea, joy and laughter fill the Li villages, singing the Party's good policies, happiness comes to every village and hamlet."

    黎乡歌如海
    陈海川  莫壮衡  唐辉
    海南岛五指山南麓的保亭黎族苗族自治县，不愧为“民歌之乡”。一踏进“歌乡”，到处都可以听到清脆悦耳的黎歌。姑娘们在翠绿欲滴的橡胶林里唱黎歌；阿公阿妈在槟榔树掩映的新瓦房里对歌、猜歌；村边田头也不时飞来委婉动听的歌声。
    黎族是个能歌善舞的民族，唱民歌是保亭黎族人民的传统文化活动，男女老少个个都是民歌手。保亭黎族民歌形式多样，有对歌、猜歌、独唱、合唱，民族风味十分浓郁。在战争年代，活动在这里的琼崖纵队曾用黎族民歌向群众宣传革命的道理，激励黎族同胞的斗志。解放后，党和政府非常关怀这个边远地区的建设，办起了学校，筑起了公路，建起了水库，黎族人民的生活一天比一天好起来。近几年来，保亭黎族人民在党的富民政策鼓舞下，在抓好粮食生产的同时，大力发展以橡胶为主的热带经济作物，现在，全县民营橡胶已发展到十三万亩，年产干胶一千六百吨。过去的穷山沟，如今变成了富饶的新黎寨。人们心情舒畅，高兴起来就编歌唱歌，要是饮上几口山兰米酒，那歌仔就更多。三道镇首弓村老民歌手吉味莲，被人们称为“歌仙”，她能随编随唱，一下子唱三四百首内容不同的民歌。她曾参加县里的赛歌会，获得了一等奖。有人赞她满肚子都是歌，她笑着唱道：
    “四句歌仔在心间，敲敲竹筒出几万，
      千支万首歌如海，一唱三年唱不完。”
    不少黎族领导干部也是民歌手，就拿原县委书记、现任海南省人大副主任的黎族干部杨文贵来说吧，他在大会上讲话时，总爱哼几句黎歌做引子；下黎村去工作时，也和群众一起猜歌、对歌。他还编写了不少新民歌，在报刊上发表。在开展文明礼貌月活动中，他编写的《歌唱文明新风尚》、《黎汉一家亲》等新民歌，在保亭黎村广为传唱。什玲镇镇长、黎族干部林宏真是位出口成歌的老民歌手。家里来了客人，一见面他就唱几句黎歌表示欢迎。真个是：“黎歌之乡歌如海，欢声笑语满黎寨，
      歌唱党的政策好，村村寨寨幸福来。”
