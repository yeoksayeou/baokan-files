Title: In Memory of Norman Bethune

Comrade Norman Bethune was a member of the Communist Party of Canada. Over 50 years old, he came to China at the behest of the Communist Party of Canada and the Communist Party of the United States to aid in the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan. He arrived in Yan'an last spring and later went to work in the Wutai Mountains. Unfortunately, he sacrificed his life in the line of duty. A foreigner, with no personal gain in mind, regarded the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause. What kind of spirit is this? This is the spirit of internationalism, the spirit of communism. Every member of the Communist Party of China must learn from this spirit. According to Leninism, the proletariat of capitalist countries must support the liberation struggles of the peoples of colonial and semi-colonial countries, and the proletariat of colonial and semi-colonial countries must support the liberation struggles of the proletariat of capitalist countries. Only then can the world revolution be victorious. Comrade Norman Bethune put this Leninist line into practice. We Chinese Communists must also put this line into practice. We must unite with the proletariat of all capitalist countries, with the proletariat of Japan, Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy, and all capitalist countries, to overthrow imperialism and liberate our nation and people, and the nations and peoples of the world. This is our internationalism, the internationalism with which we oppose narrow nationalism and narrow patriotism.

Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessness and dedication to the people is evident in his extreme sense of responsibility to his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people. Every Communist must learn from him. Many people are irresponsible in their work, shirking heavy tasks and passing them on to others, while taking on the light ones. When faced with a task, they first think of themselves and then of others. After doing a little, they think they have done a lot, boasting about it and fearing that others might not know. Toward their comrades and the people, they are not full of enthusiasm but cold and indifferent, apathetic and unfeeling. Such people are not Communists, or at least not pure Communists. Those who have returned from the front lines all speak highly of Norman Bethune, and none fail to be moved by his spirit. The military and civilian population of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, all those who have personally received treatment from Dr. Norman Bethune or seen his work, are deeply moved. Every Communist must learn from Comrade Norman Bethune's true communist spirit.

Comrade Norman Bethune was a doctor. He took medicine as his profession and pursued technical excellence. Within the entire Eighth Route Army medical system, his medical skills were very high. This is a good lesson for those who are fickle and those who look down on technical work, thinking it is insignificant and has no future.

I only met Comrade Norman Bethune once. Later, he wrote to me several times. But because I was busy, I only replied to him once, and I don't know if he received it. I am very saddened by his death. Now that everyone is remembering him, it shows how deeply his spirit has moved people. We must all learn from his selfless spirit. From this point of view, one can become a person of great benefit to the people. A person's abilities may be great or small, but as long as they have this spirit, they are a noble person, a pure person, a person of morality, a person who has risen above petty interests, and a person of benefit to the people.

    纪念白求恩
   （一九三九年十二月二十一日）
    毛泽东
    白求恩同志①是加拿大共产党员，五十多岁了，为了帮助中国的抗日战争，受加拿大共产党和美国共产党的派遣，不远万里，来到中国。去年春上到延安，后来到五台山工作，不幸以身殉职。一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神？这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神，每一个中国共产党员都要学习这种精神。列宁主义认为：资本主义国家的无产阶级要拥护殖民地半殖民地人民的解放斗争，殖民地半殖民地的无产阶级要拥护资本主义国家的无产阶级的解放斗争，世界革命才能胜利②。白求恩同志是实践了这一条列宁主义路线的。我们中国共产党员也要实践这一条路线。我们要和一切资本主义国家的无产阶级联合起来，要和日本的、英国的、美国的、德国的、意大利的以及一切资本主义国家的无产阶级联合起来，才能打倒帝国主义，解放我们的民族和人民，解放世界的民族和人民。这就是我们的国际主义，这就是我们用以反对狭隘民族主义和狭隘爱国主义的国际主义。
    白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他。不少的人对工作不负责任，拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的。一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算。出了一点力就觉得了不起，喜欢自吹，生怕人家不知道。对同志对人民不是满腔热忱，而是冷冷清清，漠不关心，麻木不仁。这种人其实不是共产党员，至少不能算一个纯粹的共产党员。从前线回来的人说到白求恩，没有一个不佩服，没有一个不为他的精神所感动。晋察冀边区的军民，凡亲身受过白求恩医生的治疗和亲眼看过白求恩医生的工作的，无不为之感动。每一个共产党员，一定要学
  习白求恩同志的这种真正共产主义者的精神。
    白求恩同志是个医生，他以医疗为职业，对技术精益求精；在整个八路军医务系统中，他的医术是很高明的。这对于一班见异思迁的人，对于一班鄙薄技术工作以为不足道、以为无出路的人，也是一个极好的教训。
    我和白求恩同志只见过一面。后来他给我来过许多信。可是因为忙，仅回过他一封信，还不知他收到没有。对于他的死，我是很悲痛的。现在大家纪念他，可见他的精神感人之深。我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。〔注释〕
