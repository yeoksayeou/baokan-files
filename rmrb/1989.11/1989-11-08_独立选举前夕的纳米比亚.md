With the approach of November 7, the election day, Namibia—the last remaining colony on the African continent—has made all preparations to step towards independence after 700,000 voters freely elect 72 representatives.

South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha arrived here on November 4, clarifying rumors that the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) was amassing troops on the border, and extended an apology to SWAPO Chairman Sam Nujoma. He returned to South Africa late that night, expressing his belief that Namibia would hold a free and fair independence election.

Following a false alarm, various political parties in Namibia have been busy preparing or holding rallies over the weekend to make a final push for more votes. Windhoek and the rest of the country have presented a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere.

In the prime-time slot following the evening news, SWAPO Chairman Sam Nujoma and the leader of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), Moses Katjongua, once again expounded on their respective party policies and made a final appeal to voters to cast their ballots for them. The South West Africa Broadcasting Corporation, controlled by the South African government and criticized for its biased reporting, has changed its tune, agreeing to allow the 10 registered parties to issue their election statements through the media. It will also hold a special forum tonight, allowing representatives from the 10 parties to answer three identical questions, enabling television viewers to make their final judgments and choices before voting.

In the streets of the capital Windhoek and even in remote rural areas, slogans printed by the United Nations Transition Assistance Group for the election are everywhere, such as "Vote for Namibia," "Your vote in a free and fair election," "Your vote is secret," "We vote for peace," and "Vote without fear." Each party also posts its own slogans and distributes campaign pamphlets, advocating for a mixed economy or a free market economy, and pledging to provide better living conditions, housing, and education for the people.

Hundreds of foreign journalists and observers have flocked to the scene, filling up hotels in Windhoek, with some having to stay in expensive private homes. They shuttle between press conferences held by the United Nations assistance team and various political parties, busily sending back news to their readers about events in this remote corner of the world.

The bloody conflicts between supporters of competing parties that occurred in late September and early October have significantly decreased. In the past month, there have been no serious conflicts in areas where various parties previously held rallies. These encouraging signs indicate that all Namibians, including blacks, whites, and people of mixed race, hope that their country will achieve independence under the supervision of the United Nations through free and fair elections.

Namibia has entered the final crucial stage of realizing its long-held dream of independence.

### 独立选举前夕的纳米比亚

    独立选举前夕的纳米比亚
    新华社记者　熊仲琪
    随着11月7日选举日的来临，纳米比亚——非洲大陆上的最后一块殖民地已经一切就绪，准备在70万选民自由地选举72名议员后步向独立。
    南非外长皮克·博塔4日抵达这里，澄清了南非关于西南非洲人民组织（以下简称人组）正在边境集结部队的谣言，并向人组主席努乔马致以歉意；他在当日深夜返回南非，并表示相信纳米比亚将举行一次自由、公正的独立选举。
    经过一场虚惊之后，纳米比亚各政党都纷纷准备，或已在周末举行集会，为争取更多的选票作最后一次努力。温得和克以及全国上下都呈现出和平、宁静的气象。
    在昨晚电视新闻后的黄金时间中，人组主席努乔马和民族爱国阵线（民阵）领导人摩西·卡吉翁瓜再次阐述各自政党的政策后，发出了最后呼吁，要求选民投他们的票。被南非政府控制、并因其偏见报道而遭指责的西南非洲广播公司也易弦更辙，同意让10个已登记的党派都通过宣传媒介发表各自的竞选声明，并将在明晚举行最后一次特别论坛，允许10个党派的代表分别就3个相同的问题作出各自的回答，以便使电视观众在投票前作出最后的判断和选择。
    在首都温得和克街头甚至在偏僻的乡村，联合国过渡时期援助团为选举而专门印制的标语随处可见，诸如“你为纳米比亚投票”、“在自由、公正选举中的一票”、“你的投票是保密的”、“我们为和平而投票”以及“投票不必恐惧”。而各党派为招徕选票还到处张贴出自己的标语，并纷纷散发竞选小册子，宣传各自倡导的混合经济或自由市场经济，并信誓旦旦，将为人民提供更好的生活、住房和教育条件。
    数百名外国新闻记者和观察团，蜂拥而至，一时温得和克旅店爆满，有的只好住在房租高昂的私宅中。他们在联合国援助团和各政党举办的记者招待会中来回穿梭，紧张地为其读者发回在世界这个遥远一角上发生的新闻。
    在9月下旬和10月上旬曾发生一些竞选政党支持者间的流血冲突现已明显减少。近一个月来，在先前各政党纷纷集会的地区再没有发生严重冲突。这些令人鼓舞的迹象表明所有纳米比亚人，包括黑人、白人和有色人，都希望自己的国家在联合国的监督下，通过自由与公立。
    纳米比亚已进入实现其多年梦想、取得独立的最后关键阶段。
