Observation Post

In late July, relevant departments in our county conducted a re-examination of 2,160 family planning surgery recipients from eight townships based on public reports. They discovered 281 fake male sterilization certificates, accounting for 13% of the total male sterilization surgeries. These fake certificates were issued by more than 20 hospitals in Yangliu District, Qinqiao Township of our county, Wentang Township, Dongtou Township of Xinning County, Yanglin Township of Dongkou County, and Longhui County, Chengbu County. The hospitals that issued the most fake certificates include Qinqiao Township Hospital (44 certificates), Yangliu District Hospital (26 certificates), Dongtou Township Hospital (29 certificates), and Wentang Township Hospital (14 certificates). Preliminary investigations revealed that the directors of Yangliu District Hospital, Xiao Huazhong, and Qinqiao Township Hospital, He Xiuzhi, issued over 120 fake sterilization certificates and extorted more than 3,000 yuan in bribes.

A large number of fake surgery certificates have provided convenience for those who exceed the birth limit, leading to a significant number of individuals with fake certificates having three or four children, severely impacting the implementation of family planning. Even more infuriating is the discovery that 18 state officials abused their power to obtain fake sterilization certificates for themselves and their relatives, including nine county, district, and township cadres.

    竟有假绝育手术证
    七月下旬，我县有关部门根据群众举报，对八个乡镇的二千一百六十名计划生育受术人员进行了复检发现，假男性结扎证明二百八十一份，占男性结扎手术总数的百分之十三。这些假结扎证明分别出自我县的杨柳区、秦桥乡，新宁县的温塘乡、洞头乡，洞口县的杨林乡和隆回县、城步县的二十多家医院，其中开假证明最多的有秦桥乡医院（四十四份）、杨柳区医院（二十六份）、洞头乡医院（二十九份）、温塘乡医院（十四份）。据初步查证，杨柳区医院院长肖化忠、秦桥乡医院院长何修之，两人就开出假结扎证明一百二十多份，索取贿赂三千多元。
    大批假手术证明给超生者开了方便之门，已有为数不少的持假证明者超生了三胎、四胎，严重影响了计划生育工作的开展。更令人气愤的是，还查出十八名国家工作人员利用职权为自己和亲属索取了假结扎证，其中有九人是县、区、乡干部。
