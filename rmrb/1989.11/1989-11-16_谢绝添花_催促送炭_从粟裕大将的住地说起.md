Time flies so quickly. It has already been five years since Comrade Shu Yu left us! The photograph of his body draped with the party flag, taken by his youngest son Xiaobao, and the photograph of his wife, Comrade Chu Qing, and us together under his portrait, are placed under the glass on my desk, appearing before my eyes every morning and evening.

The photographs were taken at Shu Yu's residence. Seeing the photographs naturally reminds me of his residence.

Because of my work, I have often visited Shu Yu's residence.

The first time I visited General Shu Yu's residence, I couldn't help but feel a bit surprised: the office (also used as a study), dining room, and bedroom were all connected in a row, arranged in small square-shaped buildings. The reception area was connected to these "small squares" but protruded outward like a pavilion. There were some flowers inside the rooms and some trees outside, but it was far from the "twisting paths leading to secluded places" of a grand mansion. There were no rockeries or ponds, no spacious, bright, luxurious living rooms, dining rooms, studies, or bedrooms. Moreover, there were no antique or modern items that could be considered luxurious or decorative. Everything seen was ordinary and common, all of which made one feel the owner's frugality and simplicity. Even his wife, children (including the third generation), and the staff around him, due to his long-term teachings, all had a candid and simple style.

After learning more, I found out that General Shu Yu's residence was originally a small courtyard (backyard) for temporary living. Later, a well-renovated, high-quality mansion was allocated to him, but he refused, insisting on not moving. He said that the temporary small courtyard was already "sufficient," "very good," and there was "no need to trouble the people and waste money to change the house." The management department urged him to move into the new mansion, but he suggested that the new mansion be allocated to those who truly needed it. Thus, each side had their own reasons, and after many rounds of discussion, the result was that General Shu Yu gave up the larger, more spacious, and better-equipped new mansion to others, while his family continued to live in the smaller, less spacious, and less well-equipped old courtyard.

General Shu Yu's study (also used as an office) and dining room and bedroom were all divided from an original long corridor, so they appeared in square shapes and were connected in a row; the reception area was originally a pavilion, with bricks laid around it and glass windows installed, making it a "reception room," actually a "reception pavilion." Don't underestimate this unassuming "reception pavilion"; General Shu Yu received many brave generals and famous scholars here during his lifetime, as well as leaders of the party and the state. The staff around General Shu Yu said: The management department had long planned to arrange for the renovation of the leader's residence, but the leader firmly opposed "adding flowers to brocade" and delayed it. Until that year when an earthquake occurred, for safety reasons, he had to agree to the renovation, but he repeatedly emphasized that the focus should only be on "safety," not allowing the pursuit of "comfort" and "appearance."

General Shu Yu often said: "A person, especially a revolutionary soldier, must not be conservative in thought; one must keep up with the development of the situation and the pace of the times. However, the house one lives in can be a bit old; as long as it doesn't leak or let in the wind, it's fine! The country is still far from being built, and the people are not yet rich. You should go and see the living conditions of the people in Beijing... Compared to them, compared to the majority of people, compared to the common people, our living conditions are indeed already good enough!"

Once, the staff at the residence, according to the arrangements of the management department's leaders, began preparations for renovating the residence without consulting General Shu Yu. When he found out, he was unhappy and said excitedly: "I really don't understand—why must you insist on adding flowers to brocade? Why can't you do more to send charcoal in the snow?"

General Shu Yu dedicated his life to the revolution, working tirelessly for the people, enduring countless battles and hardships, achieving great merits, and becoming famous both domestically and internationally. However, he never boasted of his achievements or position. His broad mind was filled with the cause of the party, the construction of the army, the prosperity of the country, the sufferings of the people, and the great ideal of communism! This spirit, in today's anti-corruption construction, is truly thought-provoking!

    谢绝添花　催促送炭
    ——从粟裕大将的住地说起
    吕韧敏
    时光过得真快，转眼粟裕同志已经离开我们五年了！他的幼子小宝拍摄的党旗覆盖着他的遗体的照片，他的夫人楚青同志与我们一起在他的遗像下的合影，就放在我的案头玻璃板下，朝朝暮暮时现眼底。
    照片是在粟裕同志住地拍摄的。看到照片，自然就想到他的住地。
    因为工作的关系，我曾多次出入于粟裕同志的住地。
    初到粟裕大将的住地，不免使人感到有点奇怪：办公（兼作书房）、吃饭和睡觉的地方，竟是联在一起、摆在一条平行线上的一个个小方块形建筑，而会客的地方，都是与上述“小方块”相联结而突然鼓出来像个亭子似的大圆筒形建筑。室内有些花草，室外有些树木，却远不是那种“曲径通幽”的深宅大院。既没有假山碧池，也没有阔大、敞亮、富丽堂皇的客厅、餐厅、书房和居室。而且室内也没有古代的或现代的可以称之为奢侈品和装饰品的各种摆设。所见到的东西都普普通通，平平常常，无不令人感受到主人的廉俭无华。就连他的夫人、孩子（包括第三代）和身边工作人员，也由于他的长期言传身教而均具坦诚、质朴的风格。
    经过了解，我才知道，粟裕大将的住地，本是给他暂住的一座宅院的陪房（后院）。后来，分配了一座整修一新的上好宅院给他，但是他不要，坚决不要，说是暂住的陪房已经“足够了”，“很好了”，“完全没有必要劳民伤财换房子”。管理部门动员他迁入新宅院，他建议把新宅院分配给真正需要的人。这样，各说各的道理，来来去去经过了不少回合，结果还是粟裕同志把面积大、房间多、地理位置和装修设备都好得多的新宅院让给了别人，而自己一家人一直住这面积较小、房间较少、设备较差的旧陪房。
    粟裕同志的书房（兼作办公室）和餐室、寝室，都是在原先的一条长廊上依势一一隔开而成的，所以才呈方块型且联结在一起摆在一条平行线上；那个会客的地方，原先就是一个亭子，依势在四周围砌上砖，再安上玻璃窗，就俨然成为一个
  “客厅”，实为“客亭”。可别小看这个不起眼的
  “客亭”，粟裕同志生前在这里接待过不少骁勇的战将和著名的文人，还接待过党和国家的领导人。粟裕同志身边工作人员说：管理部门早就有计划安排维修首长住地，但首长坚决反对搞“锦上添花”，而一直拖了下来。直到那年发生了地震，为了安全不得不同意维修了，但又再三强调，着眼点仅限于“安全”，决不允许追求“舒适”和“观瞻”。
    粟裕同志常说：“一个人，特别是一个革命军人，思想是不能守旧的，一定要跟上形势的发展，跟上时代的步伐；但是住的房子，旧一点是没有什么大不了的，不透风不漏雨就行了嘛！国家还远没有建设好，人民还并不富裕，你们去看一看北京市民的居住条件……跟他们比一比，跟大多数人比一比，跟老百姓比一比，我们这些人的居住条件确实是已经够好的了！”
    有一次，住地工作人员根据管理部门领导的布置，没有请示粟裕同志就开始了维修住地的准备工作，他知道后不高兴了，不无激动地说：“我实在弄不明白——为什么一定要来搞锦上添花呢？为什么不能去多搞一点雪里送炭呢？”
    粟裕同志为革命出生入死，为人民鞠躬尽瘁，枪林弹雨戎马一生，功勋卓著，驰名中外；但是他从不居功矜位，他的博大的胸襟中，装的是党的事业，军队的建设，国家的兴旺，人民的疾苦，装的是远大的共产主义理想！这种精神，在廉政建设的今天，岂不发人深思！
