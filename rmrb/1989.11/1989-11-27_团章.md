Title: The Party Constitution

I can never forget an incident that happened over thirty years ago. It was shortly after the founding of New China, when I had just started wearing a red scarf. A family moved into the east room of our courtyard: an elderly couple with two young children. The elderly were old, and the children were young. Grandpa Cao had a disability in his legs, making it difficult for him to walk, with a noticeable limp.

That winter, a young man in his twenties came to their home. He was thin, of medium height, and dressed in military uniform.

"He is my big brother," the younger brother happily told me.

Oh, so they were a military family. This big brother rarely went out, and I only saw his back. I never heard him speak loudly. Only the two elderly people were busy and cheerful.

Happy days pass quickly. It seemed like only a few days before the big brother returned to his unit. After he left, a blue enamel sign with a yellow five-star emblem and the words "Honorable Military Family" appeared on the doorstep of our courtyard. This was the government's recognition of revolutionary military families. When Grandpa Cao nailed up the sign, we all ran out to watch.

The following year, on a warm yet chilly afternoon, a guest came to the Cao family. Suddenly, we heard Grandma Cao's heart-wrenching cry, "Child, you can't leave!" Then, there was silence. The entire courtyard was shocked.

"Grandma! Grandma!"

"Mom, wake up! Wake up!"

After a while, we heard Grandma Cao's crying again. People's hearts tightened, and the entire courtyard fell silent, no one daring to voice their guesses...

Soon, many people came to their house. The east room was filled with weeping, and Grandma Cao fainted several times. People's guesses were correct; indeed, the big brother had sacrificed himself. In a battle in Korea, he gave his young life for the neighboring three thousand miles of our country.

The elderly parents never saw their son again, only his belongings—a small box containing a white mask and a red-covered party constitution.

I have seen countless red-covered party constitutions in bookstores and in people's hands, but the one in that small box has stayed with me for over thirty years. Although I don't know if this young soldier had joined the party, he fulfilled the duties of a Young Pioneer, and he truly dedicated everything to the people.

Later, a new sign was hung on our courtyard gate, still with a deep blue background, but the yellow five-star was changed to a red five-star, and "Honorable Military Family" was changed to "Honorable Martyr's Family."

    我总也不能忘记三十多年前的一件事。那是在新中国刚成立不久，我才戴上红领巾的日子，我院东屋搬来了曹大爷一家人：老夫妇俩带了一双小儿女。老的老，小的小，曹大爷的腿上还有残疾，走起路来一跛一跛的，很不方便。
    这年冬天，他家来了一个二十岁左右的年轻人，瘦瘦的，中等身量，一身戎装。
      “他是我大哥哥。”那小弟弟高兴地对我说。
    噢，原来他家是军属。这位大哥哥不常出屋门，我只见过他一个背影，从听不见他高声说话。只有两位老人欢天喜地地忙。
    欢乐的日子总是过得最快，仿佛只有几天，大哥哥就回部队了。他走之后，我院大门的上门槛上，便多了一个搪瓷的圆牌，蓝底，中间一个黄色的五星，上面写着“光荣军属”四个字。这是人民政府对革命军属的表彰。曹大爷钉这牌牌时，我们都跑出来看。
    转过年，乍暖还寒的一个午后，曹家来了客人。不知怎的，突然听见曹大妈撕心裂肺的一声痛哭：“孩子，你可不能走啊！”之后，便没了声息。全院的邻居都惊呆了。
      “大娘！大娘！”
      “孩子妈，你醒一醒！你醒醒！”
    半响，才又听见曹大妈的哭声。人们的心揪紧了，整个院子顿时沉寂了，谁也不愿说出自己的猜测……
    不多一会儿，他家来了很多人，东屋里哭成一团，曹大妈又几次昏厥过去。人们没有猜错，果然是大哥哥牺牲了。在朝鲜前线的一次空战中，他把自己年轻的生命溶进了毗邻的三千里江山。
    年老的双亲再也没能看到儿子的身影，眼前只有儿子的遗物——一只小箱子，里面放着一个白色的口罩和一本红皮的团章。
    红皮团章，在书店里，在人们手中，我曾见到过千百回，千百册，然而，唯有这只小箱子里的团章，三十多年来，我从未忘怀。虽然，不知道这位年轻的战士是否已经入团，但是，他尽了一个共青团员应尽的职责，他确确实实把自己的一切都献给了人民。
    我院大门上，后来换上了一个新牌牌，依旧是像大海一样湛蓝的底色，只是把那黄五星换成了红色的五星，把
  “光荣军属”改成了“光荣烈属”。
