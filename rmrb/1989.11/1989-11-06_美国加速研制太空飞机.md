The United States is currently accelerating the development of hypersonic aircraft that can freely travel between Earth and space. Significant technological progress has been made. According to the *New York Times*, if financial and other technical obstacles can be overcome, the first spaceplane could take off in 1997, leading the Soviet Union, Western Europe, and Japan by 3 to 5 years.

According to the design requirements, this spaceplane can take off and land at ground airports like ordinary aircraft, breaking through Earth's gravity at a speed of over 2.7 million kilometers per hour (25 times the speed of sound) and completing one orbit around Earth in just 90 minutes. The spaceplane serves both military and civilian purposes. It can launch satellites or other payloads into Earth's orbit, shuttle between ground and space stations, and carry bombs to penetrate enemy territory at intercontinental ballistic missile speeds. Compared to the Space Shuttle, although the spaceplane's payload volume is only about half of the former, its takeoff weight is only 1/10 of the Space Shuttle's launch weight; the maintenance personnel can be reduced from 15,000 to 100, making it more cost-effective.

Currently, the technological breakthroughs in spaceplane development include:

	* A new type of material that can withstand temperatures up to 1600 degrees Celsius has been developed, protecting the aircraft's top from high-temperature damage during re-entry into the atmosphere. Additionally, General Dynamics is developing another type of high-temperature-resistant carbon-carbon coating.
	* High-temperature, lightweight titanium alloy sheets that can cover the aircraft's exterior. Lockheed International has produced over 700 kilograms of titanium-aluminum alloy in the past six months, and McDonnell Douglas is developing another new material based on titanium.
	* Five companies are using new supercomputers to simulate the operation of air compressors during hypersonic flight. For components that cannot be tested in existing wind tunnels, significant progress has been made through computer simulations. The world's fastest wind tunnel, built by Lockheed, will be completed next year in California.
	* Scientists have designed a special engine that can intake oxygen in the upper atmosphere—supersonic combustion ramjet engines—and studied the chemical changes in the atmosphere during hypersonic flight that affect the aircraft. Engineers involved in the project say that with these advancements, they are close to a "major technological leap" in manufacturing practical spaceplanes.

Despite these advancements, spaceplanes still face several technical challenges. The main issues are: first, it is impossible to simulate all the complex conditions of space flight on the ground; second, it is impossible to fully test the operation of this special engine in a wind tunnel to produce hypersonic thrust, meaning that untested jet engines must be used. This is unprecedented in the history of aircraft manufacturing.

Currently, this project is behind the original schedule, and the budget has significantly exceeded the initial estimates. The design and key component development of the aircraft began in 1986, with an initial budget of $4 billion, and the first test flight was scheduled for 1993.

Now, the expenditure has exceeded $2 billion, and an additional $5 billion is estimated to be needed until the first flight. The U.S. authorities hope to select one of the five design schemes next year and begin manufacturing two prototype aircraft.

    美国加速研制太空飞机
    本报记者　仓立德
    美国科学家和工程师目前正在加速研制可自由往返于地球和太空之间的特超音速飞机，并在技术上取得了不少进展。据《纽约时报》透露，如能克服资金及其他技术障碍，首架太空飞机将于1997年升空，比苏联、西欧、日本的同类飞机领先3至5年。
    按照设计要求，这种太空飞机与普通飞机一样能在地面机场起降，以每小时2.7万多公里（即25倍于音速）的速度冲破地球的引力，环绕地球一圈只需90分钟。太空飞机兼具军事、民用两种功能。它能将卫星或其他载荷送入地球轨道，可在地面与空间站之间穿梭飞行，也能携带炸弹，以洲际导弹的速度深入敌方领土。与航天飞机相比，虽然太空飞机的载重体积只及前者的一半左右，但起飞重量仅为航天飞机发射重量的1／10；维修人员可由前者的1.5万名减至100名，因此费用较廉。
    目前，太空飞机在技术上的重要突破是：
    ——可耐1600摄氏度高温的新型材料已经研制成功，可保护飞机顶端在往返大气层时免遭高温损伤。此外，通用动力公司正在研制另一种新型碳—碳耐高温涂层。
    ——可覆盖机身外层的高温度轻质钛合金薄片。洛克维尔国际公司已在过去6个月中，生产出700多公斤钛铝合金，麦道公司也在发展另一种以钛为基础的新材料。
    ——5家公司运用新型超级电脑，测算了空气压缩机在超高速飞行时的工作情形；在现有大部风洞中均无法实验的一些部件，用电脑模拟也取得很大进展。由洛克维尔公司承建的世界最高速风洞将于明年在加州竣工。
    另外，有关科学家已设计出可在大气层上部吸入氧气的特殊发动机——超音速燃烧冲压式发动机，并研究了在特超音速飞行时大气层化学变化对飞机的影响。参与这项计划的工程师说，有了上述进展，他们在制造实用太空飞机方面已接近一个“大的技术跃进”。
    尽管如此，太空飞机在技术上仍面临不少难题。主要为：一是在地面无法模拟飞机在太空飞行的所有复杂条件；二是无法在风洞中全面实验这种特殊发动机在产生特超音速推力时的工作状况，也就是说，只能使用未经充分地面实验的喷气发动机。这在飞机制造史上还是头一回。
    目前这项计划已落后于原定时间表，预算也大大超过。飞机设计和主要部件研制起步于1986年，当时总预算为40亿美元，首次试验飞行定于1993年。
    现在耗资已超过20亿美元，至首次飞行估计还需50亿美元。美国当局希望能于明年在5种设计方案中选定1种，着手制造两架试验用飞机。
