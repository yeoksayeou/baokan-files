The International Support and Supervision Committee today invited the Nicaraguan government and the anti-government armed forces to hold direct talks at the United Nations headquarters on November 6 and 7, aiming to resume the peace process in Central America.

The committee stated in a declaration today that the reason for issuing the invitation for talks is due to the recent breakdown of the ceasefire in Nicaragua, which has led to increased tensions in Central America. It is also in accordance with the provisions of the "Esquipulas Accords" that within 90 days of the establishment of the committee, the Nicaraguan government and the committee should engage in direct contact with the anti-government armed forces in Nicaragua.

The International Support and Supervision Committee was established based on an agreement reached by the heads of state of five Central American countries in August this year. Its members include the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States, with the aim of supervising the implementation of the joint plan to disarm the anti-government forces in Nicaragua. Currently, the execution of this plan has been hindered.

The committee urges both parties in Nicaragua to accept this invitation. The Nicaraguan government had proposed holding direct talks in a statement on November 1. According to a spokesperson for the United Nations, the anti-government armed forces have also expressed their willingness to accept the invitation in principle, but they have requested to first review the negotiation agenda proposed by the committee.

Xinhua News Agency, Managua, November 4th.

The Nicaraguan Ministry of Defense announced on November 4th that since the Nicaraguan government declared a unilateral ceasefire on November 1st, in recent conflicts, the government forces have killed at least 7 anti-government armed forces and wounded 2 anti-government leaders.

A statement from the Ministry of Defense pointed out that these individuals were killed or wounded in three conflicts in the northern provinces of Nicaragua, Nueva Segovia, and Jinotega, which border Honduras.

    国际支持与监督委员会
    邀请尼双方在联合国直接会谈
    尼加拉瓜双方冲突再起
    本报联合国11月3日电　记者刘开宸报道：国际支持与监督委员会今天邀请尼加拉瓜政府与反政府武装于本月6、7日在联合国总部举行直接会谈，以便恢复中美洲和平进程。
    委员会在今天的声明中表示它所以发出会谈邀请，是由于尼停火最近破裂而产生的中美洲紧张局势，也是根据《特拉协定》关于在委员会成立后的90天内，尼政府和委员会将与尼反政府武装进行直接接触的规定。
    国际支持与监督委员会是根据中美洲5国首脑今年8月协议建立的组织，成员包括联合国和美洲国家组织秘书长，旨在监督执行迁散尼反政府武装的共同计划。现在，此计划的执行受阻。
    委员会呼吁尼双方接受此项邀请。尼政府曾在1日公报中提出举行直接会谈的建议。据联合国发言人说，尼反政府武装也已原则上表示接受邀请，只是要求先看一看委员会提出的谈判议程。
    新华社马那瓜11月4日电　尼加拉瓜国防部4日宣布，自从11月1日尼政府宣布中止单方面停火以来，在最近发生的一些冲突中，政府军至少击毙了7名反政府武装分子，打伤了2名反政府武装领导人。
    尼国防部一份公报指出，这些人是在同洪都拉斯接壤的尼北部新塞哥维亚省和希诺特加省的3次冲突中伤亡的。
