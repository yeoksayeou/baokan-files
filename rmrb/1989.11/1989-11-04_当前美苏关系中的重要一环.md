Following the announcement in late September this year that U.S. President Bush and Soviet President Gorbachev would hold a formal summit meeting in the United States next spring or summer, it was announced on October 31 that the two leaders would also hold an "informal" summit meeting on December 2-3. In the span of about half a year, the U.S. and the Soviet Union will hold two high-level meetings, which is undoubtedly a major event in current U.S.-Soviet relations. While next year's summit meeting is somewhat expected, the reason for holding this informal meeting has become the focus of attention.

According to the official explanation from the United States, the difference between the two summit meetings is that next year's formal meeting will focus on five major agendas in U.S.-Soviet relations, including arms control and regional conflicts. The two sides hope that after a few months of preparation, they can reach agreements in some areas. The December informal meeting, however, has no set agenda and is intended for a broad exchange of views on the current international situation and the development of U.S.-Soviet relations, so that the two leaders can better understand each other's views.

From the analysis of various parties here, the main factors that led to this informal high-level meeting between the U.S. and the Soviet Union are twofold. First, there have been changes in the international situation. In recent months, the international situation, especially the situation in Eastern Europe, has undergone certain changes, and the Soviet Union has also encountered some problems. How the two sides deal with these issues is of concern to the other side. In this context, both sides hope to explore the details through the meeting. The United States hopes to learn "firsthand" about the situation and views from the Soviet leadership to avoid "losing something" in this rapidly changing era or mishandling the situation, which could affect bilateral relations. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, does not want the United States to gain some strategic advantage from this or disrupt the pace of U.S.-Soviet relations, which could affect the reform process. Therefore, this meeting seems to be an important link in adjusting U.S.-Soviet relations in a specific environment.

Secondly, the recent adjustment of U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union by the Bush administration has also led to the holding of the U.S.-Soviet summit. Since Bush took office as U.S. President, the U.S. government has spent a long time reviewing foreign policy, especially policy towards the Soviet Union and military strategy. It has proposed the long-term goal of "going beyond containment" and establishing a relatively stable relationship with the Soviet Union. However, due to differing views within the government on Soviet reform (this discrepancy still exists), the United States has been relatively inactive in proposing initiatives in U.S.-Soviet relations and East-West relations for a period of time. The cautious stance of the Bush administration in policy has drawn criticism and criticism at home and abroad. It is in this context that the U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union has undergone some changes in recent months, mainly taking a more active attitude towards Soviet reform and arms control issues. Similarly, in dealing with the issue of the U.S.-Soviet summit, the U.S. attitude has also changed. According to reports, in July this year, after visiting Poland and Hungary, Bush did not want to rush into a summit meeting, but now he hopes to hold an informal summit meeting to exchange views with the Soviet leadership. Bush's proposal was responded to by the Soviet side, but it does not completely coincide with the Soviet idea of a formal summit meeting. It was not until Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze visited the United States in September this year and held talks with Bush and Baker that the two sides agreed to hold two summit meetings in succession, thus paving the way for a new round of high-level dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

However, people believe that although the U.S. and the Soviet Union have set a schedule for the summit meeting, it has not solved the many practical problems that exist, and more importantly, what kind of results this meeting will produce.

    当前美苏关系中的重要一环
    本报记者　张启昕
    继今年九月下旬美苏宣布布什总统和戈尔巴乔夫主席于明年春末夏初在美国举行正式首脑会晤之后，十月三十一日又宣布两国领导人还将于十二月二日至三日举行一次“非正式”的首脑会晤。在相隔半年左右的时间里，美苏连续举行两次最高级会晤，无疑是当前美苏关系中的重大事件。如果说，明年的首脑会晤多少是意料之中的，那么这次非正式会晤为何举行，就成了人们注目的中心。
    根据美国官方的解释，两次首脑会晤的不同点在于，明年的正式会晤将集中于军控、地区冲突等美苏关系的五大议程，双方希望经过几个月的准备，能在某些方面达成协议；而十二月的非正式会晤则无既定的议题，是就当前国际形势和美苏关系的发展广泛交换意见，以便两国领导人更加了解彼此的观点。
    从此间各方面人士的分析看，美苏举行这次非正式最高级会晤，主要是由两种因素促成的。首先是国际形势的变化。近几个月来，国际形势特别是东欧局势发生了某些变化，苏联国内也遇到了一些问题。美苏双方如何对待这些问题，都为另一方所关注。在这种情况下双方都希望通过会晤探寻底细，美国希望从苏联领导人那里了解“第一手”的情况和看法，以免“在急剧变化的年代失去什么”，或者处置失当，影响两国关系；苏联则不希望美国从中谋取某种战略好处，或者打乱美苏关系的步调，影响改革进程。因此，这种会晤似乎是在特定环境下美苏调节关系的一个重要环节。
    其次是布什政府近期调整对苏政策，也促成了美苏首脑会晤的举行。布什就任美国总统以来，美国政府曾经对外交政策特别是对苏政策和军事战略问题进行过长时间的审议，提出了
  “超越遏制”、与苏建立较为稳定的关系的长期目标。但由于政府内部对苏联改革的看法不一致（这种不一致目前依然存在），在一个时期内美国在美苏关系和东西方关系方面很少主动提出倡议。布什政府在政策上过于谨慎的状况在国内外引起了非议和批评。正是在这种情况下，美国的对苏政策近几个月经历了某种演变，主要是在对待苏联改革和军备控制问题上采取了比以往较为积极的态度。同样，在对待美苏首脑会晤问题上，美国的态度也有变化。据报道，今年七月，布什在访问波兰、匈牙利之后，本不想急于举行首脑会晤，但现在却希望举行一次非正式的首脑会晤，以便与苏联领导人交换意见。布什的这一建议得到了苏联方面的响应，但同苏联所主张的正式首脑会晤的想法并不完全一致，直到苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽今年九月访美，同布什、贝克会谈后，双方才商定前后举行两次首脑会晤，从而为美苏新一轮的最高级对话铺平了道路。
    然而，人们认为，虽然美苏为首脑会晤确定了日程，但其本身并未解决现实存在的诸多问题，更为重要的是这种会晤将会产生什么结果。
