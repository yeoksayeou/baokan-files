Xinhua News Agency, Xining, November 4th. People's Daily reporters Wang Jingye and Zha Zhenpu report: The nationwide loss-making leader in the casting industry—Qinghai Shanchuan Casting Plant—has, over the past three years, developed one new by-product annually. By leveraging these by-products, the plant has ensured the completion of national mandatory plans. Last year, they successfully turned a loss into a profit. In the first nine months of this year, their sales revenue reached 110 million yuan, a 55% increase over the previous year, elevating them to the ranks of the top ten casting enterprises in the nation.

This casting plant possesses 900 sets of equipment, 70 million yuan in fixed assets, and 3,000 employees. Over its 20-plus years of operation, except for two years of marginal profit, it has accumulated losses totaling 30 million yuan. To reverse this long-standing trend of losses, in 1984, the plant dispatched technical personnel to survey domestic and international markets. Starting in 1986, they successively built four silicon iron furnaces. Last year, they exported 15,000 tons of silicon iron, which was well-received in Japan. The profitability of Shanchuan Plant sparked a "silicon iron boom" in Qinghai.

The success of silicon iron production provided economic support for the planned production of castings. The plant invested 5 million yuan from the profits of by-products to renovate the casting technology and processes. They completed the microcomputer upgrade of the blast furnace, the vibration aging process, and the horizontal continuous casting production line for cast iron profiles, among other projects. These efforts have begun to change the image of casting enterprises as being "dumb, big, and black."

    抓副产品　养主产品
    山川机床铸造厂确保指令性计划
    本报西宁11月4日电　新华社记者王精业、本报记者郅振璞报道：全国铸造业亏损大户——青海山川铸造厂，近三年每年研究开发一项副产品，以副养铸，确保完成国家指令性计划。去年，他们一举扭亏盈利。今年前9个月，销售收入1.1亿元，比去年增长55％，跨入全国十大铸造企业行列。
    这家铸造厂拥有900台套设备、7000万元固定资产、3000名职工，建厂20余年，除两年微利外，累计亏损3000万元。为改变长期亏损局面，1984年，该厂抽出技术人员考察国内外市场，1986年后陆续筹建4台硅铁炉子，去年出口1.5万吨硅铁畅销日本。山川厂的盈利，使青海兴起“硅铁热”。
    硅铁等生产的成功，为计划产品铸件的生产提供了经济后盾。该厂用副产品收益，投资500万元改造铸铁业技术工艺，先后完成了冲天炉微机改造，振动时效、水平连续铸造铸铁型材生产线等，初步改变了铸造企业“傻大黑粗”的形象。
