Guinea's economic development has seen significant results from some measures taken in recent years.

From 1986 to 1988, Guinea's GDP grew at an average annual rate of 5%, showing a trend of economic development. The inflation rate also dropped from 72% in 1986 to 33.7% in 1987 and 26% in 1988. Over the past few years, Guinea's agriculture has developed, the export of mineral products has increased significantly, the market has been active, and the city of Conakry has been renovated, undergoing significant changes.

Since 1986, the Guinean government has implemented a series of major reforms, including:

(1) Reforming agricultural policies. The new government decided in 1984 to abolish the previous system of agricultural "collectivization" and "mechanization," instead supporting individual farmers and private plantation owners to develop agriculture. In 1986, the government also raised the prices for purchasing agricultural products. For grain purchases, a free pricing policy was implemented, with no government intervention. The prices for economic crops were determined by the government.

(2) Rebuilding the financial and monetary system. Specific measures included:

   (a) Reorganizing the central bank to restore its functions in executing national financial policies, issuing currency, auctioning foreign exchange, and managing foreign exchange and gold reserves.

   (b) Closing six state-owned commercial banks, auditing accounts, and gradually settling frozen deposits. At the same time, three new banks were established in cooperation with foreign countries.

   (c) Implementing currency devaluation and replacing the currency. On January 4, 1986, the Guinean government announced a 92.5% devaluation of the syli, and on January 6, began replacing the syli with the Guinean franc.

   (d) The central bank implemented a weekly foreign exchange auction system, making the Guinean franc a partially convertible currency.

(3) Restructuring state-owned factories and enterprises. Some were shut down for restructuring to determine new directions; those that could still make a profit continued operations.

(4) Streamlining organizations and reducing redundant staff. A census found that Guinea had 87,300 officials and public sector employees (excluding military personnel). The government set a target to reduce this number by 30,000, about one-third of the total, and also implemented measures to streamline organizations.

In addition to the above reforms, the Guinean government also implemented new commercial policies, adjusted prices, provided subsidies and raised wages for public sector employees, and formulated economic laws and regulations.

The reasons for the success of Guinea's economic measures include:

First, the new leadership learned from the past radical policies that led to economic stagnation and backwardness, and was determined to change this, with effective measures that gained the support of the people.

Second, Guinea is rich in resources and has developed them to a certain extent, ensuring a certain amount of foreign exchange income each year, a condition that other surrounding countries do not have.

Finally, in 1986, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank provided Guinea with the first tranche of loans, amounting to 33 million SDRs and 42.7 million SDRs, respectively. France provided Guinea with approximately $100 million in aid loans each year from 1985 to 1987. These favorable conditions helped Guinea's economy achieve initial success and ensured its continued development.

On the other hand, Guinea's economic development still faces some problems. First, the sudden change in the economic system made it difficult for many people to adapt. Additionally, with the implementation of the new economic policies, the trend of a few people using their positions to amass wealth has become more prevalent, and social contradictions have become more pronounced in recent years. Second, the country's economic foundation is weak, management levels are low, and there is a lack of qualified personnel. Third, as the burden of foreign debt increases, conflicts with Western countries will also affect the progress of Guinea's economic development.

However, regardless of the challenges, Guinea's economic development has shown initial results, and its economy is on the rise. As long as political stability is maintained and economic development continues steadily, by the end of the century, Guinea's economy will definitely make greater progress than in the past.

    几内亚经济发展见成效
    杨荣甲
    几内亚的经济发展中近年来采取的一些措施取得了明显成效。
    1986—1988年，几国内生产总值年平均增长率为5％，经济呈发展势头。通货膨胀率也由1986年的72％下降到1987年的33.7％，1988年的26％。几年来，几的农业有所发展，矿产品出口增幅较大，市场活跃，科纳克里市得到整修，面目发生了较大的变化。
    几政府从1986年始，大刀阔斧地推行的一套措施，主要有：（一）改革农业政策。从1984年新政府一执政即做出决定，取消过去实行农业“集体化”、“机械化”的一套做法，改以大力扶持个体农民和私人种植园主发展农业的政策。1986年又提高了农产品收购价格。其中，粮食收购实行自由议价政策，国家不进行干预。经济作物的收购价则由政府确定。（二）重建金融货币体系。这方面的具体做法有：（1）整顿中央银行，恢复该行执行国家金融政策、发行货币、拍卖外汇及管理外汇、黄金储备等职能。（2）关闭六家国营商业银行，核查账目，逐步清偿被冻结的存款。与此同时，又新成立了几与外国合资的三家银行。（3）实行货币贬值并更换货币。1986年1月4日，几政府宣布几货币西里贬值92.5％，紧接着1月6日又开始了更换货币的工作，以几法郎代替西里。（4）中央银行实行每周外汇拍卖制度，使几法郎变为某种可兑换的货币。（三）对国营工厂、企业实行整顿。有的停产整顿待重新确定方向；尚能勉强盈利的工厂继续开工。（四）精简机构，裁减冗员。经普查，几内亚的官员及公职部门的职工总数为87300人（不包括军人）。几政府确定了共裁减3万人的目标，相当总人数的1／3，此外还采取了精简机构等措施。
    除上述改革措施之外，几政府还推行了新的商业政策、调整物价、对公职人员实行补贴并提高工资及制定经济法律和法规等措施。
    几内亚的经济措施之所以见成效的有利条件是：首先是新领导人吸取了过去激进政策使经济停滞落后的教训，因而决心加以改变，措施得力，并得到人民的拥护；其次是几内亚资源丰富，并得到一定程度的开发，每年一定数量的外汇收入有保证，此种有利条件为周围一些国家所不及；最后1986年国际货币基金组织和世界银行向几提供的第一期贷款分别为3300万特别提款权和4270万特别提款权。法国于1985—1987年每年向几提供约一亿美元的援助贷款。这些有利条件促使几内亚经济初期取得成功并保证其今后继续发展得以进行。另一方面，几内亚经济发展中目前也还存在一定的问题。一是经济体制的骤然转变使不少人一下子难以适应。另外，随着新经济政策的实施，少数人利用职权聚敛财富的风气越来越盛，社会矛盾几年来明显发展。二是国家的经济基础薄弱，管理水平不高，合格的人才缺乏。三是随着外债负担的加重，几与西方国家矛盾的增长也将会影响几经济发展的进程。
    但无论如何，几内亚的经济发展已初见成效，几的经济是向上的。只要能保持住政局的稳定并使经济稳步地发展下去，到本世纪末，几经济将肯定会比过去有更大的进展。
