Qingdao has successfully developed a new type of electronic piano. Known as the "Island of Pianos," Qingdao now truly lives up to its name. A series of new force-sensitive electronic pianos, praised by music authorities such as Zhao Tuo, Li Ling, and Li Delun as being of the "highest level in the country," has been developed after more than a year of technological breakthroughs. This marks the beginning of a new era in China's electronic piano production.

The "Qingdao—Libeixin" series of new force-sensitive electronic pianos, developed by the Qingdao Electronic Musical Instrument Industry Company by digesting and absorbing advanced foreign technologies, and designed and manufactured independently, combines the functions of traditional pianos, pipe organs, and harmoniums. The sound is rich and authentic, with a deep and full reverb and stereo effect.
