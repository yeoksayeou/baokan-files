Xinhua News Agency, Wellington, November 24th.

New Zealand today began implementing a new visa application policy to prevent foreign students studying English from working illegally.

Under this new policy, visa applicants must complete all application procedures, secure acceptance, and pay tuition fees before they can obtain a visa to study English in New Zealand for less than one year.

Alternatively, applicants must complete all application procedures and provide a guarantee of employment upon return to their home country.

New Zealand's Minister of Immigration, Douglas, stated in a press release today that a significant number of foreign students are working illegally in New Zealand without attending language classes.

He said, "Clearly, New Zealand's visa system is being exploited by a large number of students who come to the country primarily to find work and obtain residency."

The New Zealand government had previously announced that from the end of May this year, foreign students coming to New Zealand for short-term studies of three months or less would be exempt from visa requirements, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of students coming to study.

　　新西兰实行新签证政策
　　以防外国学生非法工作
    新华社惠灵顿11月24日电　新西兰今天开始实行新的申请签证政策，以防止在新西兰学习英语的外国学生非法工作。
    根据这项新政策，签证申请者只有在办妥了申请手续，获得对方接受，并交纳了学习费用之后，他们才能获得在新西兰学习英语不到一学年的签证。
    或者申请人办妥各项申请，并且附有回国后继续允许就业的保证书。
    新西兰移民部长道格拉斯今天在一份新闻公报里说，相当数量的外国学生在新西兰非法地工作而不在学校学习语言。
    他说：“显然，新西兰的签证制度正在被大量学生利用。他们到这个国家来的主要目的是找工作做和获得居住权。”
    新西兰政府曾宣布从今年5月底起，对来新西兰进行3个月以内短期学习的外国留学生免签证，从而使到新留学人数剧增。
