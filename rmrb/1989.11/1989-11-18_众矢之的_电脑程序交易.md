    Target of Criticism
    – Computer Program Trading
    By Zhang Liang, Correspondent

    After the Dow Jones Index plummeted 190 points on October 13, computer program trading once again became a hot topic of discussion among American financial circles and general stock investors. Supporters and critics each have their own arguments, and the debate is intense. The focus of the debate is whether computer program trading should be restricted or abolished.

    Simply put, computer program trading refers to stock traders inputting their buying and selling business into a computer, which then manages the process according to programmed instructions, automatically issuing buy or sell orders. The controversy lies in the fact that stock traders use computers to discover price differences between the spot market and the futures market, simultaneously conducting multiple stock transactions to make a profit. Those using computer program trading are large stock traders, and thus have a significant impact on market trends. When the stock market experiences dramatic fluctuations, once the computer issues a sell signal, it immediately triggers a chain reaction that is unstoppable.

    In the eyes of some, computer program trading is the culprit behind the 1987 "Black Monday" and the recent stock market crash. They believe that as long as computer program trading exists, the stock market will never be stable. Therefore, these people advocate for strict restrictions or even an outright ban on computer program trading. However, others defend it, saying that computer program trading itself is "healthy." As an advanced trading method in the market, it should not be restricted, let alone arbitrarily banned.

    In the recent volatile New York stock market, coupled with the fact that computer program trading played a role in the two previous stock market crashes, those who criticize computer program trading seem to have the upper hand. In recent days, some large stock traders have publicly announced the suspension of computer program trading to alleviate their clients' concerns about market volatility. On Capitol Hill, some members of Congress have proposed strengthening the management and restriction of computer program trading. The New York Stock Exchange Board is also considering taking certain preventive measures. However, the chairman of the exchange admits that banning computer program trading is like telling Americans not to drive cars but to ride horses, which is simply not feasible.

    The reason why computer program trading has become a target of criticism seems to go even deeper. Some experts have recently warned that if computer program trading continues to drive the New York stock market into dramatic fluctuations, it will inevitably damage its reputation and its position in the international financial market.

    However, restricting or abolishing computer program trading cannot guarantee that the New York stock market will not face another crisis, because stock market trends are ultimately influenced by economic factors. Moreover, stock trading, to some extent, is a speculative activity similar to gambling. With any slight disturbance, the New York stock market will fluctuate, and sometimes it will even lead to a major disaster like the 1987 "Black Monday."

### 众矢之的——电脑程序交易

    众矢之的
    ——电脑程序交易
    本报记者　张亮
    10月13日道·琼斯指数暴跌190点之后，电脑程序交易再度成为美国金融界乃至一般股票投资者纷纷议论的热门话题。支持者和批评者各执一词，争论激烈。其焦点是，是否应该限制或取消电脑程序交易。
    简单说来，电脑程序交易就是指股票交易商把买卖股票业务输入电脑，由电脑按编制的程序进行管理，自动发出买进或卖出的指令。人们争论的是，股票商利用电脑发现现货市场和提货市场之间的价格差异同时进行多种股票交易以获利。使用电脑程序交易的都是大股票商，因而对股市行情的影响巨大。当股市行情剧烈波动时，一旦电脑发出抛售信号，就会即刻引起连锁反应，势不可当。
    在一些人看来，电脑程序交易是导致1987年“黑色星期一”和最近一次股票暴跌的罪魁祸首。他们认为，只要电脑程序交易存在，股票市场就永无宁日。因此，这些人主张严格限制甚至干脆禁止电脑程序交易。但是，也有人辩护说，电脑程序交易本身是“健康”的。作为市场上的一种先进交易手段，对它既不应该限制，更不能随意禁止。
    在近期纽约股市动荡不稳的情况下，再加上电脑程序交易在前两次股票暴跌中至少起了推波助澜的作用，对电脑程序交易持批评态度的人似乎占了上风。连日来，一些大股票交易商已公开宣布停止进行电脑程序交易，以消除其客户对股市动荡的忧虑。在国会山，有的议员已提议加强对电脑程序交易的管理和限制。纽约股票交易所董事会也在考虑采取某些防范措施。但该交易所董事长承认，禁止电脑程序交易等于不让美国人坐车而让他们骑马，是根本办不到的事情。
    电脑程序交易之所以成为众矢之的，看来还有更深一层原因。有的专家最近就警告说，如果电脑程序交易继续驱使纽约股市剧烈动荡，势必损害它的信誉及其在国际金融市场上的地位。
    但是，限制或取消电脑程序交易并不能保证纽约股市不再发生危机，因为股市行情毕竟还是受经济因素所左右，更何况股票交易在某种程度上说是一种类似赌博的投机性活动。一有风吹草动，纽约股市就会起伏波动，有时还会酿成诸如1987年“黑色星期一”的大祸。
