How can democratic parties contribute to governance, rectification, and deepening reforms? Fei Xiaotong, chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL), proposed six characters: "Do good deeds, do practical work."

Fei Xiaotong's remarks were made at the beginning of the fifth enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the CDL, which started this morning. The main content of the meeting is to study and implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and to research issues related to strengthening the ideological and organizational construction of the CDL.

Fei Xiaotong said that doing good deeds and practical work currently means closely relying on the leadership of the CPC, addressing the urgent needs of the party and the government, fully mobilizing and rationally organizing the intellectual resources of the CDL, adapting to local conditions, and working on the ground to carry out work, providing suggestions and advice for governance, rectification, and deepening reforms. Fei Xiaotong said that participating in politics is not just empty talk, but through our actual work, we can express our political views, opinions, and suggestions. By doing good deeds and practical work, we can understand many situations, discover existing problems, know the difficulties faced by the party and the government, and thus truly propose practical and feasible opinions and suggestions that are beneficial to the party and the government's decision-making. Fei Xiaotong proposed that the CDL should find a better and more conscious way to develop itself under the leadership of the CPC. He proposed to form a social service system based on intellectual resources to implement the proposition of doing good deeds and practical work under the leadership of the CPC.

It is reported that in recent years, the Central Committee of the CDL and the CDL organizations in provinces and municipalities have successively carried out a series of major research and consulting activities, including the development planning of Shanghai Pudong New Area, the economic and social development planning of Minnan Triangle, the economic development planning of Chuanzhong Shangling Area, the economic development strategy of Hainan Province, the comprehensive treatment and development of the Jianjiang section of the Yangtze River and the Dongting Lake area, the comprehensive development of the Yellow River Delta, the feasibility study and demonstration of the multi-ethnic economic development zone in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and the economic and social development model of Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province. Among them, the suggestion on establishing a multi-ethnic economic development zone in the upper reaches of the Yellow River was affirmed by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. Relevant parties believe that these activities are specific manifestations of the CDL doing practical work and good deeds for society, and are a deep, high-level, and effective way of participating in politics and providing consultations.

Fei Xiaotong said that to better play the role of the CDL in governance, rectification, and deepening reforms, the CDL must seriously strengthen its ideological and organizational construction. He said that in the past, we had more general calls and fewer specific measures; more documents and arrangements, but less implementation and inspection. After this political turmoil, we feel more strongly that we must not delay strengthening our own construction and must do it seriously.

Fei Xiaotong finally said that the CDL is a component of the multi-party cooperation system under the leadership of the CPC, accepting the leadership of the CPC, which is not only a glorious tradition of the CDL but also a regulation in the CDL charter. He emphasized that in the work of the CDL, only by adhering to the leadership of the CPC can we continuously improve and develop the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation, and promote the development of socialist democracy and legal system in a step-by-step and effective manner. This common belief and action guideline must be implemented in every organization, every member, and every work of the CDL.

Vice chairmen of the Central Committee of the CDL, Gao Tian, Ye Duyi, Tao Dazong, Guan Mengjue, Luo Hanxian, Ma Dayou, Ding Shisun, Kang Zhenhuang, Kong Lingren, the chairman of the Consultative Committee, Su Buqing, and vice chairmen Li Wenyi, Lin Hengyuan, Wen Jiashu, Pan Daqian, attended the meeting.

　　民主党派在治理整顿深化改革中如何发挥作用
　　费孝通提出：做好事，做实事
    新华社北京11月20日电　（记者邹爱国）民主党派在治理整顿、深化改革中如何发挥作用？民盟中央主席费孝通提出六个字：“做好事，做实事”。
    费孝通的这个意见是在今天上午开始召开的民盟第五次中央常务委员会扩大会议上说的。这次会议的主要内容是学习贯彻中共十三届五中全会精神，研究加强民盟思想建设和组织建设问题。
    费孝通说，做好事、做实事，当前就是要紧紧依靠共产党的领导，急党和政府之所急，充分调动和合理组织民盟的智力，因地制宜，脚踏实地去开展工作，为治理整顿、深化改革献计献策。费孝通说，参政议政不是空谈，而是通过我们的实际工作，来发表我们的政治见解、意见和建议。通过做好事，做实事，我们可以了解到许多情况，发现存在的问题，知道党和政府的困难，也就能真正提出有利于党和政府决策的切实可行的意见和建议。费孝通提出，民盟要更好地、更自觉地为在共产党领导下合作共事的民主党派找到一条发展自己的道路。他提出，要形成一个以智力为基础的社会服务体系，以贯彻在共产党领导下做好事、做实事的主张。
    据介绍，近几年来，民盟中央和民盟省市组织先后开展了上海浦东开发区、闽南三角地区经济社会发展规划、川中上陵地区经济发展规划、海南省经济发展战略、长江荆江段和洞庭湖区的综合治理与开发、黄河三角洲的综合开发、黄河上游多民族经济开发区的可行性调查与论证，江苏徐州市经济社会发展模型等一系列重大的研究咨询活动。其中关于在黄河上游建立多民族经济开发区的建议，受到中共中央、国务院的肯定。有关方面认为，这些活动都是民盟为社会做实事、做好事的具体表现，是一种深入的、高层次的、有实效的参政议政方式。
    费孝通说，为了更好地发挥民盟在治理整顿，深化改革中的作用，民盟要认真加强思想建设和组织建设。他说，过去我们对这个问题是一般号召多，具体措施少；发文布置多，落实检查少。经过这场政治风波，我们更加感到加强自身建设已经不能再贻误时机，必须切切实实地做好。
    费孝通最后说，民盟是共产党领导的多党合作制中的一个组成部分，接受共产党的领导，不仅是民盟的光荣传统，也是民盟章程中规定的。他强调，在民盟工作中，只有始终坚持共产党的领导，才能使多党合作与政治协商制度不断完善、不断发展，才能有步骤、有实效地推动社会主义民主与法制建设。这一共同的信念和行动准则，一定要贯彻到每一个民盟组织、每一个盟员、每一项工作中去。
    民盟中央副主席高天、叶笃义、陶大镛、关梦觉、罗涵先、马大猷、丁石孙、康振黄、孔令仁，参议委员会主任苏步青，副主任李文宜、林亨元、闻家驷、潘大逵，出席了会议。
