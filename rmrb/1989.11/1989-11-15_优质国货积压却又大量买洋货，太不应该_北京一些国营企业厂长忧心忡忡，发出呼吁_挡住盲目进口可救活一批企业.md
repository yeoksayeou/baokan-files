	"Blocking irrational imports can save a batch of enterprises!" This is the appeal from the managers of some large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in Beijing.

	According to the manager of Beijing Optical Instrument Factory, Jin Hongshan, the 9 types of optical measuring instruments produced by their factory using imported foreign technology have all reached the international standards of the 1980s and can replace imports. For example, the factory's annual production capacity for infrared ranging instruments is 500 units, but the actual orders are only about 150 units. Although each domestic unit is 10,000 to 20,000 yuan cheaper than imported ones, the country still spends tens of millions of dollars each year to import about 800 units.

	The manager of Beijing Broadcasting Equipment Factory, Wang Dianfu, told reporters that despite the fact that the television transmitters produced by their factory using advanced foreign technology can fully equip the central and provincial television stations, and are cheaper and easier to maintain than imported products, some provincial television stations still spend a large amount of foreign exchange to import from abroad.

	The photoelectric direct-reading spectrometer produced by Beijing Second Optical Instrument Factory has key components that are imported, and its technical level is not inferior to foreign counterparts. Each unit costs only half the price of imported products. The factory's annual production task is only 8 units, but some departments still require the import of more than ten units.

	Why are domestically producible products still imported in large quantities? According to the managers, in addition to weak macro-control, another reason is that purchasing foreign products can provide opportunities for overseas trips, negotiations, and training. Some units, in order to obtain the pass for importing equipment, deliberately exaggerate the technical performance of the equipment needed by their unit, and then use the excuse that domestic products do not meet the requirements to "cross the ocean."

	Many managers pointed out that one of the important reasons for the current sluggish sales, product backlog, and declining economic benefits is the flooding of the domestic market with foreign goods. Irrational imports have severely impacted the domestic market, pushing many enterprises into a predicament. They hope that the state will take practical measures, and products that can be produced domestically should not be allowed to be imported.

    优质国货积压却又大量买洋货，太不应该
    北京一些国营企业厂长忧心忡忡，发出呼吁
    挡住盲目进口可救活一批企业
    据新华社北京11月14日电　（记者夏俊生、刘浦泉）“挡住盲目进口，可以救活一批企业！”这是北京一些国营大中型企业的厂长发出的呼吁。
    据北京光学仪器厂厂长金洪山介绍，他们厂引进国外技术生产的9种光学测量仪器，都达到了国际80年代水平，可以替代进口。如红外测距仪工厂年生产能力500台，但实际订货只有150多台。尽管国产每台价格比进口便宜一、二万元人民币，但全国一年仍得花上千万美元进口800台左右。
    北京广播器材厂厂长王殿甫向记者反映，尽管他们厂引进国外先进技术生产的电视发射机完全能够装备中央和各省市的电视台，而且比进口产品价格便宜，维修方便，但一些省市的电视台仍花巨额外汇从国外进口。
    北京第二光学仪器厂生产的光电直读光谱仪，关键元器件是进口的，技术水平并不比国外同类产品逊色，每台价格只相当于进口产品的1／2。工厂一年的生产任务只有8台，可是有的部门却要求进口十几台。
    为什么国内能生产的产品还大量进口？据厂长们分析，除了宏观控制不力以外，购买外国产品可以出国考察、谈判和培训也是一个原因。一些单位为了搞到进口设备的通行证，故意拔高本单位所需设备的技术性能，然后以国内产品性能达不到要求为由而“漂洋过海”。
    不少厂长指出，当前销售疲软、产品积压、经济效益下降的一个重要原因是国内市场上洋货泛滥。盲目进口严重冲击了国内市场，使一大批企业生产经营陷于困境。他们希望国家采取切实措施，国内能生产的，一律不准进口。
