The Arab states at the United Nations today demanded that the Security Council hold an emergency meeting to discuss the grave situation caused by Israel's suppression of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories.

This demand was made after the Arab states held an emergency meeting yesterday.

According to sources close to the Security Council, the council's president for this month, Li Luke, is currently in bilateral consultations with Security Council members to discuss the matter.

In recent days, diplomats from Arab states and the Palestinian observer mission to the United Nations have repeatedly reported to the Security Council on Israel's suppression of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. Israel's crackdown has resulted in many deaths.

    阿拉伯国家要求安理会紧急讨论以占区形势
    新华社联合国11月3日电  联合国阿拉伯国家集团今天要求安理会召开紧急会议，讨论以色列在占领区镇压巴勒斯坦人民所造成的严重局势。
    这一要求是在阿拉伯国家集团于昨天举行紧急会议后提出的。
    据接近安理会的人士透露，安理会本月份主席李鹿野正在与安理会成员国进行双边接触，商讨此事。
    最近几天，阿拉伯国家和巴勒斯坦驻联合国观察团的外交官不断向安理会陈述以色列在占领区镇压巴勒斯坦人民的情况。以色列的镇压已造成许多人死亡。
