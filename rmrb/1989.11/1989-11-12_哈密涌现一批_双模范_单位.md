Once renowned nationwide for the "Hami Spirit," the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's Hami City has added new colors to the tapestry of ethnic unity and military-civilian unity. Currently, 78.5% of the district-level units and 90% of the village-level units in the city have become "double exemplary" units in ethnic unity and military-civilian unity.

Efforts have been made to vigorously develop education for ethnic minorities and support ethnic minority groups in poverty alleviation and prosperity. In recent years, the city has built and renovated 41 brick-and-wood school buildings, with over 77% being ethnic minority schools. The city's education department has directed the training and cultivation of over 300 teaching backbone members for pastoral areas.

Tianshan District, where Uygur and Kazakh ethnic groups reside, is the poorest region in Hami City, with some impoverished households still facing subsistence issues. Hami City has placed its poverty alleviation focus on this district, implementing a series of measures that have improved the living conditions of over ten thousand agricultural and pastoral residents.

The city places importance on cultivating and utilizing ethnic minority cadres. Among the 23 county-level cadres in the city's leadership team, ethnic minorities account for 53%; among the 139 members of the Political Consultative Conference, ethnic minorities account for 58%.

The political and professional qualities of ethnic minority cadres have been continuously improving. Over 60% of the in-service cadres in the city can understand two or more ethnic languages, effectively enhancing work efficiency. Currently, Han people learning the Uygur language and ethnic minorities learning Mandarin have become a trend in this city.

In the past five years, Hami City and the stationed military have settled 350 family members and over 100 retired officers from the units stationed in Hami. The military has also striven to contribute more to the people of Hami. Since 1986, the various units stationed in Hami have participated in over 20 major rescue and relief operations, mobilizing thousands of officers and soldiers, protecting the lives and property of the various ethnic groups in Hami City, and receiving unanimous praise from the people of Hami.

    哈密涌现一批“双模范”单位
    曾一度以“哈密精神”闻名全国的新疆维吾尔自治区哈密市，在民族团结、军民团结的画卷上又添新色彩。目前，全市已有78.5％的区级单位和90％的村级单位成为民族团结、军民团结“双模范”单位。
    大力发展少数民族教育，扶持少数民族群众脱贫致富。近几年来，全市新建和改建41所砖木结构的校舍，民族学校占77％以上；市教育部门定向为牧区培训、培养了300多名教学骨干。
    维吾尔族和哈萨克族聚居的天山区是哈密市最贫穷的地区，有些贫困户的温饱问题尚未解决。哈密市把扶贫重点放在这个区，采取了一系列措施，改变了居住在这里的万余名农牧民的生活状况。
    重视培养和使用少数民族干部。市领导班子的23名县级干部中，少数民族占53％；139名政协委员中，少数民族占58％。
    少数民族干部的政治素质和业务素质不断提高，全市60％以上的在职干部能听懂两种以上民族语言，有效地提高了工作效率。目前，汉族学习维吾尔族语言，少数民族学习汉语已在这个市蔚然成风。
    近5年来，哈密市和驻地军队安置家属350人，安置驻哈密部队转业干部100多名。部队也努力为哈密人民多做贡献，1986年以来，驻哈密各部队仅参加大的抢险救灾就达20多次，出动干部战士上万人次，保护了哈密市各族人民的生命和财产安全，受到哈密市各族人民的一致好评。
