Liu Fuzhi, the Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said at the opening of the National Procurators-General Conference today that the facts of anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts have proven that the vast majority of our party and government officials are honest and serve the people wholeheartedly. A small number are involved in embezzlement and bribery. All levels of procuratorial organs must continue to severely punish embezzlement, bribery, and criminal activities.

Liu Fuzhi said that we should correctly analyze the situation where embezzlement and bribery cases have surged. We should not simply view this phenomenon as corruption and bribery crimes increasing with each crackdown, as this does not align with objective facts. Nor should we have the illusion that corruption is becoming more severe. He said that we should see that over the past year, a large number of embezzlement and bribery cases have been investigated and dealt with. This is mainly the result of the Party Central Committee and various levels of party committees strengthening leadership, mobilizing the masses, and the procuratorial organs' work going deep.

Liu Fuzhi revealed that various levels of procuratorial organs have made significant efforts to investigate and deal with embezzlement and bribery cases. According to incomplete statistics, from January to October this year, procuratorial organs across the country received nearly 100,000 embezzlement and bribery cases (including self-surrenders), an increase of 1.8 times compared to the same period last year; have initiated investigations into nearly 50,000 cases (also including self-surrenders), an increase of more than 2 times compared to the same period last year; have prosecuted more than 15,000 people in people's courts, an increase of more than 1 time compared to the same period last year; and have recovered illicit funds and goods worth more than 300 million yuan, an increase of 1 time compared to the same period last year.

Liu Fuzhi introduced that since this year, there have been breakthroughs in the investigation and handling of major embezzlement and bribery cases. From January to October, procuratorial organs across the country have initiated investigations into more than 8,000 cases of embezzlement and bribery involving amounts over 10,000 yuan (including self-surrenders), an increase of more than 3 times compared to the same period last year; have dealt with more than 1,000 cases of embezzlement and bribery involving county-level and above officials, an increase of 1 time compared to the same period last year. In the construction, banking, railway, supply and marketing, materials, and grain sectors and departments, significant results have been achieved in dealing with cases of embezzlement and bribery utilizing industry privileges.

Liu Fuzhi analyzed that we should fully affirm the tremendous achievements of the anti-corruption and anti-bribery struggle, redouble our efforts, and press forward. At the same time, we must also clearly recognize that many deeply hidden criminals have not been exposed, and some major cases, especially important ones, have not been touched. Moreover, there are still many who dare to commit crimes in defiance of the law, and they have not completely curbed their actions due to severe crackdowns. It must be made clear that the anti-corruption and anti-bribery struggle is a major battle, and the struggle is long-term, complex, and arduous.

Liu Fuzhi proposed in his report that the basic tasks of the procuratorial organs in 1990 are: to seriously study and implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, to fully play the role of legal supervision, to continue to firmly carry out the anti-corruption and anti-bribery struggle, to continue to severely and swiftly crack down on serious criminal activities according to law, and to ensure the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy.

Liu Fuzhi requires the procuratorial organs to continue to make the anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts the top priority in combating economic crimes, to achieve new progress in dealing with major and important cases; to further mobilize the masses and carry out reporting work, striving to expose deeply hidden criminals; to seriously investigate and punish cases of retaliation against informants, and to encourage the masses to actively report and expose embezzlement, bribery, and other crimes.

    刘复之在全国检察长工作会议上强调
    党政机关工作人员绝大多数廉洁
　　检察机关要继续严惩贪污受贿者
    本报北京11月21日电　记者张志业、毛磊报道：最高人民检察院检察长刘复之在今天开幕的全国检察长工作会议上说，反贪污反贿赂的事实证明，我们党政机关工作人员绝大多数是廉洁的，是全心全意为人民服务的，贪污、受贿犯罪分子是极少数。各级检察机关要继续严惩贪污受贿和刑事犯罪活动。
    刘复之说，我们应该正确分析贪污、贿赂案件大幅度上升的情况，不应该把这种现象简单地看成贪污、贿赂犯罪越打越多，因为这不符合客观事实；也不能发生错觉，认为腐败现象越来越严重。他说，应当看到，一年来查处了大批贪污、贿赂犯罪案件，这主要是党中央和各级党委加强领导，发动群众，检察机关工作深入的结果。
    刘复之透露，各级检察院努力查处贪污、贿赂案件，取得明显成效。据不完全统计，今年1至10月，全国检察院共受理贪污贿赂案件近10万件（包括自首数），比去年同期增加1.8倍；已立案侦查近5万件（也包括自首数），比去年同期增加2倍多；已向人民法院提起公诉1.5万多人，比去年同期增加1倍多；缴回赃款赃物折合人民币3亿多元，比去年同期增加1倍。
    刘复之介绍说，今年以来，查处贪污、贿赂大案要案有突破性进展。1至10月，全国检察院已立案万元以上贪污、贿赂大案8000件（包括自首数），比去年同期增加3倍多；已查处的县以上干部贪污、贿赂要案1000多件，比去年同期增加1倍。在建筑、银行、铁路、供销、物资、粮食等系统和部门，查处利用行业特权进行贪污、贿赂的案件收到了显著效果。
    刘复之分析说，我们应当充分肯定反贪污、贿赂斗争的巨大成绩，加倍努力，乘胜前进。同时也要清醒地认识到，很多隐蔽较深的犯罪分子还没有揭露出来，有的大案特别是要案还没被触动，而且“顶风作案”、以身试法的还不少，他们并未因为严厉打击而完全收敛。必须明确，反贪污、贿赂斗争是一场大的战斗，斗争是长期的、复杂的、艰巨的。
    刘复之在报告中提出1990年检察机关的基本任务是：认真学习贯彻党的十三届五中全会精神，充分发挥法律监督职能，继续坚持开展反贪污、贿赂斗争，继续依法从重从快打击严重刑事犯罪活动，为保障国民经济持续、稳定、协调发展。
    刘复之要求检察机关继续把反贪污、贿赂作为打击经济犯罪的第一位工作，使查处大案要案的工作取得新的进展；要进一步发动群众，开展举报工作，力求挖出隐蔽较深的犯罪分子；要严肃查处打击报复举报人的案件，鼓励群众检举揭发贪污、贿赂等犯罪的积极性。
