Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 19th.

The State Planning Commission recently issued the "Regulations on the Concurrent Implementation of Resource Comprehensive Utilization Projects and New and Expanded Construction Projects," requiring that new, expanded, and renovated projects (including small-scale construction projects) and technological transformation projects, as well as all construction and natural development projects that may cause pollution and ecological damage, must strictly implement pollution control and ecological protection measures concurrently with the main construction projects in terms of design, construction, and production. The commission also made several specific regulations to promote the concurrent implementation, push for resource comprehensive utilization, promote rational resource utilization by enterprises, increase social wealth, and effectively protect the environment.

1. Enterprises' new and expanded construction projects must seriously implement the policy of integrating pollution control with resource comprehensive utilization. Projects with the conditions should consider the rational utilization of resources, energy, and raw materials. Under the conditions of mature process technology and equipment manufacturing, comprehensive utilization products that meet quality standards and have market sales, resource comprehensive utilization projects should, in principle, be designed, constructed, and put into production concurrently with the main construction projects.

2. The project proposal submitted by the applicant for new and expanded projects should clearly specify the content of the corresponding resource comprehensive utilization. The feasibility study report and preliminary design provided by the survey and design department should include the scale and process of resource comprehensive utilization. Projects that do not meet the above conditions will not be consulted by the engineering consulting department, and various levels of competent authorities and resource comprehensive utilization departments will not approve the project establishment.

3. The investment required for resource comprehensive utilization projects should be considered in the investment of the main project, or funds can be raised separately, but it must be included in the national or local fixed asset investment plan along with the main project. According to the approval and management authority stipulated by the state, the various levels of planning commissions (economic commissions), departments in charge of resource comprehensive utilization, industry competent departments, and investment companies are responsible for implementing them in the planning and annual plans.

4. For resource comprehensive utilization projects that do not comply with the concurrent construction regulations, relevant departments will not approve the commencement of work. If the construction intentionally omits the relevant comprehensive utilization projects, the relevant departments have the right to order the restoration and then continue the construction.

5. Resource comprehensive utilization projects should be completed and put into use concurrently with the main projects. Otherwise, the competent authorities will not organize the acceptance and production of the main projects. For main projects that are built and benefit in phases, partial production can be carried out first, but the entire project must be put into production concurrently with the resource comprehensive utilization projects.

6. Due to historical reasons, if resource utilization is not reasonable, comprehensive utilization of resources should be considered as an important part of enterprise construction, and matching construction should be completed within a limited period.

7. Resource comprehensive utilization projects built concurrently will enjoy relevant preferential policies. Products produced by projects funded by enterprises will have product taxes reduced or exempted according to regulations; projects that meet the conditions for unit accounting and independent profit and loss calculation after production will be exempted from income tax and adjustment tax for 5 years.

8. The State Planning Commission will, as needed, adjust the "Concurrent Implementation Directory for Resource Comprehensive Utilization Projects" from time to time. New and expanded projects of collective and township enterprises within the scope of the "Concurrent Implementation Directory for Resource Comprehensive Utilization Projects" should also implement the above regulations.

    国家计委作出八条规定
    基建应与防治污染同步
    新华社北京11月19日电　国家计委最近发布《关于资源综合利用项目与新建和扩建工程实行“三同时”的若干规定》，要求新建、扩建、改建项目（包括小型建设项目）和技术改造项目，以及一切可能对环境造成污染和破坏的工程建设和自然开发项目，都必须严格实行防治污染和生态破坏的措施与主体工程同时设计、施工、投产，并对坚持“三同时”，推动资源综合利用，促进企业合理利用资源，增加社会财富，有效地保护环境，作出了几条具体规定。
    一、企业新建和扩建的基本建设项目，必须认真执行治理污染与资源综合利用相结合的方针。凡是有条件的项目，都应考虑合理利用资源、能源和原材料。在工艺技术和设备制造成熟，综合利用产品符合质量标准又有市场销路的条件下，资源综合利用项目原则上要与基本建设主体工程同时设计、同时施工、同时投产。
    二、新建和扩建项目申报单位提出的项目建议书，应明确规定相配套的资源综合利用的内容；勘察设计部门提出的可行性研究报告和初步设计要包括资源综合利用的规模、工艺等内容。凡不具备上述条件的，工程咨询部门不予咨询，各级主管单位和资源综合利用部门不予审批立项。
    三、资源综合利用项目所需投资应在主体工程投资中统筹考虑，也可另外筹措资金，但必须与主体工程一起纳入国家或地方的固定资产投资计划，并按照国家规定的审批和管理权限，由各级计委（计经委）、经委主管资源综合利用的部门、行业主管部门和投资公司负责在规划和年度计划中落实。
    四、资源综合利用项目，凡不执行同时施工规定的，有关部门不得批准开工。施工中有意减掉有关综合利用工程的，有关部门有权令其补建后再继续施工。
    五、资源综合利用项目应当与主体工程同时建成，交付使用。否则，主管部门不能对主体工程组织验收投产。对于分期建设、分期受益的主体工程，可以先部分投产，但全部工程必须与资源综合利用工程同时投产。
    六、由于历史原因造成资源利用不合理的，应把综合利用资源作为企业基本建设的重要内容，限期配套建设。
    七、由“三同时”建成的资源综合利用项目，享受有关的优惠政策。由企业自筹资金建设项目生产的产品，按照规定减免产品税；项目投产后，具备单位核算条件、独立计算盈亏的项目，在5年内免交所得税和调节税。
    八、国家计划委员会将根据需要不定期地调整《资源综合利用项目“三同时”目录》，集体和乡镇企业的新建和改扩建项目，在《资源综合利用项目“三同时”目录》范围内的，也要执行上述规定。
