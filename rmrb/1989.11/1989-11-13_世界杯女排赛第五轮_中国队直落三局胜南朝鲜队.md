The fifth round of the fifth World Cup women's volleyball tournament was held today at the Osaka Gymnasium. China, the Soviet Union, Cuba, and Japan each defeated South Korea, Peru, Canada, and East Germany respectively, all winning 3-0.

The Chinese team defeated South Korea with a lopsided score of 3-0 (15-3, 15-1, 15-5). South Korea did not show the same tenacity they had against the Soviet Union and Peru, appearing listless and lacking in fighting spirit. The Chinese team won in straight sets in just 50 minutes, making it the quickest match of the tournament so far.

The match between the Soviet Union and Peru, the gold and silver medalists from the 1988 Seoul Olympics, did not feature intense competition.

Cuba and Canada have had contrasting performances in this tournament. Cuba has won all their matches, while Canada has lost all theirs. In today's match, Cuba was overconfident, and the second set ended in a 14-14 tie. However, Cuba still managed to win 3-0 (15-9, 16-14, 15-6).

The match between Japan and East Germany was a classic example of Asian versus European playing styles. With the enthusiastic support of the crowd, the Japanese team, whose average height is about 8 cm shorter than their opponents, played aggressively and won 3-0 (15-7, 15-4, 15-5) against the strong European team from East Germany.

After five rounds, Cuba leads with a perfect record of 5-0. China and the Soviet Union both have 4-1 records. Japan stands at 3-2, Peru at 2-3, South Korea at 1-4, and Canada at 0-5.

The teams will have a rest day tomorrow and then move to Nagoya. On the 14th and 15th, China will face the Soviet Union and Japan respectively.

    世界杯女排赛第五轮
    中国队直落三局胜南朝鲜队
    本报大阪11月12日电　记者于青报道：第五届世界杯女排赛今天在大阪体育馆进行了第五轮比赛。中国、苏联、古巴和日本队分别战胜南朝鲜、秘鲁、加拿大和民主德国队，四场比赛的结果都是3∶0。
    中国队以3∶0（15∶3、15∶1、15∶5）的悬殊比分轻取南朝鲜队。南朝鲜队没有表现出对苏联和秘鲁队对阵时的顽强精神，显得毫无斗志，被中国队在50分钟内直落三局，成为迄今本届比赛用时最少的速决战。
    去年汉城奥运会女排冠亚军苏联和秘鲁队的比赛并没有出现激烈争夺的场面。
    而古巴队和加拿大队是本届比赛以来战绩截然相反的两队。古巴全胜、加拿大皆负。在今天的比赛中，古巴队过分轻敌，第二局竟打成14平。但是，最后古巴仍以3∶0（15∶9、16∶14、15∶6）战胜了对手。
    日本和民主德国队之间的比赛，是典型的亚洲打法与欧洲打法的抗衡，在观众狂热的声援下，平均身高低于对手约8厘米的日本队，打得积极主动，以15∶7、15∶4、15∶5连拿三局，战胜欧洲女排劲旅民主德国队。
    至今已赛罢五轮，古巴队5战全胜，中国队和苏联队4胜1负，日本队3胜2负，秘鲁队2胜3负，南朝鲜队1胜4负，加拿大队5战皆负。
    明天停赛一天，8支女排将移师名古屋。14、15日两天中国队分别与苏联队和日本队交手。
