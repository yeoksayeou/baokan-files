On October 25, during the "Uruguay Round" multilateral trade negotiations held in Geneva, the United States proposed a new initiative. The proposal advocates converting non-tariff barriers in agricultural trade into tariffs, with the aim of gradually eliminating or significantly reducing them. The U.S. proposed to abolish export subsidies for agricultural products within five years and to eliminate all forms of domestic financial support linked to production and pricing within ten years. This proposal sparked a strong reaction from the European Community. On October 26 in Brussels, Ray MacSharry, the European Community's Commissioner for Agriculture, expressed his "deep disappointment" with the U.S. new proposal. MacSharry stated that in April of this year, the U.S. had announced the abandonment of its demand to eliminate all agricultural subsidies within ten years. Therefore, Washington's new proposal represents a step backward.

    欧美在农产品贸易问题上再起争执
    10月25日，在日内瓦举行的“乌拉圭回合”多边贸易谈判中，美国提出一项新建议，主张把农产品贸易中的非关税壁垒化为关税，以便逐步将之消除或基本消除。美国提出，在5年内取消对农产品出口的补贴，在10年内取消一切形式的与生产和价格相连的国内财政支持。这一建议激起了欧洲共同体方面的强烈反应。共同体委员会农业问题的委员雷·麦克谢里在当月26日布鲁塞尔表示，他对美国的新建议“深感失望”。麦克谢里说，今年4月美国曾宣布放弃在10年内取消一切农业补贴的要求，因而华盛顿提出的新建议是一种退步。
