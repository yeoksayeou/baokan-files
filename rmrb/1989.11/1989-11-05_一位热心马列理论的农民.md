A farmer in Nanshi Village, Nanhe County, Hebei Province, named Cheng Zhuohua, is 33 years old and a high school graduate. In 1979, he served as the production team leader and was one of the earliest to implement the household contract responsibility system. Some people criticized him for taking a step backward and wanted to revoke it. Later, when the policy allowed it, the masses were still worried that the policy might change, and he himself also had doubts. At this time, he began to study works such as "Introduction to Scientific Socialism," "Political Economy," and "Capital," seeking answers within them. His studies made him realize that the "iron rice bowl" was not socialism and that the household contract responsibility system was not a temporary measure. From then on, he promoted the responsibility system with greater confidence.

In 1984, he became the party branch secretary and felt that the scattered land plots were hindering production development and the adjustment of planting structures. He wanted to consolidate the land into larger plots, but the soil quality and conditions varied. To address this, he applied the theory of "differential rent" from "Capital" and wrote an article titled "On the Improvement of the Household Contract Responsibility System in Rural Areas and the Application of Marx's Theory of Differential Rent." He proposed using the method of "differential rent" to solve the problem of adjusting land plots with different soil qualities and conditions. This article was praised and supported by the president of the National "Capital" Research Association. In 1986, the association specially invited Cheng Zhuohua to participate in the third annual meeting of the National Party School System "Capital" Research Association held in Taiyuan. Cheng Zhuohua's article was read at the meeting and received prolonged applause. A professor commented at the meeting that this was the first article to combine Marx's theory of differential rent with the rural responsibility system. The executive committee unanimously decided to admit Cheng Zhuohua as a member of the National Party School System "Capital" Research Association. He became the first farmer member of the association.

Cheng Zhuohua's enthusiasm for studying Marxism-Leninism grew even stronger after becoming a member. In less than a year, he wrote eleven articles combining rural reform practices and organized a theoretical study and research group of twelve farmers in his village.

In January 1988, Cheng Zhuohua was exceptionally selected to study at the Xingtai Municipal Party School's undergraduate class. In over a year, he wrote more than thirty articles and graduated with excellent results.

Last February, he compiled his articles into a 140,000-word manuscript titled "An Initial Discussion on Rural Reform and Land Economy."

After the manuscript was sent to the publisher, it was quickly accepted. Provincial, municipal, and county leaders were very concerned upon hearing the news. Provincial Party Secretary Ying Chongzhi, after reading Cheng Zhuohua's manuscript, happily wrote the book's title.

    一位热心马列理论的农民
    河北南和县南师村农民程柱华，今年三十三岁，高中毕业。一九七九年，他当生产队长，较早地搞起了大包干，有人指责他是走回头路，要收回。后来政策允许了，群众还怕政策变，他心里也犯嘀咕。这时，他开始学习《科学社会主义概论》、《政治经济学》和《资本论》等著作，想从中寻找答案。学习使他明白了“大锅饭”不是社会主义，大包干不是权宜之计。从此，他推行责任制更加理直气壮了。
    一九八四年他任党支部书记，感到责任田地块零碎成了影响生产发展和种植结构调整的障碍。他想一户调整成一块地，可是土质、条件又不一样。针对这种情况，他运用《资本论》关于“级差地租”的理论，写了一篇题为《谈农村土地联产承包责任制的完善与马克思级差地租理论的应用》的论文，提出了用“级差地租”的办法解决因土质、条件不同难以调整地块的问题。这篇论文受到全国《资本论》研究会会长的赞扬和支持，一九八六年，研究会特邀程柱华参加在太原召开的全国党校系统《资本论》研究会第三届年会。程柱华的论文在年会上宣读后，引起长时间的掌声。一位教授在会上评议说，这是把马克思级差地租理论与农村责任制结合起来的第一篇文章。经理事会讨论，一致通过吸收程柱华为全国党校系统《资本论》研究会会员。他成为该会第一个农民会员。
    程柱华当了会员，研究马列的劲头更足了，不到一年时间，就结合农村改革实际写了十一篇论文，并在本村组织了十二位农民参加的理论学习研究小组。
    一九八八年一月份，程柱华被破例选送到邢台地委党校大专班学习。一年多时间，他又写出三十多篇论文，并以优异的成绩获得大专文凭。
    去年二月，他把自己的论文整理成一部十四万字的《初论农村改革与土地经济》的书稿。
    书稿送到出版社后，很快定了稿。省、地、县领导同志得知这一消息，非常关心。省委书记邢崇智看过程柱华的书稿后，欣然命笔，为该书题写了书名。
