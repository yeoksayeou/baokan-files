According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 25th (Reporter Chen Yan) With the approval of the State Council, China will begin a nationwide boundary survey pilot program starting now.

Zhang Dejiang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, revealed today that the administrative boundaries between provinces and counties in China, which have never been surveyed in history, are expected to be legally fixed within the next 10 years or so.

Zhang Dejiang made these remarks at the opening of the National Boundary Survey Pilot Program Working Conference held today. The conference was jointly organized by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the State Land Administration, and the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping. The heads of the civil affairs, land management, and surveying departments of the 9 provinces and autonomous regions approved by the State Council to conduct the boundary survey pilot program attended the meeting. These regions include Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Gansu, Jilin, Henan, and Shandong.

According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs' investigation and analysis of the current state of provincial-level boundaries, there are a total of 65 provincial-level land boundaries nationwide, approximately 52,000 kilometers long. Among these, about 5% are legally defined boundaries, 77% are customary boundaries, and 18% are disputed boundaries. Currently, the administrative boundaries on various maps in China are basically drawn according to customary boundaries. Therefore, disputes arising from unclear boundaries have frequently occurred, seriously affecting social stability, unity, and the normal progress of the Four Modernizations.

With the approval of the State Council, starting this year, the boundary survey pilot program will be carried out in 9 provinces and autonomous regions nationwide, followed by a nationwide rollout. The total length of the pilot boundaries is approximately 5,000 kilometers, with a planned completion time of 3 years.

Zhang Dejiang pointed out in his speech that this boundary survey is not a readjustment of administrative divisions but is based on the current state of administrative divisions. It aims to define legal boundaries, resolve disputed boundaries, legalize customary boundaries, and establish boundary markers in the field.

　　经国务院批准
　　9省区开始勘界试点
　　核定法定线　解决争议线　法定习惯线
    据新华社北京11月25日电　（记者陈雁）经国务院批准，从现在开始，我国将进行全国勘界试点。
    民政部副部长张德江今天在此间透露，我国有史以来从未勘定过的省与省、县与县之间的行政区域界线，可望在今后10年左右用法律的形式固定下来。
    张德江是在今天开幕的全国勘界试点工作会议上讲这番话的。这次会议是由民政部、国家土地管理局、国家测绘局联合召开的。经国务院批准进行勘界试点的宁夏、内蒙古、新疆、青海、陕西、甘肃、吉林、河南、山东9省、自治区主管勘界工作的民政、土地管理、测绘部门的负责人出席了会议。
    根据民政部对省级边界现状的调查分析，全国省级陆路边界线共有65条，约52000公里，其中法定线约5％，习惯线占77％，争议线占18％。目前我国各类地图上行政区域的界线，基本上是按习惯线画的。因此，由边界不清引起的争议不断发生，已严重地影响了社会的安定团结和四化建设的正常进行。
    经国务院批准，从今年起在全国9省、区首先进行勘界试点，然后在全国铺开。试点界线总长约5000公里，计划3年完成。
    张德江在讲话中指出，这次勘界不是重新调整行政区划，而是以行政区划现状为基础，核定法定线，解决争议线，法定习惯线，并在实地树立界桩。
