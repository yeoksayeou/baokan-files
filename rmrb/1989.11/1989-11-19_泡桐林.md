The Yellow River, originating from the Kunlun Mountains, meanders through nine bends before emptying into the sea. "One stone of river water, six measures of sand." Each year, it carries 1.6 billion tons of silt, which, if stacked in cubic meters, could circle the Earth's equator 27 times!

The muddy Yellow Dragon bursts out of the Mengshan Gorge, suddenly facing a vast plain. Thus, since the time of Yu the Great, it has rampaged and rolled, leaving a long and desolate trail. Historical records show that in the past 2,500 years of the Republic, the Yellow River has breached its banks over 1,500 times and changed its course 26 times, leaving behind undulating sand dunes and vast expanses of saline-alkali land. By 1938, the tragedy reached a peak: the Nationalist army, following orders, blew up the Huayuankou Dam in Zhengzhou. With a thunderous roar, a wall of water surged southeast, engulfing 54,000 square kilometers of land. The Henan-Hubei-Anhui plain became the "Yellow Flood Zone," shocking the world. In the early days of liberation, it was still a vast expanse of sand, marshes, reeds, and weeds, with wild rabbits darting through the undergrowth and vultures circling over bleached bones...

The fierce winds from Siberia howl through the pass between the Taihang Mountains and the Taishan Mountains in the east, striking the central plains with ferocious force. They meet the winds from the Yellow River gorge, swirling and spinning across the unobstructed plains, creating countless vortices that shake the heavens and earth. They whip up clouds of sand that blot out the sun and moon. The sky is dark and chaotic, the earth yellow and shattered. All living things are like tiny grains of sand, tossed and tormented by the wind. Not to mention the wheat seedlings being uprooted and blown away, even sand dunes the size of several acres can roll dozens of meters in a single night. The wind and sand have buried ancient cities and forced villages to relocate time and time again...

At an international conference in India in 1950, foreigners predicted: "Even the North China Plain might turn into a desert."

The wind and sand seemed to pay no heed to the young republic...

However, unexpectedly, vast expanses of green poplar forests stood tall on the plains, like the unyielding people of the central plains who have fought against the wind and sand for thousands of years.

The Green Spirit Creates Miracles

On the morning of October 30, 1952, the sunrise cast a glow over the Yellow River levee in Dongba Town, Lanxian. A tall figure stood out against the dry grass and frost. Chairman Mao stepped on the frozen ground, facing the Yellow River, gazing far into the distance. The vast river flowed endlessly, its yellow waters surging beneath his feet, making a sharp turn and rushing northeast. This was where the Yellow River last changed its course during the Qing Dynasty's Xianfeng era. He stood there for a long time, only such a vast river flowing through the heavens and earth could match his mood, his heart, and his spirit. He walked to the water's edge, scooped up a handful of silt, and looked at it carefully, his brows furrowed. "We must do something about the Yellow River," he said, his words also summoning the green spirit. Thus, along the Yellow River and its old course, row upon row of protective forests stretched for hundreds of kilometers, forming a green Great Wall on the central plains.

In the vast fields, the most striking sight, forming a magnificent biological protective system, was the wind-resistant, sand-blocking poplar forests.

The central plains are the homeland of the poplar. The "Catalogue of Poplars" by Chen Zhu of the Northern Song Dynasty praised the poplar as the king of trees. Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" valued every part of the poplar, from its roots, bark, leaves, and flowers, all of which can be used as medicine, with a bitter and cold taste, having the effects of reducing swelling, detoxifying, promoting hair growth, and treating bronchitis and pneumonia. Moreover, the poplar, as a green warrior, has significant ecological, social, and economic benefits, or even a fourth benefit, aesthetic value. It grows quickly, has excellent quality, and is highly resilient. A single seed or a piece of root can quickly grow into a tree. Its extensive and robust root system penetrates deep into the earth, with deep roots and lush foliage, a strong trunk, and flourishing branches, standing firm against the onslaught of wind and sand. It is the flag of green.

If you step out of the Yellow Earth of the northwest, or shake off the northern snow, and walk into the central plains in the spring, it is not an exaggeration to say that you have entered a vast garden of poplar forests. The poplar forests are scientifically and orderly, with 5 meters between each tree and 40-50 meters between each row, dividing the land into a grid pattern, creating a sense of group beauty. Within the frames, the wheat fields ripple with green waves, the rapeseed flowers are bright and dazzling, and the sky is filled with clouds of poplar flowers, white and purple, clustered and fragrant. If seen from an airplane, the earth is covered with a sea of colorful clouds, endless and boundless. Who would say it is not the largest and most beautiful garden in the world?

But the most beautiful time is in the summer. The poplar forests present a green group beauty. Straight trunks, graceful branches, and large green leaves, all neatly arranged. The vast plain is a sea of green that cannot be seen through. Within the frames, the five grains grow happily and vigorously, the fruit trees are lush, and the time and space are utilized intensively. Even the Great Sand River, which flows through the Yellow Flood Zone, has been beautifully landscaped. The levees are lined with poplar trees and willows, the white wax trees have drooping branches, the yellow flowers are in full bloom, and the layers of green form a deep and lovely combination. When the chrysanthemums bloom on the banks, this "water park" is even more beautiful. The villages? Some people have said of their greenery: "At night, you can't see the moonlight; looking up, you can't see the stars." The tree-lined paths in the fields, with poplar branches intertwined, form a green corridor. "In the summer, you don't need to wear a straw hat; in the rain, you won't get wet." The sunlight filters through the leaves, also turning into cool green light. The trees have dyed the people green, and their hearts have turned green.

Delegations from 55 countries around the world sighed in admiration amidst the green ocean. "The Chinese people are the masters of transforming nature!" said a French expert. "What we have seen in the plains of Henan Province far exceeds the wonder of the Great Wall in China. Here, my concern that the world might turn into a desert has been proven wrong," said a member of the Indian delegation.

The poplar has changed the climate, creating a good ecological environment. Scientific measurements show that the wind speed in the agricultural and forestry interplanting areas has decreased by 45-55%, the relative humidity has increased by 10-20%, the evaporation rate has decreased by 20-30%, the summer temperature has dropped by 2-3°C, and the winter temperature has increased by 1-3°C. The troublesome hot and dry winds have disappeared, and wheat production has increased by 30-40%. The poplar is a good teacher for raising ecological awareness and greening consciousness, reminding people: those who cut down trees will be severely punished by nature.

The poplar is the nurturer of agriculture and animal husbandry, promoting a virtuous cycle. The leaves and flowers are good feed. The livestock, in turn, nourish the land.

The poplar has achieved the greening of the plains. When the forests in the mountainous areas were severely destroyed and the forest situation deteriorated, the poplar flourished. The forest coverage rate increased from almost zero before liberation to 14.8%, and in some plain areas, it increased to 20-30%. The province has 33 million mu of farmland forest networks and 29.8 million mu of agricultural and forestry interplanting areas, with 400 million poplar trees, with an annual growth of 8 million cubic meters.

The poplar wood is of good quality, light, moisture-resistant, and non-deformable, making it an excellent material for furniture. In Japan, young people consider poplar wood furniture a symbol of nobility and honor. Poplar wood has good acoustic properties and strong resonance, making it an excellent material for musical instruments, with wide applications in the aviation, shipbuilding, and papermaking industries. The artificial forests on the plains are a vast timber base and a "green bank." One poplar tree grows 10 yuan a year. In 1988, Fuzhou County, the heart of the Yellow Flood Zone, cut down 120,000 cubic meters of wood, and there were 47 households in Baotun Township who became millionaires by selling trees. Every day, trucks loaded with wood travel endlessly on the roads. A deputy minister of the Forestry Department exclaimed: "A single county is more enthusiastic than a forestry bureau!"

The trees are lush, the grains are plentiful, and the six domestic animals thrive. However, appreciating a painting, if you do not understand its background and the artist, you understand only half of it, or even less.

The First Generation of Poplar Kings

On October 13, 1989, I paid my respects to the tomb of martyr Jiao Yulu in the morning mist. It is located on a sand dune north of Lanxian County, now a lush martyr's cemetery. Climbing the steps, among the green pines and cypresses stands a white marble tombstone, with Jiao Yulu's portrait embedded at the top. A few strands of dawn light filter through the poplar leaves, casting a faint red glow on his gaunt face. His thick black hair, straight nose, and bright eyes seem to be in deep thought—

Is he recalling the difficult years of fighting against sand burial, alkali, and the "three disasters"? Or is he lost in a hazy dream and longing?

"When I die, bury me on the sand dune... and watch you transform the sand dune..." "If I do not change the face of Lanxian, I will not close my eyes in peace!"

He was only 42 years old when he passed away, and today it has been 25 years. The green spirits, if they knew, would all protect him dearly. Rows of willows stand in formation in front of him, and the 14 poplar trees he planted personally stand solemnly behind him. The surrounding poplar forests interlace and overlap, forming a green curtain for him. The willows and wintergreen call out to the red clouds to weave a brocade...

Looking down at the vast changes in Lanxian, 7 million poplar trees, what a magnificent sight! In Jiao Yulu's initiative to "reverse the silt, press the sand, plant trees, and create forests, applying ointments and acupuncture to the sandy and alkaline wasteland," the poplar was at the forefront. "The poplar is a great treasure of Lanxian, with a bright future." Today's lush poplar forests, are they not yesterday's dreams? On the old course, 261 sand dunes have become green forests, 280,000 mu of sandy wasteland have been transformed into fertile fields, and in the past decade, 200 million kilograms of patriot grain have been produced. The 100,000 mu of saline-alkali pits have been built into a cotton base...

Overlooking these changes is an old poplar tree. It is the "guide" of the "Poplar Museum," containing a history of the plains' greening. It stands like a green peak, towering over the village north of the city. The stone tablet reads: "Jiao's Poplar." Dear reader, do you remember the photo of Jiao Yulu with a small poplar sapling? He stood with his hands on his hips, wearing a jacket, seemingly still with sweat on his head and breathing heavily, smiling at the sapling he planted with his own hands, his eyes filled with affection and hope. It was so small, like a child's arm, with a few tender leaves, and its back was not very straight... In the blink of an eye, the sapling has grown into a tree that two people cannot embrace, with sprawling branches like a giant umbrella, 17 meters east to west and 16 meters north to south. Its majestic figure under the blue sky and white clouds is awe-inspiring. This is what people call the first-generation poplar king. I embraced it, my heart against its green veins, to understand the philosophy of life and feel the flow of its emotions...

"Comrade Jiao led the way in planting trees, and only then did the sandstorms subside." Old farmer Ye Chuanzhi, who planted trees with Jiao Yulu, looked up at the "Jiao's Poplar," his eyes shining with deep remembrance. Memories are both sweet and bitter, like the rough lines intertwined: "In the past, I went begging every year, I couldn't even look like a human, I just wanted to save my life. 'The big brother of Lanxian goes begging, and the whole country knows Lanxian County,' my face was shameful, and my heart ached! On the way, my youngest son suddenly fell ill, and I watched him die in my arms..." The old man's eyes welled up with tears, and he sighed deeply, affectionately stroking the poplar trunk, "This year, I harvested more than 3,000 kilograms of wheat and more than 2,000 kilograms of peanuts. Three sons have all married. I also planted more than forty poplar trees in my responsibility field. The poplar is my savior, my money tree!"

Lanxian has made a fortune from the poplar. Annual logging reaches 20,000 cubic meters, and foreign merchants' eyes are fixed on the Lanxian poplar, earning 19 million yuan in foreign exchange each year. Even the scraps and waste are treasures. Half of the households in Kongchang Village are engaged in poplar wood processing, producing small electrical appliances like scissors boxes, with more than ten products selling well in fourteen provinces and cities, with an average income of over a thousand yuan per person. "The big brother of Lanxian" has become the "ambassador of Lanxian," active throughout the country. "Don't say Lanxian is poor, Lanxian has poplars, poplars go abroad, and the world knows."

Life is comfortable, and the folk songs are lively, "In the past, it was troublesome to enter the door, troublesome to go out, troublesome to the end," "Today, there is no worry about eating or wearing, two eyes are fixed on the department store." A group of girls dressed in red and green ride motorcycles on the tree-lined paths, their laughter is so happy, hearing it makes one's heart tremble; the mud-brick huts have become two-story buildings, a blend of Chinese and Western styles, pleasing to the eye. In the county, 98% of the households have moved into new brick houses...

Today, this common sight, perhaps Jiao Yulu could not have imagined it in his dreams!

It is under the inspiration of Jiao Yulu's spirit that Lanxian has poplar forests everywhere and has conducted fruitful scientific exploration in agricultural and poplar interplanting, pioneering the way for the country.

Those who plant green on the earth, their lives will also be evergreen.

The Second Generation of Poplar Kings

To the east of Lanxian is Minquan County, named after Sun Yat-sen's "people's rights," now known as the "oasis." The Yellow River's old course stretches 40 kilometers across the county, wide and bright, with shallow and clear marshes. Two small boats are moored by the water, reeds and cattails are lush, and occasionally wild ducks fly up. To the north, on the levee, five poplar trees stand tall, overseeing the vast old course. These are the second-generation poplar kings, with an average height of 20.6 meters and a single tree volume of 4.3 cubic meters, still 20 centimeters short of being embraced by two people.

In their towering shadows and the green smiles of their descendants, people seem to see the figure of old forestry bureau chief Li Guiping. Who in Minquan County does not know "Old Poplar Root"? The thin and frail man struggled to climb onto his old bicycle, which rattled everywhere except the bell, facing the blinding wind and sand, from one village to another, like a struggling eagle. In the breeding rooms, in the courtyards of farmers' homes, and in today's sea of green, under the sunlight and clouds, his hearty laughter and humorous folk songs still echo: "A poplar grows one meter a year, three years like an umbrella, five years can be sawed into boards," "There are no forests in the sandy areas, and the land cannot support people," "To get rich, plant poplar trees."... The handlebars of his bicycle still hang a handkerchief bag, wrapped with two dry buns, and when hungry, he would take a bite. The dawn light captured him planting trees with the people in the cold wind and frost... During the Cultural Revolution, he was criticized and struggled against, but he would take off his dunce cap and plant trees. During the day, he was criticized, and at night, he planted trees. In the vast night, under the dark blue sky, a frail figure and the small saplings were forever etched in people's minds... "To benefit the people of the present and create a future for the descendants!" This was the boundless energy hidden in his frail body. Long-term overwork led to illness, and his face turned yellow. "You should go to the hospital quickly!" his comrades advised him. "Let me finish this busy period first!" But he never had a moment to rest. Directing the county's tree-planting, he covered his stomach with pain, sweating profusely on the tree roots, almost fainting... The doctor on the operating table was shocked, the cancer had spread throughout his abdomen! He sensed that the grim reaper was approaching, and every day he let his daughter-in-law and daughter pull him in a cart to see the nursery. The seedlings grew well, and his eyes shone with unusual brightness: "There is hope! There is hope!" The nursery workers were so moved that they cried: "Old Bureau Chief, you don't need to come anymore, you can rest assured!" The county leaders came to visit him, and his first concern was to implement the county's greening plan; the second thing was: "I didn't finish planting the trees, let my son also go into forestry, and continue planting..." Until his last moments, the last flicker of life's candle, he still murmured: "Poplar root... poplar root..." This was the testament of an ordinary person left to the world on October 17, 1981.

This is another Jiao Yulu of the central plains.

Not just Li Guiping! In the early 1980s, the green movement swept across the central plains. In 1980, Xinzheng County first implemented the policy of "trees follow the land, whoever plants owns it," greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses. In 1983, Yuxian County learned from Xinzheng and became the first in the country to achieve plain greening in one year. The provincial party committee and government vigorously promoted Yuxian County's experience of concentrating forces, unified planning, and unified planting. In 1985, Shangqiu Region was the first in the country to achieve regional greening. The fourth meeting of the National Greening Commission was held in Henan, and Comrade Wanli rushed to Shangqiu in the rain to personally present the "National Advanced Greening Unit" award. By 1989, the province had already had 6 cities and 67 counties (districts) that had reached the national greening standards. The provincial party committee and government proposed the strategic goal of "greening the plains in three years and greening the mountains in ten years."

Minquan County, a model of vertical forestry, is famous for its grapes between the poplar trees, known as the top grape base county in the country. Grapes have also brought a series of industrial projects, including winemaking, canning, beverages, and packaging. Minquan Wine Factory's grape wine won one gold medal and six silver medals from the state, and was exported to 14 countries and regions. Isn't this the dream of Li Guiping in his dying moments!

The Poplar United Nations

"Small poplars, achieving great deeds. The green group is creating great things." Professor Jiang Jianping, the president of Henan Agricultural University and a poplar expert, gave me serious thoughts.

Yuzhou City is the land of Yu the Great, the hometown of the world-renowned painter Wu Daozi, and the famous capital of Jun porcelain. The Yuyang River meanders down from the southern side of Mount Song, carrying ancient history, and nurturing today's green culture. In the fields of Hexi Village, along the riverbank, there is a 2-kilometer-wide poplar interplanting forest covering 1,300 mu. Outsiders see the spectacle, insiders see the essence. It attracted 250 experts from 55 countries to visit and study, and the United Nations magazine frequently reported on its information.

This is currently the world's famous poplar gene bank, collecting all poplar varieties from home and abroad, a priceless national treasure.

A Japanese expert, Takeuchi, said enviously: "Your country's poplar research is world-leading, and I have never seen such a large-scale formal research in rural areas, with high standards, complete varieties, and advanced technology."

At the World Forestry Conference held in Argentina in 1972, someone asked the director of the Chinese Academy of Forestry, Wu Zhonglun: "Your country's poplars are very good, we want some seeds, but we don't know what varieties you have?"

Wu Zhonglun was at a loss for words. As soon as he returned to the country, he found Jiang Jianping: "I lost face at the international conference, I don't know the varieties of poplars, what kind of expert am I?"

Jiang Jianping's heart surged with a wave of emotion: "The small poplar has gained an advantage in the international arena. Italy's poplar, Australia's pine, China's poplar! Professor Wu lost face, it's our fault for not being aware. Not recognizing the true face of Mount Lu, only because we are in the mountain. We should strengthen our research." Thus, the poplar breeding and high-yield cultivation cooperation group was established, with dozens of units and over 100 people participating.

"A single poplar is insignificant, but a million trees form a group, and they can transform nature and create a great climate. The group is important. An individual is insignificant, but a group can produce great wisdom and power." Jiang Jianping was pleased that "I have a group of good friends, not competing for fame and profit, a common cause brings us together. There are also good poplar bases."

One of the good friends is Lu Xitang, the director of the Yuzhou City Forestry Technology Promotion Center, and a group of farmer brothers.

In 1960, China was experiencing a severe natural disaster, stepping on the early spring frost and dry grass, he and Lu Xitang came to the riverbank, starting experiments in the desolate river slope. Living in a cave, their bodies were swollen, but the selected varieties "Yu Xuan 1" and "Yu Za 1" had their character, strong adaptability, vigorous vitality, disease resistance, rapid growth, good type, and late flowering. Next, human pruning and grafting were successful, cultivating high-stem, knot-free high-quality materials, improving the artistic and economic value of poplars, and quickly promoting them nationwide. Both items won the second prize for scientific and technological achievements from the Forestry Department.

They were making the best choices, selecting excellent varieties, and choosing the best value in life. They cultivated the poplars, and the poplars also cultivated them. His three generations of graduate students have all become outstanding poplar experts, some of whom are outstanding scientific and technological workers in the province. "The poplar and our fate are closely related."

Jiang Jianping's "Poplar Cultivation" has been published by the China Forestry Publishing House. This is the first comprehensive work on poplars since the ancient "Catalogue of Poplars."

In 1984, the Chinese Poplar Research Center was established in Zhengzhou.

At another World Forestry Conference, Wu Zhonglun's topic was "Poplar and the greening of the Chinese plains." The Chinese poplar won the favor of international scholars.

The poplar industry is developing on Chinese soil. In the late 1980s, the poplar marched westward into the highlands. The poplar roots of Henan, with tens of millions of trees, entered Shaanxi and Shanxi, and the drought-resistant varieties performed well in Gansu. The poplar challenged the cold, drought, and deserts of the northwest with a heroic posture. It can be seen in 22 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country. The Forestry Department plans to develop 21 billion trees nationwide, with a 10-year rotation period, 60 million cubic meters of timber per year. Henan already accounts for 1/5, with the number of trees, area, volume, and export value all ranking first in the country. The largest poplar processing plant in China is being built in Shangqiu.

"Small poplars, developing into a magnificent green industry. Small things have great significance." President Jiang talked about dialectics. "But the exploration and cultivation of poplars are endless. Its potential is still great."

"I have dedicated my life to the poplar. My life is limited, but the life of the poplar is endless." This old intellectual, who left the clear waters and green mountains of the Ganjiang River in the 1950s and took root in the central plains, had hopes and new worries. In 1989, the university enrolled 670 students, with only 87 choosing it as their first choice, the lowest in history.

"National rejuvenation must start from agriculture and forestry. Trees must first be planted. If people are not planted, how can this green industry be sustained and developed?" He left a long question mark...

    泡桐林
    张惠芳
    黄河，出昆仓之墟，九曲注入海。“一石河水六斗沙”。它每年裹挟的16亿吨泥沙按立方米排起来，能绕地球赤道27圈！
    混浊的黄龙冲出邙岭峡谷，前面蓦然一片辽阔的平原，于是在大禹之后的历史上，它肆无忌惮地奔突、翻滚，留下了漫长苍凉的足迹。历史有载，自民国上朔2500年间，黄河决口1500多次，改道26次，在故道甩下绵延起伏的沙丘和茫茫无际的盐碱地。到了1938年6月，悲剧又陡起高潮：国民党部队奉命竟然掘开郑州花园口大堤，轰隆一声炸响，如墙高的浪涛直下东南，吞没五万四千平方公里的土地，豫皖苏大平原出现了震惊世界的“黄泛区”。解放初期，这里还是一望无际的黄沙、沼泽、芦苇、蒿莱，野兔在草莽间出没，秃鹫在白骨上盘旋……
    从西伯利亚呼啸而来的狂飚，经过太行山东麓和齐鲁泰山相夹的大风口，以凌厉之势直袭中原，又和从黄河峡谷西来的风相遇，在无阻无拦的平原上冲撞、狂旋，卷无数涡流，撼天掀地；扬漫天黄沙，遮日蔽月。天冥冥其混沌兮，地苍黄而摧裂。一切生灵如同被狂风肆意抛洒欺凌的小沙粒。且不说麦苗被连根拔起，随风飞舞，就是几十亩大的沙丘亦如弹丸，一夜之间能滚动数十米。风沙曾埋住历史上的城市，又逼得一个个村庄不断迁徙……
    1950年在印度举行的国际会议上，外国人预言：“连华北大平原也可能变成沙漠。”
    风沙似乎没把年轻的共和国放在眼里……
    然而，出其不意，大平原上崛然树起一片片绿色的泡桐林，如同千百年来不屈不挠与风沙搏斗的中原人民迎风挺立……
    绿色精灵创造着奇迹
    1952年10月30日清晨，霞光洒在兰考东坝头黄河大堤上，映出一个魁伟的身影。毛主席踩着枯草严霜，面对黄河，极目眺望，大河漫漫而来，烟波浩渺，浑黄的激流在他脚下陡地拐了个大弯，气势汹涌朝东北而去。这是黄河于清咸丰五年最后一次改道的地方。他久久凝视着茫茫河面，只有这种大河奔流天地浑然一体的壮阔气势才能衬托出他此时此刻的心绪、胸怀和豪情。他走到水边，俯身掬了一捧泥沙，细细地看，眉峰蹙起，“要把黄河的事情办好。”他说，这嘱咐也召唤着绿色的灵犀。于是，黄河两岸、漫漫故道，一条条防护林带郁郁葱葱，绵延数百公里，在中原大地筑起了绿色长城。
    而在广袤的田野上，最引人注目的，组成宏伟的生物防护工程体系的，还是那挡风抗沙的泡桐林。
    中原是泡桐的故乡。北宋陈翥所著《桐谱》一书，称泡桐为群树之冠。李时珍的《本草纲目》，视泡桐浑身都是宝。根、皮、叶、花均能入药，“味苦寒”，有“消肿毒、生发，治气管炎、肺炎”等功效。而泡桐作为绿色的勇士，更是有宏观的生态效益、社会效益和经济效益，抑或再加一条，观赏效益。它速生，质优，生命力极旺，繁殖力也强，一粒籽、一段根即可勃然成木。它发达粗壮的根系扎进大地深处，根深而叶茂，本固而枝荣，在风沙扑来时巍然屹立。它是绿色的旗帜。
    如果你走出西北风中的黄土地，或抖落掉身上的塞北雪，踏着春的脚步来到中原，毫不夸张地说，你走进了泡桐林组成的大花园。泡桐林科学而有规则，5米一株，40、50米一行，把大地画成一个个网格，形成一种群体美。画框里，麦海泛着碧绿的涟漪，油菜花黄灿灿地鲜亮耀眼，而空中则是泡桐花的云朵，白的、紫的，团团锦簇，飘着甜蜜的清香。若从飞机上鸟瞰，大地上浮动着彩色的云海，无边无际，谁说不是世界上最大最美的花园呢？
    而最美时要数夏日。泡桐林又呈现出绿色群体美。直直的干，潇洒的枝，宽大的绿叶，整整齐齐，大平原是望不透的绿。画框里五谷怡然自乐，蓬勃旺盛，果树青葱……林粮果欢聚一堂，时间、空间得到集约利用。连流经黄泛区的大沙河也经过精心打扮，堤上泡桐林和垂柳白杨相映，白蜡条枝叶婆娑，黄花菜含苞待放，层次交错的绿色联合体绿得深沉可爱。岸上秋菊盛开时，这“水上公园”就更美了。村庄呢，有人极言其绿：“黑夜不见灯光，抬头不见月亮”；田间纵横的林荫道，泡桐挽枝交柯，搭成绿色长廊，“炎夏不戴草帽，下雨不湿衣裳”，阳光从叶隙筛下，也滤成清凉的绿色。树把人也给染绿了，心给沁翠了。
    来自世界55个国家的考察团在绿色海洋中望树兴叹。“中国人民是改造自然的强者！”法国专家说。“我们在河南省平原地区所看到的树木远远超过了中国长城这个奇迹。在这里，我担忧世界将变成沙漠的想法被证明是错误的。”印度考察团的成员说。
    泡桐改变了气候，创造了良好的生态环境。科学测定，农林间作区风速降低45—55％，相对湿度提高10—20％，蒸发量减少20—30％，夏天温度降低2—3℃，冬天提高1—3℃。令人头疼的干热风不见了，小麦产量提高30—40％。泡桐是提高人们生态观念、绿化意识的良师，告诫人们：谁大砍树木，就要受到大自然的严惩。
    泡桐是农业、畜牧业的保姆，促成了良性循环。叶和花是好饲料。牲畜又滋养着土地。
    泡桐成就了平原林业。当山区森林惨遭杀伐林象衰缩时，泡桐蓬勃而起。林木覆盖率由建国前的近乎零上升到14.8％，有的平原地区增加到20－30％。全省农田林网3300万亩，农林间作面积2980万亩，4亿株泡桐，年生长量就是800多万立方米。
    泡桐材质好，轻，防潮耐腐，不变形，是做家具的上等材料，日本青年结婚，以桐木家具为显贵荣耀。桐木声学性好，共鸣性强，是制作乐器的良材，在航空、造船、造纸行业都有广泛的用途。平原人工林是庞大的木材基地和“绿色银行”。一棵桐树一年长10元。黄泛区腹心的扶沟县1988年间伐12万方，仅包屯乡卖树成万元户的就有47家。每天公路上拉木材的车辆络绎不绝。林业部一位副部长惊叹：一个县比一个林区林业局还来劲！
    林茂粮丰，六畜兴旺。然而，欣赏一幅画，如若不了解它的背景及其作者，充其量只看懂了一半甚至更少。
    第一代泡桐王
    1989年10月13日，朦朦晨曦中我拜谒了焦裕禄烈士之墓。它位于兰考县城北的沙丘上，如今这里成了林木葱茂的烈士陵园。拾阶而上，青松翠柏中竖立着汉白玉墓碑，墓碑上端嵌着焦裕禄的遗像。几缕朝霞穿过泡桐叶隙，给他消瘦的脸颊染上淡淡的红光。他浓密的黑发，挺秀的鼻梁，明亮的双目似还在默默沉思——
    是在回忆那压沙治碱与“三害”搏斗的艰难岁月？还是沉醉在朦胧的梦幻和憧憬之中？
    “……死了把我埋在沙丘上，……看着你们把沙丘治好……”“不改变兰考面貌，死不瞑目！”
    他去世时才42岁，今天已有25个年头了。绿色的精灵有知，都亲切地护卫着他，一排排白杨列成仪仗侍立于前，他亲手栽的14株泡桐庄严肃穆警卫于后。周围的泡桐林交臂叠翠为他搭成绿色的幕帐，垂柳、冬青召唤着红霞裁织云锦……
    再看兰考大地，700万株泡桐，多么可观的阵容！在焦裕禄发起“翻淤压沙，植树造林，给盐碱沙荒贴膏药、扎针”的绿色运动中，泡桐冲锋在前。“泡桐是兰考一大宝，很有发展前途。”今日郁郁葱葱的泡桐林，该不是昨日的梦幻？故道上261座沙丘已成绿林，28万亩沙荒洼地变成良田，10年来交爱国粮2亿多公斤，10万亩盐碱窝建成棉花基地……
    俯瞰这沧桑变化的有一株老泡桐。它是这
  “泡桐博物馆”的“讲解员”，装着一部平原绿化史。它像绿色的山峰巍巍然屹立于城北村头，石碑上赫然二字：“焦桐”。亲爱的读者，你还记得焦裕禄与一株小桐苗合影的照片吧，他两手叉腰，披着褂子，似乎还带着满头热汗和喘喘粗气，乐呵呵地望着亲手栽下的树苗，目光中充满爱怜和希冀。它是那样弱小，孩儿胳膊细，几片嫩嫩的叶，背也不太直……眨眼间，小苗苗已长成两人不能合抱的大树，舒展的枝叶像巨伞，东西长17米，南北16米，蓝天白云下的雄姿令人肃然起敬。这便是被人们称为的第一代泡桐王。我拥抱它，心贴着它的绿脉，好领悟生命的哲理，感受它缕缕情思的流动……
      “焦书记带头栽树，这风沙才算给镇住了。”当年跟焦裕禄一块栽树的老农叶传枝仰望
  “焦桐”，目光里闪烁着深深怀念。回忆有甜蜜也有辛酸，如同那粗糙的纹路叠错交织：“过去我年年去逃荒，说不上人模人样了，只求保住条命，‘兰考大爷去要饭，全国都知兰考县’，俺脸无光、心里痛啊！半路上小儿子得了暴病，我眼睁睁看着他死在怀里……”老人眼角闪出泪花，长长吁了口气，深情地抚摸着桐干，“今年我光小麦就收了三千多斤，花生二千多斤。三个儿子都娶了媳妇。我又在责任田栽了四十多棵泡桐。泡桐是俺的救命树、发财树啊！”
    兰考发了桐财。年采伐2万立方，外商的眼睛紧紧盯着兰桐，每年出口创汇190多万元，连边角废料都是宝贝。孔场村半数农家都搞桐木加工，生产闸刀盒之类的小电料，十几种产品畅销十四个省市，人均收入上千元，“兰考大爷”变成“兰考大使”活跃全国。“别说兰考穷，兰考出泡桐，泡桐走国外，天下都闻名。”
    日子过得舒坦，顺口溜也朗朗上口，“过去是进门愁，出门愁，愁来愁去没有头”，“今天是吃不愁，穿不愁，两眼盯着百货楼”。一群穿红着绿的姑娘骑着嘉陵摩托在林荫道上飞驰，笑声是那样开心，闻之令人心颤；那土坯茅屋变成二层小楼，中西合璧，观之又赏心悦目。全县98％的农户都住上新瓦房。……今日这习以为常的景象恐怕焦裕禄当年做梦也想不到吧！
    正是在焦裕禄精神的感召下，兰考才处处泡桐成林，并在农桐间作上进行了卓有成效的科学探索，在全国开了农桐间作的先河。
    凡是为大地栽下绿色的人，他们的生命也与绿色长存。
    第二代泡桐王
    兰考东的民权县，因孙中山的“民权”而得名，如今又称“绿洲”。黄河故道横穿县境40公里，坦坦荡荡，浅而明亮的沼泽，水边横着两只小船，芦苇、蒲草葱郁葳蕤，偶尔还有野鸭飞起。北面大堤上，五棵泡桐雄视百里故道。这是第二代泡桐王，平均身高20.6米，单株积材4.3立方，两人合抱还差20多厘米。
    在它顶天立地的身影里，和它子子孙孙绿色的笑容里，人们仿佛又看到了老林业局长李贵平的影子。民权县谁人不知“老桐根”？瘦骨伶仃的他吃力登着那辆除了铃不响全身都响的破车子，顶着迷眼的风沙，从这村到那村，像只奋力搏击的苍鹰。在饲养室，农家院户，在今天万绿丛中，天光云影的枝叶间，仍回荡着他当年朗朗的笑声和幽默的顺口溜：“泡桐一年一根杆，三年一篷伞，五年能锯板”，“沙区没有林，有地不养人”，“要得富，栽桐树”。……那自行车把上还挂着个手巾兜，包着两个干馍头，饿了啃两口。黎明的曙光摄下了他在寒风严霜里带着群众栽树的场景……文革中挨批斗，他高帽子一摘就栽树，白天挨斗夜里栽，茫茫夜色中，黛蓝的苍穹下，一个瘦弱的身影和那一棵棵小苗苗，永远印在人们脑海里……“要为当代人谋利，为子孙后代造福！”这是他病恹恹的躯体里蕴藏的无穷热能。长期积劳成疾，日渐病笃，脸色灰黄。“你赶紧去看病吧！”同志们劝他。“等忙过这阵子吧！”可是，他永远没有忙完的时候。指挥全县栽树，他捂着绞疼的胃硬撑着，连串的冷汗甩在树根下，几乎疼晕过去……手术台上的医生震惊了，癌瘤已满腹扩散！他觉察到死神已经逼近，每天让儿媳、女儿拉上架子车带他看苗圃。苗子长得欢，他两眼放出异样的亮光：“有希望了！有希望了！”苗圃的同志感动得直掉泪：“老局长，你不用来了，你放心吧！”县里领导来探望，他嘱托的第一件心事是实现全县绿化规划；第二件事是：“我没把树栽完，让我的儿子也转林业，接着栽下去……”直到弥留之际，生命的烛光最后闪亮的时刻，他依然口中喃喃：“桐根……桐根……”这是1981年10月17日一个普普通通的人留给世界的遗嘱。
    这是中原大地又一个焦裕禄。
    何止一个李贵平！80年代初，绿色运动的浪涛更是席卷中原。1980年新郑县首先实行了“树随地走，谁栽谁有”的好政策，大大调动了广大农民的积极性。1983年禹县学习新郑，在全国第一个一年实现平原绿化。省委、省政府大力推广禹县集中力量、统一规划、统一栽植的经验。1985年商丘地区又率先在全国实现全区绿化。中央绿化委员会第四次会议在河南召开，万里同志冒雨赶到商丘亲自颁发“全国绿化先进单位”的奖状。到1989年，全省先后已有6个地市67个县（区）达到国家规定的绿化标准。省委、省政府又提出“三年绿化平原、十年绿化荒山”的战略目标。
    先进之一的民权县是立体林业的典型，泡桐林间的葡萄全国闻名，为全国葡萄基地县之冠。葡萄又带起了酿酒、罐头、饮料、包装等系列化工程。民权酒厂的葡萄酒荣获国家一个金牌六个银牌，远销14个国家和地区。这不就是李贵平弥留之际的梦幻吗！
     泡桐联合国
     “小小泡桐，成就着大业。绿色的群体进行着伟大的创造。”河南农业大学校长、泡桐专家蒋建平教授带给我认真的思考。
    禹州市乃夏禹封地，百代画圣吴道子的故乡，享誉世界的钧瓷之都。颍水从中岳嵩山之阳蜿蜒而下，带着古老的历史逶迤东南，又哺育着今日的绿色文化。在褚河乡河西岸的田野里，东西2公里一片泡桐间作林，1300亩。外行看热闹，内行看门道。它吸引来55个国家250名专家前来参观考察，联合国的杂志不时关注它的信息。
    这是目前世界著名的泡桐基因库，收集了国内外所有的泡桐品种，是国家的无价之宝。
    日本专家竹野羡慕地说：“贵国泡桐研究是世界领先的，农村这么大面积的正规研究从没见过，标准高、品种全、技术先进。”
    1972年在阿根廷召开的世界林业会上，有人问中国林科院院长吴中伦：“你们中国的泡桐很好，我们想要些种子，但不知都有什么品种？”
    吴中伦竟一时语结。一回国，他即找到蒋建平：
  “国际会上我算丢了脸，泡桐品种心中无数，还算什么专家？”
    蒋建平心中翻起一股热浪：“小小泡桐在国际上取得了优势。意大利的杨，澳大利亚的松，中国的泡桐！吴教授丢了脸，怨我们尚不自觉。不识庐山真面目，只缘身在此山中。我们应该加强研究。”于是，泡桐良种选育丰产栽培协作组成立了，几十个单位100多人参加。
      “一棵泡桐是渺小的，但千万株组成群体，就能改造大自然，形成大气候。群体很重要。一个人是渺小的，但组成群体，就能产生伟大的智慧和力量。”蒋建平引以快慰的是，“我有一帮好朋友，不争名争利，共同的事业把大家联在一起。还有好的泡桐基地。”
    好朋友之一是禹州市林业技术推广中心主任吕喜堂和一批农民兄弟。
    1960年，中国大地经历着严重自然灾害的袭劫，踏着早春的严霜与枯草，他和吕喜堂来到褚河岸边，在荒凉的河坡搞起试验。住在破窑洞里，浑身浮肿，但选育的良种“豫选一号”、“豫杂一号”却具有他们的性格，适应性强，生命力旺，抗病速生，干型好，晚花。接着，人工剪梢接干又获成功，培育高干无节良材，提高了泡桐的工艺价值和经济价值，很快推广全国。两项均获林业部科技成果二等奖。
    他们在进行最佳选择，选出了良种，也选择了人生最佳价值。他们培育了泡桐，泡桐也培育了他们。他的三代研究生都成了有为的泡桐专门家，有的是省优秀科技工作者。泡桐和我们命运息息相关。”
    蒋建平主编的《泡桐栽培学》已由中国林业出版社出版。这是继古人《桐谱》之后的第一部泡桐大全。
    1984年，中国的泡桐研究中心在郑州建立。
    在又一次世界林业会议上，吴中伦发言的专题就是泡桐与中国平原绿化。中国泡桐博得世界学者的青睐。
    中国大地上，泡桐事业在发展。80年代末泡桐又向西部高原进军。河南的桐根几千万株进入秦晋，耐旱品种在甘肃表现良好，泡桐以英勇的姿态向西北的严寒、干旱和荒漠挑战。全国22个省市自治区都可看到它的英姿。林业部规划在全国发展21亿株，10年一个轮伐期，每年就是6000万立方米木材。河南已占1／5，株数、面积、蓄积量、出口额均在全国首位。中国最大的桐木加工厂已在商丘筹建。
      “小小泡桐，发展成宏伟的绿色事业。小中有大。”蒋校长讲起了辩证法。“但对泡桐的探索和培育是无止境的。它的潜力还很大。”
    “我一生献给了泡桐。我的生命有限，泡桐的生命是无限的。”这位50年代就离开水明山秀的赣江之畔扎根中原大地的老知识分子，希望中又有新的忧虑，1989年农大招生670人，报第一志愿的仅87人，是历史上最少的一年。
      “民族的振兴，还要从农林开始。树木必先树人。若不树人，这绿色事业何以延续发展下去？”他留下长长的问号……
