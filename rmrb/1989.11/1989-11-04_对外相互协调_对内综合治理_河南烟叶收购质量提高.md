This year, Henan Province has strengthened coordination with neighboring provinces and implemented economic and legal measures to regulate and rectify the tobacco leaf procurement market. As a result, the procurement order has stabilized and improved, and the phenomenon of adulteration and counterfeiting has been basically eliminated. According to inspections, the quality of tobacco leaf procurement in Henan Province this year has returned to its historical highest level.

Henan Province is a major tobacco leaf production area, accounting for about one-quarter of the national total production. In addition to supplying local cigarette factories, it also provides raw materials for more than 100 cigarette factories in 27 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. During the "tobacco leaf wars" in 1987 and 1988, the provincial government and tobacco companies suffered greatly. To fundamentally reverse the chaotic situation in tobacco leaf procurement, the province first signed tobacco leaf procurement management agreements with neighboring provinces such as Anhui and Hubei, strengthening coordination with them. Internally, the provincial government organized public security, procuratorate, judicial, supervisory, industrial and commercial, tax, technical supervision, and tobacco monopoly departments to form work teams and dispatch them to tobacco-producing areas to coordinate and manage the procurement of tobacco leaves at the county level.

At the same time, various levels of government have taken economic and legal measures to comprehensively manage the tobacco leaf procurement market. The provincial tobacco monopoly bureau conducted a thorough inspection and rectification of county tobacco companies and tobacco leaf procurement stations, re-issued tobacco leaf procurement licenses to 1,450 procurement stations, and revoked or shut down 1,050 illegal procurement stations. They also severely cracked down on those who engaged in monopolistic practices.

    对外相互协调  对内综合治理
    河南烟叶收购质量提高
    本报郑州11月3日电　今年以来，河南省对外加强与邻省相互协调，对内采取经济、法律手段，治理整顿烟叶收购市场，使烟叶收购秩序稳定好转，掺杂使假现象基本杜绝。据检查，今年河南省烟叶收购质量已恢复历史最高水平。
    河南省是烟叶的主要集中产区，产量约占全国总产量的1／4，除供应本省卷烟厂家，还为27个省市区的100多家卷烟厂提供原料。在1987年和1988年的“烟叶大战”中，该省各级政府和烟草公司吃尽了苦头。为从根本上扭转烟叶收购的混乱局面，这个省首先与安徽、湖北等邻省签订了烟叶收购工作管理协议，加强了与邻省之间的协调。对内，省政府组织公、检、法、司、工商、税务、技术监督和烟草专卖等部门，抽调干部组成工作组派驻产烟区，组织协调地（市）县烟叶收购。
    与此同时，各级政府采取经济、法律等手段，对烟叶收购市场综合治理。省烟草专卖局对县烟草公司和烟叶收购站点进行清查整顿，给1450个收购站点重新审发了烟叶收购许可证，撤销、取缔了1050个违法经营的收购站点，并对欺行霸市的烟霸予以严厉打击。　（李杰　刘彩望）
