In the heart of Yunnan, the Panjiang River encircles a beautiful small town—Panxi in Huaning County. In recent years, Panxi's Orange Street has gained fame. Every morning, oranges and tangerines fill the stalls, baskets overflowing with golden fruits. The air is filled with the sweet scent of citrus. Merchants from all directions come early to select oranges, negotiate prices, and then follow the vendors to the orchards or load the oranges onto small trains. All of this seems like magic, but who had ever heard of Panxi's Orange Street before?

This fertile land near the northern edge of the tropics still has ancient wild orange trees on the river valleys and slopes. Before the founding of the People's Republic, people who traveled outside brought back some orange seedlings and planted them in their courtyards, where they bore abundant fruits. After that, during the cooperative movement and the "Great Leap Forward," large-scale orange orchards were established, but they were poorly managed and failed after just a few years. During the Cultural Revolution, more orange orchards were planted as "model mountains" and "flower-fruit mountains," but they were also mismanaged and destroyed.

The people of Panxi learned from these repeated setbacks that orange cultivation is a science. Ignoring objective laws and relying on large-scale plans and hasty efforts would only lead to failure. The development of agricultural economy fundamentally relies on the application of scientific and technological advancements. It's better to be slow and steady than to be chaotic. Only through science can we avoid blindly rushing into things. In 1980, a citrus experimental station was established here, and experts were invited to guide the planting of 4 acres of oranges. In 1982, the trees bore fruit, yielding 2,600 kilograms of oranges. By 1984, the 4 acres produced 21,000 kilograms of oranges, truly a golden harvest! The news spread, and farmers from all around came to see, eager to plant oranges themselves. The experimental station had already prepared orange seedlings, and the county, heeding experts' advice on preventing citrus viruses, ordered that seedlings must be supplied by the experimental station and that technical personnel must guide the planting. That year, Panxi saw the emergence of a thousand-acre orange orchard.

Cultivating oranges became a spontaneous desire among the farmers, and the citrus experimental station became a demonstration field for those hoping to achieve prosperity through orange cultivation. Director Guo Ruixiang trained a group of people who loved agricultural science and were dedicated to developing citrus in their hometown. Over the years, the experimental station introduced dozens of citrus varieties, expanding the orchard to 500 acres. In 1986, based on the experimental station, the Yuxi Region Citrus Research Institute was established. They adhered to the principle of production leading to research and research promoting production, cultivating a high-yield orange orchard by the southern bank of the Panjiang River. Except for construction, the institute's citrus production was entirely self-sustaining after its establishment. To promote orange cultivation among the farmers, they held annual citrus technology training classes, inviting farmers to receive training; they also established a 10-person citrus technology guidance team, dividing responsibilities by region to guide farmers in solving technical problems. They were specifically responsible for 5 points, providing free services at 2 points and investing land and technology at 3 points, with the research institute handling the investment and technical guidance, and sharing the profits, thus developing the research institute into a science-led enterprise.

With science as a guarantee, farmers gained confidence and planted oranges with enthusiasm. Now, Huaning has 12,000 acres of orange orchards. In October, walking into the Panjiang River valley, the green orange groves stretch endlessly, "trees shrouded in smoke like fire, mountains reflecting the sun like hanging gold." In just a few years, Huaning has become the largest citrus base in central Yunnan.

　　科技示范的神力

    滇中南盘江环绕着一个美丽的小镇——华宁县的盘溪。近两年，盘溪柑桔街声名鹊起。早晨，这边蜜桔，那边锦橙，满箩满箩金黄的桔子，一个摊位挨着一个摊位，晨雾的空气里飘逸出甜甜的桔香。南来北往的商贩，一早就在柑桔街上选桔子，定价钱，随后跟着摊主去桔园，或是拉着桔子去赶小火车。这一切，就像是一挥魔杖变出来的，以前谁听说过盘溪柑桔街？
    盘溪这块热带北缘沃野，河谷坡地上还孓存着古老的野生桔树。建国前，外出的人曾带回些桔树苗，栽种在庭园里，硕果累累。那以后，合作化、“大跃进”，都搞过成片柑桔园，只见栽种无人管，才几年就失败了。“文革”时又搞柑桔“样板山”、“花果山”，种了不少，管理得不好，也毁了。
    盘溪人从一次次挫折中领悟到：柑桔生产有学问，不顾客观规律，靠大指标，一哄而起，没有不失败的。农业经济要发展，根本的因素还在于发挥科学技术的作用。不怕慢、只怕乱，靠科学才能避免瞎折腾。1980年，这里建起柑桔试验场，请来专家指导种下4亩桔子。1982年挂果，收了2600公斤桔子。到了1984年，4亩地里产桔子2.1万公斤，真是树树悬金！消息传开，四乡农民纷纷跑来观看，看了就嚷着要栽桔子。试验场早育出了桔苗准备着，县里听取了专家关于防止柑桔病毒的意见，明令不得各自引进，要由试验场统一供苗，派出技术员指导栽种。这一年，盘溪冒出了千亩桔园。
    种柑桔成了农民的自觉要求，柑桔实验场成了希望种桔致富农民的示范田。场长郭瑞祥带出了一批热爱农业科学、有志于在家乡发展柑桔的人才。几年间，实验场引进柑桔几十种，桔园扩大到500亩。1986年，在实验场基础上建立了玉溪地区柑桔研究所。他们坚持生产出题目，科研促生产的方针，在南盘江边培育出一片高产桔园，除了基建外，建所后柑桔生产完全自负盈亏。为了推动四乡农民种桔，他们每年义务开办柑桔技术讲习班，请农民来接受培训；还建立了10个人的柑桔技术辅导组，分片负责，指导农民解决技术问题。他们具体负责5个点，其中2个点无偿服务，3个点由农民投土地，科研所负责投资和技术指导，收益分成，使研究所朝着科研先导型企业发展。
    科学作保证，农民心里有了底，放开手脚种桔子。现在，华宁已有1.2万亩桔园了。10月里走进南盘江河谷，碧绿的桔林一块连着一块，“树树笼烟疑带火，山山照日似悬金。”才几年工夫，华宁已是滇中最大的柑桔基地了。
