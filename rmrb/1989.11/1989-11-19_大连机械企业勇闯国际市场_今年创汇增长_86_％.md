In the process of opening up to the outside world, several mechanical industry enterprises in Dalian City have grown stronger and are actively exploring the international market. As of now, the export earnings have increased by 86% compared to the same period last year.

Since this year, Dalian's mechanical industry has faced unprecedented difficulties: the number of orders received has decreased by 30%, the shortage of raw materials is nearly 50%, the lack of working capital is nearly 40%, and there are also constraints in electricity and transportation. It was initially estimated that the economic benefits of the mechanical industry would decline by more than 20% this year. Faced with these challenges, the management department of Dalian's mechanical industry promptly proposed the strategy of seeking benefits from the international market. The production of more than ten old export products, such as motors, rubber and plastic machinery, bearings, and electromagnets, in Dalian, has also significantly increased this year, with export earnings growing exponentially.

To explore the international market, these enterprises have made extraordinary efforts. Dalian Crane Machinery Factory has defeated more than ten strong competitors from the United States, Japan, and the Federal Republic of Germany in international bidding, securing the bid and making China's heavy machinery enter the U.S. market for the first time, joining the ranks of the world's leading port container crane manufacturers. Currently, the factory has signed export and technology transfer contracts with manufacturers from six countries, including the United States and Japan, with export earnings reaching nearly $4 million, which is 2.5 times that of last year. Next year, it is expected to achieve $10 million in export earnings.

    大连机械企业勇闯国际市场
    今年创汇增长86％
    据新华社大连11月18日电 （记者李小林）在对外开放中壮大起来的大连市一批机械工业企业，积极开拓国际市场，截至目前，出口创汇额比去年同期增长86％。
    今年以来，大连市机械工业遇到了前所未有的困难：承接订货合同减少30％，原材料缺口近50％，流动资金缺少近40％，以及电力、运输等方面制约，年初预计全年机械工业经济效益将下降20％以上。在困境面前，大连市机械工业主管部门及时提出向国际市场要效益的对策。大连的电机、橡塑机、轴承、电磁等十几种老出口产品的生产厂，今年的出口量也都大幅度增加，出口创汇成倍增长。
    为了开拓国际市场，这些企业付出了超常的努力。大连起重机器厂战胜了美国、日本、联邦德国等国的十几家起重机制造强手，在国际投标中中标，使我国的重型机械首次进入美国市场，跃入世界港口集装箱起重机制造先进行列。目前，这个厂已与美国、日本等6个国家的厂商签订了出口和技术转让合同，出口创汇已近400万美元，是去年的2.5倍，明年可望实现千万美元。
