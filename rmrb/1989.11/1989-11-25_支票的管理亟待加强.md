The management of checks urgently needs to be strengthened. The lesson of 22 stolen checks

Wang Xiaoqing and Guo Xiaodong from the Propaganda Department of the Ningdu County Committee, Jiangxi Province, wrote: On August 3rd and 7th, our county experienced two incidents where a total of 22 blank cash checks were stolen. Upon examining the cases, the following patterns emerged: the checks were stolen from the office desks of the units involved, and the cashier only realized the theft the next day when using the checkbook as a fan.

The day before the incidents, the criminals had inquired about the methods for filling out and stamping the account name, purpose, and seal on the cash checks at the unit.

When stealing the unit's seal, the criminals mistakenly stamped another account's seal. However, the bank did not notice the discrepancy in the seal on the cash checks, allowing the criminals to successfully withdraw the cash.

These two cases reflect the chaotic management of cash checks in some units and the lax oversight by banking departments. It is understood that similar cases have occurred in other regions, causing disruptions to the normal operations of the stolen units and the economic order of society. We hope this will alert relevant departments to pay attention and be vigilant.

Impersonating a bank to commit fraud

Liu Xianxin from the Industrial and Commercial Administrative Bureau of Yiyang Region, Hunan Province, wrote: Recently, while reviewing cases of speculative illegal activities, we discovered that many of these cases involved the use of enterprise bank account names. The South County Industrial and Commercial Bureau handled 28 major cases from January to July this year, with a total amount involved of 9.87 million yuan. Seventeen of these cases, involving 6.38 million yuan, were committed using the names of state-owned commercial enterprises' bank accounts. The main tricks used by those who impersonate enterprise bank account names to engage in fraudulent buying and selling are as follows:

1. Pretending to be a bank official, participating in trade and procurement meetings.
2. Forging bank business seals, using bank business terminology to certify and issue letters, falsely representing the bank as an intermediary and guarantor.
3. Stealing the bank account number of a state-owned commercial enterprise, signing purchase contracts, and obtaining goods through fraud.
4. Using discarded blank bank vouchers, stamping forged bank business seals to commit fraud.
5. Exploiting the carelessness of bank handlers, using canceled bank deposit receipts to pick up goods from suppliers.

For example, a representative of the so-called "Hunan Provincial State-Owned South County Commercial (Group) Company" attended an electronic product supply meeting in Chengdu. He introduced himself as a bank official to the salesperson from the Wujiang County Electronic Fiber Material Factory in Jiangsu Province, leaving a good impression. On June 13th, this "company" representative used a forged "Business Special Seal of the South County Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China" to write "The unit has an account with our bank and has the ability to pay for goods" on a business letter, making the other party believe without doubt. As a result, 80,000 yuan worth of new-style radios and electronic products were shipped.

Properly filling out checks

Ma Suqi from the Retired Cadres Office of the People's Bank of China, Beijing Branch, wrote: Currently, checks used in circulation by various units often encounter issues such as loss or theft. Additionally, due to the negligence of the issuers, there are often overlooked problems: the issue date on the check is inaccurate, and sometimes the check is submitted to the bank before the issue date; the seal stamped on the check does not match the seal deposited with the bank by the issuer, causing the bank to waste time exchanging the bill and delaying the timely use of funds; the large and small amounts on the check do not match; the seal stamped on the check is blurred and cannot be verified. The text on the seal is missing strokes, and some seals, due to long-term use, have deformed characters, requiring a new seal to be made according to regulations for verification; according to the settlement methods of the People's Bank of China, the large amount on the check must be written in regular script or running script, but currently, the checks submitted to the bank show a mix of cursive, invented, and incorrect characters, sometimes making them unrecognizable. There are also issues with the improper writing of Arabic numerals, all of which cause unnecessary trouble for the issuer, payee, and the bank. Legal action may even be required. We hope that relevant personnel and financial workers will pay attention to these issues, fill out various vouchers correctly, and better utilize their functions.

(Note: Bank checks are vouchers issued by the depositors of a bank to the payee for settlement or to instruct the bank to pay the amount to the payee. Whether issued by units or individuals, checks are important documents for handling account transfers and cash payments. At the same time, checks are written evidence for recording accounts, economic activities, and clarifying economic responsibilities. The reader Ma Suqi's suggestion that checks must be filled out correctly is very reasonable.)

### 支票的管理亟待加强

　　支票的管理亟待加强
      22张支票被盗的教训
    江西宁都县委宣传部王小卿、郭晓冬来信：8月3日、7日，我县连续发生两起共22张空白现金支票被盗案件。纵观案情，有如下特点：支票是从被盗单位办公桌内窃出的，出纳员第二天将现金支票簿当扇子扇风时方才发觉。
    案发前一天，案犯曾到这个单位询问过现金支票上的户名、用途和印鉴等项目的填、盖方法。
    案犯在偷盖单位印鉴时，误盖另一帐户印鉴，但这印鉴不符的现金支票在银行竟未被觉察，案犯如愿领取了现款。
    这两起案件反映出部分单位现金支票管理混乱，银行部门把关不严的情况。据了解，此类案件在其它地区也有发生，给被盗单位的正常工作，社会的经济秩序造成了一定的混乱。希望引起有关部门的注意和警惕。
    冒充银行名义行骗
    湖南益阳地区工商行政管理局刘宪新来信：最近，我们在审批投机违法案件中，发现不少案件是盗用企业银行帐号名义所为的。南县工商局今年1至7月共处理大要案件计28起，案发金额987万余元，属上述情况作案的有17起，金额638万余元。盗用企业银行帐号名义从事骗买骗卖者的主要伎俩有五手：一是假称银行干部，参加交易订货会；二是仿制银行业务用章，用银行业务术语签证、发函，假冒银行中介和担保；三是盗用国营商业在银行的帐号，签订购货合同，骗取货物；四是盗用银行废旧空白凭证，加盖仿造的银行业务章行骗；五是利用银行经办人粗心大意，持银行作废的进帐回单，到供货单位自提货物。
    如所谓的“湖南省国营南县商业（集团）公司”代表，在成都电子产品供货会上，向江苏武进县电子光纤器材料厂供销员自称银行干部，使对方得到良好印象。6月13日，这个“公司”代表用仿刻的“中国工商银行南县支行业务专用章”，在业务公函上签批“该单位在我行开户，有承付货款能力”字样，致使对方确认无疑，运来价值8万多元的新式收录机和电子产品。
      正确填写支票
    中国人民银行北京分行老干部处马素琪来信：目前各单位在流通中使用的支票，除不时出现丢失、被盗等情况外，由于出票人本身不重视，也经常发现一些不容忽视的漏洞：支票的出票日期不准确，经常有人将收到的支票提交银行时，尚未到支票签发日期；支票加盖的印章与出票人预留银行的印鉴不符，造成银行白白浪费了票据的交换时间，也延误了资金的及时使用；支票上的大写金额与小写金额不一致；加盖支票上的印鉴模糊不清，无法核对。印章上的文字缺少点划，有的印章由于长期使用，字体变形，按规定必须更换新印鉴以便核对；按中国人民银行结算办法规定，支票大写金额一律要使用楷体或行书体书写，但目前交来银行的支票，从大写金额看，草字、杜撰字、错别字层出不穷，有时简直无法辨认。还有阿拉伯数字书写不规范等等，都给出票人、收款人及银行带来不应有的麻烦。甚至还需诉诸法律，希望各有关人员和财会工作者注意这些问题，填写好各种票证，更好地发挥其作用。
      （按：银行支票，是银行的存款人签发给收款人办理结算或委托开户银行将款项支付给收款人的票据。不论单位和个人填写的支票，都是作为办理转帐结算和现金收付的重要依据。同时，支票也是记载帐务、记载经济活动和明确经济责任的一种书面证明。读者马素琪提出支票一定要填写正确，这个意见是很有道理的。）
