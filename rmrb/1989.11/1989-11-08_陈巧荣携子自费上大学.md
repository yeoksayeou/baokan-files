Chen Qiaorong Takes Her Son to Study at University at Her Own Expense

Liu Jinying

For 20 years, she has been dreaming of going to university. Now, at the age of 37 and with a 3-year-old child, she has turned her dream into reality—she has become a self-funded student at Hebei Normal University. Recently, she went to Shijiazhuang with her child to register for classes.

Her name is Chen Qiaorong, a farmer from Xichaher Village, Doucun Township, Wuqiang County, Hebei Province. She has always loved reading and studied very hard. From primary school to junior high, she was always the top student in her class. In 1969, due to the wrong policies of the "Cultural Revolution," the commune middle school she attended was disbanded. Since then, she lost her chance to go to school and returned to the village to become a farmer with her shattered "dream of studying."

For 20 years, Qiaorong has yearned to study. To find opportunities to read, she postponed her marriage several times, finally marrying at the age of 25. Although her desire to study never faded, the tight living conditions brought by the "iron rice bowl" made it difficult for her to achieve her goal.

The spring breeze of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee brought hope to the countryside. Qiaorong was the first in the village to start commodity production, earning a living through instrument processing. In just a few years, she became a millionaire in the village, built a new house, and had all the modern conveniences—furniture, television, stereo, washing machine, camera, and more. To run her business, she traveled around half of China, visiting many famous scenic spots.

Who wouldn't envy such a prosperous life? But Chen Qiaorong had different thoughts in her heart. She always felt something was missing. Her husband asked her in bewilderment, "You have everything you need—food, drink, entertainment. What more do you want?" Qiaorong replied without hesitation, "I want to go to school!" The "university dream" she had harbored for many years became even stronger.

In 1985, Qiaorong went to Northeast China for business and saw an advertisement in the newspaper for self-study university in Changchun. She went to Changchun with a joyful heart to register.

The staff were surprised to see this middle-aged farmer and asked, "Are you registering?" "No, I'm registering for my younger sister," she lied, paying 50 yuan to buy a set of textbooks and studying them whenever she had time.

However, her cultural foundation was too weak, and sometimes she couldn't understand even after reading several times, often making her cry in frustration.

Last November, Qiaorong was selected as a women's representative from Wuqiang to attend the provincial women's congress, where she met a comrade working in the provincial women's federation. She confided her desire to study to this comrade. The comrade was moved by Qiaorong's spirit and helped her contact several schools. Finally, an agreement was reached with Hebei Normal University for her to study at her own expense.

Her long-cherished dream of studying was about to come true, and Qiaorong was so happy she almost danced with joy. But when she told her family, everyone shook their heads. Her husband said, "If you go to school, what about the child?" Villagers also expressed their bewilderment, saying, "You have no worries about food or drink, but you're obsessed with going to university. It's like you've lost your mind..." But Qiaorong was determined, saying, "I have money in hand, but my heart feels empty. No matter how much it costs, I will make up for this cultural gap. I am willing to endure any hardship."

She persuaded her family, went to the provincial capital twice, rented a room near the university, and arranged for her child to go to a daycare center.

On the morning of September 6, facing the dawn, Qiaorong boarded the long-distance bus to Shijiazhuang with confidence...

    她，已届中年，家财逾万，夫贤子娇，有个幸福的小家庭。然而她渴望的是——
    陈巧荣携子自费上大学
    刘金英
    20年了，她一直在做着“大学梦”。如今，已是37岁并有一个缠手的3岁孩子的母亲，居然把梦变成了现实——她成了河北师范学院的自费生，不久前已携带孩子到石家庄报到学习。
    她叫陈巧荣，河北省武强县豆村乡西岔河村的一位农民。她从小酷爱读书，学习非常刻苦，从小学到初中，一直是班上的学习尖子。1969年，由于“文化革命”的错误路线，她就学的公社中学瓦解了。从此，她失去了上学的机会，带着破碎的“读书梦”回村当了农民。
    20年来，巧荣梦寐以求的就是读书。为寻找读书机会，她把婚期一拖再拖，直到25岁才结了婚。她虽然读书之心不死，但“大锅饭”带来的紧巴日子，使她终难如愿。
    十一届三中全会的春风，给农村带来了希望。巧荣在村上率先搞起了商品生产，靠仪表加工，短短几年就成为村上的万元户，盖起了新房，家中组合家具、电视机、收录机、洗衣机、照相机……应有尽有。为跑业务，她还周游了大半个中国，饱览了不少名胜古迹。
    这样红火的小日子谁人不夸？谁人不羡？而陈巧荣却别有一番情思在心头，她总有一股不足之感。爱人不解地问她：“吃，喝，玩，样样不愁，你还想啥？”巧荣不假思索地回答：“想上学！”多年萦怀的“大学梦”此时越发强烈了。
    1985年，巧荣到东北跑业务，从报纸上看到自修大学长春分校招生的消息，她怀着喜悦的心情赶去长春报名。
    工作人员吃惊地看着这位30多岁的农妇，不解地问：“你报名？”“不，给我妹妹报。”她编了个谎话，掏50元钱买了一套教材，一有空子就认真地学起来。
    但是，她文化底子毕竟太薄了，有时看几遍也看不懂，常急得她“巴嗒巴嗒”掉眼泪。
    去年11月，巧荣被选为武强的妇女代表到省参加妇代会，结识了在省妇联工作的一位同志，向她倾吐了渴望读书的心声。那位同志被巧荣的精神所感动，先后为她联系了几所院校，最后与河北师范学院达成自费上大学的协议。
    多年的读书梦就要变成现实了，巧荣高兴地几乎手舞足蹈。但和家里人一说，一家人都摇头。爱人说：“你去上学，孩子怎么办？”村里人也大为不解地说：“不愁吃，不愁喝，鬼迷心窍上大学，简直是神经……”而巧荣却是铁了心，她说：“手头富了，心里总觉得空，说啥俺也要补上文化这一项，花多少钱俺也不心疼，受多少苦俺也心甘情愿。”
    她说服了家里人，两次赴省城，在师院附近租赁了一间房子，又给孩子联系好托儿所。
    9月6日凌晨，迎着霞光，巧荣满怀信心地登上了去石家庄的长途汽车……
