	1,400 Nanjing University Students Sign Up for Blood Donation

	Nanjing, Nov. 6 (Xinhua) — At 2:45 p.m. on Oct. 31, when the medical staff from the Nanjing Red Cross Blood Center gently removed the needle from Nie Honglang's arm, she, as the last student from Nanjing University to donate blood in the first batch, smiled calmly. The staff at the blood center told us, "It is rare to see over a thousand university students voluntarily donate blood in one go, with 552 people donating blood this time. This is quite rare nationwide." This event has been widely praised in Nanjing in recent days.

	As the first university in Nanjing to organize voluntary blood donation after the turmoil, the Party Committee and administrative departments of Nanjing University attach great importance to this event. The entire school's students responded enthusiastically, with 1,400 students volunteering to sign up. After medical examinations, 824 students were qualified, and the blood donation was completed on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1, exceeding the original plan by 224 people.

    南京1400名大学生报名献血
    本报讯　10月31日下午2时45分，当南京市红十字献血中心的医务人员从聂红崚的胳膊上轻轻抽出针头时，她作为首批最后一位南大献血同学，坦然地笑了。血站的同志告诉我们：“上千名大学生主动献血，一次采血552人，在全国也是少见的”。这件事最近几天在南京市传为佳话。
    作为动乱后在南京市第一个组织义务献血的高校，南京大学党委和行政部门对此非常重视。全校学生积极响应，有1400人自愿报名，824人体检合格，已于10月31日、11月1日两天完成采血，超过原计划224人。
