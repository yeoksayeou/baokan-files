The ninth day of the ninth month is the day Baiyangdian Lake opens. The people of the water town celebrate the opening of the lake on this day, perhaps in accordance with the folk saying, "Clear and Bright Festival's tail, Dragon Boat Festival's head, fishing and catching shrimp on the ninth day of the ninth month!"

Early in the morning, groups of people gather at the eastern embankment, eager to watch the fishing boats compete, the nets chase each other, the shrimp baskets on the docks like small mountains, the curved "arrow rotations" cleverly set up "confusion arrays," and the cormorants dive into the water to catch fish... The joyous and ecstatic expressions of the people seem to be reliving a long-lost dream.

After five years of drought, Baiyangdian Lake has regained its vitality with the return of water. How has the ebb and flow of the lake water affected the production and living patterns of the local people, especially in terms of their mindset? This is the theme of my visit and interview.

1

Six years ago, the once lush waters of Baiyangdian Lake dried up, revealing a desolate landscape of yellow gullies. The fishermen, however, navigated this barren expanse, seeking new lands...

During the dry years, Deng Heizi wandered anxiously between the water pools and reed fields. Gazing at the cracked lakebed, his eyes red with unshed tears—he was the Party secretary of Guolikou Village, and the eyes of over four thousand villagers were fixed on him, awaiting his decision!

Guolikou was originally a picturesque island village surrounded by water on all sides. During the Qing Dynasty, Emperor Qianlong loved to go fishing, and he built a palace and a fishing platform here, inscribing a plaque that read "Dongliang Yudai." During the Anti-Japanese War, this place was a key activity area for the Yanying Squad. The entire village of over a thousand households relied on fishing for a living, with each family owning one or two small boats, using them as their primary means of transportation. Men and women, young and old, were all excellent swimmers. Over the years, the village had trained and sent 86 provincial and national-level swimmers to the country. In the 1986 Asia-Pacific Swimming Championships, several gold and silver medalists came from Guolikou Village. The people lived by the water, men fished and women wove, and life was peaceful and abundant... In the mid-1980s, due to consecutive years of drought, upstream reservoirs gradually reduced water flow, and the downstream sluices lost control, releasing all their water, causing Baiyangdian Lake to gradually dry up.

Without water, where would the fish go?

The people of Baiyangdian, who had relied on fishing for generations, had to find a new path.

In the water town, dinner is served late. After the cooking smoke dissipates, the old committee room fills with the strong smell of tobacco. Several committee members gather again, discussing survival strategies.

Several nights of meetings yielded no good ideas, and everyone sat silently, smoking in frustration. The water town without water was like a soul lost, truly leaving people at a loss!

"Today, we must make a decision!" Deng Heizi stubbed out his cigarette on the brick floor and said loudly, "I think we should each write a character on our palms and reveal our plans."

When everyone showed their palms, Deng Heizi couldn't help but smile: everyone's plan revolved around "water."

Deputy Secretary Li Zenguo wrote "fishing." With the lakebed dry, they could use the remaining water to dig ponds and raise fish. This lifelong fisherman could cast a net like a flower, spot fish with a single glance, and know exactly what kind of fish it was—one net and it was guaranteed!

The public security committee member Zhao Youlu wrote "swimming." This descendant of the Yanying Squad, like his martyred father Zhao Nengxiang, was an excellent swimmer, able to dive a mile underwater. He thought they should leverage the village's swimming advantage, use the existing swimming pool facilities, and collaborate with the higher-level sports committee to establish a swimming training base.

The militia company commander Li Jinceng wrote "mud." This seemingly simple but highly perceptive young man, in addition to fishing, also knew how to do brick and tile work. With the lake dry, the silt was deep, so why not take advantage of the situation and start a brick and tile factory?

Deng Heizi wrote "sea." In the local dialect, "sea" seemed to mean "spreading ducks in all directions—vast and boundless."

"Everyone should open up a bit, not just circle around the village. We should go out, each showing our unique skills!" Deng Heizi expressed his long-held thoughts. He was good at integrating everyone's ideas, incorporating the committee members' suggestions into his own plan.

He said, "My opinion is both the same and different from yours; the same is that we all can't leave 'water,' but the different is that we should open up a bit, breaking away from Guolikou and going to Tianjin. Fishing is our specialty. Since Baiyangdian is dry, we can go to the Bohai Sea to fish, or to Xinjiang's Tianchi Lake, Inner Mongolia's Dalai Lake—anywhere with 'water'! Not just fishing, we can do other things too! The people of Guolikou are not inferior to others!"

After the committee members reached a consensus, they mobilized the entire village, even visiting each household to help them make decisions. However, changing one's homeland is not easy, especially for Chinese farmers who have a strong attachment to their native soil. It requires a painful psychological process.

Deng Heizi decided to lead by example. He understood the farmers' nature of "seeing is believing" and helped organize several groups to go out and find opportunities. First, he helped Deng Zhanguang, Deng Sibei, and a few others pool their resources to buy a large boat and dragnet, heading to Tianjin's Tanggu Port to catch sea fish and shrimp. In just a few months, each person earned over a thousand yuan. Later, he helped Deng Pen and Deng Zhengliang go to Inner Mongolia's Dalai Lake, where they fished while teaching the Mongolian people their fishing techniques. In a year, their income was also considerable.

Wang Jianmin and Zhang Guosheng's group ventured into Cangzhou, Baoding, and Beijing, where they established flour mills. Initially, there were not enough hands, so they brought their families along. These Baiyangdian fishermen were straightforward and hardworking, and by the end of the year, the economic benefits were naturally good.

Despite the frequent news of wealth from those who went out, some villagers remained hesitant, including the young men who should have been more adventurous. Zhang Gangzi was one of them.

Zhang Gangzi was in his prime, but he was very mature and cautious. He first dug ponds to raise fish and then raised ducks. Steady and reliable, his income was not bad. With a bit of money, he wanted to improve his living conditions, but the family's small environment was constrained by the village's large environment. Wanting to use running water, the village had none, and one person couldn't "flow" on their own; thus, he thought of the phrase "common prosperity" and decided to contribute to the village. However, his small efforts were not enough to make a big impact. He wanted to go out and do something big but was not very willing to move.

After the Mid-Autumn Festival, one evening, a neighbor's aunt asked him to help read a letter. The letter was from her son in Dalai Lake and was very long and touching. It first talked about his longing for his hometown while being away: on the Mid-Autumn night, looking at the two full moons in the sky and on the water, made him especially miss his family and hometown. Lying on a small boat, drifting aimlessly, the sweet memories soaked in the moonlight gently covered Dalai Lake, making him feel as if he were on Baiyangdian Lake. At this point, he said he cried, saying he wished he could abandon everything and fly back to his hometown, but he thought of the ancient saying, "A man of virtue has the world as his home!" and his heart gradually calmed down...

When he read this sentence, Zhang Gangzi felt a stab in his heart, and his eyes welled up with tears. Returning home, he took out all his savings and deposits and told his wife, "I'm leaving the household matters here. Tomorrow, I'll go out to find work!"

His wise wife was momentarily confused but knew her husband had thought it through, so she didn't ask any more questions.

Zhang Gangzi dove headfirst into the duck-raising town of Dazhangzhuang on the outskirts of the city, using the abundant down resources there to establish a down factory. The factory grew from small to large, becoming more and more prosperous, with accumulated funds reaching one million. Following his lead, villagers began to emulate him, and now Dazhangzhuang has become the down town, with over 50 down factories. Zhang Gangzi, despite his wealth, remained true to his original intentions, actively contributing funds and efforts, and under Deng Heizi's leadership, working with his fellow villagers to build water towers, install running water for every household, and is now actively raising funds to repair the village's roads...

Last August, the water from the Shijia River rushed into Baiyangdian Lake first, followed by the waters of the Cao, Fu, Tang, Long, and Bai Rivers. In an instant, Baiyangdian Lake was full of water again. The wandering children returned, following the water.

In just a few days, over a thousand young people who had gone out to make a living returned to the water town. The cars and tractors they had sold their boats for a few years ago were now useless again, the fish ponds were flooded, and the reeds were soaked. Even with water, there were no fish in the lake yet, and the people of Baiyangdian faced new choices.

"The third son of the old Yanying Squad member Zhao Bo bought a boat and started a tourism business!" This news spread throughout the village in an instant.

Zhao Bo's third son, Zhao Kexin, was 23 years old, tall and broad-shouldered, very much like his heroic father. He was just a bit more educated and quicker-witted. When Baiyangdian Lake suddenly filled with water, there were no fish to catch, and the reeds had not grown yet. But the clear lake water was very attractive to tourists from Tianjin, Beijing, and Tangshan. He understood: anyone with a bit of historical and geographical knowledge knew that Baiyangdian Lake was the largest freshwater lake in the north, with a long history and beautiful scenery. The Northern Wei Dynasty's "Water Classic" recorded: "From here to the south of the water, the south reaches Hutu, the west reaches Quanzhou Yongnu, the east reaches the sea, called Yongnu Marsh. Its marshes are vast, with ninety-nine lakes, branching and connecting, often communicating." This "branching" and "connecting" provided great convenience for the Yanying Squad to fight the enemy and burn ships during the war. The stories of the Yanying Squad added a layer of legend to the picturesque Baiyangdian Lake. Tourists entering the lake needed to take a boat, and once inside, they needed to eat, drink, play, and buy souvenirs... Why not get a flatboat and start a water tourism restaurant? Tourists could dine here, fish, drink tea, play chess, and enjoy the scenery of "the setting sun and the lone wild geese flying together, the autumn water merging with the long sky." Wouldn't that be good?

Young people are bold and daring, saying and doing things at the same time. Indeed, he started a water restaurant at the tourist spot near Yuying Island, naming it "Yanying Restaurant." At first, business was good, and passing tourists were willing to stop for a meal, drink tea, and enjoy the lake scenery. As various tourist facilities increased at Yuying Island, competitors also increased. Zhao Kexin thought hard and came up with another idea: why not bring out his old father to boost business, just needing him to sit on the flatboat, and tourists would come in droves.

Zhao Kexin shared his idea with his father, but Zhao Bo was silent for a long time. This once-famous scout in the Yanying Squad, who played a leading role in the disguise raid on the tax collection building and the ambush of enemy ships with a leaf on his head, later joined the regular army and, due to illness, returned to his hometown to become an ordinary citizen. However, his name was known far and wide, and every three or five days, someone would invite him to give a speech or talk about traditions, which he enjoyed doing as a volunteer propagandist. This time, his son wanted him to come out and use the old Yanying Squad member card to boost business and attract customers.

"You little rascal, you're really good at coming up with ideas, wanting me to be a live advertisement for you! No way!" Zhao Bo saw through his son's intentions and flatly refused.

Zhao Kexin was anxious and quickly said, "Dad, you often give free speeches and lectures for others. If you sit on my boat for a while, the money earned will also be yours!"

When he mentioned "money," Zhao Bo got angry: "You little rascal, you want to use my Yanying Squad member card to make money, I won't do it! I don't want to make this money either. Tell you, I've held a gun for half my life, and when I die, I just want to be cremated in my old military uniform... I've held a gun for half my life, and when I die, I still long for the team..."

During this visit to the lake, I met with both father and son separately.

Zhao Kexin's water restaurant was indeed unique. From the outside, it was ornate and had the grandeur of a stone boat from the Summer Palace. When he talked about asking his father to come out, he shook his head and laughed, "The old man is a bit old-fashioned, not very open-minded!" After saying that, he busily offered me a cigarette and tea, smiling and lively, very shrewd.

In the afternoon, I met Zhao Bo, who still lived in a very ordinary small courtyard in the water village. The courtyard gate was piled with freshly pulled chicken corn; entering the house, he had just finished his meal and, seeing that I was from the military, quickly brought out fresh lotus seeds to entertain me, appearing warm and enthusiastic. He was once a national militia hero, and I had seen him at the model meeting. Now, nearing seventy, his eyebrows and eyes still showed the same vigor as before. In our conversation, I found that his thinking was very agile and broad, not like his son said, "old-fashioned." When discussing party style and public sentiment, his words were very insightful, not at all like someone living in a secluded village.

I tentatively asked him how he knew so much about the world while living in the village. He smiled and pointed to the small radio with earphones on the kang bed, saying, "I listen to the radio every day!"

When talking about the rise and fall of Baiyangdian Lake, he was even more excited: "Water is good, water is good!" and eagerly stood up, wanting to take us to see the reed marshes where they once fought the enemy and ambushed supply ships.

From this old Yanying Squad member and his descendant, I seemed to see a certain separation brought by the changing times, perhaps what is now called a "generation gap"! But their words and deeds reflected the precious spirit of the Baiyangdian people, who follow the times, are not defeated by fate, and are tenacious and resilient, which can also be said to be the essence of our nation.

After Baiyangdian Lake received water, tourism flourished, and a man named Yang Fuhuo saw an opportunity to open up a new world in Baiyangdian Lake.

As tourists increased, they needed to eat and drink. Yang Fuhuo invested 15,000 yuan to lease and cultivate a large piece of land, starting his "vegetable basket project" and red bean deep processing project.

The "vegetable basket project" solved the problem of vegetables for tourists, and the red bean deep processing was aimed at the needs of Beijing. Beijing people love to eat red bean ice cream; thus, Yang Fuhuo's red beans filled the Beijing market for red bean ice cream.

At the same time, he also invested in building a large cold storage facility on the edge of Baiyangdian Lake. This was to take advantage of the fact that after Baiyangdian Lake stored water, the fishery would definitely flourish, and when fish became abundant, they naturally needed to be stored and preserved, and the cold storage facility would come in handy.

When I went to interview Yang Fuhuo, he was covered in dust, directing the installation of machinery in the food processing plant. After I explained my purpose, he took me on a tour and introduced the place.

The factory building was all designed and supervised by him. He had worked in a construction team for many years and was proficient in drawing plans and brick, tile, and woodwork. Therefore, the factory building was built quickly and economically according to his "one-stop" concept. After the machinery was installed, it could process feed, produce food, and even return straw to the field, all automated. He enthusiastically told me: in rural areas, you have to do things in a "one-stop" manner; the corn and wheat grown in the fields can be directly processed into food, cakes, and enter the commodity circulation market; the grain and vegetables produced can also solve the food and vegetable problems for factory workers. Bran and coarse grains can be fed to pigs and cows, and pig and cow manure can fertilize the fields. This year, the reeds on the edge of the lake are very lush, providing conditions for raising sheep. "Look, those sheep are so fat and strong!" He pointed to a flock of sheep in the reed field by the lake and showed me.

In conversations with the workers in the factory, I found that Old Yang had a good reputation, but there were also those who spoke ill of him, saying he was too stingy, especially with himself, with millions in his pocket but not spending a cent! He always wore rough clothes and looked no different from ordinary farmers; all day long, he was in the fields and factory, and when hungry, he would eat a corn cob or a sweet potato. When thirsty, he would drink directly from the water tap, not touching the drinks on the table.

A female employee from Northeast China in the office, however, said Old Yang was "generous" and kind-hearted. When villagers had difficulties, as long as they said a word, he would help wholeheartedly, giving thousands of yuan at a time! Yesterday, a widow passing by met him, and her son quickly knelt down to kowtow to him. Old Yang guessed she had encountered difficulties and immediately took out several hundred yuan!

From Yang Fuhuo, I saw another type of Baiyangdian farmer. They were tenacious, sincere, unwilling to sink, and with a Puritan-like faith, they swam forward in the great tide of economic reform, even if one day they were swallowed by the waves, they would not hesitate! This, perhaps, is a portrait of a new generation of Chinese farmers.

He came from the flowering reeds and walked into the golden dream he wove with reeds.

His name is Che Le Sheng, and his reed dream began in the year the lake dried up, continuing for six years. Now, the fluttering reed flowers have once again brought him into the depths of artistic creation.

I met him by chance. The chance encounter was at the edge of the large white reed field in Nili Village. At that time, my speedboat almost capsized his small eagle boat. I saw him dressed in a suit and tie, carefully cutting reed flowers, which was quite strange; such a large Baiyangdian Lake had reeds everywhere, why did he have to go deep into the lake to "pick flowers"?

"Making reed crafts requires these high-quality reed flowers!" He smiled and handed me a business card, which read: Baiyangdian Reed Craft Art Factory Director Che Le Sheng.

It was not appropriate to discuss deeply on our first encounter. That night, while admiring his exquisite and unique reed crafts, I discovered he was also an eccentric person from Baiyangdian.

In the early 1970s, the villagers of Guolikou sent him off to the army with drums and gongs, and he stayed in Xinjiang's Bayin Valley for five years. After demobilization, he returned home and resumed his water life.

The young man, having seen the world, naturally did not want to be idle. When Party Secretary Deng Heizi mobilized everyone to "show their unique skills," he, who had loved drawing since childhood and had some artistic foundation, began to secretly tinker with reed crafts at home—Baiyangdian had countless reeds, and the scenery of Baiyangdian was ever-changing. I want to use the reeds of Baiyangdian to create crafts that showcase the scenery of Baiyangdian. Che Le Sheng thus started from scratch, beginning his experiments.

After several breakthroughs and apprenticeships, he finally made a batch of very exquisite reed crafts. After applying for a national patent, he sold his old house, recruited soldiers, and officially established the Baiyangdian Reed Craft Art Factory.

In 1986, the foreign trade department notified him to take samples to Tianjin to participate in the trade fair. After going, however, he did not achieve instant fame, and there were very few inquiries.

Che Le Sheng returned and carefully pondered the reasons, discovering that he had made a mistake of "adding a tail to a snake"—after dyeing the reed leaves, he lost the original style of the reeds. He immediately restored the original color of the reed leaves, further improved the craft, developing from making simple patterns to cutting and pasting birds and animals, plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and pines, and even to the style of Qi Baishi's "big shrimp" and Xu Beihong's "galloping horse." On this basis, he used reed leaves to paste pictures of local scenery.

A Beijing craft and art company heard the news and discussed with him the matter of jointly producing reed crafts for export and earning foreign exchange, proposing a 50-50 split, using the Beijing Craft and Art Company's name. Che Le Sheng heard this and thought, "This is 'big fish eating small fish'!" "I won't do it!" He politely declined.

Che Le Sheng decided to improve the "quality" of reed crafts, relying on his own strength to open up the market, especially taking advantage of the favorable conditions of Baiyangdian receiving water and the sudden increase in domestic and foreign tourists, pushing the new reed crafts to the world.

In April this year, the general manager of Hong Kong Dadi Development Company, Mr. Zhu, saw the unique reed crafts and praised them highly, immediately signing a contract with Che Le Sheng for an order of 3.5 million yuan.

A few days later, a Japanese businessman heard the news and came, looking at Che Le Sheng's reed crafts and showing great interest, discussing export business with him, and signing a two-year export contract.

Che Le Sheng succeeded. This son of Baiyangdian, after years of hard struggle, finally realized his life's value and gained social recognition.

During the interview, I found that he did not consider this as fate's favor but believed it was related to the deep cultural structure of Baiyangdian people, related to the comprehensive factors of material and spiritual civilization in the water town.

I remember when I saw the village Party secretary, Deng Heizi, in the center of Baiyangdian, in Guolikou Village, I found that he was not black, wearing a gray suit and a large pompadour, very much like a city dweller.

In my impression, as a grassroots Party worker in a rural area, it was rare to see someone like him who was so diligent, responsible, and selfless. He could both adapt to the trend of reform and opening up and "grasp two civilizations," making Guolikou Village one of the two advanced civilized villages in Baoding Region in the provincial competition.

That day, when it was time to eat, he led me to a water hut in the center of the lotus pond, not far from the village, saying, "I should have treated you, and the money is also available. But the central government has repeatedly ordered not to entertain guests, and we can't just let it be. Let's go to our village's fishing point and have a meal of fresh fish!" His words were sincere and straightforward, reasonable and touching, making me, a slippery-tongued reporter, also deeply moved.

That night, I stayed in this "water pavilion," sleeping with the fishermen. In the middle of the night, the water was cold, and the gentle breeze from the lotus brought the singing of the women weaving mats in the fishing village. Unfortunately, it was past the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the moon did not rise, otherwise, I could have seen the scene described by Sun Li in "The Lotus Pond," where "the soft and smooth reed strips jump in the women's arms..."

### 水之恋——白洋淀掠影

　　水之恋
　　——白洋淀掠影
    曾凡华
    九月九，是白洋淀开淀的日子。水乡人把开湖节定在这一天，大概是应“清明尾，端阳头，捕鱼捞虾赶重九”的乡谚吧！
    一大早，三三两两的人群便拥向东堤，争看渔舟竞发、罾网相逐；看码头小山也似的虾篓船如何下篓，看弯弯曲曲的“箔旋”如何巧布“迷魂阵”，看久违了的鸬鹚如何下水逮鱼……欢欢喜喜的人们那如醉如痴的情状，似乎在重温逝去已久的梦。
    干涸了五年的白洋淀又重新注入了水的活力。淀水的枯荣给淀区人民的生产、生活方式带来何种影响，特别在观念心态上引起何种嬗变，这就是我此行采访的主题所在。
    1
    六年前，绿水泱泱的白洋淀干得见了底，沦为一片沟壑纵横的枯黄，渔民们却沿着这枯黄的沟横走向了新大陆……
    干淀那些日子，邓黑子惶惶然终日徘徊于水洼苇田之间。望着龟裂的淀底，他双瞳通红欲哭无泪——他是郭里口村党支部书记，全村四千多双眼睛在干巴巴地望着他，等他拿主意呀！
    郭里口原是个四面环水、风景幽美的自然岛村。清乾隆帝爱打水围，在此修了行宫，筑了钓鱼台，并御笔题书“溪光玉带”的匾额。抗日战争时期，这儿是雁翎队主要活动地点之一。全村一千多户人家均以治鱼为业，每户都有一两只小船，平时出门皆以船代步。村里男男女女、大大小小皆善泳，几年来为国家培养、输送了86名省级、国家级的游泳运动员；1986年亚太地区游泳比赛，夺得金牌、银牌者就有好几个出自郭里口村。人们靠水吃水，男渔女编，日子倒也过得怡和、丰实……80年代中期，由于连年干旱，上游水库步步节流，下游的闸门失去管制，倾其所有，使得白洋淀日臻枯竭。
    水之不存，鱼将焉附？
    祖祖辈辈以治鱼为业的白洋淀人向何处去？
    水乡的夜饭吃得迟，待炊烟散尽，老队部的屋里又弥满了浓烈的旱烟味。几个支委再度聚在一起，合计求生之路。
    连续几个晚上的会，大家伙想不出什么好办法，都埋头抽闷烟。水乡断了水便像丢了魂，真让人有点一愁莫展了！
      “今儿个说啥也得拿准主意了！”邓黑子把烟蒂往砖地上死命一摁，朗声说：“我看这样吧，大家伙都在自己手心上写个字，亮亮计。”
    待大家伸出巴掌看时，邓黑子不由得笑了：每人亮出的计谋都离不开“水”。
    副书记李增国写的是“渔”，淀底干了，可以利用残留的水泡子挖水塘养鱼。这位世代以渔为业的捕鱼好手，能把一张网撒成一朵花，哪儿有鱼，他一眼就能看出来，说是什么鱼，一网下去——准是！
    治保委员赵友禄写的是“泳”字。这位老雁翎队员的后代，和他牺牲的父亲赵能祥一样，水性极好，一个猛子能扎出一里地。他觉得要发挥游泳之乡的优势，利用已有的游泳池等设施，和上级体委联系，办一个游泳训练基地。
    民兵连长李金城写的是“泥”字。这位外貌憨憨实实，却极有灵性的年轻人，除治鱼之外还会干泥瓦活，淀里一干，淤泥很深，何不因势利导办个砖瓦厂。
    邓黑子写的却是“海”字。按乡里的土话来解释这个“海”字，似有“四面八方撒鸭子——广大没边”的意思。
      “大家伙还是要开放一些，别再死围着这村子团团转了。要走出去，来个八仙过海，各显神通！”邓黑子说出了这些天来闷在肚子里的话。他善于博采众长，把几位支委的主意都“海”进了自己的想法里了。
    他说：“我的意见和大家伙又同又不同；同的是都离不开‘水’，不同的是要开放一点，脱开了郭里口‘海’到天津卫那边去了！治鱼是我们本行，白洋淀干了，我们可去渤海湾打渔，可以去新疆天池、内蒙的达赉湖，全国凡是有
  ‘水’的地方都可以去！不仅仅打鱼，别的也可以干！我们郭里口人不比别处的人笨！”
    支委会统一了认识之后，便向全体村民进行了动员，还分头到各家各户帮大家拿主意。可江山易改，热土难离，特别对乡土观念极重的中国农民来说，要离乡背井、远走他方，须要经过一个痛苦的心理历程。
    邓黑子决定以点带面。他十分了解农民“眼见为实”的秉性，帮助组织了几个小组外出谋活路。先是帮邓占国、邓四辈几个人集资买了大船、拖网，开到天津塘沽海口打海鱼，网对虾，没出几个月，每个人都挣了个千二八百的。后来又帮邓盆、邓正亮等人去了内蒙达赉湖，一边打鱼，一边带徒弟，把他们娴熟的治鱼技术传给蒙
  古族人民，一年下来，收入也颇可观。
    王建民、张国胜一帮人打进了沧州、保定和北京，在那里办起了面粉厂。开始人手不够，又把一家人带了去。这些白洋淀渔民性子直，又舍得吃苦，年底结算，经济效益自然不会差。
    尽管外出的人频频传回致富的信息，村里还是有些人按兵不动，包括那些年纪轻轻，本该有几分闯劲的后生们。臧钢子就是一个。
    臧钢子正值血气方刚的年纪，遇事却十分稳重老成，他先是挖塘养鱼，后又养旱鸭子，稳扎稳打，自个的收入也不算少。有了点钱，总想在生活方式上来点改良，可家庭小环境又受制于村里的大环境。想用自来水，村里没有，一个人也
  “自流”不起来；于是，他想到了“共同富裕”这几个字，决心为村里做点贡献。可自己小打小闹很难干出大名堂。有心想出去大干一番却又不太愿意动窝。
    中秋过后的一个傍晚，邻居家大婶请他帮忙读家信。信是她儿子从达赉湖寄来的。写得很长很动人，先是讲到他作为游子在遥远的异乡对故土的怀恋之情：中秋之夜，望着天上水上的两轮满月，使人格外思恋亲人思恋家乡。躺在小船上任其飘荡，那浸渍甜蜜回忆的月光轻笼着达赉湖，让人感觉着是置身在白洋淀上。写到这当儿，他说他哭子，说他恨不得抛却一切，插翅飞回故乡，可他一想起古人说过的那句话：“好男儿四海为家！”心内便又逐渐平复下来……
    念到这句话，臧钢子觉得心口上被什么东西刺了一下，眼窝子里发涩发潮。回到家，他翻出了所有的积蓄和存款，对爱人说：“家里这一摊子事我撂下了，明儿个出淀子去谋活计！”
    贤惠的妻子一时莫名其妙，知道丈夫已深思熟虑，也不再多问。
    臧钢子一头扎到城郊的养鸭之乡大张庄，利用这里丰富的羽绒资源办了个羽绒厂。厂子由小到大，越办越红火，资金积累已达百万。在他的带动下，村里人纷纷起而仿效，如今大张庄已成为羽绒之乡，大小羽绒厂已有50多个，臧钢子致富不改初衷，积极出资出力，在邓黑子带领下，和乡亲们一道，在村里建起了水塔，给家家户户安通了自来水，眼下正积极筹资为整修村里的道路作准备……
    2
    去年8月，拒马河水一马当先涌入白洋淀，漕、府、唐、潴龙、白沟诸河的水也相继涌来，白洋淀刹那间又绿水满盈了。流落外乡的游子们也追着水头纷纷归来。
    短短十几天工夫，便有一千多在外乡谋生的青年人回到了水乡，几年前变卖了船只换来的汽车、拖拉机如今又用不上了，鱼塘淹了，苇子泡汤了。即使有了水，淀里一时还不会有鱼，白洋淀人又面临着新抉择。
      “老雁翎队员赵波家的三小子买船办旅游了！”这个信息一下子就传遍了全村。
    赵家小三叫赵克新，年方二十三，长得方头大耳，极像他英雄的父亲。只是比父亲多读了点书，脑子也转得快。白洋淀乍一满水，鱼打不成，苇子也没长上来。可一汪淀水碧澄透亮，对津、京、唐一带的旅游者颇具吸引力。他明白：稍有点历史地理知识的人都知道白洋淀是北方最大的淡水湖，历史悠久，风光宜人，北魏郦道元的《水经注》上就有记载：“自是水之南。南极滹沱，西至泉州雍奴，东极于海，谓之雍奴薮。其泽野，有九十九淀，枝流条分，往往迳通。”这“条分”、“迳通”，给当年的雁翎队打鬼子、烧汽船以极大的便利。而雁翎队的故事又给风光旖旎的白洋淀增添了一层传奇色彩。游人们进淀要坐船，进了淀之后要吃、要喝、要玩、要买纪念品……何不弄一艘平台船，开个水上旅游饭店，游者既可在此用餐，也可在此垂钓，还可以品茗下棋，欣赏“落霞与孤鹜齐飞，秋水共长天一色”的淀里风光，岂不好么？
    年轻人胆火足，说干就干，果然在旅游点鸳鸯岛旁边办了个水上饭店，取其名曰“雁翎餐厅”，一开始，生意颇好，过往的游客都愿意在这儿驻足小憩，吃上一顿饭，喝上一碗茶，领略一番湖光秀色。随着鸳鸯岛各种旅游设备的增多，竞争者也多了起来。赵克新冥思苦想，又生一计：何不把老父亲拉出来撑撑门面，只须他在平台船上一坐，游人们都会慕名而来。
    赵克新把主意对老父亲一说，赵波半天没有言语。这位当年雁翎队里赫赫有名的侦察员，在化妆奇袭税收楼，头顶荷叶伏击鬼子汽船等战斗中都是唱的主角，后来去了正规部队，因病转业回乡后，当了名普通的老百姓。然而名声在外，隔三插五总有人请他去作报告，讲传统，他都乐此不疲，甘愿当一名义务宣传员。这回儿子要请他出山，是想打老雁翎队员这张牌，给餐厅撑门面、拉生意。
      “你小子真会出花花点子，想让老子给你当活广告呀！没门！”赵波看出了儿子的用意，一口回绝了。
    赵克新急了，赶忙说：“爸，您老人家平时不也常常给别人义务讲演作报告吗？在我那船上坐一坐，挣得的钱，也有您老一份呀！”
    一提起“钱”，赵波便动了气：“好小子，你想拿我这张雁翎队员的牌子为你挣钱，我不干！我也不想挣这份钱，告诉你，我死了给我弄套旧军服穿上火化了就成，我拿了半辈子枪，死了还恋着队伍上……”
      这次进淀，我分头见了这父子俩。
    赵克新的水上餐厅的确办得很有特色。从外观上看，雕栏画栋的很有点颐和园石画舫的气派。说起他请父亲出山那档子事，他笑着直摇头：“老头子脑子有点守旧，思想不大开放！”说完了就忙着给我递烟，请我喝茶，笑模笑样的，很有点买卖人的机灵劲。
    下午见了赵波，他仍住在水村一个极普通的小院里。院门口堆了刚刚拔出的鸡头米；进了屋，他刚用过饭，见我是部队上的人，忙端出新采的菱角招待我，显得亲切而热情。他曾是全国民兵英雄，我在英模会上见过他，如今已年近七十，但眉宇之间的豪迈之气仍不减当年。言谈之间，我发现他思维极敏捷，极开阔，不像他儿子所说的那般
  “守旧”，论及党风民情，他的话也极有见地，根本不像是深居岛村的“桃花园中人”。
    我试探着问他，为何身居岛村却全知天下大事。他笑着指指炕头那配了耳机的小型收音机说：“我天天听广播呢！”
    说到白洋淀荣枯之事，他更是眉飞色舞：“来了水就好，来了水就好！”并欣然起身，要带我们去看当年他们雁翎队打鬼子包运船的芦苇荡。
    我从这老雁翎队员和他的后代身上，似乎看出了时代变迁所带来的某种剥离，也许就是时兴所称的“代沟”吧！但他们的所言所为，却体现了白洋淀人那种紧跟时代，不被命运所折服，坚韧不拔昂奋向上的可贵精神，这也可以说正是我们民族的精华所在。

    白洋淀来水之后，旅游兴旺起来，有个叫杨富和的人瞅准时机，又在白洋淀开辟一片新天地。
    旅游者多了要吃要喝，杨富和投资1.5万，承包租种了一大片土地，开始搞他的“菜篮子工程”和红小豆深加工项目。
    “菜篮子工程”解决了旅游者的吃菜问题，红小豆深加工却是针对北京的所需。北京人爱吃红小豆冰棍；于是，杨富和生产的红小豆充实了北京市的红小豆冰棍市场。
    与此同时，他还在白洋淀边投资建一个大冷库，这是瞅准了白洋淀蓄水之后，渔业必定兴盛，鱼一多，自然须存放保鲜，冷库便派上了大用场。
    我去采访杨富和时，他正一身尘土地在指挥副食品联合加工厂的机器安装。听我说明来意，便带着我边参观，边介绍。
    厂房全是他亲自设计，监督施工的。他在建筑队干过多年，图纸设计，泥、瓦、木工全都会。因此，厂房按他的“一条龙”构想又快又省地建了起来。待机器安装完毕，既可搞饲料加工，又可搞副食品生产，还能搞“秸秆还田”，一式的自动化。他兴致勃勃地告诉我：在农村办事情，就是要搞成“一条龙”；田里种出的玉米、麦子可以直接加工成副食品，糕点，进入商品流通市场；生产的粮食、蔬菜也可以解决工厂职工的口粮和吃菜问题。麸皮、杂粮可以喂猪养牛，猪、牛粪又可肥田。今年淀边的苇草茂盛得很，给养羊提供了条件。“您瞧，那群羊吃得好肥好壮！”他指着淀边苇草地里的一群绵羊让我看。
    在厂里与职工的交谈中，我发现老杨的口碑颇好，也有说他坏话的，说他太抠，特别是对自己太抠，腰缠万贯，却不轻易花一个子！平时总是粗衣布履，与一般农民无二；一天到晚就在田间、厂房转，饿了就啃个玉米棒子或吃个地瓜。渴了便就着水龙头喝自来水，摆着的饮料也不喝。
    办公室一位东北籍女雇员却说老杨“大方”，乐善好施。乡里乡亲有什么难处，只要说一声，他必鼎力相助，一甩就是千二八百的。昨天，一位过路的寡妇碰见了他，忙叫儿子给他磕头，老杨料到她遇到难处，一伸手便抽出好些张大团结！
    从杨富和身上，我看到了白洋淀农民的又一种类型。他们坚韧、诚挚，不甘沉沦，抱着清教徒般的信念，一往无前地在经济改革的大潮里潜泳，即使有一天被大浪所吞没，他们也在所不惜！这，或许是中国一代新农民的写照。

    他从扬花的芦苇中走来，又走进了自己用芦苇编织起来的金色的梦境。
    他叫车乐生，芦苇梦从干淀的那一年做起，一直做了六年。此刻，纷纭如小雪的芦花又再度把他带入到艺术创造的堂奥。
    我和他算是巧遇。巧遇在泥李庄那片大白皮苇田边。当时我乘的冲锋舟差点荡翻了他的小鹰排。我见他西装革履、小心翼翼地在剪苇子花，好生奇怪；偌大个白洋淀哪儿没有芦苇花，干吗非要钻到这大淀深处来“采花”呢？
      “搞芦苇工艺要用这上好的芦花才行！”他莞尔一笑，递给我一张名片，上书：白洋淀工艺美术制品厂厂长车乐生。
    初次邂逅，不便深谈。当晚在参观他那精妙绝伦、别具风味的芦苇工艺品时，才发现他也是白洋淀一位奇人。
    70年代初，郭里口的乡亲们敲锣打鼓用船把他送去当兵，在新疆巴音沟一呆就是五年。复员回乡，又操他的水上生涯。
    年轻人在外头见了世面，自然不甘寂寞。当党支书邓黑子动员“各显其能”时，他从小喜爱画画，有点美术功底，便在家里暗暗捣鼓他的芦苇工艺——白洋淀的苇子成千上万，白洋淀的风光千变万化，我要用白洋淀的苇子制作出表现白洋淀风情的工艺品来。车乐生就这样白手起家，开始了他的试验。
    几经攻关，几经拜师学艺，他终于试制出一批十分精美的芦苇工艺品。向国家申报了专利之后，便把老家的房子卖了，招兵买马，正式建立起白洋淀芦苇工艺美术厂。
    1986年，外贸部门通知他带样品去天津参加交易会，去后却没有一鸣惊人，问津者寥寥无几。
    车乐生回来后仔细琢磨原因，发现自己犯了狗尾续貂的毛病——把苇箔染上色以后反而失去了芦苇本来的风格。他当即还原了苇箔的本色，进一步改进了工艺，从制作简洁的图案发展到剪贴飞禽走兽、梅兰竹松，以至齐白石风格的“大虾”，徐悲鸿气派的“奔马”，并在此基础上，用苇箔粘贴出富于白洋淀特色的风物画。
    北京某工艺美术公司闻讯，与他商量联合做芦苇工艺品出口创汇有关事宜，提出两家分成，打北京工艺美术公司的牌子。车乐生一听，心想：这不是“大鱼吃小鱼”吗！“我不干！”他婉言谢绝了。
    车乐生决心提高芦苇工艺的“品位”，依靠自己的力量打开销路，特别是利用白洋淀来水、中外游客骤增的有利条件，把崭新的芦苇工艺推向世界。
    今年4月，香港大地发展公司朱总经理看到别具一格的芦苇工艺品，赞不绝口，当即与车乐生签了订货350万元的协议书。
    没几天，日本一位商人闻讯而至，观看了车乐生的芦苇工艺制品之后，很感兴趣，与他洽谈出口业务，签订了为期两年的出口合同。
    车乐生成功了。这个白洋淀土生土长的儿子，经过长年的苦苦的奋斗之后，终于实现了自己的人生价值，得到了社会的承认。
    在采访他时，我发现他并不将此看成是命运对他的青睐，而认为这关联到白洋淀人文化的深层结构，关联着水乡物质文明和精神文明等多种综合因素。
    记得我在白洋淀中心的郭里口村见到村党支部书记邓黑子时，发现他并不黑，穿一身灰呢西服，留一个大背头，很有点城里人的派头。
    在我的印象里，作为一个农村基层的党务工作者，能像他这样克勤克俭，尽职尽责，任劳任怨者似已不多见。他既能顺应改革开放之大势，又能“两个文明”一起抓，使郭里口村成为保定地区在省先进文明村评比中夺魁的两个村之一。
    那一天，到了吃饭的时候。他把我引到离村子不远的荷花淀中央一个水上窝棚里，说：“本该招待招待你，钱，也出得起。可中央三令五申不准请客，我们总不能当耳旁风。干脆到咱们村的打鱼点上吃一顿清水鱼吧！”他的话实在、干脆，在情在理，使我这等吃滑了嘴的记者听了，也感慨万分。
    是夜，我就借宿于这“水榭”之上，与渔民抵足而眠。夜半水凉，习习荷风送来渔村编席女人的轻唱，可惜时过中秋，月亮升不起来，否则就能看见孙犁在《荷花淀》里所描绘的“柔滑修长的苇篾子”在“女人怀里跳跃着”的景象……
