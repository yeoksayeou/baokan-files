Upon the conclusion of the World Cup Badminton Tournament, Chinese champion Zhao Jianhua immediately boarded the 16th express train back to Beijing. "Why are you returning so quickly? Why not rest a bit in Guangzhou?" the reporter asked on the train. "I need to get back quickly to train for next year's Asian Games. We need to perform well in front of our home crowd," he replied hurriedly, as if someone were chasing him. Then, Zhao Jianhua shared his thoughts on the recent tournament.

He began by discussing the performance of several top players and then extended the conversation to the topic of improving skills. Zhao Jianhua said, "The Indonesian players, Rung Rung and Adi, played well. They are quite young but have reached this level, which is impressive. Rung Rung has a flexible wrist and versatile techniques; Adi is improving rapidly and has defeated many top players. The South Korean men's doubles and mixed doubles teams have good coordination and strong techniques, making them difficult to compete against."

"How do you plan to counter these opponents in the future?" the reporter asked. Zhao Jianhua had already given this question considerable thought and discussed it comprehensively. He said, "Just defending is not enough. You defend against their fast attacks, and they come to the net. Techniques are ever-changing, and you can't defend against everything. There's a Chinese saying, 'When you knock down one gourd, another pops up,' which means exactly this. The key is to improve your own techniques, to lay a solid foundation. No matter what tricks they have, I can attack them, and no matter what ball they hit, I can break it. Of course, this doesn't mean you shouldn't study your opponents, but you should do so on the basis of being strong yourself. My match against Yang Yang was very tough, with three sets and high scores. The reason is that we both know each other well—what ball he hits and from which direction he attacks, we both have a good idea, making it hard for either of us."

Zhao Jianhua believes that a good player should have a comprehensive set of skills, able to both attack and defend, and should also have a "secret weapon"—attack to win, defend to hold. Nowadays, with the rapid development of badminton in various countries, relying on past achievements is no longer enough to win. You must excel in technique. Chinese players' strengths in fine technique, agile footwork, and clever placement should be continued, while also learning from others' good methods and experiences.

Finally, Zhao Jianhua praised the style of Malaysian player Foo Kok Song, saying he fights hard, can turn the tide of a match, and dares to compete against any opponent, even when far behind in the score. We should learn from such players and toughen our spirit.

### 在技术和作风上下苦功——列车上访羽毛球名将赵剑华

　　在技术和作风上下苦功
　　——列车上访羽毛球名将赵剑华
    世界杯羽毛球赛一结束，我国名将赵剑华即登上16次特别快车返京。“怎么这样快就回去，不在广州休息一下？”记者在车上问。“得快点回去训练，准备明年亚运会。在家门口比赛，总得像个样子才行。”他回答得很急促，像身后有什么人赶着似的。接着，赵剑华谈了对这次大赛的一点感受。
    他从几名好手在场上的表现谈起，然后引伸到如何提高技艺的问题。赵剑华说，印尼的王莲香和阿迪打得不错，他们年龄都不大，就达到这个水平，了不起。王莲香手腕灵活，技术全面；阿迪进步快，已经击败过不少名将。南朝鲜的男双、混双配合好，技术强，难以同其抗衡。
    “对这些对手，日后如何防呢？”记者问。赵剑华对这个问题已深思熟虑，谈得较全面。他说，光防是不够的，你防了他的快攻，他又来网前，技术千变万化，防不胜防，中国有句俗话，按倒葫芦起来瓢，就是这个意思。关键是提高自己的技术，把根基扎牢，不管他有什么招，我可攻他，不管他打什么球，我能破他。当然不是说不要研究对手，而是要在本身过硬的前提下去研究捉摸他。我同杨阳那场球就很难打，一共打了3局，比分都很高。原因就是我们都比较了解，他来什么球，从什么方向攻，心里有数，彼此都难打。
    赵剑华认为，一个好选手技术应该全面，能攻能防，同时要有“杀手锏”，攻能克，防能抵挡。现在由于各国羽毛球运动发展快，都在提高，靠吃老本已难取胜了，必须在技艺上强过人家才行。中国选手技术细腻、步伐灵活、落点刁的特点要继续发扬，同时可吸收别人的好打法、好经验。
    最后，赵剑华称赞了马来西亚选手傅国强的作风，说他拚劲足，能反败为胜，不管遇到什么选手都敢拚，即使在比分落后很多的情况下，亦不放松斗志。我们应向这样的选手学习，磨练斗志。　本报记者　黄振中
