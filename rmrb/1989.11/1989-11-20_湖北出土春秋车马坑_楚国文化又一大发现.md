A recently unearthed car and horse pit from the Spring and Autumn Period in Hubei Province is the largest of its kind discovered to date. Experts believe this is a significant discovery in the archaeological study of Chu culture.

The pit is located in Luogan Village, Huzhou Town, Yicheng County, Hubei Province, approximately 7.5 kilometers southeast of the Chu Royal City. The pit is rectangular, measuring 22.2 meters in length, 4.2 to 4.8 meters in width, and 1.5 to 1.6 meters in depth. Inside the pit, seven cars are arranged horizontally from south to north. Among them, cars numbered 4, 6, and 7 are well-preserved and have similar structures: double wheels, single shafts, crossbars, and car bodies, but no canopies, indicating they were practical war chariots. The pit contains 18 horses, and the majority of the horse bones can be used to determine their postures, directions, and the number of horses corresponding to each car. Based on the shapes and patterns of the four bronze car fittings and one small bronze bell found in the pit, it is confirmed that the artifacts date back to the Spring and Autumn Period.

The history of horse-drawn chariots in China spans at least 3,000 years. Previously, car and horse pits related to Chu culture have been discovered in Xichuan, Huaiyang in Henan Province, and Jiangling in Hubei Province. However, these pits either have poor preservation, small scale, or are from later periods.

    湖北出土春秋车马坑  楚国文化又一大发现
    据新华社武汉11月19日电　（记者罗辉）湖北省最近发掘出一处迄今规模最大的春秋时期楚国的车马坑。有关专家认为，这是楚文化考古的又一重大发现。
    据介绍，这个车马坑位于湖北省宜城县璞河镇护州村罗岗，在已发掘的楚皇城东南约7.5公里。坑呈长方形，长22.2米，宽4.2—4.8米，深1.5—1.6米。坑内7辆车横置，自南至北排列有序。其中4、6、7号车保存较好，形制基本相同，都是双轮、独辕、衡、车舆，未见车伞，是实用的战车。坑内有18匹马，从马骨大多能判明其姿势、朝向，以及与各辆车相配的马匹数。根据坑中所出的4件铜车器和1件小铜铃的形制与花纹，已确认其年代为春秋时期。
    我国的马车，至少有3000多年的历史。与楚文化相关的车马坑过去曾在河南淅川、淮阳和湖北江陵等地发现，但它们或保存较差，或规模较小，亦或年代较晚。
