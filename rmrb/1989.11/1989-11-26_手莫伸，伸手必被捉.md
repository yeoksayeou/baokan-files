When a river embankment collapses, people take emergency measures and first need to find out where the breach occurred. When a model worker transforms into an economic criminal, everyone is astonished and wants to know where he took his first step towards the abyss, so as to draw the necessary lessons from it. This is the purpose of publishing this article analyzing the crimes of Yu Mingyue.

Yu Mingyue, who can be said to have struggled for half his life, used to not even waste a piece of white paper or a rope. His transformation seems to have started with a "small matter": seeing the procurement officer receiving a large amount of bonus money, while he himself, after a year of hard work, only received over 100 yuan, he felt that it was "not worth it" and wanted to "find ways to compensate."

If we talk about such "not worth it" things, there are actually quite a few in life. Some people care about it, some do not; the same person, sometimes cares, sometimes does not. Yu Mingyue used to sleep on a cold three-foot counter, just donated blood and then carried over a hundred jin of agricultural supplies to the countryside, and never mentioned whether it was worth it or not, because at that time he "always wanted to do more to repay the Party's kindness." It has been proven that a person, as long as they think more about the Party's cause and do more, will not overly calculate personal gains and losses; will always maintain that spirit of hard work, and make their work better and better.

Perhaps someone will ask: Do we have to work without expecting any reward? Of course, that is not the intention. In life, most of the so-called "not worth it" things reflect a problem of unfair social distribution. This has already attracted the attention of the Party and the state, and efforts are being made to solve it. Solving problems takes time, and even after adjustments in the future, there will still be no absolute fairness. Things like working hard but receiving little bonus will still exist, and we will ask party members and cadres to take the lead in doing such things.

If one sees "not worth it" things and wants to avoid them, pushing them to others to do; if one suffers a little loss and does not hesitate to make up for it, swearing not to rest until one "grabs a handful" ... as long as one has power in hand, achieving these goals is not difficult. However, remember this advice: Hands off, reach out and you will be caught. Yu Mingyue is a warning. A party member, a party cadre, for the cause of socialist revolution, if there is no spirit of self-sacrifice, then this life is not worth living. Grabbing a handful, initially it seems "worth it"; but if one commits a crime, isn't that an even greater "not worth it"? Struggle is our party's fine tradition. If we abandon it, our thoughts will go astray, and we will inevitably go down the wrong path. The transformation starts here!

When the People's Liberation Army advanced into the Southwest, Deng Xiaoping talked about rectifying the party's style and said: "As a Communist Party member, one should put work in the first place and not calculate enjoyment. One should understand that our lives cannot be separated from the living standards of society." (_Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping_, page 159) Forty years have passed in the blink of an eye, and our country has undergone tremendous changes, but the foundation is weak, and the people's living standards are still not high. Every Communist Party member and state cadre should have this in mind and continue to carry forward the spirit of dedication.

### 手莫伸，伸手必被捉
万兴

　　手莫伸，伸手必被捉
　　万兴
    江堤崩塌，人们采取急救措施时，首先要找出在什么地方决口。一个劳动模范蜕变成经济犯罪分子，大家在惊愕之余，普遍关注的是他在哪里迈出走向深渊的第一步，以便从中吸取应有的教训。这，就是我们刊登剖析余明煜犯罪这篇报道的目的。
    说得上是艰苦奋斗半辈子的余明煜，过去连一张白纸、一根麻绳都舍不得浪费。他的蜕变似乎是从一件“小事”开始：看到采购员拿着大把大把的奖金，相比之下自己辛苦一年才领回100多元钱，于是感到“真不合算”，要“想方设法进行补偿”。
    要说这类“不合算”的事，生活中还真不少，有人计较，有人不太计较；同一个人，有时计较，有时又不大计较。余明煜当年睡冰凉的三尺柜台，刚献完血又挑起百十斤重的农用物资下乡，就不曾提出合算不合算，因为他当时“总想多干点事来报答党的恩情”。事实证明，一个人只有对党的事业想得多一些，干得多一些，才不会过多地计较个人的合算不合算；才会永远保持那么一股干劲，把自己的工作搞得好上加好。
    也许有人要问：难道又要我们工作不计报酬吗？当然不是这个意思。生活中一些所谓“不合算”的事，绝大多数反映的是个社会分配不公的问题。这已经引起了党和国家的重视，并正在着手解决。解决问题得有个过程，即便将来调整之后，也不会出现绝对的公平，类似工作辛苦、奖金不多这样“不合算”的事仍然还会有，并且要求我们当党员的，当干部的带头去做。
    如果看到“不合算”的事就想躲着走，推给人家去干；吃了点亏就不择手段地弥补，不伸手“捞一把”誓不罢休……只要手中有权，达到这些目的都不难。不过，请记住这样的忠告：手莫伸，伸手必被捉。余明煜就是前车之鉴。一个党员、一个党的干部为了社会主义革命事业，假如没有一点自我牺牲精神，那这个命是革不好的。捞了一把，初看上去“合算”了；可是犯了罪，岂不是更大的不合算？艰苦奋斗是我们党的优良传统，丢掉了它，思想出了岔，势必就要往邪路上走。蜕变就从这里开始！
    当年解放军挺进大西南，邓小平同志谈到整顿党的作风时曾经说道：“作为一个共产党员，要把工作放在第一位，不应当计较享受。要弄清楚，我们的生活不能脱离社会的生活水准。”（《邓小平文选》第159页）转眼40年过去了，我们国家发生了翻天覆地的变化，但底子薄，人民的生活水平仍然不高。每个共产党员、国家干部的心中都应该有这笔账，继续发扬奉献精神。
