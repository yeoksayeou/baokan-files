The Tibet Mountaineering Team Strengthens Cultural Education and Training

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, November 24 - (Reporters Wang Yongzhi, Duoji Zhuandui) China's famous mountaineer and Deputy Director of the Tibet Autonomous Region Sports Commission, Gongbu, said on the 23rd at the farewell ceremony for 15 members of the Tibet Mountaineering Team departing for Chengdu for training that since the second half of 1988, the Tibet Mountaineering Team has strengthened cultural education and multi-skilled training, and has already seen results.

Tibetan athletes have strong high-altitude adaptability and carrying capacity, but their cultural level is relatively low, their mountaineering knowledge is limited, and their technical skills are single, which is not suitable for the diversified trend of world mountaineering and is not conducive to the arrangement of athletes after retirement. Therefore, the Tibet Autonomous Region Sports Commission decided to strengthen cultural education within the mountaineering team and carry out multi-skilled training.

From the second half of 1988 to the first half of 1989, the team members trained for five and a half days a week and studied Chinese, Tibetan, foreign languages, and mathematics for five and a half days. Now, those Tibetan athletes who came from rural areas and had either not attended school or only completed primary school can all write letters in Tibetan or Chinese. The mountaineering team members have also received various specialized skill trainings. In May, the team conducted two weeks of rock climbing training, and ten team members went to the Soviet Union, the United States, and Japan to learn climbing techniques to prepare for next year's mountaineering activities. The mountaineering team also intends to train and improve the team members' social service capabilities. In the first half of the year alone, five liaison officers and six cooperation personnel were sent to assist foreign mountaineering teams. Currently, the team members remaining in Lhasa are learning to drive cars.

　　西藏登山队加强文化教育和训练
    新华社拉萨十一月二十四日电　（记者王永治、多吉占堆）中国著名登山运动员、西藏自治区体委副主任贡布二十三日在欢送西藏登山队十五名队员去成都集训时说，自一九八八年下半年开始，西藏登山队加强了文化教育和多项技能训练，现在已见成效。
    藏族队员高山适应性强，背力强，但文化水平较低，登山知识少，技术技能单一，不适应世界登山运动多样化的趋势，也不利于队员退役后的工作安排。为此，西藏自治区体委决定，在登山队内加强文化教育，并开展多项技能训练。
    自一九八八年下半年到一九八九年上半年，登山队员每周五个半天训练，五个半天学习汉文、藏文、外语和数学。现在，那些从农村来的没有上过学或只读过小学的藏族队员，都能用藏文或汉文写信。登山队员还接受了各种专项技能训练。今年五月，队员们进行了半个月的攀登岩石训练，还有十名队员先后去苏联、美国和日本学习攀登技术，为明年的登山活动作准备。登山队还有意锻炼和提高队员的社会服务能力，仅上半年就为外国登山队派出五名联络官和六名协作人员。现在，留在拉萨的队员正在学习开汽车。
