Education is a long-term systematic project. In the process of improving national quality and cultivating talent, middle schools and universities each have different tasks. However, these are two interconnected stages of a unified educational process. Middle school education is the foundation of university education, while university education is a continuation and development of middle school education. Studying the contradictions and problems that young students encounter during the transition from middle school to university can provide insights into how to cultivate well-rounded talent suitable for modern construction and how to carry out educational reforms.

The Mental State of Freshmen

Middle school graduates enter university through the college entrance examination. Upon entering university, their environment, status, and needs change significantly, which inevitably affects their psychological and ideological states. Freshmen often feel a sense of honor, novelty, and responsibility. It is important to acknowledge that these are positive psychological states. However, there are also some negative and unhealthy mental states, such as:

1. **Superiority Complex**: Some students have always been the "darlings" of their families and the "stars" of their schools, receiving constant admiration. They feel they are the "winners" of the intense college entrance examination competition and the "outstanding" among their peers. This sense of superiority makes them arrogant, further nurturing the traits of "arrogance" and "spoiledness."

2. **Sense of Loss**: Some students who were always at the top of their class in middle school, or were respected student leaders, find themselves mediocre among their talented peers in university. They feel disgruntled; others lack interest in their school or major, feeling they have "taken the right path but entered the wrong door," leading to a gloomy and frustrated mindset. These factors can make some freshmen feel depressed, confused, and lose their edge.

3. **Sense of Security**: Some freshmen believe that entering university means securing a "stable job" and a "safe future," with a promising career ahead. This sense of security makes them think, "The ship has reached the dock, the train has reached the station," leading to a lackadaisical attitude towards their studies.

The transition from middle school to university often sees a mix of positive and negative aspects, requiring education and guidance to foster their strengths and discard their weaknesses.

It is particularly important to note that some young students, transitioning from the relatively closed environment of middle school to the more open environment of university, lack psychological resilience. The sudden expansion of their spiritual life and the vast ocean of knowledge can leave them bewildered, unsure of what to choose. Coupled with their curiosity, they become interested in things they have never encountered before. However, due to their limited understanding of Marxism-Leninism and lack of discernment, they are easily influenced by bourgeois liberalization and other erroneous ideologies. For example, some students admire Western bourgeois political systems without critical analysis; others idolize biographies of bourgeois figures, using them as role models; some blindly believe in religious philosophies encountered in books; others become engrossed in novels, neglecting their professional studies, leading to failing grades in multiple courses. A few are so captivated by foreign novels and lowbrow magazines that they blindly imitate, leading them astray. These phenomena should be given serious attention.

Once students enter higher education, they come from all directions, and various social information converges there. However, due to their limited knowledge, experience, and narrow-mindedness, they sometimes struggle to distinguish right from wrong. They can be influenced by both the positive and negative aspects of social information. Sometimes, facing complex situations, they feel lost, even going with the flow, parroting others, and becoming overly self-confident and self-admiring. This can lead to one-sided thinking and emotional extremism. Under certain conditions, their thoughts and actions can deviate from the correct path, leading them astray.

Exploring Thought Education for Freshmen

From the perspective of higher education principles, the education of freshmen plays a foundational role in the entire university education process. Here are some views on how to improve and strengthen the ideological and political education of freshmen:

1. **Strengthen the Education of Marxist Basic Theories**

   Systematically conducting Marxist basic theory education is a crucial part of ideological and political education in higher education, forming the theoretical foundation for students to develop a scientific worldview and revolutionary outlook on life. Currently, freshmen from middle schools generally lack a solid foundation in Marxism. This is related to the deficiencies in political education in middle schools. Many high school political courses focus on aligning with the college entrance examination rather than the students' ideological needs, resulting in a discrepancy between students' political exam scores and their actual ideological performance.

   Higher education institutions should reform Marxist basic theory courses based on the current era and the changing conditions of contemporary university students. In freshman political theory courses, it is also necessary to conduct surveys and research to understand students' actual level of Marxist basic theory knowledge and their ideological situation, enabling targeted improvements and strengthening of Marxist basic theory education for freshmen.

2. **Educate Students to Establish Correct Struggle Goals**

   Middle school students, especially those with excellent academic performance, often have a clear goal before entering university: "to get into college." Once in university, what's next? In which direction should they strive? Many are unclear about this. Therefore, politically, students should be educated to strive for the ideal of building a socialist modernized country. For advanced students, they should be guided to strive for the lofty ideal of realizing communism. For politically exemplary and progressive Young Pioneers, they should be encouraged to apply for party membership. In addition to political ideals, students should also be helped to establish career ideals. Those studying engineering should aspire to be competent engineers, those studying education should aspire to be excellent teachers, and those studying medicine should aspire to be good doctors. Students should be guided to use their political and career ideals as motivation to plan their university life, with both short-term and long-term goals.

3. **Combine Ideological Education with Discipline Enforcement**

   After freshmen enter university, various objective and subjective factors can lead to conflicts and problems, requiring timely guidance and assistance from educators. For example, some students are used to relying on their parents and struggle to manage their own lives independently; others face declining grades due to adapting to university teaching and learning methods; some lack interest and motivation in their chosen major; others feel lonely after leaving their familiar social circles. These issues require timely understanding and assistance.

   In the ideological and political work for freshmen, it is important to combine care and support with strict discipline. Students should be guided positively while being reminded of the rules, helping them understand what is right and wrong and encouraging them to comply voluntarily. If disciplinary issues among freshmen are ignored, it can lead to a lack of distinction between right and wrong, suppressing positive energy, and preventing the formation of a good class and school culture. Starting with freshmen and focusing on lower grades can yield good results.

4. **Guide Students to Engage with Social Reality and Participate in Social Practice**

   Currently, university students enter higher education directly through the college entrance examination, living and studying in a relatively narrow circle from "home" to "school," with limited understanding of society, national conditions, and various hardships. This is a significant weakness. Therefore, during university, it is necessary to guide students to see the world and gain experience. The teaching of various majors in higher education institutions should genuinely implement the principle of combining theory with practice. Especially for social science majors, teaching should be closely linked to social reality. Those studying education theory should know the current state of education in China, and those studying economic theory should understand the current state of economic reform in China. Only then can they apply what they learn, avoiding the negative academic trend of disconnecting theory from practice.

   Higher education institutions should also pay attention to guiding students to participate in social practice. While studying book knowledge, university students should appropriately participate in social practice, such as conducting social surveys, providing consulting services to society, organizing various study classes during vacations, and using their professional knowledge to contribute to their hometown's development. Participating in social practice helps students complete and enrich their knowledge, gain skills, and experience, and improve their work abilities and ideological levels. Only by engaging with social reality and participating in social practice can university students with only book knowledge recognize their weaknesses and shortcomings, think more practically, and become more mature in their thoughts.

    从中学生到大学生
    ——关于加强高校思想政治教育的思考
    严正
    教育是一项周期性较长的系统工程。在提高民族素质、培养人才的过程中，中学与大学各自担负着不同的任务。但这是统一教育过程的两个互相联系、互相衔接的阶段。中学教育是大学教育的基础，大学教育是中学教育的继续与发展。研究青年学生从中学到大学的过渡阶段所碰到的矛盾和问题，对于探讨怎样培养德才兼备适应现代化建设所需要的人才，怎样进行教育改革，是有所启示的。
    新生入学后的心态
    中学毕业生通过高考进入大学。上了大学，环境、地位、需求都发生了很大的变化，这对于他们的心理和思想状态不能不发生很大的影响。刚入学的大学新生，颇有光荣感、新奇感和责任感。应当肯定，这是一些积极的心理状态。但是，也存在着若干消极的、不健康的心态。例如：
    1、优越感。有的学生从小就是家庭里的“宝贝”、学校里的“尖子”，一贯受到宠爱。他们感到自己是剧烈的高考竞争中的“胜利者”、同龄人中的“佼佼者”。这种优越感使他们飘飘然，使得原来已经存在的“骄”、“娇”二气有了进一步的滋长。
    2、失落感。有些学生在中学阶段学习上一直处于领先地位，有的还是受器重的学生干部，入学后在人才荟萃的同学中却显得平平，内心不服气；也有些学生对学校或专业缺乏兴趣，认为“走对了路、进错了门”，心里郁郁不欢。这些都会使某些大学新生情绪低落，思想苦闷，锐气顿消。
    3、安全感。有的大学新生认为，上了大学，拿到了“铁饭碗”，进了“保险箱”，不仅未来职业有了保障，而且“前程似锦”。这种安全感使他们产生了“船到码头车到站”的念头，学习上得过且过。
    青年学生从中学到大学的过渡阶段，积极面和消极面有时还是交织存在的，需要通过教育与引导，扬其所长，弃其所短。
    特别应当指出，一些青年学生从中学的比较封闭的环境进入大学的比较开放的环境，心理上缺乏承受力。精神生活领域的骤然扩大，面对知识的海洋，使一些人眼花缭乱，不知如何选择为好。加上青年人有猎奇思想，他们对过去没有接触过的东西，发生了探索的兴趣。但由于马列主义水平不高，缺乏正确的鉴赏能力，往往容易受资产阶级自由化思想以及其他错误思潮的影响。例如有的学生对西方的资产阶级政治制度，不加分析，欣赏备至；有的读了资产阶级人物的传记，无比佩服，以此作为自己学习的楷模；有的在书本中接触到宗教的人生哲学，盲目相信；也有的读小说着了迷，以致废弃专业学习，出现几门功课不及格的现象。极个别的被外国小说和情趣低下的刊物中的一些消极情节弄得神魂颠倒，盲目仿效，以致走上了邪路。这些现象，应该引起我们的高度重视。
    学生进了高等学校，同学来自四面八方，许多社会信息通过各种渠道在那里交汇，但由于他们知识、经验不足，阅历不广，主见不多，有时就分不清是非曲直，既容易受社会信息中积极因素的影响，也能为其中的消极因素所左右。有时面对复杂的情况，感到无所适从，甚至随波逐流，人云亦云，盲目自信，孤芳自赏，导致思想上的片面性与情绪上的偏激性。在一定的条件下，他们的思想和行动就会偏离正确的方向，走到邪路上去。
    低年级学生的思想教育探索
    从高等教育的规律来看，大学低年级的教育，在整个大学教育阶段起着奠基的重要作用。这里，就如何改善和加强大学低年级学生的思想政治教育工作谈一些看法：
    第一、加强马克思主义的基本理论教育。
    系统地进行马克思主义的基本理论教育，是高等学校思想政治教育的一项重要内容，是大学生形成科学世界观与革命人生观的理论基础。当前，来自中学的大学新生，马克思主义基础知识贫乏是一个普遍现象。这同中学的政治课教学存在的缺陷有关。因为有不少中学高中的政治课教学往往只考虑同高考
  “对口”，而忽视同学生的思想“对口”。其结果出现了学生高考的政治科成绩与实际的思想表现大相径庭的不正常现象。
    高等学校应根据时代的发展与已经发生了变化的当代大学生的情况，对马克思主义基本理论教育课作认真的改革。在大学低年级政治理论课教学中，还应做好调查研究工作，既要了解学生马克思主义基本理论知识的实际水平，又要摸清学生的思想情况，以便有针对性地改进与加强低年级大学生的马克思主义基本理论教育。
    第二，教育学生树立正确的奋斗目标。
    中学生，特别是学业成绩比较优良的高中毕业生，未入大学前，很多人有一个奋斗目标，那就是“考大学”。进了大学，下一步该怎么办？今后应该朝哪个方向努力？对此，不少人是模糊的。为此，在政治上，要教育学生树立为建设社会主义现代化国家而努力奋斗的理想。对学生中的先进分子，还要引导他们树立为实现共产主义而奋斗的崇高理想。对那些政治上一贯表现好、积极要求进步的共青团员，应鼓励他们申请入党。除了政治理想之外，还要帮助学生树立职业理想。学工科的要立志做一名称职的工程师，学师范的要立志当一名优秀的人民教师，学医学的要立志做一名人民的好医生。要引导学生以自己的政治理想与职业理想为动力，来规划自己大学阶段的学习生活，既有近景目标，又有远景目标。
    第三、坚持思想教育与纪律约束相结合。
    新生入学后，由于许多主客观的原因，会碰到不少矛盾与问题，需要教育者予以及时的指导与帮助。例如有的学生一贯依赖家长，入学后不会独立地安排自己的生活；有的由于不适应大学的教学方式和学习方式而成绩下降；有的对所学专业缺乏认识与志趣，在学习上内驱力不足；还有的由于离开了原来熟悉的生活小圈子而产生了孤独感，等等。这些，都需要及时地掌握情况，予以指导与帮助。
    在大学新生的思想政治工作中，要把关心爱护与严格要求结合起来，把思想教育与纪律约束结合起来。对学生既要坚持正面疏导，又要申明纪律，使学生知所趋避，自觉遵守。如果对大学新生中违反纪律的现象放任自流，不加过问，其结果就会导致是非不分，正气不伸，良好的班风、校风就无法形成。在纪律问题上，从新生抓起，从低年级抓起，才能收到好的效果。
    第四、引导学生接触社会实际，并适当地参加社会实践。
    当前大学生都是通过高考直接进入高等学校的，他们从“家门”到“校门”，一直在比较狭小的圈子中生活和学习，对社会了解甚少，对民情和国情知之甚微，没有尝过各种艰难困苦，这不能不说是一个弱点。因此，在大学期间，引导学生看看社会，见见世面，是十分必要的。高等学校各个专业的教学，要切实贯彻理论与实际相结合的原则。特别是社会科学各个专业的教学，更要紧密地联系社会实际。学教育理论的应当知道我国当前教育的现状，学经济理论的应当了解我国经济改革的现状，只有这样，才能学以致用，克服理论与实际相脱节的不良学风。
    走出“家门”“校门”的小圈子
    高等学校还要重视引导学生参加社会实践。大学生在学习书本知识的同时，应适当地参加社会实践，如进行社会调查，为社会提供咨询服务，利用假期举办各种学习班，用专业知识为家乡建设作贡献等等。大学生参与社会实践，有助于完善与充实自己的知识，增长才干，获得经验，并有助于提高自己的工作能力与思想水平。也只有接触社会实际，参加社会实践，才能使只有书本知识的年轻的大学生，认识自身的弱点和不足，考虑问题更实际些，思想上更成熟些。
