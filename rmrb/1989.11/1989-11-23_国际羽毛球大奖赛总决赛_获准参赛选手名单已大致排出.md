The list of players qualified to participate in the International Badminton Grand Prix Final has been largely determined.

According to the current points situation, China's "Knight" Zhao Jianhua has lost his chance to participate in the International Badminton Grand Prix Final, and another player, Wu Wenkai, is also at risk of losing his opportunity.

According to coach Hou Jiachang, China will definitely not send a team to compete in the final leg of the Grand Prix—the Scottish Open. In other words, Zhao Jianhua, who is currently in 16th place with 540 points, has no hope. As for Wu Wenkai, although he currently has 640 points and is in 14th place, he is only 10 points ahead of the 15th-placed Danish player Frederiksen. If the latter can gain more than 10 points from the Scottish Open, Wu Wenkai will also lose his qualification.

However, world champions Yang Yang and Xiong Guobao will definitely participate in the final. Other top players from around the world who are also on the list include Denmark's Frost and Holsersen, Indonesia's Wei Renfang, Adi, Lu Tianning, and Malaysia's Fu Guangqiang. Female players include China's Tang Jiuhong, Huang Hua, and Han Aiping, Indonesia's Wang Lianxiang, and England's Trock.

　　国际羽毛球大奖赛总决赛
　　获准参赛选手名单已大致排出
    本报讯　根据目前积分情况看，中国“侠客”赵剑华已失去了参加国际羽毛球大奖赛总决赛资格，而另一名选手吴文凯也有失去机会的危险。
    据教练侯加昌透露，中国肯定不会派队参加大奖赛最后一站——苏格兰公开赛的角逐。换言之，目前以540分排在第16位的赵剑华已没有希望了。至于吴文凯，他目前虽得640分，排第14位，仅比排在第15位的丹麦选手弗雷德里克森多出10分，如果后者能从苏格兰公开赛获得超过10分的话，吴文凯也将失去参赛资格。
    不过，世界冠军杨阳和熊国宝肯定会参加总决赛。其他在名单内的世界各路好手还包括丹麦的弗罗斯特和霍尔拉森，印度尼西亚的魏仁芳、阿迪、罗天宁以及马来西亚的傅国强等，女选手有中国的唐九红、黄华、韩爱平，印尼的王莲香和英格兰的特罗克等。
