Ryzhkov Meets with Miner Representatives and Warns Miners Not to Be Used by Certain Forces

	MOSCOW, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) — Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov said today that the recent strike by miners in the northern Russian city of Vorkuta is being exploited by certain forces for political purposes.

	According to TASS, Ryzhkov made the remarks while meeting with miner representatives from various regions.

	Soviet coal miners went on strike in July this year, demanding greater economic autonomy and improved working and living conditions. After the government issued a resolution to meet the miners' reasonable demands, the workers returned to work. On Oct. 25, miners in Vorkuta went on strike again, citing poor implementation of the resolution. So far, they have failed to produce tens of millions of tons of coal, affecting steel production and the lives of residents.

	Ryzhkov pointed out, "If we cannot work effectively, beautiful wishes and resolutions will all become empty talk." He urged miners to "take national economic issues seriously." So far, the country has fallen short of coal production by 14 million tons.

	Ryzhkov appealed to miners not to be used as tools in political struggles.

　　雷日科夫会见矿工代表
　　提醒矿工不要被某些势力利用
    新华社莫斯科11月17日电　苏联政府首脑雷日科夫17日指出，俄罗斯北部沃尔库塔矿工日前的罢工，正在被某些势力用来达到政治目的。
    据塔斯社报道，雷日科夫是在会见各地矿工代表时讲这番话的。
    苏联煤矿工人曾于今年7月份举行罢工，要求更多的经济自主权和改善劳动与生活条件。政府作出了满足矿工合理要求的决议后，工人复工。10月25日，沃尔库塔的煤矿工人以上述决议执行不力为由再次罢工，迄今已欠产煤炭几十万吨，影响了钢铁的生产和居民生活。
    雷日科夫指出，“如果我们不能有效地工作，美好的愿望和决议都将成为空话。”他要求矿工“严肃地对待国民经济问题”。迄今为止，全国煤炭欠产1400万吨。
    雷日科夫呼吁矿工不要被别人变成政治斗争的工具。
