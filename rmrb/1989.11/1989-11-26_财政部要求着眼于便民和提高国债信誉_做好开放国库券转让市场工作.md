The Ministry of Finance recently held a national treasury bond work conference in Wuhan, emphasizing the need to further improve the work of opening the treasury bond transfer market.

It is understood that China has so far issued a total of over 80 billion yuan in treasury bonds. This work has ensured the construction of national key projects, eased financial difficulties, and promoted reform and opening up. Since April 1988, China has partially opened the treasury bond transfer market. According to incomplete statistics, the transaction volume of the treasury bond transfer market in 61 pilot cities nationwide has reached 3.5 billion yuan, of which 2.1 billion yuan was purchased.

On behalf of Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Wang Binqian, Financial Advisor Tian Yinong emphasized at the meeting on opening the treasury bond transfer market that this work must be beneficial to the convenience of the public and to enhancing the credibility of treasury bonds. For price fluctuations in the market that are detrimental to the credibility of national debt, the financial and banking departments should take necessary interventions and controls. For intermediary institutions handling treasury bond transfers, if any illegal activities such as profiteering that harm the credibility of treasury bonds are discovered, the financial and banking departments have the right to stop and rectify them. Strictly crack down on "ticket scalpers" engaged in black market transactions.

　　财政部要求着眼于便民和提高国债信誉
　　做好开放国库券转让市场工作
    新华社武汉11月24日电　（记者梅君）财政部日前在此间召开全国国债工作会议，要求进一步做好开放国库券转让市场的工作。
    据了解，目前我国已累计发行国债800多亿元，这项工作保证了国家重点建设，缓和了财政困难，促进了改革开放。1988年4月始，我国部分开放了国库券转让市场。据不完全统计，全国61个试点城市的国库券转让市场交易额已达35亿元，其中买进21亿元。
    受国务委员兼财政部长王丙乾委托，财政部顾问田一农在谈到开放国库券转让市场时强调，这项工作必须有利于方便群众和提高国库券信誉，对市场上出现的不利于国债信誉的价格波动，财政和银行部门要进行必要的干预和调控；办理国库券转让的中介机构，如发现从中牟利等损害国库券信誉的非法行为，财政和银行部门有权加以制止和整顿；坚决打击从事黑市交易的“票贩子”。
