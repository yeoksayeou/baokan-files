The first important agricultural conference after the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, the National Conference on Agricultural Comprehensive Development Experience Exchange, was held in Beijing today. Vice Premier Tian Jiyun delivered an important speech at the meeting on the current agricultural situation and tasks, agricultural comprehensive development, stabilizing rural basic economic policies, and rural work for the coming year.

State Councilor Chen Junsheng presided over the meeting.

In his speech, Tian Jiyun fully affirmed the tremendous achievements made in China's agricultural development, analyzed the current situation facing Chinese agriculture, pointed out the potential for agricultural development, and emphasized that there is great hope for the sustained and stable development of Chinese agriculture.

Tian Jiyun said that agricultural comprehensive development involves two main aspects: first, transforming existing medium and low-yield fields to increase output; second, developing and utilizing new agricultural resources. This is a major undertaking that has already had a good start. China has a large population, limited arable land, and a low level of production. It is difficult to meet the people's continuously improving living standards and the country's economic development needs by merely relying on existing resources. Therefore, we must break out of this cycle and develop new resources, opening up a new path. In China, two-thirds of the existing arable land needs to be transformed, and there are large areas of wasteland, barren hills, wasteland, and tidal flats that can be developed and utilized. Local governments, various levels of authorities, and millions of farmers are highly enthusiastic about agricultural development, have relatively reliable sources of development funds, and are greatly inspired by the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session. We must be determined and make great efforts to push forward agricultural comprehensive development, making it play a significant role in revitalizing Chinese agriculture. He said that to further promote agricultural comprehensive development, we must achieve the following: leadership attention and reliance on the masses; clear guidance and policies; scientific management, combining development with governance, and balancing social, ecological, and economic benefits; emphasis on infrastructure construction and technological investment; and the implementation of various forms of moderate-scale management from the outset of new agricultural comprehensive development.

Tian Jiyun said that the "Decision" passed by the Fifth Plenary Session clearly states: "Continue to deepen rural reforms and implement stable rural policies." We must resolutely implement this spirit. In his speech, he reiterated the rural basic economic policies that rural cadres and the vast majority of farmers are concerned about: the policy of implementing the household contract responsibility system with various forms of production; the policy of allowing and encouraging some regions and individuals to get rich first, with the goal of common prosperity; the policy of not relaxing grain production and actively developing diversified operations, and steadily adjusting and optimizing the rural industrial structure; the policy of encouraging and guiding the healthy development of township enterprises; the policy of developing various economic components under the premise of public ownership; and the policy of implementing a combination of planned economy and market regulation for the purchase and sale of major agricultural and sideline products, etc., maintaining stability. He pointed out that it is currently very important to stabilize rural basic policies and stabilize the minds of 800 million farmers, as this is a matter that affects the overall situation. Because these basic policies, from an overall perspective, are currently still in line with the level of rural social productive forces, they are conducive to protecting and mobilizing the socialist production enthusiasm of 800 million farmers and promoting the further development of rural productive forces. He said that in the past ten years, there have also been some problems in rural reform and rural economic development, and some policies and measures have been imperfect, which need to be further solved and improved, and this is also necessary. The new measures we have taken in the new situation are a deepening and improvement of the reform, not a change in basic policies.

Tian Jiyun said in his speech that the central task of rural work next year is to earnestly implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, resolutely implement the policies of rectification and deepening reform, and strive in every possible way to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture and promote the sustained and stable development of the rural economy and social stability. He emphasized: in any case, grain and cotton production next year must strive for a new breakthrough to end the stagnant situation. For next year's rural work, he summarized it as "six together": conventional agriculture and developed agriculture together, increasing the effective supply of agricultural products; material input and technological input together, more input and more output; economic development in developed areas and economic development in poor areas together, not neglecting one for the other; flood control and drought resistance together, each locality must enhance its disaster resistance capabilities, and must be prepared for disaster and bumper harvests; developing agricultural production and family planning together, solving China's agricultural and food problems, and strictly controlling the rapid growth of population and the occupation of arable land, while also emphasizing both increasing supply and reducing demand; material civilization and spiritual civilization construction together.

Vice Premier Tian Jiyun demanded that in the work of next year, all localities must take the task of vigorously developing agriculture, especially grain and cotton production, and ending the stagnant situation, as a hard task. All localities and departments must resolutely and unconditionally implement the central government's policy of tilting towards agriculture and truly implement it.

Representatives from all provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government responsible for agriculture, as well as representatives from relevant departments of the State Council, attended the meeting convened by the State Council.

    田纪云在全国农业综合开发经验交流会上强调
　　大力把农业综合开发搞上去
　　争取明年粮棉生产有新突破
　　稳定农村基本政策稳定八亿农民的心事关全局
    本报北京十一月二十七日讯　新华社记者王言彬、本报记者陈健报道：党的十三届五中全会之后的第一个重要的农业会议全国农业综合开发经验交流会议，今天在北京召开。国务院副总理田纪云在会上就当前的农业形势和任务、农业综合开发、稳定农村基本经济政策和明年农村工作等问题，作了重要讲话。
    国务委员陈俊生同志主持这次会议。
    田纪云在讲话中，充分肯定了我国农业发展取得的巨大成就，分析了我国农业所面临的形势，指出了农业发展的潜力，强调我国农业持续稳定发展是大有希望的。
    田纪云说，农业综合开发，一是对现有的中低产田进行改造，提高产出率；二是开发利用新的农业资源。这是一篇大文章，现在已经有了良好的开端。我国人口多、耕地少、生产水平低，只在现已利用的资源中转圈子是难以满足人民生活不断改善和国民经济不断发展需求的。这就要跳出来开发新的资源，开辟一条新的路子。我国现有耕地中，有三分之二的中低产田需要改造，还有大批的荒地、荒坡、荒水、荒滩可以开发利用。各地、各级和亿万农民对农业开发积极性很高，有较为可靠的开发资金来源，特别是有党的五中全会精神的巨大鼓舞，我们要下决心、下大力把农业综合开发搞上去，让它在振兴我国农业中发挥重大作用。他说，进一步搞好农业综合开发，要做到：领导重视、依靠群众；指导思想和方针政策要明确；要实行科学管理、开发与治理相结合，社会效益、生态效益、经济效益并重；要注重基础设施建设和科技投入；新的农业综合开发，一开始就要实行多种形式的适度的规模经营。
    田纪云说，五中全会通过的《决定》写得非常明确：“继续深化农村改革，执行稳定的农村政策。”要坚决执行这个精神。他在讲话中就农村干部和广大农民普遍关心的农村基本经济政策问题重申：实行以家庭经营为主的多种形式联产承包责任制的政策；以共同富裕为目标，允许和鼓励一部分地区和一部分人先富起来的政策；“绝不放松粮食生产、积极发展多种经营”，继续稳步调整优化农村产业结构的政策；鼓励和引导乡镇企业健康发展的政策；坚持在以公有制为主体的前提下发展多种经济成分的政策；对主要农副产品实行计划经济与市场调节相结合的购销政策等，保持稳定不变。他指出，当前稳定农村基本政策、稳定八亿农民的心，是非常重要的，这是关系到全局的问题。因为这些基本政策，从总体上讲，目前仍然适应农村社会生产力发展水平，有利于保护和调动八亿农民的社会主义生产积极性，促进农村生产力进一步发展。他说，在过去十年中，我们在农村改革和发展农村经济的某些方面也存在一些问题，在改革措施和政策方面也有不完善的地方，需要进一步加以解决和改善，这也是必要的。我们在新情况下采取的一些新措施，就是改革的深化和改善，而不是改变基本政策。
    田纪云在讲话中说，明年农村工作的中心任务是，认真贯彻党的十三届五中全会精神，坚决执行治理整顿和深化改革的方针，千方百计夺取农业丰收，促进农村经济持续、稳定发展和农村社会的安定。他着重指出：无论如何，明年粮棉生产要争取有个新的突破，结束徘徊局面。对明年的农村工作，他概括为“六个一起抓”：常规农业和开发农业一起抓，增加农产品的有效供给；物资投入和科技投入一起抓，多投入多产出；发达地区经济发展和贫困地区经济开发一起抓，不能顾此失彼；防汛与抗旱一起抓，各地必须增强抗灾能力，要立足于抗灾夺丰收；发展农业生产与计划生育一起抓，解决我国农业问题、粮食问题，一定要严格控制人口过快增长和耕地占用，同时要开源与节流并重；物质文明与精神文明建设一起抓。
    田纪云副总理要求各地在明年的工作中，要把大力发展农业、特别是发展粮棉生产，结束徘徊局面，作为一项硬任务来抓。各地、各部门要坚定不移地、不折不扣地执行中央决定的向农业倾斜的政策，并真正落实到实处。
    来自全国各省、市、自治区和计划单列市主管农业的负责同志以及国务院有关部门的负责同志出席了国务院召开的这次会议。
