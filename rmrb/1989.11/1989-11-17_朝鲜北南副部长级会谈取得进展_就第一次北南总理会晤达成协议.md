	North-South Korean vice-ministerial representatives held their fourth round of talks today at the "Unity Hall" on the North's side of the Panmunjom. The two sides made progress on the location and agenda for the first-ever meeting between the prime ministers of North and South Korea. Both sides expressed satisfaction with the results.

	During the more than two-hour-long talks today, the two sides reached two agreements: 1. The location for the first meeting between the prime ministers will be Seoul. 2. The agenda for the talks will be a comprehensive set of issues. However, there are still differences in the specific content. The North insists that the agenda should be a comprehensive set of issues to eliminate the political and military standoff between the North and the South. The South agrees with this agenda but also wants to include six proposals for multi-channel exchanges and cooperation.

	Regarding the name of the prime ministerial talks, the North insists on calling it the "North-South High-Level Political-Military Talks," while the South still wants it to be called the "South-North High-Level Government Leaders' Talks." Additionally, there are still differences in the composition of the delegations and the number of accompanying personnel. The North believes that the delegation should include at least two high-ranking military representatives. The South believes that one representative at the level of military chief of staff is sufficient. Regarding accompanying personnel, the North proposed 30 people, while the South suggested around 30.

	The two sides finally agreed to hold the fifth round of talks on December 20 on the South's side of Panmunjom.

    朝鲜北南副部长级会谈取得进展
    就第一次北南总理会晤达成协议
    本报板门店11月15日电　记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜北南副部长级代表今天在板门店北方一侧的“统一阁”举行第四次会谈，双方就第一次北南总理会晤的地点和议题取得进展。双方对这一成果表示满意。
    在今天两个多小时的会谈中，双方达成的两项协议是：1、双方总理第一次会晤的地点为汉城。2、会谈的议题，双方一致同意设一揽子议题。但在具体内容上，双方仍存在分歧。北方坚持会议的议题应是消除北南之间政治、军事对峙状态的一揽子议题。而南方表示同意这一议题，但又要求把南北多渠道交流、合作等六项建议列入议程。
    关于总理会谈的名称，北方坚持为“北南高级政治军事会谈”，而南方仍要求定为“南北高级当局领导人会谈”。另外，在代表团组成和随行人员问题上，双方还存在差距。北方认为，代表团中至少要有两名军以上实权代表参加。而南方认为，只要一名军参谋长级代表参加即可。在随行人员上，北方提出30人，南方则建议在30名左右。
    双方最后商定，12月20日在板门店南方一侧举行第五次会谈。
