	Mr. Cao Yu's masterpiece "Thunderstorm" has endured 55 years of tumultuous times. Recently, it was once again staged by the Beijing People's Art Theatre. Although time has passed, the plot and characters are well-known to the audience, but the audience still has a strong interest, with every performance being full and applause continuous.

	Over the past half-century, "Thunderstorm" has been performed continuously in China. Its performances in Hong Kong, Japan, the Soviet Union, Romania, Singapore, the United States, and Czechoslovakia have also been remarkable. It has become a classic work in the history of Chinese spoken drama. Such enduring and vigorous vitality is, of course, primarily due to the work itself, but it also benefits from the re-creation by directors and actors. Especially a theatre like the Beijing People's Art Theatre, which has national standards, has given "Thunderstorm" new artistic charm. This time, the director, Mr. Xia Chun, based on his 1954 direction of "Thunderstorm," has added new elements. He expanded the lightning and thunder from the stage to the entire theatre to increase the audience's sense of participation; he added a deer head decoration in Zhou Putuan's room and included a suit in Zhou's attire, making Zhou Putuan, this capitalist who is steeped in heavy feudal thoughts and has also studied in Germany, appear more complete; he emphasized the element of love in Fan Ruilian's complex emotions and added a bit of goodness to her eccentric personality. These innovative treatments of stage images make Fan Ruilian's psychology more in line with her specific environment. Staging old plays without innovation will find it difficult to generate appeal, and this has been a common problem in the theatre in recent years.

	This re-staging is particularly worth mentioning for the actors. On stage, except for Gu Wei, who plays Zhou Putuan, and Han Shanshu, who plays Lu Gui, and a few others, most are newcomers, young but with some experience. Zheng Tianwei plays Si Feng, Pu Cunxin plays Zhou Ping, Zhang Fuyuan plays Lu Dhai, Gong Lijun plays Fan Ruilian, etc. These new faces, compared to the past stage performances of Yu Shizhi, Su Min, Hu Zongwen, Dong Xingjie, and Zheng Rong, are inevitably immature, and there are also flaws in their performances. But for cultivating successors and maintaining the high level and style integrity of the Beijing People's Art Theatre, this is indeed a bold and wise move.

	What is the future of the Beijing People's Art Theatre? The brightness of the future mainly depends on whether there are successors. In the past, they could dominate the spoken drama stage because they had a large number of first-class directors and actors, deeply attracting tens of thousands of audiences. Even some medium-level scripts, under their excellent direction and acting, could be made brilliant. Many people went to watch plays, watching them multiple times or even dozens of times, just to see the performances of these actors and enjoy the artistic performance they brought. Now, some of them have passed away, and some are already old, while the talents of new actors are still in the process of learning and creating, gradually maturing, which cannot but cause concern for the broad audience who care about the Beijing People's Art Theatre. Mr. Xia Chun's bold use of new actors this time is a trial with strategic vision.

    江山代有才人出
    顾土
    曹禺先生的名作《雷雨》，时经55年的岁月激荡，最近又一次被北京人民艺术剧院搬上舞台，尽管时光荏苒，剧情、人物已为人们所熟知，但观众仍有强烈的兴趣，场场满座，掌声不断。
    半个世纪以来，《雷雨》在国内经演不衰，在香港、在日本、苏联、罗马尼亚、新加坡、美国、捷克斯洛伐克相继演出也是不同凡响。它已经成为中国话剧史上的经典作品。如此持久而旺盛的生命力，固然首先在于作品自身，但同时也受益于导演和演员们的再创造。尤其像北京人艺这样具有国家水准的剧院，曾赋予《雷雨》以新的艺术魅力。此次重演，导演夏淳先生在他1954年执导的《雷雨》的基础上又另有新意。他把电闪雷鸣从舞台扩展到全剧场，以增加观众的参与感；他在周朴园的房间内添置一鹿头的装饰，在周的衣着中加入西服，使周朴园这位浸透着浓重封建思想色彩而又曾留学德国的资本家的外观，显得更加完整；他在繁漪的复杂情感中加重了爱的成份，在她那乖戾性格里增添些许善的本性，这些舞台形象的创新处理，使繁漪的心理更为符合她的特定环境。上演老戏，如果缺乏创新色彩，就难以生发吸引力，而这正是近些年剧坛的常见病。
    这次重演，最值得一提的是演员。舞台上除了饰周朴园的顾威和饰鲁贵的韩善续等几人外，多是新人，年轻但有一定的经验。郑天玮演四凤，濮存昕演周萍，张福元演鲁大海，龚丽君演繁漪……等等。这些新面孔假若和过去的舞台上的于是之、苏民、胡宗温、董行佶、郑榕等相比，当然未免稚嫩，表演中亦存缺憾。但这对培养后继，保持北京人艺的高水平和风格完整来说，确为有胆有识的明智之举。
    北京人艺的前景如何？而前景的明暗主要取决于后继是否有人。过去他们能冠盖话剧舞台，就在于拥有一大批第一流水平的导演和演员，深深吸引了成千上万的观众。就连一些中等水准的剧本，在他们出色的导、演下，也能搞得神采飞扬。很多人去看戏，几遍甚至几十遍地看，无非为一睹这些演员们的风采，享受他们带来的艺术表演的愉悦感。如今，他们之中有的已作古，有的人年事已高，而新演员的才华又多处于边学边创逐渐走向成熟的阶段，不能不引起关心人艺的广大观众的焦虑。夏淳先生此次大胆起用新人，就是一次具有战略眼光的尝试。
