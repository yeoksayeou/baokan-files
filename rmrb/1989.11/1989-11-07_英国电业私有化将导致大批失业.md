A leaked government document reveals that the privatization of Britain's electricity industry could result in 30,000 job losses and the closure of one-third of its coal mines.

The document was leaked to the November 1 issue of the magazine *European Power*.

The document is reported to be a memorandum submitted by the Department of Energy to the Cabinet.

The document states: Within three years of privatization, Britain will be forced to close one-third of its deep coal mines.

Post-privatization companies will reduce coal orders by 15 million tons, directly leading to 18,000 job losses. Given the current demand for electricity, another 12,000 miners face the threat of being laid off.

Tony Blair, the Labour Party's spokesperson on energy issues, described this privatization as "utterly destructive."

The privatization of the electricity industry has faced strong opposition, and the government has postponed the auction by six months.

    英国电业私有化将导致大批失业
    据一份被泄露的政府文件表明，英国电力工业私有化可能导致3万人失业和1／3的煤矿倒闭。
    这份文件被泄露给11月1日出版的《欧洲动力》杂志。
    据悉，该文件是能源部向内阁提交的一份备忘录。
    文件说：在实行私有化3年之内，英国将被迫关掉1／3的深层煤矿。
    私有化后的公司将减少1500万吨煤的订货，直接导致1.8万人失业，按照目前的电力需求，另有1.2万名矿工面临裁员的危险。
    工党能源问题发言人托尼·布莱尔称这次私有化为“十足的破坏行为”。
    电力工业私有化已遭受到强烈的反对，政府已把拍卖活动推迟了6个月。
