About a hundred miles southeast of Changchun, the capital of Jilin Province, lies a small county called Shuangyang. Recently, an unusual incident occurred there involving the "snatching" of writers. Upon hearing the news, reporters rushed to the scene to investigate.

The writers in question were playwrights Zhang Fuxian and Zhang Huwen. Both Zhangs are farmers by origin and in their prime. Because they often collaborate on plays, they are known as the "Shuangyang Zhang Duo." They recounted to the reporters the events of their recent "abduction."

On June 27, the Shixi Township invited the Zhang Duo to help write a local opera titled "Forty Years of Change in Our Homeland." They were in the midst of gathering materials in various villages when the county Labor Bureau tracked them down, sent a car to the fields, and took them back to the guesthouse without explanation, effectively placing them under "house arrest" until the play was completed. The Zhang Duo's disappearance led to a flurry of phone calls from Shixi, Sheling, and other townships searching for them. Longling Township and Xin'an Town found them through an "insider" at the guesthouse. The Zhang Duo were at their wits' end. After completing the Labor Bureau's play, they immediately went to Longling to gather more materials. Two days later, they returned to the county seat, where Sheling Township seized the opportunity to "kidnap" them. The next day, the Zhang Duo were snatched back by Longling Township and hidden in the Senior Citizens' Home. They worked for three days straight, completing the street performances "Earth as Witness" and "Unexpected Success." At this point, Shixi Township learned they were attending a meeting in Changchun and sent a car to wait for them. As soon as the meeting ended, they were taken back to Shixi. The Zhang Duo stayed in Shixi for three days and two nights, finishing the script at 29th of July. Sheling Township came to pick them up and hid them in a kindergarten to write more plays. A few days later, they completed the Errenzhuan "Looking at the Lover" and the street performance "Reciprocating Courtesy." On August 10, the Zhang Duo went to Xin'an Town to work on the one-act play "Nameless Grass" and the skit "Family Education." From August 13 to 19, they shuttled between the four townships, watching rehearsals and revising scripts. On the evening of August 20, the Zhang Duo were editing a play in Sheling when Xin'an Town called to retrieve them. Sheling refused to let them go, so Xin'an Town sent people to drive to Sheling in the middle of the night to "snatch" them back...

Throughout the summer, the Zhang Duo were snatched back and forth, busy beyond measure, passing by their homes several times but unable to enter. Zhang Huwen humorously said, "Summer has passed, and we haven't even tasted the green corn at home." Zhang Fuxian's son was admitted to middle school, but the father found out later than his neighbors.

The reason behind the "writer-snatching" incident lies in the county's efforts to promote mass cultural activities.

In recent years, farmers have enjoyed a better life, with no worries about food or clothing, but they lack cultural activities. The younger generation also enjoys performing on stage and entertaining themselves. The county, responding to public demand, started organizing cultural performances during the off-season in 1987, selecting outstanding performances to tour the countryside.

The first farmers' performance was attended by County Party Secretary Fu Tieshi. To his surprise, the usually sparsely attended professional performances were packed, with people even filling the aisles. The amateur cultural performance had such a strong appeal and influence, far beyond expectations. From then on, Fu Tieshi always made time to attend the performances.

Mass cultural activities became more vibrant each year. Last year's performances featured self-written and self-performed pieces reflecting local new people, new things, and new customs, which were highly praised by the audience and received county awards. This year, various townships saw the trend and wanted to focus on self-written and self-performed works. Thus, those who could write scripts, compose music, and direct in the county became the targets of competition. The "writer-snatching" incident was a highlight of this competition.

The "Shuangyang Zhang Duo" are well-known in Jilin's drama circle. Their plays have a earthy charm, and farmers love to watch them. Ten years ago, their Pingju opera "The Moon is Hard to Round" won the Ministry of Culture's award for outstanding rural-themed works, alongside films like "Joyful Gate" and "Laughter from Moon Bay."

Now, the plays the Zhang Duo write for amateur performances are all short plays, often rushed, but they never slack off, striving to make each play unique. When talking about this intense period of creation, the Zhang Duo couldn't hide their excitement and enthusiasm. "Writing for amateur performances, the audience appreciates us, and the officials respect us. In fact, we gain more from them."

In the past two years, the Zhang Duo have traveled through townships and villages, making many new friends, including farmers, workers, primary school teachers, demobilized soldiers, and grassroots cadres. They have touched the main melody of real life from these ordinary people, seen pure and noble souls, and been inspired to create.

Liu Zhufu, a female teacher from Xin'an Town, has dedicated her youth and energy to rural education for 17 years. Her husband is ill and unable to take care of himself, and she alone raises two children, bearing heavy mental and physical burdens. However, her class always ranks at the top in the town. To save a dropout student, Teacher Liu worked late into the night to persuade the parents. Once, on her way home, she fell into a puddle, returning home covered in mud, but her family hadn't even started cooking. Seeing her sick husband curled up on the kang and her primary school-aged child sleeping on the books, her heart ached. But the next day, when she entered the classroom and heard the children call out "Good morning, teacher!" all the hardships and fatigue were forgotten. She said, "The students are my greatest comfort." The Zhang Duo were moved by Liu Zhufu's dedication and wrote the one-act play "Nameless Grass" in a few days and nights. During the performance, the audience was deeply moved, and even tough men shed tears for the respected teacher.

The Zhang Duo frankly told the reporters, "Floating on the surface, many complaints reach your ears; sinking down, you see righteousness everywhere, and everywhere there are warm breezes. Our thoughts have been purified, and our creativity has been ignited."

　　新华社记者　范向群　周长庆
    吉林省会长春东南百里之遥，有个小县，名曰双阳。不久前那里曾发生过抢作家的新鲜事。记者闻讯急忙赶去了解事情的原委。
    被抢的是剧作家张福先和张惠文。二张出身于农民，正当盛年。由于二人经常合作写戏，人称“双阳二张”。他们向记者讲述了不久前被抢的经过。
    6月27日，石溪乡从会场把二张请走，让他们帮助写一部反映本乡巨变的地方戏《故土沧桑四十年》。他们正在石溪乡各村采访，县劳动局探到行踪，派车追到田头，不由分说拉回二张，“软禁”在招待所，不写完戏不放。二张失踪，石溪、奢岭等乡镇打电话四处寻找，长岭乡、新安镇通过“内线”找到招待所。二张分身无术。劳动局的戏写好，二人即去长岭搜集素材。两日后返回县城，奢岭乡趁机“劫”走。次日，二张被长岭乡抢回，藏进敬老院，二张突击三天，写出拉场戏《地为媒》和《歪打正着》。这时候，石溪乡得知他们赴长春开会，便派车等候，会议一结束，直接拉回石溪。二张在石溪三天两宿，7月29日凌晨完稿，奢岭来车接走，藏在幼儿园写戏，几日后写出二人转《瞧情郎》、拉场戏《礼尚往来》。8月10日，二张到新安镇，投入独幕话剧《无名草》和小品《家教》的创作。13至19日，二人穿梭于四乡镇之间，一边看彩排一边修改剧本。8月20日晚，二张在奢岭改戏，新安来电话追，奢岭不放，新安镇派人深夜驾车赶到奢岭来抢……
    整个夏天，二张被抢来抢去，忙得不亦乐乎，几过家门而不得入。张惠文风趣地说：“夏天过去了，家里的青苞米什么味都没尝到。”张福先的儿子考上了中学，当爸爸的比邻居知道得还晚。
    抢作家事出有因。县文化局的同志说，这件事要从县里开展群众性文化活动讲起。
    这些年，农民过上了抬头日子，不愁吃，不愁穿，缺的就是文化生活。年轻的一代还追求登台演出，自娱自乐。县里顺应民意，从1987年起农闲时节举办文艺汇演，选拔出来好节目下乡巡回演出。
    首届农民汇演，县委书记傅铁石被请来观赏。咦，怪哉！平日专业剧团演出，剧场里观众稀稀落落，今日却座无虚席，通道也挤满了人。业余文艺汇演对群众有这么大吸引力、感染力，出乎意料。从此，每逢汇演傅铁石总是挤时间到场观摩。
    群众性的文化活动一年比一年活跃。反映本乡本土新人新事新风貌的自编节目，去年汇演时倍受观众青睐，而且得到县里的嘉奖。今年，各乡镇看清了潮流，都想在自编自演上下功夫。于是，县内能编戏的、写词作曲的和导演，都成了争抢的对象。抢作家是这场争夺战的一段佳话。
    “双阳二张”在吉林省戏剧界颇有名气。他俩写的戏带有泥土的芬芳，农民很爱看，10年前创作的评剧《月难圆》，曾与电影《喜盈门》、《月亮湾的笑声》等一起荣获过文化部颁发的农村题材优秀创作奖。
    现在二张为业余文艺演出写的都是小戏，而且是急就章，但他们从不马虎，力求每出戏都各具风格。谈起这段紧张的创作生活，二张抑制不住内心的兴奋和激动。“给业余演出写戏，群众感激我们，干部礼遇我们，实际上我们从他们那里得到的东西更多。”
    这两年，二张走乡串镇，结识了不少新朋友，有农民、工人、小学教师、转业军人和基层干部。他们从这些普通人身上触摸到现实生活的主旋律，看到纯朴而高尚的灵魂，产生了强烈的创作欲望。
    新安镇女教师刘忠馥17年如一日，把青春和心血献给了农村的教育事业。丈夫患病，生活不能自理，她独自抚育两个孩子，肩负着沉重的精神压力和生活重担。但她教的班级一直在全镇拔尖，为了挽回一个流失生，刘老师连着几个晚上去做家长工作。一次路上掉进水坑，满身泥水回到家，家里还烟火未动。看见患病的丈夫蜷曲在炕上，上小学的孩子趴在书本上睡着了。她那颗贤妻慈母的心在饮泣颤抖。可是第二天走进教室，听孩子们喊一声“老师好！”什么苦啊累啊又都忘了。她说：“学生们是我的最大安慰。”二张被刘忠馥的奉献精神所打动，文思如泉涌，几个昼夜就拿出独幕话剧《无名草》。演出时台下观众无不动情，硬汉子也为可敬的人民教师洒下了热泪。
    二张对记者剖肺坦腑地说：“浮在上面，刮到耳朵里的很多是牢骚话；沉下去看，到处有正气，到处都有春风暖流。我们的思想得到了净化，创作有了激情。”
