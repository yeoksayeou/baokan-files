Since November 11, the civil war in El Salvador, a country in Central America, has escalated once again. Gunshots from the capital San Salvador and some provinces have cast a shadow over the peace of the region.

On the night of November 11, the guerrilla forces in El Salvador launched their largest military offensive in nearly 10 years in the capital region. They used heavy artillery to attack the police, army, and air force bases in the capital, as well as the presidential residence, while also launching attacks in other provinces. The government forces responded by sending planes to bomb areas controlled by the guerrillas and using heavy weapons to engage in combat. The Cristiani government declared a state of siege nationwide. According to reports, as of now, the government forces and guerrillas have suffered over a thousand casualties, and civilian casualties have also exceeded a thousand. Local diplomatic sources estimate that the 9-day battle has caused over $100 million in economic losses for El Salvador. On November 18, the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front announced that the guerrillas had shot down a government military aircraft in San Miguel City. The government spokesman neither confirmed nor denied this. The guerrillas' advance on the capital and the launch of such a powerful offensive, which has lasted for 10 days, have drawn attention. Moreover, the murder of six missionaries, including the rector of the Central American University in San Salvador, Eliacuria, by unidentified assailants during the fighting, has shocked international public opinion. Many countries and churches have condemned the incident. The United Nations Secretary-General has once again called on the warring parties to cease fire immediately.

By November 19, the fighting between the government forces and the guerrillas had significantly decreased. The Organization of American States, as well as some Latin American and European countries, are actively mediating to achieve a ceasefire and promote dialogue between the government and the guerrillas. The government forces and the guerrillas have agreed to have the church and the Organization of American States mediate. The Secretary-General of the Organization of American States, Suarez, has arrived in San Salvador to begin mediation.

Observers analyze that the guerrilla forces in El Salvador launched this large-scale military offensive for two main reasons: First, to demonstrate their strength through military action and force the government to engage in serious negotiations with the guerrillas. In September and October of this year, the government of El Salvador and the guerrillas held talks in Mexico and Costa Rica, respectively, but no agreement was reached. The Cristiani government adopted a delaying tactic in the negotiations, rejecting the guerrillas' reasonable demands to gain time to obtain more U.S. military aid. Second, the guerrillas intend to retaliate against the high-pressure policies and the rampant activities of the extreme right-wing forces implemented by the military government at home.

Years of civil strife in El Salvador have severely damaged the national economy, and various social contradictions are extremely sharp. The people yearn for peace and the reconstruction of the country, strongly calling for the government and the guerrillas to engage in dialogue to achieve domestic peace. Cristiani, who took office on June 1, claims to seek "dialogue" with the guerrillas, but under the support of the United States, he says he can only accept the "surrender" of the "rebel forces," not negotiations. This stance has resulted in the subsequent talks between the government and the guerrillas not achieving any results. Just as the government of El Salvador and the guerrillas began talks, the United States actually supported the military government of El Salvador in implementing a high-pressure policy at home. On November 10, the U.S. Congress also passed a resolution agreeing to provide $85 million in military aid to El Salvador next year to combat anti-government guerrillas. This undoubtedly adds fuel to the already volatile civil war situation. After the escalation of the civil war in El Salvador, the United States again expressed support for the Salvadoran government, attacking the guerrillas' offensive as a "desperate struggle." In addition, the United States publicly accused the Soviet Union and other countries of providing weapons to the Salvadoran guerrillas, announcing that Bush would discuss the issue of Central America with Gorbachev during their meeting at the beginning of next month. Obviously, the interference of external forces makes it more difficult and complex for El Salvador to achieve peace.

Latin American countries hope that the warring parties in El Salvador will turn their swords into plowshares, continue dialogue, and peacefully resolve conflicts. They also believe that external forces should be excluded, and the people of El Salvador should solve their own problems.

　　萨尔瓦多内战升级
　　管彦忠
    自本月11日以来，中美洲的萨尔瓦多内战再次升级。从首都圣萨尔瓦多及部分省区传出的枪声为中美洲地区的和平添上了阴影。
    11日夜，萨尔瓦多游击队在首都地区发动了近10年来最大的军事攻势，用猛烈炮火攻击驻首都的警察部队、陆军和空军基地以及总统官邸，同时在其他省也发动进攻。政府军出动飞机轰炸游击队占领的地区，使用重武器与游击队交战。克里斯蒂亚尼政府宣布全国实行戒严。据报道，迄今政府军和游击队已伤亡千余人，居民死伤者也逾千人。据当地外交人士估计，9天的战斗已使萨尔瓦多造成1亿多美元的经济损失。18日，法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线宣布，游击队在圣米格尔市击落政府军飞机一架，政府发言人既不证实也不否认。游击队兵逼首都，发起这样强大的攻势，坚持作战10日之久，引起了人们的注目。加之在战斗中，包括圣萨尔瓦多中美洲大学校长埃利亚库利亚在内的6名传教士被不明身份者谋杀，更引起国际舆论的震惊。许多国家和教会纷纷予以谴责。联合国秘书长也再次出面呼吁交战双方立即停火。
    到19日，政府军和游击队之间的战斗已明显减少。美洲国家组织、拉丁美洲和欧洲一些国家正积极斡旋，争取实现停火，促使政府和游击队恢复对话。政府军和游击队已同意由教会和美洲国家组织进行调解。美洲国家组织秘书长苏亚雷斯已赶到圣萨瓦尔多，开始调解。
    观察家们分析，萨尔瓦多游击队这次发动大规模军事攻势，主要有两方面的原因：一是通过军事行动显示自己的实力，以迫使政府同游击队进行认真的谈判。今年9、10月间，萨尔瓦多政府和游击队曾先后在墨西哥和哥斯达黎加进行过和谈，均未达成协议。克里斯蒂亚尼政府在谈判中采取拖延战术，拒绝了游击队提出的合理要求，以争取时间得到更多的美国军援。二是游击队意在对军政当局在国内实行的高压政策和极右势力的猖狂活动进行报复。
    萨尔瓦多连年战乱，国民经济受到严重破坏，各种社会矛盾十分尖锐。人民渴望和平，重建国家，强烈呼吁政府和游击队进行对话，以实现国内和平。今年6月1日就任的克里斯蒂亚尼总统虽宣称谋求与游击队“对话”，但他在美国的支持下，又说只能接受“反叛力量”的投降，而不是谈判。这一立场致使后来政府和游击队的几次和谈都没有获得成果。就在萨尔瓦多政府和游击队开始和谈以后，美国实际上支持萨尔瓦多军政当局在国内实行高压政策。11月10日，美国国会还通过决议，同意明年为萨尔瓦多提供8500万美元的军援，用于对付反政府游击队。这无疑给一触即发的内战形势火上添油。这次萨尔瓦多内战升级之后，美国又对萨尔瓦多政府表示支持，攻击游击队的进攻是“绝望挣扎”。此外美国还公开指责苏联等国为萨游击队提供武器，宣布布什下月初与戈尔巴乔夫会晤时，将讨论中美洲问题。显然，外部势力的干涉使萨尔瓦多实现和平更为艰难和复杂。
    拉美国家切望萨尔瓦多交战双方化干戈为玉帛，继续进行对话，和平解决冲突。它们同时认为，应当排除外部势力的插手，由萨尔瓦多人民自己解决自己的问题。
