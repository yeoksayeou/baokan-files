For a long time, Fang Lizhi and his associates have denied the Four Cardinal Principles, promoted bourgeois liberalization, deliberately obscured the essential differences between socialist democracy and capitalist democracy, and vigorously advocated Western bourgeois democracy among young students, confusing some people's thoughts. What kind of commodity is the "democratic" model of capitalism? Why must China adhere to the People's Congress system, the most fundamental political institution, and absolutely not adopt the "Western democracy" approach? This is a question that must be clarified by this day.

All bourgeois democratic republics (including constitutional monarchies) adopt parliamentary systems, which are the core of bourgeois democratic systems. Based on this, they also implement universal suffrage, a two-party or multi-party system, and a system of separation of powers. These forms constitute the entire "democratic" model that serves bourgeois private ownership. Under the influence of Fang Lizhi and others, some young people have expressed admiration for it, unaware that this formal equality masks actual inequality, and in essence, it is the dictatorship of a small number of bourgeois over the vast majority of working people.

Marxism believes that democracy should include two aspects: the content of democracy and the form of democracy. The content of democracy refers to the class nature of democracy, known as state democracy, which is about which classes in this country enjoy democracy. This is the most essential aspect of democracy. Socialist democracy is based on the public ownership of the means of production and is enjoyed by the vast majority of working people; capitalist democracy is based on the private ownership of the means of production and is enjoyed by a small number of capitalists. This is the fundamental difference between the two types of social democracy. As for the form of democracy, it is the external structure of democratic content, known as political democracy or state democracy. The form of democracy has greater variability and selectivity, and the key is to start from the national conditions. We measure the superiority of socialist and capitalist democracies, and the most important thing is to focus on the content of democracy, rather than just looking at the form one-sidedly. Of course, some good things in the legal construction of capitalist democracy can also be learned by socialism. But generally speaking, content is the essence, and form serves the content. It is absolutely not acceptable to blindly copy the entire "Western democracy" approach.

Fang Lizhi, in order to change the fundamental content and nature of socialist democracy, has made a big deal out of the "form." They seize on the imperfect aspects of the form of socialist democracy, arbitrarily exaggerate the influence of some feudalistic ideas in real life, and use bourgeois "freedom" and "democracy" as weapons to whip them. They slander our current system as "feudalism painted with socialist colors," inciting some students to "independently" from the government and "attack society" to seek Western-style "democracy." It should be known that Fang Lizhi and others' "anti-feudalism" is false, and their real target is socialism. Their goal is to attempt to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party of China and overthrow the socialist system.

Fang Lizhi and others compare our People's Congress with Western parliaments, praising the mutual arguments and free debates in Western parliaments, and using this to judge that "Chinese democracy is not as good as Western democracy."

What kind of democracy is the Western parliamentary system? Let's first look at its class essence.

The capitalist parliamentary system, in form, is a system where citizens vote to elect representatives to form the highest organ of state power, the parliament (Congress). Therefore, the parliament has always been praised by the bourgeoisie as an organ representing the will of the people. We do not discuss whether it is truly the highest organ of state power, but only whether it truly represents the will of the people. The political system of a country is determined by its state system. The bourgeois parliament is controlled by the bourgeoisie, and the working people cannot enter the parliament. How can it be an "organ representing the will of the people"?

The members of the U.S. Congress (composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives) have basically been capitalists or lawyers serving capitalists and other upper-class figures. Just looking at the members of the 95th U.S. Congress, there are 531 members in the Senate and the House of Representatives, including 95 businessmen and financiers, 20 farmers and ranchers, 22 government officials, 277 lawyers, 80 educators, journalists, and doctors, and 37 others. There is not a single representative of workers or agricultural workers. The 12% of the U.S. population that is black has no representatives in the Senate. The British Parliament is composed of the King, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons. The King is a hereditary monarch; the members of the House of Lords are nobles; only the members of the House of Commons are elected, but this is also done under the guarantee of bourgeois rule. In the House of Commons from 1971 to 1972, there were 627 members from the Conservative Party, the Labour Party, and the Liberal Party, including 275 who were also chairmen of large companies, 57 who were directors, 194 who were managers, and 101 who were senior lawyers; they owned a total of 375,100 acres of land. These people do not represent the interests and will of the proletariat and the broad masses of the people. As Lenin pointed out in "The State and Revolution": "Every few years, it is decided which person in the ruling class will oppress the people in the parliament, which is the true essence of bourgeois parliamentary democracy." (Lenin Selected Works, Vol. 3, p. 209)

Such a bourgeois parliament cannot be compared with our People's Congress. Our People's Congress is not only the true highest organ of state power but also truly represents the will of the people. For example, the 7th National People's Congress of China has 2,970 representatives, including 684 workers and peasants, accounting for 23% of the total number of representatives; 697 intellectuals, accounting for 23.4%; 733 cadres, accounting for 24.7%; 267 military personnel, accounting for 9%; and 49 returned overseas Chinese, accounting for 1.6%. Among all the representatives, there are 1,986 members of the Communist Party, accounting for 66.8% of the total number of representatives, and 984 non-Communist Party members, accounting for 33.2%. There are 445 representatives from ethnic minorities, accounting for 15% of the total number of representatives. This fully reflects the essence of our people being the masters of the country.

As for the "mutual arguments and heated debates" in Western parliaments, they are manifestations of the bourgeoisie's internal struggles and mutual betrayals. Representatives represent the interests of different financial groups and must argue and debate with each other, which is the fundamental reason why they cannot reach a "unanimous passage" on many occasions. While our people's representatives, although they represent the different interests of various strata of people and different interest groups, have a unified fundamental goal. Under this premise, many different interests and demands can be solved through democratic consultation. In fact, our People's Congress also has debates and criticisms, and many documents are passed after repeated discussions and revisions. Here, it should be emphasized that when comparing the superiority of the two democracies, we should not just look at whether there are arguments or unanimous passages in the meetings, but rather look at whether the decisions made represent the interests of the majority or the interests of the minority.

(2)

Fang Lizhi and others, under the banner of "democracy," vigorously advocate the two-party or multi-party system of the West, which, in essence, is an attempt to make the Communist Party step down and abolish the leadership of the Communist Party in China.

The so-called capitalist two-party system refers to some capitalist countries where two major parties (or more than two parties in a multi-party system) representing the interests of the bourgeoisie take turns organizing the government and ruling in turn, implementing bourgeois rule.

From 1875 to the present, the United States has been ruled by two major parties representing the interests of the monopoly bourgeoisie, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, taking turns in power. In terms of organizational form and main activities, the organizational structures of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party are roughly the same, with no fixed members, no fixed platforms, no membership procedures, and no membership dues. As long as voters register and declare their affiliation with a party, they can be considered members of that party. The main activities of the two parties in the United States are to organize elections, through parliamentary elections every few years and presidential elections every four years, to conduct "party elections." The winning party takes office as the ruling party, and the losing party is called the opposition party, or the opposition. If the ruling party makes mistakes in its administration, the opposition party will strongly criticize it, and at the same time, it will also take the opportunity to propose some proposals that cater to the wishes of the masses, thus creating a false appearance of political democracy. In reality, the two-party system is a reflection of the internal contradictions and interests of the bourgeoisie in politics and a means for the bourgeoisie to deceive the masses. Because the backers of the two major parties are monopolistic capitalists, and monopolistic capitalists often support both parties. They invest in the candidates of both parties. Some monopolistic financial groups support the Republican Party in one period and the Democratic Party in another, all for the purpose of ensuring that the person most suitable for their needs comes to power from their own interests. During the 1960 election, Rockefeller, as a powerful figure in the Republican Party, supported Kennedy, a Democrat, to run for president. Eisenhower was originally a military man and not a member of either party. During the election, he received support from Rockefeller and the Morgan financial group and was elected as the Republican candidate. The facts show that no matter which party of the bourgeoisie is in power, they are all political agents of monopolistic capitalists, implementing bourgeois dictatorship and safeguarding the interests of the bourgeoisie. If we talk about democracy, the two-party system is only the democracy within the bourgeoisie, and for the broad masses of the people, it is just a big deception. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "This so-called two-party system is just a method to maintain bourgeois dictatorship and cannot guarantee the freedom and rights of the working people." (Mao Zedong Selected Works, Vol. 5, p. 367)

If, as advocated by Fang Lizhi and others, China were to adopt a multi-party system with parties taking turns in power, it would fundamentally negate the interests of the vast majority of the people. Because our country adheres to the leadership of the Communist Party, which is a historical choice. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people, after thousands of hardships and struggles, finally established New China. After our party took power, it united the forces of all sectors of the country, ended China's fragmented situation, and began a magnificent socialist revolution and construction. Especially in the 10 years after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, we implemented reforms and opening up and achieved great achievements that attracted worldwide attention. If it were not for the leadership of the Communist Party, could the Chinese people have today's achievements? Indeed, our party has made serious mistakes, but these mistakes have all been corrected by the party itself, not by other forces. History has proven that the Communist Party of China is the core force leading the Chinese people. Fang Lizhi and others advocate "taking turns in power," making the Communist Party step down, which is to make China "flow" back to division and chaos, making the interests of the broad masses of the people "flow" to a small number of the bourgeoisie.

Adhering to the leadership of the Communist Party is completely consistent with promoting socialist democracy. In the eyes of Fang Lizhi and others, adhering to the one-party leadership of the Communist Party is "dictatorship" and "autocracy." This is a great slander. In terms of party-state relations, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly proposed the theory of separating party and government. Under the guidance of this theory, our country is reforming the party's governance system and governance methods. In terms of the relationship between our party and other democratic parties, we have created and accumulated valuable experience in the cooperative governance of the Communist Party of China over the past few decades. Our multi-party cooperation system, on the one hand, implements one-party leadership, which can overcome the weaknesses of party competition in the Western multi-party system; on the other hand, it implements the coexistence and cooperation of multiple parties, playing the strengths of mutual supervision and mutual restraint between parties, to avoid possible deviations in the process of one-party governance. Under the conditions of socialism in our country, whether it is the Communist Party or other democratic parties, they all represent the interests of the working people, and the great goal of realizing the modernization of Chinese socialism is consistent. Therefore, all democratic parties unanimously support the leadership of the Communist Party, and the Communist Party of China sincerely welcomes all democratic parties to participate in the government and participate in state administration. The Political Consultative Conference and the political consultation system are unique forms of our party to play the role of various democratic parties, which is a supplement to the form of democracy. The fact that our party has coexisted with several other parties for a long time, supervised each other, shared joys and sorrows, and shared weal and woe is something that Fang Lizhi and others cannot deny, and the close relationship between our party and the democratic parties is something that Fang Lizhi and others cannot sow discord and destroy.

(3)

The capitalist democratic form also has a so-called "separation of powers." Fang Lizhi said: "This is what democratization should achieve," "a democratic society is a multi-element restraint, and a single-element rule will inevitably lead to dictatorship and autocracy." This trick is easy to deceive people.

The so-called "separation of powers" is a bourgeois democratic theory that divides national power into legislative, administrative, and judicial powers and sets up three government agencies to restrain each other. This was formally proposed by the French bourgeois enlightenment thinker Montesquieu in the 18th century. At that time, he advocated that the parliament exercise legislative power, the monarch hold administrative power, and the courts handle judicial power, attempting to use the bourgeois-controlled parliament to limit the administrative agencies still in the hands of feudal forces, so that the bourgeoisie could gain political advantage. This represented the interests and demands of the rising bourgeoisie in their struggle against feudal autocracy to implement "class separation of powers," which had a certain historical role. However, after the bourgeoisie came to power, the nature of this "class separation of powers" changed, and this separation of powers was actually just a division of labor within the bourgeois state organs. Especially in contemporary times, due to the awakening of the proletariat and the changes in objective conditions, the bourgeoisie, in order to maintain their rule, have changed the original face of the separation of powers theory, and some important principles have been destroyed, becoming incomplete things. In fact, Western countries are not all implementing this tripartite separation of powers system. Even in the United States, which is considered the most typical of "separation of powers," the principle of mutual restraint of separation of powers no longer plays a significant role, and the manipulator of the entire government is still the monopolistic capitalist.

In the United States, when Congress and the President have conflicts, Congress generally still follows the President's will. The President, through the control of legislative initiative and the manipulation of legislative procedures, has actually taken away most of Congress's legislative power. The President's annual State of the Union Address, budget report, and special reports to Congress are actually the content and basis of the President's request for Congress to legislate. In this way, Congress finds it difficult to supervise the government on substantive issues. They are subordinate to the government, and the government is manipulated by monopolistic financial groups. The true rulers are not the President but some major financial groups. The Presidents of the United States have all been representatives of financial groups. It can be seen that the form of "separation of powers" in the United States has no practical significance and can only give people a false appearance of "democracy."

We do not oppose other countries implementing "separation of powers," but we do not adopt the bourgeois "separation of powers" approach. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "We implement the system of the National People's Congress with one house, which is most in line with China's reality. If the policy is correct and the direction is correct, this system has great benefits and is very helpful for the prosperity and development of the country, avoiding many distractions. Of course, if the policy is wrong, no matter what system you have, it is of no use." In our socialist country, the fundamental interests of all the people are consistent, and it is possible and necessary for the People's Congress, which represents the interests and will of the people, to unify the exercise of state power. On this premise, the administrative power, judicial power, and other powers of the state are also clearly divided, so that the state power organs and administrative, judicial, and other organs can work in coordination to effectively lead and organize the cause of socialist construction, thereby ensuring that all the people can better exercise state power. Our People's Congress is the organ of state power. The National People's Congress is the highest organ of state power, which is elected democratically, is responsible to the people, and is supervised by the people. It and its Standing Committee jointly exercise state legislative power. The administrative organs at all levels of the state are produced and decided by the corresponding state power organs at all levels. They are not only administrative management organs of the state but also executive organs of the state power organs. They must be responsible to the power organs and report their work, accept supervision, and cannot be on an equal footing with them. The judicial organs of our country mainly include public security, procuratorates, and courts. Public security organs are under the jurisdiction of state administrative departments. The people's courts at all levels, as state judicial organs, and the people's procuratorates at all levels, as legal supervision organs, are established by the corresponding state power organs at all levels and are responsible to the state power organs that produce them. The courts independently exercise judicial power. A strict procuratorial system is a unique national system and legal phenomenon of a socialist country. These are all established on the basis of democratic centralism, with Chinese characteristics, and are socialist democratic political systems. Practice has proven that our system is based on China's actual situation, while Fang Lizhi and others want to copy the system of Western countries, which is simply to change our socialist system.

Of course, our socialist democratic politics need a process of self-improvement, and achieving the goal of high-level socialist democracy also requires a great deal of development. However, we must not change the direction of people's democratic dictatorship and must not change the fundamental political system of the People's Congress. On this premise, through the joint efforts of the whole party and the people of the whole country, the construction of socialist democratic politics in our country will definitely be raised to a new level.

    析方励之鼓吹的“西方民主”
    余敏
    长期以来，方励之及其同伙否定四项基本原则，大搞资产阶级自由化，故意抹杀社会主义民主和资本主义民主的本质区别，在青年学生中极力鼓吹西方资产阶级的民主，把一些人的思想搞乱了。到底资本主义的一套“民主”模式是个什么货色？为什么在中国必须坚持人民代表大会这个最根本的政治制度而绝不能实行“西方民主”那一套？这是时至今日非搞清不可的问题。
    凡资产阶级民主共和国（含君主立宪国），都采用议会制形式，这是资产阶级民主制的核心。以此为中心，他们还实行普选制、两党制或多党制、三权分立制。这些形式，构成了为资产阶级私有制服务的整个“民主”模式。在方励之等人的鼓吹下，有的青年人对它表示欣赏，他们不知道这种形式上的平等掩盖着事实上的不平等，实质是实行资产阶级少数人对绝大多数劳动人民的专政。
    马克思主义认为，民主应该包括两个方面：民主的内容和民主的形式。所谓民主的内容，是指民主的阶级属性，叫国体民主，就是在这个国家由哪些阶级享受民主。这是民主最本质的东西。社会主义民主建立在生产资料公有制基础上，是绝大多数劳动人民享有的民主；而资本主义民主建立在生产资料私有制基础之上，是少数资本家享有的民主。这是两种不同社会民主的根本区别。至于民主的形式，则是民主内容的外在结构，叫民主体制或政体民主。民主形式具有较大的可变性和选择性，关键是要从本国的国情出发。我们衡量社会主义和资本主义两种民主的优劣，最重要的是应该着眼于民主的内容，而不能片面地只看形式，当然，资本主义民主形式的某些东西，尤其法制建设上有些好的东西，社会主义也可以借鉴。但一般说来，内容是本质，而形式是为内容服务的，全盘照搬“西方民主”那一套，是绝对不行的。
    方励之为了改变社会主义民主的根本内容和性质，在“形式”上大做文章。他们抓住社会主义民主形式某些不完善的地方，任意夸大现实生活中存在的一些封建主义思想残余的影响，再用资产阶级的“自由”“民主”作武器加以鞭笞。他们污蔑我国现行的制度是“抹上社会主义油彩的封建主义”，煽动一些学生“独立于政府”、“冲击社会”，以争取西方那一套所谓的“民主”。要知道，方励之等人“反封建”是假，反社会主义是真，其目的就是妄图取消中国共产党的领导，推翻社会主义制度。
    （一）
    方励之等人拿我国的人民代表大会和西方国家的议会作比较，吹捧西方议会里可以互相争吵、自由辩论，以此作出判断，说“中国的民主不如西方的民主”。
    西方议会制是一种什么样的民主？让我们先看看它的阶级实质吧。
    资本主义议会制，在形式上是公民投票选举议员，组成资产阶级国家的最高权力机关即议会（国会）。因此，议会历来被资产阶级吹嘘为代表民意的机关。我们先且不论它究竟是否真正的最高权力机关，只谈它是否真正代表民意。一个国家的政体是由国体决定的，资产阶级的议会由资产阶级所把持，劳动人民不能进入议会，它怎么可能是“代表民意的机关”呢？
    美国历届国会（由参议院和众议院组成）的议员，基本上都是资本家或为资本家服务的律师等上层人物。仅从美国第95届国会的成员来看，参、众两院共有议员531人，其中企业主、金融家95人，农场主、牧场主20人，政府官员22人，律师277人，教育新闻界人士和医生80人，其他37人，没有一名工人或农业工人的代表。占美国人口12％的黑人在参议院中也没有一名代表。英国的议会是由国王、上议院和下议院组成。其中，国王是世袭制；上议院议员由贵族担任；唯下议院议员经选举产生，但这也要在确保资产阶级统治下进行。在1971年至1972年下议院的议员中，保守党、工党和自由党共有议员627名，其中身兼大公司董事长的275人，当董事的57人，当经理的194人，高级律师101人；他们拥有土地共达375100英亩，这些人根本不代表无产阶级和广大人民群众的利益和意志。正如列宁在《国家与革命》中指出的：“每隔几年决定一次究竟由统治阶级中的什么人在议会里镇压人民、压迫人民，——这就是资产阶级议会制的真正本质。”（《列宁选集》第3卷，第209页）
    这种资产阶级的议会，是不能与我国人民代表大会相比的。我国的人民代表大会，不仅是国家真正的最高权力机关，而且是真正代表民意的。如我国第七届全国人民代表大会共有代表2970名，其中工农684名，占代表总数的23％；知识分子697名，占23.4％；干部733名，占24.7％；解放军267名，占9％；归国华侨49名，占1.6％。在整个代表中，中共党员1986名，占代表总数66.8％，非中共党员984名，占33.2％。少数民族代表445名，占代表总数的15％。这充分反映了我国人民当家作主的本质。
    至于西方议会里“互相争吵、激烈辩论”，那是资产阶级内部互相倾轧、尔虞我诈的表现。议员们代表不同财团的利益，必然要互相争吵辩论，这是他们在许多情况下对议案不可能出现“一致通过”现象的根本原因。而我国的人民代表，尽管也代表着各阶层人民的不同利益和不同利益集团的不同要求，但根本目标是一致的。在这个前提下，许多不同的利益和要求可以通过民主协商的途径解决。其实，我国人民代表大会也有争论和批评，不少文件也是经过反复讨论、修改后才通过的。这里应该着重指出的是，在比较两种民主的优劣时，不能光看会议上有无争吵，有无不一致通过的情况，而要看作出的决定是代表多数人的利益，还是代表少数人的利益。
    （二）
    方励之等人打着“民主”的旗号，极力鼓吹西方的两党制或多党制，说穿了，他们是妄想共产党下台，在中国取消共产党的领导。
    所谓资本主义的两党制，是指一些资本主义国家，由代表资产阶级利益的两大政党（两个以上系多党制）交替组织政府，轮流执政，实行资产阶级统治的制度。
    美国从1875年到现在，都是由代表垄断资产阶级利益的两大政党，即民主党和共和党轮流执政的。从组织形式和主要活动来看，民主党和共和党的组织机构大体相同，都没有固定的党员，也没有固定的政纲，既没有入党手续，也不交纳党费，只要选民登记时声明属于哪个政党，便可作为该党的党员。美国两党的主要活动都是组织竞选，通过几年一次的议会和四年一次的总统选举，进行“政党竞选”，竞选获胜的党上台，成为执政党，失败的党叫在野党，即反对党。如果执政党在施政中出现什么漏子，反对党就大肆抨击，同时也乘机提出一些迎合群众意愿的主张，这就造成一种政治民主的假象，实际上两党制是资产阶级内部矛盾和利益在政治上的反映，是资产阶级欺骗群众的一种手段。因为两大政党的后台老板都是垄断资本家，而垄断资本家往往同时支持两个政党。在两个党的候选人身上下本钱。也有些垄断财团在某个时期支持共和党，另一时期支持民主党，目的都是为了从自身的利益出发，以保证最适合他们需要的人上台。1960年大选时，洛克菲勒作为共和党内有势力的领导人物，却支持民主党的肯尼迪竞选总统。艾森豪威尔原本是个军人，不是两党的党员，在竞选时他得到洛克菲勒、摩根财团的支持，因而作为共和党的候选人当选。事实表明，无论资产阶级的哪个党执政，他们都是垄断资本家的政治代理人，实行的都是资产阶级专政，维护的都是资产阶级的利益。如果谈民主，两党制只不过是资产阶级内部的民主，对广大人民来说只是一个大骗局。正如毛泽东同志所说：“这种所谓两党制不过是维护资产阶级专政的一种方法，它绝不能保障劳动人民的自由权利。”（《毛泽东选集》第5卷，第367页）
    如果像方励之等人鼓吹的那样，在中国搞多党轮流执政，就从根本上否定了绝大多数人民的利益。因为我国坚持共产党的领导，是历史的选择。在共产党的领导下，中国人民经过千难万苦的奋斗，终于建立了新中国。在我们党执政以后，团结了全国各方面的力量，结束了中国四分五裂的局面，开始了轰轰烈烈的社会主义革命和建设。尤其党的十一届三中全会后的这10年，实行改革、开放，取得了举世瞩目的伟大成就。不是共产党的领导，能有中国人民的今天吗？诚然，我们党也犯过严重错误，但错误都是我们党自己纠正的，不是别的力量来纠正的。历史证明，中国共产党是唯一领导中国人民的核心力量。方励之等人鼓吹“轮流执政”，让共产党下台，就是要使中国“流”退到分裂和混乱，使广大人民群众的利益“流”让给少数资产阶级。
    坚持共产党的领导同发扬社会主义民主是完全统一的。在方励之等人来说，坚持共产党的一党领导，就是“独裁”、“专制”。这是极大的污蔑。从党政关系来说，邓小平同志明确提出了党政分开的理论，在这一理论指导下，我国正在改革党的执政体制和执政方式。从我们党和其他民主党派的关系来说，几十年来，我们已经创造并积累了中国共产党领导的多党合作的宝贵经验。我们这种多党合作制，一方面实行一党领导，可以克服西方多党制中政党竞争的弱点；另一方面又实行多党共存合作，发挥政党间互相监督、互相制约的长处，以免一党执政过程中可能出现的偏差。在我国社会主义条件下，无论共产党还是各民主党派，都是代表劳动人民利益的，实现我国社会主义现代化的大目标是一致的。因此，各民主党派一致拥护共产党的领导，中国共产党也诚心诚意欢迎各民主党派参与政权，参加国家管理。政治协商会议，政治协商制度，就是我们党特有的一种发挥各民主党派作用的形式，是对民主形式的一种补充。我们党同其他几个党派长期共存，互相监督，肝胆相照，荣辱与共的事实，是方励之等人否定不了的，我们党同民主党派的亲密关系，也是方励之等人挑拨破坏不了的。
    （三）
    资本主义民主形式还有一个所谓“三权分立制”。方励之说：“这是民主化应当做到的”、“民主社会是多元制约的，单元的统治必然会造成独裁、专制。”这一招也容易迷惑人。
    所谓“三权分立”，是资产阶级民主制把国家权力分为立法、行政、司法三个部分，并相应设立三个政府机构以互相制约的一种分权学说，这是18世纪法国资产阶级启蒙思想家孟德斯鸠正式明确提出来的。他当时主张，由议会行使立法权，君主掌握行政权，法院专管司法权，企图用资产阶级控制的议会来限制还在封建势力手中的行政机关的权力，使资产阶级获得政治优势。这代表了当时新兴资产阶级在反封建专制斗争中，向封建地主阶级实行“阶级分权”的利益和要求，具有一定的历史作用。但是，当资产阶级取得统治以后，这种“阶级分权”的性质起了变化，这种分权实际上只是资产阶级国家机关内部的一种分工。特别是在当代，由于无产阶级的觉醒和客观形势的变化，资产阶级为了维护他们的统治，已经改变了分权学说的本来面目，一些重要原则也遭到了破坏，变成了残缺不全的东西。实际上，现在西方国家也并不都是实行这种三权鼎立式的制度，即使在公认为“三权分立”最典型的美国，这种分权鼎立的互相制约的原则已不起多大作用，整个政权的操纵者还是垄断资本家。
    在美国，当国会与总统发生矛盾时，一般还是国会服从总统意旨。总统通过对立法创议权的控制，以及对立法程序的操纵，实际上夺走了国会的大部分立法权。总统每年向国会提出的国情咨文、预算咨文、特别咨文，实际上就是总统要求国会立法的内容和依据。这样一来，议会很难就实质性问题对政府实施监督。他们是议会从属于政府，政府被垄断财团所操纵。真正的统治者不是总统，而是一些主要财团。美国历届的总统，都只是财团的代表。可见，美国“三权分立”的形式，并没有什么实际意义，只能从表面上给人一种“民主”的假象。
    我们并不反对别国实行“三权分立”，但我们不搬用资产阶级“三权分立”那一套。邓小平同志指出：“我们实行的就是全国人民代表大会一院制，这最符合中国实际。如果政策正确，方向正确，这种体制益处很大，很有助于国家的兴旺发达，避免很多牵扯。当然，如果政策搞错了，不管你什么院制也没有用。”在我们的社会主义国家，形成了全体人民根本利益的一致，可以而且必须由代表人民利益和意志的人民代表大会统一行使国家权力。同时在这个前提下，对于国家的行政权、司法权等，也都有明确的划分，使国家权力机关和行政、司法等机关能够协调一致地工作，有效地领导和组织社会主义建设事业，从而保证全体人民更好地行使国家权力。我国的人民代表大会，是国家的权力机关。全国人大是最高国家权力机关，它由民主选举产生，对人民负责，受人民监督，由全国人大和它的常委会共同行使国家立法权。国家各级行政机关由相应的各级国家权力机关产生、决定，它不仅是国家的行政管理机关，而且是国家权力机关的执行机关，它要对权力机关负责并报告工作，接受监督，不能与之分庭抗礼。我国的司法机关，主要包括公安、检察、法院等机关。公安机关由国家行政部门管辖。作为国家审判机关的各级人民法院和作为法律监督机关的各级人民检察院，由相应的各级国家权力机关组建，并对产生它的国家权力机关负责，法院独立行使判审权。严整的检察机构是社会主义国家特有的国家制度和法律现象。这些都是从我国国情出发，在民主集中制基础上建立的具有中国特色
  的社会主义民主政治制度。实践证明，我国的这一套制度，是从我国的实际情况出发，而方励之等人要照搬西方国家的那一套东西，无非就是要改变我们的社会主义制度。
      当然，我们社会主义民主政治需要有一个自我完善的过程，实现高度的社会主义民主目标也还需要有一个很大的发展。但是，我们坚持人民民主专政的方向不能变，坚持实行人民代表大会的根本政治制度不能变。在这个前提下，经过全党全国人民的共同努力，我国社会主义民主政治的建设一定会提高到一个新水平。
