    **For a Better Tomorrow: The Environmental Pollution Control in Benxi City**

    **People's Daily, November 11, 1989, 5th Edition (Domestic Page - Science and Education)**

    **By People's Daily Reporter Xie Lianhui**

    Between 123 degrees 34 minutes and 125 degrees 46 minutes east longitude, and 40 degrees 49 minutes and 41 degrees 35 minutes north latitude, on satellite images, there is an indistinct eastern city—this is Benxi City in China, shrouded in industrial pollution.

    In 1989, on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, State Councilor Song Jian, the State Council's Environmental Protection Committee, relevant national ministries, and responsible officials from Liaoning Province came here to hold the "Benxi Pollution Control Field Office Meeting." This city, known for having the most severe air pollution in the country, was about to change its appearance.

    **Zhao Zhenyu's "Nail Spirit"**

    On September 23, the reporter conversed with the people of Benxi:
    "The central government is very concerned about Benxi's pollution. What are your thoughts on controlling pollution?"
    "Controlling pollution? Just to make it cleaner? We welcome that. What else do you have in mind?!"

    A person from Benxi in their forties, accompanying the reporter, felt embarrassed upon hearing his father's casual response. How could one say that "controlling pollution" is just about "making it cleaner"?

    Zhao Zhenyu, who had served as the director of Benxi City's Environmental Protection Bureau for six consecutive years, took the reporter's hand and said: I just don't believe that Benxi people, who have built a highly modernized raw material industrial base with their own hands and created first-class products, cannot control pollution and create a clean, hygienic, and civilized environment.

    According to a comrade from the State Environmental Protection Bureau, Zhao Zhenyu and his colleagues have a "nail spirit." They took the initiative to go to Beijing, persistently reporting to various bureau chiefs and department heads, and repeatedly introducing the situation to reporters from news agencies:
    Benxi City has 33 major smoke plumes, releasing 94.7 billion cubic meters of waste gas into the sky annually. The city's air visibility is around 50 meters for half the year. The monthly dustfall per square kilometer is 53 tons, exceeding the national standard by 6.2 times; among the city's five major rivers, three are severely polluted. The Taizi River, which flows through the city, discharges over 200 million tons of wastewater annually, with each liter containing 60 times the standard amount of phenol and 16 times the standard amount of oil, making it nearly impossible for fish and shrimp to survive; the city produces 12.76 million tons of waste annually, with a cumulative amount of 150 million tons over the years, occupying 9.27 million square meters of land...

    This elderly director with a wrinkled face earnestly said: "I only ask you to do two things for Benxi: first, come to our city and see the situation with your own eyes, then report it to the central government; second, appeal to society to raise people's environmental awareness."

    When the mayor introduced this 61-year-old director to the reporter, he was deeply moved. Everyone in Benxi knows about Director Zhao. Under his and his colleagues' advocacy, Benxi people established a rule: "Whoever can control Benxi's environmental pollution has the right to be the mayor of Benxi City." Since the state promulgated the "Environmental Protection Law" in 1979, under the inspiration of the "nail spirit" of the comrades from the municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, the city has invested 140 million yuan to build over 200 environmental protection facilities; from 1981 to 1986, the city collected 68.47 million yuan in pollution fees, accounting for 4.2‰ of the industrial output value, which is 3.5 times the national average; from 1983 to 1987, the city's investment in pollution prevention and control accounted for 8% of the total investment in fixed assets, which is double the national average; during the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period, the investment in environmental protection was 173 million yuan, accounting for 3.33% of the city's national income, which is about 5 times the national average during the same period. Zhao Zhenyu became a meritorious official in Benxi.

    **One Hundred Days of Strategic Planning**

    In April 1987, the State Environmental Protection Bureau organized experts to conduct a special investigation and research in Benxi;
    In January 1988, the State Council's Environmental Protection Committee organized relevant departments from the central government and Liaoning Province to conduct a joint investigation in Benxi, studying the city's pollution control targets and funding sources;
    In August 1988, after seeing the severe pollution situation in Benxi and other places, Comrade Chen Yun and central leaders made important instructions one after another.

    Controlling Benxi's industrial pollution is an experiment of great significance. The State Council's Environmental Protection Committee became the center for researching and strategizing this experiment. They initially treated Benxi City as a complex regional urban ecosystem for study, dispatching a deputy director from the State Environmental Protection Bureau to assist Benxi City in strategic planning and providing timely and accurate information.

    To reverse the deteriorating trend of the ecological environment here, to ensure that the air quality does not fall below the national third-level standard and the water quality does not fall below the fifth-level standard, how many control projects are needed, how many years of control, and how much investment?

    —The feedback from Benxi is: For Benxi, which consumes 700 million tons of coal annually, at least the already formed "black dragons," "yellow dragons," and "gray dragons" must be subdued, and 37 sewage outlets must be controlled. Roughly estimated, at least 56 key control projects are needed, with an investment of nearly 388.9 million yuan, and it will take 7 years to see results.

    According to the principle of "who pollutes, who controls," how much funding can each industrial enterprise raise?

    —The feedback from Benxi is: Among the city's 1,133 industrial enterprises, counting one by one, including pollution fee special funds, equipment modification funds, comprehensive profit retention, urban maintenance fees, etc., only 1.6 billion yuan can be solved.

    The Liaoning Provincial Government decided to allocate 40 million yuan for Benxi's environmental control.

    —The funding gap is still significant.

    Premier Li Peng and Vice Premier Yao Yilin listened to Song Jian's reports multiple times, showing great concern for this experiment; officials from the General Office of the State Council and the Secretariat, at the request of Song Jian, repeatedly sought help from relevant ministries and commissions for Benxi.

    People understood Benxi. This heavy industrial raw material base, which developed gradually in modern times, now provides the country with 3.56 million tons of iron, 2.3 million tons of steel, 2 million tons of coal, and 2 million tons of cement annually. Over the past 40 years, it has cumulatively produced 250 million tons of industrial raw materials such as pig iron, steel, raw coal, and cement. They sent first-class industrial products and important raw materials to others, transporting them to where the country needs them, while leaving the waste and pollution to themselves.

    People were moved. The State Bureau of Building Materials was the first to raise funds to control pollution for its two cement plants in Benxi. After 100 days of intense coordination and planning, on December 29, 1988, the 14th meeting of the State Council's Environmental Protection Committee approved the "Decision on Controlling Environmental Pollution in Benxi City," which was quickly approved by Premier Li Peng.

    **An Unusual Field Office Meeting**

    On September 21, State Councilor and Chairman of the State Council's Environmental Protection Committee Song Jian, Vice Secretary of the State Council Wang Shuming, and Vice Chairmen of the Environmental Protection Committee Li Xucuo and Qu Geping, along with nearly 20 departments from the central government and the province, led by Liaoning Province Governor Li Changchun and Vice Governor Wen Shizhen, came to Benxi for a "field office meeting."

    On the second morning of their arrival in Benxi, the participants in the meeting climbed a 240-meter-high city park hill to overlook the inversion layer and the city area above the city. Zhao Zhenyu reported to Song Jian, saying that this is a river valley basin, with factory areas, commercial areas, and residential areas all mixed together. The smoke from the factory chimneys cannot disperse in the valley, greatly affecting the citizens, and the overall layout of the city is like "putting a toilet on the dining table," which is very unreasonable and difficult to control.

    After hearing the report, Song Jian said that the construction layout of Benxi is caused by many historical reasons, and it seems difficult to completely change it now. For such heavily polluted heavy industrial cities, it is very important to strengthen the public's environmental awareness. He pointed to the governor and mayor beside him and said that the leaders' environmental awareness is even more important. Everyone should care for and protect the environment in which they live.

    At this moment, Governor Li Changchun pulled Benxi Steel General Manager Zhang Wendang aside and asked, "Which factory are those two smoking chimneys in front?" Manager Zhang replied that they belong to the Benxi Steel Power Plant. The governor asked, "Can you control them during your term?"

    Zhang Wendang promised to control these two "black dragons" by 1992.

    "Good!" Li Changchun said to the surrounding reporters, "I hope you can report Manager Zhang's words and let everyone check on it when the time comes."

    Along the way, everyone observed the dust collection effect of the electrostatic precipitator designed by the Benxi Steel Design Institute for the power plant and inspected some key pollution sources along the way. Governor Li Changchun found Mayor Yu Guopan and, after inquiring about the production and environmental control of severely polluted enterprises, suggested that Benxi might establish such a rule: any enterprise or factory with severe pollution, if there is no significant change in environmental control, shall not be rated as an advanced unit, and the factory director or manager shall not be rated as an outstanding individual.

    为了美好的明天
    ——记本溪市的环境污染治理
    本报记者　谢联辉
    东经123度34分——125度46分，北纬40度49分——41度35分，在卫星拍摄的图片上，有一座看不清的东方城市——这就是被工业污染的烟尘笼罩着的中国本溪市。
    1989年，建国40周年前夕，国务委员宋健、国务院环境保护委员会、国家有关部委和辽宁省负责同志来到这里召开“本溪污染治理现场办公会”。这座全国大气污染最严重的城市就要改变容颜了。
    赵振玉的“钉子精神”
    9月23日，记者与本溪人交谈：
    “中央很关心本溪的污染，你们对治理污染有什么想法？”
    “治理污染？就是搞干净点？我们欢迎。还有什么想法？！”
    陪同我的一位40岁左右的本溪人，听到父辈漫不经心的回答，尴尬起来。怎么能说“治理污染”就是为了“干净一点”？
    曾连续6年担任本溪市环保局局长的赵振玉拉着记者的手说：我就不相信本溪人能用双手建起一座现代化程度相当高的原材料工业基地，能创造出第一流的产品，就不能治理污染、创造出一个清洁、卫生、文明的环境。
    据国家环保局同志介绍，赵振玉和他的同事们有股“钉子精神”。他们不请自来，在北京缠住这个局长、那个司长，一次次汇报，向新闻单位的记者一遍遍介绍：
    本溪市较大的烟龙有33条，每年向天空释放废气947亿标立方米，市区每年有一半时间大气能见度在50米左右。每平方公里月降尘量为53吨，超过国家标准6.2倍；全市5条较大河流有3条污染严重，其中经流市区的太子河年排入污水2亿多吨，每升含酚超标60倍，废油超标16倍，鱼虾基本绝迹；废渣每年产生1276万吨，历年堆积量达1.5亿吨，占地927万平方米……这位满脸皱纹的老局长恳切地说：“我只要求你们为本溪办两件事：一是到我们市亲眼看一看，把情况向中央汇报；二是向社会呼吁，增强人们的环境意识。”
    市长给记者介绍这位61岁的老局长时，更是动情。本溪人都知道有个赵局长，在他和他的同行宣传下，本溪人立了一条规定——“谁能治理本溪的环境污染，谁才有资格当本溪市的市长”。从1979年国家颁布《环保法》以来，在市环保局同志“钉子精神”感召下，全市共投资1.4亿元建成环保装置200多台（套）；1981年至1986年征收排污费6847万元，占工业总产值的4.2‰，为全国平均水平的3.5倍；1983年至1987年全市用于防治污染的投资占基本建设投资的8％，高于全国平均水平的1倍；“六五”期间，用于环保的投资为1.73亿元，占全市国民收入的3.33％，是同期全国平均率的5倍左右。赵振玉成了本溪的有功之臣。
      一百天的运筹决策
    1987年4月，国家环保局组织专家专程到本溪调查研究；
    1988年1月，国务院环委会组织中央和辽宁省的有关部门到本溪进行联合调查，研究这座城市的污染治理目标和资金来源；
    1988年8月，陈云同志和中央负责同志看过反映本溪等地严重污染的情况后，先后作重要批示。
    治理本溪工业污染，是一次具有深远意义的试验。国务院环委会成为研究、运筹这次试验的中心。他们一开始就把本溪市作为一个区域性的复杂城市生态系统来研究，派国家环保局一位副局长协助本溪市运筹决策，及时提供准确的信息。
    要扭转这里生态系统环境恶化的局面，使大气环境质量不低于国家三级标准，水体质量不低于五类标准，需要上多少治理项目，治理几年，投资多少？
    ——来自本溪的反馈是：对年耗煤700万吨的本溪来说，最少要降伏已经形成的“黑龙”、“黄龙”、“灰龙”，重点治理37股污水。概算起来，至少要上56个重点治理项目，投资近3.889亿元，需要用7年时间方能见效。
    根据“谁污染谁治理”的原则，各工业企业能筹集多少资金？
    ——本溪的反馈是：全市1133家工业企业，一家一家掰着手指算，把排污收费专款、设备更改资金、综合利润留成、城市维护费等全算上，只能解决1.6亿元。
    辽宁省政府决定为本溪拨出环境治理资金4000万元。
    ——经费缺口仍然很大。
    李鹏总理、姚依林副总理一次次听取环委会主任宋健的汇报，十分关心这次试验；国务院办公厅和秘书局负责同志受宋健的委托，一次次找有关部委为本溪排难。
    人们了解了本溪。这座在近代才逐步发展起来的重工业原材料基地，现在每年为国家提供356万吨铁、230万吨钢、200万吨煤、200万吨水泥，40年来累计生产生铁、钢、原煤、水泥等工业原材料2.5亿吨。他们把第一流的工业产品和重要原料送给别人，运到祖国需要的地方，而把废弃物和污染物留给了自己。
    人们感动了。国家建材局首先为自己在本溪的两个水泥厂筹集治理污染资金。经过100天的紧张协调、筹谋，1988年12月29日国务院环委会第十四次会议通过了《关于治理本溪市环境污染的决定》，并很快得到李鹏总理的批准。
      不同寻常的现场办公
    9月21日，国务委员、国务院环委会主任宋健，国务院副秘书长王书明和环委会副主任李绪鄂、曲格平，会同辽宁省省长李长春、副省长闻世震，领着中央和省里近20个部门的同志到本溪“现场办公”。
    来到本溪的第二个清晨，参加会议的同志登上一座海拔240多米高的城中花园山，鸟瞰市区上空的逆温层和城区。赵振玉向宋健汇报时说，这里是个河谷盆地，工厂区和商业区、居民区又混杂在一起，工厂烟囱冒的烟在山沟里散不出去，对市民影响很大，整个城市的布局，就像把“马桶放在饭桌上”，很不合理，治理难度大。
    宋健听了汇报后说，本溪建设布局是由历史上很多原因造成的，现在要完全改过来看来很难。像这种污染严重的重工业城市，加强群众的环境意识很重要。他指着旁边的省长、市长说，领导同志的环境意识更重要。要让大家都来关心和爱护自己生存的环境。
    这时，省长李长春拉着本钢经理张文达走到一边问：“前面那两个冒烟的烟囱是哪个厂的？”张经理回答是本钢发电厂的。省长说：“能不能在你这届任期内治好？”
    张文达表示在1992年前，一定治好这两条“黑龙”。
    “好”！李长春对周围的记者说：“我希望你们把张经理的话报道一下，到时间让大家来检查。”
    一路上，大家观看了本钢设计院为电厂设计的电除尘设备收尘效果，察看了沿途一些重点污染源。李长春省长找到于国磐市长，在询问了污染严重企业的生产和环境治理情况后，建议本溪是否可以立这样一个规矩，凡是污染严重的企业、工厂，如果在环境治理方面没有较大变化，一律不可以评为先进单位，厂长、经理不能评为模范个人。
