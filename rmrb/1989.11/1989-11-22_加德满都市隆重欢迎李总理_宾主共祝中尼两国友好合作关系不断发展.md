After Nepalese artists performed songs for the guests, Sh. P. Batraji, on behalf of the people of Kathmandu, delivered a speech. He said that Premier Li's visit would further strengthen the close friendly relations between Nepal and China.

He said that China's support for Nepal's proposal for a peace zone is a full understanding and respect for the Nepalese people's aspirations for peace and development.

He said, "China and Nepal have been good neighbors and friends since ancient times. When China faced difficulties, the Nepalese government and people always showed understanding and support. He pointed out, 'The Chinese people have genuine friendly feelings for the Nepalese people and have always firmly supported the Nepalese people's efforts to defend national independence, sovereignty, and develop the national economy. We firmly support King Birendra's proposal to declare Nepal a peace zone. Practice has proven that Sino-Nepalese friendship can withstand the test of time and has strong vitality. The Chinese government highly values the friendship with Nepal, and the Chinese people will always be reliable friends of the Nepalese people.'"

Premier Li, after introducing China's construction achievements, said, "Although there are still many difficulties on the road ahead, I believe our goals will be achieved.
