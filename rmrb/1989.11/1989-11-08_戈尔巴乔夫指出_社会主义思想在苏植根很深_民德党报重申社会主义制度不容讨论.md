	Gorbachev Points Out That Socialist Thought Is Deeply Rooted in the Soviet Union

	The East German Party Newspaper Reiterates That the Socialist System Is Not Up for Discussion

	Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 6 - Soviet leader Gorbachev said that socialist thought is deeply rooted in the Soviet Union. Those who attempt to question the socialist choice not only go against the social mood but also directly conflict with the stance of the working people.

	According to today's *Pravda*, some renowned economists, enterprise leaders, and people's deputies recently held their second roundtable discussion at the CPSU Central Committee, focusing on the current economic situation in the Soviet Union and how to deepen economic reforms. Gorbachev expressed the above views in his concluding remarks at the meeting.

	He said that in the Soviet Union, people have a common understanding of the fundamental idea, which is to revitalize society through reforms, to bring about new prospects in various aspects of social life, and to more fully tap into socialist potential.

	When discussing how to find a way out of the current complex situation, Gorbachev pointed out that one must first soberly consider the specific political realities of the Soviet Union at present, that is, one must dialectically evaluate and view the economic, political processes, and social conditions.

	Gorbachev expressed that he opposes the idea of completely denying socialism and also does not support the proposal to regress.

	Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 6 - The central organ of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, *Neues Deutschland*, today published a commentary reiterating that the socialist system of the German Democratic Republic is not up for discussion, and the German Democratic Republic itself neither sells itself to anyone nor will it merge with any country.

	In response to recent proposals by some people in West Germany for the so-called "reconstruction of the German Empire's 1937 borders" and the statement by U.S. President's National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft that the situation in the German Democratic Republic might become explosive, this newspaper reiterated the above stance of the German Democratic Republic.

	The commentary said that what Scowcroft referred to as an "explosive situation" is nothing more than the disappearance of socialism from the German Democratic Republic and the absorption of a sovereign state. This is precisely what those who are summoning the spirit of the German Empire yearn for.

	The commentary pointed out that the current turning point in the GDR and the reforms that are about to begin "are not to do less but to do more and better socialism, to bring more benefits to the people at home, and to be more attractive to others."

	The commentary also warned that socialist reforms are bound to have some radical actions, but one must remain calm, take responsible actions, and especially maintain vigilance to prevent sabotage and interference from Western anti-socialist forces.

    戈尔巴乔夫指出
    社会主义思想在苏植根很深
    民德党报重申社会主义制度不容讨论
    新华社莫斯科11月6日电　苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫说，社会主义思想在苏联植根很深。那些企图对社会主义选择提出疑问的人，不仅与社会情绪背道而驰，而且直接同劳动人民的立场发生矛盾。
    据今天《真理报》报道，一些著名经济学家、企业的领导人以及人民代表最近在苏共中央举行第二次座谈会，重点讨论苏联当前的经济形势和如何深化经济改革的问题。戈尔巴乔夫是在会议结束作总结发言时阐述上述观点的。
    他说，在苏联，人们对基本思想有一种共同理解，那就是通过改革来振兴社会，使社会生活在各个领域出现新的气象，更充分地挖掘社会主义潜力。
    在谈到如何从目前复杂的形势中寻找出路时，戈尔巴乔夫指出，首先应当清醒地考虑当前苏联具体的政治现实，也就是应当辩证地估量和看待经济、政治进程和社会状况。
    戈尔巴乔夫表示，既反对全盘否定社会主义的想法，也不赞同向后倒退的主张。
    新华社柏林11月6日电　德国统一社会党中央机关报《新德意志报》今天发表述评重申，民主德国的社会主义制度是不容讨论的，民主德国自身也是既不把自己卖给什么人，也不会同哪个国家合并。
    针对最近西德某些人提出的所谓“重建1937年疆界的德意志帝国”的白日梦，以及美国总统国家安全顾问布伦特·斯考克罗夫特的所谓“民主德国局势可能出现爆炸性的局面”的说法，这家报纸重申了民主德国的上述立场。
    述评说，斯考克罗夫特所说的“爆炸性局面”，无非是指社会主义从民主德国消失，一个主权的国家被吞噬。这恰恰是那些为德意志帝国招魂的人所梦寐以求的。
    述评指出，目前在民德出现的转折和将要开始的改革，“不是为了少搞，而是为了更多更好地搞社会主义，使社会主义给国内的人民带来更多的好处，在别人看来更加具有吸引力”。
    述评还告诫人们，社会主义改革难免有些过激行动，但是要注意冷静，要采取负责任的行动，尤其是要保持警惕性，防止来自西方敌视社会主义势力的破坏和干扰。
