    Nationwide Extra-Budgetary Funds Growing Too Rapidly, Approaching National Budget Revenue
    Experts Suggest Controlling and Strengthening Management

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 27 - (Reporter Ding Jianming) According to a recent summary by the Ministry of Finance of the nationwide extra-budgetary funds, in 1988, the nationwide extra-budgetary funds continued to grow at a significant rate, with the total amount approaching the national budget revenue for that year. However, the use of these funds was not entirely reasonable, with non-productive expenditures growing too rapidly.

    Statistics show that in 1988, nationwide extra-budgetary revenue was 236.08 billion yuan, equivalent to 94.8% of the national budget revenue for that year, an increase of 33.19 billion yuan over the previous year, a growth of 16.4%. The total extra-budgetary expenditure for the year was 214.53 billion yuan, an increase of 30.45 billion yuan over the previous year, a growth of 16.5%. After deducting expenditures, the surplus for the year was 21.55 billion yuan, and the year-end rolling surplus was 163.74 billion yuan.

    From the perspective of 1988's extra-budgetary revenue, the extra-budgetary funds managed by state-owned enterprises and their supervising departments, administrative and public institutions, and local finance departments all increased compared to the previous year. Among these, the extra-budgetary revenue of state-owned enterprises and their supervising departments was 187.289 billion yuan, an increase of 24.71 billion yuan over the previous year, a growth of 15.2%. The extra-budgetary revenue of administrative and public institutions was 43.89 billion yuan, an increase of 8.05 billion yuan over the previous year, a growth of 22.5%.

    In 1988, the rapid growth of nationwide extra-budgetary funds exceeded the growth rate of national budget revenue. This was partly due to the normal development of production, circulation, and various undertakings, but it also involved some irrational factors. For example, some enterprises exploited loopholes in the national tax reduction and profit-sharing policies to evade taxes,乱摊成本 (spread costs arbitrarily), and hide income. Some administrative and public institutions, taking advantage of the policy of liberalization and dynamism, created new fees, expanded the scope of fees, and increased fee standards, converting budgetary revenue into extra-budgetary revenue.

    It is understood that in 1988, the direction of nationwide extra-budgetary funds had improved to some extent, but the expenditure structure was still not entirely reasonable. Among these, the extra-budgetary fixed asset investment expenditure increased by 10.1% over the previous year. Welfare expenditure, reward expenditure, public service expenditure, and administrative expenditure—the four non-productive expenditures—increased by 20.4% over the previous year, with the growth rate still too fast.

    Some experts believe that in recent years, the nationwide extra-budgetary funds have maintained a high growth rate, which has played a certain positive role in accelerating enterprise technological transformation, promoting horizontal economic cooperation, promoting public welfare undertakings, and making up for the shortage of local government funds. However, it should also be noted that the rapid growth of extra-budgetary funds has led to the dispersion of national financial power and the reduction of national budgetary financial power. Especially because the expenditure structure of extra-budgetary funds is not reasonable, the rapidly growing extra-budgetary funds have become a major cause of the over-expansion of the national fixed asset investment scale, the inflation of consumption funds, and the loss of control over social purchasing power.

    Experts believe that currently, the proportion of nationwide extra-budgetary funds in national income has risen from 13.4% in 1979 to 20%. The scale of extra-budgetary funds is too large, which is not conducive to the national comprehensive balance of the national economy and is not conducive to the national guarantee of key project construction. Therefore, experts propose that at present, it is necessary to appropriately control the scale of extra-budgetary funds, adjust the proportion of budgetary and extra-budgetary funds, and incorporate some large and surplus extra-budgetary fund projects of administrative and public institutions into the budget. Special funds held by some departments should also be incorporated into financial management to strengthen supervision and guidance. In addition, legislative work should be strengthened to make the management of extra-budgetary funds quickly move towards a standardized and legalized track.

    全国预算外资金增长过快
　　总额已接近国家预算收入
　　行家提议适当控制加强管理
    新华社北京11月27日电　（记者丁坚铭）据财政部最近对全国预算外资金决算汇总的情况表明，1988年全国预算外资金仍有较大幅度的增长，总额已经接近于当年国家预算收入，但预算外资金使用不尽合理，非生产性支出增长过快。
    据统计，1988年全国预算外收入为2360.8亿元，相当于当年国家预算收入的94.8％，比上年增加331.9亿元，增长16.4％；全年预算外支出为2145.3亿元，比上年增加304.5亿元，增长16.5％；收支相抵，当年结余215.5亿元，年终滚存结余1637.4亿元。
    从1988年预算外收入情况看，国营企业及其主管部门、行政事业单位和地方财政部门管理的预算外资金都比上年有所增加，其中，国营企业及其主管部门的预算外收入为1872.89亿元，比上年增加247.1亿元，增长15.2％；行政事业单位的预算外收入为438.9亿元，比上年增加80.5亿元，增长22.5％。
    1988年全国预算外资金收入增长过快，超过了国家预算收入的增长速度，这固然有生产、流通和各项事业发展的正常原因，但也存在部分预算外资金来路不正当的不合理因素。例如一些企业钻国家减税让利政策的空子，偷税漏税，乱摊成本，隐瞒收入；一些行政、事业单位则借放开、搞活之机巧立名目，增设收费项目，扩大收费范围，提高收费标准，化预算内收入为预算外收入。
    据了解，1988年全国预算外资金流向有了一定改善，但支出结构仍不尽合理，其中预算外固定资产投资支出比上年增长10.1％；福利支出、奖励支出、事业支出及行政支出等四项非生产性支出比上年增长20.4％，增长幅度仍然过快。
    一些行家认为，近几年全国预算外资金一直保持较高的增长速度，这对加快企业技术改造，促进横向经济联合，推动公益事业发展及弥补地方政府财力不足等方面起到了一定的积极作用。但也应看到，预算外资金增长过快带来的直接后果是国家财力过于分散和国家预算财力过小。特别是由于预算外资金支出结构不合理，迅速增长的预算外资金已成了目前全国固定资产投资规模过大、消费基金膨胀和社会集团购买力失控的一个主要原因。
    行家们认为，目前全国预算外资金收入占国民收入的比重已由1979年的13.4％上升到20％。预算外资金规模偏大，不利于国家对国民经济的综合平衡，也不利于国家保证重点项目的建设。为此，行家们提出，当前应适当控制预算外资金的规模，调整预算内和预算外资金的比例关系，对行政事业单位一些数额较大、结余较多的预算外资金项目应纳入预算内，对一些部门掌握的专项资金也应纳入财政管理，以加强监督和引导。此外，应加强立法工作，使预算外资金的管理尽快走上规范化、法律化的轨道。
