Recently, a reporter from this newspaper learned from the Price Supervision and Inspection Bureau of the State Price Bureau that the illegal activities of Shanghai Huadong Timber Trading Center, Wuhan Changjiang Timber Comprehensive Trading Company, and Shenyang Beifang Timber United Trading Company in speculatively buying and selling state-planned timber quotas, buying on margin and selling short, and reselling at a markup have been recently uncovered by the Price Supervision and Inspection Bureau of the State Price Bureau.

On August 22, 1987, Wuhan Changjiang Timber Comprehensive Trading Company purchased 10,000 cubic meters of imported timber from Wuhan City Timber Company, which was in the same office building. On the same day, the company resold this batch of timber at a markup to the same Wuhan City Timber Company, earning illegal profits of 600,000 yuan.

Shanghai Huadong Timber Comprehensive Trading Center's method of making money was to resell planned internal delivery notes as planned external delivery notes, buying on margin and selling short, earning illegal profits of over 6 million yuan in four years.

Shenyang Beifang Timber United Trading Company, through the method of speculatively buying quotas and then reselling planned internal timber as planned external timber, earned illegal profits of over 6.2 million yuan in 1987 and 1988.

To uphold the law, the Price Supervision and Inspection Bureau recently decided to confiscate all illegal earnings from the three companies and impose a fine of three times the illegal earnings. It is suggested that the State Supervision Department impose administrative sanctions on the direct responsible parties.
