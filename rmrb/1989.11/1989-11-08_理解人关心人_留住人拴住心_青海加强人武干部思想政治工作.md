Over the past three years, the Qinghai Provincial Military District and various military sub-districts have focused on the practical work of county-level People's Armed Forces Departments (PADs) and have emphasized the importance of ideological and political work among PAD cadres. This has laid a solid foundation for them to take root and work in the highlands.

Three years ago, the voluntary transfer rate of PAD cadres in Qinghai reached 100%. However, due to the harsh environment and changes in subordination, many cadres developed a "syndrome of maladjustment": altitude sickness, language barriers for Han cadres in autonomous prefectures, and difficulties in adapting to life. They also missed the timely logistical support from the military. As a result, they were not content with their work.

The Provincial Military District Party Committee realized that retaining people does not mean retaining their hearts. Ideological and political work cannot be relaxed. They seized opportunities such as traditional festivals, seasonal changes, military promotions, policy adjustments, and leadership changes. They sent out 98 work teams to conduct ideological and political education on professional ethics, party spirit, and ideals in 42 PADs. They summarized and promoted nearly 100 advanced examples of "taking root in the highlands and creating prosperity through hard work." They extensively carried out the "four comparisons" activities: comparing consciousness, discipline, style, and contributions. Yang Qiyin, the political commissar of the Republican County PAD in Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, resolutely transferred his wife from Nantong County, Jiangsu, to work in the highlands. Under his influence, 11 cadres from inland areas have been working diligently in the highlands to this day.

The various levels of the Provincial Military District Party Committee especially emphasized respecting, understanding, and caring for people. They combined solving ideological problems with addressing practical difficulties. They solved the household registration problems for 218 PAD cadre families and replaced vehicles for 24 county PADs.

The Provincial Military District Party Committee also guided PAD cadres to consciously serve the overall economic construction and actively participate in the construction of both material and spiritual civilization. The province sent over 1,000 PAD cadres, along with active militia and reserve personnel, to participate in poverty alleviation work. By the end of last year, they had helped 15,313 households escape poverty. In the province, 8 units and individuals in PADs and militia have been commended by the state and the entire military. 28 county PADs have been rated as advanced units at the county, prefecture, and provincial levels, accounting for 67% of county-level PADs.

### 理解人关心人　留住人拴住心  青海加强人武干部思想政治工作

    理解人关心人　留住人拴住心
    青海加强人武干部思想政治工作
    本报讯　近3年来，青海省军区、各军分区党委针对县级人武部改建后的工作实际，重视做好人武干部的思想政治工作，使人武干部打下了扎根高原工作的牢固思想根基。
    3年前，青海人武干部自愿移交率达100％。后来，由于环境艰苦和隶属关系的变化，不少人产生了“不适应综合症”：高山反应，汉族干部在民族自治州语言不通，生活不习惯，少了部队后勤保障及时的优越性。因此不安心工作。
    省军区党委意识到：留住了人，不等于留住了心。思想政治工作不能放松，他们抓住传统节日、四季变化、军队授衔、政策调整、班子换届等时机，先后派出98个工作组，对42个人武部普遍进行职业道德、党性和理想教育，总结推广近百个“扎根高原，艰苦创业”的先进典型，广泛开展思想上比觉悟、纪律上比严格、作风上比扎实、工作上比贡献的“四比”活动。海南藏族自治州共和县人武部政委杨企斌毅然把爱人从江苏南通县调来高原工作。在他的带动下，部里11名内地籍干部至今安心高原工作。
    省军区各级党委特别强调尊重人、理解人、关心人，把解决思想问题与解决实际困难结合起来，先后为218名人武干部职工解决了随调家属户口问题，为24个县人武部更换了车辆。
    省军区党委还引导人武干部自觉服从经济建设大局，积极参加两个文明建设。全省先后派出1000多名人武干部，和基干民兵、预备役人员一道投入扶贫工作，截至去年底已使15313户群众脱贫。全省人武部和民兵中，有8个单位和个人先后受到国家和全军表彰；28个县人武部被评为县、州、省先进单位，占县级人武部的67％。（郅振璞　姚保荣　赵波）
