	Build Nursing Homes First, Delay Construction of Official Buildings

	In our city's Chuntai Township, there are 36 officials, but only 6 people live in the government dormitories built 10 years ago. The remaining 30 officials either rent public or private homes, stay in guesthouses, or live with their parents. The township head, Wan Yinyong, and the township People's Congress director, Wan Xiangrui, still sleep on small beds set up in their offices. Someone proposed building an official dormitory to solve the housing difficulties of the officials. However, the township Party committee and the township government believed that what the township urgently needs is a nursing home to take care of elderly people who are alone. Therefore, they used the 120,000 yuan originally planned for the official dormitory to build a nursing home with a construction area of over 600 square meters. Before National Day, 14 elderly people who are alone in the township happily moved into the spacious and bright nursing home.

    先建敬老院  缓盖干部楼
    我市春台乡政府有36名干部，只有6人住在10年前盖的机关宿舍里，其余30人，有的租用公产民房，有的住招待所，还有的在父母家中挤住。乡长万银勇、乡人大主任万祥瑞至今还在办公室里搭个小床住宿。有人提议盖一栋干部宿舍楼，解决干部的住宿困难，乡党委、乡政府则认为乡里现在急需的是建一所敬老院，供养孤寡老人。于是，他们用原打算建干部宿舍的12万元资金，盖起了一所建筑面积达600多平方米的敬老院。国庆前夕，乡里14位孤寡老人高高兴兴地住进了宽敞明亮的敬老院。
