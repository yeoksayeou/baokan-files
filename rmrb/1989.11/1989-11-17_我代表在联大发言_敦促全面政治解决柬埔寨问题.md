    China's representative at the UN speaks
    Urges a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian problem

    People's Daily, United Nations, November 15th - Correspondent Liu Kai Chen reports: Today, at the 44th session of the UN General Assembly discussing the situation in Cambodia, China's Permanent Representative to the UN, Li Luye, reiterated that China is willing to continue working with the international community to ensure that the Cambodian issue is ultimately resolved comprehensively, justly, and durably.

    Li Luye emphasized that the two core issues for a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian problem are: Vietnam must completely and cleanly withdraw its troops from Cambodia, and a four-party interim joint government led by Prince Sihanouk must be established. These two issues are interrelated and must be resolved simultaneously. One addresses the end of aggression, and the other addresses the elimination of the consequences of aggression.

    Li Luye pointed out that Vietnam's recent unilateral announcement of troop withdrawal lacks international supervision and verification and "does not constitute an effective part of a comprehensive solution." The Vietnamese authorities, using various excuses, refuse to accept the United Nations' role in international supervision, which only shows their lack of sincerity in resolving the Cambodian issue.

    Li Luye stated that China has consistently advocated for the establishment of a four-party interim joint government led by Prince Sihanouk. The Vietnamese authorities stubbornly refuse to genuinely accept Sihanouk's leadership and insist on excluding one faction of the Cambodian resistance forces, essentially aiming to allow the Hun Sen-Khieu Samphan regime to continue ruling Cambodia. Li Luye finally reiterated that after a comprehensive agreement is reached on the Cambodian issue and Vietnam fully withdraws its troops from Cambodia under UN supervision, China will, together with relevant countries, assume the necessary obligations and is willing to provide international guarantees for Cambodia's future independence, sovereignty, neutrality, and non-aligned status.

    我代表在联大发言
    敦促全面政治解决柬埔寨问题
    本报联合国11月15日电  记者刘开宸报道：中国常驻联合国代表李鹿野今天在第44届联大审议柬埔寨局势问题时发言，重申中国愿意同国际社会一道继续作出努力，使柬埔寨问题最终获得全面、公正和持久的解决。
    李鹿野强调，全面政治解决柬埔寨问题的两个核心问题是：越南必须彻底干净地从柬埔寨撤军和成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府。这两个问题，一个是结束侵略问题，另一个是消除侵略造成的后果问题。两者不可分割，必须同时解决。
    李鹿野指出，越南最近单方面宣布的撤军，没有国际监督和核查，并“不构成全面解决的一个有效部分”。越南当局以种种借口拒绝接受联合国在国际监督问题上发挥作用，只能说明它对解决柬埔寨问题没有诚意。
    李鹿野表示，中国一贯主张成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府，越南当局顽固地拒绝真正以西哈努克为首，并坚持排除民柬抵抗力量某一方，实质上是要让韩桑林—洪森政权继续在柬埔寨占据统治地位。李鹿野最后重申，在柬埔寨问题达成全面协议和越南在联合国监督下真正、全部从柬撤军后，中国将同有关国家一道，承担必要的义务，并愿为未来柬的独立、主权、中立和不结盟地位作出国际保证。
