The first domestically developed technology for producing MSG directly from corn was recently approved by the Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission and the Jiangsu Provincial Science and Technology Commission. The technology has since been put into industrial-scale production.

For a long time, China's MSG production has relied on refined grains such as starch and rice as raw materials. The Shanghai Institute of Industrial Microbiology, considering China's national conditions, has developed a new fermentation process using corn as the direct raw material for producing glutamic acid. In collaboration with the Rudong Biochemical Factory in Jiangsu, they successfully conducted trial productions using 30 cubic meter and 100 cubic meter fermentation tanks. If this technology is promoted to half of the MSG factories nationwide, it can save over 100 million yuan in costs annually and conserve nearly 500,000 tons of rice.

　　玉米能直接造味精
    本报南通十一月二十八日电国内首创的用玉米直接生产味精的新工艺，近日通过上海市科委和江苏省科委组织的技术鉴定，并投入工业化生产。
    长期以来，我国味精生产只能以淀粉、大米等精粮为原料。上海市工业微生物研究所根据我国国情，推出了直接以玉米为原料的谷氨酸粗原料发酵新工艺，并在江苏如东生物化学总厂的配合下，用三十立方米和一百立方米发酵罐一次试产成功。该工艺如在全国一半味精厂推广，每年即可节约成本一亿多元，节约大米近五十万吨。
