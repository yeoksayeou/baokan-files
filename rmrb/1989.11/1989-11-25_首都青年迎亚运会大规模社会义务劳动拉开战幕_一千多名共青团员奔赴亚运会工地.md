Capital youth welcome the Asian Games with a large-scale social volunteer labor effort, which began on November 20. Over the past three days, more than 1,200 young Communist Youth League members have voluntarily gone to the Asian Games construction sites to participate in cleaning up garbage and debris, dredging ditches, leveling land, and other environmental improvement projects around the Asian Village.

It is reported that within a 4.6-square-kilometer area around the Asian Village, there are hundreds of large and small garbage piles. In addition to construction debris, there are also many urban living garbage piles, including dozens of large garbage piles weighing over 100 tons each.

To ensure that this volunteer labor effort proceeds in an orderly and effective manner, the Municipal Communist Youth League organized the young members to prioritize several key projects for initial construction. Different sections have been divided into batches and phases for the allocation of manpower and resources. In just three days, a total of 81 engineering vehicles have been deployed, clearing green spaces and leveling land covering 15,700 square meters, removing 3,295 cubic meters of garbage and debris, and clearing 900 meters of ditches, achieving initial results.

　　首都青年迎亚运会大规模社会义务劳动拉开战幕
　　一千多名共青团员奔赴亚运会工地
    新华社北京11月23日电　（记者王蔚）首都青年迎接亚运会大规模社会义务劳动，自11月20日起拉开战幕。3天来，1200多名团员青年主动奔赴亚运会工地，投入清运垃圾渣土、疏通沟渠、平整土地等亚运村周围环境整治工程。
    据介绍，在亚运村周围4.6平方公里的范围内，积存着大大小小的垃圾堆数百处，不仅有建筑渣土，还有很多城市生活垃圾，其中百吨以上的大垃圾堆几十个。
    为了使这次义务劳动紧张有序、卓有成效地进行，团市委组织团员青年确定了几处“卡脖子”工程先期开工，各路段分批分期投入人力、物力，仅仅3天，共出动工程车辆81辆，清理绿地、平整土地1.57万多平方米，清运垃圾渣土3295立方米，清理边沟900米，取得了初步的效果。
