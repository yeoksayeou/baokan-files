Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 6th.

Reports from local newspapers today indicate that Japanese Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki emphasized during a review of the Maritime Self-Defense Force yesterday that the international situation remains complex and turbulent. Japan, in particular, must strengthen its defense of maritime transportation lines.

The 58-year-old prime minister stressed that Japan is surrounded by the sea on all sides and relies on trade, so ensuring the safety of maritime transportation is crucial. In this regard, the Maritime Self-Defense Force has a very important responsibility.

Kaifu had mentioned in early October in the Diet that he was considering deploying the Self-Defense Forces overseas to protect Japanese nationals abroad.

An official from the Defense Agency stated that the military deployed overseas will also provide protection for the transport of plutonium to Japan. It is understood that the Defense Agency is currently studying the possibility of adding an aircraft carrier to the Japanese Navy.

    海部强调加强海上运输线防卫力量
    新华社东京11月6日电　据此间报纸今天报道，日本首相海部俊树昨天在检阅海上自卫队仪式上强调，国际形势依然复杂动荡，日本尤其要加强海上运输线的防卫力量。
    这位58岁的首相强调说，日本四面环海，贸易立国，因此确保海上运输的安全是重要的。在这点上，海上自卫队的责任极为重大。
    海部今年10月初在议会中曾说，他开始考虑向海外派驻日本自卫队，让其担负保护日本海外国民之任务。
    防卫厅的官员说，日本在海外部署的军队还将为向日本运送钚的航运提供保护。据悉，防卫厅目前正在研究给日本海军增加一艘航空母舰的可能性。
