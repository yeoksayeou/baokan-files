Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 3rd.

The meeting of chairpersons of the People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committees from various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government began this morning in the Great Hall of the People.

Alpai Wanqingjie, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, spoke at the meeting. He emphasized that the work of the People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committees should adhere to the Party's basic line for the primary stage of socialism. It should uphold the fundamental principles of maintaining national unity, ethnic equality, ethnic unity, and common prosperity in ethnic work. The committees should focus on the comprehensive implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, strengthen ethnic legal construction, and promote the accelerated development of the economy and culture in ethnic regions.

The main agenda of this meeting, convened by the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, includes soliciting opinions on the draft report to the Standing Committee regarding the implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy and current issues in ethnic work. The meeting will also exchange experiences and discuss how the People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committees can better play their roles in improving the People's Congress system and strengthening socialist democracy and legal construction.

Alpai Wanqingjie reviewed the work and major achievements of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, with a focus on the implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy. He said that over the past ten years, significant progress has been made in ethnic legal construction based on the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy. Since the law was promulgated and implemented five years ago, 49 new autonomous regions have been established in accordance with the law. Currently, there are 5 autonomous regions, 30 autonomous prefectures, and 122 autonomous counties, totaling 157 autonomous regions nationwide. The newly established autonomous regions account for nearly one-third of the total number of autonomous regions. The population of ethnic minorities practicing autonomy now accounts for about 78% of the total ethnic minority population. The task of establishing autonomous regions nationwide has been basically completed. The promulgation and implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy mark the entry of China's ethnic regional autonomy system into a new stage.

Alpai Wanqingjie stressed that the Party's basic line of one central task and two fundamental principles is the lifeline of ethnic work. He said that the Party's four cardinal principles are the foundation of the state and the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups. The Party's policy of reform and opening up is the path to national strength and the common prosperity of all ethnic groups in the country. Without reform and opening up, our ethnic groups would be confined to a narrow natural economy, unable to develop socialist commodity economy, and unable to achieve modernization. Only by focusing on economic construction can our country shake off poverty and backwardness, achieve modernization, and enable the Chinese nation to stand proudly among the world's nations.

He said that adhering to the four cardinal principles, opposing bourgeois liberalization, and opposing the sabotage of domestic and foreign class enemies are also important issues in ethnic regions at present. The unrest in Lhasa was an attempt by domestic and foreign enemies to split our country and sabotage the socialist cause in Tibet. There are still incidents where a few people distort and insult ethnic minorities in literary works. The publication of books like "Sexual Customs" that hurt the feelings of ethnic minorities has had a very bad impact. Stability and unity are in the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups in the country, and we must maintain the overall situation of stability and unity.

Alpai Wanqingjie emphasized that China is a country with 56 ethnic groups and a population of 1.1 billion. All ethnic groups have jointly created the long history and brilliant culture of the motherland. Ethnic issues occupy a very important position in the national life of our country, and ethnic work is a regular task that the National People's Congress and the People's Congresses of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government must grasp.

Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Peng Chong and Fei Xiaotong attended the meeting and spoke. Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Liao Hansheng and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Sima Yi Aimaiti participated in the meeting.

    各地人大民委主任会议在京举行
    阿沛指出全国建立自治地方的任务已经基本完成
    强调党的一个中心两个基本点是民族工作生命线
    新华社北京11月3日电　（记者曹绍平、郑庆东）全国各省、自治区、直辖市人大民委主任会议今天上午在人民大会堂开始举行。
    全国人大常委会副委员长、全国人大民委主任委员阿沛·阿旺晋美在讲话中指出，人大民委工作要遵循党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线，坚持维护祖国统一、民族平等、民族团结和共同繁荣的民族工作基本方针，围绕民族区域自治法的全面贯彻实施，加强民族法制建设，推动民族地区经济文化的加速发展。
    由全国人大民委召开的这次会议的主要议题是：征求对贯彻实施民族区域自治法和当前民族工作中的问题向委员长会议的汇报提纲的意见，交流各地人大民族工作情况和经验，讨论人大民委在继续完善人民代表大会制度，加强社会主义民主和法制建设中，如何更好地发挥作用的问题。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美在讲话中回顾了全国人大民委的工作情况和主要成就，着重介绍了民族区域自治法贯彻执行的情况。他说，十年来，我们以民族区域自治法为基础的民族法制建设取得了重大进展。民族区域自治法颁布实施五年来，依法新建了49个自治地方，现在全国共有5个自治区、30个自治州、122个自治县，共计157个民族自治地方。新建的民族自治地方占民族自治地方总数的近1／3。现在实行自治的少数民族人口已占少数民族总人口的78％左右，全国建立自治地方的任务已基本完成。自治法的颁布实施，标志着我国民族区域自治制度进入了新阶段。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美强调，党的一个中心、两个基本点的基本路线，是民族工作的生命线。他说，党的四项基本原则是立国之本，也是各族人民根本利益所在。党的改革开放方针是强国之路，也是全国各民族共同繁荣之路。不实行改革开放，我们各民族将被封闭在狭小的自然经济的天地，无法发展社会主义的商品经济，不可能走向现代化。只有以经济建设为中心，我国才能摆脱贫困落后，实现现代化，中华各民族才有可能自立于世界民族之林。
    他说，坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化，反对国内外阶级敌人的破坏，也是当前民族地区的一个重要问题。拉萨发生的骚乱事件，就是国内外敌人妄图分裂我们国家，破坏西藏社会主义事业而策动的。极少数人在文艺作品中歪曲和侮辱少数民族的事还时有发生，出版《性风俗》等伤害少数民族感情的坏书，造成了极为恶劣的影响。安定团结是全国各族人民的根本利益，我们一定要维护安定团结的大局。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美强调，我国是一个拥有56个民族11亿人口的大国，各民族共同创造了祖国悠久的历史和灿烂的文化。民族问题在我国的国家生活中占有十分重要的地位，民族工作是全国人大和各省、自治区、直辖市人大必须抓好的经常性工作。
    全国人大常委会副委员长彭冲、费孝通出席会议并讲了话，全国人大常委会副委员长廖汉生、全国政协副主席司马义·艾买提参加了会议。
