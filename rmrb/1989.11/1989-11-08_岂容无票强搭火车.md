    How Can One Allow Unticketed People to Forcefully Board Trains

    On the morning of September 3, after the 681 train stopped at Jiangxi Húshān Station, approximately 20 villagers without tickets climbed onto the first empty flatcar behind the locomotive. After attempts to dissuade them failed, the train conductor, after seeking permission, detached the flatcar. However, these villagers then climbed onto the back of the locomotive. When the driver got off to stop them, these people assaulted the driver, seized the driver's inspection hammer and the conductor's signal flag, causing the 681 train to be delayed for 3 hours. It is understood that these villagers are from Xinyu City, Yúshuì District, Húshān Township.

    Similar incidents frequently occur in this area. On May 18, when railway public security personnel were intercepting train thieves and unticketed passengers, they were attacked by over a hundred villagers. To ensure the smooth operation of railway transportation, it is hoped that the local government and relevant departments will seriously handle such incidents.

    岂容无票强搭火车
    9月3日上午，681次列车刚停靠在江西鹄山站，约20名无票村民爬上机车后第一节空平板车，在劝阻无效的情况下，车长经请示将平板车摘解下。不料这些村民又爬上机车的后身，司机下车劝止，这些人对司机大打出手，抢走司机的检查锤和车长的信号旗，致使681次列车被阻达3小时。据了解，这些村民是新余市渝水区鹄山乡村民。
    类似事件在此处时常发生。5月18日，铁路公安人员在阻截车盗和无票爬车人员时，遭上百名村民围攻。为了确保铁路运输畅通无阻，希望当地政府以及有关部门对类似事件严肃处理。
