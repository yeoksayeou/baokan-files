Premier Li Peng and his wife, Zhu Lin, concluded their successful official friendly visit to Pakistan and arrived in Dhaka, Bangladesh, by special plane at 2:00 PM local time today. They were greeted with a grand and warm welcome.

Premier Li Peng is visiting Bangladesh at the invitation of President H.M. Ershad. This is his first visit to Bangladesh since taking office as Premier of the State Council.

Today, Dhaka was bathed in bright sunshine with a gentle breeze. The international airport was adorned with the national flags of China and Bangladesh, and large portraits of Premier Li Peng and President Ershad. Thousands of enthusiastic crowds gathered at the airport.

Premier Li Peng and his wife were warmly welcomed by President Ershad at the airport. Vice President Moudud and his wife, Prime Minister Kazi and his wife, as well as all cabinet members and senior military leaders, were also present to welcome them. President Ershad warmly embraced Premier Li Peng at the foot of the aircraft stairs, exchanging cordial greetings.

A grand welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. The military band played the national anthems of both countries, and a 19-gun salute was fired. Premier Li Peng, accompanied by President Ershad, inspected the three-service honor guard. Afterwards, Premier Li Peng shook hands with the high-ranking military and political officials of Bangladesh and foreign diplomats who came to welcome him.

As Premier Li Peng and his wife left the airport with President Ershad and his wife, hundreds of Bangladeshi girls dressed in colorful attire threw rose petals and jasmine flowers to wish the Chinese guests good fortune. Along the more than ten-kilometer route from the airport to the state guesthouse, Premier Li Peng was greeted by tens of thousands of people lining the streets.

Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Chen Songlu and his wife, diplomatic staff of the embassy, and representatives of Chinese experts working in Bangladesh also went to the airport to welcome Premier Li Peng and his delegation.

Premier Li Peng delivered a written speech at the airport, saying: "The people of China and Bangladesh have a traditional friendship. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, through the joint efforts of both sides, the friendly cooperative relations between China and Bangladesh have made significant progress in various fields, including politics, economy, and culture. It is the common wish of the people of both countries to further promote this friendly cooperative relationship. I am visiting Bangladesh with the belief of enhancing friendship, strengthening understanding, and expanding cooperation. I look forward to exchanging views with President Ershad on bilateral relations and international issues of mutual concern, and I hope to have extensive contact with people from all walks of life in your country to make more friends."

This morning, as the special plane left Pakistani airspace, Premier Li Peng sent a telegram from the plane to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, expressing his deep gratitude for the warm welcome and generous hospitality extended to him by her, the Pakistani government, and people.

As the plane flew over Indian airspace, Premier Li Peng sent a message from the plane to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, extending his cordial greetings and best wishes.
