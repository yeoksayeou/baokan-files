Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, November 13th — (Correspondents: Jiāng Shèngguó, Gāo Rìhóng) The educational authorities of Yushan County, Shandong Province, have seriously reflected on past educational mistakes and corrected the erroneous tendency of prioritizing intellectual education over moral education. They have placed a firm and correct political direction at the forefront, focusing on improving and purifying the educational environment in primary and secondary schools, and ensuring that ideological and political work is effectively implemented.

In recent months, the educational authorities of Yushan County have organized study sessions and seminars for teachers and educational political workers. Through discussions and comparative analyses, they have recognized that in recent years, primary and secondary schools have generally placed more emphasis on imparting knowledge than on ideological and political education. Additionally, the ideological and political work teams within schools have weakened, leading to confusion among some teachers and students. To change the passive situation of ideological and political work in schools, they have focused on improving the educational environment.

The county has comprehensively strengthened the ideological construction of the teaching staff. All primary and secondary schools in the county have organized teachers to engage in study sessions to enhance their political awareness, enabling all subject teachers to integrate political and ideological education with their teaching work. Meanwhile, the educational authorities and schools have set comprehensive requirements for teachers, evaluating their work based on both professional standards and political criteria.

At the same time, a network combining schools, society, and families has been established and perfected to expand students' ideological and political work to society and into families. All primary and secondary schools in the county have implemented a system for contacting parents, with teachers regularly visiting homes and holding parent-teacher meetings. Additionally, extracurricular education liaison points have been established in student residential areas, and "Youth Homes" have been set up. Officials, workers, and parents who are skilled in child education have been appointed as counselors.

    建立健全学校社会家庭三结合教育网络
    乳山全面净化育人环境
    据新华社济南11月13日电　（通讯员姜胜国、高日红）山东省乳山县教育部门认真反思教育失误，纠正“重智育、轻德育”的错误倾向，把坚定正确的政治方向放在首位，重点改善和净化中小学的育人环境，把思想政治工作落到实处。
    近几个月来，乳山县教育部门采取学习会、研讨会等形式，组织教师、教育政工干部进行反思，通过讨论和对比分析，认识到近几年来中小学内部普遍存在着重视灌输知识，轻视思想政治教育的倾向。同时，学校思想政治工作队伍有所削弱，部分师生思想混乱。为了改变中小学思想政治工作的被动局面，他们重点在改善育人环境上做文章。
    这个县全面加强教师队伍的思想建设，全县中小学普遍组织教师进行学习，提高他们的政治素质，使各科教师都能把政治思想教育同教学工作结合在一起去抓。另一方面教育主管部门和各学校对教师提出了全面要求，对教师工作的评估既考虑业务标准，又重视政治标准。
    同时，建立健全学校、社会、家庭三结合的教育网络，把学生的思想政治工作扩大到社会，深入到家庭。全县中小学普遍推行家长联系制度，教师定期家访并召开家长会议。同时，在学生居住区建立校外教育联络点，成立“少年之家”，聘请干部、工人和对子女教育有方的家长担任辅导员。
