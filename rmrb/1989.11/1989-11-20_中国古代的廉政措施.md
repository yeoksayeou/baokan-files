In the long history of ancient China, there were several noteworthy progressive measures, one of which was "clean governance." It is true that the fundamental contradiction between the exploiting class and the exploited class persisted throughout Chinese history, and this contradiction could not be fundamentally resolved through so-called "clean governance" measures. Moreover, due to the nature of the exploiting class, many officials inevitably succumbed to greed like moths to a flame. On the other hand, throughout the various dynasties, not only were the "supreme" emperors exempt from punishment, but many royal relatives, high-ranking officials, and powerful figures, even if they were accused of corruption, were often exempted or had their crimes mitigated due to laws such as the "eight exemptions" and "official compensation." Therefore, fundamentally speaking, ancient anti-corruption measures were often ineffective, and the practice of "supporting clean governance" was more about "supporting" than "clean governance." However, many rulers' measures to promote clean governance and punish corruption were, to a certain extent, a form of "good governance" that went beyond the narrow interests of their own camp, reducing the exploitation of the people, promoting social stability, and aiding the recovery and development of productive forces, thus having a certain progressive significance in history.

The content of ancient clean governance is extensive. The key points can be summarized into at least six aspects:

1. **Appointment Based on Integrity.** "Integrity" has always been a standard for selecting and appointing officials in ancient dynasties. During the Warring States period, Han Fei, who proposed "recommending relatives without avoiding kinship, and recommending outsiders without avoiding enmity," advocated that such "recommendations" should be based on whether the person is upright and honest. The Qin Dynasty even legally stipulated that the way of being an official must be "clean and impartial." The Western Han Dynasty's Emperor Wu and Emperor Wen frequently issued edicts recommending "honest officials," stating that "honest officials are the model for the people," and thus "valuing integrity and despising corruption." The Eastern Han Dynasty continued the practice of selecting honest officials, with over 40,000 people selected as "filial and honest." The Wei and Jin Dynasties used the Nine-Rank System to select officials, emphasizing that the selected person must be "pure in conduct and modest." From the Sui and Tang Dynasties to the late Qing Dynasty, the imperial examination system was the main route for selecting officials, but within the imperial examinations, there was a category for "filial piety, integrity, and humility," and the appointment of officials emphasized "clean governance and integrity." From the Qin Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, there were almost always penalties for "appointing unqualified people" or "recommending unqualified candidates," and "lack of integrity" and "impurity" were important contents of these penalties.

2. **Supervision Based on Integrity.** The supervision of officials began as early as the Zhou Dynasty. The Western Han Dynasty's Emperor Hui and Emperor Wu issued the "Nine Articles for Supervisors" and the "Six Articles for Inspectors," formally including "officials not being honest" and "turning public affairs into private gains" as contents of supervision. Emperor Wu of the Jin Dynasty not only established laws for "inspecting prefectures" and "inspecting high officials," emphasizing that prefectural officials and high officials must first be "upright" and "honest," but also stipulated that they must "expose their impurities" and "report their honesty." The Sui Dynasty's "Six Articles for the Metropolitan Commandant" and the Tang Dynasty's "Six Articles for Inspecting Prefectures" both placed "inspecting officials' cruelty and harm to politics" and "officials' good and bad conduct" at the forefront. The Song Dynasty's "Regulations of the Xingyuan Period" had edicts for strictly inspecting corrupt officials and decrees for severely punishing those who "accepted bribes." The Yuan Dynasty's "Thirty-Six Articles for the Censorate" required censors to "report rewards for honest officials and expose corrupt officials," clearly stating that officials who "bought goods at low prices," "appropriated official property," or "received money and goods" were all subject to exposure. The early Ming Dynasty's "Regulations on the Responsibilities of Officials" stipulated that the Censorate must report to the emperor if it discovered corruption by prefectural officials, and the Censorate's duties also included exposing "corrupt and dishonest officials who violated official ethics." The Qing Dynasty not only stipulated that the duties of governors and governors-general included "exposing major corrupt officials," but also included governors and governors-general among those who were demoted and beheaded for corruption.

3. **Performance Evaluation Based on Integrity.** The honesty or dishonesty of officials has been a part of performance evaluations since ancient times. "Dying for wealth" was one of the "three evils" and "ten crimes" of the Shang Dynasty. "Honesty and goodness" and "honesty and uprightness" were also included in the "six evaluations" of the Zhou Dynasty. The Qin Dynasty evaluated "five virtues," one of which was "honesty and no slander." The Han Dynasty implemented "honest inspections," and the Jin Dynasty's evaluations emphasized "upright conduct" and "public modesty" first. Emperor Wu of the Jin Dynasty opposed officials who "did not establish public integrity while private wealth increased daily," and Emperor Yuan of the Jin Dynasty called on officials to "mutually inspect," causing some corrupt officials to "retreat upon hearing the wind." The Tang Dynasty implemented the "Four Virtues and Twenty-Seven Best Performance Evaluation System" for internal officials, with "clean and cautious" being one of the four virtues and "promoting honesty and eliminating corruption" being one of the twenty-seven best performances; for external officials, the "Four-Level Performance Evaluation System" was implemented, with "clean, cautious, diligent, and public-spirited" at the top and "corrupt and impure" at the bottom. The Song Dynasty had regulations for "rewards and demotions," as well as "three evaluations for prefectures and counties," rewarding "officials who were honest and diligent" and demoting "corrupt and dishonest officials." The Ming Dynasty implemented the "eight methods of performance evaluation," with "corruption" and "cruelty" at the top and second. The early Qing Dynasty followed this, but starting from the fourth year of the Qianlong reign (1739), the reporting of corruption and cruelty was no longer limited to once every three years but became a "regular matter."

4. **Avoidance for Integrity.** The ancient system of "avoidance" not only appeared in judicial trials but also in the selection and evaluation of officials. The Song Dynasty's measure for clean governance was that prefectures, prefectural cities, military regions, and surveillance commissions could not appoint local people. The early Ming Dynasty's principle for appointing officials was that "southerners should not be officials in the north, and northerners should not be officials in the south." The Ming Dynasty stipulated that people from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Suzhou, and Songjiang could not be officials in the Ministry of Revenue, governors could not inspect their own provinces, and educational officials could not be selected from their own counties. The Qing Dynasty also inherited and developed this, clearly stipulating "avoiding hometowns" in recommendations, "avoiding relatives" in imperial examinations, and "avoiding native places" in appointments. In addition to stipulating that the nine ministers could not recommend officials of the same level and from the same province, and that examiners must recuse themselves if any relatives were taking the exam, it was further stipulated: "Officials serving outside the capital within 500 li must recuse themselves," and "within 500 li, even if the provinces are different, recusal is still required." In the late Qing Dynasty, it was further ordered that prefectural secretaries, county magistrates, county sub-prefects, county clerks, patrol inspectors, and sub-prefects "could not serve in their own counties or within 300 li of their native places." This avoidance system, to a certain extent, prevented officials from forming networks of influence and committing favoritism.

5. **Salaries for Integrity.** The corruption of ancient officials was mainly determined by their nature as the exploiting class and their lack of self-cultivation, but sometimes it was also related to insufficient salaries. In the early Northern Wei Dynasty, there were no salaries, and there were many corrupt officials. After Emperor Xiaowen of the Northern Wei Dynasty issued the salary system and anti-corruption laws, corrupt officials significantly decreased. The salaries of Ming Dynasty officials were low, with a first-rank official's monthly salary of less than 22 taels of silver, so the trend of corruption became severe in the mid-Ming Dynasty, especially in the Ministries of Personnel and War. The salaries of early Qing Dynasty officials were also low, and there were many "irregular fees." In the 12th year of the Yongzheng reign (1734), the "salary for clean governance" system was implemented, and officials' salaries far exceeded their "regular salaries," temporarily weakening the trend of corruption. During the reign of Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, the middle secretary High Jifu once wrote: "If one does not relieve the officials' poverty, only desires their diligence and cleanliness, it is feared that... they cannot prevent their encroachment."

6. **Severe Punishments for Corruption.** Ancient dynasties not only imposed fines, restitution, demotion, transfer, and dismissal on corrupt officials but also mostly used severe punishments. The Shang Dynasty used "tattooing"; the Qin Dynasty used "tattooing on the face," and even stipulated that officials who embezzled public funds should be punished according to the law for "thieves." The Western Han Dynasty stipulated that officials who accepted bribes and perverted justice should all be "executed in the marketplace"; the Northern Qi Dynasty's Zuo Si was executed for corruption. Executing corrupt officials was formally written into the law during the Tang Dynasty. "Accepting one sheep or one jar of wine" was a capital offense, as stipulated by Emperor Xiaowen of the Northern Wei Dynasty; displaying the heads of corrupt officials and skinning them as a warning was one of the punishments in Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty's "Awakening Corruption Simple Records." The Qing Dynasty also had the punishment of "ordering suicide." In addition to the above capital punishments, various dynasties also implemented punishments of flogging, caning, imprisonment, and exile. The Ming Dynasty also had punishments of exposing to the emperor, cutting off fingers, amputating feet, shaving heads, and tattooing. "Killing without distinguishing between heavy and light crimes" was an order of the early Ming Dynasty; and "imposing multiple punishments on one person" was practiced in many dynasties.

Ancient anti-corruption measures, while paying attention to "sentencing according to the law" and "sentencing according to the amount of embezzlement," sometimes resulted in overly severe punishments, and the methods of punishment were somewhat barbaric, used to maintain their autocratic rule and social stability. In fact, the rampant corruption of officials in the feudal system often acted as a catalyst and accelerator for peasant uprisings. Therefore, the "rulers with achievements" of various dynasties, in order to maintain their "long-term stability," in addition to implementing certain other measures, had to severely punish corruption.

    中国古代的廉政措施
    夏家骏
    在漫长的中国古代史中，颇有一些值得注意的进步措施，“廉政”便是其一。诚然，在中国古代，剥削阶级与被剥削阶级的根本矛盾始终存在，根本无法通过所谓“廉政”措施彻底解决；而由剥削阶级的阶级本性决定，许多官吏也必然有如飞蛾扑火一样根本无法斩除贪心；另一方面，历代各朝，不仅“至高无上”的皇帝不在被惩之列，而且许多的皇亲国戚、勋臣要员即使贪赃被参也因有“八议”、“官当”之律而被豁免或抵消其罪，因此，从根本上说，古代的惩贪不过是屡惩屡贪，养廉实质上也是养而难廉。然而，历代许多统治者的倡廉惩贪措施，毕竟是超出自己营垒中那些贪得无厌的近视眼蠹虫们的一种“善政”，起过一定程度的减轻对人民的剥削、有利于社会安定、有利于生产力的恢复发展，在历史上具有一定的进步意义。
    古代的廉政，内容甚多。撮其要者，至少有以下六个方面：
    一、任选以廉。“廉洁”与否，历来是古代各朝选拔任用官吏的标准之一。战国时期提出“内举不避亲，外举不避仇”的韩非，即主张这种“举”，应以是非廉洁为前提，“是”即“廉”、“廉”则“誉”，“非”即“贪”、“贪”则“罚”。秦朝更以法律的形式明确规定：为吏之道，必清廉无私，“廉而勿刖”。西汉武帝、文帝，也频诏荐举“廉吏”；声称“廉吏，民之表也”，因而“贵廉洁、贱贪污”。东汉朝廷，仍行选廉之制，仅其所选“孝廉”即达四万余人。魏晋以九品中正制选官，虽重门阀，然也规定其人须“洁身劳谦”。隋唐直至清末，选官以科举为正途，但科举中既有“孝悌廉让”一科，任人又提倡“清廉守节”。而自秦至清，几乎历代还有对于“任人不善”或“贡举非人”者的惩罚规定，这“不善”与“非人”之中，“不廉”、“不洁”也是一项重要的内容。
    二、监察以廉。对官吏实行监察，在周朝即已形成制度；而西汉惠帝、武帝颁定的《监御史九条》、《刺史诏六条》，更正式将“吏不廉”“倍（背）公向私”等作为监察的内容了。晋武帝不仅制定了“察郡”、“察长吏”的律条，强调郡官、长吏首要“正身”、“公廉”，而且规定必须“纠其秽浊”、“举其公清”。隋之《司隶六条》、唐之《六条察郡》，均将“察官人贪残害政”、“官人之善恶”放在前列。宋之《庆元条法事类》中有严察赃吏之诏，又有严惩“受例外供馈”之敕。元朝所颁《台纲三十六条》，要求御史“奏赏廉能，纠劾污滥”，明定“贱买诸物”、“侵易官物”、“乞受钱物”的官吏均在纠劾之列。明初的《百官责任条例》，规定布政司发现府官贪污，必须随时“奏闻提问”；而其都察院之职，也应纠劾百官中的“贪冒坏官纪者”。清朝不仅规定总督、巡抚职掌之一是“纠参大贪”，而且包括总督、巡抚在内的一、二品大员之因贪污被革职问斩者亦不乏其人。
    三、考核以廉。官吏的贪、廉，很早即被列为考核内容。“殉于货色”，是商朝的“三风”、“十罪”之一。“廉善”、“廉正”，则又列于周朝的“六计”之中。秦考“五善”，五善之一是“清廉无谤”。两汉实行“廉察”，晋朝考核更以“正身”、“公谦”为首。晋武帝反对官吏“公节不立而私门日富”，晋元帝则号召官吏互相“检察”，致使一些贪官“皆望风自引去”。唐朝对内流官行“四善二十七最考课法”，“清慎明著”为四善之一，“扬清激浊”为二十七最之一；对流外官行“四等第考课法”，首为“清谨勤公”，末为“贪浊有状”。宋朝定有“旌赏”、“贬斥”之条，又有“州县三课”，旌赏“居官廉恪”，贬斥“贪冒无状”。明朝实行考核“八法”，而“贪”、“酷”列于首、次。清初沿之，但乾隆四年（1739年）起，贪、酷的参劾不许三年一次，而改为“经常之事”了。
    四、回避为廉。古代的“回避”之制，不仅表现于司法审判之中，而且表现于选派官吏、考核官吏之上。州、府、军、监不得以本地人充任，是宋朝的廉政措施；“南人官北、北人官南”，更是明初的任官原则。明朝规定的浙、赣、苏、松人不得任官于户部，巡抚不巡于本省，学官不选任于本郡。清朝亦多所承袭而又有发展，并明确规定了荐举中“避乡”、科举中“避亲”、任官中“避籍”。除规定九卿不得保举同级本省官，考场如有任何亲戚赶考，考官概令回避之外，还进一步规定：“外任官在本级五百里以内者回避”，“五百里内者，省有别，仍应回避”；清末更明令府经历、县丞、州吏目、县主簿、巡检、典史也“不得在本州、本县及距离本籍三百里以内当差”。这种回避制度，在一定程度上防止了官吏们的盘根错节和徇情枉法。
    五、俸养为廉。古代贪官之贪，主要决定于其剥削阶级本性和自我修养的不足，但有时也与俸饷不足有关。北魏初无俸禄，贪官甚多，孝文帝颁定俸禄制和惩贪律后，贪官才大为减少。明朝官俸薄，一品大员每月俸米折银不足二十二两，故中叶后贪风大炽，吏、兵二部尤其严重。清初官俸也少，“陋规”就多。雍正十二年（1734年）实行“养廉钱”制，官员恩俸大大超过“正俸”，贪风即一度削弱。唐太宗时的中书舍人高季辅曾上书讲：“若不恤其（官员）匮乏，唯欲责其清勤，止恐……不能肃其侵渔。”这话并非完全为古代官吏的贪索开脱罪责。
    六、重刑惩贪。古代各朝对于贪官，不仅施行过罚款、追赔、革职留任、降调、削职为民等经济和行政的处罚，而且大多采用重刑惩治。商朝采用过“墨刑”；秦朝采用过“黥刑”，甚至规定贪污公款“与‘盗’同法。”西汉规定：官吏受贿枉法等统统“弃市”；北齐祖珽贪污被“处绞”；绞死贪官，在唐朝正式写进法律。“受羊一口、酒一斛者”大辟，是北魏孝文帝所定；将贪官“枭首示众仍剥皮”示警，乃明太祖朱元璋《醒贪简要录》中之一刑。清朝惩贪，还有“赐令自尽”之法。上述死刑之外，历代还行笞、杖、徒、流之刑，明朝又有挑君、剁指、刖足、髠发、文身之惩。“不分轻重皆杀”，是明初之令；而“一身加数刑”，则不少朝代皆而有之。
    古代惩贪之法，虽也注意“依条科断”和“计赃科断”，注意根据不同情节量刑，但总的说来有时失之过重，处刑的手段也有些野蛮，以此维持他们的专制统治和社会的稳定。事实也证明：在封建制度下贪官污吏的横行，往往是农民起义爆发的催化剂和加速器。因此，各朝的“有为之君”，为了维护自己的“久安长治”，除了实行某些其他措施，也非重刑惩贪不可。
