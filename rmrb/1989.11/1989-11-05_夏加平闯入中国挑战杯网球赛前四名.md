Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 3rd.

Chinese player Xia Jiaoping became the headline news of the 1989 China Challenge Cup International Tennis Tournament today. In the men's singles round of 16, he defeated Japanese player Tsuchi Hashi Junichiku with a score of 7:6 (7:2), 6:4, advancing to the semifinals.

This is another outstanding achievement by Chinese tennis players in an international tennis grand prix.

The 20-year-old Xia Jiaoping started the match with a powerful strategy—using forehand and backhand cross-court kills followed by net play. He quickly took a 2:0 lead. Then, his opponent, known for his powerful and cunning baseline shots, engaged in a fierce rally with Xia Jiaoping, who is known for his speed and agility. The score went back and forth until it was tied at 6:6. In the tiebreaker, Xia Jiaoping finally won 7:2 to secure the first set.

In the second set, Xia Jiaoping continued to use varied shot placements to move his opponent around, while seizing opportunities to aggressively approach the net, causing the Japanese amateur champion Tsuchi Hashi Junichiku to make frequent errors. Xia Jiaoping maintained his lead throughout the set, ultimately winning 6:4.

Xia Jiaoping's victory raised his ranking in the International Tennis Federation from over 700th to over 500th.

The other three players who advanced to the semifinals are Hacknis (USA), Bruce (New Zealand), and Kim Bong-su (South Korea).

In the men's doubles round of 16, China's Liu Shuhua and Pan Bing won the first set and then advanced to the semifinals after their opponents withdrew.

China's other two pairs, Dai Xidong/Liu Xiaocheng and Meng Qianghua/Wang Yue, lost to Fernandez (Mexico)/Ramos (Haiti) and Bruce (New Zealand)/Ali (India) with scores of 0:2 and 1:2, respectively.

    夏加平闯入中国挑战杯网球赛前四名
    新华社北京11月3日电  （记者梁金雄）中国选手夏加平今天成为1989年中国挑战杯国际网球赛的头号新闻人物。他在男单复赛中，以7∶6（7∶2）、6∶4淘汰了日本好手土桥澄之久，闯入半决赛。
    这是我国网球赛健儿在国际网球大奖赛中取得的又一突出战绩。
    20岁的夏加平开场就使出绝招——正反手斜线抽杀接上网，很快以2∶0领先。接着，对手以其凶猛刁钻的底线球与“快、灵”见长的夏加平展开对攻，双方从2平战至6平。在决胜局中，夏加平终以7∶2取得首盘胜利。
    第二盘，夏加平还是坚持以多变的球路落点调动对手，同时伺机果敢上网，使日本业余冠军土桥澄之久频频失误。夏加平一路领先，最后以6∶4战胜对手。
    夏加平的胜利使他在国际网联排名表中，从700余位一下跃到500余位。
    获得半决赛权的其他三名选手是哈克尼斯（美国）、布鲁斯（新西兰）和金奉洙（南朝鲜）。
    在男双复赛中，中国的刘树华／潘兵首盘赢得1局后，因对手弃权，轻松进入半决赛。
    我国另两对选手戴曦东／刘晓成和孟强华／王越分别以0∶2和1∶2负于费尔南德斯（墨西哥）／拉莫斯（海地）和布鲁斯（新西兰）／阿里（印度）。
