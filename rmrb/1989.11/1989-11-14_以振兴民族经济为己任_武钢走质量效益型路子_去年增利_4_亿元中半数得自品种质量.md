Wuhan Steel Corporation has pioneered a quality-efficiency development path. Authoritative figures have pointed out that Wuhan Steel's development path aligns with the socialist direction and will have a significant impact on the development of other industries, particularly large enterprises.

Seven years ago, Wuhan Steel's production was 2.76 million tons, with 267,000 tons of defective products, accounting for approximately 10%. The quality issue severely plagued this large-scale integrated enterprise. In 1983, the company and its various factories and mines established quality management committees led by the managers (factory directors). That year, they proposed to "reduce defects by half" and focused on the foundation, quality management, and technical breakthroughs. By the end of the year, the results were significant, with 140,000 tons of defects reduced. Now, with production doubled, defects have been reduced to 70,000 tons.

Wuhan Steel's steel products are mainly allocated by the state plan and are in short supply. In the past few years, market competition pressure was not significant. As long as production was increased, the maximum economic benefit could be achieved. However, Wuhan Steel considered not only its own interests but also the responsibility of a national key enterprise to revitalize the national economy. The company's benefits and social benefits were unified. Thus, it chose the quality-efficiency development path.

In 1985, Wuhan Steel proposed "two shifts": shifting production focus from quantity to quality, and shifting management focus from economic responsibility to comprehensive quality management. The company also established a "one-stop" quality assurance system with high-quality products as the leader, organizing all related processes and departments from the entry of raw materials to the exit of finished products, forming a clear-tiered, responsible network. Each level established quality contracts, linking quality with total wages. The entire enterprise, process, and personnel participated in comprehensive quality management, creating a new enterprise culture: quality first.

By persistently focusing on quality, Wuhan Steel gradually overcame its difficulties. From 1983 to 1988, product quality improved steadily by 100% each year, achieving 13 national awards (3 gold medals, 10 silver medals), 27 ministry and provincial awards, and a high-quality product output value rate of 69.9%. Currently, Wuhan Steel is striving to meet international standards. In 1988, all technical standards were revised and improved. Steel products produced according to international standards accounted for 85% of the total steel output. These high-quality products largely replaced imports, saving the country tens of billions of dollars in foreign exchange.

Focusing on quality brings economic benefits. Over the past decade, Wuhan Steel's production, output value, and labor productivity have all doubled, while profits and taxes have quadrupled, increasing at an annual rate of 24.6%. Last year, Wuhan Steel's increased profit of 400 million yuan, with 220 million yuan directly from product variety and quality.

    以振兴民族经济为己任
    武钢走质量效益型路子
    去年增利4亿元中半数得自品种质量
    本报武汉11月13日电　记者龚达发报道：武汉钢铁公司率先开拓出一条质量效益型发展路子。权威人士指出，武钢的发展路子符合社会主义方向，将对其他行业尤其是大型企业的发展产生举足轻重的影响。
    7年前的武钢，产量为276万吨，废品就有26.7万吨，约占10％。质量问题严重困扰着这家特大型联合企业。1983年，公司和各厂矿相继成立以经理（厂长）为首的质量管理委员会，当年提出“废品减半”，并围绕这一目标抓基础、抓质量管理、抓技术攻关，年终成效显著，废品减少14万吨。到现在产量翻了一番，而废品却降到7万吨。
    武钢生产的钢材，大都是国家计划分配的紧俏物资。前几年，市场竞争压力不大，只要把产量抓上去，就可获得最大的经济效益。但武钢想到的不只是自身的利益，而是国家骨干企业对振兴民族经济的责任，企业效益与社会效益的统一。于是，选择了质量效益型的发展路子。
    1985年，武钢提出了“两个转移”：抓生产由以产量为中心转向以质量为中心，抓管理由以经济责任制为中心转向以全面质量管理为中心。公司还建立了以优质产品为龙头的“一条龙”质量保证体系，把产品从原材料进厂到成品出厂的所有相关工序、部门组织起来，形成一个层次分明，责任明确的网络，层层建立质量承包，实行质量与工资总额紧密挂钩。全企业、全过程、全员参加的全面质量管理，造就了崭新的企业文化：质量优先。
    坚持不懈抓质量，武钢一步步走出困境。1983年至1988年，连续6年产品质量稳定提高率达100％，创出13个国优（3个金牌，10个银牌），27个部优、省优，优质产品产值率达69.9％。现在，武钢正在全力以赴向国际标准冲刺。1988年对所有技术标准进行了修订和完善，按国际标准生产的钢材已占钢材总产量的85％，这些优质产品大部分替代了进口，为国家节省外汇几十亿美元。
    抓质量带来经济效益。10年来武钢产量、产值、劳动生产率都提高了一倍，而利税却翻了两番，每年以24.6％的速度递增。去年武钢增利4亿元中，直接来自品种质量的就有2.2亿元。
