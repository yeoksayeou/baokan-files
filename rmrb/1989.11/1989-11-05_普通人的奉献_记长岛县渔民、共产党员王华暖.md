	Ordinary People's Dedication
	— A Record of Long Island County Fisherman and Communist Party Member Wang Huawan
	By People's Daily reporter Lü Jiānzhōng

	He does not have any spectacular achievements, but what is rare is that he has been diligently working and selflessly dedicating himself for decades, earning the praise of the people.

	He is an old fisherman from Dangji Town in Long Island County, Shandong, an ordinary Communist Party member — Wang Huawan.

	In the autumn of 1949, Long Island was liberated, and Wang Huawan became the master of the sea. He was the first to organize a fleet of 14 households. Every time they went out to sea, they always returned with a full catch, attracting fishermen from the village and town. His fleet never kept the discovery of large schools of fish a secret but instead promptly reported it to the village and town, allowing everyone to share in the joy of the harvest.

	After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, the people of Long Island embarked on the path to prosperity. However, in recent years, the island has seen a trend of individuals pursuing personal wealth at the expense of national and collective interests. Wang Huawan educated his crew, saying, "People should not forget their roots. Without the Party's good policies and the support of the state, how could we poor fishermen have our present day?" His fleet pays taxes to the state annually and contributes to the collective. When the island built a martyrs' cemetery and developed education and welfare, he donated generously on multiple occasions. During every festival, his fleet would select the best fresh fish to comfort the troops stationed on the island. In just the past five years, they have sent nearly 20,000 pounds of "support-the-army fish." When the village needed funds to develop sideline production, he repeatedly provided assistance and led the village's party members to raise tens of millions of yuan to help the collective establish a mink farm and develop aquaculture. In 1987, when the village developed scallop farming, it urgently needed to drive piles in the seabed at a depth of over 30 meters. Wang Huawan rolled up his sleeves and worked with his crew all night to repair old machinery for their own use, replacing the main engine of the ship for the village to use for piling, and drove another ship to transport materials to the village free of charge. His fleet thus lost 200,000 yuan in income, but the village-run enterprise increased its revenue by over 600,000 yuan.

	Wang Huawan generously dedicates himself to the state and the collective, while he himself always maintains a spirit of hard work and self-reliance. In recent years, while Dangji Island has built row after row of new-style fisherman's residential buildings, Wang Huawan still lives in an old flat with walls full of awards. He said, "All I want in life is to be a qualified Communist Party member."

    普通人的奉献
    ——记长岛县渔民、共产党员王华暖
    本报记者　吕建中
    他没有轰轰烈烈的事迹，难能可贵的是他数十年如一日，埋头苦干，无私奉献，赢得人们的同声赞誉。
    他就是山东长岛县砣矶镇上的老渔民，一个普通的共产党员——王华暖。
    1949年秋长岛解放了，王华暖成了大海的主人。他率先组织一个14户的船队，每次出海作业，总是满载而归，吸引着村镇上的渔民。他的船队每发现大鱼群从不保密，而是及时向村镇上报告，让大家共享丰收的喜悦。
    党的十一届三中全会以后，长岛人踏上致富之路。但近几年岛上却滋长着只顾个人发家致富不惜损害国家和集体利益的倾向。王华暖教育船员说：“人不能忘本，没有党的好政策，没有国家的扶持，哪有咱穷渔民的今天？”他的船队年年照章向国家纳税，向集体上交提留。岛上建烈士陵园，办教育和福利事业，他多次慷慨捐款。每逢年节，他的船队必挑选最好的鲜鱼慰劳岛上驻军，仅最近5年间就送了近两万斤“拥军鱼”。村里发展副业生产缺资金，他一再资助，并带动全村党员集资几十万元帮助集体办起了养貂厂和发展水产养殖。1987年村里发展扇贝养殖，急需在30多米深的海底打桩，王华暖挽起袖子和船员们一起连夜修好旧机器自用，换下船上的主机给村上打桩使用，又驾驶另一只船无偿为村里到外地运回器材。他的船队因此减少2万元收入，而村办企业却增收60多万元。
    王华暖对国家、对集体慷慨奉献，而他本人，则始终保持着艰苦奋斗的本色。近几年砣矶岛建起一排排新式渔民住宅小楼，而王华暖仍然住在四壁挂满奖状的旧平房里。他说：“我一生不求别的，只求作一个合格的共产党员。”
