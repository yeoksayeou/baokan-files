The China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation and the Navy Equipment Technology Department recently jointly issued a notice to commend eight military-civilian jointly built advanced units in the Wanzhou region of Sichuan Province.

These advanced units' workers and military representatives have long been working in the remote, water-scarce, and power-deficient mountains and gorges of eastern Sichuan. They have established a new type of military-civilian relationship of mutual assistance and shared hardships in these harsh conditions. They have not only produced high-quality products but also cultivated a military-industrial workforce that is strong in ideology, technology, and style. This has driven the continuous development of the enterprises' economic and social benefits. The total industrial output value of the eight advanced military-civilian jointly built factories has nearly doubled compared to ten years ago. Nineteen of their products have won national or provincial and ministerial-level awards, and seven have filled domestic gaps. Many of their products have participated in major scientific experiments such as intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine underwater-launched carrier rockets, and synchronous satellite launches, and have been commended by the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission.

    中国船舶工业总公司  海军装备技术部表彰军民共建军工企业
    新华社成都11月7日电  （记者黄彩虹）中国船舶工业总公司和海军装备技术部日前联合发出通报，表彰四川省万县地区军工企业8个军民共建先进单位。
    这些先进单位的职工和军代表长年工作在交通闭塞、用水困难、供电不足的川东群山峡谷之中。他们在艰苦的环境中建立了同舟共济、患难与共的新型军民关系，既创出了优质产品，又培养了思想、技术、作风都过得硬的军工队伍，推动了企业经济和社会效益不断发展。8个军民共建先进厂的工业总产值比10年前翻了近两番，有19项产品获得国家或省、部级奖，有7项填补了国内空白。不少产品参加过洲际导弹、潜艇水下发射运载火箭、同步卫星发射等重大科学试验任务，受到党中央、国务院和中央军委的表彰。
