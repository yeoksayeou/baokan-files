Transportation difficulties constrain economic development, and we have a deep understanding of this. Guizhou Province has 87% of its total area consisting of plateaus and mountains. In the old China, such natural geographical conditions made it extremely difficult to develop transportation. After liberation, Guizhou's transportation industry has made some progress, but due to a long period of insufficient recognition of the leading role of transportation in the national economy, the development speed of transportation has been significantly lower than that of industry and agriculture. For example, from the "First Five-Year Plan" to the "Fifth Five-Year Plan," the total investment in industrial and agricultural construction in the province increased by 33 times, while transportation (including postal services) only increased by 1.7 times.

The Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee was held, and the winds of reform and opening up swept across the motherland. When we look back at the path we have taken, we realize that Guizhou, especially the remote ethnic minority areas, has not yet emerged from the closed mountain agricultural economy. Guizhou has abundant mineral resources (15 types of minerals with proven reserves ranking in the top five nationwide, including mercury, phosphorus, coal, antimony, and aluminum) and other natural resources. Converting resource advantages into commodity advantages is a major shortcut for Guizhou to develop a commodity economy and for the people to get out of poverty quickly.

"We cannot sit on a mountain of gold and beg for food." After repeated deliberations and considerations, combined with the actual situation of our province: railways and civil aviation mainly rely on central arrangements; road transportation accounts for more than 80% of the province's passenger and cargo transportation; the mountainous water resources are abundant, with the Wujiang and Qingshui Rivers in the north connecting to the Yangtze River, and the Nanpan, Beipan, and Hongshui Rivers in the south connecting to the Pearl River. After dredging, they will be excellent waterways for exiting the province. Therefore, the provincial "Seventh Five-Year Plan" for transportation focuses on road construction and the development of inland waterways.

When specific plans were being formulated, the demand for road construction and river dredging was extremely urgent in various cities and counties, but investment was limited, and the province could not afford more funds. How to resolve this contradiction? Our approach was to prioritize key roads in the plan and formulate policies to support them, using limited funds effectively. In road and river construction, we explored the path of "national subsidies, mainly relying on local and county governments to build transportation." Under the care of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, from 1984 to 1987, our province, through national subsidies of grain, cotton, and cloth, and through labor in exchange for public works, built and renovated 6,097 kilometers of roads, completed 404 bridges totaling 12,820 meters, and completed 13 large and small river navigation projects. The "Seventh Five-Year Plan" was realized, and five key roads in our province were completed and opened to traffic, further improving the road transportation conditions. With the development of transportation, in 1988, the industrial and agricultural output value of our province reached 23.726 billion yuan, township enterprises developed significantly, and farmers' per capita net income increased from 109.3 yuan in 1978 to 397.7 yuan in 1988. Practice tells us that the economy must develop, and transportation must take the lead; for underdeveloped regions, in addition to national financial support, an important condition for the relatively rapid development of transportation is to provide more policy support.

Compared to the rest of the country, Guizhou is in the "third world." To further develop the Guizhou economy, we recently invited some foreign investors. They saw that Guizhou has abundant resources, beautiful mountains and rivers, and a pleasant climate, and they felt quite good. However, because modern transportation is not developed, many expressed intentions, but few actually invested. The passive situation of "production and sales determined by transportation" for mineral resource development has not been reversed. In the "Eighth Five-Year Plan," we will continue to focus on developing transportation, but the contradiction of weak economic foundation and insufficient funds in our province remains prominent. We plan to adopt the method of raising funds from multiple sources to supplement part of it, and we plan to further improve and formulate some new policies from the policy aspect to promote transportation construction through preferential policies. However, some issues cannot be decided by the province, such as the road maintenance fees used for road maintenance in our province, which are already insufficient. If we extract the energy transportation construction fund and the national budget adjustment fund from it, the shortage of road maintenance fees will be even greater. Can we consider exempting the "two funds"? We hope that the state will continue to adopt a subsidy policy to help remote ethnic minority areas develop transportation. This will be more conducive to changing the backward transportation conditions in underdeveloped regions and implementing Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions to "strengthen the foundation industries, build more railways, roads, and shipping, and do many things" and implement the new industrial tilt policy recently formulated by the State Council.

### 用优惠政策促进交通建设

　　用优惠政策促进交通建设
　　贵州省省长　王朝文
    交通不便制约经济发展，我们深有体会。贵州省总面积的87％是高原、山地。在旧中国，如此的自然地理条件，发展交通“难于上青天”。解放以后，贵州交通事业有了一定发展，但由于较长一段时间对交通运输在国民经济中的先行地位认识不足，交通运输的发展速度明显低于工农业发展速度。以基本建设投资为例，“一五”到“五五”时期，全省工农业基建投资增长了33倍，而交通（包括邮电）只增长了1.7倍。
    十一届三中全会召开，改革开放的春风吹拂祖国大地。当我们回过头来审视走过的路时，才发现贵州特别是边远少数民族地方，尚未走出封闭的山区农业经济形态。贵州有丰富的矿产资源（已探明储量居全国前5位的就有汞、磷、煤、锑、铝等15种）和其他自然资源。将资源优势转换为商品优势，是贵州发展商品经济，人民较快脱贫的一大捷径。
      “不能坐在金山上讨饭吃”。经过反复论证、权衡，结合我省现实情况：铁路、民航主要靠中央安排；公路运输承担了全省客、货运输量的80％以上；山区水利资源丰富，北有乌江、赤水河通长江，南边南、北盘江、红水河可通珠江，航道经整治，将是很好的水上出省通道。因此，省“七五”交通规划重点是公路建设和内河航运开发。
    具体拟订计划时，各地、县要求修路和整治航道的心情极为迫切，投资有限，本省限于财力又拿不出更多资金。如何解决这一矛盾？我们的做法是对重点公路在计划上优先安排，制订政策予以扶持，将有限的资金用在刀刃上。在公路、内河建设上，探索出了“国家适当资助，主要依靠地、县办交通”的路子。在党中央、国务院的关怀下，1984至1987年，我省通过国家补助粮棉布以工代赈新、改建公路6097公里，建成桥梁404座12820延米，内河航运完成大小工程项目13个。“七五”计划实现，我省新、改建的五条重点公路建成通车，公路交通条件将得到进一步改善。交通发展的同时，1988年我省的工农业产值达到237.26亿元，乡镇企业有了很大发展，农民人均纯收入由1978年的109.3元增至1988年的397.7元。实践告诉我们，经济要发展，交通应先行；贫困地区的交通要得到较快发展，国家除了在资金上支持外，一个很重要的条件在于要多从政策上予以扶持。
    与全国比较，贵州属“第三世界”。为进一步开发贵州经济，最近我们曾请了一些外商来，他们看到贵州资源丰富、山青水秀、气候宜人，感觉很不错，但就是因为现代交通工具不发达，谈意向的多，具体落实投资的少。矿产资源开发以运定产、以运定销的被动局面还未扭转。“八五”规划，大力发展交通仍是我们的工作重点，只是本省经济基础薄弱，资金不足的矛盾仍很突出。我们准备采取多方集资的办法补充部分，准备再从政策方面作些补充完善和制定些新的政策，用优惠政策促进交通建设。但有的问题不是省里可以决定的，如养路费用于本省公路养护已是捉襟见肘，再从中提取能源交通建设基金和国家预算调节基金，使已经不足的养路费用缺口更大，可否考虑免征“两基金”？希望国家继续采取补助的政策，帮助边远少数民族发展交通。这样，将更有利于贫困地区改变落后的交通条件，有利于贯彻小平同志“要加强基础工业，多搞点铁路、公路、航运，能办很多事情”的指示和落实国务院新制定的产业倾斜政策。
