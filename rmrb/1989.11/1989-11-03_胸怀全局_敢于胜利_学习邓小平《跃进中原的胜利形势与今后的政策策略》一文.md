In February 1948, Deng Xiaoping, the First Secretary of the Central China Bureau of the Communist Party of China and the Political Commissar of the Central China Field Army, led part of the Liu-Deng Army out of the Dabie Mountains after successfully repelling the enemy's heavy encirclement. They then merged with Commander Liu Bocheng in Huabei and later joined the Chen-She Army in the liberated area of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei. On April 25, Deng Xiaoping convened a joint meeting of the front and rear commissions of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei in Lushan County, Henan Province. Attendees included Chen Geng, Xie Fuzhi, Qin Jiwei, Huang Zhen, Kong Congzhou, and Zhang Xie. At this meeting, Deng Xiaoping gave an important speech, which was later included in the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" as "The Victory Situation in the Advance into Central China and Future Policies and Strategies."

The spring of 1948 was a critical moment when the People's Liberation Army's strategic counteroffensive achieved decisive victories, and the Pingjin, Liao-Shen, and Huai-Hai campaigns were about to unfold. At this historical juncture, Deng Xiaoping, who was responsible for the command of the southern front, with a strategic vision and a broad perspective, summarized and analyzed the victory situation across the country and in Central China since the counteroffensive. He clearly proposed the future tasks. This speech is rich in profound thoughts. In particular, the viewpoints on embracing the big picture, shouldering heavy responsibilities, daring to struggle, and daring to win have significant importance for our current socialist modernization construction.

Embracing the strategic big picture and dialectically viewing the victory situation after the counteroffensive is an important content of this speech.

The Liu-Deng Army's advance into the Dabie Mountains, covering a thousand miles, achieved a strategic offensive, changed the national situation, and had far-reaching significance. Mao Zedong once gave it a high evaluation. However, if we only look at the Dabie Mountains as a single part, the situation at that time was extremely serious. Many comrades thus developed some erroneous understandings and pessimistic sentiments. During the Liu-Deng Army's internal line operations, they won ten battles in a row, achieving remarkable victories. In just 23 days, the Luoxi South Campaign annihilated nine and a half enemy brigades. However, once they entered the Dabie Mountains, they had only annihilated four brigades. Some people said that the victories after the counteroffensive were not as great as before. After the PLA entered the Dabie Mountains, the enemy concentrated 33 brigades to encircle them, making the environment extremely harsh. The troops suffered significant losses, and some people doubted whether the situation had worsened and whether the counteroffensive had failed. Later, to adapt to the changing situation, the main forces of the PLA withdrew from the Dabie Mountains and moved to Huabei. Some people thought this meant they could not hold out in the Dabie Mountains, that they had advanced a thousand miles but retreated five hundred. These erroneous understandings seriously affected the troops' morale. If this problem was not resolved, the Liu-Deng Army would not be able to complete the arduous task of fighting in the Dabie Mountains and achieving a strategic offensive as assigned by the Party Central Committee.

As the Political Commissar of the Liu-Deng Army, Deng Xiaoping was good at grasping the key issues and conducting targeted ideological and political work. He believed that the main reason for these erroneous ideas was the lack of a dialectical approach to viewing problems from a comprehensive perspective. He pointed out bluntly: "Some of our Communist Party members have too little Marxism-Leninism in their thinking. They see a small cloud over their heads and think the whole world is cloudy. They judge the success or failure of the revolution based on whether there is a cloud over their heads. In this way, when encountering difficulties, they will not see the light and victory, and they will inevitably become pessimistic and discouraged."

How should we view the situation after the counteroffensive? Deng Xiaoping believed that we should first view the problem from a comprehensive perspective. He used the method of accounting to explain. He said, "Whether the counteroffensive was a victory or a failure, 'as long as we carefully calculate, we will understand.' From the perspective of the number of enemies annihilated, although the Dabie Mountains did not annihilate many enemies after the counteroffensive, the national battlefield annihilated 1.12 million enemies in the year before the counteroffensive, and in the first nine months after the counteroffensive, this number was already reached. Adding the following months, it is certain to exceed this number, indicating greater achievements. From the perspective of the development of Central China, although the Dabie Mountains suffered some losses, with a 15% reduction in personnel, Jianghan increased by 100%, Tongbai increased by 50%, Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei increased by 100%, and Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu also developed. Therefore, from a comprehensive perspective, whether on the national battlefield or in Central China, the counteroffensive was a victory after all. Deng Xiaoping's method of accounting was both intuitive and clear, effectively illustrating the importance of viewing problems from a comprehensive perspective.

So, how should we view the relationship between local losses and overall victories? Deng Xiaoping believed that local interests should serve the overall interests, and temporarily sacrificing local interests is necessary to achieve overall victory. The PLA did suffer losses in the Dabie Mountains, but it was precisely because of the arduous struggle in the Dabie Mountains that the national battlefield achieved a victorious situation. He pointed out: "Now, Central China has attracted more than half of Chiang Kai-shek's southern forces, ensuring the victorious development of other regions. Although we have suffered the most in the national scope, paid the price, but exchanged strategic initiative, achieved overall victory." He also pointed out that war has always been a matter of one side bearing a heavier burden and the other side a lighter one. When we are the side bearing the heavier burden, we must not forget the whole, and the overall victory includes our share. These words eloquently explained the important role of the arduous struggle in the Dabie Mountains in achieving victory on the national battlefield, revealing the dialectical relationship between the whole and the parts.

Someone asked, the overall victory is certain, but the Dabie Mountains suffered losses and paid a price, how can we say it was a victory? Deng Xiaoping believed that this also needs to be viewed dialectically. Evaluating the victory in the Dabie Mountains should not be based solely on whether a price was paid and how many enemies were annihilated. The key is to see its significance and role. The Dabie Mountains have an important strategic position and are a contested area between the enemy and us. The PLA's advance into the Dabie Mountains attracted the enemy's heavy encirclement, and the price had to be paid. Chairman Mao had long anticipated this. He estimated three possible outcomes: one is paying the price and not being able to stand firm, retreating back; two is paying the price and not being able to stand firm, circling around; three is paying the price and standing firm. He said that as long as we stand firm, it is a victory. The Liu-Deng Army, through arduous struggle, completed this task, achieving the best outcome estimated by Chairman Mao, and the victory was well-deserved. At that time, Mao Zedong, in commenting on the national situation, praised Central China and Northeast China. The battles in Northeast China were good, annihilating many enemies, but Mao Zedong first mentioned Central China because Central China had the Dabie Mountains, a strategically important position, playing a crucial role in the overall victory.

In this speech, we see that Comrade Deng Xiaoping not only educated the entire army to strengthen the concept of the overall situation but also set an example by always prioritizing the overall situation.

Deng Xiaoping's experience of leading the troops to persist in the internal line struggle in the Dabie Mountains fully reflects this point.

To smash the enemy's heavy encirclement of the Dabie Mountains, two command posts were set up at that time, adopting the policy of internal line persistence, dividing forces outward, and coordinating internally and externally. Deng Xiaoping, the Political Commissar, and Deputy Commander Li Xiannian led the forward command post of the field army and part of the main forces to stay in the Dabie Mountains to persist in the internal line struggle; Commander Liu Bocheng led the rear command post of the field army and another part of the main forces to withdraw from the Dabie Mountains to Huabei, externally pinning down the enemy. From December 1947 to February 1948, over two months, Deng Xiaoping and others, along with the forward command post of the field army and about 500 people from the headquarters, under the pursuit and blockade of tens of thousands of enemy troops, with only one battalion of combat troops as cover, engaged in day-and-night skirmishes with the enemy in the deep mountains and forests of the Dabie Mountains. They also directed the various columns inside and outside the Dabie Mountains to fight tenaciously against the enemy. These two months were the most difficult period in the entire process of the Liu-Deng Army's advance into the Dabie Mountains and the greatest test since the PLA's counteroffensive.

However, even in such a perilous environment, Comrade Deng Xiaoping first thought of the overall situation. At that time, the Central Military Commission, to alleviate the severe situation in the Dabie Mountains, ordered Su Yu to quickly march south with four columns and merge with the Chen-She Army, advancing along the Pinghan Railway to Wuhan, to attract and divert some enemy forces out of the Dabie Mountains, reducing the pressure on the Dabie Mountains. After learning about this, Comrade Deng Xiaoping immediately expressed that the task of our army in the Dabie Mountains was to attract the enemy's heavy forces around us, so that brotherly forces could launch a counteroffensive and annihilate a large number of enemies. Therefore, no matter how much sacrifice and hardship we endure, we must hold out and cannot disperse the strength of the brotherly forces. He sent a telegram to the Central Military Commission, requesting that Chen-Su and Chen-She's support for the Dabie Mountains should not be rushed but should be based on long-term considerations. He said: "We bear a heavier burden in the Dabie Mountains. In the next three months, if Chen-Su and Chen-She can annihilate a large number of enemies, and Jianghan, Tongbai, and the Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei areas, as well as the areas north of the Huai River, can deeply penetrate, it will be extremely beneficial to the overall situation." He also suggested that the Central should leave the Yang-Su Column under their command in Huabei to participate in the Chen-Su Army's operations to annihilate a large number of enemies.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping and Comrade Li Xiannian's spirit of shouldering heavy responsibilities and daring to struggle even in extremely difficult situations left a deep impression on many old comrades. The original commander of the 3rd Column, Chen Xilian, recalled: "During the march north of Xingfu City, I went to the forward command post of the field army and saw Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping and Deputy Commander Li Xiannian. As soon as we met, Li jokingly said: Comrade Xilian, can you carry it? Political Commissar Deng then said: We should carry more and bear more. We should not be afraid of getting burned when we remove the pot from the fire. To divert the enemy to reinforce the crucial areas, this is a strategic action related to the overall situation. We should bear more enemies, be willing to endure hardship for a period, and pin down dozens of enemy brigades around us, so that the brotherly forces in Shandong and Shaanbei can free their hands and annihilate a large number of enemies. Now, the Chen-Su and Chen-She armies, to cooperate with us in smashing the enemy's encirclement, have begun to attack the enemy along the Pinghan and Longhai Railways. I am prepared to tell them to make long-term plans. We bear a heavier burden in the Dabie Mountains, and they can annihilate enemies at will, which is beneficial to the overall situation."

What moving words! What precious spirit! This is precisely the spirit of the Liu-Deng Army. After the Luoxi South Campaign, Liu-Deng, to relieve the danger in Shaanbei and Shandong, despite the enormous difficulties of continuous battles, lack of rest, shortage of ammunition, and severe enemy situation, decided to advance to the Dabie Mountains ahead of schedule, "to meet the needs of the overall situation." During the most difficult times of the Huaihai Campaign, Deng Xiaoping once firmly stated: As long as the main forces of the southern enemy are annihilated, even if the New Fourth Army is wiped out, the other major armies can still achieve national victory, and this price is worth it. It was with this spirit that the Liu-Deng Army won the praise of "Liu-Deng fighting hard" and "Liu-Deng's style is high" in the entire army. Comrade Chen Yi once said: It was precisely because Liu-Deng pinned down the enemy in the Dabie Mountains that various places could smoothly transition to the offensive and won many victories. If we were to give credit, each place could only get half, and the other half should be given to the fighters who persisted in the struggle in the Dabie Mountains.

(3)

The reason why the Liu-Deng Army could persist in the struggle in the Dabie Mountains and achieve victory in such a harsh environment, in addition to having the concept of the overall situation, was also because they had the fearless revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win. In the speech, Deng Xiaoping emphasized this revolutionary spirit.

What does it mean to dare to struggle and dare to win? Deng Xiaoping believed that this means having the spirit of self-sacrifice and fearlessness in the face of hardship at the critical moment of revolutionary success or failure. He pointed out that revolution is not a comfortable thing. "The closer to victory, the more arduous the struggle. Everyone hopes for a quick revolutionary victory, but when asked if you dare to win, the problem arises. Not everyone who hopes for victory dares to win. To win, you have to endure hardship." Here, Deng Xiaoping criticized the two main erroneous tendencies in the army at that time. One was that the northern troops were afraid of the hardships in the south and afraid to cross the Yangtze River; the other was the "fear of America" syndrome.

The Liu-Deng Army's advance into the Dabie Mountains, under the heavy encirclement of the enemy, deep into the enemy's territory without friendly support or rear supply, was extremely arduous. Not to mention the hardships of marching and fighting, just the northern troops far from home, coming to the south, from the plains to the mountains, the geographical environment and living habits were not adapted, and this alone was enough hardship.

How should we view this hardship? Deng Xiaoping believed that to revolutionize, to win, we must endure hardship. At the critical moment of the revolutionary war, for those who forget their heavy responsibilities and only fear hardship and seek life, "it is best to give them a slap on the head and criticize them." He solemnly pointed out that daring to cross the Yangtze River or not, fearing hardship or not, is a matter of principle, a matter of whether the revolution is resolute or not. He said, daring to win means daring to cross the Yangtze River. "The enemy still controls tens of millions of people's areas. Only by crossing the Yangtze River and attacking the enemy's heart, can we achieve national victory." Deng Xiaoping also pointed out that different standpoints and starting points lead to different views on problems. He said to those who feared hardship and spread pessimistic sentiments, you say the Dabie Mountains are not good, but I say the Dabie Mountains are very good. The terrain is good, the people are good, there is no shortage of food, it is a very good strategic forward base, and an important jumping-off point for crossing the Yangtze River. He said, the hardship in the Dabie Mountains is certain, but we must see that hardship can bring back many sweet things. Embracing the big picture, daring to struggle and dare to win, will not be intimidated by the harsh environment and will face difficulties with an optimistic attitude.

Another erroneous tendency that Deng Xiaoping criticized was the "fear of America" syndrome. The "fear of America" syndrome was serious in the early stages of the liberation war. After a year of great victories in the self-defense war, the number of people with this tendency had greatly decreased. However, after the Liu-Deng Army arrived in the Dabie Mountains, the environment became harsh, and the "fear of America" syndrome resurfaced. Some people said, giving Chiang Kai-shek tens of millions of dollars and guns, we already know it is of little use, but now we are afraid of American intervention, afraid of American atomic bombs. Deng Xiaoping criticized this seriously.

He said: "Many comrades do not believe Chairman Mao's judgment that American imperialism is a paper tiger, thinking that American intervention is very fierce, and we are bound to fail. This is unacceptable for a revolutionary." To inspire the army's fighting spirit and courage, he once told a story about Chairman Mao's struggle with Packard. In Yan'an, once the head of the American observation group, Colonel Packard, arrogantly told Chairman Mao: I will send 7,000 people to parachute into your various liberated areas. Chairman Mao said: No, I am not responsible for any problems! Packard threatened: If not, I will only help Chiang Kai-shek! Chairman Mao solemnly replied: You eat your bread and butter! You have big guns, and I have my rice and rifles. I will not drive you away in a hundred years, but I will drive you away in a hundred and one years! The next day, Packard went to Chairman Mao to apologize, saying he had said the wrong words because he was drunk the day before. Deng Xiaoping said, people from colonies, the longer they are under colonial rule, the softer their bones become. But we are Communist Party members, the vanguard of the proletariat. The servile appearance that Lu Xun often criticized, Communist Party members should not have. We should dare to despise American imperialism and look down on those who fear foreigners. He sharply pointed out that the fundamental issue is that "as Communist Party members, anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism are our revolutionary program and revolutionary tasks. Why should we fear imperialism? Not to mention that American intervention is not that easy, even if they intervene, I ask: Do you still want to revolutionize? Do you still want the anti-imperialist program? Do you still qualify as the vanguard of the proletariat? A Communist Party member with good qualities should answer: Fight him, fight to the end! We must have this courage." Deng Xiaoping's words shocked the army, and those with the "fear of America" syndrome and cowardice felt ashamed, gained courage, and established the belief that they could definitely defeat the seemingly powerful American imperialism throughout the army.

What is the significance of learning from Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech for our current work?

First, it is very important to view the situation from a comprehensive and dialectical perspective today. Ten years of reform and opening up have had twists and turns and mistakes. However, these cannot cover up the great achievements we have made in various aspects. In the past ten years, China's economic landscape has undergone tremendous changes, and people's lives have significantly improved. In industry, agriculture, commerce, foreign trade, and education and science, there have been great developments. Especially as the Thirteenth National Congress pointed out, the significance of reform for China lies not only in what it has brought us but more importantly in that it has ended the closed and stagnant situation, opening up a new historical development period. And all this, compared to the mistakes, is precisely our most important aspect. Recently, the central leadership has required us to proudly publicize the great achievements of the 40th anniversary, especially the tremendous achievements of reform and opening up in the past ten years. Only in this way can we inspire the people, boost morale, and make the people see the bright future of socialist reform. At the same time, we must also see that reform is a matter that previous generations have not experienced, and some twists and turns, paying a certain price, are inevitable. We must have a sufficient understanding of the arduousness and complexity of reform, and on the premise of fully affirming the achievements, deeply reflect on the problems in various aspects of the work. Currently, it is especially important to carry out the work of rectification and adjustment under the principles of adhering to the four cardinal principles and adhering to reform and opening up, maintaining a stable and united political situation.

Second, the current rectification and adjustment and the deepening of reform particularly require a sense of the overall situation. In recent years, under the guidance of the policies of reform, opening up, and vitalizing the economy, simplifying administration and expanding enterprise autonomy have mobilized the enthusiasm of various regions, departments, and enterprises, achieving remarkable results. However, while micro-level vitalization is being carried out, macro-control has not kept up in a timely manner, leading to some problems. Currently, we must resolutely reduce the scale of fixed asset investments, control the growth of consumption funds, rectify and adjust various companies in the circulation sector, and appropriately concentrate funds, cancel certain tax preferences, and reduce special allocations, etc. These all involve the existing distribution of interests, requiring certain local interests to make necessary concessions. This requires all regions, systems, and departments across the country to start from the overall situation, with local interests serving the overall interests and local areas serving the central government, firmly implementing the central government's policies of rectifying the economic environment, adjusting the economic order, and deepening reform. It is necessary to emphasize that our reform is a self-improvement and self-development of the socialist system under the unified leadership of the Party, a comprehensive and orderly social transformation process. We do not allow the use of reform to engage in anarchism, only caring about the interests of one's own region, department, and unit, denying the centralized and unified leadership of the central government. Any behavior that disregards the overall situation, acts independently, does as one pleases, and has policies but no implementation, only creates obstacles for reform.

    胸怀全局  敢于胜利
    ——学习邓小平《跃进中原的胜利形势与今后的政策策略》一文
    冷溶
    1948年2月，中共中央中原局第一书记、中原野战军政治委员邓小平，率领刘邓大军部分主力，在胜利粉碎了敌人对大别山重兵围剿后，从大别山内转出，在淮北与刘伯承司令员会合，以后又一起来到中原局所属的陈谢大军所在地豫陕鄂解放区。4月25日，邓小平召集豫陕鄂前委和后委的负责同志，在河南省鲁山县召开了豫陕鄂前后委联席会议。参加会议的有陈赓、谢富治、秦基伟、黄镇、孔从周、张玺等。邓小平在这次会议上做了一个十分重要的讲话，这就是收入到《邓小平文选》中的《跃进中原的胜利形势与今后的政策策略》一文。
    1948年的春天，正是我人民解放军战略反攻取得了决定性的胜利，平津、辽沈、淮海三大战役将要拉开战幕之际。在这历史的关键时刻，肩负南线战场指挥重任的邓小平，以战略家的胸怀和眼光，站在全局的高度，总结和分析了战略反攻以来全国和中原的胜利形势，明确提出了今后的任务。这篇讲话有着丰富而深刻的思想内容。特别是关于从全局出发，勇挑重担，敢于斗争、敢于胜利的观点，对于我们今天正在进行的社会主义现代化建设，有着十分重要的意义。
    （一）
    胸怀战略全局，全面地辩证地看待反攻后的胜利形势，是这篇讲话的一个重要内容。
    刘邓大军挺进大别山，跃进了一千里，实现了我军的战略进攻，改变了全国战局，成就巨大，意义深远，毛泽东曾给予极高评价。然而，如果仅从大别山的一个局部看，当时的形势却异常严重。许多同志由此产生了一些错误的认识和悲观情绪。刘邓大军在内线作战时，十战十捷，战功卓著，仅鲁西南战役，23天歼敌九个半旅。可是一到大别山，前后才歼敌四个旅。于是有人说，反攻以后胜利不如原来大了。我军到大别山后，敌人集中33个旅的优势兵力进行围剿，环境变得异常艰苦，部队减员较多，又有人怀疑局面是否变坏了，反攻失败了。后来，为适应形势发展的需要，我军主力转出大别山，来到淮北，有人又认为这是在大别山站不住了，是前进了一千里，后退五百里。这些错误认识严重影响着部队的斗志，不解决这个问题，刘邓大军就不能完成党中央交给的坚持大别山斗争，实现战略进攻的艰巨任务。
    身为刘邓大军政治委员的邓小平，善于抓住问题的关键，有针对性地进行思想政治工作。他认为，有这些错误想法的同志，在认识上的主要原因，是缺少一种从全局出发辩证地看问题的思想方法。他一针见血地指出：“我们有些共产党员，马列主义的思想方法太少，看见自己头上有一小块云，就认为天下都是云，凭直觉来看问题，凭自己脑袋上面有没有乌云来判断革命胜利或失败，这样，遇到困难就不会看到光明和胜利，就没有不悲观失望的。”
    怎样看待反攻后的形势呢？邓小平认为首先要从全局出发看问题。他用算账的方法来说明。他说，反攻是胜利了还是失败了，“只要好好地算算账，就会懂得的。”从消灭敌人的数字看，反攻后大别山虽然没有消灭多少敌人，但全国战场，反攻前一年歼敌一百一十二万，而反攻后头九个月就已经达到了这个数字，加上后几个月，肯定会超过这个数字，可见成绩更大了。再从中原的发展看，大别山虽有一定损失，减员百分之十五，但江汉发展了百分之百，桐柏发展了百分之五十，豫陕鄂发展了百分之百，豫皖苏也是发展的。所以，从全局看，无论是全国战场还是中原，反攻以后都胜利了。邓小平的这种算账方法，既直观又明确，有力地说明了从全局看问题的重要性。
    那么如何看待局部损失和全局胜利的关系呢？邓小平认为，局部要服从全局，为实现全局的胜利，暂时牺牲局部是必要的。我军在大别山确有损失，但正是有了大别山的艰苦奋斗，才有了全国战场的胜利局面。他指出：“现在，中原吸引了蒋介石南线的一半以上的兵力，保证了其他地区的胜利展开。虽在全国范围吃苦头最多，付出了代价，但换取了战略上的主动，取得了全局的胜利。”他还指出，打仗从来就是一头担轻一头担重，当我们担重的一头时，千万别忘了整体，整个胜利是有我们一份的。这些话精辟地说明了大别山艰苦斗争对全国战场胜利所起到的重要作用，揭示了全局与局部的辩证关系。
    有人问，全局胜利是肯定的了，但大别山受了损失，付了代价，怎么能说胜利了呢？邓小平认为这同样需要全面地辩证地看。衡量大别山的胜利，不能仅看是否付了代价，消灭了多少敌人，关键看它的意义和作用。大别山战略地位重要，是敌我必争之地。我军挺进大别山，吸引了敌人重兵围剿，代价肯定要付的。对此，毛主席早有预料，他估计了三个前途。一是付了代价，站不住脚，退回来；二是付了代价，站不稳，在周围打转转；三是付了代价，站住脚。他说只要站住脚，就是胜利。刘邓大军经过艰苦奋斗，完成了这一任务，争取到了毛主席估计的最好前途，胜利是当之无愧的。当时毛泽东在评论全国战局时，表扬了中原和东北，东北仗打得好，消灭敌人多，但毛泽东首先讲的是中原，因为中原有大别山，战略地位重要，对全局胜利起了关键作用。
    （二）
    在这篇讲话中我们看到，邓小平同志不但教育全军要加强全局观念，而且他自己就是处处以全局为重的榜样。邓小平率部坚持大别山内线斗争的经历，充分反映了这一点。
    为了粉碎敌人对大别山的重兵围剿，当时分成两个指挥所，采取内线坚持，分兵向外，内外配合的方针。由邓小平政委、李先念副司令员率领野战军前方指挥所和一部分主力留在大别山坚持内线斗争；刘伯承司令员率领野战军后方指挥所和另一部分主力，转出大别山到淮北，在外线箝制敌人。从1947年12月到1948年2月的两个多月的时间中，邓小平等人与野战军前方指挥所机关五百多人，在敌人数十万重兵围追堵截中，仅以一个营的战斗部队为掩护，与敌人日夜周旋于大别山的深山野岭之间，并指挥大别山内外各纵队与敌人进行顽强的斗争。这两个月是刘邓大军挺进大别山全过程中最困难的时期，是我军反攻以来面临的最大考验。
    然而，就是在这种险恶的环境中，邓小平同志首先想到的还是全局。当时，中央军委为了缓解大别山的严重局面，命令粟裕以4个纵队迅速南下，与陈谢大军会合，沿平汉路直迫武汉，以吸引调动一部分敌人出大别山，减轻大别山的压力。邓小平同志知道后，立即表示，我军在大别山的任务，就是为了吸引敌人重兵于自己周围，使兄弟部队能够展开反攻，大量歼敌。因此，自己再牺牲再艰苦也要坚持住，不能分散兄弟部队的力量。他打电报给中央军委，要求陈粟、陈谢对大别山的支援不宜急躁，而要立足于长远考虑。他说：“我们在大别山背重些，在三个月内，陈粟、陈谢能大量歼敌，江汉桐柏及豫陕鄂区、淮河以北地区能深入工作，对全局则极有利。”他还建议中央将他们所属的杨苏纵队留在淮北，参加陈粟军作战，以便大量歼敌。
    邓小平、李先念等同志这种在自己极其困难的情况下，还能从全局出发，勇挑重担的精神，给许多老同志留下了深刻印象。原3纵司令员陈锡联回忆道：“在经扶城北的行进途中，我到野战军前方指挥所，见到了邓小平政委和李先念副司令员，一见面李开玩笑地讲：锡联同志，背得动吗？邓政委接着说：就是要多背一些，背重一些，釜底抽薪就不要怕烫手。调动敌人回援根本重地，这是个关系全局的战略行动。我们多背一些敌人，宁愿本身多忍受一个时期的艰苦，也要拖住敌人几十个旅于自己周围，使山东、陕北的兄弟部队能腾出手来，大量消灭敌人。现在陈粟、陈谢的部队为配合我们粉碎敌人的围攻，已开始向平汉、陇海路的敌人出击。我准备告诉他们，要作长期打算，我们在大别山背重一些，他们可以放手歼敌，对全局有利。”
    这是多么感人的话语，这是多么可贵的精神！而这正是刘邓大军一贯的精神。在鲁西南战役结束后，刘邓为解陕北、山东之危，不顾自己连续作战，未及休整、弹药匮乏、敌情严重等巨大困难，毅然决定提前向大别山出动，“以应全局之需”。在淮海战役打到最艰苦的时候，邓小平曾坚决地表示：只要歼灭南线敌人主力，中野（即刘邓大军）就是打光了，其他各路大军还可以取得全国胜利，这个代价是值得的。刘邓大军正是以这种精神，在全军中赢得“刘邓打得艰苦”、“刘邓风格高”的赞誉。陈毅同志曾经说过这样一段话：正是因为刘邓在大别山拖住了敌人，各地才能顺利转入进攻，打了不少胜仗。要记功的话，各地只能记一半，另一半要记在坚持大别山斗争的指战员身上。
    （三）
    刘邓大军所以能够在艰苦的环境中，坚持大别山斗争，并取得了胜利，除了具有全局观念外，还具有敢于斗争、敢于胜利的大无畏的革命精神。在讲话中，邓小平着重论述了这种革命精神。
    什么叫敢于斗争、敢于胜利？邓小平认为，这就是在革命成败的关键时刻，要有不畏艰苦、勇于牺牲的献身精神。他指出，革命不是什么舒服的事情，“越接近胜利斗争越艰苦。谁都希望革命快些胜利，可是，问你敢不敢胜利，问题就来了。不一定希望胜利的人就敢于胜利。要胜利就要吃苦。”在这里，邓小平批评了当时部队存在的两种主要的错误倾向，一个是北方部队怕到南方吃苦头，怕过长江；另一个是“恐美病”。
    刘邓大军挺进大别山，在敌人重兵围剿下，孤军深入敌人腹地，无友邻配合，无后方物资接济，其艰苦程度可想而知。且不说行军打仗流血牺牲，就说北方的部队远离家乡，来到南方，从平原到山区，地理环境和生活习惯都不适应，仅此一点，也是够艰苦了。
    怎样看待这种吃苦呢？邓小平认为，要革命、要胜利、就要吃苦。在革命战争处于关键时刻，对那些忘记自己肩负的重任，一味害怕艰苦、贪生怕死的人，“最好给他当头一棒，批评他一通”。他严肃地指出，敢不敢过长江，怕不怕吃苦，这是一个路线问题，是革命坚决不坚决的问题。他说，敢于胜利，就要敢于过长江。“敌人还统治着几万万人口的地区，只有打过长江去，打到敌人的心脏，才能取得全国的胜利。”邓小平还指出，立场不同，出发点不同，对问题的看法就不同。他针对那些怕艰苦，散布悲观情绪的人说，你们说大别山不好，我说大别山好得很。地形好，群众好，不缺粮食，是战略上很好的前进基地，是打过长江的重要跳板。他说，大别山艰苦是肯定的，但要看到苦能换回许多甜的东西。胸怀全局，敢于斗争、敢于胜利，就不会被艰苦的环境所吓倒，就会以乐观的态度对待困难。
    邓小平批评的另一个错误倾向是“恐美病”。“恐美病”在解放战争初期曾严重存在，经过一年自卫战争的伟大胜利，有这种思想倾向的人已大大减少。但是刘邓大军来到大别山，环境变得艰苦起来以后，“恐美病”又有所发展。有人说，给蒋介石几万万美金和枪炮，我们已经知道没有多大用处了，现在就是怕美国出兵，怕美国的原子弹。对此，邓小平进行了严肃的批评。
    他说：“很多同志不相信毛主席讲的美帝国主义是纸老虎的论断，以为美国出兵凶得很，我们非失败不可。这对一个革命者来说是要不得的。”为了激发部队的斗争信心和勇气，他曾讲过一个毛主席与包瑞德斗争的故事。在延安，有一次美国观察组组长包瑞德上校狂妄地对毛主席说：我要派七千人降落到你们各个解放区来。毛主席说：不行，出了问题我不负责任！包威胁说：不行我就只有帮助蒋介石了！毛主席严正地回答：你吃你的面包牛油去吧！你有大炮，我有我的小米加步枪，一百年赶你不走，我一百零一年也要赶你滚蛋！第二天，包瑞德非常没趣地去向毛主席道歉。说他昨天因为喝醉了酒，说错了话。邓小平说，殖民地的人，当久了，骨头就软了。但我们是共产党员，是无产阶级先锋队，鲁迅先生常常骂的奴才相，共产党员是不能有的。我们要敢于藐视美帝国主义，鄙视那些怕外国人的奴才相。他尖锐地指出，根本问题在于“作为共产党员，反帝反封建是我们的革命纲领、革命任务，我们为什么要怕帝国主义？不要说美国出兵不是那样容易，就是出兵，我要反问：你还革命不革命？还要不要反帝这个纲领？还够不够得上是无产阶级的先锋队？具有优良品质的共产党员，应该回答：和他干，干到底！就要有这个气魄。”邓小平的这些话，震动了部队，那些有“恐美病”倾向的人、怯弱的人感到了羞愧，增添了勇气，全军上下建立起了一定能打败貌似强大的美帝国主义的必胜信念。
    （四）
    学习邓小平同志的这篇讲话，对于我们当前的工作有什么意义呢？
    第一，从全局出发，全面地辩证地看待形势，在今天十分重要。十年改革开放，有曲折、有失误。但是这些丝毫也不能掩盖我们在各方面取得的伟大成就。十年来，我国的经济面貌已发生了巨大变化，人民生活显著改善。在工业、农业、商业、对外贸易和科教事业方面都有很大发展。特别是如十三届三中全会所指出的，改革对于中国的意义，不仅在于它已经给我们带来了什么，更重要的在于它结束了封闭和停滞的局面，开辟了新的历史发展时期。而这一切对于失误来说，恰恰是我们最主要的一面。最近，中央领导同志要求我们，要理直气壮地宣传40周年的伟大成就，特别是近十年来改革、开放所取得的巨大成果。这样才能鼓舞人民，振奋士气，使人民看到社会主义改革的光明前途。同时，我们也要看到，改革是一项前人没有经历过的事业，有一些曲折，付一定的代价是难免的。我们要对改革的艰巨性和复杂性有足够的认识，要在充分肯定成绩的前提下，深刻反思各方面工作上的问题。当前，特别要在坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放的原则下，搞好治理整顿工作，维护安定团结的政治局面。
    第二，当前的治理、整顿与深化改革，特别需要有全局观念。这些年来，在改革、开放、搞活的方针指导下，简政放权、扩大企业自主权，调动了各地区、各部门和企业的积极性，成绩显著。但是，在微观搞活的同时，宏观调控没有及时跟上，出现了一些问题。当前，我们要下决心压缩固定资产投资规模，控制消费基金增长，清理整顿流通领域的各种公司以及适当集中资金，取消某些税收优惠，压缩专项拨款等等，这些都要涉及现有利益的分配格局，要求某些局部利益做一些必要的让步，这就要求全国各地、各系统和各部门都要从全局出发，局部服从全局、地方服从中央，坚决贯彻执行中央治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序和深化改革的方针。需要强调指出，我们的改革是在党的统一领导下的社会主义制度的自我完善和自我发展，是一个整体的、有序的社会变革过程。我们决不允许借口改革搞无政府主义，只顾本地区、本部门和本单位的利益，否定中央集中统一领导的行为。任何不顾大局，各自为政，自行其是，搞“上有政策，下有对策”，有令不行，有禁不止的行为，只会给改革设置障碍。
    第三，进行社会主义现代化建设，搞改革开放，是一项艰苦的事业。我们在前进道路上会有很多困难，有时还要付出血的代价。我们要发扬邓小平等老一辈无产阶级革命家在战争年代所表现出来的那种敢于斗争、敢于胜利，不畏艰苦、勇于献身的革命精神，把他们开创的社会主义改革事业继续进行下去。当年，邓小平同志在挺进大别山的过程中向全军提出“全心全意、义无反顾”的口号，表现了破釜沉舟的胜利决心。今天，我们阅读着这些生动感人的文字，为那种胸怀全局的气魄和敢于胜利的精神所鼓舞，更应该以全部身心投入到社会主义现代化建设和改革开放的事业中去。不管前面还会遇到怎样的困难，我们将永远向前。
