The Five Pagoda Temple is a famous monastery in the frontier region. It is renowned alongside the Potala Palace in Tibet and the Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai as one of China's three great Tibetan Buddhist temples.

The Five Pagoda Temple is located 70 kilometers northeast of Baotou, in the Five Pagoda Valley. It was initially built during the reign of Kangxi in the Qing Dynasty and underwent extensive renovations in the 14th year of the Qianlong reign (1749). The temple is built against the mountain, grand in scale, and opulent in decoration. Its design mimics the Tashilhunpo Monastery in Tibet, making it the only purely Tibetan-style temple in the Inner Mongolia region. The Five Pagoda Temple covers an area of over 300 mu, with 2,500 rooms. The murals and statues within the halls are each unique in style.

The Five Pagoda Temple, named as a temple, is actually an institution for training high-level Tibetan Buddhist monks in scripture, discipline, and doctrine. The four main halls within the temple serve as the four major colleges (Langsang), each offering a different specialization. At its peak, the temple attracted over 1,200 students from far and wide, including many living Buddhas and monks.

One of the four halls, the Cheyi Lin Duogong, is the philosophy college. It specializes in teaching Buddhist philosophy and doctrine, with a course duration of 21 years. Graduates with outstanding performance can obtain the highest academic degree and qualify to serve as the head of a major temple.

The Dongkuo'er Duogong is the college for astronomy and geography, focusing on mathematics. The A Hui Duogong is the college for esoteric Buddhism and scriptures. The Rimo Lun Duogong is the college for the path to enlightenment, primarily studying the history, doctrine, and regulations of Tibetan Buddhism.

In its heyday, this ancient temple in the deep mountains produced a large number of highly educated Tibetan Buddhist monks. The numerous scriptures and other works they authored are famous in both Inner Mongolia and Tibet.

Today, the Five Pagoda Temple has become a popular tourist destination in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Although the scene of monks gathering and chanting scriptures is no longer present, the temple's architecture remains intact, and the murals and statues retain high artistic value.

    五当召
    赵敏毅
    五当召是塞外名寺，它与西藏的布达拉宫、青海的塔尔寺并驾齐名为我国三大喇嘛教名寺。
    五当召位于包头东北70公里处的五当沟内。它初建于清康熙年间，于乾隆十四年（1749年）进行大规模重修。庙宇依山建造，气势宏伟，富丽堂皇，其造型仿制西藏的扎什伦布寺，是内蒙古地区唯一的纯藏式庙宇。五当召占地300多亩，共有房舍2500间，殿内壁画、塑像各具特色。
    五当召名为召庙，实为一座培养造就喇嘛教的高级经、律、论僧人的学府。庙内的四大殿堂分别成为喇嘛们学习的四大拉桑（学院），开设着四个专业。当时，许多活佛、僧人千里迢迢来此学习，最多时，就学人员达1200余人。
    四大殿之一的却伊林独宫，是哲学学院。这里专门讲授佛教的哲理和教义，学期21年。学成的优秀者可获最高学位，具有担任中山寺院“堪布”（主持）的资格。
    洞阔尔独宫，是讲授和研究天文地理的数学院。阿会独宫，是学习密宗、咒经的学府。日木伦独宫，是成佛之道学院，主要研究藏传佛教的历史、教义和教规。
    当年，这座深山古刹培养出了大量佛教高级知识渊博的喇嘛人才，他们撰写的大量经书和其他著作，在内蒙古和西藏均负盛名。
    现在，五当召已成为内蒙古自治区的旅游胜地。僧众云集，经声琅琅的情景虽已不复存在，但召内的建筑依旧，壁画、塑像均有很高的艺术价值。
