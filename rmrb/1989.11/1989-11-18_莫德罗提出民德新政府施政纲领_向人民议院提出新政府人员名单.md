People's Daily, Berlin, November 17th. Correspondent Xu Hongzhi reports: The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, Hans Modrow, read a government statement at the 12th session of the People's Chamber today, outlining the new government's domestic and foreign policy stances and proposing reforms in various political and economic areas.

He said that the people of the GDR hope to renew the socialist society and state, and hope for a better socialism. A better socialism must provide opportunities for all people to create a rich and colorful life, to fully develop their personalities, and to build comradely relationships within the collective. Such a socialism, through the labor of all citizens, will become an efficient society and will be able to provide welfare guarantees for all citizens based on its economic achievements. When discussing the principles of reform in the GDR, Modrow said that reforms must be carried out gradually with the consensus of all political forces, and must be both bold and not too hasty.

When discussing political reforms, he said that political reforms are linked to legislative steps, with the aim of strengthening the rule of law and legal guarantees in the state. In particular, the drafting of election laws, the law on the Council of Ministers, and the press law.

The goal of economic reform is to enhance the self-responsibility of various economic units to improve efficiency; central planning should be reduced to the necessary extent, and the principle of "more work, more pay" should be gradually implemented.

When discussing the foreign policy of the GDR, he said that external peace conditions are conducive to the GDR's reforms. He said that the GDR's coalition government will strive to make the GDR a factor of security and stability in Europe. The GDR will further develop relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, continue to fulfill its obligations in the Warsaw Pact, and cooperate with capitalist countries, including West Germany.

At today's meeting, on the proposal of the parliamentary group of the Socialist Unity Party, it was decided to revoke the membership of 27 people, including Honecker, Stoph, Sindemann, Mittag, and Hermann, in the People's Chamber.

People's Daily, Berlin, November 17th. Correspondent Xu Hongzhi reports: The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, Hans Modrow, presented a new government list to the People's Chamber today.

This list was proposed after extensive consultations, with the number of government members reduced from 44 to 28. The Council of Ministers has three deputy chairmen, held by Krista Luft (female) of the Socialist Unity Party, Peter Moreth of the Liberal Democratic Party, and Lothar de Maizière of the Christian Democratic Union. Among the heads of various ministries, the Socialist Unity Party holds 15 positions, the Liberal Democratic Party holds 3 positions, and the Christian Democratic Union, National Democratic Party, and Democratic Farmers' Party each hold 2 positions. Modrow emphasized that this is a coalition government.

    莫德罗提出民德新政府施政纲领
    向人民议院提出新政府人员名单
    本报柏林11月17日电　记者许宏治报道：民主德国部长会议主席莫德罗今天上午在人民议院第12次会议上宣读政府声明，阐述了新政府内外政策的主张，提出了政治、经济各方面改革设想。
    他说，民德人民希望对社会主义社会和国家进行革新，希望有一个好的社会主义。一个更好的社会主义必须给所有的人提供创造丰富多彩的生活、个性充分发挥和在集体中建立同志情谊的机会。这样的社会主义，通过全体公民的劳动就会变成一个有效率的社会，才能按照其经济成就给全体公民提供福利保障。莫德罗在谈到民主德国实行改革的原则时说，改革必须在各派政治力量一致赞同的情况下逐步实行，既要大胆，又不能过急。
    在谈到政治改革时，他说，政治改革与立法步骤相联系，目的是加强国家的法制性和法律保障。特别是制定选举法、部长会议法和新闻法。
    经济改革的目标是增强各经济单位的自我责任，以提高效率；中央级计划要缩减到必需的程度，要逐步贯彻多劳多得的原则。
    在谈到民主德国的对外政策时，他说，外部的和平条件有助于民德的革新。他说，民德联合政府将致力于使民德成为欧洲安全和稳定的因素。民德要进一步发展同苏联和其他社会主义国家的关系，继续承担在华约的义务，并同资本主义国家、包括西德进行合作。
    在今天的会议上通过统一社会党议会党团的建议，决定取消昂纳克、斯多夫、辛德曼、米塔格、赫尔曼等27人的人民议院议员资格。
    本报柏林11月17日电　记者许宏治报道：民主德国部长会议主席汉斯·莫德罗今天向人民议院提出了新政府名单。
