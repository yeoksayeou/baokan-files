In the Western world, the Nobel Prize, as the pinnacle of academic achievement and a symbol of the highest honor, has always been a goal that scholars strive for. However, since its establishment 88 years ago, the Nobel Prize has also been a source of continuous controversy. This year, in addition to the Nobel Peace Prize causing dissent, the other two Nobel Prizes have also sparked considerable thought.

In 1989, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to two American scientists, J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus. French scientist Dominique Stehelin immediately raised objections, arguing that he had collaborated with the two winners and directly participated in the research and discovery of the awarded findings. He believed it was unfair to exclude him from the list of awardees. In contrast, 77-year-old Norwegian scholar Trygve Haavelmo, upon learning that he had won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for a theoretical study he conducted over 40 years ago, remained indifferent.

The Nobel Committee, the organization responsible for selecting Nobel Prize winners, has indeed made some questionable and even erroneous choices. In 1912, a simple device for controlling the gas flow in lighthouses won the Nobel Prize in Physics, while Einstein's theory of relativity, at that time and even later, never received the Nobel Prize. In 1926, a "discovery" related to cancer research that won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is now proven to be groundless. In recent years, the Nobel Peace Prize has become increasingly politicized, to the extent that it is used as a means to achieve certain political goals.

If it is inevitable that the Nobel Committee overlooks some great scientists and scientific achievements, then its erroneous choices are truly regrettable. Furthermore, some undesirable phenomena induced by the Nobel Prize in the academic community have caused concern among many scientists.

Professor Minxin Pei of Cornell University believes that the competitive tendency driven by the pursuit of the Nobel Prize has destroyed the atmosphere that scientific research should have. He thinks the Nobel Prize should inspire people's spirit of scientific exploration, but the current research structure is increasingly focused on winning the Nobel Prize, deviating from the purpose of seeking scientific discoveries.

In his book "The Scientific Elite," Dr. Jonathan R. Cole of Columbia University also discusses some problems caused by the Nobel Prize. The Nobel Prize uses a nomination and selection method. Each previous winner has the right to nominate candidates to the Nobel Committee. The Committee then selects the winner from the nominees. Some research institutes or universities have multiple Nobel laureates. They can effectively recommend candidates for their departments or friends and colleagues. Some departments or individuals go to great lengths to gain nominations, wasting valuable time on lobbying efforts unrelated to science. Cole also points out that many scientists' research output decreases significantly after winning the prize.

The essence of science lies in serving humanity. However, many scientists and research institutions block information from each other. Some people, in order to win the prize, rush to publish unfinished research. Some even openly plagiarize and deceive.

Of course, it is unfair to blame all the negative phenomena in academia on the Nobel Prize. The Nobel Prize has a positive impact on the development of science and technology and the progress of human civilization, which should not be denied. However, people also have reason to question the flaws in the Nobel Prize.

    诺贝尔奖引起的异议
    姚海泉
    在西方世界，作为学术成就的巅峰和崇高荣誉的桂冠，诺贝尔奖一直是芸芸学者孜孜以求的目标。然而，自设立至今88年来，诺贝尔奖引起的争议也从未间断。今年，除诺贝尔和平奖引起异议外，另外两项诺贝尔奖所引起的反响也颇引人思考。
    1989年诺贝尔医学奖授予两位美国科学家彼少普和瓦莫斯。法国科学家斯蒂林闻此后立即提出异议。因为他曾与两位获奖者合作，并直接参与获奖成果的研究和发现。他认为把他排除在获奖人之外是不公平的。与此形成对照，77岁的挪威学者哈维尔摩当得知他因其40多年前的一项理论研究而荣获今年诺贝尔经济学奖时，却不以为然。
    诺贝尔奖评选机构诺贝尔委员会确曾做出过一些蹩脚，甚至错误的选择。1912年，一个控制灯塔燃气流量的简单装置曾获诺贝尔物理奖，而爱因斯坦的相对论在当时，以至后来从未获得诺贝尔奖。1926年获得诺贝尔医学奖的关于癌症研究的一项“成果”现在被证明是毫无根据的。近年来，诺贝尔和平奖的意识形态色彩日益浓重，以致被用来作为达到某种政治目的的手段。
    如果说诺贝尔委员会遗漏一些伟大的科学家和科学成果是在所难免的话，那么它所做出的错误选择则实在令人遗憾。另外，诺贝尔奖在学术界诱发的一些不良现象已引起许多科学家的忧虑。
    美国康奈尔大学莫敏教授认为，为了获奖而导致的竞争倾向破坏了科学研究应有的气氛。他认为诺贝尔奖应该激发人们的科学探索精神，而目前的科研结构却越来越以获得诺贝尔奖为目标，偏离了寻求科学发现的宗旨。
    美国哥伦比亚大学的苏克曼博士在其《科学精英》一书中，也对诺贝尔奖产生的一些问题进行了讨论。诺贝尔奖采取提名甄选的方法。每一位前获奖人都有向诺贝尔委员会提名的资格。由委员会从获提名者中选定得奖人。有些研究所或大学拥有多名诺贝尔奖得主。他们可以有效地为本部门或他们的朋友和合作者进行举荐。有些部门或个人为获提名则千方百计四处活动，把宝贵的精力浪费在与科学无关的游说中。苏克曼还指出，许多科学家获奖后，科研成果锐减也是一个事实。
    科学的真谛在于服务人类。而许多科学家和研究机构相互封锁信息。有些人为了获奖则抢先将尚未成熟的研究发表。甚至有人公然剽窃和欺骗。
    当然，把学术界的不良现象全部归咎于诺贝尔奖是不公平的。诺贝尔奖对科技发展和人类文明的进步有积极作用，这不应否认。但是对于诺贝尔奖存在的缺陷，人们也有理由提出置疑。
