    Sectarian clashes in northern India have been escalating, with 145 people killed since October 15.

    This large-scale sectarian conflict is between Hindus and Muslims. In Ayodhya town, Uttar Pradesh, there is a mosque. Hindus claim that the site was originally the birthplace of a Hindu deity, which was taken over by a Muslim mosque in the mid-16th century. Muslims, however, assert that the land has always belonged to them. Both sides have engaged in multiple bloody conflicts over this holy site.

    Recently, Hindus have been transporting bricks to the area, preparing for a groundbreaking ceremony for a Hindu temple on November 9. Muslims, upon hearing the news, rushed to block the construction, leading to violent clashes. Several towns in Bihar state have been plunged into a state of terror.

    On October 26, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi ordered a ban on religious ceremonies in sensitive areas of Bihar. The government has also deployed a large number of military and police forces to enhance security.

    印度北部连续发生教族冲突
    印度北部的教族冲突不断扩展，自十月十五日以来，已有一百四十五人丧生。                                
    这次大规模的教族冲突发生在印度教徒和穆斯林之间。在北方邦的阿约迪亚镇，有一座清真寺。印度教徒说这座寺址原是一印度教主诞生地，十六世纪中期被穆斯林清真寺所占用。而穆斯林认为，这块地盘自古就归他们所有。双方曾为争夺这块圣地多次发生流血冲突。
    近日来，印度教徒从各地往该地运砖，准备于十一月九日举行建造印度教大庙奠基仪式。而穆斯林闻讯赶来阻止，双方发生了流血冲突，比哈尔邦不少城镇陷入一片恐怖气氛中。
    十月二十六日拉·甘地总理下令在比哈尔邦敏感地区禁止举行宗教仪式。政府还派了大批军警以加强戒备。
