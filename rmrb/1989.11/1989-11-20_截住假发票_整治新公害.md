A new social malady is spreading: some companies, stores, and hotels issue fake invoices to make illicit profits; some officials and purchasing agents use fake invoices to embezzle funds; some enterprises use fake invoices to acquire rationed goods for employee benefits. This phenomenon not only disrupts normal economic order and corrupts social morals but also exposes loopholes in the financial auditing and reimbursement systems of some units and enterprises. Economic experts urge all regions and departments to take unified action to block the sources and channels of fake invoices and jointly combat this new malady.

Currently, the pretexts and methods for issuing fake invoices are numerous and varied. Some stores deliberately list daily necessities as automobile parts, high-end sunglasses as "sunshades," and rationed tape recorders as "sounders." Some individual and collective hotels, to attract customers and increase income, lump together dining and other fees as accommodation charges. Even some enterprises, in violation of state regulations, distribute goods to employees and, to evade audits and inspections by relevant departments, falsify invoices: electric rice cookers and copper hot pots become "preheaters," leather jackets, shoes, and cloth become "tarpaulins" and "footrests," and liquor becomes "antifreeze."

It is understood that the issuance of fake invoices by collective units is more severe than by state-owned units, and individual stores are more severe than collective units.

The reporter learned that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Audit Bureau, in conjunction with the tax and transportation departments, conducted an audit investigation of 955 collective, individual, and some state-owned enterprises in the seats of 12 leagues and cities in the region. They uncovered 28,112 fake invoices with a total falsified amount of 2.67 million yuan. Recently, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government issued a notice requiring all regions and departments to, by the end of the year, conduct a comprehensive audit of invoice management and usage as part of the financial inspection. All falsified amounts must be confiscated, and legal responsibility must be pursued against the manufacturers and beneficiaries of the fake invoices.

Economic experts believe that the phenomenon of issuing fake invoices is widespread across the country, and relying on partial regional crackdowns and rectification will not completely eradicate the problem.

    截住假发票　整治新公害
    新华社记者　汤计
    时下有一种新公害在社会上蔓延：一些公司、商店、旅社为顾客填开假发票赚昧心钱；一些干部、购销人员拿着假发票在单位报销中饱私囊；一些企业则利用假发票购置控购商品，为职工“谋福利”。这一现象不仅干扰了经济生活的正常秩序，毒化了社会风气，而且暴露出一些单位和企业的财务审计和报销制度漏洞百出。经济界有关人士吁请各地各部门采取一致行动，截堵假发票流行的源头和渠道，共同整治新公害。
    目前，一些单位、企业填开假发票的名目繁多，手法杂呈。有的商店将购买生活用品的发票故意开成汽车配件，把高档变色眼镜开成汽车的“遮光板”，把控购的收录机开成“巡响器”。一些个体和集体旅社为了招徕顾客，增加收入，竟把旅客在旅社的就餐费和其他费用一并开成住宿费。甚至，一些企业违反国家有关规定给职工发实物，为了逃避有关部门的审计和检查，就在发票上做手脚：电饭锅、铜火锅在发票上变成了“预热器”，皮夹克、皮鞋、呢料变成了“苫布”、“脚踏板”，白酒变成了“防冻液”。
    据了解，给顾客填开假发票的商店和旅馆中，集体单位要比国营单位严重，个体商店又比集体单位严重。
    记者获悉，内蒙古自治区审计局已会同税务、交通部门对全区12个盟市所在地的955个集体、个体和部分国营企业进行了审计调查，查出各种假发票28112张，作假金额达267万元。近日，内蒙古自治区人民政府已发出通知，要求各地区、各部门在年底前结合财务大检查，对发票管理与使用情况进行一次全面检查，对作假的款项要全部没收，并追究假发票制造者和受益者的法律责任。
    经济界有关人士认为，填开假发票现象全国各地都有，靠部分地区的截堵整治是难以让假发票“断子绝孙”的。
