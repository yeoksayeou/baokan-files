Tennis star Peter Dvorsky is a star on the Czech and Slovak opera stage. Music critics praise him as one of the world's top four male sopranos today, on par with Pavarotti, Domingo, and Carreras.

Peter Dvorsky was born in 1951 in the village of Horná Ves in central Slovakia. At the age of 11, he began studying piano at the People's Art School. His teacher discovered that he not only had a great talent for the piano but also possessed a promising voice. Therefore, he suggested that Peter apply to the Bratislava Music Academy to study vocal music. Initially, Peter's parents were unwilling to let him pursue this career, but after much persuasion, they reluctantly agreed to let him try. Peter passed the entrance exam with flying colors and was admitted to this prestigious music institution.

Professor Ida Selnecka recalled Dvorsky's early years of study, saying that during his first two years at the academy, Peter was a baritone. By the end of his second year, his voice began to gradually rise. Towards the end of his third year, he once asked his teacher to listen to him sing an aria. Before the song ended, the professor was astonished to discover that standing before him was a rare male soprano.

Dvorsky graduated from the Bratislava Music Academy in 1972. In his final year, he was already recruited by the Slovak National Theatre Opera Company and became a soloist. In June 1975, he went to Milan's "La Scala" Theatre to compete for the opportunity to study and perform there for a short period. After the audition, the judges selected 4 out of 60 contestants. Dvorsky was one of them. The door to the world was thus opened.

The following year, he toured Austria with the Slovak National Theatre Opera Company. Vienna is a world-renowned music city with a highly cultured population. Dvorsky was highly favored here, demonstrating his remarkable talent. Soon after, he was hired as a soloist at the Vienna State Opera. Later, he visited many countries in Europe, America, and Asia and was invited by many famous opera companies to perform. He has collaborated successfully with many renowned conductors, directors, and singers. He has sung masterpieces by Strauss, Verdi, and Puccini in different languages, as well as works by many other famous composers from Italy, France, Russia, Czech, and Slovakia. To date, he has performed over 1000 opera shows.

World-renowned tenor Plácido Domingo has high praise for Dvorsky, saying that Dvorsky is the only contemporary male soprano he knows who can sing Puccini's "La Bohème" aria "Che gelida manina" in the correct key, while he and Pavarotti cannot reach that high.

Dvorsky takes every performance very seriously. He always sings with his whole heart and never takes it lightly. He believes that it is not easy to be a good opera singer today, and without real talent, it is impossible to gain the audience's recognition.

    “世界四大男高音”之一  德沃尔斯基
    本报记者　许宏治
    男高音歌唱家彼得·德沃尔斯基是捷克斯洛伐克歌剧舞台上的明星。音乐评论家们称誉他是当代世界最杰出的四大男高音之一，可与帕瓦罗蒂、多明戈、卡雷拉斯齐名。
    彼得·德沃尔斯基于1951年出生在中斯洛伐克一个名叫霍尔纳维斯的村庄。他11岁时开始在人民艺术学校学习钢琴。他的老师发现他不仅在钢琴方面天赋甚高，而且有一副很有前途的好嗓子，因此建议他报考布拉迪斯拉发音乐学院，改学声乐。父母起初不愿让彼得从事这一行，后经一再央求，才勉强同意他去试试。彼得一举成功，顺利通过考试，进入了这所高等音乐学府。
    伊达·塞尔内卡教授回忆德沃尔斯基最初几年的学习情况时说，来到学院的头两年，彼得是男中音。第二学年末，他的嗓子音调开始逐渐变高。第三学年快结束时，有一次，他向老师提出，希望老师听他试唱一首咏叹调。一曲未了，教授已惊异地发现，站在面前的是一位难得的男高音。
    德沃尔斯基于1972年从布拉迪斯拉发音乐学院毕业。在毕业前一年他已被斯洛伐克民族剧院歌剧团看中，从而成为该团独唱演员。1975年6月，他前往意大利米兰“斯卡拉”剧院，参加角逐在该院短期学习、演出的机会。试听后，评委从60名参赛者中选中4名。德沃尔斯基是其中之一。走向世界的大门从此打开。
    第二年，他随斯洛伐克民族剧院歌剧团访问奥地利。维也纳是世界著名的音乐城，人们的音乐素养很高，德沃尔斯基在这里备受青睐，可见功力不凡。他不久被聘为维也纳国家歌剧院的独唱演员。后来，他还到过欧洲、美洲、亚洲的许多国家，被世界上不少著名歌剧团聘为特邀演员，与许多著名指挥、导演及歌唱家进行过成功的合作。他曾用不同的语言演唱过施特劳斯、威尔第和普契尼等大师的名作，以及意大利、法国、俄国、捷克和斯洛伐克其他许多名家的作品。到现在，他演出的歌剧已超过1000场。
    世界著名男高音歌唱家普拉西多·多明戈对德沃尔斯基评价很高，说德沃尔斯基是他所知道的唯一能按规定调来演唱普契尼的《波希米亚人》中鲁道夫咏叹调的当代男高音演员，而他本人和帕瓦罗蒂都唱不到那么高。
    德沃尔斯基对每一次演出都非常认真。他总是用整个身心去演唱，从不马马虎虎。他认为，现在要当好一名歌剧演员是不容易的，没有真本事是不可能得到听众承认的。（附图片）
