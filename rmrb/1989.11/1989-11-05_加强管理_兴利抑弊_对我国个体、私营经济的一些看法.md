Individual and private economies have faced various problems during their development. How should we analyze, view, and solve these problems? With this question in mind, we conducted a two-month investigation from mid-July to early September on the development status and existing problems of individual and private enterprises in Beijing, Shanghai, Heilongjiang, Dalian, Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang.

Ten Years of Development and Current Status

Allowing the existence and development of individual economies was a correct decision made ten years ago in China. After the Gang of Four was smashed, while restoring the national economy, solving the employment problem for a large number of re-urbanized youth and other personnel became an urgent task. In the absence of sufficient employment opportunities provided by the state, the government encouraged people to seek jobs through multiple channels and created various convenient conditions. This is the initial reason why individual economies were restored and developed after the Cultural Revolution.

Over the past ten years, the positive role of individual and private economies has been fully demonstrated, mainly in the following aspects:

1. Providing a large number of employment opportunities for society;
2. Supplementing the shortcomings of state-owned and collective economies, playing a role in filling gaps, and facilitating people's lives by meeting the diverse needs of society;
3. Activating the socialist planned commodity economy and accumulating a certain amount of funds for the state. From 1981 to 1988, individual and private economies cumulatively paid taxes amounting to 30.952 billion yuan, and the individual industrial and commercial tax revenue in 1989 is expected to reach 12 billion yuan.
4. Playing a positive role in maintaining social stability. Individual and private economies act as a "reservoir." When social employment is tight, they can absorb a large number of people, and when employment opportunities increase, they can transfer a large number of laborers.

Current Main Problems

Currently, the main problems in the development of individual and private economies are as follows:

1. High income. A survey of 1,000 households in Liaoning Province's Yingkou City showed that the average monthly net income of individual households in 1988 was 358.8 yuan, 1.6 times the income of local employed workers. In Beijing, based on a typical survey in 1988, the actual monthly income of individual households was around 629 yuan, approximately 3.8 times the average monthly wage income of all workers in the city. According to a sample survey in Guangzhou, the average monthly income of individual households is 3 to 4 times the average monthly wage income of employed workers.

2. Weak legal awareness, with issues such as shortchanging, adulteration, market bullying, price gouging, forced buying and selling, and exceeding the scope of business operations occurring frequently.

3. To avoid taxes and industrial and commercial management, many individual households and private enterprises use various means to obtain business licenses from collective enterprises, enjoying national preferential policies in taxation, credit, energy, and raw material supply.

4. Tax evasion is widespread and substantial. In 1988, Jiangsu Province inspected 293,222 individual households and found that 154,864 had tax evasion behaviors, accounting for 52.8%. In Shanghai, during a key inspection of individual households, it was found that 90% had tax evasion, with 98.5% in Zhabei District alone. In terms of the amount of tax evasion, it is generally large. For example, in Zhejiang Province's Huangyan Small Commodity Market, the business volume in 1988 was 2.4 billion yuan, with only 12.7 million yuan in taxes collected. According to the tax collection ratio set by the provincial tax bureau, 75% of the taxes were evaded.

5. The current structure, scale, and income level of individual and private economies deviate from the state's guidance.

The state's original intention in encouraging the development of individual economies was to let individual households engage in industries that state-owned and collective enterprises cannot cover but are essential for people's daily lives, such as catering, services, repairs, and handicrafts. From the current industry structure, the proportion of households engaged in commerce nationwide accounts for more than half, and many places are developing towards large department stores, while catering and services together account for only 15.5%. In terms of personnel composition, the original intention was mainly to solve the employment problem of urban unemployed youth and idle people in society, but currently, the composition of individual industrial and commercial households includes an increasing number of people on leave with pay, retirees, and workers from factory optimizations. In terms of scale, individual economies are no longer the small-scale businesses people originally imagined. Individual households' funds are continuously increasing. In 1988, the average funds per household nationwide were over 2,000 yuan. By the end of 1987, there were 225,000 private industrial and commercial households with more than 8 employees and funds exceeding 80,000 yuan. In terms of income level, individual industrial and commercial households are not just individual laborers maintaining their livelihoods and supporting their families, but there are also "millionaires" who have become rich in a short period. Some have become millionaires or even billionaires in a few years. Many individual households, after getting rich, indulge in extravagance and waste, frequenting hotels, bars, and dance halls, eating, drinking, gambling, and engaging in all sorts of vices, even taking concubines, which has a very bad influence and corrupting effect on society.

Roots of the Problems

The root causes of the various problems in the development of individual and private economies are:

1. Unclear guiding ideology. The original motivation for developing individual economies was to solve urban employment problems, but issues such as how to develop individual economies, to what extent, and in which direction were not clearly answered at the beginning. Even today, there is only a lower limit (8 people) for the number of employees in private enterprises, with no upper limit. Due to the lack of clarity in theory and policy on these issues, under employment pressure, the focus of various levels of government in the past few years has been on encouraging and supporting the development of individual economies, even using the speed of individual economic development as a measure of work achievements, with little consideration of how to strengthen supervision of individual and private economies.

2. The policies and measures to encourage the development of individual and private economies are in contradiction with the existing economic system, that is, the development of individual and private economies lacks normal channels. For example, in areas such as bank loans, tax management, land use, energy, and raw material supply, no normal channels have been opened for individual and private economic components, making them only able to survive in the gaps. However, on the other hand, under the dual-track system of planning and pricing, the existence and development of individual and private economies have opportunities. Thus, under the environment of encouraging the development of individual and private economies, individual economies have also developed through various supporting measures and loopholes in the dual-track system.

3. Incomplete regulations and lax enforcement. Since 1981, several policies and regulations for managing individual and private economies have been issued. However, currently, there are two problems: one is that the regulations themselves are not perfect, and the other is that actual enforcement is weak. For example, the "Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises" have been promulgated, but the implementation rules for aspects such as enterprise financial management and labor management have not yet been established, thus lacking consistency in the management of private enterprises. Again, the "Provisional Regulations on Individual Industrial and Commercial Household Income Tax" stipulate that a ten-level progressive tax is levied on individual households, with the guiding ideology of adjusting the excessively high income of individual households and preventing a part of them from becoming rich. However, in actual work, this regulation has not been implemented.

4. The management system is disordered, and there is a lack of coordination among departments. The management of individual and private economies currently involves economic supervision and regulation agencies such as industrial and commercial, taxation, pricing, public security, urban construction, transportation, and health, as well as professional administrative management departments. In fact, for a long time, the management of individual economies has been in a chaotic situation where everyone manages and no one manages. Everyone is willing to collect fees, but no one wants to take responsibility when problems arise.

In addition, the management force is seriously insufficient, and the inherent duality of individual and private economies has also brought about some problems.

Strengthening Management and Guiding Development

The core issue in the development of individual and private economies is that management work has not kept up. Therefore, the current urgent task is how to pay attention to promoting benefits and suppressing harm, and strengthening management while guiding development in the process of development.

We believe that in strengthening management, three issues need to be addressed:

1. Reaffirm the relevant policies allowing the development of individual and private economies, making it clear to people that this is a long-term, unchanging policy for the primary stage of socialism and will not be reversed or shaken.

2. For those who have already become rich, appropriate measures should be taken. For example, a personal income adjustment tax should be levied on these large households, and they should be guided to use their funds for expanding reproduction and public welfare. For those who spend money on consumption, purchasing cars, building luxurious houses, or even building tombs, property tax or consumption tax should be gradually levied to recover the funds.

3. Adjust policies appropriately. The scope of operations for individual and private enterprises should be strictly limited. For those engaged in individual and private economies, restrictions should be imposed, and those with jobs should not take away the livelihood of the jobless. For individual households with employees, a tax regulation different from general individual households should be formulated. Past regulations on the supply of raw materials and other aspects for individual households and private enterprises should be strictly enforced, providing them with legitimate channels for operation. To truly manage individual and private economies, we believe that the management system should be streamlined, changing the situation of everyone managing and no one managing. The practice of replacing management with fees should be strictly prohibited, and the fee amount should be nationally unified. Strict punishment clauses should be implemented. At the same time, the enforcement powers of departments such as taxation and industrial and commercial should be appropriately expanded, making their enforcement measures more stringent. Strengthen propaganda to improve the transparency of policies, regulations, and enforcement.

    加强管理　兴利抑弊
    ——对我国个体、私营经济的一些看法
    武树帜　陈吉江
    个体、私营经济在发展中究竟存在哪些问题？应如何分析、看待和解决这些问题？带着这一课题，我们从7月中旬到9月初，对北京、上海、黑龙江、大连、广东、福建、浙江等省市的个体工商户和私营企业的发展状况及存在的问题，进行了为期两个月的调查。
    十年发展及现状
    允许个体经济的存在和发展，这是十年前我国作出的一项正确决策。粉碎“四人帮”以后，在恢复国民经济的同时，解决大批回城知识青年等人员的社会就业问题，成为十分紧迫的任务。在国家不能提供充足的就业机会情况下，政府鼓励人们多渠道自谋职业，并创造了各种方便条件。这就是我国个体经济在“文革”后得以恢复和发展的初始动因。
    经过十年发展，个体、私营经济的积极作用也充分显示出来，主要体现在以下几个方面：
    一、为社会提供了大量就业机会；
      二、补充国营、集体经济的不足，起到了拾遗补缺的作用，方便了群众生活，满足了社会多样化的需求；
    三、活跃了社会主义有计划的商品经济，为国家积累了一定数量的资金。1981年到1988年，个体、私营经济累积纳税309.52亿元，1989年的个体工商税收可望达到120亿元。
    四、对社会的安定起了积极作用。个体、私营经济是一个“蓄水池”，当社会就业紧张时，它可大量吸纳一部分人就业，一旦就业机会增多时，它又可转移出大批劳动力。
    现存的主要问题
    目前，个体、私营经济在发展中存在的主要问题表现在如下几个方面：
    收入偏高。辽宁省营口市的千户调查表明，个体户1988年纯收入月均358.8元，是当地在职职工收入的1.6倍；北京市1988年根据典型调查测算出个体户实际收入每月在629元左右，平均约为全市职工实际工资性收入的3.8倍；根据广州市的抽样调查，个体户月均收入相当于在职职工平均月工资性收入的3—4倍。
    法制观念淡薄，缺斤少两、掺杂使假、欺行霸市、哄抬物价、强买强卖及超范围经营问题时有发生。
    为了逃避税收和工商管理，许多个体户、私营企业通过各种手段领取集体企业的《营业执照》，享受国家在税收、信贷、能源及原材料供应上的优惠政策。
    偷漏税收面广额大。
      江苏省1988年对293222户个体户进行检查，发现154864户有偷漏税行为，占52.8％；上海市在对个体户的重点检查中，发现有偷漏税的占90％，其中闸北区重点查了2429户，有偷漏税的占98.5％。从偷漏额来看，一般也很大，如浙江省黄岩小商品市场，1988年营业额2.4亿元，税收仅127万元，按省税务局规定的征收比例，有75％的税收被漏掉了。
    个体、私营经济目前的结构、规模及收入水准与国家的引导相脱离。
    国家鼓励发展个体经济的出发点是让个体户从事那些国营、集体企业包不下来、人民群众在日常生活中又离不开的行业，如饮食、服务、修理、手工业等。从目前的行业结构看，全国从事商业的户数比重占一半以上，不少地方正朝大百货方向发展，而饮食、服务业两项合计才占15.5％。从人员构成上看，当初的出发点主要是安置城镇待业青年和社会闲散人员的就业问题，而目前个体工商户的队伍中，停薪留职人员、离退休人员、工厂优化组合的工人等成份不断增加。从规模看，个体经济已不再是人们原来设想的那种小本经营，个体户拥有的资金不断增大。1988年全国户均拥有资金2000多元。1987年底，雇工在8人以上、资金在8万元以上的私人工商户有22.5万户。从收入水平看，个体工商户中不仅是维持生计和养家糊口的个体劳动者，而“腰缠万贯”的万元户已不是少数。有的在短短几年中就暴发为百万元户甚至千万元户。有不少个体户发家之后，挥霍浪费，出入宾馆、酒吧、舞厅，吃喝嫖赌，无所不为，甚至纳亲娶小，给社会带来极坏影响和腐蚀作用。
    问题产生的根源
    个体、私营经济发展中出现以上种种问题的根源主要是：
    指导思想不够明确。发展个体经济的原始动因是为了解决城镇就业问题，但诸如让个体经济如何发展，发展到何种程度，往哪里发展等等问题，当初并无明确的答案。时于今日，对私营企业的雇工规定也只有下限（8人）而无上限。由于从理论到政策上对这些问题都不明确，在就业的压力下，前几年各级政府的注意力也都放在鼓励扶持个体经济的发展上，甚至把个体经济发展快慢作为工作成就加以渲染，很少考虑如何对个体私营经济加强监督的问题。
    鼓励个体、私营经济发展的政策措施与现行的经济体制相矛盾，即个体、私营经济的发展缺乏正常渠道。如银行信贷、税收管理、土地使用、能源及原材料的供应等方面，都没有为个体私营经济成份开辟正常途径，使之只能在夹缝中生存。但另一方面，在计划、价格双轨制的条件下，使个体、私营经济的存在和发展又有可乘之机。于是在鼓励个体、私营经济发展的环境之下，个体经济也就通过各种扶持和钻“双轨制”空子等非正当途径发展起来。
    法规不完善，执行不严格。1981年以来，陆续出台了一些对个体、私营经济管理的政策法规。但从目前来看还存在两个问题：一是法规本身尚不完善，二是实际贯彻执行不力。如《私营企业暂行条例》已颁布，但诸如企业的财务管理和劳动管理等方面的实施细则都还没有，这样就对私营企业的管理缺乏一致性。又如已出台的《城乡个体工商户所得税暂行条例》规定，对个体户采用十级超额累进税，指导思想是要调节个体户的过高收入，防止一部分人暴富。但在实际工作中，却没有按这一法规执行。
    管理体制不顺，部门之间配合不力。对个体、私营经济管理，目前涉及到工商、税务、物价、公安、城建、交通、卫生等经济监督调节机构以及专业行政管理部门，实际上，长期以来对个体经济的管理是处于大家都管、大家都不管的混乱局面。收费时大家都愿管，一有问题谁都不想揽。
    另外，管理力量严重不足，个体和私营经济所固有的两面性，也带来了一些问题。
    加强管理　引导发展
    个体、私营经济发展中出现的各种问题，核心的问题是管理工作没跟上。因此，目前的当务之急是怎样在发展的过程中注意兴利抑弊、加强管理，在加强管理的同时引导发展。
    我们认为在加强管理中要解决好三个问题：
    一是重申允许个体经济和私营经济发展的有关政策，使人们明确，这是社会主义初级阶段的一项长期不变的方针，不会有反复或动摇。
    二是对已经暴富起来的人应采取妥善办法。如对这些大户开征个人收入调节税，并引导他们把资金用在扩大再生产和社会公益事业上。对那些把钱花在消费上，购置小汽车、建造豪华住宅甚至修筑坟墓者，应通过财产税或消费税逐步收回。
    三是适当调整政策。对个体、私营企业的经营范围应严格限制，对于从事个体、私营经济的人员要限制，不能让有职业的人去抢无职业者的饭碗，对雇工的个体大户，应制定一个区别于一般个体户税收的规定。对过去作出的某些对个体户和私营企业在原材料供应等方面的规定应坚持执行，要给这部分人正当的经营途径；为了真正把个体私营经济管起来，我们认为还应理顺管理体制，改变都管都不管的局面。改以费代管为收支分流。严令禁止乱收费，收费额度必须全国统一。严格处罚条款。与此同时，对税务、工商等部门的执法权限也要适当扩大，使其执法手段硬化。加强宣传，提高政策法规与执法的透明度。
