    Recently, Qinghai Province uncovered a major embezzlement and bribery case involving Golmud City Deputy Mayor Yang Wenshan and others, who have been arrested. Two former mayors are currently under investigation by the procuratorial authorities.

    The Kekexili region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, under the jurisdiction of Golmud City, is rich in gold sand resources. In recent years, it has attracted a large number of farmers from eastern Qinghai to come and mine gold. The relevant departments of the city have utilized some "gold bosses" to assist in gold mining management. The "gold bosses" took the opportunity to sell gold mining permits to gold farmers at high prices, amassing great wealth. Some government officials colluded with the "gold bosses," creating chaos in gold mining management, embezzling and accepting bribes, extorting and harming gold farmers, and plundering state assets. The procuratorial and supervisory departments of Qinghai Province have made significant progress in investigating this major embezzlement and bribery case. So far, they have seized more than 10 million yuan in illicit funds and items, and found a large amount of gold sand in the homes of some criminals. The case has preliminarily identified more than 30 state officials and enterprise employees involved. Deputy Mayor of Golmud City and Director of the Public Security Bureau Yang Wenshan, Deputy Manager of the City Gold Company Jing Zhimou, Director of the City Government Office Liu Fuxiang, and some "gold bosses" have been arrested. Deputy Mayor of Golmud City Shi Yi, Director of the Provincial Gazette Office and former Mayor of Golmud City Han Dexiang, and former Mayor of Golmud City Liu Xiaofeng are under investigation by the Golmud City People's Procuratorate.
