The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China issued a communiqué. It unanimously supports all the decisions made at the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee. It calls for concentrating efforts on enforcing Party discipline and improving Party conduct.

	The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing from November 10 to 12, 1989.

	Sixty-seven members of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection attended the session. Relevant leaders attended the meeting as non-voting participants. The main agenda was to study and implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee and to discuss how to strengthen the work of Party discipline inspection in the process of further rectification and deepening reform.

	Comrade Qiao Shi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, presided over the meeting and delivered an important speech.

	The plenary session unanimously supports the decision made by the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Further Rectification and Deepening Reform." The plenary session believes that this decision fully affirms the line, principles, and policies of the Party since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, and the great achievements made in economic construction, reform and opening up, and various undertakings. It correctly summarizes the experience of economic work in recent years, objectively assesses and analyzes the current problems, difficulties, and favorable conditions, and proposes the guiding principles, main tasks, and basic measures for further rectification and deepening reform. This is of great guiding significance for achieving sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy. All levels of Party organizations, all Party members and cadres, and Communist Party members must, with a high sense of Party spirit and organizational discipline, resolutely implement and carry out these decisions.

	The plenary session unanimously supports the decision made by the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee to approve Comrade Deng Xiaoping's resignation from the position of Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the CPC. It unanimously agrees with the evaluation made by the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great contributions to the Chinese revolution and construction. He is indeed an outstanding Marxist, a steadfast communist, an outstanding proletarian revolutionary, statesman, and military strategist, and a tested leader of our Party, state, and army. The plenary session believes that Comrade Deng Xiaoping, starting from the fundamental interests of the Party and the state, has realized his long-standing wish to completely step down from his leadership position while still in good health. This shows the broad-mindedness of a great proletarian revolutionary. All participants at the meeting express their profound respect for Comrade Deng Xiaoping's personal example in advocating the abolition of the lifelong tenure of leading cadres. The plenary session emphasizes that since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the ideological line, political line, and organizational line formulated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping together with the Central Committee are Marxist lines that suit China's national conditions. We must unswervingly implement and carry them out.

	The plenary session unanimously supports the decision made by the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee to appoint Comrade Jiang Zemin as Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the CPC, Comrade Yang Shangkun as First Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the CPC, Comrade Liu Huaqing as Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the CPC, and Comrade Yang Baibing as Secretary of the Central Military Commission of the CPC, and to add Comrade Yang Baibing as a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee.

	The plenary session stresses that in the process of rectification and deepening reform, we must strengthen the democratic centralism of the Party, enhance the discipline of the Party, oppose localism and separatism, and maintain the unity and stability of the Party. All levels of discipline inspection organs must unswervingly adhere to the four cardinal principles, oppose bourgeois liberalization, and effectively supervise and inspect the implementation of central decisions by Party organizations and leading cadres. We must uphold and maintain the seriousness of Party discipline, ensure that the whole Party acts in unison in rectification and deepening reform. We must resolutely implement the policy of strict governance of the Party, seriously investigate and deal with Party disciplinary cases, focus on investigating and dealing with major and important cases, eliminate corrupt elements within the Party, and maintain the purity of the Party's ranks. We must concentrate our efforts on enforcing Party discipline, assist Party committees in improving Party conduct, combat corruption, maintain integrity, continue to carry forward the fine traditions and style of the Party, and ensure that the Party always maintains the nature and spirit of the vanguard of the working class.

	The plenary session, by secret ballot, elected new members of the Standing Committee of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC.

	The plenary session calls on all levels of discipline inspection organs and all discipline inspection cadres to seriously study the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, unify their thoughts, strengthen their confidence, invigorate their spirits, work hard, and perform their duties. With effective work, they will ensure the achievement of the goals of further rectification and deepening reform.
