    Foreign investment in China continues to develop
    Over 4,000 new foreign-funded enterprises approved this year
    Over 800 foreign-funded enterprises to showcase their achievements in Beijing

    According to a report from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, from January to September this year, China approved 4,281 new foreign-funded enterprises. The agreed foreign investment amounted to $4.006 billion, and the actual investment reached $2.016 billion. These figures represent increases of 16%, 19%, and 29.3% respectively compared to the same period last year.

    Despite the impact of the events in Beijing during the spring and summer on the utilization of foreign capital, China's commitment to opening up and stable policies have ensured the continued development of foreign investment. By the end of September, China had approved over 20,000 foreign-funded enterprises in the past decade, with foreign investors committing $32.171 billion and actually investing $14.118 billion. Currently, over 8,000 foreign-funded enterprises have been established and are in operation, with more than 85% of these enterprises operating normally and achieving good investment returns.

    These enterprises have promoted the development of China's national economy. For example, projects such as offshore oil exploration and development, the Daya Bay nuclear power plant, the Pinglu open-pit coal mine, and the Guangzhou-Shenzhen expressway have strengthened China's weak economic sectors in energy, transportation, and raw materials.

    Foreign-funded enterprises have introduced advanced technologies, updated products, and expanded export capabilities. In 1988 alone, the export value reached approximately $2.46 billion; in the first nine months of this year, the export value has already exceeded $3 billion.

    These enterprises have also provided valuable management experiences for China, increased revenue for the central and local governments, created approximately 2 million jobs, and trained a large number of professionals skilled in international business operations.

    To showcase the achievements of foreign-funded enterprises over the past decade, the State Council has approved the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, the State Council's Special Economic Zones Office, and the State Planning Commission to hold a 7-day exhibition from November 9 to 15 at the China International Exhibition Center in Beijing. Over 850 foreign-funded enterprises from 39 provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, special economic zones, and planned cities will participate in the exhibition.

    今年外商来华投资持续发展
    我新批准外资企业逾四千家
    八百多家外资企业成果即将在京亮相
    本报讯  记者刘霄从经贸部获悉，今年1至9月，我国新批准外资企业4281家，外商投资协议金额40.06亿美元，实际投入金额20.16亿美元，分别比去年同期增长16％、19％和29.3％。
    尽管北京春夏之交发生的事件使利用外资工作受到一定程度的影响，但是由于我国坚持对外开放，政策稳定，吸收外资的工作仍然持续发展。截至9月底，我国10年来批准的外资企业已经超过2万家，外商申请投入金额321.71亿美元，实际投资141.18亿美元。目前建成并投入生产运营的外资企业已达8000多家，其中85％以上的企业运营情况正常，取得了较好的投资效益。
    这些企业促进了我国国民经济建设的发展。例如海上石油勘探开发项目、大亚湾核电站、平朔露天煤矿、广深高速公路等能源、交通、原材料工业项目，加强了我国经济的薄弱环节。
    外资企业引进了技术，更新了产品，扩大了出口能力，仅1988年出口额约达24.6亿美元；今年前9个月，出口额已超过30亿美元。
    这些企业的科学管理，为我国提供了可资借鉴的经验，它们为中央和地方财政增加了收入，为大约200万人创造了就业机会，培养了一大批懂得举办跨国公司业务的人才。
    为了展示外资企业10年来的成果，经国务院批准，经贸部、国务院特区办和国家计委将于11月9日至15日，在北京的中国国际贸易展览中心举办为期7天的展览会，39个省、市、自治区、经济特区、计划单列市的850多家外资企业参展。
