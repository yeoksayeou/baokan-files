Yang Shangkun, on behalf of the new Central Military Commission leadership, extended sincere congratulations to all officers and soldiers of the Air Force. He said: Our Air Force has grown from nothing to something, from small to large, from a single type of aircraft to multiple types, and from a very small scale to a considerable scale, becoming an important force in defending the motherland.

The meeting was presided over by Air Force Political Commissar Zhu Guang. Air Force Commander Wang Hai delivered a speech. He expressed that all officers and soldiers of the Air Force strongly support the various decisions and resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. These decisions are of great and far-reaching significance for ensuring that our country continues to advance along the socialist path, for strengthening the Party's leadership and ensuring the long-term stability and prosperity of the country, and for continuing to promote the revolutionary, modern, and regularized construction of our army.

Over the past 40 years, the People's Air Force, through the joint efforts of several generations, has established outstanding achievements in resisting aggression, air defense, and supporting national construction. This modern technical force composed of multiple arms and aircraft has become an iron wall defending the country's airspace and a powerful force supporting socialist construction.

Commander Wang Hai expressed that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, we will unite and strive together to further strengthen the revolutionary, modern, and regularized construction of the People's Air Force.

Leaders from various departments of the People's Liberation Army, the Military Commission Discipline Inspection Commission, various military branches, military academies, and over 2,000 people from the Air Force headquarters and units stationed in Beijing attended today's commemorative meeting.
