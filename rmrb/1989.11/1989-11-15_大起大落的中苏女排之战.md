At 1:30 PM on November 14, the China-Soviet women's volleyball match began at the Nagoya Comprehensive Gymnasium.

Both teams' lineups were revealed. China's team featured familiar main players: Su Huijuan, Lai Yawen, Li Guojun, Xu Xin, Wu Dan, and Li Yueling. The Soviet team's lineup was nearly identical to their Olympic championship team, missing only one player.

The four-set match was filled with ups and downs. China won the first set 15-7, but the Soviet team tied the score at 1-1 with a 15-10 victory in the second set. The fourth set saw the most dramatic swings. China led 4-0 but then the Soviet team scored nine consecutive points to take a 4-9 lead. When China fell behind 6-13, they rallied to tie the score at 13-13. The Soviet team then secured two powerful spikes to win the set. The fluctuating scores exposed the Chinese players' youth, volatility, and lack of maturity.

Looking at the total points from the four sets, China scored 52 points, while the Soviet team scored 53, a difference of just 1 point. Technical statistics reveal the reasons for China's loss. Firstly, there was a gap in offensive power. Except for the first set, where China's spike points were higher than the Soviet team's 6-4, the other three sets were lower. The Soviet team's No. 5, Semenova, scored multiple points with her back-row jumps and was even more threatening at the net, a stark contrast to her previous poor performances. Secondly, the success rates of the first pass and defense were 73.78% and 63.78% for China, respectively, compared to 81.85% and 78.78% for the Soviet team, showing a significant difference.

After the match, China's women's volleyball head coach Hu Jin met with reporters and said the main reason for the loss was that their offense didn't materialize, and there were too many receiving errors. Through competition with strong teams, it can be seen that the Chinese players lack international competition experience, and their techniques are still quite rough. However, major competitions are good opportunities to train young players.

Foreign journalists covering the event also had much to say about the China-Soviet women's volleyball match. A Japanese journalist said that he had previously vaguely thought that the Chinese and Soviet women's volleyball teams were equally matched, but through the match, he understood the strengths and weaknesses of both teams, believing this would also help the Chinese and Soviet teams to better understand each other and self-evaluate. A European journalist said that before the match, he thought the Soviet team was stronger than the Chinese team, but after watching the match, he felt there was a possibility of defeating the Soviet team.

    大起大落的中苏女排之战
    本报记者　于青
    11月14日下午1点30分，名古屋市综合体育馆内，中苏女排之战开始。
    双方阵容亮相。中国队出场的仍是人们熟悉的主力队员：苏惠娟、赖亚文、李国君、许新、巫丹、李月明。苏联队出场的与奥运会夺冠阵容只差一人。
    四局比赛，波澜起伏。第一局中国队以15∶7顺利取胜，第二局又被苏联队以15∶10扳成1平。第四局的起落幅度最大。中国队4∶0领先后，被苏队连得9分，打成4∶9。在6∶13落后的情况下，中国队连得7分，13平。此后，苏联队两记重扣得分取胜。大起大落的比分，暴露了中国选手年纪轻、易波动、不成熟的弱点。
    从四局小分总数看，中国队得52分，苏联队得53分，相差1分。从技术数据统计可以看出中国队失利的原因。首先是攻击力的差距。除在第一局中国队的扣球得分以6∶4高于苏联队外，其他3局都低于对手。苏队5号谢苗诺娃的后排起跳扣球多次得分，轮到前排更具威胁，与前几场比赛的失常表现判若两人。其次，一传和防守的成功率，中国队为73.78％和63.78％，苏联队为81.85％和78.78％。差距比较明显。
    比赛结束后，中国女排主教练胡进在会见记者时说，失利的主要原因是自己的进攻没有打出来，接发球失误过多。通过与强队的较量，可以看到中国队员缺乏国际比赛经验，技术还比较粗糙。但大型比赛正是锻炼年青队员的好机会。
    在此间采访的外国记者对中苏女排之战也议论纷纷。一位日本记者说，原来只笼统地认为中苏女排实力相当，通过比赛，了解了两队的长处和不足，相信这也有助于中苏两队的相互了解和自我估价。一位欧洲记者说，他赛前就认为苏联队实力强于中国队，看了比赛，又觉得有击败苏联队的可能性。
