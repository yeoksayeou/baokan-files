After completing the intense autumn harvest, more than sixty county (city, district) deputy secretaries or deputy county magistrates in charge of agriculture in Jiangxi Province have come to the provincial agricultural science academy to study new agricultural science knowledge.

This is part of the short-term training plan for "agricultural officials" implemented by the Jiangxi Provincial Government to achieve agricultural development through science and technology and to secure an even greater harvest next year.

It is reported that prior to this, the Jiangxi Provincial Government had already held a session of the Agricultural Development Seminar at Jiangxi Agricultural University, attended by county (city, district) leaders in charge of agriculture.
