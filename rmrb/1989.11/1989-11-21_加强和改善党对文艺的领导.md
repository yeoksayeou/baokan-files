	Upholding the Correct Direction and Promoting the Prosperity of Literary and Artistic Undertakings
	Strengthening and Improving the Party's Leadership Over Literature and the Arts
	Xia Zanzhong

	*Deng Xiaoping on Literature and the Arts* upholds the basic principles of Marxism and Mao Zedong's thoughts on literature and the arts, combining them with the practice of socialist literature and the arts in the new period. It provides profound insights into a series of important issues, including strengthening and improving the Party's leadership over literature and the arts. These insights are a summary of the Party's experience in correctly leading socialist literary and artistic undertakings and a theoretical generalization, representing an inheritance and development of Marxist literary theory and a new component of Mao Zedong's thoughts on literature and the arts. Studying *Deng Xiaoping on Literature and the Arts* thoroughly is of great significance for strengthening and improving the Party's leadership and promoting the prosperity of socialist literary and artistic undertakings.

	Strengthening the Party's leadership over literature and the arts is determined by the nature and tasks of socialist literature and the arts in our country. Socialism is an undeniable historical choice for the Chinese people. Our literature and the arts are socialist literature and the arts, just like other undertakings of our Party, they must adhere to the socialist direction and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. Their clear purpose is to serve the people and serve socialism. As Deng Xiaoping pointed out, they bear the important responsibility of meeting the diverse spiritual needs of the people, cultivating new socialist people, and raising the ideological, cultural, and moral standards of the entire society. The practice of revolutionary literature and the arts and socialist literature and the arts in our country has proven that only by adhering to and strengthening the Party's leadership can our literary and artistic undertakings prosper and develop healthily along the correct path. If the Party's leadership is relaxed, weakened, or abandoned, it is impossible to achieve true prosperity and development. From the revolutionary war period, with Lu Xun as a representative, to the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal literature, to the anti-Japanese revolutionary base areas centered around Yan'an and later the liberated areas' literature, to the great achievements of socialist literature and the arts over the past forty years since the founding of the nation, all have been achieved under the Party's correct leadership. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, under the correct leadership of the second generation of the Party's central leadership with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the core, adhering to the policy of long-term stable development of literature and the arts, our literary and artistic undertakings have undergone historic major changes, with lively thoughts, abundant creations, outstanding talents, and a thriving socialist literary and artistic scene. If we abandon the Party's correct leadership and the guidance of the line and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, as some people advocate, and let bourgeois liberalization leaders or so-called cultural "elites" have their way, our socialist literature and the arts will inevitably go astray and slide into the bourgeois quagmire.

	Strengthening the Party's leadership over literature and the arts is fully consistent with the aspirations of the broad masses of literary and artistic workers to prosper and develop literary and artistic undertakings. In recent years, some people have had a wrong understanding of opposing the Party's leadership to the prosperity of literature and the arts, believing that strengthening the Party's leadership over literature and the arts will hinder the creative freedom of literary and artistic workers. Some people use the pretext of opposing arbitrary interference to shake off the Party's leadership, which is a stance of adhering to bourgeois liberalization and a fallacy that ignores history and reality. Deng Xiaoping pointed out that strengthening the Party's leadership over literature and the arts is to "continuously prosper literary and artistic undertakings, raise the level of literature and the arts, and create outstanding literary and artistic works and performing arts achievements that are worthy of our great people and great era." It can be seen that the Party's purpose of strengthening leadership over literature and the arts is fully consistent with the aspirations of the broad masses of literary and artistic workers to create more and better works and prosper literary and artistic undertakings. This consistency is the foundation for prospering socialist literature and the arts. The Party's leadership over literature and the arts is mainly realized through the formulation and implementation of correct literary and artistic policies. The Party's correct literary and artistic policies are summarized and generalized from literary and artistic practices, in line with the actual development of literature and the arts and the objective laws of literature and the arts, concentrating the wisdom and talents of the broad masses of literary and artistic workers, and are the crystallization of democracy and science. The basic principles of revolutionary literature and the arts proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong in *Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and the Arts* and the later proposed literary and artistic policies of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," "innovating and developing," and "using foreign things for Chinese purposes and using ancient things for modern purposes," as well as other correct literary and artistic policies proposed by our Party in various historical periods, are all the products of combining the basic principles of Marxist literary thought with the practice of the Chinese revolutionary literary and artistic movement, thus playing an important guiding role in the development of our revolutionary literature and the arts and socialist literature and the arts. Since entering a new historical period, our Party has established the direction of serving the people and serving socialism and other literary and artistic policies according to new historical conditions, ensuring the healthy development of socialist literature and the arts and opening up a broad road for the development of socialist literature and the arts. In leading literary and artistic work, our Party also attaches great importance to providing the necessary environment and conditions for the prosperity of literature and the arts; respecting literary and artistic workers and their creative labor, paying attention to listening to their opinions and demands; and focusing on cultivating literary and artistic talents, actively building cultural facilities, and continuously improving the working and learning conditions of literary and artistic workers. The efforts made by our Party in leading socialist literary and artistic undertakings have been proven in practice to be welcomed by the broad masses of literary and artistic workers and are some of the urgent problems that literary and artistic workers need to solve. It can be seen that adhering to and strengthening the Party's leadership over literature and the arts will only bring prosperity and flourishing to literature and the arts, and will not bring about other results.

	The Party's leadership over literature and the arts not only has the issue of strengthening it but also the issue of improving it. Over the past few decades, the Party has accumulated many successful experiences in leading literary and artistic work, but there have also been various lessons. Summarizing the experiences and lessons of these years, learning from Comrade Deng Xiaoping's consistent thoughts on literary and artistic work, to truly strengthen and improve the Party's leadership over literature and the arts, I feel that we must solve the following problems. First, we must overcome and avoid the state of weakness and dispersion, strengthen ideological and political work, and carry out long-term education and struggle to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization to ensure the socialist direction of literature and the arts. Second, we should guide the broad masses of literary and artistic workers to seriously study Marxism, Mao Zedong Thought, especially to study well the philosophy of Marxism, master the scientific worldview and methodology, delve into life, and improve their ideological and artistic cultivation. Third, we should respect the characteristics and development laws of literature and the arts, get rid of bureaucratic style and official will, and abolish administrative orders in specific literary and artistic creation and literary and artistic theoretical criticism work. We should continue to implement the "hundred flowers" policy, fully tap the wisdom and creativity of literary and artistic workers, use equal discussion methods and correct literary and artistic theoretical guidance to help them overcome some biases and misunderstandings. Fourth, according to the principle of the Party managing the Party, we should strengthen the construction of Party organizations in the literary and artistic circles, give full play to the exemplary leading role of Party member literary and artistic workers, unite and lead the broad masses of literary and artistic workers to move forward together, and ensure the implementation of the Party's line, policies, and various correct instructions. Fifth, we should actively formulate and improve economic and cultural policies and regulations that are conducive to the development of literary and artistic undertakings, encourage and support the production and dissemination of excellent spiritual products, and promote the prosperity and development of socialist literary and artistic undertakings.

### 加强和改善党对文艺的领导

    坚持正确方向　繁荣文艺事业
　　加强和改善党对文艺的领导
　　夏赞忠
      《邓小平论文艺》坚持马克思主义、毛泽东文艺思想的基本原理，结合新时期我国社会主义文艺的实践，对加强和改善党对文艺的领导等一系列重要问题，作了精辟的论述。这些论述，是我们党正确领导社会主义文艺事业的经验总结和理论概括，是马克思主义文艺理论的继承和发展，是毛泽东文艺思想新的组成部份。认真学习好《邓小平论文艺》，对于加强和改善党的领导，繁荣社会主义文艺事业，具有极其重要的意义。
    加强党对文艺的领导，是由我国社会主义文艺的性质和任务所决定的。社会主义是中国人民勿庸置疑的历史选择。我们的文艺是社会主义的文艺，如同我们党的其它事业一样，它必须坚持社会主义的方向，坚持马列主义的指导。它的鲜明宗旨就是为人民服务，为社会主义服务。正如邓小平同志所指出的，它担负着满足人民精神生活多方面的需要，培养社会主义新人，提高整个社会的思想、文化、道德水平的重要责任。我国革命文艺和社会主义文艺发展的实践已经证明，只有坚持和加强党的领导，我们的文艺事业才能沿着正确方向健康地繁荣、发展；放松、削弱、离开了党的领导，则不可能出现真正的繁荣发展。从革命战争时期以鲁迅为代表的反帝、反封建的文艺、以延安为中心的抗日革命根据地文艺和后来的解放区文艺，到建国四十年来社会主义文艺所取得的巨大成就，都是在党的正确领导下所取得的。特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，在以邓小平同志为核心的我们党的第二代领导集体的正确领导下，坚持长期稳定地发展文艺的方针和政策，我国的文艺事业发生了历史性的重大变化，思想活跃，创作丰收，人才辈出，社会主义文艺事业呈现出一派欣欣向荣的景象。如果离开了党的正确领导和十一届三中全会以来路线方针的指引，像有些人鼓吹的那样放任自流，让资产阶级自由化头面人物或所谓文化“精英”那一套得了逞，我们的社会主义文艺必然会走向邪路，滑向资产阶级的泥坑。
    加强党对文艺的领导同广大文艺工作者繁荣发展文艺事业的愿望是完全一致的。这些年来，有的人存在一种把党的领导和文艺的繁荣对立起来的错误认识，认为加强党对文艺的领导，会妨碍文艺工作者的创作自由。有的以反对横加干涉为名摆脱党的领导，这是坚持资产阶级自由化的立场，无视历史和现实的谬论。邓小平同志指出，加强党对文艺的领导，是为了“不断繁荣文学艺术事业，提高文学艺术水平，创作出无愧于我们伟大人民，伟大时代的优秀文学艺术作品和表演艺术成果”。可见，我们党加强对文艺的领导的目的与广大文艺工作者创作更多更好的作品，繁荣文艺事业的愿望是完全一致的。这种一致，正是繁荣社会主义文艺的基础。党对文艺的领导，主要是通过制订和实行正确的文艺方针、政策来实现的。我们党正确的文艺方针、政策，是从文艺实践中总结、概括出来的，符合文艺发展的实际和文艺的客观规律，集中了广大文艺工作者的聪明才智，是民主和科学的结晶。毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中提出的革命文艺的一些基本原则和后来提出的“百花齐放”、“推陈出新”、“洋为中用，古为今用”等文艺方针，以及我们党在各个历史时期提出的其他一些正确的文艺方针政策，都是马克思主义文艺思想的基本原理与中国革命文艺运动实践相结合的产物，从而对我国革命文艺和社会主义文艺的发展产生了重要的指导作用。进入新的历史时期以来，我们党又根据新的历史条件，确立了文艺为人民服务，为社会主义服务的方向和其他一系列文艺方针政策，既保证了社会主义文艺的健康发展，又为社会主义文艺的发展开辟了广阔道路。我们党领导文艺工作，还非常重视为繁荣文艺提供必要的环境和条件；尊重文艺工作者及他们的创造性劳动，注意倾听他们的意见和要求；同时注重培养文艺人才，积极建设文化设施，不断改善文艺工作者的工作和学习条件。我们党在领导社会主义文艺事业中所作出的这些努力，实践证明，都是为广大文艺工作者所欢迎的，也是文艺工作者迫切需要解决的一些问题。可见，坚持和加强党对文艺的领导，只会带来文艺的兴盛繁荣，而不会是其他结果。
    党对文艺的领导，不仅有加强的问题，当然也有改善的问题。几十年来，我们党领导文艺工作积累了许多成功的经验，但是，也有这样那样一些教训。总结这些年来的经验教训，学习邓小平同志关于文艺工作的一贯思想，要切实加强和改善党对文艺的领导，我感到必须解决好以下一些问题。一是必须克服和避免软弱涣散状态，大力加强思想政治工作，把坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化的教育和斗争长期地进行下去，以保证文艺的社会主义方向。二是引导广大文艺工作者认真学习马克思主义、毛泽东思想，特别是学好马克思主义的哲学，掌握科学的世界观和方法论，深入生活，提高思想艺术修养。三是要尊重文学艺术的特征和发展规律，去掉衙门作风、长官意志，在具体的文艺创作和文艺理论批评工作中，废止行政命令。要继续贯彻执行文艺的“双百”方针，充分发挥文艺工作者的聪明才智和创造精神，运用平等讨论问题的方式和正确的文艺理论导向，帮助他们克服一些偏差和认识。四是根据党要管党的原则，加强文艺界的党组织建设，充分发挥党员文艺工作者的模范带头作用，团结和带动广大文艺工作者一道前进，保证党的路线、方针、政策和各项正确指示的贯彻执行。五是要积极制订和完善有利于文艺事业发展的经济文化政策和法规，鼓励、扶植优秀的精神产品的生产和传播，促进社会主义文艺事业的繁荣与发展。
