		BEIJING, Oct. 31 (Xinhua) -- The National Bureau of Statistics, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the People's Bank of China jointly released today the key economic indicators for the first nine months of the year for various regions. The data shows that social demand has been initially controlled, fixed asset investments have been further compressed, and the credit situation is better than last year. However, industrial economic benefits have not improved.

		From January to September, the total investment in fixed assets by state-owned enterprises amounted to 112.3 billion yuan, a 9.2 percent decrease compared to the same period last year. Nationwide, the total investment in local projects amounted to 59.6 billion yuan, an 11.6 percent decrease compared to the same period last year. Hubei, Henan, and Zhejiang provinces saw reductions of over 34 percent, but there are still six provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions where the investment in local projects exceeded the same period last year.

		By the end of September, the total outstanding bank loans nationwide were 1,115.25 billion yuan, an increase of 60.1 billion yuan from the beginning of the year. However, this is 39 billion yuan less than the increase in loans from the same period last year.

		In the first nine months, the total wages of workers nationwide were 178.41 billion yuan, an 18.2 percent increase compared to the same period last year, with a slower growth rate. Guangdong Province had the highest increase, at 33.5 percent.

		Labor productivity has remained at a low growth level. Since this year, the growth rate of labor productivity for state-owned industrial enterprises has fluctuated between 0.6 percent and 3.4 percent. From January to September, it was 2.7 percent.

		From January to September, the comparable product costs for state-owned industrial enterprises within the budget increased by 20.1 percent, an increase of 9.5 percentage points compared to the same period last year. Nationwide, except for Inner Mongolia and Guangxi, the cost overruns were all higher than the same period last year.

		The sales tax rate has decreased. From January to September, the cumulative rate was 17.6 percent, a decrease of 2.3 percentage points compared to the same period last year.

		In the first nine months, the capital tax rate for industrial enterprises was 20.1 percent, a decrease of 3.3 percentage points compared to the same period last year. There are 11 regions where the capital tax rate is higher than the national average.

		From January to September, the energy consumption per 10,000 yuan of industrial output value for state-owned industrial enterprises within the budget was 4.84 tons of standard coal, a decrease of 2.6 percent compared to the same period last year.
