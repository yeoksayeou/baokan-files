39 years ago, General Wang Zhen led his troops into Xinjiang and arrived at the foot of the Tian Shan Mountains in this desert. It was on that night, after staying at the carriage inn, that the general made the decision to build a city in Shihezi. From then on, following Chairman Mao's instructions, the troops stationed in Xinjiang were converted to agricultural and defense duties. Subsequently, batch after batch of young people from the interior of the country sang as they marched west, gathering at the border, and on this ancient wilderness, they hacked through the undergrowth, pioneered, and built a beautiful city—Shihezi.

For nearly 40 years, the Party and the government have always paid attention to the construction and development of Shihezi. Revolutionary veterans such as Zhou Enlai, Chen Yi, Deng Xiaoping, and Deng Yingchao have all come here for inspections, giving the broad masses of military farmers who are fighting here warm care and great encouragement.

On November 23 of this year, Li Peng, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council, came to this oasis city in the desert, bringing with him the care and greetings of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to the cadres, workers, and people of all ethnic groups in the reclamation area and the entire Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps.

As soon as he stepped off the plane, Premier Li Peng, without resting, took a car directly to the Shihezi Reclamation Area General Farm to visit the cadres and workers of the regiment.

At the place where Premier Zhou Enlai once talked with the Shanghai youth who came to support the border, Premier Li Peng warmly met with two Shanghai female youth, Zhu Zhaohua and Chen Xueqin, who were received by Premier Zhou 24 years ago. These two Shanghai youths, who came to support the border from the bustling city in 1964, were only about 20 years old when they entered Xinjiang, and now they are both over 40. Over the past 24 years, they have not let down Premier Zhou's expectations and instructions, and together with the broad masses of corps soldiers, they have dedicated their most precious years to the development of the border, growing into the backbone of the reclamation area. Now, one of them is the party branch secretary of the agricultural technical school, and the other is a pharmacist at the clinic.

Premier Li Peng enthusiastically shook hands with them, expressed his cordial greetings, and encouraged them to continue to maintain and carry forward the spirit of hard work and selfless dedication, and to make greater contributions to the defense and construction of the border.

After visiting the Zhou Enlai Memorial Monument, Premier Li Peng also visited the Shihezi General Farm Exhibition Hall. The exhibition, through pictures and artifacts, vividly recreated the history of the corps' broad masses of agricultural reclamation soldiers who carried forward the "Nanliwan" spirit, self-reliance, and hard work. After nearly 40 years of construction, Shihezi has become a new city with agricultural reclamation as its backbone and light textile industry as its mainstay. The Shihezi Reclamation Area has formed a large-scale mechanized agricultural reclamation backbone enterprise with a comprehensive operation of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, industry, commerce, and services. Over the nearly 40 years since its establishment, it has created a pure profit and tax of 47.18 million yuan for the state. Currently, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the reclamation area accounts for 1/3 of the total output value of the entire Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and 1/17 of the entire autonomous region. The total industrial and agricultural output value last year exceeded the 100 million yuan mark for the first time, setting a historical record. The average annual contracted income of reclamation area workers has exceeded 2,000 yuan, nearly double that of 10 years ago.

Premier Li Peng carefully observed the exhibition while asking the reclamation area leaders in detail about the development of various undertakings in the reclamation area. Seeing the achievements made in the construction of the reclamation area, Premier Li Peng's face showed a satisfied smile.

How are the actual living conditions of the reclamation area workers' families? This is a concern for Premier Li Peng. Although it was already evening when leaving the exhibition hall, the sky was dark, and the rain was fine, but Premier Li Peng insisted on visiting the workers' families. He walked on the muddy road and entered the home of Zhang Guangquan, a worker from the 145th Regiment of the Eighth Division of the Corps.

"How is life?" Premier Li Peng asked with concern.

"It's good," Zhang Guangquan replied.

"Do you have a television?"

"Yes, we do."

Premier Li Peng sat side by side with the host on the sofa and chatted warmly, then asked:

"What is your contracting form?"

"We contract as a team, a total of four households," Zhang Guangquan replied.

"Mechanized farming?"

"Yes."

"How much per acre?"

"Over 800 jin."

"How much income this year?"

"About 3,000 yuan."

Premier Li Peng nodded satisfactorily and said, "Your household contracting form not only maintains the advantages of household contracting, which is conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of each household, but also plays the role of collective economy, embodying the advantages of large-scale agriculture with moderate scale. Good, I hope you rely on scientific farming to further increase the yield per acre, and your life will get better and better!"

Leaving Zhang Guangquan's home, Premier Li Peng entered the home of Du Shouli, a transportation specialist.

Du Shouli happily told Premier Li Peng that he spent more than 40,000 yuan to buy a tractor this year.

When he heard that Du Shouli's net income last year was more than 10,000 yuan, Premier Li Peng, pointing to Tiemuerdawaite, the chairman of the Autonomous Region Government who was accompanying the inspection, said humorously, "You earn more than your chairman!" This immediately brought laughter from the crowd.

During the inspection, the broad masses of corps soldiers' spirit of dedication to defending the border and pioneering in Xinjiang left a deep impression on Premier Li Peng.

As the inspection was about to end, Premier Li Peng emotionally told the cadres and workers of the reclamation area: Over the past nearly 40 years, you have defended the border and pioneered here, making tremendous contributions to the defense of the border and the economic development of Xinjiang. The policy of defending the border through agricultural and defense duties is a great innovation. Nearly 40 years of practice have proven that this policy is successful. Comrades have made painstaking efforts for this, and for this, I, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, express my thanks to you all. I hope that you will, on the basis of what has been achieved, take another step forward and build the border even better. The country will not forget you, and the people will not forget you!

　　祖国不会忘记
　　李鹏总理视察新疆石河子垦区纪实
　　新华社记者　何平　汪有富
    39年前，率部进疆的王震将军骑马来到这天山脚下的戈壁荒滩。就是在夜宿车马店的那个夜晚，将军作出了在石河子建设一座城市的决策。从此，根据毛主席的指示，进疆部队就地转业，屯垦戍边。随后，一批又一批内地支边青年高歌西进，云集边陲，在这亘古荒原上披荆斩棘，拓荒创业，建起了一座美丽的城市——石河子。
    近四十年来，党和政府始终关注着石河子的建设与发展。周恩来、陈毅、邓小平、邓颖超等老一辈无产阶级革命家都曾来这里视察，给奋战在这里的广大军垦战士以亲切的关怀和极大的鼓舞。
    今年11月23日，中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理李鹏又带着党中央、国务院对垦区及全体新疆生产建设兵团干部、职工和各族群众的关怀和问候，来到这座戈壁新城。
    一下飞机，李鹏总理顾不上休息就乘车直接前往石河子垦区总场，看望团场广大干部、职工。
    在当年周恩来总理同上海支边青年谈话的地方，李鹏总理亲切会见了24年前受到周总理接见的两位上海女知青朱兆华和陈雪琴。这两位1964年从繁华的大城市来这里支边的上海青年，进疆时还只是20岁左右的年轻姑娘，如今都已逾不惑之年。24年来，她们没有辜负周总理的期望和嘱托，同广大兵团战士一起，为开发边疆奉献了自己最宝贵的年华，成长为垦区的骨干力量。现在，她俩一个担任农业技术学校党支部书记，一个是卫生所的药剂师。
    李鹏总理热情地同她们握手，向她们表示亲切慰问，并勉励她们继续保持、发扬艰苦创业的忘我奉献精神，为保卫边疆、建设边疆作出更大贡献。
    在瞻仰了周总理纪念碑后，李鹏总理又参观了石河子总场展览馆。展览通过图片和实物，形象地再现了兵团广大农垦战士发扬“南泥湾”精神，自力更生，艰苦奋斗的创业史。经过近40年的建设，石河子已经建成了一座以农垦事业为依托，以轻纺工业为主的新兴城市。石河子垦区已形成了一个以农业为主，农林牧副渔、工交建商服综合经营的机械化大型农垦骨干企业。建场近40年来，共为国家创纯利税4718万元。目前，垦区的工农业生产总值已占整个新疆生产建设兵团总产值的1／3，占全自治区的1／17。去年的工农业总产值首次突破了亿元大关，创历史纪录。垦区职工年平均承包收入突破2000元，比10年前提高了近两倍。
    李鹏总理一边仔细地观看展览，一边向垦区领导详细了解垦区的各项事业的发展情况。看到垦区建设取得的这些成就，李鹏总理脸上浮出了欣慰和满意的笑容。
    垦区职工的家庭实际生活情况怎么样？这是李鹏总理所牵挂的问题。尽管离开展览馆已是傍晚，暮色苍茫，细雨蒙蒙，但李鹏总理仍执意要走访职工家庭。他踏着泥泞的土路，走进了兵团农八师145团职工张广泉家。
    “日子过得怎么样？”李鹏总理关切地问。
    “挺好的。”张广泉回答。
    “有电视机吗？”
    “有了。”
    李鹏总理和主人并肩坐在长沙发上亲切地拉家常，然后又问道：
    “你们是怎么个承包形式？”
    “以班组为单位，一共四户。”张广泉回答。
    “机械化耕作？”
    “是的。”
    “亩产能打多少？”
    “单产800多斤。”
    “今年能收入多少？”
    “3000来块吧。”
    李鹏总理满意地点着头说：“你们这种联户的形式，既保持了家庭联产承包的优越性，有利于调动一家一户的积极性，同时又发挥了集体经济的作用，体现了适度规模经营的大农业的优势。好，希望你们依靠科学种田，进一步提高单产，日子过得越来越好！”
    离开张广泉家，李鹏总理又走进运输专业户杜守礼家。
    杜守礼高兴地告诉李鹏总理，他今年花了4万多元买了一台拖拉机。
    当听说杜守礼去年的净收入达1万多元时，李鹏总理指着陪同视察的自治区政府主席铁木尔·达瓦买提风趣地说：“你挣的比你们主席还多嘛！”一时引来满堂笑声。
    视察中，广大兵团战士在新疆屯垦戍边、艰苦创业的奉献精神，给李鹏总理留下了深刻的印象。
    在视察即将结束之际，李鹏总理深情地对垦区干部、职工说：近40年来，你们在这里屯垦戍边，为保卫边疆和发展新疆的经济建设作出了巨大贡献。屯垦戍边是个创举。近40年的实践证明，这个政策是成功的，同志们为此付出了辛勤的劳动，对此，我代表党中央、国务院向大家表示感谢。希望你们在现有的基础上，再上一个新台阶，把边疆建设得更好。国家不会忘记你们，人民也不会忘记你们！
