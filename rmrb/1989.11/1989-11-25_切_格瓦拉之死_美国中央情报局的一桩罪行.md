Former CIA agent Felix Rodriguez recently revealed that he personally ordered the execution of Ernesto "Che" Guevara, the former Cuban leader who had participated in guerrilla warfare in Bolivia, contrary to the Bolivian government's previous claim that "Guevara died in combat."

Rodriguez served as an advisor to the Bolivian army's counter-guerrilla operations in the mid-1960s and was involved in numerous covert operations, including the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and aiding Nicaraguan anti-government forces. He was a seasoned CIA agent.

On October 19 of this year, he spoke to the press in Miami about his book "Shadow Warrior," which details the final moments of Che Guevara's life. The book also includes the only known photograph of Guevara taken a few hours before his execution on October 9, 1967. This photograph had been kept in the CIA's archives. In the photo, Rodriguez, who was then using the alias "Max Ramos" and held the rank of Bolivian Army captain, is seen with Che.

Che Guevara went into hiding in Africa and several Latin American countries in 1965 to engage in guerrilla warfare.

In the summer of 1966, Guevara established and led a guerrilla unit in the Santa Cruz region of Bolivia. On October 8, 1967, this unit was surrounded and almost entirely annihilated by the Bolivian government forces.

There had long been reports that Guevara was captured while injured and subsequently killed, but the Bolivian government had propagated the story that he died in combat.

Rodriguez emphasized that the materials in his book are "absolutely true."

According to him, Guevara was lightly injured when captured. He was flown to the village of La Higuera by Bolivian Army Colonel Joaquin Zenteno and Rodriguez in a helicopter at 7:30 AM on October 9, and they returned with Guevara's body to the Granada Valley at 2 PM, where the Bolivian military displayed Guevara's body to the press.

Rodriguez said that although the CIA was very interested in Guevara's capture, he had to follow the orders of the Bolivian military authorities and ordered Guevara's execution a few hours after talking to him.

According to Rodriguez, he ordered Bolivian Army Sergeant Mario Teran, "Prepare to shoot him (Guevara), but make sure not to shoot him in the face, so people will think he died in combat."

At 1:10 PM, Guevara was executed. Rodriguez did not witness the execution but heard the sound of an M-2 automatic rifle. Guevara thus died under the guns of the CIA and the Bolivian military.

Rodriguez also revealed that before the execution, he told Guevara that despite efforts to save him, his death was inevitable. Guevara replied, "It's better this way, because I should not die in captivity."

This former CIA agent admitted that he had changed from hating Guevara to admiring him, because Guevara had bravely and honorably sacrificed himself for his beliefs.

　　“切”·格瓦拉之死
　　——美国中央情报局的一桩罪行
　　颜庆华
    前中央情报局特工人员费利克斯·罗德里格斯最近透露，是他亲自下令处决了曾在玻利维亚参加过游击战的前古巴领导人埃内斯托·“切”·格瓦拉，而决非玻利维亚官方以前声称的“格瓦拉是在战斗中阵亡的”。
    罗德里格斯在60年代中期担任过玻利维亚军队反游击战的顾问，也参与过入侵古巴吉隆滩和协助尼加拉瓜反政府武装等不少阴谋颠覆活动，曾是一位老资格的中央情报局特工人员。
    今年10月19日，他在美国迈阿密就其写的《阴影中的战士》一书发行向报界发表讲话指出，这本书中有一章详细描述了“切”·格瓦拉生命中最后时刻的情景。
    这本书还刊登了目前留存在世的唯一一张格瓦拉在1967年10月9日被处决前数小时的照片。
    在这之前，此照一直保存在中央情报局的档案柜中。照片中同“切”在一起的就是曾任玻利维亚军队顾问的罗德里格斯，当时他化名为“马克斯·拉莫斯”，军衔为玻利维亚陆军上尉。
    “切”·格瓦拉在1965年隐姓埋名地去非洲和拉美一些国家从事游击战。
    1966年夏，格瓦拉在玻利维亚圣克鲁斯地区建立和领导一支游击队，1967年10月8日，这支游击队被玻利维亚政府军包围，几乎全部被歼。
    一直有消息认为，格瓦拉因伤被俘，随即遇害，但玻官方却宣传格瓦拉死于战斗中。
    罗德里格斯强调指出，他写的这本书中的材料是
  “绝对真实的”。
    据他说，格瓦拉在被捕时身受轻伤，他是在10月9日上午7点30分同玻利维亚陆军上校华金·森特诺乘直升飞机来到伊格拉村，直到下午2点才携带着格瓦拉的尸体前往格兰达谷地，在那里玻利维亚军队向报界展示了格瓦拉的尸体。
    罗德里格斯说，虽然中央情报局对格瓦拉被活捉一事非常感兴趣，但他在同格瓦拉谈话几个小时之后，还是不得不按照玻利维亚最高军事当局的意图，下令处决了格瓦拉。
    据他说，他当时下令玻利维亚陆军军士长特兰：“准备向他（格瓦拉）射击，但要注意不要朝脸部开枪，这样人们会认为他是在战斗中受伤身亡的。”
    下午1点10分处决格瓦拉时，罗德里格斯不愿亲临现场，但亲耳听到了一阵“M—2”自动步枪的射击声，格瓦拉就这样死在中央情报局和玻利维亚军队的枪口之下。
    罗德里格斯还透露，在处决前，他曾对格瓦拉说，尽管作了努力，但他（格瓦拉）的死已不可避免。
    对此，格瓦拉回答说，
  “最好是这样，因为我决不应该死于囚禁。”这位前中央情报局特工人员承认，现在，他已经由对格瓦拉的怨恨变成了对他的钦佩，因为格瓦拉是为其信念，勇敢而又尊严地献身的。
