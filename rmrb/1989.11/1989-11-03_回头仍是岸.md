The Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate issued the "Notice on the Requirement for Criminals of Embezzlement, Bribery, and Speculation to Surrender and Confess Within a Specified Period" (hereinafter referred to as the "Notice"). By October 31, the specified period in the "Notice" has expired. During this period, a large number of economic criminals have surrendered and confessed, actively returned stolen property, and reported crimes, and they have obtained or will obtain lenient treatment from the judicial authorities in accordance with the law. Those economic criminals who remain obstinate and refuse to surrender will inevitably face severe punishment by the law. The Party's policy of "leniency for those who confess and severity for those who resist" has once again demonstrated its immense power.

After the "Notice," the resolute struggle against serious economic crimes and the fight against corruption will continue. The struggle against economic crimes and corruption is not only a severe battle in the economic field but also a political struggle that relates to the life and death of the Party and the state. It is an established policy of our Party and state to persistently and unremittingly carry out the struggle against serious economic crimes in a deep and sustained manner.

Therefore, those economic criminals who are still stubbornly resisting should not naively believe that the "Notice" is just a passing breeze and that they will be safe after avoiding it. No matter how cleverly they disguise themselves or how secretly they operate, once they have committed a crime, they will leave traces and will be subject to legal punishment. Moreover, since the issuance of the "Notice," public reports have increased several times, and many criminals have been recorded and filed by the judicial authorities. The judicial authorities will take responsibility and investigate each case thoroughly based on public reports. Those economic criminals, even if they avoid the first day, how can they avoid the fifteenth? Those who stubbornly try to pass through by force are only deceiving themselves. In the end, "cleverness leads to one's own downfall," how sad it is!

The "Notice" is an opportunity given by the Party and the state to economic criminals to repent and reform under specific historical conditions. Now, those economic criminals who have missed this opportunity should not make the same mistake again. Although the leniency after the "Notice" will not be as great as that stipulated in the "Notice," turning back is still the shore. Surrendering and confessing to obtain leniency is still a path to save oneself and seek a new life.

"Leniency for those who confess and severity for those who resist" is a consistent policy of our Party over the years. This policy will be implemented in the specific execution of the law at any time and under any circumstances. After the expiration of the "Notice" period, it will also be the same in judicial practice. From a legal perspective, Article 63 of the Criminal Law of our country stipulates that surrender is a statutory mitigating circumstance and clearly provides for the possibility of reduced or exempted punishment. The judicial authorities will certainly strictly implement this policy of the Party and strictly act in accordance with these legal provisions.

Once a person has committed a crime, the crime committed is irrevocable, but the path to take after committing the crime can be chosen by oneself. Only by making a firm decision to surrender and confess and seeking lenient treatment can one make the correct choice.

    回头仍是岸

    最高人民法院、最高人民检察院发布的《关于贪污、受贿、投机倒把等犯罪分子必须在限期内自首坦白的通告》（以下简称“通告”）至10月31日已到限期。在“通告”限期中，一大批经济犯罪分子自首坦白，积极退赃，检举立功，他们已得到或将要得到司法机关的依法从宽处理；而那些执迷不悟、拒不自首的经济犯罪分子，必将受到法律的严厉惩处。党的“坦白从宽，抗拒从严”的政策再一次显示了它的强大威力。
    “通告”过后，坚决打击严重经济犯罪活动，惩治腐败的斗争仍要继续进行。与经济犯罪和腐败现象作斗争，不仅是经济领域中一场严峻的斗争，而且是一场关系到党和国家生死存亡的政治斗争。坚定不移地、坚持不懈地把严惩严重经济犯罪的斗争深入、持久地进行下去，这是我们党和国家的既定政策。
    因此，那些至今仍负隅顽抗的经济犯罪分子，切不可天真地以为“通告”只是一阵风，躲过之后便平安无事了。无论伪装得多么巧妙，手段多么隐蔽，只要犯了罪，就要留下痕迹，就要受到法律的制裁。何况，“通告”发布以来，群众举报成倍增长，许多犯罪分子已在司法机关挂了号、备了案。司法机关将根据群众举报负责地逐一查个水落石出。那些经济犯罪分子，即便躲过了初一，又岂能躲过十五。一味地硬着头皮，企图蒙混过关，只是自欺欺人。到头来，“聪明反被聪明误”，岂不悲哉！
    “通告”是党和国家在特定历史条件下给予经济犯罪分子的一个悔罪自新的机会。如今，已经丧失这一机会的经济犯罪分子不可一错再错了，尽管“通告”以后从宽的幅度不会像“通告”规定得那样大了，但是，回头仍是岸。投案自首，坦白从宽，仍是一条自己挽救自己的新生之路。
    “坦白从宽，抗拒从严”，是我们党多年来的一贯政策，这一政策在任何时候、任何情况下，都将贯穿于法律的具体执行中。“通告”限期过后，在司法实践中，亦是如此。从法律上看，我国刑法第六十三条，把自首作为法定的从宽情节，作了可以减轻或者免除处罚的明确规定。司法机关当然要严格执行党的这一政策，严格依照法律的这些规定办事。
    一个犯了罪的人已经犯下的罪行是无法挽回的，但犯罪以后走哪条路，却是可以自己选择的。只有痛下决心，自首坦白，争取从宽处理，才是唯一正确的选择。
