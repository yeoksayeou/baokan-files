This People's Daily correspondent reports from the United Nations, November 16th: The 44th session of the United Nations General Assembly today passed a resolution on the "situation in Cambodia," emphasizing that Vietnam's unilateral announcement of a complete withdrawal from Cambodia is invalid. The resolution demands that Vietnam withdraw its troops from Cambodia under UN supervision, marking the first step towards a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian problem.

The draft resolution, jointly proposed by Thailand and 79 other countries, received 124 votes in favor, 17 votes against (including Vietnam), and 12 abstentions. The number of votes in favor increased by 2 compared to the previous session, while the number of votes against decreased by 2.

On September 26th, Vietnam unilaterally announced its complete withdrawal from Cambodia. However, the resolution points out that Vietnam's claimed withdrawal has not been supervised or verified by the United Nations. The resolution states that the main components of a fair and lasting solution to the Cambodian problem must include "the withdrawal of all foreign troops under UN control, the establishment of a temporary administrative authority, and the promotion of national reconciliation under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk among all Cambodian people."

The resolution finally urges "all parties concerned to redouble their efforts to resolve the Cambodian problem through a comprehensive political solution, to prevent further hostilities and the continued suffering of the Cambodian people, and to ensure Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, neutrality, and non-aligned status, as well as to prevent the resumption of the recently condemned policies and practices."

The debate on the Cambodian issue at this session of the UN General Assembly lasted for two days, with 59 countries' representatives speaking.

    本届联大通过决议
    要求越南在联合国监督下撤军
    本报联合国11月16日电  记者刘开宸报道：第44届联合国大会今天通过关于“柬埔寨局势”的决议，强调越南自己宣布的已从柬埔寨全部撤军无效，要求越南在联合国监督下从柬埔寨撤军，实现全面政治解决柬埔寨问题的第一步。
    泰国等79国共同提出的这项决议草案，在表决时，124票赞成，越南等17票反对，12票弃权。赞成票比上届联大多2票，反对票少2票。
    今年9月26日，越南单方面宣布从柬全部撤军。但是联大决议指出，越南所宣称的撤军并没有得到联合国的监督与核查。决议指出，柬埔寨问题公正持久解决办法的主要组成部分，必须包括“在联合国的控制下撤出一切外国军队，建立临时行政当局，促进在西哈努克亲王领导下的全体柬埔寨人的民族和解”。
    决议最后呼吁“有关各方加紧努力，使柬埔寨问题通过全面政治解决办法得到解决，以防止进一步的敌对和柬埔寨人民的继续苦难，从而确保柬埔寨的独立、主权、领土完整、中立和不结盟地位，以及不会恢复不久以前实行的遭到普遍谴责的政策和做法”。
    本届联大关于柬埔寨问题的辩论历时2天，有59个国家的代表发了言。
