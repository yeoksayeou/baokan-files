Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd, the People's Daily published a joint statement from 18 domestic automobile manufacturing enterprises regarding the production of counterfeit products by some factories in Qinghe County. This has drawn the attention of the Qinghe County Committee and the county government. They immediately strengthened their efforts and conducted a comprehensive cleanup and rectification of the automobile parts industry, punishing 110 illegal operators.

Since 1984, Qinghe County's automobile parts processing industry has developed rapidly. Currently, there are over 3,800 production and sales outlets, producing more than 100 types of automobile rubber parts and other components, which are sold nationwide. Most production and sales operators maintain good credit, emphasize quality, and operate legally, earning praise from a wide range of users. However, there are indeed a few who seek only profit, using various means to impersonate well-known manufacturers and sell substandard products.

To eliminate illegal business practices, Qinghe County established a leading group for the rectification of the automobile parts industry, with the county's main leaders serving as the group's leaders. The group includes personnel from the Public Security Bureau, the Industrial and Commercial Bureau, the Township and Village Enterprises Bureau, and other units, as well as a group of backbone forces forming the office. The office is responsible for conducting a "four-cleanup" of all automobile parts processing and sales outlets in the county: First, cleaning up enterprise names, revoking more than 30 automobile parts supply offices, allocation offices, equipment offices, and service offices with names that do not match reality, and canceling the business licenses of 21 illegal operators; second, cleaning up enterprise seals, confiscating and destroying 36 private seals with impersonation and infringement characteristics, and punishing the holders; third, cleaning up bank accounts, solving the problem of multiple accounts for more than 40 enterprises, and blocking the channels for illegal operators to hold goods without payment; fourth, cleaning up registered operations, closing more than 30 registered units.

Qinghe County also formulated the "Regulations on Strengthening the Management of Automobile Parts Production and Operation," and established quality inspection organizations at both the county and township levels. Enterprises and outlets are equipped with full-time quality inspectors, ensuring that products from production outlets that do not meet quality standards are not allowed to leave the factory; counterfeit products are not allowed to leave the county.

    别人揭“疮疤”  自己整“家丑”
    清河整顿汽车配件行业
    110名违法经营者受到惩处
    本报讯　10月22日，本报刊登国内18家汽车生产企业关于清河县有些厂家生产假冒产品的《联合声明》后，引起了河北省清河县委、县政府的重视。他们随即加强力量，对汽车配件行业进行了全面清理整顿，并惩处了110名违法经营者。
    1984年以来，清河县汽车配件加工业迅速发展，目前已有生产经销摊点3800多个，生产上百种型号的汽车橡胶件和其它零部件，销往全国各地。多数生产经销者讲信誉、重质量，依法经营，受到了广大用户的赞誉。但也确有少数人唯利是图，采取多种手段，冒用出名厂家之名，兜售残次产品。
    为杜绝违法经营行为的发生，清河县专门成立了整顿汽车配件行业领导小组，由县委县政府主要领导同志任正副组长，抽调公安局、工商局、乡镇企业局等单位的负责人和一批骨干力量组成办公室，负责对全县所有汽车配件加工经销摊点进行“四清理”：一是清理企业名称，撤销了名不符实的各种汽车配件供应处、调拨处、配备处、服务处30多个，吊销了21家违法经营者的营业执照；二是清理企业公章，收缴销毁36枚带有冒名侵权性质的私刻公章，并对持有者进行了处罚；三是清理银行帐号，解决了40多家企业多头立户的问题，堵塞了违法经营者空托货款的渠道；四是清理挂户经营，关闭了30多个挂户单位。
    清河县还制订了“关于加强汽车配件生产经营管理条例”，同时，县、乡均设立了质量检查组织，企业摊点配备了专职质检员，做到了生产摊点的产品不合格的一律不得出厂；假冒产品一律不得出境。
