The State Council's issuance of the "Decision on Vigorous Promotion of Agricultural Water Conservancy Basic Construction" has injected new vitality into the agricultural water conservancy basic construction projects that have been underway since the autumn. Currently, a wave of mass agricultural water conservancy basic construction is sweeping across the country.

In the vast northern plains, agricultural water conservancy basic construction started early, on a large scale, and in successive waves. The three northeastern provinces, which have long suffered from drought, are preparing to concentrate financial, human, and material resources to focus on drought resistance, reversing the trend of recent years where agricultural fields have been vulnerable to natural disasters. Since 1987, Liaoning Province's "Yu Cup" competition for agricultural water conservancy has effectively motivated the entire province to increase investment in water conservancy, enhancing its social benefits. This year, Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces have also launched the "Black Dragon Cup" and "Heavenly Lake Cup" competitions for agricultural water conservancy basic construction. Since October, Liaoning Province has seen its highest daily labor force exceed 2 million, completing 61 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, and building 60,000 acres of new agricultural terraces.

The Shandong Provincial Government has proposed that agricultural water conservancy basic construction should rely on local efforts rather than national support. Starting this year, each rural labor force should contribute 30-50 days of mandatory labor accumulation annually. Yantai City has identified 16 channels for fund-raising.

In the south, the momentum for water conservancy construction is growing. Following the national water conservancy construction conference in southern rural areas and the State Council's national agricultural water conservancy basic construction telephone conference, local governments have swiftly taken action to deploy agricultural water conservancy basic construction.

Hunan Province's agricultural water conservancy basic construction this year started a month earlier than previous years. By mid-October, the province had initiated 126,500 water conservancy projects, excavated over 68 million cubic meters of earth and stone, and contributed 77 million labor days. Compared to the same period last year, these figures have increased by 25%, 61%, and 54% respectively. Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which has been severely affected by autumn droughts, has centered its efforts on drought resistance and disaster relief, mobilizing all party, government, military, and civilian forces to embark on this winter and next spring's agricultural water conservancy basic construction with a spirit of hard work and perseverance.

Currently, the "advance guard" water conservancy battles in various southern provinces have basically concluded. After the late autumn crops are harvested, a large number of laborers will shift to water conservancy construction, and a large-scale agricultural water conservancy offensive will be launched across the country.

    贯彻国务院《决定》见行动
    各地着手秋冬农田水利基建
    本报讯　国务院发布的《关于大力开展农田水利基本建设的决定》，为入秋以来陆续展开的农田水利基本建设注入了新的活力。目前，一个群众大搞农田水利基本建设的热潮正在全国各地兴起。
    在广袤的北方大地上，农田水利基本建设动手早，规模大，高潮迭起。饱受干旱之苦的东北三省，准备集中财力、人力、物力，以抓抗旱为中心，扭转近年来农田抗御自然灾害能力脆弱的局面。始于1987年的辽宁省农田水利“大禹杯”竞赛活动，卓有成效地激励全省对水利增加投入，提高了水利的社会效益。今年黑龙江、吉林两省也分别开展了“黑龙杯”和“天池杯”的农田水利基本建设竞赛活动。进入10月份以来，辽宁省最高日出工超过200万个，完成土石方6100万立方米，新修农业水平梯田6万亩。
    山东省政府提出，开展农田水利基本建设，不靠国家靠自己，从今年起，每个农村劳动力年义务积累工要达到30—50个。烟台市明确了16项资金的筹集渠道。
    在南方，兴修水利的声势日渐高涨。继全国南方农村水利建设现场会以及国务院全国农田水利基本建设电话会议之后，各地政府迅速行动，部署开展农田水利基本建设。
    湖南省今年的农田水利基本建设比往年提早一个月。到10月中旬，全省已铺开各类水利工程12.65万处，开挖土石方6800多万立方米，投入劳动积累工7700多万个。与去年同期相比，分别增长了25％、61％和54％。秋旱严重的广西壮族自治区，以抗旱救灾为中心，发动全体党政军民，以艰苦奋斗的精神投入今冬明春的农田水利基本建设。
    目前，南方各省的水利“前哨战”已基本结束，晚秋作物收获后的大批劳力正转入兴修水利的战场，大规模的农田水利攻坚战将在各地全面展开。
