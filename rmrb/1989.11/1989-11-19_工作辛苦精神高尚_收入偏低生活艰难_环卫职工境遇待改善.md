According to the Ministry of Construction's Personnel Department, there are currently nearly 260,000 sanitation workers in China, along with 120,000 privately employed cleaners. They are responsible for cleaning over 600 million square meters of roads in urban areas nationwide. In 1988, they collectively disposed of 57.51 million tons of domestic waste and 23.52 million tons of sewage. It is their hard work that has made our cities beautiful and clean. However, the wages and benefits of sanitation workers do not match their contributions.

Currently, the mechanization level of sanitation work in China is low, relying mainly on manual sweeping and shoulder-carrying. On average, one cleaner is responsible for 5,500 square meters of road, sweeping it twice a day. Garbage handlers, on average, transport five tons of garbage per person per day. During the summer when fruits and vegetables are in season, the amount of garbage increases by 50%. Sewage cleaners have to clean over one ton of sewage per day, walking about 12.5 kilometers with a load of 40 kilograms (sewage bucket). They are constantly exposed to sewage and garbage, which poses significant health risks. Beijing City conducted a test, finding that the amount of bacteria, dust concentration, and malodorous substances inhaled by sanitation workers during work exceeded national standards.

According to a survey of 35 cities, before the wage reform, the average wage of sanitation workers was 20% lower than that of local workers. After the wage reform, according to a survey of nine cities including Taiyuan, the average monthly wage of sanitation workers in 1988 was 125 yuan, still 15.4% lower than that of local workers. Bonuses and position allowances are also relatively low, with bonuses averaging 15 to 20 yuan per month and position allowances ranging from 6 to 8 jiao per day. According to a survey of 24 cities, the average monthly retirement pension for sanitation workers in 1988 was 60.48 yuan, with 45% earning less than 50 yuan, making their lives very difficult. Labor protection standards and medical fee standards are mostly based on regulations from over a decade ago. Therefore, their disease and mortality rates are higher than those of the general population. Additionally, due to societal biases, sanitation workers have a low social status and are often discriminated against by society. Young workers have difficulty finding partners, with men over the age of 30 being more than twice as likely to be unmarried compared to other professions. The problem of "difficulty in recruiting and retaining workers" is a significant issue for sanitation departments.

### 工作辛苦精神高尚　收入偏低生活艰难  环卫职工境遇待改善

    工作辛苦精神高尚　收入偏低生活艰难
    环卫职工境遇待改善
    据建设部人事司提供的资料，目前我国有近26万环卫职工，另有民办保洁工12万人，他们担负着全国城镇六亿多平方米的道路清扫任务。1988年，共清运生活垃圾5751万吨，清运粪便2352万吨。正是他们的辛勤劳作，换来了座座城市的美丽和洁净。然而，环卫职工的工资福利与贡献很不相符。
    目前我国环卫工作机械化程度低，主要靠手扫肩挑，平均一名清洁工承担5500平方米的路面，一日扫两遍。垃圾装卸工平均每天每人装运五吨垃圾，夏季瓜果上市，垃圾量增加50％。淘粪工每天要清淘粪便一吨以上，每天要负重40公斤（粪桶）行走12.5公里左右。他们常年与粪便垃圾打交道，身体受到的危害较大。北京市曾作过测试，环卫工人作业时从空气中吸入的细菌量、尘浓变和恶臭物质浓变都超过国家规定标准。
    据对35个城市调查，在工资改革前，环卫职工平均工资水平比当地职工低20％。工资改革后，据对太原等九个市的调查，去年环卫职工月均工资125元，仍比当地职工低15.4％左右。奖金和岗位津贴也较低，奖金月均15至20元，岗位津贴一天6至8角。据对24个城市调查，1988年环卫职工退休工资月均60.48元，其中不足50元者占45％，生活十分艰难。劳动保护标准和医药费标准大多是执行十几年前的规定。因而，他们的患病率和死亡率比一般人要高。此外，由于世俗偏见，环卫职工社会地位低下，他们被社会歧视的现象十分严重，青年工人找对象难，男大龄未婚者比其它行业多两倍以上。招工“招不进，留不住”成为环卫部门的一大问题。
