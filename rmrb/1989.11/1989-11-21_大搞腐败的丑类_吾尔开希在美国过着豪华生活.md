One of the reactionary leaders who instigated turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots, Wuerkaixi, on the one hand, led the so-called "hunger strike," while on the other hand, he led his henchmen to dine in restaurants. This scene was broadcast on television multiple times and is well-known to everyone. This traitor fled to the United States and became an exile politician. How is his life now? According to a Chinese-language newspaper published in New York, the *World Journal*, he is living a luxurious life in his new home in Boston. He is a "visiting student" at Harvard University, but "very few people have seen him attending classes." Instead, "they have a deep impression of his designer suits and his extravagant spending." When he goes out to spread reactionary propaganda, "he only stays in four-star hotels, with room rates ranging from $80 to $250 per night." He has already set up an office and hired a full-time secretary, with the office rent costing $1,100 per month.

How does Wuerkaixi afford such a luxurious lifestyle? According to the newspaper, "all expenses are paid with donations from overseas Chinese." Wuerkaixi admits to receiving over $10,000 in donations, but one of his friends says the actual amount is much higher. In addition, he can earn some "speaking fees" while spreading reactionary propaganda. Of course, people have not forgotten that Wuerkaixi fled with a large sum of money embezzled during his leadership of the riots. Otherwise, a few hundred thousand dollars would not be enough for him to squander.

Wuerkaixi and his ilk, who instigated turmoil and riots, raised a significant banner of "opposing corruption." However, as soon as he went into exile overseas, he could only survive on the alms of anti-socialist and anti-People's Republic of China reactionary forces. Under these circumstances, he lives such a luxurious life, proving that this "elite" who claims to "oppose corruption" is actually a corrupt scoundrel. From this, one can imagine that if these scoundrels' counter-revolutionary plots succeed and they come to power, they will corrupt to an even greater extent and cause immense harm to our country and people. Just from this point, one can see the great significance of suppressing this counter-revolutionary riot.

Throughout history, there have been countless examples of people who deceived the masses with high-sounding slogans, only to betray their promises once in power and act recklessly. Wuerkaixi and his ilk have merely added new material to this history of villainy. Precisely because of this, "listen to their words, observe their actions" has become an eternal adage. Good people, when you hear someone speaking sweeter than honey, you must be vigilant, pay attention to their actions, and never believe them lightly.

Incidentally, according to the *Hong Kong Tiger Report*, the *World Journal* in New York is supported by Taiwan. Everyone knows that Taiwan has meddled in the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing. Recently, there was news that the reactionary organizations established by Wuerkaixi and his ilk overseas are preparing to send a delegation to visit Taiwan, showing how closely they are connected. It's not surprising, then, that such a newspaper would expose this group of people. In fact, it's not surprising, as the so-called "donations" given to this group are used to carry out evil schemes against the Communist Party and to subvert the socialist system, while this group squanders the money, naturally causing their discontent.

### 大搞腐败的丑类——吾尔开希在美国过着豪华生活

　　大搞腐败的丑类
　　——吾尔开希在美国过着豪华生活
　　钟严
    制造动乱和反革命暴乱的反动头目之一的吾尔开希，一面带头进行所谓“绝食”，一面却带领他的喽罗进餐馆吃喝。这个镜头在电视上放过多次，是大家都已熟知了的。这个叛徒逃到美国当了流亡政客。现在他生活的情况又怎样呢？据在纽约出版的一家华文报纸《世界日报》揭露，他在波士顿的新家过着豪华的生活。他是哈佛大学一位“访问学生”，但“只有极少的人看见他前去听课”，“相反，他们对他的名牌西装和大手大脚花钱却有很深的印象”。他外出进行反动宣传，“只住四星级饭店，房费每晚80美元到250美元之间”，“他已设置了一处办公室，雇了一名专职秘书，办公室的月租金为1100美元”。
    吾尔开希靠什么过着如此豪华的生活？据这家报纸说：“一切款项都用海外华人的捐款支付”，“吾尔开希承认收到了1万多美元的捐款，但他的一位朋友说，实际数字要大得多”。此外，他在进行反动宣传时还可以捞到一点
  “讲演”费。当然，人们没有忘记，吾尔开希是携带着在领导暴乱中所贪污的一笔巨款潜逃的。不然，万把几万美元是不够他如此挥霍的。
    吾尔开希之流制造动乱和暴乱打出的一面重要旗帜是“反对腐败”。但是，他刚刚流亡到海外，只是靠着那些反对社会主义、反对中华人民共和国的反动势力的施舍才得以苟延残喘。就在这种情况下，他竟过着如此豪华的生活，可见这个“反对腐败”的“精英”恰恰是大搞腐败的丑类。由此人们可以想见，如果让这帮丑类的反革命阴谋得了逞，让他们得了势上了台，还不知要腐败到什么样子，要使我们的国家和人民遭受多么大的危害。仅仅从这一点，也可以看出粉碎这场反革命暴乱有着多么重大的意义。
    历史上，以高喊漂亮的口号欺骗群众，一旦上台就背叛自己的诺言，不顾一切地倒行逆施，这样的例子是太多太多了。吾尔开希之流的作为，不过在这部丑恶史上增添了一点新的材料。正是因为如此，所以“听其言，观其行”，就成了千古不朽的名训。善良的人们，当你听到有人把好话说得比蜜还甜的时候，一定要提起警觉，注意考察他的行动，切切不可轻信。
    顺便说一句，据《香港虎报》报道，纽约《世界日报》是受台湾支持的。谁都清楚，北京的动乱和反革命暴乱台湾是插了手的。前不久又有消息说，吾尔开希之流在海外成立的反动组织准备派代表团去台湾“访问”，可见他们同台湾是勾得很紧的。你说巧也不巧，正是这样一家报纸出来揭露了这一伙人。其实，并不奇怪，他们给这伙人的所谓“捐款”，是让这伙人拿了去从事反对共产党、颠覆社会主义制度的罪恶勾当的，而这伙人却大肆挥霍，自然就要引起他们的不满了。
