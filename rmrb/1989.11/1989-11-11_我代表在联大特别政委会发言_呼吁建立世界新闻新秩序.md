China's representative, Yuan Shibing, today at the 44th session of the UN General Assembly Special Political Committee meeting, called for the establishment of a new world information and communication order. He urged the gradual strengthening of the news and communication infrastructure in developing countries to facilitate the better two-way flow of information on the basis of respecting national sovereignty and equality.

Yuan Shibing emphasized in his speech that the current flow of information between developed and developing countries is highly imbalanced. Developed countries basically monopolize the production and dissemination of global news and information, while most developing countries, to varying degrees, can only be consumers of these news and information products.

Yuan Shibing criticized certain media outlets in Western countries for often using their own value systems as the basis for reporting on developing countries. Many of these reports are biased and unfair, and some even resort to fabrications or distortions, damaging mutual understanding and friendship among peoples of different countries and hindering international peace and cooperation.

The Special Political Committee began discussing news-related issues on November 6. Many representatives from developing countries advocate for the establishment of a new world information and communication order to address issues of news freedom, balance, and two-way flow. However, some representatives from Western countries, using the pretext of news freedom, have raised objections to this.

    我代表在联大特别政委会发言
    呼吁建立世界新闻新秩序
    本报联合国11月9日电  记者刘开宸报道：中国代表袁士槟今天在第44届联大特别政治委员会会议上呼吁建立世界新闻和传播新秩序，逐步加强发展中国家的新闻和传播的基础结构，以便在尊重国家主权和平等的基础上使信息能更好地双向流通。
    袁士槟在发言中强调，目前发达国家与发展中国家之间的信息流通很不均衡，发达国家基本上垄断了世界新闻和信息制作与传播的活动，而大部分发展中国家在不同程度上只能成为这些新闻和信息产品的消费者。
    袁士槟批评西方国家中某些传播媒介在报道发展中国家的情况时往往以他们的价值观念作为依据，许多报道不客观、不公正，有的甚至采取了造谣或歪曲的手段，损害了各国人民之间的相互了解和友谊，不利于国际和平与合作。
    特政委于6日开始讨论有关新闻的问题。
    许多发展中国家代表主张建立世界新闻新秩序，解决新闻的自由、均衡、双向流通问题，而一些西方国家代表以新闻自由为借口，对此持异议。
