The season of orange and tangerine. We visited the renowned citrus-producing area of Hengnan County's Baogai Township in southern Hunan. Walking through the orchards and visiting farmers, we were delighted to find that what made the farmers happy was not just the abundant harvest of oranges bending the branches, but also the refreshing breeze of clean governance.

How did this happen? Local township officials who are in the know first told us about an incident involving the destruction of orange trees.

It was last October, and the oranges were about to be harvested. As in previous years, the usually quiet township roads became bustling again. Various government agencies and leaders came in cars to purchase fresh citrus. Under the guise of purchasing, they would only pay a symbolic amount of money, and some would not even pay at all, just recording it in the books. Since these were their superiors, the village officials had no choice but to bear the loss of "discounted" and "free" oranges, as well as a large amount of entertainment expenses. According to a rough estimate from one village, Douhekou, last year alone, the amount of oranges sold at low prices or given away for free was at least 20,000 kilograms, resulting in a loss of over 100,000 yuan, with each farmer losing an average of over 12 yuan. Some farmers, unable to bear the frustration, uprooted the orange trees laden with fruit and told the village officials, "The root of the trouble is gone, and no one can come to take advantage anymore!"

This year, during the orange harvest season, no government agencies or leaders from the county or district came to request "special treatment." The dusty roads were no longer busy, and a farmer diligently guarding the orchard by the roadside was puzzled and asked us the reason. When he heard that the higher-ups were promoting clean governance and the county strictly prohibited the low-price purchase or free acquisition of fruits and local specialties from farmers, he happily smiled. According to a farmer from Xingfu Village, his family planted 8 mu of orange trees. In previous years, due to "special treatment" for officials who came by car, only about 300 kilograms were sold on the market. This year, it is estimated that over 3,000 kilograms of oranges will be harvested and sold on the market.

"Remember this good time, especially when the oranges are golden and the tangerines are green." Standing amidst the ten-li citrus township, witnessing the smiling faces of farmers during the orange harvest, we returned in high spirits. As we bid farewell, the township officials pointed to the complaint box and told us that so far, no farmers have come to report officials taking advantage, eating for free, or demanding oranges. Just this one aspect, the citrus farmers in the entire township can increase their income by over 500,000 yuan this year.

    橙黄时节
    橙黄桔绿时节。我们来到湘南颇有名气的柑桔产地衡南县宝盖乡，走桔园、访农家，惊喜地发现，使农民高兴的不仅是那黄桔压枝头的丰收景象，更有那一阵阵扑面而来的廉政之风。
    何以如此？了解内情的乡干部先给我们讲述了一起毁桔树事件。
    那是去年10月，桔子临近上市。与前些年一样，平常冷冷清清的乡土公路照例又开始热闹起来，这个机关、那个领导，纷纷坐车前来采购鲜柑。名为采购，其实只是象征性地付点款，有的甚至只记账，不给钱。由于来的都是顶头上司，村干部无奈，农民也只好“打掉门牙往肚里吞”，不仅要承担“折价”和“无偿”的损失，还要赔上一大笔招待费。据双河口一个村的初略统计，去年低价售出和白送的桔子少说也有两万公斤，损失上万元，每个农民人均12元多。一些农户气恼不过，便将一株株果实累累的桔树连根挖掉，然后对村干部说：“祸根挖掉啦，谁也别想再来揩油！”
    今年采桔季节，县、区没有一个机关或领导来人或写条子要求“照顾”的。公路上尘土飞扬的景象不见了，辛勤守护在路边桔园的一位农民挺纳闷，便问我们是啥原因。当他听到上头搞廉政、县里严禁向农户低价购买或无偿索要瓜果等土特产时，开心地露出了笑容。据幸福村一位农民介绍，他家种了8分地桔子树，往年因“照顾”坐车来的干部，上市出售的不过300多公斤，今年估计收摘桔子3000多公斤，可以全部上市。
    “一年好景君须记，最是橙黄桔绿时。”置身于十里桔乡，目睹农家采桔时的张张笑脸，我们乘兴而归。临别时，乡里干部指了指举报箱，对我们说，眼下还没发现有农民前来举报干部揩油、白吃、索要桔子的事情呢，就这一项，今年全乡桔农可增加收入5万多元。（贺广华　周友德　谢剑国）
