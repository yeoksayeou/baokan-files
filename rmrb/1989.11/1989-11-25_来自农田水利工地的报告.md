The initial winter in the north, many places have temperatures below zero. However, the agricultural water conservancy basic construction, with farmers as the main force, is in full swing, forming a national atmosphere of pushing agriculture forward.

The reporter's on-site observations from agricultural water conservancy construction sites in northern China bring people one piece of good news after another.

**Hebei Shijiazhuang: Practical and Effective Measures**

There are no slogans or banners, nor are there any red flags waving. On the agricultural water conservancy basic construction site in the Shijiazhuang region of Hebei, the reporter felt a practical and down-to-earth atmosphere.

On November 17, the north wind howled, and the cold air was biting. However, the villagers of Dongantaizhuang in Xingtang County, located at the eastern foot of the Taihang Mountains, were still sweating as they rushed to repair the irrigation canal. The reporter learned that the young woman Liang Shucui had worked more than 20 days, so he asked: "It's so cold, why are you still working?" She shyly replied: "For myself and for everyone else." Village Party Secretary Liang Daping walked along the 310-meter-long, 42-meter-wide, and 10-meter-high canal, telling the reporter: "The villagers speak the truth and put in real effort. This canal, if repaired a bit, can still be used, but we can't deceive ourselves or our descendants. If we put in a bit more effort now to widen it and pave it with concrete slabs, it won't break down for many years." County Magistrate Zhang Qi pointed to a dam under construction ahead and said: "After the dam and six irrigation stations are completed, the entire county can expand irrigation to more than 6,000 mu of farmland, creating more than 6,000 mu of orchards. At that time, you are welcome to come and taste the fruits."

Deputy County Magistrate Du Yongxin, who is in charge of agricultural basic construction, introduced the county's overall plan while inspecting the site. The plan adheres to practicality, proposing different requirements based on the different characteristics of mountainous, hilly, plain, and riverside villages and towns, ensuring that every township has a project and every village has a project, with each project being effective. In terms of policies and measures, attention is paid to being practical and seeking truth from facts. For example, for villages that can benefit but are not enthusiastic about repairing canals and using water, the agricultural drainage and irrigation diesel quota is reduced; based on the principle of "who contracts, who benefits," the barren mountains, slopes, and beaches within the contract period are allowed to be transferred and inherited at a discounted price. Farmers find these regulations practical, and they work with a sense of security.

The agricultural water conservancy basic construction in other counties and cities in the Shijiazhuang region is also progressing effectively. The regional leadership told the reporter: "Five mountainous counties mobilize an average of 200,000 laborers daily. So far, the region has repaired 109,000 meters of water-saving and anti-seepage pipelines and ditches, dredged and repaired 79 kilometers of old canals, and drilled or repaired 11,000 wells."

**Shanxi Xiyang County: Continuing to Create "Sponge Fields"**

On November 18, the reporter visited several villages in Jiedu, Fengju, and Zhaoqi in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, and saw that in some villages, farmers were driving donkeys to designated areas to level the land and thicken the embankments; others were digging deep pits in the stony riverbeds, replacing them with fertile soil, preparing to plant trees.

In Xiyang County, over the years, a group of talents in agricultural basic construction planning, design, and construction have been cultivated. Many villages have created projects of various sizes suitable to their local conditions. This winter, the entire county has mobilized 55,000 laborers and 920 tractors and bulldozers, with progress and quality that have exceeded people's expectations.

In the 1960s, Dazhai created "sponge fields" characterized by cultivating soil fertility and increasing the organic content of the soil, which was adopted by many farmers in the county and became a good method for increasing production. For more than 20 years, despite many ups and downs, farmers have always kept the construction of "sponge fields" in mind and have never abandoned it. Of the 400,000 mu of cultivated land in the county, 150,000 mu have now been turned into "sponge fields," becoming water-retaining, moisture-retaining, stable-yield, high-yield farmland. Since 1985, despite three consecutive years of severe drought, with some years receiving only 300 millimeters of rainfall, the county's average grain yield per mu still exceeded 250 kilograms, and this year's average grain yield reached 372 kilograms per mu.

At the land reclamation site in Zhaoqi Village, Zhaoqi Township, the reporter saw Chen Aimin and his siblings working up a sweat. They were responsible for transporting 60 cubic meters of soil and completed the task in four and a half days. I asked Chen Aimin: "What's the difference between working like this now and learning from Dazhai?" He said: "When we learned from Dazhai, we were working for the leaders, but now we are working for ourselves, and we are the leaders." This winter, Xiyang County's agricultural basic construction continues to focus on building "sponge fields": reclaiming 2,400 mu of land, repairing 8,000 mu of riverbed land, reclaiming 2,200 mu of cultivated land, and repairing 30,000 mu of sloping land. These targets have been completed by more than half. County Magistrate Wang Guining told the reporter that Xiyang will no longer engage in showy projects or "face-saving" projects, nor will it engage in "big rallies." It will focus on effectiveness, treating one piece of land, planting one piece of land, and benefiting one piece of land, firmly grasping the effectiveness.

**Henan Xinzheng County: Farmers Become the Main Investors**

Xinzheng County is famous in Henan for creating water-saving agriculture, which involves burying plastic water pipes in the fields to irrigate. County Magistrate Wang Fucheng told the reporter that this water conservancy facility saves 39% of water, 34% of electricity, and 1.7% of land. Last year, the county buried 300,000 meters of underground plastic water pipes, and this year plans to bury another 250,000 meters.

When talking about water conservancy construction, County Party Secretary Zhang Haiqin's enthusiasm surged. He introduced that this year, all levels of government and farmers have high enthusiasm for investing in water conservancy construction. Since the beginning of winter, in just half a month, farmers in the entire county have raised 5.41 million yuan, becoming the main investors in agriculture. When asked where the farmers' enthusiasm for investing in water conservancy comes from, he believed: first, the central government and the State Council emphasized grasping agricultural water conservancy basic construction, which is the key to stable and high-yield agriculture; second, farmers investing in water conservancy directly relates to their own interests; third, the law of value is at work, and this year the state has increased the price of contracted grain, and the market-adjusted part can be sold at a better price, meaning more input leads to more output.

The reporter did not see the so-called spectacular scene of everyone participating. However, every township has a project, every village has a task, and every household has work to do. Party Secretary Wang Genhua of Lihu Township, Xiantian Village, calculated an account: with irrigation conditions, the yield of wheat and corn per mu is 400 kilograms, and the highest exceeds 500 kilograms; without irrigation conditions, the yield of wheat per mu is only 150-250 kilograms, and corn is only 100 kilograms. Seeing this reality, the masses are therefore very enthusiastic about raising funds and labor this year. A provincial government official told the reporter that the entire province has raised 64.31 million yuan this winter and spring, and farmers have raised 230 million yuan. This winter and spring, these funds will be mainly used to complete existing supporting projects, solving problems such as having main canals without branch canals and having wells without supporting facilities.

**Liaoning Xinmin County: Unified Planning and Collective Water Management**

On November 20, the northeast was already frozen. In the cold wind, the reporter visited the agricultural water conservancy basic construction site in Zhangjiazhai Township, Xinmin County, Liaoning Province.

In Wuniang Village, the reporter met the village head Zhang Hengguo, who was drilling a well, and asked him: "Where does the funding for drilling wells come from?" "The state lends 100,000 yuan, and farmers raise 320,000 yuan, 100 yuan per mu." "So much, are they all willing to contribute?" "The hearts are united. In the past, water conservancy projects were for show, and the drilled wells killed the seedlings. Now there is an account: this year's severe drought resulted in a reduction of 600 kilograms per mu, equivalent to more than 300 yuan. If more wells are drilled, this 300 yuan will not be lost. To get 300 yuan, everyone is willing to contribute 100 yuan. Moreover, contributing once can bring long-term benefits." Therefore, this year alone, the village drilled 20 wells.

In Shuangchengbao Village, the reporter saw several kilometers of water conservancy troops, and asked the township water conservancy station head Gao Guowei: "Is this the people of one village?" Station Head Gao replied: "The entire township has 5,000 laborers, and there are 4,500 people here, with every village participating." "Are they all willing to invest and work?" "This has a process. After the responsibility system, each village managed water conservancy on its own, although projects were completed, due to lack of coordination, during severe droughts, water flowed in the river while people on the shore were worried. This educated everyone to concentrate financial and human resources and work together to manage water. This year, farmers in the entire township invested 1.6 million yuan, equivalent to three times the state investment."

**Shaanxi Xianyang Suburbs: Leaders Lead, Masses Are Energetic**

On November 19, the reporter visited Hanjiawan Village in the suburbs of Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province. Although there was no scene of "men, women, old, and young all participating," the winding cement-lined water canals were refreshing to the eyes.

Village head Huang Hongbin pointed to the new canal and said, "Our village's 2,100-meter canal was originally planned to be completed in a month, but with all the male and female laborers working together, it was completed in half a month, increasing 300 mu of irrigated land. Look, the dry land on the slope that hasn't seen water for many years can now be irrigated."

"Do the farmers have any objections to repairing canals and fields?"

"Working for ourselves, what objections can the farmers have?" Village head Huang smiled and said, "It's been many years since we last rang the bell. Now we blow the whistle to start work, and as soon as the whistle blows, everyone rushes to the construction site. Last night, the village held a meeting that lasted until midnight, and everyone's spirits were still high!"

Standing by, the young man Zhang Hulin continued, "In the past, without canals, during droughts, water was released to flood the fields, wasting a lot. Now with the canals, water, electricity, labor, and money are all saved!"

"Why is everyone so enthusiastic about water conservancy this year?"

"Leaders have great determination and put in a lot of effort, so the farmers naturally have high spirits!" Village head Huang said, "This year, focusing on water conservancy, the township and district heads have come here many times! Last night on TV, the provincial party secretary and governor also went to the countryside to repair water conservancy, and they also stipulated that all provincial government officials must participate in at least 15 days of agricultural labor each year!"

**Gansu Yuzhong County: Emphasizing Speed and Quality**

On November 18, the reporter drove to the northern mountain area of Yuzhong County, Gansu Province, to Zhonglianchuan and Gongmapi. Along the way, the mountains were undulating, and the gullies were crisscrossing, with barren yellow earth everywhere.

Upon arrival, it was learned that "Zhonglianchuan has no river, and Gongmapi has few wells." I asked Township Head Bai Daming, "Are the names of these places a bit misleading?" He smiled and said, "Mountain people love rivers and hope for water, so they name places with rivers and water for good luck." He then said that after the responsibility system, farmers worked individually, building "chicken coop fields" and "belt fields," scattered and not forming a situation. Now, with unified planning and comprehensive treatment, labor and time are relatively concentrated, and one mountain after another is being transformed. This year, the entire township's task of building 1,200 mu of new terraced fields was completed ahead of schedule in more than a month.

On the way to see the newly built terraced fields, I interviewed several farmers who were threshing. Song Luyuan's family of six and 40 mu of farmland, Song Mingyuan's family of four and 30 mu of farmland. Cultivating so much land, the grain is still not enough to eat. Upon careful inquiry, in normal years, each mu of land produces more than 100 kilograms of grain; this year, due to drought, only 70-80 kilograms were harvested.

However, the habit of extensive cultivation and relying on heaven for rain still seriously affects farmers' investment in land. For example, Song Luyuan's family currently has 5 mu of terraced fields, of which 3 mu were allocated during land contracting. Song Mingyuan's family is in a similar situation.

From conversations with cadres and the masses, it is felt that farmers have already realized from practice that building terraced fields is the best poverty alleviation project. Farmers call terraced fields "rice fields" and "subsistence fields."

I asked a farmer about the quality of the newly built terraced fields this year, and he said, "Build a little each year, truly returning living soil and deeply plowing dead soil, so that the built land can produce more grain. If the task is large and done in a rush, ignoring quality, it will break the rice bowl." Township Head Bai also admitted that there is such a phenomenon. Building terraced fields ensures the quality of the project to have an increased yield effect; having an increased yield effect makes farmers have sustained enthusiasm. In this major matter of farmers' livelihoods, we must not only focus on speed but also on quality.

**Shanxi Heshun County: Agricultural Construction as a Strategic Task**

Shanxi Heshun County has taken agricultural construction as a strategic task, adopting measures such as unified planning and comprehensive treatment in recent years, turning nearly 100,000 mu of farmland into stable and high-yield fields.

　　来自农田水利工地的报告
　　本报记者
    北方的初冬，许多地方气温已是零度以下。然而，以农民为主体的农田水利基本建设却热浪滚滚，全国形成把农业搞上去的大气候。
    记者在我国北方农田水利工地的现场见闻，报告给人们一个个可喜的信息。
      河北石家庄：因地制宜求实效
    看不见标语口号，也看不见红旗招展。在河北石家庄地区农田水利基本建设工地上，记者感受到的是扎实真干的氛围。
    11月17日，北风呼啸，寒气袭人。地处太行山东麓的行唐县东安太庄村民，仍在挥汗抢修扬水站渠道。记者得知女青年梁淑清已出工20多个，便问：这么冷的天，你还在干？她腼腆地回答：为自己，也为大伙儿。村党支部书记梁大平沿着长310米、宽42米、高10米的渠道边走边告诉记者：“村民讲的是实话，掏的是实劲。这渠小修一下也能用，但不能糊弄自己，糊弄子孙。现在费点劲加宽，用水泥板砌好，多少年也坏不了。”乡长张琪用手指着前边一道正在施工的拦河坝说：水坝和6座扬水站修好后，全乡可扩浇6000多亩耕地，造成6000多亩果园。到时请你来尝鲜儿。
    主抓农田基本建设的杜永新副县长一边看现场，一边介绍县里的总体规划。规划坚持从实际出发，根据山区、丘陵、平原及沿河村镇的不同特点，提出不同要求，做到乡乡有工程，村村有项目，件件有效果。在政策和措施上注意因地制宜，实事求是。如对能受益而不积极修渠用水的乡村，核减农排、农灌柴油指标；本着“谁承包，谁受益”的原则，在承包期内的荒山、荒坡、荒滩允许折价转让和继承。农民认为这些法规实在，干起来心里踏实。
    石家庄地区其它县、市，今冬农田水利基本建设也搞得卓有成效。行署领导告诉记者：5个山区县每天平均出动劳力达20万人。到目前为止，全区已修节水防渗管道垄沟等109万余米，修复清淤旧渠道79公里，新打机井、修旧井1.1万余眼。（陈国琦）
    山西昔阳县：继续营造“海绵田”
    11月18日，记者来到山西昔阳县的界都、凤居、赵壁等7个乡的一些村庄，看见有的村农民赶着骡子到划定的地段拉土垫厚滩地；有的在干石河滩挖一深坑，换上熟土，准备栽树。
    在昔阳县，多年来造就了一批农田基本建设规划、设计、施工人才，许多村因地制宜，营造改田、造地的大小不同的工程。今冬全县已投入劳力5.5万人，推土机拖拉机920余台，进度之快，质量之高，是出乎人们意料的。
    60年代初，大寨创造了以培肥地力增加土壤有机质含量为特征的“海绵田”，被全县许多农民接受，成为增产的好办法。连续20余年，经过多少风风雨雨，但农民心里有底，始终没有把建造“海绵田”丢掉。全县40万亩耕地中，如今已有15万亩造成“海绵田”，即成了蓄水保墒稳产高产农田。1985年以来，连续3年大旱，有的年份全年降水仅300毫米，全县粮食平均亩产仍在250公斤以上，今年亩均产粮达372公斤。
    在赵壁乡赵壁村的造地工地，记者见到陈爱明家兄妹3人，个个干得汗流满面。他们共分到拉运60立方土的定额，用4天半全部干完。我问陈爱明：“现在这样干，和学大寨有什么不同？”他说：“学大寨那阵是给领导干，现在是给自己干，自己就是领导。”今冬昔阳县农田基本建设继续围绕修建“海绵田”展开：造地2400亩，复垫河滩地8000亩，复垦耕地2200亩，整修二坡地3万亩。这些目标，已完成一半以上。县长王桂宁告诉记者，昔阳再不搞花架子，不搞“面子工程”，不搞“大呼隆”，治一块，种一块，得利一块，紧紧抓住实效不放。（王艾生）
    河南新郑县：农民成了投入主体
    新郑县因创造了节水农业，即在田间地下埋设塑料水管浇地而闻名河南。县长王福成对记者说，这种水利设施节水39％，节电34％，节地1.7％。去年全县埋设地下塑料水管30万米，今年计划再埋25万米。
    谈到水利建设，县委书记张海钦劲头就来了。他介绍，今年各级政府和农民群众对水利建设的投资热情高。入冬以来仅半个月时间，全县农民集资541万元，成了农业投入的主体。谈到农民集资办水利的积极性从哪儿来，他认为：一是中央、国务院强调抓好农田水利基本建设抓住了农业稳产高产的关键；二是农民投资办水利，直接关系自身利益；三是价值规律在起作用，今年国家提高了定购粮的价格，市场调节部分更可卖好价钱，投入多就意味着产出多。
    记者没有看到万人齐上阵的所谓壮观场面。但乡乡有工程，村村有任务，户户有活干。梨河乡学田村党支部书记王根华算了一笔帐：有水利条件的小麦、玉米亩产400公斤，高的超出500公斤；没有灌溉条件的，小麦亩产才150——250公斤，而玉米仅100公斤。群众看到了这个现实，因此今年集资投工积极性特高。省政府负责同志告诉记者，全省各地、市、县今冬已筹集资金6431万元，农民集资2.3亿元。今冬明春用这些钱除新建工程外，主要搞好现有配套工程，解决有干渠无支渠，有井不配套的问题。　　（李　杰）
    辽宁新民县：统一规划团结治水
    11月20日，关东已经结冰。在寒风中，记者到辽宁新民县张家屯乡，采访农田水利基本建设工地。
    在乌牛村，记者碰到正打机井的村长张恒国，问他：“打井资金哪来？”“国家贷款10万元，农民自筹32万元，每亩地100元。”“这么多，都愿拿吗？”“心齐得很，过去搞水利图形式，打了机井旱死苗，国家出钱也不愿干。如今有笔帐：今年大旱，每亩减产600斤合300多元，如果多打些机井，这300元就丢不掉。为得300元，都愿出100元。而且，出一次可长期得好处。”因此，仅这个村，今年就打20眼机井。
    在双城堡村，记者看到几公里长的水利大军，问乡水利站长高国维：“这是一个村的人？”高站长答：“全乡5000劳力，这里就有4500人，村村都有。”“大家都愿投资、出工？”“这有个过程。大包干后，在水利建设上各自为政，虽搞了工程，但由于互不相通，遇到大旱还是水在河中流，人在岸上愁。这教育了大家要集中财力人力，团结治水。今年全乡农民投资160万元，相当国家投资的3倍。”

    陕西咸阳市郊：干部带头群众劲足
    11月19日，记者来到陕西咸阳市郊区韩家湾跃进村。在村里虽没看到“男女老少齐动员”的场景，那蜿蜒逶迤的用水泥新砌起的水渠，却使人耳目一新。
    村长黄鸿斌指着新渠说，俺村2100米的水渠，原计划一个月完工，可全村男女劳力一伙上，只用半个月就完工了，可新增水田300多亩。你看，那坡地上多少年没见过水的旱地，也可以浇水了。”
      “农民对修渠修田没意见吧？”
      “给自己干哩，农民有啥意见？”黄村长笑着说，“多少年没打铃了。现在吹哨上工，哨音一响，‘刷’地都上了工地。昨晚村里开会，开到夜里12点，大伙精神还蛮大呢！”
    站在一旁的青年后生张虎林接上话茬：“过去没渠，旱天一放水，漫地流，浪费大着哩！现在修了渠，既省水、省电，又省力、省钱！”
    “今年大家干水利为啥劲这么大？”
    “领导决心大，下力抓，农民自然劲鼓得圆！”黄村长说：“今年抓水利，乡长、区长不知跑来多少回！昨晚电视上，省委书记、省长都下乡修水利，还规定全省机关干部每年至少参加15天农业劳动哩！”　　　（孟西安）
    甘肃榆中县：讲速度更重质量
    11月18日，记者驱车前往甘肃榆中县北山地区的中连川和贡马井。一路上，山峦起伏，沟壑纵横，满目是贫瘠的黄土地。
    赶到现场才知道，“中连川无川，贡马井少井”。我问乡长白大明：“这里的地名是不是有点名不副实？”他笑了笑：“山里人爱川盼水，起个带川挂水的地名，图个吉利。”接着说，大包干后，农民一家一户地干，修的是“鸡窝田”和“皮带田”，零零散散，形不成气候。现在统一规划，连片治理，劳力、时间相对集中，一个山头一个山头地搞，用不了几年，山区的面貌就会大变样。今年全乡1200亩新修梯田任务，一个多月时间就超额完成了。
    在去看新修梯田的路上，我访问了几位正打场的农民。宋禄元一家6口、40亩耕地，宋明元一家4口、30亩耕地。种这么多地，粮食还不够吃。仔细一打听，平年每亩地产粮百十多斤；今年天旱，只收七八十斤。
    但是，耕作粗放、靠天吃饭的习惯势力，仍然严重影响农民增加对土地的投入。如宋禄元一家现有梯田5亩，其中3亩还是土地承包时划分的。宋明元家的情况也如此。
    同干部群众交谈中感到，如今农民从实践中已经看出，修梯田是最好的扶贫项目。农民称梯田是“吃饭田”、“温饱田”。
    我向一个农民打听今年新修梯田的质量，他说：“逐年修些，真正做到活土还原，死土深翻，修下的地能多打粮食。任务一大，搞成突击，不顾质量，就把饭碗砸了。”白乡长也承认，确有这种现象。修梯田保证工程质量才有增产效应；有增产效应农民才会有持久的积极性。在关系农民吃饭这件大事上，确实不能只顾速度，不顾质量。
