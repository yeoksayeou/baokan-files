Determining the production quota for the first half of next year and the production allocation for each member state is the central topic of the 86th ministerial meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to be held in Vienna.

At the 84th ministerial meeting last year, the dispute over the quotas of Iran and Iraq was resolved, but Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been dissatisfied with the production quotas assigned to them by OPEC and have insisted on overproducing. In the fourth quarter of this year, Kuwait's production quota is 1.149 million barrels per day, but the actual output is 1.9 million barrels; the UAE's production quota is 1.094 million barrels per day, but the actual output exceeds 2.2 million barrels. Currently, the total actual production of OPEC is 23 million barrels per day, while the production limit for the fourth quarter is 20.5 million barrels. The excess production mainly comes from Kuwait and the UAE. If such large-scale overproduction continues, it will threaten the stability of the market and oil prices.

To eliminate market risks and meet Kuwait and the UAE's demands for increased quotas, at the expanded meeting of the OPEC Market Monitoring Committee in September, Iran proposed a plan. The core of the plan is to increase the daily production quota by 1 million barrels, with one-third allocated to Kuwait, one-third to the UAE, and the remaining one-third to Ecuador, Gabon, and Qatar. Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Iraq would maintain their current quotas. Algeria, Indonesia, Venezuela, Libya, and Nigeria have either reached or are close to their production capacities, so their quotas can be slightly reduced. Since the plan involves the reallocation of the entire distribution ratio, it was not approved at that meeting. However, it was suggested that member state representatives consider it.

According to Reuters, Saudi Arabia has proposed a new idea before this meeting. The main contents are: the proposed OPEC production quota for the first half of 1990 is 21.5 to 22 million barrels per day. Kuwait and the UAE can obtain more shares; Saudi Arabia remains unchanged, still accounting for 24.46% of the total quota. Some member states with remaining production capacity can adjust their shares accordingly. Those member states with little remaining production capacity, especially Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, and Libya, will maintain their current production quotas or have a slight increase, while some countries may need to reduce their production shares.

There will likely be a debate at the meeting regarding OPEC's production limit for the first half of next year, especially the production quotas for each member state.

Iran's Minister of Petroleum, Gholam-Reza Aghazadeh, told reporters that Iran's plan remains the basis for negotiations. He said, "I think this is the best way to guide the discussion of other ideas."

Saudi Arabia's Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Hisham Nazer, said, "We are working to find a solution." "Various opinions are being considered."

　　欧佩克面临新难题
　　新华社记者　强玉才
    确定明年上半年的生产限额和各成员国的生产配额，是即将在维也纳召开的石油输出国组织（欧佩克）第86次部长级会议的中心议题。
    在去年第84次部长级会议上解决了两伊配额之争以后，科威特和阿拉伯联合酋长国不满于欧佩克给它们的生产配额而一直坚持超配额生产。今年第4季度科威特的生产配额为每天114.9万桶，而实际产量在190万桶；阿联酋的生产配额为每天109.4万桶，而实际产量在220万桶以上。目前整个欧佩克的实际产量为每天2300万桶，而其第4季度的生产限额为2050万桶。超产部分主要来自科威特和阿联酋。这样大幅度地超产如果长期下去，会危及市场和石油价格的稳定。
    为了消除市场隐患和满足科威特和阿联酋要求增加配额的愿望，在今年9月份欧佩克市场监督委员会扩大会议上，伊朗曾提出一项计划，其中心内容是增加日产100万桶的定额，其中1／3给科威特，1／3给阿联酋，剩下的1／3给厄瓜多尔、加蓬和卡塔尔；沙特、伊朗和伊拉克则保持现有的配额；阿尔及利亚、印度尼西亚、委内瑞拉、利比亚和尼日利亚的生产配额或已到了或已接近它们的生产能力，可适当缩减它们的配额。因该计划涉及整个分配比例的重新确定，未能在那次会议上获得通过。但要求各成员国代表予以考虑。
    据路透社报道，沙特阿拉伯在这次会议前提出一种新的设想，其主要内容有：1990年上半年的欧佩克生产定额建议为每天2150万桶至2200万桶。科威特和阿联酋可以获得更多的份额；沙特维持不变，仍占总定额的24.46％。一些尚有剩余生产能力的成员国可根据其剩余生产能力的大小作部分调整。那些已无多少剩余生产能力的成员国，特别是阿尔及利亚、印度尼西亚、伊朗和利比亚保持现有的生产定额或稍有提高，还有一些国家兴许要缩减其生产份额。
    围绕欧佩克明年上半年的生产限额，特别是各成员国的生产配额问题，估计会上将有一番争论。
    伊朗石油部长古·拉姆·礼萨·阿加扎德对记者们说，伊朗计划仍然是谈判的基础。他说，“我想，这是引导讨论其它设想的最好路子”。
    沙特石油和矿业资源大臣希沙姆·纳泽尔说，“我们正在努力寻求一项解决办法”。“有各种各样的意见正在考虑”。
