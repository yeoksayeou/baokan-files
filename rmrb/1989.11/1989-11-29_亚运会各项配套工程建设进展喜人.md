The construction of supporting projects for the 11th Asian Games is progressing smoothly, with most of the municipal public utilities infrastructure already completed. This is what the reporter Fei Weiwei learned at the "100-Day Campaign Summary and Award Ceremony for the Asian Games Projects and Winter-Spring Mobilization Meeting" held today.

At today's meeting, relevant officials summarized the progress of the Asian Games supporting projects with the eight characters: "Progress is smooth, achievements are encouraging."

It is also learned that the comprehensive environmental improvement work around the 30 competition venues, 8 training venues, and 100 main roads connecting the venues for the Asian Games has completed 2,903 treatment projects, accounting for 37% of the total. These comprehensive treatment projects include dust removal for boilers, river improvement, noise and exhaust gas treatment, and the demolition of pollution sources in the water source core area. All comprehensive treatment projects will be completed by the end of June next year.

The deputy commander of the Asian Games engineering project made a summary and mobilization speech at today's meeting. He pointed out that although the Asian Games engineering project has achieved victories in various stages, the final victory has not yet been achieved, and the situation remains severe. To seize the final victory, a final sprint is still needed. The meeting called on all builders of the Asian Games engineering project and leaders at all levels of the participating units to seize the last opportunity of this winter and next spring, strive for another 200 days, spare no effort, and ensure that the Asian Games engineering tasks are fully completed on time.

　　亚运会各项配套工程建设进展喜人
    本报北京11月28日讯　记者费伟伟报道：距开幕式已不到300天的第十一届亚运会各项配套工程建设进展顺利。市政公用工程设施大部分已经完成。这是记者在今天举行的“亚运会工程大干100天总结表彰暨今冬明春动员大会”上了解到的情况。
    在今天的大会上，有关方面负责人用“进展顺利、成绩喜人”8个字来概括亚运会配套工程建设。
    另据了解，亚运会30个比赛场馆、8个练习场馆周围以及联接各馆的100条主要道路的环境综合整治工作已完成治理项目2903项，占总数的37％。这些综合治理项目包括锅炉等除尘、河道整治、噪声和废气治理、水源核心区污染源的拆迁等。所有综合治理项目将于明年6月底以前完成。
    亚运会工程副总指挥在今天的会上作了总结动员报告。他指出，亚运会工程虽已取得各阶段战役的胜利，但还没取得最后胜利，形势依然很严峻，夺取最后的胜利还需要进行最后的冲刺。大会号召全体亚运会工程建设者、参建单位的各级领导充分抓紧今冬明春的最后时机，再拚上200天，不惜一切代价，保证亚运会工程任务全面按时完成。
