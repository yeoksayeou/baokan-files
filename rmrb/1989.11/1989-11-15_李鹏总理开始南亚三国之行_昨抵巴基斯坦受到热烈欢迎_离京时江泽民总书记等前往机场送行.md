BEIJING, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) — At the invitation of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, President H.M. Ershad of Bangladesh, and Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai of the Kingdom of Nepal, Premier Li Peng of the State Council left Beijing this morning for official friendly visits to the three countries. General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Jiang Zemin saw him off at the airport.

Before departing, Premier Li Peng held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists at the capital airport. Li Peng said that China is willing to develop friendly neighborly relations with the three countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and expressed the hope that China will play an active role in promoting peace in the South Asian region and the world.

In response to a question from a Yugoslav journalist, Li Peng said that China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are friendly neighboring countries, and Comrade Kim Il-sung is an old friend of China. He visits China every year. During our talks, we exchanged views on a wide range of issues, including the international situation and Sino-DPRK relations. We naturally pay close attention to the situation on the Korean Peninsula. He reiterated China's consistent support for Chairman Kim Il-sung's policy of independent and peaceful reunification of Korea and the establishment of the Democratic Confederation of Koryo. He said that whether the recent events in the Democratic Republic of Germany mean the unification of Germany remains to be seen.

Premier Li Peng's wife, Zhu Lin, was also invited to accompany the visit. Accompanying the visit were also Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin, and others.

Those who saw Premier Li Peng off at the airport included Vice Premiers Tian Jiyun and Wu Xueqian, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Peng Chong, and Secretary-General of the State Council Luo Gan, among others.

They were warmly welcomed by the Pakistani government and people.

This is Premier Li Peng's first visit to Pakistan since taking office as Premier of the State Council, and it is the first overseas visit by a Chinese leader after China's decisive victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion. It has attracted great attention and high praise from public opinion here.

When the special plane carrying Premier Li Peng and his party stopped on the tarmac, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Tian Ding and his wife, as well as Pakistani protocol officials, boarded the plane to welcome Premier Li Peng. When Premier Li Peng and his wife stepped off the plane, two children presented them with flowers. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, who had been waiting at the foot of the stairs, stepped forward to extend a warm welcome and cordial greetings. This is the second meeting between the two premiers in the past nine months. Benazir Bhutto said, "Welcome to Pakistan." Li Peng said, "Thank you very much." Then, Benazir Bhutto introduced to Li Peng the Pakistani Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, General Sharif, and the three service chiefs, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the head of the escort team, among others.

A grand welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. Premier Li Peng, accompanied by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, walked down the red carpet and ascended the reviewing stand. The honor guard presented arms, and the military band played the national anthems of China and Pakistan. Amidst 19 gun salutes, Premier Li Peng, accompanied by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, inspected the Pakistani three-service honor guard. Afterwards, Premier Li Peng and his wife met cordially with the Pakistani Senate President, Speaker of the National Assembly, cabinet ministers, prominent figures, and diplomatic envoys from various countries who came to welcome them.

Thousands of people gathered on the platform of the terminal building and the square on the left side of the tarmac to welcome the guests, waving the national flags of China and Pakistan and bouquets, and shouting "Long live China-Pakistan friendship!"

Accompanying Premier Li Peng on the visit were Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin, and Vice Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army He Qizong, among others.

In a written statement delivered at the airport, Premier Li Peng said, "I am honored to make an official friendly visit to the friendly neighboring country of Pakistan, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, and I am very happy." "China and Pakistan are friendly neighboring countries connected by mountains and rivers. There is a deep traditional friendship between the two peoples. Further consolidating and developing the friendly cooperative relationship that already exists between China and Pakistan is the common wish of the peoples of the two countries. This not only serves the interests of both China and Pakistan but also helps to maintain peace and stability in this region."

Premier Li Peng and his wife, accompanied by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, left the airport for the Pakistani state guesthouse. Thousands of citizens gathered on both sides of the road, either singing and dancing to lively music or waving flags and bouquets to cheer for the Chinese guests.

It is reported that this afternoon, Premier Li Peng of China and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan held a small-scale meeting. The meeting was conducted in a very friendly and cordial atmosphere. Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen also participated in the meeting.
