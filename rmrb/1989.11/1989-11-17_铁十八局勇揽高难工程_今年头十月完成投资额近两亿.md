The 18th Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, facing a construction market with intense competition and limited opportunities, has relied on hard work and technological breakthroughs to bravely undertake high, large, difficult, and cutting-edge transportation and energy projects. From January to October this year, the bureau completed an investment of nearly 200 million yuan, setting a new historical record for the same period and turning the crisis into an opportunity.

The trends of reducing construction scale and modernizing engineering projects have made the bureau realize that it cannot remain stagnant and must meet the urgent needs of the state. They have decided to explore new avenues, fearlessly taking on new types of projects. They have successively undertaken the largest limestone region tunnel in Asia—the Qingjiang Isheyan Diversion Tunnel in Hubei, the Banzhu Mountain Tunnel in Zhuhai, and high-difficulty transportation and energy projects such as the Daqin Line and the Doupeng Power Plant.

The state and local key projects undertaken by the 18th Bureau generally have high standards and tight deadlines. The employees of this bureau, who have long been accustomed to traversing mountains and rivers, have carried on the spirit of hard work. During the construction in Zhuhai, surrounded by neon lights and wine, they insisted on staying in tents on the hillside, with cadres and workers practicing the "three togethers," enduring wind and rain. In five months, they completed a 1,210-meter tunnel, with no serious injuries, setting a national record for the fastest monthly progress in similar construction projects.

    铁十八局勇揽高难工程
    今年头十月完成投资额近两亿
    本报天津11月16日电　记者肖荻报道：面对建筑市场“僧多粥少”、竞争激烈的局面，铁道部第18工程局靠艰苦奋斗和科技攻关，勇于承建高、大、难、尖的交通、能源等新类型工程。今年1至10月完成投资额1.9亿多元，创造本局历史同期最高水平，把危机变成了生机。
    压缩基建规模和工程项目日益现代化这两大趋势，使这个局认识到：不能因循守旧，必须面向国家急需。他们下决心广开门路，不怕高、不惧大、不畏难，涉足新类型工程，先后承揽了亚洲石灰岩地区最大断面输水隧洞——湖北清江隔河岩导流隧洞，珠海板樟山公路隧道，以及大秦线、陡河电厂等高难度交通、能源工程。
    18工程局承揽的这些国家或地方重点工程，大都要求标准高、工期紧。长年跋山涉水的这个局员工，发扬了艰苦奋斗的作风。在珠海施工中，周围灯红酒绿，他们坚持住山坡帐篷，干部和工人实行“三同”，风餐露宿，5个月贯通1210米隧洞，未发生一个重伤号，创全国同类型施工月进度最快纪录。
