    China's annual production of caustic soda has reached 3 million tons, making it the fifth largest producer in the world.

    The chlor-alkali industry is a fundamental materials industry essential for paper making, textiles, smelting, and other sectors, playing a crucial role in the national economy. In 1929, China established its first chlor-alkali plant using salt electrolysis to produce caustic soda. By 1949, the country's annual caustic soda production was only 150,000 tons.

    Since liberation, China's chlor-alkali industry has developed rapidly, achieving major technological breakthroughs such as the mercury process, vertical diaphragm process, diaphragm metal anode process, and ion membrane process. In recent years, outdated technologies like the mercury process have been gradually phased out. Advanced ion membrane technology from the 1980s has been rapidly adopted, leading to a steady increase in caustic soda production. Currently, the annual production capacity is 3.2 million tons, with over 200 types of chlorine products. More than 30 varieties have entered the international market, generating nearly $50 million in foreign exchange annually.

    从1.5万吨到300万吨
    我烧碱年产量居世界第五
    本报讯　我国烧碱年产量已达到300万吨，跃居世界第五位。
    氯碱工业是基本原材料工业，造纸、纺织、冶炼等都离不开它，在国民经济中占有重要地位。1929年我国才建成第一家以食盐电解生产烧碱的氯碱厂，到1949年，全国烧碱年产量只有1.5万吨。
    解放后，我国氯碱工业迅速发展，先后实现了水银法、立式隔膜法、隔膜金属阳极法和离子膜法等重大技术突破。近年来又逐渐淘汰水银法等落后的技术，80年代世界上先进的离子膜技术得到迅速应用，烧碱产量逐年增长，现在年生产能力达到320万吨，氯产品200余种，有30多个品种打入国际市场，年创汇近5000万美元。　（沈飞）
