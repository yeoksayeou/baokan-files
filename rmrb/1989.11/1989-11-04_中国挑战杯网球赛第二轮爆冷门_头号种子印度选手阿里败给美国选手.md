The second round of the 1989 China Challenge Cup International Tennis Tournament saw a major upset today. The top seed, Indian player Ali, lost to American player David Hackness with a score of 7-6, 5-7, 3-6.

China's 20-year-old player from Shanghai, Xia Jia Ping, also created a significant upset today. He defeated the strong German player Hin Markus with a score of 7-5, 6-3, advancing to the quarterfinals.

Standing at only 1.68 meters, Xia Jia Ping's best national ranking is fourth. Against the 1.95-meter-tall Markus, Xia Jia Ping fully utilized his agility and varied tactics, maintaining an aggressive stance throughout the match. This disrupted Markus's strategy, which relied heavily on power. When the referee called the score 0-2 against him, Markus shook his head in disbelief.

Markus told reporters, "Yesterday, I defeated South Korea's second-ranked player Yu Zhen Xian, and I became overly confident. I did not take Xia Jia Ping seriously mentally."

Another Chinese player, Zhang Jiu Hua, lost today with two 4-6 scores against the Asian champion Kim Jae-Deok (South Korea), missing out on the quarterfinals.

The other five players who advanced to the quarterfinals are South Korea's Kim Bong-Su, Song Dong-Hui, the United States' Smith, New Zealand's Bruce, and Japan's Tsuchi Hashi Seikiku.

Today, the first round of men's doubles matches was also held. Four Chinese pairs participated, with Liu Shu Hua/Pan Bing, Meng Qiang Hua/Wang Yue, and Dai Xidong/Liu Xiaocheng all advancing to the quarterfinals. Zhang Jiu Hua/Xia Jia Ping lost 0-2 to American players.

    中国挑战杯网球赛第二轮爆冷门
    头号种子印度选手阿里败给美国选手
    新华社北京11月2日电  （记者梁金雄）1989年中国挑战杯国际网球赛今天进入第二轮，头号种子印度的阿里大意失荆州，以7∶6、5∶7、3∶6负于美国的戴维·哈克尼斯。
    我国20岁上海选手夏加平今天也爆出不小的冷门，他以7∶5、6∶3挫败实力不弱的联邦德国选手欣·马尔库斯，跻身八强之列。
    身高仅1米68的夏加平在全国最好成绩为第四名，他面对身高1米95的马尔库斯，充分发挥“小、快、灵”的特长，以灵活的步伐和多变的战术，全场积极进攻，使以力量为主的对手乱了章法。当裁判员判他0∶2失利后，马尔库斯摇着头，难以相信这是事实。
    马尔库斯对记者说，昨天他击败南朝鲜二号选手俞镇先后，过于乐观，没有在思想上对夏加平予以重视。
    我国另一位进入第二轮比赛的选手张九华今天以两个4∶6负于亚洲锦标赛冠军金载堤（南朝鲜），与八强无缘。
    进入八强的另外五名选手分别是南朝鲜的金奉洙、宋东煜，美国的史密斯，新西兰的布鲁斯和日本的土桥澄之久。
    今天还进行了男双第一轮比赛，中国选手有4对出场，结果刘树华／潘兵、孟强华／王越和戴曦东／刘晓成分别战胜各自对手，进入八强。张九华／夏加平以0∶2负于美国选手。
