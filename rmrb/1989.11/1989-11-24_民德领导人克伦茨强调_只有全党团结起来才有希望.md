East German leader Krenz emphasizes
only party unity holds hope

New China News Agency, Berlin, November 22 — The General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Chairman of the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic, Krenz, emphasized on the 22nd that without the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, there would be no German Democratic Republic. The working-class party must play a role in the mass movement.

According to the DPA, Krenz made these remarks during an inspection of a factory in Berlin.

When discussing his views on the upcoming special party congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Krenz said that this special party congress will elect a new Central Committee, elaborate on the tasks facing the party in the current situation, and find solutions to the problems currently existing, that is, what the answer to modern socialism is.

Krenz said that the congress must be a frank and uncompromising one. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany has a chance and hope only if it unites.

He said that the 40 years of the German Democratic Republic were not in vain, but if people could have combined socialism with democracy earlier, even greater achievements could have been made.

　　民德领导人克伦茨强调
　　只有全党团结起来才有希望
    新华社柏林11月22日电　德国统一社会党中央总书记、民主德国国务委员会主席克伦茨22日强调指出，没有德国统一社会党就没有民主德国，工人阶级政党必须在群众运动中发挥作用。
    据德通社报道，克伦茨是在视察柏林一家工厂时说这番话的。
    在谈到对即将召开的德国统一社会党特别党代表大会的看法时，克伦茨说，这次特别党代表大会将选出一个新的中央委员会，阐述党在目前形势下面临的任务，并找到解决当前存在的问题，即什么是现代社会主义的答案。
    克伦茨说，大会必须是一次不妥协的坦率的大会。德国统一社会党只有团结起来才有机会和希望。
    他说，民主德国的40年并不是徒劳无益的，但如果人们很早就能够把社会主义与民主结合起来，还会取得比现在更大的成就。
