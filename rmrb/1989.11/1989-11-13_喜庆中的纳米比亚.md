The world's attention is focused on Namibia's constitutional assembly elections, which are proceeding in an orderly and tense manner. This election is a crucial step towards Namibia's independence. For the Namibian people, who have endured a century of colonial rule, this is a day of great joy and celebration.

Voters Form Long Lines

November 7th was the first day of the election. Voters flocked to the 350-plus polling stations set up in 23 districts across the country. At a polling station in Katutura, a black residential area in the capital Windhoek, the reporter saw about four to five thousand people standing in an orderly queue stretching approximately two kilometers. Among them were elderly people over seventy, young men and women dressed in bright or colorful clothing, and women holding umbrellas of various colors, some cradling infants. Under the bright sunlight, from a distance, they looked like a colorful ribbon winding through the landscape. The voters' enthusiasm was high, and within just three days, the number of people who had voted nationwide reached over 80% of the total registered voters, far exceeding the expected pace of the election.

Mobile Polling Stations Go Missing

The Ovambo region in northern Namibia is home to nearly half of the country's population, but due to its vast expanse and scattered residents, it still appears sparsely populated. Therefore, 175 polling stations were set up, more than half of which were mobile. Election officials traveled by off-road vehicles and even helicopters to remote areas to find voters. One mobile polling station disappeared in the vast wilderness and did not return overnight, so a helicopter was sent to search for it. Additionally, an election official was bitten by a snake, fortunately, the injury was not severe. Thanks to the joint efforts of the United Nations and local administrative officials, 90% of voters in Ovambo had cast their ballots in the first three days of the election.

Blind Voters Can Vote Publicly

Secret voting is a principle stipulated in United Nations Resolution 435, ensuring that voters have the right to choose the party they support without anyone else knowing.

However, in special circumstances, this important principle must be adapted. On the first day of voting in a black township on the outskirts of Windhoek, a blind voter, accompanied by his sister, arrived at the polling station. After listening to the election procedures, he was still unable to fill out the ballot paper himself. After consultation, in the presence of a United Nations supervisor and a local official, the blind voter verbally stated his vote for the South West Africa People's Organization, and his sister marked an "X" next to the party's symbol. The two officials said: "Although this ballot revealed the secret, it is still valid."

The Most Supervised Election in History

In the history of elections, probably no country has had its election supervised by so many nations and international organizations. The number of supervisors and observers can be said to be the highest in the world. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Namibia has over 7,400 personnel, including military, police, civilian staff, and election officials. They come from 109 countries to supervise and ensure free and fair elections to guarantee Namibia's ultimate independence.

Including the Organization of African Unity and the Non-Aligned Movement, over 30 countries and international organizations have sent observers to closely monitor whether the election is conducted fairly and freely. China has also sent 20 election supervisors, who are performing their duties in the most remote Kaprivi region in northeastern Namibia. Various countries' parliamentary delegations and representatives from non-governmental organizations have been arriving continuously, with dozens already present.

    喜庆中的纳米比亚
    新华社记者　熊仲琪　王定芳
    举世瞩目的纳米比亚独立前制宪议会选举正在紧张而有秩序地进行。此次大选是纳米比亚走向独立的重要阶段。这对遭受百年殖民统治的纳米比亚人民来说是一个大喜大庆的日子。
            选民排起长龙
    11月7日是选举的第一天。选民们一大早就涌向设在全国23个选区的350多个投票站。笔者在首都温得和克黑人居住区卡图图拉的一个投票站，看到约有四五千人井然有序地排成一条长龙。他们中有年逾古稀的老人，有身着艳丽或色调明快服装的男女青年，还有打着各色花伞的妇女，有的怀中抱着婴儿。在灿烂的阳光下，远远望去像一条五光十色的彩带，蜿蜒伸展约两公里。选民们投票热情、踊跃，仅在3天之内，全国投票人数已达选民总数的80％以上，比预期的选举进度快得多。
            流动投票站失踪
    纳北部奥万博地区集中了全国约一半的人口，但因地域辽阔，居民分散，仍然显得人烟稀少。因此不得不设立175个投票站，其中一半以上是流动投票站。选举人员乘越野车甚至直升飞机去到边远地区寻找选民投票，其中一个流动站，在无边无际的荒原中失踪，一夜未归，只好派直升飞机去寻找。还有一名选举官员被蛇咬伤，幸运的是伤势不严重。由于联合国和当地行政官员的共同努力，奥万博在前3天的选举日中，90％的选民已投票。盲人可以公开投票
    秘密投票，是联合国435号决议规定的一个原则。它的内容是保证投票人有权选择自己拥护的政党，而不为任何他人所知道。
    但是这一重要原则，在特殊情况下，也不得不作些变通。在温市郊区黑人城镇投票的第一天，一个盲人选民在他妹妹搀扶下来到投票站，听了办理选举手续的介绍后，仍不能自己填写选票。于是，经过协商，在一名联合国监督人员和一名当地官员在场的情况下，盲人口述他投西南非洲人民组织的票，并由他妹妹在人组标志后划×。这两位官员都说：虽然这张选票公开了秘密，但仍有效。选举之最
    在世界选举史上，大概没有一个国家的选举是在这么多国家和国际组织的监督下进行的。监督、观察选举的人数可谓世界之最。联合国驻纳米比亚援助团人员达7400多人，包括军人、警察、文职人员和选举官员。他们来自世界109个国家，监督、实行自由公正的选举以确保纳米比亚最终实现独立。
    包括非统组织和不结盟运动在内的30多个国家和国际组织的观察员，正密切关注选举是否能做到公正自由的进行。中国也派出了20名选举监督员，他们在纳东北部最偏僻的卡普里维地区执行监督选举任务。来这里实地考察的各国议员代表团，民间机构代表团络绎不绝，迄今已达数十个之多。
