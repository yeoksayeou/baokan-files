The renowned Tongrentang has celebrated its 320th anniversary. At a small commemorative meeting held today, a congratulatory message from Premier Li Peng was read: Traditional Chinese medicine benefits the people, and Tongrentang has a long history.

Tongrentang is located in Dazhalan outside Qianmen in Beijing and was established in the eighth year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty (1669 AD). It is said that its founder, Le Zunyu, came from a family of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. He had served as a clerk in the Qing imperial archives, enjoyed reading medical texts, and was skilled in identifying medicinal herbs. He collected a large number of imperial secret formulas, ancient formulas, unique formulas, folk remedies, and ancestral secret formulas, and established Tongrentang to produce and sell patent medicines. Due to its remarkable efficacy, Tongrentang gained a widespread reputation and was favored by both the common people and the imperial court. During the Yongzheng reign, it obtained the privilege of supplying medicines to the imperial pharmacy, effectively becoming the imperial pharmacy of the Qing court at that time. To this day, the Palace Museum still preserves two pills of the Wuji Baifeng Pill that Empress Dowager Cixi did not finish, bearing the seal of Tongrentang from the Guangxu reign.

The ancient Tongrentang used to operate with a store in the front and a factory in the back. After the founding of New China, its appearance changed. The reform and opening-up policy decided by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China enabled Tongrentang to reach new heights. Now, it has been divided into six pharmaceutical factories according to production specifications. In addition to the original old store, a wholesale building has been newly constructed, and two sales outlets have been established in coastal open cities through joint ventures. At the same time, joint-venture packaging plants have been established in inland and coastal areas to meet the demand for Tongrentang medicines from a wide range of users.

The "old brand" Tongrentang is now full of vigor. It combines traditional processing and manufacturing methods with modern scientific technology, adding strength like a tiger. In 1988, its output value exceeded that of 1948 by 683 times. The traditional ten famous medicines have also seen new developments. Currently, Tongrentang medicines are not only sold nationwide but are also exported to Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Singapore, the United States, Canada, Switzerland, France, Italy, and dozens of other countries, with export volume ranking first in the industry nationwide.

To maintain its reputation and prestige, Tongrentang also solemnly declared on the 20th that Tongrentang formulas have never been leaked, and Tongrentang technology has never been disclosed. Various "Tongrentang" establishments have no connection with Beijing Tongrentang.

　　同仁堂：320岁
　　本报记者　颜世贵
    久负盛名的同仁堂，迎来了开业320周年。在今天举行的小型纪念会上，宣读了李鹏总理为此写来的贺词：中医药造福人民，同仁堂源远流长。
    同仁堂坐落在京华前门外大栅栏，创建于清康熙八年（公元1669年）。据介绍，其创始人乐尊育出身中医世家，曾任清宫文书档案吏目，喜阅方书，善辨药味，收集了大量宫廷秘方、古方、绝方、民间验方和祖传秘方，创办了同仁堂制售成药。由于药效显著，声誉远播，深受百姓欢迎，亦博得皇宫之青睐。在雍正年间，取得了向御药房供药的特权，以后实际上成了当时清朝宫廷的御药房。至今故宫博物院还保存着两丸慈禧当年未吃完的乌鸡白凤丸，上面有光绪年同仁堂制作的印记。
    古老的同仁堂，过去是前店后厂，新中国成立后，面貌有了改观。党的十一届三中全会确定的改革开放的政策，使得同仁堂更上一层楼。现在，已按生产剂型分工为六个药厂。除原有老店外，又新建了批发大楼，并在沿海开放城市，合资设立了两个销售窗口；同时还在内地和沿海，合资创办了分装厂，以满足广大用户对同仁堂药品的需求。
    “老字号”的同仁堂，如今青春焕发，它把传统的加工制做方法和现代科学技术融合起来，如虎添翼。1988年产值已超过解放前1948年的683倍。传统的十大名药也有了新的发展。目前，同仁堂的药品不仅行销全国各地，还远销港澳地区以及日本、新加坡、美国、加拿大、瑞士、法国、意大利等数十个国家，出口额居全国同行业之首。
    为保持自己的信誉和威望，同仁堂20日还郑重声明：同仁堂处方从未外传，同仁堂工艺更无泄漏，各地“同仁堂”与北京同仁堂无任何渊源关系。
