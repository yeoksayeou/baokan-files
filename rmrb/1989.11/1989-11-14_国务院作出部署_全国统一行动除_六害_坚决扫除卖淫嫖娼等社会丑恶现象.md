The State Council has issued directives for a nationwide campaign to eradicate six major social evils. The campaign aims to decisively eliminate prostitution, the production and distribution of obscene materials, the trafficking of women and children, the cultivation, use, and trafficking of drugs, gambling, and the exploitation of superstition for financial gain and harm. This effort is part of the ongoing nationwide "anti-pornography" campaign.

The People's Daily, Beijing, November 13th: Reporter Wu Hengquan reports that to support the ongoing nationwide "anti-pornography" campaign, the State Council held a telephone conference today to deploy a nationwide effort to eradicate prostitution, the production and distribution of obscene materials, the trafficking of women and children, the cultivation, use, and trafficking of drugs, gambling, and the exploitation of superstition for financial gain and harm.

Secretary of the State Council, Luo Gan, presided over the meeting. Wang Fang, State Councilor and Minister of Public Security, spoke on behalf of the State Council.

Wang Fang pointed out that in recent years, despite multiple crackdowns and bans, the six major social evils have not been effectively controlled. They seriously corrupt social morality, disrupt social order, and endanger the physical and mental health of the broad masses, especially young people. The public and various sectors of society have strongly reacted to this. This campaign to eradicate the six major social evils is an important component of implementing the spirit of the Fourth and Fifth Plenums of the Thirteenth Central Committee, an important part of the struggle against bourgeois liberalization, and a crucial task in building socialist spiritual civilization. Therefore, all levels of government and relevant departments must prioritize this work, treat it as a major task at hand, and grasp it firmly.

Wang Fang said that the work to eradicate the six major social evils involves many departments, including public security, procuratorates, courts, judicial administration, civil affairs, health, tourism, propaganda, culture, news and publishing, commerce, customs, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and the All-China Women's Federation. Local governments must organize, deploy, and command in a unified manner. All relevant departments and grassroots units must work together, starting with strengthening ideological education and management, to implement comprehensive governance. Strictly ban illegal and criminal activities related to the six major social evils, and severely punish those who violate criminal laws. Prevent mere formalities.

Wang Fang demanded that the judicial and law enforcement agencies strictly follow the law, pay attention to the policy boundaries, and accurately and firmly strike against illegal and criminal activities. All forms of gambling, inducing, forcing, or harboring women to engage in prostitution, and producing and selling obscene books and pictures are all serious threats to social order. Regardless of whether there is a profit motive, they are all targets for crackdowns.

Vice President of the Supreme People's Court Lin Zhun, Vice Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Feng Jinwen, Vice Minister of Justice Guo Dezhi, and Secretary of the National Women's Federation Guan Tao spoke at the meeting.

    国务院作出部署
    全国统一行动除“六害”
    坚决扫除卖淫嫖娼等社会丑恶现象
    本报北京11月13日讯　记者吴恒权报道：为配合正在全国深入开展的“扫黄”斗争，今天国务院召开电话会议，部署在全国范围内开展扫除卖淫嫖娼、制作贩卖传播淫秽物品、拐卖妇女儿童、私种吸食贩运毒品、聚众赌博和利用封建迷信骗财害人等社会丑恶现象的统一行动。
    国务院秘书长罗干主持了会议，国务委员、公安部长王芳代表国务院讲了话。
    王芳指出，近几年来，卖淫嫖娼等“六害”虽经多次打击和查禁取缔，但发展蔓延的势头仍未得到有效的控制，严重毒化社会风气，扰乱社会治安，危害广大群众特别是青少年的身心健康，广大群众以及社会各界对此反应十分强烈。这次开展的扫除卖淫嫖娼等“六害”的斗争，是贯彻党的十三届四中全会、五中全会精神的一个重要内容，是反对资产阶级自由化斗争的一个重要组成部分，也是加强社会主义精神文明建设的一项重要工作。因此，各级政府和有关部门一定要把这项工作摆上重要议事日程，作为当前的一项重要工作，抓紧抓好。
    王芳说，扫除“六害”的工作，涉及到公安、检察、法院、司法、民政、卫生、旅游、宣传、文化、新闻出版、工商、海关、工会、共青团、妇联等许多部门。各级政府要统一组织、统一部署、统一指挥。各有关部门和基层单位一定要通力合作，从加强思想教育、加强管理入手，实行综合治理。严厉查禁从事“六害”活动的违法犯罪行为，依法从严惩处触犯刑律的犯罪分子，防止走过场。
    王芳要求政法机关严格依法办事，注意掌握政策界限，稳、准、狠地打击违法犯罪分子。凡是赌博，引诱、强迫、容留妇女卖淫，制作、贩卖淫书、淫画的，都属于严重危害社会治安行为，不论其是否有营利目的，都属于打击之列。
    最高人民法院副院长林准、最高人民检察院副检察长冯锦汶、司法部副部长郭德治、全国妇联书记处书记关涛在会上讲了话。
