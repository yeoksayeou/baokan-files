At some point, every township and county-owned unit established its own small cash fund. Whether the accounts were clear or not is another matter, but the unit leaders had real power. When officials from higher up came, they could treat them to a meal; during festivals, they could spend a bit. Over time, these small cash funds became associated with improper practices.

The oil fields of Dongying City in Shandong Province were no exception. Although the township's finance office had little "oil" in its "big pot," sometimes even struggling to pay the salaries of township cadres on time, the "local small treasuries" had plenty of "oil." Where there is oil, there are people who come to "drink the oil" and "wipe the oil." Thus, these small cash funds naturally became bottomless pits.

This year in July, someone reported that there were many problems with the small cash funds. The township's Party Committee and government decided that they could no longer turn a blind eye and made a decisive decision: to cut off the small cash funds of each township-owned unit, seal the accounts, and thoroughly settle the overdue old accounts. They would investigate every problem to the end and not show any mercy. It turned out that the more they investigated, the more they found. Just in the Family Planning Guidance Station, Water Management Station, and other five township-owned units, they uncovered 502,984.8 yuan in funds that did not comply with financial regulations, along with various unreasonable expenses such as IOUs, outstanding bills, and dining receipts. The township finance office quickly established a cleanup team to investigate the sources and uses of funds in each small cash fund. At the same time, township cadres, regardless of the reason, were required to repay all debts by September 15. The decision made on August 18 was put into action the next morning, with someone voluntarily repaying their debt. The first to repay was the township Party Committee Secretary. This spring, an old friend from the Land Management Station borrowed 30 yuan in his name, and he had to repay it; the second to repay was the township head, who had borrowed 400 yuan from a certain unit for his brother-in-law to build a house in the spring, and now it was only natural for him to repay the debt on behalf of his brother-in-law. With the leaders taking the initiative to repay their debts, ordinary cadres, who had initially wanted to wait and see, could no longer sit still and rushed to the township finance office with cash and savings books. By September 15, all 120,000 yuan of personal overdue debts in the entire township had been repaid. Other debts also had clear settlements.

After cutting off the small cash funds, how would the accounts of each township-owned unit be managed? The township had a plan: they set up accounts for units that were previously financially independent in the township finance office, implementing separate accounting, separate use, and unified management. This way, they ensured that funds for each sector were used for their intended purposes and effectively controlled the waste of funds in each township-owned unit. The public commented that no one dared to eat the "Tang Monk's flesh" from each unit, and the "big pot" of the township finance office had more oil.

　　小金库清查记
　　田国新
    不知从何时起，乡镇直属单位都各自建立了一个小金库。帐目清不清且不说，但单位领导有了实权，上边来人餐一顿；过年过节，花用一番。久而久之，这个小金库和不正之风挂上了钩。
    山东省东营市的油郭乡也不例外，虽说该乡财政所这口“大锅”的“油水”不多，有时连乡干部的工资都不能按时发，但那些号称为“地方小财政”的小金库里“油水”却不少。有油，就有人来
  “喝油”、“揩油”。于是，这一个个小金库自然成了填不满的深坑。
    今年7月，有人反映小金库里问题多。该乡党委和政府认为再不能熟视无睹，作出果断决定：砍掉乡直各单位的小金库，查封帐目，彻底清算拖欠的旧帐，对查出的问题一追到底，决不手软。真是不查不知道，一查吓一跳。仅计划生育指导站、水利管理站等5个乡直单位就查出不合乎财务制度的款项502984.8元，借条、欠条、吃喝条等不合理开支一一被曝光。乡财政所很快成立清理小组，查清各个小金库支出和收入的来龙去脉；同时，乡干部不论何因何故，一律在9月15日前全部还清。8月18日作出的决定，8月19日早晨就有人主动还款了。第一个还欠款的是乡党委书记。今年春天，他的一个老乡从土地管理站借了30元钱，钱是以他的名义借的，帐得他还；第二个还款的是乡长，他内弟今春盖房子急需钱，他从某单位借了400元，现在替内弟还款理所当然。领导带头还欠款，一般干部原想看看形势再说，现在也坐不住了，纷纷拿着现金和存折往乡财政所里跑。到9月15日，全乡12万元的个人拖欠款已全部还清。其它款项也都笔笔有着落。
    砍掉小金库后，各乡直单位的往来帐目怎么办？乡里自有打算：他们把原来财务独立的单位分别在乡财政所设了户头，实行单独记帐，分别使用，统一管理的方式，全部实行一支笔审批制度。这样既保证了各口资金的专款专用，又有效地控制了各乡直属单位的资金浪费。群众反映，各单位的“唐僧肉”没人敢吃了，乡财政所这口“大锅”的油也多了。
