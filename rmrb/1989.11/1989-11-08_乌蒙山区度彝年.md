The first day of the tenth lunar month, the deep interior of the Wumeng Mountains in Hezhang County, Guizhou Province, was immersed in a festive atmosphere. Simi people from all directions, along with Han, Miao, Hui, and Buyi ethnic minorities, gathered in the mountain city, singing and dancing, celebrating the annual Simi New Year together.

The city was adorned with vibrant costumes, smiling faces, sweet and rough melodies, and light, joyful dance moves, making the county seat exceptionally beautiful.

An Yiqiu, the president of the Guizhou Simi Studies Association, who specially came from Guiyang to celebrate the festival, told the reporter about the origin of the Simi New Year. He said that in the past, the Simi ancestors, according to their own invented solar calendar, divided a year into 10 months, each with 36 days, leaving 5 days for the New Year. Later, as they integrated with the Han people's lunar calendar, they gradually set the first day of the tenth lunar month as the most solemn and grand ethnic festival of the Simi people.

The Simi people love to dance, and during this festive season, their enthusiasm for dancing is even greater. From the early morning of the New Year, Simi people and other ethnic minorities in the Wumeng Mountains set up dance stages by the mountains and rivers. The city of Hezhang County, located at the junction of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, was particularly lively. A performance of the "Lingdang Dance" vividly presented the long history of changes in the Simi people. The Wumeng Mountain Simi Dance, improved on the basis of Simi folk dances, vividly reflects the light, joyful, and enthusiastic characteristics of the Wumeng Mountain ethnic groups in its music and dance rhythms, with a strong sense of the new era.

The Simi cuisine is also delightful. During meals, according to Simi traditions, wine jars with multiple tubes are placed on the table. Simi people and guests from other ethnic groups gather around the jar, repeatedly sipping the rice wine from the tubes. A sip is sweet and sour; a taste is refreshing and long-lasting. Only when the guests are drunk, a team of open-minded Simi girls will open their throats and sing the "Drinking Song" over and over again: "Once a year is the new year, once a year is the harvest. Friends from afar, light wine is not enough to express our respect. Please drink, friends. One cup for friendship, two cups for longevity, three cups for a bountiful harvest. Drink, friends!"

After drinking, they start eating. Simi New Year's meal is not luxurious, but the way of eating is very particular. Buckwheat cakes should be bitten vertically, steamed potatoes should be licked, barley fried noodles should be mixed with yellow wine, tofu and green vegetables should be dipped in chili water, each with its own tricks. Especially the "Bagua Chicken," which is particularly elaborate. A whole steamed white chicken is divided into two legs, two wings, two breasts, and two backs, totaling eight pieces, symbolizing the eight trigrams. The chicken head is offered to the most precious guest or the most respected elder at the table. After the chicken head is eaten, the 42 bones of the head are arranged in order, and divination is performed based on the condition of the bones from various parts, telling fortunes.

During the feast, Miao, Hui, Han, and Buyi guests all expressed their gratitude to the hospitable Simi hosts in their own languages or songs. Wei Anli, the deputy director of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of Qianxinan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, sang impromptu: "Thank you, dear friends, thank you for the wine, I will take the deep friendship back home."

The night in the mountain city reached a new climax. At night, two bonfires were lit in the central square of the county seat, turning the night sky red; 480 torches gathered from all around the county seat, like flying dragons. Tens of thousands of brothers and sisters from various ethnic groups danced the torch collective dance hand in hand on the square and by the bonfires, singing joyfully.

    乌蒙山区度彝年
    新华社记者　王满　刘子富
    农历十月初一，地处乌蒙山区深处的贵州省赫章县沉浸在一片欢腾之中。来自四面八方的彝族同胞和汉、苗、回、布依等兄弟民族同胞欢聚山城，载歌载舞，共庆一年一度的彝族年。
    五彩缤纷的盛装，绽满笑意的脸蛋，甜美、粗犷的歌声，轻盈、欢快的舞姿，把县城装扮得格外漂亮。
    特意从贵阳赶来欢度佳节的贵州省彝学研究会会长安毅夫向记者讲述了彝族年的来历。他说，从前彝族祖先按照自己发明的太阳历，将一年分为10个月，每月36天，剩5天留作过年。以后，随着与汉民族天文历法的融合，逐步选定农历十月初一为彝族最隆重盛大的民族节日。
    彝族善舞，适逢佳节更增添了舞兴。从大年一清早开始，彝族和各兄弟民族同胞在乌蒙山区的山旁水畔纷纷摆开了舞场。地处川、滇、黔交汇处的赫章县城更是热闹非凡。一台“铃当舞”将彝族古老漫长的历史变迁集中具体地展现在人们面前。在彝族民间舞蹈基础上改进的乌蒙山彝族舞，从音乐的旋律、舞蹈的节奏，都酣畅淋漓地体现出轻松、欢快、热烈的乌蒙山区民族特色，具有强烈的新时代感。
    彝族的饮食，同样令人赏心悦目。进餐时，按彝家的传统习惯，在席间摆放着插有多支管子的酒坛，彝家和各族客人先要围聚坛前，反复从管里吸饮米酒。喝一口，甜中带酸；咂一下，清爽味长。直到客人酒酣之时，那一队队落落大方的彝家姑娘，放开歌喉，一遍又一遍唱着《敬酒歌》：“一年一度的新年，一年一度的丰收。远方来的客人，淡酒不成敬意。请喝吧，朋友。一杯联友谊，二杯祝长寿，三杯庆丰收。喝吧，朋友！”
    酒后进食。彝族的年饭不讲奢华，吃法却十分讲究。荞粑粑要竖着咬，蒸土豆要舔着吃，燕麦炒面须用黄酒拌，豆腐青菜要蘸辣椒水，各有各的招数。特别是八卦鸡，尤为讲究。清蒸白鸡分解为两腿、两翅、两脯和两背，共八块，象征八卦。鸡头献给一桌之中最珍贵的客人或最有名望的长辈。鸡头啃完后，要将头部的42块骨头依次排列起来，从各个部位骨头的吻合状况，占卜吉祥，说出道道。
    席间，苗、回、汉、布依等族客人都用各自的语言或歌声，向热情好客的彝族主人表达谢意。黔西南布依族苗族自治州民委副主任韦安礼即兴唱道：“谢谢亲人，谢谢美酒，我将把深情厚谊带回家。”
    山城的良宵，节日的气氛又达到一个新的高潮。入夜，在县城中心广场上点燃的两堆熊熊篝火，把夜空映得通红；480束火把从县城四周汇集而来，似条条火龙翻飞。上万名各族兄弟姐妹在广场上、在篝火旁，一边手拉手跳着火把集体舞，一边放声欢快地歌唱。
