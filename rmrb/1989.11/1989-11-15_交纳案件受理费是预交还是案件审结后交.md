    Question: Should case acceptance fees be paid before or after the case is adjudicated?
    Answer: Case acceptance fees should be prepaid. The principle is that the party who files the lawsuit should prepay. The amount of case acceptance fees to be prepaid should be determined according to the standards set by the Supreme People's Court. The amount of other litigation fees to be prepaid should be decided by the People's Court based on the specific circumstances of the case. After the People's Court decides to accept a case, it should notify the parties to prepay the case acceptance fees within 7 days, or the plaintiff should prepay the case acceptance fees within 7 days from the date of receiving the notification from the People's Court. In counterclaim cases, the counterclaiming party should prepay the case acceptance fees at the same time as submitting the counterclaim statement. If there are difficulties in prepayment, an application for deferred payment can be made to the People's Court within the prepayment period. If the parties do not prepay the case acceptance fees within the prepayment period and do not apply for deferred payment, the case will be treated as voluntarily withdrawn.

    For appeal cases, the appellant should prepay the litigation fees to the People's Court when submitting the appeal statement. If both the plaintiff and the defendant appeal, both parties should prepay separately. If the appellant does not prepay the litigation fees within the appeal period, the People's Court should notify them to do so. If the appellant does not prepay within 7 days after the notification and does not apply for deferred payment, the appeal will be treated as voluntarily withdrawn. For enforcement application fees and other similar fees, the applicant should prepay when making the application.

    If the People's Court finds that a case it has accepted is not within its jurisdiction and transfers it to the relevant court with jurisdiction, the original accepting court should transfer the prepaid case acceptance fees along with the case to the receiving court.

    In the trial of economic disputes, if it is found that the case involves criminal offenses, the case should be transferred to the criminal court for trial. The prepaid case acceptance fees should be refunded; if the economic dispute still needs to be continued after the criminal part is transferred, the prepaid case acceptance fees will not be refunded.

    For cases where the lawsuit is suspended, the prepaid case acceptance fees will not be refunded. After the reason for the suspension is removed and the lawsuit is resumed, no additional case acceptance fees will be required.

    If the lawsuit is terminated due to the death of one party, making it impossible or meaningless to continue the lawsuit procedure, the lawsuit procedure will be terminated. For terminated cases, the prepaid case acceptance fees will not be refunded.

    For cases remanded for retrial by the second-instance People's Court, the prepaid case acceptance fees for the appeal will not be refunded. If there is a subsequent appeal after the retrial, no additional case acceptance fees will be required.

### 交纳案件受理费是预交还是案件审结后交

    交纳案件受理费是预交还是案件审结后交
    问：案件受理费是先交纳还是案件审结后交纳？
    答：案件受理费应当先行预交，原则是谁告状谁预交。案件受理费预交多少，按最高人民法院规定的标准办理。其他诉讼费预交多少，由人民法院根据案件的具体情况决定。人民法院决定受理当事人的案件后，应当告知当事人在7日内预交案件受理费，或者原告自接到人民法院预交案件受理费的通知次日起7日内预交。反诉案件，由反诉当事人在提交反诉状的同时，预交案件受理费。预交确有困难的，在预交期限内可向人民法院申请缓交。当事人在预交期限内没有预交案件受理费，又不提出缓交申请的，按自动撤回起诉处理。
    上诉案件的诉讼费用，由上诉人向人民法院提交上诉状时预交。原告和被告都提出上诉的，由双方分别预交。上诉人在上诉期内未预交诉讼费的，人民法院应当通知其预交。在人民法院通知后7日内仍未预交，又未提出缓交申请的，“按自动撤回上诉处理”。申请执行等费用由申请人在提出申请时预交。
    人民法院发现受理的案件不属自己管辖而移送有关管辖权的人民法院审理，原受理的人民法院应将预收的案件受理费，随案移交接受案件的法院。
    审理经济纠纷案件中，发现本案属于刑事犯罪，案件移送刑事审判庭审理。预交的案件受理费予以退还；如果案件的刑事部分移送后，经济纠纷仍需继续审理的，预交的案件受理费不予退还。
    中止诉讼的案件，预交的案件受理费不予退还。中止诉讼的原因消除后，恢复诉讼时，不再预交案件受理费。
    诉讼终结，是由于一方当事人死亡而出现的特殊情况，使诉讼程序的继续成为不可能或者失去了意义，从而结束诉讼程序。终结诉讼的案件，预交的案件受理费不予退还。
    第二审人民法院发回重审的案件，预交的上诉案件受理费不予退还。重审后再上诉的，不再预交案件受理费。
