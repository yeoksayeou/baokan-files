Thailand Strives to Eradicate the Roots of Drugs

By Li Aicheng, Xinhua News Agency

The opium poppies and drugs produced in the mountainous regions of northern Thailand and along its borders with Laos and Myanmar not only harm many Thai people but are also illegally trafficked to various parts of the world. The Thai government has long prioritized the fight against drugs, focusing on eradicating the roots of the problem within its own borders.

As early as 1976, the Thai government established an anti-drug committee led by a deputy prime minister, headquartered in Bangkok, with anti-drug centers in various locations and over 600 staff members. Recently, General Chawalit Yommanee, the secretary-general of the anti-drug committee, spoke to a reporter about the government's measures in the fight against drugs.

The anti-drug committee, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, has been conducting anti-drug education in primary schools and using mass media for anti-drug propaganda. Committee members regularly visit grassroots communities to educate the public about the dangers of drugs and relevant laws. The government has granted the anti-drug committee the authority to arrest drug traffickers. It also actively mobilizes the public to report drug-related activities, rewarding informants. The anti-drug committee has repeatedly destroyed drug factories, arrested criminals, and confiscated drugs. In just the past year, it apprehended 54,464 criminals and seized over 360 tons of heroin and other drugs.

To help drug addicts reform, the government has established 133 rehabilitation centers, treating approximately 50,000 people annually. The reporter visited the Tanyarad Hospital in the northern part of Bangkok. This hospital specializes in treating drug addicts, with around 8,000 inpatient treatments and 10,000 outpatient treatments each year. The hospital director pointed to a few people walking and chatting in the courtyard and said to the reporter, "Today is the day for family visits. These patients used to cause family turmoil and financial ruin due to drug addiction. Now they come here for treatment and receive support and encouragement from their families and friends. Look how affectionate they are." In a spacious reception hall, a group of young patients was singing a song they composed for their families: "In despair, we came here, and we found new life..."

Traditional opium poppy cultivation areas in Thailand are concentrated in the northern regions where minority ethnic groups reside. Since 1972, the government has implemented a plan to replace opium poppy cultivation with agricultural and other economic crops in these regions. The government patiently educates the cultivators, helping them understand the benefits of switching to agricultural crops. Simultaneously, the government has established agricultural research centers in the area to cultivate high-yield economic crops suitable for the region, providing seeds and seedlings for free; it also offers loans, fertilizers, and farming tools, and helps them find markets for their products. For those who refuse to comply and persist in their actions, the government forcibly destroys the opium poppies. Through these measures, the area of opium poppy cultivation nationwide has significantly decreased. In 1988, it was nearly halved compared to 1985.

　　泰国努力铲除毒根
　　本报记者　刘爱成
    泰国北部山区及其与老挝、缅甸交界处种植和生产的罂粟花、毒品，不仅使许多泰国人深受其害，并且非法运往世界各地。泰国政府多年来重视反毒斗争，并把重点放在本国境内铲除毒根。
    早在1976年，泰国政府就成立了由一名副总理领导的肃毒委员会，总部在曼谷，在一些地方设立肃毒中心，共有600多工作人员。肃毒委员会秘书长差瓦利·育玛尼警少将不久前接受了记者的采访，介绍了政府在肃毒方面所采取的措施。
    肃毒委员会在教育部的配合下，从小学就开始进行反毒品教育，通过大众传播媒介进行反毒品宣传。工作人员定期深入基层，向群众讲解毒品的危害性以及有关法令。政府授予肃毒委员会逮捕贩毒分子的权力。它还积极发动群众，奖励举报者。肃毒委员会多次摧毁毒品工厂，逮捕罪犯，销毁毒品。仅去年就捕捉犯罪分子54464人，没收海洛因等各种毒品360多吨。
    为了使吸毒者改过自新，政府建立了133个吸毒者医疗中心，每年接受治疗的约有5万多人。记者访问了位于曼谷市北部的坦亚叻医院。该医院专门治疗吸毒者，每年住院治疗的吸毒者约8000多人次，门诊治疗的有1万人次。医院负责人指着院内三三两两正在散步和聊天的人对记者说，“今天是家属看望患者的日子。过去这些患者因为吸毒常常弄得倾家荡产，闹得全家鸡犬不宁。现在他们来到这里接受治疗，受到家人亲朋的支持和鼓励，您看他们多么亲热”。在一所宽大的接待室里，一群青年患者正在为家属们演唱他们自己谱写的歌曲：“在绝望中来到这里，我们获得了新生……”
    泰国传统的罂粟花种植区集中于北部少数民族居住区。从1972年开始，政府在该地区实行以种植农产品及其他经济作物代替罂粟花的计划。政府耐心教育种植者，使他们认识到改种农作物的好处。同时，政府还在当地建立农业科研中心，培育适合于该地种植的经济效益高的农作物，免费提供种子和幼苗；还提供贷款、肥料及农具，为他们寻找产品市场等等。对于不听劝告、屡教不改者，则强行砍掉罂粟花。通过这些措施，目前全国罂粟花的种植面积已大大减少，1988年比1985年减少了将近一半。（附图片）
