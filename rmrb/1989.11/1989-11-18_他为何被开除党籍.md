Li Yongchun, the secretary of Jianggezhuang Township Government in our county, issued 291 marriage registration certificates for young people in the township from January 1988 to May 1989. Among these, 92 certificates were issued to couples who did not meet the legal marriage age, accounting for 31.6% of the total registrations. This seriously violated the marriage laws and had a very negative impact on the public. For this reason, Li Yongchun was expelled from the Party.

    他为何被开除党籍
    我县姜各庄镇政府秘书李永春，在1988年1月至1989年5月间，共为乡镇青年办理结婚登记证291份，其中，不足法定结婚年龄的就有92份，占登记总数的31.6％，严重地违反了婚姻法规，在群众中造成了很坏的影响。为此，李永春受到开除党籍的处分。
