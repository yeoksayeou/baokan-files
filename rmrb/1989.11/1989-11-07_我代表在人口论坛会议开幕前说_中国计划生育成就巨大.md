The "Population Forum for the 21st Century," co-sponsored by the United Nations Population Fund and the Dutch government, opened in Amsterdam on November 6. Representatives from over 80 countries and several international organizations gathered to discuss global population issues.

Péng Péiyún, the head of China's State Family Planning Commission, spoke to a reporter from our newspaper before the conference. She said that since the 1970s, China's achievements in implementing population policies have not only benefited social development and improved people's lives but have also, to a certain extent, eased the pressure of global population growth. The Chinese government's experience in this area involves integrating population issues into the overall strategy of socio-economic development.

Péng Péiyún stated that population issues are both domestic and global. Each country formulates and implements its own population policies based on its national conditions. At the same time, population issues affect global economic development and the future of humanity. Developing and developed countries need to cooperate and jointly address these challenges. China hopes to strengthen this cooperation.

She added that the United Nations Population Fund, as the world's largest multilateral population aid agency, has a responsibility to contribute to controlling population growth and improving population quality through bilateral and multilateral cooperation. It has already played an increasingly important role in international population activities. The Chinese government will continue to support and cooperate with its operations.

According to United Nations statistics, the world's population has already reached 5.2 billion. Without effective control measures, it is projected to reach 9.5 billion by 2025. In this severe situation, all countries should cooperate effectively and formulate clear strategic guidelines.

The main purpose of this conference is to discuss specific measures and suggestions for controlling rapid population growth.

This world population forum is held on the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations Fund. It will last for four days. The executive director of the United Nations Population Fund, Ms. Shadiq, said to reporters on the evening of the 5th that she hopes the conference will formulate specific plans to help solve the world's population problems. She highly evaluates China's population policy, believing that China has made great contributions to controlling global population growth.

    我代表在人口论坛会议开幕前说
    中国计划生育成就巨大
    本报阿姆斯特丹十一月六日电　记者魏崴报道：由联合国人口基金和荷兰政府联合举办的“二十一世纪人口论坛”会议六日于阿姆斯特丹开幕。包括中国在内的八十多个国家和一些国际组织的代表，就世界人口问题交换意见。
    出席这次会议的中国国家计划生育委员会主任彭珮云会前对本报记者说，从七十年代以来，中国在执行人口政策方面所取得的成就，不仅有利于社会的发展和人民生活的改善，而且在一定程度上缓解了世界人口增长的势头。中国政府这方面的经验，是将人口问题纳入整个社会经济发展的战略中统筹解决。
    彭珮云说，人口问题，既是个内政问题，各国皆从自己的国情出发，制订和执行自己的人口政策；同时它又是一个世界性问题，影响到全球经济发展和人类的前途，发展中国家和发达国家需要相互合作，共同解决之。中国希望加强这种合作。
    她还说，联合国世界人口基金作为世界上最大的多边人口援助机构，有责任为控制人口增长，提高人口素质，开展双边和多边合作作出贡献，而且它已经在国际人口活动中发挥着日益重要的作用。中国政府将一如既往，对它的业务活动给予合作和支持。
    据联合国统计，目前世界人口已达五十二亿，如不采取有效控制措施，到二零二五年将达九十五亿。在这种严峻形势下，世界各国应开展有效合作，制订出较明确的战略方针。
    此次会议的主要宗旨，就是为控制人口增长过快探讨具体的办法及建议。
    本次世界人口论坛会议是在联合国基金成立二十周年之际召开的，为期四天。联合国人口基金执行主任沙迪克女士五日晚对记者说，她希望会议能制订出有助于解决世界人口问题的具体方案。她对中国人口政策评价甚高，认为中国为控制世界人口增长作出了很大贡献。
