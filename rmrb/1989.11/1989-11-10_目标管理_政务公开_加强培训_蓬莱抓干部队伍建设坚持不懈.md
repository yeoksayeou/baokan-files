Penglai, known as the "Penglai Paradise," has been persistently focusing on building a strong cadre team, ensuring that cadres at all levels become leaders trusted by the people.

The county committee has implemented a target management responsibility system to enhance the sense of duty and responsibility among cadres. The committee has divided the county's spiritual and material civilization construction into ten major tasks, breaking them down into 1,176 specific items and targets. These are then assigned to relevant county departments, townships, and individual cadres, with responsibility contracts signed for each. Based on periodic inspections and assessments, rewards, punishments, and promotions are determined.

The county has also implemented administrative transparency, willingly accepting public supervision. Since 1987, Penglai County has gradually made public six key areas of concern to the people: housing allocation, recruitment, conversion from agricultural to non-agricultural status, cadre selection, promotion, and appointment, cadre performance evaluations, and financial, audit, tax, and credit matters. Building on this, last year in the first half of the year, issues related to electricity allocation, construction bidding and contracting, environmental protection, measurement, various fees, distribution of agricultural materials, and rural housing land allocation were all made public.

The county has strengthened the training of grassroots cadres to improve their political and professional skills. The county committee has treated the training of rural grassroots cadres as a major task. Preliminary statistics show that since 1986, the county has trained 19,000 cadres.

The county has used the methods of "returning from outside" and "dispatching" to strengthen grassroots leadership teams. Addressing the issue of some village party branches and village committees being "weak" or "empty" teams, Penglai County has invited capable individuals who are skilled in management and have influence among the people to return from outside the village to take on major roles in the village, leading the people to prosperity together. For economically backward units where there are no suitable candidates for the position of party secretary within the village, they have selected outstanding party members from county and township-level government agencies, enterprises, and institutions to go and take up positions.

The county has strengthened the study of basic theories among cadres to improve their level of Marxism-Leninism. The county committee has organized theoretical study classes and party building seminars to study the works of Marx, Lenin, Mao Zedong, and relevant party documents and the party constitution.

    目标管理　政务公开　加强培训
    蓬莱抓干部队伍建设坚持不懈
    据新华社北京11月9日电  （通讯员郝志学、记者李择红）以“蓬莱仙境”闻名的山东省蓬莱县，坚持不懈地抓干部队伍建设，使各级干部成为群众信得过的带头人。
    实行目标管理责任制，增强干部的事业心、责任感。县委把全县精神文明和物质文明建设划为十大任务，并分解成1176项具体工作和目标，然后逐一落实到县直有关部门、各乡镇和干部个人，签署目标管理责任状。根据定期检查考核结果，奖罚和选拔使用干部。
    实行政务公开，自觉接受群众监督。自1987年以来，蓬莱县委在群众关心的“热点”、敏感问题上逐步实现“六公开”：分房公开；招工公开；“农转非”公开；干部的选拔、升降、聘用公开；干部政绩考核公开；财政、审计、税务、信贷公开。在此基础上，去年上半年，又对用电分配、建筑业招标承包、环保、计量、各种收费、农用物资分配、农村宅基地划分等问题，全部公开。
    加强基层干部队伍培训，提高干部政治、业务素质。县委把搞好农村基层干部的培训工作当成一件大事来抓。据初步统计，自1986年以来，全县培训干部达1.9万人次。
    采用“外返”和“下派”办法，充实基层领导班子。针对有些农村党支部、村委会实际是“弱班子”、“虚班子”的状况，蓬莱县把本村一些会经营、善管理、在群众中又有一定威信的在外从事各种经营活动的能人请回来，让他们在村里担任主要职务，带领群众共同致富。对一些经济比较落后，支部书记在本村又确无人选的单位，他们从县、乡镇级机关、企事业单位选派优秀党员干部下去挂职。
    加强干部基本理论学习，提高干部马列主义水平。县委采用举办理论学习班及党的建设研讨班等形式，把干部组织起来学习马列、毛泽东著作及党的有关文件及党章等。
