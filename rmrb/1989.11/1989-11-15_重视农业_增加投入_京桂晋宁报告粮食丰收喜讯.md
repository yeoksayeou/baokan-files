Xinhua News Agency, Beijing,

According to Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics, the city's total grain production this year is expected to reach 24.75 million metric tons, an increase of 5.5% over last year. This marks the 11th consecutive year of stable grain production growth in Beijing.

Beijing's suburbs are characterized by limited land and a large population, with an average of less than 1.2 mu of arable land per person. The region is also responsible for supplying a variety of subsidiary food products to the capital. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, Beijing has focused on subsidiary food production while ensuring grain production. The Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the municipal government believe that grain production is the foundation for the development of livestock, subsidiary food production, and township enterprises in the suburbs. Without grain production, nothing can be achieved. Under this guidance, Beijing has taken several measures to promote grain production:

First, strengthen leadership in grain production and actively guide farmers to grow grain.

Second, prioritize investment in agriculture.

Third, rely on science and technology to continuously increase grain production.

Fourth, in regions with suitable conditions, promote appropriate scale management tailored to local conditions.

The various levels of party and government leaders in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have firmly established the idea that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. They have united to focus on grain production, achieving a bumper harvest this year despite severe drought.

According to the autonomous region government's forecast, the total grain production for the region is expected to reach 12.5 billion kilograms, an increase of 2 billion kilograms over last year.

Guangxi suffered a significant grain reduction of over 1.6 billion kilograms due to natural disasters last year, which put immense pressure on the entire region. This experience has made the leaders of Guangxi keenly aware that grain, as a special commodity, must never be neglected. Since the fourth quarter of last year, the entire region has prioritized grain production in its economic work. The top leaders at various levels have personally overseen agricultural and grain production. More than 60,000 officials have been dispatched from the regional, municipal, county, and township governments to form production and disaster relief teams and summer harvest teams, providing long-term assistance at the grassroots level.

After the bumper harvest, the masses of farmers have voluntarily sold grain to the state. By the end of October, the region had already stored 8.6 billion kilograms of grain, completing 90.5% of the annual grain storage task.

Shanxi Province has seen a comprehensive increase in its main agricultural products, including grain, cotton, fruits, meat, eggs, and fish. Among these, the total grain production, cotton yield per mu, and farmers' per capita net income have all surpassed the province's historical highs.

Statistics from relevant departments in Shanxi indicate that the province's total grain production this year reached 8.791 billion kilograms, a 7.4% increase over last year; the total cotton production was 95 million kilograms, a 9.2% increase over last year, with an average cotton yield of 53 kilograms per mu. The per capita net income of the province's 20 million farmers is expected to exceed 500 yuan for the first time.

The strong leadership of various levels of government and the close cooperation of agricultural departments are the main factors behind Shanxi's agricultural success. Ensuring stable planting areas for grain and cotton is another key factor in achieving a bumper harvest.

At the same time, Shanxi Province has taken measures to promote agricultural technology, which has had a significant effect on increasing production.

People's Daily, Yinchuan,

The total grain production in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region this year reached 1.765 million metric tons, a 7% increase over the bumper harvest year of 1988, setting a new historical record.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, due to the popularity of reform and opening-up policies, the people of Ningxia have broken free from the long-term reliance on state-subsidized grain. For several consecutive years, they have enjoyed self-sufficiency. This year, Ningxia experienced favorable weather conditions, which were conducive to agriculture. A large number of scientific and technological personnel went to the countryside to implement contract farming, creating high-yield fields and improving scientific farming practices. Farmers have significantly increased their investment in agriculture, which are several important factors contributing to the new record in grain production. Particularly noteworthy is that the southern mountainous region of Ningxia, one of the poorest areas in the country, saw a grain production increase of over 15% this year.

    重视农业　增加投入
    京桂晋宁报告粮食丰收喜讯
    北京
    据新华社北京电　（记者苏会志）据北京市统计局预计，今年北京市粮食总产量可达247.5万吨，比去年增产5.5％。至此，北京市粮食生产已连续11年稳步增产。
    北京郊区地少人多，人均耕地不足1.2亩，又担负着为首都提供多种副食品的任务。党的十一届三中全会以来，北京市在狠抓副食品生产的同时，坚持不放松粮食生产。北京市委、市政府领导认为，粮食生产是郊区发展畜牧业、副食品生产、乡镇企业的基础，不发展粮食生产则一事无成。在这种思想指导下，北京市在几方面采取措施，促进粮食生产：
    一是加强对发展粮食生产的领导，积极引导农民种粮。
    二是重视对农业的投入。
    三是依靠科技促粮食不断增产。
    四是在条件具备的地区，因地制宜推进适度规模经营。
    广西
    据新华社南宁电 （记者赖玉章）广西壮族自治区各级党政领导牢固树立农业是国民经济基础的思想，上下齐心抓粮食生产，今年大旱之年夺得粮食丰收。
    据自治区政府预测，全区粮食总产量可达125亿公斤，比去年增产20亿公斤。
    广西去年因灾粮食减产16亿多公斤，这给全自治区带来很大压力。这一教训，使广西各级领导深切体会到粮食这个特殊商品，任何时候都不能放松。因此，从去年第四季度起，全自治区上下都把粮食生产摆在经济工作的首位，各级党政第一把手亲自抓农业，抓粮食生产，并从区、地、县、市、乡机关中抽调出6万多名干部，先后组成生产救灾工作组和三夏工作组，长期深入基层协助工作。
    粮食丰收后，广大农民群众自觉向国家交售粮食。截至10月底，全自治区已入库的粮食达8.6亿多公斤，占全年粮食入库任务的90.5％。
    山西
    据新华社太原电　（记者李仁虎　鄯宝红）山西省粮、棉、果、肉、蛋、鱼等主要农产品全面增产。其中，粮食总产量、棉花亩产量和农民人均纯收入三项指标均超过这个省的历史最高水平。
    来自山西有关部门的统计数字表明，今年全省粮食总产量达87.91亿公斤，比上年增长7.4％；棉花总产量0.95亿公斤，比上年增长9.2％，棉花平均亩产量达53公斤；全省2000万农民的人均年纯收入可第一次超过500元。
    各级政府加强对农业的领导和涉农部门的密切配合，是山西农业丰收的主要因素。保证粮食、棉花播种面积的稳定是获得丰收的又一因素。
    同时，山西省采取措施促进科技兴农，起到了明显的增产作用。
    宁夏
    本报银川电  宁夏回族自治区今年粮食总产量达176.5万吨，比大丰收的1988年增长7％，创历史最高纪录。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，由于改革开放政策深得民心，宁夏人民摆脱长期吃国家返销粮的历史，至今连续好几年了。今年，宁夏风调雨顺，气候宜农；大批科技人员下乡搞承包，创亩产吨粮田，提高了科学种田水平；农民对农业大量增加投入等，这些是粮食生产创新纪录的几个重要因素。尤其令人高兴的是，全国最贫困地区之一的宁夏南部山区，今年粮食总产量比去年增长15％以上。
