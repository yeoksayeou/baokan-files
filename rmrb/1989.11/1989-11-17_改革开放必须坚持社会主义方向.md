Jiang Zemin comrade's speech at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China mentioned several important issues that need special attention in the current work of the Party and the state, with the first being the issue of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and the unity of reform and opening up. The unity of the Four Cardinal Principles, which are the foundation of the state, and reform and opening up, which is the path to a strong nation, is key and core to adhering to the socialist direction of reform and opening up. This means adhering to the socialist path, adhering to people's democratic dictatorship, adhering to the leadership of the Communist Party, and adhering to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in reform and opening up. It is a reform and opening up that adheres to the socialist system's self-improvement, not a reform and opening up that adheres to the bourgeois liberalization stance, advocating for China's "complete Westernization," which is in stark contrast to the Four Cardinal Principles. The latter so-called "reform and opening up" is capitalist in nature, aiming to integrate China into the Western capitalist system. Currently, the sharp contrast between the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization is largely reflected in the question of whether reform and opening up should adhere to the socialist direction. Therefore, it is undoubtedly of practical significance to study why reform and opening up must adhere to the socialist direction and how to adhere to the socialist direction in reform and opening up.

I. Two Completely Different Stances on "Reform and Opening Up" and Their Different Consequences

Reform and opening up are important components of the line and policies formulated by the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, and an indispensable part of the basic line of the Party in the primary stage of socialism. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, it is precisely because the policy of reform and opening up has been implemented that China's economic strength has significantly improved, economic vitality has greatly increased, people's lives have undergone remarkable changes, and the basic needs of the vast majority of the people have been met, beginning to move towards a moderately prosperous society. The construction of socialist democracy and the rule of law has also achieved remarkable results. In the main aspects of national and social life, there are already basic laws to follow, democratic atmosphere is unprecedentedly active, citizens' awareness of participating in politics has greatly increased, and the system of people's congresses and the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation led by the Party have made significant progress. All of these are evident to all and are recognized by domestic and international public opinion. Reform and opening up have been wholeheartedly supported by the broad masses.

Reform and opening up has been able to create a new situation for China's socialist cause because it is organically united with the adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles, adhering to the socialist direction. If this direction is abandoned, and "reform and opening up" is carried out according to the model imagined by foreign hostile forces and domestic advocates of liberalization, China's socialist cause will not only fail to achieve the aforementioned achievements, but the socialist positions already gained will be lost, and the achievements of socialist construction over the past 40 years will be destroyed. China will not only have no hope of revitalization but will fall into serious internal turmoil and historical retrogression. The political turmoil that occurred in China this spring and summer, and the historical experiences of other socialist countries, have all sounded the alarm for us.

The occurrence of this political turmoil in China is undoubtedly rooted in deep international and domestic backgrounds, but why, after ten years of reform and opening up, when the broad masses have already felt the correctness of the line and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee from their own experiences, so many people were incited by a small number of stubborn advocates of bourgeois liberalization and political conspirators to participate in the turmoil and even the rebellion, this is a question worth pondering. An important reason is that the broad masses have a justified dissatisfaction with the increasingly serious corruption in the Party and the government, the unfair distribution in society, and the severe inflation, while a small number of instigators of the turmoil and rebellion have taken advantage of this dissatisfaction.

What is worth deep reflection is why these phenomena that cause strong dissatisfaction and extreme disgust among the broad masses have been able to grow and spread, and why they have not been effectively solved for so long. Are they the result of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, or are they the product of separating and opposing reform and opening up from the Four Cardinal Principles? The way to solve these problems is to adhere to the socialist direction of reform and opening up, or to take the path of "complete Westernization"? Obviously, the correct answer can only be one, that is, these phenomena have precisely grown and spread because they have deviated from the unity of reform and opening up with the adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles, and the result of solving the problem can only be to adhere to the socialist direction of reform and opening up.

Take the spread of corruption as an example. This is not the result of the liberalization advocates' propaganda that the Communist Party has become corrupt, nor is it the result of their propaganda that corruption is due to the implementation of public ownership and the leadership of the Party. In fact, there are corrupt elements within the Communist Party, but any fair-minded person will admit that the Communist Party as a whole is good and is the most honest in Chinese history. Theoretically, public ownership and the nature of the Communist Party are diametrically opposed to corrupt behavior, while private ownership and political parties and factions of the exploiting class are inherently linked to corrupt behavior. Because public ownership means that the means of production belong to the public, and in essence, they can only be used to benefit all the people, not as a means for a few people to seek private gain. The Communist Party is the vanguard organization of the proletariat, and its sole purpose is to serve the people. As long as public ownership and the Communist Party do not change their nature, they cannot become the breeding ground for corrupt behavior. In practice, since the founding of the People's Republic of China and the establishment of the socialist system, China has been implementing socialist public ownership under the leadership of the Party, but for a long time, there has not been a phenomenon of corruption spreading. However, in capitalist countries that implement private ownership and multi-party systems, corruption has not only not disappeared but has become widespread, it is just that the media in China did not expose it for a period of time. As long as one makes a rough analysis of the history and reality of ancient and modern China and the world, if one does not have prejudice, one cannot conclude that there is an inherent connection between corruption and public ownership and the leadership of the Party. On the contrary, these phenomena are precisely the products of private ownership and can coexist with political parties and factions of the exploiting class.

Then why has corruption in the Party and the government become increasingly serious in recent years? This is inseparable from Comrade Zhao Ziyang's passive attitude towards adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, seriously neglecting the construction of the Party, spiritual civilization, and ideological and political work. Developing the commodity economy, implementing various forms of ownership and distribution, and expanding economic and technological exchanges with the outside world should prevent the infiltration of bourgeois decadent thoughts and be vigilant against "sugar-coated bullets." As a developing socialist country, the tradition of hard work and simplicity should not be abandoned for decades. But in a recent period, high consumption has been rampant, extravagance and waste have been seen as generous and glorious, and hard work and struggle have been seen as stingy and shameful. This reversal of right and wrong has provided soil for the spread of corruption. And the public opinion of "everything for money," "nitpicking," "calculating," "earning and spending," "justifying individualism," etc., has provided a theoretical basis for corruption. Obviously, the problem is not that the Four Cardinal Principles have been adhered to and the socialist direction has been adhered to, but precisely the result of abandoning the socialist direction.

As for the problem of unfair distribution in society, it is one of the serious problems that have emerged in economic life in recent years. The unfair distribution characterized by excessive income disparities has caused strong dissatisfaction among the broad masses and has seriously dampened the enthusiasm of the vast majority of workers, cadres, and intellectuals. They work hard and selflessly, but their income is not high, while those who have not made significant contributions to the country and society exploit the mistakes and loopholes in our economic work to make huge fortunes. Especially those who make huge profits through illegal activities such as speculation, bribery, embezzlement, theft, smuggling, and private trading, have seriously disrupted the economic order, corrupted social customs, and affected social stability. After ten years of reform, the material benefits of all laborers have indeed improved significantly, and the living conditions of the broad masses have greatly improved compared to ten years ago, but while "eating meat with a bowl in hand," there is a very common phenomenon of "putting down chopsticks and cursing," which is to a large extent related to unfair distribution.

Various unreasonable and excessively unequal income gaps have emerged and developed precisely because of the deviation from the socialist direction in the process of reform and opening up and the implementation of various unreasonable "tilt" policies. For example, in dealing with the relationship between public ownership and non-public ownership, the hands of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises are tied while non-public ownership is pampered, and then it is claimed that in terms of economic efficiency, state-owned enterprises are not as good as collective, collective is not as good as individual, individual is not as good as private, and that public ownership needs to be fundamentally reformed and privatization should be advocated. Again, in the field of distribution, the principle of distribution according to work is denied, and socialist enterprise workers are defined as sellers of labor power, and the existence of exploitation in private enterprises is denied, which naturally cannot correctly understand and handle the problem of unfair distribution. Furthermore, in the relationship between fairness and efficiency, socialism is seen as sacrificing efficiency for fairness, advocating that socialism sacrifices efficiency and has only universal poverty, while capitalism first seeks efficiency but ultimately helps to achieve fairness. In fact, Marx had long ago criticized the Lassallean socialism of "fair distribution" and "equal rights," emphasizing that socialism replacing capitalism is not to achieve some eternal "justice," but precisely to liberate the productive forces. The so-called liberation of the productive forces precisely means to pay attention to the efficiency of economic activities. The aforementioned so-called "theories" have become the basis for some inappropriate "tilt" policies, making it difficult to correct the mistakes in economic work in a timely manner, and on the contrary, because of the "theoretical basis," they are even more difficult to touch.

As for the emergence and development of inflation, it is also inseparable from the uncritical adoption of Western economic theories. For a period of time, the theory of "consumption stimulating production" was widely propagated, while little attention was paid to the decisive role of production, resulting in high consumption becoming rampant. When people criticized this approach as not in line with national conditions, some people cited the fact that there are still millions of people in China who are not well-fed to argue that there is no high consumption and overconsumption. This cannot but cause the consumption fund to expand rapidly, exacerbating the contradiction of total demand exceeding total supply. When inflation has already emerged and needs to be curbed, the opinions of "deficit is harmless," "inflation is beneficial," and "balanced budget is a small producer mentality" have become widespread. Marxist theories of reproduction and proportional distribution have been thrown aside, or infatuated with the market economy theory that as long as prices are liberalized, the market mechanism will automatically coordinate the supply-demand ratio, denying the necessity of classified price management and the policy of stabilizing prices.

All of these prove that it is precisely because there is a tendency in the process of reform and opening up to deny the socialist direction, advocating unconditional imitation of the West, and copying the capitalist economic model, values, and lifestyle, that various phenomena that cause public dissatisfaction have spread, and have not been corrected for a long time. The existence of this tendency is also inseparable from Comrade Zhao Ziyang's erroneous guiding ideology that what is the socialist road, no one can explain now, so it can be mentioned less or not mentioned at all. The facts show that there are indeed two completely different propositions on the issue of reform and opening up. The reason why the reform and opening up over the past ten years have been able to promote the rapid development of China's socialist cause is that the line and policies proposed by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping are correct. At the same time, due to Comrade Zhao Ziyang's erroneous deviation from the correct stance of the Central Committee when he was in charge of work, adapting to the needs of those who advocate liberalization, making reform and opening up not always consistent with the adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles, some unnecessary mistakes have been made, causing the development and intensification of contradictions within the people. This clearly tells us that we must distinguish between the two fundamentally opposed propositions of reform and opening up and firmly grasp the socialist direction of reform and opening up.

II. The Essence and Purpose of Reform and Opening Up is to Perfect the Socialist System

Those who stubbornly adhere to the stance of bourgeois liberalization and engage in political conspiracies are attempting to make China "completely Westernized" under the banner of "reform and opening up." When they cooperate with Western reactionary forces in the strategy of "peaceful evolution," create public opinion, distort facts, and deceive the public, an important tactic is to denigrate those who advocate the unity of the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up as "conservatives," opposing "reform," and to elevate Comrade Zhao Ziyang, who does not advocate adhering to the socialist direction of reform and opening up, as the representative of the "reformers." This kind of public opinion has had a certain misleading effect on some young people who are enthusiastic about reform and opening up but lack political experience and analytical ability. This tells us from the opposite side that when implementing reform and opening up, we must correctly understand the essence and purpose of reform and opening up.

The policy of reform and opening up was proposed after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, summarizing the historical experience of socialist construction since the founding of the country and also summarizing the historical experience of other socialist countries. Reform and opening up has become a policy that must be adhered to in the construction of socialism, not because socialism, as a new social system, has some inherent and insurmountable defects that must be fundamentally transformed, but because the socialist system itself is a system that develops and improves on its own basis. It needs to consciously adjust the parts of the production relations that are not suitable for the production forces according to the actual level of social productive forces and the objective requirements for further development, and adjust the parts of the superstructure that are not suitable for the economic base. This is what we call socialist reform. Socialism is not a system isolated from the world, nor is it a closed system. Socialist countries are members of the world economic system and need to and should develop economic and technological relations with all countries in the world, learning from others' strengths and making up for our own weaknesses. Therefore, we must emphasize opening up to the outside world, and the essence and purpose of reform and opening up is precisely to perfect and develop the socialist system, not to retreat to capitalism. Therefore, adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and the socialist direction is originally an indispensable part of what we call reform and opening up. A true, not a quotation-marked, reformer cannot fail to mention the socialist direction. Similarly, being enthusiastic about reform and opening up, not using it as a signboard, and not selling dog meat in sheep's clothing, also cannot fail to ask about the political direction of reform.

To correctly grasp the essence and purpose of reform and opening up, we should acknowledge and emphasize that economic reform cannot take the path of privatization, and political reform cannot take the path of "political pluralism" or "multi-party system." If these paths are taken, it is not a socialist reform, but a retreat to capitalism.

"Privatization" or its variant "privatization" was once in vogue, seemingly becoming the direction of reform. Daring to cut into public ownership seemed to be the dividing line between "reform" and "conservatism." Public ownership is the economic foundation of socialism. If reform means "privatization," the economic foundation of socialism is subverted, then how can we talk about the socialist direction, and how can we become the perfection and development of socialism?

Those who advocate liberalization advocate "privatization" and want to create a "middle class," that is, the bourgeoisie in China, on what basis? It is said that only in this way can China be revitalized. The evidence they put forward is nothing more than two points: one is that developed countries and newly industrialized countries and regions in the world have all developed because they have implemented private ownership, while countries with public ownership have not developed as well as those with private ownership; the other is that only private ownership can be efficient, while public ownership means that no one cares about the development of the economy. These two so-called "arguments" have once captivated some young people, but in fact, they cannot stand scrutiny.

First of all, from the perspective of the history and reality of world development, is public ownership doomed to be inferior to private ownership? This argument, if it can be established, cannot be proven by individual cases. Social phenomena are extremely complex, as the saying goes, the world is vast, and there is no strange thing. If one uses individual cases or isolated materials as evidence, any absurd argument can be established. This point was pointed out by Lenin long ago. He pointed out that in social life, one can always find any number of examples or isolated materials to prove any argument. To scientifically analyze problems, when using facts to prove a certain theory, one should not only use some examples or isolated materials, but should generalize from a large number of universal phenomena, or in other words, analyze problems from a broad range and a long process. And if this method is used to analyze problems, to prove that only privatization can promote economic development, one must provide such materials, that is, all or at least most of the countries that have taken the path of privatization have developed faster than public ownership economies. But such materials do not exist in our real world, because after World War II, most of the newly independent developing countries have taken the path of privatization, while only China and a few other countries have taken the path of public ownership. And although these countries have faced imperialist military aggression and Western world blockade and embargo after their revolutionary victories, their economic development achievements are far superior to most developing countries with private ownership from an overall perspective. This is proven by China's 40-year development history. As Comrade Jiang Zemin said, our economic development and the improvement of people's living standards are not only significant compared to China's past history but also do not pale in comparison to many other countries. This at least shows that the idea that only privatization can develop the economy and revitalize China is groundless.

In the current world, economically developed countries are indeed countries that have implemented private systems. But this also needs to be analyzed. Here there are two situations, one is the old capitalist countries that have experienced several hundred years or at least more than 100 years of capitalist development history, and the other is some newly industrialized countries and regions similar to the so-called "four little dragons."

Regarding old capitalist countries, their economic development has a relatively long history, and their economic development to a large extent is achieved by plundering and exploiting the world. Not only in the period when imperialism was rampant, they relied on dividing the world to plunder a large amount of wealth from colonies, semi-colonies, and dependent countries, using backward countries as their capital export sites, sources of raw materials, and sales markets to get rich and prosper, but even today, they still rely on their economic and technological advantages, unequal exchange, debt relations, transnational corporations, and monopolistic organizations to continue exploiting the underdeveloped countries of the world. After World War II, the gap between the North and the South has not narrowed but widened. It is precisely for this reason that establishing a new international economic order and changing the current unreasonable international economic relations has become a common demand of all developing countries, and they are fighting tirelessly for this. Existing socialist countries usually have a low or medium level of capitalist development when they achieve revolutionary victories. In terms of economic and technological levels, they are far behind old capitalist countries. Starting from different starting lines, even with the help of the superiority of socialist public ownership, it is impossible to catch up with developed countries that have several hundred years of development history in a few decades. This is obvious. Some people think that Japan and China had similar levels of economic development after World War II, but after several decades, the gap has widened significantly. Here, let's not talk about the fact that Japan's economic development benefited from the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and we spent a lot of manpower and material resources in these two wars, as well as the fact that China was subjected to Western countries' blockade and embargo while Japan received large amounts of Western loans; even if we look at the level of economic development, this method of comparison that only uses the level of production at that time without considering the historical development foundation is itself unscientific. During the War of Resistance against Japan, why did China have to fight a protracted war against Japan? Was it not because the enemy was strong and we were weak? Japan's productive forces were destroyed by the war, but its capital, technology, and talent were still there, and its foundation was much better than ours. China and Japan are not comparable. If we want to make a scientific comparison, we should look at our comprehensive national strength under public ownership compared to the old China, and whether the gap with old capitalist countries has widened or narrowed. If we observe the problem in this way, the superiority of public ownership over private ownership is very clear. It is the same China, why was the old China without any status in the world, being bullied by others, while today it has become a member of the big triangle? This is not a clear explanation of the problem?

Regarding some newly industrialized countries and regions, they also need to be analyzed specifically. Their development often has unique advantages. Of course, there are also some experiences worth learning and drawing from. But to draw a general conclusion based on these cases, claiming that privatization is superior to public ownership, is not scientific.

It should also be seen that all capitalist countries based on private ownership have economic and social contradictions that they cannot overcome, and their development process is not smooth. The Great Depression of the 1930s is still a terrifying topic in the capitalist world today, is this not the result of capitalist private ownership? Those who advocate privatization are fond of talking about the mistakes of socialist countries, but rarely analyze the greater mistakes and deeper contradictions in the history of capitalist development, this cannot be considered a scientific attitude. From the perspective of historical development, the first century of capitalist development, its mistakes and problems were much greater than those of socialism. The two world wars were both started by capitalist countries, causing unprecedented disasters to humanity. Not to mention that from the perspective of the entire history of social development, socialism as a new system has not been born in the world for very long, its potential has not been fully exploited, and its bright future is not something that short-sighted politicians can understand.

Finally, it should be pointed out that the development of capitalism also has its own stages. China is building industrialization and modernization on a basis of extremely backward economy and culture. If it takes the path of private ownership, it can only be the path of primitive accumulation of capitalism, and China does not have the historical conditions for capitalist primitive accumulation like Europe, America, and Japan in the past. If it takes the path of privatization, it will not only be a path that plunges the broad masses into heavy disasters, but it will also be difficult to develop in today's world of such fierce competition, and the result can only be to become a vassal of Western capitalism, making the people of all ethnic groups in China once again become slaves of international capital and the domestic exploiting class. This is something that the Chinese people will absolutely not agree to.

As for the theoretical basis of privatization, it is even more untenable. The so-called private ownership will be more efficient, the basic basis is that only when the means of production become private property, will people care about its correct use and appreciation. While public ownership makes the means of production ownerless property, people all want to benefit from it but no one cares about its use and appreciation. If this argument can be established, it should be said that individual small private ownership is the most effective system for promoting economic development. Because only in the case of individual small private ownership, the means of production truly belong to individuals. But under the conditions of capitalist private ownership, the vast majority of laborers have already lost the means of production and become wage slaves who sell their labor power. However, the historical fact is that individual small private ownership has precisely been destroyed by capitalist private ownership, making it an economic appendage of capitalism. The more socialized production is, the less the means of production can be individually owned and privately owned, this is a fact of economic history. Even capitalist ownership, its realization form has gradually deviated from the classical form of individual capitalist ownership, developing stock companies, monopolistic organizations, and state monopolies, and the family color of monopolistic organizations has gradually faded. The idea that only private ownership has economic dynamism and vitality has long been refuted by Marx and Engels. Marx and Engels, in the Communist Manifesto, criticized the bourgeois scholars' clichés that the abolition of private property would lead to the extinction of society due to laziness, pointing out that if this were the case, bourgeois society should have been extinguished due to laziness long ago, because the vast majority of people in this society have long been deprived of private property and have become proletarians who have nothing but labor power. In fact, people engage in economic activities, not only with property constraints, but also with other economic constraints. Under private ownership, laborers who have lost the means of production are forced to work by the stick discipline or the discipline of hunger, not because they have private property (means of production). Today, in capitalist enterprises, especially in some large enterprises, the leaders who engage in production and operation are often not the owners of the enterprises, but managers hired by the board of directors. They are not concerned about the correct use and appreciation of the means of production because the enterprise is their private property, but because of other economic and non-economic motives. For the hired workers in these enterprises, they are not working because the enterprise is their property.

Of course, the existing problems of public ownership, such as the "iron rice bowl," some workers lacking a sense of ownership, enterprises bearing profits but not losses, and low economic efficiency, these indeed need to be improved through reform. That is to say, improving the efficiency of the socialist economy should be explored from the experience of practice to find a form of realization of public ownership that can develop the superiority of socialism, not looking back to privatization that has been discarded by China's historical development.

Regarding the issue of "multi-party system" and "political pluralism," this is the model of political system reform proposed by those who advocate liberalization. In their view, political system reform can only imitate the multi-party system and separation of powers of the West, this is democratic politics. Their main reasons are nothing more than two points: one is that with the development of various forms of ownership and commodity economy, economic pluralism has emerged, different classes, strata, groups, departments, and regions have different economic interests, and correspondingly, there is a demand for different political parties and factions in politics. This is said to be the economic basis for the multi-party system in socialist reform. The other is that only by implementing the multi-party system can there be a relationship of mutual restraint among powers, while the one-party rule of the Communist Party has no power restraint, is not supervised, and absolute power necessarily leads to dictatorship and corruption, etc. These reasons are untenable.

Here, it should be explained that the so-called "multi-party system" and "political pluralism" do not refer to whether socialist countries allow the existence of political parties and factions other than the Communist Party, because in the eyes of those who propose these ideas, the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system led by the Communist Party in China does not mean the implementation of the multi-party system. The true meaning of the multi-party system is that different political parties can take turns in power through elections and do not recognize the leadership of the Communist Party. Therefore, the first reason does not fully prove the necessity of the aforementioned meaning of the multi-party system, because the pluralism of interests can only indicate that there should be political forces, parties, or groups representing different interests, but it does not necessarily mean that these different political forces, parties, and groups must take turns in power. Whether the pluralism of interests requires the multi-party system to take turns in power involves the essential difference between socialist modernization and capitalist modernization, and it is necessary to carefully analyze this.

Capitalist society is a society based on private ownership, and private ownership determines that private interests are paramount. There are complex contradictions between various private interests, and there is no and cannot be a common social interest that stands above various interests. There, if someone advocates social interests and national interests, the essence is nothing more than to pass off the interests of the ruling class as the interests of the whole society. Therefore, the different political parties and factions formed by the pluralism of interests in capitalist society can adjust the contradictions of interests through the implementation of the multi-party system. Of course, the so-called multi-party system, in essence, is still the one-party system of the bourgeoisie. Because the real controllers of capitalist countries are still the bourgeoisie, the various different bourgeois parties only represent the interests of different classes, groups, and factions within the bourgeoisie. Socialism is a social system based on public ownership. Although there are pluralistic interest relationships under the socialist system, the overall interests and social interests produced by public ownership are the basis for the realization and development of various local interests. Therefore, socialist modernization construction requires, on the premise of maintaining the social interests as the fundamental interests of the whole nation, to coordinate various interest contradictions, so that they can be considered together and each can get what they deserve. Therefore, we must advocate that immediate interests serve long-term interests, local interests serve overall interests, and individual and collective interests serve national interests. This requires the party leading the socialist modernization construction to not only represent a kind of interest relationship, but to represent the common interests and fundamental interests of the whole people. This also determines that it is incompatible with the multi-party system taking turns in power. Because if each party represents the common interests and fundamental interests of the whole people, there is no problem of different parties. And if each party only represents a certain local interest, it will inevitably make local interests prevail over national interests if it comes to power, which is not conducive to the coordination of various interest relationships under socialism, cannot overcome but only exacerbate the contradictions of pluralistic interest relationships, and is not conducive to the development of the cause of socialist modernization. The party that can truly represent the common interests and fundamental interests of the whole people can only be the Communist Party, which is the vanguard of the working class, this is determined by the historical position, historical mission of the working class, and the nature and purpose of the Communist Party.

As for the relationship of mutual restraint among powers, any power, if not supervised and restrained, indeed has the possibility of turning into dictatorship and corruption. But the democratic politics required by the mutual restraint of powers does not have only the form of multi-party system and separation of powers. The core of solving the relationship of mutual restraint of powers is to prevent the dictatorship of a few people and to prevent the use of power to seek private interests for a few people. The latter is not something that the multi-party system can effectively solve. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, it can realize the supervision of the Party through various forms, such as the National People's Congress, democratic parties, mass organizations, mass supervision, and a sound democratic life within the Party. How to improve the procedures and systems of democratic supervision is a problem that needs to be explored in political system reform, but this does not mean to negate the leading position of the Party.

In summary, reform as the perfection and development of the socialist system can only explore forward along the socialist direction, not to follow the outdated capitalist model, to Westernize completely, and to retreat to the path of capitalism.

III. Rectification and Deepening of Reform

The policy of rectification and deepening of reform is the correct guiding policy for economic work proposed by the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee last year according to the current political and economic situation. This policy has been approved by the National People's Congress. During the discussion of Premier Li Peng's government work report at the NPC, there were only two votes against and four abstentions, indicating that the absolute majority of representatives support the policy proposed by the Central Committee. However, since this policy was proposed, there have been people both domestically and internationally who have been creating public opinion and spreading rumors, separating and opposing rectification and deepening of reform, advocating that rectification and deepening of reform is a "counterattack and reversal" of reform and opening up, a "return to the old system," a "conservative" "victory," and a "reformer" "defeat." Some people even claim that rectification and deepening of reform will inevitably lead to economic "stagnation" and "slump," advocating that "the return of the old system" is more terrifying than inflation. On the surface, it seems that these public opinions are all in support of deepening reform, but in fact, the creators of these public opinions not only distort the facts but also, apart from shouting for deepening reform, have not proposed any specific plans for deepening reform under the socialist direction, and if there were such plans, they would only be to privatize and implement the multi-party system, which is fundamentally opposed to the reform policy proposed by our Party and government. Therefore, those who fiercely attack the policy of rectification and deepening of reform are actually not truly concerned about China's progress in reform under the socialist direction, but are using the banner of "reform" to attract some young people who are inexperienced in the world, have reform enthusiasm, but do not understand the laws of reform, and lead them astray.

What is rectification and deepening of reform, why is it necessary to carry out rectification and deepening of reform, and what is the relationship between rectification and deepening of reform? These are questions that must be clarified.

Rectification refers to rectifying the economic environment, and its specific content is to compress social demand, curb inflation, and alleviate the contradiction of total demand exceeding total supply. Deepening refers to rectifying the economic order, and its specific content is to rectify the various chaotic phenomena in the current economic life, especially in the circulation sector, focusing on cleaning up and rectifying the excessive, disorderly, and chaotic companies in circulation, and gradually establishing the order that a planned commodity economy should have. From the connotation of rectification and deepening, this is not a retreat, not a rejection of reform, and even less a return to the old system. On the contrary, it is to create conditions for the deepening of reform and to make reform develop healthily along the socialist direction. At the same time, rectification and deepening is not to completely stop reform and wait until rectification and deepening is done to deepen reform, it itself also needs the cooperation of reform, and some rectification and deepening measures are themselves the content of deepening reform.

Why is it necessary to emphasize rectification and deepening at present? This is determined by the current political and economic situation. In recent years, some prominent contradictions have emerged in China's economic life, such as inflation, unfair distribution, and using power for personal gain, which have caused serious dissatisfaction among the broad masses. The emergence of these problems is, on the one hand, related to the rampant liberalization that has confused people's minds, and on the other hand, it is also related to the mistakes in economic work, such as the direct cause of inflation is the over-allocation of national income and the total demand exceeding total supply, while demand inflation is manifested in both investment inflation and consumption inflation. The former is the scale of construction exceeding national strength, failing to follow the principle of acting in accordance with one's ability and leaving room for maneuver. Investment inflation further exacerbates consumption inflation under today's conditions, because 40% of construction investment is converted into consumption. The latter is that the growth of consumption income has exceeded the growth of labor productivity for many years, far exceeding the nature of "settling accounts" for living problems accumulated over many years, and the phenomenon of "premature consumption" and "high consumption" has emerged. The level and composition of consumption have also exceeded national strength. For example, the popularity rate of household appliances is already comparable to that of middle-income developing countries, color film has almost replaced black-and-white photography, and the consumption level of beer and various alcoholic beverages has almost drunk up the newly increased grain for the year. This situation not only seriously affects the momentum of economic development but is also unsustainable. Obviously, if the economic environment is not rectified, the total demand continues to expand, further widening the supply-demand gap, the economy will not only not be able to develop steadily and harmoniously, but it will inevitably lead to major problems. Once the economy encounters major problems, it will not only be an economic problem but will necessarily develop into a serious political and social problem. This will not only talk about further deepening reform but will also make the achievements of reform perish.

Some people think that solving the contradiction of total demand exceeding total supply should not be done by tightening the economic environment, but by increasing supply, and that controlling demand is a temporary solution, while increasing supply is the fundamental solution. Rectification will cause stagflation and slump, and therefore it is not advisable, and it is correct to be concerned and vigilant about economic slump. But from this, it is concluded that the economic environment does not need to be rectified, which does not conform to the actual situation. Abstractly speaking, production determines consumption, and therefore solving the supply-demand contradiction should rely on the development of production. But this is too general a principle. Any economic work policy cannot be based solely on the most general principle but must be determined from the combination of theory and practice. Everything changes with time and conditions, this is a basic viewpoint of Marxism, the soul of dialectics. We need to increase effective supply, but it is impossible to solve the current economic difficulties completely by increasing supply. Because increasing supply, improving productivity, requires a series of material conditions, such as resources, funds, energy, raw materials, equipment, skilled labor, etc., and therefore it is not something that can be effective in a short period of time. While the current supply-demand contradictions that have led to inflation and economic difficulties, the main aspect of the contradiction is precisely the excessive demand, exceeding national strength. Therefore, the main method to alleviate the contradiction, overcome the difficulties, and get out of the predicament is to rectify the economic environment, to press down the excessively high demand, and to tighten our belts for a few years.

Will rectifying the environment lead to economic slump? This needs to be seen if there is a correct policy. If everything is cut without analysis, it is natural that problems may arise. The Party's policy is to distinguish between different situations, to have both pressure and relief, and some things not only do not need to be pressed but also need to be strengthened. In the process of rectification, the structure should be adjusted, short-term products and socially scarce commodities should be increased, and high-efficiency enterprises and high-tech sectors should be supported. For departments that can enhance the momentum of national economic and social development, such as agriculture, energy, transportation, important raw materials, and basic industries and infrastructure, as well as education and science, they should be developed. These belong to the scope of relief. The pressure is on the scale and speed of general processing industries and non-production construction, and those that do not need to be developed or have poor efficiency should be compressed, so that limited funds and resources can be used to increase effective supply in departments and enterprises, and this will not lead to economic slump.

As for the rectification of the economic order, it is also very necessary. As mentioned above, corruption, chaos in the circulation links, and unfair distribution can only be strictly rectified to meet the needs of the masses and to make the wealth created by the hard work of the broad laboring masses truly used for the development of production and the improvement of living standards, rather than falling into the pockets of a few lawless elements.

In summary, only by firmly implementing the policy of rectification and deepening, can a good economic environment be created for the deepening of reform, and the necessary economic order, rules, and organizations for the development of socialist commodity economy can be achieved, so that reform can develop healthily along the socialist direction.

Moreover, rectification and deepening are directly connected with the deepening of reform, because not only does rectification and deepening need the cooperation of reform, but many rectification and deepening measures are also the content of reform. Reform, as the self-improvement and development of the socialist system, is not only a matter of decentralization and profit-sharing, but also a matter of establishing a market order and macro-control that meets the needs of socialist commodity economy. The socialist economic operation mechanism that our reform requires is not the mechanism of capitalist market economy, but a socialist commodity economic operation mechanism that can organically combine planned economy with market regulation. Not only should the commonality of commodity economy be emphasized, but also the characteristics or individuality of socialist commodity economy should be emphasized. Although the degree, method, and scope of their combination need to be constantly adjusted and improved according to the actual situation. For example, during the current period of rectification and deepening, it is necessary to emphasize more the guiding role of the plan, emphasize appropriate concentration, and gradually increase the proportion of fiscal revenue in national income and the proportion of central fiscal revenue in state fiscal revenue, so as to ensure key construction and increase effective supply, enhance the momentum of economic and social development, and make the national economy develop steadily, continuously, and harmoniously. Even in the future when more use of market regulation is needed, it does not mean that the guiding role of the plan can be completely canceled, and the concentration of the state is not needed, becoming the so-called "small government, big society." The relationship between the plan and the market, Comrade Chen Yun has a vivid saying, is the relationship between the "cage" and the "bird," both allowing the bird to fly and not allowing it to fly out of the cage, leading to macroeconomic disorder. The organization of individual enterprises is something that capitalism has already achieved, but the organization of social production is precisely what capitalism cannot completely solve. Socialist economy should make the organization of individual enterprises and the planning of social production unified, both having the vitality and dynamism of enterprises and consciously implementing the planned and proportional development of the national economy on a macro scale, making the macro-economy also have vitality and dynamism. This is how its superiority over capitalism is displayed. Therefore, the measures related to improving and strengthening macro-control of the economy, establishing and improving the market order, rules, and organizations in the process of rectification and deepening, are precisely the requirements of socialist reform. This is not a retreat but a promotion of China's economic reform. Therefore, as Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out, any view and behavior that separates and opposes rectification and deepening from reform is incorrect, and being unenthusiastic about rectification and deepening is being unenthusiastic about reform. The Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee has made a profound exposition of rectification and deepening and reform in theory, and made specific arrangements in work, which is of great significance for ensuring the continuous, stable, and coordinated development of our country's economy.

    改革开放必须坚持社会主义方向
    北京大学校长　吴树青
    江泽民同志在庆祝中华人民共和国成立40周年大会上的讲话中谈到当前党和国家工作中需要特别注意统一认识的若干重要问题时，第一个问题就是关于坚持四项基本原则和坚持改革开放相统一的问题。坚持作为立国之本的四项基本原则同作为强国之路的改革开放的统一，关键和核心就是坚持改革开放的社会主义方向。即必须实行坚持社会主义道路，坚持人民民主专政，坚持共产党的领导，坚持马列主义、毛泽东思想的改革开放，坚持作为社会主义制度自我完善的改革开放，而不能实行坚持资产阶级自由化立场、要求中国“全盘西化”的人所主张的同四项基本原则相割裂、相背离、相对立的“改革开放”。后一种所谓“改革开放”，就是资本主义化，就是把中国纳入西方资本主义体系。当前四项基本原则和资产阶级自由化的尖锐对立，可以说在很大程度上表现在改革开放要不要坚持社会主义方向这个问题上。因此，研究一下改革开放为什么必须坚持社会主义方向，怎样在改革开放中坚持社会主义方向的问题，无疑是具有现实意义的。
    一、两种截然不同的“改革开放”立场及其不同后果
    改革开放是党的十一届三中全会制定的路线方针政策的重要内容，是党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线的不可分割的组成部分。十一届三中全会以来，正是由于实行了改革开放的方针，我国的经济实力有了很大的提高，经济活力有了很大发展，人民生活发生了显著的变化，绝大多数群众的温饱问题得到了解决，开始向小康水平迈进。我国的社会主义民主和法制的建设也获得了显著的成就，在国家和社会生活的主要方面已经基本有法可依，民主空气空前活跃，公民参政议政的意识大为提高，人民代表大会制度和党领导的多党合作与政治协商制度有了不小的进步。所有这些都是有目共睹的，是为国内外公众舆论所公认的。改革开放，得到了广大群众的衷心拥护。
    改革开放所以能够使我国的社会主义事业开创出一个崭新的局面，是因为它同坚持四项基本原则有机地统一在一起，坚持着社会主义的方向。如果背离了这一方向，按照国外敌对势力和国内搞自由化的“精英”们设想的模式实行“改革开放”，我国的社会主义事业不仅不可能取得上述成就，相反地我国已经取得的社会主义阵地，40年来社会主义建设的成果将毁于一旦；中国不仅振兴无望，而且将陷入严重内乱和历史倒退的灾难之中。我国今年春夏之交发生的动乱和反革命暴乱，其他社会主义国家的历史经验，都给我们敲响了警钟。
    我国这场政治风波的出现，固然有其深刻的国际的背景和国内的根源，但为什么在改革开放进行了十年之久，当广大群众已经从切身体验中感受到了十一届三中全会以来路线方针政策的正确性以后，会有这么多群众被极少数顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场，搞政治阴谋的人煽动起来卷入动乱乃至暴乱之中，这是一个值得深思的问题。一个重要的原因是广大群众对党和政府中日趋严重的某些腐败现象，对社会分配不公、对严重的通货膨胀等现象的正当不满，而极少数动乱、暴乱的制造者们则利用了这种不满情绪。
    值得我们深刻反思的是为什么这些引起广大群众强烈不满和极端反感的现象得以滋长起来，并迟迟得不到有效的解决，它们是由于坚持四项基本原则的结果，还是把改革开放同四项基本原则割裂开来和对立起来的产物？解决这些问题的途径是坚持改革开放的社会主义方向，还是走“全盘西化”之路？显然，正确的回答只能是一个，即这些现象的滋生和蔓延，恰恰是因为违背了改革开放必须同坚持四项基本原则相统一，必须坚持社会主义方向的结果，而解决问题的唯一出路也只能是坚持改革开放的社会主义方向。
    拿腐败现象的滋长为例，这绝不是自由化的鼓吹者所宣扬的共产党已经腐败，也不是他们宣扬的腐败是由于实行了公有制和坚持党的领导的结果。事实上，共产党内有腐败现象，但是凡是公正的人都会承认，共产党的总体是好的，是中国历史上最廉洁的。从理论上说，公有制和共产党的性质同腐败行为是截然对立的，而私有制和剥削阶级的政党和政治派别才与腐败行为有内在联系。因为公有制意味着生产资料属于社会公共所有，就其本质来说只能用来为全体人民谋福利，而不能成为少数人谋取私利的手段。共产党是无产阶级的先锋队组织，他的唯一宗旨是为人民服务。公有制和共产党只要不改变其本质，就不能成为滋生腐败行为的温床。从实践上看，中华人民共和国成立并建立起了社会主义制度以来，我国早就在党的领导下实行了社会主义公有制，但在很长时期内却并没有出现腐败行为滋长和泛滥的现象。而在实行私有制和多党制的资本主义国家里，腐败现象不仅没有绝迹，相反地带有普遍性，只是一个时期内我国新闻媒介不予揭露而已。只要对古今中外的历史和现实作一点粗浅的分析，如果不存偏见的话，绝不能得出腐败现象同公有制和党的领导存在什么内在的联系的结论。毋宁说这些现象恰恰是私有制的产物，并同剥削阶级的政党和政治派别是可以相容的。
    那么为什么近几年来我国党和政府中的某些腐败现象日趋严重呢，应当说，这同赵紫阳同志消极对待坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的方针，严重忽视党的建设、精神文明建设和思想政治工作的错误指导思想分不开的。发展商品经济，实行多种所有制形式和多种分配方式，扩大对外经济技术交往，本应防止资产阶级腐朽思想的侵袭，警惕“糖衣炮弹”。作为发展中的社会主义国家，艰苦朴素的传统几十年也不能丢弃。但近一个时期来，高消费甚嚣尘上，视铺张浪费为大方为光荣，看艰苦奋斗为小气为羞耻，这种是非颠倒正好为腐败现象的滋长提供了土壤。而“一切向钱看”、“斤斤计较”、“两两计较”、“能挣会花”、“为个人主义正名”之类的舆论，又为腐败现象提供了理论根据。显然，问题并不在于坚持了四项基本原则，坚持了社会主义方向，而恰恰是背弃社会主义方向的结果。
    至于社会分配不公问题，是近几年来经济生活中出现的严重问题之一。以收入过分悬殊为特征的社会分配不公，已经引起了广大群众的强烈不满，严重挫伤了广大职工、干部、知识分子的积极性。他们辛勤劳动，无私奉献，但收入不高，而那些对国家对社会没有作出多大贡献的社会成员却利用我们经济工作中的失误和漏洞大发横财。特别是那些借助于投机倒把、行贿受贿、贪污盗窃、走私贩私等不法行为牟取暴利的现象，更是严重扰乱了经济秩序，败坏了社会风气，影响了社会安定。十年改革全体劳动者的物质福利确实有了很大的提高，广大群众的衣食住行与十年前相比已经大为改善，但在“端起饭碗吃肉”的同时，却相当普遍地出现了“放下筷子骂娘”的现象，这在很大程度上同社会分配不公有关。　
    各种不合理的、过分悬殊的收入差别所以会产生和发展，同样也是同改革开放过程中偏离社会主义方向，实行了种种不合理的“倾斜”政策分不开的。例如，在关于处理公有制经济同非公有制经济的关系上，捆住国营大中企业的手脚而对非公有制经济百般照顾，然后又借口在经济效益上国营不如集体、集体不如个体、个体不如私营，要从根本上改造公有制，宣扬私有化。又如在分配领域里出现否定按劳分配原则，把社会主义企业的劳动者定性为劳动力商品的出卖者，否认私营企业存在剥削，这自然无法正确认识和处理社会分配不公问题。再如在公平和效率的关系上，把社会主义看作是为了公平而牺牲效率，宣扬社会主义由于牺牲了效率反而没有公平而只有普遍的贫困，而资本主义先要效率却最后有助于实现公平的“理论”。而事实上马克思早就批评了关于“公平的分配”“平等的权利”的拉萨尔式的社会主义，强调指出社会主义取代资本主义不是为实现某种永恒的“正义”，而正是为了解放生产力。所谓解放生产力恰恰意味着要重视经济活动的效率。上述种种所谓的
  “理论”成了某些不恰当的“倾斜”政策的根据，使经济工作中一些失误不仅不能及时得到纠正，相反却因为有了“理论根据”而更加难以触动。
    至于通货膨胀的产生和发展，更是同不加分析地照搬西方经济学的理论分不开的。一个时期内大肆宣扬消费刺激生产的理论，而很少注意到生产的决定作用，从而高消费呼声甚嚣尘上。当人们批评这种提法不符国情时，又有人拿出中国还有多少万人衣食不足来论证根本不存在高消费和超前消费。这不能不使消费基金急剧膨胀，加剧了总需求超过总供给的矛盾。当通货膨胀现象已经抬头应当予以治理时，“赤字无害论”、“通胀有益论”，收支平衡是“小生产观念”之类的舆论又广为流传。马克思主义的再生产理论、按比例分配理论则被抛到一边，或者迷恋于只要放开价格，市场机制就会自行协调供求比例的市场经济理论，否定对价格分类管理的必要性和稳定物价的方针。
    凡此种种都证明，恰恰由于在改革开放中存在着一种否定社会主义方向，主张无条件的效法西方，照搬西方资本主义经济模式、价值观念和生活方式的倾向，才使各种导致群众不满的现象蔓延开来，并且迟迟得不到应有的纠正。而这种倾向的存在，又同赵紫阳同志认为什么是社会主义道路现在谁也讲不清，因而可以不提或少提坚持社会主义的错误指导思想分不开的。事实表明，在改革开放问题上确实存在着两种截然不同的主张。十年来的改革开放所以能够推动我国社会主义事业的迅速发展，是因为党中央和邓小平同志提出的路线和政策是正确的。与此同时由于赵紫阳同志在主持工作时指导思想的错误偏离了中央的正确立场，适应了搞自由化的人的需要，使改革开放没有始终一贯地同坚持四项基本原则相统一，产生了一些不应有的失误，造成了人民内部矛盾的发展与激化。这清楚地告诉我们，必须划清两种根本对立的改革开放的主张，牢固地把握住改革开放的社会主义方向。
    二、改革开放的实质和目的是完善社会主义制度
    顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场和搞政治阴谋的人是在打着“改革开放”的旗号下妄图使中国“全盘西化”的。他们在配合西方反动势力的“和平演变”战略，制造舆论、歪曲真相、造谣惑众时，一个重要的手法就是把坚持四项基本原则同改革开放相统一的同志贬为“保守派”，反对“改革”，而把主张不要坚持改革开放的社会主义方向的赵紫阳同志奉为“改革派”的代表。他们的这种舆论对一些热心改革开放而又缺乏政治经验和分析能力的青年人曾经起过一定的迷惑作用。这从反面告诉我们，在实行改革开放的时候，必须正确地弄清改革开放的实质和目的。
    改革开放的方针是在党的十一届三中全会以后总结建国以来30年社会主义建设的历史经验，同时也总结了其他社会主义国家的历史经验后提出来的。改革开放所以成为建设社会主义必须坚持的方针，并不是因为社会主义作为一种崭新的社会制度有着什么先天的无法克服的弊端，必须予以脱胎换骨的根本改造，而是因为社会主义制度本来就是一种在自身基础上不断发展和完善的制度，它需要根据社会生产力的现实水平和进一步发展的客观要求，自觉调整生产关系中与生产力不相适宜的部分，调整上层建筑中与经济基础不相适应的部分。这就是我们所讲的社会主义改革。社会主义不是与世隔绝的制度，不是自我封闭的体系。社会主义国家是世界经济体系中的一员，需要也应当同世界各国发展经济技术关系，取人之长、补己之短。因此必须强调对外开放，而改革开放的实质和目的正是为了社会主义制度的完善和发展，而绝不是倒退到资本主义去。因此，坚持四项基本原则，坚持社会主义方向，本来是我们所说的改革开放题中应有之义。真正的而不是打引号的改革派，绝不能不讲社会主义方向。同样热心于改革开放而不是把它当作招牌，挂羊头卖狗肉，也绝不能不问改革的政治方向。
    正确把握住改革开放的实质和目的，就应该承认并且强调，经济改革绝不能走私有化的道路，政治改革绝不能走“政治多元化”或“多党制”的道路。如果走上了这样的道路，那就不是社会主义的改革，而成了向资本主义倒退了。
    “私有化”或其变相的说法“民营化”，在一个时期内曾经喧嚣一时，俨然成为改革的方向。敢不敢向公有制开刀，似乎成了“改革”同“保守”的分界线。公有制是社会主义的经济基础，如果改革意味着“私有化”，社会主义的经济基础被颠覆了，又何谈社会主义方向，又怎么能成为社会主义的完善和发展？
    搞自由化的“精英”宣扬要搞“私有化”，要在中国造成一个“中产阶级”即资产阶级，有什么根据呢？据说，只有这样才能振兴中华。他们拿出来的证据无非是两条，一是世界上发达国家与新兴工业化国家和地区都因为实行了私有制，而公有制的国家发展得都不如实行私有制的国家和地区；二是私有制才能有效率，公有制则无人关心经济的发展，这两条所谓的“论据”，曾经俘虏了一些年轻人，但实际上是经不起推敲的。
    首先以世界发展的历史和现实来看，公有制是否注定不及私有制发展得快呢？这个论点如果能够成立，只是借助于个别事例是无法作证的。社会生活现象是极端复杂的，俗话说，天下之大，无奇不有，如果用信手拈来的个别事例作为根据那就什么荒谬的论点都可以成立了，这一点列宁早就有过精辟的说明。他指出，在社会生活中随时都可以找到任何数量的例子或个别的材料来证实任何一个论点。科学地分析问题，如果要用事实来证明某种理论时，不应当只引用一些例子或个别的材料，而应当从大量的普遍的现象中去进行概括，或者说是要从大范围长过程来分析问题。而如果用这种方法来分析问题，要证明只有私有化才能促进经济的发展，必须提供这样的材料，即凡是走上私有化道路的国家，全部或至少大部都比公有制经济发展得快。但是这样的材料在我们现实的世界上是不存在的，因为战后新独立的发展中国家可以说绝大部分走的是私有化道路，而只有中国和其他一些国家走的是公有制的道路，而尽管这些国家取得革命胜利后曾经面对帝国主义的武力侵犯，面对西方世界的封锁禁运，但从总体上看其经济发展的成就却远远高于多数私有制的发展中国家。这一点我国40年发展的历史就是一个雄辩的证明。正如江泽民同志所说的，我们的经济发展和人民生活水平的提高，不仅同我国过去历史相比较为显著，而且同其他许多国家相比也不逊色。这至少可以说明认为只有私有化才能发展经济，振兴中华是没有根据的。
    在目前的世界上，经济发达的国家确实是实行了私有制度的。但这同样要进行分析，这里有两种情况，一种是经历了几百年或至少100多年资本主义发展历史的老牌资本主义国家，一种是类似被称作“四小龙”的一些新兴工业国和地区。
    关于老牌资本主义国家，他们的经济发展有着比较长的历史，并且他们的经济发展在很大程度上是靠掠夺和剥削全世界来实现的。不仅在殖民主义横行时期，他们依靠分割世界从殖民地半殖民和附属国掠夺了大量财富，靠把落后国家作为自己的资本输出场所、原料来源和销售市场来发财致富，而且直到今天仍然依靠其经济和技术上的优势，依靠不等价交换，依靠债务关系，依靠跨国公司和垄断组织继续在剥削着世界不发达国家。二次大战以后，南北之间的差距，不是缩小了，而是扩大了。正因为这样，建立新型的国际经济秩序，改变目前这种不合理的国际经济关系才成为所有发展中国家的共同要求，并正在为此进行不懈的斗争。现有的社会主义国家在革命胜利时，通常都是资本主义不够发达或只有资本主义中等发展程度的国家。在经济和技术的水平上远远低于老牌资本主义国家。在不同起跑线上起步，即使借助于社会主义公有制的优越性，也不可能在几十年的时间内赶上有几百年发展历史的发达国家。这是显而易见的。有些人认为战后日本同中国经济发展程度差不多，但几十年后差距大大拉开了。这里且不说日本经济的发展得益于朝鲜战争和越南战争，而我们在这两次战争中都支出了大量人力物力，以及我国受到西方国家的封锁禁运而日本却得大笔西方贷款；即使从经济发展程度来看，这种只用当时的生产水平而不考虑历史发展的基础的对比方法，本身就是不科学的。在抗日战争期间，为什么我国要同日本打持久战？还不是因为敌强我弱？日本经过战争，生产力受到破坏，但资金、技术、人才还在，基础要比我们好得多。我国同日本不能相比。如果要想科学地进行比较，应该看我们的综合国力在公有制下和旧中国相比，同老牌资本主义国家的差距是进一步扩大了还是缩小了。如果这样来观察问题，公有制比私有制的优越性是十分清楚的。同样是一个中国，为什么旧中国在世界上毫无地位、任人宰割而今天却成为大三角的一员，这不是很清楚地说明了问题吗？
    对于一些新兴工业国家和地区，同样要作具体分析。他们的发展常常有其得天独厚的条件。当然也有一些值得我们学习和借鉴的经验。但仅仅根据这些事例要作出一个一般性的结论，认为私有化优于公有制，则是不科学的。
    还应该看到，所有的建立在私有制基础上的资本主义国家都有他们所无法克服的经济和社会矛盾，并且他们在发展过程中也不是一帆风顺的。30年代的大危机迄今资本主义世界提起来还谈虎色变，这不是资本主义私有制的结果吗？鼓吹私有化的人对社会主义国家的失误津津乐道，却很少去分析资本主义发展历史中的更大失误，更加深刻的矛盾，这绝不能认为是科学的态度。从历史发展来看，资本主义发展的第一个世纪，它的失误和问题要比社会主义大得多。两次世界大战都是资本主义国家发动起来的，给人类造成了空前的灾难。更何况从整个社会发展的历史来看，社会主义作为一种新兴的制度在世界上诞生还不是很久，他的潜力还远远没有发挥，他的远大前程绝不是政治上的短视者所能理解的。
    最后应当指出，资本主义的发展也有其自身的发展阶段。中国是在一个经济文化十分落后的基础上建设工业化和现代化的。如果走上私有制的道路，只能是走上原始积累的资本主义道路，而中国又不具有像欧美和日本当年实行资本主义原始积累的历史条件。如果走私有化的道路，不仅是一条使广大人民陷入沉重灾难之路，而且在当代世界如此激烈的竞争之下，要想发展起来也不容易，其结果只能成为西方资本主义的附庸，使中国各族人民重新沦为国际资本和本国剥削阶级的双重奴隶。这是中国人民所绝对不会同意的。
    至于私有化的理论依据，更是无法成立的。所谓私有制会比公有制更有效率，其基本依据无非是说只有生产资料成为私人财产时，才会有人去关心它的正确运用与增值。而公有制则使生产资料成为无主的财产，人们都想从中捞取好处而谁也不关心它的使用和增值。如果这个论点能够成立的话，应当说个体小私有制是最能促进经济发展的制度。因为只有在个体小私有制的情况下，生产资料才真正归个人所有。而在资本主义私有制条件下，绝大部分劳动者已经丧失了生产资料，成为出卖劳动力的雇佣奴隶。但是，历史的事实是个体小私有制恰恰被资本主义私有制所摧毁，使之成为资本主义的经济附庸。生产越是社会化，生产资料越不能成为个体所有和私人所有，这是经济史的事实。即使资本主义所有制，它的实现形式也越来越摆脱古典的单个资本家所有的形式，发展起了股份公司、垄断组织和国家垄断，垄断组织的家族色彩也越来越淡化。那种认为只有私有制才有经济动力和活力的说法，实际上早被马克思和恩格斯所驳斥过了。马克思和恩格斯在《共产党宣言》中批判资产阶级学者认为消灭了私有财产社会将会因懒惰而灭亡的陈词烂调时指出，如果这样，资产阶级社会早该因为懒惰而灭亡了，因为这个社会里绝大多数人早已被剥夺了私有财产，成为除了劳动力外一无所有的无产者。事实上，人们从事经济活动，并不只有一个财产约束，而且还有其他的经济约束。在私有制下，丧失生产资料的劳动者是靠棍棒纪律或饥饿纪律来促使其劳动的，而不是因为他们有私人财产（生产资料）。今天的资本主义企业里，特别是一些大型企业里，从事生产经营的企业领导人，常常也不是企业的所有者，而是由董事会聘任的经理人员。他们并不是因为企业是自己的私有财产才去关心生产资料的正确运用和增殖，而是有其他的经济和非经济的动机，对于对这些企业中工作的雇佣工人来说，更不是因为企业是自己的财产才去劳动的。
    当然，现存的公有制的弊端，如大锅饭、铁饭碗、一些劳动者缺乏主人翁感；企业负盈不负亏、经济效率不高等，这些确实需要通过改革求得完善。这就是说，提高社会主义经济的效率，应当从总结实践经验中去探索能够发展社会主义优越性的公有制的实现形式而不是向后看，回到已经为中国历史发展所摒弃的私有化去。
    关于“多党制”、“政治多元化”问题，这是搞自由化的人提出的政治体制改革的模式。在他们看来，政治体制改革只有效法西方的多党制和三权分立，这才是民主政治。他们的主要理由无非是两条，一条是随着多种所有制形式和商品经济的发展，经济上出现了利益多元化的倾向，不同阶级、阶层、集团、部门、地区都有各自不同的经济利益，相应地要求在政治上有不同的政治派别和政党。说这是多党制在社会主义改革中有经济基础。另一条是只有实行多党制，才能有权力之间的制约关系，而共产党一党执政没有权力制衡，不受监督，绝对的权力必然产生独裁、腐败，等等。这些理由，是不能成立的。
    这里应当说明，所谓“多党制”和“政治多元化”，不是指在社会主义国家是否允许共产党以外其他政党和政治派别的存在，因为在这些主张的提出者看来，我国实行的共产党领导的多党合作制和政治协商制并不意味着实行多党制。多党制的真实含义，是指不同政党都能通过竞选轮流执政，不承认共产党的领导地位和领导作用。因此，第一条理由实际上并没有充分证明上述含义的多党制的必要性，因为利益的多元化只能说明应当有代表不同利益的政治力量、党派或团体，但并不注定这些不同的政治力量、政党团体非轮流执政不可。利益多元化是否要求多党轮流执政，这涉及社会主义现代化建设同资本主义现代化建设的本质区别问题，有必要认真加以剖析。
    资本主义社会是建立在私有制基础上的社会，私有制决定了私人利益是居于首要地位的。各种私人利益之间存在着错综复杂的矛盾，没有也不可能存在一个凌驾于各种利益之上的社会共同利益。在那里，如果有人宣扬社会利益、国家利益，其实质也无非把占统治地位的阶级的利益冒充为全社会的利益。因此，资本主义社会的利益多元化所形成的不同政治派别和政党，可以通过实行多党制来调节利益矛盾。当然所谓的多党制，就其本质说也还是资产阶级的一党制。因为真正能够支配资本主义国家的还是资产阶级，各种不同的资产阶级政党只是代表了资产阶级内部不同阶层、集团的利益而已。社会主义是建立在公有制基础上的社会制度。尽管社会主义制度下也存在着多元的利益关系，但是公有制所产生的全局利益、社会利益是各种局部利益得以正确实现和发展的基础。因此，社会主义现代化建设要求在维护作为全国人民根本利益的社会利益的前提下，去协调各种利益的矛盾，使之统筹兼顾，各得其所。所以，我们必须提倡眼前利益服从长远利益，局部利益服从整体利益、个人和集体利益服从国家利益。这就要求领导社会主义现代化建设的政党不能仅仅代表一种利益关系，而必须代表全体人民的共同利益和根本利益。这也就决定了它同多党轮流执政是不相容的。因为如果各个政党都是代表全体人民的共同利益和根本利益，就不存在不同政党的问题。而如果各个政党只是代表某种局部利益，由它来执政势必使局部利益凌驾于国家利益之上，这无助于社会主义下各种利益关系的协调，不能克服而只能扩大多元的利益关系的矛盾，因而不利于社会主义现代化事业的发展。而真正能够代表全体人民的共同利益和根本利益的政党，只能是作为工人阶级先锋队的共产党，这是由工人阶级的历史地位、历史使命和共产党的性质和宗旨所决定了的。
    至于从权力的制约关系来看，任何权力如果不受监督和制约，确实有走向独裁和腐化的可能。但民主政治所要求的权力对权力的制约，并不只有多党制、三权分立一种形式。解决权力制约关系的核心，是防止少数人独裁，防止利用权力为少数人牟取私利。后一点并不是多党制所能有效解决的。在共产党的领导下，可以通过多种形式实现对党的监督，如人民代表大会、民主党派、群众团体、群众监督、党内健全的民主生活制度等。如何完善民主监督的程序和制度，是政治体制改革中需要探索的问题，但这不等于要否定党的领导地位。
    总之，改革作为社会主义制度的完善和发展，只能沿着社会主义的方向去向前探索，而不是按照已经过时了的资本主义模式办事，搞“全盘西化”，退回到资本主义的道路上去。
    三、治理整顿和深化改革
    治理整顿深化改革的方针是去年十三届三中全会根据当前政治经济形势提出来的正确的经济工作指导方针。这一方针已经得到全国人民代表大会的批准。在人代会讨论李鹏同志的政府工作报告时，只有两票反对、四票弃权，表明绝对多数的代表都支持中央提出的这一方针。但是，这个方针提出以来，国内外一直有人在制造舆论，散布流言，把治理整顿同改革开放割裂开来和对立起来，宣扬治理整顿就是对改革开放的“反攻倒算”，是“旧体制的复归”，是“保守派”的“得势”，“改革派”的“受挫”。有些人则断言治理整顿必然导致经济“停滞”、“滑坡”，宣扬“旧体制复辟”比通货膨胀更可怕。表面上看，似乎这些舆论都是支持深化改革，但实际上，这些舆论的制造者不仅歪曲了事实，而且他们除了空喊要深化改革以外，也没有提出在社会主义方向下使改革得以深化的具体方案，而如果有这种方案的话，无非是要搞私有化、多党制，这同我们党和政府提出的改革方针是根本对立的。因此，大肆攻击治理整顿方针的人，实际上并不是真正关心中国在社会主义方向下推进改革，而是打着“改革”的招牌以吸引一些涉世未深，有改革热情而不了解改革规律的青年，把他们向斜路上拉。
    什么是治理整顿，为什么要进行治理整顿，它同深化改革究竟是什么关系？这是必须搞清楚的。
    治理是指治理经济环境，它的具体内容是压缩社会需求，抑制通货膨胀，缓解总需求超过总供给的矛盾。整顿是指整顿经济秩序，它的具体内容是整顿目前经济生活中特别是流通领域中各种混乱现象，重点是清理整顿流通中过多过滥过乱的公司，逐步建立起有计划商品经济应有的秩序。从治理整顿的内涵来看，这绝不是倒退，绝不是不要改革，更不是使旧体制复归。恰恰相反，它正是为深化改革并使改革沿着社会主义方向健康发展创造条件。同时，治理整顿也不是完全使改革停顿下来，等治理整顿好了以后再去深化改革，它本身也需要改革的配合，有些治理整顿措施本身就是深化改革的内容。
    为什么目前要强调治理整顿呢？这是由当前的政治经济形势所决定了的。近几年来，我国经济生活中产生了一些突出的矛盾，如通货膨胀、分配不公、以权谋私等，已经引起了广大群众的严重不满，这些问题的产生，一方面是同自由化的泛滥，搞乱了人们的思想有关，另一方面也同经济工作中的失误有关，例如，通货膨胀的直接原因是国民收入的超分配和总需求超过总供给，而需求膨胀既表现为投资膨胀，又表现为消费膨胀。前者是建设规模超过国力，没有贯彻量力而行、留有余地的原则。投资膨胀在今天的条件下本身又加剧着消费膨胀，因为基建投资的40％转化为消费。后者则是消费收入的增长多年来持续地超过劳动生产率的增长，已经远远超出了多年积累下来的生活问题上“还帐”的性质，出现了“超前消费”与“高消费”的现象，消费的水平和构成同样超过了国力。例如家电普及率已相当于中等收入发展中国家水平，彩色胶卷几乎取代黑白照相，啤酒和各种酒类消费水平已几乎将年新增粮食喝光。这种情况显然不仅严重影响了经济发展的后劲，而且也是难以为继的。显然，如果不对经济环境进行治理，总需求继续膨胀，进一步扩大供求缺口，经济不仅不能持续稳定协调发展，而且非出大问题不可。经济一旦出大问题，就绝非经济问题，而必然发展为严重的政治和社会问题，这不仅谈不到进一步深化改革，而且改革成果也必将毁于一旦。
    有人认为，解决总需求超过总供给的矛盾，不应当是靠紧缩治理环境，而是应当增加供给，控制需求是治标，增加供给才是治本。治理将造成滞胀、滑坡，因而不可取，担心和需要警惕经济滑坡，这是正确的。但由此认为不要治理经济环境，就不符合实际情况了。抽象地说，生产决定消费，因而解决供求矛盾应当靠发展生产。但这是过于一般的原理。任何一个经济工作的方针，不能仅从最一般的原理出发，而必须从理论和实际的结合上予以确定。一切依时间、条件为转移，是马克思主义的基本观点，是辩证法的灵魂。我们需要大力增加有效供给，但现实的经济困难要完全靠增加供给解决是不可能的。因为增加供给，提高生产力，需要有一系列物质条件，如资源、资金、能源、原材料、设备、熟练劳动力等等，因而不是短时期内所能奏效的。而目前出现的导致通货膨胀和经济困难的供需矛盾，矛盾的主要方面恰恰在于需求过旺，超过国力。因此，缓解矛盾，克服困难，走出困境的主要方法是治理经济环境，把过高的需求压下来，过几年紧日子。
    治理环境会不会导致经济滑坡？这需要看有没有正确的方针。如果不加分析一切都砍，自然有可能出问题。党的方针是区别对待，有保有压，有的不仅不压，还要强化。要在治理过程中调整结构，增加短线产品、社会紧缺商品，支持效益高的企业和高技术部门，对能使国民经济和社会发展增强起后劲的部门，如农业、能源、交通、重要原材料等基础工业和基础设施，以及教育与科学，要发展。这些属于保的范围。压的是一般加工工业和非生产性建设的规模和速度，把不需要发展或效益差的加以压缩，使有限的资金和资源能用到增加有效供给的部门和企业，这就不会出现经济滑坡。
    至于整顿经济秩序，更是十分必要的。如上所述，腐败现象、流通环节混乱、分配不公等，只有严格整顿才能适应群众的需要，才能使广大劳动群众辛勤劳动创造的财富真正用来发展生产、改善生活，而不致落入少数不法分子的腰包。
    总之，只有坚定不移地贯彻治理整顿的方针，才能为改革的深化创造良好的经济环境，才能有发展社会主义商品经济所必要的经济秩序、规则和组织，才能使改革沿着社会主义方向健康发展。
    不仅如此，治理整顿同深化改革还直接联结在一起，因为不仅治理整顿需要改革的配合，而且许多治理整顿的措施也是改革的内容。改革作为社会主义制度的自我完善和发展，不单是放权让利的问题，同时有一个建立适应社会主义商品经济需要的市场秩序和宏观调控问题。我们改革所要求建立的社会主义经济运行机制，不是资本主义市场经济的机制，而是能把计划经济同市场调节有机结合起来的社会主义商品经济运行机制。不仅要讲商品经济的共性，而且要讲社会主义商品经济的特点或个性。虽然二者结合的程度、方式和范围要经常根据实际情况进行调整和改进。如在当前治理整顿期间，需要更多的强调计划的指导作用，强调适当的集中，逐步提高财政收入在国民收入中的比重和中央财政收入在国家财政收入中的比重，以保证重点建设和增加有效供给，增强经济和社会发展的后劲，使国民经济得以持续、稳定、协调发展。即使将来需要更多利用市场调节时，也不意味着可以完全取消计划的指导，不要国家的集中，变成所谓的“小政府、大社会”。计划和市场的关系，陈云同志有个形象的说法，是“笼子”和“鸟”的关系，既要让鸟能飞起来，又不能飞出笼去，导致宏观失控。个别企业的有组织，是资本主义已经达到的，但社会生产的有组织，恰恰是资本主义所无法完全解决的。社会主义经济要使个别企业的组织性同社会生产的计划性统一起来，既有企业的生机和活力，又要在总体上自觉地实行有计划按比例地发展国民经济，使宏观经济也有生机和活力。这才能显示其对资本主义的优越性。因此，治理整顿过程中有关完善和加强对经济宏观调控，建立和健全市场秩序、规则、组织的措施，正是社会主义改革的要求，这不仅不是倒退，恰恰是推进了我国的经济改革。因此，正如江泽民同志所指出的，任何把治理整顿同改革分割开来，对立起来的观点和行为都是不正确的，对治理整顿不积极就是对改革不积极。十三届五中全会对治理整顿与深化改革，在理论上作了深刻的阐述，在工作上作了具体的部署，这对于保证我们国家的经济持续、稳定、协调发展，具有重大的意义。
