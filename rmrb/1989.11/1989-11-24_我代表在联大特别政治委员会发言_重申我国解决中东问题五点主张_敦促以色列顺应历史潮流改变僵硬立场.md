Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, November 21st.

China's representative, Wang Shijie, today at the UN Special Political Committee's review of reports on Israel's infringement of human rights in the occupied territories, reiterated China's five-point proposal for resolving the Middle East issue.

The five points include: the Middle East issue should be resolved through political means, with no party resorting to force; support for convening an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council and relevant parties; support for appropriate and various forms of dialogue among the relevant parties in the Middle East, including direct dialogue between the PLO and Israel; Israel must stop its repression of Palestinian residents in the occupied territories and withdraw from the occupied Arab lands, while ensuring Israel's security; mutual recognition between the State of Palestine and Israel, and peaceful coexistence between the Arab and Jewish nations.

He pointed out that the PLO and Arab countries have taken a series of flexible and pragmatic policies in this regard, expressing their sincerity in resolving the Middle East issue through political means.

He called on the Israeli authorities to follow the historical trend, change their rigid stance, and adopt a flexible attitude to promote the development of the Middle East peace process.

He said that this year marks the 21st time the UN Special Political Committee has reviewed this issue. Previous sessions of the UN General Assembly and the Security Council have also made corresponding resolutions. Regrettably, all these efforts have not changed Israel's aggressive and expansionist policies. Israel continues to adopt a stubborn attitude, obstructing the resolution of the Middle East issue.

　　我代表在联大特别政治委员会发言
　　重申我国解决中东问题五点主张
　　敦促以色列顺应历史潮流改变僵硬立场
    新华社联合国11月21日电　（记者杨跃华）中国代表王世杰今天在联大特别政治委员会审议有关以色列侵害占领区居民人权行为的报告时，重申中国政府对解决中东问题的5点主张。
    这5点主张包括：中东问题应通过政治途径解决，各方都不诉诸武力；支持召开在联合国主持下、有五个常任理事国和有关各方参加的中东国际和平会议；支持中东有关各方进行合适的、各种形式的对话，包括巴解组织和以色列直接对话；以色列必须停止在占领区对巴勒斯坦居民的镇压，撤出占领的阿拉伯领土，相应地，以色列的安全也应得到保证；巴勒斯坦国和以色列相互承认，阿拉伯民族和犹太民族和平共处。
    他指出，巴勒斯坦解放组织和阿拉伯国家已经在这方面采取了一系列灵活、务实的政策，表达了通过政治途径解决中东问题的诚意。
    他呼吁以色列当局顺应历史潮流，改变其僵硬立场，表现灵活的态度，以利于推动中东和平进程向前发展。
    他说，联大特别政治委员会今年已是第21次审议这一议题。历届联大和安理会也已多次作出相应的决议。令人遗憾的是，这一切都未能使以色列当局改变其侵略、扩张政策，以色列继续采取顽固态度，阻碍中东问题的解决。
