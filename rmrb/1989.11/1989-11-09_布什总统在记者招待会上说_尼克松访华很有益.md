	Bush Says Nixon's Visit to China Beneficial
	People's Daily, Washington, November 7

	Reporter Zhang Qixun reports: President Bush today, at a press conference held at the White House, responded to a reporter's question by saying that former President Nixon's private visit to China was very beneficial. He said that Sino-American relations are important and that steps should be taken to return this relationship to a normalized direction.

	Bush made these remarks after Nixon recently returned from his visit to China. He told reporters that Nixon is an old friend who is respected by China. He is the person who opened up relations with China during a very difficult time, and he sees the importance of this relationship. I also see this importance. He said, "We have huge geopolitical reasons to maintain our relationship with the People's Republic of China. I hope to quietly find steps that both sides can take to return this relationship to a more normalized direction."

	However, when discussing the idea that "the one who tied the bell is the one who should untie it," Bush said he does not think that is the case.

    布什总统在记者招待会上说
    尼克松访华很有益
    本报华盛顿11月7日电  记者张启昕报道：布什总统今天在白宫举行的记者招待会上回答记者的提问时说，尼克松前总统这次私人访华是很有益的。中美关系是重要的，希望找到能够采取的步骤使这种关系回到正常化的方向。
    布什是在尼克松不久前访华回国后说这番话的。他对记者说，尼克松是受中国尊重的一位老朋友，他是在情况非常困难的时刻打开同中国关系的人，他看到这种关系至为重要，我也看到这种重要性。他说，我们有巨大的地缘政治的原因要保持同中华人民共和国的关系。我希望以静悄悄的方式找到或许是双方能够采取的步骤，使这种关系回到更加正常化的方向。但布什在谈到“解铃还需系铃人”这点时，他又说，他认为不是那种情况。
