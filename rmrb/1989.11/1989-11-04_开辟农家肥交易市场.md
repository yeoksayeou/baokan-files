Increasing the use of farmyard manure on cultivated land and rationally adjusting the fertilizer structure have a direct impact on ensuring high and stable agricultural yields. In recent years, there has been an imbalance in the production of farmyard manure in rural areas. Some specialized breeding households have surplus manure from livestock and poultry every year, while general land contract households lack sufficient farmyard manure. Therefore, it is suggested that rural areas should organize and plan the establishment of a market for the trading of farmyard manure, selling various types of livestock and poultry manure to balance the surplus and deficit.

    开辟农家肥交易市场
    耕地增加农家肥用量，合理调整用肥结构，对于保证农业高产稳产有着直接影响。近年来，农村出现了农家肥积造不平衡的情况。一些专业养殖大户，每年家畜垫圈土制肥用不完，而一般的土地承包户，农家肥则不敷使用。为此建议，农村有组织有计划地开辟农家肥交易市场，出售各类畜禽粪便，以引余补缺。
