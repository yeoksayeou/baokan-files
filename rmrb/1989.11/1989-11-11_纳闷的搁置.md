    The total installed capacity of the Huaying Mountain Power Plant is 310,000 kilowatts, with two 55,000-kilowatt units and two 100,000-kilowatt units. After the plant started operation, coal unloading was done using a coal unloading machine, which involved a large amount of work, high labor intensity, significant dust, and slow unloading speed.

    With the approval of the former Southwest Electric Power Administration (now Sichuan Provincial Electric Power Bureau), a coal tippler system was constructed to improve work efficiency and reduce labor intensity. The project was completed in early 1984, and in 1986, it underwent reinforcement. The test run was successful, and the system was ready for operation.

    For unknown reasons, the state-funded project of tens of millions of yuan has been completed for five years but has not been put into operation. Years of exposure to sun and rain have caused some of the equipment to show signs of rust and corrosion. If it is not put into operation soon, it will result in greater waste and loss for the state and the people.

    华蓥山发电厂总装机容量为31万千瓦。装有5.5万千瓦及10万千瓦机组各两台。投产后，锅炉的燃煤一直使用卸煤机，工作量大，劳动强度大，粉尘大，卸煤速度慢。
    经原西南电管局（现四川省电力工业局）同意，修建翻车机系统配套工程，以提高工作效率，减轻劳动强度。1984年初完成此项工程，1986年又进行了加固，试车效果良好，可以投入运行。
    不知是什么原因，国家耗资千万元的工程建成5年之久，至今却不能投入运行，几年日晒雨淋，现在有些设备已出现斑驳、锈蚀。如再不投入运行，将给国家和人民带来更大的浪费和损失。
