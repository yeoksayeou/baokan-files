When money maintains all relationships between people, everyone will feel distressed. However, it is precisely these distressed people who tolerate this social custom and, in turn, exacerbate it, ultimately suffering more and feeling even more distressed.

	It should be said that people's living standards have generally improved. However, human relationships rely on money, and getting things done relies on connections. Lavishness, extravagance, and a dislike for hard work have infiltrated life. Many families have increased their extra expenditures and overspending, and various social obligations are like debts that are hard to avoid, casting a shadow over family life.

	"Debts of Human Relations" — Hard to Avoid
	The so-called "debts of human relations" refer to the need to spend money on weddings, funerals, childbirth, baby's first month, elderly birthdays, festivals, and so on. Additionally, when a child gets into a good university, a "scholar's banquet" must be held; when starting a job, a "bottle-opening wine" must be drunk; when moving into a new house, the "pot must be burned"; even a normal job transfer requires a few tables of "farewell wine" on one side and a "welcome banquet" on the other. If one is promoted or receives an award, a "celebratory wine" must also be drunk. Each of these occasions, at the very least, costs tens of yuan, and at most, hundreds of yuan. As people's living standards improve, the categories and prices of "debts of human relations" are increasing, making it difficult for ordinary families to cope.

	A certain factory's office worker, in May, went with his wife to the countryside to attend his wife's nephew's wedding. As soon as they entered the door, his wife, according to custom, took out 200 yuan as a "gift," followed by 100 yuan as a "kneeling gift" for the bride and groom, and before eating, another 10 yuan as a "spoon gift." In this way, one "wedding banquet" cost the couple their entire month's salary and bonus.

	In July, in a certain factory's collective dormitory area, 7 households had weddings. Old worker Zhu received 7 invitations and had to send 40 yuan to each family as a "gift," with the entire family of 5 people having to attend each banquet.

	"Debts of Relationships" — Hard to Avoid
	The so-called "debts of relationships" refer to handling interpersonal relationships, especially superior-subordinate relationships and various complex work relationships, such as job transfers, housing applications, job promotions, family planning, seeking medical treatment, children's schooling, kindergarten enrollment, recruitment, and so on, all of which require gifts.

	Due to the commercial nature of interpersonal and normal work relationships, "I do you a favor, you do me a favor" has become a condition for equal exchange. If one party has power, while the other has no position or power, to maintain an "equal" relationship, one can only use money to balance it. A worker from a certain factory, in order to let his child attend a high-quality key school, went through direct and indirect relationships with more than 10 people to plead, spending over 100 yuan on gifts, finally achieving his wish. Afterwards, he happily said, "Spending this little money to get the job done is worth it!" A retired worker, to quickly solve the problem of his child's replacement job, ran to 3 houses in one night, buying 6 boxes of high-end cigarettes, as well as some pastries and canned goods, spending his entire month's retirement salary.

	"Debts of Children" — Hard to Repay
	Various intangible debts entangle millions of ordinary families, and the most difficult to "repay" is the "debt of children."

	An old worker said, "Who doesn't want their children to be successful, grow up quickly, and start a family? But now, young people only see the money in their parents' hands and do not feel the hardships of their parents' labor. As a result, the children have become the parents' biggest 'creditors.' I am 55 years old, and I have 3 children. My eldest son got married, and I took out 3,000 yuan; my second daughter got married, and I spent 5,000 yuan on her dowry. Now my youngest son has found a partner. He said to me, 'Dad, all parents love their youngest child. This time, you handle my wedding.' He gave me a 'wedding gift purchase list,' and I took a look: color TV, refrigerator, carpet, wall lamps, chandeliers, bedding, and so on, adding up to more than ten thousand yuan. I said, 'Even if you sell me, I can't come up with so much money!' The child said, 'Dad, this is still a cost-saving plan for you. I didn't ask for a VCR, stereo system, wedding ring, necklace, you see, who can get married without these things now?'"

	This "debt of children" that is difficult to repay not only includes a large sum of money spent on children's weddings but also a heavy burden of labor. Many old workers, after retirement, involuntarily become the "four-in-one" of their children's families: cook, shopper, nanny, and cleaner. A retired female worker wanted to travel with her husband after retirement, but her children's persuasion and the third generation's demands made her unable to go.

### 一本人间难念的经  家庭“债务”

    一本人间难念的经
    家庭“债务”
    当金钱维系着人与人之间的一切关系时，谁都会感到苦恼。然而，正是这些苦恼的人，又是容忍这种社会流俗，进而推波助澜，结果反受其害，更为苦恼。
                  ——题记
    应该讲，现在人民生活水平普遍提高了。可是，人情靠金钱维系，办事靠拉关系，奢靡铺张、好逸恶劳等心理注入生活之中。不少家庭额外支出、超计划支出增多，种种应酬如同债务缠身，难于躲避，给家庭生活罩上了阴影。
    “人情债”——难躲
    所谓“人情债”，是指遇婚嫁、丧葬、生孩子、婴儿满月、老人庆寿、过节等皆要花钱。此外，孩子考上大学要摆“状元宴”，参加工作要喝“开瓶酒”，乔迁新居必须“燎锅底”，甚至一个人的正常工作调动，也要这边摆上几桌“辞行酒”，那边准备“接风宴”，若要被提干或受奖，还要举杯痛饮“庆功酒”。这些礼项哪一种临身，少则几十元，多则上百元。随着人们生活水平的提高，“人情债”的门类越来越多，价码也越来越高，使普通家庭难以招架。
    某厂一名科室工作人员，今年5月随妻赴农村参加其妻侄的婚礼。一进门，他妻子按风俗便掏出了200元，叫“封礼”，接着又要给新郎、新娘拿“叩头礼”100元，吃饭之前还要拿“勺头礼”10元。就这样，一次“喜酒”就花去了夫妻俩人的全月工资和奖金。
    7月的一个星期天，某厂一个集体家属宿舍区有7户人家娶媳嫁女。老工人朱某接到了7份请柬，只好每家送去40元钱作“封礼”，全家5口人还得全部出动，分别到各家赴宴。
    “关系债”——难免
    所谓“关系债”，就是为处理好人际关系，特别是上下级关系和各种复杂的工作关系，诸如工作调动、住房申请、职务聘任、计划生育、求医看病、子女入学、幼儿入托、招工转干等等，都要以礼相见。
    由于人际关系和正常的工作关系染上了浓厚的商品关系色彩，“我给你办事，你也要给我办事”便成为对等交换条件。如一方有权势，而另一方无职无权，要保持“对等”关系，只好以钱来拉平。某厂一工人为了让子女能到一所教学质量比较高的重点学校读书，先后通过直接关系、间接关系10余人从中说情，花去礼钱百余元，最后总算如愿以偿。事后，他高兴地说：“花这点钱就把事办成了，值得，值得！”有一退休工人，为尽快解决子女顶替工作问题，他一晚上跑了3家，光高档烟就买了6条，还买了些糕点、罐头等物，花去了全月的退休工资。
    “儿女债”——难还
    各种无形债务缠绕着千百万个普通家庭，其中最难“偿还”的还是“儿女债”。
    一位老工人说：“谁不希望自己的子女有出息，能尽快长大，成家立业，可是，现在的年轻人只看到父母手中有钱，体会不到父母劳作一生的艰辛，结果孩子们却成了父母最大的‘债主’。我今年55岁，身边有3个孩子，大孩子娶妻我拿出了3000元，二女儿出嫁，我为她置办嫁妆花去5000元。现在小儿子又谈好了对象。他对我说，‘爸爸，天下爷娘疼小儿。我这次结婚您看着办。’他给我一张‘结婚礼品购置单’，我一看，什么彩电、冰箱、地毯、壁灯、吊灯、床上用品等等，加起来需要花费上万元。我说：‘你把我卖了也拿不出这么多钱！’孩子却说：‘爸爸，我这还是为您节约打算的，什么录像机、组合音响、结婚戒指、项链我都没要，您看看，现在谁结婚能少这些东西’。”
    这种难以还清的“儿女债”，不仅包括子女婚嫁时的一大笔支出，而且还有繁重的劳务负担，不少老工人退休后，不由自主地当上了子女家中的“四大员”，即炊事员、采购员、保育员、清洁员。一位退休女工，本想退休后和老伴一起外出旅游一趟，然而，子女的劝说，第三代的扯腿，使她一直未能成行。
