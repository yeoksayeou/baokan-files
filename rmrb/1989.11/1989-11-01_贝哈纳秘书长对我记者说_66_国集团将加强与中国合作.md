Secretary-General Behan told our reporter that the 66-country group will strengthen cooperation with China.

Our reporter Wei Wei reported from Brussels on October 30th: On the afternoon of October 29th, Gebre Behan, who had just been elected as the next Secretary-General of the 66-country group of Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific, told a Chinese reporter in Luxembourg that the 66-country group will strengthen cooperation with China.

Behan said that the countries of the Africa-Caribbean-Pacific region hope to increase economic and trade exchanges with all countries, develop friendly relations, and attach importance to South-South cooperation.

When discussing the relationship between the Africa-Caribbean-Pacific region and the European Community, he believes that the Lomé Convention is important to both sides. To renew the convention, the countries of the Africa-Caribbean-Pacific region have made great efforts and sacrifices. If an agreement can be reached, it will have a positive impact on improving South-North relations and promoting the economic development of the Third World.

The current Secretary-General of the 66-country group of Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific, Edwin Carrington, will complete his term in February 1990.

Behan has previously served as one of the two co-chairs of the Africa-Caribbean-Pacific-European Community Joint Assembly, Minister of Planning of Ethiopia, and Ethiopian Ambassador to the European Community.
