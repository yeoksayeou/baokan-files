In the vast Songliao Plain of Jilin Province, agricultural infrastructure construction is underway on a grand scale. Every day, 1.2 million people are mobilized across the province, braving the cold and sweating profusely. According to data from the Jilin Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, the province has mobilized over 30 million person-days of labor this autumn. By mid-November, 23,000 water conservancy projects have been completed, with a cumulative work volume of 8,355 cubic meters. Nearly 3 million mu of land have been improved for flood control, 700,000 mu of paddy fields have been ensured for irrigation, and over 500,000 mu of land have been treated for soil erosion, significantly improving production conditions.

Jilin Province is China's largest commercial grain base. After suffering severe natural disasters such as drought, floods, and frost this year, the provincial party committee and government further realized that only by improving agricultural infrastructure can the province enhance its ability to withstand natural disasters. Thus, they issued a mobilization order to "suffer one year of disaster and recover in one year."

In agricultural water conservancy construction, many leading cadres insist on being at the forefront. The Bai City region, which has long suffered from the Nenjiang River floods and droughts, has seen party, government, and military leaders from the five major departments take charge of different areas, working and living alongside farmers on the construction sites. In Yanji City, over 200 party members and cadres from 47 departments have all rushed to the construction sites to work with farmers for a week of dredging. In Dunhua City, the party secretary of Linsheng Township, Song You, led his entire family, including his wife and children, to join the construction efforts.

Carrying out socialist cooperation, with various industries supporting the effort, is a notable feature of Jilin Province's agricultural water conservancy construction this year. Yitong County organized 15 villages with over 60,000 laborers to work on the Yitong River project, completing it quickly and with high quality. The people remarked, "A major project that we have long wanted to do but couldn't, has been completed this year through large-scale cooperation."

　　领导干部带头　各行各业支援
　　吉林120万人上阵修水利
    本报长春11月23日电　新华社记者陈明星、周长庆报道：在吉林省千里松辽平原上，农田基本建设正波澜壮阔地展开。全省每天出动120万大军，顶着严寒，挥汗如雨。据吉林省水利厅提供的数据，全省今秋累计出工3000多万个，到11月中旬，已完成各类水利工程2.3万项，完成累计工程量8355立方米，改善治涝控制面积近300万亩，恢复和保证水田灌溉面积70万亩，治理水土流失面积50多万亩，显著改善了生产条件。
    吉林省是我国最大的商品粮基地。今年遭受旱涝霜冻等严重自然灾害后，省委省政府进一步认识到，只有搞好农田基本建设，才能提高抗御自然灾害的能力，于是发出“一年受灾，一年恢复”的动员令。
  在农田水利建设中，许多领导干部坚持站在第一线。深受嫩江洪水袭扰和干旱之苦的白城地区，党政军五大班子领导干部分片包干，在工地上与农民同吃同住同劳动。延吉市47个局的200多名党员干部，全部奔赴工地，和农民一起清淤一周。敦化市林胜乡党委书记宋友，带领妻子、孩子全家人挥锹上阵。
    开展社会主义大协作，各行各业都支援，是吉林省今年农田水利建设的显著特点。伊通县组织15个村6万多劳力大战伊通河，进度快，质量好。群众感慨地说：“多年想干而干不了的大工程，今年开展大协作干上去了。”
