The First Machinery Manufacturing Corporation of Inner Mongolia has introduced software technology from the German Mercedes-Benz company. Recently, it produced 10 prototype heavy-duty trucks, which, after testing, met the design standards.

This new type of heavy-duty truck is not only suitable for high-speed roads but also adapts well to desert and other terrains. The overhaul mileage is between 400,000 to 600,000 kilometers, and the domestic production rate reaches 38%.

Currently, the company has signed a contract to formally produce 100 trucks.
