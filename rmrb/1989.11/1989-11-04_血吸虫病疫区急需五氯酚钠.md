Schistosomiasis is a serious disease that severely endangers the health of the people. Currently, it is the optimal time for snail eradication during the autumn season. Our county is a severely affected area in the province, with an existing area of 41,774 mu infested with Oncomelania hupensis, making the task of snail eradication both arduous and challenging. Leaders and doctors from various grassroots townships, towns, and schistosomiasis control organizations have unanimously reflected that sodium pentachlorophenate, a highly effective snail eradication drug welcomed by the local population, is in short supply and cannot be found in the market, failing to meet the demand for snail eradication. Statistics show that since 1988, the county actually needs 328 tons of sodium pentachlorophenate for snail eradication, but only 115 tons have been supplied from higher authorities, leaving a shortage of 213 tons. This has resulted in 21,300 mu of snail-infested areas not being eradicated, affecting the normal progress of schistosomiasis control work. Other counties and cities in the province also face this common problem.

Why is the snail eradication drug sodium pentachlorophenate so scarce? According to the authors' investigations, there is only one factory nationwide that produces this drug, and the quantity is far from meeting the total demand for snail eradication drugs across the country. The production of sodium pentachlorophenate requires the intermediate product of the pesticide "DDT" as a raw material, which is highly toxic and harmful to the human body, and the raw materials are limited, failing to meet the production needs. Moreover, the use of this drug easily causes environmental pollution, leading the factory to limit production.

To protect the health of the people in the endemic areas, restore and protect the labor force, and promote the development of industry, agriculture, and commodity production, we appeal:

We hope that relevant factories will take emergency measures to accelerate the production of the snail eradication drug sodium pentachlorophenate. We also hope that the commercial departments will speed up the allocation and transportation to meet the urgent needs of schistosomiasis control work.

### 血吸虫病疫区急需五氯酚钠

    血吸虫病疫区急需五氯酚钠
    血吸虫是一种严重危害人民群众身体健康的疾病。当前，正值秋季灭螺大好时机，我县是全省重疫区，现有钉螺面积41774亩，灭螺任务繁重而艰巨。一些基层乡、镇、血防组领导和医生普遍反映，受疫区群众欢迎的高效灭螺药物五氯酚钠紧缺，在市场上到处买不到，满足不了灭螺的需求。据统计，自1988年来，全县实际需要灭螺药物五氯酚钠共328吨，上面只供应115吨，还差213吨，造成21300亩次有螺面积不能得到灭螺，影响了血防工作的正常开展。全省其他疫区县、市均存在这个共性问题。
    灭螺药物五氯酚钠为何这样紧缺？据笔者走访了解，生产这种药的全国只有一个厂家，其数量之少，远远不能满足全国灭螺用药的总需求；生产五氯酚钠要用农药“六六六”粉的中间产物作原料，毒性大，对人体有害，且原料少，不能保证生产需要；加之使用这种药容易污染环境，厂家限量生产。
    为了保护疫区人民的健康，恢复和保护劳动力，促进工农业和商品生产的发展，我们呼吁：
    希望有关厂家采取紧急措施，抓紧灭螺药物五氯酚钠的生产，也希望商业部门加快调拨转运工作，以满足血防工作急用的需要。
