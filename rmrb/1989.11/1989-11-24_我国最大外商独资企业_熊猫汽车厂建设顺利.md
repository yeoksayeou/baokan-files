	China's largest foreign-funded enterprise, the Panda Automobile Manufacturing Plant, is currently under rapid construction in Huizhou City, near the Daya Bay in Guangdong Province. The progress is smooth, and it is expected that the first car will be produced by the end of next year.

	This automobile manufacturing plant, funded by the American Panda Automobile Company with an investment of 10 billion dollars, began construction in June this year. It is planned to achieve an annual production capacity of 300,000 small, popular cars by 1995, with all products being exported.

	Recently, reporters drove to the construction site of the "Panda" project and saw that this once desolate area, where "young people leave and only the old and weak remain, fields are barren, and chickens and dogs are silent," is now bustling with activity. The construction site is busy with vehicles coming and going, moving mountains and leveling the ground. The barren land is now covered with new flat surfaces. The first phase of the project has acquired 2 square kilometers of land, and people are hurriedly building assembly workshops, paint factories, administrative buildings, and car parking lots. Many foreign investors who came to see this large-scale project being implemented were reassured and felt that they had fallen behind. They eagerly proposed to invest in supporting facilities for the "Panda" project or to start new investment projects. Currently, more than 20 countries and regions have invested and set up factories here. The director of the Daya Bay Development Office, Zhang Mingxing, told reporters: "The 'Panda' project was signed just a month ago, and the land price here has risen sharply. Now it continues to rise."

　　我国最大外商独资企业
　　熊猫汽车厂建设顺利
    新华社广州11月20日电　（记者王志纲、欧阳鸿鹄）我国目前最大的外商独资企业——熊猫汽车制造厂正在广东大亚湾畔的惠州市加紧建设，进展顺利，预计明年底可生产出第一辆汽车。
    这家由美国熊猫汽车公司投资10亿美元建设的汽车制造厂，是今年6月破土动工的，计划1995年形成年产30万辆小批量普及型轿车的生产能力，产品全部外销。
    最近，记者驱车来到“熊猫”工程工地，看到这个昔日“少壮难留余老弱，田园荒芜鸡犬寂”的地区，现在已是热闹非凡，一片繁忙。工地车来车往，移山推土，不毛之地上泛出崭新的平面。第一期工程已征地2平方公里，人们正在这片土地上加紧建设组合车间、油漆厂、行政大楼和汽车停车场等。许多前来这里的外商投资者亲眼看到这一巨资项目正在实施，都吃了“定心丸”，深感自己落伍了，于是，争先恐后地提出要为“熊猫”项目配套设施进行投资，或另开新的投资项目。目前已有20多个国家和地区的厂商在这里投资办厂。大亚湾开发办公室主任张明星告诉记者：“熊猫”项目刚签约一个月，这里的地价直线上升，现在继续看涨。
