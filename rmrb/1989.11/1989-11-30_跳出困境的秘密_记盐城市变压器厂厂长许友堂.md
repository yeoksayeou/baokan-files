The Secret to Breaking Out of a Dilemma – A Record of the Director of Yancheng City Transformer Factory, Xu You Tang

Yan Zhongyi, Yan Shigui

Xu You Tang is considered a miraculous figure in Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province. In reality, he is a stocky man with a dark purple face. Time has bestowed upon him a head of white hair.

In his life, Xu You Tang has dealt with tools like plumb bobs, axes, and chisels. Since 1950, when he first entered the factory with his toolbox, he has worked in construction sites, cement plants, and transformer factories. This article recounts Xu You Tang's efforts to revitalize the Yancheng City Transformer Factory.

In 1980, when he took over as the director of the transformer factory, the factory buildings were dilapidated and the machinery often broke down. The bank account had only one fen (0.01 yuan) in it, and workers had not received their wages for several months. Out of 93 workers, 27 had left without notice.

To say that Xu You Tang had no hesitation is not true. But his hesitation was brief. He told his friends and relatives, "A Communist Party member is like a brick, to be moved wherever needed!"

Not long after taking office, Xu You Tang encountered an embarrassing situation. The sales representative he had sent out had not yet returned, but a return order had already arrived at the factory. The reason was that the factory's reputation was poor, and the other party had changed their mind.

He understood that low-quality products would have no place in the market. But to improve product quality, he needed to rely on technical personnel.

One day, while on a bus, Xu You Tang learned that a retired senior technician from the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory was not only skilled but also responsible. This person was named Gu Panrong. Xu You Tang was overjoyed and immediately rushed to Shanghai, only to find that Master Gu had returned to his hometown in Wuxi. Ignoring his fatigue, Xu You Tang rushed straight to Wuxi. Seeing the sincerity of the visitor who had traveled thousands of miles, the old man was moved. Five days later, Master Gu accompanied Xu You Tang to the factory.

As expected, the old mining lamp charging rack produced earlier had poor performance and was criticized by users as "used for 3 days, repaired for 5 days." After Master Gu and several other invited "guests" worked together to solve the problem, they quickly developed a new model. After being evaluated by relevant research departments, it was deemed comparable to the Shanghai mining lamp charging rack. The Jiangsu Fengpei Mining Area placed an order for 47 units.

With the help of a group of foreign talents, the transformer factory raised its product quality to a new level. Xu You Tang then decided to select some high school graduates from the factory and send them for training. A year later, he decided to spend 150,000 yuan to establish a vocational school. By doing both, he cultivated talent. Now, the workers who were sent out and the first batch of vocational school students have returned after completing their studies and have been assigned to various departments and workshops. Previously, young workers like Ge Yurong and Xu Jiyou, who couldn't even draw a proper blueprint, became smart after several years of study at the South China Institute of Technology. In a short time, they independently developed a low-consumption energy-saving transformer, bringing excitement to the transformer market where losses were generally severe. After being evaluated by provincial-level research institutions, the total power consumption was 13.89% lower than the department standard and 2.6% lower than similar products from the Federal Republic of Germany. Consequently, they won the "Golden Bull Award" for new product development in Jiangsu Province. In 1988, this product was exported to Morocco. Ge Yurong and Xu Jiyou were promoted to deputy director and technical director, respectively.

With talented people, the factory became more prosperous. However, Xu You Tang was not satisfied. He realized that having talent, developing projects, expanding scale, and improving standards still required equipment updates. He discussed with the factory leaders to invest money in key areas, building a fully enclosed large workshop, adding punching machines, bending machines, etc. He often said, "With money, a building can be built in a year. But cultivating a talent and developing a new product takes at least three to five years!"

It was with this selfless dedication and keen insight that Xu You Tang, in just a few years, turned this formerly loss-making township-owned small factory into a medium-sized enterprise with a production value of over ten million yuan and profits of over one million yuan. He himself was awarded the titles of provincial labor model, outstanding party member, and outstanding party worker. This year, he proposed a new slogan for the entire factory: "Catch up with Changzhou (Transformer Factory), pursue Wuhan (Transformer Factory), strive for a production value of two hundred million yuan and profits of two hundred million yuan!"

　　跳出困境的秘密
　　——记盐城市变压器厂厂长许友堂
　　颜中一　颜世贵
    许友堂，在江苏盐城市被人们传为神奇人物。其实他，矮壮的体形，酱紫色的脸膛。岁月恩赐，一头白发。
    生活中的许友堂，曾同墨斗、斧头、凿子打交道。自打1950年背起工具箱跨进工厂大门，从办建筑站开始，接下去就是水泥厂、变压器厂。这里记述的，是许友堂振兴盐城市变压器厂的一段故事。
    1980年，当他接任变压器厂厂长时，厂房简陋破旧，机器开开停停。银行帐户上只有1毛钱的存款，工人已几个月拿不到工资了。93人的小厂，竟有27人不辞而别。
    要说许友堂没有一点犹豫，那也不是事实。但他的犹豫是很短暂的。他对亲朋好友说：“共产党员是块砖，哪里需要哪里搬！”
    许友堂到任不久，就遇到了一件令人难堪的事。派出去的供销员还没返回，“退货单”却已寄到了厂里。原因是，声誉不好，对方翻悔了。
    他明白，质量低劣的产品，休想在市场上有立锥之地。但要提高产品质量，必须依靠技术人员。
    一天，许友堂在汽车上得知上海电机厂有位退休老技师，不仅手艺精湛，而且工作负责。这人叫顾盘荣。许友堂不禁喜上眉梢，随即赶往上海，不料顾师傅回了无锡老家。许友堂忘记疲劳，又直奔无锡。老人见来者千里迢迢，心诚意切，心动了，5天后，顾师傅同许友堂一道来到了这家厂。
    果然不负众望。原来生产的矿灯充电架性能粗劣，用户批评“用3天修5天”。现经顾师傅和其他几位请来的“客人”一起攻关，扬长避短，很快搞出了新式样机。经有关科研部门鉴定，认为可与上海矿灯充电架比美。江苏丰沛矿区，一次订货47台。
    变压器厂借助一批客籍人才，将产品质量提高到一个新的水平。许友堂又决定从厂里挑选一些高中生，送出去代培。一年后，又决定拿出15万元办一个中专班。双管齐下，培养人才。如今，送出去的职工、中专班第一届学生，已学成归来，分配到各个科室、车间。以前连一张正规图纸也描不准的青工葛玉庆、许吉友，经过在华南工学院的几年深造，变得聪明起来。在很短时间内，自行研制出的低耗节能变压器，给损耗普遍严重的变压器市场带来了兴奋。经省级科研单位专家鉴定，总电耗比部标低13.89％，比联邦德国同类产品低2.6％，因而获得江苏省新产品开发“金牛奖”。1988年，这种产品飘洋过海，出口摩洛哥。葛玉庆、许吉友分别走上了副厂长和技术科长的岗位。
    人杰厂兴。变压器厂越来越红火，可许友堂不满足。他体会，有了人才，上项目，上规模，上水平，还离不开设备的更新。他同厂领导商量，把钱用在刀口上，建起了全封闭大车间，增添了冲床、弯板机……他常说：“有钱一年就可盖起一幢楼。可培养一个人才，搞出一个新产品，没有三年五年不行！”
    许友堂正是凭借着这种无私的奉献精神和敏锐的目光，在短短的几年内，使这个原先亏损的镇办小厂，一跃而成为产值超千万、利润超百万的中型企业。他本人，则荣获了省劳模、省优秀党员和省优秀党务工作者的称号。今年，他又在全厂提出了新的口号：“赶常州（变压器厂），追武汉（变压器厂），力争产值双千万，利润双百万！”
