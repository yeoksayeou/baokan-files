Wan Heping, a 35-year-old lieutenant colonel military doctor, is not well-known. Since 1983, he has been engaged in the diagnosis and treatment of headaches and has 17 years of medical experience. His name has spread through the 6,000-plus headache patients he has cured. Not only in Beijing, but also in Henan, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Northeast China, and even overseas Chinese and foreign friends, he has treated common people, high-ranking officials, and even overseas Chinese and foreign friends.

In 1972, he joined the army as a platoon medic. In 1976, he attended the Beijing Medical University Medical College, graduating in 1980 and assigned to the regiment's medical team as a military doctor. Later, he was transferred to the division hospital, retirement home, and other units as a health doctor.

In a room at the People's Liberation Army hospital in Shunyi County, Beijing, with only one bed, two desks, and a few chairs, we met Dr. Wan. He is of medium build, has a refined face, and was examining a patient. After the consultation and examination, Dr. Wan first injected a colorless, transparent liquid into two symmetrical points at the back of the patient's head, leaving the needle in place. After two minutes, he used a finer syringe to inject another liquid through the needle, removed the needle, and the treatment was completed.

Dr. Wan said that the first colorless, transparent liquid is a nutritional local anesthetic, and the second pink liquid is the headache injection he developed. The treatment method is based on modern medical theory, drawing on successful experiences from acupuncture, acupoint injection, block therapy, and local drug administration methods.

A patient told us that he is a deputy chief physician from Shenyang, 59 years old, and has suffered from refractory vascular headache for over 30 years. During an attack, his head would split with pain, and he would feel nauseous and vomit. He had been hospitalized in major hospitals in Beijing and Shanghai eight times, with little effect. Usually, he took painkillers every day to maintain his condition. After a few treatments with Dr. Wan, the pain was significantly reduced.

Dr. Wan introduced that headaches are a very common medical symptom. They can be divided into secondary headaches and primary headaches. Primary headaches generally have no identifiable cause; they can start suddenly, with mild cases causing pallor and restlessness, and severe cases causing unbearable pain. There is no special treatment for primary headaches domestically or internationally. It is understood that there are at least 10 million primary headache patients in China, and headaches seriously threaten their health and lives.

The diligent Wan Heping reviewed a large amount of domestic and international literature, combined with clinical experience, conducted experiments, and explored... Most primary headaches are caused by minor lesions in more than 30 parts of the head and neck, such as nerves, muscles, and periosteum. These minor lesions are often overlooked by doctors.

He used a combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, combining several Chinese and Western medicines into an injection, and then directly injecting the liquid into the affected area. After hundreds of experiments, he succeeded.

Practice has proven that this method is simple, safe, causes little pain, is cost-effective, works quickly, and has lasting effects. Among the more than 6,000 patients treated, the cure rate is over 95%, with most patients cured after one treatment and a few requiring two or more treatments. There have been no adverse reactions or medical accidents.

We flipped through some case histories:

Li X, a 30-year-old student studying in the United States, had suffered from headaches for three years, with several attacks per month, each lasting one to two hours. During an attack, he would not want to open his eyes, accompanied by tearing, irritability, and memory loss. He specially returned to China for Dr. Wan's treatment twice, and the symptoms disappeared.

Dr. Wan receives letters from patients at home and abroad every day. He always tries to reply to each one. On average, he sees 20-30 patients a day, and no matter how tired he is, he always tries to meet the patients' needs. Patients have highly praised Dr. Wan's excellent medical skills and noble medical ethics: "The soul has ascended to the ninth heaven, the divine doctor's hands bring people back to life."

Dr. Wan smiled modestly at these praises: "I have also had failures, and I am not a divine doctor. I have no other requests. If I could establish a specialized clinic for headache patients, to relieve the pain of more headache patients, that would be my greatest wish."

　　向头痛病挑战的万和平
　　本报记者　廖玒　刘晓林
    万和平，一个年仅35岁的少校军医，名不见经传。1983年从事头痛病的诊疗工作，是一位有17年医务工作经验的医生。
    他的名字通过他治愈的6000多头痛病患者在民间传开了。不仅北京，远至河南、上海、浙江、东北……他诊治的有平民百姓，也有身居高位的领导者，还有旅外侨胞、外国友人。
    他1972年入伍，当连队卫生员，1976年上北京医科大学医疗系，1980年毕业分配到团卫生队当军医，后调到师医院、干休所等单位当保健医。
    在北京顺义县城解放军某部队医院，一间只有一张床、两张桌子、几把椅子的房间里，我们见到了万医生。
    他中等身材，面目清秀，正给病人看病。经过问诊和查体后，万军医先用一种无色透明的药水注射到病人脑后对称的两个部位，并留住针头不拔，过两分钟后，再用较细的注射器在留住的针头上注射一种药水，取下针头，治疗即告结束。
    万军医说，先用的无色透明的药液是一种营养局麻药，后用的粉红色药水，即是他研制的头痛注射液。治疗方法则是以现代医学理论为基础，借鉴了针灸及穴位注射、封闭疗法、局部注药方法等成功经验。
    患者告诉我们，他是来自沈阳的副主任医师，59岁，患顽固性血管神经性头痛已30余年，发作时头痛欲裂、恶心、呕吐。曾先后到北京、上海等地大医院住院治疗8次，疗效都不显著。平时天天用止痛片维持，来万军医这儿治了几次，很见效，头不痛了。
    万军医介绍说，头痛是一种极常见的医学症状。可分为继发性头痛和原发性头痛。原发性头痛一般找不出病因，说痛就痛，轻者面色苍白，坐卧不安，重者痛不欲生。对原发性头痛，国内外尚未发现特殊疗法。据了解，我国至少有1000多万原发性头痛病人，头痛严重地威胁着他们的健康和生命。
    爱钻研的万和平查阅了大量国内外有关资料，结合临床经验，试验、摸索……
    多数原发性头痛，是由于头颈部的神经、肌肉、骨膜等30多个部位的轻微病变引起的。这种轻微病变不易引起注意，常常被医生忽视了。
    他采用中西医结合的方法，用数种中西药物配制成注射液，再把药液直接注射到病因部位。经过上百次试验，成功了。
    实践证明，这种方法操作简便、安全、痛苦轻、花费少，见效快且疗效持久。在已治疗的6000多例病人中，治愈率达95％以上，多数人一次治愈，少数人要治疗两次以上。从未发生过任何毒、副反应和医疗事故。
    我们随手翻了一下病历：
    留美学生李×，30岁，头痛3年，一个月发作数次，每次一、二小时，发作时不愿睁眼，伴有流泪，怕躁怕乱，记忆力减退，专程回国请万军医治疗两次，症状就消除了。
    万军医每天都收到来自国内外的求医信件，他总尽可能一一回信。平均每天接待二三十位病人，再累也尽可能满足病人要求。病人对万军医精湛医术、高尚医德作了高度评价：“生灵已去九重天，神医妙手回人间”。
    对这些赞誉，万大夫淡淡一笑：我也有过失败，更不是神医。我别无所求，如果能建立一所头痛病专科诊所，为更多的头痛病人解除病痛，这是我最大的愿望。
