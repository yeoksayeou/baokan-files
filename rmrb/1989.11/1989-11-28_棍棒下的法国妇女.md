Title: French Women Under the Cudgel

	French women are suffering under the cudgel. The 60-year-old Madame Bégat has spent her entire life under her husband's brutal beatings. She said with a self-mocking tone, "This might be his way of loving me."

	Madame Bégat's marriage was less than three months old when the beatings began. Her husband would smash dishes, tear up the clothes she made, and even beat her with a belt. One night, he threw her out of the house in her nightgown. Madame Bégat curled up on the stairs, her nose bleeding continuously.

	Madame Bégat's experience is not unique. Statistics show that in this country, which prides itself on "human rights," "democracy," and "equality," there are over 2 million women who frequently face belts and cudgels, nearly one-tenth of the female population. Last year alone, the French police recorded tens of thousands of cases of husbands beating their wives, most of which ended up being dismissed.

	Recently, a French television station organized a discussion on abused women, with participants including women, sociologists, medical personnel, legal professionals, and women's rights advocates. A woman named Danielle recounted that one day, after being beaten by her husband, she fled with her three young children. No one helped her, and she was still wandering the streets at night. When she reached the most heart-wrenching part of her story, the women in attendance could not help but cover their faces and weep. Some had bruises on their faces and visible injuries. They angrily pointed out: France has this law and that law, but which one protects abused women?

	For a long time, French society has been reluctant to address this serious social issue. Most abused women, for the sake of their children and family, are ashamed to speak out, and their tears flow silently. Statistics show that abused women come from all walks of life, with 51% being workers. Only a small fraction of them dare to come forward and accuse their abusers. Because once they do, they will face many complex legal procedures, such as obtaining medical certificates, finding witnesses, and hiring lawyers. Many women are deterred by this.

	French women's organizations have issued a call to "save women." The French women's rights department began a three-week publicity campaign on November 15, airing advertisements on television and posting posters to break the social silence and inform victims of their rights, aiming to break this "taboo."

	However, some sociologists analyze that husbands beating their wives in France has deep social roots, such as unemployment, poverty, ignorance, and alcoholism. As long as these social ills are not eliminated, the effect of publicity campaigns can only be limited.

　　棍棒下的法国妇女
　　本报记者　吕网大
    年逾花甲的老人贝捷特太太，一生竟是在丈夫的棍棒下熬过来的。她带着自嘲的口吻说：“这也许是他爱我的方式。”
    贝捷特太太婚后不到3个月，就开始遭受丈夫毒打。丈夫一不高兴就摔餐具，撕她做的衣服，甚至将她按在地上用皮带猛抽。有一天深夜，他竟把身穿睡衣的妻子赶出门外。贝捷特太太蜷缩在楼梯下，鼻子不停地淌血。
    贝捷特太太的遭遇决非个别情况。据统计，在这个自诩最讲“人权”、“民主”、“平等”的国度里，经常与皮带和棍棒为伴的妇女竟有200多万，几乎占女性总数的1／10。仅去年，法国警方就记录了十几万起丈夫虐妻案，结果多是不了了之。
    不久前，法国电视台组织了一次关于被虐待妇女的讨论会，参加者除妇女外，还有社会学家、医务人员、司法界和妇权界人士。一位叫达尼尔的妇女诉说道，有一天，她被丈夫毒打后，带着3个幼子出逃，哪儿也没人管，深夜还在路上奔走。说到伤心处，与会的妇女们禁不住掩面而泣，她们之中有的鼻青眼肿，脸上留有明显的伤痕。她们愤愤指出：法国有这个法、那个法，可哪一条能保护受虐待的妇女？
    在法国，长期以来，人们一直不愿触及这一严重的社会问题。大多数受虐待的妇女为了孩子和家庭，羞于声张，眼泪只得往肚里流。据统计，被毒打的妇女涉及各个阶层，其中工人占51％，她们中只有一小部分人敢于站出来控诉。因为，一旦她们出面检举，就要面对许多繁杂的法律程序，如请医生开医疗证明，找证人，找律师，许多妇女对此都怯而止步。
    法国的妇女组织已发出了“救救妇女”的呼吁。法国妇权部门从11月15日起开展为期3周的宣传活动，在电视台播放宣传广告，并张贴海报，以打破社会的沉默，并让受害人了解自己的权益，争取破除这个“禁忌”。
    然而有的社会学家分析说，丈夫打妻子在法国是有深刻的社会原因的，诸如失业、贫困、愚昧、酗酒等。只要这些社会痼疾消除不了，宣传活动能起到的作用就只能是有限的。
