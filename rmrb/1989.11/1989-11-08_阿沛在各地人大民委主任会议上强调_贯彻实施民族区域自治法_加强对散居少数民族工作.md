Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 7th.

Alpu Alwanjinmei, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Committee on Ethnic Affairs, emphasized in the closing speech of the National Conference of Chairpersons of Ethnic Affairs Committees of Provincial, Autonomous Region, and Municipal People's Congresses that comrades in ethnic affairs committees at all levels should strengthen their study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, arm themselves with Marxist-Leninist theories on nationalities, establish a proletarian worldview and nationalities view, correctly understand the importance and long-term nature of nationalities issues, and enhance their awareness of implementing the Party and state's policies and laws on nationalities.

During the five-day conference, the attendees seriously discussed the draft report on "Opinions on Several Issues Regarding the Implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy and Current Ethnic Work" to the Chairman's Meeting, exchanged experiences in the work of ethnic affairs committees, and further studied the issue of ethnic legal system construction with the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy as the center.

Alpu Alwanjinmei emphasized in his closing speech that while implementing the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, we must also strengthen work on scattered ethnic minorities. He said that work on scattered ethnic minorities is an important aspect of China's ethnic work. Scattered ethnic minorities are distributed throughout the counties and cities of the country, and 20 million ethnic minority people are scattered across the country, making it easy for them to be overlooked. Since the founding of the People's Republic, some unstable factors in China's ethnic issues often appear in areas where scattered ethnic minorities reside.

Alpu Alwanjinmei pointed out that with the reform and opening up, exchanges among ethnic groups are becoming increasingly frequent, and the number of ethnic minority people from ethnic regions entering cities and coastal areas for business, setting up enterprises, handling affairs, and traveling will increase. The horizontal economic ties and cooperation between ethnic regions and various provinces and cities will also strengthen. Therefore, we must place the work on scattered ethnic minorities in an important position in the Party and state's ethnic work.

Alpu Alwanjinmei said that at present, China's work on scattered ethnic minorities has achieved great success and accumulated a lot of experience. The state has formulated many effective policies, and many provinces and cities have taken good specific measures to protect the rights and interests of scattered ethnic minorities. The state has the conditions to formulate necessary laws to guarantee the equal rights of scattered ethnic minorities. However, there are still many problems in the work on scattered ethnic minorities, and we need to do a lot of work. He required ethnic affairs committee cadres at all levels to raise their awareness, work hard, and seriously strengthen work on scattered ethnic minorities to make new contributions to the unity and common prosperity of all ethnic groups.

It is understood that the Committee on Ethnic Affairs of the National People's Congress will, based on the opinions of the attendees at this conference, further revise and supplement the draft report on "Opinions on Several Issues Regarding the Implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy and Current Ethnic Work" to the Chairman's Meeting, striving to fully and accurately reflect the situations and opinions of various places.

Yu Wen, Li Xuezhi, Aisin Gioro Pujie, Li Gui, Tao Aiying, and Pingcuo Wangjie attended the conference.

    阿沛在各地人大民委主任会议上强调
    贯彻实施民族区域自治法  加强对散居少数民族工作
    新华社北京11月7日电  （记者郑庆东、张银曙）全国人大常委会副委员长、人大民委主任委员阿沛·阿旺晋美在今天结束的全国各省、自治区、直辖市人大民委主任会议上强调，各级人大民委的同志要加强马列主义和毛泽东思想的学习，用马列主义关于民族问题的理论武装头脑，确立无产阶级的世界观和民族观，正确认识民族问题的重要性和长期性，增强贯彻党和国家民族政策和法律的自觉性。
    在为期五天的会议期间，与会同志认真座谈讨论了《关于贯彻实施民族区域自治法和当前民族工作几个问题的意见》向委员长会议的汇报提纲，交流了人大民委工作的经验，进一步研究了以民族区域自治法为中心的民族法制建设问题。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美在大会结束时的讲话中强调在贯彻实施民族区域自治法的同时，还要加强散居少数民族工作。他说，散居少数民族工作是我国民族工作的一个重要方面。散居少数民族遍布全国各县、市，二千万少数民族人口散居在全国各地，很容易被忽视。建国以来，我国民族问题的一些不安定因素，往往出现在散居少数民族所在的地方。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美指出，随着改革开放，各民族交往日趋密切，各民族地区的少数民族人口进入城市和沿海地区经商、办企业、办事、旅游将日益增多，民族地区和各省市的横向经济联系和合作将日益加强。因此，我们一定要把散居少数民族工作提到党和国家民族工作的重要位置上来。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美说，目前我国散居少数民族工作已取得了很大成绩，积累了不少经验，国家已经制定了许多行之有效的政策，有很多省市还采取了很好的具体措施来维护散居少数民族的权利和利益，国家制定必要的法律来保障散居少数民族的平等权利已经具备了条件。但是散居少数民族的工作还存在不少的问题，还需要我们做大量的工作。他要求各级人大民委干部提高认识，扎扎实实地认真加强对散居少数民族的工作，为各民族的团结和共同繁荣作出新的贡献。
    据了解，全国人大民委将根据这次会议中与会同志的意见，对《关于贯彻实施民族区域自治法和当前民族工作中几个问题的意见》向委员长会议汇报提纲作进一步的修改和补充，力求全面、准确地反映各地的情况和意见。
    郁文、李学智、爱新觉罗·溥杰、李贵、陶爱英、平措汪杰出席了会议。
