Title: Scholarship and Freedom in Learning

Over the years, I have increasingly felt that Mr. Qian Zhongshu's contributions to the study of Chinese classical literature, the achievements he has reached, and the significance of these contributions and achievements in the history of culture and scholarship, have not been truly recognized or adequately understood in the field of classical literature. The reason for this is a lack of research.

Our research in classical literature needs to be elevated. One important path to this elevation is to learn from our predecessors. This means summarizing our research practices from the perspective of the history of scholarship, especially conducting detailed and humble research on the scholarly thoughts and academic paths of those masters who have made outstanding achievements and reflect the high level of scholarly development of their time. This is an indispensable task for classical literature research to gain contemporary awareness. Before us, there are already monumental works such as "Talking About Art," "Guanzhai Notes," "Selected and Annotated Songs of the Song Dynasty," and "Seven Essays." If we do not study these works and continue to repeat known understandings at a low level, how can we claim to have genuine research? Mr. Qian's scholarly approach provides us with a high standard, making us understand that this is the true way of pursuing scholarship, and only such scholarly pursuits have real significance in the academic world. This prevents those who are eager to learn from being satisfied with superficial knowledge and encourages them to strive forward. I believe that anyone who genuinely takes the time to read Mr. Qian's works will have this feeling.

I feel that among our generation, or those slightly younger, in the study of classical literature, some have achieved more, some less, and some have newer or older styles of writing. However, it seems that there is always a certain formula. Whether it is a study of a writer, a work, or an exploration of a certain era or topic, it is difficult to escape a fixed pattern. Mr. Qian, however, is different. In his work, it seems he has transcended all formulas or patterns. Mr. Qian did not specifically write any critical essays on writers or any particular studies or poetry critiques. It seems that he only casually mentioned them in his writing, but even these seemingly casual words are the essence of the study of writers and works. This kind of scholarly research that transcends formulas and patterns is often described by ancient scholars as a state of enlightenment, and it is precisely what we should strive to study. This may break through the relatively single-minded shortcomings that exist to varying degrees in the current study of classical literature, broaden the researcher's vision, and thus invigorate the research atmosphere and enrich the research content.

However, Mr. Qian's transcendence of formulas is a natural result of his deep scholarship. Without such deep learning, forced imitation would only appear contrived. Mr. Qian placed Chinese literature within the broader context of world literature, naturally making his perspective far-reaching and effortless. He also placed Chinese literature within the larger system of ancient and modern scholarship, thus clearly distinguishing its similarities and differences and observing its changes. When exploring a certain creative intention, he would also draw from various literary genres, inspiring the mind and writing with ease. In discussing the lines "Instant beauty with a glance, smiling yet not revealing" from Tao Yuanming's "Rhapsody on Indulging in Carnal Pleasures," besides quoting poems and prose as examples, he also cited "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" "Green Plum," the 60th chapter of "Journey to the West," and the 38th chapter of "The Story of the Stone." Such examples are found throughout "Guanzhai Notes." Some people's poetry and prose notes, especially works from the Ming and Qing dynasties, seem to have been mentioned only by Mr. Qian. After Mr. Qian's citation, these seemingly insignificant works gain new value, and readers gain great satisfaction in their understanding and appreciation, making us marvel at the rich treasures of ancient Chinese literature.

For the field of classical literature, studying Mr. Qian's works should be on our agenda. Currently, some researchers are already engaged in this, and they are achieving results. However, the quantity and scale of such research are still far from sufficient, and they are disproportionate to Mr. Qian's contributions and their significance in the history of scholarship. It is not an exaggeration to say that whether in China or abroad, to study Chinese classical literature and to extend from the current foundation, one must understand what Mr. Qian Zhongshu has already discussed. To explore the current state and development of Chinese classical literature, Mr. Qian Zhongshu is a necessary academic subject. This subject will cultivate a new academic style: a serious and elevated scholarly attitude, a method of scholarship that combines Eastern and Western cultures, breadth and depth, and a scholarly demeanor that is unconstrained and free.

    学养深厚与纵逸自如
    傅璇琮
    这些年来，我越来越感到，钱钟书先生对中国古典文学研究所作出的贡献，他所达到的成就，以及这些贡献和成就在文化学术史上的意义，在古典文学界，并未有真正的认识，因而也未能被充分的理解，而所以如此，是因为缺乏研究。
    我们的古典文学研究需要提高，提高的一条重要途径，就是要向前辈学者学习。这就是说，要从学术史的角度，对我们的研究实践进行总结，特别是对一些有突出成就，能体现一代学术高度发展的大师们的学术思想和学术道路作细致的、虚心的研究。这也就是古典文学研究要取得当代意识的一项必不可少的工作。在我们的面前，已经有了《谈艺录》、《管锥编》、《宋诗选注》、《七缀集》这样壁立千仞的著作，我们如果不对它们进行研究，而还不断地在一个低水平上重复已知的认识，怎么有真正的研究可言呢？钱先生在治学上对我们后辈的启示，就是树立一个高标准，使我们懂得，这才是真正的做学问，这样的治学才真正在学术上有意义，这才使一切有志者不致浅尝辄止，而奋进不已。我想，真正静下心来读钱先生的著作，都会有这样的一种感觉。
    我觉得，在我们这一辈，或比我们晚一些的，在古典文学研究中，所获有多有少，笔法有新有旧，但似乎总有一种程式，不管搞一个作家论或作品研究，或一个时代、一个命题的探讨，总摆脱不开一种固定的格局。而钱先生却不然，在他那里，似乎已纵逸于一切程式或格局之外。钱先生没有特地写什么作家评论，或什么某某研究、某某诗评，他似乎在行文中偶一涉及，但就是这些看来不经意的寥寥数语，却正是作家、作品研究的精髓所在。这种能超然于程式、格局的学术研究，古人往往用化境加以形容，正是我们要着力研究之点。这可能会突破目前古典文学研究程度不等地存在着的较为单一的缺陷，使研究者视野能有所开阔，从而活跃研究的空气，丰富研究的内容。
    但钱先生的这种超然于程式，是他深厚的学养之必然，学养不到这一步，勉强模仿，就会显得做作。钱先生把中国文学置于世界文学的总背景下加以观照，自然就目光四射，举重若轻。他又把中国文学放在古今学术的大系统中加以考察，这样就能明其异同，观其通变。在探索某一创作意向时，他又会通各种文学体裁，启人心智，又涉笔成趣。论陶渊明《闲情赋》的“瞬美目以流眄，含言笑而不分”二句，除了引诗文作例证外，还引了《聊斋志异》的《青梅》，《绿野仙踪》第60回写齐蕙娘，《儿女英雄传》的第38回。这样的情况在《管锥编》中到处可见。有些人的诗文笔记，特别是明清人的一些作品，似乎除了钱先生引述过以外，过去再也没有人曾经提起过。经钱先生一加引述，使这些本来似乎无甚意义的作品获得新的价值，也使读者在认识和鉴赏中获得极大的满足，让我们惊奇地发现中国古代文学会有如此丰富的宝藏。
    对于古典文学界来说，研究钱先生的著作应该提到我们的日程上来。目前已有一些研究者在做，他们正在取得成绩，但这种研究的数量和规模还远远不够，与钱先生的贡献及其在学术史上的意义太不相称。可以毫不夸张地说，无论国外或国内，要研究中国古典文学，要在现有的基点再往前延伸，就必须明白钱钟书的著作已经谈到了什么，而要研讨当代的中国古典文学现状和发展线索，则钱钟书是一个必须研究的学术课题，这个课题将能养成一代新的学风：一种严肃的、境界高尚的治学胸怀，融合中西文化、广博与精深相结合的治学手段，不拘一格、纵逸自如的治学气派。
