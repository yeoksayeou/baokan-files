PLO and U.S. representatives met again in Tunis. According to the Palestine News Agency, PLO representative in Tunis, Hakim Barawi, and U.S. Ambassador to Tunis, Robert Pelletreau, held a meeting here today. The two sides discussed the recent developments in the Middle East peace process.

This meeting is part of the ongoing PLO-U.S. dialogue and political consultations, aimed at promoting a peace process that respects the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.

According to the Tunis Africa News Agency, citing an authoritative source from the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, Egypt has requested that the PLO modify its response to U.S. Secretary of State Baker's proposal. This authoritative source also said that the PLO's response needs some modifications and supplements to remove obstacles in the current efforts for the Middle East peace process.

PLO Executive Committee member Jamal Surani reported to Egyptian leaders on November 21st about the PLO's response to the U.S. proposal. He said that the main obstacle in the consultations currently being conducted between the U.S. and the PLO through Egypt is the issue of the PLO's representation.

    新华社突尼斯11月28日电　据巴勒斯坦通讯社报道，巴解组织驻突尼斯代表哈基姆·巴拉维和美国驻突尼斯大使罗伯特·佩莱特鲁今天在这里会晤，双方讨论了关于中东和平进程的最近发展情况。
    这次会晤是巴美对话和政治磋商的一部分，旨在推动为促进符合巴勒斯坦人民合法权利的和平进程。
    据突尼斯非洲通讯社援引埃及外交部权威人士的话报道，埃及要求巴解组织修改它对美国国务卿贝克的建议的答复。这位权威人士还说，巴解组织的答复需要作些修改和补充，以便目前所作的努力能为中东和平进程排除障碍。
    巴解组织执委会委员贾迈勒·苏拉尼21日已向埃及领导人通报了巴解组织对美国建议的答复。他说，美国和巴解组织之间通过埃及正在进行的磋商主要在巴解组织的代表性问题上遇到了障碍。
