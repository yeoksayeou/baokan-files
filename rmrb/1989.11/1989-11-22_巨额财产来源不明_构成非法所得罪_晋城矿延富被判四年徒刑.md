The Jincheng City District People's Court recently tried a case involving a huge amount of unaccounted wealth. The defendant, Yan Fu, was convicted of illegal gains and sentenced to four years in prison. This is the first such case in Shanxi Province.

Yan Fu, 54, is the deputy director of the Parts Section of the Mechanical and Electrical Department of the Jincheng Coal Mine Bureau. On March 31, a large amount of property, including 43,000 yuan in cash, was stolen from Yan Fu's home. The police quickly solved the case and apprehended the thief. News of the large sum of money stolen from Yan Fu's home spread throughout the entire mine area. The District Procuratorate then initiated an investigation into Yan Fu's "huge unaccounted wealth."

During a search of Yan Fu's home, additional cash, bank drafts, and savings books were discovered, totaling 114,000 yuan in assets. Yan Fu refused to explain the source of these funds.

After thorough investigation and debate, the court determined that Yan Fu's family's total assets and expenditures, minus his legal income, amounted to a surplus of 63,000 yuan. Yan Fu could not explain the legal source of this amount. According to relevant Chinese laws, the court ruled that Yan Fu had committed the crime of illegal gains and sentenced him on the spot.

    本报太原电　山西省晋城市城区人民法院最近审理了一起巨额财产来源不明案，被告人延富以非法所得罪被依法判处有期徒刑4年。这是山西省判处的第一件非法所得案。
    延富，今年54岁，是山西省晋城矿务局机电处配件科副科长。今年3月31日，延富家中大批财物被盗，仅现金便有4.3万元。公安机关很快便破获了此案，抓获了盗犯。延富家中巨款被盗的消息不胫而走，传遍了全矿区。城区人民检察院遂以“巨额财产来源不明”对延富立案侦查。经对延富家搜查，又查出大批现金、存款支票、存折，财产共值11.4万元。延富拒不说明这些款项的来源。
    法庭经过认真调查和辩论，认定延富全家财产和支出减去其合法收入，尚余6.3万元，延富本人不能说明其合法来源，根据我国有关法律，法庭宣判延富已构成非法所得罪，当庭进行了宣判。		（王艾生　岳联国　马倩如）
