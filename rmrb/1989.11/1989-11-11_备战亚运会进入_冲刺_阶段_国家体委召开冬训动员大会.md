Preparations for the Asian Games Enter the "Sprint" Stage
State Sports Commission Holds Winter Training Mobilization Meeting

BEIJING, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) — As China's athletes are about to enter the winter training period, the State Sports Commission held a mobilization meeting today in Beijing to prepare for the Asian Games. Wu Shaozu, the head of the State Sports Commission, urged all athletes, coaches, staff, and cadres involved in the Asian Games and related work to mobilize every nerve, muscle, and bone to fully invest in the preparations for the Asian Games.

Wu Shaozu said that there are 315 days left until the opening of the Asian Games and only 120 days until the opening of the Winter Asian Games. Now we can say we are in the sprint stage. We must seize this precious time to train hard and work diligently to strive for outstanding results and bring glory to the country.

China has over 1,400 athletes participating in various projects for the Asian Games. Currently, except for some teams training in other regions and those participating in major competitions, the rest of the teams are training in Beijing. Over 1,000 athletes, coaches, and State Sports Commission officials attended today's mobilization meeting.

Yuan Weimin, deputy head of the State Sports Commission, gave a nearly two-hour mobilization speech. He emphasized that it is especially important to remind all teams not to be complacent, assuming that the host country has many advantages and thus being overly optimistic. The lesson from the 1986 Asian Games, where we underestimated the difficulties and nearly lost to South Korea, must not be forgotten. Our opponents are all training hard and preparing actively. Our leading teams must remain vigilant, and the lagging teams must boost their spirits and turn the tide by implementing daily training measures.

Yuan Weimin also announced that to better enforce strict training and management and cultivate a good fighting spirit, the State Sports Commission has decided that the Asian Games training teams will undergo a short-term military training session before winter training to learn from the People's Liberation Army.

    备战亚运会进入“冲刺”阶段
    国家体委召开冬训动员大会
    本报北京11月10日讯　记者刘小明报道：正当我国体育健儿即将进入冬训之际，国家体委今天在北京召开备战亚运会的动员大会。国家体委主任伍绍祖在会上要求体育系统参加亚运会和为亚运会工作的所有运动员、教练员、工作人员及干部，都紧张行动起来，要调动起自己的每一根神经、每一块肌肉和骨头，全力投入亚运会的准备工作。
    伍绍祖说，今天离亚运会开幕还有315天，离冬季亚运会开幕只剩120天了，现在可以说到了冲刺阶段。我们一定要抓紧最后这段宝贵时间努力训练，勤奋工作，力争创造优异成绩，为国争光。
    我国参加亚运会各项目集训队的运动员总数据了解有1400多人，目前除一部分在外地训练和正在参加重大比赛的队伍外，其余的队均在北京集训。这些队的运动员、教练员以及国家体委干部1000多人出席了今天的动员会。
    国家体委副主任袁伟民在会上专门作了近两小时的动员报告。他指出，当前特别要提醒各队不得有麻痹松懈情绪，以为东道主有利条件多，因而盲目乐观。1986年亚运会上我们对困难估计不足，险些败给南朝鲜的教训不能忘。我们的对手都在抓紧训练，积极备战。我们的优势项目队伍要居安思危；落后项目队伍要振奋精神，把打翻身仗的愿望措施落实到每天训练中。
    袁伟民还宣布，为了更好地严格训练严格管理，培养优良战斗作风，国家体委决定亚运会集训队在冬训前分别进行一次短期军训，好好向解放军学习。
