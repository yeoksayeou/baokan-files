Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 4th.

In recent days, trucks loaded with cabbages have been continuously entering the city from the suburbs. Green piles of cabbages and busy shoppers can be seen everywhere in the urban areas. By tonight, 175 million kilograms of cabbages have already been put on the market, with a sales volume reaching 125 million kilograms. Winter storage supply has entered its peak period.

At the beginning of this year, Beijing City arranged over 300,000 mu of vegetable fields in the suburbs and nearby areas, and planted an additional tens of thousands of mu. The area for commercial cabbage planting alone increased by 28,000 mu compared to last year. To motivate farmers to grow vegetables, the municipal government allocated 4 million yuan in subsidies for pesticides and fertilizers. It is reported that Beijing City has abundant vegetable sources this year, with good quality, which can meet the needs of people's lives.

Beijing Municipal Government attaches great importance to the work of winter storage of cabbages, establishing a command center to coordinate actions. The transportation department dispatched more than 2,000 people to the production sites to coordinate vehicles. The commercial department mobilized more than 21,000 people, setting up over 2,000 stalls. Some even went deep into alleys and residential buildings to deliver vegetables to the doorstep.

Although the price of first-grade cabbages has increased by 1.5 fen compared to last year, the production cost of cabbages is high, and it is still at a loss compared to the purchase price. Last year, Beijing City increased the purchase price of cabbages but did not adjust the selling price. For this alone, the municipal government subsidized over 30 million yuan. This year, after appropriate adjustments, a large amount of subsidies is still expected to be needed.

### 北京大白菜产销两旺  冬贮供应进入高峰　可以满足市民需求

    北京大白菜产销两旺
    冬贮供应进入高峰　可以满足市民需求
    本报北京11月4日讯　记者颜世贵报道：连日来，满载大白菜的卡车从四郊源源不断地进入京城。城区到处可见绿油油的菜堆和忙着购买的人群。截至今晚，已上市大白菜1.75亿公斤，销售量达1.25亿公斤。冬贮供应开始进入高峰。
  今年初，北京市在远近郊区安排菜田30多万亩的基础上，又多种了几万亩，仅调市商品大白菜种植面积就比去年增加2.8万亩。为了调动农民种菜的积极性，市政府光用于农药、化肥的补贴就达400万元。据介绍，今年北京市的菜源丰富，质量较好，可以满足人民生活的需求。
    北京市政府对做好冬贮大白菜工作十分重视，专门成立指挥部，统一行动。交通运输部门抽出2000多人到产地现场协调车辆。商业部门投入2.1万多人，设摊点2000多个。有的还深入街巷楼群，送菜上门。
    虽说今年一级菜价比去年提高一分五厘，但大白菜生产成本高，同收购价相比还是倒挂。去年，北京市提高了大白菜收购价，未调整销售价，仅这项，市政府就补贴3000多万元。今年作了适当调整，预计仍要拿出大量补贴。
