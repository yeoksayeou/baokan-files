Police Officer Yu Junsheng Bravely Fights Criminals and Sacrifices Himself

According to Xinhua News Agency in Haikou on November 7, the 21-year-old police officer Yu Junsheng bravely fought criminals alone on the streets of Haikou and sacrificed his life.

At around 5:30 PM on October 31, a group of gamblers were harassing passersby in front of the bustling Haikou Wanghai International Hotel, trying to cheat them out of money. Four citizens exposed their scheme, but were then beaten by six or seven gamblers. Some of the gamblers drew out knives, ready to attack.

At this moment, Communist Party member and young police officer Yu Junsheng of the Haikou Public Security Bureau Patrol Squad, who was on duty in plainclothes, happened to pass by. He stepped forward and shouted, "I am from the Public Security Bureau," and grabbed the wrist of one of the criminals, attempting to handcuff him.

The criminals, relying on their numbers, shouted, "Even the Public Security Bureau should be beaten," and rushed forward. Four of them drew knives and stabbed Yu Junsheng in the back of the head, chest, and back.

Yu Junsheng endured the pain and fought back, his hands tightly gripping one of the criminals. As more and more onlookers gathered, the criminals saw that the situation was not in their favor and fled in panic. Yu Junsheng, seriously injured, fell to the ground in a pool of blood. The crowd immediately sent him to the hospital, but due to his severe injuries, he sacrificed his life.

After the incident, the Haikou Public Security Bureau immediately organized officers to pursue the criminals. Currently, four criminals have been captured and brought to justice.

    民警余俊生勇斗歹徒壮烈牺牲
    据新华社海口11月7日电  （记者任小东、夏凯旋）21岁的民警余俊生在海口街头只身勇斗歹徒，壮烈牺牲。
    10月31日下午5时30分左右，一伙赌徒在热闹繁华的海口望海国际大酒店门前，纠缠过路行人聚赌骗钱。4名群众当场揭露了他们骗钱的勾当，结果遭到六七名赌徒的殴打。有的赌徒拔出匕首准备行凶。
    这时身着便装、正在执勤的共产党员、市公安局巡逻大队青年民警余俊生正好路过此地。他挺身而出，喝道：“我是公安局的”，并抓住一名歹徒的手腕准备用手铐铐住。
    这伙歹徒仗着人多势众大叫：“公安局的也要打”，说着一拥而上，其中4名歹徒拔出匕首向余俊生的后脑、胸部、背部刺去。
    余俊生忍着剧痛与歹徒搏斗，双手始终紧抱着一名歹徒不放。此时围观的群众越来越多，歹徒见势不妙仓皇逃跑。余俊生身负重伤倒在血泊中，群众立即把他送到医院，但因伤势过重，壮烈牺牲。
    此案发生后，海口市公安局立即组织干警追捕凶犯。目前已有4名歹徒被抓获归案。
