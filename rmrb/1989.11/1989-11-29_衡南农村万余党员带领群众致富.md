Over 10,000 rural Party members in Hengnan County, Hunan Province, have taken the lead in establishing nearly 2,000 joint prosperity groups with 31,000 households, helping the masses develop commodity production and achieve prosperity.

Hengnan County has a rural population of 870,000. Since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, the county's rural economy has developed significantly, but some farmers have yet to shake off poverty. In early 1988, the Hengnan County Committee, in accordance with the principle of combining voluntary grouping with organizational planning, mobilized Party members to establish joint prosperity groups with the masses, with Party members as the core and wealthy individuals as the backbone, to carry out extensive mutual aid and joint prosperity activities.

The joint prosperity groups led by Party members mainly focus on three aspects to carry out mutual aid activities. First, they formulate joint prosperity plans. The groups investigate the economic situation of each household, identify the causes of poverty, analyze the favorable and unfavorable conditions for production development, and help members determine business projects, production scale, and development directions. Second, they provide economic and material support. The groups raise funds and materials to provide targeted support for households with poor foundations and few laborers, helping them invest in production. Third, they utilize the strengths of each member, leveraging group advantages to share farming, breeding, processing, and business technologies, forming a diversified and comprehensive production pattern.

According to incomplete statistics, over 16,000 people in the joint prosperity groups have become production experts, with more than 5,100 new specialized households, and over 1,200 impoverished households have shaken off poverty.

　　衡南农村万余党员带领群众致富
    本报讯　湖南省衡南县万余农村党员发挥带头作用，分别与3.1万农户建立近2000个共同致富小组，帮助群众发展商品生产，脱贫致富。
    衡南县拥有农业人口87万，十一届三中全会以来，该县农村经济有了较大发展，但仍有部分农民未能摆脱贫困。1988年初，衡南县委按照就地就近自愿组合与组织划定相结合的办法，发动党员与群众建立共同致富小组，以党员为中心、以致富能手为骨干，广泛开展互帮互助共同致富活动。
    由党员领头的共同致富小组主要从三个方面入手，开展互帮互助活动。一是制定共同致富规划。由小组摸清各家各户经济状况，查找贫困原因，分析发展生产的有利条件和不利因素，帮助组员制定经营项目、生产规模和发展方向等；二是给予经济物资扶持。小组筹集一定的资金物资，对基础差、劳力少的贫困户给予重点扶持，帮助他们进行生产投资；三是利用组员各自的专长，发挥群体优势，互相传授种田、养殖、加工、经营等技术，形成多种经营、全面发展的生产格局。
    据不完全统计，共同致富小组中有16000多人成为生产能手，新增各类专业户5100多户，1200多贫困户摆脱贫困。
