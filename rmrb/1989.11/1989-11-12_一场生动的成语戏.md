    A Vivid Performance of Idioms

    From my youth to middle age, from elementary school to university, I have seen many plays, and I have also acted in and directed a few. However, they have all faded from my memory, except for one that I cannot forget—the idiom play directed by our class teacher, Zhu Weiliang, in the sixth grade of elementary school.

    At that time, we were all innocent children. Teacher Zhu Weiliang, to strengthen our ability to remember idioms, wrote a script based on idioms and directed us.

    One beautiful afternoon, our class gathered on the playground and began the unique idiom play. The boy Zheng Xin Hua opened the show. According to the "director's" instructions, he frowned, as if very troubled, and said "愁眉苦脸" (worried and distressed). At this point, I went against the grain and said "欢天喜地" (overjoyed), my mood was relaxed, and I smiled, making people feel the joy. Then, a boy stood up abruptly, his face stern, and shouted "声色俱厉" (speaking in a stern and harsh voice), which immediately dispelled the joyful atmosphere I had created. Next, a boy stood up and shouted "勃然大怒" (suddenly became very angry). His angry expression was overwhelming, like dark clouds pressing down on a city. After the storm, spring colors filled the garden, and flowers bloomed. A female classmate spoke in a soft voice, "和风细雨" (gentle breeze and fine rain), and another female classmate followed with "百花齐放" (hundreds of flowers blooming) and "姹紫嫣红" (various colors of flowers). Naturally, their performances were vivid and lifelike.

    Twenty-five years have passed in the blink of an eye. Whenever I write an article, idioms come to mind easily and naturally. I have not specifically studied idioms, but I think the benefit comes from that idiom play! One play not only deepened our memory but also was full of interest, lively and vivid, making us both gain knowledge and escape the tedium of long-term rote memorization. This, I believe, is the true art of teaching.

    一场生动的成语戏
    从少年到中年，从小学到大学，我看过的戏多，演过与编过的戏也不少，但都淡忘了，唯令人不能忘怀的，是小学六年级时由班主任朱维亮导演的那场成语戏。
    那时，我们都是一群天真烂漫的孩子，老师朱维亮为了加强我们记成语的能力，他将有关成语编成“成语剧本”，然后为我们导演。
    一个美好的下午，我们班围坐在操场上，开始了别开生面的成语戏。男孩郑新华开场，他按着“导演”规定，皱着眉头，仿佛很苦恼，说出“愁眉苦脸”。这时，我反其道而言之，吐出“欢天喜地”，情绪轻松，面带微笑，让人感受欢乐情趣。接着，一男孩勃然而起，面色严峻，直呼出“声色俱厉”，将我创造的欢乐气氛一扫而光。其后，一男孩拍案而起的是“勃然大怒”。怒色逼人，有如黑云压城。风云霁后，便是春色满园，百花吐蕊，一女同学以娇美之音吐出“和风细雨”，又一女同学继之以“百花齐放”、“姹紫嫣红”……自然，她们的表演神态都惟妙惟肖。
    转眼间，25年过去了，每逢我写文章时，成语便信手拈来，呼之欲出，我也不曾专修过成语，深思之，大约受益于那场成语戏罢！一场戏，既加深记忆，又富有情趣，生动活泼，使我们既有收获，又摆脱长时间乏味的背诵，这，才是真正的教学艺术。
