The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee of the People's Republic of China Issues a Statement on the U.S. Congress Passing an Amendment to Sanction China

(1989-11-20)

1. On November 15 and 16, the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, despite repeated objections and negotiations from the Chinese government, passed the State Department Authorization Act amendment to sanction China. This amendment grossly distorts the facts of China's actions to stop the turmoil and quell the counter-revolutionary riot, maliciously slanders and attacks the Chinese government, and proposes a series of economic sanctions against China. We strongly condemn and protest against the U.S. Congress's arbitrary trampling of basic principles of international relations and gross interference in China's internal affairs.

2. More than five months have passed since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot. Practice has proven that the decisive measures taken by the Chinese government in accordance with the constitution and laws, as well as the policies implemented after the suppression, are in line with the wishes of the people and the fundamental interests of the state. These measures have not only received the firm support of the people across the country but also the understanding and support of an increasing number of countries and peoples who hold an objective and just attitude. However, the U.S. Congress's amendment ignores the basic facts, continues to distort right and wrong, spreads rumors, and uses them as the basis for legislation. It even proposes sanctions against China. This ugly display of power politics only exposes their arrogance and prejudice, helping people see the stubborn anti-China stance of certain forces in the U.S. Congress.

3. Mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence are recognized principles of international relations. The people of every country have the right to choose a social system and development path that suits their national conditions. No country has the right to impose its social system and values on others, nor does any country have the right to meddle in or interfere with the internal affairs of others. We never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and we will never allow any country to interfere in China's internal affairs. China's affairs can only be handled by the Chinese people themselves, and we will not allow any foreign government or parliament to intervene or interfere. We must warn the members of the U.S. Congress that the Chinese people, who have stood up, will never yield to external pressure. Attempting to impose pressure on China through economic sanctions is futile. Anyone who acts with the intention to harm others will end up harming themselves.

4. The current Sino-U.S. relations face severe difficulties, which is not what the Chinese people want to see, and the responsibility does not lie with the Chinese side. This situation is entirely due to the U.S. deeply involving itself in China's internal affairs, grossly interfering in China's internal affairs, and imposing sanctions on China. Currently, Sino-U.S. relations are at a crossroads. Restoring and developing Sino-U.S. relations is conducive to maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the world, and is in the fundamental interests of both countries. This is only possible on the basis of both sides adhering to the three Sino-U.S. joint communiqués and the five principles of peaceful coexistence. For the sake of the long-term interests of both countries, we urge the U.S. Congress to immediately stop all actions that interfere in China's internal affairs, hurt the national feelings of the Chinese people, and worsen bilateral relations. Cancel the amendment to sanction China and make efforts to restore normal Sino-U.S. relations as soon as possible. If you insist on going further down the anti-China path, then we will only persist in struggle and will never yield. The serious consequences that follow will be entirely the responsibility of the U.S. side.

### 人大外事委员会发表声明　谴责美国会通过制裁中国的修正案

　　人大外事委员会发表声明
　　谴责美国会通过制裁中国的修正案
    新华社北京11月20日电　中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会外事委员会关于美国国会通过制裁中国的修正案的声明
      （1989年11月20日）
    一、11月15日和16日，美国众、参两院不顾中国政府的多次反对和交涉，分别通过了制裁中国的国务院授权法修正案。该修正案肆意歪曲我国制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的事实真相，恶毒污蔑和攻击中国政府，提出了一系列对中国的经济制裁措施。对于美国国会这种恣意践踏国际关系基本准则、粗暴干涉中国内政的霸权主义行径，我们表示强烈的谴责和抗议。
  二、平息反革命暴乱已经过去5个多月。实践证明，中国政府依据宪法和法律采取的果断措施以及平暴后实行的一系列政策，符合人民的愿望和国家的根本利益，不仅得到了全国人民的坚决拥护，而且得到越来越多的持客观和公正态度的国家和人民的理解和支持。然而，美国国会的修正案却置基本的事实于不顾，继续颠倒黑白，散布谣言并以此作为立法的依据，竟然提出要对中国进行制裁。这种强权政治的丑恶表演，只能暴露出他们自己的狂妄和偏见，帮助人们看清美国国会某些势力敌视中国和中国人民的顽固立场。
    三、互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处是公认的国际关系准则。每一个国家的人民有权选择适合本国国情的社会制度和发展道路。任何国家都无权将自己的社会制度和价值观念强加给别国，也无权对纯属别国的内部事务指手划脚，横加干涉。我们从不干涉别国的内政，也决不允许别国干涉中国的内政。中国的事情只能由中国人民自己来管，绝不允许任何外国政府、议会插手或干涉。我们要正告美国国会议员们，已经站起来了的中国人民是永远不会屈服于外来压力的。企图通过经济制裁向中国施加压力完全是徒劳的。任何人从损人的目的出发，将以害己的结果告终。
    四、中美关系目前面临严峻困难，这是中国人民不愿意看到的，其责任也不在中国方面。这种状况完全是因为美国深深地卷入了中国的内部事务，粗暴干涉中国内政，对中国实行制裁造成的。目前中美关系正处于十字路口。恢复和发展中美关系有利于维护亚太地区和世界的和平与稳定，符合中美两国的根本利益。这只有在双方恪守中美三个联合公报，遵循和平共处五项原则的基础上才有可能。从维护中美两国的长远利益出发，我们敦促美国国会立即停止一切干涉中国内政、伤害中国人民民族感情、恶化两国关系的言行，取消对华制裁的修正案，为中美关系的早日恢复正常作出努力。如果你们一定要一意孤行，在反华的道路上越走越远，那么我们只能坚持斗争，决不屈服。由此而造成的严重后果，完全应由美国方面负责。
