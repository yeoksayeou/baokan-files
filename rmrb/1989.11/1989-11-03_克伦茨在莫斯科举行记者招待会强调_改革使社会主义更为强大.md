	Krenz Emphasizes in Moscow Press Conference that Reform Makes Socialism Stronger

	BERLIN, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- Erich Honecker, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Chairman of the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic, emphasized on November 1 that the reforms in the GDR are aimed at building a more attractive socialism.

	Krenz made these remarks at a press conference in Moscow yesterday afternoon.

	Krenz arrived in Moscow on the evening of October 31 for a working visit. He told reporters from the GDR, the Soviet Union, and other countries that he was very satisfied with the results of his talks with Gorbachev, and that both sides had reached a complete consensus on the issues discussed. He said that the experience of Soviet reforms is also important for the work of the GDR.

	Krenz pointed out that with the convening of the 9th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the SED, the GDR has undergone a turning point aimed at strengthening socialism through innovation and reform. Now that the GDR is in a new situation, if it wants to continue to move forward, it must carry out reforms.

	In discussing the former General Secretary Honecker, Krenz said that during Honecker's tenure as the leader of the party and state, the German Democratic Republic achieved great successes, and we have no need to be ashamed of this period.
