The head of the Chinese delegation, Qiao Shi, handed over the greeting message from the CPC Central Committee to the 14th National Congress of the RCP. The Xinhua News Agency reported from Bucharest on November 21 that Qiao Shi, head of the Chinese delegation attending the 14th National Congress of the Romanian Communist Party, handed over the greeting message from the CPC Central Committee to the congress, warmly congratulating the 14th National Congress of the RCP. The full text of the greeting message is as follows:

We extend our warm congratulations to the 14th National Congress of the Romanian Communist Party on behalf of the Communist Party of China. Through the congress, we express our sincere respect to all members of the Romanian Communist Party and the Romanian people.

The Romanian Communist Party has a glorious revolutionary history and has gone through nearly 70 years of brilliant struggle. Through long-term heroic struggles, the Romanian Communist Party led the Romanian people to establish a people's government, embark on the broad road of socialism, and open a new chapter in Romanian history.

During the years of socialist construction, especially since the 9th National Congress of the RCP in 1965, the Romanian Communist Party led by Comrade Nicolae Ceaușescu has inherited and carried forward the glorious revolutionary traditions, adhered to the scientific socialist doctrine, and insisted on independently formulating the policies for socialist revolution and construction. The party has steadfastly led the Romanian people to advance along the socialist road, building their country into a socialist state with modern industry, agriculture, and advanced science and culture. In international relations, the Romanian Communist Party has adhered to the policy of independence and self-reliance, advocating respect for the independence and sovereignty of all countries, equality and mutual benefit, and non-interference in internal affairs, firmly opposing hegemony, actively supporting the just struggles of the peoples of all countries, and making positive contributions to easing international tensions and maintaining peace and security in Europe and the world.

The convening of the 14th National Congress of the Romanian Communist Party is a major event in Romanian political life. We believe that the draft resolution and the new five-year plan and the guidelines for the long-term vision to 2000-2010 that will be discussed and adopted at this congress will surely present a more brilliant prospect for the construction of your beautiful country, socialist Romania. We sincerely wish the Romanian Communist Party and the Romanian people greater achievements in the new historical development stage.

The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people will, as always, make unremitting efforts to strengthen and develop the traditional friendship between China and Romania, which is based on the principles of independence, equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.

We wish the 14th National Congress of the Romanian Communist Party a complete success!

We wish the revolutionary friendship and combat solidarity between the two parties, the two countries, and the two peoples of China and Romania eternal prosperity!

    在社会主义建设的年代里，特别是1965年罗共九大以来，以尼古拉·齐奥塞斯库同志为首的罗马尼亚共产党，继承和发扬光荣的革命传统，遵循科学社会主义学说，坚持独立自主地制定社会主义革命和建设的方针，坚定地领导罗马尼亚人民沿着社会主义道路奋勇前进，把自己的祖国建设为具有现代化工业农业和先进科学文化的社会主义国家。在对外关系中，罗马尼亚共产党坚持独立自主方针，主张尊重各国独立主权、平等互利和互不干涉内政的原则，坚决反对强权政治，积极支持各国人民的正义斗争，为缓和国际局势、维护欧洲和世界的和平与安全作出了积极贡献。
    罗马尼亚共产党第14次代表大会的召开是罗马尼亚政治生活中的重大事件。我们相信，这次大会将要讨论和通过的罗共14大提纲和新的5年计划与到2000至2010年的远景方针的指示纲领，必将为你们美丽的祖国——社会主义罗马尼亚的建设展现出更为光辉的前景。我们衷心祝愿罗马尼亚共产党和罗马尼亚人民在新的历史发展阶段中取得新的更大的成就。
    中罗两党、两国人民，在长期共同的革命斗争和建设事业中，一贯相互同情，相互支持。中国共产党和中国人民将一如既往为不断加强和发展建立在独立自主、完全平等、互相尊重、互不干涉内部事务原则基础上的中罗传统友谊作出不懈的努力。
    祝罗马尼亚共产党第14次代表大会圆满成功！
    祝中罗两党、两国和两国人民的革命友谊和战斗团结万古长青！
