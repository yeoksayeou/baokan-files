	From a young age, I harbored a beautiful wish in my heart, which I once whispered in my mother's ear. At that time, my mother lovingly said to me, "Study hard, Mom believes in you." As a child, I wanted to study law because I admired the elegant and eloquent female lawyers on the silver screen. As I grew older, I gradually realized the importance of the legal system for socialist construction. I never imagined that I would fail and lose the opportunity to enter the law school.

	My passionate blood seemed to freeze suddenly, and I was speechless for a long time. Mom looked at me worriedly, wanting to say something but couldn't.

	One day, Mom went on a business trip and left me a tape: "Mom knows this is a big blow to you, but I believe you will hold on! You are a strong child. From a young age, you were raised by your aunt, and the days away from Mom tempered your tender heart. Our motherland has paved a broad road for your generation. As long as you have the desire to contribute to society, you can succeed in any career..."

	The whole family understood my silence with their silence. Mom's solemn words resonated in my heart.

	One evening, it was raining lightly. I said to Mom, "Mom, I want to go for a walk with you."

	"Alright, put on your clothes." Perhaps Mom didn't expect me to suggest a walk on a rainy day, or perhaps she knew I wanted to talk to her. Mom, after all, is Mom!

	In the rain mist, a small umbrella sheltered our mother-daughter shadows. The streetlights shone brightly through the mist, casting our shadows long and far.

	"Mom, yesterday I received a letter from my classmate Xingmei. She was admitted to the law school."

	"Oh, really?" Mom replied.

	"Mom, when I received the letter, I thought it was my admission notice. I forgot that my exam scores were not good enough. You know, Mom, studying law is my dream, so now I am attending a university run by society, and my major is still law." I paused and continued, "I want to work hard to pass all my courses through self-study exams and obtain the same level of education as Xingmei and others, to dedicate myself to the cause I love!"

	Mom hugged me tightly as we walked, "Child, you've grown up and become sensible. Mom is at ease now."

	In Mom's embrace, I felt my blood beginning to surge again. No matter what happens, no matter where we are, we will always feel the warmth of our mother. Our generation has not experienced much hardship. Our lives are often sunny days, but we will not always be naive, will not be mere spectators of life, and will not be parasites of society. How can we let our mothers down!

	Mom, did you hear our voices?

　　妈妈，你听到了吗
　　刘锦
    从小，我心里就埋藏着一个美好的愿望，曾趴在妈妈的耳边悄悄地说过。那时妈妈慈爱地对我说：“好好学习吧，妈妈相信你。”小时候想学法律，是因为崇拜银幕上那些风度优雅又有口才的女律师。长大了，则渐渐意识到法律制度对于社会主义建设的重要性。万万没想到，我落榜了，失去了进政法大学的机会。
      热情奔放的血液仿佛骤然冰冻，我好一阵说不出话来。妈妈担忧地望着我，想说点什么，却没说出。
    有一天，妈妈出差，给我留下一盘磁带：“妈妈知道这次给你的打击很大，但相信你会挺住的！你是个坚强的孩子，从小被寄养在姑姑家，离开妈妈的那些日子磨练了你稚嫩的心。而我们的祖国，为你们这一代铺展的道路很宽广，只要有为社会做贡献的愿望，从事任何事业都会有出息……”
    全家人用沉默理解着我的无言，妈妈语重心长的话语，叩动着我的心弦。
    一天晚上，天空飘着细细的雨。我对妈妈说：“妈，我想和您出去走走。”
    “好！你穿好衣服吧。”妈妈或许没想到下雨天我会提出去散步，或许料到我要和她讲点什么，妈妈呀，毕竟是妈妈！
    雨雾中，一把小伞遮着我们母女的身影，路灯透过朦胧的雨雾显得很亮，灯光把我们的身影拖得很长很长。
      “妈，昨天我收到星梅同学的一封信，她考上政法大学了。”
    “哦，是吗。”妈妈回答。
      “妈，收到信时，我还以为是我的录取通知书呢，竟忘了我的考试成绩根本不行。您知道的，妈，学法是我的理想，所以我现在上了社会办的大学，选择的专业仍是法学。”我顿了一下接着说，“我想努力使各门功课都通过自学考试，取得和星梅他们同等水平的学历，以献身于我热爱的事业！”
    妈妈紧搂着我走着，“孩子，你已经长大了，懂事了，妈妈也就放心了。”
    在妈妈的怀里，我感到我的血液又开始奔腾，奔腾……无论遇到什么，无论在什么地方，我们都会感受到母亲的温暖。我们这一代人没经过什么风雨，我们的生活中常常是晴朗的天，但我们不会总是幼稚，不会成为生活的旁观者和社会的寄生虫。我们怎能让母亲失望！
    妈妈，您听到我们的心声了吗？
