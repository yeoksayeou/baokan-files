Zhang Yongjin, a militia squad leader from Tongmuyuan Village in Xingshan County, Hubei Province, has killed 1,201 wild boars over 11 years, reclaiming a large amount of grain from their destruction.

Xingshan County is located in the western mountains of Hubei, where the terrain is rugged and sparsely populated, providing an ideal habitat for wild boars. These animals hide during the day and emerge at night, feeding on various grains, rooting up potatoes, gnawing on corn, and destroying wheat fields, causing significant harm to the local farmers. Zhang Yongjin resolved to protect the people by eliminating this menace. In 1978, he equipped himself with a homemade gun and patrolled the fields and hillsides at night. That year alone, he killed 75 wild boars, earning him the reputation of a legendary hunter in the region.

Zhang Yongjin's efforts in protecting the crops from wild boars have been recognized multiple times by the county, and he has been awarded the title of "Grain Guardian" and "Grain Protection Expert" by the Hubei Provincial Government.

　　张永金捕杀野猪千余头
    据新华社武汉11月26日电　（记者郑国联　通讯员张国清）湖北省兴山县桐木园村民兵排长张永金，11年捕杀野猪1201头，从猪口里夺回了大量粮食。
    兴山县地处鄂西山区，山大人稀，是野猪繁衍生息的天然场所。野猪昼伏夜出，以杂粮为食，拱洋芋，啃苞谷，毁小麦，给山区农民造成极大的危害。张永金立志为民除害。1978年，他自备火药猎枪，彻夜巡逻于田边山坳，当年就击毙野猪75头，成为远近闻名的“神猎手”。
    张永金打野猪护粮有功，多次被县里评为特等劳模，湖北省授予他“庄稼卫士，护粮能手”荣誉称号。
