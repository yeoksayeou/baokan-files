Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 22nd.

The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPCCC) held a meeting today and issued a solemn statement condemning the amendment passed by the U.S. Congress to sanction China. The committee expressed strong indignation and the strongest condemnation of the U.S. Congress's further interference in China's internal affairs.

The committee's chairman, Zhou Peiyuan, gave a speech, and the vice-chairman, Chai Zemin, presided over the meeting.

The committee members, in their speeches, pointed out that Sino-U.S. relations are currently facing severe difficulties, which are entirely the result of the U.S. deeply involving itself in China's internal affairs and interfering in China's internal politics. The recent passage of the amendment to the State Department Authorization Act by both the House of Representatives and the Senate in the U.S. Congress is a clear example of this.

They believe that more than five months after the Chinese government's lawful measures to quell the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, the facts have become clear to the world. However, the U.S. Congress's amendment ignores these basic facts and proposes further sanctions against China. This act of hegemony and power politics only exposes their arrogance, ignorance, and prejudice, and is a blatant violation of the basic norms of international relations, a serious step to worsen Sino-U.S. relations.

The committee members believe that the Chinese government's lawful measures to quell the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing have not infringed upon U.S. interests. Instead, it is the U.S. that owes the Chinese people. Now, the U.S. Congress has unilaterally passed an amendment to further sanction China, which is something the Chinese people absolutely cannot accept and "cannot but arouse our strongest indignation and protest."

They warn the U.S. Congress that the Chinese people are a proud and dignified nation with a strong sense of national pride, and they will not be intimidated by any reactionary forces. The Chinese people's resolve to follow the socialist path is unshakable.

The committee members once again advise the U.S. Congress not to impose its own social system and values on the Chinese people, to immediately cancel the amendment to sanction China, and to stop all actions that interfere in China's internal affairs and worsen bilateral relations.

They believe that China will never compromise on principles. If the U.S. thinks that a few so-called amendments can force China to yield and shake the Chinese people's resolve to follow the socialist path, it is nothing but a foolish dream that is doomed to fail.

Those who spoke at today's meeting included Zhou Peiyuan, Chai Zemin, Cao Keqiang, Ding Xuesong, Liu Chun, Yu Zhan, Huang Ganying, Kang Daisha, Li Ke, Gong Pusheng, Ding Guoyu, Yao Zhongming, Li Zewang, and Song Desen.

　　政协外事委员会召开会议
　　谴责美国会干涉我国内政
　　要求立即取消对华制裁的修正案
    新华社北京11月22日电　（记者张益俊、胡清海）全国政协外事委员会今天召开会议，通过一项关于美国国会通过制裁中国修正案的严正声明，对美国国会进一步干涉中国内政表示极大的愤慨和最强烈的谴责。
    外事委员会主任周培源讲了话，副主任柴泽民主持了今天的会议。
    委员们在发言中指出，中美关系目前面临着严峻困难，这完全是美国深深地卷入了中国的内部事务、干涉中国内政的结果，美国国会众、参两院最近分别通过的制裁中国的国务院授权法修正案，就是一个极好的佐证。
    他们认为，在中国平息反革命暴乱过后5个多月，事实真相已大白于天下的时候，美国国会的修正案却置基本事实于不顾，竟然提出要进一步对华进行制裁，这种强权政治和霸权主义行径只能暴露出他们自己的狂妄、无知和偏见，是对国际关系基本准则的肆意践踏，是恶化中美关系的严重步骤。
    委员们认为，中国政府依法采取措施，平息北京反革命暴乱，丝毫没有触犯美国的利益，倒是美国欠了中国人民的帐。现在，美国国会又一意孤行地通过了进一步制裁中国的议案，这是中国人民绝对不能接受的，“不能不引起我们最强烈的愤慨和抗议。”
    他们告诫美国国会，中国人民是有志气、有骨气、有民族气节的，是任何反动势力都吓不倒的，中国人民走社会主义道路的决心是不可动摇的。
    委员们再次奉劝美国国会不要把自己的社会制度和价值观念强加于中国人民，立即取消对华制裁的修正案，停止一切干涉中国内政、恶化两国关系的行径。
    他们认为，中国决不会拿原则做交易，如果认为通过几个所谓修正案，就能迫使中国屈服，动摇中国人民走社会主义道路的决心，那只能是痴心妄想，注定要失败的。
    在今天会议上发言的有周培源、柴泽民、曹克强、丁雪松、刘春、余湛、黄甘英、康岱沙、李克、龚普生、丁国钰、姚仲明、李则望、宋德敏等。
