The Navy's implementation of the planned management of cadres has shown good results. The statistics on the quantity and quality of cadres for 1989, which have just been completed, show that nearly 50% of military and political command cadres have undergone training at military academies at their respective levels. The age structure of senior, mid-level, and junior officers has formed a relatively reasonable progression. The cultivation, selection, evaluation, appointment, entry, and exit of cadres have all entered normal tracks.

Four years ago, the Navy fully implemented the planned management of cadres, treating the growth, training, promotion, adjustment, transfer, and retirement of cadres as an integrated whole. Using systems optimization methods, plans are uniformly compiled and issued annually in the form of indicators. Subordinate units at the fleet level and below formulate specific implementation plans. At the same time, strict procedures for drafting and modifying cadre management plans have been established.

Currently, the average age of leadership teams at various levels in the Navy's combat units has decreased by 4 to 6 years. The cultural structure of the cadre team has been significantly improved, and the degree of specialization has also been greatly enhanced. According to incomplete statistics, just the exchange of talents and the filling of vacancies for thousands of cadres has saved hundreds of thousands of yuan in training expenses, effectively reducing the pressure on local governments to place transferred military cadres.

　　海军实行干部计划管理收效好
　　平均年龄下降　军官素质提高
    据新华社北京11月22日电　海军实行干部计划管理制度效果好。刚刚结束的1989年海军干部数量、质量统计结果显示：目前近50％的军政指挥干部经过了军队院校的本级培训；高、中、初级军官年龄结构形成了比较合理的梯次；干部的培养、选拔、考核、任用、进出等走上了正常的轨道。
    4年前，海军全面实行干部计划管理制度，即将干部的生长、培训、晋升、调整、转业、离休等各项工作作为一个整体，按照系统优化方法统一编制出计划，于每年初以指标形式下达。舰队以下各级制定出具体的落实方案。同时，还建立了严格的拟制、修改干部管理计划的程序。
    目前，海军作战部队各级领导班子的平均年龄分别下降了4至6岁。干部队伍的文化结构得到较大改善，专业化程度也得到较大幅度提高。据不完全统计，仅人才交流、调余补缺数千名干部这一项，就可节约培训经费上百万元，还有效地减轻了地方政府安置军队转业干部工作的压力。
