South Korea announces the cause of the airplane crash on November 25
The accident was due to an engine failure

	Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 27th - According to a broadcast by the Seoul Radio Station, the investigation materials released by the South Korean Ministry of Transportation today indicate that the direct cause of the crash of a South Korean Airlines F-28 type passenger plane at Seoul's Kimpo Airport on November 25 was an engine failure.

	This passenger plane, which was flying on a domestic route within South Korea, crashed during takeoff at Kimpo Airport. Among the 52 passengers and crew members on board, more than 30 were injured.

	After the accident, the South Korean Ministry of Transportation's special investigation team for aviation accidents verified the flight recorder (black box). From the analysis of the sounds recorded on the flight recorder, it was found that both engines of the aircraft were operating normally during the takeoff roll, but a few seconds after leaving the runway, the left engine blades malfunctioned, causing the engine to fail.

	The special investigation team pointed out that after the aircraft left the runway at a speed of 144 kilometers per hour, it repeatedly fell back onto the runway, which was related to the pilot's improper operation.

　　南朝鲜公布25日客机坠毁原因
　　事故缘于飞机发动机故障
    新华社平壤11月27日电　据汉城广播电台报道，南朝鲜交通部今天公布的调查材料表明，25日南朝鲜航空公司一架F—28型客机在汉城金浦机场坠毁的直接原因是发动机发生故障。
    这架在南朝鲜境内航线飞行的客机是在金浦机场起飞时坠毁的，机上52名乘客和机组人员中有30多人受伤。
    事故发生后，南朝鲜交通部空难事故特别调查组对飞行记录仪（黑匣子）进行了验证。从飞行记录仪上记录的声响分析，这架飞机在滑行起飞时两个发动机运转正常，但在离开跑道几秒钟后左侧发动机叶片发生故障导致发动机运转失灵。
    特别调查组指出，飞机在以时速144公里飞离跑道后又多次回落跑道与驾驶员的驾驶不当有关。
