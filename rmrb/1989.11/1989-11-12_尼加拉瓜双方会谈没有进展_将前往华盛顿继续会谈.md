People's Daily, United Nations, November 10th - Correspondent Liú Kāichéng reports: According to an announcement made by the International Support and Supervision Committee this evening, the direct talks between the Nicaraguan government and the anti-government armed forces have adjourned for the evening at the United Nations headquarters and will resume on the 13th at the headquarters of the Organization of American States in Washington.

Over the past two days, the two sides have discussed the issues of resuming the ceasefire and the deadline for the repatriation of anti-government armed forces, but have not been able to reach an agreement. The representatives of the anti-government armed forces advocate for an immediate resumption of the ceasefire but do not discuss the issue of a deadline for repatriation. Instead, they demand that a safe zone be established within Nicaragua for the anti-government armed forces' base. The representatives of the Nicaraguan government, on the other hand, propose that only if the anti-government armed forces agree to be repatriated by the end of this year, can the ceasefire be resumed.

The heads of state of the five Central American countries reached an agreement in August this year in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, stipulating that the Nicaraguan anti-government armed forces would voluntarily repatriate by the end of this year, and the Nicaraguan government would hold national elections in February of the following year to elect a new government.

    尼加拉瓜双方会谈没有进展
    将前往华盛顿继续会谈
    本报联合国11月10日电　记者刘开宸报道：据国际支持与监督委员会今晚宣布，尼加拉瓜政府和反政府武装的直接会谈今晚在联合国总部休会，将于13日转到华盛顿的美洲国家组织总部继续举行。
    两天来，双方讨论了恢复停火和限期遣返反政府武装人员两个问题，意见相持不下。反政府武装代表主张立即恢复停火，但不谈限期遣返事，反而要求尼国内先划出一块安全区作反政府武装部队的基地。尼政府代表则提出只有反政府武装同意在今年12月以前遣返，才可恢复停火。
    中美洲5国首脑于今年8月在洪都拉斯的特拉城曾达成协议，规定了尼反政府武装在今年12月以前自愿遣返，尼政府则在明年2月举行全国大选，选出新政府。
