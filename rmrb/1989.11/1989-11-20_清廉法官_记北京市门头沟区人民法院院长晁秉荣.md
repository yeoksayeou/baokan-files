The Honest Judge
—Recalling the Chief Judge of the People's Court of Mentougou District, Beijing, Jia Bingrong

In July 1953, 22-year-old Jia Bingrong came to work at the People's Court of Mentougou District from Beijing. Over the course of 36 years, he has held positions including receptionist, clerk, judge, head of the civil court, deputy chief judge, and has been named an advanced worker, model, and red banner holder in the municipal and district court systems 8 times. In 1983, he took on the responsibilities of chief judge and party secretary of the People's Court of Mentougou District.

Upholding the Law with Integrity

During the trial process, as the chief judge, Jia Bingrong often encounters interference and pressure from society. However, he always pays attention to maintaining the dignity of the state's laws, viewing the desecration of the law as the greatest crime.

Once, during the trial of an economic dispute case involving the local Jingxi Baihui Company, the court discovered that the company manager, Shi Huixuan, and others had serious fraud issues. The court then dispatched 12 judicial personnel to conduct investigations, collecting over 70 pieces of evidence. After transferring these materials to the district public security bureau, they dispatched 5 more judicial personnel to assist in the investigation for 15 days, uncovering that Shi Huixuan used vile methods to defraud 200,000 yuan from a certain agricultural trade center in Henan Province.

For this fraud case, some judicial personnel only recognized it as an economic contract dispute. Jia Bingrong, however, stood firm against the pressure and interference, ultimately convicting Shi Huixuan of fraud and sentencing him to 6 years in prison. The court also returned the seized illicit funds and 19 color televisions purchased with the illicit funds to the victimized unit.

Nurturing Talent with Love

Jia Bingrong often says that building a strong judicial team is the foundation of the court's work.

In the People's Court of Mentougou District, 85.6% of the staff are middle-aged and young officials under the age of 40. Jia Bingrong highly values this force. During the New Year and Spring Festival periods each year, he and other court leaders visit the homes of the staff, inquiring about their well-being, understanding their difficulties, and helping to alleviate their concerns. During one home visit, he discovered that a staff member working in a mountain court had a very difficult family life, so he immediately worked with relevant departments to resolve the issue. This colleague was deeply moved and devoted himself to his work, being named an outstanding party member multiple times. Over the years, Old Jia has visited every home of staff living in the mountains, some of which he has visited multiple times. Young staff members say: Jia, the chief judge, is over fifty years old, yet he tirelessly visits our homes. What worries do we still have that we can't resolve?

Jia Bingrong also frequently provides political care and professional training to young staff members. In 1985, when the national court system opened a "law evening university," he took on the role of class advisor. Whenever it was time for classes, he would go to the classroom to check attendance and urge make-up classes; after class, he would wear his old glasses, stay up late, and correct the homework of over 30 students, writing detailed comments. With his help, all 34 students from the People's Court of Mentougou District graduated successfully.

Old Jia often finds time to chat with colleagues over tea and meals. He is straightforward and sincere, so everyone is willing to share their thoughts with him. In April of this year, social unrest affected the court. For this, Old Jia found time to talk with 32 colleagues in a short period, clarifying some of their vague understandings and maintaining the court's normal order.

Jia Bingrong also established regular thought analysis meetings, life self-examinations, summaries and evaluations, setting examples, and democratic consultations as institutional practices, maintaining them consistently. In 1986, they were the first in the municipal court system to establish a "thought and political education exhibition room," with lively forms and rich content. In September of this year, the Beijing Higher People's Court organized over 50 newly assigned college students to visit and learn from this exhibition room.

In recent years, some officials have been unable to resist the temptation of money and have violated party discipline and state laws. However, the People's Court of Mentougou District, which has relatively harsh living conditions and lower welfare benefits, has had no one request a transfer, no one punished for violating laws and discipline, and no one participating in the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots that occurred in Beijing. This is a vivid and practical test of Jia Bingrong's efforts in ideological and political work.

A Man of Integrity

Jia Bingrong lives in the city. For over 30 years, he has insisted on living and eating with everyone at the court, only returning home on weekends. A few years ago, the court acquired a small car, and it would take less than an hour to drive home. However, he insisted on taking the bus. The district committee leaders, considering Jia Bingrong's poor health and his high blood pressure and other illnesses, issued an order for him to take the small car home on weekends.

Jia Bingrong's family has many members, and their housing is quite cramped. In 1984, the court built a dormitory. Based on population, seniority, and position, Chief Judge Jia could have easily been allocated a three-bedroom apartment. However, he considered that many colleagues had housing difficulties and only took one room. Following his example, many colleagues in the court showed generosity, giving their housing to those in the greatest need.

Old Jia never interferes with his children's work arrangements. His eldest daughter is a kindergarten teacher, his second daughter is an accountant at a vegetable market, and his other two daughters work in a printing factory, while his son is an electrician. He always educates his children to focus on their own jobs. Last year, the municipal court assigned a quota for additional staff to the Mentougou District Court. During the selection process, 26 people approached Jia Bingrong, asking him to prioritize his children and relatives for positions in the court. Old Jia, however, insisted on principles and standards, declining everyone's good intentions.

Jia Bingrong strongly opposes the culture of eating and gift-giving. He has led judicial personnel in resolving disputes and difficult cases for many units and individuals. These units and individuals have tried every means to invite Old Jia for meals, but he has refused them all. He also refuses to accept any gifts. Some people, taking advantage of his absence, leave gifts at his home. He then returns the gifts to the units of the gift-givers, requesting that the unit leaders educate the gift-givers.

Jia Bingrong, with his exemplary actions, has earned the trust and affection of all the staff in the court. In April of this year, the district committee's organization department conducted a moral, ability, and performance assessment survey of officials, with 73 staff members participating. 70 people rated Old Jia as excellent, and 3 people rated him as competent.

    清廉法官
    ——记北京市门头沟区人民法院院长晁秉荣
    本报记者　苏宁
    1953年7月，22岁的晁秉荣从北京城里来到门头沟区人民法院工作。36年来，他担任过接待员、书记员、审判员、民庭庭长、法院副院长，曾8次被评为市、区法院系统的先进工作者、标兵、红旗手。1983年，他挑起了门头沟区人民法院院长、党组书记重担。
                    执法如山
    在案件审理过程中，作为法院院长的晁秉荣经常碰到来自社会的干扰和压力。但是，他时时处处注意保持国家法律的尊严，视亵渎法律为最大犯罪。
    有一次，法院在审理涉及本区京西百卉公司经济纠纷案件中，发现公司经理石惠轩等人有严重的诈骗问题，即先后派出12名审判人员进行调查，共取证70多份。他们将这些材料转交区公安分局后，又派出5名审判人员，协同调查15天，查明石惠轩运用卑劣手段，骗取河南省某农贸中心20万元巨款。
    对于这起诈骗犯罪案件，司法机关有的同志仅仅认定为经济合同纠纷。晁秉荣却顶住压力，排除干扰，最后以诈骗罪判处石惠轩有期徒刑6年，并且将追缴的赃款和用赃款购买的19台彩色电视机发还受害单位。
                    爱人育才
    晁秉荣常说，建设一支过硬的审判队伍，是法院工作的基础。
    门头沟区人民法院40岁以下的中、青年干警占85.6％。晁秉荣十分珍爱这支力量。每年元旦、春节期间，他和法院其他领导分别到干警家中走访，嘘寒问暖，了解困难，帮助解除后顾之忧。在一次家访中，他发现一名在山区法庭工作的干警家庭生活非常困难，便立即与有关部门研究，给予解决。这位同志深受感动，一心扑在工作上，多次被评为优秀党员。几年来，老晁走遍了每一户住在山区的干警家庭，有的还走过多次。年轻干警们说：晁院长年过半百，不辞劳苦地登门家访，我们还有什么思想疙瘩解不开？
    晁秉荣还经常对年轻干警给予政治上关心、业务上培养。1985年，全国法院系统开办“法律业余大学”，他担任了班主任。每到学习时间，他就到教室里检查人数，督促补课；下课后，他戴着老花镜，点灯熬夜，批改30多人的作业，并且认真写下评改意见。在他的帮助下，门头沟区人民法院的34名学员全部顺利毕业。
    老晁常常在茶余饭后找同志们谈心。他心直口快，待人诚恳，大家有什么心里话都愿意跟他说。今年4月，社会动乱波及法院。为此，老晁在不长时间内找了32位同志谈心，澄清了一些同志的模糊认识，保持了法院的正常秩序。
    晁秉荣还将定期分析思想状况，生活检讨会，总结讲评，树立典型，民主协商对话等，作为制度固定下来，持之以恒。1986年，他们在全市法院系统首先创办了“思想政治教育展览室”，形式活泼，内容丰富。今年9月，北京市高级人民法院曾组织新分来的50多名大学生到这个展览室参观学习。
    近几年，一些干部经不起金钱的诱惑而违犯党纪国法。但是，生活条件比较艰苦、福利待遇相对较差的门头沟区人民法院却没有人要求调动，没有人因违法乱纪而受到处理，没有人参与在北京发生的动乱和反革命暴乱。这都是对晁秉荣抓思想政治工作的生动、实际的检验。
                    一身正气
    晁秉荣家住城里。30多年来，他坚持在法院与大家同吃同住，只回家过周末。前几年法院添了小汽车，坐小车回家用不了一小时。但是，他坚持挤公共汽车。区委领导考虑到晁秉荣体弱，又患有高血压等疾病，便下达指示，一定要他周末乘小汽车回家。
    晁秉荣家里人口多，住房比较紧张。1984年，法院盖了宿舍楼。按人口、资历、职务等条件，晁院长完全可以分一套3居室住房。但是，他考虑到住房困难的同志很多，仅要了一间房子。在他的带动下，院里许多同志发扬风格，把住房让给最困难的同志。
    老晁对子女的工作安排从不插手。他的大女儿是托儿所保育员，二女儿是菜店会计，还有两个女儿是印刷厂工人，儿子是电工。他总是教育子女安心做好本职工作。去年，市法院给门头沟区法院下达了增干指标。在选调干部过程中，先后有26人找晁秉荣，要他将子女、亲属优先调入法院工作。老晁却坚持原则，坚持标准，谢绝了大家的好意。
    晁秉荣对吃喝、送礼风非常反感。他带领审判人员为很多单位和个人解决了纠纷和疑难案件。这些单位和个人想方设法请老晁吃饭，他都一一拒绝。对送来的礼品，他一律拒收。一些人趁他不在家，将礼品放在他家里。他就把礼品退回送礼人所在单位，请单位领导对送礼人进行教育。
    晁秉荣以自己的模范行动，赢得了全院同志的信任和爱戴。今年4月，区委组织部对干部进行德、能、绩考核民意测验，73名干警参加，对老晁评价为优秀的70人，评价为胜任的3人。
