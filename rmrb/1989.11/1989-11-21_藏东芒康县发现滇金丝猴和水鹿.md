	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Lhasa on November 20, a survey team has discovered a group of 260 Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys in eastern Tibet. The Yunnan snub-nosed monkey, also known as the black snub-nosed monkey, is covered with long, fine, black-brown fur. It is a first-class protected animal in China, previously known to inhabit only Yunnan and western Sichuan, with a population of only a few hundred. The water deer, also known as the black deer, gets its name from its preference for living near water. It is a large mammal and a second-class protected animal in China.
