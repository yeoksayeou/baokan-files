	“New Realism” Novel Discussion Meeting

    _Zhongshan_ and the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles _Literature Free Talk_ editorial department recently jointly held a “New Realism Novel” discussion meeting in Nanjing.

    Participants believed that, as new wave novels gradually become less popular with readers, the _Zhongshan_ magazine has, since its third issue this year, consecutively published _Born in Despair_, _Walking Out of Blue River_, _Heir of the Gu Family_, and _Ode to Freedom_ in a “group exhibition” format, which has been well-received by readers and attracted the attention of the literary criticism community. This is a rare and valuable phenomenon that plays a positive role in strengthening the connection between readers and literature. Some people believe that the emergence of new realism novels is a development and change of realistic literature in a new situation and new pattern, a necessary product called for by the times, indicating that the development of realistic literature has strong vitality.

    When discussing the characteristics of “New Realism,” some suggested that “New Realism” novels are in contrast to traditional realistic novels and should be understood from the perspectives of “new writing” and “new reality.” Others, through the analysis of specific works, believe that new realism is a combination of representation and re-creation, a product of the intersection of modernism and realism. Some propose that new realism is a return to naturalism, a stream-of-consciousness approach. Others believe that the emergence of new realism novels is a successful self-adjustment by a group of realistic writers after experiencing the impact and stimulation of the new wave. Some believe that new realism is an exploration of reality in a “phenomenological” sense by writers, making literature return to the secular world and society, a calm choice and recognition after experiencing various noises and disturbances. Some believe that new realism is a reaction against individualism, re-emphasizing literary value, placing people within the context of life, and no longer engaging in self-talk or stream-of-consciousness that is detached from time and space. Some compare traditional realistic novels with new realism works from the perspective of background dilution and storytelling, believing that new realism continuously changes the narrative direction of novels, and stories lack fixed meanings, instead providing multiple possibilities of life. When discussing the emergence of new realism, some believe this is a quiet “green revolution” in the novel community. Critics, editors, and responsible persons from two magazines in Jiangsu participated in the meeting.

　　“新写实”小说讨论会
    《钟山》与天津市文联《文学自由谈》编辑部近日在南京联合召开“新写实小说”讨论会。
    与会者认为，在新潮小说逐渐受到读者冷落的时候，《钟山》杂志社今年第三期起以“大联展”的方式接连发表了《绝望中诞生》、《走出蓝水河》、《顾氏传人》、《逍遥颂》等新写实小说，受到了读者的喜爱和评论界的注意，是难能可贵的，这对于强化读者与文学的联系有着积极的作用。有人认为新写实小说的出现，是现实主义文学在新的形势新的格局下的发展和变化，是时代呼唤的必然产物，表明了现实主义文学的这一发展有着强大的生命力。
    在谈到“新写实”的特点时，有人提出“新写实”小说是与传统写实小说相对而言，要从“新写”和“新实”两个层面上去理解；有人则通过具体作品的分析认为新写实是表现和再现的结合、是现代主义和现实主义相交的产物；有人则提出新写实是自然主义的复归，是生活流；还有人则认为新写实小说的出现是一批写实型的作家在新潮的冲击和刺激下，经过阵痛之后的一次成功的自我调整。有人认为新写实是作家对现实生活进行“现象学”意义上的一次探索，它使文学走向世俗、走向社会，是人们经历了种种喧嚣和骚动之后一次心平气和的选择和认同。有人认为，新写实是对个性主义的反动，重新重视文学价值，把人置于生活关系当中来表现，不再作脱离一切时空的自言自语和意识流。有人从淡化背景和故事化的角度比较传统写实小说和新写实作品一些差异，认为新写实不断改变小说的叙述方向，故事缺少固定的意义，而在于提供生活的多种可能性。在谈及新写实的发生时，有人认为这是小说界一次悄悄的“绿色革命”。江苏的部分评论家、编辑及两刊负责人参加了会议。
