The U.S. economy has maintained eight years of continuous growth, but the poverty problem in the United States continues to develop.

According to official statistics, civilian surveys, and some media reports, the new features of the current poverty situation in the United States are: the number of various types of impoverished people is increasing, the gap between the rich and the poor is widening, and the problem of child poverty is becoming more prominent.

The number of impoverished people is actually increasing. According to official U.S. materials, in 1978, 24.5 million Americans lived below the poverty line, and in 1988, this number increased to 32.5 million, meaning the number of impoverished people increased from 11.4% of the total population to 13.5%. However, according to estimates by U.S. experts on social issues, the number of people living below the poverty line may be 50 million, or about 1/5 of the total population. This is because: (1) in addition to those officially listed as impoverished, there are 4-8 million illegal immigrants from Latin America, whose incomes are far below the poverty line. (2) The number of unemployed people in the U.S., according to official statistics, is 6.6 million, but in addition to the officially counted unemployed, there are about 1.5 million people who have given up looking for jobs due to despair, and another 5 million employed people are doing temporary work and will eventually join the ranks of the unemployed. Therefore, the actual number of unemployed people in the U.S. is 13 million, and their living standards are very low.

Structural poverty and policy measures have widened the gap between the rich and the poor. Western media believe that social and economic inequality in the United States is a legacy of the Reagan administration. According to the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, from 1978 to 1987, 8% of the poorest 1/5 of American families became poorer, while 13% of the richest 1/5 became richer. Currently, the income of Americans who do manual labor, after adjusting for inflation, is at its lowest level since 1966, while the income of the highest earners has increased by 21% over the past nine years.

The U.S. labor union organization believes that the weakening of the traditional role of unions has exacerbated the gap between the rich and the poor. In 1960, the income of the bosses of large U.S. companies was 41 times that of ordinary workers, and in 1988, this gap widened to 93 times. Unions are unable to effectively protect workers' interests in labor negotiations, which has encouraged bosses to suppress workers' demands for wage increases.

The U.S. business community believes that the trend of global economic competition is driving changes in the structure of U.S. enterprises, that is, large companies often move their production bases to third-world countries with low labor costs, thereby creating conditions for U.S. domestic enterprises to lower wages and reduce employment opportunities for U.S. workers.

In addition, competition has pushed the U.S. industry to focus on relying on analytical skills, research and design skills, and management skills to improve product quality and reduce costs. This has led to a significant increase in the income of those who possess these skills and have received higher education, while the income of manufacturing and service industry workers has relatively decreased.

Harvard University economist Reich points out that all these factors combined have led to a widening income gap between Americans with more education and those with less education.

U.S. sociologists believe that the Reagan administration's policy of cutting social welfare spending has increased the difficulties of the poor. In just the 1981-1982 fiscal year, social welfare spending was reduced by $350 million, and a large number of poor people lost the opportunity to receive food stamps. The medical assistance that the poor originally enjoyed was also reduced, and this blow to the poor is an important factor in widening the gap between the rich and the poor.

The problem of impoverished children is more widespread and prominent, and impoverished children are a concept unique to the U.S. social system, referring to children in low-income and no-income families.

A survey by researchers Bain and Elwood at Harvard University in the U.S. shows that 20% of children nationwide live below the official poverty line. In 1987, 30% of children living below the poverty line lived in rural areas, 28% lived in suburban areas, and 9% lived in urban minority communities.

The reasons for the increase in impoverished children are: the increase in the number of single-parent families, the decrease in the income of two-parent families, and the increase in the poverty rate of families.

Recently, nearly 100,000 Americans marched and rallied in Washington, D.C., demanding that the government address the increasingly serious problem of "homelessness" and the housing shortage crisis for low-income individuals.

    美国贫困状况的新特点
    戴增义
    美国经济尽管保持了8年的持续增长，但美国的贫困问题仍在继续发展。
    据美国官方统计、民间调查和一些报刊揭露，美国当前贫困状况的新特点是：各类贫穷人数增加，社会贫富悬殊更大，少年儿童的贫困问题更加突出。
    贫困的人数实际上在进一步增多。据美国官方材料，1978年生活在贫困线以下的美国人为2450万人，1988年增加到3250万人，即贫困人数由占总人口的11.4％增加到13.5％。但据美国社会问题专家估计，生活在贫困线以下的人数可能有5000万，即占总人口的约1／5。这是因为：（1）在官方列为贫困者以外，还有400—800万来自拉美的非法移民，这些人的收入远低于贫困线。（2）美国的失业队伍据官方统计是660万，实际上在官方统计的失业者之外，还有约150万因谋职绝望而放弃找工作机会的“失去勇气的人”，另有500万在业人员是打短工的，迟早将加入失业大军。因此，美国失业者实际达1300万，他们的生活水平很低。
    结构性贫困化和政策措施造成的贫富悬殊扩大。西方报刊认为，美国社会经济不平等是里根政府的一项“遗产”。据美国众院筹款委员会说，从1978年到1987年，美国家庭中最穷的1／5中，有8％变得更穷，而最富的1／5中有13％变得更富。目前美国干体力活的人的收入在扣除通货膨胀因素后处于1966年以来的最低水平，相反，在收入最高的人中，9年来实际增加了21％。
    美国工会组织认为，工会传统作用的减弱加剧了贫富悬殊。1960年美国大公司老板挣的钱为普通工人的41倍，1988年，这种差距扩大为93倍。工会在劳资谈判中不能有效地维护工人利益，助长了老板遏制工人增加工资的要求。
    美国经济界认为，世界经济的竞争趋势，推动着美国企业结构发生变化，即大公司常常把生产基地转到劳动工资低的第三世界，从而给美国国内企业压低工资创造条件，又减少美国工人的就业机会。
    此外，竞争还推动美国产业界重视依靠分析技能、研究设计技能和经营管理技能来提高产品质量、降低成本。这使掌握这些技能、受过较高教育的人的收入得到较大提高；相反，制造业、服务业工人的收入相对地下降。
    哈佛大学经济学家赖克指出，这一切的影响集中起来就是受教育多的美国人同受教育少的人之间收入差别拉大。
    美国社会学家认为，里根政府削减社会福利开支的政策增加了穷人的困难。仅在1981—1982年度，社会福利开支就减少350美元，大批穷人失去了领食品券的机会，穷人原来享受的医疗保健补助被削减，这种对穷人的打击，也是扩大贫富悬殊的重要因素。
    贫困儿童的问题更加广泛而突出，贫困儿童是美国社会制度下特有的概念，指的就是在低收入和无收入家庭中的儿童。
    美国哈佛大学的研究人员贝恩和埃尔伍德的调查表明，全美有20％的儿童生活在官方的贫困线以下。1987年生活在贫困线以下的儿童中，有30％居住在农村，28％居住在近郊区，9％居住在城市少数民族聚居区。
    贫困儿童增多的原因在于：单亲家庭的数量增加，双亲家庭的收入下降和贫困家庭率上升。
