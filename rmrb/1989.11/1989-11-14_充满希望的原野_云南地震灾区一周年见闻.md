A year before the anniversary of the earthquake in Láncāng, Gěngmǎ, and Cāngyuán in Yunnan Province, reporters visited the three heavily affected counties: Láncāng Lahu Autonomous County, Cāngyuán Wa Autonomous County, and Gěngmǎ Dai and Wa Autonomous County. Although aftershocks still occur from time to time, the people here are calm, social order is good, and the work of rebuilding homes has made encouraging progress. The disaster-stricken land is full of hope.

The Laughter of the People of Zhànmǎpō

Zhànmǎpō, a mountain village of over 800 households of the Lahu people, is located at the epicenter of the major earthquake. The earthquake destroyed the homes of 628 households, claiming 287 lives and injuring 768 people. How is the village now? On a morning after the rain, we arrived to see people taking out mats and winnowing baskets to dry grain, with golden fields in front of every door. A group of playful children followed us, jumping and pointing, adding liveliness to the village.

Li Zhāyuē and Páng Shí Mèi, a middle-aged couple who married after the earthquake, are Lahu farmers. During the major earthquake, Li Zhāyuē lost his wife and a child, while Páng Shí Mèi lost her husband, a child, and two elderly relatives. Both were once overwhelmed with grief, but the army helped them build temporary shelters, and the government provided them with grain, relief funds, and daily necessities. With the constant encouragement of village cadres, they finally found the courage to live on. In January, they registered their marriage, forming the first new family in Zhànmǎpō after the earthquake. Since then, the couple has lived harmoniously with their seven family members. Páng Shí Mèi excitedly told us, "This year, our new family has a good harvest, and we have more to eat and use than before. We can live such a good life thanks to the Communist Party and socialism." Currently, there are 16 similar new families in Zhànmǎpō, all living happily. There are also seven or eight widows and widowers considering marriage.

In the village office, several Lahu villagers, including Qǐ Chéngchāng and Bái Láiyǒu, were excitedly discussing the changes in Zhànmǎpō. They told us: after the earthquake, when the village needed to repair the irrigation canal, the government immediately sent explosives and detonators; when they needed to build a road, the government sent an engineering team; the rotten wooden bridge over the Black River, which collapsed during the rainy season, has now been replaced by a permanent bridge; the damaged small hydropower station has been repaired, and water pipes will soon reach every household. To ensure that the water supply is connected before the earthquake anniversary, the village secretary, Luó Xiǎocái, has been working day and night on the mountain. The days of the people of Zhànmǎpō carrying water in bamboo tubes are about to end.

The Communist Party's "Best"

The county seat of Gěngmǎ was almost completely destroyed in the earthquake. Now, the preliminary work for rebuilding the county has been completed. A deputy county magistrate temporarily sent by the provincial government to oversee the reconstruction pointed to the blueprint and said to the reporter: "We will follow the construction procedures, first build the roads, then the buildings. It is estimated that by next January, the Beijing-aided Jingyun Nationalities School and the county hospital built with funds from the Federal Republic of Germany can start construction first."

The town of Měngshěng in Cāngyuán Wa Autonomous County, which was reduced to ruins by the earthquake, has now built rows of neat red-brick and gray-tile houses. Thirty-two households have already moved into new concrete-framed residences, and 76 more are hurriedly under construction. In this county's Yánshuài Town, out of 3,200 households, 2,000 had their homes completely collapsed, but now over 400 have moved into new homes. In the various mountain villages of the town, one often hears the song "Celebrating the New House." During the "Celebrating the New House" ceremony, the host and guests sit together by the fireplace, drinking water and singing beautiful Wa folk songs. They sing: "In the old society, disasters were unmanaged; in the new society, the earthquake is ruthless, but people are kind. Socialism is the best! The Communist Party is the best!"

"Science is a Life-Saving Pill"

The damage to agricultural production caused by the earthquake is immeasurable. However, this year, the disaster area did not experience a significant reduction in output. The three most severely affected counties are expected to maintain grain production, with Cāngyuán and Gěngmǎ even surpassing their historical highest production levels. At the same time, sugarcane, tea, rubber, and lacquer are also bountiful.

"Science is indeed a life-saving pill. If it weren't for the promotion of hybrid seeds, this year's food supply would have been a big problem," almost all grassroots cadres said this. The village of Fùbāng in Láncāng County, which faces Zhànmǎpō, has 780 mu of paddy fields that cannot be cultivated, resulting in a reduction of 130,000 kilograms of grain. However, due to the promotion of 320 mu of hybrid corn, the estimated yield is actually 5,000 kilograms more than last year. The town of Yánshuài in Cāngyuán County, which was leveled by the earthquake, promoted hybrid rice and corn, increased late-season crops, and increased grain production by 150,000 kilograms. Gěngmǎ County experienced a reduction in wheat, beans, corn, and some dry rice, with an estimated shortfall of about 3 million kilograms. However, the cultivation of double-crop hybrid rice alone increased production by 5 million kilograms.

Officials in Cāngyuán County told reporters that in the past, they also actively promoted hybrid rice, but the people were reluctant to plant it. This year is different; everyone is eager to buy seeds, and the new trend of scientific farming has finally reached the layered mountains of the Wa region. Next year, our county plans to produce 50 mu of hybrid rice seeds.

Market Trade Situation is Encouraging

The market is a mirror reflecting the economic situation. During the days of reporting in the disaster area, we visited three markets and shared the autumn joy with the Lahu, Dai, Wa, and other ethnic groups.

On October 28, the market day in Shàngyǔn Town, Láncāng, attracted about 20,000 people from dozens of ethnic groups within a hundred miles. Along the kilometer-long street, vendors selling meat, vegetables, and mountain products were densely packed, and there were nearly 200 meters of clothing stalls attracting groups of young men and women. Officials from the town's tax bureau said that since this year, the market supply of grain and meat on market days has exceeded last year's levels, market tax revenue has increased by about 100,000 yuan compared to the same period last year, and the transaction volume of the supply and marketing cooperatives has also returned to pre-earthquake levels.

According to relevant officials from these three counties, the overall market prices are currently stable. Compared to last year, the prices of grain, daily necessities, and agricultural production materials have remained the same, with only building materials and sideline products seeing price increases due to higher transportation costs and the influx of outside construction teams, which have significantly increased the market supply pressure.

Our Cadres Have Returned

It was frustrating to find cadres during the reporting in the disaster area. Going to the county, the county cadres were in the villages; going to the villages, the village cadres were in the fields. Sometimes, even after confirming by phone, they would still be absent upon arrival. The disaster area is in urgent need of reconstruction, and grassroots cadres are working as if one day is several.

The Party Committee of Fùbāng Township in Láncāng was recently rated as an outstanding grassroots party organization nationwide. One evening, reporters visited the home of the township Party Committee Secretary, Yáng Zhōnghéng. This was a simple oilcloth shed built on a large plot of land. Originally, many anti-earthquake shelters were built here, but later, other households gradually moved into new residences, leaving only his family. Yáng Zhōnghéng had gone to inspect the repair of civilian houses in the village three days ago. His wife, Li, a teacher at the township central primary school, received us. She said, "Not only do you not find him, but I can't find him either. In the past year, he has been running around, spending only two or three days at home each month. During the earthquake, his house was destroyed, and his child was only one year old, but he still couldn't see him for many days. This anti-earthquake shed was built by the army."

The night wind blew through the fence, bringing a chill. We advised her to rebuild the house, but she said she had mentioned it to her husband many times, and he always said to wait, prioritizing the people over the cadres. When we learned that all the relief supplies her family received were just a small box of biscuits, we were all speechless for a long time. Finally, she broke the silence and smiled, saying, "I believe that one day it will get better!" We stayed in Fùbāng for three days but never managed to see Yáng Zhōnghéng.

The grassroots cadres in the disaster area are indeed admirable. Officials in Cāngyuán County said that after the earthquake, the relationship between cadres and the masses improved, and people of all ethnic groups said that their own cadres had returned. Wherever the cadres went, the Lahu people eagerly offered them water and wine, and the Wa people busily prepared chicken rice, a scene that had not been seen in many years.

    充满希望的原野
    ——云南地震灾区一周年见闻
    新华社记者　王青海　周晓频　赵维
    云南省澜沧耿马地震一周年前夕，记者走访了澜沧拉祜族自治县、沧源佤族自治县和耿马傣族佤族自治县3个重灾县。虽然当前余震仍时有发生，但这里人心安定，社会秩序良好，重建家园工作也有了喜人的进展，灾区原野充满希望。
          战马坡人的笑声
    战马坡，这个800多户人家的拉祜族山村，位于大地震的中心。地震摧毁了全村628户人家的住房，夺走了287人的生命，造成768人重伤。如今这里怎么样了？一个雨霁日出的上午，我们来到这里，见人们纷纷抬出晒席、簸箕晾晒粮食，家家门前一片金黄。一群调皮的孩子紧跟着我们，蹦蹦跳跳，指指点点，给这个山村增添了生气。
    拉祜族农民李扎约和彭石妹是一对地震后新结合的中年夫妇。大地震中李扎约失去了妻子和一个孩子，彭石妹失去了丈夫、一个孩子和两位老人。他们都曾一度痛不欲生，是解放军帮他们盖起了临时住房，政府送来了粮食、救济款、锅碗瓢盆和衣服被盖。在村干部不断开导下，他们终于鼓起了生活下去的勇气。今年元月，两人登记结婚，组成了战马坡震后第一个合两家为一家的新家庭。从此，夫妻携手，一家7口人日子过得和和睦睦。彭石妹激动地对我们说：“新家今年粮食打得多，吃的用的比过去还好。能过上这份好日子，全托共产党和社会主义的福。”目前，在战马坡类似李扎约和彭石妹这样的新家庭已有16户，他们都过得安安乐乐。还有七八对鳏寡者也正在酝酿结合。
    在村公所文书罗成文家里，启成昌、白来友等几个拉祜族乡民正兴奋地谈论着战马坡的变化，他们告诉我们：地震后村里要修复水渠，政府马上送来炸药和雷管；要修路，政府派来了工程队；黑河上那座一到雨季就垮的烂木桥，如今政府已经修成了一座永久性桥梁；震坏的小水电站已修复，自来水管即将通到家家门口。为了抢在地震一周年前后接通自来水，村支书罗小才带着人已经在山上干了许多个昼夜。战马坡世世代代用竹筒背水吃的日子眼看就要结束了。
            共产党“西得蒙”
    耿马县城在地震中基本上被毁掉。现在，重建县城的前期工作已经完成。省政府临时派到这个县负责重建工作的一名代职副县长指着规划蓝图对记者说：我们将按基建程序进行建设，先修路，后建房。预计明年元月，北京援建的京云民族中学、联邦德国捐款兴建的县医院可以率先动工。
    被地震夷为一片废墟的沧源佤族自治县的勐省镇，已经建起一排排整齐的红砖灰瓦房。这个镇的街上已有32户搬进了钢筋混凝土结构的新居，还有76户正在加紧施工。这个县的岩帅镇3200户中，有2000户的房屋被全部震塌，现在已有400多户住上了新房。镇上的各个山寨里，常能听到“贺新房”的歌声。在“贺新房”时，主人和客人一起围坐在火塘边，边喝水酒，边唱起动听的佤调。他们歌唱：“旧社会遭灾无人管，新社会地震无情人有情。社会主义西得蒙（最最好）！共产党西得蒙！”
              “科技是颗救命丸”
    地震给农业生产造成的损害是难以估量的。然而，今年灾区不但没有出现大减产，受灾最重的这3个县，预计除澜沧保产外，沧源、耿马两县粮食总产量还将超过历史最高水平，同时，甘蔗、茶叶、橡胶、紫胶等经济作物也获得了丰收。
    “科技真是颗救命丸，如果不是推广杂交良种，今年吃饭可成了大问题。”几乎所有的基层干部都这么说。与战马坡遥遥相望的澜沧县富邦乡虽然有780亩水田不能种，预计减收13万公斤，但由于推广了320亩杂交玉米，算来算去，估产反而比去年多了5000公斤。被地震夷为平地的沧源县岩帅镇由于推广了杂交水稻和杂交玉米，增种了晚秋作物，粮食增产15万公斤。耿马县小麦、豆类、玉米和部分旱谷减产，合计少收约300多万公斤，可仅种双季杂交稻一项就增产500万公斤。
    沧源县的干部告诉记者，过去这里也积极推广杂交稻，可是群众就是不愿种。今年不一样了，个个争着买种，看来科学种田的新风终于吹进了层峦叠嶂的佤山。明年我们县计划制杂交稻种50亩。
        集市贸易形势喜人
    市场是反映经济状况的一面镜子。在灾区采访的日子里，我们赶了3个集市，与拉祜、傣、佤等各族群众分享了金秋的欢乐。
    10月28日，澜沧上允镇逢集，方圆百里的十几个民族约两万多人前来赶街，在长达1公里的街道两旁，卖肉、卖菜、卖山货的，摆得密密麻麻，集上还有近200米长的服装摊点，吸引着成群结队的青年男女。镇税务所的同志说，今年以来，赶集天粮食、肉类的上市量均超过去年同期，集市税收比去年同期增加约10万元，供销社成交额也恢复到了震前水平。
    据这3个县的有关同志介绍，目前市场物价总的是平稳的，与去年相比，粮食、日用品和农用生产资料价格持平，只有建材和副食品价格上涨，原因是运费提高，外来的包工队，给市场供应增加了很大的压力。
        我们的干部又回来了
    在灾区采访令人头疼的是找干部难。去县里，县里的干部下乡了，去乡里，乡干部进村了，进到村里，村干部又上山了。有时候电话里约好了的，可到了那里仍然扑个空。灾区百废待兴，基层干部是一天当做几天用的。
    澜沧富邦乡党委最近被评为全国优秀基层党组织。一天黄昏，记者访问了乡党委书记杨忠恒的家，这是一间盖在一大片空地上的一间简易油毛毡房，原先这里盖了许多防震棚，后来别的住户陆续搬进新居，只剩下了他一家。杨忠恒三天前下寨子检查民房修复工作去了，他妻子、乡中心小学的李老师接待了我们。她说：“别说你们找不着他，我都找不着他。这一年来他跑上跑下，一个月在家呆不过两三天。地震时家中房子被毁，孩子才一岁，也照样是多少天见不着他的面，这间防震棚还是解放军给搭的呢。”
    夜风透过篱笆墙袭来，阵阵寒意，我们劝她把房子重新修一下，她说她跟丈夫说过多少次，他总是说再等等，先群众后干部。当我们得知她家得到的所有救灾品仅是一小盒饼干时，都不禁一时语塞，良久，还是她打破沉默，笑笑说：“相信总有一天会好起来的！”在富邦住了3天，我们终于没有等到杨忠恒。
    灾区的基层干部的确是可敬的。沧源县的同志说，地震后干群关系融洽了，各族群众都说我们自己的干部又回来了。干部所到之处，拉祜族群众争着敬水酒，佤族群众忙着煮鸡肉饭，这可是多年未见的景象了。
