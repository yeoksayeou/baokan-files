The Changzhi Washing Machine Factory places the user first in its production and operations, aiming to ensure that users are happy when they buy, satisfied when they use, and confident when they need service. They absolutely do not want users to regret their purchases.

The factory pays close attention to product quality. In 1983, the Haitang brand washing machine received the provincial excellence award, and in 1988, it won the national quality award. Good products must be accompanied by good after-sales service. They have established an after-sales service system: products can be returned or exchanged within one month of purchase (including cases where the user requests a return or exchange for reasons not related to quality); products come with a 3-year warranty, and major components have a 5-year warranty; regardless of the user's location, on-site service is provided; every April is quality tracking service month, during which all sold products undergo a quality check; every July is quality service month, during which all products (including those outside the warranty period) can be serviced free of charge. This July marked the fourth quality service month for the factory. Maintenance personnel provided free maintenance for 101 users' washing machines, without charging the users a penny, but spending over 20,000 yuan on parts. The factory also regularly visits users to gather feedback on product quality and after-sales service. So far this year, they have visited over 1,200 users.

The Changzhi Washing Machine Factory educates its maintenance personnel to prioritize the user, strictly adhering to the after-sales service system. Last year, an elderly worker from Kashgar, Xinjiang, brought a Haitang brand washing machine from inland China. Due to improper use, a small part was damaged. After receiving his letter, the factory notified the maintenance service center in Taiyuan to handle the issue. Soon, a maintenance worker was dispatched to Xinjiang to repair the user's washing machine.

Sincere service has won the trust of users. Today, the social stock of Haitang brand washing machines has reached over 1.5 million units. The Haitang flower in the Taihang Mountains is blooming more vibrantly than ever.

    绝不让用户花钱买后悔
    边文
    长治洗衣机厂把用户第一的方针贯穿于生产经营之中，他们的目标是：用户买时高兴，用时称心，需要服务时放心，绝对不能让用户花钱买后悔。
    这个厂注意抓产品质量。1983年海棠牌洗衣机获得省优称号，1988年又获得国家质量奖。产品好，还要售后服务好。他们建立了售后服务制度：产品售出一个月内允许退换（包括不属质量问题，用户要求退换的）；产品保修3年，主要零部件保修5年；不论用户远近，一律上门服务；每年4月为质量跟踪服务月，对售出的产品实行一次质量跟踪，每年7月为优质服务月，凡是该厂产品（包括超出保修期的）均可免费保修一次。今年7月，是这个厂第4次优质服务月，维修人员对101位要求保修的用户的洗衣机进行了免费保修，没有收用户一分钱，却支出零件费2万多元。这个厂还定期走访用户，征求对产品质量和售后服务的意见。今年以来，共走访用户1200多次。
    长治洗衣机厂教育维修人员树立“用户至上”的思想，严格按售后服务制度办事。去年，新疆喀什的一位老工人从内地带去一台海棠牌洗衣机，由于使用不当，损坏了一个小零件。厂里接到他的来信后通知驻太原维修服务中心处理。很快，中心就派了一位维修员赶赴新疆，为用户修好了洗衣机。
    真诚的服务赢得了用户的信任。如今，海棠牌洗衣机社会保存量已有150多万台。太行山区的这朵海棠花越开越鲜艳。
