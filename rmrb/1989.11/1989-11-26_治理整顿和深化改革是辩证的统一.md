The article titled "Rectification and Deepening of Reform Are Dialectically Unified" was published on November 14th in the *Economic Reference News*. The following is an excerpt.

To deepen reform, certain objective conditions and a relatively relaxed economic environment are necessary. If social demand far exceeds supply, and if price reform is hastily implemented in conditions of commodity shortages and inflation, it will lead to panic buying and price surges. Therefore, to carry out price reform, demand must be reduced, supply increased, and inflation eliminated. These tasks are precisely the goals of rectification and adjustment. Only when rectification and adjustment achieve results will the conditions for price reform be met. The same logic applies to fiscal reform, financial reform, wage reform, and so on. In this sense, rectification and adjustment are also part of the reform process. The two are not contradictory.

One of the difficulties encountered in economic system reform is the cycle of "expansion—tightening—re-expansion—re-tightening." This cycle has hindered reform, causing it to oscillate between "decentralization—centralization—re-decentralization—re-centralization." A major reason for this is the failure to properly manage the balance of supply and demand, fiscal balance, credit balance, and industrial structure balance during economic development. The rush to build and reform has led to repeated severe imbalances in the national economy, necessitating repeated adjustments. Rectification and adjustment aim to rectify economic relations and guide the national economy towards a path of sustained, stable, and coordinated development. This is both the goal of rectification and adjustment and the goal of reform. Once the economy breaks free from the cycle of overheating and cooling, reform can escape the cycle of decentralization and centralization, advancing to a deeper level. One of the drawbacks of the old system is the excessive concentration of power. Reform aims to grant local governments and enterprises a certain degree of autonomy and flexibility. However, reform is a revolution, and for this complex and profound revolution to proceed smoothly, a highly authoritative command center is necessary. In the complex process of transitioning from the old to the new system, unforeseen situations may arise. The ability to both loosen and tighten controls, and to enforce orders, is essential for adapting to changes, minimizing mistakes, and preventing setbacks. If local governments use "flexibility" as an excuse to manipulate central policies, or even engage in market division and economic blockade, reform measures will be distorted and good intentions will yield bad results. Therefore, during rectification and adjustment, it is necessary to appropriately strengthen the central government's regulatory capabilities and improve macro-control to ensure the smooth progress of reform.

The communiqué of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee states: "Rectification and adjustment will not only create the necessary conditions for the deepening and healthy progress of reform but also require the support of reform." Whether eliminating fiscal deficits or increasing effective supply, ultimately, it is necessary to improve the economic efficiency of enterprises. Only by continuously deepening enterprise reform, perfecting previously implemented measures such as the enterprise contract responsibility system, and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of enterprise employees, can enterprise potential be tapped to achieve more output with less input. Furthermore, deepening and improving reforms in areas such as the fiscal contract system, financial system, and foreign trade contract system, and more effectively expanding foreign trade and economic and technological exchanges, are necessary supports for rectification and adjustment work.

In summary, without reform, the economy has no way out; without rectification and adjustment, reform cannot be deepened. The conclusion is: rectification and adjustment and the deepening of reform are dialectically unified.

### 治理整顿和深化改革是辩证的统一

    治理整顿和深化改革是辩证的统一
    11月14日《经济参考》发表评论员文章《治理整顿和深化改革是辩证的统一》，现摘录于下。
    要深化改革，必须有一定的客观条件和比较宽松的经济环境。如果社会总需求大大超过了总供给，在商品短缺、通货膨胀的情况下贸然进行物价改革，就会发生抢购和物价暴涨。因此，要进行物价改革，就要压缩需求，增加供给，消除通货膨胀，而这些工作正是治理整顿的任务。治理整顿取得了成效，价格改革的条件才会具备。财政改革、金融改革、工资改革等等也无不如此。从这个意义上来说，治理整顿也是改革。二者并不矛盾。
    经济体制改革遇到的困难之一就是跳不出“膨胀——紧缩——再膨胀——再紧缩”的怪圈。它困扰了改革，使改革陷入了“放权——收权——再放权——再收权”的循环中难以前进。一个重要原因就是在发展经济中没有很好掌握供求平衡、财政平衡、信贷平衡、产业结构平衡等经济规律，建设和改革急于求成，从而造成一次又一次的国民经济比例严重失调，被迫进行一次又一次的调整。治理整顿就是要理顺经济关系，使国民经济逐步走上持续、稳定、协调发展的轨道。这既是治理整顿的目标，也是改革的目标。一旦经济初步走出了冷热交替的“怪圈”，改革就能跳出放权和收权的循环，向更深的层次发展。旧体制弊端之一是权力过分集中，改革就是要让地方和企业有一定的自主权和灵活性。但是，改革是一场革命，要使这场复杂而深刻的革命顺利进行，必须有一个有高度权威的司令部。在新旧体制转换的复杂过程中，有可能出现种种始料不及的新情况，放得开，收得住，令行禁止，才能够随机应变，减少失误，防止挫折。如果各地以“灵活变通”之名，将中央政策为我所用，甚至搞市场割据和经济封锁，改革措施在执行中也会扭曲变形，好的初衷也会带来坏的结果。因此，在治理整顿中适当地加强中央的调控能力，加强和改善宏观控制，是保证改革顺利进行所必要的。
    十三届五中全会公报指出：“治理整顿不仅将为改革深入和健康地进行创造必要的条件，而且它本身也需要改革的配合。”无论是消灭财政赤字，还是增加有效供给，归根到底还是要提高企业的经济效益。而只有不断深化企业改革，完善过去已经实行的企业承包责任制等各项改革措施，最大限度地调动企业职工的积极性，才能够挖掘企业潜力，以较少的投入，创造较多的产出。此外，深化和完善财政包干体制、金融体制、外贸承包制等方面的改革，更有成效地扩展对外贸易和经济技术交流，也是对治理整顿工作必要的配合。
    总之，不改革，经济就没有出路；不治理整顿，改革就很难深化。结论是一句话：治理整顿和深化改革是辩证的统一。
