In the past, the people of Zhangye took the most pride in one pagoda and one Buddha.

The pagoda refers to the wooden pagoda located within Zhangye Middle School, which stands 32.8 meters tall and has nine levels. “Our Zhangye pagoda reaches up to the clouds!” the people of Zhangye would boast. The Buddha refers to the clay statue of the reclining Buddha Sakyamuni in the Great Buddha Temple, with a body length of 35 meters, shoulder width of 7.5 meters, and foot length of 5.4 meters. The people of Zhangye would boast, “The Buddha’s foot is taller than your house! Only Zhangye has a hall that can accommodate the Great Buddha.”

This time, when the reporters visited Zhangye, the people of Zhangye opened their eyes to the daily changes in their hometown. A Zhangye resident said today: “Was that just bragging? Now, the television tower in Zhangye City is 150 meters tall, what’s so special about that wooden pagoda! The Great Buddha Temple’s hall is big, but how can it compare to the ‘Ganzhou Market’ building? Even if you lay down 10 Great Reclining Buddhas, it would still be spacious!”

The “Ganzhou Market” is a comprehensive trade building that was completed and put into use on September 1, 1988. The total building area is 8,900 square meters, with approximately 600 state-owned, collective, and individual business owners renting stalls to do business. The entire building is bustling with activity. The daily turnover can reach 100,000 yuan. Such a large-scale market that combines local products and general merchandise, the reporter has not seen in the provincial capital of Lanzhou. Zhangye’s ambition is indeed great!

However, what is even more eye-catching is the vegetable and fruit wholesale market here. Zhangye City is already one of the key vegetable production bases in the country. Every autumn, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Lanzhou, and the surrounding large factories and mines all come here to pull winter vegetables, with cars lined up in long queues. The vegetables mainly exported by train are winter-stored cabbages and onions. In 1988, the total production of melons and vegetables reached over 320,000 tons, with a commercial volume of over 270,000 tons, sold to 22 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country. There are also locally processed dehydrated vegetables that are popular in foreign markets.

Among Zhangye’s melons and fruits, apples and pears are the best, and have been rated as national quality fruits. This fruit has pure white, crisp, and juicy flesh, and can be stored until the following May. Apples and pears are also a recent development, and now every year, customers come to place orders without interruption.

The development of the vegetable and fruit industry has injected vitality into Zhangye’s economy. In 1988, Zhangye City’s rural economic total income was 350 million yuan, an increase of 4.6 times compared to 1978. Over 10 years, the average annual growth rate was 18.7%, which is unprecedented in Zhangye’s history.

In ancient times, the Han Dynasty established a county and named it Zhangye, meaning “to extend the arms of China.” The people of Zhangye believe: if the economy does not flourish, how can we extend?

　　张掖蔬菜走天下
　　——“河西四郡”采访札记之三
　　本报记者　张述圣　新华社记者　曹永安
    过去张掖人最引为骄傲的是一塔、一佛。
    塔指现存于张掖中学内的木塔，高32.8米，共9层。“我们张掖古塔高到半天云里去了！”张掖人夸耀说。佛指大佛寺的泥塑释迦牟尼卧佛，佛身长35米，肩宽7.5米，脚长5.4米。张掖人夸海口，“大佛的脚比你家的房子高！能装下大佛的殿就张掖有。”
    这次记者到张掖，张掖人从自己家乡日新月异的变化中开了眼界，一位张掖人今天这样说：“那是胡侃么，如今张掖城里的电视塔高150米，那木塔算啥！大佛寺的殿大，咋比得上‘甘州市场’大厦，怕是一层躺10个大卧佛还宽展展的！”
      “甘州市场”是去年9月1日竣工使用的综合贸易大厦，总建筑面积8900平方米，大约有600多户国营、集体、个体商户，在此租赁柜台经商。整个大厦里熙来攘往，热闹得很。日成交额高达10万元。像这样大规模的集土产、百货为一室农贸市场，记者在甘肃省省城兰州也不曾见过。张掖的气魄果真大！
    然而最引人注目的还是这里的蔬菜、瓜果批发市场。张掖市已是全国蔬菜生产的重点基地之一。每到秋季，新疆、青海、兰州及张掖周围的大型厂矿都到这里拉冬菜，汽车排成长龙。火车外运的菜主要是冬贮包心大白菜和洋葱等。1988年瓜菜总产量达32万多吨，商品量为27万多吨，销往全国22个省、市、自治区。还有当地加工的脱水蔬菜，远销国外市场受到欢迎。
    张掖的瓜果中，苹果梨为最，曾被评为全国优质果。此果肉纯白细脆，汁多味甜，可以越冬贮藏至次年5月。苹果梨也是近几年发展起来的，现在每年来订购苹果梨的客户络绎不绝。
    蔬菜、瓜果业的发展，给张掖的经济注入了活力。1988年，张掖市的农村经济总收入3.5亿元，比1978年增长4.6倍，10年中，平均每年增长18.7％，这在张掖的历史上是不曾有过的。
    当年汉王朝设郡取名张掖，意谓“张中国之臂掖”。张掖人认为：如果经济不振，又依何而张呢？
