On the morning of November 15th, long queues formed at the ticket booth of the Nagoya City Comprehensive Gymnasium. Japanese spectators were most concerned about the China-Japan women's volleyball match, and the highest-priced 10,000 yen numbered tickets were in high demand.

At 6 PM in the evening, the match began. The score of the first set fluctuated greatly. The Chinese team started with a 2-0 lead but then lost 5 consecutive points, allowing the Japanese team to take a 5-2 lead. The Chinese team recovered 4 points, but the Japanese team scored 5 more points, leading 10-6. The Chinese team then scored 6 points with spikes, serves, and blocks, taking a 12-10 lead. However, Su Huijuan's hold and Xu Xin's spike errors allowed the Japanese team to tie the score again. The Chinese team scored 3 more points with two spikes and a block, winning the first set. In this set, the Chinese team scored 8 points with spikes, while the Japanese team scored only 2 points. Out of the Japanese team's total 12 points, 9 were due to the Chinese team's errors. Clearly, the Chinese team had a significant advantage at the net, and reducing errors would bring victory within reach.

In the second and third sets, the Chinese team maintained a lead in the score. Li Guojun's powerful spikes left the Japanese team at a loss. Zhou Hong, Xu Xin, and Li Yuming's serves disrupted the Japanese team's usually stable first pass, forcing them to resort to powerful attacks. The Chinese team scored directly multiple times with blocks, causing the Japanese team's spikes to become distorted and leading to repeated errors. The Japanese spectators' deafening cheers neither shook the Chinese athletes nor revived the Japanese team. The Chinese team won three consecutive sets.

The Japanese team's score in this match was significantly lower than in their matches against Cuba and the Soviet Union. The Japanese coach admitted that the Chinese team's high-quality serves prevented the Japanese team from playing to their full potential.

     从发球拚起
     ——中日女排比赛侧记
    11月15日早晨，名古屋市综合体育馆售票口前排起了长队。日本观众最关心中日女排比赛，最高价1万日元的对号票，购者踊跃。
    傍晚6点，比赛开始。第一局比分几次大起大落。中国队开局2∶0领先后，竟连丢5分，反被日本队以5∶2超出。中国队捞回4分后，日本队又连得5分，并以10∶6领先。中国队靠扣球、发球和拦网，一气又得了6分，以12∶10再度领先。但是，苏惠娟持球，许新扣球失误，又被对手追平。中国队两扣一拦得3分，拿下了第一局。这一局，中国队扣球得8分，日本队扣球仅得2分。日本队总共得的12分中，有9分是中国队失误所致。显然，中国队网上优势明显，减少失误便胜利在望。
    第二、第三局，中国队比分始终领先，李国君的重扣使日本队一筹莫展。周红、许新、李月明的发球，使向来一传稳健的日本队难以组织起有效的反击，被迫改打强攻。中国队拦网多次直接得分，使日本队扣球动作变形而不断失误。日本观众震耳欲聋的声援，既没有动摇中国运动员，也没能使日本队起死回生。中国队连赢三局。
    日本队这场比赛中的得分，大大低于与古巴和苏联队对阵时的得分。日本队教练承认，中国队的高质量发球使日本队没能打出自己的水平。　本报记者　于青
