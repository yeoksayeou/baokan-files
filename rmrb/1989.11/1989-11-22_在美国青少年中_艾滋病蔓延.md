The number of American teenagers infected with AIDS is increasing at an alarming rate. Sexual liberation and drug abuse are causing the disease to spread further. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed blood samples from 40 major city hospitals and found that in cities like Miami and New York, 1% of 15- to 16-year-olds are infected with the AIDS virus, and 3% of 21-year-olds are infected. The American College Health Association conducted blood sample surveys at 19 schools last year and found that among college students, one in every 500 is an AIDS virus carrier. Dr. Weibelman, director of the Adolescent Clinic at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Francisco, said, "Without a vaccine, AIDS will undoubtedly spread among teenagers in the 1990s."

Surveys show that while there are only over 400 cases of AIDS among 13- to 19-year-olds, there are more than 5,000 cases among 19- to 24-year-olds, most of whom were infected during their teenage years. Researchers emphasize that judging by clinical cases alone and assuming that there are few teenage AIDS patients is a mistake, because the disease has a 7-year incubation period. Most teenagers with AIDS do not know they have been infected.

　　在美国青少年中
　　艾滋病蔓延
    美国感染艾滋病的青少年正以惊人的数量增加，性解放和滥用毒品，使艾滋病呈现进一步泛滥之势。美国疾病控制中心从40家大城市医院采集血液标本分析的结果表明，在迈阿密和纽约等城市，15至16岁的少年中，感染艾滋病毒的占1％，21岁者则有3％感染了艾滋病毒。美国大学保健学会去年对19所学校进行了血液抽样调查。结果发现，在大专院校内每500名学生中，就有一人为艾滋病毒携带者。旧金山凯泽医学中心青少年诊所所长威贝尔斯曼说：“如果没有疫苗，到九十年代艾滋病无疑将会在青少年当中泛滥。”
    调查表明虽然在13至19岁青少年中，只有400多例艾滋病，但19至24岁这个年龄却已经发现了5000多例，其中多数在少年时期就染上了病毒。研究人员强调，只看临床病例，就以为青少年艾滋病患者不多，其实是一个错误，因为病症有7年的潜伏期。青少年艾滋病问题中，多数人在传染上艾滋病毒后自己还不知道。
