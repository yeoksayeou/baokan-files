People's Daily, Nanning, November 5th. Reporter Jiang Yaqiang reports: In recent years, the court system in Nanning City has strengthened its internal anti-corruption efforts, ensuring impartial adjudication and strict enforcement of the law.

Refusing Gifts: In a property dispute case decided by a local court, the plaintiff, fearing an appeal, delivered 500 yuan in cash to the home of Nanning Intermediate People's Court President Wang Yanhua. Wang Yanhua promptly returned the money without hesitation.

Rejecting Interventions: The courts at various levels in Nanning City adhere to the principle of independent judicial adjudication, firmly resisting interventions from all directions. During the trial of a contract dispute between a company from a certain county in Hainan Province and the external dining department of Nanning Hotel, the defendant, through acquaintances, attempted to influence the court leadership and the handling personnel. The court leadership upheld justice, ensuring that the dispute was resolved in accordance with the law.

According to incomplete statistics, from January to September this year, the court system in Nanning City refused 111 instances of monetary gifts totaling approximately 18,000 yuan, declined 134 invitations to dine, and rejected 203 instances of intervention.

    送礼不收　说情不理
    南宁市法院廉洁执法
    本报南宁电　记者蒋耀强报道：近几年来，南宁市法院系统加强自身廉政建设，确保了秉公办案、执法刚正。
    送礼不收。一起房屋纠纷案的当事人在基层法院判决后，害怕对方上诉，将500元现金送到了南宁市中级人民法院院长王宴华家里。王宴华毫不犹豫地把钱退回去。
    说情不理。南宁市各级法院坚持依法独立审判的原则，对来自上下左右的说情坚决顶住。法院审理海南省某县一家公司诉南宁饭店外餐部合同纠纷一案，刚开始审理，被告方就通过熟人，找法院领导和承办人说情。法院领导秉公办案，使纠纷依法得到解决。
    据不完全统计，今年1至9月，南宁市法院系统拒收财礼111次，折合人民币约1.8万元，拒绝吃请134人次，拒绝说情203人次。
