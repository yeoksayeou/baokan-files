The Supreme People's Procuratorate held a telephone conference today to commend the advanced units in the procuratorial system nationwide for stopping turmoil and quelling counter-revolutionary riots. The Changping County People's Procuratorate in Beijing and 11 other units were awarded commendations, while the Criminal Prosecution Division of the Xuzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate and 38 other units were named "Advanced Units."

During the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, the Changping County People's Procuratorate in Beijing had no officials participating in parades or support activities. They stood their posts, performed their duties conscientiously, maintained social order, and actively participated in the struggle to stop the turmoil and quell the counter-revolutionary riots.

Other units that received commendations include the People's Procuratorates of Daxing County, Shijingshan District, and Shanghai City in Beijing, Yangpu District and Huangpu District in Shanghai, Ganzhou City, Wuchang District in Wuhan City, Guilin City, Xiangtan City, the Office of the Hubei Provincial Procuratorate, and the Technical Division of the Shaanxi Provincial Procuratorate.

In his speech at the meeting, Liu Fuzhi, the Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said that in the struggle to stop the turmoil and quell the counter-revolutionary riots, the procuratorial organs and the broad masses of procuratorial personnel across the country have firmly and clearly supported the wise decisions of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission. They have obeyed orders, followed commands, strictly observed discipline, and conscientiously performed their duties. They have resolutely and promptly cracked down on counter-revolutionaries and those involved in serious criminal activities such as beating, smashing, looting, arson, and murder. They have made due contributions to stopping the turmoil, quelling the counter-revolutionary riots, and maintaining national security and social stability. He said that the advanced units being commended this time are outstanding representatives that have emerged in the struggle.

Liu Fuzhi hopes that all levels of procuratorial organs and the broad masses of procuratorial personnel will learn from and follow the example of the advanced units, strive to catch up with and surpass them, and make new contributions to the Party and the people.
