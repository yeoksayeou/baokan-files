    Chongqing agriculture discovers a "new continent"
    Cultivates regenerated rice with an annual yield of over 200 million kilograms

    Editor's Note: The development of regenerated rice to increase grain production in Chongqing through the use of scientific technology is exciting. It is understood that in southern China, there are more than 20 million mu of paddy fields suitable for the development of regenerated rice. It is hoped that the comrades in these places will pay attention to Chongqing's experience. The significance of Chongqing's experience is not limited to this. It tells us that the potential of agriculture is great. As long as we attach importance to science and technology and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of scientific research and technical personnel, every place can discover its own "new continent."

    Xinhua News Agency reporter Xiang Hu reported from Chongqing on November 24: Chongqing City this year cultivated 2.5 million mu of regenerated rice, achieving a bumper harvest. The average yield per mu increased from 80 kilograms last year to 100 kilograms, with a total yield of over 200 million kilograms. This has made a significant contribution to Chongqing's grain production, which has been stagnant for four years. After inspecting the regenerated rice harvesting in Yongchuan, Bishan, and Ba County, Yang Ruidai, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, exclaimed: You have discovered a "new continent" by relying on science and technology!

    Regenerated rice utilizes the dormant buds on the rice stubble after harvesting to grow and develop again, resulting in a second harvest of rice. Farmers in the suburbs of Chongqing have cultivated it before, but the yield of regenerated rice cultivated by traditional methods is low and the harvest is uncertain.

    In 1984, the agricultural department of Chongqing organized experts from Southwest Agricultural University and agricultural research institutions to cooperate closely, applying systems engineering principles and electronic computers to study the cultivation of regenerated rice. They selected rice varieties with strong regeneration ability and conducted large-scale multi-point field trials, exploring a set of standardized cultivation techniques. Various levels of government have attached importance to the promotion of this technology, gradually expanding the area of regenerated rice and increasing the yield year by year. In 1986, the area of regenerated rice was 237,000 mu. In 1988, it expanded to 1.66 million mu, with an average yield of 80 kilograms per mu. This year, a new record was set.

    Generally, regenerated rice retains winter water fields, does not need to be plowed, does not require seeds, does not need to be transplanted, and only needs to add 10 kilograms of urea per mu and three to four laborers to produce several hundred kilograms of rice, which is very welcome to farmers.

    Sichuan Province has more than ten million mu of winter water fields. It is understood that Sichuan Province will promote regenerated rice across the province next year.

### 重庆农业发现“新大陆”　培育再生稻年产两亿多公斤

　　重庆农业发现“新大陆”
　　培育再生稻年产两亿多公斤
    编者按：重庆市运用科学技术发展再生稻增产粮食的事，令人兴奋。据了解，在我国南方，适宜发展再生稻的水田有2000多万亩，希望这些地方的同志注意重庆的经验。重庆经验的意义还不止于此，它告诉我们，农业的潜力是很大的，只要重视科学技术，充分调动科研、科技人员的积极性，各地都可以发现自己的“新大陆”。
    本报重庆11月24日电　新华社记者向虎报道：重庆市今年培育的250万亩再生稻喜获丰收，平均亩产由去年的80公斤提高到100公斤，总产2亿多公斤，为重庆粮食突破4年徘徊立下汗马功劳。中共中央政治局委员、四川省委书记杨汝岱去重庆市永川、璧山、巴县等地察看再生稻收割情况后，赞叹说：你们依靠科学技术，发现了一块“新大陆”啊！
    再生稻是利用水稻收割后稻桩上的潜伏芽生长发育，再收获一次稻谷的水稻。重庆市郊农民过去就有人培育过，但是土法培育的再生稻产量低，收成没把握。
    1984年，重庆市农业部门组织西南农学院和农业科研部门的专家，紧密合作，应用系统工程原理和电子计算机，研究再生稻种植，选出了再生能力强的稻种，进行了大规模的多点田间试验，探索出一套规范栽培技术。各级政府都重视推广这项技术，使再生稻面积逐年扩大，产量逐年提高。1986年再生稻面积23.7万亩。1988年扩大到166万多亩，平均亩产80公斤。今年更创新记录。
    留蓄再生稻一般是利用冬水田，不再犁耙，不要种子，不必栽秧，一亩只需增施10公斤尿素，花三四个工，就能多产几百斤稻谷，农民很欢迎。
    四川全省冬水田上千万亩。据了解，四川省明年将在全省范围推广再生稻。
