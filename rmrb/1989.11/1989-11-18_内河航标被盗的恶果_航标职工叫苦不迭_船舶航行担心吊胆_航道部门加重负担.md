In recent years, with the development of science and technology in China, the traditional navigation aids that used matches to light oil lamps have gradually been replaced by advanced solar-powered navigation aids. Due to the high cost of these aids, some lawbreakers have taken advantage of the situation to steal and destroy navigation aids, removing batteries and reselling them on the black market for profit.

According to statistics from relevant departments, last year, there were over 300 incidents of navigation aid theft in the Wuhan, Jiujiang, and Anqing sections of the Yangtze River. In Sichuan, along the 140-kilometer stretch from Dongyangzi in Yunyang County to Shunxi in Zhong County, there were over 40 cases of battery theft from navigation aids last year. In the 170-kilometer stretch of the Yangtze River from Huangjin in Hubei's Qichun County to Huayang in Jiangxi's Lianhua, nearly 12 survey markers were completely dismantled in the past three years, and the remaining 90% were damaged to varying degrees, resulting in economic losses of nearly 80,000 yuan. In Guangxi, there are over 4,000 navigation aids and 2,600 navigation lights. In recent years, there have been over 400 theft cases each year, resulting in economic losses accounting for about 25% of the annual national navigation aid business funds allocated. Major rivers in China, such as the Pearl River, Heilongjiang River, and the Grand Canal, frequently experience navigation aid theft incidents. Despite the efforts of navigation workers to guard the aids day and night, they remain vulnerable to theft.

The cost of a single navigation aid ranges from a few hundred to several thousand yuan, placing a heavy economic burden on the navigation departments, who are deeply troubled. According to the Chongqing Navigation Division, the Chuanjiang River has over 2,000 navigation aids, 70% of which are floating aids. Each floating aid is worth between 4,000 and 7,000 yuan, and approximately 120 are destroyed each year, resulting in economic losses of over 100,000 yuan.

The large-scale theft and destruction of navigation aids have made it difficult for vessels to navigate, leading to an increase in accidents. We urge relevant departments to severely crack down on the criminals stealing navigation aids and ensure the safety of vessel operations.

### 内河航标被盗的恶果——航标职工叫苦不迭  船舶航行担心吊胆  航道部门加重负担

    内河航标被盗的恶果——
    航标职工叫苦不迭  船舶航行担心吊胆  航道部门加重负担
    近几年来，随着我国科学技术的发展，过去用火柴点燃油灯的航标逐步被先进的太阳能电池航标所取代。由于这种航标价格昂贵，一些不法分子伺机进行盗窃，拆毁航标，盗走电瓶，在黑市转手倒卖，从中牟利。
    据有关部门统计，去年，长江万县、监利、武汉、九江、安庆航段发生了三百多起航标被盗案件。四川云阳东洋子至忠县顺溪一百四十多公里航道，去年仅盗窃航标电瓶案一项就达四十多起。湖北蕲春县黄颡口至江西华阳浏口一百七十多公里长江航道，近三年有十二座测量标被全部拆走，其余的百分之九十均有程度不同拆损，经济损失近八万元。广西全区有航道导航标志四千余座，航标灯二千六百余座（盏），近几年，每年发生被盗案都在四百起以上，经济损失占国家每年下拨航标业务费的百分之二十五左右。我国的珠江、黑龙江、大运河等主要河流，均经常发生航标被盗案件。尽管航标工人日夜看守，仍防不胜防。
    一座航标少则几百元，多则几千元，航道部门经济负担太重，深感头痛。据重庆航道分局反映，川江航道有航标二千余座（盏），其中百分之七十是浮标，每座浮标价值四千至七千元，每年约有一百二十座以上被拆毁，经济损失达十万元以上。
    航标大量被盗被毁，使船舶航行常常辨不清方向，事故日益增多。呼吁有关部门严厉打击盗窃航标的犯罪分子，保障船舶航行安全。
