The external affairs secretary of the Azanian Pan Africanist Congress, Gora Ibrahim, pointed out today that the five-year reform plan proposed by South African President de Klerk will not change the notorious South African racial discrimination system.

Ibrahim made these remarks in an interview with our reporter. He said that as long as the five political pillars of the apartheid system are not abolished, South Africa's apartheid system will not change. These five pillars include the Population Registration Act based on race, the law that allows a minority of whites to own 87.3% of the land, the Bantu Education Act that promotes the superiority of the white race, and the existing parliamentary system.

He said that the South African authorities were forced to announce the so-called reform plan due to the "serious domestic crisis" they are currently facing, the impact of international economic sanctions, and the burden of a $29 billion foreign debt.

Ibrahim said that the current release of some political prisoners and the permission to hold peaceful rallies by the South African authorities are aimed at easing international sanctions against the South African authorities, rather than eliminating the five political pillars of apartheid.

    阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会领导人
    呼吁根除种族隔离体系
    新华社联合国10月30日电  （记者钱文荣、杨跃华）阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会外事书记戈拉·易卜拉欣今天指出，南非总统德克勒克提出的一项所谓5年改革计划不会改变臭名昭著的南非种族歧视体系。
    易卜拉欣是在接受本社记者采访时说这番话的。他说，只要种族隔离体系的五大政治支柱不废除，南非的种族隔离体系就不会有变化，这五大政治支柱包括按种族登记人口法、少数白人占有87.3％的土地法、鼓吹白人是优等民族的班图教育法和现存的议会制度。
    他说，南非当局之所以被迫宣布所谓的改革计划是由于南非当局目前面临“严重的国内危机”、国际经济制裁的影响和290亿美元的外债的重担。
    易卜拉欣说，南非当局目前释放一些政治犯和允许举行和平集会，目的是想减轻国际上对南非当局的制裁，而不是根除种族隔离的五大政治支柱。
