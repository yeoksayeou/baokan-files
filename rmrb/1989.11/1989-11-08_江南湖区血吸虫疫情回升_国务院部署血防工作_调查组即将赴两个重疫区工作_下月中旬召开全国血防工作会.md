Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 7th.

The blood fluke epidemic in the southern lakes region is resurging, with 373 counties affected. Among these, 110 are severely affected, with approximately 500,000 cases reported (considering a 50% underreporting rate, the actual number of cases is estimated to be around 1 million), including 40,000 advanced cases. The severely affected area spans 34 billion square meters, putting over 100 million people at risk, with the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu being the most severely impacted.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council are highly concerned about this serious situation. In mid-September, General Secretary Jiang Zemin issued important instructions regarding the outbreak of acute infection cases in Wuhan, Hubei Province, stressing the need to take effective measures to control the spread of the epidemic and requesting timely reports. On October 11, Vice Premier Li Tieming specifically listened to a report on blood fluke prevention work and presided over a meeting to study and implement measures. It was confirmed that to effectively address blood fluke prevention, planning, legislation, joint efforts between central and provincial governments, comprehensive treatment, organizational structure, and reliance on the masses must be combined. The central government and local authorities should formulate a five-year plan for blood fluke prevention, set goals, and clarify the division of responsibilities between the central and local governments. The provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu should jointly draft a plan for treating the lake areas, and the Ministry of Health should formulate blood fluke prevention regulations.

Today, a meeting was held with relevant officials from the Ministries of Agriculture, Water Resources, Personnel, Finance, Chemical Industry, and Health, who were tasked by the State Council to discuss the action plan for the investigation teams that will depart on November 12 to the two severely affected blood fluke regions in Hunan-Hubei and Jiangxi-Anhui. Each team consists of two ministers and two bureau-level officials, preparing for the high-level national blood fluke prevention conference scheduled for mid-December in the severely affected areas.

    江南湖区血吸虫疫情回升
    国务院部署血防工作
    调查组即将赴两个重疫区工作
    下月中旬召开全国血防工作会                      
    本报北京11月7日讯  记者艾笑报道：今天，由国务院责成的农业、水利、人事、财政、化工、卫生等6部委有关负责人聚会研究了将于本月12日分赴湘鄂和赣皖两个血吸虫重疫区工作的调查组行动计划。这两个各有两位部长和两位司局长参加的调查组，是为将于今年12月中旬安排在重疫区召开的高层次全国血防工作会议做会前准备的。
    据了解，最近几年我国江南湖区血吸虫疫情正在回升，已有373个县正在蔓延。其中，重疫县110个，已发现病人50万（考虑50％的漏报率，实际病人数约计100万），晚期病人4万。重疫区面积34亿平方米，危及人口1亿多，其中以处于长江中游的湖南、湖北、江西、安徽、江苏5省尤甚。
    党中央、国务院十分重视这一严峻形势。9月中旬江泽民总书记曾就湖北武汉市发生大批急性感染病人一事，作了重要批示，要求采取有效措施，控制疫情蔓延，并嘱：“随时见告”。国务委员李铁映10月11日专门听取了血防工作问题的汇报并主持研究落实措施。确认做好血防工作必须把制定规划、加强立法、部省联合、综合治理、组织队伍和依靠群众结合起来，国家和地方要制定今后5年的血防工作规划，确定奋斗目标，明确中央和地方的分工职责。湖南、湖北、江西、安徽、江苏5省要联合拟订治理湖区血防规划，卫生部制定血防法规。
