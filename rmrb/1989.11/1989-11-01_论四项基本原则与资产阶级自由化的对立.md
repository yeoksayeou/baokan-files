The turmoil of this spring and summer not only reflected the sharp contradiction between the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization but also was the result of the long-term development of this contradiction. Its occurrence was not accidental. Therefore, in celebrating the 40th anniversary of the People's Republic and summarizing the 40 years of experience in socialist construction, we must consider the issue in the context of this contradiction. Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech on National Day, from beginning to end, is imbued with the spirit of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, reflecting a profound, historical, and scientific understanding of the fate of China's socialist cause, the future of China's socialist modernization construction, and the reform and opening up.

I. On the Historical Experience of Forty Years

Every upright Chinese person will feel that since the founding of New China, the Chinese Communist Party has led the Chinese people through a very bumpy yet glorious path. The external conditions for our construction were not favorable. For a considerable period, there was isolation, blockade, subversion, and interference from hostile foreign forces. Even today, they have not abandoned their attempt to implement "peaceful evolution" against our country. Domestic factors were also unfavorable. Our economy and culture were relatively backward, and the old China left behind a mess of ruins. From leadership to the masses, there was a lack of sufficient knowledge and preparation for building a modern civilization, and a lack of experience in building a new life. Therefore, the socialist revolution and socialist construction could not be anything but a process full of complex struggles, arduous explorations, repeated setbacks, and constant overcoming of "leftist" or rightist errors. Over the past 40 years, while achieving great achievements that have attracted worldwide attention, we have also experienced the hardships of entrepreneurship and exploration. The socialist cause is unprecedented. This process has proven that the Chinese Communists are true pioneers of history; it has shown the unyielding spirit of struggle and boundless creativity of the great Chinese people.

In the first 30 years of exploration, we made considerable progress under extremely difficult conditions. It is this progress that laid the foundation for the development of the past 10 years. We cannot sever history. We cannot ignore or belittle the progress made in this period just because it is far in the past and because errors were made. As Comrade Jiang Zemin said, the great achievements since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee are also the further development of the achievements of socialist revolution and construction in the first 30 years of New China. Of course, many errors were made in this period, especially in the latter 20 years. The main errors were "leftist" errors, such as rushing for quick results in the economy, exaggerating class struggle in the analysis of the situation and work guidance, and even proposing to "take class struggle as the key link." Due to the continuous focus on class struggle and political movements, on the one hand, it affected the shift of the work focus and failed to concentrate on economic construction, causing us to miss many good opportunities and widening the gap with developed countries in economic and technological development. On the other hand, due to the expansion of class struggle, many good people were harmed, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses, especially intellectuals, was dampened.

In the past 10 years, a major turning point has occurred in China's history, entering a new historical period. Its fundamental characteristic is the correction of the error of "taking class struggle as the key link" and shifting the focus of the entire Party and the country to economic construction and the development of productive forces. The correctness of this shift in focus and the new policies have been verified by the rapid development and great achievements in the economy and culture over the past 10 years.

A notable phenomenon is that in the first 30 years, almost every day was spent fighting the right and talking about class struggle, resulting in serious "leftist" errors. In the past 10 years, the Party's line has been correct, and the entire Party and the people have concentrated on economic construction. However, the trend of bourgeois liberalization has gradually developed, and some leading comrades have made mistakes in supporting this trend. It seems that this phenomenon is not accidental and must be scientifically analyzed so that we can have a more comprehensive and profound understanding of historical experience. Almost at the same time as the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee decided to shift the focus of work and formulated new policies for economic development and reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, on behalf of our Party, raised the issue of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles: adhering to the socialist road, adhering to the people's democratic dictatorship, adhering to the leadership of the Communist Party, and adhering to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The Four Cardinal Principles are not new; they are what our Party has consistently upheld. However, in the new period, they were emphasized and put forward for historical reasons and new needs. This is because, in the process of rectifying the past and looking to the future, the trend of doubting and denying the Four Cardinal Principles, that is, the trend of bourgeois liberalization, took the opportunity to develop. And while we were wholeheartedly engaged in economic construction and reform and opening up, this trend surged again and again, becoming an important factor in disrupting and sabotaging our socialist cause. The formation of this situation is the responsibility of a few stubborn individuals who insist on and crazily advocate bourgeois liberalization, and of some leading comrades who passively or actively support and encourage bourgeois liberalization. However, generally speaking, the existence and development of this erroneous trend and reactionary current in the new period have their historical necessity.

In a word, the contradiction between the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization is a phenomenon that will necessarily exist for a long time in our socialist modernization construction after basically overcoming "leftist" errors. Ten years of practice has enabled us to reach this understanding, and therefore we must be prepared for this contradiction in the long term.

II. Why This Contradiction Necessarily Arises

Fundamentally, this contradiction is determined by the historical position of Chinese socialism. In terms of the general nature of this contradiction, it can even be said that it is determined by the historical position of contemporary socialism.

The great October Revolution of 1917 was the most significant event of the 20th century. Since then, human history has begun the transition from capitalism to socialism and communism. It is worth noting that the socialist system was not established in the most developed regions of capitalism. China is an economically and culturally backward country with very underdeveloped capitalist relations. In countries with highly developed social economies and capitalist relations, socialism has not yet been established. Many people believe that this phenomenon deviates from the laws of social development analyzed by Marxism, is out of the ordinary, and is an exception in historical development. In recent years, some capitalist countries have seen relatively rapid development in their social economies and sciences and technologies, while originally underdeveloped countries have encountered difficulties and twists and turns in building socialism. This has made some representatives of the monopolistic bourgeoisie ecstatic. They have rushed to declare the bankruptcy of Marx's theories on socialism and communism, counting down the days to the end of socialism as a historical phenomenon. However, all these views lack dialectical perspective and historical common sense. In fact, the entire history of mankind is a process of dialectical development. History is lawful, but the laws of history are not something that those who mechanically apply textbooks or are limited by the narrow vision of the bourgeoisie can understand. Many historical phenomena, which seem to be exceptions to history, are actually historical necessities; the exceptions to the rule are the rule of things. Is it not that the general law of world history from slavery to feudalism, from feudalism to capitalism, has often been realized in the exceptions to the rule? Whether it is the countries of Western Europe such as England, France, Germany, and Italy, or the countries of the world from Western Europe and North America to Japan and then to Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the occurrence and development of the capitalist system have not been a simple process, but a very complicated and uneven one. The transition of the world from capital and imperialism to socialism is a whole historical era, in which there must be unevenness and complexity, and unavoidably there will be detours and twists and turns. History is like this, and the necessity and lawfulness of history exist in the unevenness and twists and turns. Comrade Jiang Zemin said: "Seeing only some eddies and countercurrents while not seeing the surging of the historical river can only show the political shortsightedness of the observer." This is indeed the case. The summer insect cannot speak of ice, and the representatives of the bourgeoisie, with their narrow vision, can never imagine the demise of the capitalist system, so they can only rejoice in the difficulties and twists and turns of socialism for the eternal existence of their system.

Setting aside the shortsightedness of the bourgeoisie, when we discuss the laws of history and the methods of understanding social development, apart from firmly holding our socialist faith, it is more important to recognize the position of Chinese socialism in this historical river. From a global perspective, the productive forces, economy, culture, and science and technology under the capitalist system are still developing, and their economic strength will remain greater than that of socialism for a considerable period. It is in this international environment that China, in a country with relatively backward economy and culture, is building a new socialist system. The level of productive forces is not high, the population is the largest in the world while resources such as land are relatively scarce, and the cultural quality of the people is relatively low, etc. These well-known national conditions require long-term arduous struggle to fundamentally change. Under these circumstances, the advanced productive forces and science and technology, huge wealth, and much higher living standards of developed capitalist countries, after we implement opening up to the outside world and learn about the world, cannot but form a great pressure and influence on the thoughts of the Chinese people. If people do not pay attention to the long-term historical differences and simply make comparisons, they will look at capitalist things with envy and doubt the superiority of socialism. Without many examples, people can feel this pressure and influence in their daily lives and in the various pieces of information that are rapidly spreading in the world today. Compared with this objectively existing gap in productive forces and material wealth, the influence of bourgeois ideology is secondary because their ideological influence and infiltration depend on their material wealth. Of course, domestic and foreign hostile elements will never relax in using this gap to spread anti-socialist and pro-capitalist ideas.

This means that the position of Chinese socialism in the historical development of the world determines the necessity and long-term nature of the contradiction between adhering to the socialist road and advocating the capitalist road.

Faced with this situation, there can be two conclusions.

One is to ignore the extreme importance of developing productive forces, believing that in conditions where the economy and culture are not yet developed, one can fundamentally solve the series of contradictions brought about by the current position of socialism and eliminate all possibilities of the capitalist road and thoroughly eliminate the influence of bourgeois decadent ideas. The extreme of this line of thought is to put the task of economic construction in a secondary position, attempting to consolidate the socialist system through continuous revolution in production relations and superstructure, and attempting to eliminate the influence of capitalist and feudal decadent ideas in people's minds through continuous ideological criticism and class struggle. The typical slogan of this is "Poverty-stricken socialism is better than affluent capitalism" that appeared during the Cultural Revolution. The facts have proven that this method not only cannot truly uphold socialism but also seriously damages socialist construction. Under the conditions where the social economy is disturbed and development is slow, and thus the living standards of the people cannot be improved, all the old relations and old ideas that were once eliminated by the revolutionary fire will rise again.

The other conclusion is the approach taken since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. Its characteristic is to abandon the above-mentioned "leftist" naive illusions, carry out rectification, and put socialist economic construction in the central position, implement reform and opening up, and promote the development of economy, culture, and various undertakings. All of these are to rapidly develop social productive forces under socialist conditions, and through long-term arduous efforts, make the level of economic and cultural development of socialism approach and ultimately surpass and even exceed capitalism, laying a solid material foundation for solving all internal and external contradictions determined by the historical position of Chinese socialism. The practice of the past ten years has proven that this line, policy, and approach for developing China's socialist modernization cause are completely correct.

However, one point must be recognized clearly. The change in the above line of thought, or the establishment and implementation of the correct line of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, does not mean that the various contradictions determined by the historical position of Chinese socialism have been eliminated or solved. Because that is determined by major objective facts both domestically and internationally, and it is something that must necessarily exist in a very long historical period. Under the new situation of focusing on economic construction and implementing reform and opening up, these contradictions manifest in new forms, concentrating on the contradiction between the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization. Moreover, under certain conditions, this contradiction can be very sharp and intense. The facts have proven that in the process of our rectification, while concentrating on economic construction and implementing reform and opening up, the trend of doubting the Four Cardinal Principles and advocating capitalist liberalization has also gradually developed. Many people's understanding has become blurred, some people with weak wills have wavered, and some people who are dissatisfied with the socialist system and the Party's leadership have become active. Many ideas and speeches that doubt, deny, and attack the Four Cardinal Principles have spread everywhere, and many ideas and speeches that envy, praise, and worship capitalism have been widely disseminated, resulting in great confusion of thought among the masses and causing political turmoil that endangers stability and unity and our country's fundamental system. If a few years ago the analysis of the nature, harm, and possible development of this contradiction was still a theoretical logical argument, then after the turmoil of this spring and summer, this analysis has almost become a description of the process of the event.

After focusing on economic construction and implementing reform and opening up, the socialist system has shown new vitality and vigor, and China's social productive forces have improved relatively rapidly, and people's living standards have improved significantly. Under these conditions, why has the trend of bourgeois liberalization that doubts and denies the Four Cardinal Principles developed and even become more serious? In my opinion, apart from the mistakes of the leadership, there are at least the following reasons. First, to implement new policies, it is necessary to thoroughly criticize the "leftist" ideas and policies that have caused us great harm in the past and carry out rectification. In this process, if one lacks historical and dialectical perspectives, one may sever history, negate the achievements and correct practices under the socialist system or correct practices under certain conditions, and thus damage people's confidence in socialism and cause doubts about socialism; while some people who are originally dissatisfied with socialism will deliberately do so. Second, many people, due to a misunderstanding of the focus on economic construction, are engrossed in economic activities and seeking to improve their material lives, thinking that the world is peaceful, and losing the necessary vigilance against the activities of domestic and foreign hostile forces and the harm of the trend of bourgeois liberalization. Third, in the process of revitalizing the economy, the diversification of interests has emerged, and economic activities and interest groups that are needed for the development of the current social economy but are contradictory to socialism in nature have emerged. This cannot but reflect differences in attitudes towards socialism and the Four Cardinal Principles, and we still lack perfect countermeasures and measures for this new phenomenon. Due to the inappropriate specific policy measures, some anti-socialist social and economic forces have even emerged in our society. Those who make huge profits by harming socialism through illegal means will naturally demand the development of capitalism and oppose the Four Cardinal Principles. Fourth, after implementing opening up to the outside world, it is not only that our economy, culture, and science and technology have obtained relatively rapid development conditions, but also that the negative and decadent ideas of Western capitalism will be brought in; more importantly, the problem lies in the fact that we have long been facing a Western world with much more developed economy and technology, a Western world with much more money and wealth, and the hostile forces there have always regarded the reform and opening up of socialist countries as a good opportunity to bring these countries into the Western capitalist system. They will inevitably use their advantages in this aspect, using a large amount of money and advanced technological means to carry out political, economic, and ideological and cultural infiltration in our country, to buy so-called "dissidents" in our country, and to spread and encourage the trend of bourgeois liberalization.

The conclusion drawn from this, of course, is not to abandon the current policies and return to the past "leftist" erroneous practices of "taking class struggle as the key link" and closure, but to consciously uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization in the new historical period, recognizing the seriousness and long-term nature of this struggle. If we do not see that the contradiction between the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization has its objective basis both domestically and internationally, if we do not put the class struggle that exists within a certain range in a certain position, and lose vigilance against this struggle becoming intensified under certain conditions, especially if some leading comrades of the Party not only lose vigilance against bourgeois liberalization but even stand on the side of supporting bourgeois liberalization, then serious consequences will be caused, and even the political premise of our concentrating on economic construction and reform and opening up will be destroyed. The facts of the past ten years have deeply exposed this truth. This also shows that at the beginning of the establishment of the new line and policy by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our Party and Comrade Deng Xiaoping solemnly raised the issue of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles, emphasized it, and incorporated it into the Party's basic line as the basis for a series of policies such as reform and opening up. This was very foresighted.

III. The Core of the Contradiction Lies in Whether to Uphold Socialism

The Four Cardinal Principles are unified and form an integral whole, and none of them can be missing. If any one of them is not upheld, the other three will necessarily be damaged and weakened. Whether from the above historical background and historical position of Chinese socialism or from the current essence of the debate, the core of the contradiction between the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization lies in whether to uphold the leadership of the Party and the socialist road. The issue of the socialist road, in particular, most concentratedly reflects this contradiction. If one follows the viewpoint of bourgeois liberalization, advocates economic privatization, takes the capitalist road, and becomes a vassal of foreign capital, then what is the task of the big and small bourgeoisie and their agents? What is the use of the leadership of the Communist Party and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism? What is the use of the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class (which is essentially the dictatorship of the proletariat)? Not only should it not exist, but it should be thoroughly overthrown.

Of course, the "elite" who advocate bourgeois liberalization are very clever. They generally do not raise the issue so frankly. They always put on a posture of being for the country and the people, posing as reformers, and eloquently say that their proposals are for China's modernization, for the rapid development of economy and technology, for the improvement of people's living standards and people's democracy and freedom, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to briefly expose and analyze some of their points and methods of argument.

The debate first manifests in the evaluation of the history of socialist development. In Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech, he briefly narrated the great achievements of the People's Republic of China since its founding, pointing out that "we have used the strength of the basic political and economic systems of socialism, relying on the self-reliant and arduous struggle of all ethnic groups, overcoming various difficulties, and turning China from a poor and backward semi-colonial and semi-feudal country into a relatively prosperous and thriving socialist country." "Our economic development and improvement of people's living standards, not only compared with our past history, are extremely significant, but also compared with many other countries, are not inferior." This process of progress supported by obvious facts and important figures shows the superiority of the socialist system. This point, whether it is the scientific thinking of serious researchers or the sensory remembrance of laborers who have experienced this period of history, is fully affirmed. Undoubtedly, we have made mistakes and setbacks, and there are still many defects in the specific system of our socialist system, which is precisely what our Party has repeatedly admitted and exposed, and is now actively correcting and reforming. However, the advocates of bourgeois liberalization, with partiality for the whole, speak ill of the 40-year history of socialism, especially the first 30 years of history, saying that it is worthless. They even oppose comparing our achievements with the miserable situation of the old China before liberation. This shows that they do not know what historical progress is, showing that their intention is not to overcome mistakes and reform the defects of our socialist system, but to fundamentally negate and change it. It is also worth mentioning that not only in our country, but also in the world today, there is a trend to defame and negate the entire history of socialism since the October Revolution and further negate the socialist system. From the reactionary politicians of the capitalist world to some wavering elements in socialist countries, they are spreading this view in various ways. They have a big common point with the "elite" of bourgeois liberalization in China, that is, they are all heroes who can see the tip of the needle but not the cartload of firewood. They are mocking history, and history will mock them in the end.

Another viewpoint of the trend of bourgeois liberalization is to disregard historical conditions and compare socialist China with some developed capitalist countries, reaching the conclusion of negating the socialist system and advocating the capitalist system, as if capitalism can make China as rich as Western developed countries. In early 1987, the author had made reports on this issue in many places, analyzing the problem of how to compare, which aroused the hatred of the supporters of the trend of bourgeois liberalization. However, apart from their use of power to suppress, I have not seen any powerful refutation in theory so far. In fact, the problem is simple. To compare, one must consider the different historical conditions, natural conditions, economic and cultural development levels, and the position of a country in international economic and political relations. Otherwise, it cannot be called scientific. To implement capitalism in China will not turn China into a developed country like Europe and America, but only into a poor vassal of these countries. Because China and Western developed capitalist countries have taken fundamentally different historical paths in the past. The development of capitalism in those countries has a history of three to four hundred years or at least one to two hundred years, and it is at the cost of the great pain and sacrifice of many generations of their own laborers that it has developed, and it is through the plunder and ruthless exploitation of colonies and semi-colonies around the world that it has developed. While China's socialist construction has only 40 years, before that it was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, suffering from more than a hundred years of plunder and exploitation by capitalist-imperialism. The gap in economic development between the two is the result of several hundred years of history. We can calculate a simple account, that is, since the Opium War, China has paid how many tens of billions of taels of silver in war indemnities alone, and the plunder and exploitation of imperialism and the wars they supported have caused us to lose how many lives and property, while these developed countries have plundered and exploited how much wealth, including the wealth of the Chinese people, in the process of plundering and exploiting colonies and semi-colonies to support their economic development. Without including this basic account of loss and gain, comparisons cannot be made. Secondly, if we compare the 40 years of development of New China with countries that were originally at a similar level of development to ours, as Comrade Jiang Zemin said, we are in no way inferior. Now there are more than a hundred countries in the world that implement the capitalist system, and rich countries are only a small number. Although developing countries face many common difficulties, whether in national independence, social stability, improvement of people's living standards and social justice, or in the speed of economic, cultural, scientific, and technological development, socialist China has shown obvious advantages. China has its own historical characteristics compared with developing countries, that is, China has already walked a victorious 40 years on the socialist road. China is a country with 1.1 billion people, with relatively scarce resources, and the people, from their personal experience, feel that only the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system have made the country realize independence and unity, and the economy and culture have developed relatively rapidly, and people's living standards have been generally improved. If we abandon socialism and implement capitalism, we will inevitably use the blood and sweat of hundreds of millions of laborers to cultivate and fatten a new bourgeoisie, making the broad masses of laborers fall back into extreme poverty, becoming double slaves of foreign capital and the domestic exploiting class. Although people now have various opinions and dissatisfaction with the work of the Party and the government, the Chinese people, who have the profound experience of being masters of the house and not being enslaved under the socialist system for 40 years, will never accept the capitalist road. No matter what heroes come out to implement capitalism, they will inevitably face the opposition of the vast majority of the people, and China will inevitably fall into division and chaos. This is the reason why any turmoil initiated by the "elite" of bourgeois liberalization and their supporters will inevitably fail.

Opposing historical longitudinal comparison and simple, unscientific horizontal comparison is a shallow formalistic argument of the viewpoint of bourgeois liberalization. A deeper argument is the so-called theoretical argument of the "elite" of bourgeois liberalization. This is to link our work errors and specific systemic defects with the fundamental political and economic system of socialism, believing that this is determined by the socialist public ownership system and the people's democratic system led by the Communist Party. The most common and also the most shallow saying is: public ownership makes people lose a sense of responsibility and initiative, only privatization can mobilize initiative, and promote the rapid development of economy, culture, and other undertakings. For this, they do not analyze and cite some seemingly reasonable examples. This theory is nothing more than the old theory of the bourgeoisie: selfishness is human nature. Not to mention that Marx and Engels had already thoroughly refuted this bourgeois prejudice in the Communist Manifesto, even the reality of the capitalist countries they admire can completely refute this theory of human nature.

The contradiction between the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization reflects the opposition of the worldviews, historical views, and value views of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Without the perspective of historical materialism and the method of dialectical materialism, without standing on the side of the working class and the broad masses of laborers, and even fundamentally opposing such a standpoint, viewpoint, and method, and wanting to design a development path for China, is the tragic aspect of the "elite" of bourgeois liberalization and their supporters.

From historical facts and theory, we can refute the claims of bourgeois liberalization, prove their absurdity, and use them to educate the broad masses and young people, but we still cannot fundamentally solve the contradiction between the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization. Because, as mentioned above, this contradiction is determined by the historical position of Chinese socialism in this stage. Before this position undergoes fundamental change, the objective basis for its existence will not be eliminated, and domestic and foreign hostile forces will continue to change forms to spread the trend of bourgeois liberalization. The broad masses generally determine their thoughts and actions based on their current actual interests. They have gained increasing political and economic interests from the construction and development of New China, and therefore sincerely support socialism; but they also feel dissatisfied from comparing with some wealthy countries abroad, and therefore are easily influenced by the erroneous ideas of bourgeois liberalization. Only the advanced elements of the working class can see the direction of our progress and historical responsibility through the mist of phenomena. This is where the importance of the Party's leadership and Party building lies. In the democratic revolution, it was not that all the masses had a scientific understanding of the laws and future of the development of Chinese society and the Chinese revolution before they rose up in revolution. At that time, the Chinese Communist Party combined its highest program of socialism and communism with the realistic tasks of each stage, and combined it with the immediate interests of the broad masses in liberating themselves, thus leading the masses to step by step achieve victory and step by step raise their consciousness. It is the same today. In the socialist modernization construction and reform and opening up, the Chinese Communist Party, especially its leaders at all levels, must have a firm belief in socialism and communism, have a clear understanding of the long-term nature of the contradiction between the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization, and have sufficient vigilance against the "peaceful evolution" strategy of hostile forces in Western countries and the activities of domestic hostile elements; they must be good at combining the long-term strategic goals with the current realistic tasks, while unremittingly fighting for the realistic interests of the people, unremittingly carrying out scientific ideological education and ideological and political work for the people. To do this, it is required that the Party itself can continuously strengthen its construction, maintain the thoroughness of theory, the purity of revolution, and the firmness of principles, strengthen organizational discipline and combat effectiveness, and truly become the steadfast core leading the socialist modernization construction. The main purpose of our understanding of the contradiction between the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization is also here.

    论四项基本原则与资产阶级自由化的对立
    卢之超
    今年春夏之交的风波，既表现了四项基本原则与资产阶级自由化的尖锐对立，又是这种对立长期发展的结果。它的发生不是偶然的。因此，在庆祝人民共和国40周年，总结40年社会主义建设经验的时候，不能不放在这种对立的大背景下面来考虑问题。江泽民同志的国庆讲话，自始至终贯穿了坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的精神，体现了对我国社会主义事业的命运、我国社会主义现代化建设和改革开放前途的深刻的、历史的与科学的思考。
    一、关于四十年的历史经验
    一切正直的中国人都会感觉到，新中国成立以来的40年，中国共产党领导中国人民走过了一条极不平坦而又十分辉煌的道路。我们建设的外部条件并不有利，在相当的时期里，充满了外国敌对势力的孤立、封锁、颠覆和干涉，至今他们仍未放弃对我国实行“和平演变”的企图。国内因素也并不有利，我国的经济文化比较落后，旧中国留下的是满目疮痍的烂摊子；从领导到群众都缺乏建设现代文明的足够知识和准备，缺乏建设新生活的经验。因此，社会主义革命和社会主义建设不能不是一个充满复杂斗争、艰苦探索、屡遭挫折、不断克服“左”的或右的错误的过程。40多年来，我们在取得举世瞩目的伟大成就的同时，饱尝了创业和探索的艰辛。社会主义事业是前无古人的事业。这个过程证明了中国共产党人是真正的历史开拓者；显示了伟大的中国人民连绵不绝的奋斗、苦斗精神和永无止境的创造力。
    在前30年的探索中，我们在极其困难的条件下取得十分可观的进步。正是这种进步为近10年的发展奠定了基础。我们不能割断历史，不能因为时间相距已远和犯过错误而忽视或轻视这个时期取得的进步。因为正如江泽民同志所说的，十一届三中全会以来的巨大成就也是前30年中国社会主义革命和建设成果的进一步发展。当然，在这个时期，特别在其后20年中，也犯了不少错误。主体的错误是“左”的错误，在经济上急于求成，在形势分析和工作指导上夸大阶级斗争，以至提出“以阶级斗争为纲”。由于不断抓阶级斗争，搞政治运动，一方面影响了工作重心的转移，没有能够集中力量进行经济建设，使我们丧失了不少大好时机，在经济技术发展上，拉开了与发达国家的差距；一方面由于阶级斗争的扩大化，伤害了不少好人，挫伤了广大群众特别是知识分子的积极性。
    在40年的后10年，即最近10年，我国历史发生了重大转折，进入了一个新的历史时期。其根本特点就是纠正了“以阶级斗争为纲”的错误，把全党全国的工作重点转移到进行经济建设、发展社会生产力方面来，并为此制定和实行了改革开放的基本方针和政策。这个工作重心的转变和新的方针政策的正确性，已经为10年经济、文化的迅速发展和巨大成就所证实。
    一个值得注意的现象是，前30年，几乎天天反右，天天讲阶级斗争，结果发生了严重的“左”的错误。近10年党的路线是正确的，全党全国人民集中力量搞经济建设，但是资产阶级自由化思潮又逐渐发展起来，党的某些主要领导又犯了支持这种思潮的错误。看来这种现象不是偶然的，必须对它进行科学的分析，我们才能对于历史经验取得比较全面和深刻的认识。几乎与十一届三中全会决定工作重心转移、制定发展经济和改革开放等新方针的同时，邓小平同志就代表我们党提出了坚持社会主义道路、坚持人民民主专政、坚持共产党的领导和坚持马列主义毛泽东思想四项基本原则的问题。四项基本原则并不是新东西，是我们党一贯坚持的。但是在新时期强调地把它提出来，具有历史的原因和新的需要。这是因为在拨乱反正的过程中，怀疑和否定这四项基本原则的思潮即资产阶级自由化思潮就乘机发展起来。而在我们一心一意进行经济建设和改革开放的时候，这种思潮更是一次又一次地泛滥，成为干扰和破坏我国社会主义事业的一个重要因素。造成这种情况，顽固坚持和疯狂鼓吹资产阶级自由化的少数代表人物，消极对待坚持四项基本原则和纵容、支持资产阶级自由化的个别领导人，当然有他们不可推卸的责任，特别是对于资产阶级自由化的恶性发展和矛盾激化具有直接的责任。但是一般说来，这种错误思潮和反动逆流在新时期的存在和发展，却有它的历史必然。
    一句话，四项基本原则与资产阶级自由化的对立，是我国在基本克服了“左”的错误以后，在社会主义现代化建设中将要长期存在的必然现象。10年的实践已经可以使我们得出这个认识，因而我们对此要有长期的足够的思想准备。
    二、为什么必然产生这种对立
    从根本上说，这种对立是由中国社会主义的历史地位决定的。就这种对立的一般性质而言，甚至还可以扩展一点说，它是由当代社会主义的历史地位决定的。
    1917年伟大的十月革命，是二十世纪最重大的事件。自从那时以后，人类历史开始了由资本主义向社会主义、共产主义的过渡。值得注意的是，社会主义制度不是从资本主义最发达的地区开始建立的，中国更是一个经济文化落后、资本主义关系很不发达的国家。而在社会经济和资本主义关系高度发达的国家至今还没有建立社会主义。许多人认为这种现象离开了马克思主义所分析的社会发展规律，是脱出了常规，是历史发展的例外。近些年来某些资本主义国家的社会经济和科学技术有相当快的发展，原来不够发达的国家在建设社会主义中又遇到了困难和曲折。这更使一些垄断资产阶级代表人物欣喜若狂。他们一个一个争先恐后地跑出来宣布马克思关于社会主义、共产主义学说的破产，屈指计算社会主义作为一种历史现象的行将结束。但是，所有这些看法都缺乏辩证的观点和历史的常识。其实，整个人类历史是辩证法的发展过程。历史是有规律的，但历史规律决不是那些生吞活剥教科书的人和为资产阶级狭隘眼界所局限的人所能理解的。许多历史现象，看似历史的例外，实属历史的必然；常规的例外才是事物的常规。难道世界历史从奴隶制到封建制度，从封建主义到资本主义这样一种一般规律，不都常常是在常规的例外中实现的吗？无论是西欧的英、法、德、意诸国，还是世界范围内从西欧、北美到日本以至亚、非、拉美各国，资本主义制度的发生和发展，难道不是一个非常错综复杂、参差不齐的过程吗？世界由资本——帝国主义进入社会主义，是一整个历史时代，其间必然也是参差不齐、错综复杂的，并且不可避免地会有迂回和曲折。历史本来就是这样，历史的必然性、规律性本来就存在于参差不齐、迂回曲折之中。江泽民同志说：“仅仅看见某些旋涡和逆流而看不到历史长河的奔腾，只能说明观察者的政治短视。”真是千真万确。夏虫不可语冰，资产者的代表们的狭隘眼界无论如何不能想象资本主义制度的灭亡，所以只能从社会主义的困难和曲折中庆幸他们那个制度的万世长存。
    撇开资产者的短视不说吧。我们谈论历史规律和认识社会发展的方法，除了坚定我们社会主义的信念以外，更重要的是为了认识我国社会主义在这个历史长河中的地位。从世界范围说，资本主义制度下的生产力、经济文化、科学技术仍在发展，而且其经济实力在相当长的时期内仍然大于社会主义。中国正是在这种国际环境中，在经济文化相当落后的国土上建设新生的社会主义制度的。生产力水平不高，人口居世界之冠而土地等资源相对不足，人民的文化素质比较低等等，这些人所共知的国情，需要长期的艰苦奋斗才能根本改变。在这种情况下，资本主义发达国家先进的生产力和科学技术、巨大的财富及比我们高得多的生活水平，在我们实行对外开放、了解世界以后，不能不在我国人民的思想上形成巨大的压力和影响。人们如果没有注意长期历史形成的差距而简单地进行对比，就会对资本主义的事物投以羡慕的眼光，而对社会主义优越性发生怀疑。用不着多举例，人们在日常生活中，在当今世界迅速得到传播的各种信息中，随时都可以感到这种压力和影响的存在。与这种客观存在的生产力和物质财富的差距相比，国际资产阶级思想的影响还是第二位的，因为他们的思想影响和渗透是依附于其物质财富的。当然，国内外的敌对分子绝不会放松利用这种差距来散布反对社会主义、主张资本主义的思想。
    这就是说，中国社会主义事业在世界历史发展中的地位，决定了坚持社会主义道路与主张资本主义道路之间的对立的必然性和长期性。
    面对这种状况，可以有两种结论。
    一是忽视发展生产力的极端重要性，以为在经济文化还不发达的条件下可以根本解决社会主义目前地位下带来的一系列矛盾，根绝资本主义道路的一切可能性和彻底消除资产阶级腐朽思想的影响。这种思路的极端就是把经济建设的任务放在次要地位，企图靠生产关系、上层建筑的不断革命来巩固社会主义制度，企图用不断开展思想批判和阶级斗争的办法清除人们头脑中资本主义、封建主义腐朽思想的影响。其典型口号就是“文化大革命”中出现的“宁要贫穷的社会主义。”事实证明，这种办法不仅不能真正坚持社会主义，而且会严重破坏社会主义建设。而在社会经济受到干扰、发展迟缓，从而人民生活水平得不到提高的条件下，曾经被革命烈火消灭了的一切旧的关系和旧的思想又都死灰复燃。
    另一种结论，就是党的十一届三中全会开始的做法。其特点就在于丢掉了上述“左”的幼稚的幻想，实行拨乱反正，把社会主义的经济建设放在中心地位，实行改革开放，以促进经济文化和各项事业的发展。所有这一切，都是为了在社会主义条件下迅速发展社会生产力，经过长期艰苦的努力，使社会主义的经济文化发展水平接近和最终赶上以至超过资本主义，为解决我国社会主义历史地位所决定的一切内外矛盾奠定坚实的物质基础。十年来的实践证明，这种发展我国社会主义现代化事业的路线方针政策是完全正确的。
    但是，有一点必须持清醒的认识。上述思路的变换，或十一届三中全会正确路线的确立和执行，并不意味着中国社会主义事业的历史地位所决定的各种矛盾已经消除或已经解决。因为那是国际国内重大的客观事实所决定了的，是在一个很长的历史时期里必然存在着的。在以经济建设为中心，实行改革开放的新形势下，这些矛盾表现为新的形式，集中地表现为四项基本原则与资产阶级自由化的对立。而且在一定的条件下，这种对立还会很尖锐，很激烈。事实证明，在我们实行拨乱反正的过程中，在一心抓经济建设和实行改革开放的过程中，怀疑四项基本原则、主张资本主义的自由化思潮也逐步发展起来。许多人的认识模糊了，一些意志不坚定的人动摇了，一些对社会主义制度和党的领导心怀不满的人活跃了。许多怀疑、否定、攻击四项基本原则的思想和言论到处流传，许多羡慕、赞扬、崇拜资本主义的思想的言论广为散布，结果不仅在群众中造成了极大的思想混乱，而且在政治上造成了危害安定团结、危害我们国家根本制度的动乱。如果说，前几年对这种对立的性质、危害和发展可能性的分析还是一种理论上的逻辑论证的话，那么，在经过春夏之交的风波以后，这种分析几乎是变成对事件过程的描述了。
    以经济建设为中心，实行改革开放以后，社会主义制度显示出新的活力和生机，我国社会生产力有了较快的提高，人民生活有了较大的改善。在这种条件下，为什么怀疑、否定四项基本原则的资产阶级自由化思潮反而有所发展，而且日趋严重呢？我看，除了领导方面失误以外，至少有如下一些原因。第一，实行新的政策，必须彻底批判过去给我们造成很大危害的“左”的思想和政策，拨乱反正。在这个过程中，如果缺乏历史的和辩证的观点，就可能割断历史，把社会主义制度下取得的成就和正确做法或在一定条件下是正确的做法也否定了，以致损害了人们对社会主义的信心，造成了对社会主义的怀疑；而一些本来就对社会主义心怀不满的人则有意这样做。第二，许多人出于对经济建设为中心的误解，埋头于经济活动和谋求改善物质生活，以为天下太平，对国内外敌对势力的活动和资产阶级自由化思潮的危害性失去应有的警惕。第三，在搞活经济的过程中，产生了利益的多元化，产生了为现阶段社会经济发展所需要而又与社会主义在性质上相矛盾的经济活动与利益群体，这不能不在对待社会主义、四项基本原则的态度上表现出差异来，而我们对这种新现象还缺乏完善的对策和措施。由于某些具体政策措施的失当，在我国社会甚至分泌出一些反对社会主义的社会经济力量。那些靠以损害社会主义的不法手段牟取暴利的人，自然要求发展资本主义，反对四项基本原则。第四，实行对外开放以后，绝不仅仅是在我国经济、文化、科学技术获得较快发展条件的同时，也会带来西方资本主义的某些消极腐朽的思想影响；更加重要的问题在于，我们长期面对的是一个经济技术比我们发达得多的西方世界，一个比我们有钱得多、富裕得多的西方世界，而那里的敌对势力，一向是把社会主义国家的改革开放看作是他们把这些国家引入西方资本主义体系的好机会的。他们必然要凭借他们这方面的优势，用大量的金钱和先进的技术手段来对我们进行政治的、经济的和思想文化的渗透，在我国收买所谓“持不同政见者”，传播和鼓励资产阶级自由化的思潮。
    由此得出的结论，当然不是放弃现在的方针，回到过去那种“以阶级斗争为纲”的、封闭的、“左”的错误做法上去，而是在新的历史时期必须自觉地坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化，认识这种斗争的严重性和长期性。如果我们看不到四项基本原则与资产阶级自由化的对立是有其国内、国际的客观根据的，如果不把一定范围内存在的阶级斗争放在一定的位置上，对这种斗争在一定条件下还会激化失去警惕，特别是如果党的某些领导人不仅对资产阶级自由化失去警惕，反而站在支持资产阶级自由化的立场上，那就会造成严重的后果，甚至会破坏我们集中精力进行经济建设和改革开放的政治前提。十年来的事实已经深刻地揭露了这个真理。这也说明，在十一届三中全会确立新的路线方针之初，我们党和邓小平同志就郑重地提出坚持四项基本原则的问题，着重地加以阐明，并把它纳入党的基本路线，作为改革开放等一系列方针政策的基础，是十分有预见的。
    三、对立的核心在于是否坚持社会主义
    四项基本原则是统一的，是一个整体，缺一不可。不坚持其中任何一项，其他三项就必然受到损害和削弱。无论是从上述中国社会主义的历史背景和历史地位看，还是从当前争论的实质看，是否坚持党的领导和社会主义道路，是四项基本原则与资产阶级自由化对立的核心。而社会主义道路问题，尤为集中地反映这种对立。如果按资产阶级自由化的观点，搞经济私有化，走资本主义道路，做外国资本的附庸，那当然是大大小小的资产者及其代理人的任务，还要共产党领导、马列主义指导干什么？还要工人阶级领导的人民民主专政（其实质是无产阶级专政）干什么？不仅不能要，而且要彻底打倒。
    当然，鼓吹资产阶级自由化的“精英”们是很聪明的，他们一般地不如此直率地提出问题。他们总是摆出一副为国为民的姿态，以改革者自居，振振有词，说他们那套主张是为了中国的现代化，为了经济技术的迅速发展，为了人民生活水平的提高和人民的民主自由，等等。因此，有必要就他们的一些论点和论证方法作简要的揭露和分析。
    争论首先表现在对于社会主义发展历史的估计。江泽民同志的讲话里，简要地叙述了中华人民共和国建立以来40年的伟大成就，指出，“我们运用社会主义的基本的政治制度和经济制度的力量，依靠各族人民发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，克服种种困难，使中国由一个一穷二白的半殖民地、半封建国家变成了一个初步繁荣昌盛的社会主义国家。”“我们的经济发展和人民生活水平的提高，不仅同我国过去历史相比极为显著，而且同其他许多国家相比，也并不逊色。”这个由明显事实和重要数字支持的进步过程，表现了社会主义制度的优越性。这一点，无论是严肃的研究者的科学思维，还是经历过这段历史的劳动者的感性回顾，都是充分肯定的。无疑，我们有过失误和挫折，我国社会主义制度的具体体制上还有不少弊病，正是我们党多次承认和揭露过这些失误和弊病，并正在积极进行纠正和改革。但是资产阶级自由化的鼓吹者却以偏概全，把社会主义40年的历史，特别是其前30年的历史说得一无是处，他们甚至反对拿我们取得的成就与解放前旧中国的悲惨境地作纵向的比较。这说明他们不知道什么叫历史的进步，说明他们的用意不在克服失误和改革我国社会主义制度的某些弊病，而是企图根本否定和改变它。还要顺便说一点，不仅在国内，现在世界上也存在一种诋毁、否定自十月革命以来整个社会主义的历史、并进而否定社会主义制度的思潮。从资本主义世界的反动政客到社会主义国家里的某些动摇分子都在以各种方式散布这种观点。他们同中国的资产阶级自由化“精英”有一个很大的共同点，就是他们都是一些明察秋毫之末而不见舆薪的英雄。他们在嘲弄历史，最终历史会嘲弄他们的。
    资产阶级自由化思潮的另一观点，就是不顾历史条件地拿社会主义的中国和某些发达的资本主义国家比，以达到否定社会主义制度、主张资本主义制度的结论，似乎一搞资本主义就可以使中国变得像西方发达国家那样富有。1987年初，笔者曾在不少场合就这个问题作过报告，分析了应当如何比较的问题，因而引起资产阶级自由化思潮支持者的痛恨。但是除了他们利用职权进行压制以外，至今我没有见到在理论上有什么有力的诘驳。其实问题很简单，要比较就必须考虑各个国家发展的不同历史条件、自然条件、经济文化发展程度以及它在国际经济政治中所处的地位。否则就不能称之谓科学。在中国搞资本主义，绝不会把中国变成欧美那样的发达国家，而只能变成这些国家的贫穷的附庸。因为中国与西方发达资本主义国家过去所走的是根本不同的历史道路。那些国家的资本主义发展有三四百年至少一二百年的历史，经过资本主义的原始积累，是以多少代本国劳动者的极大痛苦和牺牲为代价发展起来的，是靠着对全世界殖民地半殖民地的侵略、掠夺和残酷剥削发展起来的。而中国社会主义建设才40年，在此以前是一个半殖民地半封建的社会，遭受资本——帝国主义一百多年的侵略、掠夺和剥削。这两者目前在经济发展上的差距，是几百年的历史造成的。我们可以算一笔简单的帐，即鸦片战争以来一百多年中，中国单战败赔款就有多少亿两白银，帝国主义的侵略和他们支持的内战又使我们损失了多少生命与财产，而这些发达国家在侵略殖民地半殖民地过程中，则掠夺剥削了多少财富，包括中国人民的财富，以支持他们的经济发展。不把这个起码的一损一得的帐算进去，就不能进行比较。其次，如果拿新中国40年的发展同原来在发展程度上和我国差不多的国家相比，正如江泽民同志所说的，我们毫不逊色。现在世界上有一百多个国家实行资本主义制度，富国只是很少数。虽然发展中国家都面临许多共同的困难，但无论在国家独立、社会安定、人民生活提高和社会公正方面，还是在经济文化科学技术发展速度方面，社会主义中国都显示出明显的优势。中国与发展中国家相比，还有自己的历史特点，即中国已经在社会主义道路上走过了胜利的40年。中国是一个有11亿人口的大国，资源相对贫乏，人民从切身体会中感到只有共产党的领导和社会主义制度才使国家实现独立和统一，经济文化得到较快的发展，人民生活得到普遍改善。如果放弃社会主义而去搞资本主义，必然要用亿万劳动人民的血汗去培植和养肥一个新生的资产阶级，使广大劳动人民重新陷入极其贫困的境地，沦为外国资本和本国剥削阶级的双重奴隶。现在人们虽然对党和政府的工作有这样那样的意见和不满，但是具有40年社会主义制度下当家作主不受奴役的深刻体验的中国人民，是决不会接受资本主义道路的。无论什么英雄好汉出来搞资本主义，必然要遭到绝大多数人民的反对，中国必然要陷入分裂和内乱之中。这就是资产阶级自由化“精英”及其支持者发动任何动乱都必然要遭到失败的原因。
    反对历史的纵比，简单的不科学的横比，是资产阶级自由化观点的一种肤浅的形式主义的论据。深一层的论据，是资产阶级自由化“精英”们的所谓理论论证。这就是把我们工作上的失误和具体体制上的弊病同社会主义的根本政治经济制度联系起来，认为这是社会主义公有制和共产党领导的人民民主制度所决定的。最常见的其实也是最肤浅的说法是：公有制使得人们失去责任感和积极性，只有私有化才可以调动积极性，促进经济文化等事业迅速发展。为此，还不加分析地举一些似是而非的例子。这种理论，不过是资产阶级老而又老的理论：自私是人的本性。且不说马克思、恩格斯在《共产党宣言》里对这种资产者的偏见早已有淋漓尽致的驳斥，就是他们羡慕不已的资本主义国家的现实也完全可以驳倒这种人性论。
    四项基本原则与资产阶级自由化的对立，反映出无产阶级与资产阶级两种世界观、历史观、价值观的对立。没有历史唯物主义的观点和唯物辩证法的方法，不站在工人阶级和广大劳动人民的立场上，乃至根本反对这样的立场、观点、方法，而想为中国设计发展道路，正是资产阶级自由化“精英”们及其支持者的可悲之处。
    从历史事实上和理论上可以驳倒资产阶级自由化的主张，证明它的荒谬，并用以教育广大群众和青年，但仍然不能根本解决四项基本原则与资产阶级自由化的对立。因为如前所述，这种对立是现阶段中国社会主义的历史地位决定的。在这种地位未获根本变化之前，它赖以存在的客观基础不会消除，而且国内外敌对势力总是要不断变换形式来散布资产阶级自由化思潮。广大群众一般都是根据当前的实际利益来决定自己的思想和行动的。他们从新中国的建设和发展中获得了日益增长的政治经济利益，因而由衷地拥护社会主义；但他们从与国外的某些富裕国家的对比中又感到不满足，因而又易于受资产阶级自由化的错误思想的影响。只有工人阶级的先进分子才能透过现象的迷雾看到我们前进的方向和历史的责任。这就是党的领导和党的建设的重要性之所在。在民主革命中，并不是所有群众都对中国社会和中国革命的发展规律与发展前途有了科学的认识才起来革命的。当时，中国共产党把自己的社会主义、共产主义的最高纲领与各阶段的现实任务结合起来，与广大群众翻身解放的切身利益结合起来，从而引导群众一步步地夺取胜利，一步步地提高了觉悟。今天也是这样。在社会主义现代化建设和改革开放中，中国共产党特别是它的各级领导人必须对社会主义、共产主义有坚定的信念，对四项基本原则和资产阶级自由化的对立的长期性有清醒的认识，对西方国家敌对势力的“和平演变”策略和国内敌对分子的活动有足够的警惕；必须善于把远大的战略目标与当前的实际任务结合起来，在坚持不懈地为人民群众现实利益而奋斗的同时，坚持不懈地对人民群众进行科学的思想教育和思想政治工作。而要做到这一点，又要求这个党自身能够不断加强建设，能够保持理论的彻底性、革命的纯洁性和原则的坚定性，加强组织纪律性和战斗力，真正成为领导社会主义现代化建设的坚定核心。我们认识四项原则与资产阶级自由化对立的主要目的也在这里。
