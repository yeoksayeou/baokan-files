Title: Don't Let the Farce Repeat

Upon arriving in Wenzhou, I noticed that the hillsides along the roads were dotted with glaring white structures. Upon inquiry, I learned that these were newly built graves. These varied "yinhuai" (ancestral tombs) ruined the scenic beauty of the southern landscape, occupying vast tracts of woodland, truly making one uncomfortable.

Wenzhou's rural areas have had the custom of building graves for a long time. However, impoverished people could barely fill their stomachs, let alone afford to build grand graves? Generally, they would only build simple flat graves, occupying no more than 3 square meters. Only wealthy families could afford to build large graves, which, due to their shape resembling a high-backed chair, are also called "chair graves."

Ten years ago, "chair graves" were still quite rare in Wenzhou. After the reform and opening up, the rapid development of the commodity economy made Wenzhou's rural population quickly become wealthy. Due to some places relaxing ideological and educational work, the old custom of showing off quickly spread. Especially from 1985 to 1987, Wenzhou's rural areas experienced a wave of "grave-building fever." There were even sayings like "how rich you are can be seen from your grave." One grave more magnificent than the next began to appear on the green hills and slopes.

To secure "auspicious burial sites," some people did not hesitate to cut down large numbers of trees and bamboo. Building one grave could result in the felling of fifty or sixty trees. More seriously, grave builders even competed with each other, making the graves larger and larger, occupying more and more land and destroying more and more forests. Generally, a "chair grave" would occupy sixty to seventy square meters, with some occupying over two hundred square meters. Some people would even go to great lengths to build pavilions within the grave enclosure. Building one grave could cost tens of thousands of yuan.

In addition to building new graves, some people also repaired, expanded, and rebuilt old graves and ancestral graves, even building graves in advance for the living. This also occupied a large amount of land. In Jingle Town, Jin Guang Ao Village, Leqing County, a farmer spent 30,000 yuan last year to expand his father's flat grave into a large "chair grave," occupying over sixty square meters.

The "grave-building fever" led to severe wastage of land. According to statistics from relevant departments, in recent years, an average of 15,000 graves have appeared annually in the green hills and slopes of Wenzhou City. Including a large number of ancestral graves being repaired and expanded, the city loses about 1 million square meters of land and over 60,000 trees annually.

It is not an exaggeration to say that building large graves has become a major "public nuisance" that damages the ecological environment and harms land resources.

Fortunately, in September last year, the various levels of people's governments and relevant departments in Wenzhou decided to mobilize the masses to eradicate this "public nuisance." Various places extensively carried out propaganda for changing customs and firmly implemented funeral reforms.

At the same time, the entire city launched a large-scale campaign to clear grave hills and tombs, collect greening fees, and strictly prohibit the building of large graves, stopping the trend of arbitrarily building and expanding graves. Many places adopted the approach of guiding, educating, and supporting the masses to use barren hills and wastelands to build public cemeteries. So far, each county (city, district) in the city has built 112 public cemeteries. This not only greatly saved land but also significantly reduced funeral expenses. Wenzhou's approach has been promoted throughout Zhejiang Province.

It is hoped that more regions that have not yet become wealthy will learn from Wenzhou's lessons, promptly grasp ideological education, prevent old customs from resurfacing, and guide farmers to cherish the mountains and rivers of their hometowns, so as not to repeat the farce of the dead and the living competing for land.

    莫让闹剧再重演
    浙江省杭州市　张和平
    乍到温州，发现公路两旁的山峦中堆隆着一片片刺眼的白色建筑物。经询问，方知道那是一座座新起的坟墓。这些五花八门的“阴宅”，破坏了南国青山绿水的秀美韵味，占据了大片林地，真让人不舒服。
    温州农村过去就有修坟的旧习。但贫穷百姓连肚子都吃不饱，哪有余钱去修大坟？一般只堆个筒易的平坟，占地不过3平方米。只有有钱人家，才造得起大坟，因其外型像太师椅，所以又称“椅子坟”。
    十年前，温州的“椅子坟”还是很少的。改革开放后，商品经济迅速发展，使温州农村群众迅速富裕起来，由于一些地方放松了思想教育工作，讲排场的殡葬旧习很快蔓延开来。特别是1985—1987年，温州农村大刮起了“造坟风”。还流传着“富不富，看坟墓”等顺口溜。一座比一座气派的“椅子坟”在青山绿坡上冒了出来。
    为了占据“风水宝地”，一些人不惜大量伐树砍竹。有的建一座坟，就砍掉五六十棵树木。更为严重的是，造坟者竟互相攀比，坟的面积越来越大，占地毁林越来越多。一般“椅子坟”占地六七十平方米，大的竟占地200多平方米。有的人还不惜工本，在坟圈里建造亭台。造一座坟墓要耗资数万元。
    除了建新坟外，一些人还修缮、扩建、改建老坟、祖坟，甚至为活人预先造墓。这又占去了大量山地。乐清县慎江镇金光岙村一农户去年上半年耗资3万元，把其父亲的平坟扩建为大型“椅子坟”，占地60多平方米。
    “造坟风”造成土地的严重浪费。据有关部门统计，近几年中，温州市的青山绿丘间平均每年要冒出1.5万座坟墓，加上大量祖坟修缮、扩建，全市每年约损失100万平方米山地，毁掉6万株以上树木。
    可以毫不夸张地说，造大坟，已成为破坏生态环境、损害土地资源的一大“公害”。
    令人可喜的是，去年9月，温州市各级人民政府及有关部门下决心发动群众铲除这一“公害”。各地广泛开展移风易俗的宣传，坚决实行殡葬改革。
    同时，全市开展了大规模清理坟山墓地、征收绿化费、严禁造大坟等工作，刹住了乱建和扩建坟墓的歪风。不少地方采取疏导的办法，教育、发动、支持群众利用荒山瘠地建造公墓。到目前为止，全市各县（市、区）已建造公墓112座。这不仅大大节省了土地，而且大大减少了殡葬费用。温州的这一做法，已在浙江全省推广。
    希望更多尚未富裕的地区，接受温州的教训，及早抓思想教育，防止旧习俗抬头，引导农民珍惜家乡的山山水水，不要再演死人与活人争地的闹剧。
