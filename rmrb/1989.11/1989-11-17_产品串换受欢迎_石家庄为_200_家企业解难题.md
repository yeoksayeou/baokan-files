    产品串换受欢迎
    石家庄为200家企业解难题
    本报石家庄11月16日电　新华社记者叶冰男、本报记者陈国琦报道：最近石家庄市举办的一次商品串换交流会，使200多家企业的难题得以解决，与会者纷纷称赞商品串换是目前搞活企业的一个好办法。
    天津市大邱庄油漆厂因资金短缺，原料购不进来。会上他们恰好碰上石家庄市工业品贸易中心有25吨油漆原料积压。双方当即达成协议：油漆厂以市场上适销的白瓷漆、调合漆等换取贸易中心的油漆原料，价值达65万元。获鹿县人民商场用60辆自行车，从石家庄市人民商场换回30台农民欢迎的“威力”洗衣机。据了解，这次串换会商品总成交额达1691万元，串换调剂了4200多种商品。
