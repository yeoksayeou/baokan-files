Title: At the Age of 60, Enthralled by the Analects; At the Age of 80, Writing About Confucius – An Interview with Japanese Writer Inoue Yasushi
Author: Yu Qing
Date: 1989-11-23
Edition: 7

In the season of crimson maple leaves, in a tranquil residential area of Setagaya Ward, Tokyo, the reporter pressed the doorbell of Mr. Inoue Yasushi's home.

Before coming, the reporter learned from the publisher that Mr. Inoue's new book "Confucius" had an initial print run of 36,000 copies, which sold out quickly. Subsequently, the print run was repeatedly increased, and within two months, over 200,000 copies had been distributed. Before publication, Mr. Inoue reminded the publisher to be prepared for potential losses. To this day, the publisher is still amazed that such a highbrow book could cause such a huge sensation. Upon learning that the reporter was also an avid reader of "Confucius," Mr. Inoue happily accepted the interview.

Reporter: What prompted you to write the novel "Confucius"?

Inoue: In my middle school days, I could still recite a few passages of "The Master said..." but later forgot them. After the age of sixty, when one's ears are said to be open to reason, I reread the Analects and became increasingly engrossed, unable to put it down, finding endless joy in it. During this process, I gradually developed the impulse to create. It wasn't that I read the Analects with the intention of writing about Confucius, so the motivation to write "Confucius" arose naturally and spontaneously.

Reporter: From ancient times to the present, there are countless articles and books researching Confucius and the Analects. Writing about Confucius and the Analects in a literary style is filling a gap. Could you share your intentions for this creation?

Inoue: Confucius is not only a sage of Chinese culture but also a teacher for all humanity. The Analects contain many profound truths that should be known by more people. The articles and books by scholars and experts are mainly for exchange among scholars and experts, making it difficult for the general public to accept them. A literary work about Confucius can, through the depiction of the environment and atmosphere, the development of the plot, and easy-to-understand language, subtly introduce Confucius's life experiences and academic thoughts. This is my main intention in writing the novel "Confucius."

Reporter: "Confucius" is nearly 300,000 words long, divided into five chapters. After reading it, I found that each chapter has its own focus, such as the first chapter introducing the historical background and the protagonist, the second chapter discussing "Heaven's Mandate," the third chapter portraying Confucius's disciples, the fourth chapter analyzing "Ren," and the fifth chapter evaluating Confucius and expressing the author's hopes. Is this understanding correct?

Inoue: Yes, it is. I am very happy that more Chinese people can see the book I wrote, so they know that in neighboring Japan, there are also people who deeply respect and admire Confucius.

Reporter: The work fictionalizes a disciple of Confucius, Yanjiang, who, after Confucius's death, recalls, lectures, and discusses Confucius's later years, introducing the academic thoughts of the Analects. This dialogic presentation method is quite unique. Did you consider other presentation methods?

Inoue: No, I did not consider other methods. I believe that this presentation method is appropriate. Confucius's death was followed by the Analects hundreds of years later, and Confucius's teachings were mainly passed down orally by later generations. The form of presentation by Confucius's descendants narrating and discussing is both natural and objective, and it can vividly recreate the historical scenery of that time. Especially to fully display the different views of later generations on Confucius's teachings, it is more appropriate and fitting.

Reporter: You have written many times about Chinese historical themes. How was this time writing about Confucius different from the past?

Inoue: Chinese historical culture is an inexhaustible source of creation. If I have another life, I will definitely go to China to study and create. Writing "Confucius" required reading more books and traveling more. Later generations have different evaluations and annotations of Confucius and the Analects. Finding and comparing in the sea of books is both difficult and enjoyable. Peking University gave me a copy of Mr. Gu Jiegang's edited "Chui Dongbi's Remaining Works," which benefited me greatly. I haven't published other works for over five years, and in recent years, I have been fully immersed in the pile of books related to Confucius and the Analects.

To recreate the historical environment of that time, from 1981 to 1988, I visited Shandong twice and Henan six times, going to Qufu, Zibo, Jinan, Huaiyang, Shangqiu, Yongcheng, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Kuiqiu, Xinzheng, Shangcai, Xincai, Zhuma, Jiyang, Anyang, and Xinyang. (Mr. Inoue showed the 1979 edition of Guo Moruo's "Outline of Chinese History Atlas"). During the field investigations, many new clues different from the book records were discovered. In the writing process, due to doubts about the place name "Fu Han" mentioned in the Analects, I had to stop writing and go to Xinyang, Henan, for an investigation. Every time I went to China, I received help from the Ministry of Culture, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Peking University, Shandong Province, and Henan Province. Without their cooperation, I could not have written "Confucius." Please convey my sincere thanks to them.

Reporter: In the last chapter of "Confucius," the discussions about the hometown lights and the Kuiqiu Conference can evoke readers' reflections on modern society and aspirations for the future.

Inoue: The book indeed incorporates my comments and expectations for the contemporary world. Although separated by more than 2,500 years, many of Confucius's words seem to be addressed to people today. Chinese traditional culture is a precious cultural heritage and also a precious spiritual wealth for the whole world. Absorbing and inheriting the spiritual nutrition from traditional culture and putting it into practice is beneficial for the early realization of the "harmonious human society, peaceful state relations, and a bright world" that I hope for in the book "Confucius."

    耳顺迷《论语》耄耋著《孔子》
　　——访日本作家井上靖
　　本报记者　于青
    枫叶如丹的季节，东京世田谷区一片幽静的住宅区内，记者按响了井上靖先生家的门铃。
    临来之前，记者从出版社获悉，井上先生新著《孔子》第一版印数36000本，面市后很快售罄。随后不断追加印数，两个月内已发行逾20万本。出版之前，井上先生提醒出版社做好赔钱的思想准备。至今，出版社还为这种高格调的书竟引起如此巨大反响感到不可思议。井上先生得知记者也是《孔子》的热心读者，愉快地接受了采访。
    记者：是什么契机使您产生了小说《孔子》的创作冲动？
    井上：中学时代还能背诵出几段“子曰……”，后来都淡忘了。从孔子所说的“六十耳顺”以后，重读《论语》，越读越入迷，竟爱不释手，有其乐无穷之感。在读的过程中，逐渐产生了创作冲动。并不是为了写《孔子》才读《论语》，因此，写《孔子》的动机是偶然地，也是自然地产生的。
    记者：从古到今，研究孔子和《论语》的文章书籍浩如烟海，用文学体裁小说写孔子和《论语》，属于填补空白，请问先生创作意图何在？
    井上：孔子不仅是中国文化的先哲，而且是全人类的老师，《论语》中不乏至理明言，应该让更多的人有所了解。学者专家的有关文章书籍，主要在有关的学者专家之间交流，不易为大多数普通人接受。文学体裁的《孔子》，可以通过环境气氛渲染，故事情节的展开，通俗易懂、潜移默化地介绍孔子的生活经历和学术思想。这是我写小说《孔子》的主要意图。
    记者：《孔子》近30万字，分五章。通读一遍，发现每章各有侧重，如第一章介绍时代背景和主人公。第二章议论“天命”。第三章刻划孔子高足。第四章辩析“仁”。第五章评价孔子并寄托作者的希冀。是否可以这样理解？
    井上：可以。我很高兴能有更多的中国人看到我写的书，使他们知道，在东邻日本也有人对孔子是十分尊重和敬仰的。
    记者：作品中虚构了一个孔子的弟子——蔫薑这个人物，以他在孔子死后的追忆、讲学和聚会讨论的形式，展开孔子晚年经历的故事情节，介绍
  《论语》的学术思想。这种对话式的表现手法很独特。您是否考虑过其他表现手法？
    井上：没有其他考虑。我认为现在这样表现手法是适当的。孔子去世数百年后才有《论语》，孔子的思想学说主要是靠后人口传继承下来的。以孔子的后人讲述和议论的表现形式本身，既可以再现当年的历史风貌，也比孔子本人出场自述显得自然客观。尤其为充分展现后人对孔子某一学说的不同见解，更显得恰当妥贴。
    记者：您多次以中国历史题材写作，这次写《孔子》与过去有什么不同感受？
    新潮社
    井上：中国历史文化是取之不尽的创作源泉，若有再生之年，我定去中国埋头研究创作。写《孔子》，比过去要读更多的书，走更多的路。后人对孔子和《论语》有不同的评价和注释，在书海中寻觅比较，既是难事，也是乐事。北京大学送给我一部顾颉刚先生编订的《崔东壁遗书》，此书令我受益匪浅。我已5年多没发表其他作品，近年全身心浸在有关孔子和《论语》的书堆里。
    为再现当年的历史环境，1981年到1988年间，我两入山东，六下河南，去过曲阜、淄博、济南、淮阳、商丘、永城、郑州、开封、葵丘、新郑、上蔡、新蔡、驻马店、计阳、安阳、信阳等地。（先生拿来1979年版郭沫若著《中国史稿地图集》）。在实地调查中，发现许多与书本记载不同的新线索。在写作中，因对《论语》中提及的“负函”一地名有疑问，不得已停下笔来，亲赴河南信阳考察。每到中国，都得到文化部、中国社会科学院、北京大学、山东省和河南省有关方面的帮助，没有他们的合作，我写不成《孔子》，请代我转达向他们表示至诚的感谢。
    记者：在《孔子》最后一章中，有关故乡灯火和葵丘会议的议论，能唤起读者对现代社会的感慨，对未来的憧憬。
    井上：书中确实融进了我对当今世界的进言和期待。虽然时隔2500多年，孔子的许多话好像就是对当代人说的。中国传统文化是宝贵的文化遗产，也是全世界的宝贵精神财富。吸收继承传统文化中的精神营养并身体力行，有利于尽早实现我在《孔子》书中所希望的“融洽的人类社会，和平的国家关系，一个光明的世界”。（附图片）
