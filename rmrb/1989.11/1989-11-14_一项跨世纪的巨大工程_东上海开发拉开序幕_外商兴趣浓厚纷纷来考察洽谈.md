A century-spanning giant project to attract foreign investment for the development and construction of Eastern Shanghai has been launched. In recent days, representatives from large enterprises and financial institutions in the United States, Britain, Japan, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan, have flocked to Shanghai for inspections and discussions. The Asian Development Bank has sent a senior urban development expert to Shanghai to sign a letter of intent for providing a grant for basic infrastructure planning research.

Foreign experts have dubbed Eastern Shanghai as a "land of opportunity." It refers to the eastern region from the Huangpu River to the mouth of the Yangtze River. Due to transportation barriers, this area has not been well developed and utilized. After extensive investigations and repeated discussions by domestic and foreign experts, the Shanghai Municipal Government decided to accelerate the development of Eastern Shanghai. According to preliminary plans, within a 350-square-kilometer controlled area, nearly 100 square kilometers will be developed this century to build several comprehensive functional zones focusing on ports, energy, petrochemicals, shipbuilding, building materials, export processing industries, as well as finance, commerce, residence, and recreation. By the early 21st century, Eastern Shanghai will be developed into an open, multifunctional modern new district, laying the foundation for Shanghai to become one of the largest economic and trade centers on the western coast of the Pacific Ocean.

Currently, the basic infrastructure work for the development of Eastern Shanghai has partially entered the implementation stage. The first Huangpu River Bridge is ready for preliminary engineering work. The main traffic lines connecting Eastern Shanghai with the old city area are being rapidly constructed. The development of the port, which serves as the gateway to Eastern Shanghai, has also been put on the agenda. Shanghai and the Ministry of Communications have agreed to develop a new port area at Waigaoqiao on the south bank of the Yangtze River estuary.

    一项跨世纪的巨大工程
    东上海开发拉开序幕
    外商兴趣浓厚纷纷来考察洽谈
    据新华社上海11月13日电　（记者夏儒阁）一项筹集外资建设的跨越世纪的巨大工程——东上海开发建设已揭开序幕。连日来，美国、英国、日本以及香港、台湾的一些大型企业集团、金融机构的客商、纷纷来沪考察、洽谈。亚洲开发银行派遣高级城市发展专家来沪草签了提供基础设施规划研究赠款的意向书。
    被外国专家称为“开发宝地”的东上海，是指黄浦江以东直到长江入海口的东部地区。过去由于交通阻隔，这里尚未得到较好的开发利用。经过国内外专家深入考察、反复论证，上海市政府作出要加快开发东上海的决定。据初步规划，在350公里规划控制区域内，本世纪先行开发近百平方公里，建设多个分别以港口、能源、石化、造船、建材、出口加工工业，以及金融、商业、居住、游憩为主要内容的综合功能区。在下个世纪初，要把东上海建设成为开放型、多功能的现代化新区，为上海成为太平洋西岸最大的经济贸易中心之一奠定基础。
    目前，开发东上海的基础设施工作部分已进入实施阶段。第一座黄浦江大桥已作好工程前期准备。与老市区连网的东上海交通干线正加紧修建。作为东上海开放大门的港口建设也提到工作日程，上海与国家交通部已商定在长江入海口南岸的外高桥开辟新港区。
