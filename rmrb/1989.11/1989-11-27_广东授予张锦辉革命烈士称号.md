	Guangdong Confers the Title of Revolutionary Martyr on Zhang Jinhui

	According to a recent decision by the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, the title of "Revolutionary Martyr" has been conferred upon Zhang Jinhui, who bravely fought against a criminal and sacrificed his life.

	Zhang Jinhui was a farmer from Taifeng Village, Xiaolan Town, Zhongshan City. On October 12 of this year, while on the Guangzhou-bound train to Zhengzhou, a criminal snatched a female passenger's handbag and attempted to flee. Zhang Jinhui, who was on the same train, noticed the incident and gave chase. The criminal rushed into the restroom of the carriage, and Zhang Jinhui swiftly followed, grabbing hold of the criminal. Cornered, the criminal pulled out a gun and shot Zhang Jinhui. The 34-year-old Zhang Jinhui died while still tightly gripping the criminal's left leg.
