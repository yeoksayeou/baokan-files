While Japan is vigorously pursuing direct investment abroad, foreign capital is also increasingly engaging in direct investment activities in Japan.

The amount of foreign direct investment in Japan has been steadily increasing. According to materials released by Japan's Ministry of Finance, foreign direct investment in Japan rose from $9.4 billion in 1986 to $22.1 billion in 1987, and further increased to $32.4 billion in 1988. Japanese media reports indicate that over the past three years, more than 350 foreign companies have established subsidiaries in Japan.

In 1988, the largest share of foreign direct investment in Japan came from the United States (55%), followed by Switzerland and West Germany.

Foreign investors have adopted new strategies in expanding their activities in Japan. First, they are establishing new sales centers and processing plants. Second, they are setting up new research and development facilities. Third, they are expanding the sales of imported products. Fourth, they are seeking new sales methods, bypassing Japanese companies to build their own sales channels or engaging in joint ventures. Due to effective management, the average profit rate of foreign enterprises in Japan exceeds that of Japanese companies.

Foreign capital is beginning to enter Japan's high-tech industries. Previously, foreign companies that succeeded in Japan were mainly involved in industries such as oil, machinery, apparel, and luxury goods. Currently, foreign investment is shifting towards technology research and new manufacturing sectors.

Foreign investment in Japan is not without challenges. Foreign companies report encountering six major obstacles. First, the initial investment costs are too high. Renting an office in the central area of Tokyo, for example, requires a deposit of 800,000 to 1.5 million yen for every 3.3 square meters. Second, labor recruitment is difficult. The average hourly wage for manufacturing workers in Japan is nearly 1,500 yen, almost equivalent to that of American workers. Additionally, Japan's lifetime employment system and high bonus system make it challenging for foreign companies to find talented managers and skilled workers. Third, the complex sales system. It is difficult for foreign companies to establish a sales network in Japan. The main reason is the long-standing trade relationships between Japanese suppliers, wholesalers, and retailers. When a retailer opens a new store, it must obtain the consent of nearby small shops according to Japanese law. Fourth, differing management methods. When a foreign company acquires a Japanese enterprise, it is difficult to manage due to a lack of understanding of the company's culture and the country's cross-shareholding system. Fifth, habitual business practices. In Japan, interpersonal relationships play a more significant role than in other countries. Sixth, differing consumer preferences. Japanese consumer preferences pose a challenge for foreign manufacturers, partly because Japanese consumers demand high-quality, well-packaged goods and are less price-sensitive than consumers in other countries.

　　外资在日本投资的新动向
　　薛荣久
    在日本大力对外直接投资的同时，外国资本也开始加强对日本的直接投资活动。
    外国资本在日本直接投资数额不断扩大。据日本大藏省发布的材料，外国在日本的直接投资从1986年的9.4亿美元增加到1987年的22.1亿美元，1988年进一步增加到32.4亿美元。日本报刊指出，在过去的三年里，已有350家以上的外国大公司在日本建立了子公司。
    1988年，外国资本在日本的直接投资，美国资本占第一位（55％），其余是瑞士和西德资本。
    外国在日本扩大投资活动中采取了新的作法。第一、建立新的销售中心和加工厂。第二、建立新的研究和开发设施。第三、扩大进口产品的销售活动。第四、寻求新的销售方式，撇开日本公司建立自己的销售渠道或搞合资企业。由于经营得法，外国在日本的企业的平均利润率超过日本企业。
    外国资本开始进入日本高科技产业。以往，在日本取得成功的外国公司一直从事石油、机器、服装和奢侈品等产业。当前，外国资本投资已转向技术研究与新制造业。
    外国资本进入日本不是一帆风顺的。外国公司抱怨在日本投资时遇到六大障碍。第一、开始投资费用过高。在日本东京中心地区租一间办公室，每3.3平方米的保证金就高达80万到150万日元。第二、雇工难。日本制造业工人平均每小时工资近1500日元，几乎与美国工人相同，再加上日本的终生雇佣制和高奖金制，使外国公司很难找到有才干的管理人员和熟练工人。第三、复杂的销售系统。外国公司在日本建立销售网十分困难。主要原因是日本的供应商、批发商与零售商之间有着长久的贸易关系。一个零售商新开一个商店时，按照日本的法律，它必须要取得附近地区小商店的同意。第四、管理方法不同。外国公司在日本购买一家日本企业时，由于不了解日本公司的文化和国家的交叉持股制度，很难经营。第五、习惯性的商业作法。在日本多年来已形成的人际关系比起其他国家起更大的作用。第六、消费者的爱好不同。日本人的消费爱好使外国厂商头疼，其部分原因是日本人要求商品质量要好、包装要漂亮、讲究，不像其他国家的消费者重视价格。
