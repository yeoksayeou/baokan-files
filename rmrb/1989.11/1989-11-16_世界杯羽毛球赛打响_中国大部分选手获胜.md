Reporter Huang Zhenzhong reports from Guangzhou, November 15th: The world's top badminton players began their World Cup tournament today in Guangzhou. The Guangzhou Sports Gymnasium's four courts were filled with the swift movements of shuttlecocks, as the intense matches drew cheers from thousands of spectators. China's men's and women's singles teams all won their matches. In men's doubles, Li Yongbo and Tian Bingyi defeated Japanese players, while in women's doubles, Lin Ying and Guan Weizhen also emerged victorious.

China's veteran player Zhao Jianhua was the first to win, defeating Malaysia's Rahsidik with a score of 2:0. Yang Yang and Xiong Guobao followed, each defeating Britain's D. Hall and Thailand's Chiu Songpeng with scores of 2:0. In women's singles, Tang Jiuhong, with her small braid, secured a victory, and Han Aiping easily defeated Indonesia's Sarwendah with a score of 2:0. Huang Hua struggled but managed to tie with Denmark's N. Nielsen at 1:1. She played aggressively, with powerful smashes, but seemed a bit impatient. Under the guidance of her old coach, she hit the ball to the baseline, and when her opponent returned it, she jumped to smash it, disrupting the opponent's rhythm and quickly winning the third set.

One of the "Four Heavenly Kings," Indonesia's "Black General" Sugiarto, combined attack and defense to defeat Denmark's I. Frederiksen. Indonesia's young player Adi and Wang Lianxiang also advanced smoothly, but Luo Tianning was defeated by Denmark's N. Nielsen. China's men's doubles team Chen Kang and Chen Hongyong, and women's doubles team Sun Xiaoqing and Zhou Lei, had an unsuccessful start, losing to Indonesia and South Korea's veteran players.

    世界杯羽毛球赛打响
　　中国大部分选手获胜
    本报广州11月15日电　记者黄振中报道：世界羽毛球佼佼者今天开始在广州进行世界杯赛。广州体育馆4个场地上羽毛球穿梭如飞，打得十分激烈，激起数千观众阵阵掌声。中国队男单、女单全胜。男双李永波、田秉毅击败日本选手，女双林瑛、关渭贞亦获胜。
    中国队老将赵剑华率先以2∶0胜马来西亚拉·西德克，继而杨阳、熊国宝分别击败英国达·霍尔和泰国邱颂蓬，比分均为2∶0。女子单打，先是扎着小辫的唐九红报捷，接着韩爱平以2∶0轻取印尼萨尔文达。黄华久攻不克，同丹麦的尼德加尔德打成1平。她打得凶猛，劈杀有力，但显得比较急躁。在老教练的指点下，她将球击到底线，当对手回球时跳起劈杀，凌厉的攻势，打乱了对方的阵脚，第三局很快得胜。
      “四大天王”之一的印尼“黑将军”苏吉亚托，今天攻防结合胜了丹麦的伊·弗雷德里克森。印尼的年青选手阿迪和王莲香也顺利过关，罗天宁却倒在丹麦尼尔霍夫拍下。中国的男双陈康、陈红勇和女双孙小青、周雷出师不利，分别败在印尼和南朝鲜老将拍下。
