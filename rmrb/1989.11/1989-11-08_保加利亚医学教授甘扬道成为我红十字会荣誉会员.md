Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 7th.

Today, in the conference hall of the Chinese Red Cross Society, the smiling Bulgarian medical professor Ganyandao became the center of attention—this old friend of the Chinese people was awarded the honorary membership of the Chinese Red Cross Society.

Ganyandao is over seventy years old, but 50 years ago, he bravely led the international medical team to come to China. At that time, the conditions were extremely harsh and dangerous, but Ganyandao and his colleagues, disregarding their own safety, overcame difficulties and joined the Chinese Red Cross Society rescue team. They rescued many wounded soldiers and civilians from the brink of death, contributing to the victory of the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the international medical team coming to China to participate in rescue work. Nearly one hundred members of the Chinese Red Cross Society attended the ceremony today where Ganyandao was awarded the honorary membership of the Chinese Red Cross Society.
