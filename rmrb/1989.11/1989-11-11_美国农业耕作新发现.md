	Recently, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences discovered that fields with minimal or no use of pesticides and fertilizers have yields almost equal to those that use these chemicals. The institution suggested changing the federal government's subsidy policy for farms, encouraging the adoption of natural farming techniques.

	The National Academy of Sciences' agricultural department began this research in 1984. Experts carefully observed fourteen farms in seven states. In Knox County, Ohio, one farm uses crop rotation and cultivators to control weeds, applying animal manure as fertilizer. For fifteen years, it has not used chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides. Its corn and soybean yields are 32% and 40% higher, respectively, than the county's average.

	This is the first time American scientists have affirmed that biological interactions can replace chemical substances.

	The U.S. federal government's farm subsidy policy has been in place for over forty years. Currently, about one dollar is subsidized for every bushel of corn produced; this year, the federal government's farm subsidies totaled $1.39 billion. While welcoming the National Academy of Sciences' research report, the U.S. Department of Agriculture believes that society is highly concerned about food safety, water quality, and ecological environment protection. It is timely to consider changing the direction of American agricultural cultivation.

    美国农业耕作新发现
    本报记者　仓立德
    最近，美国全国科学院发现，施用少量或不施用杀虫剂和化肥的农田，其产量几乎与施用化肥和杀虫剂的农田相同。该机构建议改变联邦政府对农场的补贴政策，鼓励采用自然耕作技术。
    全国科学院农业部是一九八四年开始这项研究的，有关专家仔细观察了七个州的十四家农场。在俄亥俄州诺克斯县，一家农场使用轮作、锄草机来控制杂草，施用牲畜粪肥，十五年来从未使用化肥、杀虫剂及除草剂，其玉米和大豆却比该县平均产量分别高百分之三十二和百分之四十。
    这是美国科学家首次肯定用生物的相互作用可以替代化学物质。
    美国联邦政府对农场补贴政策已实施四十余年。目前每生产一蒲式耳玉米就要补贴约一美元；今年联邦政府的农场补贴高达一百三十九亿美元。美国农业部在欢迎全国科学院的研究报告的同时认为，目前全社会高度关注食品安全、水质及生态环境的保护，现在考虑改变美国的农业耕作方向是适时的。
