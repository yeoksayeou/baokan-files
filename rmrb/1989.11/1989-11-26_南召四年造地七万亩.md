South Chuan Creates 70,000 Mu of Land in Four Years

People's Daily reports that South Chuan County in Henan Province, where each person has only 7 mu of arable land, has invested 10.7 million yuan to develop mountainous areas. Since 1986, the county has created 71,000 mu of new terraced farmland, equivalent to increasing the fixed arable land by 1.5 mu per agricultural population.

This county is one of the poorest in Henan. The county committee and the county government believe that developing industry and activating circulation are necessary, but agriculture is the foundation. They decided to make developing wasteland into farmland a strategic measure to strengthen the roots and strengthen the foundation. To this end, they formulated preferential policies to encourage farmers to develop land. Every winter and spring, the entire county mobilizes 130,000 laborers to develop land.

　　南召四年造地七万亩
    本报讯　人均只有7分耕地的河南省南召县集资1070万元开发山区。1986年以来，全县新造坡耕地7.1万亩，等于每个农业人口增加固定耕地1.5分。
    这个县是河南贫困县之一。县委、县政府认为，发展工业、搞活流通是必要的，但农业是基础。他们决定把荒坡造地作为强根壮本的战略措施来抓。为此，制订了鼓励农民造地的优惠政策。每年冬春，全县日出动13万劳力造地。　（徐自明　牛明海）
