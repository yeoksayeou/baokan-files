A new method for determining the levels of nicotine and cotinine in the bodies of smokers using urine has been successfully developed by the Tianjin Institute of Occupational Health. The method has recently passed expert appraisal.

The impact of smoking on human health has long been a concern for society. Previously, determining the nicotine levels in smokers required measuring micro-quantities in plasma, a method that was complex and not suitable for large-scale investigations. Experts believe that this new method, which uses just 2 milliliters of urine to determine nicotine and cotinine levels in the body, is simple to operate and easily accepted by the public, offering significant social benefits.

    人体尼古丁含量有多少用两毫升尿液即可测定
    新华社天津11月7日电  （记者孙永盛）从尿中测定吸烟者体内尼古丁和柯的宁含量的新方法，由天津劳动卫生研究所在国内首先研究成功，日前通过专家鉴定。
    吸烟与人体健康早已引起社会重视。但过去了解吸烟者体内尼古丁含量，都是通过测定血浆微量，方法复杂不便于大范围调查。专家们认为，这种用2毫升尿液便可测定人体内尼古丁、柯的宁含量的方法，操作简单，易被群众接受，有明显的社会效益。
