A wave of agricultural water conservancy construction is sweeping across the country, and the situation is promising. However, there is one issue that deserves attention: the need to emphasize practical results. There are indeed lessons to be learned in this regard.

A certain county launched agricultural water conservancy construction last year, mobilizing tens of thousands of people and moving tens of thousands of cubic meters of soil and stone. However, due to a significant shortage of "three materials" (cement, steel, and timber), the constructed facilities were not compatible, and the project did not yield benefits the following year. In the summer, the water washed away many of the improved ditches, causing them to silt up.

A colleague from the Ministry of Water Resources who oversees agricultural water conservancy work told the reporter that similar situations have occurred to varying degrees in many places during past agricultural water conservancy construction projects. Agricultural water conservancy projects need to be large-scale and spectacular; otherwise, it is difficult to achieve results. However, they must also emphasize practical results, aiming to complete each project and provide tangible benefits to farmers.

After the State Council issued the "Decision on Vigorous Promotion of Agricultural Water Conservancy Basic Construction," various regions quickly took action. From south to north, water conservancy construction sites can be seen everywhere, with a scale seldom seen in recent years. However, the larger the scale and the more people involved, the more precious the people's resources and labor become. Farmers are very practical; they say, "We don't mind hard work, but we hate working in vain." If they exert great effort and see no results the following year, their enthusiasm will be dampened, and water conservancy construction may quickly shift from being spectacular to becoming cold and desolate.

Emphasizing benefits is key. Various levels of leadership must change their work style, starting from local realities, and plan construction carefully. They should not mobilize farmers without a clear plan, leading to a waste of manpower and resources. For large-scale projects that affect a wide area, even more caution and meticulous planning are required. In the Jianghan Plain of Hubei, there are vast areas of low-lying, low-yield fields. In the past, due to insufficient drainage facilities, only one season of low-yield rice could be planted per year. Last year, the Ministry of Water Resources conducted soil drainage improvement pilot projects in Honghu and Qianjiang, achieving significant results. Crops changed from one season to two, and yields increased substantially. Farmers saw the benefits and this year eagerly requested guidance from relevant departments to build water conservancy projects. Currently, tens of thousands of laborers from more than ten counties are engaged in drainage construction.

In agricultural water conservancy construction, in addition to labor, there are many things that farmers cannot handle on their own. They hope that the leadership will provide good services and solve some practical problems. In northern China, there are millions of acres of arid farmland suitable for promoting pipeline irrigation, which saves water, electricity, and land. Compared to canal irrigation, water utilization efficiency can be increased to 50%. However, due to a shortage of plastic pipes, farmers are helpless. If relevant local departments and units work together to solve this problem, water conservancy construction can achieve great results. Many local leaders participate in labor on the construction sites, which greatly motivates farmers. However, farmers hope that leaders not only set an example but also do practical work, solve problems on-site, and address the actual difficulties in water conservancy construction.

This year, Shandong Province decided to invest over 300 million yuan in agricultural water conservancy construction, ensuring the allocation of funds and materials. The material supply department of Tai'an City went to great lengths to organize supplies, securing 12,000 tons of cement, 500 tons of steel, and 375 cubic meters of timber from the plan, meeting the needs of water conservancy construction. Henan Province is responsible for materials and oil at various levels, collecting from multiple sources, and prioritizing supply to ensure there are no shortages. The leaders of the Zhuangzhou Regional Government held on-site offices, immediately solving 630 tons of diesel for construction and addressing some economic disputes by dispatching public security officers to the construction site for security work. The facts show that as long as various levels of leadership truly value water conservancy construction, many problems are not difficult to solve.

Following the water conservancy competitions in Liaoning ("Da Yu Cup"), Jilin ("Tianchi Cup"), and Heilongjiang ("Heilong Cup") in previous years, this year, Hebei, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Shanxi provinces and regions have launched water conservancy competitions centered on agricultural water conservancy construction, such as the "Haihe Cup," "Tianshan Cup," "Jinlong Cup," and "Yuwang Cup." This method introduces a competitive mechanism, with counties as units to compete; in terms of fund use, it changes the previous method of scattering funds like pepper, implementing a reward-subsidy system, with good results. However, during the competition, it is crucial to avoid formalism; otherwise, the competition will lose its meaning. Since the beginning of last year, Henan Province has conducted county-level certification activities based on the increase in irrigation area. The provincial government and the Water Resources Department signed a contract, and the Water Resources Department allocated indicators to each county, signing contracts with county governments, linking water conservancy construction with project benefits and grain yield. In the past two years, the province has increased several million acres of drought-resistant and flood-resistant fields each year.

A colleague from the Ministry of Water Resources told the reporter that although the momentum of agricultural water conservancy construction this year is good, development is still uneven across regions. Judging from the pre-allocated agricultural water conservancy funds, the current national total has not exceeded 200 million yuan. They are concerned that the water conservancy funds for this winter and next spring may not reach or exceed the 2.1 billion yuan level of 1980. This indicates that necessary fund investment cannot be relaxed.

### 讲求实效——农田水利建设中值得注意的问题

　　讲求实效
　　——农田水利建设中值得注意的问题
　　本报记者　高保生
    一个农田水利建设的热潮正在各地兴起，形势是喜人的。但有一个问题值得注意，那就是注意讲求实效的问题。这方面是不乏教训的。
    某县去年搞农田水利建设，上了几万人，动了几十万土石方。可是后来由于“三材”缺口大，建筑物不配套，第二年工程非但没发挥效益，夏天水一冲，连许多改造过的沟渠都淤了。
    水利部主管农田水利工作的一位同志告诉记者，像这样的情况，在过去农田水利建设中，不少地方不同程度存在。办农田水利，既要有规模，轰轰烈烈，否则难以奏效；又要讲求实效，争取办一项成一项，让农民得到实实在在的好处。
    国务院发布《关于大力开展农田水利基本建设的决定》后，各地迅速行动，从南到北，到处可看到水利建设工地，声势之大，多年少见。然而，规模越大，出工越多，越要珍惜民财民力。农民最讲实际，他们说，我们不怕苦干，就怕白干。如果出了大力，第二年见不到实效，农民的积极性就会受挫，水利建设就可能由轰轰烈烈很快变成冷冷清清。
    注重效益，关键是各级领导转变思想作风，从当地实际情况出发，搞好建设规划，不能还没有什么谱儿，就盲目地把农民发动起来，造成人力物力的浪费。对规模较大和涉及面较大的工程，更应慎重，筹划周密。湖北江汉平原有大片低洼低产田，过去因排水设施不足，一年只能种一季低产水稻。去年水利部在洪湖、潜江等地搞土壤排水改造试点，取得明显效果，作物由一季变为两季，产量大幅度提高。农民看到后，觉得这是一本万利的事，今年纷纷要求业务部门前往指导兴修水利。目前，十几个县的几十万劳力上阵，投入排水工程建设。
    在农田水利建设中，除了出工出劳外，有许多事是农民自身难办到的。他们要求领导搞好服务，切切实实解决一些实际问题。我国北方有几百万亩干旱耕地，宜于推广管道灌溉，既节水，又省电，不占地。与渠道灌溉比，水的利用率可提高到50％。可是目前由于塑料管材料紧缺，农民无能为力。如果有关地方有关部门协同解决这个问题，水利建设便可大有作为。许多地方领导带头参加工地劳动，这对调动农民积极性作用很大。但农民要求领导不仅要做出样子，还要真办实事，现场办公，解决水利建设中的实际困难。
    山东省今年决定拿出3亿多元投入农田水利建设，做到资金、物资落实。泰安市物资部门千方百计组织货源，从计划内解决1.2万吨水泥、500吨钢材、375立方米木材，保证了水利建设需要。河南省对物资、油料分级负责，多方筹集，优先安排，保证供应，不留缺口。驻马店地区行署领导现场办公，当场解决施工用柴油630吨，并针对一些经济纠纷，抽调公安干警参与工地治安工作。事实说明，只要各级领导真正重视了水利建设，一些难题并不难解决。
    继前些年辽宁“大禹杯”、吉林
  “天池杯”、黑龙江“黑龙杯”水利竞赛开展后，今年河北、新疆、内蒙古、山西等省区又兴起了以农田水利建设为中心的“海河杯”、“天山杯”、“金龙杯”、“禹王杯”竞赛。这种办法引入竞争机制，以县为单位开展竞赛；在资金使用上改变过去撒胡椒面的办法，实行以奖代补，效果很好。但在竞赛过程中，切忌形式主义，不然就失去了竞赛的意义。河南省从前年开始，根据灌溉面积的增长开展达标县活动，省政府与水利厅签订承包合同，水利厅把指标分解到各个县，与县政府签订合同，把水利建设与工程效益、粮食产量挂起钩来。近两年来，全省每年新增几千万亩旱涝保收田。
    水利部的同志告诉记者，今年农田水利建设虽然势头很好，但各地发展还不平衡。从农田水利经费的预拨来看，目前全国还没有超过2亿元。他们担心今冬明春的水利经费能否达到和超过1980年21亿元的水平。这说明，必要的资金投入也是不能放松的。
