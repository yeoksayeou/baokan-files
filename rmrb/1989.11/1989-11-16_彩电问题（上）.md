Color Television Problems (Part 1)

Reporter: Pí Shùyì

Color televisions have become a problem again. This time, it is not the consumers who are troubled by not being able to buy color televisions, but the manufacturers who are worried about not being able to sell them. One year ago, color televisions were the most sought-after commodity on the Chinese market. Some people even spent several hundred or thousands of yuan to obtain a ticket for a color television. One year later, color televisions have become the first commodity to be affected by the market slump. Despite the fact that each television in the store showcases its features vividly, and despite some stores offering discounts, such as giving away quartz clocks or blankets with the purchase of a television, there are still not many buyers.

According to statistics, by the end of September, the industrial inventory of color televisions was 1.4 million units, and the commercial inventory was 600,000 units, totaling more than 2 million units. Even if each unit is priced at 2,000 yuan, it would amount to more than 4 billion yuan in inventory. Some color television enterprises are facing difficulties due to poor cash flow.

The situation has changed dramatically, and color televisions have once again sparked discussions and reflections among people. What is wrong with the color television market?

By the end of 1988, the national color television penetration rate was: 44 units per 100 urban households and 2.8 units per 100 rural households. Relevant departments predicted that the demand for color televisions this year (at 1988 prices) would be 14 million units, with the state planning to produce 8.6 million units, leaving a supply gap of 5.4 million units. However, the reality is that color televisions are piling up in large quantities.

The sluggishness of the color television market shares common causes with the overall market slump: the rectification and control of demand have shown results. According to the National Bureau of Statistics' survey of more than 30,000 urban households, the actual income of households, after deducting the price factor, decreased by 2.6% in the first half of the year. Banks have opened value-preserving savings, attracting more than 90 billion yuan in household savings in the first eight months. Additionally, last year's blind buying spree has led to a portion of purchasing power being realized in advance. These factors have led to a decrease in social purchasing power this year. The stabilization of the market has also made consumers more rational in their purchases, even to the point of holding onto their money and waiting for price drops.

The sluggishness of the color television market also has its unique characteristics. Starting from February this year, the state implemented a monopoly policy on color televisions, while also levying a special consumption tax and a domestic development fund. This has played a positive role in rectifying the circulation order of color televisions, stopping resale speculation, curbing excessive demand, and stabilizing the color television market. However, it has also led to some unforeseen problems.

Before the monopoly, everyone—industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and the military—sold color televisions. Everyone, including state-owned, collective, and individual entities, could engage in the business. After the monopoly, the chaotic situation changed, with state-owned stores becoming the sole operators. However, the number of sales outlets has significantly decreased. Shanghai originally had more than 2,000 color television sales points, but after the monopoly, only 1/10 remain. In many regions, there is only one or two monopoly points in a county. Stores that sell color televisions have to pay the consumption tax in advance, thus incurring more loan interest. The commercial sales rebate rate is also not high, making it possible for stores to lose money if they are not careful. The low enthusiasm of stores to sell color televisions, coupled with the reduction in monopoly points, has to some extent affected the sales of color televisions.

After levying the consumption tax and the domestic development fund, the price of color televisions has increased significantly. The price of an 18-inch color television has increased by 900 yuan (600 yuan for consumption tax and 300 yuan for the domestic development fund), making it 2,700 to 2,800 yuan per unit, almost the same as last year's black market price. The price of a 14-inch color television has increased by 500 yuan (400 yuan for consumption tax and 100 yuan for the domestic development fund), making it more than 1,800 yuan per unit, exceeding last year's black market price. During last year's buying spree, consumers were in a blind state and might not have felt the black market price was too high. However, once the market stabilized, consumers became more rational, and such high prices became difficult to accept. Those who had not bought color televisions before mostly had lower incomes and found it hard to accept the price of a color television, which was equivalent to a worker's one or two years of income. According to a survey by the Urban Socio-Economic Investigation Team of Shenyang, by the end of September this year, 35% of households did not have a color television. Among these households, 96% subjectively wanted to buy a color television, but 57% of the households (mostly middle-aged people) had many family members and low per capita income. Although they had saved for many years, they still did not have enough. The remaining 39% of households were waiting for a price drop.

The levying of the color television consumption tax is the first time in China that a tax has been imposed on consumers. Such a major change was introduced without the necessary publicity and explanation. When the price tags including the consumption tax appeared on the counters, they were met with complaints from consumers: What is this consumption tax? Isn't it just a disguised price increase! Some consumers said that those with money and power had already bought color televisions at the official price, and now that we have finally saved enough money to buy a color television, we have to pay taxes. A survey by the Urban Socio-Economic Investigation Team of Yichang showed that a considerable number of consumers have objections to the levying of the color television consumption tax and the domestic development fund.

The combination of monopoly and consumption tax has suppressed the activity of the color television market. No wonder some people say, if you levy taxes, don't implement the monopoly; if you implement the monopoly, don't levy taxes. You only need to control one aspect.

Learning to regulate the market, especially using the price lever effectively, choosing the right fulcrum, and controlling the force, is not an easy task. It requires continuous practice and experience. The law of value is unyielding. The combination of planned economy and market regulation is to learn to use the law of value.

The state has taken some measures: increasing the number of monopoly points, allowing qualified collective stores to sell color televisions; providing interest subsidies for commercial loans to pay the consumption tax; and providing some loans to the commercial sector to purchase color televisions, thereby playing the role of a commercial reservoir. Color television factories are also actively offering discounts and using various promotional methods. It is understood that the sales volume of color televisions in September has increased.

What is worrying is that from January to August this year, 344,000 foreign color televisions were imported, using nearly 100 million US dollars in foreign exchange. The large-scale import of color televisions is another blow to the already sluggish color television market.

    彩电问题（上）

    彩电又成了问题
    这一次，不是消费者为买不着彩电而苦恼，而是厂家为卖不出彩电而发愁。一年前，彩电还是中国市场上最紧俏的商品，有人甚至为得到一张彩电票而花费几百元、上千元。一年后，彩电成了市场疲软中首当其冲的商品，尽管一台台彩电在商店柜台上“声情并茂”，尽管有的商店让利销售，买一台彩电，或送石英钟，或送毛毯……可是问津者并不多。
    据统计，到9月底，工业库存彩电140多万台，商业库存60多万台，共计200多万台。仅以一台2000元计算，就积压资金40多亿元。一些彩电企业资金周转不灵，陷于困境。
    风云突变，彩电又一次引起人们的议论；由热变冷，彩电又一次引起人们的思索。
          彩电市场怎么了？
    到1988年底，全国彩电普及率：城镇每百户44台，农村每百户2.8台。有关部门预测，今年彩电需求量（按1988年价格）为1400万台，国家计划安排生产860万台，供需缺口540万台。然而，现实却是彩电大量积压。
    彩电市场疲软与当前整个市场疲软有共同的原因：治理整顿，控制需求，见了效应。据国家统计局对全国城镇3万余户居民家庭货币收入调查，上半年家庭生活费收入扣除物价因素，实际下降2.6％；银行开办保值储蓄，前8个月就吸收了900多亿元的居民储蓄；加之去年的盲目抢购，一部分购买力提前实现，这些因素导致了今年社会购买力的下降。市场平稳使消费者心理趋稳，冷静选购，甚至持币待购，也是一个因素。
    彩电市场疲软也有其特殊性。从今年2月起，国家对彩电实行专营，同时征收特别消费税和国产化基金，这对整顿彩电流通秩序，制止转手倒卖，抑制过旺需求，稳定彩电市场，起了积极作用。但是也产生了一些始料不及的问题。
    专营前，工农商学兵，大家卖彩电，全民、集体、个体，谁都可以经营；专营后，改变了混乱状况，由国营商店独家经营，但是销售网点大量减少。上海原有2000多个彩电销售点，专营后，只剩下1／10。不少地区一个县只有一两个专营点。经销彩电的商店要先垫付消费税，因而要多负担贷款利息，商业销售回扣率也不高，弄不好经营彩电就要赔钱，商店经营积极性不高。专营点少，又不愿意经销，在一定程度上影响了彩电销售。
    征收消费税和国产化基金后，彩电价格大幅度提高。18英寸彩电提高900元，（600元消费税、300元国产化基金），二千七八百元一台，与去年黑市价相差无几，14英寸彩电提高500元（400元消费税、100元国产化基金），1800多元一台，超过了去年黑市价。在去年的抢购风潮中，消费者处于盲目状态，对黑市价格可能并不觉得太高，可是一旦市场平稳，消费者冷静下来，这样高的价格就难以接受了。原来未买彩电的消费者大多收入水平不高，面对价格相当于一个职工一两年收入的彩电，只好“望洋兴叹”。据沈阳市城市社会经济调查队对300户城市居民家庭的抽样调查，到今年9月底，没有彩电的家庭占35％。在这些家庭中，主观上愿意购买彩电的占96％，其中有57％的家庭（多为中年人）由于家庭人口较多，人均收入较低，虽然积蓄了多年，但仍然不够。其余39％的家庭持币待购，等待降价。
    征收彩电消费税，是我国第一次对消费者征税。这么一项重大的变革，出台时鸦雀无声，没有进行必要的宣传解释。当彩电价格包括消费税的牌子出现在柜台上时，惹来的是消费者的一片抱怨：什么消费税，还不是变相涨价！有的消费者说，有钱有势的早买了平价彩电，如今我们好不容易攒了钱，要买彩电了，却要征税。宜昌市城市社会经济调查队的调查表明，相当多的消费者对征收彩电消费税和国产化发展基金有异议。
    专营与消费税双管齐下，抑制了彩电市场的活跃。怪不得有人说，征税就别专营，专营就别征税，两者抓住一头就够了。
    学会调节市场，特别是运用好价格杠杆，选准支点，把握力度，并不是一件容易的事，需要不断实践，不断总结经验。价值规律铁面无私。计划经济与市场调节相结合就是要学会运用价值规律。
    国家已采取了一些措施：增加专营点，够条件的集体商店也可以销售；对商业垫付消费税的贷款给予贴息；给商业一部分贷款作收购彩电用，以发挥商业的蓄水池作用。彩电工厂也在纷纷向商业让利，采取多种手段促销。据了解，9月份彩电销售量已有所增加。
    令人忧虑的是，今年1至8月进口国外彩电34.4万台，用汇近1亿美元。彩电的大量进口对已经疲软的彩电市场又是一个冲击。
