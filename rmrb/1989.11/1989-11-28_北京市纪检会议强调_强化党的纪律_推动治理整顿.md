	Beijing Municipal Discipline Inspection Conference Emphasizes Strengthening Party Discipline and Promoting Rectification

	BEIJING, Nov. 27 (Xinhua) — Meng Zhi Yuan, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission, said at today's municipal discipline inspection work conference that the current task is to firmly combat the phenomena of "orders not followed, prohibitions not heeded" and "you have policies, I have countermeasures," while also emphasizing the importance of strengthening positive education for Party members.

	He said that by learning from and publicizing the advanced deeds of Party members who strictly adhere to Party discipline, we can educate Party members and Party leaders to voluntarily uphold the principles of democratic centralism, maintain the overall situation, and uphold the unity and solidarity of the Party. They should correctly handle the relationship between local and overall interests, and correctly handle the interests of the state, collective, and individuals. They should vigorously promote the spirit of hard work, selflessness, and public service.

	Meng Zhi Yuan pointed out that various levels of discipline inspection commissions should, under the leadership of the Party committees, work with the organizational departments to conduct a thorough investigation and examination of cadres. Various levels of discipline inspection commissions should also take concrete measures to implement the work of strict Party governance and the punishment of corrupt practices. For all complaints and appeals to the discipline inspection departments involving Party members, the discipline inspection departments have the responsibility to directly handle them or to work with relevant departments to handle them. Those involving violations of political discipline and legal discipline should be handled by the supervisory and judicial departments, respectively. Law enforcement and disciplinary enforcement departments should have clear divisions of labor and coordinate and cooperate with each other.

	Meng Zhi Yuan pointed out that further strengthening the investigation and handling of major and important cases is an important task in strengthening Party discipline. For major and important cases, the main leaders of the Party committees and discipline inspection commissions should personally oversee them, follow them through to the end, and achieve the comprehensive effect of "investigating one case and educating a group."

　　北京市纪检会议强调
　　强化党的纪律　推动治理整顿
    本报北京11月27日讯　中共北京市纪委书记孟志元在今天举行的全市纪检工作会议上说，当前抓党的纪律教育工作，既要同“有令不行，有禁不止”和“你有政策，我有对策”的现象作坚决斗争，又要注意加强对党员的正面教育。
    他说，要通过学习和宣传一批严格遵守党纪的党员的先进事迹，教育党员和党员领导干部自觉地坚持党的民主集中制原则，维护大局，维护党的团结统一；正确处理局部与全局的关系，正确处理国家、集体、个人之间的利益，大力提倡艰苦奋斗、克己奉公的精神。
    孟志元指出，各级纪委还要在党委领导下，结合清查、清理，会同组织部门搞好干部考察工作。各级纪委还要采取切实措施，把从严治党、惩处腐败现象的工作落到实处。凡控告、申诉到纪检部门的案件，涉及到党员的，纪检部门都有责任直接查处，或会同有关部门进行查处，属于违反政纪和法纪的，分别由监察部门和司法部门作出查处。执法执纪部门，既要有原则分工，又要协调配合。
    孟志元指出，进一步抓好大案、要案的查处工作，这是强化党纪的一项重要工作。对大案、要案，党委、纪委主要领导干部要亲自过问，一抓到底，达到“查处一件、教育一片”的综合效果。		（颜世贵　王华轩　黄智敏）
