The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Martyrs Cemetery, located at Songhwa Mountain in Kaesong, is surrounded by green pines and is solemn, dignified, and very clean.

In the center of the cemetery stands a white marble stele. The front side is inscribed with the words, "The martyrs who fought in the War to Resist America and Aid Korea, and defended their homeland, will be remembered forever!"

When the reporter arrived at the gravesite, he saw the elderly caretaker, Huang Shānfēng, trimming the flowers and grass. Thirteen years ago, when the reporter first came to Kaesong to pay respects at the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Martyrs Cemetery, he met Huang Shānfēng. Huang Shānfēng is originally from Changfeng County, Kaesong. Thirty-nine years ago, when the Volunteer Army came to Changfeng County, his family voluntarily vacated their home to let the Volunteer Army live there. During the battle, he served as a guide for the Volunteer Army. When the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army advanced south, his entire family and the villagers together built bridges, delivered supplies, and transported ammunition for the troops.

In 1957, Huang Shānfēng volunteered to become the caretaker of the cemetery. Over the past 32 years, he has managed the gravesite meticulously. The thousands of trees he planted have grown into a forest, and the dozens of varieties of flowers and grass he transplanted are lush and vibrant. On the day the reporter visited the Martyrs Cemetery, he noticed a layer of freshly laid soil on the ground. Upon inquiry, it turned out that the previous night there had been a rainstorm, and the rainwater had washed out a ditch in the cemetery. Huang Shānfēng had spent the entire morning shoveling and filling in the ditch. When talking about this, Huang Shānfēng said, "This is what I should do. Seeing the martyrs rest peacefully here brings me great comfort."

Huang Shānfēng told the reporter that every year on Qingming Festival and October 25th, the leaders and people of Kaesong City, along with the staff of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Liaison Office in Kaesong, come here to sweep the graves. The Kaesong City Party Committee often uses the vivid stories of the two countries' people fighting side by side to educate the youth, ensuring that the friendship between China and Korea is passed down from generation to generation.

    32年守陵人
    本报记者　徐宝康
    座落在开城松岳山的中国人民志愿军烈士陵园，为青松环抱，庄严肃穆，十分整洁。
    陵园中央矗立着一块汉白玉石碑，正面刻着“抗美援朝，保家卫国的烈士们，永垂不朽！”
    记者来到墓前，看见守陵老人黄善峰正在修剪花草。13年前，记者第一次来开城瞻仰志愿军烈士陵园时便与黄老人相识。黄善峰原籍开城长丰郡。39年前，志愿军部队来到长丰郡时，他们一家主动把房子腾出来让给志愿军部队住。战斗中，他为志愿军当向导。在志愿军和朝鲜人民军向南推进时，他们全家和村民一道，为部队架桥，送粮，运弹药。
    1957年，黄善峰自愿报名担任守陵人。32年来，他把墓地管理得井井有条。他种下的上千棵树木，已长大成林，移栽的几十种花草，如茵似锦。记者来到烈士陵园的那天，看见地面上有一层刚刚铺垫过的新土。一打听，原来是昨晚下了一场雨，雨水把墓地冲刷出了一条水沟。黄善峰老人这一天一清早就一锹一锹地把水沟填平了。谈起这件事，黄善峰老人说：“这是我应该做的。看到烈士们能够安静地休息在这里，我感到莫大的安慰。”
    黄善峰老人告诉记者，每年的清明节和10月25日，开城市党政机关领导和群众都要同中国人民志愿军驻开城联络处的同志们一道，来这里扫墓。开城市党委还经常以朝中两国人民并肩战斗的生动事迹，教育青年把朝中友谊世世代代传下去。（附图片）
