The People's Liberation Army Jinan Military Region held a training class for high and intermediate level cadres, focusing on how to better adhere to the Party's basic line in practice and study Marxist theory.

The military region's Party Committee organized various levels of leading cadres to engage in on-the-job learning, starting from the beginning of this year, conducting training in batches to systematically study relevant philosophical works of Marxism, as well as the theories of Deng Xiaoping and other revolutionary elders on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The aim is to dialectically, historically, and comprehensively grasp the essence of the Party's basic line in the socialist stage, to overcome blindness and subjective arbitrariness.

So far, such training classes have been held continuously for three sessions, training more than 400 division and regiment level cadres. Through the training, everyone has a clearer understanding of major principle issues such as "Why China must choose the socialist path and cannot take the capitalist road," "Why the Chinese revolution and construction must be led by the Communist Party," and "Why reform and opening up is a historical choice."

High and intermediate level cadres participating in the training reflected on their actual work during the theoretical study and believed that the following issues need to be addressed at present: First, it is necessary to genuinely overcome the subjectivity and metaphysics in propagating and implementing the Party's basic line. There are many lessons to be learned in this regard. For example, some comrades, when explaining the superiority of socialism, would describe socialism as flawless, making people unaware of the necessity of reform; while emphasizing the necessity of reform, they would describe socialism as worthless. For another example, after abandoning the line of "class struggle as the key link," some comrades ignored "class struggle within a certain range" until the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion occurred, as if waking from a dream. All these indicate that mastering a scientific worldview and methodology is the ideological foundation for correctly implementing the Party's basic line, and efforts must be made to solve this problem. Second, it is necessary to guide the overall situation with the Party's basic line. As high and intermediate level cadres of the Party, it is particularly important to have a clear mind and be sober-minded. Third, it is necessary to strengthen the coordination among party, government, enterprise, and military cadres, ensuring that the Party's basic line permeates all specific work. Good institutions formed over the decades should be upheld. New effective institutions should also be explored continuously. In implementing the Party's basic line, it is absolutely not allowed to "have one person with one trumpet, each blowing their own tune."

The Jinan Military Region's training of high and intermediate level cadres in batches has significantly improved the awareness of implementing the Party's basic line. Currently, all units in the region are seriously studying the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee. Military training, production, construction, and other work are also going well.

    济南军区高中级干部轮训班强调
    以党的基本路线统揽全局
    新华社济南11月2日电　（记者王志耘、谭道博）人民解放军济南军区举办高中级干部轮训班，围绕如何更好地在实践中坚持党的基本路线，学习马克思主义理论。
    军区党委在组织各级领导干部搞好在职学习的同时，从今年初开始分期分批轮训高中级干部，组织大家系统地学习马克思主义的有关哲学著作，以及邓小平等老一辈革命家有关建设有中国特色的社会主义理论，力求辩证地、历史地、全面地把握党在社会主义阶段的基本路线的实质，以克服盲目性和主观随意性。
    到目前为止，这样的轮训班已直接连续办了3期，轮训师、旅以上领导干部400多名。通过轮训，大家对“中国为什么要选择社会主义道路而不能走资本主义道路”、“中国革命和建设为什么必须由共产党领导”、“改革开放为什么是历史的选择”等重大原则问题，有了更加清醒的认识。
    参加轮训的高中级干部在理论学习中，对实际工作进行了认真的反思，认为，当前要特别注意解决好以下几个问题：一是要切实克服宣传贯彻党的基本路线中的主观片面性和形而上学。这方面有很多教训值得记取。比如有些同志要说明社会主义优越性时，就把社会主义说得完美无缺，使人看不到改革的必要性；而在强调改革的必要性时，又把社会主义说得一无是处。再比如，否定了“以阶级斗争为纲”后，有的同志对“一定范围内的阶级斗争”视而不见，直至发生了动乱和反革命暴乱才如大梦初醒。凡此种种说明，掌握科学的世界观和方法论是正确执行党的基本路线的思想基础，要下功夫解决好。二是要以党的基本路线统揽全局。作为党的高中级干部，尤其要做到全局在胸，头脑清醒。三是要增强党政、政企、军政干部的合力，做到分工不分家，保证党的基本路线渗透到各项具体工作中。对于这方面几十年来形成的好制度要坚持下去。还要不断探索新的行之有效的制度。在执行党的基本路线问题上，决不能“一人一把号，各吹各的调”。
    济南军区分期分批轮训高中级领导干部，大大提高了贯彻党的基本路线的自觉性，目前，全区部队正在认真抓好党的十三届四中全会精神的学习。军事训练、生产、施工等工作也搞得有声有色。
