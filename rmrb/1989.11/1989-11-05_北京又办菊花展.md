The "Beijing Municipal 10th Chrysanthemum Exhibition," themed "Pine Cranes for Longevity and Everlasting Peace," recently opened at Beihai Park.

Beijing has a long tradition of cultivating chrysanthemums and has held nine previous exhibitions. In 1986, Beijing designated chrysanthemums along with roses as the "city flower."

In recent years, Beijing's chrysanthemum cultivation techniques have seen new developments, earning praise from both domestic and international visitors.

The exhibition is divided into eight halls, covering an area of 1,500 square meters. The main hall features over 1,000 pots of Canadian chrysanthemums arranged into a sun, pine, and crane motif, highlighting the theme of this year's exhibition.

    北京又办菊花展
    本报讯　以“松鹤延年长治久安”为主题的“北京市第十届菊花展览”，日前在北海公园展出。
    北京艺菊素有优良传统，已举办了九届北京市菊展。一九八六年，北京把菊花同月季花一起定为“市花”。
    近年来，北京菊花的栽培技艺有新的发展，受到国内外人士交口称赞。
    菊展分为八个展室，占地一千五百平方米。主展室用一千余盆加拿大盆菊插花组成的太阳松鹤图，突出了这次菊展的主题。
