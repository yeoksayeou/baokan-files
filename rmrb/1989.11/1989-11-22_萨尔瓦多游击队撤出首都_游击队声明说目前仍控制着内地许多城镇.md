Xinhua News Agency, San Jose, November 20th.

After 8 days of intense fighting, the Salvadoran guerrillas withdrew from their positions in the northwestern district of the capital, San Salvador, on the 20th. The war-torn mountain city is gradually returning to calm.

After withdrawing from the capital, the guerrillas issued a statement saying that their ability to fight in the capital for 8 days and nights demonstrated their strength. The guerrillas still control many towns and strategic locations in the countryside. On the 20th, while the guerrillas were withdrawing from the capital, another guerrilla force attacked the important city of Sacatecoluca, 50 kilometers from San Salvador. The guerrillas have taken control of an area of 6,000 square kilometers nationwide and established "local people's governments."

Reports indicate that the Salvadoran government is still taking a hardline stance, rejecting calls for a ceasefire from the public and refusing mediation. President Cristiani claimed on the 20th that the government forces have defeated the guerrillas and will control the national situation in a very short time.

Reports say that since the guerrillas launched a massive offensive on the night of the 11th, at least 1,000 people from both the guerrillas and government forces have been killed, and more than 1,000 have been injured. Additionally, more than 1,000 civilians have been injured or killed in the fighting. The guerrillas have shot down or destroyed 12 government fighter jets and helicopters, and 34 tanks, armored vehicles, and military patrol cars. This is the most intense battle since the start of the Salvadoran civil war 10 years ago.

　　萨尔瓦多游击队撤出首都
　　游击队声明说目前仍控制着内地许多城镇
    新华社圣何塞11月20日电　圣萨尔瓦多消息：经过8天的激战之后，萨尔瓦多游击队20日撤出了在首都圣萨尔瓦多西北区的阵地。这座饱经战火的山城已逐步恢复平静。
    游击队在撤离首都之后发表声明说，它能在首都坚持作战8天8夜，显示了它的强大力量。游击队目前仍然控制着内地的许多城镇和战略要地。20日，在游击队撤离首都的同时，另一支游击队攻打了距圣萨尔瓦多50公里的重镇萨卡特科卢卡市。游击队已控制了全国6000平方公里的面积并建立了“地方人民政府”。
    据报道，萨尔瓦多政府目前仍持强硬态度，不同意舆论界的停火建议，也不接受调停。克里斯蒂亚尼总统20日声称，政府军已打败了游击队，将会在极短的时间内控制全国局势。
    据报道，自游击队11日晚发动强大攻势以来，游击队和政府军至少有1000多人丧生，1000多人受伤，另有1000多居民在战火中伤亡。游击队共击落或击毁政府军战斗机和直升机12架，击毁坦克、装甲车和军用巡逻车34辆。这是萨尔瓦多内战爆发10年来最激烈的一次战斗。
