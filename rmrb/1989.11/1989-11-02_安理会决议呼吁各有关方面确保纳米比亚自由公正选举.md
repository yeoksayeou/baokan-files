The UN Security Council today unanimously adopted a resolution calling on all parties concerned, particularly South Africa, to immediately and fully implement the Security Council's Resolution 435 and other resolutions regarding Namibia's independence, ensuring that Namibia holds free and fair elections under UN supervision.

The meeting was held at the request of the African countries' representative from Kenya and after multiple consultations among the Security Council members. The meeting reviewed the "serious situation in Namibia" and reached a consensus on the draft resolution.

The resolution demands that South Africa, in accordance with Security Council Resolution 435 and other resolutions, completely disband its paramilitary forces, tribal forces, commando units, and especially the riot control units and the South West African Territorial Force that it has supported. It also demands the complete withdrawal of the command structures of these forces and the replacement of former South African defense personnel working in the "Ministry of Defense" of Namibia.

The resolution requires South Africa to immediately abolish all restrictive and discriminatory laws and regulations that hinder the holding of free and fair elections in Namibia, including the relevant proclamations establishing the apartheid system.

Finally, the resolution calls on the South West African Police to fully cooperate with the police personnel of the UN Assistance Mission to facilitate their task of supervising the election process.

Namibia is scheduled to begin its independence elections on November 7, but South Africa has not yet fully implemented all the provisions of Security Council Resolution 435.

    安理会决议呼吁各有关方面确保纳米比亚自由公正选举
    本报联合国10月31日电　记者刘开宸报道：联合国安理会今天一致通过一项决议，要求有关各方，尤其是南非，立即充分执行关于纳米比亚独立的安理会435号等决议，确保纳米比亚在联合国监督下举行自由、公正的选举。
    会议是应非洲国家集团代表肯尼亚的要求，并经安理会理事国多次磋商后才召开的。会议审议了“纳米比亚当前的严重局势”，就该决议草案达成了协商一致意见。
    决议要求南非按照安理会435号等决议，彻底解散它在纳米比亚的准军事部队、部落部队、突击队，特别是南非扶植的防暴队和西南非洲领土部队，彻底撤除这些部队的指挥机构，并撤换转到纳米比亚“国防部”工作的原南非国防军人员。
    决议要求南非立即废除所有妨碍纳米比亚举行自由、公正选举的限制性和歧视性法律和条例，包括废除建立种族管理制度的有关公告。
    决议最后要求南非的西南非警察向联合国援助团的警察人员提供充分的合作，便于他们执行监督选举进程的任务。
    纳米比亚将于11月7日开始独立选举，但南非尚未完全执行安理会435号决议的各项规定。
