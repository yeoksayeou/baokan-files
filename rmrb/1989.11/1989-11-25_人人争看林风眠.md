Everyone wants to see Lin Fengmian, especially those who love the arts. Last month, the Taipei Historical Museum held an exhibition of Lin Fengmian's paintings, fulfilling the long-held wishes of compatriots in Taiwan. This exhibition of Lin Fengmian's paintings at the China Art Museum in Beijing is also a rare opportunity. I hope that those who are interested will visit the exhibition hall to listen to the comments and exclamations of the audience!

It is not just because Lin Fengmian is a ninety-year-old veteran artist, not just because he has made great efforts and contributions to the art education of our motherland, and not just because he has been quietly cultivating art in adversity for more than seventy years. The high praise from domestic and international public opinion is mainly focused on his outstanding achievements in the unique fusion of Chinese and Western art.

The exchange of Eastern and Western cultures is an inevitable trend in the progress of human civilization. The mutual absorption and fusion of Chinese and Western painting also belong to the objective law that is not subject to human will. In the Qing Dynasty, Chinese-style oil portraits appeared, and the author's name is obscure, which was already a hybrid of Chinese and Western cultures. Standing tall and entering the palace, the most well-known pursuit of a Chinese-Western fusion style is Lang Shining. This Italian missionary mainly sought to please the emperor, and he worked hard to combine Chinese and Western painting. We cannot erase his merits and hard work. We celebrate success and also pay attention to the lessons of failure. In my personal opinion, Lang Shining was a failure in art. His works lack aesthetic appeal. He used Western realistic techniques to depict Chinese subjects, pursuing likeness and three-dimensional effects to cater to the low-level appreciation. This kind of painting, limited to technical fusion, was easy to gain an audience at that time and played a role in popularization, and it also influenced many people who followed this wrong path of Chinese-Western fusion. Lang Shining did not understand the value of aesthetics. He did not realize the different manifestations of Western and Chinese aesthetics in works.

In summary, Western painting emphasizes visual images, and visual beauty is the main body of painting; Chinese painting emphasizes emotion, and the painting focuses on the creation of the artistic conception. Mr. Cai Yuanpei once made a concise comparison: Western painting is close to architecture, and Chinese painting is close to literature. Lin Fengmian's focus and starting point for the fusion of Chinese and Western cultures is aesthetics. He deeply understood the aesthetic sentiments of both Chinese and Western cultures, absorbed the essence of the aesthetic factors of both sides, and strove to explore their intersection, creating a new aesthetic realm and giving birth to a new being that inherits the advantages of both parents rather than their disadvantages. He values the composition, expansion and contraction of forms, and the resonance and mutual penetration of colors in the West... He absorbs the lyrical brushwork, folk charm, and profound artistic conception of China... He integrates the rhythm of the West with the charm of China. This is the value of Lin Fengmian. In the fusion of Chinese and Western cultures, he has enlightened the key issues of artistic fusion. Whether looking from the East to the West or from the West to the East, one will see an independent Lin Fengmian.

The old man never talks about the long and difficult years he has experienced, but people can feel the bitterness, joy, innocence, dreams, pain, and faint sorrow of life from his numerous works... lone wild geese, fishing boats, vast sky, crimson flowers, naked figures, stern nuns, the magic lotus lamp, reed fields... people under the brush, heaven and earth in the painting.

Lin Fengmian never preaches, but his works move people. However, his moving works have been under criticism for a long time, and his original works have not been seen in the country for a long time. The works exhibited this time are those he donated to the motherland when he left Shanghai in 1977, which have been sleeping in the warehouse of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts for more than ten years. They were first exhibited at the Shanghai Art Museum last year and are now finally meeting the audience in the capital.

Through the joint efforts of various parties, it has been planned to restore Lin Fengmian's former residence in Hangzhou, establish an exhibition hall for these works, and erect a statue in his hometown. A patriotic overseas Chinese has decided to fund the construction of the museum. But Mr. Lin wrote in a letter expressing his polite refusal, saying that it is not urgent to build the museum, that building the museum is not a pressing matter, and that it should be done when the country has the conditions. He also strongly opposes the erection of a statue. If there are funds, it is better to support young people to further their studies. In the letter, he also emphasized that he is already so old and hopes that his opinion will be respected. Someone suggested sending a delegation to Hong Kong to persuade Mr. Lin, but I estimate that it will not be effective, because Mr. Lin is not easily persuaded.

Lin Fengmian is Lin Fengmian.

　　人人争看林风眠
　　吴冠中
    人人争看林风眠，尤其爱好文艺的人们争看林风眠。上个月台北历史博物馆举办林风眠画展，满足了台湾同胞多年的愿望。这次北京中国美术馆举办的林风眠画展也确是难得的良机，愿有心人到展厅中听听观众们的评议和感叹！
    不仅是由于林风眠已是九十高龄的老画家，不仅是由于他曾为祖国的艺术教育事业作出过极大的努力和贡献，不仅是由于他长期在逆境中为艺术默默耕耘了七十余年，海内外舆论对他的崇高评价，主要是着眼于他在中、西艺术结合中作出了独创性的杰出成就。
    东、西文化交流是人类文明进步的必然趋向，中、西绘画的相互吸取和结合也属不以人们意志为转移的客观规律，清代出现的中国风格油画肖像，作者轶名，那已是中西结合的混血儿了。堂堂正正，步入宫廷，追求中西结合画风而最为人熟知的是郎世宁。这个意大利传教士主要为讨好皇上，在中、西绘画结合中煞费苦心，在实践中留下了不少作品。我们不可磨灭他的功劳和苦劳，我们庆贺成功，也重视失败的教训。我个人认为郎世宁在艺术上是失败的，他的作品缺乏美感。他用西方的写实技巧来套中国题材，一味追求形似及立体感等效果以迎合低层次的欣赏水平。这种局限于技法结合的画面在当时容易获得观众，起了普及作用，而且影响了许多人后来跟着走这一条中、西结合的歧途。郎世宁不理解审美价值，他根本未意识到西方审美观和中国审美观在作品中的不同体现。
    概括地看，西方绘画重视视觉形象，视觉美感是绘画的主体；中国绘画偏重情意，画面着力于意境的经营。蔡元培先生曾作过简约的比较：西方绘画近建筑，中国绘画近文学。林风眠中西结合的着眼点和出发点是审美观。他深深体会了中、西方的审美情致，吸取双方美感因素的精华，努力探索其交汇点，创造了新的审美境界，诞生了继承父母双方优点而绝不是缺点的新生儿。他重视西方的构成、形体的扩展与紧缩、色彩的呼应和相互渗透……他吸取中国抒情的挥毫、民间的真趣、深邃的意境……他将西方的节律感与中国的韵味溶为一体。这是林风眠的价值，他在中、西结合中启示了艺术结合的关键问题。从东方向西方看，从西方向东方看，都会看到独立存在的林风眠。
    老人对所经历的漫长苦难岁月从不诉说，人们却能从他大量作品中去体会人生的苦闷、欢乐、天真、梦幻、痛苦、淡淡的哀愁……孤雁、渔舟、苍茫的天、猩红的花、舒展的裸体、严峻的修女、宝莲灯、芦花荡……笔底人间，画里乾坤。
    林风眠从不教训人，而以其作品感人，然而感人的作品曾长期处于被批判中，国内已很久很久看不到他的原作。这次展出的作品是他一九七七年离开上海时赠送给祖国的，在上海画院仓库里沉睡了十余年，去年首次在上海美术馆展出，今天终于与首都观众见面了。
    经多方面的协作努力，已计划恢复杭州林风眠故居，建立这批作品的陈列馆，并在他家乡立铜像，一位爱国华侨已决定出资建馆。但林先生来信表示婉谢，说不急于建馆，建馆不是要事，待国家有条件时再说，更反对造铜像，如有经费，宜先资助青年深造，信中并强调他已这么大年纪了，希望尊重他的意见。有人建议派个代表团去香港说服林先生，我估计不起作用，因林老师是不易被说服的。
    林风眠就是林风眠。
