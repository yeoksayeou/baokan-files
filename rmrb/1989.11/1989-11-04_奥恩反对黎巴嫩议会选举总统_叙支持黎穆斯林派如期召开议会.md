	Newspaper Report from Beijing, November 3rd: A compilation of reports from our correspondents in Beirut and Damascus.

	Lebanese Christian militia leader Aoun stated on the 2nd that he opposes hasty presidential elections. Meanwhile, Syrian President Assad discussed with the leaders of the main Lebanese Muslim factions how to ensure the timely and successful convening of the Lebanese parliament.

	According to a local radio broadcast in Beirut, Aoun issued a statement on the 2nd, warning Lebanese Parliament Speaker Hussein not to continue violating the constitution, and accused him of "setting more obstacles for the presidential election negotiations."

	Aoun also warned that if the parliament convenes to pass the "National Reconciliation Charter" of the Taif Agreement and conduct a presidential election, he "will be forced to take decisive measures."

	This is Aoun's first response after Hussein called for the parliament to convene on the 4th to elect a president and speaker.

	According to sources in Beirut, the proposed parliamentary session may be postponed for a few days to give Lebanese Christian parliamentarians the final chance to persuade Aoun to stop opposing the Taif Agreement.

	However, Hussein told the press on the 2nd that the parliamentary session will be held as scheduled on the 4th. The Arab League envoy Ibrahim is also in Beirut making intense efforts for this purpose.

	Meanwhile, according to reports from Damascus, Syrian President Assad met on the 2nd with the leader of the Lebanese Shia Muslim "Amal" movement, Berri, and the leader of the Lebanese Muslim Progressive Socialist Party, Jumblatt. They discussed how to ensure the timely and successful convening of the Lebanese parliament. They decided to support the "National Reconciliation Charter" of the Lebanese parliament's Taif Agreement with reservations, hoping that the proposed parliamentary session will be held as scheduled.

    奥恩反对黎巴嫩议会选举总统
    叙支持黎穆斯林派如期召开议会
    新华社北京11月3日电  综合本社驻贝鲁特和大马士革记者报道：黎巴嫩基督教军政府领导人奥恩2日表示，反对草率进行黎总统选举。同时，叙利亚总统阿萨德同黎穆斯林主要派别领导人讨论如何保证黎议会会议如期成功召开。
    据贝鲁特地方电台广播说，奥恩2日发表声明，告诫黎巴嫩议长侯赛尼不要继续违反宪法，并指责他“为总统选举的协商设置更多障碍”。
    奥恩还警告说，如果召开议会会议来通过塔伊夫会议的“民族和解宪章”并进行总统选举的话，他“将被迫采取断然措施”。
    这是自侯赛尼呼吁在4日召开议会会议选举总统、议长后，奥恩所作的第一次反应。
    据贝鲁特有关人士说，拟议中的黎议会会议也许要推迟几天召开，以给黎基督教议员最后的机会劝说奥恩停止反对塔伊夫协议。
    但侯赛尼2日对新闻界说，议会会议要在4日如期召开，阿盟特使易卜拉希米也正在贝鲁特为这一目的而紧张努力。
    另据大马士革消息，叙利亚总统阿萨德2日会见了黎什叶派穆斯林“阿迈勒”运动领导人贝里和黎穆斯林社会进步党领导人琼卜拉特，讨论了如何保证黎议会会议如期成功召开的问题。他们决定，有保留地支持黎议会塔伊夫会议的“民族和解宪章”，希望拟议中的黎议会会议如期举行。
