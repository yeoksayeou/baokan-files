OPEC Increases Oil Production

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Paris, data provided by the International Energy Agency on November 3rd indicates that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) produced an average of 22.9 million barrels of oil per day in October, an increase of 500,000 barrels per day compared to September, accounting for 40% of the world's total oil production in that month.

OPEC had set its production quota for the fourth quarter of this year at 20.5 million barrels per day in late September. This means that the average daily production in October exceeded the quota by 2.4 million barrels.

Oil industry experts believe that before the OPEC ministerial meeting scheduled for November 25th, countries such as Saudi Arabia have been increasing their oil production. The goal is to address the issue of reallocating production quotas at this meeting.

    欧佩克石油增产
    据新华社巴黎电　据国际能源机构11月3日提供的数据，石油输出国组织（欧佩克）今年10月份的平均日产量达2290万桶，比9月份的平均日产量多50万桶，占当月世界石油总产量的40％。
    欧佩克今年9月下旬曾确定其第4季度的生产限额为每天2050万桶。这就是说，10月份的日均产量超过其限额240万桶。
    石油界人士认为，在11月25日欧佩克部长级会议召开前，沙特阿拉伯等国一直在提高石油产量，目的是要在这次会议上解决重新分配生产配额的问题。
