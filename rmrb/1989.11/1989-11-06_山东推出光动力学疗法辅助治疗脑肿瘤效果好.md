Medical staff from the Neurosurgery Department of Shandong Medical University Affiliated Hospital and the Laser Department of Shandong Provincial Tumor Prevention and Treatment Research Institute have collaborated to study the use of photodynamic therapy to assist in the surgical treatment of brain tumors. They have achieved more satisfactory results compared to using only surgical methods to remove tumors.

The two medical institutions in Shandong used surgical methods to remove brain tumors and then used laser irradiation of the tumor cavity to treat intracranial malignant tumors. Since January 1988, they have used this method on 30 brain tumor patients. Practice has proven that this is a safe and effective new method.

    山东推出光动力学疗法辅助治疗脑肿瘤效果好
    新华社济南11月5日电  （记者刘关权）山东医科大学附属医院神经外科和山东省肿瘤防治研究院激光科的医务人员协作研究，运用光动力学疗法辅助外科手术治疗脑肿瘤，获得了比单纯采用外科手术切除肿瘤更为满意的疗效。
    山东两家医疗单位采用外科手术切除脑肿瘤后，再用激光照射瘤腔治疗颅内恶性肿瘤，自1988年1月起，先后为30例脑肿瘤患者使用了这种方法，实践证明，这是一种安全、有效的新方法。
