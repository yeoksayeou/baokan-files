Stimulants have long been a hot commodity in Japan's black market for drugs, with an increasing number of users each year. Incidents of suicide, murder, and other serious crimes due to excessive stimulant use frequently make headlines. According to recent revelations from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, international drug traffickers annually smuggle nearly 20 tons of stimulants into Japan, making 2 million people addicted. Japanese anti-drug officials are concerned that the 1990s may see a second wave of stimulant abuse sweeping across the entire Japanese archipelago.

Stimulants differ from other drugs in that, according to pharmacology, they are classified as "mild drugs." However, they are easy to store and transport, and their profits are unparalleled among all types of drugs, making them a primary source of income for Japanese organized crime syndicates.

There are two main secret routes for stimulants entering Japan: one through the Taiwan Strait and the other via the waters around South Korea. The methods of smuggling are constantly evolving. The final transaction price for 1 gram of stimulants can reach 200,000 yen, four times the original price. Therefore, some desperados are willing to take risks. Statistics show that out of Japan's 45,065 known gang members, half are directly involved in the smuggling of stimulants. Currently, Japanese law enforcement is struggling to find effective measures to eradicate the rampant use of stimulants and is merely reacting to the situation.

　　兴奋剂恣肆日本列岛
    兴奋剂在日本的药品黑市交易中历来十分走俏，滥用者逐年增多，因过量服兴奋剂导致自杀身亡、谋财害命的恶性案件屡见报端。据日本警视厅最近透露，国际贩毒分子每年把将近20吨的兴奋剂倾入日本市场，200万人成了兴奋剂的嗜好者。日本政府缉毒官员担心，进入90年代，整个日本列岛将面临兴奋剂的第二个“滥用时代”。
    兴奋剂不同于其它毒品，根据药理学，它属于“柔和型毒品”，但是，它易储，易运，其利润居各类毒品之首，所以成了日本黑社会暴力团伙牟取暴利的主要源泉。
    兴奋剂流入日本的秘密途径有两条，一是经台湾海峡，二是过南朝鲜海域，贩运手法亦在不断翻新。1克兴奋剂脱手后的最终成交价高达20万日元，比原价高4倍。因此，一些亡命之徒不惜铤而走险。据统计，日本全国45065名暴力成员有半数直接参与了兴奋剂的走私活动。目前日本警方对滥用兴奋剂之风尚无根除的良策，还只是穷于应付。（赵建航编译）
