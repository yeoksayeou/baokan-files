Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 9th. (Correspondents Mǎ Déxiù, Reporter Jiāng Zàizhōng) The reporter learned from the State Planning Commission that, in order to strengthen scientific research on population control, China recently decided to establish two national key laboratories in Beijing and Shanghai.

The two laboratories are named the Reproductive Physiology Laboratory and the Family Planning Contraceptive Laboratory, respectively. Family planning not only plays an important role in the development of the national economy but is also a factor in improving the quality of China's population. In recent years, China has made significant achievements in the research and development of family planning drugs and contraceptives. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of long-term effectiveness, convenience, and lack of side effects, especially in basic research, where there are some urgent issues that need to be addressed. The construction of these two laboratories aims to strengthen both basic and applied research in the field of family planning science.

It is understood that the construction of these two laboratories was carried out through a bidding process. Experts conducted a strict and fair evaluation of the 10 family planning research institutions that participated in the bidding. Ultimately, it was decided that the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Shanghai Institute of Family Planning Scientific Research, which have relatively high levels of infrastructure and research, will undertake the construction of these two laboratories.

    加强计划生育科学研究
    国家决定建两个重点实验室
    新华社北京11月9日电 （通讯员马德秀、记者姜在忠）记者从国家计委获悉，为了加强人口控制的科学研究，我国最近决定在北京和上海各建立一个计划生育国家重点实验室。
    这两个实验室分别名为生殖生理实验室和计划生育药具实验室。节制生育不仅在国民经济发展中占有重要地位，而且也是提高我国人口质量的因素之一。近年来，我国在计划生育药物药具研究领域取得了很大成绩，但在长效、方便、无副作用等方面仍不尽如人意，特别在基础研究方面，遇到了一些亟待解决的课题。这两个实验室的建设，旨在加强计划生育科学中的基础研究和应用研究。
    据了解，为建设这两个实验室实行了招标。专家们通过对参加招标的10家计划生育科研机构进行严格、公正的评审，最后确认基础设施和科研水平较高的中科院动物研究所、上海计划生育科学研究所承担这两个实验室的建设。
