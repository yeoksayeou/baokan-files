The 44th session of the United Nations General Assembly on November 16 passed a resolution on the situation in Cambodia with an unprecedented overwhelming majority of 124 votes. The resolution sternly demanded that Vietnamese troops withdraw under UN supervision, and that a temporary coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk be established to comprehensively resolve the Cambodian issue politically. The adoption of this resolution once again exposed Vietnam's "complete withdrawal" as a sham, demonstrating the just stance and common aspirations of the vast majority of countries in the world.

The draft resolution, proposed by ASEAN countries, maintained the main content of the resolutions on Cambodia passed by the previous 10 sessions of the UN General Assembly. It demanded that Vietnam stop its aggression and military occupation of Cambodia, allowing the Cambodian people to exercise their right to self-determination without external interference. The draft explicitly pointed out that Vietnam's claim of having "withdrawn from Cambodia" is invalid. During the one-and-a-half-month consultation process, many country representatives requested to join the joint proposal. By the time of the vote, the number of joint proposers reached 79, 15 more than the previous session. This fully illustrates the principle that "justice is on the side of the many, injustice is on the side of the few."

The Vietnamese representative also spoke at length today about the "new developments" in the situation in Cambodia, falsely claiming that by the end of September this year, Vietnam had left not a single soldier in Cambodia, boasting about the significance of its "final withdrawal," and complaining that this year's resolution did not reflect the new developments, still insisting on the "old views and old positions" of the past 10 sessions.

Vietnam's self-performance exposed its true intentions: first, to change the essence of the Cambodian issue from Vietnam's aggression and Cambodia's counter-aggression; second, to avoid the two key issues in the comprehensive political resolution of the Cambodian issue—Vietnam's complete and genuine withdrawal from Cambodia and the establishment of a temporary coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk.

At this session of the General Assembly, the international community did not recognize Vietnam's "complete withdrawal," thus shattering Vietnam's schemes.

In the first phase of the general debate at this session of the General Assembly, many country representatives questioned the reliability of Vietnam's withdrawal. In the past two days, when the General Assembly specifically discussed the Cambodian issue, many country representatives further pointed out that Vietnam's announcement of withdrawal while avoiding UN supervision is not credible; the nature of the Cambodian issue has not changed, and the responsibility for its resolution still lies with Vietnam. UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar also pointed out in his report to the General Assembly on the situation in Cambodia that Vietnam's notification of withdrawal, without verification by an effective international organization, cannot be an important factor in the political resolution of the Cambodian issue.

Eleven years ago, Vietnam invaded Cambodia, creating the Cambodian issue. Now, it is setting up numerous obstacles, hindering the political resolution of the Cambodian issue, and going against the current trend of peaceful resolution of regional conflicts. If Vietnam wants to gain the trust of the international community, it must change its attitude of confrontation with the international community, comply with the resolutions of the General Assembly, and thus enable the Cambodian issue to be resolved comprehensively, justly, and durably as soon as possible.

    人们不信越南的“撤军”花招
    ——评四十四届联大通过柬埔寨局势决议
    本报记者　刘开宸
    第44届联合国大会11月16日以124票的空前压倒多数，通过了柬埔寨局势的决议草案，严正要求越南军队在联合国监督下真正撤出，成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府，全面政治解决柬埔寨问题。该决议的通过，再次戳穿了越南“全部撤军”的幌子，表明了世界上绝大多数国家的正义立场和共同愿望。
    由东盟国家起草的决议草案，保持了前10届联大通过的柬埔寨问题决议的主要内容，要求越南停止对柬埔寨的侵略和军事占领，让柬埔寨人民在没有外来干涉的情况下行使其自决权。草案针对越南的“撤军”的新花招明确指出，越南自己宣称“已从柬埔寨撤军”是无效的。在一个半月的磋商过程中，许多国家代表纷纷要求加入共同提案国。至草案表决时止，共同提案国多达79个，比上次多15个。这充分说明，“得道多助，失道寡助”。
    越南代表今天也在会上大谈柬埔寨形势的“新发展”，谎称今年9月底以前，越南未在柬埔寨留下一兵一卒，吹嘘它“最后撤军”的意义重大，并抱怨今年决议未反映新进展情况，仍坚持过去10届决议的
  “老观点、老立场”，等等。
    越南的自我表演暴露了它的真正意图：一要改变柬埔寨问题是越南侵略和柬埔寨反侵略的这一实质；二要避开全面政治解决柬埔寨问题的两个关键问题——越南全部地、真正地从柬埔寨撤军和建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府。
    本届联大上，国际社会不承认越南的“全部撤军”，这就粉碎了越南的图谋。
    在本届联大前一阶段的一般性辩论中，许多国家代表对越南撤军的可靠性提出质疑。这两天联大专门审议柬埔寨问题时，许多国家代表进一步指出，越南有意避开联合国的监督而宣布撤军是不可相信的；柬埔寨问题的性质未变，解决的责任仍在于越南，联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔在给联大的关于柬埔寨局势的报告中也指出，越南通知他的撤军，未经有效国际机构核实，不能成为政治解决柬埔寨问题的一项重要因素。
    11年前，越南侵略柬埔寨，制造了柬埔寨问题，现在又设置重重障碍，阻挠着柬埔寨问题的政治解决，违背目前和平解决地区冲突的趋势。越南如欲取信于国际社会，只有改变与国际社会对立的态度，遵守联大决议，从而使柬埔寨问题早日获得全面、公正和持久的解决。（本报联合国11月16日电）
