The Western Pacific is a major oceanic region influencing global climate change. Chinese scientists, after conducting a five-year scientific expedition in the Western Pacific, have reached this conclusion.

Chinese researchers discovered that the Western Pacific experiences intense solar radiation, with the sea absorbing a large amount of heat, making it the world's largest "heat reservoir." Due to the combination of various atmospheric factors, the Western Pacific is the birthplace of typhoons and directly influences global and Chinese climate variations from year to year.

Based on observations and a large amount of collected data, the "El Niño" phenomenon, which affects global climate change, is closely related to the Western Pacific. Before the onset of "El Niño," the water temperature in the Western Pacific rises sharply. During "El Niño," the warm water layer on the surface of the Western Pacific becomes significantly thinner, and its heat is transmitted in some form to the Eastern Pacific, stabilizing the atmosphere above the sea. After "El Niño," the high-temperature water in the Western Pacific thickens and moves significantly eastward.

The relationship between the Western Pacific and global climate is a research gap for scientists worldwide. Since 1985, six institutions under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, including the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology and the Beijing Institute of Atmospheric Physics, have jointly conducted scientific expeditions in the Western Pacific. They have set up over 400 observation points, obtaining a wealth of firsthand atmospheric research data from the Western Pacific, which has attracted the attention of some scientists worldwide who study the relationship between the ocean and climate.

　　我国科学考察发现
　　西太平洋最能影响全球气候
    新华社广州11月26日电　西太平洋是影响全球气候变化的主要海域。我国科技人员对西太平洋海域进行5年的科学考察后，得出这样的结论。
    我国考察人员发现，西太平洋太阳辐射强烈，海水吸收热能多，是世界上最大的“热水库”，由于大气及多种因素的偶合，西太平洋是台风的发源地，是直接影响全球和我国气候年际变化的海域。
    根据观测和收集到的大量资料分析，影响全球气候变化的“厄尔尼诺”现象，也同西太平洋密切相关。“厄尔尼诺”前期，西太平洋水温会骤增。“厄尔尼诺”期间，西太平洋表面的暖水层会明显变薄，其热量以某种形式向东太平洋传播，海域上空大气稳定。“厄尔尼诺”之后，西太平洋的高温水会变厚，并显著东移。
    西太平洋海域同全球气候的关系，是世界各国科学家研究的空白点。从1985年起，中国科学院所属的南海海洋研究所、北京大气研究所等6个单位，联合对西太平洋进行科学考察，先后布设了400多个观测点，获得了大批第一手的西太平洋海域大气研究资料，引起了世界上一些研究海洋和气候关系的科学家的关注。
