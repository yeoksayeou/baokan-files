Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, along with other leaders, met with representatives of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee chairpersons from various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. They emphasized the importance of strengthening ethnic unity and remaining vigilant against hostile forces attempting to disrupt it.

New China News Agency, Beijing, November 3 - (Reporters Cao Shaoping and Zheng Qingdong) CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin and CPC Central Committee Politburo Standing Committee member and Premier Li Peng today stressed that strengthening ethnic unity is a crucial aspect of our ethnic work. We must remain highly vigilant against domestic and foreign hostile forces that seek to exploit ethnic issues to split the country and disrupt ethnic unity. We must resolutely expose their plots.

Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Wan Li, Habib C. Alimjan, Apho Aqing Jinmei, Liao Hansheng, Fei Xiaotong, and Sima Yi Aimaidi and other leaders met this morning in the Great Hall of the People with all the representatives attending the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee chairpersons' conference from various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities.

Jiang Zemin said during the meeting that currently, our country's ethnic unity is excellent. However, from the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, we can see that some so-called "elites" who fled abroad have colluded with hostile forces promoting ethnic separatism. They aim to disrupt our country's ethnic unity and affect our nation's stability and unity. As long as our cadres from all ethnic groups seriously carry out ethnic unity work, their plots will not succeed.

Jiang Zemin hoped that the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committees at all levels and the broad cadre would unite the masses of all ethnic groups more broadly and achieve greater successes in ethnic work in the future.

Li Peng pointed out in his speech that China is a unified multi-ethnic socialist country. Ethnic unity is the guarantee of our country's prosperity and development and the fundamental guarantee for overcoming various difficulties at present. He said that in the 40 years since liberation, especially in the 10 years since the reform and opening up, our country's ethnic minorities have made significant achievements in politics, economy, culture, science, technology, education, and other fields. Our ethnic unity has entered a new historical period.

Li Peng emphasized that strengthening ethnic unity is one of the most important tasks in our ethnic work. He said that from the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, we have learned a profound lesson: some countries' hostile forces have not given up their attempts to subvert our socialist system. Their subversive methods are numerous, one of which is to disrupt ethnic unity. Although our current ethnic unity is good, we must not be complacent.

Li Peng pointed out that we should take various measures to guarantee the various rights that ethnic minorities, as members of our national family, should have, and gradually change the relatively backward situation in some ethnic regions in economic, educational, and cultural aspects. He said that the ethnic unity issue occupies an important position in the overall national construction. If handled well, it can maintain the country's stability and unity, ensure the prosperity and flourishing of all our ethnic groups, and ensure long-term stability. Yu Wen, Aisin-Gioro Puyi, Tao Aiying, Li Xuezhi, Li Gui, Pingcuo Wangjie, Cao Zhi, Zhang Shengzuo, and others participated in the meeting.

    江泽民李鹏会见各地人大民委主任会议代表时指出
    认真做好民族团结工作
    警惕敌对势力阴谋破坏
    新华社北京11月3日电  （记者曹绍平、郑庆东）中共中央总书记江泽民，中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理李鹏今天在这里指出，加强民族团结是我们民族工作的一项重要内容，对国内外敌对势力利用民族问题分裂祖国、破坏民族团结的企图，我们应当保持高度警惕，坚决予以揭露。
    江泽民、李鹏、万里、习仲勋、阿沛·阿旺晋美、廖汉生、费孝通、司马义·艾买提等领导同志今天上午在人民大会堂会见了参加全国省、自治区、直辖市人大民委主任会议的全体代表。
    江泽民在会见时说，目前我们国家的民族团结是很好的，但从最近在北京发生的动乱和反革命暴乱中也可以看出，跑到国外去的一部分所谓的“精英”，纠合一些搞民族分裂的敌对势力，企图破坏我国的民族的团结，影响我们国家的安定团结。只要我们的各族干部认真做好民族团结工作，他们的阴谋是不会得逞的。
    江泽民希望全国各级人大民委及广大干部更广泛地团结各民族群众，在今后的民族工作中作出更大的成绩。
    李鹏在讲话中指出，我国是一个统一的多民族的社会主义国家，民族团结是我们国家兴旺发达的保证，也是我们目前战胜各种困难的根本保证。他说，解放40年来，特别是改革开放10年来，我国各少数民族在政治、经济、文化、科技、教育等各个方面都取得了很大成就，我们的民族团结进入了新的历史时期。
    李鹏强调，加强民族团结是我们民族工作的一项最重要的任务。他说，从动乱和反革命暴乱中，我们得到了一个很深刻的教训，这就是某些国家的敌对势力对我们社会主义制度的颠覆之心不死，它们颠覆的手段很多，其中有一条就是破坏民族团结。虽然我们现在民族团结的状况很好，但我们也不能掉以轻心。
    李鹏指出，我们要采取多种措施，保障各少数民族作为我们民族大家庭中一员的各种应有的权利，在经济、教育、文化等各个方面逐步改变一些民族地区目前还相对比较落后的状况。他说，民族团结问题在整个国家的建设中占有重要的地位，只要处理得好，就能够保持国家的安定团结，保证我们所有的民族繁荣昌盛，长盛不衰。郁文、爱新觉罗·溥杰、陶爱英、李学智、李贵、平措汪杰、曹志、张声作等同志参加了会见。
