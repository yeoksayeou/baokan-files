On the morning of March 22, a group of employees and cadres from the paper mill in our county, led by the factory's deputy chairman of the trade union, suddenly stormed into the county's environmental protection supervision and monitoring office. They smashed office supplies and took away the sign and hanging plaque in front of the office. The cause of the incident was as follows:

On March 10, the county environmental protection office issued a notice to the county paper mill, demanding payment of 1,495 yuan in over-standard pollution fees for February. On March 14, the county construction and environmental protection bureau held a meeting on controlling pollution in Fengxiang County, attended by various polluting enterprises. Because the representatives from the county paper mill arrived late, the secretary and director of the environmental protection office conveyed the meeting's content and spirit to them and repeatedly urged them to pay the over-standard pollution fees for February on time. On the afternoon of March 21, the deputy director of the paper mill and two others came to the environmental protection office, arguing that the collection of pollution fees was unreasonable and amounted to arbitrary levies on enterprises. In the afternoon, the factory director also came to the environmental protection office and angrily said, "We have to report to you if we stop production? That's a big joke! I won't let this matter go!" The next day, the aforementioned incident of removing the environmental protection office sign and smashing office supplies occurred.

    纸厂不治理污染还摘环保所牌子
    三月二十二日上午，我县纸厂部分干部职工在厂长指使下，由厂工会副主席带领，突然闯进我县环境保护监理监测所，砸烂办公用品，抢走了门前的挂牌和吊牌。事情的起因是这样的：
    三月十日，县环保所按照规定，向县纸厂发出二月份一千四百九十五元超标排污费缴款通知书。三月十四日，县城建环保局召开了各污染企业参加的治理凤翔县污染会，因县纸厂来人较晚，环保所书记和所长向他传达了会议内容及精神，并一再叮嘱按时交纳二月份超标排污费。三月二十一日下午，县纸厂副厂长一行三人来到环保所，认为收排污费不合理，是向企业乱摊派。下午，这个厂的厂长又来到环保所大发雷霆，说：“我们停产要给你们环保所打报告？天大的笑话！我非把这事弄大不可！”第二天就发生了上述摘环保所牌子及砸办公用品的事件。
