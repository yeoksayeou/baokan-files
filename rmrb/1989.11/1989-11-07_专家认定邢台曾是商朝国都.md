Experts confirm that Xingtai was the capital of the Shang Dynasty. This is the conclusion reached at the recent national symposium on the history and culture of Xingtai.

Twenty-six experts and scholars who attended the symposium inspected the Cao Yan Zhuang Shang Dynasty cultural site and other historically significant relics of great archaeological value. They also engaged in in-depth academic exchanges. Based on a large number of Shang Dynasty cultural relics, pottery shards, oracle bone inscriptions, and records from the Jin Dynasty's "Bamboo Annals" such as "Zu Yi moved to Xingtai," the experts concluded that the Shang Dynasty had its capital in Xingtai for approximately 100 years. During the early and middle Shang periods, Xingtai had already developed to a considerable scale.

    专家认定邢台曾是商朝国都
    新华社石家庄11月6日电　邢台曾是商朝的国都。这是刚刚结束的全国邢台历史文化研讨会作出的结论。
    参加研讨会的26位专家学者考察了曹演庄殷商文化遗址等一些具有重要考古价值的历史遗迹，并进行了深入的学术交流。专家们从大量殷商文化遗址中发现的陶片、甲骨文记载、晋朝《竹书纪年》中“祖乙迁邢”等材料作出结论：商朝建都邢台约有100年左右。在早商、中商时期邢台已有相当规模的发展。
