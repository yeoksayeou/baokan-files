In the Ha-Da railway line that runs through the three northeastern provinces, there is a small town that has been repeatedly commended by the Ministry of Justice for its rule of law: Sanchahé Town in Fuyu City, Jilin Province. Over the past few years, the town's militia has taken the lead in legal education activities, learning and applying the law. Cai Cheng, the Minister of Justice, praised them as "pioneers of rule of law in towns."

One night, Chang Yongmin, a militia member from Daoxi Village, was tossing and turning in bed. His wife, Jiang Qingxia, woke up and asked, "What's wrong? Did you lose money?"

"No, it's not about losing money, but losing face," Chang replied.

In recent years, Chang Yongmin has been running a fruit stall in the market. Although it's hard work, he is happy. He often says, "The current policies of the Party are good. They have opened a path to prosperity for us. We must only do business in accordance with the law to repay the government." A few days ago, the municipal government held a civilized business awards ceremony, where Chang Yongmin was singled out for praise and named a "model of law-abiding and civilized business." However, he never expected that just after being praised, his wife would tarnish his reputation. It turned out that he had sent 250 tons of onions from the south, and since he couldn't rush back to Sanchahé Town, he asked his wife and mother to sell them at the market. When he returned from his trip, his wife told him that because the industrial and commercial tax officials hadn't collected the tax, they had saved 530 yuan.

Chang Yongmin was very uneasy about his wife's "saved" 530 yuan. He told his wife, "Making money is secondary to abiding by the law." His wife realized she had done wrong and said, "This isn't your fault. I'll go and pay the tax tomorrow." The next day, he and his wife went together to pay the tax to the tax collection department.

In the northwest of Sanchahé Town, in the third neighborhood committee of Xibei Street, live an elderly couple, Sun Jifu and his wife, both over seventy. One is blind, and the other is paralyzed. Their two sons and one daughter have all started their own families. The couple planned that after they pass away, they would divide their house and other property between the two sons. As for their daughter, according to the old custom, she would have no share in the property. This made the daughter unhappy. Female militia member Wang Guilan learned about this situation and felt that it was caused by the couple's lack of legal knowledge. If not resolved quickly, the family conflict would only escalate. Wang Guilan then, in the form of a casual chat, explained the basics of inheritance law to Sun Jifu and his wife, making them realize that their plan for dividing the property was illegal. They deeply felt, "We originally thought that a married daughter had no right to inherit her parents' property. Through learning, we only then understood that a married daughter also has the right to inherit." With Wang Guilan's help, the two elderly people revised their will, and the family conflict was resolved smoothly.

Farmer Liu Wanshan from the outskirts of the town signed a contract with professional household Wang Fa from Yushu County to sell 33,000 pounds of potatoes. According to the contract, Wang Fa was to pay Liu Wanshan upon receipt of the goods. However, after Liu Wanshan sent the potatoes to Wang Fa, he waited for more than half a year without seeing any payment. Several attempts to send people to collect the money were futile. Liu Wanshan gathered a few young farmers, planning to go and reason with Wang Fa, and if that didn't work, to seize Wang Fa's hand tractor to settle the debt. Just as the situation was about to escalate, militia company commander Jin Fucheng and town armed forces department director Zhao Zhonglin, who was on a work inspection, learned of the matter and rushed to the station. They explained to Liu Wanshan and the others the legal procedures for handling the matter and persuaded them to return. Later, through the timely mediation of the legal department, the dispute was resolved satisfactorily.

    依法治镇的带头人
    ——三岔河镇民兵学法用法的故事
    吴伯臣　霍延良
    在横穿东北三省的哈大铁路线上，有一个在依法治镇上受到司法部多次表彰的小镇——吉林省扶余市三岔河镇。几年来，镇上的民兵，在普法学习活动中带头学法用法，司法部部长蔡诚称赞他们是“依法治镇的带头人”。
    一天深夜，道西村民兵常永民躺在床上，辗转反侧。睡醒一觉的妻子蒋庆霞问道：“你咋还不睡，丢钱了吧？”“不是丢钱，而是丢人了。”
    这几年，常永民在市场上摆水果摊，虽然辛苦些，但他心里很高兴。他常说：“党的现行政策好，给我们开了一条致富的路，我们只有守法经商，才对得起政府。”前几天，市政府在全市文明经商表彰大会上，突出表扬了常永民，并把他树为
  “奉公守法、文明经商标兵”。可是，万没想到，刚受到表扬，却让妻子给抹了一把黑。原来，他从南方发回二百五十吨元葱，因他一时不能赶回三岔镇，便让妻子和老母亲去市场上卖。当他从外地回来时，妻子告诉他，因工商税务人员没找他收税，白捡了五百三十元。
    常永民为妻子“白捡”的五百三十元十分不安。他对妻子说，挣钱与守法相比，守法是第一位的。妻子认识到自己把事情做错了，愧疚地说：“这不关你的事，明天我去补交税款。”第二天，他和妻子一道，把税款送到收税部门。
    三岔镇西北街三委居民孙继富老俩口，都已年过古稀。一个双目失明，一个四肢瘫痪。两个儿子和一个闺女都已成家立业。老俩口打算，等他们过世后，就把房子和其它一些家产分给两个儿子。至于闺女嘛，按照老规矩，财产也就没她的份了。为此，女儿对老人有意见。女民兵王桂兰知道这一情况后，感到，这是因为孙老汉夫妇不懂法造成的，如不尽快解决，家庭矛盾就会越闹越大。王桂兰便以唠家常的形式，向孙继富夫妇宣传继承法的常识，使两位老人认识到自己对家产的分配计划是不合法的。他们深有感触地说：“我们原以为，嫁出去的闺女对父母的财产没有继承权。通过学习，才明白了出嫁的女儿也有继承权的道理。”在王桂兰的帮助下，两位老人重新修改了遗嘱，家庭矛盾得到妥善解决。
    镇郊菜农刘万山同榆树县专业户王发签订了出售三万三千斤土豆的合同。按合同规定，王发收到货就给刘万山汇款。但刘万山把土豆发给王发之后，等了半年多，也不见对方付款。几次派人去催，也无济于事。刘万山招集几名青年农民，准备去找王发讲理，如不行，就把王发的一台手扶拖拉机抢回来顶债。眼看事情就要闹大了，民兵连长金福臣和前来检查工作的镇武装部长赵仲林得知此事后，及时赶到车站，向刘万山等人讲明依法处理此事的办法和法律程序，把他们劝了回来。后经过法律部门的及时调解，纠纷得到了圆满解决。
