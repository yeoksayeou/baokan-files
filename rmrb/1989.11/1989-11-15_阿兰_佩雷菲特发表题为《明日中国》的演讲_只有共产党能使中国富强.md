Alain Peyrefitte, a member of the French Academy and a prominent French opposition figure, delivered a speech titled "Tomorrow's China" at the Brussels Parliament Building on the evening of the 13th. He reiterated his view that "the policy of sanctioning China is doomed to fail."

He analyzed that historically, economic sanctions against a country have never succeeded. Moreover, it is impossible to sanction a country with a population of one-quarter of the world, and it will only bring harm to one's own country.

In a speech that lasted over an hour, Peyrefitte started with a review of Chinese history to explain the differences between China's national conditions and those of Western countries. He believes that both now and in the future, the only party that can lead China to prosperity is the Communist Party of China.

The grand hall of the Parliament Building, which can accommodate over 1,000 people, was filled with audiences on both the lower and upper levels as well as on the podium. They were all ticket holders who were interested in the Chinese issue and came to listen to the speech. The price of a regular ticket was 300 Belgian francs (about $7). One audience member said, "The more people say bad things about China, the more it arouses people's interest in China."

    阿兰·佩雷菲特发表题为《明日中国》的演讲
    只有共产党能使中国富强
    本报布鲁塞尔11月14日电　记者魏崴报道：13日晚，法兰西学院院士、法国著名反对派人士阿兰·佩雷菲特于布鲁塞尔议会宫发表了题为《明日中国》的演讲，再度重申“制裁中国的政策注定要失败”的观点。
    他分析道，从历史上看，经济制裁某一国的政策从未成功过。况且，制裁一个人口占世界1／4的大国是不可能的事，反而倒会给自己国家带来不利。
    在长达一个多小时的讲演中，佩雷菲特从回顾中国历史出发，说明中国国情与西方国家的不同，他认为现在和今后，领导中国走向富强的，只有中国共产党。
    能容纳1000多人的议会宫大厅，楼下楼上及讲坛上坐满了听众。他们是关心中国问题购票聆听演讲的。普通票每张价为300比利时法郎（合7美元多）。一位听众说，越有人说中国不好，越激起人们对中国的兴趣。
