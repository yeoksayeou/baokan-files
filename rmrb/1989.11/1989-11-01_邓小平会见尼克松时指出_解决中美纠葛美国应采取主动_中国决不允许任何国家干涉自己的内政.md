		Deng Xiaoping Meets Nixon, Says U.S. Should Take Initiative to Resolve Sino-American Disputes
		China Will Not Allow Any Country to Interfere in Its Internal Affairs
		Beijing, October 31 (Xinhua) — Reporter Ding Gang: Chairman of the Central Military Commission Deng Xiaoping said during a meeting with former U.S. President Richard Nixon that we hope to resolve the disputes between China and the United States over the past few months as soon as possible and open up the future. On this issue, the United States should take the initiative and can only take the initiative.

		The meeting, which lasted about 90 minutes, was held this morning in the Fujian Hall of the Great Hall of the People. Mr. Nixon first said, "I have visited China many times and have always been warmly received. We are old friends." Chairman Deng said, "It is mainly because of what you have done that is worthy of welcome. Your visit to China in 1972 was wise and courageous, and it changed the long-term isolation between the two countries."

		Nixon said, "For 17 years, I have been paying close attention to U.S.-China relations. Currently, the two countries' relations are facing a serious test, and politicians from both countries should find ways to restore and continue the normal development of relations between the two countries."

		Deng told the guest that restoring and developing normal relations between the two countries is also our wish. Over the past decade, China has not done anything to harm the United States. However, to be frank, the United States has been too deeply involved in the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing. China is the real victim, and it is unfair to accuse China. Deng emphasized that we all care about our own countries and deal with issues based on national interests as the highest criterion. We will never forget national sovereignty, national dignity, and national pride.

		Deng pointed out that non-interference in internal affairs is crucial between countries, and China will never allow any country to interfere in its internal affairs.

		When talking about domestic issues, Chairman Deng emphasized that stability is paramount. In China, with so many people and such a weak foundation, without a stable and united living environment and a stable social order, nothing can be accomplished.

		The host and guest also exchanged in-depth views on some major international issues. Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and others attended the meeting. After the meeting, Chairman Deng hosted a banquet for Mr. Nixon.

    邓小平会见尼克松时指出
    解决中美纠葛美国应采取主动
    中国决不允许任何国家干涉自己的内政
    本报北京10月31日讯　记者丁刚报道：中共中央军委主席邓小平在会见美国前总统尼克松时说，我们希望尽快解决过去几个月来中美关系的纠葛，开辟未来。在这个问题上，美国应该采取主动，也只能由美国采取主动。同时，美国也是可以采取一些主动行动的。
    持续约90分钟的这次会见是今天上午在人民大会堂福建厅举行的。尼克松先生首先说，我来过中国多次，每次都受到欢迎，我们是老朋友了。邓小平主席说，“主要是你做的事情值得欢迎。你1972年的中国之行是明智的、勇敢的，它改变了中美两国长期隔离的状态。”
    尼克松说，17年来我一直关注美中关系，目前两国关系正面临着严重考验，两国的政治家应该想办法，使两国的正常关系得到恢复和继续发展。
    邓小平告诉客人，恢复和发展两国的正常关系也是我们的愿望。十几年来，中国没有做过任何一件伤害美国的事情。但是，坦率地讲，美国在不久前北京发生的动乱和反革命暴乱中陷得太深了。中国是真正的受害者，对中国进行指责是不公平的。邓小平强调说，我们都关心自己的国家，是以国家利益为最高准则来处理问题的。我们永远不能忘记国家的主权，不能忘记国格，不能丢掉民族自尊心。
    邓小平指出，国与国之间不干涉内政是至关重要的，中国绝不会允许任何国家干涉自己的内政。
    在谈到国内问题时，邓小平主席强调，稳定是压倒一切的。在中国，人这么多，底子这么薄，没有安定团结的生活环境，没有稳定的社会秩序，什么事也干不成。
    宾主还就一些重大国际问题深入地交换了看法。外交部长钱其琛等参加了会见。会见后，邓小平主席设宴招待了尼克松先生。
