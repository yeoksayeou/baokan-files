Recently, I came across a "divorce agreement" signed between a father-in-law and a son-in-law, which is quite thought-provoking. I am reproducing the entire document here:

Rong Meizhi and Zhao Qing Shan have decided to divorce due to irreconcilable differences. The divorce settlement is 800 yuan in cash, and all previous matters are settled. Since the couple has a son named Zhao Guohua, who is currently two years old and living with his mother, it is decided that Zhao Guohua's maternal uncle, Wang Qiangui, who is five years old, will be given to Zhao Qing Shan.

March 20, 1989 Divorce Agreement

After speaking with Zhao Qing Shan, I learned the full story behind this "divorce agreement."

In March 1986, Zhao Qing Shan, a young miner from the Jiangjiawan Coal Mine in Datong, Shanxi, was introduced to Wang Meizhi, a young woman from Yongshan Village, Fengzhen County, Inner Mongolia. They got married in October of the same year, and their marriage was initially harmonious. The following year, in July, they had a son named Zhao Guohua. Before the Spring Festival this year, Zhao's mother-in-law came to the mine, claiming that she wanted her daughter to live at home. Taking advantage of Zhao's absence at work, she took Wang Meizhi and the child away and never returned. Zhao Qing Shan became suspicious and went to Fengzhen, but he did not see his wife and child. He then demanded his father-in-law, Wang Changshun, to return his wife and child. The father-in-law arrogantly said, "My daughter has remarried. You take 800 yuan and we'll sign an agreement to settle this matter!" With no other choice, this young miner feared losing both his wife and the money, so he signed the aforementioned absurd "divorce agreement" with his father-in-law.

Reading this "divorce agreement" truly makes one laugh and cry at the same time, evoking deep emotions!

Firstly, divorce is a legal act that terminates a marriage. Divorce is a declaration of intent by the parties involved, and the subjects of divorce must be the husband and wife, not any third party. Obviously, as a "third party," the father-in-law is not a subject of divorce and cannot act on behalf of his daughter to express her intention to divorce. Therefore, the father-in-law has no right to exercise the power to divorce his daughter and son-in-law.

Secondly, divorce is a legal act that must go through legal procedures and be approved and confirmed by the law to take effect, not a matter of the parties' will. From this "divorce agreement," it is clear that the parties involved did not go through this legal procedure. This divorce agreement is illegal and therefore invalid.

Thirdly, if the female party, Wang Meizhi, has indeed registered to marry someone else, it constitutes the crime of bigamy. The male party, Zhao Qing Shan, should file a criminal lawsuit with the people's court in the place where the crime was committed, and pursue criminal liability in accordance with the law.

### 啼笑皆非的“退婚约”

　　啼笑皆非的“退婚约”
    最近，见到一份岳丈与女婿签订的“退婚约”，很引人思索，特全文照抄如下：
    王桂枝与赵青山感情不和决定退婚，退婚现金八百元整，以前一切一笔勾销。因双方结合已有一子名赵国华，现因孩子两岁随母带，决定将国华大舅5岁的王千贵送与赵青山。
    女方代理人：王长顺　男方：赵青山
    字据证明人：陈明亮　李福举李四后生　贺有娃　王罗罗　王千贵
    一九八九年三月二十日　退婚约
    经与当事人赵青山了解，才弄清了这份“退婚约”的来龙去脉。
      1986年3月，山西大同姜家湾煤矿青年矿工赵青山，经人介绍，与内蒙古丰镇县永善庄乡15号村女青年王桂枝相识，同年10月结婚，婚后夫妻感情尚好。次年7月，喜得娇子赵国华。今年春节前，赵的岳母来到矿上，以让女儿住娘家为名，乘赵上班不在家之机，将王桂枝和孩子带走，一去不返。赵青山心生疑窦，十下丰镇，也未见到妻、儿的面。于是，他向岳丈王长顺讨妻要儿。岳丈蛮横地说：“我女儿已另嫁他人，你拿上八百元钱，咱们订上个约拉倒算了！”无奈，这位青年矿工害怕人财两空，便与他岳丈签订了上述荒唐的“退婚约”。
    看了这份“退婚约”，真叫人啼笑皆非，感慨不已！
      第一，离婚是解除婚姻关系的法律行为。离婚是当事人的意思表示，离婚的主体必须是夫妻双方，而不能是任何第三人。显然，作为“第三人”的岳丈，不是离婚的主体，不能包办代替女儿作出是否离婚的意思表示。所以，岳丈根本无权行使女儿与女婿离婚的权利。
    第二，离婚是一种法律行为，必须经过法定程序，得到法律的批准和确认才发生效力，不是当事人的任意行为。从这份“退婚约”看，双方当事人显然并未经过这一法定程序。这份退婚约是违法的，当然也是无效的。
      第三，如女方王桂枝确与他人登记结婚，则构成了重婚罪。男方赵青山应向被告人犯罪地人民法院提起刑事诉讼，依法追究其刑事责任。
