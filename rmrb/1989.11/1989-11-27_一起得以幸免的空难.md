At 6:05 p.m. on November 23, a Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 747 jumbo jet, carrying 344 passengers and 17 crew members, took off from Islamabad International Airport bound for the Saudi capital, Riyadh.

The plane vanished into the night sky for about half an hour. A limping foreigner at the Islamabad airport taxi stand hailed a car, saying he wanted to go to the train station. As the car drove away from the parking lot, the passenger changed his mind, pulled out a note, and asked the driver to immediately hand it over to the airport security authorities, claiming that a time bomb had been planted on the recently departed plane. He then left the car. The driver quickly handed the note to a nearby on-duty police officer. Meanwhile, an anonymous caller phoned in, demanding $15 million to prevent the air disaster.

This crucial information quickly reached the Islamabad Airport Control Center. The person in charge immediately decided to notify the plane via the airport control tower's radio and order it to land at Karachi Airport for emergency handling. At that time, the plane had just left Pakistani airspace and entered the Arabian Sea. Upon receiving the notification, the pilot immediately decided to return and land at the nearest airport, Karachi. The passengers on board were still in the dark.

Karachi Airport was well-prepared. At 8:20 p.m. that night, as soon as the plane landed, fire trucks, ambulances, police cars, and security personnel surrounded the dangerous aircraft. Security personnel checked all passengers and luggage. More than 300 passengers who passed the check were accommodated in three hotels. After an all-night search, the police finally found a timed explosive device among more than 1,000 pieces of luggage. The device included two tubes of high-explosive weighing approximately 110 grams each, about 4 inches long, two 9-volt batteries, and a timer. Additionally, there was a lighter filled with gasoline and a box of matches, apparently intended to start a fire after the explosion. These items were packed in a plastic fast-food container, wrapped in a layer of cloth, and placed in a student's bookbag.

Security experts breathed a sigh of relief as a loose wire had caused the timer to stop working. According to the police, the explosive device was likely placed on the plane about an hour before takeoff, with the detonation time set for 7:20 p.m., when the plane would be flying over Pakistani airspace. However, the timing device had stopped working 20 minutes before takeoff. Otherwise, the year's deadliest air disaster would have occurred.

The police revealed that the bookbag had no luggage tag, and the security inspection equipment at Islamabad Airport could detect such explosive devices, so it was likely that the bomb was brought onto the plane through irregular channels. The explosive device was purely timer-activated, with no remote control. Some analysts speculated that the person carrying the bomb might not have stayed on the plane, or it could have been a suicide mission.

As of today, the Karachi police have detained 11 suspects, including Pakistanis and foreigners. The taxi driver who delivered the note at Islamabad Airport is also under protective custody, while the limping foreigner who rode in the car has vanished without a trace. The police are tight-lipped about the progress of the investigation, indicating that no significant leads have been found.

Passengers stranded in Karachi hotels have spent three restless nights. The jumbo Boeing 747 is still parked at Karachi Airport, with police adding special guards. The police's thorough investigation is still underway.

### 一起得以幸免的空难

　　一起得以幸免的空难
　　本报记者　任毓骏
    11月23日下午6时零5分，一架沙特阿拉伯航空公司的波音747巨型客机满载着344名乘客和17名机组人员从伊斯兰堡国际机场起飞直飞沙特首都利雅得。
    这架飞机消失在夜空约半个小时，一名跛腿外国人在伊斯兰堡机场出租车停车处要了一辆车，声称要到火车站。汽车刚驶离车场，这位乘客改变主意，掏出一张便条，让司机马上转交机场安全当局，说刚刚起飞的飞机上安装有一枚定时炸弹。说完便离车而去。汽车司机马上把条子交给附近值班的警察。与此同时，有人打来匿名电话，声称若当局交出1500万美元，可以防止这起空难事故。
    这一重要情报很快来到伊斯兰堡机场指挥中心，负责人马上决定通过机场控制塔的无线电通知这架客机并要求该机在卡拉奇机场降落进行紧急处理。这时，客机刚刚飞离巴基斯坦进入阿拉伯海上空。机长接到通知后，立即决定返航就近在卡拉奇降落。机上全体乘客还蒙在鼓中。
    卡拉奇机场早有准备。当晚8时20分飞机刚落地，消防车、救护车、警车和安全检查人员就把这架危险的客机团团围住。安全人员分头检查全体乘客和行李。通过检查的300多名乘客被安置在三个旅馆住下。经过彻夜检查，警方终于在1000多件行李中找出了一个定时爆炸装置。这一装置包括两管每管重约110克长约4英寸的烈性炸药，两节9伏的飞爆干电池和一个定时器。另外还有一枚装满汽油的打火机和一盒火柴，目的显然是在爆炸之后引发火灾。这些东西装在一个塑料快餐饭盒里，外面又裹了一层布，放在一个学生书包里。
    令安全专家们大松一口气的是，由于一条导线松开，定时器早已停止走动。据警方分析，这一爆炸装置大约在飞机起飞前一小时放进飞机，起爆时间拨在飞机起飞后1个多小时的晚7时20分，这时飞机正在巴基斯坦上空飞行。而定时装置早在飞机起飞前20分钟停止工作。否则，今年死亡人数最多的一起空难悲剧将发生。
    据警方透露，这个书包上没有行李签，而伊斯兰堡机场安全检查仪器也能测出这类爆炸装置，因而很可能这枚炸弹是通过非正常渠道带上机舱的。这一爆炸装置完全是靠定时计引爆，并没有遥控设备。有分析家推测说，携带炸弹的人很可能没有停留在机上，也有可能是一种自杀行为。
    到今天为止，卡拉奇警方已拘留了11名涉嫌携带炸弹的人，其中有巴基斯坦人，也有外国人。在伊斯兰堡机场传递便条的出租汽车司机也在警方的保护性拘留之中，而乘车的跛腿外国人则消失得无影无踪。警方闭口不谈调查的进程，显然是没有取得重要线索。
    滞留在卡拉奇旅馆的乘客已度过了三个不安宁的夜晚，巨型波音747还停留在卡拉奇机场，警方为这架飞机加了特别岗哨。警方的严密调查仍在紧张进行之中。
