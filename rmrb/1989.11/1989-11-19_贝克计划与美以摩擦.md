Israeli Prime Minister Shamir arrived in Washington on November 15 to hold talks with U.S. President Bush and Secretary of State Baker on the Middle East issue. This was the second high-level meeting between the U.S. and Israel this year, but the results showed that apart from expressing their respective views, the two sides did not reach a consensus on the issue of Middle East peace talks.

In general, the U.S. supports Israel on the Middle East issue, but there are also differences between the two sides, with the focus on the Baker Plan.

The "Baker Plan" is a proposal put forward by the U.S. to Israel and Egypt on October 10, aimed at promoting dialogue between the Palestinians and Israelis, and pushing the long-stalled Middle East peace process forward. The main content of the plan is to require the Palestinians and Israelis to hold talks in Cairo. The Palestinian representatives participating in the talks will be negotiated by Egypt with the Palestinians. If Israel agrees to the composition of the representatives, the talks will begin. The content of the talks will be based on Israel's proposed "election scheme." Although this plan has significant limitations and is clearly biased towards Israel, it has been met with numerous criticisms and obstructions from the Israeli right-wing Likud bloc, which has made the U.S. very frustrated.

On the surface, the U.S. and Israel's differences over the Baker Plan are focused on the agenda of the talks and the selection of Palestinian representatives, but the actual reasons are much deeper. According to analysts here, although both the U.S. and Israel do not support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, their views differ on how to deal with the PLO and achieve Middle East peace. Since this year, the U.S. and the PLO have begun dialogue and advocate that the Palestinians and Israelis ultimately resolve the Middle East issue through direct negotiations. Although the Baker Plan does not directly mention the PLO, the U.S. believes that the PLO can play an indirect role in the selection of representatives. Regarding the content of the talks, although the main discussion is about how to hold elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, it does not rule out the possibility of raising other related issues. However, the Israeli right-wing believes that the Baker Plan may pose a threat to Israel's position, leading to the recognition of the PLO, and ultimately ending the occupation. Therefore, they insist that the representatives of the talks can only be selected from the residents of the two occupied territories, the PLO cannot participate directly or indirectly, the talks are limited to discussing the details of the elections, and no other issues are discussed, and the U.S. must provide corresponding guarantees. The purpose of the Israeli right-wing's conditions is very clear, that is, to completely exclude the PLO from the negotiations, thereby delaying the comprehensive resolution of the Middle East issue.

Over the past year, the situation has shown that due to the U.S.'s repeated concessions to Israel's demands, the Israeli right-wing has become more arrogant. In April of this year, when Shamir first visited Washington, he was forced by the situation at the time to propose a so-called "election scheme" (i.e., holding elections by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to select representatives to negotiate with Israel for limited self-rule). This scheme eventually gained U.S. support. However, in the past half year, Israel's actual actions have shown that the Israeli right-wing has no intention of implementing its own "election scheme." It first added many restrictive conditions to the election scheme, making it a mere formality, and then rejected Egypt's 10-point peace plan to promote Palestinian-Israeli dialogue, effectively pushing the Middle East peace process into a dead end. Although the Baker Plan has once again made concessions to Israel, Israel is not satisfied and insists that the U.S. provide guarantees according to its conditions, otherwise it will not hold Palestinian-Israeli talks. It can be seen that although Israel verbally expresses "principled acceptance" of the Baker Plan, it is actually using a retreat as a tactic, and has not changed its original intention.

Regarding the current differences between the U.S. and Israel on the Middle East issue, observers here believe that the U.S. should not repeat the mistakes of the past, by continually indulging Israel or being satisfied with Israel's verbal expressions, but should more actively push Israel to change its stance. Otherwise, Israel will become even more arrogant, and the prospects for the Middle East peace process will become even more bleak.

    贝克计划与美以摩擦
    本报记者　张启昕
    以色列总理沙米尔11月15日来到华盛顿分别与美国总统布什和国务卿贝克就中东问题进行了会谈。这是美以之间今年举行的第二次高级会谈，但会谈的结果表明，双方除了表明各自的观点外，未在中东和谈问题上达成一致意见。
    在中东问题上，总的来说，美国是支持以色列的，但双方也有分歧，焦点集中在贝克计划上。
    “贝克计划”是今年10月10日美国向以色列和埃及提出的一项倡议，意在促成巴以对话，使长期陷于停顿的中东和平进程向前迈进一步。计划的主要内容是要求巴以在开罗举行对话，参加对话的巴勒斯坦代表由埃及同巴勒斯坦磋商，如果以色列同意人选的组成，则开始对话，对话的内容以以色列提出的
  “选举方案”作为基础。本来这一计划的局限性很大，对以色列的倾向性十分明显，但却遭到以色列右翼利库德集团的百般挑剔与抵制。这使美国感到很恼火。
    从表面上看，美以在贝克计划上的分歧是在对话的议程和参加对话的巴勒斯坦代表人选的问题上，但实际原因却要深远得多。据此间分析家认为，美以虽然都不赞成建立独立的巴勒斯坦国，但在对待巴解和实现中东和平上意见不同。今年以来，美国和巴解开始了对话，并主张以巴通过直接谈判，最终解决中东问题。这次贝克计划虽然未直接提到巴解，但美国认为在选择代表人选方面，巴解可以发挥某种间接作用。对于对话内容，虽然主要讨论如何在西岸和加沙地带实行选举，但也不排斥可以提出其他有关问题。然而以色列右翼却认为贝克计划可能构成对以色列立场的威胁，由此导致承认巴解，进而导致结束占领，因此坚持对话代表只能从被占领的两岸居民中选择，巴解不能直接或间接参与，对话只限于讨论选举细则，不谈任何其他问题，并要美国作出相应保证。以色列右翼提出这些条件的目的十分明显，就是要把巴解完全排斥在谈判之外，从而拖延中东问题的全面解决。
    近一年来的情况表明，由于美国对以色列的主张一让再让，以色列右翼得寸进尺，气焰更为嚣张。今年4月，当沙米尔第一次访问华盛顿时，迫于当时的形势，提出了一个解决阿以冲突的所谓“选举方案”（即由西岸和加沙地带的巴勒斯坦人举行选举，选出代表与以色列谈判，实行有限自治）。这个方案最终获得美国的支持。然而半年来以色列的实际行动表明，以色列右翼根本无意实施自己的“选举方案”，它先是给选举方案附加了许多限制条件，使之名存实亡，继而又拒绝埃及为推动巴以对话提出的10点和平计划，实际上把中东和平进程推进了死胡同。这次贝克计划虽然又一次向以色列作出了妥协，但以色列并不满足，一定要美国按照它提出的条件作出保证，否则就不进行以巴对话。由此可见，以色列虽然目前口头上表示“原则接受”贝克计划，实际上是以退为进，未变初衷。
    对于美以当前在中东问题上存在的分歧，此间观察家认为，美国不应重蹈前期覆辙，对以色列一味迁就或者满足于以色列的口头表示，而应更多地促使以色列改变立场，否则以色列还会更加得寸进尺，中东和平进程的前景将会更加渺茫。（本报华盛顿11月15日电）
