Wedding music festivals are gaining increasing attention and popularity in Shanghai. Following the successful inaugural "Wedding Music Festival" held by the Shanghai Orchestra during this year's Spring Festival, the orchestra recently organized another festival during the National Day holiday. Prior to the event, many newlyweds eagerly inquired about the details, booked tickets, and signed up to perform on stage. Fifteen couples purchased over six hundred tickets. The program began with a list of thirty newlyweds. Two elderly couples also took the stage to receive congratulations, celebrating their 42nd and 25th wedding anniversaries, respectively.

A groom from the Jinshan Petrochemical Complex expressed, "This format is better than the collective weddings of previous years. We are especially delighted that such an important event in our lives is being celebrated by the entire society." (October 13, *Wenhui Evening News*)

    高雅的婚礼音乐会
    婚礼音乐会正在上海市受到越来越多的关注和欢迎。上海乐团继今年春节首开“婚礼音乐会”后，最近又在国庆之际，再次为新婚夫妇举办音乐会。会前，许多新人纷纷上门问讯、订票、报名上台。十五对新人就买下六百余张音乐会票。打开大红节目单，首先是三十位新人的鸳鸯名录。有两对老人也上台接受大家祝贺，他们分别来纪念自己结婚四十二、二十五周年。
    来自金山石化总厂的一位新郎说：“这种形式比前几年的集体婚礼更好，我们为自己一生中如此重要的婚事能得到整个社会的祝贺而感到特别高兴。”　（十月十三日《新民晚报》）
