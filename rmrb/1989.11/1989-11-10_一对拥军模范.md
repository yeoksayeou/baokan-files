In Anhui Province's Bozhou City, people are praising the model deeds of Cai Shumin and her husband Xu Yangshan in supporting the military and caring for military families.

Cai Xu, a couple living on Chunhua Street, keep a record book detailing the work and living conditions, birthdays, and the addresses of their children's units for 56 military families and five-guarantee households on this street. This book was created by the couple to better support military families and assist the military in ideological education.

	•	Whenever a military family or five-guarantee household runs out of coal or needs to buy rice and flour, the couple always knows in advance and arranges for it to be delivered personally.

	•	Whenever a soldier misses home, Cai Shumin writes to them, reporting on the situation back home and encouraging them to serve diligently. In the past three years, she has been invited by the political departments and units of more than 280 soldiers from Bozhou to be a family education counselor, writing over a thousand letters.

	•	On the birthdays of the elderly, the couple always prepares gifts and visits them personally; when the elderly's clothes are dirty or torn, Cai Shumin washes and mends them promptly.

	•	Like a family daycare center, Cai Shumin, during her retirement, voluntarily took care of the children of six young military wives living on this street and the nearby two streets, thus relieving their worries.

The residents of Chunhua Street feel deeply from the couple's fervent love that serving in the military is glorious, and being a military family is even more glorious.

Cai Shumin and Xu Yangshan have raised four orphans together and have sent three sons to serve in the army, navy, and air force. The local people jokingly call them the "Three-Service Commanders."

In 1984, after returning from a meeting in Beijing, Xu Yangshan was still excited. He told his wife, "I want to personally make some shoe insoles and send them to the Old Mountain front line."

However, no one expected that the following spring, he fell ill—with fatal liver cancer.

For several months, he lay on his sickbed, and most of his conversations with his wife were about shoe insoles.

Before his death, he had not eaten or drunk for several days, and his mouth was covered with transparent blisters. He held his wife's hand, his voice weak and intermittent, repeatedly saying, "...We must live up to the glorious title, not disappoint the Party's care, the shoe insoles must be sent..." Cai Shumin nodded tearfully.

On December 20, 1985, the merciless disease took Xu Yangshan's life at the age of just fifty.

After settling her husband's affairs, Cai Shumin, despite the pain of losing a loved one, fulfilled her husband's wish. She took out the fabric her husband had prepared and the mourning banners people had sent, and matched them with her son's military shoes, cutting them into four sizes.

Those days, she dragged her weak body, braved the icy cold, got up early and stayed up late, stitching and weaving one needle and one thread at a time. Nearby young students and elderly people near the age of sixty were also moved to come and help.

Just one month after Old Xu's passing, exactly 300 pairs of shoe insoles were made. Cai Shumin then specially went to the "Mulan Store" in the bustling market area to buy 10 packs of Bozhou cigarettes and 10 pounds of crispy candy to send along with them, fulfilling her husband's last wish.

    一对拥军模范
    景凤启　张永敏
    在安徽省亳州市，人们传颂着蔡淑敏和他的丈夫徐杨善拥军优属的模范事迹。
    居住在纯化街的徐蔡夫妇，家中有一本记载着这条街56户军烈属、五保户的工作、生活情况、诞生日及他们子女所在部队的地址的花名册，这是夫妇俩为做好优属工作，配合部队搞好思想教育建立的。
    ——平时哪位军属、五保户的煤快烧完了，米面该买了，两口子都心中有数，总是提前安排，亲自送上门。
    ——谁的孩子想家了，蔡淑敏都及时写信报告家乡的情况，勉励其安心服役。近三年来，她先后被亳州籍的280多名战士所在部队的政治机关、连队聘请为家庭教育辅导员，写信千余封。
    ——哪位老人生日到了，夫妇俩总是备上礼物亲自登门祝贺；老人的衣服脏了破了，蔡淑敏都及时替他们洗好补好。
    ——像是家庭幼儿园，蔡淑敏在退休几年间，先后为居住在本街道及附近两个街道的6名年轻军人妻子义务当起了保育员，从而解除了她们的后顾之忧。
    纯化街的居民们从徐杨善夫妇炽热的深情中，深深感到参军光荣，当军属更光荣。
    蔡淑敏和徐杨善一共抚养了4个孤儿，还陆续送3个儿子到陆海空军服役，当地群众都风趣地称他们“三军司令”。
    1984年，徐杨善上北京开会回来，仍激动不已。他对妻子说：要亲自做些鞋垫，寄到老山前线去。
    然而谁也没有想到，第二年的春天，他病倒了——致命的肝癌。
    一连几个月，他躺在病榻上，同妻子的话题也大多是鞋垫。
    临终前，他已好几天不吃不喝，嘴上起满了透明的水泡。他拉住妻子，声音微弱，断断续续重复着：“……要对得起光荣称号，不辜负党的关怀，鞋垫一定要寄去……”蔡淑敏含泪点了点头。
    1985年12月20日，无情的病魔夺去了徐杨善年仅半百的生命……
    料理完丈夫的后事，强忍着失去亲人的痛苦，蔡淑敏在实现着丈夫的嘱咐。她把丈夫生前备的布料和人们送的挽帐搬了出来，对照儿子的军用鞋，剪成四种型号。
    那些日子，她拖着虚弱的病体，顶着结冰的严寒，早起晚睡，一针针、一线线地缝织着。邻近的青年学生和年近花甲的老人，也感动得前来帮忙。
    仅在老徐去逝后的一个月，整整300双鞋垫做成了。蔡淑敏又特意来到地处闹市区的“木兰商店”买了10条亳州烟和10斤酥糖一同寄了出去，实现了丈夫的遗愿。
