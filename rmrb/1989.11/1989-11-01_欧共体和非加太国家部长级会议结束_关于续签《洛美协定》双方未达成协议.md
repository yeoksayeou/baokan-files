Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, October 30th.

The ministerial-level meeting between the European Community and 66 countries from Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific region regarding the renewal of the Lomé Convention concluded today without reaching an agreement.

The main obstacle in the talks was the internal disagreement within the European Community over the amount of financial aid to be provided to the ACP countries. The United Kingdom proposed that the European Community should provide approximately 8.8 billion European Currency Units (ECU) in financial aid to the ACP countries in the next Lomé Convention, while France advocated for increasing the aid amount to over 12 billion ECU. Representatives from the ACP countries suggested that, considering the economic challenges these countries face, such as slow growth, debt, inflation, falling prices of primary commodities, and economic adjustments, the European Community should increase the financial aid to 15.5 billion ECU.

In terms of trade, the ministers from the European Community firmly opposed the ACP countries' proposal to allow a series of agricultural products to enter the European market freely.

Both sides agreed to continue negotiations on the aforementioned issues in the near future.

The chairman of this ministerial-level meeting, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, told the press that negotiations had made substantial progress on many important issues. He expressed confidence that the differences between the two sides could be resolved before the end of December to sign a new agreement.

    欧共体和非加太国家部长级会议结束
    关于续签《洛美协定》双方未达成协议
    新华社布鲁塞尔10月30日电　（记者杨元华）欧洲共同体和非洲、加勒比及太平洋地区66国关于续签《洛美协定》的部长级会议今天结束，双方未达成协议。
    会谈的主要障碍是欧共体内部在向非加太国家提供多少财政援助的问题上有分歧。英国主张欧共体在下一个《洛美协定》中向非加太国家提供大约88亿欧洲货币单位的财政援助，法国则主张把援助的数额提高到120亿欧洲货币单位以上。非加太国家的代表提出，考虑到这些国家面临的经济低速增长、债务、通货膨胀、初级产品价格下降和经济调整等问题，欧共体提供的财政援助数额应提高到155亿欧洲货币单位。
    在贸易方面，欧共体的部长们坚决反对非加太国家代表提出的，让一系列农产品自由进入欧洲市场的建议。
    会谈双方同意在不久的将来继续就上述问题举行谈判。
    本届部长级会议主席、法国外长迪马对新闻界说，谈判已经在许多重要问题上取得实质性进展。他表示对在12月底续签新协定以前解决双方存在的分歧抱有信心。
