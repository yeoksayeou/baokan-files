The U.S. Space Shuttle Discovery, which had been in flight for five days, safely landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California on the afternoon of the 27th. The Discovery was originally scheduled to return on the evening of the 26th, but due to strong crosswinds at the landing site, the landing time was postponed twice.

On the 23rd, the Discovery placed a military spy satellite weighing 2.5 tons and valued at $300 million into space. The satellite is used to monitor military deployments and electronic communications in the Soviet Union, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.

　　美发现号航天飞机返回地面
    飞行五天的美国“发现”号航天飞机二十七日下午在加利福尼亚州爱德华兹空军基地安全降落。“发现”号原计划二十六日晚间返回地面，由于降落地点侧风过强，降落时间曾两次推迟。
    “发现”号于二十三日在太空放置了一枚重二点五吨、价值三亿美元的军事间谍卫星，用于监测苏联、欧洲、非洲及中东地区的军事部署和电子通讯。
