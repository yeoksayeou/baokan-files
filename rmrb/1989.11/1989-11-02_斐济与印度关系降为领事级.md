Fiji Downgrades Relations with India to Consular Level

	BEIJING, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- Fiji, a Pacific island nation, announced on Oct. 31 that it would downgrade its diplomatic relations with India from ambassadorial to consular level and ordered the Indian ambassador, T. Sreenivasan, to leave the country within three days.

	The announcement accused the Indian government of interfering in Fiji's internal affairs and stated that Sreenivasan's "actions and words over the past two years have drawn the attention and displeasure of the Fiji government," and that he had "involved himself in politically sensitive issues."

	Reports indicated that Sreenivasan, during a recent gathering, linked the recent attacks on Hindu temples in Fiji with the interim government's formal proposal of a constitutional draft that ensures political supremacy for indigenous Fijians over other minority groups.

	An Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman in New Delhi said that day that Fiji's decision to expel the ambassador after India's decision to recall its ambassador on Oct. 28 was "unnecessary." He believed that Fiji's actions would only further strain the relationship between the two countries.

	Since the constitutional draft, which includes the aforementioned content, was formally proposed in September, it has immediately faced criticism from local Hindus and cultural organizations. Following this, from October onwards, several cities in Fiji have seen Hindu temples repeatedly attacked by indigenous Fijians. The situation in Fiji has drawn the attention of the Indian government.

    斐济与印度关系降为领事级
    新华社北京11月1日电  综合堪培拉、新德里消息：太平洋岛国斐济10月31日发表声明决定把斐济和印度的外交关系从大使级降为领事级，并限令印度驻斐济大使特·斯雷尼瓦桑在3天之内离开斐济。
    声明指责印度政府干涉斐济的内政，并称斯雷尼瓦桑“在过去2年中的言行引起了斐济政府的关注和不悦”，“卷入了政治敏感问题”。
    有报道说，斯雷尼瓦桑在不久前举行的一次集会上，把最近斐济出现的袭击印度教寺庙的事件与斐济临时政府正式提出一项确保土著斐济人享有高于其他少数民族的政治权力的宪法草案一事联系起来。
    印度外交部发言人当天在新德里说，斐济政府在印度10月28日决定召回其大使后，再宣布驱逐大使是“没有必要的”。他认为，斐济政府采取这一行动只会使两国关系更趋冷淡。
    今年9月包括上述内容的宪法草案正式提出后，立即受到当地印度教徒和文化组织的批评，紧接着从10月份以来，斐济一些城市出现了印度教寺庙连续遭到土著斐济人的袭击的事件。斐济局势已引起印度政府的注意。
