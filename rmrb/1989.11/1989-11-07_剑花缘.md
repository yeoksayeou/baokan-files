The sword flower and I were once closely connected.

Back then, my family lived in a small lane near the eastern outskirts of an ancient town. Behind our house was the backyard garden of a wealthy person, and behind the garden stood the pawnshop building. I have no idea about the rise and fall of the pawnshop, but I remember that shortly after liberation, its owner fled to a foreign country, and the garden became quiet ever since. We often admired the white jasmine, bird of paradise, and eggplant flowers through our back window. The delicate flower trees gradually withered, and the several large clusters of sword flowers on our street wall became particularly eye-catching. It was not afraid of drought and barrenness, growing roots, branches, and spreading along the wall. Every May, hundreds of yellowish-white sword flowers would bloom on those thick, fleshy green stems, releasing a fragrant scent. We bent a small hook with iron wire at the top of a stick and competed to hook the sword flowers. Then we cut the flowers into four small petals, dried them, steamed them, dried them again, and sealed them in a jar for about ten days. During festivals, celebrations, or when friends and relatives visited, it was an excellent ingredient for pork rib soup, and it was also a great gift to give.

As the years passed, I left the flower-picking team and only found the distant childhood joy in the "celebration" of the children shouting, calling, and laughing. Unfortunately, this nostalgia was blown away by a tornado. After the wind passed, the wall collapsed, and among the scattered bricks, there were piles of sword flower stems struggling to survive. After the wall was repaired, the sword flower clusters were gone from the top, and the children were quiet for several days. One day, the children gathered again on the street to play. Someone shouted: "Come and see, the sword flowers are blooming!" I went out to look, and on the high wall of the pawnshop building, there were about two to three meters of sword flower stems in a zigzag pattern, with two egg-yellow sword flowers blooming on top, looking like a colorful relief sculpture.

The sword flower is also known as the "over-the-river dragon" and the "tyrant flower." I think the character "sword" is easy to understand, as its stem is dark green, with three sharp points like an ancient bronze sword. The "tyrant" refers to its spirit. This unyielding and daring-to-excel spirit is a bit "tyrannical," isn't it?

Later, I moved to a new residence. In front was a bustling avenue, and on both sides were tall buildings, with no trace of the old residence's urban-rural junction. Although I rarely had the chance to see sword flowers, they often lingered in my mind and were hard to forget. On a Sunday morning after a rainy night, the weather was particularly good. I was pruning flowers on the south-facing balcony when I suddenly heard children's laughter and applause from downstairs. A boy was receiving a vibrant sword flower, and his father was leaning on a wooden ladder against the wall, handing down sword flowers one by one to his son. Later, I found out that before the high-rise buildings were built, many walls were planted with sword flowers. During the construction, they were destroyed, leaving only a short section of mud wall shared by three units, accompanied by a particularly lush sword flower. I took care of the flowers after work, often looking at the remaining wall from the balcony railing, hoping to see the sword flowers from early summer to late autumn.

Once, I visited the town of Shui in Nanhai County and learned that the sword flower had another very modern-sounding name—"wealth flower." Nanhai County is one of the richest in Guangdong, and each village and town has its own path to economic development. Shoe and hat manufacturing industries have long been famous, and growing sword flowers has also become a fashionable business for farmers. Sword flowers are not only loved by locals but also by Hong Kong, Macau, Southeast Asia, and even overseas Chinese communities around the world, who consider sword flowers an excellent ingredient for soup. Since foreign trade became active, the export volume of sword flowers has been increasing. The farmers in Li Shui Town planted sword flowers in large quantities, earning foreign exchange for the country and continuously improving their family income. Along the roads, on the hills, and even in the corners of houses, there were piles of new bricks built into short sections of walls about half a meter high, on which sword flowers were planted. The red brick walls, green stems, and dotted egg-yellow flowers looked like flying fire dragons from afar and like stars falling in the fields up close. He Shui Village is one of the main sword flower production areas in Li Shui Town. There, I met an old man who was picking flowers. Perhaps because of the past joy of picking sword flowers, I couldn't help but join him in picking. The old man told me that their village had been growing sword flowers for over a hundred years. In the past, they were mostly planted on the walls in front of and behind the houses, growing wild. Since the foreign trade department started purchasing in large quantities, it has become the villagers' main source of income. The old man also said that the sword flowers of the past were coarse and long, requiring no management, and could still bloom many flowers; now, with careful management, more nutrients, and more flowers blooming each year, the flowers are bigger each year. Due to sufficient wind and heat, and reasonable fertilization, his flower wall once bloomed nine times in a year.

    剑花缘
    郑启谦
    剑花与我一度颇为密切。
    那时候，我家就在这座古镇接近东郊的一条横街上，屋后紧挨着一位阔人的后花园，花园后面是当铺楼。当铺楼的盛衰我不得而知，只记得解放初，它的主人跑到外国去了，此后花园一片静寂。我们常常透过后窗观赏园中的白兰花、鹰爪花、鸡蛋花……娇嫩的花树逐渐凋零了，我们临街墙上那几大丛剑花格外引人注目。它不怕干旱贫瘠，依傍墙头生根、分枝、繁衍。每年五月开始，那些肉质甚厚的绿茎上便绽开数以百计的黄里透白的剑花，散发出阵阵芬芳。我们用铁线弯一个小钩套在竿顶，争着勾剑花。然后把花切成四小瓣，晒干，蒸熟，再晒干，放入罐内密封十来天。每当节日喜庆或亲朋来访，是煲猪肉汤的上好材料，送人也是上佳礼品。
    随着年岁增大，我退出了摘花队伍，只从小儿郎嚷着叫着笑着的“庆典”中寻觅远去的童趣。不幸这种怀旧情绪竟被龙卷风刮走了。风过处，围墙倒塌，满地残砖中夹杂着一堆堆剑花绿茎，正在挣扎。围墙修复之后，墙头已没了剑花丛，小孩子为此沉静了好几天。有一天，孩子们又聚在街头玩耍，是谁惊叫了一声：快来看呀，开剑花啦！我出去一看，在当铺楼的高墙上，攀附着大约两三米之字形的剑花茎，上面盛开着两朵蛋黄色的剑花，活像一幅彩色的浮雕。
    剑花又叫过江龙，别号霸王花。我想，“剑”字好理解，因其茎墨绿，三梭起菱如古铜长剑，这是形似。霸王则指其神韵。这种不屈不挠敢于出人头地的气势，不是有点“霸”么？！
    后来我乔迁新居。前面是繁华的大道，两旁是高耸的楼房，全没了旧居城乡接壤的痕迹。尽管已很少有机会看到剑花了，时时萦绕心际，无法忘怀。一个雨夜后的星期天早晨，天色特别好，我正在南阳台修剪花草，楼下突然传来小孩的欢笑声和掌声。一个男孩正接过一朵鲜丽的剑花，他父亲倚在墙头的木梯上，把一朵朵剑花摘下递给儿子。后来才知道，这一带未改建高楼时，许多围墙栽满了剑花，基建时给毁了，只留下一截三个单位共有的泥墙，伴着一丛格外茁壮的剑花。我下班侍弄花事，在阳台栏板前不时瞧瞧那残墙盼剑花，从初夏一直到深秋。
    有一次赴南海县里水镇访问，知道剑花还有一个十分富有时代气息的名字——致富花。南海县属广东首富，各个村镇经济发展都有各自的门路，制鞋制帽等工业早已名扬四方，养种剑花也成了农民时尚的事业。剑花不但本地人爱吃，港澳及东南亚，甚至世界各地的华人区，都视剑花为煲汤上料。自从外贸活跃后，剑花出口量日增。里水镇农民大量种植，出口创汇，为国家创造了大笔财富，也不断提高了家庭收入。在公路旁，山岗上，甚至家宅庭院的五边地，都堆满了新砖砌成一小段一小段的、只有米半左右高的砖墙，上面栽着剑花。红砖墙，绿花茎，衬着点点蛋黄色，远看如火龙飞舞，近看似星落田野。河村是里水镇剑花主要产地之一，在那里，我遇到一位正在摘花的老伯。兴许是往日有过摘剑花的乐趣，情不自禁地跟他一块采摘。老伯告诉我，他们村种养剑花已有百多年历史，以前大都栽种在屋前屋后的墙头，自生自长。自从外贸部门大量收购，便成了村民们主要经济来源。老伯还说，往日的剑花，粗生粗长，不用管理，已经能开出许多花来；如今得到精心管理，养份多了，结的花一年比一年多，一年比一年大。由于风热足，施肥合理，他的一道花墙，有一年竟开了九次。……
