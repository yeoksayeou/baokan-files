In recent years, various levels of government have organized urban residents and workers to build their own houses, which has become an effective way to alleviate the housing shortage in urban areas. In 1988, a total of 470,000 urban households and workers built residential houses, with a total investment of 6.699 billion yuan, and a total construction area of 40.35 million square meters. Among them, Guangdong Province had the largest construction area for urban residents' self-built houses in that year, reaching 5 million square meters.
