Japanese Professor Proves Traditional Chinese Medicine Effective for Alzheimer's Disease

   The traditional Chinese medicine "Angelica Sinensis and Peony Powder" has been proven effective in treating Alzheimer's disease, according to recent animal experiments conducted by Professor Michihiro Fujihara of the School of Pharmacy at Fukuoka University in Japan.

   "Angelica Sinensis and Peony Powder" is composed of six natural herbs and is commonly used to treat menopausal disorders and infertility.

   Fujihara's experiments showed that mice with dementia that were administered "Angelica Sinensis and Peony Powder" exhibited significantly more sensitive reactions compared to those that did not receive the medication. Fujihara plans to conduct further pharmacological research on "Angelica Sinensis and Peony Powder" and intends to use it as a preventive medication for Alzheimer's disease in clinical applications.

    当归芍药散能治痴呆症
    新华社东京11月4日电　日本福冈大学药学系藤原道弘教授最近通过动物实验证实，中药“当归芍药散”对治疗阿耳茨海默氏型痴呆症有效。
    “当归芍药散”是由六种天然草药构成。它一般广泛用于治疗更年期障碍、不孕症等生殖机能方面的疾病。
    藤原教授所进行的实验表明，服用“当归芍药散”的痴呆老鼠比没有服用这种药的痴呆老鼠的反应明显灵敏。藤原教授打算对“当归芍药散”药理作进一步的研究，并把它作为阿耳茨海默氏型痴呆症的预防药应用于临床。
