The General Staff Department, General Political Department, and General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army jointly issued a notice today, requiring the entire army to participate in national economic construction with greater enthusiasm.

The notice from the three departments states that participating in national socialist economic construction is a fine tradition of our army and a concrete embodiment of the purpose of the people's army. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee has made the decision to further improve the rectification and deepen the reform. Under this situation, actively and proactively supporting national economic construction, working together with the people of the entire country, and overcoming the difficulties currently faced is a practical action for the army to share the nation's burdens and support the national rectification. It is also a responsibility that our army cannot shirk. With the approval of the Central Military Commission, starting from 1990, the entire army's average annual mandatory participation in national economic construction labor time shall not be less than 10 days. Specifically, brigade-level and below combat units and school students shall average 10 to 15 days, scientific research and technical units shall average 7 to 10 days, and division-level and above headquarters shall average 7 days. The required time shall be uniformly arranged in the annual work plan, and time spent on disaster relief can also be counted towards the mandatory labor time.

The notice requires that all levels of party committees and organs strengthen leadership over this work, arrange and organize it in a comprehensive manner according to the conditions of the troops and the actual situation of the station, focus on effectiveness, and ensure implementation. Efforts should be made to participate more in agricultural infrastructure construction and actively support agricultural development. During the process of participating in mandatory labor, the troops should be educated to learn from the masses, abide by discipline, and further enhance military-civilian unity.

    解放军三总部联合发出通知要求
    全军以更大热情参加经济建设
    明年起每人年均义务劳动不少于十天
    新华社北京11月10日电　解放军总参谋部、总政治部、总后勤部今天联合发出通知，要求全军以更大的热情义务参加国家经济建设。
    三总部的通知说，参加国家社会主义经济建设，是我军的优良传统，是人民军队宗旨的具体体现。党的十三届五中全会作出了进一步搞好治理整顿和深化改革的决策。在这种形势下，积极主动地支援国家经济建设，与全国人民一道，艰苦奋斗，克服当前面临的困难，是军队为国家分忧，支持国家治理整顿的一项实际行动，是我军义不容辞的责任。经中央军委同意，从1990年起，全军每人每年义务参加国家经济建设的劳动时间平均不得少于10天，其中团以下作战部队和院校学员人均10至15天，科研、技术单位人均7至10天，师以上机关人均7天。所需时间在年度工作计划中统一安排，参加抢险救灾的时间也可算在义务劳动时间之内。
    通知要求各级党委和机关要加强对这项工作的领导，根据部队自身的条件和驻地的实际情况，统筹安排，严密组织，注重实效，保证落实。要尽可能地多参加一些农业基础建设，积极支援农业的发展。在参加义务劳动过程中，要教育部队向人民群众学习，遵守群众纪律，进一步增进军政军民团结。
