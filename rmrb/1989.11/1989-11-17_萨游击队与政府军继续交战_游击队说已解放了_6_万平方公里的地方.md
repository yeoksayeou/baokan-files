    Guerrillas and Government Forces Continue Fighting in El Salvador
    Guerrillas Claim to Have Liberated 60,000 Square Kilometers

    Our reporter Guo Weicheng reports from San Salvador, El Salvador, November 14th: Today in San Salvador, dawn arrived with the sound of gunfire. At 6 AM, intense gunshots shattered the night's silence; the northern battle zone resumed firing.

    The reporter was trapped in a northern part of the city due to the curfew and observed from outdoors until dawn. Only in the early night, did he see more than 10 government military armored vehicles heading towards the southwest of the capital. Before that, gunshots had unexpectedly erupted in that area. The U.S. Embassy and the U.S. Ambassador's residence are both located in that district. At 6 AM, as the sky began to lighten, the gunfire intensified, signaling the start of the battle. In the morning, the government military began forcibly evacuating residents in the northern part of the city and started bombing the areas controlled by the guerrillas. The authorities have not officially announced the details of the conflict, repeatedly emphasizing that "the situation is under control."

    Meanwhile, the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (the guerrillas) issued a statement today, ordering all guerrilla units to continue defending the occupied positions and to "organize a general uprising of the people." The statement declared that the areas controlled by the guerrillas across the country are "liberated zones" and that the people will establish people's governments in the aforementioned liberated cities and towns.

    The guerrilla radio station broadcast today that the guerrillas have liberated an area of 60,000 square kilometers in 8 out of the 14 provinces nationwide.

    The largest trade union organization, the National Labor Union, called for a nationwide general strike today.

    萨游击队与政府军继续交战
    游击队说已解放了6万平方公里的地方
    本报圣萨尔瓦多（萨尔瓦多）11月14日电　记者郭伟成报道：圣萨尔瓦多今天的黎明与激战同时来到。早晨6时，激烈的枪声震醒了一夜的沉寂；城北战区重新开火。
    记者因宵禁被困城北某处，至黎明时分，一直在户外观察，只是在上半夜，看到10余辆政府军的装甲车编队开往首都西南方。在这以前，那一带也曾意外地响起枪声。美国大使馆及美国大使官邸均在那一区。早上6时，东方透白，枪声大作，宣告战斗开始。上午，政府军开始在城北一带强制疏散居民，并开始对游击队占领区实施轰炸。当局仍然没有正式宣布战事细节，只一再强调“局势已经得到控制”。
    与此同时，法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线（游击队）总指挥部今天发表公告，命令游击队各部队，继续固守已经占领的各处阵地，进而“组织全体人民的起义”；宣布游击队在全国各地的控制区域为“解放区”，并称人民将在上述解放区城镇建立人民政府。
    游击队的电台今天广播说，游击队已解放全国14省中8个省的6万平方公里面积。
    最大的工会组织全国劳工联盟今天号召进行全国总罢工。
