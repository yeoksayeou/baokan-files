Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 21st.

On the morning of November 16th, the Hubei Provincial Government Office telephoned the Yichang Prefectural Government, informing them that after Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji received Premier Li Peng's instructions to help Shanghai sell Yichang's citrus fruits, he immediately directed relevant departments to assist the Yichang region in selling citrus fruits in Shanghai, and to provide as much convenience as possible in terms of transportation and storage.

This year, the Yichang region had an exceptionally bountiful harvest of citrus fruits, with a total production of 135 million kilograms, but faced difficulties in selling them. Premier Li Peng was very concerned upon learning of this situation.

After receiving the provincial government's telephone call, Deputy Prefectural Governor Liu Mutian and Secretary-General Li Guopu immediately convened a meeting with the heads of the Financial Office and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative to discuss the issue of selling citrus fruits, and decided to immediately dispatch personnel to Shanghai to prepare for the procurement and transportation of citrus fruits.

That afternoon at 5 PM, the regional Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the regional Fruit Company sent four people along with the provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative's responsible person to fly to Shanghai.
