Xinhua News Agency, Windhoek, November 15th.

The final results of the Namibian Constituent Assembly elections were officially announced on the evening of the 14th. The South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) secured 384,567 out of a total of 670,830 valid votes and won 41 out of the 72 seats in the parliament. SWAPO's main rival, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, secured 21 seats, the United Democratic Front secured 4 seats, and the remaining seats were won by smaller parties.

The results were announced separately by the Chief Electoral Officer, Wisser, and the spokesperson for the South African Administrator's Office in Namibia, Raux.

Earlier, the United Nations Special Representative for Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, confirmed the election results and held a press conference, stating that the five-day election process was "free and fair."

After the announcement of the election results, SWAPO Chairman Sam Nujoma and the leaders of other parties that secured seats each spoke on television, expressing their acceptance of the election results and their desire for national reconciliation and the joint construction of an independent and prosperous new nation.

The newly elected Namibian Constituent Assembly will hold its first meeting next week. The assembly will also draft the first constitution for independent Namibia and determine the date of the country's independence.

Namibia is the last remaining African country awaiting independence. SWAPO is the largest nationalist party in Namibia and enjoys the support of the Ovambo people, who make up approximately 50% of the country's population. The current chairman is Sam Nujoma. The organization was established on April 19, 1960, originally known as the Ovambo People's Organization, which was later changed to the South West Africa People's Organization.

On August 26, 1966, SWAPO's armed forces launched an attack on South African colonial troops in the Caprivi region, marking the beginning of the armed struggle. In 1973, the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity recognized SWAPO as the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people.

For a long time, SWAPO has been engaged in an unyielding struggle against the South African authorities' illegal occupation and colonial rule of Namibia.

    西南非洲人民组织
    在议会选举中获多数席位
    赢得议会72个席位的41席
    新华社温得和克11月15日电　（记者熊仲琪）纳米比亚制宪议会选举的最后结果14日晚正式宣布，西南非洲人民组织获得了全部670830张有效选票中的384567票，并赢得了议会72个席位中的41席。西南非人组的主要竞争对手特恩哈尔民主联盟获得了21个议席，联合民主阵线获得4席，其他席位为一些小党所得。
    这一结果是由负责纳米比亚选举的首席选举官维瑟和南非驻纳米比亚行政长官办公室发言人劳克斯在14日晚分别宣布的。
    在此以前，联合国驻纳米比亚特别代表阿赫蒂萨里对选举结果进行了确认，并举行记者招待会说，这次进行了5天的选举是“自由的和公正的”。
    选举结果宣布后，西南非人组主席努乔马和其他获得席位的政党的领袖分别在电视台发表讲话，表示接受选举结果，并表达各党派实现民族和解，共同建设独立繁荣的新国家的愿望。
    纳米比亚新产生的制宪议会将在下星期举行首次会议。议会还将起草独立的纳米比亚的第一部宪法并确定国家独立的日期。
    纳米比亚是非洲最后一个尚待独立的国家。西南非洲人民组织是纳米比亚最大的民族主义政党，得到纳米比亚最大部族、约占全国人口50％的奥万博族的支持。现任主席是努乔马。该组织成立于1960年4月19日，其前身是奥万博兰人民组织，后改为西南非洲人民组织。
    1966年8月26日，人组武装力量在卡普里维地区袭击了南非殖民军队，从此开始了武装斗争。1973年，联合国和非洲统一组织承认西南非洲人民组织是纳米比亚人民唯一合法代表。
    长期以来，人组为反对南非当局对纳米比亚的非法占领和殖民统治进行了不屈不挠的斗争。
