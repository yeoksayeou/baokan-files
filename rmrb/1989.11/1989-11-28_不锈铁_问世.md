The Birth of "Stainless Iron"

    A new type of anti-salt and alkali corrosion material, AC2 cast iron, has been developed by the Honghu Industrial Pump Factory in Hubei Province.

    This new material, which is made by adding a small amount of low-alloy materials to ordinary cast iron, can compete with stainless steel in a sodium chloride solution, but its price is only about thirty percent of that of stainless steel. It can be called "stainless cast iron." The new corrosion-resistant industrial pumps made by the Honghu Industrial Pump Factory using this material have been tested and approved by users and experts, reaching the advanced level of similar international products. It is said that the advent of this cast iron has provided a low-cost, long-lasting new material for China's salt and alkali, and fertilizer industries.

　　“不锈铁”问世
    本报武汉电　湖北省洪湖市工业泵厂制成新型抗盐碱腐蚀新材料——AC2铸铁。
    这种往普通铸铁里掺入少量低合金材料的新型材料，在氯化钠溶液中可与不锈钢一比高低，而价格仅为不锈钢的百分之三十，堪称“不锈铸铁”。洪湖工业泵厂用它制成的新型耐腐工业泵，经用户和专家鉴定，性能达到国际同类产品先进水平。据称，这种铸铁的问世，为我国盐碱、化肥工业找到了一种价格低廉、使用寿命长的新材料。
