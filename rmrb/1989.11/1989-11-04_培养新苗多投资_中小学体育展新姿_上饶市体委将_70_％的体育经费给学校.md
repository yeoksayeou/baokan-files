The Shangrao City Sports Commission in Jiangxi is actively collaborating with the education department to promote school sports. Each year, 70% of the sports budget is allocated to schools, resulting in significant improvements in middle and primary school sports. This has not only enhanced students' physical fitness but also nurtured a new generation of athletic talent.

The Sports Commission first worked with the Education Bureau to focus on training physical education teachers. Regular lectures and teaching demonstrations are organized, and in May of this year, 64 physical education teachers were sent to other regions for further training. Through these training sessions, teachers have made significant breakthroughs in teaching methods and techniques, laying a solid foundation for the development of sports in the city's middle and primary schools. Additionally, the Commission has provided training equipment and sportswear, and has developed party members and selected outstanding workers among the physical education teachers, fostering a sense of honor and responsibility. Currently, out of the 87 physical education teachers in the city, several are city people's representatives and members of the political consultative conference, enabling them to promptly convey various opinions and suggestions for developing sports to government departments.

The Sports Commission also collaborates with the education department to organize various competitions and large-scale sports meetings in middle and primary schools, fostering students' interest in sports and stimulating their spirit of progress and competition. Whenever a sports meeting is held, the Commission provides funding, arranges referees, and offers support to improve athletic performance.

Shangrao City's research in middle and primary school sports is also highly valued. The city has established a central research group, organizing physical education teaching research activities. Each middle school has set up a physical education research group, regularly holding seminars to update knowledge and continuously improve the quality of physical education teaching.

    上饶市体委将70％的体育经费给学校
    本报讯　江西上饶市体委积极配合教育部门抓学校体育，每年将70％的经费用于学校体育，使中小学体育发生了很大的变化，不仅增强了学生体质，而且培养出一批批体育新苗。
    市体委首先配合教育局抓体育教师培训，经常安排讲课和观摩教学，今年5月安排了64名体育教师到外地学习。体育教师通过培训，在教学方法和手段上都有新的突破，为全市中小学体育的发展奠定了基础。此外，他们还从生活和政治上关心体育教师，拨给训练器材和运动服装；在体育教师中发展党员，评选先进工作者，使教师有荣誉感和责任感。现在全市87名体育教师中有市人民代表和政协委员，能将发展体育的各种意见和建议及时反映到政府部门。
    市体委还同教育部门一起在中小学中举行各种比赛，举办大型运动会，培育学生体育兴趣，激发进取和竞争精神。每逢举办运动会，体委都出经费，安排裁判，予以支持，提高运动成绩。
    上饶市中小学体育的科研工作也得到重视，全市设置了中心教研组，组织体育教学研究活动。每所中学还建立体育教研组，经常举办讲座，更新知识，不断提高体育教学质量。
