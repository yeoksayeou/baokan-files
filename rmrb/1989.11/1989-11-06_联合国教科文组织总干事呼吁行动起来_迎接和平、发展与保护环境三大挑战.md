The Director-General of UNESCO, Federico Mayor, today stated at a plenary session that peace, development, and environmental protection are the three major challenges facing the world at the end of the century. UNESCO should play its due role around these three goals.

Mayor made these remarks at the end of the general policy debate of this session. He said that while people acknowledge that international relations have improved, they must also see the other side of the problem: peace is not secure, development is very uneven, the international debt crisis is worsening, trade conflicts are continuing, and environmental pollution is becoming more serious. He said that to meet these three challenges, UNESCO must continue to reform, improve its organizational and management capabilities. Member states should work more in coordination, maintain close ties with relevant international organizations, and unite all educators, scientists, and artists to develop human resources, share scientific knowledge, and gradually narrow the gap between industrialized countries and developing countries in this regard.

    联合国教科文组织总干事呼吁行动起来
    迎接和平、发展与保护环境三大挑战
    本报巴黎11月2日电　记者张启华报道：联合国教科文组织总干事马约尔今天在全体会议上指出，和平、发展与保护环境是本世纪末全球面临的三大挑战，教科文组织要围绕这三大目标发挥其应有的作用。
    马约尔总干事是在本届大会总政策辩论结束时发表讲话的，他说，人们承认国际关系有所改善，但也要看到问题的另一方面，即和平并不牢固，发展很不平衡，国际债务危机加剧，世界贸易冲突不断，环境污染更加严重。他说，为了迎接三大挑战，教科文组织要继续进行革新，改善组织和管理能力。各成员国应更协调共事、同国际有关组织保持密切联系，并团结所有的教育、科学工作者、艺术家一起开发人力资源，共同分享科学知识，以便逐步缩小工业化国家和发展中国家在这方面存在的差距。
