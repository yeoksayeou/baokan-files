Hengyang Metallurgical Plant, the largest machinery manufacturing enterprise in China's non-ferrous metal industry, has been shouldering the responsibility of developing machinery and equipment urgently needed for national construction, replacing imported products. Over the past nine years, the plant has digested and absorbed 28 items of imported technology and equipment, developing 11 new products to meet domestic needs and ending the history of dependence on imports. By the end of October this year, the plant's production of products replacing imports has cumulatively saved the country over $110 million in foreign exchange.

Since the 1980s, the country has had to spend a large amount of foreign exchange each year to import advanced machinery and equipment. The plant felt uneasy about this situation and recognized that as a major state-owned machinery manufacturer, it had the responsibility to take on the task of developing products to replace imports and revitalize the national industry. They collaborated with research institutes, based on the digestion and absorption of advanced foreign technologies, combined with national conditions, daringly improved and innovated. At the same time, they strictly organized production according to international technical standards, making the overall quality of many products reach or exceed the level of the same imported products.

    衡冶厂开发新产品替代进口
    9年为国节汇上亿美元
    本报讯　我国有色金属工业最大的机械制造企业——湖南衡阳有色冶金机械总厂为国分忧，瞄准世界先进水平，开发国家建设急需的机械设备，替代进口产品。近9年来，消化、吸收引进技术设备达28项，开发出11种产品保证了国内需要，结束了依赖进口的历史。截至今年10月底止，该厂生产替代进口产品累计可为国家节约外汇支出1.1亿多美元。
    80年代以来，国家每年都要花大量外汇进口先进机械设备，该厂对这一状况感到不安，认识到作为国家大型骨干机械厂，有责任挑起开发替代进口产品、振兴民族工业的重担。他们与科研院所联合，在消化吸收国外先进技术的基础上，结合国情，大胆改进、创新，同时严格按照国际技术标准组织生产，使多项产品整机质量达到或超过引进的同类产品水平。
