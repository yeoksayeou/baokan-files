The "Fushun Cup" Second National Farmers' Photography Art Exhibition was recently held in Beijing. The number of works from Fushun City that were exhibited and awarded accounted for one-third of the total. This achievement is closely related to Fushun City's recent emphasis on supporting farmers in engaging in photography activities.

Fushun City is one of the earliest cities in China to promote photography among farmers. In recent years, cultural departments such as the Fushun City Mass Art Gallery have organized more than 60 farmer photography creation training classes, training over 600 participants. They have also established farmer photography activity groups in some townships and organized personnel to repair cameras for farmers. Currently, the city has formed a team of over 500 farmer photographers.

　　抚顺市农民摄影活动空前活跃
    本报讯　记者钱守仁、傅旭报道：“抚顺杯”全国第二届农民摄影艺术展览近日在京举办，抚顺市农民的参展作品和获奖作品均占1／3。这一成果的取得，与抚顺市近年来重视扶持农民开展摄影活动是分不开的。
    抚顺市是我国开展农民摄影活动较早的一个城市。抚顺市群众艺术馆等文化部门近年举办农民摄影创作培训班60余个，培训学员600余人次，还在一些乡镇建立了农民摄影活动小组，组织专人为农民修理照相机。目前全市区形成一支500余人的农民摄影作者队伍。
