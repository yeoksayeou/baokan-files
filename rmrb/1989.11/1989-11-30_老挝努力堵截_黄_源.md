With the opening up to the outside world, Laos has inevitably encountered the infiltration of decadent Western culture. According to a report in the November 2nd issue of the capital's *Xin Wuxiangbao*, a period of decadent "yellow" culture has been resurging, posing a threat to Laos' beautiful traditional culture. Some young people have fallen victim to this decadent "yellow" culture. Certain owners of private restaurants, entertainment halls, and bars, which were allowed to operate during the reform and opening up, have become purveyors of pornography, turning these places into hotbeds of decadent culture.

To prevent the spread of "yellow" culture, the Lao government's Ministry of Information and Culture issued a notice on August 23rd this year, requiring all levels of leadership and relevant departments to block and stop the import and dissemination of pornographic and obscene films and videotapes. The ministry also announced that the import of foreign films and videotapes would be centralized under the Ministry of Information and Culture, strictly prohibiting government agencies, organizations, enterprises, or individuals from importing them privately. Simultaneously, a deadline was set for the registration of domestic film and video production and screening equipment, as well as films and tapes. The government also established videotape service departments in the four central cities of Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Savannakhet, and Champasak to provide users with healthy content.

The Vientiane city government also conducted inspections of state-owned and private food and entertainment service industries in early September and late October, respectively. On one hand, it prohibited them from signing contracts with foreigners without approval to bring in foreign performing arts groups or individuals for business performances. On the other hand, it encouraged the aforementioned industries to operate national-style singing, dancing, and entertainment activities, promoting national cultural arts. The above venues, after approval by the city's cultural bureau, can introduce some healthy and progressive foreign music programs. The city government also required all restaurants, entertainment halls, and bars not to use dim lighting, not to allow waitresses to hug or kiss customers in the store, not to engage in indecent behavior, and absolutely not to allow customers to take them to other places. Violations will be punished with fines or suspension of business, and in serious cases, will be handed over to the court for sentencing.

Currently, the anti-pornography campaign in Vientiane is in full swing. On October 26th, the city government ordered all restaurants, entertainment halls, and bars to temporarily suspend singing and dancing services for rectification. On November 2nd, the city's Ministry of Information and Culture held a lecture, exposing the harmful effects of "yellow" culture, and requiring all relevant units to strictly implement the various regulations of the Ministry of Information and Culture and the city government.

　　老挝努力堵截“黄”源
　　●文丛●
    随着对外开放，老挝社会也不可避免地遇到了西方腐朽文化的侵袭。据十一月二日的首都《新万象报》报道，一个时期以来，腐朽的黄色文化正在复活，冲击着老挝民族美好的传统文化。一些青年成了腐朽黄色文化的俘虏。某些在改革开放中被允许开业的私营饮食店、娱乐厅和酒吧的店主，充当色情商贩，使这些地方变成了腐朽文化死灰复燃的场所。
    为防止黄色文化泛滥，老挝政府新闻文化部于今年八月二十三日发出通知，要求各级领导和有关部门堵截和制止色情、淫秽影片、录像带的进口和流传，并宣布把外国影片、录像带的进口权统一收归政府新闻文化部，严禁机关团体、企业或个人私自进口；同时限期对国内现有的摄制、放映器材及影片像带进行登记。政府还在万象、琅勃拉邦、沙湾拿吉、占巴塞四个中心城市设立录像带服务部，向用户提供内容健康的录像带。
    万象市政府也于九月初和十月底分别对国营和私营饮食、娱乐服务业进行整顿。一方面禁止他们未经批准私自与外国签订合同，引入外国文艺团体或个人作营业演出；另一方面鼓励上述行业经营具有民族性的歌舞、娱乐活动，倡扬民族文化艺术。上述场所经市文化厅批准可引入一些健康进步的外国音乐节目。市政府同时要求各饮食店、娱乐厅、酒吧不得采用晦暗灯光，不得让女招待在店内与顾客拥抱、接吻，不得有猥亵举动，更不允许顾客将她们带往他处。如有违犯，将依照情节轻重处以罚款或勒令停业直至提交法庭判刑。
    目前，万象市的扫黄工作正在紧张进行。十月二十六日市政府已下令各饮食店、娱乐厅、酒吧暂时停止歌舞服务活动，进行整顿。十一月二日，市新闻文化厅召开了宣讲会，揭露黄色文化的毒害现象，要求各有关单位严格执行新闻文化部和市政府的各项规定。
