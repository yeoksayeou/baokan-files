In the past year and a half, Henan Province has achieved notable results in its comprehensive agricultural development by focusing on transforming low- and medium-yield fields, promoting balanced development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. The province has added 401.5 million mu (approximately 26.77 million acres) of drought-resistant and flood-resistant fields, planted 47 million mu of forests, treated 3,400 square kilometers of small watersheds, and constructed 41.8 million mu of terraced fields. These efforts have laid a solid foundation for the province's grain production to exceed 30 billion kilograms for the first time this year.

Henan is frequently affected by droughts and floods, with 70% of its fields being low- and medium-yield. To address this, the province initiated a comprehensive agricultural development plan in early 1988, dividing the province into three major areas: the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain agricultural area, the mountainous and hilly dry farming area, and the Jiang-Huai rice-wheat area. To ensure the success of this plan, the province, municipalities, counties, and townships established leadership groups headed by their respective government leaders. The performance of these groups in completing their development tasks is a key indicator of their overall performance.

	•	Focusing on key areas, implementing comprehensive development in a concentrated manner. To enhance the province's ability to withstand droughts and floods, the province has prioritized agricultural water conservancy projects as part of its comprehensive transformation of low- and medium-yield fields. The Huang-Huai-Hai development area has allocated more than 60% of its development funds to water conservancy projects, following the principle of integrating economic, social, and ecological benefits. The area has adopted a strategy of tackling easier tasks first and gradually expanding its scope, aiming to see results as soon as possible. Last year, the area's 18.4 million mu of low- and medium-yield field transformation tasks were assigned to 163 townships; this year's 26.6 million mu of tasks are concentrated in 219 townships, forming a contiguous development zone. The mountainous and hilly dry farming area has combined engineering measures with biological measures, implementing comprehensive treatment of mountains, water, soil, grass, and fields. The treated small watersheds have largely met the standards of acacia tree canopy, fruit tree belts, and fertile fields.

	•	Introducing competition and constraint mechanisms to secure and utilize funds effectively. According to the plan, the Huang-Huai-Hai development area requires a certain amount of matching funds from the province each year. Despite financial difficulties, the provincial government allocated 400 million yuan last year and has already allocated 200 million yuan this year. The province has adopted a policy of "allocating funds first, investing later, more allocation means more investment, less allocation means less investment, no allocation means no investment" for the development projects. It has also implemented a public bidding system for development projects, prioritizing areas with high development potential and enthusiasm. This has shifted the mindset of local governments and farmers from "the state provides funds, we have to do it" to "we raise funds, we want to do it." Last year, various municipalities and counties allocated an additional 60 million yuan, and farmers raised more than 700 million yuan; this year's matching funds have also been secured at 67.9%. To ensure the effective use of development funds, various localities have implemented a "three-specifics and four-defines" management system, which includes designated personnel, designated accounts, and designated uses for the funds, as well as defined development tasks, investment amounts, repayment times, and reward and punishment mechanisms. Additionally, a robust audit supervision system has been established to ensure that the funds are truly used for agricultural development.

	•	Relying on technological progress to enhance development benefits. While promoting a spirit of dedication, the province has actively addressed the practical issues faced by scientific and technological personnel in their work and life. It has also established research awards and technology promotion awards to encourage scientific and technological personnel to participate in the development. Currently, 298 scientific and technological personnel from central government research institutions are involved in the province's agricultural development, and nearly 10,000 personnel within the province are dedicated to this cause. They have promoted more than 220 technological achievements, effectively promoting the development of agriculture, especially grain production, across the province. The Xinyang region, located in the Jiang-Huai rice-wheat area, has implemented a technological contract system. This year, the region's 10.56 million mu of hybrid rice has an average yield of 557.6 kilograms per mu, an increase of 174 kilograms per mu compared to conventional rice.

    突出重点　用活资金　依靠科技
　　河南农业区域综合开发收效大
    一年多来新增旱涝保收田401.5万亩，造林470万亩，治理小流域3400平方公里，为全省今年粮食首次超过300亿公斤打下基础
    本报讯　河南省农业区域综合开发，以改造中低产田为重点，坚持农林牧副渔全面发展，取得了明显成效。一年多来，全省新增旱涝保收田401.5万亩，造林470万亩，治理小流域3400平方公里，建设水平梯田41.8万亩。在开发区的带动下，今年全省粮食总产首次超过300亿公斤。
    河南旱涝灾害频繁，中低产田占70％，粮食产量低而不稳。去年初，省里确定，农业综合开发分黄淮海平原农业区、山区丘陵旱作区和江淮稻麦区三大块逐步推开。为此，省、市（地）、县、乡均成立了由政府主要负责同志任组长的农业开发领导小组，并把各地开发任务完成得好坏作为考核政府工作的重要标准之一。
    ——突出重点，集中连片，实行综合开发。为了提高抗御旱涝灾害的能力，他们开展了以农田水利建设为重点的中低产田综合改造。黄淮海开发区把60％以上的开发资金用于建设水利工程，遵循经济效益、社会效益和生态效益有机统一的原则，先易后难，逐步扩展，力求开发一片见效一片。去年，该开发区的184万亩中低产田改造任务，安排在163个乡进行；今年的266万亩改造任务又集中到219个乡，与去年的连成一片。山区丘陵旱作区坚持工程措施和生物措施相结合，实行山水土草田综合治理，已治理的小流域，基本达到刺槐封顶、果树缠腰、良田座底标准。
    ——引入竞争机制和约束机制，筹好用好资金。按要求，黄淮海开发区每年需要该省配套一定数额开发资金，省财政在十分困难的情况下，去年及时配齐了4000万元，今年已配2000万元。省里下拨开发资金，实行“先配后投，多配多投，少配少投，不配不投”，对开发项目公开招标，把资金优先投到开发潜力大、积极性高的地方，使各级政府和广大农民由过去的国家拿钱“要我干”转变为自己凑钱“我要干”。去年，各市（地）、县财政超配600万元，农民集资7000多万元；今年的配套资金也已落实67.9％。对开发资金各地普遍实行了专人负责、专户储存、专款专用和定开发任务、定投资额度、定还款时间、定奖罚制度的“三专四定”管理办法，并建立健全了审计监督制度，确保其真正用于农业开发。
    ——依靠科技进步，提高开发效益。省里在倡导奉献精神的同时，积极为科技人员解决工作、生活的实际问题，并设立科研奖和科技成果推广奖，从精神、物质两方面鼓励科技人员投入开发。目前，中直科研部门有298名科技人员参加该省的农业开发，省内投入农业开发的有近万名。他们先后推广各种科技成果220多项，有效地促进了全省农业特别是粮食生产的发展。地处江淮稻麦区的信阳地区实行科技承包后，今年的105.6万亩杂交稻平均亩产达557.6公斤，比常规稻增产174公斤。
