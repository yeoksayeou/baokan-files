The People's Liberation Army 163 Hospital has made a significant breakthrough in the diagnosis of typhoid fever by utilizing the freeze-dried erythrocyte micro-quantitative reverse indirect agglutination test for rapid detection.

Previously, diagnosis relied on blood culture and bacterial testing, which took at least three days to yield results. Often, by the time the diagnosis was confirmed, the patient's condition had already changed dramatically, making it difficult for clinicians to provide timely and effective treatment. While foreign countries have adopted automated testing methods, the equipment and reagents required are expensive. The promotion of the reverse indirect agglutination test for rapid detection does not require specialized equipment, and ordinary laboratories can perform the test. The diagnostic time is reduced to just one day.

　　诊断伤寒有新法
    新华社长沙11月25日电　（通讯员伍水清）解放军163医院运用冻干血球微量反向间接血凝试验快速检测法，使伤寒病的诊断获得新的突破。
    以往诊断靠通过血液细菌培养进行检测，结果最短也要3天以上，往往是诊断结果出来，病人病情已发生急剧变化，临床不能及时组织有效救治。国外虽然采用自动化检测，但仪器、试剂价格昂贵。推广反向间接血凝试验快速检测法，检测不需特殊的仪器设备，普通试验室都可进行，诊断时间只需一天。
