Why is it so difficult to break the chain?
— Reflections on clearing inter-enterprise arrears (Part II)

The debt chain is draining enterprises of their strength, making the entire economy laborious. Some even predict that if the trend of enterprise arrears is not effectively curbed, a large-scale payment crisis may occur, potentially leading to an economic downturn.

However, why is the call for clearing arrears so strong, yet the actual results so meager? What is causing the difficulty in clearing enterprise arrears?

One view is that the state's insufficient or untimely allocation of funds for planned construction projects is to blame. According to a survey by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China on 20 large enterprises with construction projects, 62% of the current nationwide construction arrears are due to unallocated planned funds. Thus, some construction enterprises feel justified in owing money to others. A steel company in Shanghai currently owes a machinery factory 100 million yuan, but when a supplier came to collect the debt, the company's leader showed no remorse: "It's not me who owes you, it's the state who owes you!"

The inability of construction units to repay debts has caused many enterprises that produce supporting products for the construction industry to be wary of clearing arrears. For example, four large enterprises in Lanzhou, including Lanzhou Electric Machinery Factory and Lanzhou Power Repair and Manufacturing Factory, owe a total of 900 million yuan, while they are owed 1.3 billion yuan. Because their customers are construction units, when the bank "provides services at the doorstep," the enterprises explain their predicament of "only paying out, with no return" and refuse to clear arrears.

Others believe that the severe depletion of enterprises' own funds is the cause. Authoritative data confirms that in recent years, industrial output has grown by 17% annually, but enterprises' own funds have not increased. Just this factor alone results in an annual shortfall of 200 million yuan for industrial enterprises in Xi'an. Additionally, the continuous rise in raw material prices has further devalued enterprises' nominal funds. According to a survey of 216 industrial enterprises in Nanjing, the increased fund usage due to this factor alone reached 480 million yuan by June of this year. The reduction in enterprises' actual funds leads to the phenomenon of enterprises being unable to pay for goods in transactions.

Some say it is due to the tightness of railway transportation, affecting product delivery, and so on.

However, if we delve deeper, we will find that the difficulty in resolving the debt chain has more profound reasons.

For example, industrial structure imbalance and product structure imbalance. Currently, there is a large-scale accumulation of finished products nationwide, including cold, obsolete, and stagnant goods. However, the enterprises producing these products continue to produce without hesitation. Thus, the more products accumulate, the more they borrow and owe; forced to sell on credit, the more they sell on credit, the more they are owed. A chemical machinery factory in Lanzhou, for instance, had poor sales last year but continued to produce. By the end of June this year, products without sales contracts accounted for 64%.

Another example is the chaos in credit. According to a survey by the Hebei Provincial Department of Industry and Commerce on 86,000 enterprises in the province, 1.37 billion yuan of the owed funds include many instances where enterprises suffered losses due to "verbal credit." The Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Local Products Foreign Trade Company in Guantao County simultaneously signed a total contract of 4.725 million yuan for fertilizer with a company in Inner Mongolia, paying the full amount in advance, only to find that the other party lacked the ability to fulfill the contract. This not only caused a direct economic loss of over 600,000 yuan but also resulted in 3.99 million yuan being lost in another region, making it impossible to recover, plunging the entire county's economy into a predicament.

There is also the issue of parochialism. Since bank loans account for a significant portion of enterprises' operating funds, many of the arrears are now bank loans. Thus, during a period of tight monetary policy, some local governments intervene in the flow of funds with administrative measures to ensure the economic development of their regions: they hold back on repaying owed goods, while instructing banks to assist in clearing arrears when owed goods.

Enterprise parochialism is even more pronounced. Factory directors and managers are indeed anxious about clearing arrears, but their anxiety is limited to collecting debts. As for how to repay the debts owed, they haven't thought about it. A chemical factory in Shanghai owes 80 million yuan, and when the creditors came to collect, the attitude of the factory's responsible person was as if the other party owed him money: "I can't give you the money; if I do, how will I organize production in the future?" Many are eager to collect debts, but few are willing to repay them. The secret is not deep: after all, there is no interest on money owed to others, so why not?

There are also instances of bank parochialism. Some banks, focusing solely on their own interests, disregard settlement discipline and arbitrarily withhold or delay settlement funds going to other regions or banks, artificially increasing the arrears of goods. According to a check of 3,200 vouchers from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China in Sheyang County, Jiangsu Province at the beginning of this year, 300 vouchers were blocked, accounting for 9.4%. The Beijing Pharmaceutical Company's collection of 2,766 yuan from a company in Hubei in August last year was only received by March 31 this year.

### 解“链”缘何这样难——对清理企业间拖欠货款的思考（中）

    解“链”缘何这样难
    ——对清理企业间拖欠货款的思考（中）
    本报记者　潘岗
    债务链，拖得企业精疲力竭，拖得整个经济步履维艰。有人甚至预言，如果企业拖欠的势头得不到有效遏止，很可能发生大规模的支付危机，进而有可能导致经济滑坡。
    然而，为什么各界清欠的呼声甚高，而实际清欠的成效尚微？是何物作祟，才使企业清欠如此艰难？
    国家对计划内基建项目拨款不足或不能按期到位所致，这是一种看法。据工商银行对20个有基建项目的大型企业测算，目前全国基建拖欠中，计划内资金未落实的占62％。于是一些基建企业欠人家钱款心安理得。上海一家钢铁公司目前欠机械厂款达1亿元，但当某配套厂上门催款时，公司领导人毫无疚色：不是我欠你的，是国家欠你的！
    基建单位还债无望，引发了许多为基建行业生产配套产品的企业对清欠的惊悸心理。兰州电机厂、兰州电力修造厂等4家大型企业，欠人金额9000多万元，人欠资金1.3亿元，就由于其用户是基建单位，当银行“服务上门”时，企业诉以“只有付出，没有收回”的苦衷，谢绝清欠。
    也有人认为，是企业自有资金严重亏空所致。权威资料证实，近几年工业产值年增长都在17％，而企业自有资金却一直未见增加，仅此，西安地区工业企业每年就有2亿元亏空。另外，连年原材料价格轮番上涨，又使企业名义资金贬值。据对南京市216户工业企业调查，今年6月企业因此增加的资金占用就达4.8亿元。企业实际资金减少，导致在商品交易中企业无款承付现象的发生。
    还有人说，是铁路运输紧张，影响产品发运，等等。
    然而，如果我们深入分析就会发现，债务链难解，还有更深的原因。
    譬如产业结构失调，产品结构失调。目前，全国产成品大面积积压，其中不乏冷、背、呆、滞商品，可那些生产这些产品的企业照“产”不误。于是，产品积压越多，越借债欠人；不得已大力赊销，越赊销越被人欠。兰州某化工机器厂，去年产品销路就不畅，却仍加紧生产，到今年6月末，没有销售合同的“预测产品”就占64％。
    又如信用混乱，据河北省工商局对全省8.6万个企业调查，这些企业13.7亿元人欠资金中，有不少是吃了“口头信用”的亏。馆陶县供销社贸易公司、土产外贸公司同时与内蒙古某公司签订了总额472.5万元的化肥购销合同，预付全部货款后才发现对方不具备履约能力，不仅造成直接经济损失60多万元，而且399万元巨款流落在外地无法收回，使全县经济陷入困境。
    再如本位主义。由于银行贷款在企业经营资金中占有较大比重，如今企业的拖欠款有不少就是银行贷款。于是，在货币政策收紧之时，一些地方政府为保证本地区的经济发展，以行政手段干预资金流向：欠人货款顶住不还，人欠货款则指示银行协助清欠。
    企业“本位”更为突出。厂长、经理为清欠着急，这的确是事实，但他们着急的，仅仅限于讨债，至于欠人的债如何还，对不起，还没想过。上海某石化厂欠人8000万元，当债主上门，这家工厂负责人的态度，倒像对方欠了他的债：不能给啊，给了你我日后怎么组织生产啊！讨债者众，还债者少。个中奥秘其实并不深奥：反正欠别人的钱不拿利息，何乐而不为？
    银行本位也时有所闻。有的银行只顾自身利益，仅仅为了资金在银行多滞留增加点银行收入，就不顾结算纪律，随意扣压、延宕往外地或他行的结算资金，人为地增加拖欠货款。据对江苏省射阳县工商银行、农业银行今年初的3200张凭证抽查，汇路受阻的就有300张，占9.4％。北京医药公司去年8月向湖北某企业托收货款2766元，到今年3月31日才收到货款。
