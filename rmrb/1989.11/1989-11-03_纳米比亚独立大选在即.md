Namibia's independence election is approaching. Between November 7th and 11th, Namibia will hold elections to select members of the constituent assembly, with major preparatory work largely completed.

To implement the UN Security Council's Resolution 435, and based on agreements reached by relevant parties, the UN has, since the beginning of this year, dispatched 4,650 peacekeeping troops, 1,500 police officers, 760 civilian administrators, and 1,395 election supervisors to Namibia. Additionally, 820 local staff have been hired. Under the joint efforts of the UN and the South African administrator in Namibia, the repatriation of refugees has been completed, with 41,000 refugees returning to Namibia. The number of registered voters is 701,483, of which 248,000 are from the Ovambo tribe, accounting for 35% of the total voters. Currently, 10 political parties have registered to participate in the election, competing for 72 seats in the constituent assembly. The main contenders will be the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA). According to Namibia's election law, voters will cast their ballots at 350 polling stations. The UN and relevant parties will select members from the candidate lists provided by each party based on the number of votes received, a system known as "proportional representation." The election results will be announced three days after voting. The party securing two-thirds of the seats will have the right to draft the constitution and form the government.

During the election preparations, the situation in Namibia has remained relatively stable, although violent incidents have occurred. According to relevant regulations, South African authorities must withdraw their troops stationed in Namibia back to South Africa by July 1, 1989, leaving only 1,500 soldiers whose activities are restricted to military camps. The South African administrator in Namibia relies on 500 South African police officers to maintain social order, but their activities are supervised by UN personnel. UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar criticized the South African police for not cooperating well with UN police, resulting in many criminal cases going uninvestigated. De Cuéllar also criticized South Africa for being slow in disbanding the "anti-riot" forces.

To ensure the smooth progress of Namibia's independence election, SWAPO and the DTA, along with seven other participating parties, signed a "Code of Conduct" prohibiting the use of force during the election period. Despite this, supporters of SWAPO and the DTA have had conflicts. In early October, clashes occurred in northern Namibia, resulting in multiple casualties. The UN Special Representative in Namibia condemned these "meaningless violent acts" and urgently met with the South African administrator in Namibia to discuss measures to prevent such incidents from recurring.

The policies of various parties after the election have become clearer. On October 19th, South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha visited Namibia and held "constructive talks" with SWAPO Chairman Sam Nujoma. After the meeting, Botha stated that South Africa would accept the results of a free and fair election, regardless of which party wins. Nujoma, upon his return, repeatedly stated that socialism is superior to capitalism, but his organization, if victorious in the election, would not implement economic nationalization policies. However, the state would control natural resources to ensure that the Namibian people benefit economically while allowing foreign and domestic capital to gain necessary profits. Therefore, he announced that SWAPO has no political intention of implementing a one-party system and will pursue a "mixed economy" policy. The DTA declared its opposition to socialism in Namibia, advocating for private enterprise ownership but allowing government intervention.

Currently, the preparations for Namibia's election are in the final stages. To observe and understand the true situation of the election, 23 countries have established official observation agencies in Windhoek, with an estimated 1,400 foreign journalists expected to cover the election.

    纳米比亚独立大选在即
    史非
    11月7日—11日，纳米比亚将举行大选，选举制宪议会议员，主要准备工作基本就绪。
    联合国为实施安理会435号决议，根据有关方面达成的协议，从今年初开始，先后向纳米比亚派出和平维持部队4650人，警察1500人，文职行政人员760人，选举监督员1395人，此外还雇佣了820个当地人员。在联合国和南非驻纳米比亚行政长官共同努力下，难民遣返工作业已完成，已有41000难民返回纳米比亚。选民登记人数为701483人，其中奥万博族选民为248000人，占选民总数的35％。目前已有10个政党登记参加大选，竞选72个制宪议会议员席位。最大竞争者将是西南非洲人民组织和特恩哈尔民主联盟两大政党。根据纳米比亚独立选举法，选民分别到350个投票点投票。联合国和有关方面将根据各政党得票的多少，从它们提供的候选人名单中按顺序选出议员。这被称为“按比例选举制”。投票后3天公布选举结果。获得2／3多数议席的政党有权起草独立宪法和组织政府。
    在大选准备工作期间，纳米比亚局势基本稳定，但暴力活动时有发生。根据有关规定，1989年7月1日之前，南非当局必须把驻扎在纳米比亚的军队撤回南非，留下的1500名军人的活动需限制在军营内；南非驻纳米比亚行政长官依赖500名南非警察负责维持社会秩序，但这些警察的活动由联合国人员监督。联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔谴责南非警察没有很好地同联合国警察合作，致使许多违法案件没有得到调查。德奎利亚尔还批评南非在解散“防暴”部队等问题上行动迟缓。
    为使纳米比亚独立大选进展顺利，西南非人组和特恩哈尔民主联盟等另外7个参加竞选的党派签订了一项“行动准则”，规定禁止在大选期间以武力相威胁。尽管如此，西南非人组和特恩哈尔民主联盟的支持者仍发生过冲突。10月初，双方在纳米比亚北部发生冲突，伤亡多人。联合国驻纳米比亚特别代表谴责这种“无意义的暴力行动”，并紧急约见南非驻纳米比亚行政长官，讨论了如何制止此类事件再次发生。
    有关各方对纳米比亚大选后的政策已趋向明朗。10月19日，南非外长博塔访问纳米比亚时，同西南非人组主席努乔马举行了“建设性会谈”。会后博塔表示，不论哪个政党在大选中获胜，南非都将接受自由和公正选举结果。努乔马回国后多次表示，社会主义要比资本主义优越，但他的组织大选获胜后，不实行经济国有化政策，当然国家要控制自然资源，既使纳米比亚人民得到经济实惠，又使外国和本国资本获得必要的利润。因此他宣布，西南非洲人民组织政治上无意实行一党制，经济上将执行“混合经济”政策。特恩哈尔民主联盟宣称，它反对在纳米比亚实行社会主义，主张搞企业私有化，但政府有权对其实行干预。
    目前，纳米比亚大选准备工作已到最后阶段。为观察和了解大选真实情况，迄今已有23个国家在温得和克设立了官方观察机构，估计届时将有1400名外国记者前往采访大选情况。
