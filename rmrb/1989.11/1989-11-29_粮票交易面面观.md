Grain tickets, a unique form of non-valued securities in China, were introduced to ensure the grain supply for urban residents and other non-agricultural populations, stabilize grain prices, eliminate grain speculation, and further consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants. In November 1953, the State Council issued an order to implement a planned and phased grain procurement and distribution system nationwide. In 1955, the State Council issued another order on the temporary measures for the planned supply of grain to urban and town residents, deciding to implement a rationing system for the grain needs of the non-agricultural population. Thus, the grain ticket was born as a voucher for purchasing grain.

Over the 30-plus years since the issuance of grain tickets, they have played a crucial role in ensuring grain supply. Given China's current grain production and demand situation, the system of grain supply based on grain tickets is unlikely to be abolished in the near future. However, in recent years, a serious issue has emerged that disrupts grain supply—grain ticket transactions.

In many urban areas, various forms of grain ticket transactions are common. Grain tickets are used to exchange for eggs, agricultural by-products, plastic products, stainless steel tableware, and more. From markets to residential areas, how many grain tickets have entered this "circulation" domain? Perhaps no one can provide an accurate number.

What problems does the priced transaction of grain tickets bring? What corresponding measures should be taken to address these issues? This article explores some of these questions and provides references for consideration.

Recently, readers from various places have continuously reported to our newspaper about issues related to the priced transaction of grain tickets. For this reason, the reporter conducted some investigations on the relevant situation and found that this is an issue in economic life that cannot be avoided.

Drip by drip becomes a stream: Grain ticket transactions form a large market

Currently, China has nearly 220 million urban residents and non-agricultural rural populations. If we calculate an average monthly ration of 15 kilograms per person, the annual grain demand is nearly 40 billion kilograms. In recent years, with the improvement of living standards and the increase in the variety of food, the dietary structure has changed significantly. The current rationing standards from the 1960s and 1970s have far exceeded the actual consumption. Incomplete statistics at the end of 1988 show that currently, there are 25 billion kilograms of surplus grain tickets in the hands of urban residents nationwide, averaging nearly 100 kilograms per person.

The massive surplus of grain tickets provides the material basis for grain ticket transactions, while the grain needs of non-urban residents provide a broad market. Currently, there are nearly 90 million migrant workers in cities, and a significant portion of the surplus grain of urban residents is consumed by them. Additionally, there are many specialized livestock farmers, agricultural traders, catering businesses, and light industrial enterprises that need grain. Nationwide, the alcohol industry alone consumes over 13 billion kilograms of grain annually, which the state's limited grain supply cannot meet. Many small enterprises that need to "find grain for the pot" can only participate in the grain ticket transaction cycle. Some grain-deficient remote areas also have a demand for the surplus grain of residents, and a few farmers exchange grain tickets for their own use or to pay public grain. Thus, grain ticket transactions have thrived.

The wool comes from the sheep: The government bears a heavy burden

For urban residents, grain tickets are originally valueless and have little use when surplus, so exchanging them for practical items and food is a welcome opportunity. Non-urban grain users solve their needs, and "grain speculators" make a fortune. In this transaction, all participants benefit, but the government bears a heavy burden.

According to a colleague from the Ministry of Commerce, the current rationed grain, with each 500 grams of flour priced at about 0.18 yuan, while the contract procurement price for each 500 grams of wheat is about 0.23 yuan; each 500 grams of rice is priced at about 0.16 yuan, while the contract procurement price for each 500 grams of paddy is about 0.21 yuan. Including procurement and sales costs, the state subsidizes each 500 grams of rationed grain by about 0.20 yuan. In 1988, the state subsidized over 24 billion yuan, accounting for half of the state's total financial subsidies. Additionally, the state purchases a large amount of negotiated-priced and imported grain each year, supplying it to urban residents and other non-agricultural populations at the price of rationed grain. Farmers annually sell 500 billion kilograms of grain to the state, which reduces their income by tens of billions of yuan compared to selling on the market. Farmers' contributions are also distributed through administrative means in each small grain ticket.

To motivate farmers to produce grain, the state has repeatedly raised the procurement price of rationed grain. This year in April, with an increase of 1 jiao per kilogram, the state paid out nearly 3 billion yuan. To mitigate the impact of the increased procurement price of rationed grain on residents, the state also distributes a grain price subsidy of 5 yuan per person per month to over 200 million urban residents, totaling over 13 billion yuan annually. Moreover, the government's grain procurement departments must bear the pressure of increasing interest rates on loans for the procurement of rationed grain.

However, the costs and subsidies paid by the state partially flow into the profits of "grain speculators" through grain ticket transactions. Beijing needs about 11 billion yuan annually for grain procurement and sales, with the rest procured from various places nationwide at negotiated prices of 0.80 yuan for each 500 grams of rice and 0.50 yuan for each 500 grams of wheat. Last year, Beijing alone subsidized 11 billion yuan for grain procurement and sales. Yet, a large amount of grain flows out annually. Shanghai also has a significant amount of grain taken away by "grain speculators," resulting in an annual local deficit of 5 billion yuan for the grain department.

An old saying: If there's no bowl in the pot, there's no rice in the bowl

When residents throw away leftover food and eat eggs exchanged with grain tickets, the hunger from grain shortages and natural disasters three years ago seems very distant. The grain issue has become a headache for economists and government officials, but for every person who eats rationed grain, it feels so unfamiliar.

Numbers may be dull, but they cast a shadow over each of us. Last year, China's disaster situation was quite severe, with over 700 million mu of crops affected, including over 70 million mu of complete crop failures, resulting in a grain reduction of 5.4 billion kilograms. Many places' farmers cannot buy subsidized fertilizers and other agricultural production materials, and cannot sell grain for cash, thus unwilling to sell the contracted public grain. We still face the annual increase of 15 million mouths to feed and the annual 5% reduction in arable land, among other severe issues.

These crises are not far from every citizen who eats grain; they specifically affect every urban resident participating in grain ticket transactions. If we continue to allow grain tickets to become valued securities in circulation, there is another issue often overlooked: that is, it is equivalent to the state issuing an additional 100 billion yuan, which will exacerbate inflation and add another potential factor for price increases affecting everyone.

Diverse opinions: Can the problem be solved without risk?

Given that grain ticket transactions bring so many problems, why can't this phenomenon be eliminated for a long time? As early as September 15, 1979, the former Ministry of Grain and the Administration for Industry and Commerce jointly issued a notice stating: "Grain tickets are non-valued securities and cannot be bought or sold. They cannot be used as currency... Any illegal behavior of using grain tickets as valued securities to exchange for goods must be strictly prohibited." Article 120 of the Criminal Law also stipulates: "Those who, for profit, forge or resell planned supply tickets and certificates, with serious circumstances, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention." However, the law does not punish the majority, and in the face of grain ticket transactions across the country, the Administration for Industry and Commerce is at a loss, as some people say: "The dual-track pricing of grain, surplus grain tickets, and the price differences between provinces and cities are the latent factors for 'grain speculation.' Without strong policy intervention, the tightening of the law enforcement net will still be ineffective."

To strengthen the management of grain tickets, some provinces and cities have taken measures such as limiting the quantity and designated points for purchasing grain with grain tickets. Beijing has taken measures in the past two years to set up checkpoints at major transportation hubs to restrict the outflow of grain. Shanghai has canceled the supply of subsidized cooking oil since July 1, 1987, and implemented a system where residents can purchase half a kilogram of subsidized cooking oil with the original special oil tickets plus 5 kilograms of grain tickets. Some cities in Sichuan Province have implemented a system for purchasing surplus grain from residents in urban areas at negotiated prices starting from February this year. These measures have achieved some effects but have not fundamentally solved the problems of grain ticket transactions and "grain speculation," and some have brought other negative effects.

Currently, some people suggest converting the hidden subsidies on grain prices to explicit subsidies and reducing the rationing standards that have been in place since the 1960s and 1970s; others suggest that the fundamental solution to this problem lies in the overall framework of grain procurement and sales system reform, opening up this link. However, all schemes are interconnected and involve considerable risks. In any case, we cannot avoid the issue of grain ticket transactions, and before solving it, this shadow will hang over us and become increasingly larger.

    粮票交易面面观
　　本报记者　宋斌
    粮票，是我国特有的一种无价证券。为了保障城镇居民和其他非农业人口的粮食供应，保障国家建设所需要的粮食，稳定粮价，消灭粮食投机，进一步巩固工农联盟，1953年11月，政务院发布在全国范围内有计划有步骤地实行粮食统购统销的命令；1955年，国务院发布关于市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法的命令，决定对非农业人口所需的粮食实行定量供应。作为购粮凭证的粮票诞生了。
    粮票发行30多年来，为保障粮食供给起了很重要的作用。根据我国目前的粮食生产和需求状况，凭粮票供应粮食的制度在近期内还不可能取消。但是，近年来出现了一个严重干扰粮食供应的问题——粮票交易。
    在许多城镇，形形色色的粮票交易现象屡见不鲜。粮票被人们用来换鸡蛋、农副产品、塑料制品、不锈钢餐具……从集市到住宅，到底有多少粮票进入了这种“流通”领域？恐怕谁也无法提供一个准确的数字。
    粮票有价交易带来了哪些问题？应该采取哪些相应的对策加以解决？本文作了一些探讨，可供参考。·编者·
    最近一段时间，各地一些读者不断向本报反映粮票有价交易中的问题。为此，记者就有关情况做了一些调查，发现这是一个经济生活中不能回避的问题。
    滴水成流：粮票交易形成大市场
    我国目前城镇居民和农村非农业人口近2.2亿，如果按每人月平均定量15公斤计算，全年粮食总需求量近400亿公斤。近年来，由于人们生活水平的提高和副食品的增多，食物结构已发生了很大的变化，现有的六七十年代的定量已大大超过了实际消费量。1988年底的不完全统计表明，现在，全国城镇居民手中的富余粮票已达250亿公斤，平均每人近100公斤。
    巨额的富余粮票为粮票交易提供了物质基础，而非城镇居民的用粮需要又为之提供了广阔市场。目前，全国有近9000万务工经商的进城农民，城镇居民的剩余粮有很大部分被他们消费了。另外，还有大量的农村饲养专业户、农贸小贩、饮食业及需要用粮的轻工企业。全国仅酿酒业每年的耗粮就在130亿公斤以上，国家有限的供应粮根本无法满足如此巨大的需要。大批“找粮下锅”的小企业只能参与到粮票交易的循环圈之中。部分缺粮的边远山区也对居民们的富余粮有着需求，还有少数农民换回粮票自家用，或者抵交公粮。这样，粮票交易便兴旺起来。羊毛出在羊身上：政府承受着沉重负担
    对于城镇居民来说，粮票本来是无价的，剩余下来并无多大用处，能换点实用的东西和副食品何乐而不为；非城镇用粮一方得之便解决了需求，“粮倒”们从中更是大发横财。在这场交易中，参与者利益均沾，政府却承受着沉重负担。
    据商业部的同志介绍，现在定量供应的粮食，面粉每500克售价0.18元左右，而每500克麦子的合同定购价却是0.23元左右；大米每500克售价0.16元左右，而每500克稻谷的合同定购价却是0.21元左右，加上购销费用，国家对每500克定量粮都要补贴0.20元左右，1988年全国补贴了240亿元以上，占国家所有财政补贴的半数。此外，国家每年还要购买大量的议价粮和进口粮食，按平价粮的价格供给城镇居民和其他非农人口。农民每年交售500亿公斤粮食给国家，这要比在市场上出售减少收入几十亿元。农民的贡献也通过行政手段分解在每一张小小粮票中。
    为了调动农民种粮的积极性，国家几次提高平价粮食的收购价。今年4月，这次每公斤提高1角，国家就一次掏出了近30亿元。为了减轻平价粮收购价上提给居民们带来的影响，国家还给两亿多城镇居民每人每月发放粮价补贴5元钱，一年下来就是130多亿元。而且政府的粮食收购部门还要承受不断增长的征收平价粮贷款的利率带来的压力。
    但是，国家付出的代价和补贴，一部分却随着粮票交易流入了“粮倒”们的利润之中。北京市每年需要的粮食，除国家计划平价拨给一部分外，余下均以每500克大米0.80元，小麦0.50元的议价从全国各地调入，去年北京市仅粮食购销就补贴了11亿元。可是每年却有大量粮食流走。上海市每年也被“粮倒”们倒走不少粮食，为此上海市粮食部门每年的地方性亏损高达5亿元。老生常谈：锅里没有碗里就没有
    当居民们把剩饭倒入垃圾之中，吃着粮票换来的鸡蛋的时候，缺粮、三年自然灾害时的饥饿感已经非常遥远了。粮食问题仅仅成了令经济学家和政府官员们焦头烂额的问题，对每一个吃定量粮的人却是那么陌生。
    数字虽然枯燥无味，但它却是笼罩在我们每一个人头上的阴影。去年我国灾情相当严重，全国农作物受灾面积7亿多亩，其中7000多万亩绝收，粮食减产54亿公斤。不少地方的农民由于不能买到平价化肥等农用生产资料，售粮拿不到现金，因而不愿交售定购公粮。我们还要面临每年递增的1500万张吃粮的嘴巴，以及每年按5％递减的可耕地等严峻问题。
    这些危机离每个吃粮的公民并不遥远，它具体关系到每一个参与粮票交易的城镇居民。如果我们继续默许粮票成为有价的证券流通，那么还有一个为更多人所忽略的问题，那就是说，相当于国家多发行了100多亿元人民币，更将加剧通货膨胀，等于多了一个关系到每个人的涨价的潜在因素。众说纷纭：能够无风险地解决问题吗？
    既然粮票交易带来这么多问题，为何长期不能杜绝粮票交易这种现象呢？早在1979年9月15日，原粮食部和工商行政管理局就在《关于纠正违反粮票使用规定的通知》中规定：“粮票属于无价证券，不得进行买卖，不允许当货币使用……凡是把粮票当作有价证券用以换购物品的违法行为，必须严加禁止。”刑法第120条也规定：“以营利为目的，伪造或者倒卖计划供应票证，情节严重的处三年以下有期徒刑或者拘役。”结果呢，法不责众，面对遍及全国的粮票交易，工商行政管理部门是堵不胜堵，正如有的人所说：“粮食价格的双轨制、多余的粮票和各省市之间粮食价格的地方差，是‘倒粮’的潜在因素。如果没有强有力的政策性干预，法网的收缩仍将显得无力。”
    为加强粮票的管理，部分省市已采取了如凭粮证限量、定点购粮等措施。北京市前两年已采取在主要运输路口，设卡把关，限制粮食外流。上海市从1987年7月1日起取消了平价食油的供应，实行凭原来专用油票加5公斤粮票购买半公斤平价食油的办法。四川省个别城市从今年2月起在城区实行议价收购居民当月节余口粮的办法。这些作法都取得了一定效果，但并未从根本上解决粮票交易和“倒粮”的问题，有的还带来其他负效应。
    目前有人提出变粮价的暗贴为明补，减少六七十年代开始实行的定量标准等建议；还有人提出解决这个问题的根本办法要到粮食购销体制改革的大框架中去找，放开购销这一环。但是各种方案均是牵一发而动全身，都存在着相当的风险。不管怎样，粮票交易问题我们已无法回避，在解决它之前，这个阴影将笼罩着我们，并且会变得越来越大。
