Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 16th.

In the most bustling commercial street in Shenyang City—Taiyuan Street—you can see a white sign with red characters in any shop you enter. The sign prominently displays the office address of the consumer rights protection and complaint reception station.

In early June of this year, the Shenyang Municipal Peace District Administration for Industry and Commerce, Price Bureau, and Metrology Bureau jointly established the first three-in-one office in the city to protect consumer interests on Taiyuan Street. This office has successfully handled over 310 consumer complaints, with a 100% case closure rate. It has been praised by the public as the "guardian of consumers."

    沈阳和平区设消费者举报站  三位一体办案快
    据新华社沈阳11月16日电  （记者张非非）在沈阳市最繁华的商业街——太原街，随便走进哪家商店，都能看见一块白底红字的牌匾，上面醒目地写着维护消费者合法权益举报受理站的办公地址。
    今年6月初，沈阳市和平区工商局、物价局、计量局联合在太原街上成立了全市第一家维护消费者利益的三位一体的办事机构。这个机构目前已圆满处理了310多起群众举报案，结案率达100％，被群众誉为“消费者的卫士”。
