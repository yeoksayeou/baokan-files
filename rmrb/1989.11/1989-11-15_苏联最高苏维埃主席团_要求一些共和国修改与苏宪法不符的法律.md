The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on November 10th demanded that Azerbaijan and three other union republics amend certain legal documents that are inconsistent with the Soviet Constitution.

The meeting pointed out that Azerbaijan, as well as the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, have passed legal documents on issues such as citizenship, voting rights, and the ownership of land and resources that are contrary to the spirit of the Soviet Constitution and international law.

The meeting believed that these actions would undermine the foundation of the Soviet Union and go against the principles of establishing a law-based state. Therefore, these documents are not to be implemented within the republics.

The Supreme Soviet of the USSR on November 12th published a law stipulating that those who disrespect the courts will be held accountable and subject to various penalties.

This law stipulates that anyone who, in any form, interferes with judges and jurors conducting a comprehensive and objective trial, or attempts to influence them to make an illegal judgment, will be sentenced to up to one year of labor re-education or fined 300 to 1000 rubles. If such activities are carried out using official positions, the individual will be deprived of freedom for up to three years or sentenced to one to two years of labor re-education.

The law also stipulates that threatening judges, jurors, and their relatives with murder, violence, or property damage will result in the deprivation of freedom for up to two years or labor re-education for up to two years. If the parties involved refuse to execute the court's judgment or obstruct its execution, they will be fined 300 to 1000 rubles.

Recently, criminal cases in the USSR have been increasing, and the workload of the courts has been growing. However, external interference and influence on judges and jurors have also been increasing. The publication of this law will be beneficial for judges and jurors to conduct independent investigations and judgments. This law will come into effect on December 1st of this year.

According to a report by TASS on November 13th, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR passed the legislative principles of the judicial system of the USSR and the union republics, stipulating that from now on, trials involving the death penalty or a sentence of 15 years will be conducted with a jury.

Another important provision of this legislative document is that lawyers will participate in the case from the beginning of the investigation, whereas previously they could only participate after the investigation was completed. Additionally, in the past, prosecutors could supervise the court's trial process, which limited the court's independence. From now on, prosecutors and defense attorneys will be equal participants in the trial process.

This new legislative document will come into effect on December 1st.

    苏联最高苏维埃主席团
    要求一些共和国修改与苏宪法不符的法律
    新华社莫斯科11月13日电  据苏《消息报》13日报道，苏联最高苏维埃主席团10日开会，要求阿塞拜疆等4个加盟共和国限期修改与苏联宪法不符的某些法律文件。
    会议指出，阿塞拜疆以及波罗的海沿岸的立陶宛、拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚共和国就公民权、选举权、土地和资源所属权等问题，通过了与苏联宪法和国际法的精神相违背的法律文件。
    会议认为，这会动摇苏维埃联盟的基础，与建立法制国家的原则背道而驰。因此，这些文件不得在共和国内实施。
    新华社莫斯科11月12日电  苏联12日公布的一项法律规定，对不尊重法院的行为将追究责任，并课以各种处罚。
      这项法律规定，对以任何形式干预法官和陪审员进行全面和客观的审理、或企图影响他们作出不合法的判决，将处以一年以下的劳动教养或课以300至1000卢布的罚款。如利用公职进行上述活动，将被剥夺三年以下的自由或处以一至两年的劳动教养。
    法律还规定，以企图杀害、暴力或损坏财产威胁法官和陪审员以及他们的亲属，将被剥夺两年以下的自由或处以两年以下的劳动教养。当事人如拒不执行法院判决或阻挠判决的执行，将课以300至1000卢布的罚款。
    近来，苏联的刑事案件不断增加，法院的工作越来越重，而外界对法官和陪审员的干预和影响也越来越多。这项法律的公布将有利于法官和陪审员进行独立的调查和判决。此法律将于今年12月1日起生效。
    新华社莫斯科11月13日电  据塔斯社报道，苏联最高苏维埃13日通过的苏联和加盟共和国司法制度立法原则规定，凡涉及死刑或15年徒刑的判决，今后将实行有陪审的审判。
    这项立法文件的另一重要规定是，律师从侦查工作开始就参与理案，而过去规定在侦查结束后方能参与。此外，过去规定检察员可监督法院审察过程，限制了法院的独立地位；今后检察员同辩护人在诉讼过程中将成为平等的参与者。
    这项新的立法文件将从12月1日起生效。
