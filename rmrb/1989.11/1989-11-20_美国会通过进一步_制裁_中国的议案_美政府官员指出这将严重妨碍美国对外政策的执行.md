The U.S. Congress passed bills in both the House and Senate on November 15 and 16 respectively, imposing further "sanctions" on China. This is another serious step by the U.S. Congress to interfere in China's internal affairs and further deteriorate bilateral relations.

The bill was attached as an amendment to the U.S. State Department Authorization Act. The amendment not only expresses support for the series of "sanctions" announced by the U.S. government on June 5 but also requires the government to suspend funding for activities related to the "Trade Development Office" with China.

The amendment also advocates in its "intentional" statement that the United Nations should "condemn" China, urges the U.S. to "clearly" link its policy towards China with the situation in Tibet, and calls for the U.S. President to "re-examine" China's "Most Favored Nation" status in trade with the U.S. and all bilateral trade agreements. It also calls for coordination with the "COCOM" organization to "re-examine" the preferential treatment given to China in high-tech exports, among other things.

Former U.S. President Nixon recently sent a memorandum to the leaders of both parties in the U.S. Congress, hoping and urging the U.S. administrative and legislative branches to adopt a policy of reconciliation in their policy towards China and to lift the "sanctions" against China.

After the passage of this amendment, U.S. President's National Security Advisor Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Eagleburger jointly wrote a letter to Republican Senator Helms, stating that the new restrictions would "seriously hinder the execution of U.S. foreign policy" and "impose unfair and unreasonable burdens on U.S. diplomatic actions."

The Chinese government and leaders have repeatedly pointed out that the two countries have different social systems and ideologies, and that relations between countries should not be based on imposing one's own social system and values on others. Regardless of their social systems, all countries should handle relations between nations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Violating these principles will inevitably seriously damage bilateral relations.

Note: This amendment stipulates that if the President can report to Congress on progress in China's political reforms or for the sake of U.S. "national interests," the "sanctions" against China can be lifted.

### 美国会通过进一步“制裁”中国的议案  美政府官员指出这将严重妨碍美国对外政策的执行

    美国会通过进一步“制裁”中国的议案
    美政府官员指出这将严重妨碍美国对外政策的执行
    新华社北京11月19日电　美国国会众参两院15日和16日分别通过了对中国采取进一步“制裁”的议案，这是美国国会干涉中国内政、进一步恶化两国关系的又一严重步骤。
    这个议案是以修正案的形式附加在美国国务院授权法案后的。修正案不仅表示支持美国政府6月5日宣布的对中国的一系列“制裁”措施，而且要求政府中止向“贸易发展办公室”与中国有关的活动提供资金。
    这项修正案还在其“意向性”声明中主张由联合国来“谴责”中国，鼓吹美国要“明确地”使其对华政策同西藏的局势相联系，并且要美国总统“重新研究”中国在对美贸易中享有的“最惠国”待遇及所有的双边贸易协定，并协同“巴统”组织“重新研究”在高技术出口方面给予中国的优先待遇等等。（说明）
    美国前总统尼克松日前曾在一份给美国会两党领袖的备忘录中，期望和敦促美行政和立法部门在对华政策方面共同采取和解政策，解除对中国的“制裁”。
    在这项修正案通过后，美国总统国家安全事务助理斯考克罗夫特和副国务卿伊格尔伯格联名写信给共和党参议员赫尔姆斯，指出新的限制措施将“严重妨碍美国对外政策的执行”，并“给美国的外交行动带来不公正的和不合理的负担”。
    中国政府和领导人曾多次指出，中美两国社会制度和意识形态不同，国家之间的关系不应建立在将自己的社会制度和价值观念强加于别国的基础上。各国无论社会制度如何，都应根据和平共处五项原则来处理国与国之间的关系。违背这些原则，必将使两国关系受到严重损害。
    说明：这项修正案规定，如总统能向国会提出报告说明中国在政治改革中取得进展，或出于美国“国家利益”考虑，可撤消对中国的“制裁”措施。
