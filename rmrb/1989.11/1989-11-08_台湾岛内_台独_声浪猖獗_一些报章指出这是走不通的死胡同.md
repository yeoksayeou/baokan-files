	The "Taiwan Independence" wave rages in Taiwan
	Some newspapers point out that this is an impassable dead end

	Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, November 7 - With the intensification of competition in Taiwan's year-end elections, "Taiwan Independence" rhetoric has become rampant, drawing serious attention from the island's citizens and public opinion.

	This year, Taiwan will hold three major elections: "County and City Mayors," "Provincial and Municipal Councilors," and "Additional Legislative Commissioners." Many advocates of "Taiwan Independence" are participating in these elections. In the process of campaigning, they have stirred up the "Taiwan Independence" issue again.

	The New Tide faction within the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) advocates "Taiwan Independence" and claims to establish a "New Country Alliance," putting forward 24 common policy proposals for the so-called "establishment of an Eastern Switzerland Taiwan nation." They demand the drafting of a "new constitution" for Taiwan, the election of a "new parliament," and the establishment of a "new country." Once the taboo on "Taiwan Independence" rhetoric is broken, they will enter the stage of concrete action, planning to propose the "first locally-made new constitution" in mid-November.

	This group has also established the so-called "New Country Movement Headquarters," recently frequently visiting the "Presidential Office" and the "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" to conduct a "Taiwan New Country Renaming Petition Movement," demanding that Lee Teng-hui use Taiwan as the "new national title" to re-enter the international community. DPP legislator Wang Congsong openly proposed in the "Legislative Yuan" to change the "national title" to the "Republic of Democratic Taiwan."

	One of Taiwan's religious forces, the Presbyterian Church, has previously issued statements supporting "Taiwan Independence" three times, and recently openly declared in the "Church Bulletin" that "any candidate supporting the establishment of a new and independent country is a candidate supported by the Presbyterian Church."

	"Taiwan Independence" rhetoric not only appears on election campaign posters on the streets of Taiwan but also on the pages of some major newspapers. The election committees of Kaohsiung County and Yilan County have also allowed the publication of election bulletins on the political views of "new constitutions" and "new countries," and so on. The rampant "Taiwan Independence" wave has drawn the attention of Taiwan's citizens. Many people have stood up to criticize "Taiwan Independence," and some newspapers have published commentaries, pointing out that "Taiwan Independence" is heresy and a delusion, forgetting one's roots. The Taiwan *New Life Daily* published an editorial stating: "Advocating Taiwan independence is a dead-end road that leads nowhere." The *United Daily News* editorial called on: "Everyone should really pay attention to this issue and not pretend it doesn't exist."

    台湾岛内“台独”声浪猖獗
    一些报章指出这是走不通的死胡同
    新华社香港11月7日电  随着台湾年底选举竞争的激烈，“台独”言论猖獗，日益引起岛内民众和舆论的严重关注。
    今年底台湾将举行“县市长”、“省市议员”及“增额立法委员”三项重要选举，有不少鼓吹“台独”的人参与竞选。在为竞选造势中，又炒热了“台独”话题。
    民进党中主张“台独”的新潮流系声称将成立“新国家连线”，推出所谓“建立东方瑞士台湾国”的24条共同政见，叫嚷要推动台湾制定“新宪法”，选举“新国会”，建立“新国家”。一旦“台独”言论禁忌突破之后，他们将进入具体的行动阶段，11月中将提出“第一部本土制新宪法”。
    这伙人还成立所谓“新国家运动本部”，最近频频出招前往“总统府”和“外交部”，进行所谓“台湾新国家正名运动请愿”，要求李登辉以台湾为“新国号”重返国际社会。民进党籍“立委”王聪松公然在“立法院”会中提出更改“国号”为“中华台湾民主国”。
    台湾的宗教势力之一，基督教长老会过去曾先后三次发表声明支持“台独”论调，最近更在《教会公报》上公开声明，“任何支持建立一个新而独立国家的候选人，都是长老教会支持的候选人。”
    “台独”论调不但见诸台湾街头的竞选宣传海报，并登上某些大报的报纸版面。高雄县、宜兰县选举委员会还通过允许“新宪法”、“新国家”的政见刊登在选举公报上，等等。猖獗的“台独”声浪，引起台湾民众的关注。不少人挺身而出，批判“台独”，一些报章也发表评论，指出“台独”是邪说、迷梦，数典忘祖。台湾《新生报》发表社论指出：“主张台湾独立，是一条走不通的死胡同。”台湾《联合报》社论呼吁：“大家实在应该认真地注视这个问题，不能假装没有这回事了。”
