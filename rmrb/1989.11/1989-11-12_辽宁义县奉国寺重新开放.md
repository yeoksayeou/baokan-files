The Deling Temple, a nationally protected key cultural relic, has reopened after undergoing five years of large-scale renovation.

The Deling Temple is located in Yixian County in western Liaoning Province. It was originally built in the ninth year of the Kaityuan era during the Liao Dynasty (AD 1020). The main hall of the temple, known as the Mahavira Hall, stands 21 meters high and covers an area of over 1,800 square meters. It is one of the rare five-ridge single-eave halls in China. The hall houses seven large Buddha statues made during the Liao Dynasty, earning the temple the nickname "Dafosi Temple." Each of these Buddha statues is over 8 meters tall. The central statue, the Pipaishi Buddha, is the largest seated clay Buddha statue in existence in China.
