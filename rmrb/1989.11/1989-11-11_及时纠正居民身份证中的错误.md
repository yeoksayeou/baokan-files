    Correct Errors in Resident ID Cards Promptly

    Recently, I discovered that there are quite a few errors and omissions in resident ID cards. In our unit, which has only about 20 people, five or six individuals have ID cards with mistakes—either the names are incorrect or the photos are mismatched.

    If a citizen holds an ID card with errors or omissions, it is inevitable that the other party will have doubts or misunderstandings when handling specific matters. At the same time, it also causes inconvenience for the verification process, affecting the usability of the ID card for the holder. I suggest strengthening the proofreading and verification work before reprinting ID cards, striving to meet the cardholder in person before reprinting. Additionally, ID cards with errors or omissions should be replaced promptly.

    及时纠正居民身份证中的错误
    最近我发现，居民身份证错漏现象不少。我们这个只有20来人的单位，就有五六个人的身份证不是把姓名搞错了，就是所贴照片张冠李戴。
    如果公民持的是一张有错漏的身份证，在办理一些具体事件时难免使对方产生怀疑、误会；同时也给查验工作带来不便，影响持证人的使用效果。建议加强身份证翻拍前校对核实工作，力争做到身份证翻拍前与本人见面。同时对有错漏的身份证要及时更换。
