The 11th Asian Games, which are of great concern to the people of Asia and are watched closely by the world, will open in just over 300 days. This is the first major international comprehensive sports event held in New China since its founding 40 years ago. We are determined and confident to make this Asian Games a success.

Holding the 11th Asian Games in our great capital, Beijing, has important practical significance and far-reaching influence. It will further promote friendly exchanges between the Chinese people and the people of Asia and the world, raise the level of Asian sports, and will certainly boost our national spirit, promote reform and opening up, and advance economic construction, urban construction management, and the building of socialist spiritual civilization.

The Party and the state attach great importance to successfully hosting the 11th Asian Games. Comrade Deng Xiaoping, who is 85 years old, personally participated in the voluntary tree-planting labor at the Asian Games Village. General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng recently inspected the Asian Games venues and demanded that all parties work together to build the Asian Games projects well and successfully host the Asian Games, to bring glory to Beijing and to the motherland. Chairman Yang Shangkun, when meeting with the President of the Olympic Council of Asia, Fahd, said that the situation in Beijing is stable, and so is the situation in China. There are fully sufficient conditions to successfully host the Asian Games. Beijing's hosting of the Asian Games has also received widespread support internationally. President Fahd said: The Olympic Council of Asia is very satisfied and pleased with the preparations for the 11th Asian Games. This sports event will definitely be a success. The President of the International Olympic Committee, Samaranch, also expressed: The International Olympic Committee fully supports the 11th Asian Games to be held in Beijing next year and believes that this sports event will definitely be successful.

Since its establishment in May 1985, the Organizing Committee of the 11th Asian Games has done a great deal of preparatory work. With the support and help of the central government, various provinces and cities across the country, and overseas friends, tens of thousands of workers have worked tirelessly. So far, out of the 31 newly built and renovated venues (excluding two water venues), 20 have been completed, with 15 already in use. By the end of this year, 7 more will be completed; by the end of May next year, the remaining 4 venues will all be completed. The Asian Games Village, municipal engineering, electronic services, and other projects are also under construction and will be completed and put into use between June and July next year. Asian friends are satisfied with these newly built venues. According to the overall planning requirements of Beijing, these venues are medium and small-sized, multi-functional, and distributed in various districts of Beijing or universities, with long-term use value. After the Asian Games, they can not only serve various competitions, training, and school sports activities but also screen films and hold art performances. All venues will be open to the public, especially with preferential treatment for primary and secondary school students.

Hosting the Asian Games is a glory for Beijing and also a glory for our motherland. All parts of the country have already and will continue to support the Asian Games in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. We must further mobilize the workers of all trades and industries in Beijing and the broad masses of the people, starting from ourselves and starting from now, to strive to significantly improve the level of social morality and etiquette in the capital, improve social customs, keep the urban environment clean and beautiful, ensure safe and smooth traffic, maintain social stability, maintain good order in the venues, and significantly improve service quality, creating a new situation in the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, and making the 11th Asian Games a grand event of "unity, friendship, and progress."

    亚运会正向我们走来
    第十一届亚运会组委会常务副主席、北京市常务副市长张百发
    为亚洲人民关注、世界人民瞩目的第十一届亚运会，离开幕只有三百多天了。这是新中国成立四十年来首次举办的大型国际综合体育盛会，我们有决心、有信心把这届亚运会办好。
    在我们伟大祖国首都——北京举办亚运会，有着重要的现实意义和深远影响。它将进一步发展我国人民同亚洲和世界人民的友好交往，提高亚洲体育的水平，也必将振奋我们的民族精神，促进改革、开放，推进经济建设、城市建设管理和社会主义精神文明建设。
    党和国家对办好第十一届亚运会十分关怀重视。85岁高龄的邓小平同志亲自参加亚运村的义务植树劳动。江泽民总书记、李鹏总理最近先后视察了亚运会场馆，要求各方面通力协作，把亚运会工程建设好，把亚运会举办好，为北京争光，为祖国争光。杨尚昆主席在会见亚奥理事会主席法赫德时表示，北京的局势是稳定的，中国的局势也是稳定的。开好亚运会完全具备条件。北京承办亚运会，在国际上也得到了广泛支持。法赫德主席说：亚奥理事会对第十一届亚运会的准备工作感到十分满意和高兴。这个运动会肯定会是成功的。国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇也表示：国际奥委会全力支持明年在北京举行的第十一届亚洲运动会，相信这次运动会一定会取得成功。
    第十一届亚运会组委会自1985年5月成立以来，做了大量的筹备工作。在中央、全国各地和海外朋友的支持、帮助下，数万工人艰苦奋战，到目前为止，新建改建的31个场馆（不包括两个水上场馆），已经有20个建成，其中15个陆续使用。到今年底，还将有7个完工；明年5月底，其余4个场馆将全部建成。亚运村工程、市政工程、电子服务等工程，也在加紧施工，明年6—7月间全部建成并投入使用。亚洲朋友对这些新建场馆表示满意。根据北京市总体规划要求，这些场馆都是中小型、多功能的，分布在北京各区或大学，有长远的使用价值。亚运会后，它们不仅可以为各项比赛、训练和学校体育活动提供服务，还可以放电影，举办文艺演出等。所有场馆都将对社会开放，尤其要优惠照顾中小学生。
    办好亚运会是北京的光荣，也是我们祖国的光荣。全国各地已经并将继续从人力、物力、财力等方面热情支持亚运会。我们要进一步动员北京市各行各业职工及广大市民，人人从我做起，从现在做起，努力使首都的社会公德、文明礼貌水平明显提高，社会风气好转，市容环境整洁、美观，交通安全畅通，社会治安稳定，场馆秩序良好，服务质量明显改观，开创社会主义精神文明建设的新局面，把第十一届亚运会办成“团结、友谊、进步”的盛会。
