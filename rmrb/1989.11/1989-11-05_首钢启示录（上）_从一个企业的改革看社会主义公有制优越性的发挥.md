Editor's Note: The successful reform experiences of the Capital Iron and Steel Corporation have been reported numerous times in newspapers. This article, however, focuses on observing and contemplating the ten-year reform of Shougang from the perspective of the superiority of socialist public ownership. How do we understand the contract responsibility system? How can enterprise reforms be deepened? How can the overall reform thinking be further clarified? Why must the two fundamental points be unified? On these issues, people may gain some insights.

The historical challenge posed to socialist public ownership is serious: During the revolutionary war years, countless martyrs sacrificed their lives for its realization; in the 1950s, the Chinese people celebrated its nationwide coverage with drums and songs; and in the 1980s, when reforms truly unleashed its superiority, the clouds of doubt from within and abroad cast a shadow over it.

There is such a large enterprise whose ten-year reform achievements are like a strong and bright beam of light, piercing through the fog and illuminating the fields of thought.

The Capital Steel City is sparkling with inspirational sparks.

Shougang — Fearless of Comparison

When discussing the ten-year reform of the Capital Iron and Steel Corporation, the most striking figures are:

In ten years, 7 billion yuan was remitted to the state, 2.6 billion yuan of new fixed assets were added, and a total of 9.6 billion yuan was contributed to the state, equivalent to ten years of growth of nine Shougangs. In the previous thirty years, the corresponding figures were 3.2 billion yuan. One year of reform is equal to ten years before the reform.

Perhaps this is still the familiar "self-comparison" of "vertical comparison." Well, let's compare it on the international stage:

Shougang's net value-added labor productivity in 1988 was $18,300 per person-year, an increase of 2.6 times over ten years ago. During the same period, British Steel increased by 1.8 times, U.S. Steel increased by 1.6 times, Bhilai Steel increased by 1.26 times, Krupp increased by 38%, Nippon Steel increased by 28%, and Mannesmann Company (West Germany) increased by 2%.

This is the speed; I want to see the actual level! Well, here it is: The French Usinor Company is $18,000 per person-year, the West German Krupp Company is $17,000 per person-year, British Steel is $16,800 per person-year, South African Iron and Steel is $9,500 per person-year, and Shougang is higher than all of them. American steel companies generally engage in diversified operations, and the comparability is not high. The five major steel companies in Japan have large-scale equipment, and their labor productivity is higher than Shougang's.

"Shougang is not afraid of horizontal comparison!" — Shougang's comrades first nodded, then shook their heads: "Our workers' wages can't be compared with theirs."

In any case, Shougang has the right to participate in the international "Olympics." Considering that it has only walked the socialist path for 40 years and has only reformed for 10 years, this "athlete" has shown a vigorous spirit, at least enough to remove the hat of "public ownership enterprises must have low efficiency."

The chairman of the Capital Iron and Steel Corporation, Zhou Guanwu, said: "I don't believe that socialism can't beat capitalism!"

This is a great "mystery"

In the early days of the contract responsibility system, a central leader asked Zhou Guanwu: "How much potential does the enterprise have?" He replied: "I can't figure it out."

The State Planning Commission sent Li Renjun to investigate. He reviewed the materials, listened to the reports, and observed the front line at night, and came to the same conclusion: He couldn't figure out how much potential Shougang had.

Today, several Shougang leaders still say: The potential of the enterprise is a "mystery."

Look, the first steelmaking plant, with a designed capacity of 600,000 tons, now produces 2.22 million tons annually. Who could have imagined this before? A Soviet leader visited and listened to the introduction, insisting that the figures were wrong. Upon arriving at the scene, he calculated and nodded in acknowledgment of the "steel" fact.

The small rolling mill, with a designed capacity of 300,000 tons, will reach nearly three times the designed capacity this year.

In 1984, Shougang decided to implement comprehensive electronic computer management, with only 8 professional personnel. Who could have imagined that in less than three years, they would accomplish it?

The acquired strip mill, in seven years, had an annual profit growth rate of 31.65%, and even they themselves said, "We couldn't have imagined it before!"

In the past ten years, Shougang has obtained 36 technical patents, including two top-burning hot blast furnaces and high-furnace coal injection, which have been transferred to developed countries.

In 1988, Shougang acquired 70% of the shares of the American Masstec Engineering Company.

There is another "secret" potential: It can now produce equipment for a steel enterprise with an annual output of 5 million tons of steel, fully automated...

These numerous "unexpected" and "unfathomable" things form a great "mystery" — the mystery of the potential of socialist public ownership. Within our vision, some public ownership enterprises are simply "beyond redemption," while others are surprisingly delightful! Some people are bewildered and confused by this "mystery" and ultimately seek it in vain. Shougang's approach is to use the contract responsibility system to persist in public ownership and break through the old system. They do not doubt or even "replace" socialist public ownership, but rather use the method of reforming the old system to increasingly clearly reveal the bottom of this great mystery.

China's reform is essentially about solving this great "mystery"!

The Formula of Public Ownership

Shougang's contract responsibility system and its details are a series of "magnum opuses" totaling millions of words. But its core is nothing more than a few indicators:

Annual remittance of profits increased by 7.2%;
Annual realization of profits increased by 20%;
Enterprise retained profits are distributed in a 6:2:2 ratio — 60% for enterprise expansion and reproduction, 20% for increasing wages and bonuses, and 20% for collective welfare.
The company's total wage bill is linked to realized profits at a ratio of 0.8:1.

This set of numbers is well-known in Shougang. Sociologist Fei Xiaotong found in a random sampling survey that 97% of workers could accurately answer the above indicators. Not only can they "answer," but they can also "calculate" from these indicators to derive the "ratio" between the factory, workshop, team, and individual completing tasks and obtaining remuneration.

You will find that a great force is generated from this ordinary and mysterious derivation. The rolling worker Zhang Sanyang struggles to save half a second in every operation; the worker Yan Guangtong submits 8 rationalization suggestions a year, 6 of which are adopted; "form filling" and "ratio" have become terms with special meanings. When the reporter mentioned them in a curious tone, a worker seriously corrected him, saying, "Here, anyone who violates discipline and operating procedures must fill out a form, and all monthly bonuses will be deducted, affecting the 'ratio,' affecting promotion, affecting the team and workshop." Everything is tied together.

Through those regulations that unify rights, responsibilities, and interests, and the specific and dizzying calculations of the package, guarantee, and audit, we only need to delve a little deeper to discover that the principle contained within is extremely simple: the unity of the interests of the state, the enterprise, and the individual.

Isn't this the phrase that has been said too many times, written too many times, and used too many times? Yes. The unity of the interests of the three parties, in the past, people only regarded it as a distribution policy, and distribution was regarded as a secondary issue below production. Today, it is to be elevated to the level of the embodiment of socialist public ownership.

The relationship between ownership and distribution is two sides of the same coin. The ownership of the means of production determines how material interests are distributed; but "ownership" is not only for "distribution," but must also be reflected in distribution. Without the corresponding distribution relationship, the "ownership" relationship will also be empty.

Under the principle of distribution according to labor, the unity of the interests of the three parties is not only determined by socialist public ownership but is also its embodiment of superiority. Because it eliminates the conflict of interests between society, the enterprise, and the individual generated by private ownership, because it eliminates the suppression of laborers' enthusiasm and becomes the greatest obstacle to the development of productive forces — exploitation.

Shougang people proudly say that in our place, the reform has implemented the principle of material interests, but has not induced the tendency of "everything for money." The fundamental reason is that the contract responsibility system has integrated labor for the individual with labor for the state and the enterprise. Excessive contributions are not put into anyone's pocket, but are for the state and the enterprise, which arouses people's noble sense of mission.

We have reason to point to socialist public ownership and say: There is "atomic energy" here! Reform is to release its unique energy according to the formula of the unity of the interests of the three parties. So complex, yet so simple.

"The Enterprise Seeking Owners"

At the beginning of the contract responsibility system, Comrade Wanli told Zhou Guanwu: "We have delegated power, but not to you, Zhou Guanwu, but to all the employees of Shougang!"

When introducing the situation to outsiders, Shougang leaders always emphasize: "We are all-employee contracting!"

This is not just a phrase; it is the essence. The owners of public ownership enterprises have long been sought.

"The Communist Party pursues public ownership, but in the past, there were problems with its understanding. Public ownership is the economy of the majority, and its superiority lies in this. But under the old system, it became the economy of a few people." Deputy Secretary of the Shougang Party Committee, Zhao Yujie, made such an interpretation.

"Public ownership is a process of realization. During the Cultural Revolution, Zhang Chunqiao said, 'Send a military representative, and the nature of ownership will change.' In fact, it is not that simple." Xu Xi, known as the "theorist of Shougang," put forward such a view.

"In the early days of the founding of the nation, due to the needs of economic and political struggles, it was necessary to adopt a centralized economic system. But it was not timely reversed. Public ownership is not that people don't care, but that a good system needs to be established to make people care." This is Zhou Guanwu's historical analysis.

Unlike some enterprises, since the reform, Shougang workers have not felt a loss of their status as masters, but rather an "enhancement." Why is this? At a symposium, workers and team leaders from the front line immediately came up with five points:

The first point is that the unity of the interests of the three parties makes the enterprise a "community of interests" or "community of fate" for the employees. Sharing the same fate naturally gives rise to the sense of being the master.

The second point is that the congress of worker representatives elected by all employees is the highest authority of the company. The factory committee is its standing body. Worker Sun Tie is a member of this committee. At the symposium, it was asked: "Do you have real speaking rights?" Sun Tie answered: "Whenever important decisions are made, they often seek my opinion first and ask me to reflect the views of the workers."

The third point is that major company matters are widely publicized every week through the "Situation Bulletin." Each management department of the company has information officers at the grassroots level to timely understand the opinions of the workers. All of this is to absorb workers' participation in daily management.

The fourth point is that the supervisory committees and supervisory groups established by the company and factories are powerful institutions for workers to supervise cadres. The "Shougang Daily" published a piece of news: "Workers and cadres sue each other, and workers win — Record of the first workers' trial held by the supervisory group of the casting plant"...

The fifth point is that the life management committee elected by the employees is responsible for managing the collective welfare of the employees, and the 20% of the enterprise's retained profits are fully decided by it, and the general manager has no right to interfere.

Shougang is naturally not a utopia. Incompatibilities of adaptation, understanding, and coordination are not uncommon; occasional incidents of workers threatening their superiors with knives and jumping off buildings also occur. But the main melody of "we are the masters of the enterprise" is becoming increasingly prominent. Thus, on the surface, two seemingly opposing aspects are developing simultaneously: on the one hand, the continuous improvement and strengthening of rules and regulations and organizational discipline; on the other hand, the continuous progress of human liberation and improvement. Theoretical and technical training is carried out year-round. The title of "Shougang worker" breaks the boundary between workers and staff, workers can become cadres, and cadres can become workers, both are liberation. Technological progress has become the need of the masses, and the value of intellectuals has also been commonly recognized. "Last night I had a fight with my wife, and as soon as I got on the platform, I forgot about it!" The worker's words reveal their work mood...

The propaganda department of the company party committee, Yu Guirong, said that now we are not just advocating the mobilization of workers' enthusiasm, but the issue of giving full play to their creativity. She believes that the liberation of Shougang people has reached this level.

For the people, relying on the people, and liberating the people, this is another basic characteristic and superiority of the socialist public ownership economy. Shougang's contracting is based on realistic conditions, finding the owners for the enterprise. It is also from here that they discovered the solid growth point where democracy and science are married, and the creation of things and the liberation of people go hand in hand.

    首钢启示录（上）
    ——从一个企业的改革看社会主义公有制优越性的发挥
    本报记者　艾丰
    编者按：首都钢铁公司改革的成功经验，报纸已经报道过多次。本文则是着重从社会主义公有制优越性的角度观察思考首钢十年改革。怎样理解承包制？企业改革如何深化？整个改革思路怎样进一步廓清？两个基本点为什么必须统一？在这些问题上，人们或许可以从中获得启示。
    历史对社会主义公有制提出的考题，是严肃的：革命战争年代，无数先烈为了它的实现而抛头颅、洒热血；50年代，中国人民为了它覆盖全国而敲锣打鼓扭秧歌；到了80年代，正当改革真正释放出它的优越性的时候，海内外飘来的乌云却给它罩上了阴影。
    有这样一个大企业，它10年改革的成绩，犹如一缕强劲而明亮的光束，穿透迷雾，投射到思维的田野。
    首都钢城，闪亮着启示火花。
    首钢——不怕横比
    讲首都钢铁公司10年改革，给人印象最深的是这样的数字：
    10年，上交国家70亿元，新增固定资产26亿元，共为国家贡献96亿元，相当于10年增殖了9个首钢。这以前的30年，相应的数字是32亿元。改革中的1年等于改革前的10年。
    或许说，这还是惯用的“自己同自己”的“纵比”，那好，把它放到国际大赛场上去“横比”一番：
    首钢1988年净增值全员劳动生产率为1.83万美元／人年，比10年前提高2.6倍。同期，英钢联提高1.8倍，美钢联提高1.6倍，川琦制铁提高1.26倍，克虏勃提高38％，新日铁提高28％，曼内斯曼公司（联邦德国）提高2％。
    这是速度，我要看实在的水平！那好：法国西洛尔公司为1.80万美元／人年，联邦德国克洛克纳公司为1.70万美元／人年，英钢联为1.68万美元／人年，南非钢铁公司为0.95万美元／人年，首钢高于它们。美国钢铁企业大都搞多种经营，可比性不大。日本五大钢铁公司设备大型化，劳动生产率高于首钢。
    “首钢不怕横比！”——对这个评价，首钢的同志先是点头，后又摇头：“我们工人的工资没法跟人家比。”
    无论如何，首钢总是有资格参加国际“奥林匹克”了。考虑到它在社会主义道路上才走了40年，改革只有10年，这位“选手”所显示的虎虎生气，起码可以摘掉“公有制企业必定低效率”的帽子了。
    首都钢铁公司董事长周冠五说：“我就不相信社会主义干不过资本主义！”
    这是一个伟大的“谜”
    承包初期，中央领导问周冠五：“企业潜力有多大？”他回答：“吃不透。”
    国家计委派李仁俊来调查，他看材料，听汇报，深夜下第一线观察，同样结论：说不清首钢有多大潜力。
    今天，几位首钢领导者仍是这个说法：企业的潜力是一个“谜”。
    你看，第一炼钢厂，设计能力60万吨，现在搞到年产222万吨，以前谁想得到？苏联一位领导人参观，听介绍，一口咬定数字算错了，到现场一看，一算，点头承认了这“钢”的事实。
    小型轧钢厂设计能力30万吨，今年产量也可达到设计能力的近3倍。
    1984年，首钢决定实行全面电子计算机管理时，专业人员只有8名，谁能想象，干了不到3年，也拿下来了。
    兼并过来的带钢厂，7年时间，利润年递增率竟达31.65％，连他们自己也说，“以前不敢想象”！
    10年来，首钢共获技术专利36项，其中顶燃式热风炉、高炉喷煤两项已向发达国家转让。
    1988年，首钢购买了美国麦斯塔工程公司70％股份。
    还有一个“秘密”潜力：它已可以制造年产500万吨钢、全部自动化的钢铁企业设备……
    这众多的“想不到”和“吃不透”所组成的乃是一个伟大的“谜”——社会主义公有制潜力之谜。在我们的视野之内，有的公有制企业简直“不可救药”，而有的公有制企业却令人惊喜！有的人围绕这个“谜”彷徨、困惑，终因不得要领而思它求。首钢所做的，是用承包制这把钥匙坚持公有制，突破旧体制。他们不是怀疑以至“换掉”社会主义公有制，而是用改革旧体制的办法，日益清晰地揭示着这个伟大之谜的谜底。
    中国的改革，实质上就是解开这个伟大的“谜”！
    公有制的推导公式
    首钢承包制及其细目，是数百万字的系列“巨著”。但它的核心，无非是这样几个指标：
    每年上交利润递增7.2％；
    每年实现利润递增20％；
    企业留利按6∶2∶2分配——6成用于企业扩大再生产，2成用于提高工资、奖金，2成用于集体福利。
    公司工资总额与实现利润按0.8∶1挂钩。
    这组数字，在首钢家喻户晓。社会学家费孝通在一次随机抽样调查中，发现97％的工人都可以准确回答上述指标。不仅能够“答出”，他们还会“算出”，凭这些指标组成的“公式”，人们可以推导出工厂、车间、班组、个人完成任务和取得报酬之间的“挂率”。
    你会发现，一股巨大的力量正是从这种普通而奥妙的推导中迸发出来。轧钢工人张三洋为在每个操作动作中节省半秒钟而苦思最佳操作法；工人阎广忠一年提8项合理化建议，6项被采用；“填表”、“挂率”成了特殊含义的名词。当记者以好奇的口吻提到它们的时候，一位工人严肃地纠正说，我们这里凡违犯纪律和操作规程者，都要填表，一律扣当月全部奖金，还要影响“挂率”，影响升级，影响班组、车间。全都捆到一块儿了。
　　透过那些权、责、利统一，包、保、核结合的规定和具体的令人眼花缭乱的计算，我们只要稍微深入研究一下，就会发现，这里面所包含的原来是个极其简单的原理：国家、企业、个人三者利益的一致。
    这不是说滥了、写滥了、用滥了的那句话吗？是的。三者利益一致，过去人们只把它当成分配政策，而分配又被看成是低于生产的次等问题。今天，则要把它提高到社会主义公有制的体现来看待了。
    所有制和分配关系，是一个硬币的两面。生产资料归谁所有决定着物质利益如何分配；但是，“所有”不仅是为了“分配”，而且必须体现在分配上。没有相应的分配关系，“所有”关系也会架空。
    在按劳分配基础上实现的三者利益一致，不仅是社会主义公有制决定的，而且正是它优越性的体现。因为它消除了社会、企业、个人之间由私有制产生的利益对抗的动因，因为它消除了对劳动者积极性形成压抑并成为生产力发展的最大障碍——剥削。
    首钢人骄傲地说，在我们这里改革落实了物质利益原则，却没有诱发“一切向钱看”的思想倾向。基础原因，就是承包制把为个人的劳动同为国家、为企业的劳动融合起来了。超额的奉献，不是归入哪个人的腰包，而是为国家，为企业，这就唤起了人们崇高的事业心。
    我们有理由指着社会主义公有制说：这里有“原子能”！改革，就是要按照三者利益一致的公式，把它特有的能量释放出来。如此复杂，又如此简单。
    “寻求主人”的企业
    承包之初，万里同志对周冠五说：“我们放权了，但不是放给你周冠五的，是放给首钢全体职工的！”
    首钢领导者向外人介绍情况时总是强调：“我们是全员承包！”
    这不是措词，而是实质。公有制企业的主人，长期在寻求之中。
    “共产党人追求公有制，但过去对它的理解有问题。公有制是多数人的经济，它的优越性在此。但旧体制下搞成了少数人的经济。”首钢党委副书记赵玉洁作如此阐述。
    “公有制是个实现的过程。‘文革’时期张春桥说，‘派个军代表，所有制性质就变了’。其实没有那么简单。”被称为“首钢理论家”的徐晞前提出这样的观点。
    “建国初期，出于经济、政治斗争的需要，采取权力集中的经济体制是必要的。但后来没有及时扭转。公有制不是大家不关心，而是要建立好体制让大家关心。”这是周冠五的历史分析。
    与一些企业发生的情况相反，改革以来，首钢工人没有产生什么主人翁地位的失落感，而是“增强感”。为什么会是这样？在一次座谈会上，来自第一线的工人、班组长，即席就凑了这样五条：
    第一条，三者利益一致，企业是职工的“利益共同体”或“命运共同体”。命运与共，自然产生主人之感。
    第二条，全体职工选举产生的职工代表大会是公司的最高权力机关。工厂委员会是它的常设机构。工人孙铁是这个委员会的委员。座谈会上问：“你有真正的发言权吗？”孙铁答：“凡作出重要决定，常常先征求我的意见，要我反映工人的看法。”
    第三条，公司大事，每周有《情况通报》广而告之。公司各主管部门在基层都有信息员，及时了解工人意见。这都是为了吸收工人参与日常管理。
    第四条，公司、工厂分别设立的监察委员会、监察小组，是工人监督干部的强有力机构。《首钢报》刊载过这样一条消息：“工人和干部打官司，工人打赢了——记铸造厂监察小组召开第一次职工审理会”……
    第五条，职工选举产生的生活管理委员会，负责管理职工集体福利事业，企业留利中20％的那项资金如何使用，由它全权决定，总经理也无权干涉。
    首钢自然也不是世外桃源。不适应、不理解、不协调的纠葛，并不少见；工人以菜刀和跳楼威胁顶头上司的插曲也偶有发生。但“我们是企业主人翁”的主旋律越来越高扬。于是，表面看来是对立着的两个方面同时发展：一方面是规章制度、组织纪律的不断完善和加强；一方面是人的解放、人的提高不断得到进展。理论和技术的培训，常年坚持。“首钢工作者”这一称号的提出，打破了工人和职员的界限，工人可以成为干部，干部可以成为工人，两者都是解放。科技进步成了众人的需要，知识分子的价值也就获得了共同的承认。“昨天晚上和老婆打了一架，一上平台全忘了！”工人这句话，道出了他们的劳动心情……公司党委宣传部部长余桂英说，现在我们宣扬的不仅是调动工人积极性，而是发挥创造性的问题。她认为，首钢人的解放已到了这个层次。
    为人民，靠人民，解放人民，这是社会主义公有制经济又一基本特征和优越之处。首钢承包正是从现实条件出发，为企业“寻求”到了主人。也正是从这里，他们发现了民主和科学联姻，物的创造同人的解放携手的扎扎实实的生长点。
