The final match for the eleventh New Sports Cup Go Championship between the reigning champion Plier Wei-ping, a 9th Dan, and challenger Yu Bin, an 8th Dan, was held in Huaiyang, Jiangsu Province on November 9th and 13th. Plier Wei-ping won the first two games, taking a temporary lead.

In the first game, Plier Wei-ping played black and started with a star-small corner formation. Yu Bin countered with a double-small corner. During the middle of the opening stage, Yu Bin prematurely initiated a fight within Plier Wei-ping's large formation, resulting in significant losses due to a lack of effective fighting resources. The game's momentum shifted, and Yu Bin conceded defeat after 129 moves. In the second game, Yu Bin played black and started with a Chinese-style opening, aggressively launching an offensive that kept the game in a chaotic state. Plier Wei-ping, with his exquisite endgame skills, gradually neutralized Yu Bin's advantage, ultimately winning by 1.25 points.

The New Sports Cup final follows a best-of-five format. The remaining games will be held in Beijing in late November.

    新体育杯围棋决赛聂卫平先胜两局
    本报讯　第十一届新体育杯围棋赛冠亚军决赛已于本月9日和13日在江苏省淮阳市进行。上届冠军聂卫平九段连胜挑战者俞斌八段两局，暂时领先。
    在第一局比赛中，聂卫平执黑先行，布下星小目阵势，俞斌则以双小目对抗。在序盘战中期，俞斌过早地在黑棋的大阵势中挑起劫争，结果因找不到有效的劫材而造成很大的损失，局势就此一蹶不振。双方弈至第一百二十九手，俞斌投子认输。第二局俞斌执黑以中国流布局起首，积极主动地展开了攻势，使局势始终处于混沌状态。聂卫平靠精湛的收官技巧，星星点点地化解了俞斌的先行效力，最后以一又四分之一子又下一城。
    新体育杯决赛采用五局三胜制，第三局以后的比赛将于11月下旬在北京继续进行。　（程晓流）
