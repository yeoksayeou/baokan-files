Shanghai, the largest commercial and industrial city in China, began using a uniform 7-digit telephone numbering system at 00:02 on November 12. The 6-digit telephone numbering system, which has been in use for 32 years, was simultaneously discontinued.

General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Jiang Zemin, was pleased to learn that Shanghai is the first city in the country to implement a uniform 7-digit telephone numbering system. He sent a letter of congratulations to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Posts and Telecommunications.

At 23:58 on November 11, Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji issued the approval order for the switch. With the command from Xu Zhigao, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Posts and Telecommunications and the overall commander of the switch project, the 95 telephone exchanges, 75 machine rooms, and nearly 500,000 telephone lines across the city were quickly switched and connected. At 00:02 on November 12, the switch was successfully completed in one go. This marks the beginning of a new chapter in Shanghai's telecommunications industry.
