According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, between 1979 and 1987, the country lost 52.51 million mu of arable land. Of this, 24 million mu were lost in just the two years between 1985 and 1986, equivalent to the arable land area of 36 medium-sized counties. Meanwhile, wastewater from industry and township enterprises has also polluted a significant amount of arable land. The population is increasing, but arable land is decreasing. This is a major issue that we must address seriously. How can we protect the quantity of arable land?

We must strictly prohibit the encroachment of arable land: Currently, the waste of arable land in the construction of factories and township enterprises is very serious. Many places take more land than they use, and sometimes they take land without using it at all. Why must farmers build new houses on fertile farmland instead of on idle land or hillsides? Some provinces are blindly building expressways or expanding road surfaces, which is worth considering whether it is in line with the national conditions. In some places, farmers do not use natural water bodies for aquaculture but instead dig up fertile fields to create fish ponds. In 1985, during a survey in Wuxi, Jiangsu, it was reported that 500,000 mu of rice fields were dug up to create fish ponds in just one year. Additionally, the development of open-pit mines without restoring the topsoil, and the use of farmland soil to burn bricks and tiles, all encroach upon a certain amount of arable land.

The construction of reservoirs must undergo multidisciplinary reviews: Since liberation, countless large, medium, and small reservoirs have been built nationwide, which are necessary for power generation and irrigation. However, some have been built blindly. For example, during the "Great Leap Forward" in the Linyi region of Shandong, over 1,000 large, medium, and small reservoirs were built. One large reservoir flooded 100,000 mu of fertile land, and after 30 years of matching facilities, it could only irrigate 60,000 mu of farmland. The income from power generation was not enough to cover the operating costs of the power station, resulting in a loss. This is just one typical example. There are similar situations in other places.

Control water and soil erosion: In recent years, due to the indiscriminate felling of forests and steep slope cultivation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the water conservation, flood control, and water regulation functions of the forests have been lost. This resulted in the severe floods in Sichuan in 1981 and caused the Dujiangyan Irrigation System, which has nourished the Chengdu Plain for thousands of years, to experience a drought period with water shortages. The Wujian Duo Water Power Station, a major power station in Guizhou, had its reservoir silted up to the level originally planned for a century after only 9 years of operation, threatening the lifespan of the reservoir. Currently, water and soil erosion in the entire Yangtze River basin accounts for one-third of the total area, with 2.24 billion tons of soil lost annually, equivalent to losing 8.3 million mu of arable land at a depth of 30 cm each year. In the Loess Plateau of Northwest China, due to deforestation, overgrazing, cultivation, firewood collection, and overgrazing, water and soil erosion account for 80% of the basin area. The Yellow River has a sediment concentration of over 37 kg per cubic meter, causing the storage capacity of seven major reservoirs to be reduced by 40%, with the most severely affected reservoirs reduced by 75%. Currently, about one-third of the reservoirs in the entire basin have been abandoned. Preventing water and soil erosion requires strict prohibition of steep slope cultivation in the upper reaches of rivers, protection of natural vegetation, and necessary engineering measures.

Prevent desertification of arable land: In the arid desert regions of Northwest China, the Taklamakan Desert in the South is a vast area of shifting sand dunes. Its edges were originally covered with red willow and white thorn bushes, which served as the first line of defense for the oases. However, during the "Great Leap Forward," the slogan "Cut down all the red willow bushes to awaken the sleeping earth" led to the cultivation of these "sand bushes" into farmland, resulting in shifting sands that not only cannot be cultivated but also bury farmland, forcing farmers to relocate. In the North, the Junggar Basin was originally covered with white saxaul and saxaul shrubs that fixed and semi-fixed sand dunes. The vegetation on the fixed sand dunes was cut down for fuel, leading to the burial of newly built oasis farmland and villages by sandstorms. In the spring, strong winds caused the death of large numbers of livestock during migration. In semi-arid grassland regions, over-cultivation, overgrazing, and excessive digging of medicinal herbs have led to land desertification. To prevent desertification, in addition to protecting natural vegetation, irrigation canals should be lined with narrow strips of agricultural protective forests. In the coastal areas of Southeast China, every year, strong winds and typhoons cause damage to farmland, aquaculture ponds, reservoirs, and transportation facilities. In the Qing Dynasty, Pingtan County in Fujian experienced a severe disaster where "one night of sand buried eighteen villages." Therefore, it is urgent to accelerate the construction of coastal protective forests to form a true "Green Great Wall."

Prevent secondary salinization of arable land: The soils of the Northeast Plain, the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, and the oases in the arid regions of Northwest China are all threatened by varying degrees of secondary salinization. Many low-yielding fields are formed due to soil salinization. In Xinjiang, 30% of the 47 million mu of arable land is affected by salinization, and the problem is still expanding, especially in the South. In the South, due to the irrational construction of many plain reservoirs, the high salt content in the underlying soil is brought to the surface through capillary action as the groundwater level rises, causing 70% of the arable land to experience secondary salinization. Additionally, farmland is left fallow without proper management, which also promotes surface salinization. Preventing soil salinization mainly involves avoiding excessive irrigation, ensuring proper drainage, and planning the abandonment or renovation of some harmful plain reservoirs in the Northwest. How can we protect the quality of arable land?

Prevent industrial, especially township industrial, pollution: Currently, industrial, especially township industrial, pollution of arable land is very serious. In 1986, I investigated a village in Changyi County, Shandong Province. The village is located near the Yushan River. Due to the industrial wastewater from factories in Weifang City and township enterprises in the county, such as dyeing, electroplating, leather, and small papermaking factories, the Yushan River, which was clear in the 1970s, has now become a sewage pit. Industrial waste and garbage are either dumped into the river or washed into it by rainwater. In the 1970s, this village was a famous "land of fish and rice" in Shandong, but now due to water pollution of the Yushan River and farmland, not only have fish and shrimp disappeared, and lotus cannot be grown, but even grain can only be grown by using water from wells 30-40 meters deep to irrigate the fields. However, the well water is also polluted, and the grain grown has an unusual smell. The seriousness of industrial wastewater pollution of arable land without treatment is a widespread problem nationwide.

Transform small-scale mining into modern mining: In the southern part of Sichuan Province, the production of sulfur involves releasing 1 ton of sulfur into the atmosphere for every ton of sulfur produced, wasting mineral resources, harming human health, and releasing a large amount of high-concentration sulfur compounds into the atmosphere, destroying nearby vegetation, and making the land barren and uncultivable. In a certain county in Sichuan, 500 tons of tung trees originally produced have basically died due to sulfur pollution. In Xinghe County, Inner Mongolia, the 13 graphite mines in Dianzi Township and Nanwan Township discharge waste water and waste oil containing harmful compounds such as aluminum oxide and blackish-yellow smelly oil, polluting more than 10,000 mu of nearby farmland. Most of the arable land is polluted by oil, making it impossible to grow crops in the spring, completely losing its arable value. The grain produced from these polluted farmlands naturally harms human health through the food chain.

View the issue of agricultural "chemicalization" correctly: Currently, all aspects emphasize that agricultural input is correct, but it is not enough to only promote the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic films. Chemical fertilizers are indeed necessary, but neglecting organic fertilizers leads to a lack of comprehensive nutrients and organic matter in crops, causing soil compaction, reduced soil fertility, increased pests and diseases, and reduced fertilizer efficiency. Improper use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers can also produce carcinogenic nitrite compounds. Low-toxicity, high-efficiency pesticides are indeed indispensable, but we should protect the natural enemies of pests and diseases and emphasize biological control. Currently, the widespread use of plastic film coverage in farmlands nationwide is a new technology that promotes agricultural development. However, long-term use of plastic film coverage in farmlands results in an increasing accumulation of film residues in the soil, which not only directly hinders crop growth but also causes pollution. Effective measures should be taken to encourage the recovery of plastic film residues left in farmlands.

In summary, land is a means of production and an object of labor. Human survival and development cannot be separated from land, and arable land is the most important component of land resources. Most of the heat and protein that humans consume come directly or indirectly from arable land. The amount and quality of arable land per capita in a country are the most basic material conditions for the survival and development of a nation. China has a large population and limited arable land, which is a fundamental national condition. The shortage of arable land has become or is about to become an important factor restricting China's social development. Arable land is already one of the most scarce resources in China. Therefore, in the construction of China's four modernizations, we must attach great importance to and effectively protect the quantity and quality of arable land.

    怎样保护耕地的数量和质量
　　侯学煜
    据农业部统计，1979—1987年中，全国共减少耕地5251万亩，其中仅1985—1986年的两年中就减少2400万亩，相当于36个中等县的耕地面积。同时，工业和乡镇工业的污水，也污染了可观面积的耕地。人口在增加，而耕地面积却减少了，这是需要我们认真对待的一个大问题。怎样保护耕地的数量？
    要严禁侵占耕地：目前办工厂和乡镇企业浪费耕地十分严重，很多地方多征少用，征而不用。农民新建住房为什么一定要占肥美的农田，而不建在闲地或山坡上？目前有的省份盲目建筑高速公路，或扩大路面，这是否符合国情是值得思考的。一些地方的农民不利用天然水域养鱼，而挖良田作鱼塘；1985年我在江苏无锡调查时，地方上反映那一年中就挖了5万亩稻田作鱼塘。还有，开发露天矿产不恢复表土；到处利用农田土壤烧砖烧瓦等等，都侵占了若干面积的耕地。
    建筑水库要有多学科论证：解放以来，全国建筑无数大、中、小型水库，从发电、灌溉来说，完全是必要的；但有些是盲目进行的，例如山东临沂地区在“大跃进”中，修了1000多个大中小型水库，其中有个大型水库，淹没良田10万亩，30年来配套后只能灌溉6万亩农田，而发电收入，也不够电站开支，得不偿失。这只是一个典型的例子。别的地方类似这种情况的也有。
    控制水土流失：近年来长江上游由于乱砍森林、陡坡开垦，失去了森林涵养水源、削洪、滞洪、协调水量的功能，造成1981年四川特大洪灾，同年又使千百年来滋养川西平原的都江堰出现枯水期水源紧张的局面。西南主力电站之一的贵州乌江渡水电站，只运行9年，水库泥沙蓄积量就相当于原计划百年后的泥沙淤积的高程，导致水库寿命受到威胁。现在长江全流域水土流失占总面积的1／3，年流失土壤22.4亿吨，相当于每年损失30厘米厚的耕地830万亩。西北黄土高原由于毁林、毁草、开垦、打柴、过牧等原因，水土流失占流域总面积的80％，黄河每立方米水中含沙量达到37公斤以上，致使黄河7个大型水库库容已淤积40％，最多的已淤75％，现全流域已报废的水库约有1／3。防治水土流失必须严禁河流上游陡坡开垦，保护天然植被，并辅以必要的工程措施。
    防止耕地沙化：西北干旱荒漠区的南疆塔克拉玛干大沙漠内部是一片流动大沙丘，其边缘原来生长着红柳包、白刺包，这些固定“沙包”是保护绿洲的第一道屏障。可是在“大跃进”年代“砍尽千年红柳包，使沉睡的大地苏醒”的口号下，把“沙包”开垦为农田，结果形成流沙，流沙不仅不能种植庄稼，而且把农田埋掉，导致农户被迫搬家。北疆准噶尔盆地，原来分布着白梭梭、梭梭柴固定和半固定沙丘，固定沙丘植被被砍用作薪炭，导致新建的绿洲农田、村庄被风沙淹没，春季大风造成转场牲畜的大批死亡。半干旱草原地区由于滥垦、过度放牧和掠夺式挖草药，导致土地沙漠化。为了防止沙漠化，除保护天然植被外，在灌区沟渠还要营造小网络、窄林带的农田防护林网。东南沿海每年因受大风和台风登陆的影响，破坏农田、滩涂养殖场、水库及交通等设施。前清时代福建平潭县曾出现过“一夜沙埋十八村”的严重灾害。所以南方应加速营造沿海防护林网，形成真正的“绿色长城”，这是当务之急。
    防治耕地次生盐渍化：东北平原、黄淮海平原及西北干旱区的绿洲土壤都受着不同程度的次生盐渍化的威胁，许多低产田就是由于土壤次生盐渍化形成的。新疆4700万亩耕地就有30％的面积发生盐渍化，现在仍在不断扩大中，尤以南疆最为严重。南疆由于不合理营造许多平原水库，使原来底土含有的高量盐分通过地下水位上升，随着毛细管作用而达到表土，致使耕地有70％的面积次生盐渍化；还有农田无计划地掩荒休耕，因表土无覆盖，也促使表土返盐。防治土壤次生盐渍化，主要不能大水满灌，要有灌有排，而且要有计划地废除或加速改造西北一些有害的平原水库。怎样保护耕地的质量？
    防治工业尤其是乡镇工业的污染：目前工业特别是乡镇工业污染耕地十分严重。1986年我曾调查了山东省昌邑县的一个村，该村位于虞河河岸附近，由于潍坊市工厂和该县乡镇工业的印染、电镀、皮革、小造纸厂等工业污水排入虞河，再加工业废渣和垃圾向河内堆积，或经雨水淋洗，流入河内。70年代清澈的虞河，现在变成污水坑了。70年代这个村是山东著名的“鱼米之乡”，现在由于污水污染虞河和耕地，不仅鱼虾绝迹，不能种藕，连种粮食也只好靠打30—40米深的井水来灌溉农田；但井水也受污染，生长出来的粮食带有异味。全国未经处理的工业污水对耕地污染的严重性是普遍存在的。
    改造小土矿为现代化矿业：四川省南部搞土硫磺生产，平均每生产1吨硫磺，便向大气中排硫磺1吨，不仅浪费矿产资源，危害人体健康，且大量高浓度硫化物排到大气中，破坏附近植被，寸草不生，耕地也不能种植作物。该省某县原产500吨的油桐树因硫磺污染基本死亡。内蒙古兴和县店子乡和南湾乡有13座石墨矿排放的污废水、废油含有害化合物如二氧化铝及黄黑色臭油等，污染了附近农田万余亩，大部分耕地被油污染，春不作苗，使农田完全丧失可耕性。以上受污染的农田生产出来的粮食，通过食物链，自然危害人体健康。
    正确看待农业“化学化”问题：目前各方面都强调农业投入是正确的，但只限于提倡投入化肥、农药和地膜是不够全面的。化肥固然必要，但忽视有机肥，以致造成农作物缺乏全面养料和有机质、使土壤板结、地力衰退、病虫害增加，化肥的肥效愈来愈降低；化学氮肥施用不当，还易产生致癌物质亚硝酸盐类。轻毒高效的农药固不可缺少，但应保护病虫害的天敌，强调生物防治。目前全国农田普遍利用覆盖塑料薄膜是促进农业发展的一项新技术，可是长期用地膜覆盖农田；土壤中残膜会越积越多，既直接妨碍作物生长，又有污染；要采取鼓励收回残留在农田内的地膜的有效措施。
    总之，土地是生产资料与劳动对象，人类的生存与发展都离不开土地，而耕地则是土地资源中最重要的组成部分。人类消费大部分的热量和蛋白质，都直接、间接来自耕地，一个国家人均耕地的数量和质量是该国民族生存、发展的最基本的物质条件。人口多，耕地少，是我国的基本国情，耕地不足已经成为或即将成为制约我国社会发展的重要因素。耕地已经是我国最稀缺的资源之一，因此，在我国四个现代化的建设中，必须高度重视、切实保护好耕地的数量和质量。
