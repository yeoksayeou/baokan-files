The dragon and a song
Zhu Meiyun comes from a timeless legend
From the ancient and desolate primordial chaos
A song sung for five thousand years
Five thousand years
Carving itself into the image of a dragon
A dragon with the Great Wall on its forehead
The Yellow River surging in its chest
Carrying the winds of ninety thousand miles
Wrapping the clouds of ninety thousand miles
Planting a flag, riddled with bullet holes,
In the misty east

History is no longer
Each page is the sorrow of the yellow earth
The land is no longer
Each year is the poverty of the homeland
Satellites and cities, patch by patch,
Sing that song louder
Louder
Kunlun still stands tall and unyielding
The Yangtze still flows with ancient dreams
That song in the sky between history and the future
Is still filled with yellow, spirited vigor.

　　龙和一首歌
　　朱美云来自没有年代的传说来自远古苍凉的洪荒一首歌　唱了五千年五千年　把自己刻成龙的形象额上嵌着古长城胸中涌着黄河浪挟九万里风　裹九万里云把一面写满弹洞的旗帜插在烟雨茫茫的东方历史不再页页是黄土地的悲凉大地不再年年是贫穷的故乡一颗颗卫星和成片成片的城市把那首歌唱得更响　更响昆仑依旧昂着不屈的倔强长江依旧流着古老的梦想那首歌在历史与未来的上空依旧充满黄色的昂扬
