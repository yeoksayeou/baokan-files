The first set of special stamps in China themed around national defense construction, titled "National Defense Construction—Rocket Soaring," was officially released on November 15 in Beijing at the Second Artillery Corps' base. This set of stamps, designed by the young artist Yang Yi from the Second Artillery Corps, features four different poses of rockets: advancing, testing, launching, and flying. These innovative and distinctive stamps not only enrich the themes and content of stamps but also showcase the modernized construction of our military to the world.

    我国第一套以国防建设为题材的《国防建设——火箭腾飞》特种邮票，于11月15日在北京二炮驻地举行首发仪式。这套邮票，以火箭的不同姿态分为开进、检测、发射、飞行四枚，是二炮青年画家杨奕设计的。这套新颖别致的邮票，不仅丰富了邮票的题材和内容，而且向全世界展示了我军现代化建设的风姿。
