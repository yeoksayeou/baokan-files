	Water traffic safety has improved, and the Ministry of Communications is calling for further strengthening of water management.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 18 (Reporters Li Mei and Zhang Yong), reporters learned from the Ministry of Communications that China's water traffic safety management work has shown initial results. After several years of significant increases in accidents involving township and village transport vessels, the numbers began to decline last year; this year, the downward trend is even more pronounced. Statistics show that from January to September this year, the number of marine insurance accidents, shipwrecks, and deaths in various provinces and cities across the country decreased by 7.9%, 31.2%, and 29.6% respectively compared to the same period last year.

	Vice Minister of Communications Lin Zuyi said that we have always adhered to the principle of "safety first, prevention first" in transportation production. In recent years, the township and village shipping industry has developed vigorously, but the vessels and personnel engaged in these transports are seriously unqualified, and they often overload, leading to an annual increase in local water traffic accidents.

	Lin Zuyi emphasized that there are still many weak links in water traffic safety management. Major accidents still occur frequently. From January to September this year, there have been 66 major accidents, including 17 incidents where 10 or more people died; some local areas have not strictly approved the opening of water transport enterprises and have weak safety management; some shipping enterprises still have the tendency to prioritize production over safety, which has not been effectively corrected; some county and township governments have not truly implemented the responsibility system for the safety management of township and village transport vessels, and so on. We must seize the opportunity of rectification and strengthening, and strengthen water traffic safety management.

    水上交通安全状况有改善
    交通部要求进一步强化水上管理
    据新华社北京11月18日电 （记者李玫、张勇）记者从交通部获悉：我国水上交通安全管理工作初见成效。去年以来，乡镇运输船舶事故连续几年大幅度上升之后开始下降；今年下降趋势更为明显。据统计，今年1至9月，全国各省市发生的海损事故、沉船数及死亡人数分别比去年同期减少7.9％、31.2％和29.6％。
    交通部副部长林祖乙介绍说，我们历来在运输生产中贯彻“安全第一预防为主”的方针。近些年来，地方和乡镇船舶运输事业蓬勃发展，而从事这些运输的船舶和人员严重不合格，并且严重超载航行，地方水上交通事故逐年增加。
    林祖乙强调指出，目前水上交通安全管理工作仍有许多薄弱环节，重大事故仍时有发生，今年1至9月已发生重大事故66起，其中一次死亡10人以上的17起；局部地区对水运企业开业审批不严，安全管理不力；有的航运企业重生产、轻安全的倾向仍未得到有力的纠正；还有一些县乡政府对乡镇运输船舶的安全管理责任制没有真正落实等等。我们要抓住治理整顿的有利时机，强化水上交通安全管理。
