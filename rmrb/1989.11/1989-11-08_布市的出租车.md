Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, is renowned worldwide for its numerous sculptures. However, another notable feature of the city that is less known is its abundance of taxis. Buenos Aires has 45,000 taxis, with an average of one taxi for every 66 residents. This surpasses cities like Paris (one taxi for every 148 residents), Madrid (one taxi for every 206 residents), and Milan (one taxi for every 168 residents), placing Buenos Aires among the top cities in the world for taxi availability.

The taxis in Buenos Aires are uniformly painted yellow on top and black on the body, making them highly visible amidst the continuous flow of vehicles. Despite the city having nearly a million private cars, many people still prefer taxis for their convenience and peace of mind. Especially in the central areas where parking is difficult, taxis are the most convenient mode of transportation. These taxis cruise along the streets to pick up passengers and do not have fixed parking spots. Even in remote areas, taxis can be seen driving by. Most taxi drivers are self-employed, while a few car owners hire drivers and share the income on a 4:6 basis. The city government mandates that taxis cannot be older than eleven years, and all taxis must adhere to a uniform pricing standard set by the government. Therefore, most people buy second-hand or third-hand cars, paint them, and choose economical, fuel-efficient models. It is rare to find a taxi with air conditioning. For special occasions like weddings or funerals, there are specific types of large, high-end cars available for rent. The taxis in Buenos Aires can be described as old but convenient. No matter where you are, you can hail a taxi by waving your hand, and the driver will greet you before asking for your destination.

If it is inconvenient to hail a taxi due to time or location, you can call a dispatch center, and a taxi will arrive at the designated location within fifteen minutes. Additionally, you can make a reservation by phone. This 24-hour service dispatch center is not managed by taxi companies; individuals install a radio transceiver in their cars and pay a monthly fee to the dispatch center to join the system. Generally, taxi drivers are friendly, charge reasonable fares, and only ask that you do not smoke and close the door gently when exiting.

The income from driving a taxi is about one to two times higher than that of a skilled worker, with no taxes to pay and no need for specialized skills. Therefore, many people are willing to do this job, but first, they need to invest in buying a car. To protect the interests of those in the industry, the city government issues taxi operating licenses with strict controls. Currently, there are 35,000 taxis registered with the government management department, but the number of taxis operating on the streets far exceeds this figure. According to estimates from the Traffic Management Bureau, there are about 10,000 unlicensed taxis in the city. These unlicensed taxis are referred to as "rogue taxis" by their peers. The chairman of the Taxi Owners Association revealed that a significant number of these "rogue taxis" are driven by police officers who, due to poor economic conditions, drive taxis as a side job. The proliferation of unlicensed taxis infringes on the interests of legitimate operators. The Buenos Aires City Council has included the issue of excessive taxis in its agenda and is preparing to take necessary measures to address the problem.

    布市的出租车
    本报记者　李志明
    阿根廷首都布宜诺斯艾利斯素以雕塑多闻名于世，然而，该城还有一多鲜为人知，就是出租汽车多。布市共有四万五千辆出租车，平均六十六个居民一辆，超过了巴黎（一百四十八人一辆）、马德里（二百零六人一辆）、米兰（一百六十八人一辆）等欧洲大城市，居世界各大都市前列。
    布市的出租汽车一律漆成黄顶黑身，在川流不息的汽车洪流中十分显眼。虽然布市有近百万辆私人轿车，还是有很多人愿乘出租车，一图方便，二图省心。特别是在停车困难的中心区，最方便的交通工具莫过于出租车了。这里的出租车都是沿街兜揽生意，没有固定的停车点，在偏僻的街区也不时有出租车驶过。出租车司机多为“个体户”，少数车主有一辆或几辆车雇人驾驶，收入四六分。市政府规定出租车最高车龄十一年，无论何种车型一律按市政府公布的统一标准收费。因此，多数人是买二手车、三手车，喷上漆就得，车型也是选经济省油的，全市找不到几辆带冷气的。若是结婚或送葬，专有一种庄重的大型高级车供租用。布市的出租车可用破旧二字形容。不过旧虽旧，却很方便。无论在哪儿，招手即停，上车后司机先问好，车子启动后才问乘客去哪里。
    如果因时间或地点问题叫车不方便，可以打电话给调度中心，不到十五分钟便会有辆车开到指定地点。另外，还可电话预约。这种二十四小时服务的调度中心并不归出租汽车公司管，个人自己花钱在车里装一部无线电报话器，按月向调度中心交费，就可以加入这个系统。一般出租车司机都是态度和蔼，收费合理，至多要求你不要抽烟，下车关门轻点儿。
    开出租车的收入高于熟练工人的一二倍，不交税，又不需专门技术，因此愿干这行的人很多，当然首先要投资买车。为了保护从业者的利益，市政府颁发出租营业执照是有控制的。目前在政府管理部门登记注册的有三万五千辆，但在街上兜生意的远远超过这个数。据交通管理局估计，全市约有一万辆无照营业的。同行把他们称作“游鱼”。据出租汽车业主协会主席透露，相当数量的“游鱼”是警察，他们因经济状况不好，以开出租车为副业。大量“黑车”的出现，侵犯了合法从业者的利益。现在布市议会已把解决出租车过多问题列入议程，准备采取必要的措施。
