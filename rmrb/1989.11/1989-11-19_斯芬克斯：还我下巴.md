The Sphinx, guardian of the Egyptian pyramids, once again calls out: "Return my jaw!" Recently, the United Nations passed a resolution with 139 votes in favor and 16 abstentions, stating that countries should return their valuable cultural artifacts to their original owners. Egyptian Ambassador to the United Nations, Badr, loudly proclaimed at the international forum in New York that the Sphinx's jaw and thousands of other illegally plundered national treasures should be promptly returned to Egypt to ensure the complete protection of human civilization's ancient relics. The Egyptian Minister of Culture also instructed the compilation of a list of stolen artifacts sent abroad, to be submitted to UNESCO and major Western museums.

The Sphinx (also known as the Great Sphinx of Giza) is a symbol of power and wisdom from the Pharaoh era, guarding the pyramids day and night. It stands 20 meters high and stretches 57 meters long, carved from a natural rock formation. Legend has it that the cobra on the Sphinx's forehead and the braided beard are symbols of ultimate authority. Unfortunately, its face has been damaged, with the jaw and beard completely detached.

There are many theories about the Sphinx's disfigurement. Some say it was damaged by Napoleon's troops using cannons, while others claim it was deliberately destroyed by local heretics who knocked off its nose and jaw. Fortunately, the Sphinx's jaw has not been lost. It broke into three pieces; one piece is severely damaged and its original position is unrecognizable, one piece is preserved in the Egyptian Museum, and the other piece, about a quarter of the jaw and beard, is now housed in the British Museum.

As early as the 1970s, the Egyptian government began negotiations with Britain to retrieve the Sphinx's jaw. In 1981, based on UNESCO documents, they entered into talks with the British Museum. The British side, however, used various excuses to delay the return, leaving the Sphinx's jaw and beard still separated.

The groundwater level in the Pyramid area is rising year by year, and the saline and alkaline water is eroding the stone blocks that make up the pyramids, causing the Sphinx's rock structure to become brittle. Experts have determined that if not reinforced in time, the massive head will fall due to the erosion of the neck's rock structure. The best reinforcement plan is to restore the original jaw and beard to the neck, supporting the precarious head. Therefore, the piece in the British Museum, which is about a quarter of the jaw and beard, is no longer just a matter of "restoring the original state," but also concerns the "life" of the Sphinx.

    斯芬克斯：还我下巴
    林皎明
    守卫在埃及金字塔身边的狮身人面像再次发出呼号：快点归还我的下巴！最近，联合国以一百三十九票赞成，十六票弃权通过决议，各国珍贵文物应物归原主。埃及驻联合国大使巴达维在纽约国际讲坛上大声疾呼，斯芬克斯的下巴以及上千件被非法掠夺的珍贵国宝应该尽快归还埃及，使人类文明古迹得到完整保护。埃及文化部长也指示开列盗运国外的文物清单，送交联合国教科文组织及西方各大博物馆。
    狮身人面像（又名斯芬克斯）是埃及法老时代权力和智慧的象征，日夜护守着金字塔。它坐高二十米，卧长五十七米，在天然岩石上雕成。传说，狮身人面像额顶上的腹蛇及扎成柱状的胡须，是盖世权威的标志。可惜的是，它的面部已经被损坏，下巴和胡须完全脱落。
    狮身人面像毁容的说法很多。有的说，是拿破仑军队入侵后用炮轰击致残，有的说，是本地异教徒故意把它的鼻子和下巴打掉。幸运的是，狮身人面像的下巴并没有失落。它破裂成三块，一块已破损严重无法辨认位置，一块珍藏在埃及博物馆，另一块，约占下巴胡须的四分之一，现在大英博物馆珍藏。
    早在七十年代初，埃及政府便与英国交涉索还狮身人面下巴，一九八一年又根据教科文组织有关文件与大英博物馆谈判。英国方面以种种借口搪塞，拖延归还时间。使狮身人面像至今须首异地。
    金字塔地区的地下水位逐年上升，含盐碱水份浸渍构筑金字塔的石块，酥脆狮身人面像的岩质。古物专家们测定，如不及时加固，硕大沉重的头颅会因为颈部岩质风化侵蚀而坠落。一种最佳加固方案，便是将原有的下巴和胡须重新修复在颈部，支撑摇摇欲坠的头部。因此，留在大英博物馆的那四分之一，已不简单是“完璧归赵”的问题，而且牵连着斯芬克斯的“生命”。
