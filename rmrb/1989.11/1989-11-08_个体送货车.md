Supermarkets have dominated the major cities of West Germany for many years, pushing out many individual small shops. These small shops have finally come up with a clever strategy: they are returning to traditional sales methods, delivering goods door-to-door.

In today's West Germany, there are many people who work on a piecework basis, visiting several locations a day; some even operate computers from home. An increasing number of elderly people find it burdensome to go out shopping. Therefore, many urban residents hope for someone to deliver goods to their doorstep. Although the goods delivered by individual delivery vehicles are relatively expensive, they save customers the trouble of going out, making them quite convenient and popular.

Last year, the annual sales of a household goods delivery vehicle reached 600,000 marks, roughly twice that of a similarly sized shop that waits for customers to come in. These delivery vehicles, converted from vans or buses, are categorized by the type of goods they carry, traveling day and night through the streets. Statistics show that there are currently 60,000 such delivery vehicles in West Germany.

The goods in these delivery vehicles are diverse. Some are filled with daily necessities, others supply medical and health care products or equipment, some specialize in fresh fish, shrimp, or fruit, and there are even those that turn a bookstore into a mobile one, with thousands of books neatly arranged for open-shelf sales. To help residents identify the delivery vehicles, most owners creatively mark the vehicles with signs or write the store name. One vehicle named "3F" has pictures of various goods it supplies painted all around its body, making it easy for customers to recognize.

    个体送货车
    超级市场占据西德各大城市许多年后，那些被排挤掉的个体小商店终于想出了一记高招：重新采用传统的销售方式，穿街走巷，送货上门。
    在今日西德，一天走几处干计件活的大有人在；有的干脆在家里操纵电脑；日益增多的老年人深感出门购物之累；因此许多城镇居民希望有人上门送货。尽管个体送货车的东西较贵，但让人不费抬脚之力，相当便利，因而颇受青睐。
    去年，一辆日用品送货车的年销售额高达60万马克，大致为同等规模却“守株待兔”的商店的两倍。那些由“小面包”或公共汽车改装的送货车，分门别类装着某种商品，日夜不停地穿行在大街小巷中。据统计，这类送货车目前在西德已发展到6万辆。
    送货车的商品各具特色。有的满载生活用品，有的供应医疗保健药品或器具，有的专售新鲜鱼、虾或水果，还有的干脆将一个书店搬上车，成千上万本书一式排开，开架销售。为了便于市民识别送货车，大部分货主都巧妙地在车身标上记号或写明店牌。有辆称作“3F”的送货车，在车体四周画上供应的各色商品，令顾客一目了然。（王建勋　编译）
