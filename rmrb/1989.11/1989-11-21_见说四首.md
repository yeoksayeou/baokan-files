The economic growth in some Asian countries and regions is said to be due to the practice of Confucianism. Whether Confucianism can guide modernization or whether it pulls modern life back into Confucian thought is a topic I am not qualified to discuss. I have jotted down a few humorous verses to express my doubts. The language is crude and not worthy of expert commentary.

	Seeing and Hearing Four Verses
	By Liu Da Nian

	In Asia, some countries and regions have seen economic growth,
	It is said that this is due to the practice of Confucian teachings.
	Can Confucianism guide modernization,
	Or does it pull modern life back into Confucian thought?
	I am not qualified to discuss this,
	So I have written a few humorous verses to express my doubts.
	The language is crude and not worthy of expert commentary.

	Seeing and Hearing the First Verse:
	The five dragons of Asia—Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan—
	Are soaring high in the sky, changing the world.
	The tail of the dragon is already visible,
	Even the spirit of Lord Ye is scattered.
	The descendants of the Qinghai region are prospering.
	The descendants of the Qinghai region are prospering.
	The descendants of the Qinghai region are prospering.
	The descendants of the Qinghai region are prospering.

	Seeing and Hearing the Second Verse:
	Why is it that the teachings of the sages are so effective?
	It is because of the teachings of the sages.
	It is not surprising that the ancient teachers were not benevolent,
	For even the disciples of Confucius were poor,
	Living in humble dwellings without the heart to ask for more.
	The walls of the house were mud, and the sound of the wind was unpleasant.
	The soldiers of the Xiang Army wept in vain,
	Kneeling and crying to the likes of Yuan Shikai.
	Is this not the result of deep learning?
	They crossed the sea and floated on the waves,
	Learning from their successors.

	Seeing and Hearing the Third Verse:
	Speaking of benevolence and righteousness, it is like smoke,
	Only the dream of the Duke of Zhou is not passed down.
	From ancient times, all schools of thought have been dismissed,
	Until today, the descendants of the Duke of Zhou still sing songs.
	The ancient masters rode on cows and played the zither,
	The later sages carried begging bowls.
	The later sages carried begging bowls.
	The later sages carried begging bowls.
	The later sages carried begging bowls.

	Seeing and Hearing the Fourth Verse:
	One coin, one fruit, they fight over each other.
	Modern subtle words are not allowed to be spoken lightly.
	The great scholar writes, bringing disaster upon himself.
	The blue sky transmits words, and the times are changing.
	The new Confucians have a way, pushing the gentlemen's old shop.
	I have no reason to worship the sage.
	I myself have passed by the Sand Beach Building,
	Pitifully, Mr. De and Mr. Sai.

	(1) From Li Shangyin's poem: "Since the prosperous times, the emperor has not made a tour, until now, there are still descendants of the dragon in Qinghai."
	(2) Sakyamuni and Confucius were contemporaries, but Buddhism entered China much later, so it is said that the later sages were wrong.
	(3) Liang Qichao said: "Confucianism has been practiced for more than two thousand years. People are like a group of monkeys fighting over a fruit, and women are like a group of old women fighting over a coin, screaming and grabbing each other, a pitiful sight."
	(4) Zhang Taiyan quoted the words of a Japanese man, Rongji: "Confucius is the root of China's disasters."
	(5) Han Fuquan respected Confucius, saying that Confucius is popular again. After Han was killed, a small book called "Such a Blue Sky" became popular.

  亚洲一些国家和地区经济增长，据说得力于奉行孔学。到底是孔学可以指导现代化还是要把现代生活拉回到孔学思想里面去，没有本领参加讨论，打油数首存疑。文字粗鄙，不足以当方家一噱。一见说亚洲起五龙星韩台港九州东云中变化神藏尾世上飞腾画点瞳已令叶公魂魄散又传青海子孙逢（一）问渠哪得灵如许端在圣人教化功二敢怪先师竟不仁束脩到手薄乡亲颜回陋巷无心问宰我泥墙厌耳闻痛哭湘军空泪涕叩头袁氏等埃尘莫非深造乘桴去跨海飘洋学后人三称仁述义浩如烟只有周公梦不传自昔百家皆罢黜至今阙里尚歌弦骑牛老子徒前辈托缽瞿昙枉后贤（二）独少中华龙起陆烦谁对此解茫然四

  （一）李商隐诗：自是明时不巡幸，至今青海有龙孙。（二）释迦牟尼与孔子同时，佛教传入中国则在孔子以后甚久，故曰后贤。（三）梁启超说：孔教行二千余年，众人如群猿得一果，群妪得一钱，诟詈相夺，跳掷相攫，情状可怜。（四）章太炎引述日人远藤隆吉的话：“孔子为支那祸本”。（五）韩复榘尊孔，说孔子又行时了。韩被杀后流行一本小册子，叫《如此韩青天》。
