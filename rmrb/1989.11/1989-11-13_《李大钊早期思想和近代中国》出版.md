Edition: 6

The book "Li Dazhao's Early Thoughts and Modern China" by Zhu Chengjia has been published by Hebei People's Publishing House. The book primarily discusses the relationship between Li Dazhao's early thoughts and significant historical events such as the late Qing Dynasty's preparatory constitutionalism, the Xinhai Revolution, the anti-Yuan struggle, the protection of the law struggle, World War I, the October Revolution, and the May Fourth Movement. It also explores his relationships with revolutionary and reformist factions, as well as with Eastern and Western cultures and social trends. The book adheres to the principle of seeking truth from facts, clarifying important historical and theoretical issues that have existed in Li Dazhao research for many years. The book uses facts to fully illustrate the arduous and tortuous process of Li Dazhao's search for a path to save the country and the people, and explains that the spread of Marxism in China was a careful choice and a necessity of historical development. This book is an important achievement in Li Dazhao research.
