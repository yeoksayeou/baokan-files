The sentinels of the economic frontier have taken their posts at the Beijing Dongcheng District Bureau of Industry and Commerce. The 48th train from Guangzhou is about to arrive. Inside the exit hall, a few individuals wearing light blue uniforms and caps adorned with the national emblem stand quietly. Law-abiding travelers might never notice their presence, but once they do, they will find that each pair of eyes under the caps emits an extraordinary penetrating gaze.

"Excuse me, sir," a middle-aged man with gray hair and a slightly plump figure addresses a tall, thin young man wearing glasses. The young man's folding travel cart carries two large bags. No mistake, they contain foreign cigarettes, and in excess.

"How many?" the inspector asks. "Fifty packs," the young man replies. "For how many people?" "Five people." "Why are they all in your bag?" "We all went to Guangzhou together..."

The tall young man quickly retrieves something from his waist pouch and, with a sleight of hand, passes it to the inspector, muttering a smile.

"Son, go fishing in the river, not here," the inspector responds with a hint of humor amidst his stern demeanor.

Ro Jianzhi, formerly a company commander in the People's Liberation Army, has been transferred to the Beijing Inspection Station of the Dongcheng District Bureau of Industry and Commerce for just half a year. Here, rank does not matter; everyone stands guard, including the station chief. This morning, he happened to see the old station chief, Ren Fulin, quickly checking suspicious videotapes on a TV. According to regulations, this task is solely his responsibility, and he is busy and disheveled. Someone outside says they watch the confiscated videotapes themselves, but Ren Fulin just laughs, "There's no such thing! Look at this pile, it's a tough job, my eyes are about to get infected..."

Let's talk about Ro Jianzhi. He brings the people to the office, first inviting in the woman, the director of a garment factory in Beijing. Perhaps it was the work permit she handed over that made this state official blush, and she immediately confessed everything. It turned out that someone on the train had sold her 10 packs of foreign cigarettes at a discount, and she used this small favor to cover for four strangers. The case was handled swiftly and efficiently, with unrelated individuals released and only the tall young man detained. The inspection revealed two daggers, 18 sets of obscene playing cards, 20 used clothes, 4 sets of clothes without receipts, 40 packs of foreign cigarettes, and a precious waist pouch containing 18 gold rings weighing 99 grams. Additionally, there was a small shoulder bag with a copy of "Sexy Killer" and "Night Talks on Sex Life" published by a certain publishing house.

The young man was stunned, his face pale. "I... it's my first time, over ten thousand yuan!" The guy was about to cry. "Young man, playing this game, huh... write down the process, see your attitude."

Actually, what is truly admirable is Ro Jianzhi's "attitude." For this case involving five deadly sins and a desperate criminal, he remained calm and composed, adhering to policy without losing his composure. According to him, the only inspection station in Beijing, every day has some seizures, especially for trains from coastal open areas, one must be extra vigilant.

These are another pair of vigilant eyes, bright and sharp, yet delicate. Wang Qing, the newly promoted female deputy station chief, is 27 years old, tall and slender, with outstanding talent and appearance. Although she seems shy and hesitant when asked to give a statement, when on duty, she is bold and articulate, like a different person. Today, she stopped a Northeast man carrying two Japanese video cameras without receipts. Inside the case, there might also be "yellow goods," and she is currently connecting the power to rewind the tape for the station chief to check.

Wang Qing has developed a fairly accurate judgment. Once, a fashionable woman walked past her, seemingly ordinary, but her luggage was not. The basket contained only a few packs of biscuits and a few cans of drinks. Who returns from Guangzhou without large and small fashionable items, why does she carry so little? Yes, doing industrial and commercial inspections, one must at least be half a Sherlock Holmes, good at logical reasoning, quick-witted and sharp-eyed, able to quickly identify suspicious individuals from the chaotic crowd, otherwise, opportunities slip away in an instant.

"Excuse me, where have you been?" "To Zhuhai." "Just brought back these things..." Wang Qing weighed the basket, unusually heavy. She moved aside the surface biscuits, revealing a cloth bag wrapped in several layers. Opening it, she found 250 gold rings, totaling 1500 grams.

"Sister," the woman pleaded in a low voice, "let me go, we'll split it."

"This thing is hot, I don't dare take it..." Wang Qing just smiled indifferently. The handling result was serious and fair. Most were confiscated, the rest were purchased at official prices. As for why it was handled this way, the calculation method is a bit complicated, and it won't be explained here.

Women committing crimes, using people's pity and sympathy, is also a current "trend." Female inspectors dealing with them naturally have their advantages. Wang Qing recently, together with another inspector, caught a woman. She was thin, carrying a small bag, walking casually, with almost no flaws in her appearance and posture. Just a glance, that gaze seemed to avoid intentionally. Thus, she was brought to the inspection station and exposed. This woman had 400-plus imported watches and lighters wrapped around her waist, legs, and crotch, valued at over 500,000 yuan. She confessed that she was hired, and because of her slim figure, she could easily hide contraband without appearing bulky, perhaps a new trick of smugglers.

Wang Qing proudly said that a few years ago, the case of smuggling cigarettes by mail between Shenyang and Yingkou was also handled by them. She once kept an eye on an old woman, finding only a small amount of foreign cigarettes in her box, but the person subconsciously covered her small handbag. Perhaps this was a trick? Indeed, 150-plus mail receipts were found in the bag, each with a different name, secretly mailing over 300 packs of cigarettes. The old station chief introduced that Wang Qing had also seized a batch of 500 daggers and spring knives and other prohibited items... "Her eyesight can top a radar!" the station chief laughed.

However, who would have thought that this female inspector had to bear such a heavy burden? With elderly parents and young children at home, she starts her early shift at 4:30 AM to welcome the train's arrival. Often, she works non-stop until nightfall, with only ten or twenty minutes for lunch, eating instant noodles or dry bread.

"I have a sense of accomplishment in this job, one learns as one does, right..." She said it quite lightly.

Ma Runhai is the youngest in the inspection station and also the pride of his colleagues. Advanced worker, outstanding new long march participant, excellent party member, he has many titles, but you wouldn't guess he is only 24 years old, with a weak constitution and having to take care of his sick parents and a difficult family. The stubborn young man studies at a night school while achieving remarkable feats.

From Beijing to Harbin, a train is about to depart. A young woman carrying a paper box hurriedly enters the station. Something is amiss—a detail out of place! Even if the lawbreaker is a genius actor, they cannot hide their psychological imbalance!

"What are you carrying?" "Newspapers, magazines..." Strange, who would bother to carry old newspapers and magazines with only scrap value? This woman doesn't look like a scholar! Uncovering the surface disguise, 72 boxes of videotapes are revealed, American, Japanese, Nordic, all XXX-rated pornographic films.

He also encountered a cunning and stubborn ex-convict, caught smuggling over 500 watches. When caught, he played dead, screaming about his losses, threatening to take revenge if he survived. Another man selling video cameras, soft and hard persuasion, calling out "Big Brother, show mercy once," taking advantage of the lack of people around him to offer bribes, increasing the price. Like these secrets known only to heaven and earth, Ma Runhai has encountered countless such incidents. To accept the bribe would also "make it," but for him, rejecting bribes is not difficult, the difficult part is not acting rashly because of his youth. His signature move is "strict inspection, reasonable punishment, combining punishment and education, focusing on the heart." It is precisely because of his excellent spiritual strategy that many smugglers surrendered, revealing the truth, expanding the results. In one year, he uncovered 747 illegal cases, 23 major cases over 10,000 yuan, and confiscated over 190,000 yuan. The price paid was attending duty for 356 days, working overtime 187 times, with only 5-6 hours of sleep each day!

Inside the inspection station, there are always people crying, making a fuss, swearing, pretending to be good, pounding their chests, and sobbing. Almost every criminal is a scene of danger. From here, one can see officials and private individuals colluding to deceive, fake receipts and counterfeit goods rolling together, and also see desperate self-harm, poisoning, head-banging, being sent to the hospital for rescue, and bankrupt and desperate criminals. Of course, more people hit a wall, enlightened the ignorant, and then returned to the right path. However, this room full of rich content is indeed shabby, made of iron sheets and steel frames temporarily assembled, crowded with people, noisy, stuffy in summer, and freezing in winter. It's a miracle that these mentally strong industrial and commercial sentinels can endure such hardships here day after day.

"To say that we handle thousands of cases a year, turning over nearly a million yuan to the national treasury, the amount is not large. But standing at the gate, representing the economic order of the country, preventing and investigating many criminal activities, letting those who intended to test the law know the danger and retreat. Imagine, if this gate were missing, what would happen..." It seems that Station Chief Ren Fulin's words are more philosophical.

In the face of power and lawbreakers

Mark Twain said, the law is like a spider web, it can catch small insects, but big birds can fly through. The "insects" at the train station are naturally not comparable to the "big birds" with power as wings, but is the industrial and commercial law net so easy to pass through? A popular saying in Beijing goes: ordinary people work a lifetime, individual businesses work for a while, but they can't compare to officials making money in an instant. It also says: officials have no definition, the law has loopholes, after half a year of hard work, there are always gods to save you. What is the real situation? "The dual-track pricing system opened up, and the new industry of using power to make money and using connections to make money began to flourish in 1988." The responsible comrade of the enterprise supervision section said with a hint of bitterness, "In order to benefit themselves and their employees, many companies and enterprise legal persons participated in speculation and profiteering. Therefore, we established the economic inspection section and the enterprise supervision section, specially to deal with the 'big birds,' the complexity and difficulty of which outsiders cannot imagine..."

Let's first see how a bird hatched from an egg is caught. A small state-owned electro-mechanical company in Zhuozhou County, Hebei Province, also dreamed of making money in the car resale wave, and coincidentally met a small business employee in Beijing named Ren Ningning, who managed to get a car at a controlled price, thus establishing a Beijing branch. The self-appointed manager Ren Ningning, in order to deceive heaven and earth for his great cause, privately added a pause after "car storage" in the business scope on the license, turning a small warehouse into a grand official car dealership.

Ren Ningning, with this license, sailed smoothly. First, he won over the financial supervisor sent by Zhuozhou County; then, he bribed local officials, establishing a guerrilla base in a certain township in the Beijing suburbs; finally, he aimed at the ideal target—the manager of the mechanical equipment division of the Beijing Electro-Mechanical Company, Bian Liuquan. In order to capture this big customer with a large number of controlled-price cars, he bet big, using the name of the branch but actually using his own money, covering all restricted group consumption projects for the other party, meetings, travel, dining, and even sportswear, BB machines, etc., all free of charge. He also bought dollars at a high price for speculation and exchanged a high-end car worth 100,000 yuan for an old car worth 30,000 yuan to show his goodwill. No wonder the big customer affectionately called out: "Ningning, you are so good..."

Good to what extent, the source of goods, funds, accounts, and various profitable businesses, all let him monopolize, the equipment division has become his "full-service nanny," and that county-run "small shop" has actually developed into an underground car trading center in North China. Ren Ningning's briefcase is full of contracts, agreements, invoices, blank driver's licenses, foreign exchange drafts, customs certificates, and has established hotlines in every province and city except Tibet and Taiwan, with transactions often in the hundreds of thousands.

When the value of that pause worth a thousand gold was discovered, the problem fell to Dongcheng District, which was not the original approval authority. Due to the involvement of major commercial customers in Beijing, various public relations, and local protectionism, the case was complicated, and interference was rampant, making people daunted. Just take a look at the "cooperative attitude" of a certain bureau: "Go ahead and check, two tables of accounts, and two more rooms behind, if you have the ability, go ahead!" The two accountants specially invited were taken aback, if they were to clarify the origin and development of those numbers according to the usual methods, it would take two or three years; even if they could find out the whereabouts of over 200 cars without purchase orders, it would take half a year or more for the entire section to be on the move. However, a miracle happened, and the economic inspection section's Zhang Aidong calmly smiled: "They miscalculated, doing economic inspections is not easy to bully! Isn't there a movie called 'Outwitting the Enemy'? You have a way to set up obstacles, I have a way to take a shortcut, you play the game of officials protecting officials, I still have the organization and the masses to rely on. Specific details are not necessary to repeat, lest other worms learn from it. Of course, we also suffered a lot, working with the public security department to pull that Ren Ningning around the world, running hundreds of miles a day. When arriving at a place not suitable for banquets, we still had to pay for his meals ourselves, to give him some 'enthusiasm.' After the case was handled, we also gained an unexpected benefit: significant weight loss."

The investigation results showed that in less than a year, 528 cars were resold, 363 of which were sold in Beijing, with a total amount of 9.21 million yuan, and illegal profits of over 380,000 yuan. Finally, various operating units and individuals were fined and confiscated a total of 800,000 yuan, and a group of criminals were sent to the public security, procuratorate, and court. Those big and small birds who thought they could get away were dumbfounded.

"Know that socialist China does not practice dollar politics, and big businesses cannot buy extraterritorial rights!" Zhang Aidong said.

Another car case, although not too complicated, had more air superiority than Ren Ningning. The Beijing procurement station of the Inner Mongolia Materials Bureau was limited to the procurement service of its own region when it was licensed. Unexpectedly, under the name of special treatment, it purchased scarce goods, buying over 500 cars in two years, only 81 of which were sold to the local area, each earning a meager profit of 1.11 yuan, isn't that foolish? Originally, the intention was not there, the remaining 400-plus cars were sold to various provinces across the country, with invoices manipulated to arbitrarily increase the price, earning a huge profit of 560,000 yuan, and also illegally profiting from the sale of color TVs, refrigerators, and video cameras, approximately 30,000 yuan. After the case was exposed, many intermediaries came, whether to investigate or not, many departments were at a loss, and even took the matter to the then vice chairman of the state. Fortunately, the vice chairman was keenly aware and immediately expressed support for the investigation, opposed speculation and profiteering, angrily knocking his cane to drive away the intercessors. Although they hit a nail, the materials bureau still sent people to ask for special treatment, hoping to settle the matter privately. The enforcers sternly warned them: the law is above personal relationships, and it is useless to wave anyone's flag. The outcome of this case was the confiscation of their illegal gains of over 590,000 yuan and the public announcement of the case, with the relevant personnel dealt with according to the law!

With the car fever, the color TV fever also arose. The small-sized home appliance, with scattered operations, coming and going without a trace, is even more difficult to investigate. One day last year, a suspicious unloading was found at a certain place, and by following the clues, they unexpectedly entered a maze. It took great effort to finally clarify a marathon connection map: the original selling unit, Xiamen Qingsheng Company, sold in bulk to the Beijing Urban-Rural Trade Center, which then handed over part of it to Jingpeng Company to collect "consulting fees," and another part was sold to Huada Company, which then sold to Lingyun Company, which then sold to Yunhua Company... What a long list! And in order to avoid inspection, the clever bosses injected anti-inspection factors at the beginning of purchasing, turning color TVs into "projection equipment" or "monitor," setting smoke screens in advance to cover their retreat. This batch of treasures, after "commodity grand tour, price snowballing," each unit increased from 1900 yuan to 2900 yuan, with a total of 200,000 yuan being divided among them. Without undertaking any commercial risks, without paying any labor costs, "official speculators," official thieves!

A commercial and industrial cadre said that in this long and winding series, most of these official speculation cases would perform a typical three-act play. The first is "resist": refusing to investigate, finding superiors who do not receive, not sending clerks to the scene, knowing that the industrial and commercial department has no power to detain people, what to fear? The second is "evade": hiding and playing hide-and-seek, kicking the ball around, dragging you for half a century, making you exhausted and helpless. The third is "beg": when it really can't be endured, calling in relatives and friends, treating and bribing, lowering one's head, from a good cigarette to gold and silver, from Donglaishun to Maxim's, suffering a small loss but still occupying a big advantage. "However, in our place," this cadre said, "all kinds of tricks are ineffective, the last episode of the series must be the confiscation of all illegal gains plus fines or going to court. Some big shots with strong backing were cut to the bone, but they did not dare to resist, only grumbling 'damn son of a bitch' and that's it."

As for those with bigger backgrounds, they involve various companies in the M sector. A collective enterprise with a business scope of providing overseas commercial information was found to be illegally operating production materials. The person in charge of the case recounted—

The first round of evidence collection gave a warning shot, the deputy general manager declared: "All secrets, no obligation to provide materials!" The second round, the superior of the company ordered the industrial and commercial bureau chief to "meet," setting the reception time close to dinner time, the intention was clear, fortunately, the bureau chief politely declined. The third round changed tactics again, providing materials that did not match the facts to muddy the waters, repeatedly emphasizing their "special nature of business," saying "no profit, if there is profit, it is for the public..." and so on.

I warned him that if the matter is not clarified, there are three ways out: one, freeze the account, you will stop business immediately; two, appeal to public opinion, publish your case; three, transfer to your superior disciplinary committee for handling, you may face double punishment. I also told him an example, also from the M sector, a certain cultural station selling color TVs, the industrial and commercial department went to inspect, not even raising an eyelid, the attitude was even more arrogant than yours. Sorry, we sent the collected evidence to their superior disciplinary committee, the result was an internal notice for severe punishment.

That arrogant deputy manager was scared this time, fearing that the lawsuit would ruin his career, the next day he provided the real case, and then came to the bureau to apologize, handing over the illegal gains of 650,000 yuan.

"From this, it can be seen that one must believe in an old saying: evil cannot overcome justice." The case handler said, "In the face of power, one should not be afraid, the more afraid, the more one is bullied. Only lawbreakers are truly afraid!"

In fact, dealing with these official speculators who still have financial strength is not very difficult as long as one has integrity. The most troublesome are those pieced-together shell companies. Speaking of the commercial fever a few years ago, a bunch of congenital defects sprouted up like mushrooms after rain, and when the cleanup began, they tasted the bitter fruit.

Wang Yimin, the manager of Tongqiao Trade Company, had no money, falsely reported capital to establish the company, and signed contracts with various places across the country to supply "shadow color TVs" totaling 19,000 units, deceiving a prepayment of 3.165 million yuan, including 200,000 yuan from the disaster relief fund for the disabled in Tangshan. This scammer squandered his money, and when the trick was exposed, he fled, leaving the company's staff clueless, and the greedy sucker heads were in a hurry. At this critical moment, the industrial and commercial bureau, together with the public security department, acted decisively, returning the first discovered debt to Tangshan in advance, and the disaster victims were moved to tears. Ten-plus fraudsters were caught without exception.

"We can responsibly say," the comrades of the enterprise supervision section said, "many companies within our jurisdiction indeed have problems of varying degrees. In the 195 companies that have been sampled, 94 have been dealt with. It must be acknowledged that the strong deterrent effect has greatly reduced illegal activities. But there is a trend worth noting, the so-called financial decoupling, resigning one end, often just going through the motions; openly decoupling but secretly not, resigning people but not benefits, still relying on the privileges of the original superior department to survive. We want to appeal that one should not rely on short-term policies, but should formulate stable, complete, and rigid regulations, so that speculators have no loopholes to exploit."

Various individual business owners

"We are enforcers, more importantly, we are service providers and propagandists, we should do people's work in advance." A section chief of the market management office said.

Strolling in Wangfujing, the Imperial City Wall, Donghua Gate, Longfu Temple, and Dongdan night markets, bustling, noisy, shoulder to shoulder, chaotic yet seemingly reflecting some invisible restraint and order. These so-called free markets rely on what to maintain the balance of freedom and order in commodity economy? He said: "We regard the market as an open economic exhibition, to a considerable extent, it also represents the local image. People's first impression of a certain city or even a certain country, isn't it often from strolling the streets?"

In order to build a civilized market, they thought of many methods, and once even invited some martial arts masters from the Elderly Committee to assist in management, who were meticulous and dared to fine and confiscate. Unexpectedly, after subduing one troublemaker, three more hooligans appeared, the more they subdued, the more chaotic it became. Later, they tasted the flavor, although they were commercial and profit-oriented, merchants were still ordinary people with souls. This is when they further realized that they should improve the management philosophy, combining persuasion and education with economic penalties, letting them experience that the workers are here to take care of them, and only legal operations are the safest way to make money. How was the effect? A certain country's embassy is right next to a certain market, and when they come out to buy things, they feel that China's economic reform is disorderly but not chaotic, unified but not dead, indeed very characteristic.

In this 150-plus stall market, part of the stall owners have criminal records, and there are also many "free citizens" with mental gaps. Family disputes need to be managed, marriage and divorce also need to be managed; family planning, linking up for treatment, adults and children going to school, all need to be managed; illegal and disorderly behavior must be managed, and even business losses need to be advised on how to survive. Chinese people are not used to living in organizations, love face, and hope to live with human warmth and a sense of belonging, right? The industrial and commercial office and the individual business association are your "hometown," although the material iron rice bowl is gone, spiritually, we will not let you be orphaned without a mother!

A released individual business owner, who didn't know how to do business and lost everything, was running around causing trouble everywhere. The industrial and commercial staff helped him analyze the market situation, guiding him to operate fruits according to the season, and he made a profit in a year. This man cried, saying: "I am convinced, I believe, you really treat me as a person, the party's warmth has reached my heart!" Another person selling clothes, pasting fake trademarks, evading taxes, doing underground transactions, was fined clean, had his license revoked, and went bankrupt. What is Chinese characteristics? This is one of them.

A certain street office's shop, together with the license and seal, was illegally rented to an unemployed person, who then rented it to a Tianjin resident named Wu, who was caught for hiring people to act as "stooges." His 47 rolls of cloth were temporarily seized pending decision. Wu's wife thought her family business was ruined and her life was over, writing a "hate" character on the wall with blood and taking an overdose of sleeping pills. Wu, in a fit of rage, threw the unconscious woman into the industrial and commercial bureau's office, creating a chaotic scene and injuring a kind-hearted staff member who tried to persuade him.

The beaten cadre, Tan Pingting, said: "Originally, we should have asked the police station to arrest him immediately!" But these kind-hearted people first thought of starting from humanitarianism, repaying evil with good, quickly sending the patient to the hospital for treatment, and saving the woman who was about to die. In the handling, they did not bear grudges, acting fairly and legally, purchasing the cloth at official prices and imposing an appropriate fine, leaving a way out for life. This individual business owner, after receiving the returned capital, felt deeply ashamed, bringing his whole family to apologize and express gratitude for the life-saving grace.

Those who sow thorns reap thorns, those who sow roses reap flowers. The right policy, sincere attitude, and reasonable supervision, in return, are conscience and reward. The black market foreign exchange case in the Imperial City Wall market was quickly solved in a very urgent situation, thanks to a woman selling goods who bravely provided clues. The industrial and commercial law enforcement team chased to the airport and seized a suspicious suitcase, catching the person with the goods, and found 41,000 yuan in black market foreign exchange coupons. At this time, there were only a dozen minutes left before takeoff.

How to view the individual business owners who have just emerged, there may be various different feelings, but from the perspective of morality, it should not be forgotten.

Bicycles and notebooks

There are many people in society who think that industrial and commercial work is a good job, fat and oily, seeing someone in uniform, saying "money uncle has come." On the street, punishing unlicensed peddlers often attracts the laughter of onlookers.

The seemingly elegant and simple Lu Bureau Chief smiled indifferently: "Just as there are a few worms in every industry, we also have. But I would like to make a statement, for example, confiscated money and goods must be turned over to the national treasury or entrusted to a bank for sale and accounting. Thinking that there are commissions in fines, and goods can be handled internally, is just a guess. Last year, 13,760 illegal cases were handled, 4.1 million yuan in fines and confiscations, 899 cars, 4,043 color TVs, 6,882 grams of gold... and we gained nothing, the average monthly bonus has always been around 30 yuan. As for a few worms, once discovered, we will not be lenient, demotion, expulsion, and even legal action. Clean governance is the most basic and most important professional ethics in our department.

"I'll just say one thing, a few college student cadres have already resigned and found other jobs because they have tasted the bitterness of low pay and dangerous duties here. The conditions are like this, bicycles and notebooks, calculators are not even popular, handling cases often means chasing cars with bicycles, traveling on business only staying in low-grade hotels and still having to pay for meals. Encountering desperate criminals, flashing a knife: 'I just got out of prison, three days before execution, you stinky industrial and commercial, not even a baton, looking for death, huh!' For these reasons, during the Spring Festival, I have to kowtow to the families of the staff..." He said.

Indeed! This reception room, which is also a meeting room, is more shabby than any other seen, with cabinets filled with instant noodles, and the cigarettes casually taken out by the interviewee, surprisingly, are only six or seven jiao per pack. Ah, our deepest respect to you, sentinels on the economic frontier!

    经济前线的哨兵
    中杰英　李德宏
    眼力雷达网
    北京东城工商局的检查哨上岗了。从广州开来的48次列车即将到达，出站口内厅悄然散立着头顶国徽、身穿浅灰蓝制服的人员。奉公守法的旅客也许从未感觉到他们的存在，然而一旦引起注意，便会发现帽沿下的每双眼睛都在隐隐发出非凡的透射力。
    “这位旅客，请等一下。”一位头发花白、微胖的中年检查员盯住了那个戴眼镜的细高挑青年人。折叠旅行车上两个大包，没错，洋烟，而且超量。
    问：“多少？”答：“50条。”“几个人的？”“5个人的。”“怎么都放在你的包里？”“我们一块儿去广州玩来着……”瘦高个把手一招，于是稀稀拉拉走拢来三男一女。检查员似乎在一瞬间判明了这5个人的关系，也可能是他们的某个动作细节走了样吧。
    “对不起，你们几位跟我来一趟。”
    瘦高个不由得一怔，借着大厅柱子的遮掩迅即从腰包里取出一把什么，像变戏法般递过去，喃喃地陪笑。
    “小伙子，钓鱼得到河里去，这儿可没有。”检查员在严肃的神态中透出一丝幽默。
    罗剑之，原解放军某部营长，转业到东城区工商局北京检查站，上岗不过半年。在这里可不论官品大小全都站岗放哨，站长也不例外。早上来的时候便正好赶上老站长任福林在电视机上快速验查可疑的录相带，按规定这活儿只由他独自一人关起门来“承包”，累得手忙脚乱。外头有人说他们没收来的录相带自己看足了，任福林笑了一声：“没有那号事！瞧这一大堆，苦差事，眼睛快长疮了……”
    还是说罗剑之吧，把人带到办公室，先请进来那个女的，包头某服装厂厂长。大概是交出来的工作证让这位国家干部脸红了，随即和盘托出，原来是人家在火车上便宜卖给她10条洋烟，小恩小惠换来了4个陌生人的掩护。案子办得干脆利索，无关人员全部放行，就只扣下那个瘦高个。检视结果，两大包内藏有匕首2把，淫秽扑克牌18副，旧服装20件，无发票服装4打，外烟40条。当然不能漏掉贴身围着的那个宝贝腰包，掏出金戒指18枚，总重99克；小挎包里还有某出版社发行的《艳女杀手》和《性生活夜话》各一册。
    小伙子傻了，目瞪口呆，脸色煞白。“我……头一回，一万多块钱呐！”那家伙快要哭了。“年轻轻的玩这买卖，嗯……把过程写出来，看看态度。”
    其实真正令人佩服的还是罗剑之的“态度”，对这件五毒俱全的大案和铤而走险的违法分子，始终心平气和，讲求政策而不失长者之风。据他说，北京唯一设置的这处工商检查站，每天有所缴获，对从沿海开放地区过来的客车，尤其要睁大警惕的眼睛。
    这是另一双警惕的眼睛，明亮、犀利之中透着秀气。刚晋升的女副站长王青，27岁，身段修长，才貌出众。尽管请她发表谈话时显得腼腆为难，然而上岗执法，行动泼辣，口齿伶俐，仿佛变成了另一个人。她今天截住一名东北人，私运两台无发票的日本录相机，带仓里可能还夹带了“黄货”，正在接通电源把带子退出来交站长检查。
    王青练出了相当准确的判断力，有一次一名打扮入时的女客大模大样地从面前走过，看来很平常，可是行李不大平常，篮子里只有几包饼干和几罐饮料。从广州回来谁不带着大包小包的俏货，为何只有她这般轻装省力呢？是呀，干工商检查这行起码也得是半个福尔摩斯，善于逻辑推理，脑快眼灵，从乱哄哄的人流中迅速认定可疑对象，否则机会稍纵即逝。
    “请问，到哪儿去了？”“到珠海去了。”“就带回来这点东西……”王青掂掂那个篮子，沉重异常。拨开浮面上的饼干，露出一个布包，裹了好几层。打开一看，内藏250只金戒指，总重1500克。
    “大姐，”那女人低声哀求，“放了我吧，咱们一人一半。”
    “这东西烫手呀，我不敢要……”王青只是淡然一笑。处理结果是严肃而公平合理的，大部没收，其余按官价收购。至于为什么这样处理，计算方式比较复杂，就不在这里说了。
    妇女作案，利用人们的怜悯与同情，也是眼下的一种“新潮”。由女检查员对付她们，自然有方便之处。王青不久前与另一位检查员配合抓住一个女的，身材瘦削，提着小包行走自若，从外表和姿态几乎看不出破绽。只是打个照面，一瞬间那眼神幽幽然似有意闪避。于是请到检查站，便露出了原形。这女人的腰上、腿上和胯下缠带进口手表与打火机共400多只，价值5万余元。据交代她是被雇佣的二传手，因为体型苗条，易于夹藏私货而不显臃肿，这也许是走私者的一招新戏法。
    王青不无自豪地说，前几年发生的沈阳与营口邮车寄烟大案，也是她们协办的。她曾盯住一位老太太，从箱子里仅查出少量外烟，可是那人却下意识地捂住随身的小手袋，这莫非是暗渡陈仓之计？果然从袋里找到150多张包裹邮单，每张以不同的人名偷寄香烟300余条。据老站长介绍说，王青还查获过批量500把的匕首和弹簧刀等等违禁品……“她的眼力能顶一部雷达！”站长笑道。
    然而，谁能想到这位女检查员要承受多么沉重的负荷呢，上有老下有小，上早班提前到4点多钟起床迎接火车到站。常常一口气顶到天黑，中午仅以十几分钟享用方便面或者干面包。
    “我对这号工作有一种快感，干一行练一行么……”瞧，她说得倒是挺轻松的。
    马润海，是检查站最年轻，也是同事们引以为荣的人物。先进工作者、新长征突出手、优秀党员，头衔真不少，可看不出他只有24岁，体质虚弱还要照顾多病的父母和困难的家庭。倔强的小伙子一面上业余大学，一面屡建奇功。
    从北京去哈尔滨的列车即将开动，一名年轻妇女携带包装纸箱匆忙进站。某个细节反常——违法者即便是天才演员也掩饰不了心理的失衡！
    “请问带的什么？”“报纸，杂志……。”奇怪，谁会费力气去搬运只有废纸价值的旧报刊，这女人并不像个学者！揭开表层的伪装，露出72盒录相带，美国的、日本的、北欧的，全是3X级性片。
    还遇到过一个刁滑死硬的刑满释放分子，被查获贩私手表500余块。逃跑未成便耍赖皮，哀叫损失太大，躺倒不活了，活了也要回来玩命。又有一个倒卖录相机的，软泡硬磨，口称“大哥开恩一次”，趁旁边没人递过买路钱，一再增添价码。像这种只有天知地知的秘密试探，马润海接触过不计其数，要真收下也“发”了。也许对他来说拒贿并不难，难在并不因为年轻而意气用事，他的拿手好戏叫“查得严密，罚得有理，惩教结合，攻心为上”。正是由于高明的精神战略，许多闯关者服了，讲出内情，扩大了战果。一年之内他查出违法案件747起，千元以上大案23件，罚没款19万余元。而付出的代价是出勤356天，加班187次，每天的时间表，安排下来只有5—6小时的睡眠！
    检查站里，成天哭的、闹的、骂大街的、伪装老实的、捶胸顿足的，喜怒哀乐之相无奇不有，几乎每个作案人都是一幕惊险戏剧。从这里能发现官家与私家合伙蒙骗，假发票与冒牌货一同滚动，还能看到绝望自伤、服毒撞头、被送往医院抢救的破产者与亡命徒。当然更多的人是撞过南墙，启蒙了法盲脑袋，此后改邪归正了。然而这间内涵丰富的房子，实在简陋得不像样，铁皮钢架临时拼接，人流杂沓，拥塞喧嚣，夏天闷得头昏，冬天冷得要命。真亏得这些神经坚强的工商哨兵们，就在这里天天苦炼岁月啊。
    “要说一年办案几千起，上交国库近百万元，数目不太大。可是往大门口一站，代表国家经济秩序，防范并查处了许多犯罪活动，让那些本打算以身试法的人们知险而退。试想一想，假如缺了这道闸门，那会是个什么样……”看来，任福林站长的话更富有哲理性。
    在权势与渎法者面前
    马克·吐温说，法律好比蜘蛛网，能捉住小虫子，可是大鸟一闯就过去了。火车站的“虫子”自然是比不了以权势为翅膀的“大鸟”，但是工商法规这面网子又是否那么容易闯过去呢？北京流行的顺口溜说：老百姓干一辈子，个体户干一阵子，赛不过官倒爷干一下子。又说：官倒无定义，法律有缺口，费劲查半年，自有神仙救。究竟事实真相又如何呢？“价格双轨制铺开，以权换钱和条子生财的新行业开始大行其市，到1988年已是‘空前繁荣’。”企业监督科的负责干部带着一丝苦笑说，“为了给自身以及职工谋利，公司与企业法人参与投机倒把的为数不少。为此我们设立了经济检查科和企业监督科，专门与‘大鸟’们周旋，其复杂与艰难的程度，局外人难以想像……”
    请先试看一只由蛋孵出来的鸟怎样落网。河北枣强县一家本小利微的国营机电公司，在汽车倒卖浪潮中也做起了发财梦，偶识北京某街道怀才不遇的小业务员任宁宁，居然托他搞到一辆平价车，于是立即开设驻京营业部。自我任命的任经理为了瞒天过海以图大业，竟将执照上的经营项目“汽车仓储”字样，在“汽车”后面私自加了一个顿号，由此一点值千金，变成了“汽车、仓储”逃过了不明底的审查者，小小货栈便升格为冠冕堂皇的官办汽车行了。
    任宁宁借了这块牌子翻江倒海，一路绿灯。先把枣强县派来的财务监督人员招安过来；而后以物质上贡地方官，在北京郊区某乡建立游击根据地；最终瞄准了理想的靶标——北京机电公司机械设备分公司经理卞六全。为了猎获这家拥有大量平价汽车的特号大户，他押下大赌注，盗用营业部名义，实则自掏腰包，凡对方受限制的集团消费项目，会议、旅游、吃喝、乃至运动服、BB机等，一律义务报销。又以高价购进美元特供炒汇，并用10万元的高级轿车交换3万元的旧车以示情谊。难怪那个特号大户亲昵地唤道：“宁宁啊，你真好……”
    好到什么地步，货源、资金、账号、各种有利可图的业务，让其随意包揽，设备分公司俨然成了人家的“全活保姆”，那个县办的“小卖部”实际上已发展为华北地下汽车贸易中心。任宁宁的皮包里塞满了合同、契约、货单、空白驾驶执照、外汇期票、海关证件，全国除西藏、台湾之外，各省市均建立热线联络，流通额动辄以百万元计。
    等发现那个一点值千金的顿号的袖里乾坤，难题落到了并非最初审批开业的东城区。由于牵涉到本市商业大户和诸般公共关系以及外县地方本位的保护，案内有机巧，案外有干扰，令人望而生畏。单说某局的“合作态度”：“请查吧，账单两大桌，后面还有两屋子，有能耐查去好了！”专门请来的两位会计师不禁抽一口冷气，假若按照常规方法彻底弄清那些数字的来龙去脉，需要两三年；即便查明无进货单的200余辆汽车下落，全科人员出动也要半年以上。然而奇迹出现了，经济检查科的张爱东泰然笑道：“他们算计错了，干经济检查这一行也不是好欺负的！不是有部电影叫《智取华山》吗，你有办法设置路障，我有办法抄近道，你搞官官相护，我还有个依靠组织、发动群众呐。具体细节不必转述，免得让别的蛀虫摸了底去。当然我们也多吃了不少苦，和公安部门一起拉着那个任宁宁‘周游世界’，每天跑几百里路。到了地方不宜吃请，还得自己掏钱给他买饭，让他有点‘积极性’。案子办下来，我们倒也得了一点意外收获：减肥效果显著。”
    查实结果，不到一年倒卖汽车528辆，其中北京销出363辆，总款额921万元，非法牟利38万余元。最后各经营单位及个人被罚没款共80万元，一干人犯进了公检法，满以为能闯过去的大小鸟儿们傻眼了。
    “须知社会主义的中国不实行金元政治，大商号也买不到治外法权！”张爱东这样说。
    另一桩汽车案虽不算太复杂，但比任宁宁更具空中优势。内蒙古物资局北京采购站，办照时限定经营范围仅为本地区的采购服务。未料以特殊照顾名义购入紧俏商品，两年中买进汽车500余辆，只有81辆销往本区，每辆只获微利1.11元，岂非傻瓜？原来意不在此，其余400多辆倒给全国各省，经单据作弊任意加码，得利56万元之巨，同时还倒卖彩电、冰箱、录相机又非法获利约3万元。案发后说客盈门，是否该查，诸多部门莫衷一是，竟把人情做到当时的国家副主席那里去了。幸而副主席明察秋毫，当即表示支持查办，反对投机倒把，愤愤然敲着手杖将求情者轰出大门。尽管碰了钉子，那个物资局还是派人来要求多多关照，希望偃旗息鼓私下了结。执法者凛然忠告他们：王法大于人情，打出谁的旗号也无济于事。此案结局是没收其非法所得59万余元并向公众公布案情，有关人等依律法办！
    与汽车热的同时还兴起彩电热。体型小巧的家用电器，经营分散，来去无踪，侦查更加困难。去年某日一处正在卸货，形迹可疑，于是顺藤摸瓜，没想到走入了迷魂阵。费九牛二虎之力才弄清一张马拉松联络图：原始售出单位厦门青盛公司，趸给北京城乡贸易中心，中心又将其部分过手给京鹏公司收取“咨询费”，另一部分则倒给华大公司，华大又批给凌云公司，凌云又卖给燕云公司……好长的名单哟！而为了逃避检查，聪明的老板们在进货之始即注入反检查因素，彩色电视机变成了科仪“放像设备”或“监视器”，预先设放烟幕弹以掩护撤退。这批宝物经过“商品大旅游，价格滚雪球”，每台由1900元涨到2900元，中间盘剥共20万元被瓜分而去。不承担任何商业风险，不付出任何劳务代价，“官倒”者，官盗是也！
    一位工商干部讲，像这一类的官倒案在漫长而曲折的连续剧中大都要演出典型的三部曲。一曰“顶”：拒绝调查，找上级主管不接待，传经办人员不到场，明知你工商部门无权扣人，何所惧哉。二曰“赖”：躲起来捉迷藏，互相踢皮球，拖你半个世纪，让你筋疲力尽，徒呼奈何。三曰“求”：实在搪不过去，子弟搬兵，亲友说情，请客送礼，低声下气，从一条好烟到金银货币，从东来顺到马克西姆，吃点小亏仍可占下大便宜。“不过，在我们这里，”这位干部说，“诸种法术失灵，连续剧的最后一集必是没收全部非法所得再加罚款或者进法院。一些后台颇硬的小爷儿们被割得肉疼，也未敢反抗，只灰溜溜地骂一句‘真他妈的孙子’了事。”
    要说来头更大的，是涉及M界的各类公司。一家业务范围为提供海外商业信息的集体企业，被查出违法经营生产资料。经手该案的负责人讲述道——
    取证查实的第一回合给来了个下马威，常务副经理宣称：“一概绝密，没有提供资料的义务！”第二回合，该公司上级主管发话“请”工商局长前去“会见”，自定接访时间接近开饭钟点，其意不言自明，幸而局长婉言拒谢。第三回合又变一招，提供不符事实的材料把水搅浑，反复申述他们的“业务特殊性”，说“没赚钱，赚了钱也是给公家的”……等等。
    我正告他，不把事情说清，可有三条出路：一、冻结账号，你们立时停业；二、诉诸舆论，公布你的案情；三、移送给你的上级纪委处理，你可能受到双重处分。我还给他讲了一个先例，也属M界的某文化站倒卖彩电，工商部门前去检查，连眼皮也不抬，态度比你还横。对不起，我们将所搜集到的证据发函给他的上级纪委，结果内部通报严处。
    那位傲慢的副经理这下毛了，怕官司打上去毁了自家前程，第二天即提供真实案情，随后并到本局表示道歉，交出非法所得6.5万元。
    “由此可见还要相信一句老话：邪不压正。”那位办案人说，“在权势面前不能害怕，越怕越受欺负。只有渎法者才是真正的心虚害怕！”
    其实对付这类尚有资财实力的官倒，只要一身正气，并不十分难治。最叫头痛的，是那些七拼八凑的皮包公司。提起前几年的经商热，雨后春笋般生出来一堆先天不足的畸胎，待清理整顿伊始，便尝到了苦果的滋味。
    通桥贸易公司经理王益民，分文无有，虚报资金立照起家，与全国各地签订合同供应“影子彩电”1.9万台，诈得预付金316.5万元，其中竟有20万是唐山地震残疾灾民的经营自救经费。这个骗子花天酒地胡乱挥霍，待西洋镜拆穿遁逃无踪，公司人员装傻充愣，可急煞了各路贪便宜的冤大头。在此关键时刻，工商局会同公安部门当机立断，将最先挖出的欠款提前归还唐山，灾民们感动得热泪如雨。诈骗犯10余人先后无一漏网。
    “可以负责地讲，”企业监督科的同志说，“我们管界内的不少公司确实存在程度不等的问题，在已抽查的195家中查处了94家。应当承认，强大的威慑作用已使违法活动大为减少。但有一种苗头值得注意，所谓财务脱钩，辞去一头，往往只走过场；明脱暗不脱，人辞利不辞，仍然依附原主管部门的特权生存。我们想呼吁的是，不能指靠短期政策，而应制订稳定的、完备的、刚性的法规，不叫投机者有空子可钻。”
    形形色色的个体户
    “我们是执法者，更重要的，是服务员和宣传员，要把人的工作做在前面。”市场管理所的一位所长说。
    漫步在王府井、皇城根、东华门、隆福寺和东单的日夜市场，繁华、喧闹、摩肩接踵，紊乱中又似乎体现着某种无形的制约而条理井然。这些俗称的所谓自由市场，靠什么来维系商品经济中自由与秩序的平衡呢？他说：“我们把集贸市场看作是公开亮相的经济展览会，在相当程度上也代表了地方形象。人们对某个城镇甚至某个国家的第一印象，往往不就是从逛大街得来的吗。”
    为了建设文明市场，他们想过很多办法，还曾请来老龄委员会一些会武术的把式协助管理，倒是一丝不苟，敢罚敢抄。没想到治服一个刺儿头，又跑出来三个滚刀肉，越治越乱。后来品出味了，尽管是为商重利，买卖如战场，商贩们总归还是有灵性的普通人吧。这才进一步领悟到应当改善管理宗旨，以说服教育配合经济处罚，让他们体验到工作人员是来护理他们的，只有合法经营才是最保险的生财之道。效果如何呢，某国大使馆就在某片市场旁边，他们出来买东西时一看，觉得中国的经济改革放而不乱，统而不死，确实很有特色。
    此处150多个摊位中一部分摊主有刑事前科，还有不少精神空白的“自由民”。家庭不和要管，结婚离婚也管；计划生育，联系治病，大人小孩上学，管；违法乱纪当然更得管，甚至买卖失利也给参谋如何自救生存。中国人不是习惯于生活在组织之中，爱好面子，希望活得有人情味和归属感吗？工商所和个体协会就是你们的“娘家”，物质上的铁饭碗没有了，但是精神上决不让你们当没娘的孤儿！
    从大牢出来的一名个体户，不会做买卖赔光了，到处乱窜胡闹。工商人员帮他分折市场行情，引导他按时令经营瓜果，一年便赚回来了。这个汉子哭了，说：“我服了，我信了，你们真把我当人，党的温暖送到了心上！”另一名卖服装的，贴假商标，偷税漏税，搞地下交易，被罚个精光，吊销执照，破产收摊了。什么是中国特色？这就是其一。
    某街道办事处经营的一家商店，连同执照和公章非法租给无业人员，又转租给天津居民吴某，因雇人做“托儿”被查处，暂扣其47匹布料待决。吴某之妻以为就此毁了家业断绝生路，用血在屋壁上写了一个恨字，服下超量利眠宁。吴某冲动起来，将昏迷中的女人扔到工商局办公室，疯狂吵闹，当场打伤好心劝解的工作人员。
    被殴打的干部檀平亭讲：“本来我们应当请派出所立即把他抓起来！”但是这些好心人首先想到的是从人道主义出发，以德报怨，赶紧将病人送进医院，尽心护理，把那个垂死的女人救活了。在处理时他们又不计前嫌，秉公依法以官价收购布匹，课以适当罚款，留给生活出路。这位个体户拿到发还的本钱，深感羞愧，带着全家前来认错，感激救命之恩。
    种蒺藜者得刺，种玫瑰者得花。对路的政策，真诚的态度，合乎情理的监管，换来的是良知和回报。皇城根市场炒汇大案，便是在时间十分紧迫的情势下，由一位摆摊的妇女冒险提供线索得以迅速破获的。工商执法队追到飞机场扣下可疑皮箱，人赃俱获，查出黑市外汇券4.1万元，此时离登机起飞仅差十几分钟。
    怎样看待问世不久的个体户们，可有各种不同的感受，但是道义的角度，恐怕不应遗忘。
    自行车加笔记本
    社会上有不少人以为，工商是份美差，肥得流油，见了穿制服的，说“钱爷来了”。在街上处罚无照小贩，还经常招来围观者的哄笑。
    显得很斯文朴素的陆局长不觉淡然一笑道：“就像任何行业里都有少量蛀虫一样，我们也有。不过也想发表一点声明，比如罚没钱物，必须上缴国库或者交委托行作价出售归账。以为罚款中有提成，物品可以内部处理，只是瞎猜而已。去年处理违法案13760起，罚没款410万元，查处汽车899辆，彩电4043台，黄金6882克……而我们毫无所得，平均月奖金一直是30元左右。至于少数蛀虫，一经发现绝不客气，记过、除名直到法办。为政清廉是我们这个部门最起码的，也是最注重的职业品德。
    “我只说一件事，有几位大学生干部已经辞职而去另觅高就，因为他们在我这里尝够了待遇菲薄、公务艰险的苦头。条件就是这样，自行车加笔记本，连计算器还不普及，办案子经常就是用自行车追汽车，出差只能住低档旅馆还得搭饭钱。遇上亡命徒把刀子一亮：‘老子刚从大牢出来，差三天就枪毙，你臭工商连警棍也不趁，找死呐！’为了这些，春节拜年我要先给职工家属磕三个头……”
    信乎其言！这间会客室，也是会议室，比已见到过的都更简陋，柜橱里放着方便面，被采访者无意中掏出来的香烟，竟是六七角钱一包的。啊，向你们深致敬意，经济前线的哨兵们！
