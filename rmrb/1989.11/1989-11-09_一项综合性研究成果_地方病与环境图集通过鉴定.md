People's Daily, Beijing, November 8th - Reporter Xie Lianhui reports: The scientifically rich "Atlas of Endemic Diseases and Environment of the People's Republic of China" has passed the review by the Chinese Academy of Sciences at the departmental level today. This atlas, compiled over a decade, embodies the collective wisdom of more than a hundred scientists and researchers from over 40 units, including the Institute of Geography of the Academy. It is a major interdisciplinary research achievement that spans multiple departments and disciplines.

Endemic diseases in China affect and threaten the health of over 400 million people. Their occurrence is directly related to the imbalance between human health and the ecological environment in certain specific regions. Over the past few decades, China has conducted extensive investigations, observations, prevention, and research in the fields of endemic disease prevention and treatment, etiology, and ecological environment, accumulating a wealth of first-hand data.

This atlas is a monumental work in medical geography, representing the latest integrated achievements in medicine, geology, biology, and cartography.
