On September 7th, I visited eight mid-to-high-end restaurants in the urban area of Changzhou, including "Xinglongyuan," "Ronghualou," and "Bailè." These restaurants, which were once bustling with business, are now experiencing a significant drop in customers. This decline is reportedly due to the strict crackdown on extravagant banquets and the overall economic downturn faced by enterprises.

On the morning of September 8th, I visited a company where a subsidiary's department was opening. During the celebratory event, the host repeatedly insisted on treating the guests to a simple meal. Thus, I joined the group to a newly renovated company cafeteria located deep in a narrow alley. The cafeteria was serene and elegantly decorated, rivaling high-end hotels. When the dishes arrived, the first course was a 24-inch large platter filled with saltwater prawns, saltwater duck, seaweed, braised fish, and beef slices—six different dishes. Following that, eight more large bowls, each containing two high-end dishes, were served. This "simple meal" consisted of 22 different dishes and one bowl of soup. After the meal, the host humbly said, "The cafeteria is new, and the culinary skills are not yet refined. Please come again after our chefs receive further training."

On September 12th, I was invited to a meeting at a township-run factory in Wujin County. The meeting was brief, with over ten representatives in attendance. However, when it came time to eat, the small cafeteria on the second floor was fully occupied with four tables. The revolving tray was laden with various cold dishes, and boxes of beer were placed underneath. A middle-aged man raised his voice, saying, "Given the host's generosity, we have no choice but to eat first and discuss later." Thus, the dozens of guests raised their glasses and drank heartily. I lost count of the number of dishes served, but when a platter of braised eel was presented, a guest burped and said, "If I hadn't attended a banquet yesterday, today's meal would be even more enjoyable."

Recently, I visited a factory in the city. At noon, the factory director accompanied me to the cafeteria for a meal consisting of two dishes and one soup. It seemed that the banqueting culture had truly been curbed here. However, after the director left, a friend who works as a supply clerk in the factory told me, "Now, the factory has shifted its banquets to out-of-town locations. Just the other day, they booked a small guesthouse outside the city and entertained clients from various regions for three days."

It appears that while high-end restaurants are experiencing a decline in business, many industrial and mining enterprises' small cafeterias are quietly thriving. According to a staff member from the Changzhou Culinary Training Center, nearly 98% of the recent trainees are from enterprise cafeterias.

    大饭店生意清淡　快想办法
    小食堂客人盈门　另有文章
    9月7日中午，我走访了常州市区“兴隆园”、“荣华楼”、“百乐”等8家高中档餐馆，看到这些前些时生意兴隆的餐馆现在却门庭冷落。据说，这是由于狠刹吃喝风和企业效益不景气所致。
    9月8日上午10时，我来到一家公司，正逢这家公司下属的一家经营部开张，喜庆之际，主人一再关照，要留来客吃顿便饭。于是，我便随同一行来到了设在小巷深处新装修的公司小食堂。这个小食堂，环境幽静，其内部装饰不亚于高级饭店。上菜了，第一道上了只24寸大拼盆，满满地堆着盐水虾、盐水鸭、海蜇、煲鱼、牛肉片等6种菜肴，接着又上了8盆各装有两种高档菜肴的大盆。这顿便饭，实质上吃了22种菜，一盆汤。吃完后，主人谦虚地说：“新开食堂，手艺不好，待培训了厨师，再欢迎光临。”
    9月12日，我应邀来到了武进县一家乡办工厂参加会议，会议简短，10多位代表。可到吃饭时，二楼的小食堂整整4桌坐无虚席，转盘台上放满了各种冷盘，台下放着整箱啤酒。一位中年人亮着嗓门说：“各位，主人这么盛情，咱们只好先吃后检讨了。”于是，数十人频频举杯，开怀畅饮。也不知上了多少道菜了，当上到一盆红烧鳗鱼时，一位客人打了个饱嗝说：“要是昨天不参加酒宴，今天这顿饭就更有味道了。”
    日前，我到市一家工厂，中午12时，厂长陪我进食堂吃了顿两菜一汤。看来，这里的吃喝风真正刹住了。可等厂长一走，一位在厂里当供销员的朋友对我说：“现在厂里已把请吃转移到了外地。前几天，还在外地包了个小招待所，对各地客户招待了3天。”
    看来，在大饭店生意清淡的同时，许多工矿企业的小食堂正在悄悄地热闹起来。据常州市厨师培训中心人反映，近期送来培训的，98％是工矿企业的食堂人员。
