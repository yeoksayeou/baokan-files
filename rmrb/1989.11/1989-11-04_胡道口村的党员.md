	The Party Members of Hudaokou Village

	In Hudaokou Village of Zhaxia Township in our county, the village was originally very poor, with an average annual income of less than 120 yuan per person and an average annual grain ration of less than 100 kilograms per person. However, the situation has changed dramatically. According to last year's statistics, there are 15 households in the village with an annual income of over 10,000 yuan, and 53 households with an annual income of over 5,000 yuan, making it one of the famous rich villages in our county. When asked about the process of becoming wealthy, the villagers all praise the Communist Party members and the village secretary.

	According to the local natural conditions, if Hudaokou Village wants to become wealthy, it must develop enterprises. In 1983, the village Party branch secretary, Liu Hanbang, took out the money he had saved for building a house and for his daughter's dowry, and led 12 households he had contacted to raise 800,000 yuan to build a rotary kiln factory.

	Subsequently, the village committee member and village head, Dai Juwang, and the Party members Zhou Shiyong and Zhou Shoudong, respectively, established coal briquette processing plants and furniture factories with the households they had contacted. The old Party member Zhou Shicai, with the support of the Party branch, led 4 households to use the 1,300 mu of abandoned riverbank in the village, raised 1.3 million yuan, and built a 16-chamber rotary kiln factory. That year, they achieved a production value of 3.5 million yuan and a profit of 500,000 yuan.

	Under the leadership of Liu Hanbang, all 63 Party members in the village led their contact households to raise funds and establish economic cooperatives for grain processing, furniture production, and other industries. In just four years, the number of enterprises established by Party members grew to 11, with a total production value of 9.05 million yuan, a profit of 1.3575 million yuan, and tax payments of 1.15 million yuan. Currently, 78% of the village's labor force is engaged in industrial work, greatly promoting the adjustment of the village's industrial structure.

	Seeing the changes in Hudaokou Village, Liu Hanbang realized that there were still some villagers who were relatively poor and needed the Party branch to "give them a helping hand." Liu Hanbang said at a branch meeting, "As a Communist Party member, one should be willing to earn less oneself in order to lead the people to the road of common prosperity."

	During the autumn sowing season last year, Liu Hanbang saw that most farmers lacked fertilizer and could not plant, so he went to Huaiyin City to buy 20 tons of ammonium bicarbonate and distributed it to the villagers, solving their immediate problem. Following his example, the branch leadership did everything possible to help the villagers become wealthy and solve their difficulties. The branch member and village accountant, Zhou Shoudong, established a furniture processing plant with the households he had contacted. When he learned that two households wanted to establish a factory but had financial difficulties, he voluntarily transferred the factory to them, not only charging no transfer fee but also giving them a discount of 1,400 yuan. Then he contacted three more households and established another wood processing plant.

	In 1985, there were 34 households in the village with an average annual income of less than 250 yuan. By 1986, all of them had escaped poverty, and by 1988, the average annual income was over 600 yuan.

    胡道口村的党员
    我县扎下乡胡道口村，原来很穷，人均年收入不到120元，人均年口粮不足100公斤。如今却大变了样。据去年统计，全村年收入万元以上的15户，5000元以上的53户，成为我县有名的富村之一。问起致富经过，群众都夸奖村里的共产党员和支书。
    根据当地的自然条件，胡道口村要想富，就要发展企业。1983年，党支部书记刘汉帮把自家准备盖房子和给女儿出嫁打家具的钱拿出来，带领他联系的12户群众，集资8万元，建起了一座轮窑厂。
    接着，村支委、村长戴举旺和党员周士勇、周守东分别和联户群众办起了煤球加工厂、木器厂。老党员周士才在党支部的支持下，带领4户群众，利用本村的1300亩废河滩，自筹资金13万元，建起了一座十六门轮窑厂。当年实现产值35万元，利润5万元。
    在刘汉帮的带领下，全村63名党员纷纷带领自己的联系户筹资，兴办了粮食加工、家具生产等经济联合体，短短4年时间，由党员办起来的企业发展到11个，共创产值905万元，实现利润135.75万元，上缴税利11.5万元。目前，全村从工劳力占所有劳力总数的78％，大大促进了村里产业结构的调整。
    面对胡道口村的变化，刘汉帮发现还有一部分群众比较贫困，需要支部“拉一把”。刘汉帮在支部会上说，作为一名共产党员，宁可自己少收入一些，也要带领群众走共同富裕的道路。
    去年秋播期间，刘汉帮看到大多数农户缺化肥无法下种，自己到淮阴市购回20吨碳铵，分给群众，解决了群众的当务之急。在他的带动下，支委一班人千方百计为群众致富排忧解难。支委、村会计周守东联户办起木器加工厂，当他了解到两户群众想办厂资金有困难时，主动将这个厂转让给他们，不但未收一分钱手续费，还让利1400元，然后又联系3户重新办起了一个木材加工厂。
    1985年，全村人均收入250元以下的贫困户34户，到1986年全部脱了贫，1988年，人均收入600元以上。
