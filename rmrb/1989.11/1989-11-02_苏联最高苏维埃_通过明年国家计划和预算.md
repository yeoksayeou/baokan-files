Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 31st.

The Soviet Supreme Soviet's two chambers held a two-day heated discussion and on the 31st approved the 1990 state plan and budget by a majority vote.

The plan stipulates that the national total output value for next year will increase by 2.3% compared to 1989. The growth rate of consumer goods should be 12 times faster than that of means of production, in order to somewhat alleviate the tense situation in the consumer market this year. To improve the living standards of the people, the state will allocate a special fund of 13.4 billion rubles, which is 40% more than the originally planned amount. At the same time, productive investments will be reduced by 1/4, and some sectors will be reduced by 40%. Except for the light industry, food, and building materials sectors, new projects will be restricted as much as possible. Additionally, 650 million foreign exchange rubles will be allocated to import raw materials for light industry and other sectors, while reducing oil exports by 3.8 million tons to meet domestic demand. Furthermore, 50% of the military industry's production should be civilian products next year.

The budget for next year aims to improve the financial situation, reduce all unnecessary expenditures, and increase revenue as much as possible. The budget stipulates that revenue will be 429.9 billion rubles, expenditures will be 489.9 billion rubles, and the deficit will be 60 billion rubles, which is half of this year's planned financial deficit. The defense expenditure for 1990 will be 70.9 billion rubles, a reduction of 6.4 billion rubles from this year.

Soviet Supreme Soviet Chairman Gorbachev said at the meeting, "We have passed a very difficult and tense plan and budget. Although we are not satisfied, we can only do so much, because this plan is based on the actual situation." He believes that to achieve this plan, people should work as hard as they did during the war years and the first few years after the war.

    苏联最高苏维埃
    通过明年国家计划和预算
    新华社莫斯科10月31日电  苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议经过两天的激烈讨论，31日以多数票通过1990年国家计划和预算。
    计划规定，明年的国民总产值比1989年增长2.3％，消费品的增长速度应比生产资料的增长快12倍，以便能在某种程度上缓解今年消费市场的紧张状况。为了提高人民的生活水平，国家将专门拨款134亿卢布，这比最初规定的数额增加40％。与此同时，生产性投资将减少1／4，有的部门则要减少40％。除轻工、食品和建材部门外，将尽可能限制新开工项目。还将增拨6.5亿外汇卢布进口轻工等原料，同时减少出口石油380万吨，以满足国内的需求。此外，明年军事工业生产的民用产品应占全部产值的50％。
    明年的预算将以健全财政状况为目标，减少一切不必要的开支，并尽量增加收入。预算规定收入为4299亿卢布，支出为4899亿卢布，赤字为600亿卢布，比今年计划的财政赤字减少1／2。1990年的国防费用为709亿卢布，比今年减少64亿卢布。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席戈尔巴乔夫在会上说，“我们通过了非常困难和紧张的计划和预算。虽然我们并不满意，但只能到此为止，因为这项计划是根据现实情况制订的。”他认为，为了实现这个计划，应该像战争年代和战后头几年那样艰苦工作。
