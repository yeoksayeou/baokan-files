Recently, in the coal city of Liuzhi Special District, Guizhou Province, a story has been circulating about a young man who bravely jumped into water to rescue a drowning child. He is Luo Jiayong, a 15-year-old student in the ninth grade at the Liuzhi Coal Machinery Factory Affiliated School.

On the afternoon of October 26, around 6 PM, a 5-year-old boy named Chen Cheng was playing by the water's edge and accidentally fell into a pool over two meters deep. Luo Jiayong, who had just returned home from school, heard the cries for help and immediately jumped into the water. He swam over and, with the assistance of adults who had rushed to the scene, pulled Chen Cheng out of the water. Luo Jiayong, soaked to the skin, dragged the unconscious Chen Cheng to the hospital and stayed until the child was out of danger.

Luo Jiayong is usually a diligent student who follows the rules and often does good deeds for his classmates quietly. He is a model student in both academics and conduct.

    贵州少年罗家勇跳水救人不顾身
    新华社贵阳11月8日电　（通讯员学佳）最近，在贵州省煤城六枝特区，流传着一位少年奋不顾身抢救落水儿童的事迹。他是六盘水煤机厂子弟学校初三班15岁的罗家勇。
    10月26日下午6时许，5岁小男孩陈诚在水塘边玩水，不慎跌入两米多深的水池中。刚放学回家的罗家勇路过这里，听到呼救声，便跳进水中，游了过去，在赶来的大人们的协助下，把陈诚救上了岸。罗家勇拖着湿淋淋的身子，把昏迷的陈诚送进医院，直到孩子脱离危险。
    罗家勇平时在学校学习刻苦，遵守纪律，经常默默无闻地给班里做好事，是一个品学兼优的好学生。
