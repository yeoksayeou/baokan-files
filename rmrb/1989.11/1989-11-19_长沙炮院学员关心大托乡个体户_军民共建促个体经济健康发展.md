Students from the 13th Platoon of Changsha Artillery Academy have been working with the Datuo Township Individual Laborers Association to build socialist spiritual civilization and promote the healthy development of the individual economy.

Datuo Township is located on the outskirts of Changsha City. There are 482 individual industrial and commercial households and 927 people engaged in individual labor. In the past, there were instances of tax evasion, cheating customers, and other malpractices among individual laborers. Since 1984, when the military-civilian joint construction began, the 13th Platoon of Changsha Artillery Academy has actively introduced the army's management experience to the Individual Laborers Association and helped them implement democratic management. The township association established inspection and evaluation teams, tax assessment and collection teams, public security patrols, and comprehensive management teams, and implemented a system of responsibilities and target management, changing the previous chaotic situation.

The military-civilian joint construction focuses on vocational ethics education and addresses common problems faced by individual laborers. The 13th Platoon assisted the association in holding seven rule-making training classes, with over 85% of individual laborers participating in the training. They also organized vocational ethics lectures, evaluation meetings, and thematic competitions.

The military-civilian joint construction activities have enhanced the legal awareness and sense of social responsibility among individual laborers. Since last year, there have been no illegal incidents among the individual households under the township association. In September of this year, during a tax inspection in the Changsha region, all individual households under the Datuo Township Association were rated as law-abiding operators.

    长沙炮院学员关心大托乡个体户
    军民共建促个体经济健康发展
    本报讯　长沙炮兵学院学员十三队与大托乡个体劳动者协会共建社会主义精神文明，促进个体经济健康发展。
    大托乡地处长沙市郊，个体工商户482户，从业人员927人。过去，个体从业人员中偷税漏税、坑害顾客等现象时有发生。1984年开展军民共建以来，长沙炮兵学院学员十三队主动向个体劳动者协会介绍部队的管理经验，并帮助个协实行民主管理。乡个协成立检查评比组、评税协税组、治安执勤组、综合治理组等组织，建立岗位责任制，进行目标管理，改变了以前一盘散沙的状况。
    军民共建以职业道德教育为主要内容，围绕个体劳动者带普遍性的问题开展工作。学员十三队协助个协共举办法制培训班7期，85％以上的个体从业人员参加了培训。他们还适时组织职业道德宣讲会、讲评会，开展主题竞赛活动。
    军民共建活动，增强了个体从业人员的法制观念和社会责任感。自去年以来，这个乡个协所属的个体户中，没有发现一例违法现象。今年9月份长沙地区开展税务大检查，大托乡个协所属个体户都被评为守法经营户。
