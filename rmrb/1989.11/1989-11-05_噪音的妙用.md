Noise, long despised by people, but perhaps you did not know, with the development of science, scientists have found many ways to turn harm into benefit, making noise serve humanity.

Noise Power Generation
Noise is also a form of energy. For example, a jet aircraft with a noise level of 160 decibels has a sound power that can reach 10 kilowatts. A professor at the University of Cambridge in the UK discovered that when sound waves encounter a barrier, they can be converted into kinetic energy. Based on this principle, they designed and manufactured a diaphragm-type sound wave receiver connected to a resonator to enhance the sound's focusing power. When the sound energy on the receiver acts on the sound-electric converter, it can convert sound energy into electrical energy.

Noise Cancellation
Recently, British researchers proposed a "sound wave cancellation method" to eliminate various noises from aircraft, diesel engines, cars, air conditioners, machine tools, etc., with good results. The principle of sound wave noise cancellation is simple: when two sound waves of equal strength and opposite direction collide, they can cancel each other out. British scholars use the method of installing microphones on the noise-generating engines to collect various noises, then use computers and sensors to measure the noise intensity, and based on this intensity, replicate their relative "concertos" to cancel out the noise, making a noisy environment quiet and silent.

Noise Drying Food
A university in the United States successfully used noise to dry food. The method is to use noise and low-frequency sound waves to strike food at high speeds, with an absorption capacity 4 to 10 times that of current drying technology. Traditional dehydration methods use heat treatment.

Noise Cooling
The United States has designed a refrigerator that relies on noise for cooling. The exterior is cylindrical, with glass fiber boards stacked outside the cylinder. The cylinder is filled with helium or other inert gases. One end of the cylinder is sealed, and the other end is a vibrating diaphragm box connected to a voice coil, wires, and a magnet. When sound waves act on the elastic diaphragm, they force the gas inside the cylinder to expand, and the heat generated is quickly conducted and dissipated by the glass fiber, thus achieving the purpose of cooling.

    噪音的妙用
    噪音，一向为人们所深恶痛绝，但也许你不知道，随着科学的发展，科学家们找到了许多化害为利的妙法，让噪音为人类服务。
    噪音发电　噪音也是一种能量，例如：噪音达到160分贝的喷气式飞机，其声功率竟能达到10千瓦。英国剑桥大学的教授发现，当声波遇到屏障时，能转化为动能。他们根据这一原理设计制造了一种鼓膜式声波接受器，与一个共鸣器相接，以增强声的聚集力。当接受器上的声能作用到声电交换器上时，可将声能转变成电能。
    噪音消除噪音　英国研究人员最近提出一种“声波消除法”，即利用噪音消除飞机、柴油机、汽车、空调、机床等发出的各种噪声，都有很好的作用。噪声声波消除法的原理很简单，即两个强度相等、方向相反的声波碰撞时，便能互相抵消。英国学者采取在噪声发动机上安装话筒的办法收集各种噪声，然后用计算机和传感器计量噪声强度，根据这个强度复制出它们的相对“协奏曲”，便可抵消噪音，使噪音污染的环境变得寂静无声。
    噪音干燥食品　美国一大学食品科学系研究成功用噪声干燥食品。其方法是以噪声和低频音波高速度地轰击食品，其吸水能力为目前干燥技术的4至10倍。而传统的脱水方法是采用加热处理。
    噪音制冷　美国设计了一种依靠噪音制冷的冰箱，外型呈圆筒状，圆筒外边叠放着玻璃纤维板，筒里充满着氦气或其它惰性气体。筒的一端封闭，另一端是一个振动膜盒，膜盒与音圈、导线和磁铁相连。当声波作用于弹性膜片时，迫使筒内气体膨胀，产生的热量由玻璃
    纤维迅速传导散失，从而达到降温制冷的目的。　　（刘萍　小云）
