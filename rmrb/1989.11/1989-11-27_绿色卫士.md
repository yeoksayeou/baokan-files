He—Zheng Qingming, a forest ranger at the Chan Tang Si Forest Farm of the Taihang Mountains Forestry Bureau—firmly upholds principles and is upright and unyielding in his struggle against illegal logging and resource destruction. Comrades praise him as an iron-willed green guardian.

On October 18 this year, Zheng Qingming and part-time forest ranger Zhao Sanyou were patrolling the mountains when they caught Yang Yincheng in the act of illegally logging. The next day, Zheng and Zhao discovered another 8 logs that Yang had cut at his home. According to the Forest Law, Yang was to be fined 3 to 10 times the value of the forest resources. After Zheng sternly explained the policy to Yang, Yang put on a pitiful face and begged for mercy, but Zheng refused; then Yang set out a lavish banquet, but Zheng firmly declined; next, Yang hinted at giving a "tip" to settle the matter privately, but Zheng's attitude was even more resolute. Cornered, Yang snarled, "No money, but I have one life, do as you wish!" Zheng Qingming replied sternly, "As a forest ranger, it is my duty to enforce the Forest Law!" At this, Yang Yincheng secretly took out an axe and, taking advantage of Zheng's moment of inattention, struck him on the neck. Zheng Qingming instantly fell into a pool of blood. To protect the socialist forest wealth and uphold the dignity of the Forest Law, Zheng Qingming sacrificed his young life.

Over the six years Zheng Qingming worked as a full-time forest ranger, he consistently loved his job and enforced the law impartially, even with relatives and friends. One night, Zheng set up a checkpoint on the road from Ziluo Village to Baiyun Village and stopped a small cart from Yan Zhuang Village carrying 4 logs. Seeing that the driver was his uncle, Zheng still said sternly, "You are my uncle, but you have broken the law, and I cannot break the law too." In the end, the farm confiscated the illegal logs and fined him 200 yuan.

During his years of forest protection work, Zheng Qingming personally reported and investigated over 200 cases of forest destruction, assisted the public security department in punishing and striking down more than 500 lawbreakers, and recovered direct economic losses of over 30,000 yuan for the state.

On October 20, the Taihang Mountains Forestry Bureau Party Committee made a decision: to call on all cadres and workers in the bureau to learn from Zheng Qingming's revolutionary spirit and strive to protect and develop the country's forest resources.

　　焦来魁　杜爱忠
    他——太行山林局禅堂寺林场护林员郑庆明在与盗伐森林，破坏资源的不法分子斗争中，坚持原则，刚正不阿。同志们称赞他是一名执法如山的绿色卫士。
    今年10月18日，郑庆明同半脱产护林员赵三侉巡护山林时，将正在偷伐森林的杨银仲当场抓获。第二天，郑庆明和赵三侉又在杨银仲家发现他偷砍的另外8根檩材。根据森林法规定，将处以杨银仲3至10倍的森林赔偿费。郑庆明严肃地向杨讲明政策之后，杨摆出一副可怜相向郑求饶，郑不答应；后又摆下丰盛酒宴，郑断然拒绝；接着又向郑暗示，给点“小费”私了，郑态度更为坚决。黔驴技穷，杨恶狠狠地说：“要钱没有，要命有一条，愿怎就怎！”郑庆明义正词严地说：“护林员按森林法办事义不容辞！”这时，杨银仲暗暗拿出一把砍山斧，趁郑不备之机，朝郑颈部猛砍，郑庆明顿时倒在血泊中。为保护社会主义森林财富，维护森林法尊严，郑庆明献出了自己年轻的生命。
    郑庆明从事专职护林工作六年来，一贯热爱本职工作，他秉公执法，对亲戚朋友也是一视同仁。有一天夜里，郑庆明在紫罗村到白云村的路上设卡巡护，卡住一辆岩庄村的小平车，车上拉着4根7尺檩条，庆明一看是姨夫，但还是不客气地说道：“你是我的姨夫，你已经犯法，我不能跟着也犯法。”最后场里按规定收缴赃物，并处以200元的赔偿费。
    在几年的护林工作中，郑庆明亲自举报和实地查清的毁林案件达200多起，配合公安部门惩处和打击不法分子500多人次，为国家挽回直接经济损失3万多元。
    10月20日，太行山林业局党委作出决定：号召全局干部职工学习郑庆明的革命精神，为保护和发展国家的森林资源而奋斗。
