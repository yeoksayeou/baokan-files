The television documentary series "On the Pages of the Republic" (hereafter referred to as "The Pages") was screened for the delegates of the National Labor Model Conference just before the conference, sparking a strong response. Both old and new labor models watched together, feeling a deep sense of familiarity. Indeed, it has been many years since ordinary laborers were collectively promoted like this. Now that it has happened, how could they not be moved!

In just two short months, the creators of "The Pages" traveled to 21 provinces and cities, delving into enterprises and rural areas, filming 104 labor models and advanced individuals from 28 industries and 101 units. They completed the largest promotional work since the founding of the nation, a "gallery of heroes."

"The Pages" vividly records the collective image of 104 heroic labor models in the history of the Republic's founding. In the early days of the Republic, with everything in ruins, the first generation of builders of the Republic, represented by labor models such as Meng Tai, Zhao Mengtao, Ma Hengchang, Wang Chonglun, Shi Chuanxiang, and Li Shunda, took on the role of masters and threw themselves into the battle to build a new world, laying the first foundation stone for the construction of New China. The construction of the Republic did not stop. Behind Meng Tai and his contemporaries, generation after generation of builders emerged, as did batch after batch of new labor models. Ni Zhifu, Wang Jinxi, Zhang Binggui, Luo Jianfu, Jiang Zhuying—the torch of their spirit was passed from hand to hand, and the great edifice of the Republic rose behind them. By the 1980s, the Republic had entered a new era of socialist modernization construction. Its construction army gathered into a surging torrent, and the names and deeds of labor models spread across the 9.6 million square kilometers of mountains and rivers. "The Pages" follows the historical timeline, tracing the trajectory of the Republic's construction, and opens up a cross-section of today, like a spark that ignites a prairie fire, integrating the gradual development of the country's construction and the unending contributions of laborers, singing a song of praise for the foundation.

"The Pages" provides a historical reference with a large number of vivid examples. It tells us: the era enriches the connotation of "labor models," and the working class is showing more and more maturity.

The composition of labor models in the 1980s compared to the 1950s has undergone significant changes. Labor models in the 1950s and 1960s were mainly frontline workers and peasants, with many being "simple" types who were humble and thrifty, and "diligent" types who worked hard and endured hardship. In the 1980s, the ranks of labor models increased by a large number of scientific and technical personnel and organizational management personnel, who, together with ordinary workers and peasants, were active in the socialist labor army. At the same time, labor enrichment, pioneering and innovation, mastering advanced scientific knowledge and production technology—these new characteristics of the times, along with the fine tradition of diligence and simplicity, make the labor models of the 1980s more colorful. The new generation of labor models are outstanding representatives of modern consciousness and modern construction, a "versatile" team that combines production, technology, command, and management.

The enrichment of the connotation of labor models shows that the foundation supporting the socialist edifice is not just thousands and thousands! In the 1950s and 1960s, labor models led the masses to lay the foundation of socialism with their spirit of dedication. In the 1980s and the longer years to come, more labor models are needed to lead more people to build a modernized strong country with their spirit of dedication. This is a logical necessity of history and an objective requirement for the continuous advancement of the communist cause!

For many years, we have been exploring the laws of propaganda work. Practice has proven that in recent years, propaganda and ideological and political work have shown a tendency to weaken. On the one hand, this is because we have, to some extent, neglected and relaxed leadership; on the other hand, there are also significant biases in the content and methods of propaganda. Regarding the latter, "The Pages" has left three enlightenments for propaganda workers.

The first enlightenment: We must pay attention to the propaganda of ordinary laborers. Including industrial workers, peasants, entrepreneurs, and cultural, educational, health, and scientific and technical workers, the broad masses of laborers are the heroes of the nation and the backbone of society. In them, the excellent qualities of our nation are concentrated, and the hope of the motherland's future is displayed. Therefore, their propaganda should naturally become the main content of propaganda work. Only in this way can propaganda work truly become a great spiritual force that inspires the people's fighting spirit and promotes social progress. "The Pages" faces the broad masses, selects typical examples from among them, making the audience feel familiar, knowing that "advanced individuals are among us," respectable and approachable, easy to understand and learn, thus producing a relatively large artistic infectious power.

The second: We must continuously explore and improve the art of propaganda. The appropriateness of methods directly affects the quality of propaganda. Although there have been improvements in recent years, rigid, stiff, conceptual, and didactic phenomena are still prevalent. The creators of "The Pages" understand that in doing people's work, persuasion is more effective than indoctrination. They fully believe in the recognition and evaluation capabilities of the propaganda objects, adopting news methods, being plain and simple, not seeking luxury, and embedding deep feelings in realism. They only focus on one or two outstanding points of the characters' personalities, leaving the audience with as much space for thought and association as possible. The methods of propaganda are varied and should not be rigid. From an artistic perspective, "The Pages" has many rough edges in its realistic approach, but in any case, it embodies an exploration of the method of unifying ideological education with artistic creation, and it has produced a relatively good propaganda effect, which is indeed worthy of appreciation.

The third: We must pay attention to the role of images. The power of examples is boundless. The vast stage of real life is constantly producing heroes and models like Zhang Side, Meng Tai, Lei Feng, Jiao Yulu, Luo Jianfu, and Zhang Binggui. They are both life prototypes and living artistic images, the best teachers. "The Pages" uses vivid characters as carriers, introducing their deeds, and presenting the spirit of masters, entrepreneurial spirit, and spirit of dedication to the audience in a lively and unadorned way, "following the object and turning," "wandering with the heart," achieving a moving effect.

　　新时代的群英谱
　　——电视片《在共和国的史册上》观感
　　任重
    中央电视台电视专题系列片《在共和国的史册上》（以下简称《史册》）在全国劳模大会前夕为会议代表专场播映，引起了强烈的反响。新老劳模一同观看，倍觉亲切。是啊，多少年没有这样集中宣传普通劳动者了，现在有了，怎能不让他们感动！
    短短两个月，《史册》的创作者们涉足21个省市，深入到企业和乡间，拍摄了28个行业101个单位的104位劳动模范和先进人物，完成了建国以来宣传容量最大的一部“群英谱”。
    《史册》形象地记录了共和国创业史上104位英雄劳模的群像。建国初期，百废待兴，以孟泰、赵梦桃、马恒昌、王崇伦、时传祥、李顺达等劳动模范为代表的第一代共和国的建设者们，以主人翁的姿态，投入了建设一个新世界的战斗，铺下了新中国建设的第一块基石。共和国的建设没有中断，在孟泰们的身后继起着一代又一代的建设者，也继起着一批又一批的新劳模。倪志福、王进喜、张秉贵、罗健夫、蒋筑英，熊熊的火炬在他们手中传递，共和国的大厦在他们身后崛起。到了80年代，共和国开始了社会主义现代化建设的新时期，她的建设大军汇聚成奔腾的洪流，劳模的名字和事迹也遍布了960万平方公里的山山水水。《史册》寻着历史的纵线，梳理共和国建设的轨迹，在今天的横断面上豁然展开，犹如一颗火种从点燃到燎原，把祖国建设事业的逐步发展和劳动者们前仆后继、源源不断的贡献融为一体，高唱起一曲献给基石的赞歌。
    《史册》以大量生动的实例，提供了一个历史的参照。它告诉我们：时代丰富着“劳模”的内涵，工人阶级正在显示出越来越多的成熟。
    80年代劳模的构成和50年代相比，已经发生了显著的变化。50、60年代的劳模主要是来自生产第一线的工人、农民，以默默无闻、节俭朴素的“简朴型”和勤勤恳恳、任劳任怨的“勤劳型”为多。进入80年代，劳模的行列里增加了一大批科学技术人员和组织管理人员，他们和普通工人、农民一起，活跃在社会主义的劳动大军中。与此同时，劳动致富、开拓创新、掌握先进的科学知识和生产技术这些富有时代精神的新特点，和勤劳简朴的优良传统一道，使80年代的劳模更显得多彩多姿。新一代的劳模是现代化意识和现代化建设的优秀代表，是一支集生产、科技、指挥、经营于一身的“全能型”的队伍。
    劳模内涵的丰富说明，支撑着社会主义大厦的基石何止千千万万！50、60年代需要劳模们以其献身精神带领广大群众去奠定社会主义的基础。80年代和未来更长的年代需要更多的劳模们，仍以其献身精神带领更多的群众去建设现代化强国。这是历史合乎逻辑的必然，更是共产主义事业不断向前发展的客观要求！
    多年来，我们一直在探索宣传工作的规律性。实践证明，近几年宣传和思想政治工作出现了被削弱的倾向，一方面是因为我们在一定程度上忽视和放松了领导，另一方面在宣传的内容和方法上存在偏颇也是一个重要的原因。关于后一个方面，《史册》给宣传工作者留下了三点启迪。
    启迪之一：必须重视宣传普通劳动者。包括产业工人、农民、企业家、文教卫生和科技工作者在内的广大劳动群众，是民族的英杰，社会的中坚，在他们身上，凝聚着我们民族的优秀品质，展示着祖国未来的希望。因此，对他们的宣传当然应该成为宣传工作的主体内容，唯其如此，宣传工作才能真正成为鼓舞人民斗志，推动社会进步的巨大精神力量。《史册》面向广大群众，从他们当中选取典型，使观众倍感亲切，知道“先进人物就在我身边”，可敬而可亲，易知而易学，从而产生了比较大的艺术感染力。
    第二：要不断探索和提高宣传的艺术。方法得当与否直接影响宣传效果的好坏。这些年虽有改进，但刻板、生硬、概念化、说教化的现象还是随处可见。《史册》的创作者们懂得，做人的工作，感化比灌输更有效。他们充分相信宣传对象的认识和评价能力，采取新闻手法，平实简朴，不求奢华，寓深挚于写实之中，只在人物品格的一两个突出点上着力，给观众留下尽可能多的思索和联想空间。宣传的方法是多种多样的，不应有一定之规。从艺术性角度去评价，《史册》的写实手法还有不少粗糙之处，但不管怎么说，它体现了一种把思想教育与艺术创造统一起来的方法的探索，而且产生了比较好的宣传效果，这毕竟值得珍视。
    第三：要注重形象的作用。榜样的力量是无穷的。现实生活的广阔舞台每时每刻都在涌现着张思德、孟泰、雷锋、焦裕禄、罗健夫、张秉贵这样的英雄和模范。他们既是生活原型，同时又是活生生的艺术形象，是最好的教员。《史册》就是以一个个色彩鲜明的人物为载体，通过对他们事迹的介绍，把主人翁精神、创业精神、奉献精神，生动而不假雕饰地展现在观众面前，“随物以宛转”，“与心而徘徊”，达到感人的效果。
