Song Defu, the first secretary of the Communist Youth League Central Committee, said at the conclusion of the second ideological and political work conference of the Communist Youth League today that cultivating youth with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline, who are successors to the cause of proletarian revolution, is the fundamental task and strategic goal of the Communist Youth League's ideological and political work, and indeed the entire Communist Youth League organization. It is a crucial issue facing all levels of the Youth League.

He pointed out that educating young members with communist spirit has always been a consistent stance of our party, and it is also a glorious mission entrusted to the Communist Youth League organization by the party. We must guide young members and youth to learn communism through practice. We must closely link the lofty ideals with daily work, and vigorously promote solid labor and creation. We should advocate starting from small things, carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, and cultivate the broad masses of young people and young members into qualified successors to the cause of proletarian revolution.

Song Defu revealed that at the twelfth plenary session of the twelfth central committee of the Communist Youth League, to be held in mid-December, measures will be studied on how the Communist Youth League can contribute to the rectification and deepening of reform.

The 38 national Youth League organizations introduced their experiences and insights on how to do a good job in ideological and political work at the conference.
