If you were to hold an election in China for the most famous "gate," Tiananmen Gate would surely win. This is not because it is resplendent with gold and jade, or because it holds an important position in architectural history, but because it has long become a symbol of the Republic. Think about it: it is featured on the national emblem, the first scene in TV news broadcasts, the anti-counterfeiting mark on the currency, and even the songs that toddlers sing. Even a successful volleyball block is called a "Tiananmen Wall"...

The higher the fame, the more mysterious it becomes. The more unattainable something is, the more people try to uncover its secrets. Tiananmen Gate is no exception. The author once met a person with a terminal illness, who was not long for this world. He traveled from the Northeast to Beijing at his own expense to visit all the tourist spots. When asked what he still hoped for, he said, "I want to go up to Tiananmen Gate and have a look."

He did not live to see the day when Tiananmen Gate was opened to the public.

It was an exceptionally clear day. Before dawn, the duty personnel discovered someone crossing the Golden Water Bridge and heading straight for the gate. Upon questioning, the response was a question:

"Isn't Tiananmen Gate officially open today? You don't know?"

The duty personnel were not expecting anyone so early and quickly directed them to the ticket office. One by one, ordinary citizens and foreign tourists who hoped to ascend Tiananmen Gate as soon as possible gathered at the ticket office under the gate. If you had not witnessed the scene, you could not have felt the solemn and respectful atmosphere of the queue. There were no jokes, no banter; everyone was serious. It was as if they were not there to sightsee, but to deliver a speech, or to be interviewed by the media...

It is no wonder. The opening of Tiananmen Gate to the public is indeed a historic step. These people were waiting for a historic moment.

—In feudal society, this was the place where the emperor exercised his supreme authority. During major ceremonies (such as the emperor's coronation, the enthronement of the empress, etc.), Tiananmen Gate was the place where edicts were issued. After the edict was read, a wooden phoenix with gold inlay was lowered from the gate, and the officials of the Ministry of Rites knelt below to receive it. This was known as the "Golden Phoenix Edict." The emperor used the gate to display his imperial power. As for the square in front of Tiananmen Gate, it was also a forbidden area. The common people could not even walk through it, let alone stop for a while, or they would be punished for "privately viewing the palace gate"...

—At the crowing of the rooster, the nation is bright. After Mao Zedong ascended Tiananmen Gate, it signified that Tiananmen Gate had returned to the people. Since then, the square has been expanded several times, and the gate has become even more majestic. On every festival, the Party and state leaders ascend Tiananmen Gate to hold major state ceremonies. Tiananmen Gate is held in high esteem by the people, and amidst this reverence, it also seems somewhat mysterious and ethereal, within reach yet beyond grasp...

When the spring breeze of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China blew across the land, the former residence of Chairman Mao in Zhongnanhai and the Great Hall of the People were both opened to the public. Could Tiananmen Gate be opened as well? There were different opinions from high-ranking leaders to the general public. Some thought that this was a place for major state ceremonies and should not be open to ordinary tourists. Others thought that there was no need to make Tiananmen Gate so mysterious; Tiananmen Gate should become a symbol of China's reform and opening up...

Later, a compatriot named Hua Xing wrote a letter to the Central Secretariat, saying: "For more than 30 years, every time I come to Tiananmen Gate, I look up at the gate tower and dream of one day ascending the heart of the motherland. I tell the people around me about my wish, and some say it is a fantasy, a daydream. I firmly believe that one day the dream will become a reality." His words were sincere, and his intentions were sincere. He also proposed specific suggestions in his letter, such as organizing overseas Chinese to donate funds to repair Tiananmen Gate. The central leaders made remarks on this. On May 1st, 1986, the gate was opened internally to receive delegates of the National People's Congress, members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and model workers. After they joyfully ascended the gate, many people thought not only of the honor this gave them, but also of deeper and farther-reaching implications. National People's Congress delegate Zhuang Qinghan wrote in the guest book: "The opening of Tiananmen Gate is a major symbol of our country's democratization process." Other delegates asked the staff: "When will it be officially opened?"

In 1988, it was the Beijing International Tourism Year. The Tiananmen Gate Management Office and the leaders of Beijing City believed that the time for Tiananmen Gate to open was ripe. They formally submitted a report to the Central Committee, hoping that on the first day of the International Tourism Year, Tiananmen Gate would officially receive tourists. The Central Secretariat formally approved their report in October 1987.

At nine o'clock, a bell rang, and the vermilion-colored gates on the east and west sides of Tiananmen Gate opened. The waiting tourists experienced the feeling of "the path to heaven opening" for the first time, stepping up the gate one by one. The responsible person from the Beijing Municipal Tourism Bureau awarded the first person to ascend Tiananmen Gate, Beijing Dongsi People's Market's 75-year-old retired worker Gao Xiwu and the American dentist couple Carter, with commemorative awards. They became the first people to greet the rising sun on Tiananmen Gate on the first day it was opened to the public.

From then on, Tiananmen Gate welcomed all kinds of Chinese and foreign tourists. They witnessed many unforgettable scenes.

—The attire and demeanor of the herdsmen immediately revealed that they came from the vast grasslands. "It's so magnificent!" Their Mandarin pronunciation was not accurate, and they had no more elegant words. Their eyes were not enough to take it all in, and their deep feelings were indescribable. They joked, "Let's sing a song! Sing a song!" Thus, the voices from the heart echoed in the air above the gate: "From the grasslands to Tiananmen Gate..." As they sang, they couldn't help but dance, constantly apologizing to the staff. One of them stood at the entrance of the hall, waving his arms, saying, "When Chairman Mao received us, it was like this..."

—This elderly man, with white hair and beard, wore an outdated work uniform and was accompanied by his granddaughter, walking slowly. He told his granddaughter, "This is called the horse path. Do you understand, the horse path? It used to be made of bricks, and later it was changed to stone..." Ascending the gate, he carefully looked from east to west, examining every detail, even the water channels and railings. The staff chatted with him and learned that he was a worker during the renovation of Tiananmen Gate. "I must come up and see it. At that time, we were building the gate, and now, we are ascending the gate. You young people don't know how noble this gate is. In the past, could we, bricklayers, ascend it? Even if we spent thousands or tens of thousands of yuan, we couldn't ascend it. It's only now, with this policy, that we can ascend Tiananmen Gate like the leaders."

The old man's wish was understandable. He had another thought, "I am also worried that so many people ascending Tiananmen Gate will damage it. How is it protected up there? So, I must come and see it." The old man said, walking into the hall. He examined every corner, touching every place he could reach. As he walked, he introduced the thickness of the pillars, the size of the lanterns... After spending nearly half a day examining the gate tower, soaked in his sweat, he finally descended the horse path with relief.

—This person was obviously an old soldier, although he was not in uniform and had no military rank, his military bearing and gait made everyone say he looked like a soldier. Upon inquiry, it turned out he was a "August First" soldier. "During the time in Yan'an, we were very close to Chairman Mao's residence and often saw him. He was very approachable. After the liberation of the nation, he proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China from up there, and this time I also stand on the gate tower, feeling that he is closer to us, don't you think?"

Standing next to this old soldier was a middle-aged woman. Judging by her appearance, she was about 40 years old, but her white hair had prematurely crept onto her forehead. She stood in the place where Mao Zedong waved to the crowd, lingering for a long time. Looking at the endless stream of vehicles on Chang'an Avenue, the fluttering red flags on the Great Hall of the People, and the people taking photos on the square. Looking and looking, tears filled her eyes. The staff approached to inquire, and she quickly stepped aside, but the tears could not be stopped, flowing down her face. The staff thought she had something to say and came to comfort her, but she could not help but cry out loud. "Comrade, what's wrong with you?"

"Nothing, nothing." She took out a handkerchief to wipe her tears, and the people around her began to guess: this place must have stirred up some of her memories, this place must have reminded her of a departed loved one, this place must have made her think of the Cultural Revolution, she was of that generation...

"Comrade, are you okay? Do you need to rest?" The staff asked again, and she still replied, "Nothing, nothing." She remained standing there for a long time. She fulfilled her own wish but left a mystery for others...

Not long ago, the author encountered a group of foreign tourists on Tiananmen Gate. They seemed to be students, speaking Mandarin and recognizing Chinese characters. They gathered around the service girl on the gate, asking questions.

"Did you hear that Tiananmen Gate is going to be closed?" A blue-eyed, high-nosed young man asked.

"There's no such thing. If it were to be closed, how would you have come up?" The tall and elegant girl countered.

The young man was laughed at by the counter-question. An elderly man who looked like an overseas Chinese said, "The opened Tiananmen Gate will not be closed."

The crowd burst into laughter.

The girl asked the white young man, "What do you feel after ascending our Tiananmen Gate?"

The young man pretended to think. Suddenly, he looked up at Tiananmen Gate Square, raised his thumb, and said in elegant Mandarin, "Magnificent, the opened Tiananmen Gate!"

Everyone applauded in unison.

### 壮哉天安门

    壮哉天安门
    董葆存
    如果在中国评选知名度最高的“门”，天安门肯定当选。这倒不是因为它金碧辉煌，在建筑史上占有怎样重要的位置，而是因为它早已成为共和国的象征。你想嘛，国徽图案上有它，电视新闻的第一组画面是它，人民币上防止伪造的标志也是它，就连咿呀学语的孩童唱的歌儿也离不开它，甚至打排球拦网成功了也被称为“天安门城墙”……
    知名度越高，也就越有神秘感。越是不可企及的东西，人们总是千方百计想探询个究竟。对天安门也不例外。笔者曾经遇到过一位身患绝症，不久于人世的人，自费从东北来到北京游览了所有能玩的地方，最后问他还有什么希望，他说：“我想到天安门上去看看。”
    他没能等到天安门城楼开放的那一天。
    那是个格外晴朗的日子，天刚蒙蒙亮，值勤人员就发现有人跨过金水桥，径直朝城门走来。迎上去一问，得到的回答是反问：
      “今天天安门正式开放，你不知道？”
    值勤人员没料到这么早就有人来，赶忙指点购票地点。一个、两个……希望尽早登上天安门的平民百姓和外国游人，陆陆续续来到城楼下的购票处。如果不是亲临那种场面，你是无法体会排队时的庄严肃静气氛的。没有玩笑，没有调侃，个个一本正经。仿佛不是来游览，而是准备发表就职演说，准备接受电视采访的……
    也难怪，天安门城楼能够对平民百姓开放，应该说是迈出了历史的一步。这些人所等待的，是一个历史时刻。
    ——在封建社会，这里是皇帝行使至高无上的天子的权力的地方，每当举行重大庆典（如皇帝登基，册立皇后等）时，天安门就是颁发诏书的地方。宣读完诏书，用一个木雕的金凤衔着从城楼上缓缓系下来，礼部的官员跪在楼下接诏。这就是所谓金凤颁诏。皇帝利用城楼，显示皇权。至于天安门前的广场，也是禁地。百姓不要说从那里走过，就是多停一会儿，也会以“私窥宫门”治罪……
    ——一唱雄鸡天下白。毛泽东登上天安门城楼后，标志着天安门回到了人民手中。自那以后，广场几经扩建，城楼更加庄严。每逢节日，党和国家领导人登上天安门，举行重大的国事活动。天安门城楼在人们心目中是崇高的，在崇敬之中，也觉得
  有几分神秘飘渺，可望而不可及……
    当党的十一届三中全会的春风吹绿神州大地的时候，中南海毛主席故居、人民大会堂相继开放了。天安门城楼能不能开放呢？从高级领导人到一般群众都有不同看法。有的认为这里是进行重大国事活动的场所，不应该对一般游人开放。有的则认为，没有必要把天安门搞的那么神秘，天安门应该成为改革开放的中国的象征……后来，有一位署名华兴的侨胞给中央书记处写信，信中说：“30多年了，每次到天安门，仰望城楼，梦想有一天能登上祖国心脏的心脏。我向周围的人说出我的愿望，有人说这是幻想，是白日作梦。我深信，总有一天梦想会成为现实。”其言也切切，意也切切。他在信中还提出天安门的维修经费可组织爱国侨胞捐款赞助等具体意见。中央领导同志对此作了批示。1986年“五·一”节，城楼组织内部开放，接待人大代表、政协委员和英模代表。他们兴高采烈地登上城楼后，许多人想到的不仅仅是这给了自己一种荣誉，而是更深更远。人大代表庄庆汉在留言簿上写道：“天安门城楼的开放，是我国民主化进程的重大标志。”还有的代表问工作人员：“什么时候正式开放呵？……”
    1988年，是北京国际旅游年。天安门管理处和北京市的领导同志都认为，天安门开放的时机业已成熟，他们正式向中央写报告，希望国际旅游年的第一天，天安门城楼正式接待游人。中央书记处于1987年10月正式批准他们的报告。
    九点钟一声铃响，天安门东西马道的珠红色大门打开。等候已久的游人第一次体验到“马道通天”的感觉，一步步踏上城楼。北京市旅游局的负责同志把第一个登上天安门的纪念奖，分别授予了北京市东四人民市场75岁的退休职工高希武和美国的牙科医生卡特夫妇。他们，成为天安门城楼对外开放第一天最早在城楼上迎接旭日的人。
    从此，天安门城楼接触到了形形色色的中外游人。目睹了一幕幕令人难以忘怀的情景。
    ——牧民的服饰，牧民的装束，叫人一看，就知道他们来自大草原。“太壮观了！”他们的汉语发音不准，也没有更华丽的词汇。眼睛不够用了，内心深处的感情无法表达了。自我解嘲地说：“唱一曲吧！唱一曲！”于是，发自内心的声音，在城楼上空萦绕：“从草原来到天安门……”唱着唱着，忍不住跳了起来，还不住地向工作人员表示歉意。其中的一位，站在大厅门口，挥起手臂，说：“毛主席接见我们时，就这个样子……”
    ——这位须发皆白的老者，穿一身不甚入时的工装，由孙女陪着，缓缓走来。边走边对孙女讲：“这叫马道。懂吗，马道。早年间是砖的，后来换成条石……”走上城楼，他从东向西，看的好仔细，滴水、拦杆都要看。工作人员同他攀谈，才知他是重修天安门时的工人。“我一定得上来看看。那时候，咱是修城楼，今儿个，咱是登城楼的。你们年轻人，不知道这城楼的高贵，过去，咱这样的泥瓦匠能上来？花几千块、几万块也上不来。还是如今的政策好，咱跟领导人一样，能上天安门。”
    老人的这种心愿，很好理解。他还有另一桩心思呢！“我也担心，这么多人上天安门，会不会毁坏？上面保护的怎么样？所以，我一定得来看看。”老人说着，走进大殿。每个旮旯里都看，能用手摸的地方，都要摸摸。边走边介绍，柱子有多粗，灯笼有多大……当他用了近半天的时间，把浸透着他的汗水的城楼看遍之后，才放心地走下马道。
    ——这一位显然是个老军人，尽管他没有军衔没着戎装，从他那军人姿态和步伐，谁都会说他像军人。上前一问，果然是个“三八”式。“在延安那阵子，我们离毛主席的住处很近，经常见到他，挺亲切。全国解放后，他老人家在这上面宣告中华人民共和国成立，这一回我也站到城楼上来，觉得他离我们近了，你们说是不是？”
    站在这位老军人旁边的，是个中年妇女。看面相也就是40岁上下，可白发却过早地爬上了她的额头。她站在毛泽东朝群众挥手的地方，久久伫立着。望着长安街上川流不息的车队，望着大会堂上猎猎的红旗，望着广场上照相留影的人群。望着望着，她的眼圈里含满了泪水。工作人员上前探问，她才躲开，泪水却再也止不住，流了满脸。工作人员以为她有什么事，来安慰她，她更是忍不住哭出声来。“同志，你怎么了？”
    “没什么，没什么。”她掏出手绢擦擦泪，她周围的人纷纷猜测：这里一定勾起了她的某种回忆，这里说不定叫她想起了逝去的亲人，这里可能令她想起了“文革”，她的年龄正是那一代人……
    “同志，您怎么了，要不要去休息一下。”工作人员再次来问，她依然回答：“没什么，没什么。”仍旧伫立在那里，许久，许久。她满足了自己的某种心愿，却给别人留下个谜……
    不久前，笔者在天安门上碰到了一群外国游客。他们似乎是留学生，会讲汉语，识得方块字。他们围住城楼上的服务员姑娘，问这问那。
    “听说，天安门要关闭？”一个蓝眼睛高鼻梁的小伙子发问。
    “没有影子的事。要关闭，你怎么上来了？”亭亭玉立的姑娘反问他。
    小伙子被反问笑了。旁边一位华侨模样的老者说：“开放的天安门，是不会关闭的。”
    人群里爆发出会心的笑声。
    姑娘问那个白人小伙子：“登上我们的天安门，您有什么感受？”
    小伙子作思考状。忽然，他抬起头来，看着天安门广场，伸出拇指，说了句文绉绉的汉语：“壮哉，开放的天安门！”
    人们不约而同地鼓起掌来。
