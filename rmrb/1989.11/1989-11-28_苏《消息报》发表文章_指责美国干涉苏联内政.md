The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an article on November 24 accusing the U.S. Secretary of State Baker of interfering in Soviet internal affairs regarding the Baltic republics.

The article pointed out that while Soviet-American relations have made positive progress and the two countries' leaders are preparing to meet in Malta, the United States has repeatedly engaged in interfering in Soviet internal affairs.

Several days ago, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a resolution on the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. Now, the U.S. Secretary of State has openly called for the Soviet Baltic republics to "restore supervision over their own future," and expressed the belief that "Latvian democratic forces will bring about changes within the country."

The article warned that Baker's actions are a rude interference in the internal affairs of another sovereign state, which is unacceptable and will inevitably have negative consequences for Soviet-American dialogue.

　　指责美国干涉苏联内政
    新华社莫斯科11月24日电　苏联《消息报》24日发表文章指责美国国务卿贝克在波罗的海共和国问题上干涉苏联内政。
    文章指出，在苏美关系取得积极进展、两国首脑准备在马耳他举行会晤之时，美国却接连发生干涉苏联内政的事件。
    数日前，美国参议院外委会通过了关于苏联纳—卡州问题决议。现在，美国国务卿又公开号召苏联波罗的海共和国“恢复对自己未来的监督”，并表示相信“拉脱维亚民主力量会导致国内的变化”。
    文章警告说，贝克的这种作法是对另一个主权国家内部事务的粗暴干涉，这是不能允许的，它不可能不对苏美对话带来消极后果。
