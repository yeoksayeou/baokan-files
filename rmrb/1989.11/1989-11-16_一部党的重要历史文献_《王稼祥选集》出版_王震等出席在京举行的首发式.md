Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 15th. A collection of the works of Wang Jiaxiang, an important leader of the Communist Party of China, has recently been published by the People's Publishing House. Today, the People's Publishing House held a launch ceremony for "Selected Works of Wang Jiaxiang" at the Great Hall of the People.

Wang Jiaxiang served as a member of the Central Committee of the Central Soviet Area, Vice Chairman of the Central Revolutionary Military Commission, and Director of the General Political Department from 1931 onwards. From the Zunyi Conference to the Seventh National Congress, he was a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and participated in the decision-making on many major issues by the Central Committee. After the founding of the nation, he held positions such as Director of the Central Committee's Foreign Liaison Department and Secretary of the Central Secretariat. Wang Jiaxiang has many important works in military political work, party building, ideological and theoretical work, the anti-Japanese national united front, and the party's foreign liaison work.

Vice Chairman of the State Wang Zhen attended the launch ceremony and spoke at the event. He said that the publication of "Selected Works of Wang Jiaxiang" is very meaningful for the broad readership to learn and study the glorious history of our party and army, to inherit and carry forward the precious spiritual wealth of our party and army. He said that Wang Jiaxiang's life was a revolutionary life. We should, under the leadership of the third-generation central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, inspired by the revolutionary spirit of Wang Jiaxiang and other predecessors, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, adhere to socialist reform and opening up, resolutely implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, and achieve new victories.

Xi Zhongxun, Wang Shoudao, and many other old comrades who had worked under Wang Jiaxiang's leadership recalled his moving deeds of loyalty to the party and the people, and his courage to uphold the truth. Wang Jiaxiang's wife, Zhu Zhongli, also spoke at the ceremony. The launch ceremony was presided over by Wu Xiuquan.

It is reported that "Selected Works of Wang Jiaxiang," this important historical document of the party, begins with the article "Only Revolution Can Liberate China from Imperialist Aggression" dated March 13, 1926, when the author was only 20 years old. He began to understand that the path to China's liberation lies in using revolution to overthrow the aggressors and oppressors. The concluding article, "A Brief Discussion on Some International Issues" dated June 29, 1962, reflects the author's far-sighted vision. In response to the debates within the international communist movement and the "leftist" views within our party at that time, he insisted on a scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts and put forward his unique views, demonstrating the theoretical courage of a Marxist. The collection includes 60 articles, of which 41 are published for the first time.

"The Selected Works of Wang Jiaxiang" was edited by the "Selected Works of Wang Jiaxiang" Editorial Group and reviewed by the Central Party Literature Research Office.
