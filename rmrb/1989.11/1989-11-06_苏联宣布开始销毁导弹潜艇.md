Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Perfiliev said at a press conference on the 3rd that the Soviet Union's action of starting to destroy missile submarines shows that it is implementing the theory of reasonable and sufficient defense.

On October 31, the Soviet Baltic Fleet held a decommissioning ceremony for the missile submarine "B-372" (referred to as the Golf class by the West) at its base.

Previously, the Soviet Union had decided to unilaterally completely destroy all six submarines of this class. Gorbachev said during his visit to Finland last week that, as a first step, two of them would be destroyed, and the remaining four would be destroyed by the end of 1990.

    苏联宣布开始销毁导弹潜艇
    苏联外交部发言人佩尔菲利耶夫三日在记者招待会上说，苏联开始销毁导弹潜艇的行动表明它正在实施合理足够的防御理论。
    十月三十一日，苏联波罗的海舰队在其驻地曾举行导弹潜艇“B—372”（西方称之为戈尔夫）退役仪式。
    此前苏联已决定单方面完全销毁所有这一级别的六艘潜艇。戈尔巴乔夫上周访问芬兰时表示，作为第一步，先销毁其中二艘，其余四艘将于一九九零年底以前销毁。
