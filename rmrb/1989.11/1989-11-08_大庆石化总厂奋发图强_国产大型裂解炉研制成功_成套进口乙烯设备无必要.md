A 27-meter-high, 300-ton domestic large-scale cracking furnace has recently been completed at the Daqing Petrochemical Plant.

This is a crucial piece of equipment for the Daqing 300,000-ton ethylene project to reach its designed capacity. After the Daqing 300,000-ton ethylene project started production in 1986, due to differences between the cracking raw materials and the original design requirements, the annual output was only 270,000 tons, losing 10% of the production capacity and incurring annual losses of tens of millions of yuan. The plant's leadership originally considered purchasing the technology for manufacturing cracking furnaces from abroad, but foreign companies were unwilling to transfer the technology, and joint design with foreign companies would take too long. Therefore, it was decided to design and manufacture a cracking furnace capable of producing 450,000 to 500,000 tons of ethylene annually.

After making this decision, the plant immediately organized efforts to investigate and analyze the imported furnace and domestic substitute materials, as well as the technical production conditions in China, to understand the situation thoroughly, build confidence, and encourage designers, manufacturers, and installers to explore boldly according to scientific laws. Through these efforts, the design was completed in January, and the furnace was built in October. The construction period for a single furnace was shortened by two-thirds compared to the installation of an imported furnace, and the quality was fully qualified, with no leakage at any weld seam after pressure testing. Except for some instruments and computer hardware that were imported, more than 95% of the equipment was manufactured domestically (mainly within the plant), saving the country more than $10 million in foreign exchange.

    大庆石化总厂奋发图强
    国产大型裂解炉研制成功
    成套进口乙烯设备无必要
    本报讯一座高27米、重300多吨的国产最大裂解炉，最近在大庆石化总厂问世。
    这是为大庆30万吨乙烯工程达到设计能力而增添的关键设备。大庆30万吨乙烯工程于1986年投产后，因裂解原料与原设计要求有所不同，年产量只有27万吨，失去10％生产能力，年损失数千万元。总厂负责人原想向国外购买裂解炉制造技术，外商不愿转让，与国外联合设计又工期太长，于是决定自己设计制造年产4.5万吨至5万吨乙烯的裂解炉。
    总厂作出这一决策后，立即组织力量对进口炉和国内代用材料以及我国生产技术条件，反复调查分析论证，摸清底数，增强信心，并鼓励设计、制造、安装人员按科学规律大胆探索。经过努力，终于1月份完成图纸，10月份建成，单炉工期比安装进口炉缩短2／3，质量完全合格，经试压无一焊口泄漏。全套装置，除部分仪器和计算机硬件引进外，95％以上设备都是由国内（主要是厂内）制造，为国家节约外汇1000多万美元。（武培真  丛辉  张重义）
