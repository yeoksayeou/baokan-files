    Accelerating the Modernization and Scientific Advancement of Education
    The Construction of the National Education Management Information System Commences

    China is currently initiating the establishment of a national education management information system. This signifies that China's education sector is rapidly advancing towards modernization and scientific progress.

    According to reports, this system will primarily use computers and modern information technology and management methods to collect, process, and disseminate educational and related information. Officials from the State Education Commission revealed that the purpose of building this system is to strengthen and improve educational information and statistical work, providing timely and reliable information to serve the management and decision-making of educational administrative departments and schools.

    Materials provided by the State Education Commission indicate that the national education management information system will adopt a network structure that aligns with China's administrative divisions and educational management system, consisting of four levels: central, provincial, municipal, and county. The central-level main system will be located at the State Education Commission, equipped with large and medium-sized computers, microcomputers, related networks, and office automation equipment, serving as the core of the entire system. Provincial-level systems will be set up in the educational administrative departments of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, acting as the hub of the entire system. They will serve as sub-systems of the central level and main systems for their respective provinces, equipped with medium and small-sized computers, microcomputers, and related networks. Municipal-level systems will be established in the educational administrative departments of cities and counties, acting as intermediate links for provincial-level systems, primarily equipped with microcomputers. County-level systems will be the foundation of the entire system, established in county educational administrative departments. Additionally, relevant information systems of higher education institutions will be included as part of the national education management information system.

    According to the State Education Commission, the construction of the national education management information system is planned to take approximately 10 years, divided into three phases. The first phase, from 1989 to 1990, will focus on the foundational construction and development of the State Education Commission, provinces, and some qualified cities, counties, and universities, establishing the main framework of the entire system. The second phase, from 1991 to 1995, will expand the system's information capacity and coverage, establishing basic models and methods. By the third phase, from 1996 to 2000, the entire national education management information system will be completed.

    It is understood that this system will utilize the satellite and microwave transmission network of China Educational Television for information dissemination. Relevant national departments will also use this system to strengthen educational information exchange with UNESCO and other countries.

    Additionally, the State Education Commission revealed that China will establish a national county-level education development dynamic monitoring network and initially conduct sample surveys on basic education information.

    加快教育现代化和科学化进程
    国家教育管理信息系统着手兴建
    新华社北京11月15日电　（记者赵卫）我国正着手建立国家教育管理信息系统。这表明我国教育正迅速地迈向现代化和科学化。
    据介绍，这个系统将以计算机为主要手段，利用现代信息技术和管理方法收集、处理和传播教育及相关的信息。国家教委有关人士透露，建立这个系统的目的在于加强并改进教育信息和统计工作，用及时、可靠的信息为教育行政部门和学校的管理与决策服务。
    国家教委提供的材料表明，国家教育管理信息系统将实行与我国行政区划和教育管理体制相适应的网状结构，基本分为中央、省、地市、县4级。中央级的主系统设在国家教委，配置大、中型计算机，微机和相关网络及办公自动化设备等，是整个系统的核心。省级系统设于各省、自治区、直辖市的教育主管部门，是整个系统的枢纽。它既是中央级的子系统，又是各省的主系统，配置中、小型计算机，微机和相关网络。地市级系统设在地、市的教育主管部门。作为省级系统的中间环节，它将以配置微机为主。县级系统是整个系统的基础，设立在县教育主管部门。此外，各高等院校的有关信息系统也将作为国家教育管理信息系统的基础部分被纳入其中。
    据国家教委介绍，建成国家教育管理信息系统，计划需要10年左右，共分三个阶段进行。1989年到1990年为第一阶段，这期间将重点进行国家教委、省和部分有条件的地市、县、高校系统的基础建设和开发，构筑起整个系统的主体框架。1991年到1995年的第二阶段，将扩大系统的信息容量和覆盖面，建立起基本的模型和方法。到1996年至2000年的第三阶段，将建成整个国家教育管理信息系统。
    据了解，这个系统将利用中国教育电视台的卫星和微波传输网进行信息传播。国家有关部门也将利用这个系统加强与联合国教科文组织和一些国家的教育信息交换。
    另据国家教委透露，我国还将建立全国县级教育发展动态观测网，并将首先开展基础教育信息的抽样调查。
