Most people "buy high," while some "buy low."
The refrigerator in the picture, after more than two years of hot sales, has risen in price from nearly 1,000 yuan to nearly 3,000 yuan. Now, with the market sluggish, its value has dropped to around 1,500 yuan. At this time, buyers like the ones in the photo come out to shop—spending less money, having more choices, and the sales staff even smiling… People can't help but admire the wisdom of these buyers.

    多数人“买涨”，有人却“买落”。
    图中这种冰箱在两年多的热销中从近千元涨至近3000元。而今，市场疲软，它的身价已跌落到1500元左右。这时，如同照片中的这几位一样的买主们出来购物了——少花了钱，可以挑选，售货员还有笑脸……人们不能不佩服这些买主的明智。
