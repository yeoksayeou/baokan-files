    Inflation Plagues Latin American Countries

    The Mexican newspaper *Excélsior* recently published an article titled "Latin America Did Not Reduce Inflation in the First Half of 1989," summarized as follows:

    Rapid inflation was the most unfavorable factor in Latin America's economy in the first half of 1989, particularly in Argentina and Peru, where the inflation rate quadrupled compared to the same period last year.

    A DPA economic survey in Latin America showed that among the 16 surveyed countries, 9 had significantly higher inflation rates in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 1988.

    These countries are: Argentina, from 121% to 613%; Bolivia, from 1.4% to 2.6% (up to May only); Brazil, from 167.7% to 175.6%; Chile, from 4.9% to 8.2%; Honduras, from 2.5% to 3.8%; Paraguay, from 3.9% to 14.1%; Peru, from 115.3% to 601.2%; Uruguay, from 27.1% to 36.9%; Venezuela, from 6.9% to 57.6%.

    In contrast, Mexico is one of the countries where inflation has significantly decreased, from 40.9% in the first half of 1988 to 9.3% in the first six months of this year.

    In addition to the inflation problem, some countries are also facing severe currency devaluation. For example: Argentina's currency devalued by 4794.5%, Venezuela's by 262.0%, and Nicaragua's by 211.7%.

    Meanwhile, Latin America's external debt continues to increase dramatically, with the total debt of 16 countries reaching $397.706 billion. In addition to traditional high-debt countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, the debt of Venezuela, Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador has also increased in recent months.

    Among the 16 surveyed countries, only two will not divert funds to repay principal and interest this year: Argentina and Panama. The other countries will have to use a large amount of funds to repay debt principal and interest, for example: Brazil ($14.65 billion, equivalent to 43.3% of its export income), Mexico ($14 billion, equivalent to 67.7% of its export income), and Venezuela ($5.548 billion, equivalent to 54.2% of its export income).

    In 1988, the aforementioned 16 countries had a trade surplus of over $25 billion. These countries have been continuously increasing their exports, totaling $96.848 billion. At the same time, they have been trying to reduce imports, with a total import value of only $71.696 billion. In these aspects, the 16 countries have made extraordinary efforts.

### 通货膨胀困扰拉美国家

    通货膨胀困扰拉美国家
    墨西哥《至上报》前不久刊登一篇文章，题为《拉美1989年上半年没有减少通货膨胀》，摘要如下：
    急剧通货膨胀是1989年上半年拉美经济最不利的因素，特别在阿根廷和秘鲁，其通货膨胀率与去年同期相比，增加了4倍。
    德新社在拉美进行的经济调查表明，被调查的16个国家中有9个国家今年上半年的通货膨胀率比1988年同期要高得多。
    这些国家是：阿根廷，从121％增加到613％；玻利维亚，从1.4％增加到2.6％（仅到5月份为止）；巴西，从167.7％增加到175.6％；智利，从4.9％增加到8.2％；洪都拉斯，从2.5％增加到3.8％；巴拉圭，从3.9％增加到14.1％；秘鲁，从115.3％增加到601.2％；乌拉圭，从27.1％增加到36.9％；委内瑞拉，从6.9％增加到57.6％。
    相反，墨西哥是通货膨胀大幅度减少的国家之一，从1988年上半年的40.9％减少到今年头6个月的9.3％。
    除通货膨胀问题之外，一些国家今年还面临货币严重贬值。例如：阿根廷货币贬值4794.5％，委内瑞拉货币贬值262.0％，尼加拉瓜货币贬值211.7％。
    与此同时，拉美外债继续惊人地增加，16个国家的外债总额达3977.06亿美元。除了传统的大负债国如巴西、墨西哥和阿根廷以外，最近几个月，委内瑞拉、秘鲁、哥伦比亚和厄瓜多尔的外债额也增加了。
    被调查的16个国家中，只有两个国家今年不会挪用资金以还本付息，它们是阿根廷和巴拿马。其它国家则要动用大量资金以偿付债务本息，例如：巴西（146.5亿美元，相当于其出口收入的43.3％）、墨西哥（140亿美元，相当于其出口收入的67.7％）和委内瑞拉（55.48亿美元，相当于其出口收入的54.2％）。
    1988年，上述16个国家的贸易出现了250多亿美元的顺差。这些国家不断地增加对外销售，总额达968.48亿美元。同时还努力减少进口，总进口额只有716.96亿美元。在这些方面，16个国家作出了非凡的努力。
