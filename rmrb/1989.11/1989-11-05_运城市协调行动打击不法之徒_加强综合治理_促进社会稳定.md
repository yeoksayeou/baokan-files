Yuncheng City in Shanxi Province has strengthened comprehensive security management and rectified market order. It has severely cracked down on criminal gangs involved in the production and sale of fake cigarettes and fighting, gambling, and other illegal activities, achieving noticeable results.

Yuncheng City is located at the junction of Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces. In recent years, some lawbreakers have gathered here for gambling. Some illegal cigarette dealers have used methods such as carrying on their backs, small-scale freight, and long-distance disguised transportation to buy and sell cigarettes, earning huge profits. Some lawbreakers even created serious incidents, disrupting social order.

Since September this year, under the deployment of the municipal Party committee and government, the public security, procuratorate, industry and commerce, taxation, and tobacco departments have jointly taken action. They have unearthed some hidden criminal gangs and destroyed three fake cigarette production dens. Illegal cigarette dealers have also been subjected to administrative penalties and economic sanctions.

Cigarette dealers Gao Yunlai and Wu Gaoming successively transported six truckloads of cigarettes from Yunnan, Shaanxi, and Guangzhou, totaling more than 3,000 cartons, worth over 200,000 yuan. Through public reports, the public security department has already apprehended the illegal cigarette dealers. Farmer Li Yingchun used mineral stones as a disguise and successively transported 32,000 cartons of Yunnan cigarettes from Yunnan's Chuxiong and Guangzhou by truck, disrupting the market. He has been apprehended by the public security department.

Due to the coordinated actions and comprehensive management of relevant functional departments in Yuncheng City, political, economic, and social order have been effectively promoted.

    运城市协调行动打击不法之徒
    加强综合治理  促进社会稳定
    本报讯　山西运城市加强治安综合管理，整顿市场秩序，严厉打击制造、贩卖假烟和斗殴聚赌的犯罪团伙，收到了明显效果。
    运城市地处山西、河南、陕西三省交界处，近几年来，一些不法之徒在这里聚赌，有些不法烟贩通过人背肩扛、零担托运、长途伪装拉运等方式，倒买倒卖，获取暴利。一些不法分子甚至制造恶性事故，扰乱社会秩序。
    今年9月以来，在市委、市政府的部署下，公安、检察、工商、税务、烟草等部门联合行动，挖出了一些暗藏的犯罪团伙，捣毁了三处制造假烟的窝点，不法烟贩也分别受到治安处罚和经济制裁。
    烟贩高运来、吴高明先后从云南、陕西、广州三地用汽车长途贩运卷烟六车，计3000余条，价值20多万元，通过群众举报，公安部门现已将不法烟贩捉拿归案。农民李迎春利用矿石作伪装，先后用汽车从云南楚雄、广州等地非法贩运云烟3.2万条，扰乱市场，现已被公安部门抓获。
    运城市由于有关职能部门协调行动，综合治理，有力促进了政治、经济和社会秩序的稳定。　　（侯殿堂　张丰）
