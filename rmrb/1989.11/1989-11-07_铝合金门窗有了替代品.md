    Aluminum alloy windows, whose production and use are currently strictly restricted in China, now have a new substitute. The Beijing Municipal Door and Window Company's Colored Panel Angle Steel Window Factory has recently introduced colored panel angle steel doors and windows. These windows can match the design and quality of aluminum alloy windows, but their price is one-third lower.
