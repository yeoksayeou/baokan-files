    In the morning of August, in the city of Urumqi, Xinjiang, a Han Chinese toddler less than two years old got lost. She walked back and forth on the street, and only when her stomach was hungry did she remember to go home. But where is home?

    The cries of the little girl attracted an elderly Uighur man. This 60-something-year-old man kindly spoke to her in Mandarin: "Little girl, don't cry. Grandpa will take you home!" But she didn't know where her home was, nor did she know her parents' names. All she knew was that her name was "Xixiang."

    The old man thought, "Xixiang is dressed so lightly, she must be from the city. A child this small wouldn't wander out alone if her home were far away." So, the old man and the little girl went from one courtyard to another, searching until noon, when they finally found Xixiang's parents' home. Xixiang's parents were so moved that they shed tears of joy.

    It turned out that Xixiang's father was an official in a hospital, and her mother was a switchboard operator in a hotel. Both were hardworking individuals. The Uighur old man was named Kurban. He used to work in the Urumqi power system and is now retired. Kurban happily said, "Xixiang in Uighur means 'Yipal.' What a coincidence! My granddaughter's name is Yipal Guli, which means 'fragrant flower' in Mandarin. Both Xixiang and Yipal Guli are our children, and they are the future of our motherland. I hope they will grow up to study hard and, like us, contribute to the construction of a new Xinjiang!"

    香香和伊帕尔的爷爷
    朱英武
    8月的清晨，新疆乌鲁木齐市团结路，一个不满两岁的汉族小女孩迷路了。她在街上走过来，走过去，等到肚子饿了，才想起该回家。可家在哪儿？
    小姑娘的哭声招来了一位维吾尔族老爷爷。这位60多岁的老人亲切地用汉语说：“小姑娘，不要哭，爷爷送你回家去！”可是她的家住在哪儿，她的父母叫什么名字，小姑娘全不知道，只知她自己的名字叫“香香”。
    老人想，小香香穿的衣服单薄，肯定是城里人；这样小的孩子自己出来，家必定不远。于是，这一老一少这个院子进，那个院子出，一直找到中午12点钟，才找到香香的爸爸妈妈的住处。香香的爸爸妈妈感动得流下了热泪。
    原来香香的爸爸是个干部，在一所医院里负责，妈妈是一所宾馆的话务员，都是勤奋工作的人。维吾尔族老人名叫库尔班，原来在乌鲁木齐电力系统当工人，现在退休了。库尔班老人高兴地说：“香香在维吾尔语里叫‘伊帕尔’。巧极了，我的外孙女名字叫伊帕尔古丽，汉语意思是香花。香香和伊帕尔古丽都是我们的孩子，都是祖国的后代。希望她们长大后好好学习，将来和我们一样共同建设新新疆！”
