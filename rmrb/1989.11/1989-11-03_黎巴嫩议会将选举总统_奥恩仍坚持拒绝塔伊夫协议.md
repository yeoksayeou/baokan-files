Beirut News: Yesterday evening, after concluding parliamentary consultations, Lebanese Speaker Husseini issued a statement inviting all Lebanese parliamentarians to attend a session of the Lebanese Parliament scheduled for November 4th at the Mansour Palace, located at the junction of East and West Beirut. The agenda includes a special session at 10 AM to elect the Speaker, at 11:30 AM to formally approve the Taif Agreement, and at 12 PM to elect the President.

To ensure the smooth conduct of the meeting, the representatives of the Arab League's three-party committee, Ibrahim, are taking necessary security measures at the venue. A security zone of 1.5 kilometers in length and 1.2 kilometers in width has been established around the Mansour Palace, with security provided by the Lebanese government's army, internal security forces, and Algerian observers.

According to reports, after the Taif Conference concluded, most of the parliamentarians from East Beirut remained in Paris. Lebanese military government leader Aoun warned that if these parliamentarians do not return to the country before the November 7th elections, he will declare the dissolution of the parliament. He also threatened to punish the Christian parliamentarians who attended the conference. They are currently in frequent contact and consultation with Muslim parliamentarians regarding their return to Beirut and a unified stance on the meeting.

Lebanese military government leader Aoun has consistently taken a stance of rejecting the Taif Agreement and has written to UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, accusing Israel and Syria of continuing their military occupation of Lebanon. Aoun also stated that if necessary, he will dissolve the parliament and declare a state of emergency to prevent the implementation of the Taif Conference. It is expected that tomorrow, Aoun will consult with East Beirut parliamentarians on the approval of the Taif Agreement and the presidential election.

According to local observers, Lebanese Muslim and Christian parliamentarians have not reached a consensus on the presidential candidate. The shadow of last year's failed presidential election still looms over this meeting, especially Aoun's tough stance, which has a direct impact on the meeting. Therefore, people are not optimistic about the upcoming parliamentary session.

    黎巴嫩议会将选举总统
    奥恩仍坚持拒绝塔伊夫协议
    本报大马士革11月2日电  记者吕志星报道：贝鲁特消息，昨天晚上，黎巴嫩议长侯赛尼在结束了议会协商后，发表公报，邀请全体黎巴嫩议员出席将于11月4日在贝鲁特东、西区交界处的曼苏尔宫召开黎议会会议。会议议程确定，4日上午10时召开议会专门会议选举议长，11时30分议会正式批准塔伊夫协议，12时选举总统。
    为保证会议的顺利召开，阿盟3方委员会代表易卜拉希米正在对会址采取必要的安全措施。决定在曼苏尔宫周围设立长1.5公里、宽1.2公里的安全区，由黎巴嫩政府军，内部治安军和阿尔及利亚观察员负责安全保卫工作。
    据报道，塔伊夫会议结束后，贝鲁特东区的大部分议员仍停留在巴黎。黎巴嫩军政府领导人奥恩警告说，如果这些议员不在11月7日大选前回国，他将宣布解散议会。他还声称要惩罚与会的基督教派议员。对此，他们正在同穆斯林派议员就返回贝鲁特和对会议采取统一立场问题进行频繁的联系和磋商。
    黎巴嫩军政府领导人奥恩对塔伊夫协议一直采取拒绝的态度，并致函联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔，指控以色列和叙利亚继续对黎巴嫩的军事占领。奥恩还表示，必要时他将解散议会和宣布紧急状态，以阻止塔伊夫会议的贯彻执行。预计明天，奥恩将同东区议员就批准塔伊夫协议和总统选举问题进行磋商。
    据此间观察家分析，黎巴嫩穆斯林和基督教议员在总统人选问题上并未取得一致意见。去年总统选举失败的阴影仍笼罩着这次会议，特别是奥恩的强硬立场，对会议有直接的影响，因此人们对即将召开的议会会议并不抱乐观态度。
