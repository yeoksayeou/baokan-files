The borrowing unit shall, within 15 days after signing the first loan contract, go to the local foreign exchange management department to handle the registration procedures and obtain the "Foreign Debt Registration Certificate" (hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Certificate") for periodic registration.

      2. When new loan contracts are signed or when there are changes such as withdrawals or repayments, the borrowing unit shall fill out the "Foreign Debt Contracting Situation Form" and the "Foreign Debt Change Feedback Form" (hereinafter referred to as the "Feedback Form") monthly and submit them to the registration department by the 5th of the following month.

      3. When the borrowing unit needs to open a foreign exchange account, it shall, with the "Registration Certificate" and the account opening approval letter issued by the registration department, go to the designated bank (hereinafter referred to as the "opening bank") to handle the procedures for opening a special foreign exchange account for foreign debt (hereinafter referred to as the "foreign debt special account") and send the receipt to the registration department the next day.

    5. For units that do not remit foreign exchange but need to remit the principal and interest of non-remitted foreign debt from within the country, they shall fill out the "Feedback Form" after the debt actually occurs, and send a copy of the "Feedback Form" to the registration department the next day. When the debt is due for repayment of principal and interest, they shall, with the approval document from the registration department, go to the opening bank to open a "Special Foreign Exchange Account for Repayment of Principal and Interest" (hereinafter referred to as the "repayment account"), and handle the procedures for remitting the principal and interest.

    6. For units approved by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange or its branches to place the loan abroad, they shall report the monthly deposit changes to the original registration department through the "Feedback Form."

    7. Domestic institutions borrowing from foreign-funded banks or Sino-foreign joint venture banks in China do not need to set up separate accounts, but the borrowing unit must handle the registration and submission of the "Feedback Form" in accordance with the relevant regulations.

    8. For borrowing units that obtain the "Registration Certificate" locally but need to handle account opening and repayment procedures in a different location, they may first go to the registration department in the different location with the "Registration Certificate" issued by the local registration department to handle the repayment approval procedures. The opening bank in the different location shall, within 3 days of handling the procedures, send a copy of the payment voucher to the original registration department.

    Article 7: After the last repayment of principal and interest recorded on the "Registration Certificate," the opening bank shall immediately cancel the "foreign debt special account" and the "repayment account."
