The clarion call of a certain Red Army regiment in the Shenyang Military Region woke up another golden morning in October in southern Liaoning. The troops marched onto the drill ground in orderly steps, and the regiment commander, Yu Deshui, was already standing there.

Month after month, year after year, the commander is always the first to arrive at the drill ground to organize morning exercises. Not only that, but during training, construction work, and the execution of various tasks, he is always on the front lines, organizing and directing with strict discipline. The soldiers say: Where the troops are, there our commander is.

In 1988, the regiment was ordered to go to the Chaihe Forestry Bureau in Heilongjiang Province to carry out logging and road construction tasks under extremely difficult conditions. In May, when they entered the mountains, it was still a vast expanse of forest and snow. This was the place described in "The Forest and the Snow." The vast forest was uninhabited, and the only companions of the soldiers were trees, vines, mosquitoes, rats, and "grass crawlers." In a few days, many soldiers had faces covered with sores from insect bites, more than ten officers contracted hemorrhagic fever, and some even got encephalitis. In such a harsh environment, should they continue or withdraw? The soldiers' eyes were all on their "commander." Commander Yu firmly said: "In the history of the Red Army regiment, there are only the words 'victory.' We cannot set a precedent for defeat." He became the undisputed "mainstay." On the 50-kilometer construction line, cars could not pass, and he relied on his two legs to make a round trip every day.

The leadership's personal example greatly boosted the morale of the troops, and by November of that year, the task was completed ahead of schedule, earning the title of "Advanced Construction Unit."

"Without understanding the training situation of the troops, effective training guidance cannot be implemented," this is a phrase that Commander Yu often has on his lips. He spends every day on the training ground, promptly discovering and solving problems that arise during training. He takes the platoons to the shooting range, and he can accurately assess which soldier can shoot well, because he knows his soldiers very well. In 1987, the regiment conducted anti-hunger training in Holla Mountain in southern Liaoning, with each person receiving only two liang of grain per day. At that time, the commander had a high fever but still insisted on training with the officers and soldiers for three days. His strict requirements in peacetime have finally cultivated a top-notch training unit.

In recent years, the regiment has won dozens of first places in military and division training competitions and has been recognized by the military region as an "Advanced Military Training Unit."

Yu Deshui treats the troops with strictness and love. If an officer or soldier breaks the rules, he criticizes them severely, even scolding them, but afterward, everyone says he is right. In recent years, he has repeatedly run to local departments to secure housing for long-term two-place living grassroots cadres, find jobs for the families of cadres, and find schools for the children of newly transferred cadres. The cold and heat, bitterness and sweetness of all the officers and soldiers in the regiment are always on his mind.

Commander Yu is very dedicated to his work with the troops but pays little attention to his family. His home is just across from the barracks, but he often goes weeks without seeing his family.

His wife said, "It's been a long time, and we've gotten used to it. His mind is always on the troops, and he rarely thinks about this family."

    部队在哪他在哪
    ——记某红军团团长、一等功荣立者于得水
    赵广志  董春生
    沈阳军区某红军团嘹亮的军号声，唤醒了辽南十月又一个金色的早晨。部队以整齐的步伐迈进操场，团长于得水早已站在那里了。
    月月年年，团长每天都是第一个到操场，组织早操。不仅如此，部队训练、施工生产、执行各项任务，他都深入一线，严格组织指挥。官兵们说：部队在哪儿，我们的团长在哪儿。
      一九八八年，部队奉命到黑龙江省柴河林业局执行伐木筑路任务，条件奇艰。五月份进山，还是一片林海雪原。那是
  “林海雪原”描写过的地方，茫茫林海无人烟，与官兵为伴的，除了树木、藤蒿，就是蚊子、老鼠、“草爬子”。不几天，许多战士满脸都是蛟叮虫咬留的疮疤，十多名干部得了出血热，还有一些人得了森林脑炎。在恶劣的环境下，是干还是撤？官兵千百双眼睛盯着他们的“统帅”。于团长坚定地说：“在红军团的历史上只有‘胜利’二字，我们不能开打败仗的先例。”他成了当之无愧的“主心骨”。纵深五十华里的修路线上，无法开车，他靠两条腿每天往返一趟。
    领导身先士卒，大振部队士气，当年十一月就提前完成了任务，被评为
  “施工先进单位”。
      “不了解部队训练情况，就无法实施有效的训练指导”，这是于团长经常挂在嘴边的一句话。他每天都在训练场上转，及时发现训练中的问题，及时解决。他把连队带到靶场上射击，哪个战士能打好，他能说出个八九不离十，因为他太了解战士了。一九八七年部队在辽南荷花山搞抗饥饿训练，每人一天二两粮。当时团长正发高烧，仍然同干部战士一样坚持了三天。平时严格的要求，终于带出一个军事训练拔尖的团队。
    几年来，这个团在军师的训练比赛中夺得几十个第一名，被军区树立为
  “军事训练先进单位”。
    于得水对部队严中有爱。哪个干部或战士犯了“规”，他批评得很凶，甚至骂几句，但过后大家都说他批得对。这几年，他多次跑地方有关部门，给长期两地生活的基层干部跑住房，为干部家属找工作，给刚随军的干部子女找学校。全团官兵的冷与热、甘与苦，都挂在他的心上。
    于团长对部队工作尽心尽力，对家里的事却关心得很少，他家就在营房对面，可家里也常常一、两个星期见不到他的影子。
    他的妻子说，长了，习惯了。他的心思都在部队，很少想到这个家。
