Xiaogai County's Huangqu River Township Financial Bureau's Ji Zhanzhou has been in charge of budget accounting since 1985. He strictly manages finances and is known as the "iron-skinned scrooge" on the financial front.

Soon after Xiaogai took over as budget accountant, his uncle came to borrow some public funds. Xiaogai said, "Borrowing public funds for personal use violates financial discipline." His uncle, surprised, turned around and left. Later, his uncle praised Xiaogai to his mother, saying he handled things fairly. However, his mother insisted that Xiaogai help his uncle borrow some public funds. Xiaogai explained, "I manage a lot of money, but if I lend it to my uncle this time, what if others come to borrow next time? To help my uncle, Xiaogai took out his own savings.

Last September, while checking accounts, Xiaogai discovered that the former township government affairs director had embezzled 800 yuan of public funds. The township government decided to remove the director from his post and give him a major demerit. They also required him to return the embezzled funds and pay a fine of 100 yuan. The director asked Xiaogai to change the embezzled funds to a legitimate loan to avoid punishment and fines, but Xiaogai refused. One evening, the director brought a desktop fan to Xiaogai. Xiaogai bluntly said, "I advise you not to do foolish things. Take the fan back. I am auditing your accounts according to the law, and you should be punished for your violations."

Last June, one evening, a classmate who worked at the township agricultural technology station invited Xiaogai to dinner. To his surprise, the director and deputy director of the agricultural technology station, along with the accountant, were all present. Xiaogai pulled his old classmate aside and asked, "What's the deal with this dinner?" The classmate replied, "Our station needs to purchase several sets of sofas. We heard that the county has allocated funds for agricultural technician training, and the director wants me to invite you to help transfer that money to our station's account." Xiaogai understood. He told his old classmate, "Privately transferring or embezzling special funds violates financial discipline." Xiaogai has declined many such invitations. He knows that accepting favors makes one weak, so he told the director, "First, I won't join the meal. Second, the agricultural technician training funds will be supervised by the financial bureau for their use." After saying this, he left.

　　“铁公鸡”计占州
    我县黄渠河乡财政所计占州同志，自1985年担任预算会计以来，严格把关理财，被人们称为财政战线上的“铁公鸡”。
    小计担任预算会计不久，他舅舅上门找他借点公款。小计说：“私人借公款是违反财经纪律的。”他舅舅吃惊地转身走了。事后，他舅舅向小计的母亲夸小计办事稳重公道。可他母亲听了后，一定要小计帮他舅舅借点公款。小计解释说：“我是管了不少钱，如果这次借给了舅舅，下次别人来借怎么办？为了帮助舅舅解决困难，小计拿出了自己的积蓄。
    去年9月，小计在清理账目时，发现原乡政府事务长挪用了800元公款。乡政府决定免除事务长的职务，并给予行政记大过处分；限期让他退还所挪用全部公款还罚款100元。事务长要求小计将他私自挪用公款改为正当借款，意在免于处分和罚款，但都被小计拒绝了。一天晚上，事务长抱来一个台式电扇送给小计。小计毫不客气地说：“我劝你别再做糊涂事，请将电扇拿回去。我清查你的账目是执法理财，你违纪就该按规定受罚。”
    去年6月的一天晚上，小计有位在乡农技站工作的同学请他吃饭。出他意料的是，乡农技站正、副站长和会计都来作陪。小计将老同学拉到一旁问：“这顿饭是啥名堂？”“我们站要添置几套沙发，听说县里拨来一笔农技员培训费，站长要我请你来通融一下，将那笔钱转到农技站的帐户上。”小计明白了。他对老同学说：“私自转移、挪用专款是违反财经纪律的。”像这样的宴席，小计不知顶了多少次，他懂得吃了人家的嘴软，便对站长说：“一、我不入席，二、农技员培训费由财政所监督使用。”说完话，他便告辞了。
