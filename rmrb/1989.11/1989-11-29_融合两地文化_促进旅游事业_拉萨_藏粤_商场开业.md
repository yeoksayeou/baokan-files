Today, a shopping mall named "Zang-Yue" opened, bringing a lively atmosphere to the usually tranquil ancient city of Lhasa.

This mall, a joint venture between the Guangdong Provincial Travel Enterprise Group and the Tibet branch of China Travel Service, is located at the foot of the Potala Palace on Beijing Road, an area bustling with merchants. The mall's decor, merchandise, and services all reflect a blend of Guangdong and Tibetan cultures. It is this unique fusion that has attracted numerous consumers, some of whom are simply here to experience a taste of the "sea breeze" from Guangdong.

The majority of the mall's staff are travel agency employees who are idle during the off-season. Some translators and guides are also receiving additional training here. A representative from Tibet Travel Service stated: "Diversifying operations to overcome enterprise difficulties is only a short-term solution. In the long run, they will turn this temporary downturn into an opportunity to vigorously develop the Tibetan tourism souvenir market." The reporter noticed that a batch of wooden carvings with distinct Tibetan characteristics, sourced from local artisans, are already on display in the "Zang-Yue" mall.

　　融合两地文化　促进旅游事业
　　拉萨“藏粤”商场开业
    本报拉萨11月28日电　记者卢小飞报道：今天，一个叫“藏粤”的旅游商场开业，使拉萨这个静寂的古城着实喧闹了一番。
    这家由广东省中旅企业集团与中旅集团西藏中旅社联营的商场，坐落在布达拉宫脚下商贾稠密的北京路上，其装潢、商品和服务都体现了广东和西藏两种不同文化的融合。大概正是这一点，吸引了众多的消费者，尽管有些人仅仅是来感受一下吹自广东的“海风”。
    这一商场绝大部分服务人员，是旅行社淡季闲散职工，一部分翻译、导游亦在此接受另一种训练。西藏中旅社负责人说：靠多种经营摆脱企业困境，还只是一种短期效应。从长远考虑，他们将把暂时的萧条作为一种机遇，利用这一空档大力开发西藏旅游工艺品市场。记者注意到：一批来自民间具有西藏特色的木雕，已摆上“藏粤”的柜台。
