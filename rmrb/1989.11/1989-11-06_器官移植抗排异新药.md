Scientists at the University of Pittsburgh in the United States have developed a new anti-rejection drug for organ transplants, which is expected to replace the currently used anti-rejection medication, cyclosporine.

This new drug, named "FK-506," has been used in liver transplant surgeries. The incidence of rejection reactions within eight months post-surgery has been reduced to just 2%, a 68% decrease compared to previous rates. FK-506 is extracted from a type of fungus found in soil. With this drug, it may be possible to simultaneously transplant multiple organs and even transplant animal organs into human bodies.

    器官移植抗排异新药
    美国匹兹堡大学科学家研制出一种器官移植抗排异新药，可望取代目前使用的抗排异药物——环斯坡任。
    这种名为“FK—506”的新药已用于肝脏移植手术。病人术后8个月之内产生排异反应的只有2％，比原来降低了68％。FK—506是从土壤内一种真菌中提取的。有了它，有可能实现同时移植几个器官，而且能把动物器官移入人体。
