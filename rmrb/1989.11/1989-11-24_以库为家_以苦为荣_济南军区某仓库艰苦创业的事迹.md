There was once a folk song that went: "Huangni Gully, Huangni Gully, look up to the mountain, look down to the stones." The Jinan Military Region's certain comprehensive warehouse, located at the foot of Aishan in Huangni Gully Village, has carried on the glorious tradition of the people's army's hard work and struggle, taking root in the mountains and valleys for more than 20 years.

Those who have been to Huangni Gully know that it is located at the end of a winding mountain road. There are no high-rise buildings here. Some cadres live with their families of three in a room of just over 10 square meters, while others simply live in the warehouse. During dry seasons, soldiers have to go far away to fetch water by car or collect it from the river for drinking. The harsh environment has brought many inconveniences to the work and life of this warehouse, but the cadres and soldiers, with the party's cause in mind, correctly handle the relationship between public and private, hardship and joy, taking the warehouse as their home and hardship as their pride. Since the establishment of the warehouse, there has not been a single accident.

Shao Shiqin, the political commissar of the warehouse who enlisted in 1968, has been here since the day the warehouse was built. He worked with the soldiers, swinging hammers and chisels, digging mountains and caves, working for more than ten hours at a time. The cadres and soldiers of this warehouse used their spare time to reclaim land. They turned dozens of acres of barren mountains into fertile fields and then planted more than 100,000 fruit trees, phoenix trees, locust trees, and poplar trees in the warehouse area. The saplings that Shao Shiqin planted personally have grown into tall trees, but he has been working in the company and platoon positions for 13 years. Someone asked him: "Old Shao, you've worked hard, but you're still just a company-level officer." His response was, "How can you do work and worry about these things?"

In 1984, Cheng Xianmin was transferred from the military region headquarters to this warehouse to serve as the director. Someone advised him, "Old Cheng, everyone is moving to the city, why are you still hanging around in the mountains? You might as well transfer out." An old superior who had transferred to Yantai also wrote a letter advising him: "Old Cheng, if you transfer to Yantai, I'll take care of your arrangements." Old Cheng thought, "The organization has arranged my home here, so I must take good care of this 'home.'"

Cheng Xianmin has been working and living with the cadres and soldiers for many years, and for several consecutive years, he has not taken a single day off. Last year, the organization arranged for him to go home on leave to take care of his sick wife and children. But he couldn't put his mind at ease with the warehouse's work, coming and going, and returning home four times but not resting for 30 days. Some people mistakenly thought that Cheng Xianmin and his wife were not getting along.

Over the years, this warehouse has never relaxed its efforts in promoting hard work and struggle. They invited old leaders from the army and local government leaders to give speeches at the warehouse, using slides and broadcasts to widely publicize examples of hard work and struggle, and organizing cadres and soldiers to learn from the spirit of hard work and struggle in nearby villages and towns. They set up family factories, with agricultural and sideline production increasing year by year, raising funds to build dormitories, using old materials to make more than 60 solar water heaters and solar baths, building a cultural center, and beautifying the camp environment. Recently, the warehouse leadership also allocated tens of thousands of yuan from production and operation to build guardhouse buildings for two guardhouses far from the warehouse area, and installed soil heating and toilets. In the past three years, this warehouse has also won 12 banners of excellence.

　　以库为家　以苦为荣
　　——济南军区某仓库艰苦创业的事迹
　　籍万勇　薛景全　年维佳
    这里曾流传着一首民谣：黄泥沟呀黄泥沟，抬头看山头，低头看石头。座落在艾山脚下黄泥沟村的济南军区某综合仓库，发扬人民军队艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，扎根山沟艰苦创业20多个春秋。
    到过黄泥沟的人都知道，它坐落在那弯弯曲曲的山路尽头。这里没有高楼大厦，有的干部一家三口挤在一间10多平方米的房子里，有的干脆住库房。每逢旱天，战士们只好到远处用车拉水或在河沟里接水饮用。艰苦的环境给这个仓库的工作和生活带来了许多不便，但干部、战士以党的事业为重，正确处理公与私、苦与乐的关系，以库为家，以苦为荣，自建库至今未发生一起责任事故。军区一位首长到仓库视察时流着泪说：“同志们辛苦了！”
    1968年入伍的仓库政委邵士勤，从建库那天起，就来到这里。他与战士们一起挥锤打钎，开山挖洞，一干就是十几个小时。这个仓库干部、战士利用业余时间拓荒造田，他们把几十亩荒山变成良田后，又在库区种植了10万多棵果树、梧桐、刺槐、杨树……邵士勤亲手栽的树苗长大成材了，而他却在连、排岗位上一干就是13个春秋。有人问他：老邵，你出力不少，可至今还是个连职。他的回答是，干工作哪能计较这些。
    1984年，程显敏从军区机关调进这个仓库任主任。有人劝他，老程哪，人家都往城里跑，你还在山沟转悠什么呀，趁早转业回来。转业到烟台市的一位老上级也来信劝说：老程，你转业来烟台我负责安排。老程想，组织上把家给我安排在这里，我就要管好这个“家”。
    程显敏长年与干部、战士工作和生活在一起，连续几年没休过一天假。去年，组织上安排他回家休假，照顾一下生病的妻子和孩子。但他放心不下仓库的工作，走了来，来了走，回家4次也没休满30天。对此，有人误认为程显敏夫妻不和。
    这些年来，这个仓库始终没有放松过进行艰苦奋斗的教育。他们请部队老首长、地方政府领导到仓库作报告，利用幻灯、广播，大张旗鼓地宣扬艰苦奋斗典型，组织干部战士到附近村镇学习地方艰苦创业的精神。他们办起了家属工厂，农副业生产连年翻番，自筹资金盖起了宿舍，利用旧材料，自制了60多个太阳能热水器和太阳能浴池，建起了文化中心，美化了营区环境。最近，仓库领导又从生产经营中拿出数万元，给两个远离库区的哨所建起了哨所楼，还装上了土暖气、卫生间。3年来，这个仓库还先后夺得12面优胜锦旗。
