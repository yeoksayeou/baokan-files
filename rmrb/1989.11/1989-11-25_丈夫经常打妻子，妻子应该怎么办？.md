I have seen a man frequently beat his wife, causing her to fall ill and making it difficult for her to manage household chores. Now, the man shows no signs of repentance, and the frequency of their fights has increased. I would like to ask: What should the woman do?

The Marriage Law stipulates that husbands and wives have equal status in the family. This mainly refers to the fact that husbands and wives each have an independent personality, and both have the freedom to work and participate in social activities; they have the right to manage and dispose of joint property; they have the right and obligation to jointly raise and educate their children; husbands and wives have the obligation to support each other. This is a new type of husband-wife relationship built on the basis of socialist public ownership. Husbands beating and scolding wives violates the principle of equal status and also infringes upon the wife's personal rights. Beating and scolding generally falls into three categories: First, general beating and scolding that does not result in serious consequences, which is a matter of criticizing and educating the perpetrator; second, beating and scolding that results in injury or illness, with serious cases incurring criminal liability (such as defamation, insult, injury, and homicide); third, persistent beating and scolding that constitutes the crime of domestic violence, which incurs legal responsibility. Therefore, the village committee, residents' committee, and the unit of the parties involved should all conduct legal education for the perpetrator to promote repentance and improve the husband-wife relationship. If, after multiple attempts at education, the perpetrator still does not repent, the victim can report to the People's Court, and the court will handle the case according to law.

Husbands and wives have the obligation to support each other, which is a manifestation of the equality of personal relationships between husbands and wives in terms of material and living conditions. The purpose is to strengthen the sense of responsibility for mutual assistance and support in the material lives of both husbands and wives. Mutual support between husbands and wives is both an obligation and a right. When one party fails to fulfill the obligation of support, the party in need of support has the right to request the other party to pay support through mediation or litigation procedures. The People's Mediation Committee or the People's Court should, in accordance with the law, firmly protect the party in need of support. If the wife is unable to take care of herself due to illness and the husband fails to fulfill the obligation of support, the wife can act according to the above principles.

### 丈夫经常打妻子，妻子应该怎么办？

　　丈夫经常打妻子，妻子应该怎么办？编辑同志：
    我见到一男子经常打妻子，致使女方疾病缠身，难以承担家务事。现在男方并没有悔改之意，夫妻打架更加频繁。请问：女方该怎么办？
                    吉林市　柳　明柳明同志：
    婚姻法规定，夫妻在家庭中的地位平等。这主要是指夫妻各自有独立的人格，都有参加工作和社会活动的自由；对共同财产有管理、处理权；对子女有共同的抚养、教育的权利和义务；夫妻有互相扶养的义务等。这是建立在社会主义公有制基础上的新型夫妻关系。丈夫打骂妻子，违反了地位平等的原则，同时也侵犯了妻子的人身权利。打骂人一般分为三种情况：一是一般性的打骂，没有引起严重后果，属于对打骂者批评教育的问题；二是打骂引起了伤病等后果，严重的要负刑事责任（如诽谤罪、侮辱罪、伤害罪、杀人罪等）；三是一贯打骂，构成虐待罪者，则要承担法律责任。为此，被打骂的一方的村民委员会、居民委员会和当事人的单位，都应对打骂者进行法制教育，促其悔悟，改善夫妻关系。如果经多方教育后，打骂者仍不悔改，被打骂者可以向人民法院告诉，人民法院立案后要依法处理。
    夫妻有互相扶养的义务，这是法律规定的夫妻人身关系平等在物质和生活上的体现，目的在于加强夫妻双方物质生活上互相帮助，互相供养的责任感。夫妻间的互相扶养，是义务也是权利。任何一方不履行扶养义务时，需要扶养的一方，有权通过调解或诉讼程序，要求对方给付扶养费。人民调解委员会或人民法院，应当依照法律规定，对需要扶养的一方，坚决给予保护。妻子如因病生活不能自理，丈夫又不履行扶养义务，妻子可按上述原则行事。
