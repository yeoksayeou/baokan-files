Starting from November 20th until February 28th, 1990, one-fifth of the cars in Mexico City will be banned from driving each day to reduce pollution during the dry season. This is the latest measure taken by the Mexico City authorities to control air pollution, known as the "No Driving Today" plan. This plan regulates that each car, based on the last digit of its license plate number and the color of its annual inspection sticker, must stop driving for one day from Monday to Friday. Except for medical emergency, public security, fire, and public service vehicles, all private vehicles are subject to this rule without exception. Violators will be heavily fined according to the "Ecological Balance and Environmental Protection Law."

Mexico City is the largest city in the world. The population of the city and its main satellite towns is over 18 million, with 3 million cars. Just the motor vehicles emit 9,778 tons of pollutants daily, mainly nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and lead. Of these, 75% are emitted by private cars. Vehicle exhaust pollution has become the primary source of pollution in Mexico City.

According to environmental protection departments, in the air of Mexico City, 55% of nitrogen oxides, 83% of hydrocarbons, 98% of carbon monoxide, and 100% of lead are all emitted by cars. Because Mexico City is located in a high-altitude basin at 2,240 meters, the air is relatively thin, making it difficult for pollutants to disperse. During the dry season, with little rainfall, pollution is even worse, to the point where on clear days, blue skies and white clouds are rarely seen. Pollutants accumulate year-round above the city, forming a gray, smoggy layer.

To control air pollution, the Mexico City authorities have decided to implement the "No Driving Today" plan. This will reduce the number of registered cars driving in the capital by 400,000 vehicles daily; reduce the number of out-of-town vehicles by 125,000; and correspondingly reduce the emission of 1,480 tons of pollutants daily.

　　“今天不准行驶”
　　——墨西哥城控制污染
　　本报记者　郭伟成
    从11月20日起到1990年2月28日，墨西哥城每天将有1／5的汽车不准行驶，以便减少旱季的污染源。这是墨西哥城当局为治理大气污染而采取的最新措施，命名为“今天不准行驶”计划。这一计划按照汽车牌照号码的尾数及年检牌照的颜色，规定每辆汽车从星期一到星期五必须停驶1天。除医疗救护、治安、消防及公共服务车辆外，各类私家车辆无一例外，违者均按《生态平衡与环境保护法》处以重罚。
    墨西哥城是世界第一大城市。市区及主要卫星城镇的居民多达1800万人，拥有汽车300万辆。仅仅机动车辆每天排放的污染物质就达9778吨，主要是氮氧化物、一氧化碳、碳氢化合物及铅。其中75％是私家车辆造成的。汽车排气污染已成为墨西哥城最主要的污染源。
    据环保部门测算，在墨西哥城空气中各有害有毒物质里，氮氧化物的55％，碳氢化合物的83％，一氧化碳的98％及铅的100％，均是汽车排放的。由于墨西哥城位于海拔2240米的高原盆地里，空气相对稀薄，各类污染物不易散开。逢到旱季，雨水稀少，污染更甚，以致于晴天日出，也很少见到蓝天白云。污染物常年聚集在城市上空，形成灰蒙蒙的废气层盖。
    为控制大气污染，墨西哥城当局决定推行上述“今天不准行驶”计划，这将使在首都注册的汽车每天少通行40万辆；外来车辆减少12.5万辆；每天将相应减少排放1480吨污染物。
