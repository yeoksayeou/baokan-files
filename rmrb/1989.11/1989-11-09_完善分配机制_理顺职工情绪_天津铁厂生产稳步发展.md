The Tianjin Ironworks has improved and perfected its bonus distribution system, stabilized workers' emotions, and ensured that producers and managers work together to overcome difficulties, reversing a previous decline in production. From May to September, the monthly output of pig iron exceeded 100,000 tons, setting a new historical high.

In production and management, the Tianjin Ironworks has formulated a series of regulations regarding the distribution of benefits, including bonuses, labor fees, housing, and promotions. In particular, the distribution of bonuses emphasizes rewarding frontline workers. Ironmaking, coking, and sintering, which are the main production units, receive first-class bonuses; transportation, water, electricity, and heat, which are auxiliary production units, receive second-class bonuses; and departments such as the office, logistics, and commerce receive third-class bonuses. Leaders at all levels receive the average bonus of office staff, and leaders with outstanding contributions are awarded additional bonuses after being evaluated by the workers' congress. Three percent of the bonuses are used for promotions, and any promotions involving factory leaders must be approved by the factory workers' congress and then reported to the city for approval.

    完善分配机制  理顺职工情绪
    天津铁厂生产稳步发展
    本报天津11月8日电  记者梁小琴报道：天津铁厂健全和完善奖金分配制度，理顺了职工情绪，生产者与经营者共度难关，扭转了一度出现的生产滑坡。5月至9月，生铁产量月月超过10万吨，创历史最高纪录。
    在生产和经营中，天津铁厂制订了一系列有关利益分配的规章制度，包括奖金、劳务费、住房、晋级等。尤其是奖金的分配，突出奖励第一线，炼铁、焦化、烧结等主体生产单位拿一类奖；运输、水电、热力等辅助生产单位拿二类奖；机关、后勤、商业等拿三类奖。各级领导干部拿机关干部的平均奖，有突出贡献的领导干部由职代会评议后，另行加奖。3％的奖励晋级，凡涉及厂领导干部的，必须通过厂职代会审议通过，再报市审批。
