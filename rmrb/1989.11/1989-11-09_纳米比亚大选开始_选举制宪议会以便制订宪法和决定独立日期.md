Namibia Begins Elections
Election of Constitutional Assembly to Draft Constitution and Determine Independence Date

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Windhoek, November 7th, reporter Xiong Zhongqi reports: Namibia's elections officially began today. Early in the morning, the people of Namibia's capital, Windhoek, with joy and excitement in their hearts, headed to the polling stations. Starting from 7 AM, all polling stations across the country began operations under the supervision and control of United Nations personnel. Today is a historic moment for the people of Namibia, whether they are black, white, or of mixed race. They will, over the course of 5 days from November 7th to 11th, elect the pre-independence constitutional assembly to draft an independent constitution and determine the date of independence, turning the century-long struggle of generations for national independence into a reality.

	The election began at 7 AM. The reporter arrived at the Katutura Primary School polling station in the black township on the outskirts of the city around 6:50 AM. At this time, thousands of people were already lined up along the iron fence surrounding the school, waiting to vote. They wore smiles and maintained order. Some young people wore blue, red, and green T-shirts representing the Southwest African People's Organization. Women dressed in festive attire, and some mothers even brought their babies. Some elderly people were in wheelchairs.

	This polling station had two ballot boxes inside. United Nations election supervisors, officials from the South African administration organizing the election, and representatives from 10 political parties were all seated at their respective desks. At 7 AM sharp, the first voter entered the polling station. After presenting his ID card with a photo and voter registration certificate, he received his ballot, walked into a voting booth isolated from the surroundings where no one could see, marked an X in the blank box next to the symbol of the party he chose, folded the ballot, and walked to the ballot box, making his choice for his country's future. As he walked out, the reporter approached him for an interview. He told the reporter: His name is Karl Mbaha, 39 years old, and he is a driver. He was so excited last night that he couldn't sleep. To be the first to vote, he came here at 4 AM while it was still dark. He openly said: He voted for SWAPO and firmly believed that SWAPO would win the election.

	At the Tahl Park Entertainment Center polling station in the city center, there were already two to three thousand people lined up, waiting to vote. The crowd included black people, as well as white people and people of mixed race. They chatted with each other, showing a harmonious atmosphere.

	The commander of the armed forces of the United Nations Assistance Mission, General Chand, was also inspecting this polling station. He told the reporter: "Everything is normal, the order is good, and I am very satisfied."

	The United Nations Special Representative, Ahtisaari, expressed satisfaction with the good start of the elections. A spokesman for the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group in Namibia said that Ahtisaari was particularly impressed by the long but orderly queues waiting to vote at the six polling stations he visited.

	The same scene was seen in other provinces. Officials in charge of the voting work were also moved to say that they did not expect the crowds to be so enthusiastic in the first few hours.

    纳米比亚大选开始
    选举制宪议会以便制订宪法和决定独立日期
    据新华社温得和克11月7日电　记者熊仲琪报道：纳米比亚大选今天正式开始。清晨，纳米比亚首都温得和克人民怀着喜悦、激动的心情，赶往投票站。从今晨7时开始，全国所有投票站在联合国人员的监督和控制下，开始工作。今天对纳米比亚人，无论是黑人、白人或有色人来说，是一个历史性时刻。他们将在7日至11日的5天时间里，选出独立前的制宪议会，以便制订独立宪法和决定独立日期，使一个多世纪来几代人为之奋斗的民族独立的愿望变为现实。
    选举于上午7点（当地时间）开始。记者在6点50分左右，赶到市郊黑人城镇卡图图拉小学投票站。这时，沿着学校周围的铁丝围墙已有数千群众排队，等候投票。他们面带笑容，秩序井然。有的年轻人，穿着代表西南非洲人民组织标记的蓝、红、绿三色T恤衫。妇女们穿着节日盛装，有的母亲还带着婴儿。有的老人坐着轮椅。
    这个投票站内设有两个投票箱，联合国选举监督员、南非行政公署组织选举的官员和10个政党的代表，都在自己的办公桌前就坐。7点整，第一个选民走进投票站，他出示贴有像片的身份证和选民登记证后，领取了自己的选票，走到一个与周围隔开，谁也不能看见的选举亭内，在他选定的政党标志后的空白框内打上×，然后叠上选票，走向投票箱，作出了他对自己祖国未来的选择。当他走出门外时，记者上前采访。他告诉记者：他的名字叫卡尔·姆巴哈，今年39岁，是司机。昨晚一夜激动得未能成眠。为了第一个投票，他今晨4点天还未亮就赶来了。他毫不隐讳地说：他投了人组的票，并且深信人组一定会在选举中获胜。
    在首都市中心塔尔公园娱乐中心投票站，已有二、三千人排成长龙，等候投票。人群中有黑人，也有白人和有色人。他们相互交谈，显示出融洽的气氛。
    联合国援助团武装部队司令昌德将军，也正在这个投票站视察。他告诉记者：“一切正常，秩序良好，我很满意。”
    联合国特别代表阿赫蒂萨里对大选良好开端表示满意。联合国驻纳米比亚过渡时期援助团发言人说，阿赫蒂萨里对他参观过的6个投票站长龙般然而有秩序等候投票的队伍印象特别深刻。
    在其它省份也是同样的景象，负责投票工作的官员也感动地说，他们没有想到在最初几个小时里群众就如此踊跃。
