Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, November 8th.

The Presidency of the South Slav Federation emphasized that the various nationalities in Yugoslavia should abandon mutual accusations and focus their main efforts on finding solutions to the economic crisis.

The Presidency of the South Slav Federation made this point at a meeting held today to discuss national relations within Yugoslavia.

The communiqué issued by the meeting of the Presidency of the South Slav Federation pointed out that the current deterioration of national relations is having a negative impact on the stability of the domestic situation in Yugoslavia, as well as on Yugoslavia's international standing and prestige.

In recent periods, there have been mutual accusations among some republics in Yugoslavia, particularly between the Republic of Serbia and the Republics of Slovenia and Croatia, over issues such as the amendment of the Slovenian constitution, the Kosovo problem, and the trial of the former leading figures of the League of Communists in Kosovo, such as Vllasi. This has led to heightened tensions in national relations.

The communiqué of the Presidency stated that, for the sake of the nation's interests, the Federal Presidency will formulate an action program to address the issue of national relations.

Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, November 8th.

The Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia emphasized that in order to stabilize the situation in Kosovo, ensure the peaceful life of all ethnic groups, and restore trust among the nationalities, it is necessary to consistently implement the policies and resolutions of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and to establish and strengthen a united front of progressive forces in Kosovo.

According to reports from local newspapers today, the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia expressed this stance after a meeting held yesterday to discuss the situation in Kosovo and countermeasures.

On October 30th of this year, the Titovo Mitrovica District Court began the trial of the former leading figures of the League of Communists in the Autonomous Province of Kosovo, including Azem Vllasi. Before and after this, Albanian residents of the province held continuous protests and demonstrations, demanding the release of Vllasi and the establishment of a "Republic of Kosovo."

The Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia pointed out that this is a continuation of the activities of Albanian separatist forces, exerting political pressure on state organs and those who have made efforts to stabilize the situation in Kosovo.

    南联邦主席团讨论民族关系问题时强调
    放弃相互指责　致力经济问题
    新华社贝尔格莱德11月8日电　南斯拉夫联邦主席团强调，南斯拉夫各民族之间应该放弃相互指责，把主要精力放在寻求解决经济危机方面。
    南联邦主席团是在今天召开的讨论南国内民族关系问题的会议上强调这一立场的。
    南联邦主席团会议发表的公报指出，目前南民族关系正在恶化，这对南国内局势的稳定、南斯拉夫的国际地位和威望都产生了不良影响。
    最近一个时期，南一些共和国之间，尤其是塞尔维亚共和国同斯洛文尼亚和克罗地亚共和国之间，在斯洛文尼亚修改宪法问题、科索沃问题以及审判科索沃前共盟主要领导人弗拉西等人的问题上相互指责，致使民族关系变得紧张。
    主席团的公报说，为了全国的利益，联邦主席团将制定一个解决民族关系问题的行动纲领。
    新华社贝尔格莱德11月8日电　南共联盟中央主席团强调指出，为了稳定科索沃局势，保障各族人民的和平生活和恢复各民族间的信任，必须始终不渝地贯彻南共联盟的政策和决议，建立和加强科索沃各民族进步力量的统一战线。
    据此间报纸今天报道，南共联盟中央主席团是在昨天开会讨论科索沃局势和对策后表明这一态度的。
    今年10月30日，铁托米特罗维察地方法院开始审讯科索沃自治省共盟前主要领导人阿·弗拉西案。在此前后，该省的阿尔巴尼亚族人连续举行抗议示威，要求释放弗拉西，要求成立“科索沃共和国”。
    南共联盟中央主席团指出，这实际上是阿尔巴尼亚分离主义势力活动的继续，是对国家机关和为稳定科索沃局势作出努力的人施加政治压力。
