In our county's Xinglong Street, there is a "Heng Chun Hui Restaurant" that is thriving. The owner is Deng Juying. This person, who had an 8-year history of petitioning and was famous throughout the province as a "petitioning specialist," went to Beijing in 1979 with her husband and children to seek justice. Deng Juying's family was able to settle down, which is largely thanks to the county's letter and visit office director, Wang Qing Shan.

Two years ago, when Wang Qing Shan took up his post as the director of the county's letter and visit office, the first person he received was Deng Juying. How to handle someone who had been petitioning for years, whose husband was ill, and whose family was extremely poor? Wang Qing Shan thought, to stabilize Deng Juying, the first step was to solve her family's livelihood problem. Wang Qing Shan decided to help Deng Juying open a restaurant in Chengguan Town. To this end, Old Wang and the relevant departments had to negotiate endlessly. Through their efforts, the Industrial and Commercial Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Tax Bureau, Health Bureau, and Bank all gave the "green light." During the restaurant's opening period, he would visit the restaurant several times a day, promptly capturing Deng Juying's thoughts. After a period of time, Deng Juying's enthusiasm began to wane, so Old Wang patiently guided her, stabilizing her emotions.

In addition to Wang Qing Shan, other relevant county leaders also helped Deng Juying solve her problems. With everyone's care, Deng Juying's small "Heng Chun Hui Restaurant" prospered.

    王青山与“恒春晖饭店”
    我县兴隆街，有一家“恒春晖饭店”，生意红红火火。店主人叫邓菊英。这个曾有8年上访历史，全省有名的“上访专业户”，1979年曾偕夫挑着孩子在北京喊冤。邓菊英一家能够安定下来，这不能不归功于县信访办主任王青山。
    两年前王青山调任县信访办主任时，首次接待的就是邓菊英。对这么个常年上访，丈夫有病，家中一贫如洗的人，从哪里管起？王青山心想，要安定邓菊英，首先要解决她一家的生计问题。王青山决定帮助邓菊英在城关镇开个饭店。为此，老王和有关部门天天磨嘴皮，通过努力，工商局、公安局、税务局、卫生局、银行都亮了“绿灯”。饭店开张那阵子，他一天要去几次饭店，及时捕捉邓菊英的思想苗头。一段时间后，邓菊英热情有点冷却，老王就耐心地开导她，稳定了邓菊英的情绪。
    除了王青山，县里其他有关领导也帮助邓菊英解决困难。精诚所至，金石为开。在众人的关心下，邓菊英小小的“恒春晖饭店”兴旺起来了。
