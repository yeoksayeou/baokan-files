The village of Menkou, located in Huayan Miao and Buyi Ethnic Township, Anshun City, Guizhou Province, is a natural village inhabited by the Buyi ethnic group. It consists of 42 households and 197 people. Situated 5 kilometers from the center of Anshun City, the village primarily engages in grain cultivation and, leveraging its proximity to the city, has gradually developed livestock and crop farming, thereby addressing basic food needs.

Notably, despite the village's relative poverty and remote location, a fervent reading culture has emerged. Parents encourage their children to study, siblings support each other in education, and young men and women mutually inspire each other to read. Personal diligence in studying is also highly valued. Households with more children pursuing education and those with children who have become "scholars" (students in high school or above) are held in high regard. Reading has become a silent competition, with families striving to produce their own "scholars."

"Even pulling a cart, I will support them in their studies," says Communist Party member Lou Yongxian. He has an elderly mother and three children, making a total of six family members. Besides farming, his wife raises pigs and chickens at home, while Lou Yongxian uses his spare time to pull a cart in Anshun City to support his eldest child's vocational school education in Duyun, Guizhou, his second child's middle school education in the city, and his third child's education in Huayan Township's ethnic primary school. Though life is not affluent, Lou Yongxian's resolve to support his children's education remains unwavering. When asked by the party branch secretary if he faces any difficulties, he replied, "There are difficulties, but I can overcome them myself. Even pulling a cart, I will support them in their studies! Without education, our descendants will never improve."

Party branch committee member Lou Yongyuan introduced that in 1978, during the national college entrance examination, Huayan District had six students admitted to vocational schools, three of whom were from the small village of Menkou. His eldest child, Lou Xingwen, was one of them, studying at the provincial electric power school and now working as an engineer at the Shuicheng Power Plant.

During the day, the youth either study or work, and in the evening, they gather in the village's cultural room to review or self-study. There are no idlers, troublemakers, gamblers, or those who engage in early romantic relationships. They all focus their energy on studying.

Villager Lou Yongchang, who speaks with a Confucian tone, scrimps and saves to invest in his children's education, supporting three children, two of whom have graduated from vocational schools and secured jobs. Lou Fada, a generation older than Lou Yongchang, endured seven or eight years of hardship to support his three children through vocational school.

In this village of over 40 households, since liberation, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, there have been youths annually admitted to vocational schools or higher education institutions. Two-thirds of the households have "scholars," with 70 or more having gone out to work. As cultural knowledge improves, more people advocate for reason and law, and incidents of fighting and brawling have virtually disappeared. Last year, there were five civil disputes, all of which were resolved within the village. Theft has also been eradicated, and people live in a stable, united, and industrious manner.

    布依村寨读书热
　　王大义
    贵州省安顺市华严苗族布依族乡的门口寨，是一个布依族聚居的自然村，共42户，197人。这里离安顺市中心5公里，以种粮为主，依托城市，逐步发展养殖业和种植业，基本解决了温饱问题。
    引人注目的是，在这个交通闭塞的偏僻村寨里，人们还不很富裕，却出现了读书的热潮。父母督促子女读书，兄嫂支持弟妹读书，男女青年互相鼓励读书，个人勤奋读书。谁家子女读书的多，谁家子女成为“秀才”的多（指初中以上学生），谁家就光荣。读书成了暗暗攀比的目标，你家读出一个“秀才”，我家也要读出一个“秀才”。
      “拉板车也要供他们读书”，共产党员娄永先说。他有一个老母和3个小孩，加上他夫妻俩共6口人。除了以种粮为主外，他爱人在家养猪喂鸡，娄永先就利用空闲时间到安顺市城里拉板车，供老大在贵州都匀读中专，老二在城里读中学，老三在华严乡读民族小学。生活虽不宽裕，但动摇不了娄永先供子女读书的决心。党支部书记问他有没有困难？他说：“困难是有，但我自己能克服，拉板车也要供他们读书！没有文化知识，万辈子也好不起来。”
    村党支部委员娄永元介绍：1978年统考，华严区共考取6个中专生，其中，小小的门口寨就有3个。他家大孩子娄兴文就是这次考取的，读省电力学校，现是水城电厂工程师。
    青年们白天有的读书，有的搞生产，晚上就到寨子中间的文化室复习或自学。没有游手好闲、惹事生非的，没有赌博的，没有过早“玩表”（谈恋爱）的，他们都把精力放在读书上。
    讲话有点孔夫子味道的村民娄永昌，节衣缩食，舍得搞智力投资，供3个小孩读书，现已有两个子女中专毕业，走上了工作岗位。比娄永昌老一辈的娄发达家，过了七八年的苦日子，供3个小孩读到中专毕业。
    这个40多户人家的村寨，自解放以来，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，年年都有青年考取中专以上的学校，2／3的人家都有“秀才”，其中外出参加工作的共70多人。随着文化知识的提高，讲理讲法的人多了，打架斗殴的现象基本没有了。去年曾发生5起民间纠纷，都在村里调解好了。偷摸现象没有了，人们过着安定团结和奋发图强的生活。
