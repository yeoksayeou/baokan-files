Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, November 3rd - The ever-changing Chinese market has, in just a few months, sent a large number of products from the peak of high sales to the low point of neglect. Many enterprises are facing difficulties. However, the Jilin Paper Mill, which has long insisted on technological upgrades, product quality, and enterprise reputation, has shown strong strength and endurance during this difficult period.

As one of the largest enterprises in China's paper industry, the products of the Jilin Paper Mill have always been in high demand. As the mill's director puts it, "we have never had to do any advertising," customers come to the factory to wait for the products to be produced. Even during the decades when the products were in high demand, the mill's leadership always kept the long-term interests of the enterprise in mind, focusing on enhancing the enterprise's endurance. The mill has insisted on relying on technological upgrades to improve production efficiency and product quality, thereby establishing enterprise reputation among users. Over the past decade, the mill has invested more than 200 million yuan in technological upgrades and enterprise progress, transforming the enterprise's old appearance. Currently, the mill generates 60 million yuan in benefits annually from technological upgrades alone.

Since the second quarter of this year, the paper industry has encountered unprecedented difficulties in product sales. Users have reduced their orders, and enterprise inventories have reached their highest historical levels. Just the reduction in prices means that the mill would lose 10 million yuan in revenue annually. For other similar mills, this would be an unbearable burden. However, the Jilin Paper Mill, relying on successful technological upgrades over the years, has a strong capacity to endure. The mill's labor productivity is more than 10% higher than the industry average. A mill manager said: "Even if the paper price drops by another 10%, the enterprise can still bear it, thanks to the benefits generated by technological upgrades."

    牢记长远利益　增强企业后劲
    吉林造纸厂靠技改避免困境
    据新华社长春11月3日电  （记者顾洪洪）风云变幻的中国市场，在短短几个月内把一大批产品由热销的顶峰抛到冷落的低谷。不少企业面临困境。而长期坚持企业技术改造，坚持产品质量和企业信誉的吉林造纸厂却在这困难的时期显示出强大的实力与后劲。
    作为我国造纸行业中最大的一个企业，吉林造纸厂的产品一直畅销。用这个厂厂长的话来说是“从来没有做过广告”，都是用户上门坐等产品出厂。就是在产品俏销的几十年中，这个厂的领导仍牢记企业长远利益，把功夫下在增强企业后劲上，这个厂坚持依靠技术改造来提高生产效益、产品质量，进而在用户中确立企业信誉。10年来，这个厂共投资2亿多元用于技术改造和企业进步。使企业旧貌变新颜。目前这个厂每年仅靠技术改造产生的效益就达6000万元。
    今年第二季度以来，造纸行业遇到了前所未遇的产品销售难问题，用户纷纷减少定货，企业库存上升到历史最高水平，仅降价一项，就意味着这个厂一年要减少收入1000万元。对于其他同类厂来说，这将是一个难以承受的包袱。而吉林造纸厂靠多年来成功的技术改造，使企业有了较强的承受能力，企业劳动生产率高于同行业10％以上。这个厂一位经营厂长表示：就是纸价再降10％，仅靠技术改造产生的效益，企业也承受得起。
