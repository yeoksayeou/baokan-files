The phrase "borrowing chickens to lay eggs" refers not to borrowing chickens to lay eggs, but to borrowing machines to produce results. How can machines lay eggs, and how can one borrow machines to lay eggs? This seems quite strange, but in Shanxi's Jincheng Mining Bureau, it is indeed a reality.

This mining bureau is an old one. To change its backward appearance, they decided to replace manual coal mining with mechanization, but they lacked the funds to purchase equipment. What to do? Someone came up with a good idea: they collaborated with research institutions and coal mining machinery factories, taking the newly developed equipment from these institutions for industrial trials. This approach has many advantages: first, the factories can use the equipment for free during the trial period; second, if the trial is successful, they can purchase the machines at a low cost; third, research institutions and machinery factories have a place to conduct trials, allowing them to produce results faster. Both sides benefit, and it is advantageous for both.

In the past two years, Jincheng Mining Bureau has borrowed many "chickens"! They undertook the industrial trial of converting 170-type coal mining machines to 340-type coal mining machines for Jixi Coal Mining Machinery Factory; the first 180P-type scraper conveyor industrial trial for Northwest Coal Machinery Factory; the first batch of 726-type scraper conveyor industrial trial for Zhangjiakou Coal Mining Machinery Factory; the first domestically produced AM-500 coal mining machine industrial trial for Taiyuan Mining Equipment Manufacturing Factory; the first domestically produced EL-90-type comprehensive mining machine industrial trial for Taiyuan Coal Science Institute; the first batch of domestically produced chain support frame industrial trial for Beijing Coal Machinery Factory, and so on. Borrowing "chickens" to lay eggs, chickens lay eggs, and eggs hatch chickens, arming the Jincheng Mining Bureau, which was previously short of funds and equipment. Now, the level of mechanization has reached 100%, production has doubled, and annual tax revenue exceeds 60 million yuan.

Currently, many enterprises are facing financial difficulties and having a hard time. Coal mining is a loss-making industry. In recent years, due to insufficient investment and overloading, it severely lacks the ability for self-improvement and self-development. However, necessity is the mother of invention, and change requires reform.

The road is paved by those who walk on it, and it is also forced by circumstances. Shanxi's Jincheng Mining Bureau has come up with a "borrowing chickens to lay eggs" method, arming new mines. Difficulties and opportunities coexist. It seems that as long as one thinks more and comes up with more ideas, the current difficulties are not insurmountable. This is the lesson that Shanxi's Jincheng Mining Bureau's "borrowing chickens to lay eggs" provides for us.

### “借鸡下蛋”好

　　“借鸡下蛋”好
　　燮阳
      “借鸡下蛋”，这里讲的鸡不是老母鸡的鸡，而是机器的“机”。
    机器怎么能够下蛋，而且是借别人的“机”来下蛋？这真是咄咄怪事，但在山西晋城矿务局果有其事。
    这个矿务局是个老矿务局。为了改变落后面貌，他们决心用机械化代替手工采煤，但缺钱买设备，怎么办？也不知谁想出一个好办法，他们同科研单位和煤矿机械厂合作，把这些单位刚刚研究成功的成果——新设备，首先拿到工厂来进行工业性试验。采取这种办法，好处甚多：第一，试验期间工厂可以无偿使用设备；第二，试验成功了可以廉价买下这些机器；第三，科研单位和机械厂有了试验场所，早出成果。双方满意，两头有利。
    这两年，晋城矿务局借来的“鸡”可多哩！为鸡西煤矿机械厂承担了由170型采煤机改装340型采煤机的工业性试验；为西北煤机厂承担了第一部180P型溜子工业性试验；为张家口煤矿机械厂承担了第一批726型溜子工业性试验；为太原矿山设备制造厂承担了第一部国产 AM—500采煤机工业性试验；为太原煤科院研制的第一套国产EL—90型综掘机承担了工业性试验，为北京煤机厂研制的第一批国产铺联网支架工业性试验，等等。借“鸡”下蛋，鸡生蛋，蛋孵鸡，把一个既缺资金又缺设备的晋城矿务局武装起来了。现在，机械化程度达到100％，产量翻了一番，一年上交利税6000多万元。
    现在，一些企业都在叫资金困难，日子不好过。煤矿是亏损行业，这些年，由于投入不足，负荷过重，严重缺乏自我改造和自我发展的能力，但穷则思变，变就要改革。
    路是人走出来的，也是逼出来的。山西晋城矿务局逼出一个“借鸡下蛋”的办法，武装了新矿井。困难与机会并存。看来，只要多动脑筋，多想办法，眼前的困难并不是没有办法克服的。这就是山西晋城矿务局“借鸡下蛋”给我们的启示。
