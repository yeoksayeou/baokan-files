China's cultural exchange and cooperation with Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh have been continuously developing and have a broad prospect for the future.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 11th, before Premier Li Peng's visit to these three South Asian countries, a cultural department official responsible for China's cultural exchange with South Asian countries was interviewed by our reporter today. The official said, "Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh are friendly neighbors of China. As early as thousands of years ago, China had already started cultural exchanges with these countries. After China established diplomatic relations with these three countries, such exchanges and cooperation have further developed."

He said, "Pakistan is one of the earliest countries to establish diplomatic relations with China. In the past decade or so, the two countries' governments have signed a cultural exchange execution plan every two years, including 35 items such as culture and art, education, broadcasting, film, television, news, sports, and religion. Both sides are satisfied with the implementation of the terms. China and Bangladesh signed a cultural cooperation agreement in Beijing in 1979. Since then, both sides have signed a two-year cultural exchange execution plan as per the convention. Nepal is also one of the earliest countries in South Asia to sign a cultural cooperation agreement with China. Both countries have been developing cultural exchanges in a healthy and stable manner in accordance with the spirit of the cultural cooperation agreement."

The official said:

"We firmly believe that Premier Li Peng's visit to Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh this time will further promote cultural exchanges and cooperation between our country and these three countries."

    我国与巴孟尼三国文化交流活跃
    据新华社北京十一月十一日电  中国与巴基斯坦、尼泊尔和孟加拉国之间的文化交流与合作不断发展，并有着广阔的发展前景。
    在李鹏总理访问这三个南亚国家前夕，文化部一位负责中国与南亚国家文化交流的官员今天接受了本社记者采访。这位官员说，巴基斯坦、尼泊尔和孟加拉国是中国的友好邻邦。早在几千年前，中国同这些国家的文化交流就已开始。在中国和这三国建交之后，这种交流与合作有了进一步的发展。
    他说，巴基斯坦是与中国建交最早的国家之一。近十几年来，两国政府每隔二年就签订一次文化交流执行计划，其内容包括文化艺术、教育、广播、电影、电视、新闻、体育和宗教等三十五项。中巴双方对条款的实施情况表示满意。中国和孟加拉国于一九七九年在北京签订了文化合作协定。此后，双方都按惯例签订为期二年的文化交流执行计划。尼泊尔也是中国与南亚国家签订文化合作协定较早的国家之一。两国都本着文化合作协定的精神，文化交流一直在健康稳步发展。
    这位官员说：
  “我们深信，李鹏总理此次对巴基斯坦、尼泊尔和孟加拉国的访问必将进一步推动我国与这三国之间的文化交流与合作。”
