Recently, many industrial and commercial enterprises have been troubled by market stagnation and the accumulation of unsold products. Some comrades feel that the market is an elusive "monster," even believing that the market is "inconstant and unpredictable, with no rules to follow." This raises a question: Is it true that the market is "unpredictable," or is it that our market forecasting capabilities are low, and we have not grasped the rules of market changes?

In fact, market changes, like any other movement, may seem chaotic on the surface, but they actually follow certain rules. Take this market stagnation, for example. On the surface, it seems to have happened overnight. However, if we delve deeper, we can see that this year's market stagnation was brewing in last year's market boom. The slowdown in industrial growth this year is a necessary consequence of last year's rapid industrial growth. Anyone with a clear mind or the ability to think can see that the situation last year, where a buying frenzy led to a market boom and enterprises operated at full capacity with rapid growth, was constrained by funds, energy, and raw materials and could not be sustained. Especially when the state seriously implements the rectification and adjustment policy, reduces demand, tightens credit, stabilizes prices, and encourages savings, the inflated market and production will quickly shrink. Market booms and slumps, and production speeding up and slowing down, are all within reason and are inevitable in development.

Why do some people feel that market stagnation comes suddenly? This is mainly because they confuse market observation with market forecasting, or they prioritize market observation over market forecasting, thus being misled by the surface and temporary phenomena of the market. Of course, market observation is important because it is the foundation or starting point of market forecasting. However, market observation is not the same as market forecasting. Only by refining the rich materials obtained from market observation, distinguishing the true from the false, and analyzing them comprehensively, can we talk about scientific market forecasting. In recent years, some enterprises have been passively following the market, producing whatever is hot and abandoning whatever cools down, running around busily but with little effect. This is because they only know how to conduct simple, surface-level market observations but are not willing to invest effort in in-depth, scientific forecasting, and thus can only passively follow the market rather than actively control it.

Practice has once again shown us that strengthening scientific forecasting and improving the market forecasting capabilities of enterprises and economic management departments is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. The ancients said: "Planning leads to success, lack of planning leads to failure." Under the conditions of China's socialist planned commodity economy, operational management decisions have a decisive impact on the development of production and the improvement of efficiency. Scientific market forecasting is the prerequisite for correct operational management decisions. Therefore, we must, based on market surveys and a large amount of information, use scientific methods to conduct in-depth analysis and then make correct predictions or judgments about market development trends. During market surveys, analysis, and forecasting, it is not only important to see the phenomena and problems that everyone has already noticed but also to discover situations and problems that others have not yet noticed. Only by being good at seeing the signs and focusing on developing new products with potential markets can we gain an advantage and excel in the fierce market competition.

    做好市场预测工作
    吕先声
    最近，许多工商企业对市场疲软、产品或商品滞销积压感到头疼。有的同志觉得市场是一个捉摸不透的“怪物”，甚至认为市场“变幻莫测，无规律可循。”这就提出一个问题：究竟是市场“无规律可循”，还是我们的市场预测水平低，没有掌握市场变化的规律呢？
    其实，市场变化同其它任何事物的运动一样，即使看起来杂乱无章，实际上也是有一定规律的。就拿这次市场疲软来说，表面上看，好像是在一夜之间发生的。然而，只要深入一层，就会看到，今年的市场疲软孕育在去年的市场过旺之中，今年的工业速度回落是去年工业超高速增长的必然后果。每一个头脑清醒或有思考能力的人都可以看出，去年由抢购风引发的市场销售过旺进而导致企业开足马力超高速增长的情况，受资金、能源、原材料的制约，是不可能持久的。特别是一旦国家认真贯彻执行治理整顿的方针，压缩需求，收紧银根，稳定物价，鼓励储蓄，那么，膨胀的市场和生产就会迅速消肿。市场一旺一疲，生产一快一慢，都在情理之中，都是发展的必然。
    那么，为什么一些人会感到市场疲软来得突然呢？这主要是因为他们把市场观测误当作市场预测，或者重市场观测轻市场预测，因而被市场表面的、暂时的现象所迷惑。当然，市场观测是重要的，因为它是市场预测的基础或开始。但是，市场观测不等于市场预测。只有将市场观测到的丰富材料去粗取精，去伪存真，由表及里，由此及彼，进行一番综合分析，才谈得上进行科学的市场预测。近年来，一些企业只是被动地跟在市场后面跑，看到市场上什么热销就生产什么，什么变冷就扔掉什么，疲于奔命却收效甚微，就是因为他们只会简单地进行表面的市场观测，而不肯花费气力进行深入的科学预测，因而只能消极地追随市场而不能主动地驾驭市场。
    实践又一次告诉我们，加强科学预测，提高企业和经济管理部门的市场预测水平，是一个亟待解决的重要问题。古人云：凡事预则立，不预则废。在我国社会主义有计划商品经济条件下，经营管理决策对生产的发展和效益的提高，具有决定性的意义。而科学的市场预测，又是正确的经营管理决策的前提。因此，我们必须在市场调查、占有大量情况的基础上，运用科学方法进行深入分析，进而对市场发展趋势作出正确的预测或判断。在进行市场调查、分析和预测时，不仅要看到人人都已经看到的现象和问题，更重要的是发现别人尚未注意到的情况和问题。只有善于见微知著，着力于开发具有潜在市场的新产品，才能棋高一着，胜人一筹，在激烈的市场竞争中立于不败之地。
