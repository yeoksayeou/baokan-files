There is an old saying: "Money can make the devil grind." However, for the officers of the Shapingba District Prosecutor's Office in Chongqing, this saying holds no water.

In mid-May this year, during the examination of illegal leads related to the Chongqing Valve Factory's management department, the Shapingba District Prosecutor's Office discovered that the manager Liu Jinlu and deputy manager Xue Zhijian had major economic issues and were involved with the factory director Yu Zhenxiang. After being summoned, Liu Jinlu felt the situation was serious and tried to use promises and bribes to cover up his crimes. On June 8, after the interrogation ended, Liu secretly told the investigator Luo Zeyi, "If you can settle this matter for me, I guarantee to give each of you 1,500 yuan per month, and an additional 20,000 yuan at the end of the year." When this was rejected and criticized, Liu did not give up. The next day, he told the investigators, "I can give each of you 5,000 yuan to go to Hainan for a trip." However, Liu's "generosity" was once again rejected. On June 12, the persistent Liu Jinlu came up with another plan. He told the investigators, "If you don't prosecute anyone, I can donate 500,000 yuan to your office." He even presented a fully stamped check, asking the prosecutors to fill in the amount themselves. The prosecutors were infuriated: "Do you think money can buy everything? We will investigate this case to the end according to the law!"

Faced with Liu Jinlu's various temptations, the prosecutors conducted their investigation even more meticulously. After arduous efforts, they uncovered the embezzlement crimes committed by Chongqing Valve Factory director Yu Zhenxiang, manager Liu Jinlu, and deputy manager Xue Zhijian. Currently, these three criminals have been arrested.

    50万元难动检察官的心
    俗话说：“有钱能使鬼推磨”。然而，对于重庆市沙坪坝区检察院的干警来说，此话却丝毫不灵。
    今年5月中旬，沙坪坝区检察院在审查重庆阀门厂经营部违法线索时，发现其经理刘金禄、副经理薛志坚等有重大经济问题，并涉及厂长于振祥。刘金禄被传讯后，感到问题严重，使出许愿和贿赂手段，企图蒙混过关。6月8日，刘在询问结束后，悄悄对办案人员罗泽毅说：“只要你们把事情给我搁平了，保证每月每人给1500元，年底再给每人2万元。”当遭到拒绝和批评后，刘仍不死心。翌日，他又对办案人员声称：“可以给每人5000元去海南玩。”然而，刘的“盛情”再次碰壁。6月12日，不死心的刘金禄又生一计。他对办案人员说：“只要不处理人，我可以给你院赞助50万元。”并当场拿出一张印鉴齐全的支票，让检察院干警自己填数字。检察官们被激怒了：“你以为金钱可以买到一切吗？我们就是要依法查到底！”
    面对刘金禄的种种诱惑，检察官们更加慎重地查办。经过艰苦努力，查实了重庆阀门厂厂长于振祥、经理刘金禄、副经理薛志坚贪污等犯罪事实。目前，这3名案犯已先后被逮捕。
