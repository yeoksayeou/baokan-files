Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, November 11th.

Iran today began its third round of a 10-day large-scale anti-drug campaign in the capital. On the same day, Iran also executed 20 drug traffickers in seven cities nationwide.

In the capital Tehran, 200 checkpoints have been set up at various squares, intersections, and strategic routes. There is news that drug traffickers from other regions of Iran are fleeing to the capital to avoid punishment.

Deputy Commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Committee, Sayyid Mahmoud Mir-Lohi, revealed on the 10th that since the beginning of the year, the anti-drug campaign has seized 519.8 kilograms of heroin, 13,180.8 kilograms of opium, 3,247.5 kilograms of Indian hemp products, and 4.1 kilograms of morphine.

Iran has been implementing a strict anti-drug law since January 21st of this year. This law stipulates that anyone possessing 30 grams or more of heroin or 5 kilograms or more of opium will be sentenced to death. So far, more than 1,000 drug traffickers have been executed.

The law also requires Iran's 1 million drug users to quit within half a year, otherwise, they will be sent to labor camps.

Mir-Lohi revealed that in the first round of the anti-drug campaign, 30,000 drug users were arrested nationwide, of whom about 10,000 were released after three months of labor reform.

At the beginning of this month, the anti-drug campaign entered its second round. In the past 10 days, 14,500 drug users have been arrested and sent to labor camps.

In coordination with the recent crackdown on drug trafficking gangs, Iran is currently formulating a comprehensive plan to educate the people about the harm of drug use to society and individuals.

Colombia is the world's largest drug-producing country. In the past two months, the Colombian government has dispatched anti-drug forces to conduct approximately 2,200 operations, seizing over 6,000 kilograms of cocaine and detaining 11,000 drug suspects.

    伊朗开展第三轮扫毒运动
    新华社德黑兰11月11日电  （记者李红旗）伊朗今天在首都开始了今年第三轮为期10天的大规模扫毒运动。在同一天，伊朗还在全国7个城市对20个贩毒分子处以绞刑。
    在首都德黑兰各广场、十字路口和战略要道，已设立了200个检查站。有消息说，伊朗其它地区的贩毒分子为逃避惩罚，纷纷逃往首都。
    伊斯兰革命委员会副司令赛义德·马哈默德·米尔卢希10日透露，自年初开展扫毒运动以来，共缴获519.8公斤海洛因、13180.8公斤鸦片、3247.5公斤印度大麻制品和4.1公斤吗啡。
    伊朗从今年1月21日起实施严厉的禁毒法。这项法律规定凡拥有30克以上海洛因或5公斤以上鸦片者将被处以死刑。到目前为止，已有1000余名贩毒分子被处以极刑。
    法令还要求伊朗的100万吸毒者在半年内戒毒，否则将送往劳改营。
    米尔卢希透露，在第一轮扫毒运动中，全国有3万吸毒者被捕，其中约1万人经过3个月劳改后获释。
    本月初，扫毒运动进入第二轮。在过去10天里，有14500名吸毒者被捕，送往劳改营。
    同最近的打击贩毒团伙斗争相配合，伊朗目前正在制订一项全面计划以教育人民懂得吸毒对社会和个人的危害。
