Vice Premier Tian Jiyun wrote a letter to all attendees of the ongoing National Small Chemical Fertilizer Conference, conveying the State Council's warm greetings to the broad masses of workers in the small chemical fertilizer industry nationwide. He expressed the hope that they would elevate the production, technology, and management of the small chemical fertilizer industry to a new level.

In his letter, Tian Jiyun stated that the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China had adopted the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Rectification and Deepening of Reform," which particularly emphasized the need to strengthen the foundational role of agriculture. It called on the entire Party and the nation to mobilize and concentrate efforts on improving agriculture, requiring all sectors to vigorously support agriculture. Small chemical fertilizers account for about 70% of the country's total fertilizer production, playing a crucial role in ensuring bumper harvests of grain and cotton and promoting steady agricultural development. Although there are currently some temporary difficulties, these can be gradually overcome through rectification and reform. Tian Jiyun urged relevant departments of the State Council and governments at all levels to fully prioritize the production of small chemical fertilizers, ensuring the supply of necessary funds, energy, and raw materials. Chemical industry departments at all levels should strengthen industry management, tap internal potential, and resolutely complete the fertilizer production tasks for the coming year.

This conference, held from November 21 to 24 in Shouguang County, Shandong Province, primarily aims to analyze the current situation of small chemical fertilizer production and to study policies and measures for elevating the small chemical fertilizer industry to new heights in the new situation. Minister of the Chemical Industry, Gu Xiu Lian, stated that, given China's national conditions, small chemical fertilizers will continue to play a significant role in supporting agriculture, both in the past, present, and for a long period in the future. This must be firmly upheld. Over the next three years, the policy for rectifying and reforming the small nitrogen fertilizer industry is to focus on existing enterprises, strengthen foundational work, comprehensively improve quality, and achieve steady development. Through rectification and reform, promote technological progress, and elevate the production, quality, and management of small nitrogen fertilizers.

    田纪云在信中说，党的十三届五中全会通过了《中共中央关于进一步治理整顿和深化改革的决定》，特别强调要加强农业的基础地位，号召全党全国动员起来，集中力量办好农业，要求各行各业大力支援农业。小化肥产量占全国化肥总产量的70％左右，对保证粮棉丰收、促进农业稳步发展有重要作用，虽然目前遇到了一些暂时困难，通过治理整顿是可以逐步克服的。田纪云要求国务院有关部门和地方各级政府充分重视小化肥生产，对所需的资金、能源、原材料要尽力优先保证供应。各级化工部门要加强行业管理，挖掘内部潜力，坚决完成明年化肥生产任务。
    这次会议11月21日至24日在山东寿光县召开，主要是分析当前小化肥生产的形势，研究在新形势下小化肥工业上新水平的方针和措施。化工部部长顾秀莲说，根据我国国情，无论是过去、现在还是将来很长一个时期，小化肥在支援农业中都要发挥重要作用，对此，必须坚定不移。今后三年小氮肥工业治理整顿的方针是，立足现有企业，狠抓基础工作，全面提高素质，实现稳步发展。通过治理整顿，推进技术进步，把小氮肥产量、质量和企业管理搞上去。（祁庆生　康纪武）
