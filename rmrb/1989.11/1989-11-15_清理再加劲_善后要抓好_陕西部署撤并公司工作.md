The Shaanxi Provincial Committee and Government have been vigorously pushing forward the cleanup and rectification of companies. At a meeting held on November 13, it was emphasized that the cleanup work should be intensified and follow-up measures should be strengthened.

In recent years, Shaanxi Province has seen a proliferation of newly established companies, totaling 7,853. During the rectification and cleanup process, the provincial committee and government, in accordance with the central government's directives, have been swiftly addressing the issue of company cleanups. From August of last year to the present, a total of 818 companies have been merged or closed, accounting for 10.4% of the total number of companies. Additionally, 6,513 cases of companies violating laws and regulations have been investigated and dealt with.

According to relevant departments, if the merger and closure ratio is set at one-third, approximately 2,600 companies in the province will need to be merged or closed, affecting the placement of over 70,000 employees. To address this, the provincial government has decided to take measures to handle the follow-up work for company mergers and closures. For the placement of employees, a multi-channel, multi-tiered, and multi-economic component approach will be adopted to disperse and arrange the workforce.

    清理再加劲　善后要抓好
    陕西部署撤并公司工作
    本报西安11月14日电　记者孟西安报道：“清理公司工作再加劲，善后工作要抓好。”11月13日举行的陕西省清理整顿公司会议提出这样的要求。
    陕西省近年来新办公司过多，各类公司已达7853个。在治理整顿中，省委、省政府按照中央的部署，抓紧了对公司的清理整顿工作。从去年8月至今，共撤并公司818个，占公司总数的10.4％，同时查处公司违法违纪案件6513件。
    据有关部门测算，如果按1／3比例撤并，全省大约要撤并公司约2600个，涉及7万多名职工的安置问题。为此，省政府决定采取措施，做好公司撤并的善后工作。对人员安置问题要采取多渠道、多层次、多种经济成分的方式分散安排。
