Biyan Yukuang, at the age of fifty-something, is of average height and weighs over 100 kilograms. When he walks, his large belly sways, and his five fingers spread out like a fan. This physique makes it hard to associate him with the image of a magician.

However, once Biyan steps through the curtain woven with thousands of shimmering golden threads and stands before the audience, miracles begin to happen. It's as if he has transformed through a "box swap" trick: he suddenly becomes another person. With a wave of his hand, a smoking cigarette appears out of thin air; with a snap of his fingers, a shower of colorful flowers flies freely; with a gunshot, a live person is split in half... His movements are swift, his techniques precise, his transformations ingenious, his stage presence graceful, and his demeanor elegant, all of which leave the audience breathless. Even his usually cumbersome appearance now serves as a contrast to his superb skills, making him appear clumsy yet agile, and adding a touch of humor.

Magic is an art that combines creation, production, preparation (pre-show work), and performance. Stage presence, sleight of hand, and innovative props are the three essential elements of a magic performance. However, all of these rely on engaging the audience's participation and creativity. Without the audience's involvement and cooperation, even the most skilled magician's performance can only be a mere display of technique and gimmickry. Biyan Yukuang's magic completely avoids this "craftsmanship" feel. His magic is a true audience art, created for the audience, from the audience, and returning to the audience.

Biyan's magic has a swift and decisive style, clean and efficient, seamless, and delivering multiple acts in a minute, giving the audience the greatest value. How extensive is Biyan's repertoire? It is said that when Biyan joined the International Magicians' Society, two grand masters tested him for over a week. Biyan performed hundreds of "hand tricks" to pass the test.

Biyan's magic also has a candid quality. He openly declares, "The character for 'magic' has a 'hemp' component. When the audience starts to relax, I begin to trick them." He avoids mysticism and instead unifies the secrecy and difficulty of magic with its accessibility and entertainment value, ensuring quality through difficulty and communicating information through simplicity to stimulate the audience's imagination.

Biyan's magic also has a humorous charm, filled with the warmth of ordinary people. His magic designs, concepts, and arrangements often have unexpected yet reasonable "wit," and cleverly utilize his unique physical conditions to create a strong contrast, comparison, and reflection on stage, crafting a lively, witty, and vibrant atmosphere.

Of course, Biyan's magic, as a whole, still lacks a certain cultural depth. The proportion of acts that use objects to convey meanings, play with objects, and express human emotions and ideals through magic is not significant. I would like to give Biyan a quote from the famous magician David Copperfield: "Magic should not only surprise people but also move them."

    袖里乾坤　指下大千
    ——观边玉宽魔术表演有感
    易凯
    边玉宽，年纪五十挂零，身材中等不足，体重一百公斤有余，走起路来，大腹便便，伸出五指，像把蒲扇，这副体态很难使人在他与魔术师之间产生些许联想。
    然而，只要老边穿过那道由千百条闪光金丝织成的幕帘，站在观众面前，奇迹便会发生，仿佛“男女换箱”一般，老边攸地变成了另一个人：举手，冒烟的香烟凭空摘取；弹指，五色的花雨随意飞扬；枪鸣，大活人立身纵劈两半……出手之迅捷，招数之利落，变幻之巧妙，台步之轻盈，风度之潇洒，简直令人拍案叫绝。甚至，连他那身在平日里略显多余的负担，此刻也变成了他高超技艺的一种反衬，笨而不拙，憨态可掬，平添了三分幽默的色彩。
    魔术是一门集创作、制作、卡活
  （演出前的准备工作）、表演合一的综合艺术。台风、手技献采、新型道具是魔术表演中的三要素。然而这一切都离不开吸引观众参与创造这个基础，没有欣赏者的参与合作，不能制造出那种使观众在认同中乐意被牵引、被捉弄的情境，再高明的魔术师的表演，充其量不过是一种模具的堆砌和技艺的卖弄。边玉宽的魔术彻底地摆脱了这种“匠气”，他的魔术是一种真正的观众的艺术，为观众而生，从观众中来，回观众中去。
    老边的魔术有一种速战速决的气势，干净利索，一气呵成，一分钟里演出多种节目，给观众以最大的实惠。老边的家底有多厚？据说，老边在加入世界魔术师协会之际，两位超级大师曾考核了他一个多星期，老边表演了数百套“手彩活”才得以过关。
    老边的魔术有一种坦诚的品格，他公开宣言：“魔字上面有一个麻，当观众开始麻痹时，我就开始捣鬼了”。他不搞神秘主义，而是将魔术的保密性、难解性与易识性、观赏性统一起来，以难确保质量；以易沟通信息，诱发观众的想象力。
    老边的魔术还有一种幽默的神韵，充满着普通人的温情。他的魔术的设计、构思和编排常有出人意外、又在情理之中的“急智”，并巧妙地借用自己身体的独特条件，构成舞台上一种强烈的反差、对比和观照，营造出一派轻松、俏皮、活泼的氛围。
    当然，老边的魔术从总体上看还缺乏一种文化的素养，那种托物喻意，借物游戏，通过魔术表现人类情感世界和理想的节目份量不重。我愿意赠送给老边世界著名魔术师大卫·科波菲尔的一句话“魔术不单要使人惊讶，还要使人感动。”
