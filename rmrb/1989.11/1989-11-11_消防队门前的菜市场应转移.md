The vegetable market in front of our fire station should be relocated.

Our fire brigade is located on the northern section of Aviation Road in the downtown area of our county. The garage doors of our barracks are facing the road. Our duty vehicles, command vehicles, and cargo trucks are parked in two garages. Since March of this year, the road north of the barracks has become a vegetable market. Every morning at dawn, vendors with carts, shoulder poles, and hand-carrying various vegetables and fruits gather here, loudly hawking their goods. Not to mention the bustling crowd of shoppers, but the various stalls have turned the sides of the road into an impenetrable barrier, seriously affecting our ability to quickly dispatch vehicles. Firefighting operations are always urgent, and if vehicles are obstructed, it will delay response times, potentially causing unnecessary losses to the state, collective, and individuals.

      消防队门前的菜市场应转移
      我消防中队位于我县城关航空路北段，营房大门口两侧是车库，车库门面向公路。中队的执勤车、指挥车和货车分别停放在两个车库里。从今年3月份起，营房大门往北的公路竟成了菜市场。每天早晨天刚亮，拉架子车的、肩挑的、手提的，带着各类蔬菜瓜果云集在这里大声叫卖，且不说买菜者人声鼎沸，摩肩接踵，但说各式各样地摊就把公路两边筑成“铜墙铁壁”，严重影响了我队及时出车。消防出车，都是紧急情况，车辆被阻，贻误战机，会给国家、集体和个人带来不应有的损失。
