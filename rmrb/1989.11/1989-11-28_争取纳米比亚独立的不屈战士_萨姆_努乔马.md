The victory of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), led by Chairman Nujoma, in the Namibian elections has led me to recall my interview with Nujoma in Lusaka, Zambia, in May 1985. In the reception room of the SWAPO office, Chairman Nujoma thoroughly analyzed the situation of the struggle in Namibia at that time. As the conversation was nearing its end, he told us, "The situation is favorable for us. The day Namibia gains independence is not far off." Today, his prediction is becoming a reality. However, to achieve this day, Nujoma and the SWAPO, along with other organizations and groups fighting for Namibian independence, have gone through a very difficult and tortuous struggle.

Sixty years ago, on May 12, Sam Nujoma was born in a village in the desert region of northern Namibia. His father was a farm worker. As a child, Nujoma tended livestock while attending a nearby church school. From 1943 to 1949, he lived with relatives in Walvis Bay and Windhoek, where he had the opportunity to learn English. Later, he worked as a servant in the state-owned railways under the racist rule of South Africa, witnessing the various forms of racial discrimination against blacks. One incident left a deep impression on him: a railway worker lost a leg in an accident, but the racists refused to pay him any compensation. The young Nujoma resolved to fight for equal rights for blacks. In his spare time, he voraciously read pamphlets about the struggles for liberation in Ghana and Zambia.

In April 1959, Nujoma co-founded the "Ovambo People's Organization" with Toivo and others. In December of the same year, he was arrested and imprisoned for leading a protest against the authorities' forced relocation of blacks, but he was soon released. In February of the following year, Nujoma secretly left Namibia. He traveled across the African continent by foot, horse, car, train, or plane. Sometimes he disguised himself as a patient, other times as a miner, evading the questioning and inspections of border police, patrols, and immigration officials, and finally arrived in Ghana in West Africa. In June 1960, he went to New York to attend a meeting of the United Nations Committee on South West Africa, where he submitted a petition denouncing South Africa. During this period, he and other leaders of the "Ovambo People's Organization" decided to formally change its name to the South West Africa People's Organization, with him as its chairman to this day.

In 1961, Nujoma established the SWAPO's temporary headquarters in Dar es Salaam. He had sued the South African authorities at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Five years later, he flew back to Windhoek, where he was arrested at the airport and forcibly deported. Soon after, the Hague Court refused to accept the SWAPO's lawsuit against South Africa. Nujoma then realized that it was necessary to transition from non-violent struggle to guerrilla warfare.

On August 26, 1966, he led the SWAPO guerrilla forces to fire the first shot against the South African colonizers in Kaprivi, marking the beginning of the armed struggle of the Namibian people. The guerrilla forces grew stronger in the struggle, expanding their areas of operation and dealing heavy blows to the South African colonial army. At the same time, Nujoma and other SWAPO leaders conducted extensive international activities, making SWAPO the internationally recognized sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people.

In September 1978, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 435 to resolve the Namibian issue, demanding that South Africa withdraw from Namibia and allow the Namibian people to hold free elections under UN supervision, draft a constitution, form a government, and achieve independence. After more than a decade of repeated struggles, the South African authorities finally accepted Resolution 435 and acknowledged the self-determination rights of the Namibian people.

This year, after nearly 30 years of absence from his homeland, Nujoma finally returned to Windhoek. As soon as he stepped off the plane, he knelt on the ground and kissed the soil of his motherland, saying excitedly, "Returning to the motherland, I feel very happy." His 89-year-old mother finally saw her son, whom she had not seen for many years. Mother and son embraced tightly.

Now, the Namibian elections have been successfully completed, and Chairman Nujoma's SWAPO has won the elections. The independence of Namibia is within reach, and we are genuinely happy. We sincerely wish the newly independent Namibia prosperity and prosperity.

### 争取纳米比亚独立的不屈战士——萨姆·努乔马

    争取纳米比亚独立的不屈战士——
　　萨姆·努乔马
　　鲍世绍
    以努乔马主席为首的西南非洲人民组织在纳米比亚大选中获得胜利，使我追忆起1985年5月在赞比亚采访努乔马主席时的情景。那是在卢萨卡人组办事处接待室里，努乔马主席向我们透彻分析了当时纳米比亚斗争的形势。在谈话快结束时，他告诉我们：“形势对我们有利，纳米比亚获得独立的日子为期不远了。”如今，他的预言正在变成现实。可是，为了这一天的到来，努乔马和他领导下的西南非洲人民组织以及其他争取纳米比亚独立的组织和团体，是经历过十分艰难而曲折的斗争的。
    60年前的5月12日，萨姆·努乔马出生在纳米比亚北部沙漠地带的一个农村里。父亲是农场工人。童年时，努乔马一边放牧，一边到附近的教会学校上学。1943年至1949年，他先后在沃尔维斯湾和温得和克的亲友家居住，并有机会学习英语。之后，他在南非种族主义者统治的国营铁路局当服务员，亲眼看到了种族主义者歧视黑人的种种行径。有件事给他留下了深刻印象：一位铁路职工在事故中失去了一条腿，种族主义者竟拒绝付给他任何补偿。年轻的努乔马下定决心要为黑人争取平等的权利而斗争。他利用业余时间，如饥似渴地阅读介绍加纳、赞比亚人民争取解放斗争的小册子。
    1959年4月，努乔马与托伊沃等共同创建了“奥万博人民组织”。当年12月，他因领导黑人群众抗议当局强迫迁居而被捕入狱，但很快获释。翌年2月，努乔马秘密离开纳米比亚。他时而步行、骑马，时而乘汽车、火车或飞机，穿行了非洲大陆。旅途中，他有时装成病人，有时打扮成矿工，躲过了边防警察、巡逻队及移民局官员的盘问和检查，最终抵达西非的加纳。1960年6月，他到纽约出席了联合国西南非洲委员会会议，递交了一份声讨南非的请愿书。在此期间，他同其他“奥万博人民组织”的领导成员一起，决定将其正式改名为西南非洲人民组织，他任该组织的主席至今。
    1961年，努乔马在达累斯萨拉姆建立了人组临时总部。他曾向海牙国际法庭起诉过南非当局。5年后，他乘飞机回到温得和克，在机场被捕，并被强制押解出境。不久，海牙法庭宣布，拒绝接受人组对南非的诉讼。努乔马由此认识到，必须从非暴力斗争转入游击战。
    1966年8月26日，他领导的人组游击队在卡普里维向南非殖民者打响了第一枪，揭开了纳米比亚人民武装斗争的序幕。游击队在斗争中日益壮大，活动地区不断扩展，沉重打击了南非殖民军。同时，努乔马等人组领导人还开展了广泛的国际活动，人组成了举世公认的纳米比亚人民唯一的合法代表。
    1978年9月，联合国安理会为解决纳米比亚问题通过435号决议，要求南非撤出纳米比亚，让纳米比亚人民在联合国监督下进行自由选举，制定宪法，成立政府，实现独立。经过10余年的反复较量，南非当局才接受435号决议，承认了纳米比亚人民的自决权。
    今年9月，阔别祖国近30年的努乔马终于回到温得和克。他一下飞机，就双膝跪在地上，亲吻祖国的土地，激动地说：“回到祖国，感到非常幸福。”他89岁的老母也终于盼来了分别多年的儿子。母子俩紧紧地拥抱在一起。
    如今，纳米比亚大选已顺利结束，努乔马主席领导的“人组”取得了大选的胜利，纳米比亚的独立已指日可待，我们从内心感到高兴，衷心祝愿新生的纳米比亚繁荣昌盛。
