Guizhou Adjusts Planting Structure to Reverse Grain Deficit

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, November 15th - Reporters Pan Ditou and Hu Yueping report: Guizhou Province has decisively adjusted its grain planting structure, vigorously expanding the cultivation of small-season crops to increase grain production. The goal is to quickly reverse the long-term situation of relying on grain imports. This year, the province's planting plan for small-season crops is 20 million mu, accounting for 71.5% of the total arable land, an increase of nearly 2 million mu compared to last year.

Guizhou, known as "eight parts mountains, one part water, and one part fields," has less than one mu of arable land per person. Coupled with poor soil and frequent natural disasters, the province's annual grain production has hovered around 6.5 million tons for many years. Facing the widespread tendency in rural areas to prioritize large-season crops over small-season crops, the provincial Party Committee and government have decided to adjust the planting structure, focus on small-season crop production, and promote autumn harvests to achieve a significant breakthrough in summer grain production next year.

To ensure the completion of the small-season crop production tasks, the province has established autumn sowing leadership groups at all levels to specifically command the autumn sowing production. Nearly 10 million laborers are working in the fields across the province. Nine prefectures, cities, and districts have organized nearly 10,000 cadres and more than 6,000 agricultural technology personnel to go to the countryside and set up work stations. Meanwhile, relevant industries across the province have ensured and implemented the allocation of agricultural materials and investment, laying a solid foundation for the province to achieve high yields of wheat.

    贵州调整种植结构  力争扭转缺粮状况
    本报贵阳11月15日电　记者潘帝都、胡跃平报道：贵州省果断调整粮食种植结构，大力扩种小季，力争多产粮食，以尽快扭转长期以来粮食靠调进的被动局面。今年全省小季种植计划面积达2000万亩，占总耕地71.5％，比去年增加近200万亩。
    “八山一水一分田”的贵州，人均耕地不到1亩，加上土地瘠薄，自然灾害连年不断，全省粮食年总产多年在650万吨上下徘徊。针对当地农村普遍存在着重大季轻小季的倾向，省委、省政府决定：调整种植结构，大抓小季生产，以夏促秋，力争明年夏粮有较大突破。
    为确保小季生产任务的完成，全省上下层层成立了秋种领导小组，具体负责指挥秋种生产。全省有近千万个劳动力奋战在田间地头。9个地、州、市组织了近万名干部和6000多名农业科技人员下乡蹲点。同时，全省有关行业在农用物资调配、资金投入等方面，都给予保证和落实，为全省夺取小麦高产打下良好基础。
