According to statistics from Western economic research institutions, India is the world's fourth-largest debtor nation, following Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. Figures released by the Indian government in April of this year indicate that by the end of March 1988, India's total external debt was approximately $42.5 billion, with a debt repayment ratio of 24%, approaching the internationally recognized danger line of 25%.

Faced with the increasingly severe debt problem, India has chosen to increase exports and reduce imports simultaneously, strive to attract concessional loans and deposits from overseas Indians, and rationally arrange the use of foreign exchange to address the debt issue.

In recent years, the Rajiv Gandhi government in India has formulated a series of policies and measures to encourage exports, leading to significant improvements in India's export situation. However, the growth rate of India's imports has not been controlled. According to recent figures released by the Indian government, India's trade deficit for the 1988-1989 fiscal year was $5 billion. In this context, the Indian government has recognized that while vigorously increasing exports, it is also necessary to take concrete measures to curb imports and reduce the trade deficit. To this end, while ensuring exports and the necessary imports for modernization, India has significantly reduced the import of components and parts used in the production of high-end consumer goods. India has also established a "time table system" for the domestic production of imported components and materials within a certain period, as a necessary condition for approving imports.

Seeking loans and investments, and increasing foreign exchange inflows, is another major measure taken by the Indian government to ease the imbalance in foreign exchange receipts and payments. According to official Indian statistics, in the 1987-1988 fiscal year alone, international financial institutions such as the World Bank, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International Development Association, and Asian Development Bank, the "India Aid Consortium," and some countries promised to provide various concessional loans and aid totaling $7 billion to India, including $800 million in grants. A large amount of loans and aid not only eased India's immediate foreign exchange shortages and insufficient debt repayment capacity but also played a positive role in strengthening industrial infrastructure construction and enhancing export capabilities.

The use of preferential measures to attract a large amount of remittances from overseas Indians has played a role in helping the Indian government overcome foreign exchange shortages. Currently, there are more than 10 million overseas Indians living around the world. To attract deposits from overseas Indians in Indian banks, the Reserve Bank of India has adopted various preferential measures. For example, the annual interest rate for overseas Indian rupee savings is two percentage points higher than the annual interest rate for ordinary rupee savings in India. As a result, in the last three quarters of 1988 alone, overseas Indian foreign exchange savings increased by $1.2 billion. During the same period, overseas Indian rupee savings increased by 45.7 billion rupees (approximately $350 million). Due to the adoption of the above measures, India has not experienced a debt crisis and maintains a good reputation for debt repayment.

    印度采取措施解决债务问题
    赵小树
    据西方经济研究机构的统计，印度是继巴西、墨西哥和阿根廷之后世界上第四大债务国。印政府今年4月公布的数字表明，截至1988年3月底，印度外债总额约425亿美元，偿债率为24％，已接近世界上公认的25％的危险线。
    面对日趋严重的债务问题，印度选择增加出口和减少进口并重、努力吸收优惠贷款和印侨存款、以及合理安排使用外汇的办法来解决债务问题。
    近年来，印度拉·甘地政府制定了一系列鼓励出口的政策和措施，印出口情况大有好转。然而，印度进口的增长速度却没有得到控制。根据印政府最近公布的数字，印1988至1989年度的外贸赤字50亿美元。在这种情况下，印度政府认识到，在大力增加出口的同时，还必须采取切实措施抑制进口，减少贸易赤字。为此，以保证出口和为实现现代化所必须的进口为前提，印度大幅度削减了用于生产高级消费品的散件和零部件的进口。印度还建立了进口部件、材料在一定期限内实现国产化的“时间表制度”，作为审批进口的必要条件。
    寻求贷款和投资、增加外汇流入，是印度政府缓和外汇收支不平衡矛盾的另一主要措施。据印官方统计，仅1987至1988年度，世界银行、国际复兴开发银行、国际开发协会和亚洲开发银行等国际金融机构、“援印财团”和一些国家向印度承诺提供的各种优惠贷款和援助达70亿美元，其中赠款为8亿美元。大量的贷款和援助不仅缓解了印度外汇短缺和外债偿还力不足的当务之急，并且对加强工业的基础设施建设、增强出口能力起到了积极的作用。
    以提供优惠的办法大量吸收侨汇在印度政府克服外汇不足的困难中发挥了作用。目前，旅居世界各地的印侨共1000多万。为吸引印侨在印度银行存款，印度储备银行采取了种种优惠措施。例如，印侨卢比储蓄的年息比印国内普通卢比储蓄的年息高二个百分点。这样，仅1988年的后三个季度，印侨外汇储蓄就增加了12亿美元。同期，印侨卢比储蓄增加了45.7亿卢比（约3.5亿美元）。由于采取了上述措施，印迄今没有发生债务危机，且还债信誉良好。
