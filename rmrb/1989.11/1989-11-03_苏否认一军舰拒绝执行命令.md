The Soviet military newspaper *Red Star* on November 1st refuted rumors that the Soviet nuclear missile-carrying cruiser "Kirov" entered Icelandic territorial waters and refused to follow orders from the Navy General Staff.

The report stated that this cruiser has been docked at the pier since August this year and has not gone to sea. The report quoted the deputy political commissar of the cruiser, Captain First Rank Pugachyov, as saying that only those with anti-Soviet sentiments would spread such rumors.

    苏否认一军舰拒绝执行命令
    苏联军报《红星报》十一月一日就传说苏联运载核导弹的“基洛夫”号巡洋舰进入冰岛领海并拒绝执行海军总参谋部命令一事进行辟谣。
    该报说，这艘巡洋舰从今年八月起就停泊在码头上没有出海。报道引用这艘巡洋舰上负责政治工作的副舰长普加乔夫海军中校的话说，只有头脑发烧的反苏分子才会造这样的谣言。
