Ford Motor Company of the United States will spend a large sum of money to acquire the famous British "Jaguar" automobile manufacturing company.

The board of directors of Jaguar Automobile Company announced today that they agreed to sell their company, known for producing high-end sedans, to Ford. The deal is worth 1.6 billion pounds.

Two days ago, the British government withdrew its "crucial" shares in the company, thus no longer being able to block the sale.

Jaguar Automobile Company's profit for the first half of last year was 22.5 million pounds, while this year's profit for the same period was only 14 million pounds. News of the sale immediately made Jaguar a key target for major automobile manufacturers around the world.

The second-largest automaker in the world, Ford, began buying shares of Jaguar in October and by last week, it had acquired 13.2% of the company's shares, becoming its largest shareholder. This move allowed Ford to outmaneuver the world's top automaker, General Motors, and acquire Jaguar. This acquisition is strategically significant for Ford's expansion in the European and American markets.

British Liberal Democrats complained that Britain's automobile manufacturing industry is being "sent to the trash heap." However, the head of Ford's European division, Herrstedt, explained that after Ford takes over Jaguar, the sales of Jaguar cars around the world will increase, which will be beneficial to the British economy.

    美国福特汽车公司收购英“美洲虎”公司
    新华社伦敦11月2日电  美国福特汽车公司将出巨资盘购英国著名的“美洲虎”汽车制造公司。
    “美洲虎”汽车公司董事会今天宣布同意向福特公司出售他们这家以生产高级轿车闻名的公司。交易的金额将达16亿英镑。
    两天前，英国政府抽回了它在这家公司“举足轻重”的股份，从而不再能阻止它转手。
    “美洲虎”汽车公司去年上半年利润达2250万英镑而今年同期的利润只有1400万英镑。消息传出，“美洲虎”公司立即成为世界各大汽车生产商争夺的重要目标。
    名列世界汽车行业第二位的福特公司从上个月起开始购买“美洲虎”公司的股份，截至上个星期，它已掌握了该公司13.2％的股权，成为其最大的股东，从而战胜世界头号汽车商美国通用汽车公司，将“美洲虎”收归己有。这对于福特公司扩大在欧美市场的影响具有战略意义。
    英国自由民主党人士抱怨说，英国的汽车制造业正被“送往垃圾堆”。而福特公司欧洲部主任赫尔斯特德解释说，福特接管“美洲虎”公司后，将使“美洲虎”牌汽车在世界各地的销量上升，对英国经济有益无害。
