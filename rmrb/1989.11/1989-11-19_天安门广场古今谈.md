Tiananmen Square has a history of over a thousand years. As early as the Yuan Dynasty's Dadu, there was already a square in front of the main gate of the imperial palace. In the early Ming Dynasty, with the reconstruction of the city walls of Beijing, the square was moved south and expanded. After the construction of the Tiananmen Gate, there was a "丁" shaped square to the south, surrounded by red walls and yellow tiles. This is the predecessor of today's Tiananmen Square.

At that time, Tiananmen Square had two gates on the east and west sides of the north street, named "Chang'an Left Gate" and "Chang'an Right Gate," respectively. The current East and West Chang'an Streets are named after these gates. In the 19th year of the Qing Dynasty's Qianlong reign (1754), two "Three Gates" were built outside the East and West Chang'an Gates. The West Three Gates are located at the south entrance of the present Furong Street, and the East Three Gates are between the present Nanchizi and Nanheyan. After expanding the south side wall, the original "丁" shaped square was enlarged and extended, with an area of nine hectares at that time. During the feudal imperial era, Tiananmen Square was a palace square, strictly forbidden to the common people.

After liberation, the former palace square in front of Tiananmen Gate has truly become a people's square. In September 1949, Tiananmen Square was renovated, and the road surface was expanded by 38,700 square meters. In 1950, the two pairs of stone lions and one pair of ornamental columns in front of Tiananmen Gate were moved east and west, expanding the road surface of the Golden Water Bridge. In 1952, the East and West Three Gates were demolished. On August 1, the construction of the Monument to the People's Heroes began, designed by the famous Chinese architect Liang Sicheng, and completed in April 1958. In 1958, the Great Hall of the People was built to the west of Tiananmen Square. The area of Tiananmen Square reached forty hectares.

    天安门广场古今谈
    天安门广场距今已有一千多年的历史。早在元大都时，宫城正门外已有广场，明初随北京城垣的改建，广场南移并加以扩大，承天门建设成后，南面有红墙黄瓦围起来的
  “丁”字形广场，这即是我们现在天安门广场的前身。
    当时天安门广场，北部横街的东西两侧各开一门，分别叫做“长安左门”和“长安右门”，现在的东西长安街就是因此而得名的。清代乾隆十九年（1754年）在东西长安门外各建两座“三座门”，西三座门位置在现在的府右街南口，东三座门在现在的南池子、南河沿之间。自扩建南侧围墙，就把原丁字形广场扩大和延长了，当时广场面积达九公顷之多。在封建帝王时代，天安门广场是宫廷广场，是严禁老百姓涉足的。
    解放以后，天安门前这个旧日的宫廷广场，已经转化为名副其实的人民广场了。1949年9月整修了天安门广场，扩建了路面38700平方米。1950年将天安门前两对石狮及一对华表向东、西方向移动，扩大了金水桥路面面积；1952年拆除了东西三座门。8月1日人民英雄纪念碑工程正式开工，是由我国著名建筑师梁思成设计的，1958年4月完工。1958年天安门广场西建起人民大会堂。天安门广场面积达到了四十公顷。
