    Water Pollution: This refers to the phenomenon where water bodies undergo changes in their chemical, physical, biological, or radioactive characteristics due to the introduction of certain substances. These changes affect the effective use of water, endanger human health, or damage the ecological environment, leading to water quality deterioration.

    Toxic Pollutants: These are pollutants that, when directly or indirectly ingested by organisms, cause the organism or its offspring to become ill, exhibit abnormal behavior, undergo genetic mutations, experience physiological dysfunction, bodily deformation, or death.

    Pollutant Discharge: This involves the act of releasing pollutants into rivers, lakes, and oceans through methods such as pumping, overflowing, leaking, spraying, and dumping.
