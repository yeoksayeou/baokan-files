According to the CTK, the Czechoslovakian Communist Party Central Committee Politburo discussed the situation, which has escalated due to large-scale demonstrations in the capital, Prague, over the past few days.

The Czechoslovakian National Front Central Committee also held a meeting today to discuss the domestic situation.

It also pointed out that historical and current experiences have shown that constructive solutions cannot be found through confrontation.

To seek a way out of the current situation, the Czechoslovakian Communist Party leadership, headed by Jakes, met with the Czechoslovakian Social Democratic Party leadership, headed by Chairman Kucera. The Czechoslovakian Communist Party Central Committee Politburo member and First Secretary of the Prague Municipal Committee, Stetpan, met with the Archbishop of Prague, Tomashek. Jakes also met with the Soviet Ambassador to Czechoslovakia today.

Some Czechoslovakian leaders visited factories today to mobilize workers not to participate in the general strike called by the Student Strike Committee for November 27th.

The domestic situation in Czechoslovakia further escalated, with the sixth day of mass demonstrations in the capital, Prague, seeing an increase in participants. The slogans shouted were intense. The "Civic Forum" played a significant role in the demonstrations.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 23rd.

General Václavík, the Czechoslovakian Minister of Defense, emphasized in a television speech on the evening of the 23rd that the Czechoslovakian People's Army would always stand with the people, defending national interests and socialist achievements.

Václavík stated, "Some opposition organizations have made unrealistic and ultimatum-like demands, unjustly criticizing everything we have done in the past and defaming socialism. This is not the way forward."

The leadership of the Czechoslovakian People's Army held a meeting in Prague today and issued a statement emphasizing that the army actively supports the efforts of the Czechoslovakian Communist Party Central Committee and the government to overcome the complex social and political situation.

The statement pointed out that the Czechoslovakian People's Army is concerned about the development of the domestic situation. As the defender of the nation's freedom and sovereignty, it "opposes gambling with the fate of the nation and the lives of the people" and "opposes the anarchism incited by anti-socialist forces at home and abroad." It is "prepared to defend socialist achievements, freedom, and peace."

Jakes, the General Secretary of the Czechoslovakian Communist Party Central Committee, pointed out when meeting with representatives of miners on the 23rd that the Czechoslovakian Communist Party Central Committee advocates using political means to resolve the current tense domestic situation. The Central Committee plenary session to be held on the 24th will proceed in this spirit.

The Czechoslovakian Communist Party Central Committee Politburo member and First Secretary of the Prague Municipal Committee, Stetpan, revealed during a speech to workers at the Prague Skoda Works that there will be "personnel changes" at the Central Committee plenary session.

In the afternoon of the 23rd, approximately 400,000 people gathered in Wenceslas Square in the city center for a demonstration. The newly established "Civic Forum" was the main organizer of the demonstration.
