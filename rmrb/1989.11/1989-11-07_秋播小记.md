	Autumn sowing is in full swing in Funing County, Jiangsu Province. Several demonstration fields have attracted many visitors. The same land, the same seeds, everyone is sowing, but each has their own unique methods.

	The "Difficult to Learn" Dayu
	In Dayu Village, Yilin Town, a 500-acre demonstration field has been established, fully implementing no-till and rotary tillage technology. The field is as smooth as a mirror and as neat as a painting. On October 12th, the secretary of the Luqiao Town Longwo Village Party Branch visited and then sent the village director and the heads of the village production teams to see it. More than ten team leaders shook their heads: "It's hard to learn. Maybe we can manage ten or twenty acres, but not such a large area." They pointed out many difficulties: the land is owned by individual households, making it hard to unify the varieties; everyone works on their own, making it difficult to concentrate labor; the time is tight, and if not sown in time, it will delay the sowing season.

	So, how did Dayu solve these problems? On October 1st, the demonstration field started construction. The agricultural machinery service team of the village economic cooperative immediately dispatched eight tractors and eight oxen; the agricultural technology service team had already prepared the seeds and fertilizers; knowledge and benefits of no-till methods had been repeatedly publicized, making them well-known to everyone. Within the village economic cooperative, there is a team capable of hard work—the earthwork professional team. On October 4th, after the team leader gave the order, 85 people went to work, and half a day was enough to dig the three ditches inside and outside. If each household did it themselves, it would take at least ten days.

	The 500-acre field involves two and a half village production teams and 150 contracted households. With unified command and reasonable dispatch, there was no idle time and no chaos. Is Dayu hard to learn? Why can't the economic cooperative in your place provide these services to the farmers? Why can't the cadres in your place play an organizational and leadership role like those in Dayu?

	The Joy of Farming in Xiyuan
	"Grandpa, have you sown your wheat yet?" "Yes, yes, now it's all machine tilling." These words were spoken by Wang Weicheng from Xiyuan Village, Shizhuang Township.

	Xiyuan Village has 1,968 people and 1,412 acres of cultivated land, with a total of 109 machines including tractors, water pumps, soil loosening machines, rotary tillers, and cotton sowing machines. Since the implementation of the household contract responsibility system, the village has been practicing a dual-layer management system. The village collective is responsible for "six unifications" (including seed supply, seedling supply, irrigation, machine tilling, plant protection, and technology promotion), with all expenses borne by the collective. The contracted households are responsible for fertilization and field management, completing the state procurement tasks.

	In the field, farmer Wang Qijin explained to us: he farms 3.6 acres of contracted land. This year, he harvested 1,055 kilograms of wheat in the summer and 1,900 kilograms of rice in the autumn, using a total of 600 kilograms of fertilizer, some at the base price and some at a higher price, with an investment of less than 80 yuan per acre.

	"We love farming in our village. Last year, the per capita income was over 1,000 yuan!" Wang Qijin said.

	Xiyuan Village has a relatively strong collective economy. The village operates a sand mine and several small factories, earning more than 200,000 yuan annually, which is used to subsidize and support agriculture. However, the village has not yet established an economic cooperative. Village Party Secretary Xia Zhenguo said: "We are actively creating conditions and plan to establish an economic cooperative organization next year to strengthen the service functions for planting and breeding industries."

	It seems that the key is not the form, but the content. Xiyuan is even harder to learn than Dayu!

	Light Shines Through the Party Members
	Guangming Village in Wutan Township also has a demonstration field, covering 700 acres, even larger than Dayu Village's, and is truly impressive.

	Guangming Village's collective economy is not strong, with only one small factory earning 3,000 yuan annually for the village's accumulation, making it impossible to implement welfare policies for agriculture.

	So, how does Guangming Village manage to do so well?

	Among the contracted households in this demonstration field, there are eight cadres and thirteen Communist Party members. The success of the demonstration field relies on them. Building bridges, roads, and drainage ditches requires land, and the party members' land is taken first; for voluntary labor, for every one person from the masses, party members contribute two or three, even ten. In 1982, during the implementation of the household contract responsibility system, this field was divided into small plots, making it difficult to unify the crop layout. In 1985 and 1988, two adjustments were made, and each time, party members first gave good land to the masses and took the poorer land for themselves. There has never been a quarrel among the cadres, the masses, or among the masses themselves over land adjustments. Over the years, Guangming Village has formed a style: sowing quickly, harvesting quickly, and completing the procurement tasks quickly.

	Putting others first, working hard, uniting the masses, and pooling wisdom—Guangming Village's experience has universal significance.

    秋播小记
    方群
    江苏省阜宁县秋收秋种正忙，几处秋播样板田，引来几多观光者。一样的地，一样的种，你也种，我也种，各有巧妙不同。
    “难学”的大余
    益林镇大余村，搞了一片五百亩的样板田，全部施行免耕、旋耕新技术。一块田，平如镜，方如画。十月十二日，罗桥乡龙窝村支部书记看毕回去，又让村民主任带着村民小组长来看。十多个小组长看了，却摇头：“难学，搞它十亩、二十亩还可以，这么大一片，搞不了。”他们举出诸多难办之处：地在各家各户手里，品种难以统一；各人干各人的，劳力难以集中；时间紧，不能及时下种，反误了农时。
    那么，大余是如何解决这些问题的呢？十月一日，这片样板田动工，村经济合作社所属的农机服务组，立即调来八台拖拉机、八条耕牛；农技服务组早已把种子、化肥准备好；有关免耕法的知识、好处，也都已反复宣传，家喻户晓。在村经济合作社里，还有一支能打硬仗的队伍——土方专业队。十月四日，开挖内外三沟，队长一声令下，八十五人上阵，半天就挖好了。假如一家一户自个干，拖上十天、八天也不止。
    五百亩田，涉及两个半村民小组一百五十户承包户，统一指挥，调度有方，没窝工，没打乱仗。大余难学么？你那里的经济合作社为什么不能向农民提供这些服务？为什么不能像大余的干部那样发挥组织、领导作用？
    西园种田乐
    “大爷，你家麦子种了没有？”“种了，种了，如今都是机器耕种。”说这话的，是施庄乡西园村的王为成。
    西园村一千九百六十八人，一千四百一十二亩耕地，现有拖拉机、抽水机、开墒机、旋耕机、棉播机共一百零九台。自大包干以来，一直搞的双层经营。村集体负责“六统一”（包括供种、供秧、排灌、机耕、植保、技术推广），全部费用由集体承担。承包户负责施肥、田间管理，完成国家定购任务。
    在田头，农民王其进给我们算了一笔帐：他种三点六亩责任田，今年，夏季收麦子一千零五十五公斤，秋季收稻子一千九百公斤，共施六百公斤化肥，有平价，有高价，每亩投资不足八十元。
    “我们村的人乐意种田，去年人均收入一千多元哩！”王其进说道。
    西园村集体经济实力较强。村里办了一个沙矿、几家小厂，每年收益二十多万元，重点补贴、扶持农业。可是，这个村至今未建经济合作社。村支书夏正国说：“我们正积极创造条件，打算明年建立经济合作组织，加强对种植业、养殖业的服务功能。”
    看来，重要的不在于形式，而在于内容。西园比大余更难学！
    光明靠党员
    吴滩乡光明村也有一块样板田，七百亩，比大余村的还大，令人叹为观止。
    光明村集体经济实力不算强，一家小厂，每年上交村积累三千元，无法对农业搞“福利政策”。
    光明村靠什么搞得这样好呢？
    在这块样板田的承包户中，有八名干部、十三名共产党员。搞样板田，靠的就是他们。修桥、修路、挖排水沟，要占地，先占党员的；出义务工，群众出一个，党员出两三个，甚至十个。一九八二年搞大包干时，这块田分割较碎，不宜统一茬口布局。一九八五年、一九八八年先后两次小调整，每次调整，党员首先把好田让给群众，差田分给自己。干群之间、群众之间，没有为调田发生过一次争吵。几年来，光明村形成这样一种作风：种得快，收得快，完成定购任务快。
    先人后己，艰苦奋斗，团结群众，群策群力——光明村的经验具有普遍的意义。
