    China's Kiwifruit Varieties Rank Among the World's Best

    According to Xinhua News Agency in Zhengzhou on November 8, materials provided at the recent Sixth National Kiwifruit Scientific Research Cooperation Symposium held in Zhengzhou indicate that after years of investigation into China's kiwifruit plants, it has been discovered that there are 57 species, 39 varieties, and 5 subtypes. This shows that China is the country with the most kiwifruit species, the widest distribution, and the largest reserves of wild fruit in the world.

    Known as the "King of Fruits," the global number of kiwifruit varieties is less than 60. It is currently a highly prized fruit being developed by many countries around the world. China's investigation into kiwifruit genetic resources began in 1978 and was completed in the first half of this year. The investigation shows that the Chinese kiwifruit and the delicious kiwifruit, which are distributed south of the Qinling Mountains, the Huai River, and the Yangtze River, are the two species with the highest economic value and the largest natural reserves, with an annual reserve of about 150,000 tons.

    我猕猴桃品种列世界前茅
    据新华社郑州11月8日电　（记者解国记）日前在郑州召开的全国第六次猕猴桃科研协作座谈会提供的材料表明，经过近年来对我国猕猴桃属植物的调查，发现它的种类多达57个种、39个变种和5个变型，这表明我国是世界上猕猴桃种类最多、分布最广、野生果实蕴藏量最大的国家。
    号称“水果之王”的猕猴桃全世界的品种不足60个，它是目前世界许多国家竞相发展的名贵果品之一。我国对猕猴桃种质资源调查，是1978年开始的，于今年上半年结束。调查表明，分布在秦岭、淮河、长江以南的中华猕猴桃和美味猕猴桃是经济价值最高，自然蕴藏量最多的两个种，年蕴藏量约15万吨。
