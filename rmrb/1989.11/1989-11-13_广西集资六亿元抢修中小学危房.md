Guangxi Raises Six Hundred Million Yuan to Repair Dangerous School Buildings

People's Daily, Nanning, November 12 — Correspondent Jiang Yaojiang reports: Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, despite financial difficulties and low incomes among the populace, has prioritized education. From March 1988 to the present, the region has raised 615 million yuan to repair dangerous school buildings in primary and secondary schools.

In recent years, the problem of dangerous school buildings in Guangxi has been severe. According to a survey by relevant departments at the beginning of last year, the total area of school buildings in primary and secondary schools in the region was 30.193 million square meters, with 7.47 million square meters identified as dangerous, accounting for 24.74% of the total school building area. The People's Government of the Autonomous Region issued an urgent notice in March last year, calling on the people of the entire region to think about the healthy growth of future generations and the improvement of national quality, and to contribute money and effort.

All levels of government in the region have included the repair of dangerous school buildings in the performance evaluation indicators for leading cadres, with responsibilities assigned at each level. Lu-chuan County originally raised 2.6 million yuan to build a county committee office building. After receiving the notice from the Autonomous Region Government, the county used all of this money to repair dangerous school buildings.

It is understood that from March last year to the present, the region has repaired 3.772 million square meters of dangerous buildings; demolished 3 million square meters of severely dangerous buildings, and built 2.33 million square meters of new school buildings, with 1.33 million square meters under construction; the proportion of dangerous school buildings in the total school building area has been reduced to 3.38%.

    广西集资六亿元抢修中小学危房
    本报南宁11月12日电  记者蒋耀强报道：广西壮族自治区在财政困难、群众收入不高的情况下，注重办教育。1988年3月至今，全区已集资6.15亿元，用于抢修中小学危房。
    近几年来，广西中小学危房问题十分突出。据有关部门去年初的调查，全区原有中小学校舍总面积3019.3万平方米，发现危房747万平方米，占校舍总面积24.74％。自治区人民政府于去年3月发出关于抢修中小学危房的紧急通知，号召全区人民为子孙后代的健康成长和民族素质的提高着想，有钱出钱，有力出力。
    全区各级政府把抢修中小学危房列入领导干部政绩考核指标，层层落实责任。陆川县原筹集26万元拟建县委办公大楼，接到自治区政府的通知后，将这笔资金全部用于抢修中小学的危房。
    据悉，去年3月至今，全区已维修危房377.2万平方米；推倒严重危房300万平方米，新建校舍233万平方米，在建校舍133万平方米；中小学危房占校舍总面积的比例已减少到3.38％。
