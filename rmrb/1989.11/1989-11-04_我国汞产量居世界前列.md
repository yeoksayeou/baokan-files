China's annual mercury production has now reached 900 tons, placing it among the world's leading producers. Forty years ago, China's mercury production was virtually zero.

Mercury is a crucial raw material for the production of mercury lamps and mercury rectifiers, and it is widely used in the chemical, defense, and scientific measurement industries. It is a highly valuable non-ferrous metal with extensive industrial applications. It is understood that most of China's mercury is produced in Guizhou Province. The mercury reserves and production of the Wanshan Mercury Mine in Guizhou rank first in the country, earning it the title of "China's Mercury Capital."

    我国汞产量居世界前列
    据新华社北京十一月三日电　（通讯员何文品）我国汞的年产量目前已达到九百吨，位居世界前列，而四十年前我国的汞产量几乎为零。
    汞是制造水银灯及汞整流器的重要原料，并广泛应用于化工、军工科学测量仪器中，是一种工业应用价值很高的有色金属。据了解，我国的汞大部分产自贵州省。贵州万山汞矿的储量和产量均占全国第一位，被称为中国的“汞都”。
