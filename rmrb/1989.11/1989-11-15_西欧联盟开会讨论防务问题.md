People's Daily, Brussels, November 13th. 

Today morning, the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Defense of the Western European Union held a meeting in Brussels to discuss issues related to the defense of Western Europe.

The attendees focused on the following issues:
1. Establishing a European defense organization to raise awareness about security. The Western European Union advocates that despite the current easing of East-West relations, "defense measures should not be abandoned."
2. Setting up a "European Military Satellite Bureau" to provide means for Western Europe to participate in the implementation of agreements on the verification of conventional arms reduction talks in the future, breaking the monopoly of the two superpowers on verification.
3. Regarding how to strengthen the "European pillar" within NATO, the meeting is preparing to propose suggestions on the role of the Western European Union in conventional arms negotiations.
4. Regarding how the Western European Union will coordinate with other European institutions such as the European Community in security matters.

The Western European Union was established in 1955 and currently has 9 members: Belgium, West Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain, and Portugal. The union's policies on defense and East-West relations are basically consistent with NATO, but it places more emphasis on European security and defense.

    西欧联盟开会讨论防务问题
    本报布鲁塞尔11月13日电　记者魏崴报道：今天上午，西欧联盟理事会外长和国防部长会议在布鲁塞尔开幕，讨论西欧防务等问题。
    与会者着重磋商下列几个问题：1、创设一个欧洲防务机构，以唤起人们对安全的认识。西欧联盟主张，尽管东西方关系当前趋于缓和，但“不应放弃防务措施”。2、成立“欧洲军用卫星局”，为西欧将来参与核查裁减常规军备谈判协议的执行情况提供手段，打破两个超级大国垄断核查的局面。3、关于如何加强北约中的“欧洲支柱”问题，会议准备就发挥西欧联盟在常规军备谈判中的作用，提出建议。4、关于西欧联盟如何与欧洲共同体等其它欧洲机构在安全方面相互协调的问题。
    西欧联盟于1955年成立，现在成员为9个：比利时、西德、法国、英国、意大利、荷兰、卢森堡、西班牙和葡萄牙。该联盟在防务与东西方关系政策方面与北约基本一致，但更强调欧洲安全和防务。
