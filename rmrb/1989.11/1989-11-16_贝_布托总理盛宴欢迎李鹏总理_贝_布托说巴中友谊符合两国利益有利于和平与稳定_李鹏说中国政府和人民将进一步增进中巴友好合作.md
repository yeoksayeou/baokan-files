Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto tonight emphasized that the friendship between Pakistan and China is a model of relations between two countries of different sizes and with different social, economic, and political systems. The Pakistan-China friendship serves the fundamental interests of both countries and has made an important contribution to peace and stability in this region.

Benazir Bhutto made these remarks at a grand banquet held at the Presidential Palace to welcome Li Peng.

Tonight, the brightly lit banquet hall of the Presidential Palace was filled with a warm atmosphere of Pakistan-China friendship. The tables were adorned with colorful fresh flowers. Li Peng and his wife Ju Lin, accompanied by Benazir Bhutto and her husband Asif Ali Zardari, entered the banquet hall as the orchestra played the national anthems of both countries.

In her speech, Benazir Bhutto said that her talks with Li Peng this afternoon showed that "Pakistan and China have similar or consistent views on major international and regional issues. More importantly, we both believe that our friendship serves the fundamental interests of our two peoples and is also beneficial for peace and stability."

Benazir Bhutto recalled her visit to China earlier this year. She said, "That visit allowed our democratic government and people to renew old friendships and make new ones. The cooperation extended by the Chinese government, as well as my meetings with the elder leaders Deng Xiaoping, Yang Shangkun, and Li Peng, made my visit a great success and further strengthened our relationship."

Benazir Bhutto praised China's achievements over the past 40 years. She said, "We believe that a strong and prosperous China will continue to play an indispensable role as a bastion for maintaining peace and stability in this region."

When discussing Pakistan's foreign relations, Benazir Bhutto said that Pakistan, like China, prioritizes friendly relations with neighboring countries. She has had the opportunity to establish close relationships with most South Asian and Southeast Asian countries, as well as with brotherly Muslim countries in the Middle East. Pakistan advocates for peaceful and cooperative relations with all countries in the region.

She also mentioned Pakistan's progress in normalizing relations with India. Benazir Bhutto said, "We are prepared to discuss confidence-building measures with India, including arms reduction and preventing nuclear proliferation. Our region needs a sense of security and mutual trust. Only when the relationships between South Asian countries are guided by the principle of peaceful coexistence and political solutions to outstanding disputes can we achieve this goal."

Regarding the Afghanistan issue, she said that Pakistan believes that only a broad-based government that enjoys the support of the Afghan people can ultimately resolve the Afghanistan issue. Only then will it be possible for millions of Afghan refugees to return to their homes safely and with dignity.

She pointed out, "The most enlightening lesson we have learned from the events in Afghanistan and Cambodia is that the international community can only establish a more stable and just world order by actively opposing foreign military intervention and occupation."

Li Peng, in his speech, said, "Pakistan is the first country I am visiting in South Asia. The Pakistani people are hardworking, brave, and enterprising. They have worked diligently and achieved great success in building their own country. The Pakistani government pursues an independent and non-aligned peaceful foreign policy, adheres to principles, and advocates for justice in international affairs, playing an increasingly important role."

Li Peng said, "Maintaining world peace and promoting common economic development are the most pressing concerns of the people of all countries today. Despite differences in social systems and ideologies, the common interest in seeking peace and development requires people to face reality, acknowledge the diversity of the world, and conduct exchanges based on internationally accepted principles of interstate relations. Historical experience has proven that the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence are fundamental principles that have withstood the test of time and can truly ensure harmonious relations between countries. For the sake of world peace and development, the Chinese government advocates for the establishment of a new international political order and a new international economic order based on the five principles. We are willing to work with all countries in the world to make positive contributions to this end."

He pointed out, "While we see a trend towards easing international tensions, it is regrettable that the world is still not peaceful. Phenomena such as bullying the weak, imposing one's will on others, and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries still threaten world peace and stability."

Regarding the Afghanistan issue, he expressed his appreciation for the Pakistani government's consistent principled stance on the Afghanistan issue, providing generous humanitarian aid to 3 million Afghan refugees, and making tireless efforts and valuable contributions to seeking a comprehensive political solution.

Li Peng pointed out that China and South Asian countries, like most countries in the world, hope that the various political forces in Afghanistan will prioritize national reconciliation and regional peace, resolve issues through peaceful negotiations, establish a broad-based coalition government, and restore Afghanistan's peace, neutrality, and non-aligned status as soon as possible, so that the Afghan people can rebuild their homes in a peaceful environment.

Li Peng said, "China and South Asian countries are neighbors and developing countries. Historically, we have had similar experiences, and today we all face the common task of developing our economies and improving the lives of our people. Experience has shown that the development of a country mainly relies on self-reliance and hard work, as well as mutual learning and complementary strengths. We will continue to work hard to develop friendly neighborly relations with South Asian countries. We also sincerely hope that South Asian countries can handle their relations based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence, develop regional cooperation, and contribute to peace, stability, and prosperity in the South Asian region."

When discussing the domestic situation in China, Li Peng said, "This spring and summer, a counter-revolutionary rebellion aimed at overthrowing the People's Republic and the legitimate government of China was suppressed in Beijing. Our country has withstood a severe test. Now the situation across the country is stable, and social order has basically returned to normal. Our domestic and foreign policies have not changed. In the future, we will continue to adhere to the principle of one central task and two basic points, that is, focusing on economic construction, adhering to the four cardinal principles, and adhering to reform and opening up. This is the foundation of our country and the path to a strong nation."

When discussing Sino-Pakistani relations, he said that in the nearly 40 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, Sino-Pakistani relations have developed and consolidated under the joint efforts of the governments and peoples of both countries, becoming a model of friendly relations between countries with different social systems.

He said, "Looking back at the development of Sino-Pakistani relations, people may ask, why have China and Pakistan been able to maintain friendly cooperation for decades, unaffected by the changes in international political winds and domestic situations in both countries? In my view, the reason is very clear: first, the peoples of both countries have a firm belief in maintaining peace and friendship, and in various complex situations, they can trust and support each other. Second, the governments of both countries strictly adhere to the five principles of peaceful coexistence and do not interfere in each other's internal affairs. Years of practice have proven that our friendship can withstand the test of time and is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Since taking office as Prime Minister, Madam Benazir Bhutto has done a great deal of work to promote Sino-Pakistani friendship, especially her successful visit to our country in February, which has added new vitality to the development of bilateral relations. The Chinese government and people are determined to further promote friendly cooperation with Pakistan and continue to add bricks and tiles to the edifice of Sino-Pakistani friendship. I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm that in your country's efforts to maintain national independence, sovereignty, and national construction, the Chinese government and people will always be your reliable friends."

The speeches of both sides were frequently met with warm applause.

Accompanying Li Peng on his visit were Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin, and Vice Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army He Qizong, who were invited to attend the banquet.

Pakistan's attendees included Foreign Minister Yakub Khan, Senate Chairman Wasiim Sajjad, Speaker of the National Assembly Majeed Haider, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Sirohi.

Before the banquet ended, Pakistani musicians performed beautiful national music for the Chinese guests.

    贝·布托总理盛宴欢迎李鹏总理
    贝·布托说巴中友谊符合两国利益有利于和平与稳定
    李鹏说中国政府和人民将进一步增进中巴友好合作
    新华社伊斯兰堡11月14日电　（记者陈家保、李家声）巴基斯坦总理贝·布托今晚在这里强调，巴中友谊是两个大小不同、社会经济和政治制度各异的国家之间关系的典范。巴中友谊符合两国的根本利益，同时对这一地区的和平与稳定也作出了重要贡献。
    贝·布托是在总统府为欢迎李鹏总理举行的盛大宴会上发表上述讲话的。
    今晚，灯火辉煌的总统府宴会厅洋溢着巴中友好的热烈气氛。餐桌上摆着五颜六色的鲜花。李鹏和夫人朱琳在贝·布托和丈夫阿里·扎尔达里陪同下步入宴会厅时，乐队先后奏起两国国歌。
    贝·布托致词时说，她今天下午同李鹏举行的会谈表明，“巴基斯坦和中国对重大的国际和地区问题持有相似或一致的看法。更重要的是我们都认为我们的友谊有利于我们两国人民的根本利益，同时也有利于和平和稳定”。
    贝·布托回顾了今年早些时候她对中国的访问。她说：
  “那次访问使我们的民主政府和人民有机会重叙旧谊，结识新友。中国政府给予我们的合作，以及我同老一辈领导人邓小平阁下、杨尚昆主席和李鹏总理阁下的晤谈使我的访问取得巨大成果，并进一步加强了我们之间的关系。”
    贝·布托赞扬中国40年来取得的成就。她说：“我们认为一个强大的和繁荣的中国将作为维护本地区的和平与稳定的堡垒，继续发挥必不可少的作
  用。”
      贝·布托谈到巴基斯坦的对外关系时说，巴基斯坦同中国一样优先重视与邻国的友好关系。她有幸同大多数南亚和东南亚国家以及西亚的兄弟穆斯林国家建立了亲密关系。巴基斯坦主张同本地区所有国家建立和平合作关系。
    她还谈到巴基斯坦在谋求同印度关系正常化方面所取得的进展。贝·布托说：“我们准备同印度讨论包括裁减军备和防止核扩散等建立信任措施。我们这一地区需要安全感和互相信任的气氛。只有在南亚各国间的关系是以和平共处为指导原则并以政治方式解决各种突出的争议问题的情况下，我们才能达到这个目的。”
    她在谈到阿富汗问题时说，巴基斯坦认为，只有建立一个基础广泛的、能得到阿富汗人民拥护的政府才能最终解决阿富汗问题。只有到那时候，才有可能使数百万阿富汗难民安全和体面地返回自己家园。
    她指出：“我们从阿富汗和柬埔寨的事件中吸取的最有启发性的经验教训是，国际社会只有积极反对外来军事干涉和占领的情况下，才能建立一个更加稳定和公正的世界秩序。”
    李鹏总理在讲话中说：“巴基斯坦是我此次访问南亚的第一个国家。巴基斯坦人民勤劳勇敢，富于进取精神，在建设自己国家的事业中兢兢业业、辛勤劳动，取得了很大成就。巴基斯坦政府奉行独立和不结盟的和平外交政策，在国际事务中坚持原则、伸张正义，发挥着日益重要的作用。”
    李鹏说：“维护世界和平和共同发展经济，是当今各国人民最关心的事情。尽管各国之间存在着社会制度的不同和意识形态的差异，但谋求和平与发展的共同利益要求人们面对现实，承认世界的多样性，遵循彼此都接受的国际关系准则进行交往。历史经验证明，互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处五项原则，是经历了时间考验，证明能够真正保证国与国之间和睦相处的基本原则。为了世界和平和发展，中国政府主张在五项原则基础上建立国际政治新秩序和国际经济新秩序。我们愿意同世界各国一道，为此而作出自己的积极贡献。”
    他指出：“当我们看到国际局势趋向缓和的时候，令人遗憾地也看到，这个世界并不太平，以大欺小，恃强凌弱，将自己的意志强加于人，干涉别国内政等现象，依然危及世界的和平与稳定。”
    他在谈到阿富汗问题时表示赞赏巴基斯坦政府在阿富汗问题上一直坚持原则立场，为300万阿难民提供了慷慨的人道主义援助，并为寻求全面政治解决作出了不懈的努力和可贵的贡献。
    李鹏指出，中巴两国和世界大多数国家一样，都希望阿富汗各种政治力量以民族和解和地区和平的大局为重，通过和平协商，建立一个基础广泛的联合政府，早日恢复阿富汗的和平、中立和不结盟的地位，使阿富汗人民能够在和平的环境中重建家园。
    李鹏说：“中国和南亚国家毗邻，又都是发展中国家，历史上有过相似的遭遇，今天又都面临着发展经济、改善人民生活的共同任务。经验证明，
  一个国家的发展主要靠自力更生、艰苦奋斗，还要靠相互学习、取长补短。我们将继续为发展同南亚各国之间的睦邻友好关系做出自己的努力。我们也真诚希望南亚各国能够在和平共处五项原则的基础上，处理相互关系，发展区域合作，为南亚地区的和平、稳定与繁荣作出贡献。”
    李鹏在谈到中国国内形势时说：“今年春夏之交在北京平息了一场旨在颠覆人民共和国和推翻中国合法政府的反革命暴乱。我们的国家经受住了一场严峻的考验。现在全国形势稳定，社会秩序基本恢复正常。我们的内外政策没有改变。今后我们将一如既往，坚持一个中心、两个基本点，即以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，这是我国的立国之本，强国之路。”
    他在谈到中巴关系时说，两国建交近40年来，在两国政府和人民共同努力下，中巴关系得到不断的发展和巩固，已成为不同社会制度国家友好相处的典范。
    他说：“回顾中巴关系的发展，人们也许要问，为什么中巴两国能够数十年如一日，始终保持友好合作，而不受国际政治风云变幻和两国国内情况变化的影响呢？在我看来原因很清楚：一是两国人民都具有维护和平与友谊的坚定信念，因而在各种复杂情况下都能相互信任、互相支持。二是两国政府都恪守和平共处五项原则，互不干涉对方内部事务。多年来的事实证明，我们之间的友谊经得起时间的考验，中巴友谊深入人心。贝·布托阁下自从担任总理以来致力于发展中巴友谊做了大量工作，特别是今年2月对我国的成功访问，为两国关系的发展增添了新的活力。中国政府和人民决心进一步增进同巴基斯坦的友好合作，为中巴友谊大厦不断添砖加瓦。我愿借此机会重申，在贵国维护民族独立、主权和建设国家的事业中，中国政府和人民将永远是你们可以信赖的朋友。”
    双方的讲话不时博得热烈的掌声。
    随同李鹏总理来访的外交部长钱其琛、对外经济贸易部长郑拓彬、中国人民解放军副总参谋长何其宗应邀出席了宴
  会。  
    巴基斯坦方面出席宴会的有外交部长雅各布·汗、参议院主席瓦希姆·萨贾德、国民议会议长迈拉杰·哈立德以及三军参谋长联席会议主席赛罗希等。
    宴会结束前，巴基斯坦演奏家们为中国贵宾演奏了优美的民族乐曲。
