China's representative at the UN General Assembly's Special Political Committee calls for strengthening the role of UN peacekeeping operations

UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Yu Mengjia today at the 44th session of the UN General Assembly's Special Political Committee called for strengthening the role of UN peacekeeping operations and improving their effectiveness.

Yu Mengjia said that UN peacekeeping operations have achieved notable results in recent years. Following the deployment of the Good Offices Mission to Afghanistan and Pakistan and the Military Observer Group to Iran and Iraq, the UN this year also sent a Transitional Assistance Group to Namibia to help achieve its independence, facing arduous tasks.

Yu Mengjia proposed that to improve the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations, appropriate training should be provided to relevant personnel and other effective measures should be taken.

Yu Mengjia announced that the Chinese government has decided to send a small number of personnel to participate in peacekeeping operations, hoping to receive support and cooperation from all parties.

He said that China has always been committed to the important cause of maintaining international peace and security and is willing to work with the international community to achieve greater success in UN peacekeeping operations.

Last year, the 43rd session of the UN General Assembly approved China as a formal member of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. The Chinese government has decided to send 20 civilian personnel to Namibia to participate in the Transitional Assistance Group.

    我代表在联大政治特委会上呼吁
    加强联合国维持和平行动的作用
    中国决定派员赴纳参加援助团
    本报联合国10月31日电  记者刘开宸报道：中国代表俞孟嘉大使今天在第44届联大特别政治委员会会议上呼吁加强联合国维持和平行动的作用，提高其效能。
    俞孟嘉说，联合国维持和平行动近几年取得了可喜的成果。继向阿富汗和巴基斯坦派斡旋团和向两伊派军事观察团之后，联合国今年又向纳米比亚派出过渡时期援助团，为实现纳米比亚独立作出努力，其面临的任务也是艰巨的。
    俞孟嘉提出，为提高维持和平行动效能，需对有关人员进行适当训练和采取其它有效措施。
    俞孟嘉最后宣布，中国政府已决定派遣少数人员参加维持和平行动，希望得到各方的支持与合作。
    他表示中国一贯致力于维持国际和平与安全的重要事业，愿与国际社会一道，为联合国维持和平行动取得更大成功作出贡献。
    去年第43届联大批准中国为维持和平行动特委会正式成员，中国政府已决定派遣20名文职人员到纳米比亚参加过渡时期援助团。
