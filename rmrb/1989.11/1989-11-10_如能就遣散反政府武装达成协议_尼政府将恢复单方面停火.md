Nicaragua's government will resume a unilateral ceasefire if an agreement on disbanding anti-government forces is reached during direct talks between the government and anti-government forces scheduled for November 9-10 under the auspices of the United Nations.

President Daniel Ortega made this announcement to the press in Managua on November 8. He also revealed that the government will present a 15-point proposal during the upcoming talks.

Ortega stated that if the agreement is signed, the government will also "temporarily suspend" weapons imports by April 25, 1990.

Ortega added that if 50% of the anti-government forces are disbanded and kidnapped farmers are released by December 5 of this year as planned, the government will issue an amnesty to release individuals who have directly or indirectly participated in anti-government activities.

The government also proposed in its suggestions that it would agree to allow a delegation from the anti-government forces to return to the country to inspect the conditions for their return to the homeland.
