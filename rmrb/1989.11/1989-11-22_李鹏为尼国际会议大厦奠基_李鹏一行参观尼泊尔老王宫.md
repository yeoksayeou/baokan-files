Premier Li Peng and his wife visited the famous Hanuman Dhoka Old Royal Palace this afternoon.

When Premier Li Peng and his wife, Zhu Lin, arrived by car at the square in front of the Old Royal Palace, thousands of young children were neatly lined up on the dozens of steps leading to the surrounding temples, waving the national flags of Nepal and China, welcoming Premier Li Peng and his entourage.

The Chairman of the Kathmandu District Council, Tapa, the Acting Director of the Nepal Archaeological Department, Amaya, and officials from the Ministry of Culture welcomed Premier Li Peng and his wife at the entrance of the Old Royal Palace and presented them with flower garlands. Then, Premier Li and his entourage entered the spacious Nasal Royal Palace courtyard inside the Old Royal Palace. The courtyard is surrounded by three or four-story buildings. In the center of the courtyard, there is a stone-built coronation platform where King Birendra held his coronation ceremony in 1975.

After the visit, Premier Li Peng and his wife, Zhu Lin, went to the square to meet with the welcoming crowd, waving and greeting them frequently. The welcoming crowd responded with enthusiastic applause.
