Tiananmen (and Another Poem)
Hu Qiaomu

The pedestrian path in front of Tiananmen
I have walked and gazed so many times
Merging into the eastward and westward crowds
Lost in the laughter around me
Lost in wanting to sing, lost in wanting to dance
Lost in wanting to evaporate, lost in wanting to burn
Everything in front of Tiananmen is enticing
Everything in front of Tiananmen is embracing
You and I and he and she, can we dissolve in a dream?
No, no, we are creating together
Breathing, caressing this boiling life
This harvest of blood and sweat, this treasure in the heart
Walking and still wanting to walk, gazing and still wanting to gaze
To labor for you, to serve you
Even if we fall, our loyal souls
Will still fly to you, will still envelop you

The Song of Leshan Giant Buddha

Leshan has a giant Buddha, magnificent and unparalleled in East Asia.
Sitting alone by the river, receiving clouds and water, spanning a thousand years.
Tourists stand on his toes, looking up in awe, their worldly troubles momentarily forgotten.
In the past, steep cliffs stood in the raging currents, and boatmen were astonished by the peril.
The great monk Hai Tong had the peril removed, carving the Buddha to save the world.
With stern brows and piercing eyes, he rejected corrupt officials, fearing neither the crushing of bones nor the shredding of flesh.
The waterway is safe, not by divine power, but by virtue and skill, equally matched.
The mountains and waters of Leshan are all delightful; the main roads are flanked by grand buildings.
Three rivers converge, embracing the great river, half the sky slopes down, framing Mount Emei.
The scenery is splendid but not enough; a majestic statue tells a fine tale.
Having witnessed countless vicissitudes and troubles, the compassionate face cannot withstand the gunfire!
Spring light comes late, like a return home; restoration and protection are not yet finished.
People from all over the world come daily to pay homage, not just to worship the Buddha but to honor culture.
The craftsmen who made the Buddha numbered in the thousands, and to be a person is to follow the greatness of heaven and earth.
Ten billion souls reach for the heavens; the Buddha also looks up at China.

   天安门（外一首）
   胡乔木
   天安门前的人行大道
   我曾多少次边走边瞧
   投入东来西往的人流
   迷入左右前后的说笑
   迷着要歌唱　迷着要舞蹈
   迷着要蒸发　迷着要燃烧
   天安门前　一切在吸引
   天安门前　一切在拥抱
   你我他她　可消融在梦境？
   不不　我们在一同创造
   呼吸　爱抚　这沸腾的生活
   这血汗的收成　这心中的珍
    宝
   走了还要走　瞧了还要瞧
   要为你劳动　要向你报效
   纵然倒下　忠实的灵魂
   也向你飞来　将你萦绕

   乐山大佛歌
   乐山有大佛，壮伟冠东亚。
   独坐江边接云水，悠悠岁月千年跨。
   游人趾上仰弥高，烦恼红尘顿一划。
   昔时峭壁当激流，舟人到此鬼门讶。
   高僧海通志除危，凿山造像济天下。
   横眉抉目拒贪吏，粉骨碎身全不怕。
   航道平安岂神力？为德为艺差并驾。
   乐山山水皆可乐，通衢夹道连广厦。
   三川合抱大江投，半天斜落峨眉架。
   风景繁华未足多，巍然一尊传佳话。
   饱阅沧桑忧患频，慈容争奈弹火炸！
   春光迟到到如归，修整护持今未罢。
   四海人潮日日朝，来非礼佛礼文化。
   巨匠作佛等千人，作人合参天地大。
   十亿灵魂摩上苍，佛亦抬头看华夏。
