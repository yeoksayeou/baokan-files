	U.S. and Japan Discuss Bilateral Economic Issues
	Emphasize Improving Trade Imbalance

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 3, the United States and Japan began another round of consultations on bilateral economic relations and common international economic issues on November 3.

	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 5, the U.S.-Japan economic talks ended on November 4. Both sides emphasized that it is necessary to improve the trade imbalance between the two countries and strengthen cooperation on global economic issues.

	Richard McCormack, the U.S. chief negotiator and Deputy Secretary of State for Economic and Agricultural Affairs, said after the talks that he was concerned about the slowing pace of reduction in the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.

	The U.S. trade deficit with Japan in 1988 increased by 22% compared to 1987. Although the deficit for the first nine months of this year decreased by 9% compared to the same period last year, the rate of decline has slowed. Some predictions indicate that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan may continue to widen in the future.

	McCormack stated that the United States will work to reduce the budget deficit to improve the trade imbalance between the two countries, but Japan should also further expand domestic demand and open its market more to U.S. products.

	Due to Japan's recent increase in investment in U.S. manufacturing and real estate, some Japanese are concerned that the United States may take measures to restrict foreign investment.

	The Japanese negotiator, Watanabe Tsuneo, Deputy Director-General of the Economic Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that Japan will continue to work to expand domestic demand. He said that maintaining and strengthening the U.S.-Japan cooperative relationship is crucial for the development of the world economy and effectively addressing the current issues.

    美日商讨双边经济问题
    强调要改善两国间贸易不平衡状况
    据新华社华盛顿11月3日电　美国和日本3日开始再次就双边经济关系和共同关心的国际经济问题进行磋商。
    新华社华盛顿11月5日电美国和日本的经济会谈于4日结束。双方强调，改善两国间贸易不平衡状况和双方在全球经济问题上加强合作，是必要的。
    美国首席谈判代表、负责经济和农业事务的副国务卿理查德·麦科马克会后对记者说，他对美国与日贸易赤字下降的幅度放慢表示了关注。
    美国1988年的对日贸易赤字比1987年增加了22％，虽然今年头9个月的赤字比去年同期下降9％，但下降速度已放慢。一些预测表明，今后美对日贸易赤字可能会继续扩大。
    麦科马克表示，美国将努力减少预算赤字以改善两国的贸易不平衡状况，但日本也应进一步扩大国内需求，向美国产品更加开放市场。
    由于日本近年增加了对美国制造业和房地产的投资，一些日本人担心美国会采取措施限制外来投资。
    日方谈判代表、外务省负责经济事务的次官渡部恒三表示，日本将继续努力扩大国内的需求。他说，维护和加强日美合作关系对世界经济的发展和有效应付目前面临的问题是至关重要的。
