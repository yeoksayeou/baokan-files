The Chairman of the State Bank of the Soviet Union, Gryaznov, announced in an interview with *Pravda* on October 28 that starting from the beginning of next year, the exchange rate of the ruble with foreign currencies in trade transactions will be devalued by at least half. The current official exchange rate of the ruble with foreign currencies was set 28 years ago. At present, it is still 0.60-0.65 rubles to 1 U.S. dollar, but the actual value of the two currencies differs greatly.

According to the new exchange rate, starting from the beginning of next year, 1.20-1.30 rubles will be exchanged for 1 U.S. dollar. Even so, compared to the current black market exchange rate in the Soviet Union of 10-15 rubles to 1 U.S. dollar, there is still a significant gap in the actual value of the two currencies.

Earlier reports indicated that starting from November 1, the Soviet Union will change the exchange rate of the ruble with foreign currencies for non-trade transactions from the original 0.6-0.65 rubles to 1 U.S. dollar to 6.27 rubles to 1 U.S. dollar.

Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Abalkin, said on October 28 that after the implementation of the new exchange rate, foreign citizens or Soviet experts working abroad can sell foreign exchange at the new exchange rate. Soviet citizens traveling abroad for personal or official reasons will need to use nearly 2000 rubles (previously 200 rubles) to exchange for 300 U.S. dollars, thereby partially limiting the number of people traveling abroad.

    卢布同外币比价将贬值
    苏联国家银行行长格拉先科10月28日对《真理报》发表谈话宣布，从明年初起，在贸易业务中，卢布同外币的比价至少将贬值一半。现行的卢布同外币的官方比价是28年前确定的。目前，仍是0.60—0.65卢布兑换1美元，但两种货币的实际价值相差甚远。
    按新比价，从明年年初起，1.20—1.30卢布兑换1美元。即使这样，同目前苏联黑市上的比价——10至15卢布兑换1美元相比，两种货币的实际价值仍有相当大的差距。
    前报道，苏联从11月1日起，将非贸易业务的卢布同外币的比价由原来的0.6—0.65卢布兑换1美元改为6.27卢布兑换1美元。
    苏联部长会议副主席阿巴尔金10月28日说，新的比价实行后，外国公民或在国外工作的苏联专家可按新的比价出售外汇，苏联公民因私或因公出国则需用近2000卢布（原先是200卢布）兑换300美元，这样可部分限制出国人数。
