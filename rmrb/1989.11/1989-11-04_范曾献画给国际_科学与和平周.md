Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 3rd.

At last night's arts evening for the International "Science and Peace Week" held in Beijing, a touching scene unfolded: renowned painter Fan Zeng presented a meticulously crafted "Peace Dove." Zhou Peiyuan, representing the scientists, accepted the painting, prompting the audience to erupt in enthusiastic applause.

The "Peace Dove" is pure white, with crystal-clear red eyes, its head slightly raised, standing steadfastly on a six-foot sheet of rice paper, exuding a sense of strength and confidence.

On December 6th of last year, the United Nations announced that the week containing November 11th of each year would be designated as the "Science and Peace" International Week. China has decided to hold a series of "Love Science, Love Peace" activities from November 6th to 12th this year to respond to the United Nations' call.

"Developing science and maintaining peace" is the shared aspiration of people around the world. Upon hearing this news, painter Fan Zeng was filled with creative inspiration and, on the morning of October 30th, with a heart full of hope for humanity's future, he completed the "Peace Dove" in one stroke. He said, "Where there is peace, there is justice and light, and there is the endless creativity of artists." People sincerely wish that the "Peace Dove" will soar high with the strength of scientists.

    范曾献画给国际“科学与和平周”
    新华社北京11月3日电　（记者李光茹）昨晚在此间举行的国际“科学与和平周”文艺晚会上出现了动人情景：著名画家范曾献上精心绘制的“和平鸽”，周培源代表科学家们接过这幅画时，观众席上爆发出热烈掌声。
    这只“和平鸽”通体洁白，红色眼睛晶莹剔透，头微微昂起，稳稳地站在六尺宣纸上，给人以力量、自信的感觉。
    去年12月6日，联合国宣布：每年11月11日所属的一周为“科学与和平”国际周。我国决定今年11月6日至12日举行一系列“爱科学、爱和平”的活动，以响应联合国的号召。
    “发展科学，维护和平”是当今各国人民的共同愿望。画家范曾欣闻此事后，创作激情难捺，于10月30日清晨，满怀对人类明天的美好憧憬，将这只“和平鸽”一挥而就。他说：“哪里有和平，哪里才有正义、光明，才有艺术家生生不息的创造”。人们衷心地祝愿“和平鸽”凭着科学家的力量振翅高飞。
