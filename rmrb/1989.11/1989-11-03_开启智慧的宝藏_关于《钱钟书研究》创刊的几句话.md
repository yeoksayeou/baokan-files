The Cultural Arts Publishing House is launching "Money Zhongshu Studies," and I wholeheartedly agree with this initiative. Mr. Money's works and creations, as some comrades have said, are akin to a "cultural Kunlun," vast and profound. Reading Mr. Money's books is like entering a treasure mountain, finding treasures that bring honor and glory. However, Mr. Money's books are even more valuable than a treasure mountain. This is because the treasures on a mountain are finite; once taken, they are gone. Mr. Money's books, however, are like what Laozi said: "The more you give to others, the more you have; the more you share with others, the more you possess." Researchers who find treasures in Mr. Money's books and promote them will enable more people to know about the treasures hidden in his works, inspiring more people's wisdom. This is precisely how Mr. Money, through his books, "gives to others" and "shares with others." For those who have not read Mr. Money's books or know little about the treasures within, through the research and promotion by others, they will come to know the many treasures hidden in his works. Thus, the number of people inspired will increase, which is what Laozi meant by "the more you have, the more you give; the more you share, the more you possess."

Furthermore, different people may have different understandings of the treasures in Mr. Money's books. When they publish their research findings and exchange ideas, it will deepen everyone's understanding of the treasures hidden in his works. Therefore, I commend the publication of "Money Zhongshu Studies."

    开启智慧的宝藏
    ——关于《钱钟书研究》创刊的几句话
    周振甫
    文化艺术出版社创刊《钱钟书研究》，我非常赞同。钱先生的著作和创作，正如有的同志所说堪称“文化昆仑”，极为博大精深。读钱先生的书，有的如入宝山，得宝以为光宠。但钱先生的书，胜过宝山。因宝山上的宝物，被人取去一件就少一件。钱先生的书，其中所蕴藏的珍宝，像《老子》说的：“既以为人既愈有，既以与人己愈多。”研究者从钱先生的书中取得珍宝，加以宣扬，使更多人知道钱先生书中所蕴藏的珍宝，启发更多人的智慧，这正是钱先生通过他的书来“为人”和“与人”，而初读钱先生的书或未读钱先生的书者，对钱先生书中所蕴藏的珍宝或所知不多，或无所知者，经过有人对钱先生书的研究宣扬，也会知道钱先生书中蕴藏很多的珍宝。这样，受到启发的人越来越多，这就是《老子》说的“愈有”“愈多”了。再说，对钱先生书中的珍宝，各人的认识不一定相同，各人把他们研究成果发表出来，互相交换，对钱先生书中所蕴藏的珍宝提高认识，是有帮助的，所以我赞美《钱钟书研究》的出版。
