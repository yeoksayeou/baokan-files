	China's Grain Harvest Exceeds 400 Million Tons This Year, But Still Below 1984's Record High

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 17 (Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Chen Yongqing, Xinhua News Agency reporter Pu Liye) The Rural Social and Economic Survey Team of the National Bureau of Statistics reported that this year's national grain total production can reach over 400 million tons, making it the second year after 1984 to exceed 400 million tons.

	The relevant personnel of the Rural Social and Economic Survey Team of the National Bureau of Statistics said that looking at the national grain production situation this year, it can be summarized as: the summer grain in the northern region is better than in the southern region, and the autumn grain in the southern region is better than in the northern region. The total production of the summer and autumn seasons combined is higher than last year, but it still does not reach the historical highest level of 1984.

	Experts analyzed that if the autumn grain in the northern region, especially in the three northeastern provinces, had not been reduced due to disasters, China's grain production could have broken through the stagnant situation. This fact further reminds us that it is crucial to improve agricultural water conservancy infrastructure and enhance the ability to resist natural disasters in order to break through the stagnant situation of grain production over the past few years. In this sense, the current wave of agricultural water conservancy infrastructure construction sweeping across the country will create favorable conditions for achieving a bumper grain harvest next year.

    我国今年粮食丰收  总产量超过四亿吨
    仍未达到1984年的历史最高水平
    新华社北京11月17日电　（中央人民广播电台记者陈勇庆、新华社记者蒲立业）国家统计局农村社会经济调查总队提供的消息说，今年全国粮食总产量可达四亿多吨，成为继1984年后，第二个超过四亿吨的年头。
    国家统计局农调总队有关人士说，纵观今年全国粮食生产形势，可概括为夏粮北方地区好于南方地区、秋粮南方地区好于北方地区，夏秋两季统算比去年增产，但总产量仍达不到1984年的历史最高水平。
    有关专家分析认为，如果今年北方地区，特别是东北三省的秋粮不因灾减产，我国粮食生产是可能突破徘徊局面的。这一事实，进一步提醒我们搞好农田水利基本建设，提高抗御自然灾害能力，对突破连续几年粮食生产徘徊局面至关重要。就此意义上说，目前正在全国各地掀起的农田水利基本建设热潮，将为夺取明年粮食丰收创造有利条件。
