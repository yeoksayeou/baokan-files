The Sudden Change in the Situation in Lebanon

By Lǚ Zhīxīng, Our Special Correspondent

On November 22 of this year, Lebanon celebrated its 46th anniversary of independence. However, just after President René Moawad congratulated the country on its independence day, he was tragically assassinated. This president, who had been in office for only 17 days, had vowed to save the Lebanese nation, regardless of the obstacles and sacrifices. The sudden death of President Moawad deeply shocked the hearts of the Lebanese people, who have suffered so much.

In his condolence message, Lebanese Prime Minister Selim al-Hoss said, "The criminals can kill a great life, but they cannot destroy a nation's belief. The will for reconciliation in Lebanon will forever exist."

The death of Moawad has caused a dramatic change in the situation in Lebanon, which had just begun to walk the path of reconciliation. The future of Lebanon is once again at a crossroads between civil war and reconciliation.

Moawad was elected president by the Lebanese Parliament on November 5, in accordance with the steps stipulated in the "Lebanese National Reconciliation Document" adopted by the Taif Conference. In his inaugural speech, he said that he would fully adhere to all the provisions of the Taif Agreement and implement them. On November 13, he authorized former Prime Minister Selim al-Hoss to form a new government. Shortly after taking office, President Moawad had frequent contacts and consultations with various Lebanese political and sectarian leaders on the issue of forming a new Lebanese government. Previously, there were reports that the new Lebanese government would be announced in the coming days. However, Lebanese military leader Michel Aoun has always been opposed to the Taif Agreement. He accused the Lebanese parliamentarians who participated in the Taif Conference of damaging Lebanon's independence and sovereignty and violating the Lebanese Constitution. Before the parliamentary election of the president, Aoun announced the dissolution of the parliament and refused to recognize the election results. He also stated that Moawad's authorization of Selim al-Hoss to form a cabinet was illegal and invalid. He banned Christian parliamentarians from the East Beirut area from entering the cabinet, delaying the formation of the new Lebanese government. Because Aoun controls the presidential palace located in the East Beirut area, President Moawad was forced to work in the government building in the East area. Lebanon remains in a state of division.

The assassination of President Moawad has aroused great indignation in Arab countries. Syria, Jordan, and Gulf countries strongly condemned this criminal act. The United States, the Soviet Union, France, and other countries also issued statements and speeches opposing this terrorist activity. After the incident, the Syrian president immediately contacted the Saudi king, the Moroccan king, and the Algerian president by telephone, calling on the Arab League's three-party committee to take emergency measures and convene the Lebanese parliament as soon as possible to elect a new president to take over the work of the deceased president. The Arab League's three-party committee is now in contact with the United States, the Soviet Union, and other major countries to prevent a new civil war in Lebanon.

According to reports, this morning, Lebanese Muslim and Christian sects gathered troops at the border between East and West Beirut, and both sides are on high alert. Syria accused Aoun of being the murderer of President Moawad. Aoun, on the other hand, pointed out that Syria had planned to assassinate Moawad because Moawad did not agree to Syria's plan to solve the problem of East Beirut by force.

Local political figures believe that the situation in Lebanon has been brewing a crisis since the Taif Conference. Lebanon's problems are very complex, with various contradictions intertwined. After 14 years of internal strife, the accumulated grievances among various sects are difficult to resolve through a single agreement and a single conference. Due to the continued existence of armed forces among various sects, all kinds of solutions are threatened, and any unexpected event can occur. The assassination of President Moawad has made the already severe situation even more difficult. In the atmosphere of rampant assassinations, Lebanese parliamentarians are very concerned and anxious about their personal safety, making it difficult to convene parliamentary sessions to elect a new president in the near future, let alone the formation of a new government. On the other hand, the Israeli Defense Minister threatened that unless Syria withdraws its troops from Lebanon and Lebanon forms a new government, Israel will not withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon. It can be seen that the situation in Lebanon will still go through a difficult and complex period.

### 黎巴嫩局势的突变

　　黎巴嫩局势的突变
　　本报记者　吕志星
  今年11月22日正逢黎巴嫩独立46周年纪念日。当黎巴嫩第9任总统穆阿瓦德在向祖国的独立日致贺之后竟惨遭谋害。这位上任仅17天的总统曾立誓拯救黎巴嫩祖国，不管有多少障碍和多大牺牲。穆阿瓦德总统突遭不测，强烈震撼了黎巴嫩人民饱经忧患之心。
    黎巴嫩总理胡斯吊唁穆阿瓦德的文告中说，“罪犯可以杀死一个伟大的生命，但摧毁不了一个民族的信念，黎巴嫩和解的意志永存。”
    穆阿瓦德之死使刚刚踏上和解之路的黎巴嫩局势发生剧变，黎巴嫩的前途再次处在内战和和解的十字路口。
    穆阿瓦德是根据塔伊夫会议通过的“黎全国和解文件”所规定的步骤于本月5日在黎议会选举中当选为总统的。他在就职后发表讲话说，他将完全恪守塔伊夫协议的各项条款，并付诸实现。本月13日他授权前总理胡斯组阁。穆阿瓦德总统上任伊始，就同黎各政党、教派领导人就组建黎新政府问题进行了频繁的接触和磋商。先前曾有报道，近日内黎新政府将宣布成立。黎军政府领导人奥恩对塔伊夫协议一直持反对立场，他指责参加塔伊夫会议的黎议员损害了黎的独立和主权，违反了黎宪法。在黎议会选举总统前，奥恩宣布解散议会，并拒不承认选举结果。他还表示，穆阿瓦德总统授权胡斯组阁是非法和无效的。他禁止贝鲁特东区的基督教派议员入阁，使黎新政府迟迟不能组成。由于奥恩占据着地处贝鲁特东区的总统府，穆阿瓦德总统被迫在东区的政府大楼里办公。黎巴嫩仍处在分裂状态。
    穆阿瓦德总统遇害激起阿拉伯国家的极大愤慨，叙利亚、约旦和海湾国家强烈谴责这一罪恶行径。美国、苏联、法国等国纷纷发表声明和谈话，反对这一恐怖活动。事发后，叙利亚总统立即同沙特国王、摩洛哥国王和阿尔及利亚总统电话联系，呼吁阿盟三方委员会采取紧急措施，尽快召开黎议会会议，选举新总统接替已故总统的工作。阿盟三方委员会正同美、苏等大国联系，以避免黎爆发新的内战。
    据报道，今天早晨，黎巴嫩穆斯林教派和基督教派在贝鲁特东、西区交界线集结军队，双方处于高度戒备状态。叙利亚指控奥恩是谋杀穆阿瓦德总统的凶手。奥恩则指出，叙利亚预谋杀害穆阿瓦德是因为穆阿瓦德不同意叙利亚以武力解决贝鲁特东区的计划。
    当地政界人士认为，黎巴嫩局势自塔伊夫会议后，一直孕育着一场危机。黎巴嫩的问题十分复杂，各种矛盾盘根错节，经历14年的内乱各教派间的积怨很难通过一个协议和一次会议解决。由于各教派的武装力量的继续存在，对各种解决都构成一种威胁，任何意外事件都可能发生。穆阿瓦德总统的遇难使严峻的形势更加困难，在暗杀成风的恐怖气氛下，黎巴嫩议员们对自己的人身安全十分忧虑和不安，近期内难以召开议会会议选举新总统，更谈不上新政府的组成。另一方面，以色列国防部长扬言，除非叙利亚从黎巴嫩撤军以及黎巴嫩组成新政府，否则以色列不从黎巴嫩南部撤军。由此可见，黎巴嫩局势还要经历一个艰难和复杂的时期。
