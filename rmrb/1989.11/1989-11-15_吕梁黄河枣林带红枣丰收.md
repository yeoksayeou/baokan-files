The 300-kilometer-long and 60-kilometer-wide Yellow River date orchard belt in the Lu Liang region of Shanxi Province has achieved a bumper harvest this year. The total production reached 40 million kilograms, surpassing the historical highest annual production.

The Lu Liang region has long been one of the main production areas for red dates in China. In recent years, this region has built a 420,000-mu (28,000-hectare) Yellow River forest belt along the Yellow River in Xing County, Lin County, Liu Lin, and Shi Lou. A series of preferential policies for date tree production have been formulated, resulting in a large-scale bumper harvest of red dates. Processed products such as smoked dates, jade dates, crispy dates, honey dates, and wine dates have all entered the international market.
