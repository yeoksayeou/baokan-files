The third academic discussion meeting of the Chinese Education Association, which lasted for five days, concluded today in Tianjin. Over 90 experts, scholars, and outstanding teachers from all over the country attended the meeting.

This discussion focused on assessing the educational situation, identifying educational mistakes, their causes, and lessons learned, as well as discussing the guiding ideology of education. The meeting reflected on the experiences and mistakes in China's education over the past decade since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It proposed corresponding strategies and explored how to cultivate successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause who are idealistic, moral, cultured, and disciplined.

Regarding the educational situation over the past decade, the general consensus was that development has been rapid, achievements significant, but problems numerous, and challenges substantial. This decade has been one of recovery, adjustment, reform, exploration, and development, but it has also been a decade marked by various mistakes.

Regarding the issue of educational mistakes, some attendees believed that educational mistakes include both strategic and tactical errors. Neglecting the education of communist ideology and the Four Cardinal Principles among the younger generation was a strategic mistake. For a period, we emphasized the challenges of the new technological revolution but overlooked the more severe challenge of foreign hostile forces attempting to "peacefully evolve" our country.

Regarding the guiding ideology of education, attendees believed that in recent years, the main mistake in educational work has been in implementing the guiding principle that "education must serve socialist construction." In the question of whom education serves, there has been a tendency to focus solely on serving the needs of material civilization and commodity economy, neglecting the crucial role of education in building socialist spiritual civilization. In the question of cultivating what kind of person, there has been a tendency to emphasize professional skills while neglecting political standards. In the question of how to cultivate people, there has been a mistake of theory being detached from practice and education being disconnected from productive labor. These issues need to be thoroughly reflected upon and corrected.

Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhang Chengxian, and Vice Minister of the State Education Commission, Liu Bin, attended the meeting.

    教育界人士反思十年教育得失
　　发展很快　成绩很大　问题不少　困难很多
    新华社天津11月25日电　（记者朱玉泉）中国教育学会第三次学术讨论会历时5天，今天在天津闭幕。来自全国各地的90多位专家、学者和优秀教师出席会议。
    这次讨论会着重围绕对教育形势的估计，教育失误的表现、原因、经验教训以及教育的指导思想进行讨论，反思我国教育自党的十一届三中全会以来十年中所取得的经验和出现的失误，提出相应对策，并探讨如何培养有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的无产阶级革命事业接班人的问题。
    对十年来的教育形势，大家总的看法是，发展很快，成绩很大，但问题不少，困难很多；这十年既是恢复、调整、改革、探索、发展的十年，也是有这样或那样失误的十年。
    关于教育失误问题，一些同志认为，教育失误既有决策上的失误，也有认识和实际执行中的失误。其中忽视对青年一代共产主义思想和四项基本原则的教育则是战略性失误。在一段时期里，我们只提新技术革命的挑战，忽视了国外敌对势力企图对我们“和平演变”这个更严峻的挑战。
    关于教育指导思想问题，与会同志认为，近年来教育工作主要是在贯彻“教育必须为社会主义建设服务”的指导方针上出现了失误；在教育为谁服务问题上出现了只注重服务于物质文明建设和商品经济的需要，忽略了教育在建设社会主义精神文明中举足轻重的巨大作用的情况；在培养什么人的问题上，出现了单纯强调业务水准，忽视政治标准的倾向；在怎样培养人的问题上，犯了理论脱离实际，教育与生产劳动相脱节的错误。这些都需要在深刻反思的基础上加以认真改正。
    全国人大常委会教科文卫委员会副主任委员张承先、国家教委副主任柳斌出席了会议。
