The fish products of Zhoushan, Zhejiang, have always been considered the "Emperor's Daughter," never having trouble finding buyers. Every province and city in the country, including Taiwan, consumes Zhoushan fish. Processed fish products are also exported to over 50 countries and regions.

However, this year, the "Emperor's Daughter" has suddenly become an "ugly daughter-in-law," facing difficulties in sales. Tens of thousands of tons of high-quality, fresh fish such as large yellowtail, greenling, yellow croaker, and horse mackerel, as well as processed products like fish slices, fish fillets, and canned fish, are urgently seeking "matchmakers." Some have been "sleeping" in cold storage for half a year...

Why can't Zhoushan's fish "swim" anymore? Experts recently analyzed the main reasons as follows:

First, the overall purchasing power of society has declined. After the state tightened monetary policy, the "floating capital" of various enterprises and institutions has significantly decreased. The funds previously used by some enterprises for employee welfare and internal "small treasuries" have also notably reduced. Therefore, the phenomenon of large-scale purchases of fish products by some large and medium-sized enterprises using "public funds" has basically disappeared this year. In the past, they were major buyers.

Some state-owned and collective aquaculture trading companies, due to limited working capital, are reluctant to purchase large quantities of high-quality, high-priced fish. For example, there are still thousands of tons of large and extra-large yellowtail in five relatively large aquaculture cold storage facilities in Putuo District, Zhoushan City. Since May, many procurement personnel from Northeast China have come to inspect the fish, generally satisfied with the quality. However, upon hearing the price, they leave without a word. They are afraid to take the risk, fearing they might sell at a loss.

Second, some provinces have imported large quantities of aquatic products from abroad, hindering the "swimming" of Zhoushan fish. In the first half of this year, Northeast China and some large and medium-sized cities in the south imported tens of thousands of tons of cod and pollock from countries like the Soviet Union and North Korea through various channels. These imported fish are well-packaged, headless and tailless, and relatively cheap (the price of 2 kilograms of cod is less than that of 1 kilogram of large yellowtail), dominating the aquatic market. In comparison, the processing quality of Zhoushan fish has reached a point where it must be improved.

Third, changes in consumer tastes have impacted the sales market for processed aquatic products. Putuo District's Shengjiamen Town Mayor Yu Yaoguo and Shengjiamen Fishery Company Manager Zhang Jingkang discovered during their market surveys in cities like Shenyang and Dalian that Zhoushan's flagship product—delicious fish slices—is no longer as popular as it was a few years ago. In the past two years, new small snacks have emerged in markets like Northeast China, breaking the monopoly of delicious fish slices, and their prices are significantly lower than those of fish slices. The sales volume of these snacks has surged, inevitably causing delicious fish slices to become less popular. How to replace old products with new processed products is another important issue facing Zhoushan's aquaculture processing sector.

Fourth, over-concentration of sales channels has led to market saturation and consumer fatigue. Recently, many aquaculture cold storage facilities, in a desperate attempt to sell their inventory, have concentrated large quantities of horse mackerel, yellowtail, and their processed products in a few cities, seeking agents for sales. Due to this concentration, the sales situation is not ideal, and some goods have deteriorated over time, making consumers even less willing to buy.

How can Zhoushan's fish become popular again? Some insightful individuals believe: In the future, aquaculture production should focus on protecting existing aquatic resources while improving on-board preservation to ensure that fishing, transportation, processing, and sales are all conducted within the "cold chain," with each link tightly connected, to maintain the freshness of the fish and shorten the time between ocean fishing and reaching the consumer's table. In the current situation of insufficient procurement funds and temporary difficulties in selling fish, the aquaculture sector can collaborate with some large and medium-sized enterprises and aquaculture trading departments that have strong capabilities and good credit, implementing methods such as "production supply, installment payments, guaranteed sales, profit sharing, and shared risks" to accelerate the "swimming" of Zhoushan fish. Additionally, the aquaculture processing sector must seriously study the market, develop new products based on changing consumer tastes, explore new markets, improve operating methods and packaging specifications to convenience consumers; and adhere to the principles of quality-based pricing and thin-profit, high-volume sales to win customer trust. It can be believed that as long as the production and operating sectors make practical efforts, Zhoushan fish will definitely overcome the difficulties.

### “皇帝女儿”也“愁嫁”——为什么舟山鱼“游”不动？

    “皇帝女儿”也“愁嫁”
    ——为什么舟山鱼“游”不动？
    徐博龙
    浙江舟山市的鱼货，一直被视为“皇帝的女儿”，从来不愁销路。全国各省市，包括台湾，都吃舟山的鱼。经加工的鱼系列产品还出口，销往50多个国家和地区。
    可是今年以来，“皇帝女儿”一下变成了“丑媳妇”，销售竟困难起来。上万吨规格大、鲜度好的带鱼、青、黄鲇鱼、马面鱼，以及加工好的美味鱼片、鱼排、鱼罐头等急着找“红娘”。有的已在冷库里“沉睡”了大半年……
    为什么舟山鱼“游”不动了呢？行家们最近分析认为，主要有4条原因：
    一、当前社会总体购买力有所下降。国家银根抽紧后，各企事业单位的“游资”大幅度减少，一些企业原来用于职工福利的资金及内部“小金库”资金也明显减少。因此，各地一些大中型企业用“公费”大批量购买鱼货的现象今年基本消失。而往年，他们都是大买主。
    一些国营、集体水产经销公司也由于周转资金有限，不愿大批量购进优质高价鱼货。例如舟山市普陀区5家规模较大的水产冷库里目前还有上千吨大带鱼、特大带鱼，5月份以来，不少东北地区的采购员上门看鱼货，一般对质量都十分满意，可是一问价格，便不吭声地走了。他们怕担风险，卖不动还要赔本。
    二、一些省从国外大量进口水产品，阻碍了舟山鱼的“游”动。今年上半年，我国东北三省及南方的一些大中城市，通过各种渠道先后从苏联、朝鲜等国家进口了十几万吨鳕鱼、明太鱼。这些进口鱼包装整齐、去头去尾，价格也较低（2公斤鳕鱼价不足1公斤大带鱼价），在水产市场上占了上风。相比之下，舟山鱼的加工质量是到了非改不可的地步了。
    三、人们的口味变化，冲击了水产品加工品销售市场。普陀区沈家门镇镇长虞亚国和沈家门渔业公司经理张经康在沈阳、大连等市场考察后发现，舟山的“拳头”产品——美味鱼片已经不像前几年那样“抢手”了。近两年，东北等地市场出现了一批新的小食品，打破了美味鱼片的“一统天下”，而它们的价格又明显低于鱼片。这些食品销量猛增，美味鱼片必然由俏变滞。怎样用新的加工品代替老品种，是摆在舟山水产加工部门面前的又一重要课题。
    四、销路过于集中，使部分市场超饱和，群众厌购。前一段，不少水产冷库病急乱投医，把库存的马面鱼、带鱼及其加工品过于集中地运往少数城市，求人代销。由于过于集中，销售状况很不理想，有不少货时久变质，消费者更不愿买。
    怎样才能使舟山鱼重新畅销起来呢？一些有识之士认为：今后的渔业生产要在保护现有的水产资源前提下，抓好海上第一线保鲜，使水产品的捕捞、运输、加工、销售等都在“冷链”中进行，环环紧扣，以保证鱼货鲜度，尽量缩短海洋捕捞与居民上餐桌之间的时间。在当前收购资金不足，鱼货一时难销的情况下，水产部门可以与一些实力强、信誉好的大中型企业及水产经销部门，实行“生产供给，分期付款，担保代销，利润分成，风险共担”的方法，以加快舟山鱼的“游”动。此外，水产加工部门必须认真研究市场，根据人们口味的变化开发新产品，开拓新市场，改进经营方式、包装规格，以方便消费者；还要坚持按质论价、薄利多销的原则，以赢得用户信任。可以相信，只要生产、经营部门做切实的努力，舟山鱼定能走出困境。
