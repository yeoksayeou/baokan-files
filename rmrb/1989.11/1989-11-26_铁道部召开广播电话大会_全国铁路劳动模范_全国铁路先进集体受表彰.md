The Ministry of Railways held a broadcast telephone conference in Beijing and 144 sub-venues across the country to honor 373 "National Railway Labor Models" and 78 "National Railway Advanced Collectives." Minister of Railways Li Senmao said at the conference that the revitalization of China's railways relies on the leading role of these model figures and the collective efforts of the 3.2 million railway workers.

The labor models and advanced collectives honored today are mostly from the grassroots level. Among them are workers who have been toiling on the front lines of transportation production for years, pioneers who bravely traverse mountains and rivers despite scorching heat and bitter cold, scientific and technological workers who are dedicated to research and innovation to help China's railways catch up with the world's advanced levels, railway public security officers who fearlessly protect railway transportation safety and passengers' lives and property, and party and government officials who serve the people with integrity and dedication.

Li Senmao called on all railway workers to uphold the spirit of being masters of their own work, to work hard, and to adhere to the principle of "Railways for the People" to contribute to the future development of the railways.

　　铁道部召开广播电话大会
　　全国铁路劳动模范　全国铁路先进集体受表彰
    新华社北京11月25日电　（记者李玫）铁道部今天在北京和全国144个分会场召开广播电话大会，表彰373名“全国铁路劳动模范”和78个“全国铁路先进集体”。铁道部长李森茂在会上说，中国铁路的振兴靠的就是这些模范人物的骨干带头作用和全体320万铁路职工的共同奋斗。
    今天受表彰的劳动模范和先进集体大多直接来自基层。他们中有长年累月奋战在运输生产第一线的工人，有不畏酷暑严寒、踏遍千山万水的开路先锋，有为中国铁路赶超世界先进水平刻苦钻研创新的科技工作者，有为保卫铁路运输安全和旅客生命财产临危不惧的铁路公安干警，也有廉洁从政，悉心为群众办事的党政干部。
    李森茂要求全路职工发扬主人翁精神，艰苦奋斗，本着“人民铁路为人民”的宗旨，为铁路未来的大发展作出贡献。
