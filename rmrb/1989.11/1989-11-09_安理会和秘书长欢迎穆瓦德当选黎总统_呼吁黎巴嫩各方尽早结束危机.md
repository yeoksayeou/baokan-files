The Security Council and the Secretary-General Welcome Muwahhid's Election as Lebanese President
Urge Lebanese Parties to End the Crisis as Soon as Possible

United Nations, November 7 (Reported by Liu Kai Chen) The United Nations Security Council today welcomed the recent election of Lebanon's new president, Rene Muwahhid, by the Lebanese parliament, and approved the Taif Agreement for resolving the Lebanese crisis, considering it an important step towards restoring peace in Lebanon.

The Security Council held a consultation meeting today to discuss the current situation in Lebanon. After the meeting, the Security Council's chairman for this month, Li Lu Ye, issued the above statement.

The Security Council called on all Lebanese people to resolutely stand by the new president and unite to achieve their common aspirations for peace, dignity, and harmony.

The Security Council also called on all sectors of Lebanese society, including the armed forces, to support the new president to achieve the common goal of the Lebanese people: restoring unity, independence, and sovereignty over all Lebanese territory, so that Lebanon can regain its civilization and culture in the Arab nation and the world.

Lebanese factions have differing opinions, and the civil war has lasted 14 years. Since last September, the country has been without a president.

United Nations, November 6 (Reported by Liu Kai Chen) United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar issued a statement today welcoming the election of Lebanon's new president, Rene Muwahhid, by the Lebanese parliament yesterday, stating that this is an "important step in the process of re-establishing the legitimate institutions of the Lebanese state."

De Cuellar expressed his hope that the Lebanese people can restore peace and normal life and called on all parties concerned to work together to achieve this goal.

Since September 1988, Lebanon has been without a president. At that time, the term of Lebanese President Amin Gemayel had expired, and due to the Lebanese civil war and differing opinions among the factions, the parliament was unable to elect a new president.
