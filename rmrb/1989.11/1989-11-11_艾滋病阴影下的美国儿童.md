The beautiful and intelligent young girl, Sylvester Carion, died recently at the age of 12 years and 7 months at the Einstein Medical College in New York due to congenital AIDS. Two teddy bears she loved in her lifetime accompanied her to her final resting place.

Carion was born in the Bronx area of New York. Her father started using drugs at the age of 12, and not only contracted AIDS himself but also infected his wife and children. Carion's mother and father died in 1983 and 1988 respectively, and her younger brother also succumbed to AIDS. Now, only her two surviving sisters and grandmother are left to support each other.

The unfortunate Carion had to fight against the AIDS grim reaper since birth. She often accompanied her grandmother to the hospital, enduring immense pain on the sickbed. In 1987, Carion gained national attention as the longest-surviving congenital AIDS child in the United States at that time. Her portrait was featured on the cover of Newsweek, and she was taken to the White House by Mrs. Reagan, the wife of President Reagan. As she realized she was about to leave the world, she quietly told those around her that perhaps it was time to see her mother.

Compared to other children with congenital AIDS, Carion was relatively fortunate because most young patients can only live for a few years or even a few months, and their brains or motor functions are often damaged.

According to the Atlanta Center for Disease Control, there are currently 1,859 recorded cases of children under 13 with congenital AIDS in the United States, mainly concentrated in the three major cities of New York, Newark, and Miami. However, these cases only include those with obvious symptoms. If all children infected with the AIDS virus are included, it is estimated that there are thousands in New York City alone. A renowned AIDS expert predicts that with the increasing number of adult AIDS patients in recent years, by 1991, 15,000 to 20,000 American children will show symptoms.

AIDS not only robs children of their joy and devours their young lives but also imposes a heavy economic burden on families and society. It is reported that due to the high cost of the only effective drug for AIDS, AZT, plus the expenses for experiments, care, and hospitalization, the medical costs over several years can reach tens of thousands of dollars.

    艾滋病阴影下的美国儿童
    本报记者　仓立德
    美丽、聪颖的小姑娘西来斯特·卡丽昂，因患先天性艾滋病，不久前在纽约爱因斯坦医学院死去，年仅12岁零7个月。两只她生前喜爱的玩具熊陪伴她长眠地下。
    卡丽昂出生于纽约布朗克斯区，她的父亲自12岁起就开始吸毒，此后不但自己沾染上艾滋病，而且殃及妻子和子女。卡丽昂的母亲和父亲于1983年、1988年先后病故，她的弟弟后来也死于艾滋病，现在全家只有她幸存的两个姐姐和外祖母相依为命。
    不幸的卡丽昂从降生起就不得不同艾滋病死神搏斗。她常常随外祖母出入医院大门，在病床上忍受巨大的痛苦。1987年，卡丽昂以其是当时美国存活时间最长的先天性艾滋病儿童而受到举国关注。她的肖像出现在《新闻周刊》的封面上，里根总统的夫人领她参观了白宫。在意识到将辞别人世时，她悄悄对身旁的人说，也许现在是见她母亲的时候了。
    比起其他患先天性艾滋病的儿童，卡丽昂还算是幸运的，因为绝大多数小患者至多只能活数年甚至几个月，而且大脑或运动机能受到损伤。
    据亚特兰大疾病控制中心统计，目前全美记录在案的13岁以下先天性艾滋病患者已达1859名，主要集中在纽约、纽瓦克、迈阿密3大城市。但这些案例只限于具有明显症状者，如包括所有受艾滋病毒感染的儿童，仅纽约市据估计便有数千名。一位著名艾滋病专家预测，随着近年成年男女艾滋病患者不断增多，到1991年将有1.5万—2万美国儿童显露症状。
    艾滋病不仅剥夺儿童患者的欢乐，吞噬他们的幼小生命，而且给家庭和社会造成沉重的经济负担。据报道，由于目前艾滋病的唯一特效药AZT价格昂贵，加上实验、护理、住院等，数年医疗费便可高达几十万美元。（本报华盛顿电）
