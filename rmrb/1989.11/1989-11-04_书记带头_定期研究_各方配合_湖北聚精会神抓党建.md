Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 3rd - Reporter Gōng Dáfā reports: After the turmoil, various levels of party organizations in Hubei Province deeply feel the extreme importance of strengthening party building. Currently, the entire province is forming a trend of focusing intently on party building work.

In mid-October, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee held its first party building work conference in 40 years. The provincial party committee's standing committee members and municipal and prefectural party secretaries spent five or six days studying party building work. The provincial party committee decided that the first step in strengthening party building is to start with the provincial party committee's standing committee members, with the secretary leading the way and establishing a system: every plenary session of the provincial party committee must seriously study party building; at least one meeting of municipal and prefectural party secretaries must be held each year to specifically study and deploy party building work across the province; the provincial party committee's standing committee members must regularly listen to reports from the party building department, study and analyze party building situations, and check on implementation. At this meeting, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee also established a rule: not only should the provincial party leaders in charge of party building focus intently on party building work, but every member of the provincial party committee's standing committee and committee members must regard strengthening party building as their responsibility. The provincial party committee also requires that party members holding leadership positions in the People's Congress, government, political consultative conferences, and mass organizations must strengthen their party consciousness and improve their awareness of strengthening party building.

Secretaries leading the way to strengthen party building, with all sides coordinating and cooperating, is an important feature of Hubei's party building work. Provincial Party Secretary Guān Guǎngfù and the leaders in charge of party building work go out to conduct investigations and inspections, always regarding party building as an important content. Every time they visit a place, they inquire about party building. They also take the lead in lecturing at the party school and leading the study of party building theory. Recently, Guān Guǎngfù, in conjunction with implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, studied some theoretical and practical issues of party building with everyone and personally wrote a research outline that has both theory and practice.

It is understood that Hubei Province already has a group of municipal and county party secretaries who study party building theory and research party affairs work, becoming experts and professionals in party affairs work. The party secretary of Xiāntáo City conducts in-depth investigations of party building work in the grassroots every year, writing investigative reports and papers that have guiding significance for the city's party building work. Under his leadership, the 11 members of the municipal party committee each have a party building work contact point, and the standing committee members regularly go to their contact points to observe party days, improving work style and strengthening party building. Yíchéng County has insisted for several years on the "four-link responsibility system" where county party committee members are linked to grassroots party committees, grassroots party committee members are linked to party branches, branch members are linked to party small groups, and party members are linked to the masses, changing the past situation where a few party committee members used part of their energy to strengthen party building. Now, all levels of party committee members take responsibility for party building work, and everyone is concerned, making "the party must manage the party" truly fall into place.

    书记带头　定期研究　各方配合
    湖北聚精会神抓党建
    本报武汉11月3日电　记者龚达发报道：经过动乱考验，湖北省各级党组织深感抓党的建设的极端重要性，目前，全省正在形成聚精会神抓党建工作的风气。
    10月上中旬，湖北省委召开了40年来第一次党建工作会议。省委常委和地市州委书记集中五六天时间，认真研究党建工作。省委作出决定，抓党建首先从省委常委做起，书记带头，形成制度：每次省委全会都要认真研究党的建设；每年至少召开一次地市州委书记会议，专题研究部署全省党建工作；省委常委要经常听取党建部门的汇报，研究分析党建情况，检查落实。在这次会上，湖北省委还定出一个规矩：不仅分管党建的省委领导成员要聚精会神抓好党建工作，省委每个常委、委员都要把抓党建作为自己的职责。省委还要求各级党委成员，尤其是县以上党委书记要用更多的精力和时间抓党建。在人大、政府、政协和群众团体中担任领导职务的共产党员，要增强党的观念，提高抓党建的自觉性。
    书记带头抓党建，各方面协同配合是湖北省党建工作的重要特色。省委书记关广富和分管党建工作的领导外出调查研究、检查工作，都把党建作为重要内容，每到一地都要了解党的建设。他们还带头到党校讲课，带头研究党建理论。不久前，关广富结合贯彻十三届四中全会精神，就党建的一些理论与实践问题同大家研究，并自己动手写出有理论有实践的研究提纲。
    据了解，湖北省已有一批地市县委书记钻研党建理论、研究党务工作，成为党务工作的专家、内行。仙桃市委书记每年深入基层专题调查党建工作二至三次，每次都写出对全市党建工作有指导意义的调查报告和论文。在他的带领下，市委11名常委人人都有党建工作的联系点，常委们定期到联系点过党日，既改进了工作作风，又加强了党的建设。宜城县连续几年坚持县委成员联系基层党委，基层党委成员联系党支部，支部成员联系党小组，党员联系群众的“四联责任制”，改变了以往少数党委成员用部分精力抓党建的状况。现在各级党委成员对党的建设工作，人人有责，人人操心，使“党要管党”真正落到实处。
