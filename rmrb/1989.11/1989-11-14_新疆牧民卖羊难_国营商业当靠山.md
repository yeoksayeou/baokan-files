Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, November 13th — “Even if we incur losses, we must help the herdsmen solve their problems.” The state-owned food departments in Xinjiang are helping herdsmen address the difficulty of selling sheep, and the herdsmen say, “State-owned businesses are our backbone.”

This year, Xinjiang’s livestock industry has seen its 12th consecutive year of bumper harvests. The total number of livestock in the region has increased by 1.7 million head compared to last year. However, due to drought and rodent infestations, the amount of grass in winter pastures has significantly decreased, making it difficult for livestock to survive the winter. To reduce livestock mortality during the winter, the region plans to increase the number of livestock sent to market by 1 million head compared to last year.

This year, the livestock market in Xinjiang has seen an unusual trend: sheep meat prices have continued to drop, and the fur market has also declined. Since autumn, the number of individual buyers in pastoral areas has significantly decreased, leading to a surplus in state-owned food departments and the emergence of the “difficulty in selling sheep” problem. The herdsmen are anxious.

To avoid “too many livestock causing harm to herdsmen,” the autonomous region government has stipulated that the purchase price for live sheep will not be reduced. Facing the herdsmen’s difficulties, the state-owned food departments in Xinjiang have taken on the task of increasing the purchase of 2,000 tons of sheep meat. The Urumqi Food Company has taken on the task of purchasing and selling 900 tons of local sheep meat, making it the unit with the largest increase in purchases.

    新疆牧民卖羊难  国营商业当靠山
    新华社乌鲁木齐11月13日电　（记者杨生蒲）“宁愿自己亏本，也要帮助牧民排忧解难。”新疆国营食品部门帮助牧民解决“卖羊难”，牧民们感动地说：“国营商业是靠山”。
    今年，新疆畜牧业连续第12年丰收。全区牲畜比去年净增170万头。但干旱、鼠害等原因，使冬季牧场的产草量大幅度减少，给牲畜过冬造成困难。为减少牲畜越冬死亡，全区出栏牲畜将比去年多100万头。
    今年新疆畜牧市场一反常态，羊肉价格一降再降，皮毛行情下跌。秋冬以来，到牧区购买羊只羊肉的个体户大为减少，国营食品部门涨库严重，出现了“卖羊难”。牧民们心急如焚。
    为不致于“畜多伤牧”，自治区政府规定，活羊收购价格不降。面对牧民的困难，新疆国营食品部门承担起了增加收购羊肉2000吨的任务。乌鲁木齐市食品公司承担起购销当地羊肉900吨的任务，是承担增购任务最多的单位。
