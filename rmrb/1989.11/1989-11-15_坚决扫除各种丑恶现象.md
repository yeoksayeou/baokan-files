Shandong Province, while vigorously cracking down on "yellow" (pornographic) materials, has concentrated its forces and time to combat various ugly social phenomena. This has played a positive role in further stabilizing social order and developing a stable and united political atmosphere.

Currently, the entire Party and the people of the whole country are earnestly implementing the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. The tasks before us are both glorious and arduous. To accomplish these tasks, we must maintain long-term social stability. Stability is the highest interest of the people of the whole country and the overriding priority. Without stability, there can be no development. Various ugly social phenomena, including yellow pollution, are all factors that destabilize society. Therefore, while resolutely implementing the policies of rectification and deepening reform, we must make a firm decision to expand the achievements of the "anti-yellow" campaign and resolutely eliminate various ugly social phenomena.

In recent years, although some regions and departments have done some work in combating various ugly social phenomena, due to the spread of bourgeois liberalization and various erroneous views on life and values, people's minds have been greatly corrupted, and social customs have been poisoned. Some phenomena that had already been eradicated, such as prostitution, trafficking of women and children, drug trafficking, gambling, and the use of feudal superstitions to cheat and harm people, as well as criminal activities involving gangs with black society characteristics, have resurfaced. In some places, because ugly social phenomena are not effectively stopped, social and public security problems have become increasingly prominent, causing harm to many people, especially young people who are inexperienced in the world. The increase in juvenile crime in some regions and the rising crime rate among students are also the result of these ugly social phenomena not being effectively stopped in time. Therefore, it is necessary to resolutely eliminate various ugly social phenomena to meet the needs of the situation and to follow the will of the people, which will certainly gain the support and approval of the broad masses.

Some regions have seen the emergence of certain social phenomena that violate national laws, which is related to the relaxation of Party leadership in recent years, neglect of the construction of grassroots governments and public security organizations, neglect of socialist moral and legal education, and the weakening of ideological and political work. Some Party members and cadres do not stop or fight against illegal and criminal activities such as trafficking of women and children, and some even participate in and support them. Therefore, it is necessary, as in Shandong Province, to include the elimination of social ugly phenomena as an important part of the evaluation of cadres' work. The responsibility of communists is to fight against all ugly phenomena and ultimately to eliminate all ugly phenomena from the earth. This historical responsibility of communists, now and in the future, cannot be canceled or relaxed. In recent years, due to the influence of bourgeois liberalization, some communists' fighting spirit has declined, and they are not even willing to criticize or resist social ugly phenomena. Some are not even willing to fight against bad people and bad things. This is exactly what those who attempt to subvert and sabotage us hope for, and it is the vile means by which those with ulterior motives corrupt the Party, corrupt cadres, and corrupt the socialist system. Our comrades must not be too naive.

Eliminating social ugly phenomena is a complex and arduous task that requires a firm stance, a clear attitude, effective measures, and sustained efforts. Under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, relevant departments should closely cooperate and work together to organically combine the "anti-yellow" campaign with the elimination of various ugly phenomena, and persistently do a good job in building socialist spiritual civilization.

    坚决扫除各种丑恶现象
    本报评论员
    山东省在狠抓“扫黄”的同时，集中力量、集中时间打击各种丑恶社会现象，对于进一步稳定社会秩序，发展安定团结政治局面起了积极作用。
    当前，全党和全国人民正在认真贯彻党的十三届五中全会精神。摆在我们面前的任务是光荣而艰巨的。为了完成这些任务，必须保持社会的长期稳定。稳定是全国人民的最高利益，是压倒一切的大局。没有稳定就没有发展。而包括黄色污染在内的各种社会丑恶现象都是社会的不稳定的因素，因此，在更加坚定地贯彻治理整顿和深化改革的方针的同时，必须下决心，扩大“扫黄”成果，坚决扫除各种社会丑恶现象。
    这几年，一些地区和部门虽然在打击各种社会丑恶现象方面做了些工作，但是，由于资产阶级自由化思潮和各种错误的人生观、价值观日益泛滥，极大地腐蚀了人们的思想，毒化了社会风气，一些本来已经绝迹的卖淫嫖娼，拐卖妇女儿童、贩运毒品、聚众赌博，以及利用封建迷信骗财害人和带黑社会性质的帮派组织等社会丑恶现象和犯罪活动又死灰复燃，有的愈演愈烈。有的地方因为社会丑恶现象屡禁不止，社会问题和治安问题也越来越突出，致使一些人特别是那些涉世不深的青少年深受其害。一些地区青少年犯罪增多，在校学生的犯罪率上升，也正是社会丑恶现象没有得到及时而有效制止的结果。因此，下决心扫除各种社会丑恶现象是形势的需要，是顺乎民意的，必然会得到广大群众的支持和拥护。
    一些地区所以出现某些违背国家法律的社会丑恶现象，与这些年来放松党的领导，忽视基层政权和治保组织的建设，忽视社会主义道德和法制教育，淡化思想政治工作有关，与党风不正、干部不负责任也有关。有的党员、干部对拐卖妇女儿童等违法犯罪活动不制止、不斗争，甚至参与、支持。因此，像山东省那样，把扫除社会丑恶现象列入对干部工作进行考评的重要内容是必要的。共产党人的职责就是同一切丑恶现象作斗争，并最终把一切丑恶现象从地球上消灭干净。共产党人的这一历史责任，现在以至将来，都不能取消或放松。前些年，由于资产阶级自由化思潮的影响，某些共产党员的斗争意志衰退，连对社会丑恶现象也不敢进行批评、抵制了，有的对坏人坏事也不敢进行斗争了，这正是企图对我们搞颠覆破坏的人所希望的，正是那些心怀叵测的人腐蚀党、腐蚀干部、腐蚀社会主义制度的险恶手段，我们的同志切不可太天真了。
    扫除社会丑恶现象是一项艰巨复杂的工作，需要坚定的立场、鲜明的态度、得力的措施、持久的努力。在党委的统一领导下，各有关部门要密切配合，协同作战，把“扫黄”同扫除各种丑恶现象有机地结合起来，坚持不懈地抓好社会主义精神文明建设。
