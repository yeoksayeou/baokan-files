	“Chinese Youth Have Great Aspirations”
		– A Record of Young Calligrapher Tian Boping

	Zhang Xu

	September in Beijing is refreshing and pleasant. A young visitor came to the Asian Games Village, bringing with him 35 calligraphy works he had painstakingly created over the past year to donate to the Asian Games Organizing Committee. He is the young calligrapher Tian Boping, who has recently emerged as a rising star. Master Qi Gong highly praised his action and specially wrote the inscription “Chinese Youth Have Great Aspirations.”

	Boping was born in 1957 by the banks of Baiyangdian Lake in Hebei. Under the influence of his maternal grandfather, the renowned Hebei calligrapher and educator Tian Puting, he began practicing calligraphy at the age of six. By the time he reached the age of thirty, he had developed a unique style in his calligraphy creations.

	“Learn calligraphy, first be a person,” Boping has taken this as his motto for more than twenty years. To prepare for the donation to the Asian Games, he has been particularly diligent over the past year. As a reporter and art editor for a newspaper, his work is very busy, and he also has family responsibilities. Therefore, he uses every late night to study and create. At the “donation ceremony,” he humorously told others: “Others live seven days a week, but I live nine days, because I have to add the all-nighters on Wednesdays and Fridays.” He expressed that his donation of the works is not for fame or profit, but to express his wish to “let the light of the Asian Games burn more brightly with a patriotic heart.”

	Boping’s calligraphy is characterized by its scholarly elegance and ethereal grace. Since 1982, his works have won numerous awards in domestic and international exhibitions. He pays great attention to the study of calligraphy theory and is currently writing the book “The Lines and Spatial Division of Calligraphy.” He is also passionate about calligraphy teaching and often holds calligraphy lectures at places like the Beijing Workers’ Cultural Palace.

	Boping is not only dedicated to calligraphy but also pays attention to extracurricular pursuits. In addition to being a member of the Beijing branch of the Chinese Calligraphers Association and the Chinese Hard-Pen Calligraphy Research Association, he is also a member of the Chinese Poetry and Word Association and the Chinese Industrial Art Design Association. In his spare time, he enjoys writing poetry to express his feelings, which is another of his extracurricular talents.

    “中华儿女多奇志”
    ——记青年书法家田伯平
    张旭
    9月的北京，爽气宜人。亚运村里来了一位年轻的客人，他把自己一年来精心创作的35幅书法作品捐献给了亚运会组委会。他就是近年来崭露头角的青年书法家田伯平。启功先生对他的这一行为十分赞赏，特意写了“中华儿女多奇志”的题词。
    伯平1957年生于河北白洋淀畔，受外祖父、河北省有名的书法家和教育家田普亭先生的影响，从6岁起即开科运笔，终于在而立之年形成了书法创作的独特风格。
    “学书先做人”，二十几年来，伯平把它当成座右铭来约束自己。为了准备向亚运会捐献的作品，近一年的时间中他特别勤奋。他是一家报纸的记者兼美编，工作很忙，又有家事拖累，所以，他都是利用每天深夜研习和创作的，他在
  “捐献仪式”上风趣地对人说：别人一个星期过7天，我过9天，因为得加上每周三和周五的通宵。他表示，捐献作品不是为了图名利，而是要表示自己“用一颗爱国之心让亚运之光燃烧得更加灿烂”的愿望。
    伯平书法以儒雅飘逸为特色。自1982年以来，他的作品多次在国内外展览中获奖。他很注意研究书法理论，正埋首编写《书法的线条及划分空间》一书。他还热心于书法教学，经常在北京劳动人民文化宫等地举办书法讲座。
    伯平不仅孜孜于书道，而且注意书外之功。他除了是中国书法家协会北京分会和中国硬笔书法研究会的会员外，还是中华诗词协会会员、中国工艺美术设计协会会员。闲来无事，赋诗抒怀，更是这位青年人的书外之长。
