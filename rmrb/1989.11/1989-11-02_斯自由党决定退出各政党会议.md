The Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the strongest force within the opposition, unanimously passed a resolution at its executive committee meeting on October 28 to withdraw from the multi-party conference in Sri Lanka.

The resolution stated that this move aims to unite other opposition parties to launch an offensive against the government, to end the current phase of killings and violence, and to control the soaring prices.

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party, led by Mrs. Bandaranaike, criticized the United National Party government for not implementing the proposal by five opposition parties to form an interim government to resolve the current domestic conflicts.
