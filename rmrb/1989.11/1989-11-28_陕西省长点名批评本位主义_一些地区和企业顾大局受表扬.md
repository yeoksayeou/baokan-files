At the Shaanxi Provincial Committee's work meeting, which concluded on November 25, Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Committee and Governor Hou Zongbin publicly criticized the Xianyang City Electrical Appliance Wholesale Company for its localism and refusal to execute national decisions. At the same time, he praised the Hanzhong Region and 11 large and medium-sized enterprises for considering the bigger picture and sharing the nation's burdens.

This autumn, in response to the sluggish home appliance market, excessive inventory of color televisions, and the difficulties faced by factories, the state decided to allocate special loans and provide interest subsidies. The plan was to purchase 76,000 color televisions from Shaanxi's commercial departments. The provincial government assigned the task to the commercial departments of Xi'an and Xianyang. The Xi'an commercial department overcame difficulties and purchased 38,000 units as planned, while the Xianyang City Electrical Appliance Wholesale Company refused to purchase any, causing the purchase plan to be delayed for over two months and preventing the commercial "reservoir" function from being realized.

The Hanzhong Region, considering the nation's difficulties, voluntarily proposed to forgo the 17 million yuan subsidy allocated by the province starting next year. Shaanxi Changling Machinery Factory, Shaanxi Broadcasting and Television Equipment Factory, Baoji Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory, Xingping Fertilizer Factory, and Shaanxi Cotton Mills 1, 4, 5, and 7 also considered the national and provincial difficulties. Despite maintaining the same contracted base and completing the contracted turnover tasks, they increased the turnover funds by 33.8 million yuan. Hou Zongbin said, "This spirit is truly valuable."

　　陕西省长点名批评本位主义
　　一些地区和企业顾大局受表扬
    本报西安11月27日电　记者孟西安报道：在11月25日结束的陕西省委工作会议上，省委副书记、省长侯宗宾当众点名批评了咸阳市交电批发公司搞本位主义、拒不执行国家决策的错误，同时表扬了汉中地区和11家大中型企业顾全大局、为国分忧的行动。
    今年秋季，国家针对家电产品市场疲软、彩电库存积压、工厂难以为继的状况，决定拨出专项贷款，并给予利息补贴，向陕西商业部门下达收购7.6万台彩电的计划。省政府确定由西安、咸阳两市商业部门分担任务。西安市商业部门克服困难，按计划收购了3.8万台，而咸阳市交电批发公司拒不收购，致使收购计划2个多月不能执行，商业“蓄水池”作用不能发挥。
    汉中地区为国分忧，主动提出从明年起不要省拨的1700万元定额补贴。陕西长岭机器厂、陕西广播电视设备厂、宝鸡氮肥厂、兴平化肥厂和陕棉一、四、五、七厂等11家大中型企业，也考虑到国家和省里的困难，在承包基数不变、完成承包上交任务的情况下，增加上交资金3380万元。侯宗宾说“这种精神难能可贵”。
