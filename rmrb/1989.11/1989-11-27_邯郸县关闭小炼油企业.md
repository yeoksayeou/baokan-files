In recent days, Handan County in Hebei Province has mobilized personnel to investigate and shut down small-scale, backyard oil refineries.

Over the past few years, despite repeated warnings from relevant departments, some individuals in Handan County have continued to operate these small refineries clandestinely. As a result, more than 400 such refineries have sprung up. Due to their crude methods and poor equipment, these refineries discharge large amounts of pollutants that harm the fields. In response, the county government issued a notice titled "On the Immediate Closure of Illegal Small Oil Refineries," widely publicizing the dangers of illegal oil refining and taking decisive measures to address the issue.

　　邯郸县关闭小炼油企业
    本报讯　连日来，河北省邯郸县集中人力清查土法小炼油企业，责令其立即关闭。
    近几年来，邯郸县一些人不顾有关部门的三令五申，明关暗开，迄今发展小炼油厂400多家。由于土法上马、设备简陋，每年要排出大量污染物侵蚀良田。为此，县政府下发了《关于立即撤销非法小炼油摊点的通知》，广泛宣传非法小炼油的危害性，并采取了果断措施。（赵维昌）
