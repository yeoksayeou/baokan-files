Most people who travel to Italy will not miss the opportunity to visit Venice. This famous water city, with a history of 1200 years, was designated in October of this year by the World Expo Committee as a candidate site for the 2000 World Expo. The other two candidate cities are Toronto in Canada and Hannover in the Federal Republic of Germany.

Strangely, the news did not bring joy to the citizens of Venice and many people in other parts of Italy; instead, it filled them with worry.

Venice is located at the northern end of the Adriatic Sea in northern Italy, in a low-lying area. In 1966, it suffered a severe flood due to seawater backflow, resulting in significant damage to historical artifacts. Experts have calculated that since the beginning of the 20th century, Venice has sunk by 9 inches. Citizens are often concerned about the threat of flooding. The municipal authorities say that before 1920, the Saint Mark's Square in the city had an average of 7 instances of water accumulation per year, but in recent years, this has increased to 45 times a year. Moreover, with the rising surface temperature, the inevitable rise in sea levels makes the tragedy of Venice being completely submerged a real possibility at any time.

A member of the Venice City Government said that during the peak tourist season, approximately 80,000 tourists visit daily, equivalent to the entire population of Venice. This not only exceeds the city's reception capacity but also the weight of so many tourists may accelerate the sinking of the city's ground. If the World Expo is held, the number of businesspeople and tourists flooding into Venice will at least double, with unimaginable consequences.

After Venice suffered a major flood, the Italian government sought plans to protect the city. A plan widely supported is to build 100 large floodgates on the waterways leading to Venice. In case of danger, operating the main control hub can close all the gates simultaneously. However, this project requires $2.6 billion in funding. With Italy's current financial situation, it is difficult to raise such a large sum.

　　水城威尼斯的忧虑
　　陈封
    多数去意大利旅游的人都不会放弃观光威尼斯的机会。这个已有1200年历史的著名水城今年10月被世界博览会筹委会定为2000年博览会的候选会址，另两个候选地点是加拿大的多伦多市和联邦德国的汉诺威市。
    奇怪得很，威尼斯市民和许多意大利其他地方的人士听到这个消息后并不感到欣喜，反而忧心忡忡。
    威尼斯位于意大利北部濒临亚得里亚海的北端，地势低洼，1966年曾因海水倒灌成灾，历史文物损失巨大。据专家测算，威尼斯自本世纪初以来已经下沉了9英寸，市民们经常担心水灾的威胁。市政当局说1920年以前，市内的圣马可广场平均每年有7次积水成湖，近年来则增加到每年45次。加之因地表温度趋升，海水普遍上涨已无法避免，威尼斯市全部被淹没的悲剧随时可能发生。
    威尼斯市政府人员说，在旅游旺季，每天约有8万游客光临，相当于威尼斯全市人口。这不但超过了该市的接待能力，而且众多游客的重量可能加速市区地面的下沉速度。如果举行世界博览会，每天涌入威尼斯的商人和观光者将至少增加一倍，后果不堪想象。
    意大利政府在威尼斯市遭受大水灾之后就征求过保护该市的方案。一项被多数人赞同的方案是，在通往威尼斯市的各条水道上修筑100个巨大的防海水倒灌闸门，一旦发生险情，操纵总枢纽即可使所有闸门同时关闭，但是这项工程需要资金26亿美元。按目前意大利的财力，这笔巨款尚难以筹措。
