Economic Measures Column

The implementation of anti-corruption measures has curbed the trend of lavish official banquets, impacting the food service industry across various regions. However, the state-owned food service industry in Jingzhou, Hubei Province, has gradually emerged from its difficulties.

When asked about the reasons, they are open about it and will share three strategies with you.

**State-Owned Restaurants Set Up Stalls**

State-owned restaurants, with their luxurious decor, advanced equipment, and strong technical teams, previously mainly catered to high-end banquets.

The Jingzhou Hotel's Lougu Banquet Hall is located in the bustling area of Jingzhou and was once a popular spot for official banquets. With the arrival of the anti-corruption wind, the practice of paying with checks for banquets has ceased.

In this situation, they set up two early and late supply points at the restaurant entrance, offering braised and cured products and various snacks. They used breakfast and night markets to make up for the loss of revenue from banquets, with daily sales increasing from over 800 yuan in early August to over 1800 yuan.

**“Imperial Kitchen” Welcomes the Common People**

Juzhen Garden is a well-known century-old restaurant in the Jingzhou region. It is said that the founder of the restaurant once served as the imperial chef for Empress Dowager Cixi, hence the locals jokingly refer to it as the “Imperial Kitchen.” The luxurious decor of Juzhen Garden has long been focused on high-end banquets, with the cheapest dish costing over ten yuan, making it inaccessible for ordinary people. Since mid-August, they have changed their business approach, lowered the banquet grade, adjusted the menu structure, and increased the sale of mass-market food. They reduced the profit margin from the previous 35% to 25%–30%. Now, a banquet can be booked for forty to fifty yuan, and two to three dishes can be ordered in an air-conditioned, luxurious private room. This change has been well-received by customers. Residents coming to dine, groups looking to improve their lives, and even nearby government agencies and enterprises holding meetings have started coming here. Customers from Sandushi and other places travel tens of miles to enjoy the famous dishes such as Eight Treasure Rice and Thousand-Layer Pork. Since late August, the revenue has started to rise rapidly. Currently, the daily income is around 3000 yuan.

**Improving Service to Attract Customers**

In early September, a large-scale “Create Three Bests” (supplying high-quality products, providing high-quality service, and creating a beautiful environment) 100-day competition was launched across the state-owned food service industry in the region. To attract more customers, they have restored some old service traditions and added new service items.

Currently, restaurants and inns in the area have extended their business hours by more than three hours. Some large restaurants and famous buildings have changed their past habit of closing for lunch, operating continuously. Many restaurants have changed their past habit of waiting for customers to come in, providing door-to-door service. Some top chefs and first-class chefs, who were rarely seen in the kitchen, are now providing services at customers' requests. Large restaurants and famous buildings do not neglect small customers. When a customer enters, they are greeted with a towel and a cup of tea, and a server attends to the table.

First-class service has attracted a steady stream of customers, and state-owned restaurants are once again bustling with activity.

### 公宴冷却以后

　　公宴冷却以后
　　唐卫林
    廉政措施冷却了公宴风，冲击了各地的饮食业。湖北省荆州地区国营饮食业却逐步走出了困境。
    究其原因，他们也不保密，会告诉你三条对策。
        国营店出摊点
      国营店家，其装饰豪华，设备精良，技术力量强，过去接待的一般都是高档的宴会。
    荆州饭店鼓楼宴地处荆州闹市区，过去是公款吃喝的集中去处。廉政之风吹入楼，支票吃喝没有了。
    在这种情况下，他们先后在店门口搭起两个早、晚供应点，供应卤腊制品，各种风味小吃，用早点、夜市弥补了酒席下降的收入，日销货由8月初的800多元上升到1800多元。
    “御膳房”迎“百姓”
    聚珍园是荆沙地区知名度颇高的百年老店，据说此店创办人曾为慈禧太后当过御厨，因此当地百姓戏称此店为
  “御膳房”，装饰豪华的聚珍园长期经营高档酒席，一道最便宜的菜也得上十元，寻常百姓谁敢问津！8月中旬以来，他们转变经营作风，降低酒席档次，改变菜肴结构，多卖大众食品，薄利多销，把毛利率由过去的35％降低到25％—30％。如今，四五十元也能包一桌席，点两三个菜也能进入有空调的豪华雅室。这一变，深受顾客的欢迎。居民们请客的来了，群众想改善生活的来了，就连附近的机关、企业召开会议也来此吃份饭，更有沙市等地的顾客跑一二十里路，来店里品尝名菜八宝饭、千张肉等。从8月下旬开始，营业额开始迅速回升。目前日均收入可达3000元左右。
    改进服务招客源
    9月初，一个声势浩大的
  “创三优”（即：供应优质商品，提供优质服务，创造优美环境）百日竞赛活动在全区国营饮食业蓬勃开展。为了广招客源，他们既恢复了一些老的服务传统，又增添了新的服务项目。
      目前，这里的饭店、酒家普遍延长营业时间三个小时以上，一些大店名楼一改过去中午停堂休息的习惯，连堂作业。不少酒店一改过去坐等顾客上门的老习惯，服务上门，一些过去难得上灶的特级厨师、一级厨师也纷纷按客户要求上门服务。大店名楼不因零客而慢怠，顾客进门问一声好，递一条毛巾，酌一杯清茶，服务员跟桌服务。
    第一流的服务，吸引了源源不断的客源，国营店家又是顾客盈门了。
