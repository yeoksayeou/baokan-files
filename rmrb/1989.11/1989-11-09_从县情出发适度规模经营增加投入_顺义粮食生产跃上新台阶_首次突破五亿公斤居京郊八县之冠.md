A traditional grain-producing area in the Beijing suburbs, Shunyi County, has seen a year-on-year bumper harvest of grain since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This year, it has once again brought good news: grain production has exceeded 500 million kilograms for the first time, ranking first among the eight counties in the Beijing suburbs, and other industries have also achieved encouraging results.

County Magistrate Wu Guiyun cited statistics to say that in 1978, Shunyi County produced 290 million kilograms of grain. By 1988, this had increased to 495 million kilograms, and it is estimated that this year it will reach 510 million kilograms. Sideline production is also thriving, with 500,000 pigs, 23.5 million kilograms of fresh eggs, 9.5 million kilograms of fresh fish, 5.07 million chickens, 3.96 million ducks, 250 million kilograms of vegetables, as well as 48,000 mu of orchards and 30,000 mu of watermelons. Therefore, this county is known as the "grain and sideline food base" of Beijing.

Over the past few years, Shunyi County has made significant contributions to the state. According to Magistrate Wu, the county has delivered 500 million kilograms of contracted grain, accounting for 1/4 of the city's task, and has completed the summer grain season for three consecutive years. Each year, it also sells an additional 125 million kilograms of negotiated grain, and last year it was honored as a national advanced grain-selling county. This year, it provided the city with 500,000 pigs, accounting for 1/4 of the city's total; 20 million kilograms of fresh eggs, accounting for 1/6 of the city's total; and the fresh fish, chickens, and ducks it provided accounted for the first, 1/3, and 1/2 of the city's total, respectively. Entering Shunyi, one can clearly see its increasingly prosperous appearance from the fields and villages. Last year, the per capita income of Shunyi's agricultural population was 1,217 yuan.

Shunyi County's grain production once experienced stagnation. Later, the county started from its own local conditions, choosing appropriate scale management, solving some unfavorable factors in grain production, and providing conditions for the transformation to modern agriculture.

According to Deputy Secretary of the County Committee Liu Baocheng, of the 220,000 laborers in the county, only 27,000 are now engaged in grain production, with the rest basically transferred to township enterprises and diversified operations. The income from grain production is higher than that from township enterprises and diversified operations, which has increased the enthusiasm for farming. At the same time, the county, township, and village levels all attach great importance to investment in agriculture. Over the past three years, 200 million yuan has been invested, and various agricultural machinery has been purchased. Currently, the county has more than 2,000 large and medium-sized tractors, more than 800 combine harvesters, more than 200 corn harvesters, more than 800 large and medium-sized seeders, more than 80 large sprayers, and more than 1,500 sets of sprinkler irrigation equipment. The county's 700,000 mu of cultivated land and 620,000 mu of grain crops are all mechanized in terms of plowing, sowing, harvesting, and transportation. This not only improves production levels and disaster resistance but also shortens agricultural labor, leading to a reform of the cultivation system. What was previously a single crop can now be two crops, increasing land use by 23%. In addition, various professional teams have been established to promote and apply new technologies, provide pre- and post-production services, and strive to promote agriculture to a new level.

    从县情出发适度规模经营增加投入
    顺义粮食生产跃上新台阶
    首次突破五亿公斤居京郊八县之冠
    本报北京11月8日讯　京郊传统产粮区——顺义县在党的十一届三中全会后粮食年年丰收的基础上，今又传来喜讯：粮食第一次突破5亿公斤，位居京郊8县之首，其他各业也取得了令人鼓舞的成绩。
    县长吴桂云援引统计数字说，1978年，顺义县粮食只有2.9亿公斤，1988年上升为4.95亿公斤，预计今年可达5.1亿公斤。副业生产也很兴旺，今年生猪50万头，鲜蛋2350万公斤，鲜鱼950万公斤，肉鸡507万只，肉鸭396万只，蔬菜2.5亿公斤，还有4.8万亩果园和3万亩西瓜。因此，这个县被誉为北京市的“粮食和副食基地”。
    几年来，顺义县对国家的贡献是大的。据吴县长介绍，这个县上交定购粮0.5亿公斤，占全市任务的1／4，已连续3年在夏粮一季完成，每年还多卖议购粮1.25亿公斤，去年荣获全国售粮先进县；今年为市里提供生猪50万头，占全市1／4；鲜蛋2000万公斤，占全市1／6；提供的鲜鱼、肉鸡、肉鸭，则分别占全市的第一、1／3和1／2。进入顺义，从地头村容，人们能明显领略到它日益富足起来的风貌。去年，顺义农业人口人均收入1217元。
    顺义县的粮食曾一度有过徘徊，后来县里从自己的县情出发，选择了适度规模经营，解决了粮食生产上遇到的一些不利因素，为向现代农业转化提供了条件。
    据县委副书记刘宝成介绍，全县22万劳力，现在从事粮食生产的只有2.7万多人，其余基本上已转移到乡镇企业和多种经营。从事粮食生产的收入高于从事乡镇企业和多种经营的收入，提高了种田的积极性。同时，县、乡、村三级又十分重视对农业的投入，3年来投资2亿元，添置各种农机。目前，全县已拥有大中型拖拉机2000多台，联合收割机800多台，玉米收割机200多台，大中型播种机800多台，大型喷药车80多台，喷灌设备1500多套。全县70万亩耕地、62万亩粮食作物，耕、种、收、运等全部用上了机器。这不仅提高了生产水平，提高了抗灾能力，也缩短了农耗，致使耕作制度得到了改革。过去种一茬作物的，现在可以种二茬作物，土地利用率提高了23％。除此，还建立各种专业队，推广运用新技术，做好产前产后服务，努力促进农业登上新台阶。
