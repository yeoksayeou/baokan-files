Recently, the U.S. Congress passed the "1989 Emergency Waiver of Chinese Immigration Act," deciding to exempt all Chinese students with J-1 visas from the requirement to return to their home country for two years of service after completing their studies. Previously, the U.S. Congress also passed the so-called "State Department Authorization Act" and its amendments to sanction China. Certain individuals in the U.S. Congress are attempting to impose pressure on China through economic and political sanctions, rudely interfering in China's internal affairs, and damaging Sino-American relations. The Chinese people cannot but express great indignation and strong protest against this.

The actions of the U.S. Congress are another serious step to deteriorate Sino-American relations. According to U.S. immigration law, foreign scholars and students with J-1 visas must return to their home country to reside for two years before they can return to the U.S. to change their visa status. Before this, they cannot change their non-immigrant status. It is completely in line with international practice for countries to require their government-sponsored students to return to serve their home country. As early as 1978, the two sides reached an understanding on mutual exchanges of students and scholars. In 1985, they signed the "Agreement on the Exchange of Students and Scholars between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America." In 1987, during a visit by the leadership of China's State Education Commission to the U.S., talks were held with the U.S. Information Agency on Sino-American educational exchanges, and the "Joint News Release on Sino-American Educational Talks" was issued. The release stated: "The two sides discussed the U.S. legal regulations on foreign students returning to their home country after completing their studies and the necessity of ensuring the fundamental goal of promoting Sino-American educational exchanges." "The U.S. side believes that the U.S. laws on foreign students apply to all foreign students, including the requirement for foreign students to return to their home country for two years of service after completing their studies." The U.S. also acknowledged in the release, "If foreign students coming to the U.S. do not return to their home country to serve after acquiring skills and knowledge, the purpose of U.S. international exchanges cannot be achieved." However, the so-called emergency waiver of Chinese immigration law passed by the U.S. Congress is contrary to the spirit of the release recognized by the U.S. government itself. This arbitrary tearing up of agreements reached by both sides and imposing one's will on others is a complete violation of international norms and a manifestation of hegemony.

Over the past decade, the governments and peoples of China and the U.S. have achieved gratifying results through exchanges and cooperation in culture, science, education, and other fields. Countless facts show that such cooperation between China and the U.S. is beneficial to the development and consolidation of relations between the two countries and also promotes the progress of human science and cultural prosperity. Now, some people in the U.S. Congress are breaking the agreements reached between China and the U.S., which not only harms the interests of China but also damages the interests of the American people.

When the U.S. Congress amended this law, it claimed that it was doing so to supposedly protect Chinese students in the U.S. from "persecution." This legislative basis is not only groundless but also extremely absurd. After the June 4th incident, the Chinese government has repeatedly stated that for those who participated in marches, demonstrations, hunger strikes, or expressed support, the government adopts a lenient policy and does not pursue them. For those overseas, including in the U.S., students and scholars who took certain actions without knowing the truth, the government will certainly not pursue them. Therefore, there is no question of persecution. According to statistics from relevant Chinese departments, since June 4th, more than 300 overseas students have returned to their motherland, and many more have returned for vacations, family visits, or official trips. They have been warmly welcomed upon their return, and the issues of discrimination and persecution are pure fabrications. For the vast number of overseas students, the motherland has been eagerly awaiting their return after completing their studies to contribute to the modernization of the motherland. The Chinese government has also been working to improve the working conditions and living standards of returning students, so that they can put their knowledge to use and fully utilize their talents. Over the past decade, a large number of students have returned to serve their motherland, which shows that the Chinese government's policy of sending and placing students overseas is completely correct and also shows that the hearts of overseas students and their motherland are connected. Now, the U.S. Congress is attempting to unilaterally break the agreements that have been reached, and one cannot help but suspect their intentions.

It should be noted that there are always some people in the U.S. Congress who harbor hostility towards socialist China and view Sino-American relations with prejudice. Since June 4th, they have repeatedly set obstacles in Sino-American relations under the guise of "human rights," trampled on basic principles of international relations, and unreasonably interfered in China's internal affairs. This hegemonic and imperialist behavior only exposes their arrogance and shallowness. If they think that a few sanctions can make the Chinese people surrender, it only shows that they know nothing about the spirit of the Chinese nation, which has never yielded to external pressure. The Chinese people have long been aware of various forms of sanctions from the outside world. Sanctions have never crushed us in the past, and they will never make us yield in the future. We hope that the U.S. administration will assess the situation, prioritize the overall interests of Sino-American relations, and have the president veto this bill to prevent a few people in Congress from leading Sino-American relations astray.

　　恶化中美关系的一个严重步骤
　　本报评论员
    近日，美国国会通过了《1989年紧急放宽中国移民法案》，决定豁免全部持J—1签证的中国留学人员在学业期满后必须回国服务两年的限制。此前，美国国会还通过了制裁中国的所谓《国务院授权法》及其修正案。美国国会中的某些人企图通过经济和政治制裁手段向中国施加压力，粗暴干涉中国内政，破坏中美关系，对此，中国人民不能不表示极大的愤慨和强烈的抗议。
    美国国会的这些作法是恶化中美关系的又一严重步骤。根据美国移民法，持J—1签证的外国学者和学生在学业结束后，必须回国定居两年后才能再次前往美国改变签证种类。在此之前不能改变其非移民身份。各国要求自己的公费留学人员回国服务是完全符合国际惯例的。早在1978年，中美双方就达成互派留学生和学者的谅解。1985年又签署了《关于中华人民共和国与美利坚合众国之间交换留学生与学者的议定书》。1987年，中国教委领导人访问美国时，与美国新闻总署就中美教育交流举行了会谈并发表了《中美教育会谈新闻公报》。该公报指出：“双方讨论了美国关于外国留学人员在学业结束后返回本国的法律规定和确保中美教育交流的根本目标得以推进的必要性。”“美国方面认为，美国关于外国留学人员的法律适用于所有的外国留学人员，包括外国留学人员需要按有关规定学成后回国服务两年的要求”。美国还在公报中承认，“如果来美国的外国留学人员在学到了技能与知识后不回本国服务，美国进行国际交流的目的就无法达到”。但是，美国国会通过的这个所谓紧急放宽中国移民法案却与美国政府自己认可的公报精神背道而驰。这种任意撕毁双方达成的协议，把自己的意志强加于人的作法，完全违背国际准则，是一种强权政治的表现。
    十年来，中美两国政府和两国人民通过文化、科研、教育等方面的交流和合作取得了可喜的成果。无数事实表明，中美两国之间的这种合作有利于两国关系的发展和巩固，也有利于促进人类的科学进步和文化繁荣。现在美国国会中的一部分人破坏中美两国达成的协议，不仅是对中国利益的损害，同时也有损于美国人民的利益。
    美国国会在修改这一法案时，辩称这样作是为了所谓保护中国留美学生不受“迫害”，这种立法依据不仅毫无根据，也是十分荒谬的。“六·四”事件之后，中国政府一再重申，对于参加过游行、示威、绝食或是声援的人，政府采取宽大政策，不予追究。对于远在国外包括美国的留学生和学者，在不了解真相的情况下所采取的一些行动，就更不会追究了。因此，根本不存在什么迫害问题。据中国有关部门统计，自6月4日以来，已有300多名留美人员回到祖国，还有更多的人回国休假、探亲或公务旅行，他们回国后受到热烈的欢迎，歧视和迫害的问题纯属无稽之谈。对于广大海外学子，祖国母亲一直殷切地期待着他们学成归来为实现祖国的四个现代化效力。中国政府也一直在努力采取措施不断地改善归国留学人员的工作条件和生活待遇，使他们能够学以致用，充分发挥他们的聪明才智。十年来，大批莘莘学子回国报效祖国，这说明中国政府派遣和安置留学生的政策是完全正确的，也说明海外游子和祖国母亲的心是相通的。现在美国国会企图单方面破坏业已达成的协议，究竟要干什么，不能不使人怀疑。
    应该看到，美国国会中总有那么一部分人对社会主义的中国怀有敌意，用偏见对待中美关系。“六·四”以来，他们以“人权”为由在中美关系中一再设置障碍，肆意践踏国际关系中的基本准则，无理干涉我国内政，这种强权政治和霸权主义行径，只能暴露他们的狂妄和浅薄。如果他们认为，通过几条制裁措施就可以使中国人民束手就范，那就只能说明他们对中华民族从不屈服于外来压力的精神一无所知。中国人民对外来的形形色色的制裁早有所识，制裁过去未曾压垮我们，今后也绝不会使我们屈服。我们希望美国行政当局审时度势，以中美关系的大局为重，由总统否决这一法案，不要让国会一部分人把中美关系引向歧途。
