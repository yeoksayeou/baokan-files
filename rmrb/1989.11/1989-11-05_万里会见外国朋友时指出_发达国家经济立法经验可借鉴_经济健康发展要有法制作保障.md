Wan Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, met today with the Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization of the United Nations, Mr. Arpad Bogsch, and representatives from various countries attending the "International Seminar on Combating Unfair Competition" in the Great Hall of the People.

Wan Li said that Mr. Bogsch often visits China and is an old friend of China. Recently, he has participated in three international conferences in Beijing. These conferences have greatly helped to promote mutual understanding between China and other countries.

Wan Li pointed out that China is a developing socialist country, and the time it has implemented a planned commodity economy is not long. Laws in the economic, cultural, and other fields are not yet complete. China should learn from the experiences of developed countries in economic legislation.

He said that in recent years, China's economy has developed too rapidly, and economic order has become somewhat chaotic. China plans to spend three years on rectification and adjustment to bring economic development under the rule of law.

Bogsch said that China has already formulated a very modern trademark law and a relatively successful patent law, and is in the process of formulating a copyright law to protect the rights of authors. He hopes that the National People's Congress will promote the formulation of the latter two laws, so that China's intellectual property laws will be more complete. This will not only be beneficial to China's economic development but also to exchanges between China and foreign countries. The World Intellectual Property Organization of the United Nations will continue to make efforts in this regard.

The "International Seminar on Combating Unfair Competition" was held in Beijing from November 3 to 6. Experts from the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, and seven other countries, as well as representatives from China, India, Malaysia, and other countries, a total of more than 90 people, attended the conference.

    万里会见外国朋友时指出
    发达国家经济立法经验可借鉴  经济健康发展要有法制作保障
    新华社北京11月4日电　（记者张虎臣）全国人大常委会委员长万里今天在人民大会堂会见了联合国世界知识产权组织总干事鲍格胥和正在这里出席“反不正当竞争国际研讨会”的各国代表。
    万里说，鲍格胥先生经常来中国，是中国的老朋友。最近，他在北京连续参加了3次国际会议。这些会议对促进中国和其他国家的相互了解有很大帮助。
    万里指出，中国是发展中的社会主义国家，实行有计划的商品经济的时间不长，在经济、文化等领域里的法律还不够完备。中国要借鉴发达国家在经济立法方面的经验。
    他说，这几年中国经济发展有些过热，经济秩序有些混乱。中国打算用3年的时间进行治理整顿，把经济发展纳入法制的轨道。
    鲍格胥说，中国已制定了非常现代的商标法和比较成功的专利法，正在制定保护作家权益的版权法，还要制定反不正当竞争法。他希望全国人大促进后两部法律的制定，这样中国的知识产权方面的法律就比较完备了。这不仅对中国的经济发展有好处，对中国与外国的交流也有好处。联合国世界知识产权组织将继续为此作出努力。
    “反不正当竞争国际研讨会”于本月3日至6日在北京召开。来自联邦德国、意大利等7个国家的专家以及来自中国、印度、马来西亚等国家的代表共90多人出席了这次会议。
