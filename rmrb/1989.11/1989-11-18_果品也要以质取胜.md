Fruits Must Compete Through Quality

In recent years, the development of fruit production in our country has been rapid. As the variety of products increases, competition becomes inevitable. Just like industrial products, agricultural products must rely on quality to win in competition.

Shandong Province's Qixia County, famous for its apples, realized this several years ago. Over the past few years, they have focused on technological upgrades, similar to how factories do, covering a series of technological improvements from apple variety updates to cultivation techniques and transportation and storage. This has significantly improved the quality of their fruits, demonstrating foresight worthy of attention from all regions.

Currently, the international market sees rapid updates in fruit varieties and the emergence of new technologies. However, in some places in our country, while fruit production has developed rapidly in recent years, there has been less attention paid to technological upgrades. Varieties are outdated, cultivation methods are backward, and the same practices have been used for decades. Some fruits that once enjoyed a good reputation in the international market have now lost their luster. This is something that all fruit farmers and fruit tree technicians should pay attention to. We must muster our strength to catch up with the pace of the international market. Only high quality can lead to a large market. Whether in the international market or the domestic market, there is a demand for high-quality fruits. It is hoped that strengthening technological upgrades and increasing high-quality fruits will become a unanimous action for all fruit farmers.

    果品也要以质取胜
    雯旻
    近几年，我国果品发展迅速。产品一多，竞争就在所难免。和工业品一样，农副产品在竞争中靠什么取胜呢？只能靠提高质量取胜。
    我国久负盛名的苹果产地山东省栖霞县，早在几年前就意识到这一点。几年来，他们如同工厂企业狠抓技术改造一样，抓了苹果从品种更新到栽培技术和运输储存等一系列技术改造工作，使果品质量大大提高，这是有远见的做法，值得各地重视。
    现在，国际市场果品品种更新很快，新技术层出不穷。而我们有些地方这些年果品发展很快，却较少注意技术改造工作。品种老化，栽培方法落后，几十年一贯制；一些原在国际市场享有盛誉的果品，如今也失去了光彩。这是很值得广大果农和果树技术人员注意的。我们应憋足力气，追上国际市场前进的步伐。只有高质量，才有大市场，无论是国际市场还是国内市场，都在呼唤高质量的果品。希望加强技术改造，增加优质果品能成为广大果农一致的行动。
