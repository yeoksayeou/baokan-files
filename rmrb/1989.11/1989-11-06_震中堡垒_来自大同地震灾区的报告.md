On the night of October 18, 1989, a powerful earthquake struck the mountains and hills of Datong, Yanggao, Hunsuan, and Guangling. Houses collapsed, mines caved in, and dust billowed. In the cold night wind, groups of men, women, and children suddenly found themselves homeless.

At this critical moment, the local grassroots party organizations and the vast majority of Communist Party members stepped forward, sparing no effort to protect the safety of the people. In the temporary shelters, the victims, whenever they mentioned this, would excitedly say, "Our party members are so good, our cadres are so good!"

Rescue is an order!

In the command center of the Yanbei region and in the rescue teams in the earthquake-stricken area of Datong, reporters met with leaders from the Yanbei Regional Committee, the Regional Government, and various counties and grassroots organizations. During the tense moments of the earthquake, they demonstrated their sincerity and fearlessness with their actions, providing satisfactory answers.

On the night of October 18, just 10 minutes after the earthquake, all the leaders of the Yanbei Regional Committee and the Regional Government who were at home gathered.

"Save people first!" said Wang Shan, the Regional Government Secretary, decisively.

Immediately, the regional earthquake command center was established. Wang Shan, the Secretary, quickly instructed the office to call Datong, Yanggao, Hunsuan, and Guangling to gather information on the disaster and to study rescue measures. He also sent telegrams to each county, stating, "We must treat the rescue work as a campaign, and the responsibility for the work as a military order. This is a command! The disaster area must not allow anyone to freeze or starve to death. If any problems occur in any place, the leaders of that place will be held responsible!"

At the same time, Deputy Secretary Jiang Ximing went to the epicenter; Deputy Secretary Lu Chen went to Guangling and Hunsuan to inspect the disaster; Deputy Secretary Gao Baozhen also led a medical team directly to the disaster area.

The Regional Committee Secretary Xu Shenglan and Deputy Secretary Wang Fushui, who were studying in the province, set out from Taiyuan for the disaster area upon hearing the news of the earthquake on the morning of the 19th.

More than 200 officials from the regional government departments did not even return home and rushed to the disaster area to take charge of villages, working with county and township officials to help the victims.

Before the second strong aftershock occurred, the anti-earthquake command center in Datong County had been established. 20 trucks were dispatched to the disaster area, and the rescue and relief work began in earnest.

In Yanggao County, a few hours after the earthquake, the county magistrate and deputy magistrates rushed to the villages most affected by the disaster, gathered information on the earthquake, and organized rescue efforts. By dawn, they had moved the injured to safe places. Most of the shops in Yanggao County City immediately sent out bread, pastries, and noodles.

Without the Party Branch, it won't do

Some people say, "With production responsibility to the household, we don't need the Party branch." Practice has proven that without the Party branch, it won't do.

When reporters visited the victims in Baogou Village, Datong County, they all praised the Party branch secretary, Liu Jiming.

The first earthquake occurred. Liu Jiming and the Communist Party member, the public security director Liu Yuanmao, immediately rushed to the village committee office and repeatedly broadcasted, "An earthquake has occurred. Please quickly leave your homes and go to a safe place..." After broadcasting for a while, he and the village cadres, despite the aftershocks, went door to door to check if anyone was injured, organizing the people to prevent the earthquake.

When the second 6.1 magnitude strong earthquake occurred, Liu Jiming was repeatedly checking the streets filled with dust to see if anyone had been injured. However, he never expected that his grandmother and father, who had retreated to a safe place and then re-entered the house, were crushed to death under the collapsed wall. In Baogou Village, with 281 households and more than 1,000 people, only Liu Jiming's family had 2 casualties.

On the night of October 18, after the disaster struck, the Party Committee Secretary of Cetu Township, Datong County, Ma Lu, immediately arranged through the telephone for each village to lead the people out of their homes. From the 18th to the 21st, Ma Lu visited all 13 villages in the township, organizing the villagers to resist the earthquake and rescue the disaster-stricken. Thirsty, he drank a mouthful of raw water; hungry, he chewed a piece of biscuit. For several days, he did not sleep well or eat a hot meal. However, he reduced the losses of the entire village to the smallest extent.

In times of crisis, party members first think of the people

In the severely affected village of Houguiren, Yanggao County, we arrived just as the relief supplies were being distributed. The villagers told the reporters that the village committee member Wang Zhiti was in charge of distributing the relief supplies to the entire village, and he let the people take them first, while he did not take a single piece of wood.

After the strong earthquake, Li Zhangshi, a Communist Party member from Dongxiaozhen, Shengquansi Village, Yanggao County, saw the victims sheltering outside their homes and immediately took out 1,500 kilograms of tree roots from his home, distributing them to more than 20 households for warmth. After the second earthquake, seeing that the people were starving and not daring to enter the house to cook, he did not hesitate to ride his bicycle, carrying his own 600 yuan, to the nearby village of Dongjingji in Hebei Province, buying back 350 kilograms of noodles, 25 kilograms of biscuits, and 1,500 sticks of fried dough twists for the villagers.

In Xituanbao Village, Yanggao County, the repeated earthquakes buried the people's food and cooking utensils in the ruins. At this time, the Communist Party member Wang Hui risked his life to retrieve his family's pots and pans and half a sack of rice, using three large stones to set up a pot and boil porridge, calling the surrounding villagers to drink. Drink, boil, drink, boil, for two whole days and nights, people could not remember how many times Wang Hui had boiled porridge for everyone.

During the interviews, many victims had tears in their eyes and choked up as they told the reporters, "During the earthquake, those who went out were the people, and those who went to the dangerous places were the party members and cadres."

The ruthless earthquake brought great misfortune and disaster to the people of the Yanbei earthquake-stricken area. However, from the actions of the leaders at all levels and from every Communist Party member, people saw hope, saw the dawn of tomorrow!

    震中堡垒
    ——来自大同地震灾区的报告
    新华社记者　池茂花　本报记者　阎晓明
    1989年10月18日夜晚，强烈的地震在大同、阳高、浑源、广灵的山山峁峁间发生了：房倒窑塌，尘烟滚滚……寒冷的夜风中，顿时一群群男女老幼无家可归。
    在这危急关头，当地党的基层组织和广大共产党员挺身而出，千方百计保护群众的安全。在那些临时搭的窝棚里，灾民们每谈及此事，都激动地连声说：“我们的党员真好，我们的干部真好”！
    救灾就是命令！
    在雁北地区的指挥部里，在大同震区的抢险队伍中，记者先后见到了雁北地委、行署以及各县和基层的领导干部。在地震的紧张时刻，他们以自己的赤诚和无畏，作出了令人满意的答卷。
    10月18日晚，地震发生后不到10分钟，雁北地委、行署在家的领导就全凑齐了。
    “先救人”！行署专员王善当机立断地说。
    随即地区防震指挥部成立了。王善专员马上让机关给大同、阳高、浑源、广灵打电话，连夜了解灾情，研究救灾措施，并给各县发明传电报，“要把救灾工作作为一个战役去抓，把承包责任作为军令状去落实，这是命令！灾区决不允许发生冻死饿死人的现象，哪个地方发生问题，就追究哪个地方领导的责任！”
    与此同时，地委副书记姜锡铭到了震中地区；副专员陆晨日前往广灵、浑源察看灾情；副专员高葆珍也率领医疗队直赴灾区。
    正在省里学习的地委书记徐生岚和行署副专员王福水得知地震消息后，于19日上午从太原出发直奔灾区。
    雁北地直机关的200多名干部有的连家也没回，也赶赴灾区，包乡包村，与县乡干部一起，为灾民排忧解难。
    第二次强震还未发生，大同县的抗震指挥部就成立了。20辆汽车派到了灾区，投入了紧张的抢险救灾。
    在阳高县，地震发生后几个小时，县长、副县长就赶到灾情最重的村子，了解震情并组织救护，天亮已把受伤群众转移到安全地带。阳高县城大部分商店内的面包、糕点和挂面也立即送去。
    离开了党支部不行
    有人说，“包产到了户，不要党支部”。实践证明，离开党支部不行。
    记者在大同县堡村，踏着废墟访问灾民时，他们都连声夸奖党支部书记刘继明。
    第一次地震发生了。刘继明和共产党员、治保主任刘元茂立即赶到村委会办公室，向全村反复广播：“现在发生了地震，请大家赶快从家里出来，赶快到安全地方……”广播了一阵后，他又和村干部们冒着余震挨家逐户察看有无遇难乡亲，组织群众防震。
    第二次6.1级强烈地震发生时，刘继明正在尘雾腾腾的街上反复查看有没有群众发生意外，但万万没想到已撤到安全地带后又进了屋的奶奶和父亲被活活压进了坍倒的墙下。堡村281户人家、1000余口人，只有刘继明家2人遇难。
    10月18日晚，灾难降临后，大同县册田乡党委书记马录立即通过电话，布置各村带领群众从房中撤出。从18日到21日，马录跑遍全乡13个村庄，组织乡亲抗震救灾。渴了喝口生水，饿了嚼块饼干，几天中他没睡过一次好觉，吃过一顿热饭，然而，却使全村的损失减少到了最小程度。
    危急时党员首先想到的是群众
    在重灾村阳高县后贵仁村，我们去时正赶上分发救灾物资。村民告诉记者，村支委王志体，管全村救灾物资发放，他先让群众领，而自己一根木料也没领。
    强震过后，阳高县东小村镇神泉寺村共产党员李掌世，看到灾民们在屋外露宿，便毫不犹豫地把自家的1500公斤树根拿出来，分给20多户群众生火取暖。第二次地震后，群众不敢进屋做饭，他看到群众挨饿，二话不说，骑上自行车，揣上自己的600元钱，赶到了附近的河北省东井集给村民买回挂面350公斤，饼干25公斤，麻花1500根。
    阳高县西团堡村，一次次的地震，把群众的粮食和炊具埋进了废墟。此时，共产党员王辉冒险抢出了自家的锅碗和半袋小米，用三块大石头架起锅熬开了稀饭，招呼周围的乡亲们喝。喝了熬，熬了喝，整整两天两夜，人们记不清王辉给大家熬了多少次稀饭。
    在采访时，许多灾民眼里噙着泪花哽咽着对记者说：“地震时往外走的是群众，往危险地方去的是党员和干部。”
    无情的地震，给雁北震区的人民带来了巨大的不幸和灾难，然而，从各级领导干部身上，从每个共产党员身上，人们又看到了希望，看到了明天的曙光！
