Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, November 6th — Reporters recently learned from the Taiyuan City Tobacco Monopoly Bureau that two tobacco companies in Dingzhou City and Wangdu County, Hebei Province, have disregarded the state's tobacco monopoly regulations, selling purchase permits and accounts to tobacco dealers, severely disrupting the national cigarette market.

In early September this year, farmers Zhao Xiaojun and Zhao Wenhui from Xinle County, Hebei Province, transferred over 100,000 yuan in cash to the account of Dingzhou City Tobacco Company in Hebei Province. After deducting a 2.5% handling fee, Dingzhou City Tobacco Company transferred the funds to the purchasing unit designated by Zhao Xiaojun and Zhao Wenhui — the Jinzhong Region Tobacco Branch Company in Shanxi Province — in the name of Dingzhou City Tobacco Company, and issued purchase permits for the two tobacco dealers. Zhao Xiaojun and Zhao Wenhui then "legitimately" purchased 60 cases of Ju Hongmei brand cigarettes and 420 cases of Jing Taiyuan brand cigarettes from the Jinzhong Region Tobacco Branch Company. Subsequently, they sold Ju Hongmei cigarettes at a high price of 2.40 yuan per pack (the state price is 0.79 yuan per pack) in the Taiyuan market. They were caught by the Taiyuan City Tobacco Monopoly Bureau while conducting transactions with tobacco dealers in Taiyuan.

It was reported that as early as January this year, tobacco dealers Xie Zengjun, He Zhenzhuang, and He Yuehan from Xinle County, Hebei Province, were caught by the Taiyuan City Tobacco Monopoly Bureau for illegally reselling cigarettes in Taiyuan. Upon investigation, the three dealers had used the purchase permits and accounts of Wangdu County Tobacco Company in Hebei Province to purchase 200 cases of Ju Guihua brand cigarettes and 430 cases of Jian Taiyuan brand cigarettes, valued at over 160,000 yuan, from the Lvliang Region Tobacco Company in Shanxi Province. At that time, the three dealers had already sold 152 cases of Ju Guihua brand cigarettes at a price higher than the state price of 0.47 yuan per pack to tobacco dealers in Taiyuan.

    肥了烟贩子　苦了老百姓
    河北两烟草公司扰乱市场
    新华社太原11月6日电  （记者冀惠斌、太原日报记者温玉星）记者日前从太原市烟草专卖局获悉：河北省定州市、望都县两家烟草公司无视国家烟草专卖条例，向烟贩子出卖购烟手续和帐户，严重扰乱了国家卷烟市场。
    今年9月上旬，河北省新乐县农民赵小军、赵文辉将10余万元现款汇进河北省定州市烟草公司的帐上，定州市烟草公司在抽取2.5％的手续费之后，以定州市烟草公司的名义将款汇至赵小军、赵文辉指定的购烟单位——山西省晋中地区烟草分公司，并为这两名烟贩出具了定州市烟草公司的购烟手续。赵小军、赵文辉便“合理合法”地从晋中地区烟草分公司购到咀红梅牌香烟60件，精太原牌香烟420件，随后在太原市以2.40元一盒（国家牌价0.79元一盒）的高价在市场上抛售咀红梅。当他俩与太原市的烟贩子进行交易时，被太原市烟草专卖局抓获。
    据介绍，早在今年元月，河北新乐县烟贩子谢增军、何振庄、何月山三人在太原市非法倒卖卷烟时，被太原市烟草专卖局抓获。经查，这三个烟贩是利用河北省望都县烟草公司的购烟手续和帐户从山西省吕梁地区烟草公司套购到咀桂花牌香烟200件，简太原牌香烟430件，价值16万余元。当时三烟贩已将152件咀桂花牌香烟以每盒高于国家牌价0.47元的价格倒卖给太原市的烟贩子。
