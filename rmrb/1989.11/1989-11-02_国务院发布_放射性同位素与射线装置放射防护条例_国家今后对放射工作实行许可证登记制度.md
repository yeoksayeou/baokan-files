The State Council has issued the "Regulations on Radiation Protection for Radioactive Isotopes and Radiation Devices" to strengthen the supervision and management of radiation protection for radioactive isotopes and radiation devices, and to ensure the health and safety of personnel engaged in radiation work and the public. Premier Li Peng signed State Council Order No. 44 on October 24, 1989, to promulgate the "Regulations on Radiation Protection for Radioactive Isotopes and Radiation Devices."

The "Regulations" stipulate that the state will implement a licensing and registration system for radiation work. Newly constructed, reconstructed, or expanded radiation work sites must have their radiation protection facilities inspected and approved by relevant departments such as health, public security, and environmental protection before they can be put into use. For sites involving the discharge of radioactive wastewater, radioactive gases, and solid radioactive waste, an environmental impact report must be submitted to the environmental protection departments of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government for approval before registration can be completed.

In terms of radiation protection management, the "Regulations" stipulate that the superior administrative departments of units engaged in radiation work are responsible for managing the radiation protection work within their systems. Production, use, and storage sites for radioactive isotopes, as well as production and use sites for radiation devices, must be equipped with protective facilities. The entrances to these sites must be marked with radiation symbols and necessary protective safety interlocks, alarm devices, or work signals.

The "Regulations" also provide specific provisions for the management of radiation accidents, radiation protection supervision, and penalties for violations of these regulations. The "Regulations" clearly state that if a radiation accident occurs due to a violation of these regulations but has not caused serious consequences, it can be punished by the public security organs in accordance with the "Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security." For those who cause serious consequences and constitute a crime, criminal responsibility shall be investigated by the judicial organs in accordance with the law.

    国务院发布
    放射性同位素与射线装置放射防护条例
    国家今后对放射工作实行许可证登记制度
    新华社北京11月1日电  为加强对放射性同位素与射线装置放射防护的监督管理，保障从事放射工作人员和公众的健康与安全，国务院总理李鹏于1989年10月24日签署了第44号国务院令，发布《放射性同位素与射线装置放射防护条例》。
    《条例》规定，国家今后对放射工作实行许可证登记制度。凡属新建、改建、扩建放射工作场所的放射防护设施，竣工后须经卫生、公安、环境保护等有关部门验收同意，获得许可证后方可启用。涉及到放射性废水、废气、固体废物排放的，还必须先向省、自治区、直辖市的环保部门递交环境影响报告书，经批准后方可登记。
    在放射防护管理上，《条例》规定，从事放射工作单位的上级行政管理部门，负责管理本系统的放射防护工作。在放射性同位素生产、使用、贮存场所和射线装置的生产、使用场所必须设置防护设施。其入口处必须设置放射性标志和必要的防护安全联锁、报警装置或者工作信号。
    《条例》还就放射事故管理、放射防护监督、以及违反这个条例的行为进行处罚等均做了具体的规定。《条例》明示，由于违反本条例而发生放射事故尚未造成严重后果的，可以由公安机关按照《治安管理处罚条例》予以处罚；对造成严重后果，构成犯罪的，由司法机关依法追究刑事责任。
