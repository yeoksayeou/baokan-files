Secret Marriages
– A Serious Social Problem

According to some village cadres in our county, the phenomenon of early and secret marriages among rural youth has significantly increased and has become a relatively serious social problem. A recent investigation in Tian Tai Shan Town in our county found 38 couples of married youth who needed to have their marriage registrations completed. In one small village of a thousand people, 9 cases of secret marriages were discovered. The causes of this phenomenon are as follows:

First, some peasants are influenced by the idea of continuing the family line, using every means to hasten their children's marriages. Some even arrange marriages for their children when they are still infants. The Marriage Law stipulates the minimum marriageable age as 22 for men and 20 for women, but most of the current early marriages occur between the ages of 17 and 20. Since they are not of legal age, they marry in secret.

Second, the trafficking of women leads to hasty marriages. According to reports from the public security and women's departments, cases of trafficking women have increased in recent years, with over 800 women from other places being kidnapped and married to local youth in our county. These women almost all lack household registration documents and cannot register their marriages, but the men, eager to take a wife, mostly force the marriages. This problem is quite prominent in some rural areas and has become a blind spot for secret marriages.

Third, the parties involved avoid paying fees. In recent years, some places, in order to implement family planning, have required a certain amount of family planning guarantee deposit to be paid at the time of marriage registration. If the couple follows the regulations for family planning after marriage, the deposit will be refunded; otherwise, the deposit will be confiscated. Currently, many peasants lack awareness of family planning, although they do not dare to have more than the allowed number of children, they also do not want to obtain a certificate for a single child. Thus, the guarantee deposit is paid but not refunded. This local policy has led to a local countermeasure among the peasants: they simply do not register and marry in secret to avoid paying the guarantee deposit and to avoid family planning.

Fourth, the punishment for secret marriages is not strict enough. The civil affairs departments and relevant personnel wait for people to come to them to register, making it difficult to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. Additionally, some rural areas lack effective propaganda of laws and late marriage and late childbearing, leading to a weak sense of law-abiding among peasants, causing the problem to persist and spread.

After winter, it is again the peak season for rural youth marriages. We appeal to leaders at all levels and relevant departments to take immediate action, to start early to investigate this illegal phenomenon, to seriously implement the marriage registration system, to strictly control and leave no blind spots, and to make great efforts in legal and late marriage and family planning propaganda and education to fundamentally solve the problem.

### 私婚——一个严重的社会问题

    私婚
    ——一个严重的社会问题
    据我县一些乡村干部反映，目前农村青年早婚、私婚现象明显增多，已成为一个较严重的社会问题。我县天台山镇最近一次清查，就为38对已婚青年补办了结婚登记手续。一个千人小村就查出9对私婚者。造成这种现象的原因：
    一是一些农民传宗接代思想作祟，千方百计促使子女早成婚。有的甚至给子女定娃娃亲。婚姻法规定最低婚配年龄男22岁、女20岁，而现在的早婚者大多在17—20岁。由于年龄未到无法登记，便私自成婚。
    二是拐卖妇女，仓促成婚。据公安、妇女等有关部门反映，近年来拐卖妇女案件增多，全县有800多名外地妇女被拐骗与当地青年成婚。这些妇女几乎都没有户籍手续，无法登记，而男方娶妻心切，多数强迫成婚。这个问题在一些农村相当突出，成了私婚的一个死角。
    三是当事人逃避收费。近年来一些地方为了实行计划生育。规定在结婚登记时需交一定数额的计划生育保证金。婚后若按规定实行计划生育则予退还，否则没收保证金。目前一些农民计划生育自觉性不高，虽然不敢超生多生，但也不愿领取独生子女证。所以造成保证金有交无还。这种土政策，招致了农民的土对策，干脆不登记就成婚，以逃避交保证金，逃避计划生育。
    四是对私婚现象惩治不力。民政部门和有关人员坐等上门登记，难以及时发现和解决问题。加上一些农村宣传法律和晚婚晚育不力，农民遵法守法意识淡薄，造成问题长期存在和不断蔓延。
    入冬之后，又是农村青年结婚高峰，呼吁各级领导和有关部门立即行动起来，及早动手清查这种违法现象，认真落实结婚登记制度，严格把关、不留死角，并下大力气进行法律和晚婚计划生育的宣传教育工作，从根本上解决问题。
