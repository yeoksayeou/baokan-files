Recently, a few individuals traveling abroad have used improper methods to exchange foreign currency overseas, resulting in them being deceived and defrauded. This has led to counterfeit foreign currency entering Shanghai, causing losses to both the country and individuals.

An athlete from Shanghai who participated in an international competition returned home via Hong Kong, where he privately exchanged 400 US dollars on the black market. Upon arriving in Shanghai, he eagerly went to the Foreign Service Corporation for Overseas Chinese to purchase duty-free goods, handing over 9 notes of 100 US dollars. The staff carefully examined them and informed him that 4 of the notes were counterfeit. As a result, he did not purchase the goods but instead received a "China Bank Seizure of Counterfeit Currency Receipt." A student who studied in the Federal Republic of Germany accumulated 2000 West German Marks and privately exchanged them for 10,000 Hong Kong dollars in Hong Kong. He rejoiced in his perceived gain. However, upon arriving in Shanghai to purchase goods at the Foreign Service Corporation for Overseas Chinese, he was informed that 4 of the 500 Hong Kong dollar notes were counterfeit after being altered. This individual regretted his actions deeply.

According to incomplete statistics from the Shanghai branch of the China Foreign Service Corporation, in 1988, the company discovered 1320 US dollars and 4500 Hong Kong dollars in counterfeit currency during its operations. In the first half of 1989, they had already discovered 1000 US dollars in counterfeit currency.

Relevant departments urge overseas individuals to strictly adhere to discipline and not privately exchange foreign currency to avoid being deceived and defrauded.

### 私兑外汇　害国害己

    私兑外汇　害国害己
    近来，少数出国人员采取不正当手段在境外换取外汇，结果上当受骗，造成一些伪造外币流入上海，给国家和个人都造成了损失。
    上海一位出国比赛的运动员，回国途经香港时，私下在黑市场调换400美元。到上海后，他兴冲冲赶到出国人员服务公司，递上9张面额100元的美钞购买免税商品。工作人员仔细辨认后，明确告诉他其中4张是假钞，结果商品未买成，却收到一张“中国银行没收假钞收据”。一位赴联邦德国留学的人员，学成归来，经香港时，用自己积攒下来的2000元西德马克私下和港人兑换10000港元，按当时比价，他暗自庆幸自己赚到一笔。谁知，到了上海出国人员服务公司购买商品时，被告知其中4张500元票面的港币是经涂改后的假钞票，这位出国人员后悔莫及。
    据中国出国人员服务公司上海分公司的不完全统计，1988年该公司在经营业务中发现假美钞1320元，假港币4500元，1989年上半年已发现假美钞1000元。
    有关部门呼吁出国人员应严格遵守纪律，不要私自兑换外币，避免上当受骗。
