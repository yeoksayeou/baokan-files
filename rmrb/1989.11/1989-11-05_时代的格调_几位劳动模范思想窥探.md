At the National Labor Model Conference, I had the opportunity to converse with three labor models of different age groups. I discovered that their emotional expressions varied: those in their 60s were the most easily moved and had the most tears; those in their 40s were next; and the young people in their 20s seemed to have no tears at all. What is their inner world really like?

(One)

First, let's talk about Zhang Chengzhe, a master craftsman from the Casting Factory in Shenyang. He has been honored with the title of National Labor Model twice and has received over 40 awards. He was also selected as a delegate to the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

He only attended two years of primary school. Over the past 30 years, he has made over 500 technological innovations, 60 of which are major innovations, and 12 of which have filled gaps in the country's technology. He has also solved over 100 production technology problems for other enterprises without compensation.

He is a "reformer," known as "Zhang Half-Night." It is common for him to work until midnight at the factory. He went to Anshan Steel to learn and helped them reform the casting machine. He stayed in a guesthouse for a meeting and helped someone create a dishwasher. He was walking down the street and heard someone say they couldn't produce fertilizer without a mixer, and a few weeks later, that factory got a mixer and an automatic production line. Even during the Cultural Revolution, he made 14 innovations.

He is the "King of Junk." Every morning, he walks around the factory grounds, and on his days off, he digs through scrap iron piles. When he travels out of town, he often brings back several dozen pounds of scrap. His treasure trove contains over 60 tons of discarded parts, which he uses in his innovations, turning waste into treasure.

Zhang Chengzhe's two daughters work in enterprises that are losing money and can't pay wages. One of his sons quit his job to start a private business but didn't succeed. His family's TV and washing machine are awards he received. They still don't have a refrigerator. His wardrobe was made by himself over 20 years ago. However, Zhang Chengzhe has five technology consultant contracts, each earning him 500 yuan per month. Zhang Chengzhe, considering himself a party member, does not take this second income. Some enterprises offered him a high salary to consult, but he declined, saying he would only provide ideas and not do the work.

Old Master Zhang told me excitedly, "I know some people don't understand me. Once, I pushed an old axle on my bicycle, and a girl said, 'You're Zhang Chengzhe, the National Labor Model, and you're still using these old things.' A young man said, 'It's the 1980s now, why are you still using these old things to innovate? Even old models should keep up with the times!' My family is divided into two factions. My eldest daughter and her husband are both labor models, and we can understand each other. In the past, people saw me working late at night to help other factories with technological reforms and thought I must have some ulterior motive. But after an investigation, they found no wrongdoing but a lot of good deeds. Over time, people understood. But why am I working so hard? Some reporters always ask me this. I say it's because of my deep feelings for the Party and socialism. Some people don't believe it. But it's really true. When I was 9, my father died, and at 11, I worked for the Japanese. Once, I went down the mountain to buy tofu brain, and on the way back, I slipped and fell, spilling the tofu brain but holding onto the bowl tightly, saying, 'I can't afford to replace it.' The Japanese gave me two slaps. After that, I was afraid of officials, my legs would shake, and my heart would race. My mother and grandmother were at their wits' end. But then liberation came, and what a feeling that was. In 1950, at 17, I entered the factory and then self-studied junior and senior high school courses. Some old workers patted my shoulder and said, 'Our country is liberated, but the casting workers are not (referring to the labor intensity and working environment).' I became a reformer, and sometimes I would knock on the door at midnight and fall asleep outside. Now, when I talk about these things, my children say it's all in the past, why bring it up? But I've been through it, my experiences and feelings are connected to the past. I won't hide it from you, I'm still secretly studying Chairman Mao's works, 'On Practice,' and 'On Contradiction.' I like it, it's also a matter of feelings, I can't help it."

Master Zhang's voice trembled, and his eyes welled up with tears several times...

(Two)

The Republic's contemporaries, what are the ideals and beliefs of middle-aged labor models like?

Yang Tieyan from Shenyang Factory 139 entered the factory in 1965. He has been a labor model for over a decade. He said, "When I entered the factory, I set the goal of building socialism and communism. Especially after joining the Party, my beliefs have not changed. Others say you won't see communism in your lifetime, but if a person has no beliefs, what's the point of living? When I give lectures, some young people laugh and say, 'You're sick, how can you still have these ideas in the 1980s?' I get very angry. If achieving the Four Modernizations and revitalizing China is laughable, then our country is doomed!"

Chen Xijun is a technician from Dalian Electric Motor Factory. He has been awarded the National May 1st Labor Medal twice. He has made over 150 technological innovations, seven of which are leading in the domestic industry, and one of which is at the world's advanced level. This time, he came to Beijing for the labor model conference and brought with him a manuscript of over 10,000 words titled "Initial Plan for Improving Y Series Motors," which includes 100 specific measures.

Seeing the reporter, he spoke passionately. "The motors we produce are still designed from the 1950s, unchanged for decades. The Japanese update every five years, can't we? It's not that we can't, it's that we don't! I proposed these 100 measures, and with just a few million yuan, we can save hundreds of millions. There are many things that are very easy to change. Westerners learn from the Chinese how to eat chicken, saying the Chinese don't throw away the chicken head, claws, and innards. But we waste too much in the production field. Our products are technologically backward, of poor quality, and sold at low prices. Isn't this the biggest waste? If our leaders, technicians, and workers work together to innovate, there's nothing we can't achieve. I'm just stubborn, things that others say can't be done, I make them happen. Because I'm not doing it for anyone, I'm doing it for the country and the enterprise. I've done so many projects, and I estimate that I've saved the country over a thousand million yuan, but the organization only gave me a thousand or two thousand yuan. I value the cause more, what feeling is there in those successes?"

"Chinese people are not incapable, we just don't do it!" This fair-skinned, gentle middle-aged man's eyes also welled up with tears as he repeated this sentence over and over.

Wang Lize, 26, is the manager of the Peace Chemical Shop of Shenyang Chemical Materials Company. He started as a salesman at 16 and has been a "veteran" labor model for nine consecutive years.

The introduction to him reads: "Selfless, honest, and upright, he has rejected 15,000 yuan in commissions and kickbacks, declined 140 invitations to dinners, and refused 92 gifts. Six or seven units have offered him high salaries to be the manager, but he has declined them all. He has helped 33 factories develop production, provided information, and achieved good economic benefits. Over the years, he has volunteered many days of labor, and even though his sales volume is high, he only takes the average bonus from the enterprise. Usually, he is busy with work and rarely spends holidays with his parents. He returned from a business trip the day before his wedding."

Young labor model Wang Lize said: "I have been a salesman for five years and a deputy manager for three years, and now I am the manager. When I was a salesman, I alone completed 50% of the profit for my unit. Now, many enterprises offer me a three-room apartment and other benefits to join them, but I haven't gone. I can't leave the enterprise and the people. Our company has many young people, and everyone gets along well. I understand young people and try not to punish them by deducting their bonuses. If they make a mistake, just point it out and guide them."

"I do sales, relying on sincerity to solve users' production needs and provide quality service."

"As a salesman, 'standing by the river, how can you not get your feet wet'?" I asked.

The young manager stared at me with bright eyes, somewhat displeased, and said: "If one's life is just for money, I could be a millionaire. I feel that using my knowledge and abilities to serve the enterprise, even if I personally pay some effort, I feel fulfilled. When I first started working, I decided to work hard, especially after joining the Party, I firmly established the ideal of struggling for the motherland and the Four Modernizations. But ideals are not castles in the air, they are closely connected to everyone's job. Some young people don't want to start from small, ordinary tasks, and end up achieving nothing."

The young man spoke lightly and happily. In the vast sea of commodity economy, he seemed to have already become accustomed to it...

The stories of the three generations of labor models have been told. I feel that being a labor model is a "hard job," but it also has its joys. Imagine when Zhang Chengzhe finally designed the automatic core card machine after drawing hundreds of diagrams, improving work efficiency by 15 times, and people looked at him with amazement, he must have felt very satisfied! Heaven, I did something that others thought I couldn't do! It is in this continuous creation that he feels his existence value being recognized by society.

Chen Xijun said: "Why do I feel happier the more I suffer for innovation? I feel I have fulfilled my responsibility. The bed I changed 20 years ago is still the best in the country, and I feel proud."

Young manager Wang Lize, as a young person, is valued by so many people and enterprises. Isn't this a kind of super "enjoyment"?

It seems that labor models give their physical and mental effort and gain a sublime ideal and the realization of life value.

In our time, these are people of "high taste."

    时代的格调
    ——几位劳动模范思想窥探
    晓阳
    全国劳模会上，与三个不同年龄层次的劳模攀谈，发现了他们不同的感情表达方式：60岁左右的人最易激动，眼泪也最多；40岁左右的人次之；20多岁的青年则与眼泪无缘了。他们的内心世界究竟是怎样的呢？
    （一）
    先说说沈阳市铸造厂的张成哲老师傅，他连续两次荣获全国劳模的光荣称号，拥有各类奖章40多块，还被选为党的十三大代表。
    他只上过二年小学，30多年来他搞技术革新500多项，重大革新60项，有12项填补了国家空白，无偿为其它企业解决生产技术难题100多项。
    他是革新迷，外号“张半夜”，在厂工作到半夜是常事。他去鞍钢学习，帮人家改革了铸管机；他开会住进招待所，帮人搞成了洗碗机；他走在路上，听前边人说没搅拌机化肥无法生产，几星期后那个厂从“半路捡来”了搅拌机和一条自动生产线。就是在“文革”之中，他还搞成14项革新。
    他是“破烂王”，每天早晨到厂区各角落转转，公休日到废铁堆扒啦扒啦，到外地出差也常扛着几十斤重的废品回来。他的万宝库中有60多吨废弃零部件，一搞起革新来，许多被派上用场，变废为宝了。
    张成哲的两个女儿所在企业亏损开不出工资，一个儿子辞职搞个体，也没干出什么名堂。他家的彩电、洗衣机是得的奖品，电冰箱至今未买。衣柜是自己20多年前打的。可张成哲手里有5张技术顾问的聘书，按合同每月可以拿到500元钱，张成哲考虑自己是党员，不应拿这第二份钱。有的企业出高薪聘他，而且讲明只出主意不干活，他谢绝了。
    老张师傅很激动地对我说，我知道有些人对我不理解。一次，我用自行车推了根旧轴，一个姑娘看了说，你就是张成哲呀，还是全国劳模呢，真能弄景。一个小伙子说，现在都80年代了，你还用这些破烂搞什么革新，老模范也得跟上时代步伐！我的家里也分两“派”，我大女儿大女婿都是劳模，咱们能互相理解。前些年，人们见我三更半夜地帮别的厂搞技改，断定我不可能没一点图头，结果一调查，没查出坏事，倒查出一堆好事来。时间长了，大家也明白了。可到底为什么这么拚命干呢，一些记者也老是抠根问底，我说是对党和社会主义的深厚感情。有的人不以为然。其实还真就是这么回事。我9岁父亲去世，11岁给日本人干活，一次我下山去买豆腐脑，上山路滑，我滚了好几个个儿，豆腐脑洒了，却死死抱住碗，俺赔不起呀。为此，日本人给了我两个耳光。打那以后，我一见当官的，腿发软，心发抖，我和母亲奶奶眼看走投无路了。解放了，那是什么心情。1950年我17岁进厂，接着就自学了初高中课程。一些老工人拍着我的肩膀说，咱们国家解放了，可铸造工人还没解放啊（指劳动强度和工作环境）。我成了革新迷，半夜回家敲不开门，蹲门口睡着了。我现在讲这些，儿女们都说是过去的事了，提它干嘛？可我是过来的人，我的经历，我的感情与过去是连在一起的。不瞒你说，我现在还在暗暗地学毛主席著作，实践论，矛盾论。我喜欢，这也是感情，没办法。
    老师傅声音发抖，几次热泪盈眶……
    （二）
    共和国的同龄人，中年劳模们的理想、信念又是怎样形成的呢？
    沈阳139厂的杨铁岩是1965年入厂的工人。他也当了十几年的各种劳模了。他说，我进厂就树立了干社会主义想共产主义的远大理想，尤其入党后形成的信念改不了。别人都说共产主义你是看不见了，可人要是没信念活着还有什么意思。我讲课时，有的小青年听了发笑，你是有病怎么地，现在还抱着这套想法？我很生气，如果认为实现四化振兴中华可笑，咱国家不就完了吗？！
    陈希俊是大连电机厂的技术人员，他曾连续两次荣获全国“五·一”劳动奖章。他搞技术革新150多项，有七项在国内同行业领先，一项世界先进水平。这次来京开劳模会，他特意带着自己用钢笔写的几万字材料《改进Y系列电机初步方案》，文中提了100条具体措施。
    见到记者，他讲得很激动。“我们产的电机还是50年代设计的，几十年一贯制了。日本人5年一更新，我们不能吗？不是不能，是不干！我提这100条方案，只需投几十万元，就可节省几百万元。这其中有很多是很容易改的。西方人向中国人学习吃鸡，说中国人连鸡头鸡爪鸡内脏都不扔。可咱们在生产领域里浪费太惊人了。咱们的产品技术落后，质量差，卖低价，这不是最大的浪费吗？咱要是领导、技术人员和工人拧成一股绳搞革新，没个不成的。我这个人就是倔，别人都说不成的事我非让它成。因为我不是给哪个人干的，是给国家给企业干的。我干了那么多项目，估计可给国家节省上千万元，组织上也就给我一二千元钱。我更看重事业，那一次次的成功心里什么滋味？”
    “中国人不是不行，就怕不干！”这个白晰文静的中年人眼里也含着泪花，反复重复着这句话。
    （三）
    26岁的王利哲是沈阳化工原料公司和平化工商店的经理。他16岁当推销员，是连续9年的“老”劳模了。
    有关介绍他的材料上这样写着：为公忘私，廉洁正派，谢绝提成好处费15000元，拒绝宴请140次，拒收礼品92次。有六七个单位以高薪请他当厂长，他都一一谢绝。他帮助33个厂家发展生产，提供信息，取得好的经济效益。几年来，他义务献工多天，销售额高也只拿企业的平均奖。平时工作忙，很少跟父母亲人一起度过团圆佳节，结婚的前一天才从外地回来。
    小“老”劳模王利哲说：“我当了5年业务员，3年副经理，现在是经理。当业务员时我一个人完成的利润额占我单位的50％，现有许多企业以三室一厅住房等优惠条件请我去，我都没去。我离不开企业和人。我们公司小青年多，大家感情融洽。我理解年青人，尽量不以扣奖的办法惩罚人，他有错误你给点出来，引导一下就可以了。”
    “我干销售，靠真诚为用户解决生产急需和优质服务。”
    “作为业务员，‘常在河边站，怎能不湿鞋’？”我问。
    小经理两眼炯炯地瞪着我，有些不快地说：“如果人生一世就为了钱，我可以当几位数字的万元户。我觉得能用自己的知识和本事为企业服务，我个人付出点辛苦，心里充实。我刚参加工作时，就下了决心，一定要好好干，特别是入党后，又坚定了为祖国为四化奋斗的理想。但理想不是空中楼阁，他与每个人的本职工作紧密相连，有些青年不愿从平凡的岗位一点一滴的小事做起，结果一事无成。”
    小伙子讲得轻松愉快，他在商品经济的大海里，似乎已经游惯了……
    三代劳模的故事讲完了，我感到当劳模是个“苦差事”，同时又有着他们的乐趣。试想当张成哲画了几百张图终于设计成功了自动芯卡机，提高工效15倍，人们以惊异的目光看着这位只上过二年小学的工人时，他心里该何等惬意！天哪，我干成了一件人家认为我干不成的事！正是在这种不断创造中他感受到了自己的存在价值被社会承认的喜悦。
    陈希俊说：“我搞革新为什么越吃苦心越甜？我觉得自己尽到了责任。我20年前改的床子，现在还是全国一流的，我感到自豪。”
    小经理王利哲，作为一个青年人，能被那么多人那么多企业看中，这不是一种超级“享受”吗？
    看来，劳模们奉献的是体力、精力，获取的是崇高理想、人生价值的实现。
    在我们时代，这是些“高格调”的人。
