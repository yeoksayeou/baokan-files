In a situation where state-planned materials are decreasing year by year, the material departments in Harbin City have fully utilized their "reservoir" role. They have adopted a policy of balancing supply and demand, prioritizing key areas, and ensuring that limited materials are used where they are most needed. This has effectively guaranteed the production of key industries and the completion of key construction projects.

The Harbin City Material Bureau has vigorously developed resources, expanded the market, and properly arranged the supply of production and living materials for the entire city. At the same time, they have focused on truly prioritizing key needs and formulated supply policies and measures to support the best and limit the worst. In cases where planned material orders and deliveries are insufficient, the bureau has broken away from the old framework of "base number level allocation." They ensure that key projects receive priority in material allocation, and if planned materials cannot meet the demand, they have the demand side submit a list, and they will "prescribe the medicine" within the province and outside, ensuring the supply.

To eliminate the worries of material procurement for key projects, the Harbin City material departments have reformed the supply methods and implemented a contract-based supply system. First, they prioritize the allocation of material supply plans for contracted supply key projects. The Harbin City Material Bureau allocates a large amount of low-price subsidies from resource development to key projects every year. Second, they prioritize orders at material procurement meetings, ensuring the order level and delivery dates. Third, they prioritize daily supplies. Through scheduling, adjustment, on-site service, and door-to-door delivery, they strive to solve the problems of shortage, scarcity, urgency, and difficulty for key projects. Over the past year, the Harbin City steel market alone has delivered materials to the doorsteps of key projects 1,500 times, delivering steel worth 23 million yuan, and procuring nearly 40,000 tons of short-line steel from outside the province for key projects.

While ensuring that the "fast cows" are well-fed, the Harbin City material departments also rationally reduce the supply for "slow cows" based on actual needs: they allocate less or no planned materials for general products; they do not arrange supplies for restricted production products and high-energy-consuming electrical products; and they firmly stop supplying materials for cleared construction projects and outdated products.

    物资部门发挥“蓄水池”作用
    哈尔滨市确保重点生产项目
    据新华社哈尔滨11月6日电　（记者蒋耀波、通讯员宫喜庆）在国家计划物资逐年减少的情况下，哈尔滨市物资部门充分发挥“蓄水池”作用，采取有保有压、有取有舍的重点倾斜政策，把有限的物资用到最需要的地方，有效地保证了重点产业的生产和重点建设项目的完成。
    哈尔滨市物资局在大力开发资源、开拓市场、妥善安排好全市生产生活物资需求的同时，将重点需要真正做为重点来抓，并制订了保优限劣的供应政策和措施。在计划内物资订货到货不足的情况下，这个局在计划分配上打破了过去“基数值水平法”分配的老框子，做到重点项目重点保，指令性物资不能满足需要则由需方提出货单，他们在省内外“照单抓药”，保证供应。
    为了解除重点项目物资采购上的后顾之忧，哈尔滨市物资部门改革供应办法，实行重点承包配套供应。一是对承包供应的重点项目优先安排物资分配计划。哈尔滨市物资局每年都拿出大量开发资源低价补助重点项目。二是物资订货会上优先订，从订货水平和到货日期上给予保证。三是日常供应优先供。通过调度调剂、现场服务、送货上门等尽量解决重点项目的短、少、急、难问题。去年以来，仅哈尔滨市钢材市场就为全市重点需要送货上门1500人次，送钢材价值 2300万元，从省外为重点项目代购短线钢材近4万吨。
    哈尔滨市物资部门在坚持为“快牛”加料的同时，还根据实际给“慢牛”减草：对一般性产品生产少分配或不分配计划内物资；对限制生产的产品、超前消费的高耗机电产品不安排供应；对已经清理的在建项目、落后淘汰产品生产坚决停供物资。
