For scientists around the world, the past week has been extraordinarily significant. According to the decision of the 43rd United Nations General Assembly, the week of November 11 each year is designated as "Science and Peace Week." Facing this major issue, what are Chinese scientists thinking? On November 8, the China Association for Peace and Disarmament and the China Association for Science and Technology held a "Scientists Discuss Peace" seminar at the Beijing Science Hall. More than ten Chinese scientists expressed their views at the meeting.

Science and Technology Should Not Harm Humanity

Although most people in the world hope for peace, it has not yet been achieved globally. Looking back at world history, conflicts, turmoil, and wars have occupied more time than peace, stability, and progress. Having just returned from a visit to Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, pediatric leukemia expert Hu Yamei has a deep understanding of the harm caused by modern warfare. She said, "In Hiroshima and Nagasaki, I visited exhibitions reflecting the situation after the atomic bomb explosions, which was truly horrifying. As a doctor, my duty is to treat and save people, but when we doctors are doing our best to rescue patients, war is harming humanity."

The relationship between science and peace is one of unity and contradiction. Chinese scientists are clearly aware that science can both promote peace and threaten it. Scientific and technological achievements can be used to develop social production and benefit humanity, but they can also be used for military purposes and harm humanity. In today's world, on one hand, technological progress is rapidly changing human life and creating enormous wealth; on the other hand, the arms race has not stopped, and the existence of large-scale destructive weapons is seriously threatening world peace.

Obviously, when Chinese scientists call for peace, they have not forgotten this grim fact: in wars that harm humanity, science still plays an important role. In fact, modern warfare has become a war of science and technology.

Science itself is neutral; it is the application of science that determines whether it is beneficial or harmful. The key to peace is in the hands of humanity. Liu Shu, Secretary of the China Association for Science and Technology, said, "As science and technology workers, we clearly understand the destructive power of new-generation nuclear weapons. We have the responsibility to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war." The scientists participating in the seminar pointed out that scientific and technological achievements are the common wealth of humanity and should be used for economic and social development, not for aggression, expansion, and the arms race.

Peace is a Prerequisite for Development

The contemporary world faces two major themes: peace and development. Peace is a prerequisite for development, and development should promote peace. In fact, the prosperity of any country, the flourishing of any nation, and the economic prosperity of any country cannot be separated from a peaceful environment and technological progress.

Chinese scientists believe: the issue of peace cannot be viewed in isolation; peace must be linked to reality. Lu Zuyin, a researcher at the Institute of High Energy Physics who participated in nuclear tests, said, "Most of us have experienced the hardships of the war-torn pre-liberation period. We have a deep understanding of war and yearn for peace. However, peace is not easily obtained; peace must be fought for. To oppose war, we must also have the strength to defend our peaceful living environment."

Scientific development requires a peaceful environment, and scientific development should also be for maintaining a peaceful environment. In his address to the seminar, Cai Zemin, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Peace and Disarmament, recalled that in the 40 years since the founding of New China, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, our country has undergone tremendous changes. Great achievements have been made in the development of science and technology, which have attracted worldwide attention. Practice has proven that a strong China will be beneficial to the maintenance of world peace.

The reporter noted that the scientists who spoke almost unanimously emphasized: the Chinese people, who are committed to reform and opening up and are building socialist modernization, highly value having a relatively long period of peaceful international environment. They call for Chinese scientists to shoulder the responsibility of revitalizing the nation and make greater contributions to the cause of world peace and human progress.

    中国需要和平的国际环境
    ——“科学家谈和平”座谈会侧记
    本报记者　丁刚
    对于全世界的科学家来说，正在过去的这个星期具有非同寻常的意义。根据联合国第43届大会决定，每年11月11日所属的一周为“科学与和平周”。科学与和平，面对这一重大课题，中国的科学家们又是怎样想的呢？11月8日，中国人民争取和平与裁军协会和中国科学技术协会在北京科学会堂召开了“科学家谈和平”座谈会，十多位中国科学家代表在会上发表了他们的看法。
    科技成果不应危害人类
    尽管世界上绝大多数人都期望和平，但和平仍未在全世界实现。回顾世界历史，冲突、动乱和战争要比和平、安定和进步占用的时间多。对于现代战争的危害，刚刚访问了日本长崎、广岛归来的儿童白血病专家胡亚美深有体会。她说：“在广岛和长崎，我参观了反映原子弹爆炸后情况的展览，真是惨不忍睹。我是一个医生，医生的职责是治病救人，但是，当我们医生在千方百计地抢救患者时，战争却在危害着人类。”
    科学与和平的关系是对立统一的。中国的科学家们清醒地认识到，科学既能促进和平，也能威胁和平。科学技术的成果既可以用于发展社会生产，造福人类，也可以用于军事目的，危害人类。当今世界，一方面，科技进步正在迅速地改变着人类的生活，创造着巨大财富；另一方面，军备竞赛仍然没有停止，大规模毁灭性武器的存在正严重威胁着世界和平。
    显然，中国科学家们在呼唤和平的时候并没有忘记这样一个严峻的事实：在危害人类的战争中，科学仍然在扮演着重要的角色。实际上，现代战争已经成为科学技术的战争。
    科学本身没有善恶之分，只有对科学的运用才会产生善恶。和平的钥匙就握在人类手中。中国科协书记处书记刘恕说，作为科技工作者，我们清楚地了解新一代核武器的毁灭能力，我们有责任防止核战争的爆发。参加座谈会的科学家们指出，科学技术成果是人类的共同财富，应该被用于经济与社会的发展，而绝不应为侵略扩张和军备竞赛服务。
    和平是发展的前提
    当代世界面临着和平与发展两大主题。和平是发展的前提，发展应促进和平。实际上，任何国家的富强，民族的昌盛，经济的繁荣都离不开和平的环境和科技的进步。
    中国科学家们认为：不能孤立地看待和平问题，讲和平必须要与现实相联系。曾经参加过核试验的高能物理研究所研究员陆祖荫说：“我们这一代人大都经历过解放前颠沛流离的战争时期的生活，对战争有着深刻的体会，我们渴望和平。但是，和平并不是唾手可得，和平是要争取的，要反对战争，也要有保卫和平生存环境的实力。”
    科学发展需要一个和平环境，科学发展也应该为了维护和平环境。中国人民争取和平与裁军协会副会长柴泽民在给座谈会的致词中回顾说，新中国成立40年来，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，我国发生了天翻地覆的变化。科学技术的发展取得了举世瞩目伟大成就。实践证明，一个国力强大的中国将有益于维护世界和平。
    记者注意到，发言的科学家们几乎无一例外地强调：正在坚持改革开放和进行社会主义现代化建设的中国人民，十分珍惜有一个较长时期的和平的国际环境。他们呼吁，中国的科学家们应当担负起振兴中华的重任，为维护世界和平和人类进步事业作出更大的贡献。
