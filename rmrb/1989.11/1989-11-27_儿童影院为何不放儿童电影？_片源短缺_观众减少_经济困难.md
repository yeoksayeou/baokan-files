Recently, the reporter took her daughter to the Dalian Children's Theater to watch a movie. Under the title "Deadline Approaching," the words "Not Suitable for Children" were prominently displayed, so the reporter had to leave with her daughter in disappointment.

The reporter flipped through the past two months of the "Dalian Daily" and found that out of the more than 30 films shown at this theater, not a single one was a children's film.

Why doesn't the Children's Theater screen children's films? The manager of the Dalian Children's Theater, Li, told the reporter about the "three difficulties": First, it's difficult to secure film sources. This year, the Dalian Children's Theater screened over 100 films, but only two or three were children's films. Second, it's difficult to organize audiences. Due to the impact of television, fewer and fewer children come to the theater to watch movies. Schools, with their tight schedules, rarely organize students to watch films. The Dalian Children's Theater performs student screenings at most two or three times a month. Third, it's difficult to meet economic targets. The Dalian Children's Theater has a contract with the municipal film company, requiring them to net a profit of 85,000 yuan annually, as well as to cover bonuses for 30 employees and over 100,000 yuan for theater maintenance. If they rely solely on a few children's films each month, they won't even be able to afford meals, let alone bonuses.

According to some film projection and distribution workers, the situation of children's theaters not showing children's films is not unique to Dalian; most children's theaters across the country are the same. They believe that the state should address the issue of children's film shortages from the film management system, providing children with more abundant spiritual nourishment.

　　儿童影院为何不放儿童电影？
　　片源短缺　观众减少　经济困难
    据新华社大连11月26日电　（记者李小林）前不久，记者领女儿到大连儿童影院看电影，在《死期临近》的片名下，赫然写着“儿童不宜”四个字，于是，只得领女儿悻悻而归。
    记者随手翻阅了近两个月的《大连报》，发现这家影院上映的30多部影片，竟无1部儿童片。
    儿童影院为何不上映儿童片？大连儿童影院李经理向记者诉说起“三难”：一是片源难保证。今年大连儿童影院上映了100多部影片，儿童片只有二、三部。二是观众难组织。由于电视的冲击，来影院看电影的儿童越来越少。学校因课程排得很紧，也很少组织学生看电影。大连儿童影院每月至多不过演二、三场学生专场。三是经济指标难负担。大连儿童影院与市电影公司签定了承包责任制，每年需净上缴利润8.5万元，还要解决30名职工的奖金和10多万元的影院维修等费用，如果只靠每月那么几场儿童片，不要说奖金，职工连饭都吃不上。
    据一些电影放映发行工作者反映，儿童影院不演儿童片的情况不只大连有，全国多数儿童影院都是如此。他们认为，国家要从电影管理体制入手，解决儿童片短缺的问题，多为儿童提供丰富的精神食粮。
