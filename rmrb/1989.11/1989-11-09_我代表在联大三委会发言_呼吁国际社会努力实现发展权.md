China's representative, Wu Shanshui, spoke today at the Third Committee of the 44th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on the issue of the right to development. He called on the international community to unite and realize the principles outlined in the Declaration on the Right to Development.

In December 1986, the 41st UNGA adopted the Declaration on the Right to Development, which clearly states that the right to development is an inalienable human right and a collective right of a nation or people. The declaration also explicitly requires the elimination of major obstacles to the development of peoples, such as large-scale human rights violations caused by racism, colonialism, foreign aggression, and occupation, as well as the old, unreasonable international economic order. Wu Shanshui pointed out that the declaration reflects the international community's new understanding and demands regarding the protection of human rights, and it aligns with the political will to strengthen international solidarity and cooperation to promote social progress and development.

Wu Shanshui believes that implementing the Declaration on the Right to Development is a complex and arduous task, which can be approached from three aspects: 1) widely publicizing the content and significance of the declaration; 2) conducting in-depth research on the issue of implementing the right to development; 3) coordinating the efforts of UN member states and all relevant parties.

    我代表在联大三委会发言
    呼吁国际社会努力实现发展权
    本报联合国11月7日电  记者刘开宸报道：中国代表武善秀今天在第44届联大三委会审议发展权问题时发言，呼吁国际社会团结一致，实现发展权宣言所规定的原则。
    1986年12月，第41届联大通过了《发展权宣言》，明确发展权是一项不可剥夺的人权，也是一项国家或民族的集体权利。宣言还明确要求消除阻碍各国人民发展的主要障碍，即由种族主义、殖民主义、外国侵略和占领等造成的大规模侵犯人权以及旧的不合理的国际经济秩序。武善秀指出，宣言反映了国际社会对保护人权问题新的理解和要求，适应了为促进社会进步与发展而加强国际团结、合作的政治愿望。
    武善秀认为，实施《发展权宣言》是一项复杂、艰巨的任务，可从三方面着手：1、广泛宣传宣言的内容和意义；2、加强对实施发展权问题的深入研究；3、协调联合国成员国及一切有关方面的努力。
