The Ministry of Commerce's Vice Minister He Jihai stated at the national grain work conference held today that this year's grain and oil purchase and sales situation is good, with increased procurement and decreased sales, and the market is stable. However, the task of completing the contracted procurement of grain into the warehouse in the coming period remains arduous, and there are still some difficulties in market arrangements. The Ministry of Commerce requires local authorities to correctly analyze the grain situation, take practical and effective measures, and effectively arrange the market.

	Data compiled by various regions show that this year's grain production situation is generally better than in previous years. It is estimated that the national grain output will increase by more than 5 billion kilograms compared to last year. The total oilseed production for the year may decrease by one-tenth compared to last year. By November 20, the national contracted procurement task for grain had completed 78.6% of the annual plan, which is 9 billion kilograms more than the same period last year; the procurement of negotiated-priced grain increased by 2.7 billion kilograms compared to the same period last year; the procurement of price-controlled edible oil increased by 60 million kilograms compared to the same period last year. While procurement has increased, in the first 10 months of this year, various regions have plugged loopholes and reduced the sales volume. By the end of October, the national sales of price-controlled grain and negotiated-priced grain decreased by 6.5 billion kilograms and 6 billion kilograms respectively compared to the same period last year, with 4.2 billion kilograms of price-controlled and negotiated-priced edible oil sold each. However, this year's grain production increase compared to last year is still of a recovery nature; the commercial grain production areas such as Northeast China have seen significant reductions, which have a relatively large impact on the national grain balance. The progress of contracted procurement of grain into the warehouse is relatively fast, mainly due to the good harvests in the southern and northwestern regions. The progress of procurement in the later period mainly depends on the disaster-stricken areas. In addition, some regions lack funds for the procurement of negotiated-priced grain, and their storage capacity is insufficient, so there are still many difficulties.

	To alleviate the difficulties in grain and oil purchase and sales, He Jihai requires local authorities to actively raise funds, focus on the procurement of price-controlled and negotiated-priced grain and oil, strictly control grain sales, effectively arrange the allocation and adjustment of rice, and ensure the living conditions of the people in disaster-stricken areas. He Jihai said that from the recent grain procurement situation, the output is higher than originally estimated. Local authorities should seize the opportunity and strive to procure as much as possible. Areas with good harvests and light disasters must ensure the completion of contracted procurement and negotiated-priced grain procurement tasks; heavily disaster-stricken areas should procure as much as possible and cannot rely on reducing procurement and increasing sales or increasing imports to solve difficulties. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the management of grain supply, improve the rules and regulations through inspections and rectifications of grain supply, and reduce unreasonable consumption.

	Regarding the issue of inter-provincial allocation and adjustment of rice due to insufficient funds and other reasons, despite the general good harvest in the south, He Jihai said that effective allocation and adjustment of rice involves protecting farmers' production enthusiasm. Both production and sales sides must consider the overall situation and support each other. Sales areas should understand the difficulties of production areas and insist on accepting according to the plan without arbitrarily refusing; production areas should ensure quality and reasonably set prices.

### 商业部要求各地　切实搞好市场安排　缓解粮油购销困难

　　切实搞好市场安排
　　缓解粮油购销困难
    本报北京11月28日讯　新华社记者陈芸、本报记者潘岗报道：商业部副部长何济海在今天召开的全国粮食工作会议上说，今年粮油购销情况良好，收购增加，销售减少，市场稳定，但今后一段合同定购粮入库任务仍很艰巨，市场安排还有一定难度。商业部要求各地正确分析粮食形势，采取切实有效措施，搞好市场安排。
    各地汇总的数字表明，今年粮食生产形势总的来看好于往年，预计全国粮食总产将比去年增加50亿公斤以上，油料全年总产量可能比去年减产一成。截至11月20日，全国粮食合同定购任务已完成年度计划的78.6％，比上年同期多入库9亿多公斤；议价粮收购比上年同期增加27亿公斤；平价食油收购比上年同期增加6000万公斤。在收购增加的同时，今年前10个月，各地通过堵塞漏洞，压缩了销售量。10月末，全国平价粮、议价粮销售分别比去年同期减少6.5亿公斤和60亿公斤，平议价食油各销4.2亿公斤。但是，今年粮食比去年的增产仍属于恢复性质；东北等商品粮集中产区减产较多，对全国粮食平衡影响较大。粮食合同定购入库进度较快，主要是南方、西北地区丰收，后一段入库进度主要取决于受灾地区，再加上有些地区议价粮收购资金缺乏，仓储能力不足，困难仍不少。
    为缓解粮油购销困难，何济海要求各地积极筹措资金，切实抓紧平价和议价粮油收购工作，严格控制粮食销售，搞好大米的调拨和调剂，切实安排好灾区人民生活。何济海说，从最近粮食收打情况看，产量比原来预计上升，各地要抓住时机，千方百计力争多购一些。丰收和轻灾地区，必须保证完成合同定购和议价粮收购任务；重灾地区要尽量多购一些，不能靠减购增销、增加调入解决困难。同时，要加强对粮食供应的管理，通过检查整顿粮食供应，进一步健全规章制度，把不合理的消费压下来。
    谈到今年南方稻谷普遍丰收，但由于资金不足等原因省际间调拨、调剂不畅问题时何济海说，搞好大米的调拨和调剂，涉及保护农民生产积极性问题，产销双方一定要顾全大局，互相支援。销区要体谅产区的困难，坚持按计划接收，不能随意拒收；产区要保证质量，合理定价。
