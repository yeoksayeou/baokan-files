People live on this earth and cannot do without a suitable environment. Due to the development of modernization, pollution poses a strong challenge to the environment: if pollution is not addressed, the environment will be eroded, bringing only pain and disaster to people. For the health of the people and for the development of production, the work of utilizing, protecting, and improving the environment in our country is not a question of whether to do it or not, but a question of how to do it.

From the pollution problems reflected by readers, some have existed for many years, while others have just occurred; some have attracted attention, while others remain neglected, but the result is the same: pollution persists, and the affected masses are distressed. Is it true that the local governments are really helpless in the face of pollution problems? No. The key lies in resolve.

	14:09 03-5-27 “Focusing on the economy can increase social wealth, but focusing on environmental protection does not yield results.”
	“Addressing pollution costs too much; we can’t afford it.”
	“Polluting enterprises are economic powerhouses; we can’t afford to offend them.”

These short-sighted views, purely economic perspectives, and reluctance to face difficulties are all affecting the resolve to address pollution.

To resolve to address pollution is, in fact, to resolve to benefit the people. Where should the resolve be placed? First, in understanding the interdependent relationship between humans and the environment; second, in implementing specific measures. Currently, specific actions should be taken to prevent and address pollution. For places and units that discharge pollution, a deadline should be set for rectification; for enterprises that cause significant pollution, they should be ordered to halt production.

The work of environmental protection departments is very important and requires support from all sectors of society, especially from the leadership, which should back the environmental protection departments, ensuring that they can carry out their duties without any interference.

### 治理污染在决心

    治理污染在决心
    人们在大地上生息，离不开适宜的环境。由于现代化建设的发展，污染向环境提出强烈的挑战：污染不治理，环境就要受到侵蚀，给人们带来的只能是痛苦和灾难。为了人们的健康，为了生产的发展，利用环境、保护环境、改善环境的工作在我国不是要不要做的问题，而是必须做和怎样做的问题。
    从读者反映的污染问题看，有的已存在多年，有的是刚刚发生；有的曾引起注意，有的还是死角，但结果都一样：污染依旧，受害群众痛心疾首。难道当地政府对污染问题真的束手无策吗？不。关键在于决心。
        14:09 03-5-27 “抓经济能增加社会财富，抓环保不出成果。”
    “治理污染花钱太多，治理不起。”
    “污染源是经济大户，惹不起。”
    这短视的目光、纯经济观点和畏难情绪，影响着治理污染的决心。
    下决心治理污染，其实就是下决心造福于民。决心往哪里下？一是在认识人与环境的依存关系上下功夫；二是在具体措施上下功夫。当前，要以具体行动做好污染的预防和治理工作。对于排放污染的地方和单位，要限期治理；对污染危害大的企业则令其停产。
    环保部门的工作十分重要，需要社会各方面的支持，尤其是领导机关要给环保部门撑腰，使他们执行公务不受任何干扰。
