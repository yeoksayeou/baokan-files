Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 28th.

Reporter Zhao Xinglin reports from Beijing: Beijing Dong'an Group has strengthened financial management and improved service quality, breaking through the difficulties of sluggish market sales and severe inventory pressure. By November 5th, the company had already completed its annual tax revenue target of 11.77 million yuan.

The group consists of seven enterprise clusters, including Dong'an Market, Donglaishun Catering Company, Daoxiangcun Food Company, and Zhong'an Hotel. Starting in July, market sales began to decline, and inventory levels increased. The company's leadership analyzed the market situation and found that while products like color televisions and refrigerators had entered a buyer's market, some items were still in high demand. The key was to make the buying and selling process more dynamic. To this end, the company organized employees to participate in a service competition with the theme "Shine for the Enterprise, Solve Customers' Problems, and Provide Convenience."

The initiative began with renovating the store's appearance and beautifying the shop. Each product counter added customer consultation services and shopping guides, publishing 97 convenience services for customers, and restoring consultation services for large, high-end durable goods, including usage, maintenance, and repairs.

To overcome the financial pressures caused by sluggish market sales and tight bank lending, the company implemented strict financial management measures. The internal bank of the enterprise tracked the funds paid out, ensuring the quality of purchased goods and controlling quantities.

Due to strict control over purchases, the company effectively reduced inventory. Dong'an Market, one of the group's subsidiaries, reduced bank loans by 6.03 million yuan and inventory by 1.64 million yuan in just September and October.

To further reduce inventory and improve sales, the company analyzed customer consumption psychology and began offering rebates on certain products in October. Many slow-moving items saw a surge in sales. Statistics show that over a hundred washing machines were sold out in the first and middle of October, and consumer electronics such as tape recorders, cameras, and vacuum cleaners also found their way into consumers' hands.

　　销售滑坡库存增大　困难确实严重
　　强化管理优化服务　出路就在脚下
　　东安集团利税提前达标
    本报北京11月28日讯　记者赵兴林报道：北京东安集团公司强化资金管理和开展优质服务，走出市场销售疲软、库存资金占压严重的难关，到11月5日已完成全年1177万元的利税指标。
    这个集团公司由东安市场、东来顺饮食公司、稻香春食品公司和中安宾馆等7个企业群体组成。进入7月，市场销售出现滑坡，库存增大。公司领导从分析市场形势看出，彩色电视机、电冰箱等部分商品虽说进入买方市场，但有些商品仍属俏货，关键是要把买卖做活。为此，公司组织职工开展“为企业争光，为顾客排忧解难送方便”的服务竞赛活动。先是从更新场貌、美化店容入手，各商品柜增设了顾客咨询服务与购货导游员，公布了97项便民服务项目，恢复大件、高档耐用品的使用、保养、维修等咨询服务项目。
    为了克服因市场销售疲软、银行紧缩银根给零售商业带来资金不足的压力，这个公司采取强化资金管理措施，企业内部银行则对所支付资金实行跟踪管理，确保购进商品质量，控制数量。
    由于严把进货关，“减肥”有术亦有效。这个公司所属东安市场，仅9、10两月就实现压缩银行贷款603万元，压缩库存164万元。
    压缩库存“减肥”、“消肿”，这个公司还通过分析顾客消费心理，于10月开始部分商品返利销售，一些冷背滞销商品销势见旺。据统计，仅10月上、中旬，百余台洗衣机销售一空，收录机、照相机、吸尘器等，也源源进入消费者手中。
