Ideological and political work is a fine tradition of our Party and a significant advantage. The communiqué of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee states: "We must strengthen the Party's ideological and political work and continue the education and struggle against bourgeois liberalization for a long time." Through its ideological and political work, our Party has roused the masses, forming a vast revolutionary army that overthrew the rule of the three mountains. After the founding of the People's Republic, our Party, through correct policies and strong ideological and political work, not only guided the broad masses of peasants and handicraft laborers onto the path of socialist collectivization but also educated and guided private industrialists and businessmen to voluntarily take the road of joint state-private operation. This achieved the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production in a peaceful manner. It also mobilized and guided the people of the entire nation to engage in large-scale socialist construction, achieving remarkable successes that have attracted worldwide attention.

Why has ideological and political work become such a powerful advantage for our Party? This is because:

First, the Party's mission is to serve the people wholeheartedly. The political goals the Party sets, the lines, principles, and policies it formulates, are all based on the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people. The Party does ideological and political work among the masses not for its own special interests but to "help the masses understand their own interests and unite to struggle for these interests." Therefore, in its ideological and political work, the Party propagates and educates the masses based on the Party's lines, principles, and policies. The logic and direction it presents can be understood and accepted by the broad masses of the people. This is something that the ideological and political work of all exploiting classes (including those in the progressive stage) cannot compare with.

Second, our Party is the vanguard of the working class, armed with advanced scientific theory—Marxism-Leninism. It understands the objective laws of social development. The political goals the Party sets, the lines, principles, and policies it formulates, meet the objective requirements of historical development and can withstand the test of practice. Even when it makes mistakes, it can correct them. Therefore, in its ideological and political work, the Party can adhere to a thorough materialist attitude, relying on facts and the power of truth to persuade and educate people.

Third, our Communist Party members have the fine tradition of being strict with themselves, setting an example, and being consistent in words and deeds. In ideological and political work, the Party adheres to the principle of combining instruction with example, with example being more important than instruction. It always sets an example and leads by action. Whatever is required of the masses, the Party members do first; whatever is forbidden to the masses, the Party members strictly avoid. This determines the strong appeal of the Party's ideological and political work.

Fourth, our Party is highly organized, disciplined, and unified from the central to the grassroots levels. It has a unified system of ideological and political work organizations, which can ensure that various forces cooperate closely and act in unison. According to the unified deployment and requirements of the Central Committee, it carries out ideological and political education among the masses, forming a powerful force.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, ideological and political work has played a significant role in criticizing the "Two Whatevers," promoting the emancipation of the mind, and rectifying past mistakes. In recent years, in the process of implementing the Party's reform and opening-up policies, a large number of political work cadres have diligently carried out a great deal of work, making the Party's reform and opening-up policies deeply rooted in people's hearts. This has effectively promoted the progress of economic system reform and opening up to the outside world. However, overall, the Party's ideological and political work still has many problems, and its advantages have not been fully utilized. Many negative phenomena have emerged in the ideological realm. Trends such as "everything for money," pursuing immediate gains while abandoning lofty ideals, and considering personal interests while ignoring the interests of the nation and the people have grown. Shallow, vulgar, and even corrupt and decadent tendencies have emerged, and various evil phenomena that had disappeared after the founding of the nation have re-emerged. Particularly serious is the widespread spread of bourgeois liberalization, which has led to serious political turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots. Indeed, the causes of these phenomena are multifaceted. However, the weakness and mistakes of ideological and political work are undoubtedly a crucial factor.

In the new situation, to maintain and leverage the Party's advantage in ideological and political work, we must reflect deeply, clearly recognize, and resolutely correct the mistakes, so that ideological and political work can be effectively strengthened and improved.

We must place ideological and political work in its rightful important position. In recent years, a tendency to belittle or even deny ideological and political work has gradually emerged within our Party. Some comrades, under the banner of adhering to the Marxist principle of material interests, have emphasized economic means while downplaying the role of ideological and political work. Under the banner of "ideological and political work coming down from the commanding heights," they have denied the position that ideological and political work should have in the Party's leadership work. Some have even advocated money as the commander, using material incentives to replace ideological and political work. The ranks of political work cadres have been significantly reduced, and their social status has clearly declined. Many political work cadres have switched to administrative or other professional work, and even some Party secretaries have neglected the existing ideological and political work to pursue money, severely weakening ideological and political work.

The principle of material interests is an important principle of Marxism and should indeed be adhered to. However, we must not equate adhering to the principle of material interests with economic means. Economic means are only one way to regulate social material interest relations and are not the entire content of adhering to the principle of material interests. Scientific and powerful ideological and political work is also an indispensable condition for adhering to the Marxist principle of material interests. This is because:

First, adhering to the Marxist principle of material interests is fundamentally about helping the masses understand their own interests and uniting to struggle for these interests. The masses often rely on their direct feelings, emphasizing personal or small group immediate economic interests, and find it difficult to spontaneously recognize the fundamental interests of the class and the nation. Only through ideological and political work can the Party help the masses recognize the fundamental interests of the class and the nation.

Second, although the fundamental interests of the people are consistent, there are also many different interest conflicts within the people. To properly regulate these interest conflicts, it is necessary to sacrifice certain interests to ensure the realization of other interests. For example, sacrificing certain personal interests to ensure the realization of national or collective interests, sacrificing certain immediate interests to ensure the realization of long-term interests, etc. To make people willingly do this, relying solely on economic means will not work. Money cannot buy the spirit of self-sacrifice; it is also necessary to rely on the power of socialist morality and discipline. This requires ideological and political work to improve the moral standards and awareness of law-abiding behavior among the masses.

Third, the interests of the masses are not just material interests but also include many aspects of spiritual interests. For example, improving one's cognitive abilities and spiritual realm, shaping a beautiful personality, living in a harmonious and united interpersonal relationship, etc. This is even more something that economic means alone cannot achieve. Finally, even the selection and implementation of economic means themselves cannot do without the guarantee of ideological and political work. Imagine, if the thoughts of leading cadres are not straightened out, how can the economic means adopted be fair and reasonable? If the masses are not helped to understand the necessity and rationality of the economic means adopted, how can the masses willingly accept and obey them? Therefore, adhering to the Marxist principle of material interests does not mean that ideological and political work is useless; on the contrary, it is precisely necessary to rely on ideological and political work to guarantee it.

Abandoning the slogan of "political command" is necessary, and the slogan of "ideological and political work commanding" derived from it should also be abandoned. However, from this, denying the position that ideological and political work should have in the Party's leadership work and denying the leadership role of ideological and political work is to go from one extreme to another. Ideological and political work, of course, cannot replace the Party's leadership, but as an important means and method for the Party to lead other work, it is an indispensable important part of the Party's leadership work.

We must correct the direction of ideological and political work. In recent years, the guiding ideology of ideological and political work has shown a tendency: it only emphasizes mobilizing people's enthusiasm, serving the specific business work of a unit, and ensuring the completion of specific business tasks; it does not emphasize fundamentally improving people's political awareness and ideological and moral qualities, serving the realization of the lofty goals of socialism and communism, and ensuring that people's thoughts and all work develop healthily in the socialist direction. Some speeches and writings even reduce ideological and political work to simply mobilizing people's enthusiasm. Under this ideological guidance, education on the Four Cardinal Principles has been relaxed, Marxist revolutionary principles have been less talked about, and the ideals, morals, and disciplines of socialism and communism have also been less emphasized. Even the term "political direction" is hard to hear.

Ideological and political work should indeed mobilize people's enthusiasm and ensure the realization of various business work targets. However, its functions and tasks are not limited to this. More importantly, it should, through the education of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the Party's lines, principles, and policies, conduct education on the ideals, morals, and disciplines of socialism and communism, comprehensively improve people's political awareness and ideological and moral qualities, and promote and guide the masses' thoughts and all work to develop healthily in the socialist direction.

When we say that ideological and political work should play a serving and guaranteeing role, the "serving" here is not just serving a specific business work but serving the entire socialist cause; the "guaranteeing" here is not just guaranteeing the realization of specific business work but guaranteeing that our socialist construction cause has strong momentum and a correct development direction. Otherwise, how can the Party's ideological and political work be distinguished from other ideological work of different natures?

We must strengthen the principle and combativity of ideological and political work. In recent years, another important mistake in ideological and political work is that the principle and combativity have been significantly weakened. Some comrades, under the banner of "adhering to the guiding policy," have taken a laissez-faire attitude towards various erroneous thoughts, and active ideological struggles are no longer carried out. Even the most basic criticism and self-criticism have been abandoned. Under the banner of "respecting, understanding, and caring for people," various erroneous thoughts are indiscriminately sympathized with, accommodated, indulged, and tolerated, causing bourgeois liberalization and other decadent thoughts of the exploiting class to spread and grow seriously, occupying a large part of our ideological front. This is a profound lesson.

Doing ideological and political work should indeed adhere to the guiding policy. However, the complete meaning of guiding includes both guiding and leading. The so-called guiding is to allow the objects of ideological work to speak and not to block their speech with methods such as pulling hair, labeling, and beating. The so-called leading is to persuade and guide the objects of ideological work to consciously develop positive factors and overcome negative factors through facts and reasoning. Whether guiding or leading, the goal is to make the masses' thoughts develop in the correct direction, not to allow erroneous thoughts to spread freely. Using the method of criticism and self-criticism to carry out active ideological struggles, promoting correct thoughts and correcting erroneous thoughts, is itself an essential part of the guiding policy.

Doing ideological and political work should respect, understand, and care for the education objects. However, it should also be seen that ideological and political work is a highly principled political work. The respect, understanding, and care for the education objects must be based on adhering to correct principles. If principles are abandoned to talk about respecting, understanding, and caring for people, criticizing a certain erroneous thought is considered disrespectful, pointing out the erroneous nature of a certain thought is considered not understanding, not accommodating certain unreasonable demands is considered not caring, then what is the practical significance of doing ideological and political work?

We must restore and carry forward the fine tradition of being an example and being consistent in words and deeds. In recent years, due to the relaxation of the Party's own ideological construction, bourgeois liberalization and various corrupt phenomena have spread and grown within our Party, seriously damaging the Party's fine tradition of being an example and being consistent in words and deeds in ideological and political work. Some Party members and cadres, in the process of doing ideological and political work, publicly advocate adhering to the socialist direction, but privately spread doubts about socialism; educate the masses to be selfless, but themselves seek personal gain in every possible way; educate the masses to work hard, but themselves squander public funds. Some leading cadres even defend the high-ranking officials' children who have aroused public indignation for using special conditions to do business and engage in "official profiteering," seriously damaging the Party's prestige and reducing the persuasiveness and appeal of ideological and political work. In the new situation, to maintain and leverage the Party's advantage in ideological and political work, we must place the ideological education of Party members, especially Party cadres, in the primary position of ideological and political work. We must make a great effort to strengthen the Party's own ideological and style construction, strive to restore and carry forward the Party's fine tradition of being an example and being consistent in words and deeds, and effectively enhance the persuasiveness and appeal of ideological and political work.

    保持和发挥党的思想政治工作优势
    石陆园
    思想政治工作是我们党的优良传统，也是我们党的一大优势。党的十三届五中全会公报指出：“必须大力加强党的思想政治工作，把坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育和斗争长期地进行下去。”我们党却通过自己的思想政治工作唤起了民众，组成了浩浩荡荡的革命大军，推翻了三座大山的统治。建国后，我们党又是靠着正确的政策和强有力的思想政治工作，不仅引导广大农民和手工业劳动者走上了社会主义集体化道路，而且教育引导私营工商业者自愿走上公私合营的道路，用和平的方式胜利完成了生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造，并动员和引导全国人民投入大规模的社会主义建设事业，取得了举世瞩目的巨大成就。
    为什么思想政治工作能成为我们党的强大优势？这是因为：第一，我们党的宗旨是全心全意为人民服务，党提出的政治目标，制定的路线、方针和政策，都是以最广大人民群众的根本利益为出发点的。党做群众的思想政治工作，不是为了党自身的特殊利益，而是为了“使群众认识自己的利益，并且团结起来，为自己的利益而奋斗”。因此，党在思想政治工作中依据党的路线、方针和政策向广大群众进行宣传和教育，讲的道理、指的方向，能为最广大的人民群众所理解和接受。这是一切剥削阶级（包括处于进步阶段的剥削阶级）的思想政治工作所无法与之相比的。
    第二，我们党是工人阶级的先进部队，有先进的科学理论——马克思列宁主义的武装，能够通晓社会发展的客观规律。党提出的政治目标、制定的路线、方针和政策，符合历史发展的客观要求，能够经得起实践的检验。即使有时犯了错误，自己也能改正。因此，党在思想政治工作中能够坚持彻底的唯物主义态度，依靠事实和真理的力量去说服人、教育人。
    第三，我们共产党人具有严于律己、以身作则、言行一致的优良作风。在思想政治工作中，党坚持言教与身教相结合，身教重于言教的原则，时时处处发挥自身的模范带头作用，做群众的表率。凡是要求群众做到的，自己首先身体力行；凡是要求群众不做的，自己自觉不做，严格要求。这就决定了党的思想政治工作具有极强的感召力。
    第四，我们党是具有组织性、纪律性、高度集中统一的党，而且从中央到基层，有一个统一的思想政治工作组织体系，能够在组织上保证各方面的力量密切配合、协调一致，按照中央统一的部署和要求对群众实施思想政治教育，从而形成强大的合力。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，思想政治工作在批判“两个凡是”、促进解放思想、拨乱反正方面，曾发挥过巨大的威力。近几年，在贯彻党的改革开放政策的过程中，广大政工干部兢兢业业地做了大量工作，使党的改革开放政策深入人心，有效地促进了经济体制改革和对外开放的进展。但在总体上看，近几年党的思想政治工作还存在不少问题，其应有的优势远未充分发挥出来，在思想领域出现了很多消极现象。“一切向钱看”、追求眼前实惠而放弃远大理想、计较个人私利而不顾国家和民族整体利益、鄙薄自己的祖国和人民而崇洋媚外等思想倾向滋长了，浅薄、庸俗甚至腐化堕落的不良风气发生了，建国初期已经绝迹的种种丑恶现象再度出现。特别严重的是，资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥成灾，以致酿成严重的政治动乱和反革命暴乱。诚然，发生这些现象的原因是多方面的。而思想政治工作软弱无力，发生了失误，无疑是一个极为重要的原因。
    在新形势下，要保持和发挥党的思想政治工作优势，必须经过深刻的反思，清醒地认识和下决心纠正失误，使思想政治工作得到有效的加强和改进。
    要把思想政治工作摆到其应有的重要位置　近几年，在我们党内逐步滋长了一种轻视甚至否定思想政治工作的倾向。有些同志在坚持马克思主义物质利益原则的口号下，片面注重经济手段的作用而贬低思想政治工作的作用；在“思想政治工作从帅位上走下来”的口号下，否定思想政治工作在党的领导工作中应有的位置。有的甚至搞起了金钱挂帅，用物质刺激来取代思想政治工作。政工干部队伍大量减员，他们的社会地位也明显降低。不少政工干部改行去做行政工作或其他业务工作，甚至有些党委书记也放着现成的思想政治工作不做而去抓钱，使思想政治工作受到严重削弱。
    物质利益原则是马克思主义的一个重要原则，当然应该坚持。但绝不能把坚持物质利益原则与经济手段简单等同起来。经济手段仅仅是调节社会物质利益关系的一种手段，并不是坚持物质利益原则的全部内容。科学有力的思想政治工作，也是坚持马克思主义物质利益原则必不可少的条件。这是因为：第一，坚持马克思主义物质利益原则，最根本的是要使群众认识自己的利益，并且团结起来为自己的利益而奋斗。群众往往只凭自己的直接感受，偏重于认识个人或小集体眼前的经济利益，而难以自发地认清阶级和民族共同的根本利益。党只有通过思想政治工作才能帮助群众认清阶级和民族共同的根本利益。第二，虽然人民群众的根本利益是一致的，但在人民内部也存在着多方面不同利益的矛盾。要调节好这些利益矛盾，就需要牺牲某些方面的利益而保证另一方面利益的实现。例如，牺牲某些个人利益来保证国家或集体利益的实现，牺牲某些眼前利益来保证长远利益的实现，等等。要使人们自觉做到这一点，单靠经济手段是不能奏效的，金钱是换不来自我牺牲精神的，还必须依靠社会主义道德和法纪的力量。这就必须通过思想政治工作去提高群众的道德水准和遵纪守法的自觉性。第三，群众的利益，并非仅仅是物质利益，还包括诸多方面的精神利益。例如提高自己的认识能力和精神境界，塑造美好的人格，生活在团结和谐的人际关系之中，等等。这更是单靠经济手段所无法实现的。最后，即使经济手段本身的选择和实施，也离不开思想政治工作的保证。试想，若不把领导干部的思想搞端正，怎能保证采取的经济手段公平合理？若不帮助群众认识所采取的经济手段的必要性和合理性，又怎能保证群众心悦诚服地接受和服从呢？因此，坚持马克思主义物质利益原则并不是意味着思想政治工作无用了，而是恰恰需要依靠思想政治工作来保证。
    废弃“政治挂帅”的口号是必要的，由“政治挂帅”演绎来的“思想政治工作挂帅”当然也应废弃。但由此否定思想政治工作在党的领导工作中应有的位置，否定思想政治工作具有的领导作用，则是从一个极端走到了另一个极端。思想政治工作固然不能代替党的领导，但它作为党对其它工作实施领导的重要途径和手段，是党的领导工作必不可少的重要组成部分。
    要端正思想政治工作的方向　近几年，思想政治工作的指导思想出现了一种偏向：只注重调动人的积极性，为本单位的具体业务工作服务，保证具体业务的完成；不注重从根本上提高人的政治觉悟和思想、道德素质，为实现社会主义和共产主义的远大目标服务，保证人的思想和各项工作沿着社会主义方向健康发展。有不少讲话和论著甚至把思想政治工作单纯归结为调动人的积极性的工作。在这种思想指导下，四项基本原则教育放松了，马克思主义的革命大道理讲得少了，社会主义和共产主义的理想、道德也不大提了，甚至连“政治方向”这样的词语也难以听到了。
    思想政治工作当然应该调动人的积极性，保证各项业务工作指标的实现。但其职能任务绝非仅限于此，更重要的应是通过进行马列主义、毛泽东思想和党的路线、方针、政策教育，进行社会主义和共产主义的理想、道德和纪律教育，全面提高人的政治觉悟和思想道德素质，促进和引导群众的思想及各项工作沿着社会主义方向健康发展。
    我们说思想政治工作要发挥服务和保证作用，这里的“服务”，绝不仅仅指为某一项具体业务工作服务，而是指为整个社会主义事业服务；这里的“保证”，也并非仅仅指保证具体业务工作的实现，而是指保证我们的社会主义建设事业具有强大的动力和正确的发展方向。否则，我们党的思想政治工作还怎么与其它各种不同性质的思想工作区别开来？
    要增强思想政治工作的原则性战斗性　这几年来，思想政治工作的另一个重要失误，就是原则性、战斗性明显地削弱了。有些同志在“坚持疏导方针”的名义下，对各种错误思想采取放任自流的态度，积极的思想斗争不搞了，连起码的批评与自我批评也放弃了。在“尊重人、理解人、关心人”的口号下，对各种错误思想一味采取温情主义态度，无原则地同情、迎合、迁就、姑息，致使资产阶级自由化思想和其他剥削阶级腐朽思想严重泛滥和滋长，并且占领了我们很大一部分思想阵地，这是一个极为深刻的教训。
    做思想政治工作当然应该坚持疏导方针。但疏导的完整含义，包含着疏和导两个方面。所谓疏，是指要允许思想工作对象讲话，不能用抓辫子、扣帽子、打棍子的办法堵塞言路。所谓导，则是指通过摆事实、讲道理来说服引导思想工作对象自觉发扬积极因素，克服消极因素。无论疏也好，导也好，目的都是为了使群众的思想沿着正确的方向发展，而绝不是要放任错误思想自由泛滥。用批评和自我批评的方法来开展积极的思想斗争，扶植正确思想，纠正错误思想，这本身就是疏导方针的题中应有之义。
    做思想政治工作，应该尊重、理解和关心教育对象。但也应看到，思想政治工作是一项政治原则性很强的工作。对教育对象的尊重、理解和关心，必须以坚持正确原则为前提。如果离开原则去讲尊重人、理解人和关心人，一批评某种错误思想就认为是不尊重人，一指出某种思想的错误性质就认为是不理解人，不迎合迁就某些不正当的要求就认为是不关心人，做思想政治工作还有何实际意义？
    必须恢复和发扬以身作则，言行一致的优良作风　近几年，由于放松了党自身的思想建设，资产阶级自由化思想和各种腐败现象在我们党内蔓延和滋长起来，致使党的思想政治工作中以身作则、言行一致的优良作风受到严重破坏。有些党员干部在做思想政治工作的过程中，公开讲坚持社会主义方向，私下里又散布对社会主义的怀疑情绪；教育群众无私奉献，自己却千方百计以权谋私；教育群众艰苦奋斗，自己却利用公款大肆挥霍。还有个别领导干部甚至为已经激起群众公愤的高干子女利用特殊条件经商、搞“官倒”辩护，严重地败坏了党的威信，降低了思想政治工作的说服力、感召力。在新的形势下，我们要保持和发挥党的思想政治工作优势，必须把对党员特别是党员干部的思想教育摆到思想政治工作的首要位置，下大决心抓好党自身的思想建设和作风建设，努力恢复和发扬党以身作则、言行一致的优良作风，才能有效地增强思想政治工作的说服力和感召力。
