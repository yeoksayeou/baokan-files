	Small in Size, Big in Capability
	China's First Small Supercomputer Debuts

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 17 — The first small supercomputer in China, the NS1000, has been successfully developed through a joint effort by the Beijing Xintong Group and the Computer Science Department of Peking University.

	People typically categorize computers into five types based on their computational speed and scale: supercomputers, mainframes, minicomputers, microcomputers, and personal computers. This newly developed small supercomputer is a new member of the computer family. It possesses the computational speed and some functions of a supercomputer but has the size and price of a minicomputer, approximately 1% and 1/10 of that of a supercomputer, respectively.

	This type of small supercomputer has emerged internationally in recent years with the rapid development of high-speed, very-large-scale integrated circuits. The distinguishing feature of China's small supercomputer is that it breaks free from the constraints of traditional architectural design, allowing mathematical expressions to be processed directly as a single instruction. Its floating-point operation speed reaches 10 million times per second, with a system word length of 32 bits. It can be applied in fields such as petroleum, geological and mineral exploration, aerospace, scientific research, mathematics, and engineering technology.

    体积虽小　本领很大
    国内首台小巨型电子计算机问世
    新华社北京11月17日电　国内第一台小巨型电子计算机——NS1000小巨型机，由北京信通集团和北京大学计算机系合作研制成功。
    人们习惯上把计算机分为5个型号，即根据运算速度和规模，分为巨型、大型、中型、小型和微型。这台新问世的小巨型机，是计算机家族的新成员。它具备巨型机的运算速度和部分功能，但却只有小型机的体积和价格，大约分别是巨型机的1％和1／10。
    这类小型巨机，是近年国际上随着高速超大规模集成电路飞跃发展而出现的新型机种。我国的这台小巨型机，最大特点在于突破了传统体系结构设计思想的束缚，能够把数学表达式作为一条指令直接进行处理，浮点运算速度达每秒1000万次，系统字长32位。可以适用于石油、地矿勘测、航天航空、科研、数学以及技术工程等领域。
