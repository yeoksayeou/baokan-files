According to a survey conducted by the "Executive Yuan Department of Statistics" in Taiwan, the elderly population aged 65 and above currently accounts for 5.7% of the total population. It is projected that by the end of the century, the proportion of the elderly will rise to 8.4%, reaching the standard of an aging society as defined by the United Nations.

The survey indicates that the majority of elderly people in Taiwan live with their children, and the traditional multi-generational family structure remains prevalent.

Currently, 5.4% of the elderly population are unable to care for themselves due to illness and require assistance from others. Additionally, 6.7% of the elderly reside in hospitals, medical centers, or nursing homes for care.

Due to the high cost of medical care, which is beyond the financial means of ordinary families, the primary source of income for the elderly in Taiwan is their children. In terms of medical expenses, 65.5% of the elderly rely on their children for financial support. This underscores the enduring significance of the traditional family support structure in Taiwan.

    台湾老年人口概况
    据台“行政院主计处”的一项调查统计显示，台湾地区六十五岁以上的老年人口，目前已占人口总数的5.7％，预计到本世纪末老年人口的比重将增至8.4％，达到联合国所定的高龄化社会水准。
    根据调查，台湾老人大都与子女同住，传统的两代同堂的家庭组织仍占主要地位。
    目前因患病而无自顾能力需他人照顾者，占5.4％；住在医院、医疗中心或养老院疗养的老人，占6.7％。
    由于医疗费用高，非一般家庭经济能力所能担负，目前台老年人的经济来源主要依靠子女，在医疗费用方面，有65.5％的老人亦靠子女负担，这说明传统的家庭生存结构在台仍十分流行。
