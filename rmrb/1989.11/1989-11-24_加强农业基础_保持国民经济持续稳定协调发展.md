The decision made by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party on further rectification and deepening of reform requires the entire Party and the nation to mobilize and focus on improving agriculture. This issue is of great importance. We must strive to implement the spirit of the decision, truly place agriculture in a prominent position, and work together to develop agriculture.

Summarizing experiences and lessons, and effectively strengthening the agricultural foundation, to ensure the steady, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy

Over the past forty years, China has made significant economic achievements, but there have also been many mistakes. The main problems are: the emphasis on speed over efficiency in economic work; the fluctuation of production; and the severe imbalance in the proportion of industrial and agricultural development, as well as between processing industries and basic industries. The root cause lies in the guiding ideology that has deviated from China's actual national conditions and national strength. China has a large population, limited arable land, and a weak foundation. The primary task in economic work must be to solve the problem of feeding 11 billion people, and then to better carry out construction. Comrade Chen Yun's important thought of "first ensuring food, then construction" is the best summary of China's special national conditions. However, due to the lack of funds in China and the need for rapid industrialization, the contradiction between "ensuring food" and "construction" is very prominent. If leaders do not handle the relationship between the two well in decision-making, they will swing between emphasizing "ensuring food" and "construction," leading to instability and cyclical fluctuations in economic development. Apart from the ten years of turmoil during the Cultural Revolution, China's economic development has undergone three major adjustments since the founding of the nation. The fundamental reason is the imbalance in the proportion of the national economy, especially the imbalance between industry and agriculture, and the imbalance in the proportion between processing industries and basic industries.

From a longer-term perspective, China's population is increasing every year, while arable land is decreasing. Agricultural resources are limited, and agricultural and grain issues will be the most significant constraints on China's economic development for a long time. Therefore, the key to this rectification and adjustment is to adjust the economic development policies and industrial structure, to truly strengthen the foundation of agriculture, to coordinate the development of industry and agriculture, and to ensure the long-term steady and coordinated development of China's national economy.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China's rural economy has developed significantly through reform. From 1978 to 1984, the total grain production increased from 304.75 billion kilograms to 407.3 billion kilograms, with an average annual increase of 17 billion kilograms; the total cotton production increased from 2.16 million tons to 6.25 million tons, nearly doubling. The yield per unit area of grain and cotton increased by 40% and 100%, respectively. However, since 1985, grain and cotton production have stagnated.

In 1985, China's grain production saw a significant decrease. Although there was a recovery in 1986 and 1987, production decreased again in 1988. This year, there has been some improvement in agriculture, with increases in summer grain, early rice, and mid-season rice, but autumn grain production in the Northeast and other regions has decreased significantly. The total grain production for the year exceeded 400 billion kilograms, but it did not reach the historical high of 1984. Due to the lack of growth in grain production over the past five years and the increase of 67 million people, the per capita grain possession decreased from 395.5 kilograms in 1984 to 362 kilograms in 1988. Cotton production has also seen a significant decline. In 1984, cotton production reached a historical high, changing from import to export. However, in 1985, cotton production decreased by 33.7%, and in 1986, it continued to decrease by 14.7%; although there was a recovery in 1987, production decreased again in 1988 due to disasters.

The problems in China's agriculture also manifest in weak basic construction, with agricultural production conditions in a state of "exhausting old resources," deteriorating agricultural ecological environment, insufficient development momentum, and increased difficulty in advancing agriculture in the next decade.

The main reasons for the stagnation in grain and cotton production in recent years are: misjudgment of the agricultural situation, deviation in the guiding ideology and macro-decision-making of economic work, relaxation of agricultural basic construction, and impact on the improvement of agricultural productivity.

After the bumper harvest in 1984, China's agricultural situation, especially the grain situation, was overly optimistic. The richness of farmers was overestimated, leading to neglect and relaxation of agricultural production. In policy terms, some measures that objectively suppressed grain and cotton production were adopted, notably the change from proportional price increases to the "three-seven" fixed purchase price for state grain procurement, which reduced income in new commercial grain-producing areas. Additionally, the increase in the price of production materials, the release of prices for many economic crops, livestock, and aquatic products, and the decrease in the comparative benefits of grain and cotton production discouraged farmers' enthusiasm for grain production, resulting in a significant reduction in grain sowing area by more than 60 million mu in 1985, and a decrease in total production by 6.9%. Although the state has made minor adjustments to grain prices in recent years, the significant increase in the prices of fertilizers, plastic films, diesel, and other production materials has largely offset the benefits brought by the price increase to farmers. Due to the low procurement price of grain, farmers naturally shifted production factors to high-yielding economic crops and industries. The current grain procurement and sales policy and system are also economically disadvantageous to grain-producing areas, increasing the financial burden of grain-producing provinces. All these factors hinder the enthusiasm of farmers and grain-producing provinces for grain production.

At the same time, in recent years, with the continuous increase in population, arable land has also significantly decreased. From 1985 to 1988, four years saw a net decrease of more than 32 million mu of arable land, reducing the per capita arable land from 1.5 mu to 1.32 mu. The grain sowing area in 1988 was reduced by 156.97 million mu compared to 1978, and it was reduced by 60 million mu in 1985.

The fundamental reason for the above situation is the deviation in the guiding ideology of economic work, neglecting and weakening the foundational position of agriculture; financial, investment, credit, and material resources are tilted towards industry and urban construction, causing an imbalance in the development of industry and agriculture. In the thirty years since the founding of the nation, the growth ratio of industry to agriculture in China was around 2.8:1, from 1979 to 1984 it was 1.5:1, but from 1985 to 1987 it increased to 4:1, and in 1988 it further expanded to 6.7:1 (i.e., 20.7%:3.2%, with grain, cotton, and oil crops in planting industry at -0.5%), far exceeding the normal ratio of 2:1 that should be maintained in this stage between industry and agriculture. The development of industry has far exceeded the capacity of agriculture to bear.

Since 1987, grain special funds, land development funds, and agricultural development funds have been established, and agricultural investment has increased, but some funds still need to be realized, and the amount is insufficient. According to the State Planning Commission's investigation of fixed asset investment, the proportion of agricultural investment by the central and local governments in the first seven months of this year was 4.1%, a decrease of 1 percentage point from the same period last year, which was 5.1%. Meanwhile, local, collective, and farmers' investments in agriculture, especially grain, are also decreasing. Due to the reduction in investment, agricultural production conditions have not improved, effective irrigation areas have decreased, mechanical drainage and irrigation equipment have aged, and many water conservancy facilities have been damaged or even destroyed. The area under mechanized cultivation is only 43%, and more than 20% of agricultural machinery is overdue. In 1984, the application of fertilizer was 17.4 million tons (effective components), nearly doubling the amount in 1978, with an average annual increase of 1.43 million tons, but from 1984 to 1988, the annual increase was only 100,000 tons. The total amount of chemical fertilizer has remained at around 1 billion tons, with slow growth, while the amount of farmyard manure has significantly decreased. One-third of the townships and half of the villages in the country do not have a complete agricultural service system, and the material and technical foundation of agriculture is very weak.

In addition, the current agricultural management system has not been straightened out, with production, supply, and marketing separated, making it difficult to coordinate and solve some major problems in agricultural development in a timely manner; weak rural grassroots organizations and grassroots work are also important factors affecting agricultural production development.

China has great potential for the development of grain and cotton production, and it is completely possible to achieve self-sufficiency in grain and cotton through self-reliance.

From the perspective of increasing yield per unit area, among the 1.4 billion mu of arable land in China, two-thirds are medium and low-yield fields. The average yield per mu of grain is 200-300 kilograms less than high-yield fields under similar climatic conditions, and the yield of cotton is 50-60 kilograms less. The yield is extremely unbalanced between regions. At present, there are large areas of high-yield fields in both the south and the north, but the average yield per mu of grain in 1988 was only 350 kilograms. With increased investment and the use of advanced technology, it is possible to significantly increase the yield per unit area.

From the perspective of reclaiming wasteland and increasing multiple cropping, in the past forty years, China has reclaimed 3.7 billion mu of wasteland, but during the same period, 6 billion mu of arable land has been occupied, resulting in a net decrease of 2.34 billion mu of arable land, and the per capita arable land has decreased from 2.6 mu to 1.3 mu. There are currently 5 billion mu of arable wasteland and approximately 40 billion mu of grasslands and grassy mountains. In the future, while strengthening the protection of arable land, strictly controlling the occupation of arable land, establishing arable land protection areas, and accelerating grassland construction, if 10 million mu of wasteland is reclaimed each year, it can basically ensure that the area of arable land will not decrease starting from the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" (currently, approximately 50 million mu of land is occupied each year, and 100-200 million mu of land is destroyed by natural disasters). From the analysis of climatic resources, the multiple cropping index of China's arable land is 151%, with a potential of 10 percentage points. By promoting intercropping, relay cropping, and multiple cropping per year, each percentage point increase in the multiple cropping index is equivalent to increasing the sowing area by 140 million mu. Currently, there are 2 billion mu of winter fallow land in the south and 400 million mu of summer fallow land in the north that have not been developed and utilized. As long as production conditions are improved, water conservancy facilities are built, and a certain amount of fertilizer is invested, grain production capacity can be increased.

In addition, the post-harvest losses in various links of grain production in China, including harvesting, threshing, drying, storage, transportation, and initial processing, are very large, estimated to be 10-15% of the total grain production; the feed conversion rate is low, and a large amount of grain is used for brewing, resulting in serious waste in grain consumption. In summary, there is great potential for saving grain. At the same time, it is necessary to guide consumption according to the standard of 800 kilograms of grain per capita, to establish a food structure that suits China's national conditions, with a combination of coarse and fine grains, and meat and vegetables, and to develop the potential for saving grain and grass-eating livestock.

In summary, as an agricultural country with 11 billion people, at any time, we cannot rely on the international market to solve the demand for grain and cotton. Developing mutually beneficial international trade in agricultural products is very necessary, but large-scale imports of grain are not practical. We must and can rely on our own strength, fully utilize natural resources, advance in production depth and breadth, take the path of fine, sustained, and high-yield production, and vigorously develop production to solve the supply of grain and other major agricultural products in China.

We must seize this good opportunity of the three-year rectification and adjustment, through a real tilt towards agriculture, to achieve significant development in grain, cotton, and the entire agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production, and to lay a good foundation and accumulate momentum for the sustained and stable development of agriculture in the future.

The Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party proposed to quickly create a nationwide atmosphere of valuing, supporting, and developing agriculture, and to work together to develop agriculture, to ensure the stable growth of major agricultural products such as grain and cotton. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out that in the economy next year, special attention should be paid to two things, one of which is to vigorously promote the development of agriculture. This is a concentrated and powerful embodiment of the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's recent speeches on strengthening agriculture and the series of decisions made since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party to accelerate the development of agriculture. The current key issue is to implement the work. Effective measures must be taken to decisively adjust the structure of investment, credit, and materials, to truly tilt economic resources towards agriculture, to maintain the growth ratio of agriculture to industry at 1:1.5-2, and to achieve an agricultural growth rate of 3-4%, to substantially strengthen agriculture, the weakest link in the national economy.

The basic goals for the development of the rural economy during the three-year rectification and adjustment period are: first, to achieve coordinated development of the rural economy, with a focus on ensuring the growth of per capita possession of major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, oil, and sugar that are related to the national economy and people's livelihood. At the same time, oil crops, sugar crops, meat, aquatic products, and major township and village enterprise products should also maintain appropriate growth. Second, to ensure that the per capita income in rural areas, after deducting the factors of price increases, increases every year. Third, to strengthen the material and technical foundation of agriculture and further improve the comprehensive production capacity of agriculture.

To ensure the development of agriculture, comprehensive measures must be taken, while fully utilizing political advantages, to increase investment, and to take the path of development that combines economic investment with internal potential.

(1) Increase investment from all sides to strengthen agricultural infrastructure. The key to achieving steady growth in agriculture lies in increasing effective investment in agriculture. Investment in agriculture, including that from the central government, local governments, collectives, and farmers, should all be increased. The central government should first gradually increase investment in agriculture, which not only directly relates to major agricultural infrastructure construction and regional development projects but also plays an important guiding role in increasing investment in agriculture by local governments and farmers. At the same time, local governments should also increase investment in agriculture, with provinces, cities, counties, and townships gradually expanding the proportion of investment in agriculture. Farmers are the main body of agricultural investment, and they should be guided to increase investment in agriculture, especially in the production of major agricultural products such as grain and cotton. It is necessary to advocate for voluntary labor and to improve the labor accumulation system. Every year, large-scale agricultural water conservancy and afforestation construction should be organized, and this should be established as a basic system for China's agricultural construction and implemented for a long time. At the same time, agricultural water conservancy management should be strengthened, and the effective irrigation area of farmland should be increased. Another important aspect of increasing investment in agriculture is to vigorously develop agricultural industries and increase the production and supply of agricultural production materials such as fertilizers and agricultural machinery. Agriculture is an industry that transforms material energy, and for every increase of 500 billion kilograms of grain production capacity, 15 million tons of fertilizer, 50 million horsepower of agricultural machinery, 1.3 million tons of diesel, and 10 billion kilowatt-hours of agricultural electricity are needed. The development plan for fertilizers and other production materials during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" should be formulated, and the corresponding investment issues should be resolved. Next year, priority should be given to the import of fertilizers and other production materials with foreign exchange to ensure the basic needs of agricultural production. At the same time, the specialized management of fertilizers should be improved, the market for the operation of production materials should be cleaned up and rectified, and the prices of production materials should be strictly controlled according to state regulations to effectively control the rise in the prices of production materials.

(2) Adjust the procurement prices of major agricultural products to stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for the development of grain, cotton, and other major agricultural products. It is possible to consider determining the grain procurement price according to the relatively reasonable grain-fertilizer price ratio from 1979 to 1983, and then to arrange the procurement prices of cotton, oil crops, sugar crops, pigs, and other agricultural products according to the relatively reasonable internal price ratio formed over the years between major agricultural products. The price adjustment of grain and cotton must be considered simultaneously with the control of the prices of production materials, and procurement funds must be guaranteed to prevent the issuance of IOUs. To fundamentally straighten out the grain procurement and sales prices, to reduce the increasingly heavy financial burden of the state, and to overcome the current waste in grain consumption and other problems, it is necessary to decisively and plannedly reform the existing grain sales system.

The state should consider improving the quota and contract system for the allocation of grain and other agricultural products, to handle the relationship between grain-producing and grain-consuming regions, to encourage grain-producing regions to produce and transport more grain.

(3) Rely on technological progress to revitalize agriculture and organize agricultural regional development work. China's arable land resources are limited, and production development must take the path of mainly relying on technological progress to increase yield per unit area, and firmly establish the strategic idea of science and technology for agriculture. Every year, the "Harvest Plan" and "Spark Plan" should be formulated, and the promotion and application of scientific and technological achievements should be accelerated. To this end, first, it is necessary for the state and governments at all levels to support the establishment of agricultural science and technology promotion service organizations with townships as the focus, to strengthen the grassroots agricultural technology promotion teams, and to improve the conditions for agricultural technology promotion; second, to continue to deepen the reform of the science and technology system, to promote the paid transfer and service of scientific and technological achievements, and to implement various technical contract responsibility systems, to form a new mechanism for the active introduction of new technologies in agriculture.

Organizing large-scale comprehensive agricultural regional development not only has great potential but also has the conditions and has achieved some experience. In the future, it should be regarded as an important measure to develop new agricultural production capacity and to maintain the sustained and steady growth of agriculture. We envision that in the near future, the main focus should be on the comprehensive development of the fourteen major regions already determined by the state, and local governments should use local land development funds to implement local development plans. Through efforts, we strive to achieve the transformation of 30 million mu of medium and low-yield fields and the increase of 10 million mu of new arable land every year in the next ten years. At the same time, strong policy measures should be continued to resolutely stop and correct the blind occupation and waste of arable land, and to establish a basic farmland protection system, to stabilize the per capita arable land possession at the current level.

(4) Continue to encourage and guide the healthy development of township and village enterprises. In 1988, the output value of township and village enterprises was 650 billion yuan, accounting for 58% of the total social output value in rural areas and 28% of the total industrial output value in the country, with export earnings of 8 billion yuan, and 95 million employees, accounting for 24% of the rural labor force. The main body of township and village enterprises is the socialist collective economy, with the output value of collective enterprises at the township and village levels accounting for 67.2%, and fixed assets accounting for 75.5%. In recent years, half of the increased income of farmers has come from township and village enterprises. After nearly a year of rectification and adjustment, the overly rapid development of township and village enterprises has been controlled. The great achievements of the development of township and village enterprises over the past decade should be fully affirmed. It should be seen that without the development of township and village enterprises and other non-agricultural industries, there would be no outlet for surplus rural labor, the eight hundred million farmers would not be able to become prosperous, and the country would not be able to truly become strong. For the problems that have arisen in the development of township and village enterprises, first, they should be highly valued, and second, they should be handled carefully, and they should not be dealt with in a simple and one-size-fits-all manner. We support the policy of adjusting township and village enterprises proposed in the Central Committee's decision. First, according to the needs of macro-control of the national economy, the development speed of township and village enterprises should be reasonably controlled, mainly by reducing the scale of basic construction and taking the path of development with internal improvement as the main focus. Second, the industrial policy of township and village enterprises should be formulated, and the industrial and product structure should be further adjusted, with a focus on supporting products that are compatible with large-scale industries, export and earn foreign exchange, are labor-intensive, and process agricultural products, as well as energy and raw material production. Enterprises that waste energy and raw materials, seriously pollute the environment, and have poor economic benefits should be resolutely transformed and closed down in batches. Third, the internal management of enterprises should be continuously improved, economic benefits should be increased, and the ideological and political work of township and village enterprises should be strengthened, and the business style should be improved. Fourth, attention should be paid to guiding the reduction of returned rural workers and the closure of enterprises, to engage in fine farming, develop agriculture, and build water conservancy, to prevent blind migration.

Strengthening the leadership of agriculture, stabilizing rural economic policies, and ensuring the smooth implementation of rectification and adjustment and various rural work

To revitalize China's agriculture, we must carry forward our political advantages and fine traditions. We must take self-reliance and perseverance in hard work as an important guiding ideology for the development of agriculture. According to the decision of the Central Committee, it is suggested that: 1. Local party committees and governments at all levels must place rural work in a very important position, with the party and government leaders personally taking charge of agriculture, and clearly assigning specific responsibilities to the main responsible comrades to manage agriculture, and including population, per capita arable land, grain, afforestation, and income in the main indicators for evaluating the performance of leaders at all levels; 2. The central and local governments should formulate and implement long-term agricultural development plans based on agricultural zoning, with a focus on grain; 3. Continue to mobilize and organize various sectors to support agriculture, and relevant departments should formulate specific plans to create a nationwide atmosphere of valuing, supporting, and developing agriculture throughout the party and the country; 4. Strengthen leadership and improve the management system, and from the means and functions, truly strengthen the macro-management and coordination functions of the agricultural sector in the pre-production, in-production, and post-production processes; 5. Make great efforts to strengthen the construction of grassroots organizations in rural areas, and strive to establish and strengthen village party branches and village self-governing organizations within two years; 6. Strengthen ideological and political work in rural areas, carry out education on the basic line of the party, and occupy the rural battlefield with socialist ideology; 7. Agriculture must go up, and cadres must go down. Organize cadres to go to the grassroots to take charge of townships and villages, and to implement various work tasks.

To give farmers a sense of stability, it is necessary to clarify and stabilize the basic economic policies in rural areas at present. 1. The household contract responsibility system, with the family contract system as the main form, should be stabilized and continuously improved for a long time, with a focus on establishing and improving the service system and perfecting the dual management system. In regions with conditions, the appropriate scale management can be promoted in a stable manner according to the principle of farmers' voluntary participation, and the collective economy at the village level can be strengthened; 2. The pattern of coexistence of multiple economic components and multiple operation methods with public ownership as the mainstay should be adhered to, and the existence and development of individual and private economies should be allowed and actively guided; 3. The agricultural products that have been liberalized should not be centralized again, and the multi-channel and few-link operation should be adhered to; 4. Decisive measures should be taken to formulate some itemized and quota policies to stop the arbitrary levies on farmers and to reduce the unreasonable burdens on farmers; 5. Continue to adjust the industrial structure, while ensuring the stable growth of major agricultural products such as grain and cotton, further develop diversified operations and township and village enterprises, and fully activate the rural commodity economy.

    加强农业基础　保持国民经济持续稳定协调发展
　　何康
    党的十三届五中全会通过的《关于进一步治理整顿和深化改革的决定》，要求全党全国动员起来，集中力量办好农业。这个问题非常重要。我们一定要努力贯彻决定的精神，真正把农业放在重要地位，齐心协力把农业搞上去。
        总结经验教训，切实加强农业基础，
      保持国民经济持续、稳定、协调发展
    四十年来，我国经济发展成绩很大，但失误也不少。问题主要表现在：经济工作中存在重速度、轻效益的情况；生产大起大落；工农业之间、加工工业与基础产业之间的比例关系严重失调。究其原因，主要是在指导思想上违背了我国国情和国力的实际。我国人口多，耕地少，底子薄，粮食需求大。经济工作中必须首先解决11亿人口的吃饭问题，然后才能更好地进行建设。陈云同志讲的“一要吃饭，二要建设”的重要思想是对我国特殊国情的最好概括。但由于我国资金缺少，又处在加速工业化的阶段，使得“吃饭”与“建设”之间的矛盾十分突出。领导在决策时如不能处理好两者关系，就会在偏重“吃饭”与偏重“建设”之间来回摆动，不稳定，形成经济发展的周期性波动。建国以来，除“文革”十年动乱外，我国经济发展经历了三次大的调整，根本原因都是由于国民经济比例关系失调，尤其是工农业失调以及加工工业与基础产业比例关系的失调。
    从较长一些时期看，我国人口每年在增加，而耕地每年在减少，农业资源有限，农业、粮食问题将长时期是我国经济发展的最主要制约因素。因此，这次治理整顿的关键，就是要通过调整经济发展方针和产业结构，使农业的基础地位切实得到加强，使工农业发展相协调，以保证我国国民经济长期持续稳定协调发展。
      党的十一届三中全会以来，我国农村经济在改革中得到了很大发展。从1978年到1984年，粮食总产由3047.5亿公斤增加到4073亿公斤，年均增长170亿公斤；棉花总产由216万吨增加到625万吨，增长近两倍。粮棉单产分别提高了40％和100％，但是，1985年以后，粮棉生产出现了连续徘徊局面。
      1985年，我国粮食出现了大幅度减产，1986、1987年虽有恢复性增长，而1988年又减产。今年农业有了一些转机，夏粮、早稻、中稻增产，但东北等地秋粮减产较多，全年粮食产量超过4000亿公斤，但仍未达到1984年的历史最高水平。由于粮食生产五年没有增长，而人口五年增加6700万人，使粮食的人均占有量由1984年的395.5公斤下降到1988年的362公斤。棉花生产也出现了严重滑坡。1984年棉花总产量创历史最高水平，由进口变为出口。但1985年棉花产量下降33.7％，1986年继续下降14.7％；1987年虽有恢复性增长，而1988年又因灾减产。
      我国农业存在的问题，还表现在基础建设脆弱，农业生产条件处于“吃老本”状态，农业生态环境恶化，发展后劲不足，增加了后十年农业上新台阶的难度。
      导致近几年粮棉生产徘徊不前的主要原因是：对农业形势判断失误，经济工作指导思想和宏观决策出现偏差，放松了农业基础建设，影响农业生产力水平的提高。
      1984年，我国农业出现丰收后，对我国农业特别是粮食形势估计过于乐观，对农民的富裕程度估计过高，因而忽视和放松了农业生产。在政策上采取了一些客观上抑制粮、棉生产的措施，突出的是国家收购粮食由比例加价改为“倒三七”粮食定购价，使新商品粮产区降低了收入，加上提高生产资料价格，许多经济作物、畜牧水产品价格放开，使粮棉生产的比较利益下降，从而挫伤了农民种粮的积极性，使得1985年粮食播种面积陡减6000多万亩，总产下降6.9％。近几年国家对粮食价格虽然进行了微调，但由于化肥、农膜、柴油等生产资料价格大幅度上涨，大大抵消了提价给农民带来的好处。由于粮食收购价格低，农民很自然地将生产要素流向收益高的经济作物和产业。现行的粮食购销政策和体制也对调出粮食的产区经济上不利，增加了粮食调出省区的财政负担。这些都妨碍了农民和粮食调出省区种粮积极性的发挥。
      同时，近几年来，在人口不断增加的情况下，耕地面积又大幅度减少，1985年到1988年四年共净减耕地3200多万亩，使人均占有耕地面积由1.5亩下降到1.32亩。粮食播种面积1988年比1978年减少15697万亩，而1985年就减少6000万亩。
      造成以上情况的根本原因，在于经济工作指导思想上的偏差，忽视和削弱了农业的基础地位；财政、投资、信贷、物资向工业和城市建设倾斜，使工农业发展的比例失调。建国后的三十年，我国工农业增长比例在2.8∶1左右，1979—1984年为1.5∶1，而1985—1987年提高到4∶1， 1988年进一步扩大到6.7∶1
  （即20.7％∶3.2％，其中粮棉油等种植业为－0.5％），大大超过了现阶段工农业增长应大体保持2∶1的正常比例。工业的发展远远超过了农业的承受能力。
      1987年后建立了粮食专项基金、土地开发基金及农业发展基金，农业投资虽有所增加，但有的资金仍有待落实，数量亦不足。根据计委清理固定资产投资的调查，今年1—7月中央与地方的农业投资所占比例为4.1％，比去年同期的5.1％还下降了1个百分点。与此同时，地方、集体、农民对农业特别是粮食的投入也在下降。由于投入减少，农业生产条件没有得到改善，有效灌溉面积减少，机电排灌设备老化，许多水利设施失修，甚至遭到破坏。机耕面积只有43％，农业机械20％以上超期服役。1984年施肥1740万吨（有效成分），比1978年增加近一倍，平均每年增加143万吨，而1984年到1988年每年只增加100万吨。化肥总实物量维持在1亿吨左右，增长缓慢，而农家肥大量减少。全国有1／3的乡和1／2的村没有健全的农业服
  务体系，农业的物质技术基础十分薄弱。
      另外，现行的农业管理体制尚未理顺，产、供、销分割，使农业发展的一些重大问题得不到及时协调解决；农村基层组织和基层工作薄弱，也是影响农业生产发展的重要原因。
          我国发展粮、棉生产的潜力很大，
      依靠自力更生，实现粮、棉自给完全可能
    从提高单产来看，我国现有14亿多亩耕地中，有2／3的中低产田，粮食平均亩产比相同气候条件下的高产田低二三百斤，棉花低五六十斤。地区间产量极不平衡。目前无论南方北方都有较大面积的吨粮田出现，而1988年耕地粮食平均亩产只有350公斤，只要增加投入和采用先进技术，大幅度提高单产是可能的。
    从开垦荒地，增加复种看，四十年来，我国共开垦荒地3.7亿多亩，但同期占用耕地6亿多亩，净减少耕地2.34亿亩，人均占有耕地从2.6亩，减为1.3亩。现有宜农荒地5亿亩，草原、草山约40亿亩。今后在加强保护耕地，严格控制耕地占用，建立农田保护区，加速草原建设的同时，如每年开垦1000万亩，可基本保证从“八五”期间起做到耕地面积不再下降（现每年约占地500万亩，自然灾害毁坏100—200万亩）。从气候资源分析，我国耕地的复种指数为151％，还有十个百分点的复种潜力。通过大搞间作套种、一年多熟制等，每提高一个百分点的复种指数，14亿亩耕地就相当于增加1400万亩的播种面积。现在南方有冬闲耕地2亿亩、北方有夏闲田4000万亩没有开发利用，只要改善生产条件，增修水利设施，增加一定的化肥投入，就能增加粮食的生产能力。
    此外，全国粮食产后各环节，包括收割、脱粒、干燥、储存、运输和初加工过程的损失很大，据估计约占粮食总产量的10—15％；饲料粮转化率较低，酿酒用粮过多，粮食消费中的浪费也十分严重。总之，节约粮食的潜力是大的。同时，还要按人均八百斤粮食占有水平，进行适当的消费引导，粗细搭配、荤素结合，逐步建立符合我国国情的食物结构，发展节粮、草食家畜等这方面的潜力也很大。
    总之，作为一个拥有11亿人口的农业大国，任何时候都不能把解决粮、棉需求的立足点放在国际市场上。发展互利的农产品国际贸易是十分必要的，但大量进口粮食是不切合实际的。我们必须也完全可能依靠国内的力量，充分利用自然资源，向生产深度与广度进军，走精细、持久、高产的路子，大力发展生产来解决我国粮食及其他主要农产品的供给问题。
      必须紧紧抓住三年治理整顿这个良好时机，通过向农业的真正倾斜，使粮、棉以及整个农林牧副渔业生产有较大的发展，并为今后农业的持续稳定发展打好基础和积蓄后劲。
      党的十三届五中全会提出，要迅速在全国造成一个重视农业、支援农业和发展农业的热潮，齐心合力把农业搞上去，确保粮食、棉花等主要农产品的稳定增长。江泽民同志提出明年经济上要特别注意抓好两件事，其中一件就是狠抓农业的发展，这是贯彻执行小平同志最近关于加强农业的多次讲话精神和党的十一届三中全会以来一系列加快农业发展决定的集中有力体现。当前主要问题是工作上要落实。要采取切实有效措施，下决心调整投资、信贷、物资等结构，将经济资源的投入向农业真正倾斜，使农业与工业的增长比例保持在1∶1.5—2，农业的发展速度达到3—4％，使农业这个国民经济中十分薄弱的基础产业得到实质的加强。
      三年治理整顿时期，农村经济发展的基本目标，一是实现农村经济的协调发展，重点保证粮、棉、油、糖等关系国计民生的主要农产品的人均占有量有所增长。同时，油料、糖料、肉类、水产品和主要的乡镇企业产品等也要保持适当的增长。二是确保农村人均收入扣除物价上涨因素，每年有所增加。三是加强农业物质技术基础建设，进一步提高农业的综合生产能力。
        保障农业发展，必须采取综合措施，在充
      分发挥政治优势的同时，切实增加投入，
      走经济投入与内涵挖潜相结合的发展道路
      （一）多方增加农业投入，加强农业基础建设。实现农业的稳步增长，关键在于增加对农业的有效投入。农业投入，包括中央、地方、集体和农民的都应该增加。中央首先要逐步增加对农业的投入，这不仅直接关系到重大农业基础建设和区域开发工程，而且对于地方和农民增加农业投入，具有重要的引导作用。同时，地方也要更多地增加对农业的投资，省地县乡应逐级扩大对农业投资的比重。农民是农业投资的主体，要引导农民增加对农业，特别是粮棉等主要农产品生产的投入。要提倡义务投工，健全劳动积累制度。每年都要组织好大规模的农田水利以及绿化植树等基本建设，要把这作为我国农业建设的一项基本制度，长期坚持下去。同时要加强农田水利管理，增加农田有效灌溉面积。增加农业投入的另一个重要方面，就是大力发展农用工业，增加化肥、农机等农用生产资料的生产和供应。农业是物质能量转换的产业，每增加500亿公斤粮食的生产能力，需增加投入化肥1500万吨，农机总动力5000万马力，柴油130万吨，农用电100亿度。要制订“八五”期间化肥等生产资料的发展规划，解决相应的投资问题。明年要优先安排外汇进口化肥等生产资料，以保证农业生产的基本需求。与此同时，要完善化肥专营办法，清理整顿生产资料经营市场，严格执行国家规定的价格，切实控制生产资料价格上涨。
      （二）调整主要农产品定购价格，调动农民发展粮棉等主要农产品生产的积极性。可考虑按照1979——1983年间相对合理的粮肥比价来确定粮食定购价格，然后按照多年来主要农
  产品之间形成的相对合理的内部比价来安排棉花、油料、糖料、生猪等农产品的收购价格。粮棉等价格调整一定要与控制生产资料价格同步考虑，要保证收购资金，防止打白条。为了从根本上理顺粮食购销价格，减轻国家越来越重的财政负担，克服目前粮食消费上的浪费和其他种种弊端，应下决心有计划地改革现有粮食销售制度。
    国家要考虑完善粮食等农产品的调拨包干制度，处理好调出调入地区的关系，以鼓励产粮区多产粮、多调粮的积极性。
    （三）依靠科技进步振兴农业，组织好农业区域开发工作。我国耕地资源有限，发展生产必须走主要依靠科技进步提高单产的发展道路，牢固树立科技兴农的战略思想。每年都要制定“丰收计划”、“星火计划”，加速科技成果的推广应用。为此，一是需要国家和各级政府的扶持，健全以乡级为重点的农业科技推广服务组织，充实基层农技推广队伍，改善农技推广条件；二是继续深化科技体制改革，推动科技成果的有偿转让和服务。推行各种技术承包责任制，形成农业对新技术积极引入的新机制。
    组织较大规模的农业区域综合开发，不仅潜力大，而且已具备条件，取得了一些经验，今后要把它作为发展农业新的生产能力，保持农业持续稳步增长的一项重大措施。我们设想，近期主要抓好国家已确定的十四大片的综合开发，各地利用本地土地开发基金实施本地的开发规划，通过努力，争取今后十年内，每年能改造中低产田3000万亩、新增耕地1000万亩。同时，要继续采取强有力的政策措施，坚决制止和纠正盲目占用和浪费耕地的现象，并建立基本农田保护制度，把人均耕地占有量稳定在目前水平上。
      （四）继续鼓励和引导乡镇企业健康发展。乡镇企业1988年产值6500亿元，占农村社会总产值58％，占全国工业总产值28％，出口创汇80亿元，从业人员9500万，占农村劳力24％。乡镇企业主体是社会主义集体经济，乡村两级集体企业产值占67.2％，固定资产占75.5％，近几年农民所增收入一半来自乡镇企业。经过近一年来整顿治理，乡镇企业过快的发展速度已经得到控制。对于十年来乡镇企业发展的巨大成果应予充分肯定。应当看到，没有乡镇企业和其他非农产业的发展，农村剩余劳力就没有出路，八亿农民就不可能富裕，国家也不可能真正富强。对于乡镇企业在发展过程中出现的一些问题，一要高度重视，二要慎重处理，不能一刀切和简单化。我们拥护中央《决定》中关于对乡镇企业进行调整的方针。一是按照国民经济宏观调控的需要，合理控制乡镇企业的发展速度，主要是压缩基本建设规模，走以内涵为主的发展道路。二是制定乡镇企业产业政策，进一步调整产业和产品结构，重点扶持与大工业配套服务、出口创汇、劳动密集型和农产品加工的产品以及能源、原材料生产。对浪费能源和原材料、污染环境严重、经济效益差的企业，坚决进行改造并关停一批。三是继续完善企业内部管理，提高经济效益，并切实加强乡镇企业的思想政治工作，改进经营作风。四是要重视引导压缩回乡农工、关停企业的农民，进行精耕细作，开发农业，兴修水利等，防止盲流。
      加强对农业的领导，稳定农村经济政策，
    保证治理整顿和各项农村工作顺利进行
    振兴我国农业，必须发扬我们的政治优势和优良传统。要把依靠群众自力更生、坚持长期艰苦奋斗，作为发展农业的重要指导思想。根据中央的《决定》，建议：1、地方各级党委和政府一定要把农村工作放在十分重要的位置上，党政一把手要亲自抓农业，并明确主要负责同志具体管农业，把农业，包括人口、人均耕地和粮食、绿化、收入的增减情况等列入考核各级领导政绩的主要指标；2、中央和各地都应在农业区划的基础上制定以粮食为主的农业全面发展规划，长期坚持实施；3、继续动员和组织各行各业支援农业，有关部门要制定具体规划，在全党和全国形成一种重视农业、支持农业和发展农业的热潮；4、加强领导，完善管理体制，从手段和职能上切实加强农口对农业产前、产中、产后工作的宏观管理和协调功能；5、下大力气抓好农村基层组织建设，力争两年内把基层特别是村党支部和村民自治组织建立和充实起来；6、加强农村思想政治工作，进行党的基本路线教育，用社会主义思想占领农村阵地；7、农业要上，干部要下。要组织干部下到基层包乡包村，将各项工作落到实处。
    为了使农民有稳定感，当前需要明确稳定农村基本经济政策，保持政策的连续性。1、以家庭联产承包制为主要形式的生产责任制要长期稳定并不断完善，重点是通过建立、健全服务体系，完善双层经营体制。有条件的地区，可根据农民自愿原则，稳妥地推进适度规模经营，强化村级集体经济；2、坚持以公有制为主体的多种经济成份、多种经营方式并存的格局，允许个体、私营经济的存在和发展并积极加以引导；3、已经放开的农产品不再统起来，坚持多渠道少环节经营；4、采取坚决措施，制定一些定项、限额政策，制止对农民的乱摊派，减轻农民的不合理负担；5、继续调整产业结构，在保证粮棉等主要农产品稳定增长的同时，进一步发展多种经营、乡镇企业，全面活跃农村商品经济。
