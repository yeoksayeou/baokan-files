Recently, several enterprise leaders who were well-known in various regions and even nationwide have disregarded party discipline and national laws, used their power for personal gain, engaged in corruption, and fallen into decadence. These individuals have been punished by the law. The author refers to this as the "fall from grace" phenomenon. Reflecting on the "fall from grace" of a few entrepreneurs, we can at least draw the following conclusions:

We must further understand and adapt to the laws governing the growth of talent under the conditions of a socialist commodity economy. The vigorous development of a planned commodity economy provides equal competitive conditions and a broad stage for those with aspirations. However, the socialist commodity economy, like a vast tide, also ruthlessly eliminates those who, although having some talent, lack self-discipline in their personal behavior. The survival of the fittest is the law governing the growth of talent.

We must pay attention to improving the quality of entrepreneurs. For entrepreneurs, it is essential to integrate the improvement of personal quality throughout the entire process of pursuing a career and personal growth. One must ensure that personal quality improvement keeps pace with social development to achieve self-restraint and self-regulation in the complex realities of society.

We must evaluate successful entrepreneurs in a realistic and appropriate manner. For a period of time, the evaluation of entrepreneurs has often been characterized by "one good aspect covers all," where one good aspect overshadows all flaws. There has been an emphasis on promoting material civilization achievements while neglecting spiritual civilization construction. Successes achieved by entrepreneurs in reform opportunities have been seen as inevitable in their lives. These factors have played a role in the imbalance of self-evaluation among a few entrepreneurs. Therefore, we must break away from traditional evaluation methods and evaluate reform figures in a realistic and appropriate manner. This is the correct attitude to promote the emergence of talent.

    “落马现象”的反思
    最近一个时期，一些在各地甚至在全国小有名气的企业领导干部，无视党纪国法，以权谋私，贪污受贿，堕落成腐败分子，受到了法律制裁，笔者把这称为“落马现象”。反思极少数企业家的“落马现象”，至少给人们如下启迪：
    必须进一步认识和顺应社会主义商品经济条件下的人才成长规律。有计划商品经济的蓬勃发展，为有志者提供了平等的竞争条件和广阔的用武之地。然而，社会主义商品经济犹如大浪淘沙，也毫不留情地淘汰那些虽有一些才干、但个人行为缺乏自律的企业家。优胜劣汰乃人才成长的规律。
    必须注重提高企业家的素质。对企业家来说，必须将提高自身素质贯穿于事业追求、个人成长的全过程，要使个人素质的提高与社会发展同步，才能在纷繁的社会现实中做到自我约束、自我规范。
    必须实事求是、恰如其分地评价有成就的企业家。一段时期以来，对企业家的评价“一好百好”、“一好遮百丑”的现象比比皆是；片面宣传物质文明建设的成绩，忽视精神文明建设；把他们在改革机遇中偶然取得的成功视为其人生的必然。这些都给极少数企业家自我估价的失衡起了推波助澜作用。因此，必须摆脱传统的评价思路，实事求是、恰如其分地评价改革中的人物，这才是促进人才脱颖而出的正确态度。
