This summer, Jilin City Refrigerator Factory announced a decision: Jinoro brand refrigerators will be covered by a lifetime warranty. This is another manifestation of the factory's policy of prioritizing production and emphasizing after-sales service.

Each Jinoro refrigerator that leaves the factory comes with a "After-Sales Service Manual" and a "Jinoro Refrigerator Knowledge Q&A 100 Examples." The first page of the "After-Sales Service Manual" lists a complaint hotline, allowing users to directly call the factory if they have any issues with the product's quality. If maintenance is needed, users can find the address, phone number, and contact person of each Jinoro refrigerator's designated maintenance department nationwide in the manual. The "Jinoro Refrigerator Knowledge Q&A 100 Examples" book provides detailed information on refrigerator usage and maintenance, making it convenient for users.

Jilin City Refrigerator Factory pays attention to daily service, takes responsibility for users, and helps users solve problems. For user letters, whether requesting maintenance or asking questions, the factory's technical service center responds and maintains user records, insisting on visiting users. The factory requires that each maintenance point for Jinoro refrigerators must complete minor repairs within 3 days and major or medium repairs within 8 days. They also provide each maintenance station with a spare refrigerator for users to use during maintenance. If a repaired refrigerator has the same issue again, the maintenance point and operator will be held responsible. For refrigerators that need to be returned or replaced, the factory does not hesitate. For refrigerators damaged due to special reasons, the factory is more lenient. Three users had their refrigerators damaged in a fire, and after investigation, the factory replaced them with new ones.

Maintenance points are the foundation of after-sales service. Jilin City Refrigerator Factory has established 124 designated maintenance departments in 90 cities nationwide. The factory provides these maintenance departments with support and discounts while maintaining strict standards and management. They have held three training sessions to train local maintenance workers. The factory has conducted two inspections of local maintenance departments, organized quality service competitions among the maintenance departments, and commended several departments for their excellent service.

In the two years since production began, Jilin City Refrigerator Factory has produced 140,000 refrigerators. Jinoro refrigerators have been rated as excellent products by the Ministry of Light Industry and Class A products. High-quality products combined with thoughtful service have won the favor of more users. In the fierce competition of refrigerator sales, Jinoro refrigerators maintain a strong sales momentum.

    重生产，更重售后服务
    ——记吉林市电冰箱总厂的售后服务工作
    侯若雷
    今年夏天，吉林市电冰箱总厂宣布了一项决定：吉诺尔牌冰箱实行终身保修。这是该厂坚持重生产更重售后服务方针的又一体现。
    吉诺尔电冰箱出厂时，都附有《售后服务手册》和《吉诺尔电冰箱知识问答百例》。《售后服务手册》的第一页上就印有举报电话号码，用户对产品质量有意见可以直接给厂里打电话。需要维修，可以在手册上找到全国每个吉诺尔电冰箱特约维修部的地址、电话号码和负责人姓名。《吉诺尔冰箱知识问答百例》一书，详尽地介绍了冰箱使用及保养知识，方便了用户。
    吉林市电冰箱总厂注重日常的服务，对用户负责，为用户解愁。对用户的来信，不论是要求维修，还是询问有关问题，这个厂的技术服务中心都要回复，并建立了用户档案，坚持走访用户。工厂规定各维修点对吉诺尔冰箱维修必须做到小修不超过3天，大、中修不超过8天，并给各保修站配备了机动冰箱，供用户维修时替换使用。修理后的冰箱如第二次出现同一故障，要追查保修点和操作者的责任。对该退、该换的冰箱决不扯皮，对特殊原因损坏的冰箱更放宽条件。有3位用户因家中失火烧坏了冰箱，这个厂经过调查，给他们更换了新机。
    维修网点是售后服务的基础。吉林市电冰箱总厂在全国90个城市建立了124个特约维修部。厂里对这些维修部既提供优惠，大力扶持，又坚持标准，严格管理。他们先后举办了3次培训班，培训各地的维修工。工厂两次对各地的维修部进行整顿，组织各维修部开展了优质服务竞赛，表彰了一批服务得好的维修部。
    投产两年来，吉林市电冰箱总厂已生产冰箱14万台。吉诺尔冰箱先后被评为轻工部优质产品和A级产品。良好的质量加上周到的服务，吉诺尔冰箱赢得了更多用户的喜爱。在激烈的冰箱销售竞争中，吉诺尔冰箱保持旺销势头。
