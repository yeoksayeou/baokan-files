Song Ping, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the Organization Department, stressed today that cadres at all levels must make time to study Marxism-Leninism and institutionalize this practice. Only by raising the level of Marxism-Leninism among the broad masses of cadres can we enhance their ability to correctly understand the situation and solve practical problems, and lead the masses to better carry out the modernization of socialism.

Song Ping made these remarks today at a meeting with the seventh group of provincial and ministerial-level leading cadres and the first group of organization department heads in the Zhongnanhai Huairen Hall.

Song Ping said that cadres at all levels are very busy with their work, but everyone must make time to study Marxism-Leninism. In the future, we must establish a system for cadres to study Marxism-Leninism. Provincial and ministerial-level cadres should ideally attend the Central Party School for study once during their term. Cadres who are preparing to enter the provincial and ministerial leadership teams should ideally attend the Central Party School's theoretical class for a year. At the same time, various departments should hold short-term training classes in conjunction with the current situation and tasks, which can be held one or two times during a term. In their spare time, cadres should also consciously study Marxism-Leninism, and leading cadres should take the lead. Sharpening the axe does not delay felling the tree. Cadres who seriously study theory will achieve twice the results with half the effort.

Song Ping told the provincial and ministerial-level leading cadres attending the study class that you have studied theory for three months at the Central Party School and have made significant progress. After returning, you should use the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to work, and seriously implement the various resolutions of the Fifth Plenum. To implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenum, we must first have a correct analysis of the situation. Currently, China's political situation is stable, the party's ideology is relatively unified, the leadership teams at all levels are relatively united, and the economic rectification and order have shown initial results, with the overall situation being good. However, we must also see that there are still many difficulties in the economy. We must have sufficient estimates of the difficulties, but also see the favorable conditions for overcoming them. We have the confidence and determination to lead the masses to rely on their own efforts, work hard, and overcome the difficulties on the road ahead, pushing the great cause of construction and reform forward.

Song Ping pointed out that using Marxist-Leninist views to look at problems, our cadres must have an overall perspective, especially during the period of rectification and order. Song Ping said that everyone, whether working in the central government, local government, party and government departments, or enterprises, should always think about the overall interests of the country and have an overall perspective. In economic development, the interests of all parties should be considered, but conflicts will also arise. If conflicts arise, the local should serve the overall. We are a planned commodity economy, and only by further establishing an overall perspective can we ensure the smooth progress of rectification and order and the deepening of reform.

Song Ping also emphasized that cadres at all levels should pay attention to party building. He said that as long as the party's ideology is unified, the leadership teams at all levels are truly in the hands of Marxists, and the party's grassroots organizations are built well, party members can play a vanguard and exemplary role among the masses, the modernization of Chinese socialism will definitely succeed.

At the meeting, Vice Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee Gu Changchun, Vice Governor of Anhui Province Wu Changqi, Deputy Political Commissar of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Ni Haomei, Organization Department Head of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Zhao Qizheng, Party Committee Secretary of the Hebei Kailuan Mining Bureau Qiu Zhiyao, Deputy Head of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee Organization Department Zhang Chuanqing, Vice Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee Qin Yuchun, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics Zeng Peiyang, and Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Aerospace Industry He Wenzhi successively introduced their gains and experiences from studying Marxism-Leninism and expressed their opinions on how to further strengthen party building and political work cadres.

　　宋平要求各级干部
　　学习马列理论应形成制度
　　进一步树立全局观念搞好治理整顿
    新华社北京11月22日电　（记者孙本尧）中共中央政治局常委、中组部部长宋平今天强调，各级干部都要挤时间学习马列主义理论，要形成制度。广大干部只有提高马列主义水平，才能增强正确认识形势和解决实际问题的能力，才能带领群众更好地进行社会主义现代化建设。
    宋平是今天在中南海怀仁堂同第七期省部级领导干部读书班和第一期组织部长专题研究班的学员座谈时这样说的。
    宋平说，各级干部工作都很忙，但是，大家要挤时间学习马列主义理论。今后，要建立干部学习马列主义理论制度。省部级干部在一届任期内最好要到中央党校学习一次。凡是准备进入省部级领导班子的干部，最好先到中央党校理论班学习一年。同时，还要结合当前形势和任务，由各部门举办短期培训班，一届任期内可办一、二期。平时，干部也要自觉地学习马列主义理论，领导干部要带头。磨刀不误砍柴工。干部认真学习理论，会收到事半功倍的效果。
    宋平对参加读书班的省部级领导干部说，你们在中央党校学习了三个月的理论，很有收获。回去以后，要运用马列主义的立场、观点、方法进行工作，认真贯彻好五中全会的各项决议。要贯彻好五中全会精神，首先要对形势有个正确分析。当前，我国政治局势稳定，党内思想比较统一，各级领导班子比较团结，在经济上治理整顿初见成效，形势总的是好的。但是，我们也要看到，经济上还存在很多困难。对困难要有足够的估计，同时也要看到克服困难的有利条件。我们有信心，有决心，带领群众自力更生，艰苦奋斗，不断克服前进道路上的困难，把建设和改革的伟大事业推向前进。
      宋平指出，运用马列主义观点看问题，我们的干部一定要有全局观念，在治理整顿期间尤其要有全局观念。宋平说，大家有的在中央工作，有的在地方工作，有的在党政部门工作，有的在企业工作，但是都应该时刻想到国家的整体利益，都应有全局观念。在发展经济中，各方面的利益应当兼顾，但是也会发生矛盾。如果发生矛盾时，局部应该服从全局。我们是有计划的商品经济，只有进一步树立全局观念，才能保证治理整顿和深化改革的顺利进行。
    宋平还强调，各级干部都要关心党的建设。他说，只要全党思想统一了，各级领导班子真正掌握在马克思主义者手里，把党的基层组织建设好，党员能在群众中发挥先锋模范作用，我国的社会主义现代化事业就一定能成功。
    在座谈会上，吉林省委副书记谷长春、安徽省副省长吴昌期、新疆生产建设兵团副政委倪豪梅、上海市委组织部长赵启正、河北开滦矿务局党委书记笪政远、辽宁省委组织部副部长张传庆、重庆市委副书记秦玉琴、机械电子部副部长曾培炎、航空航天部副部长何文治等先后介绍了学习马列主义理论的收获、体会，并就如何进一步加强党的建设和政工干部建设发表了意见。
