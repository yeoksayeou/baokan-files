Beijing Asian Games Traffic to Be Smooth and Unobstructed

Beijing, November 4 — Reporter Miu Lu reports: The number of motor vehicles used during the Beijing Asian Games will set a series of new records in the history of the Asian Games. This morning, the head of the transportation department of the organizing committee disclosed these figures to the media for the first time.

According to the official, during the Beijing Asian Games, there will be more than 2,500 motor vehicles exclusively for athletes, staff, reporters, and guests. Among these, there are 550 large sedans, 550 vans, 1,200 small sedans, and 200 special vehicles. The total one-way distance from the Asian Games Village to various venues and the press center is 550 kilometers, with a plan to open 120 scheduled direct bus routes. Additionally, taxi stands will be set up at all 32 venues to provide temporary services. At that time, the Beijing Public Transportation Company will also open 22 additional public bus routes based on the distribution of the venues.

To ensure the safe operation of these vehicles and the smooth flow of all routes, the Beijing Municipal Construction Department has built 5 overpasses and opened 5 roads on the main traffic lines for the Asian Games. The transportation department of the organizing committee has also established 4 large dispatch centers and several traffic coordination offices, and has selected and planned specific routes for vehicles based on the city's traffic flow and road conditions.

The official also revealed that Beijing's major taxi companies have begun to conduct off-the-job training for their drivers, focusing on etiquette, simple English conversation, and other aspects. Next August, all drivers for the Asian Games will undergo centralized training. The vehicle service standards and regulations specifically designed for the Asian Games have been finalized and will be issued soon.

    北京亚运会交通将畅通无阻
    本报北京11月4日讯　记者缪鲁报道：北京亚运会的机动车用量将创下一连串亚运会史的新纪录。今天上午，组委会交通部负责人首次向新闻界公布了有关数字。
    据这位负责人介绍，在北京亚运会期间，仅专门供运动员、工作人员、记者和来宾使用的机动车就多达2500余辆，其中大轿车和面包车各550辆、小轿车1200辆、特种车200辆。由亚运村至各赛场和新闻中心的单程行车距离总和为550公里，计划开设120条定时直达班车线路。此外，在所有的32个赛场均设立出租汽车站，提供临时服务。届时，北京市公交公司还将根据赛场的分布，为观众加开22条公共汽车路线。
    为了保证这些车辆安全行驶、所有线路畅通无阻，北京市城建部门在亚运会交通主干线上先后兴建了5座立交桥、开通了5条马路。组委会交通部还专设了4个大型调度中心和一些交通协调处，并根据全市车流和路面状况，逐一选定、统筹规划具体行车路线。
    这位负责人还透露，目前，北京市各大出租汽车公司已开始采取脱产轮训的方式，分别对所属司机进行文明礼貌待客、简单英语会话等方面的教育；明年8月还将对所有亚运会用车司机进行集中训练。为亚运会专门制定的车辆服务标准和规程，业已成文，即将出台。
