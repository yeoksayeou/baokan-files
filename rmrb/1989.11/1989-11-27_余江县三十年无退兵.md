Yujiang County has sent over 6,000 high-quality volunteers to the army over the past 30 years, with not a single returnee, making it the first county in China to achieve this feat for 30 consecutive years. The county has been repeatedly commended by the General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army, the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and the Jiangxi Provincial Military Region. It has been awarded the title of "Advanced Unit in Recruitment Work" by the Ministry of National Defense.

Before liberation, Yujiang County was plagued by schistosomiasis. In 1958, it became the first county in the nation to eradicate the disease. The improvement in the health of the local people laid a solid foundation for selecting excellent soldiers. Various levels of leadership and relevant departments attach great importance to recruitment work, strictly enforce standards, and ensure that only those who meet the political, physical, and educational requirements join the army.

　　余江县三十年无退兵
    据新华社南昌11月26日电　（记者黄其庄、通讯员年荣俊）江西省余江县30年为部队输送优质义务兵6000多名，无一例退兵，成为我国第一个连续30年无退兵的县，多次受到解放军总参谋部和江西省政府、省军区的表彰，被国防部授予“征兵工作先进单位”称号。
    解放前血吸虫病猖獗的余江县，1958年在全国第一个消灭了血吸虫病。广大人民健康水平的提高，为选好精兵打下了良好基础。各级领导和有关部门重视征兵工作，严格把关，确保政治、身体、文化等条件符合标准的青年入伍。
