The General Headquarters of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea released a report on the rainy season's (May to October 1989) achievements on November 1. The report stated that the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea killed and wounded 17,200 Vietnamese troops and Phnom Penh puppet soldiers, and rendered 1,100 enemy soldiers incapacitated.

The report said that during this rainy season, the National Army liberated the city of Bailei and the county of Samlout, including its county seat, in October. They defeated the 879th Division of the Phnom Penh garrison, the 196th Division defending Bailei, and the 4th Division defending Samlout. The 95th Brigade of the puppet army was annihilated, and the 93rd and 92nd Brigades were severely damaged. The 309th Division of the Vietnamese troops stationed in Bailei and the 330th Division in Samlout were also defeated. The National Army captured 9 tanks, destroyed 6 tanks, seized 16 artillery pieces and 30 military vehicles, and destroyed 261 military vehicles. They also captured and destroyed over 900 enemy strongholds of various sizes.

The report mentioned that from August 25 to October 9, six Soviet 10,000-ton ships transported 49,000 tons of weapons and ammunition to the Vietnamese troops and Phnom Penh forces invading Cambodia. The Vietnamese authorities also sent an additional 14,960 troops to Cambodia.

The report stated that the 330th, 309th, 302nd, and 2nd Divisions of the Vietnamese troops, disguised, are fighting against the resistance forces in western and northern Cambodia.

The report emphasized that the coordinated efforts of the Cambodian resistance forces have yielded significant results. This does not indicate that the Cambodian resistance forces seek unilateral control but rather aims to compel the Vietnamese troops and the Phnom Penh regime to accept the five-point proposal put forward by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. The goal is to resolve the Cambodian issue through a fair and reasonable political process.

    民柬国民军总司令部发表雨季战绩公报
    柬抵抗力量协同作战节节胜利
    新华社北京11月5日电  据民主柬埔寨电台今天广播，民柬国民军总司令部11月1日发表的雨季（1989年5月至10月）战绩公报说，民柬国民军打死打伤越军和金边伪军1.72万人，并使1100名敌军丧失了战斗力。
    公报说，在这个雨季中，国民军于10月份解放了拜林市和三洛县及县城，击溃了金边卫戍部队879师、保卫拜林市的196师和保卫三洛县城的第4师，全歼伪军95旅，重创伪军93和92旅；驻守拜林的越军309师和驻守三洛县城的越军330师也被击溃。国民军缴获坦克
  9辆，击毁坦克6辆；缴获各种大炮16门、军车30辆，击毁军车261辆；攻克和摧毁敌军大小据点900多处。
    公报说，8月25日到10月9日，苏联6艘万吨海轮向侵柬越军和金边军队运送了4.9万吨武器和弹药，越南当局向柬埔寨增派军队1.496万人。
    公报说，经过伪装的越军330师、309师、302师和第2师正在柬埔寨西部和北部战场与抵抗力量作战。
    公报说，柬埔寨抵抗力量协同作战，战果累累，这不表明柬埔寨抵抗力量想单方面掌权，而是迫使越军和金边政权接受诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王提出的5点建议，公正合理地通过政治途径解决柬埔寨问题。
