Title: A Step Ahead

The director of the Yulin Diesel Engine Factory, Wang Jianming, works twice as many hours as the average person, and his work pace is a step ahead. He says, "I am the leader of the factory, so I must think ahead and act ahead. I cannot have short-term thinking; I must have a forward-looking mindset and make forward-looking decisions."

"When workers are busy, being the director is easy"

In 1984, the factory's flagship product, the swirl chamber diesel engine (6105Q), was planned to produce 1,000 units. However, by the end of April, only 96 units had been assembled, and orders from various regions totaled only 330 units. The warehouse was filled with spare parts, and the turnover period for working capital reached 512 days. Quality incidents occurred frequently. At the factory meeting, people started shouting, "The task cannot be completed! The plan needs to be reduced!"

At that time, Wang Jianming, who was the deputy director, was responsible for the operational work and understood the market demand. In the automotive industry, diesel engines have unique advantages. They are cheaper and safer than gasoline engines. At the meeting, he said, "The production volume is not increasing because our overall capability is insufficient, but because some links have problems; it is not because our workload exceeds our capability, but because people's minds are wandering, management is chaotic, and responsibilities are unclear." After the meeting, Wang Jianming led the cadres to conduct investigations inside and outside the factory, within and outside the city, repeatedly verifying and formulating an economic responsibility system centered on quality, with rights, responsibilities, and benefits closely linked, and a target of producing 1,000 units per year.

"Everyone has a quota to carry." In just one month, the production volume broke through 130 units, and the quality improved rapidly. By the end of the year, 1,120 units were completed. In 1985, Wang Jianming became the director, with a plan to produce 3,000 units per year, and the actual production was 3,010 units. In 1986, 4,507 units were completed.

Wang Jianming often says, "The factory's potential is great. With a full workload, workers work hard, production increases, and quality improves. We directors have an easier job. Workers with no work to do are the hardest to manage, and idle time leads to trouble..."

"Products must be updated by ourselves"

After becoming the director, Wang Jianming had to think long-term about every matter: "This factory was established in 1951. Over the past thirty years, the products have changed, and the factory has developed, but the buildings are dilapidated, the equipment is outdated, the technology is backward, and people want to leave." "The stagnation of product levels is the end of the factory's life." "We must be aware that there are 'rivals' all around us. We must dare to eliminate our own products."

Wang Jianming led everyone to expand the factory, purchase equipment, and establish a brand-new automated assembly line. He also cooperated with the Shanghai Internal Combustion Engine Research Institute to change the swirl chamber combustion system to a direct injection system. The new product 6105QA, compared to 6105Q, reduces the heat flow by 50%, lowers fuel consumption by 13%, eliminates various problems caused by overheating, and significantly reduces transportation costs. People from all over the country rushed to place orders. Those who did not get the orders even cried.

"Dissatisfaction is the driving force for progress." Wang Jianming proposed new goals, leading everyone to catch up with international standards, developing a lighter and more powerful 6110Q type diesel engine and a fully hydraulic excavator and agricultural vehicles that showcase the level of the 1990s...

"Only with a stable home can one be dedicated to work"

The factory borrowed money, spent money, and also made money. Not only did it repay the loans, but it also had a large surplus. People discussed, "The office building from the 1950s needs to be replaced!" Wang Jianming, however, decided to build staff dormitories first: "Only with a stable home can one be dedicated to work! The factory's concern for the staff's life will motivate the staff to work harder. We not only need to build family dormitories but also single staff housing. Our factory has 70% part-time workers, and we cannot let them keep going to the countryside. We need to let the family reunite in the factory." "We need to build a club and a swimming pool." "We need to play more Beethoven music, so there will be fewer people swearing, spitting, and throwing melon seeds. A refined environment can reduce rude behavior."

At first, many people thought these were all "fairy tales." Seeing the dormitories being handed over one by one, the club, canteen, and swimming pool being built, people understood that Wang Jianming's fast pace and forward planning were based on realistic possibilities.

Originally, the labor and personnel department was the busiest unit in the factory. People came and went, requesting transfers. Now, it is still the busiest unit in the factory, with people coming and going, requesting to be transferred back or in.

    快一拍
    ——记玉林柴油机厂厂长王建明
    本报记者　刘衡
    广西玉林柴油机厂厂长王建明的工作时间比一般人多一倍，他的工作速度比一般人快一拍。他说：“我是工厂打头的，当然要想在前，走在前。不能有短期行为，一定要有超前意识和超前决策。”
    “职工工作一紧张，厂长就好当”
    1984年，工厂的拳头产品——涡流室式柴油机（6105Q）计划生产1000台。可是，到4月底，才装机96台，各地来订货的只有330台。仓库里零配件积压，流动资金周转期高达512天，质量事故不断发生。厂务会上，人们嚷嚷开了：“任务完不成啦，计划要削减！”
    当时是副厂长的王建明负责经营工作，了解市场需求。在汽车工业中，柴油机有独特的优点。它比汽油机便宜、安全。在会上，他说：“产量上不去，不是我们整体能力不足，而是个别环节有毛病；不是由于我们的负荷超能力，而是人心跑野马，管理混乱，责任不明。”会后，王建明领着干部们在厂内、厂外、市内、市外进行调查，反复论证，制订了以质量为中心、责权利紧密挂钩的经济责任制和年产1000台的目标。
    “千斤担子众人挑，人人身上有指标”。只一个月，产量就突破130台，质量也迅速改进。到年底，竟完成1120台。1985年，王建明当了厂长，计划年产3000台，结果完成3010台。1986年，竟完成4507台。
    王建明常说：“工厂的潜力是很大的。任务饱满，职工紧张地工作，产量上去，质量也上去了。咱们当厂长的就省心、好当。没活干的工人最难管，无事就要生非……”
    “产品靠自家更新”
    王建明当了厂长，遇事更要从长计议：“这个厂是1951年创建的。三十多年来，产品虽有变化，工厂也有发展，但厂房衰败，设备陈旧，技术落后，人心思走。”“产品水平的停滞，就是工厂生命的终结。”“我们要求生存，必须意识到四周都埋伏着‘劲敌’。自己的产品，自己要敢于淘汰。”
    王建明领着大伙儿扩建厂房，购买设备，建立全新的自动化流水生产线。还跟上海内燃机研究所合作，把涡流室式燃烧系统改为直接喷射式。新产品6105QA与6105Q相比，热流量减少50％，燃料油耗下降13％，根治了由于水温过高而造成的种种弊端，大幅度降低了运输成本。全国各地抢着来订货。没有抢到手的人甚至急得掉眼泪。
    “不满足是向上的车轮”。王建明又提出新目标，领着大伙儿赶超国际水平，研制出重量更轻、功率更大的6110Q型柴油机和显示90年代水平的全液压挖掘机、农用汽车……
    “安居才能乐业”
    工厂借钱，用钱，也赚了钱。不但还清了贷款，还剩下一大笔。人们纷纷议论：“50年代的办公楼得换一换了！”王建明呢，却决定先盖职工宿舍：“安居才能乐业嘛！厂里对职工生活多一分关心，职工就能多增十分干劲。我们不但要盖家属宿舍，还要盖单身职工的住房。咱们工厂70％是半边户，不能老让他们往农村跑，要让家属到工厂团圆。”“要盖俱乐部，建游泳池。”“要多放一放贝多芬音乐，就少有人说粗话，随便吐痰，扔瓜子壳。高雅的环境，可减少粗鲁的动作。”
    开头，好些人以为这些都是“天方夜谭”。眼看一栋栋宿舍交付使用了，俱乐部、食堂、游泳池在建了，人们明白了王建明的快节奏、超前规划等等，是建立在现实可能的基础上的。
    原先，劳动人事科是工厂最忙碌的单位。人们进进出出，要求调走。如今，它还是工厂最忙碌的单位，人们进进出出，要求调回来，调进来。
