Nujoma Says Namibia's Independence Cannot Be Delayed
Democratic Turnhalle Alliance Willing to Cooperate with SWAPO

NEW YORK, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), Sam Nujoma, said today that SWAPO's simple majority in the pre-independence elections gives it the responsibility to "ensure that Namibia's independence is not further delayed."

Nujoma made the remarks at his first press conference after the elections. He said that SWAPO's victory in the elections is not only a historic achievement for SWAPO but also for the entire Namibian people. He said that in the five days of voting, there were no losers because the country had won the right to self-determination, which had been denied for so long.

As the largest nationalist party in Namibia, SWAPO won 41 out of the 72 seats in the Constituent Assembly in last week's elections. This gives SWAPO the right to convene the assembly next week to draft a constitution and determine the date of independence.

Regarding the principles of drafting the constitution, Nujoma said, "We have no intention of imposing our views on other parties."

He reiterated SWAPO's principles of national reconciliation and cooperation with all sectors of society.

Regarding foreign relations, Nujoma said that an independent Namibia is willing to maintain friendly relations with both the West and the East and to establish broad diplomatic relations with all countries in the world. He said that SWAPO will also seek to join regional and economic organizations, the Organization of African Unity, and the United Nations.

He also discussed issues such as Walvis Bay, South African troops stationed in Namibia, and the struggle of black South Africans. He said that he would not deal with the minority white rule in South Africa and would only be willing to have relations with a non-racialist South Africa.

According to another report, the chairman of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), Dirk Mudge, and the first vice-chairman, Mishake Muyongo, said that the alliance, composed of 11 parties, accepts the election results that reflect the will of the people and will closely cooperate with SWAPO to liberate Namibia from South African rule as soon as possible.

The Democratic Action Group of Namibia, which won 4 seats, the Christian National Action Party, which won 3 seats, and the Namibia National Patriotic Front, which won 1 seat, also expressed their acceptance of the election results.

Since SWAPO won only 41 seats in the assembly, it does not have the two-thirds majority of 48 seats. Therefore, it will form a coalition government with other parties, especially the DTA, which won 21 seats.

### 努乔马表示纳独立不能拖延  特恩哈尔民主联盟表示愿与人组合作

    努乔马表示纳独立不能拖延
    特恩哈尔民主联盟表示愿与人组合作
    新华社温得和克11月15日电　西南非洲人民组织（人组）主席努乔马今天说，人组在独立前大选中赢得的简单多数票赋予了人组“保证纳米比亚独立不再延迟”的责任。
    努乔马今天在他大选后举行的第一次记者招待会上说，人组在大选中获胜不仅对于人组而且对于整个纳米比亚都是“一个历史性的成就”。他说，在5天的选举中没有失败者，因为这为国家赢得了长期被剥夺的自决的权利。
    作为纳米比亚最大的民族主义政党，人组在上周的大选中赢得了制宪议会72个席位的41席。这使人组有权在下周召开议会，制定宪法，确定独立日期。
    关于制定宪法的原则，努乔马说：“我们无意把自己的观点加在其它党派头上。”
    他重申了人组的民族和解原则和与社会各阶层合作的思想。
    关于对外关系，努乔马说，独立的纳米比亚愿意与西方和东方保持友好关系，同世界所有国家建立广泛外交关系。他说，人组还将寻求加入地区和经济组织、非洲统一组织和联合国。
    他还谈到了沃尔维斯海湾、南非滞纳军队和南非黑人的斗争等问题。他说，他将不同少数白人统治的南非打交道，只愿意与非种族主义的南非发生关系。
    另据报道，特恩哈尔民主联盟（联盟）主席德克·马奇和第一副主席米谢科·穆荣戈表示，由11个政党组成的联盟接受代表人民意愿的大选结果，并与人组密切合作，使纳米比亚早日从南非统治下解放出来。
    在议会中赢得4席的民主联合阵线、赢得3席的基督教全国行动党和赢得1席的纳米比亚民族爱国阵线，也都表示接受大选结果。
    由于人组在议会中只赢得41席，没有超过2／3多数的48席，所以它将与其它政党，特别是赢得21席的联盟，联合组织政府。
