Movie theaters in department stores have become a novel trend in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand. The establishment of movie theaters within department stores serves two main purposes: to attract more customers and boost sales, and to provide a resting place for shoppers. Since the introduction of movie theaters in department stores, customer foot traffic has significantly increased, leading to a surge in business revenue. Consequently, such movie theaters have proliferated rapidly. Statistics show that as of now, there are twenty-four department stores in Bangkok that have opened movie theaters.

Typically, these small movie theaters within department stores have around a hundred seats. They can screen both films and videos, and some are equipped with air conditioning, offering a quiet and comfortable environment. Additionally, most movie theaters have a counter at the entrance for customers to deposit their small items, making them very popular among shoppers.

    百货店里的电影院
    百货店里开设电影院，这是泰国首都曼谷的一件新鲜事。在百货店内开设电影院，目的有两个，一为了吸引更多的顾客，增加销售额，二为顾客提供休息的场所。自百货店开设了电影院后，顾客如云，门庭若市，营业额直线上升。于是，这种百货店里的电影院便如雨后春笋般出现。据统计，迄今曼谷全市已有二十四家百货商店开办了电影院。
    百货商店内的小电影院一般只有百十来个座位，既可放电影，也可放录像，有些内部还装有空调，既安静又舒适，而且在电影院门口一般都设有替观众保管小件物品的专柜，所以很受欢迎。林若　编译
