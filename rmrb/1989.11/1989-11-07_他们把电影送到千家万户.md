In the star-studded world of the film industry, projectionists are the most unassuming professionals. Yet, without them bringing films to millions of viewers, how could blockbusters create a sensation, and how could stars become famous?

At the national film distribution and projection work advanced collective and advanced worker experience exchange conference, I met some projectionists from all over the country and heard their plain-spoken accounts of daily life.

High Chenguan, leader of the Dongtang Island Film Team in Pingtan County, Fujian Province:

Our Dongtang Island is a small island with an area of less than 5 square kilometers and a population of just over 9,000 people. The island has poor transportation and harsh natural conditions. Since 1974, our three-person film team has been tirelessly working on this island scattered with seven natural villages.

In recent years, due to the quiet rise of cross-strait trade, Dongtang Island's commodity economy has been very active, and many people have become wealthy. However, because we insist on showing films, our income is meager. I'm not afraid to admit that this suit I'm wearing was borrowed before coming to Beijing. Some of our wealthy relatives have advised us to "start our own business" and offered to provide convenience, but we replied: "We've done this for 15 years; it would be a shame to give up now. We are all Party members and cannot let the film industry on the island fall into disrepair."

During the peak fishing season, fishermen don't return to the island until 9 PM, so we have to start showing films after 10 PM. We've all become night owls.

In recent years, fishermen on the island have more money and want to spend big on weddings. We proactively visit them and encourage fellow villagers to change from lavish weddings to screening films for guests, which is both lively and economical. Before the screening, we use a slide projector to display the message: "Congratulations to [name] on their happy union. Movie screening for guests. Wishing the newlyweds a loving and harmonious life, working together to become wealthy." Everyone applauds, and these practices have gradually become a trend, promoting the construction of spiritual civilization in the fishing village.

Yan Changhui, projection technician of the 135th team of Sichuan Coal Geological Company:

After graduating from the coal mining school, I joined the geological team and saw that the team members had a poor cultural life. In 1972, I switched to showing films. Now, I am responsible for the projection tasks of all 12 points in our team. Every month, I have to cover these 12 points distributed across 9 counties (districts), spending about 25 days away from home. My son was born, and I only saw him half a month later.

The geological team's bases are mostly in mountainous areas. Even with a TV, it's hard to receive signals, so everyone looks forward to watching films. I travel during the day and show films at night, sometimes walking for six or seven hours from one point to another, carrying the projector and screen poles myself. After 17 years of showing films, I have walked over 10,000 kilometers.

Our equipment is not like the stationary projectors in big city theaters; we have to show films outdoors and carry them over mountains and valleys. I maintain and repair three sets of equipment monthly. The Changjiang 54-type projector used since 1957 is still in perfect condition, with not a single damaged corner on any of the boxes. In these 17 years, every screening has been of high quality and safe.

The screen is the projectionist's face. I wash my two screens every month, and even when they are old, they remain clean and white.

Zhao Keqing, projectionist of Xiangride Town, Dulan County, Qinghai Province:

I came to Qinghai from my hometown in Henan in 1957 and voluntarily went to Xiangride to establish a film projection team in 1974. This township covers an area of 13,000 square kilometers, with an average altitude of 3,500 meters and an average annual temperature of 2.7°C. There are nearly 20,000 people living in scattered residences. The township has 15 projection points, and it takes at least half a day to travel from one point to another, with the farthest taking two days.

Our township is home to over 30% Mongols and Tibetans. Besides organizing screenings of films in local languages, I also provide commentary to help farmers and herdsmen understand the films.

Since the film team was established, many farmers and herdsmen have seen a film for the first time in their lives. They touch the screen and don't want to leave, asking me about the secrets of the film. Every time the film ends, herdsmen eagerly pull me into their tents, offer hadas (ceremonial scarves), pour milk tea, and offer fine wine. At these moments, my heart feels warm and happy.

    他们把电影送到千家万户
    本报记者　袁晞
    在明星荟萃的电影界，放映员是最不起眼的职业，可是如果没有他们把电影放映给千万观众，巨片怎能轰动，明星何以成名？
    在全国电影发行放映工作先进集体、先进工作者经验交流会上，我结识了一些来自全国各地的放映员，听到他们用平凡话语叙述的一些日常生活。
    福建省平潭县东庠电影队队长高诚官：
    我们东庠岛是一个面积不足5平方公里、人口只有9000多人的小海岛。岛上交通不便，自然条件恶劣，我们三个人组成的电影队，1974年以来一直奔波在这个散落着7个自然村的小岛上。
    近年来由于海峡两岸民间贸易悄然兴起，东庠岛的商品经济非常活跃，很多人已腰缠万贯，而我们由于坚持放电影，收入微薄。不怕大家见笑，我这套西服是来京前借的。我们的一些发了财的亲友劝我们“另立门户”，并答应提供方便，我们回答：干了15年了，扔掉怪可惜的，我们都是党员，不能让电影事业在岛上荒废。
    每到渔汛旺季，渔民晚上9点才归岛，我们只得晚上10点以后放电影，我们都成了夜猫子。
    这几年岛上渔民钱多了，要花大钱办喜事，我们主动上门，动员乡亲改大操大办为包场电影请亲友，既热闹又节省，放映前还用幻灯打字幕：“某某同志喜结良缘，放电影请亲友，祝新郎新娘相亲相爱，同心协力劳动致富。”大家都拍手叫好，这一些作法渐成风气，促进了渔村精神文明建设。
    四川煤田地质公司135队放映技师晏长辉：
    我从煤矿学校毕业到地质队后，看到地质队员文化生活贫乏，1972年改行放电影，现在承担我们全队12个点的放映任务，每个月都要把这分布在9个县（区）的12个点跑一遍，总有25天不在家过。儿子出生了，我半个月后才见到。
    地质队的驻地多在山区，有电视也收不到，大家都盼着看电影，我白天赶路夜里放电影，从这个点转到那个点有时要步行六七个小时，还要自己背机器、幕杆。放电影17年，我步行了1万多公里路。
    我们的机器不比大城市电影院安好不动，而是要露天放，要带着翻山越岭，我按月维修保养三套设备，1957年以来使用的长江54型放映机，至今完好无损，连每个机箱角都没坏，这17年间场场优质，点点安全。
    幕布是我们放映员的脸面，我的两块幕布每月都自己刷洗，用到旧还是洁白的。
    青海省都兰县香日德镇放映员赵克卿：
    我1957年从河南老家来到青海，1974年自愿到香日德组建电影放映队。这个乡面积1.3万平方公里，平均海拔3500米，年均气温摄氏2.7°，近两万人口，居住分散。全乡15个放映点，从一个点到另一个点最少要用半天功夫，最远的要走两天。
    我们乡蒙古、藏等少数民族占30％以上，我除组织放映民语译制片外，还插话解说，帮助农牧民看懂电影。
    自从有了电影队，许多农牧民平生第一次看上电影，摸着银幕不愿离去，问我电影的奥秘。每当电影放完后，牧民们争先恐后将我往自家帐篷拉，献上哈达，倒上奶茶，敬上美酒，这时我心里热乎乎、乐滋滋的。
