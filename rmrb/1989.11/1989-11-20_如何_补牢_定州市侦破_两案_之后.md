Since last September, Defangzhou City in Hebei Province has consecutively uncovered two major economic crime cases:

One is the Wen Gaiping fraud case. This illiterate peasant woman, Wen Gaiping, consecutively defrauded 24 units of over 7.4 million yuan, bribing up to 860,000 yuan. Including a deputy director of the city's Public Security Bureau, 20 state cadres and staff members became her captives in the face of money, and were arrested by law as criminals.

The other is the case of Zhang Jincai, former member of the Standing Committee of the Defangzhou Municipal Party Committee and deputy mayor, who extorted and accepted bribes. During his term, Zhang Jincai extensively extorted and accepted bribes. Only 46 bankbooks were seized from his home, amounting to 1.4 million yuan, along with a large quantity of premium cigarettes and liquor. Seven co-defendants were detained, and three have been arrested.

The harsh reality has made the Defangzhou Municipal Party Committee alert. After careful consideration, they believe that corruption is rampant and corrupting the cadre ranks, mainly due to three reasons: first, the party organization is lax in management, with the party not managing the party and the problem of weakening party discipline being widespread; second, the promotion and use of cadres emphasize talent over morality, and the system of organizational assessment and public supervision is not sound; third, discipline is lax.

Based on the above reflections, the Defangzhou Municipal Party Committee decided to strictly govern the party. They used the two major cases as negative examples to organize over 11,000 party members and cadres across the city to discuss and connect with reality, guiding everyone to understand the importance of strengthening the study of Marxist theory, strengthening self-reform of thoughts, and establishing the idea of serving the people under the conditions of reform and opening up. Since this year, the Municipal Party Committee has, on the basis of thoroughly rectifying 1,036 grassroots party organizations and removing 630 corrupt elements, earnestly implemented the democratic evaluation of party members, the "three meetings and one class" system, the life meeting system for members of party committees at all levels, the cultivation and examination system for active party members, and the supervision system for party members and cadres at all levels. In the promotion and use of cadres, the Municipal Party Committee has seriously drawn lessons from the past, strictly implemented the system of democratic recommendation and organizational assessment, and collective discussion by the party committee. According to the "four modernizations" standard and the prescribed procedures, a batch of morally and professionally competent young and middle-aged cadres have been selected to serve as leaders of various districts, townships, and departments, strengthening the construction of leading cadres at all levels.

To plug the loopholes that lead to corruption, the Municipal Party Committee and Government have formulated a series of systems and regulations to strengthen clean governance. They have extended the "two opennesses and one supervision" system from municipal departments and units to all 5 districts, 3 offices (sub-district offices), 49 townships, and 505 villages across the city, respectively formulating and improving clean governance regulations and measures suitable for their own departments and localities.

Defangzhou City has also thoroughly cleaned up the "small treasuries" of various departments and units across the city, handing over more than 27 million yuan of off-budget funds to the financial department for unified management, thus cutting off the sources of public funds for eating and drinking, purchasing state-controlled commodities, and issuing bonuses and gifts.

To improve the supervision network, all administrative bureaus and districts, townships, and towns across the city have established supervision agencies and assigned full-time supervisors. The Municipal Party Committee, Government, and various departments have set up reporting hotlines and reporting boxes, encouraging the public to report on the corrupt issues of cadres at all levels. At the same time, it is stipulated that the handling results of all named and direct reports will be notified to the reporters. By the end of October, of the 730 cases of illegal and disciplinary violations handled across the city, including 18 major cases, the vast majority were reported by cadres and the public. The public has seen the effectiveness of reporting, increasing their trust in reporting and supervision. Under the deterrence of the two courts' notices and public supervision and reporting, by October 31, 39 people who have committed embezzlement and bribery have surrendered.

To further implement various clean governance systems, to bring the work of party and government organs and cadres into the track of law-abiding and clean governance, the Municipal Party Committee organized all party and government organs and cadres across the city to carry out the "Strive to Build a Clean Government, Strive to Be a Clean Cadre" activity in earnest. So far, 24 advanced clean governance units and 1,450 advanced individuals have emerged, and a clean governance atmosphere is being formed.

    如何“补牢”
    ——定州市侦破“两案”之后
    李成福
    从去年9月起，河北省定州市接连查出了两起重大经济犯罪案：
    一个是温改平诈骗案。这个目不识丁的农妇，连续诈骗了24个单位的740多万元资金，行贿达86万元，包括该市公安局一名副局长在内的20名国家干部职工在金钱面前成了她的俘虏，成了被依法逮捕的罪犯。
    另一个是原定州市委常委、副市长张金才索贿受贿案。张金才任职期间，大肆索贿受贿。仅在他家查获的存折就有46个，金额14万元，还查获了大量名烟、名酒。同案被收审7人，目前已批捕3人。
    严酷的现实，使得定州市委警觉起来。他们经过冷静思考，认为腐败现象如此猖獗地腐蚀干部队伍，主要有三个方面的原因：一是党组织疏于管理，党不管党、淡化党的纪律问题普遍存在；二是对干部的提拔使用重才轻德，组织考核与群众监督的制度不健全；三是纪律松弛。
    基于上述反思，定州市委下决心从严治党。他们以两起大案为反面教材，组织全市11000多名党员干部联系实际开展讨论，引导大家从中领悟在改革开放条件下加强马克思主义理论学习、加强自身的思想改造和树立为人民服务思想的重要性。今年以来，市委在对全市1036个基层党组织进行认真整顿，清除630名腐败分子的基础上，认真贯彻执行了民主评议党员制度、“三会一课”制度、各级党委成员的生活会制度、入党积极分子的培养考查制度以及对各级党员干部的监督制度。在提拔使用干部上，市委认真吸取过去的教训，严格实行了民主推荐与组织考核、党委集体讨论的制度。按照干部的“四化”标准和规定的程序，选拔了一批德才兼备的中青年干部担任各区、乡和部门的领导，加强了各级领导班子的建设。
    为堵塞产生腐败的各种漏洞，市委、市政府制定了加强廉政建设的一系列制度和规定。并把“两公开一监督”制度从市直机关和单位逐步延伸到了全市5区3办（办事处）49个乡镇及505个村庄，分别制定和完善了适合本部门、本地特点的廉政规定及措施。
    定州市还认真清理了全市各部门、各单位的“小金库”，将2700多万元的预算外资金交出财政部门统一代管，从而断绝了用公款吃喝、乱购国家专控商品、滥发奖金实物的财源。
    为健全监督网络，全市各行政科局和区、乡、镇都设立了监察机构，配备了专职监察人员。市委、市政府及各部门都设立了举报电话和举报箱，鼓励群众对各级干部的不廉洁问题进行检举。同时规定，凡署名举报和直接举报的案件，都将查处结果转告举报人。到10月底，全市所查结的包括18起大案在内的730起违法违纪案件，绝大部分是干部群众检举出来的。群众看到了举报的效果，提高了对举报监督的信任程度。在两院《通告》的震慑和群众监督检举的威慑下，截至10月31日，全市已有39名犯有贪污、受贿罪行的人投案自首。
    为进一步落实各种廉政制度，将党政机关和干部的工作纳入依法守法、廉洁清明的轨道，市委组织全市党政机关和干部扎扎实实开展“争创廉洁机关，争做廉洁干部”的活动。目前已涌现出廉政先进单位24个，先进个人1450名，廉政气候正在形成。
