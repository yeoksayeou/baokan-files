To the east of Chengde city, on the south side of Cangzi Village, there is a prominent mountain. At the base of an ancient pine tree near a cliff, there is a cave entrance. The entrance is about 2.5 meters high, 3 meters wide, and approximately 65 meters long. Since the cave faces east and receives the sunlight first, it is named the Sunrise Cave. Upon entering the cave, in the dim light, one can see some Buddha statues. As one approaches the front, a faint light appears, and suddenly, the view opens up, making one feel relieved and expansive. In front of the cave entrance, there is a large platform of about ten square meters. Ancient pines tower on the side of the platform, and apart from the cave entrance, there is no other way out. However, from the side of the mountain ridge, there is a path that can be climbed, resembling a dragon's back. Below the cave entrance is a sheer cliff, with birds flying low and pheasants singing, making the mountain even more secluded. In the distance, the mist and clouds are vast, and the mountains are layered and towering. In front, there are the Flag Mountain and Drum Mountain, which are particularly magnificent. At the top of the mountain, there is a thin stream flowing down, which can turn into a waterfall during rainy days, resembling the Water Curtain Cave. Above the cave entrance, the words "Heavenly Blessing" are carved into the stone, and there are also inscriptions of "Little Penglai" and "Another Heavenly Realm."

"The Sunrise Cave hides a fairy" is a mysterious allure. Legend has it that when Qin Shi Huang was building the Great Wall, he captured laborers from all over. Eighteen stone masons from Shikuo Gully, to escape the hardship of forced labor, fled to this place and hid. They dug eighteen beds on the ground river inside the cave. After living there for a few years, a young stone mason named Li San returned to the village to gather information and told his wife about the cave's location before returning to the mountains. After some time, Li San's wife came to the Sunrise Cave to visit, and the soldiers followed her footsteps and hid at the cave entrance. When the eighteen stone masons came out of the cave to pick wild fruits, they were ambushed, outnumbered, and fought to the death. Only Li San's wife was left in the cave. Later, she gave birth to a boy who had a body covered in white fur. He made a living by picking herbs to treat the illnesses of the mountain people and was known as an immortal.

In the 44th year of the Kangxi reign, the Sunrise Cave was built and named the Bolyue Temple. It encompasses Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism, truly a comprehensive view; looking out from the cave entrance, one can see vast mountains and clouds, with a magnificent view. Now, for the sake of tourism, the cave walls are adorned with eighteen Luohan statues, and various shrines are set up according to the cave's shape, with statues of the Emperor, the Goddess, the Nine Gods, and the Old Master.

　　朝阳洞
　　刘兰松
    承德市区东的苍子村南侧，有一突起的大山。万丈悬崖处的古松下有一洞口，高约2.5米，宽3米，长约65米。因洞口面东，红日先得，故称朝阳洞。进洞口在微暗中可见一些佛像。当前面露出一线微亮时，便已来到东口处，猛然开朗，气舒心广。洞口前一个十多平方米的大平台展现在眼前，台侧古松参天，除洞口外别无去路。但从旁边山腰上有一条山脊可攀，形如龙背。洞口下是万丈悬崖，群鸟低飞，山鸡鸣唱。越发显得“鸟鸣山更幽”了。远眺，烟云苍茫，层峦叠嶂。前面有旗山和鼓山相亲，异常壮观。山顶有一细流垂下，雨天可成瀑布，犹如水帘洞。洞额镌刻着“洞天福地”四个大字，石上还有“小蓬莱”、“别有洞天”的墨迹。
      “朝阳洞里藏仙子”是一个神秘的诱惑。传说秦始皇修长城时到处抓民夫，石槽沟的十八名石匠，为逃避劳役之苦，逃到这儿躲藏，在洞内的地河上凿了十八铺炕。住了几年以后，一个叫李三的小石匠，回村探听消息，把洞址告诉了妻子，便又回到山里来了。又过了一段时间，李三妻子到朝阳洞来探望，官兵也顺着她的脚印追来了，偷偷埋伏在洞口。十八个石匠出洞去采摘野果时，中了埋伏，寡不敌众，血战而亡。洞内只剩下李三媳妇，后来她生了个男孩，长大后满身白毛，以采药为山民治病谋生，被称为仙人。
    康熙四十四年营建朝阳洞并命名为博阅观。佛、儒、道俱全，可谓博阅；在洞口眺望，苍山云海，气象万千也可谓博阅。如今为了旅游观光，洞壁塑有十八罗汉，并依洞就势设有神祠，供有关帝、娘娘、九神、老君等塑像。
