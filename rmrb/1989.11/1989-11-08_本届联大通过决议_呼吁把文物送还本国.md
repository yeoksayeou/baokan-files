People's Daily, United Nations, November 6th—Correspondent Liu Kai Chen reports: The 44th session of the United Nations General Assembly today passed a resolution by an overwhelming majority, calling on all countries to "return irreplaceable cultural heritage to their countries of origin."

This draft resolution was proposed by Burundi and 17 other countries. China and 139 other countries voted in favor, with no opposing votes. The United States, Britain, France, Japan, and 12 other Western countries abstained.

The resolution states that the return of a country's artworks, historical artifacts, various treasures, documents, manuscripts, and other cultural or artistic treasures can help strengthen international cooperation and preserve and promote world cultural values through effective cooperation between developed countries and developing countries.

As early as the 28th session of the UN General Assembly in 1973, Zaire had requested a discussion on the return of stolen artworks, hoping that artifacts lost due to colonial rule or foreign occupation could be returned to their rightful owners.

    本届联大通过决议
    呼吁把文物送还本国
    本报联合国11月6日电　记者刘开宸报道：第44届联合国大会今天以压倒多数通过一项决议，呼吁世界各国“把无法替代的文化遗产送还本国”。
    这项决议草案是由布隆迪等17国提出的，中国等139国赞成，无反对票，美、英、法、日等西方16国弃权。
    决议指出，归还一国的艺术品、历史文物、各种珍品、文献、文件、手稿和其它文化或艺术珍品，有助于在发达国家和发展中国家的有效合作下，加强国际合作、保存并发扬世界文化价值。
    早在1973年第28届联大期间，扎伊尔就要求讨论归还各国被掠夺艺术品问题，希望由于殖民统治或被外国占领而遗失的文物能物归原主。
