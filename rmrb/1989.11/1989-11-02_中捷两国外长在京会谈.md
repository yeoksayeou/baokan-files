The foreign ministers of China and Czechoslovakia held talks in Beijing today, expressing their willingness to seek new areas of cooperation based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and to advance the relationship between the two countries in politics, economics, culture, and other fields.

The talks between Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Czechoslovakian Foreign Minister J. Jahn were held at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. During the talks, both sides briefed each other on their domestic political and economic situations and exchanged views on the international situation and bilateral relations. Both foreign ministers expressed satisfaction with the development of Sino-Czechoslovakian relations in recent years, noting that significant achievements have been made.

In discussing the international situation, they shared many similar views. They both believe that the overall trend in the current international situation is shifting from confrontation to détente, and that the two countries should make positive efforts to promote this trend.

At the same time, they also pointed out that there are still unstable factors in the international arena.

Qian Qichen said that certain reactionary forces in the international community are always trying to seize opportunities to oppose and even overthrow the socialist system. Socialist countries should remain vigilant.

Qian Qichen expressed China's hope for stability and development in Europe. He praised Czechoslovakia's achievements in socialist construction and its contributions to maintaining peace in Europe and the world.

He thanked the Czechoslovakian Party and government for their understanding and support of China's actions to quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion in early June.

After the talks, the two foreign ministers signed a cooperation agreement between the two countries' foreign ministries.

Jahn arrived in Beijing this morning at the invitation of Qian Qichen for an official visit to China.
