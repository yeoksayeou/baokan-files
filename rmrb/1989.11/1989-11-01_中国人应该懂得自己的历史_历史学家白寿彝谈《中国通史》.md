In 1974, scholars from the field of history in Pakistan told the visiting renowned Chinese historian Bai Shouyi that past world histories were all centered around the West, with little mention of the East. Now, they said, it is time to talk about the East, to talk about the Chinese civilization behind the Himalayas. They hoped to see a comprehensive history of China written by historians from New China.

Fifteen years have passed, and the first volume of "A Comprehensive History of China," edited by Bai Shouyi, has finally been published. This comprehensive history is planned to be 12 volumes, 42 books, and 12 million words, consuming more than ten years of effort from Bai Shouyi and his collaborators. It is expected to be basically completed by the end of next year. The reporter came to congratulate him upon hearing the news. The 80-year-old Bai Shouyi smiled meaningfully and recounted this small detail from his visit to the neighboring country.

The heart of a historian spans thousands of years and tens of thousands of miles, filled with a deep affection for the motherland.

This professor from Beijing Normal University introduced that in the past, "A Comprehensive History of China" had not truly been continuous, neither vertically nor horizontally, which was regretted by the academic community. Both Fan Wenlan and Guo Moruo had written comprehensive histories. Fan Wenlan's first comprehensive history had the characteristic of focusing on classical studies, rhetoric, and Buddhism, especially the Tang Dynasty, which was particularly well-written. This book, after revision, was rich in content and vivid in language, making it engaging to read. However, Fan Wenlan's comprehensive history was written before liberation, mainly to expose the darkness of the ruling class. After liberation, Fan Wenlan himself felt dissatisfied, feeling that what was discussed were only the dark sides of Chinese history. He wanted to revise it, but he did not complete the revision before he passed away. Guo Moruo's comprehensive history mainly covered the pre-Qin period. In 1975, Bai Shouyi, with a strong sense of historical responsibility, first proposed to compile a truly continuous "A Comprehensive History of China," which immediately received the support of the Party Committee of Beijing Normal University and the responsible comrades of the State Publishing Bureau. Experts and scholars from the academic community, archaeological community, and scientific community responded enthusiastically.

The task of compiling a 12-volume "A Comprehensive History of China" is immense and arduous. More than 70 experts and scholars participated in this work. To speed up the writing process, the first editorial meeting was held in 1979. After that, the compilation work gradually unfolded.

While considering the format and other issues of the multi-volume "A Comprehensive History of China," Mr. Bai decided to first focus on writing "An Outline of Chinese History" to clarify his views on some major issues in Chinese history, thus preparing the necessary theoretical foundation for the multi-volume comprehensive history. In 1980, "An Outline of Chinese History" was published, and it was subsequently translated into English, Japanese, and Spanish. This book, combining scientific rigor with accessibility, was aimed at general Chinese readers and foreign readers. Within a few years, it was published domestically in over 800,000 copies and was consecutively awarded the first prize for popular political theory literature in 1983 and the excellent textbook award in 1988. Its sequel, "An Outline of Chinese History: Continuation," was also published in 1987.

Many historians at home believe that from the content of these two books, Chinese history has begun to be continuous. Bai Shouyi explained that by "continuous," he meant clarifying the intricate internal connections of China's thousands of years of history. Although it is only an outline, it signifies vertical continuity, from the Peking Man to 1949; horizontal continuity, covering politics, economy, culture, science and technology, ethnic relations, and Sino-foreign relations.

Mr. Bai gave an example, saying that China is a multi-ethnic country. To write a continuous "A Comprehensive History of China," one must value the role of the Han ethnicity in Chinese history while also respecting the contributions of various ethnic minorities. The ethnic relations in history sometimes had friendly interactions as the main theme, and sometimes conflicts and wars as the main theme. These are all partial phenomena of different historical periods. Mr. Bai believes that one should see the relationship between Chinese ethnicities from the entire process of historical development. Regarding the economic and cultural backwardness of ethnic minority regions, Mr. Bai believes this is due to natural and historical conditions. We should see the contributions of ethnic minorities in developing the frontier and defending the motherland under difficult natural conditions; we should also see that the harsh conditions in many ethnic minority areas are unimaginable to the interior.

Professor Bai told the reporter that although the multi-volume "A Comprehensive History of China" can be said to be continuous, this continuity is still very limited, and the understanding is not yet complete. He looks forward to the criticism of experts and the general readers.

His assistant Liu Xueying introduced that the task of compiling the multi-volume "A Comprehensive History of China" is very arduous. The organizational coordination and writing workload are both large, the duration is long, the draft writers and special draft writers are scattered across the country and often change, making it truly difficult. But these difficulties were overcome one by one with everyone's joint efforts. In particular, Mr. Bai paid a great deal of hard work, which can be described as heart-rending.

Bai Shouyi is the true chief editor of the entire book. From organizing 13 editorial groups to discussing and formulating the outlines of each volume, he personally participated or presided over them. To strengthen the connection and coordination between the volumes, he personally presided over the editing of "A Comprehensive History of China: Editorial Communication," frequently communicating and discussing difficulties with the chief editors of each volume. He personally reviewed the manuscripts of each volume, sometimes even rewriting them. In the 12 volumes, he personally edited two volumes. For the work of the comprehensive history, he often worked day and night. Mr. Bai's eyes are highly myopic and are in the mature stage of cataracts, almost losing his sight. But with astonishing willpower, he asked his assistant to read repeatedly and insisted on working. Later, he underwent cataract surgery. Even during the hospitalization period for the surgery, he never stopped the work on the comprehensive history. When reviewing the manuscripts, he was meticulous to the point of being strict. Whenever he encountered historical material issues, he would painstakingly verify them... Clothes gradually loosen but he does not regret, for her, he has become thin. From him, we once again feel the rigorous scholarly spirit of Chinese intellectuals.

Mr. Bai revealed that this work is actually the completion of Premier Zhou's instructions. In 1972, Zhou Enlai proposed that a "A Comprehensive History of China" should be written for Chinese youth. Zhou Enlai believed that today's youth do not understand history and that they should be educated to know Chinese history.

Mr. Bai emotionally told the reporter: "History is an important course in ideological education. Chinese people should understand their own history. People can gain enlightenment from history, such as how to be a person, how to treat the country, how to treat the traditions of the Chinese nation, and how to observe the future, etc. By understanding Chinese history, people will love today's motherland and the socialist system even more, and will be more diligent and striving in the cause of modernization construction."

    中国人应该懂得自己的历史
    ——历史学家白寿彝谈《中国通史》
    张儒　格来
    1974年，巴基斯坦史学界的朋友对来访的中国著名历史学家白寿彝谈到，过去的世界通史均以西方为中心，东方不怎么讲；现在要讲东方，要讲喜玛拉雅山背后的中国文明。他们希望看到新中国史学家自己编写的中国史书。
    15年过去了，白寿彝先生主编的《中国通史》第一卷终于推上了书架。这部通史预计12卷、42册、1200万字，耗费了白先生和他的合作者们十余年的心血，将于明年年底基本完成。记者闻讯前来祝贺，80高龄的白先生微微一笑，意味深长地讲述了当年出访西邻的这个小细节。
    史学家的胸怀，上下几千年，纵横几万里，盛满了对祖国的执着情意。
    这位北京师范大学教授介绍，过去《中国通史》一直没有真正贯通，纵不通，横也不通，史学界引以为憾事。范老、郭老都编写过通史。范文澜的第一部通史很大的特点是讲经学、辞章，讲隋唐佛教，尤其隋唐讲得好。这部史书经过修改内容丰富，文笔生动，读起来引人入胜。但是，范老这部通史是解放前写的，主要是揭露统治阶级的黑暗。解放后，范老自己也感到不满意，觉得所讲的都是中国历史的阴暗面。他想修改，但是没修改完，就辞世了。郭老的通史，主要写的是先秦。1975年，白寿彝先生以强烈的历史责任感，首倡编撰真正纵横贯通的《中国通史》，立即得到北师大党委和国家出版局负责同志的支持，史学界、考古界、科技界的专家学者望风而应。
    12卷本的大型《中国通史》工程十分浩大、艰巨。仅参加这项工作的专家、学者有70多人。为加快编写工作，1979年，召开了第一次编写会议。此后，编撰工作便逐步展开了。
    在酝酿多卷本《中国通史》编著体例等问题的同时，白先生决定先突击编写《中国通史纲要》，对中国历史上的一些重大问题阐明自己的观点，这就为多卷本通史在理论上做了必要的准备。1980年，《中国通史纲要》出版，随后被译成英、日、西班牙文。这本书以中国一般读者和外国读者为主要对象，科学性与通俗性相结合，数年之间，国内发行80多万册，先后被评为1983年全国政治理论通俗读物一等奖和1988年全国优秀教材奖。这本书的续编《中国通史纲要续编》也于1987年问世。
    国内许多史学家认为，从这两本书的内容上看，中国通史开始通了。白寿彝先生解释说，所谓通，就是把中国几千年的历史上下左右错综复杂的内在联系讲清楚。虽然只是个提纲，但它意味着纵向贯通了，从北京猿人一直写到1949年；横向也通了，就是政治、经济、文化、科技、民族关系、中外关系各个侧面通了。
    白先生举例说，中国是一个多民族的国家，要把《中国通史》写通，既要重视汉族在中国历史上的作用，也要尊重各少数民族在中国历史上的贡献。历史上的民族关系，有时以友好为主，有时以矛盾、战争为主，这都是不同历史时期的局部现象。白先生认为，应从历史发展的全过程中看到中国民族间的关系，对少数民族地区经济文化的落后，白先生以为，这是由于自然条件和历史条件造成的。我们应看到少数民族在困难的自然条件下，开发边疆及捍卫祖国的功劳；还应看到，少数民族区域不少地方的艰苦情况是内地难以想象的。
    白教授向记者表示，多卷本《中国通史》虽然可以说写通了，但这个通，还是很有限的，认识还未完结。他期待着专家和广大读者的批评。
    他的助手刘雪英介绍说，编撰多卷本《中国通史》的任务十分艰巨。组织协调和编写的工作量都很大，延续时间长，撰稿人、特约撰稿人散居各地且时有变动，真是困难重重。但这些困难在大家的共同努力下一一克服了。尤其白先生付出了大量辛勤劳动，可以说是呕心沥血。
    白寿彝先生是全书的名副其实的主编。从组织13个编写组，到讨论、制定各卷的编写大纲，他都亲自参加或主持。为了加强各卷之间的联系和协调，他又亲自主持编写《中国通史编撰通讯》，经常与各卷主编通信联络、讨论疑难。他亲自审阅各卷书稿，有时还动笔修整。在12卷中，他本人主编的有两卷。为了通史的工作，他经常夜以继日。白先生的眼睛高度近视，又处在白内障成熟期，几近失明。但他以惊人的毅力，请助手反复诵读，坚持工作。后来，他做了白内障摘除手术。即使在手术住院期间，他也从未把通史的工作停下来。审稿时，他认真到了苛刻的地步。凡遇到史料问题，他都不惮其烦地去核实……衣带渐宽终不悔，为伊消得人憔悴，从他身上，我们又一次感到中国知识分子严谨的治学精神。
    白先生透露，这项工作实际上是完成周总理的嘱托。1972年，周恩来曾提出，要写一部《中国通史》给中国青年们看。周恩来认为，现在的青年不懂得历史，要教育他们知道中国的历史。
    白先生深情地对记者说：“历史是思想教育的一门重要课程。中国人应该懂得自己的历史。人们可以从历史中得到教益。如做一个什么样的人，如何对待国家，如何对待中华民族的传统，如何观察未来等等。了解了中国历史，人们会更加热爱今天的祖国，热爱社会主义制度，更加努力奋发地从事现代化建设事业。”
