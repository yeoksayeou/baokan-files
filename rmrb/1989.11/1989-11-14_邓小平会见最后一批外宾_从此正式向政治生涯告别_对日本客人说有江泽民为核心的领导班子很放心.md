Deng Xiaoping today morning met with the 1989 Japan-China Economic Association delegation in the Great Hall of the People. Deng Xiaoping told the Japanese guests, including Saito Eijiro and Kawai Yoshikazu, "I would like to use this opportunity to officially bid farewell to my political career. Your delegation is the last formal delegation I will be meeting. When retiring, one must truly retire and not make it difficult for the new leadership to work."

He said, "This time, I will retire one hundred percent. I will no longer represent the collective, the Party, and the state to meet guests, truly embodying retirement. In the future, if some old friends come to China, it might be impolite not to meet them. I can visit the guests' residence to talk about friendship and non-political matters. I will not interfere, allowing the Party, government, and military leaders to work freely. This is very necessary for their growth and work."

Deng Xiaoping praised Jiang Zemin, the General Secretary, as "a very capable person." He said, "As an intellectual, he has more knowledge than I do, although his experience is less. But experience can be cultivated. He is only 63 years old this year. I am very confident with this leadership team."

Deng Xiaoping told the Japanese guests that China's policies and development strategies over the past decade will not change.

He said, "Yesterday, Jiang Zemin and Li Peng explained to you the significance of rectification and adjustment. Rectification and adjustment are for better progress. In the past period, our economic construction was too fast, a bit lacking in momentum, but we do not regret it. We have indeed ascended a step, not a small step, but a big step. Our strategic goal is to proceed in three steps."

Deng Xiaoping emphasized that China needs to develop, requiring an international environment of peace and cooperation, and domestic stability. He said, "If there is chaos, nothing can be accomplished." He urged the nation to "further do a good job in education, especially in discipline and patriotism education."

When talking about Sino-Japanese cooperation, he said, "The cooperation between the two countries has a deep foundation, and this cooperation should be sustained for the long term. Our policy of Sino-Japanese friendship will not change. Japan should reflect on itself and not be arrogant; China should be strong and not be inferior. Only in this way can friendship and cooperation be eternal."

Deng Xiaoping thanked the Japanese friends present for their efforts in developing Sino-Japanese friendly cooperation.

The highest advisor of the delegation, Saito Eijiro, praised Deng Xiaoping for his significant contributions to China and the world's development, and for his enthusiasm for the country and the people's cause even after leaving his leadership position. Saito also emphasized the importance of Sino-Japanese friendship.

At the end of the meeting, Deng Xiaoping asked Saito to convey his greetings to Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki upon his return to Japan.

The delegation, with Saito Eijiro as the highest advisor and Kawai Yoshikazu as the leader, visited China. Zheng Hongyi, the president of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, attended the meeting.

The meeting lasted for more than an hour. The hosts and guests had a sincere and friendly conversation.

    邓小平会见最后一批外宾  从此正式向政治生涯告别
    对日本客人说有江泽民为核心的领导班子很放心
    本报北京11月13日讯　记者孙毅报道：邓小平同志今天上午在人民大会堂会见了1989年度日中经济协会访华团。邓小平同志对斋藤英四郎、河合良一等日本客人说：我想利用这个机会，正式向政治生涯告别。你们这个团是我见的最后一个正式的代表团。退就要真退，不要使新的领导感到工作困难。
    他说：这次我要百分之百地退下来。我今后不再代表集体、党和国家见客人，要体现真正退休。今后有些老朋友来中国，可能不见不礼貌。我可以去客人住地拜访，谈友谊，谈非政治性的事情。要让党、政、军领导放手工作，我不插手。这对他们的成长和工作很有必要。
    邓小平同志赞扬江泽民总书记“是一个很有本领的人。”他说：作为知识分子，他比我知识多，当然经验比我差一些，但经验是可以锻炼出来的。他今年只有63岁。有这个领导班子我很放心。
    邓小平告诉日本客人，中国10年来制定的方针、政策不会变，发展战略没有变。
    他说，昨天江泽民、李鹏向你们解释了治理、整顿的意义。治理、整顿是为了更好地前进。前一段我们经济建设搞得太快，有点后劲不足，但我们不后悔。我们毕竟是上了一个台阶，不是迈了一小步，而是一大步。我们的战略目标是分三步走。
    邓小平强调，中国要发展，要国际和平环境和合作，要国内不乱。他说，一乱什么也搞不出来。他要求在全国“进一步做好教育工作，特别是纪律教育、爱国主义教育。”
    在谈到中日合作时他说，两国合作具有深厚的基础，这种合作要长期坚持下去。我们对中日友好的方针不会改变。日本要自省，不要自大；中国要自强，不要自卑。只有这样，友谊才是永恒的，合作才是永恒的。
    邓小平感谢在座的日本朋友为发展中日友好合作关系做了很多工作，尽了很大努力。
    访华团最高顾问斋藤英四郎赞扬邓小平为中国和世界的发展作出了很大贡献，赞扬他离开领导岗位后对国家和人民的事业还是满腔热情。斋藤还强调了中日友好的重要性。
    会见结束时，邓小平请斋藤先生回国后转达他对海部俊树首相的问候。
    访华团以日本经济团体联合会会长斋藤英四郎为最高顾问、日中经济协会会长河合良一为团长。中国贸促会会长郑鸿业参加了会见。
    会见进行了一个多小时。宾主进行了诚挚、友好的交谈。
