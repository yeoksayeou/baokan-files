The sea is advancing, the coastline is receding, and vast tracts of land are being swallowed up; tens of millions of people will have to leave their homes and migrate… These people are the "ecological refugees" of the 21st century who have not yet been born.

This is not an alarmist exaggeration. Although since the last Ice Age, the Earth's temperature has only risen by 4°C, in recent times, especially since the Industrial Revolution, the Earth's temperature has risen significantly faster. Scientists, based on the current rate of temperature increase on Earth, predict that from now until the middle of the next century, the global temperature may rise by 2-5°C. Do not underestimate this seemingly small temperature increase; it is enough to cause the melting of polar ice caps, leading to a rise in sea levels. Calculations show that if the sea level rises by 1 meter, seawater will cover 30% of Tokyo's land area; if the sea level rises by 2 meters, one-quarter of Bangladesh's land and large areas of Egypt will become marshes, and low-lying countries like the Maldives and Seychelles will disappear from the map. — According to predictions, a large number of coastal residents, accounting for 30% of the world's total population, will be directly affected by the sea, and the total number of "ecological refugees" will exceed 300 million!

The main culprit behind the rapid rise in Earth's temperature is the increasing amount of carbon dioxide that causes the greenhouse effect. The large increase in carbon dioxide is due to the extensive use of mineral fuels, agricultural chemicals, and freon in refrigerators, etc. Of course, the large-scale deforestation and burning of tropical rainforests in areas like the Amazon and Congo basins, which play an important role in balancing various components in the atmosphere, are also significant reasons for the increasing amount of carbon dioxide.

Currently, the United Nations Environment Programme is working to coordinate the relevant industrial policies of various countries, urging major industrial countries to reduce the use of energy sources that pollute the environment as much as possible, and promoting various new technologies and products that are harmless to the environment. The 12 countries of the European Community recently held a meeting to study and formulate a set of "green measurement units" that all countries must follow — that is, to ban the use of chlorofluorocarbons that destroy the Earth's ozone layer and strictly limit the emission of harmful car exhaust gases. The irresponsibility towards the ecological environment has already caused great losses to humanity. A research report from the European Community points out that pollution alone causes losses equivalent to at least 6% of the annual output of industrialized countries. It is no wonder that the increasingly dire ecological environment has attracted the strong attention of people of insight around the world, who are proposing solutions.

Protecting the Earth, on which we depend for our existence, is a sacred responsibility of all humanity. By taking precautions and working together, we can make the prediction that "ecological refugees will appear in the mid-21st century" a false alarm, just a sky-falling fable.

### 但愿是杞人忧天——关于“生态难民”的预言

    但愿是杞人忧天
    ——关于“生态难民”的预言
    海水在进逼，海岸线在退缩，大片陆地被吞噬；数以千万计的人民只好背井离乡……那些人是今日尚未出生的21世纪的“生态难民”。
    这并非是危言耸听的不实之词。尽管自上次冰川时代迄今，地球气温只上升了4℃，可是近世，尤其是工业革命以来，地球气温上升显著加速。科学家依据目前地球温度升高势头推断，从现在起至下世纪中叶，世界气温可能比现在升高2—5℃。可别小觑了这区区几度的温升，它足以引起极地冰山的融化，从而导致海平面升高。计算表明，海平面若升高1米，海水将漫过日本东京都30％的地面；海平面若升高2米，孟加拉国的1／4土地，埃及的大片面积则成一片泽地，马尔代夫、塞舌尔等洼地与岛国将从地图上被抹去。——据预测，广大沿海地区在内的占世界总人口30％的居民将直接遭受海水之害，全部“生态难民”将逾3亿之众！
    引起地球气温急速升高的罪魁祸首是酿成温室效应的数量激增的二氧化碳。二氧化碳的大量增加则是由于大量使用矿物燃料、农用化学药剂以及电冰箱中的氟里昂等，当然，像对大气中各种成分有重要制衡作用的亚马孙河、刚果河流域等地的热带雨林遭大规模砍伐、焚烧也是二氧化碳日益增多的重要原因。
    目前，联合国环境规划署正在努力协调各国的有关的工业技术政策，要求主要工业国家尽量减少使用污染环境的能源，设法推广对环境无害的各种新技术与新产品。欧洲共同体12国最近开会研究制定了一个各国均需遵守的所谓“绿色的测量单位”——即禁用会破坏地球臭氧层的氯氟碳化合物，并严格限制汽车有害尾气的排放。对生态环境的不负责已经造成了人类的极大损失。欧洲共同体的一份研究报告指出，仅污染造成的损失至少相当于工业国家每年产值的6％，难怪生态环境的愈益险恶已引起全世界有识之士的强烈关注，纷纷提出解决办法。
    保护我们赖以生存的地球是全人类的神圣责任，未雨绸缪，共同努力，让“21世纪中叶将出现生态难民”的预言有惊无险，只是杞人忧天罢了。　　　　　　　（程荣逵）
