Mexico's Telephone Company is the largest state-owned enterprise in the country. In 1967, the company's total number of telephones first exceeded one million units. By early 1988, this number had reached eight million units.

If we calculate based on Mexico's population of 80 million at the time, this means that there are ten telephones for every 100 people. However, if the goal of reaching 35 million telephones by the year 2000 is achieved, and the population increases to over 100 million, then there will be 30 telephones for every 100 people. To achieve this goal, from now until the end of the century, Mexico's Telephone Company must complete a massive task: installing at least 2.06 million telephones per year over the next twelve years. This will undoubtedly be a daunting task for the company.

The development of Mexico's telecommunications industry has not been smooth. In 1982, Mexico experienced a financial crisis that severely impacted the development of the telecommunications industry. In September 1985, a strong earthquake hit Mexico City, temporarily disrupting Mexico's communications with the outside world. Due to a series of difficulties, the company's services fell behind, and the quality of service also declined significantly. Since the 1980s, the development speed of Mexico's Telephone Company has been hampered, with the growth rate of the total number of telephones dropping from an average of 12% to 6%. In 1987, the company restored its 12% development speed, marking a turning point. To achieve the goal of installing 1.5 million lines in the coming years, the company must also make significant investments.

How will Mexico's Telephone Company overcome the challenges it faces to improve services and achieve modernization? First, the company emphasizes localization and the establishment of regional telephone centers, aiming to achieve higher levels of economic efficiency, efficiency, and service. In 1987, 118 new automatic telephone exchanges were opened, the capacity of 265 telephone exchanges was expanded, and 112 buildings were constructed for new telephone exchanges. The company's modernization began in 1980, with the completion of a digital telephone exchange that year. In 1983, the digital telephone network was put into use and accounted for 12% of the total number of telephones in the country. It is expected that by the year 2000, digital telephone networks will reach 80%. In 1985, the telephone company began using Mexico's Morelos satellite, and in the same year, began using container technology for mobile broadcasting stations, improving their effectiveness. By 1987, the total length of optical fiber cables in Mexico's Telephone Company had reached 469 kilometers.

Secondly, the telephone company has decided to participate as a partner in the laying of the "TAT-9" submarine optical fiber cable, which is scheduled to be put into use in 1991. This cable will connect the Americas and Europe, further improving the current satellite lines.

Additionally, Mexico's Telephone Company aims to socialize telephones, caring for users with limited economic means, and providing services for public telephones in towns and remote rural areas. To date, 300 digital public telephones have been installed. To expand telecommunications services in rural areas, the company also uses multi-functional wireless technology. For this purpose, the Inter-American Development Bank has provided $25.9 million to the company for the construction of basic infrastructure.

Mexico's Telephone Company has stated that in the coming years, they will continue to add new services to meet societal needs.

    墨西哥电话事业迅速发展
    周小妹
    墨西哥电话公司是国内最大的国营企业，一九六七年该公司的电话总数首次突破一百万台，到一九八八年初已达到了八百万台。
    如果按目前墨西哥人口八千万计算，那么就是每一百人拥有十台电话，但到二○○○年如果实现电话总数三千五百万台的目标，人口增至一亿多的话，那时每一百人就将拥有三十台电话。为达此目标，从现在起至本世纪末，墨西哥电话公司必须在今后十二年内进行巨大的工作，即每年至少得安装二百零六万台电话。这对墨电话公司来说，无疑将是一个艰巨的任务。
    墨西哥的电话事业发展并不是一帆风顺的。一九八二年墨西哥爆发金融危机严重影响了电话事业的发展，一九八五年九月墨西哥首都又遇强烈地震并一度使墨西哥同外界的联系中断。由于一系列的困难，曾致使该电话公司服务落后，质量也严重下降。进入八十年代以来，墨电话公司的发展速度一度受挫，电话总数的增长率以平均百分之十二降至百分之六。一九八七年，墨西哥电话公司恢复了百分之十二的发展速度，成为转折性的一年。为了在今后若干年里安装一百五十万条线路的目标，该公司还必须进行大量的投资。
    墨电话公司如何战胜面临的困难以改进服务和实现现代化的呢？首先，公司强调地方化和建立地区电话中心，并使其产品在经济效益、效率和服务上达到更高的水平。一九八七年又新开设了一百一十八个自动电话局，扩大了二百六十五个电话局的能力，并且为新开的电话局盖了一百一十二幢楼。该公司的现代化是从一九八○年开始的，并在当年建成了数控电话局，一九八三年数控电话网络开通使用并占国内电话总量的百分之十二，预计到二○○○年，数控电话网络将达百分之八十。一九八五年电话公司开始使用墨西哥的莫莱洛斯的卫星，同年开始将集装技术用于活动式广播电台，使其效果更佳。一九八七年，墨西哥电话公司的光导纤维电缆总长达四百六十九公里。
    其次，电话公司已决定以一个合作者的身份参与海底“TAT—9”光导纤维的电缆铺设工作，该电缆将于一九九一年投入使用，它将把美洲和欧洲联结起来，从而使目前使用的卫星线路更趋完善。
    另外，墨电话公司以电话的社会化为目的，关心经济能力小的用户，为城镇和偏远农村公共电话提供服务，迄今为止，已安装了三百台数控公共电话。为了扩展农村的电话事业服务，该公司还应用多功能无线电技术。为此，泛美开发银行向该公司提供了二千五百九十万美元用于基础结构的建设。
    墨西哥电话公司表示，在今后几年中，他们还将增加新的服务项目，以满足社会的需要。
