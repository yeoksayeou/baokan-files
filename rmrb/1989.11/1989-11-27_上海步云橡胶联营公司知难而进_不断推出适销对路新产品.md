Shanghai Buyun Rubber Joint Venture Company Faces Challenges and Continues to Launch Market-Friendly New Products

    The People's Daily, Shanghai - Reporter Zhang Shihong reports: In the face of challenges such as capital shortages and a sluggish market, enterprises that know how to face difficulties head-on, accelerate product structure adjustments, and continuously launch new products can quickly expand the market and overcome difficulties. This is the basic experience of Shanghai Buyun Rubber Joint Venture Company's success.

    This joint venture company, led by Shanghai Buyun Rubber Shoe Factory, is composed of 10 enterprises and is the largest rubber shoe group in China. The "Buyun" brand rubber shoes are renowned worldwide for their good quality, new styles, and reasonable prices. Despite the sluggish market this year, orders from various levels of wholesale stations and large and small stores across the country continue to pour in. Due to commercial capital shortages and excessive arrears, the company faced difficulties in capital turnover, which temporarily caused a drop in production. However, production has gradually returned to normal since September. The company's tax and profit contributions for this year are expected to reach 5 million yuan. Exports have also surged, with expected foreign exchange earnings of 5 million US dollars for the year.

    During an interview, Buyun Company General Manager Yang Shaozhen told the reporter: "The current market sluggishness is temporary. The fundamental issue is that the enterprise's products are not strong enough. As long as we continuously launch high-quality new products, we can overcome difficulties, turn defeat into victory, and there will be no market sluggishness problem." This is indeed the case. This year, the company has launched several new products, such as high-end sports shoes, basketball shoes, table tennis shoes, soccer shoes, and rain-resistant shoes, which have been popular among young people. In August, they launched the latest product, "warm shoes," which were sold out within a day during a trial sale at Shanghai Hua Lian Department Store. Currently, they have received orders for 800,000 pairs, with high demand. The company prioritizes the trial production of new products, often sending large teams to understand consumer needs and preferences. At the same time, they import the latest equipment from abroad and use the latest technology to break the old production pattern. For example, the "warm shoes" that were an instant hit are a first in China.

    The Buyun Company has worked hard to open up sales channels. Through years of effort, they have established 3,520 sales points in 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, forming a nationwide sales network. Therefore, new products can be quickly promoted nationwide. Yang Shaozhen said: "We never give kickbacks to stores, but stores are willing to promote our products. First, it's because of the product quality and reputation, and second, it's because of the reasonable prices, which are profitable for the stores." Each joint venture shoe factory has established a strict quality inspection network and guarantees quality with credibility. If a product is of poor quality, it will be refunded or exchanged. Once, due to poor quality of raw materials, the company publicly apologized in the newspaper and fully refunded and exchanged the affected batch of shoes without hesitation. In terms of pricing, they adhere to the principle of thin profits and high sales volume. Some shoe enterprises only have a profit of one or two jiao per pair, and even the latest product, "warm shoes," only has a profit of nine jiao per pair. They never arbitrarily raise prices. This reputation has spread abroad. The largest shoe company in the United States has placed a large order. Currently, they are establishing sales outlets abroad.

    Shanghai's famous businessman Yang Shaozhen was known as the "rubber shoe king" before liberation. With 50 years of experience, his theory is: "Every enterprise must face storms, and difficulties will bring new vitality to the enterprise. Enterprises should use the current opportunity to thoroughly rectify internal issues, improve management, enhance adaptability, and improve enterprise quality. In this way, the situation will quickly change. Otherwise, even if the objective conditions improve, you will still be the same old face and old pattern, and the enterprise may not have vitality. In the fierce competition among the more than 30,000 rubber shoe factories in the country, failure is inevitable." This is precisely the vision that contemporary entrepreneurs should have.

### 上海步云橡胶联营公司知难而进　不断推出适销对路新产品

　　上海步云橡胶联营公司知难而进
　　不断推出适销对路新产品
    本报上海电　记者章世鸿报道：面对资金短缺、市场疲软等困境，企业只要知难而进，加快调整产品结构，不断推出新产品，迅速开拓市场，必能度过难关。这是上海步云橡胶联营公司取得成功的基本经验。
    这家联营公司，是以上海步云胶鞋厂为龙头，由10个企业组成的我国最大的胶鞋集团。生产的“步云牌”胶鞋，以质量好、款式新、价格公道而闻名于世。今年以来，尽管市场疲软，在各级批发站和全国大小商店前来要货者仍不断。由于商业资金短缺，欠款过多，使其资金周转困难，一度造成生产下降。但9月份后，产量逐步恢复正常。该公司今年上交税利预计可达500万元。出口更是激增，预计全年创汇可达500万美元。
    步云公司总经理杨少振接受采访时告诉记者：“眼前市场疲软是暂时的，根本问题是企业的产品不过硬。只要不断打出过硬的新产品，必能克服困难，转败为胜，不存在疲软问题。”事实确是如此。今年，该公司打出多种新产品，如高级运动鞋、篮球鞋、乒乓鞋、足球鞋、防沾雨鞋，一直盛销不衰，受到广大青年喜爱。8月份，他们又打出最新产品“保暖鞋”，在上海华联商厦试销，100双鞋一天内抢购一空。目前收到订货单已达80万双，供不应求。公司把试制新产品放在头等地位，经常大批派人出去了解消费者需求和爱好。同时，向国外买进最新设备，采用最新工艺，打破老的生产格局。如一炮打响的“保暖鞋”，为我国首创。
    步云公司在打开销售渠道上狠下功夫。通过几年努力，目前已在全国30个省市区建立3520个销售点，形成全国性销售网络，因而新产品可以很快向全国推广。杨少振说：“我们从不给商店回扣，但商店乐于推销，一是靠产品质量和信誉，二是靠价格公道，商店有利可图。”各联营鞋厂都建立严格的质量检验网，并以信誉担保，凡质量不好的保退保换。有一次，因原材料质量差造成质量事故，公司登报公开道歉，对这批鞋全部退回掉换，毫不含糊。在价格上，他们坚持薄利多销，有的鞋企业只有一、二角钱利润，即使最新产品“保暖鞋”每双也只有9角利润，从不借故乱提价。这种信誉已传播到国外。美国最大的鞋业公司前来大批订货。目前，他们正在国外建立销售网点。
    上海著名工商业者杨少振，解放前号称“胶鞋大王”。积50年之经验，他的理论是：“每个企业都要经受风浪，困难将给企业带来新的生机。企业应利用目前转机大力整顿内部，改善经营，提高应变能力，提高企业素质。这样形势将会很快转变。否则，客观条件即使改善了，你还是老面孔、老格局，企业也未必会有生气，在全国3万多家胶鞋厂激烈竞争中难免失败。”这正是当代企业家应有的眼光。
