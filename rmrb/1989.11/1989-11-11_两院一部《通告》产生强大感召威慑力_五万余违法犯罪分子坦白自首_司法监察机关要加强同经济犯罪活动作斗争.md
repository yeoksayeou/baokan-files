Influenced by the notices from the two courts and the supervision department, a large number of lawbreakers and criminals have chosen to confess and surrender. By the deadline set by the two notices on October 31, a total of 36,171 criminals had surrendered to the procuratorial organs, involving a direct crime amount of 350 million yuan. Additionally, 17,600 people voluntarily confessed to issues of embezzlement and bribery to various levels of administrative supervision organs, involving an amount of 116 million yuan and some foreign currency.

This information was announced at a press conference held today by the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Supervision Department.

According to the introduction, among the more than 36,000 people who surrendered to the procuratorial organs, 70% were involved in embezzlement and bribery, with more than 10% of the crime amounts exceeding 100,000 yuan. There were 9,363 Party members, 742 county-level and division-level cadres, 40 bureau-level cadres, and 1 vice-ministerial-level cadre. Among those who confessed to issues of embezzlement and bribery to various levels of supervision organs, more than 10% involved amounts exceeding 100,000 yuan. There were 679 county-level and division-level cadres and 21 bureau-level cadres.

Meanwhile, 9,457 detained criminals confessed their crimes within the deadline set by the notices and exposed 65,400 pieces of case information.

The implementation of the two notices has recovered a significant amount of economic losses. Currently, the procuratorial organs at various levels have received 209 million yuan in confiscated money and goods. The administrative supervision organs at various levels have received 7.6 million yuan in confiscated money, along with a large number of confiscated items such as cars, motorcycles, color televisions, video recorders, audio recorders, and gold jewelry.

According to the introduction, after the issuance of the notices from the two courts, the procuratorial organs received more than 230,000 pieces of information from the public, which is more than double the amount from the same period last year. The number of tips received by the supervision organs at various locations has generally increased by 2 to 3 times compared to the same period before the notices were issued.

During the implementation of the notices, the people's courts at all levels across the country accepted a total of 10,039 cases of economic crimes such as embezzlement, bribery, and speculation from the procuratorial organs, and sentenced 8,250 cases, involving 12,461 criminals. Among them, 3,715 were given lighter sentences, and 1,595 were given heavier sentences. The supervision organs at various levels gave lenient treatment to 2,616 people who voluntarily confessed and reported their problems, with 1,841 of them being exempted from administrative penalties.

The heads of the Supreme Court, the Supreme Procuratorate, and the Supervision Department pointed out at the press conference that currently, economic crimes such as embezzlement, theft, bribery, and speculation for excessive profits, especially the embezzlement and bribery by some state workers and the speculation crimes by some units, are still rampant. These activities have caused significant economic losses to the state and collectives, severely damaged the image of the Party and the state, disrupted the economic order, corrupted social ethics, and affected social stability. Therefore, these criminal activities must be severely punished by law.

They stated that after the expiration of the notices, the judicial organs and supervision organs will strengthen their fight against economic crimes. Those who hesitated and did not surrender during the notice period can continue to confess and surrender. For those who surrender and perform meritorious service, they will be treated leniently by law.

    两院一部《通告》产生强大感召威慑力
    五万余违法犯罪分子坦白自首
    司法监察机关要加强同经济犯罪活动作斗争
    据新华社北京11月10日电　（记者周立宪）在两院《通告》和监察部《通告》的感召和威慑下，一大批违法犯罪分子走上自首坦白的道路。到两个《通告》规定的期限10月31日为止，全国共有36171名犯罪分子到检察机关投案自首，直接涉及犯罪数额3.5亿元；17600多人到各级行政监察机关主动交代贪污受贿问题，涉及金额1.16亿多元和一些外币。
    这个情况是最高人民法院、最高人民检察院、监察部在今天联合召开的新闻发布会上介绍的。
    据介绍，到检察机关投案自首的3.6万多人中，贪污受贿者占70％，犯罪数额在万元以上的超过10％；党员9363人，县处级干部742人，厅局级干部40人，副部级干部1人。到各级监察机关交代贪污、受贿等经济问题涉及金额在万元以上的也超过10％。县处级干部679人，厅局级干部21人。
    与此同时，9457名在押犯也在《通告》规定的期限内坦白交代了自己的罪行，并检举揭发出65400条案件线索。
    两个《通告》的贯彻执行挽回了一大笔经济损失。目前已退交到各级检察机关的赃款赃物折款20900万元。到各级行政监察机关退交的赃款有7600多万元，另外还有小汽车、摩托车、彩电、录像机、录音机、金首饰等一大批赃物。
    据介绍，两院《通告》发布后检察机关受理群众的举报线索23万多件，比去年同期增长两倍以上。到各地监察机关举报的线索普遍比《通告》发布前同期增加2至3倍。
    全国各级人民法院在《通告》贯彻执行期间，共受理检察机关起诉的贪污、受贿、投机倒把等经济犯罪案件10039件，判处8250件，共判处案犯12461人，其中从轻判处3715人，从严判处1595人。各级监察机关对2616名主动坦白交待问题的给予宽大处理，其中免予行政处分的1841人。
    高法、高检和监察部负责人在新闻发布会上指出，当前，贪污盗窃、行贿受贿、投机倒把牟取暴利等经济犯罪活动，特别是少数国家工作人员贪污、受贿和少数单位的投机倒把犯罪活动仍很猖獗，给国家、集体造成重大经济损失，严重损害了党和国家的形象，扰乱了经济秩序，败坏了社会风气，影响社会安定。因此，对这些犯罪活动必须依法严惩。
    他们表示，《通告》到期以后，司法机关和监察机关将加强同经济犯罪活动作斗争。在《通告》期间犹豫不决没有投案自首的经济犯罪分子，以后可以继续自首坦白，对于投案自首和立功者，将依法从宽处理。
