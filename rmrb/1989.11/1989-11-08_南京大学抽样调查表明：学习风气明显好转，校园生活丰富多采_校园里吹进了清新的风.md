The editorial department of the *Nanjing University News* recently conducted a sample survey of over 8,000 students at the university. The results indicate that the academic atmosphere has significantly improved, campus cultural life remains rich and diverse, and students' spiritual outlook has changed for the better. Many students are rethinking their values and reshaping themselves, and some have even submitted applications to join the Communist Party. At the same time, they have identified several issues that need attention, primarily focusing on optimizing the educational environment and improving the educational mechanism.

The survey found that the learning atmosphere is becoming increasingly strong, with fewer students engaging in games like chess and cards, and almost no one playing mahjong. Over 90% of students attend evening self-study sessions, with many staying up late to read. Nanjing University has eight makeshift rooms dedicated for students to study at night. On regular nights, nearly 300 students stay up until midnight to read, and even on weekends, about 150 students continue to study until midnight. Out of the 200 questionnaires collected from night-study students, 137 (68%) regularly study until midnight, 162 (81%) read professional books, 100 (50%) read foreign language books, and 120 (60%) view night study as a pursuit.

The survey also shows that campus cultural activities have become lively again, with various forms such as singing, films, and seminars. Weekend dances, karaoke singing contests, new student general knowledge competitions, screenings of revolutionary tradition films, and economic issue discussion forums have attracted hundreds of participants.

Students' spiritual outlook has undergone significant changes, especially among the 110 students from the Basic Science Department who underwent military training. Since returning to school, they have consistently attended morning exercises, and the sound of morning exercises, which had been silent for over 20 years, has returned to the campus.

After two months of concentrated study on the documents of the Fourth Plenum, many students have become more self-aware and mature, beginning to reshape themselves in thought and action. In early October, a large-scale "Reshape Yourself" series of activities was launched among new students, aiming to guide each new student to establish the correct direction for university life, which was welcomed by many students. According to the spirit of the notice from the State Education Commission, eight newly enrolled graduate students in the Philosophy Department went to the Nanjing Second Machine Tool Factory for a year of internship as soon as they started school. They felt they learned a lot from the workers and are planning to hold a philosophy lecture for the factory's cadres and workers. About 20 university students, in their self-reflection, have strengthened their faith in the Party and submitted applications to join the Party. Just in the Chinese Department, seven students have submitted party membership applications. These students have sincere intentions and practical actions. In the recent voluntary blood donation activity, over 1,000 students from the fourth year voluntarily signed up to donate blood.

The numbers tell us a comforting fact. However, the survey also revealed that while the trend of disinterest in learning has improved, a small number of students still play chess and cards; although the school has repeatedly emphasized the rules, some students still engage in business activities; there are also instances of violating school rules and regulations; and some students still have vague understandings of the turmoil in the spring and summer of this year.

All these indicate that improving and strengthening ideological and political work, optimizing the school's educational environment, and perfecting the educational mechanism are still long-term tasks.

    南京大学抽样调查表明：学习风气明显好转，校园生活丰富多采
    校园里吹进了清新的风

    《南京大学报》编辑部最近对本校8000多学生进行抽样调查，结果表明：学风已有明显好转，校园文化生活依然丰富多采，学生精神面貌有改观。不少学生在反思中重塑自我，还有的写了入党申请书。与此同时，他们也发现一些值得注意的事情，主要集中在优化育人环境、健全育人机制上。
    调查发现，学习风气日渐浓厚，玩棋、牌的明显减少，搓麻将的几乎很少看见。晚自习的人数在90％以上，不乏“挑灯夜读”者。南京大学有八间简易平房，专供同学们夜读用，在平时，几乎每天都有300来人读书到夜里12点，即便是周末晚上，也仍然有150来人经常看书到夜里12点。在回收到的200份夜读同学的问卷中，经常坚持看书到“0”点的有137人，占68％；其中看专业书的有162人，占81％；看外语书的100人，占50％；把夜读当作一种追求的有120人，占60％。
    调查表明，最近一段时间，校园文化又热闹起来了，有歌曲、有影视、有研讨会，形式多样、各取所求。周末舞会、卡拉OK歌曲赛、新生百科知识竞赛、革命传统影片汇演、经济问题探讨会等，吸引了几百人参加。
    学生精神面貌有很大转变，特别是经过军训的基础学科强化部110位学生，回校后至今坚持出早操，销声匿迹20多年的出操声又在校院内响起来了。
    经过两个多月的集中学习四中全会文件，不少同学在反思中清醒、成熟，开始从思想上和行动上重塑自我。10月初在新同学中开展的“重塑自我”大型系列活动，旨在让每一个新生建立起大学生活的正确导向，受到许多同学欢迎。根据国家教育委员会通知精神，哲学系有8位新录取的研究生，一开学就到南京第二机床厂实习一年。他们深感从工人中学到不少东西，几个人正在合计着为厂里的干部职工办一个哲学讲座。有20几位大学生在反思中坚定了对党的信仰，递交了入党申请书，仅中文系就有7位同学交了入党报告。这些同学既有真诚要求，又有实际行动，在最近的义务献血活动中，仅四年级就有1000多同学主动要求献血。
    数字告诉我们的事实是令人欣慰的。但在调查中我们也发现，厌学风虽有好转，依然有极少数人在玩棋、牌；虽然学校三令五申，可仍有个别同学在经商；违反校纪校规的也时有发生；特别是对今年春夏之际的动乱，有些同学存有模糊认识。
    所有这些都告诉我们，改进和加强思想政治工作，优化学校的育人环境，健全育人机制，仍是一项长期的工作。
