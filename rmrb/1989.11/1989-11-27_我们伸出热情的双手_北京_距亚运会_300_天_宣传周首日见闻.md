On November 25th, Beijing enjoyed clear weather. Signs and slogans such as "Only 300 days until the Asian Games!" and "The Asian Games bring glory to the country, I contribute to the Asian Games!" were everywhere. The people of Beijing kicked off the "300 Days Until the Asian Games" promotional week with a variety of colorful activities.

At the northern suburbs athletics field of the Asian Games, 2,000 young people sang the volunteer song for the Beijing Asian Games, "We March Towards the Asian Games." Li Xicong, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Mayor Chen Xitong, and Wu Shaozu, Director of the State Sports Commission, attended the inaugural ceremony of the 11th Asian Games Volunteer Corps held there. When Chen Xitong presented the yellow, white, and green tricolor flag of the Volunteer Corps to the commander, Jiang Wei, the loudspeaker echoed with passionate voices: "Green symbolizes our hard work for the Asian Games; yellow symbolizes the bountiful harvest of the Asian Games; white symbolizes the pure and beautiful hearts of our volunteers. The three colors represent the 3 million young people of Beijing. The hand in the center of the flag holding the Asian Games emblem symbolizes our warm and friendly hands welcoming Asian friends and our personal contributions to the Asian Games..."

After the brief inaugural ceremony, 25,000 volunteers began their environmental improvement duties around the Asian Games Village. The high-flying flags of the Communist Youth League, schools, factories, and the military, along with the Volunteer Corps flag, shimmered under the blue sky.

At the front gate of the city and on Wangfujing Commercial Street, staff of the Asian Games Foundation were promoting and selling foundation lottery tickets to passersby: "Extend your hands, show your concern for the Asian Games"; "One ticket, one heart"; "Many hands make light work." Around them, famous athletes such as Chen Longcan, Xu Yanmei, Xiong Ni, Huang Xiaomin, Deng Yaping, and Cai Yan Shu, as well as actors like Wu Yuhua, Liu Lili, Xu Min, and Hu Shijie, were busy signing autographs for the crowd buying lottery tickets. Hands, young and old, reached out, "I'll buy ten yuan," "I'll buy five yuan"; more people understood the profound meaning of the whole nation caring for and contributing to the Asian Games.

At the Beijing Workers' Club, a special cultural performance focused on promoting the Asian Games, infusing the audience with the spirit of the Asian Games through music and dance.

In the conference room of an airline company, the experience-sharing meeting on excellent service for the Asian Games allowed people to learn from each other and improve, just 300 days before the Asian Games.

At one bus stop after another, the "Fight the Cold, Ensure Winter Transport, Excellent Service for the Asian Games" activity made the voices of many ticket sellers sound even sweeter.

Tomorrow, the people of Beijing will continue with even more colorful activities, expressing their sincere participation and enthusiasm in hosting the Asian Games with more heartfelt voices and vibrant colors...

　　我们伸出热情的双手
　　——北京“距亚运会300天”宣传周首日见闻
    11月25日北京天气晴好。“距亚运会只有300天！”“亚运为国添光彩，我为亚运做贡献”等标牌口号随处可见。北京人以丰富多彩的活动，拉开了“距亚运会300天”宣传周的序幕。
    在亚运会北郊田径场，两千名青少年引吭高唱北京亚运会义务服务人员之歌——《我们走向亚运会》。中共北京市委书记李锡铭、市长陈希同、国家体委主任伍绍祖等，参加了在这里举行的第十一届亚运会义务服务人员总队成立大会。当陈希同将黄、白、绿三色相间的义务服务人员总队队旗授予总队长强卫时，扩音器中传出了充满激情的声音：“绿色，象征着我们为亚运会辛勤的耕耘；黄色，象征着亚运会将取得丰硕的成果；白色，象征着我们义务人员纯洁美好的心灵。三种颜色，代表了北京市300万名青少年，队旗中间一只手托起亚运会会徽，象征我们伸出热情友谊的双手欢迎亚洲朋友，并将亲手为亚运会做出贡献……”。
    简短的成立大会结束后，25000名义务人员在亚运村周围开始了治理环境的义务劳动，高高飘扬的团旗、校旗、厂旗、军旗……与义务服务总队队旗在蓝天下交相辉映。
    在前门箭楼下、在王府井商业街上，亚运会基金会的工作人员正向过往行人宣传销售基金奖券：“伸出您的双手，献上一份对亚运会的关注”；“一张奖券一颗心”，“众人拾柴火焰高”。在他们的身边，著名运动员陈龙灿、许艳梅、熊倪、黄晓敏、邓亚萍、蔡炎书，电影演员吴玉华、刘莉莉、徐敏、胡世捷……正埋头为购奖券的群众签名。一双双稚嫩的、年轻的、苍老的手伸了过来，“我买十元”，“我买五元”；更多的人们则从这里领悟到全民关心亚运会，为亚运会做贡献的深刻含义。
    在北京工人俱乐部，一台以宣传亚运会为主要内容的专题文艺节目，用乐曲和舞姿把亚运会意识注入了观众脑中。
    在航空公司会议室，迎亚运优质服务竞赛经验交流会，使人们在距亚运会只有300天的时候，得以相互学习、取长补短；
    在一个又一个公共汽车站，“战严寒保冬运优质服务迎亚运”活动，使不少售票小姐的嗓音似乎变得更加悦耳甜润；
    明天，北京人将以更加丰富多彩的活动，更加多情多义的声音和色彩，向世人表明他们参与筹办亚运会的一片诚心、一片热情……　新华社记者　李莉
