Reflection on Reflection
Li Gengchen

The reflection we are talking about now refers to looking back and thinking, which is somewhat similar to self-reflection, self-examination, and summarizing experiences and lessons. In real life, people actually reflect quite often, especially after a storm, they cannot help but reflect. If one does not reflect at all, fails to learn from setbacks, one will never become wiser.

However, while everyone reflects, their approaches vary. In history, Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty reflected on the lesson that "the Sui Dynasty lost the mandate of heaven because it rejected advice," and thus did the opposite. He not only advocated "listening to both sides makes one clear-sighted" but also put it into practice, establishing the institution of remonstrance officers who were specifically tasked with pointing out flaws. This led to the achievement of the "Zhenguan Reign." On the other hand, King Zhou of the Shang Dynasty read the "Book of Xia" and laughed at the downfall of the Xia Dynasty. He reflected, but instead of learning from the mistakes of King Jie of Xia, he surpassed them in indulgence, creating wine pools and meat forests, leading to the ruin of his country and his own demise. Even more bizarre was Emperor Xiao Yi of the Southern Dynasty Liang, who, when the enemy was at the city gates and imminent collapse was near, reflected and concluded that "reading ten thousand books is still not enough." Instead of organizing resistance, he busied himself burning books. Fourteen million volumes of ancient and modern books were burned to ashes. This confused fool became more confused the more he "reflected," almost driving himself mad.

Nowadays, everyone talks about reflection, and everyone is reflecting, but the approaches vary greatly. One comrade, reflecting on the origin of the turmoil, sharply criticized "opening up has gone wrong," saying that "without opening up, filth and dirt would not have come in, people's minds would not have been confused, and there would not have been this turmoil." This is almost like Xiao Yi, reflecting in the wrong way. Who doesn't know that reform and opening up are like opening a window in a closed room, allowing us to see the outside world and let in fresh air? Why not do it? Closing the country and shutting out the world is like closing one's eyes and ears, how can one make rapid progress? Comrade Deng Xiaoping said that reform and opening up are correct, "without reform and opening up, how could we have today?" This is the truth. "If anything, it is that reform and opening up are not enough," how can there be a "wrong opening"? The thinking goes awry, the more one reflects, the more one goes astray. Of course, most people can reflect correctly. My friends around me have reflected on "reflection" and feel that there is a major direction that should not be deviated from.

Firstly, reflection requires a historical perspective. One must think both horizontally and vertically. If one only thinks horizontally and not vertically, only thinks about today and not the past and future, then one knows only one side and not the other; knows only the surface and not the essence; knows only that our economy is still relatively backward, but does not know that our development speed is among the fastest in the world, and the future is bright. Everything has a development process and cannot be separated from certain time and space conditions. To expect to reach the sky in one step or achieve success in one go is like a madman's dream. If one sees others' butter bread and complains that one's own steamed bread has no flavor, forgetting that yesterday one could only eat husk and wild vegetable cakes, one is easily discouraged. To reflect without considering certain historical and environmental conditions, one is easily detached from reality, losing the premise of correct thinking, and is likely to lose one's way.

Secondly, reflection requires a dialectical viewpoint. One must analyze specific situations and not simply affirm everything that is good or deny everything that is bad; when hot, it is like sitting in a steamer, when cold, it is like lying on ice. To affirm or deny everything simply, using rigid and unchanging thoughts to look at problems, are all metaphysical. They are the roots of many errors. As for reform and opening up, establishing new concepts does not mean abandoning good traditions. The Four Cardinal Principles, hard work, ideological work, patriotism, and so on, how can one ever abandon them? Moreover, learning advanced production management from the West, how can one import their harming others for personal gain, mutual deception, and even AIDS? Opening windows allows fresh air to come in, which is better than a closed pot; but the flies and mosquitoes that come in are carriers of diseases, so one must install a screen to filter them. If one does not think of this, but instead loves flies and mosquitoes, or even does not open windows but "tears down the house," negating the Four Cardinal Principles, will there not be problems? Conversely, if one finds that flies and mosquitoes have come in, instead of using a fly swatter or spraying insecticide, one blames the window for being opened wrongly and wants to seal it again to recreate a closed pot, is that not foolish and weak? When a child is dirty, one should bathe them, but if one pours out the dirty water and the child together, is that not absurd? "From this to that, from the surface to the essence, removing the coarse and retaining the fine, removing the false and retaining the true," this is a saying, but for many people, whether they can use it well in a lifetime is a big question.

In summary, reflection should overcome one-sidedness, summarize historical experiences and lessons, promote the good and criticize the bad, so as to avoid detours in the future and advance faster. This should be the essence of reflection.

    反思之思
    李庚辰
    我们现在说的反思，是指返回头来思索，与反省、自省、总结经验教训庶几相近。在实际生活中，人们其实是经常反思的，尤其一场风波过后，更不免要反思一番。压根儿不反思，吃堑不长智，就永远不会变得聪明起来。
    然而反思人人有，思路却各不同。历史上，唐太宗反思出“隋以拒谏失天下”的教训，便反其道而行之，不仅主张“兼听则明”，还落实行动，开创谏官制度，设专人专门挑刺，从而实现了“贞观之治”。而“纣读《夏书》而尝笑其亡国”，反思倒也反思了，却不仅不能由夏桀而鉴恶，反而有过之无不及，酒池肉林，骄奢淫逸，闹得国破身亡。更有奇的，南朝梁元帝肖绎，在兵临城下行将灭亡时，反思的结果，却认为是“读书万卷，犹有今日”。城都快破了，他不去组织抵抗，却忙着烧书，古今图书十四万卷，一把火烧个精光。这个糊涂蛋越“思”越糊涂，简直走火入魔。
    眼下也是人人说反思，个个在反思，但各自思路如何，怕也是千差万别。有位同志反思风波起源，疾言厉色指责“开放开糟了”，说是“没有开放，就进不来污泥浊水，人心就不乱，便不会有这场风波”，这就迹近肖绎，“思”入邪门了。谁人不知，改革开放，犹如闷室开窗，既看清了外部世界，又流进了新鲜空气，何乐不为？而闭关锁国，犹之闭目塞聪，怎能捷足快步？邓小平同志讲改革开放“没有错”，“没有改革开放，怎么会有今天？”这才是至理。“要说不够，就是改革开放得还不够”，哪有“开糟”之理？思路一拧，越反思越背劲。自然，能正确反思的人还是大多数，我周围的朋友对“反思”作了反思，觉得有个大的思路不可偏离。
    首先，反思要有历史眼光。凡事纵横交思，倘是只“横思”，不“纵思”，只“思”今天，不“思”往昔与未来，那就知其一，不知其二；知其表，不知其里；只知我们今天经济还比较落后，不知我们的发展速度举世靠前，前程一片光明。任何事物都有一个发展过程，都离不开一定的时空条件。指望一步登天，一蹴而就，无异痴人说梦。如果看到别人的牛油面包，就嫌弃自己的白面馍没味道，忘记了昨天还只能啃糠菜窝窝头，就容易灰心泄气。离开一定的历史条件、环境条件谈反思，就容易脱离实际，失去了正确思维的前提，难免迷失方向。
    二曰反思要有辩证观点。凡事要具体分析，不可好就一切皆好，坏就一切皆坏；热起来热得蒸笼里坐，冷起来冷得冰凌上卧。简单化地肯定一切或否定一切，用静止不变的僵化思想看问题，都是形而上学，它是导致许多错误的根苗。就改革开放而言，树立新观念，不等于抛弃好传统。四项原则，艰苦奋斗，思想工作，爱国主义，如此等等，怎能须臾离开？再者，学习西方先进生产管理，怎能将其损人利己，尔虞我诈乃至艾滋病一并引入？开窗子可进新鲜空气，比闷葫芦好；可进来的苍蝇、蚊子却是病菌媒体，这就要安个纱窗，加以过滤。倘不思此图，却偏爱苍蝇蚊子，甚至不是开窗子，而是“扒房子”，否定四项基本原则，那还不出毛病？反之，如果发现进来了苍蝇、蚊子，不是拿起蝇拍，或喷洒敌敌畏，却是指责窗子开错了，要重新堵死，再造闷葫芦，岂非笨伯、孱头？孩子脏了要洗澡，但倒脏水时连孩子一块倒掉了，岂不荒唐？“由此及彼，由表及里，去粗存精，去伪存真”，话是一句，但对不少人来说，一辈子能否用好，是一个很大的课题。
    总之，反思要克服片面性，总结历史经验教训，好的发扬，坏的批评，以求日后少走弯路，更快前进，这应是反思的正果。
