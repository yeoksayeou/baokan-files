Chahanshan, meaning "salt marsh" in Mongolian, is known as China's Dead Sea and the largest salt lake. I came from the salt-producing region of the Bohai Sea to the Qaidam Basin, eager to see its splendor.

The car left Golmud City, and as we drove across the Gobi Desert, the red willows, saltwort, and desert poplar became fewer and fewer. Beyond the green, there lay Chahanshan. Strangely, although it is called a salt lake, there was not a drop of water in sight. As far as the eye could see, there was only a vast expanse of yellow earth, the landscape resembling a field plowed by a tractor, with large salt crusts scattered everywhere, covered by a layer of white frost. Just as the folk song goes: "The ground does not grow grass, the sky has no flying birds." All that could be seen were the slow-moving, towering dust devils formed by the hot winds, and in the distance, the mirages flickered, as if there were a large harbor with ships sailing in and out, their masts standing tall, tempting one with an illusion that was tantalizingly out of reach.

Where is the salt if the lake is dry? It turns out that these "large salt crusts" are the weathered salt shells. The salt shells are only a few tens of centimeters thick, beneath which lies an immense expanse of crystal-clear brine. Chahanshan Salt Lake covers nearly 6000 square kilometers, with an average depth of 15 meters, and contains 60 billion tons of soluble salt resources. This amount of salt could build a 6-meter-wide and 12-meter-thick silver bridge between the Earth and the Moon. What astonishing figures! I cast my gaze skyward, filled with wonder. In reality, the silver bridge is right here in front of me. The road beneath my feet is made from the local salt crystals, mixed with brine to form a shiny, glittering salt bridge stretching 33 kilometers across the salt lake. This is the famous 33-kilometer-long salt bridge, part of the Dunggar Highway that connects the northwest with Tibet. The buoyancy of the salt lake exceeds imagination. Parallel to the road is a railway line, connecting Xining to Golmud. As I speak, a fast train roars past, its wheels beating a rhythm that makes my heart race, fearing that the railway base floating on the brine might sink.

After leaving the road, I entered a salt production site. The offices and dormitories are all built from salt shells, and the workers call themselves "Crystal Palace" residents. The production method is simple: remove the salt shells to dig a trench, and the brine in the trench is a golden yellow, like brandy. The workers, dressed in rubber suits, stand in the water using a perforated shovel to scoop out the salt. The white, rejuvenated salt is inexhaustible, and the salt mounds on the shore stretch like snow-covered mountains. This method of production naturally has very low costs, and even after accounting for transportation to Hebei and Tianjin, the price is much lower than sea salt. Moreover, sea salt production has a long cycle, requiring the repair of salt fields, water irrigation, and multiple transfers, taking a month or more to produce a single pool of salt, all while relying on good weather. The vastness of our motherland is undeniable, and Chahanshan is a natural treasure. It is just that our modern scientific civilization has not developed quickly enough, keeping such a treasure trove hidden for so long until after liberation, when it began to be gradually developed and utilized.

In addition to sodium salts, the brine of Chahanshan contains rich amounts of potassium, magnesium, boron, bromine, iodine, rubidium, and lithium, among other important elements. Among these, the potassium salt reserves account for 97% of the national total. Potassium is one of the three major nutrients for plant growth, primarily promoting the growth of stems. Our country's soil is generally deficient in potassium, and in 1986, the state invested in building a potassium fertilizer plant here with an annual production capacity of 200,000 tons, which has already begun trial production. The factory buildings and all other structures are green, bringing a sense of vitality to this otherwise desolate yellow landscape.

The mining base of the Qinghai Potassium Fertilizer Plant is an artificial lake dug into the salt shells. The 10-square-kilometer lake is divided into three areas: sodium salt pools, adjustment pools, and light brine pools. The former extracts sodium chloride, while the latter produces potassium oxide, also known as light brine pools. The scenery is enchanting. The sodium salt pools are a greenish hue, like a field of young crops swaying in the wind; the adjustment pools resemble an artist's palette, with colors ranging from milky white to pale yellow, light green, and silver white, as clouds and flowers are reflected in the water, and the sun's rays dance on the surface, creating a sea of flowers. The light brine pools shimmer with gold and yellow, like waves of wheat in May rolling towards the shore. Upon closer inspection, the light brine crystals beneath the water resemble coral, crystal, glass, and icicles, a sea of flowers, incredibly beautiful.

There are also two green boats slowly moving on the lake's surface. This is not the mirage's temptation from earlier, but a real and tangible existence. Two modern salt-harvesting ships, ranked 5th and 6th in the world. The harvesting arms at the bow of the ships, like several green long arms, stir up the mature light brine crystals, which are then sucked into the ship's body through pipes and transported to the factory via long tail pipes. These two ships replace 100 heavy-duty trucks. Watching the young men on the ship, operating the buttons with pride, they seem like gods roaming in a mythical world.

Legend has it that on Mount Kunlun, there is a place called the Jade Pool, where humans and gods meet. The "Records of the Grand Historian" praises it as "its height is over 2,500 li, where the sun and moon hide and reveal their light. On it, there are the Sweet Spring and the Jade Pool." I have seen many lakes in Qinghai, but none of them seem quite right. Only here does the scenery match the mythical and historical descriptions of the Jade Pool.

For millions of years, Chahanshan, this beauty, has been hidden beneath the veil of salt shells, and human eyes have never truly seen her face. Now, with the veil lifted, she reveals her unparalleled beauty, smiling radiantly, illuminating the entire nation...

Chahanshan, a beautiful and mysterious lake.

    察尔汗，神秘的湖
    尧山壁
    察尔汗，蒙语盐泽的意思，被称作中国的死海，最大的盐湖。我从海盐产地的渤海之滨来到柴达木盆地，多想一睹它的风采。
    汽车出格尔木市，戈壁滩上红柳、沙蒿、罗布麻越来越少，绿色尽处就是察尔汗了。奇怪，说是盐湖却滴水不见，一望无限的土黄，地貌像拖拉机翻耕过的田野，遍地大坷垃，又落了一层白霜。正像民谣所传：地上不长草，天上无飞鸟。所见到的，只有干热风形成的顶天立地的旋风柱慢悠悠移动，以及远方蜃气飘忽，仿佛有个规模很大的海港，船只鱼贯，帆樯林立，给人以可望而不可及的诱惑。
    盐湖无水，盐又在哪里？原来这“大坷垃”就是风化的盐壳。盐壳只有几十厘米厚，下面就是浩瀚的晶莹的卤水。察尔汗盐湖近6000平方公里，平均深度15米，可溶盐资源600亿吨，能在地球和月亮之间架设一条6米宽12米厚的银桥。好惊人的数字，我向空中投去神奇的想象。其实银桥眼前就有，脚下的公路就是就地取材，用结晶盐块浇上卤水修成的，亮晶晶的银桥横跨盐湖33公里，是举世闻名的万丈盐桥，是联结西北和西藏的敦格公路的一部分。盐湖的浮力超过想象，与公路平行的还有一条铁路，西宁直达格尔木的，说话间一列快车呼啸而来，车轮的节奏引起我一阵怦怦心跳，生怕那浮在卤水上的铁路基会陷下去。
    下了公路，走进一家原盐场。办公室和宿舍都用盐壳垒成，工人们自称为“水晶宫”。生产方式很简单，剥开盐壳挖一条壕沟，沟里的卤水呈白兰地样的金黄。工人们穿一身胶皮衣裤站在水里用漏铲捞盐，白花花的再生盐取之不尽，岸上盐坨如雪山逶迤。这样生产自然成本很低，加上运费销到河北、天津，价格也比海盐低得多。而且海盐生产周期长，整修盐田，提水灌池，七倒八倒，晒一池盐要个把月，还得赶上好天气。祖国地大物博不容置疑，这察尔汗不是天然的事实吗。只是我们近代科学文明发展不快，让这样一个聚宝盆藏在深闺久未识，直到解放后，才得以逐渐开发利用。
    察尔汗卤水中，除了钠盐以外，还含有丰富的钾、镁、硼、溴、碘、铷、锂等重要元素。其中钾盐贮量占全国的97％，它是植物生长三大养料之一，主要功能是生长秸秆。我国土壤普遍缺钾，国家1986年在这里投资兴建年产20万吨的钾肥厂，已经试车投产。厂房和一切建筑都是绿色的，给这沉寂的土黄带来一派生机。
    青海钾肥厂的采矿基地，是在盐壳上挖出的一个人工湖。10平方公里湖面分三个区域，钠盐池、调解池和光卤池，前者析出氯化钠，后者生成氧化钾又叫光卤池。放眼望去，景色迷人。钠盐池是麦绿色，如满地青苗迎风起浪；调解池如画家的调色盘，从岸边向湖心依次是乳白、鹅黄、浅黛、银白等色，云彩如花倒映水中，阳光似火浮在水面，一片花的海；光卤池溶金溢黄，如五月的麦浪向岸边涌来。仔细看去，水下光卤石晶体，似珊瑚、水晶，像玻璃、冰凌，一片海里的花，漂亮极了。
    湖面还有两艘绿色的游艇缓缓移动，这可不是刚才海市蜃楼的诱惑，而是伸手可及的真实存在了。两艘现代化的采盐船，在世界排号第5第6。船头伸出的收割手，像几只绿色的长臂把成熟的光卤石翻搅起来，通过管道吸进船体，又通过长长的尾巴管道输送到车间里去，两艘船还代替了100台载重汽车。看那船上的小伙子，操纵按钮，洋洋自得，神仙般地傲游在神话世界里。
    传说昆仑山上有瑶池，是人神交会的地方。
  《史记·大宛列传》称赞“其高二千五百余里，日月所相避隐为光明也。其上有醴泉、瑶池”。我在青海高原上看到了许多湖泊，觉着都不大像，唯有这里的境界与神话和史书上的瑶池的形象吻合。
    亿万斯年，察尔汗这个美人隐藏在盐壳的面纱之下，人类的目光一直看不清它的真面目。如今揭开面纱，露出了绝世美貌，灿然一笑，神州生辉……
    察尔汗，美丽而神秘的湖。
