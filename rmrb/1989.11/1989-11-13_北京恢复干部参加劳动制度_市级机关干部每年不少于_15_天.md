The Communist Party of China Beijing Municipal State Organs Working Committee today issued a regulation requiring subordinate units' party organizations to restore the system of cadres participating in collective productive labor and to persist in this system for the long term.

The regulation stipulates that leaders at all levels should take the lead in participating in labor. State organ cadres at the municipal level should participate in labor for no less than 15 days per year, with the exception of those who are sick, disabled, or physically weak.

The forms of labor can be varied, and the labor locations are not limited. Cadres can participate in labor in their respective systems, combining it with their work; they can designate a relatively fixed labor location for fixed-point or team-based labor; they can also organize volunteer labor and participate in social welfare labor.

The regulation requires that cadres learn from the grassroots workers during productive labor, and at the same time, propagate the Party's line, principles, and policies to the grassroots workers. They should also conduct investigations and research related to their work, reflecting the situation at the grassroots level and the opinions and suggestions of the masses. Cadres participating in grassroots labor should eat in the workers' canteens and must not engage in special treatment.

The Beijing Municipal State Organs Working Committee requires subordinate units' party organizations to do a good job of evaluating cadres' labor. The Beijing Municipal State Organs Working Committee will conduct an inspection of the labor situation of bureau-level leaders every half year and will publicize the inspection results.

    北京恢复干部参加劳动制度
    市级机关干部每年不少于15天
    新华社北京11月12日电  中共北京市国家机关工委今天作出规定，要求所属各单位机关党组织恢复干部参加集体生产劳动的制度，并把这项制度长期坚持下去。
    规定要求，各级领导干部要带头参加劳动。市级国家机关干部每年劳动时间不少于15天。病残或体弱不能参加者除外。
    劳动形式可以多种多样，劳动场所不限。可以在分管的系统，结合工作随时参加劳动；可以确定一个相对固定的劳动地点，定点劳动或跟班劳动；也可以组织义务劳动，参加社会公益劳动。
    规定要求，干部在生产劳动中要向基层职工群众学习，同时也要向基层职工群众宣传党的路线、方针、政策，并结合工作实际作调查研究，反映基层情况和群众的意见、建议。干部在基层劳动，一律到职工食堂就餐，不许搞特殊化。
    北京市国家机关工委要求所属各单位机关党组织做好对干部劳动的考核。北京市国家机关工委每半年对局级领导干部的劳动情况进行一次检查，并公布检查结果。
