Shandong Province's special inspection of individual tax payments has uncovered over 200 million yuan in evaded taxes in a single sweep, with 86.5% of this amount already collected.

This tax inspection combined self-inspection by individual businesses with targeted checks by tax authorities. The tax department conducted spot checks on 340,000 key businesses and found that 35% of them had engaged in tax evasion. A total of 1,606 major evaders, each evading over 100,000 yuan, were identified, resulting in the collection of 53.54 million yuan in back taxes and fines.
