The name Ma Yiseng is synonymous with the famous Qiantang River Bridge in China.

Over the course of his 94-year life, this renowned bridge engineer, known both in China and abroad, designed and built countless bridges. In his own words, he built not only "material" bridges but also "spiritual" ones...

In 1921, at the age of 25, Ma Yiseng obtained his Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in the United States. He turned down several lucrative job offers from various companies, driven by the ideals of "science for the nation" and "engineering for the nation," and returned to his homeland across the ocean.

However, what he witnessed was a series of heart-wrenching scenes. On the rivers, lakes, and seas of this ancient civilization, which boasted the "Four Great Inventions," he saw only modern bridges designed and built by foreigners. As a Chinese person and a bridge engineer, Ma Yiseng vowed to make his countrymen proud.

The opportunity finally came. One day in March 1933, while teaching at Beiyang University in Tianjin, Ma Yiseng received a letter from a friend inviting him to lead the design and construction of the Qiantang River Bridge in Hangzhou. Without hesitation, he resigned from his professorship at Beiyang University and went to Hangzhou to serve as the director of the Qiantang River Bridge Engineering Office. At the time, both domestic and foreign experts asserted that building a bridge over the Qiantang River was impossible. But Ma Yiseng, with a patriotic heart determined to make his countrymen proud, worked with the engineering team to overcome the challenges posed by the thick layers of quicksand at the bottom of the Qiantang River using the "pneumatic caisson method." With the lowest cost of 1.6 million US dollars and in just two and a half years, he completed the first modern railway and highway dual-use bridge in China's history, designed and built by Chinese engineers. This marked the end of the era when foreigners monopolized bridge construction in China.

From then on, the name Ma Yiseng became famous alongside the Qiantang River Bridge.

However, no one could have imagined that while Ma Yiseng was using his hands to welcome the birth of this bridge, he was also preparing for its destruction—drilling holes to place explosive charges to blow up the bridge.

After the Lugouqiao Incident in 1937, Japanese imperialism accelerated its invasion of China. Just three months after the completion of the Qiantang River Bridge, Hangzhou fell. To hinder the Japanese advance, on December 25, Ma Yiseng personally lit the fuse and, with tears in his eyes, blew up the bridge that contained so much of his heart and soul.

Being both the designer and builder of the bridge and its destroyer is unprecedented in the history of bridge engineering, both in China and abroad. Here, we see not only a highly skilled bridge engineer, Ma Yiseng, but also a patriotic son of China who loves his country deeply. His deeds in building and destroying the bridge will be recorded in history.

The liberation of Shanghai in 1949 marked the beginning of a new era for Ma Yiseng, who had endured so much hardship. On the 10th day after the liberation, at a ceremony commemorating Engineers' Day, he could not contain his joy and excitement, saying, "We must be engineers of liberation to build a liberated new China." His heart was overflowing with the desire to contribute his wisdom to the construction of New China.

In that same year, Ma Yiseng was invited to attend the first session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing and participated in the grand opening ceremony.

Once, Chairman Mao, in the Huairen Hall of Zhongnanhai, said to Ma Yiseng and other scientists, "You are all intellectuals in the scientific community. Intellectuals are very important. We need to build a new China, and we cannot do without intellectuals."

In the autumn of 1951, Premier Zhou presided over a State Council meeting to discuss the preliminary plans for the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and specially invited Ma Yiseng to participate. Premier Zhou warmly instructed Ma Yiseng, "You have the experience of building the Qiantang River Bridge. I hope you will contribute your efforts to this bridge!"

The trust and expectations of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou greatly inspired Ma Yiseng. With great enthusiasm, he devoted himself to the grand cause of building New China. He participated in the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, served as the head of the structural group for the construction of the Great Hall of the People, one of the "Ten Great Buildings" in the capital, and held positions such as the president of the Beijing Institute of Technology and the director of the Institute of Science of the Ministry of Railways. He worked tirelessly for the construction of New China, making outstanding contributions.

Even during the "Gang of Four" era, when science was severely damaged and intellectuals were persecuted, Old Ma not only invented a four-function calculator but also completed the manuscripts of works such as "Concepts of Mechanics," "Scientific System," "Educational System," and "From the Zhaozhou Bridge to the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge." After the "Gang of Four" was smashed, Old Ma worked even harder. He often said, "I am old, and I must make the most of my time." At over 80 years old, he not only compiled the science essay collections "Advance Collection" and "Wave Collection" but also edited "History of Ancient Chinese Bridge Technology."

As a leader of the China Science Popularization Association, Old Ma also wrote many science popularization articles throughout his life. Chairman Mao, after reading his "Bridge Talk" published in the newspaper in 1963, praised, "Your 'Bridge Talk' is well written! You are not only a scientist but also a literary figure!"

Time flies, and several decades have passed. Unknowingly, Old Ma has reached the age of 90. Looking back on his life, he has no regrets. But there is one thing that he always regrets. That is his lifelong wish to join the Communist Party of China.

As Old Ma once wrote, "In the first half of my life, I prided myself on being 'non-partisan' and 'above politics,' a consistent advocate of 'science for the nation' and 'engineering for the nation,' an old democrat. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, I witnessed the Kuomintang reactionaries launching a civil war, destroying democracy, and kowtowing to imperialism, beginning to realize that only the Communist Party leading the people to revolution could save China."

After the founding of New China, Ma Yiseng proposed the view that "the Communist Party is the chief engineer of building New China," expressing his heartfelt trust in the Party.

In the decades after the founding of the nation, although Ma Yiseng was not a member of the Communist Party, he always regarded joining the Party as his lifelong ideal and pursuit, and he strove to meet the standards of a Party member as much as possible.

In 1962, during a break at the National Science Planning Conference held in Guangzhou, Premier Zhou had a conversation with Ma Yiseng, Zhu Kezhen, and Wu Youxun and other scientists under the shade of a tree.

Someone asked the Premier: Can democrats who have been "pulled out the white flag" apply to join the Party?

"Of course, they can," the Premier replied, pointing to Ma Yiseng and saying to everyone, "But each person's situation is different. For someone like Old Ma with such prestige, it might be more convenient to work outside the Party."

For decades, the Premier's words weighed heavily on Ma Yiseng's heart. He decided to follow the Party's arrangements and be a "Bolshevik outside the Party." But as he grew older, his desire to join the Party became stronger. After careful consideration, he decided to apply to the Party. On November 22, 1985, Old Ma first wrote a letter to his beloved Comrade Deng, expressing his thoughts. Later, he wrote an application to join the Party:

"I am over ninety years old, and the days I can work for the Party are few, but my desire to join the Party grows stronger every day. For this reason, I am applying again, willing to struggle for communism all my life!"

Despite the many hardships he endured over the decades, Old Ma's belief in the Party remained unwavering.

On October 12, 1987, Old Ma's lifelong wish finally came true. The Communist Party of China accepted this new member at the age of 92.

The responsible person from the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, presiding over the admission ceremony, warmly welcomed Old Ma's joining the Party on behalf of the Party organization. He said, "Fifty years ago, Old Ma led the construction of the first railway bridge in the history of the Chinese nation. Over the past thirty years, he has also built a bridge from a patriot to a communist soldier with his actual actions."

Old Ma, moved, said, "Joining the Communist Party of China is my long-cherished wish. This wish is the summary of my life's experience. I will struggle for the cause of the Party and the people all my life."

Struggle, pursuit—this is the epitome of Old Ma's life. As he himself said: "The journey of life is 'rugged more than flat, sometimes deep valleys, sometimes vast waves, fortunately, there are bridges to cross. What is the name of the bridge? It is called: Struggle!"

Although Old Ma has left us forever, the bridges he built remain, and his spirit of struggling tirelessly for the cause of the Party and the people will live on.

　　中国人奋斗之“桥”
　　——记著名桥梁专家茅以升
　　新华社记者　何平　陈雁
    茅以升，这个名字是同中国有名的钱塘江大桥联在一起的。
    在94年的漫长人生旅途上，这位中外闻名的桥梁专家不知设计、建造了多少座桥。用他自己的话说，不仅有“物质”的，也有“精神”的……
                  （一）
    1921年，25岁的茅以升在美国加利基·梅隆理工学院获得博士学位后，谢绝了好几家公司的重金聘请，怀着“科学救国”、“工程救国”的志向，远涉重洋，毅然回到养育他的故土。
    然而，他所目睹的却是一幅幅令人辛酸的景象。有着“四大发明”的文明古国的江河湖海上，看到的都是由外国人设计建造的现代桥梁。作为一个中国人，作为一个桥梁工程师，茅以升立誓一定要为中国人争气。
    机会终于来了。1933年3月的一天，正在天津北洋大学任教的茅以升接到一位朋友的来信，邀请他去主持设计建造杭州钱塘江大桥。于是，他毫不犹豫地辞去了北洋大学教授的职务，赴杭州担任了钱塘江桥工程处处长。当时，国内外都有人断言，在钱塘江上建桥不可能成功。但茅以升怀着一颗为中国人争气的爱国之心，同工程技术人员一道，利用“气压沉箱法”克服了钱塘江底流沙层厚的困难，只以160万美金的最低造价和两年半的时间，就建成了我国近代史上第一座自己设计建造的铁路、公路两用大桥，结束了由外国人垄断中国桥梁建设的历史。
    从此，茅以升这个名字，同钱塘江大桥一起名扬中外。
    但是，谁也不会想到，就在茅以升用双手迎接这座大桥诞生的同时，竟也为这座大桥的坍塌作好了准备——凿好了安放雷管炸桥的洞孔。
    1937年卢沟桥事变后，日本帝国主义加快了侵略中国的步伐。钱塘江大桥竣工不到3个月，杭州沦陷。为了阻滞日军的进攻，12月25日，茅以升亲手点燃了导火索，挥泪炸毁了这座饱含自己心血的大桥。
    既是桥梁的设计建造者，又同时是桥梁的亲手毁坏者，这在古今中外的桥梁史上都是没有过的。这里，我们所看到的不仅是一个有着高超技术的桥梁专家茅以升，更是一位对祖国有着赤诚挚爱的中华赤子茅以升。他那造桥与毁桥的史实，同将载入史册。
                        （二）
    1949年上海解放，对饱经忧患的茅以升来说，标志着一个新时代的开始。在上海解放后第10天的纪念工程师节大会上，他抑制不住内心的喜悦激动地说：“我们要以解放了的工程师，来建设解放了的新中国。”为新中国的建设贡献自己聪明才智之心溢于言表。
    就在这一年，茅以升应邀北上参加了中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议，并出席了隆重的开国大典。
    有一次，毛主席在中南海怀仁堂对茅以升等科学家说：“你们都是科学界的知识分子。知识分子很重要，我们要建设新中国，没有知识分子是不行的。”
    1951年秋的一天，周总理主持召开政务会议，讨论武汉长江大桥筹建方案，特意邀请了茅以升参加。周总理亲切地叮嘱茅以升：“你有造钱塘江大桥的经验，希望你对这座大桥多多出力！”
    毛主席、周总理的信任与期望，使茅以升深受鼓舞。他以极大的热情投身于建设新中国的宏伟大业之中。他先后参加了武汉长江大桥的主持修建，担任过首都“十大建筑”之一人民大会堂建设的结构组组长，并出任过中国交通大学校长、铁道部科学研究院院长等职，为新中国的建设事业呕心沥血，做出了突出贡献。
    即使在那“四害”横行的年代，在科学事业备受摧残，知识分子遭到迫害的恶劣环境下，茅老不仅发明了四位乘除用的计算器，而且完成了《力学概念》、《科学体系》、《教育制度》、《从赵州桥到南京长江大桥》等著作手稿。粉碎“四人帮”后，茅老更是竭尽全力地工作。他不止一次地说：“我年纪大了，必须抓紧时间。”已是80多岁高龄的他，不仅新编了科学小品集《进军集》、《浪花集》，还主编了《中国古代桥梁技术史》。
    作为中国科普创作协会的负责人，茅老一生还撰写了许多科普文章。毛主席读了他写的1963年发表在报纸上的《桥话》后曾赞扬道：“你的《桥话》写得很好！你不但是科学家，还是个文学家呢！”
                  （三）
    星移斗转，几度沧桑。不觉中，茅老已经步入90高龄。回首一生，他问心无愧。但有一事，他始终引为遗憾。那就是自己追求了大半生的夙愿——加入中国共产党。
    正如茅老曾经写道的那样：“我的前半生自诩‘无党派’、‘超政治’，是个一贯崇尚‘科学救国’、‘工程救国’的旧民主主义者。抗日战争胜利后，我目睹国民党反动派发动内战，摧残民主，投靠帝国主义，开始认识到只有共产党领导人民大众起来革命，才能救中国。”
    新中国一成立，茅以升就提出了“共产党是建设新中国的总工程师”的观点，表达了他对党无限信赖的心声。
    在建国后的几十年中，茅以升虽然不是共产党员，但他始终把入党作为自己毕生的理想和追求，并尽量用党员标准要求自己。
    1962年在广州召开的全国科学规划会议休息时，周总理同茅以升、竺可桢、吴有训等科学家在树荫下谈话。
    有人问总理：民主人士中有不少被拔过“白旗”，他们能否申请入党？
      “当然可以。”说罢，总理指着茅以升对大家说，不过，每个人的具体情况不同，像茅老这样有声望的人，留在党外也许更便于开展工作。
    几十年来，总理这番语重心长的话，茅以升始终铭记在心。他决心听从党的安排，做一名“党外的布尔什维克”。但他随着自己日益年迈，要求入党的愿望也越来越强烈。他经过慎重考虑，决定向党提出申请。1985年11月22日，茅老首先给敬爱的邓大姐写了一封信，表达了自己的想法。尔后，又提笔写下了入党申请书：
    “我已年逾九十，能为党工作之日日短，而要求入党之殷切愿望与日俱增。”“为此，特再次提出申请，愿为共产主义事业奋斗终身！”
    几十年的风风雨雨，茅老虽几经磨难，但对党的信念却始终如一，矢志不移。
    1987年10月12日，茅老的夙愿终于实现了。中国共产党接纳了这位92岁高龄的新党员。
    主持入党仪式的中共中央统战部负责人，代表党组织对茅老入党表示热烈欢迎。他说，50年前，茅老主持建造了中华民族历史上第一座铁路大桥。30多年以来，他又以实际行动，为自己建造了一座由爱国主义者通向共产主义战士的大桥。
    茅老激动地说，加入中国共产党是我多年的愿望。这个愿望是我一生经验的总结。我要为党和人民的事业奋斗终生。
    奋斗，追求——这就是茅老一生的写照。正如他自己所说的：人生征途“崎岖多于平坦，忽深谷，忽洪涛，幸赖桥梁以渡。桥何名欤？曰：奋斗！”
    茅老虽然永远离开了我们，但他所建造的一座座大桥仍在，他那为党和人民的事业奋斗不息的精神永存。
