Tass News Agency, Moscow, November 14th.

The Soviet Union thwarted an attempt by criminals to take hostages and escape in the southern Ural region of Chelyabinsk on November 13th.

According to a report by Tass on November 14th, on the 13th, ten detainees in the Chelyabinsk detention center overpowered a guard, forcibly entered the visiting room, and took five women, a 12-year-old child, and a man hostage. The criminals demanded three assault rifles with ammunition, three handguns, and two cars, threatening to kill the hostages if their demands were not met.

The criminals were defiant and refused to negotiate. After attempts at persuasion failed, a special forces team was ordered to take action. They successfully rescued all the hostages, with two criminals injured in the process.

Crime in the Soviet Union has been on the rise in recent years. According to a statement by the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs on the 14th, there were approximately two million recorded criminal acts in the first ten months of this year, a 34.1% increase compared to the same period last year.

    苏联挫败一起匪徒扣留人质活动
    苏联南乌拉尔地区的车里雅宾斯克十三日挫败了一起匪徒扣留人质的企图潜逃的阴谋活动。
    据塔斯社十四日报道，十三日，车里雅宾斯克拘留所的十名收审人员抓住一名看守人员，强行进入探视间，扣留了在场的五名妇女、一名十二岁的儿童和一名男子作为人质。这帮匪徒声称，如果不给他们提供装有子弹的三支冲锋枪和三支手枪及两辆汽车，他们就要杀害人质。
    匪徒们气焰嚣张，拒绝谈判。经劝告无效后，有关部门组成的突击队奉命采取行动，从匪徒手中夺回人质。两名匪徒受伤，全部人质安全获释。
    苏联犯罪现象近年来有增无减，据苏联内务部十四日宣布，今年头十个月登记在案的犯罪行为约有二百万起，比去年同期增长百分之三十四点一。
