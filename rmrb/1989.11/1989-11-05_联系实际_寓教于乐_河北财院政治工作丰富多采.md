The Party Committee of Hebei University of Finance and Economics has paid great attention to studying the characteristics of young students. It has adopted rich and diverse forms to carry out ideological education among students, thereby enhancing the attractiveness and appeal of ideological and political work.

To change the weak and scattered situation of political work, over the past two years, the university Party Committee has selected a group of experienced and dedicated comrades to strengthen the Party branches and Party cells in various departments. At the same time, it has assigned capable and enthusiastic comrades to serve as full-time counselors, forming a strong political work team across the entire school.

Allowing students to receive education from the masses and to develop their skills through practice is an important aspect of the university's ideological and political work. During this summer vacation, the Party Committee organized students to conduct social investigations in urban and rural areas, combining centralized and decentralized approaches. Students from the Department of Commercial Economics went to the revolutionary base area of Quyang County, where they learned about the county's significant achievements over the past decade of reform, listened to the voices of the farmers, and received profound education, which also prompted them to reflect on themselves.

The university adapts to the characteristics of young students by integrating education with entertainment. Teachers teaching political and related professional courses carefully understand the students' doubts and social hot topics, and impart Marxist knowledge in a simple and accessible manner, propagating the Party's reform and opening-up policies and their achievements. The university also frequently holds various cultural and entertainment events, lectures, debates, academic seminars, and knowledge competitions, inviting scholars, experts, and model workers to give reports, so that students can receive ideological education in a subtle way.

In response to some students' lack of knowledge about the Party, the university established a student part-time party school, attracting student party members and active party applicants to participate in learning. The first session had 388 people enrolled. To meet the students' demands, several departments also set up branch schools. Through learning, students deepened their understanding of the Party. This year, among the graduating students, 113 wrote applications to join the Party, and 48 joined the Party. Many students strictly required themselves to meet the standards of a Communist Party member.

    联系实际　寓教于乐
    河北财院政治工作丰富多采
    本报石家庄电　记者陈国琦报道：河北财经学院党委十分注意研究青年学生的特点，采取丰富多采的形式对学生进行思想教育，从而增强了思想政治工作的吸引力和感召力。
    为改变政治工作软弱涣散状况，近两年来院党委挑选了一批有经验、热爱党务工作的同志，充实各系党总支和党支部，同时抽调有能力、工作热情的同志担任专职辅导员，全校形成了一支强有力的政工队伍。
    让学生到群众中接受教育，在实践中增长才干，是这个学院思想政治工作的重要环节。今年暑假期间，院党委采取集中和分散相结合的形式，组织学生深入城镇、农村，进行社会调查。商业经济系学生到革命老区曲阳县，了解了这个县十年改革的巨大成就，听取农民的呼声，受到了深刻的教育，也促使了他们自我反思。
    这个学院适应青年学生特点，寓教育于娱乐之中。教师上政治课及有关专业课，都细致地了解学生的疑点及社会上的热点，深入浅出地灌输马克思主义知识，宣传党的改革开放政策及其成就。学院还经常举办各种文娱会、讲演会、答辩会、学术研讨会和知识竞赛，请学者、专家及英模来校作报告，使学生在潜移默化中受到思想教育。
    针对有些学生缺乏党的知识，财经学院成立了学生业余党校，吸收学生党员和要求入党的积极分子参加学习，第一期就有388人报名。为满足学生们的要求，还在几个系设立了分校。通过学习使学生加深了对党的认识。今年应届毕业生中，有113人写了入党申请书，48人入了党。不少学生以共产党员的标准严格要求自己。
