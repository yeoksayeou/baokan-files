Premier Li Peng said tonight in Islamabad that the warm welcome and hospitality extended to him and his delegation by the Pakistani government and people have left a deep impression on him. He said his first visit to Pakistan has been a complete success.

Li Peng made the remarks at a dinner hosted by Pakistan's Minister without Portfolio Nusrat Bhutto in honor of him and his wife, Zhu Lin.

Nusrat Bhutto is the mother of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

Nusrat Bhutto said at the dinner that the close ties between Pakistan and China can be traced back to the mid-1960s. In the long river of history, 20 or 30 years may not seem significant, but for the development of the exemplary friendship between Pakistan and China, these 20 or 30 years have been crucial.

She spoke of her late husband, former Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and China's senior leaders, including Zhou Enlai, and their contributions to Pak-China friendship. She said Pakistan will never forget China's support in its struggle to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Nusrat Bhutto said Li Peng's visit has made a very valuable contribution to Pak-China friendship.

She said the decisions made by the leaders of the two countries in the past two or three days will yield fruitful results. Just as the friendship tree planted by Premier Zhou Enlai 25 years ago has grown lush, the friendship tree planted by Premier Li Peng today at Shakarparian Park will also flourish.

In his speech, Li Peng praised the friendship between Pakistan and China, nurtured by the senior leaders of the two countries. He also specially mentioned the important contributions made by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Premier Zhou Enlai to Pak-China friendship during their lifetimes.

Li Peng said Premier Zhou Enlai had always attached great importance to Pak-China friendship and had visited Pakistan many times. The friendship tree he planted has now grown very tall.

He said Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has carried on her father's legacy and continued to work for the development of friendly cooperative relations between Pakistan and China, and he expressed his delight and appreciation for this.

The speeches by Nusrat Bhutto and Li Peng were met with warm applause.

Pakistan's Foreign Minister Yaqub Khan and other high-ranking Pakistani officials attended the dinner.

China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin, and Vice Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army He Qizong were also invited to the dinner.

This afternoon, Li Peng and his wife Zhu Lin toured the city of Rawalpindi.

    努·布托宴请李鹏总理
    新华社伊斯兰堡11月16日电　（记者陈家保）李鹏总理今天晚上在此间说，巴基斯坦政府和人民对他和他的随行人员的热烈欢迎和款待，给他留下了深刻的印象。他对巴基斯坦的首次访问取得了圆满成功。
    李鹏是在巴高级不管部长努斯拉特·布托夫人为他和他的夫人朱琳举行的晚宴上发表上述讲话的。
    努·布托是贝·布托总理的母亲。
    努·布托在宴会上说，巴中的密切关系可以追溯到60年代中期。在历史的长河中，二三十年本无足轻重，然而对于堪称楷模的巴中友谊关系的发展来说，这二三十年却是关键的岁月。
    她谈到了她的丈夫、已故的巴前总理阿里·布托先生和中国老一辈领导人周恩来对巴中友谊的贡献。她说，巴基斯坦不会忘记，在捍卫国家主权和领土完整的斗争中中国给予巴基斯坦的支持。
    努·布托说，李鹏总理的这次访问为中巴友谊作出了十分宝贵的贡献。
    她说，中巴两国领导人在这两三天所作出的决定，将会产生丰硕的成果。就像25年前周恩来总理所种的友谊树一样，李鹏总理今天在夏克帕里扬山顶公园所种的友谊之树，也必将开花结果。
    李鹏在致词中赞扬由中巴两国老一辈领导人培育起来的中巴友谊。他也特别提到阿里·布托先生和周恩来总理生前对中巴友谊的重要贡献。
    李鹏说，周恩来总理生前特别重视中巴友谊，曾多次访巴。他当年种下的友谊树，如今已经长得十分茂盛。
    他说，贝·布托总理继承父亲的遗志，继续为发展中巴友好合作关系作出努力，他对此表示高兴和赞赏。
    努·布托和李鹏的讲话博得了热烈的掌声。
    巴基斯坦外交部长雅各布·汗和巴基斯坦其他高级官员出席了宴会。
    中国外长钱其琛、对外经贸部长郑拓彬和中国人民解放军副总参谋长何其宗也应邀出席了宴会。
