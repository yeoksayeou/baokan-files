More than a thousand medical and nursing workers gathered in Beijing today to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Nursing Association. Deng Yingchao, as the honorary president of the association, sent a congratulatory letter expressing greetings and respect to all nursing workers across the country.

Founded in 1909, the Chinese Nursing Association was originally named the Chinese Nurses Association and is a scholarly and mass organization for nurses in China. The association officially joined the International Council of Nurses in 1922, becoming the 11th member country. Wang Xiuying, the first recipient of the Florence Nightingale Medal in China and honorary president of the Chinese Nursing Association, said in her introduction of the association that by 1988, there were 127 branches and local branches nationwide. Among the more than 800,000 nurses in the country, 78,000 are members of the Chinese Nursing Association.

In her congratulatory letter, Deng Yingchao said that nursing work is a glorious and noble cause, an indispensable and important part of the entire medical field. She hoped that the Chinese Nursing Association would actively cultivate nursing talents, continuously improve nursing quality, and make due contributions to the health of 1.1 billion people in the country and to the Four Modernizations.

Minister of Health Chen Minzhang, in his speech, called on all levels of health administrative departments to attach importance to and strengthen the leadership of nursing work, and actively support nursing work.

Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Zhao Puxi attended the commemorative meeting today.
