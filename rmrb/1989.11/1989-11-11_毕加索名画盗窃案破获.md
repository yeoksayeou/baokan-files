The Picasso masterpiece theft case that shocked France over the weekend was solved on November 9. The mastermind behind the theft was revealed to be the security guard of Picasso's granddaughter, Marina.

After several days of investigation, the police focused their suspicions on the security guard of the owner's residence. The guard had turned off the alarm system and locked up five dogs before going into the city. The security guard eventually confessed that, with the help of another off-duty guard, he had calmly moved the artworks out the previous night and then reported the theft the next day.

In the afternoon of November 9, the police discovered the stolen seven Picasso oil paintings and more than ten other works by artists such as Matisse in the home of an art restorer in Toulon. These artworks are valued at over a billion francs.

    上周末轰动法国的毕加索名画盗窃案九日已破获，主谋竟是毕加索孙女玛丽娜家中的警卫。
    警方经过几天调查，疑点集中到主人家中的警卫身上，他进城为何要关闭警报系统，并把五条狗也关起来。警卫最后供认他在另一名休班警卫的帮助下，前一天晚上“从容”地把艺术品转移出去，然后第二天再报警。
    九日下午警方在土伦一个艺术品修复者的家中发现了被盗的七幅毕加索油画以及马蒂斯等名作家作品共十余件，这些艺术品价值上亿法郎。（本报专电）
