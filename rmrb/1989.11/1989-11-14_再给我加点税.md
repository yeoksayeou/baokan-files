On August 21 of this year, Chen Chunxiang, an individual cake maker from Xiaotanshi Village in Fei County, Shandong Province, brought 2,000 yuan to the Tanshi Tax Bureau and said to the tax officials, "The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming soon, and cake making is in its peak season. My business has also expanded. Please add some more tax for me." This was his fifth time since 1982, when he started making cakes, to voluntarily go to the tax bureau to request an increase in his tax payments. Some people said he was crazy. He, however, paid no attention and continued to increase his tax payments by tens of times.

Chen Chunxiang is 53 years old, with a dark red face and a sturdy build, a typical Shandong man. Chen Chunxiang helped his father with business when he was young and learned the skill of making pastries. However, due to the past collective production system, individual economy was seen as a capitalist tail and cut off, making Chen Chunxiang, despite his good skills, rely on return-sale grain to get by year after year. With the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy, Chen Chunxiang saw the hope of getting rich. In 1982, with the introduction of the village, he borrowed 400 yuan from the credit union to start making cakes, earning over 1,000 yuan that year. Because he conducted his business with integrity, his business gradually expanded, and by this year, his monthly sales had reached about 4,000 yuan. His income also increased year by year, and his life improved significantly.

The Party's policy of enriching the people made him prosperous, and he never forgot the country. In 1982, the tax authorities set his monthly tax at 5 yuan. In 1983, after his business expanded, he voluntarily went to the tax bureau to request an increase in his tax payments. After investigation and verification, the tax bureau increased his monthly tax to 20 yuan according to the tax law. Since then, as his production scale expanded, he voluntarily went to the tax bureau three more times to request an increase in his tax payments, raising his monthly fixed tax from 20 yuan to 106 yuan. Since August this year, Chen Chunxiang has voluntarily paid taxes amounting to 2,917 yuan and once again requested an increase in his tax burden. In the past two years, he has also subscribed to the "China Taxation" magazine and studied tax regulations carefully. When some individual households in the village were not enthusiastic about paying taxes, he would voluntarily talk to them and help with their ideological work. For this, he has been continuously evaluated by the tax authorities as a "model taxpayer."

    “再给我加点税”
    商庆顿
    今年8月21日，山东省费县小探沂村个体糕点加工户陈春祥，带着2000元钱来到探沂税务所，对税务所的同志说：“仲秋节快到了，糕点加工进入旺季，我的买卖也扩大了，请税务所再给我加点税。”这是他自1982年加工糕点以来，第五次主动到税务所要求增加税款。有人说他发傻。他却不在意，一直把自己交的税金增加了几十倍。
    陈春祥今年53岁，黑红脸膛，身材魁梧，是条标准的山东汉子。陈春祥小时候帮助父亲做买卖，学到了加工点心的技术。但由于过去搞集体化生产，个体经济被当作资本主义尾巴割掉了，使得陈春祥空有一手好技术，一家人年年靠吃返销粮过日子。随着开放搞活政策的实施，陈春祥看到了致富的希望。1982年经村里介绍，他到信用社贷款400元，搞起了糕点加工，一年收入了1000余元。由于他经营讲信誉，业务逐步扩大，到今年月营业额已达到4000元左右，收入也一年年增加，生活有了很大改善。
    党的富民政策使他发了家，他也始终没有忘记国家。1982年税务部门给他定月税5元。1983年业务扩大后，他便主动到税务所，要求增加税金。税务所经过调查核实，按税法规定给他增加到月税20元。在这之后，随着生产规模的扩大，他又先后三次及时主动地到税务所要求提高税金，使自己月定税由20元增加到106元，今年8月份以来，陈春祥又主动交税2917元，并再次要求提高税负。这两年，他还订阅了《中国税务》杂志，认真学习税收规定；村里有的个体户纳税不积极，他就主动找他们谈心，帮助做好思想工作。为此，他连年被税务部门评为“模范纳税户。”
