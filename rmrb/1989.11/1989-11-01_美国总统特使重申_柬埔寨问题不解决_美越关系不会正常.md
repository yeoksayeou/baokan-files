U.S. Presidential Envoy Reiterates:
Cambodia Issue Not Resolved, U.S.-Vietnam Relations Will Not Normalize

HANOI, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) — U.S. Presidential Envoy John Vessey today reiterated at a press conference in Hanoi that the United States will not normalize relations with Vietnam until the Cambodia issue is fully resolved.

Vessey's primary mission during this visit to Vietnam is to discuss with Vietnamese government officials the issue of U.S. personnel missing in action during the Vietnam War. He said that during his meeting with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, the issue of establishing a U.S. liaison office in Vietnam was not discussed. However, he believed that cooperation between the two sides to resolve some humanitarian issues would continue.

Nguyen Co Thach, who held the press conference with Vessey, said he had confirmed to Vessey that there are no more living U.S. missing in action personnel in Vietnam. However, a joint statement issued by both sides said that both sides agreed to improve and expand the cooperative process in areas such as conducting further investigations to obtain more accurate information about the fate of these Americans.

    美国总统特使重申
    柬埔寨问题不解决  美越关系不会正常
    新华社河内10月30日电  美国总统特使约翰·维西今天在此间举行的记者招待会上重申，在柬埔寨问题得到全面解决之前，美国不同越南实现关系正常化。
    维西此次越南之行的主要任务是同越南政府官员谈美国在越南战争中失踪人员问题。他说，他同越南外长阮基石的会谈中未讨论美国在越南设立办事处问题，但他认为双方合作来解决一些人道主义问题还将继续。
    与维西一同举行记者招待会的阮基石说，他已向维西证实越南再无活着的美国失踪人员。但双方发表的一项联合声明说，双方同意在诸如进一步进行调查以获得这些美国人命运的确切情况等方面，改进和扩大合作进程。
