Palestinian Ambassador to China Issues Statement: Palestinian People Will Not Abandon Struggle for Liberation of Their Homeland

	New China News Agency Beijing, November 15 - Palestinian Ambassador to China Youssef Rajoub said today that the Palestinian people have not wavered and will not abandon their struggle to liberate their homeland, Palestine.

	To celebrate the first anniversary of the establishment of the State of Palestine and the 25th anniversary of the Palestinian revolution, Ambassador Youssef Rajoub issued a statement today. In the statement, he said that so far, more than 100 countries around the world have recognized the State of Palestine.

	Ambassador Youssef said, "The State of Palestine loves peace and adheres to the principle of peaceful coexistence. Together with all countries and peoples of the world, we strive to achieve lasting peace based on justice and respect for rights." He said, "Our people fully understand that the struggle for independence and the construction of the nation is not easy. We have been fighting for more than 70 years. We have never expected to win overnight."

	Ambassador Youssef said, "We are determined to achieve a just peace in the Middle East. We have taken some bold and proactive peace actions, including advocating for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East, hosted by the United Nations, with the participation of its Security Council permanent members and all parties to the Middle East conflict, including the Palestinian people's sole legitimate representative, the Palestine Liberation Organization."

	He pointed out that the Middle East international conference should be held on the basis of UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, to seek a just solution to the Middle East problem and its core, the Palestinian problem, to achieve the freedom and independence of the Palestinian people. In the struggle of the Palestinian people to defend their legitimate national and political rights, the most important thing is their right to self-determination.

    巴勒斯坦国驻华大使发表声明
    巴人民不放弃解放国土斗争
    新华社北京11月15日电　巴勒斯坦国驻华大使尤素夫·拉吉布今天在这里说，巴勒斯坦人民没有动摇，也不会放弃为解放自己的国土巴勒斯坦国所进行的斗争。
    为庆祝巴勒斯坦国成立1周年和巴勒斯坦革命25周年，尤素夫·拉吉布大使今天在这里发表了一项声明。他在声明中说，迄今为止，世界已有100多个国家承认了巴勒斯坦国。
    尤素夫大使说，巴勒斯坦国酷爱和平，奉行和平共处的原则，同世界上所有国家和人民一道，为争取建立在正义和尊重权利基础上的永久和平而努力奋斗。他说，“我国人民充分认识到，争取独立和建设国家的斗争不是轻而易举的。我们已经斗争了70多年。我们从未期望能在一夜之间赢得胜利。”
    尤素夫大使说，“我们决心实现中东地区的公正和平。我们采取了一些果敢的主动的和平行动，包括争取通过召开由联合国主持的、由其安理会常任理事国和中东地区冲突各方包括巴勒斯坦人民唯一合法代表巴勒斯坦解放组织参加的中东问题国际会议。”
    他指出，中东国际会议应在联合国安理会242号和338号决议的基础上召开，以求中东问题及其核心的巴勒斯坦问题得到公正解决，以实现巴勒斯坦人民的自由和独立的目标。在巴勒斯坦人民维护他们合法的民族和政治权利斗争中，最重要的是他们的民族自决权。
