The melodious tune,
“Brulrufan's grapes are ripe,
The girl's heart is intoxicated…”
This enchanting melody resonates through the lush, dense forests, glides over the verdant grape trellises, and brings us to the beautiful and diverse Xinjiang Brulrufan Grape Valley.

From Brulrufan County, traveling north for about seven or eight kilometers, you will arrive at the famous Grape Valley. As soon as we reached Brulrufan County, we saw that the sidewalks on both sides of the road were made of intertwined grape vines, forming a “green corridor.” We also saw grapes displayed on stalls, in small carts, in baskets, and in the hands of people, giving us a sense of entering the “Kingdom of Grapes.” Little did we know that as the car wound its way north, the rich atmosphere of the “Kingdom of Grapes” became even more overwhelming. As the car entered the Grape Valley, we saw the winding, curving roads on both sides lined with lush, verdant grape fields stretching for miles. The grape orchards, grape trellises, and grape clusters were everywhere, dense and numerous, making it hard to take in everything at once. The newly built countless yellow-brown shade houses, dotted in the vast grape fields, were particularly beautiful. These are structures designed to shade from the sun, with walls that are perforated for ventilation, and a honeycomb-like flat roof. They are specifically used for drying grapes. As we stopped the car and strolled through the village, we discovered that almost every household had a grape orchard, and every family had a grape trellis. When guests arrived, they would set up a few stools under the grape trellis to welcome them. It was mid-autumn, the season when grapes ripen, and everywhere was laden with fruit. Looking up at the lush grape trellises, we saw clusters of grapes in various colors—yellow-green, purple-red, light red, and emerald green—and in various shapes—round, heart-shaped, and horse-teat-shaped. The fragrance wafted through the air, refreshing the mind, and making one feel intoxicated!

The beautiful scenery and tempting grapes of the Grape Valley make it a famous tourist destination in Xinjiang. In recent years, the Grape Valley has built a charming “Reception Center,” which welcomes guests from all directions in its unique way. The “Reception Center” is constructed with grape trellises forming a courtyard, with grape vines intertwining and winding paths leading to secluded spots. Under the low grape trellises, water flows gently, and songs echo softly. Clusters of grapes are within reach. As long as you pay one yuan and fifty jiao, you can pick and enjoy them to your heart's content. The seedless white grapes produced here are pale yellow with a hint of dawn white, like pearls or crystals. The clusters are large, the grapes are small and round, and they are sweet but not cloying, fresh and fragrant, pure and seedless, earning them the title of the “King of Grapes.” Especially in this picturesque homeland of grapes, picking them fresh and tasting them with dew, there is an endless aftertaste.

The Grape Valley is home to over six thousand people from the Uyghur, Hui, and Han ethnic groups, who mainly cultivate grapes. They have lived harmoniously for generations, supporting and helping each other, forming a close-knit family. Together, they have created over a hundred varieties of grapes, including seedless white, jade green, red agate, pearl white, and black jade, like the fruits of the flower of ethnic unity. The grapes and dried grapes they produce account for about one-fifth of the annual output of the Brulrufan Basin, making it the main commercial grape-producing area, with products sold throughout the country and around the world.

The Grape Valley is like a bright pearl hanging on the edge of the motherland.

　　醉人的葡萄沟
　　李秀昌
      “吐鲁番的葡萄熟了，
      姑娘的心儿醉了……”
    这婉啭的流韵，颤出葱笼茂密的树林，滑过苍翠的葡萄架，把我们带到了美丽多姿的新疆吐鲁番的葡萄沟。
    从吐鲁番县城向北行走七八公里，便是闻名遐迩的葡萄沟。我们刚到吐鲁番县城，看到马路两旁的人行道，竟是葡萄枝叶交织而成的“绿色长廊”，又看到摊点上摆的，小车上摊的，筐篮里挑的，人们手里提的，都是晶莹圆润的葡萄，就有进入“葡萄王国”之感。哪知随着车子逶迤北进，“葡萄王国”的浓郁气氛，更加夺路而来。车子进入葡萄沟，只见蜿蜒曲折的公路两旁，架绿铺翠的葡萄田一泻数里，葡萄园、葡萄架、葡萄串，一丛丛，一片片，密密麻麻，使人目不暇接。新建的无数土黄色的荫房，点缀在一望无垠的葡萄园中，十分美丽。这是一种上遮太阳，四壁镂空利于通风、孔如蜂窝似的平顶土坯建筑。它是专门用来晾制葡萄干的。我们车停漫步村间，发现这里几乎家家都有葡萄园，户户有葡萄架。客人来了，就在葡萄架下摆几张凳子接待。时值仲秋，正是葡萄成熟的季节，到处硕果累累。抬头看着枝叶繁茂的葡萄架上，挂满了黄绿、紫红、微红、碧绿各色，圆形、鸡心形、马奶形等各种大、小葡萄串，香味随风四溢，沁人心脾，使人心醉！
    葡萄沟秀丽的风光和诱人流涎咽唾的葡萄，使这里成为新疆著名的游览地。近年来葡萄沟新建了玲珑别致的“接待站”，以它特有的方式招待着四方来客。“接待站”用葡萄架搭成庭院，院内葡萄藤蔓交织，曲径通幽。低低的葡萄架下，流水潺潺，歌声悠扬，一串串葡萄举手可得。只要你交上一元五角钱，就可随意采摘，尽情品尝。这里盛产的无核白葡萄，淡黄中透着曙白，如珍珠，似水晶，穗大粒小，圆润媚人。吃起来甜而不腻，清香鲜美，纯净无渣，被誉为葡萄之冠。特别是在这风景如画的葡萄的故乡，随意摘来，含露品尝，更有无穷的回味。
    葡萄沟居住着维吾尔、回、汉三个民族共六千多人，主要种植葡萄。他们世代和睦相处，互相支持，互相帮助，组成了一个亲密无间的大家庭。他们共同创造的无核白、翡翠绿、红玛瑙、珍珠白、黛玉黑以及琐琐葡萄等一百多个品种，像是民族团结之花结出的一串串硕果。他们生产的葡萄及葡萄干，约占吐鲁番盆地年产量的五分之一，是商品葡萄的主要产区，产品远销全国和世界各地。
    葡萄沟，仿佛是挂在祖国边陲的一颗明珠。
