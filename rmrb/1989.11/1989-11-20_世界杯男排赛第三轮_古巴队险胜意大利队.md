The third round of the sixth World Cup men's volleyball tournament has begun, and the competition for the championship is becoming clearer. Today's results of the four matches are as follows: Cuba defeated Italy 3-2, the United States defeated South Korea 3-1, the Soviet Union defeated Cameroon 3-0, and Japan defeated Brazil 3-1.

Because Cuba defeated the United States and Italy defeated the Soviet Union yesterday, today's match between Cuba and Italy became crucial for predicting the outcome of this tournament. The outstanding jumping ability of the Cuban players compensated for their slightly lower average height compared to their opponents. The first two sets ended with both teams winning one set each, 15-13. In the third and fourth sets, both teams won with a significant point difference. In the fifth set, Cuba led 7-5, but Italy took the lead with 11-9. After a 13-13 tie, Cuba scored a point with a block, and Italy's attack went out of bounds, giving Cuba the victory. The total score of the five sets was only one point higher for Cuba. Whether the Cuban men's and women's teams can both win the championship has become a topic of discussion. The fourth round against the Soviet Union will be the final obstacle for Cuba to win the championship.

    世界杯男排赛第三轮
    古巴队险胜意大利队
    本报东京十一月十九日电　记者于青报道：第六届世界杯男排赛进入第三轮，杯落谁手的形势渐趋明朗。今天四场比赛的结果是，古巴队三比二胜意大利队，美国队三比一胜南朝鲜队，苏联队三比零胜喀麦隆队，日本队三比一胜巴西队。
    因为昨天古巴队战胜美国队，意大利队战胜苏联队，今天古巴队和意大利队的比赛，成为人们窥测本届比赛大势的关键。古巴队员出色的弹跳力，弥补了平均身高略低于对手的不足。前两局双方各以十五比十三取胜一局，第三、四局又各以悬殊比分轻取对方。第五局古巴队先以七比五领先，意大利队反以十一比九超出。十三平后，古巴队拦网得一分，对方扣球出界又送一分，最终取胜。五局总分之和，古巴队仅多一分。古巴男女队能否双双夺冠，成为人们议论的话题。第四轮对苏联队，将是古巴队夺冠的最后障碍。
