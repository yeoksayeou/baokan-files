A new type of "technological alliance" has taken shape in the adjacent cities of Jianyang, Lishui, Shangrao, Hangzhou, Jinhua, Quzhou, Yingtan, Jingdezhen, and Huangshan in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces, and is becoming a hotspot for economic cooperation in this region.

Over the past four years, these nine cities have engaged in horizontal economic cooperation, discussing and implementing nearly a thousand joint projects. They have pooled funds totaling over 5 billion yuan and exchanged goods worth over 600 million yuan, significantly promoting the complementary advantages and common prosperity of this region.

As the rectification and regulation efforts deepen, the leaders of these nine cities have realized that the old economic structure no longer suits the development of the regional economy. They believe that only through scientific and technological cooperation and expanding internal production can a new regional economic advantage be formed. Thus, scientific and technological cooperation among the nine cities has ignited like a spark. Statistics show that in just one year, the nine cities discussed and implemented 79 scientific and technological cooperation projects, introduced and exported 320 technical personnel, and equipped over 400 enterprises with new technological capabilities. Among these, seven cities saw a new increase in production value of nearly 70 million yuan and tax revenue of over 12 million yuan. Recently, 600 people, including managers and directors from 378 scientific research institutions and some enterprises in the nine cities, gathered in Huangshan City to discuss further strengthening scientific and technological cooperation. They reached an agreement to establish an "outward-looking regional technological market," form a "technological alliance," and develop a "technologically leading" economy.

　　闽浙赣皖九地市结成科技联合体
　　四年来已实施近千个联合项目
    据新华社黄山11月20日电　（记者纪成助）在我国闽浙赣皖毗邻的建阳、丽水、上饶、杭州、金华、衢州、鹰潭、景德镇、黄山九个地市，一种新型的“科技联合体”已初步形成，并正成为这一区域经济联合的热点。
    闽浙赣皖毗邻九地市开展横向经济联合4年来，已洽谈并实施联合项目近千个，融通资金50多亿元，协作物资总额6亿多元，有力地促进了这一区域的优势互补和共同繁荣。
    随着整顿治理的不断深化，九地市领导深感旧经济格局已不适应区域经济的发展，只有通过科学、技术的协作，扩大内涵再生产，才能组成新的区域经济优势。于是，九地市的科技协作如“星星之火”般点燃起来。据统计，仅去年一年，九地市洽谈并实施科技协作项目就有79个，引进、输出技术人才320人次，有400多家企业重新得到“科技武装”，其中有7个地市新增产值近7000万元，利税1200多万元。最近，九地市378家科研单位和部分企业的厂长、经理等600余人又云集黄山市，就进一步加强科技协作问题进行了深入研讨，并达成了建立“外向型区域科技市场”，结成“科技联合体”，发展“科技先导型”经济的协议。
