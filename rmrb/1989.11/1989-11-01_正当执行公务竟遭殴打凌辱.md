After the cleanup and rectification of the company began, the supply and marketing company of Yudong Steel Mill in Yongcheng County, Henan Province, neither sent representatives to attend relevant meetings nor submitted self-inspection reports. The office of the county's cleanup and rectification leading group sent people to find the company's responsible person, Dong Xianping, multiple times, but were unable to meet her.

In April, the cleanup and rectification of companies in Yongcheng County entered the acceptance stage. At 3:10 PM on April 3, Xia Dengke, the head of the enterprise division of the county's Industrial and Commercial Bureau and the responsible person of the office of the cleanup and rectification leading group, along with Nie Xuguang and Chen Tiliang, went to Dong Xianping's home. They had just asked one question when four or five young people interrupted. Xia Dengke asked these young people not to interrupt. Unexpectedly, the young people immediately started beating Xia Dengke with fists and feet. Dong Xianping's husband, Yin Zilin, picked up a plate and smashed it on Xia's head. During this time, Nie Xuguang and Chen Tiliang were pushed to the side and not allowed to move.

After the incident, the county's Party committee and government promptly convened a meeting with relevant departments to discuss the matter. The public security department took active measures and handled these lawbreakers who disrupted the cleanup and rectification of companies in accordance with the law.

    正当执行公务竟遭殴打凌辱
    在清理整顿公司开始后，我省永城县豫东钢厂供销公司既不派人参加有关会议，也不报自查表。县清理整顿领导组办公室多次派人去找公司负责人董先苹，都未能面见。
    4月，永城县清理整顿公司工作进入验收阶段。4月3日下午3点10分，县工商局企业股长、清理整顿公司领导组办公室负责人夏登科和聂旭光、陈体亮3人来到董先苹家，刚问了一个问题，随即进来四五个青年人打岔，夏登科请这几个青年人不要插话。没想到，几个青年便对夏一阵拳打脚踢，董先苹的丈夫尹子林拿起一个盘子砸夏的头。这期间，聂旭光、陈体亮2人被他们推到了旁边不准动。
    案件发生后，县委、县政府及时召开有关部门会议研究。公安部门积极行动，依法查处这些破坏清理整顿公司的不法之徒。
