On a clear, slightly cool autumn night in Beijing in 1989, three hundred or so people gathered in a "spherical" circular space, watching a group of People's Liberation Army Air Force soldiers who had walked out from the depths of history.

This was in the rehearsal hall of the Air Force Drama Troupe, known as the "black box," which had been renovated. The Air Force Drama Troupe was performing the non-sequential play *Far Clouds, Near Clouds* (scripted by Han Jingting, directed by Liao Xianghong, designed by Xu Xiang). The performance area and the audience seats were overlapping, and within this shared space of the audience and performers, any point could become the performance area. The audience's viewing distance was far, medium, and near, and the viewing angle could rotate 360 degrees, allowing for a close-up view of the performers' facial expressions and subtle emotions, as well as a distant view of the orderly and majestic formation of the soldiers. One could open all the senses to receive the artistic information transmitted by the "omnidirectional" performance, or focus on a specific part of the scene to savor the "close-up." Undoubtedly, the "open space concept" of this play brought great freedom to the audience's appreciation. This is the first play in the military theater that I have seen that truly embodies the concept of "small theater drama" in terms of space design and directing techniques.

However, do not assume that *Far Clouds, Near Clouds* attracts people only with its novel performance style and unique space design. No, what truly moves the audience is the soul-stirring military spirit conveyed in the performance, the bold and unrestrained emotions that permeate the space!

Far clouds drift away, near clouds roll in. When Han Jingting conceived the play, he drew an analogy, linking the endless white clouds with the pure souls of the generations of air force soldiers of the People's Republic of China, using one to symbolize the other. Through the lives of three generations of a military family and the male and female pilots related to these three generations, he shows how the People's Air Force of New China has changed from one generation to the next, while a great spirit of self-sacrifice is passed down from generation to generation, unbroken. That is: to maintain the dignity of the crystal-clear blue sky of the motherland, even sacrificing a colorful life is worth it.

To convey this meaning, the author structured a story spanning thirty-six years, constantly guiding the audience to change their perspective in the overlapping and reversing of history and reality, to feel the noble sentiments of the air force soldiers from their choices of life and death, conflicts of reason and emotion, concepts of honor and disgrace, and even family conflicts. They show their courage to sacrifice, their heroic spirit from generation to generation. The play tightly grasps this core, setting events around people, and focuses on portraying the souls of three generations of air force soldiers as beautiful as a painting. Thus, the hidden restraint of the longing for love that maintains the rhythm of the camp's "straight lines and squares," the erosion of the beautiful youth of the 1960s and 1970s, the mixed and confusing social prejudices and petty-mindedness that test the soldiers' beliefs, all become the atmosphere that highlights the existence of the strong personality of soldiers like Ye Jie, Ye Hui, Chen Rongrong, Lu Yun, and Ye Xiaofeng. On the contrary, they complement each other, enhancing each other's strengths. Therefore, when the first-generation female pilot Ye Hui and the instructor Xiao Mu fall in love but can only part with a sigh, you will feel sorry for them, but at the same time, you will appreciate the rarity of their spirit of burying personal disappointments deep in their hearts and devoting themselves wholeheartedly to the cause of aviation defense. When you feel pain for this group of "talents made of gold" who were once wasted in the "May Seventh Cadres School," you will feel even more the burning heat of their patriotic feelings, restless because they have no way to serve their country. When you feel worried about the blind and noisy social psychology, you will also feel joy because the light of ideals still shines on these male and female soldiers who are like statues.

Oh, a song of the military spirit, with historical and realistic reflections.

    魂系蓝天  代代雄风
    ——话剧《远的云、近的云》观后
    吴戈
    北京。一九八九年仲秋一个清朗微凉的夜晚，一个“球体内”式的圆形空间里聚集着三百来人，注视着一群从历史帷幕深处走过来的中华人民共和国空军指战员。
    这是在空政话剧团被改造过的排练厅——“黑匣子”里，空政话剧团正上演无场次话剧《远的云、近的云》（韩静霆编剧、廖向红导演、徐翔设计）。表演区与观众席是重叠的，在这观众与演员共同据有的空间内，任何一点都能成为表演区；而观众的视距远、中、近皆备，视角可旋转三百六十度，既可细看演员眉宇眼波里的笑纹怒意，亦可远观军人方阵的整齐雄壮；既可张开全身感觉器官接收“全方位”表演传达出的艺术信息，也可以专注于场面局部，品味“特写”。无疑，这出戏“空间观念”的开放，带来了观众欣赏心理的极大自由，这是迄今为止我所看过的部队戏中，真正在空间设计、导演手法上体现出明确的“小剧场戏剧”意识的第一部。
    但是，切莫以为《远的云、近的云》仅仅以新颖的演出形式、独特的空间设计吸引人，不，更深深打动观众的，是那表演中传递的荡气回肠的军魂精神，是那空间弥漫翻滚着的豪放情致！
    远的云，近的云。远的云悠悠而去，近的云滚滚而来。韩静霆创作构思时，立意取譬，将飘不尽的白云与中华人民共和国一代代蓝天卫士生生不息的纯洁灵魂联系起来，相互为喻，以一个空军世家三代人及与这三代人相关的男女飞行员的生活为视点，展示新中国人民空军代代更迭交替，而一种伟大的奉献精神却世世相传、延绵不绝，那就是：为了维护祖国晶洁湛蓝的天宇的尊严，哪怕牺牲七彩的人生也在所不惜。
    为了传达这一意蕴，作者结构了一个跨度三十六年的故事，在历史与现实的重叠倒错中不断引导观众改变观察角度，从军人的生死选择、情理冲突、荣辱观念甚至家庭矛盾中去感受一代代空军魂系蓝天、一心报国、九死未悔的崇高情怀，去展示他们勇于牺牲、代代雄风的人格力量。戏剧紧紧抓住这一核心，因人设事，着力刻画了三代空军战士美如画卷的灵魂。于是，那使得军营“直线加方块”的韵律保持壮美的儿女情长的隐忍克制，六七十年代颠来倒去的岁月对人的美好青春的消磨、驳杂迷离的社会偏见和庸人气息对军人信念的考验，都统统化为了烘托叶戟、叶蕙、陈戎戎、陆芸、叶小枫们强大的军人人格力量存在的氛围，相反相成，相得益彰。因而，当第一代女飞行员叶蕙与教官肖木相爱却又不能不止于怅望送别时，你会为他们扼腕可惜，同时感到他们将个人失意深藏心底而全心身投入航空国防事业的精神难能可贵；当你为这一群“用金子堆起来的特殊人才”曾在“五·七”干校蹉跎而痛心时，更感到他们因报国无门而躁动不安的赤子情怀的炽热如火；当世俗偏见、投机心态一片喧嚣，你为波动盲目的社会心理感到忧心如焚之时，你也会因在这些群英雕像般的男女军人身上，理想之光依然闪烁而感到欢欣。
    哦，一曲军魂的颂歌，带着历史、现实的沉思。
