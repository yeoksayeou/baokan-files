Our correspondent reports from Islamabad, November 15: This morning, Premier Li Peng and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto held their second round of talks at the new Presidential Palace in Islamabad. This round of talks, which lasted over two hours, was a continuation of the smaller-scale talks held between the two leaders the previous day.

The talks were conducted in a friendly and cordial atmosphere. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto once again extended a warm welcome to Premier Li Peng and his delegation. She stated that developing friendly relations with China is a cornerstone of Pakistan's foreign policy. Mutual trust between Pakistan and China is a source of strength for Pakistan in safeguarding its national sovereignty. The friendship between Pakistan and China has withstood the test of time, serving the interests of the peoples of both countries and contributing to the maintenance of peace in South Asia. Benazir Bhutto said that cooperation between Pakistan and China in various fields such as politics, economics, and trade has been successful, and their collaboration in international affairs has been effective. She also mentioned that the first round of talks between her and Premier Li Peng the previous day had been very fruitful.

During the talks, the Chinese side expressed satisfaction with the development of friendly cooperative relations between China and Pakistan and believed that there is still great potential for cooperation between the two countries in the future. China is willing to work with Pakistan to strengthen and consolidate this friendly cooperative relationship.

The two prime ministers also exchanged in-depth views on major international issues of mutual concern. Premier Li Peng introduced China's basic views on the world situation, expounded on China's independent and peaceful foreign policy, and briefed on the development of China's relations with some countries.

When discussing regional issues, Premier Li Peng stated that China will continue to develop friendly cooperative relations with all South Asian countries and hopes that the countries in South Asia will get along amicably on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and promote regional cooperation.

Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto introduced Pakistan's stance on some major international issues and the development of its foreign relations. When discussing the situation in Afghanistan, she said that Pakistan still pays close attention to this issue because the civil war in Afghanistan is still ongoing, and there are still 3 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan. She said that the Pakistani government is committed to a political solution to the Afghan problem and advocates for the establishment of a broad-based, united government that the Afghan people can accept.

Premier Li Peng introduced China's position on the Afghan issue. Li Peng said that China is concerned about the situation in Afghanistan and hopes that various political forces in Afghanistan can establish a broad-based united government through consultations, so that peace in Afghanistan can be restored as soon as possible and the 3 million Afghan refugees can return to their homes with dignity.

During the talks, both sides also briefed each other on the political and economic situations in their respective countries. Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin, and Pakistani Foreign Minister Jacob Khan, and Prime Minister's Advisor on Foreign Affairs and National Security Iqbal Akhund participated in the talks.
