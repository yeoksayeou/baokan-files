To address the current challenges of a sluggish market and tight funds, Fujian Province is implementing a series of effective measures to stabilize industrial production.

Fujian Province is focusing on expanding the market and increasing sales. Provincial and municipal governments have established leading groups for expanding industrial product sales. Leaders have visited factories and stores to conduct investigations and research, identifying the causes of product backlogs and adopting various forms of sales strategies. Industrial, commercial, and supply and marketing departments are organizing industrial products to go to the countryside and deliver goods to the doorstep. They are also promoting joint production and sales, reward-based sales, discounted sales, value-preserving sales, barter trade, and holding exhibitions and order meetings. At the same time, to address the concerns of sales and procurement personnel, the province has clarified policies to encourage expanded sales, continuing to implement performance-based rewards and bonuses tied to sales volume to motivate enterprises and sales personnel.

To facilitate fund circulation, the province has established a financial coordination leading group composed of financial and economic management departments. This group flexibly allocates loan quotas and funds to ensure that large and medium-sized enterprises have the necessary funds for stable production. It also supports production enterprises and material procurement and sales departments in rationally stockpiling scarce raw materials and auxiliary materials. Banks and planning, economic, and enterprise management departments are working closely together to determine reasonable inventory limits for each enterprise and set deadlines for reduction. Funds recovered from the disposal of excess and backlogged products by enterprises, if genuinely needed, are allowed to be retained for turnover.

Fujian Province has also established a comprehensive dispatch center for industrial production, involving the planning, economic, financial, energy, material, and transportation departments. This center, along with local governments and key enterprises, forms a dispatch network to timely grasp information, unify dispatch, balance surpluses and shortages, and ensure that key enterprises have the necessary materials, funds, energy, and transportation.

　　福建寻对策稳定工业
    本报福州11月24日电　记者张铭清报道：针对当前出现的市场疲软、资金紧缺等困难，福建省正采取一系列有力措施，千方百计稳定工业生产。
    福建省把开拓市场、扩大销售作为重点来抓。省地市成立扩大工业品销售领导小组，领导干部深入工厂、商店调查研究，分清各种产品积压情况，采取多种形式进行销售。工业、商业、供销部门组织工业品下乡、送货上门，开展联产联销、有奖销售、让利销售、保值销售、易货贸易，举办展销会、定货会等。同时，针对推销、采购人员思想顾虑，明确鼓励扩大销售的政策，继续执行推行商品实绩与奖励挂钩、按商品销售额提取奖金等方法，以调动企业和推销人员的积极性。
    为了搞好资金融通，省里成立了由金融和经济主管部门组成的金融协调领导小组，灵活调度贷款限额和资金，保证大中型企业稳定生产的资金需要，支持生产企业和物资购销部门合理储备紧缺的原辅材料。银行和计委、经委、企业主管部门密切配合，逐个企业核定合理的库存限额，确定压缩期限。企业处理超储、积压产品后回笼的资金，企业确实需要，允许留下周转。
    福建省还成立了由计委、经委、金融、能源、物资、交通等部门参加的工交生产总调度室，与各地市及重点企业组成调度网络，及时掌握信息，统一调度，调剂余缺，保证重点企业生产急需的物资、资金、能源、运输得以落实。
