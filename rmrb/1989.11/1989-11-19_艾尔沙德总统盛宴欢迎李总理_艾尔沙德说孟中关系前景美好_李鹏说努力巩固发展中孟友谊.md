Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, November 17th.

President Ershad of Bangladesh hosted a grand banquet at the presidential palace this evening to welcome Premier Li Peng of China, who arrived earlier in the afternoon for a formal friendly visit.

Tonight, the presidential palace and its gardens were adorned with colorful lights. The banquet hall featured the national flags of both countries. Candles were lit on the tables. During the banquet, the national orchestra of Bangladesh performed songs from both countries.

President Ershad spoke first at the banquet. He said, "Premier Li Peng's visit symbolizes the very close and brotherly relationship between the governments and peoples of China and Bangladesh. In pursuing our respective goals, Bangladesh highly values the friendship and bonds that unite the two countries."

Ershad stated that the future of China-Bangladesh relations is bright. In a short period, the two countries have established a solid foundation for cooperation, which is now expanding. The potential for bilateral cooperation is immense.

He emphasized that the fifth session of the joint economic committee of the two countries has just concluded in Beijing. Tomorrow, a long-term trade agreement and the 12th trade protocol will be signed. The upcoming signing of the visa exemption agreement will facilitate the exchange of officials between the two countries. All these measures reflect the desire of the peoples of both countries to establish closer ties.

He then cited examples such as the recent completion of the China-Bangladesh Friendship Bridge in Dhaka, the inauguration of the new building of the China-Bangladesh Friendship Primary School in Beijing, and cooperation in flood control to illustrate the development of the cooperative relationship between the two countries.

In discussing the international situation, he said that China and Bangladesh have similar views on the current world and are cooperating to achieve common goals.

He pointed out that with the easing of tensions between superpowers, tensions in other regions of the world have also eased. However, there are still some prominent trouble spots in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

He reiterated Bangladesh's principled stance on the issues of Namibia, Palestine, Afghanistan, and Cambodia. Regarding the Cambodian issue, he said that only a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian problem can ensure a just and lasting peace for Cambodia. To this end, all parties concerned in Cambodia must resume dialogue, and all foreign troops must withdraw from Cambodia under the supervision of the United Nations.

He said that the gap between rich and poor countries is widening and cannot be resolved in the near future. We will rely on future generations to continue the North-South dialogue to establish a just international economic order.

He praised the significant progress made by the Chinese people under the strong leadership of their leaders. He said, "The success of your policies is evident in the remarkable development of your country in recent years. Despite the pressures and challenges, you have maintained this development speed, which vividly demonstrates the foresight and inner strength of China's leadership and society."

Premier Li Peng first expressed his deep gratitude for the warm and enthusiastic welcome he received from the people of Dhaka today. He said, "This fully demonstrates the friendly feelings of the Bangladeshi people towards the Chinese people."

He said, "China and Bangladesh are very friendly neighbors, and there is a deep friendship between the peoples of the two countries. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1975, the relationship between the two countries has entered a new historical period. Over the past few decades, despite the changing international situation, the relationship between China and Bangladesh has continued to develop smoothly. The two countries not only cooperate effectively in the fields of economy, trade, science and technology, and culture, but also support and cooperate closely with each other in international affairs. Equality, mutual trust, sincerity, friendship, and mutual benefit have become the distinctive features of China-Bangladesh relations."

He said, "President Ershad is an old friend of the Chinese people, having visited China five times and made important contributions to promoting China-Bangladesh friendship. Recently, President Ershad's wife, Roshan Ershad, also visited China and attended the inauguration ceremony of the new building of the China-Bangladesh Friendship Primary School. Now, the China-Bangladesh Friendship Primary School and the China-Bangladesh Friendship Bridge have become symbols of China-Bangladesh friendship, adding a glorious page to the history of friendly relations between the two countries. China-Bangladesh friendship fully serves the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries and is also conducive to peace in Asia. Continuously consolidating and developing the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries is a consistent policy of the governments of the two countries."

Li Peng said that the important purpose of his visit is to make new efforts to consolidate and develop China-Bangladesh friendship. He expressed his belief that his visit would definitely be a complete success.

Li Peng said that under the leadership of President Ershad, Bangladesh is actively exploring a development path suitable to its national conditions, striving to maintain domestic unity and stability, develop its economy, and improve the living standards of its people. Especially in the fight against floods, the unyielding spirit and determination of the Bangladeshi people to overcome difficulties are admirable.

He said that Bangladesh pursues an independent and non-aligned foreign policy, adheres to principles, and advocates justice in international affairs, playing an active role and winning the praise of the international community.

In discussing the situation in South Asia, Li Peng said that all countries in South Asia are developing countries and belong to the Third World, facing the tasks of safeguarding national independence and sovereignty, developing national economies, and improving the living standards of their people. China hopes that South Asia will maintain stability and prosperity. China highly appreciates Bangladesh's unremitting efforts in promoting friendly relations among South Asian countries and promoting regional cooperation. China sincerely hopes that all countries in South Asia, regardless of size, will adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, coexist peacefully on this basis, respect each other, consult equally, and properly resolve existing problems and certain disputes between countries, rather than resorting to force.

He pointed out, "The current international situation is undergoing positive changes from tension to relaxation and from confrontation to dialogue. However, it should also be noted that factors endangering world peace still exist. Many regional hotspots have not been resolved, and we must not relax our vigilance. Moreover, there is still an irrational economic order in the world. The rich countries are getting richer, and the poor countries are getting poorer. Many developing countries still have to make unremitting efforts to maintain the minimum living standards of their people."

He said, "China will continue to adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy and is willing to work with Bangladesh and all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world to maintain and promote world peace and development, and to contribute to the establishment of a new international political and economic order based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."

The speeches of Li Peng and Ershad received enthusiastic applause from the audience.

Before the banquet, Li Peng had a courtesy call with Ershad.

Bangladesh's Vice President Muhammad Uddin Ahmed, Speaker of the Parliament Shahabuddin Ahmed, and Prime Minister Kazi Zafar Ahmed attended the banquet.

Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin, and Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army He Qizong were also invited to the banquet.

Before the banquet ended, Bangladeshi artists performed wonderful national songs and dances for the Chinese guests.

    艾尔沙德总统盛宴欢迎李总理
    艾尔沙德说孟中关系前景美好
　  李鹏说努力巩固发展中孟友谊
    新华社达卡11月17日电 （记者陈家保）孟加拉国总统艾尔沙德今天晚上在此间总统府举行盛大宴会，为刚在今天下午抵达这里进行正式友好访问的中国总理李鹏洗尘。
    今晚，总统府大厦和花园里张灯结彩。宴会厅正面挂着两国国旗。餐桌上点燃着蜡烛。席间，孟加拉国民族乐队为宾主演奏着孟中两国民歌。
    艾尔沙德总统在宴会上首先致词。他说，李鹏总理的来访象征着中孟两国政府和人民之间十分亲密和兄弟般的关系。在实现两国各自目标的过程中，孟加拉国十分珍视把两国连结在一起的友谊和纽带。
    艾尔沙德说，孟中两国关系的前景是美好的。两国在短暂的时期内就建立了牢固的合作基础，现在这种合作正在扩大。双边合作的潜力还很大。
    他强调，两国联合经济委员会第五次会议刚刚在北京结束。明天，将签署两国长期贸易协定和第12号贸易议定书。将要签署的互免签证协议将使两国间官员往来变得更加容易。这些都表达了两国人民建立更密切联系的愿望。
    他接着列举了不久前两国合作修建的达卡的孟中友谊桥的竣工和北京的中孟友谊小学新校舍的竣工剪彩以及防洪方面的合作等事例，来说明两国合作关系的发展。
    他在谈到国际形势时说，中孟两国对当前的世界有着相似的看法，并为实现共同的目标而进行合作。
    他指出，随着超级大国之间的紧张关系得到缓和，世界其他地区的紧张局势也有所缓和。然而，在非洲、亚洲和中东地区仍然存在着一些突出的麻烦点。
    他重申了孟加拉国在纳米比亚问题、巴勒斯坦问题、阿富汗问题和柬埔寨问题上的原则立场。他在谈到柬埔寨问题时说，只有全面政治解决柬埔寨问题，才能保证柬实现公正、持久的和平。为此，柬有关各方必须恢复对话，所有外国军队必须在联合国监督下撤出柬埔寨。
    他说，贫富国家的差距正在扩大，近期无法解决。我们要靠今后几代人继续进行南北对话，以建立一个公正的国际经济秩序。
    他赞扬中国人民在其领导人强有力的领导下所取得的显著进步。他说：“你们政策的成功体现在贵国近年来取得了突飞猛进的发展。尽管贵国面临着压力和挑战，但仍能保持这种发展速度，这生动地体现了中国领导人的远见卓识和中国社会的内在力量。”
    李鹏在致词中首先对今天达卡人民对他的访问给予的十分热烈而盛情的欢迎表示深受感动。他说，这充分体现了孟加拉国人民对中国人民的友好感情。
    他说：“中孟两国是十分友好的近邻，两国人民之间有着深厚的友谊。1975年中孟建交后，两国关系进入了新的历史时期。十几年来，尽管国际风云变幻，中孟关系一直顺利地向前发展。两国不仅在经贸、科技、文化等领域进行着卓有成效的合作，而且在国际事务中互相支持，密切配合。平等相待，互相信赖，真诚友好，互利合作，已经成为中孟关系的显著特点。”
    他说，艾尔沙德总统是中国人民的老朋友，曾5次访华，为增进中孟友谊作出了重要贡献。不久前，总统夫人罗珊·艾尔沙德也对中国进行了友好访问，并出席了中孟友谊小学新校舍竣工典礼。现在，中孟友谊小学和孟中友谊大桥已经成为中孟友谊的象征，为两国友好关系史增添了光辉的一页。中孟友好完全符合两国人民的根本利益，也有利于亚洲的和平。不断巩固和发展两国友好合作关系，是两国政府一贯的方针。
    李鹏说，他这次访问的重要目的就是为中孟友谊的巩固与发展作出新的努力。他表示深信，他的访问一定能获得圆满成功。
    李鹏说，孟加拉国在艾尔沙德总统的领导下，正在积极探索适合本国国情的发展道路，致力于维护国内团结和统一，发展自己的经济和提高人民生活水平。特别在与洪水灾害的斗争中，孟加拉国人民所表现出的不屈不挠的和敢于与困难作斗争的精神，令人钦佩。
    他说，孟加拉国奉行独立和不结盟的外交政策，在国际事务中坚持原则，伸张正义，发挥着积极作用，赢得了国际社会的好评。
    在谈到南亚地区形势时，李鹏说，南亚各国都是发展中国家，同属第三世界，都面临着维护民族独立和国家主权、发展民族经济和提高人民生活水平的任务。中国希望南亚地区保持稳定，不断繁荣。中国高度赞赏孟加拉国在促进南亚国家睦邻友好、推动南亚区域合作方面所作的不懈努力。中国真诚地希望南亚各国，国家不分大小，都能遵守和平共处五项原则，在此基础上和睦相处，互相尊重、平等协商，妥善地解决国与国之间现存的问题和某些争端，而绝不诉诸武力。
    他指出，“当前国际形势正在发生由紧张转向缓和，由对抗转向对话的积极变化。但同时，也应看到，危及世界和平的不安定因素依然存在。许多地区热点问题还没有得到解决，我们绝不可放松应有的警惕。而且，世界上还存在着不合理的经济秩序。富的国家越来越富，穷的国家越来越穷。许多发展中国家还要为维持本国人民的最低生活水平而进行不懈的努力。
    他说，中国将一如既往奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，愿同孟加拉国以及世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民一道，为维护与促进世界和平与发展，为在和平共处五项原则基础上建立国际政治新秩序和国际经济新秩序作出自己的贡献。
    李鹏和艾尔沙德的讲话博得了全场热烈的掌声。
    宴会前，李鹏与艾尔沙德进行了礼节性拜会。
    孟加拉国副总统穆杜德·艾哈迈德、议长沙姆斯·胡达·乔杜里和总理卡齐·扎法尔·艾哈迈德等出席了宴会。
    随同访问的中国外长钱其琛、对外经贸部长郑拓彬和中国人民解放军副总参谋长何其宗也应邀出席了宴会。
    宴会结束前，孟加拉国艺术家们为中国贵宾表演了精彩的民族歌舞。
