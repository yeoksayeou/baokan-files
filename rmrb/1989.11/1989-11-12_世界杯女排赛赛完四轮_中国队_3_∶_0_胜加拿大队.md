The fourth round of the fifth World Cup Women's Volleyball Tournament concluded today. The Chinese team defeated Canada 3-0, the Soviet Union team defeated East Germany 3-0, the Cuban team defeated Japan 3-0, and the Peruvian team defeated South Korea 3-2.

The Chinese team played comfortably today, finishing the entire match in less than an hour. The scores for the three sets were 15-0, 15-7, and 15-5. Although the Japanese team lost, the players fought tenaciously in front of 15,000 roaring spectators, showcasing exceptional defense and attack. They led in each set multiple times. Due to the Japanese team's tenacious struggle and the pressure from the spectators, some Cuban players performed poorly and lost their composure, making multiple mistakes and receiving one yellow card and one red card.

Local volleyball experts generally believe that the Cuban team has overcome all obstacles and will likely win the championship. The Cuban team's coach expressed an optimistic view. The competition for the runner-up position will be between the Chinese and Soviet teams, and the situation is already clear.

The Peruvian team, which finished second in the Olympics, faced strong resistance from the South Korean team today and narrowly avoided defeat. They fought for nearly two hours before winning 3-2. The scores for the five sets were 4-15, 14-16, 15-9, 15-13, and 15-4.

The fifth round of this tournament will continue tomorrow.

    世界杯女排赛赛完四轮
    中国队3∶0胜加拿大队
    本报大阪11月11日电　记者于青报道：第五届世界杯女排赛今天赛完第四轮，中国队以3∶0胜加拿大队，苏联队3∶0胜民主德国队，古巴队3∶0胜日本队，秘鲁队3∶2胜南朝鲜队。
    中国队今天打得轻松，全场比赛不到一小时，3局的比分是15∶0、15∶7和15∶5。日本队今天虽然输了球，但是队员们在一万五千名观众的震耳欲聋的加油声中，却打得非常顽强，防守和进攻都发挥出了超水平，在每局比赛中都曾数次领先。由于日本队顽强拚搏和观众造成的压力，古巴队个别队员表现失常和失态，多次出现失误并吃一次黄牌和一次红牌。
    此间排坛人士普遍认为，古巴队已冲过所有难关，夺得冠军已不会有什么问题，该队教练表示了乐观的看法。亚军的争夺将在中国队与苏联队之间展开的形势已经明朗。
    奥运会亚军秘鲁队今天遇到了南朝鲜队的顽强抵抗，险些翻船，苦战了近两个小时才以3∶2获胜，5局的比分是4∶15、14∶16、15∶9、15∶13和15∶4。
    本届杯赛的第5轮比赛明天继续在这里举行。
