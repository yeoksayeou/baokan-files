Daxin Station is a major marshalling station on the Tongpu Line, with many passing trains and long stopovers. Therefore, during our work, we often discover that escort personnel sell the goods they are escorting to local residents at this station. On July 20th of this year, a flour car from Yuncheng to Datong stopped at Daxin Station. The escorts, Gao and Jia, sold 5 bags of flour to local residents for 20 yuan each, earning 100 yuan. On August 25th, a sugar car from Linhe to Yuncheng stopped at Daxin Station. During the stopover, the escorts, Gao and Li, sold 5 bags of sugar to local residents for 50 yuan each, earning 250 yuan.

　　押运员私自出卖押运物资
    大新站系同蒲线较大的编组站，过往列车多，停留时间长，因此我们在工作当中，经常发现押运人员在本站私自出卖自己所押的承运物资。今年7月20日，由运城发往大同面粉车一辆，停靠大新站时，押运人高某、贾某以每袋20元卖给当地群众面粉5袋，获人民币100元；8月25日，由临河发运城白糖车一辆，在大新站停留期间，押运人高某、李某以每袋50元卖给当地群众白糖5袋，获人民币250元。
