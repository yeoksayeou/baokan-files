The gestures discussed in this article are not those used in sign language, but rather the unique habits formed by various nations over long periods of history. A French scholar once said, “A nation's culture can be harmed, its surroundings can be destroyed, but the unique gestures of that nation can be preserved, for they are part of civilization, a silent language.”

The renowned comedian Charlie Chaplin also pointed out that our gestures and actions speak. Usually, people say, “Look at your actions, and you can tell where you come from.” This is because the same gesture or action can have different meanings in different countries, and even within the same country, different regions can have different interpretations. It could also be said that the same meaning can be expressed using different gestures or actions in different countries.

For example, making a circle with the thumb and index finger, Americans use this gesture to mean “OK”; people along the Mediterranean coast in France use it to mean “zero” or “nothing”; people in Tokyo use it to mean “money”; while people in Tunisia use it to mean “I’ll kill you.”

Extending the index and middle fingers to form the letter “V” to signify victory is a gesture widely used in the world today. However, did you know that the first person to use this gesture was British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, during World War II? When Philippine President Corazon Aquino won the election, she extended her thumb and index finger to signify victory. This is a typical Filipino gesture, distinguishing her from the previous president, Ferdinand Marcos, who often used the “V” gesture.

Extending the index and little fingers to form the shape of an animal’s “horns” can convey completely different meanings. Italians use this gesture to tell you to move your evil gaze. For the French, it means “green hat,” symbolizing infidelity. Who would have thought that George H.W. Bush and his wife Barbara would make this gesture after taking the oath of office as President and First Lady of the United States, surprising Americans.

Obviously, not just gestures, but also nodding, shrugging, raising hands, walking, touching, and eye contact can all represent speech, and their meanings can vary greatly from country to country. Before takeoff, British flight attendants remind international travelers, “Please note that your gestures and actions may put you in an awkward situation.”

For instance, touching someone’s earlobe is considered an insult in Spain. Greeks see an outstretched open hand as an insult. This shows how different historical traditions can be in different regions. Even the simple actions of saying “yes” or “no” differ: Greeks, Turks, and Bulgarians use a side-to-side head shake to mean “yes,” while people in other parts of the world use this to mean “no.” The way Africans and Asians count with their fingers is different from how Parisians or Washingtonians do it. When Japanese people count, they start with the thumb as “1,” the index finger as “2,” and so on. Once all five fingers are used, they start again with the little finger for numbers 6 through 10. Europeans and Americans, however, start counting again with the thumb. Additionally, placing the index finger on the temple is seen as a sign of stupidity in France, but in the Netherlands, it is seen as a sign of intelligence. In Florence, Italy, placing a finger on the eyelid is seen as a sign of goodwill, but in Spain, it is seen as a sign of distrust, and in France, it is seen as accusing someone of lying.

An Englishman and an Italian standing together can easily be distinguished. Englishmen keep their heads high and make few gestures when talking and do not kiss women in public. Even if they want to scold someone, they will extend two fingers in the British manner, meaning, “Alright, you wait!” Upper-class Englishmen rarely clap during performances; if they do, it is only a light clap, never thunderous applause. Italians, however, are quite different from the English.

When Americans and British people talk to others, they usually maintain a distance of about an arm's length. Germans find this distance insufficient and will back away half a step, feeling that their “personal space” has been invaded. Italians or Saudis, on the other hand, always try to get as close as possible to the person they are talking to. Therefore, British and Italian businessmen often have problems when interacting. The British will back away to maintain the necessary distance, while the Italians will move forward, making both parties uncomfortable.

Americans looking at the French will find their movements graceful and expressive, with unique postures, such as crossing their legs when sitting. Americans, regardless of their status or social position, will relax by putting one leg over the other, even onto a table, and crossing their hands behind their heads. The French, however, would not be so bold.

If you observe carefully, you will see that people from all over the world have their unique gesture languages.

　　手势——无声的语言
　　青波
    本文所谈的手势，当然不是哑语中的手势，而是各国人民在漫长的历史中形成的特殊习惯。一位法国学者说过：“一个民族的文化可以受到侵害，周围环境可以遭到破坏，而这个民族特有的手势却能保存下来，因为它是文明的一部分，是无声的语言。”
    著名喜剧大师卓别林也曾指出，我们的手势、动作是会说话的。通常人们会说：“看看你的动作，就能知道你来自何方。这是因为同样一个手势或动作，在不同的国家有不同的意义，甚至在同一个国家的不同地区都可以有不同的含义。或许还可以反过来讲，同一个意义的事，在不同的国家可用不同的手势或动作来表示。
    伸出一只手，将拇指和食指握成圈，美国人用这个手势表示：“OK”；法国地中海沿岸的人以此表示“零”或者“什么都没有”；东京人代之以
  “钱”；而突尼斯人则用来表示：“我杀了你”。
    伸出食指和中指，组成英文字母“V”，表示胜利，这个手势在当今世界上用得最广。但不知你是否知道，首先用这一手势的是英国首相丘吉尔，是在第二次世界大战期间。菲律宾总统科·阿基诺大选得胜后，伸出拇指和食指，以示胜利。这是典型的菲律宾手势，阿基诺夫人用它，一是表示她将忠诚于民族的传统和国家的独立，二是区别于前总统马科斯常用的手势“V”。
    伸出食指和小指，形似动物的“角”。这一手势可表示绝然不同的意思。意大利人这样做，是让你移开那邪恶的视线。对法国人来讲，这是“绿帽子”的意思。谁能想到，布什和夫人巴尔巴拉宣誓就任美国总统后也做了这个动作，使美国人惊讶不已。
    显然，不仅是手势，就是摇头，耸肩，举手，投足，走步，接触，眼神都能代表说话，而且其意思在不同的国家都很不相同。英国空中小姐在飞机起飞前会提醒出国旅行的乘客：
  “请注意，你们的举止动作都有可能使你们处于难堪的境地。”
    举例来说，触摸别人的耳垂，西班牙人认为这是一种侮辱。希腊人把向他伸出张开的手看作是侮辱。这说明不同地区的历史传统有多么大的差异。就拿最简单的表示“是”或“不是”的动作来说，希腊人、土耳其人、保加利亚人都以左右摇头表示“是”，而世界其它地区的人都认为这表示“不是”。非洲人和亚洲人用手指数数就同巴黎人或者华盛顿人不一样。日本人伸开手，弯曲拇指是“1”，食指是“2”，以此类推，当5个手指用完，再往下数时，必然从伸小拇指开始，再从6数到10，欧美人则重新从大拇指开始。再说，将食指放在鬓角处，在法国这是当作愚蠢的表示，而在荷兰就认为这是聪明的表示；在意大利的佛罗伦萨人看来，将手指放在眼皮上，是表示善意，西班牙人将此动作看作是不信任，法国人会认为，这是把他当说谎者。
    一个英国人和一个意大利人站在一起，很容易将他们区别开来。英国人谈话时，将脑袋高仰，动作很少，也不会当众亲吻女人。即使他想教训人，也会按英国人的习惯，对你伸出两只手指，意思是说：
  “好，你等着瞧！”上层社会的英国人在观看演出时，很少鼓掌，即使鼓掌，也只是轻拍两下，从来不会有雷鸣般的掌声。意大利人则同英国人迥然不同。
    美国人和英国人同别人讲话时，一般都要保持一手长的距离。德国人觉得这一距离还不够，会认为他的“私人领域”受到了侵犯，因此必定会后退半步。碰到意大利人或沙特人就糟了，他们总想尽量靠近对话者。所以英国商人和意大利商人交往时往往会出问题。英国人为保持必要的距离会往后缩，意大利人此时会向前靠，使两者都感到别扭。
    美国人看法国人，会发现他们的动作文雅优美，富有表情，而且有特有的姿势，比如说，坐时定会交叉双腿。而美国人，不论其身份和社会地位如何，为了放松会将一条腿搁在另一条腿上，甚至搁到桌子上，同时将双手交叉在脑后。法国人显然不大会如此放肆。
  只要你能细心观察，就会看到世界各地的人民都有各自独特的手势语言。
