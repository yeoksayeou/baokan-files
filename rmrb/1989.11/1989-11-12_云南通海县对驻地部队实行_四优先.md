Yunnan Tonghai County has consistently implemented the "four priorities" policy for stationed troops, providing strong support for military construction.

First, priority is given to arranging employment for military spouses. Second, children of military personnel are given priority in childcare and school admissions. Third, retiring military officers are given priority in resettlement, and are provided with certain benefits in housing, transportation, and wages. Fourth, priority is given in the supply of daily necessities. Staples such as grain, oil, pork, vegetables, coal for daily use, and daily necessities are ensured to be supplied to the military first, meeting their needs. Last year, after the prices of some goods were adjusted, the county decided to allocate nearly 10,000 yuan annually from the budget to subsidize the price difference, allowing the military to continue purchasing coal and pork at prices lower than the market rate, ensuring that their living standards do not decline.

    云南通海县对驻地部队实行“四优先”
    本报讯　云南省通海县坚持对驻地部队实行“四优先”，有力地支持了部队建设。
    一是优先安排随军家属就业。二是接收部队子女入托、入学优先。三是安置转业干部优先，并在住房、交通、工资等方面给予一定的照顾。四是在生活物资上供应优先。粮油、猪肉、蔬菜、生活用煤和日用品等物资做到优先供给部队，按需保障。去年，部分物资价格调整后，县里决定每年从财政拨出近万元，用于补贴调价后的价差部分，让部队继续购买低于市场价格的生活用煤和猪肉，保证生活水平不下降。　（刘德安　郭云疆）
