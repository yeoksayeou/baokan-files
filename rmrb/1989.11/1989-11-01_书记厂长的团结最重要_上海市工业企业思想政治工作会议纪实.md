The recent Shanghai Municipal Industrial Enterprise Ideological and Political Work Conference concluded with a lively atmosphere. The most active speakers in the group discussions were mostly secretaries and managers. The key issue this conference aimed to address was the unity between the two crucial figures in running an enterprise: the secretary and the manager.

In the past, we said that the enterprise should revolve around the manager, and this is also written in the Enterprise Law. Now, we emphasize that the Party Committee is the political leadership core of the enterprise, leading to a debate between "center" and "core."

The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have a clear understanding of this issue. The manager responsibility system must be upheld, with the manager playing a central role in enterprise operations and production. However, to strengthen Party leadership and Party building, the political leadership of the enterprise should be centered around the Party Committee, which is only natural. These two "hearts" can be unified in essence.

Some managers struggle to understand this, often focusing too much on the size of their authority. How should this issue be viewed? The manager of the Coral Chemical Factory put it well during a group discussion: "The manager, who is at the center of enterprise operations and production, should not think about who has more authority when hearing about the political core role of the Party organization. My understanding is that as a Party member and a member of the factory Party Committee, the manager is also within this core and should play a good role in the political core."

So, does this mean that managers no longer need to handle ideological and political work? No. The municipal Party Committee leaders stated at the conference: "We oppose the idea that implementing the manager responsibility system means excluding the Party Committee's leadership in ideological and political work. We also need to prevent the idea that strengthening the Party Committee's leadership in ideological and political work means negating the managers' and administrative cadres' responsibility in this area. Strengthening and improving ideological and political work requires both the Party Committee secretary and the manager to jointly shoulder this responsibility from their respective positions." This opinion was widely agreed upon by the more than 800 managers and secretaries who attended the conference.

Has the manager's authority over personnel been weakened? No. Based on Jiang Zemin's repeated speeches, the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government believe that managers have the authority over personnel, which does not mean that they can make decisions alone in personnel appointments. A politically astute manager will necessarily discuss with the Party Committee secretary and other Party and government leaders in the collective leadership to make good decisions.

During the conference discussions, everyone felt that studying Marxist philosophy was urgent. This is not just to establish a scientific worldview but also to master the correct methods of thinking and avoid the one-sidedness of metaphysics. The characteristic of the metaphysical method of thinking is to take things to extremes and fail to see the inherent unity of things. For example, when it is said that the Party Committee should become the political leadership core, it is assumed that the manager's central position is gone, either this or that, failing to see that the essence of the two "hearts" is unified. In the past, emphasizing the manager as the center meant sidelining the secretary. Of course, we should not reverse this now, making the secretary hot and the manager cold. We need to prevent this one-sidedness.

It can be said that many advanced enterprises in Shanghai have always had good unity between their managers and secretaries, otherwise, they would not have become advanced enterprises. The conference distributed some typical experiences from these enterprises, fully confirming this point. Their common experience is: the manager respects the secretary and discusses major issues with the secretary; the secretary respects the manager and helps the manager overcome difficulties, and both sides voluntarily adhere to the principles of democratic centralism.

Therefore, the personal qualities of the secretary and manager are decisive in strengthening unity. Municipal Party Committee Secretary and Mayor Zhu Rongji particularly emphasized this point. He said: "For the manager and secretary to work well together, the most important thing is to improve their own qualities: first, they must have strong Party spirit; second, they must have good work styles, be democratic, link theory with practice, and be willing to engage in criticism and self-criticism; third, they must have high levels of competence, be diligent in learning, and improve their ideological and professional levels. Once the managers and secretaries improve their qualities and maintain high standards, they can manage strictly and truly take on ideological and political work."

    书记厂长的团结最重要
    ——上海市工业企业思想政治工作会议纪实
    本报记者　章世鸿
    最近结束的上海市工业企业思想政治工作会议，气氛十分热烈。小组会上发言最活跃的大多是书记和厂长。这次会议所要解决的关键问题，就是书记和厂长这两个办好企业的关键人物的团结问题。
    过去我们说，企业以厂长为中心，《企业法》上也是这样写的。现在又强调党委是企业政治领导核心，于是就出现了“中心”与“核心”之争。
    上海市委、市政府对这个问题的认识是明确的。厂长负责制必须坚持，厂长应在企业经营和生产中处于中心地位。但为了加强党的领导，加强党的建设，企业的政治领导应以党委为核心，这是很自然的。这两个“心”在本质上是完全可以统一起来的。
    有些厂长转不过弯子来，无非是在权力大小上考虑过多。怎样看待这个问题呢？珊瑚化工厂厂长在小组讨论中说得好：“在企业经营生产中处于中心地位的厂长，不能一听到强调党组织的政治核心作用就想到中心、核心哪个大，去同书记比高低。我的理解是，厂长作为党员、厂党委委员，也在这个核心里面，要把核心的政治作用发挥好。”这正是一个社会主义企业的厂长应有的态度。
    那么，厂长今后就可以不再抓思想政治工作了吗？不是。市委领导在大会上指出：“我们既反对一讲实行厂长负责制，就排斥党委对思想政治工作的领导责任；也要注意防止一讲加强党委对思想政治工作的领导，就否定厂长和行政干部抓思想政治工作。加强和改进思想政治工作，需要党委书记和厂长在不同岗位上，共同承担起这个责任来。”这个意见，参加会议的800多位厂长和书记都十分赞成。
    厂长的用人权削弱了吗？也不是。根据江泽民同志多次讲话，市委和市府认为，厂长有用人权，不能理解为在干部任免问题上，可以一个人说了算。一个有政治水平的厂长，在任命干部的时候，他必然要和党委书记一起，在党政领导集体里面很好地讨论。
    会议讨论中，大家认为学习马克思主义哲学非常迫切。这不仅仅为了树立科学的世界观，也为了掌握正确的思想方法，防止形而上学的片面性。形而上学思想方法的特点就是凡事走极端，看不到事物内在的统一性。例如，一说党委要成为政治领导核心，就以为厂长的中心地位没有了，非此即彼，看不到两“心”的实质是统一的。过去强调厂长为中心，就把书记晾在一边。当然，现在也不要再倒转来，热了书记，凉了厂长。我们要防止这种片面性。
    应该说，上海许多先进企业的厂长和书记历来是团结得比较好的，否则就不可能成为先进企业。大会发的一些企业的典型经验充分证实了这一点。他们的共同经验是：厂长尊重书记，大事都同书记商量；书记尊重厂长，帮助厂长排除困难，双方自觉遵守民主集中制的原则。
    因此，书记和厂长的个人素质在加强团结问题上具有决定性的意义。市委书记、市长朱熔基特别强调这一点。他说：“厂长、书记要配合好，最重要的是提高自己的素质：一是要党性强；二是作风好，有民主作风、理论联系实际、勇于开展批评和自我批评；三是水平高，勤于学习，提高思想水平和业务水平。厂长书记素质提高了，一身正气，就能从严管理，把思想政治工作真正抓起来。”
