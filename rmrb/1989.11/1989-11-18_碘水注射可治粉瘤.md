Iodine Injection Can Treat Sebaceous Cysts

BEIJING, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) — Liu Huacheng, deputy director of the outpatient department at the Beijing General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force, has developed a new method for treating sebaceous cysts through years of clinical practice and research. His iodine injection therapy recently won a military science and technology progress invention award.

Sebaceous cysts are a common condition, particularly among young men and women. Traditionally, both domestically and internationally, surgical excision has been the primary treatment method. The iodine injection treatment involves first locally anesthetizing the top of the cyst, then using a needle to drain the powdery substance inside. Afterward, a 3% iodine solution is injected into the cyst. The cure rate exceeds 95%, with no side effects and no scarring on the skin.

     碘水注射可治粉瘤
    本报讯  空军北京总医院门诊部副主任刘华钦，经多年的临床摸索和实践，研究出一种治疗粉瘤的新方法——碘水注射疗法，最近获得了军队科研进步发明奖。
    粉瘤是一种常见病，尤见于青年男女。过去国内外长期采用手术切除的方法治疗。碘水注射治疗法，先是局部麻醉粉瘤顶部，再用针头穿刺，排净囊内粉状物，尔后向囊内注入百分之三的碘水。治愈率达百分之九十五以上，无副作用，皮肤不留斑痕。
