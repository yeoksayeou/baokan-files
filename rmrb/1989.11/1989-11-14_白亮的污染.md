While air, water, noise, and other forms of pollution are widely condemned, another type of pollution is making its way onto the streets, into plazas, and into residential areas, cloaked in a bright white garment. Especially during the scorching summer months, in offices, homes... it can descend from the sky like a demon, instantly making your eyes sting painfully and your body feel as if it's in a furnace. You end up drenched in sweat, exhausted, dizzy, and restless. To escape it, you cover your windows with thick curtains, blocking out the fresh air outside, lighting lamps during the day, and turning on fans and air conditioners to their highest settings. But the air becomes stagnant and suffocating, and you wish you could escape outside. However, once you leave your home, you find it lurking on the streets and in plazas. Unless you can flee to a distant forest or green space, it will catch you. This type of pollution can be hindered by green barriers, but it cannot be stopped from wreaking havoc from above, as humanity has yet to fully understand its malevolence and find effective ways to combat it.

Even worse, because it rides on the modern vehicles of white and bright light that humans have created for it, its ranks are growing, and its harm is becoming more severe.

What is this pollution?

It is a pollution that can be even more terrifying than water or air pollution. While water and air pollution can be broken down, diluted, and eventually eliminated through modern scientific methods, this pollution is a product of nature and human collusion, making it difficult to control until humans recognize its evil and decisively cut it off.

What exactly is this pollution?

It is the reflective pollution caused by white paint, mirror-like glass, aluminum alloys, and stainless steel exteriors on buildings under the sun. We all know that the reflectance (P) of white-painted surfaces is 69-80%, and exceptionally smooth white-painted surfaces can reach 92%. The reflectance of mirror-like glass is 82-88%, roughly ten times higher than that of grasslands, forests, or dark-colored or rough-textured brick and stone buildings. In other words, the light and heat reflected by the former are about ten times greater than that of the latter. Because this value far exceeds the range that the human body can adapt to, it becomes pollution, endangering human life and health. Especially with the appearance of high-rise and super-high-rise buildings made of white and bright materials, this harm is even more severe.

Therefore, some enlightened individuals believe that the inventions and innovations of white and bright material manufacturers, as well as the novelty and self-expression of the white and bright factions, are essentially driven by personal gain and an uncontrollable desire for self-expression. Seriously speaking, this is a wrong path in the development of modern civilization!

For this type of pollution, we not only need a strict law to restrain it but also need our architects and urban planners to thoroughly update their concepts, prioritizing service to people as their highest work principle. They should take concrete actions (such as prohibiting the use of high-reflectance materials for the exteriors of high-rise and super-high-rise buildings; increasing vertical greening; minimizing the use of highly reflective hard surfaces, etc.) to reduce and prevent the human-induced regeneration of this pollution source.

    白亮的污染
    洪铁城
    当着空气、水、噪声等等污染像“过街老鼠人人喊打”的时候，另有一种污染，却披着白色闪亮的大氅阔笑着走上街头，走进广场，走进小区。特别是炎夏酷暑时节，在办公室、在居室……它会像妖魔鬼怪一样从天而降，霎时间把你的眼睛刺得火辣辣的生疼，身子如同置于炉前灶房一样热烘烘地难受。你因此大汗淋漓，精疲力竭，头昏眼花，坐立不安。为了躲避它，你用厚厚的帘布把窗口堵得严严实实，拒清新于屋外，白日里开灯采光，电扇、空调器全都开到最高档，但空气混浊，闷得发慌，你恨不得逃出屋外。然而，逃出家门，逃到街头，逃至广场，你又马上发现它死死地盯着你，跟踪着你。如果你没有办法逃到遥远的森林、绿地，躲藏起来，它会毫不犹豫地逮住你。这种污染，绿色的屏障虽然可以绊住它的双脚，但缚不住它在高空发泄淫威的翅膀，因为人类还没有完全认识它的恶毒，还没有着手研究制伏它的好办法。
    更有甚者，因为它是驭着人类为它配制的白色光亮的现代坐骑踏上世界的，所以它的队伍越来越壮大，它的危害越来越严重。
    这是什么污染？！
    这是可以说比水、比空气之类污染更可怕的污染。因为水和空气的污染，可以通过现代科学的方法进行分解、稀释，直至消除，而它是自然和人徇私结合后降生的孽障，所以在人没有认识它并下决心与之一刀两断之前，很难制伏。
    到底是什么污染？
    是白色派、光亮派的白色粉刷、镜面玻璃、铝合金、不锈钢外装修建筑在阳光下所产生的反射污染。
    我们大家知道，白色粉刷面的反射系数P是69—80％，特别光洁的白色粉刷面可达92％，镜面玻璃的反射系数P是82—88％，约比草地、森林、深色或毛面砖石外装修建筑物反射系数大十倍左右。换言之，即前者反射给人的光和热比后者大十倍左右。因为这个值大大超过了人的生理适应范围，所以它成了污染，危及了人的生命健康。特别是白色、光亮材料装修的高层超高层建筑的出现，这种危害就更严重。
    因此有识者认为，白色、光亮材料制造商的发明创造，白色派、光亮派的标新立异，自我表现、自我欣赏，实质上考虑的只是自己发财，自己无端地发泄表现欲。严肃地说，这是现代文明发展的一条歧途！
    对于这种污染，我们不但需要一部天网恢恢的法律去捆住它的手脚，同时需要我们的建筑师、城市设计师们彻底地更新观念，把为人服务列为最高的工作准则去理解去努力，用具体的行动（例如高层超高层建筑上禁用反射系数大的材料作外装修；增加垂直绿化；把反射性强的硬质地面缩到最小最小的程度等等）减少、防止这种污染源人为地再生。
