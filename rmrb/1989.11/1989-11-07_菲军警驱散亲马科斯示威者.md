Philippine military and police forces early on the 4th forcibly dispersed about five thousand pro-Marcos supporters who had gathered overnight in front of the Constabulary headquarters at Camp Crame.

On October 24, approximately three hundred pro-Marcos supporters set out from Marcos' hometown of Batac in the northern province of Ilocos Norte, beginning an eleven-day, 400-kilometer "March for Justice." Their goal was to demand that the government allow Marcos' remains to be repatriated and buried in the Philippines. By the time this group reached Manila on the 3rd, it had swelled to about 25,000 people.

Philippine Vice President Salvador Laurel, opposition Senator Raul Roco, and several officials from the former Marcos government participated in the demonstration. Laurel also delivered a speech at a rally held in the nearby city of Quezon.

The marchers ignored a military ban and, with several thousand people, broke through the barricades formed by armed military police and fire trucks, reaching the gates of Camp Crame.

On October 27, the Philippine Supreme Court had issued a final ruling prohibiting the repatriation and burial of Marcos' remains in the Philippines.

    菲军警驱散亲马科斯示威者
    菲律宾军警四日凌晨强行驱散了五千名彻夜聚集在保安军总部克拉梅军营前示威的前总统马科斯的追随者。
    十月二十四日，约三百名亲马科斯者从马科斯家乡北依罗戈省的巴塔克市出发，开始了历时十一天、行程四百公里的
  “正义行军”，旨在要求政府允许马科斯遗体回国安葬。三日这支队伍抵达马尼拉市时，已扩大到约二点五万人。
    菲律宾副总统劳雷尔、反对党参议员恩里莱及原马科斯政府的一些官员参加了示威，劳雷尔还在马尼拉近郊奎松市举行的游行集会上发表了演说。
    游行队伍无视军方禁令，有几千人冲破了武装军警和消防车筑成的防线，到达克拉梅军营门前。
    十月二十七日，菲律宾最高法院已宣布一项终审裁决，禁止马科斯的遗体回国安葬。
