    Beijing has successfully extracted mineral water that has been buried underground for over ten thousand years. The "Xidebao" brand beverage, developed by the Beijing Yongdingmen Granary Natural Mineral Water Beverage Factory and dubbed the "Ten Thousand Year Old Cellar," has recently passed inspection and entered mass production.

    The mineral water used in "Xidebao" has been determined by the Water Resources and Geological Engineering Geology Bureau of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources to be over ten thousand years old. Due to the well depth of over two thousand meters, the water quality has not been affected by any pollution.
