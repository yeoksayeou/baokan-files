In the area around Taoyuan Road in Taiyuan City, one often sees groups of young people carrying bright red youth league flags, going from street to street, setting up stalls, and providing free services to passersby. Among them, some repair gas stoves, televisions, radios, and bicycles; some weld basins, some give haircuts, some measure blood pressure and test blood types...

Under a large tree by the roadside, a red flag is fluttering, and a young person is busily welding a broken basin underneath. A crowd has gathered around. Soon, an elderly retired worker pushes his way out of the crowd. He is holding a newly welded basin and excitedly says to the people around him, "The bottom of my basin had a hole in it. I walked several streets and couldn't find anyone to weld it. Look, these young people did such a good job!"

Not far from the tree, a few young people are tinkering with a television set. Nearby, a retired cadre repeatedly tells his companions, "You can rest assured and let them repair it! My black-and-white television set has been bought for more than a dozen years, and now it often can't receive the programs I want to watch. The other day, the service team came to my doorstep and repaired it for free. It took less than half an hour to fix it. Isn't this the spirit of Leifeng coming back?"

These "Living Leifengs" are the youth league members of the Taiyuan Gasification Company. This company is the first comprehensive coal utilization enterprise in the country, with 12 subsidiaries and 10,000 employees, including 6,500 young people and 1,898 youth league members. At the beginning of this year, the company's youth league committee, in response to the "money-first" mentality in society, proposed to carry out voluntary services for the people and restore the advanced image of the youth league members.

In addition to setting up 85 quality service stations within the company and carrying out more than 20 service projects, all the youth league members also take turns going out to the streets and into people's homes to provide various small repairs for the public. They do not smoke, drink water, or accept gifts from the people when they go to people's homes. If they cannot repair the items, they take them back to repair and then deliver them back after completion. Since this year, they have taken turns going out to the streets 8 times, repaired more than 15,000 stoves and other items, repaired more than 300 bicycles, conducted health check-ups for more than 800 people, and provided various consultation services for 7,280 people.

    团旗飘飘
    新华社记者　惠金义
    在太原市桃园路一带，经常可以看到一队队青年打着鲜红的团旗，走街串巷，摆摊设点，义务为过往群众服务。他们中有的修理煤气灶、电视机、收音机、自行车；有的焊脸盆，有的理发，有的量血压、化验血型……
    路旁大树上飘着一面红旗，树下一位青年埋头焊着破脸盆，周围挤满了人。不久，一位退休老工人模样的人从人群中挤出来，他手里拿着一只刚焊好的脸盆，兴奋地对周围的人说：“我家的脸盆底子上烂了个洞，走了几条街，都没找到焊家。您瞧，这些青年人焊得多好。”
    离大树不远的地方，几个青年人正摆弄着一架电视机，旁边一位退休干部再三地对几个同伴说：“你们放心叫他们修吧！我的一台黑白电视机买下十二三年了，现在常收不到想看的节目。前不久服务队到我家门口，免费给我修理，不到半小时就修好了。你们说，这不是雷锋精神又回来了吗！”
    这些“活雷锋”是太原煤气化公司的团员们。这个公司是全国第一个煤炭综合利用的大型联合企业，下属12个单位、1万名职工，其中有6500名青年，团员1898人。今年初，公司团委针对社会上“一切向钱看”的思想，提出开展义务为民服务活动，恢复团员的先进形象。
    他们除了在公司内设立了85个优质服务岗，开展了二三十个服务项目外，全体团员还轮流走上街头，深入到户，为群众搞各种小修理。他们到群众家里不吸烟、不喝水、不接受群众礼品。修不好的物件，带回去修理，修好后再送来。今年以来，已轮流上街8次，修理灶具等1.5万多台（件），修理自行车300多辆，体检800多人次，各种咨询服务7280人次。
