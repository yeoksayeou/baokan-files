Currently, amidst widespread praise, the trend of using public funds for extravagant banquets has somewhat subsided. However, some restaurants and banquet halls that have long relied on public business are facing difficulties. How to adapt to this change? The Zhenjiang Catering Service Company in Jiangsu Province has explored a new path by focusing on the masses and adopting a "five-supplement" strategy. Despite a significant drop in public banquets this year, their business revenue has increased by nearly 40%.

As the main channel for the catering industry, the Zhenjiang Catering Service Company almost encompasses all the famous, large, and specialty restaurants in the city. Company General Manager Wang Dongsheng said: In the past few years, the catering industry earned a lot from public spending. Although our business was good, we didn't feel secure. Now, the Party has decided to promote clean governance, and the catering industry should return to its original position, serving the broad consumer base.

This was the starting point for the company's decision-makers to propose the "five-supplement" strategy at the end of 1988 to prevent the catering industry from declining. Specifically, the first is to supplement large with small, i.e., to make up for the lack of high-end dishes with small portions, small varieties, and low prices; it is clearly stipulated that each restaurant must offer at least 10 dishes priced at 2 yuan or less for customers. The second is to supplement whole with retail, i.e., to make up for the lack of banquet business with individual customers and à la carte dishes. The third is to supplement old with new, i.e., to make up for the lack of customer service measures when focusing on public business by introducing new varieties, new outlets, new projects, and new methods. The fourth is to supplement internal with external, i.e., to make up for the lack of in-store business with street vending, setting up stalls, home cooking services, and home delivery. The fifth is to supplement cooked with fresh, i.e., to make up for the lack of cooked dishes with semi-finished products and communal dishes. This year, the company has made the "five-supplement" strategy a mandatory task for all restaurants and has used it as the content for labor competitions. The century-old restaurant Yuansheng Hall has broken out of the confines of famous dishes and famous snacks, successively launching 32 medium and low-end varieties, and prominently displaying that all dishes priced at 2 yuan or less will have an additional 10% discount. The Sino-foreign joint venture Jingqiao Hotel has set aside its large restaurant image and established a small sales booth of only 3 square meters, insisting on supplying semi-finished products, with daily sales ranging from a few thousand yuan to over ten thousand yuan. The Tongxinglou Restaurant, located in the city center, has sent out famous chefs to open branches in suburban counties. The specialty restaurant Yizhichun has partnered with schools to supply and deliver dishes. Practice has proven that the "five-supplement" business strategy has shown good social benefits and significant economic benefits, and it is praised as a "tonic" for the current catering industry.

　　镇江饮食业走出新路

    当前，在一片叫好声中，公款吃喝风，吹得不那末硬了，可做惯了公家上门生意的一些饭店酒家却发生了一些困难。如何适应这一变化？江苏省镇江市饮食服务公司摸索出一条面向大众、以“五补”为主的经营新路。尽管今年公款宴席比去年下降很多，营业额却上升了将近4成。
    做为饮食业的主渠道，镇江市饮服公司几乎集中了该市同行业所有的名店、大店和特店。公司总经理汪冬生说：前几年，饮食业赚公家钱多，那时，我们的生意虽说好做，但是心里不踏实。现在，党下决心搞廉政建设，饮食业也该回到它原来的位置上来，面对广大消费者了。
    这正是公司的决策者们1988年底就提出以“五补”来防止饮食业滑坡的出发点。具体说来，一是以小补大。即以小规格、小品种、小价格弥补高档菜大生意的不足；明确规定每个店都必须有10个2元以内的菜肴供应顾客；二是以零补整。即以零星顾客、点单菜肴补酒席筵宴少的不足；三是以新补老。即以新品种、新网点、新项目、新办法弥补过去一心做公家生意时，在为民服务措施上的不足；四是以外补内。即以走街串巷、设摊出担、上门掌厨、送菜入户等店外生意弥补店内生意的不足；五是以生补熟。即以半制成品和盆菜弥补熟菜业务的不足。今年以来，公司将“五补”作为硬任务下达各店，并以此为内容开展劳动竞赛。百年老店宴春酒楼，跳出名菜名点的框子，先后推出中低档品种32个，并挂牌告示凡2元以内的小品种再让利10％。中外合资的京侨饭店，放下大店架子，设立了一个只有3平米的售货亭，坚持供应半制成品，日营业额少则几千元，多达上万元。位于市中心的同兴楼菜馆派出名厨高手，将分店开到了郊区县中。特色酒家一枝春，与学校挂钩供应，送点上门。实践证明，以“五补”为主的经营方针，显示出良好的社会效益和显著的经济效益，它被誉为当前饮食业的“补药”。　　　　原载《市场报》
