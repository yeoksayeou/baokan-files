After Criticism

We are pleased to report that the environment at the Zhongxin Primary School in Qiaojiang Town has significantly improved. On May 14, 1988, your newspaper published a letter and photographs on the fifth page, highlighting the noisy environment at the school, which made it difficult for students to concentrate on their studies. The leaders of the county committee, county government, and county political consultative conference took this matter seriously. Under the leadership of the county government, several departments, including the county education commission, county construction commission, and county industry and commerce bureau, jointly raised over 140,000 yuan to build a three-story teaching building for the school. The construction is now complete, and the building has been handed over for use. The environment at Zhongxin Primary School has been greatly improved.

    喜看教学楼
    1988年5月14日你报第五版刊登读者来信和照片，说的是我县桥江镇中心小学环境太闹，学生无法上课。县委、县政府、县政协的领导同志对此非常重视，由县政府牵头，县教委、县建委、县工商局等几家筹资14万多元，为中心小学建了一幢三层教学楼。现在，教学楼已竣工交付使用，桥江镇中心小学环境得到改善。
