Argentina and Britain will hold talks in Uruguay's capital, Montevideo, from December 4 to 6 this year to seek the restoration of diplomatic relations that have been severed for seven years.

This news was announced by Uruguay's Foreign Minister Luis Barrios Tassano in a radio broadcast on the 7th.

He said that this round of talks will be technical in nature. The two sides will exchange views on some outstanding issues. It is reported that the Montevideo talks will also arrange the agenda for the second round of talks scheduled to be held in Madrid next February.

    阿英将在乌拉圭会谈
    阿根廷和英国将于今年十二月四日至六日在乌拉圭首都蒙得维的亚举行会谈，以寻求恢复两国中断七年的外交关系。
    这一消息是乌拉圭外长路易斯·巴里奥斯·塔索诺七日对电台发表谈话时宣布的。
    他说，这次会谈将是一次技术性会谈。会谈双方将就一些悬而未决的问题交换意见。据透露，蒙得维的亚会谈还将安排拟定于明年二月在马德里举行的第二轮会谈的日程。
