Liu Donghan, a major bribery and corruption case in Guangzhou, who refused to surrender, was arrested by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau at midnight today.

Liu Donghan was originally the director of the Materials Supply Department of the Guangzhou Fuel General Company. Taking advantage of the coal supply shortage in Guangzhou in 1988, he used his authority over coal allocation quotas to repeatedly extort bribes from units and individuals in need of coal, amounting to a large sum. After the issuance of the "Notice" by the two courts, relevant departments had repeatedly persuaded and urged him to surrender to the procuratorial organs to seek lenient treatment. However, the criminal refused to surrender.

Public security personnel searched his home and found a total of 66,000 yuan in RMB and various vouchers, bonds, 8,000 Hong Kong dollars, and 3 boxes of obscene videotapes.
