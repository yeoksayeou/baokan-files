The style of the pine tree endures forever — deeply remembering Comrade Tao Zhu on the 20th anniversary of his death

Today, November 30th, marks the 20th anniversary of the passing of Comrade Tao Zhu, an outstanding leader of our Party and state, a loyal Communist warrior tested by time, and a revolutionary of the proletariat. He was cruelly persecuted by Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" and died unjustly. Remembering his life, his fearless and selfless revolutionary spirit for communism; his bold and decisive leadership as a proletarian politician; his spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people; all stand vividly before us. In his article "The Style of the Pine Tree," Tao Zhu wrote: "Every time I see a pine tree, I think of its lofty style, and I associate it with the communist style. I think that the communist style should be one that demands little from people but gives much to people. The communist style should be one that, for the sake of the people's interests and cause, fears no sacrifice."

Comrade Tao Zhu's thoughts are still shining brightly today in this new historical period, inspiring later generations to press forward.

I

During the period when Comrade Tao Zhu led the Central-South Bureau, he worked closely with us day and night, guiding us with his words and deeds. What we felt most deeply was that he was good at handling issues from the height of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and from actual conditions. He often made correct decisions.

In 1960, the Central-South Bureau was established at a time when China's national economy was facing its greatest difficulties. The five provinces (regions) under the jurisdiction of the Central-South Bureau—Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi—were severely affected by natural disasters, and the grain problem weighed heavily on everyone's minds. Saving the people from hunger became the top priority for the entire Party. Comrade Tao Zhu was appointed as the First Secretary of the Central-South Bureau at this critical time, and the burden on his shoulders was indeed very heavy. At that time, Henan Province was the most severely affected by the grain shortage. The shocking "Shenqiu Incident," where people starved to death, occurred in the Shenqiu region of Henan. Upon hearing the news, Tao Zhu was deeply concerned and immediately led an investigation team to Shenqiu to conduct an on-site investigation.

During the period of the people's communes and the Great Leap Forward, Suiping County in Shenqiu had been a model of national progress. The first people's commune in the country was established in Suiping County at Shizhuang Mountain. The first "satellite" of 70,000 jin of wheat per mu was launched in Shizhuang Mountain. At that time, many cadres were suspicious of this and were criticized. However, during this difficult period, the disaster here was particularly severe. The investigation in Suiping County further shocked and made Tao Zhu think deeply. He deeply felt that after the Great Leap Forward and the anti-rightist campaign, the wind of exaggeration was rampant. The higher-ups could not grasp the real situation, and within the Party and outside the Party, there were few who dared to speak the truth and honestly reflect the situation. Not knowing the real situation and making decisions is very dangerous. On February 12, 1961, Tao Zhu specially rushed to Zhengzhou and at the Henan Provincial Party Committee's meeting of cadres at three levels said, "In the past few years, the main problem is that we have not considered the actual situation and have only acted according to our subjective wishes. Accumulation and consumption should have a certain proportion, but in the past two years, we have not studied this issue much and have done whatever we wanted to do." He then used the Great Leap Forward as a lesson to criticize and examine the mistakes of "leveling and adjusting" and "poverty transition," urging the Provincial Party Committee to take measures to overcome the current serious difficulties.

In the spring of 1961, Chairman Mao held a meeting in Guangzhou to discuss and formulate the "Sixty Articles" for rural people's communes, deciding to adjust rural economic policies and appointing Tao Zhu as the chairman of the drafting committee for the "Sixty Articles," with Wang Renzhong and others as deputy chairmen. To grasp the first-hand materials, Tao Zhu returned to his hometown, Qiyang County, Hunan Province, in May. On the same day, despite the fatigue from the long bus ride, he went deep into the Stone Gate Commune's Stone Peak Brigade's four production teams to inspect the public canteens. Tao Zhu asked the commune members, "Is it convenient to eat in the public canteen?" The farmers present, seeing the provincial and county secretaries who came with him, unanimously answered, "It's convenient." Tao Zhu smiled and said, "How is that? I am Tao Maozi, you know!" (Tao Zhu's nickname in his hometown when he was young). "You don't tell the truth to this old friend from Qiyang?" He chatted with his fellow villagers, "Eating in the public canteen, with so many men, women, and children, some want to eat dry food, some want to eat porridge, and the tastes are not the same. Besides, even raising a pig at home requires leftover food. Is it really convenient? What policies are good and what are bad, you can tell me whatever you think." Seeing Tao Zhu so sincere and approachable, the farmers began to speak one after another. Some said, "What a good thing! Now the public canteen can hardly even provide soup, let alone leftover food to feed pigs!" In the Ruyang Commune, Tao Zhu saw a few passing farmers and greeted them, "Where are you from?" A farmer said, "From Panjiabu." Tao Zhu said, "We are fellow villagers, do you know me?" The farmer said, "I haven't seen you, I don't know you." Tao Zhu introduced himself, "I am Tao Zhu, from Shiyuan Cave." The farmer, upon hearing that it was Tao Zhu, put down his pole and sat down with Tao Zhu on the side of the road, chatting. Tao Zhu discovered that some of them had edema, and he stood up, walked to their side, and touched their swollen legs one by one, saying heavily, "Panjiabu is a good place, but it has become like this. It is our work that has not been done well! I am sorry to everyone!" Tao Zhu's listening to the farmers' opinions in Qiyang gave him a clear idea of how to adjust the series of rural economic policies such as rural distribution, production responsibility system, and public canteens, which played a good role in the formulation of the "Sixty Articles" document later.

After his investigation and research in his hometown of Qiyang, he went to Longsheng County, Guangxi, with Comrade Wang Renzhong to conduct an investigation. He learned that a production team of only seven households of farmers in a mountainous area changed the one-size-fits-all management method in production and implemented a management method of land to the household and responsibility to the person, with high enthusiasm and increasing production year after year. He and Comrade Wang Renzhong jointly wrote a report to the Central Committee, proposing that in the management of people's communes, agricultural production teams can be established, and a field management method of linking production, responsibility to the person, and rewarding overproduction can be implemented. Chairman Mao praised this investigation report and instructed, "The analysis in this document is Marxist, and the opinions proposed after the analysis are also Marxist." Subsequently, Chairman Mao also specially talked with Comrades Tao Zhu, Wang Renzhong, and Zhang Pinghua, instructing them to draft a decision for the Central Committee to promote this experience. Unfortunately, due to the objections of some comrades, this experience that conformed to China's national conditions and benefited the country and the people was not implemented.

Comrade Tao Zhu made many similar decisions with unique insights during his leadership of Guangdong Province and the Central-South Bureau. Soon after the national liberation, he proposed, based on the actual situation of Guangdong Province, to focus the work of the entire province on the countryside and personally took charge of water conservancy, fertilizer, seeds, agricultural machinery, and a series of specific work, proposing to build the Pearl River Delta into the country's first commercial grain base. After many years of struggle by the whole people, Guangdong Province changed from a "grain-deficient province" that needed to import grain from other provinces in the early days of liberation to being able to contribute nearly 10 billion jin of rice to the state by 1965.

During the three years of difficulty, the state had to import hundreds of millions of tons of grain from abroad every year. Tao Zhu thought of the ten-thousand-ton ships busy transporting imported grain on the sea every day, and his heart was very uneasy. He often said to us, "If our agriculture does not improve, all construction is in vain." During this period, he repeatedly told us and local cadres to be sober-minded and oppose the empty talk of transition. He said, "Now our production base is very thin, and there are only so many products. Pouring water back and forth can only spill the water and scatter people's hearts, and it has no practical significance for the transition. We want a prosperous socialism, not a poor and troubled socialism." During the period of adjusting the national economy, he approached the construction projects from the actual situation, not with a one-size-fits-all approach, but according to the needs and possibilities, retaining a batch of key enterprises. For basic industries and industries closely related to the national economy and people's livelihood, he spared no effort to support them. He organized forces from all sides to insist on doing a good job in state-owned industries and arranging the lives of workers. At the same time, he paid attention to collective enterprises and did a good job in the production of small commodities that were lacking at the time. At that time, he also paid great attention to the quality of industrial products and the economic benefits of enterprises. He organized special personnel to go to Shanghai to learn from their experience more than once. Once, he said to us with deep feelings, "The fundamental lesson of the Great Leap Forward is to insist on Chairman Mao's pragmatic style of thought, not to hear the wind and think it is rain, to rush up and down in a frenzy, and we have paid enough for this."

Working directly under Comrade Tao Zhu, we felt: he was able to make bold and wise decisions to develop agriculture mainly because of two "treasures." One is that he had a high level of Marxism-Leninism and was good at using Marxist-Leninist theories and viewpoints to analyze the situation and clarify the direction; the second is that he attached great importance to investigation and research work. When he was in charge of the Central-South Bureau and Guangdong Province, he insisted on spending more than one-third of his time each year conducting investigation and research at the grassroots level. A six-nine jeep car almost traveled through more than 100 counties in Guangdong Province. His two sets of "treasures" are the core of Mao Zedong Thought and are very worthy of our learning.

II

Comrade Tao Zhu attached great importance to ideological work, respected knowledge, and cared for intellectuals. In Guangdong, he had many high-level intellectual friends. For example, famous professors, writers, and artists such as Du Guoqing, Chen Yinke, Ding Ying, Chen Yaozhen, Mao Wenshu, Pu Zhi, and Hong Xiannü were all his close friends. He often visited them personally to seek advice and had heart-to-heart talks with these famous experts. Whether it was academic research, job arrangements, political treatment, or specific matters such as housing, transportation, and medical care for intellectuals and famous figures, he often personally followed up. During the most difficult days of economic life in the early 1960s, he personally proposed a list of 2,000 people, including high-level intellectuals and upper-class famous figures among returned overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, to be supplied with food at different levels, and asked the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee to ensure the supply. The so-called "special supply" items were limited in quantity, but they reflected the Party's care for them. Professor Chen Yinke of Sun Yat-sen University was a famous historian and literary figure. Before the liberation of Guangzhou, Hu Shi and Fu Sinian repeatedly sent telegrams urging him to go to Taiwan, which he flatly refused. Tao Zhu respected Chen's patriotism very much. When he visited Professor Chen, he saw that the old professor's house was small and books could not be placed, and there was no assistant for his writings. He immediately notified the school to solve the problem. Professor Chen Yinke had poor vision and could not read the newspaper, so Tao Zhu sent a radio, which was quite valuable at the time, to the old professor's home. Tao Zhu also instructed the Sun Yat-sen University Party Committee to say, "Professor Chen has poor vision, and I hope you can build a white path in the courtyard where Professor Chen often walks, so that he does not lose his way." This care was indeed meticulous, no wonder some old professors and experts sighed, "Those who understand me are Tao Zhu!"

Tao Zhu always attached great importance to united front work. He repeatedly said at many Party meetings: Guangdong Province has a relatively early development of capitalism, is the hometown of Sun Yat-sen, is the birthplace of democratic revolution and cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, has many democratic personages, many old friends, more than 90% of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots are from Guangdong, and most of the overseas Chinese are also from Guangdong. If the united front work in Guangdong is done well, it will have a great influence overseas. In the 1950s, he held sincere talks with non-Party famous figures at least two or three times a year to report major events of the Party and the state. He heard that the famous Kuomintang general Chen Rutan had poor living conditions, and he criticized the head of the United Front Department. Under his personal arrangement, eight non-Party figures served as deputy governors before and after the Cultural Revolution, ten served as provincial government bureau and department heads, and Guangzhou City arranged 48 non-Party figures to serve as deputy and deputy bureau heads.

Of course, Comrade Tao Zhu also made some mistakes and did some wrong things. Under the specific historical conditions at that time, there were only differences in the degree of "leftist" influence and the speed of correction. Tao Zhu belonged to the latter category. Once he discovered mistakes, as soon as the Central Committee made a clear statement, he was the fastest and most resolute to correct them, and the most courageous to take responsibility. On October 11, 1961, at the High-level Intellectuals' Symposium in the Central-South Region, Tao Zhu first publicly proposed, "We always call others 'bourgeois intellectuals.' I think we should stop here. Now they are the state's intellectuals, the nation's intellectuals, and the intellectuals of socialist construction. Therefore, I suggest that in the future, the term 'bourgeois intellectuals' should generally not be used in the Central-South Region, as this term hurts feelings. Who has what faults, speak the truth, and do not wear this hat."

During this period, we often heard Comrade Tao Zhu's serious and heartfelt self-criticism: "What is the fundamental cause of the three years of natural disasters? When problems arise, if we do not seriously and conscientiously examine the shortcomings in our leadership work, do not find the cause from the subjective side, and only push the blame to the objective side, this is absolutely not the fighting style of a Communist." Tao Zhu thought of his own "hot-headedness," calling on farmers to "eat three meals of dry food for free," and he took the lead in publicly criticizing himself within and outside the Party three or five times. At a mass rally in Chao'an County, he said, "I came here to make a self-criticism to the people of the entire county. I carried out the 'anti-concealment' campaign, making the people hungry and the cadres suffer. In the future, I will never carry out exaggeration again and will live a pragmatic life." Thinking of the "anti-rightist" campaign after the Lushan Conference, which wronged Party comrades and damaged Party democracy, he solemnly criticized himself at the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee's meeting of cadres at three levels, saying, "In the past three years, I and the Provincial Party Committee have had great shortcomings in this regard, and I am making a self-criticism to the comrades again!"

III

Tao Zhu used his whole heart to empathize with the people's suffering. In the autumn of 1959, Guangdong experienced floods, and Tao Zhu had a high fever of 40 degrees, but he insisted on directing the flood control on the Beijiang Dike in the pouring rain day and night. In 1961 and 1962, the supply of vegetables in Guangzhou, where the Central-South Bureau was located, was difficult, and Tao Zhu instructed the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee to become the "Guangzhou Vegetable Committee," and the Municipal Party Committee secretary to become the "Vegetable Committee Secretary." Comrade Yu Mingtao was then the director of the Central-South Bureau's Financial Commission, and Tao Zhu told Yu Mingtao, "Your Financial Commission is now changing to the 'Vegetable Commission.'" Tao Zhu took care of the people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and these difficulties were quickly alleviated. People said that Tao Zhu was a burning flame for the people, which was true.

Tao Zhu was so caring towards the people, but he was very strict with himself, living a simple and frugal life, and being honest and upright. Except for diplomatic occasions, he never used public funds to entertain guests. When he went out to inspect work, he had long ago "made three rules": no welcoming or sending off, no gifts, and no banquets. When he went to the grassroots level to conduct investigations, he took out his own prepared chili and preserved vegetables, and ate a big bowl of rice. During the most difficult time in Guangzhou, he ate the same ration as the citizens of Guangzhou and insisted on not eating meat. In the spring of 1963, the Foreign Trade Department made a batch of sample pastries for export to Hong Kong to earn foreign exchange. The Foreign Trade Department sent a box to each leader of the Central-South Bureau, saying it was for "tasting." Tao Zhu seriously criticized, "Please take the things back immediately, and no one is allowed to taste them for free. If you want to taste, buy it yourself, and do not do this again!" He then instructed his secretary to ask the secretaries and standing committee members of the Central-South Bureau whether they had also received this gift, and if they had, they should all return it.

In Guangzhou, Tao Zhu built land houses for more than 30,000 "water families" on both banks of the Pearl River. However, he himself lived in an old house in Guangzhou after being transferred to work there in 1951. The office repeatedly asked him to change his residence, but he said, "Production has not improved, living in such a good house and eating such good food, I feel uncomfortable, and the people will not agree." In 1965, this house was affected by an earthquake, causing the beams to tilt, and the wooden beams supporting the beams were in danger. Tao Zhu agreed to repair this old house. The repair cost exceeded the budget, and Tao Zhu handed over his entire savings of 15,000 yuan accumulated over the years to the office. Tao Zhu did not formulate a plan for the repair of the office building. During the fifteen years he led Guangdong and the Central-South Bureau, someone suggested that the Central-South Bureau build a building in the hot springs of Conghua for the leaders to use for meetings. Tao Zhu firmly rejected it and announced: "The comrades of the Central-South Bureau should come here less, and building a building is not allowed." Under the influence of Comrade Tao Zhu's personal example, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee did not build a large auditorium before Tao Zhu left Guangzhou. These had a very good demonstration effect on the comrades at that time to insist on a frugal style.

IV

Comrade Tao Zhu devoted his life to communism. From 1926, when he joined the Party at the Whampoa Military Academy, participated in the famous Nanchang Uprising and Guangzhou Uprising, whether in the underground struggle in the white areas or in the arduous struggle to establish revolutionary bases, sitting in prison, fighting on the battlefield, he was always indomitable and fearless. Especially in the special battlefield of the Cultural Revolution, he showed the lofty spirit of a Communist who is selfless and fearless.

Tao Zhu was transferred to the Central Committee, nominated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and approved by Chairman Mao. In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, when the situation was so treacherous, Tao Zhu deeply understood the difficulties of his situation after coming to Beijing, but he considered the overall situation and, upon arriving in Beijing, followed the instructions of Premier Zhou Enlai to protect a large number of responsible comrades of the Central Committee, the State Council, and some provincial and municipal Party committees within his capacity. He assisted Premier Zhou Enlai day and night to limit and reduce the impact and damage that the Cultural Revolution brought to the Party, the state, and the people. This was particularly reflected in his assistance to Premier Zhou Enlai in protecting the country's production from being disrupted. For this, he faced off against Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" in three sharp confrontations over production and counter-production.

Following the opinions of Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, Tao Zhu directly participated in drafting the "Notice on How to Carry Out the Cultural Revolution in Industrial and Transportation Enterprises and Basic Construction Units" and the subsequent "Supplementary Notice," requiring: all levels of Party committees to focus on production, and the Cultural Revolution should not be carried out in all factories and mines across the country, and even in units carrying out the Cultural Revolution, a team should be organized to focus on production and business.

The issuance of these two documents to a certain extent resisted the disruption caused by the early Cultural Revolution when Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" incited the Red Guards to attack the production lines in cities and rural areas, reducing the losses in industrial and agricultural production.

Due to the intense incitement of Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four," the Red Guards swarmed out of the school gates again, and the national production and construction faced new chaos. To prevent the spread of chaos in rural areas, Tao Zhu, following the instructions of Premier Zhou Enlai, personally wrote an editorial for the People's Daily titled "Grasp the Revolution and Promote Production." The editorial called for "definitely not missing the autumn harvest, concentrating all efforts to complete this year's autumn harvest." The editorial proposed, "School Red Guards and revolutionary students should not interfere with their work arrangements in those places." After the editorial was published, Tao Zhu, based on the spirit of the Central Office Meeting and the instructions of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai, personally presided over the drafting of the "Five Articles for the Countryside" and the "Six Articles for Factories." These two documents, in response to the serious chaos that had emerged in rural areas and industrial and transportation lines at that time, proposed that cultural revolution activities should not be carried out below the county level in rural areas, and efforts should be concentrated on completing the autumn harvest and autumn sowing to ensure the normal progress of production and construction.

Tao Zhu's resistance to the disruption of the national economy by the "Gang of Four" and the sharp confrontation that ensued made Jiang Qing so furious that she exerted political pressure on Tao Zhu and forced Premier Zhou Enlai to take a stand. Premier Zhou Enlai firmly supported Tao Zhu's work and told Jiang Qing, "If production is disrupted, will we all go and drink the northwest wind?" Encouraged by Premier Zhou Enlai's support, Tao Zhu wrote a second editorial for the People's Daily on the same day, "Urgent Appeal: Production Cannot Be Stopped." This ensured the completion of the autumn tasks in rural areas and temporarily restored relative stability to the production order in factories and mines.

Facing the then ominous situation, Tao Zhu stood tall like a proud pine tree, enduring the wind and snow on top, once again showing the revolutionary spirit of a Communist warrior. On the evening of January 4, 1967, at 9 o'clock, the rebels, under the plotting of the "Gang of Four," suddenly called out "Down with Tao Zhu" with loudspeakers outside the West Gate of Zhongnanhai. At that time, Tao Zhu was still busy with Premier Zhou Enlai dealing with state affairs. Late at night, after returning to his residence in Zhongnanhai, Zeng Zhi told him about the situation outside the West Gate, but he was completely unaware. When he was persecuted by the Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" clique with the charge of being the "biggest conservative," he proudly replied, "I take full responsibility for everything." Once, when he was pulled to a struggle session in Zhongnanhai by the rebels, several people came up, grabbed his hair, and repeatedly pushed his head down with force. His hands were tightly tied behind his back, but he stood tall and did not bow his head or bend his waist. When he returned home, his face was pale, and he roared, "I consider the overall situation, or I will fight to the death with these people!"

In the more than three years of being confined in his residence in Zhongnanhai, Tao Zhu always held his beloved "Biographies of Eminent Ministers," taking those ancient loyal and upright ministers as examples, and wrote many poems to express his heartfelt thoughts. On the occasion of his sixtieth birthday, he wrote a poem titled "A Passing Traveler," opening his heart that he had long since disregarded personal life and death, honor and disgrace, expressing his fearless attitude towards death for the Party and the people, and his firm belief in the victory of communism in China: "A passing traveler for sixty years, no need to write a poem in sorrow. The whole world bathes in the eastern wind, a thousand flowers bloom, and death is also a joy."

Comrade Tao Zhu wrote in his article "The Style of the Pine Tree": "Every person with a communist style should be like a pine tree, able to grow vigorously and work tenaciously in any adverse environment, never be intimidated by difficulties, and never yield to adverse environments. Every person with a communist style should have the lofty qualities of a pine tree, doing what the people need us to do, and for the people's interests, even if it means being crushed to pieces and leaping into the fire, it is all for the sake of the people; and with no complaints, always full of revolutionary optimism." Comrade Tao Zhu's life of brilliant revolutionary practice proves that he is like a pine tree, a person who is full of firm communist beliefs and cannot be overcome by any difficulties. Comrade Tao Zhu's life will forever be our model for learning.

    松树的风格长存
　　——深切怀念逝世20周年的陶铸同志
　　王任重　金明　雍文涛　于明涛
    今年11月30日，是我们党和国家的一位卓越领导人，久经考验的忠诚共产主义战士，无产阶级革命家陶铸同志，受到林彪、“四人帮”残酷迫害含冤去世二十周年的日子。缅怀他的一生，他那无私无畏为共产主义英勇不屈的革命情操；深入实际，多谋善断的无产阶级政治家的胆识；全心全意为人民服务的一团火精神，又栩栩如生地展现在我们面前。陶铸同志在他生前写的《松树的风格》一文中，就这样写道：“我每次看到松树，想到它那崇高的风格的时候，就联想到共产主义风格。我想，所谓共产主义风格，应该就是要求人的甚少，而给予人的却甚多的风格，所谓共产主义风格，应该是为了人民的利益和事业不畏任何牺牲的风格。”陶铸同志的这些思想，在今天新的历史时期，仍然熠熠闪光，激励后人奋进。
    一
    在陶铸同志主持中南局工作期间，他与我们朝夕相处，言传身教，是我们的好领导、好师长。我们感受最深的，首先是他善于从马克思主义、毛泽东思想的理论、观点的高度，从实际出发，处理问题，常常能够作出正确的决策。
    1960年中南局成立，那正是我国国民经济最困难的时候。中南局所辖的河南、湖北、湖南、广东、广西五省（区）灾荒严重，粮食问题普遍地沉重地压在人们的头上。把人民从饥饿中拯救出来，成为全党压倒一切的头等大事。陶铸同志此时被任命为中南局第一书记，确是受命于危难之际，双肩上的担子，是很重很重的。当时河南省的缺粮情况最为严重，震惊中央的饿死人的“信阳事件”，就发生在河南信阳地区。陶铸同志听到消息，心急如焚，立即亲自带领调查组，到信阳地区农村进行实地调查。
    信阳地区的遂平县在人民公社化和大跃进期间，曾是人为树立的全国先进典型。全国第一个成立人民公社的，是遂平县的嵖岈山公社。全国第一个放出小麦亩产7000斤“卫星”的，是嵖岈山公社。当时不少干部对此怀疑，受到打击。而在这困难时期，这里的灾荒也特别深重。遂平县的调查，更引起陶铸同志的震惊与深思。他深深感到，大跃进、反右倾之后，浮夸之风盛行，上级掌握不到真实情况，而党内党外，敢讲真话，如实反映情况的人很少了。对真实情况不甚了了，去决策，是很危险的。1961年2月12日，陶铸特别赶到郑州，在河南省委三级干部会上说，这几年主要是不顾实际情况，只凭主观愿望办事。积累与消费应有一定的比例，这两年我们就不大研究这个问题，要怎么干就怎么干。接着他以大跃进为教训，批评和检查了“一平二调”、“穷过渡”等错误做法，要省委采取措施，克服当前严重的困难。
    1961年春，毛主席在广州召开会议，讨论制订农村人民公社《六十条》，决定调整农村经济政策，并指定陶铸担任《六十条》的起草委员会主任，王任重等为副主任。陶铸为了掌握第一手材料，5月回到他的家乡——湖南省祁阳县。当天，不顾长途汽车颠簸的疲劳，深入到石门公社石峰大队的四个生产队，去看公共食堂。陶铸问社员：“吃公共食堂方便不方便？”在场的农民看到同来的省里、县里的书记，齐声答：“方便。”陶铸笑着说：“怎么？我是陶猛子哟！（陶铸小时在家乡的绰号）你们对我这个祁阳老乡，还不讲真话？”他和乡亲拉起家常：“吃公共食堂，男女老少，人这么多，有的要吃干的，有的要吃稀的，口味也不一样。再说，家里养个猪还要馊水，到底方便不方便？现今政策哪些好，哪些不好，你们怎么想的就跟我怎么讲。”农民看到陶铸这么恳切随和，你一言我一语的讲开了。有的说：“好么事呵！现今公共食堂快连清汤也喝不上了，还那来的馊水喂猪喽！”在归阳公社，陶铸看到几个过路的农民，就和他们打招呼：“你们是哪里来的呵？”一位农民说：“潘家埠的。”陶铸说：“我们是老乡呵，你认识我吗？”农民说：“没见过，不认得。”陶铸自我介绍说：“我叫陶铸，石源洞的。”农民听说是陶铸，放下挑子，和陶铸一起席地坐在路旁的土埂上，谈了起来。陶铸发现其中有些人得了浮肿病，他站起来，走到他们身旁，俯身去一个一个的抚摸着他们发肿的腿，沉重的说：“潘家埠是个好地方，搞成这个样子，是我们工作没做好啊！我对不起大家啊！”陶铸这次在祁阳倾听到农民的意见，使自己对农村分配、生产责任制、公共食堂等一系列农村经济政策怎么调整才好心里有了底，这对以后《六十条》文件的制订，起到很好的作用。
    他在祁阳家乡调查研究后，又和王任重同志到广西龙胜县作调查，了解到当地一个只有七户农民的生产组住在深山区，上下相距几十里，他们改变了生产管理上一刀切大呼隆的办法，实行了土地到户，责任到人的经营方法，积极性很高，生产连年增长。他和王任重同志就此联名向中央写了一份调查报告，提出了人民公社经营管理上，可以建立农业生产组，实行联系产量，责任到人，超产奖励的田间管理办法。毛主席赞扬这份调查报告，批示说“这个文件所作的分析是马克思主义的，分析之后所提出的意见，也是马克思主义的。”随后毛主席还专门找陶铸、王任重、张平化三位领导同志谈话，责成他们为中央起草一个推广这个经验的决定。由于有同志对此有异议，可惜这个符合中国国情的利国利民的经验，后来未能付诸推广。
      陶铸同志在先后领导广东省和中南局的工作中，类似这样作出有独到见解的决策的事例是很多的。早在全国解放不久，他就从广东省的实际情况出发，提出把全省工作重点放在农村，并为此亲自抓水利、化肥、良种、农机等一系列具体工作，提出把珠江三角洲建成为全国第一个商品粮基地。经过全体人民多年奋斗，广东省从解放初期每年需要从外省调进粮食的“缺粮省”，到1965年时能上交近10亿斤大米给国家了。
    在三年困难时期，国家每年不得不从国外进口数百万吨粮食。陶铸想到万吨大轮，天天在海上忙于运输进口粮食时，心情十分不安，常跟我们说：“我们这样一个大国，农业不上去，一切建设都是空谈。”这期间，他向我们和各地干部反复说，一定要头脑清醒，反对空谈过渡。他说，现在我们生产的底子很薄，产品只有那么多，一碗水倒来倒去，只能把水倒洒了，把人心倒散了，对过渡并没有什么实际意义。我们要富裕的社会主义，决不搞贫穷、烦恼的社会主义。在国民经济调整时期，对于基建项目，他是从实际出发，不搞“一刀切”，根据需要和可能，保留下一批骨干企业。对于基础工业和对国计民生有密切关系的工业，他千方百计地予以支持。他组织各方面力量，坚持抓好国营工业，安排好工人生活。同时注意集体企业，抓好当时欠缺的小商品生产。那时他还十分注意工业产品的质量和企业的经济效益，他不止一次地组织专人去上海取经和学习。有一次他深有感触地对我们说：“大跃进教训的根本点，就是坚持毛主席实事求是的思想作风，不能听到风，就是雨，一哄而上，一哄而下，这个亏我们吃够了。”
    我们在陶铸直接领导下工作，感到：他之所以能有胆有识的提出发展农业的正确决策，主要依靠两件“法宝”。一是他具有较高的马列主义水平，善于运用马列主义的理论、观点分析形势，明确方向；二是他非常重视调查研究工作。他主持中南局和广东省工作时，坚持每年以1／3以上的时间，到基层作调查研究，一部六九吉普车，几乎跑遍了广东省100多个县。他的这两套“法宝”，正是毛泽东思想的核心，是很值得我们学习的。

    陶铸同志十分重视意识形态工作，尊重知识，关心知识分子。在广东，他有许多高级知识分子的朋友。例如国内外的知名教授、作家、艺术家杜国庠、陈寅恪、丁颖、陈耀真、毛文书、蒲蛰龙、红线女等，都是他的至交。他经常亲自登门求教，与这些知名专家推心置腹，无所不谈。举凡知识分子、知名人士的学术研究，职务安排，政治待遇以及生活上的住房、坐车、医疗等具体事情，都不时亲自过问。在60年代初经济生活最困难的日子里，他亲自提出一个对高级知识分子和归侨、港澳同胞中上层知名人士2000人实行分级特供的名单，要广州市委保证供应。所谓“特供”的东西，数量很有限，但体现了党对他们的关怀。中山大学教授陈寅恪，是位著名的史学家和文学家。广州解放前夕，胡适和傅斯年屡次来电报催他到台湾去，被他一口回绝了。陶铸对陈老的爱国情操，十分敬重。当他去看望陈教授时，看到这位老教授住房小，书摆不下，著述没有助手，马上通知学校解决。陈寅恪教授视力差，看不了报，陶铸送了一台当时算是很名贵的收音机到老教授家去。陶铸还关照中山大学党委说，陈教授视力不好，希望你们在陈教授经常散步的院子里，专修一条白色甬道，不使他迷失方向。这关心真可谓无微不至了，怪不得一些老教授、老专家感慨地说：“知我者，陶铸也！”
    陶铸对统战工作，一向很重视。他在党内许多会议上反复讲过：广东这个省份资本主义发展较早，是孙中山的故乡，是民主革命和国共两党合作的发源地，民主人士多，老朋友多，港澳同胞90％以上是广东人，华侨的大部分也是广东人，广东的统战工作做得好，对海外影响很大。在50年代，他每年至少有两、三次同党外知名人士举行恳切座谈，向他们通报党和国家的重大事件。他听说国民党著名将领陈汝棠住房条件不好，他还批评了统战部长。在他亲自安排下，“文革”前后有八位党外人士担任了副省长，十位担任省政府正厅局长，广州市先后安排48位党外人士担任正副局长。
    当然陶铸同志也说错一些话，做过一点错事。在当时的特定历史条件下，只有“左”的影响重些、改正得慢些和“左”的影响轻一些，改正得快一些之分。陶铸属于后一种人。他一旦发现错误，中央明确表态了，他是纠正最快的最坚决的，最勇于主动承担责任的。1961年10月11日，在中南区高级知识分子座谈会上，陶铸第一次公开提出：“我们老是讲人家是资产阶级知识分子，我看要到此为止了。现在他们是国家的知识分子、民族的知识分子、社会主义建设的知识分子。因此，我建议今后在中南地区一般不要用‘资产阶级知识分子’这个名词了，这个名词伤感情。谁有什么毛病，实事求是，是什么讲什么，不要戴这个帽子。”
    这期间，我们常听到陶铸同志这样严肃的痛切的自我批评：“造成三年自然灾害的根本原因在哪里？出了问题，不严肃认真检查领导工作中的缺点，不从主观上找原因，一味推客观，这绝不是共产党人的战斗风格。”陶铸想到自己脑子发过“热”，向农民发出过“三顿干饭不要钱”的号召，他带头在党内外三番五次地进行公开的自我批评。他在潮安县群众大会上说：“我到这里来是向全县人民做检讨的。我搞‘反瞒产’，使群众饿了肚子，干部受了委屈。今后再也不能搞浮夸，要靠实事求是过日子。”想到庐山会议后“反右倾”运动，整错了党内同志，损害了党内的民主生活，又在广东省三级干部大会上郑重地自我批评说：“三年来，我和省委在这方面有很大的缺点，现在再一次向同志们做检讨！”
    三
    陶铸是用整个心去体察群众疾苦的。1959年秋广东发洪水，陶铸感冒，高烧到40度，冒着瓢泼大雨，日夜坚持在北江大堤上指挥抗洪。1961年和1962年中南局所在的广州市蔬菜供应困难，陶铸指示广州市委要变成“广州菜委”，市委书记要做“菜委书记”。于明涛同志那时是中南局财委主任，陶铸跟于明涛说，你这个财委现在就变成“菜委”罢。陶铸管群众的衣、食、住、行，管得细、管得切实，这些困难很快缓解了。人说陶铸对人民是一团火，这话符合实际。
    陶铸对群众这般关怀备至，对自己要求则十分严格，生活简朴，廉洁奉公。除了外交场合，他从不曾拿公款请过客。他外出视察工作，早就“约法三章”：不准迎送、不准送礼、不准宴请。他到基层蹲点调查，拿出自备的辣椒、腐乳，捧着大碗饭就吃了。广州供应最困难时，他与广州市民一样，只吃一份定量粮，坚持不吃肉。1963年春节，外贸部门做了一批时样点心，出口香港换外汇。外贸部门给中南局领导同志各送来一箱，名为“品尝”。陶铸严肃地批评说：“请你马上把东西收回去，谁也不许不花钱品尝。要品尝，自己花钱买，以后，不许这样干！”并随即吩咐他的秘书，问问中南局的书记们、常委们，是否也收到了这个礼品，收到了的，一律退回。
    陶铸在广州，为珠江两岸的3万多“水上人家”建起了陆地住宅。可他自己从1951年调到广州工作后，却一直住在广州一所陈旧的房子里。机关多次请他换房，他说：“生产上不去，住那么好的房子，吃那么好的饭，心里不过意，群众也不答应。”1965年这房子因地震影响，屋梁倾斜，用木料顶住的房梁出现险情，陶铸才同意对这所旧房维修。维修费超过了预算，陶铸就将他多年的全部积蓄1.5万元，上交机关。陶铸没制定过办公楼的修缮计划。他主持广东和中南局工作十五年中，有同志建议中南局在从化温泉建一幢楼，以便领导同志来此开会用。陶铸坚决拒绝，并宣布：此地中南局的同志应该少来，盖楼更不允许。在陶铸同志的以身作则的影响下，广东省委在陶铸离开广州前，一直未盖一座大礼堂。这些对当时同志们坚持艰苦朴素的作风，起了极好的示范作用。
    四
    陶铸同志为共产主义奋斗了一生。从1926年在黄埔军校入党，参加著名的南昌起义、广州起义，无论是在白区的地下艰苦斗争，还是在创建革命根据地的艰苦斗争，坐监狱，战沙场，从来坚韧不拔，英勇不屈。尤其在“文革”这场特殊的斗争战场上，更是铁骨铮铮，表现出一个共产主义者无私无畏的崇高情操。
    陶铸调中央，是邓小平同志提名，毛主席同意的。在“文革”初期那种险恶的形势下，陶铸深深了解自己来京后处境的艰难，但他顾全大局，一到北京，就遵照周总理的指示，出面保护一大批中央、国务院各部委和一些省市委负责人，在他力所能及的范围内日夜协助周总理竭力限制、减少“文革”给党给国家给人民带来的冲击和损失。这特别表现在他协助周总理保护国家的生产不受破坏这一点上。为此，他和林彪、“四人帮”面对面展开了三次冲击生产和反冲击生产的尖锐斗争。
    遵照周恩来和邓小平的意见，陶铸直接参与主持制定了《关于工业交通企业和基本建设单位如何开展文化大革命运动的通知》，以及随后制定的《补充通知》，要求：各级党委要大抓生产，“文革”不要在全国所有厂矿一哄而起，就是开展“文革”的单位，也要组织班子专职抓生产、抓业务。
    这两个文件的下达，在一定程度上抵制了“文革”初期林彪、“四人帮”煽动红卫兵对城乡生产战线上冲击带来的破坏，减少了工农业生产的损失。
    由于林彪、“四人帮”的竭力煽动，红卫兵又纷纷冲出校门，全国生产建设出现了新的混乱。为了防止农村混乱的蔓延，陶铸按照周总理的指示，亲自为《人民日报》撰写《抓革命、捉生产》的社论。社论号召“一定不要误农时，集中全力，抓好今年的秋收。”社论提出：“学校的红卫兵和革命学生，不要到那些地方去干预他们的工作部署。”社论发表后，陶铸又根据中央办公会议的精神和毛主席、周总理的指示，亲自主持写出了《农村五条》和《工厂六条》。这两个文件针对当时在农村和工交战线出现的严重混乱情况，提出农村县以下暂时不搞文化大革命，集中力量搞好秋收秋种，确保生产建设正常进行。
    陶铸抵制“四人帮”对国民经济的破坏而展开的针锋相对的斗争，使江青气急败坏，她对陶铸施加政治压力，并逼着周总理表态。周总理坚决支持陶铸的工作，对江青说：“生产搞乱了，我们都去喝西北风吗？”陶铸为周总理的支持所鼓舞，当日又为《人民日报》写了第二篇社论：“紧急呼吁：生产是不能停下来的。”保证了农村三秋任务的完成，工矿企业的生产秩序，又暂时得到了相对的稳定。
    面临当时黑云压城的形势，陶铸犹如傲然挺立的青松，任凭风雪压顶，再一次显示出共产主义战士的革命气节。1967年1月4日晚上9点钟，造反派在“四人帮”的策划下，在中南海西门外用高音喇叭突然呼叫“打倒陶铸”。此时，陶铸仍在周总理身边忙着处理国家大事。深夜12点多回到中南海住所，曾志把西门外的情况告诉他，他竟全然不知。当他被林彪、“四人帮”一伙以“中国最大的保皇派”的“罪名”迫害时，他昂然回答说：“我对我的一切负责。”有一次，他在中南海被造反派拉去批斗，几个人上来，揪住他的头发，多次使劲往下按他的头颅，他的双手被紧紧地反剪着，他就是庄严地挺着身躯，不低头不弯腰。他回到家里，脸色惨白，吼道，我顾全大局，要不就和这一帮人拚了！
    在中南海的住所被幽禁的三年多的日日夜夜里，陶铸总是捧着他心爱的那部《名臣录》，以那些古代刚正不阿的忠臣自勉，奋笔疾书，写下了大量的明心志的诗篇。在他年满花甲之际，写了题为《过客》诗一首，敞开自己早将个人生死荣辱置之度外的坦荡胸怀，表达自己为党为民死而无憾的心境，表达自己对共产主义在中国必胜的坚定信念：过客匆匆六十年，无须悲痛写诗笺。全球沐浴东风里，万紫千红死亦欢。
    陶铸同志在《松树的风格》一文中说：“每一个具有共产主义风格的人，都应该像松树一样，不管在怎样恶劣的环境下，都能茁壮地生长，顽强地工作，永不被困难吓倒，永不屈服于恶劣环境。每一个具有共产主义风格的人，都应该具有松树那样的崇高品质，人民需要我们做什么，我们就去做什么，只要是为了人民的利益，粉身碎骨，赴汤蹈火也在所不惜；而且毫无怨言，永远浑身洋溢着革命的乐观主义的精神。”陶铸同志一生的光辉革命实践，证明他就是像松树一样，是全身倾注着坚定的共产主义信念，不为任何艰难困苦所能压倒的人。陶铸同志的一生，永远是我们学习的楷模。
