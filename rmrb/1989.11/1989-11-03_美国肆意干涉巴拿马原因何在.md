Recently, the United States has escalated its economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and military threats against Panama, even going so far as to threaten to "arrest" General Manuel Noriega, the commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces.

Why does the United States arbitrarily interfere in Panama's internal affairs? A brief look at modern history and geopolitics reveals that the root cause lies in the United States' efforts to maintain its significant economic and military interests in the Panama Canal and the Canal Zone.

Panama, located at the narrowest part of the Central American isthmus, declared independence in 1903. As soon as Panama gained independence, the United States, through an unequal treaty, acquired the right to build the canal and the permanent lease of the Canal Zone for a mere $10 million and an annual rent of $250,000. In 1914, the United States completed the 82-kilometer-long canal, shortening the voyage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by over 10,000 kilometers. Since then, the United States has earned over $100 million annually from canal tolls, while the rent paid to Panama, though increased twice, was only $193,000 by 1955. The United States also established a governor's office in the Canal Zone, creating a "state within a state" that dominated Panama's fate, and repeatedly used American military police to suppress anti-American protests by the Panamanian people. In January 1964, over 30,000 Panamanians launched a patriotic storm, demanding the right to raise their national flag in the Canal Zone, resulting in 22 people being shot dead and over 500 injured by American troops.

The Panamanian people rose up in resistance, and under the leadership of the late National Guard Commander and government leader General Omar Torrijos, after repeated negotiations, finally signed a new canal treaty on September 7, 1977, which took effect on October 1, 1979. The new treaty stipulates that the management of the canal is jointly undertaken by Panama and the United States, with the Panamanian government gradually expanding its management powers, fully recovering the canal by 2000, and the complete withdrawal of American troops.

After the signing of the treaty, the United States continued to exploit Panama. In the first seven years after the treaty took effect, Panama earned $76 million to $81 million annually from the canal, which was an increase compared to the $7 million it had earned in the previous 65 years, but compared to the $280 million to $320 million the United States earned annually from the total canal income, it was only a small fraction.

According to recent revelations by Panama's former Foreign Minister and Panama Canal Commission representative, Oydén Ortega, the treaty stipulates that, except for labor, Panama mainly receives 30 cents per net ton from passing ships, an additional fixed annual payment of $1 million, and up to $1 million from the canal's surplus. Since the first two items are fixed and cannot be easily manipulated, the United States has created various pretexts in the third item to deduct Panama's income. He gave an example that in the 1981 fiscal year, the canal's income was over $300 million, which should have resulted in a significant surplus, but the United States fabricated a deficit, resulting in Panama receiving no floating annual payment.

The Panama Canal and the Canal Zone are of "great strategic significance" to the United States in controlling the two oceans, strengthening Western Hemisphere defense, and exercising hegemony worldwide. It was from the Canal Zone that the United States launched its invasion of the Dominican Republic in the early 1960s and participated in the occupation of Grenada in the early 1980s. The United States also established the School of the Americas in the Canal Zone, training 43,000 officers from Latin American countries.

During World War II, the United States established 114 military bases in the Canal Zone, using the canal to transport troops and war supplies for the war and subsequent invasions of Korea and Indochina. Today, 14 military bases remain, with Howard Air Force Base being the largest in Latin America, capable of controlling all air operations in the Western Hemisphere. Recently, the deputy chairman of the Panama Canal Commission, Manfredo, revealed that the United States signed the new canal treaty to "maintain the status quo under the guise of U.S.-Panama cooperation," with no intention of giving up its benefits. Before the new treaty took effect, the U.S. Congress passed the treaty implementation law, known as the "Murphy Amendment," "expanding the U.S. government's control over the canal and its security," placing the Panama Canal Commission under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Defense, and integrating the economic interests and military functions of the canal and the Canal Zone.

The new treaty has been in effect for just over 10 years, and there are only about 10 years left until Panama fully regains control of the canal. On January 1 next year, a Panamanian is scheduled to become the chairman of the Panama Canal Commission, with an American serving as the deputy chairman. The next 10 years are the critical period for Panama to gradually expand and eventually fully take over the management of the canal. For this reason, the United States is in a hurry to sabotage the implementation of the treaty. Since March last year, it has effectively controlled the canal unilaterally, subsequently obstructing Panama's formal representative from participating in the Panama Canal Commission meetings, and refusing to accept the Panamanian government's nominee for the chairman of the Panama Canal Commission. At the same time, it is exploiting internal conflicts in Panama to create disputes, attempting to use the chaos in Panama and the threat to canal security as a pretext to seize control of the canal by force, and even amend the canal treaty, plotting to continue occupying the canal and maintaining military bases in the Canal Zone after the year 2000.

    美国肆意干涉巴拿马原因何在
    新华社记者　胡泰然
    最近美国对巴拿马的经济制裁、外交诱逼、军事威胁轮番升级，甚至发展到扬言要将巴拿马国防军司令诺列加将军“捉拿归案”的蛮横地步。
    美国这样肆意干涉巴拿马内政，究竟用意何在？稍稍注意一下现代历史和地缘政治就不难看出，根本原因在于美国竭力维护它在巴拿马运河和运河区的重大经济和军事利益。
    地处中美洲地峡蜂腰部的巴拿马在1903年宣告独立。巴拿马刚一独立，美国就通过不平等的运河条约以一次付给1000万美元和每年仅交25万美元租金的低价，取得运河开凿权和运河区永久租让权，在1914年建成全长82公里的运河，使大西洋和太平洋之间的航程缩短1万多公里。从此美国每年从运河通行费中获得1亿多美元的巨额收入，而交给巴拿马的租金，虽然增加两次，但到1955年也只有每年193万美元。美国还在运河区设立总督府，建立主宰整个巴拿马命运的“国中之国”，多次动用美国驻运河区的军警镇压巴拿马人民的反美抗议斗争。1964年1月，3万多巴拿马群众掀起反美爱国风暴，要求进入运河区升起国旗，当场被美国军队开枪打死22人，打伤500余人。
    巴拿马人民奋起抗争，在已故国民警卫队司令、政府首脑托里霍斯将军领导下，经过反复谈判，终于在1977年9月7日签署了新的运河条约，并于1979年10月1日生效。新条约规定，运河管理由巴拿马和美国共同承担，巴拿马政府逐步扩大管理权，到2000年全部收回运河，美军全部撤走。
    签约后，美国继续巧取豪夺。条约生效头7年，巴拿马每年获得运河收入7600万到8100多万美元，这比起签约前65年间总共所得的7000多万美元固然增多，但比起美国每年从运河总收入2.8亿到3.2亿美元获取的巨额赢利，也只不过拿了个小头。
    据巴拿马前外长、运河委员会巴方代表奥伊登·奥尔特加最近揭露，按照条约规定，除劳务外，巴拿马主要是从过往船只通行费中每一净吨分成30美分，另外每年收取固定年金1000万美元，并从运河收支盈余中收取最多可达1000万美元的浮动年金。由于前两项是固定的，不好做手脚，美国便在第三项开支账上巧立名目，克扣巴拿马的收入。他举例说，1981年度运河收入3亿多美元，该有很大盈余，可是美国故造赤字，以致巴拿马的浮动年金分文未得。
    巴拿马运河和运河区对美国在军事上控制两洋、加强西半球防务乃至在全世界行使霸权，具有“重大的战略意义”。美国正是以运河区为基地，在60年代初出兵入侵多米尼加共和国，在80年代初调兵参与占领格林纳达。美国还曾在运河区设立美洲军校，为拉美各国培训了4.3万名军官。
    在第二次世界大战期间，美国在运河区曾建立了114个军事基地，利用运河为这次战争和以后的侵朝战争和印度支那战争输送兵员和战备物资。现在，这里仍保留着14个军事基地，其中霍华德基地是美国在拉美最大的空军基地，可以控制西半球的一切空中行动。运河管理委员会副主任、巴拿马人曼弗雷多最近揭露说，美国签署新运河条约，本来就是“要在美巴合作气氛下继续保持原状”，而并不打算交出所得利益。在新条约生效前夕，美国国会便通过条约执行法即《墨菲修正案》，“扩大了美国政府控制运河和运河安全的权利”，把运河管理委员会置于美国国防部的管辖之下，把运河和运河区的经济利益和军事作用结为一体。
    新条约生效刚满10周年，现在距巴拿马全部收回运河只差10年多一点。明年1月1日该由一位巴拿马人担任运河管理委员会主任，美国人改任副主任。今后10年正是巴拿马逐步扩大以至全部接收运河管理的关键时期。正因如此，美国迫不及待地破坏条约的实施，从去年3月起实际上单方面控制了运河，随后又阻碍巴拿马正式代表参加运河委员会会议，拒不接受巴拿马政府派任运河管理委员会主任的人选。同时利用巴拿马内部矛盾制造争端，企图以巴拿马局势混乱、危及运河安全为借口，武力控制运河，甚至修改运河条约，阴谋在2000年后继续霸占运河，保持运河区的军事基地。　（本报有删节）
