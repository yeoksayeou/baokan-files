Xinhua News Agency, Qinhuangdao, November 6th — (Reporter Zhou Zongmin) The third phase of the Qinhuangdao Port coal terminal, a key project in the national "Seventh Five-Year Plan," was completed and officially put into operation today after passing the inspection organized by the Ministry of Communications.

The third phase of the Qinhuangdao Port coal terminal is a supporting project for the electrified dedicated railway from Datong to Qinhuangdao. Construction began in 1984. This phase includes one 100,000-ton berth and two 350,000-ton berths, with an annual handling capacity of 30 million tons. The completion and operation of this phase have elevated Qinhuangdao Port from being China's largest energy export port to the world's largest energy export port, with an annual handling capacity of 75 million tons.

The main loading and unloading equipment for the third phase of the Qinhuangdao Port coal terminal was imported from the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States, with loading and unloading technology reaching advanced world standards.

Located in the northeastern part of Hebei Province, Qinhuangdao Port is a comprehensive port in northern China primarily for energy exports. It currently has ten berths for coal, crude oil, general cargo, and bulk grain, with a total of 25 berths, of which 13 have achieved automated operations.
