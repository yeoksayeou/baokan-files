The drought-resistant high-yield furrow technology, a dryland farming technique that has been promoted in rural Shanxi Province for over a decade, has now been extended to Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Hubei, and other regions. After eight years of promotion in Shandong Province, the total area of fields using water conservation and fertilizer accumulation tillage methods has reached one million mu.

This technology, known as the "drought-resistant high-yield furrow," was developed by Shǐ Guānyì, a senior engineer at the Shanxi Province Water and Soil Conservation Institute. Over the past decade, this technology has significantly increased grain yields, especially in years of severe drought, with each mu of farmland producing over 100 kilograms more grain than ordinary fields. In Kalgan Banner, Inner Mongolia, where annual rainfall is only around 300 millimeters, the grain supply has long been a problem. Experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences assisted in introducing the water conservation and fertilizer accumulation tillage method. This spring, while ordinary farmlands could not be sown due to drought, the "drought-resistant high-yield furrows" all produced full seedlings.

    “抗旱丰产沟”技术走出山西
    每亩可增产100公斤
    本报讯　在山西省农村推广10多年的旱地耕作技术——蓄水聚肥改土耕作法，目前已推广到内蒙古、河北、湖北等地。推广8年之久的山东省，蓄水聚肥耕作田的总面积已达百万亩。
    这个简称“抗旱丰产沟”的旱作农业技术，是山西省水保所高级工程师史观义研究的科研成果，推广10多年来，在严重干旱的年份，每亩粮田可比一般田增产100公斤以上。降雨量仅有300多毫米的内蒙古喀喇沁旗，粮食问题长期无法解决。中国科学院专家组帮助他们引进了蓄水聚肥耕作法。今春，一般农田因旱无法下种，而“抗旱丰产沟”都出了全苗。　（王荣）
