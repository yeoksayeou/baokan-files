The U.S. Federal Statistical Bureau recently released a report stating that despite six years of continuous economic growth in the United States, 12.6 million children under the age of 18 (one-fifth of the nation's children) still live below the poverty line; among black and Hispanic children, this proportion is as high as 40%. The U.S. government's official poverty line for 1988 is an annual income of less than $9,435 for a family of three.

The report suggests that the increase in single-parent households has exacerbated the poverty situation among children. According to statistics, in 1987, out of the 12.4 million children living below the poverty line, approximately 7 million lived in single-parent households. Many of these families rely solely on government aid to get by, and some cannot even afford to buy health insurance for their children. Another factor is the high unemployment rate in many cities in the central United States, where many families have lost stable sources of income.

### 美国联邦统计局的报告说　美国1／5少年生活在贫困线下

　　美国联邦统计局的报告说
　　美国1／5少年生活在贫困线下
    本报华盛顿11月22日电　记者仓立德报道：美国联邦统计局最近发表的一份报告说，尽管美国的经济6年来持续增长，仍有1260万18岁以下少年儿童（占全国同龄人1／5）生活在贫困线以下；在黑人和拉美裔少年儿童中，这个比例更高达40％。美国官方规定的1988年家庭贫困线是，3口之家年收入不足9435美元。
    这份报告认为，单亲家庭的增多加剧了少年儿童的贫困状况。据统计，1987年，在1240万处于贫困线下的少年儿童中，大约700万生活在单亲家庭中，许多家庭仅靠政府救济过活，甚至无力为孩子购买医疗保险。另一个原因是不少美国中部城市失业率高，许多家庭失去稳定的经济来源。
