China's high-power laser device recently conducted an inertial confinement fusion experiment, achieving significant results.

The device, named "Shenguang," currently has an output power of up to 20 billion kilowatts. Chinese nuclear physics, chemistry, and laser experts used this device to conduct comprehensive physical experiments on inertial confinement fusion. They successfully completed the dual-beam laser irradiation of a hollow target, achieving a sufficiently high cavity radiation temperature that surpassed the level of similar experiments conducted by foreign devices of the same type. According to the researchers, the achievement of this sufficiently high cavity radiation temperature lays a solid foundation for the next step of achieving neutron production through radiation drive.

Inertial confinement fusion, also known as laser-induced nuclear fusion, is a significant step forward for humanity in obtaining this inexhaustible new energy source.

The "Shenguang" device was built two years ago by Chinese scientists in Shanghai using entirely domestic components and materials. Over the past two years of operation, it has undergone multiple tests, with its technical performance reaching the advanced level of similar international devices.

　　我国“神光”装置了不起
　　成功进行惯性约束聚变实验
    新华社上海11月25日电  （记者张学全、通讯员吴英熙）我国一套高功率激光装置不久前进行惯性约束聚变实验，取得重大成就。
    这套名为“神光”的装置目前输出功率高达20亿千瓦。我国核物理与化学、激光专家用这套装置开展惯性约束聚变综合性物理实验时，成功地完成了双束激光对打空腔靶的试验，获得了足够高的腔内辐射温度，超过了国外同类装置同种实验的水平。据研究人员介绍，这种足够高的腔内辐射温度的获得，为实现下一步辐射驱动产生中子的目标打下了良好基础。
    惯性约束聚变，又称激光引发的核聚变。研究人员介绍说，这项实验的成功，为人类获取核聚变这种取之不尽的新能源，迈出了可喜的一步。
      “神光”装置是两年前我国科技人员依靠自己力量在上海建成的大型激光装置，元件、材料全部国产。投入运行两年来，进行了多次试验，技术性能达到国际同类装置先进水平。
