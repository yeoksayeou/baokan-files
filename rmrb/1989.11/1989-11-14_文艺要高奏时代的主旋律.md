    Literature and art should resound with the main melody of the times
    Feng Chongtai

    At present, as we look back on the past and face the present, our goal is to call for and open up the future, and to further prosper our literary and artistic endeavors on the basis of reality.

    To prosper socialist literature and art, an important point is to fully recognize and utilize the functions of literature and art, and to resound with the main melody of the times.

    Our literary and artistic endeavors are an important part of the socialist cause. In the past, under the influence of "leftist" ideology, the laws of literature and art were ignored, and the social functions of literature and art were overly exaggerated, turning them into empty, detached tools of propaganda, which severely constrained and injured the productive forces of literature and art. The lessons from this period are profound. However, in a recent period, the views that literature and art are non-ideological, non-rational, non-realistic, and non-historical, which emphasize the aesthetic and entertainment functions of literature and art, and advocate for literature and art to be left to run wild, are also wrong. Not long ago, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that one of our major mistakes in the past was that we did not pay enough attention to education. The education mentioned here is not just basic education, but more importantly, social and cultural education and ideological and political education. Recently, we have emphasized the "two hands" approach, which means one hand to grasp economic construction and the development of socialist commodity economy, and the other hand to grasp the construction of spiritual civilization and work in the ideological and political domain. The construction of spiritual civilization and work in the ideological and political domain also includes literary and artistic endeavors. Because cultural construction is an important part of the construction of spiritual civilization and an important part of ideology. In a past period, we neglected work in the ideological and political domain and the construction of spiritual civilization, and there were also problems with our recognition and utilization of the functions of literature and art, especially their educational and cognitive functions.

    Over the past decade, reform has achieved remarkable success, bringing profound changes to social life and people's thoughts, lifestyles, and ways of thinking. However, with the transition from old to new systems, the adjustment of social structures, the changes in interests, and the conflicts in values, various social contradictions have become complex, causing fluctuations and imbalances in people's thoughts and emotions. In the process of developing a commodity economy and opening up, ideological and political work and the construction of spiritual civilization have been relaxed, and with the emergence of some social problems, people's confidence and emotions have been directly affected, increasing the difficulty of work. Facing reality, our literature and art should provide more healthy and beneficial products to the people, to improve their quality, enlighten their wisdom, influence their reason and emotions, help them establish noble moral sentiments, and beautify their lives. We should especially pay attention to the role of literature and art in inspiring and encouraging the whole nation, and resound with the main melody of the times.

    What is the main melody? All works that adhere to the four cardinal principles, are beneficial to the four modernizations and comprehensive reform, and inspire people to strive for progress, innovate, and pursue excellence, and cultivate people's moral sentiments, can constitute the main melody of our times. Currently, the situation in our cultural market is that street culture is thriving, and vulgar, negative, and even reactionary and obscene things are widespread. In serious literature and art, there is a lack of works that are majestic, inspiring, and rich in both literary and artistic qualities. A nation should have strong cohesion; a nation that does not allow for a hundred schools of thought and a hundred flowers blooming has no hope. But a nation without a strong spiritual pillar, without a common ideal and pursuit, is even more hopeless. As socialist literature and art, we should have a direction to advocate and guide, and it has the responsibility to reflect and express the main melody of the times. Advocating the main melody, is this advocating that literature and art simply correspond to reality? Will it lead to the singularity of creative themes? Marx once said, every drop of dew under the sun's rays shines with endless colors, let alone such a rich social life! Our view has always been that all literary and artistic works that are beneficial to the physical and mental health of the people, bring aesthetic enjoyment to people, and under the premise of prioritizing social benefits, provide people with rest and entertainment, belong to socialist literature and art. But the current situation is: the voice of the main melody is too weak! In fact, all truly influential works in the history of literature and art, without exception, stand at the height of history and the times, have profound and vast characteristics, reflect the mainstream and essence of that era, express the wishes and demands of the people, that is, the main melody. Literature and art should pay attention to the times, beat with the pulse of the times, and resound with the main melody, which should also be multi-faceted and multi-level. We need works that stand at the height of history and have strong artistic appeal, as well as photography, painting, calligraphy, drama, singing and dancing performances, concerts, and other forms of mass cultural activities. To a certain extent, this is the advantage of our local cultural departments, and we should make great efforts to organize and carry out these activities, so that socialist ideology can occupy various ideological and cultural fronts, and make due contributions to the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.

    For literature and art to resound with the main melody of the times, we must properly handle the relationship between adhering to the "two serves" direction and adhering to the "hundred flowers and schools of thought" policy. Socialist literature and art is the unity of political direction and the diversity of content, form, and style. Serving the people and serving socialism is the fundamental purpose and direction of our literary and artistic work, the soul of the "hundred flowers and schools of thought" policy, and must be firmly implemented; the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is the fundamental way to implement the "two serves" direction, and must also be firmly implemented. Without the "two serves," the "hundred flowers and schools of thought" will lose direction; without the "hundred flowers and schools of thought," the "two serves" cannot be realized. The two are interdependent and inseparable, and are both basic policies of the Party in the field of literature and art. Looking at them in our work, many problems in literary and artistic theory and practice can only be solved through contention, and fair conclusions can be drawn. Excellent writers and works can also only emerge through the "hundred flowers and schools of thought" and be recognized by everyone. Therefore, we should encourage, protect, and promote various literary and artistic theories, schools, creative methods, artistic styles, exploration, innovation, contention, and fusion; on the other hand, we must make it clear that choosing the socialist road is the correct choice made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China after experiencing countless setbacks and struggles, and "only socialism can save China" is the conclusion drawn by the Chinese people through long-term struggle and practice. Therefore, serving the people and serving socialism are consistent, and deviating from the "two serves" direction is also against the fundamental interests of the Chinese people. In this sense, letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend can only be the hundred flowers blooming and a hundred schools of thought contending under the "two serves" direction, otherwise, truth, goodness, and beauty will be confused with falsity, evil, and ugliness, and ugly and even reactionary and backward things will take the opportunity to spread.

    To ensure the development and prosperity of works that express the main melody of the times, we should, when dealing with serious literature and art and popular literature and art, start from the needs of the people and from reality, and support and protect those serious literature and art works that have high ideological and artistic value, represent the direction of literary and artistic development, and have little market value but are exploratory in nature. We should also enthusiastically support healthy popular literature and art, and allow the existence of those popular literature and art works that are harmless and popular among the people, and actively guide and improve them. Only in this way can popular literature and art and serious literature and art develop in harmony and meet the multi-level needs of the people. And our literary and artistic workers, no matter what kind of works they create, should not lower their standards, and should not take harmlessness as their standard and pursuit, but should strive to achieve the organic unity of ideological value, artistic value, and market value, and provide the people with literary and artistic products that are to their taste and healthy and beneficial, while remembering their social responsibility, guiding the people's spiritual consumption, and helping them improve their aesthetic level.

    文艺要高奏时代的主旋律
    冯崇泰
    当前，我们回顾过去，正视现在，其目的是为了呼唤与开拓未来，在现实的基础上实现我们的文艺事业的进一步繁荣。
    繁荣社会主义文艺，重要的一点，是充分认识和发挥文艺的功能，高奏时代的主旋律。
    我们的文艺事业是社会主义事业的一个重要组成部分。过去在“左”的思想影响下，文艺自身的规律被忽视了，文艺的社会功能被过分夸大了，成了脱离实际的空洞说教的工具，严重地束缚和挫伤了文艺生产力，这方面教训是十分深刻的。然而，一个时期以来盛行的所谓文艺的非意识形态化、非理性化、非现实社会化和非历史化的观点，片面强调文艺的审美功能、娱乐功能，认为文艺只是供人玩赏而让其放任自流的观点，也是十分错误的。不久前邓小平同志指出，我们前些年的一个重大失误，就是教育抓得不够。这里所说的教育，不仅仅指基础教育，更多的是指社会文化教育、思想政治教育。我们最近强调的“两手抓”，即一手抓经济建设、抓发展社会主义商品经济，一手抓精神文明建设，抓思想政治领域的工作。精神文明建设、思想政治领域的工作，也包括了文艺事业。因为，文化建设是精神文明建设的重要组成部分，是意识形态的重要组成部分。在过去的一段时间里，我们对思想政治领域的工作、精神文明建设有所忽视，其中也有对文艺的功能特别是教育功能、认识功能认识不够、发挥不够的问题。
    过去的10年，改革取得了世界瞩目的成就，给社会生活以及人们的思想观念、生活方式和思维方式带来深刻变化。但是，随着新旧体制的转换、社会结构的调整、利益关系的变化、价值观念的冲突，各种社会矛盾错综复杂，造成人们思想心态和情绪上的动荡与失衡。而在发展商品经济和改革开放过程中，放松了思想政治工作和精神文明建设，加之一些社会问题的出现，直接影响着人们的信心和情绪，增加了工作的难度。面对现实，我们的文艺，要更多地将健康有益的产品提供给人民大众，以提高人们的素质，启迪人们的智慧，影响人们的理智和感情，帮助人们树立高尚的道德情操，美化人们的生活。要特别重视发挥文艺对全民族的鼓舞、激励的作用，高奏时代的主旋律。
    什么是主旋律？凡是坚持四项基本原则，有利于四化建设和全面改革，有利于激励人们奋发图强、开拓创新、积极进取和陶冶人们道德情操的优秀之作，都可以构成我们这个时代的主旋律。目前，我们的文化市场上的情况是，地摊文化发达，一些庸俗消极甚至反动淫秽的东西流传甚广。而严肃文艺中，又恰恰缺少气势磅礴、激励人心、文情并茂的作品。一个民族应该有强大的凝聚力，不允许百家争鸣、百花齐放的民族是没有希望的民族；但没有强大的精神支柱，没有共同的理想、共同的追求的民族，更是没有希望的。作为社会主义文艺，我们对文艺的方向应该有所提倡有所引导，它有责任反映和表现时代的主旋律。提倡主旋律，这是不是主张文艺与现实生活的简单对应？会不会导致创作题材的单一化呢？马克思早就说过，每滴露水在太阳的照耀下，都闪耀着无穷无尽的色彩，何况是如此丰富的社会生活！我们的观点历来是，一切有益于人民身心健康，能给人们带来美感享受、在社会效益第一的前提下能给人们提供休息娱乐的文艺作品，都属于社会主义文艺。但目前的情况是：主旋律的声音太不响亮！事实上，一切真正在文艺史上有深远影响的作品，无不是站在历史与时代的高度，具有深邃博大的特征，无不是反映了那个时代的主流和本质，表达了人民的愿望和要求，也就是主旋律。文艺关注时代，随时代脉搏跳动，奏主旋律，也应该是多方面、多层次的。我们需要那种站在历史高度具有强大艺术感染力的大作力作，也需要摄影、绘画、书法、戏剧、歌咏会、演唱会等多种形式的群众文化活动，一定程度上说这是我们地方文化部门的优势，要下大力气组织开展，让社会主义思想占领各种思想文化阵地，为社会主义精神文明建设作出应有的贡献。
    文艺要高奏时代的主旋律，就要摆好坚持“二为”方向和坚持“双百”方针的关系。社会主义文艺，是政治方向一致性与内容形式、风格流派多样性的统一。为人民服务，为社会主义服务，是我们文艺工作的根本宗旨和根本方向，是“双百”方针的灵魂，必须坚定不移地贯彻；文艺创作的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，则是贯彻“二为”方向的根本途径，也必须坚定不移地贯彻。离开了“二为”，“双百”就失去了方向；离开了“双百”，“二为”就实现不了。二者是互相依存、不可分割的整体，都是党在文艺方面的基本政策。把它们放在我们的工作中看，文艺理论与实践中的许多问题，只有在争鸣之中才能解开疙瘩，得出公正的结论。优秀的作家和作品，也只有通过“双百”，才能破土而出，被大家所认识。所以，我们要鼓励、保护各种文艺理论、流派和创作方法、艺术风格的探索、创新、争鸣和交融；另一方面，我们必须明确，走社会主义道路是中国人民在中国共产党领导下经历了无数挫折和斗争之后作出的正确选择，“只有社会主义才能救中国”是全中国人民在长期斗争实践中得出的结论。因此，为人民服务与为社会主义服务是一致的，背离了“二为”方向，也就违背了全国人民的根本利益。从这个意义上讲，百花齐放、百家争鸣，只能是坚持“二为”方向的百花齐放、百家争鸣，否则真、善、美与假、恶、丑就会混淆不清，丑恶的甚至反动落后的东西就会趁隙泛滥。
    为了保证表现时代主旋律的作品的发展与繁荣，对待严肃文艺和通俗文艺，我们应从人民群众的需要出发，从实际生活出发，对那些市场价值不大却有很高思想价值、艺术价值、代表了文艺发展方向的严肃文艺，包括探索性的创作，予以扶持和保护，对健康的通俗文艺，也要热情支持，对那些有益无害、群众喜闻乐见的通俗文艺，也要允许其存在，并加以积极的指导和提高。只有这样，通俗文艺、严肃文艺才能协调发展，满足人民群众的多层次需要。而我们文艺工作者，无论创作什么作品，都不能降格以求，不应把无害作为自己的标准和追求目标，而要尽可能追求思想价值、艺术价值、市场价值的有机统一，既要向人民群众提供合乎口味、健康有益的文艺产品，又要牢记社会责任，引导群众的精神消费，帮助他们提高审美层次。
