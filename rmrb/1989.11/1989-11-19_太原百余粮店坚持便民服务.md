Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, November 18th — (Reporter Dù Wénfēng) In the streets and alleys of Taiyuan City, it is common to see grain shop workers pedaling tricycles to deliver grain to residents' doorsteps. This is an activity that the "Learn from Lei Feng Groups" in Taiyuan's grain shops have persisted with for nearly ten years.

Taiyuan City Grain and Oil Supply Company currently has 160 grain shops. Since 1980, over 130 "Learn from Lei Feng Groups" have been established, and various public service activities have been consistently carried out. The Heitu Alley Grain Shop has opened evening grain sales from 8 PM to 9 PM, and also provides services such as reserving bags and oil bottles for grain and oil purchases. The grain shops in the Houyingfang area have set up "Priority Windows for Soldiers to Buy Grain."

    太原百余粮店坚持便民服务
    据新华社太原11月18日电　（记者杜文峰）在太原市的一些大街小巷，经常可见粮店工人蹬着三轮车上门给居民送粮。这是太原市粮店“学雷锋小组”坚持了近十年的一项活动。
    太原市粮油供应公司现有160个粮店，从1980年至今，已建立了130多个“学雷锋小组”，并坚持开展各项为民服务活动。太原黑土巷粮店开设了晚8点至9点的晚间售粮业务，同时还开设了预约留面袋、油瓶售粮油等服务项目。后营坊地区各粮店开设了“军人购粮优先窗口”。
