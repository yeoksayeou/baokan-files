To produce more grain, it is necessary to expand the area of cultivated land. There are two ways to do this: one is to reclaim land and directly expand the area of cultivated land; the other is to improve the quality of existing land, indirectly expanding the area of cultivated land. Reclaiming land often faces constraints from resource conditions and human factors, and has its limits. Improving the quality of existing land, making each unit of land produce more grain, can be achieved with effort.

In our county, Dongxinzhuang Town's Wanggezhuang Village has a total of 4,000 mu of land. The village party branch led the villagers to develop 2,000 mu of "high-yield farmland." The main approach was to improve soil quality, enrich soil fertility, convert dry land to irrigated land, and practice multiple cropping of vegetables and grains. The average income per mu exceeded 1,000 yuan, while the remaining land in the village had an average income of only 600 yuan per mu. The "high-yield farmland" is equivalent to adding 1,300 mu of land to Wanggezhuang Village. By this logic, our county has a total of 870,000 mu of cultivated land, with about 270,000 mu of low-yield fields where the average grain yield per mu is below 250 kilograms. In 1988, the county's average yield was 885 jin per mu. If we strive to improve land quality and make the 270,000 mu of low-yield fields reach the level of medium- and high-yield fields in the county, we can increase grain production by 50 million kilograms, indirectly adding more than 100,000 mu of cultivated land. This is a very significant figure.

The calculations are very optimistic, but improving land quality is not easy. In recent years, a worrying phenomenon has emerged in rural areas: farmers have neglected land quality improvement, and many have cultivated "sanitary fields," leading to a significant decline in soil fertility. According to our county's agricultural department, the average amount of farmyard manure applied per mu was 4,100 kilograms in 1983, but this had dropped to 2,000 kilograms by 1987. Why has this situation arisen? First, agricultural production costs are high, labor-intensive, and the income from farming is much lower compared to wages from working or doing business. Farmers say: at most, one mu of land can produce an additional 150 kilograms of corn, and even at a high price, it is not worth 100 yuan, but if the land is farmed carelessly and the remaining time is used for business, even collecting scrap metal can earn 200 to 300 yuan per month. Second, since the implementation of the household responsibility system in rural areas, it has been difficult to organize large-scale agricultural infrastructure projects. Our county has about 150,000 to 160,000 mu of hilly and sandy land that is severely water-deficient. In the 1960s and 1970s, four reservoirs were built in these areas, turning poor land into fertile fields with yields of 300 to 400 kilograms per mu. Now, it is very difficult to organize such reservoir construction projects. Additionally, our land contract period is not stable enough, and improving land quality is not something that can be achieved overnight. People are afraid of losing out, and dare not invest wholeheartedly in land quality improvement.

    下功夫提高土地质量
    中共河北遵化县委书记　苏根群　遵化县代县长　范全
    要多打粮食，必须扩大耕地面积。扩大耕地面积有两条途径：一是开荒造地，直接扩大耕地面积；二是提高现有土地质量，间接扩大耕地面积。开荒造地，往往要受到资源条件和人为因素的制约，有一定的限度。提高现有土地质量，使单位面积的土地打出更多的粮食，只要下功夫，就有文章可做。
    我们县东新庄镇王各庄村共有土地4000亩，党支部带领群众搞起了2000亩“高效益农田”，主要做法是提高土质，培肥地力，变旱地为水浇地，蔬菜与粮食作物多茬轮作，亩均收入1000元以上，而该村的其余土地亩均收入只有600多元；“高效益农田”等于使王各庄村“增加”了1300多亩土地。按此推论，我县共有耕地87万亩，粮食平均亩产在250公斤以下的低产田约占27万亩。1988年全县平均单产885斤，假使我县大力提高土地质量，使27万亩低产田都达到全县中高产田水平，就可增加粮食5000万公斤，间接增加耕地10万多亩，这是一个十分了不起的数字。
    帐算起来很乐观，提高土地质量的工作做起来可不容易。近几年来，农村出现了一个令人焦虑的现象：农民忽视土地质量建设，种“卫生田”的人不少，导致地力严重下降。据我县农业部门反映：全县平均亩施农家肥1983年4100公斤，到1987年下降到2000公斤。为什么会出现这种情况呢？首先是因为农业生产成本高，耗工费力，与务工经商的收入相比差之甚远。农民反映：一亩地充其量多打150公斤玉米，卖高价不足100元，可是如果把地随便一种，余下的时间用来做买卖，就是收破烂每月也挣二三百元。其次是农村实行责任制以后，大型的农田基本建设项目很难再搞起来。我县有十五六万亩丘陵和沙地，严重缺水，六七十年代在这些地方修了4座水库，使薄地变成良田，亩产三四百公斤。现在想再修这样的水库就很难组织人马了。再者：我们的土地承包期不够稳定，加强土地质量建设又不是一朝一夕的事情，群众怕吃亏，不敢放心大胆地在土地质量建设上下功夫。
