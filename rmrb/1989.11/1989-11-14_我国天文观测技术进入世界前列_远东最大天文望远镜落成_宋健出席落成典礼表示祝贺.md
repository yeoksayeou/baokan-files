China has another major scientific achievement—the 2.16-meter astronomical reflecting telescope project—following the completion of the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider. The completion ceremony was held today at the Xinglong Observation Station of the Beijing Astronomical Observatory.

This is the largest astronomical telescope in the Far East by diameter. On behalf of the State Council, Song Jian, a member of the State Council and the Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, expressed his gratitude and greetings to the scientists and engineers who designed, manufactured, installed, and debugged this highly precise device. Zhang Jinfu, a member of the Central Advisory Commission, Liu Zhongde, Vice Secretary-General of the State Council, renowned scientist Qian Sanqiang, and more than 200 astronomers and representatives from relevant sectors attending the sixth enlarged meeting of the Chinese Astronomical Society were present at the ceremony. The U.S. Ambassador's Science and Technology Counselor and his wife also attended the ceremony.

This large-scale basic scientific observation facility was designed, manufactured, and installed successfully by more than ten domestic research and production units. It includes optical, mechanical, driving, automatic control, and stellar detection devices. The telescope is equipped with an advanced CCD camera, which is 30 times more sensitive than ordinary photographic film. The detected stellar images can not only be displayed on the screen but also converted into data stored on disks for various analyses and processing by computers. Its completion signifies that China's astronomical optical observation capabilities have reached an advanced international level.

    我国天文观测技术进入世界前列
    远东最大天文望远镜落成
    宋健出席落成典礼表示祝贺
    本报承德11月13日电　记者蒋建科报道：继北京正负电子对撞机工程之后，我国又一项重大科技成果——直径为2.16米的天文反射望远镜工程今天在北京天文台兴隆观测站举行落成典礼。
    这是远东直径最大的天文望远镜。国务委员、国家科委主任宋健代表国务院向广大研制、安装、调试这台高度精密装置的科技和工程人员表示感谢和慰问。中顾委常委张劲夫、国务院副秘书长刘忠德、著名科学家钱三强和出席中国天文学会第六届理事会扩大会议的天文学家及各有关方面代表200多人出席了今天的典礼。美国大使馆科技参赞偕夫人一同参加典礼。
    这是由国内10多家科研、生产单位自行设计、研制、安装成功的一项大型基础科学观测实验设施，它包括光学、机械、驱动、自控、星光探测装置等。望远镜装备有先进的CCD照相机，比普通照相底片灵敏30倍，探测到的星像除可在屏幕显示外，还可转换为数据储存在磁盘上，用计算机进行各种分析和处理。它的落成表明我国天文光学观测能力达到国际先进水平。
