Editor's Note:

Everyone Expose Fake and Substandard Goods

Fake and substandard goods are hated by consumers, and the government is continually cracking down on them. But why can't they be completely eradicated? From the three letters published here tracking down fake and substandard goods, the problem lies with the producers and sellers.

Goods are related to everyone. The performance and quality of a product are best known by the broad masses of consumers. As manufacturers of goods, companies should seek benefits through quality and development through reputation, investing more high-quality products into the market to promote production, enriching and beautifying people's lives; as direct sellers of goods to consumers, they should think about what consumers need, sell good and genuine products, and win consumers' trust with fair prices and quality service. Many companies and shops (including individual operators) are doing just that, thus earning a good reputation and achieving good economic and social benefits.

However, it must be noted that among the dazzling array of goods, there are many that are counterfeit or substandard. Those who produce and sell fake and substandard goods for the sake of profit, blatantly advertise "high quality and low price" in the market to deceive consumers; some local leaders and supervisory departments often turn a blind eye to the production and sale of fake and substandard goods in their regions, using the excuse of developing the local economy or simply pursuing profits. As a result, fake and substandard goods continue to flood the market, and consumers' interests are continually harmed.

The resolute ban on fake and substandard goods has become the call of the broad masses. The methods to achieve this rely on everyone. As consumers, once fake and substandard goods are discovered, they should be immediately reported and complained about, leaving no room for them to exist. The departments of industry and commerce, metrology, and quality inspection should work closely together. As long as fake and substandard goods are found in the market, they should follow the trail to find the producers and sellers. For those who specialize in manufacturing and selling fake and substandard goods, in addition to severe economic penalties, those who commit crimes should be severely punished according to law; for those departments and officials who openly condone, support, and shelter illegal activities, and even collude in crimes and benefit from them, they should be seriously dealt with. Relevant national departments should also introduce some knowledge to the public on how to identify fake and substandard goods. Employees of factories and shops that produce and sell fake and substandard goods have the responsibility to expose the inner workings. If everyone from top to bottom and inside out gets involved, fake and substandard goods will surely be reduced and even eliminated from the market.

### 大家来揭露伪劣商品

    大家来揭露伪劣商品
    伪劣商品，消费者皆恨之，政府也在不断查处。但为什么总禁不住？从这里发表的三封对伪劣商品追踪的来信看，问题出在生产者和经销者身上。
    商品与人人有关。一种商品的性能如何、质量怎样，广大消费者最有发言权。作为生产商品的厂家，应该以质量求效益，以信誉求发展，把更多更好的优质产品投放市场，促进生产的发展，美化和丰富人们的生活；作为直接和消费者见面的商品的经营者，则应该想消费者之所想，卖好货，卖真货，并以公道的价格、优质的服务取得消费者的信赖。许多厂家、店家（包括个体经营者），正是这样做的，因而赢得了美名，取得了很好的经济效益和社会效益。
    但也要看到，在琳琅满目、五光十色的商品中，鱼目混珠、滥竽充数者为数不少。那些以捞钱为目的的人，明明制造、销售的是假货、劣货，还要在市场上大叫“质优价廉”，让消费者上当受骗；一些地方的领导及主管部门，也往往以发展地方经济或单纯追求效益为由，对本地区产销的伪劣商品睁一只眼，闭一只眼。这一来，伪劣商品不断泛滥，消费者的利益不断受损。
    坚决查禁伪劣商品，已成为广大群众的呼声。查禁的办法，要靠大家。作为消费者，一旦发现伪劣商品，应该立即举报、投诉，使其无立足之地。工商、计量、质检等部门密切配合，只要从市场上发现伪劣商品，即可顺藤摸瓜，查出生产者、经营者。对那些专门从事制造、销售伪劣商品的不法分子，除了给以严厉的经济制裁以外，构成犯罪的要依法予以严惩；对于那些公然纵容、支持、庇护违法活动，甚至合伙作案，从中得益的部门和干部，要严肃处理。国家有关部门还应向群众介绍一些识别伪劣商品的知识。生产、经销伪劣商品的厂家、店家的职工，有责任揭露其中的内幕。如果上上下下、里里外外都动起来，必然会减少以至杜绝伪劣商品上市。
