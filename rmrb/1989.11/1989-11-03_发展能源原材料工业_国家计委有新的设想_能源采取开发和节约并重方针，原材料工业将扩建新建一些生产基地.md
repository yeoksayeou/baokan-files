According to a recent disclosure by a responsible person from the State Planning Commission, the "bottleneck" sectors of energy and raw materials industries, which have been constraining national economic development, will see relatively rapid growth in the 1990s. The State Planning Commission has recently proposed preliminary plans for the future development and construction of energy and raw materials.

It is reported that China's energy development will adopt a strategy of balancing exploitation and conservation. In the 1990s, the state will build a number of large and medium-sized hydropower stations and thermal power stations, as well as several nuclear power plants. Hydropower projects will primarily focus on constructing key hydropower stations in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and the Red Water River. Thermal power projects will mainly involve building large thermal power plants along the coast and along the railways that transport coal. The expansion of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant and the Guangdong Nuclear Power Plant will continue, and several more nuclear power plants will be built in coastal areas with economic development but energy shortages. Meanwhile, efforts will be made to strengthen the development of coal bases in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia, with a focus on building large coal mines in Shengmu, Dongsheng, Zhunge'er, and Pingluo. Exploration and development of oil will be intensified, aiming to find more reserves in the Bohai Bay, Tarim, and offshore oil fields. Additionally, the state will promote energy conservation through equipment upgrades, combined heat and power generation, coal-electricity joint ventures, and the utilization of low-quality coal and other energy sources to improve the high energy consumption per unit of GDP.

In the next decade, the raw materials industry will expand and build several production bases. The steel industry will primarily focus on the renovation and expansion of existing enterprises, upgrading equipment, increasing production capacity, and diversifying product types. Non-ferrous metals will prioritize the development of aluminum, lead, and zinc, which have resource advantages. In addition to expanding existing aluminum plants and lead-zinc bases, new bases will be built. The chemical industry will, in conjunction with resource development, build a number of large-scale phosphate fertilizer plants and petrochemical plants.

    发展能源原材料工业
    国家计委有新的设想
    能源采取开发和节约并重方针，原材料工业将扩建新建一些生产基地
    新华社北京11月2日电  （记者吴士深）据国家计委负责人近日透露，制约国民经济发展的“瓶颈”部门——能源、原材料工业，在90年代将有较快的发展，国家计委日前提出了未来能源、原材料开发和建设的初步设想。
    据介绍，我国能源的发展将采取开发和节约并重的战略方针。在90年代，国家将建设一批大中型水电站和火电站，以及若干座核电站。水电项目主要是在黄河上游、长江中上游、红水河等新建一批骨干水电站。火电项目主要是在沿海地区和运煤铁路沿线建设大型火力发电站。继续扩建秦山核电站和广东核电站，并在沿海经济发达的缺能地区，再建设若干座核电站。同时，加强山西、陕西、内蒙古煤炭基地的开发，重点建设神木、东胜、准格尔、平朔等大型煤矿。加强石油的勘探和开发，争取在渤海湾、塔里木和海上油田的勘探方面找到更多的储量。此外，国家还将通过更新设备、热电联产、煤电联营等措施，大力节约能源和加强劣质煤等能源的利用，以使单位国民生产总值能耗过高的情况有所改善。
    原材料工业在今后10年内将扩建和新建一些生产基地。钢铁工业主要进行现有企业的改造和扩建，更新现有设备，扩大生产能力，增加产品品种。有色金属将优先发展具有资源优势的铝、铅、锌等，除扩建现有的铝厂、铅锌基地外，再建设新的基地。化学工业要结合资源的开发，建设一批大型的磷肥厂和石油化工厂。
