In the imported cosmetics section of Beijing's Longfu Department Store, 60 different types of imported perfumes are displayed. Not only cosmetics, but also watches, glasses, electronic keyboards, food, beverages, toys, and various household appliances can be found in abundance in the stores of major cities. Recently, some industry associations under the Ministry of Light Industry held a meeting and jointly appealed for strict controls on the import of consumer goods.

According to incomplete statistics, in 1988, $27 million was spent on importing cosmetics. In the first five months of this year, nearly $10 million was spent on imports. In major cities, the sales revenue from imported cosmetics accounts for 20% to 30% of the total cosmetics sales revenue. In the first five months of this year, $14 million was spent on importing beverages. The annual import of glasses exceeds 8 million pairs, with 40% of the market in large cities and 20% to 30% in medium and small cities being occupied by imported glasses. During the significant decline in the domestic electronic keyboard market, more than ten brands of electronic keyboards continued to be imported. In 1988, a total of $85 million was spent on importing refrigerators, washing machines, and vacuum cleaners; in the first five months of this year, 200,000 refrigerators were imported, costing $37 million. In 1988, $1 billion was spent on importing children's toys, and in the first five months of this year, $30 million was spent on imports.

In stark contrast, China has over 800 cosmetics production plants. Shanghai Household Chemical Factory alone produces over 200 types of cosmetics, covering high, medium, and low-end products, with quality not inferior to foreign products. There is no reason to blindly pursue foreign goods. China's watch and clock production ranks fourth in the world, and has formed a production capacity that adapts to the domestic market. However, under the impact of imported assembled watches, 25 medium-sized watch factories and 17 component factories have reduced or stopped production, resulting in the idling of nearly $500 million in fixed assets and a significant reduction in state tax revenue. The import of household appliances has caused the already saturated home appliance market to be severely backlogged.

The cosmetics, watches, glasses, home appliances, and musical instrument industries under the Ministry of Light Industry have successively proposed that the irrational import of consumer goods must be rectified. If foreign goods continue to be imported in large quantities, the market will be severely impacted, which will undoubtedly deal a fatal blow to China's consumer goods industry.

    国内市场疲软　盲目进口不当
    轻工部门吁请限制消费品进口
    许多国产品质量并不差，没有理由追求洋货
    本报北京11月18日讯　记者刘桂莲报道：在北京隆福大厦进口化妆品专柜上，摆放的进口香水多达60种。不仅化妆品，手表、眼镜、电子琴、食品、饮料、玩具及各式家电产品，在各大城市的商店里比比皆是。轻工部部分行业协会日前在一个座谈会上联合呼吁：严格控制消费品进口。
    据不完全统计，1988年，化妆品进口用去外汇2700万美元；今年1至5月进口用汇又近千万美元。各大城市的大百货商店，进口化妆品的营业额，占化妆品营业额的20％至30％。今年1至5月，进口饮料用汇达1400多万美元。进口眼镜每年高达800万副以上，大城市的40％、中小城市的20％至30％的市场被进口眼镜占领。在国内电子琴市场大滑坡的时候，有十几个牌号的电子琴仍源源不断进口。电冰箱、洗衣机、吸尘器1988年进口总计花去外汇8500万美元；今年1至5月又进口电冰箱20万台，用汇3700多万美元。儿童玩具，1988年用掉外汇1亿多美元，今年1至5月又进口用汇3000多万美元。
    和上述情况形成鲜明对照的是，我国现有化妆品生产厂达800余家，仅上海家用化学品厂生产的化妆品就达200多种，高中低档次齐全，质量决不比外国的差，没有理由盲目追求洋货。我国手表、钟的产量均居世界第四位，已形成适应国内市场的生产能力。可是，在进口组装钟表的冲击下，25个中等规模的手表厂和17个元配件厂减产、停产，近5亿元固定资产的能力放空，并使国家减少大量税收。家用电器的进口，则造成本来就饱和的家电市场严重积压。
    轻工部化妆品、钟表、眼镜、家电、乐器等行业相继提出，消费品的盲目进口，到了非整顿不可的时候了，如再大量进口洋货，冲击市场，必将给我国消费品工业以致命的打击。
