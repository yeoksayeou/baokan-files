The Federal Presidency held an expanded meeting in Belgrade on November 8 to discuss and adopt a resolution on the ethnic relations in Yugoslavia. The full text of the resolution was broadcast by the Yugoslav News Agency on November 17.

The resolution points out that it is necessary to resolutely halt the further deterioration of inter-ethnic and inter-republic relations, and at the same time, create the necessary social atmosphere for constructive dialogue and the elimination of mistrust and intolerance.

The resolution stresses that the leaders of the federation, republics, and autonomous provinces should stop mutual attacks.

The resolution calls on the leaders of the republics and autonomous provinces to meet directly as soon as possible to discuss contentious issues, and to strive to eliminate misunderstandings and conflicts among them on the basis of mutual respect.

The resolution points out that the "media war" has recently reached the point of directly exacerbating inter-ethnic and inter-republic relations. The resolution calls for an end to the "media war" and for those who abuse "press freedom" to incite ethnic hatred to be held accountable.

In the resolution, the Federal Presidency emphasizes that the main efforts should be focused on solving the most important issues of stabilizing the economic and political situation, creating conditions for effective economic and political reforms, and overcoming the economic and political crisis.
