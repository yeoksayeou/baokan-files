The European Single Market, scheduled to be established in 1992, presents both opportunities and challenges for the economically powerful Federal Republic of Germany. Overall, however, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

The significance of the Single Market for the Federal Republic of Germany is immense. Chancellor Kohl believes its importance is comparable to the currency reform of 1948. Most economists agree that the opportunities provided by the Single Market far outweigh the risks.

A survey conducted by the Munich Economic Research Institute last year revealed that 64% of enterprises clearly support the Single Market, 26% believe that opportunities and risks are equal, and only 7% feel that risks outweigh opportunities.

The Federal Republic of Germany has much to gain.

Firstly, it believes the Single Market will facilitate its economic expansion. The European Community is crucial to the economic interests of the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1988, 54% of Germany's imports and 52% of its exports were within the Community. The Federal Republic of Germany has accumulated a trade surplus of over 300 billion marks with its partner countries over the years, but various visible and invisible barriers cost Germany 100 to 150 billion marks annually. According to Krupp Company, after the establishment of the Single Market, Germany's mechanical engineering industry alone could create 200,000 jobs and increase annual revenue by 40 billion marks.

Secondly, it believes the Single Market will strengthen cooperation with Community partners and enhance competition with the U.S. and Japan. In 1988, only 54.8% of Germany's high-tech exports to the U.S. matched its imports of the same category, and only 32.9% of its high-tech exports to Japan matched its imports. The largest patent market in the world remains in the U.S., with Japan's share significantly increasing, while the shares of the U.K. and France are decreasing. Germany's share is barely maintained. Since Germany primarily collaborates with Western European countries in basic research and new technology adoption, only by engaging in higher-level, larger-scale cooperation with Community partners can it better compete with the U.S. and Japan.

The opportunities presented by the Single Market have prompted various sectors in Germany to take swift action.

The Kohl government voluntarily agreed to contribute an additional 32.5 billion marks to the Community from 1988 to 1992 as "poverty alleviation" funds to secure the support of Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece for the Single Market.

The German government is accelerating reforms in fiscal and tax policies, healthcare, postal services, and pension systems to adapt to the future Single Market.

The business sector is also seeking new cooperation opportunities with partner countries. Mercedes-Benz plans to collaborate with relevant automobile companies in the U.K., France, and Italy to merge the current 30 major automobile companies in the Community into 21. Siemens has decided to cooperate with Philips on a $2 billion investment project to strengthen chip production.

However, there are also concerns within the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the Single Market.

Due to high currency value, high taxes, and high enterprise welfare expenditures, as well as the fact that the transportation industry cannot compete with the Netherlands and the insurance industry is less reputable than the U.K., Germany faces severe challenges in labor and capital.

Due to differing attitudes towards the European Monetary System, seen as the "Mark bloc," the Mark may be suppressed.

Due to shorter working hours and higher labor costs, the competitiveness of German products is unlikely to see significant improvement.

    统一大市场与联邦德国
    何拄峰
    将于1992年建立的欧洲统一大市场，对于经济实力雄厚的联邦德国来说是有喜也有忧，但总的来看，还是喜多于忧。
    大市场对联邦德国意义重大。科尔总理认为，其重要性可与1948年的货币改革相比。大部分经济界人士认为，大市场提供的机会多于风险。
    慕尼黑经济研究所去年的一项调查表明，64％的企业明确支持大市场，26％的企业认为机会与风险相等，只有7％的企业觉得风险大于机会。
    联邦德国喜出有因。
    首先，它认为大市场有利于其扩张经济。共同体对于联邦德国的经济利益至关重要。1988年，联邦德国进口的54％，出口的52％是在共同体内部进行。联邦德国对伙伴国的历年贸易顺差累计达3000多亿马克，但各种有形、无形的壁垒使联邦德国每年损失高达1000—1500亿马克。据克虏伯公司估计，大市场建立后，仅联邦德国机械制造业即可增加20万个就业岗位，营业额年增400亿马克。
    其次，它认为大市场有利于加强同共同体伙伴之间的合作与美、日竞争。1988年联邦德国向美国输出的高技术产品只占从美进口同类产品的54.8％，向日本出口的高技术产品甚至只占从日本进口同类产品的32.9％。目前世界最大的专利市场仍在美国，日本所占比例明显上升，英、法比例下降，联邦德国勉强维持原状。由于联邦德国在基础研究和新技术采用方面主要同西欧国家合作，因此，只有与共同体伙伴开展更高层次、更大规模的联合，才有可能同美、日更好地较量。
    大市场带来的机会使联邦德国各界迅速行动起来。
    科尔政府自愿从1988—1992年向共同体多缴325亿马克作为“扶贫”资金，以换取意大利、西班牙、葡萄牙和希腊对大市场的支持。
    联邦德国政府正在加速财政税收、卫生、邮电和养老金制度的改革，以便适应将来的大市场。
    企业界也在寻求同伙伴国家的新的合作机会。奔驰公司计划与英、法、意有关汽车公司共同倡议，把共同体目前30家大汽车公司合并成21家。西门子公司决定与飞利浦公司进行一项投资20亿美元的合作项目，加强芯片生产。
    然而，联邦德国对大市场喜中亦有忧。
    由于币值高、税收高、企业福利支出高，加之交通运输业难敌荷兰，保险业不及英国信誉高，联邦德国主要在劳务、资金方面面临严峻挑战。
    由于对被视为“马克集团”的欧洲货币体系态度各异，马克有可能受到抑制。
    由于联邦德国工人劳动时间短，劳动成本高，其产品的竞争能力难有大的提高。
