World Badminton Cup Enters Second Day, Chinese Mixed Doubles and Women's Doubles Young Players Perform Outstandingly

    The World Badminton Cup entered its second day today. China's mixed doubles, a traditionally weak category, showed significant improvement. Jiang Guoliang and Nong Qunhua, playing together, defeated Denmark's Jan Knudsen and N. Nielsen with a score of 2-0. In today's men's singles matches, Indonesia's Lius Pongoh, who lost yesterday, narrowly avoided defeat after a grueling 1.5-hour battle against Malaysia's Rahmat Sidik. Chinese players Zhao Jianhua, Xiong Guobao, and Yang Yang all won their matches, while the men's doubles pair Chen Kang and Chen Hongrou suffered a loss.

    China's women's doubles players Sun Xiaqing and Zhou Lei, who lost yesterday, did not lose heart. Today, they confidently faced Denmark's Dorte Kjaer and N. Nielsen. The two young Chinese players worked in perfect harmony, with one focusing on the baseline and the other on the net. They used a combination of smashes, drops, and net shots to quickly win the first set. In the second set, they again took the initiative, leading comfortably with a score of 15-4, securing a beautiful victory.

    South Korean men and women players also performed well today. Indonesian young star Ardyanto once again stole the show, using his swift and aggressive style to quickly defeat Britain's S. Butler.

    世界杯羽毛球赛进入第二天
    我混双女双小将表现出色
    本报广州11月16日电　记者黄振中报道：我国羽毛球的弱项混双今天有可喜进步，蒋国良和农群华配对，以2∶0战胜丹麦的简·克努森和内·尼尔森。在今天的世界杯羽毛球赛的男单角逐中，昨天败阵的印尼名将罗天宁又险些翻船，经过1个半小时的苦战才勉强胜了马来西亚的拉·西德克。中国的赵剑华、熊国宝、杨阳等选手都获胜，只有男双选手陈康和陈红勇吃了败仗。
    中国女双选手孙小青和周雷昨天败阵后不气馁，今天充满信心地迎战丹麦的多·克耶尔和内·尼尔森。我两员小将配合默契，打得顺手，一个打底线，一个吊网前，时而劈杀，时而打吊，很快胜了第一局。第二局一开始又占主动，比分遥遥领先，以15∶4打了一个漂亮胜仗。
    南朝鲜男女选手今天也大都过关。印尼小将阿迪又出尽风头，以快速凌厉的攻势很快就击败英国选手史·巴特勒。
