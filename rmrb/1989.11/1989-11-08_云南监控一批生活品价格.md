To strive to achieve this year's price control target, Yunnan Province, in addition to requiring each locality to improve the price control target responsibility system, will, starting this month, monitor the prices of 73 items and 7 types of charges that are applicable throughout the province. These 73 items are all closely related to people's lives, such as rice, oil, meat, sugar, cloth, exercise books, and urea; the 7 types of charges are rent, tap water, electricity for lighting, tuition fees, haircuts, bathing, and urban bus fares. The provincial government emphasizes that the prices of these items and charges, except for those specially approved by the State Council, are not to be raised this year, and the prices of some items will be appropriately reduced through measures.

    云南监控一批生活品价格
    本报昆明十一月六日电  记者钱江报道：为了努力实现今年物价控制目标，云南省除要求各地完善物价控制目标责任制外，从本月起对全省性的七十三种商品和七种收费实行价格监控。这七十三种商品都与人民的生活密切相关，如大米、油、肉、糖、布、作业本和尿素等；七种收费是房租、自来水、照明电、学杂费、理发、洗澡、市内公共汽车票。省府强调，这些商品和收费的价格，今年内除国务院特批的以外，一律不得涨价，其中部分商品的价格还要采取措施使之适当回落。
