The second-largest coal transshipment port in the country—Nanjing Pukou Port—is facing a severe situation where a large amount of coal for power plants is accumulating, causing congestion at the port and station. The port and station frequently issue urgent alerts.

Since September, the coal wharf at Pukou Port has seen a monthly increase in the arrival of coal for power plants. Due to the inability to transport it in a timely manner, the coal wharf has transformed from a transshipment station into a storage yard. Coal piles have reached a height of 9 meters, exceeding the 6-meter limit. Even a 4-meter-wide road has become a coal pile. A 2,500-ton coal pile has been smoldering for a week. The Pukou Railway Station, adjacent to the coal wharf, is also severely congested with coal cars. Every day, dozens, or even over 200, coal cars cannot be unloaded due to the lack of space. The severe accumulation of coal for power plants at Pukou Port Station has affected the continued supply of coal from mines and railways.

The causes of the severe accumulation of coal for power plants at Pukou Port Station and similar places are multifaceted. The primary issues include the limited storage capacity and weak loading and unloading capabilities of power plants; non-planned coal occupying the allocated coal space; due to ships being delayed at the plant, the turnover time for coal ships has increased, reducing transport capacity. As a result, Pukou Port sees a continuous arrival of coal cars, but very few ships to transport the coal. Additionally, the planned coal transport prices are significantly lower than the cooperative coal prices, affecting the enthusiasm of the shipping sector. The proportion of coal varieties arriving is also imbalanced, with a large accumulation of coal for power plants, while high-quality coal and white coal remain in short supply.

To address the issue of the large accumulation of coal for power plants, grassroots units appeal for: in addition to exerting the maximum effort to unload, transport, and store more coal, they also hope that decision-making bodies will strengthen production scheduling, promote balanced transportation of coal, and that local governments will promptly formulate measures to clear the port and station, fundamentally ensuring the smooth operation of ports and stations.

### 电煤严重积压浦口港站告急　呼吁：加强煤炭均衡运输

　　电煤严重积压浦口港站告急
　　呼吁：加强煤炭均衡运输
    全国第二大煤炭中转港——南京浦口港，面临大量电煤积压、堵港压车的困境，港站频频告急。
    浦口港煤码头自9月份以来，电煤到达量月月上升，由于不能及时转运，使煤码头由中转站变成了贮煤场，煤堆高达9米，超过6米高的限度。4米宽的道路也成了煤堆，一个2500吨的煤堆正在冒出缕缕白烟，已经自燃一个星期了。与煤码头紧靠的浦口火车站煤车积压同样严重，每天都有几十辆甚至200多辆车皮因没有货位而无法卸车。浦口港站电煤严重积压状况，影响了煤矿、铁路继续来煤。
    造成浦口港站等地电煤严重积压的原因是多方面的，主要是电厂存煤、装卸能力弱；计划外煤炭挤占统配煤地盘；由于厂前压船，运煤船队周转时间长，运力下降，在浦口出现到达煤车滚滚而来，接运煤船寥寥无几的现象，而计划煤炭运价大大低于协作煤，也影响了航运部门的积极性；到达煤炭的品种比例失调，在电煤大量积压的情况下，精煤和白煤仍然紧缺。
    为解决电煤大量积压的问题，基层单位呼吁：除了尽最大力量多卸、多转、多贮外，还希望决策机构加强生产调度工作，加强煤炭均衡运输，地方政府抓紧制订疏港、疏站措施，从根本上确保港口车站的畅通。刘士安　薛贵宝
