National Labor Model Worker and Party Branch Secretary of Xiaoyangguantun Village, Wanglaoxiang, Qiping County, Shandong Province, Zhang Guozhong, sat on the stage of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, participating in the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The powerful words of Comrade Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, made him even more excited. His eyes welled up with tears, and tears kept welling up in his eyes. He struggled to hold back, not letting the tears fall. "This is truly beyond my wildest dreams! A beggar boy could have such a day!"

Indeed. Zhang Guozhong is 64 years old this year. At the age of 3, he lived with his maternal grandmother, and at the age of 7, he went begging with a stick. At the age of 22, he joined the Communist Party of China. In his more than 40 years as a village cadre, he has left a series of solid footprints...

Starting from the winter of 1961, Zhang Guozhong led the people of Xiaoyangguantun Village to use the 23 cows and 4 carts that the team had at the time to transport the collapsed house soil and wall soil from the village to the fields to fill the pits; he also organized the people to dig ditches and started agricultural infrastructure construction. By 1964, Xiaoyangguantun Village began to sell grain to the state, ranking first in the Liaocheng area, and this continued until 1978.

The spring breeze of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party blew across the land of western Shandong. On the night of the tenth day of the Chinese New Year in 1980, the office of the Party Branch of Xiaoyangguantun Village was brightly lit. Here, the Party Branch Committee had been discussing for five consecutive nights the issue of whether cadres should serve the people after the land was contracted.

Originally, after the implementation of the responsibility system, the village cadres, like the people, also contracted land. Going out to attend meetings and handle affairs would delay their own farming, and some thought that being a cadre was a disadvantage. Some people also felt: "The land is in the hands of the households, and the Party Branch is not needed." Facing this problem, Zhang Guozhong led the committee members to study and discuss, unifying their thoughts. They expressed their determination to remember the Party's purpose and wholeheartedly serve the people for their benefit. To truly serve the people, in the new situation, they had to lead the people to get rich together.

Zhang Guozhong carefully analyzed the actual situation of Xiaoyangguantun, visited elderly farmers household by household, discussed with village cadres repeatedly, and visited higher-level departments and the Provincial Agricultural Academy many times for advice, conducting extensive and in-depth discussions and demonstrations. They realized that having a lot of land and a good agricultural foundation was the biggest advantage of Xiaoyangguantun Village. If they abandoned these advantages to work or do business, it would be like "earning a board outside and losing a door at home."

Under his guidance, the Party Branch determined the guiding ideology of "scientific and technological development and agricultural prosperity," and decided to lead the people to farm scientifically and create "golden children" in the 1,400 mu of land.

Starting from 1985, Zhang Guozhong led the people to boldly reform and implement three-dimensional planting.

After a few years of practice, Xiaoyangguantun Village finally found a new path to prosperity through planting. In Zhang Guozhong's words, it is "focusing on a small area to make money, focusing on a large area to produce grain and cotton, adding money (interplanting vegetables) in the grain and cotton fields, changing once to increase production, changing spring cotton to summer cotton, investing income from small fields into large fields, increasing production of grain, cotton, vegetables, and melons, developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and commerce, this is called the virtuous cycle of planting industry."

Implementing three-dimensional planting, there are many problems that individual households cannot solve. Zhang Guozhong thought of what the people thought of and did everything he could to solve the difficulties in production. In recent years, he led the Party Branch and Village Committee cadres to strengthen collective service functions, implementing a full set of services including "oil, fertilizer, medicine, film, seed, sales, purchase, introduction (introducing technology and talent), prevention (epidemic prevention), and unified," so that the things the people urgently need can be obtained without leaving the village. Zhang Guozhong, in order to introduce good seeds and technology, despite his old age and weak body, traveled south and north, east and west many times.

The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Anyang Cotton Research Institute, and more than ten research institutions and colleges and universities all have his footprints and "scientific and technological friends." Since 1986, the per capita income of Xiaoyangguantun Village has increased by 500 yuan each year, and this year the per capita income will reach 3,000 yuan. Their contributions to the state are also increasing. For wheat alone, this village of less than 400 people sold 85,000 jin last year and 116,000 jin this year, exceeding the state procurement quota. In April 1988, experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences came here for an on-site investigation and praised Xiaoyangguantun as "a new model for the development of the plains in China." In July 1989, when Jiang Chunyun, Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, visited Xiaoyangguantun, he gave a high evaluation, calling it "a bright pearl in northwestern Shandong." Indeed, this brilliant pearl, under the carving of Zhang Guozhong, shines with even more inspiring light.

Zhang Guozhong has been a cadre for more than 40 years, managing a "million-dollar estate," but he never took an extra grain from the collective, nor did he spend an extra penny from the collective. When he goes out to attend meetings, although he is entitled to a living allowance, he always pays for it himself. When he goes out to do things for the village, he never stays in a high-class hotel, saving a few yuan where he can. A few years ago, when the trend of eating and drinking was prevalent in society, he and the village cadres never used public funds to have a meal or drink. For the village's red and white events, dividing land, and during the New Year and Spring Festival, he never went to the people's homes for banquets. This time, the 1,000 yuan awarded to him at the National Labor Model Workers Conference, he handed over to the collective in full.

    闪光的脚印
    ——记茌平县小杨官屯村党支部书记张国忠
    柳成轩
    全国劳动模范、山东省茌平县王老乡小杨官屯村党支部书记张国忠，坐到北京人民大会堂主席台上，参加庆祝中华人民共和国成立四十周年大会。
    中共中央总书记江泽民同志铿锵有力的话语更使他激动不已。他的眼眶湿润了，泪珠老是在眼里打转转。他竭力忍着，不使泪珠掉下来。“真是梦想不到的事！一个要饭娃能有今天！”
    是的。张国忠今年64岁。他3岁住姥娘家，7岁拉着棍子要饭，22岁加入中国共产党。在当村干部40多年的历程中，他踏下了一串坚实的脚印……
    从1961年冬天起，张国忠率领小杨官屯村群众用当时队里仅有的23头牛、4辆花轱轮车，将村里倒塌的房土、墙土运到地里垫坑；又组织群众挖沟，搞起了农田基本建设。到1964年，小杨官屯村开始向国家交售粮食在聊城地区占第一，一直保持到1978年。
    党的十一届三中全会的春风吹遍了鲁西大地。1980年大年初十夜，小杨官屯村党支部办公室灯火通明。在这里，围绕土地承包后干部要不要为群众服务的问题，支委会已经连续开了5个晚上。
    原来，实行生产责任制后，村干部同群众一样也承包了土地，外出开会、办事，要耽误自己种地，有的认为当干部吃亏。部分群众也觉得：“土地到了户，用不着党支部”。针对这个问题，张国忠带领支委们学习讨论，统一思想。他们表示要牢记党的宗旨，全心全意为人民谋利益。要想真正为人民服务，在新的形势下，就得带领群众共同致富。
    张国忠仔细分析了小杨官屯的实际，逐户找老农座谈，再三同村干部商量，多次到上级部门和省农科院请教，进行了广泛深入的探讨、论证，认识到土地多，农业基础好，是小杨官屯村最大的优势。如果丢开这些优势去务工经商，就等于“外挣一块板，家舍一扇门”。
    在他的引导下、党支部确定了“科技开发，务农致富”的指导思想，决心带领群众科学种田，在1400亩土地里创出“金娃娃”。
    从1985年开始，张国忠带领群众大胆改革，实行立体种植。
    经过几年的实践，小杨官屯村终于走出了一条靠种植业致富的新路子。用张国忠的话说，就是“少数面积狠抓钱，多数面积搞粮棉，粮棉地里再加钱（间套瓜菜），一次改多收，春棉改夏棉，小田收入投大田，粮棉瓜菜都增产，农林牧商都发展，这就叫种植业的良性大循环。”
    实行立体种植，有许多一家一户难以解决的问题。张国忠想群众所想，千方百计为发展生产排忧解难。近几年来，他带领党支部、村委会的干部们，加强了集体服务功能，实行了“油、肥、药、膜、种、销、购、引（引进技术、人才）防（防疫）、统”的全套服务，使群众急需的东西不用出村就可拿到手。张国忠为引进良种、引进技术，不顾年老体弱，多次南下北上、东去西往。
    中国农科院、山东农科院、安阳棉科所等十几家科研单位、大专院校都留下了他的足迹，都有他的“科技朋友”。1986年以来，小杨官屯村人均收入每年增加500元，今年人均收入将达到3000元。他们对国家的贡献也越来越大，仅小麦一项，这个不足400人的小村，去年交售8.5万斤，今年交售11.6万斤，超额完成国家征购任务。1988年4月，中国科学院的专家来这里实地考察后，称赞小杨官屯是“我国平原开发的新模式”。1989年7月，山东省委书记姜春云到小杨官屯考察时给予高度评价，称之为“鲁西北的一颗明珠”。是啊，这颗璀璨的明珠在张国忠的雕琢下，愈加放射出振奋人心的光辉。
    张国忠当干部40多年，掌管着“万贯家业”，但从不多占集体一粒粮，从不乱花集体一分钱。他外出开会，虽然规定有生活补贴，但他总是自掏腰包，外出为村里办事，从没住高级旅馆，能省几块就省几块。前几年社会上吃喝风盛行，但他和村干部没用公款吃过一顿饭，喝过一次酒。村里的红白事，划宅基地，逢年过节，他从不到群众家里吃请。这次，全国劳模会上奖励他的1000元钱，他如数上交给集体。
