Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 4th.

The Indian coffee industry is on the brink of collapse due to the sustained decline in international coffee prices.

Reports indicate that the price of coffee on the international market has dropped to its lowest point in nearly a decade this year: 60 cents per pound. It is estimated that this low price is likely to remain unchanged in the coming years.

This is a significant blow to India, which produces 3% of the world's coffee and accounts for 1.5% of the world's total exports.

Furthermore, the Indian coffee industry is facing rising costs and increasing debt.

    印度咖啡工业面临危机
    新华社新德里11月4日电  据此间报纸今天报道，由于国际市场咖啡价格持续下跌，印度咖啡工业濒临崩溃。
    报道说，今年国际市场的咖啡价格首次下降到近十年来的最低点：每磅60美分。据估计，这一低价很可能在近几年内不会上浮。
    这对于咖啡产量占世界3％、占世界总出口量1.5％的印度来说，显然是很大打击。
    此外，印度咖啡工业还有成本上升，债务加重之虞。
