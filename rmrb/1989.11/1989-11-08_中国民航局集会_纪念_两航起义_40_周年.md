Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 7th. (Reporter Li Mei) The China Civil Aviation Administration held a grand gathering today to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the "Two Airlines Uprising." The former youthful heroes, now with white hair, reminisced about the passage of time while feeling joyous about the glorious achievements of China's civil aviation over the past 40 years.

On November 9, 1949, over 2,500 employees of China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation in Hong Kong bravely declared their uprising, flying 12 aircraft northward to return to the newly established People's Republic of China. This patriotic and just act shocked both China and the world. From then until now, China's civil aviation has grown from a few dozen old, small transport planes, 12 routes, and an annual passenger load of 10,000 to possessing over 170 aircraft of various international models, 350 domestic and international routes, and an annual passenger load of 14.42 million. By the end of last year, China's civil aviation's annual transport turnover volume had ranked 14th in the world. The development of China's civil aviation is inseparable from the efforts of the "Two Airlines Uprising" personnel. As the backbone of China's civil aviation, they are active in various positions such as air transport, aircraft maintenance, airport construction, and scientific research and education. They have also trained batch after batch of air and ground service technical personnel for China's civil aviation.

State Councilor Zhou Jiahuai highly praised the "Two Airlines Uprising" personnel for their unwavering adherence to socialist patriotism. He hopes that the "Two Airlines Uprising" personnel can pass on these good traditions, good thoughts, and good styles to the younger generation, so that China's civil aviation industry can prosper even more.

    中国民航局集会
    纪念“两航起义”40周年
    新华社北京11月7日电  （记者李玫）中国民航局今天隆重集会，纪念“两航起义”40周年。昔日的风华少年，如今已白发苍苍，两航起义人员在唏嘘岁月流逝的同时，不禁为新中国民航40年的辉煌感到欢欣。
    1949年11月9日，中国航空公司和中央航空公司的2500多名香港员工毅然宣布起义，驾驶12架飞机北上，回归刚刚新生的中华人民共和国。他们这一爱国、正义的壮举，震惊了中外。从那时到现在，新中国民航从十几架老式小型运输机、12条航线、年载客1万人发展成为拥有170多架国际各种机型飞机、350条国际国内航线、年运送旅客1442万人的实力。去年底中国民航年运输总周转量已排名世界第14位。中国民航的发展同两航起义员工的努力分不开。作为新中国民航的骨干力量，他们活跃在航空运输、机务维护、机场建设、科研教学等各个岗位。他们还为新中国民航培养出一批又一批的空地勤业务技术人才。
    国务委员邹家华在会上高度赞扬两航起义人员始终如一地坚持社会主义的爱国主义精神。他希望两航起义人员能把这些好传统、好思想、好作风传给年轻一代，使中国民航事业更加蒸蒸日上。
