Wang Jiaxiang was an outstanding leader who made significant contributions to our Party and the army. His contributions were multifaceted.

His contributions to the Zunyi Conference are something I experienced directly. During the Long March, facing the enormous losses suffered by the Red Army, Comrade Wang Jiaxiang was deeply concerned and clearly proposed to change the erroneous leadership of Bo Gu and Li De, advocating that Comrade Mao Zedong should take charge. He shared this idea with me, and I fully agreed, as I had the same thoughts. Under the historical conditions at that time, he dared to propose this and to advocate for it within the leadership, which was no small matter. It required a fearless revolutionary spirit to do so. At the Zunyi Conference, he also openly criticized the erroneous commands of Bo Gu and Li De, fully supporting Comrade Mao Zedong's correct proposals. The Zunyi Conference saved the Party and the Red Army at a critical moment in the Chinese revolution, becoming a pivotal conference in the Party's history. Comrade Wang Jiaxiang's contributions at the Zunyi Conference were outstanding, and we should not forget them. Comrade Mao Zedong once said, "At the Zunyi Conference, Wang Jiaxiang cast the decisive vote."

In April 1931, Comrade Wang Jiaxiang arrived at the Central Revolutionary Base and served as the Vice Chairman of the Central Revolutionary Military Commission and the Director of the General Political Department. I arrived at the Central Revolutionary Base at the end of that year and became the Deputy Director of the General Political Department the following January. Two months later, I was transferred to the First Red Army Corps to serve as the Political Commissar for over five years. Comrade Wang Jiaxiang devoted a lot of effort to the political work of the Red Army and made many achievements, which I experienced directly. At that time, many regulations, systems, and institutions of the Red Army's political work were established and improved under his leadership. At the First National Political Work Conference of the Red Army in February 1934, Comrade Wang Jiaxiang, along with Comrades Zhou Enlai and Zhu De, summarized the practical experiences of Red Army construction and proposed the famous thesis that "political work is the lifeline of the Red Army," which has had a profound guiding significance for the construction of our army.

From the Zunyi Conference to the Seventh Congress, Comrade Wang Jiaxiang was a core member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission led by Comrade Mao Zedong, participating in the decision-making on many major issues. He contributed to the victory of the Long March of the Red Army, the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and also made important contributions to the maturity of the entire Party and the relatively complete formation of Mao Zedong Thought.

The publication of the "Selected Works of Wang Jiaxiang" is of great significance for Party and military cadres, especially the younger generation, to study Party history, military history, and Mao Zedong Thought. It is also of great significance for inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions of our Party and army in the new period of socialist modernization construction in our country, strengthening Party building, spiritual civilization construction, and ideological and political work, adhering to the Party's basic line of "one center, two basic points," and striving to do a good job in various aspects.

    写在《王稼祥选集》出版之际
    聂荣臻
    王稼祥同志在我们党和军队的历史上，是一位作出了重大贡献的卓越领导人。他的贡献是多方面的。
    他对遵义会议的贡献，我是有直接感受的。在长征途中，面对红军蒙受的巨大损失，稼祥同志深为忧虑，明确提出要改变博古、李德的错误领导，应该让毛泽东同志出来领导。他把这个意见同我说了，我说我完全赞成，我也有这个想法。在当时的历史条件下，他敢于提出、并在领导层中酝酿这件事，是很不简单的，是要冒政治风险的，如果没有大无畏的革命精神就很难做到。在遵义会议上，他又旗帜鲜明地批评博古、李德的错误指挥，全力支持毛泽东同志的正确主张。遵义会议在中国革命的危急关头挽救了党、挽救了红军，成为党的历史上一次关键性的会议。稼祥同志在遵义会议上的贡献是突出的，我们不能忘记。毛泽东同志说过，遵义会议王稼祥投了“关键的一票”。
    稼祥同志1931年4月到中央革命根据地后，担任中央革命军事委员会副主席、总政治部主任。我是在这一年的年底到达中央革命根据地的，翌年1月担任总政治部副主任，两个月后即被调到红一军团担任政治委员达5年多时间。稼祥同志对红军政治工作建设，花了很多心血，有很多建树，我也是有直接感受的。那个时候，红军政治工作的很多条例、制度和机构，是在他主持下建立和健全起来的。在1934年2月红军第一次全国政治工作会议上，稼祥同志和恩来、朱德同志一起，总结了红军建设的实践经验，提出了“政治工作是红军的生命线”的著名论断，这对我们军队的建设具有深远的指导意义。
    从遵义会议到七大前，稼祥同志是以毛泽东同志为首的中共中央和中央军委核心领导成员之一，参与对许多重大问题的决策。他为红军长征的胜利、为抗日战争的胜利作出了贡献，同时也为全党的成熟、为毛泽东思想比较完整地形成起来作出了重要贡献。
    《王稼祥选集》的出版，对于我们党和军队的干部、尤其是青年一代研究党史、军史，研究毛泽东思想，是很有意义的，对于在我国社会主义现代化建设的新时期继承和发扬我党我军的优良传统，大力加强党的建设、精神文明建设和思想政治工作，坚持党的“一个中心，两个基本点”的基本路线，努力做好各方面的工作，都是很有意义的。
