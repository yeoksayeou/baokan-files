**Editor's Note:** “The needs of the motherland are my aspirations! To the places where the motherland needs me the most!” For the broad masses of intellectuals in the 1950s and 1960s, this was not only a proud slogan but also a guiding principle for action. Today, many young people find these slogans unfamiliar and even incomprehensible. We publish this article, "A Man's Pride in This Place," to report on the moving deeds of meteorological engineer Zhou Rujian, who, in response to the needs of meteorological development, moved from Guangzhou to Mohe and rooted himself there for 27 years of hard work. We hope that this will inspire many young friends to think about the value of life.

Zhou Rujian was born in the suburbs of Guangzhou but has been fighting in the northwestern part of Heilongjiang for 33 years. He loves his children but does not move them to the bustling cities of the south, instead letting them settle in the northern frontier. Despite suffering from multiple illnesses, his superiors have repeatedly asked him to rest, but he thinks of the batch after batch of young people who come to the "edge of the world" and need to be nurtured and cared for, so he continues to work overtime on his post. Although he has not achieved remarkable achievements, he is praised as "our North Star."

**Northward, Northward**

In the summer of 1956, Zhou Rujian was notified to go to Hailongmen, a thousand miles north of Harbin, to build a meteorological station. For Zhou Rujian, who had just transferred from the Changchun military to the Harbin Meteorological Bureau, continuing northward was another test. Although this 22-year-old, who had joined the army five years earlier (at the age of 17) without telling his family, had already adapted to the cold climate of the north and the diet of sorghum and corn, how to arrange his 7-year-old younger brother, whom he had just taken in after the death of his parents, became a problem. "The call of the organization is my guide to action." Zhou Rujian did not waver and immediately entrusted his younger brother to a colleague, resolutely setting out and beginning a life of living in dilapidated forts, using kerosene lamps, eating wild vegetables, and boiling potato soup.

In January 1960, he was again transferred to the Red Border Farm, 300 miles east of Hailongmen, to establish a meteorological station, and he persuaded his wife and younger brother to join him. There were no brick houses, no "dry rammed earth" houses, and the houses were made of willow branches and mud. From the outside, you could see the inside. In winter, you had to wear cotton hats to sleep; in the morning, the quilt was covered with a thick layer of frost...

The national meteorological cause was developing day by day, and a new burden fell on Zhou Rujian. In June 1961, he moved with his wife, younger brother, and one-year-old son to the Northern Pastoral Farm, 340 miles west of the Red Border Farm, to build a station. A family of four lived in a 3-square-meter kitchen, eating 32 pounds of grain. Soybean shells, sunflower stalks, and birch bark became their main food.

Half a year later, the family's grain ration increased to 77 pounds, and life began to improve. By this time, 27-year-old Zhou Rujian had built three meteorological stations for the country's border in seven years and was transferred to the relatively better-conditioned Heihe Meteorological Bureau. It seemed that he could take a breather. But in August 1962, the head of the regional meteorological bureau said to him: "There is a task, very arduous, very far away, will you go?"

He asked, "Where is it?"

"Mohe, to be the station chief."

"Where the organization needs me, I will go."

"That place is very hard. Many people can't stay, one by one they left, now only a couple is left, afraid of the cold, they don't go to the observation field in winter, and there have been no reports for half a year. The housing, except for the couple's, only has one room left, and the roof was damaged by the great flood of 1958 and covered with a tarpaulin. These conditions cannot accommodate family members."

"I can live where others can live."

"You should arrange your affairs and set out in the spring."

"I will set out now. Since we need to rebuild the meteorological station, we cannot wait."

On September 16, he left his wife, children, and younger brother who was suffering from tuberculosis, and boarded a wooden boat upstream along the Heilongjiang River. Before setting out, the two people originally planned to accompany him, one of whom deserted because of the hardship. Nine days later, after crossing thousands of miles of the river, he arrived in Mohe. At this time, although it was early autumn, and people in the interior were still wearing shirts, Mohe was already covered in snow, and the mountains were white.

**The Duty of a Communist**

Mohe, the northernmost part of the motherland, has some poetic charm for tourists who come to see the Northern Lights. But for settlers, it means working in conditions with an average annual temperature of -4.9°C, a minimum temperature of -52.3°C, and a frost-free period of only about 80 days a year. Here, there are no railways or highways, and the transportation of materials and communication of information rely entirely on wooden boats on the river and sleds on the ice. Newspapers and letters in the summer can be seen at most once every ten days or half a month. During the seven months of ice cover, they can only be seen twice. As for movies, if you can see three or four a year, you are lucky. As for food, eating two meals of rice a month is good. Vegetables, only potatoes. Due to the extremely slow transmission of information, the document on raising the grain quota issued by the state took half a year to be implemented here. As soon as they got off the boat, their grain ration was reduced from 27 pounds to 13 pounds. Fortunately, someone had bought 1,500 pounds of potatoes for them in advance at a high price, otherwise, how could they have persisted in their daily work and prepared materials for building houses in a state of hunger!

Hardship is also a test of gold. The following May, when the great river thawed, the first boat from Heihe arrived in Mohe. Zhou Rujian's companion, unable to endure the hardship here, parted ways with him. Some old villagers in Beijiang Village did not understand him: "He is really foolish, not returning to the land of fish and rice, but coming here to suffer, not even taking care of his wife and son!" He had different thoughts. Beijiang Village needs meteorological development and scientific development. If there is no talent and technology input, how can this poor and remote place remove its poverty cap? Twenty days later, the second boat arrived in Mohe, and the regional meteorological bureau sent Yuan Huiming and six others to replace Zhou Rujian and the couple. If Zhou Rujian left, he would be sent to the Xunke County Meteorological Station, 2,000 miles downstream to the southeast, where the temperature is higher and transportation is convenient, which would be good for his health and the arrangement of his family. But Zhou Rujian, considering the heavy construction tasks, did not want to leave the work halfway and chose to assist Yuan Huiming instead of leaving. Not long after, he even moved his entire family to Mohe.

Twenty-four years have passed. In 1987, 52-year-old Zhou Rujian handed over the position of station chief to a younger person. At this time, gastric ulcers, arthritis, hepatitis, and severe lumbar vertebral hyperplasia were tormenting him, and the most important thing for him was to treat his illness, but a new task had arrived. The Amur Meteorological Station, 300 miles away from Mohe, was in a semi-paralyzed state of work. The regional meteorological bureau considered sending a person who could hold the fort to be the station chief and thought of Zhou Rujian, but also considered that he and his wife were both ill, which was very difficult. Zhou Rujian said to the director: "Isn't it required to solve the problem in one year? I guarantee it. I will delay my treatment." He brought his nearly 80-year-old mother-in-law from hundreds of miles away to take care of his wife and took the first step towards Amur...

**Willing to Teach the Younger Generation to Love the Border**

Zhou Rujian has three children. His eldest son, Zhou Xuewu, with a college education, teaches the third year of high school at a middle school in Huma County on the banks of the Heilongjiang River. He has the conditions to transfer to a more developed area in the interior, but Zhou Rujian let him settle down and take root in Huma.

His daughter, Zhou Sujuan, is beautiful and just graduated from the Nanchang Meteorological School to work at the Mohe Station. Jiang Jie, who fell in love with her, came from Mohe. Old Zhou asked the young man: "Do you have the preparation to work here long-term?" The young man said, "Yes." Zhou said: "You two love each other, I won't interfere, but I'm just afraid you are of the 'pigeon' type, and in the end, you will take my daughter away!" The young man replied: "If you don't trust me, you can observe me for another 10 years." Zhou Rujian knew that Jiang Jie came to the border willingly and worked excellently, and he liked him from the bottom of his heart.

His youngest son, Zhou Xuejun, also works at the Mohe Meteorological Station. Originally, with Old Zhou's seniority and influence, it would not be difficult to find a unit with better conditions than the Mohe Meteorological Station for his son, but he insisted on placing his son in the most difficult place. Why? He told the reporter: "The future is entrusted to the next generation. What is entrusted? It is not just knowing how to enjoy, sit and eat, and not knowing how to create, but to let them build the country better through hard work. Let them develop the skills of life and work in the most difficult environment, which is more important than anything else. If everyone runs to the good places, the remote areas will become desolate!"

Zhou Rujian left his children in Mohe for other reasons. Since he moved in, he has brought in seven or eight batches of new comrades. To cultivate them, he year after year, spent countless efforts. However, most young people are migratory swallows, and as one batch matures, another batch flies away. Of the 10 people who came in 1980, 9 left, and the remaining one was called from the local village. This phenomenon repeatedly appeared, which made him sad. Later, he changed his mind, selected more workers from the local villages, and at the same time, let his children take the lead in taking root in Mohe and the border of the motherland. He said: "Hard work, and the leading cadres must set an example, and the families of the cadres must take the lead."

**The Station is Home, and Home is the Station**

Zhou Rujian has been at the Mohe Station for 27 years. To enable a batch of new employees to master meteorological business as soon as possible, he almost sacrificed all his spare time. Cloud codes are hard to remember, so he compiled them into mnemonic rhymes to teach everyone. Weather phenomena are difficult to report, so he compiled difficult questions and explained them to everyone one by one. To strengthen individual guidance, he, like an ordinary worker, arranged shifts every year. Every 8 observations per day (once every 3 hours), he was always on the scene. At night, the sky was pitch black, and the 17 or 18-year-old girls were so scared that their bodies trembled, and Old Zhou went to encourage them. In the summer twilight, as soon as they entered the observation field, swarms of mosquitoes attacked like wolves and tigers, and Old Zhou had more bumps on his body than the young people. In severe winters, at minus 40 or 50 degrees, opening the door from the house to the observation field required courage, and Old Zhou was already there. If someone's report was filled out too messily, Old Zhou did not scold them but rewrote it in front of them. This was a silent criticism, a silent instruction.

A young woman told the reporter: "Uncle Zhou is strict at work as the station chief, but in life, he is like a kind father." People often see that among the young men's laughter, there is often Old Zhou's smile; when the girls cry, Old Zhou comes to comfort them. Young people miss home, and their homes are often hundreds or thousands of miles away. During the holidays, he lets them all go home to stay with their parents for about ten days. For this, he mobilized his entire family and other old comrades to take over the duty. Usually, when his family cooks something delicious, he invites the young people to come and satisfy their cravings. When the canteen lacks vegetables, he picks some from his self-cultivated small vegetable garden and sends them over. When guests come to the station, Old Zhou is the one who takes care of them. The station has become Old Zhou's home; the home has joined the meteorological station.

Overwork and long years have consumed his body, and diseases have gradually increased. He has been overworked like an overdue machine that needs maintenance. Recently, he will go south to treat his illness according to the organization's arrangement. People hope he will recover soon.

    男儿到此自豪雄
    ——记漠河（北极村）气象站工程师周儒锵
    本报记者  武培真
    编者按　“祖国的需要就是我的志愿！到祖国最需要的地方去！”这对于五六十年代的广大知识分子来说，既是引以自豪的口号，也是行动的准则。今天，许多青年人对这些口号已感到陌生，甚至有些不可理解。我们发表《男儿到此自豪雄》这篇通讯，报道气象工程师周儒锵同志根据气象事业发展的需要，从广州到漠河扎根，艰苦奋斗27年的感人事迹，希望对许多青年朋友在思考人生价值时能有所启迪。
    周儒锵出生在广州市郊，却在黑龙江西北边陲战斗了33个春秋。他爱自己的子女，却不把他们南迁到繁华的城镇，而让其在北疆定居。他身患多种疾病，上级曾几次要他休养，但他想到一批又一批来到“天边”的青年需要培养照顾，仍超负荷地坚守在岗位上。他虽然没有惊人的业绩，却被人誉为“我们的北极星”。
     北上，北上
    1956年夏，周儒锵被通知到距离哈尔滨以北千里远的霍龙门去建气象站。对刚从长春部队转业到哈尔滨气象台的周儒锵来说，继续北上，又是一次考验。虽然，这位5年前（17岁时）瞒着全家参军的小伙子已适应了北国寒冷的气候和高粱、玉米的膳食，但如何安置因父母双亡而刚刚接到身边的7岁弟弟，却成为难题。“组织的召唤，是我行动的指南。”周儒锵没打折扣，立即将弟弟托付给同事，毅然动身，开始了住破碉堡、点煤油灯、吃山野菜、熬土豆汤的生活。
    1960年1月，他又奉调到霍龙门以东300里处的红色边疆农场筹建气象站，并动员妻与弟同行。这里，没有砖房，没有“干打垒”，房屋由柳条篱笆糊大泥制成，从屋外能看到屋里。冬天，睡觉需戴棉帽；早晨起床，被上已结上厚厚的冰霜……
    国家气象事业逐日发展，新的担子又落到周儒锵身上，1961年6月他又携妻子、弟弟及一岁幼子转移到距红色边疆农场以西340里的北方畜牧农场去建站。一家4口人，住一间3平方米的厨房，吃32斤粮食。豆壳、向日葵秆、桦树皮成了他们的重要食品。
    半年后，全家口粮增至77斤，生活开始好转。至此，27岁的周儒锵已在7年中为祖国边疆创建了3个气象站，他又被调到条件较好的黑河地区气象台。按说，可以喘息一阵了。但1962年8月，地区气象台负责人找到他说：“有个任务，很艰巨，很远，你去不去？”
    他问：“什么地方？”
      “漠河，当气象站站长。”
      “组织需要，我就去。”
    “那地方很苦。许多人呆不住，一个个离开了，现在只剩下一对夫妇，因怕冷，冬天不上观测场，半年没有报表了。住房，除那对夫妇俩住的外，只剩一间，房顶已被1958年大水冲坏，用苫布盖着。这种条件不能带家属。”
      “人家能生活，我就能生活。”
    “你先安排一下，开春动身。”
    “我现在就动身。既然要复建气象站，是不能等待的。”
    9月16日，他撇下妻儿和患肺病的弟弟，乘木船沿黑龙江上行。上路前，原定跟随同往的两人，有一人因怕苦当了逃兵。9天之后，穿越了上千里江段，到达漠河。此时，虽是初秋，关内还穿衬衣，漠河却大雪弥漫，群山皑皑。
          共产党员的本份
    漠河，祖国的最北端，对于到这里观看北极光的旅游者来说，自然有些诗意。但对于定居者来说，意味着要在年平均气温零下4.9℃、最低温度零下52.3℃、全年无霜期只有80来天的条件下工作，困难重重。这里，没有铁路、公路，运送物资和沟通信息全靠江上木船和冰上爬犁。报纸、信件夏天最快也得十天半月看上一次，待到封江的7个月里，只能见到两次。至于电影，一年能看上三四场就算眼福不浅。说到吃的，一月吃上两顿大米就不错了。蔬菜，只有土豆。由于信息传递极慢，国家提高粮食指标的文件颁发半年，这里还未贯彻。一下船，他们的口粮便从27斤减为13斤。多亏有人事先为他们高价买下了1500斤土豆，要不怎能在饥肠辘辘的状态下坚持日常业务和为建房备料呢！
    艰苦，亦是试金石。来年5月中旬，大江解冻，来自黑河的第一班船到达漠河，周儒锵的同行者因不能忍受这里的艰苦而与他分道扬镳了。北极村有些老乡对他不理解：“他真傻，放着鱼米之乡不归，偏来这里受罪，连妻子儿子都不管！”对此，他别有衷肠。北极村，需要发展气象，需要科学开发。如果没有人才科技输入，穷乡僻壤又怎能摘掉穷帽子呢？20天之后，第二班船开到漠河，地区气象局派来了袁惠明等6人接替周儒锵和那一对夫妇。周儒锵如果离去，他将被派往东南下行2000里的逊克县气象站当站长，那里气温较高，交通方便，对自己的身体和安置全家无疑是好事。但周儒锵考虑到基建任务缠身，难以马上脱手，宁愿在这里充当袁惠明的助手，也不忍工作中途受损。时过不久，他干脆把全家迁至漠河。
    24年过去了。1987年，52岁的周儒锵将站长让位给年轻人。此时，胃溃疡、关节炎、肝炎、胫椎骨质增生严重地折磨着他，对他来说，最首要的是治病，但新任务又降临了。离漠河300里外的阿木尔气象站工作处于半瘫痪状态。地区气象局考虑选派一位压得住阵脚的人任站长，想到了周儒锵，但又考虑到他和妻子都有病，十分为难。周儒锵向局长说：“不是要求一年解决问题吗？我包了。治病我拖一拖。”他从数百里以外接来年近80的岳母照顾妻子，自己迈开了向阿木尔的脚步……
          愿教后生爱边陲
    周儒锵有3个孩子。大儿子周学武，大学文化程度，在黑龙江畔的呼玛县中学任高中三年级班主任。他有条件调到内地比较发达的地区，但周儒锵让他在呼玛成家、扎根。
    女儿周素娟容貌俊秀，刚从南昌气象学校毕业来到漠河站工作的姜刿爱上了她。老周问小伙子：“你有无长期在漠河干下去的准备？”小伙子说：“有”。周说：“你们相爱，我不干涉，但我就怕你是‘飞鸽’型的，到时把我姑娘也拐走！”小伙子回答：“您要信不过，就再考察我10年。”周儒锵知道姜刿是自愿来到边疆的，工作又出色，打心眼里喜欢。
    小儿子周学君也在漠河气象站工作。本来，凭老周的资历和影响，为儿子找一个比漠河气象站条件更好的单位并非难事，但他偏要把儿子安置在最艰苦的地方。这是为什么？他告诉记者：“未来寄托在下一代身上。寄托什么？不是只知享受、坐吃山空、不知创造，而是让他们靠艰辛的劳动把国家建设得更美好。让他们在最困难的环境下练就生活、工作的本领，这比什么都重要。都往好的地方跑，边远的地区不就荒芜了？！”
    周儒锵把孩子留在漠河，还有其他原因。他自从进驻这里，已分来七八批新同志。为培养他们，他年复一年，不知花费了多少心血。然而，大多数年轻人都是不恋窝的燕子，成熟一批，飞走一批。1980年来的10个人，竟走了9人，剩下的一个还是从本地农村召来的。这种现象一再出现，不禁使他伤感。后来，他改变了主意，多从本地农村选拔工作人员，同时，让自己的子女带头在漠河和祖国边陲扎根。他说：“艰苦奋斗，领导干部必须做表率，干部家属必须带好头。”
      站就是家，家就是站
    周儒锵到漠河站27年了，为使一批批新上岗的年轻人早日掌握气象业务，他几乎牺牲了全部业余时间。云码不好记，他编成口诀教大家。天气现象编报不好搞，他汇编出难点问题逐条讲给大家。为加强个别辅导，他像普通职工一样常年排班。每昼夜8次观测（3小时一次），次次他都在现场。夜空漆黑，十七八岁的小姑娘吓得浑身哆嗦，老周为她们去壮胆。夏日黄昏，一进观测场，成群的蚊子如狼似虎地向人攻击，老周身上的疙瘩比小青年还要多。严冬，零下四五十度，从屋里到观测场，开门都要有闯劲，老周早就在那里了。谁的报表填写太乱，老周不训斥，当面替你重抄一遍。这是无声的批评，无声的教导。
    有位女青年告诉记者：“周伯伯工作上是严格的站长，生活上像慈祥的父亲。”人们常看到，小伙儿开怀欢笑中，常夹杂老周的微笑；姑娘挥泪，老周到跟前安慰。小青年恋家，而他们的家，又多在百里、千里之外。逢年过节，他把他们统统放走，让他们到父母身边呆上十来天。为此，他动员自己全家和其他老同志把值班包下来。平素，他家做了好吃的，把青年们叫来解馋。食堂缺了菜，从自家开荒种的小菜园中摘些送去。站里来了客人，招待不及有老周顶着。站，成了老周的家；家，等于加入了气象站。
    超负荷的操劳，漫长的岁月，消耗着他的体魄，疾病逐渐增多。他损耗太多了，像超期运转的机器一样需要检修了。近日，他要按组织安排南下治病了。人们盼望他早日康复。
