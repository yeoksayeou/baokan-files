Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and placing the development of agriculture in an extremely important position is a top priority for the entire Party and the nation. How to make China's agriculture, especially the production of major agricultural products, return to a path of sustained and stable increases is a matter of great concern to the people across the country. To this end, on the one hand, we need to improve the external conditions of agriculture, and on the other hand, we need to enhance the internal vitality of agriculture and comprehensively improve the level of agricultural modernization. This article will offer some opinions on the latter.

Comprehensive improvement of the level of agricultural modernization is the key to enhancing the comparative benefits of agricultural production.

The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China set the goal of achieving modernization of industry, agriculture, national defense, and science and technology as the fundamental strategic objective for the development of China's national economy. This is of great significance. Over the past decade, reforms in the rural economic system and adjustments in the economic structure have provided a strong impetus for agricultural modernization, resulting in significant progress in many areas.

However, it should also be noted that the level of agricultural modernization in China lags significantly behind industrial modernization. First, the starting point of agricultural modernization is relatively low; second, due to the natural conditions and socio-economic conditions inherent in agriculture, the development of agricultural modernization over the past decade has lagged behind that of industry; third, subjectively, effective measures have not been taken to ensure that these two modernizations develop in sync. This gap has resulted in lower levels of intensification, scale efficiency, labor productivity, and commercialization in agriculture, especially in the production of major agricultural products, compared to industry. This has led to a decline in the comparative benefits of agriculture, especially the production of major agricultural products, and even to a contraction in production. This is particularly evident in some coastal developed regions and suburban areas of large and medium-sized cities: first, a large number of "sideline households" that focus on industry have emerged in these regions, treating agriculture as a sideline and engaging in extensive management or even allowing land to lie fallow. Their attitude towards land is: "unwilling to cultivate, unwilling to cultivate more, unwilling to put in effort to cultivate." They only seek self-sufficiency in grain and are unwilling to invest more in agriculture. Second, some purely agricultural households in these regions, although they wish to become wealthy through agriculture, face low comparative benefits in agricultural production due to the low level of agricultural modernization and limited land area, compared to township enterprises.

How to solve the problem of declining comparative benefits in agriculture, especially in the production of major agricultural products? This requires simultaneously addressing two interdependent aspects. On the one hand, we need to gradually curb inflation, adjust the price structure, appropriately increase state investment in agriculture, and improve "industry-subsidizing-agriculture and industry-building-agriculture," to improve the external conditions of agriculture. On the other hand, we must appropriately improve the level of agricultural modernization according to local conditions, to enhance land productivity, labor productivity, and economic benefits, and fundamentally improve the comparative benefits of agriculture. Historically, developed countries in the early stages of industrialization had significant differences in labor productivity and per capita income levels between industry and agriculture, and between urban and rural areas. Later, they gradually equipped agriculture with modern industry and science and technology, significantly improving the labor productivity, land productivity, and per capita income levels of agriculture, thereby greatly narrowing the gap between industry and agriculture, and between urban and rural areas, and bringing the income levels of farmers and urban workers closer together. In recent years, in some developed coastal regions and suburban areas of large and medium-sized cities in China, under the same macroeconomic conditions as the rest of the country, they have begun to explore the implementation of appropriate scale management, improving the level of agricultural modernization, and enhancing land productivity, labor productivity, and income levels. This has made the comparative benefits of farmers who engage in farming and grain production roughly catch up with those who engage in industrial and commercial activities. For example, in Nanhai County of the Pearl River Delta, a survey of 5,397 agricultural specialist households in 1986 showed that the average cultivated land per household was 54.2 mu, with an average annual net income of 249.4 yuan per mu, and an average annual income of 4,614 yuan per labor force, which is 2.6 times the income of general labor, basically reaching or exceeding the income level of farmers engaged in industrial and commercial activities. In the Yangtze River Delta region of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, 80-plus agricultural mechanization demonstration villages had emerged by 1987, with significant improvements in agricultural labor productivity and land productivity, and rapid growth in household income. In these places where appropriate scale management has been successfully implemented, farmers have a certain ability for self-accumulation and expanded reproduction. In Shunyi County, a suburban district of Beijing, the annual net income per mu for agricultural scale management households is 180 yuan, of which 18-38 yuan can be used for expanded reproduction. Of course, overall, their current self-accumulation ability is still at a low level.

Comprehensive improvement of the level of agricultural modernization should focus on enhancing land productivity.

There should be a comprehensive understanding of agricultural modernization. It includes the mechanization, electrification, and chemicalization of production materials, the scientificization of production technology, the irrigation and gardening of production conditions, the improvement of production varieties, the specialization, regionalization, and socialization of production organization, and the enterprise management of operations. These six aspects are interdependent and complementary, forming an organic whole. Of course, agricultural mechanization is very important, but agricultural modernization should not be simply understood as agricultural mechanization, nor should one aspect be emphasized while ignoring the others, as that would be incomplete and the effect would not be good.

The purpose of comprehensively improving the level of agricultural modernization is to comprehensively enhance the land productivity, labor productivity, commercialization rate, and economic benefits of agriculture. However, given China's national conditions, the focus should be on enhancing land productivity and economic benefits. China has a large population and limited land, and the improvement of agricultural labor productivity must be based on the improvement of land productivity. The history of agricultural modernization in developed countries shows that countries with abundant land and labor shortages, such as the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union, first focused on agricultural mechanization to improve labor productivity, solving the problem of labor shortages. On the other hand, countries with limited land and a large population, such as Japan, first focused on irrigation, chemicalization, and improved varieties, striving to increase per unit area yield. Most regions in China currently face the main contradiction of abundant labor, limited cultivated land, and insufficient agricultural products, urgently requiring the improvement of irrigation, gardening, chemicalization, improved varieties, and scientific production technology closely related to the improvement of land productivity. This will increase the intensity of operations to achieve the goal of increasing both per unit area yield and total yield. In China's agricultural modernization, emphasizing the improvement of land productivity as the center is of great significance. Based on actual conditions, various regions should strive to improve per unit area yield. First, it is beneficial to quickly improve economic benefits; second, it is beneficial to alleviate the contradiction of abundant labor and limited cultivated land; third, it can increase effective supply and is beneficial to solving the contradiction of insufficient agricultural products.

To effectively achieve the central goal of improving land productivity and economic benefits, the following links should be firmly grasped in China's agricultural modernization: First, scale management and intensive management should be combined. Expanding the scale of land management should be based on intensive management, with improving land productivity and economic benefits as the main goal. Therefore, the expansion of the scale of land management must be appropriate. If the scale is too large, management will be extensive, and land productivity will decrease, losing the meaning of scale management. Second, agricultural modernization should be combined with the technical advantages of China's traditional organic and ecological agriculture. Fully utilizing organic fertilizers, crop rotation, intercropping, relay cropping, and multiple cropping with ecological agriculture and other traditional technologies, after improvement and enhancement, combined with modern agricultural technology, can improve land productivity and avoid or reduce the environmental pollution and decline in soil organic fertility caused by the single "petroleum agriculture" of Western developed countries. Third, specialized production and appropriate diversification should be combined. Both the specialization and commercialization of crop farming and the active development of related livestock farming should be promoted. This not only benefits the improvement of land productivity and economic benefits but also can achieve a virtuous cycle in both economic and ecological terms. Fourth, agricultural modernization should be combined with science and technology education. The development of agricultural modernization largely depends on the level of scientific and technological knowledge of the people. According to the analysis of American scientists, 81% of the increase in agricultural production and 71% of the improvement in production efficiency in the United States are attributed to scientific research. Currently, the effect of scale management in China is also closely related to the quality of the managers. The basic characteristic of units with good management effects is that the household head is wealthy and strong, with a certain level of scientific and cultural knowledge and practical experience, understands technology, is good at management, is willing to work hard, and possesses a dual quality of being both an "entrepreneurial type" and a "hardworking type." Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the training, improvement, and assessment of managers and to make great efforts in agricultural education.

Maintaining and improving the household contract responsibility system, comprehensively improving the level of modernization of various types of household operations.

After the implementation of the household contract responsibility system, will household operations hinder agricultural modernization? Practice has proven that it does not hinder but rather is a relatively good form of promoting agricultural modernization. This is because: first, household operations can mobilize farmers' enthusiasm for their own production and management to the greatest extent, which is decisive for improving the efficiency of agricultural production. Agricultural production is different from industrial production. Its labor objects are living plants and animals, greatly influenced by changes in natural conditions. Therefore, to achieve high efficiency in agricultural production, it is particularly necessary for laborers to have high enthusiasm and initiative, and to pay close attention to and manage them at all times. The most effective form to achieve this is household operations. Second, household operations are economic units that are self-responsible for profits and losses, mainly using the labor force of family members for production and management. Their members have a high degree of unity in economic interests, and laborers, managers, and managers are unified within one family. Therefore, without complex and strict management systems and labor remuneration systems, the enthusiasm and initiative of laborers and managers can be fully mobilized, and the labor force and semi-labor force within the family can be fully adjusted and utilized. This is of great significance both under the conditions of backward agricultural productivity and under the conditions of modernization. Third, household operations, in order to pursue the development of production and the improvement of economic benefits, have a high enthusiasm for the use of advanced tools and scientific technology. After the implementation of the household contract responsibility system in China, farmers have generally launched a "purchase of agricultural machinery" campaign. During the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period, the total power of newly added agricultural machinery in rural areas was equal to 44% of the total of the previous 28 years, and the growth in the number of small tractors was equal to 1.04 times the total of the previous 28 years. The above advantages of household operations can be said to be a commonality in agricultural operations in China and abroad. In highly modernized agricultural developed countries, the proportion of family farms has always been 80-90% or more, and their economic benefits are often higher than those of large farms.

Currently, the average land area per household in China's household operations is only 7.65 mu. The small scale is indeed disadvantageous for agricultural modernization. This is mainly because it is not conducive to the play of large-scale, high-efficiency agricultural machinery; it is not conducive to unified planning and implementation of agricultural land construction; it is not conducive to the concentration of funds and the use of advanced technology and equipment. However, these are not insurmountable. As long as appropriate measures are taken on the basis of improving the household contract responsibility system and the dual management system, these disadvantages can be transformed under certain conditions. These measures are:

(1) In areas with conditions, implement the paid transfer of land, so that land can be concentrated in the hands of those who are good at farming, and implement appropriate scale management. The main conditions are: first, the non-agricultural industry in the locality is relatively developed, with a relatively large number of labor force transferred from land and can obtain relatively stable income, and thus willing to transfer the contracted arable land; second, the labor force engaged in pure agriculture has the ability to manage the expanded land and is willing to bear the risk of management; third, agricultural mechanization and socialized services are relatively developed, making it convenient for those who contract more land to manage. The above conditions are relatively mature in some places in coastal developed regions and suburban areas of large and medium-sized cities. Currently, such scale management mainly has four forms: family farms, joint household farms, specialized teams, and collective farms. All well-managed scale management farms have three unchanged but appropriately improved items: collective land ownership, household contract responsibility system, and the combination of separation and integration, dual management system. In this way, the fundamental system and policy for mobilizing farmers' production enthusiasm since the reform can be maintained for a long time. Second, the scale of management should be appropriate to achieve the best benefits. Foshan City has summarized the principle of "three self-main" which is self-owned labor force, self-owned funds, and self-owned technology as the main, which is an important boundary of appropriateness.

(2) In most areas of the country where there are no conditions to expand the scale of operations, the level of agricultural modernization can also be improved. Modern agricultural science and technology and tools, in terms of their relationship with farm size, can be divided into three categories: the first category is that the benefits of their promotion and application are closely related to the size of the farm, and only under the condition of large-scale farms can the benefits be realized. Such as the use of large tractors and combines in planting and agricultural land construction. The second category is that the benefits of their promotion and application are not closely related to the size of the farm, and both large and small farms can use them effectively. Such as breeding technology, improved varieties, rational use of fertilizers and pesticides, comprehensive utilization of resources, agricultural product processing and storage technology, etc. The third category is that their effective promotion and application are more suitable for small-scale farms. Such as certain labor, capital, and knowledge-intensive technologies, including intercropping, relay cropping, and multiple cropping technologies, fine farming technologies, film covering, greenhouse, shed and other facilities, and agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery and other ecological agricultural technologies, as well as through land diagnosis, reasonable fertilization according to land, etc. soft technologies. The above two and three categories of modern agricultural science and technology are completely suitable for effective promotion and application in small-scale family farms; the first category of large agricultural machinery is not suitable for small-scale family farms, but can be organized for agricultural machinery socialized services or changed to medium and small agricultural machinery.

Under the condition of unchanged land scale, how can small-scale family operations improve the level of modernization and economic benefits? Three successful methods have emerged in practice: first, family farms carry out specialized production cooperation and contiguous planting. Such as the family farm cooperative created by Suibin Farm in Heilongjiang, with land concentrated in one piece, agricultural machinery configured as a set, producing together and settling accounts separately. Although it is a loose cooperation, it has obvious scale benefits. Second, give full play to the advantages of socialized services and scientific and technological services of village and township cooperative organizations. In many counties and villages in Northeast China and North China, the support services for agriculture at the county and village levels are relatively good. Farmers voluntarily hand over the plowing, harrowing, rolling, sowing, irrigation, pest control, and harvesting of large fields to service companies for unified implementation, and have achieved good scale benefits. Third, implement high-efficiency intensive management. Such as the multi-form intensive management of grain and vegetable vertical planting, grain and vegetable vertical planting, and grain and vegetable vertical planting in Beiguan Garden Village, Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, has accounted for 72% of the village's farmland, with an average net income of 500-1000 yuan per mu, and the highest reaching 1400 yuan.

(3) Explore and create a path of agricultural mechanization suitable for small-scale family operations. It should be seen that for a considerable period of time, most regions of the country will still be dominated by small-scale family operations. The agricultural machinery manufacturing department and the scientific and technological department should start from this national condition and design and develop medium and small agricultural machinery and corresponding technical facilities suitable for small-scale family operations. In the history of agricultural mechanization development in various countries, there are two different approaches: the United States and Canada, with vast land and sparse population, use large agricultural machinery, and Japan, with a large population and limited land, use small agricultural machinery. In recent years, the most popular agricultural machinery in China has been small four-wheel, small walk-behind tractors, and small agricultural machinery. We believe that farmers' choices and market supply and demand laws will promote China to take a path of agricultural mechanization suitable for small-scale family operations.

    全面提高我国农业的现代化水平
    詹武
    农业是国民经济的基础，把发展农业放在极为重要的地位是摆在全党全民面前的头等大事。今后如何使我国农业特别是主要农产品生产重新走上持续稳定增产的道路，已成为全国人民十分关心的问题。为此，一方面需要改善农业的外部条件，另一方面需要增强农业的内在活力，全面提高农业现代化水平。本文仅对后者讲一点意见。
    全面提高农业现代化水平，才能提高农业生产的比较利益
    党的十一届三中全会把实现工业、农业、国防和科学技术现代化，作为发展我国国民经济的根本战略目标。这是具有重大意义的。十年来农村经济体制改革和经济结构调整，使农业现代化获得了强劲的推动力，从而在许多方面有了明显的进展。
    但也应看到，我国农业现代化水平比工业现代化有着相当大的差距。一是由于农业现代化的起点就比较低；二是由于农业本身的自然条件和社会经济条件方面的原因，使十年来农业现代化的发展仍然滞后于工业；三是由于主观上没有采取有效措施，使这两个现代化尽可能保持同步发展。这种差距造成了农业特别是主要农产品生产的集约程度、规模效益、劳动生产率和商品率等方面均明显低于工业，并导致农业特别是主要农产品生产的比较利益下降甚至生产出现萎缩。这在某些沿海发达地区和大中城市郊区表现尤为突出：一是这些地区涌现出大量以工为主的“兼业户”，把农业当副业，经营粗放甚至土地荒芜。他们对土地的态度是：“不愿不种，不愿多种，不愿下功夫种”。只求粮食自给，不愿多向农业投入。二是这些地区的某些纯农业户，虽然想靠农致富，但因农业现代化水平低和土地面积有限，农业生产的比较利益显著低于乡镇企业。
    如何解决农业特别主要农产品比较利益下降的问题？这必须同时抓好相互依存的两个方面。一方面，要逐步制止通货膨胀，调整价格结构，适当增加国家对农业投入，改进“以工补农建农”等，以改善农业外部条件。另一方面，必须因地制宜地全面提高农业现代化水平，以提高土地生产率、劳动生产率和经济效益，从根本上提高农业的比较利益。历史上，发达国家在工业化前期，工农业间、城乡间在劳动生产率、人均收入水平等方面的差别都很大。后来用现代工业和科学技术逐步装备农业，使农业的劳动生产率、土地生产率、人均收入水平都大大提高，从而使工农差别、城乡差别大大缩小，农民和城市职工的收入水平接近起来。我国近几年来，在某些发达的沿海地区和大中城市郊区，在与全国同样的宏观经济条件下，也开始探索实行适度规模经营，提高农业现代化水平，提高土地生产率、劳动生产率和收益水平的一些路子，从而使务农种粮的农民的比较利益大体赶上了务工经商的农民。例如，珠江三角洲的南海县，1986年对5397户农业专业户的统计，户均耕地54.2亩，亩均年纯收入249.4元，每个劳力年均收入4614元，相当于一般劳力收入的2.6倍，基本达到或超过务工务商农民的收入水平。长江三角洲的苏、锡、常地区，1987年已涌现出80多个农业机械化先行村，农业劳动生产率、土地生产率都显著提高，农户收入迅速增长。这些适度规模经营搞得好的地方，农民有了一定的自我积累扩大再生产的能力。北京市郊顺义县农业规模经营户每亩年纯收入180元中，有18—38元可用于扩大再生产。当然，总的说他们目前的自我积累能力还是低水平的。
    全面提高农业现代化水平，要以提高土地生产率为中心
    对农业现代化应有个全面的理解。它包括生产资料的机械化、电气化、化学化，生产技术的科学化，生产条件的水利化、园林化，生产品种的良种化，生产组织的专业化、区域化、社会化，经营管理的企业化。这六个方面是相互促进、相辅相成的有机整体。当然，农业机械化是十分重要的，但不能把农业现代化单纯理解为农业机械化，也不能只重视某一个方面而忽视其他方面，那是不全面的，效果也是不好的。
    全面提高农业现代化水平的目的，是要全面提高农业的土地生产率、劳动生产率、商品率和经济效益。但根据我国的国情，必须把重点放在提高土地生产率和经济效益上。我国人多地少，农业劳动生产率的提高必须建立在土地生产率提高的基础上。发达国家农业现代化的历史表明，土地多、劳力缺的美国、加拿大、苏联等国，首先重点抓农业机械化，提高劳动生产率，以解决劳力不足的矛盾。而地少人多的日本则首先重点抓了水利化、化学化、良种化，努力提高单位面积产量。我国多数地区当前主要矛盾是劳力多、耕地少、农产品不足，迫切要求搞好同提高土地生产率联系密切的水利化、园林化、化学化、良种化和生产技术科学化，提高经营的集约程度，以达到提高单产和总产的目的。在我国农业现代化中，强调以提高土地生产率为中心，具有重要的意义。各地根据实际情况，努力提高单产，一是有利于较快提高经济效益；二是有利于缓解劳力多、耕地少的矛盾；三是可以增加有效供给，有利于解决农产品不足的矛盾。
    为了有效实现提高土地生产率和经济效益这个中心目标，在我国农业现代化中要紧紧掌握下列各环节：一、规模经营与集约经营相结合。实行扩大土地经营规模，应以集约经营为其基础和前提，以提高土地生产率和经济效益作为主要目标。因此，扩大土地经营规模必须适度。如果规模过大，经营粗放，土地生产率下降，那就失去了规模经营的意义。二、农业现代化要同我国传统的有机农业、生态农业的技术优点相结合。充分利用有机肥料、轮作、间种、套种、复种与生态农业等传统技术，经过改进提高，与现代农业技术结合起来，以提高土地生产率，尽量避免或减少西方发达国家单纯“石油农业”所造成的污染环境、土地有机肥力下降等弊端。三、专业化生产与适当的多种经营相结合。既要提高种植业专业化、商品化水平，又要积极发展与种植业相关的养殖业。这不但有利于提高土地生产率和经济效益，而且能在经济上和生态上起到良性循环。四、农业现代化与科技教育相结合。农业现代化发展很大程度上取决于人们掌握科学技术的水平。据美国科学家分析，美国农业增产的81％和生产效率提高的71％归功于科研。目前我国规模经营的效果也同经营者的素质密切相关。凡经营效果好的单位，其基本特征是户主年富力强，有一定科学文化知识和实践经验，懂技术，善经营，会管理，且能吃苦，具有“经营型”和“苦干型”相结合的双重素质。因此，必须抓紧对经营者的培训、提高和考核，在农业教育上狠下功夫。
    坚持完善联产承包责任制，全面提高各类农户经营的现代化水平
    在实行家庭联产承包责任制后，家庭经营会不会妨碍农业现代化？实践证明它不仅不妨碍，而且是促进农业现代化的一种较好形式。这是因为：一、家庭经营能最大限度地调动起农民关心自己生产经营的积极性，这对于提高农业生产的效率具有决定性的作用。农业生产不同于工业生产，它的劳动对象是有生命的植物和动物，受自然条件变化的影响很大，因而要使农业生产获得高效益，就特别需要劳动者具有很高的积极性和主动性，随时给予高度的关心和管理。而要做到这点，最有效的形式就是家庭经营。二、家庭经营是以家庭为自负盈亏的经济单位，主要使用家庭成员的劳动力从事生产经营。其成员在经济利益上有高度的一致性，劳动者、经营者、管理者统一于一家之中，因此，不需要复杂严密的管理制度和劳动报酬制度，就能最大限度地调动劳动者和经营管理者的积极性和主动性，充分调剂使用家庭中的劳力和半劳力。这不论在农业生产力落后条件下或现代化条件下，都具有非常重要的意义。三、家庭经营为了追求生产的发展和经济效益的提高，对使用先进工具和科学技术有很高的热忱。我国在实行家庭联产承包责任制后的几年中，农民普遍掀起了“购买农机热”，“六五”期间农村新增农机总动力等于前28年总数的44％，其中小型拖拉机增长量等于前28年总数的1.04倍。上述家庭经营的优越性，可以说是中外农业经营中的共性。在农业高度现代化的发达国家中，家庭农场的比重始终占80—90％以上，他们的经济效益往往高于大农场。
    目前，我国家庭经营的土地面积每户平均只有7.65亩。规模小，对农业现代化确有其不利的一面。这主要是：不利于大型高效农业机械效益的发挥；不利于统一规划和实施农田基本建设；不利于集中资金力量，采用先进的技术设备。但是这些不是不可克服的。只要在完善家庭承包责任制和双层经营体制基础上采取适当的措施，这些不利因素即可在一定条件下得到转化。这些措施是：
    （1）在有条件的地方，实行土地有偿转包，使土地向种田能手集中，实行适度规模经营。条件主要是：第一，当地非农产业相当发达，有较多的劳动力从土地上转移出来，并可获得较稳定的收入，因而愿意转出承包的耕地；第二，专务农业的劳动力有能力经营规模扩大后的土地，并愿承担经营风险；第三，农业机械化和社会化服务较发达，使承包较多土地者便于经营。以上条件，在沿海发达地区和大中城市郊区的一些地方比较成熟。现在，这样的规模经营主要有家庭农场、联户农场、专业队组和集体农场等四种形式。凡是办得好的规模经营农场，一是都实行土地集体所有制、家庭联产承包制和统分结合、双层经营体制三不变而又适当加以完善。这样，就保持了改革以来借以调动农民生产积极性的这项根本体制政策的长期稳定。二是经营规模适度，才能取得最佳效益。佛山市等总结出“三自为主”即自有劳力为主、自有资金为主、自有技术为主的原则，就是适度的一个重要界限。
    （2）在全国大多数没有条件扩大经营规模的地方，也能提高农业现代化水平。现代农业科学技术和工具，就其同农场面积大小的关系说，可分为三类：一类是其推广应用的效益与农场面积大小关系十分密切，只有在大面积农场的条件下，才能发挥效益。如在种植业和农田基本建设上使用的大型拖拉机、康拜因等。二类是其推广应用的效益与农场面积的大小关系并不十分密切，大小农场都可以有效使用。如养殖技术，优良品种，化肥、农药合理使用技术，资源综合利用技术，农产品加工、储藏技术等。三类是其有效的推广应用更适合在小面积农场。如某些劳动、资金、知识密集的技术，包括间、复、套种技术，精耕细作技术，地膜覆盖、温室、大棚等设施，农林牧副渔密切结合的生态农业技术，以及通过土地诊断，实行按土地合理施肥等软件技术等。以上二、三两类现代化科学技术，完全适合在小规模家庭农场有效推广应用；一类大型农机不适用于小规模家庭农场，但可组织农机社会化服务或改用中小型农机。
      在土地规模不变条件下，小规模家庭经营如何提高现代化水平和经济效益？实践中已涌现出三类成功方式：一、家庭农场进行专业化生产协作，连片种植。如黑龙江绥滨农场创造的家庭农场协作体，土地划在一片，农机配成一套，合起来生产，分开来算帐。虽是松散的协作，却有明显的规模效益。二、发挥乡村合作组织较好的社会化服务和科技优势。在东北、华北不少乡、村两级支农服务搞得较好，农民自愿把大田的耕、耙、压、种、灌溉、治虫、收割等环节交给服务公司统一进行，都收到了较好的规模效益。三、实行高效益的集约经营。如山西汾阳县北关园村粮食立体种植、瓜菜立体种植、粮菜立体种植等多种形式的集约经营农田已占全村农田的72％，亩均纯收入高达500—1000元，最高达1400元。
    （3）探索和创造出一条适应小规模家庭经营的农业机械化道路。要看到全国大部分地区相当长期内还是小规模家庭经营占绝对优势的格局。农机制造部门和科学技术部门要从这一国情出发，设计研制出适应于小规模家庭经营的中小型农机和相应的技术设施。在世界各国农业机械化发展史中，就有地广人稀的美国、加拿大采用大型农机具，和人多地少的日本采用小型农机具这样两种不同的路子。我国这几年来农机销售中，最畅销的是小四轮、小手扶拖拉机和小型农机具。我们相信，农民的抉择和市场供求规律将促使我国走出一条适应小规模家庭经营的农业机械化道路。
