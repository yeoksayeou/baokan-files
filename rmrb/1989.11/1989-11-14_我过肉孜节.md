I grew up in Xinjiang, and my home is in an area where many ethnic minorities live. Therefore, even though I am Han, I also enjoy celebrating the festivals of these ethnic minorities.

Today is the Eid al-Adha Festival. I woke up early, and as soon as I stepped out, I saw that my neighbor, Ayi Gul, had already swept the street clean. Before the festival, no matter whose home it is, everyone will paint their houses, sweep their courtyards, get haircuts, take baths, prepare festival food, and sew festival clothes. On the day of the festival, people rush to clean the streets early in the morning. Ayi Gul is a hardworking woman, and everything is already tidy. She is wearing a bright dress with a black suit vest over it. Her two long braids are shiny, and she has a small embroidered hat tilted on her forehead. Her gold earrings shine brightly in the sunlight. Seeing me, her face lit up with the joy of the festival: "Yakshim (How are you)?" "Yakshi (I'm fine)," I replied politely. She smiled and told me, "The children have all gone out to find friends to play with, and my husband has gone to pay New Year's visits. I have to stay at home to receive guests. You must come to my house, okay?" I nodded in agreement. On this day, the streets are filled with men and women in colorful clothes, bustling with activity. In the early morning, adult men go to the mosque to pray, then go to sweep the graves and recite scriptures, and afterward, the whole family eats "flour soup." By the time they finish all this, Han people are just getting up, but they have already invited friends to pay New Year's visits.

I quickly tidied up and went to pay a New Year's visit to Ayi Gul. Her house still had the smell of freshly painted walls, and there were already many Han, Uyghur, Kazakh, Hui, and Russian friends sitting inside, drinking milk tea, eating fried bread, and enjoying fruits. The atmosphere was very harmonious. Everyone was eating, talking, and laughing. Despite the different ethnicities, there was no sense of restraint.

Uyghur elder Buyimiti told me that the Eid al-Adha Festival is a festival for ethnic minorities who believe in Islam, such as the Hui, Kyrgyz, Uyghur, and Kazakh peoples. "Eid al-Adha" means fasting (i.e., reducing food intake). In ancient times, to avoid the invasion of other ethnic groups, people hid in the mountains and did not dare to cook during the day, only daring to cook at night. Over time, this became a custom. Originally, on the day of the Eid al-Adha Festival, people would not drink a drop of water or eat a grain of rice during the day, only eating after nightfall. This way of life lasted for about a month before returning to normal eating habits. Later, it was found that fasting for a month during the day would affect physical strength and production, so this practice was abolished. Listening to the elder's words, I was glad that this practice had been abandoned; otherwise, I wouldn't be able to enjoy so many delicious foods.

I visited one family after another, everywhere feeling the warmth and hospitality of the ethnic minorities.

    我过肉孜节
    韩平
    生长在新疆，家又住在少数民族聚居的地方，因而我这个汉人也喜欢过少数民族的节日。
    这天是肉孜节。我起了个大早，一出门便看见邻居阿依古丽大嫂已将街道扫得干干净净。过节前，不论是谁家，都要粉刷房屋，扫扫庭院，理发、洗澡，准备好节日吃的食品，缝制好节日盛装。到了节日这一天，人们争着起早打扫街道。阿依古丽大嫂是个勤快人，一切都已收拾整齐了。只见她身着艳丽的连衣裙，上面罩一黑色西服背心，两条大发辫梳得油光发亮，绣了花的小花帽偏扣在脑门上，金耳环在阳光映照下发出耀眼光泽。见到我，她脸上荡漾着节日的喜庆：“牙克西木（您好吗）？”“牙克西（你好）。”我以礼相还。她笑盈盈地告诉我：“巴郎（小孩）们都出去找伙伴玩了，丈夫也去拜年了，我得呆在家中接待拜年的朋友们，你可一定要来我家哟。”我点头答应了她。节日这天，街上红男绿女，熙熙攘攘，很热闹。清晨，成年男子去清真寺做礼拜，完后接着去扫墓，诵经，然后全家吃“粉汤”，这一切忙完时，汉族人按平时习惯才起床呢，而他们却已约上好友去拜年了。
    我匆匆收拾了一下，便去给大嫂拜年。大嫂的屋里还散发着石灰粉粉刷过的味道，已有很多拜年的汉族、维吾尔族、哈萨克族、回族、俄罗斯族朋友坐在那里喝着奶茶、吃着油炸馓子，品尝着水果，气氛很融洽。大家吃着，说着，笑着，尽管民族不同，却没有一点拘束感。
    维吾尔族老大爷买买提告诉我，肉孜节是信仰伊斯兰教的回族、柯尔克孜族、维吾尔族、哈萨克族等少数民族的节日。肉孜就是封斋（即减食）的意思。古时候人们为了躲避异族统治的侵犯，就躲进深山，白天不敢生火作饭，只有等到晚上才敢做饭。时间久了成了一种风俗。原来每逢到了肉孜节这天，人们白天滴水不饮，粒米不沾，要到晚上才能吃东西，这样的生活约持续一个月，才能恢复正常的饮食习惯。后来觉得一个月白天不进食，要影响体力、影响生产，就取消了。听着大爷的话，我庆幸这一条已废弃，要不可品尝不上这么多美味了。
    我走了一家又一家，到处感受到少数民族兄弟的热情。
