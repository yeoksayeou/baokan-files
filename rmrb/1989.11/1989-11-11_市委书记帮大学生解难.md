The municipal party secretary of our city, Gōng Pǔhàn, takes the letters and visits from the masses seriously. On October 5 of this year, Secretary Gōng received a letter from a student from Shāndōng Industrial University who is from Xīntái. The student's family of six lives in a mountainous rural area, relying on cultivating contracted land for a living, and their life is quite difficult. Later, two brothers in the family were admitted to university. The village took back their contracted land, and now the family of four has to support six people, making their economic situation very difficult. The student hopes that for university students from rural areas who have not yet secured a formal job, their contracted land at home can be retained.

This letter caught Secretary Gōng's attention. Based on relevant policies and local conditions, he immediately instructed: "Studying requires money, and expenses have increased significantly. The land has also been taken back. In such cases, I think we can make an exception. Before the student has a fixed income, the land should not be taken back." He told his colleagues: "We support the education cause, how do we support it? Some well-off villages have implemented scholarships, but our entire city cannot afford it. Taking care of the land is something we can do." He immediately arranged for staff to contact the county and township where the student is located, and at the same time informed all counties and townships under the city's jurisdiction that if similar issues arise in the future, they can handle them appropriately.

    市委书记帮大学生解难
    我市市委书记公丕汉，认真对待群众来信来访。今年10月5日，公书记收到山东工业大学一位新泰籍学生的来信。那位学生全家6口人，在山区农村，靠耕种责任田为生，日子过的比较紧。后来，他兄弟二人考上大学，村里将他二人的责任田收回，现在家里种4口人的地养活6口人，经济上很困难。他希望对农村来的大学生在未有正式工作之前，继续保留在家中的责任田。
    这封信引起了公书记的重视。他根据有关精神和当地实际，当即批示：“上学本需花钱，支出明显增加，地又收回，像这种情况我看可变通一下，当学生未有固定收入之前，土地暂不收回。”他对身边的同志说：“我们支持教育事业，怎么支持？一些条件好的村庄实行了奖学金，我们全市无力实行，照顾点土地还是能够做到的。”他马上安排工作人员与那位学生所在乡镇联系，同时转告市属各乡镇，以后再遇此类问题，可酌情处理。
