Over the past 10 years, China's health diplomacy has both served and supported foreign policy, achieving remarkable results.

In the past decade, China has invited 45,700 foreign medical experts to exchange academic knowledge in China, hired 390 foreign visiting professors, and sent 3,000 exchange personnel abroad. Among them, 110 Chinese experts have served as technical advisors and visiting professors overseas. By introducing new technologies such as genetic engineering and cell engineering, China has significantly improved its basic medical research capabilities. Over the past 10 years, China has sent more than 10,000 medical students abroad for further studies, accounting for 1/8 of the total number of students sent abroad.

Through official, private, and international organization channels, China has received over $200 million in various forms of health funding and $300 million in World Bank loans over the past 10 years. This has become an important supplement to China's health funds.

Currently, China has 53 professional cooperation centers recognized by the World Health Organization, and more than 50 international conferences on professional medical and health topics are held in China each year.

The number of foreign students studying traditional Chinese medicine in China has surpassed the number of foreign students studying natural sciences, making it the highest among all fields.

Additionally, since 1963, China has sent medical teams to more than 60 third-world countries, providing free medical services to 170 million people and training over 2,000 local health professionals. Many medical team members have been honored with titles such as "Medical Ambassador" and various national medals.

    10年中，我国邀请各国医学专家4.57万人次来华交流学术，聘用外国客座教授390人；派出交流人员3000多人次，有110位我国专家出任国外的技术顾问和客座教授。引进遗传工程、细胞工程等新技术，大大提高了我国基础医学研究水平。我国10年派出1万多名医学进修留学人员，占派出留学总人数的1／8。
    我国通过官方、民间渠道和国际组织，10年来共获得各种形式的卫生费用资助2亿多美元、世界银行贷款3亿美元。这已成为我国卫生资金的重要补充。
