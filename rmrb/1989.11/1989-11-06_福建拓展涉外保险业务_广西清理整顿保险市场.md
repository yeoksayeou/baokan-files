Fujian Expands Overseas Insurance Business, Guangxi Cleans Up and Regulates Insurance Market

FUZHOU, Nov. 6 (Xinhua) — "When investing in China, having an insurance company as a reliable backer gives me peace of mind," said a foreign investor from the joint venture Zhanghua Vineyard Co., Ltd. after receiving over 100,000 Hong Kong dollars in compensation from the insurance company following a fire. The company not only fulfilled its export contract without delay but also doubled its investment, expanding its product line from one to 29 varieties. The investor credited the insurance company for resolving the urgent issue.

In Fujian, many joint ventures have benefited from insurance companies. All cities and counties along the coast, totaling 32, have established overseas insurance services, offering 86 types of insurance. This has laid the foundation for an outward-looking insurance system. The province has handled over 16,000 overseas insurance claims, paying out $19.41 million in compensation, earning praise from domestic and international clients and investors.

To expand the scope of overseas insurance business, the Fujian Provincial Insurance Company has actively established agency networks with foreign trade, local trade, travel agencies, and branches of the Bank of China. Insurance personnel have accompanied trade exhibition teams abroad, ensuring that all contracts include insurance coverage before they are signed. To attract the West Lake Hotel, a joint venture, the Fujian Provincial Insurance Company made over 30 visits, adopting flexible measures in terms of rates, clauses, and methods. Despite competition from foreign counterparts, they successfully secured a property insurance contract worth 110 million yuan.

NANNING, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) — The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region government recently decided to clean up and regulate the insurance market across the region. The government will firmly shut down any units that operate insurance businesses without approval, lack business licenses, or engage in disguised insurance activities. This move aims to protect legitimate businesses and promote the healthy development of the insurance industry.

In recent years, the insurance industry in Guangxi has developed rapidly, establishing a network that covers both urban and rural areas. There are now over 100 insurance companies and social insurance institutions. These institutions have played a positive role in promoting economic development, ensuring people's livelihoods, and maintaining social stability. However, there have been varying degrees of chaos. Some units have operated insurance businesses without approval; others have created disguised insurance activities; some have blurred the lines between government and enterprise, using administrative means to conduct business; some have operated insurance businesses without paying taxes or registering with the industrial and commercial administration; and others have failed to comply with relevant insurance regulations. These issues have disrupted the normal order of the insurance market, harmed the interests of insured parties, and to some extent, led to disorder in the economic order.

After thorough investigation and research, the Guangxi government has decided to take the following measures to regulate the insurance market: First, shut down the 11 insurance institutions that were established without approval from the People's Bank of China and registration with the industrial and commercial administration. Second, strictly supervise the business scope of approved insurance institutions to prevent them from arbitrarily or disguisedly expanding their business scope. Third, handle the aftermath of shut-down insurance business institutions by transferring relevant procedures and relationships to the China People's Insurance Company's affiliated institutions.

    福建拓展涉外保险业务  广西清理整顿保险市场
    本报福州电　记者张铭清报道：“在国内投资办企业，有了保险公司这个可靠后盾，我就放心了。”这是合资企业漳华藤业有限公司的外商接受保险公司10多万港币的赔款，恢复生产后的感慨。他的这家公司遭受火灾后，不但没影响出口合同的履行，而且投资额翻番，产品由1种发展到29种，多亏保险公司为他解了燃眉之急。
    在福建，受惠于保险公司的何止这一家合资企业。全省各地市和沿海32个县都开办了涉外保险业务，开办86个险种，初步形成外向型保险体系。已处理涉外保险赔案1.6万多件，支付赔款1941万美元，赢得了国内外客户和投资者的赞誉。
    为了扩大涉外保险业务范围，福建省保险公司积极与外贸、土贸、旅行社、中国银行等分支机构广泛建立代理网点。业务人员随贸易展销团出国展业，使所有成交合同100％在国内带保险成交，为争取合资企业西湖大酒店在国内投保，福建省保险公司30多次上门展业，在费率、条款、办法上采取灵活措施，在与国外同行竞争中终于达成了保额高达1.1亿元的财产保险合同。
    本报南宁11月4日电　记者蒋耀强报道：广西区政府日前作出决定：在全区范围内清理整顿保险市场，坚决取缔那些未经批准、没有营业执照、擅自经营或变相开办保险业务的单位，保护正当经营业务，促使保险事业健康发展。
    近几年，广西保险事业发展很快，初步形成遍布城乡的保险网络，已有保险公司和社会办的保险机构百余个。这些保险机构，为促进经济发展，保障人民生活和社会安定，起到了积极作用。但也不同程度地存在着混乱现象。有的单位未经批准，擅自开办保险业务；有的巧立名目，变相开办保险业务；有的政企不分，借用行政手段开展业务；有的开办保险业务不依法纳税，不向工商部门注册登记；还有的不执行有关保险规定等。这些现象的存在，扰乱了保险市场的正常秩序，损害了被保险人的利益，一定程度上导致了经济秩序的混乱。
    广西区政府通过深入的调查研究，决定采取以下措施整顿保险市场：一是对已查出的11个未经人民银行批准、工商行政部门注册登记而成立的保险机构，坚决予以取缔；二是对获准开办保险业务的机构，严格监督其经营业务范围，防止擅自或变相扩大业务范围；三是对取缔的保险业务机构做好善后工作，将有关手续和关系转给中国人民保险公司所属机构。
