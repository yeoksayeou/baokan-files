The First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly (Political and Security Committee) unanimously passed a resolution proposed by China today, urging the U.S. and Soviet Union to reach an agreement on halting the nuclear arms race and further reducing nuclear weapons.

The resolution "urges the Soviet Union and the United States, which possess the most significant nuclear arsenals, to fulfill their special responsibilities for nuclear disarmament, take the lead in stopping the nuclear arms race, and expedite negotiations to reach an agreement on substantial reductions in their nuclear arsenals."

The resolution also welcomes the continued implementation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

Before and after the passage of the resolution, there were no explanatory speeches, nor were there any reservations. This indicates that the core idea proposed by China in the resolution—that the U.S. and the Soviet Union bear special responsibilities for nuclear disarmament—continues to receive widespread support from the international community.

The resolution will be submitted to the 44th session of the UN General Assembly for approval.

Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, November 10th

The First Committee of the UN General Assembly today passed a resolution urging South Asian countries to continue efforts to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region.

The resolution, proposed by Bangladesh and Pakistan, notes that establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia "will help consolidate the security of the countries in the region and prevent the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons."

The resolution calls on South Asian countries to avoid actions that run counter to this goal and urges nuclear-weapon states to respond positively and cooperate.

The proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia was first made by Pakistan in 1974 and was approved in principle by the 29th session of the UN General Assembly. This resolution will be discussed at the plenary session of the UN General Assembly tomorrow.

    联大一委一致通过我国提案
    敦促美苏加快核裁军步伐
    还通过决议呼吁建立南亚无核区
    本报联合国11月10日电　记者刘开宸报道：联合国大会第一委员会（政治和安全委员会）会议今天一致通过中国提出的核裁军决议草案，呼吁美苏就制止核军备竞赛和进一步削减核武器达成协议。
    决议草案“敦促拥有最重要核武库的苏联和美国进一步履行它们对核裁军负有的特殊责任，率先采取行动以停止核军备竞赛，并为早日达成大幅度削减其核武库的协议加紧进行谈判”。
    决议草案还欢迎美苏继续实施消除两国中程和中短程导弹条约。
    会议通过该决议草案前后，没有任何解释性发言，更无任何保留意见。这表明中国在草案中提出的美苏对核裁军负有特殊责任的核心思想仍然得到国际社会的普遍支持。
    该决议草案将提交第44届联大批准。
    新华社联合国11月10日电　联大第一委员会今天通过一项决议，敦促南亚国家继续为将该地区建设成无核区而努力。
    这项由孟加拉国和巴基斯坦提出的决议指出，在南亚建立无核区“有助于巩固这一地区国家的安全、防止使用或威胁使用核武器”。
    决议要求南亚国家避免采取同这一目标背道而驰的行动，呼吁拥有核武器的国家作出积极的反应并给予合作。
    建立南亚无核区的建议是首先由巴基斯坦于1974年提出的，并得到了第29届联大原则上同意。这项决议明天将提交联大全体会议进行讨论。
