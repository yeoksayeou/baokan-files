Deyang's strategy of leveraging key enterprises to drive the development of small and medium-sized enterprises has significantly boosted the city's economy. In 1988, compared to 1983, the city's total industrial and agricultural output value increased from 2.34 billion yuan to 5.8 billion yuan, and local fiscal revenue rose from 199 million yuan to 425 million yuan. This has propelled Deyang's economic strength from the 8th position to the 3rd position among large and medium-sized cities in Sichuan Province. This year, grain production surpassed the 2 billion kilogram mark for the first time. From January to October, the city's industrial output value grew by 8.24% and fiscal revenue increased by 12.11%, both ranking among the top in the province.

Deyang City consists of 4 counties and 1 district, with a population of 3.4 million and an average of 0.9 mu of arable land per person. The city's above-ground and underground resources are not particularly abundant. How can Deyang's economy take off? The municipal Party committee and government, based on the city's status as a key base for heavy machinery, power equipment manufacturing, and phosphate chemical industries, and its relatively strong talent and technological capabilities, have adopted the policy of "large enterprises leading small ones, small ones supplementing large ones, and both large and small enterprises developing together." They have chosen the path of large factories supporting small ones and state-owned enterprises aiding township enterprises.

Following this approach, more than 30 state-owned key enterprises in the city have engaged in horizontal cooperation, internal and external linkages, and product dissemination. Simultaneously, they have provided technical and talent support to small and medium-sized enterprises and township enterprises. The Dongfang Electric Machinery Factory has successively driven the development of 12 small and medium-sized enterprises, including the Yangjia Machinery Factory, Guanghan Machinery Factory, and Dongfang Cable Factory. The Deyang Second Heavy Machinery Factory has solved technical problems related to electricity, boilers, and air conditioning for more than 20 township enterprises. The Dongfang Steam Turbine Factory has organized a technical support team for township enterprises, providing targeted, location-specific, and timely technical services. Over the years, the team has resolved more than 200 technical issues for township enterprises and has been awarded the title of "Advanced Collective in Supporting Township Enterprises" by the provincial government.

Statistics show that over the years, more than 3,000 technical personnel from key enterprises in the city have provided technical services to township enterprises, conducted more than 1,100 technical training sessions, trained over 38,000 people, and transferred 273 technological achievements. This has benefited 460 enterprises, with 193 of them achieving economic doubling.

With the strong support of state-owned key enterprises, Deyang's township enterprises have emerged rapidly. Last year, the total output value of township enterprises reached 3.54 billion yuan, achieving a tax revenue of 180 million yuan. The development of township enterprises has absorbed 440,000 rural laborers and accumulated a large amount of funds for agriculture. Over the years, the municipal and county governments have invested 87.71 million yuan in agriculture.

    以骨干企业带动中小企业发展
    德阳财政收入五年翻番
    经济实力从四川省内第八位跃居第三
    本报成都11月17日电　记者罗茂城报道：四川省德阳市坚持以骨干企业带动中小企业，促使全市经济迅速发展。1988年与1983年相比，全市工农业总产值从23.4亿元增至58亿元，地方财政收入从1.99亿元增至4.25亿元。其经济实力在全省大中城市中由第8位跃居第3位。今年，粮食总产量首次突破20亿公斤大关；1至10月工业总产值比上年同期增长8.24％，财政收入增长12.11％，仍居全省前列。
    德阳市现有4县1区，340万人口，人均耕地0.9亩，地上地下资源并不丰富。如何才能使德阳经济起飞呢？市委、市政府根据本市是我国重型机械工业、动力设备制造工业、磷化工业的重要基地，大企业较多，人才技术力量较雄厚等特点，制定了“以大带小，以小补大，大小并举”的方针，走大厂带小厂、国营厂矿帮乡镇企业发展的路子。
    按照这一思路，该市30余家国营骨干企业开展横向联合、内引外联和产品扩散。同时，从技术、人才上积极支援中小企业和乡镇企业。东方电工机械厂先后带动了杨家机械厂、广汉机械厂、东方电缆厂等12个中小企业的发展。德阳第二重型机器厂，为20余家乡镇企业解决了电气、锅炉、空调等技术难题。东方汽轮机厂专门组织乡镇企业技术扶贫小组，定向、定点、定时技术服务，几年来为乡镇企业解决技术难关200余项，被省政府授予“支援乡镇企业先进集体”的称号。
    据统计，几年来，全市骨干企业科技人员以科技服务的方式，到乡镇企业的人数达3000多人次，为乡镇企业举办各类技术培训班1100多期，受训人数达3.8万多人，转让成果273项，使460多家企业受援，其中有193家受援企业实现经济翻番。
    在国营骨干企业的大力支援下，德阳市的乡镇企业异军突起。去年，全市乡镇企业总产值达35.4亿元，实现税利1.8亿元。乡镇企业的发展，吸收了44万农村劳动力，为农业积累了大量资金。几年来，市、县两级财政对农业投资达8771万元。
