According to the Secretariat of the Macau Basic Law Consultative Committee, from the official publication of the "Draft of the Macau Basic Law Structure" until November 7, the committee had received 50 consultation opinion books with a total of 281 suggestions. Currently, the Secretariat is classifying, summarizing, and will, along with future collected opinions, submit them to the third plenary meeting of the Drafting Committee to be held in Guangzhou on November 18 for reference.
