Two Brazilian Chinese nationals, Ji Youju and Ji Youyi, were recently arrested on charges of organizing and facilitating the illegal emigration of Chinese citizens. The arrest was approved by the Shanghai People's Procuratorate.

On September 8, the Shanghai Hongqiao Airport border inspection station discovered that 43 passengers had forged Brazilian visas in their Chinese passports while processing their departure formalities. The 43 passengers and their escorts, Brazilian Chinese nationals Ji Youju and Ji Youyi, were detained for questioning.

It has been confirmed that Ji Youju, a 31-year-old woman, and Ji Youyi, a 30-year-old man, are siblings and originally from Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, China. They have since obtained Brazilian citizenship. In August of this year, the two arrived in China from Brazil. They used forged Brazilian entry visa stamps and forged signatures of Brazilian embassy officials to organize and facilitate the illegal emigration of Chinese citizens, charging each person thousands of dollars in fees. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau seized the tools used in the crime from their residence in Shanghai. Ji Youju and Ji Youyi have both confessed to the crimes. The case is currently under further investigation.

    组织运送公民非法出境  两名巴西籍华人被逮捕
    新华社北京11月3日电  记者今天从公安部刑侦局了解到，9月8日，被上海虹桥机场边防检查站阻留审查的两名巴西籍华人季友菊、季友艺，最近经上海市人民检察院批准，以组织、运送他人偷越国境罪予以逮捕。
    今年9月8日，上海虹桥机场边防检查站在办理旅客出境手续时，发现有43名旅客所持中国护照上的巴西国签证是伪造的，遂将这43名旅客及带队的巴西籍华人季友菊、季友艺阻留审查。
    现已查明，季友菊，女，31岁；季友艺，男，30岁，两人系姐弟关系，原均为我国浙江省青田县人，现已加入巴西国籍。二季于今年8月从巴西来华，采用伪造巴西入境签证印章及假冒巴西驻华使馆官员签名的手段，组织、运送中国公民非法出境，每人收取手续费及路费数千美元。上海市公安局已从他们在上海的住处搜获了藏匿的作案工具。上述犯罪事实，季友菊、季友艺均供认不讳。目前，此案正在进一步审理。
