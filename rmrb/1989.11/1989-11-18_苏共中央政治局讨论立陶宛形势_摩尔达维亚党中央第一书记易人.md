The Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Politburo on November 16 pointed out that Lithuania is facing numerous contradictions in its reform process, which is related to the intensified activities of forces holding anti-socialist and nationalist positions. This has hindered the progress of reform. The party organizations in that republic often lag behind the situation and have not consistently and timely armed party members and workers with clear political direction.

According to TASS, the Politburo at its meeting on November 16 listened to a work report by the first secretary of the Lithuanian Communist Party Central Committee, Brazauskas, and discussed the development of the situation in Lithuania with the members and alternate members of the Lithuanian Party Central Committee.

The Politburo's special meeting to discuss the situation in a republic and summon the local top leaders to the capital is an unusual move, indicating that the Soviet leadership is concerned about the situation in Lithuania.

The Soviet Communist Party Central Committee member Lutsenko was elected on November 16 at the plenary session of the Moldavian Communist Party Central Committee to replace Grosu as the first secretary of the Moldavian Communist Party Central Committee.

Lutsenko has been serving as the second secretary of the Tajik Communist Party Central Committee in recent years.

    苏共中央政治局讨论立陶宛形势
    摩尔达维亚党中央第一书记易人
    新华社莫斯科11月16日电  苏共中央政治局16日指出，立陶宛在改革过程中矛盾重重，这同持有反社会主义和民族主义立场的势力加紧活动有关，妨碍了改革的进程。该共和国的党组织往往落后于形势，未能一贯及时地用明确的政治方向武装党员干部和劳动人民。
    据塔斯社报道，苏共中央政治局在16日的例会上听取了立陶宛共和国共产党中央第一书记布拉藻斯卡斯作的工作报告，并同该共和国党中央常委和候补常委一起讨论了立陶宛的形势发展。
    政治局开会专门讨论一个共和国的问题，而且把当地主要领导召来首都，这一不寻常的举动表明苏共领导对立陶宛形势感到不安。
    新华社莫斯科11月16日电  据塔斯社报道，苏共中央委员卢钦斯基在16日举行的摩尔达维亚共和国党中央全会上，接替格罗苏当选为摩尔达维亚共和国共产党中央第一书记。
    卢钦斯基最近几年任塔吉克共和国共产党中央第二书记。
