According to a report in the *Beijing Daily* yesterday: "Tough times are ahead, but bonuses will not be canceled." In response to recent rumors that "all bonuses will be canceled next year," Beijing Municipal Bureau of Labor Director Gong Shujie stated at a meeting of district, county, and bureau (general company) labor department heads on November 21 that these rumors are false.

In recent times, Beijing has seen numerous rumors about the cancellation of all bonuses next year. For example, "The state's finances are in trouble, so starting next year, factories, offices, and schools will all cancel bonuses." Some even claim, "The relevant central departments have issued a document," and "Unit X has already canceled bonuses." These rumors have had a negative impact on some people. Director Gong Shujie clearly pointed out that these rumors are groundless.

Gong Shujie said that bonuses have created a tiered distribution system, embodying the socialist principle of "more pay for more work," and have played an important role in motivating the broad masses of workers. Currently, bonuses account for about one-third of workers' wages in most enterprises, and this cannot be canceled. Rectifying and tightening the economy, reducing total social demand, and excessive consumption funds, and living frugally do not mean that bonuses will not be issued.

He said that during the rectification period, production must also develop at an appropriate speed. Enterprises with good production and operations and high efficiency will see corresponding increases in workers' wages and bonuses next year. Currently, a few enterprises with poor production and operations and significantly reduced efficiency issuing less or no bonuses is normal.

However, he reminded everyone: Speaking of living frugally for a few years also means that wages and bonuses will not increase as rapidly as in the past. Because rectification and tightening will inevitably cool down the overheated economy, enterprises' economic efficiency cannot increase as rapidly as in the past, and the growth rate of workers' wages and bonuses will naturally also have to "cool down."

### 北京市劳动局长郑重宣布　明年取消奖金系谣言　效益差的企业少发或不发

　　北京市劳动局长郑重宣布
　　明年取消奖金系谣言
　　效益差的企业少发或不发
    本报讯　据《北京日报》昨天报道：“紧日子要过，但奖金不会不发。”针对最近社会上出现的“明年将全都取消奖金”的谣传，北京市劳动局长龚树基在21日召开的全市区、县、局（总公司）劳动部门负责人会上郑重辟谣。
    近一个时期，北京出现了不少关于明年全都取消奖金的传闻。如“现在国家财政困难，从明年起工厂、机关、学校全部取消奖金”，有的甚至说：“中央有关部门已发了文件”，“××单位已经取消了奖金”……这些谣言在部分群众中已造成不良影响。龚树基局长明确指出，上述传闻纯属无稽之谈。
    龚树基说，奖金拉开了分配上的档次，体现了社会主义多劳多得的原则，对调动广大职工的积极性起了重要作用，目前一般企业中奖金已占职工工资收入的1／3左右，这一块不可能取消。治理整顿、压缩社会总需求和过高增长的消费基金，过紧日子，绝不等于不发奖金。
    他说，治理整顿期间，生产也要以适当速度发展。生产经营好、效益高的企业，明年职工工资、奖金照样会相应有所提高。当前，个别生产经营差，效益大幅度下降的企业，少发或发不出奖金也是正常的。
    不过，他提醒大家：讲过几年紧日子，当然也包括工资奖金不会再像过去那样快增长的意思在内。因为治理整顿必然要使过热的经济降温，企业的经济效益不可能再像过去那样大幅度的提高，职工工资、奖金的增长速度自然也要相应“降温”。
