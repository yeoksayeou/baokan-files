Jinan's state-owned commerce sector supports production in multiple ways

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, November 4th - (Reporters Lu Dianluo, Correspondent Lu Weihua) The wholesale and retail enterprises of Jinan's First Commercial Bureau are facing the current sluggish market and the situation where some industrial enterprises' products are not selling well. Starting from the overall stability of the economy, they have played the role of the main channel of state-owned commerce, actively expanded the sales channels, helped production enterprises solve problems, and strongly supported industrial production.

Jinan Department Store Procurement and Supply Station is a key enterprise of the First Commercial Bureau. Since early October, the station manager, secretary, and union chairman led three sales teams to 36 counties and cities within the province, visiting 64 wholesale companies and key supply and marketing cooperatives. In just over 10 days, they sold goods worth 4.81 million yuan. Da Guan Yuan Commercial Center, one of the six major retail stores in Jinan, set up 10 fixed and mobile sales points in the industrial and mining areas of Feicheng and Xinwen outside Jinan City. They organized "tent cars" to deliver goods to customers' doors, selling goods worth over 3 million yuan in less than a month.

Recently, the leaders of Jinan's First Commercial Bureau and the heads of various large companies under its jurisdiction visited local key producers of daily-use industrial products. Both sides analyzed the market and discussed sales strategies. They agreed with the relevant production factories to jointly hold commodity exchange fairs, effectively leveraging the strengths of both industry and commerce. In October, five large wholesale companies and relevant production factories jointly held five order meetings and exchange fairs, with a total transaction amount of 15.899 million yuan. Some wholesale enterprises also conducted barter trade within the system to address the issue of tight funds and poor turnover, adjusted the commodity structure, increased effective inventory, and expanded the sales of local products by over 5 million yuan.

Enterprises under the First Commercial Bureau also utilized their advantages of multiple procurement and sales channels and timely market information to provide services for production enterprises, helping to solve issues related to funds and urgently needed raw materials. Jinan Plastic Factory No. 10 is a specialized factory producing slippers. In October this year, the factory's products experienced seasonal backlog, internal funds were tight, and raw materials could not be purchased, making production difficult. After learning about this situation, Jinan Department Store Procurement and Supply Station actively played the role of a "reservoir," promptly purchased the factory's products, and loaned 600,000 yuan to support the factory in purchasing raw materials, ensuring normal production.

In the past half year, various wholesale companies under the First Commercial Bureau have solved and adjusted various production materials for production factories, totaling 23 types and 13,000 tons, timely supporting the increased production and income of short-line products and ensuring market supply.

    工商携手　共度难关
    济南国营商业多方支持生产
    据新华社济南11月4日电  （记者卢殿洛、通讯员卢卫华）济南市第一商业局系统的批发、零售企业面对当前市场疲软，一些工业企业产品滞销的状况，从稳定经济的大局出发，发挥国营商业主渠道作用，积极拓宽销售渠道，帮助生产企业排忧解难，有力地支持了工业生产。
    济南百货采购供应站是一商局的骨干企业，从10月初开始，供应站经理、书记和工会主席带队，组织了3个推销小组，分赴到省内36个县市的64个批发公司和重点供销社，在10多天的时间内就推销了价值481万元的商品。市六大零售商店之一的大观园商场，到济南市外的肥城、新汶等工矿区，设立固定和流动销货点10个，组织“大篷车”送货上门，在不到一个月的时间内销货30余万元。
    最近，济南市一商局的领导和下属各大公司的负责人分别走访了当地日用工业品重点生产厂家，工商双方一起分析市场，商议推销策略。他们与有关生产厂家协商，由工商双方联合举办商品交流会，有效地发挥了工商双方优势。10月份由五大批发公司和有关生产厂家联合举办的5次定货会、交流会，成交总额达1589.9万元。一些批发企业还针对资金紧张、周转不灵的状况，在系统内开展了易货贸易，调整了商品结构，增加了有效库存，扩大当地产品销售500多万元。
    济南市一商局系统的企业还利用购销渠道多，市场信息灵的优势，为生产企业提供服务，帮助解决资金和急需的原材料。济南塑料十厂是个生产凉鞋的专业厂。今年10月，这个厂的产品出现季节性积压，厂内资金紧缺，购不进原料，生产困难。济南百货采购供应站了解这一情况后，主动发挥“蓄水池”作用，及时收购塑料厂的产品，并贷款60万元支持该厂采购原料，保证了正常生产。
    近半年来，一商局各批发公司共为生产厂家解决和调剂了各种生产材料23种，总量达1.3万吨，及时支持了短线产品的增产增收，保证了市场的供应。
