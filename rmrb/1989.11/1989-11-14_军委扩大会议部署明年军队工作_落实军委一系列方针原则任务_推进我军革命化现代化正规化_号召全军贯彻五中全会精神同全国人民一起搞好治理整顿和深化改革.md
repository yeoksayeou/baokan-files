The Central Military Commission (CMC) expanded meeting, which concluded on November 12, emphasized that future military work should continue to implement the theories and a series of policies and principles proposed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping for military construction in the new historical period, and push forward the revolutionization, modernization, and regularization of our army.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping, along with other Party and state leaders, met with all the attendees of the meeting. Comrade Deng Xiaoping delivered a heartfelt and important speech, greatly inspiring and educating the attendees.

This CMC expanded meeting was held after the conclusion of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee and the adjustment of the CMC leadership as decided by the plenary session. It was the first meeting to discuss and deploy the military work for the next year. The attendees unanimously agreed that although Comrade Deng Xiaoping has stepped down from the position of Chairman of the CMC, the theories and policies, principles he proposed for military construction will still be the guidelines for our military construction in the future. The attendees unanimously supported the Party Central Committee's adjustment of the CMC members and were determined to work together under the leadership of the CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the Chairman, to further improve the military work. The meeting called on the entire army to resolutely implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, unite as one, work hard, and together with the people of the whole country, carry out good governance and deepen reforms, to achieve new victories in military construction and reform.

General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman of the CMC Jiang Zemin, and President of the State and First Vice Chairman of the CMC Yang Shangkun attended the meeting and delivered important speeches. Vice Chairman of the CMC Liu Huaqing, and Secretary of the CMC Yang Baibing also spoke.

In his speech, Jiang Zemin highly praised Comrade Deng Xiaoping's historical achievements in leading the military. He said that during the ten years when Comrade Xiaoping presided over the work of the CMC, the revolutionization, modernization, and regularization of the military achieved tremendous success. According to the development and changes in the international situation and the shift in the focus of the Party's work, a strategic transformation of the guiding ideology for military construction was achieved; institutional reforms were carried out, and the task of reducing the army by one million was completed; the leadership cadres at all levels, under the premise of adhering to revolutionization, have significantly improved in terms of youth, knowledge, and specialization; several regulations and statutes were promulgated, and the new military rank system was implemented throughout the army; education and training were strengthened and improved, and the military and political qualities of the troops were improved; significant achievements were made in national defense science and technology. Whether in safeguarding national security and territorial integrity, or in disaster relief, supporting economic construction, and promoting the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, the military has played an extremely important role and made great contributions. Especially in the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing this spring and summer, the broad cadres and soldiers firmly believed in the correct decisions and commands of the Party Central Committee, Comrade Deng, and the CMC, were loyal to the Party, loyal to the motherland, and loyal to the people, were not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice, strictly observed organizational discipline, and demonstrated a high level of political awareness, making new contributions to defending the People's Republic and defending the socialist system. It can be said that these ten years are a period when the army has made continuous progress in reform, significantly enhanced its combat effectiveness, and undergone major changes in appearance, marking a new stage in the development history of our army. All the achievements and progress made in the construction of our army over the past ten years are the results of Comrade Xiaoping's correct leadership, and are condensed with his wisdom and efforts. He combined Marxism with the realities of our army, proposed the policies and principles for strengthening military construction in the new period, enriching and developing Mao Zedong's military thought. Now, although Comrade Xiaoping has retired from his position, his thoughts and theories on military construction in the new period are our precious wealth, with long-term guiding significance for future military construction, and we must seriously study and implement them.

Jiang Zemin pointed out that the history of our revolution and construction over several decades has proven that without a people's army, there would be nothing for the people. The People's Liberation Army is the strong pillar of people's democratic dictatorship and the steel wall of the socialist motherland. He called on the entire Party and governments at all levels to enhance the concept of national defense, actively support and care for the construction of the military.

Jiang Zemin said that adhering to the Party's absolute leadership over the military is the fundamental principle of our military construction, is our Party's fine tradition, and is the unique political advantage of our military, which must be continued and carried forward. History and reality have shown that we must regard strengthening political construction and ensuring the Party's absolute leadership over the military as the primary task of military construction, and at any time, we must firmly grasp the construction of Party organizations at all levels, strengthen and improve ideological and political work, so that the troops maintain a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee in ideology, politics, and action, and remain politically qualified forever.

Jiang Zemin demanded that the military must be strictly managed. He said that our military must maintain and carry forward the good image of obeying the law, having a strict military appearance, and having a strong style in front of the people of the whole country, and not only become a powerful army but also a civilized army.

Jiang Zemin said that this army, under the cultivation of the Communist Party of China, after decades of struggle and tests, has overcome countless difficulties and has developed into such a powerful armed force today. The Party trusts this army, and the people love this army. We must inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of the past, strive for progress, work hard, and continue to advance along the path opened up by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, to make the construction and reform of the military even better.

Yang Shangkun, in his speech, deeply expounded on the great significance of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Party, and required the army to unify their understanding with the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session. He spoke on three issues regarding military work: first, he analyzed the basic situation of military work this year, proposed the guiding ideology for military work next year, and required the entire army to continue to implement the policies, principles, and tasks determined by the CMC, and in the new situation, further strengthen the political construction of our army and comprehensively improve the combat effectiveness of the troops. Second, he emphasized the importance of strengthening the political construction of our army and ensuring the Party's absolute leadership over the military, and proposed fundamental measures for strengthening political construction. Third, he deployed several major tasks around the issue of adhering to the combat effectiveness standard and comprehensively improving the quality of the troops.

The attendees had a thorough and enthusiastic discussion on the situation of military work this year and the guiding ideology for military work next year. Everyone agreed that next year, implementing the series of policies, principles, and tasks determined by the CMC, including adhering to the combat effectiveness standard, strengthening ideological and political work, centering on military training, focusing on regularization construction, strengthening grassroots construction, and comprehensive governance, conforms to the objective laws of military construction in peacetime and the actual situation of the military, and we must resolutely implement them.

The meeting emphasized that strengthening the political construction of the military must lay a solid ideological foundation, and carry out in-depth education on adhering to the four cardinal principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization. Cadres at the regiment level and above, especially senior cadres, must strengthen theoretical learning, systematically read some works of Marx, Lenin, Mao Zedong, and Deng Xiaoping, and master the worldview and methodology of Marxism. Attention must be paid to selecting and appointing cadres at all levels to ensure that the guns are in the hands of those who are loyal to the Party's cause. The construction of the Party within the military must be done well, and the series of fundamental systems of the Party leading the military must be adhered to. The construction of leading cadres at all levels must be strengthened according to the requirements of "learning, unity, integrity, and realism." The Party must be strictly managed, and efforts must be made to improve the quality of Party members, so that the Communist Party members in the military firmly remember the Party's program, are loyal to the Party's cause, observe Party discipline, and fully play the role of vanguards and models.

The meeting pointed out that adhering to the combat effectiveness standard and comprehensively improving the quality of the troops is a basic principle of our military construction. Serious attention must be paid to war preparedness training, strictly implement various regulations, statutes, and rules and regulations, strive to improve logistics support capabilities, strengthen troop management, and implement grassroots work.

The meeting proposed that our Party and state are currently in a very important historical period, and it is of great significance to do a good job in military construction. All comrades in the military, especially senior cadres, should recognize the historical responsibility of the military, be spirited, and strive to build our army into a steel wall to defend the motherland and the socialist cause.

The CMC expanded meeting began on November 10.

Attendees of this meeting also included CMC members Hong Xuezhi, Qin Jiwei, Chi Haotian, Zhao Nanqi, and the responsible comrades of the three general departments and the main responsible comrades of all major units of the military and the armed police headquarters.

    邓小平同志与党和国家领导人会见了参加会议的全体同志。邓小平同志作了语重心长的重要讲话，给到会同志极大的鼓舞和教育。
    这次中央军委扩大会议，是在党的十三届五中全会结束，根据全会决定军委领导成员调整以后召开的第一次会议，主要是研究部署明年军队的工作。与会同志一致认为，邓小平同志虽然辞去了中央军委主席的职务，但他提出的军队建设的理论和方针、原则，今后仍然是我军建设所必须遵循的。与会同志一致拥护党中央对军委组成人员的调整，决心在以江泽民同志为主席的中央军委领导下，齐心协力，进一步做好军队的工作。会议号召全军坚决贯彻党的十三届五中全会精神，同心同德，埋头苦干，同全国人民一起搞好治理整顿和深化改革，夺取军队建设和改革的新胜利。
    中共中央总书记、中央军委主席江泽民，国家主席、中央军委第一副主席杨尚昆出席了会议，并作了重要讲话。中央军委副主席刘华清，中央军委秘书长杨白冰也讲了话。
    江泽民在讲话中高度评价了邓小平同志领导军队的历史功勋。他说，小平同志主持军委工作的十年，军队的革命化、现代化、正规化建设取得了巨大的成就。根据国际形势的发展变化和全党工作重点的转移，实现了军队建设指导思想的战略性转变；进行体制改革，精简整编，完成了裁军百万的任务；各级领导班子在坚持革命化的前提下，年轻化、知识化、专业化程度有了明显提高；颁布了一些条令条例，全军实行了新的军衔制；加强和改进了教育训练，提高了部队的军政素质；国防科技获得了许多重大成果。无论在保卫国家安全和领土完整，还是在抢险救灾、支援经济建设、促进社会主义精神文明建设等方面，军队都发挥了极其重要的作用，作出了很大贡献。特别是在今年春夏之交的制止动乱、平息北京发生的反革命暴乱的斗争中，广大干部战士坚信党中央、邓主席和中央军委的正确决策与指挥，忠于党，忠于祖国，忠于人民，不怕流血牺牲，严守组织纪律，表现了高度的政治觉悟，为捍卫人民共和国、捍卫社会主义制度立下了新功。可以说，这十年是军队在改革中不断前进、战斗力有了很大增强、面貌发生重大变化的十年，是我军发展史上一个崭新的阶段。我军建设十年来所取得的一切成就和进步，都是小平同志正确领导的结果，都凝聚着他的智慧和心血。他把马克思主义和我军的实际相结合，提出了新时期加强军队建设的方针原则，丰富和发展了毛泽东军事思想。现在，小平同志虽然从工作岗位上退下来了，但他关于新时期军队建设的思想和理论是我们的宝贵财富，对今后军队建设有着长远的指导作用，我们要认真学习与贯彻。
    江泽民指出，我国革命和建设几十年的历史证明，没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。人民解放军是人民民主专政的坚强柱石，是社会主义祖国的钢铁长城。他号召全党和各级政府都要增强国防观念，积极支持和关心军队的建设。
    江泽民说，坚持党对军队的绝对领导，这是我们建军的根本原则，是我们党的优良传统，是我们军队特有的政治优势，必须继续保持和发扬。历史和现实的经验都说明，我们必须把加强政治建设，保证党对军队的绝对领导，作为军队建设的首要任务，任何时候都要坚定不移地抓好各级党组织的建设，加强和改进思想政治工作，使部队在思想上、政治上、行动上同党中央保持高度一致，做到政治上永远合格。
    江泽民要求军队要从严治军。他说，我们军队一定要在全国人民面前保持和发扬遵纪守法、军容严整、作风过硬的良好形象，不仅要成为威武之师，而且要成为文明之师。
    江泽民说，我们这支军队，在中国共产党的培育下，经过几十年的斗争考验，战胜了千难万险，已经发展成为今天这样强大的武装力量。党信赖这支军队，人民热爱这支军队。我们要继承发扬过去的优良传统，奋发图强，扎实工作，沿着老一辈无产阶级革命家开拓的道路继续前进，把军队的建设和改革搞得更好。
    杨尚昆在讲话中，深刻阐述了党的五中全会的重大意义，要求把全军的认识统一到五中全会精神上来。他就军队工作讲了三个问题：一是分析了今年军队工作的基本形势，提出了明年军队工作的指导思想，要求全军继续贯彻落实中央军委确定的方针、原则和任务，在新的形势下进一步加强我军政治建设，全面提高部队战斗力。二是强调加强我军政治建设、保证党对军队绝对领导的重要性，提出了加强政治建设的根本措施。三是围绕坚持战斗力标准、全面提高部队素质的问题，部署了几项主要工作。
    与会同志围绕今年军队工作的形势和明年军队工作的指导思想，进行了充分而热烈的讨论。大家认为，明年贯彻军委确定的一系列方针、原则和任务，其中包括坚持战斗力标准，加强思想政治工作，以军事训练为中心，以正规化建设为重点，抓好基层建设，综合治理等，符合和平时期军队建设的客观规律，符合军队的实际情况，我们要坚决贯彻落实。
    会议强调，加强军队的政治建设，必须打好思想基础，深入进行坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育。团以上干部，特别是高级干部要加强理论学习，系统地读一些马列、毛泽东同志的著作和邓小平同志的著作，掌握马克思主义的世界观和方法论。要注意选配好各级领导干部，保证枪杆子掌握在忠实于党的事业的人手里。一定要搞好军队中党的建设，坚持党领导军队的一系列根本制度。要按照“学习、团结、廉洁、求实”的要求，加强各级领导班子建设。要从严治党，努力提高党员的素质，使军队中的共产党员牢记党的纲领，忠诚党的事业，遵守党的纪律，充分发挥先锋模范作用。
    会议指出，坚持战斗力标准，全面提高部队素质，这是我军建设的一条基本原则。要认真抓好战备训练，严格执行各种条令条例和规章制度，努力提高后勤保障能力，加强部队管理，落实基层工作。
    会议提出，我们党和国家目前正处在一个非常重要的历史时期，搞好军队建设有着十分重要的意义。全军同志，特别是高级干部，应当认清军队肩负的历史责任，振奋革命精神，为把我军建设成为保卫祖国、保卫社会主义事业的钢铁长城而努力奋斗。
    中央军委扩大会议是11月10日开始举行的。
