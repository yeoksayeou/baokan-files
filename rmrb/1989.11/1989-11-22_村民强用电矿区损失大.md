Villagers Illegally Use Electricity, Causing Significant Losses for the Mine

The Sifangling Mining Bureau is the largest provincial-owned enterprise in eastern Guangdong, located in Huanghuai Town, Xingning County. During the construction of the mine in 1968, it received strong support from the local government and residents. However, over time, some residents around the mine area have viewed it as a "fat piece of meat" delivered to their doorstep. They use electricity indiscriminately, day and night, with large 100-watt bulbs constantly lit for decorative and Christmas lights. They illegally tap into the power supply for lighting and processing without paying a single cent. More seriously, some villagers use homemade electric heating devices with iron sheets to cook pig feed, causing transformers to frequently burn out due to overload.

The mine leadership has repeatedly requested assistance from the local government to address this issue. The Xingning County government has also attempted to resolve this long-standing problem. However, due to various reasons, this serious issue of energy waste remains unresolved to this day.

Currently, the Sifangling Mining Bureau suffers an annual loss of approximately seven to eight million kilowatt-hours of electricity.

### 村民强用电矿区损失大

　　村民强用电矿区损失大
　　四望嶂矿务局是粤东最大的一家省属企业，座落在兴宁县黄槐镇。一九六八年建矿期间曾得到当地政府和群众的大力支持。但是，随着时间的推移，矿区周围部分群众认为这是送上门的一块“肥肉”，他们不分白天黑夜，节日灯、圣诞灯，一百度的大灯泡始终亮着。强行搭电用于照明和加工等，分文不付。更严重的是，有的村民利用铁片自制电热具用来煮猪食等，变压器也因超负荷运行经常引起烧毁。
    对此，矿领导曾多次向当地政府请求协助解决，兴宁县政府亦试图解决这一久拖不决的老大难问题。但是，由于种种原因，这种严重浪费能源的问题时至今日仍未得到彻底解决。
    目前，四望嶂矿务局每年约损失七八百万度电。
