	Will They Have No Descendants?
	Pan Zhihao

	A female middle school student, daughter of an engineer, after reading a certain author's pornographic literature, ended up as a street prostitute. To avenge his daughter's fall, this engineer harbored the terrifying idea of exacting "blood vengeance" on the author. He angrily cursed: "Do those who write such texts have no children?"—This is not a fabrication by the author, but a true event that occurred in Jiangxi Province.

	"Literature is an eternal pursuit," and Chinese literati have always valued the written word. Most authors, though they do not aspire for their works to be "hidden in famous mountains and passed down to future generations," at least hope that their works will do no harm to society and benefit people. However, a single work can have such a social impact, truly making one feel "a different kind of bitterness in the heart."

	For a long time, sex has been a taboo subject, making contemporary Chinese literature stuck in a stage of adolescent longing, which is certainly not normal. However, in recent years, the depiction of sex in some "literary works" has shown a "rapid progress." Especially with the encouragement of "the first gentleman," the "sexual wind blows the literati drunk," and some authors gradually forget their social responsibilities to the point of vanishing. Their bare and explicit sexual descriptions are undoubtedly a kind of "opium" to people, especially to teenagers. The engineer's stern question, "Will they have no descendants?" is something that those authors who are keen on writing about sex should deeply reflect on and ponder over. Undoubtedly, authors are also ordinary people. Besides spiritual production, they also need their own reproduction, that is, the continuation of the race. They naturally also have the joy of having children and grandchildren. It is not possible that they are all "childless." Therefore, when an author sits down to write about sex or other such works, they must not forget the sincere, eager, and somewhat naive eyes of the young boys and girls—even if you do not consider others, you should think about your own children who may also be readers, and be very careful!

	Speaking of this, I recall a literary anecdote: Every time an author publishes a piece of pornographic literature, when the editorial department sends the sample book, he immediately locks the sample book in the bookcase, keeping it secret from his son. One day, his son took advantage of his absence, picked the lock, and was reading it when he suddenly returned, so the son was beaten black and blue...

	It seems that this author's judgment is intact. He knows that the "spiritual food" he cultivates is indeed "spiritual opium," so he strictly forbids his son from tasting it, showing his good intentions. However, I cannot help but sigh: If so, why do you create this kind of "spiritual opium" for others' children to enjoy? This is truly heartless and unreasonable.

	From this, I think that if the "anti-pornography" campaign only focuses on rectifying publishing houses and bookstalls, it is really like "stirring the soup to stop the boiling." Only when the majority of authors consciously think of their descendants and resolutely do not "create" those obscene things, will it truly be a "removal of the root cause."

    其无后乎？
    潘志豪
    一位工程师的正在念中学的女儿，由于读了某作者的性文学作品，结果沦为街头娼妓。为报女儿堕落之仇，这位工程师萌生了要对某作者施行“血的制裁”的可怕念头。他悲愤地诅咒：难道写这类文字的人都没有子女的吗？——这决非笔者杜撰，而是发生在江西省的一件真人真事。
      “文章千古事”，中国文人历来是珍重文字的。大部分作者虽然不求自己的作品“藏之名山，传诸后世”，但祈愿它于世无害、于人有益却是起码的要求。而现在区区的一部作品却引起了如此社会效应，真令人“别是一般滋味在心头”。
    长期以来，性，一直是讳莫如深的禁区，致使我国当代文学一直处于欲说还休的思春阶段，这当然不正常。然而近几年来某些“文学作品”中的性描述，竟呈现了“突飞猛进”的态势。尤其在赵公元帅的推波助澜下，“性风吹得文人醉”，某些作者对自己的社会责任渐渐淡化到了烟消云散的程度。他们的赤裸裸的性描写作品，对人们尤其是青少年无疑是一种“鸦片烟”。那位工程师发出的“其无后乎？”的厉声责问，是很值得那些热衷于写性的作者扪心自问，反省再三的。无疑，作者也是凡夫俗子，除了精神生产外，还需要自身的生产，即种族的繁衍。他们自然也有儿女绕膝的天伦之乐，断不会个个都是“无后”的。因此，当一个作者坐在案头写作性呀什么的作品时，务必莫要忘了那一双双真诚热切而又不免略显稚嫩的少男少女们的目光——即使你不为他人计，也得想想你自己的孩子完全可能是读者之一，切切珍重！
    写到这里，我倒想起了一件文坛轶事：一位作者每发表一篇性文学作品，当编辑部将样书寄来时，他总立即将样书锁入书橱，秘不示儿。一天，他的儿子趁他外出，撬开书橱，正在诵读之际，他却突然回来了，于是，儿子饱尝了一顿“竹笋拷肉”……
    看来，这位作者的鉴别能力完好无损，他深知自己种植的“精神粮食”实乃“精神鸦片”，所以才严格禁止儿子品尝，用心可谓良苦。然而，我又不得不发一声感叹：既然如此，你却炮制这类“精神鸦片”专供他人子女享用，这又于心何忍，于情何安？
    由此我想到，“扫黄”工作如果仅仅倾全力于整顿出版社和书摊，实在有点“扬汤止沸”。只有广大作者自觉地为子孙后代着想，决不“创作”那些淫秽的劳什子，才真正是“釜底抽薪”之举。
