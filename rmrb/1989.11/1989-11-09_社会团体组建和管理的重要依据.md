The "Regulations on the Registration and Management of Social Organizations" (hereinafter referred to as the "Regulations") have been officially promulgated. This is a major event in the political life of our people and a manifestation of our socialist democratic system. Its promulgation is of great significance in further guaranteeing citizens' freedom of association, protecting the legal rights of social organizations, and strengthening the management of social organizations.

The "Regulations" summarize the experiences and lessons of social organization management in China over the past nearly 40 years, embodying the unity of guaranteeing democracy and improving the legal system. As early as September 1950, the State Council issued the "Provisional Measures for the Registration of Social Organizations." According to these measures, the Ministry of the Interior was responsible for managing social organizations. Later, due to various historical reasons, social organizations in China were in a state of long-term stagnation and dispersed management. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in the new situation of reform and opening up, Chinese citizens' enthusiasm for association has been continuously high, and various types of social organizations have emerged in large numbers, playing a positive role in promoting China's economy, science, culture, education, and other undertakings. However, the management of social organizations has not kept pace, resulting in a series of problems such as repeated establishment, multiple approvals, and chaotic management that need to be solved urgently. Although the "Provisional Measures for the Registration of Social Organizations" were issued in 1950, nearly 40 years have passed, and some of the provisions are no longer applicable. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize the experiences on the basis of the original regulations and formulate new regulations to adjust and standardize citizens' associations and the activities of social organizations. The promulgation of the "Regulations" is in line with this historical trend. Whether in terms of system or specific provisions, it is more accurate and perfect than the first regulation. It is an important legal basis for the establishment of various types of social organizations in China and the state's management of social organizations.

Guaranteeing citizens' right to associate and managing social organizations in accordance with the law are the core contents of the "Regulations." In our country, democracy and the legal system are dialectically unified. Association is a democratic right of citizens and should be protected by law. At the same time, if this right is abused, it should also be restricted by law. Therefore, the establishment of social organizations and their registration in accordance with the law are both an expression of the right to associate and a specific measure for managing social organizations. Through registration, social organizations obtain legal status and social recognition, and can independently carry out activities, thereby guaranteeing citizens' right to associate under the law.

Establishing a unified mechanism for the management of social organizations is the foundation for the legal management of social organizations and an important principle of the "Regulations." The "Regulations" clearly stipulate that the registration and management authority for social organizations is the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the People's Republic of China and the civil affairs departments at the county level and above, thus streamlining the management system for social organizations and ending the previous situation of multiple approvals and chaotic management. Of course, the civil affairs departments manage social organizations mainly from a macro perspective in accordance with the law, and the specific business of social organizations still needs to be guided by the competent business departments.

Like any other "Regulations," the key is to correctly implement them. To quickly implement the various tasks stipulated in the "Regulations," civil affairs departments at all levels need to seriously study the business, train a batch of management talents through training, and so on. First, the staff of social organization management agencies should quickly study the "Regulations," master the professional knowledge, strictly implement the "Regulations," and bring the management of social organizations under the rule of law; second, all citizens exercising the right to associate should study the "Regulations," be familiar with the contents of the "Regulations," and strictly act in accordance with the spirit of the "Regulations."

It can be foreseen that as long as the social organization management agencies and citizens all seriously study and use the law and strictly act in accordance with the law, the social organizations in our country will definitely be able to develop healthily in the socialist direction.

    社会团体组建和管理的重要依据
    本报评论员
    《社会团体登记管理条例》（以下简称《条例》），正式颁布了。这是我国人民政治生活中的一件大事，是我国社会主义民主制度的体现。它的颁布，对进一步保障公民的结社自由，保障社会团体的合法权益，加强对社会团体的管理，具有重要的意义。
    《条例》总结了我国近40年来社团管理的经验和教训，体现了保障民主与健全法制的统一。早在1950年9月，政务院曾颁布过《社会团体登记暂行办法》，根据《暂行办法》规定，内务部承担了社团管理职能。以后，由于种种历史原因，我国社团处于长期停滞和管理涣散的状态。党的十一届三中全会以后，在改革开放的新形势下，我国公民结社热情不断高涨，各类社团大量涌现，对促进我国的经济、科学、文化、教育等事业起了积极作用。然而，社团管理工作并未相应跟上，以致出现社团重复组建、多头审批、管理混乱等一系列急需解决的问题。虽有1950年颁布的《社会团体登记暂行办法》，但时隔近40年，有些规定已不适用，因而，需要在原有法规的基础上总结经验，制定新的法规，以对公民结社和社团活动加以调整和规范。《条例》的颁布，正好顺应这一历史潮流，它无论在体系上，还是在具体条文上都比第一个法规更加准确，更加完善，它是我国各类社团组建及国家管理社团的重要法律依据。
    保障公民的结社权利，同时依法管理社团，是《条例》的中心内容。在我国，民主和法制是辩证统一的。结社是公民的一种民主权利，理应受到法律的保护，同时，如果滥用这种权利，也应受到法律的限制。因此，成立社团依法进行登记，既是结社权利的一种表现形式，又是管理社团的具体措施。通过登记，社团取得法律地位，得到社会承认，就可以独立自主的开展活动，从而使公民的结社权利受到法律保障。
    建立统一的社团管理机制，是依法管理社团的基础，也是《条例》的重要原则。《条例》明确规定：社会团体的登记管理机关是中华人民共和国民政部和县级以上各级民政部门，这就理顺了社团管理体制，结束了过去多头审批、管理混乱的状况。当然，民政部门管理社团，主要是从宏观上依法管理，社团的具体业务，还需要业务主管机关给予指导。
    像其他任何《条例》一样，重要的是正确地贯彻执行。为了尽快地实施《条例》所规定的各项任务，各级民政部门需要认真学习业务，通过开展培训，造就一批管理人才。首先，社团管理机关的工作人员应该尽快学习好
  《条例》，掌握业务知识，严格执行《条例》，使社团管理工作纳入法制轨道；其次，凡是行使结社权利的公民都应该学习《条例》，熟悉《条例》内容，严格按照《条例》精神办事。
    可以预见，只要社团管理机关和公民都认真学法用法，严格依法办事，我国的社团就一定能够沿着社会主义方向健康发展。
