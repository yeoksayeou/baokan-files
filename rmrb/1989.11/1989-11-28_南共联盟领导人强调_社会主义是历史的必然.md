Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, November 26th.

The chairman of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Miloš Pančević, refuted the erroneous view that "socialism is a historical mistake" on the 26th, emphasizing that socialism is a reflection of the historical necessity and regularity of social development.

Pančević made these remarks during a speech at the 10th Congress of the League of Communists of Macedonia in Skopje.

He pointed out that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia should conduct a genuine Marxist critical analysis of the path it has taken, including its contradictions and mistakes, and on this basis, creatively respond to the challenges of the times, and determine the short-term and long-term goals of socialist construction in Yugoslavia.

Pančević stressed that some self-proclaimed "reformers" claim that socialism is a "man-made product and a historical mistake." This view is absolutely unacceptable to the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the working class. These people, under the guise of seeking "new radical solutions," are intentionally or unintentionally advocating the fundamental negation of socialism. He also stated that some people view the failure of a certain socialist model as the failure of world socialism, which is a view lacking any basis. He emphasized that socialism is a reflection of the irresistible desire of the creators of material and spiritual wealth to seek liberation.

Pančević pointed out that public ownership is the foundation of socialism, and it is necessary to improve the economic efficiency of public ownership and its competitiveness with other forms of ownership. He also criticized the erroneous view that public ownership has no future and that complete privatization is the solution.

He stressed that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia should continue to maintain its revolutionary nature and vanguard role in the future, and criticized the view that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia should step off the stage of history and become a debating club.

    南共联盟领导人强调
　　社会主义是历史的必然
    新华社贝尔格莱德11月26日电　南共联盟中央主席团主席米·潘切夫斯基26日晚批驳了所谓“社会主义是历史性失误”的错误观点，强调社会主义是社会发展的历史必然性和规律性的反映。
    潘切夫斯基主席是在斯科普里市举行的马其顿共盟第10次代表大会上发言时说这番话的。
    他指出，南共联盟应该对走过的道路及其矛盾和失误进行真正马克思主义的批判性分析，在此基础上对时代的挑战作出创造性的回答，并确定南斯拉夫社会主义建设的短期和长期目标。
    潘切夫斯基强调，有些自封的“改革派”说什么社会主义是“人为的产物和历史性的失误”，这种观点是南共联盟和工人阶级所绝对不能接受的。这些人假借寻求“新的激进答案”的名义，实际上是在有意无意地鼓吹根本否定社会主义的主张。他还表示，有人把某种社会主义模式的失败看作是世界社会主义的失败，这种观点是缺乏任何根据的。他强调，社会主义是物质财富和精神财富的创造者争取解放的不可遏制的愿望的反映。
    潘切夫斯基指出，公有制是社会主义的基础，必须提高公有制的经济效率和公有制同其他所有制的竞争能力。他还批判了那种认为公有制没有任何前途、只有完全私有化才是解决办法的错误论点。
    他强调南共联盟今后仍应保持革命性和先锋队作用，同时批判了那种想使南共联盟走下历史舞台并变成争论不休俱乐部的观点。
