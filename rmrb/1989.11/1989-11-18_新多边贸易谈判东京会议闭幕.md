The two-day informal meeting of the new round of multilateral trade talks (Uruguay Round) concluded in Tokyo this afternoon. Representatives from twenty-six countries and regions unanimously agreed to strive to conclude the protracted new round of multilateral trade talks by the end of this year.

The representatives also agreed to study the possibility of holding a new round of talks by the end of 1990.

On the issues of agricultural trade and service trade, Japan and Western Europe held different views from the United States, and no consensus was reached. Developing countries expressed dissatisfaction with Western countries' insistence on including service trade in the new round of multilateral trade talks.

    新多边贸易谈判东京会议闭幕
    历时两天的新多边贸易谈判（乌拉圭回合）东京非正式会议十七日下午在东京闭幕。来自二十六个国家和地区的代表一致同意争取于今年内结束旷日持久的新多边贸易谈判。
    代表们还同意，到一九九○年底将研究举行新的回合谈判。
    在农产品贸易问题和服务性贸易问题上，日本和西欧不同于美国的主张，未能取得一致意见。发展中国家对西方国家要把服务性贸易纳入新多边贸易谈判表示不满。
