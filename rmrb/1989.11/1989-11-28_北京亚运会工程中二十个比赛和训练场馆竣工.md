The construction of the Beijing Asian Games is progressing rapidly towards completion, with over 84% of the total investment already transformed into the "stage" for athletic competition. The attention of both domestic and international communities is focused on this project.

Deputy Commander of the Asian Games Construction Headquarters, Zhu Yanji, recently told our reporter that the Asian Games will feature 27 competition events and 2 demonstration events, requiring a total of 33 competition venues and 46 training facilities. Out of the 79 competition and training venues, 31 are newly constructed or expanded competition and training venues. Among these, 20 have been completed, 7 more will be finished by the end of this year, and the remaining 4 will be completed by next May. Of the 20 completed venues, 15 have begun trial operations, while the other 5 are ready for use. The 7 venues, including the Northern Suburbs Swimming Hall, scheduled for completion by the end of this year, have already finished major interior renovations. The structural work for the 4 venues, including the Fengtai Sports Hall, has been completed and they are scheduled to be finished in the spring of next year.

The construction of the Northern Suburbs Athletes' Village Service Center has accelerated in the second half of this year, with over 90% of the structural work completed and interior renovations underway. The exterior renovations for buildings such as the Five Continents Hotel, which will accommodate journalists, and the Huibin Building, which will serve as the headquarters for the organizing committee, have also been completed.

Zhu Yanji also discussed the issue of national acceptance of the Asian Games construction projects. He mentioned that the State Planning Commission has entrusted relevant departments in Beijing and the Asian Games Construction Headquarters to inspect a batch of medium and small-sized sports venues. Large-scale sports venues such as the Northern Suburbs Swimming Hall will be directly inspected by the State Planning Commission. Currently, the quality and other aspects of a batch of newly constructed medium and small-sized sports venues have been basically completed, and the inspection results are satisfactory.

　　北京亚运会工程中二十个比赛和训练场馆竣工
    新华社北京11月27日电　（记者李莉）国内外关注的北京亚运会工程正以越来越快的速度向着终点冲刺，总投资84％以上的资金已经转化为体育竞技的“大舞台”。
    亚运会工程总指挥部副总指挥朱燕吉最近在接受本社记者采访时说，亚运会27个比赛项目和两个表演项目，共需使用比赛场馆33个，训练场地46个。在总共79个比赛和训练场地中，新建和改扩建的比赛和练习用体育场馆共31个，其中已竣工20个，今年年底将竣工7个，还有4个将于明年五月完成。已完工的20个场馆中有15个开始试用，其余5个具备了使用条件。将于今年底完工的北郊游泳馆等7个场馆目前大面积装修已经完成。丰台体育馆等4个场馆已完成结构工程，定于明年春季竣工。
    北郊运动员村服务中心的建设今年下半年进展加快，目前已完成90％以上的结构工程，转入了室内装修。其中，将用于接待记者的五洲大酒店、组委会办公用的汇宾大厦等，外装修也已完成。
    朱燕吉还向记者介绍了人们普遍关心的亚运会工程接受国家验收的问题。他说，国家计委已委托北京市有关部门和亚运会工程总指挥部对一批中小体育场馆进行验收。北郊游泳馆等几座大型体育场馆，国家计委将直接组织力量验收。目前，新建的一批中小体育场馆的质量等5个方面的检查工作已经基本完毕，检查结果是令人满意的。
