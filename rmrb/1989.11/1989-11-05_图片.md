Only 20 years old, Deng Lifang is from Cangtou Xiqiao Village, Wuhui County, Anhui. She works as a domestic helper in Beijing. During the turmoil in the capital, she rescued 26 soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Recently, the Anhui Provincial Women's Federation and her hometown county women's federation both awarded her the "March 8th Red Banner" medal and certificate. The Wuhui County Committee and County Government have decided to call on all county residents to learn from her. The picture shows her (second from the right) having a friendly conversation with her sisters at the provincial women's federation commendation meeting.
