The sixth national conference on key water and soil conservation areas was held in the Lvliang region of Shanxi Province. Reporters learned from the conference that over the past six years, the first phase of the project in eight key water and soil conservation areas has treated 16,300 square kilometers of soil erosion, accounting for 26.8% of the total soil erosion area in these eight key areas. The ecological environment in the treatment areas has shown initial signs of improvement, and production conditions have been enhanced.

In 1982, the State Council designated eight regions, including the Wuding River Basin, Sanchuan River Basin, Huangfu River Basin, Dingxi County in the Yellow River Basin, Liuhe River Basin in the Liaohe River Basin, Yongding River Basin in the Haihe River Basin, the Gezhouba Reservoir area in the Yangtze River, and Xingguo County in Jiangxi Province, as key areas for water and soil conservation. After more than six years of initial treatment, the landscape of soil erosion in these eight key water and soil conservation areas has begun to change. Soil erosion has been effectively controlled, and the benefits of water retention, soil conservation, flood mitigation, and sediment reduction have become increasingly apparent. The harm caused by soil erosion has been significantly reduced, and the ecological environment has improved. From 1977 to 1986, the Sanchuan River Basin reduced an average of 1,719.6 million tons of sediment entering the Yellow River each year compared to the period from 1967 to 1976, with a sediment reduction rate of 58.8%. In Jiangxi Province's Xingguo County, the area affected by soil erosion has been reduced by 50.12%, and the amount of soil erosion has decreased by 54.8%.

The production conditions in the key treatment areas have significantly improved. Over the past six years, the eight key treatment areas have developed 2.08 million mu of basic farmland. Assuming an average increase of 50 kilograms of grain per mu, the annual grain production can be increased by 104 million kilograms.

In the past six years, the eight key treatment areas have planted more than 16 million mu of water and soil conservation forests and 4.9 million mu of grass. Planting grass and trees has not only improved the ecological environment but also created conditions for the development of animal husbandry. In Shanxi Province, the counties of Yanggao, Tianzhen, and Hunsuan have added 170,000 mu of pasture in six years, promoting the development of animal husbandry and increasing livestock production by 51.3 million yuan.

After six years of comprehensive treatment, the living standards of the people in the eight key treatment areas have significantly improved. The total income of the Sanchuan River Basin increased from 35.7 million yuan in 1982 to 2.5 billion yuan in 1988, a fivefold increase; per capita net income rose from 69 yuan to 373 yuan, more than tripling. The number of impoverished households in the treatment areas decreased from 606,800 in 1982 to 246,400 in 1988, and the basic food problem for the people in the treatment areas has been solved.

    全国水土保持重点治理区工程实施六年
    八个重点区生态改观
    水土流失减少　农牧业有发展
    新华社太原11月19日电（记者张怀京、叶建平）记者从正在山西省吕梁地区召开的全国八片水土保持重点治理区第六次会议上获悉：我国八片水土保持重点治理区第一期工程实施6年来，已综合治理水土流失面积1.63万平方公里，占八片重点治理区水土流失面积的26.8％，治理区生态环境初步改观，生产条件改善。
    1982年，国务院把黄河水系水土流失严重的无定河流域、三川河流域、皇甫川流域、定西县以及辽河水系的柳河流域、海河水系的永定河流域和长江葛洲坝库区、江西兴国县等八片地区，列为水土流失重点治理区。经过6年多的初步治理，八片水土保持重点治理区水土流失面貌开始改观。水土流失基本得到控制，蓄水保土、缓洪减沙的效益日见明显，水土流失危害大为减轻，生态环境改善。三川河流域1977年至1986年的10年与1967年至1976年的10年相比，在年平均汛期雨量相近的情况下，每年平均减少入黄河泥沙1719.6万吨，减沙率达到58.8％。江西省兴国县水土流失面积比重点治理前减少50.12％，水土流失量减少54.8％。
    重点治理区的生产条件大为改善。6年来，八片重点治理区共修建基本农田208万亩，以平均每亩增产粮食50公斤计算，每年可增产粮食1.04亿公斤。
    八片重点治理区还在六年中营造了1600多万亩水土保持林，种植了490万亩草，种草种树既改善了生态环境，又为养植业的发展创造了条件。山西省的阳高、天镇、浑源三县，六年新增牧草17万亩，促进了畜牧业的发展，牧业产值增加513万元。
    经过6年来的综合治理，八片重点治理区群众的生活水平都有明显的提高。三川河流域总收入由重点治理前1982年的3570万元，1988年提高到2.5亿元，增加5倍；人均纯收入由69元提高到373元，增长了3倍多。治理区内贫困户由1982年的60.68万户，下降到1988年的24.64万户，治理区内群众温饱问题基本解决。
