Xinhua News Agency, Islamabad, November 7th.

A delegation from the Afghan Mujahideen 8-Party Alliance, based in Iran, arrived in the Pakistani border city of Peshawar near Afghanistan on the 6th to hold talks with the interim government of the 7-Party Alliance.

A Mujahideen representative said on the 7th that the delegation will discuss with interim government President Sibghatullah Mojaddedi the conditions for the 8-Party Alliance to join the interim government.

The 8-Party Alliance Mujahideen are Shiites, and due to disagreements over the allocation of seats, they did not participate in the interim government announced by the 7-Party Alliance in February this year. These representatives said that the interim government is considering a proposal to accept the 8-Party Alliance.

Since the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan on February 15, the Mujahideen and the Kabul regime's military have been engaged in fierce battles. The Mujahideen have vowed to overthrow the Kabul regime and establish their own government.

    阿富汗游击队两派会谈
    讨论8党联盟参加临时政府条件
    新华社伊斯兰堡11月7日电　总部设在伊朗的阿富汗游击队8党联盟派遣一个代表团6日到达邻近阿富汗的巴基斯坦边境城市白沙瓦同阿游击队7党联盟临时政府举行会谈。
    游击队人士7日说，该代表团将同临时政府总统西卜加图拉·穆贾迪迪讨论8党联盟参加临时政府的条件。
    8党联盟游击队属于什叶派，他们由于在席位数量分配上与7党联盟存在分歧没有参加7党联盟今年2月宣布组成的临时政府。这些人士说，临时政府正在考虑一项接纳8党联盟的建议。
    自从2月15日苏联从阿全部撤军以来，阿游击队和喀布尔政权军队一直在展开激烈的战斗。游击队发誓要推翻喀布尔政权并建立自己的政府。
