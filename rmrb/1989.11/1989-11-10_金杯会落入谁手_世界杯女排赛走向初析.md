The fifth World Cup women's volleyball tournament is underway in Tokyo, and the hottest topic here is who will win the golden cup. Cuba defeated the Soviet Union in straight sets, making it seem like a match between two teams of different levels. This has significantly boosted Cuba's chances of winning the cup. Today's local newspapers have a prominent headline: "Cuba is the world's number one." The Cuban team is also open about their ambitions. Cuban star, number 15, Magaly, confidently said, "We are fully prepared to win every match." The Soviet Union's hopes of winning the cup rest on the premise that China defeats Cuba. Whether China can win the cup largely depends on the outcome of the first day's match against Cuba in Osaka.

Cuban coach Eugenio said that Cuba is confident in defeating the Soviet Union. Although the Soviet Union is the Olympic champion from Seoul, since the Olympics, Cuba and the Soviet Union have faced off six times, with Cuba winning five and losing one. The Chinese team is different; its six main players have balanced strengths, with no standout center but also no obvious weak points. Last year, Cuba lost only once to China in 76 international matches. This May, in Sichuan and Beijing, Cuba played four matches against China, winning two and losing two. The lineup at that time was the same as the one that defeated the Soviet Union yesterday. Therefore, China remains a formidable opponent, and only by defeating China can the cup be secured.

Before the Chinese women's volleyball team departed from Tokyo for Osaka, the reporter discussed the much-anticipated China-Cuba match with coaches Hu Jin and Jiang Sheng. They believe that Cuba's strengths are obvious: high jumping ability, good physical condition, powerful spikes, and aggressive serves. Their blocking and defensive techniques have also improved. The biggest weakness is emotional instability, which was exposed in the third set of their match against the Soviet Union. The Chinese team has no mental burden in playing against Cuba and aims to perform at their best. Their strategy includes two aspects: mentally overwhelming the opponent, even if they fall behind in the score, they must hold on tightly and not let Cuba get into a frenzied state. Technically, they need to improve the quality of their serves to disrupt the opponent's first pass, preventing them from organizing their best attack. Secondly, they need to strengthen their blocking. They should place their strongest blocking lineup in front of the lineup where Luis is at the 4th position. The other day, in the match against East Germany, our first lineup had Li Guojun at the 4th position. In the match against Peru, the first lineup had Wu Dan at the 4th position. Against Cuba, they need to consider the lineup to counter Luis at the 4th position and strengthen protection to reduce receiving errors.

    金杯会落入谁手
    ——世界杯女排赛走向初析
    第五届世界杯女排赛在东京角逐两轮，此间最热门的话题是世界杯落入谁手。古巴队直落3局战胜苏联，好像两个不同级别对手间的较量，使古巴队夺杯呼声陡然增高。今天当地报纸的醒目标题是：古巴实力世界第一。古巴队也毫不掩饰自己的雄心壮志。古巴队主力、15号玛加莉斯自信地说，已经做好全部取胜的准备。苏联队的夺杯希望只能寄托在中国队战胜古巴的前提下。中国队能否夺杯，无疑很大程度取决于在大阪开战第一天与古巴队的较量结果。
    古巴教练欧亨尼奥说，古巴对战胜苏联确有把握。虽然苏联队是汉城奥运会冠军，但奥运会后古巴苏联6次交手，古巴5胜1负。中国队则不同，6名主力队员实力平均，虽无突出的中心队员，但也无明显薄弱环节。去年古巴在76场国际比赛中，仅输给中国队一次。今年5月在四川和北京与中国队的四场比赛，2胜2负打成平手。当时的阵容与昨天战胜苏联队时的阵容一样。因此，中国队仍是可怕的对手，只有战胜中国队，才能说奖杯在握。
    中国女排从东京去大阪动身之前，记者与教练胡进和江申生谈起球迷们关心的中古之战。他们认为，古巴队的优点显而易见，弹跳高，体力好，扣杀凶猛，发球有攻击力。拦网和防守技术也有提高。最大的弱点是情绪容易波动。这一弱点在与苏联比赛的第三局中一度暴露出来。中国队打古巴队，思想上没有负担，争取打出自己的水平。其对策包括两个方面：精神上要压倒对方，即使在比分落后的情况下，也要死死咬住不放松，不能让古巴队出现打疯的情景。在技术上，首先要提高发球质量，破坏对方一传，使其不能顺利地组织起最佳的进攻态势。其次是加强拦网。把拦网最有力的一轮阵容摆在路易斯站在4号位的那轮阵容前。前天对民德比赛时，我们第一轮阵容是李国君打4号位。同秘鲁队比赛时，第一轮让巫丹打4号位。与古巴对阵，要着重考虑对付路易斯打4号位时的阵容，同时还要加强保护，减少接发球失误。
