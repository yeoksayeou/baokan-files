The third session of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) will be held in Vienna on November 20. Since the second session in 1987, UNIDO has faced numerous challenges, continuously striving for progress, and gradually overcoming financial crises to achieve stable development.

The primary goal of UNIDO is to provide technical assistance to promote and accelerate industrial development in developing countries, thereby contributing to the establishment of a new international economic order. Since UNIDO became a specialized agency of the United Nations in 1986, it has encountered significant challenges, including a substantial depreciation of the U.S. dollar. In 1986 and 1987 alone, UNIDO suffered exchange rate losses amounting to $23 million. Additionally, major contributing countries repeatedly delayed their dues, leading to a financial deficit, where expenditures exceeded income, and technical assistance programs and activities were significantly reduced.

As the Secretary-General, Mr. S. S. Sundaram, pointed out in his opening address at the previous session: "The efficiency and effectiveness of our organization are in serious jeopardy."

Facing the severe financial crisis, the UNIDO Secretariat, led by Secretary-General Sundaram, in close collaboration with member countries, persisted in reform and innovation, diligently seeking new sources of revenue and cutting costs. Eventually, they overcame the difficulties, achieved financial stability, and made a series of remarkable achievements: the execution of technical assistance reached $120 million in 1988, a 20% increase from the previous year; the Industrial Development Fund donations increased from $14.5 million in 1985 to $39 million in 1989; member countries' dues, which were severely overdue, have gradually returned to normal, indicating a growing trust in UNIDO; the number of industrial investment promotion projects reached 121 in 1988, totaling $414 million, four times the amount of the previous year; the quality of projects also saw significant improvements. The success rate of large-scale projects (over $1 million) in 1988 increased by 12% compared to 1987; the operational budget, which was initially estimated to have a deficit, achieved a surplus of $2.5 million through efforts.

More encouragingly, the positive momentum has continued this year. In the first half of the year, the execution of technical assistance was 15% higher than the same period last year. According to authoritative sources from UNIDO, by the end of this year, the operational budget is expected to have a surplus of nearly $10 million; in the coming years, the technical assistance amount is expected to maintain a level of $150 million per year.

UNIDO's remarkable achievements can be attributed to three main factors.

Firstly, under the overall trend of international relations shifting from confrontation to dialogue and from tension to relaxation, the spirit of consensus among member countries has become increasingly prominent. Whether in the General Conference, the Industrial Development Board, or the Program and Budget Committee, member countries strive to seek common ground while reserving differences, fully expressing their respective positions and wills, and making necessary compromises and concessions at the right time. Except for a few cases, the general practice is to avoid using voting to pass resolutions and to seek consensus through consultation. This has ensured that UNIDO's technical assistance programs and activities receive broad support and have a solid foundation for implementation.

Secondly, UNIDO has persisted in innovation, actively exploring new areas and methods of international industrial cooperation, continuously injecting new vitality into operational activities, and better meeting the needs of developing countries. For example, formulating special regional programs to promote economic and technological cooperation among developing countries; strengthening industrial investment promotion activities to facilitate the introduction of foreign capital for developing countries; collaborating with non-governmental organizations to promote industrial enterprise cooperation; establishing trust funds to increase funding sources, and more effectively and flexibly meeting the technical assistance needs of developing countries.

Thirdly, UNIDO has improved organizational management, gradually implementing organizational and personnel structure reforms, and continuously enhancing the organization's work efficiency.

The upcoming third session of UNIDO is of great significance for the organization's continued stable development and facing the challenges of the 1990s. People expect this session to achieve fruitful results and hope that UNIDO will play a more active and effective role in promoting and accelerating industrial development in developing countries in the 1990s.

    艰难开拓　稳定发展
    ——写于联合国工发三大前夕
    周国勇　张鹤
    联合国工业发展组织第三届大会即将于11月20日在维也纳举行。自1987年第二届大会以来，工发组织艰难开拓，不断进取，逐步走出财政危机，步入了稳定发展的轨道。
    工发组织的主要目标是通过提供技术援助，促进和加速发展中国家的工业发展，以有助于建立一个新的国际经济秩序。1986年工发组织改为联合国专门机构伊始，便遇到了美元大幅度贬值。仅1986、1987两年，工发组织蒙受汇率损失2300万美元；加以主要会费分摊国一再拖欠会费，造成工发组织财政一度亏空，入不敷出，技术援助方案与活动被迫大量削减。
    正如总干事夏松在上届大会开幕词中指出的：“本组织的效率与效益正处于严重的危急之中。”
    面临财政危机的严重挑战，以总干事夏松为首的工发组织秘书处，在各成员国的密切配合下，坚持改革创新，努力开源节流，终于摆脱困境，达到财政稳定，并取得了一系列引人瞩目的成绩：技术援助执行额1988年达1.2亿美元，较之上年度增长20％；工业发展基金捐助额由1985年的1450万美元增至1989年的3900万美元；工发组织成员国的会费由严重拖欠趋于正常，表明了对工发组织的信任感不断增强；工业投资促进项目1988年达121个，总额为4.14亿美元，是上年度的4倍；项目质量也有长足的改善。1988年大型项目（100万美元以上）执行成功率比1987年提高12％；业务预算原估计可能出现赤字，经过努力，盈余250万美元。
    更令人鼓舞的是，上述良好的势头今年以来仍在继续。今年上半年技术援助执行额又高于去年同期15％。据工发组织权威人士预测，到今年年底，业务预算可望有近1000万美元的盈余；在今后几年里，技术援助额将保持每年1.5亿美元的水平。
    工发组织之所以取得如此瞩目的成绩，主要有三个因素。
    其一，在国际局势从对抗转向对话、由紧张转到缓和的总趋势下，各成员国间协商一致的精神日渐突出。无论是大会、理事会还是方案预算会议，成员国都努力求同存异，既充分表达各自的立场与意愿，又适时作出必要的妥协与让步。除个别情况外，一般尽量避免采用表决的方式通过决议，力求以协商达到共识。这就使工发组织的技术援助方案与活动得到广泛的支持，实施基础较为扎实。
    其二，坚持创新，积极探索国际工业合作新领域、新方式，不断为业务活动注入新的活力，更好地适应发展中国家的需求。诸如制定区域特别方案，推动发展中国家经济、技术合作；加强工业投资促进活动，为发展中国家引进外资牵线搭桥；开展同非政府组织间的合作，促进工业企业合作；设立信托基金，增加资金来源，更有效、更灵活地满足发展中国家技术援助的要求。
    其三，改善组织管理，有步骤地推行组织和人员结构的改革，不断提高本组织的工作效率。
    即将召开的工发三大对于工发组织持续稳定发展、迎接90年代挑战具有重要意义。人们期待本届大会将取得丰硕的成果，同时也对90年代工发组织在促进和加速发展中国家工业发展方面发挥更积极、更有效的作用寄予希望。
