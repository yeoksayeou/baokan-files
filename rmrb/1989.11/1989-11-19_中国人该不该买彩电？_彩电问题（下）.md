Some departments have analyzed the situation in some foreign countries and found that before the social ownership rate of color TVs reaches 10%, the demand grows steadily. After reaching 10%, the demand surges rapidly, and after reaching 90%, it stabilizes again. Currently, China's color TV demand is in a period of rapid growth. It is predicted that the annual demand of 10 million units will continue for more than 10 years.

Some people think that color TVs are a high-consumption item, and such a strong demand is abnormal. It is said that China's current color TV penetration rate is similar to that of developed countries when their per capita national income was between $1,000 and $1,500, while China's per capita national income is only around $300.

Others disagree with this view, arguing that color TVs are not a high-consumption item in China. Their reasons are as follows:

First, color TVs are a necessity for people's cultural life. China has few cultural and entertainment activities, and color TVs have become the main entertainment tool for people. Every Chinese New Year's Eve, hundreds of millions of viewers gather around their TVs, and the whole nation celebrates together, which has become a major feature of the Chinese Spring Festival. Color TVs are also an important tool for people to learn about news and the policies of the Party and the state, and in a country that values political propaganda, color TVs have an irreplaceable role that other propaganda tools cannot match.

Second, China's consumption structure is single. In recent years, as people's living standards have improved, they naturally invest their money in durable consumer goods like color TVs. The Chinese people have a tradition of saving money to buy big-ticket items. Some people, despite their low income levels, would rather tighten their belts to buy a color TV. This is purely a personal choice.

Third, it is not appropriate to simply compare with the per capita national income of developed countries between $1,000 and $1,500, as one must consider the development of productivity and technological progress. The United States had a per capita national income of over $1,500 as early as 1950, while the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom, and France had per capita national incomes exceeding $1,000 in the early 1960s. At that time, color TVs had just emerged and were naturally expensive and had a low penetration rate. In 1954, the United States began color TV broadcasting, and it was not until 1964 that color TVs began to be popularized. The Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom, and France began color TV broadcasting in 1967, and color TVs became popular in the 1970s. Now, after decades of development, color TV production technology has become more mature and costs have been reduced. China introduced color TV production technology and established the color TV industry on this basis, so it is possible to popularize color TVs at a lower per capita national income level. Chinese consumers do not necessarily have to follow the old path of first buying a black-and-white TV and then a color TV. Those who have the means can directly purchase a color TV.

Fourth, color TVs are a key commodity for circulating currency. China's economy is a shortage economy. Although the market is currently sluggish, the several trillion yuan of purchasing power that has been accumulated still exerts tremendous pressure on the market. It should be gradually diverted, rather than becoming a flood that breaks the dam. Increasing color TV sales is one way to do this.

It is undeniable that people's tendency to conform and keep up with the Joneses has exaggerated the supply and demand situation in the color TV market. In a commodity economy, consumption is no longer just an economic behavior but also a way for people to show their social status and wealth. If others have a popular item and you don't, you will feel embarrassed. For the sake of face, you might try every means to buy such an item, even if it exceeds your economic conditions. This factor is present in the color TV craze. Under conditions of inflation, consumers, in order to preserve value, rush to buy certain scarce items, causing the demand for such items to skyrocket. In last year's buying frenzy, color TVs became a target for hoarding.

Although there are irrational factors in the demand for color TVs, the potential for color TV demand is still enormous, and the color TV market is far from saturated. China is a country with 1.1 billion people and over 200 million households. As people's living standards improve, more people will buy color TVs.

What should the color TV industry do? The urgent task is to expand sales. Color TV enterprises hope that the state will appropriately adjust relevant policies, and at the same time, each enterprise will do its best to open up the market.

Shanghai's color TV enterprises have reduced this year's production plan from 880,000 units to 650,000 units and have formed sales teams to travel around the country to promote sales. They have also adopted installment sales, agency sales, and periodic settlement methods. The Changan Machinery Factory in Sichuan has given an average discount of over 15% on Changhong brand color TVs. The Shaanxi Broadcasting and Television Equipment Factory has cooperated with insurance companies, and the Xinyi brand TVs sold come with theft and quality insurance provided by the factory. 33 color TV factories nationwide have implemented joint maintenance and strengthened after-sales service. From January to August, the country exported over 1 million color TVs, earning $140 million in foreign exchange.

The difficulties must be overcome, and the momentum must be increased. Even if the color TV market demand rebounds in the future, consumers who rush to buy color TVs like a swarm of bees, or those who buy them just because they are colored, will be hard to come by again. Consumers will become more picky about the quality, price, variety, and function of color TVs. The development of color TV technology around the world is also changing rapidly. How to improve the development level and open up domestic and international markets, the Chinese color TV industry has a long way to go.

Market sluggishness and fierce competition have increased the pressure on the color TV industry to shift from high-speed development to high-level, high-efficiency development, but they have also provided opportunities.

    中国人该不该买彩电？
    ——彩电问题（下）
    本报记者　皮树义
    有关部门分析了国外一些国家的情况后发现，彩电社会拥有量在达到10％以前，需求增长平稳，达到10％以后，需求急剧上升，到90％以后又趋缓和。我国目前彩电需求正处于急速上升时期。据预测，年需求量1000万台情况将持续10多年。
    有人认为彩电是一种高消费品，这么旺盛的需求是不正常的。据说，我国目前彩电的普及率已与发达国家人均国民收入1000至1500美元时的彩电普及率相同，而我国的人均国民收入只有300多美元。
    也有人不同意这种观点，认为彩电在中国不是高消费品，其理由是：
    第一，彩电是人民文化生活的必需品。我国文化娱乐活动较少，彩电成了人们最主要的娱乐工具。每年除夕之夜，亿万观众围坐电视机旁，举国同乐，已是中国春节一大特色。彩电也是人们了解新闻、党和国家方针政策的重要工具，在我们这个重视政治宣传的国家里，彩电有着其它宣传工具不可替代的作用。
    第二，我国消费结构单一，这几年人民生活水平提高，自然把钱投向彩电等耐用消费品。我国人民素有攒钱买大件的习惯，有些人收入水平不高，但宁可节衣缩食，也要买彩电。这完全是个人的一种选择。
    第三，不能简单地与发达国家人均国民收入1000至1500美元时相比，因为应当考虑生产力发展、技术进步因素。美国早在1950年人均国民收入就达1500多美元，联邦德国、英国、法国则在60年代初人均国民收入就已超过1000美元，而那时彩电刚刚兴起，自然是成本高、价格贵，普及率低。1954年美国开始彩电广播，直到1964年才开始彩电普及。联邦德国、英国、法国到1967年才开始彩电广播，70年代彩电普及。如今，彩电生产技术经过几十年的发展日益成熟，成本降低。中国就是在这样的基础上引进彩电生产技术、建立起彩电工业的，自然有可能在人均国民收入水平较低的情况下普及彩电。中国的消费者也不必非走先买黑白机再买彩电的老路，有条件的完全可以直接购买彩电。
    第四，彩电是回笼货币的骨干商品。我国经济是短缺型经济，目前虽然市场疲软，但结存的几千亿元的购买力对市场仍是巨大的压力。应该使它逐渐分流，而不使它成为决堤之水，增加彩电销售就是一条渠道。
    无庸讳言，人们的趋同心理、攀比心理放大了彩电市场的供求状况。商品经济条件下，消费已不再仅仅是一种经济行为，也是人们社会地位高低、财富多少的表现形式。人家有某种流行的商品，而你没有，你就会觉得丢面子。为了这个面子你就可能超越自己的经济条件而千方百计要买到这种商品。彩电热中就有这种因素。在通货膨胀条件下，消费者为了保值，更是一窝蜂地抢购某种紧缺商品，使这种商品的需求量大增。去年的抢购风中，彩电就成了抢购的目标。
    彩电的需求中虽有不合理因素，但彩电的需求潜力毕竟很大，彩电市场还远未饱和。我国是个11亿人口的大国，有2亿多个家庭，随着人民生活水平的提高，购买彩电的人会更多。
    彩电工业怎么办？当务之急是扩大销售。彩电企业希望国家适当调整有关政策，同时各显神通开辟市场。
    上海市的彩电企业将今年生产计划由88万台减为65万台，并组成推销小组赴全国各地推销，还采用了赊销、代销、定期结算方式。四川长虹机器厂将长虹牌彩电平均让利15％以上。陕西广播电视设备厂与保险公司合作，售出的如意牌电视机，由工厂为用户办理防盗和质量保险。全国33家彩电厂实行联合保修，加强售后服务。1至8月，全国出口彩电100多万台，创汇1.4亿美元。
    难关要闯，后劲更要增。即使今后彩电市场需求回升，那种一窝蜂似地抢购、那种是带彩的就往家抱的消费者，也恐难再现。消费者将对彩电的质量、价格、品种、功能挑剔起来，世界彩电技术发展更是日新月异，如何提高发展水平，开拓国内国际市场，中国彩电工业任重道远。
    市场疲软，竞争激烈，为彩电工业由高速度型发展转向高水平、高效益型发展，增加了压力，提供了机会。
