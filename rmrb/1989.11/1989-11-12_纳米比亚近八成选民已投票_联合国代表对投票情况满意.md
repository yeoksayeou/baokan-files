Nearly 80 percent of Namibia's 700,000 registered voters have cast their ballots in the first three days of the constitutional assembly elections.

According to official statistics, 124,700 people voted across the country on November 9 alone.

In the first three days, the total number of voters has reached nearly 550,000.

In the Ovamboland region, which has 248,000 voters and the highest population density, 90 percent of voters have already cast their ballots. In Kavango, Hereroland, and other regions, the voter turnout is also above 80 percent.

In the capital, Windhoek, 77.6 percent of the 105,000 registered voters have voted. Many employees took a day off or a few hours to vote.

UN Special Representative Martti Ahtisaari yesterday inspected the polling stations in the northern regions of East Caprivi, Kavango, and Ovamboland and expressed great satisfaction with the voting process.
