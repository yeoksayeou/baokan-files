The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Economic Belt has become a vibrant cooperative entity and is moving from initial cooperation to a more practical development stage.

The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Economic Belt, which connects Lianyungang and Yili as its eastern and western gateways, stretches 4,132 kilometers from east to west. It includes 89 cities, prefectures, and districts across 11 provinces and autonomous regions: Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia. It spans four major economic regions: Huaihai, Central Plains, Guanzhong, and Northwest, intersecting with the Yellow River Basin, forming the largest economic belt in the country.

Over the past two years, guided by the principle of "leveraging complementary strengths and promoting two-way opening," the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Economic Belt has engaged in information exchange, product, technology, and resource development, and financial borrowing through various channels. This has led to multi-channel, multi-level, and comprehensive cooperation. In the past year alone, some cities within the belt have mutually borrowed funds totaling over 8 billion yuan.

Looking at the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Economic Belt today, its eastern end, Lianyungang, has developed into a deep-water port capable of accommodating 50,000-ton vessels. Its western end, the northern section of the Urumqi-Alashankou railway, is just 76 kilometers away from being connected and operational.

To welcome the opening of the western port, the second Lanzhou-Xinjiang Economic Belt Fair of Famous, New, and Special Products was recently held in Lanzhou. The fair featured 30 categories and over 6,000 varieties of products, with a total value exceeding 1 billion yuan, showcasing the economic strength and reform and opening-up achievements of the cooperative entity.

    优势互补  双向开放
    陇兰经济带加快合作步伐
    本报兰州10月31日电　记者张述圣报道：陇海—兰新经济带已成为一个有旺盛生命力的联合体，并开始从初级合作走向务实发展新阶段。
    以连云港和伊犁为东西口岸而联接起来的陇海—兰新经济带，从东到西全长4132公里，包括江苏、山东、安徽、河南、陕西、山西、青海、甘肃、宁夏、新疆、内蒙古等11个省区的89个地州市、570多个县，横跨淮海、中原、关中、西北四大经济区，与黄河流域相交织，形成全国跨度最大的经济地带。
    近两年来，在“实行优势互补、推动双向开放”原则指导下，陇兰经济带通过信息交流，产品、技术、资源开发，资金拆借等多种形式，实行多渠道、多层次、全方位的联合与合作。一年来，经济带内一些城市互相拆借资金达80多亿元。
    喜看今日陇兰经济带，其东端的连云港，已发展成为能进出5万吨级货轮的深水泊位港口。其西端的北疆铁路乌苏至阿拉山口段，目前只剩76公里便可接轨通车。
    为迎接西部口岸的开通，最近又在兰州举办了陇兰经济带第二届名优新特产品展销会，参展商品30大类、6000多个品种，总值10亿余元，展示了联合体的经济实力和改革开放成果。
