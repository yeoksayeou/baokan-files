The selfless and unsung heroes of the film industry, the distribution and screening workers, were honored at the opening of the National Film Distribution and Screening Advanced Collectives and Advanced Workers Experience Exchange Meeting today.

Since the founding of the nation, China's film distribution and screening industry has made significant progress. The number of screening units has increased from 646 in 1949 to 162,000 today, covering cities, towns, islands, and border areas across the country. The number of distribution and screening workers has grown to a force of 500,000, who tirelessly and selflessly deliver films to every corner of the country, screening them for millions of viewers. Vice Minister of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, Chen Haosu, said, "The Republic should engrave their contributions in golden letters in the annals of history."

Today, 353 advanced collectives and 105 advanced workers were honored and awarded by the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television. It is understood that this is the second grand gathering of heroes on the film distribution and screening front since the founding of the nation.

Vice Secretary of the State Council, Liu Zhongde, and Vice Minister of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, Chen Haosu, congratulated the attendees and fully affirmed the great achievements of film distribution and screening over the past 40 years. Chen Haosu also reminded everyone to pay attention to the challenges ahead: the film market is shrinking, and there is some disorder in the market.

    本报北京11月1日讯　记者袁晞报道：电影界忘我奉献又默默无闻的发行放映工作者，在今日开幕的全国电影发行放映工作先进集体、先进工作者经验交流会上受到表彰。
    建国以后，我国电影发行放映事业有了很大发展，放映单位已从1949年的646个增加到今天的16.2万个，遍布全国城市乡村、海岛边疆；发行放映工作者已形成一支50万人的大军，他们不畏辛劳、无私奉献，把电影发送到四面八方，放映给亿万观众。广播电影电视部副部长陈昊苏说：“共和国应该用金色大字把他们的功劳镌刻在史册上。”
    今天在大会上受到影视部表彰和奖励的，有353个先进集体和105名先进工作者。据了解，这是建国后电影发行放映战线的第二次群英盛会。
    国务院副秘书长刘忠德和广播电影电视部副部长陈昊苏向到会代表表示祝贺，并充分肯定了40年电影发行放映的巨大成就。陈昊苏还提醒大家重视面临的困难：电影市场萎缩，市场出现一些混乱。
