The rowing and canoeing competitions for the 11th Asian Games will be held at the water sports venue in the Haizi Reservoir in Pinggu. Currently, the water sports venue is basically completed. The 2000-meter-long competition course fully meets the requirements for the Asian Games. The shore facilities, including the judges' tower, workrooms, athletes' rest rooms, and a fast-food restaurant, are all in place. The white walls, red roofs, and brown glass windows are very elegant. The land-based buildings of the venue have passed the acceptance inspection.

This year, the Beijing area experienced a severe drought, and the water storage in the Haizi Reservoir is currently only 41 million cubic meters, half of the usual amount. If Pinggu County, like in previous years, takes 40 million cubic meters of water from the reservoir to irrigate 70,000 mu of farmland, the reservoir will be dry and exposed.

Pinggu County has switched to using well water for farmland irrigation. This not only ensures that the rowing and other competitions for the Asian Games can proceed smoothly but also preserves the Jinhai Scenic Area, which takes the Haizi Reservoir as its main attraction.

Although Pinggu County's wheat irrigation this winter and next spring will be affected, the county government officials have expressed that the Asian Games are a major event for Beijing and the entire country. Although Pinggu County's agriculture will be somewhat affected and suffer losses, it is worthwhile from a broader perspective.

    亚运会水上运动场建成
    新华社北京电　（记者蔡君清、许基仁）第十一届亚运会的赛艇和皮划艇比赛将在平谷海子水库的水上运动场举行。目前，水上运动场基本建成，2000米长的比赛航道完全符合亚运会比赛的要求；岸上裁判塔、工作间、运动员休息室、冷快餐厅一应俱全，白墙红顶，茶色玻璃，十分雅致，运动场的陆上建筑已通过验收。
    今年北京地区适逢大旱，海子水库的蓄水量目前仅剩4100万立方米，是常年的一半。平谷县若像往年那样从水库取4000万立方米水灌溉70000亩农田，水库就将干涸露底。
    平谷县改用机井水灌溉农田，不仅能保证亚运会赛艇等项目比赛顺利进行，而且以海子水库为主景的金海公园风景旅游区也得以保全。
    尽管平谷县的小麦今冬明春灌水将受些影响，但平谷县政府负责人对此表示，亚运会是北京和全国的一件大事，平谷县虽然农业受些影响和损失，但从大局来看是划得来的。
