The State Council recently approved and forwarded the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation's "Opinion on Further Cleaning Up and Rectifying Various Foreign Trade Companies," requiring all regions and departments to implement it.

The "Opinion" states that all levels and types of foreign trade companies under the provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and centrally planned cities, as well as various departments under the State Council, must undergo strict cleaning up and rectification. Companies that do not meet the conditions must be strictly dissolved, merged, or have their import and export business licenses revoked according to the relevant regulations of the National Company Cleanup and Rectification Leading Group.

The "Opinion" also states that companies that do not settle foreign exchange with the Bank of China or other banks designated by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, and seriously evade foreign exchange; companies that assist foreign merchants in directly purchasing export goods or handling export business in mainland China, and assist them in evading foreign exchange; companies with the same or similar main businesses within the same department or region; companies without foreign trade conditions or lacking export channels, but mainly entrust other companies to export, must also be strictly dissolved, merged, or have their import and export business licenses revoked.

The "Opinion" provides specific regulations for the establishment of various levels and types of foreign trade companies after strict cleaning up and rectification. The business scope of the various levels and types of foreign trade companies that are retained must be re-approved.

International economic and technological cooperation companies are also included in the cleanup and rectification. Companies established without the approval of the State Council or the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation must be dissolved. Companies that have been approved by the State Council or the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, as well as companies that expand their international economic and technological cooperation business or pilot certain export commodity businesses, must also undergo cleanup and rectification according to the regulations.

The "Opinion" states that the foreign trade companies and their business scopes retained by various regions and departments after this cleanup and rectification must be reported to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation for approval. The retained foreign trade companies must present the approval certificate issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation to the industrial and commercial administrative department for registration.

The various levels and types of foreign trade companies in Hainan Province and various special economic zones must undergo cleanup and rectification according to relevant regulations and unified arrangements.

Foreign trade companies that are retained after cleanup and rectification, if found to be in violation of the above regulations, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation has the right to dissolve them, revoke their foreign trade business licenses, or adjust their business scopes.

The "Opinion" concludes by stating that, in accordance with the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council that from the State Council to various levels of government will no longer directly manage companies in the future, all levels and types of foreign trade companies and companies mainly engaged in import and export business will be uniformly managed by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and local foreign trade management departments at various levels, in accordance with national unified policies, in terms of industry or business.

An official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation pointed out that cleaning up and rectifying various foreign trade companies is an important measure to improve the foreign trade environment and rectify foreign trade order. It is aimed at promoting further opening up. In recent years, the establishment of such companies has been excessive and chaotic, leading to a scattered management and disorderly foreign trade order, which has seriously affected our foreign reputation. Foreign merchants have also expressed concerns. To rectify and improve the foreign trade environment and order, and to ensure the normal development of China's foreign trade and international economic and technological cooperation, it is necessary to strictly implement the "Opinion" approved and forwarded by the State Council.

The official said that during this cleanup and rectification, companies that are determined to be dissolved, merged, or have their import and export business licenses revoked must not sign new contracts with foreign merchants starting from the date of approval for dissolution or merger. All existing contracts must be fully executed.

    新华社北京11月10日电　国务院最近批转了经贸部《关于进一步清理整顿各类对外经济贸易公司的意见》，要求各地、各部门遵照执行。

    《意见》还说，对一些不到中国银行或国家外汇管理局指定的其他银行结汇，严重逃汇的公司；协助境外商人在内地直接收购出口商品或办理出口业务，协助其逃汇的公司；在同一部门或同一地区，凡主营业务相同或相近，重复设置的公司；无对外经营条件或缺乏外销渠道，而主要委托其他公司出口的公司等，也要坚决予以撤销、合并或取消其进出口经营权。
    《意见》对经严格清理整顿后，各级各类外贸公司的设置做出了具体规定；对于保留下来的各级各类外贸公司的业务经营范围，都要重新核定。
      国际经济技术合作公司也在清理整顿之列。未经国务院或经贸部批准设立的国际经济技术合作公司一律撤销。对已经国务院或经贸部批准的国际经济技术合作公司，以及扩大对外经济技术合作业务或试点经营某些出口商品业务的国际经济技术合作公司，也要按照规定
  进行清理整顿。
      《意见》指出，各地方、各部门经
  过这次清理整顿以后保留的对外经贸公司及其经营范围，报经贸部审批。审定保留的对外经贸公司，凭经贸部颁发的审定证书报工商行政管理部门核准，办理注册登记手续。
    海南省及各经济特区的各级各类对外经贸公司，按照有关规定和统一部署进行清理整顿。
    经过清理整顿后保留下来的对外经贸公司，如发现有不符合上述规定的，经贸部有权撤销，或取消其对外经营权，或调整其经营范围。
    《意见》最后说，根据中共中央、国务院有关从国务院到各级政府今后原则上不再直接管理公司的决定，各级各类对外经贸公司和主要经营进出口业务的公司，统一归口由经贸部及各级地方对外经贸主管部门按照国家统一政策，从行业或业务上进行领导和管理。
    经贸部负责人指出，清理整顿各类对外经贸公司，是治理外贸环境、整顿外贸秩序的一项重要措施，是为了更好地促进对外开放。近几年来，新成立的这类公司过多过滥，经营过于分散，外贸秩序比较混乱，严重影响对外信誉，外商也有反映。为了治理整顿好对外贸易环境和秩序，保证我国的对外贸易正常发展和国际经济技术合作的正常开展，必须按照国务院批转的《意见》，认真清理整顿。
    这位负责人说，在这次清理整顿中，被确定撤销、合并或取消进出口经营权的公司，从核准撤并之日起，不得与境外商人签订新的合同，原已签的各项合同，都必须执行完毕。
