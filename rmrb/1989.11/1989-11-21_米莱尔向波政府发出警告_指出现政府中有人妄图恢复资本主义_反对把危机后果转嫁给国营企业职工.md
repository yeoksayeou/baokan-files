Miler Warns Polish Government

Points Out Some in Current Government Attempt to Restore Capitalism

Opposes Shifting Crisis Consequences to State Enterprise Workers

Polish United Workers' Party Central Political Bureau member and Central Committee secretary Miler recently emphasized in an issue of "Political Weekly" that the United Workers' Party supports the activities of the Mazowiecki government, but "if this government shifts the heavy burden of the crisis and the consequences of hyperinflation onto the workers of state-owned and cooperative enterprises, then we will oppose it."

This Polish party leader explained that in dealing with the government led by Solidarity, the United Workers' Party adheres to the principle of "defending Poland's national interests." He said that currently, there are people in the government who are attempting to restore capitalism in Poland, and the United Workers' Party will strive to prevent this situation from developing.

    米莱尔向波政府发出警告
　　指出现政府中有人妄图恢复资本主义
　　反对把危机后果转嫁给国营企业职工
    新华社华沙11月19日电　波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员、中央书记米莱尔在最近一期《政治周刊》上强调指出，统一工人党支持马佐维耶茨基政府的活动，但“如果这个政府把危机的重负和超级通货膨胀的后果转嫁在国营和合作化企业职工的身上，那末我们就反对”。
    这位波党领导人解释说，在对待团结工会领导的政府态度上，统一工人党遵循的原则是“维护波兰国家的利益”。他说，现在政府中有人妄图在波兰恢复资本主义，统一工人党将努力防止这种事态的发展。
