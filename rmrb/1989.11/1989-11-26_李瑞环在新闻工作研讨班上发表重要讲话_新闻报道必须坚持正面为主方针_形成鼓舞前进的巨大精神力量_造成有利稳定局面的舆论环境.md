Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 25th.

Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a lengthy speech titled "Adhering to the Guideline of Positive Propaganda" at the national seminar for editors-in-chief of provincial, municipal, and autonomous region party newspapers. He emphasized that the key issue in improving news work at present is to adhere to the guideline of positive propaganda in news reporting. He believes this is an extremely important guiding principle that the socialist news industry must follow. Adhering to this guideline means accurately and timely propagating the Party's line, principles, and policies, reflecting the mainstream of social reality in an objective manner, and letting the people educate themselves through their achievements in creating a new life. This will form a great spiritual force to encourage people to move forward and create a favorable public opinion environment for stabilizing the situation.

Wang Renzhi, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, presided over the meeting. Relevant department heads Gao Di, Zhu Muzhi, Liu Zhongde, Mu Qing, and Ai Zhisheng attended the meeting.

Li Ruihuan first mentioned that to achieve the tasks proposed by the Fourth and Fifth Plenary Sessions of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the most pressing issue at present is stability. How to, through hard work, fully utilize our political advantages to stabilize the economy, politics, and society, and to achieve the goals of rectification and reform while consolidating the achievements of reform and opening up, urgently requires close coordination with news propaganda. How news propaganda can follow the spirit of the Central Committee to do a good job, be beneficial to stability, and boost morale, only help and not cause trouble, is indeed a major issue that deserves attention and study.

Li Ruihuan then elaborated on why we should adhere to the guideline of positive propaganda from the perspectives of summarizing historical experience, enhancing the party nature of news propaganda, singing the praises of the people's heroic deeds, and paying attention to the guiding role of public opinion.

Adhering to Positive Propaganda is a Successful Experience

He said that adhering to positive propaganda is a successful experience in the healthy development of the news industry led by our Party. In the early 1950s, the propaganda about the great, glorious, and correct history of the Chinese Communist Party over thirty years, the patriotic propaganda of supporting the Korean War and defending the country, the large-scale planned economic construction propaganda, and the propaganda about heroes such as Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Qiu Shaoyun, as well as labor models such as Meng Tai, Ma Hengchang, Li Shunda, Hao Jianxiu, and Wang Chonglun; in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the propaganda about the achievements of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country and the construction of the ten major buildings in Beijing; in the mid-1960s, the propaganda about the creation history of the Daqing Oil Field, the spirit of the Iron Man Wang Jinxi, the spirit of Lei Feng, and the deeds of Jiao Yulu, and since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the propaganda about economic construction and reform and opening up, all of these have played a great inspiring role in the Chinese people and have positively promoted the cause of socialist construction in China.

To Enhance the Party Nature of News Propaganda

He said that looking at the situation this year, it can be said that our news front has both successful experiences and painful lessons. During the turmoil in the spring and summer, some comrades in the news industry deviated from the Party and the people's stance, almost to the point of confusing right and wrong and not distinguishing between friends and enemies. Some publications played a role in inciting the turmoil and the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing. It can be said that the lessons learned by the news industry during this period are quite profound. After the Fourth Plenary Session, due to the series of major measures taken by the Central Committee and local authorities, the entire news front has undergone a pleasant change. In exposing the truth about the counter-revolutionary riot, opposing bourgeois liberalization, propagating the great achievements of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the country, propagating clean governance, propagating the strengthening and improvement of ideological and political work, and carrying out the "anti-pornography" campaign, the comrades in the news industry have done a lot of work and achieved good results. The news opinion has played a good role in promoting the stabilization of the situation.

Li Ruihuan emphasized in his speech the need to enhance the party nature of news propaganda. He said that we often say that newspapers should be the ears, eyes, mouth, and throat of the Party, government, and people, which is a vivid, image-based, and scientific expression of the party nature of news work. He said that our news industry is the Party's news industry, the news industry of a socialist country, and the party nature of news is unified with the people's nature of news. The Party's purpose is to serve the people wholeheartedly, and apart from the interests of the people, the Party has no private interests. The Party is the most concentrated representative of the people's interests. Therefore, the ears, eyes, mouth, and throat of the Party are naturally the ears, eyes, mouth, and throat of the people.

He said that what we call "positive" and "main" is to focus on propagating and reporting things that inspire and enlighten people to develop productive forces, inspire and enlighten people to adhere to the four cardinal principles and reform and opening up, inspire and enlighten people to strengthen socialist democracy and the rule of law, inspire and enlighten people to promote socialist spiritual civilization construction, inspire and enlighten people to love the great motherland and carry forward national culture, inspire and enlighten people to safeguard national unity and ethnic unity, inspire and enlighten people to struggle for world peace and development, in short, all news opinions that inspire and enlighten people to strive for the prosperity of the country, the happiness of the people, and the progress of society are what we call positive and should be reported with effort.

To Sing the Praises of the People's Heroic Deeds

Li Ruihuan required our news reports to sing the praises of the people's heroic deeds. He said that in the past ten years, our news agencies have reported quite a bit about the achievements, experiences, and advanced individuals of the Four Modernizations and reform and opening up, but overall, it is still not enough, unable to keep up with the pace of the times, and has not formed a social opinion environment of inspiring the spirit, working hard, striving for progress, and selfless dedication. It can be said that this is a reflection of the biggest mistake pointed out by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in recent years, that is, the weakness of ideological and political work and the lack of education on hard work and self-reliance in the news work.

The reason why I emphasize adhering to the guideline of positive propaganda is to change this situation and fully reflect the great achievements of the people in the Four Modernizations and reform and opening up. Especially when we are facing temporary difficulties and many comrades lack confidence, it is even more necessary.

To Correctly Play the Guiding Role of News Opinion is Also a Need to Oppose the Reactionary Propaganda of Hostile Forces

He believes that news opinion has a rapid, extensive, and profound guiding role in people's thoughts and actions. News opinion is always influencing people's thoughts and actions. Correctly playing the guiding role of news opinion in modern social life is both a need to correctly guide the masses and a need to oppose the reactionary propaganda of hostile forces. He said that adhering to the four cardinal principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization is a long-term and important task for the news front. We emphasize the guideline of positive propaganda, which is precisely the urgent need and practical step to achieve this task. The more vivid and rich the positive propaganda is, the more powerful the resistance, exposure, and counterattack against the liberalization trend will be.

To Carry Out Criticism is a Need for Our Cause and Self-Construction

Li Ruihuan said that adhering to the guideline of positive propaganda does not mean that we do not need critical reports, do not need to carry out public opinion supervision in a real sense, do not need to pay attention to propaganda art, and do not need to pay attention to the characteristics of news work. He said that carrying out criticism is a need for the cause led by our Party and self-construction, and it is also a manifestation of our Party's confidence and strength. Of course, the weight of criticism and exposure should only be in a secondary position, and the weight of positive propaganda must be in a dominant position. He said that since the public opinion supervision of news is the supervision of the people, news workers must do their best to get down to the grassroots, root themselves among the people, and carefully experience, perceive, and reflect the voices, wishes, and demands of the people.

News Reform Must Adhere to the Socialist Direction

Li Ruihuan specially emphasized the need to continue to adhere to news reform. He said that news reform, like other reforms, is not an issue of whether to reform or not, but an issue of how to reform. It should be pointed out that this reform must adhere to the socialist direction and must be beneficial to strengthening and improving the Party's leadership over news work. We cannot use the bourgeois news view to deal with news reform, nor can we copy the news system and model of the West.

He said that the news reform that needs to be done at present can consider the following points: First, to improve the internal leadership system of news agencies. Second, to truly shift the focus of news reporting to the masses. Third, to reform the content of news propaganda, to strengthen and improve economic propaganda, scientific and technological propaganda, and the propaganda of socialist democracy and the rule of law. Fourth, to reform the form of news propaganda. News reports need to increase information, so we must write more short news, make our news shorter, shorter, and even shorter, and change the current situation of too many long articles, long speeches, special issues, and meeting reports.

To Improve the Quality of the News Team is a Strategic Task

Li Ruihuan said that in the past forty years since the founding of the country, especially in the past ten years of reform and opening up, the achievements and contributions of news work show that our news team is generally good and reliable. However, due to the rapid development of the news team in recent years, the lack of training and education, and the influence of bourgeois liberalization and unhealthy trends in society, there are also many problems in the news team. Therefore, improving the quality of the news team is a strategic task for the news front. At present, we must first continue to seriously carry out the rectification work, grasp the construction of the leading cadres of news agencies, and fill the leading positions with comrades who are politically strong and have a certain theoretical level and professional ability. We must strengthen the training of news workers. We must organize everyone to seriously study Marxist theory, strengthen vocational ethics education and cultural professional training, strictly implement news propaganda discipline, and improve their ideological and political level and news professional level through social practice and news practice.

Li Ruihuan finally emphasized that all levels of Party committees must attach great importance to and strengthen the leadership of the news industry, especially in the current situation, they should be more concerned about news work than ever before and firmly grasp the public opinion tools in their own hands.

Also attending the meeting today were comrades attending the meeting of the heads of the news departments of local television stations and the heads of the news agencies in the capital.

　　李瑞环在新闻工作研讨班上发表重要讲话
　　新闻报道必须坚持正面为主方针
　　形成鼓舞前进的巨大精神力量
　　造成有利稳定局面的舆论环境
    新华社北京11月25日电　（记者朱维新）中共中央政治局常委李瑞环今天在全国省、市、自治区党报总编辑新闻工作研讨班上，发表了题为《坚持正面宣传为主的方针》的长篇讲话。他说，当前改进新闻工作需要研究和解决的问题很多，但关键的问题是新闻报道必须坚持以正面宣传为主的方针。他认为这是社会主义新闻事业必须遵循的一条极其重要的指导方针。坚持这个方针，就是要准确、及时地宣传党的路线、方针、政策，实事求是地反映社会现实生活的主流，让人民群众用创造新生活的业绩教育自己，形成鼓舞人们前进的巨大精神力量，造成一个有利于稳定局面的舆论环境。
    中宣部部长王忍之主持会议。有关部门负责人高狄、朱穆之、刘忠德、穆青、艾知生等出席了会议。
    李瑞环同志在讲话中首先谈到，为了实现十三届四中全会、五中全会提出的任务，当前压倒一切的是稳定。如何通过努力工作，充分发挥我们的政治优势，稳定经济，稳定政治，稳定社会，在巩固改革开放成果的同时，实现治理整顿的目标，迫切需要新闻宣传的紧密配合。新闻宣传如何按照中央的精神把工作做好，做到既有利于稳定，又能够鼓劲，只能帮忙，不能添乱，确实是一个值得重视和研究的大问题。
    李瑞环同志接着从总结历史经验、增强新闻宣传的党性、讴歌人民的英雄业绩、注重舆论的导向作用等方面，阐述了为什么要坚持正面宣传为主的方针。
    坚持正面宣传为主是一条成功经验
    他说，坚持正面宣传为主是我们党领导的新闻事业健康发展的一条成功经验。50年代初，关于中国共产党三十年伟大、光荣、正确历史的宣传，抗美援朝、保家卫国的爱国主义宣传，大规模有计划的经济建设的宣传，以及关于董存瑞、黄继光、邱少云等战斗英雄的宣传和孟泰、马恒昌、李顺达、郝建秀、王崇伦等劳动模范的宣传；50年代末和60年代初，关于建国十周年成就、北京十大建筑建设的宣传；60年代中期，关于大庆油田创业史、铁人王进喜、雷锋精神和焦裕禄事迹的宣传，十一届三中全会以来对经济建设和改革开放的宣传，所有这些，都曾对我国人民发挥了巨大的鼓舞作用，对我国社会主义建设事业起到了积极的推动作用。
      要增强新闻宣传的党性。新闻的党性同人民性是统一的
    他说，再从今年的情况来看，可以说我们的新闻战线既有成功的经验，也有失败的教训。在今年春夏之交的风波中，新闻界一些同志背离了党和人民的立场，几乎到了是非混淆、敌我不分的地步。有的报刊对动乱和北京的反革命暴乱起了推波助澜的作用。可以说，这一段时间内新闻工作的教训是十分深刻的。在四中全会以后，由于中央和地方采取了一系列重大措施，整个新闻战线发生了可喜的变化。在揭露反革命暴乱真相，反对资产阶级自由化，宣传建国四十周年的巨大成就，宣传廉政建设，宣传加强和改进思想政治工作，以及开展“扫黄”斗争等方面，新闻界的同志们做了大量工作，取得了很好的效果，新闻舆论对稳定大局起到了很好的促进作用。
    李瑞环同志在讲话中强调要增强新闻宣传的党性。他说，我们常常说，报纸要做党、政府和人民的耳目喉舌，就是关于新闻工作党性的一种鲜明、形象而科学的表述。他说，我们的新闻事业是党的新闻事业，是社会主义国家的新闻事业，新闻的党性同新闻的人民性，两者是统一的。我们党的宗旨是全心全意为人民服务，除了人民的利益以外，党没有自己的私利。党是人民利益的最集中的代表者。因此，党的耳目喉舌当然是人民的耳目喉舌。
    他说，我们所说的“正面”，所说的“为主”，就是要着力宣传报道鼓舞和启迪人们发展社会生产力的东西，鼓舞和启迪人们坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放的东西，鼓舞和启迪人们加强社会主义民主和法制建设的东西，鼓舞和启迪人们推进社会主义精神文明建设的东西，鼓舞和启迪人们热爱伟大祖国和弘扬民族文化的东西，鼓舞和启迪人们维护国家统一和民族团结的东西，鼓舞和启迪人们为推动世界和平与发展而斗争的东西，总之，一切鼓舞和启迪人们为国家的富强、人民的幸福和社会的进步而奋斗的新闻舆论，都是我们所说的正面，都应当努力加以报道。
      大力讴歌人民的英雄业绩
    李瑞环同志要求我们的新闻报道要大力讴歌人民的英雄业绩。他说，近十年来，我们的新闻机构对四化建设，对改革开放的成就、经验和先进人物也作了不少报道，但是总体上说还不够充分，不能与时代的前进步伐相呼应，没有形成一种振奋精神、艰苦创业、励精图治、无私奉献的社会舆论环境。应该说，这是小平同志指出的这些年来思想政治工作薄弱、艰苦奋斗教育不够这个最大失误在新闻工作中的一种反映。
    我之所以强调坚持正面宣传为主的方针，就是为了改变这种状况，充分反映人民群众在四化建设和改革开放中的丰功伟绩。特别是在我们目前遇到暂时困难，不少同志缺乏信心的时候，就尤为必要。
      正确发挥新闻舆论导向作用也是反对敌对势力反动宣传的需要
    他认为，新闻舆论对人们的思想和行动具有迅速、广泛而深刻的导向作用。新闻舆论随时随地都在影响着人们的思想和行动。正确发挥新闻舆论在当代社会生活中的导向作用，既是正确引导人民群众的需要，也是反对敌对势力反动宣传的需要。他说，坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化，是新闻战线一项长期而重要的任务。我们强调正面宣传为主的方针，正是实现这个任务的迫切需要和实际步骤。正面宣传搞得越生动、越丰富，对自由化思潮的抵制、揭露和反击就越有力。
      开展批评是我们的事业及自身
  建设的需要
    李瑞环同志说，坚持正面宣传为主的方针，不是不要批评报道，不是不要正确实行舆论监督，不是不要讲究宣传艺术，不是不要注意新闻工作的特点。他说，开展批评，是我们党领导的事业及自身建设的需要，也是我们党有自信心、有力量的表现。当然，批评与揭露的分量只能占次要位置，并且要十分注意把握分寸，而正面宣传的分量则必须占主导地位。他说，新闻的舆论监督既然是人民的监督，新闻工作者就要千方百计地深入实际，扎根于人民群众之中，细心地体验、洞察、反映群众的呼声、愿望和要求。
  新闻改革必须坚持社会主义方向
    李瑞环同志特别强调要继续坚持新闻改革。他说，新闻改革如同其他方面的改革一样，不是要不要改的问题，而是怎样改的问题。应该指出，这种改革必须坚持社会主义方向，必须有利于加强和改善党对新闻工作的领导。不能用资产阶级新闻观对待新闻改革，也不能照搬西方的新闻体制和模式。
    他说，当前新闻改革要做好的工作可以考虑以下几点：一是要完善新闻单位内部的领导体制。二是要把新闻报道的立足点真正转移到面向群众上来。三是要改革新闻宣传内容，要加强和改进经济宣传、科学技术宣传、社会主义民主和法制的宣传。四是要改革新闻宣传形式。新闻报道要增加信息量，就必须多写短新闻，使我们的新闻短些、短些、再短些，改变目前大块文章、长篇讲话过多，专版过多，会议报道过多的状况。
      提高新闻队伍素质是一项战略
  任务
    李瑞环同志说，建国四十年来，特别是改革开放十年来新闻工作的成就和贡献，说明我们的新闻队伍总体上是好的，可以信赖的。但是，由于近年来新闻队伍发展太快，培养教育工作没有跟上，加上资产阶级自由化及社会上不正之风的影响，新闻队伍中也存在着不少的问题。因此，提高新闻队伍素质，是新闻战线一项战略性的任务。当前，首先要继续认真搞好清查清理工作，切实抓好新闻单位领导班子的建设，把一些政治上强、有一定理论水平和业务能力的同志充实到领导岗位上来。要切实加强新闻工作人员的培训工作。要组织大家认真学习马克思主义理论，加强职业道德教育和文化业务培训，严格新闻宣传纪律，并通过社会实践和新闻实践提高他们的思想政治水平和新闻业务水平。
    李瑞环同志最后强调，各级党委必须高度重视，切实加强对新闻事业的领导，特别是在当前形势下，应该比以往任何时候更重视新闻工作，把舆论工具牢牢掌握在自己手中。
    参加今天会议的还有出席地方电视台新闻部主任会议的同志和首都新闻单位的负责同志。
