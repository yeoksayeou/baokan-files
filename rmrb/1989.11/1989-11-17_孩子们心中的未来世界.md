Who can fathom the future world in children's minds? The national "Golden Key" painting and drawing competition for children, co-sponsored by the China Women's News, the Children's Department of the All-China Women's Federation, and the Guangdong Dongguan Yawen Jewelry Co., Ltd., showcased this theme. With great interest, I participated in the evaluation of the painting section of this competition. This activity is beneficial for the development and popularization of children's aesthetic education. It is like a key that opens the door to children's wisdom. Let's take a look at the children's works! They imagine traveling to space and diving into the deep sea using various means. They want to build the world into a big garden, with skyscrapers reaching the clouds, rainbow-like overpasses and highways, transportation that can go to the sky and the earth, various future machines and robots, flowers in full bloom all year round, and various fruits growing on a single tree. They hope for a world of peace and friendship, where people of all races—black, white, and yellow—hold hands and connect hearts. The future world in the minds of preschool children has its own characteristics. They come to this kaleidoscopic world, opening their curious eyes, and are amazed by the endless mysteries. They have not yet had the chance to experience the real world, so what will the future be like? It is mostly imagination. They want to make friends with all small animals, sing and dance together, swim with frogs, and fly with birds, showcasing their pure hearts. How innocent and rich their imaginations are!

Every time I appreciate children's paintings, the organizers always thank me for my hard work. However, I always say that children's paintings make me happy, make me feel young, and give me many beneficial inspirations. This is not just polite words.

Drawing is a highly imaginative creative activity for children and is important for their overall development. Guiding children to draw should not focus on painting techniques but should emphasize cultivating their observational skills. Observation is not about precision but about broadening their horizons, making them love life, enriching their knowledge, and improving their aesthetic standards. Only by seeing and experiencing more can they generate rich associations. With rich imagination, painting can have vivid and realistic life content, personality, and aesthetic appeal. Overly rigid copying and too much emphasis on painting techniques that children may not yet understand will stifle their imagination and creativity. Even if they can draw a few things, they will lack vitality and become like little old men's paintings.

Some of the works that did not make the cut were not due to technical issues but mainly due to a lack of imagination. Although many paintings depict riding dragons and phoenixes, swinging on the moon, and rockets going to the moon, the scenes are often similar and conceptual. Such paintings are not entirely the children's own creations. This shows that we have not guided children to experience social life enough, and adults often interfere with the conceptualization and technical aspects. Let's give children the freedom to express their own imagination and use their unique methods to create!

    孩子们心中的未来世界
    杨永清
    孩子们心中的未来世界谁能捉摸呢？这次由中国妇女报社、全国妇联儿童部和广东东莞雅文首饰制品有限公司主办的全国少年儿童“金锁匙”书画大奖赛，就展示了这一主题。我怀着浓厚的兴趣，参加了这次大赛绘画方面的评选工作。这次活动，对儿童美育教育的开展并使它深入到千家万户不无益处。它好似一把打开儿童智慧之门的锁匙。请看孩子们的作品吧！他们想象以各式各样的手段遨游太空，潜入深海；他们要把世界建设成一个大花园，有摩天入云的高楼大厦，有彩虹一般的立交桥和高速公路，有上天入地的交通工具，有各式各样未来的机器和机器人，五彩缤纷的鲜花四时不谢，多种多样的蔬果长在一棵树上。他们希望世界和平友好，不管黑色人种、白色人种、黄色人种都手拉手心连心。而学龄前儿童心中的未来世界有他们自己的特色，他们来到这万花筒一般的世界，睁开好奇的双眼，目不暇接探之不尽的奥秘。现实世界还没有来得及领略，未来又是什么样子的呢？更多的还是幻想，他们想和所有的小动物交朋友，一起唱歌，一起跳舞，和青蛙一起游泳，和鸟儿一起飞翔，展示了他们纯洁的心灵。多么天真而丰富的想象啊！
    我每回品味儿童画，主办单位总要道声辛苦，然而我总是说孩子们的画使我快乐，让我感到年轻，而且给我很多有益的启示，这绝不是客套。
    画画对孩子们来说，是一种最富想象力的创造活动，对他们的全面发展有重要意义。指导儿童画画首先不在于绘画技术，而是要着重培养孩子的观察能力。观察不在精微，而重在开阔眼界，使他们热爱生活，丰富知识，提高审美水平。只有见多识广，才能产生丰富联想，有了丰富的想象力，绘画才能有生动真实的生活内容，有个性，有美的感染力。一味刻板的临摹，过多地讲求他们暂时还不好理解的绘画技术，反会束缚他们的想象力和创造精神。即使能画一两样东西，也是缺乏生气的小老头画。
    有些落选的作品，其原因很多不是绘画技术上的问题，主要是缺乏想象力。虽然好多画表现骑龙跨凤，在月亮上盈秋千，画火箭上月球等等，但画面大多雷同和概念化，这样的画看得出不全是出于儿童自己的创造。说明我们引导儿童接触社会生活不够，成人在构思上和技术上往往帮了倒忙。让我们放手让孩子们发挥自己的想象力，用自己特有的表现方法去进行创作吧！
