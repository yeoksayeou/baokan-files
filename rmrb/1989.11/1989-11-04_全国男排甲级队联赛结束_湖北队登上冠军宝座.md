The 1989 National Men's Volleyball League A Division concluded after 12 days of 11 rounds and 100 matches. The final standings were determined tonight in Nanjing.

The strong Hubei team defeated Liaoning 3:0 in the final match tonight, securing the championship with an undefeated record. The teams finishing in second to eighth place are Fujian, Liaoning, Shanghai, Nanjing Military Team, Henan, Sichuan, and Tianjin.

In today's final round, Fujian lost to Nanjing Military Team 1:3, Shanghai defeated Tianjin 3:0, and Henan won against Sichuan 3:1.

Reflecting on this league, the overall impression is that the current state of men's volleyball is not satisfactory. Firstly, this league adopted a new system, carrying over the preliminary and semifinal points to the final rankings. Although the competition was intense and tight, the overall level was not high, and the top four teams did not show significant improvement. Secondly, most teams relied heavily on veteran players, with few newcomers taking the lead. This league had 250 participants, but only about 40 were under 18 years old. These young players' individual techniques and skills are still lacking. Thirdly, the playing style is outdated, and tactics are monotonous. The previous structure of Chinese men's volleyball has been disrupted. In the past, there was a clear distinction between southern and northern styles, but now it is all about fast, agile, and varied tactics, lacking any advanced playing style, which is not a good sign.

Next year's A Division League will be divided into A, B, and C groups. The top 8 teams from this year's league will be in the A group, teams ranked 9 to 14 will be in the B group, and teams ranked 15 to 20 will be in the C group.

    全国男排甲级队联赛结束
    湖北队登上冠军宝座
    本报南京11月3日电　1989年全国男排甲级队联赛历时12天11轮100场的角逐，今晚在南京排定座次。
    劲旅湖北队在今晚最后一场比赛中，以3∶0力挫辽宁队，以全胜的战绩登上今届甲级男排联赛冠军宝座。获得二至八名的队分别是福建、辽宁、上海、南京部队队、河南、四川、天津队。
    在今天最后一轮比赛中，福建队以1∶3负于南京部队队，上海队以3∶0挫败天津队，河南队3∶1胜四川队。
    纵观本次联赛，给人的印象是男排现状难尽人意。首先是本次联赛采取新规程，将预、复决赛的小分带到排列名次上，虽然比赛激烈紧张，但水平不高，前4名的队水平提高不明显，这是其一。其二是各队普遍启用老队员，而新人挑大梁的少，本次参加队员达250人，可18岁以下的新人仅40多人，而这些队员个人技术、技巧的掌握，均有一定的差距。其三是打法落后，战术单调，以往中国男排的格局被打破了。过去分南北风格，如今却是清一色的快速、灵活多变战术，毫无先进打法，这不是件好事。
    明年甲级联赛将分A、B、C三组，今年联赛前8名为A组，9至14名为B组，15至20名为C组。
