With Power, Seek Not Private Gain; With Authority, Abuse Not
— A Record of National Labor Model and Director of Datasong Railway Bureau, Chang Guozhi

Reporters: He Guanghua, Mao Lei

On the eve of this year's National Day, Chang Guozhi, director of Datasong Railway Bureau of Beijing Railway Bureau, attended the commendation conference held in Beijing as a national labor model and participated in the National Day celebration.

Chang Guozhi, a man of robust character and abundant energy, is a typical Shandong native. He has worked in Datasong Railway Bureau for over 20 years, starting from a worker and a dispatcher.

In July 1985, at the age of 40, Chang Guozhi was appointed as the director of Datasong Railway Bureau, becoming the youngest bureau director in the national railway system at that time.

Since 1985, Datasong Railway Bureau has been consecutively named as an "Advanced Unit in Spiritual Civilization Construction" and a "Civilized Unit" by Datasong City and Beijing Railway Bureau. In 1987, it was named as a "Provincial Advanced Enterprise" by Shanxi Province. In 1988, it was awarded the collective first-class merit by the Shanxi Provincial Government on May 1st, and this year, it was again named as an "Advanced Enterprise" by Shanxi Province. Chang Guozhi himself was also selected as a labor model for Datasong City and Shanxi Province.

In Datasong Railway Bureau, when people talk about Chang Guozhi, they all praise his integrity and uprightness, especially his deeds of not seeking private gain with power and not abusing authority, which are particularly moving.

In the current situation where the supply and demand of coal are becoming increasingly prominent, some "official speculators" have emerged. Some users who are not included in the national formal plan try every means to pull strings and get vouchers to request off-contract loading. Some units without coal mines or loading points also try every means to handle coal trading business. Moreover, some retired railway workers handle car loading business for consignors.

Facing interference and impact from various aspects, Chang Guozhi remains calm and steadfast, strictly rectifying transportation discipline. He decided that the allocation of car loading in the entire bureau should shift from being closed to being open, establishing a system of publicizing car loading allocation. Since January 1st, 1986, each station of Datasong Railway Bureau has insisted on publishing the arrangement of loading plans once a month, actively accepting public supervision, increasing transparency, solving the problem of unreasonable car loading allocation, and stopping the improper practice of car loading allocation through connections and backdoors, which has been praised by consignors.

Regarding the issue of some consignors hiring retired railway workers or family members to handle car loading business at high salaries, Chang Guozhi believes this is an improper practice of seeking private gain with cars, which seriously affects the normal transportation order. Therefore, he explicitly stipulated that retired railway workers and their family members are not allowed to handle transportation business, and the transportation department is not allowed to receive them. Anyone who receives them will be dealt with as a disciplinary violation. In 1987, 46 such personnel were cleared, and in 1988, all were cleared, plugging this loophole.

Last year, under the influence of the commercial tide, some old cadres of Datasong Railway Bureau planned to set up a company with relevant units to handle the transportation of coal. Many old comrades repeatedly sought Chang Guozhi's instructions.

However, Chang Guozhi considered that the establishment of a company by old cadres does not comply with the party's policy. He talked to some old comrades, explained the pros and cons, and patiently did explanatory work. Due to his dissuasion, the company was never established. When the Party Central Committee made the decision to rectify and clean up companies, the old comrades all thought that not establishing a company was the right step and sincerely admired Chang Guozhi's high policy level.

Chang Guozhi often says, "The power in our hands is given by the Party and the people. We can only use it well for the people, and we must not abuse it."

Not long ago, a cadre wanted Chang Guozhi to say a word to get a set of housing. Chang Guozhi patiently told this cadre, "To get a house, you should find the housing allocation committee and handle it according to regulations. You can't take advantage of my position as the bureau director!"

In June of this year, the engineering department in charge of the construction of the new waiting hall of Datasong Railway Station sent someone to give Chang Guozhi a red envelope, saying, "Director Chang, you have solved many practical difficulties we encountered during construction. This 500 yuan is a reward you deserve." Chang Guozhi replied, "I won't take this money, but I appreciate your intention."

"Don't accept any gifts or rewards from others in any occasion; don't do anything against policies under my name; don't take advantage of your position to benefit from public property." These are the three rules Chang Guozhi set after taking office as the director of Datasong Railway Bureau.

The reporters learned that from January last year to now, Chang Guozhi and the bureau leaders have declined 107 invitations from consignors and cooperative units, refused 64 gifts and bonuses, and refused 4500 yuan.

After attending the National Labor Model Conference, Chang Guozhi returned to Datasong from Beijing. He is still thinking about how to improve production and transportation capacity and how to cherish the honor of being a labor model.

### 有权不谋私  掌权不滥用——记全国劳模、大同铁路分局长常国治

    有权不谋私  掌权不滥用
    ——记全国劳模、大同铁路分局长常国治
    本报记者　贺广华　毛磊
    今年国庆前夕，北京铁路局大同分局局长常国治作为全国劳动模范光荣地出席了在北京召开的表彰大会，并参加了国庆观礼。
    常国治，性格豪爽，精力充沛，典型的齐鲁汉子。从工人、调度员到分局长，他在大同铁路分局干了20多年。
    1985年7月，正当不惑之年的常国治受命出任大同铁路分局长，成为当时全国铁路系统最年轻的分局长。
    大同铁路分局从1985年起，已连续4年被大同市、北京铁路局命名为“精神文明建设先进单位”和“文明单位”，1987年被山西省命名为“省级先进企业”，1988年“五一”被山西省政府荣记集体特等功，今年“五一”又获山西省“先进企业”称号，常国治本人也分别被选为大同市、山西省劳动模范。
    在大同铁路分局，谈起常国治，人们无不称赞其两袖清风，一身正气，特别是他有权不谋私、掌权不滥用的事迹更为感人。
    在目前煤炭供需矛盾日益突出的形势下，一些“官倒”应运而生。有的没列入国家正式计划的煤炭用户，千方百计拉关系批条子，要求办理合同外装车，有的既无煤矿又无装车点的单位，也都想方设法办理煤炭经销业务，还有的铁路离退休人员为货主代办车皮业务等等。
    面对来自多方面的干扰和冲击，常国治头脑冷静，顶住压力，从严整顿运输纪律。他决定，全分局的车皮分配要从封闭走向公开，建立车皮分配张榜公布制度。从1986年元旦至今，大同铁路分局各车站，每月都坚持将装车计划安排情况公布一次，主动接受群众监督，增加透明度，解决了车皮分配不合理的问题，刹住了车皮分配拉关系、走后门的不正之风，受到货主的好评。
    对于一些货主不惜用高薪雇用铁路离退休职工或家属代办车皮业务问题，常国治认为这是一种以车谋私的不正之风，严重影响正常的运输秩序，于是明文规定铁路离退休职工和家属一律不准代办运输业务，运输部门也一律不予接待，谁接待按违纪处理。1987年清退这类人员46人，1988年全部清退，堵塞了这一漏洞。
    去年，在经商热潮的影响下，大同铁路分局一些老干部准备与有关单位联合开办发运煤炭的公司，不少老同志三番五次找常国治请示。
    但常国治考虑到，老干部成立公司，不符合党的政策。他找到一些老同志谈话，讲明利害关系，耐心地做解释工作。由于他的劝阻，公司始终没有成立。当党中央作出清理整顿公司的决定后，老同志都认为不成立公司这步棋是走对了，并由衷地佩服常国治的政策水平高。
    常国治经常讲，我们手中的权是党和人民给的，只能为人民掌好权、用好权，而绝不能滥用权。
    前不久，一位干部想让常国治给说句话，要一套住房，常国治耐心地对这位干部说：“要房子应找分房委员会，按规定办事，你可不能凭借我这分局长沾光呵！”
    今年6月，承建大同火车站新候车室施工任务的工程部门，派人专门给常国治同志送来一个红包，说是“常局长为我们解决了不少施工中遇到的实际困难，这500元钱是你应得到的一份奖金。”常国治答道：“这钱我分文不收，你们的心意我领了。”
    “不准在任何场合下接受别人送的财物礼品；不准打着我的旗号干违反政策规定的事；不准凭借职权，占公家的便宜。”这是常国治担任大同铁路分局长之后定的约法三章。
    记者了解到，去年元月至今，常国治和分局领导共谢绝了107家货主和协作单位宴请，拒收各种礼品奖金64起，拒款4500多元。
    出席了全国劳模大会，常国治从北京返回大同，他又在思虑着怎样提高生产运输能力，又在思考着如何珍惜劳动模范这一荣誉。
