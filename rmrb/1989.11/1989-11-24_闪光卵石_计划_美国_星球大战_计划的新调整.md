In the early 1980s, the Reagan administration's think tank produced the research report "High Frontier – America's National Strategy," which led to the "Strategic Defense Initiative" proposed by Reagan himself in 1983, commonly known as the Star Wars plan.

At that time, the main content of Reagan's Star Wars plan was to establish a comprehensive anti-ballistic missile defense system against the Soviet Union. That is, by the end of the century, deploy a new type of anti-ballistic missile system in space or on the ground, mainly using directed energy (lasers, particle beams, microwaves, etc.) weapons, including attack satellites and intercept missiles, to intercept and destroy incoming Soviet missiles before they reach the U.S. mainland. Although from the beginning, many enlightened individuals questioned the technical feasibility, economic affordability, and impact on the international strategic landscape of this plan, the Reagan administration still formally established the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, directly under the Secretary of Defense, in 1984, allocating $990 million that year; from 1985 to 1989, $26 billion was allocated for research work, with the original plan to complete this plan by the end of the century, costing $500 billion to $800 billion.

Six years later, the White House owner Reagan was succeeded by Bush. Bush himself, along with his Secretary of Defense Cheney and the newly appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Powell and other key military leaders, remained steadfast in their commitment to the Star Wars plan.

The Bush administration proposed a plan named "Brilliant Pebbles" this year. This plan was formulated by weapons scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. It plans to place several thousand small intercept rockets inside solar-powered inflatable packages in space, ready to destroy ballistic missiles flying through the clouds towards the United States. These thousands of rocket groups are controlled by supercomputers the size of playing cards, which can violently launch a large number of non-explosive projectiles, known as "Brilliant Pebbles," which can penetrate the thin outer shell of ballistic missiles flying at supersonic speeds.

Specifically, this "Brilliant Pebble" is a space-based intercept missile about 90 centimeters long, with a diameter of about 40 centimeters and a weight of about 40 kilograms.

Each missile in the "Brilliant Pebbles" plan is equipped with infrared sensors and computers, which can automatically track incoming missiles and guide the intercept missiles to their targets.

These "Brilliant Pebbles" are small in size and light in weight, and can be sent into orbit using launch rockets or space shuttles, deployed at an altitude of 200 kilometers.

Compared to the "fading" Star Wars plan, the "Brilliant Pebbles" plan's "brilliance" lies in: first, in terms of technology, "Brilliant Pebbles" have significantly improved the sensors, computers, guidance systems, and booster rockets compared to the original rough concept of the Star Wars plan; second, the economic cost is much lower than the Star Wars plan. U.S. Defense Department officials estimate that the cost of the interceptors in the "Brilliant Pebbles" plan is less than $500,000. The recently retired former director of the Star Wars plan, James Abrahamson, predicts that the deployment of the entire system in space will cost $25 billion.

Therefore, the Pentagon calls this space-based missile defense system in the "Brilliant Pebbles" plan "very feasible and full of vitality." Bush and Secretary of Defense Cheney have been full of praise for this plan, and have ignored various suggestions from within and outside the United States to cut the budget for the Star Wars plan (including "Brilliant Pebbles") or even cancel such plans.

According to foreign media reports, the Bush administration has decided to make the "Brilliant Pebbles" plan the first phase of the real deployment of the Star Wars plan and is preparing to submit it to Congress for review next year. If approved, the Star Wars plan, which was once popular in the early 1980s, will once again "shine" due to the adjusted "Brilliant Pebbles" plan.

This plan can be formally implemented and deployed in four to five years, and will be completed by the year 2000.

However, there are still many people inside and outside the United States who doubt the feasibility of the "Brilliant Pebbles" plan in terms of technology, economy, and international strategic relations. However, the Bush administration has already decided to implement it, which is an important new development in the U.S. space strategy and overall security strategy.

　　“闪光卵石”计划
　　——美国“星球大战”计划的新调整
　　田志立
    八十年代初期，里根政府的智囊班子提出了《高边疆——美国的国家战略》的研究报告，由此产生了一九八三年里根本人提出的“战略防御倡议”，俗称星球大战计划。
    当年里根“星球大战”计划的主要内容是：建立一整套对付苏联的反弹道导弹防御系统。即：在本世纪末以前，在空间或地面部署以定向能（激光、粒子束、微波等）武器为主，包括攻击卫星、截击导弹的新型反弹道导弹系统，以求在太空中拦截和摧毁到达美国本土之前的来袭苏联导弹。尽管从一开始许多有识之士就对该计划的技术可行性、经济承受力和对国际战略格局的影响提出了质疑，但是，里根政府还是于一九八四年正式成立了直属国防部长的战略防御计划局，当年拨款九点九亿美元；一九八五——一九八九年度拨款二百六十亿美元用于研究工作，原计划到本世纪末完成此计划，将耗资五千——八千亿美元。
    六年后，白宫主人里根已由布什接任。布什本人及其国防部长切尼和新任参谋长联席会议主席鲍威尔等军方主要将领，对“星球大战”计划仍然矢志不移。
    布什新政府今年提出一项命名为
  “闪光卵石”的计划。这一计划是由美国加利福尼亚州劳伦斯—利弗莫尔国家研究室的武器科学家制定的。它计划将把几千个小型截击火箭装入太阳能充气包内，放置于空间，以待命炸毁穿过云层飞往美国的弹道导弹。这数千个火箭群由一些纸牌大小的超级计算机控制，它能猛烈地抛出大量非爆炸射弹即“闪光卵石”，它们能射入在超高速飞行中外壳变薄的弹道导弹。
    具体地说，这种“闪光卵石”是一种长约九十厘米的天基截击导弹，其弹体直径约四十厘米，重量约为四十公斤。
  “闪光卵石”计划中的每一颗导弹内装有红外传感器和计算机，它们能够自动追踪来袭的导弹，还可以引导截击导弹的攻击目标。
    这些“闪光卵石”体积小，重量轻，可以用运载火箭或航天飞机送入轨道，部署在二百公里高空。
    与“日渐失色”的“星球大战”计划相比较，上述
  “闪光卵石”计划的“闪光”之处在于：一是在技术上，“闪光卵石”比原来粗略构想的“星球大战”计划中的传感器、计算机、制导系统和助推火箭有了重大改进；二是经济费用大大低于“星球大战”计划。美国防部官员估计，“闪光卵石”计划截击器的造价不到五十万美元。最近退休的原“星球大战”计划主任詹姆斯·亚伯拉罕森预计，“闪光卵石”计划的整个系统部署在空间需二百五十亿美元。
    因此，五角大楼称这项“闪光卵石”计划中的天基导弹防御系统“非常切实可行并具有生命力”。对此项计划，布什总统和美国防部长切尼等一直赞不绝口，对于来自美国内外各方面要求削减“星球大战”（包括
  “闪光卵石”）计划经费甚至取消这类计划的种种建议，则不予理睬。
    据外电报道，布什政府已决定将这项“闪光卵石”计划作为“星球大战”第一阶段的实战部署计划，并准备提交明年国会审议，如能得到批准，那么，在八十年代初红极一时的“星球大战”计划，又将因经过调整的“闪光卵石”计划而重新“闪光”。
  这项计划四——五年即可正式开始实施部署，十年之内
  （即二零零零年之前）将部署完毕。
    然而，在美国内外仍有不少人士怀疑“闪光卵石”计划在技术上、经济上和国际战略关系等方面的可行性。但是，布什政府现已决定实施它，这是美国外空战略和整个安全战略发展的一个重要的新动向。
