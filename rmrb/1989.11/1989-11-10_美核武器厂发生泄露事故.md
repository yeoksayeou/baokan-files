A nuclear weapons factory in the United States experienced an accident on the morning of November 8, resulting in the leakage of radioactive gases. Approximately 200 residents within a 180-acre area around the plant were forced to evacuate. The factory, located south of Dayton, Ohio, was conducting a laser experiment at the time. The windows of a building storing tritium gas shattered, leading to the gas leak.
