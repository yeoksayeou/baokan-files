This place is very old. The annals record: "This is the ancient site of the Yellow Emperor, where Cao Fu and Yu hid. Yu, due to his achievements in flood control, was enfeoffed here as the Duke of Xia." Therefore, Xia County and Xia State became the earliest names of this place. Yu's son, Qi, held a grand feast for the feudal lords here, establishing the first slave society in China. During the Spring and Autumn period, it was a secondary capital of the State of Zheng, known as Yangdi. Afterward, it experienced various dynasties. To say that our ancestors emerged from this cradle to walk towards the world and modernity is not an exaggeration.

Looking into this history, one can also know many historical figures, such as the politician and businessman Lü Buwei, the scholar Han Feizi, the general Zhang Liang, the politician Jia Yi, the painter Wu Daozi, and so on, all were born in this place.

Moreover, there is the brilliant ancient Jian porcelain, which, along with Ru, Guan, Ge, and Ding, is known as one of the five famous porcelains of ancient China, treasured by the imperial court and appreciated by the emperor, a rare treasure in the world.

However, this place is mountainous. Many farmlands are scattered like handkerchiefs on the hillsides and valleys. Relying solely on farming, as the population increased, it was difficult to even have a thin soup to drink. No wonder it once trembled and struggled for a long time, even the once proud Jian porcelain was on the verge of extinction, quietly relegated to a corner of western Henan, so poor that it was not worth mentioning.

This old county later changed its name to Yuzhou City.

In the late 1970s, when China decided to implement reform and opening up, it suddenly awakened. When it stood up from the barren yellow earth and looked around with a strange gaze, it was completely stunned: the world was like this, life could be lived in this way. It rose up, broke free from traditional shackles, and opened its arms to vigorously develop township enterprises based on resource development and traditional products. Thus, the tide of new life surged in. The wise became rich; the brave pioneered; the mediocre were satisfied; the foolish were bewildered; the cunning suffered both joy and pain; the evil were mocked by fate...

Chapter 1: Sublimation

He had just seen off a guest. Turning back from the doorway, suddenly, the power went out. The village was instantly swallowed by darkness. The dark silhouette of Wuzhu Mountain clung to the gray sky, like paper torn by a mischievous child, in disarray.

In the dim candlelight, I scanned the walls adorned with scrolls and certificates, and casually flipped through a thick book on the desk, "China Machine Tools and Tools," in both Chinese and foreign languages, constantly pondering: this Li Huizhen, if he walked into the city now, would people still recognize him as a farmer? It's not just about his suit and leather shoes, but his demeanor, his speech, his knowledge...

Nine years ago, this Xiaozhuang was famous for its poverty in the entire Fangshan Town, no, in the whole of Yuzhou. The farmland was too little, and the grain harvested was just enough for half a year. They also wanted to get rich, setting up a precast concrete factory, but the products just wouldn't sell, failing and giving the poor people a hard blow: was it so easy to do industry? At this time, Li Huizhen, who had just returned from the army, insisted on smelting corundum. Smelting this stuff required a lot of investment, just one electric arc furnace cost tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands. It also required specialized technology and specialized personnel... Something that even the state-owned enterprises in all of Yuzhou wouldn't dare to think about, how could a country bumpkin dare to do it?

I dare. This mountain has plenty of bauxite, coal, and iron filings are not a problem. At that time, electricity was available. I also heard that the county was going to build a new power plant. Corundum is a hot commodity, with high profits. As long as the quality is good, the market won't be hard to open. I did some research in several places and then decided to go into corundum...

His eyes flashed with a cunning light, perhaps with a hint of pride. This man from western Henan was rough but not reckless.

At that time, his fellow villager Chang Jianguo was running a bauxite mine. He processed raw bauxite into calcined bauxite and sold it to other places and even abroad. This business was safe. The raw materials were abundant, and the technology was not very complex. The later famous Fangshan Bauxite Mine was originally developed by Li, Chang, and others. But soon, Li Huizhen came out to lead another project to smelt corundum. He felt that just selling raw materials was not profitable, and the big profits were all taken by others.

In fact, Chang Jianguo was no ordinary person. He had been a postman, worked as an official, and was a man of vision. But at that time, he only focused on bauxite, and indeed made the bauxite mine more and more prosperous, gradually becoming one of the eight major bauxite export bases in the country. He himself was praised as the "Bauxite King" and became a well-known farmer entrepreneur nationwide.

Li Huizhen was not convinced. He wanted to do corundum, which was generally beyond the reach of township enterprises. Therefore, he was willing to endure the pain of high-temperature smelting.

In the cold and snow, eating dry bread, drinking cold water, living in a freezing tent, building the factory, mining stones... That hardship, I won't dwell on it. After all, farmers are used to hardship and fatigue. Sweating and enduring the cold have always been so.

The real difficulty was that large factories implemented technological blockades. If the technology was not up to standard, the products would not be qualified, and they couldn't be sold, owing 270,000 yuan in electricity bills in half a year... In the summer, he was so anxious that he sweated all night, unable to sleep. The torment in his heart was more intense than the scorching sun outside.

He found a technical expert through his connections. This engineer, Zhang Runxuan, from the Grinding Materials and Tools Research Institute, heard Li Huizhen's difficulties and agreed to provide technical guidance every Sunday. Li Huizhen would drive a jeep to pick him up from Zhengzhou every Saturday afternoon and send him back on Sunday afternoon. The factory was in debt and couldn't give him a red envelope, only providing three meals. But this Engineer Zhang happily traveled back and forth for seven hours every week, patiently teaching the workers and guiding them on-site, enjoying it immensely.

Qualified products came out. But buyers didn't trust them. They only trusted the few state-owned large factories. Li Huizhen carried a bag of semi-finished corundum products—brown corundum blocks—to Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhu, Xiaoshan, and other places to promote them. In the heavy rain, he delivered goods to customers, smiled, offered cigarettes, but the customers still ignored him. To build a bridge of trust was truly difficult. Proud Li Huizhen suddenly became humble Li Huizhen. He promoted brown corundum as if he were promoting himself, feeling so wronged that he wanted to cry, but still had to put on a smile. At that time, the buyer was the boss.

Now, all of this is in the past. Li Huizhen has become the boss, and the products have someone to sell. The more he produces, the more he sells. His corundum factory has been renamed "Henan West Grinding Materials and Tools Industrial Company." The products are mainly exported to Japan, West Germany, Pakistan, and the Hong Kong region, in addition to domestic sales.

What is even more worth boasting about is that this factory has also enriched a large area of villages and towns. Here, buying color TVs, tape recorders, and building new houses... have all become ordinary things. The villagers thank this Li Huizhen.

There is such an account: each ton of raw bauxite earns six yuan; smelted into calcined bauxite, it becomes 90 yuan; smelted into brown corundum, it becomes 900 yuan; crushed into corundum grains, it rises to 1350 yuan; made into resin grinding wheels, it soars to 8000 to 10000 yuan. From beginning to end, the value has increased by how many times? One thousand four or five hundred times. These are steps. Imagine: if Li Huizhen had only been content with steadily earning that six yuan? Then he would probably only be farmer Li Huizhen, not entrepreneur Li Huizhen. When the three carbon electrodes of the electric arc furnace first sparked and burned into a blazing flame in this remote village, a farmer's spiritual realm was constantly sublimated in the smelting. A new consciousness was quietly replacing another consciousness.

This change in consciousness is even more evident in the younger Chen Songqiang. This young man, after graduating from high school, worked as an office manager in Chang Jianguo's mine and then as a deputy manager in Li Huizhen's factory for a period, before starting his own business, establishing the Central Plains Industrial and Commercial Products Supply Station.

That day, I met him in the Jinhai Hotel in Zhengzhou, and indeed, he was a very capable and talkative young man.

We lay on the bed and chatted. He talked about how he broke into Guangzhou to set up a branch office. At that time, this naive young man from the north carried a 25-kilogram bag of corundum, panting and walking around the streets of Guangzhou. At first, he still put on airs, staying in hotels, taking taxis, and eating in restaurants. Seeing his wallet getting thinner and the corundum not decreasing, he changed to taking buses and eating street food. Even that seemed wasteful, so he borrowed a bicycle from a local person, visiting factories and households. He went out of Guangzhou to Jiangmen, to Xin Hui, to Hua County, to Yangjiang...

He was good at building relationships and sweet-talking. He offered a high-quality cigarette and said to people, "I'll give you a bag of corundum, please try it: if it's good, you buy it; if it's not, you throw it away, I won't take a single cent, okay?" With such confidence. He knew: my little grains of sand, don't let people know they come from Li Huizhen's township factory, but each one is top-notch, hard as diamond, comparable to the best. Compared with those large factories, they are in no way inferior.

From where did he get such energy? That day, he shook off his fatigue and actually broke into the luxurious and dizzying Flower Garden Building. On the tenth floor, he found Zheng, the deputy manager of the Foreign Economic Development Company of Guangzhou, Export Department. They had met at the Canton Fair but hadn't had the chance to talk in depth. This time, after seeing the samples, he continued to "chat" about the business of corundum, and they both hit it off, feeling they had met a kindred spirit. Later, with Zheng's guidance, he opened up the export business channel and established a supply relationship with two companies in Hong Kong...

Such a 28-year-old young man, leading 20 or so young men in their twenties and two retired old workers, started such a business in a year and a half, earning over 100 million yuan in foreign exchange for the country. In the grinding materials and tools industry, except for a few state-owned large factories nationwide, he is at the forefront. In Henan, he is at the top. If calculated by per capita foreign exchange earnings, he would probably also be at the forefront nationwide.

He has endured all kinds of hardships. Until the day before I went, he, as the manager, was still working with his subordinates to rush the cargo at the station until late at night, so that the next day when he chatted with me, his voice was hoarse, and he kept yawning.

He does business with great integrity, emphasizing quality, believing that making money is a science, and spending money is an art. Last July, he hired a lawyer to seriously sue a factory. The reason was that the other party was cheating with inferior goods. The lawsuit lasted two months, and Chen Songqiang won. But the delivery was delayed, and he had to pay compensation. He would rather do this than damage the reputation of "Central Plains." This is the mindset of a big businessman.

He loves reading, from business management to "Psychology," "On Behavior," "On Humor," and so on, he reads them all with great interest. He always feels that he hasn't had a proper university education, only a bachelor's degree in business management from a local mining school, and seems to be missing something, feeling a bit resentful.

Can you still tell that this is a young man who came from a mountain village?

From Chang Jianguo to Li Huizhen, and then to Chen Songqiang, one can find a trajectory: the closed small farmer mentality is gradually being broken, and in its place is the awakening of an open modern industrial consciousness. Of course, this transformation in township enterprises is still in a difficult and confused stage.

Chapter 2: Metamorphosis

To the north of Yuzhou City, there is a river called Yinghe. In summer and autumn, the water overflows the riverbed; in winter and spring, it dries up to a thin stream. It belongs to the Huaihe River system. If you put a small flower in the river, without wind or waves, it can enter the sea...

Everyone yearns for the vastness and immensity of the sea.

There is a farmer named Wang Xien who turned a township-run small coal mine at Sanchakou into a mine that passed the national energy department's inspection and became a model mine, on par with those famous state-owned large mines. Some people say he is foolish, saying: whether it's collective or individual mining, isn't it just digging where it's good? If you can grab a bit, that's the real benefit. Wang Xien, however, says: if you build the mine well, the workers will have a sense of security and won't be nervous, and they will work hard. If the output increases, the income will be more. If you want to do it for the long term, you have to do it this way. Wang Xien sang a beautiful "Sanchakou," and was called the "Mineral Guardian." Wang Xien's account is like this: not counting small profits but counting big profits.

In the medicine street of the city, there is an individual entrepreneur Liu Kezeng who processes medicinal materials. He does business with the principle of genuine goods and the first priority of reputation. The medicinal materials trade in Yuzhou has been very prosperous since the Ming and Qing dynasties. It is said to be related to the birth of the Medicine King Sun Simiao here, with the saying "Medicine does not work if it does not pass through Yuzhou." Now it is still one of the four major medicine cities in the country. One can imagine that how many families are engaged in the medicine business? But the medicine merchants, once they hear that it is Liu Kezeng's "Yuzhou Chinese Medicine Processing Factory," they can carry it away without having to open the packages one by one. Just like "inspection-free goods." Liu Kezeng has been cheated by others, but he never cheats others. His Chinese medicine factory thus shows strong competitiveness. His way of making money is like this: benefiting others and benefiting himself.

But there are also people who take another path.

There is such a person who took over a factory in a township, hanging a sign of "Silicon Materials Factory." Full of ambition. He demolished the original glass production line and rebuilt the furnaces. Smelting silicon iron requires an electric arc furnace; but he wanted to use oil smelting, saying it was a new technology from abroad. He invited some engineers from large factories, and they all shook their heads. A bold local engineer said it could work, so he lit the fire. As a result, after smelting for half a year, not a single piece of silicon iron was produced. Why? It is said that the temperature couldn't go up.

But during this period, he sent people everywhere to promote, attracting many buyers. They remitted tens of millions, even hundreds of millions of yuan. When the contract delivery period arrived, they waited and waited but didn't see the goods. Telegrams urged, but there was no response. They sent people, only to find out that there was no goods. But seeing the furnace still burning, they said that it would be produced by a certain month. When that month came, the people came to pick up the goods, but there was still nothing. So many people were cheated like this, it is said that there were more than 30 large and small units from nine provinces and cities.

I met five or six debt collectors in the city hotel, all looking for this factory manager.

A company from Dongyang City, Zhejiang Province, remitted 1080,000 yuan, but after half a year, it was like a stone sinking into the sea. They sent people several times to collect the debt, but the manager kept delaying, breaking his promises. Finally, they had to ask the public security and procuratorate. The police with large-brimmed hats and the prosecutors with national emblems stood sternly in front of this manager. The thin manager really got scared, and he knelt down like a stick, begging with a sobbing voice: "Please don't arrest me. I am already 60 years old, how many years can I live? If you arrest me and sentence me to death, the money is still not collected. Other debt-collecting units will also suffer. Right? Please show mercy and leave me a way out, I will work hard to earn the money and return it to you..."

It was a shameless excuse. But thinking carefully, it also made some sense. The police could only sigh and leave.

One morning, I followed the police and prosecutors from Dongyang to the factory to find this manager. After inquiring, we found out that the manager had gone to Guangzhou to sign some contract. The police smiled and said: "He's gone to cheat money again." It was nine o'clock, and the deputy manager in charge of production, Liu, had just gotten out of bed. He was familiar with the police, handed over a cigarette with sleepy eyes, and muttered: "The manager has the ability and courage, but he is too confident and stubborn, can't listen to others' advice, can't tell good from bad. If he hadn't started with silicon iron at the beginning and continued to produce glass, the situation wouldn't be so bad now..."

During the conversation, I learned that this person was also a debtor. He managed procurement in a unit in Shaanxi and went to this manager to order 800,000 yuan of silicon iron. The money was paid, naturally, the goods were also not received. They originally had a relationship. Seeing that the factory really couldn't produce silicon iron and the management was chaotic and the accounts were not clear, he stayed to work with this manager. This black and thin Liu deputy manager frowned and said: "If I don't help the manager get the production going, my 800,000 yuan will also be wasted. The unit's punishment is not to mention, I might even go to jail. Now I am forced to go into business, working with the manager. Otherwise, what can I do?" So, the debtor and the debtee stood in the same trench, sharing life and death. Isn't that strange?

I asked: "How much do you owe outside?" Liu answered: "Five or six hundred million, I guess!"

The police interjected: "Hmph, it's probably not less than 1000 million!"

I and the police walked and talked in the wide factory area of more than 100 acres. Several large workshops were quiet, the collapsed furnaces had not been rebuilt, and crows and sparrows perched on the chimneys. Against the wall were several large piles of broken glass pieces and bottles, as well as iron filings and a kind of white powder. There was still coal, about a few hundred tons. The police said, last year, coal was burned in the furnace every day. Bauxite, coal, iron filings, heavy oil, etc., after burning for a day, it was like throwing "Great Unity" notes into the furnace one by one. From August to the end of the year...

I don't understand, since silicon iron couldn't be smelted, why burn money like this? The police said: "Cheating people! When people come to the factory to order goods, seeing the furnace burning, they think silicon iron can really be smelted!"

Maybe there is this component. But I think, at the beginning, this manager probably didn't intend to cheat people, he really wanted to smelt silicon iron. It is said that once, when blowing oxygen to increase the temperature, silicon iron was about to be smelted, but the furnace couldn't withstand the high temperature and suddenly collapsed. The manager was so anxious that he cried out, wanting to jump into the furnace and perish with the unsmelted silicon iron. Fortunately, he was pulled back by everyone and came to his senses...

Debt collectors exchange information and discuss debt collection methods during meal times. Those who can collect tens of thousands or even a few million yuan are envied by others. Some debt collectors say: "Not a single cent of money was collected, but the travel expenses have already cost tens of thousands."

An abnormal mentality: all debt collectors hate this manager's cheating, but almost at the same time, they all hope he goes to cheat other people's money to pay off their own debts. Such a terrible vicious cycle. People from Wenzhou say, Wenzhou specially established a debt collection company, and customers are flocking...

There are such people who, seeing others' wallets bulging, also become red-eyed, not caring about the rules of doing business. As long as it can make money, they use any means. As a result, they carry the cross of sin.

A scholar said, the subject of reform is people, reform without people, without the modernization of people, is the loss of humanity, and it is also the loss of the subject of reform. From these successful and failed people, we can clearly see that "the modernization of people" (not "pseudo-modernization") is how important!

In the north of Yuzhou City, there are ancient kiln sites from the Tang and Song dynasties, the ancient city of Sima, and the well of Yuwang locking the dragon; at the same time, there are shops and hotels with modern interior and exterior decorations, high-end salons opened by Wenzhou girls, and even the rubber dam reservoir, which is technologically advanced nationwide. Its streets have the extremely rustic Tianjiawan and Jin Gou; there are also the elegant Shuyuan Houjie, Yushi Fangjie, and Renyi Lane; and the extremely contemporary Chinese-colored Ping'an Road and Ziyou Road...

Such a place gives birth to such people: the intertwining of tradition and modernity, the penetration of "rustic" and "foreign." When knocking on the door of the new era, it performs a series of scenes that are both sublime and heart-wrenching...

    叩响新时代之门
    宋家玲
    这个地方很老很老。志书上载：此地“乃黄帝之故墟，巢父、许由隐居之地”。禹因治水有功，在此“受封为夏伯”。故而，夏邑、夏国成了此地最早的命名。禹之子启在此“大享诸侯”，建立华夏第一个奴隶制王朝。春秋时，为郑国别都，称阳翟。之后，经历诸朝诸代。说我们的老祖宗从这个摇篮里走出，走向世界，走向现代，绝非夸大其词。
    查一查这段历史，还可知诸多历史名人，如政治家兼大商人吕不韦、大学问家韩非子、名将张良、政治家晁错、大画家吴道子……都落生在这个地方。
    何况还有那溢光流彩的古钧瓷，与汝、官、哥、定等名瓷并称中国古代五大名瓷，为宫廷专藏，为天子赏识，属世间珍罕之物。
    但是，此方山地多。许多农田，竟像一方方手帕，七零八落地晾晒在山坡上、沟谷里。只靠在地里刨食吃，随着人口的增多，自然连稀汤也难以喝上。难怪她曾在一段漫长的困顿中颤抖、挣扎，连颇以为自豪的钧瓷都濒于绝迹，只是默默地屈居豫西一隅，寒酸到不值得一提的地步。
    这个老县后来改名为禹州市。
    70年代末中国决定进行改革开放之时，她突然苏醒了。当她从贫瘠的黄土上站起身，以一种陌生的眼光茫然四顾，她全然惊呆了：世界原来是这个样子，生活原来还有这样一种过法。她奋起了，打破传统的禁锢，放开手脚，大搞以开发资源和传统产品为主的乡镇企业。于是，新生活的潮流澎湃而来。智者，发财了；勇者，开拓了；庸者，满足了；愚者，惶惶然不知所以；奸者，受着苦与乐的煎熬；恶者，正受到命运的嘲弄……
    上篇　升华
    他刚送走一个客人。从大门口转回身，蓦地，停电了。山村一下子被黑暗吞没。五旗山黑黢黢的影子贴在暗灰色的天幕上，像被顽童随意撕扯的一些纸片，凌乱不堪。
    幽幽烛光里，我扫视着墙上悬挂的锦旗、奖状，又随便翻开办公桌上放着的一本中外文对照的大部头《中国机床与工具》，心里不断琢磨：这个李怀珍，现在走到城市里，人们还能看出他是位庄稼汉吗？不仅仅是说他那一身西装革履，而是说他的气质、他的谈吐、他的见识……
    九年之前，这个下庄在全方山镇，不，在整个禹州，都穷得出了名儿。耕地太少，打下的粮食，可怜巴巴刚够半年吃。也想致富，搞了个水泥预件厂，产品愣是卖不出，失败了，给穷汉们当头一闷棍：搞工业当是那么好干的？这时，从部队退伍回来的李怀珍偏要炼金刚砂。炼这东西，投资大，光一座电弧炉就得十几万，二十几万。还得有专门的技术、专门的人才……全禹州，连国营都不敢想的事，你个乡下人咋就敢呢？
      我敢。这山里，炼金刚砂的原料铝矾土有的是，煤有的是，铁屑也不成问题。那会儿，电能供得上。还听说县里要新建发电站。金刚砂是抢手货，利润大。只要质量好，销路不难打开。我跑了好几个地方做了调查，这才决定上金刚砂……
    他的眼里闪着狡黠的光，或许还有一丝丝得意之情。这个豫西汉子，粗悍但不莽撞。
    那会儿，同庄的常建国正经营铝矾土矿。将生矾土炼成熟矾土，卖给外地，卖给外国。这营生保险。原材料充足，技术不很复杂。那个后来大名鼎鼎的方山铝矾土矿，本就是由李、常等人合伙开发起来的。但不久，李怀珍出来另外挑头干金刚砂了。他觉得光卖原料不合算，大头利润都叫别人得去了。
    实在说，常建国也非等闲之辈。他干过邮递员，当过干部，也是个有见识的人。但那时，他还只把眼光盯在矾土上，而且还真的把个矾土矿闹得越来越红火，渐渐地竟成为我国八大矾土出口基地之一。他本人被誉为“矾土大王”，成为全国知名的农民企业家。
    李怀珍不服气。他要干一般乡镇企业难以涉足的金刚砂。因之，他甘愿痛苦地受高温烧炼。
    冰天雪地，啃干馍，就凉水，住透心凉的帐篷，建厂，采石……那份苦，就不去多说了。反正，农民苦惯了，累惯了。出汗抗冻，历来如此。
    难的是，人家大厂搞技术封锁。技术不过关，炼出的东西不合格，卖不出去，半年里欠了电业局27万电费……大夏天的，急得他成宿成宿出汗，睡不着。这心里的煎熬，比外边的毒日头还厉害。
    他通过熟人关系，终于找到一位技术行家。这位磨料磨具磨削研究所的工程师张润选一听到李怀珍诉说的难处，慨然应允每个星期天去厂里做技术指导。李怀珍每周六下午弄辆吉普把他从郑州接来，星期日下午再送回去。厂里负债，无法给红包，只管三顿饭。但这位张工乐呵呵地每周往返颠簸七个钟头，悉心给工人讲课，到现场一一指点操作技术，乐此不疲。
    合格产品出来了。但买家不信任。人家信的还是国营的那几个大厂子。李怀珍背着一袋制造金刚砂的半成品——棕刚玉块，到上海、南京、芜湖、萧山一带的厂家推销。大雨天，送货上门，陪笑脸，递烟，对方还爱搭不理的。要搭成一座信任的桥梁，真难。高傲的李怀珍一下子变成低三下四的李怀珍。他推销棕刚玉，就像在推销自己，委屈得直想哭，却还要挂出一副笑意。那时，买方是大爷。
    如今，这一切都成为过去。李怀珍成了大爷，产品有人包销。产多少，销多少。他的金刚砂厂已改名为“豫西磨料磨具工业公司”。产品除内销，主要出口日本、西德、巴基斯坦等国家和香港地区。
    更值得自豪的是，这个厂还带富了一大片村镇。此地，购彩电，买收录机，盖新房……已被视为普通之举了。村民们感谢这个李怀珍。
    有这么一笔帐：每吨生矾土挣六元钱；烧成熟矾土，变成90元；炼成棕刚玉，变为900元；粉碎成金刚砂粒，升为1350元；制成树脂砂轮，飞升到8000元至10000元。由始至终，价值提高了多少倍？一千四、五百倍。这是一级级台阶。设想：李怀珍倘若只安于稳稳当当地赚那六元钱呢？那恐怕只会是农民李怀珍，而不是企业家李怀珍了。当电弧炉的三个炭棒电极第一次在这偏僻的小山村撞击出火花，并燃成炽烈的火焰时，一位庄稼汉的思想境界就在熔炼中不断升华。一种新意识在悄悄地取代另一种意识。
    这种观念意识上的变化，在更为年轻的陈松强身上，是更为明显的。这个小伙子高中毕业之后，在常建国矿上干了一段办公室主任，又在李怀珍厂里当了一个时期的副厂长，便独立门户，创办了中原工贸产品供应站。
    那天，我在郑州金海饭店见到他，果然是个挺精干、挺善谈的年轻人。
    我们倚躺在床上神聊。聊他如何打入广州设立办事处。那时，这个憨头憨脑的北方小伙子背着一袋25公斤重的金刚砂，气喘嘘嘘在羊城街头到处转悠。开始还摆谱，住饭店，叫“的士”，下馆子。看看钱袋渐瘪，金刚砂却不见减少，便改坐“巴士”，在街头吃小吃。如此还觉破费，索性向当地人借了一辆自行车，串厂走户。又出广州，奔江门，去新会，跑花县，上杨江……
    他会拉关系，嘴甜。递上一根高级烟，跟人讲，我送你一袋金刚砂，请试用：好了，你买；不好，你扔掉，我一个子儿不收，还不行吗？一副底气十足的样子。他心里有数：我这一粒一粒小砂子，别看出自李怀珍办的乡镇厂子，却都是个顶个，硬碰硬，赛金刚。和那些大厂家比过，绝不在他们之下。
    不知哪来的一股劲头，那日他抖擞精神，竟然闯入豪华的令人眼晕的花园大厦。在十层，找到广州对外经济发展公司出口一部的郑副经理。两人曾在广交会上打过交道，却未得机会深谈。这次，看了样品，又接着“侃”了一通有关金刚砂的经营业务，彼此十分投机，颇感相见恨晚。日后，由郑副经理引路，他打开了出口业务的渠道，同香港两家公司的老板建立了供销关系……
    这么一个28岁的年青人，领着20来个20多岁的小伙子和两个退休老职工，在一年半的时间里便干起了这么一番事业，为国家创汇1000多万元。就磨料磨具行业来说，除去全国屈指可数的几个国营大厂，他可是名列前茅。在河南更是荣登榜首。如按人均创汇算，在全国恐怕也是前列了。
    他可是什么苦都受了。至今抢运装货，他这个当经理的还是和手下人一起干。我去的前一天，他便和储运部的人在车站干到后半夜，以至于白日同我聊天时嗓音沙哑，且直犯困。
    他做生意，极讲信誉，讲质量，信奉赚钱是门学问，花钱是门艺术。去年7月，他请了律师同一个厂家认真地打了一场官司。原因是对方以次充好，干骗人的勾当。官司打了两个月，陈松强赢了。但交货误了时间，他得缴一笔赔偿费。宁愿如此，也得保住“中原”的信誉。这是一种做大买卖的胸怀。
    他很喜爱读书，经营管理方面的，乃至于《心理学》、《论行为》、《论幽默》等等，读来都津津有味儿。他总觉得没有正儿八经地上大学，只在地方矿校拿了个经营管理的大专文凭，似还缺了些什么，不免有点悻悻然。
    你还能看出这是位从山村小道上走出的小青年吗？
    由常建国，到李怀珍，再到陈松强，可以寻到一条轨迹：封闭的小农意识逐渐被打破，代之而起的是一种开放的现代工业意识的苏醒。当然，乡镇企业中的这个蜕变，尚处于艰难的困惑阶段。
    下篇　嬗变
    禹州市北，有条颖河。夏秋时，水漫河床；冬春时，干涸得几成细流。它属淮河水系。在河里放朵小花，无风无浪，能进入大海……
    谁都向往大海的辽阔与浩瀚。
    有个叫王西恩的农民，硬是把个乡办的三岔口小煤矿办成经国家能源部验收合格的达标矿井，和那些有名的国营大矿并驾齐驱。有人说他傻，说：集体、个体办矿，还不是哪儿好采挖哪儿？能捞一把算一把才是实惠。王西恩却说：把矿井建好了，工人有了安全感，不必提心吊胆的，才会豁出力气干活。产量提高了，收入才能多。你想长远干，就得这样。王西恩唱了一出漂亮的“三岔口”，被人称为“矿山守护神”。王西恩的帐是这样算的，不打小算盘而打大算盘。
    市里药行街有个加工药材的个体户刘克增，做买卖讲究货真价实，信誉第一。禹州的药材交易，打从明、清起就十分兴旺。大约同药王孙思邈在此诞生有关，有“药不过禹州不灵”之说。如今仍是全国四大药都之一。可以想见，做药材生意的何止百家、千家？但药贩子们一听说是刘克增办的“药都中药加工厂”出的药，可以不必一一开包看，扛起就走。犹如“免检商品”。刘克增被别人骗过，可他绝不骗别人。他的中药厂因此而显示出旺盛的竞争力。他的赚钱之道是这样走的：利人利己。
    可也有人，走的是另一条道儿。
    有这么个人，承包了一个乡里的厂，挂上硅材厂的牌子。雄心勃勃。他把原先烧制玻璃的生产线毁了，重新砌了炉子。炼硅铁，要用电弧炉；可他要用油炼，说是国外新工艺。请了一些大厂的工程师来，都摇头。有胆大的土工程师，说能行，他便点火了。结果炼了小半年，连块硅铁的影子也炼不出。何故？据说温度上不去。
    可他这期间，派人四处游说，拉了不少买主。人家把款几十万、成百万的汇来了，到了合同付货期，左等右等不见货。电报催，无音信。派人来，方知根本没货。但看看炉子还在烧，说是某月即可炼出。到了某月，来人提货，仍是没有。如此受骗上当者，据说竟达九省市大大小小30多个单位。
    我在市宾馆碰到五六家讨债者，都是找这个硅材厂厂长的。
    浙江省东阳市有家镇办工业公司汇来108万元，半年多过去了，石沉大海。几次派人来讨债，厂长一拖再拖，言而无信。最后他们不得不请公检法。戴大沿帽的警察会同戴国徽的检察官，一脸严肃地站到了这位厂长的面前。干瘦干瘦的厂长着实有点怕了，他枯柴一般地跪下来，带着哭腔哀告：你们千万别抓俺。俺都60岁的人了，还能活几年？你们抓了俺，判死罪，钱还是讨不着。别的讨钱的单位也得跟着倒霉。是不是？还是请你们高抬贵手，留俺一条路，俺拚了命也要把钱赚到，还你们……
    是赖皮话。可细想想也不无道理。警察们只得叹一口气，走了。
    一天上午，我随东阳来的警察和检察官去厂里找这个厂长。一打听，厂长去广州签什么合同了。警察一笑，说：又去骗钱了。九点多了，主管生产的刘副厂长刚起床。他和警察很熟识，睡眼惺松递过烟，便嘟嘟囔囔地说：厂长有能力，有魄力，就是太自信，太固执，听不进旁人的话，分不清忠、奸。要是一开始不上硅铁，还继续生产玻璃，情况就不会像现在这么惨……
    谈话中，我才知道，原来此公也是债主之一。他在陕西一个单位管供销，去年代表本单位向这位厂长订了80万元的硅铁。钱付了，自然也是等不着货。他们原来就有交情。见厂里根本炼不出硅铁，而且管理混乱、帐目不清，他便留下来和这位厂长一起干了。这位黑黑瘦瘦的刘副厂长愁眉苦脸地说：不帮厂长把生产搞上去，我这80万也得泡汤。单位处分先不说，恐怕还得坐牢。现在逼得我只能下海，跟厂长一块干了。不然，怎么办呢？就这样，债主与欠债者站到了同一个战壕里，同生死共患难。你说怪不？
    我问：你们欠外头多少钱？刘答：五六百万吧！
    警察从旁插言：哼，怕是1000万也不止哟！
    我和警察在占地100多亩的宽大厂区，一边走着、看着，一边谈着。几个大厂房里，静悄悄的，倒塌的炉子尚未垒起，烟囱上落着乌鸦、麻雀。靠墙处摊着几大堆碎玻璃片和酒瓶子，还有铁屑和一种白色粉末。煤，还有几百吨的样子。警察说，去年，煤每天都在炉子里烧。矾土、煤、铁屑、重油等等，一天烧下来，等于“大团结”一张接一张地往炉子里扔。从8月一直烧到年底……
    我不懂，既然炼不出硅铁，干么还要这么白白地烧掉钱？警察说：骗人呀！人家来厂里订货，一看炉子正在烧，还以为硅铁真能炼出来呢！
    也许有这个成分。可我想，当初这位厂长大约还不至于故意想骗人，他还是真要决心炼出硅铁的。听说，有一回吹氧升温，眼看硅铁要炼出来了，不想炉子耐不住高温，突然崩塌。厂长一急，竟流着泪，大喊一声，要跳进炉子，和未炼成的硅铁同归于尽。多亏众人拉住，才清醒过来……
    讨债者每日趁吃饭之机，互通情况，研讨要债办法。有能要得十万八万者，甚或二三万者，旁人便十分羡慕。有讨债者称：钱没要来一分，旅差费却已耗去万余。
    一种畸形心态：凡讨债者无不痛恨这位厂长的骗人勾当；可几乎同时，又都希望他去骗别人的钱，来还自己的债。一种多么可怕的恶性循环。温州来的人说，温州专门成立了讨债公司，雇客盈门……
    就有这样的人，见别人的钱袋鼓起来了，自己也便急红了眼，哪里还管什么做买卖的规矩？凡能来钱，不择手段。结果，自己背上了罪恶的十字架。
    一位学者说，改革的主体是人，改革离开人、离开人的现代化设计，这是人性的失落，也是改革主体的失落。从这些成功者、失败者的身上，我们不是分明能看到，“人的现代化设计”（绝不是“伪现代化设计”）是多么的重要吗？
    禹州市城北有唐宋时的古钧窑遗址、司马古城，有禹王锁蛟井；同时，这里也有内外装饰颇为现代化的商店、宾馆，温州小姐开的高级发廊，乃至在全国都数得上技术先进的橡胶坝水库。她的街巷，有土得要命的田家拐、禁沟；也有颇雅气的书院后街、御史坊街、仁义巷；还有极富中国当代色彩的和平路、自由路……
    这样一个地方就长出这么一些人：传统与现代的交织，“土”与“洋”的渗透。在叩响新时代之门时便演绎出一幕幕令人崇高也叫人痛心的活剧……
