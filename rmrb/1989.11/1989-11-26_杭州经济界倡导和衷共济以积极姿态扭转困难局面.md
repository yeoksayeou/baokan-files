Hangzhou's Economic Sector Advocates Unity and Joint Effort to Turn Around Difficult Situations with a Positive Attitude

Hangzhou, Nov. 26 (People's Daily) — Facing the severe situation in industrial production, the Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have timely established a new approach for economic and political work: vigorously advocating the spirit of "unity and joint effort." Municipal leaders have taken the lead in stepping out of their offices to visit the grassroots, understanding the concerns of enterprises, and addressing their urgent needs, gradually forming a new atmosphere of "overcoming difficulties together" in the local economic sector.

Since the third quarter of this year, due to market sluggishness and various unfavorable factors, Hangzhou's industrial production has faced significant difficulties, and negative sentiments have grown. Municipal Party Secretary Wu Renyuan and Mayor Lu Wenqiao have visited more than 100 key enterprises, communicating with factory directors and managers in a timely manner, and discussing adjustment strategies. Municipal departments and suburban counties have organized more than 1,000 officials to visit enterprises, addressing their concerns and difficulties.

— Timely grasp the pulse of enterprise thoughts, and eliminate various doubts in a targeted manner. They have revised and improved six specific policies, including the responsibility system, enterprise operational expenses, enterprise clean governance, and regulations on the establishment of enterprise party and government institutions, thereby promoting enterprise directors and managers to continue working boldly in public opinion and policy.

— While strengthening the sense of the overall situation, encourage and protect enterprises to contribute more to the country from the aspects of funds, energy, raw materials, and contract policies. According to incomplete statistics, more than 40 large and medium-sized enterprises that have completed their contract tasks have voluntarily increased their tax payments. The city has promptly encouraged and supported these enterprises, stipulating that the excess amount will not be included in next year's base number, thereby effectively mobilizing the enthusiasm of these enterprises. The municipal foreign trade system completed the export commodity procurement task 70 days ahead of schedule and continued to expand the results, maintaining a good momentum.

　　杭州经济界倡导和衷共济以积极姿态扭转困难局面
    本报杭州电　面对工业生产的严峻局面，杭州市委、市政府适时确立当前经济思想政治工作新思路：大力倡导“和衷共济、同心协力”精神。市领导带头走出机关，深入基层，想企业之所想，急企业之所急，使此间经济界逐步形成“共闯难关”的新氛围。
    今年3季度以来，由于市场疲软等诸多不利因素，杭州市的工业生产面临较大困难，消极情绪滋长。市委书记吴仁源、市长卢文舸等领导先后走访了100多家重点企业，与厂长经理及时沟通思想，共商调整对策。市级机关和郊区各县组织1000多人次的机关干部深入企业，排忧解难。
    ——及时把握企业思想脉搏，有针对性地消除各种疑虑。他们重新制订完善责任制、企业经营活动开支、企业廉政建设等6项具体政策，以及企业党政机构设置等规定，从而在舆论和政策上促使企业厂长经理继续放手大胆工作。
    ——在强化大局观念的同时，从资金、能源、原材料和承包政策等方面鼓励保护企业为国家多作贡献。据不完全统计，全市已有40多家完成承包任务较好的大中企业主动加码，增加上交利税，市里及时给予鼓励和支持，规定超交部分不升入明年基数，从而有效调动了这些企业的积极性。市外贸系统提前70天完成出口商品收购任务后，继续扩大成果，保持良好的势头。
    ——加强宏观指导，推动企业以市场为导向，调整产销结构和产品结构。　（孙建国　高海浩）
