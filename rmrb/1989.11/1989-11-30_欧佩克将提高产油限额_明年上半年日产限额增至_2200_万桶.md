The 86th Ministerial Meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) concluded tonight. The meeting decided to raise the organization's oil production quota for the first half of 1990 from the current fourth quarter's 20.5 million barrels per day to 22 million barrels per day.

The news release issued by the meeting said that this decision was made after a thorough analysis of future oil supply and demand conditions. The meeting also set the minimum reference price for OPEC oil at $18 per barrel.

This meeting began on the 25th of this month here. Oil and energy ministers from OPEC's 13 member countries, adhering to the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences, and with the shared desire to stabilize oil prices, engaged in extensive consultations and finally reached a basic consensus on the issue of OPEC's oil production quota for the first half of 1990 and the production quotas for each member country.

At this meeting, the representatives also discussed OPEC's long-term development strategy and the issue of coordinating with non-OPEC oil-producing countries to jointly stabilize the world oil market.

This meeting appointed Abdul Aziz Turk of Saudi Arabia as the chairman of the OPEC Board for 1990.

The next meeting will be held in Vienna on May 25, 1990.
