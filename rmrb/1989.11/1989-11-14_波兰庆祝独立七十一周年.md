Poland held its first nationwide unified commemoration of National Independence Day since the war on November 11, marking the 71st anniversary of its independence. Poland was partitioned three times in the 18th century, in 1772, 1793, and 1795, by Tsarist Russia, Prussia, and Austria. After generations of unyielding struggles by Polish patriots, independence was finally achieved on November 11, 1918, leading to the establishment of the bourgeois republic, the Republic of Poland. After World War II, the People's Republic of Poland was established, and the commemoration of this day was suspended. Last year, the Polish parliament passed a resolution to restore the commemoration of National Independence Day.

Polish President Jaruzelski and Prime Minister Mazowiecki attended the commemorative activities held at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw.

    波兰庆祝独立七十一周年
    波兰十一日举行了战后第一次全国一致的国家独立日纪念活动，庆祝波兰独立七十一周年。波兰在二百年前的一七七二年、一七九三年和一七九五年曾三次被沙皇俄国、普鲁士和奥地利瓜分。经过数代波兰爱国志士的不屈斗争，终于在一九一八年十一月十一日取得独立，建立了资产阶级共和国——波兰共和国。二次世界大战后，成立了波兰人民共和国，曾停止了对这一节日的纪念活动。去年波兰议会作出决议，决定恢复纪念国家独立日的活动。
    波兰总统雅鲁泽尔斯基和总理马佐维耶茨基等参加了这次在华沙无名烈士墓举行的纪念活动。
