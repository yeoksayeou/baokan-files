The state will invest 2 billion yuan this year to build and expand 27 energy projects. The new Xinhua News Agency reported from Beijing on November 22 that to strengthen the construction of the energy industry, the State Council has approved the commencement and expansion of 27 basic construction projects in the coal and electricity sectors starting from 1989.

These projects include: the first phase of the Zhundong Open-Pit Coal Mine in Inner Mongolia, the Jixian Power Plant in Tianjin, the second phase of the Shuangyashan Power Plant in Heilongjiang, the Guangzhou Pumped Storage Power Station, the Weihe Power Plant in Shaanxi, the third phase of the Jiaozuo Power Plant in Henan, the second phase of the Jiujiang Power Plant in Jiangxi, the second phase of the Third Power Plant in Harbin, the Changshu Power Plant in Jiangsu, the Shijiazhuang Thermal Power Plant, the Luling Power Plant and Kaixian Power Plant in Sichuan, the Nanjing Thermal Power Plant, the Dezhou Power Plant in Shandong, the Xi'an Western Suburb Thermal Power Plant, the Qishuyan Power Plant in Jiangsu, the 500 kV transmission and substation project from Beilun Port to Xiaoshao to Pingyu, the 500 kV transmission and substation project for the Tianzhong Bridge Hydropower Station, the 500 kV transmission and substation project from Dongfeng to Changchun to Harbin, the 500 kV transmission project for the Dayawan Nuclear Power Station in Guangdong, the first phase of the Jincheng Chengzhuang Mine in Shanxi, the Hailar Mine in Inner Mongolia, the No. 2 Mine in Yanzhou and Jining in Shandong, the fourth phase of the Junliangcheng Power Plant in Tianjin, the fifth phase of the Xingtai Power Plant in Hebei, and the self-supplied power plants in the Daqing and Shengli oil fields.

To further alleviate the tight energy supply situation, the state continues to implement a preferential policy for the energy industry. Despite significantly reducing the scale of basic construction, 2 billion yuan has been allocated to ensure the construction of new and medium-sized coal and electricity projects, of which 500 million yuan is from foreign investment. Among the 27 new and expanded projects, the total installed capacity of the power construction projects is 9,720,000 kW. Four new 500 kV transmission lines totaling 2,425 kilometers and transformers with a capacity of 925,000 kVA have been opened, with an annual coal production capacity of 28 million tons.

　　国家今年投资200亿元新建扩建27个能源项目
    新华社北京11月22日电　（记者王震杰）为加强能源基础工业建设，国务院批准从1989年开始新建及扩建27项煤炭及电力基本建设项目。
    这些项目是：内蒙古准格尔露天煤矿一期工程、天津蓟县电厂、黑龙江双鸭山电厂二期工程、广州抽水蓄能电站、陕西渭河电厂、河南焦作电厂三期工程、江西九江电厂二期工程、哈尔滨第三电厂二期工程、江苏常熟发电厂、石家庄热电厂、四川涪陵电厂和开县电厂、南京热电厂、山东德州电厂、西安西郊热电厂、江苏戚墅堰电厂、北仑港至肖绍至瓶窑50万伏输变电工程、天生桥水电站50万伏输变电工程、东丰至长春至哈尔滨50万伏输变电工程、广东大亚湾核电站50万伏送出工程、山西晋城成庄矿一期工程、内蒙古霍林河矿、山东兖州济宁二号、天津军粮城电厂四期工程、河北邢台电厂五期工程、大庆和胜利油田的自备电站。
    国家为进一步缓和能源供应紧张的状况，继续对能源工业实行倾斜政策。在大力压缩基本建设规模的情况下，依然拿出200亿元资金确保了煤炭电力新开工大中型项目的建设，其中利用外资金额为50亿元。以上27项新建扩建项目中，电力建设项目的总装机容量972万千瓦，新开工的四项50万伏输电线路2425公里、变压器容量925千伏安，原煤年产能力2800万吨。
