The book "In the Days of Martial Law" by Zheng Niangqun has been published by the People's Liberation Army Literature and Art Publishing House.

Based on extensive research, the author presents a detailed account of a life-and-death struggle, cutting through the complexities to reveal the stark realities. The book vividly depicts major scenes of suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot and provides intricate portrayals of characters and events. When the country was in peril, the martial law troops, commanded by the republic, sacrificed personal interests for the nation and its people. Some postponed their weddings, others left the hospital early, and some gave up their vacations to rush to the capital to carry out martial law duties. During their march to the capital, they faced obstacles from a small group of agitators who misled the masses. For days, they went without food or water, unable to get off the vehicles, but they persisted in doing ideological work among the people, propagating the truth, and doing good deeds for the people. Eventually, their actions won the understanding of the masses. When they arrived at designated locations such as Tiananmen Square, they were pursued and blocked by rioters. They endured humiliation, bravely faced danger, and with their blood and lives, awakened the misled masses. They composed a special song of love for the people under extraordinary circumstances.

　　《在戒严的日子里》出版
    郑念群著的《在戒严的日子里》由解放军文艺出版社出版了。
    本书作者在大量掌握材料的基础上，透过纷繁复杂的现象，详尽地把一场你死我活的斗争展现在读者面前。既有对平息反革命暴乱重大场面的描绘，又有对人物、事件的细致刻画。戒严部队官兵受命于共和国危难之际，为了国家和人民利益，他们有的推迟了婚期，有的提前出院，有的放弃休假探亲，毅然奔赴首都执行戒严任务；在向首都开进期间，遇到一小撮坏人煽动的不明真相群众的层层阻拦，他们几天吃不上饭，喝不上水，下不了车，坚持做群众的思想工作，宣传群众，为群众做好事，终于用他们的行动赢得了群众的理解；当他们开赴天安门广场等指定地点的时候，遭到了暴徒的围追堵截，他们忍辱负重，慷慨赴义，以血醒民，用他们的行动、鲜血和生命唤醒了不明真相的群众，谱写了一曲曲特殊情况下的爱民颂歌。　　　（巨通
