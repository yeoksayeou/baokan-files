Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, November 20th.

Romanian Communist Party General Secretary Nicolae Ceausescu delivered a report on the work of the RCP between the 13th and 14th Congresses and future tasks at the 14th National Congress of the RCP, which opened on November 20th.

In his report, Ceausescu discussed the achievements of Romania's socialist construction, noting that in the 45 years since liberation, Romania has overcome the backwardness caused by centuries of foreign rule, transforming itself from an agrarian country into an industrial and agricultural powerhouse with modern industry.

He stated that during the 8th Five-Year Plan (1986-1990), Romania underwent profound changes. The achievements of the first four years of this plan, along with the 1990 plan, will ensure a 40% increase in industrial output during the 8th Five-Year Plan. He emphasized that paying off foreign debts is a great achievement of Romania's policy, ending Romania's dependence on foreign financial capital.

He said that the vigorous development of Romania's productive forces, industry, and agriculture is entirely dependent on the existence of public ownership and cooperative ownership of the means of production. Only public and cooperative socialist ownership can guarantee Romania's current level of socio-economic development and the improvement of the people's material and spiritual well-being.

Ceausescu, when discussing future tasks, said that Romania will further develop its productive forces and perfect social relations, reaching new heights of progress and civilization.

Regarding party building, he mentioned that 590,000 workers joined the party between the two congresses, with approximately 66% being workers. The RCP has 59,554 branches, and there is no socio-economic unit or important department without a strong party organization. He said that strengthening the party's leadership role in society is acknowledged by all the people and is enshrined in the country's constitution, a result of an objective historical process.

He stressed the need to strengthen ideological and political work. He said that in all political education work, it is necessary to emphasize the great achievements in the creation of the new system, the transformative power of socialism, and the fact that only socialism can guarantee human progress and the realization of a more just and beautiful world under conditions of full freedom. In political education work, it is necessary to arm party members and the working people with a scientific and revolutionary worldview.

Ceausescu emphasized that the Communist Party cannot abandon its revolutionary responsibilities and cannot transfer its historical mission to other political forces. To do so would be to abandon the obligation to be a revolutionary party and to implement the program for building socialism and communism.

In discussing international issues, Ceausescu reaffirmed Romania's consistent stance on peace, disarmament, relations between countries, and the resolution of outstanding international issues.

Regarding Romania's relationship with the Warsaw Pact, he reaffirmed that Romania is determined to strengthen cooperation with the armies of socialist countries and actively participate in the activities of the Warsaw Pact until this organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are simultaneously disbanded.

In discussing the international communist movement, Ceausescu said that under the current situation, the RCP believes it is necessary to strengthen the unity, cooperation, and solidarity of all communist and workers' parties. The RCP advocates organizing meetings in various forms, including regional conferences and an international conference, to discuss the entire communist and workers' movement and issues of concern to all humanity, and to find the best ways for cooperation and unity.

　　齐奥塞斯库在罗共十四大上作报告时强调
　　加强党的领导作用
　　共产党不能放弃革命责任也不能转让给别的政治力量
    新华社布加勒斯特11月20日电　罗马尼亚共产党总书记尼·齐奥塞斯库在20日开幕的罗共14次全国代表大会上作了关于罗共在13大至14大期间的工作和今后任务的报告。
    齐奥塞斯库在报告中谈到罗马尼亚社会主义建设事业的成就时指出，解放45年来，罗克服了由于数百年的外来统治所造成的落后状况，把自己由一个落后的农业国变成了一个拥有现代化工业和欣欣向荣农业的工农业国家。
    他说，在第8个5年计划期间（1986—1990年），罗马尼亚发生了深刻的变化。本5年计划前4年取得的成绩与1990年计划一起将保证“8·5”期间工业产值增长约40％。他强调指出，还清外债是罗政策的伟大成就，结束了罗对外国垄断金融资本的依赖。
    他说，罗生产力、工业、农业的蓬勃发展完全依靠生产资料的全民所有制和合作社所有制的存在。只有全民和合作社的社会主义所有制才是把罗马尼亚提高到目前社会经济发展阶段和提高人民的物质和精神福利的保障。
    齐奥塞斯库在谈到今后的任务时说，罗马尼亚将进一步发展生产力、完善社会关系，使罗达到进步和文明的新高峰。
    他在谈到党的建设问题时说，两次代表大会之间有59万劳动者入党，其中约66％是工人，罗党共有59554个支部，没有一个社会经济单位或者重要活动部门没有强大的党组织。他说，加强党在社会中的领导作用，全体人民对此承认和被载入国家的宪法，是一个客观历史进程的结果。
    他强调要加强思想政治工作。他说，在全部政治教育工作中务必大力突出在缔造新制度的事业中所取得的伟大成就，突出社会主义的改造力量，突出社会主义才能保证人类在充分自由的条件下进步、实现更公正更美好世界这一事实。在政治教育工作中，务必以科学的、革命世界观武装党员和劳动人民。
    齐奥塞斯库强调指出，共产党不能放弃其革命责任，也不能把自己的历史使命转让给别的政治力量。如那样做的话，实际上就等于放弃作为一个革命党和实现社会主义和共产主义建设纲领的义务。
    齐奥塞斯库在谈到国际问题时重申了罗马尼亚在和平、裁军、国与国之间关系和解决国际突出问题上的一贯立场。
    在谈到罗与华约关系时，他重申，罗马尼亚决心加强同社会主义国家军队的合作，积极参与华沙条约组织的活动，直至这一组织和北大西洋公约组织同时解散为止。
    齐奥塞斯库在谈到国际共运问题时说，在当前形势下，罗党认为有必要加强所有共产党和工人党的团结、合作与一致，罗党主张以不同的形式组织会晤，包括召开地区性会议和一次国际会议，以便共同讨论整个共产主义和工人运动、全人类所关心的问题，并找到合作与团结的最佳方式。
