Half a year ago, Jièshí Township's Jūběi Village in our city was a notorious backwater village. Due to the lack of unity within the village party branch, collective management was chaotic. Bank loans and borrowed funds amounted to over 90,000 yuan, with each villager owing 200 yuan on average. The fertilizer and diesel allocated by higher authorities could not be distributed to the villagers. In 1988, no one in the village paid the state's grain and oil procurement quotas. The village's 22,000 yuan in retained earnings could not be collected. Neighborhood disputes, fights between in-laws, and sibling quarrels were rampant, and collective property was almost entirely taken. At the beginning of this year, over 80 households in Jūběi Village pooled 1,700 yuan to prepare for a collective trip to Beijing to petition. After learning of the situation, the leaders of the city's letter and visit office went to Jūběi Village to investigate and found that to change the village's backward appearance, the village leadership needed to be adjusted. The city's letter and visit office sent a deputy director and a section chief to Jūběi Village to live, eat, and work with the villagers. After more than a month of repeated investigations, with the approval of the Jièshí Township Party Committee, the original party branch secretary of Jūběi Village was removed from his post, and the village leadership was adjusted.

As soon as the new village party branch committee was established, it led the villagers to work hard on production. The village party branch committee regularly assigned tasks to party members and mobilized them to take the lead. Under the leadership of the party members, this summer, the village's grain procurement task of over 30,000 kilograms was completed in just one day, and an additional 10,000 kilograms of wheat was sold. This autumn, Jūběi Village faced an unprecedented severe drought. The Communist Party members thought of the villagers' needs and worked day and night. The 57-year-old party member Yán Zōngpíng stayed in the machine room for over 20 days, irrigating over 500 mu of land for the villagers, while his own corn and peanut fields remained unwatered. The drought caused many villages' autumn crops to fail, but Jūběi Village still achieved a bumper harvest. The party branch committee also organized party members to participate in voluntary labor, repairing streets, and cleaning up the village. The village's appearance has been greatly improved.

The city's letter and visit office, together with the village party branch, formulated village regulations and publicized the distribution of fertilizers, pesticides, housing sites, and major collective construction projects such as orchard contracts, listening to the villagers' opinions and accepting their supervision. At the same time, the village established a financial management group consisting of old party members, old cadres, and respected villagers to manage the distribution of scarce resources such as diesel and fertilizers, and to manage the collective accounts, regularly publishing them to the villagers. The village collected over 50,000 yuan in various debts in just over three months, repaying nearly half of the bank loans and external debts, and is expected to fully repay them by the end of this year. The collective property borrowed from outside for many years has also been fully recovered. Now, no one in Jūběi Village is talking about petitioning anymore.

    得知上访消息后
    半年前，我市界石乡鞠北庄村是个远近闻名的老大难单位。由于村党支部班子不团结，致使集体经营管理混乱，银行贷款和外借款达9万多元，全村人均负债200元，上级分给的奖酬化肥、柴油也无法与群众兑现，1988年全村没有人交售国家征购的粮油，村里22000元提留款收不上来，邻里婆媳弟兄打架成风，集体财物几乎被拿光。今年初，鞠北庄村80多户群众集资1700多元，准备集体进北京上访。我市信访办公室领导人得知情况后，到鞠北庄村作了调查，发现要改变这个村的落后面貌，必须调整村领导班子。市信访办公室派了一名副主任和一名科长来到了鞠北庄村，同村里的群众同吃同住同劳动。经过一个多月的反复考察，经界石乡党委研究同意，免去了鞠北庄村原党支部书记的职务，调整了村领导班子。
    新的村党支部委员会一成立，便带领群众脚踏实地搞生产。村党支部委员会定期向党员压担子，定任务，发挥党员的联户作用。在党员的带动下，今年夏季，全村3万多公斤粮食征购任务只用了一天的时间全部完成，还超卖小麦1万多公斤。今年秋季，鞠北庄村遇到了历史上没有过的特大干旱，共产党员想群众所想，急群众所需，昼夜奋战。57岁的老党员闫宗平连续20多天睡在机房，为群众浇地500多亩，而自己的玉米、花生地却一块未浇。旱灾使许多村的秋季作物绝产，而鞠北庄村仍获大丰收。党支部委员会还多次组织党员参加义务劳动，整修街道。治理了脏、乱、差，全村面貌焕然一新。
    市信访办公室的同志同村党支部一起制定了村规民约，将化肥、农药、宅基地的分配情况以及集体建设，果园承包等重大事项公布于众，听取群众意见，接受群众监督。同时，村里成立了由老党员、老干部、有威信的群众组成的理财小组，负责柴油、化肥等紧俏物资的发放和集体帐目的管理，定期向群众公布。全村只用3个多月，就收回了各种欠款5万多元，归还银行贷款和外债已近一半，预计今年底可全部还清。多年外借的集体财物也全部收回。如今，鞠北庄没有人喊着要上访了。
