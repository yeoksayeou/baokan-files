Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 31st.

The Czechoslovak Communist Party (Czechoslovak Communist Party) today published a new draft party constitution, which will be submitted for discussion by the entire party.

The new party constitution reaffirms that the Czechoslovak Communist Party will adhere to the Leninist principles of revolutionary party nature and construction, continuing to "follow the scientific worldview and revolutionary doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, which is constantly being creatively developed."

The party constitution stipulates that the "Czechoslovak Communist Party is the tested vanguard of the working class and all laborers," and that the Czechoslovak Communist Party, in its work, adheres to the revolutionary traditions of the workers' movement, inherits the values and achievements of the various peoples in past years, and cares about strengthening socialist and proletarian internationalism, socialist ownership, and the brotherly alliance of the Czech and Slovak peoples and other nationalities within the country.

The party constitution also stipulates that the Czechoslovak Communist Party implements the principle of democratic centralism in its internal work, that party leaders are elected by differential elections, and that leaders at the county level and above cannot serve more than two consecutive terms in the same position.

The party constitution also requires party members to master Marxism-Leninism, to set an example in their work, to propagate the party's policies, and to rally the masses to implement the party's policies.

The *Red Rights Newspaper* today published an editorial on this, pointing out that the main purpose of the Czechoslovak Communist Party's drafting of a new party constitution is to enable the party to adapt to the tasks of reform and democratization under new conditions, so that the party can play a more effective leading role.

The discussion of the draft party constitution will end by the end of February 1990 and will then be submitted for approval at the 18th National Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, to be held in May next year.

    新党章规定，“捷克斯洛伐克共产党是工人阶级和全体劳动者久经考验的战斗先锋队”，“捷共在工作中遵循工人运动的革命传统，继承各族人民在过去的年代中取得的价值和成果”，“关心加强社会主义和无产阶级国际主义、社会主义所有制、捷克和斯洛伐克及国内其他民族的兄弟联盟”。
    党章还规定，捷共在党内工作中实行民主集中制原则，党的领导干部实行差额选举，以及县级以上领导干部在同一职务的连续任期不得超过10年。
    党章还要求党员掌握马列主义，在工作中起模范作用，宣传党的政策并争取群众去实现党的政策。
    《红色权利报》今天就此发表社论指出，捷共制订新党章的主要目的，是使党能够适应改革和民主化新条件下的任务，使党更有效地发挥领导作用。
    新党章草案的讨论将于1990年2月底结束，然后提交明年5月举行的捷共十八大通过。
