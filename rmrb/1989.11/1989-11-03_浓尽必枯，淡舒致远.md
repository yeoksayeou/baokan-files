Title: The Intensity of Emotion Must Wane, the Subtlety of Emotion Can Last

Art and emotion share commonalities and differences.

In the wilds and humble abodes, emotions are abundant, but few people pay attention to them here. There is no need to intensify love to the point of excess, consuming it all at once in a compressed space and time. Instead, it can be like a distant ink painting, allowing the ink to slowly spread and gently unfold, revealing a natural rhythm full of profound meaning.

"When intensity wanes, it withers; when subtlety deepens, it endures." This means that excessive intensity will inevitably lead to withering, while lightness and subtlety can achieve depth. Here, "lightness" does not mean shallow; we can understand it as distant and open. This quality is indeed fitting for describing the world of emotions.

Human emotions, like the tides triggered by the silver moon, the landscapes formed by colorful clouds, and the Milky Way stretched across the star system, also have their highs and lows, intensities and subtleties, depths and shallows.

Light mist can bring a hazy beauty. If this mist becomes too thick to disperse, the beauty will disappear. Sometimes it can even turn into a disaster, causing lost travelers to stumble off a cliff.

Those with distant and subtle emotions have broad minds. When two such broad minds connect, they often form a vast world: providing fertile fields for the sowing of emotions and a beautiful stage for their dance.

Excessive intensity leads to withering, which is a waste of emotions and a pointless expenditure of spirit.

Too much intensity also brings too much fatigue, making normal "laziness" (which is inevitable for ordinary people) often mistaken for "emotional change."

    浓尽必枯，淡舒致远
    金马
    艺术与情感有相通有异趣。
    绿林野屋情思多，多在这儿的窥视少，不必将情爱调得浓浓的，在被压缩了的时空里，一下子享用完，可以像淡远的水墨画，使墨迹缓缓漫开，静静舒展，呈现出一派含蕴泰若的自然韵味。
    “浓尽必枯，浅者屡深。”说的是浓重过分必定枯竭，文轻意淡反能深切。这里的“浅”并不是指浅薄，我们不妨理解为淡远舒朗之意。用于状写情感世界的一种好素质确是恰如其分的。
    人的情感，如同银月触发的潮汐，彩云构成的景观和星系铺展的河汉一样，亦有高低、浓淡、深浅之分。
    薄雾，可招来朦胧之美。如若这雾霭一旦浓得化不开，这美便不复存在了。有时还会化为灾害，使失路的旅者误蹈悬崖。
    情思淡远者，胸怀也辽阔。两颗如此辽阔的胸怀一旦连结，往往能形成一个浩瀚的世界：使情思的播种不乏肥沃的原野，使情思的共舞不乏美丽的舞台。
    浓尽必枯，是超量的情感浪费，是无谓的精神消耗。
    情意太浓了，也太累了，使得正常的“疏懒”（这是常人所难免的），也往往被误以为是“情变”。
