Thirteen Teams Fail to Summit Mount Everest

A reporter learned today from the Tibet Autonomous Region Sports Commission's Mountaineering Department that this year, seven countries sent 13 mountaineering teams totaling over 200 athletes to attempt to climb Mount Everest from the north side, but none succeeded.

The last mountaineering team to come to Tibet this year was the Yugoslavian team. After summiting Shishapangma Peak, they returned home on November 3rd. With this, all mountaineering activities within the Tibet Autonomous Region for the year have concluded.

Out of the 22 mountaineering teams from Japan, Italy, Spain, Greece, the United States, France, Chile, Austria, Yugoslavia, China, and Hong Kong, only five teams successfully summited peaks other than Mount Everest.

The 13 teams that attempted to summit the world's highest peak all failed. Among them, two Spanish teams reached the 8,500-meter mark, achieving the best results. Officials from the Tibet Autonomous Region Sports Commission's Mountaineering Department believe that the reasons for the failure of the 13 Everest expeditions include: first, the natural conditions on the north side of Everest are unfavorable. For example, the French team had to retreat after reaching the 8,300-meter mark due to heavy snow and wind; second, the technical equipment used for climbing was inadequate, and the climbers lacked the strength to reach the summit.

    十三支队登珠峰无一成功
    新华社拉萨11月5日电　（记者王永治）记者今天从西藏自治区体委登山处获悉，今年有7个国家的13支登山队共200多名运动员从北侧攀登珠穆朗玛峰，但无一成功。
    今年来西藏的最后一支登山队是南斯拉夫登山队。他们在登上希夏邦马峰后于11月3日回国。至此，本年度在西藏自治区内的登山活动已全部结束。
    在日本、意大利、西班牙、希腊、美国、法国、智利、奥地利、南斯拉夫、中国和香港共22支登山队中，只有5个队在珠峰以外的山峰登顶成功。
    13支欲闯世界第一高峰的登山队则全告失败，其中西班牙的两支登山队都登至8500米高度，成绩最好。西藏自治区体委登山处人士认为，13支珠峰登山队失利的原因，一是珠峰北坡自然条件不利，如法国登山队在登到8300米高度时，就因风雪太大而被迫下撤；二是攀登的技术装备欠佳，登山队员无力登顶。
