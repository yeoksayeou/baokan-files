Lebanese President Orders Oren to Hand Over Power
Lebanese Cabinet Holds First Meeting and Gains Parliamentary Trust

	BEIRUT, November 27 (Xinhua) - Lebanese President Elias Hrawi told the press yesterday that under no circumstances would he allow two governments to exist on Lebanese soil. If Oren insists on holding onto power, he will resort to force to end Oren's rebellion in the eastern region within a few hours. Hrawi stated that he would disband all militias and would not allow the Lebanese army to become a militia organization. He emphasized that the relevant countries should end their illegal relations with the violators in Lebanon. Hrawi vowed to take control of the Baabda Presidential Palace, which is still occupied by Oren. He said, even if only one room remains, he will move in.

	According to some news agencies, the president will issue an order within 48 hours to remove Oren from his position as commander of the Lebanese army. Lebanon is on the brink of a military conflict, and people are closely watching the developments.

	BEIRUT, November 26 (Xinhua) - Reports from Shatoura: Lebanese Prime Minister Selim al-Hoss today convened the first cabinet meeting and submitted a government report, including a work plan and political guidelines, to the Lebanese parliamentary session. In the parliamentary vote, the al-Hoss government won the trust of the parliament with 43 votes.

	The government report confirmed that Lebanon belongs to the Arab nation, adheres to an active policy of neutrality, and establishes friendly neighborly relations with Syria. The government pledged to end Israel's occupation of southern Lebanese territory, rebuild the Lebanese army and national institutions, immediately end the state of division, and exercise sovereignty over the entire Lebanese territory. The report emphasized that Lebanon, based on the principles of mutual benefit, neutrality, and non-alignment, will establish equal relations with all countries.

	Today, Lebanese President Elias Hrawi presided over the Lebanese cabinet meeting and approved the government report draft. Eleven ministers attended the meeting, while three ministers were absent.

	There is news that the al-Hoss government is studying a decision to remove Oren from his position as commander of the Lebanese army.

	Oren currently refuses to recognize the new government and controls the eastern part of Beirut. After the new government was announced, the Arab League's three-party committee actively engaged in diplomatic activities to mediate the existing crisis.

	Meanwhile, the opposing sides are gathering troops at the border between East and West Beirut, and the atmosphere is tense.

    据一些通讯社报道，总统将在48小时内发布法令，解除奥恩的黎巴嫩军队司令的职务。黎巴嫩随时有爆发军事冲突的可能，人们正密切注视着势态的发展。
