After the failure of the First Protective War in May 1918, although Sun Yat-sen had begun to realize that the northern and southern warlords were "all alike," he still placed his hopes for the unification of China and the realization of the Three Principles of the People on Chen Jiongming, the Commander-in-Chief of the Aid-Fujian-Guangdong Army. However, Chen Jiongming, who had already become a new warlord, was secretly colluding with Zhao Hengti, the Commander-in-Chief of the Hunan Land and Water Army (Zhao later served as the Governor and Chairman of Hunan). They planned to form an alliance once the time was ripe, to imprison or sideline Sun Yat-sen, and to implement "provincial self-government," becoming a powerful force in the region.

Little did they know, in August 1921, a secret letter from Zhao Hengti to Chen Jiongming was intercepted by Chiang Kai-shek, who was then the Commander of the Second Brigade of the Guangdong Army. Chiang Kai-shek intended to present this secret letter to Sun Yat-sen but, in order to show off his extraordinary insight, he concealed the matter when he met with Sun Yat-sen. He pretended to have foresight and told Sun, "Chen Jiongming has ulterior motives and we should take immediate steps to remove his military power." Because Chiang Kai-shek concealed the secret letter that could have proven Chen Jiongming's potential rebellion, Chiang's opinion did not attract Sun's attention. At that time, Sun Yat-sen was stationed in Guilin, preparing to march north into Hunan, and he still entrusted the defense of Guangdong to Chen Jiongming. Chen Jiongming thus gained time and successfully launched an armed rebellion in June 1922, leading to the failure of Sun Yat-sen's Second Protective War.

    蒋介石隐瞒密信铸大错
    一九一八年五月第一次护法战争失败后，孙中山虽已开始认识到南北军阀“如一丘之貉”，但他仍把统一中国、实现三民主义的希望寄托在援闽粤军总司令陈炯明的身上。然而，当时已成为新军阀的陈炯明正暗中和湖南水陆军总司令赵恒惕
  （赵后任湖南督军、省长）勾结，拟一旦时机成熟即公开与赵结成联盟，囚禁或架空孙中山，实行“联省自治”，称雄一方。
    谁知，赵恒惕在一九二一年八月间致陈炯明的一封密信被时任粤军第二支队司令官的蒋介石截获。蒋介石本想将此密信呈报孙中山，但他为了显示自己有超人的洞察力，在拜见孙中山时竟隐瞒了此事，故作先见之明地对孙说，陈炯明心怀叵测，应及早设法将其兵权解除。由于蒋介石隐瞒了足以证明陈炯明可能有异动的密信，故蒋的意见没有引起孙的重视。其时孙中山正坐镇桂林，准备入湘北伐，他仍将留守广东的重任交给了陈炯明。陈炯明因此而赢得了时间，顺利地于一九二二年六月公开发动武装叛乱，致使孙中山的第二次护法战争归于失败。
