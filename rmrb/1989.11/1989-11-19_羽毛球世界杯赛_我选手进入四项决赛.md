Reported by Huang Zhenzhong from Guangzhou on November 18th:

Chinese men's doubles players Li Yongbo and Tian Bingyi won their semifinal match against Indonesia's Hong Zhongzhong and Guo Hongyuan with a score of 2-0, concluding tonight's matches. In addition to this pair advancing to the finals, China also has Yang Yang in the men's singles, Han Aiping in the women's singles, and Lin Ying and Guan Weizhen in the women's doubles. Other finalists include: men's singles from Malaysia's Foo Kok Song, women's singles from Indonesia's Liusia, men's doubles from South Korea's Park Joo-bong and Kim Moon-soo, and women's doubles from South Korea's Hwang Hye-young and Chung So-young. The mixed doubles finalists are South Korean players Park Joo-bong and Chung Myung-hee, and Kim Moon-soo and Chung So-young.

The most exciting match today was between Li Yongbo and Tian Bingyi against the Indonesian players. The two Chinese players had excellent coordination. One player attacked from the backline with powerful shots, while the other used soft drops and quick attacks near the net. Their shots were precise, often landing in the gaps between the Indonesian players, making it difficult for them to return the ball. Every time they scored a point, the audience cheered loudly, creating a wave of excitement. The scores for the two sets were 15-4 and 15-5.

The finals of this World Cup will be held tomorrow evening.

    羽毛球世界杯赛
    我选手进入四项决赛
    本报广州11月18日电　记者黄振中报道：我国男双选手李永波、田秉毅在世界杯羽毛球锦标赛半决赛中以2∶0战胜印尼的洪忠中、郭宏源，结束了今晚的全部比赛。中国除这一对选手进入决赛外，男单有杨阳、女单有韩爱萍，女双有林瑛、关渭贞进入决赛。其它进入决赛的选手是：男单马来西亚的付国强、女单印尼的王莲香，男双南朝鲜的朴柱奉、金文秀，女双南朝鲜黄惠英、郑素英。混双选手是南朝鲜选手的朴柱奉、郑明熙和金文秀、郑素英。
    今天打得最为精彩的是李永波和田秉毅对印尼选手的交锋。两人配合默契。一个在底线远程轰击，一个在网前轻吊、快攻。球的落点刁，常常打在印尼两名选手结合部，使之无法救起。往往是杀一个球，观众齐喊一声，形成声浪。两局比分是15∶4、15∶5。
    明晚将进行本届世界杯赛的决赛。
