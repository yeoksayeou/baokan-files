Bush and Thatcher Hold Talks

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 24 - U.S. President Bush today held a meeting with visiting British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at Camp David in Maryland, which lasted over four hours. They exchanged views on the situation in Eastern Europe, NATO, and the upcoming U.S.-Soviet summit next week.

A statement released by the White House after the meeting said that President Bush briefed Thatcher on his plans to meet with Gorbachev in Malta, as well as issues related to the situation in Eastern Europe. Both sides also exchanged views on Soviet reforms, agreeing that "seeking democracy" is the first step in the reform process.

White House officials believe that Bush's meeting with Thatcher is part of his preparations for the summit with Gorbachev, and it also serves to assure allies that U.S. foreign policy will not undergo significant changes as a result of the U.S.-Soviet summit.

Bush had met with West German Foreign Minister Genscher in Washington a few days earlier and had been communicating with other allied leaders via telephone regarding the upcoming U.S.-Soviet summit.
