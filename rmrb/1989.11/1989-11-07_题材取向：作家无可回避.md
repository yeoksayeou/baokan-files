In the theoretical exploration and creative endeavors of literature in the new era, a significant issue that cannot be overlooked is the profound transformation of literary concepts. Directly reflecting this transformation and imbued with significant meaning is the expansion of writers' freedom in choosing themes. Writers' yearning for and constant pursuit of freedom in theme selection have become an important driving force in the development of literature in the new era.

The current issue is whether, while fully affirming the artistic individuality of writers and their individualistic aesthetic tastes, and fully affirming the positive significance and role of theme selection freedom in artistic development, we can emphasize the orientation of theme selection? Does the orientation of theme selection have a sublime socio-aesthetic significance?

The reason for revisiting the theme issue now is the deep concern over the emergence of another trend in the literary world against the backdrop of theme selection freedom: the actual existence of theme singularity, as well as the bewilderment and confusion of some writers in the conditions of theme selection freedom. Since 1985, the literary world, with theme selection freedom as a prerequisite, has seen the rise of "avant-garde novels" leading the trend. Most of the works by these writers have brought new faces in terms of humanism and textuality. However, regardless of how much new quality there is, it cannot cover up this flaw: whether it is "Death Narrative," "Moon Chasing Tower," "Worldly Affairs Like Smoke," or "Lost Boat" ... the themes involved are very similar, showing a clear trend of singularity. A group of writers write very outdated, trivial themes far removed from the times, and a group of writers' aesthetic concepts and tastes tend to be the same. Is this not precisely the tragedy of theme selection freedom? Death and sex are the two major themes that avant-garde novelists are fond of, and can also be seen as two major themes they have developed. The descriptions of these themes have reached an astonishingly similar level. More importantly, such a group of writers is repeatedly "defended" and praised by new trend literary critics, and such a group of works is widely interpreted and promoted, which will inevitably influence subsequent creators and critics, and will inevitably create the impression that the themes focused on and elaborated by these writers and works are the themes that are currently popular in the literary world. The original meaning of theme selection freedom lies in its leading to the multifaceted selection, multi-angle excavation, and multi-level expansion of themes, bringing about the prosperity of artistic creation. The literary changes of a few years have fully demonstrated the necessity of theme selection freedom, but the avant-garde novels themselves have fallen into the limitation of theme similarity. Especially in the environment where the tide of commodity economy is sweeping everything and writers are in a state of uncertainty, the above-mentioned guidance and possible results cannot but make us deeply concerned.

Writers' creative individuality should have a clear and relatively consistent theme orientation. Even in the context of highly emphasizing individuality and fully free theme selection, it is still possible to lose one's creative individuality and aesthetic characteristics due to some psychological inertia. The birth of any literary work cannot avoid the era background and the possibilities provided by history. It is the spiritual echo of the people in that era and the real reflection of that historical stage, which itself constitutes the era orientation of the theme. This theme era orientation is precisely the orientation I want to encourage, which is characterized by responsible and mission-conscious writers closely selecting, scrutinizing, examining, deeply thinking about, and exploring the reality of their existence, struggle, pain, and confusion. Even avant-garde novels, which are obviously influenced by foreign thoughts, must have an internal spiritual response to any foreign thought, and must have some isomorphism with our life essence. The artistic excavation of this internal spirit and life essence can also be a work that is close to reality and the times, as long as it is a serious "play" rather than a random one. Belinsky said well: Literature and art must express the interests of the century and the spirit of the times. The best works must bear the stamp of their era in both spirit and form, and meet the demands of their era. Therefore, emphasizing the orientation of themes is not opposed to the freedom of theme selection, but rather, under the illumination of this freedom, writers consciously strive to explore "how to write"; it is also not opposed to the free choice of modern artists in artistic structure, because this is to call for and accommodate the vast spirit of modernity.

The history of literature at home and abroad has repeatedly proven that literature has always been opening up its own path through thorns. I see behind the above-mentioned "choice" the personality of the weak: the inability to choose themes from the times, the inability to explore the living conditions of people in reality, the helplessness in the face of the theme of the times "how to write," and the covering up of one's own pallor and weakness under the banner of theme selection freedom, lacking the courage and bravery to face the stern challenges of reality. This literary phenomenon is precisely eroding the sanctity of "theme selection freedom." Because, under this "pretext," countless real-time themes have been grandly abandoned; when criticizing this literary phenomenon, the counter-criticizers raise the same "flag."

However, any writer cannot avoid this law: "The trend of the times always occupies the dominant position. Talents attempting to develop in other directions will find that the path is blocked; the pressure of public opinion and social customs sets a path for the artist, either suppressing the artist or forcing him to change his tune." (Dana, "Philosophy of Art")

    题材取向：作家无可回避
    蔡桂林
    新时期文艺理论开拓和创作探索，一个不容忽视的问题是人们的文学观念的深刻变革。直接呈现这个变革又深具意义的是作家题材选择自由度的拓展。作家对题材选择自由的向往和不断追求，构成新时期文学发展的重要内驱力。
    现在的问题是，在充分肯定作家的艺术个性及其个性化的审美趣味，充分肯定题材选择自由在艺术发展中的积极意义和作用的同时，可不可以强调题材选择的取向性？题材选择取向性有没有崇高的社会—美学的意义？
    现在重提题材问题，是深感于文坛在题材选择自由的背景下出现的另一种倾向：事实上存在的题材的单一化，以及一部分作家在题材选择自由条件下选择的惘然和困惑。自1985年以来的文坛，以题材选择自由为先决条件得以萌生的“先锋小说”领着风骚。这批作家的大部分作品，在人本和文本方面带来了新面貌。但无论这种新质具有多少，都无法掩盖这样一个缺陷：无论是《死亡叙述》，还是《追月楼》，是《世事如烟》，还是《迷舟》……所涉及的题材都很相似，呈现明显的单一化趋向。一批作家都写很陈旧、琐屑，远离时代的题材，一批作家审美观念、审美趣味的趋同，是不是恰恰是题材选择自由的悲哀？死亡、性是先锋小说家热衷的两大主题，也可看作已被他们衍化成为两大题材，对它的描写已经到了惊人趋同的地步。更重要的还在于，这样一批作家被文坛新潮评论家一再“辩护”和颂扬，这样一批作品被广泛读解和宣传，必然会影响后继的创作者和评论者，势必造成这批作家、作品所关注、铺写的题材就是今日文坛走红的题材的印象。题材选择自由的本来意义在于它导致对题材的多方面撷取、多角度挖掘和多层面拓展，带来艺术创作的繁荣。几年的文学流变，充分显现题材选择自由必要性的先锋小说自身却陷入了题材趋同的局限。特别是在商品经济大潮冲荡一切的环境中，且作家又处于无着的时候，上述的那种导向和可能引出的结果就不能不使我们殷殷关注了。
    作家的创作个性应该有自己明确、相对一贯的题材取向。即便在高扬个性、题材择取充分自由的情境中，依然可能因某种心理惯性而丧失自己创作个性和审美特性。任何一部文学作品的诞生，都无法回避时代背景和历史提供的可能，都是那个时代中人的精神回响，都是那个历史阶段的现实投影，这本身已构成题材时代性的取向。这种题材的时代性，正是我要鼓励的取向性，它着重表现为有责任感、使命感的作家面对自己生存、挣扎、痛苦、困惑中的现实生活的近距离撷取、逼视、审察、深思和探索。即如先锋小说，它显然受到外来思想影响，但任何一种外来思想的接受，必然有其内在精神的响应，必定与我们生活的内质具有某种同构性。对这种内在精神、生活内质的艺术挖掘，同样可能是切近现实和时代的作品，只要它是严肃的而不是随意的“玩”。别林斯基说得好：文学艺术必须表现世纪的兴趣和时代的精神，最好的作品都要在精神和形式上带有它那个时代的烙印，并满足它那个时代的要求。因此说，强调题材的取向性并不对立于题材选择的自由，而是在这自由之光沐浴下作家自觉地努力探求“怎样写”；它更不对立于现代艺术家在艺术结构上的自由选择，因为这是为了呼唤和容纳现代宏阔的精神。
    中外文学史都反复证明，文学从来都是在荆棘中为自己开辟通路。我于上面那种“选择”的背后看见的是弱者人格：对时代题材择取上的无能为力，对现实中人的生存境况探求的力不从心，对时代主题“怎样写”的束手无策，在题材选择自由的口号下掩盖本身的苍白虚弱，没有面对严峻的现实的挑战魄力和勇气，这种文学现象恰恰在消解“题材选择自由”的神圣性。因为，在这个“幌子”下面，无数的现实时代题材被冠冕堂皇地放弃掉了；面对这种文学现象提出批评时，反批评者扯起的又是这面“大旗”。
    然而，任何作家都无法回避这样一个规律“时代的趋向始终占着统治的地位。企图向别方向发展的才干会发觉此路不通；群众思想和社会风气压力，给艺术家定下一条发展的路，不是压制艺术家，就是逼他改弦易辙。”（丹纳《艺术哲学》）
