During the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, I recalled the heroes who attended the National Conference of War Heroes in 1950. These heroes who made great contributions to the founding of the People's Republic are now working and living how? Here are a few reports.

**Song Shuang Lai – Building a Military Academy Amidst Hardships**

The Shijiazhuang Army Academy is already a world-renowned military academy. However, few people know that its main founder, Political Commissar Song Shuang Lai, had never run a military academy before.

Song Shuang Lai is a battle hero known for his prowess in both attack and defense, as well as his courage and ingenuity. After the founding of New China, he gradually rose from a grassroots commander to a leadership position in a division and an army, and has long been engaged in ideological and political work. Before the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, he was tasked with establishing the Shijiazhuang Army Academy. The campus was a barren hill. Song Shuang Lai, along with the old principals Yuan Jie and Li Laizhu, led the faculty and staff to work tirelessly for three years, and built a "military academy city."

Building the academy was difficult, but finding a new way to meet the needs of the new era's military construction was even more challenging. To explore new paths for political education, Song Shuang Lai wrote articles such as "Research on Regular Ideological and Political Work in the Company" and "The Transformation from a Young Student to a Qualified Soldier," and oversaw the compilation of works such as "Research on Military Education Psychology." These efforts played an active role in improving the academy's teaching and the ideological and political work at the grassroots level of the troops.

Now, the Shijiazhuang Army Academy has become the "cradle of young officers." Over the past decade, it has trained and supplied nearly 20,000 qualified junior commanders for the troops. Their experiences have been highly praised by the leaders of the Central Military Commission and the State Education Commission.

In October 1988, Song Shuang Lai was honored with the rank of Major General. At the end of last year, he was appointed as the Political Commissar of the PLA Army Command Academy. This 63-year-old old hero is still full of vigor and determined to create new achievements.

**Zhao Shunyi – Spreading Revolutionary Traditions in His Hometown**

Before his retirement in 1981, Zhao Shunyi was the Deputy Political Commissar of a certain artillery division in the Shenyang Military Region. One might think that after decades of revolutionary struggles and hard work, he should enjoy some peace and quiet. But he didn't! He saw retirement as a "change of battlefield." After retiring, he devoted most of his energy to spreading revolutionary traditions, serving as the honorary principal and external tutor of more than 20 schools.

In the spring of 1987, Zhao Shunyi returned to Xiahe Village in Fengning Manchu Autonomous County, Hebei Province. During the day, he would chat with farmers in the fields or climb Sleeping Tiger Mountain to survey the area; at night, he would sit on the kang (a traditional heated bed) with everyone, discussing plans for prosperity.

This was his third time back home. The first time, he brought the spirit of the Central Document No. 1 to his fellow villagers. He visited over 50 specialized households, key households, and households in difficulty, and held meetings with officials and villagers. He used the opportunity of market days and village film screenings to explain the Central Document No. 1 to the people, bringing the party's rural policies to the hearts of his fellow villagers.

The second time he returned home, the old hero brought 579 high-quality chickens and over a hundred rural science popularization books. This time, he focused on helping his fellow villagers solve the problem of lacking scientific knowledge and not knowing how to get rich. With his help, a science popularization group led by the village party branch secretary and consisting of 18 specialized households was established. Since the science popularization group had no place to meet, he donated his only property in his hometown—a half-brick house.

The villagers followed the old hero's methods, focusing on both afforestation and animal husbandry, and the production situation showed a trend of overall development. Currently, every hill and mountain in Xiahe Village are planted with apricot trees, hawthorn, pear trees, and poplar trees; large livestock have increased by over 100 heads, and pigs, chickens, and rabbits have also seen significant development. The villagers happily said, "The old hero has returned home three times, bringing three gifts. Xiahe Village's economy has taken three big steps in three years!"

**Gao Ru Yi – Insisting on Being a Farmer**

On April 22, 1949, Xinhua News Agency broadcasted a news item written by Chairman Mao: "The People's Liberation Army's million-strong army crossed the Yangtze River. The People's Liberation Army's central army first broke through the Anqing-Wuhu line on the northern bank of the Yangtze River. At that time, the first boat that landed on the southern bank from the Anqing section, covering the main force's successful crossing, was led by Gao Ru Yi and his combat squad. Later, the entire squad was awarded a collective first-class merit, and Gao Ru Yi was named a first-class war hero.

After the Korean War, Gao Ru Yi was the acting platoon leader of the famous "Red Ninth Platoon." Gao Ru Yi thought that he was already in his forties, had no education, and staying in the army would not be beneficial for building a modern national defense. Considering the revolutionary cause, it would be better to leave. He declined the leaders' repeated requests to stay and resolutely returned to his hometown—Xingtang County, Hebei Province—to work as a member of the porter's union. In 1963, he returned to the countryside to farm.

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Gao Ru Yi's life improved significantly, but compared to the relatively wealthy families in the village, his family was still far behind. We took a look at the old hero's home, which was bare with nothing valuable. The few quilts on the kang were patched and mended. The earthenware basin on the stove held a few corn cakes and half a flatbread. Others often felt sorry for the old hero's living conditions, but he said, "Without the party's cultivation and the people's support, I wouldn't have become a hero. Besides, the government gives me a monthly subsidy, so how can I bother them again?"

When I visited Gao Ru Yi, the old hero showed me a 1950 "Memorial Publication of the National Conference of War Heroes" and a notebook with signatures from party and military leaders such as Zhou Enlai, Xiao Hua, and Fu Zhong. As he flipped through the pages, he said to me, "At any time, we must not forget the party's teachings, not forget the revolutionary traditions, and not forget the martyrs who sacrificed themselves..."

### 火红的晚霞——几位老英雄的新业绩

    火红的晚霞
    ——几位老英雄的新业绩
    新华社记者　赵苏
    在庆祝建国40周年的日子里，我想起出席1950年的全国战斗英雄代表会议的英雄们。这些为创建人民共和国立下过汗马功劳的英雄，现在工作生活怎样？这里报告几位。
    宋双来——艰苦创军校
    石家庄陆军学院已经是闻名世界的军校了。可是很少有人知道，其主要创建人宋双来政委，从未办过军校。
    宋双来是一位能攻善守、勇敢机智的战斗英雄。新中国成立后，他从一名基层指挥员逐步走上师、军领导岗位，长期从事思想政治工作。党的十一届三中全会召开前夕，他受命组建石家庄陆军学院。院址是一片荒山。宋双来和老院长袁捷、李来柱一起，带领教职员工苦战3年，硬是建起一座“军校城”。
    建校难，创出一条适应新时期部队建设需要的办学新路子更难。为探索政治课教学的新路，宋双来撰写了《连队经常性思想政治工作研究》、《从一名青年学生到一名合格军人的转变》等论文，主持编写了《军事教育心理学研究》等著作，对改进学院的教学和部队基层的思想政治工作，起了积极的推动作用。
    现在，石家庄陆军学院已成为“青年军官的摇篮”。10年来，共为部队培养输送了近二万名合格的初级指挥员。他们的经验得到中央军委领导同志和国家教委的高度评价。
    1988年10月，宋双来光荣地被授予中将军衔。去年底，他被任命为中国人民解放军陆军指挥学院政治委员。这位63岁的老英雄，壮心不已，志在开创新的业绩。
    郅顺义——余热洒家乡
    郅顺义1981年离休前是沈阳军区炮兵某师副政委。按说，他为革命南征北战，鞍马劳顿几十年，该享几天清福了。可他不！他把离休看成是“转移阵地”。离休后，他把主要精力用在传播革命传统上，先后担任了20多所学校的名誉校长和校外辅导员。
    1987年春天，郅顺义回到河北省丰宁满族自治县小河村。白天他时而在地头与农民谈心，时而登上睡虎山远眺；晚上坐在土炕上，和大家共商致富大计。
    这已经是他第三次回故乡了。第一次回乡，他给乡亲们带来了中央一号文件精神。他走村串户，访问了50多个专业户、重点户和困难户，召开干部和村民座谈会。他利用赶集和村里演电影的机会，向群众宣讲中央一号文件，把党的农村政策送到乡亲们的心坎上。
    第二次回乡时，老英雄给乡亲们带来579只良种鸡和上百册农村科普读物。这次他重点帮助乡亲们解决缺乏科学知识、想富不会富的问题。在他的帮助下，一个由村党支部书记任组长，有18名专业户参加的科普小组成立了。科普小组没有活动场所，他就献出自己在家乡唯一的财产——一间半瓦房。
    乡亲们按照老英雄教的办法，一手抓造林，一手抓养殖，生产形势出现了全面发展的好势头。目前，小河村的山山岭岭都栽上杏树、山楂、梨树和落叶松；大牲畜增加100多头，猪、鸡、兔也有了很大发展。乡亲们高兴地说：“老英雄三次回乡，给家乡带来三份厚礼。小河村的经济，三年迈了三大步！”
    高如意——执意当农民
    1949年4月22日，新华社播发了毛主席亲自写的一条新闻：人民解放军百万大军横渡长江。长江北岸人民解放军中路军首先突破安庆、芜湖线。当时从安庆段第一船进抵南岸，掩护大部队胜利渡江的，正是高如意和他率领的战斗班。事后，全班荣记集体一等功，高如意被评为特等战斗英雄。
    朝鲜停战后，高如意是著名的“红九连”的代理连长。高如意想，自己毕竟是快40的人了，又没有文化，继续留在部队对建设现代化国防不利，从革命事业考虑，还是走为好。他谢绝了领导的再三挽留，毅然回到了故乡——河北省行唐县，当了搬运工会的干部。1963年，索性回乡务农。
    党的十一届三中全会以后，高如意的生活有了明显改善，但和村里那些比较富裕的人家比，他家还差得远。我们环顾了一下老英雄的家，四壁空空，没一件像样的东西。炕上的几床家织布被褥，补钉摞补钉。锅台上的瓦盆里，盛着几块玉米面菜饼子和半张烙饼。别人常为老英雄的生活境况抱不平，可他说：“没有党的培养，没有人民的支援，我也当不了英雄。再说，政府每月都发给我优抚金，我怎么好再麻烦他们呢？”
    当我访问高如意的时候，老英雄向我展开一本1950年“全国战斗英雄代表会议纪念刊”和一个有周恩来、肖华、傅钟等党和军队领导人亲笔签名的笔记本。他一面翻看，一面对我说：“什么时候都不能忘记党的教导，不能忘记革命的传统，不能忘记牺牲的烈士……”
