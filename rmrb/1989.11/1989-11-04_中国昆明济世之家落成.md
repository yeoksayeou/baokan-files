In a picturesque village on the western outskirts of Kunming, a group of elegant buildings has recently emerged. This is the Kunming House of Hope, built with funds from the British Leonard Cheshire International Foundation.

This afternoon, various dignitaries gathered here for the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Deng Pufang, Chairman of the China Disabled Persons' Federation, and Zhao Tingguang, Vice Governor of Yunnan Province and Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Disabled Persons' Federation, praised the foundation's friendship towards the Chinese people in their speeches.

Leonard Cheshire, the founder of the Leonard Cheshire International Foundation, who traveled from the United States to attend the ceremony, has long been dedicated to the welfare of disabled people worldwide. He said in his speech that the dream of collaborating with China to establish a House of Hope has finally been realized after many years. The construction of the Kunming House of Hope is so successful, marking a good beginning for further cooperation between us.

The Kunming House of Hope in China provides good living, rehabilitation, and learning conditions. In the future, each session can enroll 40 disabled youths from various ethnic groups within the province for treatment and vocational training.

    专程从美国赶来参加落成剪彩仪式的隆纳济世国际基金会创建人隆纳济世先生，一直热心于世界残疾人福利事业。他在讲话中说，多少年来想跟中国合作建立济世之家的理想，今天终于实现了。昆明济世之家建设得这么好，这是我们之间进一步合作的良好开端。
    中国昆明济世之家，有较好的生活、康复和学习条件。以后，每期可招收省内40名各民族中的残疾青少年到这里来进行治疗和职业培训。
