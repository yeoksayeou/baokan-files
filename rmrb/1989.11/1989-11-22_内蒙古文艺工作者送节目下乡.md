Cultural workers from Inner Mongolia bring performances to the countryside

	The People's Daily, Hohhot, November 20th — Reporter Ao Teng reports: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is simultaneously focusing on "cleaning up" and promoting cultural prosperity. They have organized cultural workers to bring healthy and popular performances to rural and pastoral areas, aiming to occupy the ideological and cultural front with socialist art.

	Yesterday, over 300 cultural workers from the autonomous region's direct-subordinate art troupes were divided into 8 performance teams and set off for rural and pastoral areas. Leaders from the autonomous region's party and government went to see them off.

	During the recent "cleaning up" work, the leaders of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region realized that to thoroughly eliminate the feudal and bourgeois decadent spiritual poisons, it is necessary to occupy the ideological and cultural front with socialist culture and art. They sincerely hope that cultural workers will present healthy and uplifting artistic works to occupy the ideological and cultural front. To this end, the various ethnic cultural workers and art troupes in Inner Mongolia have, in a relatively short period, prepared a number of artistic programs with good ideological content and popular appeal, and presented these programs to the grassroots masses, enriching and activating the cultural life of the people.

　　内蒙古文艺工作者送节目下乡
    本报呼和浩特11月20日电　记者傲腾报道：内蒙古自治区一手抓“扫黄”，一手抓文艺的繁荣，组织文艺工作者带上健康向上、群众喜闻乐见的文艺节目下乡，用社会主义文艺占领思想文化阵地。
    昨天，自治区直属文艺团体的300余名各族文艺工作者分8个演出队奔赴农村牧区。自治区党、政有关领导前去送行。
    内蒙古自治区领导在前一段“扫黄”工作中认识到：要彻底扫除封建主义和资产阶级腐朽的精神毒品，就必须用社会主义文化艺术占领思想文化阵地，他们殷切期望文艺工作者拿出健康向上的艺术作品来，占领思想文化阵地。为此，内蒙古各族文艺工作者和各文艺团体在较短的时间内赶排了一批思想内容好、群众喜闻乐见的文艺节目，并把这些节目献给基层群众，丰富和活跃人民群众的文化生活。
