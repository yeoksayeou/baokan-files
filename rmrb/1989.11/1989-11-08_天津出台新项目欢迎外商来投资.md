Tianjin today released 54 new projects to welcome foreign investment, and announced that it will provide assistance in areas such as transportation, energy, materials, and funding. This new measure will inject vitality into Tianjin's steadily rising foreign economic efforts.

In the first 10 months of this year, Tianjin approved 73 new joint ventures, with foreign investment totaling $77.43 million, an increase of 24.5% compared to the same period last year. Among these, projects signed with the United States, France, Japan, West Germany, and other countries, such as land leasing, pesticides, containers, and integrated telephones, are relatively large joint ventures. So far, Tianjin has established 397 joint ventures with 20 countries and regions, attracting over $400 million in foreign investment.

To more effectively utilize foreign capital and leverage the advantages of joint ventures, the Tianjin Foreign Investment Service Center, in collaboration with relevant departments, selected 54 industrial projects from 150 projects across 16 industries, including machinery, automobiles, metallurgy, and electronics, and introduced them one by one to nearly 30 foreign businessmen from Japan, the United States, Italy, Hong Kong, and other countries and regions today.

According to Tianjin Customs statistics, Tianjin's total import and export value in the third quarter was $61.175 million, an increase of 12% compared to the same period last year. At the Canton Fair, Tianjin's port achieved $310 million in transactions, an increase of 2.2% compared to the same period last year. In the context of a sluggish domestic market, utilizing various channels to explore international markets has become a hot topic among Tianjin's businesspeople.

    本报天津11月7日电  记者肖荻报道：天津市今天向外国企业家发布了54个欢迎投资的项目，并宣布在交通、能源、材料、资金等方面提供协助。这一新的措施，为天津市稳定上升的外经势头注入了活力。
    今年头10个月，天津新批准三资企业达73家，外商投资额7743万美元，比去年同期增加24.5％，其中同美、法、日、西德等国家所签土地租赁、农药、集装箱、集成电话等项目均为较大合资合同。至此，天津已同20个国家和地区建三资企业397个，吸收外资4亿多美元。
    为了更有效地利用外资，发挥三资企业优势，天津外国投资服务中心协同各有关方面依据全市工业产品结构调整计划，从机械、汽车、冶金、电子等16个行业150多项目中筛选出54个工业项目，今天向日、美、意、香港等国家和地区的近30位外商逐一介绍。
