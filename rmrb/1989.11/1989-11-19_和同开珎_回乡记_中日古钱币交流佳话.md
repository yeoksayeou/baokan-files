On October 9, the "Sino-Japanese Friendship Ancient Coin Exhibition" opened at the Kato Modern Art Museum in Chichibu City, Saitama Prefecture, Japan. Two "Wadō Kaichin" silver coins from the Shaanxi Provincial Museum in China sparked a story of friendly exchange between ancient coins of the two countries.

Before the year 708, most of the coins circulating in Japan were from China and the Korean Peninsula. Japan was unable to mint and issue coins mainly due to a lack of copper resources. In 707, copper ore was first discovered in Kurodani, present-day Chichibu City. In January 708, the local authorities presented a sample of the copper ore to the imperial court. Emperor Monmu was delighted. To celebrate this historic discovery, the year name was changed from "Regan" to "Wadō" in the same year. "Wa" is an ancient name for Japan, and "dō" is a simplified form of the character for copper. Historical records in Japan state that in May 708, the first batch of Japanese-made official silver coins was minted, inscribed with the characters "Wadō Kaichin." In August, copper coins were also minted in the style of the silver coins.

The "Wadō Kaichin" silver coins were discontinued the following year, circulating for only about a year and a half.

The discovery of "Wadō Kaichin" silver coins in China began 19 years ago with an archaeological find. In October 1970, during construction in Hejia Village on the southern outskirts of Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, a Tang Dynasty hoard was discovered. Over 1,000 artifacts were unearthed, mainly gold and silver items, as well as precious gems, rare medicines, and coins from China and abroad. The coins included: 30 "Kaiyuan Tongbao" gold coins and 421 silver coins from China; 5 "Wadō Kaichin" silver coins from Japan, 1 gold coin from the Eastern Roman Empire, and 1 silver coin from Persia. There was also a complete set of Chinese copper coins arranged in historical order. The famous archaeologist Xia Nai, after examining these coins, concluded that the owner of the hoard was a collector of ancient and foreign coins, a connoisseur.

Kato Takuji, a member of the Japanese House of Representatives from Chichibu City, is also an enthusiast of ancient coin collecting. Five years ago, during a trip to China, he saw the "Wadō Kaichin" silver coins unearthed in China at the Shaanxi Provincial Museum. Through the efforts of Mr. Kato and other Sino-Japanese individuals, this return of "Wadō Kaichin" to its homeland after more than 1,200 years was realized. Since the exhibition opened, news of the ancient coins sent by Japan to the Tang Dynasty returning to their original home spread rapidly, attracting a steady stream of visitors. Elderly people reminisced about the past, deeply moved by the long history of Sino-Japanese exchanges. Young people broadened their horizons and gained much knowledge.

However, there are still many mysteries surrounding the "Wadō Kaichin" coins that scholars from both countries need to explore. First, there is the issue of how to read the four characters "Wadō Kaichin." "Wadō" is a shortened form of the "Wadō" era name, and "kai" can be interpreted as "opening the country for circulation." The problem lies with the character "chin."

The Chinese academic community, represented by Guo Moruo's 1972 view, believes that "chin" is a simplified form of the character "bao," so "Wadō Kaichin" should be read as "Wadō Kaibao." However, some Japanese scholars argue that the "Wadō Kaichin" silver coins are Japan's earliest official currency, modeled after the Tang Dynasty's "Kaiyuan Tongbao," and that the ancient intention was to deliberately avoid the character "bao" and instead use the variant character "chin" for "zhen." Therefore, "Wadō Kaichin" should be read as "Wadō Kaizhen."

Secondly, the "Wadō Kaichin" silver coins may have been brought into China by the envoys to Tang Dynasty, but it is uncertain whether it was Abe no Nakamaro, Kibi no Makibi, or another envoy who carried them.

Additionally, some believe that historical records state that in January 708, Japan changed its era name from "Regan" to "Wadō," and by May, the first batch of official coins had been minted. This timeline and the level of casting technology at the time are both implausible. The "Wadō Kaichin" silver coins may have been manufactured in China and then transported to Japan, or they may have been made with the help of Chinese coin makers invited to Japan.

Despite the many questions surrounding "Wadō Kaichin," it is undoubtedly a testament to the friendly exchanges between China and Japan. The return of "Wadō Kaichin" will surely promote the aspirations and pursuits of the peoples of both countries for friendly exchanges.

    “和同开珎”回乡记
    ——中日古钱币交流佳话
    于青
    10月9日，在日本埼玉县秩父市加藤近代美术馆举行的“日中友好古钱币展览”开幕。来自中国陕西省博物院的两枚“和同开珎”银币（见右下图），引出一段中日两国古钱币友好交流的佳话。
    公元708年以前，日本国内流通的钱币，大多是从中国和朝鲜半岛流入的。日本不能铸造发行钱币，主要受限于铜资源贫乏。公元707年，位于现在秩父市的黑谷首次发现铜矿。708年1月，秩父地方上把铜矿样品献给朝廷，当时的元明天皇见之大喜。为庆贺这一历史性的发现，把同年庆元5年的年号改为“和同元年”。“和”为“日本”的古称，“同”为“铜”字的简写。日本有史书记载，708年5月铸造出第一批日本自制银币官钱，上刻“和同开珎”四字。8月又仿银钱式样造出铜钱。
   “和同开珎”银钱于次年废止，只流通了一年多时间。
    “和同开珎”银钱在中国境内发现，始于19年前的一次文物出土。1970年10月，在陕西省西安市南郊何家村的建筑施工中，发现了一个唐代窖藏。共出土各类文物1000多件，其中以金银器为主，还有宝玉珍饰、贵重药材、中外钱币等。这批文物中的中外钱币包括：中国的“开元通宝”金币30枚，银币421枚；日本的“和同开珎”银币5枚，东罗马金币1枚，波斯银币1枚。还有按历史顺序搜集的一套中国铜钱。著名考古学家夏鼐先生看过这些钱币后认为，窖藏的主人是搜集古钱币和外币的爱好者，是一个收藏家。
    现为日本众院议员的加藤卓二是秩父市出身的政治家，也是一位古钱币搜集爱好者。5年前在中国旅游途中，在陕西省博物院看到了中国出土的“和同开珎”银币。经过加藤先生等日中双方人士的努力，促成了这次“和同开珎”1200多年后的回乡之行。开展以来，日本人赠送给唐朝的古币重返故里的消息不胫而走，前来参观的人络绎不绝。老年人抚今追昔，对日中交流的悠久历史感慨不已。青年人则大开眼界，增长不少见识。
    然而，“和同开珎”古币还有不少奥秘有待两国学者探讨。首先是“和同开珎”四字的认读。“和同”是“和铜”年号的省略，“开”字可释为“开国通行”之意。问题出在“珎”字。
    中国学界以郭沫若1972年发表的观点为代表：“珎”字是繁体字“寳”字之略，“和同开珎”应读作“和同开宝”。但部分日本学者认为，“和同开珎”银币是日本最早的法定官钱，以唐朝钱币“开元通宝”为原型制造的，古人的用心在于特意回避“宝”字，而采用了“珍”字的异体字“珎”。因此，“和同开珎”应读作“和同开珍”。
    其次，“和同开珎”银币可能是遣唐使带入中国的，是阿部仲麻吕？吉备真备？还是其他遣唐使，现在无法考证出携带者的真实姓名。
    此外，有人认为，史载公元708年1月，日本年号由庆云改为和同，5月就制出首批官钱，这在时间上和当时日本的铸造技术上都是不可能的。“和同开珎”银币可能是在中国制造后运到日本的，或是日本请来中国铸币工匠帮助制造的等等。
    尽管围绕“和同开珎”尚存许多疑问。但是，“和同开珎”是中日两国友好交流的见证，“和同开珎”回乡将促进两国人民对友好交流的向往和追求，则是肯定无疑的。（附图片）
