The walls of the Enterprise Management Office of the Haidian District Industrial and Commercial Administration Bureau in Beijing are adorned with posters such as "Professional Ethics for Industrial and Commercial Management Personnel" and "Industrial and Commercial Management Handbook," which outline various anti-corruption regulations. They strictly adhere to these regulations in their work.

Last year, a representative from a certain military band came to their office to invite them to a meal. They spent three hours in the office, but the representatives were unable to persuade them to go. As they left, they remarked, "Upholding justice and integrity, truly deserving of the title of Communist Party's industrial and commercial officials!" They uniformly reject any gifts, regardless of who offers them or what they are. Recently, someone who came to apply for a license deliberately left a pack of cigarettes, from which two had been taken, on the office desk. Inside, they found several 50-yuan notes and a heavy gold ring. They immediately reported this to their superiors and later criticized the individual.

Last year, the Institute of Chemical Defense wanted to establish a science and technology development company. At that time, it was rumored that obtaining a license would take at least a year and a half and require connections and bribes. Two officials from the institute nervously came to their office. To their surprise, the process was completed in just 7 days. The military leadership specially sent a plaque reading: "Fair and upright, service-oriented," praising them as: "Always by the river, but never get your shoes wet."

    “就是不湿鞋”
    黄树杭　于又燕
    北京市海淀区工商管理局企业科办公室的墙上贴着“工商管理干部职业道德规范”、“工商管理手册”等廉政规章制度。企业科廉政制度怎么订，他们就怎么做。
    去年底，某军乐团派人上门来请吃饭，在办公室里，他们磨了整整3小时，硬是没把人请去。临走时，他们感慨地说：“秉公廉政，真不愧是共产党的工商干部！”对于那些送礼的人，不管是谁，不管送的是什么，他们一概谢绝。前不久，有个来办执照的人，将一包打开抽了两支的烟故意“忘”在办公桌上。他走后，科里人发现里面卷着几张50元面值的人民币和一个沉甸甸的金戒指，立刻向上级作了汇报，并在事后批评了那个人。
    去年底，防化兵研究院要办个科技开发公司。当时，社会上传说办执照最少要花一年半载，还要有关系，会送礼。两个经办人惴惴不安地找上门来。没想到，只用了7天就办完了。部队领导特意送来一面锦旗：“公正廉洁，服务热情”，称赞他们是：“常在河边走，就是不湿鞋”。
