The Guiyang Railway Bureau has resolutely investigated and handled illegal and disciplinary cases, using typical cases to educate a wide range of cadres and workers to promote the bureau's integrity building.

This year, the Party Committee of the Guiyang Railway Bureau has not relaxed its efforts in building integrity and has not been lenient in handling illegal and disciplinary cases. Several former leading cadres of the Guiyang Locomotive Section under the bureau illegally handled locomotive diesel, locomotive coal, and scrap locomotive parts, earning illegal income of over 3.25 million yuan, which was then transferred to a privately set "small treasury" for embezzlement and extravagant spending. Although these leading cadres had previously received various advanced and honorable titles from the province or the railway bureau and the division, the division's Party Committee did not cover up for them after receiving a report from the masses in April this year. They immediately sent people to investigate and cooperate with judicial authorities to handle the case. After several months of internal and external investigations, the case was finally cleared up. The section chief, Zhang Hanchai, and deputy section chief, Xu Jibin, have been arrested by law, and the section Party Committee secretary, Zhang Faming, is under bail pending trial.

After handling this case, the Party Committee of the Guiyang Railway Bureau was not afraid of exposing "family scandals." They made a television special about this typical case and sent it to various stations and sections along the line for screening to educate on honesty and public service.

After watching the special, the broad cadre and worker masses were greatly shocked, reflecting seriously, and using this as a warning to further strictly demand of themselves. From the division to the various station and section leadership teams, they all formulated "Several Regulations for Cadres to Maintain Integrity." The leading cadres took the lead in implementing them. For example, in the distribution of bonuses, leading cadres at all levels reduced the number of bonus items first, narrowing the income gap with workers; leading cadres who went to the grassroots all dined at the workers' canteens according to the regulations; in matters of car bodies and tickets, they insisted on collective approval and rotation of approving personnel, and set up reward and reporting supervision hotlines to prevent the phenomenon of seeking personal gain through cars and tickets.

    贵铁分局抓住典型案例促廉政
    三名段领导私设“小金库”贪污挥霍被查处
    本报贵阳11月6日电　记者潘帝都、胡跃平报道：贵阳铁路分局坚决查处违法违纪案件，并用典型案例教育广大干部职工，以推动全分局的廉政建设。
    今年以来，贵铁分局党委抓廉政建设不松劲，查处违法违纪案件不手软。分局下属的贵阳机务段原几名主要领导干部，擅自处理机车柴油、机车用煤和废旧机车配件等物资，非法收入325万余元，转入私设的“小金库”，大肆进行贪污和挥霍。尽管这几名领导干部都曾多次获得过省或铁路局、分局的各种先进荣誉称号，但分局党委今年4月接到群众举报后不护短，马上派人调查，配合司法部门进行查处。经过几个月的内查外调，终将这一特大案件查清，段长段汉才、副段长徐积斌已被依法逮捕，段党委书记张法明取保候审。
    查完这个案件后，贵铁分局党委不怕“家丑外扬”，他们把这一典型案例的材料拍成电视专题片，发到沿线各站段播放，进行廉洁奉公教育。
    广大干部职工看了专题片震动很大，认真反思，以此为戒，更加严格要求自己。从分局到各站、段领导班子，都制定了《干部保持廉洁若干规定》，领导干部带头贯彻执行。比如奖金分配问题，各级领导干部率先减少奖金项目，缩小了与职工的收入差距；领导干部下到基层，一律按规定标准到职工食堂用餐；在车皮、车票问题上，坚持集体审批和审批人员轮换制度，并设有奖举报监督电话，防止了以车、以票谋私的现象。
