		The Soviet Union held a military parade and mass rally in Moscow's Red Square today to celebrate the 72nd anniversary of the October Revolution.

		Soviet Defense Minister Yazov spoke before the parade began, emphasizing that the Soviet Union's disarmament measures have created conditions for reducing military spending, while the Soviet Union will still maintain an adequate level of military preparedness.

		This year's parade was relatively simple, with only 220 armored personnel carriers, tanks, rocket launchers, and other equipment participating in the inspection, all of which passed through the Red Square in less than 10 minutes.

		The rally participants held banners, slogans, flags, flowers, and balloons as they passed the review stand.

		Soviet leaders Gorbachev, Ryzhkov, and others attended the inspection. Gorbachev, in an interview with Soviet reporters, said: "The ideals chosen by the October Revolution are also the ideals we are loyal to." He stressed that during this critical period of reform, there is only progress, no retreat.

    苏联举行阅兵式和群众游行
    新华社莫斯科11月7日电　苏联今天在莫斯科红场举行阅兵式和群众游行，庆祝十月革命72周年。
    苏联国防部长亚佐夫在阅兵开始前讲话，强调苏联采取的裁军行动为削减军费开支创造了条件，同时苏联仍将保持足够的军备水平。
    今年阅兵式相当简单，一共只有220辆装甲运兵车、坦克、火箭炮等参加检阅，不到10分钟全部通过红场。
    游行群众举着标语、横幅、彩旗、鲜花和气球通过检阅台。
    苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫、雷日科夫等出席了检阅。戈尔巴乔夫在接受苏联记者采访时说：“十月革命选择的理想也是我们忠于的理想。”他强调在当前改革的转折时期，只能前进，不能后退。
