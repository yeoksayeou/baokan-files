To promote cultural and artistic exchanges between young people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the Guangxi People's Publishing House and the Guilin Youth Palace jointly organized an exhibition of paintings by Li Yan, a young artist from Guilin, and Han Yansong, a young artist from Hsinchu, Taiwan. The exhibition opened today at the National Art Museum of China.

Audiences in the capital viewed 149 works, showcasing the extraordinary talent and creativity of the two young artists. Li Yan, a 17-year-old girl, has been passionate about painting since childhood. She has held personal exhibitions in the United States, Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan. Her paintings of horses rearing and landscapes in ink are particularly striking. Han Yansong, a 15-year-old from Taiwan, is known as a "child prodigy painter." His ink paintings have been praised by the renowned Chinese painter Zhang Daqian.

Kang Keqing, Zhao Puxiu, Cheng Siyuan, and Wang Feng attended the opening ceremony and jointly cut the ribbon.

After the exhibition in Beijing, the paintings will also be displayed in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Guangxi People's Publishing House will publish a large-scale album of the two young artists' works.

　　海峡两岸少年画家联办画展
    本报北京十一月二十一日讯　为促进海峡两岸少年文化艺术交流，由广西人民出版社、桂林市少年宫主办的桂林市少年画家李焱和台湾新竹市少年画家韩言松绘画作品联展今天在中国美术馆开幕。
    首都观众从一百四十九件作品中，看到了两位少年画家非凡的灵气与才气。十七岁的少女李焱从小热爱丹青技艺，曾在美国、日本、新加坡、台湾等地举办过个人画展。她笔下的马仰天长啸、泼墨山水则起落有致。台湾少年韩言松年仅十五岁，有“天才小画家”之称，他的水墨作品，曾得到国画大师张大千的赞赏。
    康克清、赵朴初、程思远、汪锋同志今天共同为开幕式剪彩。
    画在北京首展后，还将赴香港、台湾等地展出。广西人民出版社将为两少年出版大型画册。　（援军）
