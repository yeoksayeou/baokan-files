The first international academic conference on the "Gesar" epic held since the founding of the People's Republic of China concluded today in Chengdu.

Scholars from the Soviet Union, Japan, and other countries, totaling 12, along with more than 30 scholars and researchers from within China, participated in this conference, which began on November 1st.

The "Gesar" is a great epic created by the Tibetan people of China, consisting of 10 million words in 100 million lines and 120 volumes. It is comparable to the famous Homeric epics of ancient Greece and the Indian epics, being a brilliant gem in the world's cultural treasury.

The "Gesar" epic is not only widespread in Tibet, Qinghai, and other provinces and autonomous regions of China but has also been circulating in many countries in Europe and Asia since the 18th century.

This international academic conference on the "Gesar" received more than 50 academic papers. These papers cover a wide range of topics, with many insightful and unique perspectives. Some experts believe that this international academic exchange has broadened research horizons and raised the academic level of "Gesar" studies.

The conference also held an exhibition showcasing the collection and organization of academic materials, books, and various research achievements related to the "Gesar."

    来自苏联、日本等国的12名学者和国内30多名学者、研究人员参加了这次从11月1日开始的讨论会。
    《格萨尔》是我国藏族人民创作的一部伟大英雄史诗，有100万诗行，1000多万字，120部。它同古希腊著名的荷马史诗、印度史诗一样，是世界文化宝库中的璀璨明珠。
    《格萨尔》史诗，不仅在我国的西藏、青海等省、自治区流传，而且早在18世纪就流传到欧亚许多国家。
    这次《格萨尔》国际学术讨论会，共收到学术论文50多篇。这些论文论述的范围比较广泛，其中有不少精辟独到的见解。一些专家认为，这次国际学术交流，拓展了研究视野，提高了《格萨尔》学的学术水平。
