Our reporter Jiang Jianke reports from Beijing: The Institute of Nutrition and Food Hygiene at the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medical Sciences has recently completed a study indicating that drinking tea has a certain anti-cancer effect.

This study was a project funded by the National Natural Science Foundation in 1988. The research team conducted a study on the inhibition of human carcinogenic nitrosamines in 145 types of tea from major tea-producing areas such as Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, and Jiangxi. It was found that the inhibition rate of green tea is over 90%, followed by compressed tea, flower tea, oolong tea, and black tea. The inhibitory effect is closely related to the method of tea processing.

This study provides new clues and evidence for humans to find natural anti-cancer substances. The results were presented to experts in Beijing today for evaluation.

    预防医学一项研究表明
    饮茶有一定防癌作用
    本报北京11月11日讯　记者蒋建科报道：中国预防医学科学院营养与食品卫生研究所最近完成的一项研究表明，饮茶具有一定的防癌作用。
    这项研究是1988年国家自然科学基金会资助的项目。课题组对浙江、安徽、福建、江西等主要产茶区的145种茶叶进行了阻断人体致癌性亚硝基化合物形成的研究，发现绿茶的阻断率在90％以上，其次为紧压茶、花茶、乌龙茶和红茶。其阻断效果与茶叶加工方式有密切关系。
    这项研究为人类寻找天然防癌物质提供了新的线索和证据，今天在北京通过专家鉴定。
