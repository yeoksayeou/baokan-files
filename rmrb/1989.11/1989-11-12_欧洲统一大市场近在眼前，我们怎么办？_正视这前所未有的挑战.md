The European Single Market is just around the corner. How should we respond? We must face this unprecedented challenge.

In June 1985, the European Commission submitted the "Completing the Internal Market" white paper to the European Council, proposing to establish a single market within the European Community by the end of 1992, where there are no borders, people can move freely, goods can circulate freely, services can be exchanged freely, and capital can flow freely. Since then, the "European Single Market" has been progressing step by step from blueprint to reality. The unification of a market with 323 million consumers will undoubtedly change the face of the world economy and will have a lasting impact on China's foreign economic relations.

The establishment of the single market will deepen the international division of labor within the European Community, expand cooperation in industry, technology, and other economic sectors. The results will be threefold: first, due to the absence of internal trade barriers, European Community products will have an advantage over imported products, thereby reducing imports; second, competition for exports to the European Community will become more intense; third, European Community products will be more competitive in the world market, increasing exports. In this situation, China is obviously at a disadvantage.

With the establishment of the single market, the European Community member states will speak "with one voice," increasing their bargaining power. To coordinate the interests of its member states, the European Community may strengthen its protection of traditional industries in less developed countries, such as Italy, Portugal, and Spain, which have advantages in labor-intensive industries like textiles, chemicals, and light industry. Additionally, the European Community will strengthen its regional policies and increase the share of structural funds to help the economic development of these member states, thereby posing a threat to China's exports to the European Community.

The establishment of the single market will make the technical standards and specifications of European Community products more uniform and move towards higher standards. It will be difficult for our exported products to adapt to this change.

The establishment of the single market will also have an adverse effect on China's introduction of foreign capital.

Currently, various signs indicate that the European Community's anti-dumping actions will increase, and the scope of anti-dumping will be broader. Anti-dumping has become the core of the Community's trade policy towards the Far East. Therefore, the price advantage that Chinese export enterprises once enjoyed may face obstacles.

In summary, China may gain new opportunities from the economic prosperity brought by the single market, but the unfavorable conditions we face will be more severe, and in some areas, there is even a risk of being squeezed out. We must face this unprecedented challenge.

    欧洲统一大市场近在眼前，我们怎么办？
    正视这前所未有的挑战
    1985年6月，欧共体执委会向欧洲理事会提交《完善内部市场》的白皮书，建议到1992年底前在欧共体内建成一个没有边界、人员可自由往来、商品可自由流通、劳务可自由交流、资本可自由流动的统一大市场。自此，“欧洲统一大市场”紧锣密鼓，一步步从蓝图变为现实。拥有3.23亿消费者内部市场的联合，无疑将改变世界经济的面貌，也将对中国的对外经济产生久远的影响。
    统一大市场的建立，有利于欧共体内部国际分工的深化，有利于其工业、科技及其他经济领域的协作关系的扩大。其结果有三：一是由于没有内部贸易壁垒，欧共体的产品比外来产品有优越性，因而可减少进口；二是各国向欧共体出口竞争更为激烈；三是欧共体产品在世界市场更有竞争力，出口增加。在这种情况下，我国显然处在不利的地位。
    统一大市场的建立，欧共体各成员国用“一个声音说话”，增加了谈判的砝码。欧共体为协调其内部各成员国之间的利益，有可能增强对其落后传统工业的保护，如意大利、葡萄牙、西班牙占相对优势的纺织、化工、轻工等劳动密集型行业。另外，欧共体将加强其地区政策，增加结构基金的份额，以帮助这些成员国的经济发展，由此将形成对中国向欧共体出口的威胁。
    大市场的建立，将使欧共体产品技术标准、规格趋于一致，并向高标准靠拢。我出口产品很难适应这一变化。
      统一大市场的建立，对中国引进外资也将产生不利影响。
      目前，种种迹象表明，欧共体反倾销行动将增加，反倾销范围将更广泛。反倾销已成为共同体对远东贸易政策的核心。因此，中国出口企业昔日的价格优势可能碰壁。
    总之，我国有可能从统一大市场带来的欧共体经济繁荣中获得新的机会，然而面临的不利条件将更严峻，在某些领域甚至有被挤出来的危险。我们必须正视这一前所未有的挑战。
