The General Administration of Customs recently issued the newly formulated "Measures for Customs Supervision of Luggage and Personal Effects of Inbound and Outbound Passengers of the People's Republic of China," which will come into effect on December 1, 1989.

The new "Measures" have made significant adjustments to the 1958 "Measures" and have the following main features: First, the new "Measures," based on relevant laws of our country and international practices, classify inbound and outbound passengers into two categories: "residents" and "non-residents." Depending on the length of stay in the country, the two categories of passengers are further divided into "long-term passengers" (more than one year) and "short-term passengers" (less than one year). Second, the measures implement classified management of inbound and outbound luggage and personal effects. Third, the rights and obligations of inbound and outbound passengers and their agents are clearly defined. For example, passengers carrying goods out of the country should be within reasonable quantities for personal use. Goods that are exempted from customs duties upon entry and are to be sold, rented, or otherwise transferred within two years from the date of entry must be approved by the customs and taxes must be paid according to the regulations. For cars brought in by passengers, if they need to be transferred after two years of use in the country due to special reasons, they must be approved by the customs. For those that are duty-free upon entry, taxes must also be paid according to the regulations.

    对进出境旅客行李物品海关实行新的监管办法
    新华社北京11月3日电  海关总署最近发布了新制定的《中华人民共和国海关对进出境旅客行李物品监管办法》，这一新办法将于1989年12月1日起实施。
    新的《监管办法》，对1958年的《监管办法》进行了较大调整，具有以下几个主要特点：一是新的《监管办法》根据我国有关法律及国际惯例，将进出境旅客划分为“居民”和“非居民”两大类，按照旅客进出境居留时间的长短，将两类旅客分为“长期旅客”（一年以上）和“短期旅客”（一年以下）两种；二是对进出境行李物品实行分类管理；三是明确规定了进出境旅客及其代理人的权利和义务。例如，旅客携运物品出境，应以自用合理数量为限。海关依法免税放行的物品，自进境之日起两年内因故需要出售、出租等形式移作他用的，应向海关申请批准并照章补税。对于旅客带进的汽车，在进境使用两年后，因特殊原因需要转让的，必须向海关申请批准，其中免税运进的，还应当按规定补缴税款。
