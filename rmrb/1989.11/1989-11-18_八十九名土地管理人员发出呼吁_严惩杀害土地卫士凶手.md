89 Land Management Personnel Appeal for Severe Punishment of Those Who Murdered Land Protectors

People's Daily Editorial Department:

The news published on the second page of your newspaper on October 17, 1989, titled "A Land Management Officer in Zhejiang Province Beaten to Death," has shocked us, the 89 land management personnel participating in land supervision training in Beijing. We wish to appeal through your newspaper for the relevant departments to severely punish the murderers of land protector Xia Jiliang.

The Land Management Law of our country has been in effect for three years, but incidents of assaulting land management personnel while they are on duty still occur from time to time. This not only directly endangers the legal rights and personal safety of land management personnel but also affects the effective management of land use. We demand that the relevant leaders and departments truly recognize the serious land crisis our country is currently facing. They should treat land management work with the same importance as family planning, adopting effective administrative, economic, legal, and technological measures to prevent such incidents from happening. They should ensure that the law is strictly enforced and that violators are brought to justice. We demand that leaders at all levels truly support land protectors and safeguard the personal safety of land management personnel while they are on duty.

Comrade Xia Jiliang was loyal to his duties, impartial in his enforcement of the law, and sacrificed his life to protect arable land. We should learn from him and contribute our efforts to improving land management work.

    八十九名土地管理人员发出呼吁
    严惩杀害土地卫士凶手人民日报编辑部：
    贵报1989年10月17日二版刊登的《浙江一土地管理员被殴致死》消息，使我们在京参加土地监察培训的89名土地管理工作人员极为震惊。我们想通过贵报呼吁，要求有关部门严惩杀害土地卫士夏继良的凶手。
    我国《土地管理法》已经颁布了3年，但殴打执行公务的土地管理工作人员事件仍时有发生，这不仅直接危害了土地管理人员的合法权益和人身安全，也影响了对土地使用的有效管理。我们要求有关领导和部门真正认识到我国目前所面临的严重土地危机，像重视计划生育那样重视土地管理工作，采取有力的行政、经济、法律和技术手段，防范这类事件的发生，切实做到有法必依、执法必严、违法必究。我们要求各级领导真正为土地卫士撑腰，保护执行公务的土地管理人员的人身安全。
    夏继良同志忠于职守，秉公执法，为保护耕地牺牲了自己的生命。我们要向他学习，为搞好土地管理工作贡献自己的力量。
