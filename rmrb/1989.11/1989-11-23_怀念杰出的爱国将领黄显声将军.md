We have known the patriot General Huang Xiansheng for a long time. His revolutionary spirit of loving the country, loving the people, and pursuing truth, as well as his noble character of being upright, steadfast, and fearless of death, still lingers in our hearts.

(I)

Huang Xiansheng was born in Fengcheng County, Liaoning Province, in 1896. During his studies at Peking University, he actively participated in the May Fourth Movement. Later, due to his "radical" speeches and "unconventional" behavior, he was expelled from the school. He then resolutely took up arms, enrolling in the third class of the Artillery Department at the Northeastern Military Academy in 1921. After graduating, he served continuously in the Northeastern Army. During his tenure as the commander of the First Brigade of the Northeastern Army in 1928, he took a clear patriotic stance, supporting Zhang Xueliang in his struggle against the pro-Japanese faction in the Northeast, and carrying out the Northeast Flag Change, thwarting Japan's imperialist plot to annex the Northeast.

In 1930, Huang Xiansheng served as the director of the Liaoning Public Security Bureau and the chief of the Shenyang Public Security Bureau. He supported Yans Baohang, Che Xiangqin, and other patriotic progressives in organizing the Liaoning Anti-Opiate Union, implementing strict anti-opium (opium) and anti-gambling measures, and resisting pressure from the Japanese consul. He supported the people in holding a mass anti-opiate rally, publicly burning large quantities of opium and heroin smuggled in by Japanese merchants.

General Huang, for the sake of national interests, strongly resisted the continuous expansion of Japanese imperialism in Northeast China. He fought back against the "South Manchuria Railway" military police who took advantage of Japanese privileges to cause trouble and bully people. When the "September 18 Incident" broke out, the public security sub-bureaus in the southern part of Shenyang and Sanjing Road all followed his orders to resist, making them the only armed forces in Shenyang at that time that did not carry out the "non-resistance" order.

After the Liaoning Provincial Government and the Northeast Border Defense Command Headquarters moved to Jinzhou, the acting chairman of the provincial government, Mi Chunlin, and the acting chief of staff, Rong Zhen, often resided in Beijing and Tianjin. The work of the military and political departments in Jinzhou was actually managed by General Huang Xiansheng. In late September, he first reorganized all the police and public security forces that had retreated to Jinzhou, as well as the soldiers recruited from various counties, into three cavalry brigades. Later, he drafted a plan to organize the people's anti-Japanese volunteer army, aiming to form volunteer armies with the police forces as the core in various counties. Thus, there was a rumor of 80,000 volunteer armies in Liaoxi. Some patriotic figures in Beijing who sought Zhang Xueliang to resist Japan were also introduced to the Jinzhou Provincial Government Public Security Bureau. Patriots from all sides flocked to Jinzhou to volunteer for the anti-Japanese war. General Huang maintained close contact with Northeast patriots such as Yans Baohang, Che Xiangqin, and Lu Guangji, and cooperated closely with the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese Salvation Association organized in Beijing. He devoted himself to organizing the volunteer army.

From October to November 1931, the Kwantung Army headquarters organized two large-scale traitor forces led by Ling Yincheng and Zhang Xuecheng (Zhang Xueliang's cousin), aiming to use them as vanguards to first attack Jinzhou, then control Liaoxi, and prepare for the Japanese army's advance into the interior. Huang Xiansheng resolutely suppressed Ling Yincheng and Zhang Xuecheng, foiling the enemy's plot to use Chinese to control Chinese. He said, "Anyone who surrenders to Japan to become a traitor will be eliminated." Zhang Xueliang highly praised this and once received and rewarded those who had meritorious service in eliminating traitors at the German Restaurant in Beijing. He then entrusted Huang to manage the military and political affairs in Jinzhou, supporting the expansion of local armed forces to fight against Japanese invaders. At the end of November, the Fourth Brigade of the Japanese Army invaded Liaoxi. General Huang organized several volunteer armies led by Geng Jizhou and Xiang Qingshan to fiercely resist in the western part of Xinmin County. The battle of Qinggangzi lasted from 9 AM to 3 PM, severely defeating the Japanese army and delaying their westward advance. He then sent a telegram to Zhang Xueliang and the Salvation Association, suggesting that they quickly send people to Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaodong to organize volunteer armies. Song Li, Che Xiangqin, and other figures, along with a large number of people (some with Zhang Xueliang's secret orders), secretly left the pass and went to various places to organize volunteer armies, giving the Northeast volunteer army new development. After Jinzhou fell, General Huang commanded the volunteer armies in the Liaoxi Hotian area to actively resist Japan. At that time, the Japanese puppet newspapers also published reports such as "Huang Xiansheng, who takes it upon himself to disturb Fengtian with a large group of bandits (referring to the volunteer army)," "Huang Xiansheng's volunteer army is launching a large-scale attack," and "Huang Xiansheng commands ten counties, with 80,000 militia." Later, someone praised Huang Xiansheng as the "first person of the Great Wall of flesh and blood" for his anti-Japanese struggle. Although this is a literary compliment, considering the early organization of the volunteer army, its large scale, and deep influence, it is not an exaggeration.

In the autumn of 1932, Zhang Xueliang reorganized Huang Xiansheng's troops into the Second Cavalry Division. In early 1933, during the Long March on the Great Wall, he led the division to attack the enemy in the Baima Pass area and later withdrew under the pressure of the Nationalist 25th Division. Later, General Feng Yuxiang organized the Anti-Japanese Allied Army in Chahar and Suiyuan. At that time, Huang's troops were stationed in the Huairou area, serving as a barrier for the southern part of the Allied Army. He sent people to meet Feng, agreeing to participate in the action at an appropriate time and support the Allied Army. He prepared to send Liu Lanbo (Liu Lanbo, who had been assisting Huang in organizing the volunteer army in Jinzhou since the "September 18 Incident," and had been serving as his secretary ever since) to lead a volunteer team to advance to Chahar and Suiyuan to participate in the action. At the same time, he often sent secret telegrams about the defense situation of the Nationalist troops in the Pingxi area to the Allied Army, maintaining coordination, and persuaded the leaders of the volunteer armies who had retreated from the Northeast, such as Feng Zhanhai and Geng Jizhou, to accept Feng Yuxiang's leadership and continue to resist Japan. After the failure of the Allied Army, he accepted the suggestion of the Communist Party and led the division to advance into Rehe, Luanping, and Fengning. However, due to the signing of the "He-Mei Agreement," he was forced to withdraw again, leaving his ambitions unfulfilled.

(II)

Under the education of practical struggles, Huang Xiansheng realized that Zhang Xueliang, the commander of the Northeast Army, was bound by Chiang Kai-shek's "non-resistance" order, with many contradictions in his thoughts. If this continued, not only would the recovery of the Northeast be hopeless, but the future of the Northeast Army would also be bleak. Therefore, he contacted the North China Bureau of the Communist Party through Liu Lanbo and invited Sun Zhiyuan, Bai Jian, Kang Shaoyi (Kang Jiansheng), Zhu Dagang, and Liu Jinghu, a group of Communist Party members, to the Second Cavalry Division to help rebuild the troops and prepare to go out and fight guerrilla warfare. At that time, the Communist Party's divisional committee was established within the Second Cavalry Division, and a training team led by Communist Party members was set up (Liu Lanbo served as the team leader, Sun Zhiyuan and Kang Shaoyi as instructors, and Liu and Sun as secretaries, while Kang served as the division's quartermaster in public). Soldiers' committees were also established. With his support, he resisted all reactionary activities of the Nationalist Party's political training personnel and eliminated the spy elements sent by the Nationalist Party. He openly carried out political propaganda, taught progressive songs, and made the troops' anti-Japanese sentiment very high. The divisional committee also established night schools in the local area and developed the party's organization. Therefore, the Second Cavalry Division was called a "red to the core" division by Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin, who regarded Huang Xiansheng as a "rebellious and unruly person."

In the autumn of 1935, when Zhang Xueliang served as the deputy commander-in-chief of the Northwest "Extermination" Headquarters, he appointed Huang Xiansheng as the deputy commander and chief of staff of the Cavalry Army. The establishment of this army was originally intended by Chiang Kai-shek to be used to "exterminate" the Communists in the Northwest. Therefore, Huang Xiansheng advised Zhang not to fall into Chiang Kai-shek's "two birds with one stone" policy and persuaded Zhang to unite with the Communists to resist Japan. He did not hide his political inclinations in the Cavalry Army, resolutely expelled the interference of Nationalist Party spies, and refused to carry out Chiang Kai-shek's orders, making the Cavalry Army the only division in the Northeast Army at that time that had no friction with the Red Army. General Huang's clear political stance, to a certain extent, influenced the leaders of the Northeast Army.

When Generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Huicheng decided to force Chiang Kai-shek to resist Japan, they specially sent Huang Xiansheng to the 53rd Army stationed in Hebei as the deputy commander and commander of the 119th Division to restrain the actions of the commander, Wan Fuxin. After arriving in Shijiazhuang, Huang immediately formed the anti-Japanese backbone of the army with the 116th Division led by Lü Zhengcao, and devoted himself to the various preparations for resisting Japan. To strengthen the anti-Japanese forces, he specially invited Sun Zhiyuan as his secretary and pistol team leader, and Guo Feng as the secretary. Under his support and cover, he actively developed the organization of the Communist Party, dealing a severe blow to the Nationalist Party spies who were active in the Shijiazhuang area at that time. He also recruited a group of students and progressive youth from Beijing and Tianjin into the army, greatly enhancing the anti-Japanese atmosphere within the army. After the Xi'an Incident broke out, the Nationalist Government in Nanjing sent Gao Xibing (a CC clique member) and Huang Henghao (Huang Xiansheng's uncle) to the 53rd Army to persuade them. After buying off Wan Fuxin, they came to meet General Huang. He specially invited Liu Lanbo to debate with Gao all night, leaving the opponent speechless and fleeing back to Nanjing the next morning. To unite with the Communists to resist Japan and realize the eight proposals of the generals' remonstrance, General Huang, on the one hand, sent people to the various units of the 53rd Army and the 91st Division led by Feng Zhanhai to establish contact, and on the other hand, established a training camp in Zhengding, appointing Guo Feng as the political instructor to cultivate grassroots company and platoon cadres, absorbing some local Communist Party members in Suixi to participate, and developing revolutionary forces. Soon, Zhang Xueliang was sent to Chiang and detained, and General Huang advocated that the 53rd Army should advance south along the Jinghan Line to Zhengzhou to restrain the Nationalist Party's attack on Shaanxi forces, but this was strongly opposed by Wan Fuxin and was once detained. After the July 7th Incident broke out, he resolutely led part of the troops to fight a hard battle at the Zhang River front, severely defeating the Japanese army, but his own troops also suffered heavy losses. He then received and organized about 5,000 to 6,000 scattered troops from the front line, preparing to re-enter the battle. At that time, he accepted Zhou Enlai's invitation and went alone to Wuhan.

(III)

General Huang Xiansheng paid great attention to learning the line, policies, and principles of our party. Through his many contacts with comrades such as Zhou Enlai and Zhu De, he saw the bright future of China, which increased his confidence in the struggle for victory. He repeatedly expressed to Zhou Enlai his hope to go to Yan'an as soon as possible to participate in the anti-Japanese struggle under the direct leadership of the Communist Party of China. Zhou Enlai also once agreed to him to go to Yan'an to lead the work of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. Just four days before he was ready to set out—on February 2, 1938—he was secretly arrested by the Nationalist Party's special agents.

The Nationalist authorities charged Huang Xiansheng with "secretly communicating with the Communist Party" and "colluding with the Northeast Army to resist the central government," and imprisoned him in Wuhan, Yiyang, Xifeng in Guizhou, and the Chongqing Seminary and White House of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization until he was brutally killed just before the liberation of Chongqing.

According to survivors from the same prison, Huang Xiansheng remained upright and fearless in prison, always showing the fearless spirit of a revolutionary soldier who fights against evil and upholds justice for truth. During the trial, he openly declared that as a revolutionary soldier, actively participating in the anti-Japanese struggle was his honorable duty to the country and nation, and he did not hide his support for the Communist Party's anti-Japanese proposals. He often used the phrase "a tiger in a cage is still fierce" to encourage his fellow prisoners' courage and fight against the special agents who acted as tigers. In prison, he was the first to oppose the requirement to sign a chain of guarantees and fingerprint, making it impossible for the enemy to proceed; he also publicly criticized the compulsory study of Chiang Kai-shek's "The Destiny of China," saying that a person who betrays the country and misleads the people can write good things, and called on his fellow prisoners to refuse to study it. In the Xifeng Prison, he took advantage of his position as the head of the production team to win the support of a large number of Communist Party members and progressives to assist in the work, giving these people a small scope of activity freedom, thus forming a force to uphold justice in the prison. Some weak and sick fellow prisoners, with his help and assistance, were able to survive; some people, with his help, created conditions to escape from the hell. He was willing to stay in prison for one more day to make more comrades gain freedom and continue to participate in the revolutionary struggle.

Huang Xiansheng was very close to the Communist Party members Luo Shiven, Che Yaoxian, and Song Qiyun in prison. They often discussed the changes in the situation and the development of the people's revolutionary forces. He often expressed his longing for Yan'an and his affection for comrades such as Zhou Enlai and Zhu De; he deeply regretted the situation of General Zhang Xueliang being detained by Chiang Kai-shek in Yangming Cave, Youxian County, Guizhou (General Huang had some understanding of Zhang's situation through some relationships due to his special identity) and was particularly angry at Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal. In prison, he also did a lot of very important work. The well-known "Advance Report" inside the White House had information provided by him (he subscribed to many books, magazines, and newspapers). He persuaded several young and middle-aged Nationalist officers who were imprisoned to change their hearts and minds, and they had a new understanding of the Communist Party. After these people were released from prison, none of them continued to fight against the Communist Party, and they all led their troops to rebel and joined the people's revolutionary ranks before and after the founding of New China.

On November 27, 1949, just before the liberation of Chongqing, General Huang Xiansheng was the first to be killed in the White House in the midst of the Nationalist Party's brutal massacre. On December 25, the people of various circles in Chongqing held a memorial ceremony for the martyrs of "November 27." At that time, the leaders of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Southwest Bureau and the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping, personally went to pay their respects and gave high praise to the martyrs who had sacrificed their lives.

    怀念杰出的爱国将领黄显声将军
　　吕正操　万毅　宋黎　郭峰　黄中
    我们与爱国将领黄显声将军相识很早。他那热爱祖国、热爱人民、追求真理的革命精神，刚直不阿、坚贞不屈、视死如归的高尚情操，至今萦绕在我们的心际。
                      （一）
    1896年，黄显声出生于辽宁省凤城县，早年在北京大学念书时就积极参加五四运动，后因言论“过激”、行为“越轨”被学校开除。他毅然投笔从戎，1921年考进东北陆军讲武堂三期炮科，毕业后一直服役于东北军。1928年黄显声任东北军第一旅旅长期间，就以鲜明的爱国主义立场，支持张学良与东北亲日派作斗争，举行东北易帜，挫败日本帝国主义吞噬我东北的阴谋。
    1930年，黄显声任辽宁省警务处长兼沈阳公安局长，支持阎宝航、车向忱等爱国进步人士组织的辽宁拒毒联合会，雷厉风行地实施禁烟（鸦片）、禁赌，顶住日本领事的压力，支持群众召开万人拒毒大会，将日商偷运进来的大宗鸦片及海洛因当众焚烧。
    黄将军为了民族利益，对日本帝国主义在我国东北不断扩张阴谋尽力予以抵制，对“满铁”军警依仗日方特权滋事欺人，进行针锋相对的斗争。“九一八”事变爆发，沈阳南市、三经路等公安分局均按他的命令奋起抵抗，这是当时沈阳唯一未执行“不抵抗”命令的武装队伍。
    辽宁省政府及东北边防司令长官公署西迁锦州后，省政府代理主席米春霖及军署代理参谋长荣臻常居平津，锦州军政两署的工作实际上是由黄显声将军负责。9月下旬，他首先将所有撤退到锦州的警察公安部队和从各县征招的兵员整编为3个骑兵总队；后又制订编委民众抗日义勇军方案，计划在各县组成以警察队伍为核心的义勇军，于是有辽西八路义勇军8万人的传闻。一些在北平找张学良将军要求抗日的爱国志士，也被介绍到锦州省政府警务处，各方爱国志士前往锦州请缨抗敌者纷至沓来。黄将军与东北爱国人士阎宝航、车向忱、卢广绩等人密切联系，与在北平组织的东北民众抗日救国会大力合作，全力组织义勇军。
    1931年10至11月间，关东军司令部先后组织了凌印清、张学成（张学良堂弟）两支颇具声势
  （凌称拥兵八万，张号称十八个旅）的汉奸部队，关东军企图以他们作先锋，首先袭扰锦州，进而控制辽西，为日军长驱入关作准备。黄显声坚决地镇压了凌印清和张学成，粉碎了日寇企图以华治华的阴谋。他说：“谁投降日本当汉奸，就消灭谁。”张学良对此极为赞赏，曾在北平德国饭店接见奖励除奸有功人员，并委托黄主持锦州军政，支持其扩充地方武装，与日本侵略者进行斗争。11月末，日军第四旅团向辽西进犯，黄将军组织耿继周、项青山等几路义勇军在新民县西奋力阻击，青岗子一战，从上午9时激战至下午3时，重创日军，延缓了日军西进。接着他又致电张学良和救国会，建议迅速派人往黑龙江、吉林及辽东各地组建义勇军。宋黎、车向忱等人士与大批人员（有的携有张学良的密委令）潜行出关，分赴各地组织义勇军，使东北义勇军有新的发展。锦州失陷后，黄将军在北票指挥辽西热边一带的义勇军积极抗日。当时日伪报纸也刊登有“主张以大帮胡匪（按：指义勇军）扰乱奉天为己任之黄显声”、“黄显声所部义勇军大举袭来”、“黄显声统帅十县，民团八万名”等报道。后来，曾有人以“血肉长城第一人”来赞誉黄显声将军抗日斗争。这虽然是文学色彩的冠美之词，但从他组织义勇军的时间之早，规模之大，影响之深来看，是并不溢美的。
    1932年秋，张学良将黄显声部改编为骑兵第二师。1933年长城抗战开始不久，他率师出关，在白马关一带出击日寇，后受国民党二十五师胁迫撤回。之后，冯玉祥将军在察绥组织抗日同盟军，当时黄的部队驻怀来一带，为同盟军南部之屏障。他派人前去见冯，许以相机参加行动，支持同盟军。准备派在该师工作的共产党员刘澜波
  （刘澜波同志自“九一八”后在锦州协助黄组织义勇军，以后一直任其秘书）率一支义勇队先期开赴察绥参加行动。与此同时，他又经常将平西一带蒋军的防务状况密电同盟军，保持呼应，说服由东北退下来的义勇军首领冯占海、耿继周等人接受冯玉祥的领导，继续抗日。同盟军失败，他接受共产党的建议，再度率师挺进热河滦平、丰宁一带，但因“何梅协定”签订，再次被迫撤回，壮志未酬。
                        （二）
    在现实斗争的教育下，黄显声认识到，东北军统帅张学良在蒋介石“不抵抗”命令的束缚下，思想上矛盾重重，长此以往，不仅收复东北无望，就连东北军的前途也不堪设想。于是他通过刘澜波同志与中共北方局取得联系，先后请来孙志远、白坚、康少逸（康健生）、朱大广、刘景祜等一大批共产党员，到骑二师帮助改建部队，做好出关打游击的准备。其时，骑二师内建立了中共师工委，办了以共产党员为领导核心的教导队（刘澜波任队长，孙志远、康少逸等任教官，刘、孙以其秘书，康以师粮秣主任的公开身份从事这些工作），成立士兵委员会。在他支持下，抵制了国民党政训人员的一切反动活动，清除国民党派来的特务分子。公开进行政治宣传，教唱进步歌曲，使部队的抗日情绪极为高昂。师工委还在地方上成立夜校，发展党的组织。因此，骑二师被蒋介石、何应钦等称为“红到底”部队，视黄显声为“桀骛不驯之徒”。
    1935年秋，张学良任西北“剿总”副总司令时，委黄显声为骑兵军副军长兼参谋长。该军的建立，蒋介石本意是用来在西北“剿共”，为此，黄显声向张进言，不要上蒋介石“一石二鸟”政策的当，劝张联共抗日。他在骑兵军中毫不掩饰自己的政治倾向，坚决排除国民党特务的干扰，拒不执行蒋介石的命令，使骑兵军成为当时东北军中唯一没有和红军发生任何磨擦的部队。黄将军这种鲜明的政治态度，在一定程度上，影响着东北军的将领。
    当张学良、杨虎城两将军决定逼蒋抗日时，为防备驻河北的五十三军发生动摇，特派黄显声到该军任副军长兼一一九师师长，以牵制军长万福膦的行动。黄赴石家庄后，即和一一六师吕正操等形成该军抗日中坚，致力于实现抗日的各种准备工作。为了壮大抗日力量，特请孙志远同志作为他的书记官兼手枪队队长，郭峰同志为书记，在他的支持和掩护下，积极地发展共产党的组织，给当时在石家庄一带活动的国民党特务以严重打击。他还吸收了一批平津学生和进步青年到部队中来，使部队中的抗日气氛大增。西安事变爆发后，南京国民党政府曾派高惜冰（CC分子）和黄恒浩（黄显声叔父）到五十三军游说，他们在收买万福膦之后，就来会见黄将军，他特找来刘澜波同志与高等辩论一夜，使对方张口结舌，第二天一早跑回南京。为了联共抗日，实现张、杨兵谏的八大主张，黄将军一方面派人到五十三军各部及九十一师冯占海部进行联络，一方面在正定成立了教导营，任命郭峰为政治教官，培养基层连排骨干，吸收一部分冀南地方共产党员参加，发展革命力量。不久，张学良送蒋被扣，黄将军主张五十三军沿京汉线南下直驱郑州，以牵制国民党攻陕部队，但遭到了万福膦的激烈反对，一度被软禁。七七抗战爆发，他毅然拉出一部分队伍，在漳河前线打了一场硬仗，重创日军，自己部队也遭到重大损失，接着又收容了前线退下来的零散队伍五六千人，准备重新投入战斗。其时，他接受了周恩来同志的邀请，只身奔赴武汉。
                        （三）
    黄显声将军非常注意学习我党的路线、方针和政策。在与周恩来、朱德等同志的多次接触中，使他看到中国光明前途之所在，从而增添了斗争胜利的信心。他不止一次地向周恩来同志表示希望尽快到延安去，在中国共产党的直接领导下参加抗日斗争，周恩来同志也曾相约他到延安参加抗大的领导工作，就在他准备动身的前四天——1938年2月2日，被国民党特务秘密逮捕。
    国民党当局以黄显声“私通共产党”、“联络东北军反抗中央”等罪名，先后被关押在武汉、湖南益阳、贵州息烽及重庆中美合作所渣滓洞和白公馆，直至重庆解放前夕惨遭杀害。
    据当年同狱的幸存者介绍，黄显声在狱中仍然是一身正气一身胆，处处表现出一个革命军人不畏强暴，祛邪扶正，为坚持真理而斗争的大无畏精神。受审时他公开声称，作为一个革命军人，积极参加抗日是对国家民族履行其光荣义务，毫不掩饰对中国共产党抗日主张的拥护。他还常常以“虎入笼中威不倒”来鼓励狱友们的勇气，与为虎作伥的特务分子进行斗争，痛打“害人虫”。狱中规定要具连环保和盖印指纹，是他首先挺身反对，使敌人无法进行；狱中强制学习蒋介石的《中国之命运》，也是他公开指责：丧权误国之人能写出什么好东西来，号召狱友拒之不学。在息烽监狱，他利用自己作生产组长的有利条件，争取了一大批共产党员和进步人士出来协助工作，使这些人获得了小范围的活动自由，从而在狱中形成了一种伸张正义的势力。一些体弱多病和受难成疾的狱友，有了他的帮助和接济，才得以绝处逢生；有的人在他的协助下，创造条件，脱离了魔窟。他宁愿自己多坐一天牢而使更多的同志获得自由，继续参加革命斗争。
    黄显声在狱中与共产党员罗世文、车耀先、宋绮云等交好最深，他们常在一起讨论时局变化及人民革命力量的发展。他不时流露出对延安的向往和对周恩来、朱德等同志的眷念之情；为张学良将军被蒋介石囚于贵州修文县阳明洞的处境（黄将军以自己的特殊身分通过一些关系对张的情况有一些了解）深表痛惜，对蒋介石背信弃义尤其愤怒。他在狱中还作了许多极为重要的工作，人们所熟知的白公馆内的《挺进报》，就有他提供的消息（他订有许多书刊报纸）。他说服了几位被囚的国民党少壮将校洗心革面，对共产党产生新的认识，这些人出狱后，没有一个人再坚持与共产党为敌，在新中国成立前后先后带兵起义，投向了人民的革命阵线。
    1949年11月27日，在重庆解放前夕，在国民党反动派进行惨绝人寰的大屠杀中，黄显声将军在白公馆首先遭难。12月25日，重庆市各界人民举行了“十一·二七”死难烈士追悼大会，当时中共中央西南局和人民解放军第二野战军的领导人刘伯承、邓小平等曾亲自前往祭奠，对牺牲烈士给予高度评价。
