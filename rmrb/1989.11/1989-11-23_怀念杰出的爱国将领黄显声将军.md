We have known the patriot General Huang Xiansheng for a long time. His revolutionary spirit of loving the country, loving the people, and pursuing truth, as well as his noble character of being upright, steadfast, and fearless of death, still lingers in our hearts.

(I)

Huang Xiansheng was born in Fengcheng County, Liaoning Province, in 1896. During his studies at Peking University, he actively participated in the May Fourth Movement. Later, due to his "radical" speeches and "unconventional" behavior, he was expelled from the school. He then resolutely took up arms, enrolling in the third class of the Artillery Department at the Northeastern Military Academy in 1921. After graduating, he served continuously in the Northeastern Army. During his tenure as the commander of the First Brigade of the Northeastern Army in 1928, he took a clear patriotic stance, supporting Zhang Xueliang in his struggle against the pro-Japanese faction in the Northeast, and carrying out the Northeast Flag Change, thwarting Japan's imperialist plot to annex the Northeast.

In 1930, Huang Xiansheng served as the director of the Liaoning Public Security Bureau and the chief of the Shenyang Public Security Bureau. He supported Yans Baohang, Che Xiangqin, and other patriotic progressives in organizing the Liaoning Anti-Opiate Union, implementing strict anti-opium (opium) and anti-gambling measures, and resisting pressure from the Japanese consul. He supported the people in holding a mass anti-opiate rally, publicly burning large quantities of opium and heroin smuggled in by Japanese merchants.

General Huang, for the sake of national interests, strongly resisted the continuous expansion of Japanese imperialism in Northeast China. He fought back against the "South Manchuria Railway" military police who took advantage of Japanese privileges to cause trouble and bully people. When the "September 18 Incident" broke out, the public security sub-bureaus in the southern part of Shenyang and Sanjing Road all followed his orders to resist, making them the only armed forces in Shenyang at that time that did not carry out the "non-resistance" order.

After the Liaoning Provincial Government and the Northeast Border Defense Command Headquarters moved to Jinzhou, the acting chairman of the provincial government, Mi Chunlin, and the acting chief of staff, Rong Zhen, often resided in Beijing and Tianjin. The work of the military and political departments in Jinzhou was actually managed by General Huang Xiansheng. In late September, he first reorganized all the police and public security forces that had retreated to Jinzhou, as well as the soldiers recruited from various counties, into three cavalry brigades. Later, he drafted a plan to organize the people's anti-Japanese volunteer army, aiming to form volunteer armies with the police forces as the core in various counties. Thus, there was a rumor of 80,000 volunteer armies in Liaoxi. Some patriotic figures in Beijing who sought Zhang Xueliang to resist Japan were also introduced to the Jinzhou Provincial Government Public Security Bureau. Patriots from all sides flocked to Jinzhou to volunteer for the anti-Japanese war. General Huang maintained close contact with Northeast patriots such as Yans Baohang, Che Xiangqin, and Lu Guangji, and cooperated closely with the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese Salvation Association organized in Beijing. He devoted himself to organizing the volunteer army.

From October to November 1931, the Kwantung Army headquarters organized two large-scale traitor forces led by Ling Yincheng and Zhang Xuecheng (Zhang Xueliang's cousin), aiming to use them as vanguards to first attack Jinzhou, then control Liaoxi, and prepare for the Japanese army's advance into the interior. Huang Xiansheng resolutely suppressed Ling Yincheng and Zhang Xuecheng, foiling the enemy's plot to use Chinese to control Chinese. He said, "Anyone who surrenders to Japan to become a traitor will be eliminated." Zhang Xueliang highly praised this and once received and rewarded those who had meritorious service in eliminating traitors at the German Restaurant in Beijing. He then entrusted Huang to manage the military and political affairs in Jinzhou, supporting the expansion of local armed forces to fight against Japanese invaders. At the end of November, the Fourth Brigade of the Japanese Army invaded Liaoxi. General Huang organized several volunteer armies led by Geng Jizhou and Xiang Qingshan to fiercely resist in the western part of Xinmin County. The battle of Qinggangzi lasted from 9 AM to 3 PM, severely defeating the Japanese army and delaying their westward advance. He then sent a telegram to Zhang Xueliang and the Salvation Association, suggesting that they quickly send people to Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaodong to organize volunteer armies. Song Li, Che Xiangqin, and other figures, along with a large number of people (some with Zhang Xueliang's secret orders), secretly left the pass and went to various places to organize volunteer armies, giving the Northeast volunteer army new development. After Jinzhou fell, General Huang commanded the volunteer armies in the Liaoxi Hotian area to actively resist Japan. At that time, the Japanese puppet newspapers also published reports such as "Huang Xiansheng, who takes it upon himself to disturb Fengtian with a large group of bandits (referring to the volunteer army)," "Huang Xiansheng's volunteer army is launching a large-scale attack," and "Huang Xiansheng commands ten counties, with 80,000 militia." Later, someone praised Huang Xiansheng as the "first person of the Great Wall of flesh and blood" for his anti-Japanese struggle. Although this is a literary compliment, considering the early organization of the volunteer army, its large scale, and deep influence, it is not an exaggeration.

In the autumn of 1932, Zhang Xueliang reorganized Huang Xiansheng's troops into the Second Cavalry Division. In early 1933, during the Long March on the Great Wall, he led the division to attack the enemy in the Baima Pass area and later withdrew under the pressure of the Nationalist 25th Division. Later, General Feng Yuxiang organized the Anti-Japanese Allied Army in Chahar and Suiyuan. At that time, Huang's troops were stationed in the Huairou area, serving as a barrier for the southern part of the Allied Army. He sent people to meet Feng, agreeing to participate in the action at an appropriate time and support the Allied Army. He prepared to send Liu Lanbo (Liu Lanbo, who had been assisting Huang in organizing the volunteer army in Jinzhou since the "September 18 Incident," and had been serving as his secretary ever since) to lead a volunteer team to advance to Chahar and Suiyuan to participate in the action. At the same time, he often sent secret telegrams about the defense situation of the Nationalist troops in the Pingxi area to the Allied Army, maintaining coordination, and persuaded the leaders of the volunteer armies who had retreated from the Northeast, such as Feng Zhanhai and Geng Jizhou, to accept Feng Yuxiang's leadership and continue to resist Japan. After the failure of the Allied Army, he accepted the suggestion of the Communist Party and led the division to advance into Rehe, Luanping, and Fengning. However, due to the signing of the "He-Mei Agreement," he was forced to withdraw again, leaving his ambitions unfulfilled.

(II)

Under the education of practical struggles, Huang Xiansheng realized that Zhang Xueliang, the commander of the Northeast Army, was bound by Chiang Kai-shek's "non-resistance" order, with many contradictions in his thoughts. If this continued, not only would the recovery of the Northeast be hopeless, but the future of the Northeast Army would also be bleak. Therefore, he contacted the North China Bureau of the Communist Party through Liu Lanbo and invited Sun Zhiyuan, Bai Jian, Kang Shaoyi (Kang Jiansheng), Zhu Dagang, and Liu Jinghu, a group of Communist Party members, to the Second Cavalry Division to help rebuild the troops and prepare to go out and fight guerrilla warfare. At that time, the Communist Party's divisional committee was established within the Second Cavalry Division, and a training team led by Communist Party members was set up (Liu Lanbo served as the team leader, Sun Zhiyuan and Kang Shaoyi as instructors, and Liu and Sun as secretaries, while Kang served as the division's quartermaster in public). Soldiers' committees were also established. With his support, he resisted all reactionary activities of the Nationalist Party's political training personnel and eliminated the spy elements sent by the Nationalist Party. He openly carried out political propaganda, taught progressive songs, and made the troops' anti-Japanese sentiment very high. The divisional committee also established night schools in the local area and developed the party's organization. Therefore, the Second Cavalry Division was called a "red to the core" division by Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin, who regarded Huang Xiansheng as a "rebellious and unruly person."

In the autumn of 1935, when Zhang Xueliang served as the deputy commander-in-chief of the Northwest "Extermination" Headquarters, he appointed Huang Xiansheng as the deputy commander and chief of staff of the Cavalry Army. The establishment of this army was originally intended by Chiang Kai-shek to be used to "exterminate" the Communists in the Northwest. Therefore, Huang Xiansheng advised Zhang not to fall into Chiang Kai-shek's "two birds with one stone" policy and persuaded Zhang to unite with the Communists to resist Japan. He did not hide his political inclinations in the Cavalry Army, resolutely expelled the interference of Nationalist Party spies, and refused to carry out Chiang Kai-shek's orders, making the Cavalry Army the only division in the Northeast Army at that time that had no friction with the Red Army. General Huang's clear political stance, to a certain extent, influenced the leaders of the Northeast Army.

When Generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Huicheng decided to force Chiang Kai-shek to resist Japan, they specially sent Huang Xiansheng to the 53rd Army stationed in Hebei as the deputy commander and commander of the 119th Division to restrain the actions of the commander, Wan Fuxin. After arriving in Shijiazhuang, Huang immediately formed the anti-Japanese backbone of the army with the 116th Division led by LÃ¼ Zhengcao, and devoted himself to the various preparations for resisting Japan. To strengthen the anti-Japanese forces, he specially invited Sun Zhiyuan as his secretary and pistol team leader, and Guo Feng as the secretary. Under his support and cover, he actively developed the organization of the Communist Party, dealing a severe blow to the Nationalist Party spies who were active in the Shijiazhuang area at that time. He also recruited a group of students and progressive youth from Beijing and Tianjin into the army, greatly enhancing the anti-Japanese atmosphere within the army. After the Xi'an Incident broke out, the Nationalist Government in Nanjing sent Gao Xibing (a CC clique member) and Huang Henghao (Huang Xiansheng's uncle) to the 53rd Army to persuade them. After buying off Wan Fuxin, they came to meet General Huang. He specially invited Liu Lanbo to debate with Gao all night, leaving the opponent speechless and fleeing back to Nanjing the next morning. To unite with the Communists to resist Japan and realize the eight proposals of the generals' remonstrance, General Huang, on the one hand, sent people to the various units of the 53rd Army and the 91st Division led by Feng Zhanhai to establish contact, and on the other hand, established a training camp in Zhengding, appointing Guo Feng as the political instructor to cultivate grassroots company and platoon cadres, absorbing some local Communist Party members in Suixi to participate, and developing revolutionary forces. Soon, Zhang Xueliang was sent to Chiang and detained, and General Huang advocated that the 53rd Army should advance south along the Jinghan Line to Zhengzhou to restrain the Nationalist Party's attack on Shaanxi forces, but this was strongly opposed by Wan Fuxin and was once detained. After the July 7th Incident broke out, he resolutely led part of the troops to fight a hard battle at the Zhang River front, severely defeating the Japanese army, but his own troops also suffered heavy losses. He then received and organized about 5,000 to 6,000 scattered troops from the front line, preparing to re-enter the battle. At that time, he accepted Zhou Enlai's invitation and went alone to Wuhan.

General Huang Xiansheng paid great attention to learning the line, policies, and principles of our party. Through his many contacts with comrades such as Zhou Enlai and Zhu De, he saw the bright future of China, which increased his confidence in the struggle for victory. He repeatedly expressed to Zhou Enlai his hope to go to Yan'an as soon as possible to participate in the anti-Japanese struggle under the direct leadership of the Communist Party of China. Zhou Enlai also once agreed to him to go to Yan'an to lead the work of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. Just four days before he was ready to set outâon February 2, 1938âhe was secretly arrested by the Nationalist Party's special agents.

The Nationalist authorities charged Huang Xiansheng with "secretly communicating with the Communist Party" and "colluding with the Northeast Army to resist the central government," and imprisoned him in Wuhan, Yiyang, Xifeng in Guizhou, and the Chongqing Seminary and White House of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization until he was brutally killed just before the liberation of Chongqing.

According to survivors from the same prison, Huang Xiansheng remained upright and fearless in prison, always showing the fearless spirit of a revolutionary soldier who fights against evil and upholds justice for truth. During the trial, he openly declared that as a revolutionary soldier, actively participating in the anti-Japanese struggle was his honorable duty to the country and nation, and he did not hide his support for the Communist Party's anti-Japanese proposals. He often used the phrase "a tiger in a cage is still fierce" to encourage his fellow prisoners' courage and fight against the special agents who acted as tigers. In prison, he was the first to oppose the requirement to sign a chain of guarantees and fingerprint, making it impossible for the enemy to proceed; he also publicly criticized the compulsory study of Chiang Kai-shek's "The Destiny of China," saying that a person who betrays the country and misleads the people can write good things, and called on his fellow prisoners to refuse to study it. In the Xifeng Prison, he took advantage of his position as the head of the production team to win the support of a large number of Communist Party members and progressives to assist in the work, giving these people a small scope of activity freedom, thus forming a force to uphold justice in the prison. Some weak and sick fellow prisoners, with his help and assistance, were able to survive; some people, with his help, created conditions to escape from the hell. He was willing to stay in prison for one more day to make more comrades gain freedom and continue to participate in the revolutionary struggle.

Huang Xiansheng was very close to the Communist Party members Luo Shiven, Che Yaoxian, and Song Qiyun in prison. They often discussed the changes in the situation and the development of the people's revolutionary forces. He often expressed his longing for Yan'an and his affection for comrades such as Zhou Enlai and Zhu De; he deeply regretted the situation of General Zhang Xueliang being detained by Chiang Kai-shek in Yangming Cave, Youxian County, Guizhou (General Huang had some understanding of Zhang's situation through some relationships due to his special identity) and was particularly angry at Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal. In prison, he also did a lot of very important work. The well-known "Advance Report" inside the White House had information provided by him (he subscribed to many books, magazines, and newspapers). He persuaded several young and middle-aged Nationalist officers who were imprisoned to change their hearts and minds, and they had a new understanding of the Communist Party. After these people were released from prison, none of them continued to fight against the Communist Party, and they all led their troops to rebel and joined the people's revolutionary ranks before and after the founding of New China.

On November 27, 1949, just before the liberation of Chongqing, General Huang Xiansheng was the first to be killed in the White House in the midst of the Nationalist Party's brutal massacre. On December 25, the people of various circles in Chongqing held a memorial ceremony for the martyrs of "November 27." At that time, the leaders of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Southwest Bureau and the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping, personally went to pay their respects and gave high praise to the martyrs who had sacrificed their lives.
