Eating coarse grains, which seems unworthy of praise for Chinese people who prefer refined food, is actually undergoing subtle changes. A series of phenomena and statistics indicate that the proportion of coarse and fine grains in the urban residents' grain consumption is changing.

According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal Grain Bureau, in the first half of this year, the sales of coarse grains to urban residents in the entire city increased by 45% compared to the same period last year, with corn flour sales increasing by 44%. Meanwhile, the sales of refined flour and rice decreased by 21% and 5%, respectively. Long queues form daily in front of the city's only two corn flour processing plants.

For southerners who primarily eat rice, flour has traditionally been considered a "coarse grain." Recently, a reporter learned from the Shanghai Municipal Grain Bureau that the proportion of flour products in Shanghai residents' grain consumption is increasing.

According to relevant experts, the change in the proportion of coarse and fine grains in residents' grain consumption is related to the updating of grain consumption concepts. This also indicates that the previous trend of pursuing overly refined and fine grains in food consumption has started to reverse.

    食不厌精正在悄悄变化
    吃粗粮，对于食不厌精的中国人来说似乎不是值得夸耀的事。但是，一系列现象和数字表明，城镇居民口粮消费中粗与细的比例正发生微妙的变化。
    据北京市粮食局统计，今年上半年对全市城镇居民口粮销售，杂粮销售量比去年同期增长了45％，其中玉米面销售量增长了44％。而精粉和大米的销售量分别下降了21％和5％。全市仅有的两个玉米面加工厂门前天天排起了长队。
    对于以大米为主食的南方人来说，面粉在习惯上从来都被当作“粗粮”。前不久，记者从上海市粮食局获悉，面制品在上海市居民的口粮中所占比重已越来越大。
    据有关人士分析，居民口粮消费中粗细的变化与粮食消费观念的更新有关，这也表明，前段时间在粮食消费上片面求精、求细的风气已有所扭转。
