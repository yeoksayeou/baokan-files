Upon hearing about the cancellation of invigilation, the students in the first year of high school almost cheered.

This semester, during the mid-term exams, Beijing No. 1 Middle School conducted an experiment: no invigilators were present for any of the subject exams.

The school explained to the students in the first-year assembly: the cancellation of invigilation is based on trust in the students; the absence of teachers as invigilators is to let the students cherish their dignity and self-invigilate. This exam is not just about subjects, but also about character. A score of 59 with a clear conscience is more valuable than a score of 95 obtained through cheating. Having entered high school, one should have a higher level of ideological awareness and self-discipline. From the first high school exam, one should establish a solid and genuine foundation of knowledge.

Class teachers and the Youth League held separate meetings with student leaders and all league members. After explaining the significance of the exam and the harm of cheating, the idea of canceling invigilation was welcomed and understood by the students, who all promised not to cheat.

On November 9, the first exam began.

The exam room was unusually quiet, with only the sound of students writing quickly.

Replacing the invigilators were eight large characters on the blackboard: Self-respect and Self-love, Seek Truth and Be Honest.

Behind the classroom, there was also a couplet:
Reporting results without being a contemporary plagiarist, taking the exam honestly as a person of today.

The class teachers and chief invigilators of the first-year classes all sat in the office far from the exam room. One class teacher half-jokingly said, “It’s like sitting on pins and needles!”

From time to time, one or two teachers would go to the exam room to take a quick look. They were not there to invigilate, but to see what the exam room would be like without invigilators. This batch of first-year students is about half from the school's own junior high, and their academic performance and discipline were not very ideal during junior high. Now, with the cancellation of invigilation, could cheating be completely eliminated? Could exam discipline be maintained? The teachers had some concerns...

The three-day, six-exam period passed smoothly, with normal conditions and good discipline. The teachers breathed a sigh of relief!

According to the feedback from various subject teachers, the students' exam scores were consistent with their usual performance, meaning the scores were credible. The physics teacher said, “In the physics exam, five students failed, and one got 59 points; if they cheated, how could they not pass?”

The students' reactions were also enthusiastic.

One student said, “This is the first and most interesting exam in my nine years of schooling. The entire exam process, with no teachers invigilating, felt like a big breakthrough.” Her views were quite representative.

The students summarized their feelings about this exam into four points: First, relaxed, eliminating the tension from being invigilated by teachers in the past; second, restrained, without anyone invigilating, even the thought of cheating felt embarrassing, preferring to lose a few points rather than shamelessly cheat, with exam discipline even better than when there were invigilators; third, refreshing, although the exam was over, the scores were genuine, and the heart was unburdened, feeling very refreshing; fourth, innovative, previously always feeling that the school's educational methods were rigid, now feeling that the methods have been updated, and the school is bold in exploring.

After investigation, it was found that cheating during this exam was not completely eliminated, but the situation had significantly improved. Both teachers and students said that if this practice continued, the next time would definitely be better than this time.

Beijing No. 1 Middle School was designated as the experimental school for the Dongcheng District Educational Research Center in early 1989. The cancellation of invigilation in the first-year classes is just one of their many reform experiments. But this small reform contains profound significance. As the school principal said, “All the school's work is education; exams should become an education in cultivating students' sense of personal dignity.”

　　自尊自重　求实求是
　　——记北京一中取消监考的试验
　　王晋堂
    听说取消监考，高一的学生几乎欢呼起来。
    本学期期中考试时，北京一中搞了一项试验：各门课程考试均不设监考老师。
    学校在高一年级会上向学生讲明：取消监考一举，是建立在对学生信任的基础上的；老师不来监考，是让学生珍重人格，自己来监考。这次考试，不仅是学科的考试，而且是人格的考试。问心无愧的59分比抄来的95分要宝贵。上了高中，应该有较高的思想觉悟和自制能力。从高中第一次考试起，就应该使自己的学习有一个扎实与真实的知识基础。
    各班班主任老师分别召开学生干部会；团组织又召开了全体团员会……在讲明考试的意义和作弊的危害之后，取消监考的设想赢得了学生的欢迎和理解，大家纷纷保证不作弊。
    11月9日，第一场考试开场了。
    考场显得格外安静，只听见学生伏案疾书的沙沙声。
    代替监考老师的是黑板上的8个大字：自尊自爱、求实求真。
    在教室后面，还有一副对联：
    汇报成绩不做当代文抄公，考试人生要做今日老实人。
    高一年级的班主任和主考老师都坐在远离考场的办公室里。一位班主任半开玩笑地说：“真是如坐针毡呀！”
    不时有一两位老师到考场溜上一眼。他们不是来监考，而是想看看：没有监考老师的考场会是个什么样子。这届高一学生约一半是由本校初中升上来的，而他们上初中时，学习与纪律情况并不很理想，现在取消监考，作弊现象能否杜绝？考场纪律能否维持？老师们不无顾虑……
    3天共6场考试平安地过去了，情况正常、纪律良好，老师们松了一口气！
    据各科教师反映，学生考试成绩与平时水平相符，也就是说，成绩是可信的。物理老师说：“物理考试有5个学生不及格，有一个得了59分；要是抄，怎么也能及格呀？”
    学生的反映也很热烈。
    一位学生说：“这是我上学9年以来第一次、也是最有趣的一次考试。整个考试过程没有老师监考，我觉得是一个非常大的突破”，她的这种看法很有代表性。
    学生把这次考试的体会概括成以下4点：一、轻松，消除了过去在老师监考下的紧张感；二、收敛，由于没有人监考，动一动抄的念头都觉得不好意思，宁可少得几分，也不厚着脸皮去作弊，考场纪律比有监考时还好；三、痛快，以往虽然考完了，由于成绩不真实，心里总有什么东西堵着似的，现在成绩真实，心情舒畅，十分痛快；四、有新意，以往总觉得学校教育方法很死板，这次感到方法更新了，学校是勇于探索的。
    经过调查了解，这次考试作弊现象还没有完全杜绝，但是情况大有进步。老师和学生都说，如果坚持做下去，下次一定会比这次还好。
    北京一中今年年初被定为北京市东城区教研科研中心实验校，在高一年级取消监考只是他们诸项改革实验中的一个小插曲。但这小小的改革，蕴含着深刻的意义。正如该校校长所说：“学校的一切工作都是教育；考试应成为培养学生人格尊严的教育。”
