Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, November 3rd. Correspondent Liu Kai Chen reports: The United Nations Security Council today expressed regret over South Africa's fabrication of news on November 1st, accusing the People's Liberation Army of Southwest Africa of crossing the Angola-Namibia border.

South African Foreign Minister R. F. Botha claimed on November 1st that the South African government had intercepted a telegram indicating that the SWAPO guerrillas had infiltrated into Namibia and threatened that the South African military was prepared to take action. In fact, this telegram was forged. For this reason, the 15 members of the Security Council held consultations today, and the Security Council Chairman, Li Lu Ye, issued a statement on this matter.

The statement pointed out that the Security Council is deeply concerned about this incident and its potential impact on Namibia's independence elections, and therefore urges South Africa not to take any further actions of this kind.

The statement also said, "The Security Council strongly praises the United Nations Transition Assistance Group for immediately taking action to clarify the situation and verify that South Africa's allegations are groundless."

The Security Council finally urged the relevant parties to fulfill their commitments and fully implement the plan for Namibia's independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Gaborone, November 3rd. The defense ministers of the six frontline states of Southern Africa today refuted South Africa's accusation that the People's Liberation Army of Southwest Africa was preparing to enter Namibia to disrupt the upcoming United Nations-supervised pre-independence elections.

The defense and security ministers of the six frontline states held a two-day meeting here to discuss the security situation in Southern Africa. After the meeting, the ministers issued a statement pointing out that South Africa's true intention is to wage a psychological war against the liberation organization led by Nujoma, in order to find an excuse to sabotage and manipulate next week's elections in Namibia.

The ministers of the frontline states praised the People's Liberation Army of Southwest Africa for exercising the greatest restraint.

According to another report, the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity, Salim, also refuted the South African authorities' accusations against the People's Liberation Army of Southwest Africa, calling it an "unacceptable fabrication."

    安理会主席发表声明
    对南非编造谣言表示遗憾
    非洲前线国家驳斥南非指责
    本报联合国11月3日电　记者刘开宸报道：联合国安理会今天对南非在11月1日编造消息，指责西南非洲人民组织部队越过安哥拉—纳米比亚边界一事，表示遗憾。
    南非外长鲁洛夫·博塔1日宣称南非政府截获电报，表明人组游击队已从安哥拉渗入纳米比亚境内，并威胁说南非军队准备采取行动。实际上，此电报是伪造的。为此，安理会全体15个理事国代表今天举行磋商会，并由安理会本月主席李鹿野就此事发表声明。
    声明指出，安理会对此事及其对纳米比亚独立选举可能产生的影响深为关切，因此要求南非不要再采取任何此种行动。
    声明还说，“安理会大力赞扬联合国过渡时期援助团立即采取行动，澄清情况，证实南非的这些指控毫无根据”。
    安理会最后要求有关各方遵守承诺，充分执行纳米比亚独立计划。
    新华社哈博罗内11月3日电　南部非洲前线国家的国防部长今天驳斥南非提出的所谓西南非洲人民组织的部队正准备进入纳米比亚，以破坏即将举行的由联合国监督的独立前选举的指责。
    前线国家6国国防和安全部长在这里举行了两天的会议，讨论南部非洲的安全形势。会后，部长们发表一项公报指出，南非的真正目的是对由努乔马领导的解放组织打一场心理战，为破坏和操纵下星期举行的纳米比亚选举找借口。
    前线国家部长赞扬西南非洲人民组织进行了最大的克制。
    另据报道，非洲统一组织秘书长萨利姆今天也驳斥了南非当局对西南非洲人民组织的指责，称这是“不能容忍的捏造”。
