To commemorate the 60th anniversary of the discovery of the first skullcap of Peking Man and to strengthen international academic exchanges in paleoanthropology, nearly 100 experts and scholars from more than ten countries and regions, including China, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Federal Republic of Germany, recently held a week-long international academic conference on paleoanthropology in Fangshan District, on the outskirts of Beijing.

At this conference, hosted by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 78 papers were presented, and new archaeological discoveries and research findings in paleoanthropology from the participating countries were exchanged.

In recent years, China has made significant achievements in the study of Zhoukoudian and paleoanthropology. Currently, China is recognized worldwide as a country rich in hominid fossils. Before liberation, there was only one site discovered, but now there are ten. Before liberation, there were no early Homo sapiens fossil sites discovered, but now there are more than nine. China has discovered more than 150 important Paleolithic cultural sites. The Zhoukoudian Site of Peking Man was listed as one of China's six World Cultural Heritage Sites by the United Nations last year.
