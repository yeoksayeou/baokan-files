	Who executes the decision after the public security bureau makes a traffic accident determination?

	Question: Three years ago, I was knocked down by a student on a bicycle, resulting in a fracture of my right femur and tibia, and my right leg is now disabled.

	After the accident, the public security department made a decision according to the law: the guardian of that middle school student should compensate me for part of the hospitalization, nursing, and nutrition expenses incurred due to the injury, totaling nearly 600 yuan, but the other party has not compensated me yet.

	After the public security bureau makes a decision on a traffic accident according to the law, who should execute it?

	Guangxi Guilin City Second Food Company	Guo Wenlin

	Answer: After a traffic accident occurs, the traffic management department of the public security bureau should determine the amount of economic compensation based on the degree of responsibility of the parties involved. The method of determination is for the accident handling agency to convene the parties involved and relevant units to negotiate and resolve the issue. If negotiations fail, the accident handling agency will make a ruling. Once the traffic accident is ruled upon, the relevant parties must sign the case closure document and execute it. If the ruling on the accident handling is not accepted, an appeal can be made to the higher-level accident handling agency within 7 days from the date of the ruling. If no appeal is made within the time limit, the ruling will be finalized as the case closure.

	From Guo Wenlin's letter, it can be seen that the guardian of that student has not raised any objections to the handling decision of the traffic management department of the public security bureau. Therefore, it should be executed according to the law. The traffic management department of the public security bureau should also actively do the work of the responsible party to ensure that the content of the decision is fulfilled. If the responsible party refuses to execute the decision of the public security management agency, the victim can file a lawsuit with the people's court, and the people's court will enforce it.

　　公安机关作出交通事故决定后由谁执行？
    问：3年前，我被一个学生骑车撞倒，致右股骨胫骨骨折，右腿现已残废。
    事故发生后，经公安部门依法作出决定：由那个中学生的监护人赔偿我伤后部分住院、护理、营养等费近600元，但至今对方还未赔偿。
    公安机关依法对交通事故作了处理决定后，应由谁来执行？
    广西桂林市第二副食公司　郭文林
    答：交通事故发生后，公安交通管理机关应根据当事人所负责任的大小确定经济补偿的数额，确定的方式由事故处理机关召集当事人和有关的单位协商解决。协商不成的，由事故处理机关裁定。交通事故一经裁定，有关各方须在结案书上签字执行。对事故处理的裁定不服的，可在裁定之日起7日内向上一级事故处理机关申请复议，逾期未申请复议，即以裁定作为结案终止。从郭文林同志的来信看，那个学生的监护人对公安交通机关的处理决定没有提出异议，因此，应该依法当即执行。公安交通机关也应该积极做好责任方的工作，使决定的内容能够兑现。如果责任方拒不履行公安管理机关决定，受害人可以向人民法院提起诉讼，由人民法院强制执行。
