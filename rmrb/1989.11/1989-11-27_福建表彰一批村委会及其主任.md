Fujian Honors a Batch of Village Committees and Their Directors

According to Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 26th — (Reporter Xiao Lun Tian) Fujian Province has honored 53 village committees that directly convey the Party's line, principles, and policies to the masses, deliver the Party and government's care to every household, and ensure that all work is carried out effectively. Additionally, 101 village committee directors who are dedicated to serving the people, uphold integrity, do not seek personal gain, and work tirelessly have been commended at a recent provincial village committee work conference. Twenty advanced village committees shared their experiences in strengthening grassroots governance.

Since the promulgation of the "Village Committee Organization Law" in June last year, 98.2% of the village committees in Fujian Province have completed their term elections, marking a significant step in village self-governance. A large number of village cadres and committees elected by the villagers have worked hard to provide services for villagers' production and life, solve urgent and difficult problems, and strengthen the relationship between the Party and the people. However, there are still many village-level collective economies that are relatively weak, and some village committees are in a state of disintegration or semi-disintegration.

　　福建表彰一批村委会及其主任
    据新华社福州11月26日电　（记者肖伦添）福建省53个把党的路线、方针、政策直接交给群众，把党和政府的关怀送到千家万户，把各项工作落到实处的村委会，101位热心为群众办事、廉洁奉公、不谋私利、任劳任怨的村委会主任，在近日召开的全省村委会工作会议上受到省人民政府的表彰。20个先进村委会介绍了加强基层政权建设的经验。
    去年6月《村民委员会组织法》颁布后，福建省98.2％的村委会完成了换届选举，村民自治活动迈出了重要的一步。一大批由村民选举产生的村干部和村委会，努力为村民的生产和生活提供服务，解决村民的急难问题，密切了党群关系。但全省仍有相当多的村级集体经济比较薄弱，有些村委会还处于涣散、半涣散状态。
