Vice Minister Chen Yaobang of the Ministry of Agriculture emphasized that township enterprises must prioritize safety production to ensure healthy development. According to Xinhua News Agency, Chen Yaobang recently stated at a national conference on safety production management for township enterprises in Chengdu that while various levels of government have paid attention to and strengthened the leadership of safety production in township enterprises, resulting in a reduction in accidents in many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, there are still significant safety production issues. For instance, in some provinces, the number of accidents involving three or more deaths has increased by 75% compared to the same period last year, with the number of deaths doubling. In another province, township enterprises accounted for 71% of the major accidents and 47% of the total deaths in the province.

Chen Yaobang stressed the need for high attention to safety production in township enterprises and the necessity of rectifying and improving the safety production order. He demanded that local authorities strengthen the safety management network, replenish personnel, and establish and improve safety management institutions. He also emphasized the importance of strengthening target management and implementing the safety responsibility system. The departments in charge of township enterprises must have a deputy in charge of safety production work. Everyone in the enterprise should be responsible for safety production. Safety production in township enterprises should be strictly managed according to the law, with everything done according to regulations. Long-term and persistent safety education should be conducted for township enterprise employees, and systematic training should be provided for various levels of cadres in the township enterprise system over a period of three years or more.

    农业部副部长陈耀邦强调
    乡镇企业必须搞好安全生产
    据新华社成都11月3日电　（记者王毅）农业部副部长陈耀邦最近在成都召开的全国乡镇企业安全生产管理工作会上强调指出，乡镇企业必须搞好安全生产，促其健康发展。陈耀邦说，近几年，在各级政府的关注下，各地加强了对乡镇企业的安全生产的领导，许多省、市、自治区乡镇企业的事故已有所下降。但是，由于种种原因，当前，乡镇企业的安全生产问题还相当多。今年上半年，有的省一次死亡在3人以上的事故就比去年同期上升75％，死亡数增加了1倍；有的省的乡镇企业发生的特大事故和因此死亡的人数占到了这个省特大事故的71％和死亡总人数的47％。
    陈耀邦强调，必须高度重视乡镇企业安全生产问题，必须治理整顿其安全生产秩序。他要求，各地要强化安全管理网络，充实人员，首先要建立健全安全管理机构；强化目标管理，落实安全责任制，乡镇企业主管部门，一定要有一位副职具体管安全生产工作；企业里安全生产人人有责；乡镇企业的安全生产要依法从严管理，一切照章办事；要持之以恒地对乡镇企业职工进行安全教育，用3年以上的时间对乡镇企业系统的各级干部进行岗位培训。
