The decision made by the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on furthering the rectification and deepening reform is a major strategic decision for China's economic development and reform in a new stage. Continuing to firmly implement the policy of rectification and deepening reform is the fundamental way to overcome current economic difficulties and achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy.

Since September of last year, the Party and the government have taken a series of extraordinary measures, including freezing the prices of some products and using increased fiscal subsidies to stabilize the prices of essential goods for residents' basic living needs; imposing maximum prices on important production materials that were previously deregulated; breaking down the annual price increase rate to local levels for "contracting," which to some extent encouraged local protectionism; implementing monopoly operations on some scarce important production materials and consumer goods such as fertilizers, pesticides, grains, cotton, and four types of steel; implementing unified procurement for some important agricultural raw materials such as silkworm cocoons and tobacco leaves; closing some product markets for a period of time; strengthening control over the supply of funds and the total amount of wages, and so on. These measures have caused some people to doubt the necessity and correctness of rectification. In fact, these situations are only short-term and local phenomena. As rectification deepens, to truly achieve the goals of rectification, in addition to strengthening direct administrative control in certain periods, especially in the initial stages and local areas, it is more important to promote and deepen reforms in many important aspects, using reform to promote and ensure the implementation of rectification tasks.

An important aspect of rectifying the economic environment is to control inflation and curb excessive price increases. For this purpose, administrative measures are initially needed to freeze or semi-freeze the prices of some most important commodities and services. However, this method is limited in time and mainly buys time to cool down the overheated economy and rebalance the relationship between social total supply and total demand. To fundamentally solve the problem of repeated economic overheating and ensure the stable development of the national economy, it is necessary to reform the economic operation mechanism, starting with the reform of the macro-control mechanism to establish a relatively reasonable macro-control system that promotes stable economic development. From this point of view, I believe that to support rectification, it is necessary to promote the reform of the financial system, strengthen the macro-control functions of the central bank, strictly control the issuance of currency and the total scale of credit; change the long-term practice of monetary policy being subordinate to fiscal policy, and enable the central bank to exercise its monetary policy relatively independently. This reform to control the "main valve" of excessive currency issuance does not cost money and is beneficial for controlling inflation. This reform, combined with efforts to curb demand inflation, can address the root cause and control inflation. The annual monetary supply growth plan formulated by the central bank should have sufficient economic basis and firmly reject the policy of using excessive currency supply to support high-speed economic growth. Credit total scale should be controlled, and a tight credit policy should be implemented, while adjusting and improving the credit structure to better use credit tools to implement the state's industrial policy.

In the process of reforming the macro-control mechanism, the use of interest rate tools will become increasingly important. In a planned commodity economy, the interest rate is an important lever for macro-control. The interest rate is the price of funds, and changes in the interest rate should be able to sensitively reflect and adjust the supply and demand relationship of funds, promoting economic expansion (lowering interest rates) or contraction (raising interest rates). To curb the overheated economic state, it is necessary to appropriately raise interest rates, which has been proven to be an effective method by the experience of various countries. Therefore, the several interest rate hikes in China since last year, as well as the implementation of savings protection, should be affirmed. These measures have played a good role in stabilizing the market and finance. As for the role of raising deposit interest rates in encouraging savings, it is evident to all. After the deposit interest rate is raised, the loan interest rate should also be raised accordingly, which helps to cool down the economy, curb investment heat, and eliminate low-efficiency production and operation. At the same time, the state can use fiscal subsidies and other methods to encourage investment in short-term product production and improve the industrial structure.

To strengthen macro-control, the fiscal and tax system also needs to be further reformed. During the rectification period, it is necessary to quickly establish a dual-budget system that separates regular expenditures and investment expenditures, and establish a fiscal policy financing system. The comprehensive implementation of local fiscal contracting in 1988 has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are that it can mobilize the enthusiasm of local governments to develop the economy and increase fiscal revenue, while the disadvantages are mainly that it strengthens local interests and weakens the central government's macro-control capabilities. Under the local fiscal contracting system, various places, starting from their own interests, compete to build short-term and quick-return projects, leading to rapid investment expansion, serious duplication of construction, similar economic structures in various places, declining resource allocation efficiency, and obstacles to the state's efforts to adjust and improve the economic structure, with the imbalance between basic industries and processing industries becoming more severe; regional blockades and market segmentation hinder the formation of a national unified market; hoarding and price hikes of raw materials, and prohibiting the outflow of scarce materials, push up prices; the central government's fiscal revenue is fixed, causing the proportion of national fiscal revenue to national income to drop to 22% in recent years, and the proportion of central fiscal revenue to national fiscal revenue to drop to 47.2%. At the same time, extra-budgetary funds have grown rapidly, from a few hundred billion yuan in 1979 to more than 2,000 billion yuan in 1988. Therefore, the direction of future fiscal system reform should be to appropriately increase the degree of centralization of central fiscal revenue and strengthen macro-control capabilities. In regions with conditions, preparations should be made to implement a tax-sharing system pilot. Currently, to stabilize policies and overcome the fiscal difficulties of the state, the pace of reform must be steady. For example, before the fiscal contracting system is changed, the proportion of local fiscal revenue handed over to the central government should be appropriately increased according to different situations, and some special subsidies from the central government to local areas should be reduced.

In terms of taxation, the investment tax rate should be increased to curb the blind growth of investment. The scope of tax exemptions and reductions should be rectified and narrowed, and the past abnormal situation of state-owned enterprises bearing higher taxes than collective enterprises, and collective enterprises bearing higher taxes than individual enterprises, should be changed. The income tax rate for state-owned enterprises should be appropriately reduced to avoid widespread tax evasion. After reducing the income tax rate for state-owned enterprises, the adjustment tax should be abolished, and the transition from pre-tax repayment to post-tax repayment should be gradually realized. Strict tax collection and management should be enforced, and heavy penalties should be imposed on tax evaders. The number of tax officials should be increased, and their quality should be improved, and the tax department should be managed vertically by the State Taxation Administration.

To rectify the economic environment and ease the social supply-demand contradiction, while compressing the total social demand, it is necessary to ensure and increase effective supply. For this purpose, it is necessary to adjust and improve the industrial structure, resolutely compress long-term products, and strive to increase short-term and marketable products. However, the current price structure does not match this requirement, with the prices of short-term products generally being too low, while the prices of long-term products being relatively high. Under the condition that the market-oriented role is becoming increasingly prominent, this irrational price structure is extremely unfavorable for the rational adjustment of the production structure. Therefore, during the rectification period, especially when the rectification has achieved initial results, the economy and market tend to be stable, and the public's expectation of inflation decreases, it is still necessary to seize the opportunity to steadily and gradually solve the prominent irrational problems in the price structure. This year, it is necessary and correct to appropriately raise the purchase prices of grains and cotton, and the ex-factory prices of coal, especially the significant increase in the prices of railway, civil aviation, and waterway passenger transport in September, which has not caused social shocks or chain reactions in other prices, fully proving that the timing of this price adjustment is relatively good. At the same time, it proves that during the period of controlling inflation, some price adjustments and reforms are still necessary and feasible, although major price reform steps can only be implemented after inflation is basically controlled and the overall economic environment is relatively relaxed.

In addition, reforms in enterprise systems, planning systems, material systems, foreign trade systems, and other aspects, especially enterprise reforms centered on improving micro-operating benefits, should also be continued in coordination with rectification.

Rectifying the economic order is an important aspect of rectification. Currently, the main task of rectifying the economic order is to rectify the circulation order and overcome the chaotic situation in the circulation field. This itself is an important content of the circulation system reform. In recent years, the Party and the government's decisions on strictly rectifying various types of companies, especially those in the circulation field, are very necessary and correct, and should be continued and resolutely implemented without being half-hearted. The focus of rectifying the order in the circulation field is to rectify enterprises and companies engaged in wholesale business. In addition to resolutely canceling the administrative power (such as material allocation power) of circulation enterprises and companies and the special policies they enjoy, turning all companies that are not clearly distinguished between officials and merchants into self-operating, self-profiting, and government-enterprise separated enterprises, and having senior officials' relatives withdraw from the circulation field, it is also necessary to rectify private and small collective wholesale enterprises that have developed in recent years. It seems that in the circulation field, individual or private enterprises and small collective enterprises should be developed, but their scope of activities should mainly be limited to the retail sector. For the most important production materials and consumer goods, it is not advisable for private or small collective enterprises to engage in wholesale business at this stage, otherwise it will be unfavorable for the state to regulate and control the market and increase the chaos in the circulation sector. It can be imagined that if we can achieve significant results in the rectification of the circulation field and plug the loopholes that have been lost every year in the amount of several hundred billion yuan, we will be able to get out of the economic difficulties relatively quickly.

　　用深化改革促进治理整顿
    张卓元
    党的十三届五中全会作出的关于进一步治理整顿和深化改革的决定，是在我国经济发展和改革新阶段的重大战略决策。继续坚定不移地执行治理整顿和深化改革的方针，是克服当前经济困难，实现国民经济持续、稳定、协调发展的根本途径。
    从去年9月以来，党和政府采取了一些非常措施，包括冻结一部分产品的价格，用增加财政补贴的办法极力稳住居民最基本生活必需品的价格；对原来已放开的计划外重要生产资料实行最高限价；把年物价上涨率层层分解给地方“承包”，在某种程度上助长了地方封锁；对一部分紧缺的重要生产资料和消费品如化肥、农药、粮食、棉花、四种钢材等实行专营；对一些重要农业原材料如蚕茧、烟叶等实行统一收购；在一个时期内关闭一部分产品市场；加强对资金供应的额度控制和工资的总量控制，等等。这种情况，曾使一些人对治理整顿的必要性和正确性产生怀疑。实际上，上述情况只是短时期和局部性现象。随着治理整顿的深入发展，为了真正达到治理整顿的目标，除了在一个时期特别是初期和局部范围内需要加强直接的行政控制外，更重要的，是要在许多重要方面推进改革，深化改革，用改革来促进和保证治理整顿任务的实现。
    治理经济环境，很重要的一条，是治理通货膨胀，克服物价上涨率过高现象。为此，在开头需要运用行政手段，冻结或半冻结一部分最重要商品和劳务的价格。但是，这种办法时效有限，主要是赢得喘息时间，使过热的经济降温，重新协调社会总供给和总需求的关系。但要从根本上解决经济一再发生过热的问题，保证国民经济的稳定发展，需要改革经济运行机制，首先是对宏观调控机制进行改革，建立比较合理的、能够促进经济稳定发展的宏观调控体系。从这一点出发，我认为，为了配合治理整顿，应当很好的推进金融体制的改革，要强化中央银行宏观调控职能，严格控制货币发行和信贷总规模；要改变长期以来货币政策依附于财政政策，要使中央银行能够比较独立地行使它的货币政策。这是关住滥发票子的“总闸门”的改革，既不花钱，又有利于治理通货膨胀。这项改革同抑制需求膨胀的努力相配合，能够釜底抽薪，治理通货膨胀。中央银行制订的年货币供应量增长计划要有充分的经济根据，坚决摒弃用过量供应货币来支撑经济高速增长的政策。要控制信贷总规模，实施从紧的信贷政策，同时调整和改善信贷结构，更好地运用信贷手段贯彻国家的产业政策。
    在改革宏观调控机制过程中，利率手段的运用将日益重要。在有计划商品经济体制下，利率是宏观调控的重要杠杆。利率是资金的价格，利率的变化应能灵敏反映和调节资金的供求关系，使经济扩张（降低利率）或收缩（提高利率）。为了抑制经济过热状态，要适当提高利率，这是为世界各国经验所证明了的行之有效的办法。因此，对于去年以来我国几次提高利率，以及开展保值储蓄等做法，应予肯定。这些措施对于稳定市场、稳定金融，起了很好的作用。至于提高存款利率对鼓励储蓄的作用，更是有目共睹的。存款利率提高以后，贷款利率也要相应提高，这有助于经济降温，抑制投资热，排挤效益低下的生产和经营。与此同时，国家可以运用财政贴息等办法，鼓励对短线产品生产的投资，改善产业结构。
    为了加强宏观调控，财政税收体制也要进一步改革。在治理整顿期间，需要尽快建立经常性支出和投资支出分列的复式预算制度，建立财政政策性融资体系。1988年全面实行的地方财政包干有利有弊，有利方面是可以有利于调动地方政府发展经济，增加财政收入的积极性，其弊端主要是：强化了地方利益，削弱了中央的宏观调控能力。在地方财政包干体制下，各地从本地利益出发，争相上短平快项目，投资迅速膨胀，重复建设严重，各地经济结构趋同化，资源配置效益下降，国家调整和改善经济结构的努力往往受阻，基础产业和加工工业的失衡加剧；地区封锁，市场分割，妨碍全国统一市场的形成；抬价抢购原材料，禁止短缺物资外流，推动着物价上涨；包死了中央财政，使这几年国家财政收入占国民收入的比重下降到22％，中央财政占全国财政收入的比重降到47.2％。与此同时，预算外资金增长迅速，从1979年的几百亿元猛增到1988年的两千多亿元。因此，今后财政体制改革的方向要适当提高中央财政集中的程度，加强宏观调控能力，在有条件的地区，准备实行分税制试点。当前，为了稳定政策，渡过国家财政难关，改革步子必须稳妥。比如，在财政包干体制未改变之前，应根据不同情况，适当提高地方上交中央财政收入的比例，减少中央财政对地方的一些专项补贴等。
    在税收方面，要提高投资税率，以抑制投资的盲目增长。要整顿和缩小税收减免范围，改变过去税负国营高于集体、集体高于个体的不正常状态。国营企业的所得税率应适当降低，以免造成普遍的偷税漏税。国营企业所得税率降低以后，取消调节税，并逐步实现把税前还贷改为税后还贷。严格税收征管，对偷税漏税逃税者处以重罚。增加税务人员，提高素质，把税务部门改由国家税务局垂直管理。
    治理经济环境，缓解社会供需矛盾，在压缩社会总需求的同时，要保证和增加有效供给。为此，就要调整和改善产业结构，坚决压缩长线产品，努力增加短线和适销对路产品。但是，当前价格结构同这个要求很不适应，短线产品价格一般偏低，而长线产品价格则相对偏高。在市场导向作用日益明显的条件下，这种不合理的价格结构极不利于生产结构的合理调整。因此，在治理整顿期间，特别是在治理整顿取得初步成效，经济和市场趋于稳定，群众对通货膨胀的预期降低的条件下，对于价格结构突出不合理问题，仍应抓住时机，稳妥地逐步解决。今年适当提高粮、棉收购价格，提高煤炭出厂价格，特别是9月份较大幅度提高铁路、民航、水路客运价，是必要的、正确的，而且也没有引起社会震荡和其它价格的连锁反应，充分说明，这次调价时机掌握得较好。同时证明，在治理通货膨胀期间，有些价格调整和改革还是必要的和可行的，虽然大的价格改革步骤要在通货膨胀得到基本治理、整个经济环境比较宽松以后才能实行。
    此外，企业体制、计划体制、物资体制、外贸体制等等方面的改革，特别是以提高微观运营效益为中心的企业改革，也要配合治理整顿，继续进行。
    整顿经济秩序，是治理整顿的一个重要方面。整顿经济秩序，当前主要是整顿流通秩序，克服流通领域的混乱状态。这本身就是流通体制改革的重要内容。近年来党和政府关于严格整顿各类公司特别是流通领域的公司的决策是非常必要的正确的，应当继续坚决实施，不能半途而废。整顿流通领域秩序的重点，是整顿从事批发业务的企业和公司。除了坚决取消流通企业和公司的行政权力（如物资分配权）与享受的特殊政策，把一切官商不分的公司办成自主经营、自负盈亏、政企分开的企业，高级干部的近亲一律从流通领域退出以外，还要对近几年发展起来的私人和小集体办的批发企业进行整顿。看来，在流通领域，个体或私人企业以及小集体企业是要发展的，但其活动范围应主要限制在零售环节，对于最重要的生产资料和消费品，现阶段似不宜让私人或小集体插手批发业务，否则不利于国家调节和控制市场，增加流通环节的混乱。可以设想，如果我们能够在流通领域的整顿中取得显著成效，把过去每年流失几百亿元的漏洞堵住，我们就能够比较快的走出经济困境。
