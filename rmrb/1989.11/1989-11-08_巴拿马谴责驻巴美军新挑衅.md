Panama on November 6 condemned the recent military provocations by the United States in Panama and called on the United Nations Secretary-General to urge the United States not to deliberately escalate tensions.

Panama's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Oscar Severely, wrote in a letter to the Secretary-General that on October 30, approximately 200 U.S. troops stationed in the Panama Canal Zone, with the support of tanks and aircraft, occupied a small town near the capital, Panama City, intimidating civilians and surrounding a police camp. The next day, another group of the same number of U.S. troops invaded another small town 18 kilometers from the capital and launched a simulated attack on the Panamanian Defense Forces.

    巴拿马谴责驻巴美军新挑衅
    巴拿马六日在联合国谴责美国最近对巴拿马进行的军事挑衅，并呼吁联合国秘书长劝说美国不要蓄意使紧张局势升级。
    巴拿马常驻联合国代表奥斯卡·塞韦列六日在给秘书长的一封信中说，十月三十日大约二百名驻在巴拿马运河区的美军在坦克和飞机的掩护下，占领了离首都巴拿马城不远的一座小镇，恫吓平民百姓，包围警察营地。第二天，数目相同的另一部分美军侵入离首都十八公里的另一座小镇，向巴拿马国防军发动模拟进攻。
