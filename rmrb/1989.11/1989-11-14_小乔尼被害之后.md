October 27th was an ordinary day, but an incident that occurred on the streets of Stockholm that day shook the entire city and the nation, prompting deep reflection among Swedes. On that day, a 16-year-old student named Johnny, like any other day, was walking towards the entrance of a subway station on Jöt Street. At that moment, a 25-year-old young man approached him without provocation, stabbing him in the throat with a broken glass bottle. Johnny, injured and bleeding profusely, stopped breathing on the way to the hospital.

The news spread, and kind-hearted people could not help but feel sad for the innocent child who was wrongfully killed. In the following days, Johnny's classmates, friends, and many parents of children came to the spot on Jöt Street where he was killed, laying bouquets of flowers and lighting candles. This was not only a tribute to the deceased but also a protest against the increasing street violence.

Right at the spot where Johnny was killed, a young woman named Irma initiated a "Stop Violence" signature campaign. She herself was a victim of "street violence," as her mother was kicked to death by four young men last year. Now, she and her husband stand on the street, calling on people to join the campaign to stop violence. Her actions have received support from the media and the public, with tens of thousands of people signing up in just a few days.

According to reports, violent incidents on the streets of Swedish cities have been increasing in recent years. Just the recorded cases alone, there were 10,320 in 1987, 12,128 in 1988, and a 7% increase in the first 10 months of this year compared to the same period last year. Among these, cases of women being beaten and assaulted on the streets of Stockholm increased by 22%. Just five days before Johnny was killed, a 17-year-old girl in the southern Swedish city of Karlshamn suddenly went missing. Later, it was found that the girl had been killed, and her body was thrown into a river.

Many people believe that society and parents do not pay enough attention to the education and care of children, leading some young people to have empty minds and nothing to do, thus causing trouble on the streets and creating incidents. This is one of the reasons for the increase in street violence. The widespread distribution of violent videotapes and the increasing prevalence of alcoholism and drug abuse among young people are more direct causes of the increase in violent activities.

In recent days, Swedish radio, television, and newspapers have extensively reported on the "street violence" issue. Swedish Prime Minister Carlsson made a statement on Johnny's murder. He said that soon he would convene a meeting with government officials, social workers, police, youth organizations, and parents' representatives to discuss how to stop social violence.

    小乔尼被害之后
    新华社记者　陈文英　许福瑞
    10月27日是一个普通的日子，然而这天发生在斯德哥尔摩街头的一桩儿童被害事件却震动了全城乃至整个国家，也引起了瑞典人的深思。这一天，不满16岁的中学生乔尼像往常一样，在约特大街上向一个地铁车站入口处走去。此时，迎面过来一个25岁的年轻人无端向他寻衅，用破碎的玻璃瓶向他的喉咙扎去。小乔尼受伤后鲜血直流，在被送往医院途中停止了呼吸。
    消息传开，善良的人们无不为这个天真无邪的孩子无辜被害感到悲哀。连日来，乔尼的同学、朋友以及许多孩子的家长纷纷来到约特街他遇害的地方献上一束束鲜花，点燃一支支蜡烛。这既是对死者的悼念，也是对日益增多的街头暴力行为的抗议。
    就在乔尼被害的地方，一位名叫伊尔玛的年轻妇女发起了“制止暴力”的签名活动。她本人也是“街头暴力”的受害者，去年她的母亲被四个男青年无端踢死。现在她和她的丈夫站在街头呼吁人们加入制止暴力的行列。她的行动得到了舆论界和群众的支持，几天来已有上万人签了名。
    据报道，发生在瑞典城市街头的暴力事件最近几年不断增加。仅记录在案的，1987年为10320起，1988年增加到12128起，今年1—10月比去年同期又增长7％，其中斯德哥尔摩妇女在街头遭殴打、凌辱的案件增长22％。就在乔尼遇害前5天，瑞典南部城市卡尔斯哈姆一位17岁的姑娘突然失踪，后来人们发现姑娘被害，尸体被扔入河中。
    许多人认为，社会与家长对孩子教育与关心不够，致使一些青年人思想空虚，无所事事，于是上街滋事，制造事端。这是街头暴力事件增加的一个原因。广泛传播的暴力录像带以及青年中日益盛行的酗酒、吸毒，则是暴力活动增多更直接的原因。
    连日来，瑞典电台、电视台、报纸等新闻媒介对“街头暴力”问题作了大量报道。瑞典首相卡尔松就乔尼被害发表了谈话。他表示，不久他将召集由政府官员、社会工作者、警察、青年组织以及家长代表参加的会议，专门讨论如何制止社会暴力的问题。
