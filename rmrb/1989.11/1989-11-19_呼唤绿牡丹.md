    Calling for the Green Peony
    By Hu Shaoliang, Secretary of the Jiangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhejiang Province

    When hot water is poured over it, the leaves and buds unfurl into blooms, their vibrant green color bright and clear, like green peonies in full bloom in the cup. The fragrance is refreshing, invigorating the mind and spirit. This is the Jiangshan Green Peony tea, listed in the "Compendium of Chinese Specialty Products." In 1982, tea experts from various regions, invited by the Ministry of Commerce, gathered in Changsha, Hunan, to evaluate the top 30 teas in the country. The Jiangshan Green Peony tea was ranked second.

    Is it because the name is too famous? To drink a cup of Zhejiang Jiangshan Green Peony tea is truly "as difficult as ascending to the heavens." A Japanese businessman came to purchase it by reputation but returned empty-handed. A Taiwanese "tea enthusiast" searched through all the markets and warehouses in Jiangshan City but did not see a single leaf of "Green Peony." Materials provided by the Jiangshan Tea Company indicate that over the past 10 years, the total production of Jiangshan "Green Peony" was 1,246 kilograms, averaging only about 100 kilograms per year. Apart from a portion used as samples for export, the rest is also merely "samples." It is no wonder that many people in Jiangshan have "heard of it but never seen it."

    This is an incredible fact: the main production area of "Green Peony," Ba'an Township's Pei Jia Di Village, has tea gardens overgrown with weeds, almost unmanaged; the "Green Peony" tea garden base has remained at a few hundred acres for a decade, with no expansion; the picking and processing of "Green Peony" have many unique aspects, but there are fewer than 10 people who truly master this technology... This situation does not match the fame of "Green Peony"; the main reason for this situation is precisely to maintain its "fame."

    This summer, the Jiangshan Municipal Government, amidst the widespread calls for "Green Peony," convened representatives from supply and marketing, agriculture, and other sectors to formulate a series of measures to promote large-scale production. It was clearly stipulated that the "Green Peony" would be managed by the Tea Company. A blueprint was drawn: by 1994, develop 2,000 acres of famous tea gardens, producing 4,000 kilograms of "Green Peony" annually. However, due to insufficient funds and other reasons, achieving this blueprint is fraught with difficulties. The manager of the Jiangshan Tea Company, Zhou Jun, expressed to the media that he welcomes domestic and foreign visionaries to come to Jiangshan to cooperate in developing this "ancient imperial tea, modern national tea."

    呼唤绿牡丹
    中共浙江省江山市委　胡韶良
    开水冲泡下去，叶芽展开成朵，色泽翠绿明亮，恰似朵朵绿牡丹在杯中盛开，清香飘逸，沁人心脾。这就是载入《中国土特产大全》的江山绿牡丹茶。1982年，商业部邀来的各地评茶行家荟萃一堂，在湖南长沙评出全国30种名茶。排在第二位的就是这种茶。
    是其名太盛吗？要喝上一杯浙江江山绿牡丹，真是“难如上青天”。一位日本客商慕名赶来采购，结果空手而回。一位台湾“茶迷”踏遍江山市区的商场货栈，终未看到一叶“绿牡丹”。江山市茶叶公司提供的材料表明，最近10年间，江山“绿牡丹”的总产量为1246公斤，平均每年只有100多公斤，除拿一部分作“样品”似地出口外，余下来的差不多也仅仅是
  “样品”了，难怪许多江山人也是
  “只闻其名，未见其物”。
    这是难以置信的事实：“绿牡丹”主要产地保安乡裴家地村的茶园杂草丛生，近乎失管；“绿牡丹”茶园基地十年保持几百亩，难以扩大；“绿牡丹”的采制有许多独特之处，但真正掌握这门技术的“制茶师傅”不上10人……这种现状与“绿牡丹”所享有的名气不相匹配；造成这种现状的首要原因，恰恰是为了保住“名气”。
    今年夏季，江山市政府在千呼万唤“绿牡丹”的声浪中，召集供销、农业等“六国四方”代表制订促进规模生产的系列措施。明确规定“绿牡丹”由茶叶公司统一经营，并描绘了这样一幅蓝图：到1994年，发展名茶园2000亩，年产“绿牡丹”4000公斤。然而，由于资金不足等原因，要实现这一蓝图困难很多。江山茶叶公司经理周君望向新闻界表示，欢迎国内外有识之士来江山，合作开发这一“古时的御茶、当今的国茗”。
