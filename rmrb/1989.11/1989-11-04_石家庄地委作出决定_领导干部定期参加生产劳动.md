People's Daily, Shijiazhuang, November 4th.

The Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of Hebei Province recently decided that all levels of leading cadres should take the lead in participating in production labor to carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and struggle, and to strengthen ties with the masses.

The decision explicitly stipulates that leading cadres at all levels should establish the practice of participating in production labor. In terms of time, it is required that leading cadres at the municipal level and directly under the municipality should participate in labor for no less than 1 day per month; county-level and county-directly under units should participate for no less than 2 days; township-level units should participate for no less than 3 days; and enterprise and institution units should participate for no less than 4 days. The labor venues can be in the sectors they oversee, participating in labor at any time and place as work allows, or they can designate a relatively fixed labor point. When laboring in rural areas, they must eat at the homes of farmers; when laboring in industrial and mining enterprises, they must eat in the workers' canteens, and special treatment is not allowed.

The Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee also emphasized that leading cadres participating in production labor should propagate the Party's line, principles, and policies to the masses, conduct investigations and research among the masses, and solve practical problems in the masses' production and life. To timely grasp the labor situation of leading cadres, the region has uniformly printed registration cards, one per person, to be filled out truthfully by the individuals themselves and signed by the person in charge of the unit where they participate in labor. The organization and personnel departments will uniformly manage and periodically check, and publicly post the results.

    石家庄地委作出决定
    领导干部定期参加生产劳动
    本报石家庄电　记者陈国琦报道：河北省石家庄地委最近作出决定，要求全区各级领导干部带头参加生产劳动，以发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，密切同群众的联系。
    决定明文规定，各级领导干部要把参加生产劳动作为一项制度坚持下去。在时间上要求地级及地直单位领导干部，每月劳动时间不少于1天；县级及县直单位不少于2天；乡级不少于3天；企事业单位不少于4天。劳动场所，可以在分管的战线，结合工作随时随地参加，也可以确定一个相对固定的劳动点。到农村劳动，一律到农户吃派饭；在工矿企业劳动，一律到职工食堂就餐，不许搞特殊化。
    石家庄地委还强调，领导干部参加生产劳动，要向群众宣传党的路线、方针、政策，向群众作调查研究，解决群众生产和生活中存在的实际问题。为了及时掌握领导干部劳动情况，地区统一印制了登记卡，人手一册，由本人如实填写，并交参加劳动单位的负责人签名。由组织、人事部门统一掌握，定期检查，张榜公布。
