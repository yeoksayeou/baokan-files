The United States and the Soviet Union will begin a new round of negotiations in New York today on the issue of reducing chemical weapons.

The U.S. State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said the purpose of this round of talks is to formulate implementation steps for the memorandum of understanding signed last month by the foreign ministers of the two countries on reducing chemical weapons. The memorandum requires the two countries to exchange data on their chemical weapons reserves and to propose methods for verifying this data.

Boucher said the two sides will also preliminarily discuss the proposal made by U.S. President George H.W. Bush last month at the United Nations General Assembly regarding the significant reduction of chemical weapons stockpiles by the United States and the Soviet Union. Bush stated that the United States is willing to immediately reduce its chemical weapons stockpiles by 80% if the Soviet Union also reduces its stockpiles to the same level. However, the Soviet Union believes that the two countries should not only reduce but also stop the production of chemical weapons.

According to reports, the Soviet Union currently possesses 50,000 tons of poison gas, while the United States has approximately 30,000 tons of nerve gas and is preparing to produce a new type of "binary" poison gas.

    美苏重开削减化学武器谈判
    新华社华盛顿10月30日电  美国和苏联的谈判代表今天将在纽约就削减化学武器问题开始新的一轮谈判。
    美国国务院发言人塔特怀勒说，这一轮谈判的目的是为美苏两国外长上个月就削减化学武器签定的备忘录制订实施步骤。备忘录要求两国交换有关化学武器储备的数据并提出核查这些数据的方法。
    塔特怀勒说，双方还将初步讨论美国总统布什上个月在联合国大会上提出的关于美苏大幅度削减化学武器库存量的建议。布什表示美国愿意立即将化学武器库存量削减80％，如果苏联也将其库存削减到同一水平的话。但苏联认为，美苏两国不仅应削减而且应停止生产化学武器。
    据报道，目前苏联拥有5万吨毒气，美国约有3万吨神经毒气并准备生产一种新的“二元”毒气。
