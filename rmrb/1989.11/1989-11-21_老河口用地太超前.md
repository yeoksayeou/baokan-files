Recently, I visited Old River Mouth City (formerly Guanghua County, Hubei Province) and was deeply concerned about the city's urban planning and land use, which I found to be overly advanced.

Old River Mouth City is a county-level city with a population of only one hundred thousand. The streets have numerous names, the main roads are wide, but there are few vehicles; the sidewalks are excessively wide. There are very few pedestrians. The width of the streets in Old River Mouth can rival that of Wuhan's Zhongshan Road. The city's government buildings are numerous, mostly standalone four to five-story structures. Some government agencies occupy land areas that are even more impressive than those of some provincial-level agencies. On a so-called commercial street, there are twenty-seven small and large shops. The Old River Mouth Department Store has six floors and a building area of over ten thousand square meters; in twenty minutes, I counted only thirty-four customers. The same is true for the Ebei Commercial Store. How can urban construction be so excessive and extravagant?

　　老河口用地太超前
    湖北省黄石市　林徐
    最近，我去了一趟老河口市（原湖北省光化县），对老河口市城镇规划用地过于超前深感忧虑。
    老河口市是一个县级市，城镇人口仅有十万，街道名称繁多，主干道宽阔，而车辆无几；人行道严重超宽。行人寥寥可数。该市街道宽度已可与武汉中山大道一争高下。那里的市直机关大楼林立，大多是独门独户的四五层建筑。有的机关圈地面积比一些省直机关还要壮观。在一条所谓的商业街，有大小二十七座商场（店）。老河口商场有六层楼，建筑面积在一万平方米以上；我在二十分钟内数了一下，总共只有三十四名顾客。鄂北商场也是如此。市镇建设怎么能这么贪大贪多呢？
