74 countries, including China, pledged nearly $1 billion to the United Nations' development activities for 1990 during a two-day pledging conference held from Monday to Tuesday.

Chinese Ambassador Ding Yuanhong announced at the meeting that China had pledged $6.16 million and 1.27 million yuan for the activities of various United Nations agencies in the coming year.

United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said at the pledging conference that this meeting provided an opportunity for countries to demonstrate through concrete actions their desire to use the United Nations to address the challenges facing the international community. He said that in the face of many new and urgent global issues, the United Nations needed a stable expansion of its financial resources to make the most satisfactory contributions to economic and social development.

The approximately $1 billion pledged by China and the other 73 countries will be mainly used for the activities of the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Population Fund, and the United Nations Environment Programme.
