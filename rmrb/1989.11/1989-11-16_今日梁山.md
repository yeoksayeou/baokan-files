Liangshan, located in Liangshan County, Shandong Province, is named after the tomb of Prince Liang of the Han Dynasty, but it gained fame through the novel "Water Margin." During the late Northern Song Dynasty, it served as a base for peasant rebel armies, making it a renowned mountain of the common people.

At the foot of Liangshan, there is a stone platform. To the south, it is flanked by steep cliffs, standing like a screen. Inscribed on the cliffs are words from contemporary calligraphers and painters. The four characters "Water Margin Liangshan" written by Shu Tong are particularly striking, exuding a sense of grandeur and majesty. Fan Zeng's inscription reads, "Breaking through the heavenly net to return to the Water Margin, lifting the earthly net to ascend Liangshan," capturing the essence of Liangshan.

From the western side of the platform, a stone staircase leads up the mountain, consisting of 108 steps, symbolizing the 108 heroes of Liangshan. At the end of the staircase stands the "Duanjin Pavilion," also known as the "Tongxin Pavilion," named after the phrase from the "Yijing" that "two people with one heart can cut gold." The pavilion is rectangular, with stone tables and benches inside. It is said that Lin Chong's rebellion against Wang Lun took place here.

Not far from the pavilion is the Black Wind Pavilion. Beside it stands a statue of Li Kui, holding two battle-axes, with a towering and imposing figure. The cliff is known as Black Wind Pass, situated between Tiger Head Peak and Snow Mountain Peak. It was the strategic point for the rebel army to cross from water to land. The terrain is treacherous, and the mountain winds are fierce. To the west of the pavilion, there is a mountain path about half a mile long. At the end of the path, hidden among the trees, is a platform known as the "Shufai Platform," likely a place for distributing wealth to the poor. Standing on the cliff, one can see Phoenix Mountain, Green Dragon Mountain, and Turtle Mountain to the north, with television towers rising high into the clouds. The tomb of King Liang is located within the mountain. To the east, there is a stone archway with the inscription "Jingwu," which is barely legible. Inside the archway is a large, flat area, which was the site of the former "Pointing Generals Platform" and martial arts arena. On the cliff wall, there are ruins of the Tang Dynasty Lotus Temple, with a stone Buddha still standing on a lotus pedestal, exquisitely carved and considered a masterpiece. Below the cliff are fields and orchards, lush and green, known as the "Peach Blossom Village" from "Water Margin." When the peach and plum blossoms bloom, they are as beautiful as a brocade. Beyond the peach and plum trees, there are extensive plantings of hawthorn and pear trees. When the pear blossoms are in full bloom, they resemble a sea of snow, becoming one of Liangshan's famous scenic spots, known as the "Snow Lotus Platform."

Beyond Black Wind Pass, one can see the "Song Jiang Horse Path." The stone path is smooth, serving as the necessary route for the leaders of Liangshan to reach the rear camp. The rear camp is located on Phoenix Mountain, now known as Houji Village. At the end of the horse path, there are remnants of a large stone wall, which was part of the main camp. Inside the camp, there is a large well. These are all relics from the time of the rebellion. To the east of the well is the wall of the Loyalty and Righteousness Hall.

The Loyalty and Righteousness Hall is the main building of Liangshan. The gate faces south, with the inscription "Water Margin Camp" and couplets reading, "Hidden tigers and leopards within the city of Yuanzhou, gathered dragons and serpents in the marshes of Lv'er," written by Liu Kaitai. Entering the gate, one immediately sees the Loyalty and Righteousness Hall, with an inscription by Liu Haishu. The couplets read, "Always cherishing loyalty and righteousness, not loving wealth and not disturbing the people," which are original lines from "Water Margin," written by Qi Gong. In front of the hall, there is a yellow flag with the words "Acting on behalf of heaven," and red flags on either side with the inscriptions "Shandong Protector of the People" and "King of the Northern River." In the courtyard, there is a large stone with a hole in the middle, which was the base for the flagpole from the time of the rebellion. The east and west wings display calligraphy and paintings by contemporary masters, many of which depict the heroes of Liangshan. Below the south wall of the camp, there are stone pillars on either side, used for executing military law. The Loyalty and Righteousness Hall served as the main hall for the leaders of Liangshan to discuss matters, with high and imposing buildings.

Liangshan stands at an elevation of 197 meters, with the Loyalty and Righteousness Hall built on the highest peak, Tiger Head Peak, reconstructed on the original site. Although Liangshan is not a high mountain, 700 years ago it was surrounded by water, known as the 800-li water marsh, making it a strategic stronghold that was easy to defend and difficult to attack. Today, standing on the mountain, one sees fields and villages stretching out, giving a sense of the changing times and the passage of history. The 800-li water marsh of Liangshan has become a thing of the past, evoking a feeling of the world changing and a new era dawning.

    今日梁山
    张寒朗
    梁山，位于山东省梁山县，因汉文帝子梁孝王墓而得名，它的出名却是由于《水浒传》。北宋末年，这里曾为农民起义军的根据地，是一座草莽名山。
    梁山脚下，有一处石坪，南面为削崖峭壁，峙列如屏，上镌当代书画名家题词。舒同所书“水泊梁山”四字，庄重雄健，气势磅礴，最为醒目。范曾所书则是“撞破天网归水浒，掀开地网上梁山”，道出梁山的特点。
    由坪西循石阶登山，共有108阶级，应梁山一百单八将之数。石阶尽处有“断金亭”，又名同心亭，取《易经·系辞》“二人同心，其利断金”之义。亭形长方，内设石案石凳。据说当年林冲火并王伦即在此处。
    距亭不远有黑风亭，亭畔有李逵雕像，手执两把板斧，身躯伟岸，威风凛凛。崖头名黑风口，介乎虎头峰与雪山峰之间，是起义军舍水登山的咽喉。地势险隘，山风猛烈。亭西有山径，长约半里，尽处绿树掩映可见一台，是为“疏财台”，大约是周济贫困之处。站立崖上，北望可见凤凰山、青龙山和龟山，山上有电视塔，高插入云。梁王墓即在山中。东望近山有石坊，额题“经武”，依稀可辨；坊内为大片平坦地带，有当年点将台、比武场旧迹。崖壁有唐莲台寺遗址，尚存石佛一尊立于莲台之上，雕刻精美，堪称一绝。崖下为田畴，果木繁茂，一派青绿，是《水浒传》中的杏花村。桃杏花开，锦绣如云，美丽非常。桃杏之外，广植棠梨，梨花盛时，雪涌千堆，成为梁山一大景观，名为“雪花莲台”。
    黑风口一过，便见“宋江马道”。石径平滑，是梁山头领到后寨的必经之路。后寨在凤凰山，今名后集村。马道尽处有巨石砌成的残壁断垣，是为大营寨墙。寨内有大水井。这些均为当年聚义旧物。井东便到忠义堂的寨墙了。
    忠义堂是梁山的主要建筑，寨门南向，匾题“水浒寨”，门联为“宛子城中藏虎豹，蓼儿洼内聚蛟龙”，出自刘开渠手笔。进得大门，迎面便是忠义堂，刘海粟题额。楹联为“常怀贞烈常忠义，不爱资财不扰民”，系《水浒传》原句，启功书写。堂前中立杏黄旗，书“替天行道”，东西为红旗，分书“山东呼保义”“河北王麒麟”。院中有铺地巨石，中有孔穴，亦系当年竖旗石基旧物。东西厢房，陈列当代名家书画，其中图写梁山英雄，颇多佳制。寨内南墙下，东西分立石柱，系供执行军法之用。忠义堂为梁山首领议事大厅，屋宇高大，气象森严。
    梁山海拔197米，忠义堂建于最高的虎头峰上，系依旧基重建。梁山虽非高山，但700多年前四周皆水，号称800里水泊，易守难攻，遂成险要。如今，站立山头，所见则是阡陌纵横，村落暖暖。梁山的800里水泊已成历史陈迹，使人顿生沧海桑田、换了人间之感。
