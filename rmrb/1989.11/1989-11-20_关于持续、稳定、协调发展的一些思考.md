The decade of reform and opening up has achieved widely recognized great success, but due to some mistakes in recent years, issues such as economic overheating and inflation have emerged. We must go through a severe period of difficulties, improve rectification and deepen reform, to make the national economy move onto the path of sustainable, stable, and coordinated development. To this end, we should calmly reflect on: Why does our national economy experience such significant fluctuations repeatedly? How can we avoid such dramatic ups and downs and achieve sustainable, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy?

The root cause of the dramatic ups and downs lies in the rapid rise, and the source of the rapid rise is the detachment from reality and the eagerness for quick success. The 12th National Congress of the Party in 1982 formulated the development strategy for socialist construction in this century, which required "under the premise of continuously improving economic efficiency, striving to double the total annual output value of industry and agriculture in the country"; the strategic focus was to strengthen "agriculture, energy, transportation, education, and science, these fundamental links"; the strategic deployment was to proceed in two steps: "in the first ten years, mainly lay a solid foundation, accumulate strength, create conditions, and in the next ten years, enter a new period of economic revitalization," that is, "slow first, fast later." The designed growth rate was an average annual increase of 7.2%. This was in line with the pragmatic line of thought of the 11th Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, and it was a path of sustainable, stable, and coordinated development. However, in the later years, especially in recent years, some mistakes in the actual implementation have caused deviations. The growth rate of output value far exceeded the originally planned speed. Although the achievements were significant, two major costs were paid: first, grain and cotton production stagnated for five years, and other strategic focuses were not strengthened, while the processing industry developed too rapidly, causing a disproportionate relationship; second, economic relations were not straightened out, especially in the circulation sector, many chaotic phenomena emerged. As a common result of these two issues, obvious inflation and a decline in overall efficiency occurred.

This major fluctuation compared to the past "Great Leap Forward" and the "Cultural Revolution," and the two years of impetuous advancement that caused dramatic ups and downs, there are differences in nature or degree. However, it should also be noted that it has many new characteristics. Firstly, in the past, it was caused by a short-term behavior of the government, while this time it was caused by the short-term behaviors of both the government and enterprises. These two short-term behaviors reinforced each other. Secondly, in the past, it was mainly the expansion of accumulation, while this time it was the expansion of both accumulation and consumption. This is the inevitable result of the two short-term behaviors. Because both seek to expand investment, while the short-term behavior of enterprises is more inclined to expand consumption. Thirdly, in the past, heavy industry developed too fast, while light industry lagged behind, this time, some high-end durable consumer goods in light industry developed at an extremely high speed, while basic industries in heavy industry lagged behind. Fourthly, in the past, there was little or no foreign borrowing, while this time there was more foreign borrowing. Borrowing foreign capital, if the amount is appropriate and used properly, can promote technological improvement and accelerate economic development; if used improperly, even for importing high-end consumer goods and luxury items, it will cause waste and loss, increasing the difficulty of repayment. Fifthly, in the past, the problems of disproportion and material shortages caused by too fast economic development were exposed relatively quickly, and adjustments were made relatively promptly; this time, foreign borrowing provided a buffer, and the problems were exposed relatively slowly. In fact, from the fourth quarter of 1984, inflation began to appear, and contradictions were initially exposed. At that time, an adjustment called "soft landing" was started, but it had not yet "landed" when it "took off" again at an even higher level, until the decision was made at the 3rd Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Party in September 1988 to implement the policy of rectification and deepening reform, the economic adjustment was restarted. This is closely related to the fact that foreign borrowing at that time to some extent covered up the sharpness of the contradiction between the national income expenditure and the national income production. During the peak period of borrowing, the economy was prosperous, and there was a "good feeling about oneself"; when it reached the peak period of repayment, the national income expenditure was significantly less than the national income production, and the contradictions accumulated in the past were concentratedly exposed. Finally, it should be emphasized that during the past few major ups and downs, economic strength was relatively weak, while this time economic strength has significantly increased, and people's lives have significantly improved. This is the great achievement of China's socialist construction and reform in the past 10 years, which provides a much stronger material foundation for us to carry out economic adjustment, improve rectification and deepening reform. Of course, in the current situation where power is decentralized and the subjects of interest are diversified, how to concentrate financial and material resources and use them for adjustment in a planned manner still urgently needs the unified understanding and joint efforts of the whole country.

How can we avoid the national economy from experiencing such major fluctuations in the future? Fundamentally, we must adhere to the Party's basic line, adhere to seeking truth from facts, and respect objective laws. This involves a very broad range of issues. In this short article, I will only discuss how to change the short-term behaviors of the government and enterprises and strive to act according to objective laws. I believe that to overcome these short-term behaviors, efforts are needed in both correcting the ideological line and establishing a reasonable economic mechanism. Years of practice have proven that these two aspects are complementary, and any approach that emphasizes one aspect while neglecting the other is unacceptable. Specifically, there are the following points:

	—	Seriously carry out re-education on the pragmatic line of thought for cadres at all levels, especially leading cadres. In economic development, impatience and eagerness for quick success reflect a subjective idealist trend that is detached from China's national conditions and strength. We should closely combine the experiences and lessons of China's national economy experiencing several major ups and downs, oppose the idealism and metaphysics that are detached from China's reality and pursue high speed one-sidedly, firmly establish the materialist thought of investigation and research and starting from reality, and adhere to the dialectical thought of "only by not doing something can we do something," "haste makes waste," and "too much is as bad as too little" in construction. We should fully recognize the long-term, arduous, and gradual nature of China's socialist construction. Leading cadres should abandon the narrow-minded idea of "leaving significant achievements during my term" and strive to cultivate the great vision of "leaving momentum and impetus during my term."

	—	Implement the democratization, scientification, and legalization of economic decision-making. Major decisions must be made through collective wisdom, repeated deliberation, and listening to different opinions. We should carry out comprehensive research on the positive and negative effects of policies and strategies for negative effects. Once the national economic plan and fiscal budget are approved by the power organ, they must be strictly implemented and cannot be arbitrarily modified and changed. The evaluation of cadres should be based on policies and plans as the standard, and not one-sidedly based on "the faster the speed, the better" and "the more the residents' income increases, the better." For unreasonable fast and more, it should not be encouraged but criticized. The guidance of public opinion should also pay great attention to this issue.

	—	Strengthen and improve macroeconomic management. To maintain the balance between supply and demand in terms of quantity and structure, we must first grasp the balance of finance, credit, foreign exchange, and materials, and firmly control the two aspects of finance and credit to prevent the excessive allocation of national income. Under the premise of adhering to the socialist planned economy, we should combine planning adjustment with market adjustment. Direct adjustment and indirect adjustment should be interconnected and not leave gaps, causing the economy to run disorderly. The state should concentrate the necessary financial and material resources as the "capital" for macro-control. The economic management system and fiscal management system should not only be conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of all parties but also be conducive to the optimization of national resource allocation. This is an important part of reform.

	—	Gradually reform and improve the microeconomic mechanism. Through deepening reform, we should make enterprises have both incentive mechanisms and restraint mechanisms, change the mechanism of profit without loss and induce short-term behaviors, and truly become relatively independent, self-reliant, and autonomous economic entities. We should establish a market with normal order under the guidance of the state plan, allowing enterprises to compete on an equal footing, and the survival of the fittest. At the same time, we should establish an unemployment insurance system suitable for China's national conditions and improve the vocational training system to ensure social stability and the improvement of laborers' quality.

	—	Under the premise of adhering to opening up to the outside world, we should pay attention to the reasonable and effective use of foreign capital. Foreign borrowing should have a unified plan and strict management. The borrowed funds should mainly be used for key construction. In operation, not only should profits higher than interest be created, but also there should be a certain amount of export earnings to ensure timely repayment. We should also avoid the concentration of borrowing and repayment periods causing major fluctuations in the economy.

	—	Educate the broad cadres and the masses to long-term maintain and carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and frugal construction. The rationalization of government behavior and enterprise behavior must be accompanied by the rationalization of resident behavior. To this end, we should consult with the masses on everything, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. Rigid consumption expansion and income comparison are one of the most difficult problems to solve in economic work, but as long as the leading cadres at all levels truly do their best to be honest and dedicated, share weal and woe with the masses, and combined with extensive and in-depth propaganda and education, the problem can be solved.

	We should believe that as long as we adhere to the Party's basic line, adhere to the pragmatic style, and summarize the positive and negative experiences and lessons, we will be fully capable of overcoming the current difficulties and making the national economy gradually move onto the broad path of sustainable, stable, and coordinated development.

    关于持续、稳定、协调发展的一些思考
    李成瑞
    十年改革开放取得了举世公认的巨大成就，但由于这几年工作中的某些失误，也出现了经济过热、通货膨胀等问题。要经过一个严峻的困难时期，搞好治理整顿与深化改革，才能使国民经济走上持续、稳定、协调发展的坦途。为此，我们要冷静地思考一下：我国国民经济为什么一次又一次地出现大的波动？如何才能避免大起大落，实现国民经济持续、稳定、协调的发展？
    大起大落的症结在于大起，大起的来源在于发展上的脱离实际、急于求成。1982年党的十二大制定的本世纪内我国社会主义建设的发展战略，要求“在不断提高经济效益的前提下，力争使全国工农业的年总产值翻两番”；战略重点是加强“农业、能源、交通、教育和科学这几个根本环节”；战略部署是分两步走：“前十年主要是打好基础，积累力量，创造条件，后十年要进入新的经济振兴时期”，就是“先慢后快”。当时设计的增长速度平均每年递增7.2％。这是符合党的十一届三中全会的实事求是的思想路线的，是一条持续、稳定、协调发展的道路。但在后来，主要是近几年实际执行中的某些失误而发生了偏差。产值的增长大大超过原来预计的速度，虽然成绩很大，但付出了两个巨大的代价：一是粮棉出现五年徘徊，其他战略重点也没有得到加强，加工工业却发展过快，比例关系失调；二是经济关系没有理顺，特别在流通领域出现了许多混乱现象。作为这两条的共同后果，是明显的通货膨胀与整体效益的下降。
    这次大的波动同过去“大跃进”和“文化大革命”、两年冒进引起的大起大落相比，在性质上或程度上是有所不同的。不过，也要看到它又有不少新的特点。其一，过去是政府一个短期行为造成的，这次是政府和企业两个短期行为造成的。这两个短期行为互相助长。其二，过去主要是积累膨胀，这次是积累膨胀加消费膨胀。这是两个短期行为的必然结果。因为两者都追求扩大投资，而企业的短期行为更侧重于扩大消费。其三，过去是重工业发展过快，轻工业滞后，这次是轻工业中某些高档耐用消费品超高速发展，重工业中的基础工业滞后。其四，过去没有或很少借外债，这次借外债比较多。举借外债，数量适当，运用得法，可以促进技术水平的提高，加快经济的发展；如果运用不当，甚至用于进口高档消费品和奢侈品，就会造成浪费和损失，增加还债的困难。其五，过去由于经济发展过快引起的比例失调、物资短缺等问题暴露得比较快，调整比较及时；这次有外债的缓冲，问题暴露得比较迟缓。本来，1984年第四季度开始出现通货膨胀，矛盾初步暴露出来，当时开始进行被称为“软着陆”的调整，实际上还没有“着陆”就更高地“起飞”了，直到1988年9月党的十三届三中全会决定实行治理整顿深化改革的方针后，才重新开始了经济调整。这同当时举借外债在一定程度上掩盖了国民收入使用额大于生产额的矛盾的尖锐性，是密切联系的。在借债高峰的时期，经济繁荣，“自我感觉良好”；到了还债高峰期，国民收入使用额显著小于国民收入生产额，过去积累起来的矛盾就集中地暴露出来。最后，应强调指出，过去几次大起大落时，经济实力比较薄弱，这次经济实力比过去显著增强，人民生活有了显著改善。这是10年来我国社会主义建设和改革的伟大成果，它为我们进行经济调整，搞好治理整顿与深化改革提供了比过去雄厚得多的物质基础。当然，在目前权力分散、利益主体多元化的格局下，如何把财力、物力集中起来，有计划地用于调整，还迫切需要全国上下统一认识，共同作出努力。
    今后如何避免再次出现国民经济的大波动呢？从根本上说，是要坚持党的基本路线，坚持实事求是，尊重客观规律。这涉及到十分广泛的问题。在这篇短文中，只就如何改变政府和企业的短期行为、力求按客观规律办事谈一点意见。我认为，克服这些短期行为，需要从端正思想路线和建立合理的经济机制两方面努力。多年的实践证明：这两方面是相辅相成的，任何只强调某一方面而忽视另一方面的做法，都是不可取的。具体说，主要有以下几条：
    ——对各级干部特别是领导干部认真进行实事求是思想路线的再教育。经济发展中急功近利、急于求成，体现着一种脱离我国国情国力的主观主义思潮。应当紧密结合我国历史上国民经济几次大起大落的经验教训，反对脱离我国实际、片面追求高速度的唯心主义和形而上学，牢固地树立调查研究、从实际出发的唯物主义思想，坚持在建设中“有所不为才能有所为”、“欲速则不达”、“过犹不及”等辩证思想。要充分认识我国社会主义建设的长期性、艰巨性和循序渐进的特点。领导干部要丢掉那种“在我的任期内留下显著政绩”的狭隘意识，努力养成“在我的任期内留下长劲和后劲”的伟大胸怀。
    ——切实实行经济决策的民主化、科学化、法制化。重大决策一定要集思广益，反复论证，多听不同意见。要开展关于政策的正负效应及负效应对策的全面研究。国民经济计划和财政预算一经权力机关通过，必须严格执行，不能任意修改和变动。对干部的考核应以政策和计划为标准，不能片面地以“速度越快越好”、“居民收入增长越多越好”为标准，对于不合理的快和多，不应给予鼓励，而应给予批评。舆论导向也要十分重视这个问题。
    ——大力加强和改善宏观经济管理。坚持需求与供给在总量上和结构上的平衡，首先要抓好财政、信贷、外汇和物资的平衡，紧紧把住财政、信贷两个口子，坚决防止国民收入的超额分配。要在坚持社会主义计划经济的前提下，把计划调节与市场调节结合起来。直接调节与间接调节要相互衔接，不能留下空隙，造成经济的无序运行。国家要集中掌握必要的财力、物力，作为宏观调控的“资本”。经济管理体制和财政管理体制，既要有利于调动各方面的积极性，又要有利于全国资源配置的优化。这是改革的重要内容。
    ——逐步改革与完善微观经济机制。通过深化改革，使企业既有激励机制，又有约束机制，改变负盈不负亏、诱发短期行为的机制，真正成为相对独立的、自负盈亏、自主经营的经济实体。要建立在国家计划指导下的、有正常秩序的市场，让企业在平等的条件下开展竞争，优胜劣汰。同时建立适合我国国情的待业保险制度，健全职业培养制度，保障社会的安定和劳动者素质的提高。
    ——在坚持对外开放的前提下，注意合理地有效地利用外资。举借外债要有统一的计划和严格的管理。借入资金应主要用于重点建设。在经营中不仅要创造高于利息的利润，而且要有一定的出口创汇能力，保证按期偿债。还要避免借债期与还债期过分集中给经济带来大的波动。
    ——教育广大干部和群众长期保持和发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的优良传统。政府行为和企业行为的合理化，必须有居民行为合理化与之相配合。为此，遇事要与群众商量，充分调动群众的积极性。刚性的消费膨胀、收入攀比是经济工作中最难解决的问题之一，但只要各级领导干部真正做到廉洁奉公、与群众同甘共苦，加上广泛深入地宣传教育，问题是可以解决的。
    应当相信，只要坚持党的基本路线，坚持实事求是的作风，总结正反两方面的经验教训，就完全有条件克服当前的困难，使国民经济逐步走上持续、稳定、协调发展的康庄大道。
