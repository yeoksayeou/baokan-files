	Drug trafficking has been rampant in France in recent years, with the number of drug users steadily increasing. Drug trafficking has become a serious social problem in France.

	According to statistics released by the French Customs Administration on the 17th, in the first 10 months of this year, there were 5,177 cases of drug trafficking and smuggling, 6,142 drug traffickers were arrested, and 9.9 tons of various drugs were seized. Among them, 76 kilograms were heroin, 794.5 kilograms were cocaine, over 8 tons were cannabis products, 2.457 kilograms were morphine, and 1.82 kilograms were opium.

	Due to social and economic pressures in France, some people lack confidence in their future and feel spiritually empty. In search of stimulation, they gradually start using drugs. According to statistics, there are approximately 900,000 drug users in France currently, including 150,000 heroin users and 100,000 cocaine users.

	Facing this serious social problem, some French sociologists have called on the authorities to take effective measures to stop the spread of this phenomenon.

　　法国贩毒活动猖獗
    新华社巴黎电　（记者茅瑞清）最近几年来，法国的吸毒人数不断增多，贩毒活动也随之猖獗起来，吸毒已成为法国目前严重的社会问题。
    据法国海关总局17日在此间发表的统计，今年头10个月，共发现贩毒和走私毒品5177次，抓获贩毒犯6142人，缴获各种毒品9.9吨，其中海洛因76公斤，可卡因794.5公斤、大麻制品8吨多、吗啡2.457公斤、鸦片1.82公斤。
    由于法国社会、经济问题的压力，一些人对生活前途缺乏信心，精神空虚，为寻求刺激，就逐步开始吸毒。据统计，目前法国有吸毒者约90万人，其中15万人吸海洛因、10万人吸可卡因。
    面对这一严重社会问题，一些法国社会学家呼吁当局采取有效措施，制止这种现象的蔓延。
