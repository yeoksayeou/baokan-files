The fragrance of autumn fruits is in the air. Qixia County, known for its abundant production of national light and green red banana apples, has recently introduced large quantities of high-quality apples such as Red Fuji and New Red Star. This is the result of the county's large-scale renovation of existing orchards using new technologies. This county, which has the highest fruit production in the country, is expected to produce 250 million kilograms of apples this year, with an 80% rate of high-quality fruit.

Qixia County, the main production area for "Yantai Apples," is a mountainous region located in the optimal area for apple cultivation in China. It currently has 314,000 mu (approximately 21,000 hectares) of orchards. Facing the rapid development of the fruit industry nationwide in recent years, the county has recognized that quality will be a key factor in future market competition. While focusing on increasing production, the county has shifted its main efforts towards improving fruit quality. It established a Fruit Tree Technology Development Center staffed with 56 professional technicians. Experts from Japan, the United States, the Netherlands, and various domestic institutions have been invited to Qixia to share new technologies. Since 1987, the county has undertaken comprehensive technological renovations of old varieties, including soil improvement, tree pruning, covering cultivation, scientific fertilization, annual pruning, pollination during the flowering period, thinning of flowers and fruits, timely harvesting, and comprehensive pest and disease control. The experimental orchard's yield per mu has increased from 1,361 kilograms in 1987 to 2,364 kilograms this year. At the same time, a number of new varieties have been introduced from abroad. Since 1984, 61 new varieties, including the Fuji series, intermediate series, short-branch fourth-generation series, and the third-generation American New Red Star and Beidou, have been introduced, establishing 110,000 mu of high-quality, high-yield orchards. Currently, the yield per mu for 4-year-old dwarf Fuji apples is 1,750 kilograms, and for 4-year-old New Red Star apples, it is 2,000 kilograms, setting a new national record.

The Qixia County Committee and County Government have also addressed issues such as farmers harvesting too early, trading units raising prices, chaotic circulation, and occasional adulteration, which have affected the reputation of the fruit. They have strengthened the management of apple sales quality, establishing a fruit wholesale market in the county to facilitate direct transactions between producers and consumers, ensuring quality and price transparency, and eliminating discrepancies between quality and price. In recent years, the county has built three high-standard fruit cold storage facilities and four natural cold storage facilities, with a total storage capacity of over 30,000 tons. This year, it has also introduced the country's first set of advanced fruit pre-cooling and grading equipment from abroad, which is at the international advanced level of the 1980s. These measures have significantly enhanced the market competitiveness of Qixia apples.

    学习新技术  引进新品种
    栖霞县大规模改造果园
    年产两亿多公斤  优质果品占八成
    本报讯　金秋果香。往日素以盛产国光、青红香蕉苹果著称的山东省栖霞县，近日首次大批上市红富士、新红星等高档优质苹果。这是该县采用新技术对原有果园进行大规模改造的成果。这个全国果品产量第一大县，今年可总产苹果2.5亿公斤，优质果率达80％。
      “烟台苹果”的主要产地栖霞县，是个纯山区，地处我国苹果栽植的最佳区域，现有果园31.4万亩。面对近几年全国果品大发展的形势，这个县较早看到，质量将是主导未来市场的重要因素。他们在抓丰产的同时，把主要力量转向提高果品质量，专门成立了一个配备56名专业技术人员的果树技术开发中心。日本、美国、荷兰和国内的数十名果树专家先后应邀到栖霞传授新技术。从1987年起，对老品种进行了改良土壤、整修树盘、覆盖栽培、科学施肥、周年修剪、花期授粉，疏花疏果、适期采收和综合防治病虫等配套技术改造。试验区果园亩产由1987年的1361公斤，增加到今年的2364公斤。与此同时，一批新品种陆续从国外引进。自1984年以来，共引进矮化砧富士系列、中间砧系列、短枝型四代系列、三代的美国新红星、北斗等新品种61个，建立优质高产果园11万亩。如今，4年生乔化红富士亩产达1750公斤，4年生新红星亩产达2000公斤，创国内最高纪录。
    栖霞县委、县政府还针对近两年果农过早下树、经营单位抬价抢购、流通环节混乱、偶有掺杂使假现象出现，果品声誉下降的问题，加强对苹果销售质量管理，县里建立了果品中心批发市场，使产销直接见面，当面按质论价，杜绝了质价不符现象。近几年县里建立起高标准的果品冷风库3座、自然冷风库4处，贮藏总量达3万余吨；今年又从国外引进全国第一套具有80年代国际先进水平的水果预冷分级设备。采取这些措施使栖霞苹果在市场上的竞争力大大增强。
