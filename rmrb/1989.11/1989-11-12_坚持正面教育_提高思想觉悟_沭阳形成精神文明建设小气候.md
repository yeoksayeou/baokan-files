The Stiyang County Committee in Jiangsu Province has launched a positive education campaign among all party members and cadres, adhering to party principles, raising ideological awareness, and wholeheartedly serving the people, achieving noticeable results.

First, the county committee organized an exhibition titled "Stiyang in the Course of Reform" to showcase the significant changes brought about by reform and opening up in Stiyang's economy, science, and culture. Simultaneously, the county compiled the stories of 31 outstanding communists, labor models, and excellent entrepreneurs from various fronts over the past decade of reform into a book titled "Stiyang New Figures" and distributed it, calling on all party members, cadres, and the masses to learn from them.

To pass the "power test," the county discipline inspection commission formulated regulations such as "Party members and cadres maintaining integrity," serving as behavioral norms for communists. The county bureau of industry and commerce also displayed the names, positions, and photos of section-level and above cadres in a showcase for public supervision. The former director of the grain office in Nanguan Township, Ding Xiangcheng, embezzled 4,800 yuan and helped grain speculators purchase 112,500 pounds of grain. The county discipline inspection commission and supervision bureau reported this typical case to the entire county, tracing the roots of his crimes, and enhancing party members' and cadres' awareness of resisting corruption.

    坚持正面教育　提高思想觉悟
    沭阳形成精神文明建设小气候
    本报讯　江苏省沭阳县委在全县党员干部中开展正面教育，坚持党性原则，提高思想觉悟，全心全意为人民服务，收到明显效果。
    首先，县委举办《改革前进中的沭阳》成果展览，用大量事实反映改革、开放给沭阳的经济、科技、文化带来的巨大变化。同时，将改革10年来各条战线上的31名优秀共产党员、劳动模范、出色企业家的事迹汇编成《沭阳新人物志》一书下发，号召全县党员干部和广大群众向他们学习。
    为过好“权力关”，县纪委制定了“党员干部保持清廉”等规章制度，作为共产党员的行为规范，县工商局还把股级以上干部的姓名、职务、照片贴在橱窗内展出，接受群众监督。原南关乡粮所所长丁相成索贿4800元和替粮贩子套购112500斤原粮，县纪委、监察局抓住这个典型案例通报全县，寻找其犯罪的根源，增强了党员干部抵御腐蚀的自觉性。
