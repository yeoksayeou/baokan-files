The manager of Tuopai Liquor Factory in Shuanghong County, Sichuan Province, Li Jiasun, has devoted immense effort to the improvement and development of Tuopai Liquor, leading it to become a nationally renowned brand and the top producer in Sichuan. At 38 years old, Li Jiasun is a robust individual. He has previously served as a procurement officer, manager of the county sugar and liquor company, and deputy director of the county commerce bureau. The wave of reform propelled him to the position of manager and party secretary of Tuopai Liquor Factory, where he led the entire workforce to perform a "Song of Tuopai Liquor."

In 1988, compared to 1980, the factory's fixed assets increased from 350,000 yuan to 15,567,000 yuan. Annual liquor production rose from 200.9 tons to 42,800 tons. Annual output value increased from 566,000 yuan to 60,228,000 yuan. The factory turned losses into profits, achieving a profit of 12,886,000 yuan. Tax payments increased from 226,000 yuan to 5,186,000 yuan. The once-obscure Tuopai Liquor gained significant fame: in 1980, it first won the title of "Sichuan Famous Liquor." In 1983 and 1984, it received the "Quality Product" certificate from the Ministry of Commerce. In 1985, it won the "Golden Cup Award" from the Ministry of Commerce. Last September, at the 6th International Food Exhibition in Hong Kong, it won the International Gold Bottle Award. In the same year, April, the new production technology for the Tuopai series of liquors won the Invention Award at the Geneva International Exposition. Currently, the Tuopai series of products covers 500-plus sales points in 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions nationwide, and is highly favored by consumers. Over the years, manager Li Jiasun has received numerous honors, including "Outstanding Party Member" and "Outstanding Entrepreneur" of Suining City, and the "May Day Labor Medal" of the nation.

Tuopai Liquor Factory is located on the banks of the Fujiang River in Liu Tree Tuo of Shuanghong County. This place is known for its clear waters, pleasant climate, and a thousand-year history of brewing. The famous poet Du Fu, upon passing through here, left behind the line, "The spring wine of Shuanghong remains green even in the cold." In modern times, the brewing family Li Jianan used the spring water from Longchi and Qinglong Mountains, inherited the traditional brewing techniques of Chunjiu Wine, and carefully brewed Tuopai Liquor. After liberation, the Li family workshop was transformed into a state-owned enterprise. However, due to outdated equipment, a few dilapidated rooms, and an old hand-cranked well, the factory saw little development and suffered annual losses.

In the early 1980s, the young and energetic Li Jiasun took over as the manager of Tuopai Liquor Factory, determined to make a significant impact and revive the Tuopai Liquor brand.

Li Jiasun conducted thorough investigations of the production situation in the workshops and formulated a "per-ton liquor quality wage system" aimed at encouraging increased production and higher quality. This system determined the wage per ton of liquor based on "yield, quality, and consumption," linking workers' income closely to both the quantity and quality of liquor produced, thereby breaking the "iron rice bowl" distribution system.

After mobilizing the workers' enthusiasm, Li Jiasun faced the challenge of ensuring Tuopai Liquor Factory's competitiveness in the fierce market of nearly 10,000 liquor factories in Sichuan. He discovered from market research that many factories were focusing on high-end, premium liquors, neglecting the vast market for low-end, high-quality liquors. He reasoned that high-end liquors had high costs, were difficult to produce, had high prices, and limited sales. On the other hand, low-end liquors had low costs, were affordable, and suited the consumption habits of the majority of manual laborers. Why not focus more on this area? The factory's past losses were mainly due to neglecting the development of low-end liquors.

With this in mind, the factory adopted a development strategy of "high-end quality creation for fame, low-end market domination."

To develop low-end liquors, they discovered through practice that the leftover mash from brewing Tuopai Liquor still contained 12% residual starch, which was previously used to feed pigs. Could this mash be reused to brew low-end liquors? Li Jiasun and engineers like Yue Guangrong and Ma Jimi conducted repeated research and adjustments, adding edible alcohol to the mash for flavoring, fermentation, and distillation. They successfully produced a unique, low-end Tuopai Liquor priced at over one yuan per bottle. In 1980, 180 tons were produced and sold out immediately, showing significant economic benefits. Subsequently, Li Jiasun, along with the engineers, made technical adjustments to the original formula, improving the quality of the low-end Tuopai Liquor. In 1985, it won the "Golden Cup Award" in Sichuan Province and became the factory's flagship product. In the previous year's total production of 42,800 tons of liquor, low-end liquor accounted for 31,700 tons, becoming the main profit-generating product.

Good water brews good liquor. Li Jiasun realized early on that for Tuopai Liquor to develop significantly, relying on a single hand-cranked ancient well was insufficient. Water resources needed to be developed. In 1984, the higher authorities allocated 1.6 million yuan for technical upgrades. At the time, funds were needed for factory buildings, warehouses, wells, and dormitories. Li Jiasun decisively allocated 860,000 yuan to drill a large well in the Fujiang River.

The news met with opposition from some quarters. Some said Li Jiasun was overly ambitious, while others called it a waste of resources. With the support of higher authorities, Li Jiasun withstood the pressure, mobilizing the entire workforce to divert the Fujiang River in the bitter cold. After more than two months, they drilled a well with a diameter of 6 meters and a depth of 15 meters in the riverbed. The well's surroundings, covering 100 square meters, were entirely sealed with reinforced concrete and named "Tuoquan." The well produced 5,000 tons of water daily, clear and transparent, laying the foundation for the significant development of Tuopai Liquor. Professor Wang Shichang from the Chemistry Department of Tianjin University, after an inspection, praised the water quality of Tuoquan as meeting the standards of mineral water.

　　沱牌酒歌
　　本报记者　罗茂城
    四川省射洪县沱牌曲酒厂厂长李家顺，为沱牌酒的创优、发展，直到跻身国家名酒行列，产量雄居川酒之冠，费尽了心机。
    今年38岁的李家顺，身材壮实。他先后当过采购员、县糖酒公司经理、县商业局副局长。改革的大潮，又把他推到沱牌曲酒厂厂长兼党委书记的位置，带领全厂职工，演出一曲
  “沱牌酒歌”。
    这家酒厂1988年与1980年相比：固定资产从35万元增加到1556.7万元；年产酒从200.9吨提高到4.28万吨；年产值从56.6万元增加到6022.8万元；扭转亏损，实现利润已达1288.6万元；上缴税金从22.6万元增加到518.6万元。
    昔日声誉平平的沱牌曲酒，几年间名声大了：1980年首次荣获“四川名酒”称号。1983年和1984年荣获商业部“优质产品”证书。1985年捧回商业部颁发的“金爵奖”。去年9月，在香港第6届国际食品展览会上，荣获国际金瓶奖。同年4月，沱牌系列酒生产新工艺在日内瓦国际博览会上荣获发明奖。现在，沱牌系列产品的覆盖面已达全国29个省、市、自治区的500多个网点，深受消费者欢迎。几年来，厂长李家顺获得的荣誉称号有：遂宁市优秀党员、优秀企业家和全国“五一”劳动奖章。
    沱牌酒厂位于射洪县涪江边上的柳树沱。这里山清水秀，气候温和，有一千多年的酿酒历史。杜甫当年路过这里品酒，曾留下“射洪春酒寒仍绿”的佳句。近代酿酒世家李吉安，吸龙池、青龙二山交汇的沱泉水，承春酒传统酿造工艺，精心酿出沱牌曲酒。解放后，李氏作坊改为国营。但由于设备简陋，几间破房，一口手摇古井，终无多大发展，酒厂年年亏损。
    80年代初，年轻气盛的李家顺出任沱牌酒厂厂长后，决心大展鸿图，重振沱酒。
    李家顺深入车间，对生产情况反复考查，制定了一套旨在鼓励人们多酿酒、多出好酒的
  “吨酒质量工资制”，即按“出酒率、质量和消耗”来确定每吨酒的工资额。把职工收入与产酒多少特别是质量紧密联系，从而打破了
  “大锅饭”分配制度。
    工人的积极性调动起来后，如何使沱牌酒厂在四川近万家酒厂的激烈竞争中立于不败之地，成了李家顺日夜琢磨的问题。他从市场调查中了解到，现在许多酒厂不惜工本创高档优质酒，而放弃了低档优质酒的广阔市场。他想，高档名酒成本高，酿制困难，售价偏高，销路有限；而低档酒成本低，一二元一瓶，符合广大体力劳动者的消费习惯，为什么不能在这方面多花点功夫呢？沱牌酒厂过去亏损，主要亏在放弃发展低档酒上。
    有鉴于此，厂里制定了“高档创优争名，低档占领市场”的发展战略。
    如何发展低档酒呢？他们通过实践发现，酿制沱牌曲酒的酒糟，尚含有12％的残留淀粉，过去往往把酒糟拿去喂猪。能否利用这酒糟进行再加工，酿造低档酒呢？李家顺和岳光荣、马继苗等工程技术人员经过反复研究、调配，在酒糟里加上食用酒精进行串香、发酵、蒸馏，终于生产出了一种风味独特的一元多一瓶的沱牌酒。1980年生产180吨，立即行销一空，经济效益显著。此后，李家顺又与工程技术人员一道，对原配方作了技术上的调整，使低档沱牌酒质量又有提高，1985年获得四川省
  “金杯奖”，并成为全厂的当家产品。在去年总产4.28万吨酒中，低档酒达3.17万吨，成为主要盈利的品种。
    好水酿好酒。李家顺早就看出，沱牌酒要大发展，单靠一口手摇古井是无能为力的，必须大力开发水源。1984年，上级给该厂拨来160万元技改经费。当时又要修厂房、建库房，又要打水井，盖宿舍。李家顺当机立断，决定拨出86万元，到涪江里打一口大型水井。
    消息传出，立即遭到某些人的反对。有的说李家顺好大喜功，有的说这是劳民伤财。在上级领导的支持下，李家顺顶住种种压力，动员全厂职工，冒着严寒拦断涪江，令江水改道。前后花了两个多月，在涪江河床下面打了一口直径6米、深15米的水井，水井上面周围100平方米全部用钢筋水泥封闭，取名“沱泉”。水井日产5000吨，水质清澈透明，为沱牌酒大发展奠定了基础。天津大学化学系教授王世昌考察以后，盛赞沱泉水质达到了矿泉水标准。
