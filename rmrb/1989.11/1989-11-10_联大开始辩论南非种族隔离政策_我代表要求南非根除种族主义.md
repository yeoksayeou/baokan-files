Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, November 7th

The UN General Assembly today began debating South Africa's apartheid policy, and the Pretoria regime once again faced strong condemnation from the speakers present.

In his speech representing the Non-Aligned Movement, Yugoslavia's representative Dragoslav Pejich pointed out that in South Africa, where blacks make up 85% of the population, the state of emergency law is still in effect, anti-apartheid activities are still prohibited, and people yearning for freedom are still being persecuted. The apartheid system has not been eliminated.

According to a UN report, in the recent struggle of the South African people against apartheid, more than 1,000 people have been arrested, more than 20 people have been killed, and many have been injured.

In his speech, India's representative Verendra Gupta called for extensive economic sanctions against South Africa to force the South African authorities to abandon their apartheid policy and release all political prisoners, including Nelson Mandela.

The deputy chairman of the UN Special Committee Against Apartheid, Lana, called for continued pressure on the South African authorities. He said in his speech that the recent release of a few political prisoners by the South African authorities is still far from the international community's demand for the South African authorities to implement reforms.

Approximately 50 countries' representatives have signed up to speak during the three-day debate.

Our correspondent Liu Kai Chen reports from the UN, November 7th: Chinese representative Ambassador Yu Mengjia today called on the international community to continue to exert strong pressure and effective sanctions on the South African authorities, to actively support and strongly assist the struggle of the South African people, until the struggle to eliminate the apartheid system is finally victorious.

Yu Mengjia said that the Chinese government and people have always firmly supported the South African people's just struggle against apartheid.

Yu Mengjia pointed out that recently, the South African authorities have made some changes in their domestic and foreign policies, but they have not yet indicated that they will truly abandon the apartheid policy. The minority white far-right conservative forces are still trying every means to maintain their privileges.

He called on the South African authorities to recognize the situation, follow the historical trend and the demands of the broad South African people, and immediately abolish the apartheid system and all laws and decrees of racial discrimination.

Yu Mengjia also called on the South African authorities to immediately and unconditionally release black leader Mandela and all political prisoners, lift the state of emergency nationwide, lift the ban on the African National Congress of South Africa and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania, and engage in dialogue with them on the complete elimination of the apartheid system and the establishment of a democratic, free, and racially equal South Africa.

    联大开始辩论南非种族隔离政策 
    我代表要求南非根除种族主义
    新华社联合国11月7日电  （记者雷力利）联大今天开始辩论南非的种族隔离政策，比勒陀利亚政权再次受到与会发言者的强烈谴责。
    南斯拉夫代表德拉戈斯拉夫·佩伊奇在代表不结盟运动的发言中指出，在黑人占人口总数85％的南非，紧急状态法仍在实行，反对种族隔离的活动仍被禁止，渴望自由的人们仍遭迫害，种族隔离制度远未消除。
    据联大的一份报告表明，在南非人民最近反对种族隔离的斗争中，有1000多人被捕，20多人被打死，许多人被打伤。
    印度代表韦兰德拉·古普塔在发言中呼吁对南非实行广泛的经济制裁，以迫使南非当局放弃种族隔离政策，释放包括纳尔逊·曼德拉在内的所有政治犯。
    联合国反种族隔离特别委员会代主席拉纳要求继续向南非当局施加压力。他在发言中说，南非当局最近释放几名政治犯离国际社会要求南非当局实行改革的目标还相差很远。
    大约50个国家的代表报名在三天的辩论中发言。
    本报联合国11月7日电　记者刘开宸报道：中国代表俞孟嘉大使今天在第44届联合国大会上呼吁国际社会继续对南非当局施加强大的压力和有效的制裁，继续对南非人民的斗争给予积极支持和大力援助，直到消除种族隔离制度的斗争取得最后胜利。
    俞孟嘉说，中国政府和人民一贯坚决支持南非人民反对种族隔离的正义斗争。
    俞孟嘉指出，最近，南非当局的内外政策有了一些改变，但是还没有表示要真正放弃种族隔离政策，少数白人极右翼保守势力仍旧在千方百计维护他们的特权。
    他呼吁南非当局认清形势，顺应历史潮流和广大南非人民的要求，立即废除种族隔离制度和一切种族歧视的法律和法令。
    俞孟嘉还呼吁南非当局立即无条件释放黑人领袖曼德拉及一切政治犯，解除全国紧急状态，取消对南非非洲人国民大会和阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会等的禁令，并与它们就彻底消除种族隔离制度，建立一个民主、自由和种族平等的南非对话。
