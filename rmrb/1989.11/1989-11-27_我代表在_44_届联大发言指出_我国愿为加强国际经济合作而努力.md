China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Li Luyue, recently spoke at the 44th session of the UN General Assembly commemorating the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). He stated, "China is willing to work with all countries to promote international trade and development, and to strengthen international economic cooperation."

Li Luyue said, "In the 1980s, developed countries experienced the longest post-war economic growth period. However, for most developing countries, the 1980s was a lost decade for development. Their external economic environment deteriorated, trade protectionism rose, primary commodity prices stagnated, debt burdens were heavy, capital outflow was severe, and the gap between the North and the South widened further. Therefore, in the next 10 years, strengthening international economic cooperation, restoring economic growth and development in developing countries, and achieving stable development of the world economy are arduous tasks facing the international community."

Li Luyue hoped that all member states would support the work of UNCTAD to promote the development of developing countries and contribute to the global economic recovery.

Li Luyue finally stated that China, as a developing country, has always insisted on working with other developing countries to strive unremittingly for a new international economic order. China is also a member of UNCTAD and will, as always, strengthen close cooperation with UNCTAD and develop economic and trade relations with all countries in the world.

　　我代表在44届联大发言指出
　　我国愿为加强国际经济合作而努力
    本报联合国电　记者刘开宸报道：中国常驻联合国代表李鹿野大使最近在第44届联大纪念贸发会议成立25周年大会上发言，表示“中国愿意与各国一道，为促进国际贸易和发展，加强国际经济合作共同努力”。
    李鹿野说，“80年代，发达国家处于战后持续最长的经济增长时期。然而对多数发展中国家来说，80年代却是失去发展的10年，其经济发展的外部环境恶化，贸易保护主义上升，初级产品价格疲软，债务负担沉重，资金倒流严重，南北差距进一步扩大。因此，在今后10年里，加强国际经济合作，恢复发展中国家的经济增长和发展，以达到世界经济的稳定发展，是国际社会面临的艰巨任务”。
    李鹿野希望所有成员国都支持贸发会议的工作，为促进发展中国家的发展，为全球经济的振兴作出贡献。
    李鹿野最后表示，中国作为发展中国家，一贯坚持同其他发展中国家一起为建立国际经济新秩序作出不懈的努力。中国又是贸发会议的成员，将一如既往地加强与贸发会议的密切合作，发展同世界各国的经济和贸易关系。
