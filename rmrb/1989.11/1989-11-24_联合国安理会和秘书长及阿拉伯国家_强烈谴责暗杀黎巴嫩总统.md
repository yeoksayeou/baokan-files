The United Nations Security Council and Secretary-General, as well as Arab states, strongly condemn the assassination of the Lebanese President

    BEIJING, Nov. 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security Council today strongly condemned the terrorist act of assassinating Lebanon's new President Rene Moawad in Beirut.

    This was stated in a declaration issued after a meeting of the Security Council presided over by Li Luweng, China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations.

    The declaration pointed out that this criminal act is an attack on Lebanon's unity, democratic process and national reconciliation.

    The Security Council solemnly reaffirmed its support for the Taif Agreement on a peaceful settlement of the Lebanese crisis and called on all Lebanese to exercise restraint and continue their efforts for national reconciliation in Lebanon.

    United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar also issued a statement today strongly condemning this barbaric assassination. He pointed out that the perpetrators are attempting to destroy the bright prospects for Lebanon's unity, as this tragedy occurred at a time when violence in Lebanon was expected to end.

    Perez de Cuellar called on the Lebanese people not to resort to further violence but to unite and strive for the restoration of Lebanon's unity.

    The 44th President of the United Nations General Assembly, Joseph Garba, also issued a statement expressing shock and sorrow over this assassination.

    He pointed out that this unfortunate incident further shows that Lebanon's political problems urgently need a peaceful solution, and he hoped that all parties concerned would redouble their efforts to seek peace in Lebanon.

    CAIRO, Nov. 22 (Xinhua) -- The assassination of Lebanon's new President Rene Moawad on Nov. 22 has aroused strong reactions in the Arab world.

    Lebanese Prime Minister Selim Hoss issued a broadcast strongly condemning the assassination of Moawad. He said, "The criminals have killed a great man, but they cannot kill the desire for national reconciliation in the hearts of the vast majority of Lebanese people."

    Arab League Secretary-General Chedli Klibi called on the Lebanese people to exercise restraint and beware of falling into the traps set by those who want to sabotage Lebanon's national reconciliation.

    The Syrian News Agency reported that the assassination of President Moawad is a "criminal act against the legitimate government of Lebanon."

    The Middle East News Agency quoted an Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying that Egypt strongly condemns the terrorist act of assassinating President Moawad and urges the Lebanese people to remain united in this critical moment when the President has been assassinated.
