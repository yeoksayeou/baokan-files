Xinhua News Agency, Panama City, November 21st.

Panama's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the 21st, strongly condemning the actions of over a hundred U.S. Southern Command personnel who, on the 20th and 21st, used tanks and rocket launchers to impose an armed blockade on the areas housing the U.S. Gorgas Hospital, the Panamanian Ministry of Health, and the offices of the judicial and other departments located in the Canal Zone.

The statement pointed out that this U.S. action is aimed at creating a pretext for its armed intervention in Panama's full exercise of sovereignty and is a blatant violation of the new Canal Treaty signed by Panama and the U.S. in 1977.

　　巴拿马谴责美国军事威胁
    巴拿马外交部二十一日发表公报，强烈谴责美国南方司令部一百多名官兵二十日和二十一日使用坦克和火箭炮对位于运河区的美国戈尔加斯医院、巴拿马卫生部、司法等部门的办公室所在地区实行武装封锁。
    公报指出，美这一行径是为其武装干涉巴拿马全面行使主权制造借口，也是对巴、美一九七七年签署的新运河条约的公然破坏。
