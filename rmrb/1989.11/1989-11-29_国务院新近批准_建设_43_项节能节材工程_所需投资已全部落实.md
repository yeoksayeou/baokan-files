Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 28th.

The State Council recently approved the construction of 43 small-scale energy-saving and material-saving projects, marking the first time it has directly reviewed and approved such projects. This information was obtained from the Energy-Saving Company of the State Energy Investment Corporation.

According to Huaili Tian, deputy general manager of the Energy-Saving Company, the state places great importance on energy and material conservation to meet the needs of national economic development. Despite the current efforts to reduce the scale of construction projects, the state continues to prioritize the energy and material industries. The nation's energy-saving investments for this year remain at last year's level. The 8.5 billion yuan required for the 43 newly approved small-scale energy-saving projects has been fully secured, with the Energy-Saving Company of the State Energy Investment Corporation contributing 3.5 billion yuan and local governments raising 5 billion yuan.

The energy-saving and material-saving construction projects that began in 1989 include heating power plants, recovery of flammable gases for civilian use, steel conservation, energy-saving demonstrations, rural energy, and comprehensive utilization demonstration projects. Once completed and operational, these projects will add 135,000 kilowatts of heating and power generation capacity to the country, generating approximately 670 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually and saving 550,000 tons of coal. They will also recover approximately 1.1 billion cubic meters of flammable gases annually and save 500,000 tons of steel. Additionally, these projects will significantly reduce environmental pollution, yielding substantial economic and social benefits.

　　国务院新近批准
　　建设43项节能节材工程
　　所需投资已全部落实
    新华社北京11月28日电　（记者赵明亮、通讯员王显光）从国家能源投资公司节能公司获悉，国务院新近第一次直接审查批准新建、改建、扩建43项小型节能、节材工程。
    据节能公司副总经理怀力田介绍，为满足国民经济发展的需要，国家非常重视能源、原材料节约工作。在目前大力压缩基建规模的情况下，对能源、原材料工业实行倾斜政策。今年国家的节能投资仍维持去年水平。新近批准的43项小型节能项目所需的8.5亿元投资也已全部落实，其中国家能源投资公司节能公司投资3.5亿元，地方自筹投资5亿元。
    1989年开工的这些节能、节材基建项目包括供热电站、回收放散可燃气供民用、节约钢材、节能示范、农村能源及综合利用示范等工程。建成投产后，可使我国新增供热发电装机13.5万千瓦，年发电量约6.7亿度，节煤55万吨；每年约可回收放散可燃气体1.1亿立方米；每年节约钢材5万吨；同时还可大大减少环境污染，经济效益和社会效益均相当可观。
