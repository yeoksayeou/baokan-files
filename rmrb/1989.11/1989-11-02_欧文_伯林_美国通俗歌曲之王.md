The renowned American violinist Stern once said, "American music was born on Irving Berlin's piano."

Over more than half a century, Irving wrote over 1,500 songs. Whether in Hollywood, on Broadway, in military camps, churches, or on the streets, his songs could be heard everywhere.

It was he who ended the dominance of Gilbert and Sullivan's British music and Italian opera on American stages, concluding the long period of European music monopolizing America, and giving America its own music. President Bush said, "His songs have become a part of American life, deeply ingrained in the lives of several generations of Americans."

Irving was born on May 11, 1888, in the Russian city of Tyumen to a Jewish family. At the age of five, he moved with his father to New York. However, in this "paradise," the only place they could settle was in the slums of the East Side. Just three years after arriving in the new country, his father passed away. Consequently, Irving, having only attended two years of elementary school, took on the responsibility of supporting his mother and six siblings. He sold newspapers on the streets, sang for tips, and guided the blind. At the age of fourteen, he finally found a job as a waiter and singer in a café in Chinatown. Here, every night after closing, he had the chance to play the piano.

At the age of nineteen, Irving wrote his first song, "Marie from Sunny Italy." This song brought him his current name, Irving Berlin, which was a typographical error by a typesetter who mistook Izzy Baline for Irving Berlin. This song also marked the beginning of his lifelong relationship with American music, from which point he not only wrote lyrics but also composed music.

At the age of twenty-three, he created "Alexander's Ragtime Band," which became his breakthrough hit. This song, based on the African American musical style of ragtime, quickly spread among white audiences. Within a few months, the song's records sold over a million copies. This song also earned him international fame. A few years later, during a performance in London, the audience dubbed him the "King of Ragtime."

"Watch Your Step" (1914) was his first song for a Broadway musical. "Annie Get Your Gun" (1946) is considered his most successful of the nineteen musicals he wrote. The play ran for 1,147 consecutive performances on Broadway that year. The song's record stayed at the top of the charts for ten weeks.

In 1935, Irving wrote the score for the musical "Top Hat," marking his first collaboration with Hollywood. Afterwards, he wrote scores for eighteen films. Among them, the song "White Christmas" from the 1942 film "Holiday Inn" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song that year. Since then, this song has been heard at various religious ceremonies.

Another notable song is "God Bless America," created in 1938. This song is well-known throughout America and is considered a patriotic anthem, often referred to as America's unofficial national anthem. "Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning" and "This Is the Army" were written after he enlisted. These songs have been widely popular in the military for many years. Irving never studied music theory, so he was not bound by it. His command of English was limited, but his lyrics were simple and straightforward, making them easy for everyone to sing and understand. Irving once said, "My ambition is to touch the hearts of ordinary people. My audience is not the highly educated nor the poorly educated. My audience is the true people, the soul of a nation." He found the right audience to serve, which might be the secret to his success. Who could have imagined that a foreigner who only attended two years of elementary school would bring such a significant change to American music; that someone who never received formal music education, who couldn't read or write music, would receive honorary doctorates in music from three universities; that a street singer would grow up to become the enduring king of popular songs.

Due to his contributions to American music, he received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, the Tony Special Award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Congressional Gold Medal, as well as the Legion of Honor from France.

Irving's career is filled with legendary stories, and his life is like a romantic tale. In 1962, he created "Mr. President," his last song. For the next thirty years, he lived a reclusive life, communicating with old friends only by phone. Even the centenary celebration held in his honor in 1988, he declined to attend. He did not want the audience to see him in his old age.

On September 22 of this year, Irving peacefully passed away in his sleep at the age of 101, concluding his extraordinary life. His achievements will forever be remembered in people's hearts.

    欧文·伯林
    ——美国通俗歌曲之王
    曹玉如
    美国著名小提琴家斯特恩说：“美国音乐是在欧文·伯林的钢琴上诞生的。”
    欧文在半个多世纪里，写了一千五百多首歌。无论是在好莱坞、百老汇、军营、教堂以至大街小巷，到处都能听到他的歌曲。
    是他，结束了吉尔伯特和沙利文的英国音乐和意大利歌剧充斥美国舞台的局面，结束了长期以来欧洲音乐垄断美国的时代，使美国有了自己的音乐。美国总统布什说：“他的歌已成为美国生活的一部分，深入到美国几代人的生活之中。”
    欧文一八八八年五月十一日出生于俄国秋明的一个犹太人家庭。五岁那年，随父亲携家来到纽约。但在这个他们的“理想天堂”里，只有东区贫民窟才是安家之地。到异乡后仅三年，父亲去世。因而，欧文只上了两年小学，便帮助母亲挑起养活七个弟妹的生活重担。他沿街叫卖报纸，在街头卖唱，为盲人引路……十四岁那年才在唐人街的一家咖啡厅找到一份工作——招待兼歌童。在这里，每天晚上打烊后，是他玩琴的好机会。
    十九岁时，欧文尝试着写下了有生以来的第一支歌《来自明媚意大利的玛丽》。这支歌为他带来了现在的名字欧文·伯林，这是排字工人错把Izzy　Baline排成Irving　Berlin造成的。这支歌还使他与美国音乐结下了不解之缘，从此，他不仅写词，还写曲。
    二十三岁时创作的《亚历山大·拉格泰姆乐队》是欧文的成名作。这首歌用黑人民歌拉格泰姆作基调，随着歌曲的流行，拉格泰姆等黑人音乐在白人中迅速流传。仅一两个月，这支歌的唱片就出售了一百多万张。这首歌还使他赢得国际声誉。几年后在伦敦演出时，观众称他为“拉格泰姆之王”。
    《盯着你的脚步》（一九一四年）是他为百老汇音乐剧谱写的第一首歌。而《安妮拿起你的枪》（一九四六年）是他十九部音乐剧中最成功的。该剧当年在百老汇就连续上演了一千一百四十七场。这首歌的唱片连续十周居于十佳唱片榜首。
    一九三五年，欧文为歌舞剧《大礼帽》谱写的插曲，是他与好莱坞的首次合作。以后，他为十八部影片写过插曲。其中一九四二年为《假日旅店》谱写的《白色圣诞节》获得了当年奥斯卡最佳音乐（歌曲）奖。从此，在各种大小宗教仪式上都能听到这首歌。
    这里，值得一提的还有一九三八年创作的《上帝赐福美国》，这首歌在美国家喻户晓，是一首鼓舞爱国热情的严肃歌曲，被誉为美国的非正式国歌。《我多么讨厌早上起床》和《这就是军队》是在他入伍后创作的。这些歌在军队里，多年来广为流传，经久不衰。他没有学过乐理，可以不受乐理的束缚。他掌握的英语不多，他的歌词简单明了，开门见山，人人能唱，个个都懂。欧文这样说过：“我的雄心在于打动普通人的心扉，我的听众既不是文化层次特别高的，也不是文化层次特别低的。我的听众是真正的人民，一个民族的真正灵魂。”他找到了正确的服务对象，这也许是他成功的秘诀。谁能想象，一个只读了两年小学的外乡人会给美国音乐带来这么大的变化；一个没有受过正规音乐教育，既不识谱，又不会记谱的人，却获得三所大学的音乐荣誉博士学位；一个在街头卖唱的歌童，长大了竟成为盛名不衰的通俗歌曲之王。
    由于他对美国音乐事业的贡献，他获得过格雷米终身成就奖、托尼特别奖、美国总统自由勋章和国会金质奖章，还获得过法国荣誉军团的勋位。
    欧文的事业充满传奇色彩，他的生活也像一部罗曼谛克故事。一九六二年创作的《总统先生》是欧文的最后一首歌。从此，三十多年来，他一直深居简出，靠电话与老朋友们联系。就连一九八八年纪念他百岁华诞的纪念会，欧文也谢绝出席。因为，他不愿观众看到自己老态龙钟的样子。
    今年九月二十二日，欧文平静安详地在熟睡中与世长辞，走完了自己一百零一岁的不平凡的生活历程。他的业绩将久远地留在人们的心里。
