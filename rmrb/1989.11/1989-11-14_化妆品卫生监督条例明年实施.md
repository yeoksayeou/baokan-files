People's Daily, Beijing, November 13th - Correspondent Ài Xiào reports: The first national regulation for supervising the hygiene safety of cosmetics in China, the "Regulations on the Supervision of Cosmetic Hygiene," approved and issued by the State Council, will be implemented on January 1, 1990.

Today, Minister of Health Chen Minzhang announced this information, stating that cosmetics, food, and even some medicines share similarities in meeting consumers' desires for maintaining beauty and health. For a long time, some producers have exploited this similarity to circumvent laws, producing items that are not cosmetics, falsely advertising various therapeutic effects, and selling them as cosmetics to evade national supervision. Unsafe cosmetics pose significant health risks to the public. Many consumers have paid a heavy price for pursuing beauty at the expense of their health. The implementation of this regulation marks the elevation of China's cosmetic hygiene supervision from administrative management to legal supervision and management.

    化妆品卫生监督条例明年实施
    本报北京11月13日讯　记者艾笑报道：经国务院批准颁布的我国监督化妆品卫生安全的第一部全国性法规——《化妆品卫生监督条例》将于明年1月1日实施。
    今天，卫生部长陈敏章在发布这一信息时说，化妆品、食品，甚至药品的某些功能在满足消费者希望保持健美方面有一些相似之处。长期以来，有的生产者利用这一特点钻法律的空子，生产不属于化妆品的产品，大肆宣传各种疗效，又作为化妆品销售，逃避国家监督。不安全的化妆品对群众健康的危害很大，由爱美导致损害健康的情况已使许多消费者付出了沉痛的代价。这个条例的实施，标志着我国的化妆品卫生监督已从行政管理上升到法制监督管理。
