    Focus on Quality Training and Boldly Select and Appoint
    Nationwide Minority Cadres Reach 1.84 Million

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 12th (Reporter: Zheng Qingdong) In the 40 years since the founding of the nation, the cadre teams of various ethnic minorities in China have continuously developed and grown. According to statistics from relevant departments, China currently has more than 1.84 million ethnic minority cadres, nearly 19 times more than in 1953.

    Actively cultivating, selecting, and appointing ethnic minority cadres who are both morally upright and talented is an important sign of ethnic minorities exercising their right to self-governance. After the founding of the nation, the Party and the state have paid great attention to the cultivation and use of ethnic minority cadres. On the one hand, they have adopted various forms such as party school training, in-depth study at ethnic minority colleges, and exchange and study in inland areas to strengthen the cultivation and assessment of ethnic minority talents. On the other hand, they have boldly used ethnic minority cadres in various fields, systems, and sectors in politics, economy, culture, and science and technology.

    The structure of the ethnic minority cadre team has also undergone a pleasant change in recent years, with the most prominent feature being the improvement of cultural level and the increase in the proportion of scientific and technological cadres and economic management cadres. According to statistics, by the end of last year, the number of ethnic minority professional and technical cadres nationwide had increased by nearly 40 times compared to 1957. Among ethnic minority cadres, those with a college, vocational, or high school education or above account for about 75%, and ethnic minority cadres under the age of 40 nationwide account for 62%, basically forming a team of ethnic minority cadres with a full range of talents.

    注重素质培养　大胆选拔任用
    全国少数民族干部达184万
    据新华社北京11月12日电  （记者郑庆东）建国40年来，我国各少数民族干部队伍不断发展壮大。据有关部门统计，目前我国共有少数民族干部184万多人，比1953年增加了近19倍。
    大力培养、选拔和使用德才兼备的少数民族干部，是我国少数民族实现当家作主权利的一个重要标志。建国后，党和国家十分重视对民族干部的培养和使用。一方面采取党校培训、民族院校深造、到内地交流学习等多种形式，加强对少数民族人才的培养和考察，一方面在政治、经济、文化、科技等各方面、各系统、各领域大胆使用少数民族干部。
    少数民族干部队伍的结构近年来也发生了可喜的变化，其突出表现是文化水平提高，科技干部和经济管理干部比重上升。据统计，到去年底，全国少数民族专业技术干部比1957年增加了近40倍。在少数民族干部中，大专、中专、高中以上文化程度的约占75％，全国40岁以下的民族干部占62％，已基本形成了一支人才齐备的少数民族干部队伍。
