    新华社莫斯科10月30日电　第七届世界杯技巧赛29日在苏联里加市结束。中国队以7枚金牌、4枚银牌、7枚铜牌的成绩名列第3。
    在全部7个项目的比赛中，苏联、保加利亚和中国3支队伍技高一筹，分别夺得了10枚、9枚和7枚金牌。美国、法国各夺一枚金牌。其余9支队伍与金牌无缘。
    中国福建运动员陈云和陈宝煌表现突出。他俩在男子双人项目中，夺得了第一套动作、第二套动作和全能3枚金牌。中国队的其余4枚金牌为安徽运动员刘瀚、蔡陈、许兵、任仕强在男子四人第一套动作中，上海运动员虞伟、陆美娟在女子双人第一套动作中，浙江运动员沈宏伟、李植在混双比赛中，广西运动员侯卿、颜伟霞、莫雪琼在女子三人第二套动作中所得。
    广东女运动员姚志华虽然在全能和第一套动作中只获得银牌，但却引起人们的注意。苏联队31岁的老将、在女子单人跳跃比赛中夺魁的格罗莫娃认为，姚志华的动作编排独特而令人赏心悦目，充分体现了中国技巧运动员的优点，苏联女运动员今后要认真对待这个强劲的对手。
