Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 9th.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping requests resignation from the chairmanship of the Central Military Commission.

After stepping down, he will continue to be loyal to the Party and the state's cause.

To the Central Politburo:

I request to resign from my current position as Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China.

In 1980, I proposed reforming the Party and state leadership systems to abolish the lifelong tenure of leading cadres. In recent years, many senior comrades have successively stepped down from central leadership positions. In 1987, before the convening of the 13th National Congress of the Party, in order to practice the abolition of lifelong tenure of leading cadres, I expressed my wish to retire. At that time, the Central Committee, after repeated consideration of my personal views and those of the Party and the country, decided to approve my resignation from the positions of Standing Committee member, Politburo member, and Chairman of the Central Advisory Commission, and to step down from the Central Committee and the Central Advisory Commission; it was decided that I would continue to hold the position of Chairman of the Military Commission of the Party and the state. Since then, when the central leadership collective consults me on major issues, I have always respected and supported the views of the majority of the central leadership collective. However, I have insisted on not interfering with daily work and have always hoped to complete the new-old replacement as soon as possible and realize the wish to completely step down from the leadership position.

The leadership core led by Comrade Jiang Zemin, elected at the 13th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, has already effectively carried out work. After careful consideration, I think that I should resign from my current position while I am still in good health to realize my long-cherished wish. This is beneficial to the cause of the Party, the state, and the army. I sincerely hope that the Central Committee will approve my request. I will also submit a request to the National People's Congress to resign from the position of Chairman of the State Military Commission.

As an old Party member and old citizen who has struggled for several decades for the cause of communism and for the independence, unity, construction, and reform of the country, my life belongs to the Party and to the country. After stepping down, I will continue to be loyal to the cause of the Party and the state. The achievements of our Party, our country, and our army are the result of the efforts of several generations. Our reform and opening-up cause has just begun, and the task is heavy and the road is long. There will still be some twists and turns ahead. But I firmly believe that we will be able to overcome all difficulties and carry forward the cause started by our predecessors from generation to generation. The Chinese people, who have the ability to stand up, will certainly be able to stand forever among the nations of the world.

    邓小平同志致信中央政治局请求辞去中央军委主席职务
    退下来以后将继续忠于党和国家的事业
    新华社北京十一月九日电　邓小平同志请求辞去中央军委主席职务的信中央政治局：
    我向中央请求辞去现在担任的中共中央军事委员会主席职务。
    一九八○年我就提出要改革党和国家的领导制度，废除干部领导职务终身制。近年来，不少老同志已相继退出了中央领导岗位。一九八七年，在党的第十三次全国代表大会召开以前，为了身体力行地废除干部领导职务终身制，我提出了退休的愿望。当时，中央反复考虑我本人和党内外的意见，决定同意我辞去中央政治局常委、中央政治局委员、中央顾问委员会主任的职务，退出中央委员会和中央顾问委员会；决定我留任党和国家的军委主席的职务。此后，当中央的领导集体就重大问题征询我的意见时，我也始终尊重和支持中央领导集体多数同志的意见。但是，我坚持不再过问日常工作，并一直期待着尽早完成新老交替，实现从领导岗位完全退下来的愿望。
    党的十三届四中全会选出的以江泽民同志为首的领导核心，现已卓有成效地开展工作。经过慎重考虑，我想趁自己身体还健康的时候辞去现任职务，实现夙愿。这对党、国家和军队的事业是有益的。恳切希望中央批准我的请求。我也将向全国人民代表大会提出辞去国家军委主席的请求。
    作为一个为共产主义事业和国家的独立、统一、建设、改革事业奋斗了几十年的老党员和老公民，我的生命是属于党、属于国家的。退下来以后，我将继续忠于党和国家的事业。我们党、我们国家和我们军队所取得的成就是几代人努力的结果。我们的改革开放事业刚刚起步，任重而道远，前进中还会遇到一些曲折。但我坚信，我们一定能够战胜各种困难，把先辈开创的事业一代代发扬光大。中国人民既然有能力站起来，就一定有能力永远岿然屹立于世界民族之林。
                                    邓小平
                          一九八九年九月四日
