At a time when the campaign against pornography and illegal publications is deepening, I was astonished to find two advertisements promoting "spiritual garbage" in a newspaper from the capital. In a book and magazine advertisement published by this newspaper at the end of September, among the 16 "mail-order bestsellers" introduced, there were books promoting feudal superstitions such as astrology and fortune-telling, as well as books teaching deceptive tricks. Another advertisement was even more shocking, filled with vulgar and obscene book titles that are unfit to be seen. Can a socialist newspaper publish such advertisements?!

    这种广告不能登
    正当“扫黄”不断深入之时，我却惊异地从首都某报的版面上，发现为“精神垃圾”广作宣传的两则广告。这家报纸在9月底的一则书刊广告上介绍的16种“邮购畅销书”里，既有宣扬封建迷信的星相、算命的书籍，又有传授骗人伎俩的读物。另一则广告更是充斥了低级黄色不堪入目的书名。社会主义的报纸能刊登这样的广告吗？！
