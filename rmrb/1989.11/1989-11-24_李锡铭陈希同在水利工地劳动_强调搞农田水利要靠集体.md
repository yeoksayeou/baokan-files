Li Ximing, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee, and Chen Xitong, a State Councilor and Mayor of Beijing, today came to the Li Pu agricultural water conservancy construction site in Juzhuang Township, Daxing County on the outskirts of Beijing to participate in labor.

At the 18-kilometer-long Chahe, more than 50 leaders from the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government, along with over 160,000 farmers, participated in the dredging project. Li Ximing said that it is impossible to rely on individual households to carry out agricultural water conservancy construction; it must rely on the collective power.

It is reported that from July 1 to November 22, the suburban areas of Beijing have mobilized 8 million man-days of labor and completed 17 million cubic meters of earthwork for agricultural water conservancy construction.

Chen Xitong said that without water conservancy, agriculture cannot be developed; without agriculture, everything else is out of the question. We must give full play to the advantages of the rural collective economy, let farmers benefit from agricultural water conservancy construction, and seriously implement the already formulated labor regulations and responsibility system to do a good job in the basic construction of agricultural water conservancy.

　　李锡铭陈希同在水利工地劳动
　　强调搞农田水利要靠集体
    新华社北京11月23日电　（记者王跃华）中共中央政治局委员、北京市委书记李锡铭，国务委员、北京市长陈希同今天来到京郊大兴县朱庄乡李堡农田水利建设工地参加劳动。
    在18公里长的岔河，北京市委、市政府50多名领导干部和1.6万多名农民一起参加清淤工程劳动。李锡铭说，搞农田水利建设靠一家一户是不可能的，必须依靠集体的力量。
    据悉，北京市郊区从7月1日到11月22日，已出工800万个，完成农田水利建设土方量1700万方。
    陈希同说，没有水利，农业就搞不好；没有农业，其他一切都无从谈起。要大力发挥农村集体经济的优势，让农民从农田水利建设中受益，并认真执行已制订的劳动法规和责任制，才能搞好农田水利基本建设。
