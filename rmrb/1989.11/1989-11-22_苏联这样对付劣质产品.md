The Soviet Union has been implementing state inspections on the products of certain enterprises for nearly three years. State inspections have achieved some effectiveness in reducing defective products and supervising quality. Currently, the methods and targets of this work are being adjusted to allow users and legal frameworks to play a greater role in quality supervision.

The Soviet Union faces a shortage of products, and the sale of substandard products exacerbates the shortage, leading to a vicious cycle. According to Soviet publications, the defect rates of domestically produced televisions, radios, clothing, shoes, and children's bicycles all exceed ten percent. Last year, the non-compliance rates of sampled food products such as meat, sausages, cheese, and candy ranged from 6.5% to 6.8%, while the non-compliance rates of fish products and margarine were 10% and 11.6%, respectively.

Since 1987, the Soviet Union has implemented state inspections on 1,500 enterprises, accounting for one-fifth of the national industrial output. Products are inspected according to national standards, and defective products are not allowed to leave the factory. In the first year, 6 billion rubles worth of substandard products were intercepted. The following year, state inspections were expanded to 2,300 enterprises, blocking 14 billion rubles worth of substandard products at the factory gates. In 1988, the amount of products returned for repair after leaving the factory decreased by 4.5 billion rubles compared to 1987. Residential buildings that underwent state inspections had almost no defects reported by residents.

However, state inspections are ultimately an administrative measure taken out of necessity. Out of the 46,000 enterprises nationwide, only 2,700 have implemented state inspections. Moreover, the decision on which enterprises to inspect is made by the relevant departments. To maintain their image, departments often implement state inspections on enterprises with high product quality to ensure they pass inspection, while enterprises with poor reputations continue to produce substandard goods. Food enterprises, which are crucial to public health, have not yet implemented state inspections. Many well-managed enterprises have seen their income affected by state inspections blocking substandard products, leading to dissatisfaction among workers.

Currently, the Soviet Union is improving the state inspection system. First, it shifts from inspecting final products to inspecting intermediate products at weak links, achieving twice the results with half the effort. Second, it leverages user supervision, quickly dispatching state inspection teams to factories producing substandard goods with the assistance of consumer associations; while for enterprises with stable product quality and positive user feedback, state inspections can be withdrawn. Third, the State Standardization Committee is authorized to formulate national product standards that comply with international standards, using legal frameworks to supervise product quality.

### 苏联这样对付劣质产品

　　苏联这样对付劣质产品
　　新华社记者　盛世良
    苏联对部分企业的产品实行国家验收已近三年。国家验收在减少废品、监督质量方面取得一定实效。目前这项工作的方式和对象在调整，要让用户和法制在质量监督方面发挥更大作用。
    苏联产品短缺，劣质产品销售不出，又加重了短缺，引起恶性循环。据苏联报刊透露，苏联产的电视机、收音机、服装、鞋、儿童自行车的废品率均超过百分之十。去年抽验的食品中，肉、香肠、奶酪、糖果的不合格率达百分之六点五至百分之六点八，鱼产品和人造黄油的不合格率分别为百分之十和百分之十一点六。
    一九八七年起，苏联对占全国工业产值五分之一的一千五百家企业的产品实行国家验收，根据国家标准检验产品，不准废品出厂，当年就挡住了六十亿卢布的不合格产品。第二年，国家验收扩大到二千三百个企业，把一百四十亿卢布的不合格品挡在厂门内。一九八八年，出厂后返修的产品比一九八七年减少四点五亿卢布，经过国家验收的住房，住户几乎挑不出毛病。
    但是，国家验收毕竟是迫不得已而采取的行政措施。全国四万六千个企业中，迄今也只有二千七百个企业实行国家验收。而且，哪些企业实行国家验收，全由主管的部来定。各部为保全体面，往往在产品质量高的企业实行国家验收，以求过关，用户怨声载道的坏企业照样放手生产劣等品。对事关人民健康的食品企业，迄今基本上没有实行国家验收。不少经营较好的企业由于国家验收挡住了不合格品，影响收入，职工不满。
    目前，苏联正在改进国家验收。一是由检验最终产品，改为检验薄弱环节的中间产品，事半功倍。二是发挥用户的监督作用，在消费者协会配合下，对生产劣质品的厂家，迅速派国家验收组进驻；而对产品质量稳定，用户反映好的企业，可撤销国家验收。三是国家标准化委员会受权制订符合国际标准的国家产品标准，让法制来监督产品质量。
