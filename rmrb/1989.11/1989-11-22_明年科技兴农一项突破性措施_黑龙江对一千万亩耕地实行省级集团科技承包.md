Next year, Heilongjiang Province plans to implement agricultural technology group contracting on approximately 10 million mu of farmland in the key grain-producing areas of the Songnen Plain and the Sanjiang Plain across 15 counties (cities). This is a new measure aimed at accelerating the promotion and application of comprehensive agricultural technologies to break through the stagnant situation in grain production in recent years.

The specific method for group contracting is as follows: the provincial government will take the lead, organizing over 200 experts, professors, and technical personnel from the Provincial Department of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Fisheries, the Northeast Agricultural University, and the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The administrative leadership, agricultural technology, and material departments at various levels will be organized to form a "three-in-one" contracting group consisting of political, technical, and material components. Comprehensive measures will be taken to contract the stable increase in production of major crops such as corn, rice, soybeans, and wheat in these counties. The contracting party and the contracting-out party will sign a contract, specifying the production targets to be achieved, as well as the verification and reward/punishment methods, ensuring clear responsibilities, rights, and benefits.

It is reported that this year, some counties (cities) in Heilongjiang Province have implemented technology group contracting, and the increase in production has been very significant.

A provincial government official responsible for agriculture said that while implementing provincial-level group contracting, local (city) and county-level group contracting activities should also be carried out. To prevent the dispersion of forces, group contracting will be integrated with the ongoing "Harvest Plan" and generally will not be started anew.

To ensure that group contracting achieves better results, the province plans to use the newly increased agricultural materials, loans, and financial support funds for the following year to support the implementation of group contracting.

This official, when explaining the importance of this activity, said that the province will regard this activity as a breakthrough measure in the initial stage of science and technology in agriculture next year, as a breakthrough point for accelerating the promotion and application of comprehensive agricultural technologies, to break through the current stagnant situation in grain production. It is understood that the group contracting plan has been preliminarily determined, and the province will form a leading group consisting of provincial government leaders and department heads to be responsible for the guidance and coordination of this activity.

　　明年科技兴农一项突破性措施
　　黑龙江对一千万亩耕地实行省级集团科技承包
    新华社哈尔滨11月21日电　（记者张广远）黑龙江省决定，明年在重点产粮区的松嫩平原和三江平原的15个县（市）、约1000万亩耕地上开展农业技术集团承包。这是旨在加快农业综合技术的推广应用，突破近年来粮食生产徘徊局面采取的一项新措施。
    集团承包的具体办法是，由省政府牵头，组织省农牧渔业厅、东北农学院、省农科院的200多名专家、教授和技术人员参加，把各级行政领导、农业技术和物资等部门的力量组织起来，形成政、技、物“三位一体”的承包集团，采取综合措施，对这些县的玉米、水稻、大豆、小麦几种主要作物的稳定增产进行承包。承包方与发包方签订承包合同，规定达到的产量指标及验收、奖惩办法，做到责、权、利分明。
    据介绍，今年，黑龙江省有一部分县（市）搞了技术集团承包，增产效果非常明显。
    省政府一位负责农业的同志说，在开展省级集团承包的同时，各地（市）、县也要开展集团承包活动。为了防止分散力量，把集团承包与目前开展的“丰收计划”结合起来进行，一般不另起炉灶。
    为了使集团承包收到更好的成效，省里准备把明年新增的农用物资、贷款和财政支农资金，用于支持开展集团承包。
    这位负责人在阐述这项活动的重要意义时说，省里将把这项活动看作明年科技兴农起步阶段的一项突破性措施，作为加速农业综合技术推广应用的一个突破口，以使粮产突破当前的徘徊局面。据了解，目前集团承包方案已初步确定，省里将组成由省政府领导和各部门负责人参加的领导小组，负责对此项活动的指导和协调工作。
