Two East German citizens, Kastens and Mansfeld, who recently returned from West Germany, spoke to the East German newspaper "Junge Welt" about their experiences.

According to the November 3rd report in "Junge Welt," they had traveled to West Germany via the Hungarian-Austrian border and then to Austria in mid-September.

They said that upon arrival in West Germany, they were initially well-received, but soon experienced neglect and unfair treatment. They had no place to live, no stable job, and no guarantee of a secure life. Employers treated them unfairly; while locals earned 17 West German Marks per hour for the same work, they were paid only 4 Marks. Rent was prohibitively expensive, with a room without hot water or heating costing 650 Marks per month.

Their shared experience was that West German society was chaotic, with no security for life or property. In comparison, they felt that socialist East Germany was more suitable for their work and life. When they learned that East Germany allowed citizens who had left to return, they decided to go back.

According to the report, among the East German citizens who had left for West Germany in recent months, some have already returned to East Germany.

    民德两公民谈在西德的遭遇
    没有自己住所  没有固定工作  生活没有保证
    新华社柏林十一月三日电　前不久从联邦德国返回的民主德国公民卡斯滕斯和曼斯菲尔德在接受民主德国《青年世界报》采访时，谈了他们在联邦德国的遭遇。
    据《世界青年报》三日报道，他们是今年九月中旬经匈奥边境绕道奥地利前往联邦德国的。
    据他们说，刚到联邦德国时受到很好的接待，但很快就受到冷落和不公平待遇。他们在那里没有自己的住所，没有固定的工作，生活没有保证。企业主对他们不公平，同样的工作当地人每个工时付十七西德马克，而对他们最多只付四西德马克。房租贵得无法承受，一间没有热水和取暖设备的房子每月收房租六百五十西德马克。
    他们的共同感受是，联邦德国社会秩序混乱，生命财产无保障。相比之下，还是社会主义的民主德国更适于他们的工作和生活。当他们得知民主德国允许出走的公民回去时，便决定重返故里。
    据报道，在近几个月出走联邦德国的民主德国国公民中，已有一部分人回到民主德国。
