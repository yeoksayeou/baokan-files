China has approximately 1.5 billion mu of arable land, with over 1 billion mu classified as medium- and low-yield fields, accounting for more than two-thirds of the current arable land. Among these, the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain has about 270 million mu of arable land, with over 210 million mu being medium- and low-yield fields. To ensure the sustained and stable growth of China's agriculture and achieve the strategic goal of producing 500 billion kilograms of grain and 400 kilograms of grain per capita by the end of the century, it is essential to rely on science and technology. We must strengthen the comprehensive treatment and transformation of large areas of medium- and low-yield fields, tapping into their potential. This is a measure of strategic significance for the further development of China's agricultural production.

The Huang-Huai-Hai Plain is China's largest plain and an important agricultural region, with favorable conditions for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry. It is one of China's major grain and cotton production areas.

As of 1987, its grain production accounted for 20.4% of the national total, wheat production accounted for 43.6% of the national total, corn and oilseeds accounted for 20%, tobacco leaves accounted for over 40%, and cotton lint accounted for 57% of the national total. The treatment and development of this region will accelerate the overall development of agriculture in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, playing a crucial role in the current and future national economic construction.

In 1988, the state designated the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain as a key area for agricultural development and treatment, setting new production capacity targets of 25 million tons of grain, 10 million tons of cotton, 10 million tons of oilseeds, and 20 million tons of meat. Broad masses of scientific and technological personnel responded positively to the call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, launching the Huang-Huai-Hai agricultural development campaign. It is expected that agricultural production in the Huang-Huai-Hai region will achieve even greater development.

　　重点治理的黄淮海农业区
    我国约15亿亩耕地，中低产田达10亿亩以上，超过现有耕地的2／3，其中黄淮海平原约2.7亿亩耕地，中低产田2.1亿亩以上。要保证我国农业持续稳定地增长，使本世纪末实现粮食总产5000亿公斤、人均粮食400公斤的战略目标，必须依靠科学技术，加强大面积中低产田的综合治理改造，挖掘中低产田潜力，这是我国农业生产进一步发展的一项具有战略意义的措施。
    黄淮海平原是我国最大的一个平原和重要的农业区，具有发展农牧业的有利条件，为我国的主要粮棉产地。
    以1987年计，它的粮食产量占全国总产的20.4％，小麦产量占全国总产的43.6％，玉米、油料占20％，烟叶占40％以上，皮棉则占全国总产的57％，它的治理和发展将带动整个黄淮海平原农业的加速发展，在当前的和今后的国民经济建设中占有十分重要的地位。
    1988年，国家将黄淮海平原定为农业开发重点治理区，制定了新增生产力的指标为粮食2500万吨，棉花100万吨，油料100万吨，肉类200万吨。广大科技人员积极响应党中央、国务院的号召，展开了黄淮海农业开发战役，预期黄淮海农业生产将会有更大的发展。
