	The Struggle for the Central Plains
	—The Second China Weiqi Masters Cup Tournament (Part Three)

	By reporters Wu Hui and Miu Lu

	Ma Xiaochun finally achieved his wish.

	Just after losing the title of Tian Yuan, Ma Xiaochun in the finals of the second China Weiqi Masters Cup Tournament won consecutive victories, securing the title of Master with an undefeated record from Liu Xiaoguang. Henan chess fans, who had long hoped for Liu Xiaoguang's successful defense, still greeted Ma Xiaochun, who won the 1989 Master title, with enthusiastic applause.

	The second China Weiqi Masters Cup Tournament, which lasted nearly a year, saw dozens of high-ranking Chinese chess players compete in Beijing, battle in Hainan, and decide the outcome in the Central Plains. After more than a hundred intense matches, this thrilling tournament finally concluded in Zhengzhou.

	If the final match was the climax of the entire tournament, then the third match between Liu and Ma was the climax within the climax.

	The usually cautious Ma Xiaochun still vividly remembers the scene from last year's Tian Yuan Tournament where he first won and then lost. Liu Xiaoguang had too much psychological pressure in the first two matches and performed poorly. In the decisive third match, Liu's tenacious and combative style was fully displayed. As Ma Xiaochun said, "This match was very tiring. Under Liu's tenacious fighting, my advantage gradually disappeared. If we continued, the outcome would have been uncertain."

	Winning the championship in a high-level Weiqi tournament is an honor, but for the players, they do not consider this as the most important thing. After the match, Ma Xiaochun said that he was most happy to have the opportunity to play against Japan's top-level players. Ma Xiaochun said, "Even if I cannot defeat Kobayashi Koichi, I still hope to win at least one game."

	For Liu Xiaoguang, who failed to defend his title, the favorable factors of playing at home undoubtedly became a psychological burden, affecting his performance. Failure for an athlete is not necessarily a bad thing; it allows the player to analyze themselves more calmly and think more seriously about the future. Who can say that Liu Xiaoguang, who won the Tian Yuan title, will not show his might again in future Masters Tournaments?

    ——琼联杯第二届中国围棋名人战纪实（三）

    马晓春终于如愿以偿。
    刚刚失去天元桂冠的马晓春在第二届中国围棋名人战决赛中连战连捷，以不败战绩从刘小光手中夺得名人称号。曾一直期待着刘小光卫冕成功的河南棋迷们仍以热烈的掌声向获得1989年度名人称号的马晓春表示祝贺。
    历时近一年的琼联杯第二届中国围棋名人战波澜起伏，我国高段位的几十名棋手初战北京，激战海南，决战中原，经历了百余盘激烈的争夺，终于使这届惊心动魄的名人战在郑州写下了这个完整的句号。
    如果说决赛是整个名人战的高潮的话，那么刘、马二人第三盘的交锋，则是高潮中的高潮。
    一向谨慎的马晓春对去年天元赛中先胜后负的情景记忆犹新：刘小光前两盘心理负担过重，发挥失准。在背水一战的第三盘，他那顽强善战的战斗作风得到了充分发挥。用马晓春的话说：“这一盘下得非常累，在小光顽强的拚杀下，我的优势一点点失去，如果有可能再下下去的话，结局很难说了。”
    获得全国高水平围棋大赛的桂冠是一种殊荣，然而对于棋手来说，他们却不以此为重。赛后，马晓春表示，他最高兴的是能够获得与日本超一流棋手手谈的机会。马晓春说：“即使我不能战胜小林光一，我也希望能拿下一盘棋。”
    对于未能卫冕成功的刘小光来说，在家乡比赛的有利因素无疑成为他的一种心理负担，影响了棋艺发挥。失败对于运动员来说，并非是一件坏事，它将使棋手能够更冷静地分析自己，更严肃地思考未来。谁能说获得天元称号的刘小光不会在今后的名人战中再显神威呢？
