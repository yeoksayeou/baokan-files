Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 11th.

Sri Lanka has once again donated a batch of corneas to China. This is the fifth time the Chinese people have received such a precious gift from the Sri Lankan International Eye Bank.

Last September, when Sri Lankan Prime Minister Premadasa visited China, he handed over five corneas from Sri Lankan donors to Chinese Premier Li Peng, who then passed them on to the Chinese people. Premadasa also decided that Sri Lanka would regularly donate corneas to China in the future. Beijing Union Medical College Hospital, at the request of Li Peng and the Ministry of Health, successfully performed corneal transplants on Chinese patients using these corneas.

At the donation ceremony held today at Beijing Union Medical College Hospital, Vice President of the hospital, Lu Zhaolin, reported that since Premadasa's visit to China, the Sri Lankan International Eye Bank has donated 28 corneas to the Chinese people in four separate donations. The hospital used these corneas to perform 22 corneal transplants, achieving an 85% success rate. As a result, 20 Chinese blind individuals have regained their sight.

    斯里兰卡再次向我捐赠供体眼球
    据新华社北京11月11日电　（记者赵卫）斯里兰卡政府和人民今天又捐赠给我国一批供体眼球。这已是中国人民第5次从斯里兰卡国际眼库收到这样的珍贵馈赠。
    去年9月，斯里兰卡总理普雷马达萨总理访问我国时，把5个斯里兰卡人的供体眼球通过李鹏总理转送给中国人民，并决定以后将定期向中国捐赠供体眼球。北京协和医院受李鹏总理和卫生部的委托用这些眼球为中国患者成功地进行了角膜移植手术。
    今天在北京协和医院举行的捐赠仪式上，北京协和医院的副院长陆召麟介绍说，自从普雷马达萨总理访问我国后，斯里兰卡国际眼库已先后4次向中国人民捐赠了28个供体眼球。协和医院利用这些眼球进行了22次角膜移植手术，成功率达到85％。20名中国盲人因此见到光明。
