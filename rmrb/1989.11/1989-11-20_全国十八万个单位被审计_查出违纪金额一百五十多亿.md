	Nationwide Audit of 180,000 Units Reveals Over 15 Billion Yuan in Violations

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 19 — Information from the National Audit Office indicates that from January to October this year, 180,000 units nationwide were audited, revealing 15.1 billion yuan in violations. Of this amount, 3.7 billion yuan should be remitted to the treasury, with 2 billion yuan already remitted.

	One of the key tasks of this year's audit work was to follow up on the auditing of fixed asset investment projects that have been halted or slowed down. Over 10,000 such projects nationwide have been audited. To assist in the rectification and reorganization of companies, the National Audit Office audited the "Kanghua" and four other major companies. Provincial-level audit bureaus audited 218 companies, and 155 more are currently being audited.

	Over 17,000 contract-operated enterprises nationwide have been audited, revealing that some enterprises have falsely reported profits and losses and have inaccurate asset records. In one province, 419 contract-operated units were audited, and it was found that 142 units falsely reported and had inaccurate amounts totaling over 40 million yuan. After the audit, these issues have been addressed, and suggestions have been made to improve management and perfect the contract-operated responsibility system. Many regions have also conducted audits into the rapid growth of consumption funds.

	According to statistics from 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, audit agencies have audited 750 county-level and above financial and tax departments this year. Issues such as unauthorized tax reductions and exemptions that violate financial discipline were found, resulting in an additional 480 million yuan for the treasury and strengthening financial and tax management. Local audit agencies have also conducted audits on poverty alleviation and agricultural support funds, and funds that were misappropriated have been returned to their original channels.
