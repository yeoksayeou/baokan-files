How to Quickly Change the Backward Situation

Currently, while road transportation is operated by multiple entities, it is still managed by multiple entities. This leads to fragmented policies, unclear responsibilities, and overlapping functions, which contradicts the principle of integrated management of urban and rural roads. Especially in the past two years, the development and management of road passenger transportation in our province have often been disrupted, leaving passenger transport operators at a loss and complaining bitterly.

Due to multiple operators and managers, there is a rush to set up departure, parking, and ticketing stations. At the same time, the practice of using roads as stations and random parking is very common. Because multiple entities are vying for route approvals, some routes have too many vehicles while others have too few, leading to operators competing for routes and passengers, fighting over main routes and abandoning branch routes.

Passenger transport operators are at a loss and complain endlessly. Because of multiple management entities, each has its own policies, and when issues arise, they push the blame onto each other. For the operators, the procedures are cumbersome, and they don't know where to turn. Drivers say: Nowadays, it's really hard to drive and park; every time we go out, we have to prepare at least tens to hundreds of yuan in cash for fines.

Originally, the feature of road passenger transportation is flexibility, mobility, and convenience, allowing passengers to be picked up at their doorstep and dropped off at their destination. However, because of multiple management entities, although there are more buses now, a new "difficulty in taking a bus" has emerged. Some regulations prohibit out-of-town vehicles from entering the city, while others prohibit city vehicles from going outside the city, artificially creating "difficulty in taking a bus."

In the process of rectification and reform, it is hoped that all levels of government will treat urban and rural road management as an organic whole, and reform according to the principle of multiple operators but single management, striving to achieve a management system of one city, one transportation bureau.

### 城乡道路应实行一体化管理

　　城乡道路应实行一体化管理
　　湖北　云罡
    当前公路运输在多家经营的同时，仍是多家管理，这就导致了政出多门、职责不清、职能交叉，违背了城乡道路运输管理一体化的原则。特别是近两年来，我省道路客运事业的发展和管理经常受到干扰，使客运经营者无所适从，叫苦不迭。
    由于多家经营，多家管理，于是争相设置发车、停车、售票站点。同时，以路代站、乱停乱靠现象也非常普遍；由于多家争着审批线路，造成有的线路车多，有的线路车少，于是，经营者相互间争线抢客，争干线弃支线。
    客运经营者无所适从，叫苦连天。因为是多家管理，各有各的政策，遇事又互相推诿，对经营者来说手续繁杂，无所适从。司机们说：现在是行车、停车真难，每出一趟车至少得准备几十元到上百元的罚款现金。
    本来道路客运的特点是灵活、机动、方便，可以接客上门，送客到家，但由于是多家管理，现在虽然客车多了，新的“乘车难”也随之出现。有的规定外地车辆不得进入市内，有的规定市内车辆不得跑到市外，人为地造成“乘车难”。
    在治理整顿中，希望各级政府能把城乡道路管理作为一个有机整体，按照多家经营、一家管理的原则进行改革，努力实现一城一交的管理体制。
