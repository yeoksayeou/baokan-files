    Cotton procurement in the Xingtai region of Hebei Province has accelerated, with the supply and marketing cooperatives improving their services. By the tenth of October, the amount of raw cotton procured had reached 20.8 percent of the annual plan.

    The Xingtai region, comprising sixteen counties and cities, is one of China's key cotton-producing areas. The staff of the regional supply and marketing cooperatives have adopted a method of focusing on key cotton-producing townships, villages, and households, and have signed purchase and sale contracts with cotton farmers. The contracts stipulate that the supply and marketing cooperatives will ensure the supply of seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, and will return cottonseed oil, cake, and fertilizers to the cotton farmers when purchasing cotton. During the cotton growing season, the cooperatives provide production materials to some cotton-growing specialists on a deferred payment basis and help cotton farmers apply nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers in the correct proportions. Each cotton station of the supply and marketing cooperatives has clearly stated that this year they will not accept "favor cotton" and will restore the "one test, five determinations" method, which involves testing each batch of seed cotton with a cotton gin to determine its moisture content, impurities, soil impurities, cotton fiber length, and grade.

    邢台地区棉花收购加快
    本报讯　记者赵兴林报道：河北省邢台地区供销社改进服务加快收购棉花，到十月上旬，已收购皮棉数量占年度计划的百分之二十点八。
    邢台地区所属十六个县、市，是我国重点产棉区之一。地区供销社职工，采取包重点产棉乡、村、户的办法，并同棉农签订了购销合同。合同规定：供销社要做好种籽、化肥和农药供应，售棉时如数返还给棉农的棉籽油、饼和化肥等。在棉花生长期，供销社对一些种棉专业大户，先供应生产资料、缓期收款，并帮助棉农按比例施用含氮、磷、钾成分的化肥。各供销社棉站明确提出今年不收“人情棉”，恢复“一试五定”，即：对每份籽棉都要先经轧花机检验棉绒，再确定其所含水分、杂质、土杂、棉绒长度和等级。
