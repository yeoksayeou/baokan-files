South Korean Court Continues Trial of Lim Su-kyung

According to a report from the Seoul Broadcasting System, the Seoul Criminal District Court held its second public trial of Lim Su-kyung, a female university student who visited North Korea, on November 27 under tight security.

Lim Su-kyung continued to defend her actions in visiting the North during the trial. She emphasized that her decision to go to Pyongyang to participate in the 13th World Youth Festival was not made according to instructions from the North. Lim Su-kyung stated that if the court continued to suspect her visit to the North was aimed at promoting South-North unification, she would refuse to answer the judge's questions.

The South Korean police deployed over 3,000 officers to guard the court, anticipating protests from Lim Su-kyung's supporters. The judicial authorities also restricted the number of spectators allowed in the courtroom.

　　南朝鲜法院继续审判林秀卿
    据汉城广播电台报道，南朝鲜汉城刑事地方法院二十七日在戒备森严的气氛中对访问朝鲜北方的女大学生林秀卿进行第二次公开审判。
    林秀卿在审判中继续为她访问北方的行动辩护。她强调她自己到平壤参加第十三届世界青年联欢节并不是按照北方的指令作出的决定。林秀卿表示，如果法院继续怀疑她访问北方旨在促进南北统一的初衷，她将拒绝回答法官的提问。
    南朝鲜警方出动了三千多名警察守护法院，防备林秀卿的支持者举行抗议活动。司法当局还限制旁听者人数。
