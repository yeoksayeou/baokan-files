This floor, this window, form a mystery, an allure.

The day we moved into the building, we suddenly heard a song: "I come from the mountains, bringing orchids and grass..." "Listen!" I tugged at Da Ma's sleeve. It wasn't that I was easily surprised, but it was said that this building was known as the common people's building, where everyone was busy with daily chores. Who could have the leisure to sing?

Da Ma was also surprised. We both looked towards the window covered in grease, unable to see the person inside singing.

The next day, passing by the staircase again, we heard that same voice. Day after day, the song remained the same.

Listening to the song while everyone else was busy cooking lunch, it was like holding a bouquet of fragrant lilies. When stepping into the evening sun on the way home, it was like being in a garden of intoxicating jasmine, instantly refreshing the spirit...

With that heartfelt and immersive singing, my imagination grew richer each time. Sometimes, I could vividly see: the distant mountains shrouded in mist, the hazy moonlight on the river, the gurgling mountain spring, the birdsong in the birch forest... "She must be singing with a smile, her voice is so sweet!" I praised.

Da Ma said, "Her singing isn't that good!" I retorted, "Of course not, if she were a professional singer, she wouldn't live here! How well she sings isn't important, the key is that she loves to sing!"

Day after day, her voice echoed in my heart like waves.

Why does she love to sing? She must be someone who loves life, taking everything in stride. If it weren't for that, it must be that she has a satisfying job, a loving family, everything just right.

The more I thought about it, the more enchanting her voice became, the more mysterious the small window, the more enigmatic the woman herself. I truly hoped that one day, the window would open, the door would crack, and I could see the singer's appearance. To not miss such an opportunity, I started running up and down the stairs more often, sometimes buying soy sauce, sometimes taking out the trash. Running up and down, my legs ached, but I didn't feel it, listening to the song made me forget everything else. One morning, the waves in my heart suddenly revealed a patch of blue sky. Why not change my perspective and guess? Who can rule out that the singer might have some flaws? She might be a paralyzed patient, only able to dispel her loneliness with endless songs. Or she might be blind, only able to vent her solitude with non-stop songs...

I suddenly felt that it was too much to want to solve this mystery, better to leave one side mysterious and one side imaginative in my heart, letting the song water and nourish it, growing a beautiful world in the listener's feelings.

Before I knew it, I also started humming. First, I hummed softly, then sang lowly along with the tape recorder's music. Although I still didn't have the courage to sing loudly, the song had become a part of my life. On a rainy day, my heart felt heavy, like it was pressed down with clouds. Coming home from work, dragging mud and water, what greeted me was still pots and pans. Why was today so off? Da Ma might be pondering my thoughts, slowly saying, "The song from the second floor is gone." Indeed, was that the reason for my restlessness? I couldn't help but feel a shock in my heart. The song suddenly disappeared, the rhythm of life was gone. Was the singer not home? Or was she in a bad mood? I really wanted to find an excuse to knock on the second floor's door. Until the third day, the song resounded again, and my hanging heart became joyful once more. Spring came, summer came, every household opened their windows and doors. The song from the second floor grew wings, flying with the air's movement, striking one window after another, from one building to another. I no longer wanted to meet the singer, even feared seeing her, because I loved her song too much. That obsession with the song, grown from guessing and imagining, was indeed a green, resonant wind in my life.

A friend came from afar, moved by the song from the second floor. Asking: Who is the singer? I thought for a moment, softly singing, "In the sky, there is a sun, in the water, there is a moon, I don't know, I don't know—" The visitor laughed, happily joining in, "Which is rounder, which is brighter?"

    哪个更圆　哪个更亮

    这层楼，这个窗，构成一个神秘，一个诱惑。
    搬进楼的那天，忽闻一阵歌声：“我从山中来，带着兰花草……”“哟，听呀！”我拉拉大马衣角。不是我少见多怪，据说这栋楼号称平民楼，人们整天为柴米油盐奔波，是谁竟有唱歌的雅兴呢？
    大马也惊讶了。我们四只眼睛一齐望那方挂满油烟的纱窗，看不清里面唱歌的人。
    下一天，又过楼梯口，又听到那样的女中音。一日又一日，歌声依旧。
    在家家忙着午炊时听那歌，仿佛捧着一束溢着浓馨的郁金香，当踏着夕阳晚归时听那歌，仿佛置身于醉人的丁香园顿觉神清气爽……
    凭着那入情入境的歌声，我的想象一次一次地丰富起来，有时竟能那么真切地看到：如黛笼纱的远山，江面上朦胧的月色，淙淙流淌的山泉，白桦林中的鸟语……“她一定是笑着唱的，那歌声多甜！”我赞美说。
    大马说：“她的歌唱得并不太好！”我反驳：“当然喽，她若是歌唱家就不会住到这来！她唱得怎样无关紧要，关键是她爱唱歌！”
    日复一日，她的歌声在我心中荡成一片波涛。
    她为什么爱唱歌？她一定是热爱生活的人，对一切困难都处之泰然。若不是这样，那就是她有一份称心的工作，有一个爱她的家庭，一切称心如意。
    越想得多，那歌声越有魅力，那小窗越神秘，那女主人越是个谜。真希望有一天，那纱窗打开，扇门开一道缝，让我能睹歌者风采。为了不错过这样的机遇，我楼上楼下跑得勤了，有时买酱油，有时倒灰桶。跑上跑下腿疼也不感觉，听那歌就忘了别的。一天早晨，我心中的波涛忽然露出一块蓝天。我为什么不调个角度去推测呢？谁能排除歌者不会有什么缺陷呢？她说不定是个瘫痪病人，只能用没完没了的歌声排遣寂寞。也说不定是个盲人，只能用无休止的歌声宣泄孤独……我忽然觉得一定要揭开这个谜，未免过份，不如留一方神秘一方想象在心间，让那歌声每日浇灌它滋润它，在听者的感觉世界里生长出一片美好境地。
    不知不觉中我也变得哼哼呀呀了，先是压着嗓子哼，之后在录音机的旋律里低唱。虽然至今仍没勇气亮开嗓子放声高歌，可歌声已成为我生活的组成部分了。一个雨天，心也像压了云絮，沉甸甸的。下班拖泥带水回到家，迎候我的又是锅碗瓢盆。雨天不止这一个，今天为什么这么不对劲？大马也许在琢磨我的心事，慢吞吞地说：“二楼的歌声怎么没了？”是啊，那是不是我此时烦燥的根源呢？不禁心头一震。歌声突然消失，生活的韵味一下没了。那歌者不在家么？还是她心情不快呢？我真想找个什么借口，去推二楼那扇门。直到第三天，歌声重又响起，我悬着的心才又欢乐起来。春来了，夏来了，家家户户开窗敞门了。二楼的歌声插上无形的翅膀，随着空气的波动，拍击着一扇扇窗，从一幢楼飞进另一幢楼。我不想认识甚至怕见歌者了，因为我太喜欢她的歌了。那种在猜测、想象中生长起来的对歌的痴迷，实在是我生命里一片绿色的作响的风。
    有朋自远方来，为二楼歌声所动。因问：歌者何人？我若有所思，轻唱：“天上有个太阳，水中有个月亮，我不知道，我不知道——”来者笑了，乐而和之：“哪个更圆，哪个更亮？”
