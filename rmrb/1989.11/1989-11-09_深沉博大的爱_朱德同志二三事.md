“Is it beautiful or not, the water of one's hometown; is it close or not, the people of one's hometown.” This is a proverb that has been passed down among the people of Sichuan.

Comrade Zhu De is also a native of Sichuan. He harbored an extremely deep affection for his hometown and his relatives. However, he also had a unique characteristic: he never allowed personal feelings to replace party principles, and he never used his authority to seek personal gains for his relatives and friends. He had repeatedly and earnestly told his son Zhu Qi and daughter Zhu Min, “You are not only my children, but also the children of the working people. Therefore, you must not have any special privileges just because of your relationship with me.”

Throughout his life, Comrade Zhu De had many stories related to this aspect. Here are just a few:

In April 1947, Comrade Zhu De came to the Jinzhong Military Region to inspect work. After listening to the report from the commander of the 11th Sub-district, Du Wenda, he specially asked, “How has Zhu Qi been doing recently? You must tell me the truth.”

Du Wenda said, “Comrade Zhu Qi is active in his work, studies hard, and has a strong sense of responsibility. For example, he recently did an excellent job in communication and liaison work when I led a few regiments to attack Zhao County.”

Comrade Zhu De quickly interrupted, “You shouldn’t just talk about his strengths. Doesn’t he have any weaknesses?”

Du Wenda thought for a moment and said, “Of course, he has weaknesses. He is a bit careless in his personal life and speaks casually sometimes.”

Comrade Zhu De pondered for a while and then seriously said to Du Wenda, “Zhu Qi is careless in his personal life, lazy, and speaks casually. This is because he thinks he is the son of Zhu De and has a sense of superiority. If this continues, it will have a very bad influence and he will become detached from the masses. Therefore, I require you to discipline him strictly, not to treat him specially, and to eliminate his sense of superiority. You should go back and talk to him, telling him that this is a task given to you by Zhu De. He must overcome his own shortcomings, strengthen his sense of organizational discipline, respect his superiors, care for his subordinates, treat others equally, and especially respect the people. He must pay attention to the context and impact of his words, and not say anything that harms unity. He is a Communist Party member, serving the people, a servant of the people, not an official or a lord, and he must not have the old military habits of showing off or acting like a big shot.”

Comrade Zhu De loved his relatives who were with him, as well as those far away in his hometown. However, his love was based on the interests of the nation and the party’s policies, a higher level of love.

After the founding of New China in 1949, Zhu De became one of the main leaders of the party, the state, and the military. At this time, his relatives back in his hometown prepared to come to Beijing, ostensibly to “visit,” but in reality, they wanted to use their relationship with Comrade Zhu De to seek a more ideal position. The Yilong County Committee, considering that these relatives had suffered greatly under the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries and local tyrants before liberation, and that many had been forced to flee their homes and only returned to Yilong after liberation, agreed to their request and sent them to Chongqing, asking the Southwest Bureau of the Communist Party to transfer them to Beijing. The Southwest Bureau immediately telegraphed the Central Committee for instructions, and Comrade Zhu De immediately replied, “...Please persuade them to return immediately. Those who wish to work should be employed according to the party’s policy and their abilities.” Later, Comrade Zhu De also wrote a letter to his relatives, saying that the country had just been established and there was much to do, everyone was busy, and he urged them to work hard, not to seek special treatment, not to trouble the local party committee, and to contribute to the prosperity and strength of the motherland.

In 1959, in preparation for the visit of international friends to Zhu De’s hometown, Ma’anchang, the Yilong County Committee, according to higher-level instructions, repaired the dilapidated ancestral home and turned it into an exhibition hall. In 1960, Comrade Zhu De took the opportunity of his inspection tour of Sichuan to return to Yilong, which he had not seen for 52 years, to visit the people and relatives of his hometown. After seeing the ancestral home, he told the county committee secretary, “Don’t build an exhibition hall for me. Turn this place into a school for the children to study. What do you think? Change it quickly!” In 1962, when the county committee secretary Kang Zhisheng and deputy secretary Fei Dezheng came to Beijing for a meeting, Comrade Zhu De again asked them about this matter. Kang Zhisheng repeatedly explained the reason for preserving the exhibition hall. Before leaving, Zhu De said, “I thank the Yilong County Committee, all levels of party organizations, and the people for their trust in me. But on this matter, I still reserve my opinion.”

### 深沉博大的爱——朱德同志二三事

    深沉博大的爱
    ——朱德同志二三事
    刘启光
    “美不美，家乡水；亲不亲，故乡人。”这是流传在四川人民中间的一句谚语。
    朱德同志也是四川人。他对自己的家乡、自己的亲人，是怀有无比深厚的感情的。但是他也有和别人不尽相同的地方，那就是决不用私情去代替党的原则，决不用职权去为亲友谋取私利。他曾多次语重心长地对儿子朱琦、女儿朱敏说过：“你们不止是我的孩子，也是劳动人民的孩子。因此你们决不可以因为有我的关系而有任何特殊。”
    朱德同志一生，有关这方面的故事是很多的。这里只略述几件：
    1947年4月，朱德同志来到冀中军区检查工作。在听完了第十一分区司令员杜文达的汇报后，又特意问道：“朱琦在你们那里，他最近的表现怎么样？你要如实地讲。”
    杜文达说：“朱琦同志的工作积极，学习也好，责任心也很强。比如最近我带几个团去攻打赵县，朱琦同志负责的通讯联络工作就做得很出色。”
    朱德同志连忙制止说：“你不要光讲优点，难道他就没有缺点吗？”
    杜文达想了想，说：“缺点嘛，当然有。他有时生活上散漫一些，说话随便些。”
    朱德同志沉思了一会儿，而后严肃地对杜文达说：“朱琦生活上散漫，吊儿浪当，说话随便，这就是他认为自己是我朱德的儿子，有优越感嘛。这样发展下去，就会造成很不好的影响，是会脱离群众的。因此，我要求你对他要严格管教，不能搞特殊，要把他的优越感克服掉。你回去要找他谈谈，告诉他这是我朱德交代给你的任务。要他今后一定要克服掉自己身上的毛病，加强组织纪律观念，尊重领导，爱护下级，平等待人，特别要注意尊重人民群众，说话要注意场合，注意影响，不利于团结的话不许说。他是个共产党员，是为人民服务的，是人民的勤务员，而不是当官做老爷，更不准有耍威风、摆官架子等旧军队的作风。”
    朱德同志热爱身边的亲人，也热爱远在故乡的亲人。但是他这种爱是建立在国家民族的利益和党的政策的基础上，是更高层次的爱。
    1949年新中国成立后，朱德成了党、国家和军队的主要领导人之一。这时候，远在家乡的亲属们又准备来北京，名为“看望”，实际还是想利用同朱德同志的亲属关系，谋求一个更理想的职位。仪陇县委考虑到这些亲属解放前受够了国民党反动派和土豪劣绅们的迫害，不少人还因受牵连而流落他乡，解放后才返回仪陇，遂同意了他们的要求，把他们送到重庆，请中共西南局转送北京。西南局急电请示中央，朱德同志立即回电称：“……请动员他们立即回去。要求参加工作的，也要根据党的政策，量才录用。”随后，朱德同志又专为此事给亲属们写信，说国家刚刚建立，百废待兴，人人都忙，嘱咐他们要安心工作，不搞特殊，不要给地方党委增加麻烦，要多为祖国的繁荣昌盛出力。
    1959年，为了迎接国际友人来朱德同志的故里马鞍场参观，仪陇县委根据上级的指示，将破旧的故居加以修整，改为陈列室。1960年，朱德同志利用来四川视察工作的机会，回到阔别了52年的仪陇，看望故乡的人民和亲属。当他看完故居后，对县委书记说：“不要办我的展览馆，把这个地方办成一所学校，让娃娃们念书，好不好？很快就改！”1962年，仪陇县委书记康智盛和副书记费德政来北京开会，朱德同志又向他们问及此事，康智盛再三解释了把陈列室保存下来的原因。临别时，朱德说：“我感谢仪陇县委、各级党组织和全体人民对我的信任。但对这件事，我仍然保留我的意见。”
