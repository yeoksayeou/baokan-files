In the tenth village group of Gaokeng Village, Chengguan Town, Wangcheng County, Hunan Province, there is a farmer who subscribes to six newspapers and magazines, including the People's Daily and Hunan Daily, at his own expense. His name is Guo RenGui, and he is an individual entrepreneur engaged in passenger transportation. When it comes to reading newspapers, he has a lot to say: "Thanks to the Party's policies, and with the newspapers as our advisors, we have gradually become prosperous. Newspapers are my best teachers and economic consultants. I spend hundreds of yuan each year to subscribe to newspapers, and it is truly worth it and I am willing to do so." These are his heartfelt words.

Since April this year, the turmoil in Beijing has spread across the country. Through studying the April 26th editorial in the People's Daily, he realized that this turmoil was very abnormal. He repeatedly educated his nephew, who was studying at a continuing education school, and other students to support the Party's leadership, not to take advantage of the country's difficulties to oppose the government, and not to participate in demonstrations. As a result, his nephew followed his uncle's advice, continued his normal studies, and did not participate in demonstrations or other activities. Later, his nephew saw his uncle and praised him for his foresight. He smiled and replied, "This is the foresight of the Party's newspaper."

Recently, the state has decided to rectify and improve the economy. Some individual entrepreneurs he is familiar with are anxious, believing that policies will change, and some are even preparing to sell their cars and stop operating. He repeatedly studied the speech given by Comrade Jiang Zemin at the 40th anniversary celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which was published in the newspapers, and found the policy basis for his work. He told these people: The state will protect those who have become wealthy through honest labor and legal operations. The policy of developing a multi-sector economy with public ownership as the mainstay will continue to be implemented. The rectification of taxation is to clean up illegal tax evaders. As long as we abide by the law and regulations, there is no need to be worried. This dispelled their doubts.

Guo RenGui initiated the establishment of the Wangcheng County Passenger Service Fleet and was elected as the political instructor. He organized 53 individual passenger transport vehicles on the route from the county seat to Changsha, regularly organized them to study current affairs and policies, and formulated measures for quality service. They posted regulations on free rides for disabled veterans, five-guarantee households, and the blind on the doors of each vehicle. Before and after National Day, some individual vehicle owners wanted to take advantage of the high passenger flow to raise fares. He intervened and stopped this. On October 2nd alone, he corrected 4 violations.

Guo RenGui loves to read newspapers and also loves to clip articles. No matter how late he returns home, if he does not browse through the newspapers delivered that day, he cannot sleep. For important articles and economic information, he clips them out and organizes them by category for future study. He has tasted the sweetness of reading newspapers.

　　“读报迷”虢仁贵
　　罗高飞
    在湖南省望城县城关镇高圹村第十村民小组，有一位自费订阅《人民日报》、《湖南日报》等6种报刊的农民。他叫虢仁贵，是个从事客运的个体户。提起读报，他颇有些津津乐道：“靠党的政策好，靠报纸当参谋，我们才逐步走上富裕的道路，报纸是我最好的老师和经济顾问，我每年花几百元订报纸，确实值得，也心甘情愿。”他这是心里话。
    今年4月份以来，北京的动乱波及全国。他通过《人民日报》4．26社论的学习，认识到这场动乱很不正常，多次教育他在进修学校念书的侄儿和其他同学，要拥护党的领导，不要利用国家的困难来反对政府，不要参加游行。结果，侄儿听了叔叔的话，坚持正常的学习，没有参加游行等活动。侄儿后来见到叔叔，夸他有远见，他笑着回答：“这是党报的远见。”
    最近一个时期，国家决定对经济进行治理整顿，一些和他熟悉的客运个体户惶惶不安，认为政策要变，还有的准备把车卖掉不开了。他反复研究报上刊登的江泽民同志在国庆40周年大会上的讲话，找到了做工作的政策依据。他对这些人说：国家对一部分通过诚实劳动和合法经营先富裕起来的人，是会给予保护的。发展以公有制为主体的多种成份的经济政策，国家将要继续执行。整顿税收，是清理违法偷税户，只要我们遵纪守法，就没必要担惊受怕。这样就打消了他们的疑虑。
    虢仁贵出面成立了望城县客运服务车队，并被选为政治指导员。他把县城至长沙线路的53辆个体客运车户组织起来，定期组织他们学习时事政策，制定了优质服务措施。他们把对残废军人、五保户、盲人等实行免费乘车的规定张贴在每辆车的车门上。国庆前后，有的个体车户想趁客流量大，抬高票价，他又出面制止。仅10月2日，他就纠正了4起违章事件。
    虢仁贵爱看报，也爱剪报。每天回来，哪怕再晚，如果不浏览一下当天送来的报纸，他是睡不着觉的。对重要文章和经济信息，他还剪下来，分门别类进行整理，以便日后学习。他尝到了读报的甜头。
