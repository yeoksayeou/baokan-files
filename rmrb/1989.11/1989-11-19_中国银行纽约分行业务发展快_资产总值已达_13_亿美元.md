Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 17th.

The Bank of China's New York branch has seen rapid business development and significant achievements since its establishment eight years ago. By mid-November this year, its total assets had reached $1.3 billion, a 25% increase from last year, and profits had grown by 100%.

This was announced by Wang Leibing, the general manager of the Bank of China's U.S. region, at an evening celebration held tonight to mark the eighth anniversary of the New York branch. Wang Leibing said, "These facts once again demonstrate to those who are concerned that the disturbances in Beijing this past spring and summer will not affect China's reform prospects: China's reforms will not stop, and the door to opening up to the outside world remains wide open."

The Bank of China's New York branch, which opened in New York in 1981, was initially very small, with only 30 employees. It has since grown into three branches: the New York branch, the New York Chinatown branch, and the Los Angeles branch, with a total of over 180 employees.

In recent years, these three branches have implemented measures such as strengthening management, improving services, and coordinating relationships, leading to steady business development.

Currently, the business scope of these three branches mainly includes deposits, loans, remittances, and import and export trade.

    中国银行纽约分行业务发展快
    资产总值已达13亿美元
    新华社纽约11月17日电 （记者钱文荣）中国银行纽约分行成立8年来，业务发展迅速，成绩显著。截至今年11月中旬，资产总值已达13亿美元，比去年增长25％，利润增长100％。
    这是中国银行美国地区总经理王雷冰在今晚举行的庆祝纽约分行成立8周年晚会上宣布的。王雷冰说，这些事实向那些担心今年春夏在北京发生的动乱会影响中国改革前景的朋友们再次表明：“中国的改革不会停止，对外开放的大门继续敞开着。”
    中国银行纽约分行于1981年在纽约初次开业时规模甚小，职工只有30人，现已发展为三个分行，即纽约分行、纽约华埠分行和洛杉矶分行，职工总人数达180多人。
    近几年来，这三个分行通过加强管理，改善服务，协调关系等措施，使银行业务得到稳步发展。
    目前，这三个分行的业务范围主要是存、放款，汇款和进出口贸易。
