Comrades, today I have the opportunity to meet with you all and share some of my experiences, and I am very happy about this.

To strive for the revival of China through diligent study is the purpose of our entrance into university. Fudan is a prestigious university with excellent faculty and research facilities. Having entered these gates, we should feel a sense of honor and also a sense of responsibility. From this recent turmoil, we can see that it has brought serious losses to the country's economic construction and to your studies. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee correctly explained the causes and nature of this turmoil. On the eve of National Day, Comrade Jiang Zemin, General Secretary, delivered an important speech, outlining the guidelines for China's future construction and development. In the coming period, we should combine this with our school's actual situation and seriously study this speech.

I was born in the Qing Dynasty and grew up in the old society. There are differences between us, and this is natural. From this student movement, I can see that young people do not understand the old China, do not understand the national conditions, and blindly yearn for Western democracy. Some even think that everything foreign is good. Therefore, I feel it is necessary to talk about my personal experiences and insights, hoping that you will be better able to study and live your lives in the future.

I have experienced China's yesterday. The old China was divided and slaughtered by imperialist powers, and I have deep feelings about this. In 1919, when I passed through Shanghai, which was then a microcosm of semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, I saw with my own eyes the sign "No Dogs and Chinese Allowed" hanging on the park by the Garden Bridge; warships of imperialist powers were moored on the Huangpu River, their cannons pointed at China; every winter, there were people freezing to death on Nanjing Road. At that time, Chinese people were considered an inferior race, the "Sick Men of East Asia." Now? We have become world champions; Huangpu Park has become a park for the people; the Huangpu River is moored with our own-built ten-thousand-ton ships; Nanjing Road is bustling with prosperity. Through these contrasts, one can see the problem clearly: without the Communist Party, there would be no new China. The Communist Party not only led us to overthrow the "Three Mountains" and establish the People's Republic, but more importantly, after liberation, it united China, which was a loose collection of sand. Without the Party's leadership, even the unity among intellectuals would be impossible.

From the age of 17, when I went to study in Japan, until 1949 when the country was liberated, in these 30 years, I went through three major crises.

In 1931, I obtained a Ph.D. in science from the Imperial University of Manchuria. I was the second Chinese to receive this degree, and at that time, both big and small newspapers in Japan reported this news. Later, when I worked as a lecturer at the university, Japanese newspapers reported: "A non-subject of the Empire became a lecturer at the Imperial University." Why? Because they looked down on Chinese people. My advisor was very good and helped me become a lecturer. After obtaining my Ph.D., my teachers and classmates all advised me not to return to China, to become a vice-professor at Taiwan University. I thought about it and decided to return to China. At that time, the monthly salary of a professor at a national university was 300 silver dollars, but the salary would only be paid after four months, and there was not even pocket money. At that time, I really wanted to go back. My alma mater in Japan reserved my position for me, and my wife and two children were still in Japan. When the president of Zhejiang University, Mr. Shao Feizi, learned of this, he rushed from Nanjing to my place overnight and knocked on my door early in the morning, saying, "You must not leave, you are our school's treasure!" "A scholar serves his benefactor with his life," that's what I thought at the time, so I stayed. President Shao did everything he could to give me 1,200 yuan as travel expenses. In the summer of 1931, I finally brought my wife and children back to China. That spring festival, my family was so poor that we could not celebrate the New Year. President Shao pawned his fur coat and gave me 26 yuan, which was the first crisis.

The second crisis was during the War of Resistance. The Imperial University of Manchuria sent a telegram in the name of my original advisor, asking me to return to my alma mater. At the same time, my father-in-law passed away, and my mother-in-law's family also sent a telegram urging me to return. My wife was very good and firmly refused to go. As a result, I did not go to Japan but followed Zhejiang University to relocate to Guizhou. We lived in a dilapidated temple, extremely poor, for about half a year, living on salted sweet potatoes. Despite this, I still trained four graduate students. There is a way out of every difficulty for those who do not bow their heads in the face of adversity. Thus, I managed to get through the second crisis.

The third crisis was before liberation, in 1948. I was a member of the National Academy of Sciences of the Kuomintang. At that time, I was in Hangzhou, and to make a living, I went to the Aviation School to teach trigonometry, plus the income from being a professor, to exchange for a few baskets of rice to fill the stomachs of my family of eight. In April 1949, the Kuomintang government wanted to take me and my family to Taiwan and had prepared airplane tickets. I felt that the atmosphere was wrong and firmly refused to go. Among my students, Comrade Gu Chaohao was an underground party member who organized students to elect me as the dean. Without these students, I would not have known what the Communist Party was. On the day Hangzhou was liberated, Comrade Gu Chaohao came and congratulated me, saying, "Liberation! Life will get better." With the help of these students, I got through the third crisis.

After liberation, I decided to work hard on teaching and research. In 1958, I applied to join the Party, and in 1959, I became a member. From then on, I devoted my whole heart and soul to our Party. During the Cultural Revolution, I was persecuted, and the "Gang of Four" gave me five hats: "Colluding with foreigners," "Reactionary academic authority," etc. I did not yield, and I firmly believed that our Party would correctly solve the problem. After becoming the president, I led the entire faculty and students to rectify the chaos, and at that time, I had no Sundays, only Saturdays. Six years ago, after retiring from the front line, I devoted all my energy to training high school mathematics teachers, hoping that through them, I could further improve high school mathematics education.

I am an ordinary person, nothing special. I briefly reviewed these experiences to show that I followed the Party's education and leadership to take the road of serving the people. A person's abilities are big or small, I did what I could, and I did not let down my compatriots who nurtured me. It was the blood and sweat of the people that sent me abroad to study, and if I did not work for the people after returning, how could I face my country and the people!

I once swore: "Until my old age, I belong to the Party," and I will strive for the Party's cause for life. The reason I have today is that the Party gave it to me, and it is also the result of my efforts to make my heart beat with the pulse of the times. Some people seize on some problems of the Party and the state, oppose the four cardinal principles, and try to overthrow the socialist system, which is not feasible.

I also want to say that our country is worth loving. In just 40 years, it has become a great power standing in the East with a relatively strong foundation, able to solve the problem of feeding ten billion people. To revive China, apart from relying on us, there is no other way.

For more than a hundred years, how many people have yearned for education to revitalize the country, but before liberation, not only was it not possible, but our motherland became a semi-colony, subject to the butchery of others. We must remember this lesson from generation to generation. Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China. Without socialism, China cannot develop. I hope everyone remembers this.

Comrades, the times are calling on you, the historical mission is inspiring you, and the Party and the people are expecting you. I wish you all become a new generation and make more contributions to the modernization drive!

### 同学们，中华的振兴在召唤你们

    同学们，中华的振兴在召唤你们
    苏步青
    同学们，今天我有机会和同学们见面，谈谈自己的经历，非常高兴。
    为振兴中华而发奋读书是我们进大学的目的。复旦是名牌大学，有很好的师资和教研设施。进了这个大门，要有光荣感，还要有责任感。从这次动乱看，它给国家的经济建设和同学们的学业都带来了严重损失。党的十三届四中全会对这次动乱的起因、性质作了正确阐述。国庆前夕，江泽民总书记又作了重要讲话，对中国今后的建设发展提出了纲领性计划，在今后一个较长的时间里我们要结合学校实际认真学习这篇讲话。
    我是在清朝出生，旧社会里长大的，我们之间存在差别，这很自然。从这次学潮来看，年轻人对旧中国不认识，对国情不了解，对西方民主盲目向往，甚至个别人以为什么都是外国好，所以我觉得很有必要讲讲我亲身的经历和体会，希望同学们在今后的人生道路上更好地学习、更好地做人。
    我经历了中国的昨天，旧中国是怎样地被帝国主义列强瓜分和宰割，我深有体会。1919年我途经作为当时半殖民地、半封建中国缩影的上海，亲眼看到了外白渡桥边公园上挂的“华人与狗，不得入内”的牌子；黄浦江上停满炮口对着中国的帝国主义列强的军舰；南京路上每逢冬天都有冻死的人。当时的中国人是劣种人，是“东亚病夫”。现在呢？我们成了世界健儿；黄浦公园成了人民的公园；黄浦江上停着的是我们自己制造的万吨轮；南京路上一片欣欣向荣的景象。通过这些对比很能说明问题，没有共产党就没有新中国。共产党不但领导我们推翻了三座大山，建立人民共和国，更重要的是在解放后将一盘散沙的中国团结起来，没有党的领导，单是知识分子之间的团结就不可能。
    我从17岁到日本留学的时候起，到1949年解放止，在这30年里，我过了三个大关。
    1931年我得到东北帝国大学理学博士的学位，我是获得这一学位的第二个中国人，当时日本的大小报纸都登了这个消息。后来，我在大学担任讲师，日本报纸登道：非帝国的臣民却当上了帝国大学的讲师。为什么，就是因为看不起中国人。我的导师很好，还是帮助我当上了讲师。获得博士学位后，老师、同学们都劝我不要回国，去当台湾大学副教授，我想了想，决定还是回国。当时国民党政府大学的聘书上写着月俸大洋300元，可工资要4个月后才能发放，连零用钱也没有。当时我很想回去，日本母校留着我的职位，爱人和两个孩子也仍留在日本。浙江大学的校长邵斐子先生得知这消息后，连夜从南京赶回来，一清早敲开我的门，对我说：“你无论如何不能走，你是我们学校的宝贝！”“士为知己者死”，当时我是这么想的，便留了下来。邵校长千方百计地给我1200元当路费。1931年夏天我终于把爱人和孩子带回国来了。那一年春节，我一家穷得无法过年，邵校长又典当了自己的皮袍，把换来的26元交给我，这是第一个关。
    第二个关是在抗战时期。东北帝国大学以我的原来导师的名义打来电报，让我回母校，同时，岳父过世，岳母家也打来电报催促成行。我爱人很好，坚决不回去。结果没有去日本，而跟着浙江大学内迁到贵州。住的是一座破庙，穷苦之极，大约有半年左右，过着蘸盐巴吃地瓜当饭的生活。尽管如此，还是带出了4个研究生。天无绝人之路，在困难面前不低头的人是一定会成功的。这样，总算过了第二个关。
    第三个关是在解放前，1948年，我担任国民党中央研究院院士。当时，我在杭州，为了维持生计，我还得到航空学校去教三角，再加上教授的收入，去换几担米，让一家八口人填饱肚子。1949年4月，国民党政府想把我和我的一家带到台湾，并准备好机票。我感到气氛不对，坚决不走。在我的学生中，谷超豪同志是个地下党员，他发动同学推选我作训导长，没有这个同学，我还不知道什么是共产党。杭州解放的那一天，谷超豪同志来了，向我祝贺道：解放了，生活可以好起来了。就在他们这批学生的帮助下，我渡过了第三个关。
    解放后，我决心一定要把教学、科研搞上去。1958年我向党提出申请，1959年入党，从此我一心一意，把整个身心献给我们的党。“文革”期间我受到迫害，“四人帮”一伙共给了我5顶帽子：“里通外国”、“反动学术权威”等，我没有屈服，我坚信，我们党会正确解决问题。当了校长后，我率领全校师生拨乱反正，那时我没有星期天只有星期七。6年前，退居二线后，我将所有的精力放到培训中学数学教师上，希望通过他们能够进一步提高中学的数学教育。
    我这个人很普通，没什么了不起，我简单地回顾这一些想说明：我是在党的教育和领导下，走上为人民服务的道路的。一个人能力有大小，我做了我力所能及的工作，没有愧对培养我的同胞。是人民的血汗供我出国留学，回来后不为人民工作又如何对得起祖国和人民！
    我曾经起誓：“此身到老属于党”，为党的事业奋斗终身。我之所以有今天，是党给我的，也是我努力使自己的心跟着时代的脉搏一起跳动的结果。有些人抓住党和国家的一些问题，反对四项基本原则，妄想推翻社会主义制度，那是行不通的。
    我还要讲，我们的国家是值得我们爱的，她用短短的40年就建立了屹立于世界东方、又有比较强大的基础，能够解决十亿人口温饱的大国。要振兴中华，除了靠我们，此外别无良策。
    百多年来，多少人渴望过教育兴国，但解放前不但不行，祖国反而成了半殖民地，任人宰割，我们要世世代代牢记这一教训。没有共产党就没有新中国，没有社会主义就不能发展中国。我希望大家牢记这一点。
    同学们，时代召唤着你们，历史的重任在激励着你们，党和人民在期待着你们，愿你们成为一代新人，为现代化建设多作贡献！
