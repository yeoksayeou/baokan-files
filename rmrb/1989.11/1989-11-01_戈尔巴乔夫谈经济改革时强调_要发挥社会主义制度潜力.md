	Gorbachev Emphasizes the Need to Harness the Potential of the Socialist System During Economic Reforms

	MOSCOW, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) — Soviet leader Gorbachev, while discussing the advancement of Soviet economic reforms, stressed the need to harness the potential of the socialist system and opposed steering the country's development towards social democracy.

	Gorbachev made these remarks at a meeting convened by the CPSU Central Committee on Oct. 23 to discuss the national economic situation and ways to overcome difficulties with renowned economists. The Soviet newspaper Pravda published his speech and excerpts from the scholars' remarks on Oct. 30.

	Gorbachev believes that the key issue is how to understand the society that the reforms aim to build. He said, "We want to infuse socialism with new vitality through reforms and harness the potential of the socialist system."

	Gorbachev emphasized that the historical path taken by the Soviet Union over the past 72 years since the October Revolution should not be abandoned. He criticized those who call for a return to the February bourgeois revolution of 1917 and starting anew, pointing out that such calls essentially mean steering the country towards social democracy.

	Academician Laptev of the Institute of State and Law of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, while discussing property law, said that if private ownership is legalized, the mafia might seize economic power. He warned that if enterprises are allowed to be bought out, it would mean abandoning socialism and unknowingly sliding from communism to social democracy, as Lenin had pointed out. He said that developing commodity-money relations and expanding the autonomy of enterprises and regions is the correct path, but Lenin's principle of democratic centralism should still be maintained. Some economists called for a fight against the "black market," restructuring the commercial system, and abolishing the state monopoly on retail goods.

	Gorbachev announced at the meeting that such discussions would continue to be held to formulate the correct economic policies and avoid repeating past mistakes.

    戈尔巴乔夫谈经济改革时强调
    要发挥社会主义制度潜力
    新华社莫斯科10月30日电　苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫在谈到推进苏联经济改革时，强调发挥社会主义制度的潜力，反对把国家的发展引上社会民主主义的轨道。
    戈尔巴乔夫是在10月23日苏共中央召集著名经济学家讨论国家经济形势和克服困难的途径的会议上讲这番话的。《真理报》30日发表了他的讲话和学者们的发言摘要。
    戈尔巴乔夫认为，问题的关键首先在于如何理解通过改革所要建设的社会。他说，我们想通过改革赋予社会主义以新的活力，发挥社会主义制度的潜力。
    戈尔巴乔夫强调不能摒弃十月革命72年来苏联走过的历史道路。他对有人号召返回到1917年2月资产阶级革命时期并“从零开始”这种作法进行了批判，指出这种号召实质上意味着要求国家转到社会民主主义的轨道上去。
    苏联科学院国家和法律研究所的拉普捷夫院士在谈到所有制法时说，如果使私有制合法化，那么黑手党就可能夺取经济权。他警告说，如果允许赎买企业的话，那么就会像列宁指出的那样，定会抛弃社会主义，不知不觉地从共产主义滑到社会民主主义。他说，发展商品货币关系、扩大企业和地区的自主权是一条正确的道路，但还应保持列宁的民主集中制原则。有的经济学家呼吁同“黑市”进行斗争，改组商业体制，取消国家对零售商品的垄断。
    戈尔巴乔夫在会上宣布，这样的讨论会还将继续举行，以便制订正确的经济政策，避免重犯过去的错误。
