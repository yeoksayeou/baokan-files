China's men's basketball team won another match in the fifth Merlion Cup International Basketball Tournament held here tonight. They defeated the "Hongsheng" team from Taiwan, China, with a score of 92:66.

The Chinese team started strong, leading 10:2. However, the "Hongsheng" team then introduced two American players, strengthening their defense and interior offense.
