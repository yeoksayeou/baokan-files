The sixth edition of the Men's Volleyball World Cup entered its fifth round. The results of today's four matches were as follows: Cuba defeated Cameroon 3-0, Brazil narrowly defeated the United States 3-2, the Soviet Union defeated South Korea 3-1, and Italy defeated Japan 3-0.

Everyone expected today's four matches to be between the strong and the weak, but unexpectedly, Brazil defeated last year's Olympic champion, the United States, 3-2, creating the biggest upset since the start of the tournament. This has put the United States in a situation where even a bronze medal seems out of reach.

So far, Cuba has won all five of its matches, Italy has 4 wins and 1 loss, the Soviet Union and Brazil have 3 wins and 2 losses, the United States and Japan have 2 wins and 3 losses, South Korea has 1 win and 4 losses, and Cameroon has lost all five of its matches.

In terms of strength, if there are no surprises, Cuba, Italy, and the Soviet Union will likely win the gold, silver, and bronze medals, respectively. The competition will rest for one day tomorrow, and on the 25th, it will move to Tokyo for the final two rounds of matches.
