Just after the beginning of winter, the autumn chill has faded, and the air has become a bit colder. However, at the grain station in the ancient town of Shuangzhi in Wuxian County, Jiangsu Province, there is a bustling scene by the riverbank.

The clear, green water surface is filled with over a hundred grain boats, all loaded with golden new grain, neatly moored side by side along the dock. Farmers whose turn it is to weigh and sell their grain are humming lively work songs, sweating profusely as they busily move about. At the payment window, a crowd of people are waiting to receive their cash, with laughter occasionally breaking out from the group. The Shuangzhi Grain Management Office, which has been awarded the county's civilized unit for six consecutive years, is bustling with activity. The director, Old Ge, tells the reporter, "This autumn's grain harvest is bountiful, with a net increase of 108,000 kilograms compared to last year." He continues, "Before liberation, Shuangzhi had over 80 rice shops. Farmers who harvested a few more bushels would be exploited with price cuts. Now, the state values grain and the interests of grain farmers. This autumn's grain procurement price has been raised from 20.75 yuan per dan to 26.8 yuan. Farmers are very enthusiastic about selling their grain. In Qingfeng Village, all 105 of the 8-ton transport boats are used to transport grain, and 281,300 kilograms have been stored in just three days." Old Ge points to the farmers who are currently receiving their grain payments and says, "The county has taken the grain collection work very seriously, allocating special funds, settling accounts on the same day, and clearing them on the same day."

At this moment, a middle-aged woman on a small wooden boat nearby speaks to the reporter in thick Jiangnan Wu dialect, "I have 8 mu of contract land for my family of eight. This year's yield is quite good. My daughter works in a silk weaving factory, and life is much better than before." As she speaks, a small motorboat with a canopy approaches from the distance, making a "putt-putt" sound. A man is at the helm, while a woman stands at the bow holding a bamboo pole, looking for a place to moor.

Similarly, those who harvested a few more bushels in the past, as described by Mr. Ye Shengtao, suffered from exploitation and oppression. Today, on the "red" faces of the farmers, not only is the joy of a bountiful harvest evident, but also a longing and hope for a new life...

　　“多收了三五斗”
　　钱雪泉
    立冬刚过，秋意退尽，空气平添了几分寒意。然而在江南水乡江苏吴县古镇甪直粮站的河埠头上，却是一番热气腾腾的景象。
    碧绿清澈的水面上，上百条粮船满载金灿灿的新谷，头东尾西齐整整靠在码头边。轮到上磅售粮的农民，哼着欢快的号子，汗流满面，来回忙碌。结账的窗口，一群人围着等领现款，人群中不时传出阵阵谈笑声。粮船上在已经连续6年获县文明单位的甪直粮管所，主任老葛告诉记者，今年秋粮大丰收，比去年净增108万公斤。“解放前甪直有80多家米行，农民多收了三五斗，就压价剥削。现在国家重视粮食和粮农利益，今年秋粮收购价又从每担20.75元提到26.8元，农民售粮积极性很高。庆丰村105只8吨运输船都用来运粮，3天就入库28.13万公斤。老葛指着正在点粮款的农民又说：“县里对收粮工作抓得很紧，拨了专款，当天结，当天清。”
    这时，旁边一条小木船上一位中年农妇，操着浓重的江南吴语对记者说：“五奴（我）一家8亩责任田，今年产量蛮好。媛五（女儿）在丝织厂上班，日脚（日子）比以前好过多了。”说话间，远处一条挂梢机船“突突”而来，男的把舵，女的手握竹篙站立船头，正在寻觅空隙处歇船。
    同样多收了三五斗，昔日叶圣陶先生笔下的“旧毡帽朋友”，受尽敲榨欺凌。今天，在农民“酱赤”的脸上，不仅洋溢着丰收以后的欢乐，更流露出对新生活的憧憬和希冀……
