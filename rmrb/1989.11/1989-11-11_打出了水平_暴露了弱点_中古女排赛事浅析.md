The Chinese women's volleyball team lost to the Cuban team with a score of 1-3. Local volleyball experts and foreign journalists unanimously agreed that the Chinese team played to their strengths and showcased their unique style, leaving a lasting impression. The Cuban team truly represents the top level of current volleyball, and their victory is well-deserved. A calm analysis of the reasons for victory and defeat is more meaningful than mere lamentation.

Firstly, both teams carefully selected their lineups, making adjustments and enhancements. The Cuban team introduced the 33-year-old veteran setter Daisy, who had not played in the previous two matches. This move, made at a crucial moment, further strengthened the Cuban team's already formidable lineup. The Chinese team fielded their original starting lineup, with Li Yuming playing in the 4th position in the first set, clearly targeting Luis.

Secondly, as exemplified by Luis's performance in this match, the Cuban team's spiking was not as effective as it was against the Soviet team. Luis's spikes were blocked multiple times by Chinese players and often went out of bounds. The Cuban team's spiking was not the primary scoring method.

Thirdly, both teams aimed to disrupt the opponent's first pass through high-quality serves. The Cuban team, fearing that the Chinese team's first pass would be successful, preferred to make serving errors rather than reduce the aggressiveness of their serves. Throughout the match, the Cuban team made 18 serving errors, which speaks volumes. The Chinese team also focused on serving, preventing the opponent from easily executing high and powerful attacks. The Chinese team led during the periods when their serving was effective.

Fourthly, the Chinese team failed to seize opportunities and lacked decisive scoring methods. In the first half of each set, the Chinese team was leading, but they did not ultimately win except for the second set. The Cuban team's serving errors provided many opportunities for the Chinese team. For example, in the first set, when the Cuban team was leading 13-6, they made five consecutive serving errors, but the Chinese team did not capitalize on these scoring chances. Although the Chinese team's middle blockers played well today, they only managed to gain the serve. Ultimately, due to a lack of strong scoring methods, they missed these opportunities.

Fifthly, the weaknesses in blocking and first pass were further exposed. Cuban coach Eugenio pointed out in a press conference that he believed the Chinese team's blocking was weak. His view is not without merit. This weakness was just more evident in the match against the Cuban team.

    打出了水平　暴露了弱点
    ——中古女排赛事浅析
    中国女排以1比3负于古巴队。此间排球界人士和中外记者一致认为，中国队打出了水平、打出了风格，给人们留下难忘的印象。古巴队的确是当今排坛一流水平，夺杯在望，受之无愧。冷静地分析胜负原因，比一味感慨会更有意义。
    首先，双方在对垒阵容上都用心良苦，或有增强、或有变化。古巴队启用了在前两场比赛中未露面的老二传手戴杰斯，这位与郎平同时代的33岁老将出马于关键时刻，使古巴队本已雄厚的实力，又有所增强，中国队出场的还是原班主力阵容，第一轮让李月明打4号位，显然是针对路易斯的。
    其次，以路易斯在这场比赛中的表现为代表，古巴队的扣球不像与苏联队比赛时那样，发挥得淋漓尽致。路易斯的扣球也多次被中国选手拦住，还多次击球出界，古巴队的扣球并未成为得分主要手段。
    第三，双方都力图通过高质量发球，破坏对手一传。古巴队唯恐中国一传到位，打出快速多变的战术，而宁可发球失误，也不减低发球攻击力。全场比赛，古巴队发球失误高达18次，由此可见一斑。中国队也拚发球，不让对方顺利地高举高打，中国队领先的时候都是发球较好的时候。
    第四，未抓住时机，缺少制胜手段，4局的每个前半场，中国队都处于领先，除第2局外都未能最终取胜。古巴队的发球失误为我们提供了不少机会，如第一局，古巴队以13∶6领先时，曾5次连续发球失误，中国队未能抓住得分机会。虽然今天副攻打出了不少好球，但不过是发球权的易手。终因得分手段不强，错失良机。
    第五，拦网和一传的弱点进一步被暴露。古巴队教练欧亨尼奥在记者会见中指出，他认为中国队的拦网很弱。他的看法不无道理。这一弱点，只是在与古巴队比赛时暴露得更多一些。
