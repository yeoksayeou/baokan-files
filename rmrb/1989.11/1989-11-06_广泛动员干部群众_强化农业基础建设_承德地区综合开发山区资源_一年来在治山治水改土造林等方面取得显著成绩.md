Since last autumn, the Chengde region of Hebei Province has focused on mountain and water conservation and soil improvement, aiming to build a stable grain production base and comprehensively develop mountain resources. This has sparked a mass movement for agricultural infrastructure construction.

By the end of September this year, the region had accumulated 18.14 million man-days of labor for agricultural land construction, averaging 25.9 man-days per person. The region completed 31.35 million cubic meters of earthwork, drilled and restored 1,456 wells, renovated 414,500 mu of terraced fields, improved 187,400 mu of low- and medium-yield fields, prepared 1.05 million mu for afforestation, planted 7.99 million fruit trees, and managed 363.9 square kilometers of small watersheds.

Chengde is located in the Yanshan Mountains and is a key area for the development of forestry, fruit, and livestock in Hebei Province. In 1988, the Chengde Regional Committee organized cadres at all levels to conduct extensive discussions on economic development strategies across the region. This further clarified that in a poverty-stricken mountainous area like Chengde, it is essential to firmly implement the policy of rectification and strengthening the agricultural foundation.

To guide local areas in agricultural development, the Chengde Regional Committee and the Regional Government promoted three model practices across the region. The first is Xinglong County, which has organized the masses to afforest and plant fruit trees for over a decade, comprehensively developing the mountainous area and becoming the wealthiest county in the region. The second is Luanping County, which reformed the forestry management system, primarily investing by farmers with some state subsidies, and implemented project management. This organized tens of thousands of households to undertake large-scale rehabilitation of barren mountains and wastelands. The third is the experience of Xidi Village in Longhua County. These models have had a significant impact across the region. Counties, townships, and villages at all levels have formulated plans, with the region overseeing counties, and counties overseeing townships, signing responsibility letters at each level. The entire region has seen a large-scale agricultural construction boom.

The agricultural infrastructure construction projects in Chengde Region fall into four main categories: the "Two Fields Project" for comprehensive water and soil conservation, aiming to transform low-yield fields into high-yield and stable-yield fields; the "Three-North Shelterbelt System Construction" and the "Capital Surrounding Greening Project," focusing on the construction of water conservation forests, plain protection forests, and water conservation economic forests, integrating trees, shrubs, and grasses; the construction project for fruit orchards, which includes transforming low-yield orchards and building new high-standard, high-yield collective orchards at the village level; and the grassland construction project in the Bama and adjacent areas.

    广泛动员干部群众　强化农业基础建设
    承德地区综合开发山区资源
    一年来在治山治水改土造林等方面取得显著成绩
    本报讯　河北省承德地区自去年秋季以来，以治山治水改土为中心，以建设稳固的粮食生产基地，全面开发山区资源为目标，掀起群众性农业基础建设热潮。
    至今年9月底，全区累计投入农田建设积累工1814万个，劳均25.9个，完成土石方3135万立方米，新打和恢复机井1456眼，整修梯田41.45万亩，改造中低产田18.74万亩，造林整地105万亩，栽果树799万株，小流域治理363.9平方公里。
    承德地区位于燕山丛中，是河北省发展林、果、牧的重点区域。1988年承德地委组织各级干部在全区广泛开展了经济发展战略大讨论，进一步明确了在承德这样的贫困山区，必须坚定不移地贯彻治理整顿方针，强化农业基础。
    为了引导各地搞好农业开发，承德地委、行署在全区推广了3个典型。一是兴隆县连续十几年组织群众造林栽果，综合开发山区，成为全区首富之县。二是滦平县改革造林管理体制，以农民投资为主，国家适当补助，实行工程管理的办法，组织千家万户开展大规模的整治荒山荒滩。三是隆化县西地村的经验。这些典型在全区引起巨大反响。地县乡村层层制订规划，地对县，县对乡，层层签订了责任书，全区出现了大规模的农建热潮。
    承德地区农业基础建设工程有四大类型：以改造低产田，建设高产稳产田为目标的水土综合治理“两田工程”；以营造水源涵养林、川地防护林、水保经济林为主，乔、灌、草结合的“三北防护林体系建设”、“首都周围绿化工程”；以改造低产果园，新建村级集体高标准、高效益果园为内容的果林水配套的建设工程；坝上和接坝地区的草场建设工程。
