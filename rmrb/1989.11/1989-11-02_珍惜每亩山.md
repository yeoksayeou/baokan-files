Land area is limited, but protecting and utilizing land offers endless work for us to do. Our county is located in the northwest of Jiangxi, where mountainous areas account for 84.5% of the total area. It is often said, "Eight and a half parts mountains, half part fields, one part water, roads, and homesteads." Given our county's reality of one acre of arable land per person and 17 acres of mountains and forests, how do we tap into the land's potential? From our practice, we have concluded: we must cherish land as gold, and manage mountains as we do fields.

In the past, the northwest of Jiangxi had the scene of "cultivating mountains after exhausting the fields." However, by the 1970s, people's eyes were fixed only on the limited flatland arable area; they focused only on fields and neglected mountains, resulting in the situation where "trees rot on the mountains, people are poor at home, and they beg for food while holding a golden bowl." In 1980, our county invited melon farmers from Guangdong to implement cross-regional lease management, planting watermelons on the mountains. The planting area reached over 1,000 acres. People initially did not dare to imagine, but practice proved that watermelons grown on barren mountains were even better and sweeter than those grown on arable land. The income per acre ranged from a few hundred yuan to over a thousand yuan. People's horizons were broadened. "Advantages are in the mountains, potential is in the mountains, hope is in the mountains, and wealth comes from the mountains" became a consensus. In a few years, the entire county established 320,000 acres of fast-growing, high-yield forest bases, developed over 4,500 acres of barren mountains and slopes, and established numerous orchards, tea gardens, and bamboo forests. Each acre of timber forest averages 0.5 cubic meters of mature wood per year, and each acre of bamboo forest produces 400 kilograms of fresh bamboo shoots, whose value can compete with or even far exceed the average annual income of 200-plus yuan per acre of paddy fields in mountainous areas. Moreover, developing mountain land in a three-dimensional way not only brings considerable economic income but also regulates the climate, conserves water sources, and achieves significant ecological and social benefits.

In the past, we proposed the slogan of "not letting a single acre of land lie fallow." Why can't we propose the slogan of "cherishing every acre of mountain" now? Mountain land is also land, and it is the majority. It should not become a forgotten corner. The relationship between fields and mountains should be complementary. Why favor one over the other? We must change the long-standing practice of neglecting mountain land. If we can plan comprehensively, arrange reasonably, cultivate meticulously, and manage scientifically for mountains as we do for fields, mountains will definitely provide more and better products.

To solve the problem of farmers' lack of funds for developing mountain land and the long production cycle of forestry, we have promoted the practice of leasing mountains for afforestation across the county. The land development company invests, the contract farmers provide labor, and they jointly develop barren mountains and slopes, sharing the profits according to a certain ratio. After the contract period, the development results, including ownership and management rights, belong entirely to the development company. We also adopt the method of interest-free investment to encourage farmers to develop mountain land in clusters. The land development company is responsible for land planning, inspection, acceptance, and technical guidance, and provides seed, fertilizer, and financial assistance to individual farming households. The land ownership belongs to the collective, while the management rights and development results belong to the farmers. At the same time, we have experimented with the market for commercial timber from artificial forests to solve the contradiction between the long cycle of afforestation and the short-term interests of farmers, allowing the development results to be auctioned, inherited, and transferred. For already developed mountain land, the legal and land management departments issue land use certificates to protect the interests of developers. We deeply feel that managing mountains as we do fields is the inevitable path to tapping into land potential and accelerating the development of mountainous areas. Our hope lies in the green mountains.

专栏：怎样珍惜每寸土地？

    珍惜每亩山
    中共江西省铜鼓县委书记　陈达恒
    土地面积是有限的，保护和利用土地却有着无限的工作等待我们去做。我县地处赣西北，山区占总面积的84.5％，概称为“八分半山半分田，一分水面道路和庄园”。结合我县人均1亩耕地、17亩山林的实际情况，怎样挖掘土地潜力？我们从实践中得出的结论是：要惜地如金，像经营田那样经营山。
    赣西北山区曾有过“大田耕尽去耕山”的景象。然而，到了70年代，人们眼睛仅盯在有限的平原耕地面积上；只注重田，不重视山，致使山区“树在山上烂，人在家里穷，守着金饭碗讨饭吃”。我县于1980年从广东请来瓜农，实行跨地租赁经营，把西瓜种到山上，种植面积达1000多亩。人们开始不敢想象，实践却证明荒山上种的西瓜，比耕地上的西瓜长得更好更甜，每亩收入少则几百元，多则上千元。人们眼界大开。“优势在山，潜力在山，希望在山，致富靠山”，成了大家的共识。几年时间，全县建立了32万亩速生丰产林基地，开发荒山、荒坡4500多亩，建立了大批果园、茶园、笋竹两用林区，每年每亩用材林平均成材0.5立方米，每亩笋竹两用林产鲜笋400公斤，其价值可与山区每亩水田每年200多元平均收入相媲美，甚至大大超过。何况对山地进行立体开发，既有可观的经济收入，又可调节气候，涵养水源，获得巨大的生态效益和社会效益。
    过去我们曾提出过“不荒一亩田”的口号，现在为什么不可提出“珍惜每亩山”的口号呢？山地也是土地，而且是大头，不应该成为被遗忘的角落。田与山的关系，应该是相辅相成的，手心手背都是肉，何必厚此薄彼呢？我们必须改变长期以来忽视山地的做法。如果对山能像对田那样，全面规划，合理安排，精耕细作，科学管理，山就一定能像田那样提供更多更好的产品。
    为了解决农民开发山地的资金困难和林业生产周期长的问题，我们在全县推广租山贷款造林。由土地开发公司投资，承包经营者投劳，联合开发荒山、荒坡，实行按比例分成。承包期满后，开发成果所有权和经营权全部归开发公司。我们还采取无偿投资的办法，鼓励农民连片开发山地。土地开发公司承担土地规划、检查验收、技术指导的义务，对分户经营的农户给予种子、肥料及资金扶助，土地所有权归集体，经营权和开发成果归农户所有。同时，我们试行人工林立木商品市场，解决造林周期长与林农短期利益的矛盾，允许开发成果拍卖、继承和转让。对已开发的山地，由法律和土地管理部门签发土地使用证，用法律和乡规民约保护开发者的利益。我们深切地体会到，像经营田那样经营山，是挖掘土地潜力，加快山区发展的必由之路。我们的希望就在绿色的山地上。
