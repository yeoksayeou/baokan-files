Title: The Tree King

My hometown once had a tall pine tree. It stood rooted at the village entrance, weathering wind and rain, enduring the passage of time. Some people said it was the king of the trees in my hometown. Not far from the pine tree, there was once a mud-brick house. Its walls were weathered, but it still retained its charm, so tranquil and enchanting. This was Uncle Mei's home. Some people said Uncle Mei was the true tree king. Behind Uncle Mei's mud-brick house, there was an ancient tea tree. Uncle Mei said the tea tree was the tree king.

Uncle Mei once told me about his past with the pine tree. The year Uncle Mei was born, his parents, following an ancient village custom, planted a pine sapling in front of their house, sincerely praying that the sapling would grow with Uncle Mei, ensuring a life of safety and peace. He had a deep-seated aspiration. Whenever the pine seeds ripened, Uncle Mei would carefully collect them, storing them away. He thought that one day, he would plant them himself on the mountain. Year after year, Uncle Mei finally saw this day come. The county issued a document on afforestation. Uncle Mei was overjoyed and cultivated a large patch of pine saplings. In that spring, he planted hope across the mountains with the villagers.

Uncle Mei was warm-hearted. Every time I passed by his house, he would always affectionately call me over. I would smile and walk into the mud-brick house. Uncle Mei would always pour me a cup of strong tea. I would first take a big sip, then slowly savor it. At first, it was bitter, but upon closer tasting, it had a fragrant richness that permeated the bones and skin.

"Hey, Uncle, why don't you set up a tea stall under the pine tree and make some money?" I joked once.

"No, no, the tea tree is ours. As long as we work hard, how can we take money from others?" Uncle Mei shook his head with a bitter smile.

Uncle Mei had an old tea tree. During the harvest season, he would carefully pluck and select the leaves, then dry them, roast them carefully, and roll and rub them finely. He would then give some to the neighbors and keep the rest to brew and drink himself, or to offer to passersby. Year after year, the old tea would spoil, and Uncle Mei would have to painfully pour it into the small river, letting the river carry it away.

"Spring breeze brings green to the southern bank," the river once carried away the sweetness of life, but now it brings even sweeter life. In the mountains, where there was an abundance of sorghum and wheat, Uncle Mei, after much deliberation, applied and built a small brewery.

Who says that what Uncle Mei started was just a brewery? Who says Uncle Mei was just brewing alcohol?

Once, Uncle Mei, squinting, looked at the pine tree in front of his door and muttered to himself, "The brewery needs to be expanded, this tree is just right for a beam, but I feel bad for my mother."

"You can't, Uncle. The whole village is watching it. It's still growing vigorously."

"Hohoho, it won't grow for much longer. Look over there—" Uncle Mei pointed to the opposite mountain and continued, "The whole village is watching these trees. They are the hope of the mountains."

Yes, hope! These trees on the mountains not only maintain ecological balance but also maintain the psychological balance of the people.

The pine tree was eventually felled by Uncle Mei, and the mud-brick house was replaced. The pine tree beams stretched from end to end, long and sturdy!

Who is the tree king? Over the years, I have been pondering this question. The pine tree was once the tallest and thickest tree in the village. Its seeds were scattered throughout the wilderness, but it was felled by Uncle Mei; the tea tree, with its long history, has quietly lain here for thousands of years, recording the turning of the stars and the moon, the changes of nature, and the rise and fall of society. Now, it still stands, silently giving. Uncle Mei's reasoning for considering it the tree king is not without merit. But I always feel it can only be an "old man tree"; and what about my Uncle Mei? Isn't he the true tree king?

    树王
    张路刚
    我的故乡，曾有一棵高大的针叶松。它扎根于村口，栉风沐雨，历尽沧桑。有人说，它是我故乡的树中之王。离针叶松不远，曾有一座土坯房，壁影斑驳，然而它仍不失其韵致，是那样的安详、恬静、迷人，这是梅大叔的家。有人说，梅大叔才是真正的树王。梅大叔的土坯房后面，有一棵古老的茶树。梅大叔说，茶树才是树王。
    大叔曾向我讲述他与针叶松的往事。大叔出生那年。大叔的父母亲尊行山村古老的风俗，在家门前栽下了一株松苗，虔诚祈祷树苗与大叔一起长大，一生平安无事。他有一个深埋着的憧憬。每当松籽熟的时节，大叔就小心翼翼地打下，收藏，他想，总有一天，自己要将它们亲手种在山上。一年又一年，大叔终于盼来了这一天，县里下达了植树造林的文件。大叔欣喜若狂，他培植了一大片松苗，于那个春天，和山民们一起，种下了满山的希望。
    大叔对人热情，我每次从他家门前通过，他总是亲昵地招呼我过去。我便笑笑，走进土坯房。大叔总为我倒一杯酽酽的茶。我总是先大喝一口，然后慢慢地呷，乍苦，凝神细品，却有一丝浸骨润肤的香醇。
    “咳，大叔，你咋不在松树下摆个茶摊，赚钱呢？”有一次，我开玩笑说。
    “不，不，自家的茶树，只要人勤点，怎好去赚人家的钱呢？”大叔苦笑着摇头。
    大叔有一棵老龄的茶树，收摘季节，他总是细心地剪摘，精心地挑选，然后晾干，又小心地烘，细细地捻，细细地揉，弄好，东家送一包，西家捎一袋，剩下的，泡茶细饮，招待路人。一年又一年，陈茶变质了，大叔不得不忍痛将之倾进小河里，河水流走了。
    “春风又绿江南岸”，河水曾流走生活的甘醇，而今又流来了更甘醇的生活。大叔在山里高粱、麦子吃不完的情况下，几经斟酌，一经申请，一座小酒坊建成了。
    谁说在大叔手里兴起的只是酒坊呢？谁说大叔只是在酿酒呢？
    有一次，大叔眯着眼，望着门前的针叶松，自言自语地说：“酒坊要扩建了，这树正好作梁，只是觉得对不起母亲。”
    “不能的，大叔，全村人都看着它呢，它还在一个劲儿地向上窜。”
    “嗬嗬，它窜不了多久了，喏，你看——”大叔指着对面山上，接着说：“全村人看的是这满山的树，他们是山里的希望。”
    是啊，希望！这满山的树、不仅维持了生态平衡，而且还维持了人们的心理平衡。
    针叶松终被大叔锯倒了，土坯房也被换掉了，那针叶松做的屋梁一统到底，够长、够坚！
    谁是树王呢？这些年我一直在想这个问题。针叶松曾是村里最高最粗的树，它的种子撒遍了山野，可它被大叔锯倒了；茶树，有悠长的历史，千百年来，静静地掩卧在这里，记载星转斗移，记载自然变更，记载社会兴衰，如今，它依然鹤发童颜，默默奉献，大叔以它为树王不是没有道理。可是我总觉得它只能是一棵“老人树”；我的大叔呢？难道他不是确确实实的树王吗？
