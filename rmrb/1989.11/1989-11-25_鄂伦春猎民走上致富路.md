The Oronchon hunters of Inner Mongolia's Oronchon Autonomous Banner have united and supported each other, developing various industries such as agriculture, animal husbandry, sideline production, and forestry. Over the past eight years, the total social output value has increased fivefold. In the past three years, the development of various industries and economic benefits in this banner have ranked first and second among the 13 banners (counties) and cities in Hulunbuir League.

The tide of reform and opening up has swept through the Oronchon hunter villages, breaking the long-standing isolation of their mountain fortresses. With the active assistance of Han and Mongolian people, they have developed agricultural and pastoral production. Now, 68% of the Oronchon hunter households are engaged in the artificial cultivation of wood ear mushrooms, making the annual production of dried wood ear mushrooms reach 200,000 kilograms, with a pure income of 5.8 million yuan. The per capita income of the Oronchon hunters has increased from 32 yuan 10 years ago to 567 yuan.
