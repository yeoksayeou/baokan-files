The former director of the Guiyang Locomotive Section, Duan Han Cai, deputy director Xu Ji Bin, and the Party Committee secretary Zhang Fa Ming, were finally brought to the court. At the public trial held by the Chengdu Railway Transport Intermediate Court on November 11th, Duan, Xu, and Zhang were sentenced to eight years, ten years, and two years of imprisonment, respectively.

An investigation revealed that since September 1985, Duan Han Cai, Xu Ji Bin, and Zhang Fa Ming had been using their authority to illegally handle locomotive diesel, locomotive coal, and scrap locomotive parts, amassing illegal income totaling over 3.25 million yuan. They then transferred 2.8 million yuan of this amount into 11 privately set "small treasuries," embezzling and squandering the funds. They used the "small treasuries" 31 times to purchase gold jewelry, household appliances, furniture, high-end cigarettes, liquor, and medicines. The total amount of cash and goods embezzled by Duan Han Cai, Xu Ji Bin, and Zhang Fa Ming amounted to over 97,000 yuan.
