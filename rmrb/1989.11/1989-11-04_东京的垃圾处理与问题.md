At the end of September to the beginning of October this year, a large-scale fly infestation occurred along the coast of Tokyo Bay. After investigation, health authorities discovered that the fly swarms originated from the garbage dump outside the central breakwater of Tokyo Port. Japanese public opinion is worried that this is an "ominous sign," saying it is "nature's revenge."

Currently, Japan's garbage disposal is at a relatively advanced level internationally. For example, garbage recycling, sanitary treatment technology, the use of electronic computers in incinerators, waste heat power generation, and hot water supply systems are all quite developed. Just the waste heat power generation from Tokyo's garbage incinerators reaches 370 million kilowatts, with a value of 1.4 billion yen.

However, with the development of the economy, the amount of garbage discharged in Tokyo has been increasing rapidly. In the fiscal year 1988, the 23 wards of Tokyo discharged a total of 4.8 million tons of garbage, an increase of 1 million tons compared to 1983. In 1988, out of the 3.52 million tons of combustible garbage discharged in Tokyo, only 2.8 million tons were incinerated, while the rest was directly transported to the dump, which is one of the causes of the "fly disaster" in Tokyo Bay.

The main reasons for the sharp increase in garbage discharge in Tokyo include: the increase in the amount of copy paper due to the development of office automation; the increase in disposable tableware in fast food restaurants; the lack of recycling of various bottles, cans, and waste paper in households; and the disposal of many still-usable household appliances and vehicles.

Due to the sharp increase in garbage discharge in Tokyo, the garbage dump outside the central breakwater, which was originally expected to be used until 1995, will be full in just three years. Facing these severe problems, Japanese public opinion has realized that the previous view that "garbage disposal is within the scope of administrative management and has nothing to do with me" is no longer feasible.

Now, some people have proposed the issue of implementing a garbage disposal fee system based on the amount of garbage disposed of. Because this will definitely curb the amount of garbage discharged. Once this system is implemented, many people will eat the carrot leaves that were previously thrown away, make "mandarin tea" from mandarin peels; if there is a yard at home, some garbage can be buried in the soil to increase fertility; containers that were previously thrown away can also be recycled. However, implementing this system will also raise concerns that it is biased towards the rich, whether people with money have the right to discharge more garbage?

    东京的垃圾处理与问题
    刘迪
    今年9月末至10月初，日本东京湾沿岸出现了大规模的苍蝇群。经调查，卫生当局发现蝇群产生于东京港中央防波堤外侧的垃圾填埋地。对此，日本舆论忧心忡忡，担心这是一种“不祥的前兆”，并说这是“大自然的报复”。
    目前，日本的垃圾处理在国际上处于较先进的地位。例如垃圾回收、卫生的处理技术、使用电子计算机的焚烧炉、余热发电及供应热水系统等均较发达。仅东京都的垃圾焚烧炉余热发电量就达3.7亿千瓦，产值14亿日元。
    但是，随着经济的发展，东京的垃圾排放量猛增，1988年度，东京都的23个区共排放垃圾480万吨，比1983年度增长了100万吨。1988年度，东京都排放的352万吨可燃性垃圾中，仅有280万吨得到焚烧，其余直接运往填埋地，这是造成东京湾发生“蝇灾”的原因之一。
    东京都垃圾排放量激增的主要原因有：随着办公室自动化的发展，复印用纸大量增加；快餐业一次性餐具增加；家庭中各种瓶罐及废纸未得到回收等。此外，许多尚可使用的家电、运输工具等也被废弃。
    由于东京垃圾排放量激增，本来预计可使用到1995年的东京中央防波堤外侧的垃圾填埋地再过三年就将“爆满”。面对上述严峻的问题，日本舆论认识到，以往那种“垃圾处理是行政管理的范围，与己无关”的看法已行不通了。
    现在，有人提出实行倾倒垃圾按量收费制度的问题。因为这样肯定会抑制垃圾排放量。一旦实行这种制度，许多人会把过去扔掉的萝卜叶子吃掉，把柑桔皮做成“柑桔茶”；如果家里有院子，会将某些垃圾埋入土中增加肥力；习惯扔掉的容器也可得到回收。但是实行这种制度，也会有人担心这是偏向富人，是否有钱的人就有权利多排放垃圾呢？
