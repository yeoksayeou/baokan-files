The fourth round of the Vienna negotiations on conventional arms in Europe began on November 9th at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. Neither NATO nor the Warsaw Pact proposed new arms reduction suggestions before this round of talks. This round of negotiations is based on the gradual convergence of positions between the two military blocs after the previous three rounds. People in Vienna generally believe that this round of talks will further promote the process of conventional arms reduction in Europe.

Starting from the fourth round of negotiations, the United States appointed James Woolsey to replace Laird as the head of the U.S. delegation for the European conventional arms reduction talks.

This round of negotiations will conclude on December 21st.
