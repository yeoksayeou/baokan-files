Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 8th.

The State Language Commission today awarded certificates of honor to 425 individuals nationwide who have dedicated 30 years to language and literature work, recognizing their diligent efforts in the field.

Among the recipients of these certificates of honor are those who specialize in language and literature work, as well as individuals from the scientific and educational sectors who have shown enthusiasm for language and literature work. In a telephone conference today, Vice Chairman Wang Jun of the State Language Commission praised them, saying, "For decades, they have worked tirelessly, selflessly, and with a sense of honor, treating language and literature work as their sacred duty."

It is understood that over the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, China's language and literature work has made significant progress. The publication of the "Scheme for the Simplification of Chinese Characters" has reduced the burden on learners, creating conditions for the promotion of education and literacy. From 1956 to 1988, a total of 620 million primary school graduates and literacy program completers in mainland China learned simplified characters. Additionally, the promotion of Mandarin has also achieved remarkable results. Currently, the majority of urban residents and some rural areas with conditions have a certain ability to use Mandarin. Mandarin has not only become the teaching language in normal schools, urban primary schools, and some rural primary schools but has also entered society. Currently, the "Scheme for the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet" as the unified standard for the Romanization of Chinese names and place names has been recognized by relevant international organizations.

Wang Jun, in his speech, hoped that those who follow in the language and literature field can learn from the spirit of these honored seniors, and do an even better job in the new era of language and literature work.

    国家表彰425位语文工作者
    新华社北京11月8日电  国家语言文字工作委员会今天授予全国425位从事语言文字工作30年的同志荣誉证书，以表彰他们在语文战线上的辛勤耕耘。 
    这批荣誉证书的获得者中，有专门从事语言文字工作的，也有科技、教育界中热心语言文字工作的同志。国家语委副主任王均在今天的电话会上称赞他们：数十年如一日，勤勤恳恳，不计名利，把语言文字工作当作自己的光荣任务。
    据了解，我国的语言文字工作建国40年来取得了很大进展。《汉字简化方案》的公布，减轻了学习者的负担，为普及教育和扫盲创造了条件。从1956年到1988年，我国大陆共有6.2亿小学毕业生和扫盲结业学员学习了简化字。此外，推广普通话工作也取得了显著成效。目前城市和一些有条件的农村绝大多数人具有一定的使用普通话的能力，普通话不仅成为师范学校、城市小学和部分农村小学的教学用语，并且已经走向社会。目前《汉语拼音方案》作为我国人名、地名罗马字母拼写法的统一规范，已得到国际有关组织的承认。
    王均在讲话中希望语言文字战线上的后来者能学习这些受表彰的老同志的精神，把新时期语言文字工作做得更好。
