Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 16th.

Central state organs have acted swiftly on orders to revoke over a thousand companies. The National Leading Group for the Clean-up and Rectification of Companies approved the first batch of 1,018 companies to be revoked today.

After the National Leading Group for the Clean-up and Rectification of Companies issued the "Opinions on the Revocation and Merger of Companies Under Central State Organs" in September, various departments have taken proactive measures and recently submitted their first batch of company revocation lists.

The 1,018 companies revoked this time include 982 companies from 50 departments under the State Council and 36 companies from 7 departments under the Central Committee. Among these, 50 companies are directly managed by various departments and are national-level or first-tier companies, accounting for 5%; 389 companies are second-tier, accounting for 38%; and 579 companies are third-tier, accounting for 57%.

The first batch of companies revoked by central state organs focuses on the excessive number of companies in the circulation sector, which account for 57.1% of the revoked companies. Next are companies with similar or overlapping main businesses, and thirdly, companies that have been poorly managed for a long time, with weak management and poor economic and social benefits. The handling of assets, debts, and the arrangement of personnel for these revoked companies is generally not difficult.

It is reported that in determining the first batch of companies to be revoked, 10 departments have shown strong resolve and taken decisive actions. The State Commission for Economic Restructuring has decided to revoke all three of its companies; Guangming Daily has 28 companies, of which 24 have been revoked. The Chemical Industry Bureau, Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, Ministry of Non-Ferrous Metals, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Chemical Industry, Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Machinery and Electronics, Ministry of Light Industry, China National Offshore Oil Corporation, and China State Shipbuilding Corporation have also revoked a significant number of companies. The companies revoked by these 10 departments account for 65% of the total number of companies revoked by central state organs in the first batch. Currently, various departments are continuing to work diligently to prepare the next batch of companies for revocation and merger as soon as possible.
