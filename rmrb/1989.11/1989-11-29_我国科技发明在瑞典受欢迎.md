Chinese technological inventions have been well-received in Sweden. Our reporter, Gu Yaoming, reports from Stockholm on November 26:

Chinese technological inventions on display at the International Invention Exhibition in Stockholm have attracted significant attention from Swedish business circles and visitors.

More than 50 companies and research institutions from Zhejiang, Hebei, Shanxi, Beijing, Wuhan, and Shenzhen have showcased over 150 invention projects. These exhibits provide a glimpse into some of the practical scientific and technological innovations made in China in recent years. Among the highlights are Zhejiang's thin plate welding, the Chinese Academy of Forestry's rooting powder, Hebei's Cangxiu stone, Shenzhen's rapid calculation and layout, and Wuhan's micro-clearance device, all of which have sparked considerable interest among visitors. Each day, numerous visitors flock to the Chinese exhibition booth, inquiring about the technology and requesting technical brochures. At the Zhejiang thin plate welding machine, many visitors personally operated the machine to weld one-millimeter-thick steel plates, taking the welded plates and welding rods as souvenirs. Experts from Finland, the Soviet Union, and Sweden in the fields of agriculture and forestry have highly praised the rooting powder technology and expressed their desire to collaborate with Chinese experts on this project.

Several Swedish companies and research institutions have expressed their willingness to introduce Chinese new technologies and assist in promoting Chinese technological products.

　　我国科技发明在瑞典受欢迎
    本报斯德哥尔摩11月26日电　记者顾耀铭报道：正在这里参加国际发明展览会的中国科技发明项目受到瑞典企业界和观众的重视和欢迎。
    来自浙江、河北、山西、北京、武汉、深圳等地的50多家公司和研究单位的150多个发明项目参加了展出，使观众看到我国近年来在实用科学技术发明方面的一部分成果。其中浙江的薄板焊接、中国林科院的生根粉、河北的藏秀石、深圳的快速计算放样、武汉的微型清醒器等项目引起观众浓厚的兴趣。每天都有很多观众到中国展台参观，向中国技术人员询问和索取技术说明书。在浙江的薄板焊接机前，不少观众自己动手焊接一毫米的钢板，并把焊接好的钢板和焊条带回去作纪念。来自芬兰、苏联和瑞典的农林业专家对生根粉技术给予高度评价，希望同中国专家进行这个项目的合作研究。
    瑞典一些公司和研究单位表示愿意引进中国的新技术，并帮助推销中国的科技新产品。
