    The town of Creil is located in the northern suburbs of Paris. Who could have imagined that this small town would spark a controversy that would engulf the entire country in a heated debate?

    The incident began simply enough: a public high school in Creil had a few Muslim girls who wore traditional Islamic headscarves to school. The principal ordered them to choose between the headscarves and the school. Two students subsequently left the school. Soon, school administrators in Marseille, Montpelier, Avignon, and other cities followed suit. This action immediately sparked a strong reaction among Muslims. Student parents threatened to sue the principal for racial discrimination, and their relatives organized support committees. Over 800 Muslims in Paris even organized a protest march, demanding the right for students to wear headscarves in school.

    The incident stirred up a storm of opinions across France. Over the course of a week, Parisian newspapers, large and small, dedicated extensive coverage to the issue daily. Television and radio stations were also filled with related news.

    Those who supported the principal's actions argued that schools should uphold the principles of secular education. Opponents, however, emphasized religious freedom and the freedom to dress as one pleases, asserting that the principal's ban violated these principles.

    The issue was also debated in Parliament. Members of the Democratic Alliance argued that if headscarves were allowed in schools, other religions in France would make similar demands, potentially leading to the country's fragmentation. Republican Party members demanded strict adherence to the separation of education and religion. Far-right member Jean-Marie Le Pen even claimed that wearing headscarves in France was a provocative act that could spark a religious war.

    Education Minister Lionel Jospin of the Socialist Party government stated in the National Assembly that schools are primarily educational institutions and should welcome students, but that the principle of secularism in schools should be upheld. His remarks garnered applause from many right-wing members but drew criticism from some within his own party. Two Socialist Party members even wore headscarves in the assembly hall in protest.

    The French public is not unfamiliar with the Islamic headscarf, but what is the real issue behind the current debate? Le Figaro newspaper pointed out that compared to the problem of millions of foreign immigrants in France, the headscarf incident is secondary. It merely forces French society to confront this pressing social issue.

    France has long had a conflicted attitude towards immigration. It prides itself on being an "open society" but also implements stricter restrictions. Economically, France needs a large number of foreign workers to support its economic development and daily social needs. Many dangerous and physically demanding jobs that French people avoid, such as cleaning and municipal engineering in Paris, are almost exclusively done by Arabs and Africans. However, the influx of tens of thousands of immigrants each year makes it increasingly difficult for the authorities to manage.

    The total number of foreign immigrants in France has reached 4.5 million, and this number is still growing. In some cities, foreign immigrants make up 25% of the population. The French authorities fear that a large number of immigrants will affect France's social stability and exacerbate a series of existing social problems. Like previous right-wing governments, the current Socialist Party government is also grappling with the thorny issue of foreign immigrants.

    “头纱事件”的背后
    本报记者　吕网大
    克莱耶是巴黎北部一座小镇。谁能料到这个小镇掀起的风波却在全法国引起一场大论战。
    事件起因很简单：该市一所公立中学有几名伊斯兰教家庭的女孩子戴着传统的伊斯兰头纱上学，校长便勒令她们在面纱和学校之间作出选择。为此，两名女学生离开了学校。接着，马赛、蒙贝利埃、阿维农等城市的学校领导也纷纷效法。这一行动立即在伊斯兰教徒中引起了强烈反应。学生家长要以种族歧视罪控告校长，她们的亲友则组织了声援委员会。在巴黎的800多名伊斯兰教徒还组织了示威游行，要求学生有戴头纱上学的权利。
    一石激起千层浪。法国各界人士纷纷发表见解。一周当中，巴黎大小报纸几乎天天以大量篇幅报道，电视、广播整天也是此类消息。
    赞成校长措施的人认为，学校应贯彻的是世俗教育的原则。持反对态度的人则强调宗教信仰和服饰自由，认为校长的禁令违背了这一原则。
    议会也在讨论“头纱事件”。民主联盟的议员认为，如果允许在学校戴头巾，法国境内的其它宗教就会有同样的要求，结果将导致法国的分裂；共和党议员则要求严格遵守教育与宗教分离的原则；极右派议员勒庞还煞有介事地说，在法国戴头纱是一种挑衅行为，这将成为法国宗教战争的开端。
    社会党政府的教育部长若斯潘在国民议会表示，学校首先是个教育场所，应该接待、欢迎学生，但学校的世俗原则应该坚持，他的话赢得不少右翼议员的掌声，却招来一些同党的不满，两名社会党议员公然在议会大厅戴上了头纱，以示抗议。
    法国社会对伊斯兰头纱并不陌生，现在争论的实质是什么呢？费加罗报指出，与几百万在法国的外国移民问题相比，头纱事件是次要的。它无非要法国社会正视这个头痛的社会问题。
    法国在移民问题一直存在矛盾心理。它标榜是个“向外部世界开放的国家”，却又要采取更严格的限制措施。从经济上说，法国确需要一批外籍工人来支撑其经济发展和日常社会生活的需要，不少危险性行业、重而脏的体力活，法国人宁可领失业救济也不愿去干。如巴黎的清洁工作及市政工程，几乎清一色由阿拉伯人和非洲人“承包”了。但每年十几万移民涌来，又使当局感到越来越难以承受。
    法国的外国移民总数达到450万，目前每年还在增长，有的城市外国移民占到25％，法国当局又怕大量移民影响到法国社会的稳定，及由此带来的一系列问题，使原有的社会问题更加突出。同以前的右翼政府一样，法国社会党政府目前也面临着头痛而棘手的外国移民问题。
