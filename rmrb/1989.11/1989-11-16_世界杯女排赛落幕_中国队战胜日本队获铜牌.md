The fifth Women's Volleyball World Cup concluded at the Nagoya General Sports Hall. Cuba won the gold medal with a perfect 7-0 record. The Soviet Union secured the silver medal with a 6-1 record. China, with a 5-2 record, won the bronze medal. The rankings from fourth to eighth were as follows: Japan, Peru, East Germany, South Korea, and Canada.

The match between China and Japan was the final game of the World Cup. China defeated Japan 3-0 (15-13, 15-4, 15-7).

Today, the Soviet Union faced Canada. Their performance was a stark contrast to yesterday's. After losing the second set to Canada, who had lost all six of their previous matches, the Soviet team rallied and won 3-1 (15-8, 13-15, 15-9, 15-2).

In the match between Cuba and South Korea, even if Cuba had lost, they would still have been crowned champions. Due to the significant difference in strength, Cuba easily defeated South Korea 3-0 (15-8, 15-12, 15-4).

The match between Peru and East Germany produced an unexpected result. Peru won the first two sets, but East Germany came back to win the next three, securing a 3-2 victory (9-15, 6-15, 15-7, 16-14, 15-13).
