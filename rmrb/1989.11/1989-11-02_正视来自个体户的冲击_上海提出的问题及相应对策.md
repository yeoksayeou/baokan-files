Individual economies in Shanghai have developed rapidly in recent years. By the first half of this year, the city had 108,847 registered individual households, employing over 160,000 people, which is 13 times and 20 times more than in 1978, respectively. The registered capital amounts to over 300 million yuan, with a retail sales volume of nearly 700 million yuan. The positive role of individual economies in social and economic life should be acknowledged. They have expanded employment opportunities, promoted circulation, facilitated urban and rural living, and increased state fiscal revenue. However, issues such as high incomes, bribery of officials, illegal operations, and tax evasion among individual households have had economic, psychological, and moral impacts on society. Shanghai's relevant departments believe that it is necessary to strengthen the management of individual economies to ensure their healthy development.

Bribery as a means to success

Some unscrupulous individual households use bribery as a tool for getting rich. Materials from Shanghai's procuratorial organs show that bribery cases involving individual households are on the rise. During the investigation of a batch of bribery cases, a district procuratorate interrogated over 100 individual operators and found that almost all of them had engaged in bribery. The targets of bribery by unscrupulous individual households are mainly those who hold "life-and-death" management powers and those who control the allocation and supply of materials, exchanging these for scarce resources and seeking excessive profits. In July and August this year, the procuratorate of Yangpu District uncovered more than 50 bribery cases from Shanghai Fisheries First and Third Wholesale Departments, Shanghai Aquatic Products Processing Plant, and the Shanghai Branch of the China Fisheries Association. Among these, 15 cases involved amounts over 100,000 yuan, and 3 cases involved amounts over 200,000 yuan. The vast majority of the bribers were individual households. State functionaries who were implicated by unscrupulous individual households were mainly from the tax, industry and commerce, and public security sectors.

In recent years, the tax system in Shanghai has uncovered numerous cases of tax officials violating laws, many of which were due to bribery by unscrupulous individual operators.

The significant income disparity between individual households and ordinary workers is a major indicator of social inequity. The high income and ease of earning among individual households have led some employed workers and government officials to "defect" and join the ranks of individual households. In Luwan District, out of 4,000 individual operators, 985 were former employees, accounting for about one-quarter. The proportion of former employees among individual households increased by more than 20% in one year. Additionally, many employed workers engage in "daytime public, nighttime private" activities, operating without licenses, selling milk, or repairing bicycles during their off-hours, or working as assistants for individual households.

Earning illegal money, committing illegal acts

Some unscrupulous individual households earn illegal money and commit illegal acts, with some describing them as earning and spending recklessly. This recklessness poses a strong impact on national laws, moral ethics, and overall social customs.

"Getting rich quickly by evading national taxes" is the shortcut to wealth for some unscrupulous individual households. According to data from the Shanghai Taxation Bureau, about 70% of individual households evade taxes. The amounts typically range from a few thousand yuan to tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of yuan. According to current tax regulations, it is almost impossible for an individual household to get rich by paying taxes honestly. Even some individual households admit that it is difficult to get rich without evading taxes.

In July and August this year, the procuratorial and taxation departments in Shanghai cracked down on 22 major tax evasion cases involving individual operators, with a total evaded tax amount of 2.76 million yuan. Individual households use various methods to evade taxes, which relevant departments have investigated and categorized into 7 types and 60 methods.

Price gouging is a significant issue in individual operations. According to Shanghai's price inspection department, out of 110,000 individual households, the majority to varying degrees violate price policies. Some "exorbitant" individual taxis have become a major nuisance in Shanghai. The public transportation management department in Shanghai found 168 cases of individual taxis operating illegally in two months, with the majority involving overcharging and excessive fees. Additionally, issues such as shortchanging, adulteration, and disguised price increases are widespread.

Due to the generally low quality of individual operators, some use illegally earned money to commit further illegal acts. According to statistics from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, in 1987, 306 individual households in the city were sentenced to re-education through labor, with over 55% of these cases involving gambling. In the first four months of this year, 110 individual households were sent to re-education through labor, with 58 of them involving gambling, accounting for over half. In the previous year, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau cracked down on a major gambling case, arresting 17 gamblers on the spot, almost all of whom were individual operators. This group gambled over 30 times, with a total gambling amount of nearly 1 million yuan. Gambling and prostitution are also common illegal activities among individual operators.

Multi-faceted approach to rectify and guide

Facing the impact from individual households, relevant departments in Shanghai have taken a series of measures over the past few years, such as rectifying the order of individual economies, firmly cracking down on illegal activities like scalping scarce commodities, foreign exchange, national savings bonds, and various tickets; rectifying and shutting down the sale of pornographic and illegal publications and individual bars with "hostesses"; and launching anti-tax evasion campaigns, which have achieved certain results. Shanghai's relevant departments believe that, in accordance with the policy proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin at the 40th anniversary celebration, clear and corresponding policies for individual economies should be formulated. Economic, administrative, and legal means should be used to improve the management and education of individual households, guiding them onto a healthy development track.

Firstly, the state should strengthen macro-management and guidance of individual economies, including private economies, to play their positive roles while limiting their negative impacts on socialist economic development. This ensures the protection of legal operations and the elimination of illegal ones. Relevant regulations should be improved, and legal governance should be insisted upon. At the same time, there should be clear industry guidance for individual operations, with clear restrictions on the scope and methods of operation. Strict control and management should be implemented for special industries like bars.

Strengthen the leading role of state-owned and collective economies. Fully leverage the inherent advantages of state-owned and collective commerce. At the same time, the supplementary role of individual economies should be utilized, and classified price management for individual households should be strengthened to firmly curb and crack down on the bad business practices of "sky-high pricing."

Enhance the "business consciousness" of individual households and correctly guide consumption directions. The money earned by individual households, due to the lack of investment outlets, remains in the consumption sector, leading to a series of abnormal social phenomena. To correctly guide the consumption direction of individual households, compulsory old-age insurance can be implemented to ensure the old-age care of individual households and their employed laborers. When conditions are ripe, this can be further expanded to medical insurance. For large individual operators, their "business consciousness" should be enhanced, guiding them to transform into private enterprises and invest the increased funds into production development.

The state should have a unified comprehensive management agency for individual economies. For a long time, relevant departments such as industry and commerce administration, taxation, and public security have been like "railway police, each managing a section," leading to management fragmentation, lack of coordination, and even conflicts. Therefore, a comprehensive management department for individual households should be established to manage and educate individual households under unified policies and regulations.

Strengthen anti-corruption education among state functionaries and employees of state-owned and collective enterprises and institutions, and persistently carry out anti-corruption and anti-bribery campaigns. Recently, the Shanghai Taxation Bureau implemented a policy of regular rotation of tax officials and separation of collection and inspection duties, which has effectively addressed the issue of "using taxes for personal gain."

    正视来自个体户的冲击
    ——上海提出的问题及相应对策
    新华社记者　陈毛弟　严卫民
    上海个体经济这几年发展很快。至今年上半年止，全市有证个体工商户达108847户，从业人员有16万多人，分别比1978年增加13倍和20倍。注册资金3亿余元，商品零售额近7亿元。个体经济在社会经济生活中的积极作用是应该肯定的，对扩大劳动就业门路，促进流通，方便城乡居民生活，增加国家财政收入都是有利的。但个体户中存在的收入高、贿赂干部、不法经营和偷漏国税等现象，对整个社会带来经济上、心理上和道德上的冲击和腐蚀。上海市有关部门认为，必须加强个体经济管理，使之纳入健康发展轨道。
    以贿开道，动摇“军心”
    个体户中的一些不法分子把行贿作为发财致富的法宝。上海市检察机关的材料表明，个体户行贿案呈急剧上升趋势。某区检察院在调查一批受贿案时，传讯了100多个个体经营者，竟发现他们中几乎都有行贿的行为。不法个体户行贿的目标主要有两类：一部分握有“生杀予夺”管理权的人和握有物资分配、供应权的人。以此换到紧俏货源和谋取暴利。杨浦区检察院今年7、8月间从上海水产第一、第三批发部、上海鱼品加工厂、中国水产联合总公司上海分公司破获50余起受贿案，其中万元以上的大案15件，2万元以上的特大案3件。行贿者绝大多数是个体户。国家公务人员被不法个体户拉下水的主要是税务、工商、公安人员。
    上海市税务系统近年来已查处的税务人员违法案件中，有不少是由于不法个体经营者行贿所致。
    个体户收入与一般职工收入上的巨大反差，是社会分配不公的主要标志之一。个体户的高收入和高收入得之容易，使少数在职职工、机关干部“倒戈”，加入个体户大军。卢湾区4000个体从业人员中，辞退职人员有985人，约占1／4。一年里，个体户中辞退职人员所占比例上升了20％以上。还有更多的在职职工“日公夜私”，无照经营，工余时间卖牛奶，修自行车；或当个体户的帮工。
    赚违法钱，干违法事
    一些不法个体户赚违法钱，干违法事，有人形容他们是赚得疯狂，花得也疯狂。这种疯狂，对国家法纪、道德伦常乃至整个社会风气，都是强烈的冲击。
    “发大财，偷国税”，是一部分不法个体户发迹暴富的捷径。据上海市税务局资料表明，个体户的偷漏税面约占70％。数额一般几千元，多的上升到几万元乃至十几万元、几十万元。按照目前的税收法规照章交税，一个个体户要想暴富几乎是不可能的。就连一些个体户自己也承认，不偷税漏税，难以暴富。
    今年7、8月份，上海检察、税务部门就侦破了22件5万元以上的个体经营者特大偷税犯罪案。偷税数额共达276万元。个体户偷漏税的手法很多，有关部门调查归纳为7大类60种。
    乱涨价是个体经营中的一大问题。据上海物价检查部门反映，上海11万个体户中，大多数程度不同地存在着违反物价政策的情况。一些“狮子大开口”的个体出租车更是成了上海的一大公害。上海公共客运管理部门曾在两个月中查实个体出租车违纪营业168起，其中绝大多数属于乱收费、多收费的。另外，缺斤少两、掺假使杂等变相涨价现象更是普遍存在。
    由于个体经营者这个阶层素质偏低，在高额收入的催化下，一部分个体户就用违法赚来的钱，又去干违法的事。据上海市公安局统计，1987年全市有306个个体户受到劳动教养的处罚，其中因赌博而受此处罚的达55％以上。今年头4个月，又有110个个体户被送劳动教养，其中赌博的58人，也占一半以上。前年，上海市公安局破获一件特大赌博案，当场抓获赌徒17名，几乎全是个体经营者。这伙人聚赌30多次，赌资共计近百万元。流氓嫖宿，也是个体经营者中常有的违法犯罪现象。
    多管齐下，祛邪扶正
    面对来自个体户的冲击，上海有关部门几年来采取了一系列措施，如整顿个体经济秩序，坚决取缔倒卖紧俏商品、外币、国库券及各种票证等非法活动；整顿取缔黄色、非法书刊销售和个体酒吧“陪酒女郎”；开展反偷漏税工作等，已取得一定成效。上海市有关部门认为，要根据江泽民同志在国庆40周年大会讲话中提出的方针，制订明确配套的个体经济政策，运用经济的、行政的、法律的手段，完善对个体户的管理和教育，使之纳入健康发展的轨道。
    首先，国家对个体经济包括私营经济的发展，在宏观上加强管理和引导，既发挥他们的积极作用，又限制其不利于社会主义经济发展的消极作用，以切实做到保护合法经营，取缔非法经营。完善有关法规，坚持以法治理。同时，对个体经营要有明确的行业导向，经营范围和方式有明确的限制。对酒吧等特种行业要从严控制，严格管理。
    强化国营、集体经济的主导作用。充分发挥国营、集体商业的固有优势。同时，还要发挥个体经济的补充作用，加强对个体户的分类价格管理，坚决抑制和打击“漫天要价”的不良经商作风。
    提高个体户的“事业意识”，正确引导消费投向。个体户所赚到的钱，因在投资领域找不到出路，而滞留在消费领域，从而产生一系列不正常的社会现象。为正确引导个体户的消费投向，可实行强制养老保险，保障个体户和被他们雇佣的劳动者的养老问题。待时间和条件成熟后，进一步扩大到医疗保险。对个体经营大户应提高他们的“事业意识”，引导他们向私营企业转化，将增值的资金投入发展生产。
    国家对个体经济要有一个统一的综合管理机构。长期以来，工商行政、税收、公安等有关部门，犹如“铁路警察，各管一段”，造成管理上的脱节，不协调，甚至发生冲撞。因此，必须建立一个对个体户的综合管理部门，在统一的政策、法规指导下，担负管理、教育个体户的职责。
    在国家公务人员和国营、集体企事业干部中大力加强廉政教育，持久地开展反贪污、反受贿斗争。上海市税务局于最近推行税务干部定期换岗和征收、检查分离制，克服“以税谋私”弊病，已取得积极效果。
