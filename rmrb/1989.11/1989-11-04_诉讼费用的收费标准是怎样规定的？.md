    How are court fees standardized for civil, economic, maritime, and administrative lawsuits?

    When parties engage in civil, economic, maritime, and administrative litigation, what are the standards for court fees?

    The Supreme People's Court established the court litigation fee regulations in June.

    Case acceptance fee standards:

    (1) For divorce cases, each case requires a payment of 10 to 50 yuan. If property division is involved, no additional fees are charged if the total property value does not exceed 10,000 yuan; for amounts exceeding 10,000 yuan, 1% of the excess amount is charged.

    (2) For cases involving infringement of name rights, title rights, portrait rights, reputation rights, and honor rights, each case requires a payment of 50 to 100 yuan.

    (3) For other non-property cases, each case requires a payment of 10 to 50 yuan.

    (4) For property cases, fees are charged based on the disputed amount or value:
    - For amounts less than 1,000 yuan, 50 yuan per case.
    - For amounts exceeding 1,000 yuan up to 50,000 yuan, 4% of the excess amount.
    - For amounts exceeding 50,000 yuan up to 100,000 yuan, 3% of the excess amount.
    - For amounts exceeding 100,000 yuan up to 200,000 yuan, 2% of the excess amount.
    - For amounts exceeding 200,000 yuan up to 500,000 yuan, 1.5% of the excess amount.
    - For amounts exceeding 500,000 yuan up to 1,000,000 yuan, 1% of the excess amount.
    - For amounts exceeding 1,000,000 yuan, 0.5% of the excess amount.

    (5) For cases involving infringement of patent rights, copyrights, and trademark rights, each case requires a payment of 50 to 100 yuan; if there is a disputed amount, the fees are charged according to the property case standards.

    (6) For administrative cases, the standards are as follows:
    - For public order administrative cases, 5 to 30 yuan per case.
    - For patent administrative cases, 50 to 400 yuan per case.
    - For other administrative cases, 30 to 100 yuan per case. If there is a disputed amount, the fees are charged according to the property case standards.

    (7) For labor dispute cases, each case requires a payment of 30 to 50 yuan.

    (8) For bankruptcy cases, the fees are calculated based on the total assets of the bankrupt enterprise, according to the property case standards.

    Fees for applications such as enforcement:

    (1) For enforcement cases, if the enforcement amount or value is less than 100,000 yuan, 50 yuan per case; for amounts exceeding 100,000 yuan up to 500,000 yuan, 0.5% of the excess amount; for amounts exceeding 500,000 yuan, 0.1% of the excess amount.

    (2) For applications for litigation preservation measures, if the preserved property amount or value is less than 1,000 yuan, 30 yuan per case; for amounts exceeding 1,000 yuan up to 100,000 yuan, 1% of the excess amount; for amounts exceeding 100,000 yuan, 0.5% of the excess amount.

    (3) For maritime and commercial cases, the fees are as follows:
    - For applications to detain a vessel, 1,000 to 5,000 yuan per case.
    - For applications to register a debt, 500 yuan per case.
    - For applications to detain goods or fuel, 500 yuan per case.
    - For applications for limitation of maritime liability, 0.1% of the applied limitation amount, with a minimum of 500 yuan.

    Other fee standards:

    Inspection fees, appraisal fees, announcement fees, and translation fees are calculated according to the relevant department's fee standards.

    If the plaintiff raises two or more litigation requests, the defendant raises a counterclaim, or a third party raises a related litigation request, the court will calculate and collect the case acceptance fees separately based on the different litigation requests of each party.

    For property cases, if the amount applied by the party differs from the amount determined by the court, the fees will be calculated based on the actual disputed amount determined by the court after the case is concluded.

    According to legal provisions, the party should also pay other litigation fees, which refer to the actual expenses incurred and borne by the party during the court's trial and enforcement of property cases. These mainly include appraisal fees, inspection fees, witness compensation for lost wages and travel expenses, announcement fees, litigation material copy fees, other fees, and fees that the court deems should be paid by the party.
