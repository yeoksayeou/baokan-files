It was still the same hall with a touch of the Minnan style, and the same time, 10 a.m. The background was still the same giant painting of the Sun Rock, and the tea table was still adorned with two pots of fresh flowers...

Everything in the reception scene seemed to be the same as usual, but today, the familiar surroundings gave people a different feeling from the past.

On November 13, 1989, Deng Xiaoping met with foreign guests in the Fujian Hall of the Great Hall of the People.

This was a historic moment.

Comrade Xiaoping, dressed in a dark gray Zhongshan suit, stood by the screen, looking radiant. He shook hands with each member of the visiting delegation from the Japan-China Economic Association. In front of dozens of Japanese guests and dozens of Chinese and foreign journalists, Comrade Xiaoping announced to them, and to China, and to the world: "The delegation from the Japan-China Economic Association will be the last official delegation I will receive. I would like to use this opportunity to formally bid farewell to my political career."

A few brief words, spoken as clearly and calmly as ever, yet the dozens of journalists present received an important message: Today, our beloved Comrade Xiaoping would formally bid farewell to his more than 60-year political career.

"Retirement means real retirement. This time, I will truly step down. I am stepping down to allow the leaders of the Party, the government, and the military to work with ease. I believe they can do a good job."

The reporters noticed that when Comrade Xiaoping said these words, his deep gaze revealed a firm and confident expression.

The entire meeting was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere. From Mr. Saito Eishiro's greeting to Comrade Xiaoping, "I am glad to see you in good health," to the final farewell when Mr. Saito held Comrade Xiaoping's hands tightly and said with deep emotion, "For the prosperity of China, for the prosperity of Asia, and for the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, I wish you good health and longevity!" The nearly 70-minute meeting seemed to pass in an instant.

In the past, after the meetings, the staff on site knew that Comrade Xiaoping's time was precious. Although everyone wanted to say a few words to him, no one dared to take up his time. However, today, several reporters who often covered Comrade Xiaoping's meetings with foreign guests could no longer hold back their admiration for him. They unanimously requested, "Comrade Deng, can we take a photo with you and the few Chinese reporters?" "Good! It will be more relaxed to take a photo with the reporters." Comrade Xiaoping agreed so readily, which caused a burst of laughter. Even a few staff members of the Great Hall of the People squeezed in, saying, "We also want to take a photo with Comrade Deng." Comrade Xiaoping happily fulfilled everyone's request.

Comrade Xiaoping bid farewell to his glorious political career, but people will never forget him...

    难忘的时刻
    ——小平同志会见最后一批外宾侧记
    本报记者　孙毅
    还是这间透着八闽风情的大厅，还是上午10点这一时刻，背景依然是那幅日光岩巨画，茶几上照例摆放着两盆鲜花……
    接见现场的一切似乎都和往常一样，但是今天这里熟悉的一切，却又给人以不同于过去的感觉。
    1989年11月13日，邓小平同志于人民大会堂福建厅会见外宾。
    这是一个历史性的时刻。
    小平同志身着深灰色中山装，站在屏风旁边，容光焕发，同来访的日中经济协会访华团的日本客人一一握手。当着几十位日本客人、几十位中外记者，小平同志向他们、也是向中国、向全世界宣布：“日中经济协会代表团将是我会见的最后一个正式的代表团，我想利用这个机会，正式向政治生涯告别。”
    短短几句话，像以往那样说得明快、平和，几十位在场的中外记者却由此得到一条重要信息：今天，敬爱的小平同志将正式告别他60多年的政治生涯。
    “退就要真退，这次我就要百分之百地退下来。我退下来，也是想让党、政府、军队的领导人能够放手工作。我相信他们能够把工作做好。”
    记者注意到，当小平同志说这句话时，深邃的目光中透露出的神情是坚定的，是自信的。
    整个会见充满亲切、友好的气氛。从斋藤英四郎先生向小平同志问候开始：“看到您满面红光我很高兴”，到最后道别时斋藤先生双手紧握小平同志的手，深情地说：“为了中国的繁荣、亚洲的繁荣，为了中日两国人民的友好情谊，希望您健康长寿！”近70分钟的会见，竟像一瞬间那么快地过去了。
    以往会见结束时，在场的工作人员深知小平同志时间宝贵，虽然都想和他说上几句话，但谁都不忍心去占用他的时间。然而今天，几位经常采访小平同志会见外宾的记者再也按捺不住对小平同志的崇敬之情，异口同声地请求：“邓主席，与我们这几位中国记者合个影吧！”“好！和记者们合影要轻松多了。”小平同志答应得这么痛快，引起一片欢笑，连几位大会堂工作人员也挤了过来，说：“我们也要和邓主席合个影。”小平同志愉快地满足了大家的要求。
    小平同志告别了他光辉的政治生涯，但人们永远不会忘记他……
