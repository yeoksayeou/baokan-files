The German Democratic Republic's Socialist Unity Party's action program emphasizes that Marxism-Leninism is now and will remain the worldview of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

The program, when discussing political reforms in the German Democratic Republic, points out that by reforming the current electoral system and drafting new election laws, "free, universal, democratic, and secret elections" will be ensured, thereby guaranteeing the formation of a People's Chamber and local people's representative bodies that truly represent the people's interests. It is necessary to fully guarantee the rights of people's representative bodies at all levels to represent the people's interests.

The program emphasizes the need for comprehensive economic reform and points out that the German Democratic Republic will combine economic reform with changes in current economic policies to better promote economic development and improve the people's living standards. The German Democratic Republic will strive to establish a "planned economic system that can adapt to market conditions."

The program believes that the reform of the Socialist Unity Party itself and the rebuilding of the people's trust in the party through self-reform, as well as strengthening the party's ability to act, are of great significance to socialist reform. The program points out that the principle of separating party and government will also be implemented in the German Democratic Republic in the future.

The action program emphasizes that the achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in the 40 years since its founding, including the worker-peasant alliance, the democratic forces, public ownership of the means of production, the planned economy, and the alliance with the Soviet Union and other fraternal socialist countries, are the prerequisites for further strengthening socialism through reform.

The 10th plenary session of the 11th Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, held today, announced that Mietag, who was previously in charge of economic work, and Hermann, who was previously in charge of propaganda, were both expelled from the Central Committee after being removed from their positions as members of the Political Bureau at the 9th plenary session held on October 18.

    德国统一社会党行动纲领强调
    坚持马列主义世界观
    新华社柏林11月10日电  德通社今天播发的德国统一社会党行动纲领强调指出，马克思列宁主义现在是、将来也仍是德国统一社会党的世界观。
    纲领在谈到民主德国将进行的政治改革时指出，通过改革现行选举制度，制订新的选举法，来保证实行“自由、普遍、民主和秘密的选举”，从而保证产生能代表人民权益的人民议院和地方人民代表机构。要充分保证各级人民代表机构行使它们的代表人民利益的权利。
    纲领强调要实行全面经济改革并指出，民主德国将结合经济改革来改变现行经济政策，使之能更好地促进经济发展、有益于人民生活水平的提高。民主德国将为建立一种“能适应市场条件的计划经济体制”而努力。
    纲领认为，德国统一社会党自身的改革以及通过自身改革来重建人民对党的信任，加强党的行动能力，对社会主义改革具有重大意义。纲领指出，今后在民主德国也要实行党政分开的原则。
    行动纲领强调指出，民主德国建国40年来所取得的成就，工农政权，民主力量结成的同盟，生产资料的公有制，计划经济，以及同苏联和其它兄弟社会主义国家之间的结盟，是民主德国通过改革进一步加强社会主义的前提。
    今天发表的德国统一社会党11届10中全会公报说，在10月18日召开的9中全会上被解除政治局委员职务的原主管经济工作的米塔格和主管新闻宣传的赫尔曼，这次又被开除出中央委员会。
