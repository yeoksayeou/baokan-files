A financial and tax inspection report from Shanghai revealed that the Shanghai Gelatin Factory, with only 200 employees, initially reported 19,700 yuan in violations during a self-inspection. However, a focused inspection uncovered numerous issues, including 80,000 yuan in unpaid stamp taxes, additional consulting fees, inflated costs, and nearly 80,000 yuan in overcharged fees that are still under investigation.

The discovery of such significant issues in a small factory shocked Shanghai's financial and tax officials. Shanghai alone has tens of thousands of similar small factories with dozens to a hundred employees. These small factories can contribute significantly to national revenue, but they also have many loopholes.

It is understood that many small factories like the Shanghai Gelatin Factory have had various issues in their economic activities over the past few years, with some problems being quite severe. However, since the financial and tax inspections began in 1985, there has been a tendency to focus on large enterprises while neglecting small ones. This time, Shanghai's financial and tax departments have learned from past experiences and have conducted inspections on both large and small enterprises, achieving noticeable results.

Relevant departments have called for attention to the numerous small factories and shops across the country. They should not be overlooked just because they are small.

### 财税大检查勿漏小企业

    财税大检查勿漏小企业
    新华社记者　汪洪洋
    上海的一份财税大检查简报说，只有200人的上海明胶厂，前一阶段自查申报违纪金额1.97万元，但是一经重点检查发现问题不少，仅今年1至9月就漏交印花税，额外收取咨询费、多计成本等8万多元，还有近8万元的加价收费正在查实。
    小小一洞，风大如此，使上海财税人员吃了一惊。几十人、百把人的小厂，上海少说有上万个。这些小厂可为国家增收很大一笔财源，但漏洞也很大。
    据了解，不少像明胶厂这类小厂，在近年的经济活动中或多或少都有一些毛病，有的问题还很大。但是从1985年开展财税、物价大检查以来，一直存在“查大不查小”的现象。上海财税部门这次吸取了过去的教训，在检查中既抓大又抓小，取得了明显效果。
    有关部门呼吁，对全国多如繁星的小厂小店，切莫因厂小店小而不查。
