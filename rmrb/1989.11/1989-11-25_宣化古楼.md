The ancient towers of Xuanhua, specifically the Nanmen Tower, Zhenshuo Tower, and Qingyuan Tower, are located along the south-north axis of Xuanhua City. People often say: when autumn comes to Xuanhua, enjoy the grapes and admire the ancient sites. Among these sites, the three towers are the most prominent.

First, let's look at the Nanmen Tower. This tower is tall and majestic. Standing on the city wall, one can see the entire panorama of ancient Xuanhua City. The tower spans seven bays in width and three bays in depth, with a double-eaved, hip-and-gable roof in the small-scale style of the Qing Dynasty. Although it is a city gate tower, its grandeur and architectural value can rival those of the Zhenshuo Tower and Qingyuan Tower.

Traveling north for about five hundred meters, one arrives at the Zhenshuo Tower. This tower was built in the fifth year of the Zhengtong reign of the Ming Dynasty (1440). The tower stands on a platform that is 4.8 meters high. The tower itself is 15 meters tall, spans seven bays in width and five bays in depth, with a double-eaved, hip-and-gable roof. The plaque on the south side of the tower, bearing the name "Zhenshuo Tower," was made in the sixth year of the Qianlong reign of the Qing Dynasty. The plaque on the north side, reading "God's Capital Screen," was inscribed by the Qianlong Emperor himself. The large wooden components of the Zhenshuo Tower are well-preserved, fully displaying its original appearance.

Continuing north for another two hundred meters, one reaches the Qingyuan Tower. This tower was built in the eighteenth year of the Chenghua reign of the Ming Dynasty (1482). Although it was reconstructed during the Qing Dynasty, the wooden components still retain the characteristics of Ming Dynasty architecture. The tower is 17 meters tall, spans five bays in width and three bays in depth, with triple eaves and a hip-and-gable roof. The four sides of the tower feature protruding wings, and there is a surrounding corridor, giving the tower a cross-shaped plan. Each of the four sides of the tower has a plaque. Inside the tower hangs a bronze bell cast during the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty. The bell's sound is resonant and can be heard clearly from forty li away.

　　宣化古楼
　　崔连玉
    宣化古楼，即南门楼、镇朔楼和清远楼，坐落在宣化城中心的南北轴线上。人们常说：秋到宣化品葡萄，品着葡萄看古迹，这些古迹中首推三楼。
    先看南门楼。此楼高大雄伟，站在城楼古城宣化全景尽收眼底。城楼面阔七间，进深三间，重檐歇山式布瓦顶，系清代小式做法。它虽是座城门楼，但气势、建筑价值均可与镇朔楼、清远楼媲美。
    向北行五百米，便是镇朔楼。此楼建于明正统五年（一四四○年），楼体落座在四点八米高的墩台上，楼高十五米，面阔七间，进深五间，重檐歇山式布瓦顶。楼南面悬“镇朔楼”匾为清乾隆六年制，北面“神京屏翰”匾额为清乾隆皇帝所题。镇朔楼大木构件保存完整，充分显示出它的原有面貌。
    再向北行二百米，就到清远楼了。此楼建于明成化十八年（一四八二年），虽经清代重修，但木构件基本保持了明代建筑特点。楼高十七米，面阔五间，进深三间，三重檐、歇山顶。楼的四面皆出抱厦，周有游廓，平面呈“十”字形。楼上四面悬有匾额。楼内悬挂明嘉靖年间铸造的铜钟一口，钟声宏亮，四十里外清晰可闻。
