Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 27th.

The preliminary results of the ninth Indian Lok Sabha (lower house) elections announced this evening indicate that no single party has secured a majority of the 545 seats, meaning the next Indian government will be a coalition.

In the 352 seats announced so far, the ruling Congress Party (Indira faction) has won 150 seats, the National Front, a coalition of five parties, has secured 73 seats, and the Bharatiya Janata Party has won 71 seats.

The Congress Party has been in power for approximately 40 of the 42 years since India's independence. In the previous elections, it achieved a landslide victory. However, in this election, it has lost its ability to form a government on its own. Whether the Congress Party can form a government with other parties will depend on the outcome of their negotiations. The Bharatiya Janata Party has stated that it will not form a government with the Congress Party (Indira faction).

Indian President Venkataraman accepted the cabinet's recommendation last night to dissolve the eighth Lok Sabha ahead of schedule.

As of the time of writing, out of the 524 seats announced, the Congress Party (Indira faction) has won 172.

　　印大选无一党获过半数议席
　　下届政府将成为多党联合体
    新华社新德里11月27日电　今晚宣布的第九届印度人民院（下院）大选的初步结果表明，无一政党能获得人民院545个议席中过半数的议席，因此，下届印政府将为多党联合体。
    在已公布的352个议席中，执政的国大党（英迪拉派）获得150个席位，由5个党联合的全国阵线获73个席位，印度人民党获71个席位。
    国大党在印度独立42年来执政约40年，上届大选中，它获得压倒多数的胜利。而在本届大选中它失去了单独组阁的资格。国大党是否能与其他党联合组成政府，还要看它们之间协商情况如何。印人民党表示不同国大党（英）一起执政。
    据新华社新德里11月28日电　印度总统文卡塔拉曼昨晚在此间接受内阁建议，决定提前解散第8届人民院。
    到发稿时为止，从已揭晓的人民院524席中424席的情况看，国大党（英）只获172席。
