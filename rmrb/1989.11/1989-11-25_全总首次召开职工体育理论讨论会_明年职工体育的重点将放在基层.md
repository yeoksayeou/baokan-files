The All-China Federation of Trade Unions held its first conference on workers' sports theory. The focus of workers' sports in the coming year will be at the grassroots level.

	According to a report by reporter Liu Xiaoming, "If everyone pays attention to the development of workers' sports, the country's enterprises could reduce 2.8 billion yuan in production losses annually." This figure was presented by a representative from the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions at the national conference on workers' sports theory, which concluded on November 24. This figure is equivalent to 2.5 times the current national sports budget.

	The Beijing Institute of Physical Education and other units conducted a sample survey of several enterprises that actively promote group activities and those that do not pay attention to workers' sports. After comparing and calculating aspects such as employee attendance rates and medical expenses, they arrived at the above estimate. Many participants at the conference pointed out that the significance of promoting workers' sports is not just economic. It also plays a positive role in improving the quality of workers, enhancing the cohesion of enterprises, and conducting ideological and political work.

	More than 80 trade union sports officials from various regions gathered in Langfang, Hebei, to participate in this conference, which was the first of its kind held by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The conference discussed how to open up new prospects for workers' sports work in the new situation, how to ensure workers' sports in terms of organizational structure, activity funds, and personnel allocation through sports legislation, and how to understand the issues of enterprises running sports teams and the socialization of sports. The discussion on the last issue was particularly heated. Some representatives said that currently, many enterprises run sports teams by purchasing retired athletes, spending a lot of money but not promoting the development of workers' sports, which squeezes workers' interests and is not popular among workers. Recently, the Huochetou Football Team and the Coal Mining Women's Basketball Team entered the first division. Logically, the workers in their respective systems should feel happy and proud, but the response was not enthusiastic. Some workers even felt that these were not their teams. This shows that the development of enterprise teams is indeed worth serious consideration.

	At the conference, a relevant responsible person from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions introduced the plans for workers' sports work in the coming year, stating that the focus of workers' sports in the coming year will be at the grassroots level, facing the masses of workers, such as organizing a million workers' winter long-distance running activity. It is understood that in the next few years, no large-scale comprehensive national workers' sports meetings will be held.

### 全总首次召开职工体育理论讨论会　明年职工体育的重点将放在基层

　　全总首次召开职工体育理论讨论会
　　明年职工体育的重点将放在基层
    本报讯　记者刘小明报道：“如果大家都重视起职工体育的开展，仅全国的企业一年就可以减少28亿元的产值损失。”这是在11月24日闭幕的全国职工体育理论研讨会上，来自上海市总工会的代表提出的令人感兴趣的数字。这个数字相当于目前全国体育经费的两倍半。
    北京体院等单位对一批开展群体活动好的企业和不重视职工体育的企业进行的抽样调查，经过对职工出勤率和医疗费等方面对比计算，也得出上述估算的数字。许多参加研讨会的同志指出，实际上，开展职工体育的意义不仅仅在经济上，它对于提高职工的素质，增强企业的凝聚力，搞好思想政治工作，都有着积极的作用。
    各地80多位工会体育干部聚集河北廊坊，参加了由全国总工会首次召开的这个研讨会。会上就在新形势下如何开创职工体育工作的新局面，怎样从体育立法上对职工体育在组织机构、活动经费、人员编制等方面予以保证，怎样认识企业办运动队及体育社会化的问题进行了讨论。对于最后一个问题讨论尤其热烈。有的代表说，现在不少企业办运动队的作法是买退役的运动员，花钱不少，对职工体育开展却没什么促进，挤占了职工利益，不受职工欢迎。最近，火车头足球队、煤矿女篮等打入甲级队，按理说本系统职工应该感到高兴自豪，然而反响并不热烈，有的职工甚至认为这不是自己的队。由此可见，企业办队究竟怎样发展很值得好好思考。
    全国总工会有关负责人在会上介绍明年职工体育工作的打算时说，明年职工体育的重点将放在基层，面向职工群众，如组织百万职工冬季长跑活动等。据悉，近几年内将不举办大规模综合性的全国工人运动会。
