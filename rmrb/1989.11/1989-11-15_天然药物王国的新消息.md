The green digits flash on the computer screen. The recently compiled national survey data on Chinese medicinal resources has delighted the pharmacologists present—China's medicinal animals, plants, and minerals amount to over 10,000 species!

This survey result updates the historical record of 700 species in the "Ben Cao" and exceeds the number of medicinal types listed in the authoritative "Dictionary of Chinese Medicine" by 4,300.

The Legacy of Shen Nong

Time travels back thousands of years. Shen Nong, in the dense forests of western Hubei between the Yangtze and Han Rivers, "tasted the flavors of a hundred herbs and the sweetness and bitterness of springs, teaching people what to avoid and what to seek" ("Huainanzi"). Thus, the birth of medicine in the Chinese nation began.

In the 1980s, to promote the development of traditional Chinese medicine, 10,000 descendants of Shen Nong braved the elements for seven years, traversing the country to gather medicinal materials, and wrote a new chapter in the Chinese pharmacopoeia.

At the National Office for the Survey of Chinese Medicinal Resources in Beijing, Deputy Director Zhang Huiyuan told the reporter, "Since the publication of China's first pharmaceutical monograph, 'Shen Nong's Classic of Materia Medica,' there has been a tradition of compiling pharmacopoeias. The 'Shen Nong's Classic of Materia Medica,' compiled in the first century, included only 365 medicinals. After numerous revisions by later generations, the 'Compendium of Materia Medica' in the Ming Dynasty recorded 1,892 medicinals. It is through the unremitting efforts of generation after generation that the treasure trove of Chinese medicine has been continually enriched.

"We are engaged in the great cause of revising the pharmacopoeia in Chinese history, but our work scope has far exceeded that of the ancients." Zhang Huiyuan cited the example of Li Shizhen. This pharmacist, who traveled far and wide to gather medicines and compiled books by candlelight, devoted his life to the cause, but his footsteps were limited to Hubei and Anhui. This time, however, a national team of over 20,000 professionals was organized to conduct simultaneous surveys in 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. The data storage and processing used computers, and the scale of the work was unprecedented in any previous revision of the pharmacopoeia.

The pharmacy of Chinese herbs lies in the vast expanse of nature. To find the toad in the valley, the creeping fig on ancient trees, and the snow lotus by the ice cliff, even today, one must still climb mountains and cross ravines like the ancient Shen Nong. This makes the survey of medicinal resources both interesting and fraught with danger.

The elderly pharmacist Cao Zhenyu from Tianjin has traveled to Tibet nine times, crossed the main peak of the Zilajia Snow Mountain, and ridden horses through the heart of the Qaidam Grassland to unravel the mystery of Tibetan medicines, learning to eat raw meat, knead tsampa, and speak Tibetan.

The Sichuan survey team visited 14,152 villages in the mountains and rivers, holding nearly 10,000 consultation meetings just to learn from the "living pharmacopoeia" among the local people.

The Mysterious Red-Billed Crow

In the summer of 1989, the seven-year field investigation work came to an end. Experts involved in the national data research and compilation gathered in Beijing. Faced with 100,000 specimens of medicinal plants and animals and 1,600 volumes of reports on new discoveries, the pharmacologists felt "a bit dizzy and bewildered."

In the legendary Shen Nongjia forest area, there is a vine-like wild grass that grows all over the mountains, known locally as "May 5th," which has long been used as pig feed. During the survey, it was discovered that this was the famous "glossy ganoderma."

Glossy ganoderma is bitter and prefers shade, and its appearance is not impressive. However, modern pharmacology has proven that it contains nearly 60 types of ginsenosides, with a total content even higher than ginseng. It has excellent effects on health and cancer prevention and has recently become highly valued in the international market, known as the "gospel grass" by the Japanese.

In this survey, reports from various places frequently brought good news: the provinces along the south bank of the Yangtze River all found rich deposits of glossy ganoderma. The Chinese botanical community exclaimed: "In the north, there is the Changbai ginseng, and in the south, there is the glossy ganoderma!"

Crows are generally black, but their beaks differ in color. A species of red-billed crow inhabiting the grasslands of Inner Mongolia is a secret contraceptive medicine known only to local herdsmen. This substance, if taken in large quantities, can lead to permanent sterility. However, if prepared according to the traditional Mongolian method, it prevents pregnancy for three days with no side effects. Its effectiveness surpasses chemical contraceptives. Wei Zongyu, a staff member of the Chinese Medicinal Materials Company who has been involved in medicinal materials work for many years, revealed to the reporter: "Such a miraculous natural contraceptive has never been found in China before!"

The red-billed crow contraceptive brought back to Beijing by the survey team is one of nearly 20,000 folk prescriptions and ancestral secret formulas collected this time. Soon to be published, "Chinese Folk Single Prescriptions" will save these precious experiences of treating diseases from being lost in the river of time.

It is believed that China has never before, in its history, consciously and systematically collected so many single prescriptions on a national scale.

The New Hotspot in Global Drug Development

It is said that Dr. Richard Schultes, the director of the Harvard University Botanical Museum, was once fascinated by the legendary "miracle plant." After spending 13 years in the Amazon rainforest, he predicted: "Future medicines will grow in the forest."

The implication of this statement by the renowned pharmacologist from across the ocean is profound. The earliest medicines of all human nations were directly collected from nature. Modern Western chemical medicines have only a brief history of a hundred years. However, recent reports of drug-induced diseases have repeatedly caused panic among modern people: taking aspirin can lead to fatal bone marrow poisoning; taking thalidomide resulted in thousands of seal babies being born with limb deformities. Medical statistics have recently listed the "ten drug disasters of the century," all caused by the toxic side effects of chemical drugs.

Thus, returning to nature has become a new hotspot in drug development for developed countries. People have finally realized: natural medicines, produced in the era of harmony between humans and nature, are more suitable for the regulation of the human body, just as the tranquil countryside is more in line with human nature than the noisy city.

China is the country with the richest resources of medicinal plants and animals; the Chinese nation has the richest experience in developing and utilizing natural medicines.

This time, in the new trend of global pharmaceutical research returning to nature, the Chinese people are at the forefront!

    天然药物王国的新消息
    新华社记者　夏林
    绿莹莹的数码在电脑屏幕上闪跳。刚刚统计出的全国中药资源普查汇总数据，使在场的药学家们大喜过望——我国药用动物、植物、矿物资源种类竟达一万余种！
    这一普查结果，刷新了历史上700种版本的本草记载，比当代权威性的《中药大辞典》所收药类还多4300种。
                  “神农”传人的事业
    时光上溯数千年。神农氏在江汉之间的鄂西原始莽林中，“尝百草之滋味，水泉之甘苦，令民知所避就”（《淮南子》），中华民族始有医药诞生。
    20世纪80年代，为使民族传统药学发扬光大，万名神农的传人又沐雨栉风，历时七载，遍访天下药材，续写了中华药典的新篇章。
    在北京的全国中药资源普查办公室，张惠源副主任告诉记者，自我国第一部药物专著《神农本草经》问世，自古有修本草的传统。成书于公元一世纪的《神农本草经》，收入药物仅365种。经后世多次重修，明代《本草纲目》记载的药材已达1892种。正是通过一代又一代人的不懈努力，对野外药源进行深入调查，才使中华药学宝库得到不断丰富。
    “我们从事的是中华民族历史上又一次重修本草的事业，但工作范畴又已远远超过了古人。”张惠源举出李时珍的例子。这位远游访药、秉烛修书的药圣，毕一生之精力，足迹也只局限于湖广、安徽等地，而这一次，则是由国家组建两万余人的专业队伍，在30个省、市、自治区同步展开普查，数据资料存贮和处理动用了计算机，投入力量之多，工作规模之大，是以往任何一次修本草的举动都无法比拟的。
    中草药的药库在广袤的大自然中。要寻找幽谷里的蛤蚧，古木上的凌霄，冰崖边的雪莲，即使在今天，也仍然要像上古的神农氏那样结绳为梯、攀山越涧。这就使药材资源普查饶有趣味又充满艰险。
    天津籍老药工曹振宇9进西藏，翻越色齐拉雪山主峰，策马羌塘草原腹地，为揭开高原藏药之谜学会了嚼生肉、捏糌粑，说藏话。
    四川普查队走遍巴山蜀水14152个村庄，仅为就教山民中的“活药典”，就召开过近万次访察座谈会。
                      神奇的红嘴乌鸦
    1989年仲夏。风尘七载的野外调查工作落下帷幕，参与全国资料研究编纂的众多专家汇集北京。面对100万份药用动植物标本、1600卷集纳考察新发现的汇报材料，生药学家的感受是“很有点儿目眩神迷”。
    在富有传奇色彩的神农架林区，有种遍山衍生的藤本野草，土名“5月5”，多年被当作喂猪草。普查中方发现，这竟是大名鼎鼎的绞股蓝。
    绞股蓝味苦喜荫，其貌不扬，但现代生药化学检测证明，它含有近60种人参皂甙，总含量甚至高于人参，健体防癌效果极佳，在国际市场上近来身价百倍，被日本人称为“福音草”。
    在这次普查中，各地报来的考察报告频传佳音：长江南岸各省都找到了绞股蓝丰富蕴藏。中国植物学界惊叹：“北有长白参，南有绞股蓝！”
    天下乌鸦一般黑，但嘴的颜色有所不同。内蒙古草原上栖居的一种红嘴乌鸦，是当地牧人秘而不宣的避孕神药。此物多服会导致终身绝育，但只要按照蒙族世传的方法配制，服后三日，绝无受孕之虞，三日之后，亦无任何副作用，效果胜过化学避孕药。中国药材公司多年从事药材工作的生产处干部魏宗玉向记者披露：“国内过去还从没找见过这样神奇的天然避孕药！”
    普查人员带回北京的红嘴乌鸦避孕药，是这次搜集到的近2万份民间验方和祖传秘方中的一个。不久面世的《中国民间单验方》，将挽救这些治病救人的宝贵经验不致在岁月之河中湮没。
    据信，中国历代还从未曾像这次一样，在全国范围内有意识、有组织地征集这样多的单方。
            世界药物开发的新热点
    据说，美国哈佛大学植物馆馆长理查德·舒尔特斯博士曾醉心于采集传说中的植物“神药”。他在亚马孙丛林中度过了13年后预言：“将来的药材生长在森林中。”
    这位大洋彼岸的知名药用植物学者的断言涵意深蕴。人类各民族最初的药物，都是直接从大自然中采集的，近代西方化学药物，只有短暂的百年发展史。但近年来药源性疾病的频繁报道，一再引起现代人的恐慌，服用安基比林带来致命的骨髓中毒；服用反应造成成千上万的海豹肢畸形婴儿出生。医学界新近统计了“本世纪十次药物性灾难”，都是由化学药品的毒副作用引起的。
    于是，重返大自然成了发达国家药物开发的新热点。人们方才颖悟：产生于人类与大自然和谐相处时代的天然药物，更适合人体的调节，就有如宁谧的原野比嘈杂的都市更符合人的天性一样。
    中国是药用动植物资源最丰富的国度；
    中华民族是开发利用天然药物经验最丰富的民族。
    这一次，在世界药学研究回归自然的新潮中，中国人站在了潮头！
