At the recently concluded Third World Women's Weightlifting Championship, Chinese women weightlifters won first place in the total score for 8 out of 9 weight classes. Out of the 27 gold medals in total, China secured 24. This follows the 26 gold medals won at the 1988 championship, marking another significant achievement for Chinese women's weightlifting. In the realm of Chinese sports, few projects have such a dominant position in the world.

Women's weightlifting began in the United States in the early 1980s and has developed rapidly over the past nine years. This championship saw participation from 26 countries with over 140 athletes, and three countries sent observers. During the competition, world records were broken in every weight class, with some being rewritten multiple times.

The Chinese women's weightlifting team, established in 1985, has in just five years created a rigorous management system and effective training methods, consistently achieving excellent results and demonstrating the promising future of this sport.

Based on the current situation, China's women's weightlifting is expected to maintain its leading position in the world, particularly in the lighter weight classes, for the next few years. However, it would be unwise to be overly optimistic about how long this advantage can be sustained.

It is understood that the International Weightlifting Federation is lobbying to include women's weightlifting in the 1996 Olympics. The realization of this plan seems to be just a matter of time. Once included, the allure of several dozen medals will be evident. Many countries will undoubtedly invest more effort into this sport. At that point, China's current advantages will face significant challenges. From this championship, it is clear that China has already faced strong competition from European and American athletes in several heavier weight classes.

Some experts in the weightlifting community point out that regarding China's women's weightlifting, we must not only focus on the present but also look towards the future. We should include women's weightlifting as part of China's overall competitive sports strategy. Only in this way can we ensure that this sport maintains its global advantage for the long term.

### 着眼未来保持优势——第三届世界女子举重锦标赛述评

　　着眼未来保持优势
　　——第三届世界女子举重锦标赛述评
    在刚刚结束的第三届世界女子举重锦标赛上，中国女子举重选手夺得9个级别中的8个总成绩第一。在总共27枚金牌中，中国获得24枚。这是继1988年上届锦标赛夺得26枚金牌后，我国女子举重运动取得的又一次大面积丰收。在我国的体育项目中，能够在世界上占有如此优势的恐怕不多。
    世界女子举重80年代初始自美国，近9年来发展很快。本次锦标赛就有26个国家的140余名选手参加，还有3个国家派了观察员。比赛中每个级别的世界纪录都被刷新，有的被改写了几次。
    中国女子举重队自1985年开始的短短5年时间内，已经建立起了一套严格的管理制度和行之有效的训练手段，并不断取得好成绩，显示出这一项目方兴未艾的好势头。
    根据目前情况，在未来的几年内，中国女子举重仍可在世界上占领先地位，尤其是轻级别项目。但是，这种优势究竟能够保持多久，却不可盲目乐观。
    据了解，国际举重联合会已经在游说，力争把女子举重列入1996年奥运会。这一计划的实现看来只是时间早晚的问题。一旦列入奥运会，几十枚奖牌的吸引力是显而易见的。许多国家肯定会花比现在更大的力气抓这一项目。到那时候，中国目前具备的优势将会受到冲击。从本届锦标赛来看，我国已经在几个重级别中受到欧美强手的有力挑战。
    一些举重界人士指出，对我国女子举重的状况，不仅要看到现在，更要着眼于未来。要把女子举重作为我国竞技体育总体战略的一部分提上日程，只有这样，才能使这一项目长久地在世界上保持优势。
