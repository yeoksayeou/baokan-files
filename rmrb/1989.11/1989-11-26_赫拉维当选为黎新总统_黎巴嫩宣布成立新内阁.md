59-year-old Lebanese parliamentarian Elias Hrawi was elected as the new president today in the Lebanese parliamentary election.

The Lebanese parliamentary election, presided over by Speaker Hussein, was held this evening in the Lebanese Bekaa region's Shatoura. Among the 53 parliamentarians who participated in the election, Hrawi was elected as the Lebanese president with 47 votes, succeeding President Muawad, who was killed in an explosion two days ago.

Syrian President Assad sent a congratulatory message to Hrawi on his election as the Lebanese president, hoping that under his leadership, Lebanon would achieve national reconciliation.

The body of the late President Muawad was flown to his hometown in northern Lebanon this morning. Muawad's funeral will be held there tomorrow noon.

	BEIRUT, November 25 (Xinhua) -- According to reports from Shatoura, Lebanon, the Lebanese national unity government was announced to have been formed early today.

	The new government consists of 14 ministers, with 7 each from the Muslim and Christian sects. Sunni Muslim Salim Hoss was appointed as the Prime Minister and concurrently the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Jumblatt, the leader of the Druze Muslim sect, who has close ties with Syria, and Berri, the leader of the Shia Muslim sect, were appointed as the Minister of Public Works and the Minister of Energy, Electricity, and Housing Cooperation, respectively. The cabinet list also includes Maronite Christian parliamentarian and Phalange Party leader George Saadah. It is reported that Saadah did not participate in last night's presidential election. He had stated that he had no intention of joining the new government, but he did not oppose the new government.

	This is the third time a cabinet has been formed since the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war in 1975. Hoss was authorized to form the cabinet on November 13 and had multiple consultations with various Lebanese sects.

	Due to the opposition of Lebanese military leader Aoun, the Lebanese government had not been formed until President Muawad was assassinated on November 22. Just a few hours after the Lebanese parliament elected Hrawi as the president last night, the new Lebanese government was announced, which led to an unexpected and rapid change in the Lebanese situation.

　　赫拉维当选为黎新总统
　　黎巴嫩宣布成立新内阁
    本报大马士革11月24日电　记者吕志星报道：59岁的黎巴嫩议员伊莱亚斯·赫拉维今天在黎巴嫩议会选举中当选为新总统。
    由议长侯赛尼主持的黎巴嫩议会选举今晚在黎巴嫩贝卡地区的什陶拉市举行。在参加选举的53名议员中，赫拉维以47票当选为黎巴嫩总统，接替两天前因爆炸事件而遇难的穆阿瓦德总统的工作。
    叙利亚总统阿萨德电贺赫拉维当选为黎巴嫩总统，希望在他的领导下，黎巴嫩实现全国和解。
    已故总统穆阿瓦德的遗体已于今日上午由专机运往黎巴嫩北部他的家乡，穆阿瓦德的葬礼将于明日中午在那里举行。
    本报大马士革11月25日电记者吕志星报道：据来自黎巴嫩什陶拉的消息，今天凌晨，黎巴嫩全国统一政府宣布成立。
    新政府由14名部长组成，其中穆斯林教派和基督教派各占7名。逊尼派穆斯林萨利姆·胡斯任总理兼外交部长。同叙利亚关系密切的穆斯林德鲁兹派领导人琼卜拉特和穆斯林什叶派领导人贝里分别担任政府的公共事务部长和能源、电力和住房合作部长。内阁名单中还包括基督教马龙派议员、长枪党领导人乔治·萨达赫。据报道，萨达赫没有参加昨天晚上的总统选举，他曾表示，他无意参加新政府，但也不反对新政府。
    这是自1975年黎巴嫩爆发内战以来第3次组阁。胡斯在本月13日被授权组阁后，同黎各教派进行了多次接触和协商。
    由于黎军政府领导人奥恩的反对，直至穆阿瓦德总统22日遇害，黎政府仍未能组成。昨天晚上，黎议会选举赫拉维为总统后仅仅几个小时，黎巴嫩新政府就宣布成立，这使黎巴嫩局势发生出乎人们意料的急剧变化。
