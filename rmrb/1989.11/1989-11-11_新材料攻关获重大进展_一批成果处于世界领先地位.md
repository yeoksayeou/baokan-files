    Major Breakthroughs in New Materials Research
    Some Achievements Lead the World

    BEIJING, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) — Over the past decade, China's efforts in new materials technology have shifted from primarily serving military purposes to a focus on both economic and national defense construction, playing an increasingly significant role in technological advancement, economic growth, and social development.

    New materials science is a crucial component of the new technological revolution and the material foundation for developing new technologies. All countries around the world consider the development and application of new materials as a key strategic goal. According to incomplete statistics from 1988, China's new materials output has exceeded 7 billion yuan, generating 1.5 billion yuan in taxes. Since 1986, the National Natural Science Foundation has funded over 700 materials science projects, resulting in more than 1,600 research papers, significantly advancing the field of materials science. Currently, there are over 300 institutions and nearly 1,000 enterprises involved in new materials research in China, totaling around 400,000 people, with approximately 100,000 being technical personnel. Additionally, 12 state-level key laboratories related to materials science have been established, serving as talent cultivation bases.

    China has made significant breakthroughs in high-temperature superconducting materials, nonlinear optical crystal materials, third-generation rare earth permanent magnet materials, agricultural rare earth materials, automatic coiling technology for iron-based amorphous alloys with a capacity of hundreds of tons, organic separation membranes, and high-performance composite materials such as aramid fibers. Basic research has also yielded a number of important results.

    Today, at the National New Materials Technology Conference, Vice Premier and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian said that, reflecting on the 40 years since the founding of the nation, we have been able to rapidly develop science and technology because we have fully leveraged the advantages of the socialist system and relied on the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work. He emphasized that we must continue to uphold these fine traditions and, like the development of the "Two Bombs, One Satellite," make greater contributions in the field of new materials.

    新材料攻关获重大进展
    一批成果处于世界领先地位
    本报北京11月10日讯　记者蒋建科报道：我国新材料科技攻关经过近10年的努力，已由为军工服务为主转入军民结合、面向经济建设和国防建设的轨道，对推动技术进步、经济增长、社会发展起着日益重大的作用。
    新材料科学是新技术革命的重要组成部分，是发展新技术的物质基础。世界各国都把新材料的开发与应用作为科技发展战略的重要目标。据1988年不完全统计，我国新材料产值已超过70亿元，创利税15亿元。1986年以来，国家自然科学基金会资助的材料科学项目达700多个，完成研究论文1600多篇，推动了材料科学的进步。如今，我国从事新材料研究的单位有300多个、企业近千家，共计40万人，其中科技人员10万左右。还建成12个和材料科学相关的国家级重点实验室，成为培养人才的基地。
    我国还在高温超导材料、非线性光学晶体材料、第三代稀土永磁材料、农用稀土材料、百吨级自动卷取铁基非晶态合金技术、有机分离膜及芳纶等特种纤维高性能复合材料方面，取得重大突破，基础研究也取得一批重要成果。
    国务委员、国家科委主任宋健今天在全国新材料科技工作会议上说，总结建国40年的历程，我们之所以能够迅速发展科学技术事业，是因为充分发挥了社会主义制度的优越性，依靠自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神。他说，我们应当继续发扬优良传统，要像抓
  “两弹一星”那样，在新材料领域做出更大贡献。
