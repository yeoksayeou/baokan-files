After the National Day holiday, the exchange of monthly economic indicators for the machinery systems of 13 major cities across the country showed that from January to September, the Tianjin Machinery Industry Bureau achieved a total industrial output value of 2.02 billion yuan, an increase of 11.04% over the same period last year. The output value of short-term products increased by 46.10%, sales revenue increased by 24.64%, and realized profits increased by 20.82%. These indicators all ranked first among the four major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Shenyang.

The director of the Machinery Industry Bureau smiled as he spoke to the reporter: "For our bureau, there has never been a year as difficult as this one, but there has also never been a year as good as this one." It turns out that by the end of June, the budgeted enterprises in this bureau achieved a total tax revenue of 2.38 billion yuan, an increase of 13.25% over the highest level in 1985. How was this path "forced" out?

In recent years, Tianjin's machinery industry, which has long been in a buyer's market, has experienced the bitter taste of hitting rock bottom. Starting from last year, they worked tirelessly, with the director leading the way, inviting a group of experts to conduct an in-depth investigation and research for eight months. They thoroughly understood what needed to be developed and what needed to be reformed, and then focused on adjusting the product structure. They did the following:

First, they carried out a large-scale enterprise reorganization and made great efforts to adjust the product structure. Through research, they realized that the main contradiction facing the machinery industry is that the traditional production structure is increasingly unable to meet the changing market demands. The solution lies in making great efforts to adjust the product structure, so that key products can quickly form a production scale. To this end, while dissolving administrative companies, they reorganized all 346 enterprises in the bureau. They established enterprise groups with famous and excellent products as the leaders and key enterprises as the backbone. This changed the previous loose horizontal cooperation status of famous, excellent, and special products' supporting factories into a tight vertical subordinate relationship. Under effective industry management, favorable conditions were created to give full play to the comprehensive advantages of production factors. So far, this bureau has five products with output value and sales revenue exceeding the 100 million yuan mark. The coverage rate of submersible electric pumps accounts for more than 90% of the domestic market. Hydraulic presses, CNC machine tools, diesel engines, small and medium-sized motors, welding rods, reducers, and a batch of key products have all achieved large-scale production capabilities and are beginning to enter the scale economy.

Second, they made great efforts to carry out technological transformation. They analyzed more than 4,000 products one by one and decisively eliminated or reduced a batch of long-term products with high consumption and low efficiency. They freed up funds, energy, and raw materials to develop key enterprises, emerging industries, and short-term products. In the past two years, they have implemented preferential policies for 40 key products and 1/3 of the enterprises to carry out technological transformation. The new added value relying on technological progress has gradually reached 1/3 of the total output value of the bureau. Among the 240 new products developed, 72 products, including industrial robots, vertical machining centers, plate heat exchangers, and cold-resistant media paint lines, have reached the advanced level of the 1970s or 1980s internationally. The rest have reached the advanced level domestically.

Third, they opened up both domestic and international markets to seek a broad sales market for adjusting the product structure. Facing the trend of domestic market stagnation during the economic tightening period, they shifted their focus to the international market. While continuing to improve the production of 8 traditional export products such as welding rods, submersible motors, low-voltage electrical components, machine tools, valves, and electric motors, they supported a batch of technology-intensive products. Currently, products such as CNC machine tools, forging and pressing machine tools, forklifts, small and medium-sized motors, and grinders have successively entered the international market. While consolidating the markets of Hong Kong, Macau, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, they have expanded exports to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and are beginning to enter the North American and Western European markets.

At the same time, they paid great attention to giving full play to the enthusiasm of the majority of workers. In 94% of the established units in the bureau, the resolution rate of proposals from workers' congresses reached over 90%. In the face of difficulties, the party, government, trade unions, and youth leagues all worked together.

In the past, processing industries found it very difficult and troublesome to digest the price increases of raw materials. However, this bureau, relying on technological progress, accelerated the adjustment of the product structure, and increased the number of famous and marketable products. In the current situation of market demand stagnation, not only did they have room to maneuver, but they also reversed the passive situation of raw material price increases being higher than the price increases of finished products, and have initially entered a virtuous cycle. Two or three years ago, this was unimaginable.

Li Ruihuan comrade evaluated at the beginning of the year: Tianjin Machinery Industry Bureau has been in a buyer's market for several years, and it can be said that they have forced out a path for adjusting industrial production. They strategically despise difficulties and thoroughly analyze the situation; tactically, they value difficulties and take active steps, not seeking quick success and instant benefits, but rather solidly building the industry.

Difficulties forced them to leap out of the trough and onto the road to success.

　　困难逼出阳关道
　　——天津市机械工业局跃出谷底的调查
　　本报记者　肖荻
    国庆过后，全国13城市机械系统主要经济指标月度交换资料表明：1至9月，天津机械工业局工业总产值20.2亿元，比去年同期增长11.04％，短线产品产值比去年同期增长46.10％，销售收入增长24.64％，实现利润增长20.82％。这几项指标，均居京、津、沪、沈4大城市之首。
    机械工业局长面带微笑向记者说：“对我们局，从来没有今年这么难，可又从来没有今年这么好。”原来，到6月底，这个局预算内企业实现利税总额2.38亿元，比历史最高水平的1985年增长13.25％。路，是怎样“逼”出来的呢？
    近几年，一直处于买方市场的天津机械工业，曾饱尝谷底滋味。从前年起，他们埋头苦干，由局长带头，邀集一批专家扎下去，搞了8个月调查研究，把应兴应革、何去何从摸了个一清二楚，而后紧紧抓住调整产品结构这个中心环节，干了这样几件事：
    首先，实行大规模企业改组，下大力调整产品结构。通过调研，他们认识到，机械行业面临的主要矛盾是，传统的生产结构已越来越不适应发展变化的市场需求，出路在于下大力调整产品结构，使拳头产品尽快形成生产规模。为此，他们在撤销行政性公司的同时，对全局346个企业进行了全面改组，以名优产品为龙头、以骨干企业为依托，组建企业集团。使名、优、特产品的配套厂，由过去松散的横向协作状态，变为紧密的纵向隶属关系。在有效的行业管理下，为发挥生产要素的综合优势创造了有利条件。迄今，这个局已有5个产品的产值和销售收入突破1亿元大关。潜油电泵的覆盖率占国内市场90％以上。液压机、数控机床、柴油机、中小电机、电焊条、减速机等一批拳头产品均已具备大批量生产能力，开始走向规模经济。
    其次，下大力进行技术改造。他们对4000多种产品逐一分析后，断然淘汰或压缩了一批消耗高、效益低的长线产品，腾出资金、能源、原材料，用于发展重点企业、新兴产业和短线产品。近两年来，对40种重点产品和1／3企业落实倾斜政策，进行技术改造，使依靠技术进步新增的产值，逐步达到全局总产值的1／3。新研制成功的240项新产品中，工业机器人、立式加工中心、板式换热器、耐冷媒漆线等72项产品，达到国际七十或八十年代先进水平，其余达到国内先进水平。
    第三，开拓国内、国外两个市场，为调整产品结构寻求广阔的销售市场。面对经济紧缩时期国内市场疲软的趋势，他们把着眼点转向国外，在继续抓好电焊条、潜水电机、低压电器元件、机床、阀门、电动机等8种传统出口产品生产的基础上，扶持一批技术密集型产品。目前，数控机床、锻压机床、叉车、中小电机、磨床等产品已陆续打入国际市场，在巩固港澳、东南亚和中东市场的同时，扩大了对苏联、东欧的出口，并着手进入北美和西欧市场。
    与此同时，他们十分注意发挥广大职工的积极性。在全局94％建制单位，职代会提案落实率达90％以上。在困难面前，党政工团一齐上。
    过去，加工工业对消化原材料的涨价因素感到很吃力很苦恼。但这个局由于依靠技术进步，加速产品结构调整，名优、适销产品增加，在当前市场需求疲软情况下，不但有回旋余地，而且扭转了原材料涨价高于产成品涨价的被动局面，初步进入良性循环。倒退两三年，这是万万想不到的。
    李瑞环同志年初曾这样评价：天津机械工业局几年来始终处于买方市场，可以说逼出了一条调整工业生产的路子。他们战略上藐视困难，透彻分析形势；战术上重视困难，积极进取，不急功近利，而是扎扎实实办工业。
    困难，逼着他们跃出低谷，走上阳关大道。
