	The State Tax Bureau held an emergency telephone conference today with county-level and above tax bureau directors nationwide, calling on all tax officials to resolutely implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, mobilize urgently, overcome all difficulties, and ensure that industrial and commercial taxes for the year exceed the target by 6 billion yuan, making a contribution to the rectification and deepening of reforms.

	State Councilor and Minister of Finance Wang Boping attended the meeting and said that the overcollection is not to increase the tax burden on taxpayers, but to strive through hard work, strengthen tax collection management, and collect all taxes due, increasing fiscal revenue.

	It is reported that from January to October this year, the cumulative industrial and commercial tax revenue nationwide has reached 153.074 billion yuan, an increase of 19.1% over the same period last year. However, the situation to achieve the tax overcollection target for the year is still severe. First, industrial production in October has shown negative growth, and economic benefits will not improve significantly, and the trend of commodity stagnation will continue, which will inevitably be reflected in tax revenue. Second, tax arrears are serious, which will affect tax revenue. By the end of October, the cumulative industrial and commercial tax arrears nationwide have reached 11 billion yuan. Third, the progress of special consumption tax revenue is slow. Fourth, tobacco tax arrears are serious, with tobacco factories owing 4 billion yuan in taxes by the end of October.

	To ensure the realization of the 6 billion yuan overcollection target, the director of the State Tax Bureau, Jin Xin, requires that all localities: First, further unify their understanding and enhance the overall concept. Regions that can overcollect more should overcollect more and make more contributions; regions that can complete the overcollection task should strive to complete it; regions that face difficulties in completing the overcollection task should catch up quickly and strive to complete it. Second, the management of special consumption tax collection must adhere to the current policy and be strictly implemented. Third, the tobacco management, banking, and tax departments should work closely together, allocate funds, and ensure the realization of the national tobacco tax revenue plan of 16 billion yuan. Fourth, continue to focus on clearing up tax arrears, especially for major tax debtors, and strictly enforce the law to collect taxes as soon as funds are available. Fifth, conduct in-depth tax inspections.

    国家税务局紧急电话会议号召
    把应收税款都尽力收上来
    确保今年工商税超收60亿
    本报北京11月15日讯　记者潘岗报道：国家税务局今天召开全国县以上税务局长紧急电话会议，号召全国税务干部坚决贯彻党的十三届五中全会精神，紧急动员起来，克服一切困难，确保工商税全年超收60亿元，为治理整顿和深化改革多作贡献。
    国务委员兼财政部部长王丙乾到会讲话说，超收并不是要加重纳税人的税收负担，而是要通过努力工作，强化征收管理，把应收的税款都尽力收上来，增加财政收入。
    据介绍，今年1—10月份，全国累计工商税收已完成1530.74亿元，比上年同期增长19.1％，但要实现今年税收超收目标形势仍很严峻，一是工业生产10月份已出现负增长，经济效益不会有大的好转，商品滞销的势头将要继续下去，这些问题必然在税收上滞后反映出来。二是欠税严重，势必影响税收收入，截至10月底，全国工商税收累计欠税110亿元。三是特别消费税收入进展缓慢。四是烟税拖欠严重，10月底卷烟厂拖欠税款已达40亿元。
    为保证实现超收60亿元目标，国家税务局局长金鑫要求各地：第一，进一步统一认识，增强全局观念。能够多超收的地区，要多超收多作贡献；可能完成超收任务的地区，必须立足于完成；完成超收任务困难较大的地区，要急起直追，力争完成。第二，特别消费税的征收管理，要坚持按现行政策，严格执行。第三，烟草管理、银行、税务部门等要密切合作，调度资金，保证实现全国160亿元烟税的收入计划。第四，继续抓好清理拖欠税款工作，特别是对欠税大户，要紧盯不放，货款一到，首先依法征税。第五，深入进行税收大检查。
