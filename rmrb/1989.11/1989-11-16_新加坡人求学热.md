Singaporeans' Eager Pursuit of Education

Describing Singaporeans as lifelong learners who study until old age might be an exaggeration. However, many Singaporeans in their forties still have a passion for learning and a desire for self-improvement.

The spirit of diligent study among Singaporeans can be seen in their willingness to sacrifice leisure time, entertainment, and family gatherings to pursue professional diplomas, university degrees, and advanced research qualifications.

Part-time courses offered by national institutions of higher learning, such as the National University of Singapore, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, and Nanyang Polytechnic, attract over five thousand working professionals each year. Private business schools, computer schools, and law schools offer a wide range of continuing education courses, which are also very popular.

The Master of Business Administration program offered by the National University of Singapore's Business School is one of the most sought-after programs, attracting 393 students last year, 90% of whom were working professionals.

The computer engineering and commercial law diploma courses offered by the university's computer science and law departments are also highly popular.

Singapore is one of the world's most active free ports for business activities, constantly influenced by global trends. Over the past decade, with the rapid economic development, the importance of various professional knowledge has become widely recognized. To stay competitive, the only way is to keep learning.

In Singapore, almost anyone who is eager to learn can find a suitable course that matches their level and interests. Compared to the National University, the part-time diploma courses offered by Ngee Ann Polytechnic are more accessible to the general public. Each year, about four thousand working professionals enthusiastically enroll, willing to invest five years of their time.

Of course, these continuing education classes are primarily designed to provide opportunities for employees of large institutions to advance their studies. These large enterprises, driven by their own development needs, pay significant attention to their employees' continuing education.

For those who pursue learning, their biggest challenge is balancing family and career responsibilities while dedicating considerable effort to obtaining a diploma. Their extraordinary perseverance is commendable. Chen Yingqi, the deputy executive director of the Singapore Management Institute, said: Singapore is a society that is constantly changing and progressing. In this society, if one wants to continuously climb the career ladder, they must constantly enrich themselves and keep up with the pace and rhythm of the times.

    新加坡人求学热
    以活到老，学到老来形容新加坡人，未免有点夸张。可是，很多四十来岁的新加坡人仍有一颗热爱学习、力求上进的心。
    新加坡人发奋好学的精神，可以从他们在业余放弃娱乐、消遣和与家人欢聚的大好时光，而孜孜不倦地埋头攻读一个专业文凭、大学文凭和研究学位的热忱看出来。
    由国家高等学府，如国立大学、新加坡工艺学院、义安工艺学院等开设的部分时间课程，每年吸引超过五千名工作人员来进修。私立商科学校、电脑学校和法律学校所开办的进修课程，更是琳琅满目，每年报名者十分踊跃。
    国立大学企业管理学院所开办的商业管理硕士课程是硕士课程中备受青睐的一项，去年吸引了三百九十三名学生，其中百分之九十是在职工作人员。
    国大电脑系和法律系推出的电脑工艺和商业法律文凭课，也是热门。
    新加坡是世界上商务活动最频繁的自由港之一，经受着世界各地新潮的冲击。近十年，由于经济的迅猛发展，各种专业知识的重要作用渐为人们共识，一个人要在竞争中立于不败之地，唯一的途径就是不断学习。
    在新加坡，凡是有志于学习者几乎都可以找到一项适合其程度的并符合兴趣的修读课程。相对于国大的课程，新加坡工艺学院部分时间文凭课开设的课程更容易为普通人接受。每年，大约有四千名工作人员踊跃登门求学，他们愿意付出五年的时间。
    当然，这种进修班更多的目的是为一些大机构员工的进修创造条件。这些大企业从自身发展的要求出发，对员工的进修表现了很大关注。
    对于从学的人士来说，他们最大的困难是在照顾家庭、事业之余，还要花很大精力，苦苦去求得一纸文凭。他们这种过人的毅力令人钦佩。新加坡管理学院副执行院长陈颖祺说：新加坡是个每时每刻都在改变和前进的社会，在这个社会里，一个人若要在事业上不断攀登高峰，便得时时充实自己，提高自己，与时代的节奏和拍。
