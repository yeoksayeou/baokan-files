The snow-covered Changbai Mountain high-altitude ice and snow training base ski field welcomed its first official competition of the winter season today. Athletes from six units, including Jilin, Tonghua, Hunjiang, Harbin, the People's Liberation Army, and the Qianwei Sports Association, totaling 36 participants, will compete over four days. The best male and female athletes will be selected to represent China in the 6 events of the cross-country skiing competition at the second Winter Asian Games, scheduled to be held in Sapporo, Japan, from March 9 to 14, 1990.

Today, the men's traditional 10-kilometer race was held, with Wu Minyi from the Tonghua team securing the first place. In the women's traditional 5-kilometer race, Song Aiqin, a renowned skier from the People's Liberation Army team, took the top spot.

This selection competition will be conducted using a cumulative points system from multiple races. This includes the athletes' performances in international competitions last winter, the national championships in April this year, their summer land training results, this competition's results, and the results of the second snow competition scheduled for December. The top athletes will be selected based on these cumulative points.

　　“雪上飞”齐聚长白山
　　我参加冬季亚运会选拔赛开始
    据新华社长白山雪场11月19日电　（记者胡浩）白雪皑皑的长白山高原冰雪训练基地滑雪场，今天迎来了今年入冬以来的第一次正式赛会。
    来自吉林、通化、浑江、哈尔滨、解放军、前卫体协等6个单位的36名运动员将进行为期4天的比赛，从中选出男女优秀选手，代表我国参加明年3月9日至14日在日本札幌举行的第二届冬季亚运会越野滑雪比赛6个项目的角逐。
    今天进行了男子传统10公里的比赛，通化队的吴敏义获得这个项目的第一名，女子传统5公里比赛，解放军队滑雪名将宋爱芹获得第一名。
    这次选拔赛按几次比赛累计积分方法进行，即运动员去冬在国际比赛中的成绩和今年4月在全国锦标赛上的成绩，今年夏天的陆训成绩以及本次比赛成绩与今年12月将举行的第二次雪上比赛成绩相加选拔出优秀运动员。
