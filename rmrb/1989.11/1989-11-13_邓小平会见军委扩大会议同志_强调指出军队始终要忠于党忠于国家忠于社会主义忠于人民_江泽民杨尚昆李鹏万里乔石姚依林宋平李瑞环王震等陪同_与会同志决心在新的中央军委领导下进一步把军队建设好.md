Deng Xiaoping met with senior military officials attending the Military Commission expanded meeting this morning. He emphasized that our military is the Party's military, the military of a socialist country, and the people's military. The military must always be loyal to the Party, the country, socialism, and the people. Deng Xiaoping hopes that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and the Central Military Commission with him as the chairman, our military will make greater contributions to defending our country's independence and sovereignty, defending our country's socialist cause, and defending the series of lines, principles, and policies formulated since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.

At 9:30 AM, Deng Xiaoping, accompanied by CCP Central Committee General Secretary and Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin, State President and Central Military Commission First Vice Chairman Yang Shangkun, and other Party and state leaders Li Peng, Wan Li, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Li Ruihuan, and Wang Zhen, enthusiastically met with the attendees of the Military Commission expanded meeting. Deng Xiaoping shook hands with everyone and happily posed for a group photo.

Central Military Commission Vice Chairmen Liu Huaqing, Central Military Commission Secretary Yang Baibing, and Military Commission members Hong Xuezhi, Qin Jinguang, Chi Haotian, and Zhao Nanqi accompanied Deng Xiaoping in meeting with everyone.

Deng Xiaoping, full of vigor and passion, spoke extemporaneously. He said, "I am confident that our military can always adhere to its nature. This nature is that it is the Party's military, the military of a socialist country, and the people's military. I am confident that our military can do this, and decades of testing have proven that the military can fulfill its responsibilities."

Deng Xiaoping said, "The Military Commission leadership has changed. I think that the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core is the correct choice made by the entire Party. He is a qualified Military Commission chairman because he is a qualified Party General Secretary."

Deng Xiaoping said, "Although I have left the military and retired, I still care about the Party's cause, the country's cause, and the military's future."

The attendees of the Military Commission expanded meeting saw that Deng Xiaoping was in good health and had deep affection for the military, feeling deeply moved and inspired. Everyone resolved to follow Deng Xiaoping's requirements and, under the new Central Military Commission leadership, further improve military construction.
