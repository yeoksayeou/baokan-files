Taiwan Business Delegation to Visit Mainland China

According to a report by the Taiwan-based "China Times," a large delegation of Taiwanese businesspeople has recently formed a "Mainland China Investment Inspection Team," scheduled to visit Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities in early December.

The delegation is organized and led by the famous American-Chinese Chen Xiangmei. This is the first publicly declared delegation from Taiwan to visit the mainland since the two sides began interacting. It is understood that the Taiwanese authorities do not oppose this delegation, composed mostly of private enterprises and a few public enterprises, from visiting the mainland.

Chen Xiangmei, who serves as the delegation leader, said she does not approve of the previous practice of Taiwanese businesspeople secretly visiting the mainland. Therefore, she spent nearly a year organizing this delegation to visit the mainland openly and formally. Chen Xiangmei said, "Why can't Taiwanese businesspeople, who are also Chinese, do business with the mainland, instead of letting foreign companies make money there?"

According to the report, Chen Xiangmei is scheduled to arrive in Taipei on November 27th and will lead the delegation to depart from Taipei via Hong Kong to the mainland on December 3rd. The delegation plans to visit Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and Xiamen. The delegation members include representatives from banking, securities, aviation, transportation, tourism, fisheries, metallurgy, petrochemicals, textiles, and other industries.

　　台工商界投资考察团将访大陆
    新华社香港11月24日电　据台湾《中国时报》报道，台湾工商界人士最近组成一个大型“中国大陆投资考察团”，定于12月初前往北京、上海等地访问。
    考察团由著名美籍华人陈香梅组织并率队，是海峡两岸开始接触以来，第一个公开由台湾前往大陆的工商界考察团。据了解，台湾当局对于这一由绝大多数民间企业和少数公营事业组成的团体前往大陆访问“不表反对”。
    担任考察团团长的陈香梅说，她不赞成以往台湾工商业人士偷偷摸摸跑去大陆的做法，因此花了近一年的时间，促成这个团以公开、正式的身份前往大陆访问。陈香梅说，与其让外商赚大陆的钱，为什么同属中国人的台湾商人不能和大陆做生意？
    据报道，陈香梅定于11月27日抵达台北，12月3日率团自台北启程经香港前往大陆，计划访问北京、上海、广州、福州、厦门五地。考察团的成员包括银行、证券、航空、交通、旅游、渔业、金属、石化工业、纺织等业者的代表。
