In recent days, the Hem Hem Department Store in Bangkok has been unusually bustling. The "Today's Guangdong Products Exhibition" has attracted a large number of customers, businessmen, and entrepreneurs like a magnet.

The exhibition is grand in scale, with 107 companies and enterprises from Guangdong's light industry system and cities such as Guangzhou, Shantou, Shenzhen, Jiangmen, Foshan, and Maoming participating. The exhibition features over 2,000 different products. In addition to some traditional export products, most of them are light industrial machinery, household appliances, and daily necessities that have been developed in recent years.

People from various sectors in Thailand attach great importance to the exhibition. On October 4, Princess Sirindhorn of Thailand personally cut the ribbon for the exhibition and toured the exhibits. Local media have provided extensive coverage and commentary. People's first reaction to Chinese products is surprise. A Thai friend said that the exhibition has broadened his horizons. The products are so rich and innovative, beyond his expectations, and have shown him the tremendous changes and strength in Guangdong and even the whole of China in economic construction. Some customers said that some of the electrical products at the exhibition are indistinguishable from those of developed countries like Japan. Chinese medicines, health supplements, and medical equipment have captivated many customers. For example, the specific electromagnetic wave spectrum therapy device is called the "magic lamp," and medicines for treating AIDS are called "miracle drugs."

At the exhibition, people are fascinated by various products, especially household items, small hardware, ceramics, and jade crafts. Compared to some local products, people feel that Chinese products are more affordable. For example, the Five Goats brand bicycle is not only lighter, more flexible, and durable than local bicycles but also almost half the price. A customer is particularly fond of Chinese ceramics, buying them repeatedly over several days. In just six days, almost all the exhibited products were sold out, with a transaction amount of over $25 million.

Many businessmen, seeing this situation, proactively discussed with the exhibiting units to become agents for Chinese products. Some entrepreneurs have requested to jointly establish factories with the exhibiting units in Thailand.

The exhibition also showcased some advanced technologies and mechanical equipment, which have aroused great interest among Thai entrepreneurs. They believe these technologies and equipment are suitable for Thailand's industrial development. Therefore, they have requested to introduce technologies and equipment from China or to cooperate with China in establishing factories. So far, there have been more than 20 projects under discussion.

Currently, there are flights from Bangkok to Guangzhou and Shantou, making it convenient for exchanges between the two places. Last year, Guangdong (excluding Guangzhou, special economic zones, and foreign-funded enterprises) exported over $31 million worth of goods to Thailand. This product exhibition shows that not only do Chinese products have great sales potential in the Thai market, but economic and technological cooperation prospects are also very broad. People believe that with the development of Sino-Thai friendship, economic and trade cooperation between the two countries will become even closer.

    广东商品展在泰国
    本报记者　刘爱成
    连日来，曼谷闻闻百货商场异常热闹。“今日广东商品展销会”像磁铁一样，吸引着大批顾客、商人和企业家。
    展销会规模庞大，参展的有来自广东轻工业系统和广州、汕头、深圳、江门、佛山、茂名等城市的107家公司及企业。展出的商品达2000多个品种。除了部分传统的出口产品外，大部分是轻工机械、家用电器、日用品等近年来开发的新产品。
    泰国各界人士对展销会十分重视。10月4日，泰国皇储妃颂莎哇丽亲自为展销会剪彩并参观了展品。当地舆论作了大量报道和评价。人们对中国商品的第一个反映是惊奇，一位泰国朋友说，展销会使他大开眼界，产品如此丰富、新颖，出乎他的意料，使他看到了今日广东乃至全中国在经济建设方面的巨大变化和实力。有的顾客说，展销会上的一些电器产品已分不出与日本等发达国家产品有什么两样。中国的药物、补品及医疗机械，使许多顾客着迷。如特定电磁波谱治疗器被称之为“神灯”，治疗艾滋病等药物被说成是“神药”。
    展销会上，人们对展出的各种商品，尤其是家用器具、小五金、陶瓷、玉器等工艺品爱不释手。与当地一些商品相比，人们感到中国商品价格便宜。以五羊牌自行车为例，不仅比当地自行车轻便、灵活、结实，而且价格几乎便宜一半。一位顾客十分喜爱中国陶瓷，连着几天，买了一次又一次。仅六天，所展商品几乎销售一空，成交额达2500多万美元。
    许多商人看到这种情况，主动与展出单位洽谈，要求做中国商品代理。有些企业家要求与参展单位在当地合办工厂。
    展销会上，还展出了一些先进技术和机械设备，引起泰国企业家们的极大兴趣。他们认为这些技术、设备适合泰国工业的发展。因此，他们要求从中国引进技术、设备或要求中国出技术、设备与他们合作办厂。到目前为止，洽谈的项目已有20多个。
    目前，曼谷至广州和汕头都有航班，双方交往方便。去年，广东（不包括广州、特区及三资企业）对泰国的出口总值达3100多万美元。这次商品展销会表明，不仅中国商品在泰国市场销售潜力很大，而且经济技术合作前景也很广阔。人们相信，随着中泰友谊的发展，两国经济贸易合作将会更加密切。　（本报曼谷11月11日电）
