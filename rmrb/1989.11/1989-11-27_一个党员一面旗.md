The reconnaissance company of the Tank Regiment in the Tianjin Garrison is named by the Beijing Military Region as a "Model Company for Party Branch Building." However, flipping through this company's "record of merits," there are very few names of party members. Private First Class Chen Tao said, "I joined this company in 1987 and have observed it for two years. I found that the party members here step back during evaluations and awards, but step forward during hard times. A party member is like a flag!"

Political instructor Pei Yudé stutters when he gets nervous. He said, "My company commander and I are both young and eager, each wanting to push our respective tasks forward. Sometimes our schedules clash, and we get a bit frustrated. The soldier party members are very straightforward; they specifically hold small group meetings to criticize and help us, saying that 'party representatives' must be able to 'represent the party'! Later, we made a set of rules, and the conflicts were resolved harmoniously."

Last winter, the reconnaissance company conducted a wilderness survival training exercise. Each soldier carried 20 kilograms of gear, marched 65 kilometers for over 12 hours without food or water, crossed three mountains, and a large river. Along the way, the party members propagated and encouraged, helped comrades, and carried heavy items, ensuring that no one fell behind. The party members carried the most, with some carrying three submachine guns. At night, they camped in an old temple, and the party members "occupied" the outer perimeter to block the wind and keep warm. A soldier from Jiangsu, Jin Jianfu, said, "Because of this, I even argued with Platoon Leader Guo Wei. I wanted to sleep at the temple door where the wind blew in, but he insisted that I had to be a party member to sleep there. I was so angry that I wrote five party application letters back at the company. But that night, Guo Wei fell ill from the cold, and we were all worried about him."

Party members always stand at the forefront of the company. During holidays, it is the party members who stand guard, go up the mountain to break rocks, and detonate explosives. Dangerous and difficult tasks are not for non-party members. Even when the family guesthouse is full, it is the party members who give up their rooms.

The kitchen is a "sensitive area" in the company. Party members have never bought even a gram of oil, a pound of flour, or a vegetable, and they have never entertained anyone with a drink. One year on the afternoon of New Year's Eve, the political instructor's family had just arrived, and he asked the clerk Xu Yongming to help buy some vegetables in the county city. Little Xu wanted to buy from the kitchen, but the political instructor scolded him.

On the second day of the New Year, a few soldiers wanted to visit the political instructor's home for a feast. As soon as they entered, they were stunned to see only one cabbage and a few green onions. The couple was eating noodles. Everyone knew the political instructor's family was in difficulty, and his family member was also sick. They all wanted to go back and bring some dumplings from the company, but the political instructor's face turned stern: "Whoever dares to bring them, I will punish them!" Everyone had to sit down and drink a bowl of noodle soup.

The honor room records the footsteps of this company. This company was established in 1976 and has been rated as an advanced company for 11 consecutive years, and a model company for 4 consecutive years. It has been awarded a second-class merit and a third-class merit collectively.

Yang Baijin, Secretary of the Central Military Commission, once inspected this company. After learning about the role of the Communist Party members in this company's construction, he sighed and said, "Such party branches, such good party members, the more we have in our army, the better!"

　　一个党员一面旗

    天津警备区坦克某团特务连是北京军区命名的“党支部建设模范连”。然而，翻阅这个连队的“功劳簿”，里边却很少有党员的名字。上等兵陈涛说：“我1987年入伍分到这个连，整整观察了两年，发现这里的党员，评功评奖往后退，困难时候往前冲，一个党员就像一面旗子！”
    指导员培玉德，一紧张说话就结巴。他说：
  “俺和连长年轻气盛，都急着把自己分管的那摊工作抓上去，有时安排上撞了车，还怄点气。战士党员们很不客气，专门开小组会对我们批评帮助，说‘党代表’就要能‘代表党’！后来，我们搞了约法三章，使矛盾得到了合理解决。”
    去年隆冬，特务连进行野外生存训练，官兵每人负重20公斤，12个多小时水米未沾，强行军65公里，翻过了3座大山，渡过一条大河，一路上党员们宣传鼓动，搀扶战友，抢背东西，保证了无一人掉队。党员们最多的背了3枝冲锋枪。深夜，他们在一座破庙宿营，党员们“抢占”了外围挡风抗寒。江苏籍战士金建福说：“为这事，我还和七班长郭伟吵了起来，我想睡庙门风口上，他死活不让，非说我入了党才有资格睡，气得我回连一气写了5份入党申请书。可郭伟那晚上却因受寒而得了病，把我们心疼坏了。”
    党员时刻都站在连队的最前面。逢年过节，都是党员站岗，上山开石头，点炸药的也是党员，险事、难事非党员摊不上，连家属招待所住不开了，也是党员让房子。
    炊事班是连队的“敏感地区”。党员们在这里没买过一两油、一斤面、一棵菜，更没有招待什么人喝过一顿酒。有一年大年三十下午，指导员家属刚来队，请文书徐勇明帮助到县城买点菜，小徐想从炊事班买，被指导员克了一顿。
    大年初二，几个战士想到指导员家“打牙祭”，一进门愣了，只见他家只有一颗白菜几根葱，两口子正下面片吃，大家知道指导员家里困难，家属又有病，都要回去端些班里包的饺子，指导员却脸一板：“谁敢端我就处分谁！”大伙只好坐下一人喝了一碗面片汤。
    荣誉室里记载着这个连队的足迹，这个连1976年组建，连续11年被评为先进连队，连续4年被评为标兵连队，荣立集体二等功、三等功各一次。
    中共中央军委秘书长杨白冰同志曾经来这个连队视察，他了解到这个连队的共产党员们在部队建设中发挥的先锋模范作用后，感叹地说，这样的党支部，这样的好党员，我们部队越多越好！
