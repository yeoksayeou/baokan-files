Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, November 14th.

According to reports from Hong Kong newspapers, several Hong Kong notable figures have recently spoken at various events, pointing out that in the future, Hong Kong's sovereignty, governance, and administrative power cannot be internationalized; the relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland should be handled according to the "One Country, Two Systems" principle.

Administrative and legislative councilor Tam Wai-chu said on the 12th at a public forum that in the future, Hong Kong's sovereignty, governance, and administrative power cannot be internationalized. This point is clearly stated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law (draft). The Chief Executive and members of the Executive Council must be Chinese citizens. This core power of truly governing Hong Kong is very important to Hong Kong and cannot be internationalized. She also pointed out that economic internationalization is another matter. Hong Kong's economy has always been internationalized, which is beneficial to Hong Kong.

Regarding the future political relationship between the central government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Tam Wai-chu expressed that in the future, Hong Kong's National People's Congress representatives, Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference members, and the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region should all reflect the opinions and situations of Hong Kong people. Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee member Ng Shiu-pang also said at the same event that Hong Kong people can express their opinions on mainland policies to the Chinese government through normal channels, rather than adopting an interfering attitude.

Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee member Lee Fuk-shan said in an interview with the *Ta Kung Pao* reporter that if Hong Kong people want the mainland not to interfere in Hong Kong affairs, then Hong Kong people should not interfere in the mainland's internal affairs.

Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association Chairman Choi Wai-hang said at the association's member meeting the day before yesterday that Hong Kong people living under a capitalist system cannot completely identify with socialist beliefs, but the mainland, which practices socialism, cannot allow capitalist infiltration. It is precisely for this reason that "One Country, Two Systems" must be implemented to ensure that the two do not interfere with each other. If Hong Kong people try to use capitalist ideas to influence, interfere with, or even change the political reality of the mainland, it is very dangerous. He pointed out that the "governance" power of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" comes from China. Attempting to change the socialist system that the mainland insists on would mean there is no "One Country, Two Systems," which is unacceptable to China.

Choi Wai-hang expressed the hope that China, Britain, and Hong Kong will continue to cooperate sincerely and jointly build a bright future for Hong Kong.

### 香港一些知名人士指出  处理香港与内地关系须循“一国两制”原则

    香港一些知名人士指出
    处理香港与内地关系须循“一国两制”原则
    新华社香港11月14日电　据香港报纸报道，一些香港知名人士连日来在不同场合发表谈话指出，未来香港的主权、政权和治权不能国际化；要以“一国两制”的原则处理好香港与内地的关系。
    行政、立法两局议员谭惠珠12日在一个公开论坛上指出，将来香港的主权、政权和治权是不能国际化的，这点在中英联合声明和基本法（草案）中已写得很清楚，行政长官和行政会议成员必须是中国公民，这种真正管治香港的核心权力，对香港是很重要的，不能国际化。她同时指出，经济上的国际化是另一回事，香港的经济一向是国际化的，这对香港有好处。
    谈到将来中央与香港特别行政区的政治关系问题时，谭惠珠表示，将来香港地区的全国人大代表、全国政协委员以及香港特别行政区长官，都应反映香港人的意见和情况。香港基本法咨委会委员吴少鹏也在同一场合表示，港人可以循正常渠道向中国政府反映对内地政策的意见，而不要采取干预的态度。
    香港基本法起草委员李福善在接受《大公报》记者的采访时指出，香港人要内地不干预香港事务，则港人首先要不介入内地的内政。
    香港华人革新协会主席蔡渭衡前天在该会的会员大会上指出，生活于资本主义制度下的香港人不可能完全认同社会主义的信念，但实行社会主义的中国内地同样不能容许资本主义的侵袭。正由于这样，才要实行“一国两制”，使两者之间互不干预。如果港人想用资本主义的理念来影响、干预甚至改变内地的政治现实，是很危险的。他指出，“港人治港”的“治”权来自中国，企图改变内地坚持的社会主义制度，就无所谓“一国两制”，这是中国所不容许的。
    蔡渭衡表示，希望中国、英国、香港三方一如既往地忠诚合作，共同建设香港的美好将来。
