Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 25th.

Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Technical Supervision today took serious action against Shanghai Yikang Mineral Water Company for producing products that failed quality inspections twice and for covering up the facts. The bureau ordered the company to immediately halt production and sales of the JSK-W type Yikang home mineral water purifier, to recall all sold products, and recommended that relevant authorities take administrative action against the company's responsible personnel and direct culprits.

For a long time, Yikang Company's water purifiers have had quality issues. According to user feedback, some purified water contains visible contaminants, some users experience discomfort after drinking, and some products were banned after being tested by provincial and municipal inspection agencies. In July 1986, relevant departments inspected Yikang Company's water purification and mineralization equipment and the beverages produced using this equipment. They found that the purification and mineralization devices did not function properly. In the inspections conducted last year and this year, the water filtered by the JSK-W type home mineral water purifier exceeded the national bacterial standards, leading the municipal quality supervision department to order the company to stop production and sales. However, instead of taking a serious approach to rectifying the quality issues, Yikang Company leadership focused their efforts on public relations and repeatedly engaged in propaganda that contradicted the facts, seriously violating relevant provisions of the State Council's "Regulations on Industrial Product Quality Responsibility."

　　质量低劣不去抓　精力花在“公关”上
　　益康矿泉水公司受查处
    新华社上海11月25日电  （记者李正华）上海市技术监督局今天对产品质量两次抽查不合格，而又掩盖事实真相的上海益康矿泉水公司作出严肃处理，责令其立即停止生产和销售JSK—W型益康家用矿泉净水器，负责追回已出售的有关产品，并建议有关领导部门对公司负责人和直接责任者给予行政处理。
    长期以来，益康公司生产的净水器一直存在着质量问题。据用户反映，有的净水中有肉眼看得出的污染物质，有的饮用后有不舒适感觉，有的被外省市检验机构检验后禁止使用。1986年7月，有关部门对益康公司生产的净水器装置和使用该装置生产的饮料进行检查，发现净化矿化装置不起净水和矿化作用；在去年和今年的两次抽查中，用JSK—W型家用矿泉净水器过滤的水，细菌指标都超过国家规定的标准，由此，市质监部门责令其停止生产和销售。但益康公司领导对产品质量问题不是采取认真整顿的态度，而是把大量精力花在“公关”上，并多次进行违背事实的宣传，严重违反了国务院《工业产品质量责任条例》的有关规定。
