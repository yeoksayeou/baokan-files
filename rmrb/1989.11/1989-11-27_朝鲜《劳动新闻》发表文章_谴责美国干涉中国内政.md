	North Korea's Rodong Sinmun Publishes Article
		Condemning U.S. Interference in China's Internal Affairs
		Our reporter Xu Baokang reports from Pyongyang: The Rodong Sinmun, the organ of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, today published a commentary on the U.S. Congress passing the so-called "China Sanctions Amendment." It pointed out that the U.S. brazenly interfering in China's internal affairs is a hegemonic act that violates international law and infringes upon the sovereignty of another country.

	The commentary said, the Chinese government's suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing this June is a measure taken in accordance with China's constitution and laws. This is a matter of China's internal affairs that no one has the right to interfere with.

	The commentary pointed out that the United States not only makes groundless accusations and defamatory remarks about China's internal affairs, but also imposes pressure and passes the so-called "sanctions" "amendment." This is a gross infringement on China's sovereignty and a stain on the dignity of the Chinese people. The United States, ignoring international law and international conventions, infringes upon the sovereignty of other countries. This is a hegemonic act. China's expression of "great indignation" and "strong protest" against the U.S.'s unreasonable actions is entirely justified. The commentary concluded by saying that the United States attempts to portray itself as a "judge," arbitrarily interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, is a mistake of the times. The era of the United States doing as it pleases is gone forever.

　　谴责美国干涉中国内政
    本报平壤11月26日电　记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜劳动党中央机关报《劳动新闻》今天就美国参众两院通过所谓“对中国制裁修正案”发表评论，指出美国粗暴干涉中国内政是违反国际法，侵犯别国主权的霸权主义行为。
    评论说，中国政府今年6月平息北京反革命暴乱完全是根据中国的宪法和法律所采取的措施，这是任何人都无权干涉的中国的内政问题。
    评论指出，美国不仅对中国内政横加指责，诽谤中伤，而且还施加压力，通过了所谓“制裁”“修正案”，这是对中国主权的粗暴侵犯，是对中国人民尊严的玷污。美国无视国际法、国际贯例，侵犯别国主权，这是霸权主义行为，中国对美国的这一无理行径表示“极大愤慨”和“强烈抗议”是理所当然的。评论最后指出，美国企图把自己打扮成“裁判官”，肆意干涉别国内政，是犯了一个时代性错误。美国为所欲为的时代一去不复返了。
