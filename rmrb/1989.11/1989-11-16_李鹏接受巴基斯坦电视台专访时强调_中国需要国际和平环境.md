    Li Peng Emphasizes the Need for an International Peaceful Environment During Interview with Pakistani Television

    Our correspondent, Ren Yujun and Shi Zongxing, report from Islamabad on November 15th: This afternoon at 4 PM, Premier Li Peng was interviewed by Pakistani Television. He highly praised the friendship between China and Pakistan and discussed Sino-Indian and Sino-Soviet relations as well as China's foreign policy.

    Premier Li Peng first said, "I am very happy to meet the Pakistani people through Pakistani Television and to extend my best wishes. The friendly relations between China and Pakistan are very close and have stood the test of history. This friendship is based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between nations. The two peoples have always supported each other and engaged in friendly exchanges. We highly value Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's friendly visit to China in February this year, which shows her high regard for Sino-Pakistani friendship. This is my first friendly visit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, and I have been warmly welcomed by the Pakistani government and people, which has deeply moved me. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and I have held two rounds of talks, both of which were successful. This shows that the new generation of leaders in both countries are determined to pass down the torch of Sino-Pakistani friendship from one generation to the next. Recently, your country's Foreign Secretary visited China during a difficult period for China. This visit brought understanding and support from the Pakistani people to the Chinese people. Such friendship in times of difficulty is even more important and powerful."

    When discussing Sino-Indian relations, Premier Li Peng said, "Similarly, we also highly evaluate Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's successful visit to China last year, which improved relations between the two countries and is in line with the trend of the times. The long-term tension between China and India is mainly due to the border issue, which is a historical legacy. We are willing to solve the problem through friendly consultations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. These five principles were jointly created by two outstanding leaders of China and India."

    The improvement of Sino-Indian relations is not directed against any country in South Asia. On the contrary, the improvement of Sino-Indian relations will promote peace and stability in the South Asian region.

    When asked about the impact of improving Sino-Soviet relations on Sino-Pakistani and Sino-Indian relations, Premier Li Peng replied, "If there is any impact, it can only be a positive one. China and the Soviet Union are neighboring countries with a 7,000-kilometer common border. The long-term abnormal relations between the two countries are due to historical and realistic reasons. China's modernization drive requires a stable international peaceful environment. Therefore, China pursues an independent and peaceful foreign policy. China will not be attached to any world bloc and will decide its policy based on the merits of each international event."

    李鹏接受巴基斯坦电视台专访时强调
    中国需要国际和平环境
    本报伊斯兰堡11月15日电  记者任毓骏、史宗星报道：今天下午4时，李鹏总理在接受巴基斯坦电视台专访时，高度评价中国和巴基斯坦的友谊并谈及中印、中苏关系以及中国对外政策。
    李鹏总理首先说，我非常高兴通过巴基斯坦电视台同巴基斯坦人民见面并表示良好的祝愿。中巴的友好关系是非常亲密的，是经受了历史考验的。这种友谊是建立在国与国之间和平共处五项原则基础上的。两国人民一贯互相支持，友好往来。我们高度重视贝·布托总理今年2月对中国的友好访问，这表示了贝·布托总理对中巴友谊的高度重视。我第一次对巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国进行友好访问，受到巴政府和人民的热烈欢迎，这使我很感动。我和贝·布托总理举行了两轮会谈，都很成功。这表明我们两国新一代领导人是有决心把中巴友谊的火炬一代一代传下去的。不久前贵国外交秘书访华是在中国处于困难期间进行的。这次访问带来了巴基斯坦人民对中国人民的理解和支持。这种在困难期间的友谊显得更重要，更有力量。
    在谈到中印关系时，李鹏总理说，同样，我们也积极评价拉吉夫·甘地总理去年对中国成功的访问，这次访问改善了中印两国关系，符合时代潮流。中印两国长期关系紧张，主要是存在边界问题，这是历史遗留的。我们愿意在和平共处五项原则基础上通过友好协商来解决问题。而五项原则是中印两位卓越的领导人共同创建的。
    中印两国的关系改善绝不是针对南亚任何国家。相反中印关系的改善会促进南亚地区的和平与稳定。
    当记者问到改善中苏关系对中巴、中印关系有何影响时，李鹏总理回答说，如果说产生影响的话，那只能是好的影响。中苏两国是拥有七千公里共同边界的邻国，长期关系不正常也是历史原因和现实原因造成的。中国进行四个现代化建设，需要稳定的国际和平环境。所以中国对外奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，中国不会依附任何一个世界集团，她将根据每一世界事件的是非曲直来决定自己的政策。
