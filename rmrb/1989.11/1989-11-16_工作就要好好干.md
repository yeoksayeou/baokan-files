“Work Hard” is the behavioral principle of the Italian expert, Chebaro. Chebaro is a foreigner, hired to participate in the construction of our country's key project, the Huanneng Nantong Power Plant. However, he brought his long-standing work habits to China, winning the respect and friendship of the people.

After reading this news report, I don't know why, but I suddenly thought of a factory director's evaluation of some Japanese technicians: “They always work at a fast pace.”

Since the policy of opening up to the outside world, the material civilization of developed countries has been presented to us through various media. Amidst the dazzling array, some people feel the gap is too large. There are those who complain about fate, those who have too many grievances, those who lament the failure to turn iron into steel, and those who give up on themselves. In short, they have thought of everything, blamed everything, but overlooked a fundamental fact: the material civilization of developed countries is inseparable from the hard work of the people of those countries. Socialist China, to shake off poverty and enter a moderately prosperous society and further reach the living standards of moderately developed countries, apart from giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system, “working hard” is also an indispensable prerequisite. If we want to catch up with the living standards of developed countries, then “working hard” is not enough, we must work even harder. Because while we are catching up, others will not stand still, and they are still “running” ahead.

Unfortunately, due to years of poor guidance and the drawbacks of the “iron rice bowl,” the strong stimulus of Western material civilization has not sparked a “work hard” work drive, but rather a “work hard to buy” consumption drive. Among some people around us, do they work the full 8 hours from start to finish? How much social wealth have they created? If the consumption drive is much stronger than the work drive, and the enthusiasm for consumption is much higher than the enthusiasm for work, this is indeed very dangerous.

The ancients said: “Use people as a mirror, and you can know your gains and losses.” I think the reason why Chebaro's report is enlightening is that it provides a reference system. In the past, when we looked at developed countries, we often focused on one reference system: they are rich, we are poor. Through Chebaro, we have found another reference system, that is, they are rich and still work hard, we are not rich, but some people are not willing to work hard.

The factors that lead to low labor enthusiasm among workers are multifaceted. However, the lazy mindset of wanting to share the fruits of material civilization without paying the hard effort is a very important factor.

Socialism contains tremendous potential. This potential is reflected in each of us. If we work hard, we have hope. If we do not work hard, as Wang Jinxi said, “there is not a bit of Marxism-Leninism in it.”

### “工作就要好好干”

   “工作就要好好干”
    凌霄子
   “工作就要好好干”是意大利专家切巴罗的行为准则。切巴罗是一个外国人，受聘参加我国重点工程华能南通电厂的建设，但他把多年养成的工作习惯带到了中国，赢得了人们的尊重和友谊。
    读完这篇通讯，不知怎的，我忽然联想起一位厂长对一些日本技术人员的评价：“他们总是小跑着工作”。
    对外开放以来，发达国家的物质文明，通过各种媒介展现在我们面前。眼花缭乱之余，有些人痛感差距太大，怨天尤人者有之，牢骚太盛者有之，恨铁不成钢者有之，自暴自弃者有之。总之，什么都想到了，怪到了，唯独忽略了一个基本的事实，即发达国家的物质文明，是和那些国家人民群众的辛勤劳动分不开的。社会主义中国，要摆脱贫穷进入小康并进而达到中等发达国家的生活水平，除发挥社会主义制度的优越性外，“好好干”也是不可少的前提。若要赶上发达国家的生活水准，则“好好干”还嫌不够，必须加倍干才行。因为在我们追赶别人的时候，人家不会停步不前，而且还在一路“小跑”着呢。
    遗憾的是，由于多年来引导不力，加上“铁饭碗”的弊端，西方物质文明带来的强刺激，没有激发起“加油干”的工作冲动，却激发起了“加油买”的消费冲动。在我们周围的一些人，上班是否从头到尾干满了8个小时？创造的社会财富究竟有多少？如果消费冲动远比工作冲动来得强烈，消费热情远比工作热情高涨，这实在是危险之至。
    古话说：“以人为镜，可以知得失。”我认为切巴罗的报道所以给人启发，关键就在于提供了一个参照系。过去我们看发达国家，往往仅盯住一个参照系：人家太富，我们太穷。通过切巴罗，我们寻找到了另一个参照系，就是人家富了仍然在好好干，我们不富，有些人却不愿意好好干。
    导致职工劳动热情不高的因素是多方面的。但是，急于分享物质文明成果，不愿为之付出艰苦努力的惰性心态，是很重要的因素之一。
    社会主义蕴藏着巨大的潜力。这潜力表现在我们每一个人身上。干，我们就有希望。不干，就像王铁人说过的，“半点马列主义也没有。”
