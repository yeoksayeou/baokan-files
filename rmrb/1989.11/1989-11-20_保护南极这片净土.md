The member countries of the Antarctic Treaty held their 15th consultative meeting in Paris in mid-October this year to discuss scientific activities in the Antarctic region and the future of the Antarctic.

Since the Antarctic Treaty came into effect in 1961, member countries have held a consultative meeting every two years. Although these meetings are seen as a model of international cooperation and 12 countries have already established research stations in the Antarctic, many issues regarding the prevention of pollution on the Antarctic continent and the protection of the Antarctic ecological environment have not been truly resolved. In recent years, the increasing concern for the ecological environment has made environmental protection a political issue. Western politicians have included environmental protection in their election platforms, and ecological organizations such as the Green Party have also taken the stage in European politics. This year's Antarctic Treaty consultative meeting has attracted more attention from all sides than in previous years.

The "Wellington Convention" regarding the mining of resources in the Antarctic has been under discussion for modification for six years. This international convention stipulates that mining and oil extraction in the Antarctic are not permitted unless agreed upon by all signatory countries of the Antarctic Treaty. However, France and Australia, which participated in the drafting of the convention, have issued a joint statement opposing the Wellington Convention and calling for more comprehensive measures to protect the Antarctic environment. Italy, India, and Belgium have expressed support. At this consultative meeting, many countries believe that merely prohibiting mining is not enough to protect the Antarctic environment.

A few years ago, similar promises were made in Alaska's Prince William Sound, but the Exxon Valdez oil spill still occurred. In January of this year, the Argentine supply ship Bahia Paraiso ran aground in the Antarctic, leaking approximately 70,000 gallons of diesel fuel, causing significant damage to the Antarctic food chain. Experts believe that although the Antarctic is rich in coal, the large amounts of dust generated during mining would be carried by the wind, darkening the ice, increasing heat absorption, and melting the ice, leading to a rise in sea levels and the submergence of many coastal cities. The use of explosives and seismic reflection for prospecting would increase water pressure, causing the ice to break apart in large chunks. These massive icebergs falling into the sea would cause enormous tsunamis and unpredictable casualties.

The seventh continent on Earth, the Antarctic, is one of the most important parts in the formation of the Earth's climate. The Antarctic has 90% of the Earth's natural ice, with the thickest ice layer reaching 4.77 kilometers. Many large flat ice shelves in the Antarctic have already collapsed, with the largest one having an area equivalent to Belgium. The Antarctic continent has a precipitation rate that is not much higher than the Sahara Desert, and its vast floating ice is formed from a small amount of snowfall over the past 100,000 years. The Antarctic is extremely cold, with an average temperature of -76 degrees Fahrenheit. However, when warm ocean currents approach the frozen soil, they can generate hurricanes with speeds of up to 200 miles per hour. The Antarctic has the purest air on Earth, with almost no fog. The limited organisms living on the plains, ice, and oceans are in a very fragile balance, and once disturbed, they are difficult to recover.

Participants also raised many other issues related to the protection of the Antarctic continent's ecological environment. Some experts believe that the 2,500 tourists who visit each year can become witnesses to the promotion of Antarctic protection. An Australian company is building a 2,800-meter runway, a simple airport for jet planes, and a five-story hotel, planning to accommodate 16,000 tourists annually. For $30,000, one can go to the Antarctic for a honeymoon. The development of tourism has added new pressures to the ecological environment of this continent.

The construction of Antarctic scientific research stations has also had an impact on the ecological environment. The simple airport built by France at the Dumont d'Urville station has been criticized by the Greenpeace organization because the ice surface was blasted to create the runway, which also drove away the penguins and other birds living there. In mid-October, a fuel tank near the McMurdo Bay research station in the United States also leaked, spilling 52,000 gallons of jet fuel and diesel fuel. The McMurdo research station is not the first to pollute the environment. In the 1960s, the United States installed three nuclear reactors, which nearly had several accidents. Ten years later, the reactors, along with the contaminated soil and rocks, were all removed, and the cleanup work took six years.

The ecological environment of the Antarctic is fragile. Turning the Antarctic into a pollution-free world park and maintaining its relatively pristine ecological environment is not an easy task.

The Antarctic belongs to everyone and yet to no one. This year's consultative meeting seems to have drawn more attention to the Antarctic, but people hope that effective measures will be taken to protect this pristine land.

    保护南极这片净土
    梁丽娟
    《南极条约》成员国于今年10月中旬在巴黎举行了第15届协商会议，就南极地区的科研活动和南极的前途问题进行讨论。
    自从1961年《南极条约》生效以来，成员国每两年召开一次协商会议。虽然这些协商会议被看成为国际合作的模式，也已有12个国家在南极建立了科研站，但是有关防止污染南极大陆、保护南极生态环境的许多问题远没有真正解决。近年来人们对生态环境的日益关注，使环境保护成为政治问题之一。西方政界人士将环境保护列入竞选政纲，生态组织如绿党等也登上欧洲政治舞台。今年的《南极条约》协商会议也较往年更引起各方面重视。
    关于在南极开采矿藏的“威灵顿公约”已经酝酿修改了6年。这个国际公约规定除非经所有南极条约缔约国同意，否则不得在南极采矿及采油。但是参加起草公约的法国、澳大利亚已发表联合声明，反对威灵顿公约，要求采取更全面的保护南极环境的措施。意大利、印度及比利时表示支持。在这次协商会议上，许多国家认为仅仅禁止开采还不足以保护南极的环境。
    几年前各国也曾在阿拉斯加的威廉王子湾作过同样许诺，但依然发生了埃森石油公司的恶性漏油事故。今年1月，阿根廷供应船巴伊亚·帕拉索号在南极搁浅，至今已漏出约7万加仑柴油，它对南极食物链造成破坏性后果。专家们认为南极虽然蕴藏了丰富的煤，但开采时必然产生的大量尘土被风卷起扩散，从而使冰的颜色变深，吸热溶化，导致地球洋面升高，淹没许多沿海城市。用炸药和地震折射探矿将增加水的压力，使冰面因爆炸而大块解体。这些庞大冰块掉入海里将引起巨大的海啸和难以预计的伤亡。
    地球上的第7大陆南极是形成地球气候的最重要部分之一。南极有地球90％的天然冰，最厚的冰层达4.77公里。南极现已崩塌了许多大块平面的冰山，其中最大的一块面积相当于比利时那么大。南极大陆大部分地方的降雨量不比撒哈拉沙漠多，它的大堆浮冰是最近10万年内的小量降雪积成的。南极很冷，平均温度是华氏零下76度。但当暖海流近冻土时，又能掀起时速200英里的飓风。南极有地球上最清新的空气，几乎没有雾。生活在平地、冰、海洋中的有限生物都处于非常脆弱的均衡状态，一经破坏便难以恢复。
    与会者还提出了其他许多有关保护南极大陆生态环境的问题。有的专家认为每年这2500游客可以成为宣传保护南极的见证人。澳大利亚一家公司正在修建2800米跑道、能降喷气机的简易机场和一所五层楼的旅馆，计划每年接待16000名游客。花3万美元便可到南极去度蜜月。旅游业的发展给这块大陆生态环境增加了新的压力。
    南极科学考察站的建设对生态环境也产生了影响。法国在迪蒙迪尔维尔站修的简易机场受到绿色和平组织的指责，因为在岛上炸平冰面修跑道时也轰走了在那里生息的企鹅和其他鸟类。10月中旬，美国麦克默多湾考察站简易机场附近的燃料包也发生了漏油事故，漏出了52000加仑喷气机和柴油机燃料。麦克默多考察站已不是第一次污染环境了。60年代时美国安装3个核反应堆，后来好几次差点出事故。10年后反应堆连同被污染的土壤、岩石统统被运走，清理工作花了6年。
    南极的生态环境是脆弱的。要把南极变成没有污染的世界公园，保持它相对原始的生态环境，并非易事。
    南极属于所有人，又不属于任何人。今年的协商会议似乎引起了更多的对南极的关注，但人们期望切实采取有效措施，保护南极这块净土。
