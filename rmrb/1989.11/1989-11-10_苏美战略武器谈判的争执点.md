Title: Points of Dispute in Soviet-American Strategic Weapons Negotiations

The twelfth round of Soviet-American strategic nuclear weapons talks is currently being held in Geneva. Before the talks began, the Soviet Union abandoned its position of linking the reduction of strategic weapons with the prohibition of space weapons, while the United States abandoned its long-standing insistence on banning mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles. This has created favorable conditions for accelerating the strategic weapons talks. However, there are still some serious points of dispute between the two sides, mainly the following four:

	— Itemized Limits. The United States proposes that the number of warheads on land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles should not exceed 3,000 out of a total of 4,900, aiming to reduce the advantage of Soviet land-based missiles; the Soviet Union, on the other hand, demands that the United States reduce its submarine-launched ballistic missile warheads to 3,000, to limit the advantage of American submarine-launched missiles. This is actually a strategic issue arising from the different structures of the two sides' nuclear forces. The main body of the Soviet Union's strategic nuclear strike force is land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, with over 6,400 warheads, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total number of Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile warheads. According to the U.S. plan, more than half of the Soviet Union's land-based missile warheads would need to be cut, which could have a devastating effect on the Soviet Union's strategic nuclear forces. The backbone of the United States' strategic nuclear strike force is submarine-launched ballistic missiles. According to reports, there are about 5,400 submarine-launched missile warheads, also accounting for more than two-thirds of the total number of U.S. intercontinental ballistic missile warheads. According to the Soviet Union's demand, the number of U.S. submarine-launched missile warheads would need to be reduced by nearly half, and the number of nuclear submarines would also be reduced from the current 36 to 18. This would similarly severely weaken the United States' strategic nuclear forces. Both sides want to use the negotiations to weaken the other while preserving themselves, so their positions are difficult to reconcile.

	— Calculation Methods. The United States proposes that each heavy bomber carrying nuclear cruise missiles should be counted as having 10 nuclear warheads, while the Soviet Union insists on counting according to the actual design capacity of the bombers. This is because the design capacity of various types of heavy bombers currently in service in the United States is all above ten, for example, the B-52 bomber can carry twelve, while most Soviet bombers can only carry six. If the U.S. proposal is followed, the U.S. strategic bomber weapon system would actually be far superior to the Soviet Union's. For the Soviet Union, insisting on accurate counting is a way to limit the U.S. cruise missile advantage, so it is something they must fight for.

	— Deployment Regions. Since mobile land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles are difficult to verify, both sides have agreed in principle to limit the deployment of such missiles to certain specific regions. However, there are still differences of opinion on the specific scope of these limitations: the Soviet Union advocates for larger deployment areas, while the United States advocates for smaller ones. The implications are obvious. It is noted that the Soviet Union is far ahead of the United States in mobile land-based missiles. In recent years, the Soviet Union has deployed a considerable number of SS-24 and SS-25 mobile missiles with multiple and single warheads, respectively, while the United States only recently decided to deploy the single-warhead Midget mobile missile and make the MX multiple-warhead missile mobile.

	— On-Site Verification. To facilitate verification, the Soviet Union and the United States must open up missile launch silos, mobile missile deployment areas, bomber bases, nuclear submarine bases, and missile production factories to each other. The United States has proposed a specific implementation plan for "verification before agreement." The Soviet Union is not without suspicion of the U.S. side's "sincerity." Therefore, the verification issue remains another point of contention between the two sides.

Strategic nuclear weapons are the core of Soviet-American arms reduction talks, affecting the balance of power and national security interests of both sides. Moreover, strategic weapons are complex in type and numerous in model, and only partial reductions are being discussed, making verification even more difficult. This makes the ongoing talks quite challenging, and reaching an agreement will be a lengthy process.

    苏美战略武器谈判的争执点
    周爱群
    苏美第十二轮战略核武器会谈正在日内瓦举行。谈判开始之前，苏联放弃了将削减战略武器与禁止太空武器挂钩的立场，美国则放弃了一贯坚持的禁止机动洲际弹道导弹的主张。这就为加快战略武器谈判创造了有利条件。但是，目前双方仍然存在一些严重的争执点，主要有下面四个：
    ——分项限额。美国提出陆基洲际弹道导弹的弹头不得超过四千九百个中的三千个，旨在削减苏联陆基导弹的优势；苏联则要求美国将其潜射洲际弹道导弹弹头减至三千个，以限制美国潜射导弹的优势。这实际上是一个由于双方核力量结构不同而引出的战略问题。苏联战略核打击力量的主体是陆基洲际弹道导弹，有六千四百多个弹头，占苏联洲际弹道导弹弹头总数的三分之二以上。按照美国的方案，苏联的陆基导弹弹头需砍掉一半以上，这就可能对苏联的战略核力量产生伤筋动骨的效应。美国战略核打击力量的骨干是潜射洲际弹道导弹。据报道，共有五千四百来个潜射导弹弹头，也占美国洲际弹道导弹弹头总数的三分之二以上。按照苏联的要求，美国的潜射导弹弹头需减少近一半，其核潜艇数量也因之将由目前的三十六艘减至十八艘。这同样会使美国的战略核力量大伤元气。双方都想通过谈判来削弱对方，保存自己，因此彼此立场难以调和。
    ——计算方法。美国提出每架重型轰炸机所携带的核巡航导弹均按十个核弹头计算，而苏联坚持按轰炸机的实际设计能力计算。这是因为美国现役的各种重型轰炸机携带巡航导弹的设计能力均在十枚以上，比如B—52型轰炸机即可携带十二枚，而苏联大多数轰炸机仅能携带六枚。如按美方建议，美国的战略轰炸机武器系统实际上将远远优于苏联。对苏联来说，坚持如实计算就是限制美国的巡航导弹优势，因而是不能不力争的。
    ——部署地域。由于陆基机动洲际弹道导弹难以核查，所以，双方原则上同意将此类导弹限定部署在某些特定的地区内。但在具体的限定范围上，双方意见仍然相左：苏联主张的每个部署区域较大，而美国主张的要小。此中奥妙是不言而喻的。人们注意到，苏联在陆基机动导弹方面大大领先于美国。几年来，苏联已部署了相当数量的多弹头SS—24和单弹头SS—25两种机动导弹，而美国直到前不久才作出部署单弹头侏儒式机动导弹和使MX多弹头导弹机动化的决定。
    ——现场核查。为了便于核查，苏美必须相互开放导弹发射井、机动导弹部署区域、轰炸机基地、核潜艇基地以及导弹生产工厂等。美国提出了“先核查后协议”的具体实施方案。对于美国方面的“诚意”，苏联不无戒心。因此，核查问题仍是双方争论的又一焦点。
    战略核武器是苏美裁军谈判的核心，关系着双方实力消长乃至国家安全利益。加之战略武器种类复杂，型号繁多，又是部分削减，更加难以核查。这就使得正在进行的这项谈判具有相当大的难度，达成协议还将颇费周折。
