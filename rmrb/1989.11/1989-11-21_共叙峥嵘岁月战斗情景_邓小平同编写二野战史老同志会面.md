	Recalling Glorious Years of Struggle
	Deng Xiaoping Meets with Old Comrades Who Compiled the History of the Second Field Army

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 20 — (Reporter Liu Huinian) Deng Xiaoping today morning met with the editorial committee and the revision leadership group of the "History of the Second Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and consultants at the Great Hall of the People. Together with the old comrades, he recalled the glorious years of revolutionary warfare.

	Deng Xiaoping was very pleased to see the old comrades from the war years. He warmly shook hands with everyone, inquired about their health and work, and happily posed for a group photo with them. Then, he sat down with everyone to recall the scenes of struggle during the glorious years. Deng Xiaoping, with his remarkable memory, vividly described the magnificent scenes of the broad ranks of the Second Field Army resolutely executing the great strategic decisions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and successfully completing their combat missions. He said, the Second Field Army dared to take on heavy burdens, tackle difficult tasks, and complete and exceed the tasks assigned by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The reason they could do this was because of mutual trust and unity from top to bottom.

	The old comrades who participated in today's meeting included: State Councilor and Minister of National Defense Qin Jiwei, Vice Chairman of the Central Advisory Commission Song Renqiong, Standing Committee Member of the Central Advisory Commission Chen Xilian, Chen Zaidao, Liu Zhijian, Du Yide, He Zhengwen, Liu Youguang, Li Xuefeng, Rong Zihe, Nie Zhen, and others.

	The Second Field Army was originally an important part of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Deng Xiaoping and Liu Bocheng were always the highest leaders of this force. The predecessor of the Second Field Army was the 129th Division of the Eighth Route Army and the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region. It made outstanding contributions during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. From September 1945 to May 1951, with the close cooperation and strong support of the brotherly military regions, field armies, and the broad masses of the people, the Second Field Army achieved one victory after another in major campaigns and battles in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, Central, East China, and Southwest regions. This opened the curtain for the People's Liberation Army to launch a strategic counteroffensive and, together with the entire army, overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and established New China, making outstanding contributions.

	It is learned that the "History of the Second Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" is divided into two volumes. The first volume covers the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the second volume covers the period of the War of Liberation. The second volume will be published on next year's August 1, and the first volume will be published by the end of next year.

　　共叙峥嵘岁月战斗情景
　　邓小平同编写二野战史老同志会面
    新华社北京11月20日电　（记者刘回年）邓小平同志今天上午在人民大会堂会见《中国人民解放军第二野战军战史》编辑委员会和修改领导小组成员、顾问，和老同志一起共同回忆革命战争年代的光辉历程。
    邓小平同志见到战争年代的老同志十分高兴。他亲切地和大家一一握手，问候身体、工作情况，愉快地和大家合影。接着，他和大家围坐一起，共叙峥嵘岁月的战斗情景。邓小平同志以惊人的记忆力，畅叙了当年第二野战军广大指战员坚决执行党中央和毛主席的伟大战略决策，胜利完成作战任务的壮丽图景。他说，二野部队敢于挑重担，啃骨头，完成和超额完成党中央、毛主席赋予的每个任务。其所以能这样，是因为上下信赖，团结一致。
    参加今天会见的老同志有：国务委员兼国防部长秦基伟、中顾委副主任宋任穷、中顾委常委陈锡联，陈再道、刘志坚、杜义德、何正文、刘有光、李雪峰、戎子和、聂真等。
    第二野战军原是中国人民解放军的重要组成部分，刘伯承、邓小平同志一直是这支部队的最高领导人。二野的前身是八路军第129师暨晋冀鲁豫军区部队，它在抗日战争和解放战争中，作出了杰出的贡献。自1945年9月至1951年5月，二野在兄弟军区、野战军及广大人民的密切协同与大力支援下，于晋冀鲁豫、中原、华东和西南地区各个战场上，取得了一个又一个重大战役和战斗的胜利，为揭开人民解放军转入战略反攻的序幕，进而和全军一道推翻国民党反动统治，建立新中国立下了卓越的功勋。
    据悉，《中国人民解放军第二野战军战史》共分两卷，第一卷为抗日战争时期，第二卷为解放战争时期。明年“八一”先出版第二卷，明年底出版第一卷。
