Japan's Kansai Electric Power and others have recently successfully developed an electric vehicle using a new type of high-performance battery. This newly developed electric vehicle uses a sealed nickel-zinc battery, which can travel approximately twice the distance on a single charge compared to previous electric vehicles that used lead-acid batteries. Additionally, the vehicle body is made of glass-fiber-reinforced plastic, significantly reducing the vehicle's weight. Generally, it can travel about 180 kilometers on a single charge. Currently, this new type of electric vehicle is being noted as a prototype for next-generation electric vehicles in the automotive industry.

　　日研制出新型电动汽车
    日本关西电力等最近研制成功使用新型高性能蓄电池的电动汽车。这次新研制成功的电动汽车，采用的是密闭型镍锌蓄电池，它充电一次比以往使用铅蓄电池的电动汽车要多跑一倍的距离。此外，由于车体使用的是玻璃纤维增强塑料，车体重量大大减轻，一般每充电一次可行驶约一百八十公里。目前，这种新型电动汽车作为下一代电动汽车的雏型引起了汽车界的注目。
