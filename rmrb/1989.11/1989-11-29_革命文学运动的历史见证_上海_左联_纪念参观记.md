The memorial hall for the founding meeting of the Chinese Left-Wing Writers' League, after decades of searching and six years of restoration, was completed on the eve of the 60th anniversary of the "Left League" in Shanghai. The memorial hall is located at 145 Dōnglún Road, Hóngkǒu District, Shanghai. The renovated three-story Western-style building, with white brick walls, looks particularly refreshing. The not very large site is adorned with green leaves and red flowers, creating a simple yet elegant environment. In those days, Chinese left-wing writers frequently gathered here.

The birth of the Chinese Left-Wing Writers' League marked a new stage in the revolutionary literature movement. The current meeting site memorial hall, the adjacent original site of the National Academy of Arts, and the 400-plus precious historical documents, photographs, works, manuscripts, and relics of "Left League" writers displayed in the memorial hall, vividly and profoundly introduce to posterity the unyielding struggle and outstanding contributions made by left-wing writers, led by Lu Xun, for Chinese proletarian literature under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.

For many years, there have been various speculations about the location of the founding meeting site of the "Left League." Some said it was the current 145 Dōnglún Road Western-style building, where there are traces of the "Left League" predecessors; others said it was 233 Dùlè'ān Road, because the founding meeting of the "Left League" was held in the original National Academy of Arts, and 233 Dùlè'ān Road seemed to be the site of the National Academy of Arts. No one could say for sure where the founding meeting site of the "Left League" was.

Recently, the memorial hall construction team discovered a very precious photograph from Xu Xìngzhī, who served as the director of the Western Painting Department of the National Academy of Arts in the 1930s. The photograph shows the school sign of the National Academy of Arts, and it can be clearly identified that the building outline is exactly the same as 233 Dùlè'ān Road (now 201 Lóng, Lane 2, Dōnglún Road). Thus, this photograph, which was finally obtained from a Chinese-American student at the National Academy of Arts in Hawaii and handed over to Xu Xìngzhī, confirmed the founding meeting site of the "Left League."

In the first-floor reception hall of the memorial hall, there is a calligraphy by Lu Xun and his favorite woodcut works by Käthe Kollwitz. On the second floor, there are four exhibition rooms displaying documents and materials of the "Left League."

The author first noticed that Comrade Pān Hànnián, as the representative of the Party during the "Left League" period, had his historical status restored. His portrait is prominently displayed in the exhibition. The photograph of the first committee of the "Left League" is also arranged in the order of Shěn Duānxiān (Xuān Yán), Fēng Nǎichāo, Qián Xìngcūn, Lù Xùn, Tián Hàn, Zhèng Bǐqí, and Hóng Língfēi, respecting history. Many exhibits are either discovered for the first time in China or are being exhibited for the first time, such as the internal mimeographed publication "Literary Life" of the "Left League," which was printed by the "Left League" Secretariat on January 6, 1934, and is only seen in the first issue, belonging to Lu Xun's relics. The English notebook, ashtray, and camera used by Qú Shí, one of the five martyrs of the "Left League," were originally treasured by the martyr's daughter, Zhào Xiǎowēi. The debut works of 26 "Left League" members reflecting the characteristics of the era are also exhibited in the memorial hall for the first time.

In the process of collecting materials, more than 40 cultural and intellectual figures across the country, including Xuān Yán, Yáng Hànshēng, Hè Jìngzhì, Chén Huāngméi, and Zhōu Hǎiyīng, provided specific guidance and assistance. Zhang Aìpíng, an alumnus of the National Academy of Arts, wrote the plaque for the memorial hall; Wei Wénbó, despite being ill, drafted a proposal for the restoration of the "Left League" meeting site; Li Huíyīng, a "Left League" member residing in Hong Kong and in his 70s, donated his works and related materials for the restoration of the "Left League" meeting site; the cultural system of Hóngkǒu District, Shanghai, and other social organizations also held charity performances and financial support for the restoration of the "Left League" site. The stone tablet erected in the courtyard is engraved with the names of units, organizations, and individuals who contributed to the restoration of the "Left League" site. (See attached picture)

    革命文学运动的历史见证
　　——上海“左联”纪念参观记
    俞松年
    中国左翼作家联盟成立大会会址纪念馆，经数十年寻觅，又经六年修复，于“左联”诞生六十周年前夕在上海落成。纪念馆座落在上海市虹口区多伦路145号。修缮一新的三层西式楼房，白线砖墙，看来格外爽目。不算很大的场地上，点缀着绿叶红花，环境简朴而优雅。当年，中国左翼作家们频繁在这里活动。
    中国左翼作家联盟的诞生，标志着革命文学运动的新阶段。现在的会址纪念馆、毗邻的原中华艺术大学校址和纪念馆所陈列的400余件珍贵文献史料、照片、“左联”作家部分作品、手稿以及烈士遗物，深刻、形象地向后人介绍了以鲁迅为旗手的左翼作家在中国共产党领导下，为中国无产阶级文学所作的不屈不挠的斗争和卓越的贡献。
    多少年来，对“左联”成立大会会址在哪里，曾有种种猜测。有人说是现今多伦路145号的西式洋楼，这里有“左联”先辈留下的足迹；有人说是窦乐安路233号，因当年“左联”成立大会在原中华艺术大学内召开，而窦乐安路233号仿佛就是中华艺大校址。“左联”成立大会会址到底在哪里，谁也说不清。
    前不久，纪念馆筹建处人员从三十年代曾任中华艺大西画系主任的许幸之先生那里发现了一帧极为珍贵的照片。照片显示了中华艺术大学的校牌，而且可以清楚地辨认出，建筑物轮廓与窦乐安路233号
  （即现今的多伦路201弄2号）毫无二致。这样，这张几经周折方从夏威夷的一美籍华人、原中华艺术大学学生处转入许幸之先生之手的照片，确定了“左联”成立大会会址。
    在纪念馆一楼会客厅，悬挂着鲁迅手书的条幅和他所喜欢的珂罗维支木刻作品。在二楼的四间陈列室，则陈列着“左联”的文献资料。
    笔者首先注意到潘汉年同志作为“左联”时期党的代表，他的历史地位得到重新恢复。他的遗像被放置在展览的突出地位。“左联”第一届常委的照片，为尊重历史，也按沈端先（夏衍）、冯乃超、钱杏邨、鲁迅、田汉、郑伯奇、洪灵菲这样的次序排列。不少展品是国内第一次发现或是首次展出，如“左联”内部油印刊物《文学生活》，是1934年1月6日“左联”秘书处编印的，仅见第一期，系鲁迅遗物。“左联”五烈士之一的柔石的英文笔记本、使用过的烟灰缸、照相机，原系烈士女儿赵小薇珍藏。26部反映当时的时代特色的“左联”成员处女作，也首次陈列在纪念馆。
    在资料征集工作中，夏衍、阳翰笙、贺敬之、陈荒煤、周海婴等全国40多位文化界、知识界人士作了具体的指导、帮助。中华艺大校友张爱萍挥毫为遗址纪念馆书写标牌；魏文伯病中以口代笔，为宣传恢复“左联”会址拟稿；现寄居香港、年已古稀的“左联”成员李辉英先生为修复
  “左联”会址捐献了他的著作和有关资料；上海市虹口区文化系统及其他社会团体还为修复“左联”遗址举行义演和出资赞助。竖立在庭院中的那块石碑，镌刻着有功于“左联”会址修复的单位、团体和个人姓名。（附图片）
