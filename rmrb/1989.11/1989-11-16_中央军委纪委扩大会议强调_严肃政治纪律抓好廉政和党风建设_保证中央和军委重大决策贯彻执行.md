Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 15th. (Reporter Luoyuwen) The enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission Discipline Inspection Commission, which concluded today, emphasized that in the new situation, the military discipline inspection work should ensure the implementation of major decisions by the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission through good party discipline and style, ensuring that the military remains politically qualified.

Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission Liu Huaqing, Secretary of the Central Military Commission Yang Baibing, and members of the Central Military Commission Hong Xuezhi, Chi Haotian, and Zhao Nanqi met with all participants of the meeting. Liu Huaqing praised the achievements of the military discipline inspection work, noting its significant role in political education, clean governance, and party discipline construction.

At the meeting, Guo Linxiang, Secretary of the Central Military Commission Discipline Inspection Commission, conveyed the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, the Enlarged Meeting of the Military Commission, and the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission. He delivered a report titled "Strengthening the Party's Discipline Inspection Work in the Military to Ensure the Military's Political Qualifications." He said that the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee made major decisions on further rectification and deepening reforms. The Enlarged Meeting of the Military Commission proposed the guiding ideology for the military's work next year. Ensuring the implementation of these major decisions and policies is not only an economic and military issue but also a political one. All levels of party organizations and Communist Party members must strengthen their party spirit, strictly adhere to discipline, strengthen party supervision, and consciously implement the policies, decisions, and resolutions of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission. They must uphold the authority of the Central Committee and the Central Military Commission and resolutely oppose decentralization and individualism.

Guo Linxiang emphasized that adhering to the absolute leadership of the Party and ensuring the military's political qualifications have set new and higher requirements for all levels of discipline inspection commissions. He said that we face arduous tasks and heavy responsibilities. All levels of discipline inspection commissions and broad masses of discipline inspection cadres must be spirited and bravely shoulder this glorious task.

The enlarged meeting of the Military Commission Discipline Inspection Commission reviewed the work of the military discipline inspection agencies over the past year. It pointed out that all levels of military discipline inspection commissions have implemented the relevant decisions and instructions of the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Discipline Inspection Commission. They have done a lot of work in maintaining the Party's political discipline and promoting party discipline construction, with a focus on clean governance. In the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, all levels of military discipline inspection commissions stood firm, held high the banner, and adhered to party principles. The Party's discipline inspection work has withstood severe tests.

The meeting believed that ensuring the military's political qualifications is the top priority in military construction and a major issue in military political construction. All levels of discipline inspection commissions should naturally regard this as the first priority and actively carry out work around ensuring the military's political qualifications. They should ensure the implementation of the Party's lines, policies, and the decisions, instructions, and orders of the Military Commission with good party discipline and style, ensuring the stability and unity of the military, and ensuring the military's political qualifications.

The meeting believed that in the future, military discipline inspection work should focus on six key areas: (1) Strictly enforce the Party's political discipline to ensure that the entire military is politically aligned with the Party Central Committee; (2) Establish a sense of the overall situation and use iron discipline to ensure the smooth implementation of major decisions by the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission; (3) Promote clean governance and party discipline construction; (4) Implement the principle of strict party governance and seriously investigate and handle party disciplinary cases; (5) Pay attention to grassroots discipline inspection work and ensure that stable work is implemented at the grassroots level; (6) Strengthen the construction of discipline inspection commissions and fully play their functional roles.
