By chance, the author had a conversation with Feng Yaozhong, the Party Committee Secretary of Shenyang Refrigerator Factory, about ideological work. He said that ideological work involves many aspects, but a key issue is to be good at harmonizing people's hearts. Only when people's hearts are united can their spirits be lifted, and their enthusiasm can be mobilized to work together towards a common goal. These words were said in the context of an enterprise's ideological work, but they make one think of broader implications.

As the saying goes, "With hearts united, even mountains can be moved," which is indeed a profound truth. In the early 1960s, life was so difficult, but why were people able to maintain such high spirits and follow the Communist Party? Ultimately, it was because people were in harmony and united, and no matter how great the difficulties, we could overcome them. On the other hand, if people are not in harmony and united, but instead are full of grievances, not only will it be difficult to overcome difficulties, but even in times of prosperity, problems may arise.

In recent years, our country has achieved great successes in reform and modernization, and the people are generally satisfied. However, it is also undeniable that people's hearts are not as united as before, and some have even become scattered. The main reason for this is the spread of bourgeois liberalization, which has confused people's minds. Additionally, there are two other reasons: one is the existence of corruption, and the other is unfair distribution. These two issues directly affect the people's interests and should be given serious attention, but unfortunately, they have not been effectively addressed. Therefore, when these issues are mentioned, people often feel discontented.

Recently, the Party and the government have done several things that are very much in line with the people's wishes, such as canceling special supplies and rectifying the five major companies, which have become hot topics of discussion among the people. The significance of these actions lies not only in their immediate impact but more importantly in demonstrating the Party and government's resolve, thereby harmonizing people's hearts and lifting their spirits. This is most welcome. It is hoped that leaders at all levels will do more work to harmonize people's hearts, resolve contradictions, clear channels, and enhance cohesion. In this way, no matter how great the storms, we will not be afraid.

### 人心顺才能人心振

    人心顺才能人心振
    常青
    一个偶然的机会，笔者和沈阳电冰箱厂党委书记冯耀忠同志聊起了思想工作问题。他说，思想工作头绪很多，但关键问题之一，就是要善于理顺人心。人心顺了，才能振奋精神，把大伙的积极性调动起来，同心同德朝着一个目标前进。这话是就一个企业思想工作而言的，但却使人产生一些联想。
    俗话说，“人心齐，泰山移”，确是至理。60年代初，日子那么艰难，大家为什么可以保持那么一股子干劲，跟定共产党走？说到底是气顺、心齐，困难再大也难不倒我们。反之，如果气不顺、心不齐，疙疙瘩瘩，不要说克服困难，就是在顺利的时候也难免滋出些事来。
    这些年，我们国家的改革和四化建设取得很大成就，老百姓是满意的。但另一方面，也毋庸讳言，人心却不那么顺了，甚至有些散了。这中间主要原因是：由于资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥，把人们的思想搞乱了。此外，也还有两个原因：一是存在腐败现象，二是分配不公，这两件事关乎老百姓切身利益，本应引起重视，但可惜抓得不力。因而一说起这些事来，老百姓就有些气不顺。
    最近党和政府做的几件事是很得民心的，如取消特供，整顿5大公司，一时成为群众热烈谈论的话题。事情的意义不仅在于它本身，更主要的是表明了党和政府的决心，从而顺乎人心，使人心大振。这是最可喜的。愿各级领导干部多做一些理顺人心的工作，化解矛盾，疏通渠道，增强凝聚力。这样，再大的风浪也不可怕。
