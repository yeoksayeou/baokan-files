    Xinjiang Redeems "White Receipts" for Herdsmen

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, November 18th: Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has recently taken measures to redeem the "white receipts" issued to herdsmen during the purchase of wool.

    This year, Xinjiang's livestock end-of-year inventory reached a historical high, with the production of wool, hides, meat, and other livestock products all showing significant increases compared to the previous year. Previously, due to financial constraints, the purchasing departments issued a large number of "white receipts" to herdsmen.

    The People's Bank of China's Xinjiang branch has allocated special loans to redeem the "white receipts."

    新疆给牧民兑现“白条”
    据新华社乌鲁木齐11月18日电　新疆维吾尔自治区最近采取措施给牧民兑现收购羊毛时打的“白条子”。
    今年，新疆牲畜年末存栏头数创历史最好水平，羊毛、皮张、肉类等畜产品的产量均比上年有较大幅度增长。前一时期收购部门因资金紧张，向牧民打“白条”现象严重。
    中国人民银行新疆分行已安排专项贷款，用于兑现“白条子”。
