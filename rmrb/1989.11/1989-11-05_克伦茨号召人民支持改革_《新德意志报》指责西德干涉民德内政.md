Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 4th.

East German leader Krenz delivered a nationwide broadcast and television address last night, calling on the nation to support the party's reform policies and work together to address current issues. Through comprehensive reform and innovation, the socialist construction of the GDR will be improved.

Krenz pointed out that with the convening of the 9th Central Committee Plenum of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the GDR has entered a new stage of development. The GDR will innovate in politics, economy, and society and will not reverse course.

However, Krenz emphasized that it is not permissible to denigrate the history of the GDR over the past 40 years and the great achievements made by the entire nation. These are the foundations of the republic. Necessary innovations in our socialist society can only be carried out on the basis of what we have all created together.

Krenz said that the work of innovation cannot stop. He reported to the nation some key points of the draft action program formulated by the Politburo under his chairmanship yesterday: to carry out political system reforms to ensure that the people fully exercise their rights; to establish a constitutional court to safeguard the implementation of the constitution; to reform the management system and carry out extensive economic reforms, and to make fundamental adjustments to economic policies; to take emergency measures to improve market supply; to carry out educational reforms to better cultivate talents for socialism; to implement a compensatory service system for those who refuse military service, etc. This draft will be submitted to the 10th Central Committee Plenum for deliberation.

Krenz pointed out that in party life, it is necessary to create guarantees that make innovation irreversible. The democratization of cadre policies and the regulation of cadre terms of office are indispensable.

He announced that Comrades H. Aksen, K. Hager, E. Mielke, E. Mickelberg, and A. Neumann have voluntarily proposed to the Central Committee to relieve them of their duties as members of the Politburo, making way for younger comrades.

Regarding the Free Democratic Party's proposal to hold a People's Assembly to elect a new chairman and to demand the government's resignation, Krenz said that this issue should be decided by the highest representative body of the people. He stressed the need to adhere to the principle: "For more and better socialism, more democracy."

Krenz finally called on all citizens of the GDR to unite, safeguard the values created over the decades, and gradually renew the social face of the GDR.

It is also reported that the district secretaries of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Ziegenhahn of Gera and Albrecht of Suhl, have resigned. Margot Honecker, the Minister of National Education, has also requested to resign from her post "for political reasons." The former head of the trade unions in the GDR and chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation, Tisch, has also resigned.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 3rd.

The East German newspaper *Neues Deutschland* published a commentary on November 3rd, stating that West Germany's interference in East German internal affairs is not permissible.

The commentary pointed out that some politicians in West Germany always interfere in the social construction of the GDR. According to the recent remarks of the chairman of the Social Democratic Party of West Germany, Vogel, "the highest leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany should take important steps towards political pluralism," that is, to implement so-called freedom of travel, news, and speech, and to recognize the legal status of organizations like the Social Democratic Party, as well as to abolish the leading role of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

The commentary reaffirmed that the constitution of the GDR clearly stipulates the leading role of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, which no one can deny.

    克伦茨号召人民支持改革
    《新德意志报》指责西德干涉民德内政
    本报柏林11月4日电　记者许宏治报道：民主德国领导人克伦茨昨天晚上对全国发表广播电视讲话，号召全国人民支持党的革新政策，共同努力解决当前问题，通过全面革新和改革，把民德的社会主义建设得更好。
    克伦茨指出，随着德国统一社会党9中全会的召开，民主德国发展到了一个崭新的阶段。民德将在政治、经济、社会各方面进行革新，决不走回头路。
    但克伦茨强调，决不允许贬低民德40年来的历史和全国人民共同取得的伟大成就，这些是共和国的基础。而我们社会主义社会必要的革新只能在大家共同创造的基础上才有可能进行。
    克伦茨说，革新的工作不能停顿。他向全国公民通报了昨天中央政治局在他主持下制定的行动纲领草案的一些要点：进行政治体制改革，以保证人民充分行使权力；成立宪法法庭，以维护宪法的实施；进行管理体制的改革和广泛的经济改革，对经济政策作出原则的修改；采取紧急措施，以改善市场供应；进行教育改革，更好地为社会主义培养人才；对拒服兵役者实行补偿性勤务制，等等。这一草案将提交即将召开的10中全会审议。
    克伦茨指出，在党的生活中，党的结构和状况中必须创造使革新不可逆转的保证。干部政策的民主化和规定干部任职期限是不可缺少的。
    他宣布，赫·阿克森、库·哈格、埃·米尔克、埃·米肯贝格尔和阿·诺伊曼等5位同志主动向中央委员会建议，免去他们政治局委员的职务，把位置让给更年轻的同志。
    关于自由民主党提出的要求举行人民议院会议选举新的人民议院主席和要求政府辞职的建议，克伦茨说，这个问题要由最高人民代表机构来决定。他强调要遵循这样的格言：“为了更多、更好的社会主义而实行更多的民主”。
    克伦茨最后号召民德全体公民团结起来，维护几十年来所创造的价值，一步一步地使民德社会面貌一新。
    另据报道，德国统一社会党格拉专区书记齐根哈恩和苏尔专区书记阿尔布雷希特已经辞职。昂纳克夫人、国民教育部长马戈特·昂纳克“由于政治方面的原因”也请求辞去她的职务。原民主德国工会负责人、自由德国工会联合会主席蒂施已经辞职。
    新华社柏林11月3日电　民主德国《新德意志报》3日发表评论指出，决不允许联邦德国干涉民主德国的内政。
    评论指出，联邦德国的某些政界人士总是指手划脚，干涉民主德国的社会建设。按照联邦德国社会民主党主席福格尔最近的说法，“德国统一社会党最高领导层应该采取向政治多元化过渡的重要步骤”，也就是说，要实行所谓的旅行、新闻和言论自由，并承认像社会民主党这类组织的合法地位以及取消德国统一社会党的领导作用。
    评论重申，民主德国宪法中明确规定德国统一社会党的领导作用，这是任何人也不能够否定的。
