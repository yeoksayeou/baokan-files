Sending young and middle-aged cadres to the grassroots for training in batches has become an established practice at the Ministry of Agriculture. So far, over the past seven years, six batches totaling more than 500 cadres have been sent to the grassroots. This has played a positive role in improving the quality of the cadre team, reforming the style of work in the departments, and strengthening communication between higher and lower levels.

The Ministry of Agriculture began this practice in 1983, deliberately selecting different types of regions with a certain degree of representativeness as bases for cadres to go to the grassroots for training. These bases include economically developed areas, as well as nationally designated poverty-stricken areas and minority regions. Going to these regions for training allows cadres to gain a more comprehensive and extensive understanding of rural conditions, providing a basis for formulating agricultural policies.

These cadres generally hold certain positions at the grassroots level, actively participate in and cooperate with local work, and complete the investigation and research tasks assigned by the Ministry of Agriculture. They timely reflect new situations and problems in rural areas and pay attention to summarizing new experiences from rural reforms.

Over the past seven years, batches of cadres sent by the Ministry of Agriculture to the grassroots for training have "gone with a purpose and returned with gains." They have deepened their understanding of rural areas, agriculture, and farmers, improved their policy level and work abilities, and assisted local areas in formulating some medium and short-term plans. They have supported the establishment of hundreds of production projects in local areas, enhancing their sense of responsibility to serve the grassroots and farmers.

    农业部中青年干部下基层锻炼成制度
    本报讯　记者江夏报道：分期分批派中青年干部下基层锻炼，在农业部已成为一种制度。到目前为止，已连续7年派出6批共500多名干部下基层，这对提高干部队伍素质、改进机关作风、沟通上下联系起了积极作用。
    农业部从1983年开始，有目的地选择了不同类型、具有一定代表性的地区作为干部蹲点锻炼的基地。这些基地有的经济比较发达，有的则是全国重点贫困地区或少数民族地区。在这些地区蹲点，有利于干部比较全面、广泛地掌握农村的情况，为制定农业政策提供依据。
    这些干部在基层一般担任一定的职务，积极参与和配合地方开展工作，同时完成农业部交给的调查研究任务，及时反映农村新情况和新问题，注意总结农村改革的新经验。
    7年来，农业部一批批下基层锻炼的干部，“有所求而去，有所获而归”，加深了对农村、农业和农民的了解，提高了政策水平和工作能力，同时协助地方制定了一些中短期规划，扶持地方建了成百个生产项目，增强了为基层服务、为农民服务的责任感。
