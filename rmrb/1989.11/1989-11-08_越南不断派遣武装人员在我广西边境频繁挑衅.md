In recent times, Vietnam has repeatedly sent armed personnel to provoke along the Guangxi border, destroying boundary markers and firing into our territory, seriously disrupting the production and life of our border residents.

According to statistics from relevant departments of the Guangxi border defense, since August, Vietnamese armed personnel have invaded the territory of Jingxi County in Guangxi, shooting and injuring or abducting more than 10 of our border residents, and looting the property of our border residents nearly 200 times. On the morning of November 6th, at 9 AM, 2 Vietnamese soldiers invaded the Qilong area of Jingxi County in Guangxi, attacking our border residents. Our border defense militia squad immediately opened fire on the enemy, killing the invading Vietnamese soldiers.
