In the process of deepening rural reforms, how can the household contract responsibility system be further stabilized and developed? Yunnan Province's approach is to establish and improve various socialized production service systems, providing farmers with pre-production, in-production, and post-production services, and solving problems that individual households cannot handle or handle poorly. Based on practices in various parts of Yunnan, their socialized production services include four aspects:

	—Establishment of a management service system for public facilities and property. Led by township (town) agricultural economic, agricultural machinery, and water conservancy management stations, a series of services are provided. Since 1984, out of 128 counties (cities) in Yunnan Province, 94 counties have established over 3,500 township and village agricultural economic service stations. These stations have carefully audited collective funds and property, recovering 10.8 billion yuan in overdue payments from farmers to the collective, which has been used for agricultural water conservancy construction and various public welfare projects. In terms of agricultural machinery services, the province has established 819 agricultural machinery management service stations, transforming from a single mechanized farming operation model to a comprehensive service model that includes management, supply, maintenance, and promotion. The province's mechanized farming area has increased from 5.5 million mu in 1984 to 8.24 million mu.

	—Establishment of a rural science and technology service system. To meet the needs of developing grain and advantageous economic crops, the province has initially formed a rural science and technology promotion network with the province and prefectures as guides, counties as hubs, townships (towns) as backbones, villages as bases, and science and technology households as bridges. In the province's more than 13,000 administrative villages, most have appointed agricultural technical personnel who mainly engage in planting. At the same time, 60% of the townships (towns) have established 957 science popularization associations. The widespread science and technology contracting in various places has also achieved very significant results.

	—Establishment of an agricultural production materials service system. Various levels of supply and marketing cooperatives in the province have taken the comprehensive service of agricultural production materials as an important part of the system reform, forming a comprehensive service system from organizing supplies, transportation, sales to technical guidance. At the same time, a comprehensive service network has been established from the top down, with the provincial agricultural materials company as the leader, prefecture and county companies as the backbone, and grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives as the base, jointly organizing the supply of fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural films, directly serving the farmers.

	—Establishment of an agricultural product circulation service system. Since the reform of the mandatory procurement system for agricultural products in 1985, Yunnan Province has, while fully leveraging the role of state-owned commercial and transportation departments, vigorously supported cooperative economic organizations and individual transporters to enter the circulation. In rural areas across the province, a circulation service system has been formed with state-owned, collective, and individual entities, with products as the leader.

　　云南农村建起四大服务体系
    在深化农村改革中，如何使家庭联产承包责任制继续得到稳定和发展呢？云南省的做法是，建立健全各种社会化生产服务体系，为农民提供产前、产中和产后服务，解决好一家一户办不了和办不好的事情。根据云南各地实践，他们的社会化生产服务包括四个方面：
    ——建立了公共设施和财产的经营管理服务体系。以乡（镇）农经、农机、水利管理站为主开展系列化服务。1984年以来，云南省的128个县（市）中，已有94个县建立了乡、村农经服务站3500多个，对集体的资金财产进行了认真清理，收回历年农民超欠集体款108亿元，用于农田水利建设和各项公益事业。在农机服务方面，全省共建立了819个农机管理服务站，由过去单纯机耕作业经营型改为管理、供应、维修、推广综合服务型。全省机耕面积从1984年的550万亩上升到824万亩。
    ——建立了农村科技服务体系。为适应发展粮食和优势经济作物的需要，全省农村初步形成以省、地为指导，县为中枢，乡（镇）为骨干，村为基础，科技户为桥梁的农村科技推广网络。全省1.3万多个行政村，多数配备了以从事种植业为主的农民技术员。同时全省有60％的乡（镇）建立科普协会957个。各地广泛开展的科技承包也取得十分明显的效果。
    ——建立了农业生产资料服务体系。全省各级供销社把搞好农资系列化服务作为体制改革的重要内容，形成从组织货源、运输、销售到技术指导的系列化服务体系。同时，建立了由省农资公司牵头，地县公司为依托，基层供销社为基础，从上到下的系列化服务网络，共同组织化肥、农药、农膜的供应，直接为农民服务。
    ——建立了农产品流通服务体系。自1985年改革农产品统派购制度以来，云南省对烟、糖、茶、菜籽大宗优势产品，在充分发挥国营商业、运输部门作用的同时，大力扶持合作经济组织和个体运输户进入流通。在全省农村形成了以产品为龙头的国营、集体和个体的流通服务体系。
