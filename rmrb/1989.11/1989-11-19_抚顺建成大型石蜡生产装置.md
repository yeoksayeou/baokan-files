Fushun Completes Large-Scale Paraffin Production Facility

	The People's Daily, Shenyang, November 18 - By the end of October, China's paraffin production base, Fushun Petroleum Refinery, completed the construction of a large-scale solvent dewaxing unit with an annual production capacity of 84,000 tons of paraffin and began production.

	The paraffin produced by Fushun Petroleum Refinery is popular in both international and domestic markets and is known as the "second gold." To increase paraffin production and expand exports to earn foreign exchange, the refinery invested 40 million yuan. It adopted a compensation trade method to import key equipment from the United States and purchased advanced domestic equipment to complement it. After an 8-month struggle, the project was completed and put into production half a year ahead of schedule.
