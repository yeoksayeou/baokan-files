Wang Zhen and some Red Army veterans gathered warmly to recall the glorious combat history of the Second Front Army. They emphasized the need to compile a good war history to strengthen the military's construction and educate revolutionary successors.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 13 - (Reporter He Ping) Vice President Wang Zhen met with members of the editorial committee for the war history of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army Second Front Army this morning in Zhongnanhai. He said that the Second Front Army and its predecessor, the Second and Sixth Corps, made significant contributions to the victory of the Chinese revolution. The glorious combat history of the Second Front Army is an important part of the history of our Party and our military. Summarizing the glorious history, struggle experience, and heroic deeds of this army is of great significance for inheriting and carrying forward the glorious traditions of our Party and our military, strengthening the revolutionary, modern, and regular construction of our military, and educating the younger generation and comforting the departed comrades.

The veteran comrades of the Second Front Army who participated in today's meeting include: Standing Committee members of the Central Advisory Commission Xiao Ke and Yu Qiu Li, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Liao Han Sheng, and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Wang En Mao.

The Second Front Army was one of the three main forces of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, composed of the Second and Sixth Corps and the 32nd Army. Under the leadership of comrades He Long, Ren Bishi, Guan Xiangying, Xiao Ke, and Wang Zhen, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the Second and Sixth Corps set out from the Hunan-Hubei-Hunan-Guizhou Revolutionary Base in November 1935, breaking through layer upon layer of blockades, covering a distance of more than 20,000 li, and arrived in northern Shaanxi in November 1936. They successfully joined forces with the First and Fourth Front Armies, creating a new situation for the Chinese revolution. Due to the limitations of historical conditions at that time, the original draft of the war history of the Second Front Army was not ideal. In November 1987, the Central Military Commission approved the establishment of the editorial committee for the war history of the Second Front Army to revise and supplement the original draft.

Today, these Red Army veterans, who have fought for the liberation of the Chinese people for decades, gathered warmly to recall the glorious and heroic history of the Second Front Army, to commemorate the departed and fallen comrades, and to express their determination to resolutely implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, to closely unite around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, to adhere to the four cardinal principles, and to adhere to reform and opening up.

    王震和一些红军老战士亲切相聚  共同追忆二方面军光辉战斗历程
    要求编好战史加强我军建设教育革命后代
    新华社北京11月13日电 （记者何平）国家副主席王震今天上午在中南海会见中国工农红军第二方面军战史编辑委员会的工作人员。他说，红二方面军及其前身红二、六军团为中国革命的胜利做出了重大贡献。红二方面军的光辉战斗历程，是我党我军历史的重要组成部分。将这支部队的光荣历史、斗争经验以及可歌可泣的事迹总结出来，对于继承和发扬我党我军的光荣传统，加强我军革命化、现代化、正规化建设，教育后代和慰藉已故的同志，都具有重要的意义。
    参加今天会见的红二方面军老同志还有：中顾委常委肖克、余秋里，全国人大常委会副委员长廖汉生，全国政协副主席王恩茂等。
    红二方面军是中国工农红军三大主力之一，由红二、六军团、红32军组成。红二、六军团广大指战员在贺龙、任弼时、关向应、肖克、王震同志领导下，1935年11月从湘鄂川黔革命根据地出发，冲破层层封锁，行程两万余里，1936年11月到达陕北，与红一、四方面军胜利会师，开创了中国革命的新局面。由于过去历史条件的限制，原有的红二方面军战史初稿写得不够理想，1987年11月，中央军委批准成立了红二方面军战史编委会，在原初稿基础上进行了修改和充实。
    今天，这些为中国人民的解放事业浴血奋战几十年的红军老战士亲切相聚，共同追忆红二方面军可歌可泣的光辉历程，缅怀已故和牺牲的战友，表示要坚决贯彻执行党的十三届五中全会精神，紧密地团结在以江泽民总书记为核心的党中央周围，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放。
