	Strongly Oppose and Condemn "Taiwan Independence" Activities
	Hóu Jìngrú Calls on Huangpu Alumni to Fulfill Their Duties for National Unification

	BEIJING, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) — Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association Chairman Hóu Jìngrú today called on alumni from both sides of the Taiwan Strait to join hands, uphold the banner of patriotism, and fulfill their duties for national unification, ethnic unity, and the revival of China.

	The Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association held an expanded meeting of its council today. More than 20 council members from both sides of the Taiwan Strait attended the meeting. Alumni from the "Military Academy Alumni Association" in Taiwan also participated.

	Hóu Jìngrú, 85, is a first-year student of the Huangpu Military Academy and currently serves as Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In his report, he strongly criticized the separatist activities of a small group of "Taiwan independence" elements. He pointed out that in recent years, with the joint efforts of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the relationship between the two sides has undergone a gratifying change. However, the authorities in Taiwan have persisted in their anti-communist and anti-unification stance, promoting separatism, and vigorously peddling "flexible diplomacy" and "dual recognition," attempting to turn Taiwan into an independent state in reality. The actions of the Taiwan authorities have contradicted their repeated declarations of "adhering to one China." Notably, in recent periods, the activities of "Taiwan independence" elements have become more open, more rampant, and more unrestrained in their efforts to split the motherland. They openly propose so-called "new constitutions" and "new states," and madly advocate for "Taiwan independence," which has been strongly opposed and condemned by Huangpu alumni and their families on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.

	Hóu Jìngrú expressed his willingness to exchange views with the "Military Academy Alumni Association" in Taiwan on promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

　　强烈反对和谴责“台独”活动
　　侯镜如呼吁黄埔同学为祖国统一恪尽职责
    本报北京11月28日讯　记者张志业报道：黄埔军校同学会会长侯镜如今天在此间呼吁：海内外黄埔同学共同携手，高举爱国主义大旗，为祖国统一、民族团结、中华振兴恪尽职责。
    黄埔军校同学会今天举行理事会扩大会议。来自海内外的20多位理事出席了会议。台湾“军事院校校友会”的同学也参加了会议。
    今年85岁的侯镜如是黄埔军校一期学生，现为全国政协副主席。他在报告中强烈抨击了一小撮“台独”分子的分裂活动。他指出，几年来，经过两岸人民的协力推动，两岸关系发生了可喜的变化。但是，台湾当局至今仍顽固坚持反共拒和立场，推行分离主义，大肆兜售“弹性外交”，搞“双重承认”，妄图把台湾变成实际上的“独立”国家。台湾当局的所作所为，违背了多年来他们一再宣称的“坚持一个中国”的立场。值得注意的是，最近一个时期来，“台独”分子的活动更加公开，更加猖狂，更加肆无忌惮地进行分裂祖国的活动。他们公然提出所谓“新宪法”、“新国家”，疯狂叫嚷
  “台湾独立”，遭到两岸黄埔师生及其家属的强烈反对和谴责。
    侯镜如表示，愿意和台湾“军事院校校友会”就促进祖国和平统一问题交换意见。
