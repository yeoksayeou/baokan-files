Xinhua News Agency, November 24th, 17:30, a serious tunnel collapse occurred at the Datai Coal Mine in the western mountains of Beijing. 15 miners working in the mine were trapped approximately 7 kilometers from the surface exit and 350 meters deep in the working face, facing severe threats to their lives...

By 20:50 on November 25th, these 15 miners who had been trapped underground for over 27 hours were all safely evacuated to the surface. The entire rescue operation resulted in no injuries or fatalities.

This is another hymn of praise to communism written by our society.

Around 17:00 on the 25th, after learning that 15 miners at Datai Mine were trapped underground, the reporter immediately drove to the scene. Unexpectedly, Beijing Municipal Party Committee Standing Committee member and Secretary General Yuan Liben, Vice Mayor Wu Yi, Municipal Government Secretary General Tie Ying, and leaders from the Municipal Health Bureau, Economic Commission, Public Security Bureau, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, totaling more than 30 people, had already arrived at the scene at 17:45, ahead of the reporter.

The first government body to receive the news of the collapse at Datai Mine was the Municipal Labor Bureau. Bureau Chief Gong Shujin and Deputy Chief Wang Jianlun rushed to Datai Mine to assess the situation and immediately returned to Beijing to report to the Municipal Party Committee. Municipal Party Secretary Li Xicheng and Mayor Chen Xitong were presiding over a meeting of the Secretariat when they immediately interrupted the meeting to receive the report and deploy rescue efforts. They demanded: "All efforts must be made to rescue the miners and ensure their safety."

Datai Mine's Chief Engineer Jin Daren introduced the accident to the reporter. At 17:30 on the 24th, the 19 miners of the 12th mining team, led by Bao Xianyou, were mining at the 473 working face when a sudden tunnel collapse blocked the passage to the surface exit. 15 miners were trapped inside and unable to escape.

The mine's dispatch center received the report at 19:39. Mine Director Ni Wenju immediately assembled a rescue team from various departments and sections and rushed to the accident site. At the same time, he urgently called Beijing Mining Bureau Director Liu Shaokun, who was on-site at the Datai Mine guesthouse. Liu Shaokun was preparing to take a shower when he received the report. Without hesitation, he rushed to the scene barefoot, wearing only his shoes. He remained underground directing the rescue efforts until all 15 miners were saved, spending over 20 hours without food or rest.

When Yuan Liben and Wu Yi arrived at Datai Mine, the rescue efforts were still in full swing. They carefully inquired about the progress of the rescue work and conveyed the greetings of Li Xicheng, Chen Xitong, and others to all the rescue team members. At 20:05, the news from underground was heartening: a new passage had been opened, and all 15 miners had been safely evacuated from the accident site.

The 31 rescue team members from Mucun Valley Mine and Wangping Village Mine performed admirably. After the collapse, a new passage had to be opened to rescue the miners. Due to the soft coal layers and insufficient technical expertise, another collapse occurred while opening the new passage. The only hope was to open a vertical passage—an upright shaft—between the two collapse points. However, this plan was extremely challenging and beyond the capabilities of Datai Mine alone. Upon receiving the call for assistance, the nearby Mucun Valley and Wangping Village coal mines immediately dispatched experienced Deputy Mine Directors Chen Changshun, Meng Zhaoying, Dispatch Center Directors Jia Jingxian, and Liu Liansheng, along with 31 other team members, to Datai Mine in the early hours of the 25th. They completed a 12-meter-high upright shaft in just 14 hours, a task that would typically take at least two days under normal circumstances. The 15 miners were rescued through this upright shaft.

The news spread, and Yuan Liben, Deputy Director of the Municipal Economic Commission Li Jikai, and others, led by Beijing Mining Bureau Party Committee Deputy Secretary Zhang Fengchao and Datai Mine Trade Union Chairman Wang Baoyi, immediately changed into mining gear, donned helmets, and rushed to the 300-meter-deep underground to welcome the miners. At the mine's exit, Wu Yi, Tie Ying, and hundreds of cadres and masses were prepared for rescue and reception.

At 20:50 on the 25th, the iron door of the mine's exit opened, and the 15 exhausted miners, escorted by the rescue team, stepped out of the elevator. Wu Yi and Tie Ying rushed forward to shake their hands warmly: "Well done, you've worked hard!" The miners, who had narrowly escaped death, gripped the hot hands of their rescuers, tears welling up in their eyes. They were then escorted to the Datai Mine staff hospital for medical examination, oxygen supply, and observation.

Around 22:00, Yuan Liben, Wu Yi, and others visited the 15 miners receiving oxygen treatment at the Datai staff hospital, as well as the medical staff. According to a staff member from the Beijing Mining Bureau General Hospital, these 15 miners, except for one with mild dehydration, were in good condition and would recover within 24 hours.

These 15 miners were mostly migrant workers from Hebei and Sichuan, aged between 20 and 30. Pan Yanzhong, a 22-year-old from Hebei, told the reporter: "When trapped underground, I felt quite desperate. Once outside, I never expected so many leaders to care about our safety. It's truly great to be in a socialist society, and the Communist Party is wonderful."

　　十五名矿工脱险记
　　新华社记者　刘浦泉
    11月24日17时30分，位于北京西部山区的北京矿务局大台煤矿发生了一起严重巷道塌冒事故。15名正在采掘的矿工被困在距离地面出口约7公里、深350米的工作面上，生命安全面临着严重威胁……
    到11月25日20时50分，这些被困在井下27个多小时的矿工已全部撤回地面。整个抢救中无一人伤亡。
    这是我们这个社会谱写的又一曲共产主义赞歌。
    25日17时左右，记者在得知大台矿15名矿工被困井下的消息后，立即驱车赶赴出事地点。没想到，北京市委常委、秘书长袁立本，副市长吴仪，市政府秘书长铁英，以及市卫生局、经委、公安局、总工会等有关部门的领导30多人，已比记者抢先一步于17时45分到达现场。
    市里最先得到大台矿发生塌冒消息的是市劳动局。局长龚树基、副局长王建伦等在专程赶到大台矿了解情况后，迅即驱车回京向市委汇报。正在主持召开书记办公会议的市委书记李锡铭和市长陈希同，当即中断会议，听取汇报，部署抢救工作。他们要求：一定要全力抢救，确保井下矿工的生命安全。
    大台矿总工程师金达仁向记者介绍了事故发生的情况。24日17时30分，由包献有带队的采掘12组的19名矿友，正在井下473工作面采掘时，突然发生巷道塌冒，堵住了通往地面出口的通道。其中15人被堵在里面，不能出来。
    矿调度值班室19时39分接到报告，矿长倪文驹立即从各科室和工段抽调人员组成抢险队，奔赴事故现场。同时，急忙打电话给正在大台矿现场办公的北京矿务局局长刘少昆。刘少昆当时正在矿招待所里休息，脱了袜子准备洗洗，听了报告后二话没说，光着脚丫穿上皮鞋直奔现场。他一直在井下指挥抢救，直到救出15名矿工才回到地面，20多个小时没吃没喝。
    在袁立本、吴仪等同志赶到大台矿时，抢救仍在紧张进行。他们仔细询问了抢救工作的进展情况，并转达了李锡铭、陈希同等同志对全体抢险队员的问候。20时5分，从井下传来了振奋人心的消息，新的通道已经开通，15名矿工已全部脱离事故现场。
    木城涧矿和王平村矿的31名救援队员立了大功。在塌冒后需开辟新通道救人，由于煤层松软和技术力量不足，在开辟新通道时又出现了新的塌冒。唯一的希望只有在两处塌冒点之间开辟一个垂直通道——立眼。但这个方案难度极大，靠大台矿的力量是难以完成的。附近的木城涧和王平村两个煤矿接到救援电话以后，立即派出富有经验的副矿长陈长顺、孟昭英、调度室主任贾敬贤、刘连生等31人组成的救援队于25日凌晨赶赴大台矿。他们仅用14个小时就开通了一个12米高的立眼。而按常规，最快也得两天。15名矿工就是从这个立眼中获救的。
    消息传出，袁立本、市经委副主任李冀凯等在北京矿务局党委副书记张凤朝、大台矿工会主席王宝义等带领下，立即换上矿工服，带上头盔，直奔300多米深处的井下迎接。地井出口处，吴仪、铁英等数百干部群众作好了抢救和迎接的准备工作。
    25日20时50分，地井口的铁门开了，15名拖着困乏身子的矿工在抢救人员的护送下走出了电梯。吴仪、铁英等同志抢上前去，亲切地与他们握手：“好样的，辛苦了！”死里逃生的矿工们握着一双双滚烫的手，热泪盈眶。随后，他们被护送到大台矿职工医院接受体检、输氧和观察治疗。
    大约22时，袁立本、吴仪等到大台职工医院看望和慰问了正在输氧的15名矿工以及医护人员。据北京矿务局职工总医院的一位同志介绍，这15名矿工，除1人轻度脱水外，其他人员情况良好，24小时后即可恢复正常。
    这15名矿工，大都是来自河北、四川等地的农民轮换工，年龄在20至30岁之间。今年22岁的来自河北的潘彦龙对记者说：“困在井底时，我真感到有些绝望。一到外边，没想到有那么多领导在关心着我们的生命安危。真是社会主义好，共产党好。”
