The Dabie Mountains have a new development: the aroma of citrus fills the air. In mid-October, Zhou Li, the vice-chairman of the National Citrus Association and deputy researcher at the Hubei Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences Fruit and Tea Research Institute, visited Yingshan and Luotian counties for an on-site inspection. When she saw the vast citrus orchards in Yangliuwan Town, Yingshan County, laden with fruits, she joyfully said: This is another breakthrough in the "citrus prohibition zone" of the Dabie Mountains, proving that the experts' proposition that "there are many small climate zones suitable for citrus cultivation on the southern slopes of the Dabie Mountains" is correct.

After nearly 8 years of observation and research, experts found that there is a relatively "warm zone" (altitude 300-500 meters) on the southern slopes of the Dabie Mountains in eastern Hubei, with many small climate zones suitable for citrus cultivation. The Dabie Mountains in eastern Hubei are located in the mid-latitudes, with complex terrain and significant differences in natural conditions. In the past, it was long considered the northern limit for citrus development, with no successful examples of large-scale citrus orchards. In 1984, Yangliuwan Town, Yingshan County, developed more than 60 mu of large-scale citrus orchards, but the trees only grew and did not bear fruit. This year, after repeatedly inviting experts and technicians for guidance and implementing scientific management, the 40-plus mu of citrus that entered production yielded nearly 20,000 kilograms of fruit. Additionally, on the southern side of the main peak of the Dabie Mountains, the Tian Tang Fourth-Level Power Station in Luotian County, located at an altitude of over 200 meters, yielded over 1,000 kilograms per mu from the 4 mu of citrus planted in 1985. Several experts who have long been engaged in citrus production and research believe that the main reason for the past failure of large-scale citrus cultivation in the Dabie Mountains is the lack of technology. They emphasize that the Dabie Mountains have great potential for citrus production, but not all places are suitable for development. It is necessary to conduct typical demonstrations and gradually promote them. Specifically, it is important to adhere to the principle of suitability, selecting north-facing, south-facing, windward, sunny, and water-rich small climate zones for orchard development, cultivating cold-resistant excellent varieties, minimizing low-temperature frost damage, and striving for early, high, and stable yields.

    大别山区柑桔香
    何安林　余安化
    大别山区新鲜事，柑桔飘香沁心脾。10月中旬，全国柑桔协会副理事长、湖北省农科院果茶研究所副研究员周绂到英山、罗田县实地考察，当她看到英山县杨柳湾镇成片桔园挂满累累硕果时，欣喜地说：这是对大别山“柑桔禁区”的又一次突破，证实有关专家提出的“大别山南坡有很多适宜柑桔栽培的小气候区”的论断是正确的。
    有关专家经过近8年的观测研究，发现在鄂东大别山南坡有一相对“暖带”存在（海拔300—500米），其中有很多适宜柑桔栽培的小气候区。鄂东大别山区位于中纬地带，地貌复杂，自然条件差异较大，过去长期被认为是发展柑桔的北缘地区，没有成片桔园获得成功的实证。英山县杨柳湾镇1984年发展的60多亩成片桔园，只长树，不挂果。今年，多次请来专家和技术员作指导，实行科学管理，投产的40多亩柑桔采摘了近两万公斤果实。此外，大别山主峰南侧的罗田天堂四级电站，位于海拔200多米处，1985年栽种的4亩柑桔，今年亩产达到1000多公斤。几位长期从事柑桔生产和研究的专家认为，过去大别山腹地种植成片柑桔没有成功的原因，主要是缺乏技术。他们强调，大别山区发展柑桔生产潜力很大，但并非所有地方都能发展。一定要经过典型示范，逐步推广。具体说来，要坚持因地制宜，选择坐北朝南、背风向阳、水源充足的小气候区建园，发展耐寒能力强的优良品种，尽力减少低温冻害损失，力争做到早产、高产、稳产。
