Guigang City Supply and Marketing Cooperative "Ties the Knot" with Farmers, "Community of Interests" Benefits Both Sides

    XINHUA, Nanning, Nov. 13 — The Guigang City Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Guangxi has formed a "community of interests" with farmers. With the support of the cooperative, farmers have developed diversified operations, and their incomes have increased year by year. The cooperative's performance has also improved annually.

    After forming the "community of interests" with farmers, the Guigang Supply and Marketing Cooperative has always prioritized farmers' interests, harmoniously integrating the farmers' immediate benefits with the cooperative's long-term interests. Several townships in Guigang City are suitable for tea production, but due to the lack of tea factories, tea leaves were often unsold. The cooperative invested over 1.5 million yuan to establish nine tea factories, enabling farmers to earn over 2 million yuan annually from tea cultivation. In recent years, the Guigang City Supply and Marketing Cooperative has allocated over 900,000 yuan in special funds to support farmers in developing their production.

    贵港市供销社与农民“结亲”
    “利益共同体”双方受益
    本报南宁11月13日电　广西贵港市供销社与农民结成“利益共同体”，农民在供销社的扶持下开展多种经营，收入连年增加，供销社的效益一年胜过一年。
  贵港供销社在与农民结成“利益共同体”后，处处着眼于农民利益，把实现农民的眼前利益与供销社的长远利益有机地统一起来。贵港市有几个乡镇适宜发展茶叶生产，但由于没有茶厂，茶叶滞销。供销社投资150万余元，办起9个茶厂，农民种茶的收入每年超过200万元。近几年，贵港市供销社共拨出专款90万多元，扶持农民发展生产。
