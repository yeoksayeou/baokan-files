Yang Shangkun Meets and Dines with Nixon

Beijing, November 1 (Reported by Ding Gang) — Tonight, Chairman Yang Shangkun met with former U.S. President Richard Nixon at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. Chairman Yang welcomed Nixon's visit to China, saying, "You are an old friend of China, and many people in China are familiar with you." Nixon replied, "I have long heard that you are a veteran of the Long March, and I am very pleased to meet you."

Mr. Nixon conveyed greetings from President Bush to Chairman Yang. Chairman Yang also asked Mr. Nixon to convey his greetings to President Bush.

When discussing Sino-American relations, Mr. Nixon said that the current stalemate should be broken and believed it could be broken.

Chairman Yang said, "We also believe that friendly relations between China and the United States should continue. We hope that Mr. Nixon's visit to China will help promote mutual understanding and be beneficial to the restoration and development of normal relations between the two sides."

After explaining the truth behind the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, Chairman Yang said that after the suppression, China's social order has become more stable, our determination to modernize has become stronger, and our established policy of reform and opening up will not be affected. We will continue to reform and continue economic cooperation and exchanges with foreign countries.

After the meeting, Chairman Yang hosted a banquet for the guests.

At the toast, Chairman Yang said, "For a long time, Mr. Nixon has respected the Chinese people and has also earned the respect of the Chinese people. The Chinese people will never forget the historical contributions Mr. Nixon has made to Sino-American relations."

Chairman Yang said, "Currently, Sino-American relations are in a very difficult period, or one could say a stalemate. This situation was not created by us. China's policy towards the United States has not changed; we are still willing to develop friendly and cooperative relations with the United States in accordance with the principles stipulated in the three Sino-American joint communiqués. China's view of the overall situation of the world has not changed; we still believe that a constructive and good Sino-American relationship is an important factor in maintaining and promoting world peace and development. Since Mr. Nixon's visit to China 17 years ago, Sino-American relations have made significant progress, and every step has been hard-won. We cherish this achievement and do not want to see it all go down the drain in a few months. China has not done anything to harm American interests, nor has it attempted to impose its views and values on the United States. What has changed is the United States. In recent months, some people in the United States have deeply involved themselves in China's internal affairs. They judge what has happened in China according to American standards. If they are not satisfied, they criticize and even impose sanctions. They have forgotten history. For more than a hundred years, the Chinese people have, through arduous struggles, finally gained the most basic rights—the independence of the nation and national dignity."

Chairman Yang said, "People's views may differ, ideas can be exchanged, and opinions can be held independently, but it is not permissible to impose one's own views on others and demand that they be accepted. This is true for personal relationships and even more so for relationships between countries. This is a principle that international relations should universally follow. I think Mr. Nixon, as a politician, will agree with this view."

Chairman Yang pointed out, "The American people are friendly towards the Chinese people, and there are still many enlightened people in the United States like Mr. Nixon. They realize that when considering relations between countries, one should mainly consider the strategic interests of the country, look at the long-term interests, not just one's own interests, but also consider the interests of the other party, without calculating historical grudges, without calculating differences in social systems, ideologies, and beliefs. China and the United States have major, long-term common interests, and the two countries will eventually come together. We hope to achieve this as soon as possible, but this does not depend solely on us. We welcome Mr. Nixon's efforts to improve Sino-American relations, and we will also respond to any positive actions taken by the American side for this purpose. Sino-American relations are now at a crossroads, and the initiative is with the American side. The current political situation in China is stable, and the third-generation leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core is united, strong, and powerful. We will unswervingly follow our own path—the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Ten years of reform and opening up have benefited our people, and the people are satisfied. These policies will not change. We have adopted a forgiving attitude towards the general students and masses who participated in marches, demonstrations, and signatures, and do not hold them responsible. Only a few who attempted to overthrow the government of the People's Republic of China are subject to necessary and varying degrees of punishment. China has so many people, and the foundation is so weak. Without a stable and united situation, nothing can be accomplished. Our policy is to seek a peaceful and stable environment both internationally and domestically, so that we can concentrate on economic construction. We do not threaten any foreign country, nor are we afraid of foreign threats. We do not interfere in the internal affairs of others, and we do not allow others to interfere in our internal affairs. I believe our cause will succeed, and China's future is bright."

Chairman Yang finally said, "Mr. Nixon's long talks with many Chinese leaders have further enhanced mutual understanding. This visit is beneficial. When Mr. Nixon first visited China, he planted a California redwood tree in Hangzhou. This is one of the oldest and tallest trees in the world. I heard that it has grown to about 30 meters tall and has already sprouted tens of thousands of seedlings growing on Chinese soil. We welcome Mr. Nixon to visit China again in the future. I believe that no matter how many storms there are, when you come again, the redwood tree you bring will definitely grow even taller and sprout even more."

Mr. Nixon said in his toast, "We meet at a critical moment in the relations between our two countries. We should not let the door, which we opened with high expectations 17 years ago, close again. The bonds between our two peoples are precious, and I believe that our two peoples can still do much to help each other. Although there are still differences between us today, I am more confident about the prospects of Sino-American relations than I was in 1972."

Nixon said, "After my first visit to China in 1972, a deep and lasting friendship began between our two countries. Today, this friendship continues. Of course, some naive observers have insisted on treating the improvement and development of our relations as a romance. In fact, we became friends because we have common interests, not because we found common interests after becoming friends. In the past, we did not come together because of friendship, and in the future, we will not stay together because of friendship, but if there is no friendship between our two peoples, there cannot be a lasting relationship between our two governments. I am convinced that in the years to come, the United States and China will ascend to new heights together. In building a better world and achieving a better life for our peoples, the two countries will find new ways to cooperate."

Mr. Nixon finally said, "Our relationship will not be smooth sailing and calm, but our relationship will continue because it must continue. These two great countries are destined to work together for themselves and for the whole world."

It is reported that Mr. Nixon will leave Beijing for his home country on November 2.

    杨尚昆会见并宴请尼克松
    宾主相信中美存在共同利益两国迟早要走到一起
    本报北京11月1日讯　记者丁刚报道：今天晚上，国家主席杨尚昆在首都宾馆会见了美国前总统尼克松。杨尚昆主席对尼克松访华表示欢迎。他说，“你是中国的老朋友，中国有许多人都熟悉你。”尼克松说：“久闻你是长征的老战士，见到你很高兴。”
    尼克松先生转达了布什总统对杨尚昆主席的问候。杨尚昆主席也请尼克松转达对布什总统的问候。
    谈到中美关系时，尼克松先生说，目前的僵局应该打破，相信也能够打破。
    杨尚昆主席说，我们也认为中美之间的友好关系应该继续下去。希望尼克松先生的这次访华将有利于增进相互了解，有益于恢复和发展双方的正常关系。
    在向客人介绍了平息北京发生的反革命暴乱事件的真相后，杨尚昆主席说，平暴后，中国的社会秩序更稳定了，我们搞现代化的决心更大了，我们既定的改革开放政策也绝不会受到影响。我们将坚持改革，继续与外国进行经济合作和交流。
    会见后，杨尚昆主席设宴招待了客人。
    杨尚昆主席在祝酒时说，长期以来，尼克松先生尊重中国人民，也得到了中国人民的尊重。中国人民将永远不会忘记尼克松先生为中美关系做出的历史性贡献。
    杨主席说，目前，中美关系处于一个十分困难的时期，也可以说是一个僵持的局面。这个局面不是我们造成的。中国对美国的政策没有变，仍然愿意按照中美间三个联合公报所规定的原则发展友好合作关系。中国对世界形势总格局的看法也没有变，仍然认为，建设性的、良好的中美关系是维持和促进世界和平与发展的重要因素。自从1972年尼克松先生访华十七年来，中美关系取得了重大进展，每一步都来之不易。我们珍惜这一成果，决不愿看到这一切在几个月之间就付诸东流。中国没有做任何伤害美国利益的事情，更没有企图把中国的看法和价值观念强加于美国。变化了的是美国。在最近几个月中，美国一些人深深卷入了中国的内部事务。他们用美国的标准判断中国所发生的事情。如果不能使他们满意，就横加指责，乃至实行制裁。他们忘记了历史，中国人民一百多年来，经过艰苦卓绝的斗争，才取得了最基本的权利——国家独立和民族尊严。
    杨主席说，人们的看法不同，思想可以交流，观点可以各自保留，但决不能允许把自己的那一套强加于对方，非要对方接受不可。个人之间的关系如此，国家之间的关系更应当如此。这正是国际关系应当普遍遵守的原则。我想尼克松先生作为一个政治家，也会同意我的这个看法。
    杨主席指出，美国人民对中国人民是友好的，美国还有不少像尼克松先生这样的有识之士。他们认识到，考虑国与国之间的关系，主要应从国家的战略利益出发，要着眼于长远利益，不仅考虑自身的利益，也要考虑对方的利益，而不去计较历史恩怨，不去计较社会制度、意识形态和思想信仰的差别。中美之间有着重大的长远的共同利益，中美两国迟早要走到一起。我们希望尽早地实现这一点，但这并不只取决于我们一方。我们欢迎尼克松先生为改善中美关系所做的努力，我们也将响应美国方面为此而采取的任何积极行动。中美关系现在处于十字路口，主动权在美国方面。当前中国的政治局势是稳定的，以江泽民总书记为核心的中国第三代领导集体是团结、坚强、有力的。我们将坚定不移地走自己的路——具有中国特色的社会主义道路。十年的改革开放政策使我们的人民得到了实惠，人民是满意的。这些政策绝对不会改变。我们对一般参与游行、示威、签名的学生和群众，都采取原谅的态度，不追究他们的责任。只对少数企图颠覆中华人民共和国政府的人进行必要的、程度不同的惩处。中国人这么多，底子这么薄，没有安定团结的局面，没有一个稳定的局势，任何事情都干不成。我们的政策是在国际国内都争取一个和平稳定的环境，使我们能集中精力搞经济建设，我们不威胁任何外国，也不怕外国的威胁。我们不干涉别人的内政，也不允许别人干涉我们的内政。我相信，我们的事业是会成功的，中国的前途是光明的。
    杨主席最后说，尼克松先生同中国许多领导人的长谈进一步增进了双方的相互了解。这一访问是有益的。尼克松先生第一次访华时在杭州种下了一棵加利福尼亚红杉树。这是世界上一种最古老、最高大的树。我听说它已长高到30来米，并且已经繁育出几万棵幼苗在中国的土地上生长。我们欢迎尼克松先生今后有机会再到中国来。我相信不论再有几番风雨，届时你带来的红杉树一定会长得更高大，繁育得更多。
    尼克松先生在祝酒时说，我们相见在我们两国关系关键的时刻。我们不应该让我们十七年前以很高的期望打开的大门重新关闭。我们两国人民之间的纽带是珍贵的，而且我认为我们两国人民在互相帮助方面仍可大有作为。尽管我们之间今天仍然存在着分歧，但我对美中关系的前景比1972年时更充满信心。
    尼克松说，1972年我第一次访华后，我们两国之间便开始了一种深厚的、持久的友谊。今天，这种友谊仍在继续。当然，有些天真的观察家曾坚持要把我们之间关系的改善发展当成一段罗曼史。而事实上，我们之所以成为朋友是因为我们有着共同的利益，并不是因为我们成了朋友才去寻找共同的利益。过去我们不是因为友谊才走在一起，今后也不会因为友谊而维持在一起，但如果我们两国人民之间没有友谊，就不可能有我们两国政府之间持久的关系。我坚信，在未来的岁月里，美中两国将共同登上新的高度。在建设一个更美好的世界和为两国人民实现更美好的生活中，两国将找到新的合作途径。
    尼克松先生最后说，我们的关系不可能是一帆风顺的和风平浪静的，但是我们的关系仍将持续下去，因为这种关系必须持续下去。我们两个如此伟大的国家是注定要为了我们自己，也为了整个世界而共同努力的。
    据悉，尼克松先生将于11月2日离开北京回国。
