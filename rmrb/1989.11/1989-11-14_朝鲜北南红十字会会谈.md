    Xinhua News Agency, Panmunjom, November 13th – (Reporter Li Nengqing) The fifth working-level meeting between the North and South Korean Red Cross representatives to discuss the second round of mutual visits by hometown visit delegations and art troupes was held today in Panmunjom. The main topic of discussion was the scale of the second round of mutual art troupes, but the two sides did not reach a consensus.

    During today's meeting, the North proposed that each art troupe should consist of 200 people; the South suggested that each art troupe should consist of 120 people. The two sides did not reach a consensus.

    After the meeting, Pak Yong-su, the head of the North Korean delegation and a standing committee member of the Central Committee of the Korean Red Cross, said at a press conference that the South Korean side did not show sincerity in today's meeting. Pak Yong-su expressed that, despite this, he remains optimistic about the realization of the second round of mutual visits by separated families and art troupes.

    He said that the originally scheduled mutual visits by hometown visit delegations and art troupes on December 8th are not far away. To reach an agreement as soon as possible, the sixth round of bilateral talks will be held on the 21st.
