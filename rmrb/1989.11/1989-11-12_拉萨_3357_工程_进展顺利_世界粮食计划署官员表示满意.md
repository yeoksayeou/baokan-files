	The "3357 Project" in Lhasa is progressing smoothly, and officials from the World Food Programme have expressed satisfaction.

	According to a report from our correspondent Lu Xiaofei in Lhasa, two officials from the World Food Programme met with Mao Rubo, Vice Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Government, and others on the afternoon of November 9. They expressed satisfaction with the smooth progress of the "3357 Project" currently being implemented in Lhasa.

	The "3357 Project" by the World Food Programme is a development and comprehensive utilization project for the Lhasa River Valley, covering four counties and one district. It began in June of this year with a total of 23 projects planned to be completed over five years. So far, six projects have been carried out, including a 1.7-kilometer northern main canal in the Chengguan District, the Caina irrigation canal, agricultural, forestry, and livestock water comprehensive utilization, and the interplanting of trees, shrubs, and grasses in Helping.

	Mr. Deshua, a senior advisor from the World Food Programme, said that over the past few months, the project executors have done a great deal of work. The organization and training preparations have been very good, and the water conservancy project design is satisfactory. The achievements in county-level management have left a deep impression. These are all better than expected. Two years ago, someone warned that it would be difficult to implement the project in Lhasa, but we are ambitious. Although there are still some difficulties, a good foundation has been laid at present. We look forward to it becoming the beginning of long-term cooperation in the future.

    拉萨“3357工程”进展顺利
    世界粮食计划署官员表示满意
    本报拉萨电　记者卢小飞报道：世界粮食计划署两名官员，11月9日下午在此间与西藏自治区人民政府副主席毛如柏等会晤时，对正在实施的拉萨“3357工程”顺利进展表示满意。
    世界粮食计划署“3357工程”是拉萨河谷4县1区的开发与综合利用工程。今年6月开始实施，总项目23个，计划5年完成。目前，已进行了城关区1.7公里北干渠、才纳灌渠、农林牧水综合利用和帮堆林草间作等6个项目。
    该署高级顾问戴斯华先生说，几个月来，项目执行者做了大量工作，组织和培训准备进行得很好，水利工程设计令人满意。县级管理方面的成绩给人留下深刻的印象。这些都比预料的要好。两年前，有人提醒说，在拉萨实施项目是不容易办到的，而我们雄心勃勃。尽管还面临一些困难，但目前已有良好的基础，我们期待它能成为将来长期合作的开端。
