Hainan Commercial Bank in Haikou is actively helping enterprises resolve their difficulties by collecting overdue payments. In the past month, the bank has helped 11 units, including the Shilu Iron Mine in Hainan, recover over 13 million yuan in overdue payments from enterprises outside the province.

To assist enterprises in clearing overdue payments from outside the province, Hainan Commercial Bank has established a special task force. In mid-October, the bank sent representatives to participate in a national conference organized by the head office of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, focusing on clearing inter-provincial and inter-city enterprise overdue payments.
