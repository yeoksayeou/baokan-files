Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 24th.

For nearly a month, the sound of brass band music has frequently echoed at the Jin Shi Tan beach in Jinzhou District, Dalian City, Liaoning Province. This is the Desheng Township Farmers' Orchestra, with 40 members, rehearsing new performances. They have been invited by Kitakyushu City, Japan, and will depart on the 25th to fly to Japan for performances. This is the first time a farmers' orchestra from China has visited abroad.

The Desheng Township Farmers' Orchestra was established in 1981, and all its members are local farmers. They do not leave their work, do not use state funds, and use their spare time to rehearse, often performing for the surrounding farmers and important meetings.

It is reported that the Desheng Township Farmers' Orchestra will also visit Fukuoka, Hiroshima, and Osaka for performances. The entire Japan tour will end in mid-December.
