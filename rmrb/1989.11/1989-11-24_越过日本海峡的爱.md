In a small courtyard of a farmer's house in Chongshan Village, Mile County, in the southern mountainous region of Yunnan Province, lives an elderly woman who does not belong to any of the local ethnic groups. Her name is Mitsurapu Meihuizi.

Mitsurapu Meihuizi was originally Japanese. In the spring of 1943, 16-year-old Meihuizi came to China's Northeast, to Jiamusi, with her parents from her hometown in Katase Town, Mishima District, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. During an air raid, Meihuizi was separated from her parents in the chaos. Later, a kind-hearted Chinese doctor took her in and introduced her to the 36th Field Hospital of the Nationalist Army, where she became a nurse.

In 1946, Jiamusi was liberated, and the People's Government took her in, issuing her a residence permit for Japanese nationals. Soon after, Meihuizi married a colleague named Zhang Lianchang. In the summer of 1947, Mitsurapu Meihuizi followed her husband back to his hometown in Mile, Yunnan. Unfortunately, they were involved in a car accident on the way, and her husband died, while she was seriously injured. Zhang Lianchang's younger brother, Zhang Lianhui, received a telegram and rushed to Kunming to handle the aftermath. Mitsurapu Meihuizi followed her brother-in-law back to her husband's home. Her mother-in-law was a kind-hearted rural woman who was very considerate of this unfortunate Japanese daughter-in-law.

Meihuizi thus settled down in a mountain village in China. Life was tough, and she, like everyone else, wore straw shoes to climb mountains and gather firewood, often ending the day with blistered and swollen feet. Seeing her suffer so much, her brother-in-law often carried a pair of soft cloth shoes, giving them to her as soon as they left the house. Meihuizi was very grateful for her brother-in-law's kindness, and gradually, they fell in love. In 1952, they got married. Seeing that the mountain people had difficulty getting medical treatment, Meihuizi studied medicine diligently. The couple became folk doctors, treating the Yi, Miao, Dai, Zhuang, and Han ethnic groups in the mountains.

A Japanese woman experienced an unusual life journey and found a home in this remote mountain village in southwest China. She had a loving husband, a beloved daughter, and harmonious relationships with the various ethnic groups in the village. She felt that life was peaceful and happy. However, soon, a large number of Japanese nationals in China were repatriated, and the county and prefecture public security bureaus also repeatedly urged her to return to Japan. Although Meihuizi always said, "I will not go to Japan; I will stay in China," her heart could no longer be at ease. She discussed with her husband and wrote an application report, sending it directly to the Ministry of Public Security and the State Council, requesting to become a Chinese citizen. When she saw the Chinese citizenship certificate with Zhou Enlai's personal signature, her hanging heart finally settled. From then on, she changed her name to Wu Huizhen in Chinese.

In May 1982, the over-50-year-old Mitsurapu Meihuizi, along with her two daughters and a young granddaughter, traveled to Japan to visit her relatives. She boarded a China-Japan Airlines flight from Shanghai, flying over the vast sea to Tokyo.

Returning to her hometown after more than 40 years of separation, Meihuizi found everything new and exciting. Her name was already engraved on the stone monument in front of the Niigata Shrine for fallen soldiers. Now, suddenly returning, the joy of her parents and relatives was indescribable.

Under the enthusiastic care of her relatives, Meihuizi lived a very comfortable life. By all accounts, Meihuizi should have been content. Her attentive mother noticed her thoughts and advised her daughter not to return to China. Meihuizi said, "That small mountain village in China has my home, my husband, my children, and my grandchildren, and the villagers who protected me. It has the well where I drink water. I must go back!"

On September 6, 1983, Meihuizi finally led her daughters and grandchild to bid farewell to her parents, brothers, and sisters in Tokyo and returned to the Chongshan Village that she had longed for. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs approved her visit duration of five years, but Meihuizi only stayed for one year.

In July 1984, Wu Huizhen was elected as a member of the first Mile County Political Consultative Conference; the county government awarded her the title of folk doctor and presented her with a certificate. Her husband, Zhang Lianhui, also attended the commendation meeting of the Red River Prefecture Health Bureau with honor.

The joint event by the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and this newspaper, "Promoting Ethnic Unity and Progress," has now concluded. Thank you to all authors, readers, and relevant departments for your enthusiastic support. The list of winners will be announced in this newspaper shortly.

　　越过日本海峡的爱
　　张清渝
    在云南省南部山区弥勒县钟山村的一个农家小院里，住着一位不属于当地任何民族的老大妈，她的名字叫五十岚美惠子。
    五十岚美惠子原是日本人。1943年春天，16岁的美惠子随父母从日本新澙县三岛郡片贝町老家来到中国东北的佳木斯。在一次空袭中，美惠子在混乱中与父母失散了。后来，一位好心肠的中国医生收留了她，将她介绍到国民党三十六兵站医院当了一名护士。
    1946年，佳木斯解放了，人民政府收容了她，还发给她一张日侨居留证。不久，美惠子与一位名叫张联昌的同事结了婚。1947年夏天，五十岚美惠子随同丈夫回云南老家弥勒，途中不幸发生车祸，丈夫丧生，自己也受了重伤。张联昌的弟弟张联辉接到电报后，赶到昆明处理了后事。五十岚美惠子随小叔回到丈夫家。婆婆是位善良的农村妇女，很体贴这个不幸的日本媳妇。
    美惠子就这样在中国的一个山村里住下来了。生活是艰苦的，她和大家一样脚穿草鞋登山打柴，一天下来，皮破脚肿。小叔见她这样吃苦，很过意不去，腰里常别一双软布鞋，出了家门就塞给她。美惠子对小叔的情意非常感激，慢慢地两人便产生了爱情，1952年他俩结了婚。美惠子看到山民治病难，就努力学医，两口子当了民间医生，给山里的彝族、苗族、傣族、壮族和汉族群众治病。
    一个日本女人，经历了一段奇特的生活道路，在中国西南这个偏僻的山村有了归宿。她有钟情的丈夫，有心爱的女儿，有和村里各民族群众融洽的感情。她感到生活得很安宁、幸福。然而，不久，在华的日籍人大量遣返，县及专署的公安局也多次来动员她回日本去。美惠子虽然始终回答说：“不去日本，要留中国，”但是她的心情却再也无法平静了。她和丈夫商量，写了一份申请报告，直接寄给公安部，呈报国务院，恳请加入了中国籍。当她看到那张有周总理的亲笔署名的中国国籍证书时，悬着的一颗心才落了地。从此，她改叫中国名字伍惠珍。
    1982年5月，50多岁的五十岚美惠子，带着她的两个女儿和一个小外孙到日本探亲。她从上海搭乘中日航空公司的班机，越过茫茫大海，飞抵东京。
    回到阔别四十多年的故土，美惠子对眼前的一切都感到新鲜。她的名字已经刻在新澙神社前面的阵亡兵士的石碑上。现在突然归来，父母、亲人那狂喜之情真是难以描述。
    美惠子在亲人们热情照应下，生活得十分舒适。按理，美惠子该心满意足了。细心的妈妈看出她的心思，劝女儿不要回中国了。美惠子说：“中国那个小山村有我的家、我的丈夫、我的儿孙，还有保护过我的乡亲，有我喝水的井，我一定要回去！”
    1983年9月6日，美惠子终于领着女儿和外孙，同父母弟妹依依话别，离开东京，又回到了她魂牵梦绕的钟山村。外交部批准她的探亲期限是五年，美惠子只住了一年。
    1984年7月，伍惠珍被选为弥勒县首届政协委员；县人民政府授予她民间医生称号，颁发了证书。老伴张联辉也光荣地出席了红河州卫生局的表彰大会。
    国家民委与本报联合举办的《民族团结进步》征文，到今天结束。感谢广大作者、读者和有关部门的热情支持。不久本报将公布获奖者名单。
