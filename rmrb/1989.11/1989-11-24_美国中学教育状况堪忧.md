Currently, the situation in American schools is causing great concern among educators. Statistics show that every year, 1 million high school students drop out, and in some inland cities, the dropout rate reaches 50%. Among the 2.4 million high school graduates, 1/4 still lack basic reading and writing skills, and are deficient in fundamental cultural literacy. More than half of the 17-year-old students nationwide cannot summarize the main points of a newspaper article, write a job application letter, calculate the area of a rectangle, or even read a train schedule. Recently, the National Education Supervisory Committee published an article titled "A Nation in Danger," expressing concern over the massive educational expenditures and the declining quality of education. To improve the effectiveness of educational investments and enhance teaching quality, the committee advocates for the establishment of strict learning standards and the formulation of a high school curriculum that adheres to traditional norms to guide teaching in various subjects.

Albert Shanker, president of the National Education Association, calls for a thorough reform of the educational system. He said, "If a company's products are 90% defective, it's time to examine the entire production process. Our education system has problems throughout."

How to change this situation? Opinions vary, and there is no consensus.

However, regardless of the methods used, to improve teaching quality, more and better teachers are needed. But reports indicate that at least half of the current teachers in the U.S. are unqualified, and 1 million teachers need to be replaced. Among the 1.6 million college graduates each year, only 8% are interested in education. Even so, most of them may change their minds before employment. Additionally, in recent years, the U.S. has faced a shortage of highly educated workers, and with the competition from other industries offering better pay, more than 50% of new teachers will leave within 7 years to seek better opportunities.

Some local education departments have already adopted the method of raising salaries to retain and expand the teaching workforce. However, so far, this approach has had little effect and has not been able to attract more people to the field of education.

　　美国中学教育状况堪忧
　　韩祝平
    目前，美国学校里的状况令教育界人士十分担忧。据统计，每年有100万中学生中途辍学，一些内陆城市学校的辍学率高达50％。在240万中学毕业生中，1／4的人仍不具备读写能力，缺乏基本的文化素质。全国一半以上的17岁学生归纳不出一篇报刊文章的大意，写不了求职信，算不出长方形的面积，甚至有的读不懂火车时刻表。最近，美国国家教育监察委员会发表一篇题为《一个危险的民族》的文章，对国家教育开支巨大，教学质量却在逐年下降表示忧虑。为改进教育投资的效果，提高教学质量，该机构倡议确定严格的学习标准，制订符合传统规范的中学教学大纲，指导各科教学。
    全美教师联盟主席阿尔伯特·山可则呼吁彻底改革教学制度。他说：“如果一家公司生产的产品有90％是次品，就该检查一下整个生产过程了。我们的教育是整个体制出了毛病。”
    如何改变这种状况呢？人们意见纷纭，莫衷一是。
    不过，无论采用什么方法，要提高教学质量，首先要有更多更好的教师。但据报道，美国在职教师中至少有一半不称职，需要更换100万名教师。而每年160万大学毕业生中，却仅有8％的学生对教育感兴趣，即使如此，其中多数人还会在就业前随时改变主意。另外，近些年美国文化水平高的劳动力匮乏，在其他行业报酬优厚的竞争下，50％以上的新教师在7年内会纷纷“跳槽”，另谋高就。
    有些地方的教育部门已采取提高工资的方法，期望以此保持和壮大教师队伍。但是，到目前为止，这种做法收效甚微，仍无力吸引更多的人从事教育工作。
