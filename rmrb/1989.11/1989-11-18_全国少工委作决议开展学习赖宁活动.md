The National Young Pioneers' Committee has issued a resolution calling on the 130 million young people across the country to extensively carry out the study of Lai Ning activities.

This resolution was passed at the recently concluded Seventh Plenary Session of the National Young Pioneers' Committee held in Chongqing.

Lai Ning, before his death, was a junior high school student at Shimen County Middle School in Sichuan Province. He was an all-around excellent student. In March 1988, to extinguish a mountain fire, he fought in the flames for four to five hours and sacrificed his precious life. He was posthumously awarded the title of "Heroic Youth" by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the State Education Commission.

The resolution calls on young people nationwide to learn from Lai Ning's ambition, to start from a young age, to combine their ideals with the aspiration to serve the country, and to link great aspirations with small deeds; to learn from Lai Ning's love for science, courage to practice, diligence in study, and thirst for knowledge; to learn from Lai Ning's active progress, disdain for difficulties, fearlessness of setbacks, and unyielding spirit, to train and shape themselves from multiple angles; to learn from Lai Ning's love for the motherland, fearlessness in the face of danger, and strong sense of responsibility towards the country and the people.

The resolution hopes that local Young Pioneers' leadership organizations will take this as a key focus for the winter and next year's Young Pioneers' work, and make detailed arrangements based on local realities. It requires each Young Pioneer to read a book about Lai Ning's deeds, set a goal to contribute to the motherland, overcome one difficulty on the path to progress, and do one good deed for the people or the collective.

Li Yuanchao, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, emphasized at the meeting that we should learn from Lai Ning in the same way we learned from Lei Feng.

    全国少工委作决议开展学习赖宁活动
    据新华社重庆11月16日电 （记者刘亢）中国少年先锋队全国工作委员会今天作出决议，号召全国一亿三千万少年儿童广泛开展学赖宁活动。
    此项决议是在此间刚结束的全国少工委第七次全委扩大会议上通过的。
    赖宁生前是四川省石棉县中学初中学生。他品学兼优，全面发展。1988年3月，为了扑灭山火，在烈火中奋战四五个小时，献出了宝贵生命，被团中央、国家教委授予“英雄少年”称号。
    决议号召全国少年儿童学习赖宁胸怀大志，从小做起，把自己的理想与报效国家的志向结合起来，把立大志与做小事联系起来；学习赖宁热爱科学，勇于实践，勤奋学习，渴求知识；学习赖宁积极进取，藐视困难，不怕挫折，永不停滞，从多侧面锻炼和塑造自己；学习赖宁热爱祖国，临危不惧，对国家和人民具有强烈责任感。
    决议希望各地少先队领导机构，以此作为今冬和明年少先队工作重点，依据本地实际情况周密部署；要求每个少先队员阅读一本介绍赖宁事迹的书，树立一个为祖国作贡献的目标，克服一个前进道路上的困难，做一件对人民或集体有利的好事。
    团中央书记处书记李源潮在这次会议上强调要像当年学雷锋那样学赖宁。
