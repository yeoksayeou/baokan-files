A reporter from Xinhua News Agency in Guangzhou reported on November 12th: According to information from the recent national family planning contraceptive supplies conference held in Guangzhou, China has established a team of 2 million people responsible for the supply, management, and distribution of contraceptives. A six-tier supply and distribution network, from the central government down to the village level, has been basically formed. Counties and above have established contraceptive management institutions and have appointed full-time management personnel who have undergone training.

To support the implementation of the family planning policy, China has produced a large number of contraceptives. From January to September this year alone, 46.61 million doses of short-acting drugs, 269.2 million doses of external-use drugs, and 760 million condoms were produced.

To maximize convenience for the public, since 1986, major and medium-sized cities have begun trials of priced retail sales of contraceptives, implementing a "dual-track" system that combines free distribution of contraceptives according to the plan with market retail sales. Currently, the number of retail outlets is expanding and increasing, and is being extended from major and medium-sized cities to townships. According to statistics from the end of last year, 45% of married women of childbearing age in China are using various contraceptives.

    我国健全避孕药具管理机构
    据新华社广州11月12日电 （记者田炳信、实习生杨从蓉）记者从日前在广州召开的全国计划生育药具工作会议上获悉：我国已形成一支200万人的避孕药具供应、管理、发放队伍。中央、省、地、县、乡、村六级供应发放网络已基本形成，县以上都建立了避孕药具管理机构，配备了经过培训的专职药具管理人员。
    为配合计划生育这一国策的实行，我国生产了大量避孕药具，仅今年1至9月，就生产了短效药4661万片（支），外用药26920万片（粒、支、张），避孕套7.6亿只。
    为了最大限度地方便群众，从1986年开始，在各大中城市试行避孕药具计价零售，实行了避孕药具按计划免费发放与市场零售相结合的“双轨制”。目前，市场零售的网点正在扩大和增加，并由大中城市向乡镇扩展。据去年底统计，我国已有占总数45％的已婚育龄妇女使用各种避孕药具。
