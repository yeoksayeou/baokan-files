Our country's first 5-megawatt low-temperature nuclear heating experimental reactor successfully started up and began operation today at the Nuclear Energy Technology Research Institute of Tsinghua University. This marks a breakthrough in our country's peaceful use of nuclear energy.

The low-temperature nuclear heating reactor is used for centralized urban heating and has the characteristic of good safety performance. It can achieve coal substitution with nuclear power, solving the serious air pollution problem caused by coal heating in northern cities.

The low-temperature nuclear heating reactor is a key scientific and technological project of the national "Seventh Five-Year Plan." After more than three years of design and construction, the reactor was completed in May of this year. After undergoing safety reviews, emergency drills, and operator assessments organized by the National Nuclear Safety Administration, it received the first fuel loading approval from the Nuclear Safety Administration and completed the nuclear fuel loading on October 9.

This reactor adopts a one-piece natural circulation shell-type pressurized water reactor design, with a double safety barrier consisting of a pressure vessel and a containment shell, and an intermediate isolation loop, possessing excellent safety characteristics. The reactor uses a unique hydraulic drive control rod system developed in China, with all major equipment domestically produced, reaching an internationally advanced level. This reactor is also the world's first shell-type nuclear heating reactor to begin operation.

Vice Premier and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian attended today's ceremony for the reactor to reach criticality and begin operation.

    我低温核供热技术获突破  首座壳式反应堆投入运行
    本报北京11月11日讯　记者叶紫报道：我国第一座5兆瓦低温核供热试验反应堆，今天在清华大学核能技术研究所启动运行成功。这是我国在和平利用核能方面取得的一项突破性进展。
    低温核供热堆用于城市集中供热，具有安全性能好的特点，可以实现以核代煤，解决北方城市燃煤取暖所造成的严重空气污染问题。
    低温核供热堆是国家“七五”计划重点科技攻关项目。这个反应堆经过3年多的设计建设，于今年5月建成。经过国家核安全局组织有关专家进行安全评审、应急演习审查和操作人员考核，获得核安全局首次装料批准书，于10月9日完成核燃料装放。
    这个反应堆采用一体化自然循环壳式轻水堆的方案，设置有压力壳和安全壳双重安全屏障，设有中间隔离回路，具有良好的安全特性。反应堆采用了我国独创的水力驱动控制棒系统，主要设备均为国产化，技术上达到国际先进水平。这座反应堆也是世界上第一座投入运行的壳式核供热堆。
    国务委员、国家科委主任宋健参加了今天核反应堆达到临界启动运行的仪式。
