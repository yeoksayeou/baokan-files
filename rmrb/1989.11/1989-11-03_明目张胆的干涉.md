U.S. President Bush signed an official document on October 21, deciding to allocate $9 million to support the opposition in Nicaragua's upcoming February elections. White House Press Secretary Fitzwater announced this news, claiming that the U.S. is taking this action to "promote" democracy in Nicaragua.

The people of Nicaragua, under the leadership of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), overthrew the Somoza pro-American dictatorship in 1979, achieving revolutionary victory. After the FSLN government took power, it pursued national self-determination and refused to be dependent on the United States, which aroused American hostility. Over the past decade, the U.S. government, under the pretext of opposing "communist expansion," has imposed military threats, economic sanctions, and diplomatic isolation on Nicaragua. It has also provided financial and military support to the Nicaraguan anti-government forces, attempting to force change through pressure, fully exposing the hegemonic face of American bullying and aggression.

The strong-arm policies pursued by the United States have not only brought serious difficulties to the people of Nicaragua but have also delayed the resolution of turmoil in Central America. Recently, amidst an international climate shifting from tension to relaxation and from confrontation to dialogue, the heads of state of Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Costa Rica held a meeting. Excluding external interference, they finally reached an agreement to disband the Nicaraguan anti-government forces stationed in Honduras.

At the same time, Nicaragua announced that it will hold elections in February next year. These developments have brought a glimmer of hope for peace in Central America.

Nicaragua's announcement of elections next February demonstrates its sincerity in resolving conflicts in Central America and its confidence in implementing democracy at home. However, the United States is unwilling to accept defeat. It is obstructing and sabotaging the efforts to disband the Nicaraguan anti-government forces while placing its hopes on Nicaragua's upcoming elections, resorting to all means to influence the domestic political situation.

Currently, Nicaragua is in the midst of election campaigns. Recent opinion polls show that the FSLN is in the lead. In this situation, the United States is willing to violate international norms and openly announce financial support for the National Opposition Union in Nicaragua, aiming to achieve through money what it could not through military force. Latin American public opinion considers this another brazen interference by the United States in Nicaragua's internal affairs.

    明目张胆的干涉
    沈家松
    美国总统布什10月21日正式签署一项文件，决定出钱900万美元，资助参加明年2月大选的尼加拉瓜反对派。白宫新闻秘书菲茨沃特在宣布这一消息时声称，美国采取这一措施的目的是“促进”在尼加拉瓜实行“民主”。
    尼加拉瓜人民在桑地诺民族解放阵线（桑解阵）领导下，于1979年推翻索摩查亲美独裁政权，取得革命的胜利。桑解阵政府执政后，实行民族自决，拒绝依附美国，引起了美国的仇视。近10年来，美国政府借口反对“共产主义扩张”，大力对尼加拉瓜实行军事威胁、经济制裁和外交孤立，并出钱出枪支持尼加拉瓜反政府武装，力图以压促变，充分暴露了美国以大欺小、以强凌弱的霸权主义面目。
    美国实行的这种强权政策，不仅给尼加拉瓜人民带来了严重的困难，而且使中美洲地区的动乱迟迟不能解决。最近，在整个国际形势由紧张走向缓和、由对抗走向对话的大气候下，尼加拉瓜、洪都拉斯、危地马拉、萨尔瓦多和哥斯达黎加5个中美洲国家的首脑举行会议，排除外来干扰，终于达成协议，决定遣散盘踞在洪都拉斯境内的尼加拉瓜反政府武装。
    与此同时，尼加拉瓜宣布明年2月举行大选。这些，都为中美洲地区实现和平带来了曙光。
    尼加拉瓜政府宣布明年举行大选，表明它对解决中美洲地区冲突的诚意，也表明它在国内实行民主的信心。然而，美国却不甘失败，它一面阻挠和破坏遣散尼反政府武装的活动，一面把希望寄托于尼加拉瓜明年大选，不惜采取一切手段，影响尼加拉瓜国内政局。
    目前，尼加拉瓜国内正在开展竞选活动。最近民意测验显示，桑解阵占优势。在此情况下，美国不惜违反国际准则，公然宣布出钱支持尼全国反对派联盟，以达到它用武力未能达到的目的。拉美舆论认为，这是美国对尼加拉瓜内政又一次明目张胆的干涉。
