A delegation led by Soviet Communist Party Politburo member and Central Committee Secretary Alexander Yakovlev visited Japan from November 12 to 18. Yakovlev is the highest-ranking Soviet leader to visit Japan in recent years. This visit comes at a time when U.S.-Soviet relations are easing and Sino-Soviet relations are normalizing, making Soviet-Japanese relations an urgent issue in Soviet diplomacy. Both sides clearly attach great importance to this visit.

During the visit, the main topic of Yakovlev's talks with Japanese leaders was improving Soviet-Japanese relations. On this issue, both sides have common ground. They both believe that improving Soviet-Japanese relations is of great significance and have expressed a willingness to work towards establishing friendly neighborly relations. However, there are also obvious differences. Yakovlev advocates not being constrained by the "difficult issues" between the two countries and pushing forward in various areas to deepen relations and achieve friendly neighborly ties. He disagrees with Japan's "politics and economics are inseparable" principle, advocating that "economic relations between the Soviet Union and Japan should be promoted separately." In light of Gorbachev's proposal in May to "set aside" the territorial issue and develop Soviet-Japanese relations, it is clear that the Soviet Union is trying to bypass the Northern Territories issue and establish close economic relations with Japan. The Japanese side, however, emphasizes that territory is the most basic element of a country and that the Northern Territories must first be returned before a Soviet-Japanese peace treaty can be signed, thereby fundamentally improving the economic and other relations between the two countries. This shows that Japan is wary of the Soviet Union's intention to push forward only economic relations without resolving the territorial issue. It is clear that the biggest obstacle to improving Soviet-Japanese relations remains the Northern Territories issue.

During this visit, when discussing the Northern Territories issue, Yakovlev said, "If both the Soviet Union and Japan stick to their own positions, then progress on this issue will be difficult. Perhaps we can explore a third option." When the Japanese Foreign Minister compared Soviet-Japanese relations to "food that has been frozen for forty-four years," Yakovlev picked up the thread: "If the timing is too early, taking food out of the freezer will cause it to rot." He also said, "Perhaps a miraculous conclusion can be reached on the border issue." These remarks sparked great interest in the Japanese media. Some speculated that the Soviet Union might compromise. The "third option" could be "political and economic cooperation" or "returning two islands" and "joint management by the Soviet Union and Japan." Some even speculated that this "timing" might refer to Gorbachev's visit to Japan next year. Therefore, at the beginning of the visit, there was a wave of optimism. However, the Japanese media later believed that the Soviet side was engaged in "smile diplomacy" to "divide Japanese public opinion." Prime Minister Kaifu reiterated after the talks that improving Soviet-Japanese relations must first resolve the Northern Territories issue.

In fact, the results of Yakovlev's visit were not surprising. In recent years, Soviet-Japanese relations have indeed shown some positive trends. After the Soviet Foreign Minister's visit to Japan last December, the two foreign ministers have met three times. The two countries have established a permanent working group for the Soviet-Japanese peace treaty. At the beginning of this month, a large Soviet economic delegation visited Japan. Next January, a delegation from the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan will visit the Soviet Union. This shows that both sides have a desire to improve relations. However, all diplomatic exchanges between the two countries to date have been a "detour." There has been no progress on the biggest obstacle in Soviet-Japanese relations, the Northern Territories issue. It seems that as long as this issue is not resolved, Soviet-Japanese relations are unlikely to see substantial improvement.

    从雅科夫列夫访问看日苏关系
    张国成
    由苏共中央政治局委员、中央书记雅科夫列夫率领的苏联最高苏维埃代表团十二日至十八日对日本进行了一次引人注目的访问。雅科夫列夫是近年来访日的最高级别的苏联领导人，这次访问正值美苏关系趋缓、中苏关系正常化之后，苏日关系已上升为苏联外交的迫切课题。日苏双方显然都十分重视这次访问。
    访问期间，雅科夫列夫同日本领导人会谈的主要议题是改善苏日关系。在这个问题上，双方有共同点。他们都认为改善日苏关系具有重要意义，并表示要为建立睦邻友好关系而努力。但同时也存在着明显分歧。雅科夫列夫主张不要被两国间现存的“困难问题”束缚住手脚，要从多方面深化两国关系，实现睦邻友好。他不同意日本“政经不可分”的原则，主张“应单独推进苏日经济关系”。联系到今年五月戈尔巴乔夫提出“搁置”领土问题，发展苏日关系，使人明显地感到苏联力图绕开北方领土问题同日本建立密切的经济关系。日本官方则强调，领土是构成国家的最基本要素，必须首先归还北方领土，才可能签署日苏和约，进而从根本上改善包括经济在内的日苏关系。这表现出日本对苏联只想推进经济关系而不解决领土问题的意图保持警惕。可见改善日苏关系的最大障碍仍是北方领土问题。
    在这次访问中，雅科夫列夫在谈到北方领土问题时说，“如果苏日都固执己见，那么在这个问题上就寸步难行。是否可探讨第三种方案”。当日本外相把日苏关系比作“冷冻了四十四年的食品”时，雅科夫列夫接过话头：“如果时机过早，从冷冻库拿出的食品就会腐烂。”他还说，“关于边界问题也许会得出奇迹般的结论”。这些言论引起了日本舆论界的极大兴趣。有人推测苏联有可能妥协。“第三种方案”可能是“政经同步”或“归还两岛”及“日苏共管”等。有人还据此猜测，这“时机”可能是指戈尔巴乔夫后年访日。因此，访问开始时出现了一股乐观情绪。但随后日本舆论界又认为，苏方是在搞表现灵活姿态的“微笑外交”，目的在于“分化日本舆论”。海部首相在会谈后重申，改善日苏关系必须首先解决北方领土问题。
    其实，雅科夫列夫的访问结果并不出人意料。近些年来，日苏关系确实出现一些积极势头。去年十二月苏联外长访日后，两国外长已三次会晤。两国成立了日苏和约常设工作小组。本月初一个大型苏联经济考察团访问了日本。明年一月日本自民党代表团将访苏。这表现出双方都有改善关系的愿望。但迄今日苏间所有外交往来，实际上打的是“迂回战”，在两国关系的最大障碍北方领土问题上并无进展。看来，只要这个问题不解决，日苏关系恐怕很难得到实质性改善。
