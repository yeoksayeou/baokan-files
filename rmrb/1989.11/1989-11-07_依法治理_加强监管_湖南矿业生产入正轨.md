Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 6th - Reporter Wu Xinghua reports: During the rectification and reorganization, Hunan Province has strengthened the management of mineral resource development and utilization. The order of mining production has begun to return to normal.

Hunan Province is rich in mineral resources and is known as the "home of non-ferrous metals." The history of mining development in the province is long. In the past decade, mining development has progressed rapidly. However, due to various reasons, for a period of time, the management of mineral resources and mining development was neglected, leading to serious problems such as illegal mining and reckless exploitation.

After the National People's Congress passed the "Mining Resources Law" in 1986, Hunan Province, in accordance with its own situation, formulated a series of regulations in conjunction with the law. In 1987, the Provincial People's Congress promulgated the "Measures for the Management of Mining by Township and Village Collective Enterprises and Individual Mining in Hunan Province." Various relevant departments in the province made clear regulations on procedures such as mining permits, explosive materials, storage, electricity use, and loans, as well as penalties and punishments for violations of the Mining Resources Law. This has gradually led the entire province onto the track of legal management of the mining industry.

    依法治理　加强监管
    湖南矿业生产入正轨
    本报长沙11月6日电　记者吴兴华报道：湖南省在治理整顿中，加强对矿产资源开发利用的管理，矿业生产秩序开始走上正轨。
    湖南矿产资源丰富，有“有色金属之乡”之称，矿业开发历史悠久。近10年来，矿业开发发展很快，但由于多方面的原因，一段时间内忽视矿产资源和矿业开发的管理，非法办矿、乱采滥挖等问题比较严重。
    1986年，全国人大通过的《矿产资源法》颁布后，湖南省结合本省的情况，制定了与之配套的一系列法规。1987年，省人大颁布了《湖南省乡镇集体企业采矿和个体采矿管理办法》；省各有关部门对采矿许可证、爆破器材、储存、用电、贷款等手续，对违反矿产资源法的行为进行制裁、惩处等办法，作出了明确规定，使全省逐步走上依法治理矿业的轨道。
