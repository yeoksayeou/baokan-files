Jiang Zemin Inspects Yunnan Border Ethnic Regions
Emphasizes Importance of Ethnic Unity and Development of Economy, Education, and Culture in Ethnic Regions
Requires All Levels of Officials from Central to Grassroots to Ensure Implementation of Various Tasks

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, November 22 (Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Qinghai, Yunnan Daily reporter Wang Ziming) General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Central Military Commission Jiang Zemin recently emphasized during his inspection of the border ethnic regions in Yunnan that ethnic harmony, ethnic unity, and the development of the economy, education, and culture in ethnic regions, as well as improving the lives of the people, are issues that all officials working in ethnic regions must highly value.

Comrade Jiang Zemin visited Yunnan Province's Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Simao Region, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, and Kunming City from November 16 to 22. Yunnan Provincial Party Secretary Pu Chaogui, Deputy Commander of the Chengdu Military Region Liao Xilong, and Political Commissar of the Yunnan Military Region Zhao Kun accompanied the inspection. Comrade Jiang Zemin was warmly welcomed by officials, masses, and soldiers of all ethnic groups wherever he went.

In conversations with officials at various levels in Yunnan, Comrade Jiang Zemin repeatedly reminded everyone to value ethnic unity and the development of the economy, education, and culture in border ethnic regions. He said that strengthening ethnic unity on the basis of ethnic equality is a major principle of Marxism. This issue has been well addressed in our country, and Yunnan Province has also done well in this regard.

Comrade Jiang Zemin praised the practice of the Wenshan Prefecture Party Committee in dispatching a large number of officials to work in rural areas and adhering to the mass line. He said that if officials do not go down to the grassroots, talking about the mass line is empty. From the central level down to the provincial, regional, and county levels, officials must go deep into the masses to conduct investigations and research, and go to the grassroots to ensure the implementation of various tasks. In this way, the situation will continue to improve.

Comrade Jiang Zemin showed great concern for the ethnic minorities in the border regions. During the inspection, he visited Miao villages, Zhuang towns, Dai bamboo houses, and Jinuo Mountain villages, and had heart-to-heart talks with ethnic minority grassroots officials and masses. Comrade Jiang Zemin told the officials and masses that ethnic officials should not only learn social sciences but also some natural sciences. The development of tropical economic crops and local industries in ethnic regions must have ethnic officials with high cultural standards. After your lives gradually improve, you should pay attention to cultivating the next generation and let the children study more. He also said that the Dai ethnic group's practice of voluntarily implementing family planning and not cutting down trees indiscriminately is very good, and the Han and other ethnic groups should learn from it.

On November 19, Comrade Jiang Zemin climbed Jinuo Mountain and visited the residence of the Jinuo ethnic group, one of the ethnic groups with the smallest population in China. When he arrived at the oldest village of the Jinuo ethnic group, Manbo Village, the Jinuo ethnic group performed their most solemn big drum dance to welcome the General Secretary and expressed their gratitude for the care of the Party Central Committee. Comrade Jiang Zemin told the officials and masses that ethnic groups, regardless of their size, number of people, or length of history, should be treated equally and should unite and learn from each other to achieve common prosperity. He emphasized that it is very beneficial to improve the cultural quality of ethnic groups, and this should be continued.

In Xishuangbanna, General Secretary Jiang Zemin also enthusiastically inspected the Yunnan Tropical Crops Research Institute, the Yunnan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicinal Plant Resources, and the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanic Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and listened to reports from the heads of various units. At the Institute of Medicinal Plants, Jiang Zemin learned about the research and development of important southern medicines such as sand ginger and discussed with the responsible person from the State Planning Commission who accompanied the inspection on solving the production and sales problems of sand ginger and other southern medicines. At the Botanical Garden, Jiang Zemin focused on understanding the development and research of tropical plant resources and inquired about the work and living conditions of scientific researchers from other provinces working at the Botanical Garden. He pointed out that the achievements in scientific research in the border ethnic minority regions are the result of the hard work and sweat of scientific researchers and workers. Everyone has worked hard in the border regions for so many years, dedicating their youth to the cause of national scientific research, which is admirable. Comrade Jiang Zemin, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, expressed his greetings to all scientific researchers and workers and wished them greater achievements.

After listening to the report from the responsible comrades of the Xishuangbanna Prefecture Party Committee, Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized that efforts should be made to improve agricultural production, especially grain production. He said that it is not enough to rely solely on the enthusiasm of the farmers; the central, provincial, regional, and county governments at all levels must attach importance to agriculture, conduct in-depth research, increase investment, develop water conservancy, strengthen and improve the agricultural service system, and increase the supply of fertilizers and pesticides. He pointed out that Yunnan Province has great potential for developing agriculture and grain production, and measures should be taken to gradually achieve self-sufficiency in grain.

Comrade Jiang Zemin also specially went to inspect a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, visited the officers and soldiers of the heroic Seventh Company, and went deep into the soldiers' dormitories to inquire about their well-being. He told the officers and soldiers that Yunnan is located at the southwestern frontier of the motherland, and the tasks of the PLA officers and soldiers are arduous and glorious. He, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, extended his sincere greetings to the broad officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in Yunnan and hoped that they would continue to carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions and make new contributions to defending the motherland.

During his stay in Yunnan, Comrade Jiang Zemin listened to the report of the Provincial Party Committee and delivered an important speech at the Party cadre meeting convened by the Provincial Party Committee. He also successively inspected the Kunming Machine Tool Factory, Yunnan Machine Tool Factory, and Kunming Cigarette Factory, encouraging these large and medium-sized enterprises to further play a leading role.

Comrades accompanying Comrade Jiang Zemin on the inspection included: Wang Weiqing, Director of the Central Policy Research Office, Liu Zhongyi, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission, Zhao Yanni, Deputy Director of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Chen Yaobang, Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Xu Huizhi, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army, and Zeng Qinghong, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Central Committee.

On November 22, Comrade Jiang Zemin met with military officers above the rank of major at the location of the Chengdu Military Region's troops in Kunming and concluded his inspection work in Yunnan, returning to Beijing.

    新华社昆明11月22日电　（新华社记者王青海、云南日报记者汪子明）中共中央总书记、中央军委主席江泽民最近在云南边疆民族地区视察时强调指出：民族和睦，民族团结，发展民族经济、教育、文化，改善群众生活，这是所有在民族地区工作的干部必须高度重视的问题。
    江泽民同志于11月16日到22日，视察了云南省文山壮族苗族自治州、思茅地区、西双版纳傣族自治州和昆明市。云南省委书记普朝柱、成都军区副司令员廖锡龙、云南省军区政委赵坤陪同视察。江泽民同志所到之处，受到各族干部、群众、人民解放军指战员的热烈欢迎。
    在同云南各级干部交谈中，江泽民同志一再告诫大家，要重视民族团结，重视发展边疆民族地区的经济和教育、文化。他说，在民族平等的基础上加强民族团结，是马克思主义的一个重大原则问题。这个问题，我们国家解决得比较好，云南省解决得也是好的。
    江泽民同志肯定了文山州委抽调大批干部到农村工作、坚持走群众路线的做法。他说，干部不下去，嘴上讲群众路线，那是空的。从中央开始，省、地、县的干部都要深入到群众中去调查研究，到基层抓各项工作的落实。这样，形势就会越来越好。
    江泽民同志非常关心边疆少数民族同胞。在视察期间，他风尘仆仆地访问了苗寨、壮乡、傣家竹楼、基诺山村，同少数民族基层干部、群众促膝谈心。江泽民同志对干部、群众说，民族干部不仅要学习社会科学知识，还要学点自然科学。发展热带经济作物和民族地方工业，一定要有文化水平高的民族干部。你们生活逐步富裕后，要注意培养下一代，让孩子们多念点书。他还说，傣族自觉实行计划生育，不乱砍树，这个习惯很好，汉族和其他兄弟民族应该学习。
    19日，江泽民同志登上基诺山，访问了我国人口最少的民族之一基诺族居住地。他来到基诺族最古老的寨子曼波寨时，基诺族群众跳起了本民族最隆重的大鼓舞，欢迎总书记临门，感谢党中央的关怀。江泽民同志对干群们说，民族不分大小，不论人数多少和历史长短，要一律平等，要相互团结，相互学习，才能走向共同繁荣。他强调，抓民族文化素质的提高很有好处，要好好抓下去。
    在西双版纳，江泽民总书记还兴致勃勃地视察了云南省热带作物研究所、中国科学院药用植物资源开发研究所云南分所、中国科学院西双版纳热带植物园，听取了各单位负责人的汇报。在药物所，江泽民同志了解了砂仁等重要南药的研究与发展情况，并与随同前往考察的国家计委的负责人一起，探讨了解决砂仁等南药产销中的问题。在植物园，江泽民同志着重了解了热带植物资源的开发研究情况，询问了在植物园工作的外省科研人员的工作、生活情况。他指出，边疆少数民族地区科研工作取得的成绩，凝结着科研人员、工人的心血和汗水。大家在边疆辛勤劳动了这么多年，为祖国的科研事业献出了青春，令人敬佩。江泽民同志代表党中央、国务院向全体科研人员和工人表示慰问，并祝大家取得更大的成就。
    江泽民同志在听取西双版纳州委负责同志汇报后强调，要下功夫把农业特别是粮食生产搞上去。他说，光有农民的积极性是不够的，中央、省、地、县各级都要重视农业，认真研究农业，要增加投入，兴修水利，加强和完善农业服务体系，还要增加化肥、农药的供应。他指出，云南全省发展农业和粮食生产的潜力都是很大的，要采取措施，逐步做到粮食自给。
    江泽民同志还专程赶赴人民解放军某部驻地视察，看望了某部英雄七连的官兵，并深入到战士宿舍，问寒问暖。他对指战员们说，云南地处祖国的西南前哨，解放军官兵的任务是艰巨的，也是光荣的。他代表党中央、国务院、中央军委，向驻云南部队广大指战员表示衷心的慰问，并希望指战员们继续发扬光荣的革命传统，为保卫祖国再立新功。
    在云南期间，江泽民同志听取了省委常委的汇报，在省委召开的党员干部大会上发表了重要讲话。他还先后视察了昆明机床厂、云南机床厂、昆明卷烟厂，鼓励这些大中型企业要进一步发挥骨干作用。
    随同江泽民同志视察的有：中央政策研究室主任王维澄、国家计委副主任刘中一、国家民委副主任赵延年、农业部副部长陈耀邦、人民解放军副总参谋长徐惠滋、中共中央办公厅副主任曾庆红。
