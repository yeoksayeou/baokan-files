Northeast Normal University held an award ceremony on November 22, conferring the title of "Outstanding Student for Self-Sacrifice" on 19 students, including Kamili, to commend them for writing a song of selfless dedication with their actual actions.

At 4:05 PM on November 11, students from the second division of the affiliated middle school of Northeast Normal University had just finished their classes. Two seventh-grade students, Li Ning and Lin Changsheng, were walking and kicking a soccer ball in the schoolyard. The ball rolled into the center of the artificial lake. Forgetting the school's repeated announcements not to step on the ice into the lake, they both stepped onto the thin ice to retrieve the ball. When they reached about 20 meters from the shore, Li Ning, who was in front, suddenly broke through the ice layer and fell into an ice hole more than two meters deep.

At that moment, Kamili Muyiding (Uyghur, a graduate student from Xinjiang University studying in Japan), Ke'ilan Alimuhan (Kazakh, a graduate student from Xinjiang University studying in Japan), and Jiang Jianzhuang (a graduate student from Beijing University's Department of Chemistry, studying for a Ph.D. at the preparatory school for Japan) had just finished listening to a report on Jiang Zemin's National Day speech and were returning to their dormitory. Seeing someone fall into the ice hole, they rushed over to rescue them.

Kamili jumped into the lake from about 20 meters away from the fallen boy on the west shore, while Jiang Jianzhuang quickly observed the terrain and rode his bike around to the island in the center of the lake, took off his coat, and jumped into the water, breaking the ice as he swam forward.

It was mid-November in Changchun, with a temperature of minus 10 degrees Celsius. The ice water was bone-chilling, turning people's bodies purple. Kamili and Jiang Jianzhuang, who had entered the water first, used their fists to break the ice and their arms to ram it, advancing from different positions towards the same target. Their bodies were numb from the cold, and their hands and feet were cut by ice shards. Soon, Kamili's leg cramped, and he began to sink. Ke'ilan, who had also entered the water, had to pull him out of the lake first. After a fierce struggle, Jiang Jianzhuang was also exhausted. He returned to the shore to catch his breath and then continued to break the ice. At this time, Wang Liduo (a graduate of Shandong University, studying for a Ph.D. at the preparatory school for Japan) also arrived, and the two of them worked together to break the ice.

The call for help reached the soccer field about 50 meters away from the artificial lake. Northeast Normal University's graduate student Fan Deming from the Department of Mathematics, Zhang Yong, Li You, and 10 other students from the 89th class of the Department of Geography dropped their soccer balls, ran while taking off their outer clothes, and jumped into the water one after another. They joined Jiang Jianzhuang and Wang Liduo in breaking the ice in front of them and then rescued the fallen boy.

On that afternoon, Zhao Boqing, a student from the 87th class of the Department of Educational Technology at Northeast Normal University, was making dumplings with a few classmates in the third student cafeteria. Suddenly, his classmate Ji Hongyan rushed in, panting, and said, "Someone has fallen into the lake! You have good swimming skills, hurry up and save them!" Without a word, Zhao Boqing rushed to the lake, took off his outer clothes, and dived into the water. He didn't find the person on his first dive and almost got trapped under the ice. Ignoring the danger, he dived into the water again and finally found the fallen boy.

When they pulled the fallen boy out of the water, the child's hands and feet were stiff, and his face was purple. Zhang Yu and Ye Hongwei from the 89th class of the Department of Geography took turns performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on the fallen boy. Jiang Baoguo, a Ph.D. student from the preparatory school for Japan who is well-versed in medicine (a graduate of China Medical University), immediately performed external cardiac massage, but it was ineffective. They then placed the child in a passing car and rushed him to the hospital for emergency treatment. The fallen child ultimately did not survive due to prolonged submersion.

Although the fallen student was not saved, in the approximately 10 minutes before and after the incident, these intellectuals, workers, and students from different schools, ethnicities, and levels quickly formed a self-sacrificing, mutually supportive, and loving fighting group during the rescue. Among the 19 students who jumped into the water to save the boy, there were 9 Ph.D. students and 2 graduate students from the preparatory school for Japan from 11 universities, including Xinjiang University, Beijing University, Shandong University, Nanjing University, and Renmin University of China. There was also 1 graduate student, 3 undergraduates, and 4 junior college students from Northeast Normal University. They demonstrated with their actions that a new generation with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline is growing. This is precisely the hope of our party and country.

　　当代大学生的奉献之歌
　　——东北师大学生抢救落水少年纪实
　　本报记者　李安达
    东北师范大学11月22日召开颁奖大会，授予卡米力等19名大学生“舍己救人优秀学生”荣誉称号，表彰他们用实际行动谱写了一曲当代大学生无私奉献之歌。
    11月11日下午4时零5分，东北师大附中二部放学了。两名初中一年级学生李宁和林长生在校园中边走边蹓足球，一不小心，球滚进了人工湖中心。他们忘记了学校一再宣布的不准踏冰进湖的规定，双双踩着薄冰去湖中拾球。当他们走到离岸20来米的地方，走在前面的李宁突然踩穿冰层，掉进了两米多深的冰窟。
    这时，东北师大留日预备学校学生卡米力·毛依丁（维吾尔族，新疆大学赴日进修生）、克依兰·阿里木汉（哈萨克族，新疆大学赴日进修生）、姜建壮（北京大学化学系硕士毕业生，留日预校博士研究生）刚听完学习江泽民同志国庆讲话的辅导报告要回宿舍。见有人掉进冰窟，急忙奔去抢救。
    卡米力从湖的西岸距落水少年20来米处先跳进湖中，姜建壮匆匆观察地形后，飞快骑车绕到湖心岛上，甩掉大衣，跳入水中，边砸冰边向前游。
    11月中旬的长春，气温零下10摄氏度，冰水刺骨，冻得人浑身发紫。先下湖的卡米力和姜建壮用拳头砸，用胳膊撞，从不同方位向着同一目标破冰前进。全身冻麻木了，手脚被冰碴划破了。不久，卡米力腿部抽筋，开始下沉，同入水中的克依兰只好先把他拖上湖岸。姜建壮经一段猛砸以后也精疲力尽，回到岸边稍事喘息后又继续下水砸冰。这时同班的王立铎（山东大学毕业，留日预校博士研究生）也赶到，两人一同奋力破冰前进。
    救人的呼声传到了离人工湖50来米远的足球场。正在练球的东北师大数学系硕士研究生范德军、地理系89级学生张涌、李有等10人扔下足球，边跑边脱外衣，先后跳入水中，跟姜建壮、王立铎一道，把眼前两三米长的冰层砸开，随即打捞落水少年。
    这天下午，东北师大电化教育系87级学生赵柏庆跟几位同学在第三学生食堂包饺子，只见同班同学吉红岩冲了进来，上气不接下气地说：“有人掉进湖里了，你水性好，赶快去救人！”赵柏庆二话没说，迅即奔往湖边，脱去外衣，一头扎进水中。他第一次潜下水没摸着人，自己险些被冰层封在水下。他全然不顾，第二次又潜下水去，终于摸到了落水少年。
    当他们把落水少年托出水面时，孩子已手脚僵硬，面色紫青。地理系89级学生张羽、叶宏伟轮流为落水少年做人工呼吸；深懂医道的留日预校博士研究生姜保国（中国医科大学毕业）立即做体外心脏按摩，仍不见效。他们随即将儿童抬到一辆过路的汽车上送往医院抢救。落水儿童终因呛水时间过长，未能再睁开双眼。
    落水中学生虽然没抢救过来，但在这前后10来分钟的时间里，这些来自不同学校、不同民族、不同层次的知识分子、工人，在抢救过程中很快形成了一个舍己救人、互助友爱的战斗群体。下水救人的19名同学中，来自新疆大学、北京大学、山东大学、南京大学、中国人民大学等11所学校的9名留日预校的博士生和两名进修生，还有东北师大本校的1名硕士研究生、3名本科生、4名专科生。他们用自己的实际行动说明，有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的一代新人正在成长。而这，正是我们党和国家的希望所在。
