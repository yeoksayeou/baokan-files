Mongolian Party General Secretary and Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Great Hural, Batmonkh, said on October 31 when receiving a reporter from Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun that Mongolia's foreign policy is to maintain friendly relations with all countries and to develop equal and mutually beneficial cooperation on the basis of peaceful coexistence.

Batmonkh pointed out that Mongolia is a developing socialist country and hopes to participate as much as possible in the international division of labor and world economic ties. He said that Mongolian-Soviet cooperation will remain an important factor in Mongolia's socialist construction in the future, but this should not affect Mongolia's development of relations with other countries.

He said that the normalization of Mongolian-Chinese relations not only serves the interests of the peoples of the two countries but also helps to consolidate peace, security, and good-neighborly relations in the Asia-Pacific region.
