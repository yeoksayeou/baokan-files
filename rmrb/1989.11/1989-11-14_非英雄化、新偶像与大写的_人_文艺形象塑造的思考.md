If one were to say that the literary realm of contemporary China has long been marked by a debate between writing about "people" versus writing about "gods," this is not mere fabrication on the author's part. Related to this is the question of whether or not to create, and how to create, socialist heroes and new personages. In recent years, this has been "downgraded" to seemingly having little theoretical and practical significance, and thus not worth mentioning. However, in reality, this is a major literary and aesthetic issue that concerns whether contemporary literature falsely embellishes the supernatural divinity or truthfully portrays the human nature of reality, and concerns the aesthetic direction of contemporary literature.

During the ten-year period of "chaos," the "hero" figures in literary works all possessed a sacred "glory." Literature had become a tool for modern idol creation and worship. In the seventeen years of literary history, the traces of "gods" have occasionally appeared. At that time, a literary trend prevailed, asserting that heroes should all be "tall, perfect, and complete." Therefore, literature, if it did not depict its subjects as flawlessly perfect through "typification," would not be worthy of being called a "heroic image." The problem lies in the fact that the authenticity of such artistic images is extremely limited. As Goethe said, "Perfection is the measure of heaven (God, gods)." Only gods are perfect, while all heroes or new people in the real world are flawed. This is the distinction between gods and humans. Whether or not to write about the flaws of heroes in literary works, and how to write about them, involves the issue of artistic typification methods and artistic taste, and can be left to individual preference. However, in the context of socialist literary concepts, one should abandon the "perfect" measure of gods. Only in this way can the true literary significance of heroic and new personages in works be the aesthetic appreciation of reality rather than the worship of supernatural divinity. If the distinction between heroes (people) and gods is blurred in literary concepts, making that literary "typification principle" tragically become a magical "ladder to heaven" that elevates heroes (people) to the level of gods, this is ironic.

New literature that emerged from the ruins of the ten-year "chaos" period, through its criticism of the so-called "fundamental task" theory and the "three prominences" and similar literary concepts, deepened the emotional disgust and rational awareness of that dream-like idol-worshipping literary view. This great stride in literature is undoubtedly historical. However, in literary concepts, the entanglement between people and gods is not something that can be resolved overnight. People may discard the "tall, perfect" "heroic" image in the morning, but this does not mean that they have truly drawn a clear line between the concept of gods in literary consciousness. The moral outrage against the god-like "perfect" heroes suddenly gave rise to a fondness for "trivial and insignificant" "little people." After the heroic literary view was negated, the theoretical vacuum left in literature seemed destined to be quickly filled by another practical, albeit idol-worshipping, literary slogan. This is the imported so-called literary "de-heroization" and the advocacy of writing about "ordinary people."

Although this "de-heroization" and the literary concept of writing about "ordinary people," which originated from Western modernism, does not represent the entire literary trend of the new era, and although its appearance is a powerful counterbalance and inevitable correction to the traditional "heroic" literary view, it has from the beginning harbored a great theoretical crisis and practical difficulties. Under the banner of advocating the writing of secular ordinary people, it is anti-heroic, anti-ideal, and anti-heroic, which is tantamount to turning revolutionary realism into crawling realism.

This is because, generally speaking, a literary concept, if it is vital, not only may it accept the influence of foreign literary concepts, but it must be born and grow in its own national cultural soil. At a time when the tide of reform and opening up is sweeping across the East, China's contemporary literature's transplantation of Western modernist literary concepts, including the concept of "de-heroization" and writing about "ordinary people," is inevitable. However, this transplantation of literary concepts is carried out under the conditions of the differences in era, nation, and mainly in the level of social production, which constitute the differences between Eastern and Western cultures. The concept of "de-heroization" in Western modernist literature has indeed to some extent broken the dependence on and superstition of gods, and is a cultural awakening that liberates literature from the shackles of traditional divine concepts. However, from the literary concepts implied by the literary vocabulary of "despair," "pain," "ugliness," "humility," and "non-heroic" in Western modernist literature, it mainly belongs to the cultural philosophical level. Moreover, the divine concepts that this literary concept rejects are only certain divine concepts and have not and cannot completely abandon all divine concepts. Its obsession with human insignificance and viewing everything as "absurd" is, in denying both God and humans, actually treating this obsessive literary concept itself as a new idol, which is self-worship in literature. Western modernist literary concepts still retain a certain degree of self-love and self-admiration in the "god" realm. Therefore, when this Western modernist literary view, which contains another kind of divine concept, spreads to the East, it may stir up a loud applause and fervent worship from some "believers" in the internal cultural mechanism. However, due to the actual differences between Eastern and Western cultures, due to the differences in philosophical speculation, and because this "de-heroization" and the literary trend of writing about "ordinary people" are prevalent in the East at a time when the ten-year "chaos" has just ended, the internal and external factors interact, making some people feel that reality has almost no light, and pain and dark emotions fill the heart. They mistake the "pessimism" of the West, which is at the cultural philosophical level, for the tragic reality of contemporary Chinese life. Therefore, some contemporary Chinese modernist poems sing, "I am not a hero / In an era without heroes / I just want to be a person." "The hero dream has faded, this is not an era of heroes," "There have long been no heroes." Therefore, some literary works specialize in ridiculing and despising the heroes in real life as fashionable, and some literary critiques completely negate the heroic spirit and tragic spirit of socialist literature, mistakenly believing that literature only reflects anti-heroic, anti-ideal, and expresses "absurdity," "pessimism," and the "entire theatricality of life" is the so-called "modern literary consciousness."

As mentioned earlier, the "de-heroization" and the literary trend of writing about "ordinary people" in China's new era literature, from the perspective of external cultural transmission, is due to the pursuit and imitation of the "pessimistic" trend of Western modernist literature. Imitation is a sign of immaturity and can also be a form of worship. Worship is simultaneously the deification of the object. That is to say, the cultural essence of this trend in China's new era literature is, to some extent, treating the corresponding thoughts in Western modernist literary concepts as "gods" and thus blindly imitating and following them. Because there is a play called "Waiting for Godot" in Western absurdism, there are a batch of works with "waiting" as the theme here. Because the general aesthetic trend of Western modernist literature is "ugly aesthetics," there are works with "national curses" as "ugly beauty" here. This is an intentional attempt to embarrass the original "sacred" god in literature, but almost to kneel at the feet of the "ugly" god. Some works repeatedly write about "loneliness, these two words are nonsense, but they stubbornly cling to me." "But I am so lonely, so sad that I don't want to drink, don't want to get drunk." We certainly do not need to blame this as the author's meaningless groaning, but their "inspiration" comes from the literary concepts of Western modernism. Similarly, because there are many character soliloquies without any punctuation in some Western "stream-of-consciousness" novels, there are some "new" works in contemporary Chinese literature that follow suit. Joyce once said that the difficulty of understanding his "Finnegans Wake" is to "make critics busy for three hundred years," so some literary critics insist that those "almost unreadable" "new wave" works are not necessarily bad. This eager pursuit of literary imitation, if not supported by some divine concepts, would not have developed to such an extent. It is said that gods claim to create everything, which is a religious creed, but the concept of gods in reality is to stifle all creativity. When some literary divine concepts are hanging over one's head, the development of socialist literature will inevitably be difficult. This is exactly as pointed out in the recently read book "From God to Man" by Zhang Huajiang: history is not the revelation of "gods," but the revelation of humans. Ultimately, literature belongs to "people" and is also an expression of "people."

Since heroes and new people in real life are not "gods" and do not live in the mundane world, they naturally have emotions and desires, and all social relationships can leave their mark on socialist heroes and new people. Therefore, literature should focus on entering from the aspects of people's love, marriage, and morality, and dissect the healthy aesthetic connotations that heroic and new personages should have. Because whether it was the past advocacy of creating "tall, perfect" idol-worshipping literary views or the new era's advocacy of "de-heroization" and writing about confused "gray" little people, neither has actually nor can correctly deal with this complex, important, and sensitive theoretical field. Socialist literature should strive to break away from various "god" entanglements, break through the "god" atmosphere, and create truly realistic "capitalized people," create socialist heroes and new personages that abandon divine concepts. This is a requirement of the socialist modernization cause for socialist literature that is in line with historical requirements and also conforms to the development law of socialist literature itself. In the effort to create the artistic image of "capitalized people," one should dialectically view, analyze, and handle the internal connection between heroes, new people, and ordinary people, especially from the perspective of expanding artistic aesthetic concepts, to argue and affirm the great aesthetic value of the sublime and grandeur of heroes.

    非英雄化、新偶像与大写的“人”
    ——文艺形象塑造的思考
     王振复
    倘若说我国当代文学领域一直存在着写“人”还是写“神”两种不同的文学观念之争，这并非作者的杜撰。与此相联系的，是要不要塑造以及如何塑造社会主义英雄、新人形象，在近年已被“淡化”为似乎没有多少理论和现实意义、因而不值一提的文学与美学老命题。然而实际上，这却是关系到当代文学虚假地粉饰超现实的神性还是真实地表现现实人性、关系到当代文学审美导向的重大文艺理论问题。
    十年“内乱”时期，那些文艺作品中的“英雄”形象，没有一个不具有神圣的“光辉”，文学曾经沦为现代造神、颂神运动的一个工具，在十七年的文学园地里，“神”的踪影也曾时隐时现。那时盛行一种文学思潮，认为凡是英雄都应该是“高大完美”的，因此，文学倘不将它所描绘的对象通过“典型化”写得十全十美，便不配称之为“英雄形象”。问题在于，这种艺术形象的真实性是极有限的。诚如歌德所言“十全十美是上天（上帝、神）的尺度。”（《歌德的格言与感想集》）只有神才十全十美，而凡是现实世俗中的英雄或新人，都是有缺陷的，这便是神与人之间的区别。文学作品中写不写英雄的缺陷以及如何去写，这涉及到艺术典型化方法与艺术趣味问题，可以各听尊便，但是在社会主义的文学观念上，应当摒弃“十全十美”的神的尺度。只有这样，才能使作品中英雄、新人形象的真正文学意义，是对现实人性的审美而不是对超现实神性的崇拜。如果在文学观念上模糊英雄（人）与神之间的区别，使得那种文学“典型化原则”忽然可悲地成了将英雄（人）抬高到神那里去的一架神奇的“天梯”，这是具有讽刺意味的。
    在十年“内乱”文学废墟上起步的新时期文学，通过对所谓“根本任务”论和“三突出”之类文学观念的批判，加深了对那种恶梦般的崇神文学观在感情上的厌恶和理性的自觉，这种大踏步的文学的进取无疑是历史性的。可是在文学观念上，人与神之间的纠葛却不是一朝一夕就可以斩断的。人们也许可以在一个早晨将“高大完美”的“英雄”形象弃之如敝屣，而这并不等于在文学观念意识上从此真正与神的观念划清了界限。对“高大完美”神性“英雄”道德上的愤怒，忽然激起了对“委琐卑微”的“小人物”的偏爱；在“英雄”文学观被否定之后，这个文学理论上留下的空白，似乎注定要很快地被另一种实际也是崇神的文学口号所填补，这便是“舶来”的所谓文学“非英雄化”、写“普通人”的主张与思潮。
    尽管这种源自西方现代主义的“非英雄化”、写“普通人”的文学观念并不等于新时期的整个文学思潮，尽管它的出现对于传统文艺理论中的“英雄”文学观来说，是一个有力的反拨和不可避免的纠偏，然而其本身从一开始就隐伏着巨大的理论上的危机和实践中的困难，在提倡写世俗的普通人的口号下反英雄、反崇高、反理想，就不啻是把革命现实主义弄成了爬行的现实主义。
    这是因为，大凡一种文学观念，如果它是富于生命力的，除了可能接受外来文学观念的影响，它必然是生于斯、长于斯，从本民族的文化土壤里诞生的。在改革开放的大潮席卷东方大地之时，中国当代文学对西方现代主义文学观念其中包括对“非英雄化”、写“普通人”文学思想的移植，自是不可避免，但这种文学观念的移植，却是在时代、民族、主要是在社会生产水平的悬殊所构成的中西文化差别的条件下进行的。西方现代主义文学中的“非英雄化”观念，固然使西方现代文学一定程度上打破了对神的依赖与迷信，使文学从传统神性观念的桎梏中解放的一种文化觉醒，但是，从西方现代主义文学原本高喊的“绝望”、“痛苦”、“丑恶”、“卑微”与“非英雄”等文学词汇所蕴涵的文学观念看，它主要是属于文化哲学意义层次的，而且这种文学观念所摒弃的仅仅是某种神性，并没有也不可能彻底弃绝一切神性观念，它那样偏执于人的渺小将一切存在看作“荒诞”之类，其实在既否定上帝、又否定人的同时，是将这偏执的文学观念本身认作新的偶像，是文学的自我崇拜。西方现代主义文学观念中，仍旧保留着一定的自恋、自爱的“神”的地盘。因此，当这种具有另外一种神性观念的西方现代主义文学观一旦东渐，在文化的内在机制上就可能激起东方一些“信徒”的大声叫好、狂热崇拜。然而由于实际存在的中西文化的差别，由于哲学思辨上的差别，加上这一
  “非英雄化”，写“普通人”的文学思潮在东土盛行之时，正值十年“内乱”之后，因此，内因外因交互作用，在一些人看来，现实生活几乎没有一丝光明，痛苦与黑色的情绪充塞心胸，将西方本是文化哲学层次上的“悲观”，认作中国当代现实人生的悲惨，于是，有些中国当代现代派的诗作这样唱道，“我并不是英雄／在没有英雄的年代里／我只想做一个人。”“英雄梦也剥落了，这不是个英雄的年代”、“早就没有什么英雄了”。于是，有些文学作品专门以嘲讽、鄙弃现实生活中的英雄为时髦，有些文学评论由此彻底否定社会主义文学的英雄精神和悲剧精神，误以为文学只有反英雄、反崇高、表现“荒诞”、“悲观”、“生活的全部作戏感”，才是所谓“文学的现代意识”。
    正如前述，我国新时期文学中的一股“非英雄化”，写“普通人”的文学思潮，从文化传播的外因角度看，是由于对西方现代主义文学“悲观”思潮的追随与模仿而来。凡模仿是幼稚的表现，也可以是对前者的崇拜。凡崇拜，同时就是对客观对象的神化。就是说，我国新时期文学中的这一股思潮的文化实质，某种程度上是将西方现代主义文学观念中相应的思想看作“神”，从而对其一味模仿、亦步亦趋。因为西方荒诞派戏剧中有一出《等待戈多》，才有我们这里以“等待”为主题的一批作品，因为西方现代主义文学观念一般是以“审丑”为美学趋向的，才有我们这里以“国骂”为“丑美”的作品问世。这是有意在给文学中原先那个圣洁的“神”以难堪，不料几乎又要拜倒在“恶俗恶俗的”那个“丑”神的脚下了。有些作品翻来复去地写“孤独这两个字虽然扯淡，可又死乞白赖地缠着我。”“可我孤独得要命，愁得不想喝酒，不想醉什么的。”我们固然不必责备这是作者无病呻吟，其“灵感”却是来自西方现代主义的文学观念。同样，因有某些西方“意识流”小说大量人物独白不加任何标点符号在前，才有我国当代文坛的某些“新”作尾随其后。乔伊斯曾经说过，他的《费尼根的苏醒》的晦涩难懂程度，要“让评论家瞎忙三百年”，于是又有一些文艺评论者坚持认为那些“几乎是难以识读”的“新潮”作品未必就是要不得的。这种趋之若鹜般的文学模仿，如果不是由于某种神性观念的支撑，也就不会发展到如此程度。据说神标榜自己创造一切，这是宗教的信条，现实中的神的观念却是扼杀一切创造性的。当某种文学的神性观念高悬在头顶时，社会主义文学的发展必将举步维艰。这恰如最近读到的张怀久所著《从神到人》一书所指出的那样：历史不是“神”的启示，而是人的启示，归根结底，文学是属于“人”，同时又是表现“人”的。
    现实生活中的英雄、新人既然不是“神”，不是不食人间烟火，当然便有七情六欲，一切社会关系都可以在社会主义英雄、新人身上打上烙印，因此，文艺要着重从人的爱情、婚姻、道德角度切入，剖析英雄、新人形象应有的健康的美学意蕴。因为无论过去主张塑造“高大完美”的崇神文学观，还是新时期标榜“非英雄化”、写浑浑噩噩“灰色”小人物的文学观，都未能实际上也不可能正确对待这个复杂、重要而又敏感的理论领域。社会主义文学应当努力摆脱种种“神”的纠缠、突破“神”的氛围而塑造真正现实的“大写的人”，塑造那种摒弃神性观念的社会主义英雄、新人形象，是社会主义现代化事业对社会主义文艺所提出的合乎历史要求，也符合社会主义文艺的自身发展规律。在努力塑造“大写的人”的艺术形象时，应当辩证地看待、分析与处理英雄、新人与普通人之间的内在联系，尤其从艺术审美观念的拓展角度，论证和肯定英雄的崇高与壮美的巨大审美价值。
