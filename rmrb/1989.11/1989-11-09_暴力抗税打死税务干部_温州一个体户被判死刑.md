The judicial authorities in Wenzhou have swiftly dealt with a severe case involving an individual merchant who violently resisted taxation and killed a tax official. The culprit, Jing Xuxiu, was today sentenced to death with deprivation of political rights for life by the High People's Court of Zhejiang Province.

On the morning of October 29, the director of the Small South Tax Collection Station in Wenzhou's Luqing District, Jiang Baqing, along with two tax collectors, went to the Ma'anchi Agricultural Market to collect taxes. When they reached the stall of the individual merchant Jing Xuxiu, who dealt in aquatic products, Jing, citing high tax rates, began to curse and resist the tax collection. The three tax officials insisted that Jing pay the tax, but Jing rushed out of his stall and attacked one of the tax collectors. The station director, Jiang Baqing, stepped in to stop the assault, but Jing viciously punched and kicked Jiang, causing him to collapse and lose consciousness on the spot. Despite emergency treatment, Jiang died on duty.

Following the incident, Wenzhou's public security, procuratorial, and judicial authorities swiftly organized efforts to apprehend Jing, who was then brought to justice. After a public trial, the court found that the defendant Jing's actions constituted the crime of intentional homicide, with particularly severe circumstances, and thus deserved severe punishment.
