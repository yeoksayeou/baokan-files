The Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has established the policy of further rectification and deepening reform. Fully leveraging the role of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises is a crucial aspect of implementing this policy. Years of practice have shown us that only by firmly establishing the idea of improving large and medium-sized enterprises can we stabilize the overall national economy, enhance the country's economic strength and gradually achieve modernization, and truly help large and medium-sized enterprises overcome difficulties and develop.

There are more than ten thousand large and medium-sized enterprises in China, which account for 70% of the country's fixed assets and 62.8% of realized taxes and profits, playing a pivotal role in the national economy. However, they are currently facing considerable difficulties. The business community has been saying for years that the current situation is like "a monkey climbing a tree, a tiger in a cage, and a lion in chains." This refers to the fact that township enterprises and "three types of enterprises" are becoming more active, while military industrial enterprises are facing operational difficulties. As the "king of beasts," large and medium-sized enterprises are facing numerous constraints. According to statistics, in 1988, the tax burden for large enterprises was 87.13%, for small enterprises 78.55%, for collective enterprises 72.53%, and for township enterprises 40%. The Tianjin Bicycle Factory and eleven other enterprises, along with enterprises in the Water and Electricity Department, handed over taxes, profits, and fees totaling 90% of the total tax and profit amount. The planned tasks are set very high, and the products are all taken away, leaving the enterprises with no products to sell on their own. Enterprises cannot directly access the international market, and the foreign exchange retention for enterprises is very low, while the foreign exchange rate is lower than the cost of exporting and earning foreign exchange. This year, due to shortages in energy, fuel, transportation, funds, and foreign exchange, large and medium-sized enterprises are facing even greater difficulties. Since this autumn, product sales have stagnated. Even a large factory like the Second Automobile Works, which has been selling well since September, has seen a decline in sales of East Wind trucks. The sales volume in October was 83% of the average sales volume of the previous few months. The realized profit from January to September was 17% less than the same period last year. Whether it is the "five shortages" or product sales stagnation, large and medium-sized enterprises are the first to bear the brunt and face greater difficulties.

How can we fully leverage the role of large and medium-sized enterprises? I believe that the practice of reform over the past decade has given us the following insights:

	(1) We must persist in, improve, and develop the contract responsibility system to revitalize large and medium-sized enterprises, enabling them to have the ability to accumulate, invest, and develop on their own.

	The manager of Yanshan Petrochemical Company, Wu Xiegang, put it clearly: "Whether an enterprise has vitality cannot be simply measured by its current economic benefits. The most essential indicator of an enterprise's vitality is whether it can respond and make correct decisions in a timely manner according to changes in the external political and economic environment, and maintain its self-accumulation and self-development capabilities." One of the advantages of the contract responsibility system is to ensure that the enterprise has the ability to accumulate and develop on its own. Shougang (Capital Steel) has been under contract for ten years, contributing 7 billion yuan to the state, increasing fixed assets by 2.6 billion yuan, and contributing a total of 9.6 billion yuan to the state. Without spending a single penny of state investment, the annual steel production increased from 1.169 million tons to 3.142 million tons, an increase of 168.7%, doubling and a half. The realized profit increased by 20% annually, and the capital and tax rate in 1988 reached 60.62%. Shougang used its own funds to increase investment by 2.9 billion yuan over ten years, increasing realized taxes by 6.032 billion yuan, with an input-output ratio of 1:2.06, which is 6 times higher than the national investment benefit. In 1988, the labor productivity per person was 2.6 times higher than ten years ago, and it far exceeded the increase in labor productivity of some steel enterprises in developed countries. The contract period of enterprises like the Second Automobile Works, Pangang (Panzhihua Steel), and Jiamusi Paper Mill is about ten years, and they have also achieved outstanding results. Even the eight enterprises in the Beijing Machinery Industry that implemented the contract in 1987 invested 1.69 billion yuan in technological transformation in two years, an increase of 111.6% compared to the two years before the contract, and the net value of fixed assets increased by 16%.

	The contract responsibility system does not require the state to reduce taxes or profits. It takes the amount of income tax or profit paid in the previous year or the average of the previous three years as the base, and it gradually increases year by year, ensuring rather than reducing fiscal revenue. It is a mechanism for socialist enterprises to continuously tap potential and fully leverage their advantages. This mechanism is a concrete manifestation of the compatibility of the interests of the state, the enterprise, and the workers.

	Because the enterprise contract responsibility system is conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of enterprises and workers to develop production, it should be continued. At the same time, we should seriously summarize practical experience, eliminate disadvantages, and continuously improve and develop it. In recent years, the Shougang-style contract has achieved relatively good results. Their main practices are as follows: 1. "Fixed quota, surplus retained." 2. Full staff contract, not individual contract. 3. The contract period is at least five years. 4. The production development fund accounts for 60% of the retained profits. 5. The total wage and realized tax and profit are linked. 6. There is a certain right to sell products independently. Of course, various regions should also actively explore various contract forms to correctly handle the relationship between the state and enterprises according to their actual situations, and carry out pilot projects in a planned and step-by-step manner.

	(2) We should formulate policies to prioritize the development of large enterprises, and tilt resources such as funds, foreign exchange, energy, raw materials, and transportation towards large and medium-sized enterprises.

	China has a large population, and it is necessary to appropriately develop township enterprises and collective enterprises to solve employment problems. However, we must be clear that large and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the national economy and must be prioritized for development.

	According to the 1985 industrial census data, compared with small enterprises, large and medium-sized enterprises have a labor productivity that is 52.2% higher, a per capita tax and profit creation that is 138.9% higher, a per 100 yuan total product material consumption that is 110% lower, and a sales income cost that is 11.3% lower. Among them, large enterprises are superior to medium-sized enterprises, with an average per capita output value of 1.24:1 and an average per capita tax and profit creation of 1.57:1. In the steel industry, the labor productivity of large enterprises in 1987 was 24,993 yuan per person per year, which is 1.32 times higher than the industry average of 18,914 yuan.

	Prioritizing the development of large enterprises is a common trend in both developed countries and developing countries. In 1987, the pure profit of the six major enterprise groups in Japan accounted for 11.88% of the industrial sector, and their sales volume accounted for 14.35%. In 1983, the business volume of the 50 major enterprise groups in South Korea was almost equivalent to the national GDP. In the United States, Japan, West Germany, the automobile, steel, electrical machinery, machinery, and chemical industries, the top four companies control 3/4 of the industry's production. South Korea has achieved rapid economic development by relying on large enterprises. They provide low-interest loans and financial subsidies to large enterprises, exempt imported equipment from tariffs, and give preferential exchange rates. They encourage large enterprises to develop vertically and horizontally, becoming comprehensive enterprise groups across industries.

	Modern socialized large-scale production must rely on large enterprises as the backbone. The General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler automobile companies in the United States each produce tens of millions of cars annually, even approaching a hundred million. In contrast, more than a hundred automobile assembly plants in China produce only tens of millions of cars annually. After the war, Japan built more than a dozen steel plants, with four of them having an annual production capacity of over 100 million tons. Among them, 99% of pig iron is produced by the five major steel companies. In China, there are more than a thousand steel plants at the county level and above, none of which have reached a scale of 100 million tons. The pig iron production of medium and small steel enterprises accounts for 30% of the country's total. China's foreign trade must transition from exporting raw materials and primary products to exporting deeply processed products and mechanical and electrical products. To achieve this, we must prioritize supporting large enterprises, improving their scale, technology, and equipment, and encouraging the emergence of some world-class large enterprises.

	(3) Let large enterprises face the international market, experience the storms, and grow rapidly.

	Almost all enterprises in developed countries have the right to engage in foreign trade. From their inception, they have targeted the international market and been in competition, forcing them to improve technology and product quality. During the rectification and adjustment process, we should, under the premise of ensuring the continuous development of the country's foreign trade, insist on and improve policies and measures to encourage exports, and effectively solve the difficulties in the export production of key regions, key industries, and key products, giving large and medium-sized enterprises some convenience in foreign trade. The petroleum and chemical industry expert Wu Xiegang pointed out that when the international market price of crude oil dropped to $12 per barrel, we could import crude oil for processing. The price of polypropylene was $1,200 to $1,400 per ton in 1988, but it dropped to $900 per ton this year. Due to the lack of foreign trade autonomy, we missed this opportunity. The general manager of Shanghai Jinshan Petrochemical Plant, Wang Jimin, pointed out that the plant is located in Jinshanwei, where ships can dock directly, and the entire plant has a technical team of more than ten thousand people, with certain potential in manpower and equipment. If they were given foreign trade autonomy, they could import crude oil, process, and export, earning processing foreign exchange.

	In the 1990s, China will enter the peak period of foreign debt repayment. We should be prepared and, while promoting export-oriented development, also promote import substitution. We import tens of millions of tons of steel and a large amount of chemical raw materials annually, consuming a large amount of foreign exchange. We should formulate a plan to achieve self-sufficiency in steel, chemical raw materials, automobiles, color TVs, refrigerator parts, and other products within two to three years, and invite bids from enterprises nationwide. The winning bidders will be supported by the state in terms of funds, foreign exchange, and other aspects. Only in this way can we effectively reduce the trade deficit and turn it into a surplus, using it to repay foreign debts.

    充分发挥大中型企业的骨干作用
    杨培新
    党的十三届五中全会确定了进一步治理整顿和深化改革的方针，充分发挥国营大中型企业的骨干作用是贯彻这一方针的重要内容。多年来的实践告诉我们，只有牢固树立搞好大中型企业的思想，才能稳定国民经济全局，才能增强国家经济实力和逐步实现现代化，才能真正为大中型企业排忧解难，帮助他们发展。
    我国大中型企业一万多家，占有全国固定资产的70％，占实现利税的62.8％，在国民经济中，居于举足轻重的地位，但是目前却处在十分困难的境地。企业界前些年就流传这样一句话，现在的企业形势是“猴子上树，老虎入笼，狮子受捆”。这里指的是乡镇企业、“三资”企业开始活跃起来，军工企业经营困难，作为百兽之王的大中型企业受着重重束缚。据统计1988年大企业税负为87.13％，小企业税负78.55％，集体企业税负72.53％，乡镇企业税负40％。天津自行车厂等十一个企业和水电部系统企业，上交税、利、费共达税利总额的90％。计划任务打得很满，产品全部拿走，企业没有产品可供自销。企业不能和国际市场直接接触，企业外汇留成很低，外汇牌价又低于出口换汇成本。今年以来，由于能源、燃料、运输、资金、外汇紧缺，大中型企业更处在艰难的境地。今年秋季以来，产品滞销，就是第二汽车制造厂这样的大厂，进入9月份以来一直畅销不衰的东风卡车销售也开始疲软，10月份的销售量，为前几个月平均销售额的83％，1—9月实现利润较去年同期减少17％。无论是“五紧缺”还是产品滞销，大中型企业都首当其冲，承担着更大的困难。
    怎样才能充分发挥大中企业的骨干作用？我认为，改革十年来的实践给我们的启示是：
      （一）必须通过坚持、完善、发展承包制，搞活大中型企业，使之具有自我积累、自我投资、自我发展的能力。
    燕山石化公司经理吴协刚说的很透彻：“一个企业是否有活力，不能简单地用眼前经济效益去衡量。企业活力最本质的标志是看它能否根据外部政治经济环境的变化，而及时作出正确的反应和决策，始终保持应有的自我积累和自我发展能力。”承包制的优越性之一，就是确保企业有自我积累和自我发展能力。首钢承包十年，上交国家70亿元，新增固定资产26亿元，共为国家贡献96亿元。没花国家一文投资，钢材年产量由116.9万吨增加到314.2万吨，增长168.7％，翻了一番半。实现利润年递增20％，资金利税率1988年高达60.62％。首钢十年用自有资金增加投资29亿元，新增利税60.32亿元，投入产出为1∶2.06之比，高于全国投资效益的6倍。1988年全员劳动生产率比10年前提高2.6倍，而且大大超过世界上一些发达国家的钢铁企业提高的幅度。承包时间在十年左右的二汽、攀钢、佳木斯造纸厂等，也创造了优异的成绩。就是1987年才推行承包的北京机械工业八户，两年投入技术改造的资金达1.69亿元，比承包前两年增长111.6％，固定资产净值增长16％。
    承包制并不需要国家让税让利。它以上年或前三年上交所得税或利润额为基数，而且承担逐年递增，是保障而不是减少财政收入。它是用“包死上交，放开一头”，允诺超额利润归企业，形成自我积累自我发展能力。这是社会主义企业不断挖掘潜力、充分发挥其优越性的机制。这种机制是社会主义企业国家、企业、职工三者利益兼顾的具体表现。
    因为企业承包经营责任制，有利于调动企业和职工发展生产的积极性，所以应当继续坚持。同时，又要认真总结实践经验，兴利除弊，不断加以完善和发展。近几年，首钢式的承包取得了较好的效果，它们的主要做法是6点：1、“包死定额，超收全留”。2、全员承包，而不是个人承包。3、承包期限至少在五年以上。4、留利分配中生产发展基金占60％。5、工资总额和实现税利挂钩。6、有一定的产品自销权利。当然，各地区还应当根据实际情况，积极探索正确处理国家和企业关系的多种承包形式，并有领导有步骤地进行试点。
      （二）要制定优先发展大企业，在资金、外汇、能源、原料、运输等多方面向大中企业倾斜的政策。
    我国人口众多，必须适当发展乡镇企业、集体企业以解决就业问题，但必须清醒地看到大中企业是国民经济的骨干，必须优先发展。
    根据1985年工业普查资料，大中型企业和小型企业相比，全员劳动生产率高出52.2％，人均创税利高出138.9％，百元总产值物耗低110％，销售收入成本低11.3％。其中，大型企业又优越于中型企业，每人平均产值为1.24∶1，每人平均创税利为1.57∶1。钢铁行业，大企业全员劳动生产率1987年为每人每年24993元，高于全行业平均水平的18914元，为其1.32倍。
    优先发展大企业，是发达国家和发展中国家的共同趋势。1987年日本六大企业集团纯利占产业界的11.88％，销售额占14.35％。南朝鲜50个大企业集团营业额，1983年几乎相当于全国国民生产总值。美国、日本、西德的汽车、钢铁、电机、机械、化工等行业，排在前面的四家大公司控制该行业产量的3／4。南朝鲜依靠大企业实现了经济快速发展，他们对大企业给以低息贷款、财政补贴，其进口设备免征关税，并在汇率上给以优惠。既鼓励大企业纵向发展，又鼓励它横向发展，成为跨行业的综合性企业集团。
    现代社会化大生产，必然以大企业为骨干。美国的通用、福特、克来斯勒汽车公司每家每年产汽车数百万辆，甚至近千万辆。而我国百十多个汽车总装厂年产汽车仅几十万辆。日本战后突建的十几个钢铁厂，年生产能力达1000万吨以上的就有四家。其中99％的生铁由五大钢铁公司生产。而我国县以上钢铁厂千余家，无一达到1000万吨规模。中小钢铁企业的生铁产量竟占全国30％。我国外贸要由出口原料、初级产品过渡到出口深度加工产品、机电产品，就必须优先扶植大企业，提高其企业规模、技术和装备，鼓励出现一些世界级的大型企业。
      （三）让大企业到国际市场上去经风雨，见世面，加速其成长。
    发达国家几乎所有企业都有外贸自主权，自其出生之日起，就瞄准国际市场，置身于竞争之中，强制其提高技术，提高产品质量。我们在治理整顿过程中，要在努力保证全国对外贸易持续发展的前提下，坚持并改进鼓励出口的政策措施，切实解决重点地区、重点行业和重点产品出口生产中的困难，给大中型企业外贸以适当的方便。石油化工企业家吴协刚指出，当国际市场原油降到每桶12美元时，我们完全可以进口原油进行加工。聚丙烯1988年每吨1200至1400美元，今年降为每吨900美元。由于企业没有外贸自主权，而坐失良机。上海金山石化总厂厂长王基铭指出，该厂设在金山卫，船舶可以直接靠岸，全厂拥有一万多人的科技队伍，人力、装备均有一定的潜力，如果给他们以外贸自主权，就可以进口原油、加工出口，赚取加工外汇。
    90年代，我国将进入外债还债高峰，我们要未雨绸缪，既要搞出口导向，更要搞进口代替。我们每年进口钢材达千万吨，以及大量化工原料，耗费大量外汇。我们应制定在两三年内达到钢材、化工原料、汽车、彩电、冰箱零部件等自给的计划，向全国企业招标，中标者由国家给以资金、外汇等方面支持。这样，才能有效缩减进出口贸易逆差，使之转为顺差，用以偿还外债。
