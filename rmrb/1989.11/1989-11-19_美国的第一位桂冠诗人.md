    The first Poet Laureate of the United States, Robert Penn Warren, a renowned American literary figure known for his outstanding achievements and wide influence in the fields of novels, poetry, and criticism, passed away from cancer on September 15 in Stratton, Vermont. He was 84 years old.

    Over a 50-year writing career, Warren published more than 50 works and won three Pulitzer Prizes. He also received the National Medal for Literature, the Poetry Gold Medal from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the Bollingen Prize for Poetry, among other prestigious American literary awards. He was the first Poet Laureate of the United States.

    Warren's novel "All the King's Men," published in 1946, is a scathing critique of contemporary politics and solidified his place in American literary history. The novel is based on the life of Louisiana state senator and governor Huey Long and portrays the corrupt politician Willie Stark, who is cunning, greedy, and manipulative. The book caused a sensation upon its release and won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction the following year. In 1949, it was adapted into a film by Columbia Pictures titled "All the King's Men," which won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Other notable novels by Warren include "Night Rider," "At Heaven's Gate," "All the King's Men," and "The Cave."

    As one of the leading poets of contemporary American literature, Warren's poetic achievements surpass his contributions to novels. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry twice: in 1957 for "Promises: Poems, 1954-1956" and in 1979 for "Now and Then: Poems 1976-1978." Warren was the first writer to win both the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and Poetry. In 1945, he was appointed as the official poetry consultant to the Library of Congress. In 1986, Congress established the position of Poet Laureate of the United States, and Warren was unanimously appointed as the first Poet Laureate, serving a one-year term. Richard Wilbur was the second Poet Laureate, and Howard Nemerov was the third.

    Warren's literary criticism is closely linked to his 43-year teaching career. After returning from Oxford University in 1930, Warren began teaching English and American literature at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and joined the famous "Agrarian" literary group, actively advocating for the benefits of traditional Southern agriculture and the drawbacks of modern industry. Later, while teaching at Louisiana State University, he founded the influential "Southern Review." His most influential works of literary criticism are "Understanding Poetry" and "Understanding Fiction," co-authored with his colleague Cleanth Brooks. For over 40 years, these two books have been required reading in English and American literature courses at various universities. Additionally, in the 1940s, he helped establish the position of New Criticism.

    Warren was born in the small town of Guthrie, Kentucky, in the South, into a family of scholars. During his university years, he and some friends who loved literature formed the "Fugitives" group, criticizing the religiously influenced literary traditions of the American South. He left his hometown in his twenties and never returned to live in the South, but his poetry and novels are deeply rooted in the customs, people, and historical realities of the South. He initially supported racial segregation in the South but later renounced his views. Therefore, he is generally regarded as an outstanding representative of Southern literature.

    美国的第一位桂冠诗人
    陆文岳
    在小说、诗歌和评论领域均有卓越建树和广泛影响的美国大文豪罗伯特·佩恩·沃伦，因癌症不治，于9月15日在佛蒙特州斯特拉顿镇去世，终年84岁。
    在50多年的著述生涯中，沃伦发表了50多部著作，3次荣获普利策奖，并得过国家文学勋章、美国文学艺术学院诗歌金奖，以及全国书评奖和博林根诗歌奖等一系列美国最有声望的文学奖。他又是美国第一位桂冠诗人。
    奠定他在美国文学史上地位的是发表于1946年的鞭挞时政的小说《国王人马》。此书以南方路易斯安那州人民党参议员和州长休伊·朗为原型，塑造了精于权术、迷于财欲、结帮营私、作威作诡的卑鄙政客威利的丑恶形象。小说面世后即引起轰动，翌年荣获普利策小说奖。1949年由哥伦比亚公司拍成电影《当代奸雄》，并夺得最佳影片等三项奥斯卡大奖。沃伦的其他较有影响的小说有：《夜骑者》、《天堂之门》、《一群天使》和《洞穴》等。
    作为当代美国诗坛数一数二的大诗人，沃伦的诗歌地位显然要高于其小说地位。他两次获普利策诗歌奖。一次是1957年，获奖作品是《希望诗集，1954—1956》。另一次是1979年，得奖作品为《此时彼地：1976—1978诗作》。沃伦是第一位荣获普利策小说和诗歌双奖的作家。1945年，他被聘为官方的国会图书馆诗歌顾问。1986年，国会批准设立美国桂冠诗人职位，沃伦以无可争议的资格被任命为首任桂冠诗人，任期一年。第二任桂冠诗人是理查德·威伯。今年获选的第三位桂冠诗人是霍华德·涅米洛夫。
    沃伦的文学评论成就是和他的43年教授生涯密切相联的。1930年从牛津大学留学归来后，沃伦即到田纳西州西南学院教英美文学，同时加入了有名的“重农派”文学团体，积极著文鼓吹美国南方的传统农业经济的好处和现代工业的弊病，后来在路易斯安那州立大学任教时创办了名噪一时的
  《南方评论》。他的影响最大的诗文评著是与同事克利斯·布鲁克斯合写的《理解诗歌》和《理解小说》。40多年来，这两本书一直被各大学选为英美文学专业的必修课本。另外，他在40年代还帮助确立了新批评主义的地位。
    沃伦出生于南方肯塔基州左思里小城的一个书香门第，大学时代与一些爱好文学的朋友成立了“逃亡者”团体，对美国南方的宗教色彩浓厚的文学传统进行了批判。他20多岁离开故乡后，就再未回南方居住，但是他的诗文小说却根植于南方的风土人情和历史现实。他早年赞成南方的种族隔离，但后来又自我否定。因此，一般人都把他看作美国南方派小说家的杰出代表。
