The First Committee of the 44th UN General Assembly (the Political and Security Committee) unanimously adopted a resolution proposed by China today, urging the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the two major military blocs, to reach an agreement on conventional disarmament as soon as possible.

This draft resolution calls on countries that bear special responsibility for reducing conventional armaments, possess the largest military arsenals, and are members of the two major military blocs to continue their negotiations to reach an agreement on establishing a low-level, stable, and reliable balance of conventional armaments and forces in their respective regions, especially in Europe, where weapons and troops are most concentrated, under effective international supervision.

The draft also encourages all countries to take appropriate actions to promote conventional disarmament while ensuring security, and to strengthen peace and security.

The draft notes that resources freed up through disarmament, including conventional disarmament, can be used for the social and economic development of all countries, especially developing countries.

This draft resolution will be submitted to the 44th UN General Assembly for approval.
