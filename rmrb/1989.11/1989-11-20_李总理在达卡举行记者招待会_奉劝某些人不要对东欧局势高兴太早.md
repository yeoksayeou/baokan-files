Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, November 19th.

Premier Li Peng today warned certain individuals not to rejoice too soon over the situation in Eastern Europe.

Premier Li made these remarks at a press conference held in Dhaka as he concluded his official friendly visit to Bangladesh. He stated: "The system a country adopts should be chosen by its people and determined by its historical context and national conditions. China has never interfered in the internal affairs of other countries or in the internal affairs of other parties. China has chosen the socialist system and has the support of the vast majority of the Chinese people. We will continue to adhere to it steadfastly. However, the socialist system needs reform to make it more perfect and to better demonstrate its superiority."

Li Peng said: "China is also concerned about the situation in Europe. We need to observe calmly how the situation will develop and whether it will be beneficial to peace or contain elements of instability. According to current news reports, the European Community is holding emergency consultations. In early December, Bush and Gorbachev will meet in the Mediterranean. This shows that they also feel the need to consult on this sudden and dramatic change in the situation. He said, regarding this change, some people are both happy and worried, or happy with some worry. I advise them not to be too happy too soon."

Li Peng said: "I cannot say that this change in the situation will not affect China. However, I can responsibly tell everyone that China's situation is stable. China will continue to follow the socialist path, and this will not waver."

In response to a reporter's question about the situation in Cambodia, Li Peng said: "China not only supports the Khmer Rouge but also supports the Cambodian resistance forces, which are composed of three factions, including Sihanouk and Son Sann. Their supreme leader is Sihanouk. He said, China supports the Cambodian resistance forces because Vietnam has invaded Cambodia. Regardless of what happens in Cambodia, it is unacceptable for another country to invade and interfere. China does not seek any private interests in Cambodia but hopes that Cambodia will become a peaceful, independent, and neutral country. Li Peng said, China has two proposals for a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian issue: first, Vietnam must withdraw all its troops from Cambodia and this withdrawal must be supervised by the United Nations; second, a temporary coalition government of the four Cambodian factions should be formed. I would like to remind reporters that if it is not a coalition of the four, then Cambodia will become a second Afghanistan."

When a reporter asked Premier Li to comment on the Dalai Lama receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, Li Peng said, "We are puzzled by the decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama. This is an interference in China's internal affairs."

Regarding the situation in South Asia, Li Peng said, "China is concerned about the recent tensions that have arisen between some South Asian countries. In December last year, when Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi visited China, we reaffirmed our commitment to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which were jointly advocated by China and India. India is a major country in South Asia, and we hope that India will resolve all disputes with its neighbors through peaceful consultations in accordance with these principles."

Li Peng reiterated that China will continue to steadfastly implement the policy of reform and opening up. He said: "China's reform is a perfection of the socialist system, not a negation of the socialist system. We are not turning the socialist economy into a market economy but are using market regulation to promote economic development. Some economists and political leaders in the world, including some in China, believe that the more market elements there are, the deeper the reform will be. This view is at least not accurate for China. We combine planned economy with market regulation. Li Peng said, China will continue to open up because it benefits us. China will not open the door and then close it again. When talking about the achievements of this visit to Bangladesh, Li Peng said, his talks with President Ershad were successful and will further promote the development of friendly cooperation between the two countries.

    李总理在达卡举行记者招待会
    奉劝某些人不要对东欧局势高兴太早
    本报达卡11月19日电　记者史宗星报道：李鹏总理今天在这里奉劝某些人，不要对东欧的局势高兴太早。
    李鹏是在他结束对孟加拉国正式友好访问时在记者招待会上表明这一看法的。他说：一个国家实行什么制度，应由这个国家的人民作出选择，而且是由这个国家的历史情况和国情来决定的。中国从来不干涉其他国家的内政和其他党派的内部事务。中国选择了社会主义制度，而且得到了绝大多数中国人民的拥护，我们将坚定不移地实行下去。但是，社会主义制度要进行改革，使它完善，使它发挥更大的优越性。
    李鹏说：中国对欧洲的形势也感到关注。这种形势向什么方向发展，对和平有利还是包含着不安定因素，我们还要冷静地观察一下。根据现在的新闻报道，欧洲共同体正在进行紧急磋商。12月初，布什和戈尔巴乔夫要在地中海上举行会晤。这说明，目前出现的这种急剧变化的形势，他们也觉得需要磋商了。他说，对于这种变化，有些人是又喜又忧，或者说是喜中有忧。我奉劝他们，不要高兴得太早。
    李鹏说：我不能说这种形势变化对中国不会产生影响。但是，我可以负责地告诉大家，中国的局势是稳定的。中国要坚持走社会主义道路，这一点是不会动摇的。
    在回答记者关于柬埔寨问题的提问时，李鹏说：中国不仅仅是支持红色高棉，而是支持柬埔寨抵抗力量，他们由3个方面组成，有西哈努克，有宋双，他们的最高领导人是西哈努克。他说，中国之所以支持柬埔寨抵抗力量，是因为越南对柬埔寨进行了侵略。不管柬埔寨发生了什么事情，另一个国家去侵略，去干涉，这是不能允许的。中国不谋求在柬埔寨有什么私利，只是希望柬埔寨成为一个和平、独立和中立的国家。李鹏说，中国对全面政治解决柬埔寨有两条主张：一是越南从柬埔寨全部撤军，而且要由联合国监督；二是组成柬埔寨四方临时联合政府。我想提醒记者先生们注意，如果不是四方的联合，那么，柬埔寨将成为第二个阿富汗。
    当有记者要李总理就达赖获诺贝尔和平奖一事发表评论时，李鹏说，我们对把诺贝尔和平奖授予达赖感到迷惑不解，这是对中国内政的干涉。
    关于南亚地区形势，李鹏说，中国对南亚国家间目前出现的某些紧张局势感到关切。去年12月，拉·甘地总理到中国访问时，我们双方再一次重申了要遵守由中印两国共同倡导的和平共处五项原则。印度是南亚地区的一个大国，我们希望印度能够按照这样的原则，用和平协商的办法解决它和邻国之间的一切争端。
    李鹏重申，中国将继续坚定不移地实行改革开放政策。他说：中国实行改革，是对社会主义制度的一种完善，而不是对社会主义制度的否定。我们不是要把社会主义的经济完全变成市场经济，而是利用市场调剂来促进经济发展。现在世界有些经济学家，包括一些政界领导人，认为市场经济成份越大，改革就越深入，这种认识至少对中国来说是不准确的。我们是把计划经济和市场调剂相结合。李鹏说，中国继续实行开放，因为对外开放对我们有好处。中国不会把自己打开的大门又自己把它关上。谈到这次访孟的成果时，李鹏说，他和艾尔沙德总统的会谈是成功的，会进一步推进两国之间友好合作关系的发展。
