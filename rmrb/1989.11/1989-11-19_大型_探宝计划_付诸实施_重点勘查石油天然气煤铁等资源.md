A major "treasure hunting plan" centered around geological prospecting has been approved by the State Planning Commission and will be implemented by the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources. This comes at a time when people are increasingly concerned that mineral resources may constrain the development of the national economy.

According to the plan, in the field of energy minerals, the focus will be on significantly strengthening the exploration of oil and natural gas resources. Over the next 12 years, the increase in proven oil reserves is expected to equal the total proven reserves of the past 40 years. For natural gas, this increase is projected to be 5.8 times the amount discovered in the past 40 years. The plan also aims to expand the proven reserves of coal fields and continue the search for high-grade, large-scale uranium deposits with favorable development conditions.

To meet the needs of the steel industry, the emphasis will be on finding iron and manganese deposits with high grades and favorable development conditions. Additionally, efforts will be made to strengthen research in mineral processing and metallurgy to improve the utilization of existing low-grade iron and difficult-to-process manganese reserves.

    大型“探宝计划”付诸实施
    重点勘查石油天然气煤铁等资源
    据新华社北京11月18日电 （通讯员王秀文、记者赵明亮）正当人们日益担心矿产资源将制约国民经济发展时，一项以地质找矿为中心的、宏伟的“探宝计划”，日前经国家计委批准，并由地质矿产部负责实施。
    根据计划，在能源矿产中，首先要大力加强石油、天然气资源的勘查，今后12年石油增加的探明储量要等于过去40年探明储量的总和；天然气相当于过去40年的5.8倍；要扩大煤田精查储量，继续寻找品位高，规模大和开发条件好的铀矿。
    为满足钢铁工业的需求，要着重找品位富和开发条件好的铁和锰矿。同时，加强选冶工作的研究，提高对已有贫铁、难选锰矿储量的利用程度。
