The Colombia National Art Restoration Center, established in August 1974, is the first art "clinic" in Latin America. Over the past 15 years, more than a thousand pieces of art treasures, including a number of world-famous paintings and valuable historical relics, have been restored to their former glory here. In 1981, the center established a school for the protection, restoration, and museum studies, training professionals in this field. To date, 35 graduates have entered the workforce. The image shows staff at the restoration center working on the restoration of the wall paintings in the Saint Clare Church in Bogota, which has a history of over 300 years.
