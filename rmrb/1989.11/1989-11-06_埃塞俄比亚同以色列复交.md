Ethiopia's foreign ministry spokesman announced on the 3rd that Ethiopia has decided to restore diplomatic relations with Israel. The spokesman said that the decision to resume diplomatic ties with Israel will enable the Ethiopian government to exert influence on the Israeli government and other countries in promoting peace and stability in the Middle East.

Ethiopia severed ties with Israel in October 1973, following the Middle East War, in response to the call by the Organization of African Unity to jointly oppose Israel.

    埃塞俄比亚同以色列复交
    埃塞俄比亚外交部发言人三日宣布，埃塞俄比亚决定恢复同以色列的外交关系。这位发言人说，埃以复交的决定可以使埃塞俄比亚政府在促进中东地区和平和稳定问题上，对以色列和其它国家政府施加影响。
    埃塞俄比亚是在一九七三年十月中东战争后，响应非统组织联合反对以色列的号召，而同以断交的。
