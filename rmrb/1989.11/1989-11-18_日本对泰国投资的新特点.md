After 1986, Japanese enterprises' direct investment in Thailand surged dramatically. In the fiscal year 1985, Japanese direct investment in Thailand was only $48 million, but by 1988, it had increased to $859 million. This year, Japanese enterprises' enthusiasm for investing in Thailand has continued to grow.

A recent survey by the Japanese Economic News Agency indicates that Japanese enterprises consider Thailand the top investment destination in Asia.

Generally, the rapid increase in Japanese direct investment in Thailand is due to the significant appreciation of the yen since 1985 and the rapid improvement of Thailand's investment environment.

Since the 1980s, Thailand's political situation has been relatively stable, and it has adopted an active policy of attracting foreign investment. Additionally, the quality of the labor force is relatively high, making it attractive to foreign investors. Before 1987, Japanese investment in the "Four Asian Tigers" was relatively active. However, due to issues such as currency appreciation, significant increases in wage levels, and escalating trade friction with the United States, Japanese enterprises have shifted their focus to Thailand.

Recently, Japanese direct investment in Thailand has shown several new features. First, export-oriented investments have increased. In the 1960s, Japan's investments in Thailand were mostly import-substituting enterprises, with products primarily sold domestically. However, in the fiscal year 1988, 85% of Japanese enterprise investment projects approved by the Thai Board of Investment had product export ratios exceeding 70%.

Second, Japanese enterprises' investment areas are not limited to consumer goods but extend to various industrial sectors. In particular, there has been an increase in projects producing production materials, semi-finished products, and components. From the projects approved by the Thai Board of Investment, in 1988, investments in fibers, rubber, and wood products (consumer goods) totaled 26, while investments in chemicals and metals were 41, and investments in machinery were 129. This shows that investments in the production materials sector have far exceeded those in the consumer goods sector.

Third, there has been an increase in small-scale investment projects. In 1987, half of the approved Japanese investment projects had fewer than 100 employees, and this trend further expanded in 1988.

Fourth, there has been an increase in wholly Japanese-owned or majority-funded projects. For example, in 1987 and 1988, the average Japanese investment ratio was 66.4%, while at the end of 1980, it was only 40.2%.

The new features of Japanese direct investment in Thailand have also brought about some new problems.

Due to investments by Japanese and other enterprises, the price of industrial zones near Bangkok has risen 2-3 times, and the rent for housing and offices has also surged. Due to a severe shortage of technical personnel, skilled workers, and experts, there is intense competition for talent. Additionally, the large-scale entry of Japanese enterprises has exacerbated the strain on infrastructure.

To address these issues, the Thai government is taking a series of measures, such as strengthening infrastructure construction, shifting foreign investment incentives to areas outside Bangkok, and solving the shortage of mid-level management personnel and engineering technicians through further expansion of universities and corporate training.

    日本对泰国投资的新特点
    刘迪
    1986年以后，日本企业对泰国的直接投资急剧增加。1985年度，日对泰直接投资仅为0.48亿美元，1988年度增至8.59亿美元。今年以来，日本企业对泰投资热情有增无减。
    最近日本经济新闻社的一项调查表明，日本企业认为在亚洲泰国是居第一位的投资对象。
    总的说来，日本企业对泰国直接投资的急速增加是由于1985年以来日元大幅度升值，以及泰国的投资环境迅速好转。
    80年代以来，泰国的政局较为稳定，并采取了积极的引进外资政策，加之劳动力的素质较高，对外国投资者来说有一定的吸引力。1987年以前，日本对“亚洲四小”的投资较为积极，但由于“亚洲四小”货币升值、工资水平大幅度提高、与美国的贸易摩擦加剧等问题，日本企业现在把目光转向泰国。
    最近日本企业对泰国的直接投资出现了若干新的特点。首先，出口型投资增加。60年代，日本在泰国的投资大都是进口替代型企业，产品主要在泰国内销售。而1988年度，经泰国投资委员会批准的85％的日本企业投资项目，其产品出口比率超过70％。
    第二，日本企业投资领域不仅限于消费资料，而且广泛涉及工业的各个领域。尤其是生产生产资料、半成品及零部件的项目增多。从泰国投资委员会批准的项目来看，1988年，纤维、橡胶、木材制品等消费资料的投资为26项，而化学、金属方面的投资则为41项，机械方面的投资为129项，由此可见，对生产资料领域的投资已远远超过对消费资料领域的投资。
    第三，小规模的投资项目增多。1987年被批准的日本投资项目有一半职员在100人以下，1988年这一趋势进一步扩大。
    第四，日本独资或资金过半项目增多。以1987、1988年为例，日出资比率平均为66.4％，而1980年末仅为40.2％。
    日本企业对泰直接投资的新特点也产生了一些新的问题。
    由于日本等国企业对泰投资，造成曼谷近郊的工业区地价上涨了2—3倍，同时，也使住房和办公室的租金猛增。由于技术人员、熟练工人和专家极度缺乏，致使人才争夺激烈。此外，日本企业的大规模进入加剧了基础设施的紧张状况。
    为了解决上述问题，泰国政府正采取一系列措施，如加强基础设施的建设；将外资奖励地区转移到曼谷以外；通过进一步扩充大学和企业进修，解决中间管理人员和工程技术人员短缺问题。
