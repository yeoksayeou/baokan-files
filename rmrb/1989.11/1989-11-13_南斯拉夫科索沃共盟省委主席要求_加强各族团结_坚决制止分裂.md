Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, November 11th.

The three-day 15th Conference of the Kosovo Provincial Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia concluded on November 11th. Raif Morina was re-elected as the Chairman of the Kosovo Provincial Committee of the League of Communists. In his closing speech, he called on all members of the League of Communists and people of all ethnic groups in Kosovo to strengthen unity, resolutely stop Albanian nationalist separatist activities, eliminate their counter-revolutionary roots and consequences, prevent the emigration of Serbs and Montenegrins, and maintain stability in Kosovo.

The 15th Conference of the Kosovo Provincial Committee of the League of Communists was held amidst the unstable situation in Kosovo. Since last year, large-scale demonstrations and strikes organized by Albanian separatists have occurred in Kosovo, paralyzing the region's social and economic life. Although the Yugoslav party and government leadership have repeatedly taken measures, the situation has not stabilized. Recently, due to the trial of former Kosovo party leader Azem Vllasi, Albanian demonstrations and strikes have occurred again in some areas of Kosovo. At the same time, Serbs and Montenegrins residing in Kosovo continue to emigrate.

    南斯拉夫科索沃共盟省委主席要求
    加强各族团结　坚决制止分裂
    新华社贝尔格莱德11月11日电　为期3天的南斯拉夫科索沃省共盟第15次代表会议于11日结束。拉·莫里纳再次当选为科索沃共盟省委主席。他在闭幕式上作总结发言时要求科索沃全体共盟党员和各族人民加强团结，坚决制止阿尔巴尼亚民族分裂主义的活动并清除其反革命根源和后果，制止塞尔维亚和黑山族人外迁，保持科索沃的平静和稳定。
    科索沃共盟第15次代表会议是在科索沃局势不稳定的情况下举行的。自去年以来，科索沃连续发生了由阿族分裂主义者煽动和组织的大规模游行示威和罢工罢课，使科索沃的社会经济生活曾一度处于瘫痪。尽管南斯拉夫党政领导一再采取措施，但局势仍没有稳定下来。最近，因审判前科索沃党的主要领导人弗拉西，科索沃一些地区又连续发生了阿族人示威游行和罢工，同时，居住在科索沃的塞尔维亚族和黑山族人仍不断外迁。
