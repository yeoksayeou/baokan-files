Once November arrives, the atmosphere of Christmas in London becomes increasingly festive. The main streets in the commercial district of West London are adorned with Christmas trees, and the window displays are vibrant and eye-catching, creating a scene of dazzling lights.

However, in stark contrast to this joyous scene is the harsh reality of life. As Christmas approaches and winter draws near, it becomes the most difficult time for the homeless. According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, as Christmas approaches, homeless youth in London are participating in a nationwide protest movement called "The Night Watch" outside the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street. This protest, which lasts for 100 hours, aims to draw the government's and society's attention to "their plight."

This nationwide protest, organized by the charitable organization British Shelter, began on November 4 and lasted for a week. On the morning of the 5th, the temperature was very low, and the cold was biting. Near Trafalgar Square, on the south side of Whitehall Street outside Downing Street, there was a prominent sign for "The Night Watch." Next to it, three or four young people were handing out leaflets to passersby. When we stopped in front of the sign, a young woman named Helen Kay, a representative from the Shelter, introduced herself. According to her, homeless youth from 30 cities in Britain would participate in this protest.

According to the latest report from the Shelter, in 1989, 150,000 young people who had just graduated from school became homeless. The BBC reported that among them, "some are depressed and discouraged, some beg on the streets, some turn to crime, and some even attempt suicide." Miss Helen was quite emotional as she said that most homeless youth are unemployed. Many of them "step out of school and fall into a world of poverty," and because they cannot find work or receive necessary training, they inevitably "fall into the predicament of begging for survival." The Shelter's materials even point out that local authorities have reduced the construction of housing, and young people are excluded from the list of home buyers. "Debt is making many young people poor, and the scale of this poverty is unprecedented since the Victorian era."

As for whether the "Night Watch" action outside Downing Street can improve the plight of homeless youth, the outlook is not optimistic. The Shelter's report warns that unless the government reforms housing and social security, the number of homeless youth will continue to rise. Moreover, the direct cause of youth homelessness is unemployment, and unemployment is a persistent problem in Western society. Therefore, solving this serious social problem in the West is as difficult as solving the problem of unemployment.

    唐宁街外的“守夜”人
    张文英
    一进入十一月，伦敦的圣诞节气氛就日渐浓重。西伦敦商业区的一些主要街道布满圣诞树，橱窗布置更是争奇斗艳，一片火树银花。
    但与这种欢乐景象相对应的，却是现实生活的严酷。圣诞将临，严冬逼近，也是无家可归者最难熬的日子。据英国广播公司报道，值此圣诞来临之即，伦敦无家可归青年纷纷参加在唐宁街首相府外举行的为期一百小时的全国性抗议运动——“守夜”，以唤起政府和整个社会对“他们的困境的关注”。
    这个由慈善机构英国收容中心组织的全国性抗议运动，于十一月四日开始，延续一周。五日晨，气温很低，寒气袭人。在特拉法格广场附近，唐宁街外面的白厅街南侧，竖着一块“守夜”的醒目标语牌，旁边有三、四个青年，在向过往行人散发传单。当我们在标语牌前驻足时，一位女青年向我们介绍，她名叫海伦·凯，是收容中心的一位负责人。据她说，英国有三十座城镇的无家可归青年将参加这场抗议运动。
    据收容中心最新发表的报告指出，在一九八九年曾有十五万刚刚迈出校门的青年人成为无家可归者。英国广播公司报道说，他们中，“有的颓废、沮丧，有的沿街行乞，有的沉沦犯罪，有的甚至企图自寻短见”。海伦小姐颇为激动地说，无家可归的青年人大多数是失业者。他们中许多人“刚迈出校门就陷入了一个贫困的世界”，由于找不到工作，得不到必要的培训，免不了“陷进行乞生存的困境”。收容中心提供的资料甚至还指出，地方当局营建的房屋减少，青年人被排除在购房者行列之外，“负债正在使许多青年人贫困，其规模是维多利亚时代以来少见的。”
    至于唐宁街外的“守夜”行动能否改善无家可归青年的困境，前景不容乐观。收容中心的报告警告说，除非政府在住房和社会保险方面进行改革，否则，无家可归的青年还要增加。而且，青年无家可归的直接原因是失业，而失业又与西方社会形影相伴，因此，解决无家可归这一严重的西方社会问题，就如同解决失业问题一样困难。
