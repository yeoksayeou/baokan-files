A major discussion on the topic "The country faces difficulties, what should we do?" is underway among 30,000 Communist Party members and 260,000 workers in Shanghai's light industry system. This discussion is fostering a strong sense of responsibility and ownership among the workers, boosting their confidence in overcoming difficulties.

Shanghai's light industry is a pillar of the city's industrial production. Since the second half of this year, many enterprises have faced severe economic challenges such as tight funds and a sluggish market. In late October, during a meeting on ideological and political work in Shanghai's industrial enterprises, Shanghai Clock and Watch Factory shared their experiences of linking this discussion to their actual situation and conducting it among all employees. The leadership of Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Light Industry highly praised this discussion and called for it to be carried out across the entire system.

This discussion has received a strong response throughout the system. Shanghai Bicycle Factory, for example, is facing a significant reduction in profits due to rising raw material prices. The factory leadership has proposed to do everything possible to strive for the completion of the contract target, making this discussion a concrete action plan for the entire factory.

As the discussion deepens, Shanghai's light industry enterprises are translating the question "The country faces difficulties, what should we do?" into "The enterprise faces difficulties, what should I do?" Shanghai Watch Factory has divided this discussion into three layers, and the entire factory is now filled with a new atmosphere where everyone wants to contribute more to the country and the enterprise.

    上海轻工系统26万职工展开大讨论
    “国家有困难，我们怎么办？”
    主人翁意识增强　有信心克服困难
    据新华社上海11月16日电 （通讯员范伟民）一场“国家有困难，我们怎么办”的大讨论，正在上海轻工业系统3万多名共产党员、26万名职工中深入展开。这场大讨论正激发出广大职工为国家争挑重担的主人翁意识，增强了克服困难的信心。
    上海轻工业是上海工业生产的一大支柱。今年下半年以来，许多企业面临资金紧缺、市场疲软的严峻经济形势。10月下旬，在上海市举行的工业企业思想政治工作会议上，上海钟表公司介绍了他们联系实际，在全体职工中开展“国家有困难，我们怎么办”的讨论情况。上海市轻工业局领导对这一讨论十分赞赏，要求全局系统展开这场有意义的讨论。
    这场讨论在全局引起热烈响应。上海自行车厂由于原材料价格上涨，减利很多，厂领导提出竭尽全力，向完成承包基数的目标努力，具体化了全厂开展“国家有困难，我们怎么办”的讨论。
    随着这场大讨论的深入，上海轻工企业正在把“国家有困难，我们怎么办”这个大题目落实到“企业有困难，我该怎么办”的主题上来。上海手表厂将这次讨论分三层展开，全厂群情振奋，出现了人人要为国家、企业多超产、作贡献的新气象。
