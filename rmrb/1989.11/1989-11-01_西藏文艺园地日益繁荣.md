	The Cultural Landscape of Tibet Continues to Flourish
	Our reporter Liu Wei, Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Hao report from Lhasa: At the recently held "Tibet Literature and Art Ten Years Achievements Exhibition," over five hundred award-winning works were on display, fully showcasing the achievements of artistic creations with Tibetan characteristics. A creative group centered around Tibetan art, encompassing various artistic disciplines, has taken shape.

	In the past ten years of reform and opening up, the literary and artistic circles of Tibet have flourished, with over one hundred and seventy works winning national awards, national minority awards, and literary awards from five provinces and regions.

	Tibet's art community has held several art exhibitions in inland China in recent years, demonstrating their strength. After Han Shuli's comic strip "Banjin Meiduo" won the gold medal at the Sixth National Art Exhibition, it also toured England, the United States, France, Italy, and other countries, and won the collective special honor award at the first World Comic Strip Festival. Following the stage design "Qingjinma" winning the honor award at the 1986 Prague International Stage Design Exhibition, "Baimawenba" participated in the 1989 Shanghai International Stage Design Invitational Exhibition. The National Art Museum of China, the Museum of Nationalities, the Mao Zedong Memorial Hall, and other art museums have collected more than twenty masterpieces from Tibetan artists. Tibet has held four large-scale calligraphy exhibitions, and in August of this year, it also held the first Tibetan calligraphy exhibition. Over the past ten years, Tibetan photographers have shot and edited more than twenty albums reflecting the customs and real life of Tibet, and have published more than twenty thousand photographic works at home and abroad. Tibetan photographer Wangju Duoji's "The Spring of the Temple" won the gold medal at an international photo exhibition.

	In 1986, Tibet resumed the annual Shoton Festival, and the essence of traditional Tibetan opera has been inherited and developed.

    西藏美术界连续几年在内地举办美展，显示了实力。韩书力的连环画《邦锦美朵》获第六届全国美展金牌后，又在英、美、法、意等国巡回展，并获世界首届连环画节集体特别荣誉奖。继舞美设计《央金玛》获一九八六年布拉格国际舞美展荣誉奖后，《白马文巴》又参加了一九八九年上海国际舞美邀请展。中国美术馆、民族文化宫、毛主席纪念堂及其他艺术博物馆，收藏了西藏各族画家二十余幅佳作。西藏先后举办了四次大型书法展，今年八月还举办了首届藏文书法展。西藏各族摄影家十年来拍摄、编辑了二十多册反映西藏风情和现实生活的画册，在国内外发表摄影作品二万余件。藏族摄影师旺久多吉的《寺庙的春天》，在国际影展上夺得金牌。
    一九八六年西藏恢复了一年一度的雪顿节，传统藏戏精华得到继承发展。
