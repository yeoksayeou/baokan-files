The State Council Office recently convened a meeting to formulate six measures to prevent a significant decline in the shrimp aquaculture industry. The meeting required that the people's governments of coastal provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as relevant national departments, implement these measures.

The meeting noted that after a decade of effort, China has become one of the world's leading countries in shrimp aquaculture, achieving an annual production capacity of 200,000 tons. Shrimp is a key export product for China, providing employment for millions of people, helping some regions to reduce poverty and become prosperous, and serving as an important economic pillar in certain areas. However, due to the current heavy tax and fee burdens, rising prices of production materials, and fluctuations in international market demand, the entire shrimp aquaculture industry is facing a serious risk of significant decline. To address this, relevant departments have agreed to take effective measures immediately to protect China's shrimp aquaculture industry. The meeting decided on the following:

1. The agricultural and forestry special product tax levied by the state should be maintained. However, to protect the enthusiasm of shrimp farmers, local authorities should calculate taxes reasonably, taking into account the actual costs of shrimp farming. Local financial departments should formulate tax collection standards based on actual conditions.

2. To effectively reduce the burden on shrimp farmers, local authorities should thoroughly clean up various fees collected from the shrimp farming industry. Unreasonable fees and arbitrary levies should be abolished.

3. To protect the interests of shrimp farmers, the State Price Bureau, in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, should propose a downward adjustment of the purchase price for shrimp. The national average should be set at approximately 16 yuan per kilogram, with local authorities determining their own reasonable purchase prices based on this.

4. Efforts should be made to solve the problem of shrimp purchase funds, with specialized banks providing support.

5. Active efforts should be made to promote the export of shrimp.

6. The development of shrimp aquaculture production should be oriented towards both the international and domestic markets. Currently, shrimp prices are relatively high, but with the improvement of living standards in China, especially during festivals in urban areas, there is still considerable potential. Local aquatic product supply and marketing companies should actively organize domestic sales, reduce intermediate links, lower costs, and achieve thin-profit, high-volume sales to maintain existing aquaculture bases and export earnings.

    国办召集会议定措施保护我国对虾养殖业
    据新华社北京11月1日电  （通讯员关锐捷）国务院办公厅最近召集会议，制订出6条防止养殖对虾大滑坡的措施，要求沿海省、市、自治区人民政府和国家有关部门贯彻执行。
    会议认为，经过10年努力，我国已成为世界上对虾养殖大国，形成年产20万吨的规模，是我国出口创汇的重点产品。这一产业的兴起，不仅吸收了百万人就业，使一些地区脱贫致富，而且在有的地区已成为重要的经济支柱。但由于当前税费负担过重，生产资料价格上涨，国际市场需求波动，整个对虾养殖业面临大滑坡的严重局面。对此，有关部门一致同意立即采取有效措施，保护我国的对虾养殖业，会议决定：
    一、国家开征的农林特产税要维护，但为保护虾农生产积极性，各地在征税时计算要合理，要照顾养虾的实际成本，由当地财政部门根据实际情况制定征收标准。
    二、为切实减轻虾农负担，各地要认真清理养虾业所收取的各种费用，对不合理的乱收费、乱摊派要一律取消。
    三、为保护虾农利益，请国家物价局会同农业部和经贸部提出对虾收购下浮价格，全国定为每公斤16元左右，各地可据此确定各自合理的收购价格。
    四、切实帮助解决对虾收购资金，请各专业银行共同加以支持。
    五、积极组织对虾出口。
    六、发展对虾养殖生产要面向国际、国内两个市场。目前，对虾价格较高，但随着国内人民生活水平的提高，尤其在城市节日供应中还是有一定潜力的。各级水产供销公司要积极组织国内销售，要减少中间环节、降低费用，做到薄利多销，保住现有的养殖基地，保住现有的创汇水平。
