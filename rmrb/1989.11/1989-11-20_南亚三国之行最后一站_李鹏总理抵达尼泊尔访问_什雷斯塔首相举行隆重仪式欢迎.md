The friendship between China and Nepal, cultivated by the late King Mahendra, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Premier Zhou Enlai, has developed satisfactorily. The relationship between China and Nepal, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, is a model for international relations today. The purpose of my visit to your country is to carry on the friendly cause initiated by our predecessors and to further enhance the friendship and cooperation between our two countries. I look forward to exchanging views with King Birendra and Prime Minister Shreshta on bilateral relations and international issues of common concern. I am confident that through this visit, the close friendly relations that already exist between our two countries will be further consolidated and developed."
