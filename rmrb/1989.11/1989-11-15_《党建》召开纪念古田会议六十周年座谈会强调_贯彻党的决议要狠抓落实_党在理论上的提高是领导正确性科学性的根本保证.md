	Party Building Magazine Holds Symposium to Mark the 60th Anniversary of the Gutian Conference, Emphasizing the Implementation of Party Resolutions and the Importance of Theoretical Advancement

	The Party Building magazine, published by the Central Propaganda Department, recently held a symposium to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Gutian Conference. A group of veteran comrades and cadres from higher education institutions, government agencies, and enterprises discussed how to inherit and carry forward the spirit of the Gutian Conference resolution in the new historical period and further strengthen party building.

	In December 1929, the Red Fourth Army held its ninth party congress in Gutian Village, Shanghang County, Fujian Province. This conference was convened to summarize the experiences of party and military building since the Nanchang Uprising. The conference adopted the resolution "On Rectifying Erroneous Thoughts within the Party," drafted by Mao Zedong, which emphasized the need to build the party from a theoretical standpoint, strengthen Marxist-Leninist education within the party, carry out criticism and self-criticism, overcome negative tendencies, and strictly adhere to democratic centralism in organizational matters. The resolution also stressed the party's absolute leadership over the Red Army, stipulating that the Red Army's tasks, in addition to combat, included political and ideological work and the proper handling of military-civilian and officer-soldier relations. The conference established the correct line for military building, transforming the Red Army into a people's army based on Marxism-Leninism.

	Xiao Ke, a participant in the Gutian Conference and a member of the Central Advisory Commission, recalled the proceedings of the Gutian Conference, stating that the Gutian Conference resolution played a significant role in the development, consolidation, and strengthening of our party and army. The influence of the Gutian Conference resolution is profound and has been proven by history. He proposed that the implementation of party resolutions must be vigorously pursued. He said that for an organization and its cadres, consistency between theory and practice, and between words and deeds, is of paramount importance. Good resolutions and correct theories are meaningless if they remain only in writing or in words and are not seriously implemented. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have made many good resolutions, and recently, many resolutions and directives have been issued. Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech on National Day also proposed important tasks. If we vigorously implement and resolutely carry out these documents and reports, our cause will be much easier to accomplish.

	Xiao Ke said that to seriously implement party resolutions, we must overcome many obstacles and difficulties, especially in areas such as combating corruption, rectifying and reorganizing companies, and preventing leading cadres from using their power for personal gain. These issues are complex, and the resistance may be even greater. Therefore, we must make a great effort, with great determination, and resolutely and unyieldingly carry out these tasks to truly achieve good results and gain the support of the people.

	Chen Pisha, a member of the Central Advisory Commission, proposed in his speech that to carry forward the spirit of the Gutian Conference resolution, we must rectify various erroneous ideological tendencies within the party, especially to clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization. He said that the Party Central Committee is now calling for serious study and research of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, especially the study and research of Marxist philosophy, among party members, particularly high-level cadres, to master a scientific worldview and methodology. The Gutian Conference resolution clearly stipulates this requirement, stating, "Educate party members to use Marxist-Leninist methods to analyze political situations and estimate class forces, replacing subjective analysis and estimation." The party's theoretical advancement is the fundamental guarantee of the correctness and scientific nature of the party's leadership.

	Chen Pisha said that to strengthen party ideological building, we must also carry out active ideological struggles within the party, including party criticism and self-criticism. The Gutian Conference resolution points out that "party criticism is a weapon to strengthen the party's organization and increase the party's combat effectiveness." In recent years, bourgeois liberalization has run rampant, and various erroneous ideas have spread within the party without being corrected, dispersing party cohesion and public morale. One important reason for this is the lack of ideological struggle within the party and the failure to wield the sharp weapon of party criticism and self-criticism. This is a bitter lesson in party ideological building.

	Zeng Zhi, a member of the Central Advisory Commission, suggested in his speech that in the party's theoretical study, we should advocate using the spirit and content of the Gutian Conference resolution to review and summarize our ideological and political work. Like the Gutian Conference resolution, we should use Marxist principles, viewpoints, and methods to analyze the sources, manifestations, and solutions of various erroneous ideas within the party, starting from specific realities, linking theory with practice, seeking truth from facts, and dialectically analyzing the erroneous ideas that currently exist within the party. By summarizing experiences and learning from lessons, we can promote the continuous advancement of reform and opening up and socialist modernization construction in various aspects of work.

	Li Lian, Secretary-General of the Central Advisory Commission, Chen Xiaoda, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Beijing Railway Bureau, Li Wenhai, Secretary of the Party Committee of Renmin University of China, Bian Junzheng, Deputy Director of the Industrial Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee, Qiu Guilin, Deputy Director of the Party History and Political Work Teaching and Research Office of the National Defense University, and Li Jun, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Beijing Internal Combustion Engine Factory, also spoke at the symposium.

    《党建》召开纪念古田会议六十周年座谈会强调
    贯彻党的决议要狠抓落实
    党在理论上的提高是领导正确性科学性的根本保证
    新华社北京11月14日电　中宣部《党建》杂志社日前召开纪念古田会议60周年座谈会，一批老同志和高等院校、机关、企业的干部，在会上就新的历史时期如何继承和发扬古田会议决议的精神，进一步加强党的建设问题进行了座谈。
    1929年12月，红四军在福建上杭县古田村举行党的第九次代表大会。
    这次会议是为总结南昌起义以来建党建军的经验而召开的。会议通过了毛泽东起草的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》的决议，指出应该首先从思想上建党，加强党内的马克思列宁主义教育，开展批评与自我批评，克服不良倾向，组织上必须坚持严格的民主集中制。决议还强调党对红军的绝对领导，规定红军的任务除了打仗之外，还要做政治思想工作和正确处理军民和官兵关系等。会议规定了正确的建军路线，使红军成为建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的人民军队。
    古田会议的参加者、中顾委常委肖克在回顾古田会议的经过时说，古田会议决议对我党我军的发展、巩固和壮大，起着重大的作用。古田会议决议影响深远，已为历史所证明。他提出，贯彻党的决议要狠抓落实。他说，一个组织、一个干部理论与实践一致、言行一致是十分重要的。好的决议，正确的理论，如果只停留在文字上、口头上，不认真执行，就毫无意义。党的十一届三中全会以来，党中央、国务院作出了很多好的决议，最近又发布了好多决议、指示，江泽民同志国庆讲话也提出了很重要的任务。这些文件、报告，我们如果狠抓落实，坚决执行，我们的事业就好办了。
    肖克说，对于党的决议要认真贯彻，就要克服许多阻力和障碍，尤其是像反官倒、清理整顿公司和克服领导干部以权谋私等问题，难度很大，阻力可能会更大。这就要求我们要下大决心，花大气力，毫不动摇、毫不手软地抓下去，才能真正取得好成效，得到人民的拥护。
    中顾委常委陈丕显在讲话中提出，发扬古田会议决议精神，必须纠正党内各种错误思想倾向，特别是要旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化。他说，党中央现在号召，在党内首先是党的高级干部中，认真学习和研究马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的基本理论，特别是学习研究马克思主义哲学，掌握科学的世界观、方法论。关于这一点，古田会议决议中就有明确的要求，古田会议决议提出“教育党员用马克思列宁主义的方法去作政治形势的分析和阶级势力的估量，以代替主观主义的分析和估量”。党在理论上的提高，是党的领导的正确性、科学性的根本保证。
    陈丕显说，加强党的思想建设，还要开展党内积极的思想斗争，包括党内的批评与自我批评。古田会议决议中指出“党内批评是坚强党的组织、增加党的战斗力的武器”。这几年资产阶级自由化泛滥成灾，各种错误思想在党内发展蔓延而得不到纠正，把党心搞散了，把人心也搞散了。其中一个重要原因，就是没有开展党内的思想斗争，没有拿起党内批评与自我批评这个锐利武器，这是党的思想建设上的一大惨痛教训。
    中顾委委员曾志在发言中建议，在全党的理论学习中，提倡以古田会议决议精神和内容，回顾总结我们的思想政治工作，像古田会议决议那样，对每个问题都用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法，从具体实际出发，理论联系实际，实事求是，唯物辩证地分析目前党内存在的一些错误思想的来源、表现以及研究解决的办法。总结经验，接受教训，促进改革开放和社会主义现代化建设等各项工作不断前进。
    中顾委秘书长李力安、北京铁路局党委书记陈效达、中国人民大学党委书记李文海、北京市委工业部副部长卞君正、国防大学党史政工教研室副主任邱桂林、北京内燃机总厂党委书记李军等，也在座谈会上发了言。
