The "King of Indigowoad Root"

In the early spring of 1988, Shanghai experienced a severe outbreak of hepatitis A, with a cumulative number of 290,000 cases. The city was in a state of tension as people rushed to buy Indigowoad Root syrup. The Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Factory in Yangzhou received urgent requests for the syrup. The epidemic was severe and time was of the essence!

The Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Factory was originally a small pharmaceutical plant in Kouqiao Town, Taixing County, Jiangsu Province. Since 1978, it had produced Indigowoad Root syrup, known for its good quality and high efficacy, which was beloved by the masses. At that time, there were not many factories nationwide producing Indigowoad Root. In 1981, during the floods in Sichuan, large quantities of Indigowoad Root syrup were dispatched from here, earning the title of "King of Indigowoad Root."

In early 1988, the Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Factory had a production line for Indigowoad Root syrup with a monthly output of over 50,000 packs (each pack containing 10 doses). However, the amount of Indigowoad Root syrup needed to combat hepatitis A in Shanghai was not in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands, but nearly four million packs! Completing such a massive task was a formidable challenge, with shortages in raw materials, manpower, factory space, and equipment. The difficulty was unimaginable to outsiders.

Xu Jingren, the factory director of Yangtze River Pharmaceutical, had joined the army and the party after graduating from high school. Five years in the military had forged his resolute character. He was tall and broad-shouldered, with thick eyebrows and large eyes, and was in his forties. He was quick-witted, daring to innovate, and had a booming voice, giving him a commanding presence. Driven by a sense of sacred social responsibility, he and several other factory leaders decided to accept the entire order from Shanghai, no matter how difficult, arduous, or tiring it might be!

They quickly assembled skilled workers and technicians from across the factory to restart the Indigowoad Root production line. Simultaneously, they dispatched teams to Henan Zhoukou Town and Nantong City to bring back sieving machines and boilers, installing them in the new workshop within just four or five days. It was a lightning-fast operation!

It was the New Year, and Kouqiao Town was decorated with lanterns and firecrackers. Families were gathering to celebrate the holiday. However, from the director to the workers at Yangtze River Pharmaceutical, no one went home for the festival. Instead, they worked day and night to produce the syrup, successfully manufacturing 3.85 million packs of Indigowoad Root syrup by the end of April 1988 and delivering them to the people of Shanghai. Although Indigowoad Root is not necessarily effective in treating hepatitis A, it has some preventive effects against the virus. During the emergency, people still rushed to buy it, making it a scarce commodity. However, Xu Jingren did not take advantage of the situation to raise prices. Instead, he adhered to the regulated price, not increasing it by a single cent. The Shanghai medical and pharmaceutical sales units repeatedly sent letters expressing their gratitude for the factory's dedication.

A Persistent and Beautiful Dream

Since its establishment, the Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Factory had never asked the state for a single cent. In 1980, its output value was 644,000 yuan, and by 1988, it had surpassed 100 million yuan. The output value and profits had increased eightfold consecutively for eight years, with each employee contributing over 100,000 yuan in profits. It was not only a leading industrial enterprise in Taixing County and Yangzhou City but also ranked among the top in the province's 167 pharmaceutical factories.

As Xu Jingren put it, "This success is the result of the blood, sweat, and tears of all employees!"

In January 1971, the Kouqiao Instrument Factory established a pharmaceutical workshop, which was the predecessor of the Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Factory. Could this be considered a pharmaceutical workshop? It had only six rooms, two large water tanks, and a dozen trained workers. The production of two types of injections, Beraprost and Beraprostil, required a lot of water, but they didn't even have a water tower. Xu Jingren and the workers would take turns fetching water from a river half a mile away. Each day, 20 tanks of water were needed, and each tank required 20 loads of water. Two people fetching water would take eight to nine hours!

The factory was too small to operate efficiently. Xu Jingren found a piece of wasteland and led everyone to dig soil, level graves, fill ponds, carry bricks, and build factory buildings. Short of funds, he had to borrow money from various sources. To save on travel expenses, employees would rent a bicycle for 70 cents to go to the county for business, choosing one with a rack to carry an extra person. Upon returning, they would immediately change out of their sweaty clothes and get back to work in the workshop.

In early September 1971, after successfully producing the two types of injections, the workers, with tears in their eyes, couldn't help but shout, "Our first shot has been fired!"

That year's sales volume was not large, but it was a difficult first step. The pharmaceutical workshop was approved by the town government to become the Workers and Farmers Pharmaceutical Factory. At that time, the lowest salary for workers was 9 yuan, and the factory director Xu Jingren only earned 23.5 yuan. Everyone worked overtime without complaining, and no one asked for overtime pay. Everyone found their unique value in hard work and creation, discovering that they could now use their own hands to heal the nation's people. They were full of aspirations and hopes for the future, a persistent and beautiful dream!

Disaster Strikes

In April 1985, to prepare for the implementation of the "National Drug Administration Law" and the issuance of the "Three Certificates" (production, business, and hygiene permits), the factory established a rectification leadership group and office led by Director Xu. They conducted strict rectifications in nine areas: production, operations, quality, hygiene, personnel, and factory buildings. In June, after inspections by the provincial, municipal, and county-level "Three Certificates" inspection teams, everything was confirmed to be in order, and people seemed to be able to breathe a sigh of relief.

But disaster struck!

Shortly after the inspection team left, several domestic newspapers published a news item about their factory: "Taixing County Pharmaceutical Factory Kouqiao Branch sold substandard drugs in large quantities to Shanghai!" Some medical and pharmaceutical newspapers and magazines also reprinted the news. People were still frightened by the recent Jinjiang fake drug incident, and now another substandard drug incident in Kouqiao!

The Kouqiao Pharmaceutical Branch was immediately shrouded in a terrifying shadow. Return orders and return contracts poured in. All shipped goods were sealed, funds could not be recovered, and the entire factory was forced to stop production for three months, resulting in economic losses of 7 million yuan.

The Kouqiao Pharmaceutical Branch faced a severe test!

Xu Jingren was worried sick! He felt as if someone had suddenly hit him with a heavy blow. He couldn't understand how such a preposterous and defamatory thing could happen? Ah, he gradually realized that this fabricated and false "news" was based on an unverified "letter from the people" received by a certain administrative department and the fabricated words of a certain city's pharmaceutical distribution unit in the context of competition, aiming to eliminate out-of-town drugs. He sought help from various channels, requesting that higher-level leaders investigate the facts to clarify the truth!

In August, the joint investigation team from the Taixing County, Yangzhou City, and Jiangsu Province drug administration departments entered the factory. Soon after, the National Drug Administration and the provincial, municipal, and county-level drug distribution departments also sent people. They reviewed the factory's invoices, records, and production logs from the past two years and sampled 250 batches of finished products, confirming that all products from the Kouqiao Pharmaceutical Factory were of qualified quality.

This "letter from the people" caused a new enterprise to suffer a loss of 7 million yuan and wasted the precious time of more than 20 cadres for half a month, but the falsehood was eventually cleared up.

Xu Jingren and the factory leaders did not relax. While focusing on restoring the factory's vitality, they learned from the "substandard drug" incident, conducted in-depth education on product quality awareness among employees, formulated internal control standards exceeding national regulations for drug quality, and strengthened product quality management and inspection. Ironically, the Indigowoad Root syrup, which was once accused of being "substandard," won first place in the provincial evaluation of similar products in October.

In November, the Yangzhou Municipal Commission approved the renaming of the Taixing Pharmaceutical Factory Kouqiao Branch to "Yangzhou Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Factory." From then on, the flag of the Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Factory flew high on the banks of the Yangtze River.

The Symphony of New Life

On an autumn night in 1988, Director Xu's office was illuminated by an unending light. He smoked incessantly, lost in thought. The smoke turned into a mist, slowly rising in the room.

During the "Double Increase, Double Decrease" campaign, the state tightened credit, curbing economic overheating. Facing a sluggish market, external debts, and rising raw material prices, "Yangtze River" encountered unprecedented difficulties. As the director and party secretary, Xu Jingren had the final say on all major issues within the factory. Now, he hesitated over his proposed reform plan. Could the plan to increase production and double profits be implemented without reduction? He called in the other four factory-level cadres, his most reliable comrades. They discussed, debated, and explored until dawn.

The deepened reform plan was finally determined. With astonishing courage and determination, they made many wise and bold decisions.

There are always best-selling, average-selling, and slow-selling products in the market, and Yangtze River Pharmaceutical was no exception. Let product quality lead the way! We will rely on our award-winning high-quality and branded products to enter the market in large quantities; at the same time, according to market needs, continuously develop new products.

Xu Jingren personally took charge of the sales work, transforming the enterprise from a production-oriented to a management-oriented one. Originally, the entire factory had only 13 salespeople. He assembled elite forces from across the factory, gradually expanding the team to 30-50 people, establishing a nationwide sales network excluding Tibet. He adhered to the principle of "customer first, emphasize credibility, convenient service, and ensure quality," enduring hardships and delivering goods to customers' doors.

He also carried out in-depth reforms within the enterprise: reducing the number of office staff from over 100 to around 60; promoting young, capable, and respected individuals to production leadership positions; implementing optimal labor combinations and piecework wage systems in workshops, allowing each employee to contribute according to their abilities and receive more for more work.

To maintain the enterprise's momentum and enhance the competitiveness of its products, the Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Group Company was established, forming a solid cooperative relationship with multiple medical research institutions and chemical, plastic factories in Beijing and Nanjing.

Previously, the annual capital investment for factory construction was around 3-4 million yuan. Now, except for minor construction projects, all construction projects were halted.

With appropriate economic measures, there must be party political work to ensure them. The party, youth league, and trade union organizations here frequently educate employees on the enterprise spirit of "perseverance, innovation, teamwork, and never being satisfied," as well as patriotism and law-abiding education. Each party member and cadre is responsible for a certain number of workers, assisting workshops in ideological work. Over the past decade, there has been no worker in the factory who has violated laws and disciplines.

Through hardships and difficulties, the factory's output value surpassed the 100 million yuan mark last year, with profits of 13.32 million yuan. This year, the first half of the year completed an output value of 50 million yuan and recovered 40 million yuan in funds. The people of Yangtze River Pharmaceutical faced difficulties head-on, composing a symphony of the enterprise's new life.

Upright and Honorable

In April 1986, six officials from the National Drug Administration came to the Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Factory to inspect drug quality. One night at 2:00 AM, they strolled through several workshops. They were surprised and convinced, later saying, "Every worker in the workshop is focused on their work, and the production order is excellent. No one is dozing off or chatting. We've visited many pharmaceutical factories nationwide, and such a factory is rare!"

Guo Youming was a demobilized soldier who drove trucks. After coming to Yangtze River Pharmaceutical to drive, he worked diligently and later became the truck team leader. Once, while driving a "130" truck to Nanjing to deliver pharmaceuticals, a "Jianghuai" truck suddenly swerved from the slow lane to the fast lane. If the "130" had braked hard to the right, it would have collided with the traffic control booth on the road, killing the co-driver Xiao Wu. This could not be done! He immediately turned the truck sharply to the left and braked hard. The tail of the "Jianghuai" hit the "130," and his liver was crushed. Xiao Wu wanted to take him to the hospital, but he endured the excruciating pain and said in a trembling voice, "Xiao Wu, I can't make it... Don't worry about me... The truck has the factory's goods, quickly call the director to report!" Xiao Wu, tears streaming down his face, took the team leader to the hospital, but he died on the operating table.

The unfortunate news spread throughout the factory, and Director Xu couldn't help but shed tears, with many comrades crying in sorrow. The party branch posthumously recognized Guo Youming as an outstanding party member, and the entire factory launched a campaign to learn from Guo Youming. Guo Youming will forever be remembered in the hearts of all employees as a selfless and virtuous person!

There are countless such people who silently work for the factory. An invisible and powerful cohesive force tightly binds everyone's aspirations together.

I visited many factory veterans, young workers, and office staff, and they unanimously told me, "Our factory's cadres are good, and we trust them!" Since Director Xu came to the factory, he has lived and eaten in the factory, except for meals and sleeping for five or six hours at night, all his time is spent working. Other cadres follow his example, often working late into the night. They truly worry about the survival and development of the enterprise. Their hearts are filled with all the employees of the factory. Under Xu's proposal and enthusiastic support, a dormitory building for employees was built, solving the "two places, one family" problem for many technical personnel. Each worker can enjoy a 50-cent nutritional subsidy for lunch, and more than ten diligent young people were sent to study at the College of Pharmacy or other universities.

People say: The atmosphere at Yangtze River Pharmaceutical is upright!

Xu Jingren is a native of Kouqiao Town, and he has many relatives and friends there. As the Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Factory thrived, more people sought his help to arrange jobs for their children in the factory. Xu Jingren said, "I can't give you an answer now. When the factory recruits employees, you can come to the factory to register and take the exam." Those who met the criteria were hired, and those who did not were not accepted. Thus, the cultural, moral, and physical qualities of all employees in the factory are relatively good. Those who were not hired naturally blamed Xu Jingren for being "heartless." Over time, even those who blamed him knew that this was the recruitment system of Yangtze River Pharmaceutical, which even Director Xu himself could not violate.

In the display window of the North Factory of Yangtze River Pharmaceutical, there is a large calligraphy by Xu Jingren: "Integrity." This is his personal code of conduct, and he also requires the same from the employees: everyone should cherish the factory's property and not allow any misuse of public funds for private gain. He also stipulated that cadres should not accept gifts or disguised "kickbacks," and salespeople should not entertain or give gifts. Pharmaceuticals should be promoted through product quality, normal channels (second-level wholesale stations in various local pharmaceutical companies), and their own credit, friendship, and thoughtful service. Over the years, there have been many instances of refusing bribes and gratuities, with no cases of embezzlement or bribery. In today's society, where unethical practices are rampant, it is rare to see people conduct themselves with such integrity, making it a shining point in the spiritual world of Yangtze River Pharmaceutical. "If one is not upright, how can one expect others to be upright?" If Xu Jingren does not strictly discipline himself, he has no right to demand the same from others.

As the saying goes, "The taller the tree, the stronger the wind." As the Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Factory grew larger, Xu Jingren became famous in the pharmaceutical industry, and with some achievements, he inevitably faced some misunderstandings, criticisms, and jealousy from a few individuals. The most common saying is: Xu Jingren is arrogant. In fact, he listens carefully to the opinions and suggestions of ordinary workers and has taken cadres to learn from advanced enterprises in Su Nan and the county multiple times. He said, "The pressure of running a factory is immense, and market competition is fierce. Even if one wants to be arrogant, it's difficult!" It's just that many people visit the factory, and his work is too busy, so there are times when he can't attend to everyone.

One day, Xu Jingren's old classmate, Xi Hongsheng, asked him, "Old Xu, what are you after? Why do you have to make yourself so miserable?" Xu Jingren narrowed his eyes, smiled, and said, "What am I after? To run such a large factory, it's not enough for me to do! Losing a bit personally, risking my life, what's the big deal?" A friend of Xu Jingren once wrote two lines of poetry for him: "Without the trials of heaven, one is not an iron man; without the envy of others, one is a mediocre person." Xu Jingren thought for a moment and said, "I don't want to be a mediocre person. I just want to be an upright and accomplished person, a person with a clear conscience!"

Yu Biao, the deputy director of the Yangzhou Pharmaceutical Company, heard that I was going to write an article about Yangtze River Pharmaceutical and actively came to talk to me for half a day. He said, "I have seen Yangtze River Pharmaceutical grow. Like Yangtze River Pharmaceutical, such a good enterprise, and like Xu Jingren, such an entrepreneurial enterprise leader, are not many in our region. If 1/3 of the enterprises nationwide can do this, our modernization drive will be very impressive!"

In Yangzhou City, there is a famous historical site, the Temple of Wen Qingshi. The heroic deeds of Wen Tianxiang in resisting the Yuan dynasty in Yangzhou, and his "Song of Righteousness" written in prison, full of patriotic passion, have always inspired people to persevere in the face of difficulties and bravely create a new life. "When righteousness is abundant, it is fierce and eternal. When it pierces the sun and moon, life and death are of no consequence!" The people of Yangtze River Pharmaceutical are not afraid of setbacks, adversity, or danger. From a small workshop with only a few rooms and two water tanks, they have built a socialist advanced enterprise with over a thousand employees, composing a song of righteousness for our times.

Salute to the hardworking people of Yangtze River Pharmaceutical!

    扬子江的正气歌
    陈模
   “板蓝根大王”
    1988年的初春，上海市爆发了严重的甲型肝炎，累计发病者达29万多人，市内市郊不少人在抢购板蓝根干糖浆，全市笼罩在一片紧张的气氛之中……
    要求调拨板蓝根干糖浆的电文像雪片似的飞到扬州市扬子江制药厂，疫情紧急，刻不容缓！
    扬子江制药厂过去是江苏省泰兴县口岸镇一个制药小厂，从1978年就创制了板蓝根干糖浆，由于质量好、疗效高，深受广大群众的喜爱。当时，全国生产板蓝根的药厂并不多。1981年四川发生水灾时，从这里调拨了大批的板蓝根干糖浆，获得了“板蓝根大王”的雅号。
    1988年初，扬子江有一个生产板蓝根干糖浆的车间，月产量有五万多包（每包十袋）。上海防治甲型肝炎所需要的板蓝根干糖浆，不是几万、几十万包，而是近四百万包！要完成这样艰巨的任务，原料、人手、厂房、设备均不够，其难度之大，不是局外人能想象得到的。
    扬子江制药厂的厂长徐镜人，高中毕业以后参军入了党。五年部队的炉火，锤炼了他一副刚毅的性格。他的身材魁梧，浓眉大眼，四十来岁。他思维敏捷，敢于开拓，加上那一副洪亮的嗓门，颇有一点大将的风度。出于一种神圣的社会责任感，他和几个厂干部研究，决定接受上海市的全部定货任务，再难再苦再累也要干！
      他们一面从全厂调集熟练的工人、技师，恢复已停产的板蓝根车间，一面连夜派人到河南周口镇及南通市把筛选机、锅炉拉回来，在短短的四五天内，安装在新车间。真是闪电的速度！
      正值新春佳节，口岸镇街上张灯结彩，四处响起了噼噼啪啪的鞭炮声，家家户户都在团聚过年。扬子江厂从厂长到工人，想到上海的疫情扩大了，谁也不回家过节，日夜兼程地投入了紧张的制药劳动，终于在1988年1至4月间，生产出385万多包板蓝根干糖浆，及时地送到上海人民手中。尽管板蓝根对治疗甲型肝炎不一定有特殊疗效，但在当时紧急情况下，由于它对病毒有一定防治作用，人们还是争相购买，以至使板蓝根成为紧俏药品。可是，徐镜人并没有趁机哄抬药价，而是按照规定的价格，每包没有涨一厘钱，上海市的医药销售单位，多次来信感谢扬子江厂的奉献精神。
    一个执著的美好的梦
      扬子江制药厂从建厂以来，没有伸手向国家要过一分钱。1980年的产值是64.4万元，1988年的产值突破1亿元，产值和利润连续八年翻八番，人均创利万元以上。它不仅是泰兴县、扬州市崛起的工业企业中的佼佼者，在全省167家中西药厂中也名列前茅。
      扬子江制药厂所以有今天，用徐镜人的话来说：“它是用所有职工的心血和汗水换来的！”
      时间回溯到1971年1月，口岸仪表厂成立了一个制药车间，这个畸形的胎儿，就是扬子江制药厂的前身了。这能算得上制药车间么？仅有六间房子、两个大水缸，十几个经过培训的工人。生产百尔定、百乃定两种针剂，用水量很大，可他们连水塔也没有。车间的负责人徐镜人就和工人一起，每天轮流到半里外的小河去挑水。制药一天用二十缸水。二十担水才能装满一缸。两个人一班去挑水，也得八九个小时！
    厂房太小，施展不开。徐镜人又找到一块荒地，领着大家挖土、平坟、填塘、挑砖、盖厂房。资金短缺，他不得不四处借款。为了节省出差费，职工们到县城去办事，就花七角钱租一辆自行车，还要选有支架的，好多载一个人。回来把汗湿的衣服一脱，马上进车间干起来。
      1971年9月初，两种针剂试制成功后，工人们眼噙着泪情不自禁地欢呼起来：“我们的第一炮打响了！”
    这一年的销售额虽不大，毕竟迈出了艰难的第一步。制药车间被镇政府批准为工农制药厂。这时候职工的工资，最低的9元，厂长徐镜人也只有23.5元。每天加班加点，谁都没有要过加班费，也没有一句怨言。大家从实干和创造中，发现了自己的特殊价值，现在能用自己的双手，为祖国人民治病造福了。对未来充满了憧憬和希望，这是扬子江人的梦，一个执著的美好的梦！
            祸从天降
      1985年4月间，为了迎接《国家药品管理法》的实施及“三证”（即生产、营业、卫生三项许可证）的颁发，厂里成立以徐厂长为首的企业整顿领导小组和企业整顿办公室，对生产、经营、质量、卫生、人员、厂房等九个方面进行严格的整顿。6月间，经省、市、县三级“三证”检查验收组验收确认合格，人们似乎可以喘一口气了。
      谁知祸从天降！
      验收组离厂没有多久，国内有几家报纸发出了一则有关他们厂的消息：“泰兴县制药厂口岸分厂向上海大量销售劣药”！有些医药报纸、杂志还纷纷予以转载。人们都为不久前发生的晋江假药事件吓怕了，现在又出一桩口岸劣药事件！
      口岸制药分厂立刻被蒙上一层可怕的阴影，退货电话与退货合同，不断地向厂里涌来。发出的货全部被封存，资金不能回笼，全厂被迫停产三个月，经济损失达到700万元。
      口岸制药分厂受到严峻的考验！
      徐镜人心忧如焚！他仿佛觉得有人冷不丁重重地打了他一闷棍。他实在不理解：怎么会发生这种颠倒黑白、诬谄他人的事情呢？啊，他渐渐地了解到：这一则无中生有、纯属谎言的“消息”，是根据某个行政部门收到的一封未经核实的“人民来信”，和某市医药经销单位在竞争的形势下，出于排挤外地药品的需要而编造的不实之词撰写的。他通过各种渠道，请求上级领导查清事实，以正视听！
      8月间，泰兴县、扬州市、江苏省药政部门联合调查组进厂了。紧接着，国家医药总局和省、市、县经销医药部门也派人来了。他们查阅了口岸制药厂两年来的发票、单据和生产记录，抽验了250个成药批号的留样，确认该厂所有的产品质量都是合格的。
    这一封“人民来信”，使一个新兴企业受到700万元的损失，还花费了20多个干部大半个月宝贵的时间，但诬谬毕竟澄清了。
    徐镜人和厂部的同志，并没有因此轻松起来。他们在致力于恢复工厂元气的同时，从“劣药”风波中吸取教训，在职工中开展了深入的产品质量意识教育，制订了超过国家规定的药品质量的内控标准，加强了产品质量的管理和检验。颇有讽刺意味的是，一时被人指责为“劣药”的板蓝根干糖浆，10月间在全省同类品种的评比中荣获第一名。
      11月间，扬州市计委批准泰兴制药厂口岸分厂改名为“扬州市扬子江制药厂”。从此，扬子江制药厂的旗帜，在长江之滨高高地飘扬起来了。
      新生命的交响曲
      1988年的一个秋雨之夜，徐厂长的办公室，闪烁着不灭的灯光。他不住地吸着烟，陷入了沉思中。烟缕变成了迷雾，在室内徐徐地升腾。
      在双增双节运动中，国家紧缩银根，压缩经济过热的现象。面对着市场不旺、厂外欠债太多、原材料涨价，“扬子江”遇到了前所未有的困难。作为厂长兼支部书记的徐镜人，凡是厂内的重大问题，他是能够说了算的。现在，他对自己设想的改革方案，也犹豫起来了。增产、翻番的计划不压缩，可能吗？他把另外四位厂级干部叫来了，这是他最得力的战友，他们交谈着、争辩着、探索着，直到黎明。
      深化改革的方案终于定下来了。他们以惊人的胆略和毅力，作出了许多机智而大胆的决策。
      市场上总有畅销、平销、滞销的产品，扬子江厂也不例外。让产品质量当开路先锋吧！我们就是要靠自己获奖的优质、名牌产品，才能批量地投放市场；同时根据市场的需要，不断地开发新产品。
      徐镜人亲自抓销售工作，使企业由生产型转向经营型。原来全厂销售员只有13人，他从全
  厂调来精兵强将，逐步扩大到30—50人，建立了除西藏外的全国销售网。坚持“用户至上，讲究信誉，方便服务，保证质量”的宗旨，宁可自己吃苦受累，也要送货上门。
      他还在企业内部进行深层次的改革：科室人员由100多人压缩为60多人；把年轻有为有威信的人，提拔到生产领导岗位上来；在车间实行优化劳动组合，实行纯计件工资制度，使每个职工各尽所能，多劳多得。
     为了保持企业的后劲，增强本厂产品的竞争力，成立了扬子江医药化工集团公司，与北京、南京的多家医药科研单位及化工、塑料厂等，建立巩固的合作关系。
    以往每年厂内的基建投资，都在三四百万元，现在除零星建设外，基建项目都下马了。
    有了恰当的经济措施，还要有党的思想政治工作作保证。这里的党、团、工会组织，经常对职工进行“坚韧不拔，锐意进取，团结协作，永不满足”的企业精神教育，和爱国主义、遵守法纪的教育，每个党员干部都联系一定数量的工人，协助车间做好思想工作。近十年来，厂里没有一个工人违法乱纪。
    艰难困苦，玉汝于成。全厂去年的产值突破1亿元的大关，利润1332万元。今年上半年完成产值5000万元，回笼货币4000万元。扬子江人迎着困难上，谱写了企业新生命的交响曲。
      堂堂正正地做人
      1986年4月间，国家医药总局的六个干部，来扬子江厂检查药品质量。一天深夜两点多钟，他们信步到几个车间去看了看。他们吃惊了，信服了，回来对人说：“车间里每个工人都在聚精会神地工作，生产秩序很好。没有一个人打磕睡，聊天。我们走了全国许多制药厂，像这样的厂子还少见！”
      郭友明是部队转业的汽车驾驶员。来扬子江开车以后，一贯勤勤恳恳地工作，后来当了汽车队长。有一次他驾驶“130”车到南京送药品时，驶在慢行道上的一辆“江淮”大卡车，突如其来地向快行道上来了个急拐弯。如“130”向右急煞车，就会撞在公路的交通岗亭上，把同车的小吴撞死，绝对不能这样做！他立即将车向左拐急煞车，“江淮”的尾巴撞着“130”，他的肝部被挤碎。小吴要把他送医院，他忍受着剧烈的疼痛，用发颤的声音说：“小吴，我不行了……你不要管我……车上有厂里的货，你快打电话向厂长汇报！……”小吴流着泪把队长送到医院，他刚上手术台就断了气。
      这不幸的消息传到厂内，徐厂长忍不住啜泣起来，好多同志难过得哭了。党支部追认郭友明为优秀党员，全厂开展了学习郭友明的活动。郭友明在全厂职工的心目中，永远是一个公而忘私、品德高尚的人！
      像郭友明这样默默地为厂工作的人，实在难以计数。有一种无形的强大的凝聚力，把人们求上进的心紧紧地联结在一起了。
      我访问过许多办厂元老、青年工人和科室人员，他们不约而同地告诉我：“我们厂的干部好，我们信得过！”徐厂长从来厂子以后，就住在厂里，吃在厂里，除了吃饭和夜里睡上五六小时觉，其余时间全用来工作。其他干部也跟他学，常常工作到夜深。他们为企业的生存、发展，真是操碎了心。他们的心里装着全厂的职工。在徐厂长的提议、热心支持下，一幢职工宿舍楼盖起来了，不少科技人员的“两地分居”的问题得到解决，每个工人午餐可以享受五角钱的营养补助费，十多位勤学的青年，被保送到药学院或其他大学去学习了。
    人们说：扬子江的风气正！
    徐镜人是口岸镇人，他在镇上的亲戚朋友太多了。扬子江厂越办越好，求他安排自己子女进厂的人也就多了。徐镜人说：“我现在不好给你答复。厂子招收职工时，你们来厂报名应考好了。”够条件的考上了，不合格的一个也不收。这样，全厂职工的文化、品德、身体素质都比较好。没有考进厂的人，难免要骂徐镜人“无情无义”。过久了，骂的人也知道，这是扬子江的招工制度，连徐厂长自己也不好违反的。
      在扬子江北厂的橱窗里，有徐镜人的大幅题字：清廉。这是他为人的守则，对职工也是这样要求的：人人要爱惜工厂的一切财物，绝不允许假公济私的现象发生。他还规定干部不许接受礼物和变相的“回扣”，销售员不能请客送礼。推销药品靠产品质量，靠正常的渠道（各地医药公司二级批发站），靠自己的信用、友情和周到的服务。多年来，这里不断有人拒收贿赂、小费，没有发生贪污、收贿现象。在社会上蔓延着不正之风的今天，这样堂堂正正地做人是难得的，这成为扬子江人精神上的一个亮点。“己不正，焉能正人！”如果徐镜人不严于律己，他是无权要求别人的。
      俗话说：“树大招风”。扬子江制药厂办大了，徐镜人在制药界出了名，有了点业绩，难免不遭到个别人的误解、非议和嫉妒。比较多的说法是：徐镜人骄傲。平时，他连普通工人的意见和建议，都很认真地听取，还多次带干部到苏南和本县一些先进企业去取经。他说：“办厂的压力很大，市场的竞争很激烈，即使想骄傲也难啊！”只是来厂访问、办事的人很多，他的工作过忙，照顾不到的情形是有的。
      一天，徐镜人的老同学奚宏盛问他：“老徐，你到底图个啥？何必把自己搞得这么苦呢？”徐镜人把双眼一眯，笑了笑说：“图啥？要办好这么个大厂子，还不够我干的？我个人损失点，豁出命，又算得了什么？”徐镜人的一位朋友，曾写了两句诗送给他：“不遭天磨非铁汉，不遭人嫉是庸才。”徐镜人沉思了一下，说：“我不愿意当庸才，只是想做一个堂堂正正有作为的人，一个问心无愧的人！”
      扬州市医药公司的副经理郁彪同志，听说我要采写扬子江的文章，主动来找我谈了半天，他说：“我是看着扬子江发展起来的人。像扬子江这样的好企业，像徐镜人这种开拓型的企业家，在我
  们地区不是很多的。全国能有1／3的企业这样做，
  我们的四化建设就很可观了！”
      扬州市内有座著名的古迹文丞相祠。民族英雄文天祥在扬州抗元的壮烈业绩，他在狱中所写的充满爱国激情的《正气歌》，一直激励着人们在艰难面前不屈服、奋勇地去创造新的生活。“是气所磅礴，凛烈万古存。当其贯日月，生死安足论！”“扬子江人”不畏挫折，不怕厄运，不怕险恶，从一个只有几间平房、两个水缸的小车间，建成了千人以上的社会主义的先进企业，谱写了一曲我们时代的正气歌。
      敬礼，艰苦创业的“扬子江人”！
