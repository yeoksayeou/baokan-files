The once barren mountains, wastelands, waters, and lands have now become the focus of agricultural comprehensive development. Vast areas of medium and low-yield fields and underutilized agricultural resources are being deeply developed. While the state organizes large-scale agricultural comprehensive development projects, many provinces, prefectures, and counties across the country are also carrying out agricultural comprehensive development activities tailored to their local conditions. Farmers are also spontaneously engaging in agricultural development beyond conventional farming. Currently, agricultural comprehensive development is gaining momentum nationwide.

Since the mid-1980s, China's agriculture has experienced several years of stagnation. The rapid growth of the national economy and population, along with the annual reduction of arable land, has increased the pressure on agricultural development. It is against this backdrop that large-scale agricultural comprehensive development has become an important source of momentum for China's agricultural development.

During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, the first batch of 111 commercial grain base counties funded by the state saw their grain production in 1987 and 1988 increase by nearly 4 billion kilograms compared to the two years before the construction. This year, it is estimated that production will increase by more than 2.5 billion kilograms, a growth rate of 6.8%, far exceeding the national average growth rate. The majority of the increased production in these base counties is commercial grain, with approximately 16.7 billion kilograms of commercial grain sold to the state in the past two years, increasing the commercialization rate from 26% before construction to 33%. Meanwhile, the state has also established a number of high-quality cotton base counties, high-quality agricultural product base counties, and a large number of famous and high-quality agricultural product base projects and export agricultural and sideline product base projects. Relevant officials said that these base construction projects have developed resources, increased production and social effective supply, and are the first step in China's agricultural comprehensive development.

Starting in 1988, the State Council decided to use the arable land occupation tax remitted to the central government to establish an agricultural comprehensive development fund (originally called the land development and construction fund), which is used for agricultural comprehensive development. This is the second step in China's large-scale agricultural comprehensive development. Last year, the state launched development projects in 11 major areas, including the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces, the Sanjiang Plain and Songliao Plain in Northeast China, as well as Zhejiang, Guangxi, and Xinjiang. This year, development projects were launched in eight additional regions, including Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Hainan, and the Yellow River Delta.

Overall, the agricultural development momentum formed in various places has several prominent features: from the outset, the guiding ideology has been to focus on transforming medium and low-yield fields while expanding arable land; from the outset, the policy has been to increase the production of grain, cotton, meat, oil, and sugar, and to comprehensively develop and improve mountains, water, fields, villages, and roads; from the outset, emphasis has been placed on technological investment, developing technological contracting, and combining technology with resource development; from the outset, multi-channel and multi-level fundraising has been advocated, with east, west, south, and north joint development, combining with the broad masses of farmers' labor accumulation as the main input, forming a huge development force; from the outset, it has been advocated to implement large-scale management for newly developed resources, combining the advantages of unified socialized services with farmers' enthusiasm for contract responsibility systems. Now, various departments and research institutions related to agriculture under the central government are actively participating in the development, and provinces and regions without state-funded projects have also established their own development projects. Farmers have shown great enthusiasm for developing agriculture, and in some places, the income from developing agriculture has exceeded that of conventional agriculture. After initially tasting the benefits, farmers have invested large amounts of manpower, material resources, and funds into agricultural development.

State Councilor Chen Junsheng pointed out that through agricultural comprehensive development, existing resources are increased with material and technological inputs, unit area productivity is improved, and output efficiency is increased. At the same time, new utilizable resources are developed and utilized, increasing effective supply. This will be an effective way for China's agriculture to break through stagnation and reach a new level.

　　农业综合开发形成高潮
　　陈俊生称这是突破徘徊再上新台阶的有效途径
    本报北京11月29日讯　新华社记者王言彬、本报记者陈健报道：昔日大片的荒山、荒滩、荒水、荒地，如今已成为农业综合开发的“问津”之处，广大的中低产田和未被充分利用的农业资源正在得到深度开发。在国家组织大规模综合农业开发项目的同时，全国一些省、地、县也因地制宜开展农业综合开发活动。广大农民也在常规农业之外自发地经营起开发农业。目前，全国综合农业开发正在走向热潮。
    我国农业从80年代中期开始连续几年徘徊，国民经济和人口的高速增长，耕地面积的逐年减少，使农业面临的发展压力越来越大。正是在这种背景下，大规模的农业综合开发开始成为我国农业发展后劲的一个重要源泉。
    “七五”期间第一批国家投资建设的111个商品粮基地县，1987和1988年的粮食产量比建设前的两年粮食产量增长近40亿公斤，今年预计比去年增产25亿多公斤，增长幅度达6.8％，远高于全国的平均增长幅度。这些基地县增产的绝大部分是商品粮，近两年共向国家交售商品粮约167亿公斤，商品率由建设前的26％提高到33％。与此同时，国家还先后建设了一批优质棉基地县，优质农产品基地县以及一大批名优农产品基地项目和出口农副产品基地项目。有关方面人士说，这些基地建设开发了资源，增加了产量和社会有效供给，是我国农业综合开发的第一步。
    1988年开始，国务院决定用上交中央的耕地占用税设立农业综合开发基金（原称土地开发建设基金），用于农业的综合开发，这是我国农业大规模综合开发的第二步。去年国家在冀、鲁、豫、苏、皖五省的黄淮海平原、东北的三江平原、松辽平原以及浙江、广西、新疆三省（区）等11大片立项进行开发；今年又先后在四川、湖北、湖南、江西、宁夏、内蒙古、海南及黄河口三角洲等八片地区立项进行开发。
    从总体上看，各地形成的农业开发热潮有几个突出的特点：一开始就明确了以改造中低产田为重点，同扩大耕地面积相结合的指导思想；一开始就确定了以增产粮、棉、肉、油、糖为内容，山、水、田、村、路综合开发治理的方针；一开始就注重科技投入，发展科技承包，把科技与资源开发结合起来；一开始就提倡多渠道，多层次筹集资金，东西南北联合开发，同广大农民劳务积累这个投入主体相结合，形成巨大的开发力量；一开始就提倡对大面积新开发的资源实行规模经营，把统一社会化服务的优越性和联产承包的农民积极性结合起来等。现在，中央与农业有关的各部委和科研单位纷纷参与开发，国家没有立项的省区也都确立了本地的开发项目。广大农民对开发农业表现出了很高的热情，有的地方，农民开发农业收益已超过了常规农业。初步尝到甜头后，农民又大量将人财物力投入开发农业。
    国务委员陈俊生指出，通过农业综合开发，即对现有资源增加物资技术投入，提高单位面积产量，增加产出效率，同时使可利用的新资源得到开发利用，增加有效供给。这将是我国农业突破徘徊、再上新台阶的有效途径。
