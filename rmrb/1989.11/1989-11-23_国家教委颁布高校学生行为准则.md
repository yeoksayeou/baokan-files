People's Daily, Beijing, November 22nd - Reporter Wei Yufeng reports: The State Education Commission today issued the "Trial Guidelines for College Student Behavior," which will be implemented starting November 17th.

A relevant official from the State Education Commission said at today's press conference that the guidelines for college student behavior are an important regulation in higher education. The purpose of formulating and implementing these guidelines is to better carry out the Party's educational policy and cultivate well-rounded individuals who are both red and expert, the successors of the socialist cause.

The full text of the "Trial Guidelines for College Student Behavior" is as follows:

College students and graduate students should have a firm and correct political direction. They should love the socialist motherland, support the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system, and strive to learn Marxism. They should be enthusiastic about reform and opening up, have a spirit of hard work, follow the path of integrating with the workers and peasants, and strive to serve the people. They should dedicate themselves to realizing socialism with Chinese characteristics and modernizing the country. They should consciously abide by the constitution and laws, strictly follow school rules and regulations, strengthen their sense of law, and have good morals. They should study diligently and strive to master modern scientific and cultural knowledge. They should aim to become qualified personnel for the socialist modernization drive who have ideals, morals, culture, and discipline, and be successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. In their daily lives, they should consciously follow the following behavioral guidelines.

1. Safeguard the interests of the motherland. Do not participate in any activities that harm the dignity and honor of the motherland, go against the four cardinal principles, or disrupt social order. Oppose actions that disrupt stability and unity.

2. Abide by the constitution and all laws and regulations of the state. Strive to be examples of maintaining democracy and the rule of law, and oppose anarchism.

3. Maintain equality, unity, and mutual aid among all ethnic groups. Respect the customs and religious beliefs of different ethnic groups, and oppose actions that harm ethnic unity.

4. Adhere to socialist collectivism. Personal interests should be subordinate to national and collective interests; classmates should be united, friendly, and help each other; care for the collective; and oppose extreme individualism.

5. Adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts. Speak with factual basis, and act based on reality; conduct criticism and self-criticism correctly.

6. Love labor and actively participate in social practice. Actively participate in public welfare labor, production labor, and part-time work-study activities, and learn humbly from workers and peasants; do not engage in commercial activities.

7. Carry forward the spirit of hard work. Be thrifty and not wasteful of water, electricity, and food; do not make unreasonable living demands on the school and family.

8. Pay attention to personal moral cultivation. Dress neatly, maintain hygiene; be honest and trustworthy, humble and cautious; speak kindly, treat others with courtesy; interact with the opposite sex appropriately; respect teachers and others; respect the elderly and help the young; be willing to help others; and dare to fight against bad behavior.

9. Actively participate in physical exercise and healthy cultural activities to improve physical and mental health.

10. Study diligently and work hard. While striving to complete all study tasks, establish a learning style that combines scientific and revolutionary qualities.

11. Maintain teaching order. Follow study discipline and do not cheat during exams.

12. Maintain public order. Follow relevant regulations in public places, do not disturb the order, and do not incite trouble; follow the school's campus management system, do not fight or gamble, do not drink excessively, do not watch or spread reactionary and obscene publications and audio-visual products; do not smoke in no-smoking areas.

13. Follow dormitory management regulations. Turn off the lights and go to bed on time, do not make noise or disturb others' normal study and rest; do not damage or tamper with dormitory equipment; do not have overnight guests of the opposite sex; do not allow outsiders to stay overnight without permission from relevant departments.

14. Protect public property. Protect public facilities, cherish plants and trees; treasure teaching and research equipment; compensate for any damage to public property.

15. Follow foreign affairs discipline. Do not do anything that harms national dignity or personal dignity in foreign activities; treat foreign students equally and friendly; treat foreign teachers and international friends with courtesy, neither too humble nor too arrogant.
