All compatriots in Macao are determined to fight to the end and will not rest until they achieve complete victory. The meeting adopted a protest letter to the Portuguese authorities, putting forward six serious demands.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 10th: Over a hundred representatives from various circles in Macao held a meeting this morning and unanimously adopted a strongly worded protest letter condemning the Portuguese authorities' heinous crimes of brutal slaughter and persecution of Macao Chinese compatriots. They immediately dispatched representatives to submit this protest letter to the Portuguese Governor of Macao, Carlos Caeiro.

The protest letter from Macao compatriots from various circles pointed out that the series of heinous crimes committed by the Portuguese authorities in persecuting Macao compatriots are absolutely intolerable, and the Portuguese authorities must bear full responsibility for their bloody crimes. The protest letter solemnly declared that the Portuguese authorities must accept and implement the following six demands:

1. Immediately severely punish the executioners who indiscriminately slaughtered Macao Chinese compatriots. Immediately dismiss and investigate the chief culprits, Fook Yee, Yim Tin-ni, and Yim Tak-kei.

2. Immediately lift the martial law, immediately stop arrests, stop the slaughter and stop the persecution of Macao Chinese compatriots. Absolutely guarantee the personal safety and freedom of Macao Chinese compatriots.

3. Immediately compensate for all losses of the injured, immediately console the families of the martyrs, bear the funeral expenses of the martyrs, and not interfere with Macao compatriots holding funerals and memorial services for the martyrs.

4. Immediately release all Macao Chinese compatriots arrested in the fascist bloody crackdown, and publish the complete and true list of casualties.

5. Immediately implement the five demands of the Taipa Residents' School Preparatory Committee and the five demands of the Macao Federation of Chinese Students.

6. Immediately confess to Macao compatriots in person and sign a confession, and publish this confession in newspapers and on the radio, ensuring that there will be no more incidents of persecuting Macao Chinese compatriots in the future.

The protest letter concluded by stating that the Portuguese authorities must quickly respond to the acceptance of the above six demands, otherwise, all consequences arising from this will be the full responsibility of the Portuguese authorities.

At the beginning of the meeting, all representatives stood in silence to mourn the martyred compatriots and unanimously condemned the Portuguese authorities' heinous crimes. After the protest letter was adopted, the meeting immediately selected Liang Pei, Ho Hin, Tam Lap-ming, Yung Po-shan, and Yuen Tse-wong, among thirteen others, to represent Macao compatriots and submit the protest letter to the "Governor's Office." Before the thirteen representatives departed, all representatives stood and read aloud Chairman Mao's quotation: "Resolutely determine to overcome all difficulties and win victory."

The thirteen representatives arrived at the "Governor's Office" and solemnly read and submitted the protest letter to the Portuguese Governor, Carlos Caeiro.

The meeting of representatives from various circles in Macao also resolved to establish a funeral committee to hold a memorial service for the martyred Chinese compatriots; to form a "Macao Compatriots' Condolence Delegation" to visit the families of the martyred and injured compatriots. The resolution demands that the Portuguese authorities immediately publish the true list of Chinese compatriots who were killed, injured, and arrested, and entrust the Macao Federation of Trade Unions to accept the registration of the families of the victims (including those killed, injured, arrested, and missing) and all other victims.

The meeting of representatives from various circles in Macao unanimously expressed that all Macao compatriots are determined to fight to the end, and will not rest until they achieve complete victory.
