Soldiers love the "Three Articles," every word and sentence shines with brilliance.
Study the "Three Articles" every day, cast aside selfish thoughts and desires.
Continuously study the "Three Articles," dare to face difficulties with courage.
Forever study the "Three Articles," communism will surely be realized.

The resounding songs praising the "Three Articles" linger in people's minds. These songs inspire the actors on stage and the audience below. The songs are the most beautiful, the lyrics the most touching, and the music the most melodious. They express people's boundless faith in Mao Zedong Thought, their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, and the strongest voice of the times advocating Mao Zedong Thought.

The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tianjin formed a Mao Zedong Thought Art Propaganda Team, which brought the "Three Articles" to the stage during their propaganda activities in Tianjin City, adding new splendor to the proletarian art stage.

New themes, new content, new forms

Comrade Lin Biao instructed: "The 'Three Articles' should be studied as a motto. Every level should study them. After studying, they should be applied, and ideological revolutionization should be carried out." The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army enthusiastically responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call, memorizing the "Three Articles," and using them as their guiding principles for action; they imprinted the "Three Articles" in their minds, infused them into their blood, and put them into practice. They said, "The 'Three Articles' are the red three articles, the introductory articles, and the most powerful weapon for transforming one's worldview. They must be studied with full enthusiasm, wholeheartedly, and with great effort, even to the point of neglecting sleep and food. They must be applied after studying, to eliminate bourgeois ideas and establish proletarian ideals, to break down private interests and establish public interests, and to transform one's worldview. How can the new situation of the army studying and applying Chairman Mao's works be reflected on stage? The soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain naval unit in Tianjin discussed this late into the night. They felt that simply singing the aphorisms of the "Three Articles" on stage and reciting the aphorisms of the "Three Articles" was far from enough to fully express Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts and the soldiers' love for the "Three Articles." They decided: to bring the full text of the "Three Articles" to the stage.

How to bring the full text of the "Three Articles" to the stage? This is a new topic. During the discussion, the soldiers of the propaganda team unanimously said: "Overcome all difficulties to achieve victory, and use the spirit of the 'Three Articles' to propagate the 'Three Articles'!" They said, "Anything that restricts our propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought and hinders our expression of our boundless love for Mao Zedong Thought, no matter what kind of framework it is, must be smashed!" They collectively created a brand-new program: a collective recitation of "In Memory of Norman Bethune." They used aphorism songs, poetic performances, male and female voice recitations, and couplet dialogues to connect the full text of "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and brought it to the stage. They also created and performed "Learning the 'Three Articles' Lecture," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Dialogue on Remembering Norman Bethune," and "Promoting the Character 'Public.'" These programs were warmly welcomed by the audience as soon as they met them, and the entire theater was filled with the fusion of emotions between the actors and the audience. The great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the stage, the theater, and the hearts of every audience member.

Study the "Three Articles," perform the "Three Articles," and apply the "Three Articles"

The soldiers of the performance team said, "The key to performing the 'Three Articles' well is to first study the 'Three Articles' well and apply them well. If one's worldview is not transformed, it is impossible to perform the 'Three Articles' well. To be a lifelong propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought, one must study the 'Three Articles' for a lifetime and apply them for a lifetime."

During the more than twenty days of over one hundred and thirty performances, the soldiers always used the "Three Articles" to guide their actions. After each performance, the soldiers enthusiastically sent off the audience and, without regard for fatigue, picked up brooms to clean the stage and the theater. The soldiers said: "Every time we pick up the broom, our hearts are very excited. This is not just ordinary sweeping; it is sweeping away the selfish thoughts and desires in our minds and sweeping away the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes."

Performing the "Three Articles" and applying the "Three Articles," the soldiers brought a new spirit to the stage. Even some new soldiers who had only been in the army for a few months bravely took to the stage to perform. They learned from Zhang Zedong's spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, learned from Norman Bethune's extreme responsibility to his work, and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people. With the spirit of moving mountains, they took to the stage and enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought. There was a soldier who originally played the accordion accompaniment and had a less pleasant voice. He always thought that his singing was not pleasant and had never sung on stage before. This time, he broke through his mental barriers, not only playing the accompaniment but also participating in the singing of "Soldiers Love to Read the 'Three Articles'" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." In the lecture on applying Chairman Mao's works after the performance, he said: "What is pleasant, what is not pleasant? Singing to propagate Mao Zedong Thought is pleasant. The audience does not first listen to the melody of the song, but first listens to the political content. If Mao Zedong Thought is not sung, even if the voice is very good, the sound that comes out is not pleasant!"

Every soldier in the performance team regards propagating Mao Zedong Thought as their lifelong most glorious combat mission, greatest happiness, and greatest joy, never forgetting their glorious title as propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. With boundless loyalty, love, admiration, and worship for Chairman Mao, and a deep affection for Mao Zedong Thought, they took to the stage. Every word, every song, every dance, every action, and every expression were infused with their emotions and performed.

The process of performing the "Three Articles" is also the process of the soldiers of the propaganda team studying the "Three Articles," applying the "Three Articles," and continuously transforming and improving their thoughts. They deeply felt: "To make the content of the program red, one must be red and one's thoughts must be red."

Turning the stage into a grand classroom for Mao Zedong Thought

In just over twenty days, the soldiers performed eighty-five programs praising the "Three Articles" and heroes who grew up under the nurturing of the "Three Articles" for more than 260,000 audiences in Tianjin City. These programs were extremely warmly welcomed by the audience. The soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team discussed the following question in the lecture on applying Chairman Mao's works: "Why are the programs propagating the 'Three Articles' the most welcome?"

A worker, after watching the program, ran onto the stage to shake hands with the soldiers, excitedly saying: "What we workers think in our hearts and want to say with our mouths, you have sung out; what we most want to see and need to see, you have brought to us." The words of this worker deeply answered this question.

"The 'Three Articles' are the sharpest weapons for transforming one's worldview. On stage, off stage, the relationship between the actors and the audience has changed. The actors are no longer just performing art programs on stage, and the audience is no longer just appreciating art programs off stage. Instead, they are jointly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, jointly studying and applying the 'Three Articles,' and jointly carrying out a revolution in their souls, turning the stage into a grand classroom for propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

The audience, in order to make the programs performed to propagate Mao Zedong Thought more prominent, more distinct, and more effective, actively and enthusiastically helped the performance team to modify and improve. The collective recitation of "In Memory of Norman Bethune" originally ended with the recitation of the last paragraph of the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Some audience members thought that this handling could not bring the audience's emotions to a climax at the end. The soldiers of the performance team, based on the opinions of the audience, carefully made modifications, adding a collective singing of the aphorism song "Completely and Thoroughly for the People" at the end. The next day, the effect was very good. "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary armies. Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and is thoroughly working for the interests of the people." Clear thoughts, powerful melodies, and resounding and majestic songs, combined with the actors' firm and determined steps as they marched into the backstage, immediately brought the entire venue to a climax, and thunderous applause echoed throughout the theater. This applause expressed the audience's boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought from the bottom of their hearts.

The great Mao Zedong Thought tightly fused the revolutionary combat friendship between the actors and the audience. A group of Red Guards watched the performance and presented each soldier of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit stationed in Tianjin with a precious Chairman Mao badge. The soldiers solemnly held a badge-presentation ceremony and, with boundless excitement, took an oath: "We swear to be lifelong propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought and let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all artistic fronts!"

### 满怀激情歌颂“老三篇”——记解放军驻天津部队战士组成的毛泽东思想文艺宣传队的演出活动

    满怀激情歌颂“老三篇”
    ——记解放军驻天津部队战士组成的毛泽东思想文艺宣传队的演出活动
    战士最爱“老三篇”，字字句句金光闪。
    天天学习“老三篇”，私心杂念抛一边。
    不断学习“老三篇”，敢字当头不怕难。
    永远学习“老三篇”，共产主义定实现。
    歌颂“老三篇”的嘹亮歌声，久久地回荡在人们的脑子中。这歌声激励着舞台上的演员，激励着舞台下的观众。这歌声是最动听的，词句是最感人的，乐曲是最优美的，它唱出了人们对毛泽东思想无限信仰的心情，唱出了对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情，唱出了大立毛泽东思想的时代最强音。
    中国人民解放军驻天津部队战士组成的毛泽东思想文艺宣传队，在天津市开展宣传活动时，把“老三篇”搬上舞台，使无产阶级文艺舞台放出了新的异彩。
        新课题，新内容，新形式
    林彪同志指示：要把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学。哪一级都要学。学了就要用，搞好思想革命化。中国人民解放军广大指战员，热烈响应林彪同志的号召，把“老三篇”熟读，背诵下来，作为自己行动的指南；把“老三篇”印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。他们说，“老三篇”是红三篇，是入门篇，是改造世界观的最强大武器，一定要满腔热情地学，全心全意地学，废寝忘食地学，拚死拚活地学，学了就用，灭资兴无，破私立公，改造世界观。怎么才能把部队活学活用毛主席著作的这个新形势在舞台上反映出来呢？驻天津海军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的战士们一直讨论到深夜。他们感到，只是在台上唱“老三篇”的语录歌，读“老三篇”的语录，远远不能把毛主席的光辉思想充分表达出来，不能把战士们热爱“老三篇”的感情充分唱出来。他们决定：把“老三篇”全文搬上舞台。
    怎样把“老三篇”全文搬上舞台？这是个新的课题。讨论当中，宣传队的战士们一致表示：“排除万难，去争取胜利，用‘老三篇’的精神宣传‘老三篇’！”他们说，凡是束缚我们宣传毛泽东思想，妨碍我们表达对毛泽东思想无限热爱心情的，不管是什么框框，一律打碎！他们集体创作了一个崭新的节目：齐颂《为人民服务》。他们用语录歌、诗表演、男女声朗诵、对口词等几种形式，把《为人民服务》的全文联贯起来，搬上了舞台。他们又创作演出了表演唱《学习“老三篇”讲用会》、说唱《愚公移山》、对话《纪念白求恩》、对口词《提倡一个“公”字》等。这些节目同群众一见面，就受到观众的热烈欢迎，整个剧场里，演员和观众的感情交融在一起。毛泽东思想的伟大光辉照红了舞台，照红了剧场，照红了每个观众的心。
  学“老三篇”，演“老三篇”，用“老三篇”
    演出队的战士们说，“演好‘老三篇’的关键，是首先自己要学好‘老三篇’，用好‘老三篇’。不改造好自己的世界观，就不可能演好‘老三篇’。当一辈子毛泽东思想宣传员，就要学一辈子‘老三篇’，用一辈子‘老三篇’。”
    在历时二十多天的一百三十多场演出中，战士们始终用“老三篇”指导自己的行动。每场演出结束，战士们热情送走了观众，就不顾疲劳，拿起扫帚打扫舞台，打扫剧场。战士们说：“每当拿起扫帚的时候，心情都非常激动。这不是一般的扫地，而是在扫走我们脑子里的私心杂念，扫掉资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯。”
    演“老三篇”，用“老三篇”，战士们给舞台带来了一片新风。有的入伍只有几个月的新战士，也勇敢地登台演出。他们学习张思德“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的精神，学习白求恩对工作的极端负责任，对同志对人民极端热忱的精神，用愚公移山的精神登上舞台，满腔热情地宣传毛泽东思想。有个战士本来是担任手风琴伴奏的，嗓子不太好，过去总以为自己唱的歌不好听，一向没有在台上唱过。这次，他打破了自己思想上的框框，既担任伴奏，又参加了《战士爱读“老三篇”》、《为人民服务》等节目的演唱。他在演出后举行的活学活用毛主席著作讲用会上说：“什么叫好听，什么叫不好听？唱宣传毛泽东思想的歌就好听。观众不是首先听歌曲的调子，而是首先听政治内容。如果不唱毛泽东思想，即使嗓子再好，唱出来的声音也不好听！”
    每一个演出队的战士都把宣传毛泽东思想做为自己毕生最光荣的战斗任务，最大的幸福，最大的快乐，时刻不忘记自己是毛泽东思想宣传员这一光荣称号。他们怀着对毛主席无限忠诚、无限热爱、无限敬仰、无限崇拜，和对毛泽东思想坚定信仰的深厚感情，登上舞台，一字一句，一歌一舞，每一个动作，每一个表情，都把自己的感情溶化进去，表演出来。
    演“老三篇”的过程，也是宣传队的战士们学“老三篇”，用“老三篇”，不断改造、提高自己思想的过程。他们最深刻地体会到：“要想节目内容红，必须人红思想红。”
      把舞台变成毛泽东思想的大课堂
    在短短的二十多天内，战士们给天津市二十六万多观众演出了八十五个歌颂“老三篇”和在“老三篇”哺育下成长起来的英雄人物的节目。这些节目，都受到了观众极其热烈的欢迎。毛泽东思想宣传队的战士们，在活学活用毛主席著作讲用会上都讨论了这样一个问题：“为什么宣传‘老三篇’的节目最受欢迎？”
    一个工人看完节目，跑上台去握住战士的手，激动地说：“我们工人心里想的，嘴里要说的，你们给唱出来了；我们最爱看，最需要看的节目，你们给我们送来了。”这位工人的话，深刻地回答了这个问题。
      “老三篇”是改造世界观的最锐利的武器。台上演，台下看，演员和观众的关系发生了变化。演员已经不只是在台上演文艺节目，观众也不只是在台下欣赏文艺节目，而是在共同活学活用毛主席著作，活学活用“老三篇”，一起在灵魂深处闹革命，把舞台变成了宣传毛泽东思想的大课堂。
    观众们为了使演出的节目宣传毛泽东思想更突出，更鲜明，效果更好，主动热情地帮助演出队修改提高。齐诵《为人民服务》结尾原来是朗诵《为人民服务》文章的最后一段，有些观众看了认为这样处理不能在最后使观众的感情达到高潮。演出队的战士们根据观众的意见，认真地进行了修改，在结尾时加了齐唱《完全彻底为人民》的语录歌。第二天一演出，效果非常好。“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”鲜明的思想，有力的曲调，嘹亮雄壮的歌声，配合演员整队走入后台时雄赳赳的坚定步伐，顿时使全场气氛出现了高潮，雷动的掌声响彻了整个剧场。这掌声，表达了观众们从内心里迸发出来的对伟大领袖毛主席，对光辉的毛泽东思想无限热爱的感情。
    伟大的毛泽东思想把演员和观众的革命战斗友情紧紧地融合在一起。一群红卫兵小将看过演出，给驻津某部毛泽东思想宣传队的战士们每人送上一枚珍贵的毛主席像章。战士们隆重地举行了一次授章仪式，他们怀着无比的激动心情宣誓：“誓当一辈子毛泽东思想宣传员，让毛泽东思想占领一切文艺阵地！”
