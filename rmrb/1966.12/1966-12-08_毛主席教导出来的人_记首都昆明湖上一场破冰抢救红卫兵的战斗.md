**Editor's Note:** Reading this report is exhilarating and inspiring. This moving example fully demonstrates the high revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it shows the new spirit of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as the revolutionary young people. This is another triumphant song of great Mao Zedong Thought resonating through the skies.

When one Red Guard fell into an ice hole, hundreds of class brothers rushed forward to engage in a heroic rescue battle. What does this incident show?

It fully shows that the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage and created a new situation. Mao Zedong Thought is being grasped by more and more people. Chairman Mao's teachings are penetrating deeper into people's hearts. Chairman Mao's words are imprinted in the minds of the revolutionary people, dissolved in their blood, and put into action.

It fully shows that the people of China, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, have greatly promoted the spirit of communism that is selfless and dedicated to the collective. The heroic images of Chairman Mao's good soldiers, such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, and Cai Yongxiang, live in the hearts of millions, inspiring people to create more heroic deeds. Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and class brothers from more than ten provinces and municipalities participated in this heart-pounding rescue struggle, which is the most powerful proof.

Let us raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, further launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and unite the thoughts of the people of the entire nation with the great Mao Zedong Thought. We will be invincible wherever we go.

The day after our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao received the Cultural Revolution Army for the eighth time — November 27 — many revolutionary students and teachers from outside Beijing, with hearts full of warmth and happiness, came to the Western Suburbs People's Park (Summer Palace) to visit. Although it was winter, the entire park was full of spring. There was singing and laughter everywhere. Revolutionary young people from all over the country excitedly discussed the unforgettable scenes of being inspected by the great leader Chairman Mao.

Just at this joyful moment, something exciting happened.

**Chairman Mao's Words Are Orders**

At 4:30 PM, on the west side of the Seventeen-Arch Bridge on Nanhu Island in Kunming Lake, a sudden shout echoed: "Save people! Save people!" People followed the shout and saw that on the northeast side of the lake, about a hundred meters from the shore, a Red Guard who had fallen into the water was struggling in an ice hole, in a very dangerous situation. Chairman Mao's teachings about "all revolutionaries must care for, love, and help each other" instantly flashed through the minds of many people. People, as if receiving an order, rushed from all directions to the scene. A worker comrade quickly took off his clothes and rushed onto the ice from the east side of the lake; a Red Guard from Wanxian, Sichuan, quickly jumped down from the more than three-meter-high Seventeen-Arch Bridge; a 14-year-old young fighter from Yian County, Heilongjiang, ran quickly from the small hill on Nanhu Island to the shore, crossed the stone railing, and leaped into the icy lake...

A tense battle began.

The ice layers creaked and groaned, threatening to collapse at any moment. But people paid no heed to these dangers. Some held bamboo poles, others pushed ladders, all advancing towards a common goal.

The river is deep, the sea is deep, but class love is deeper. As long as the Red Guard comrades can escape, what is their own safety worth! A Red Guard comrade from Jilin, Tian Chunyin, saw the icy water and thought of his right leg arthritis. Should he jump in or not? He suddenly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: when faced with a task, never think of yourself first! So, he hesitated no more and joined the battle.

There will be sacrifices in struggle! Revolutionaries must not fear risks! Because the ice in the lake's heart was thin, those who went up all fell into the ice hole. Sharp ice blocks cut their skin; biting cold gripped their hearts and throats. They couldn't breathe, their limbs gradually became numb, but those armed with Mao Zedong Thought did not falter or retreat. Even in difficulty, they thought of others. Having heard Chairman Mao's words, they feared no great hardships.

In this brave fighting team, there was a tall young man wearing a military cap. He stood in the ice water up to his neck, swinging his fists at the hard ice. Ice blocks tore his clothes and cut his arms and chest; but he was like an unstoppable icebreaker, advancing, advancing... He was a soldier from a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region's "Hero Eighth Company," named Guo Wenxing, now a political worker for the Red Guards. The day before, he led a platoon of Red Guards to be inspected by Chairman Mao; this day, he led the young fighters to the park for a tour. When he heard the shouts and saw the danger of the fallen comrade, Chairman Mao's teachings echoed in his ears; the heroic images of Luo Shengtao, Cai Yongxiang, and others reappeared before his eyes. He rushed from the east shore towards the lake's heart without hesitation, running and taking off his cotton clothes, determined to give his all. But just as he had walked about twenty meters towards the fallen person, a "crack" sounded, and he too fell into the ice hole. The icy water instantly covered his head. He surfaced, steadied himself, and found that a worker and several Red Guards nearby had also fallen into the ice hole, struggling and unable to move. He first saved the nearest Red Guard to the shore, then used his fists to break open a ten-meter-long path on the ice, rescuing the worker. By then, Guo Wenxing felt his limbs numb and unsteady. The cold wind made his body convulse, and he found it hard to take a step. But when he saw that the fallen comrade on the west shore had not been rescued, Chairman Mao's words, "Develop the spirit of daring to fight, daring to sacrifice, and daring to endure hardships, and the spirit of continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)," echoed in his ears. Instantly, he found boundless strength, pushed away those supporting him, and in his wet underwear and shorts, barefoot, ran across the Seventeen-Arch Bridge and re-entered the battle.

At the same time, Air Force instructors Zhu Tangsheng and Hu Binglei from the northwestern region of the country were also bravely rescuing the Red Guards who had fallen into the ice hole. Zhu Tangsheng said to Hu Binglei, "The Red Guards are guests invited by Chairman Mao. If anything happens to them, we will be disloyal to Chairman Mao!"

The Red Guard young fighters struggling in the icy water were greatly inspired by the heroic deeds of the PLA comrades. They decided to follow the PLA in breaking a path on the ice to approach the fallen Red Guards. One fist, two fists, ten meters, twenty meters... As time passed, their breathing became more difficult, and many began to sink.

At this moment, the Red Guard young fighters on the shore also rushed to the stone railing, ready to jump down. But they were stopped by several PLA comrades. The soldiers told them that the support work on the shore was also important.

Bamboo poles, wooden planks, ropes, through countless hands, were passed onto the ice, strongly supporting the comrades in the water. The young fighters on the shore knew that their comrades fighting in the water needed Mao Zedong Thought the most. They shouted in unison:

	"Determine to fight, unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."
	"Determine to fight, unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."
	"..."

These are Chairman Mao's words! This is the call of our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao!

On the shore, on the ice, in the water, everyone's hearts were tightly bound together by these words. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Following your words, we fear no great hardships! Chairman Mao! I will definitely be your good soldier.

A Red Guard from Heilongjiang's Hailin County, Xing Yunfa, fell into the ice hole while rescuing the fallen comrade. Just as he surfaced from under the ice, he suddenly saw a red light and realized that his "Quotations from Chairman Mao" had fallen into the lake. He told himself, "Everything can be lost, but Chairman Mao's book cannot be lost." He immediately retrieved the shining red book and held it high. It was as if he saw Chairman Mao again. The day before, when he was inspected by Chairman Mao, he had written in the front page of this red book with boundless love for the great leader: "The great leader Chairman Mao walked past me, this is my greatest happiness!" He silently vowed to Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao! I will definitely always follow your words and be your good soldier! Chairman Mao inspired him to continue fighting. He stepped into the water with another comrade to rescue the fallen Red Guard. But due to the continuous collapse of the ice, his several attempts failed, his head was submerged in water, and he was choking on the icy water, feeling dizzy.

Just at this moment, Xing Yunfa heard the shore shouting, "Determine to fight, unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and his spirit suddenly revived. He opened his eyes and saw a PLA comrade breaking the ice towards him. He remembered the scene of studying this quotation with the PLA political worker during his visit to Beijing; he remembered the story of the "Bridge of Ten" told by the PLA comrades the night before: During the Huaihai Campaign, ten of our comrades braved the gunfire and built a human bridge in the river, ensuring the forward advance of the assaulting troops. I must learn from the PLA and follow Chairman Mao's instructions, unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory. Now is the time to test me, and it is also my opportunity to learn from the PLA. With all his strength, he and the surrounding comrades pushed the fallen comrade onto the extended ladder and himself swam towards the shore along the newly broken ice path until he fainted in the water and was rescued to the shore.

The battle had lasted for more than an hour. Most of the fallen comrades had been rescued to the shore. At this time, Guo Wenxing, who had broken a path with his body, was in a semi-unconscious state but still fighting. He carried a frozen comrade on his back and supported two others, letting them climb onto him, step by step moving towards the shore; his mouth still recited: "No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person, this person must continue to fight." — This is a quotation from Chairman Mao that the soldiers of his "Hero Eighth Company" often recite. Over the years, whenever this company encountered difficulties, they would follow the example of the heroic predecessors of the heroic company, loudly reciting this quotation to welcome victory. From the shore, a human ladder was hung down, and several hands stretched out, barely pulling Guo Wenxing up from the embankment.

	"Is there still someone in the water?"
	"No."
	"We have won!"
	"You are the collective Luo Shengtao! The collective Cai Yongxiang!" Countless people on the shore excitedly gathered around them. Mao Zedong Thought has united us.

The battle had not ended. The struggle to rescue the frozen comrades was still intense.

When one by one the comrades who had jumped into the water came ashore, countless friendly hands immediately passed over coats, sweaters, and pants; everyone carried or supported them to the Nanhu Restaurant on the island.

The Nanhu Restaurant was filled with people. The restaurant staff had already vacated their beds and lit the stoves. The stove warmed the bodies, and the sincere class feelings warmed the hearts.

Several Red Guard young fighters held hot water and hot liquor, carefully prying open the frozen jaws of the frozen comrades and pouring the liquid down. Soldier Li Huizhu hugged the Red Guard from Sichuan tightly in his arms, unbuttoned his clothes, and warmed his chest with his scorching heart. A Red Guard from Hunan opened his shirt and put Guo Wenxing's frozen legs under his warm armpits. Other Red Guards put their comrades' hands on their cheeks, wishing to transfer all their body heat to their dearest comrades in an instant. Revolutionary young fighter Liu Changhui was busy among the crowd. She took off her coat and gave it to the Air Force instructor Zhu Tangsheng who had just come ashore, leaving herself in thin clothes in the biting cold wind to make phone calls, send coats, and busy herself non-stop. This girl, who grew up in the hometown of hero Cai Yongxiang, was greatly inspired by the heroic deeds and changed her thoughts. She pasted Cai Yongxiang's photo on her diary and wrote: "Cai Yongxiang is 18, and I am already 17. Learn from the hero, age can differ, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot differ by an inch. I will use the spirit of 'seizing the day' to strive to change my worldview..." When she saw her comrades jumping into the water to save people one after another and heard the people on the shore loudly reading "Determine to fight, unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," she was moved to tears and also wanted to go to the ice to save people. But the PLA soldiers maintaining order did not let her go. What to do? Chairman Mao's teachings made her think that one person's ability is big or small, as long as they are selfless and dedicated to the people, they will greatly benefit the people. So, she used her ability to busy herself on the shore.

Countless Red Guard young fighters standing outside the house anxiously cared for their comrades' health. They often stuck their heads in to ask about their comrades' names. This battle had hundreds of participants. They came from Heilongjiang, Jilin, Xinjiang, Hunan, Sichuan, Shanghai, and more than ten provinces and municipalities; they did not know each other, but class brothers' hearts were connected, and Mao Zedong Thought tightly united them.

Everyone wanted to contribute to the rescue work. A 13-year-old young fighter from Inner Mongolia, Han Daixin, was small and couldn't get into the house, running around in frustration. He and a young fighter from Wuhan, Tan Lingling, discussed: "So many people jumped into the water, their clothes are all wet, how will they spend the night tonight?" "Right! We must quickly go back and report." Saying this, the two ran out of the People's Park straight to a certain military academy. To deliver the news a minute earlier, they ran until they were out of breath and covered in sweat. They encouraged each other as they ran: "Determine to fight, unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

The ambulances from Haidian Hospital arrived; the ambulances from a certain PLA hospital arrived; the doctors and relevant personnel from a certain military academy also rushed to the scene with a large number of bedding and medical equipment.

After the rescue, except for a few seriously injured who were sent to the hospital for further treatment, the other comrades were taken by a certain military academy as guests to spend the night and dry their clothes. However, the soldier Guo Wenxing from the "Hero Eighth Company" declined the doctor's advice to stay in the hospital for examination and also declined the invitation from the military academy. He said, "If I don't go back now, I will be overdue." People looked at him with admiration as Li Huizhu and a batch of Red Guards who came with him supported Guo Wenxing to leave, all could not help but praise from the bottom of their hearts: Selfless and dedicated to the people, the soldiers educated by Chairman Mao are indeed tough!

	"Learn from the PLA!"
	"The invincible Mao Zedong Thought long live!"
	"Long live our most beloved leader Chairman Mao!"

Thunderous cheers echoed in the night sky over Kunming Lake.

### 毛主席教导出来的人——记首都昆明湖上一场破冰抢救红卫兵的战斗

    毛主席教导出来的人
    ——记首都昆明湖上一场破冰抢救红卫兵的战斗
    编者按：读了这篇通讯，令人无限兴奋，无限鼓舞。这一感人事例，充分体现了我国革命人民在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的高度革命热情，体现了广大工农兵群众和革命小将们崭新的精神面貌。这是伟大毛泽东思想的又一曲响彻云霄的凯歌。
    一个红卫兵掉进冰窟了，上百个阶级兄弟，争先恐后地投入了英勇的抢救战斗。这件事说明了什么呢？
    它充分说明了，我国人民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，进入了新阶段，出现了新局面。毛泽东思想已被越来越多的人所掌握。毛主席的教导越来越深入人心。毛主席的话已经被广大革命人民印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。
    它充分说明了，我国革命人民在毛泽东思想哺育下，毫不利己专门利人的共产主义精神大大发扬。毛主席的好战士雷锋、王杰、刘英俊、蔡永祥……的英雄形象，活在千万人的心中，激励人们创造更多的英雄业绩。解放军战士和十几个省市的阶级弟兄，奋不顾身地参加了这场惊心动魄的抢救斗争，就是最有力的证明。
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，用伟大的毛泽东思想统一全国人民的思想，我们必将无往而不胜。
    我们伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席第八次接见文化革命大军后的第二天——十一月二十七日，许多外地来京串连的革命师生，怀着无比温暖、无比幸福的心情，来到西郊人民公园（颐和园）参观。隆冬季节的昆明湖，虽然已经封冻，但整个公园里却是一派春意。到处是歌声，到处是欢笑。来自祖国四面八方的革命小将们，兴奋地谈论着接受伟大领袖毛主席检阅时的难忘情景。
    就在这个欢乐的时刻里，一件激动人心的事情发生了。
    毛主席的话就是命令
    下午四时半，在昆明湖十七孔桥西面的南湖岛上，突然传来了一阵惊呼：“救人啦！救人啦！”人们顺着喊声看去，只见南湖岛东北湖面上，离岸一百多米处，一个落水的红卫兵正在冰窟中挣扎，处境非常危急。毛主席关于“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的教导，顿时在多少人的脑子里闪过。人们像接到了命令，从四面八方飞快地奔向出事地点。一个工人同志，三把两把扯去了衣服，从湖东冲到了冰面上；来自四川万县的一个红卫兵，急忙从三米多高的十七孔桥上跳下去；黑龙江依安县一位十四岁的小将，从南湖岛的小山上飞快地跑到岸边，跨过石栏杆，纵身跃进冰湖中……
    一场紧张的战斗展开了。
    冰层吱吱喳喳地响着，随时有裂陷的危险。但是人们顾不得这些，他们有的拿着竹竿，有的推着梯子，向着一个共同的目标前进。
    河深海深，不如阶级友爱深。只要红卫兵战士能脱险，自己的安危又算得什么！吉林来的红卫兵小将田春耘，看到了冰水，想起了自己右腿的关节炎。下？不下？他猛然想起毛主席的教导，一事当前，千万不要先替自己打算啊！于是，他毫不犹豫地投入战斗。
    要奋斗就会有牺牲！干革命就不能怕冒风险！由于湖心冰层薄，上去的人，都相继掉进了冰窟。尖利的冰块，划破了他们的皮肤；刺骨的寒冷，揪紧了他们的心，掐住了他们的喉咙。他们透不过气来，四肢也逐渐麻木了，但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，没有一个畏缩，没有一个后退，他们自己处于困难境地，想的却是别人。听了毛主席的话，天大困难都不怕
    在这支勇敢战斗的队伍中，有一位头戴军帽的大个子青年。他挺立在齐脖深的冰水里，正抡起双拳，向着坚硬的冰层砸去。冰块撕开了他的衣衫，划破了他的手臂和胸膛；可是他却像一艘无坚不摧的破冰船，前进，前进着……。他是北京部队某部“英雄八连”的战士，名叫郭文兴，现在是红卫兵的政治工作员。前一天，他带着一个排的红卫兵接受了毛主席的检阅；这天，又带着小将们到公园来游览。当他听到呼喊，看到落水者的险状时，毛主席的教导，在他耳边回响；罗盛教、蔡永祥等英雄形象，重现在他的眼前。他毫不犹豫地从东岸朝湖心奔去，边跑边脱棉衣，决心豁出一切。可是，当他刚刚朝着落水的人走了二十多米，“咔嚓”一声，自己也掉进了冰窟。寒冷彻骨的冰水，一下子淹到头顶。他浮上水面，定了定神，发现前边的一位工人和几位红卫兵也已落进了冰窟，动弹不得，处境困难。他先把就近的红卫兵救上岸，又用拳头从冰上砸开了十米长的通道，把那位工人救回来。这时，郭文兴已感到四肢不灵，站立不稳。冷风一吹，他浑身痉挛，连迈步都感到十分困难。但是，当他看到西岸的落水者还没有救起，毛主席的话：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”，又在耳旁响起。顿时，他浑身增添了无穷力量，推开了搀扶他的人，穿着湿淋淋的衬衣、短裤，光着脚板跑过十七孔桥，又从桥面投入了战斗。
    与此同时，来自祖国西北地区的空军某部教员朱潼生和胡炳良，也正奋不顾身地抢救着陷入冰窟里的红卫兵。朱潼生对胡炳良说：“红卫兵是毛主席请来的客人，要是他们有个三长两短，我们对不起毛主席！”
    正在冰水中奋力战斗的红卫兵小将们，从解放军同志的英勇行动中，得到了巨大的鼓舞。他们决心跟着解放军在冰上打出一条通道，去接近落水的红卫兵。一拳、两拳，十米、二十米……随着时间的推移，他们的呼吸越来越困难了，许多人身体渐渐地沉下去。
    这时，岸上的红卫兵小将们也争先恐后拥到石栏杆边要往下跳。但是，被几个解放军同志所阻住。战士们告诉他们，岸上的支援工作也很重要。
    竹竿、木板、绳子，通过无数双手，一件件传到冰面上，有力地支援了水中的同志。岸上的小将知道，在水中奋战的战友们，此刻最最需要的是毛泽东思想。他们齐声高呼：
      “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
      “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
          “……”
    这是毛主席的话！这是我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的号召呀！
    岸上、岸下，冰上、水中，人们的心都被这句话牢牢地拧成了一个整体。毛主席呀，毛主席！听您老人家的话，天大的困难我们都不怕！毛主席啊！我一定做您的好战士
    来自黑龙江海林县的红卫兵邢云发，在营救落水者的时候，自己也掉进了冰窟。当他刚从冰层底下，找到窟口冒出水面的时候，忽然眼前红光一闪，他马上觉察到，《毛主席语录》掉在湖里了。他对自己说：“什么都可以丢，毛主席的书不能丢。”他马上捞起了那红光闪闪的宝书，高高举起，他好像又亲眼见到毛主席。前一天，当他接受毛主席检阅的时候，曾怀着对伟大领袖无限热爱的心情，在这本红书的扉页上写道：“伟大领袖毛主席从我身边走过，这是我最大的幸福！”他暗暗地向毛主席宣誓：毛主席啊！我一定永远听您的话，做您的好战士！毛主席鼓舞着他坚持战斗。他踩着水和另一个同志一起去抢救落水的红卫兵。可是由于冰层的不断塌陷，他的几次努力都没有成功，头部被埋进水中，连连几口冰水，把他呛得迷迷糊糊。
    就在这时，邢云发听到岸上响起了“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的呼声，精神陡然一振。他睁眼一看，一个解放军同志正破着冰向他靠拢。他想起了来京串连中和解放军政治工作员一起学习这条语录的情景；想起了前一天晚上解放军同志讲的“十人桥”的故事：淮海战役中，我军的十个同志，冒着枪林弹雨，在河里搭起一座人桥，保证了冲击部队的胜利前进。我一定要像解放军那样，按照毛主席的指示，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。现在是考验我的时候，也是我学习解放军的好机会。他用尽全力，和周围的同志一起，把落水者推上伸过来的梯子，自己则沿着刚打开的冰道，向岸边奋力游去，直到昏迷在水中，被人救上岸去。
    战斗已经持续了一个多小时。落水的人大部都已被救上岸了。这时，用身体冲开一条冰路的郭文兴，已经陷入了半昏迷的状态，可是还在坚持战斗，他背起一个冻僵了的人，又扶起另外两个人，让他们攀在自己身上，一步一步地向岸边移动；嘴里还在背诵着：“不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”——这是他所在的“英雄八连”的战士们经常背诵的一条毛主席语录。许多年来，每当这个连队遇到了困难的时候，他们总是按着英雄连队前辈的榜样，高声朗读这条语录去迎接胜利。从湖岸倒挂下人梯，伸过来几双手，好容易才把郭文兴从堤岸下拉上来。
      “水里还有人吗？”
      “没有了。”
      “我们胜利了！”
      “你们是集体的罗盛教！集体的蔡永祥！”岸上无数的人激动地向他们围拢来。毛泽东思想把我们凝结在一起
    战斗并没有结束。抢救冻伤人员的斗争还在紧张进行。
    当一个个下水者从冰湖里上岸的时候，无数双友爱的手立即递过来一件件棉衣、毛衣、裤子；大家背的背，扶的扶，把他们送到了岛上的南湖饭店。
    南湖饭店挤满了人。饭店工作人员，早已腾出了自己的床铺，生起了火炉。炉火温暖着人们的身体，真挚的阶级感情温暖着人们的心。
    几个红卫兵小将捧着热开水，端着热酒，小心地撬开受冻的战友们的牙齿，给他们灌下去。解放军战士李怀珠把四川来的那个红卫兵，紧紧地抱在自己怀里，解开衣扣，用自己灼热的心窝，温暖着他的胸膛。一位来自湖南的红卫兵，敞开衣襟把战士郭文兴冻僵了的双脚夹在自己热呼呼的腋下。另一些红卫兵则把战友们的手放在自己的面颊上，恨不得把全身的热量，一下子全传导给自己最亲爱的同志。革命小将刘昌惠，在人群中钻来钻去忙碌着。她把大衣脱给了刚上岸的空军教员朱潼生，自己只穿着一身单薄的衣衫在凛冽的寒风中叫电话，送棉衣，忙个不停。这个生长在英雄蔡永祥家乡的小姑娘，在英雄的事迹鼓舞下，思想上起了很大的变化。她把蔡永祥的照片，贴在自己的日记本上，还写下了这样的话：“蔡永祥十八岁，我已经十七岁了。向英雄学习，岁数可以差，毛泽东思想一分一毫也不能差。我要用
  ‘只争朝夕’的精神，努力改造自己的世界观……”当她看见同志们个个奋不顾身下水救人，听到岸上的人高声读着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的时候，激动地含着泪花，也争着要到冰面上去救人。可是，维持秩序的解放军战士不让她去。怎么办？毛主席的教导使她想到，一个人能力有大小，只要毫不利己专门利人，就会大有益于人民。于是，她就尽自己的能力，在岸上忙起来。
    无数站在屋外的红卫兵小将们，焦急地关切着战友们的健康。他们不时探进头来，询问着战友们的名字。这场战斗，有成百人参加了。他们来自黑龙江、吉林、新疆、湖南、四川、上海等十几个省区市，他们都互不相识；但是，阶级兄弟心连心，毛泽东思想把他们紧紧凝结在一起了。最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁
    人人都想为抢救工作贡献自己的力量。来自内蒙古十三岁的小将韩大欣，人小，挤不进屋子，急得团团转。他和武汉来的小将谭玲玲商量起来：“下水的人这么多，他们的衣服全湿了，今天晚上怎么过夜呀？”“对呀！我们赶快回去报信。”说完，他俩就出了人民公园，直向某军事学院跑去。为了早一分钟把消息送到，跑得气喘吁吁，汗流浃背。他俩一边跑，一边互相鼓励：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    海淀医院的救护车来了；解放军某医院的救护车来了；某军事学院的医生和有关人员也带着大批的被褥、医疗器材赶到了。
    经过抢救，除了几个较重的被送进了医院继续治疗外，其余的同志都被某军事学院当作客人接去过夜、洗烤衣服。然而“英雄八连”的战士郭文兴，谢绝了医生叫他住院检查的劝告，也谢绝了某军事学院的邀请。他说：“再不回去就要超假了。”人们以钦佩的眼光，看着李怀珠和一批同来的红卫兵，搀扶着郭文兴离去，都不禁从心底赞叹：毫不利己专门利人，毛主席教导出来的战士就是过得硬！
      “向解放军学习！”
      “战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
      “我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！”
    春雷般的欢呼声，回荡在昆明湖上的夜空。
