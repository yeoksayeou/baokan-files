The U.S. imperialists brazenly bombed the Chinese embassy in Vietnam, which is part of their scheme, in collusion with the Soviet revisionists, to carry out the "bombing to force peace" conspiracy to salvage their failing war in Vietnam. They attempt to test the resolve of the Chinese people to aid Vietnam in its resistance against the U.S. This only exposes the stupidity of the U.S. imperialists and their failure to learn from past lessons.

Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: Our reporter reports that the U.S. imperialist bandit planes have recently been repeatedly bombing and strafing the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and on the afternoon of the 14th, brazenly dive-bombed the Chinese embassy in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The buildings of the Chinese embassy and the Xinhua News Agency's Hanoi branch were seriously damaged. This is another serious war provocation by the U.S. imperialists against the Chinese people and a shameful war crime they have committed against the Chinese people.

The U.S. imperialists' bombing of the Chinese embassy is not an isolated incident. After the U.S. military planes bombed and strafed Chinese fishing boats operating peacefully in the western waters of the Gulf of Tonkin on November 30th and December 1st, and the Chinese Ministry of National Defense issued a serious warning to the U.S. imperialists, in less than half a month, the U.S. imperialists brazenly bombed the Chinese embassy in Vietnam. This is part of their scheme, in collusion with the Soviet revisionists, to carry out the "bombing to force peace" conspiracy to salvage their failing war in Vietnam. It is a deliberate act of war blackmail and war intimidation against the Chinese people. The U.S. imperialists attempt to test the resolve of the Chinese people to support their Vietnamese brothers in their struggle to the end. Such actions only expose the stupidity of the U.S. imperialists and their failure to learn from past lessons.

The U.S. imperialists' new war provocations against the Chinese people fully expose their madness and adventurism, reflecting their continued and developing policy of hostility towards the Chinese people. Recently, while the U.S. ruling clique has been intensifying military provocations against the Chinese people, it has also, with the cooperation of the Soviet revisionists, actively plotted new anti-China conspiracies and issued a large number of anti-China rants. U.S. Secretary of State Rusk visited Taiwan on his way to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting, where he had extensive "exchanges of views" with the military and political leaders of the Chiang bandits, urging the Chiang bandits to "play a greater role" in the U.S. war in Vietnam. Since November, nine high-ranking U.S. military and political officials have gone to Taiwan to engage in conspiratorial activities. U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara recently ranted about the "certain danger" of a war between the U.S. and China, and former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Reischauer advocated that the U.S. should make "every effort" to "contain China." Senator Stennis, chairman of the Senate Preparedness Subcommittee, ranted about the "risks" the U.S. must take in "entanglements" with China. The mouthpiece of the U.S. monopoly capitalist class, the New York Times, even openly advocated in its December 5th editorial to take advantage of the fact that China is in the midst of a cultural revolution to make a grab in Vietnam and realize the great conspiracy of "bombing to force peace."

However, whether the U.S. imperialists play the role of a bandit or a pickpocket, they cannot intimidate or deceive the heroic Vietnamese people and the great Chinese people. If the U.S. imperialists make a wrong assessment of this, they will surely reap what they sow. As the Chinese government stated in its December 15th statement: "Seven hundred million Chinese people will forever be the staunch backers of their Vietnamese brothers. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have long been determined not to fear any sacrifice and to resolutely fight alongside the Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism."

On the afternoon of December 14th, U.S. bandit planes fired missiles at the buildings of the Chinese embassy in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The photo shows the missile remnants.

### 美帝战争挑衅决吓不倒中国人民

    美帝战争挑衅决吓不倒中国人民
    美帝悍然轰炸中国驻越南大使馆，是它为了挽救侵越战争的败局，伙同苏修加紧推行“以炸迫和”阴谋的组成部分，妄图以此试探中国人民援越抗美的决心。这只能说明美帝的愚蠢和没有领够教训。
    新华社十六日讯　本社记者报道，美帝国主义强盗飞机最近接连对越南民主共和国首都河内市进行狂轰滥炸，并且在十四日下午悍然俯冲轰炸中国驻越南民主共和国大使馆，中国使馆和新华社河内分社的建筑遭到严重破坏。这是美帝国主义对中国人民进行的又一次严重战争挑衅，是它对中国人民犯下的无耻的战争罪行。
    美帝国主义对中国大使馆的轰炸，决不是一个偶然的、孤立的事件。在美国军用飞机十一月三十日和十二月一日接连轰炸和扫射在北部湾西部海域进行和平作业的中国渔船，中国国防部发言人就此向美帝国主义提出严重警告之后，不到半个月，美帝国主义又悍然轰炸中国驻越南大使馆，这是它为了挽救侵越战争的败局，伙同苏联修正主义者加紧推行“以炸迫和”阴谋的组成部分，是蓄意对中国人民进行的战争讹诈和战争恫吓。美帝国主义妄图以此试探中国人民支援兄弟的越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底的决心。这种行径，只能说明美帝国主义的愚蠢和没有领够教训。
    美帝国主义对中国人民的新的战争挑衅行动，充分地暴露了它的疯狂性和冒险性，反映了它坚决与中国人民为敌的政策的继续和发展。美国统治集团最近在加紧对中国人民进行军事挑衅的同时，还在苏联修正主义者配合下，积极地策动反华新阴谋，发出大量反华叫嚣。美国国务卿腊斯克在出席北大西洋集团会议途中访问了台湾，同蒋匪帮军、政头目广泛“交换意见”，要蒋匪帮在美国侵越战争中“发挥更大的作用”。自从十一月以来，已有九个美国高级军政头目到台湾进行阴谋活动。美国国防部长麦克纳马拉不久前叫嚷存在着美国同中国“发生战争的某种危险”，美国前驻日大使赖肖尔鼓吹美国要“尽最大的努力”“遏制中国”。参议院战备小组委员会主席斯坦尼斯叫嚣同中国“发生纠葛”是美国“必须冒的风险”。美国垄断资产阶级的喉舌《纽约时报》在十二月五日的社论里甚至公然鼓吹要利用中国正在进行文化大革命的时机在越南捞一把，实现“以炸迫和”的大阴谋。
    但是，不管美帝国主义扮演强盗角色，还是扒手角色，它是既吓不倒也骗不了英雄的越南人民和伟大的中国人民的。美帝国主义对这一点如果作出错误估计，必将自食其果。正如中国政府十五日声明所说的：“七亿中国人民永远是兄弟的越南人民的坚强后盾。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，早就下定决心，不怕任何牺牲，坚决同越南人民一道，彻底打败美帝国主义。”（附图片）
