The masses of Huangshandong began to widely study Chairman Mao's works starting in the spring of 1964. Over the past two years, we have adopted various methods to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, making it deeply rooted in people's hearts and known to every household. One of the most popular and effective methods is to write Chairman Mao's quotations everywhere, inside and outside houses, and throughout the village. This is a method created by the masses themselves for studying and propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

The members of Huangshandong have deeply felt through studying Chairman Mao's works that Chairman Mao's words are all truths, and one sentence is worth ten thousand. With Mao Zedong Thought arming their minds, people become the smartest and bravest. To make a revolution, one cannot be without Mao Zedong Thought for even a moment. Therefore, whether old or young, everyone carries a deep class sentiment and studies Chairman Mao's works word by word, hoping to truly master Mao Zedong Thought. However, the people in this poor mountain valley suffered greatly before liberation, and many have no education, unable to recognize even a single character. Studying Chairman Mao's works mainly relies on memory and asking others at any time. For those with little education, starting with quotations is a good way to study Chairman Mao's works. Writing quotations everywhere allows everyone to study wherever they go. Practice has proven that this method is effective. No matter how long or short a quotation is, it can be quickly memorized through repeated study, asking, and thinking. Now, in our brigade, whether old or young, everyone can recite at least ten quotations. In this way, Mao Zedong Thought takes deeper root in the hearts of the members. Therefore, writing quotations everywhere is a demand of the broad masses of peasants and a good method for studying Chairman Mao's works.

    让社员处处看到毛主席语录
    黄山洞大队　叶华盛
    我们黄山洞的群众，是从一九六四年春天开始广泛地学习毛主席著作的。两年多来，我们采取了多种多样的方式，宣传毛泽东思想，使毛泽东思想不断深入人心，做到家喻户晓。其中最受群众欢迎和行之有效的一种方法，就是在屋里屋外，村里村外，到处写上毛主席语录，这是群众自己创造出来的一种学习和宣传毛泽东思想的有效的方法。
    我们黄山洞的社员群众，通过学习毛主席著作深深体会到，毛主席的话，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。有毛泽东思想武装头脑，人们就会变得最聪明、最勇敢。要革命，就一刻也不能离开毛泽东思想。所以，无论是大人小孩，都带着深厚的阶级感情，如饥似渴地一字一句地学，希望能把毛泽东思想真正学到手。但是，我们这个穷山沟里的人，解放前受苦深，很多人没有文化，斗大的字不识一个，学习毛主席著作主要靠脑子记，靠随时随地问人。我们文化低的人，学习毛主席著作，从学习语录入门是个好办法。到处写上语录，大家就可以走到那里，学到那里。事实证明，这样做的效果很好。一条语录，不论长短，多学、多问、多想很快就记住了。现在我们大队不论大人小孩，都至少能够背诵十条八条语录。就这样，毛泽东思想在社员心中扎下的根就越深了。所以，到处写上语录，是广大农民群众的要求，是学习毛主席著作的好方法。
