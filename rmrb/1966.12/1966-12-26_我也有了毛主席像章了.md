Many Cuban and Latin American friends eagerly hope to obtain a Chairman Mao badge. When Chinese comrades walk on the street or pass through public places with the red and shining Chairman Mao badges pinned to their chests, they often encounter the following situation:

"Ah, Chairman Mao!" One or two foreign friends will stare at the badge on their chest and say.

"Do you have an extra one?" This is the request that follows to the Chinese comrades. The Chinese comrades have no choice but to take the badge off their own chest and give it to these friends who love Chairman Mao.

One day, two Chinese comrades with Chairman Mao badges pinned to their chests were walking on the street. Suddenly, a Cuban approached them and said, "You promised to give me a Chairman Mao badge. Please give it to me now!" He also introduced himself, saying, "I am a worker from a nearby factory." When the Chinese comrades said they did not recognize him, this worker smiled and explained that a few days earlier he had met another Chinese comrade, who had promised to give him a Chairman Mao badge. He said, "It's all the same anyway." So the Chinese comrades generously took off the badge from their chest and gave it to him. He repeatedly expressed his thanks and excitedly said, "I already have a photo of Chairman Mao, and I have long wanted to have a Chairman Mao badge. Now my wish has finally come true."

    我也有了毛主席像章了
    不少古巴朋友和拉丁美洲朋友热切地希望得到一枚毛主席像章。当中国同志胸前别着红光闪闪的毛主席像章在街上行走或经过公共场所时，常常碰到这样的情况：
    “啊，毛主席！”一位或两位外国朋友盯着他胸前别着的毛主席像章说。
      “你有没有多余的一枚？”这是跟着向中国同志提出的要求。中国同志只好把别在自己胸前的像章取下来，赠送给这些热爱毛主席的朋友。
    有一天，两位胸前别着毛主席像章的中国同志走在街上，突然，一位古巴人迎上来说：“你们答应过给我一枚毛主席像章，现在请送给我吧！”他还自我介绍说：“我是这里附近工厂的工人。”当中国同志表示还不认识他时，这位工人笑着解释说，几天以前他遇见过另一位中国同志，是那位中国同志答应过给他一枚毛主席像章的，他说：“反正都是一样。”于是中国同志就慷慨地取下胸前的毛主席像章送给他。他一再表示感谢，并且兴奋地说：“我已经有了一张毛主席的照片，很久就想得到一枚毛主席像章，现在我的愿望终于实现了。”
