	Revolutionary Feelings as Deep as the Sea

	Comrade Zhang Airu, a student at a certain military medical school, was dispatched this time to receive the Red Guards. A few days ago, she received a letter from Dong Yushu, a student from Dan Dong City, which read: “I am so unwilling to part with you! I want so much to be with you forever! In this brief night, my heart is like the waves of the sea, unable to calm down, as if I were leaving a loved one. It is truly hard to part. This night, I could not help but cry, but due to the needs of the revolution, we have to part….”

	Why do the Red Guards love Zhang Airu so much? Because Zhang Airu, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, serves them wholeheartedly. One night, after the Red Guards had fallen asleep, Zhang Airu, who had worked hard all day, also wanted to sleep. At this moment, she thought of Chairman Mao’s teaching: “All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other.” She then rushed to each dormitory, covering the Red Guards who had kicked off their blankets, making the fire in the stove burn brightly. Finding that someone was short of a blanket, she took her own blanket and coat to cover them. For sixteen nights, Zhang Airu slept without a blanket. Her legs had a disease, and once they caught a chill, the disease would act up, causing severe cramps and pain. When she could no longer bear it, she would check the beds and ensure the Red Guards rested well. Due to the cold weather, some Red Guards caught colds, so Zhang Airu bought sugar and ginger with her own money, made ginger sugar water, and served it to them cup by cup. Wei Liping and other students fell ill and were hospitalized, so Zhang Airu went to the hospital to visit them and wrote down Chairman Mao’s words, “Having come, settle down, do not worry about yourself at all,” and sent it to them.

	During the days of receiving the Red Guards, Zhang Airu would get up before dawn every day to clean the more than twenty rooms and corridors on the upper and lower floors spotlessly. Exhausted and frozen, Zhang Airu fell ill with a fever but still insisted on working. Many Red Guards, tears of gratitude in their eyes, urged her to rest, but her reply was: “As long as everyone is healthy, can accept Chairman Mao’s inspection, and can learn revolutionary skills, that’s fine. I don’t matter.” When asked what force drove her to do this, she said, “It is Mao Zedong Thought, it is the ‘Three Articles.’” Zhang Airu insisted on reading the “Three Articles” every night, memorizing them well and applying them effectively. Many revolutionary teachers and students took Zhang Airu as an example and also insisted on reading the “Three Articles” every night. To help everyone study Chairman Mao’s works well, Zhang Airu bought more than twenty copies of the “Three Articles” and gave them to her classmates. When the books were not enough, she used her nighttime to copy the “Three Articles” onto the blackboard for everyone to read. Under her influence, more than a hundred revolutionary teachers and students in the entire platoon could recite “In Memory of Norman Bethune,” and most could use Chairman Mao’s words to guide their actions. Zhang Airu established revolutionary feelings with the revolutionary teachers and students, and many people expressed their desire to learn from her.

    革命感情似海深
    张爱茹同志，是解放军某护士学校的学员，这次被派去接待红卫兵。前几天，她收到丹东市董玉淑同学的一封信，上面写道：“我是多么不愿意和你分别啊！是多么想和你永远在一起啊！在这短暂的一夜里，我的心好像大海的波涛一样不能平静，好像要离开亲人一样，真是难舍难分。这一夜，我禁不住哭了，但由于革命的需要，我们不得不分开啊！……。”
    红卫兵为什么这样热爱张爱茹呢？因为张爱茹按照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，全心全意为他们服务。一天夜里，红卫兵都睡着了，张爱茹劳累了一天，也很想睡。这时，她想起了毛主席的教导：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”便跑向每一个宿舍，给蹬被子的红卫兵盖被子，把炉火升得旺旺的，发现有人缺少被子，便把自己的被子、大衣拿去给他们盖上。有十六个夜晚，张爱茹睡觉都没有盖被子，她的腿原来有病，一受凉，病犯了，老是抽筋，疼得厉害。当她忍受不了的时候，索性查铺，照料红卫兵好好休息。由于天气冷，有的红卫兵感冒了，张爱茹便用自己的钱出去买糖、生姜，熬姜糖水，一碗一碗送给他们喝。魏利苹等同学因病住院了，张爱茹又到医院去探望，还写了毛主席说的“既来之，则安之，自己完全不着急”的语录送给他们。
    在接待红卫兵的日子里，张爱茹每天天还没有亮就起来，把楼上楼下二十多个房间和走廊打扫的干干净净。又累又冻，张爱茹病了，发烧，仍然坚持工作。许多红卫兵眼里含着感激的泪水劝她休息，得到的回答却是：“只要大家身体健康，能接受毛主席的检阅，能学到革命的本领，这就好了，我是不要紧的。”有人问是什么力量使她这样作的，她说：“是毛泽东思想，是‘老三篇’。”张爱茹每天晚上都坚持读“老三篇”，背得熟，用得好。许多革命师生都以张爱茹作榜样，也坚持每天晚上读“老三篇”。为了帮助大家学习好毛主席著作，张爱茹买了二十多本“老三篇”送给同学。书不够，她利用夜晚的时间把“老三篇”抄在黑板上，便于大家读。在她的影响下，全排一百多名革命师生都能背下《为人民服务》，大都能用毛主席的话指导自己的行动。张爱茹与革命师生建立了革命的感情，许多人都表示要向她学习。
