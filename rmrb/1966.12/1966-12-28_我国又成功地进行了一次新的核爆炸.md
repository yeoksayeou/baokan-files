China successfully conducts another nuclear test

This successful nuclear test has elevated China's nuclear weapons technology to a new level.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission extend warm congratulations to the soldiers, workers, engineers, and technical personnel of the People's Liberation Army who participated in the nuclear test, as well as all relevant personnel. They praise them for following Chairman Mao's teachings, setting high aspirations, and, under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fully embodying the spirit of bravery, fearlessness of sacrifice, and continuous combat.

China has successfully conducted three nuclear tests this year. This is a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, a great encouragement to the heroic Vietnamese people and all revolutionary peoples of the world, and a significant contribution to the defense of world peace.

News Bulletin

On December 28, 1966, China successfully conducted another nuclear test in a western region of the country.

Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The history of mankind is a history of continuous development from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. This history will never end. In a society with class existence, class struggle will never end. In a society without class existence, the struggle between new and old, correct and incorrect will never end. In the realm of production struggle and scientific experimentation, mankind is always developing, and nature is always developing, never stopping at one level. Therefore, mankind must always summarize experience, discover, invent, create, and progress."

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the People's Liberation Army, the broad masses of workers, and scientific and technical personnel have set high aspirations and, under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have fully embodied the spirit of bravery, fearlessness of sacrifice, and continuous combat. After the successful test of missile and nuclear weapons, they have successfully completed this new nuclear test, thus elevating China's nuclear weapons technology to a new level. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and another fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission extend warm congratulations to all soldiers, workers, engineers, scientific and technical personnel, and all relevant personnel who have been engaged in the research and testing of nuclear weapons. They hope that in the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they will resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, continue to emphasize proletarian politics, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, take "The Three Articles" as a motto to learn, further promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, and achieve new and greater successes in strengthening China's national defense and accelerating the modernization of national defense.

China has successfully conducted three nuclear tests this year. This is a heavy blow to the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism to collude and attempt to achieve nuclear monopoly, disrupting the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations. It is a great encouragement to the heroic Vietnamese people who are fighting against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and to all revolutionary peoples of the world who are fighting bravely. It is a significant contribution to the defense of world peace.

China conducts necessary and limited nuclear tests and develops nuclear weapons solely for defensive purposes, with the ultimate goal of eliminating nuclear weapons. We once again solemnly declare that under any circumstances, China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons. The Chinese people and the Chinese government, as always, will continue to stand with all peace-loving peoples and countries of the world, firmly and unshakably strive for the lofty goal of a complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.

    新华社十二月二十八日讯　新闻公报
    一九六六年十二月二十八日，中国在本国西部地区，又成功地进行了一次新的核爆炸。
    毛泽东同志说：“人类的历史，就是一个不断地从必然王国向自由王国发展的历史。这个历史永远不会完结。在有阶级存在的社会内，阶级斗争不会完结。在无阶级存在的社会内，新与旧、正确与错误之间的斗争永远不会完结。在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。因此，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”
    中国人民解放军、广大职工和科学技术人员遵循着毛主席的这一教导，树雄心、立壮志，在无产阶级文化大革命的促进下，发扬了勇敢战斗，不怕牺牲，不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，继导弹核武器试验成功之后，又圆满地实现了这次新的核爆炸，从而把我国核武器的科学技术提高到一个新的水平。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕的成果。
    中国共产党中央委员会、国务院和中共中央军事委员会，向从事核武器研制和试验工作的中国人民解放军全体指战员、工人、工程技术人员、科学工作者和一切有关人员，致以热烈的祝贺，希望他们在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，坚决响应林彪同志的号召，继续大力突出无产阶级政治，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新阶段，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，进一步促进人的思想革命化，为加强我国国防力量，加速实现国防现代化，取得新的、更大的成就。
    中国在今年一年内，成功地进行了三次核试验，这对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义相互勾结，妄图实行核垄断，破坏一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族革命斗争的阴谋是一个沉重的打击，对正在进行抗美救国斗争的英雄的越南人民和全世界正在进行英勇斗争的革命人民是一个巨大鼓舞，对保卫世界和平是一个重大贡献。
    中国进行必要而有限制的核试验，发展核武器，完全是为了防御，其最终目的是为了消灭核武器。我们再一次郑重宣布，在任何时候，任何情况下，中国都不会首先使用核武器。中国人民和中国政府，一如既往，将继续同全世界一切爱好和平的人民和国家一道，坚定不移地为全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器的崇高目标而共同奋斗。
