The Asian and African News Workers Association Secretariat issued a statement on December 20, firmly supporting the statement issued by the Asian and African Writers Permanent Bureau on December 17, and strongly condemning the fake "Third Asian and African Writers Conference" preparatory meeting manipulated by Soviet revisionists in Cairo.

The statement pointed out that the fake "Third Conference" preparatory meeting in Cairo is a meeting that openly raises the white flag of further surrender to American imperialism, a meeting that splits and betrays the revolutionary movement of the Asian and African peoples.

The statement expressed that we firmly believe that the statement of the Asian and African Writers Permanent Bureau will help to inspire all revolutionary writers and news workers to further expose the split activities of the Soviet revisionists, expose their collusion with American imperialism, support many countries' reactionary fascist regimes, and betray the revolutionary cause of the Asian, African, and Latin American peoples.

According to a report from New China News Agency in Dar es Salaam, the Tanzania Writers Association announced on December 14 that Tanzania will send a delegation to attend the Third Asian and African Writers Conference to be held in Beijing next year and will contribute to the success of the conference.

The Tanzania Writers Association made this announcement in a joint statement signed with the Asian and African Writers Permanent Bureau delegation here.

The joint statement said: "The Tanzania Writers Association expresses its full cooperation and support for the Asian and African Writers Permanent Bureau, led by Secretary-General S. Nananayak, in its struggle for unity against imperialism."

According to a report from New China News Agency in Baghdad, the Asian and African Writers Permanent Bureau Friendship Delegation, after a six-day visit to Iraq, left Baghdad for Algiers on December 20.

The delegation leader, S. Nananayak, told reporters at the airport that the delegation had exchanged views with Iraqi writers. The Iraqi writers fully agreed with the Permanent Bureau's policy of opposing imperialism and colonialism. He also said that the Iraqi writers expressed that they would send a delegation to attend the Third Asian and African Writers Conference to be held in Beijing next year.

The Asian and African Writers Permanent Bureau Friendship Delegation, led by S. Nananayak, received a warm and enthusiastic welcome from writers and government officials in Iraq. Progressive writers and cultural workers in Iraq expressed their support for the revolutionary line of unity against imperialism and support for people's liberation struggles, as advocated by the Asian and African Writers Permanent Bureau led by S. Nananayak.

After the delegation arrived in Baghdad on December 14, Iraqi President Arif and Minister of Culture and Guidance Duleid Damalugi received the delegation successively.

According to a report from New China News Agency in Damascus, the Syrian newspaper reported on December 9 that the Asian and African Writers Permanent Bureau Friendship Delegation and Syrian writers jointly issued a statement: Syrian writers, intellectuals, and cultural workers resolutely support the decision made at the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers held in Beijing in June this year to hold the Third Asian and African Writers Conference in China in 1967, and will send a delegation to participate in this conference.

The joint statement said that Syrian writers, intellectuals, and cultural workers fully support the Asian and African Writers Permanent Bureau headquartered in Colombo and with its executive secretariat in Beijing, and will cooperate with it.
