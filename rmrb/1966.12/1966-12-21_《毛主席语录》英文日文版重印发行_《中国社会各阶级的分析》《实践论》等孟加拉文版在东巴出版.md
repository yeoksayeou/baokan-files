The English and Japanese editions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" have been widely welcomed by foreign visitors and domestic readers since they were published and supplied by the Foreign Languages Publishing House. To meet the urgent needs of a wide range of domestic foreign language readers, especially teachers and students in foreign language departments of colleges and universities, the Ministry of Culture has recently arranged for the publication and printing of these editions. Using the plates of the Foreign Languages Publishing House, the English and Japanese editions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" will be reprinted in batches and will begin to be distributed to bookstores across the country by the end of this month.

The works of Chairman Mao, "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "On Practice," and "On New Democracy," have recently been translated into Bengali and published in the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka, and have been warmly welcomed by a wide readership.

In the preface to the single-volume Bengali translation of "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," the publisher wrote: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the progress and achievements of China, as well as the stance China has taken, have won the boundless admiration of the people of the world." The publisher stated: "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the mentor of the people of the world, especially the people of Asia and Africa who are striving for liberation." The publisher further noted: The people of Asia and Africa have found help in applying Mao Zedong Thought in their practical struggles.
