On a cold afternoon, the young Red Guards of the "East Is Red Long March Team" arrived at the village of Ershili Pu in Xin County, Shanxi. They saw the villagers busy digging a canal, working with great enthusiasm. The team leader couldn't help but shout, "Comrades, look at the villagers' spirit!" A team member replied, "Let's join them and work together!" This suggestion was immediately approved by everyone. They put their backpacks by the roadside and joined in the canal digging. As the young Red Guards worked, they chanted, "Resolve to fight, unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, strive for victory." This action greatly boosted the villagers' morale, and they completed two days' work in one day. The villagers praised them, saying, "You are truly Chairman Mao's good Red Guards! You are just like the 'Little Eighth Route Army'!" But the young Red Guards replied in unison, "It's nothing; Chairman Mao taught us to do this!"

The next day, while the young Red Guards were still asleep, the landlord, Aunt Wei, brought them water for washing and prepared breakfast. The young Red Guards thanked Aunt Wei, but she smiled and said, "It's nothing; Chairman Mao taught us to do this!"

The young Red Guards bid farewell to Aunt Wei and the villagers, picked up their bags, and set off with their red flags.

When they reached the foot of a mountain, Liu Zuoye suddenly remembered something: "Oh no! I forgot to return the needle I borrowed from Aunt Wei last night to pop my blisters. What should I do?" At this, the other team members also looked worried. The team leader thought for a moment and said, "Comrades, let's open the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' to page 220!" Following this, everyone read in unison the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. When they read the part about "not taking a single needle or thread from the people," their voices suddenly stopped. The young Red Guards' hearts were deeply moved by these eight characters. Liu Zuoye stood up excitedly and said, "I must return the needle to Aunt Wei. We must follow the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention just like the PLA!" With that, he ran off...

Liu ran and ran, his blistered feet aching terribly, but he had only one thought: to quickly return the needle to Aunt Wei. When he finally reached Aunt Wei's door, panting and sweating, Aunt Wei hurried out to meet him, asking, "Child, what did you forget?" Liu Zuoye took out the needle and handed it to Aunt Wei. Aunt Wei looked at the needle in her hand and then at the Red Guard standing before her, tears welling up in her eyes. She patted Liu Zuoye's shoulder and said, "You are truly soldiers without uniforms!"

    一根针
    红文
    在一个寒冷的下午，“东方红长征队”的小将们来到山西忻县二十里铺村北。他们看到社员们正在挖水渠，干得正起劲。队长禁不住喊了起来：“同学们，看社员们的干劲多大！”有一个队员回答道：“咱们也和他们一起干吧！”这个建议立刻得到大家的赞同。他们把背包放在路旁，参加了挖渠。小将们一边干，一边喊：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这种行动大大地鼓舞了社员们的干劲，加快了挖渠的速度。收工了，两天的任务一天完成了，社员们赞扬说：“你们真是毛主席的好红卫兵！真像‘小八路’！”但小将们却异口同声地回答：“没什么，这是毛主席教导我们这样做的！”
    第二天，小将们还在睡梦中，房东魏老大娘就端来了洗脸水，做好了饭。小将们感谢老大娘，可大娘也笑着说：“我们也没什么，这也是毛主席教导我们这样做的！”
    小将们告辞了老大娘和社员们，又背起行装，举着红旗出发了。
    当他们走到一个山脚下时，刘作业同学忽然想起了一件事：“糟了！晚上挑血泡用的大娘的针，忘了还给她，怎么办呢？”这时同学们也都为难起来。队长思忖了一下说：“同学们，我们翻开《毛主席语录》二百二十页！”接着，大家合着一个节拍朗读三大纪律、八项注意，当读到“不拿群众一针一线”一段时，声音突然停住了。小将们的心都被这八个字吸住了。这时，刘作业激动地站了起来说：“我得给大娘把针送回去，我们要像解放军那样遵守三大纪律、八项注意！”说完就拔腿跑了……
    小刘跑呀跑，脚上的血泡痛得钻心，但他只有一个心思，尽快地把针送到老大娘手里。当他满头大汗地跑进大娘的门口，大娘急忙迎了出来，说：“孩子，丢下了什么？”刘作业把针拿出来递给了大娘。大娘看看手里的针，又看看站在自己面前的红卫兵，激动得掉下泪来，她拍着刘作业的肩膀说：“你们真是不穿军装的解放军哪！”
