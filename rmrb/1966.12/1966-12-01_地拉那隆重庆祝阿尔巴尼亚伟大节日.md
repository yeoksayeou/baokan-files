More than a thousand people from various sectors of Tirana gathered at the Tirana Cultural Palace on November 28 to celebrate the 54th anniversary of Albanian national independence and the 22nd anniversary of Albania's liberation.

Present at the celebration were: Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly Haxhi Lleshi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Adil Çarçani, Vice Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly Musa Përmeti, members of the Central Committee of the Party and ministers of various government departments, leaders of various mass organizations, and senior military officers of the People's Army.

Çarçani delivered a speech at the meeting.

In his speech, he discussed the significance of Albania's independence in 1912 and the great achievements of Albania's socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past 22 years since liberation. He said that the people of our country have been united like steel in the flames of class struggle and creative labor around the Party. The Party's very important measures for the further revolutionization of national life and the deepening of the socialist revolution have created the conditions for our people to successfully fulfill the grand program of the Fifth Congress of the Party.

When discussing the current tasks of the Albanian people in implementing the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party and executing the Fourth Five-Year Plan, Çarçani said that the Party's battle slogans must be deeply ingrained in the minds of everyone. The Party's battle slogans are: "Promote proletarian politics," "Continuously wage class struggle," "Rely firmly on the masses," "Consistently implement the Marxist-Leninist principle of self-reliance," "Produce more, better, and more economically," and "Build socialism with one hand holding a pickaxe and the other holding a gun."

When discussing the current international situation, Çarçani said that the Soviet revisionists continue to pursue a traitorous policy of being pro-American, flattering America, and surrendering to America, undermining the revolutionary and national liberation struggles of the peoples of various countries. The Soviet revisionist leaders and American imperialism have formed a "holy alliance" in the political, economic, ideological, and cultural spheres. Under these circumstances, the peoples of various countries must strengthen their revolutionary vigilance and intensify the struggle against imperialism and revisionism on both fronts.

Çarçani said that the Khrushchev revisionists, on the one hand, shout loudly about their aid to Vietnam, but on the other hand, they support the American plan to force the Vietnamese people to engage in "peace talks" and accept the conditions of surrender to the aggressors. In this regard, the Khrushchev revisionists are plotting new conspiracies and making new deals with the imperialists.

Çarçani pointed out that American imperialism, with the full support of modern revisionism, especially Soviet revisionism, is directing the spearhead of its global strategy towards the great socialist power, the People's Republic of China, which stands at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle. The great people of China today are an insurmountable obstacle to the American imperialists and modern revisionists in their plan to dominate the world. Therefore, they are doing everything in their power to contain, encircle, and obstruct the development and progress of the people of China. However, the imperialists and their revisionist accomplices have gained nothing from their joint anti-China conspiracy. In the face of the invincible power of 700 million Chinese people, their plans have already failed and will forever fail. The 700 million Chinese people are united as one around the glorious Communist Party of China and the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, and are engaged in an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. China is undergoing tremendous and profound revolutionary changes. The main purpose of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to further revolutionize all work and life in the country and to block all channels for the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism.

Çarçani warmly praised the revolutionary friendship and fighting unity between the peoples of Albania and China. He said that Chairman Mao's congratulatory message to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party on the high evaluation of the Albanian Party and people made the Albanian people excited, proud, and inspired.

Çarçani finally called on the Albanian people to redouble their efforts to successfully carry out the great tasks of the Fourth Five-Year Plan and to implement the thoughts and resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party.

Çarçani's speech was repeatedly interrupted by cheers for the "Party," "Enver Hoxha," and "Enver-Mao."

The delegation of the Chinese Science and Technology Group led by Chen Weiji and the delegation of Chinese journalists led by Chai Yuren, as well as representatives of Chinese technicians helping Albania in its construction, were invited to attend the celebration.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 29: The Central Committee of the Party, the Presidium of the People's Assembly, and the Council of Ministers of Albania held a grand banquet on November 28 to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of Albania's liberation. People's Assembly Chairman Haxhi Lleshi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Adil Çarçani, Vice Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly Musa Përmeti, ministers of various government departments, leaders of various mass organizations and the People's Army, as well as representatives of workers, peasants, soldiers, and the scientific and cultural circles attended the banquet.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 29: Albanian party and government leaders celebrated with the people of various regions the two great national holidays of Albania: the 54th anniversary of Albanian national independence (November 28) and the 22nd anniversary of Albania's liberation (November 29).

The beloved leader of the Albanian people, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party Enver Hoxha, celebrated the holiday with the people of Gjirokastër. Hoxha visited the Gjirokastër Small Metal Factory on November 28, visited some families of martyrs, and had cordial conversations with them. On the same day, Hoxha also visited the National Liberation Struggle Museum in Gjirokastër and was warmly welcomed by the residents near the museum. In the evening, Hoxha attended a celebration evening organized by the Gjirokastër District Party Committee, the Executive Committee of the District People's Assembly, and the Democratic Front.

Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mehmet Shehu celebrated the holiday with the people of the famous hero city of Fier on November 28. Shehu also visited the families of some martyrs and patriots and attended a celebration evening organized by the Fier District Party Committee and the Executive Committee of the District People's Assembly.

Other Albanian party and government leaders such as Kadri Hazbiu, Manush Myftiu, Ramiz Alia, and Koli Trovë also celebrated the independence day and liberation day with the people of Fier, Përmet, Korçë, and Elbasan, respectively.

    高举马列主义革命红旗　把反帝反修斗争进行到底
    地拉那隆重庆祝阿尔巴尼亚伟大节日
    霍查同志等党政领导人分赴各地同人民欢度独立节和解放日
    据新华社地拉那二十九日电　地拉那各界人士一千多人二十八日在地拉那文化宫隆重集会，热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚民族独立五十四周年和阿尔巴尼亚解放二十二周年。
    出席庆祝会的有：阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席列希，劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席查尔查尼，人民议会主席团副主席佩扎，党中央委员和政府各部部长，各群众团体负责人和人民军高级干部等。
    查尔查尼在会上讲话。
    他在讲话中谈到了阿尔巴尼亚一九一二年独立的意义和解放后二十二年来阿尔巴尼亚社会主义革命和社会主义建设的巨大成就。他说，我国人民在阶级斗争和创造性劳动的烈火中钢铁般地团结在劳动党的周围。党为了国家生活的进一步革命化和社会主义革命的深入开展所采取的十分重要的措施，为我国人民胜利完成劳动党第五次代表大会制订的宏伟纲领创造了条件。
    查尔查尼在谈到当前阿尔巴尼亚全国人民贯彻劳动党第五次代表大会决议和执行第四个五年计划的任务时说，必须使党的战斗口号深入到每个人的思想意识中去。党的这些战斗口号是：“突出无产阶级政治”、“不断开展阶级斗争”、“有力地依靠群众”、“始终不渝地实行自力更生的马克思列宁主义原则”、“更多、更好、更省地进行生产建设”、“一手拿镐、一手拿枪地建设社会主义”。
    查尔查尼在谈到当前的国际形势时说，苏联修正主义者继续奉行亲美、媚美和降美的叛徒政策，破坏各国人民的革命和民族解放斗争。苏联修正主义领导人和美帝国主义结成了政治、经济、思想和文化等各方面的“神圣同盟”。在这种情况下，各国人民必须加强革命警惕性，必须加强反对帝国主义和反对修正主义这两条战线的斗争。
    查尔查尼说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者一方面大叫大嚷说他们援助越南，但是另一方面，他们支持美国的计划，企图强迫越南人民同侵略者进行“和谈”，接受向侵略者投降的条件。在这方面，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者正在策划新的阴谋，同帝国主义者进行新的交易。
    查尔查尼指出，美帝国主义在现代修正主义，首先是在苏联修正主义领导人的全面支持下，把全球战略的矛头指向了伟大的社会主义强国、站在反帝斗争最前线的中华人民共和国。伟大的人民中国今天是美帝国主义者和现代修正主义者实现其主宰世界计划的不可逾越的障碍。因此，他们千方百计地遏制、包围人民中国，阻挡它的发展和进步。但是，帝国主义者及其帮凶修正主义者没有从他们的联合反华阴谋中捞到任何东西。在七亿中国人民的不可战胜的力量面前，他们的计划已经遭到，并必将永远遭到可耻的破产。七亿中国人民像一个人一样团结在光荣的中国共产党和伟大领袖毛泽东同志的周围，投入了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，中国正在发生巨大的和深刻的革命变化。无产阶级文化大革命的主要目的就是实现国家一切工作和生活的进一步革命化，堵塞产生修正主义和资本主义复辟的所有渠道。
    查尔查尼热情赞扬了阿中两国人民的革命友谊和战斗团结。他说，毛泽东主席在致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电中，对阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民的崇高评价使阿尔巴尼亚人民感到兴奋、骄傲和鼓舞。
    查尔查尼最后号召阿尔巴尼亚全国人民加倍努力，为胜利地执行第四个五年计划的伟大任务和贯彻劳动党第五次代表大会的思想和决议而奋斗。
    查尔查尼的讲话不断为“劳动党”、“恩维尔·霍查”和“恩维尔—毛泽东”等欢呼声所打断。
    由陈维稷率领的中国科学技术代表团和由柴与人率领的中国新闻工作者代表团全体成员，以及帮助阿尔巴尼亚进行建设的中国技术人员代表应邀出席了庆祝会。
    据新华社地拉那二十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央、人民议会主席团、部长会议，二十八日晚举行盛大宴会，热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放二十二周年。阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席哈奇·列希，劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席阿迪尔·查尔查尼，人民议会主席团副主席穆斯林·佩扎，政府各部部长，各群众团体和人民军的负责人以及工人、农民、战士、科学文化界的代表出席了宴会。
