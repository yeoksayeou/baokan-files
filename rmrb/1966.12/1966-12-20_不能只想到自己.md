	Do Not Think Only of Yourself
	Hou Yulan, Fangxiang Production Brigade

	Last spring, before the New Year, there was a lot of rain and snow, and the vegetables in the market gradually became scarce. Some people wanted to take advantage of this to raise prices. Some commune members said, "This is good, now our vegetables can be sold at a higher price!" At that time, I did not say anything.

	When I returned home for a meal, I opened "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read while eating. When I saw the sentence "Everything should be done for the interests of the people, and not for the interests of a small group or an individual," I thought of what I had heard earlier and felt something was wrong. The income of the production team is a small matter, but adhering to the socialist direction is a big matter. We poor and lower-middle peasants must not undermine the foundations of socialism. Thinking of this, I put down my chopsticks and hurried out to convene a meeting of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association committee members. At the meeting, Kong Lanying said, "In the old society, after the 24th day of the twelfth lunar month, even yellow soil would be worth three more cents. The poor people suffered a lot, often carrying two and a half piculs, and had to borrow money at high interest to buy New Year's goods. At that time, we suffered a lot. Now, by studying Chairman Mao's works, we poor and lower-middle peasants should not do this." Finally, the five committee members unanimously agreed not to sell at high prices.

	The next day, we sold the vegetables at market prices. After selling for a day, some children of landlords and rich peasants stirred up trouble among the crowd, saying, "If Hou Yulan is in charge, she will ruin the family. She doesn't want the money that is right in front of her. We should settle accounts with her!" I thought that most of the poor and lower-middle peasants would support me as they are determined to follow the socialist path. That evening, I convened a commune members' meeting. At the beginning, some people opposed me, while others supported me. I said, "Increasing income and improving living standards should be achieved through improving collective production, not by raising prices. Increasing production is increasing everyone's income. Why rely on selling at high prices?" The debate was intense, and most people supported me. At this point, I read two passages from "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to everyone: "Everything should be done for the interests of the people, and not for the interests of a small group or an individual," and "Serve the people wholeheartedly." After reading, I asked everyone, "Is selling at high prices for the interests of the people, or for the interests of a small group? Is it serving the people wholeheartedly, or serving oneself at the expense of others?" These short sentences immediately enlightened everyone. They said, "We study Chairman Mao's works to follow Chairman Mao's instructions. Selling at high prices is the capitalist road, and we cannot take this path. Increasing income must be achieved through developing collective production and following the socialist path."

    不能只想到自己
    方巷大队　侯玉兰
    去年春节前，雨雪过多，集市上的蔬菜渐渐少起来，有些人就想乘机抬高价格。有的社员说：“这下好了，我们的菜也可以卖高价啦！”当时，我听了没出声。
    回家吃饭，我翻开《毛主席语录》，边吃边看。当看到“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”这一句时，又想起刚才听到的事，觉得不对头。生产队收入多少是小事，坚持社会主义方向是大事，我们贫下中农万万不能挖社会主义的墙脚。想到这里，我就放下饭碗，匆匆忙忙跑出去，召集贫协委员开会。会上孔兰英说：“旧社会，过了腊月二十四，黄土也要贵三分，穷人吃得苦，常背二斗五，要办年货只好借高利贷。那时候，我们吃够了苦。现在学习毛主席著作，我们贫下中农不能这样做。”最后五个委员一致同意，不卖高价。
    第二天，我们按市场价格卖菜。卖了一天，有些地富子女在群众中挑拨说：“要侯玉兰当家，把家当都冲了。眼看到手的钱，她都不要。找她算账！”我想，大多数贫下中农是坚持走社会主义道路的，他们会支持我。当晚召开社员大会，开始你一句，他一句，有反对我的，也有支持我的。我说：“增加收入，改善生活，要靠搞好集体生产，不能靠抬高价格。提高了产量不就是增加大家的收入，为什么要靠卖高价？”大家辩论得很激烈，大多数人是支持我的。这时，我给大家读了两段毛主席语录：“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”，“毫不利己专门利人。”读完以后，我问大家：卖高价是从人民利益出发，还是从小集团利益出发？是毫不利己专门利人，还是毫不利人专门利己呢？这么短短的两句话，把大家的心立刻拨亮了。他们说：我们学习毛主席著作，就要听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。卖高价是走的资本主义道路，这条路我们不能走。增加收入一定要靠发展集体生产，走社会主义的道路。
