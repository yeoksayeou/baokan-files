    Power comes from the barrel of a gun. This is a great truth drawn from the historical experience of the Chinese and world revolutions by our great leader Chairman Mao.

    This great truth points the way for the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Across the vast lands of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the flames of armed struggle are burning fiercely everywhere. Imperialism and all reactionaries are trembling with fear in the face of the people's guns, anxiously awaiting their own doom.

    Modern revisionists are the running dogs of imperialism and are equally terrified of the people's guns. Therefore, they frantically attack the truth that "power comes from the barrel of a gun," claiming that it has become "outdated." They insist that the peoples of various countries believe that "the nature of imperialism and reactionaries has changed" and that they have become "reasonable."

    Will the nature of imperialism and reactionaries change? Will they step down voluntarily if the people do not take up arms to fight? No, this is sheer nonsense!

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful." Countless ironclad facts tell us: imperialism and reactionaries will never "become reasonable" and voluntarily exit the historical stage. Against enemies who wield guns, the people must take up guns to fight, to defeat them in battle or to replace them. Why did Chiang Kai-shek, who launched a full-scale civil war in 1946, flee from the Chinese mainland with his tail between his legs in 1949? Why did the arrogant Japanese devils, who thought they were invincible, surrender unconditionally in 1945? Why did the American imperialists, who bragged about "swimming in the Yalu River and grazing horses on Mount Baekdu," sign the armistice agreement at Panmunjom? All these things happened not because their nature changed, but because the revolutionary people fought them with guns.

    The revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are increasingly understanding this truth through their actual struggles. A guerrilla fighter from Angola said it well: "Once we pick up our weapons, we will never put them down, because we know: 'Power comes from the barrel of a gun.'"

    Let the modern revisionists scream and curse in front of this great truth! The wise judgment that "power comes from the barrel of a gun" will increasingly win the hearts of the people. Under the guidance of this truth, the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America will continue to develop and achieve greater victories!

### 枪杆子里面出政权

    枪杆子里面出政权
    “枪杆子里面出政权”。这是我们伟大领袖毛主席从中国革命和世界革命的历史经验中总结出来的一个颠扑不破的伟大真理。
    这个伟大的真理，向亚、非、拉广大革命人民指明了革命的道路。在亚、非、拉广大的土地上，到处燃起了武装斗争的熊熊烈火。帝国主义和一切反动派，在人民的枪杆子面前，吓得心惊胆寒，正为自己的末日将到而惶惶不安。
    现代修正主义者是帝国主义的帮凶，也对人民的枪杆子怕得要死。因此，他们拚命攻击“枪杆子里面出政权”这个真理已经“过时”了。他们硬要各国革命人民相信，“帝国主义和反动派的本性变了”，已经变得“通情达理”了。
    帝国主义和反动派的本性会改变吗？人民不拿起枪杆子进行斗争，它们就会自动让步吗？不，这是彻头彻尾的骗人的鬼话！
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”无数铁的事实告诉我们：帝国主义和反动派是决不可能“通情达理”而自动退出历史舞台的。对于拿着枪杆子的敌人，人民只有拿起枪杆子进行斗争，才能战而胜之或取而代之。在一九四六年疯狂地发动内战的蒋介石，为什么在一九四九年夹着尾巴逃出了中国大陆呢？气焰嚣张，不可一世的日本鬼子，为什么在一九四五年无条件投降了呢？疯狂叫嚷要“到鸭绿江游泳、长白山放马”的美帝国主义，为什么在板门店停战协定上签字了呢？所有这一切，决不是因为他们的本性有什么改变，而都是革命人民用枪杆子打出来的。
    亚非拉革命人民从实际斗争中，越来越懂得了这个真理。安哥拉一位游击战士说得好：“我们一拿起武器，就决不会放下，因为我们知道：‘枪杆子里面出政权’。”
    让现代修正主义者在这个伟大的真理面前声嘶力竭地去咒骂吧！“枪杆子里面出政权”这个英明的论断必将越来越深入人心。在这个真理的指引下，亚非拉人民的革命斗争必将不断发展，取得越来越大的胜利！　解放军某部　王炳文
