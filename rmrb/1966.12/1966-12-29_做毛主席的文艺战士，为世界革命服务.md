Chairman Mao said: “Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people.” Through our own practice, we have gained an even deeper understanding of this truth.

Since this summer, our Chinese Folk Dance Troupe has visited and performed in eight Asian and African countries. In more than half a year of performances, we have deeply felt that Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful weapon for the revolutionary people of the world, and the revolutionary people of the world need revolutionary art guided by Mao Zedong Thought. Only by propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the people of various countries can we truly serve the world revolution.

Among our performance pieces, there are many that reflect the revolutionary storms of the Asian and African peoples and praise the anti-imperialist struggles of the world’s people. These pieces have been warmly welcomed by audiences in various countries. Whenever we perform the dance “Fighting Africa,” African audiences cannot help but shout “Woo! Woo!” They say, “This dance expresses the feelings of the African people.” When we perform pieces reflecting the Vietnamese people’s struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, the entire audience often enthusiastically shouts slogans like “Down with American imperialism!” “Yankees, get out of Vietnam!” turning the performance into a grand anti-American demonstration. We deeply feel that only art that is closely connected with the struggles of revolutionary people can produce such great power. Some foreign friends meaningfully told us, “In the past, when you performed ‘Lotus Dance,’ people would just watch and that would be it. But this time, your fighting songs and dances have strengthened people’s resolve, shown them the future and hope. This is the art of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism combined.”

The awakened fighting spirit of the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa has also deeply inspired us and enriched our performances. Seeing the Palestinian people’s determination to fight against the Israeli invaders, who are supported by American imperialism, and to recover their homeland, we quickly choreographed the dance “We Will Definitely Return to Our Homeland.” When performing for Palestinian refugees, almost every audience member was moved to tears. They said, “This is the first foreign art troupe to perform a piece about the struggle of the Palestinian people.” Several Palestinian friends even jumped onto the stage, waving red copies of “Quotations from Chairman Mao,” shouting, “Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!” “Long live China-Palestine friendship!” The entire audience also enthusiastically shouted, “We will definitely return to our homeland and rebuild it!”

During our performances, we always remember Chairman Mao’s teaching: “Our literature and art are for the people, first of all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for them and used by them.” Therefore, we often go to the countryside, factories, and streets abroad to perform for the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and residents. Many audience members are deeply moved by our actions. An elderly woman from Yemen said, “You are the best people in the world. I hope you will stay forever.”

The reason our overseas performances have been so warmly welcomed by the people of various countries is that we have adhered to Chairman Mao’s principles of revolutionary art and propagated Mao Zedong Thought. We have seen with our own eyes that the great leader Chairman Mao enjoys extremely high prestige among the revolutionary people of the world. No matter where we perform, as soon as we mention the name of the great leader Chairman Mao, the shouts of “Long live Mao Zedong!” immediately resonate like thunder across the entire venue. The singing, applause, and cheers from the stage and the audience blend into a vast, surging sea of joy. The people of the whole world love Chairman Mao so much. We, as artists who live by Chairman Mao’s side, should hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and better serve the people of China and the people of the whole world.

    做毛主席的文艺战士，为世界革命服务
    毛主席说：“革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。”我们通过自己的实践，更加深切地认识了这个真理。
    今年夏天以来，我们中国民间歌舞团到八个亚非国家访问演出。在半年多的演出中，我们深深感到：毛泽东思想是世界革命人民最有力的武器，世界革命人民需要毛泽东思想指导下的革命文艺。只有向各国人民宣传毛泽东思想，才是真正为世界革命服务。
    我们演出的节目中，有很多是反映亚非人民革命风暴、歌颂世界人民反帝斗争的。这些节目，受到了各国观众的热烈欢迎。在我们每次演出舞蹈《战斗的非洲》时，非洲观众情不自禁地发出“噜！噜！”的欢呼声。他们说：“这个舞蹈表达了非洲人民的心意。”我们演出反映越南人民抗美救国斗争的节目的时候，往往引起全场观众激昂地高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”“美国佬从越南滚出去！”的口号，使演出成为一次反美大示威。我们深深体会到，只有同革命人民斗争息息相通的文艺才能产生这样巨大的力量。有些外国朋友意味深长地对我们说：“你们过去演出的《荷花舞》，人们看了也就完了。但是你们这次演出的战斗的歌舞，使人们增强了斗志，看到了前途和希望。这是革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的艺术。”
    已经觉醒了的亚非人民革命的战斗精神，也深深地激励了我们，丰富了我们的演出。我们看到巴勒斯坦人民决心同受到美帝国主义支持的以色列侵略者进行斗争、收复自己家园的坚定意志，就很快编排了《我们一定要重返家园》的舞蹈。当向巴勒斯坦流亡者演出的时候，几乎没有一个观众不激动得流下了热泪。他们说：“这是第一个外国艺术团演出巴勒斯坦人民斗争的节目。”几位巴勒斯坦朋友还跳上舞台，手里挥舞着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“中国巴勒斯坦友谊万岁！”全场观众也齐声热烈高呼：“我们一定要打回老家去，重建家园！”
    我们在演出中，牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”因此，我们在国外经常下乡、下厂、上街头，为广大工人、农民、战士和居民演出。许多观众对我们这种行动十分感动。一位也门农民老大娘说：“你们是世界上最好的人，希望你们永远留下来。”
    我们这次出国演出，所以受到各国人民的热烈欢迎，正是因为我们坚持了毛主席的革命文艺方针，宣传了毛泽东思想。我们亲眼看到，伟大领袖毛主席在世界革命人民中享有极其崇高的威望。不管在什么国家什么地方演出，只要我们一提到伟大领袖毛主席的名字，“毛泽东万岁！”的欢呼声，立即像春雷一样震撼全场。台上、台下的歌声、掌声、欢呼声汇成一片欢腾的海洋。全世界人民这样热爱毛主席，我们这些生活在毛主席身边的文艺战士，应该更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地为中国人民和全世界人民服务。
