A two-week-long exhibition of photographs from China's Dazhai Production Brigade of Dazhai Commune recently concluded in Conakry, the capital of Guinea. More than 20,000 Guinean viewers enthusiastically welcomed the exhibition.

Guinea's President Sekou Toure visited the exhibition twice. Ismail Toure, Minister of Economic Development, also led all the officials from the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Rural Economy to visit the exhibition. Several ordinary yet moving stories from the exhibition showed the deep love and respect that the Guinean people have for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and for Mao Zedong Thought.

In the exhibition hall, a large color portrait of Chairman Mao became the focal point of the audience. One day, two Guinean youth stood for a long time, gazing at the portrait, repeatedly saying, "Chairman Mao! You are well!" They told a Chinese staff member who approached them, "Our home is in the border region of Macenta. The Chinese experts sent by Chairman Mao helped us establish the first tea plantation and the first tea factory in Guinea. The Chinese experts also brought the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people to Guinea. For this, we are infinitely grateful to the great leader Chairman Mao. One of our purposes in visiting the Chinese exhibition is to pay our respects to our dear Chairman Mao."

After the exhibition opened, large crowds of viewers came to the exhibition hall every day to copy the quotations from Chairman Mao hanging there. One day, as a Guinean student was copying these quotations word by word, someone asked if he liked to read Chairman Mao's works. He replied firmly, "I love to read them very much. Revolutionary people of all countries need Mao Zedong Thought just as living organisms need sunlight."

During his visit, a Guinean worker pointed to two quotations from Chairman Mao hanging in the exhibition hall and said, "Chairman Mao's words are all truths. If we act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, we can truly grasp our own destiny."

One day, a 14-year-old middle school student, Abdoulaye, after reading all the quotations from Chairman Mao in the exhibition hall, asked a Chinese staff member for Chairman Mao's works. When the Chinese comrade gave him the copy of "The Direction of the Youth Movement" by Chairman Mao that he was reading, Abdoulaye jumped for joy and said, "Chairman Mao's words point us in the right direction. I will always read Chairman Mao's books."

Every day, many Guinean friends wrote in the guestbook, praising the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. Once, a Guinean viewer came to the exhibition early in the morning and copied a four-and-a-half-page reflection he had written at home into the guestbook. He told a Chinese comrade, "This is to better express my love for the great leader Chairman Mao and to tell him what is in my heart." A viewer wrote passionately in the guestbook, "Chairman Mao is not only the greatest leader of the Chinese people but also the greatest revolutionary teacher of the world's people, because Chairman Mao points out the correct path for them to struggle for liberation."

Many viewers saw the great achievements made by the people of Dazhai, China, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and they enthusiastically praised the Dazhai spirit, hailing the victory of the Dazhai people as the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. A viewer wrote in the guestbook: The Dazhai Brigade photo exhibition brilliantly proves that "a country's people, relying on self-reliance and actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, can climb peaks that people think are unclimbable." He also wrote, "The world's revolutionary people, armed with the universal truths of Mao Zedong Thought, can, like the people of Dazhai making mountains bow their heads, dare to struggle and dare to win, and defeat imperialism led by the United States and all its running dogs."

A Guinean employee said after visiting the exhibition, "The farmers of Dazhai have set a brilliant example for us Guineans. They have inspired us, and we are determined to take the road of self-reliance to build an independent national economy, to frustrate the economic blackmail of U.S. imperialism."

    生物需要阳光　革命人民需要毛泽东思想
    ——几内亚人民热情赞颂大寨精神
    为期两周的中国大寨公社大寨生产大队图片展览会最近在几内亚首都科纳克里闭幕，受到了两万多名几内亚观众十分热烈的欢迎。
    几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔两次参观展览会。经济发展部长伊斯梅尔·杜尔也带领几内亚经济发展部和农村经济部的全体干部前往参观。从展览会上发生的几个平凡而又激动人心的故事中，可以看到广大的几内亚人民对中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席和毛泽东思想的无比热爱和敬仰。
    在展览大厅里，毛主席的巨幅彩色画像成了观众关注的中心。一天，有两位几内亚青年学生久久地仰望着这幅画像，连续地说了几声：“毛主席啊！您好！”他们向迎面走来的中国工作人员说：“我们的家住在边境地区的马森塔。毛主席派来的中国专家在那里帮助我们建立了几内亚第一个茶园和第一座茶叶工厂。中国专家还把中国人民的革命精神带到了几内亚。为此，我们无限感激伟大的领袖毛主席。我们参观中国展览会的目的之一，就是向我们亲爱的毛主席致敬。”
    展览会开幕后，每天都有大批观众到展览厅抄写悬挂着的毛主席语录。一天，当一个几内亚学生逐字逐句抄写这些语录时，有人问他是否爱读毛主席著作，他斩钉截铁地说：“我非常爱读”，“各国革命人民需要毛泽东思想就像生物需要阳光一样”。
    一位几内亚工人在参观时，指着展览厅里挂着的两段毛主席语录说：“毛主席的话句句都是真理，我们按照毛主席的教导办事，就能真正地掌握自己的命运。”
    有一天，一位十四岁的中学生阿卜杜拉耶看了展览厅里所有的毛主席语录后，向一位中国工作人员索要毛主席著作。当中国同志把他自己正在阅读的毛主席著作《青年运动的方向》送给他时，他高兴得跳了起来，并说：“毛主席的话向我们指出了正确的方向。我要永远读毛主席的书。”
    每天，都有许多几内亚朋友在留言簿上写下盛赞中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的话语。有一次，一位几内亚观众在清晨来到展览会，把他在家里已写好的长达四页半的感想誊写到留言簿上。他对一位中国同志说：“这是为了更好地表达我对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱，向他讲出自己的心里话。”一位观众热情洋溢地在留言簿上写道：“毛主席不仅是中国人民最伟大的领袖，而且也是世界人民最伟大的革命导师，因为毛主席向他们指出了争取解放的正确道路。”
    许多观众看到了中国大寨人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下所取得的巨大成就时，热烈赞扬大寨精神，称颂大寨人民的胜利是毛泽东思想的胜利。一位观众在留言簿上写道：大寨大队图片展览光辉地证明了，“一个国家的人民依靠自力更生和活学活用毛泽东思想，就能够攀登人们认为无法攀登的高峰。”他还写道：“用毛泽东思想的普遍真理武装起来的世界革命人民能够像大寨人叫高山低头一样，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，战胜以美国为首的帝国主义及其所有的走狗。”
    一位几内亚职员在参观展览以后说：“大寨农民为我们几内亚人民树立了光辉的榜样。他们鼓舞了我们，我们决心走自力更生建设独立的国民经济的道路，以挫败美帝国主义的经济讹诈。”　新华社记者（附图片）
