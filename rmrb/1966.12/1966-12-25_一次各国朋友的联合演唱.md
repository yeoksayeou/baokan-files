Once, in the waiting hall of the capital airport, passengers from all over the world were waiting for their flights. The performing troupe from the Civil Aviation Administration of China sang "The East is Red" and "The Ship Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman at the Helm" for everyone.

At this moment, the hall buzzed with excitement. The foreign guests sang "The East is Red" in different languages, and some clapped along with the rhythm.

This performance actually turned into a joint singing event by friends from various countries.

When the performance ended and the hall quieted down, a German friend turned on his tape recorder and played back the singing that had just been recorded. The hall once again echoed with joyful songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao.

    一次各国朋友的联合演唱
    有一次，在首都机场候机大厅里，来自世界各地的旅客正在等候飞机。中国民航局同志组成的演出队向大家齐唱《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》。
    这时，大厅里沸腾了起来。外宾们用不同的语言跟着唱《东方红》，有的随着节拍不停拍手。
    这次演唱，实际上成了一次各国朋友的联合演唱。
    当演出完毕，大厅里恢复平静的时候，一位西德朋友又打开录音机，把刚才录下的演唱又放送出来，大厅里又响起一片欢腾的歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌声。
