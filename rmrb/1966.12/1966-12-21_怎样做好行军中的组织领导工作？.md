Dear Red Guards and dear revolutionary youngsters! Before discussing the organization and leadership of a march, let us first study a passage from Chairman Mao's teachings.

Chairman Mao said: "...if there is only the enthusiasm of the masses and no strong leading cadre to properly organize the enthusiasm of the masses, then the enthusiasm of the masses will neither be sustained nor will it move in the correct direction or reach a higher level."

From Chairman Mao's teachings, we can see that to do a good job in any work, in addition to mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses, organization and leadership are also very important. This is true for doing other work, and it is also true for conducting a march. To ensure that the troops do not collapse or fall apart in any situation, in addition to strong political and ideological work, meticulous organizational leadership is also required. Only in this way can cadres and soldiers maintain high political enthusiasm, walk well, rest well, and avoid becoming sick, thus maintaining continuous marching and combat capabilities.

In the army, there is a saying: "The exemplary actions of cadres are silent commands." The key to organizing and leading a march is for cadres to set an example and take the lead. On the arduous march, cadres must have deep proletarian feelings for the soldiers, caring for and cherishing them at every turn, enduring hardships first and resting later. With a strong political and ideological foundation, combined with the exemplary actions of cadres, the enthusiasm of the soldiers can be maximized, and the marching and combat tasks can be successfully completed. In the past, during the revolutionary war, the marching and combat tasks of the troops were very frequent. At that time, cadres at all levels of the company understood deeply that only by fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the soldiers and cherishing their strength could they ensure good marching and good combat. During the march, they cared for and cherished the soldiers in every possible way. Many company and platoon cadres competed to carry the guns and backpacks of weak and sick soldiers. Upon reaching the camp, the platoon and company leaders, despite their own fatigue, would boil hot water for the soldiers to soak their feet. Some even personally helped the soldiers with their foot blisters. Once, a platoon of a certain unit of the PLA, after a long march, stayed in a house without doors or windows. At that time, the northwest wind was howling, and it was very cold. The platoon leader let the soldiers sleep inside and slept at the door to shield them from the cold wind. The next day, the soldiers woke up to find a layer of frost on the platoon leader's quilt. Everyone was deeply moved, and each soldier's heart was warm. Another example is the Fifth Company of a certain unit of the PLA stationed in Shenyang. During the severe cold of the third lunar month, the company underwent several days and nights of rapid marching training. By the time they reached the camp, it was already deep into the night. The soldiers were extremely tired and fell asleep as soon as they lay down. At this time, the company's cadres, fearing that the soldiers might catch a cold, personally went to the kitchen to fetch buckets of hot soup, gently woke the soldiers, and had them drink the soup before going back to sleep. Such moving examples are numerous in the PLA. The exemplary actions of the cadres and their high sense of class camaraderie had a tremendous impact on the soldiers. The soldiers said, "If the cadres can endure hardships with us, what difficulties can we not overcome?"

The organizational leadership of a march is a very meticulous task. During the march, cadres must consider and plan for every detail, big or small. In the past, during wartime, because the troops almost marched every day, many company cadres accumulated rich experience in organizing marches. They considered every small detail of the march very carefully. Before the troops set out, they carefully checked the soldiers' uniforms, whether the backpacks were packed properly, whether the items were too many or too few, and whether the shoes fit well. During the march, whenever the troops became crowded or fell behind, they paid attention to maintaining a normal marching speed, avoiding the troops from running and stopping, and preventing excessive consumption of the soldiers' strength. When the troops camped, the cadres went deep into the platoons and companies, supervising the soldiers to wash their faces, soak their feet, and treat foot blisters. At night, they took turns checking the beds and sentries, tucking in the mosquito nets and covering the soldiers with blankets. These may seem like small matters, but if neglected, they can easily cause the troops to decrease in number, affecting the successful completion of the marching task.

During the march, several tasks must be well organized. (1) To do a good job in setting up the camp. The camp setup personnel (i.e., the advance party) are usually led by cadres, with a few soldiers and cooks, setting out in advance. Their main tasks are to mark the route according to the marching line, set up water supply points, and prepare lunch for the troops at major rest points. They also contact local party and government organizations and people's communes to investigate the social situation and customs around the camp. They divide the camping area and air-raid positions, prepare meals in advance, boil water, and prepare foot-soaking water, so that the troops can quickly rest upon arrival. (2) To do a good job in receiving stragglers. Before the march, the company organizes a reception team consisting of a political cadre, a medic, and soldiers, following the troops to receive stragglers, encouraging them to catch up, and helping them carry their guns and backpacks; for the sick, timely treatment should be provided. (3) To manage the food well. According to the changes in climate and the consumption of the troops' strength, appropriately improve and adjust the living conditions. For example, in cold weather, make some spicy soup; in hot weather, make some mung bean soup or other refreshing drinks. (4) To organize rest and health prevention work well. During the march, large and small rest periods should be organized in a planned manner to tidy up the uniforms, pour out the sand in the shoes, drink boiled water, and restore strength. When camping, sentries should be dispatched to prevent sabotage by class enemies. Regularly study the health and disease prevention situation during the march, and conduct relevant health and disease prevention education for all personnel, such as not drinking raw water, not eating unwashed fruits, and not buying snacks indiscriminately. Upon reaching the camp, cadres and medical personnel should go deep into the platoons and companies to comfort and treat the sick.

### 怎样做好行军中的组织领导工作？

    怎样做好行军中的组织领导工作？
    亲爱的红卫兵战士们，亲爱的革命小将们！在谈行军的组织领导以前，我们先来学一段毛主席语录。
    毛主席说：“……如果只有广大群众的积极性，而无有力的领导骨干去恰当地组织群众的积极性，则群众积极性既不可能持久，也不可能走向正确的方向和提到高级的程度。”
    从毛主席的教导中，我们可以看到，要做好任何一项工作，除了发动群众，依靠群众，充分地调动群众的积极性以外，组织领导也是很重要的。做好其他工作是这样，搞好行军也是这样。要保证部队在任何情况下，都走不垮，拖不烂，除了强有力的政治思想工作以外，还要有周密、细致的组织领导工作。这样，才能使干部战士始终保持饱满的政治热情，同时又能走好，睡好，休息好，不出病号，保持持续的行军作战能力。
    在军队中流传着这样一句话：“干部的模范行动，就是无声的命令。”行军的组织领导工作，最重要的是，干部要以身作则，起模范带头作用。在艰苦的行军路上，干部对战士要有深厚的无产阶级感情，处处关心和爱护战士，要吃苦在前，休息在后。有了坚强的政治思想工作，再加上干部的模范带头作用，就能最大限度地调动战士的积极性，圆满地完成行军和作战任务。过去，在革命战争时期，部队的行军和作战任务十分频繁。那时连队的各级干部都深深懂得，只有充分调动战士的积极性，爱惜战士的体力，才能保证行好军，打好仗。在行军中，他们对战士的关心和爱护是无微不至的。许多连排干部，争着替体弱和有病的战士扛枪、背背包。到了宿营地，班长排长们又不顾自己的疲劳，烧好热水，给战士们烫脚。有的还亲自替战士挑脚泡。有一次，解放军某部的一个排，经过长途行军以后，住在一间没有门窗的屋子里。当时，西北风呼呼地吹着，天气很冷。这个排的排长，就让战士们睡在里面，自己睡在门口，替战士挡着风寒。第二天，战士们起来一看，排长的被子上落了一层白霜。大家很受感动，每个人的心里都热呼呼的。还有一个例子，驻沈阳地区解放军某部五连，正当严寒的三九天进行野营训练。这个连队经过几天几夜的急行军，到达宿营地时，已是深更半夜。战士们走得非常疲劳，倒在铺上就睡了。这时，连里的干部怕战士受凉，就亲自到伙房里打来一桶桶辣汤，轻声地把战士们叫起来，喝了辣汤再睡。这样的感人事例，在解放军部队里是很多的。干部的模范作用和高度的阶级友爱精神，在战士身上，产生了巨大的力量。战士们说：“干部都这样和我们同甘共苦，我们还有什么困难不能克服的呢！”
    行军中的组织领导工作，是一项非常细致的工作。行军中无论大事小事，干部都要想到，都要进行周密的组织和计划。过去打仗的时候，由于部队几乎天天走路，许多连队干部都积累了丰富的组织行军的经验。行军中的每一个细小问题都考虑得十分周到。部队出发前，他们都仔细检查战士的着装，看看战士的背包打得合适不合适？带的东西多还是少？鞋子跟脚不跟脚？行军中每当部队拥挤或拉下距离时，就注意掌握正常的行军速度，不使部队时跑时停，避免过分消耗战士的体力。部队宿营时，干部就深入班排，督促战士洗脸烫脚，治疗脚泡。夜间轮流查铺、查哨，给战士掖蚊帐、盖被子。乍看起来这都是些小事情，可是稍一疏忽，就容易造成部队减员，影响行军任务的圆满完成。
    行军途中，有几项工作必须组织好。（一）要做好设营工作。设营人员（即打前站人员）一般要由干部带领，配备一部分战士和炊事人员，提前出发。主要任务是按照行军路线标路标，设立开水供应点和在大休息点上为部队准备午饭。和地方党政机关、人民公社取得联系，调查宿营地周围的社会情况和民情风俗。划分宿营地区和防空位置，提前做好饭，烧好开水、洗脚水，使部队到达后能很快得到休息。（二）做好收容工作。行军出发之前，连队组织收容队，由一名政治干部和卫生员、战士组成，尾随部队，负责掉队人员的收容工作，鼓励掉队人员赶队，帮助他们背枪和背背包；对有病的同志要进行及时治疗。（三）搞好伙食管理。根据气候变化和部队体力消耗情况，适当改善和调剂生活。比如天气寒冷，可做些胡辣汤；天气炎热，可做些绿豆汤或其它清凉饮料。（四）组织好休息和卫生防病工作。在行军途中，应当有计划地组织大、小休息，以便整理着装，倒掉鞋里的砂子，喝开水，恢复体力。宿营时，要派出警戒，严防阶级敌人的破坏活动。要经常研究行军中卫生防病的情况，向全体人员进行有关行军的卫生防病教育，如不喝生水，不吃不洁的瓜果，不乱买零食等。每到宿营地，干部和卫生人员要深入班排，对病号给予安慰和及时进行治疗。
