Chairman Mao teaches us: "Among all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any human miracle can be created." The fact that our factory, which has very primitive equipment, has successfully trial-produced several new products, powerfully proves this truth.

The workers in our factory, under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have the spirit of daring to think, speak, and act. They used very primitive methods to extract a chemical raw material urgently needed for the development of synthetic fibers—zinc sulfate—from sludge and waste.

When we started the experiment, we encountered many difficulties and went through many twists and turns. Faced with difficulties, we organized the workers to study the "Three Articles." We also invited old cadres who participated in the Long March to tell stories of how the Red Army overcame difficulties and won victories by crossing snow-capped mountains and grasslands. The workers, after listening, were greatly inspired and determined to overcome all difficulties and successfully complete the experiment. They said: "The old Red Army soldiers who participated in the Long March created a path where there was none. Now, we will also create our own path in recycling zinc." The workers, lacking chemical knowledge, went to chemical factories to observe and learn. Without equipment, they used small coal ball furnaces and basins to conduct experiments. After countless failures, they finally succeeded in extracting zinc sulfate.

The product was made, but it did not meet the national quality standards. In large factories, there are complete sets of equipment such as electric drying boxes and regulators, but we have none. What should we do? We rely on everyone to find solutions. Initially, we used the method of placing zinc sulfate in the sun to dry, achieving a first-grade product standard. Later, the workers used a homemade heating device, increasing the annual production from the initial tens of tons to eight hundred tons.

The workers were full of vigor and high morale, with a spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress. They continued their efforts and extracted a high-grade paint base material—copper powder—from waste mud.

According to technical records, copper powder must be produced using electrolytic copper, requiring a complete set of equipment such as electrolytic diaphragms, anti-corrosion, and anti-poisoning. We, however, had waste as raw materials and very poor equipment. Could this treasure be extracted from the waste? Everyone faced a pile of black mud, with no equipment or data, raising a series of questions: Could we produce such high-grade copper powder? Could we meet the quality standards for high-grade paint? Could we jump when we just learned to walk? But revisionism was blocking us in this area. We studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Chinese people have the spirit and ability to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." We realized that whether we leap forward or crawl in construction depends not on material conditions but on people, on their spiritual outlook. Everyone said: "The Daqing people could build a large oil field under the sky and on the grassland. We must also be able to trial-produce the copper powder that revisionism is blocking us from this pile of black mud. We rely neither on heaven nor on earth; we rely on Mao Zedong Thought and the spirit of the proletariat."

In the trial production of copper powder, there was an incident where nitrogen dioxide burned the workers' skin and clothes. However, everyone was undaunted. We understood that our experimental work is a struggle, and struggle will encounter difficulties and sacrifices. To achieve success, the only way is to make a firm decision, fear no sacrifice, rely on the wisdom of the masses, and practice again and again.

After several months of experimentation, copper powder was produced. But the quantity was small, the quality was poor, the particle size was large, and the cost was high. Then, some people spread pessimism, saying things like: "To produce high-grade raw materials from a pile of black mud is like a toad dreaming of eating swan meat." Some advised us not to continue, saying, "If this pile of black mud has such potential, why don't many large factories, engineers, and experts go for it?" But the workers were not discouraged. In the most difficult times, they turned to Chairman Mao again. Chairman Mao said: "Our comrades should see achievements and light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." Chairman Mao's teachings made everyone stronger and more clear-headed. Copper powder had been produced from nothing, although the quantity and quality were poor, it proved that extracting copper powder from waste mud was completely possible. We should see the achievements. Everyone said: "Mao Zedong Thought cannot replace scientific experiments, but it can guide us to conduct scientific experiments. As long as the direction is correct, we must not give up halfway."

In the practice of scientific experiments, we found that the production of copper powder, since using iron shavings to replace imported zinc sheets as a replacement agent, the quality had significantly decreased. What should we do? Someone suggested returning to the old method of using zinc as a replacement agent. We immediately thought of Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said: "The growth of any new thing is bound to be tortuous. In socialist construction, if we want to avoid difficulties and hardships and achieve success easily, this is just an illusion." Using iron shavings as a replacement agent is a new thing. In the absence of experience, we should not abandon it because of difficulties and shortcomings; otherwise, we will stifle the growth of new things. The road is created by people walking on it. Using iron shavings as a replacement agent not only significantly reduces costs but also saves a large amount of zinc materials. Thus, after dozens of failures, we finally, with the help of all the comrades in the factory, explored a set of efficient and economical processes. Foreigners did not believe that high-grade raw materials could be produced from waste mud containing copper. We, workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, responded with facts.

Through the successful trial production of two new products, we deeply feel that in doing revolution, not a single minute can be spent without Mao Zedong Thought. As long as we truly master Mao Zedong Thought, we can overcome any "foreign framework," "authority," and "expert." With people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, any human miracle can be created.

    人间奇迹从哪里来？
    国营上海有色冶炼厂　陈鑫煜
    毛主席教导我们说：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”我们这样一个设备非常简陋的工厂试制成功几项新产品的事实，有力地证明了这一真理。
    我厂的工人们，在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，“敢”字当头，发挥了敢想、敢说、敢闯的革命精神，用非常简陋的土办法，从垃圾泥浆里提炼出了发展人造纤维急需的化工原料——硫酸锌。
    我们在开始试验的时候，碰到许多困难，经过很多曲折。在困难面前，我们组织工人们学习“老三篇”。还请参加过二万五千里长征的老干部来讲当年红军爬雪山、过草地，战胜困难、夺取胜利的故事。工人们听了，大长革命志气，决心克服一切困难，搞好试验。他们说：“过去参加长征的老红军，山里没有路，就走出一条路来。现在我们回收锌，也要闯出自己的路来。”工人们没有化工知识，就到化工厂去参观、学习。没有设备，就用小煤球炉、面盆等进行试验，经过无数次的失败，终于将硫酸锌提炼成功了。
    产品是搞成了，但是不能符合国家的质量要求。在大工厂里，有电烘箱、调节器等一整套设备，而我们这里什么设备也没有。怎么办？靠大家想办法。起初，用把硫酸锌放在太阳下晒的办法，使硫酸锌的质量达到一级品的标准。后来，工人们又用土办法搞了一个热烘设备，使年产量从开始几十吨增加到八百吨。
    工人们意气风发，斗志昂扬，以自力更生、奋发图强的精神，再接再厉，从下脚泥巴（就是做过硫酸锌的废料）中提炼出高级油漆的基础原料——紫铜粉。
    根据技术资料记载，紫铜粉必须用电解铜生产，要有整套的电解隔膜、防腐、防毒等庞大设备。我们呢？原料就是垃圾，设备也很差。紫铜粉这个宝是不是能够从垃圾中提炼出来呢？大家面对着一堆黑溜溜的泥巴，一无设备，二无资料，提出一系列的问题：能生产出这样高级的紫铜粉吗？能达到高级油漆的质量要求吗？刚刚学会走，能跳吗？但是，修正主义正在这方面卡我们。我们学习了毛主席的教导：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”认识到在建设上是跳跃，还是爬行，决定的不是物质，而是人，是人的精神面貌。大家说：“大庆人能在头顶青天，脚踏草地的情况下，建成大油田。我们一定也能在这堆黑溜溜的泥巴中试制出修正主义卡我们的紫铜粉。我们一不靠天，二不靠地，我们靠的是毛泽东思想，靠的是无产阶级的志气。”
    在提炼紫铜粉的试验中，曾经发生二氧化氮烧焦工人们的皮肤和衣服的事故。但是大家毫不畏缩。大家懂得我们的试验工作就是斗争，斗争就会遇到困难，就会有牺牲。要得到成功，唯一的途径，就是下定决心，不怕牺牲，依靠群众的智慧，实践再实践。
    经过几个月的试验，紫铜粉试制出来了。但数量少，质量差，粒度大，成本高。于是有人吹起了冷空气，说什么：“要想从一堆黑泥巴中生产高级原料，简直是癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉。”有的劝我们不要搞下去了，说什么“如果这堆黑泥巴中有这种潜力，为什么好多大工厂，工程师、专家不去搞呢？”但是工人们决不灰心，在最困难的时候，又请教毛主席。毛主席说：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”毛主席的教导使大家坚强起来，头脑也更清醒了。紫铜粉已经从无到有制造出来，虽然数量质量差些，但是证明从下脚泥巴中提炼紫铜粉是完全可能的，我们应该看到成绩。大家说：“毛泽东思想不能代替科学试验，但是可以指导我们进行科学试验。只要方向对头，决不能半途而废。”
    在科学试验的实践中，我们发现紫铜粉的生产，自从使用铁刨花代替进口锌片作置换剂后，质量大幅度下降。怎么办呢？有人提出仍回到用锌作置换剂的老路上去，我们马上想到毛主席的教导，毛主席说：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。在社会主义事业中，要想不经过艰难曲折，不付出极大努力，总是一帆风顺，容易得到成功，这种想法，只是幻想。”用铁刨花作置换剂，既然是一个新生事物，在缺少经验的情况下，不应该因为有曲折、有缺点而放弃它，否则就会扼杀新生事物的成长。路是人走出来的，我们采用铁刨花作置换剂，不单能大幅度降低成本，并且可以节约大量锌材。这样，经过了几十次的失败，最后终于在全厂同志的帮助下，摸索出一套多快好省的工艺。外国人不相信用含有铜的下脚泥巴能生产高级原料，我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人以事实作了响亮的回答。
    通过两次新产品的试制成功，我们深深体会到，干革命，一分钟也不能离开毛泽东思想。只要我们真正把毛泽东思想学到手，什么“洋框框”、“权威”、“专家”都可以压倒。有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，什么人间奇迹都能创造出来。
