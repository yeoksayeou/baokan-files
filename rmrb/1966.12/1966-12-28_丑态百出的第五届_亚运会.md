The so-called "Asian Games Federation" controlled by imperialist elements and the fifth "Asian Games" held by the Thai reactionary authorities from December 9 to 20 in Bangkok were full of ugly incidents. The competition was marked by deceit and fighting, with frequent deaths and injuries, and the organization was chaotic, resulting in a mess throughout the competition process.

Participants included some notorious puppet regimes controlled by U.S. imperialism—South Korea, South Vietnam, Israel, and the "Malaysia" authorities—who sent their sports delegations. The Kuomintang bandits, who have long been despised by the Chinese people, were also invited to participate in this Asian Games.

Basketball Turned into Boxing

In the basketball semifinal between Thai and South Korean athletes on the evening of December 17, a South Korean athlete slapped a Thai athlete over a disputed rebound with only four minutes left in the game. The Thai athlete retaliated with a punch, and the two sides engaged in a "breathtaking battle," with "boxing" replacing "basketball." The South Korean boxing referee immediately joined the fight, knocking down the Filipino referee on the court. Thai police and "spectators" also joined in the beating.

The result of this "riotous" match was that four South Koreans "went to the doctor for treatment due to injuries and bruises"; "one athlete had two front teeth knocked out"; another athlete's left hand was injured, "requiring several stitches"; and a tooth of the South Korean sports team's leader was also knocked out. The football field was filled with gunpowder.

Thai newspapers reported that a football match between Japan and Iran was "full of gunpowder," making spectators "tremble with fear."

The report said that in the first half, an Iranian player was injured and left the field after being collided with by a Japanese player. The Japanese goalkeeper fainted on the ground, but the referee turned a blind eye. The Japanese team started to jeer, so the referee ruled that the Iranian team had committed a foul. The Iranian team did not accept it, and two players left the field to "protest." Soon, another Japanese player fell to the ground. In the second half, the gunpowder smell became even stronger. Reuters reported that the second half of the match "turned into a brutal brawl, with several players falling to the ground, groaning in pain."

At the end of this match, the Thai referee who officiated the match, the Thai police who maintained order, and some Thai "spectators" all joined in the beating of the Iranian players. At this moment, the field instantly turned into a battlefield, and order was lost.

Such Champions and Runners-up

In this "Games," many delegations used all means possible to win medals, engaging in deceit and fully exposing the true face of Western sports.

In the men's 4,800-meter cycling race, a Thai athlete, to prevent others from overtaking, used his handlebar to block, causing the following athlete to fall. Other athletes then rushed forward and fell one after another. This Thai athlete thus "won" the championship. Many delegations protested against this.

The Thai authorities responsible for organizing this "Asian Games" falsified the competition schedule to grab more medals. In the women's singles badminton final, a strange phenomenon occurred: the Thai athlete who qualified for the final lost with a score of 0-11 and 4-11, but she easily won the runner-up position.

Spectators Killed and Injured

According to Western news agencies, in a football match between Thailand and Burma, the "price" spectators paid to watch was one dead and more than ten injured.

The report said that before the match started, the order of spectators entering the stadium was very chaotic. A Thai air force sergeant was trampled to the ground. The chaotic crowd trampled over his body. Ten minutes later, his body was dragged out from under the spectators' feet. At this time, he had already been trampled to death.

In this match, described by Reuters as "almost a riot by Thai spectators," "a girl's spine was also broken, and at least ten spectators were injured." During the match, a railing of a stand suddenly broke, and many spectators fell from a height of ten feet to the field below.

### 丑态百出的第五届“亚运会”

    丑态百出的第五届“亚运会”
    据新华社二十七日讯曼谷消息：帝国主义分子操纵的所谓“亚运会联合会”主持的、由泰国反动当局主办的第五届“亚洲运动会”，十二月九日到二十日在曼谷举行。这次“运动会”丑态百出，比赛场上尔虞我诈，大打出手，死人伤人事件层出不穷，组织工作乱七八糟，整个比赛过程呈现一片混乱。
    参加这个“运动会”的包括一些由美帝国主义控制的臭名昭著的傀儡政权——南朝鲜、南越、以色列、“马来西亚”当局派出的体育代表团。早已被中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石匪帮也被邀请参加了这届“亚运会”。
    篮球赛变成拳击赛
    泰国选手和南朝鲜选手十二月十七日晚进行的篮球半决赛，在比赛进行到只剩四分钟时，南朝鲜一个运动员和泰国运动员为一个篮板球发生了激烈的争执。南朝鲜运动员打了泰国运动员一个耳光。泰国运动员就回敬一拳。双方展开了“精彩的战斗”，“拳击”代替了“篮球赛”。南朝鲜的拳击裁判立即进场“参战”，把这场篮球赛的菲律宾裁判打倒在球场上。泰国警察和“观众”也加入了殴打。
    这场“暴动”式的比赛的结果是：有四名南朝鲜人“由于受伤和青肿到医生那里去治疗”；“一个运动员的两个门牙被揍掉了”；还有一个运动员的左手被打伤，“需要缝好几针”；南朝鲜体育队的负责人的一颗牙也被打掉了。足球场上充满火药味
    泰国报纸报道，日本对伊朗的一场足球赛的过程“充满火药味”，看得观众“心惊肉跳”。
    报道说，上半场一名伊朗球员被日本球员撞伤离场，日本队的守门员昏倒在地，裁判视而不见。日本队起哄，于是裁判判伊朗队犯规，伊朗队不服，两名球员离场“抗议”。不久又有一名日本队员倒地不起。下半场，火药味更加浓了，路透社说，下半场比赛“变成了粗暴的混战，有好几名球员跌倒在地上，痛苦地哼叫”。
    在这场比赛终场时，担任这场比赛的泰国裁判、维持秩序的泰国警察，还有一些泰国“观众”，纷纷参加围殴伊朗队员。这时球场顿时变成战场，秩序大乱。
      如此冠亚军
    在这次“运动会”中，许多代表团为了夺取奖牌，使出了他们所能使出的一切手段，尔虞我诈，充分暴露了西方世界的体育真貌。
    在男子四千八百米自行车比赛中，泰国一位选手为了不让别人超越，横过车把去阻拦，后面的选手摔倒了，其他运动员跟着冲上来，也一个接一个摔倒了。这位泰国选手就这样“荣获”冠军。许多代表团为此提出了抗议。
    负责组织这次“亚运会”的泰国当局，为了捞取更多的奖牌，在编排比赛程序时弄虚作假。在羽毛球女子单打决赛中，竟出现了这样的怪现象：获得决赛权的泰国选手却以○比十一和四比十一的悬殊比分败阵，但她却轻而易举的获得亚军。
    观众有死有伤
    据西方通讯社报道，在泰国对缅甸的一场足球赛中，观众所付出的观看“代价”，就是死一人，伤十几人。
    报道说，比赛开始前，观众入场秩序十分混乱。一名泰国空军军士被挤倒在地。混乱的人群纷纷从他的身上踩过去。十分钟以后，他的身体才被从观众脚下拖出来。这时他已被踩死了。
    在这场被路透社称做“泰国观众差不多像是暴动的比赛”中，“一位姑娘的脊梁也被踩断，至少还有十名观众受伤”。比赛进行中，一个看台的栏杆突然又断了，不少观众从十英尺的高处跌到下面的场子里。
