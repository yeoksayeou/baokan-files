The brave soldiers of the Liberation Army of South Vietnam have, over the past two days, deeply penetrated the enemy's heartland, launching fierce attacks on the New Mountain Airport in the suburbs of Saigon and the American military headquarters and barracks within the city. This has dealt a severe blow to the American aggressors. The great victory of the Liberation Army of South Vietnam in the South, coupled with the victory of the military and people of North Vietnam in shooting down more than ten American planes, is truly heartening.

The American imperialists attempted to use the new war adventure of bombing Hanoi to force the Vietnamese people to accept their "bombing for peace" plot. The people of North and South Vietnam have, through their brave battles, taught the American aggressors a lesson: the so-called "air superiority" of the United States is nothing but a paper tiger, with nothing to be afraid of. American planes can not only be shot down from the sky but can also be smashed while parked in heavily guarded airports. American bandits not only face being killed or captured on the spot when committing atrocities but also cannot escape punishment even when hiding in their lairs in Saigon. This is the power of people's war!

Chairman Mao said, "In the history of mankind, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will always make a final struggle against the revolutionary forces." The American imperialists, in their desperation, are bombing Hanoi, which is a sign of their despair. The war adventures of the American aggressors can only make the Vietnamese people more united, with a common hatred for the enemy, and fight the just struggle of anti-American national salvation to the end.

    狠狠地惩罚侵略者
    英勇的越南南方解放军接连两天深入敌人心脏地区，猛烈袭击西贡市郊新山一机场和市内美军机关、宿舍，给了美国侵略者狠狠的惩罚。越南南方解放军这个巨大的胜利，同越南北方军民击落美机十多架的胜利遥相辉映，真是大快人心。
    美帝国主义妄想用轰炸河内的新的战争冒险，来迫使越南人民接受它的“停炸诱和”的阴谋。越南北方和南方的人民，同时用英勇的战斗教训了美国侵略者：美国的所谓“空中优势”不过是纸老虎，没有什么了不起。美国的飞机不但可以从空中打下来，就是停在警戒森严的飞机场上也一样可以砸碎。美国强盗不但行凶时要被当场打死或者活捉，就是呆在西贡的巢穴里也难逃应有的惩罚。这就是人民战争的威力！
    毛主席说，“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。美帝国主义狗急跳墙，滥炸河内，正是一种绝望的挣扎。美国侵略者的战争冒险，只能使越南人民更加万众一心，同仇敌忾，把抗美救国的正义斗争进行到底。
