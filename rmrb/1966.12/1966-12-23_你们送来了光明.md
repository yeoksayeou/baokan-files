The Lao-China Friendship School recently published a Lao-language edition of "Selected Works of Chairman Mao," which has been warmly welcomed by various schools, organizations, and people in the Khammouane region.

The Chairman of the Lao National Civil Servants Union, Vong La, after receiving the "Selected Works of Chairman Mao" from the Friendship School, said: "Chairman Mao's works have profound thoughts and are easy to understand because they are written for workers and peasants." A doctor at the Khammouane Hospital, upon receiving the "Selected Works of Chairman Mao" from the students of the Friendship School, happily said: "You brought us light."

The principal of Khammouane Middle School, after receiving the "Selected Works of Chairman Mao," said: "We deeply feel that when faced with difficulties, only Mao Zedong Thought can solve them. When encountering American imperialism and all reactionaries, only Mao Zedong Thought can defeat them." "Navigating the vast seas requires a helmsman, and revolution requires Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao is our great helmsman." "Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest and most correct revolutionary theory. Without Mao Zedong Thought, we can accomplish nothing."

The Lao-language edition of "Selected Works of Chairman Mao" published by the Friendship School includes eight articles: "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Combat Liberalism," "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," "Problems of War and Strategy," "Reform Our Study," and "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China."
