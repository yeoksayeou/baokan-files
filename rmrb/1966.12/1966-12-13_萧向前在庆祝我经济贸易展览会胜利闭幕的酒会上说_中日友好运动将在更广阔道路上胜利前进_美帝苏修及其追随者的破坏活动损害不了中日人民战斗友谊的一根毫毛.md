Nagoya, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Xiao Xiangqian, head of the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition Team, held a grand banquet on the evening of Dec. 11 to celebrate the successful closing of the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition in Nagoya City. More than 2,500 friends from all walks of life across Japan were invited to attend the banquet. The banquet fully demonstrated the boundless love and respect of the peoples of China and Japan for Chairman Mao, and embodied the combat friendship forged in their common struggle.

At the banquet, Team Leader Xiao Xiangqian said that the success of the exhibition was the result of the resolute struggle of the peoples of China and Japan against all saboteurs. He said, "We have overcome the sabotage and disruption from American imperialism and various reactionaries, Soviet modern revisionism and its various followers; through our joint efforts, we have launched a new high tide of Sino-Japanese friendship. This is a victory for the peoples of China and Japan, and a victory for Mao Zedong Thought."

Xiao Xiangqian said, "The China-Japan friendship movement is an irresistible historical tide. Anyone who tries to sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship will definitely be isolated. Those who claim to be 'friendly' but actually oppose Sino-Japanese friendship, who have vigorously sabotaged the exhibition and viciously attacked the true friends of the Chinese people, have become accomplices of the right-wing elements. However, they cannot harm the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Japan in the slightest. He said, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people will forever be good friends of the Japanese people. The China-Japan friendship movement will advance victoriously on a broader path."

Kuroda Jutaro, Vice Chairman of the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox), said at the banquet that the success of the Chinese exhibition shows that righteousness prevails over evil. He pointed out that the road ahead for the peoples of China and Japan is not smooth, but we will definitely achieve the final victory.

Tanaka Kunichiro, Chairman of the Central Japan Cooperative Committee for the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition, said that through this exhibition, Nagoya City and the Central Japan region will definitely see a new high tide of Sino-Japanese friendship and Sino-Japanese trade.

At the meeting, Kawase Ikkan, Chairman of the National Cooperative Committee for the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition in Japan, Yuya Kenko, Chairman of the Aichi Prefecture Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox), and Deputy Mayor of Nagoya City, Konjo Eijiro, also spoke. So did Sun Pinghua, Chief Representative of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office of the Liaison Office

    萧向前在庆祝我经济贸易展览会胜利闭幕的酒会上说
    中日友好运动将在更广阔道路上胜利前进
    美帝苏修及其追随者的破坏活动损害不了中日人民战斗友谊的一根毫毛
    据新华社十二日讯　名古屋消息：中国经济贸易展览团团长萧向前十一日晚间在名古屋举行盛大酒会，热烈庆祝在名古屋市举办的中国经济贸易展览会胜利闭幕。来自日本全国各地的各界朋友两千五百多人应邀出席了酒会。酒会充分地表现了中日两国人民对毛主席的无限热爱和敬仰，体现了两国人民在共同斗争中结成的战斗友谊。
    萧向前团长在酒会上致词说，展览会取得的成功，是中日两国人民向一切破坏者进行坚决斗争的结果。他说：“我们战胜了来自美帝国主义和各种各样的反动派、苏联现代修正主义及其形形色色的追随者的破坏和捣乱；经过我们的共同努力已经掀起了一个中日友好的新高潮，这是中日两国人民的胜利，这是毛泽东思想的胜利。”
    萧向前说，中日友好运动是一个不可阻挡的历史洪流，谁想破坏中日友好，谁就一定遭到孤立。那些伪称“友好”实际上反对日中友好的人，极力破坏展览会，恶毒地打击中国人民的真正朋友，他们已经成为右翼分子的同伙；但是，他们并不能损害中日两国人民战斗友谊的一根毫毛。他说，在毛泽东思想哺育下的中国人民将永远是日本人民的好朋友。中日友好运动将在一个更广阔的道路上胜利前进。
    日中友好协会（正统）总部副会长黑田寿男在酒会上讲话说，中国展览会的成功，表明正气压倒了邪气。他指出，日中两国人民的前进道路是不平坦的，但是，我们一定会取得最后胜利。
    中国经济贸易展览会中部日本协力会会长田中均一郎说，通过这次展览会，名古屋市和中部日本地区一定会出现日中友好和日中贸易的新高潮。
    在会上，中国经济贸易展览会日本全国协力会会长川濑一贯、日中友好协会爱知县（正统）总部会长有山兼孝、名古屋市副市长今城荣次郎等都讲了话。廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所首席代表孙平化也讲了话。
    应邀出席酒会的还有日本著名物理学家坂田昌一，社会党国会议员穗积七郎、近藤信一，日本著名剧作家依田义贤等。
    酒会自始至终充满着热烈友好的气氛。有的日本朋友情不自禁地跳上讲台，指挥大家用中文唱《大海航行靠舵手》的歌曲，当酒会快要结束时，日本朋友长时间地有节奏地鼓掌，并且随着节拍，热情地高呼“毛主席万岁，毛主席万岁！”
