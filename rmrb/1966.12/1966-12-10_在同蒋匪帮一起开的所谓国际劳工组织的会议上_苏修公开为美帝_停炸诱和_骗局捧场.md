At the so-called International Labour Organization meeting with the Chiang bandits, the Soviet revisionists openly support the US imperialists' "stop bombing for negotiations" trick

	Newspaper report from New Delhi, 9th December: According to reports from Singapore newspapers, the Soviet revisionist leadership sent representatives to attend the so-called 13th session of the Asian Consultative Committee of the International Labour Organization, controlled by the United States, which was held in Singapore from 28th November to 7th December. They sat on the same bench with the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits once again.

	This is the tenth time since last October that the Soviet revisionist leadership has sat with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Southeast Asia.

	According to reports, the Deputy Director of the Southeast Asia Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Goto, made a statement to the press on 1st December. He refused to condemn the US imperialists' aggression against Vietnam and the massacre of the Vietnamese people, and did not demand that the US aggressors immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Vietnam. Instead, he repeatedly advocated the complete implementation of the Geneva Agreement, which has long been torn to shreds by the Johnson administration's war actions, to solve the Vietnam problem.

	He also said that "the Soviet Union supports all proposals to stop bombing," openly supporting the US imperialists' "stop bombing for negotiations" trick. This once again exposed the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership, which pretends to support but actually betrays the Vietnamese people's struggle against US aggression for national salvation.

    在同蒋匪帮一起开的所谓国际劳工组织的会议上
    苏修公开为美帝“停炸诱和”骗局捧场
    新华社九日讯　新加坡消息：据新加坡报纸报道，苏联修正主义领导集团派代表出席了十一月二十八日到十二月七日在新加坡召开的由美国控制的国际劳工组织的所谓亚洲谘询委员会第十三届代表大会，又一次同蒋介石匪帮的代表坐在一条板凳上开会。
    这是从去年十月以来，苏联修正主义领导集团第十一次在东南亚地区同蒋介石匪帮坐在一起勾勾搭搭。
    据报道，出席这个会议的苏联外交部东南亚司副司长高托夫一日对报界发表谈话，拒不谴责美帝国主义侵略越南、屠杀越南人民的滔天罪行，不要求美国侵略强盗立即无条件撤出越南，却竭力重弹要完全履行早已被约翰逊政府的战争行动撕得粉碎的日内瓦协议来解决越南问题的滥调。
    他还说什么“苏联支持一切停止轰炸的建议”，公开为美帝国主义的“停炸诱和”的骗局捧场。这就再一次暴露了苏联修正主义领导集团对越南人民的抗美救国斗争假支持、真出卖的叛徒嘴脸。
