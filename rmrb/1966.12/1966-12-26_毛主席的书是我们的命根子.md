On August 8, 1966, a book-giving ceremony was held in the Jia Song Commune. At the meeting, the Nanhe County Committee handed over four volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" donated by a comrade from Wuhu City, Anhui Province, to the elderly poor peasant Zhao Xianbin of Cheng Pai Brigade. When the responsible comrade from the county's political department handed the brand-new four-volume treasure to Old Man Zhao Xianbin, Zhao Xianbin's eyes welled up with tears. He seemed to have a lot to say, but he didn't know where to start. In the end, he summed up all his thoughts in one sentence: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!"

To understand why the comrade from Anhui Province donated the books to Old Man Zhao, we need to start from the beginning.

In April, soldiers Zhang You'an and Zhang Tongqi from a certain unit of the Xingtai garrison came to the Fourth Team of Cheng Pai Brigade to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Every time a study session on Chairman Mao's works was held, the 59-year-old poor peasant Zhao Xianbin was always the first to arrive; when reading Chairman Mao's quotations, he sat in the front row; when telling stories about White and Zhang Side, he listened most attentively.

Once, a soldier told him, "Chairman Mao's books are the lifeline of the revolutionary people." He couldn't sleep for several nights after hearing this. He thought about how, in the old society, he suffered so much. It was Chairman Mao who led the people to overthrow the three big mountains and gain liberation. Later, Chairman Mao led the establishment of mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives, and people's communes, paving the way for socialism. He also thought about how the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, repeatedly foiled the plots of class enemies to restore capitalism. He excitedly said, "Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline!" From then on, he wanted to buy a set of Chairman Mao's books.

Soldiers Zhang You'an and Zhang Tongqi completed their mission and were about to leave. Before their departure, they handed over five single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works to the women's team leader, Cui Jinxi, asking her to distribute them to the commune members. When Old Man Zhao saw the books in Jinxi's hands, he was just about to say, "I want this one..." when they were quickly snatched away by a young man.

The incident of Old Man Zhao wanting Mao Zedong's works but not getting them was reported in the news article "Thousands of Support, Tens of Thousands of Support, Mao Zedong Thought is the Greatest Support" by a Xinhua News Agency reporter. The *Anhui Daily* published this news. A comrade working in Wuhu City, Anhui Province, saw this news and couldn't suppress his admiration for the old poor peasant. He sent his own set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to Old Man Zhao.

Since the report did not provide Old Man Zhao's detailed address, the books could not be sent directly to him. They were first sent to the CPC Xingtai Municipal Committee, requesting the committee to forward them. The CPC Xingtai Municipal Committee immediately dispatched someone to investigate and found that Zhao Xianbin was not a resident of Xingtai City. The books were then sent to the CPC Xingtai Regional Committee. The regional committee learned that Old Man Zhao lived in Cheng Pai Brigade, Jia Song Commune, Nanhe County, and immediately sent the books to the CPC Nanhe County Committee to be handed to Old Man Zhao.

The CPC Nanhe County Committee regarded this as a driving force to further promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the county and held a book-giving ceremony.

Inside the precious books sent from thousands of miles away was a letter to Old Man Zhao. The letter contained a quotation from Chairman Mao: "We all come from the rivers and lakes, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together."

The letter said: "Comrade Zhao Xianbin: I saw your boundless love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and I was deeply moved. Now I am sending you my set of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong.' Please accept it. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants. Whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will firmly fight to the end. The more the enemy opposes, the more we must master Mao Zedong Thought. We must carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end and strive for the realization of communism!"

At the end of the letter, the signature read: "Anhui Province Wuhu City 'Same Goal.'"

"Same Goal," what a meaningful name! Although it is not the real name of the sender, it is a synonym for the boundless love of all Chinese people for Chairman Mao, the boundless faith in Mao Zedong Thought, and the boundless longing for communism; it is also the common voice of the people of the entire nation.

Old Man Zhao held the four volumes of treasure, so happy that he couldn't close his mouth. When he returned home, he put on his glasses and, on the cover of the first volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," wrote excitedly in large characters: "Lifeline, Communism."

    毛主席的书是我们的命根子
    保广　慧来　金栋
    一九六六年八月八日，在贾宋公社召开了一个赠书大会。会上，南和县委把安徽省芜湖市一位同志赠给程牌大队老贫农赵宪斌的四卷《毛泽东选集》转交给本人。当县委政治部负责同志把崭新的四卷宝书递给赵宪斌老大爷时，赵宪斌热泪盈眶，像有许多话要说，可是一时又不知从何说起，结果千言万语汇成一句话：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    要问安徽省那位同志，为啥把宝书赠给赵大爷，这得从头说起。
    四月间，邢台驻军某部战士张友安、张同起来程牌大队第四队宣传毛泽东思想。每次开学习毛主席著作讲用会时，五十九岁的老贫农赵宪斌准来得最早；读毛主席语录，他坐得最靠前；讲白求恩、张思德的故事，他听得最入迷。
    有一回，一位解放军同志对他说：“毛主席的书是革命人民的命根子。”他听了，好几夜睡不着。他想到在旧社会受苦受难，是毛主席领导人民推翻了三座大山，才得到解放。后来，毛主席又领导成立互助组、农业生产合作社、人民公社，走上了社会主义道路。他又想到：广大贫下中农以毛泽东思想为武器，一次又一次粉碎了阶级敌人搞资本主义复辟的阴谋。他激动地说：“毛泽东思想是咱的命根子！”从那时起，他就想买一部毛主席的书。
    解放军战士张友安、张同起完成任务要走了。临行前，他们把五本毛主席著作单行本，交给了妇女队长崔金秀，让她送给社员。赵大爷看见金秀手里的书，正想开口说：“我要这本……”时，却被手疾眼快的小青年抢走了。
    赵大爷要毛主席著作而没有得到手的事，被新华社记者写在了《千支援，万支援，毛泽东思想是最大的支援》这篇新闻报道里。《安徽日报》登载了这条消息。在芜湖市工作的一位同志看了这条消息后，没法抑制对这位老贫农敬仰的感情，就把自己的一套《毛泽东选集》寄给了赵大爷。
    报上没写赵大爷的详细住址，无法把书直接寄给他，就先寄到中共邢台市委，请市委转交。中共邢台市委立即派人查找，查清赵宪斌不是邢台市人，就把书送到中共邢台地委。地委了解到赵大爷住在南和县贾宋公社程牌大队，立即把书送到中共南和县委转给赵大爷。
    中共南和县委把这看做是促进全县进一步开展活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的动力，就召开了赠书大会。
    从千里外寄来的这部宝书里边夹着一封给赵大爷的信。信笺上写着毛主席语录：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”
    信中说：“赵宪斌老大爷：我看到您老人家无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想，深受感动。现将自己的一套《毛泽东选集》送给您，望收下。毛泽东思想是我们贫下中农的命根子，谁反对毛泽东思想，我们就坚决和他拚到底。敌人越是反对，我们就越要掌握毛泽东思想。我们一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，一定要为实现共产主义而奋斗！”
    在信后面的署名是：安徽省芜湖市“同目标”。
      “同目标”，这是多么有意义的名字呵！它虽不是寄书人的真实姓名，但却是全中国人民无限热爱毛主席，无限信仰毛泽东思想，无限向往共产主义的同义语；也是全国人民的共同心声。
    赵大爷捧着四卷宝书，高兴得合不拢嘴，回到家，他戴上老花镜，在《毛泽东选集》第一卷的封面上，激动地写下了七个大字：“命根子，共产主义。”
