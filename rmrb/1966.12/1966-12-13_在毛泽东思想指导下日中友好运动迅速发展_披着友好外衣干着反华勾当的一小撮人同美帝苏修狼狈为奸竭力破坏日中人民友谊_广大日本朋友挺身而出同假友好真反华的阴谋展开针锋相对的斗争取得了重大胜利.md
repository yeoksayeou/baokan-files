Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Japan-China friendship movement is rapidly developing. A small clique of people, donning the disguise of friendship while engaging in anti-China activities, collude with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to sabotage the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China. Broad masses of Japanese friends have stood up to engage in a head-on struggle against the conspiracy of pseudo-friendship and genuine anti-China activities, achieving significant victories.

According to a report by our correspondent from Xinhua News Agency on December 12th, the Japan-China friendship movement has recently entered a new phase of great turmoil, great division, and great reorganization. Those who wear the mask of friendship while engaging in anti-China activities have been exposed; more genuine friends who hold high the banner of Japan-China friendship are advancing bravely. Under the brilliant illumination of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the Japan-China friendship movement, based on the opposition to the common enemy of U.S. imperialism, is rapidly advancing and forming an irresistible torrent that surges across the Japanese archipelago.

Since June of this year, those insincere friends, within the Japan-China friendship movement, have been promoting anti-China policies and opposing Mao Zedong Thought. They have colluded with U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and Japanese reactionaries to sabotage the friendly exchanges between Japan and China. At this critical moment, Japanese friends who value the fighting friendship between the peoples of the two countries have stood up to engage in a head-on struggle against the conspiracy of pseudo-friendship and genuine anti-China activities by these insincere friends.

On September 26th, 32 prominent figures from various sectors in Japan issued a statement titled "At a Time of Internal and External Crisis, Again Call on the People to Promote Japan-China Friendship," calling on the Japanese people to defend the glorious tradition of the Japan-China friendship movement. Subsequently, the Japan-China Friendship Association and the China-Japan Friendship Association signed a joint statement in Beijing, emphasizing the development of the fighting friendship between the peoples of the two countries. These two historic statements were maliciously attacked and sabotaged by the insincere friends, but they received a warm response from various democratic groups and progressive organizations in Japan. Since the end of October, the majority of leaders in many organizations have broken with the small clique of anti-China elements within these organizations and have successively established the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) Headquarters, the Asian-African Peoples' Solidarity Committee of Japan, and the Japan Journalists' Alliance. The Japan-China Trade Association is also being prepared. Immediately following this, local organizations of the Japan-China Friendship Association have expressed their support for the orthodox headquarters, and in the past one and a half months, 13 prefectures have established branches of the orthodox headquarters. Meanwhile, in the vast fields of politics, economy, culture, and society, more and more people have become more determined after this storm. The situation is developing rapidly and irresistibly, causing the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the new and old followers of Soviet modern revisionism to be in a state of panic.

In this process of great turmoil, great division, and great reorganization, a prominent feature is that Japanese friends are using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the Japan-China friendship movement. Many Japanese friends are actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in their actual struggles. Under the inspiration of the brilliant thesis that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, they fight against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries with increasing courage; under the guidance of the wise thesis that opposition to imperialism must include opposition to revisionism, they fight against the new and old followers of modern revisionism who advocate so-called "united action," with increasing clarity of direction; they draw inspiration from Chairman Mao's wise thesis that the Japanese nation is a great nation, enhancing their courage; they seek their stand, viewpoint, and method from "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." Leaders engaged in the Japan-China friendship movement attach great importance to the significant role of Chairman Mao's works in guiding the movement.

The recent meeting of the Standing Committee and active members of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) Headquarters emphasized that to further develop the Japan-China friendship movement, it is necessary to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. The broad masses of the Japanese people have voluntarily organized to study Chairman Mao's works. They, like the Chinese people, carry the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them and find answers in it when they encounter problems. A common Osaka woman expressed the feelings of hundreds of millions of Japanese people to a Chinese friend with her personal experience. She said: "Great Chairman Mao is your leader and also our leader. You never part with the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' and neither do we. Mao Zedong Thought is the microscope that distinguishes friends from enemies... We will resolutely fight against U.S. imperialism, Japanese reactionaries, Soviet revisionism, and all their new and old followers. We have limitless respect for Chairman Mao and wish Chairman Mao eternal life."

In this way, Japanese friends have completely combined the study of Chairman Mao's works with the Japan-China friendship movement. The more they love Chairman Mao and read Chairman Mao's books, the more they love socialist China led by Chairman Mao and the Chinese people who act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and thus the more enthusiastically they carry out the Japan-China friendship movement. Today, the fighting unity between the peoples of the two countries is closer than ever before, the banner of Japan-China friendship is held higher than ever before, and the Japan-China friendship movement is more extensive and deeper than ever before.

The U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and Soviet modern revisionism, along with all their new and old followers, fear the spread of Mao Zedong Thought the most and the development of the Japan-China friendship movement the most, and thus resort to all kinds of sabotage. However, precisely because Mao Zedong Thought is the truth of the proletariat, the more the enemy opposes it, the more it penetrates people's hearts; precisely because the Japan-China friendship movement has become an irresistible historical trend, the more the enemy opposes it, the more it develops and grows.

Anti-China elements viciously obstruct and sabotage the sale of Chairman Mao's works in Japan, but "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" are out of stock in Japanese bookstores. The "Quotations from Chairman Mao" have so far been published in several editions in Japan. Recently, Japanese friends have established the "Eastern Bookstore" to popularize Marxist-Leninist books and Chairman Mao's works.

Anti-China elements have even issued orders to organizations and individuals under their control, forbidding them to read Chairman Mao's books, hang Chairman Mao's portraits, and listen to Beijing broadcasts that propagate Mao Zedong Thought. But these evil practices immediately encountered strong opposition from the Japanese people. Kamiya Kei of Yamanashi Prefecture said: Because Mao Zedong Thought is the truth, the people must grasp it. He said: Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon for developing the fighting friendship between the peoples of the two countries and the sharpest weapon for defeating our common enemy, U.S. imperialism. A Japanese friend from Yamaguchi Prefecture said that they were formally notified to remove the hanging portrait of Chairman Mao, but they did not comply, and they continue to hang the portrait of their most respected Chairman Mao.

"When the plot is revealed, the dagger is exposed." Anti-China elements openly sabotage the friendly exchanges between the two peoples within the Japan-China friendship movement, sabotage the Second Japan-China Youth Friendship Festival, and sabotage the China Economic and Trade Exhibition. However, all their sabotage activities have failed one after another. The China Economic and Trade Exhibitions held in Kitakyushu and Nagoya, with the assistance of the broad masses of the Japanese people, vigorously publicized the magnificent achievements of the Chinese people in the past 17 years under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and were warmly welcomed by the Japanese people, achieving unprecedented success.

The situation shows that the China-Japan friendship movement is indestructible, and the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan has withstood the test of storms. No matter what reverse currents, muddy currents, or undercurrents appear, they cannot stop the forward march of this historical torrent. Those who oppose it will be spat upon by the people; the more fiercely they oppose it, the more miserably they will fail. Long live the indestructible fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan!

    在毛泽东思想指导下日中友好运动迅速发展
    披着友好外衣干着反华勾当的一小撮人同美帝苏修狼狈为奸竭力破坏日中人民友谊  广大日本朋友挺身而出同假友好真反华的阴谋展开针锋相对的斗争取得了重大胜利
    据新华社十二日讯本社记者报道：日中友好运动近来出现了大动荡、大分化、大改组的新局面。披着友好外衣干着反华勾当的一小撮人原形毕露；高举日中友好大旗的更多的真朋友奋勇直前。在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，以反对共同敌人美帝国主义为基础的日中友好运动，正在迅速向前发展，形成一支不可抗拒的洪流，澎湃于日本列岛。
    今年六月以来，那些口蜜腹剑的假朋友，在日中友好运动内部推行反华政策，反对毛泽东思想。他们同美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和日本反动派狼狈为奸，一股劲地破坏日中友好往来。就在这关键时刻，以日中两国人民战斗友谊为重的日本朋友们挺身而出，同假朋友的假友好真反华的阴谋活动展开了针锋相对的斗争。
    九月二十六日，三十二位日本各界知名人士发表了“在内外危机的时候，再次呼吁国民促进日中友好”的声明，号召日本人民保卫日中友好运动的光荣传统。接着，日中友好协会和中日友好协会代表团在北京签署了共同声明，强调发展日中两国人民的战斗友谊。这两个具有历史意义的声明遭到了假朋友的恶意攻击和破坏，但是，受到了日本各民主团体和进步组织的热烈响应。十月末以来，不少团体中的绝大多数领导人，同这些组织中的一小撮反华分子决裂，并相继成立了日中友好协会（正统）总部、亚非人民团结日本委员会和日本记者同盟，日中贸易会也在筹备中。紧跟着，日中友好协会的地方组织纷纷表示支持正统总部，在从十月末以来的一个半月中，已经有十三个府县成立了正统总部的分会。与此同时，在政治、经济、文化以及社会的广阔领域中，越来越多的人经过这场风雨更加坚定起来。形势的发展迅猛异常，势不可挡，致使美日反动派和苏联现代修正主义者的新旧追随者惊慌失措。
    在这大动荡、大分化、大改组的过程中，一个最突出的特点，就是日本朋友用毛泽东思想来指导日中友好运动。很多日本朋友都在实际斗争中活学活用毛主席著作。他们在帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的这一光辉论断的鼓舞下，同美日反动派斗争，越斗越勇；他们在反对帝国主义必须反对修正主义的英明论断的指引下，同那些主张所谓“联合行动”的现代修正主义者的新旧追随者斗争，越斗方向越明；他们从毛主席的“日本民族是一个伟大的民族”的英明论断中得到鼓舞，增强勇气；他们从《实践论》和《矛盾论》中寻求立场、观点、方法。从事日中友好运动的领导人非常重视毛主席著作对指导运动的重大意义。
    最近举行的日中友好协会（正统）总部常任理事和积极分子联席会议强调指出，为了进一步发展日中友好运动必须活学活用毛主席著作。广大的日本人民自动地组织起来学习毛主席著作。他们同中国人民一样，随身带着《毛主席语录》，遇到问题就从语录中找答案。一位普通的大阪妇女以亲身的体会向中国朋友说出了亿万日本人民的心情。她说：“伟大的毛泽东主席是你们的统帅，也是我们的领袖，你们时刻不离《毛主席语录》，我们也时刻不离《毛主席语录》。毛泽东思想是衡量谁是敌人、谁是朋友的显微镜……我们坚决要同美帝国主义、日本反动派、苏联修正主义及其形形色色的新旧追随者进行斗争。我们无限地尊敬毛主席，祝毛主席万寿无疆。”
    就这样，日本朋友把学习毛主席著作和从事日中友好运动完全结合起来。他们越是热爱毛主席和读毛主席的书，就越是热爱毛主席领导的社会主义的中国和照毛主席的指示办事的中国人民，因此也就越是干劲冲天地展开日中友好运动。今天，日中两国人民的战斗团结比以往任何时候更加紧密，日中友好的旗帜比以往任何时候举得都高，日中友好运动比以往任何时候开展得更广泛更深入。
    美日反动派和苏联现代修正主义及其形形色色的新旧追随者最怕毛泽东思想的传播，最怕日中友好运动的发展，因此千方百计地横加破坏。但是，正因为毛泽东思想是无产阶级的真理，敌人越反对它，它就越深入人心；正因为日中友好运动成为不可抗拒的历史潮流，敌人越反对它，它就越发展壮大。
    反华分子卑鄙地阻挠和破坏毛主席著作在日本出售，但《毛泽东选集》在日本经销书店中普遍脱销。《毛主席语录》到目前为止在日本已经发行了好几种版本。最近，日本朋友又成立了“东方书店”，专门普及马克思列宁主义书籍和毛主席著作。
    反华分子竟然给受他们控制的团体和个人下禁令，不准读毛主席的书、挂毛主席的像和收听宣传毛泽东思想的北京广播。但这些恶劣作法当即遭到日本人民的强烈反对。山梨县的神宫寺敬说：因为毛泽东思想是真理，所以人民要掌握它。他说：毛泽东思想是发展日中两国人民战斗友谊的最锐利的武器，是战胜我们共同敌人美帝国主义的最锐利的武器。山口县的一位日本朋友说，有人正式通知他们要撤下悬挂着的毛主席像，但他们没有照办，他们一直挂着最敬爱的毛主席的像。
    “图穷匕首见”。反华分子公开从日中友好运动内部破坏两国人民的友好往来、破坏第二届中日青年友好大联欢、破坏中国经济贸易展览会。但是，他们这些破坏活动全都一个接着一个地失败了。先后在北九州和名古屋举行的中国经济贸易展览会，在广大日本人民的协助下，大张旗鼓地宣传了十七年来中国人民在毛泽东思想的指引下所取得的宏伟成就，受到了日本人民的热烈欢迎，获得了空前的成功。
    形势表明，中日友好运动是谁也破坏不了的，中日人民的战斗友谊是经受了风雨的考验的。不管出现什么逆流、浊流、暗流，都不能阻挡这个历史洪流的前进。谁反对它，谁就要被人民所唾弃；谁反对得最凶，谁就失败得最惨。中日两国人民的牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
