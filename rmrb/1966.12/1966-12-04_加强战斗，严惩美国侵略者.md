	American imperialism, disregarding the strong condemnation of the people of the world, has once again taken a new and serious step to escalate the war in its aggression against Vietnam. On December 2, American bandit planes carried out savage bombing raids on the city of Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This brazen war crime by American imperialism has aroused the great indignation of revolutionary people all over the world.

	Recently, in an attempt to find a way out of a dead end, the Johnson administration has been playing many tricks on the Vietnam issue: spreading the air of "stopping the bombing" of the North; putting on a hypocritical face of being willing to "negotiate for peace"; spreading the insidious arguments of "ceasefire" and "stopping the war," and so on. All these are aimed at deceiving the Vietnamese people into stopping their sacred struggle against American aggression and saving the nation, and also at using the smoke screen of "peace" to cover up the American aggressive deployment to further expand the war. The American bombing of Hanoi is another vicious means of putting pressure on the Vietnamese people, and at the same time, it has once again exposed its "peace" mask.

	The Soviet leadership clique has colluded with American imperialism to jointly plot to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people. Recently, the British and Canadian foreign ministers, as political agents of the United States, have been active in Moscow, and the Soviet leadership clique has had "very harmonious" talks with them. This clearly exposes the traitorous face of the Soviet leadership clique.

	The Vietnamese nation is a heroic nation. The Vietnamese people are a great people. They have undergone the long test of revolutionary warfare, and they have achieved brilliant victories in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. Such a nation is invincible. The savage bombing by American imperialism cannot frighten the heroic Vietnamese people, nor can it shake the Vietnamese people's determination to fight against American aggression and save the nation. The military and civilians of Hanoi have made a solemn vow to strengthen the fight to strike down the American bandits. The statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the 3rd pointed out: The Vietnamese people will certainly realize the call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh: "To defend the independence of the motherland, to fulfill the obligations to the peoples who are fighting against American imperialism, our entire people and army will unite as one, fear no hardships and sacrifices, and fight resolutely to final victory."

	This is the Vietnamese people's solemn and powerful response to the American imperialist war crime of escalating the war.

	Chairman Mao said: "The just cause is invincible." The Vietnamese people's great struggle against American aggression and for national salvation is a just cause. Whether American imperialism expands the war or plays the "peace" trick, it is doomed to failure. The Chinese people are determined to be the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people and to provide full support to the Vietnamese people's just cause, thoroughly defeating the American aggressors.

    加强战斗，严惩美国侵略者
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义不顾世界人民的强烈谴责，在侵略越南的战争中又一次采取了新的严重的战争“升级”行动。十二月二日，美国强盗飞机对越南民主共和国首都河内市区进行了野蛮轰炸。美帝国主义这一猖狂的战争罪行，激起了全世界革命人民的极大愤慨。
    最近，为了从死胡同里找出路，约翰逊政府在越南问题上搞了不少鬼名堂：放出“停炸”北方的诱和空气；装出愿意“和平谈判”的伪善面孔；散布“休战”、“停火”的别有用心的论调，等等。所有这一切，都是要诱骗越南人民停止抗美救国的神圣斗争，也是要用“和平”的烟幕来掩盖美国进一步扩大战争的侵略部署。美国派飞机猖狂轰炸河内，是它向越南人民施加压力的又一罪恶手段，同时，也再一次戳穿了它的“和平”假面具。
    苏联领导集团同美帝国主义相互勾结，共同策划扑灭越南人民的革命烈火。近来，英国和加拿大外长，作为美国的政治掮客到莫斯科进行活动，苏联领导集团同他们谈得“非常投机”。这就清楚地暴露了苏联领导集团的叛徒嘴脸。
    越南民族是英雄的民族。越南人民是伟大的人民。他们经历了革命战火的长期考验，他们取得了抗美救国斗争的辉煌胜利。这样的民族，是不可战胜的。美帝国主义的野蛮轰炸吓不倒英雄的越南人民，更动摇不了越南人民抗美救国的决心。河内军民发出庄严的誓言，决心以加强战斗来打击美国强盗。越南民主共和国外交部三日的声明指出：越南人民必将实现胡志明主席的号召：“为了保卫祖国的独立，为了履行对正在反对美帝国主义的各个民族所承担的义务，我国全民和全军团结一致，不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决战斗到彻底胜利。”
    这是越南人民对美帝战争“升级”罪行的严正的、有力的回答。
    毛主席说：“正义的事业是任何敌人也攻不破的。”越南人民的伟大抗美救国斗争是正义的事业。不管美帝国主义扩大战争也好，玩弄“和平”骗局也好，都是注定要失败的。中国人民誓做越南人民的坚强后盾，全力支援越南人民的正义事业，彻底打败美国侵略者。
