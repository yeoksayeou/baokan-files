Mao Zedong Thought is the source of our wisdom and strength. It reflects the objective laws of the Chinese revolution and the world revolutionary struggle. Therefore, only by continually learning and mastering Mao Zedong Thought in the course of struggle can we grasp the objective laws of things, and only thus can we swim freely in the great waves of struggle and reach the other shore in victory.

Yu Chunpu

The most fundamental and primary aspect of learning warfare from warfare is to arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought, to foster a spirit of devotion to the revolution and thoroughgoing revolution. Only with such a spirit can one consciously enter the practice of warfare, and only then can one speak of "learning warfare from warfare." Without such a spirit, one cannot even enter the gates of the revolutionary war university. Learning warfare is like this; learning anything else is the same. Only by harboring the ambition to conquer rivers, lakes, and seas, and daring to dive in, can one learn to swim; only by fostering a spirit of thoroughgoing revolution and joining the masses in plunging into the torrent of class struggle can one learn the skills of class struggle. As long as we act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, dare to forge ahead for the revolution, there is nothing in the world that cannot be understood and mastered, no skill that cannot be learned, and no enemy that cannot be defeated.

Lan Qinghe

Chairman Mao teaches us, "'Nothing is impossible for one who has the will.' Entry is not difficult, and advanced study is also possible, as long as one has the will and knows how to learn." We young people lack knowledge of class struggle. However, as long as we learn diligently in the practice of class struggle, we are sure to master the skills of class struggle.

Zhou Dunxiang

In the years of war, our countless soldiers, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, had the heroic spirit of defying all enemies, daring to struggle, and daring to win. No matter how complex and difficult the conditions, we could always find ways to defeat the enemy and achieve one victory after another. Moreover, in the course of war, we gradually learned the ability to control warfare.

Zhang Chunli

Being good at learning means not only being good at learning from books but, more importantly, being good at learning from the masses in the course of struggle, learning from everything, at all times, and forever being a student of the masses.

    智慧和力量的源泉
    毛泽东思想是我们智慧和力量的源泉，它反映了中国革命和世界革命斗争的客观规律。因此，只有在斗争中不断学习和掌握毛泽东思想，才有可能掌握事物的客观规律，才有可能在斗争的大风浪里自由地游泳，而使自己胜利地达到彼岸。
                                        于春圃
    从战争学会战争，最首要最根本的，是用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，树立献身革命、彻底革命的精神。有了这样的精神，才能勇于自觉地到战争的实践中去，才能谈得到“从战争学习战争”。没有这样的精神，根本就进不了革命战争大学的校门。学习战争如此，学习任何其他东西也是一样。只有树立征服江河湖海的雄心壮志，敢于下水，才能学会游泳；只有树立彻底革命的精神，和群众一起投身到阶级斗争的洪流中去，才能学会阶级斗争的本领。只要我们处处照毛主席的教导办事，为革命敢闯敢干，世上没有不可认识和驾驭的事物，没有学不会的本领，没有不可战胜的敌人。　　　　　　　　　　　
　　兰清河
    毛主席教导我们，“‘世上无难事，只怕有心人。’入门既不难，深造也是办得到的，只要有心，只要善于学习罢了。”我们年青人缺少阶级斗争的知识。但是，只要在阶级斗争的实践中，处处用心学习，我们是一定能够学会阶级斗争的。
                                      周敦祥
    在战争年代，我们千千万万的战士，在毛泽东思想指挥下有藐视一切敌人，敢于斗争，敢于胜利的英雄气概，不论在任何复杂困难的条件下，我们都能想出克敌制胜的办法，取得一个又一个的胜利。并且在战争中逐渐学会了驾驭战争的能力。
                                        张春礼
    善于学习，不仅是要善于学习书本上的知识，更重要的是善于在斗争中向群众学习，事事学，时时学，永远做群众的小学生。
