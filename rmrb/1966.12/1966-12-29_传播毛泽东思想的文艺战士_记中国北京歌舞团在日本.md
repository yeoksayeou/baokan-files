"Salute to the good students of Chairman Mao, the propagators of Mao Zedong Thought!" This is a dedication given by a Japanese friend who assisted the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe in Osaka to the Chinese performers. This dedication not only reflects the sincere and friendly feelings of Japanese friends but also summarizes the evaluation of the broad masses of Japanese audience towards the Chinese music and dance workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Bringing Combat Friendship to the Japanese People

The Beijing Song and Dance Troupe recently toured various parts of Japan for two months, performing for over 80,000 people. The broad masses of the Japanese people praised their performances for bringing the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, the spirit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the friendship of 700 million Chinese people.

A teacher named Ping Tian Xuan Zhai from Gifu Prefecture, after watching the performance of the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe, could not help but write in the guestbook: "Chairman Mao is the great savior of Asia and the world!" This is the voice from the hearts of the broad masses of the Japanese people.

Whether in the guestbook or in the notebooks of Chinese performers, they are filled with words expressing the boundless love of the broad masses of Japanese friends for Chairman Mao.

A student named Tanaka Sei from Amagasaki City, Hyogo Prefecture, wrote: "You are the great students specially sent by Chairman Mao. We sincerely thank Chairman Mao for his concern for us and the great friendship of the Chinese people."

Wholeheartedly Serving the Masses of the Japanese People

Chairman Mao said: "Our literature and art are for the people." The Beijing Song and Dance Troupe follows Chairman Mao's teachings and, from the day they arrived in Japan, has taken the Japanese masses as their service objects. They relied on friendly Japanese friends, broke through various obstacles, and did everything possible to reach the workers and peasants.

The example of Beijing Song and Dance Troupe performers going to the countryside in Saitama Prefecture to visit the poor, ask about their hardships, and help with harvesting has been widely circulated among the Japanese people. A local railway worker wrote to the troupe: "The countryside you visited is not far from my home. I was very moved to hear this news. I understand why the farmers want you to wear Chairman Mao's badge on their chests. Because you are sent by Chairman Mao. They will forever remember Chairman Mao in their hearts."

During the interval of their performance in Tokyo, the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe also visited the national railway Ooimachi vehicle repair shop. The workers, who were working, were initially surprised to see the Chinese performers enter the workshop. Later, when their greasy hands were firmly grasped by the Chinese performers, they felt a warm current flowing into their hearts. They excitedly said: "No foreign artists have ever come to our workshop. Chinese performers are truly serving the workers and peasants."

The Beijing Song and Dance Troupe held many small-scale performances in Japan. Wherever there were working people who wanted to watch a play, they went there to perform. After the performance in Kanazawa City, they were about to leave the next day. They heard that the hotel staff had not been able to see their performance due to their busy work, so the troupe performed a special show for dozens of staff members in a small room in the hotel. Some female staff members were so moved that they shed tears of joy and could not help but hold the hands of the Chinese female performers, saying: "You are the best people in the world."

"This Is a True Proletarian Artist"

Many Japanese stage workers who assisted the troupe's performance had previously worked on the stage for many foreign troupes. They had received American "singers" and also received the so-called "performers" of the Soviet revisionist clique. They said: "The Soviet performers are the same as the American performers, while the Chinese performers are the true proletarian artists."

What impressed them the most was that within the troupe, whether it was the director or the performers, they all acted as ordinary workers, leading the entire team to load and unload the stage, carry props, and clean the venue after each performance. A Japanese stage worker said: "Other foreign performers, after finishing the performance, would go drinking and playing with women. They never do any manual work. But the Chinese performers work with us and take on the heavy and dirty work. They eat and stay with us. Such artists who love and respect labor truly belong to the working class."

The troupe members cleaned their own rooms and washed their own clothes in the hotel, cleaned up the dishes in the dining room, and sometimes got up early to help with the kitchen work. This was something unheard of in Japan. An old female service staff at a hotel in Mie Prefecture told the troupe's interpreter: "Although I have not seen Chairman Mao, I have seen such young people from China, and I have come to know that Mao Zedong is indeed a great person."

In addition to traveling, the troupe members performed every day, sometimes two shows a day, but the study of Chairman Mao's works was never neglected. The great Mao Zedong Thought gave them boundless strength. A dancer fell ill with stomach problems during the trip and could not eat normally for two or three days, but still performed on stage. When his stomach was in great pain, he did not complain but lay calmly on the bed, holding Chairman Mao's works and reading them intently.

The Beijing Song and Dance Troupe not only spread Mao Zedong Thought through their performances but also, through their actions, vividly reflected the spiritual face of the Chinese people under Chairman Mao's guidance. A Japanese friend who had been with the Chinese performers for two months told a Chinese reporter: "These young people are truly from socialist China, which is undergoing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

### 传播毛泽东思想的文艺战士——记中国北京歌舞团在日本

    传播毛泽东思想的文艺战士
    ——记中国北京歌舞团在日本
    “向毛主席的好学生、毛泽东思想的宣传队致敬！”这是一位在大阪协助中国北京歌舞团工作的日本朋友赠给中国演员的一句题词。这句题词不仅反映了日本朋友的真挚、友好的感情，而且概括了广大日本观众对于用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国音乐舞蹈工作者的评价。
    给日本人民带来了战斗友谊
    中国北京歌舞团最近在日本各地进行了两个月的访问演出，观众达八万多人。广大日本人民赞扬他们的演出带来了毛泽东思想的光辉，带来了无产阶级文化大革命的精神，带来了七亿中国人民的友谊。
    岐阜县一位名叫平田玄斋的教师看过北京歌舞团的演出后，情不自禁地在留言簿上写道：“毛主席是亚洲和全世界的大救星！”这是出自广大日本人民心底的话。
    不论是在留言簿上，或者是中国演员的笔记本上，都写满了广大日本朋友表达自己无限热爱毛主席的词句。
    兵库县尼崎市的一位叫田中成的学生写道：“你们是伟大的毛主席特意派来的。我们衷心地感谢毛主席对我们的关怀，感谢中国人民的伟大友谊。”
  全心全意为日本人民大众服务
    毛主席说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的”。北京歌舞团遵循毛主席的教导，从到日本那天起，就把日本的人民大众作为自己的服务对象。他们依靠友好的日本朋友，冲破了种种障碍，想尽办法深入到工农群众中去。
    北京歌舞团演员深入到埼玉县农村访贫问苦帮助收割庄稼的事例，在日本人民中间广泛地流传着。当地的一位铁路工人给歌舞团写信说：“你们去过的农村离我的家不远，我听到这一消息非常感动。我了解农民为什么要请你们把毛主席像章戴在他们的胸前。这是因为，你们是毛主席派来的。他们将把毛主席永远记在心里。”
    北京歌舞团在东京公演的空隙，还曾到国营铁路大井车辆修理厂访问。正在劳动的工人，看见中国的演员走进车间，起初是惊愕，后来当他们的油污的手被中国演员紧紧握住的时候，就感到有一股热流传到他们心里。他们激动地说：“还从来没有外国艺术家到我们车间里来过。中国的演员，不愧是为工农大众服务的。”
    北京歌舞团在日本举行了很多场小型演出。那里有劳动人民要看戏，他们就到那里去演出。在金泽市演出结束后第二天就要离开那里的时候，听说旅馆的服务员因为工作忙没有看到他们的演出，于是歌舞团就在旅馆内一间不大的房子里，专门为几十位服务员演了一场。有的女服务员感动得流出热泪，禁不住拉住中国女演员的手说：你们是世界上最好的人。
    “这才是无产阶级的艺术家”
    协助歌舞团演出的日本舞台工作人员，很多人过去多次给外国的剧团做过舞台工作。他们接待过美国的“歌手”，也接待过苏联修正主义集团的所谓“演员”。他们说：苏联的演员和美国的演员一样，而中国的演员才是真正的无产阶级艺术家。
    使他们印象最深的是歌舞团内不论是团长、还是演员，都是以普通劳动者身份，在每一次演出时，带头和全团人员一样装卸舞台，搬运道具，打扫场地。一位日本舞台工人说：别的外国演员演完戏以后，一甩手就去喝酒、玩女人去了。从不动手干活。而中国演员却和我们一起劳动，而且挑重活、脏活做。吃饭、住宿和我们一样。这样热爱劳动、尊重劳动的艺术家，才是属于工人阶级的。
    歌舞团团员在旅馆自己打扫房间、洗衣服，在食堂自己收拾碗筷，有时还早起帮厨，这是在日本从没有听说过的事。三重县一家旅馆的老女服务员对歌舞团的翻译人员说：“我虽然没有见过毛主席，但是见到了这样一些中国的年轻人，我就认识到了毛泽东的确是个伟大的人物。”
    除了在旅途中，歌舞团团员每天都要演戏，有时一天要演两场，但是学习毛主席著作却从来没有耽误过。伟大的毛泽东思想，给予了他们无穷无尽的力量。一位舞蹈演员在旅途中患了胃病，两三天不能正常吃饭，照样登台表演。在他胃疼难熬的时候，不是叫苦，而是镇定地躺在床上抱着毛主席著作专心阅读。
    中国北京歌舞团不仅通过自己的演出，传播了毛泽东思想，而且通过他们的行动，具体、生动地反映了在毛主席的教导下，中国人民的精神面貌。一位两个月一直同中国演员在一起的日本朋友对中国记者说：“这些年轻人不愧是来自正在进行着无产阶级文化大革命的社会主义中国。”
