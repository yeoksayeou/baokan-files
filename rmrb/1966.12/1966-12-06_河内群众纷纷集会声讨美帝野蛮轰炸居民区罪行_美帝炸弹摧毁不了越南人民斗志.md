Hanoi residents in areas, factories, and schools hit by U.S. aggressor planes have been holding meetings in recent days to angrily denounce the U.S. aggressor planes' barbaric bombing of residential areas in Hanoi. Participants unanimously expressed their determination to carry out Chairman Ho Chi Minh's battle call, to fear no hardship or sacrifice, to fight bravely, and to decisively defeat the U.S. aggressor invaders.

Workers and militia members from a factory in Hanoi, after the U.S. aggressor planes bombed Hanoi again on the 2nd, held consecutive meetings in their workshops to denounce the U.S. imperialists' crimes. Militia members who participated in the capital's defense battle said passionately, "The more barbaric the U.S. aggressors are, the more hatred they arouse in us. The U.S. imperialists think they can intimidate us with bombs, but that is a foolish dream." The factory workers passed a resolution at the meeting, pledging to seize every second to produce, to strengthen military training, to be ready for battle at any time, and to punish the U.S. air pirates more severely and accurately.

Representatives from residents of Hanoi's Ba Dinh District, which was attacked by U.S. aggressor planes on the 2nd, also held a meeting. They indignantly denounced the U.S. aggressors' barbaric crimes and vowed to demand blood debt from the U.S. aggressor invaders.

Schools, factories, and agricultural cooperatives in Hanoi's suburban Thanh Tri District, which were hit by U.S. aggressor planes, also held meetings to denounce U.S. imperialist crimes. Chen Rishi, principal of a secondary school, said angrily at a meeting, "The inhuman U.S. aggressors may have destroyed our school, but the U.S. aggressors' bombs will never destroy our fighting will. We will definitely carry out Chairman Ho's teachings. Even if the U.S. imperialists destroy Hanoi, we will definitely complete the task of resisting the U.S. and saving the nation."

Currently, these areas, factories, schools, and agricultural production cooperatives in Hanoi that were hit by U.S. aggressor planes are overcoming difficulties, continuing production and work, and actively strengthening all battle preparations. They are determined, together with the entire city's military and civilians, to defend the capital and smash all attacks by the U.S. air pirates.

    河内群众纷纷集会声讨美帝野蛮轰炸居民区罪行
    美帝炸弹摧毁不了越南人民斗志
    据新华社河内五日电  遭受美国强盗飞机袭击的河内市的一些街区、工厂和学校，连日来纷纷举行集会，愤怒声讨美国强盗飞机再次野蛮轰炸河内市居民区的滔天罪行。参加集会的群众一致表示，坚决实现胡志明主席的战斗号召，不怕艰苦、牺牲，英勇战斗，决心彻底战胜美国侵略强盗。
    河内一个工厂的职工和自卫队员，在美国强盗飞机二日再次轰炸河内后，分别在车间连续举行声讨美帝罪行大会。参加了这次首都保卫战斗的自卫队员们激昂地说，美国强盗越野蛮，就越激起我们的仇恨。美帝国主义企图用炸弹来吓倒我们，这是痴心妄想。这个工厂的职工们在会上通过一项决心书，保证在任何情况下，都要分秒必争地进行生产，大力加强军事训练，随时准备战斗，更狠更准地惩罚美国空中强盗。
    二日遭受美国强盗飞机袭击的河内市二征夫人区的居民代表也举行了大会，义愤填膺地控诉美国强盗的野蛮罪行。他们表示，决心向美国侵略强盗讨还血债。
    遭受美国强盗飞机袭击的河内市郊清池县的一些学校、工厂和农业合作社，也纷纷举行声讨美帝国主义罪行的集会。一个普通中学的校长陈日诗在一次集会上愤慨地说，灭绝人性的美国强盗虽然炸毁了我们的学校，但是，美国强盗的炸弹永远摧毁不了我们的战斗意志。我们坚决实现胡主席的教导，即使美帝国主义把河内摧毁，我们也要坚决完成抗美救国斗争的任务。
    目前，这些遭受美国强盗飞机袭击的河内市街区、工厂、学校和农业生产合作社，正在一面克服困难，坚持生产和工作，一面积极加强各项战斗准备，决心同全市军民一道，保卫首都，粉碎美国空中强盗的一切进攻。（附图片）
