	Once, a flight was filled with passengers from various countries, among whom were many travelers from the German Democratic Republic. The flight attendants handed out some revolutionary song sheets to them. As soon as they received them, they began singing "The East Is Red," singing it over and over again with great enthusiasm. Then, they requested that the flight attendants teach them "The Ship Sails on Because of the Helmsman." They said: They love Chairman Mao and must learn songs in China that praise Chairman Mao, to sing them when they return home.

    在中国学了回国内去唱
    有一次航班满载着各国来的旅客，其中有很多是德意志民主共和国的旅行者。乘务员发给了他们一些革命歌曲的歌片。他们一拿到手，就高唱起《东方红》来，唱了一遍又一遍。热情很高。接着，他们又要求乘务员教他们唱《大海航行靠舵手》。他们说：他们热爱毛主席，一定要在中国学会歌颂毛主席的歌曲，回国去唱。
