Knowing the Past Hardships, We Appreciate Today's Sweetness

I watched the clay sculpture exhibition "The Rent Collection Courtyard" with a heart full of indignation. I was born after liberation and have not experienced the hardships of the old society. After watching the exhibition, I truly saw the miserable lives of the broad masses of laboring people in China before liberation.

Seeing the hardships of the old society, I appreciate the sweetness of the new society even more. I love our great leader Chairman Mao endlessly. Chairman Mao! We will always follow your words and act according to your instructions. We will always remember class enmity and always remember that three-quarters of the world's people are still living in misery. We will always follow you and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

We Will Never Allow Them to Restore "The Rent Collection Courtyard"

We are all children of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. Today, we visited the clay sculpture exhibition "The Rent Collection Courtyard" and received a profound class education. The sufferings of our fathers in the old society are once again displayed before us. We hate the evil old society and all exploitative systems. We will inherit the will of our fathers, always follow the Party, and follow Chairman Mao to make revolution to the end.

The current Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is a sharp class struggle. The overthrown exploiting classes want to change the situation and restore their "Rent Collection Courtyard," to once again oppress the laboring people. This will not happen! Not in a thousand ways! Not in ten thousand ways! We, the children of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, must remember the blood and tears, never forget class sufferings, and defend the iron-clad mountains and rivers of the proletariat to keep them from changing color.

"Forgetting the Past Means Betrayal"

Reviewing the past to understand the present, recalling hardships to appreciate sweetness. Through this live class education course of the clay sculpture "The Rent Collection Courtyard," I understand that in the past, those who only cared about eating and wearing fine clothes and picking the best were forgetting their roots. Forgetting the past means betrayal. I am a child of poor and lower-middle peasants. I must inherit the glorious traditions of the revolutionary forerunners, never forget class sufferings, always remember the blood and tears, read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, and make revolution for a lifetime.

It Is Because of Chairman Mao That We Have Today's Happiness

Seeing "The Rent Collection Courtyard" made me think of my family's tragic life under the evil rule of the landlords. My father and mother both died at the hands of the landlords. From the age of seven, I became a slave for the landlords, living a life worse than cattle. It was not until I was fourteen that the Party and Chairman Mao rescued me from the darkness. From then on, I was no longer a slave, and we poor people had the opportunity to go to school. Today, I am a glorious Red Guard. Thinking of the past and thinking of today, and seeing this clay sculpture exhibition, I understand that without Chairman Mao's leadership, there would be no today for us slaves. I love Chairman Mao even more. I will always follow Chairman Mao's words, be a good student of Chairman Mao, and make revolution with Chairman Mao for a lifetime!

Be a Little Red Soldier of Chairman Mao

After visiting the clay sculpture "The Rent Collection Courtyard," a flame of hatred burned in my heart. I understand even more the sufferings of the laboring people in our country in the past, which were due to the oppression of the three big mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism.

Today, those who have infiltrated the Party and are in power while taking the capitalist road are vigorously opposing the great Mao Zedong Thought, dreaming of carrying out a "peaceful evolution" on our young generation. I swear to the Party: In the class struggle, I will always be a loyal little red soldier of Chairman Mao. My head can be cut off, my blood can flow, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned!

Let the Iron-Clad Mountains and Rivers Be Red Forever

I watched the blood-stained clay sculptures of "The Rent Collection Courtyard" with tears in my eyes, feeling extremely sad and excited. I am a young person from the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an. Today, in the capital of our great motherland, I once again received a profound class education. The dark old society, a human hell, it killed so many of our class brothers, so many families were separated, and so many homes were destroyed!

Today, under the leadership of our greatest leader Chairman Mao, our country is so powerful, and the mountains and rivers are so beautiful. This is what countless revolutionary martyrs have achieved by sacrificing their heads and shedding their blood. We must defend the iron-clad socialist mountains and rivers to keep them red forever!

		A student from Yan'an University

Carry the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat to the End

Before liberation, my parents suffered just like the poor peasants of Dayi County. My grandfather was bitten to death by a landlord's dog. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, my family was liberated. I will always be grateful to the Party and Chairman Mao. If it were not for liberation, how could a child from a poor peasant family like me come to Beijing?

When I go back, I will vigorously propagate and let everyone remember: It is the great leader Chairman Mao who led us onto the bright path.

When I go back, I will study Chairman Mao's works even more diligently, carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, and carry the socialist revolution to the end!

    不忘阶级仇　永做革命人
    ——革命小将谈《收租院》
    了解昔日苦　方知今日甜
    我怀着十分激愤的心情看完了泥塑《收租院》展览。我是解放以后出生的，没有受过旧社会的苦。看完了展览以后，我才真正看到了我国广大劳动人民在解放前过的是什么样的苦难生活。
    看旧社会的苦，我更知新社会的甜，我无限地热爱我们伟大的领袖毛主席。毛主席啊！我们永远听您的话，照您的指示办事，永远记住阶级仇恨，永远记住世界上还有三分之二的人民生活在水深火热之中。我们永远跟着您，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
                江西高安县一红卫兵
    决不让他们恢复“收租院”
    我们都是工人和贫下中农子女，今天参观了《收租院》泥塑展览，受到了一次深刻的阶级教育。我们的父兄在解放前受苦受难的情景，又一次展现在我们面前。我们痛恨万恶的旧社会和一切剥削制度。我们要继承父兄的意志，永远跟着党，跟着毛主席干革命，干到底。
    当前无产阶级文化大革命是一场尖锐的阶级斗争，被推翻的剥削阶级想变天，恢复他们的“收租院”，重新骑在劳动人民头上，这办不到！一千个办不到！一万个办不到！我们工人和贫下中农的子女要牢记血泪仇，不忘阶级苦，保卫无产阶级铁打的江山永不变色。

    “忘记过去就意味着背叛”
    温故而知新，忆苦而知甜。通过泥塑《收租院》这一堂活的阶级教育课，使我懂得了以前比吃讲穿、挑肥拣瘦是忘了本。忘记过去就意味着背叛。我是贫下中农的子弟，我一定要继承革命前辈的光荣传统，不忘阶级苦，永记血泪仇，读一辈子毛主席的书，干一辈子革命。

    有了毛主席才有幸福的今天
    看了《收租院》，使我联想起了我一家在万恶的农奴主统治时代的悲惨生活，我的爸爸妈妈都死在农奴主手里。我从七岁起就给农奴主当奴隶，过着牛马不如的生活。直到十四岁那年，党和毛主席才把我从黑暗里救出来。从此再不当农奴了，而且我们穷人有了上学的机会，今天我又是光荣的红卫兵。想想过去，想想今天，再看看这个泥塑展览，我明白，没有毛主席的领导，就没有我们农奴的今天，我就更加热爱毛主席。我要永远听毛主席的话，做一个毛主席的好学生，跟毛主席干一辈子革命！

    作毛主席的红小兵
    参观了泥塑《收租院》，在我的心里烧起了仇恨的火焰。我更加懂得了我国劳动人民过去受的苦，是由于帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三座大山的压迫。
    今天，混进党内走资本主义道路的当权派，竭力反对伟大的毛泽东思想，梦想在我们年轻一代身上搞“和平演变”。我向党宣誓：在阶级斗争中，永远作毛主席的忠实的红小兵。头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢！
                陕西西安市一红卫兵
    让铁打的江山万代红
    我含着眼泪看完了血泪斑斑的《收租院》泥塑群像，心中万分悲痛和激动。我是从革命圣地延安来的青年，今天，在伟大祖国的首都，又一次受到深刻的阶级教育。黑暗的旧社会，吃人的人间地狱，它逼死了我们多少阶级弟兄，多少人妻离子散，家破人亡！
    今天，在我们最最伟大的领袖毛主席领导下，我们的祖国如此强大，江山如此美好，这是千千万万革命先烈抛头颅洒热血换来的，我们一定要保住社会主义铁打江山万代红！
                    延安大学一学生
    把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    解放前，我的父母也如大邑县贫苦农民一样受尽了苦难，我爷爷就是被地主家的狗咬死的。在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我家才得到了解放。我永远要感谢党，感谢毛主席。要是在解放前，像我这样贫农家的孩子，怎么可能上北京呢？
    我回去后，要大力宣传，让大家都牢记：是伟大领袖毛主席，领导我们走上光明的大道。
    我回去后，要更努力地学习毛主席著作，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底！
