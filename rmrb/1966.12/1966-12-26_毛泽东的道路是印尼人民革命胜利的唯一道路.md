The Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization in Indonesia, in its statement supporting the struggle of Indonesian Chinese against persecution, pointed out that the road of Mao Zedong is the only path to victory for the Indonesian people's revolution. It is necessary to wage a people's war, establish rural base areas, rely on the peasant masses, and carry out a land revolution. A protracted war must be waged to achieve final victory.

The fascist regime of Suharto-Nasution, backed by the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists, will not last long and will definitely be buried by the Indonesian people.

New China News Agency, December 25th: The Secretary-General of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization in Indonesia, Ibrahim Isa, issued a statement on the 22nd, firmly supporting the struggle of Indonesian Chinese against persecution.

The statement said, we represent the Indonesian people who are bravely resisting the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime in the mountains, jungles, prisons, concentration camps, and other places. We pay high tribute to the Chinese residents in Indonesia, especially to the 41 Chinese youth who bravely and fearlessly resisted the bayonets and guns of the Indonesian fascists, fought tenaciously, and finally achieved a glorious victory. The heroic 41 Chinese youth, with their high spirit of heroism, upheld the honor of their great motherland and the great Chinese people. With unparalleled courage, they upheld the honor and dignity of the great teacher, great leader, and great helmsman of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao Zedong.

The statement pointed out that the rightist forces and fascists led by Suharto-Nasution have massacred tens of thousands of Indonesian Communist Party members and other progressive and democratic figures. With the instructions and cunning support of U.S. imperialism and the modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership, they launched a large-scale persecution and massacre campaign against the Chinese residents in Indonesia. This brutal and shameful anti-China movement aims to defame China and sever diplomatic relations between the two countries.

The statement revealed that the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime, in gross violation of the most basic norms of international relations, organized thugs and hooligans, with the help of Chiang Kai-shek's agents, to attack the Consulate General and Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia. They shamelessly looted the houses of the Chinese diplomatic mission, trampled on the national emblem of the People's Republic of China, and tore down the national flag of the People's Republic of China. They burned and looted the property of the embassy, beat and insulted the embassy staff, and even shot and wounded a staff member of the Chinese Embassy. At the same time, in various parts of Indonesia, especially in Aceh, North Sumatra, South Sumatra, West Java, Central Java, East Java, South Sulawesi, Bali, and Lombok, the Indonesian fascists kidnapped, looted, expelled, beat, arrested, and massacred many Chinese residents, looted and burned their property. They were driven to "concentration camps" and completely deprived of their livelihood. Recently, the Indonesian fascists are stepping up the movement to "expel" Chinese residents from Indonesia.

The statement said, we Indonesian revolutionaries and the entire Indonesian people are determined to settle accounts with the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime and to reckon with them for their savage persecution of the Indonesian people and your compatriots.

The statement solemnly declared that the despicable criminals Suharto-Nasution and all their accomplices and supporters must remember: blood debts must be repaid with blood! You will not escape the punishment that history and the Indonesian people will surely give you. Even with the support of U.S. imperialism and the modern revisionism led by the cunning Soviet Communist Party leadership, your rule will not last long. You have put the noose around your own necks with your actions. The Indonesian people will definitely overthrow you. The Indonesian people will definitely hang you. You will definitely be buried by the flames of the people's war that will soon engulf the entire Indonesia. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The various persecutions inflicted by the reactionaries on the revolutionary people will, in the long run, only promote a broader and more intense revolution. All the reactionaries' attempts are to try to suppress the revolution by slaughter. They think that the more people they kill, the smaller the revolution will be. But contrary to this reactionary subjective desire, the fact is that the more people the reactionaries kill, the greater the revolutionary force will be, and the closer the reactionaries will be to their doom. This is an irresistible law."

The statement said, the fate of the Chinese residents in Indonesia and the Indonesian people is closely linked. We have shared joys and sorrows together. The Chinese residents have lived in Indonesia for generations, establishing an unbreakable friendship with the Indonesian people. They have made significant contributions to the prosperity of the Indonesian state and people. The Chinese residents have also actively participated in the Indonesian people's struggle against colonialism and against the imperialism of the Netherlands, Britain, and Japan, and in the war for independence. The friendship between the Indonesian people and the great Chinese people is built on blood. Our unshakable fighting friendship and unity are unbreakable by anyone.

The statement said, the victory of the Chinese residents in Indonesia in their struggle against the Indonesian fascists has given us Indonesian revolutionaries immense inspiration. Your victory is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. You have been nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought. You have practiced the teachings of Chairman Mao: "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, and overcoming all difficulties, strive for victory." Under the inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, you bravely faced the risks, resolutely resisted the bayonets and guns of the Indonesian fascists, and fought a heroic battle. We Indonesian revolutionaries are deeply inspired by your courage and heroism. The Indonesian people have drawn great lessons and strength from your brave resistance. Your victory is the victory of the Indonesian people.

The statement emphasized that the Indonesian people, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, have also drawn lessons from the white terror imposed by Suharto-Nasution. We have resolved that we must be more modest, more diligent, and more serious in learning Mao Zedong Thought, this most advanced, most complete, and most comprehensive revolutionary theory of our time, which has been brilliantly developed by Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong teaches us that we must fully recognize this truth: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Chairman Mao teaches us that without a people's army, there is nothing for the people. We are more convinced than ever that the Indonesian people must overthrow the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime by following the path indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong, and there is no other way.

The statement pointed out that the road of Mao Zedong is the only path to revolutionary victory for the Indonesian people. To establish a people's democratic government, we must wage a people's war, establish rural revolutionary base areas, wage a protracted war, rely on the peasant masses, and carry out a land revolution. We must realize the principle of self-reliance in the struggle, unite all forces that can be united, encircle the cities, and seize final victory. We must abandon and thoroughly eliminate all illusions about the "peaceful road" advocated by modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership, all revisionist "theories," and all other erroneous ideas, including blind reliance on the bourgeoisie, etc. We must implement Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings to us: "Use revolutionary war to oppose counter-revolutionary war."

The statement said, internationally, we should more closely unite with the People's Republic of China, more firmly defend this vanguard of the world revolution and the strongest and most reliable fortress of the revolutionary people of the world. We must defend and enthusiastically learn the most precious treasure and beacon of the revolutionary people of the world, Mao Zedong Thought, and enthusiastically act according to Mao Zedong Thought. We must more closely unite with all revolutionary forces in the world, unreservedly support them, and persistently struggle against and expose the imperialists led by U.S. imperialism and the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership.

The statement said, the path of struggle that the Indonesian people must take is not an easy one. It is filled with various obstacles and difficulties. This path is not smooth but very arduous and tortuous. It is a path that we need to endure for a long time. Through this path indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong and illuminated by the great Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely overcome all difficulties. The Indonesian fascists will definitely be buried by the Indonesian people! Final victory will definitely belong to the Indonesian people. As long as we faithfully adhere to the road of Mao Zedong, we will undoubtedly achieve one victory after another. The future of the Indonesian people is very bright.

The statement concluded that the Indonesian people are extremely grateful for the solidarity shown by the Chinese residents in Indonesia. In the past, especially now when our struggle is facing temporary difficulties, the great People's Republic of China and the great Chinese people have given various sincere and unconditional support and assistance to the struggle of the Indonesian people. For this, the Indonesian people express their deepest gratitude. But what we are most grateful for is that we have been given Mao Zedong Thought, the most effective weapon to defeat all reactionaries.

    印尼亚非人民团结组织在支持印尼华侨反迫害斗争的声明中指出
    毛泽东的道路是印尼人民革命胜利的唯一道路
    必须进行人民战争，建立农村根据地，依靠农民群众和进行土地革命，开展持久战，夺取最后胜利
    在美帝苏修支持下的苏哈托——纳苏蒂安法西斯政权的统治不会长久，肯定要被印尼人民埋葬掉
    新华社二十五日讯　印度尼西亚亚非人民团结组织秘书长伊卜拉欣·伊萨在二十二日发表声明，坚决支持印尼华侨的反迫害斗争。
    声明说，我们代表正在山区、丛林、监狱、死亡营及其它地方同苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权进行艰苦抵抗的印尼人民，向住在印尼的华侨致以崇高的敬意，特别是向曾经英勇和毫不畏惧地抵抗印尼法西斯主义者的刺刀和枪杆、同他们进行顽强斗争并最后取得光辉胜利的四十一名华侨青少年致以崇高的敬意。英勇的四十一名华侨青少年，以高度英雄主义的精神，维护了他们伟大祖国和伟大中国人民的荣誉。他们以无比的英勇气概，维护了中国人民和全世界革命人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖和伟大舵手毛泽东主席的荣誉和尊严。
    声明指出，以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印尼右派势力和法西斯分子，杀害了成千上万的印尼共产党员及其他进步分子和民主人士，并在美帝国主义的指使和阴险的以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的祝福和全力支持下，对印尼的华侨发动了一场大规模的迫害和屠杀运动。这场粗暴和可耻的反华运动，旨在诬蔑中国和断绝两国的外交关系。
    声明揭露说，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权粗暴地违反国际关系最基本的准则，组织暴徒和流氓，在蒋介石特务的帮助下，袭击中华人民共和国在印尼的领事馆和大使馆，肆无忌惮地抢劫中国外交使团的房子，践踏中华人民共和国的国徽和扯下中华人民共和国的国旗，烧毁和抢劫大使馆的财产，殴打和侮辱大使馆的工作人员，甚至开枪打伤中国大使馆的一名工作人员。与此同时，在印尼各地，尤其在亚齐、北苏门答腊、南苏门答腊、西爪哇、中爪哇、东爪哇、南苏拉威西、巴厘和龙目，印尼法西斯分子绑架、抢劫、驱逐、殴打、逮捕和屠杀了许多华侨，抢劫和烧毁了他们的财产。他们被赶往“集中营”，完全被剥夺了生计。最近，印尼法西斯分子正在加紧进行“驱逐”华侨出印尼的运动。
    声明说，我们印尼革命者和全体印尼人民，决心要和苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权算账，清算他们对印尼人民和贵国华侨的罪恶和野蛮的迫害。
    声明庄严地宣告说，可耻的罪犯苏哈托—纳苏蒂安以及一切帮凶和支持者们必须记住：血债必须用血来还！你们决逃避不了历史和印尼人民肯定会给予的惩罚。甚至在美帝国主义和以阴险的苏共领导集团为首的现代修正主义的支持下，你们的统治也不会长久的。你们以自己的行动把绞索套在自己的脖子上。印尼人民一定会推翻你们。印尼人民一定要把你们拖上绞架。你们一定会被即将燃遍整个印尼的人民战争的烈火所埋葬。毛泽东同志说：各国反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”“一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。这是一条不可抗拒的法则。”
    声明说，印尼的华侨和印尼人民的命运是紧密地联结在一起的。我们曾在一起同甘苦，共患难。华侨世世代代生活在印尼，同印尼人民建立了牢不可破的友谊。他们对印尼国家和人民的繁荣作出了不少的贡献。华侨还积极地参加了印尼人民反对殖民主义和反对荷兰、英国和日本帝国主义、争取独立的战争。印尼人民和伟大的中国人民的友谊是用鲜血建立起来的。我们坚如磐石的战斗友谊和团结，是任何人也破坏不了的。
    声明说，在印尼的华侨反对印尼法西斯分子斗争的胜利，给了我们印尼革命者以无比的鼓舞。你们的胜利是毛泽东思想的胜利。你们受到了伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育。你们实践了毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”在毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，你们勇敢地经历了风险，坚决地抵抗了印尼法西斯分子的刺刀和枪杆，进行了英勇的斗争。我们印尼革命者深深地为你们的勇敢和英雄主义所鼓舞。印尼人民从你们的英勇抵抗中吸取了重大的教训和力量。你们的胜利是印尼人民的胜利。
    声明强调说，印尼人民在印尼共产党的领导下，也从苏哈托—纳苏蒂安所实行的白色恐怖中吸取了教训。我们已经下决心，我们必须更谦虚、更用功、更认真地学习毛泽东思想这一被毛泽东同志天才地发展了的当代最先进、最完整和最全面的革命理论。毛泽东同志教导我们必须充分认识这样一个真理：“枪杆子里面出政权”。毛主席教导我们，没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。我们比任何时候都更坚信，印尼人民要推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权，除了遵循毛泽东同志所指出的道路以外，别的道路是没有的。
    声明指出，毛泽东的道路是印尼人民取得革命胜利唯一的道路。为了建立人民民主政权，我们必须进行人民战争，在农村建立革命根据地，开展持久战，依靠农民群众和进行土地革命，实现斗争中的自力更生原则，团结一切可以团结的力量，包围城市并夺取最后胜利。我们必须丢掉和彻底消除对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义所宣扬的“和平道路”的一切幻想，一切修正主义的“理论”以及所有其他错误的思想，包括盲目地依靠资产阶级等等。我们必须实现毛泽东同志对我们的教导：“用革命战争反对反革命战争”。
    声明说，在国际方面，我们应该更紧密地和中华人民共和国团结起来，更加坚定地保卫这个世界革命的旗手和全世界革命人民最强大和最可靠的堡垒。我们必须捍卫和热情学习世界革命人民的最宝贵的财富和灯塔毛泽东思想，热情地按毛泽东思想办事。我们必须和世界上一切革命力量更加紧密地团结起来，毫无保留地支持他们，坚持不懈地对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者进行斗争并揭露他们。
    声明说，印尼人民所必须走上的斗争道路不是一条容易的道路。它充满着各种障碍和困难。这条道路不是平坦的，而是十分艰难曲折的。它是一条我们需要长期经历的道路。通过走这一条毛泽东同志所指引的、伟大的毛泽东思想所照耀的道路，我们一定会克服各种困难。印尼的法西斯分子肯定会被印尼人民埋葬掉！最后胜利一定属于印尼人民。只要我们忠实地坚持毛泽东的道路，我们无疑地将取得一个又一个的胜利，印尼人民的前途是十分光明的。
    声明最后说，印度尼西亚人民极为感谢在印尼的华侨们对他们所表示的团结。过去，特别是现在正当我们的斗争处于暂时困难时，伟大的中华人民共和国和伟大的中国人民给予印度尼西亚人民的斗争以各种真诚的无条件的支持和援助。对此，印度尼西亚人民表示最为深切的谢意。但是我们最为感激的是我们被赋予了毛泽东思想这一战胜一切反动派的最有效的武器。
