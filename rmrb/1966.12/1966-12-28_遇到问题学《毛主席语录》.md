A freedom fighter from Azania (South Africa) discovered during his visit to China that from Beijing to Jinggangshan, from young Red Guards to the elderly, whenever they encounter problems at work, face difficulties in struggle, or have differing opinions during discussions, they all take out "Chairman Mao's Quotations" to find answers. After returning, he was deeply moved and said, "This is the best way to study Chairman Mao's works and quotations."

Since then, he always carries an English version of "Chairman Mao's Quotations" with him. Whenever he encounters problems, he reads from it to find solutions. Now he has memorized many quotations from Chairman Mao, and he can recite a few of them word for word. He said, "When I think about the struggle at home, I recall, 'Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of primary importance in the revolution.' When I encounter difficulties, the image of the old man moving mountains appears before my eyes."

    遇到问题学《毛主席语录》
    一位阿扎尼亚（南非）自由战士在访问中国时发现，从北京到井冈山，从年轻的红卫兵到老人，每当他们在工作中碰到问题，在斗争中碰到困难，或在讨论中意见不一致的时候，他们都拿出《毛主席语录》，从中找寻答案。他回来之后十分感动地说：“这是学习毛主席著作和语录的最好方法。”
    从此以后，他总是带着一本英文版本的《毛主席语录》，遇到问题就读一读，从中寻找解决办法。现在他记住了好多条毛主席语录，有几条已经能一字一句地背诵了。他说，当我考虑国内斗争时，我就想起，“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”当我遇到困难时，老愚公的形象就出现在我的眼前。
