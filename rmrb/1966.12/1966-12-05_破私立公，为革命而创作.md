Edition: 2

The song of Ou Yanghai is an excellent novel since the founding of the country. It demonstrates the boundless power of great Mao Zedong Thought in nurturing and creating new communist people. It shows that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the correct leadership of the Central Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao, has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, insisted on the Four Firsts, promoted the Three-Eights style, and launched the movement to create excellent companies. This novel, once published, was warmly welcomed by a wide readership and has become an excellent material for propagating and learning Mao Zedong Thought. The success of The Song of Ou Yanghai is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought; the success of The Song of Ou Yanghai shows that socialist literature and art can only create heroic images armed with Mao Zedong Thought to possess great vitality.

How can one write such an excellent work as The Song of Ou Yanghai? Comrade Jin Jingmai, the author, vividly answers this question with his personal experience: the most fundamental thing is to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's soul and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's direction for literature and art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Comrade Jin Jingmai follows Chairman Mao's teachings and honestly transforms his thoughts in the army, this great school of Mao Zedong Thought. He constantly uses Mao Zedong Thought to examine himself, find his goals, and constantly learns from the soldiers to find the gaps in his thoughts. In the struggle to transform his soul, he bravely breaks private interests and establishes public spirit. He deeply feels that "to write revolutionary literature, one must first become a revolutionary."

Comrade Jin Jingmai follows Chairman Mao's teachings and resolutely goes to the fiery struggle, to the company, this great furnace, and lives, studies, works, and trains with the soldiers. He rolls around with them, becomes familiar with the soldiers and life, and gains the source of creation.

In the process of creating this novel, Comrade Jin Jingmai deeply feels that only by taking great Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, relying on the Party, relying on the masses, and taking the "three-in-one combination" road, can one become infinitely wise and complete the task of creation. Comrade Jin Jingmai's experience of breaking private interests, establishing public spirit, transforming thoughts, and creating for the revolution is worth every revolutionary literature and art worker studying seriously.

The following is an excerpt from Comrade Jin Jingmai's speech at the Guangzhou Military Region's Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works.

Creating cannot be done with personal motives; public and private interests cannot coexist.

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Fundamentally, it is a revolution to transform people's souls, a revolution to break private interests and establish public spirit. Private interests are the roots of all exploitative class consciousness over thousands of years; public interests are the concentrated expression of proletarian thought. Public and private interests are fundamentally opposed, incompatible like water and fire, and cannot coexist. The struggle between public and private interests is a life-and-death struggle between two classes and two roads. This truth I did not understand before. I always wanted to add some personal motives to my revolutionary work, wanting to achieve "balancing public and private interests," or at least "public first, private second." I did not understand that one should strive for selflessness. On this issue, I took many detours.

Before the end of 1960, I was in the drama troupe's acting team. When acting, the question of whether to act for public or private interests was fiercely struggling in my mind. Acting for public or private interests is about why one lives. This question everyone must answer. At that time, I answered it like this: generally, I live for the revolution, but it would be best to live comfortably, endure less hardship, and achieve something extraordinary. In fact, this was just dressing up my bourgeois worldview with the words "for the revolution." With such a worldview, I preferred to act in leading roles because acting in leading roles could achieve "something extraordinary." As for performing in big cities or in companies, I preferred performing in big cities because it was more comfortable there. Although at that time I mainly acted in minor roles, did lighting, and moved scenery, and although I was praised for these tasks, my heart yearned for leading roles. My voice was not good, and my appearance was not good either. The director would not assign me the task of portraying positive heroic characters, at most letting me play a "Spy A" or "Bandit B" with about ten lines of dialogue. I thought to myself: "With my level, am I to do this every day?" Public and private interests cannot be balanced, and I was secretly troubled. I wanted to find some other job to display my "talent."

At the end of 1960, the organization assigned me to the creation group to learn writing. I was very happy because creative work does not require a good voice or good appearance, and there is no distinction between leading and supporting roles. I made up my mind to strive for a breath of fresh air and quickly write some works to show my "extraordinariness." On the surface, it was creating for the revolution, but in reality, it was mixed with personal motives.

As a creator, one must go to the army to experience life. My first feeling was that this was even more tiring than acting. The scorching life has tempered so many good soldiers of Chairman Mao! However, with my worldview of "living comfortably," it became a hard job. Therefore, although I lived with the soldiers, my mind was on quickly gathering some materials to go back and write plays. I did not stay long and wanted to change places, never thinking that I should seriously transform myself in life. Not being down-to-earth and thorough in life, I could not truly understand the reality of our army. When I returned to the team and picked up my pen to quickly write a work to show my extraordinary self, my mind was empty, and I could not write anything.

Mao Zedong Thought is fundamentally opposed to private ownership and all exploitative class consciousness. "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." If the private interests are not destroyed, the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought cannot be mastered. Chairman Mao repeatedly taught us revolutionary literature and art workers, "You must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, to the fiery struggle, to the only vast and rich source, ... and then you can enter the creative process." My life like a dragonfly skimming the water's surface and interviewing like a horse racing past flowers was fundamentally against Chairman Mao's teachings. With personal motives, I was afraid of hardship and fatigue, how could I thoroughly and unconditionally immerse myself in life? Not following Chairman Mao's teachings, of course, I could not enter the creative process, and of course, I could not write anything.

When I was learning to write, it was the time when the Military Commission's Enlarged Meeting's "Resolution on Strengthening Political and Ideological Work in the Army" was issued. The entire army was vigorously promoting Mao Zedong Thought. This was such a good opportunity! When I was learning to create, the Party pointed out the way forward so clearly, asking me to follow the correct direction indicated by Chairman Mao. However, because the "private" in my mind was not destroyed, I still took many detours.

Grasping the transformation of worldview is the fundamental way to do everything well.

Chairman Mao said: "Among all things in the world, people are the most precious." Doing revolution relies on people, and doing everything well relies on highlighting the human factor. Creative work is no exception. To do creative work well, one must use Mao Zedong Thought to educate, transform, and arm the creators. If one does not grasp the transformation of one's worldview, one cannot talk about completing the creative tasks assigned by the Party.

Previously, in my creation, I wanted to achieve so-called "balancing public and private interests," which in essence was an attempt to let bourgeois individualism exist secretly and legally. I did not have the correct understanding of this mistake at that time. I attributed my inability to write works to my writing skills not being solid enough. I thought: if my writing skills were very proficient, even if I did not spend a long time in life, I would quickly be able to create something.

At the end of 1962, the communiqu√© of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was issued, and our most beloved leader Chairman Mao once again emphasized the theory of contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society. The severe reality of class struggle shocked me. The creation of themes not reflecting reality, superficial life experience, and emphasis on improving skills were not my creations but were advocated by the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Zhou Yang. It was the fallacious theory spread by class enemies to mislead revolutionary literature and art workers and to change Chairman Mao's literary line. Its existence and spread showed the severity of class struggle. With private interests, one would deviate from the correct direction indicated by Chairman Mao; with private interests, one would be captured by class enemies. If one did not turn back, it would not be a matter of taking detours and falling down but would be falling into the quagmire of bourgeois literary line and becoming a criminal of the revolution. The harm of private interests was so great. Whether to transform one's thoughts or not was a matter of whether one could continue the revolution. I could not be deluded any longer.

At this time, reading Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" again, the feeling was quite different. Chairman Mao had warned in the "Talks" that intellectuals engaged in literature and art must "change their thoughts and feelings, undergo a transformation. Without this change, without this transformation, nothing can be done well, everything will be out of place." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, with the initial desire to transform myself, I went deep into life again. It was like entering a brand-new world.

The following spring, the deeds of Comrade Lei Feng and the Eighth Company were publicized. The army, taking Comrade Lei Feng and the Eighth Company as examples, launched a new high tide of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. The broad cadre and soldiers further armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and good people and good deeds were everywhere. There was a soldier who had just joined the army, a young man from a minority. He was illiterate and usually spoke very little, seeming not to understand any principles. When he studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune," his family wrote a letter to pull him back. This soldier covered the cover of Chairman Mao's works with paper and wrote his first letter in his life like copying red characters. The whole letter had only one sentence: I am serving the people. But these seven words, each word shone with gold! Although this little soldier knew few principles, he understood the most fundamental principle, and on the question of why one lives, he understood more and was stronger than me. There was also a quartermaster. When a comrade's family was in difficulty, he sent ten yuan from his salary at once, but when buying matches for the mess hall, he did not buy the two-fen-per-box matches from the nearby shop but went an extra ten miles to the service society to buy them. Because the service society's matches were five fen for three boxes. He thought: serving the people, what's the big deal about walking an extra ten miles? One box of matches can save the company three fen and three cents! Walking an extra ten miles would of course be more tiring, but he considered the collective, the people. What weight these three fen and three cents had! This was our soldier, this was our great reality. Since Comrade Lin Biao called on us to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, the army has produced such a batch of new people: they knew few principles before joining the army, but after coming to the revolutionary army, the first article they learned was "In Memory of Norman Bethune." But they learned one sentence and used one sentence, did what Chairman Mao said, and did it exactly as Chairman Mao said. Towards Chairman Mao's instructions, they truly did one hundred percent loyally. These were new communist people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They were following Chairman Mao's teachings, advancing towards the great goal of becoming "an honorable person, a pure person, a person with morality, a person who has shed low-level interests, a person who benefits the people."

Comparing these ordinary soldiers with myself, I was far behind! In life, there are always these two kinds of people, both nominally doing the revolution: one kind of person is selfless, thinking of others, the collective, the Party, and the people's interests in everything; one kind of person always cannot give up the private interests, thinking that selflessness is "losing out," just as Chairman Mao criticized: "When faced with something, think for yourself first, then for others." One kind of person is selfless, open and upright, and feels sweet even when enduring hardship; one kind of person is always calculating his own small account, living unhappily. Comparing with revolutionary soldiers, every matter made me feel ashamed. It was only at this time that I began to understand that I should use the "Three Articles" to transform my worldview.

Why did I awaken so late? When I first joined the army, there was a plaque at the camp gate with Chairman Mao's calligraphy: "Serve the People." For more than a decade, I often learned and often talked about it, but why did I still learn it badly and use it badly? The root cause was the issue of class stance and class feelings.

I came from a petty-bourgeois family and lived a life of "economic self-sufficiency." Although I was not satisfied with the old society, I did not urgently "need a revolution to change the status quo." After liberation, joining the revolution, my political status and economic life underwent fundamental changes. However, for me, liberation or not was a matter of hunger and cold versus warmth and fullness, while for the broad masses of workers and peasants, liberation or not was a matter of life and death. Hunger and cold versus warmth and fullness were different from life and death. It was determined by class status, it was a brand, it was the basis of class consciousness. It could determine your attitude towards the democratic revolution and also affect your attitude towards the socialist revolution. The socialist revolution was to break private interests and establish public spirit. The most powerful weapon to break private interests and establish public spirit was Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, the attitude towards the socialist revolution was also the attitude towards breaking private interests and establishing public spirit, which was concentrated in the attitude towards learning Chairman Mao's works. I loved Chairman Mao, but compared to comrades from worker and peasant backgrounds, I did not love him as deeply. I believed in Mao Zedong Thought, but I was not as loyal as the worker and peasant masses. My feelings were not as deep as the worker and peasant masses, so my learning of Chairman Mao's works was far from as conscious and good as the soldiers'. To eliminate the private interests in one's thoughts, one must study Chairman Mao's works thoroughly, and not put the private interests in a position to be beaten and fought, otherwise one could not learn Chairman Mao's works well.

Comrade Lin Biao said: Our proletarian literature and art are "a tool to propagate Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in an image and popular way." Without fighting against private interests and thoroughly transforming one's soul with Mao Zedong Thought, how could one write literary and art works to propagate Mao Zedong Thought? Some bourgeois writers, their skills were not low, but could they write works to praise Mao Zedong Thought? Politics is the commander, the soul. The reason I could not write works was not a matter of skills, but a lack of politics, a lack of firm thoughts. The fundamental of creative work, like all other revolutionary work, was to learn Chairman Mao's works thoroughly, to revolutionize one's thoughts, to grasp the transformation of worldview.

The best classroom for transformation is among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, in the fiery struggle.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Our literature and art workers must complete this task, must move their standpoints over, must in the process of deeply immersing themselves in the workers, peasants, and soldiers, in the actual struggle, in the process of learning Marxism and learning society, gradually move over, move to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, move to the side of the proletariat. Only in this way can we have true literature and art for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, true proletarian literature and art." Chairman Mao's words are truly correct. Take the example of saving three fen and three cents with one box of matches, standing from the standpoint of individualism, it was considered a losing deal, only by moving the standpoint to the side of the proletariat, one could feel that this spirit was great, worthy of learning, worthy of propagating through art forms. Without humbly learning from the soldiers, without breaking private interests and establishing public spirit, without first becoming a revolutionary, one could not write revolutionary literature and art works. I was a creator in the army and should humbly go to the army, be a student of the soldiers. I had the thought of fearing hardship and fatigue, only by being with the selfless soldiers, following their learning of the "Three Articles," under their help and supervision, could I promote my thought transformation.

I felt that soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought were the most selfless and simple, and the best classroom for intellectuals to transform themselves was among them. In the company, one could be educated everywhere. There was a duty, no matter how tired, everyone competed to do it. During rest time and holidays, everyone rushed to do good deeds. Going to the mess hall to help with cooking, if you went late, there was no work for you. These were small things, but every matter attacked my "private interests," every matter made me feel that public interests were great and private interests were shameful. At first, I forced myself to learn to do it, and doing it became a habit. When it was time to watch a movie, I volunteered to stay behind to guard the house; when guarding the house, I did not forget to hang the mosquito nets for the comrades and prepare a few basins of water for them to wash their feet when they returned. These were the most minor labors, as long as you thought of the collective, you would do it consciously. Doing it, the soldiers would treat you as a family member, take care of you without missing a detail, and talk to you without holding back; in return, it deepened your class feelings for the soldiers. After a period of time, I felt that such a life was much happier than my original life, although it was a bit hard and tiring, but my heart was very steady, and everything was comfortable.

Of course, the transformation of intellectuals was not easy, and without working hard to undergo long-term tempering, it was not enough. Once, during a field training exercise in the army, we walked continuously for two days and one night, covering more than two hundred miles, and my feet were blistered several times, each step was very painful. I knew this was a test of revolutionary will. I had the thought of fearing hardship and fatigue, and this was precisely the time to work hard on the "use" aspect and fight against the thought of fearing hardship and fatigue. Walking and walking, two thoughts fiercely struggled in my mind. The correct thought said: you must listen to Chairman Mao's words: in times of difficulty, you must see achievements, see light, and raise our courage. We have already walked more than two hundred miles, this is an achievement, and we are about to complete the task of rushing, this is light, persevering to the end is victory. The backward thought said: field training for me, tempering the soles of my feet was secondary, the main thing was to experience the soldiers' thoughts and feelings during the rush, we had already walked so far, the comrades' firm will during the rush had been basically experienced, besides, I really could not walk anymore, tempering should be done slowly. These two thoughts, who would win, was not clear, the company commander saw me limping and advised me to stay by the road to wait for the car, I thought of my task of transformation and tempering, gritted my teeth and did not do it. I could have persevered like this. Just at this time, a car honked past me, but I moved. I thought, in the city, which time going out was not by car, not by car then by bicycle. This was not a real battle, the actual meaning of persevering to the end was not great. This thought came out, my feet also hurt more, and the things on my back also became heavier. Soon, another small car came up from behind and stopped in front of me, the leader shouted, "Old Jin, get on the car!" I hesitated for a few words and finally got on. In fact, there were only about twenty miles ahead, I was only an hour earlier than the troops. That one hour! The feeling of discomfort in my heart was indescribable, until the comrades all fell asleep, my mind was still in turmoil. I thought: sitting on such a short car ride, and it was the leader who called me to sit, usually I would not regard it as a flaw, nor would it cause any thought struggle. But next to me were soldiers who persevered to the end, compared to them, it tested my attitude towards thought transformation too weakly. The last twenty miles was an exam, for me, and also for the soldiers, it gave a report: it reported that the soldiers were truly fearless heroes, I was only a dwarf in action. From this incident, I once again found the gap between myself and the soldiers. Was it that I was not as strong as them in physical strength? No! Although I was not as good as them in physical strength, the more important thing was that my thoughts were not as firm as theirs, my proletarian consciousness was not as high as theirs, and I was not as fierce as them in the "use" aspect. Individualism was a very stubborn fortress, it could find various "reasons" to numb you, if you could not hate it, you would definitely lose. In the "use" aspect, it was to use Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely fight against one's non-proletarian thoughts, first to hate non-proletarian thoughts, to hate individualism. Only by hating it could you fight it, and only by hating it fiercely could you fight it fiercely. Not fighting was not an option, and fighting without fierceness was also not an option. This time I suffered the loss of fighting without fierceness. Learning from this lesson, later when I lived in the army, my requirements for myself were stricter.

Another incident happened during another field training exercise. One day, the higher-ups stipulated that we must arrive at the designated camping place before dawn at five o'clock. It happened to be a day of heavy rain, slippery roads, and pitch-black darkness, nothing could be seen. When it was almost five o'clock, we still could not find the camping village, everyone was very anxious. I suddenly vaguely heard the sound of dogs barking, and immediately ran towards the direction of the barking with a few comrades from the communications platoon. We fell several times, covered in mud and water, but finally led the troops into the village on time. After dividing the rooms, the company commander saw that I was soaked from head to toe and told me to quickly take off my cotton-padded clothes to dry them. At that time, I was shivering from the cold, so I really dried my cotton-padded clothes. While drying, I also thought: today was not bad, I did not surrender to the thought of fearing hardship and fatigue. But looking back, those soldiers who fell and were covered in mud and water like me, none of them were drying their cotton-padded clothes, each of them took advantage of the dim light to draw water for the villagers. The day before we set out, I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with them and made a resolution together. In my opinion, the task of marching was done well, I did propaganda work all the way, and even helped a new comrade carry the gun for a while, persevered to the end, not to mention leading the troops to the camping place on time, I also led the way. I could be considered to have completely and thoroughly served the people. But the soldiers? They thought of the people's interests, thought of the rain and slippery roads making it inconvenient for the people to draw water, thought of the glorious tradition of the troops, but precisely forgot that their cotton-padded clothes were wet, forgot their own cold and fatigue. This incident gave me a great education, what was called "completely" and "thoroughly"? Awareness was different, the depth of understanding was also different.

Learning Chairman Mao's works, perhaps one could not see the difference between us at first, but how to work hard on the "use" aspect could immediately reveal a comrade's high or low level of proletarian consciousness. Awareness was high, use was better, awareness was low, use was worse. This was the fundamental reason why, when talking about revolutionary principles, I was not much different from the soldiers, but when it came to action, I was far behind them.

Learning the "Three Articles" with the soldiers and discussing learning experiences with the soldiers, I felt that each soldier was my teacher. I became more and more clear about the great power of invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Our soldiers were mostly from the countryside, they were ordinary laborers. After coming to the army for a short few years, a short few months, they actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, once armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they could move mountains and fill seas, change heaven and earth, and create any miracle in the world. Their selfless and dedicated communist style, their lofty quality of serving the people wholeheartedly, their hard-nosed style of daring to climb mountains and leap into fires for revolutionary interests, their revolutionary spirit of facing death fearlessly, all came from the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao said: "To make literature and art become a true part of the entire revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy." The most powerful weapon to unite the people and educate the people was the great Mao Zedong Thought; the most powerful weapon to attack the enemy and annihilate the enemy was the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Imperialism and all reactionaries, rely on people armed with Mao Zedong Thought to overthrow them; the private ownership concepts and all exploitative class consciousness left over from thousands of years, rely on Mao Zedong Thought to overcome. In a word, propagating Mao Zedong Thought was the highest task of our proletarian literary and art warriors. At this time, I had a strong desire to sing the praises of the great Mao Zedong Thought, to sing the praises of the new communist people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

It was in the winter of that year that I was living in the army when Ou Yanghai's heroic deed of sacrificing himself to save the train occurred. According to the instructions of the army leaders, I immediately transferred to the army where Ou Yanghai had served to live. The leaders of the army and his former comrades-in-arms told me many vivid deeds of the martyr. Comrade Ou Yanghai was a more comprehensive and great communist soldier than any soldier I had ever encountered. Every deed he did was like a political class, a class education class, a class on how to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works.

In 1962, Ou Yanghai visited his hometown. At that time, he had been away from home for four years. His brother was the team leader and had some problems in his work. The first words Ou Yanghai said to his brother were: "You have forgotten your roots!" I thought, if I also had a brother, in such a situation, what would I do? I would definitely ask about his health first and then criticize. This was not wrong. But look at Ou Yanghai, his attitude towards the struggle between the two roads, his attitude towards mistakes was so clear! Without strong class feelings, one could not do this.

Another example was Ou Yanghai's repair of the culvert. That day, it was raining heavily, and I passed by that culvert, which was on a simple road that no one ever noticed. On such a simple road, doing such ordinary labor, Ou Yanghai carefully carved "doing revolution" on the culvert. I stood in the rain for a long time, feeling uncomfortable for a long time. I was originally an actor, now I do creation, often representing the army leaders to visit, often having to transform people's souls. This was such an important job! Towards such an important job, I had not connected it with doing revolution so tightly, had not regarded ordinary labor, hard work, and culverts that no one knew about as bricks and tiles of the socialist building. Some people loved socialism because socialism had no exploitation and oppression, and were willing to forget themselves for socialism; some people loved socialism only because socialism would make their lives better and better. This was worldview. What was it to live extraordinarily? Truly understanding revolution was extraordinary. Looking at the culvert, I felt that my soul was deeply touched.

A son of a poor peasant, in his short twenty-three years of life, what power made him do so many beneficial things for the people in his daily work, what power made him produce such earth-shaking heroic deeds in a critical moment? It was the great Mao Zedong Thought! From Ou Yanghai, I also thought of the ordinary and great soldiers I had encountered in the army over the years. "Doing revolution" was not the same as the seven-character letter of that minority soldier! These most simple and common words were not the words I had heard in countless soldiers' discussions of the "Three Articles," not the words I had seen in the soldiers' notebooks of learning Chairman Mao's works? Thinking of this, the scattered good deeds I had observed and experienced in the army over the years were strung together; those originally seemingly ordinary good deeds became very tall and vivid; those deeds and words of the cadres and soldiers that I could not remember clearly now came alive in my mind. I had not seen Ou Yanghai, but I seemed to have studied Chairman Mao's works with him, picked tea seeds, and repaired railways with him. He was not unfamiliar to me. It was through the study of Chairman Mao's works that I became familiar with him, understood him, and initially understood his great life. Not only Ou Yanghai, at this time, the fictional characters in the novel: Zhang Wuming, Guan Yingkui, Xiao Wei, Xiao Liu, Gao Yizhong, etc., also gradually came together and came alive in my mind from this company, that battalion, from south to north.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said so well! Life, "is the inexhaustible and boundless source of all literature and art." If it were not for following Chairman Mao's teachings, going into life to shed a few drops of sweat, I would be comfortably editing in the house, what kind of thing could I concoct? If it were not for Mao Zedong Thought enlightening my eyes, what could I see in life? If it were not for taking the soldiers as examples, learning the "Three Articles" and fiercely fighting against private interests, how could I understand the selfless communist soldiers? From the bottom of my heart, not just a thousand times, ten thousand times, I wanted to shout long live Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

Breaking private interests, establishing the spirit of creating for the revolution, only then can one dare to be first.

I did not learn Chairman Mao's works well, my thoughts were not firm, and I was a new creator in the soldiers' drama troupe, my life and skills were also not solid. Previously, I had not even successfully written a one-act play alone, let alone written or thought of writing a novel. Suddenly accepting the task of creating a long novel, I truly felt that there were many difficulties and did not know where to start. But thinking of singing the praises of Mao Zedong Thought, singing the praises of the heroes of our time was the responsibility of literary and art warriors, I was creating for the revolution, I felt that no difficulty could stop me. Heroes, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, had done so many earth-shaking deeds, I should take the heroes as examples, strive for the revolution, and fight for a breath of fresh air. Heroes faced death without changing their expressions or hearts, I faced such a little difficulty, what was there to be afraid of!

Chairman Mao said: "Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results, and good things can also lead to bad results." I had not written a novel, and my literary cultivation was poor, these were bad things. But precisely because I had not written a novel, there were fewer frameworks in my mind; precisely because my literary cultivation was poor, I had relatively fewer novels to read, and was relatively less poisoned by feudal, capitalist, and revisionist literature and art, what was bad about this?

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, I did not lower the requirements for the work, but instead proposed a high standard. I was determined to write the spirit of our times, that is, the great changes the army had experienced in recent years under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, through Ou Yanghai's growth. My level was not high, but with the Party organization, the help of the broad masses, and the heroic lofty qualities inspiring me, this goal could be achieved. Chairman Mao said: "... it is not avoiding problems, but solving problems with an active attitude, any human difficulty can be solved." In specific descriptions, I also strove for innovation. Let me give a few examples:

In feudal, capitalist, and revisionist novels, they often used a lot of space and words to describe a woman's eyebrows and eyes. This was not strange because they did not participate in labor and did not know how to labor, their souls were very empty, very dirty, and very low. Not writing about a woman's eyebrows and eyes, they had no way to express their exploitative class thoughts and feelings, no way to vent them. This was the product of their exploitative class consciousness. We are revolutionaries, laborers, the creators of a new world. Hands that are rough from labor, to us, are more beautiful than anything. Chairman Mao taught us: "You are a bourgeois literary and art worker, you do not sing the praises of the proletariat but sing the praises of the bourgeoisie; you are a proletarian literary and art worker, you do not sing the praises of the bourgeoisie but sing the praises of the proletariat and the laboring people: one of the two must be chosen." Bourgeois writers looked down on the laboring people's strong hands, we would deliberately write about the laboring people's hands. In the company, I held countless hands of our soldiers, those hands that knew how to labor and serve the people; in the countryside, I held the hands of poor and lower-middle peasants, held the hands of Ou Yanghengwen, an old man who had labored all his life and had thick calluses. It was these hands that educated me, making me understand class struggle more clearly, understand that labor creates the world, understand the thoughts and feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers. From not being familiar with these hands to respecting these hands, loving these hands, I had to write. In the novel, I wrote about Ou Yanghengwen's hands that had labored all his life, Da Liu's hands full of thick calluses, Zhang Wuming's hands injured for the revolution, Guan Yingkui's hands that had squeezed the pen into grooves, as well as Ou Yanghai's hands that had held the dog-beating stick, held the hoe handle, carried the gun, hammered, dug mud, picked tea seeds, repaired culverts, and continued to labor despite being burned by fire to save people's lives and property. The fact proved that these descriptions were welcomed and approved by the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

There were also some "well-meaning" people who said not to describe too much of the heroes' inner activities. They said that heroes, especially those who had sacrificed themselves, no one knew what they were thinking, it was easy to make mistakes by replacing the heroes' feelings with petty-bourgeois thoughts. At first, this seemed to make sense. My thought transformation had just begun, and the incorrect things in my thoughts and feelings often unconsciously flowed out, it was easy to distort the heroes and make a mistake. However, I did not listen to this "well-meaning" advice. The heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought had the greatest thoughts and the highest feelings. "Standing in the company, thinking of the world," this was such a lofty proletarian feeling, this was such a selfless, taking the world as one's responsibility, internationalist thought! These thoughts, these feelings, educated me, moved me, this was the unique quality of Chairman Mao's good soldiers, it made all the heroes praised by the exploitative classes pale in comparison and lose their luster. Such thoughts and feelings, why not express them? Not writing about the heroes' broad spiritual world, one could not correctly portray the heroes of our times. Starting from this point, one should not consider whether one would make mistakes, one should think about how to better highlight Mao Zedong Thought. As long as it was beneficial to the revolution, one should write, one should write in bold strokes. In the novel, a large number of inner activities of Ou Yanghai and other characters were described. A large number of passages were used to comment on their lofty thoughts. Not only was it written what Ou Yanghai did, but also why he did it. To refute the fallacies of Feng Ding and others who slandered the heroes' self-sacrifice for the people as "justice impulse," in the moment before Ou Yanghai's sacrifice, the inner activities of the hero were thoroughly revealed. We and the hero together reviewed his great life, reviewed the glorious road he had walked, and thus fully explained that the hero could rush forward to push the horse and save the train, completely because of the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

These problems, originally thought to be description problems, technical problems, were found to be fundamentally problems of stance and thoughtfulness while writing. Not following Chairman Mao's teachings, using politics to command everything, and starting from techniques could not solve these problems. Following Chairman Mao's instructions, taking heroic characters as examples, establishing the belief of creating for the revolution, one would dare to innovate, dare to be first. Breaking private interests, one's courage would grow, one would dare to be first. Daring, first of all, was to break the superstition of ancient and foreign classics, to break the superstition of bourgeois "authorities" and "experts." Proletarian literary and art warriors must establish great ambitions and daring, dare to despise the "achievements" of literature and art that had been promoting private ownership for thousands of years, dare to completely break with them, and walk our own road, walk the correct road pointed out by our great leader Chairman Mao.

All achievements belong to the Party, belong to the masses, belong to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao said: "Proletarian literature and art is a part of the entire revolutionary cause of the proletariat, as Lenin said, is a 'gear and screw' of the entire revolutionary machine." Since our literature and art is the Party's cause, the people's cause, creating for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and being used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers, then the creative activities should be examined by the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and be commanded by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. To do this, one must put public interests first. But in literary and art work, there has been an abnormal phenomenon for many years, an unreasonable phenomenon. Workers produce products, peasants grow grain, they have always belonged to the collective's wealth, society's wealth. They do not regard products as private property, carving their names on them, not allowing others to touch them. Literary works were different, in feudal society, there were already people saying "literary works are eternal, gains and losses are known only to oneself"; in socialist society, there were still people advocating "the author is responsible for the content," in fact, it was not allowing others to comment, not allowing others to look. This was regarding creation as a personal matter, regarding works as "private property," putting private interests first. Towards works, there was also a serious struggle between public and private interests. I felt that to write good socialist literary and art works, no individual could complete it, only by putting public interests first, regarding works as society's wealth, relying on the Party, relying on the masses' instructions and help, taking the "three-in-one combination" road, could one become infinitely wise and complete the creative task.

In the process of creation, tens of thousands of comrades helped me. First of all, the Party's leadership, the higher-ups' instructions, and their meticulous care. In understanding the heroes, I was enlightened by Comrade Zhou Enlai's four sentences of calligraphy for Lei Feng, by Comrade Tao Zhu's speech at the memorial meeting for Ou Yanghai. The higher-ups at all levels gave the most detailed instructions on how to reflect the great changes the army had experienced in recent years, and the Guangyang County Committee gave the most detailed instructions on how to reflect the class struggle in the countryside. The broad masses also helped me a great deal, from the ideological content to the artistic content, from the overall plot to individual words, they gave me tremendous help, almost teaching me how to write word by word. It could be said that the parts of the novel that were affirmed were all the results of the Party's care and instructions and the masses' help, and the shortcomings of the novel were all the reflections of my low ideological level. The heroes were nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought, the deeds were created by the heroes' active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, the materials were provided by the masses, and the specific writing was the result of everyone's ideas. In the entire creative process, I only did a little recording work. This work was also done by following Chairman Mao's teachings, constantly breaking private interests and establishing public spirit. The appearance of The Song of Ou Yanghai was a victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is being carried out vigorously, all the superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base must be reformed, all ideological positions must be occupied by Mao Zedong Thought. This was the best time to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, the best time to carry out self-revolution and thorough revolution. In the future, I will definitely follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, do my best to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, truly grasp it. I will definitely take the "Three Articles" as my motto, grasp the transformation of worldview, learn for life, use for life, vow to be a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought for life, a guard of Mao Zedong Thought for life.
