Edition: 2

The song of Ou Yanghai is an excellent novel since the founding of the country. It demonstrates the boundless power of great Mao Zedong Thought in nurturing and creating new communist people. It shows that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the correct leadership of the Central Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao, has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, insisted on the Four Firsts, promoted the Three-Eights style, and launched the movement to create excellent companies. This novel, once published, was warmly welcomed by a wide readership and has become an excellent material for propagating and learning Mao Zedong Thought. The success of The Song of Ou Yanghai is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought; the success of The Song of Ou Yanghai shows that socialist literature and art can only create heroic images armed with Mao Zedong Thought to possess great vitality.

How can one write such an excellent work as The Song of Ou Yanghai? Comrade Jin Jingmai, the author, vividly answers this question with his personal experience: the most fundamental thing is to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's soul and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's direction for literature and art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Comrade Jin Jingmai follows Chairman Mao's teachings and honestly transforms his thoughts in the army, this great school of Mao Zedong Thought. He constantly uses Mao Zedong Thought to examine himself, find his goals, and constantly learns from the soldiers to find the gaps in his thoughts. In the struggle to transform his soul, he bravely breaks private interests and establishes public spirit. He deeply feels that "to write revolutionary literature, one must first become a revolutionary."

Comrade Jin Jingmai follows Chairman Mao's teachings and resolutely goes to the fiery struggle, to the company, this great furnace, and lives, studies, works, and trains with the soldiers. He rolls around with them, becomes familiar with the soldiers and life, and gains the source of creation.

In the process of creating this novel, Comrade Jin Jingmai deeply feels that only by taking great Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, relying on the Party, relying on the masses, and taking the "three-in-one combination" road, can one become infinitely wise and complete the task of creation. Comrade Jin Jingmai's experience of breaking private interests, establishing public spirit, transforming thoughts, and creating for the revolution is worth every revolutionary literature and art worker studying seriously.

The following is an excerpt from Comrade Jin Jingmai's speech at the Guangzhou Military Region's Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works.

Creating cannot be done with personal motives; public and private interests cannot coexist.

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Fundamentally, it is a revolution to transform people's souls, a revolution to break private interests and establish public spirit. Private interests are the roots of all exploitative class consciousness over thousands of years; public interests are the concentrated expression of proletarian thought. Public and private interests are fundamentally opposed, incompatible like water and fire, and cannot coexist. The struggle between public and private interests is a life-and-death struggle between two classes and two roads. This truth I did not understand before. I always wanted to add some personal motives to my revolutionary work, wanting to achieve "balancing public and private interests," or at least "public first, private second." I did not understand that one should strive for selflessness. On this issue, I took many detours.

Before the end of 1960, I was in the drama troupe's acting team. When acting, the question of whether to act for public or private interests was fiercely struggling in my mind. Acting for public or private interests is about why one lives. This question everyone must answer. At that time, I answered it like this: generally, I live for the revolution, but it would be best to live comfortably, endure less hardship, and achieve something extraordinary. In fact, this was just dressing up my bourgeois worldview with the words "for the revolution." With such a worldview, I preferred to act in leading roles because acting in leading roles could achieve "something extraordinary." As for performing in big cities or in companies, I preferred performing in big cities because it was more comfortable there. Although at that time I mainly acted in minor roles, did lighting, and moved scenery, and although I was praised for these tasks, my heart yearned for leading roles. My voice was not good, and my appearance was not good either. The director would not assign me the task of portraying positive heroic characters, at most letting me play a "Spy A" or "Bandit B" with about ten lines of dialogue. I thought to myself: "With my level, am I to do this every day?" Public and private interests cannot be balanced, and I was secretly troubled. I wanted to find some other job to display my "talent."

At the end of 1960, the organization assigned me to the creation group to learn writing. I was very happy because creative work does not require a good voice or good appearance, and there is no distinction between leading and supporting roles. I made up my mind to strive for a breath of fresh air and quickly write some works to show my "extraordinariness." On the surface, it was creating for the revolution, but in reality, it was mixed with personal motives.

As a creator, one must go to the army to experience life. My first feeling was that this was even more tiring than acting. The scorching life has tempered so many good soldiers of Chairman Mao! However, with my worldview of "living comfortably," it became a hard job. Therefore, although I lived with the soldiers, my mind was on quickly gathering some materials to go back and write plays. I did not stay long and wanted to change places, never thinking that I should seriously transform myself in life. Not being down-to-earth and thorough in life, I could not truly understand the reality of our army. When I returned to the team and picked up my pen to quickly write a work to show my extraordinary self, my mind was empty, and I could not write anything.

Mao Zedong Thought is fundamentally opposed to private ownership and all exploitative class consciousness. "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." If the private interests are not destroyed, the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought cannot be mastered. Chairman Mao repeatedly taught us revolutionary literature and art workers, "You must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, to the fiery struggle, to the only vast and rich source, ... and then you can enter the creative process." My life like a dragonfly skimming the water's surface and interviewing like a horse racing past flowers was fundamentally against Chairman Mao's teachings. With personal motives, I was afraid of hardship and fatigue, how could I thoroughly and unconditionally immerse myself in life? Not following Chairman Mao's teachings, of course, I could not enter the creative process, and of course, I could not write anything.

When I was learning to write, it was the time when the Military Commission's Enlarged Meeting's "Resolution on Strengthening Political and Ideological Work in the Army" was issued. The entire army was vigorously promoting Mao Zedong Thought. This was such a good opportunity! When I was learning to create, the Party pointed out the way forward so clearly, asking me to follow the correct direction indicated by Chairman Mao. However, because the "private" in my mind was not destroyed, I still took many detours.

Grasping the transformation of worldview is the fundamental way to do everything well.

Chairman Mao said: "Among all things in the world, people are the most precious." Doing revolution relies on people, and doing everything well relies on highlighting the human factor. Creative work is no exception. To do creative work well, one must use Mao Zedong Thought to educate, transform, and arm the creators. If one does not grasp the transformation of one's worldview, one cannot talk about completing the creative tasks assigned by the Party.

Previously, in my creation, I wanted to achieve so-called "balancing public and private interests," which in essence was an attempt to let bourgeois individualism exist secretly and legally. I did not have the correct understanding of this mistake at that time. I attributed my inability to write works to my writing skills not being solid enough. I thought: if my writing skills were very proficient, even if I did not spend a long time in life, I would quickly be able to create something.

At the end of 1962, the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was issued, and our most beloved leader Chairman Mao once again emphasized the theory of contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society. The severe reality of class struggle shocked me. The creation of themes not reflecting reality, superficial life experience, and emphasis on improving skills were not my creations but were advocated by the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Zhou Yang. It was the fallacious theory spread by class enemies to mislead revolutionary literature and art workers and to change Chairman Mao's literary line. Its existence and spread showed the severity of class struggle. With private interests, one would deviate from the correct direction indicated by Chairman Mao; with private interests, one would be captured by class enemies. If one did not turn back, it would not be a matter of taking detours and falling down but would be falling into the quagmire of bourgeois literary line and becoming a criminal of the revolution. The harm of private interests was so great. Whether to transform one's thoughts or not was a matter of whether one could continue the revolution. I could not be deluded any longer.

At this time, reading Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" again, the feeling was quite different. Chairman Mao had warned in the "Talks" that intellectuals engaged in literature and art must "change their thoughts and feelings, undergo a transformation. Without this change, without this transformation, nothing can be done well, everything will be out of place." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, with the initial desire to transform myself, I went deep into life again. It was like entering a brand-new world.

The following spring, the deeds of Comrade Lei Feng and the Eighth Company were publicized. The army, taking Comrade Lei Feng and the Eighth Company as examples, launched a new high tide of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. The broad cadre and soldiers further armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and good people and good deeds were everywhere. There was a soldier who had just joined the army, a young man from a minority. He was illiterate and usually spoke very little, seeming not to understand any principles. When he studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune," his family wrote a letter to pull him back. This soldier covered the cover of Chairman Mao's works with paper and wrote his first letter in his life like copying red characters. The whole letter had only one sentence: I am serving the people. But these seven words, each word shone with gold! Although this little soldier knew few principles, he understood the most fundamental principle, and on the question of why one lives, he understood more and was stronger than me. There was also a quartermaster. When a comrade's family was in difficulty, he sent ten yuan from his salary at once, but when buying matches for the mess hall, he did not buy the two-fen-per-box matches from the nearby shop but went an extra ten miles to the service society to buy them. Because the service society's matches were five fen for three boxes. He thought: serving the people, what's the big deal about walking an extra ten miles? One box of matches can save the company three fen and three cents! Walking an extra ten miles would of course be more tiring, but he considered the collective, the people. What weight these three fen and three cents had! This was our soldier, this was our great reality. Since Comrade Lin Biao called on us to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, the army has produced such a batch of new people: they knew few principles before joining the army, but after coming to the revolutionary army, the first article they learned was "In Memory of Norman Bethune." But they learned one sentence and used one sentence, did what Chairman Mao said, and did it exactly as Chairman Mao said. Towards Chairman Mao's instructions, they truly did one hundred percent loyally. These were new communist people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They were following Chairman Mao's teachings, advancing towards the great goal of becoming "an honorable person, a pure person, a person with morality, a person who has shed low-level interests, a person who benefits the people."

Comparing these ordinary soldiers with myself, I was far behind! In life, there are always these two kinds of people, both nominally doing the revolution: one kind of person is selfless, thinking of others, the collective, the Party, and the people's interests in everything; one kind of person always cannot give up the private interests, thinking that selflessness is "losing out," just as Chairman Mao criticized: "When faced with something, think for yourself first, then for others." One kind of person is selfless, open and upright, and feels sweet even when enduring hardship; one kind of person is always calculating his own small account, living unhappily. Comparing with revolutionary soldiers, every matter made me feel ashamed. It was only at this time that I began to understand that I should use the "Three Articles" to transform my worldview.

Why did I awaken so late? When I first joined the army, there was a plaque at the camp gate with Chairman Mao's calligraphy: "Serve the People." For more than a decade, I often learned and often talked about it, but why did I still learn it badly and use it badly? The root cause was the issue of class stance and class feelings.

I came from a petty-bourgeois family and lived a life of "economic self-sufficiency." Although I was not satisfied with the old society, I did not urgently "need a revolution to change the status quo." After liberation, joining the revolution, my political status and economic life underwent fundamental changes. However, for me, liberation or not was a matter of hunger and cold versus warmth and fullness, while for the broad masses of workers and peasants, liberation or not was a matter of life and death. Hunger and cold versus warmth and fullness were different from life and death. It was determined by class status, it was a brand, it was the basis of class consciousness. It could determine your attitude towards the democratic revolution and also affect your attitude towards the socialist revolution. The socialist revolution was to break private interests and establish public spirit. The most powerful weapon to break private interests and establish public spirit was Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, the attitude towards the socialist revolution was also the attitude towards breaking private interests and establishing public spirit, which was concentrated in the attitude towards learning Chairman Mao's works. I loved Chairman Mao, but compared to comrades from worker and peasant backgrounds, I did not love him as deeply. I believed in Mao Zedong Thought, but I was not as loyal as the worker and peasant masses. My feelings were not as deep as the worker and peasant masses, so my learning of Chairman Mao's works was far from as conscious and good as the soldiers'. To eliminate the private interests in one's thoughts, one must study Chairman Mao's works thoroughly, and not put the private interests in a position to be beaten and fought, otherwise one could not learn Chairman Mao's works well.

Comrade Lin Biao said: Our proletarian literature and art are "a tool to propagate Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in an image and popular way." Without fighting against private interests and thoroughly transforming one's soul with Mao Zedong Thought, how could one write literary and art works to propagate Mao Zedong Thought? Some bourgeois writers, their skills were not low, but could they write works to praise Mao Zedong Thought? Politics is the commander, the soul. The reason I could not write works was not a matter of skills, but a lack of politics, a lack of firm thoughts. The fundamental of creative work, like all other revolutionary work, was to learn Chairman Mao's works thoroughly, to revolutionize one's thoughts, to grasp the transformation of worldview.

The best classroom for transformation is among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, in the fiery struggle.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Our literature and art workers must complete this task, must move their standpoints over, must in the process of deeply immersing themselves in the workers, peasants, and soldiers, in the actual struggle, in the process of learning Marxism and learning society, gradually move over, move to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, move to the side of the proletariat. Only in this way can we have true literature and art for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, true proletarian literature and art." Chairman Mao's words are truly correct. Take the example of saving three fen and three cents with one box of matches, standing from the standpoint of individualism, it was considered a losing deal, only by moving the standpoint to the side of the proletariat, one could feel that this spirit was great, worthy of learning, worthy of propagating through art forms. Without humbly learning from the soldiers, without breaking private interests and establishing public spirit, without first becoming a revolutionary, one could not write revolutionary literature and art works. I was a creator in the army and should humbly go to the army, be a student of the soldiers. I had the thought of fearing hardship and fatigue, only by being with the selfless soldiers, following their learning of the "Three Articles," under their help and supervision, could I promote my thought transformation.

I felt that soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought were the most selfless and simple, and the best classroom for intellectuals to transform themselves was among them. In the company, one could be educated everywhere. There was a duty, no matter how tired, everyone competed to do it. During rest time and holidays, everyone rushed to do good deeds. Going to the mess hall to help with cooking, if you went late, there was no work for you. These were small things, but every matter attacked my "private interests," every matter made me feel that public interests were great and private interests were shameful. At first, I forced myself to learn to do it, and doing it became a habit. When it was time to watch a movie, I volunteered to stay behind to guard the house; when guarding the house, I did not forget to hang the mosquito nets for the comrades and prepare a few basins of water for them to wash their feet when they returned. These were the most minor labors, as long as you thought of the collective, you would do it consciously. Doing it, the soldiers would treat you as a family member, take care of you without missing a detail, and talk to you without holding back; in return, it deepened your class feelings for the soldiers. After a period of time, I felt that such a life was much happier than my original life, although it was a bit hard and tiring, but my heart was very steady, and everything was comfortable.

Of course, the transformation of intellectuals was not easy, and without working hard to undergo long-term tempering, it was not enough. Once, during a field training exercise in the army, we walked continuously for two days and one night, covering more than two hundred miles, and my feet were blistered several times, each step was very painful. I knew this was a test of revolutionary will. I had the thought of fearing hardship and fatigue, and this was precisely the time to work hard on the "use" aspect and fight against the thought of fearing hardship and fatigue. Walking and walking, two thoughts fiercely struggled in my mind. The correct thought said: you must listen to Chairman Mao's words: in times of difficulty, you must see achievements, see light, and raise our courage. We have already walked more than two hundred miles, this is an achievement, and we are about to complete the task of rushing, this is light, persevering to the end is victory. The backward thought said: field training for me, tempering the soles of my feet was secondary, the main thing was to experience the soldiers' thoughts and feelings during the rush, we had already walked so far, the comrades' firm will during the rush had been basically experienced, besides, I really could not walk anymore, tempering should be done slowly. These two thoughts, who would win, was not clear, the company commander saw me limping and advised me to stay by the road to wait for the car, I thought of my task of transformation and tempering, gritted my teeth and did not do it. I could have persevered like this. Just at this time, a car honked past me, but I moved. I thought, in the city, which time going out was not by car, not by car then by bicycle. This was not a real battle, the actual meaning of persevering to the end was not great. This thought came out, my feet also hurt more, and the things on my back also became heavier. Soon, another small car came up from behind and stopped in front of me, the leader shouted, "Old Jin, get on the car!" I hesitated for a few words and finally got on. In fact, there were only about twenty miles ahead, I was only an hour earlier than the troops. That one hour! The feeling of discomfort in my heart was indescribable, until the comrades all fell asleep, my mind was still in turmoil. I thought: sitting on such a short car ride, and it was the leader who called me to sit, usually I would not regard it as a flaw, nor would it cause any thought struggle. But next to me were soldiers who persevered to the end, compared to them, it tested my attitude towards thought transformation too weakly. The last twenty miles was an exam, for me, and also for the soldiers, it gave a report: it reported that the soldiers were truly fearless heroes, I was only a dwarf in action. From this incident, I once again found the gap between myself and the soldiers. Was it that I was not as strong as them in physical strength? No! Although I was not as good as them in physical strength, the more important thing was that my thoughts were not as firm as theirs, my proletarian consciousness was not as high as theirs, and I was not as fierce as them in the "use" aspect. Individualism was a very stubborn fortress, it could find various "reasons" to numb you, if you could not hate it, you would definitely lose. In the "use" aspect, it was to use Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely fight against one's non-proletarian thoughts, first to hate non-proletarian thoughts, to hate individualism. Only by hating it could you fight it, and only by hating it fiercely could you fight it fiercely. Not fighting was not an option, and fighting without fierceness was also not an option. This time I suffered the loss of fighting without fierceness. Learning from this lesson, later when I lived in the army, my requirements for myself were stricter.

Another incident happened during another field training exercise. One day, the higher-ups stipulated that we must arrive at the designated camping place before dawn at five o'clock. It happened to be a day of heavy rain, slippery roads, and pitch-black darkness, nothing could be seen. When it was almost five o'clock, we still could not find the camping village, everyone was very anxious. I suddenly vaguely heard the sound of dogs barking, and immediately ran towards the direction of the barking with a few comrades from the communications platoon. We fell several times, covered in mud and water, but finally led the troops into the village on time. After dividing the rooms, the company commander saw that I was soaked from head to toe and told me to quickly take off my cotton-padded clothes to dry them. At that time, I was shivering from the cold, so I really dried my cotton-padded clothes. While drying, I also thought: today was not bad, I did not surrender to the thought of fearing hardship and fatigue. But looking back, those soldiers who fell and were covered in mud and water like me, none of them were drying their cotton-padded clothes, each of them took advantage of the dim light to draw water for the villagers. The day before we set out, I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with them and made a resolution together. In my opinion, the task of marching was done well, I did propaganda work all the way, and even helped a new comrade carry the gun for a while, persevered to the end, not to mention leading the troops to the camping place on time, I also led the way. I could be considered to have completely and thoroughly served the people. But the soldiers? They thought of the people's interests, thought of the rain and slippery roads making it inconvenient for the people to draw water, thought of the glorious tradition of the troops, but precisely forgot that their cotton-padded clothes were wet, forgot their own cold and fatigue. This incident gave me a great education, what was called "completely" and "thoroughly"? Awareness was different, the depth of understanding was also different.

Learning Chairman Mao's works, perhaps one could not see the difference between us at first, but how to work hard on the "use" aspect could immediately reveal a comrade's high or low level of proletarian consciousness. Awareness was high, use was better, awareness was low, use was worse. This was the fundamental reason why, when talking about revolutionary principles, I was not much different from the soldiers, but when it came to action, I was far behind them.

Learning the "Three Articles" with the soldiers and discussing learning experiences with the soldiers, I felt that each soldier was my teacher. I became more and more clear about the great power of invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Our soldiers were mostly from the countryside, they were ordinary laborers. After coming to the army for a short few years, a short few months, they actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, once armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they could move mountains and fill seas, change heaven and earth, and create any miracle in the world. Their selfless and dedicated communist style, their lofty quality of serving the people wholeheartedly, their hard-nosed style of daring to climb mountains and leap into fires for revolutionary interests, their revolutionary spirit of facing death fearlessly, all came from the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao said: "To make literature and art become a true part of the entire revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy." The most powerful weapon to unite the people and educate the people was the great Mao Zedong Thought; the most powerful weapon to attack the enemy and annihilate the enemy was the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Imperialism and all reactionaries, rely on people armed with Mao Zedong Thought to overthrow them; the private ownership concepts and all exploitative class consciousness left over from thousands of years, rely on Mao Zedong Thought to overcome. In a word, propagating Mao Zedong Thought was the highest task of our proletarian literary and art warriors. At this time, I had a strong desire to sing the praises of the great Mao Zedong Thought, to sing the praises of the new communist people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

It was in the winter of that year that I was living in the army when Ou Yanghai's heroic deed of sacrificing himself to save the train occurred. According to the instructions of the army leaders, I immediately transferred to the army where Ou Yanghai had served to live. The leaders of the army and his former comrades-in-arms told me many vivid deeds of the martyr. Comrade Ou Yanghai was a more comprehensive and great communist soldier than any soldier I had ever encountered. Every deed he did was like a political class, a class education class, a class on how to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works.

In 1962, Ou Yanghai visited his hometown. At that time, he had been away from home for four years. His brother was the team leader and had some problems in his work. The first words Ou Yanghai said to his brother were: "You have forgotten your roots!" I thought, if I also had a brother, in such a situation, what would I do? I would definitely ask about his health first and then criticize. This was not wrong. But look at Ou Yanghai, his attitude towards the struggle between the two roads, his attitude towards mistakes was so clear! Without strong class feelings, one could not do this.

Another example was Ou Yanghai's repair of the culvert. That day, it was raining heavily, and I passed by that culvert, which was on a simple road that no one ever noticed. On such a simple road, doing such ordinary labor, Ou Yanghai carefully carved "doing revolution" on the culvert. I stood in the rain for a long time, feeling uncomfortable for a long time. I was originally an actor, now I do creation, often representing the army leaders to visit, often having to transform people's souls. This was such an important job! Towards such an important job, I had not connected it with doing revolution so tightly, had not regarded ordinary labor, hard work, and culverts that no one knew about as bricks and tiles of the socialist building. Some people loved socialism because socialism had no exploitation and oppression, and were willing to forget themselves for socialism; some people loved socialism only because socialism would make their lives better and better. This was worldview. What was it to live extraordinarily? Truly understanding revolution was extraordinary. Looking at the culvert, I felt that my soul was deeply touched.

A son of a poor peasant, in his short twenty-three years of life, what power made him do so many beneficial things for the people in his daily work, what power made him produce such earth-shaking heroic deeds in a critical moment? It was the great Mao Zedong Thought! From Ou Yanghai, I also thought of the ordinary and great soldiers I had encountered in the army over the years. "Doing revolution" was not the same as the seven-character letter of that minority soldier! These most simple and common words were not the words I had heard in countless soldiers' discussions of the "Three Articles," not the words I had seen in the soldiers' notebooks of learning Chairman Mao's works? Thinking of this, the scattered good deeds I had observed and experienced in the army over the years were strung together; those originally seemingly ordinary good deeds became very tall and vivid; those deeds and words of the cadres and soldiers that I could not remember clearly now came alive in my mind. I had not seen Ou Yanghai, but I seemed to have studied Chairman Mao's works with him, picked tea seeds, and repaired railways with him. He was not unfamiliar to me. It was through the study of Chairman Mao's works that I became familiar with him, understood him, and initially understood his great life. Not only Ou Yanghai, at this time, the fictional characters in the novel: Zhang Wuming, Guan Yingkui, Xiao Wei, Xiao Liu, Gao Yizhong, etc., also gradually came together and came alive in my mind from this company, that battalion, from south to north.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said so well! Life, "is the inexhaustible and boundless source of all literature and art." If it were not for following Chairman Mao's teachings, going into life to shed a few drops of sweat, I would be comfortably editing in the house, what kind of thing could I concoct? If it were not for Mao Zedong Thought enlightening my eyes, what could I see in life? If it were not for taking the soldiers as examples, learning the "Three Articles" and fiercely fighting against private interests, how could I understand the selfless communist soldiers? From the bottom of my heart, not just a thousand times, ten thousand times, I wanted to shout long live Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

Breaking private interests, establishing the spirit of creating for the revolution, only then can one dare to be first.

I did not learn Chairman Mao's works well, my thoughts were not firm, and I was a new creator in the soldiers' drama troupe, my life and skills were also not solid. Previously, I had not even successfully written a one-act play alone, let alone written or thought of writing a novel. Suddenly accepting the task of creating a long novel, I truly felt that there were many difficulties and did not know where to start. But thinking of singing the praises of Mao Zedong Thought, singing the praises of the heroes of our time was the responsibility of literary and art warriors, I was creating for the revolution, I felt that no difficulty could stop me. Heroes, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, had done so many earth-shaking deeds, I should take the heroes as examples, strive for the revolution, and fight for a breath of fresh air. Heroes faced death without changing their expressions or hearts, I faced such a little difficulty, what was there to be afraid of!

Chairman Mao said: "Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results, and good things can also lead to bad results." I had not written a novel, and my literary cultivation was poor, these were bad things. But precisely because I had not written a novel, there were fewer frameworks in my mind; precisely because my literary cultivation was poor, I had relatively fewer novels to read, and was relatively less poisoned by feudal, capitalist, and revisionist literature and art, what was bad about this?

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, I did not lower the requirements for the work, but instead proposed a high standard. I was determined to write the spirit of our times, that is, the great changes the army had experienced in recent years under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, through Ou Yanghai's growth. My level was not high, but with the Party organization, the help of the broad masses, and the heroic lofty qualities inspiring me, this goal could be achieved. Chairman Mao said: "... it is not avoiding problems, but solving problems with an active attitude, any human difficulty can be solved." In specific descriptions, I also strove for innovation. Let me give a few examples:

In feudal, capitalist, and revisionist novels, they often used a lot of space and words to describe a woman's eyebrows and eyes. This was not strange because they did not participate in labor and did not know how to labor, their souls were very empty, very dirty, and very low. Not writing about a woman's eyebrows and eyes, they had no way to express their exploitative class thoughts and feelings, no way to vent them. This was the product of their exploitative class consciousness. We are revolutionaries, laborers, the creators of a new world. Hands that are rough from labor, to us, are more beautiful than anything. Chairman Mao taught us: "You are a bourgeois literary and art worker, you do not sing the praises of the proletariat but sing the praises of the bourgeoisie; you are a proletarian literary and art worker, you do not sing the praises of the bourgeoisie but sing the praises of the proletariat and the laboring people: one of the two must be chosen." Bourgeois writers looked down on the laboring people's strong hands, we would deliberately write about the laboring people's hands. In the company, I held countless hands of our soldiers, those hands that knew how to labor and serve the people; in the countryside, I held the hands of poor and lower-middle peasants, held the hands of Ou Yanghengwen, an old man who had labored all his life and had thick calluses. It was these hands that educated me, making me understand class struggle more clearly, understand that labor creates the world, understand the thoughts and feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers. From not being familiar with these hands to respecting these hands, loving these hands, I had to write. In the novel, I wrote about Ou Yanghengwen's hands that had labored all his life, Da Liu's hands full of thick calluses, Zhang Wuming's hands injured for the revolution, Guan Yingkui's hands that had squeezed the pen into grooves, as well as Ou Yanghai's hands that had held the dog-beating stick, held the hoe handle, carried the gun, hammered, dug mud, picked tea seeds, repaired culverts, and continued to labor despite being burned by fire to save people's lives and property. The fact proved that these descriptions were welcomed and approved by the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

There were also some "well-meaning" people who said not to describe too much of the heroes' inner activities. They said that heroes, especially those who had sacrificed themselves, no one knew what they were thinking, it was easy to make mistakes by replacing the heroes' feelings with petty-bourgeois thoughts. At first, this seemed to make sense. My thought transformation had just begun, and the incorrect things in my thoughts and feelings often unconsciously flowed out, it was easy to distort the heroes and make a mistake. However, I did not listen to this "well-meaning" advice. The heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought had the greatest thoughts and the highest feelings. "Standing in the company, thinking of the world," this was such a lofty proletarian feeling, this was such a selfless, taking the world as one's responsibility, internationalist thought! These thoughts, these feelings, educated me, moved me, this was the unique quality of Chairman Mao's good soldiers, it made all the heroes praised by the exploitative classes pale in comparison and lose their luster. Such thoughts and feelings, why not express them? Not writing about the heroes' broad spiritual world, one could not correctly portray the heroes of our times. Starting from this point, one should not consider whether one would make mistakes, one should think about how to better highlight Mao Zedong Thought. As long as it was beneficial to the revolution, one should write, one should write in bold strokes. In the novel, a large number of inner activities of Ou Yanghai and other characters were described. A large number of passages were used to comment on their lofty thoughts. Not only was it written what Ou Yanghai did, but also why he did it. To refute the fallacies of Feng Ding and others who slandered the heroes' self-sacrifice for the people as "justice impulse," in the moment before Ou Yanghai's sacrifice, the inner activities of the hero were thoroughly revealed. We and the hero together reviewed his great life, reviewed the glorious road he had walked, and thus fully explained that the hero could rush forward to push the horse and save the train, completely because of the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

These problems, originally thought to be description problems, technical problems, were found to be fundamentally problems of stance and thoughtfulness while writing. Not following Chairman Mao's teachings, using politics to command everything, and starting from techniques could not solve these problems. Following Chairman Mao's instructions, taking heroic characters as examples, establishing the belief of creating for the revolution, one would dare to innovate, dare to be first. Breaking private interests, one's courage would grow, one would dare to be first. Daring, first of all, was to break the superstition of ancient and foreign classics, to break the superstition of bourgeois "authorities" and "experts." Proletarian literary and art warriors must establish great ambitions and daring, dare to despise the "achievements" of literature and art that had been promoting private ownership for thousands of years, dare to completely break with them, and walk our own road, walk the correct road pointed out by our great leader Chairman Mao.

All achievements belong to the Party, belong to the masses, belong to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao said: "Proletarian literature and art is a part of the entire revolutionary cause of the proletariat, as Lenin said, is a 'gear and screw' of the entire revolutionary machine." Since our literature and art is the Party's cause, the people's cause, creating for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and being used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers, then the creative activities should be examined by the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and be commanded by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. To do this, one must put public interests first. But in literary and art work, there has been an abnormal phenomenon for many years, an unreasonable phenomenon. Workers produce products, peasants grow grain, they have always belonged to the collective's wealth, society's wealth. They do not regard products as private property, carving their names on them, not allowing others to touch them. Literary works were different, in feudal society, there were already people saying "literary works are eternal, gains and losses are known only to oneself"; in socialist society, there were still people advocating "the author is responsible for the content," in fact, it was not allowing others to comment, not allowing others to look. This was regarding creation as a personal matter, regarding works as "private property," putting private interests first. Towards works, there was also a serious struggle between public and private interests. I felt that to write good socialist literary and art works, no individual could complete it, only by putting public interests first, regarding works as society's wealth, relying on the Party, relying on the masses' instructions and help, taking the "three-in-one combination" road, could one become infinitely wise and complete the creative task.

In the process of creation, tens of thousands of comrades helped me. First of all, the Party's leadership, the higher-ups' instructions, and their meticulous care. In understanding the heroes, I was enlightened by Comrade Zhou Enlai's four sentences of calligraphy for Lei Feng, by Comrade Tao Zhu's speech at the memorial meeting for Ou Yanghai. The higher-ups at all levels gave the most detailed instructions on how to reflect the great changes the army had experienced in recent years, and the Guangyang County Committee gave the most detailed instructions on how to reflect the class struggle in the countryside. The broad masses also helped me a great deal, from the ideological content to the artistic content, from the overall plot to individual words, they gave me tremendous help, almost teaching me how to write word by word. It could be said that the parts of the novel that were affirmed were all the results of the Party's care and instructions and the masses' help, and the shortcomings of the novel were all the reflections of my low ideological level. The heroes were nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought, the deeds were created by the heroes' active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, the materials were provided by the masses, and the specific writing was the result of everyone's ideas. In the entire creative process, I only did a little recording work. This work was also done by following Chairman Mao's teachings, constantly breaking private interests and establishing public spirit. The appearance of The Song of Ou Yanghai was a victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is being carried out vigorously, all the superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base must be reformed, all ideological positions must be occupied by Mao Zedong Thought. This was the best time to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, the best time to carry out self-revolution and thorough revolution. In the future, I will definitely follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, do my best to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, truly grasp it. I will definitely take the "Three Articles" as my motto, grasp the transformation of worldview, learn for life, use for life, vow to be a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought for life, a guard of Mao Zedong Thought for life.

    破私立公，为革命而创作
    广州部队战士话剧团　金敬迈
    编者按：《欧阳海之歌》是建国以来的一部优秀的长篇小说。它显示了伟大毛泽东思想培养造就共产主义新人的无穷威力；它显示了中国人民解放军在中央军委和林彪同志的正确领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，开展创造四好连队运动的伟大成果。这部小说一出版，就受到广大读者热烈的欢迎，成为宣传和学习毛泽东思想的很好的读物。《欧阳海之歌》的成功，是毛泽东思想的胜利；《欧阳海之歌》的成功，说明了社会主义文艺只有创造用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄形象，才具有强大的生命力。
    怎样才能写出《欧阳海之歌》这样的优秀作品呢？作者金敬迈同志，用自己切身的体会，生动地回答了这个问题：最根本的就是要用毛泽东思想来改造自己的灵魂，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务的方向。
    金敬迈同志遵循毛主席的教导，在部队这个毛泽东思想的大学校里，老老实实地改造思想。他时刻用毛泽东思想检查自己，找出前进的目标；他时刻向战士学习，找出思想的差距。他在改造灵魂的斗争中，勇敢地破“私”立“公”。他深切地体会到，“要写革命文，先做革命人。”
    金敬迈同志遵循毛主席的教导，坚决地到火热的斗争中去，到连队这个大熔炉中去，和战士一起，同吃、同住、同学习、同劳动、同操练，一块摸爬滚打，熟悉了战士，熟悉了生活，获得了创作源泉。
    在这部长篇小说的创作过程里，金敬迈同志深深体会到，只有以伟大毛泽东思想为指针，依靠党，依靠群众，走“三结合”的道路，才能变得智慧无穷，才能完成创作任务。金敬迈同志破“私”立“公”，改造思想，为革命而创作的经验，是值得每一个革命文艺工作者认真学习的。
    这里发表的，是金敬迈同志在广州部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会上的发言的摘要。
    搞创作不能带着私心，为公和为私
  绝不能“并存”
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动并领导的无产阶级文化大革命，从根本上讲，是改造人的灵魂的革命，是破私立公的革命。私，是几千年来一切剥削阶级意识的老根，总根；公是无产阶级思想的集中表现。公和私是根本对立的，是水火不相容的，是不能“并存”的。公和私的斗争是两个阶级、两条道路的你死我活的斗争。这个道理我以前不懂。我总想在干革命中加进点个人主义的私心杂念，想搞“公私兼顾”，退一步也想搞个“先公后私”，就是不懂得应该做到大公无私。在这个问题上，我就走过不少弯路。
    一九六○年年底以前，我在话剧团的演员队。当演员的时候，为公还是为私这个问题，就在我脑子里激烈地斗争着。为公还是为私，就是人活着为什么。这个问题人人都要回答。当时，我是这样回答的：总的说是为革命活着，但最好能活得舒服点，少吃点苦，最好能活得有点成就，不一般。其实，这不过是用“为革命”这三个字把自己的资产阶级人生观装扮了一番罢了。有了这种人生观，对于演主角还是演群众，我就乐意演主角，因为演主要角色能够“有所成就”。对于在大城市演出还是下连队演出，我就热中于在大城市演出，因为在大城市演出舒服些。这样，虽然当时我主要是演演群众，搞灯光，搬布景，而且搞这些工作也受过表扬，可是心里向往的却是演主角。我嗓子不好，形象也不好，导演也根本不会把扮演正面英雄人物的任务分配给我，顶多让我演个有十来句台词的
  “特务甲”“匪兵乙”。我心里想：“就我这个水平，成天干这个？”公和私不能兼顾，我心里在暗暗苦恼。我想找个别的什么工作，使自己的“才能”发挥一番。
    一九六○年年底，组织上调我到创作组来学习写作。我高兴得很。因为创作工作既不需要好嗓子，又不需要好形象，而且也没有什么主角、配角之分。我下了决心，一定要争口气，一定要尽快地写出点作品来，显显自己的“不一般”。表面上是为革命而创作，实际上夹带着个人的私心杂念。
    当创作员就得下部队去深入生活。我的第一个感觉就是这比当演员还辛苦。火辣辣的生活，锻炼出了多少个毛主席的好战士呵！可是我用“最好活得舒服点”的人生观来衡量，却变成个苦差事了。所以，我虽然和战士们生活在一起，但心里想的是赶快抓点材料，好回去编戏，呆不久就想换个地方，从没想到应该在生活中认真改造自己。在生活中不踏实，不深入，也就不能真正了解我们部队的现实。一回到团里，提起笔想尽快写出个作品来争口气的时候，心里却空空荡荡的，什么也写不出来。
    毛泽东思想是同私有观念和一切剥削阶级意识根本对立的。“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。私字没破除，毛泽东思想的伟大真理就不能学到手。毛主席一再教导我们革命的文艺工作者，“必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，……然后才有可能进入创作过程。”我那种蜻蜓点水式的生活、走马观花式的采访，是根本违反了毛主席的教导的。有个人主义的私心杂念，还怕苦怕累呢，怎么能够做到“长期地无条件地全心全意地”深入生活呢！不遵循毛主席的教导去做，当然就无法进入创作过程，当然也就什么也写不出来了。
    我学习写作的时候，正是军委扩大会议《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》下达的时候。全军上下，大立毛泽东思想。这是一个多么好的时机呵！在我学习创作的时候，党把前进的道路指得这么明确，要我沿着毛主席指出的正确方向走下去。但是，由于我思想中“私”字没破，还是走了不少弯路。
  狠抓世界观改造，是搞好一切工作的根本
    毛主席说：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。”干革命，靠人，搞好一切工作，靠突出人的因素。创作工作也不例外。要搞好创作，就得用毛泽东思想教育、改造、武装搞创作的人。不抓紧自己的世界观的改造，就谈不上完成党交给我的创作任务。
    以前，我在创作上想搞所谓“公私兼顾”，实质上是企图让资产阶级个人主义偷偷地、合法地存在着。对这个错误，我当时并没有正确的认识。我把自己写不出作品来，错误地归结为我的写作技巧不过硬。我想：假如我的写作技巧非常熟练，即令下去生活的时间不长，也会很快就能编出点东西来的。
    一九六二年年底，党的八届十中全会公报传下来，我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，再一次强调了关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的理论。阶级斗争严重存在的现实，使我受到震动。创作题材不反映现实，深入生活时走马观花，单独强调提高技巧，这些都不是我的创造，是周扬一伙反革命修正主义分子所鼓吹的。它是阶级敌人企图把革命的文艺工作者引上歧途所散布的谬论，是企图篡改毛主席文艺路线的毒草。它的存在和泛滥说明了阶级斗争的严重性。有了私心，就会背离毛主席指出的正确方向；有了私心，就会被阶级敌人所俘虏。如果再不回头，就不是走弯路、栽跟斗的问题了，而是会堕入资产阶级文艺路线的泥坑，成为革命的罪人。私字的危害就有这么大。进不进行思想改造，是决定你今后能不能继续革命的问题。自己可不能再执迷不悟了。
    这时，再读毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，感受就大不相同了。毛主席在《讲话》中早就警告过知识分子出身的文艺工作者，一定要“把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。”遵循毛主席的教导，带着改造自己的初步愿望，再次深入到生活中，我好像来到一个崭新的天地里。
    第二年的春天，雷锋同志和好八连的事迹公布了。部队以雷锋同志和好八连为榜样，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。广大指战员进一步用毛泽东思想武装起来，好人好事处处皆是。有一个参军不久的炊事员，是个少数民族青年。他不识字，平时也很少讲话，好像不懂得什么道理似的。他在学习《为人民服务》的时候，家里来信拉他的后腿。这个战士用纸蒙在毛主席著作的封面上，像描红似的写出他生平第一封信。全信只有一句话：我在为人民服务。可是这七个字呵，字字闪金光。别看这个小战士懂得的道理不多，但是最根本的道理他懂得了，在人活着为什么这个问题上，他就比我懂，比我强。还有一位司务长，战友家中有了困难，他从自己的薪金中一次寄去十块钱，可是给炊事班买火柴的时候，对门小铺里两分钱一盒的火柴他不买，却宁愿多跑十几里路，到团部服务社去买。因为服务社的火柴五分钱三盒。他想的是：为人民服务，多跑十几里有什么关系？一盒火柴能为连队节约三厘三呢！多跑十几里路当然要辛苦些，要累些，可他考虑的是集体，是人民。这三厘三该有多重的份量呵！这就是我们的战士，这就是我们伟大的现实。自从林副主席号召我们把毛泽东思想真正学到手以来，部队涌现出这样一批新人：他们参军前懂得的道理不多，来到革命部队后，学的第一篇文章，就是《为人民服务》。可是他们学一句就用一句，毛主席怎么说的，他们就怎么做。对毛主席的指示，真正做到了百分之百的忠诚。这是用毛泽东思想武装起来的共产主义新人。他们正遵循毛主席的教导，朝着做“一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人”的伟大目标前进。
    对照这些普普通通的战士再看看自己，我比他们差得太远了！生活中总有这么两种人，名义上都是在干革命：一种人一心为公，干什么都想到别人，想到集体，想到党和人民的利益；一种人老是舍不得把私字丢掉，认为大公无私是“吃了亏”，正像毛主席批评的那样：“一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算。”一种人一心为公，光明磊落，吃苦也觉得甜，心情也舒畅得很；一种人总在那里拨弄自己的小算盘，活得并不舒畅。和革命战士比一比，哪一件事都使我感到惭愧。我直到这个时候，才开始懂得要用“老三篇”来改造自己的世界观的。
    为什么我就觉悟得这么晚呢？我刚一参军的时候，营房门口就立着一块毛主席的题字：为人民服务。十几年来经常学，经常讲，为什么还是学不好，用不好呢？根源还是阶级立场，阶级感情问题。
    我出身于小资产阶级家庭，过的是“经济上大体上可以自给”的生活。虽然我对旧社会也不满，但并不是迫切地“需要一个变更现状的革命”。解放了，参加了革命，政治地位、经济生活都起了根本的变化。但是，对我来说，解不解放，是个饥寒与温饱的问题，而对于广大工农群众来说，解不解放则是关系到生死存亡的大问题。饥寒温饱和生死存亡是不同的。它是阶级地位所决定的，它就是烙印，就是阶级觉悟的基础。它既可以决定你对待民主革命的态度，又可以影响你对待社会主义革命的态度。社会主义革命就是破私立公。破私立公最强大的武器就是毛泽东思想。所以，对待社会主义革命也就是对待破私立公的态度，也集中地表现在对待毛主席著作的学习态度上。我爱毛主席，但对比之下，爱得不如工农出身的同志那样深。我坚信毛泽东思想，但也不如工农大众那样忠诚。我的感受不如工农大众那样深，所以毛主席著作的学习也远不如战士们那样自觉，那样好。要破除思想上的私字，就要大学毛主席著作，而不把私字放在一个挨打、挨斗的地位，就学不好毛主席著作。
    林彪同志说：我们无产阶级的文艺，是“形象地、通俗地宣传马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的工具”。不狠斗私字，不用毛泽东思想彻底改造自己的灵魂，怎么能写得出宣传毛泽东思想的文艺作品来呢？某些资产阶级的作家，技巧不谓不“高”吧，但是他们能写出歌颂毛泽东思想的作品来吗？政治是统帅，是灵魂。我之所以写不出作品来，不是什么技巧问题，是脑子里缺少政治，是思想不过硬。创作工作的根本和其它一切革命工作一样，都是毛主席著作学习过硬，是思想革命化，是狠抓世界观的改造。
  进行改造的最好课堂在工农兵群众中，
    在火热的斗争中
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的文艺工作者一定要完成这个任务，一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。只有这样，我们才能有真正为工农兵的文艺，真正无产阶级的文艺。”毛主席说的真是千真万确。拿那一盒火柴省了三厘三来说，站在个人主义的立场，认为那是吃亏的事，只有把立足点移到无产阶级这方面来了，才觉得这种精神了不起，值得学习，值得通过文艺形式来宣扬它。不先向战士们老老实实地学习，不破私立公，首先使自己成为一个革命者，就不可能写出革命的文艺作品来。我是部队的一个创作员，应该老老实实地下部队去，做战士们的小学生。我有怕苦怕累的私心，只有和一心为公的战士们一起，跟着他们学习“老三篇”，在他们的帮助与监督下，才能促进自己的思想改造。
    我体会到，毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，最无私、最朴实，知识分子出身的同志进行自我改造的最好课堂，就在他们身边。在连队处处都能受到教育。有个公差勤务，不管多么累，人人争着去做，休息时间、假日里，个个抢着做好事。去伙房帮厨，你去晚一点，就没你的活干。这些都是小事，但件件事都在向你的那个“私”字进攻，件件事都让你感到公字伟大，私字可耻。开始，我是强迫自己学着做，做着做着，也慢慢成了习惯。要看电影了，争取留下看家；看家的时候，忘不了替同志们把蚊帐挂好，再打几盆水放着，等同志们回来的时候好洗脚。这些都是最轻微的劳动，只要你心里想的是集体，就会自觉地做。做了，战士就把你当成亲人，对你照顾得无微不至，对你无话不说；反转来，又加深了你对战士们的阶级感情。一段时期过去了，我觉得这样的生活比我原来的生活愉快得多，虽然苦点累点，但是心里很踏实，干什么都舒舒坦坦的。
    当然，知识分子的改造是不容易的，不下苦功夫进行长期锻炼是不行的。有次在部队参加野营合练，连续走了两天一夜，奔袭了二百多里路了，脚上打了好几个泡，每迈一步都感到十分吃力。我知道这正是考验革命意志的时候。我有怕苦怕累的思想，这也正是在用字上狠下功夫，向怕苦怕累的思想开火的时候。走着走着，两种思想在脑子里激烈的斗争起来。正确的说：一定要听毛主席的话：在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。已经走了二百多里路了，这就是成绩，眼看就要完成奔袭的任务了，这就是光明，坚持到底就是胜利。落后的说：野营对我来说，练铁脚板是次要的，主要的是体会战士们在奔袭中的思想感情，已经走了这么远了，同志们在奔袭中的坚强毅力也基本体会到了，何况确实走不动了，要锻炼也得慢慢来嘛！这两种思想谁胜谁负没见分晓，连长见我一拐一拐的，劝我留在路边等汽车，我想到自己来改造锻炼的任务，咬了咬牙没干。我本可以就这样坚持下去的。就在这时候，一辆汽车呜地一声从身边开了过去，我却动了动心。我想，在城里，哪次上街还不都是坐汽车，不坐汽车也骑单车。这又不是真的战斗，坚持到底的实际意义并不大。这种思想一冒出来，脚也更痛了，背上的东西也更沉了。不一会儿，后边又上来一辆小汽车停在我面前，首长喊了声：“老金，上车吧！”我推辞了两句，终于还是坐了上去。其实，前边只有二十来里路，我只比部队早到一个多小时。这一个多小时呀！心里那个难受劲，真说不出口，直到同志们都睡着了，我思想上还在翻腾。我想：坐了这么一小段汽车，又是首长叫我坐的，往常我不会把它当成什么缺点，也不会引起什么思想斗争。可是身边就躺着一个个坚持走到底的战士，和他们一比，就考验出我对待思想改造的态度太不过硬了。最后这二十里路是一次考试，给我，也给战士们做了一份鉴定：鉴定出战士们才是真正不怕苦的好汉，我只不过是行动上的矮子。从这件事当中，我再一次找到了自己和战士们之间的差距。是我在体力上不如他们吗？不！体力上虽然不如他们棒，但更重要的是思想上不如他们过得硬，无产阶级觉悟不如他们高，在“用”字上狠下功夫不如他们狠。个人主义是相当顽固的堡垒，它能找出各种“理由”来麻痹你，对它还恨不起来，就必定要吃败仗。在“用”字上狠下功夫，就是要用毛泽东思想狠斗自己的非无产阶级思想，首先要恨非无产阶级思想，恨个人主义。恨它才会斗它，恨得狠，也才会斗得狠。不斗当然不行，斗而不狠也不行。这次就是吃了斗而不狠的亏。取得了这次教训，以后我在部队生活时，对自己的要求就比较严格些了。
    还有一件事，是在另一次野营合练中发生的。有天，上级规定必须在天亮以前五点钟赶到指定地点宿营。正碰上那天雨大路滑，黑漆漆的什么也看不见，看快五点了，可就是找不到宿营的村子，人人都很着急。我忽然隐隐听见有狗叫的声音，连忙和通讯班的几个同志一起奔着狗叫的方向跑去。我们几个摔得浑身都是泥水，终于把部队按时领进了村子。分好房子以后，营长见我浑身上下都湿透了，让我赶快把棉衣脱下来烤烤。当时我冷得直打颤，所以也真的烤起棉衣来。我一边烤，一边还想：今天不错，没有向怕苦怕累的思想屈服。可回头一看，那些和我一样摔得浑身是泥水的战士们，谁也没有在烤棉衣，一个个趁着天蒙蒙亮给老乡挑水去了。头天出发的时候，我和他们一起学习了《为人民服务》，一起表了决心，在我看来，行军的任务完成得不错，一路都在做鼓动工作，还帮一个新同志扛了一会枪，坚持到底了不说，又为部队按时赶到宿营地引了路，可以算“完全”“彻底”为人民服务了。可战士们呢？他们想的是群众利益，想的是雨大路滑群众挑水不方便，想的是部队的光荣传统，却恰恰忘记了自己的棉衣是湿的，忘记了的是自己的冷和累。这件事给了我很大的教育，怎么叫“完全”“彻底”，觉悟不同，理解的深度也就不同。
    学习毛主席著作，也许一时看不出我们彼此之间的差别，但如何在用字上狠下功夫，却可以一眼看出一个同志无产阶级觉悟的高低。觉悟高，用得就好些，觉悟低，用得就差些。这就是为什么讲起革命道理来，我和战士们差不太多，而落实到行动上则远远不如他们的根本原因。
    和战士们一起学习“老三篇”，和战士们一起讨论学习心得，我觉得战士们个个都是我的老师。我越来越清楚地认识到了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的巨大威力。我们的战士绝大部分来自农村，他们都是些普普通通的劳动者。来到部队短短几年，短短几个月的过程中，他们活学活用毛主席著作，一旦为毛泽东思想武装起来，就能移山填海，改天换地，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。他们毫不利己专门利人的共产主义风格，全心全意为人民服务的崇高品质，为了革命利益刀山敢上、火海敢闯的硬骨头作风，面对牺牲视死如归的革命献身精神，无不来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。
    毛主席说：“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”。团结人民、教育人民的最有力的武器，是伟大的毛泽东思想；打击敌人、消灭敌人的最有力的武器，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。帝国主义和一切反动派，靠毛泽东思想武装起来的人去把它们打倒；几千年遗留下来的私有观念和一切剥削阶级意识，靠毛泽东思想去战胜。一句话，宣传毛泽东思想，是我们无产阶级文艺战士的最高任务。这时，我产生了强烈的愿望，要歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想，要歌颂毛泽东思想武装起来的共产主义新人。
    就在这一年的冬天，我正在部队生活的时候，欧阳海舍身救车的英雄行为发生了。根据部队首长的指示，我立即转到欧阳海生前所在的部队去生活。部队的首长和他生前的战友们向我讲述了烈士许多生动的事迹。欧阳海同志是一个比我过去所接触过的战士更全面、更伟大的共产主义战士。他所做的每一件事，都等于给我上了一堂政治课，一堂阶级教育课，一堂如何活学活用毛主席著作的课。
     一九六二年欧阳海探家，那时他离家已经四年了。他哥哥当生产队长，工作上有点毛病，欧阳海见到哥哥的第一句话就是：“你忘了本！”我想，如果我也有个哥哥，也是在这种情况下，我会怎么样呢？我一定是先问寒问暖，然后才进行批评。这样做也不为错。可是看看欧阳海，他对待两条道路的斗争，对待错误的态度是多么鲜明！没有强烈的阶级感情，就做不到这一点。
    再有，就是欧阳海的修涵洞。那天正下着大雨，我路过那个涵洞，又是修在一条从不被别人注意的简便公路上的。就在这样一条公路上，从事着这么平凡的劳动，欧阳海却在洞口细心地刻上了“干革命”三个字。我站在雨地里想了好半天，心里也难受了好半天。我原先是演戏的，现在搞创作，动不动就是代表部队首长来慰问，动不动就要改造人的灵魂。这是多么重要的工作啊！对待这么重要的工作，我就没有像欧阳海同志这样，把它和干革命联系得这么紧，就没有把平凡的劳动、艰苦的工作，不为人们所知道的涵洞看成是社会主义大厦的一砖一瓦。有的人爱社会主义，因为社会主义社会没有剥削，没有压迫，愿意为社会主义忘我劳动；有的人爱社会主义，只是因为社会主义会使他的日子越过越舒服。这就是人生观。什么才叫做活得不一般呢？真正懂得了干革命，就很不一般。望着涵洞，我觉得我的灵魂深处，深深被触动了。
    一个贫农的儿子，在短短二十三年的生命中，是什么力量使他在日常工作中做出了这么多有益于人民的事，是什么力量使他在千钧一发的时刻产生出惊天动地的英雄行为来？是伟大的毛泽东思想！从欧阳海身上，也使我联想起几年来在部队所接触过的那些平凡而伟大的战士们来。“干革命”这三个字，不也就是那位少数民族战士短短七个字的一封信吗！这些最朴素，最常见的几个字，不就是我在无数次战士们学习“老三篇”的讨论会上听到过的，在战士们学习毛主席著作的心得笔记本上看到过的吗？想到这个，几年来在部队观察、体验到的那些零零散散的好人好事，都被串起来了；那些原先看起来是平平凡凡的好人好事，都变得非常高大，非常生动了；那些已经记不太清楚了的干部、战士们的一言一行，现在都在我脑子里活动起来。我没有见过欧阳海，但我又好像曾经和他在一起学习过毛主席著作，一起拣过茶籽、修过铁路。他在我脑子里并不陌生。正是通过毛主席著作的学习，我才熟悉他、了解他，也初步能够理解他伟大的一生。不仅对欧阳海同志，这时，小说中一些虚构的人物：曾武军指导员、关英奎连长、小魏、小刘、高翼中等等，也都从这个连、那个团，从山南海北逐渐在我脑子里综合起来，活动起来。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说得多好呵！生活，“是一切文学艺术的取之不尽、用之不竭的唯一的源泉。”要不是遵循着毛主席的教导，到生活中去流了几滴汗，我关在屋子里边舒舒服服的编，能胡编出个什么玩艺儿来呢？要不是毛泽东思想擦亮了我的眼睛，我在生活中又能看见些什么呢？要不是以战士们为榜样，学习“老三篇”狠斗私字，我又怎么能理解一心为公的共产主义战士呢？我从心底，不止一千遍、一万遍地想高呼毛泽东思想万岁！毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    破掉私字，树立为革命而创作的思想，
    才能敢字当头
    毛主席著作我学得不好、思想不过硬，我又是战士话剧团的一个新创作员，生活、技巧也都不过硬。从前，我连独幕话剧也没有单独写成功一个，更没有写过、也没有想到过要写小说。突然接受了一部长篇小说的创作任务，我真感到困难重重，无从下笔。但想到歌颂毛泽东思想，歌颂我们时代的英雄人物是文艺战士的责任，我是在为革命而创作，我又觉得没有什么困难能难住我。英雄在毛泽东思想的哺育下，把这么多惊天动地的事迹都做出来了，我应该以英雄为榜样，要为革命争口气。英雄面对死亡，脸不变色心不跳，我面对这么点困难，有什么可怕的！
    毛主席说：“在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果，好的东西也可以引出坏的结果。”我没有写过小说，文学修养又很差，这些都是坏事。但是，正因为我没有写过小说，脑子里的条条框框就少些；正因为文学修养差，读的小说不多，受封建主义、资本主义、修正主义文艺的毒害就相对地少得多，这有什么不好的？
    根据毛主席的这些教导，我没有降低对作品的要求，相反提出了一个高标准。我决心通过欧阳海的成长，把我们的时代精神，也就是部队这几年来高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗所经历的巨大变化写出来。我的水平不高，但有党组织、有广大群众帮助我，有英雄的崇高品质在鼓舞着我，这个目标是可以达到的。毛主席说：“……不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”在具体描写上，也力争创新。举几个例子来说：
    封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的小说中，常常用大量篇幅、不厌其烦地描写一个女人的眉毛呀、眼睛呀。这并不奇怪，因为他们从不参加劳动，也不会劳动，他们的心灵空虚得很，肮脏得很，低下得很。不写女人的眉毛、眼睛，他们剥削阶级的思想感情就无以寄托，无从发泄。这是他们剥削阶级意识指导下的产物。我们是革命者，是劳动者，是用双手创造新世界的主人。会劳动而又粗糙的手，对我们来说比什么都美。毛主席教导我们：“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民：二者必居其一。”资产阶级作家瞧不起劳动人民粗壮的手，我们就偏偏要写劳动人民的手。在连队，我握过无数双我们战士的那些会劳动、会为人民服务的厚实有力的大手；在农村我握过贫下中农，握过欧阳恒文老人那双劳动了一辈子，长满了厚茧的手。正是这一双双的手教育过我，使我更清楚地懂得了阶级斗争，懂得了劳动创造世界，懂得了工农兵的思想感情。我由不熟悉这些手到尊重这些手，爱上这些手，我非写不可。在小说里，写了欧阳恒文那双劳动了一辈子的手，大刘的长满了厚茧的手，曾武军为革命负过伤的手，关英奎把钢笔都捏出了一道道槽槽的手，以及欧阳海拿过打狗棒，握过锄头把、扛枪、打锤、挖泥、拣茶籽、修涵洞、为抢救人民生命财产而被火烧伤了又继续劳动着的那双有益于人民的手。事实证明，这些描写，工农兵群众是欢迎的，是批准了的。
    另外，也有些“好心人”说，不要过多的描写英雄人物的内心活动。说是英雄人物尤其是牺牲了的英雄，他心里是怎么想的，谁也不知道，搞不好就是用小资产阶级的思想感情代替了英雄人物的感情，容易犯错误。猛一听这话觉得也有道理。我的思想改造还只是刚刚开始，思想感情中的一些不正确的东西也往往会不自觉地流露出来，弄不好就会变成歪曲英雄，使自己犯个错误。但是，我没有听这个“好心”的劝告。用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物，有最伟大的思想，最崇高的感情。“身在连队、胸怀世界”，这是多么崇高的无产阶级感情，这是多么无私的、以天下为己任的国际主义思想！这些思想，这些感情，教育过我，激动着我，这是毛主席的好战士所特有的品质，它使一切剥削阶级所吹捧的英雄，相形见绌、黯然失色。这样的思想感情为什么不该抒发？不写出英雄人物宽阔的精神世界，就不能正确地表现我们时代的英雄。从这点出发，根本不该考虑自己会不会犯什么错误，应该想的是怎样才能更好地突出毛泽东思想。只要对革命有利，就应该写，应该大写特写。在小说中，大量描述了欧阳海及其他人物的心理活动。用了大量的篇幅，对他们的崇高思想发表了议论。不仅写了欧阳海做了些什么，而且写了他为什么这样做。为了驳斥冯定之流污蔑英雄为人民献身是什么“正义冲动”的谬论，在欧阳海牺牲前，利用那短短的一瞬间，详尽地揭示了英雄的内心活动。我们和英雄一起，回顾了他伟大的一生，回顾了他所走过的光辉的道路，这样来充分说明，英雄能够冲上前去推马救车，完全是伟大的毛泽东思想所哺育的结果。
    这些问题，原来以为是描写问题，是技巧性的问题，写着写着才发现它们实质上都是立场、思想性的问题。不遵循毛主席教导，用政治来统帅一切，单从技巧上着手，是解决不了这些问题的。照毛主席的指示办事，以英雄人物为榜样，树立为革命而创作的信念，就敢于标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异。破除了私心，胆才大得起来，才能敢字当头。敢，首先是破除对中外古典文学的迷信，破除对资产阶级“权威”“专家”的迷信。无产阶级的文艺战士，一定要树立雄心壮志，敢于藐视几千年来以宣传私有制为核心的文学艺术的“成就”，敢于同它们彻底决裂，走我们自己的道路，走伟大领袖毛主席指出的正确道路。
      一切成就归功于党，归功于群众，
        归功于伟大领袖毛主席
      毛主席说：“无产阶级的文学艺术是无产阶级整个革命事业的一部分，如同列宁所说，是整个革命机器中的‘齿轮和螺丝钉’。”我们的文学艺术既然是党的事业，人民的事业，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用，那么创作活动就应该经受工农兵的鉴定，听从工农兵的指挥。要做到这个，必须公字当头。但文学艺术工作中，多年来存在着一个怪现象，不合理的现象。工人生产出产品，社员种出粮食，从来都是属于集体的财富，社会的财富。他们不把产品当成私有的东西，在上边刻上自己的名字，不准别人碰一碰。文艺作品则不然，封建社会就有人说什么“文章千古事，得失寸心知”；到了社会主义社会，还有人在鼓吹什么
  “文责自负”，实际上就是不准别人提意见，不准别人看。这是把创作当成个人的事，把作品当成了“私有财产”，是私字当头。对待作品，也严重地存在着为公还是为私的斗争。我体会到要写好社会主义的文学艺术作品，哪一个个人都是无法完成的，只有公字当头，把作品当成社会的财富，依靠党，依靠群众的指示、帮助，走“三结合”的路，才能变得智慧无穷，才能完成创作任务。
    在创作过程中，成千成万的同志帮助过我。首先是党的领导，上级的指示和无微不至的关怀。在对英雄的理解上，我是从周恩来同志给雷锋的四句题词中，从陶铸同志在追悼欧阳海的大会上的讲话中，得到启示的。各级首长对如何反映部队这几年的巨大变化，桂阳县委对如何反映农村的阶级斗争，都给了最详尽的指示，广大的群众更是从思想性到艺术性，从大的情节到个别词句都给了极大的帮助，真是就差一点没有把着手教我写了。可以这样说，小说中受到肯定的地方，没有一处不是党的关怀指示、群众帮助的结果，小说中的不足之处，则都是我思想水平不高的反映。英雄是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育的，事迹是英雄活学活用毛主席著作所创造的，材料是群众提供的，具体怎么写是大家出的主意，我在整个创作过程中只是做了一点文字的记录工作而已。这点工作，也是遵循毛主席的教导，不断地破私立公才做出来的。《欧阳海之歌》的出现，是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    无产阶级文化大革命正在轰轰烈烈地进行，一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，都要改革，一切思想阵地，都要用毛泽东思想去占领。这是活学活用毛主席著作最好的时机，这是进行自我革命，彻底革命的最好的时机。今后，我一定遵照林彪同志的指示，要尽最大的努力，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，真正掌握起来。一定把“老三篇”当做座右铭来学，狠抓世界观的改造，学到老，用到老，学一辈子，用一辈子，立誓做一辈子毛泽东思想的宣传员，做一辈子毛泽东思想的警卫员。
