During the busy autumn planting season, the Dangxiang Primary School in Fangxiang Production Brigade needed several curtains for building a latrine. If someone were to weave them, there wouldn't be enough time. What to do? When this problem was raised and discussed with everyone, the blind man Kong Shanming said, "My family has three straw curtains that we don't need right now, so I'll give them to Dangxiang Primary School to use!" The next day, he told his father about this, but his father said, "I still need them to cover the mud bricks!" Shanming said, "Dad, we can't say that. When our family has difficulties, hasn't the state and the collective always helped us? The collective needs our support. Can't we even contribute a few straw curtains? Dangxiang Primary School is our school for poor and lower-middle peasants. We have the responsibility to run it well." He then told his father the story of Norman Bethune, convincing him. His father happily sent the curtains to the collective for use.

Once, when the brigade was discussing the distribution of timber for repairs, Kong Shanming's father wanted a few logs. Kong Shanming said, "Norman Bethune was selfless and dedicated to helping others. Our house is still livable, so we don't need it urgently. We should give it to the poor peasant Song Yongxiang who needs it urgently." The community members said, "Shanming truly studies Chairman Mao's works and puts them into practice!"

Kong Shanming is a 24-year-old young and strong man. Because he contracted an eye disease at the age of four in the old society and his family had no money to treat it, he lost his sight. In the past, he was somewhat pessimistic about his life, but after studying Chairman Mao's works, his mind became clear. From then on, he was like a new person, showing great concern for learning and the collective. He developed a deep class sentiment for Chairman Mao's books. Unable to read them himself, he would go to listen whenever he heard that someone was studying Chairman Mao's works. He would also run to Dangxiang Primary School whenever he had free time, asking the teachers to read to him. Therefore, Chairman Mao's words took root in his mind. He said, "Chairman Mao's books are all about helping us poor and lower-middle peasants stand up and take control. They are our guiding light. Although my eyes cannot see, Chairman Mao's books have given me the clearest eyes to see problems. Listening to Chairman Mao's words is like seeing the light again."

    最明亮的眼睛
    正当秋种紧张时，方巷大队耕读小学砌厕所，急需几条帘子用。要是叫人编，时间来不及。怎么办呢？当把这个问题提出来和大家商量时，盲人孔善明说：“我家有三条草帘子，现在用不着，就给耕读小学用吧！”第二天，他把这事告诉了父亲，他父亲却说：“我还要留着盖土坯呢！”善明说：“爸爸，话不能这么说，我们家有困难，国家和集体不是经常帮助我们吗！集体需要我们支持，难道我们连几条草帘子都不肯拿出来？耕读小学就是咱们贫下中农的学校，我们有责任把它办好。”接着他又向父亲讲了白求恩的故事，把他父亲说通了，高高兴兴地把帘子送给集体使用。
    有一次，队里讨论分配修房木料，孔善明的父亲想要几根用。孔善明说：“白求恩毫不利己，专门利人，咱们家的房子还能住，暂时可不必要，应该让给急需要的贫农宋永祥。”社员们说，善明学毛主席著作真是在用字上下功夫啊！
    孔善明是一个二十四岁的年轻力壮的小伙子，因为在旧社会四岁时患眼病，家中无钱医治，瞎了双眼。过去他对自己的一生，有点悲观情绪，但是自从学习了毛主席著作，他的心亮堂了，从此也像换了一个人似的，对学习、对集体，都非常关心。他对毛主席的书，产生了深厚的阶级感情，自己不能看，一听到哪里学习毛主席著作，就去听，一有空就跑到耕读小学，请教师读给他听，因此，毛主席的话，在他脑子里扎下了根。他说：“毛主席的书，全是为我们贫下中农翻身当家做主的书，是我们的指路明灯。我的眼睛虽然看不见，毛主席的书让我有了看问题最明亮的眼睛。听了毛主席的话，等于重见了光明。”
