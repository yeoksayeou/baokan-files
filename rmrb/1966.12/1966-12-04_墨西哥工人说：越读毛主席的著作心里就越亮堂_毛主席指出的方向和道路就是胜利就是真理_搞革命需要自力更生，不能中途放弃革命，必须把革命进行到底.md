Mexican workers say: The more they read Chairman Mao's works, the brighter their hearts become. Chairman Mao's indicated direction and path are victory and truth. Revolution requires self-reliance; one cannot abandon the revolution midway and must carry the revolution through to the end.

Xinhua News Agency reports from Mexico: Several Mexican workers recently spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter here, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao as the unsetting red sun in the hearts of workers around the world. They pointed out that the workers of Latin America must advance along the direction and path indicated by Chairman Mao.

An ironworker excitedly said, "Chairman Mao is the unsetting red sun in our hearts; Beijing has become the radiant beacon for the world's working class." He said that the great victories achieved by Chinese workers under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China in the socialist revolution and socialist construction are a tremendous inspiration to international proletarians.

He also pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. He said, "Every word Chairman Mao says strikes a chord in our hearts. The more I read Chairman Mao's works, the brighter my heart becomes."

When discussing the significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, this ironworker said that to eliminate bourgeoisie and establish proletarian rule, the proletariat must conduct a cultural revolution after seizing political power. He emphasized that the purpose of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to completely uproot revisionism. If one is a genuine Marxist-Leninist, one has the duty to support this revolution.

This worker expressed his firm belief that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution unfolding in China will surely be victorious. He said, "This victory is not only China's victory but also a victory for the international proletariat."

A shoemaker said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China is an epoch-making event because it concerns the survival of the proletarian dictatorship.

A welder pointed out that not only must the Chinese working class advance along the direction and path indicated by Chairman Mao, but the workers of Latin America must also advance along this direction and path, because the direction and path indicated by Chairman Mao are victory and truth.

He added, "Although I am just a worker and have little education, Chairman Mao's words have always been very clear and straightforward to me. After reading Chairman Mao's works, I began to understand that revolution requires self-reliance, one cannot abandon the revolution midway, and one must carry the revolution through to the end."

    新华社讯　墨西哥讯：墨西哥几位工人最近在这里向新华社记者发表谈话，热情赞扬毛主席是世界各国工人心中不落的红太阳。他们指出，拉丁美洲的工人必须朝着毛主席指出的方向和道路前进。
    一位冶金工人激动地说，“毛主席是我们心中不落的红太阳；北京已经成了世界工人阶级的光辉灯塔。”他说，中国工人在伟大的领袖毛主席和中国共产党领导下在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中所取得的伟大胜利，是对国际无产者的巨大鼓舞。
    他还指出，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。他说：“毛主席讲的每一个字都说到我们心里，我越读毛主席的著作，我的心里就越亮堂。”
    这位冶金工人在谈到中国无产阶级文化大革命的意义时说，为了灭资兴无，无产阶级夺取政权后必须进行一次文化革命。他强调指出，无产阶级文化大革命的目的是彻底挖掉修正主义的根子。如果是真正的马克思列宁主义者，就有义务支持这场革命。
    这位工人表示坚信正在中国开展的无产阶级文化大革命必胜。他说，这个胜利不仅是中国的胜利，而且也是国际无产阶级的胜利。
    一位制鞋工人说，毛主席和中国共产党领导的文化大革命是一个划时代的事件，因为这是工人阶级政权的存亡问题。
    一位焊接工人指出，不仅仅中国工人阶级必须朝着毛主席指出的方向和道路前进，而且拉丁美洲工人也必须朝着这个方向和道路前进，因为毛主席指出的方向和道路就是胜利，就是真理。
    他又说：“虽然我是一个工人，我没有多少文化，但是毛主席的话对我来说一直是非常简明、非常清楚的。我读了毛主席的著作后开始懂得，搞革命需要自力更生，不能中途放弃革命，必须把革命进行到底。”
