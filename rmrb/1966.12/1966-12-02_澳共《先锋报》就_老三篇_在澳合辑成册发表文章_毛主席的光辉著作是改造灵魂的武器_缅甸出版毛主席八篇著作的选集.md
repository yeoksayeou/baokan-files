The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) organ, the "Pioneer," reported today that Chairman Mao Zedong's three articles, "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," have been compiled into a single volume and published in Australia.

The "Pioneer" enthusiastically praised the great significance of these three brilliant works. It wrote: "Although this small book has few pages, it contains an inexhaustible treasure. These three articles are a stirring call to communists, urging them to place service to the people and devotion to the revolution above all else. This small book will become a manual for all those who sincerely wish to serve the people and transform their souls in the process of service."

The New China News Agency, Yangon, reported that a collection of eight of Chairman Mao's works (in Burmese) has recently been published here. These works include: "On Contradiction," "On Practice," "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?," "The Enemy's Opposition Is a Good Thing, Not a Bad Thing," "Oppose Book Worship," "The Direction of the Youth Movement," "Speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China," and "Oppose Liberalism."
