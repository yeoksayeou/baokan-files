Thousands of Red Guards in Guangzhou Hold Angry Rally and Demonstration March

The thousands of Red Guards from colleges and universities in Guangzhou held rallies and demonstration marches today, expressing the strongest protest and condemnation against the fascist bloody atrocities committed by Portuguese imperialism in Macao against our compatriots, and expressing the most resolute support for the just struggle of our Macao compatriots against oppression.

Liu Dianfu, Secretary of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee, and Ke Qingyan, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, attended the mass meeting to denounce the heinous crimes of the Portuguese authorities in Macao against our compatriots.

Representatives of the Red Guards from various schools expressed their extreme indignation at the meeting, strongly condemning the fascist crimes of the Portuguese imperialists in slaughtering our Macao compatriots. They solemnly warned the Portuguese authorities: they must immediately stop the atrocities of slaughtering our Macao compatriots, immediately and unconditionally accept the just demands of our Macao compatriots, severely punish the culprits, and apologize to and compensate the families of the victims for all losses. Otherwise, all serious consequences resulting from this will be the full responsibility of the Portuguese authorities. The Red Guards who spoke at the meeting also unanimously expressed their resolute support for the just struggle of our Macao compatriots against the cruel oppression of the Portuguese authorities in Macao.

The Red Guards and revolutionary students pointed out unanimously: Under the great leadership and initiation of Chairman Mao in the great proletarian cultural revolution, the Portuguese authorities dared to ignore the great seven hundred million Chinese people, madly taking our Macao compatriots as enemies, continuously dispatching large numbers of military and police to create serious fascist atrocities, which is truly too arrogant. If they dare to be enemies of the Chinese people to the end, we Red Guards will revolt against them and break their backs. We Red Guards are the strong reserve force of the PLA, and our words are reliable. We will surely settle this blood debt. Liu Dianfu and Ke Qingyan pointed out in their speeches at the meeting that the massacre and suppression of our Macao compatriots by the Portuguese authorities in Macao is a heinous fascist crime. We, the people of Guangdong Province, express the strongest protest and the most resolute condemnation. The patriotic struggle of our Macao compatriots against the Portuguese authorities is a completely just action, and we firmly support it. The demands put forward by our Macao compatriots to the Portuguese authorities are completely reasonable, and we express our greatest support. The Portuguese authorities must immediately and unconditionally execute the five demands of our Macao compatriots; otherwise, all consequences will be the responsibility of the Portuguese authorities. The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. We swear to be the strong backing of our Macao patriotic compatriots and thoroughly smash the plots of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

After the rally, the Red Guards and revolutionary students, carrying large portraits of Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's quotations, as well as banners reading "Strongly Protest the Fascist Bloody Atrocities of the Portuguese Authorities," chanted slogans such as "Strongly Protest the Bloody Crimes of U.S. Imperialism and the Portuguese Authorities," "Down with U.S. Imperialism," "Firmly Support the Just Struggle of Our Macao Compatriots," "Long Live the Communist Party of China," and "Long Live the Great Leader Chairman Mao," and held a powerful demonstration march.

    新华社广州七日电　广州市大专院校数千红卫兵，今天纷纷举行集会和示威游行，最强烈地抗议和谴责澳门葡萄牙帝国主义屠杀澳门同胞的法西斯血腥暴行，最坚决地支持澳门同胞反对迫害的英勇正义斗争。
    中共广东省委书记处书记刘田夫，广东省副省长寇庆延等省市负责人，分别出席了声讨澳门葡萄牙当局屠杀澳门同胞的滔天罪行的大会。
    各院校的红卫兵代表们，怀着无比愤怒的心情，纷纷在声讨大会上发表讲话，强烈谴责澳葡帝国主义残杀我澳门同胞的法西斯罪行。他们严正地警告澳葡当局：必须立即停止残杀澳门同胞的暴行，立即无条件接受澳门同胞的正义要求，严惩凶手，并向受害家属道歉和赔偿一切损失，否则，由此产生的一切严重后果由澳葡当局负完全责任。在大会上发言的红卫兵们，还一致表示坚决支持澳门同胞反对澳门葡萄牙当局残酷迫害的英勇斗争。
    红卫兵和革命师生一致指出：在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导和发动的无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势下，澳葡当局竟敢无视伟大的七亿中国人民，丧心病狂地以我澳门同胞为敌，连续出动大批军警，制造严重的法西斯血案，真是太自不量力了。如果他们胆敢与中国人民为敌到底，我们红卫兵就要造他们的反，打断他们的脊骨。我们红卫兵是解放军的坚强后备军，说话是算数的。我们一定要清算这一笔血账。刘田夫和寇庆延在大会上的讲话中指出，澳门葡萄牙当局对澳门同胞的屠杀和镇压，这是一种法西斯的滔天罪行，我们广东省人民表示最强烈的抗议和最坚决的谴责。澳门爱国同胞对澳葡当局的反抗斗争，是完全正义的行动，我们坚决支持。澳门爱国同胞对澳葡当局提出的要求是完全合理的，我们表示最大的支持。澳葡当局必须立即无条件地执行澳门同胞的五项要求，否则，一切后果要由澳葡当局负责。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不好惹的，我们誓作澳门爱国同胞的坚强后盾，彻底粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶的阴谋。
    集会后，红卫兵和革命师生抬着毛主席的巨幅画像和毛主席语录牌，以及“强烈抗议澳葡当局法西斯血腥暴行”等标语，高呼“最强烈抗议美帝国主义、澳葡当局的血腥罪行”、“打倒美帝国主义”、“坚决支持澳门同胞的正义斗争”、“中国共产党万岁”、“伟大领袖毛主席万岁”等口号，进行了强大的示威游行。
