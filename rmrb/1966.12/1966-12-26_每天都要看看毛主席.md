    Look at Chairman Mao Every Day

    Not long ago, a Chinese journalist in Mali met an acquaintance from that country. With a sincere but somewhat embarrassed expression, the friend asked the journalist for a photograph of Chairman Mao Zedong. This was the third time he had asked the journalist for a photo of Chairman Mao. He said: The people of Mali love Chairman Mao so much. The photos of Chairman Mao that I previously obtained were taken away by friends as soon as I hung them up.

    During the exhibition of Dazhai pictures in Bamako, the capital of Mali, in October, many Malian friends, filled with love for Chairman Mao, came here to get a photograph or badge of Chairman Mao. A young man named Diallo, after obtaining a photograph of Chairman Mao, said: "I will hang Chairman Mao's photograph in my room. Every morning when I get up, I will first look at the respected Chairman Mao. It is Mao Zedong Thought that has illuminated the path for the oppressed peoples fighting against imperialism and colonialism. In Mali, our cigarette factories, sugar factories, and others were all built with the help of the Chinese people, all of which were done under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought."

    每天都要看看毛主席
    不久以前，在马里的一个中国记者碰见一位熟识的马里朋友。他以恳切而又带有点不好意思的心情向记者要一张毛泽东主席的照片。这是他第三次向记者要毛主席的照片了。他说：马里人民太爱毛主席了。我以前得到的毛主席照片，刚刚挂起来就被朋友拿走了。
    十月份大寨图片展览在马里首都巴马科展出期间，很多马里朋友怀着对毛主席的热爱，来这里要一张毛主席的照片或像章。一位名叫迪亚洛的青年在得到了一张毛主席照片之后说：“我要把毛主席的照片挂在我的房间里，每天早晨起床，我就首先看看敬爱的毛主席。是毛泽东思想照亮了反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的被压迫人民的道路。在马里，我们的卷烟厂、糖厂等都是中国人民帮助我们兴建的，这都是在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下进行的。”
