Chairman Mao's Red Guards Are Truly Good!

	“Chairman Mao's Red Guards are truly good, they are indeed the good offspring nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought!”

In the capital, Beijing, people are praising the young guests invited by Chairman Mao, extolling the Red Guards of Chairman Mao.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, tens of millions of Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country came to our great motherland's capital, the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—Beijing, to engage in revolutionary linking up. They brought with them their sincere hearts of boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao, to accept the inspection of the great leader Chairman Mao; they brought with them the determination to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, to seriously exchange revolutionary experiences and learn Mao Zedong Thought in the capital.

During the days of revolutionary linking up in the capital, their good thoughts, good style, and good spirit left a deep impression on the revolutionary people of the capital, and they received enthusiastic praise from the people. The following are some fragments of the many good deeds and good people:

	We Are Doing as Chairman Mao Said

In the Beijing Iron and Steel Company's smelting plant and the Zhongjingshan Gold Top Street Middle School, a moving story is being passed around: two young revolutionary comrades from outside the province, with hearts for the people, risked their lives to rescue two children who had fallen into the water.

The story goes like this:

On the afternoon of November 15 at 1:30, a worker from the smelting plant had three children who went from the Model Gate to their grandfather's house in Gold Top Street. Along the way, they passed by a river. The five-year-old younger sister, Shuhua, did not listen to her sister's warning and insisted on going to the river to wash her face. The riverbank was steep, and in an instant, little Shuhua fell into the river. The eight-year-old sister, Shujin, tried to pull her sister out, but she also fell into the river. The river was deep and the current was strong, and the sisters were seen being swept away by the current, farther and farther away.

At that moment, a female student from a nearby school who had come to Beijing for revolutionary linking up happened to pass by. Seeing this scene, she immediately took off her cotton coat and jumped into the icy, bone-chilling current to rescue Shuhua, who had fallen in first. Just then, Shujin was also in danger. Coincidentally, another male student who had come to Beijing for revolutionary linking up also happened to pass by. He also jumped into the water without hesitation to rescue Shujin. Neither of them was a good swimmer, but with the help of nearby commune members and the crowd, they finally rescued both children.

After the children were pulled out of the water, people were busy taking care of the children, and the male student disappeared in an instant. The female student was invited into a home by the crowd, who repeatedly asked her name and address and expressed their thanks, but she only said, "I didn't do anything," and left. Later, through multiple inquiries by the parents of the fallen children and the reception personnel, they finally learned the names and addresses of the two students—the Gold Top Street Middle School.

Afterward, the revolutionary teachers and students from outside the province living in the Gold Top Street Middle School and the workers from the smelting plant held separate meetings to learn from the revolutionary young comrades. Everyone expressed their desire to learn from their selfless spirit of saving others and putting the public before themselves. However, the two revolutionary young comrades repeatedly humbly said that the second life the two little sisters gained was given by Chairman Mao, and we are doing as Chairman Mao said.

	You Are Truly the Good Offspring Taught by Chairman Mao

One evening, the cadres and members of the Yonghong Production Brigade of the Dongsheng People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing finished their dinner and walked out of their homes. The revolutionary teachers and students from outside the province who were staying in the commune members' homes held them back and asked, "Do you have any business tonight?" The commune members unanimously replied, "No, no, you should rest early."

It turned out that the commune members had quietly gone to the rice fields to work at night. These past few days, the weather had suddenly turned cold, and a large batch of rice from the western suburbs of Beijing was still lying in the fields, needing to be quickly carried back to the threshing floor and cleaned and stored. Working at night was a good thing, but why did the cadres and commune members have to do it secretly? They were afraid that the revolutionary young comrades staying in the production brigade would also participate. These children from all over the country, once they stayed in the production brigade, went out to link up during the day or participated in production, and helped the poor and lower-middle peasants with housework in the early mornings and evenings. The poor and lower-middle peasants always praised these lovable red successors, and they thought the young comrades were already very tired, so they agreed that the matter of working at night must be kept secret from the young comrades.

The cadres and commune members were working hard in the fields when they suddenly saw figures approaching from afar. As they came closer, they found out that the young comrades had also come to work at night. The commune members, fearing that they would catch a cold, anxiously said, "You must listen, go back!" These young comrades, while carrying heavy bundles of rice, replied with smiles, "Precisely because we listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, we came to work at night with you." The commune members, moved, said, "You are truly the good offspring taught by Chairman Mao!"

	Class Friendship Forged in Blood

In the Beijing Fifth Construction Company, one day the loudspeaker suddenly broadcasted an urgent voice: "Comrades, attention please: a worker in the Fourth District has been injured and needs an emergency blood transfusion!"...

Quickly, the company's workers gathered together.

The revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards from the Wuhan Post and Telecommunications Institute who were staying in this company were having their midday rest. Upon hearing the broadcast, they rushed downstairs and requested to donate their blood.

	"Comrades, thank you for your concern for our worker comrades! But you have come to Beijing for linking up, with the task of accepting Chairman Mao's inspection and exchanging revolutionary experiences, so you don't need to donate blood." The company's workers insisted on donating blood themselves.

	"No. The comrades in the company still have to work and cannot donate blood! Chairman Mao calls for grasping the revolution and promoting production."

The company's workers could not stop them, and more than sixty young comrades rushed straight to the hospital. At the hospital, the young comrades waiting to donate blood held up their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," reciting:

	"We all come from the rivers and lakes, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together.... Our cadres must care for every soldier, everyone in the revolutionary ranks must care for each other, love each other, and help each other."

It is the great Mao Zedong Thought that makes class brothers from all over the country, red hearts connected to red hearts, blood vessels connected to blood vessels. In the end, two Red Guards from the Wuhan Post and Telecommunications Institute and eight comrades from the company donated blood together, saving the life of a class brother.

At the farewell meeting for the revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards from the Wuhan Post and Telecommunications Institute, the Beijing Fifth Construction Engineering Company Party Committee and the Cultural Revolution Committee presented two Red Guards with a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" each. This revolutionary treasure was wrapped in a bright red plastic cover, shining brightly. Everyone sang together:

	"The party's favor is greater than the sky and earth,
	Parents are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer,
	Everything is good, but socialism is the best,
	The love between classes is deeper than rivers and seas..."

	Care for the People and Love the People

Near the Tiananmen Square, in the automated post office, the crowd was bustling. Many revolutionary students from outside the province were sending letters here, reporting their linking up situation in Beijing to their comrades far away.

A Red Guard who came here to send a telegram saw an old woman anxiously turning around in the automatic stamp-selling area. He asked with concern, "Grandma, what's wrong?"

The old woman said, "I want to send a letter, but there are too many people, and I can't buy a stamp."

This Red Guard immediately agreed to help the old woman. The old woman gave him a letter and one jiao.

After sending the letter, he was about to return the two fen change to the old woman when he realized the old woman was gone. He was worried now, remembering the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention of the PLA. Although two fen is a small amount, it must be returned to the old woman. At this moment, he forgot about sending his telegram. He didn't find the old woman in the post office, so he immediately rushed out and finally found her at the bus station. The old woman was deeply moved by the action of this revolutionary young comrade and repeatedly said, "Thank you for your trouble. Thank you for your trouble."

This Red Guard is a member of the "Little Red Army Long March Team" from Jining Second Middle School. He is one of the many Red Guards who, like the PLA, care for and love the people.

### 毛主席的红小兵真是好！

    毛主席的红小兵真是好！
      “毛主席的红小兵真是好，不愧是毛泽东思想哺育的好后代！”
    在首都北京，人们争相夸奖毛主席请来的小客人，赞誉毛主席的红卫兵。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，全国各地上千万的红卫兵和革命师生，从五湖四海来到我们伟大祖国的首都，无产阶级文化大革命的中心——北京，进行革命大串连。他们带来了对毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的真诚之心，接受伟大领袖毛主席的检阅；他们带来了誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心，在首都认真地交流革命经验，学习毛泽东思想。
    在首都进行革命串连的日子里，他们表现出的好思想、好作风、好风格，给首都革命人民留下了深刻的印象，受到了人们的热烈赞扬。下面记述的是许许多多好人好事中的一些片断：
    我们是按照毛主席的话去做的
    在首都钢铁公司炼铁厂和石景山金顶街中学里，传颂着一件激动人心的故事：两名外地革命小将，一心为人民，冒着生命危险，抢救了两名落水儿童。
    事情的经过是这样的：
    十一月十五日下午一时半，炼铁厂一位老工人的三个小孩从模式口去金顶街爷爷家，路上经过一条河，五岁的小妹妹淑华不听姐姐阻拦，一定要到河边去洗脸。河岸很陡，一不留神，小淑华掉到河里去了。八岁的姐姐淑琴想去拉妹妹，没想到也掉进了河里。河深水急，眼看着姊妹俩被急流冲走，越冲越远。
    这时，住在附近中学里的一位外地来京串连的女学生，正好路过这里，一看这情景，立即脱下棉大衣，纵身跳进冰凉刺骨的急流，抢救首先落水的淑华。这时，淑琴也在危急之中。恰好，又有一个当天上午才到达北京的外地来京串连的男同学也路过这里，他也奋不顾身跳下水去抢救淑琴。他们两人的水性都不大好，但在附近公社社员和群众的帮助下，终于把两个孩子都救起来了。
    落水的孩子上岸以后，人们忙着照顾孩子，那个男学生一转眼就找不见了。那个女学生被群众请到家里，再三问她姓名、住址，向她表示感谢，但是她只说，“我没做什么”，也走了。后来经过落水孩子的家长和接待人员多次的了解访问，才弄清了这两个学生的姓名和他们的住址——金顶街中学。
    事后，住在金顶街中学的外地革命师生和炼铁厂工人分别举行了向革命小将学习大会。大家表示要学习他们舍己救人、公而忘私的精神。但是，两位革命小将却一再谦逊地说，两个小妹妹获得的第二次生命，是毛主席给的，我们是按照毛主席的话去做的。
  你们真是毛主席教导出来的好后代
    一天晚上，京郊东升人民公社永红生产队的干部和社员吃罢晚饭，一个个走出屋外。在社员家里的外地来京串连的革命师生拉住他们连声问：“你们今晚有什么事吗？”社员们异口同声地回答：“没事，没事，你们早点休息吧。”
    原来，社员们是悄悄地去稻田打夜战了。这两天天气骤寒，收割下来的大批京西稻还躺在地里，需要很快背回场院，打净归仓。打夜战本来是好事，为什么干部和社员要悄悄地进行呢？他们是唯恐住在生产队里的外地革命小将也去参加。这些来自五湖四海的孩子，一住到生产队，白天出去串连，或参加生产，一早一晚还帮贫下中农干家务活。贫下中农一谈起这些可爱的红后代，总要夸奖一番，他们认为小将们已经很累了，便约定打夜战的事必须向小将们“保密”。
    在地里的干部和社员干得正欢，忽然看到远处出现了人影，走近来一看，原来是小将们也来参加夜战了。社员们怕冻着他们，焦急地说：你们要听话，回去吧！这些小将们一边背起沉甸甸的大捆稻子，一边笑着回答：正是因为我们最听毛主席的话，我们才来和你们一起夜战。社员们感动地说：你们真是毛主席教导出来的好后代！
        鲜血凝成的阶级友情
    在北京市第五建筑公司，广播喇叭里有一天突然传出急促的声音：“同志们，公司的同志们请注意：四工区有位架子工受伤，急需输血抢救！……”
    很快，公司的职工聚集起来了。
    住在这个公司里的来京串连的武汉邮电学院的革命师生和红卫兵们，这时正在午休，一听到广播，急忙从楼上跑下来，要求献出自己的鲜血。
      “同学们，感谢你们对我们工人同志的关怀！但是，你们来京串连，有接受毛主席检阅和交流革命经验的任务，你们不要献血了。”公司职工坚持由自己献血。
      “不能。公司的同志们还要上班不能献血！毛主席号召，要抓革命促生产。”
    公司的职工劝阻不住，六十多个革命小将径直奔向医院。到了医院，等候献血的小将们捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，朗诵道：
      “我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”
    正是伟大的毛泽东思想，使来自五湖四海的阶级兄弟，红心连红心，血脉通血脉。最后，武汉邮电学院两位红卫兵和公司的八位同志一道献了血，抢救了阶级兄弟的生命。
    在欢送武汉邮电学院革命师生和红卫兵的大会上，北京市第五建筑工程公司党委和文化革命委员会，向两位红卫兵分别赠送了一套《毛泽东选集》。这革命的宝书是用红彤彤的塑料封皮包装的，光彩耀目。人们一起高唱：
      “天大地大不如党的恩情大，
    爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，
    千好万好不如社会主义好，
    河深海深不如阶级友爱深。……”
        关心人民爱护人民
    在天安门广场附近的自动化邮电局里，人群熙熙攘攘。许多外地革命师生在这里邮寄信件，把他们在北京串连的情况告诉远方的战友。
    一个来这里拍电报的红卫兵，看到一位老大娘在自动售邮票的地方焦急地转来转去。他关切地问：“大娘，怎么啦？”
    老大娘说：“想寄一封信，人多，买邮票挤不上。”
    这位红卫兵马上就答应给老大娘办。老大娘给了他一封信和一角钱。
    寄完信以后，他正准备把找回来的二分钱还给老大娘，才发现老大娘不见了。这下子他可着急了，他想起了解放军的三大纪律八项注意。二分钱虽然少，可是一定要还给老大娘。这时他把自己打电报的事儿忘在脑后。他在邮电局里没有找到，就立即奔出去，终于在汽车站找到了老大娘。老人被这位革命小将的行动深深地感动了，她连声地说：“麻烦你了。麻烦你了。”
    这位红卫兵是集宁二中“小红军长征队”的一个队员。他是许多像解放军一样关心人民、爱护人民的红卫兵中的一个。　新华社记者
