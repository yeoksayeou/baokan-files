Albania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs today issued a statement strongly condemning the new war crimes committed by U.S. bandit planes, which bombed the capital city of Hanoi, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on December 2 and 4. The statement pointed out that this is a step in the U.S.'s new "escalation" of the war against Vietnam.

The statement said that the bombing and other savage crimes committed by U.S. imperialists will absolutely not frighten the Vietnamese people, nor will they destroy their will. Instead, they will only deepen the Vietnamese people's hatred for the enemy and strengthen their confidence in victory.

The statement said that now it is clear to everyone that the U.S. imperialists' and their lackeys' propaganda about "stopping the bombing" and "peace talks" is completely a trick and deception, aimed at covering up the steps the U.S. is accelerating to expand the war of aggression.

The statement pointed out that it has been proven that the series of public and secret diplomatic talks conducted by U.S. imperialists and modern revisionists for "peace talks" are all aimed at deceiving the Vietnamese people and world public opinion, allowing U.S. aggressors to carry out their war plans.

The statement emphasized that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Albania strongly protests against the crimes committed by U.S. imperialists against the Vietnamese people.

The statement concluded by saying that the Albanian people, as always, will stand firmly with the fraternal Vietnamese people and are completely confident that the Vietnamese people will thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors in this just struggle.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 8, the editorial department of Albania's "People's Voice" newspaper published an article on December 7 strongly condemning the serious provocative crimes committed by U.S. bandit planes, which savagely bombed Chinese fishing boats in international waters on November 30 and December 1, killing and injuring many Chinese fishermen.

The article said that this new action by U.S. bandit planes is part of U.S. imperialism's comprehensive anti-China activities and another step in its counter-revolutionary global strategy of directing the spearhead of war towards Asia. The article said that the U.S. sends planes to savagely bomb Hanoi and brutally attack Chinese fishing boats, attempting to make the Vietnamese people surrender and bring the war to China. The article pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership is increasingly openly or secretly colluding with U.S. imperialism, trying to force the Vietnamese people to surrender and strengthen the "encirclement" of the People's Republic of China.

The article said that no matter how the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys struggle and provoke, they will never be able to stop the Chinese people from advancing victoriously on the socialist road. The great Chinese people will unite more closely around the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, ready at any time to give the U.S. aggressors the deserved retaliation, and crush any aggressor who dares to invade China.

    据新华社地拉那七日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国外交部今天发表声明，强烈谴责美国强盗飞机在十二月二日和四日再次轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市的新的战争罪行。声明指出，这是美国对越南采取新的战争“升级”的一个步骤。
    声明说，美帝国主义者的轰炸和其他野蛮罪行，绝对吓不倒越南人民，也摧毁不了他们的意志，而只会加深他们对敌人的仇恨，增强他们对胜利的信心。
    声明说，现在大家都看得很清楚，美帝国主义者及其走狗所谓“停止轰炸”和“和平谈判”的宣传，完全是一种花招和欺骗，目的在于掩盖美国为扩大侵略战争所加速采取的步骤。
    声明指出，事实证明，美帝国主义者同现代修正主义者为“和平谈判”所进行的一系列的公开和秘密的外交会谈，其目的都是为了欺骗越南人民和世界舆论，放手让美国侵略者能够推行他们的战争计划。
    声明强调指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国外交部强烈抗议美帝国主义者对越南人民犯下的罪行。
    声明最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民将一如既往，始终同兄弟的越南人民站在一起，并完全相信，越南人民在这场正义的斗争中，将彻底打败美国侵略者。
    据新华社地拉那八日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》七日发表编辑部文章，强烈谴责美国强盗飞机十一月三十日和十二月一日在公海上野蛮轰炸中国渔船，炸死炸伤中国渔民多人的严重挑衅罪行。
    文章说，美国强盗飞机的这一新的行动，是美帝国主义全面的反华活动的组成部分，也是它把战争矛头指向亚洲的反革命全球战略中的又一侵略步骤。文章说，美国派遣飞机野蛮轰炸河内和残暴袭击中国渔船，妄图使越南人民屈膝投降和把战火引向中国。文章指出，苏联修正主义领导集团正在同美帝国主义越来越加紧公开地或秘密地勾结，企图迫使越南人民屈膝投降和加强组成对人民中国的“包围圈”。
    文章说，不管美帝国主义者及其帮凶如何挣扎和挑衅，他们永远阻挡不住中国人民在社会主义道路上胜利前进。伟大的中国人民，将更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的周围，随时准备给美国侵略者以应有的回击，并且粉碎敢于侵犯中国的任何侵略者。
