The birth of China's first revolutionary ballet, "The Red Detachment of Women," is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great victory of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Its birth, like a thunderclap, shook the ballet art that had served the royal court and the bourgeoisie for hundreds of years, and sounded the death knell for the decayed, declining, and lifeless ballet art! "Use foreign things for Chinese purposes," this is the great direction pointed out by our great leader Chairman Mao. The era of transforming the ancient ballet art of the world and making it serve proletarian politics has arrived. Ballet should portray our great era, sing the praises of our proletarian heroes, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers should take over the ballet stage.

The birth of the revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" has epoch-making significance. It has been warmly welcomed and praised by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and by all revolutionary friends in the world.

Europe's great socialist beacon—heroic Albania—rehearsed and performed our country's revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" this year.

The common revolutionary ideals of the peoples of China and Albania have united us closely together, and on the road to the revolutionization of ballet, we are fighting shoulder to shoulder. This is the crystallization of the fighting friendship between the literary and artistic workers of China and Albania.

"The Red Detachment of Women" in Albania, after only five months of rehearsals, met with the heroic Albanian people. To stage China's first revolutionary ballet, they gathered the best opera and ballet performers from the entire country. The performers gave up their holidays and eagerly awaited the arrival of Chinese comrades. From the Albanian leadership of the arts to the theater leadership, they provided all the necessary conditions to ensure the successful staging of "The Red Detachment of Women." The Albanian people are extremely fond of "The Red Detachment of Women"; they all think that the revolutionary ballet is excellent!

The actress playing the female lead, Comrade Sojitza Harcho, comes from a very poor family. Her mother was martyred in prison. She was also imprisoned as a child and grew up in an orphanage. She said: "I like to perform such plays. In the past, the ballets we performed were all about princes and princesses. We are not emperors or empresses, so we cannot understand their feelings. Now, performing revolutionary plays, we can understand the feelings of the workers and peasants and find a basis in life."

An ordinary Albanian grandmother who watched the performance said: "After watching this play, I thought of our past lives. People were so hardworking in the past, and today we have a happy life, but we must not forget the past."

The chorus conductor of the Albanian National Opera and Ballet Theater said: "I see that our performers are performing from the heart, full of revolutionary passion."

The Albanian comrades, in order to stage "The Red Detachment of Women" well, worked tirelessly with full political enthusiasm and initiative. Their daily workload was quite large, and many performers even worked while sick. However, they never complained about hardship or fatigue. Sometimes, to master a Chinese dance technique or to accurately perform a military action, they practiced over and over again. They paid great attention to embodying the revolutionary spirit of the Red Detachment of Women and the Red Army, striving to make themselves like soldiers. Sometimes, to inspire their revolutionary feelings, they would sing Albanian revolutionary songs before rehearsals. They also invited Albanian revolutionary veterans to tell revolutionary stories, invited Albanian soldiers to watch the rehearsals, and asked for their opinions, and often read magazines reflecting the Chinese revolution.

The chief violinist had a bad back, but he insisted on working while sick. He told us: "For the sake of performing a Chinese revolutionary play, I am not afraid of anything."

The Albanian stage workers, responsible for props, costumes, and makeup, voluntarily increased their working hours to ensure that "The Red Detachment of Women" could meet the audience as soon as possible. The costume workers sometimes worked continuously for twelve hours, sometimes bringing their meals to the theater to eat.

The costume worker, Comrade Yulia, after watching the performance, told us: "Excellent, such a wonderful show! We completely understood it and were deeply moved. We are really willing to do everything best for you..."

The Albanian comrades have such revolutionary feelings for the Chinese revolutionary ballet. Why do they love "The Red Detachment of Women" so much? Because the heroic Albanian people love revolutionary art, and "The Red Detachment of Women" exactly reflects the armed struggle of our people under the leadership of Chairman Mao, embodies Chairman Mao's great thought of people's war, and shows the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. The Albanian comrades enthusiastically hail the great thought of Mao Zedong.

Through the performance of "The Red Detachment of Women," the Albanian comrades repeatedly expressed: "We also want to quickly stage a revolutionary ballet reflecting our own national revolution." We are fully confident that the Albanian comrades will stage more and better revolutionary ballets.

The performers are very fond of China and all hope to visit China. Sojitza Harcho said: "When we go to China, we want to go deep into the countryside and factories to see how you combine with the workers and peasants."

Many Albanian comrades engaged in literary and artistic work have responded to the call of the Albanian Labor Party this year to go to the countryside to participate in labor and immerse themselves in life. We warmly hope that our fellow fighters will achieve greater success in revolutionary practice and on the road to the revolutionization of ballet.

    革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》在阿尔巴尼亚
    蒋祖慧　张策
    我国第一个革命的芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》的诞生，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是毛主席为工农兵服务的文艺思想的伟大胜利。它的诞生，像春雷一声响，震撼了几百年来为宫廷贵族和资产阶级老爷、少爷、小姐服务的芭蕾舞艺术，为腐朽、没落、僵死的芭蕾舞艺术敲响了丧钟！“洋为中用”，这是伟大的领袖毛主席给我们指出的方向。改造世界古老的芭蕾舞艺术，使之为无产阶级政治服务的时代已经到来了。芭蕾舞要表现我们伟大的时代，歌颂我们无产阶级的英雄人物，工农兵要占领芭蕾舞艺术舞台。
    革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》的诞生，具有划时代的意义。它受到了广大工农兵群众和世界上一切革命的朋友的热烈拥护和赞扬。
    欧洲伟大的社会主义明灯——英雄的阿尔巴尼亚，在今年排练上演了我国革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》。
    中阿两国人民的共同革命理想，把我们紧紧地团结在一起，在芭蕾舞革命化的道路上，我们又在一起并肩战斗。这是中阿两国文艺工作者战斗友谊的结晶。
    《红色娘子军》在阿尔巴尼亚，只经过短短五个月的排练，就与英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民见面了。为了排演中国第一个革命的芭蕾舞剧，他们集中了全国最优秀的歌剧芭蕾舞剧演员。演员们为此放弃了假期，热情期待中国同志的到来。从阿尔巴尼亚文艺领导部门到剧院领导，都为了能顺利排出《红色娘子军》，提供了一切便利条件。阿尔巴尼亚人民是非常热爱《红色娘子军》的，他们都认为革命的芭蕾舞剧好得很！
    扮演女主角的演员索伊察·哈尔乔同志，她出身很苦，母亲牺牲在监狱里。她小时候也坐过监狱，一直在孤儿院长大。她说：“我就喜欢演这样的戏。过去演的芭蕾舞尽是王子、小姐，我们又不是皇帝、皇后，体会不了他们的感情。现在演革命戏，就有可能体会工农群众的感情，能找到生活的根据。”
    有一位普通的阿尔巴尼亚老大娘看了戏说：“看了这个戏，就想到了我们过去的生活。过去的人们多艰苦呵，今天过了幸福的生活，可不能忘记了过去。”
    阿尔巴尼亚国家歌剧芭蕾舞剧院的合唱指挥说：“我看到我们的演员发自内心的表演，充满了革命的激情。”
    阿尔巴尼亚的同志们为了排好《红色娘子军》，废寝忘食，以饱满的政治热情和积极性投入排练，每天的劳动量是相当大的，甚至有许多演员带病工作。但是，他们从来没有叫过苦，喊过累。有时，为了学会一个中国的舞蹈技巧，为了准确地做好一个军事动作，一遍又一遍地反复练习。他们非常重视体现娘子军和红军的革命气质，努力使自己像一个战士。有时，为了启发自己的革命感情，排练前列队唱阿尔巴尼亚革命歌曲。他们还请阿尔巴尼亚革命前辈们讲革命故事，请阿尔巴尼亚战士们看排练，请他们提意见，并且经常找一些反映中国革命的画报来阅读。
    首席小提琴手的腰坏了，但是他一直坚持带病工作。他对我们说：“为了演中国的革命戏，我是什么也不怕的。”
    阿尔巴尼亚舞台工作人员，负责道具、服装、化妆的同志，为了能让《红色娘子军》早日和观众见面，他们自愿增加工作时间。服装工人同志有时连续工作达十二小时之久，有时把饭带到剧场来吃。
    服装工人尤莉雅同志，看了戏以后对我们说：“好极了，这么好的节目！我们完全看懂了，特别受感动。我们真是愿意为你们做一切一切最好的东西。……”
    阿尔巴尼亚的同志对中国的革命芭蕾舞剧就是这样充满了革命的感情。他们为什么这样热爱《红色娘子军》呢？因为英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民热爱革命的艺术，而《红色娘子军》正是反映了我国人民在毛主席领导下的武装斗争，表现了毛主席的伟大的人民战争思想，显示了无产阶级的革命精神。阿尔巴尼亚的同志热烈地欢呼伟大的毛泽东思想。
    通过《红色娘子军》的上演，阿尔巴尼亚的同志一再表示：“我们也要尽快排出反映自己民族的革命芭蕾舞剧。”我们完全相信阿尔巴尼亚同志一定会排出更多、更好的革命芭蕾舞剧。
    演员同志们对中国是非常热爱的，他们都希望到中国来访问。索伊察·哈尔乔说：“我们去中国，要深入到农村、工厂去，看看你们是怎么和工农结合的。”
    阿尔巴尼亚的许多从事文艺工作的同志们，今年已经响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的号召，到农村去参加劳动，深入生活。我们热烈地期望同行的战友们一定会在革命的实践中，在芭蕾舞革命化的道路上获得更大的成绩。（附图片）
