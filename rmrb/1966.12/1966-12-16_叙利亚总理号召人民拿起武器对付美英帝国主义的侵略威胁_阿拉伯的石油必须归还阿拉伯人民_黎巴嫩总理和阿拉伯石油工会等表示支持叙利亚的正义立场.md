	Syrian Prime Minister Calls on People to Take Up Arms Against US and British Imperialist Aggression Threats
	Arab Oil Must Be Returned to the Arab People
	Lebanese Prime Minister and Arab Oil Union Express Support for Syria's Just Stance

	BEIRUT, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) — In recent days, governments and people of Syria and other countries have strongly condemned the provocations by the "Iraq Petroleum Company."

	As previously reported, the "Iraq Petroleum Company," owned by British, American, French, and Dutch capital, is a foreign company that exploits and plunders oil in Iraq. It uses pipelines laid across Syrian territory to transport Iraqi oil to the Mediterranean for export. Because this oil company unreasonably withheld the transit tax it owed to Syria and refused Syria's demand to increase the transit tax, the Syrian government recently decided to seize all the assets of this foreign oil company in Syria. After this, the oil company stopped transporting oil to Syria's Baniyas and Lebanon's Tripoli, threatening the Syrian people and other Arab people.

	Syrian Prime Minister Yusuf Zu'ayyin said in Aleppo on the 14th that the oil companies of the United States, Britain, and other countries use oil as a tool to enslave people. He said, "We will never give up the rights of the people, nor will we trade the rights of the people with others. 'Unless the will of the people is realized, we will not retreat. Oil must be returned to the people!' He also called on the people to take up arms and fight against Zionism, colonialism, foreign oil companies, and all enemies.

	Syrian Vice Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Yusuf Zu'ayyin recently announced in Cairo, "If the 'Iraq Petroleum Company' attempts to create another Suez Canal incident, we are already prepared to deal with any possible situation."

	Syrian Minister of Information Zuwayyin said in Algeria: Syria's measures are in line with the rights of the Syrian people. The days when foreign companies do as they please are gone forever.

	Syrian National Security Chief Abdul Karim Junadi said: "The Syrian government is not afraid of the Western countries and their threats standing behind the company. Let the United States and Britain bring their fleets, they will be wrecked."

	Syrian General Federation of Trade Unions Chairman Khalid Junadi reminded people of the pressure and open interference the United States is exerting on Syria. He pointed out that the United States will suffer a crushing defeat on this issue.

	Lebanese Prime Minister Rashid Karami expressed support for Syria's measures. When he met with the representative of the "Iraq Petroleum Company" in Lebanon, he pointed out that the oil company is responsible for the incident.

	The Arab Oil Union sent a telegram supporting Syria's measures and condemning the stubborn stance of the "Iraq Petroleum Company." Iraqi workers also sent a telegram supporting Syria's just stance.

    叙利亚总理号召人民拿起武器对付美英帝国主义的侵略威胁
    阿拉伯的石油必须归还阿拉伯人民
    黎巴嫩总理和阿拉伯石油工会等表示支持叙利亚的正义立场
    新华社大马士革十四日电　连日来，叙利亚等国政府和人民纷纷强烈谴责“伊拉克石油公司”向阿拉伯人民挑衅。
    前已报道，由英国、美国、法国和荷兰的资本所拥有的“伊拉克石油公司”是在伊拉克开采和掠夺石油的外国公司。它通过铺设在叙利亚领土上的输油管，把伊拉克的石油输向地中海出口。由于这家石油公司无理拖欠向叙利亚交付石油过境税，并拒绝叙利亚提出的增加石油过境税的要求，叙利亚政府最近决定没收这家外国石油公司在叙利亚的全部财产。在这以后，石油公司中断向叙利亚的巴尼亚斯和黎巴嫩的的黎波里输送石油，对叙利亚人民和其他阿拉伯人民进行威胁。
    叙利亚总理扎因十四日在阿勒颇谴责美英等国的石油公司把石油作为奴役人民的工具。他说：“我们决不放弃人民的权利，也决不拿人民的权利同别人作交易。”“除非人民的愿望实现，我们决不让步。石油必须归还给人民！”他还号召人民拿起武器，同犹太主义、殖民主义和外国石油公司等一切敌人作战。
    叙利亚副总理兼外交部长马胡斯最近在开罗宣布：“如果‘伊拉克石油公司’企图制造另一次苏伊士运河事件，我们已经准备好对付任何可能发生的事情。”
    叙利亚新闻部长祖瓦比在阿尔及利亚说：叙利亚采取的措施是符合叙利亚人民的权利的。外国公司为所欲为的日子已经一去不复返了。
    叙利亚国家安全负责人阿卜杜勒·卡里姆·琼迪表示：“叙利亚政府不怕站在公司背后的西方国家和它们的威胁。让美国和英国把他们的舰队开来吧，它们将要触礁而毁灭。”
    叙利亚工会总联合会主席哈利德·琼迪提醒人们注意美国对叙利亚施加的压力和公开干涉。他指出，美国将在这个问题上遭到惨败。
    黎巴嫩总理卡拉米表示支持叙利亚的措施。他在召见“伊拉克石油公司”在黎巴嫩的代表时指出，石油公司要对发生的事件负责。
    阿拉伯石油工会打电报支持叙利亚采取的措施，并且谴责“伊拉克石油公司”的顽固立场。伊拉克的工人也打电报支持叙利亚的正义立场。
