The heroic South Vietnamese Liberation Army launched a fierce artillery barrage on the U.S. airbase at Bien Hoa near Saigon early on the morning of December 4, and blew up a U.S. military building in the heart of Saigon, delivering a heavy blow to the American aggressors.

According to Western news agencies, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, at 1:30 a.m. on December 4, rained "a storm of artillery fire" on the U.S. airbase at Bien Hoa on the outskirts of Saigon for more than an hour. Following this, U.S. authorities immediately sealed off the base, barring journalists and all others from entering, and refused to disclose the number of U.S. casualties or the extent of the damage. However, Western news agency reporters said that during the Liberation Army's bombardment, the base was rocked by "thunderous explosions."

The Bien Hoa airbase is one of the largest U.S. bases in South Vietnam, housing about 20,000 U.S. airmen and usually at least 300 aircraft. On April 13 of this year, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army launched a fierce assault on this base, destroying or damaging 67 enemy aircraft, killing or wounding 300 U.S. airmen, and burning down a large fuel depot.

Three hours after the Liberation Army's bombardment of the Bien Hoa base, as the American aggressors were still reeling from the shock, they blew up a U.S. military building in the center of Saigon. This building housed the headquarters of the U.S. Army Psychological Warfare Division in South Vietnam, with another part serving as U.S. military quarters. Western news agencies reported that the building was blown apart from the basement to the roof, with "large beams lying across desks and beds." Some U.S. military personnel living in the building were injured. Even the windows of the adjacent U.S. Agency for International Development office in Saigon were shattered. U.S. "Ambassador" to Saigon, Lodge, hurried to the scene afterward, surveying the ruined building. Lodge, with a worried frown, said, "These attacks are obviously coordinated," "We have no way to protect ourselves from such things."

The glorious victories of the North Vietnamese military and people in striking back at the American aggressors on December 2, and the new victories of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army in Saigon, show that any new crimes committed by the American aggressors will inevitably be met with double the punishment from the Vietnamese military and people.

    南越解放军严惩美国强盗
    猛轰新山一美空军基地　炸毁西贡市区美军大厦
    新华社四日讯　西贡消息：英雄的越南南方解放军在四日清晨以猛烈的炮火轰击了西贡新山一美国空军基地，并在西贡市区炸毁一座美军大厦，给美国侵略强盗以沉重打击。
    据西方通讯社报道，越南南方解放军在四日清晨一点三十分，以“像雨点般的炮火”，对西贡市郊的新山一美国空军基地，进行了持续一个多小时的猛烈轰击。在这之后，美军当局立即封锁了这个基地，禁止新闻记者和其他一切人入内，并拒不透露美军的伤亡和基地被毁的情况。但是据西方通讯社记者说，在解放军进行轰击时，这个基地里发生了“雷鸣般的爆炸声”。
    新山一空军基地是美国在南越的最大的基地之一，驻有约两万名美国空军人员，通常至少有三百架飞机驻扎在这个基地上。今年四月十三日，越南南方解放军曾猛烈地袭击了这个基地，击毁、击伤敌机六十七架，打死打伤美国空军人员三百名，并烧毁大型油库一座。
    越南南方解放军四日在猛轰新山一基地之后三小时，乘美国强盗惊魂未定，又在西贡市中心区炸毁了一座美军大厦。这个大厦是南越的美国陆军心理战部队总部，它的另一部分是美军宿舍。西方通讯社说，这座建筑物从底层到屋顶被炸穿了，“屋顶被炸飞了，写字台上和床上横七竖八地压着大块的梁木。”住在这个大厦里的一些美军人员受到伤亡。连毗邻的美国国际开发署驻西贡分署的窗子也都被炸碎了。美国驻西贡“大使”洛奇事后急忙赶到现场，凭吊这个被炸毁的废墟。洛奇愁眉苦脸地说，“这些袭击肯定是互相配合的”，“我们没有办法保护自己不遇到这种事情。”
