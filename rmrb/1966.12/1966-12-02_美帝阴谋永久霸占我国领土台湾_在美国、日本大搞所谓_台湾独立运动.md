The U.S. imperialists, in collusion with their followers, are vigorously promoting the "two Chinas" scheme at the United Nations General Assembly. At the same time, they are instigating a small group of pro-American traitors in the United States and Japan to engage in so-called "Taiwan independence movements," with the aim of permanently occupying China's Taiwan Province.

According to a Reuters report, five pro-American traitorous groups, nurtured by U.S. imperialism, used an entire half-page of the November 20 issue of *The New York Times* to publish an advertisement. They shouted slogans such as "Formosa (referring to Taiwan) belongs to the people of Formosa. We demand that our will be used as a guide to determine the future status of our home island." This small group of extreme pro-American traitors even openly called for "Formosa to become an independent entity, and it is necessary to have a new government" to reflect their views. Before this, U.S. imperialism openly distributed forms to overseas Chinese in the United States to "solicit" their opinions on "Taiwan independence," inciting overseas Chinese to betray their own country.

According to a Reuters report, U.S. imperialism also colluded with the reactionary Sato government of Japan, which seeks to re-occupy China's Taiwan Province. They directed dozens of pro-American traitors to stage a "demonstration" on the streets of Tokyo on November 21, "demanding Taiwan independence." They also established a so-called "Chinese Revival Alliance" in Tokyo. In early October of this year, U.S. imperialism dispatched its nurtured pro-American traitors, including Xie Fuya, from New York to Tokyo to convene the "first meeting of representatives" of the "Chinese Revival Alliance." After the meeting, they issued a "declaration" in accordance with the instructions of U.S. imperialism.

    美帝阴谋永久霸占我国领土台湾
    在美国、日本大搞所谓“台湾独立运动”
    据新华社二十九日讯  美帝国主义纠合它的追随者在联合国大会上竭力推行“两个中国”阴谋的同时，又唆使一小撮亲美卖国分子，在美国、日本等地大搞所谓“台湾独立运动”，妄图永久霸占我国领土台湾省。
    据美联社透露，美帝国主义豢养的五个亲美叛国小集团，利用十一月二十日《纽约时报》的整整半个版，大登广告。叫嚷什么“福摩萨（指台湾）是属于福摩萨人的。我们要求把我们的意愿，作为决定我们家乡那个海岛未来地位的指南”。这一小撮极端亲美叛国分子还公然叫喊，要“福摩萨成为一个独立的单位，必要有一个新的政府”来反映它们的意见。在此之前，美帝国主义还公开散发表格，向旅居美国的华侨“征求”关于“台湾独立的意见”，策动华侨背叛自己的祖国。
    另据路透社的消息透露，美帝国主义还勾结妄图重新染指我国领土台湾省的日本佐藤反动政府，指使几十个亲美叛国分子，于十一月二十一日在日本东京街头“示威”，“要求台湾独立”。还在东京成立了一个所谓“中国复兴同盟”。今年十月初，美帝国主义并指派它豢养的亲美卖国分子谢扶雅等人，从纽约赶到东京召开“中国复兴同盟”的“第一次要员代表大会”，会后，还按美帝国主义的意旨发表了“宣言”。
