One day, after returning from digging a river, I saw on the work points board that my family had only contributed thirty points of manure. I was puzzled: my family had accumulated quite a bit of manure! How could it only be this little? When I asked my wife, I found out that my father had taken the good manure to our private plot. I heard this and immediately got angry, thinking about going to pull the manure back from the private plot; but then I thought, if I do this, my father definitely won't agree. Since he has already taken it, I'll just let it go this time. But my heart was still uneasy. At this moment, the golden words of Chairman Mao's Quotations flashed before my eyes: "We all should learn from him, who has no selfishness and no personal gain. From this point of view, one can become a person who is greatly beneficial to the people." Chairman Mao's words immediately made me see things clearly. I thought, Chairman Mao wants us to have no selfishness and no personal gain, but my family took the good manure to the private plot and did not give it to the collective, isn't this selfishness and personal gain? A few carts of manure, it seems, are not a big deal, but whether to take it to the private plot first or to the collective's field first, this is a manifestation of two different class thoughts and two different paths, and it cannot be easily overlooked. At this moment, I felt my face burning hot, and my body was filled with boundless strength. So, I pulled the cart and took the fifteen carts of manure piled in the private plot to the collective's corn high-yield field. Although I was sweating all over, my heart was filled with indescribable joy. I felt that what I brought back was not just a few carts of manure, but more importantly, I brought back the spirit of "having no selfishness and no personal gain" of communism.

The next day, my father found out and was so angry that he didn't even eat his meal, shouting and scolding at me. I patiently persuaded and educated him, and together we studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune." I explained to him that Comrade Norman Bethune was a Canadian communist who, to help the Chinese people defeat Japanese imperialism, crossed the ocean to come to China and dedicated his life to the revolutionary cause of China. My father excitedly said, "Comrade Norman Bethune is truly a good person!"

Then, I told him, why is Comrade Norman Bethune so good? It is because he has internationalism and communism, with no selfishness and no personal gain. Now our lives are better, but we cannot just think of our own family, forgetting the seven hundred million people, forgetting that there are still three-quarters of the world's class brothers suffering. Like us, accumulating a little manure, still reluctant to give it to the collective, only thinking of our two mu of private plot, think about it, how heavy our selfishness is! I spoke very excitedly, and he listened very seriously. Finally, he said with shame, "I was wrong, in the future I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, learn from Comrade Norman Bethune, and become a person with no selfishness and no personal gain."

This incident taught me a lot. It made me more clearly understand that in the face of an event, whether it is for the public or for the private, this is the fundamental opposition of the worldview of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Selfishness is the great enemy of the revolution. The more selfishness a person has, the less revolutionary spirit they have. One must bit by bit uproot selfishness. The more thoroughly one uproots selfishness, the more firmly the spirit of public service will stand, and the greater the contribution to the revolution will be.

	Certain comrades from the First Platoon of a certain regiment, during the autumn harvest and autumn planting, used their rest time to help community members study the "Three Articles" and spread Mao Zedong Thought.

    私心挖得越彻底“公”字树得越牢固
    陈洪全
    一天，我挖河回来，看到工分榜上我家只交了三十分的粪肥，心里很纳闷：我家积的粪不少啊！怎么才交了这么一点点？回家问我爱人，才知道是我父亲把好粪都送到自留地里去了。我一听，就火了，想拉起车子到自留地里把粪拉回来；又一想，这样做，父亲肯定不同意，他既然已经拉去了，就迁就他这一次吧！可是，我心里老是不安稳。这时，金光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，闪现在我的眼前：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。”毛主席的话，顿时使我心明眼亮。我想，毛主席要我们毫无自私自利之心，而我家把好粪送到自留地里，不交给集体，这不是自私自利之心又是什么？几车粪，看起来不是什么了不起的事，可是，是先送到自留地里，还是先送到集体的地里，这是两种不同阶级的思想、两条不同道路的表现，绝不能轻易放过。这时我觉得脸上热呼呼的，身上增添了无穷的力量。于是，我拉起车子，把堆在自留地里的十五车粪，全部拉到队里的玉米丰产田里。虽然累得满头大汗，但是心里却有说不出来的高兴。我觉得，拉回来的不仅仅是几车子粪，更重要的是拉回了“毫无自私自利之心”的共产主义思想。
    第二天，父亲知道以后，气得连饭也不吃了，冲着我又嚷又骂。我就耐心地说服教育他，并且和他一起学习了《纪念白求恩》。我给他解释说，白求恩同志是一个加拿大共产党员，为了帮助中国人民打败日本帝国主义，他远渡重洋，来到中国，把自己一生献给了中国的革命事业。我父亲激动地说：“人家白求恩同志，可真是个好人啊！”
    接着，我又告诉他，白求恩同志为什么这样好？就是因为他有国际主义精神，有共产主义精神，毫无自私自利之心。我们现在生活好了，可不能只顾自己的一个家，忘了七亿人民，忘了世界上还有三分之二受苦受难的阶级兄弟。像我们这样，积点好粪，还舍不得交给集体，只顾自己的那二分自留地，你想想，咱们的私心多重啊！我说得很激动，他听得也很认真。最后，他惭愧地说：“是我做错了，今后我一定听毛主席他老人家的话，向白求恩同志学习，做一个毫无自私自利之心的人。”
    这件事对我教育很大，它使我更加明确地认识到：一事当前，是为公还是为私，这是无产阶级和资产阶级两种根本对立的世界观。私心是革命的大敌。一个人私心多一分，革命精神就少一分，必须一点一滴地把私心挖干净。私心挖得越彻底，“公”字树立得越牢固，对革命的贡献也就会越大。（附图片）
