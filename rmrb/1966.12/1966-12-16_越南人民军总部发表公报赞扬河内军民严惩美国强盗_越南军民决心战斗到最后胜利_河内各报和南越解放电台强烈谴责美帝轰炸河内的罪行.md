The Vietnamese People's Army Headquarters issued a statement praising Hanoi military and civilians for punishing American aggressors. The Vietnamese military and civilians are determined to fight to the final victory. Hanoi newspapers and the South Vietnamese Liberation Radio Station strongly condemn the U.S. imperialist bombing of Hanoi.

The General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army issued a statement on December 14, strongly condemning the criminal acts of U.S. aggressor planes that have continuously bombed the city of Hanoi and highly praising the heroic struggle of Hanoi military and civilians, who have achieved a great victory by shooting down eight enemy planes.

The statement said that since early December, the U.S. aggressors have madly expanded their aggressive war, sending planes to attack the residential areas of Hanoi four times. The new crimes of U.S. imperialism have further deepened the Vietnamese people's hatred for it.

The statement said that the military and civilians of Hanoi have resolutely punished the aggressors.

The statement said that although U.S. imperialism has suffered heavy defeats, it will still play vicious and cunning tricks.

The statement pointed out that the entire Vietnamese military and civilians resolutely respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to fight, bravely advance, and are determined to fight to the final victory.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 15, the Hanoi Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front held an emergency expanded meeting on the evening of December 14, strongly condemning the serious aggressive crimes of U.S. aggressors who have continuously and savagely bombed the city of Hanoi. It called on the military and civilians of Hanoi to resolutely implement Chairman Ho's sacred call to resist the Americans and save the country, overcome all difficulties, make every sacrifice, unite and fight, defend the capital, and are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors.

Nguyen Van Hieu, Chairman of the Hanoi Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front, pointed out at the meeting that the heinous crimes committed by U.S. aggressor planes in bombing Hanoi in recent days are acts of desperation by U.S. imperialism. The mad "escalation" of the war by U.S. imperialism will absolutely not frighten the people of Hanoi, but will instead arouse the people of Hanoi's hatred for them, making the Vietnamese people more determined to defeat them.

The statement said that to defend the capital, the military and civilians of Hanoi are determined to use all their strength and wisdom to strike at the U.S. aggressors. No matter what modern weapons they use, or what savage and cunning means they employ, even if they destroy the capital Hanoi, the military and civilians of Hanoi are determined to overcome all difficulties and hardships, make every sacrifice, and resolutely implement the sacred call of our beloved Chairman Ho to resist the Americans and save the country.

The statement called on the military and civilians of Hanoi: For the independence and freedom of the motherland, for the happiness and future of the nation, concentrate all forces, continuously strengthen the fighting unity, and together with all compatriots across the country, be determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors and unify the motherland.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 15, Hanoi newspapers published editorials on December 15, strongly condemning the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism in continuously sending aggressor planes to bomb the city of Hanoi, and calling on the Vietnamese military and civilians to resolutely and thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors.

The editorial of "People's Daily" said, "The U.S. aggressors invading our beloved capital cannot frighten us. On the contrary, the hatred and anger of our people are burning more fiercely, and our people's fighting determination is more resolute." The editorial said that the mad actions of the U.S. aggressors further indicate that they are suffering heavy defeats. On all battlefields across the South, the U.S. invading army and the puppet army are being defeated.

The editorial warmly applauded the glorious victory of Hanoi military and civilians in shooting down eight U.S. aggressor planes on December 14, saying, "The entire city of Hanoi is fighting strongly. Hanoi is a great steel fortress, a great fire net, and will definitely burn the U.S. aggressors to ashes."

The editorial called on the 31 million Vietnamese military and civilians to further enhance their fighting will, resolutely and thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors, and achieve greater victories.

The editorial of "People's Army" quoted a passage from Chairman Ho Chi Minh: "Hanoi, Haiphong, and other cities and enterprises may be destroyed, but the Vietnamese people will not be frightened! Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom. When the day of victory comes, our people will rebuild our motherland more magnificently and more splendidly!" The editorial continued, "The fighting will of the Vietnamese people is firmer than steel, and their belief in final victory is firmer than the Truong Son Mountains."

The editorial said, "For the victory of the cause of resisting the Americans and saving the country, for the future of our descendants, for the fulfillment of the glorious national duty and international duty, all our military and civilians are advancing with the momentum of surging waves, overcoming all difficulties, and giving the U.S. aggressors a fatal blow, smashing their aggressive ambitions, and completing our national historical mission."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 15, the South Vietnamese Liberation Radio Station issued a commentary on December 14, saying that the U.S. aggressors' continuous savage bombing of Hanoi is a very serious "escalation" of the war by U.S. imperialism, and is a beastly mad action taken by them in the face of their defeat in South Vietnam.

The commentary said that the military and civilians of the South are extremely indignant at the U.S. aggressors' blatant bombing of Hanoi. The commentary said that on the entire battlefield in the South, a wave of competition to kill the enemy and win merits has been set off. The military and civilians of the South have, through their actual actions, once again warned U.S. imperialism: Its any "escalation" actions will not only not frighten the Vietnamese people, but will also hinder the mutual support between the North and South of Vietnam. Instead, the hatred and anger of the Vietnamese people will burn more fiercely, and the U.S. aggressors will be burned to ashes even faster.

	Vietnamese self-defense forces closely watch the sky, ready to destroy any invading U.S. planes at any time.
