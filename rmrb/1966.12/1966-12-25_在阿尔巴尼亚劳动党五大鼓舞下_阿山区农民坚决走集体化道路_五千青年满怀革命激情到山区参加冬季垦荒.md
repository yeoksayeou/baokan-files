Individual farmers in the mountainous and hilly regions of Albania, inspired by the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour, have heightened their socialist consciousness and continue to enthusiastically take the path of agricultural collectivization.

In the 35 days following the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour, 37 new agricultural cooperatives were established in the Mirdita region, achieving full collectivization in the entire region.

In the 40 days following the Fifth Congress, 50 new agricultural cooperatives were established in the Peshkopi region. Currently, farmers in villages that have not yet established cooperatives have expressed their desire to form cooperatives and are actively preparing for their establishment.

Recently, all farmers in the Kashnjete village of the Lezha region have joined agricultural cooperatives. As of now, 98% of households in the Lezha region have joined cooperatives.

Recently, 30 new agricultural cooperatives were established in the Shkodra region. The Tropoja region also recently established 9 new cooperatives, achieving full collectivization in the entire region. Farmers in 16 villages in the hilly areas of the Tirana region have also joined agricultural cooperatives. Additionally, some villages in the Peshkopi and Mat regions that have not yet been organized are also taking the path of collectivization.

During the process of taking the path of collectivization, individual farmers in various regions, in accordance with the spirit of the Fifth Congress, have strongly criticized the fallacy that "mountainous regions cannot be collectivized."

According to a report from Tirana on December 22, more than 5,000 Albanian youths have enthusiastically responded to the call from the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour to "go to the hills and mountains, beautify the hills and mountains, and make them as fertile as the plains." Recently, they have left cities and plains with revolutionary enthusiasm to participate in the winter land reclamation movement in the high mountains and hilly regions. One hundred and sixty youths from the Rapadhase Agricultural Cooperative in the Berat region were the first to propose going to the mountains to reclaim land for a month and formed a reclamation team to go to Mount Terpan. This initiative has been enthusiastically supported by youths from all over the country and has been highly valued and praised by the Party and the state.
