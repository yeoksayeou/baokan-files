Chairman Mao says: The Chinese people have the spirit and the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future.

Two drilling teams in Daqing have jointly created a new world record by breaking the 100,000-meter mark. Workers wave the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to celebrate another brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The achievements of these two drilling teams far exceed the Soviet Union's record of 40,816 meters and the United States' world record of 90,325 meters.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 27th, as the third Five-Year Plan of our country is about to successfully conclude its first year, and a new high tide of the Cultural Revolution of the industrial and mining proletariat is rising nationwide, exciting news has come from the frontline of China's petroleum industry: Under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, two drilling teams in the Daqing Oilfield have jointly created a new world record—within eleven months and five days, both teams have broken through the 100,000-meter mark in drilling, far exceeding the record of 40,816 meters set by a Soviet drilling team in one year, and also surpassing the world record of 90,325 meters set by an American drilling team in one year.

This record was created by the "Five Good Red Flag" teams of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, the 1202 and 1205 drilling teams of the Daqing Oilfield, thus achieving their self-proposed combat goal of catching up with and surpassing the world's advanced level ahead of schedule. The drilling rigs they used are all domestically produced. This great achievement marks another significant step forward in China's drilling technology. The total drilling footage of these two teams this year is equivalent to four times their total drilling footage of last year. The total drilling footage of one team in a year is even more than the total drilling footage of the old Chinese petroleum industry over 42 years. The quality of all the wells drilled by the two teams is qualified, with a full-optimization rate of 99.4%.

On the morning of December 26 at 5:50, when the last drill pipe of the two drilling teams reached the 100,000-meter mark, the drilling site immediately erupted with shouts of "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" and "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Workers waved the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," cheered, and jumped in joy, celebrating another brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought. That afternoon, representatives from various fronts of the oilfield and Red Guards, beating drums and gongs, went to the 1202 and 1205 drilling teams to congratulate the heroes who created the new record of 100,000 meters in drilling. Red Guard representatives pinned badges of Chairman Mao's quotations and portraits on the workers of the two teams. At this moment, the entire scene was filled with high spirits, and everyone sang "The East Is Red" in unison. The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" echoed again across the oilfield.

At the beginning of this year, the workers of the 1202 and 1205 drilling teams, who have repeatedly achieved victories on the petroleum drilling front, set a combat goal of drilling 50,000 meters per year with the ambition to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level. On January 21, while people were celebrating the 1966 Spring Festival, the workers of the drilling teams braved the cold, pushed the drilling rigs, and fired the first shot of 1966. They have consistently prioritized studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in all their work, treating the drilling site as a battlefield to fight against U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and advancing into the strata second by second. As a result, in less than seven months, by mid-August, they had fulfilled their promises ahead of schedule, both drilling 50,000 meters, with all wells of full-optimized quality, far surpassing the record of 40,816 meters set by the Soviet Union's Polonskiy drilling team in 1965.

In the face of this great victory, the workers of the two drilling teams remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, "Modesty helps one go forward, whereas conceit makes one lag behind," and remained humble and cautious, determined to "start anew from the beginning" and "start from zero." They decided to study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, learn a new level, and achieve a new level in drilling, striving for a higher level. At the meeting celebrating the two drilling teams' achievement of the 50,000-meter mark, the oilfield party committee gave each worker of the two teams a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." After receiving these four shining gold books, the workers studied Chairman Mao's works even more seriously and diligently. Workers brought the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the drilling site before and after work, turning pre-shift and post-shift meetings into sessions for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, ensuring that they followed Chairman Mao's instructions in production and summarized work according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Workers drew boundless wisdom and strength from Chairman Mao's works, treating production battles as political battles, determined to overcome all difficulties, resulting in faster drilling progress month by month and better quality. Less than two months after climbing the 50,000-meter peak, the drilling footage of both teams reached the 70,000-meter level.

Just as they achieved this glorious feat, our great leader Chairman Mao, on National Day, received representatives from the two drilling teams on Tiananmen Rostrum. This great piece of news brought immense encouragement to all the workers of the two teams. They decided to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, and strive for greater achievements to report to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. On that day, at the mass rally held in the oilfield to celebrate National Day, representatives from the two teams received a banner reading "Drill 100,000 meters per year, surpass the U.S. imperialists and be invincible" from the oilfield party committee and marched towards the 100,000-meter peak.

In their march towards the 100,000-meter peak, they enthusiastically responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, treating the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, fighting against the "I" in their hearts, and carrying out revolution in their souls. As a result, the revolutionary spirit of the workers was greatly inspired. The great spiritual power of Mao Zedong Thought quickly turned into great material power. Workers, following Chairman Mao's teachings in "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," summarized their past drilling experiences, based on regional characteristics, and developed a set of "fast, clever, fierce, and stable" eight-character drilling tactics, gradually mastering the freedom of drilling. Especially under the impetus of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, workers fearlessly broke through the bourgeois frame of mind, boldly carried out worker-designed plans, overcame numerous difficulties, and drilled into the strata at high speed and high quality, finally seizing the great victory of 100,000 meters in drilling on the eve of the new year.

When the workers of the two drilling teams discussed this great achievement, they unanimously pointed out that this is another brilliant victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought. They decided to continue advancing along the path indicated by Chairman Mao, creating even greater achievements for the people of our country. (Accompanying photos)

    毛主席说：中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。
    大庆两钻井队齐破十万米刷新世界纪录
    工人们挥舞着《毛主席语录》欢庆毛泽东思想的又一光辉胜利
    这两个钻井队双双创造的钻井成绩，大大超过了苏联四万零八百一十六米的纪录，和美国九万零三百二十五米的世界最高纪录。
    据新华社二十七日讯  在我国第三个五年计划第一年即将胜利结束，全国工矿企业无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮正在兴起的时候，我国石油工业战线传来一个振奋人心的喜讯：大庆油田有两个钻井队在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，最近又双双创造了一项世界最新纪录——在十一个月零五天的时间里，两个钻井队分别突破了钻井十万米的大关，大大超过了苏联一个钻井队创造的一年钻井四万零八百一十六米的纪录，也超过了美国一个钻井队创造的全年钻井九万零三百二十五米的世界最高纪录。
    这项纪录是由石油工业部五好红旗标兵、大庆油田1202和1205两个钻井队创造的，从而提前实现了他们自己提出的赶超世界先进水平的战斗目标。他们使用的钻机都是国产的。这一伟大成就，标志着我国钻井技术又向前迈进了一大步。这两个队今年钻井的总进尺，相当于他们去年钻井总进尺的四倍。一个队一年的总进尺比旧中国石油工业四十二年钻井的总进尺还要多。两个队所钻的井，口口质量合格，全优率达百分之九十九点四。
    十二月二十六日早晨五点五十分，当两个钻井队累计进尺十万米的最后一根钻杆钻进地层时，井场上立即爆发出“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声。工人们挥舞着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，欢呼跳跃，热烈庆祝毛泽东思想的又一光辉胜利。当天下午，油田各条战线上的职工代表和红卫兵代表敲锣打鼓，前去1202和1205两个钻井队，向创造钻井十万米新成就的英雄们祝贺，红卫兵代表给两个队的工人佩戴毛主席语录章和毛主席像章。这时全场情绪高昂，大伙齐声欢唱《大海航行靠舵手》。“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声，又一次在油田上空震荡。
    在石油钻井战线屡创战功的1202和1205钻井队的全体职工，今年年初就怀着赶超世界先进水平的雄心壮志，提出了年钻五万米的战斗目标。一月二十一日，正当人们欢度一九六六年春节的时候，钻井队的工人们就冒着严寒，推动钻机，打响了一九六六年的第一炮。他们一直坚持把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，把井场当成向美帝苏修开炮的战场，争分夺秒地向地层进军，结果只用了不到七个月的时间，在八月中旬就提前实现了自己的诺言，双双胜利钻进五万米，口口井质量全优，远远超过了苏联一九六五年公布的波良可夫斯基钻井队创造的全年钻井四万零八百一十六米的纪录。
    在这个巨大的胜利面前，两个钻井队的职工牢记毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，戒骄戒躁，决心“而今迈步从头越”，从零开始，决心更加刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，学出一个新水平，用出一个新水平，在钻井上打出一个更高的水平。在庆贺两个钻井队登上钻井五万米高峰的大会上，油田党委给这两个队的职工每人发了一套《毛泽东选集》。职工们得到这四本金光闪闪的宝书以后，更加认真地、刻苦地学习毛主席著作。职工们上班时带着《毛主席语录》到井场，把班前班后会变成活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会，做到在班上按照毛主席指示办事，搞好生产；下班后按照毛主席指示总结工作。职工们从毛主席著作中汲取了无穷的智慧和力量，把生产仗当作政治仗打，下定决心，排除一切困难，结果，钻井进度一个月比一个月快，质量也越来越好。两个队攀登五万米高峰以后不到两个月，钻井总进尺都分别达到七万米的高水平。
    就在他们取得这个辉煌成就的时刻，我们伟大的领袖毛主席在国庆节那天，在天安门城楼上接见了这两个钻井队的代表。这个巨大的幸福的喜讯给两个队的全体职工带来了极大的鼓舞。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬“宜将剩勇追穷寇”的彻底革命精神，再攀高峰，以更大的成绩向毛主席和党中央报喜。就在这一天，在油田举行的庆祝国庆节的群众大会上，两个队的代表从油田党委接过一面“年钻十万米，超美帝全无敌”的进军旗，向十万米高峰前进。
    在向十万米高峰的进军中，他们热烈响应林彪同志关于把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段的号召，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，攻地层不忘斗“我”字，在灵魂深处闹革命。结果职工革命精神大振。毛泽东思想的伟大精神力量迅速变成了伟大的物质力量。职工们遵照毛主席在《实践论》和《矛盾论》中的教导，总结过去的打井经验，根据地区特点，摸索出一套“快打巧打，狠打稳打”的八字打井战术，逐步掌握了钻井的自由。特别是在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，职工们不怕鬼，不信邪，大破资产阶级的洋框框，大搞工人设计，冲破重重困难，高速度、高质量地向地层钻进，终于在新年前夕夺得了钻井十万米的巨大胜利。
    两个钻井队的职工在畅谈这一巨大成就时一致指出，这是伟大的毛泽东思想的又一光辉胜利。他们决心沿着毛主席指引的道路乘胜前进，为祖国人民创造更大成绩。（附图片）
