The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches the souls of people.

As the movement deepens, its scope becomes wider and it touches the souls of people more deeply.

Comrade Lin Biao said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to reform the souls of people and achieve the revolutionization of people's thoughts. To materialists, the soul is not some abstract and intangible thing, but a reflection of a certain social existence and class consciousness. In a class struggle society, everyone's soul is "stamped with the mark of class." Youths are no exception.

In this great revolution, millions of revolutionary young people have become brave pioneers. They have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the daring spirit of the proletarian revolutionary rebellion, and launched a fierce assault on the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, making great contributions and writing a brilliant chapter in the history of our country.

In the past, the "authorities" of the bourgeoisie poisoned the minds of the younger generation with decadent ideas, urging them to strive individually, to "make a name" and "build a family," and to shine on the "white expert" road. The call to arms of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has awakened the youth, and they have bravely thrown themselves into the revolutionary torrent, truly shining with the radiance of revolutionary youth!

The revolutionary storm has fiercely washed away the decadent forces of the exploiting classes and has also powerfully washed the younger generation. They grow and learn in class struggle, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in class struggle, which is something that cannot be learned by just studying in classrooms.

Youths are the most active and vigorous force in the whole society, with the least conservative ideas; their worldviews are in the process of formation. Today, standing in such a great revolutionary struggle, how to seize this great and precious moment, face the wind and rain, undergo tempering, and while transforming the objective world, transform the subjective world as well, is a question that every revolutionary youth must seriously consider.

Why is it that in the storms of struggle, some people have a clear direction, temper their revolutionary will, learn the skills of struggle, and make rapid progress; while others on the revolutionary road are unclear in direction, waver, and even fall behind? The key lies in the self-awareness of self-revolution.

With more self-awareness of revolution, one will seize the good opportunity to transform one's subjective world while transforming the objective world; with more blindness, one will miss the good opportunity and gain nothing in this great revolution, even making mistakes.

"Many things are urgent; the heavens and earth turn, time presses. Ten thousand years are too long, we strive for every moment." Our great leader Chairman Mao wrote these profound verses for us. In this revolutionary torrent that shakes the world, the changes of one day and one night often exceed those of twenty years in ordinary times. A self-aware revolutionary will surely, with the spirit of "striving for every moment," constantly absorb nourishment in the practice of revolutionary struggle and bravely accept the blows of wind and rain.

Let us seize this great and precious moment!

    把握伟大而珍贵的时刻
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命。
    随着运动的深入发展，它所触及的范围越来越广，触及人的灵魂越来越深。
    林彪同志说，无产阶级文化大革命，就是要改造人的灵魂，实现人的思想革命化。灵魂，对唯物主义者来说，并不是什么抽象的不可捉摸的东西，而是一定的社会存在和阶级意识的反映。在阶级斗争的社会里，每个人的灵魂都“打上阶级的烙印”。青年也不例外。
    在这场大革命中，千百万革命的青少年成为勇敢的闯将。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬了敢想敢干的无产阶级革命造反精神，向资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯猛烈冲击，做出了重大的贡献，在我国历史上写下了光辉的篇章。
    过去，资产阶级的“权威”以腐朽的思想毒害青年一代，要他们个人奋斗，“成名”“成家”，在“白专”道路上“让青春放出光辉”。无产阶级文化大革命的号角唤起了年轻人，他们勇敢地投身到革命的洪流中，真正放出了革命青春的光辉！
    革命的惊涛骇浪，猛烈地冲刷着剥削阶级腐朽的旧势力，也有力地冲洗着年轻的一代。他们在阶级斗争中锻炼成长，在阶级斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，而这是在课堂里死读书所学不到的。
    青年人是整个社会力量中最积极最有生气的力量，最少保守思想；他们的世界观正在形成的过程中。今天，置身在这样伟大的革命斗争中，怎样抓住这伟大而珍贵的时刻，经风雨，受锻炼，在改造客观世界的同时，改造主观世界，这是每个革命青年都要认真考虑的问题。
    在斗争的风浪里，为什么有些人方向明确，锻炼了革命意志，学会了斗争的本领，进步很快；有些人在革命大路上，却是方向不明，动摇不定，甚至掉了队呢？关键在于自我革命的自觉性。
    多一点革命的自觉性，就会在改造客观世界过程中，抓紧大好时机改造自己的主观世界；多一点盲目性，就会放松大好时机，在这场大革命中一无所得，甚至要犯错误。
      “多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”我们伟大的领袖毛主席，为我们写下这样寓意深长的诗句。在这震撼世界的革命激流中，一朝一夕的变化，往往超过平常的二十年。一个自觉的革命者，必定会以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，不断地在革命斗争的实践中吸取营养，在风雨中勇敢地接受吹打。
    让我们把握住这伟大而珍贵的时刻吧！　火正熊
