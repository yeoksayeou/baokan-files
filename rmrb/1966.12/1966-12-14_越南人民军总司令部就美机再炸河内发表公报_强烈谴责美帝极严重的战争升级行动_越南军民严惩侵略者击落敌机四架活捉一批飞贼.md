The General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army issued a statement on December 13, strongly condemning the extremely serious "escalation" of the war by U.S. aggressor planes that once again savagely bombed the city of Hanoi.

The statement said that on December 13 at 3 p.m., U.S. aggressor planes once again took off to bomb the urban and suburban areas of Hanoi, killing and injuring many civilians and destroying numerous buildings.

The statement said that the military and civilian people of Hanoi, filled with deep hatred for the U.S. aggressors, bravely fought back against the enemy, shooting down four U.S. aggressor planes and capturing a batch of American pilots.

The statement said that the glorious achievements of the military and civilian people of Hanoi serve as a stern warning to U.S. imperialism, exposing its deceitful "peace talks" rhetoric, and at the same time demonstrating the unshakable resolve of the Vietnamese people and their armed forces to defeat the U.S. aggressors.

The statement pointed out that U.S. imperialism, in an attempt to salvage its heavy losses in the war of aggression against Vietnam, will make desperate struggles. However, the more the U.S. aggressors escalate the war, the more humiliating and disastrous failures they will suffer.

The statement called on all military and civilian people of Vietnam to heighten their vigilance and be prepared at all times to foil all the plots of the U.S. aggressors and to achieve more glorious victories.

The statement said that the General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army warmly commends the military and civilian people of Hanoi for their consecutive victories.

The General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army's liaison representative, Major General Ho Van Lau, strongly protested on December 13 against the savage bombing of Hanoi by U.S. aggressor planes.

In a telegram of protest sent to the International Control Commission, he pointed out, "This U.S. air raid on Hanoi is a new and extremely serious 'escalation' in the continuation of the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam." He said that despite suffering heavy defeats in both North and South Vietnam, U.S. imperialism stubbornly intensifies and expands its war of aggression against Vietnam. No matter how the U.S. imperialists escalate the war or use whatever brutal means, they cannot shake the firm resolve of the Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save the country, nor can they save the U.S. aggressors from their doomed failure.

He pointed out that this new crime of the U.S. aggressors further exposes their aggressive and warlike nature, and exposes the fraud of the so-called "peace talks" by the U.S. authorities.

The reporter of this agency reported from Hanoi: The U.S. imperialists continued to escalate the war, sending a large number of planes in the afternoon of December 13 to savagely bomb the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, destroying civilian houses and other buildings in the city and suburbs, and killing and injuring peaceful civilians, committing new heinous crimes.

The heroic Vietnamese People's Air Force and the military and civilian people of Hanoi, filled with great hatred for the U.S. aggressors, fought a very brave battle, severely punishing the aggressors. According to preliminary reports, four enemy planes were shot down, and a batch of American pilots were captured. Of the four enemy planes shot down, two crashed in the southwestern part of the city of Hanoi, one crashed in the southern part of the city, and one crashed in the northwestern part of the city.

Facing the new "escalation" of the war by the U.S. aggressors, the military and civilian people of Hanoi angrily told the reporter that they would heighten their vigilance, be prepared at all times, and fight bravely and tenaciously to give the U.S. aggressors who dare to invade new and heavier blows.

It was reported from here that on December 13, while sending planes to savagely bomb the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, the U.S. aggressors also sent planes to bomb the suburbs of the second-largest city, Haiphong. The military and civilian people of Haiphong, who were on high alert, immediately opened fire to intercept, shooting down one U.S. aggressor plane.
