The members of the Sandstone Gorge Brigade enthusiastically welcomed the delegation from the China-Albania Friendship Association, praising them as a model of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The brigade members held up portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with Chairman Mao's quotations, warmly welcoming the Albanian friends.

	New China News Agency, December 1st: Today, Comrade Pi·Duode, a member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Korça District People's Assembly, visited the "Contemporary Living Yugong"—the Sandstone Gorge Brigade of Yugezhuang Commune, Zunhua County, Hebei Province. He praised, "Here, we see that Mao Zedong Thought has been transformed into a tremendous material force."

	The members of the Sandstone Gorge Brigade had enthusiastically welcomed Comrade Xiehu and the Albanian party and government delegation led by him in April this year. Today, they once again, with deep affection for the Albanian people, braved the bitter cold, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with Chairman Mao's quotations, enthusiastically gathered at the village entrance to welcome the delegation of the China-Albania Friendship Association led by Comrade Pi·Duode.

	When the helicopter carrying the Albanian comrades landed on a flat piece of ground in front of the village, the entire mountain village immediately buzzed with excitement. Amidst the sound of drums and gongs, the welcoming crowd waved the bright red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," repeatedly shouting, "Mao Zedong—Enver!" "Enver—Mao Zedong!"

	The guests, hand in hand with the brigade's party branch secretary Zhang Guishun and the representatives of the brigade members, enthusiastically climbed the hill behind the village to visit the terraces that had been opened up from the rocky mountains. The brigade members, with their bare hands, had turned the rocky mountains into terraces. They carried soil from five miles away, even farther, to fill the terraces. In front of a terrace, Zhang Guishun enthusiastically told the guests, "Half a year ago, when Comrade Xiehu and others visited here, this land was still a virgin field."

	The brigade members, out of gratitude for the great encouragement brought by Comrade Xiehu and others' visit, worked day and night for ten days, covering this virgin field with a thick layer of soil, turning it into fertile land. This year, the millet planted here yielded more than 600 jin per mu. After hearing this, Comrade Pi·Duode praised, "With such hard work, you can create any miracle in the world." In front of a water reservoir carved out of large rocks, 12 meters deep and 17 meters wide, Comrade Pi·Duode also praised, "Although the rocks are hard, with people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they can change its appearance."

	Wherever the Albanian comrades went, the brigade members and the Red Guards who came from outside to visit and learn would burst into enthusiastic applause, repeatedly shouting, "Long live the Albanian Labor Party!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" Comrade Pi·Duode and other Albanian comrades also repeatedly raised their arms and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Red Guards!"

	Comrade Pi·Duode and other Albanian comrades also took off their coats, picked up hoes and shovels, and worked with the brigade members to level the land. The brigade members said, "The Albanian comrades working with us is a great encouragement. We will work harder to produce more and better support the world revolution." During the visit, the Albanian comrades were deeply moved by the revolutionary spirit of the people of Sandstone Gorge, repeatedly praising them as a model of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

	Comrade Liu Xiao, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Comrade He Biao, Vice Chairman of the China-Albania Friendship Association, accompanied the Albanian comrades on their visit today.

	On December 1st, Premier Zhou Enlai received Comrade Pi·Duode, a member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Korça District People's Assembly, and the delegation of the Albania-China Friendship Association led by him.

    阿中友协代表团访问沙石峪大队盛赞“当代活愚公”
    活学活用毛主席著作的好榜样
    社员们举着毛主席画像和毛主席语录牌热情欢迎阿尔巴尼亚朋友
    新华社一日讯　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、科尔察区人民会议执行委员会主席彼·多德同志今天访问“当代活愚公”——河北省遵化县岳各庄公社沙石峪大队时赞扬说：“在这里，我们看到毛泽东思想变成了巨大的物质力量。”
    沙石峪大队的社员们今年四月曾热烈地欢迎过谢胡同志和由他率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团，今天他们又怀着对阿尔巴尼亚人民的深情厚谊，冒着凛冽的寒风，举着毛主席画像和毛主席语录牌，热情洋溢地齐聚在村头，欢迎彼·多德同志率领的阿中友协代表团的光临。
    当阿尔巴尼亚同志乘坐的直升飞机在村前一块平地上降落时，整个山村顿时沸腾起来。在一片锣鼓声中，欢迎人群挥动着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，不断地高呼：“毛泽东—恩维尔！”“恩维尔—毛泽东！”
    客人们同大队党支部书记张贵顺和社员代表手挽着手，兴致勃勃地登上村后的山坡，参观了从石山上开辟出来的梯田。社员们凭着一双手，硬是把一座座石山削成许多梯级，从五里路甚至更远的地方挑来泥土，垫成梯田。在一块梯田前，张贵顺热情地对客人们说，半年多前谢胡等同志站在这块地上参观时，这里还是一块生地。
    社员们为了答谢谢胡等同志来参观给他们带来的巨大鼓舞，怀着真挚的感情，奋战了十昼夜，给这块生地垫上厚厚的一层土，把它变成了良田。今年在这里种的谷子，获得了亩产六百多斤的好收成。彼·多德团长听了以后赞扬说：“你们这样辛勤的劳动，什么人间奇迹都能创造出来。”在一个从大石头中开凿出来的十二米深、十七米宽的蓄水池面前，彼·多德同志还称赞说：“石头虽然很硬，但是有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，就能改变它的面貌。”
    阿尔巴尼亚的同志们走到那里，那里的社员和外地来这里参观学习的红卫兵小将们就发出一片热烈掌声，不断高呼“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”彼·多德团长和其他阿尔巴尼亚同志也连连振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“红卫兵万岁！”
    彼·多德团长和其他阿尔巴尼亚同志还脱下大衣，拿起锄头、铁锨，同社员们一起平整土地。社员们说，阿尔巴尼亚同志同我们一起劳动，这对我们是个很大的鼓舞，我们要更加努力生产，更好地支援世界革命。在参观访问过程中，阿尔巴尼亚同志被沙石峪人艰苦创业的革命英雄主义精神所感动，一再赞扬他们是活学活用毛主席著作的好榜样。
    中共中央委员、外交部副部长刘晓和中阿友协副会长贺彪等，今天陪同阿尔巴尼亚同志一道参观。（附图片）
