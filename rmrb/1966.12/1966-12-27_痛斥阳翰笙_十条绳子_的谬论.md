Editor's Note: Another figure from the "1930s," Yang Hansheng, is also a key member of the Zhou Yang anti-party clique. This capitalist-roader who has infiltrated the party has, for over a decade, usurped leadership positions such as the secretary of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, vigorously promoting Zhou Yang's counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line in the literary and artistic circles, attempting to restore capitalism in China with his masters. Yang Hansheng has consistently engaged in anti-party and anti-socialist criminal activities. Especially during the three years of temporary difficulties, he boldly opposed the party's leadership over literary and artistic work, opposed Chairman Mao's literary line, and desperately maintained and consolidated the old nests of capitalist, feudal, and revisionist literature. He also released anti-party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds such as "North of the Yangtze River," "Li Xiucheng," and "Three People in a Row."

Yang Hansheng is essentially the "organization department head" of Zhou Yang's diehard followers. Following Zhou Yang's instructions, he recruits deserters, gathers demons and monsters, and controls the literary and artistic front. He uses various counter-revolutionary means, combining soft and hard tactics, to try every possible way to disintegrate and corrupt the literary and artistic troops, turning the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and its affiliated associations into tools for promoting Zhou Yang's counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line.

Who controls the leadership of literature and art, and what kind of literary and artistic troops to build, are crucial issues related to whether Chairman Mao's literary line can be implemented and to whom literature and art serve. In this proletarian cultural revolution, we must seize back the leadership of the literary and artistic circles and firmly hold it in the hands of the revolutionary proletarian faction. We must re-educate literary and artistic cadres with the great thought of Mao Zedong, reorganize the literary and artistic troops, and thoroughly overthrow, smash, and expose the capitalist-roaders within the party and all demons and monsters in the literary and artistic circles, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end. To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this.

Denouncing Yang Hansheng's "Ten Strings" Fallacy

In March 1962, under the planning of the old Propaganda Department and the old Ministry of Culture, the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Yang Hansheng and his gang held a conference on the creation of spoken drama, new opera, and children's drama in Guangzhou. At the meeting, Yang Hansheng stripped off his disguise, took off his shirt, and played the shameful role of an anti-party vanguard. He not only boosted the morale of a group of demons and monsters, seeking justice and venting grievances, but also personally took the stage and gave a long and stinking speech, madly attacking the party's leadership.

This speech is Yang Hansheng's comprehensive and systematic anti-party manifesto, a full exposure of his anti-party face.

At this meeting, Yang Hansheng directed his attacks at the party's leadership over literary and artistic work, maliciously slandering that the party had tied the hands and feet of writers with "ten strings." According to him, these "ten strings" resulted in "five musts," namely, "must write about major themes; must write about heroes and pioneers; must participate in collective creation; must complete within a deadline; must obtain leadership approval," leading to "five fears," namely, "dare not write about internal contradictions among the people, especially between leaders and the led; dare not write satires; dare not write tragedies; dare not write about the flaws and failures of heroes; dare not write about the flaws of party members and leaders," making writers "hesitant and difficult to write," resulting in works that are "all the same, all alike." The charges are indeed serious.

Yang Hansheng's constant cries of "ten strings" are nothing new; they are just a rehash of the anti-party attacks by the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, accusing the party of having "five knives" pressing down on writers' heads, and picking up the leftover spittle of the rightist elements attacking the party's leadership!

Yang Hansheng first shouted about breaking the "frames" on the issue of "creation laws," that is, not following the "creation laws," not recognizing "creative talent," denying the "individual labor characteristics" of artistic creation, and "forcing a cow to produce milk."

Yang Hansheng's endless rants about the need for "creative talent," respecting "creation laws" and the "individual labor characteristics" of writers, all boil down to one point: the literary and artistic field is a forbidden garden, artistic creation is a complex mental labor, and writers can only be "respected" and "respected" again, "considered" and "considered" again. They cannot touch their stinking capitalist tricks. Didn't Yang Hansheng once arrogantly declare: "If the party interferes with creation, I will retort, 'You write a play for me to see!'"

Yang Hansheng's calculations are wrong. In our proletarian dictatorship, literature and art are a part of the revolutionary cause. If literary and artistic workers deviate from the track of Mao Zedong Thought and the party's leadership, stand above the masses, the party and the people will overthrow you; if you want to write anti-party and anti-socialist things, garbage, the party and the people will interfere and struggle, this is our firm principle.

Yang Hansheng deeply detests the "three-in-one" creation method of leadership, professionals, and the masses. He distorts "three-in-one" as "three-outs": leadership provides ideas, the masses provide life, and we provide skills. He attacks "three-in-one" as "four-defines": defining the topic, defining the person, defining the time, and defining the quantity, as "conducting large-scale operations," "everyone shouting together, everyone rubbing together." In a word, it's terrible.

"The three-in-one" is the best creation method, a specific implementation of the party's mass line in literary creation. Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "To do well in creation, one must achieve three-in-one." Facts have shown that brilliant revolutionary model operas such as "The Red Detachment of Women," "The Red Lantern," and "Capturing the Tiger Mountain" are all glorious achievements of "three-in-one." Why does Yang Hansheng desperately distort and attack "three-in-one"? It's not hard to understand. By emphasizing the so-called "individual labor characteristics" of artistic creation, rejecting the party's leadership and the masses' criticism and supervision, this small group of demons and monsters can freely write anti-party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds like "Li Xiucheng" and "North of the Yangtze River" to corrupt the masses and conquer hearts.

Yang Hansheng wields his stick and rod, slandering the party's advocacy for describing major socialist themes and the use of reportage to quickly reflect revolutionary reality as "frames," saying that advocating major themes is "relying on themes to decide everything," and that true stories can only be written "when necessary," and writing too many is "going crazy."

Why does Yang Hansheng so fiercely oppose describing true stories and major socialist themes? Looking back at the situation at that time, it's not hard to understand. During the period of temporary difficulties in our country's economy, the Zhou Yang gang thought the time had come, the situation was favorable, and openly raised the banner of bourgeois liberalization. In March 1961, Zhou Yang published a special article on "theme issues" in the "Literary Gazette," throwing out the anti-party and anti-socialist anti-"theme decides everything" theory, loudly calling for "broadening the literary path." Yang Hansheng followed suit, also making a big deal out of the theme issue. Their so-called breaking of "rules and regulations," breaking of "frames" and "rules," is to let those with "ambition" to be anti-party "scholars" fully display their anti-socialist "talents," let all kinds of demons and monsters spread poison without restraint, and prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

Yang Hansheng's so-called "ten strings" are ten poisonous arrows he shot at the party. He arrogantly said, "Let's discuss it, maybe we can summarize ten more." He wants to bring out all the grudges of the demons and monsters against the party, "drumming and attacking." He thought he had the old Propaganda Department and the old Ministry of Culture as his backers, proudly saying that the party's leadership is a "little tyrant," "the foundation is shaken," "can't go on," and wants to "dismiss him." Look, how vicious and arrogant Yang Hansheng's attacks on the party are!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all demons and monsters must be criticized and cannot be allowed to spread freely." Our struggle with Yang Hansheng is a struggle between two classes and two roads. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, defend Chairman Mao's literary line to the death, defend the party's leadership, thoroughly settle accounts with Yang Hansheng's anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes, and thoroughly overthrow, smash, and expose him!

### 痛斥阳翰笙“十条绳子”的谬论

专栏：

    编者按：又一个“三十年代”的人物阳翰笙，也是周扬反党集团的一员大将。这个钻进党内的走资本主义道路的当权派，十多年来，窃踞着全国文联党组书记等领导职务，在文艺界极力推行周扬反革命修正主义文艺黑线，妄图和他的主子们在中国复辟资本主义。阳翰笙一贯进行反党反社会主义的罪恶活动，特别是在三年暂时困难时期，他赤膊上阵，公开反对党对文艺工作的领导，反对毛主席的文艺路线，拚命保持和巩固资本主义、封建主义、修正主义文艺的老窝子，并抛出了《北国江南》《李秀成》《三人行》等反党反社会主义的大毒草。
    阳翰笙实际上是周扬死党的“组织部长”。他禀承周扬的意旨，招降纳叛，搜罗牛鬼蛇神，把持文艺阵地；他运用各种反革命的手段，软硬兼施，千方百计瓦解和腐蚀文艺队伍，使文联及其所属的各个协会成了推行周扬反革命修正主义文艺黑线的工具。
    文艺的领导权掌握在什么人手里，建立一支什么样的文艺队伍，是关系到毛主席文艺路线能否得到贯彻，关系到文艺为谁服务的头等重要的问题。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们一定要把文艺界的领导权夺回来，并且牢固地掌握在无产阶级革命派手里。要用伟大的毛泽东思想重新教育文艺干部，重新组织文艺队伍，把文艺界党内走资本主义道路的当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。
    痛斥阳翰笙“十条绳子”的谬论
    一九六二年三月，在旧中宣部、旧文化部的策划下，反革命修正主义分子阳翰笙等一伙，召开了一个广州话剧、新歌剧、儿童剧创作会议。会上，阳翰笙扯下画皮，赤膊上阵，扮演了反党急先锋的可耻角色。他不仅给一伙牛鬼蛇神壮胆撑腰，伸冤出气，而且亲自出马，作了一个又长又臭的讲话，疯狂攻击党的领导。
    这个讲话，是阳翰笙全面的、系统的反党纲领，是他的反党面目的大暴露。
    在这个会上，阳翰笙把攻击的矛头，集中指向党对文艺工作的领导，恶毒地污蔑党用“十条绳子”捆住了作家的手足。据他说，这“十条绳子”造成了“五个一定”，即所谓“一定要写重大题材；一定要写英雄人物、尖端人物；一定要参加集体创作；一定要限期完成；一定要得到领导批准”，引起了“五个不敢”，即所谓“不敢写人民内部矛盾，特别是领导与被领导的矛盾；不敢写讽刺剧；不敢写悲剧；不敢写英雄人物的缺点、失败；不敢写党员的缺点、领导的缺点”，使得作家“顾虑重、下笔难”，使得作品“千篇一律，千人一面”，罪名可谓不小。
    阳翰笙口口声声叫嚷的“十条绳子”，并不是什么新鲜的货色，不过是胡风反革命分子攻击党有“五把刀子”压在作家头上的翻版，不过是拾资产阶级右派分子攻击党的领导的余唾！
    阳翰笙首先叫嚷要破“创作规律”问题上的几条“框框”，这就是所谓“不按照创作规律办事”，所谓不承认“创作需要才能”，所谓“否认艺术创作个体劳动的特点”，所谓“逼着公牛挤奶”。
    阳翰笙喋喋不休叫嚷的“创作需要才能”呀，要尊重“创作规律”和作家“个体劳动的特点”呀，说来说去，就是一个意思：文艺领域是个禁苑，艺术创作是复杂的精神劳动，对作家只能“尊重”再“尊重”，
  “照顾”再“照顾”，他们那套资产阶级的臭玩意动不得。阳翰笙不是这样狂妄地宣称过吗：党要是过问一下创作，就回敬他说“你给我写个戏来看看！”
    阳翰笙的如意算盘打错了。在我们无产阶级专政的国家，文艺是革命事业的一个组成部分，文艺工作者如果脱离毛泽东思想的轨道，脱离党的领导，高踞在人民群众之上，党和人民就要把你掀倒；如果要写那些反党反社会主义的东西、乌七八糟的东西，党和人民就要干涉，就要斗争，这是我们坚定的原则。
    阳翰笙对领导、专业人员、群众三结合的创作方式深恶痛绝。他歪曲“三结合”是“三出”：领导出思想，群众出生活，我们自己出技巧。他攻击“三结合”是“四定”：定题、定人、定时、定量，是“搞大兵团作战”，“大家一起哄，一起搓”。一句话，糟透了。
      “三结合”是最好的创作方式，是党的群众路线在文艺创作中的具体贯彻。林彪同志指出：“搞好创作，要做到三结合”。事实表明：《沙家浜》、《红灯记》、《智取威虎山》等等光辉夺目的革命样板戏，都是“三结合”的辉煌成果。为什么阳翰笙要竭力歪曲“三结合”，拚命攻击“三结合”呢？不难理解，强调了艺术创作的所谓“个体劳动的特点”，不要党的领导，不要群众的批评监督，他们这一小撮牛鬼蛇神，就可以为所欲为、自由自在地写《李秀成》、《北国江南》之类反党反社会主义的大毒草，以腐蚀群众、征服人心。
    阳翰笙挥棍舞棒，把党提倡描写社会主义重大题材，把党强调运用报告文学这些形式迅速反映革命现实，都污蔑为“框框”，说什么提倡写重大题材就是“依靠题材决定一切”，说什么真人真事只能在“必要时候”写写，多写了就是“发了昏”。
    为什么阳翰笙这样咬牙切齿地反对描写真人真事，反对描写社会主义重大题材呢？回顾一下当时的形势，就不难明白。在我国经济遭到暂时困难时期，周扬一伙认为时机已到，形势有利，公然打出了资产阶级自由化的旗号。一九六一年三月，周扬通过《文艺报》发表的《题材问题》专论，抛出了反党反社会主义的反“题材决定”论，大肆叫嚷要“广开文路”。阳翰笙摇旗呐喊，紧相配合，也在题材问题上大做文章。他们所谓的要破除“清规戒律”，打破“框框”“条条”，就是要让有“志”于反党之“士”充分发挥反社会主义的“才能”，让各种牛鬼蛇神毫无顾忌地放毒，为复辟资本主义作舆论准备。
    阳翰笙的所谓“十条绳子”，是他向党射出的十支毒箭。他狂妄地说“讨论一下，说不定可能再总结十条出来。”他要把牛鬼蛇神对党的怨气统统引出来，“鸣鼓而攻之”。他自以为有旧中宣部、旧文化部作靠山，得意洋洋，胡说党的领导是“小霸王”，“基础动摇了”，“做不下去了”，要“请他别姬了”。看，阳翰笙对党的攻击是何等的恶毒，何等的猖狂！
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”我们同阳翰笙的斗争，是两个阶级、两条道路的斗争。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓死捍卫毛主席的文艺路线，誓死捍卫党的领导，彻底清算阳翰笙反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行，把他彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭！
