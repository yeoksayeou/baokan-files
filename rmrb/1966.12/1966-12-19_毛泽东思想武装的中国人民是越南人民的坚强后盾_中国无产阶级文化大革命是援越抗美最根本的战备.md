A rally of 100,000 people in the capital to denounce U.S. bombing of Hanoi and celebrate the sixth anniversary of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam

The Chinese people, armed with great Mao Zedong Thought, are the steadfast backbone of the Vietnamese people. The fundamental preparation for supporting Vietnam and resisting America is the great proletarian cultural revolution currently underway in China. The rally declared that to oppose imperialism, one must also oppose revisionism, and severely criticized the Soviet revisionist leadership for always acting as the chief accomplice of American imperialism. Zhou Enlai, Tao Zhu, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuquan, Chen Yi, He Long, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, Xie Fuzhi, Guo Moruo, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu, Jiang Qing, and Wu De attended the meeting. Chen Yi, Chen Ziping, Nguyen Minh Hoang, and representatives of the Red Guards, workers, and soldiers spoke at the rally.

According to Xinhua News Agency, on December 18, the 700 million Chinese people, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, have sworn to be the steadfast backbone of the Vietnamese people in their war against American aggression and for national salvation. In the midst of the great proletarian cultural revolution's new victories, 100,000 Red Guards and revolutionary masses from the capital held a grand rally this afternoon to strongly denounce the heinous crime of the American aggressors bombing the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi and to enthusiastically celebrate the sixth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

The rally solemnly declared to the world: The great proletarian cultural revolution currently underway in China is the fundamental preparation for the Chinese people to support the Vietnamese people and oppose American imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression. No matter how turbulent the waves, the Chinese people, who hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, will unshakably stand together with and fight alongside our Vietnamese brothers until we drive the American aggressors completely off Vietnamese soil.

The rally also severely criticized the Soviet modern revisionist leadership for always acting as the chief accomplice of American imperialism and pointed out that to oppose imperialism, one must also oppose revisionism. The modern revisionism centered around the CPSU leadership can only be the target of the international anti-American united front struggle.

Leaders from the central government and various sectors, including Zhou Enlai, Tao Zhu, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuquan, Chen Yi, He Long, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, Xie Fuzhi, Guo Moruo, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu, Jiang Qing, and Wu De, attended the rally.

Heroic representatives of the Vietnamese people: Ambassador Chen Ziping of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Deputy Head of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China, Nguyen Minh Hoang, were invited to attend the rally.

The grand rally was held at the Beijing Workers' Stadium. Red Guards, PLA soldiers, workers, commune members, and cadres from various units, along with dozens of international friends from various countries in Beijing, joined together in righteous indignation. They held high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, countless banners and red flags, forming a mighty procession. Despite the initial snow and cold, they gathered from all directions to protest against the number one enemy of the world's people, American imperialism.

The atmosphere in the venue was filled with a fighting spirit of contempt for all enemies. More than 100,000 Red Guards and revolutionary masses from various sectors held up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," repeatedly reciting the revolutionary truths pointed out by our great leader Chairman Mao: "The oppressed peoples and nations can never entrust their liberation to the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its running dogs, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persevering in struggle." "All the people of the world, unite! Beat back the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! The people of the world must have courage, dare to fight, fear no hardship, and press on. Then the world will surely belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be routed!"

The giant portraits of our most beloved leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh were prominently displayed in the venue. The national flags of the People's Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam fluttered in the wind. A long banner spanning several dozen meters across the center of the venue read: "Firmly support the Vietnamese people's just war of resistance against American aggression and national salvation! Salute to the heroic Vietnamese people!" The people who came to attend the rally repeatedly raised their arms and shouted slogans of supporting Vietnam and resisting America, singing revolutionary songs, and demonstrating the fighting friendship between the proletarian internationalists of China and Vietnam.

The Red Guards, tempered and grown in the great proletarian cultural revolution, were full of vigor and indignation. They held high the Red Guards' banner and distributed a large number of leaflets supporting Vietnam and resisting America in the venue. They said: We are revolutionary rebels and must learn the revolutionary fighting spirit of the Vietnamese people. We are the Little Red Guards armed with Mao Zedong Thought and have made all preparations. As soon as the great commander Chairman Mao gives the order, we will immediately rush to the front line to annihilate the American bandits!

"The American imperialists are sternly warned: Remember the Korean War, your miserable defeat is written there. Look at today's support for Vietnam and resistance against America, your doom is at hand!" The PLA soldiers attending the rally roared with anger. The soldiers also enthusiastically praised the victories of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression, which made the people's war shine brightly, crushed the arrogance of the American imperialists, and boosted the morale of all revolutionary people. They wrote in their protest letter on the spot: "We are the PLA armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, study Chairman Mao's works even more diligently, and are ready to fight alongside the Vietnamese people to defeat the American aggressors at any time."

Workers and commune members who have achieved continuous victories in the revolution and production came to the venue, bringing the strong determination of China's working class and commune members to support the Vietnamese people. They all expressed: The Chinese working class and commune members will resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, fearing no sacrifice, striving for double victories in revolution and production, and are ready to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people until we thoroughly defeat American imperialism!

Around 2 PM, Comrade Zhou Enlai and other leaders, along with Red Guards and representatives from various sectors, ascended the stage with Ambassador Chen Ziping and Deputy Head Nguyen Minh Hoang. At this moment, the entire audience stood up, and the people shouted for a long time: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Ho!" "Salute to the heroic Vietnamese people!" "Salute to the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam!" "The 700 million Chinese people swear to be the steadfast backbone of the Vietnamese people!" "All the people of the world, unite! Overthrow American imperialism!" The slogans echoed like thunder, shaking the heavens.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and President of the Chinese Committee for the Promotion of International Trade, Guo Moruo, presided over the meeting. In his opening remarks (full text on page 3), he said that the people of various sectors in the capital gathered here today to solemnly declare: We fully support the statement of our government on the 15th, firmly support the statement of the Vietnamese government on the 14th, and strongly denounce the crazy American aggressors. We also celebrate the sixth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and congratulate the people of South Vietnam, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, on hoisting the banner of people's war, achieving brilliant victory after victory in the war of resistance against American aggression and for national liberation.

Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, Chen Yi, then spoke (full text on page 3). He, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, expressed the highest respect to the 31 million Vietnamese brothers fighting on the front line of the struggle against American imperialism.

He said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has issued a statement strongly condemning and protesting to the world the new crime of American imperialism's bombing of Hanoi. Chairman Ho Chi Minh once again called on the Vietnamese military and people to be determined to defeat the American aggressors. This call fully expresses the iron will and firm confidence of the entire Vietnamese people in resisting American aggression and saving the nation. The Chinese government and people express the most resolute support for this.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the 700 million Chinese people, extended the warmest congratulations to the organizers, leaders, and inspirers of the South Vietnamese people—the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. He said that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the only true representative and banner of victory for the people of South Vietnam. The heroic fighting and brilliant victories of the military and people of South Vietnam have pointed out the correct path for all oppressed nations and peoples to struggle for independence and liberation.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Chinese people, who hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation. Our position is unshakable. The great proletarian cultural revolution currently underway in China is the fundamental preparation for the Chinese people to support the Vietnamese people and oppose American imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression. Comrade Lin Biao recently pointed out: "We have made all preparations. We are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and resolutely support our Vietnamese brothers to carry the war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation to the end." Our words are true. Vietnamese brothers can believe that the 700 million Chinese people are the steadfast backbone of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear area for the Vietnamese people. In any stormy waves, the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely stand together with and fight alongside the Vietnamese people until we drive the American aggressors completely off Vietnamese soil.

Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic slogans from the audience. People shouted: "Thoroughly smash the conspiracy of 'bombing for peace' by the American imperialists and their accomplices!" "Resolutely expose the traitorous behavior of fake support and real betrayal by the Soviet revisionist leadership!"

Ambassador Chen Ziping said in his speech (full text on page 4) that the heroic Vietnamese people are fearless and know only fighting and victory. The more the American aggressors escalate the war, the more they arouse the hatred of the Vietnamese people and the more determined they are to annihilate the aggressors with five times, ten times the force.

Ambassador Chen Ziping, in his speech, extended warm congratulations to the people of South Vietnam and their only true representative, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

Ambassador Chen Ziping said that the 700 million Chinese people, who hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely carry out Comrade Lin Biao's instructions and are ready to make the greatest national sacrifices to support the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people are proud to have such a sincere friend and close brother, the Chinese people.

Nguyen Minh Hoang said in his speech (full text on page 4) that the entire people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam are extremely indignant at the continuous bombing of Hanoi by American imperialism. He said that the people of South Vietnam are determined to take up arms and resolutely defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys, using revolutionary violence against counter-revolutionary violence and a war of national liberation against a war of aggression.

Nguyen Minh Hoang said that we highly appreciate the immense and precious support given by the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Communist Party of China to the Vietnamese people. We express our deep gratitude to the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Communist Party of China led by the respected Chairman Mao.

Nguyen Minh Hoang said that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the decisive factor and force in determining the development of the situation in South Vietnam and is the organizer and leader of the heroic fighting of the people of South Vietnam. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is performing the functions of a truly democratic and strong state for the people of South Vietnam. It leads the South Vietnamese revolution from victory to victory and will surely achieve complete victory.

The speeches of Ambassador Chen Ziping and Deputy Head Nguyen Minh Hoang were met with repeated rounds of enthusiastic applause. People repeatedly shouted: "Strongly denounce the heinous crime of the American aggressors bombing Hanoi!" "Firmly support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's 'Call to Arms'!" "Long live the fighting unity of the peoples of China and Vietnam!"

Red Guard representative Shen Aiqun, PLA representative and war hero Zhang Jihui, worker representative Cai Lianxing, and peasant representative Tu Yaobing spoke at the rally (full texts on page 5). They strongly condemned the heinous crime of American imperialism's crazy bombing of Hanoi and the Chinese embassy in Vietnam. They said that the Chinese people have made all preparations, and as soon as the Vietnamese people need us and our great leader Chairman Mao gives the order, we will immediately rush to the front line of supporting Vietnam and resisting America, fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people, and bury the common enemy of all peoples, American imperialism, in the ocean of people's war.

The rally, amid thunderous applause, adopted a telegram denouncing the U.S. bombing of Hanoi, a telegram celebrating the sixth anniversary of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and a telegram of condolences to all comrades of our embassy in Vietnam (to be published separately). At the rally, a statement supporting and voicing solidarity with the struggle of the Vietnamese people was also read, issued by 43 Latin American and Spanish individuals working in Beijing (full text on page 5).

Other leaders attending the rally included: Liao Chengzhi, Yang Xiufeng, Liu Zhijian, Zhang Chunqiao, Xie Dingyuan, Wang Li, Guan Feng, Chen Boda, Mu Xin, Yao Wenyuan, Cao Yiyou, Yu Lijin, Li Zuopeng, Zheng Weishan, Fu Chongbi, Zhang Zaihong, Han Nianlong, Li Siguang, and He Deqing.

Williams, American citizen Li Dunbai, representative of the Patriotic Front of Thailand abroad Paron, head of the delegation of the Malayan National Liberation League to China Shalma, head of the office of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Beijing Galub, president of the Lao Women's Union Gui Ning, Sudanese individual Keer, and Indonesian individual Weili.

As the rally concluded, everyone stood up and shouted: "Vietnam will win, American imperialism will be defeated!" "Long live the great unity of the people of the world!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" The fighting spirit of the entire audience reached its peak. At this moment, Premier Zhou Enlai led the 100,000-strong army to sing the "Internationale" in unison. The revolutionary fighting spirit of the people soared, and the song of the united struggle of the proletariat of the world echoed through the clouds. (with photos)

    会场上充满了蔑视一切敌人的战斗气氛。十万多红卫兵小将和各界革命群众，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，一遍又一遍地朗诵我们伟大领袖毛主席指出的革命真理：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，和胡志明主席的巨幅画像，高高悬挂在会场上。中华人民共和国国旗、越南民主共和国国旗和越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，在会场上空迎风招展。长达数十米的标语牌横贯会场中央，上面写着：“坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国正义战争！向英雄的越南人民致敬！”前来参加集会的人们，不断振臂高呼援越抗美的战斗口号，高唱革命歌曲，显示了中越两国人民无产阶级国际主义的战斗友谊。

      “对美帝严正警告：可记得抗美援朝，你们的狼狈写照，看今日援越抗美，你们的末日即到！”参加集会的中国人民解放军指战员们发出了愤怒的吼声。指战员还热烈赞扬越南人民抗美救国战争的胜利，使人民战争大放异彩，灭了美帝的威风，长了一切革命人民的志气。他们在当场写出的抗议书中说：“我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军，我们坚决响应林彪同志的号召，更加努力学习毛主席著作，随时准备和越南人民一起，打败美国侵略者。”
    在抓革命促生产中不断取得胜利的工人和社员们来到会场，带来了我国工人阶级和人民公社社员声援越南人民的强大决心。他们纷纷表示：中国工人阶级和人民公社社员坚决按照毛主席的教导办事，不怕任何牺牲，争取革命和生产的双胜利，准备着同越南人民并肩战斗，直到把美帝国主义彻底打败！
    下午二时许，周恩来同志等领导人和红卫兵以及其他各界代表，同陈子平大使、阮明芳代团长登上主席台。这时，全场起立，人们长时间地高呼：“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”“胡主席万岁！”“向英雄的越南人民致敬！”“向越南南方民族解放阵线致敬！”“七亿中国人民誓作越南人民的坚强后盾！”“全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！”口号声如风雷激荡，震天动地。
    人大常委会副委员长、中国和委会主任郭沫若主持大会。他在开会词（全文见第三版）中说，首都各界人民今天在这里集会，郑重表示：完全拥护我国政府十五日的声明，坚决支持越南民主共和国政府十四日的声明，严正地对疯狂的美国侵略者加以声讨。我们还同时庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立六周年，祝贺越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，高举人民战争的旗帜，在抗美救国争取解放的战争中，取得了一个又一个的辉煌战果。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理陈毅接着讲话（全文见第三版），他代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，向战斗在反对美帝国主义斗争最前线的三千一百万越南兄弟，表示最崇高的敬意。
    他说，越南民主共和国政府已经发表声明，向全世界人民强烈控诉和抗议美帝国主义轰炸河内的新侵略罪行。胡志明主席又一次号召越南军民决心战胜美国侵略强盗。这个号召充分表达了全体越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和坚强信心。中国政府和中国人民对此表示最坚决的支持。

    陈毅副总理说，高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中国人民，坚决支援越南人民抗美救国战争。我们这个立场是坚定不移的。我国正在进行的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，是中国人民支援越南人民、反对美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的最根本的战备。林彪同志不久前曾经指出：“我们已经作好了一切准备。我们决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支持兄弟的越南人民把抗美救国的战争进行到底。”我们说的话是算数的。兄弟的越南人民可以相信，七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，中国的辽阔国土是越南人民的可靠后方。在任何惊涛骇浪中，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，一定同越南人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，一直到把美国侵略者从越南土地上全部赶出去。
    陈毅副总理的讲话一再被全场激昂的口号声所打断。人们高呼：“彻底粉碎美帝及其帮凶‘以炸迫和’的阴谋！”“坚决揭露苏修领导集团的假支持、真出卖的叛徒行为！”
    陈子平大使在讲话（全文见第四版）中说，英雄的越南人民是无所畏惧的，他们知道的只有战斗和胜利。美国强盗越是使战争“升级”，就越激起越南人民的仇恨，更坚决地以五倍、十倍的力量来消灭侵略者。
    陈子平大使在讲话中，向越南南方人民和他们唯一的真正代表越南南方民族解放阵线，表示热烈祝贺。
    陈子平大使说，高举毛泽东思想红旗的七亿中国人民，坚决执行林彪同志的指示，不惜作出最大的民族牺牲来支援越南人民。越南人民为有中国人民这样一个真诚的朋友、亲密的兄弟而感到非常自豪。
    阮明芳在讲话（全文见第四版）中说，越南南方全体人民和越南南方民族解放阵线对美帝国主义连续轰炸河内，感到无比愤怒。他说，越南南方人民决心拿起武器，坚决打败美国侵略者及其走狗，用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，用爱国战争反对侵略战争。
    阮明芳说，我们对中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党给予越南人民无比巨大和珍贵的支持给予很高的评价。我们向中国人民、中国政府和以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党，表示越南南方人民和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会的深切谢意。
    阮明芳说，越南南方民族解放阵线是决定越南南方局势的发展的决定因素和力量，是越南南方人民英勇战斗的组织者和领导者。越南南方民族解放阵线已执行着越南南方人民真正民主和坚强国家的职能。它引导越南南方革命从胜利走向胜利，并必将取得完全胜利。
