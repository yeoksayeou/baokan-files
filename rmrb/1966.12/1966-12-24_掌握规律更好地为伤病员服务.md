Our great leader Chairman Mao in his brilliant work "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War" teaches us: "In doing any work, if one does not understand the situation of the thing, its nature, and its relationship with things outside it, one will not understand the laws governing the thing, will not know how to do the work, and will not be able to do it well." Over the past few years, I have followed Chairman Mao's instructions, continuously summarized practical experience, explored the laws of work, gradually changed from passivity to initiative, reduced blindness, and increased self-awareness.

I became a nurse in 1960, transitioning from a nursing assistant. Studying the "Three Articles" (Quotations from Chairman Mao) made me resolve to serve the people wholeheartedly. However, I only had four years of education, and my professional skills were weak, so I encountered many difficulties at work. The same amount of work that others could complete on time and perfectly, I always had to start early and finish late, busily working all day, yet the quality of my work was still not high. Once, during a night shift, after 8 PM, there was only me and a nursing assistant in the ward. Full of enthusiasm, I wanted to do the work well, running around everywhere, checking every corner of the ward, but I neglected to focus on the three patients receiving intravenous drips. As a result, one patient's temperature suddenly rose to 40 degrees, almost causing a fatal accident. Comrades criticized me, but I did not understand the issue. Later, after studying "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War," I found the answer.

Chairman Mao said: "If one does not understand the characteristics of the Chinese revolutionary war, one cannot direct the Chinese revolutionary war, and cannot lead the Chinese revolutionary war to victory." Reflecting on this incident, wasn't it precisely because I had not grasped the laws of work and the characteristics of the job that this accident occurred? This made me realize that to do a good job as a nurse, one must not only have the mindset of serving the patients "completely" and "thoroughly," but also recognize and master the laws of work.

For a period, our ward mainly admitted minor patients. During the winter measles season, there were many patients, many severe cases, and many requiring emergency treatment, making the workload quite heavy. How could one avoid chaos amidst the busyness? I paid attention to learning from the strengths of other comrades in nursing work and analyzed the characteristics of measles care. For example, measles cause high fever, and patients often do not eat well, leading to insufficient intake, which requires intravenous drips to supplement. This not only increases the patient's pain but also the nurse's workload. Therefore, it is very important to do a good job in life care and ensure the patient's diet. Additionally, measles can lead to laryngitis, and the condition can change rapidly, possibly resulting in suffocation within a few hours. Thus, it is crucial to closely monitor the patient's condition. Summarizing these points, I concluded that measles care must focus on five key areas: intake, warmth, condition, rescue, and intravenous drips. No matter how busy the work is, these five areas cannot be neglected. Later, to quickly familiarize ourselves with the children's living habits and timely grasp the changes in their condition, we changed the nurse shift system to fixed assignments, further improving the quality of measles care.

Mastering the special laws of different diseases is also necessary to understand the different situations of patients. Chairman Mao said: "Different war situations determine different laws of war direction." In nursing work, even within the same disease category, due to different patient conditions, different nursing characteristics are determined. For example, observing the condition, it is relatively easy to do so timely and accurately for a child who is sensible and can speak. However, for infants under one year old who cannot speak, all reactions are expressed through crying. Focusing on this characteristic, over the years, I have paid attention to observing the infant's cries and expressions in clinical practice, gradually understanding some rules, and being able to judge different causes such as pain, hunger, and wet diapers more accurately, and provide timely treatment.

Objective things are constantly changing, and there is nothing that remains unchanged. In this article, Chairman Mao points out: Commanders should continuously progress and develop, not only being able to command in the lower stages of war but also in the higher stages. Nurses are frontline commanders fighting against diseases. How can we progress and develop towards the high standard of serving the people "completely" and "thoroughly"? I think: The service objects of nurses are patients, and all changes are related to the patients' thoughts. Mastering the patients' thought laws and fully mobilizing the patients' initiative to fight against diseases is an important factor in defeating diseases. Therefore, I pay great attention to understanding the patients' thought laws and, based on their thought situations, study Chairman Mao's works with the patients, helping them build confidence in overcoming diseases. For newly admitted patients, there are generally three thought situations: those who are worried about the disease should be encouraged to see the light in times of difficulty and to raise their courage to overcome the disease; those who are indifferent should be told the strategic disdain and tactical emphasis on the disease; those who are impatient should be comforted to accept their situation and focus on recovery. Chairman Mao's words are truly the most powerful and authoritative. Many patients, under the inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, have increased their confidence and actively cooperated with the treatment, fighting against the disease.

Through the study of "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War," I deeply feel that this brilliant work written by Chairman Mao thirty years ago has extremely practical guiding significance for every aspect of our work today. To truly master Mao Zedong Thought, the fundamental issue is to establish a worldview of completely and thoroughly serving the people; with a high standard in mind, one can consciously follow Chairman Mao's teachings, diligently learn in practice, and strive to master the laws of work, making ordinary work greatly beneficial to the people.

### 掌握规律更好地为伤病员服务

    掌握规律更好地为伤病员服务
    护士　张金宁
      我们伟大的领袖毛主席在《中国革命战争的战略问题》这部光辉的著作中教导我们说：“不论做什么事，不懂得那件事的情形，它的性质，它和它以外的事情的关联，就不知道那件事的规律，就不知道如何去做，就不能做好那件事。”几年来，我按照毛主席的指示，不断总结实践经验，摸索工作规律，逐步变被动为主动，减少了盲目性，提高了自觉性。
    我是一九六○年由护理员改做护士工作的。学习“老三篇”，使我下定了要全心全意为人民服务的决心。但是，我只念过四年书，业务技术底子很薄，工作中遇到不少困难。同样的工作量，别的同志能按时圆满地完成任务，我却总是早上班晚下班，一天忙忙碌碌，工作质量还是不高。有一次我值小夜班，晚上八点钟以后，病房只有我和一个护理员。我满腔热情地想把工作做好，东跑西跑，看遍了病房，查遍了病床，却没有重点巡视三个输液的病人，结果有一名输液病人体温突然升到四十度，差一点造成生命危险。同志们批评我，我还不得要领。后来，学习了《中国革命战争的战略问题》，才找到了答案。
    毛主席说：“不了解中国革命战争的特点，就不能指导中国革命战争，就不能引导中国革命战争走上胜利的途径。”我检查这次事故，不正是因为我没有摸清工作规律，掌握工作特点所造成的吗？这使我懂得做好护士工作，不仅要有“完全”“彻底”为病人服务的思想，还必须认识和掌握工作规律。
    有一个时期，我们那里主要收容小病人。冬季麻疹流行季节，病人多，重病人多，要抢救的多，工作量相当大。怎样才能做到忙而不乱呢？我注意学习其他同志护理工作的优点，分析麻疹护理的特点。比如，麻疹引起高烧，病人常吃不好，入量不够，就要靠输液来补充。这样，既增加病人的痛苦，又增加护士的工作量。因而，搞好生活护理，保证病人饮食，就很重要。再如，麻疹并发喉炎，病情变化很快，几小时之内就可能窒息死亡，所以要把好观察病情的关口。综合这些情况，我总结了麻疹护理工作必须把好五关：入量关、保暖关、病情关、抢救关、输液输血关。无论工作再多再忙，这五关不能放松。后来，我们为了尽快熟悉患儿的生活特点，及时掌握病情变化，又将护士轮班制改为固定分工，使麻疹护理工作质量又提高了一步。
    掌握了不同病种的特殊规律，还必须掌握病人的不同情况。毛主席说：“战争情况的不同，决定着不同的战争指导规律”。拿护理工作来说，在同一病种中，又因为病人的情况不同，决定着不同的护理特点。比如观察病情，对懂事会说话的孩子，就比较容易做到及时、准确。而一岁以内的婴儿，不会说话，一切反应都是用哭来表达。针对这个特点，几年来我在临床中就注意观察婴儿的哭声和表情，逐步摸到了一些规律，可以比较准确地判断病痛、饥饿和尿湿等不同原因，及时给予处理。
    客观事物是变化无穷的，一成不变的东西是没有的。毛主席在这篇文章中指出：指挥员应当不断地进步和发展，不仅在战争的低级阶段会指挥，到了高级阶段也要会指挥。护士是向疾病作斗争的基层指挥员，怎样才能向“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的高标准进步和发展呢？我想：护士的服务对象是病人，各种情况变化无不与病人的思想相关联，掌握病人的思想规律，充分调动病人向疾病作斗争的积极性，这是战胜疾病的重要因素。因此，我很注意摸病人的思想规律，针对他们的思想情况，和病人一起学习毛主席著作，使病人增强战胜疾病的信心。新入院的病人，一般有三种思想情况：对疾病有顾虑的，就鼓励他在困难的时候要看到光明，要提高战胜疾病的勇气；“满不在乎”的，就要讲清对疾病应当在战略上藐视，在战术上重视的道理；有急躁情绪的，就安慰他既来之，则安之，使他安心养病。毛主席的话真是威力最大，威信最高。许多病人在毛泽东思想鼓舞下，增强了信心，积极主动地配合治疗，向疾病作斗争。
    通过《中国革命战争的战略问题》的学习，我深深感到，毛主席早在三十年前写的这部光辉著作，对于我们今天的每一项工作都有极为现实的指导意义。要把毛泽东思想真正学到手，根本问题在于树立完全彻底为人民服务的世界观；脑子里有了高标准，就能自觉地按照毛主席的教导，在实践中用心学习，努力掌握工作中的规律，使平凡的工作大有益于人民。
