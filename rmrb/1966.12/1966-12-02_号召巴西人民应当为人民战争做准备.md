The Sixth National Congress of the Brazilian Communist Party, held in June of this year, adopted a political resolution titled "Brazilians Unite to Free Our Country from Crisis, Dictatorship, and the Threat of Neo-Colonialism."

The first part of the resolution analyzes the development of the international situation, pointing out that the struggle between the peoples of the world and American imperialism is intensifying. The resolution states: "Today, a struggle is underway that will soon engulf all of humanity. This is the struggle between American imperialism, which seeks to establish its global hegemony, and the peoples of various countries who demand national liberation, democracy, and socialism."

The resolution points out that American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of humanity. The resolution states that after the defeat of the Nazis and Japanese militarism in 1945, American imperialism formulated and began implementing a plan to dominate vast regions of the globe. This plan has met with fierce resistance. The victory of the Chinese Revolution in 1949 was a devastating blow to these evil schemes. It was the most significant event in world history since the October Revolution, causing a strong resonance among the oppressed nations. The masses in the colonies and dependent countries rose up to fight for their liberation. Especially in Asia and Africa, the national liberation movements have reached a high level. The struggle against imperialism in Latin America has also entered a new stage.

The resolution points out that to implement its mad policy, the Washington rulers are taking new steps to expand the war and undertake other acts of aggression. In this regard, the resolution condemns the U.S. government's policy of so-called "gradual escalation" to expand the war of aggression in Vietnam. The resolution also condemns the Johnson administration's active preparations for war against China. It points out that the main target of American aggression is to isolate and attack China.

The resolution then discusses the expanding struggle of the peoples of various countries against American oppressors. It points out that the struggle of the masses of the people for freedom and independence, against neo-colonialism, is unprecedentedly high, and they are continuously dealing heavy blows to American imperialism.

The resolution states that the highest expression of the struggle of the oppressed nations is the people's war of the people of South Vietnam against the American aggressors and their puppets. The heroic Vietnamese people are at the forefront of the great struggle against the barbaric actions of the American monopolists. Despite the Pentagon mobilizing a massive war machine and the U.S. military using the most barbaric methods of killing and destruction, the glorious South Vietnamese fighters are inflicting one defeat after another on the capitalist world's largest power.

The resolution points out that in the struggle against American imperialism, the peoples of the world have received steadfast support from socialist countries such as China, Albania, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It states: "China is the strongest base of the world revolutionary movement. China bravely accepts the challenge from the White House, is not intimidated by the threats and acts of aggression from the White House, and stands fearlessly on the side of all those who dare to oppose the American monopolists. China's assistance to the brave Vietnamese fighters is an important factor in resisting the aggressors. Due to the revolutionary and internationalist stance of the People's Republic of China, the American imperialists regard it as their main enemy and are concentrating their forces to oppose it. However, with a population of 700 million and a socialist system, with a glorious People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of its tested Communist Party and Mao Zedong, China has prepared to defeat the American bandits. The success of China's atomic bomb test has strengthened national defense and is beneficial to the cause of peace. By attracting a large number of American military forces to its side, China provides immeasurable help to the peoples of various countries who are fighting for liberation."

The resolution then points out the destructive role of the Soviet revisionist leadership's policies in the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world. The resolution states: "The peoples of various countries who are opposing American imperialism cannot expect to receive genuine support and assistance from the Soviet Union."

The resolution points out that the Soviet revisionist leadership has adopted a policy that is detrimental to the interests of the peoples of various countries, which has had a pernicious effect on the entire international situation. The Soviet government implements a policy of cooperation with the United States, attempting to divide the world into spheres of influence for the two countries.

"The Soviet leaders are hostile to the wishes of the peoples of various countries, betray the cause of socialism, and are increasingly losing their reputation. However, the peoples of the Soviet Union, who have done so much for the revolution, will not tolerate the treacherous actions of the revisionists for long."

In analyzing the main contradictions of the contemporary world, the resolution points out: "In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, there are major conflicts that are severely weakening American imperialism and will ultimately lead to its failure. The main contradiction of the contemporary world is the contradiction between imperialism, led by the United States, and the oppressed peoples of the three continents."

The resolution points out that in the great struggle of the peoples of the world today against American imperialism and its lackeys, Asia, Africa, and Latin America are the most intense battlegrounds. These are the most favorable places to defeat the warmongers of the United States. As the oppressed nations rise up, the situation of imperialism will become increasingly difficult, and the day of its final collapse will come sooner. The sharpening of the main contradictions of the contemporary world encourages all anti-imperialist struggles everywhere.

The resolution calls on the peoples of various countries to unite and defeat American imperialism. It states: "The American imperialists will not voluntarily leave the stage of history. They will resist to the end. They must be annihilated on the battlefield. To defeat them, the peoples of all countries must unite and form a world front against American imperialism."

In this regard, the resolution quotes Chairman Mao Zedong's call:

"All the peoples of the world, unite and defeat the American aggressors and all their running dogs! All the peoples of the world, be courageous, dare to fight, do not be afraid of difficulties, and press on bravely. Then, the whole world will surely belong to the people."

The resolution sets out the tasks of the Brazilian Communist Party in the current international situation, the main content of which is: to actively support the Vietnamese people who are bearing the brunt of American aggression; to protest against the Brazilian government's provision of food and medicine to the Saigon puppets; to aid those in Latin America who are taking up arms against the reactionaries and imperialists; to expose the policy of American imperialism's aggression and expansion of the war in Asia, its hypocritical peace plots, and its evil deeds of supporting reactionaries and terrorist rule in various places; to support the People's Republic of China in its efforts to unite the peoples of all countries to defeat the American imperialists' plan to dominate the world; to expose the true content of the so-called U.S.-Soviet cooperation aimed at dividing the world into spheres of influence; to promote the unity of the peoples of Latin America in the struggle against American monopolies; and to strongly oppose the establishment of the so-called Pan-American Peace Corps.

The second part of the resolution analyzes the situation in Brazil under military dictatorship. The resolution states: "The picture presented by the domestic political situation highlights the deepening of all contradictions in Brazilian society. New combinations of political forces have emerged, both in the ruling class and among the various people's forces. Power has passed into the hands of the most reactionary and pro-American elements, who have made major anti-democratic changes in the political and legal superstructure of our country. Dissatisfaction with the anti-people and anti-democratic policies of the dictatorship is growing, and revolutionary ideas are maturing."

The resolution lists a series of reactionary measures taken by the dictatorship in its domestic and foreign policies. It points out that over more than two years, the Castelo Branco government has shown itself to be extremely blatant in its betrayal of the country, obstructing the development of the nation, causing the people to starve, and abolishing democratic freedoms. It has adopted a completely subservient foreign policy to the United States. The resolution points out that with the establishment of the dictatorship in Brazil, American imperialists have accelerated the process of reducing Brazil to a colony again.

The resolution states that the policies of the Castelo Branco government have produced disastrous consequences. It has seriously harmed the interests of the Brazilian people and nation, plunged the national economy into crisis, and made Brazil even more dependent on the United States.

The resolution points out that the people are not passively accepting the dictatorship's policies of national ruin. The dissatisfaction of the masses, which has been evident since the early days of the coup, has now become widespread and open. The government is hated by patriots and democrats.

In this regard, the resolution lists facts stating that in various parts of the country, there have been powerful actions by various social strata that help to expose and isolate the dictatorship. Students have bravely held open demonstrations for freedom. They have marched and clashed with the repression forces more than once. Intellectuals condemn cultural terrorism, protest the persecution of professors and scientists, and demand a free atmosphere. Workers spit on the rulers and oppose attempts to take away their rights. In some parts of the country, peasants resist those who try to drive them off their land with forged deeds and land grabs. Housewives also take to the streets to protest the rise in living costs. Some democratic factions express their disagreement with the status quo and criticize the violence and illegal actions of the dictatorship.

Protests against the government's betrayal of the country are increasing. Anti-American sentiment in Brazil has never been so strong.

The resolution also points out that two years after the April coup, the forces that originally carried out the coup are now in a state of disintegration. Most of them now hold opposing views on the dictatorship, and the dictatorship has even lost the support of a considerable part of the military. The Castelo Branco clique is backed by American imperialism and the most reactionary generals and politicians.

The resolution states that all this indicates that Brazil is heading towards serious political conflicts, social upheavals, and larger-scale struggles. The increasingly acute basic contradictions are irreconcilable and can only be overcome through revolution.

The third part of the resolution discusses the struggle of the Brazilian people for democracy and national independence. The resolution states: "The development of Brazil requires an end to the plunder of American imperialism and the evil of large estates. It also requires replacing the current system with another that is in the national interest."

The resolution states: "Revolution is the only means to solve the deep crisis in our country. Only revolution can give our country a new economic structure, end the hated land monopoly and foreign plunder, give the people freedom, culture, and happiness, end the imbalances between the various regions of our country. Only revolution can prevent Brazil from being used as a tool by American imperialists in their plan to dominate the world. The revolution will produce a truly people's government, a democratic and progressive political system."

The resolution reaffirms the program adopted by the Brazilian Communist Party at its February 1962 congress, which pointed out the path of national democratic land anti-imperialist revolution. The resolution states that Brazilian Communist Party members must take this program as their guide, which is the goal to be achieved in the current first stage of the revolution.

The resolution calls on the Brazilian people to unite and fight to free Brazil from the threat of becoming a colony again, from the serious crisis it faces, and from the extremely reactionary political system imposed by the dictatorship.

The resolution states that the Brazilian Communist Party will do everything in its power to make this united front of patriots a reality. In the current situation in Brazil, the issue of the united front is of paramount importance. In the effort to form a united front, communists should actively engage, especially among the working class and the broad masses of peasants, and always pay attention to the alliance of these two social classes. This will help to ensure the leadership of the proletariat in the revolution.

The resolution calls for a powerful mass movement in Brazil, relying on the patriotic unity of the people, to concentrate forces to strike at the Castelo Branco government, which represents the interests of American imperialists and all the darkest forces within the country. In this regard, it stresses the need to fully mobilize the peasant masses as a great force to achieve national democratic goals. It states that the best place for the Brazilian people to wage their struggle is in the countryside. The peasants, who suffer the deepest oppression and exploitation, are an inexhaustible source of revolutionary vitality. Once they are mobilized and have firm leadership, they will change the course of events and change the political, economic, and social face of Brazil.

Regarding the methods of struggle, the resolution states: on the one hand, political activities and the activities of uniting patriots must be carried out, and on the other hand, preparations must be made for armed struggle, which is the highest form of mass struggle. "The idea of taking up arms to free our country from backwardness and oppression is becoming stronger and more powerful."

The resolution emphasizes: "The revolutionary struggle in our country will take the form of a people's war. This conclusion is based on both international experience and a study of Brazilian reality. At a time when American imperialism is intervening everywhere with force and the reactionary forces are expanding their machinery of violence, only a struggle that includes all the people can be completely successful."

"The Brazilian people must prepare for a people's war. In all places, especially in the countryside, the issue of armed struggle must be discussed, and under the condition of observing the principles of secrecy, practical preparations for armed struggle must be made. The Brazilian people, uniting their forces into a broad united front, waging active political actions, and taking various forms of struggle, will surely be able to achieve victory."

The fourth part of the resolution calls on Marxist-Leninists to continue the struggle, defeat revisionism, and advance the revolution. The resolution states:

"To defeat the mortal enemy of the Brazilian people and lead the Brazilian people to victory, we must not give modern revisionism and all tendencies hostile to Marxism-Leninism any breathing space. The struggle of ideas currently occupies a prominent position in the activities of communists. To struggle against ideas that are incompatible with the interests of the proletariat and to unyieldingly defend the teachings of Marx, Engels, and Lenin is the most important task of the world workers' movement. We must expose, isolate, and overthrow the revisionists. Without achieving this goal, it is impossible to defeat American imperialism and advance the revolution."

The resolution points out that modern revisionists are traitors to the revolution. The resolution states: "The struggle of the peoples of various countries against American imperialism is inseparable from the merciless struggle against modern revisionism. The current in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which has taken control of the party, has spread throughout the world communist movement. Its goal is to make the oppressed nations deviate from the struggle for national liberation, to make the proletariat in capitalist countries deviate from the struggle for socialism, and to make socialist countries regress to capitalism. It represents the influence of the bourgeoisie in the workers' movement and means surrender to imperialism."

The resolution points out that the main ancestor of modern revisionism is Nikita Khrushchev. This traitor, in his reports at the 20th and 22nd Congresses of the CPSU, argued and systematized a whole set of ideas that are fundamentally contrary to proletarian theory.

The resolution states: The policy of the revisionists has not changed with Khrushchev's fall from power. His successors maintain the same erroneous views, and because of their hypocrisy, they are even more dangerous. They lead the CPSU and the Soviet government, talking loudly about opposing American imperialism, but in fact, they are tightening cooperation with the United States. On countless occasions, they have repeatedly stated that "the policy of establishing comprehensive cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States is unchanging." As for the communist movement, they talk about their desire for unity. However, in reality, they are carrying out the most shameless split activities. They repeatedly declare their support for national liberation struggles. However, they do everything possible to suppress armed movements against imperialism that arise all over the world. In Vietnam, they not only do not make effective contributions to helping the Vietnamese people expel the aggressors but also try to save the failure of American imperialism through peace talks that are favorable to the United States. The leaders of the CPSU further sink into the pit of capitalist restoration, introduce the profit system in enterprises, adopt non-socialist factory management methods, and expand the personal property of collective farm members.

The resolution states: "The modern revisionists have caused splits in the world communist movement and have brought splits into the socialist camp. In this situation, the socialist camp, as a whole, can no longer be considered a base for the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. Only a part of this camp, led by the People's Republic of China, plays such a role.

"The CPSU revisionists and their followers around the world are traitors to the revolution and socialism. Objectively, they are allies of American imperialism and obstacles to the struggles of the peoples of various countries."

The resolution points out that in Brazil, the revisionists are also traitors to the revolution. The Brazilian Communist Party led by Prestes abandoned Marxism-Leninism, accepted the opportunist views of the CPSU, and caused great harm to the democratic anti-imperialist struggle.

The resolution points out that Marxism-Leninism is achieving great victories in the struggle against modern revisionism. Modern revisionism is being defeated and is in deep crisis. Resistance to revisionism is gradually growing. The revolutionary movement of Marxism-Leninism is today a rising force. This is unstoppable.

The resolution states: "The great doctrine of the proletariat is becoming stronger in the struggle against opportunist views, in the merciless exposure of the betrayal of the revisionist leaders. In this struggle, Marxism-Leninism is enriched with new theories, clarifies a series of major issues of the contemporary world, and fully demonstrates its revolutionary and transformative nature. In this regard, the Chinese communists have made outstanding contributions."

The resolution emphasizes this truth: Marxists cannot unite with revisionists. It states: "The struggle against revisionism will continue until revisionism is thoroughly defeated. What is opposed are two diametrically opposed, diametrically opposed views: whether to make a revolution, whether to oppose imperialism, and whether to carry the socialist revolution to the end. There is no middle ground, and there is no room for compromise. This is essentially a class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The Marxist-Leninist party and the revisionist party cannot unite."

The resolution states: "Currently, the communist ranks are experiencing a period of split and struggle, during which a new, higher level of unity is being forged. The basis for this unity of the world communist movement already exists. The basis is composed of the communist parties of socialist countries that remain loyal to Marxism-Leninism, the communist parties and workers' parties of the capitalist world that have not been dragged onto the revisionist path, and the parties that have split with the revisionists in some countries. The Brazilian Communist Party is also the basis for the unity of the Brazilian communist movement."

The resolution points out: "Similarly, it is impossible for Marxist-Leninist parties to form a united front with revisionist parties. The world united front of the peoples of various countries is basically aimed at American imperialism. The revisionists, despite their boasting about opposing American monopolists, do not actually fight them. On the contrary, they implement cooperation or compromise."

The resolution also states: "There is no room for a middle position in the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism. Taking a neutral position between the CPSU, which is at the head of revisionism, and the Chinese Communist Party, which is at the forefront of the Marxist-Leninists, is wrong. The principle differences between the two conflicting lines cannot be ignored." The resolution continues: "It is a vacillating, compromising attitude to be unclear about the divisions within the world communist movement. The neutral position is characteristic of those who are seeking the revolutionary path but are still under the influence of bourgeois ideology and are therefore vacillating. In Brazil, they must be helped with patient, fraternal criticism to advance towards the proletarian position. After all, they cannot maintain a neutral position for long: they will either evolve towards Marxist-Leninist views or eventually become obstacles to the revolutionary movement. The experience of the Cuban leaders is very illustrative. In the debate between Marxist-Leninists and modern revisionists, Fidel Castro once tried to take a neutral position, claiming that this could better maintain the unity of the communist movement. This neutral position has failed. Fidel turned to publicly and unreasonably attack the Chinese Communist Party and all Marxist-Leninists in the world. Although he claims to oppose American imperialism, in fact, he has stood on the side of the CPSU and other revisionist parties."

The resolution then discusses the issue of the leadership of the proletariat in the revolution. It criticizes the view put forward by some people that only the national bourgeoisie can lead the revolution. The resolution points out that the national bourgeoisie will play a role of some importance in the struggle against American imperialism and for land reform. It is a component force of the democratic anti-imperialist united front. However, due to the two-faced nature of the bourgeoisie, it is wavering and compromising. It has been proven that if the bourgeoisie leads, it will never lead the revolutionary movement to victory. Only a class like the proletariat can successfully lead the revolution. The proletariat is an implacable enemy of imperialism and the large estate system. Therefore, it has the best conditions to unite with the peasants, form a solid alliance with them, cooperate with the petty bourgeoisie and progressive intellectuals, and win over the national bourgeoisie. The resolution states: "The issue of leadership in the first stage of the revolution is a fundamental issue for the working class. Since the working class is the most advanced force in society and is opposed to any form of exploitation, it will not be limited to bourgeois democratic goals. It aims for socialism. It aims to: once the tasks of democratic and national liberation are completed, move to the socialist stage, and only by seizing the leadership of the movement can this be achieved."

The final part of the resolution reviews the process by which Brazilian Marxist-Leninists broke with revisionism and reorganized the Brazilian Communist Party, as well as the achievements made by the party in developing, defending its organization, and waging revolutionary struggles.

The resolution concludes: "The participants of the Sixth National Congress of the Brazilian Communist Party optimistically see the prospect that lies before the Brazilians. The reactionaries and American imperialism have insoluble contradictions. No matter how ferociously they use violence, they cannot escape final defeat. Revolution is not a distant issue. Sooner or later, the people will take up arms to cast off the foreign yoke and build a truly free homeland. The Brazilian Communist Party will honorably stand at the forefront of the Brazilian people's struggle for national liberation and social liberation."

    巴西共产党第六次全国代表会议通过政治决议
    号召巴西人民应当为人民战争做准备
    马列主义同修正主义的斗争是不能调和的并且也没有中间立场
    据新华社一日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西共产党在今年六月举行的第六次全国代表会议上通过一项题为《巴西人团结起来，把我国从危机、独裁和新殖民主义威胁下解放出来》的政治决议。
      各国人民群众争取自由、独立，反对
  新殖民主义的斗争空前高涨，不断给美帝
  以沉重打击
    决议的第一部分分析了国际形势的发展，指出世界各国人民同美帝国主义之间的斗争正在加剧。决议说：“今天正在进行着一场行将席卷全人类的斗争。这就是企图建立自己的世界霸权的美帝国主义，同要求民族解放、民主和社会主义的各国人民之间的斗争。”
      决议指出，美帝国主义是人类最凶恶的敌人。决议说，在一九四五年纳粹分子和日本军国主义者溃败之后，美帝国主义就制定并着手执行了一项统治地球广大地区的狂妄计划。这项计划遭到坚决的抵抗。一九四九年中国革命的胜利，是对这些罪恶图谋的一个毁灭性打击。它是十月革命之后具有最重大世界历史意义的事件，在各被压迫民族中引起强烈的反响。殖民地世界与附属国的广大群众，纷纷起来争取自己的解放。尤其是在亚洲和非洲，民族解放运动已经发展到高度的水平。拉丁美洲反对帝国主义的斗争也进入一个新的阶段。
    决议指出，为了执行其疯狂的政策，华盛顿的执政者采取新的步骤来扩大战争，并采取另外一些侵略行动。在这方面，决议谴责美国政府执行所谓“逐步升级”的政策来扩大侵略越南的战争。决议还谴责约翰逊政府积极地准备对中国作战。它指出，美国侵略的主要目标，是孤立与进犯中国。
    决议随后谈到各国人民正在扩大的反对美国压迫者的斗争。它指出，各国人民群众争取自由、独立，反对新殖民主义的斗争空前高涨，他们不断给予美帝国主义以沉重的打击。
    决议说，各被压迫民族的斗争的最高表现，就是越南南方人民反对美国侵略者及其走狗的人民战争。英雄的越南人民站在全世界反对美国垄断资本家野蛮行径的伟大斗争的第一线。尽管五角大楼开动了庞大的战争机器，而且美国军队使用了最野蛮的杀人与破坏手段，光荣的越南南方战士们却在使资本主义世界最大的强国遭到一次又一次的失败。
    决议指出，在反对美帝国主义的斗争中，全世界人民得到中国、阿尔巴尼亚、越南民主共和国等社会主义国家的坚定不移的支援。它说：“中国是世界革命运动的最强大的根据地。中国勇敢地接受白宫的挑战，不被白宫的威胁和侵略行动所吓倒。它大无畏地站到一切敢于反对美国垄断资本家的人们一边。中国人民对英勇的越南战士们的援助，是抵抗侵略者的一个重要因素。由于人民中国革命的、国际主义的立场，美帝国主义者把它当作自己的主要敌人，正在集中力量来反对它。但是，拥有七亿人口和社会主义制度，拥有光荣的人民解放军的中国，在它久经考验的共产党和毛泽东的领导下，已经作好了打败美国强盗的准备。中国原子弹试验的成功，加强了国防，有利于和平事业。中国把美国大批军事力量吸引到自己方面来，这样，就给予正在为解放而进行斗争的各国人民以无可估量的帮助。”
    决议接着指出苏联修正主义领导集团推行的政策对世界人民的革命斗争所起的破坏作用。决议说：“同美帝国主义相对抗的各国人民，不可能指望得到苏联真正的支持和援助。”
    决议指出，苏联修正主义领导集团采取了一种违背各国人民利益的方针，这一方针对整个国际局势起了恶劣的影响。苏联政府执行一种同美国合作的政策，企图把世界瓜分为两国的势力范围。
      “苏联领导人同各国人民的愿望为敌，背叛社会主义事业，使苏联日益声誉扫地。但是苏联各族人民，既然过去曾为革命做了这么多的事，他们是不会长期容忍修正主义者的背信弃义行径的。”
    决议在分析当代世界的主要矛盾时指出：“在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，发生着巨大的冲突，严重地削弱着美帝国主义，并最终必定使它走向失败。当代世界的主导矛盾，是以美国为首的帝国主义同三大洲被压迫人民之间的矛盾。”
    决议指出，在全世界各国人民今天同美帝国主义及其走狗进行的巨大斗争当中，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲是最激烈的搏斗的场所。这是打败美国好战分子的最有利的场所。随着各被压迫民族起来造反，帝国主义的处境就会日益困难，它最后垮台的日子就会日益临近。当代世界主要矛盾的尖锐化，鼓励着所有各处反对帝国主义者的斗争。
    决议号召各国人民团结起来，打败美帝国主义。它说：“美帝国主义者不会自动退出历史舞台。他们将会抵抗到底。必须在战场上消灭他们。为了战胜他们，就必须所有国家的人民都团结起来，组成反对美帝国主义的世界阵线。”
    在这方面，决议援用了毛泽东主席的这一号召：
  “全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。”
      决议规定了巴西共产党在当前国际局势下的任务，其主要内容是：积极支援承受美国侵略的重担的越南人民；抗议巴西政府给西贡傀儡们输送粮食和药品；援助拉丁美洲手持武器对反动派和帝国主义进行斗争的人们；揭露美帝国主义在亚洲进行侵略与扩大战争的政策、伪善的和平阴谋以及它在各地扶植反动派与恐怖统治的罪恶行径；支持人民中国努力团结全世界各国人民以便击败美帝国主义的称霸世界的计划；揭露旨在把世界瓜分为势力范围的苏美合作的真正内容；促成拉丁美洲各国人民在反对美国垄断组织的斗争中团结起来；大力反对成立所谓泛美和平部队。
      巴西日益加剧的基本矛盾是不可调和
  的，只能通过革命来解决
    决议的第二部分分析了军事独裁下的巴西的局势。决议说：“国内政治局势所展示的一幅图画，突出表现了巴西社会一切矛盾的深刻化。国内出现了政治力量的新组合，无论在统治阶级方面或是各派人民力量方面都是如此。政权转到了最反动最亲美的分子手中，他们对我国的政治法律上层建筑实行了重大的反民主的改变。对独裁政权的反人民反民主方针的不满情绪在扩大，闹革命的思想正在成熟。”
    决议列举独裁政权在国际、国内政策方面采取的一系列反动措施。它指出，在两年多的时间中，卡斯特卢·布朗库政府表明它自己的特点是极端露骨的卖国，它干着阻挠国家的发展，使人民挨饿，取消民主自由的勾当。它采取了一种完全臣服于美国的对外政策。决议指出，由于在巴西建立了独裁政权，美帝国主义者就加速了重新把巴西沦为殖民地的过程。
    决议说，卡斯特卢·布朗库政府的政策产生了灾难性的后果。它严重地损害了巴西人民和民族的利益，使国民经济陷入危机，并使巴西更加依赖美国。
    决议指出，人民对独裁政权的祸国殃民的政策，并不是保持消极的态度。群众的不满，本来从政变最初几天就显示出来，现在则已经普遍化并且公开化了。政府受到爱国者和民主人士的憎恨。
    在这方面，决议列举了事实说：在全国各地，都发生了各个社会阶层的强有力的行动，这些行动有助于揭露与孤立独裁政权。学生们勇敢地举行了争取自由的公开示威。他们举行游行，不只一次地同镇压部队发生冲突。知识分子谴责文化恐怖主义，抗议对教授和科学家的迫害，要求自由的气氛。工人们唾弃执政者，反对取消他们的权利的企图。在国内若干地方，农民反抗那些企图把他们逐出自己土地的伪造契约、霸占土地的人。家庭主妇也上街反对生活费用高涨。一些民主派别表示自己不同意现状，抨击独裁政权的暴力与非法行为。
    对政府的卖国行径的抗议越来越多。反美情绪在巴西从未这样强烈过。
    决议还指出，四月政变两年之后，原来举行政变的那些力量，现在却处于四分五裂状态。大多数现在对独裁政权持反对态度，独裁政权甚至丧失了相当大部分的军队的支持。卡斯特卢·布朗库集团是以美帝国主义和极端反动的将领与政客为靠山的。
    决议说，这一切都表明，巴西正在走向严重的政治冲突、社会动荡和更大规模的斗争。日益加剧的基本矛盾，是不可调和的，只能通过革命来克服。
      巴西人民应当团结起来，组成广泛的
  统一战线，进行民族民主反帝革命
    决议的第三部分论述了巴西人民争取民主和民族独立的斗争。决议说：“巴西的发展，要求结束美帝国主义的掠夺，结束罪恶的大庄园制度。它也要求以另一些符合民族利益的体制来代替现行的体制。”
    决议说：“革命是解决我国所处的深刻危机的唯一手段。唯有革命才能使我国得到一种新的经济结构，结束可憎的土地垄断制和外国的掠夺，使人民得到自由、文化和幸福，结束我国各地区之间的不平衡。唯有革命才能防止巴西被利用来充当美帝国主义者在执行其称霸世界的计划的工具。革命将产生一个真正的人民政府，一个民主进步的政体。”
    决议重申巴西共产党在它一九六二年二月代表会议上通过的纲领，这项纲领指出了民族民主土地反帝革命的道路。决议说，巴西共产党员必须以这项纲领为指南，这是在目前革命第一阶段中要达到的目标。
    决议号召巴西人民团结起来，为使巴西摆脱重新沦为殖民地的威胁，摆脱它所处的严重危机和摆脱独裁政权所强加的极端反动的政治制度而斗争。
    决议说，巴西共产党将尽一切力量来使得爱国者的这一统一战线具体实现。在巴西当前的局势下，统一战线的问题具有头等的重要性。在努力组成统一战线时，共产党人应该展开积极的活动，尤其是在工人阶级和广大农民群众当中，而且经常要注意结成这两个社会阶级的联盟。这样，就会有助于保证无产阶级在革命中的领导权。
    决议号召在巴西展开一个以人民的爱国团结为依靠的强大群众运动，集中力量来打击代表美帝国主义者及国内一切最黑暗势力的利益的卡斯特卢·布朗库政府。在这方面，它强调指出必须充分注意动员作为一支巨大力量的农民群众，来争取实现民族民主目标。它说，巴西人民展开斗争的条件最好的地方，是在农村。遭受压迫和剥削最为深重的农民是革命活力的一个无穷无尽的泉源。他们一旦发动起来，有了坚定的领导，就会改变事件的方向，改变巴西的政治、经济与社会面貌。
    谈到斗争方式，决议说：一方面必须进行政治活动和组织爱国者大联合的活动，同时又必须对武装斗争即群众斗争的最高形式做准备。“必须拿起武器来把我国从落后与压迫下解放出来，这一思想正在变得越来越强大有力。”
    决议强调说：“我国的革命斗争，将采取人民战争的形式。这一论断，既根据国际经验，也根据对巴西现实的研究。正当美帝国主义到处用武力进行干涉，而反动势力又扩大其暴力机器时，唯有把全体人民都包括在内的斗争，才能彻底成功。”
      “巴西人民应当为人民战争做准备。在所有各地，尤其是在农村，必须讨论武装斗争的问题，并且在遵守保密工作准则的条件下，采取实际准备武装斗争的措施。巴西人民把自己的力量联合成广泛的统一战线，展开积极的政治行动，并采取各种各样的斗争形式，必将能够取得胜利。”
      现代修正主义者是革命的叛徒。马克
  思列宁主义者必须继续开展斗争，打败修
  正主义，以便推动革命前进
    决议的第四部分号召马克思列宁主义者继续展开斗争，打败修正主义，以便推动革命前进。决议说：
  “为了击败巴西人民的死敌并引导巴西人民取得胜利，必须不给现代修正主义及一切敌视马克思列宁主义的倾向以喘息机会。思想斗争目前在共产党人的活动中占据着突出的位置。对与无产阶级利益格格不入的思想进行斗争，并不屈不挠地保卫马克思、恩格斯和列宁的学说，是世界工人运动最重要的任务。必须揭露、孤立和斗倒修正主义者。不达到这个目的，就不可能战胜美帝国主义并把革命推向前进。”
    决议指出，现代修正主义者是革命的叛徒。决议说：“各国人民同美帝国主义的斗争，是同对现代修正主义的无情斗争分不开的。在苏联共产党内占了统治地位的这种违反马克思列宁主义的逆流，曾在世界共产主义运动内泛滥。它的目的在于使被压迫民族脱离争取民族解放的斗争，使资本主义国家的无产阶级脱离争取社会主义的斗争，并使社会主义国家倒退到资本主义。它代表了资产阶级在工人运动中的影响，意味着对帝国主义的投降。”
    决议指出，现代修正主义的主要鼻祖是尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫。这个叛徒在他在苏共二十大和二十二大的报告中，把一整套根本违反无产阶级理论的思想加以论证与系统化。
    决议说：修正主义者的方针并没有因赫鲁晓夫的下台而改变。他的后继者维护同样的错误主张，而且由于他们的假仁假义，他们就更加危险。他们领导着苏共和苏联政府，口头大谈什么反对美帝国主义，但实际上他们的所作所为是加紧同美国合作。在无数场合，他们再三说“苏联同美国建立全面合作的政策是不变的”。至于共产主义运动，他们大谈其团结的愿望。但是，在实际上，他们进行着最厚颜无耻的分裂活动。他们三番五次地宣称自己支持民族解放斗争。但是他们又千方百计地窒息地球上各地出现的反对帝国主义的武装运动。在越南，他们不但不对帮助越南人民驱逐侵略者作出有效的贡献，反而企图通过有利于美国的和谈来拯救美帝国主义者的失败。苏共领导人进一步陷入复辟资本主义的泥坑中，在企业中推广了利润制，采取了非社会主义的工厂管理方法，扩大了集体农庄庄员的个人财产。
    决议说：“现代修正主义者挑起世界共产主义运动的分裂，也把分裂带到了社会主义阵营。在这种情况下，社会主义阵营就整个来说，已经不能算作是各国人民革命斗争的根据地了。这个阵营只有以人民中国为首的一部分，起着这样的作用。
    “这样，苏共修正主义者及其在全世界的追随者，都是革命和社会主义的叛徒。客观上他们是美帝国主义者的盟友，是各国人民斗争的障碍。”
    决议指出，在巴西，修正主义者也是革命的叛徒。普列斯特斯领导的巴西的共产党抛弃了马克思列宁主义，接受了苏共的机会主义论点，给民主反帝斗争造成了巨大的损害。
    决议指出，马克思列宁主义在反对现代修正主义的斗争中正在取得重大的胜利。现代修正主义正在被击败，已陷于深刻的危机之中。对修正主义的反抗，在逐步地增长。马克思列宁主义的革命运动，今天是一支蓬勃上升的力量。这是谁也阻挡不了的。
      决议说：“无产阶级的伟大学说，在对机会主义论点作斗争、对修正主义领导人的背叛行为进行无情揭露的过程中日益变得强有力。在这个斗争中，马克思列宁主义为新的论点所丰富，阐明了当代的一系列重大问题，充分表现了自己革命的、变革的本质。在这方面，中国共产党人作出了显著的贡献。”
      决议强调指出这一真理：马克思主义者同修正主义者是不可能团结的。它说：“反对修正主义的斗争，将继续进行到彻底打败修正主义为止。相对抗的是两个截然相反的、针锋相对的观点：要不要干革命，要不要反对帝国主义，要不要把社会主义革命进行到底。没有中间道路，也没有调和余地。这在实质上是无产阶级与资产阶级之间的阶级斗争。马克思列宁主义的党同修正主义的党是不可能联合的。”
    决议说：“目前，共产主义队伍正经历着一个分裂与斗争的时期，在这个时期，正在缔造着水平更高的新的统一。世界共产主义运动这一统一，其基础已经存在。组成这一基础的，是那些对马克思列宁主义保持忠诚的社会主义国家的共产党，那些没有让人家拖上修正主义道路的资本主义世界共产党与工人党，以及那些在若干国家同修正主义者分裂而出现的党。巴西共产党也就是巴西共产主义运动统一的基础。”
      决议指出：“同样地，马克思列宁主义党同修正主义党之间搞统一战线，也是办不到的。各国人民的世界统一战线，矛头基本上是针对美帝国主义。修正主义者尽管夸夸其谈地声称反对美国的垄断资本家，但实际上并不对他们进行斗争。相反地，他们实行合作或妥协。”
    决议还说：“马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义之间的斗争，无中间立场的余地。在作为修正主义之首的苏共和站在马克思列宁主义者前列的中国共产党之间，采取不偏不倚的立场，是错误的。对两条彼此冲突的路线之间的原则分歧，不能置之不理。”决议接着说：“对世界共产主义运动内部的分歧不明确表态，是一种不坚定的、妥协的做法。不偏不倚的立场，是那些寻找革命道路但又仍然处在资产阶级思想的影响下因而动摇不定的人们所特有的。在巴西，必须以耐心的、兄弟般的批评来帮助他们，使他们朝着无产阶级的立场前进。更何况他们不可能长时间保持不偏不倚的立场：他们要么就是朝着马克思列宁主义的观点演变，要么就终于成为革命运动的绊脚石。古巴领导人的经历，是十分能说明问题的。在马克思列宁主义者和现代修正主义者的论战当中，菲德尔·卡斯特罗曾有某段时期企图不明确表态，借口是这样做可以更好地维护共产主义运动的团结。这一不偏不倚的做法破产了。菲德尔转而公开无理地攻击中国共产党和全世界的马克思列宁主义者。虽然他宣称要反对美帝国主义，但实际上他已站到了苏共和其他修正主义党的一边。”
    决议随后谈到关于无产阶级在革命中的领导权问题。它批判了某些人提出的所谓唯有民族资产阶级才能领导革命的说法。决议指出，民族资产阶级在反对美帝国主义、争取土地改革的斗争中，是会起一种具有某种重要性的作用的。它是民主反帝统一战线的一支组成力量。但是，由于资产阶级的两面性，它在动摇妥协。事实证明，如果由资产阶级来领导，它是永远不会把革命运动引向胜利的。唯有像无产阶级这样的阶级，才能胜利地引导革命。无产阶级是帝国主义和大庄园制的势不两立的敌人。因此，它具备了最良好的条件来联合农民，同农民结成牢固的联盟，同小资产阶级及进步知识分子合作，并争取民族资产阶级。决议说：“革命第一阶段当中的领导权问题，对工人阶级来说是个根本问题。工人阶级既然是社会上最先进的力量，是反对任何类型的剥削的，那么，它就不会局限于资产阶级民主目的。它希望的是社会主义。它所着眼的是：民主的、民族解放的任务一旦完成，就转到社会主义阶段，而唯有争取到运动的领导权，才能达到这一点。”
      巴西共产党在巴西人民争取民族解放
  和社会解放的斗争中，站在先锋队的地位
    决议的最后一部分追述了巴西的马克思列宁主义者同修正主义决裂、重新组织巴西共产党的经过，以及党在发展、保卫自己的组织和展开革命斗争中所取得的成就。
    决议最后说：“巴西共产党第六次全国代表会议的参加者，乐观地看到了展示在巴西人面前的前景。反动派和美帝国主义有着无法解决的矛盾。不管他们怎样穷凶极恶地使用暴力，他们都无法逃脱最后的失败。革命不是一个遥远的问题。迟早人民会拿起武器来摆脱外国的枷锁，建设一个真正自由的祖国。巴西共产党在巴西人民的民族解放和社会解放的斗争中，将光荣地站在它的先锋队的地位。”
