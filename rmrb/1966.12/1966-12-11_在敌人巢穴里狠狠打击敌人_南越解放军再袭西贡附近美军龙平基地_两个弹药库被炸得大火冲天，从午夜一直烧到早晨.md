The South Vietnamese Liberation Army once again launched a fierce attack on the U.S. military base at Long Binh near Saigon in the early hours of December 10. This is the third time the South Vietnamese armed forces have struck this U.S. base, following attacks on October 28 and November 17.

According to Western news agencies, the liberation forces targeted four ammunition depots in the base. Two of them suffered massive explosions, triggering a series of chain reactions. The two depots were engulfed in flames that raged from shortly after midnight until 4 a.m. Agence France-Presse reported that there were U.S. casualties in this attack.

Just a few hours earlier (at 10:40 p.m. on December 9), a railway bridge about three kilometers north of Saigon was also rocked by a massive explosion and subsequent fire. The blast shattered the windows of buildings in Saigon.
