The Soviet revisionist leadership and the Indian reactionary government signed an "economic and technological cooperation" agreement in New Delhi on the 10th. According to this agreement, the Soviet government will help the Indian reactionaries build a series of heavy industrial enterprises to strengthen the military power of the Indian reactionaries in their oppression of neighboring countries and realization of their expansionist ambitions. The Soviet government is providing the Indian government with a loan of 300 million rubles to construct and expand these projects. These 300 million rubles are part of the 970 million rubles in "aid" that the Soviet revisionist leadership recently agreed to provide to the Indian government during the Indian government's fourth five-year plan (1966-1970).

    据新华社十一日讯　新德里消息：苏联修正主义领导集团和印度反动政府十日在新德里签订了一项所谓“经济和技术合作”协定。苏联政府根据这项协定，将帮助印度反动派建设一系列重工业企业，以便加强印度反动派欺压邻国、实现扩张主义野心的军事力量。苏联政府给予印度政府三亿卢布的贷款来修建和扩建这些工程。这三亿卢布是苏联修正主义领导集团最近答应在印度政府的第四个五年计划（一九六六——一九七○年）期间，给予印度政府的九亿七千万卢布的“援助”的一部分。
