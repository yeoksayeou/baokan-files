The counter-revolutionary revisionist Yang Hansheng is a close ally of Zhou Yang. He has vigorously promoted Zhou Yang's counter-revolutionary organizational line of surrender and betrayal, and factionalism in the literary and artistic circles, turning the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and various associations into tools for implementing Zhou Yang's counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line.

Yang Hansheng, under the guise of conducting united front work through "social methods" and "broadly uniting writers and artists," has placed his cronies and ghosts and demons in key positions, making the Federation of Literary and Art Circles a chaotic mess. Yang Hansheng once drew up a list of 250 people for "united front" work, actually including traitors and collaborators as "united front" targets. He blatantly arranged jobs for these ghosts and demons, published their "articles," and published their "works" to elevate their social status. In 1957, Yang Hansheng fanned the flames throughout the literary and artistic circles, organizing a group of ghosts and demons to attack the Party. In 1958 and 1959, Yang Hansheng conducted "visits" and "consolation" work everywhere, telling those rightists and reactionary "authorities" who had been criticized to keep calm, use the opportunity, reorganize, and launch a new attack on the Party. When the Third National Congress of Literature and Art was held in 1960, this old hand at counter-revolutionary activities thought the time had come and became even more arrogant in his anti-Party stance. Following Zhou Yang's instructions, he had all the members of the Second National Committee of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles participate in the Third National Committee, resulting in some rightists also participating. Moreover, he openly proposed to specially conduct "united front" work for those "people the sun cannot shine upon," suddenly increasing the number of national committee members to 224, using the opportunity to expand their counter-revolutionary forces. In the leadership bodies of various associations, such as the presidium, committee, board of directors, and secretariat, as well as in various literary and artistic leadership departments, a large number of figures from the 1930s and Zhou Yang's close associates and disciples were added, forming the core leadership for their counter-revolutionary restoration.

However, a large number of worker, peasant, and soldier authors, such as worker poets, soldier painters, and emancipated serf singers, were excluded by Yang Hansheng and his gang. They attacked worker, peasant, and soldier authors for having "little social influence," being "young," and "lacking representativeness," but praised Hu Shi's writers, anti-communist literati, and butterfly school writers as having "social influence" and "representativeness" despite being "right-wing in politics." This was an open endorsement of ghosts and demons.

In some departments of the literary and artistic circles, Yang Hansheng also used his authority to place a batch of relatives and friends, including traitors, historical counter-revolutionaries, spies, landlords, rich peasants, capitalists, rightists, and hooligans.

The counter-revolutionary organizational line that Yang Hansheng promoted is a preparation in terms of manpower and public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. We must not let their plots succeed.

    周扬死党的“组织部长”
    反革命修正主义分子阳翰笙，是周扬的死党。他在文艺界极力推行周扬的招降纳叛、结党营私的反革命组织路线，使文联和各协会成了推行周扬反革命修正主义文艺路线的工具。
    阳翰笙打起通过“社会方式”搞统战工作、“广泛团结作家艺术家”的幌子，安插亲信和牛鬼蛇神，把文联搞得乌烟瘴气。阳翰笙曾经策划了一个二百五十人的“统战”名单，竟把汉奸、叛徒列为“统战”对象，明目张胆地为这些牛鬼蛇神安排工作，发表“文章”，出版“作品”，提高他们的社会地位。一九五七年，阳翰笙在文艺界到处煽风点火，组织一些牛鬼蛇神向党进攻。一九五八、一九五九年，阳翰笙又到处进行“访问”、
  “安慰”工作，要那些受到批判的右派分子和反动“权威”沉住气，利用时机，重整旗鼓，向党发动新的进攻。一九六○年第三次文代会召开时，这个反党老手认为时机已到，反党气焰更加嚣张。他禀承周扬的意旨，让第二届的文联全国委员全部参加第三届全国委员会，结果一些右派分子都参加了。不仅如此，他公然提出要特别“统战”那些“阳光照不到”的人，突然把全国委员的名额增加到二百二十四人，借机扩大他们的反革命势力。在各协会的主席团、委员会、理事会、书记处等领导机构，以及在各文艺领导部门，大量增加了三十年代人物和周扬的亲信、门徒，组成了他们搞反革命复辟的领导核心。
    但是，大批工农兵作者，如工人诗歌作者，战士画家，翻身农奴歌手，却被阳翰笙一伙排斥在外。他们攻击工农兵作者“社会影响小”，“年轻”，“没有代表性”，却把那些胡适派作家、反共文人、鸳鸯蝴蝶派作家说成：“别看政治上右，但有社会影响，有代表性”。这是公开的为牛鬼蛇神撑腰。
    在文艺界的一些部门，阳翰笙还利用职权安插了一批亲属和朋友，其中有叛徒、历史反革命分子、特务、地主、富农、资本家、右派分子、流氓。
    阳翰笙推行的一套反革命的组织路线是在人力和舆论方面为资本主义复辟作准备。我们决不能让他们的阴谋得逞。
