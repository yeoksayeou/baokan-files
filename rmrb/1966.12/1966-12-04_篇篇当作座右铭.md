Every article as a personal motto. Chairman Mao calls us to keep his words in our hearts, to take the lead in curing the Hai River, to study and apply the "Old Three Articles" actively. The more difficulties we face, the more we dare to charge ahead! The higher the dikes, the more we dare to rush forward! Rush! Rush! Rush! Push the carts up the dikes like a gust of wind, stand on the dikes and look towards Beijing: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will forever follow you in revolution, tempered by storms and waves to have a red heart!"

    篇篇当作座右铭
    傅新友毛主席号召记心中，根治海河打先锋，活学活用“老三篇”，篇篇当作座右铭。困难越大俺越敢闯，河堤越高俺越敢冲！冲！冲！冲！推车上堤一阵风，站在堤顶望北京：“毛主席啊，毛主席！俺永远跟您干革命，大风大浪炼红心！”
