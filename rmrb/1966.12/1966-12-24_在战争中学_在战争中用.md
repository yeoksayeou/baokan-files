Soldiers of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, who stand at the forefront of the struggle against American imperialism, place great importance on studying Chairman Mao's military thought. They apply Mao's strategic and tactical principles of people's war to fight against the American aggressors and their lackeys.

Many people are particularly familiar with Chairman Mao's essay "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War." They have memorized the sixteen-character formula for guerrilla warfare proposed in this essay and use it effectively in combat.

A cultural troupe of the Liberation Army even performed a program based on the sixteen-character formula for the liberation zone's military and civilians, helping them better understand and master this treasure for defeating the enemy.

A South Vietnamese Liberation Army soldier visiting China pointed to a quote from Mao's essay displayed in the Chinese People's Revolutionary Museum: "Our strategy is to 'substitute one for ten,' and our tactics are to 'substitute ten for one.' This is one of the fundamental principles for defeating the enemy."

He said, "Once, the enemy launched an attack with several times our number of troops. We defeated the enemy using Chairman Mao's strategic principles."

Another hero from South Vietnam, known for his "tiger-hunting" exploits, visited the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum and shared his insights on Chairman Mao's military thought: "Comrade Mao Zedong's strategic and tactical principles of people's war have been fully applied in our country. As early as 1944, we studied Chairman Mao's sixteen-character formula for guerrilla warfare: 'The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue.' We not only used it in the past, but we use it now; not only in rural areas, but also in cities; against the enemy's small strongholds, and against the enemy's large airfields."

He concluded with confidence, "Following Chairman Mao's teachings, using our strengths to attack the enemy's weaknesses, fighting battle by battle, and biting off piece by piece, we will surely ultimately defeat the American aggressors."

    在战争中学  在战争中用
    站在反美斗争最前线的越南南方解放军战士，十分重视学习毛主席的军事思想，并运用毛主席关于人民战争的战略战术，来同美国侵略者及其走狗进行战斗。
    许多人对于毛主席的《中国革命战争的战略问题》一文特别熟悉，把毛主席在这篇文章中提出的关于游击战的十六字诀背得很熟，而且在战斗中用得很好。
    有一个解放军的文工团还把十六字诀编成节目，为解放区军民演出，以便使他们更好地领会和掌握这个战胜敌人的法宝。
    有一位到中国来访问的南越解放军战士，在参观中国人民革命博物馆的时候，看到陈列室中张贴有一段毛主席《中国革命战争的战略问题》一文中的语录：“我们的战略是‘以一当十’，我们的战术是‘以十当一’，这是我们制胜敌人的根本法则之一。”
    他指着这段语录说：“有一次敌人用了几倍于我的兵力发动进攻，我们就是用毛主席的战略原则战胜了敌人。”
    另一位越南南方的打“虎”英雄，在我国参观中国人民革命军事博物馆时，畅谈他对毛主席军事思想的体会说：“毛泽东同志创造的人民战争的战略战术，在我们那里得到了充分的运用。我们在一九四四年就学习了毛主席的‘敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追’的游击战十六字诀。不仅过去用，现在也用；不仅在农村用，在城市也用；打敌人的小据点用，干敌人大的飞机场也用。”
    他最后还满怀信心地表示，按照毛主席的教导，以我之长，攻敌之短，一仗一仗地打，一口一口地吃，就一定能最后彻底吃掉美国侵略者。
