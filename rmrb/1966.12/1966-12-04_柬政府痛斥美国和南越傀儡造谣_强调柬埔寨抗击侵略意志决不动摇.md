	Cambodian Government Denounces U.S. and South Vietnamese Puppets for Spreading Rumors
	Emphasizes Cambodia's Resolve to Resist Aggression Unshakable

	BEIJING, Dec. 4 (Xinhua) - The Cambodian News Agency on Dec. 2 released a statement from the Royal Government of Cambodia, protesting against the defamatory remarks made by the foreign minister of the South Vietnamese puppet regime.

	The statement pointed out that Chen Van Thieu, the foreign minister of the Saigon puppet regime, recently accused the Cambodian armed forces of invading the border of South Vietnam and shamelessly issued an "ultimatum" to Cambodia. He also threatened to order the South Vietnamese puppet army to cross the common border to pursue the so-called Cambodian troops infiltrating into South Vietnamese territory and the so-called Viet Cong troops using Cambodia as a "sanctuary."

	The statement said that the Royal Government strongly protests against these most absurd accusations. The Royal Government emphasized that it is precisely the South Vietnamese puppet army that has recently committed serious acts of aggression against Cambodia, especially the shelling of the Cambodian outpost at Peam Mong in the province of Prey Veng on Nov. 22, which resulted in the deaths of five people and the injury of five others.

	The statement concluded by saying that Chen Van Thieu's threatening remarks are doomed to failure and will not cause Cambodia to deviate from its policy of non-alignment, nor will they weaken Cambodia's resolve to resist aggression.

	According to Xinhua, the Cambodian News Agency on Dec. 2 also released a statement from the Cambodian Ministry of Information refuting the fabricated rumors by the U.S. authorities in South Vietnam, which aimed to undermine Cambodia's reputation for neutrality. The rumor claimed that U.S. forces captured two injured Cambodians in a battle in the province of Xuan Loc, South Vietnam, on Nov. 19.

	The statement from the Cambodian Ministry of Information emphasized that this rumor indicates that the U.S. and South Vietnamese puppet forces intend to increase pressure on Cambodia's eastern border and provoke new incidents. The statement said that they will be held fully responsible for these incidents.

    柬政府痛斥美国和南越傀儡造谣
    强调柬埔寨抗击侵略意志决不动摇
    新华社金边二日电  柬埔寨新闻社二日发表了柬埔寨王国政府的一项公报，抗议南越傀儡政权外交部长对柬埔寨的造谣诬蔑。
    公报指出，西贡傀儡政权外交部长陈文杜，最近诬蔑柬埔寨武装部队侵犯南越边境，并无耻地向柬埔寨提出“最后警告”。他还威胁要在必要时命令南越伪军越过共同边界，追逐所谓渗入南越领土的柬埔寨部队以及所谓利用柬埔寨作为“庇护所”的越南共产党军队。
    公报说，王国政府对这种最荒谬的诬蔑提出最强烈的抗议。王国政府强调指出，恰恰是南越伪军近来又对柬埔寨犯下了极为严重的侵略罪行，特别是十一月二十二日对波萝勉省佩昂蒙特亚地方的柬埔寨哨所进行轰击，打死五人，打伤五人。
    公报最后指出，陈文杜的威胁性的言论是注定要失败的，它决不能使柬埔寨背离自己的不结盟政策，也决不能削弱柬埔寨坚决抗击侵略的意志。
    据新华社金边二日电柬埔寨新闻社二日发表柬埔寨新闻部的一项声明，驳斥在南越的美国当局捏造谣言，企图破坏柬埔寨中立的信誉。这个谣言硬说美国军队十一月十九日在南越西宁省的一次战役中，俘获了两名受伤的柬埔寨人。
    柬埔寨新闻部的声明强调指出，这一谣言预示着美伪军要加强对我国东部边境的压力，挑起新的事件。声明说，他们要对这些事件负完全责任。
