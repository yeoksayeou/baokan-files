The Overseas Chinese Federation in Vietnam issued a statement on December 14 strongly condemning the U.S. imperialist warplanes' repeated bombing of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the brutal massacre of the Vietnamese people and overseas Chinese.

The statement calls on all overseas Chinese to respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call, to unite closely, to endure hardships, to fear no sacrifice, and to fight alongside the Vietnamese people in the anti-American, national salvation struggle to the very end, until complete victory is achieved.

The statement says that recently, U.S. imperialism has repeatedly dispatched large numbers of aircraft to bomb and massacre innocent residents of the capital, Hanoi. This is a new heinous crime committed by the U.S. imperialists against the Vietnamese people and overseas Chinese. It shows that the U.S. war maniacs have taken a very serious step in their adventurous path of escalating the war.

The statement says that blood debts must be repaid in blood. The deep-seated grudge of the U.S. imperialists' massacre of overseas Chinese and the Vietnamese people, we are determined to avenge.

The statement says that the overseas Chinese in Vietnam and the Vietnamese people share the same hardships and fate. Facing the serious situation of the U.S. imperialists' crazy expansion of the war of aggression, we must further carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of unity and struggle between the overseas Chinese and the Vietnamese people. We must actively respond to Chairman Ho's call, unite as one, fear no hardships, fear no sacrifices, and ensure that in any dangerous situation, we will fight alongside the Vietnamese people in the anti-American, national salvation struggle to the very end, until we achieve a thorough victory.
