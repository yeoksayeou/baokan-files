The following stories of "PLA Accompanying Red Guards" are very touching.

During the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, many cadres and soldiers of the PLA participated in the work of receiving revolutionary teachers and students from other provinces in the capital. In the days they spent with the revolutionary little generals, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings, caring for and loving the Red Guards in every possible way, embodying the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly and the glorious tradition of the PLA. Their actions deeply moved the revolutionary little generals and deeply educated them.

To Let Me See Chairman Mao

I am a Red Guard from Jilin. My left leg is disabled due to illness, so I have to use my left hand to support my left knee when walking, making it slow and laborious.

The happy moment of Chairman Mao inspecting us Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students has arrived. This is a day we have longed for so much! Other classmates are jumping and skipping with joy, but I am sitting to the side, worried. The PLA platoon leader, Qian Zhaoyou, who is in charge of leading us, saw my concern at a glance. He smiled and walked over, patting my head and saying, "Don't worry, you will definitely see Chairman Mao!"

The team set off, and I followed behind, but after walking a short distance, I fell far behind. I was both anxious and tired, sweating all over. Just then, Qian Zhaoyou rushed over, without saying a word, he picked me up and ran forward. I lay on his back, feeling more and more uncomfortable: how could a young man in his late teens let someone carry him? I struggled to get down, but no matter what I said, he refused, tightly holding my legs and running forward.

At that moment, I was deeply moved, thinking: if it were in the old society, someone like me would not only not be able to come to Beijing, but even if I came to Beijing, who would look up to me! But today, Chairman Mao treats us as guests, inviting us to Beijing, and even sending the PLA to receive us, which is something I could only dream of! Thinking of this, tears of gratitude fell like broken pearls. Qian Zhaoyou heard me crying and softly comforted me, saying, "Don't feel bad, we are class brothers, your difficulties are my difficulties, as long as you can see Chairman Mao, no matter how tired I am, I am happy." These words full of class love touched my heart, and tears of gratitude dropped one by one on his cotton jacket.

Qian Zhaoyou carried me for more than ten miles, allowing me to arrive at the designated place on time. He placed me at the front, allowing me to see our beloved leader, Chairman Mao, the earliest and clearest. This is the greatest happiness in my life. This happiness is given to me by the PLA.

"I Am a Servant of the People"

One night, Red Guard Song Rongjiu, who was staying at the 401 Office Reception Station, suddenly developed a high fever. He was delirious and bleeding from the nose. PLA platoon leader Han Xingtian discovered this and immediately went to the medical room to find a doctor. After examination, it was decided to send him to the hospital.

There were no cars at night, and temporarily finding a car would delay time. Han Xingtian thought: Chairman Mao teaches us to be extremely responsible in our work and extremely enthusiastic towards comrades and the people. We must quickly send the patient to the hospital without delay. So, Han Xingtian picked up Song Rongjiu and ran to the hospital. After running a short distance, he noticed that Song Rongjiu had not had time to put on his shoes and socks, so he immediately took off his own shoes and socks and put them on Song Rongjiu, running barefoot on the cold street.

The doctors and nurses were deeply moved to see the PLA soldier carrying the patient to the hospital barefoot. They immediately began emergency treatment. When Song Rongjiu regained consciousness and saw Han Xingtian by his bedside, feeding him water and medicine like a family member, and heard that it was he who carried him to the hospital barefoot, he couldn't help but shed tears of emotion. Song Rongjiu excitedly expressed his determination to be like Han Xingtian, serving the people wholeheartedly, and being a good student of Chairman Mao. Han Xingtian humbly said: I am a servant of the people, this is what I should do.

Whose Clothes Were Washed and Mended?

One afternoon, in the Public Security Department Reception Station, a Red Guard returned from an outside visit and found that the clothes he had changed in the morning were washed clean and dry, and the torn parts were mended neatly. Who washed and mended them? He asked other revolutionary little generals and reception staff, and they all said they didn't know. What was the matter?

It turned out that the PLA platoon leader Zhang Yuechun, while helping to tidy up the quarters, found this dirty shirt under the blanket of the Red Guard. Zhang Yuechun picked up the shirt, and his mind immediately appeared with several shining golden words: "...our cadres must care for every soldier, and all revolutionary troops must care for, love, and help each other." So, he followed Chairman Mao's teachings, tidied up the quarters, washed the Red Guard's shirt clean, dried it on the radiator, and took out a sewing kit from his backpack, which he had brought from the army, and mended the torn parts.

Later, the Red Guard, after learning the truth from various sources, said with emotion: "The PLA sent by Chairman Mao is truly serving the people in every way. I must listen to Chairman Mao's words like the PLA and be a Red Guard who serves the people 'completely' and 'thoroughly'."

The soldiers of a certain unit of the PLA, in the work of receiving Red Guards coming to Beijing, established deep class feelings with the revolutionary little generals. They often studied the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" together and exchanged learning experiences.

    解放军带红卫兵的故事
    这里发表的几篇“解放军带红卫兵的故事”，非常动人。
    在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，解放军的许多干部和战士，参加了首都接待外地革命师生的工作。他们在和革命小将们相处的日子里，按照毛主席的教导，无微不至地关怀和爱护红卫兵，体现了全心全意为人民服务的精神，体现了解放军的光荣传统。他们的行动，深深地感动着革命小将们，也深深地教育着革命小将们。　——编　者
    为了让我看到毛主席
    我是从吉林来的一个红卫兵。我的左腿因为闹病残废了，走路的时候，要用左手拄着左膝盖，走得慢，而且很费劲。
    毛主席检阅我们红卫兵和革命师生的幸福时刻到了，这是我们多么渴望的一天啊！别的同学，高兴得又蹦又跳，唯独我坐在一边发愁。负责带领我们的解放军排长钱兆友同志，一眼就看透了我的心事。他微笑着走过来，扶着我的头说：“别着急，一定让你见到毛主席！”
    队伍出发了，我跟在后边走，但走了不远，就拉了一大截。我又急又累，浑身直冒汗。正在这时，钱兆友同志快步走了过来，二话没说，背起我就往前跑。我伏在他的背上，越想越不是滋味：一个十八九岁的小伙子，怎么能让人背着走呢！我挣扎着要求下来。但是不管我说什么，他就是不肯，紧紧地搂着我的双腿往前跑。
    这时，我心里激动万分，暗暗想着：要是在旧社会，像我这样的人，别说不能来北京，就是到了北京，谁能看得起！可是今天，毛主席把我们当作客人请到北京来，还派解放军接待我们，真是做梦也想不到的事情啊！想着想着，感激的眼泪像断线的珠子掉了下来。钱兆友同志听见我哭，就轻声地安慰我说：“不要过意不去，我们都是阶级兄弟，你的困难就是我的困难，只要能让你见到毛主席，再累我也愉快。”这些充满阶级友爱的话，句句打动着我的心，感激的泪水一滴一滴落在他的棉袄上。
    钱兆友同志一气把我背了十几里，使我按时到达了预定地点。他把我放在最前边，使我最早地、最清楚地看到了我们心中的红太阳——伟大领袖毛主席。这是我一生中最大的幸福。这个幸福，是解放军给我的。

    “我是人民的勤务员”
    一天深夜，住在四○一机关接待站的红卫兵宋荣九，突然发起高烧来。他烧得头昏眼花，鼻孔出血。解放军排长韩兴田查铺发现后，马上到医务室找来医生。经过诊断，决定把他送进医院。
    深夜没有车，临时找车又怕耽误时间。韩兴田想：毛主席教导我们，对工作要极端的负责任，对同志对人民要极端的热忱，得赶紧把病人送到医院，一刻也耽误不得。于是，韩兴田背起宋荣九就往医院跑。走不多远，他发现宋荣九没来得及穿鞋袜，他又毫不犹豫地脱下鞋袜给宋荣九穿上，自己光着脚跑在冰冷的马路上。
    医生和护士看见解放军同志光着脚把病人背来医院，非常感动，便立即进行抢救。当宋荣九清醒过来，看到韩兴田同志守在床头，像亲人一样喂水喂药，又听说是他光着脚把自己背到医院时，不由地流下了热泪。宋荣九激动地表示：一定要像韩兴田同志一样，全心全意为人民服务，做毛主席的好学生。韩兴田却谦虚地说：我是人民的勤务员，这是我应该做的。

    衣服是谁洗净缝好的？
    一天下午，在公安部接待站里，一个红卫兵从外边串连回来，发现自己早晨换下的衣服，洗得干干净净，几处破了的地方也缝得结结实实。是谁给洗净缝好的？他打听了其他的革命小将和接待人员，都说不知道。到底是怎么回事呢？
    原来是这样：解放军派来的指导员张月春在帮助整理内务时，在这位红卫兵的被子底下，发现了这件脏衣服。张月春拿起衣服，脑子里立刻现出几个金光闪闪的大字：“……我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”于是，他就按照毛主席的教导，把内务整理好以后，把那位红卫兵的衣服洗得干干净净，在暖气上烤干，又从自己的背包里拿出从部队里带来的传家宝——针线包，把破了的地方缝好。
    后来，那位红卫兵经过多方面了解，知道了这件事的真相。他感动地说：“毛主席派来的解放军，真是处处为人民。我一定要像解放军那样，坚决听毛主席的话，做一个‘完全’、‘彻底’为人民服务的红小兵。”
