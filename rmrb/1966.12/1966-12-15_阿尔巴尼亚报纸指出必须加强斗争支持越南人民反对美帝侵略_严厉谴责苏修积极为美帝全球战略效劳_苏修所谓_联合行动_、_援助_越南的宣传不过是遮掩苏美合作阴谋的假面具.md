	Albanian newspapers have pointed out the need to strengthen the struggle to support the Vietnamese people in their resistance against U.S. aggression. They have severely condemned the Soviet revisionists for actively serving the global strategy of U.S. imperialism. The Soviet revisionists' propaganda about "joint actions" and "aid" to Vietnam is merely a mask to cover up their conspiracy of cooperation with the U.S.

	New China News Agency, Tirana, December 13th - Today, the editorial department of the Albanian newspaper "Unity" published an article severely condemning the Soviet revisionists for actively serving the global strategy of U.S. imperialism.

	The article states that the agreement reached by the Khrushchev revisionists and U.S. imperialists on the "Treaty on the Peaceful Use of Outer Space" is a new deception aimed at deceiving the people of various countries. It is part of the Khrushchev revisionists' grand conspiracy to achieve "complete and thorough disarmament" and create a world "without weapons, without armies, without war." It is another result of the U.S.-Soviet deal.

	The article states that the purpose of the space deal between U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists is to divert the attention of revolutionary people in various countries from many unresolved issues, to give U.S.-Soviet cooperation a peaceful appearance, and to open the door for them to make new deals.

	The article points out that the Khrushchev revisionists are the greatest splitters in the international communist movement. Recently, the Khrushchev revisionists' splitting and anti-China activities at the 16th Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions held in Sofia are part of a series of counter-revolutionary conspiracies by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. The Khrushchev revisionists, on the one hand, embrace imperialism and actively cooperate with it against the people of various countries, and on the other hand, do their utmost to destroy international organizations; on the one hand, they shout about "joint actions" and "common anti-imperialism," and on the other hand, they illegally deprived the Chinese trade union delegation of their right to attend the 16th meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions. This is another great service that the Khrushchev revisionists have done for the reactionary forces of imperialism, aiming to sabotage the revolutionary struggle of the working class around the world.

	The article concludes by saying that the Khrushchev revisionists are further splitting and destroying the socialist camp and the workers' movement, serving the global strategy of U.S. imperialism. Therefore, raising revolutionary vigilance and exposing the fifth column of imperialism, the Khrushchev revisionists, is the best way to avoid the harm of imperialist and revisionist conspiracies.

	New China News Agency, Tirana, December 13th - The editorial department of the Albanian newspaper "Labor" published an article on the 13th titled: "The Khrushchev Revisionists are the Most Frenzied Enemies and Greatest Splitters of the Unity of the World Federation of Trade Unions."

	The article states that the Soviet revisionists and their followers in the World Federation of Trade Unions have turned the 16th Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions held in Sofia into a platform for anti-China and anti-Albania activities, destroying the unity of the international working class. This is another great service to U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression, and a public cooperation with the most reactionary forces in the world in their attack on the vital interests of the international working class.

	The article points out that the Soviet revisionists are not interested in the unity of the working class and its organizations; they are only concerned with U.S.-Soviet unity to establish U.S.-Soviet hegemony in the world. Now, the Soviet revisionists have become the greatest splitters in the international workers' movement and the most loyal servants of U.S. imperialism.

	The article states that today, the major internationalist task facing the workers of the world is to strengthen the struggle, support the heroic Vietnamese people, and oppose U.S. imperialist aggression. However, the Soviet revisionists deliberately sabotage the 16th Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions from completing this great task. This once again clearly proves that the Soviet revisionists' endless propaganda about "joint actions" and "aid" to the Vietnamese people is merely two-faced rhetoric, a mask to cover up the conspiracy of U.S.-Soviet cooperation.

	The article states that our current urgent task is to expose and condemn all aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism. However, the Soviet revisionists and their followers do not allow the 16th Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions to discuss this issue. They are primarily concerned with friendship and cooperation with the butchers of the Vietnamese people and openly encourage U.S. imperialism to continue its aggressive policies, establish a "ring of fire" against China, and expand its aggression in the Far East. But these conspiracies will inevitably meet with a shameful failure. The Chinese working class, like the 700 million people of China, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, is holding high the banner of the revolution of the proletariat and the oppressed peoples of all countries. Great China has become an indestructible fortress of socialism and world peace.

	The article states that the international working class angrily condemns the splitting and destructive activities of the Soviet revisionists and their anti-proletarian stance at the 16th Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions, seeing it as an unprecedented betrayal by the Khrushchev revisionists and their followers of the working class's struggle for freedom and rights. The international working class and its true revolutionary organizations will redouble their efforts to smash the conspiracies of imperialists and revisionists and will forge an iron unity in the struggle against imperialism and against the betrayal of Khrushchev revisionism.

	The article states that our country's trade union delegation took a correct and principled stance at the 16th Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions, expressing the wishes of our country's working class and its organizations. Our working class believes that the revolutionary principles of the proletariat will certainly triumph in the world trade union movement. The Soviet revisionists and their followers will inevitably suffer a shameful failure.

    阿尔巴尼亚报纸指出必须加强斗争支持越南人民反对美帝侵略
    严厉谴责苏修积极为美帝全球战略效劳
    苏修所谓“联合行动”、“援助”越南的宣传不过是遮掩苏美合作阴谋的假面具
    新华社地拉那十三日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》今天发表编辑部文章，严厉谴责苏联修正主义者积极地为美帝国主义的全球战略效劳。
    文章说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者和美帝国主义者刚刚就签订“和平利用外层空间条约”所达成的协议是欺骗各国人民的一个新骗局，是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者关于实行“全面彻底裁军”和实现“没有武器，没有军队，没有战争的世界”这个大阴谋的组成部分，是美苏交易的又一结果。
    文章说，美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者进行的外层空间交易的目的在于转移各国革命人民对许多悬而未决的问题的注意力，给美苏合作穿上一件和平外衣，并为他们进行新交易敞开大门。
    文章指出，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者是国际共产主义运动的最大的分裂者。最近，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在索非亚召开的世界工联第十六次理事会会议上进行的分裂和反华活动，是美帝国主义和苏联修正主义一系列反革命阴谋活动的组成部分。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者一方面和帝国主义拥抱，和帝国主义积极合作，反对各国人民，另一方面又竭尽破坏国际组织之能事；一方面他们大叫大嚷所谓“联合行动”、“共同反帝”，另一方面又在世界工联第十六次会议上非法剥夺了中国工会代表团出席这次会议的合法权利。这是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者对帝国主义反动势力的又一次大效劳，其目的在于破坏世界工人阶级的革命斗争。
    文章最后说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者正在进一步分裂和破坏社会主义阵营和工人运动，为美帝国主义的全球战略效劳。因此，提高革命警惕和揭露帝国主义的第五纵队赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，是免受帝国主义和修正主义阴谋危害的最好办法。
    新华社地拉那十三日电　阿尔巴尼亚《劳动报》十三日发表编辑部文章，题目是：《赫鲁晓夫修正主义者是世界工联团结的最疯狂的敌人和最大的分裂者》。
    文章说，苏联修正主义者及其在世界工联内的追随者把在索非亚举行的世界工联十六次理事会会议变成了一个反华、反阿尔巴尼亚的讲坛，破坏了国际工人阶级的团结。这是对美帝国主义推行侵略政策的又一巨大效劳，是苏联修正主义者在向国际工人阶级的切身利益的进攻中，同世界最反动的势力的公开合作。
    文章指出，苏联修正主义者对工人阶级及其组织的团结并不感兴趣，他们关心的只是美苏团结，以便建立美苏在世界的霸权。现在，苏联修正主义者已成了国际工人运动最大的分裂者和美帝国主义的忠实的奴仆。
    文章说，今天，摆在世界工人面前的重大国际主义的任务是：加强斗争，支持英雄的越南人民，反对美帝国主义侵略。但是，苏联修正主义者有计划地破坏世界工联理事会议完成这一巨大任务。这再次清楚地证明，苏联修正主义者关于“联合行动”、“援助”越南人民的喋喋不休的宣传，只不过是两面派的空话，是遮掩苏美合作阴谋的假面具。
    文章说，我们当前的迫切任务是揭露和谴责美帝国主义的一切侵略活动。但是，苏联修正主义及其追随者不准世界工联理事会会议讨论这个问题。他们关心的首先是同屠杀越南人民的凶手的友谊和合作，并公开鼓励美帝国主义继续推行侵略政策，建立针对中国的“火力包围圈”，扩大在远东的侵略。但是，他们这些阴谋诡计必将遭到可耻的失败。中国工人阶级，同中国七亿人民一样，在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的英明领导下，高举无产阶级和各国被压迫人民革命的旗帜，伟大的人民中国已成为社会主义和世界和平的不可摧毁的堡垒。
    文章说，国际工人阶级愤怒谴责苏联修正主义者的分裂和破坏活动，及其在世界工联十六次理事会会议上的反无产阶级立场，并把它看作是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其追随者对工人阶级争取自由和权利斗争的史无前例的背叛。国际工人阶级及其真正的革命组织将加倍努力，粉碎帝国主义者和修正主义者的阴谋，并将在反对帝国主义和反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的背叛的斗争中建立起钢铁般的团结。
    文章说，我国工会代表团在世界工联理事会会议上采取了正确和原则的立场，表达了我国工人阶级及其组织的愿望。我国工人阶级相信，无产阶级的革命原则必将在世界工会运动中取得胜利。苏联修正主义者及其追随者必将遭到可耻的失败。
