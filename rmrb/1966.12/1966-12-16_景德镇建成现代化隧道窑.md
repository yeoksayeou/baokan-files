Jingdezhen Ceramic Factory workers have been actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Recently, they have efficiently and economically built a set of three 97-meter-long modern tunnel kilns for firing daily-use ceramics. The trial production has been successfully completed.

The 97-meter-long tunnel kilns for firing daily-use ceramics have the advantages of high production capacity, low heat consumption, high product quality, good working conditions, and ease of mechanization. Compared to similar-sized reverberatory kilns, the annual production capacity is three to four times higher.

    景德镇瓷厂职工活学活用毛主席著作，最近多快好省地建成一组（三座）九十七米焙烧日用瓷现代化隧道窑，并成功地进行了试生产。
    九十七米焙烧日用瓷隧道窑具有生产量大、热耗低、制品质量较高、劳动条件较好和便于实行机械化等优点。与容积相仿的倒焰窑比较，年产量大三、四倍。
