		New China News Agency, Hanoi, December 23rd – Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam wrote a letter to the American people on the 23rd, expressing support for the American people's just struggle against the Johnson administration's aggression in Vietnam.

		In his letter, Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out that the U.S. government has dispatched over 400,000 American troops and mercenaries, thousands of aircraft, and hundreds of warships to invade Vietnam, killing Vietnamese people day and night, destroying villages and cities, and committing extremely barbaric crimes. Recently, U.S. aircraft have also continuously bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi.

		Chairman Ho Chi Minh stated in his letter that due to the criminal war instigated by the U.S. government, tens of thousands of American youth have been forced to join the military, leaving their homes to die innocently on the battlefields of Vietnam. However, the U.S. government continues to shout about "peace talks," attempting to deceive the American people and the people of the world. In reality, it is escalating the war.

		Chairman Ho Chi Minh emphasized in his letter that the U.S. government is trying to force the Vietnamese people to surrender through brutal force. However, the Vietnamese people will never surrender at any time. We love peace, but it must be genuine peace based on independence and freedom. For independence and freedom, the Vietnamese people are not afraid of hardship and sacrifice and will resolutely fight the struggle against American aggression to complete victory.

		Chairman Ho Chi Minh expressed in his letter his ardent support for the American people's just struggle to demand that the U.S. government stop the war of aggression in Vietnam and withdraw all U.S. troops from South Vietnam.

    越南人民在任何时候都决不屈服
    坚决把抗美斗争进行到彻底胜利
    新华社河内二十三日电　越南民主共和国主席胡志明，二十三日写信给美国人民，支持美国人民为反对约翰逊政府侵略越南而进行的正义斗争。
    胡志明主席在信中指出，美国政府派遣四十多万名美军和帮凶军、数以千计的飞机和成百艘军舰侵略越南，日夜屠杀越南人民，摧毁村庄和城市，犯下了极其野蛮的罪行。最近，美国飞机还连续轰炸越南民主共和国的首都河内市。
    胡志明主席在信中说，由于美国政府挑起的罪恶战争，而使数以十万计的美国青年被迫当兵，远离故乡，到越南战场无辜送死。但是，美国政府却喋喋不休地叫嚷“和平谈判”，妄图欺骗美国人民和世界人民。实际上，它是在日益扩大战争。
    胡志明主席在信中强调说，美国政府企图以残暴的武力迫使越南人民投降。但是，越南人民在任何时候都决不屈服。我们热爱和平，但是必须是在独立、自由基础上的真正和平。为了独立、自由，越南人民决不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决把抗击美国侵略者的战斗进行到彻底胜利。
    胡志明主席在信中表示，热烈支持美国人民要美国政府停止侵略越南的战争和把美国军队全部撤出南越的正义斗争。
