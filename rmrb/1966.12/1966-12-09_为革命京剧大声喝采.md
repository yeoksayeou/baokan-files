I am the son of a worker. Both of my parents are veteran workers with decades of service and are also members of the Communist Party. To be honest, I used to not particularly enjoy watching Peking Opera because the lives and characters it portrayed were so far removed from the lives of socialist laborers. Some plays didn't even feature laborers, and some even used them as objects of ridicule. I often thought: what's so great about emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties that they deserve such careful study and analysis, and such passionate portrayal and praise? And what's wrong with laborers that they need to be vilified and belittled? What kind of stance and feelings are these? I couldn't understand it and felt very uncomfortable. I had heard people say: Peking Opera is a thing of the past, and I understood what they meant, feeling anxious that Peking Opera couldn't adapt to the needs of the times.

Fortunately, the situation now is quite different from a few years ago. After watching "Sha Jiahui," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and "The Red Lantern," I can't help but cheer loudly! These plays feature our proletarian heroes! Look at how magnificent they are! Yes, praising the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought is a task that can never be fully accomplished, no matter how many times it is portrayed and praised. These plays have made laborers and the proletariat stand tall on the stage, breathing freely. They have illuminated the ancient Peking Opera stage with a bright red light, sweeping away all ghosts and demons, and banishing all evil winds.

I sincerely hope that more excellent modern Peking Opera performances like these will be staged. I hope that Peking Opera workers will follow the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and advance bravely on the path of Peking Opera revolution, breaking waves and forging ahead!

    为革命京剧大声喝采
    我是一个工人的儿子。我的父母亲都是几十年工龄的老工人，又都是共产党员。说实话，过去我是不太爱看京剧的，因为它所表现的生活和人物，同社会主义时代的劳动人民距离实在太远了。有的戏干脆没劳动人民的份儿，有的戏甚至拿他们当讽刺取笑的对象。我常常这样想：帝王将相、才子佳人，有啥了不起的地方，值得这样地去仔细研究和分析他们，这样热情去表现和歌颂他们？而劳动人民又有啥不是的地方，需要这样去丑化和贬低他们呢？这是什么立场、什么感情啊！我想不通，别扭得很。我曾听人说：京剧是老头子们的东西了，我很理解这句话的意思，为京剧不能适应时代的需要而焦急。
    值得高兴的是，现在的情况比起前几年大不相同了。看了《沙家浜》、《智取威虎山》和《红灯记》，我忍不住要大声喝采！这些戏里演的是我们无产阶级的英雄人物啊！你瞧，有多高大！是的，歌颂用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵，就是表现、歌颂他一千年、一万年，也表现不尽、歌颂不够的啊！这些戏使劳动人民、无产阶级在舞台上扬了眉，吐了气。它们把古老的京剧舞台照得通红通红的，把牛鬼蛇神、妖风邪气一扫而空。
    我衷心希望多多演出这样优秀的京剧现代戏。希望京剧工作者沿着毛主席指出的为工农兵服务的方向，在京剧革命的道路上乘风破浪，不断前进！
