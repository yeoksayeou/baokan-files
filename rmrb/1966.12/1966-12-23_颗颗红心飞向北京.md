Title: Every Red Heart Flies to Beijing

Edition: 6

Upon seeing the letters and red, radiant Mao Zedong badges sent by Red Guards and revolutionary masses, our hearts are stirred with excitement, like the surging waves of the sea. We read your letters over and over, and gaze intently at each golden, shining Mao Zedong badge. Our every red heart flies to Beijing, flies to Tiananmen, flies to the side of Chairman Mao...

Dear comrades, we will surely wear the most precious gift you have sent us—the Mao Zedong badges—on our chests at all times and keep them in our hearts. Wearing them, we take up our rifles to fight the enemy; wearing them, we take up our pens to criticize the bourgeoisie; wearing them, we take up our hoes to battle barren mountains and demand grain from the earth; wearing them, we take up our hammers to work, resolutely turning our units into schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

We firmly respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought, and imprinting Chairman Mao's instructions in our minds, dissolving them in our blood, and putting them into action, completely and thoroughly serving the people. We will be on the frontier but have our hearts in the motherland, with our eyes on the world, and together with the people of Tibet, we will build the southwestern gateway of our motherland into an impregnable fortress against invasion. If the U.S. imperialists and the Indian reactionaries dare to wage war against us, we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate them.

    颗颗红心飞向北京
    看到红卫兵和革命群众寄来的充满火热的革命激情的信和红光灿灿的毛主席像章，我们激动的心情，就像大海里翻滚的波浪一样。我们一遍又一遍地读着你们的信，目不转睛地看着一枚枚金光闪亮的毛主席像章，我们颗颗红心呵，立刻飞向北京，飞向天安门，飞到毛主席身旁……。
    亲爱的同志们，我们一定把你们寄来的最珍贵的礼品——毛主席像章，时时刻刻戴在胸前，亮在心上。我们戴上它，拿起枪杆杀敌人；戴上它，拿起笔杆批判资产阶级；戴上它，拿起锄头向荒山开战，向大地要粮；戴上它，拿起锤子去做工，坚决把我们部队办成毛泽东思想大学校。
    我们坚决响应林彪副主席的号召，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，把毛主席的指示，印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上，完全彻底为人民服务。我们要身在边疆，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，誓和西藏人民一道，把祖国西南大门建设成为反侵略战争的铜墙铁壁。美帝国主义、印度反动派如果胆敢向我们发动战争，我们就坚决、彻底、干净、全部把它们消灭光。
