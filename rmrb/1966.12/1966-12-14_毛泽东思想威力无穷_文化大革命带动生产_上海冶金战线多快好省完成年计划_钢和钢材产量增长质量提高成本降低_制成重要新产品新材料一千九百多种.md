The invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought: The Cultural Revolution drives production
Shanghai's metallurgical front completes the annual plan quickly, efficiently, and economically
Steel and steel product output increases, quality improves, costs decrease; over 1,900 new products and materials created

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 13th—The broad revolutionary workers on Shanghai's metallurgical front, holding high the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have directed the boundless enthusiasm ignited by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into the struggle for production. They have already, on the 6th of this month, completed and surpassed this year's state plan ahead of schedule. The total output of steel and steel products they have produced this year has surpassed last year's; raw material consumption has decreased, and costs have been reduced. Labor productivity has increased by 5.4 percent compared to the same period last year, reaching the highest level in history. Particularly notable is the stable improvement in steel quality; the proportion of alloy steel urgently needed by the state has significantly increased. They have successfully trial-produced over 1,900 kinds of important new products and materials, including ultra-low carbon stainless steel tubes, stainless steel plates, stainless steel wire, and low-temperature stainless steel tubes.

The achievements of Shanghai's metallurgical industry fully prove that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an extremely powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces.

During the Cultural Revolution, the workers on Shanghai's metallurgical front, following the wise instructions of Great Leader Chairman Mao on breaking the foreign framework and forging our own path of industrial development, dared to think, dared to act, dared to make revolution, and dared to rebel. They fully displayed their wisdom and creativity, rapidly pushing Shanghai's metallurgical production to a higher level.

The workers at the Shanghai converter steel plant dared to think and act boldly, using ordinary converters to produce low-alloy steel. The steel products rolled from this low-alloy steel not only have a long service life and are lightweight but, more importantly, can fully utilize our country's abundant metallic elements to develop our own varieties of alloy steel. This is a significant product revolution in the metallurgical industry. Some bourgeois "experts" had once asserted that it was impossible to produce such steel using ordinary converters. The Shanghai converter steel workers were determined not only to win the battle in the cultural revolution but also to win in scientific experiments. When encountering difficulties in the trial production, the workers would gather by the furnace to study Chairman Mao's quotations: "We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficulties there are, the more we must go there. This is what a good comrade should do." Chairman Mao's teachings gave the workers boundless strength. The workers said: Chairman Mao believes in us the most, relies on us the most, and supports our pioneering spirit the most. No matter how difficult it is, we must overcome it. When problems arose during operation, the steelmaking and casting workers would repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings: "In the world, the most feared thing is the two characters 'serious.' The Communist Party is the most serious about these two characters." They worked hard on these two characters, promptly checked and summarized experiences, and managed to produce qualified low-alloy steel using ordinary converters. Currently, Shanghai workers have successfully trial-produced over twenty kinds of low-alloy steel using converters, with more than ten kinds already in production.

During the Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers have shown through their actions that they listen to Chairman Mao the most, are the most revolutionary, and care about production the most. They fearlessly exposed and criticized the capitalist roaders in power within the party and all ghosts and monsters in the struggle; in production and scientific experiments, they are brave and intelligent pioneers. They are determined to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao with the thorough victory of the cultural revolution and the actual actions of improving production. Currently, the broad revolutionary workers on Shanghai's metallurgical front are further grasping the revolution and promoting production, studying the "Old Three Articles," and applying the "Old Three Articles." They are determined to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better and to make production even better, producing more and better steel and steel products for socialism.

They completed the annual steel production task ahead of schedule on November 9th. This is a batch of steel plates produced by the thin plate workshop, ready to be shipped out of the factory.

### 毛泽东思想威力无穷　文化大革命带动生产  上海冶金战线多快好省完成年计划  钢和钢材产量增长质量提高成本降低  制成重要新产品新材料一千九百多种

    毛泽东思想威力无穷　文化大革命带动生产
    上海冶金战线多快好省完成年计划
    钢和钢材产量增长质量提高成本降低  制成重要新产品新材料一千九百多种
    据新华社上海十三日电　上海冶金工业战线广大革命职工高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发起来的冲天干劲用在生产斗争上，已在本月六日提前超额完成了今年的国家计划。他们今年已生产出的钢和钢材，总产量都超过了去年；原材料消耗下降，成本降低；劳动生产率较去年同期增长百分之五点四，创造了历年来的最高水平。特别突出的是钢的质量稳定提高，国家急需的合金钢比重显著增加，并试制成功超低碳不锈钢管、不锈钢板、不锈钢丝、低温不锈钢管等一千九百多种重要的新产品、新材料。
    上海冶金工业的成就充分证明，无产阶级文化大革命是社会生产力发展的极其强大的推动力。
    在文化大革命中，上海冶金工业战线职工遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于打破洋框框，走自己工业发展道路的英明教导，敢想，敢干，敢革命，敢造反，充分发挥出自己的聪明才智，把上海冶金工业生产迅速推向一个更高的水平。
    上海转炉炼钢工人们，敢想敢干，用普通转炉炼出了低合金钢。用这种低合金钢轧制出的钢材，不仅使用寿命长，重量轻，更重要的是冶炼这种钢，可以充分利用我国富有的金属元素，发展我国自己的合金钢种。这是冶金工业一项重要的产品革命。一些资产阶级“专家”曾经断言：用普通转炉是炼不出这种钢来的。上海转炉炼钢工人决心不仅要在文化革命中打胜仗，而且在科学实验中也要打胜仗。在试制工作遇到困难的时候，工人们就围在炉前学习毛主席语录：“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”毛主席的教导给了工人以无穷无尽的力量。工人们说：毛主席最相信我们群众，最依靠我们群众，最支持我们的首创精神，再困难我们也要攻下来。当操作发生问题时，炼钢和浇钢工人们就一次又一次地学习毛主席的教导：“世界上怕就怕
  ‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”他们在“认真”二字上狠下功夫，及时检查总结经验，硬是用普通转炉炼出了合格的低合金钢。目前，上海工人已经用转炉试炼成功二十多种低合金钢，其中有十多种已经投入生产。
    在文化大革命中，广大革命职工以自己的行动说明，他们最听毛主席的话，革命最坚决，最关心生产。他们在揭发批判党内走资本主义道路的当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神的斗争中，无所畏惧；在生产斗争和科学实验中，是智勇双全的闯将。他们决心用夺取文化革命的彻底胜利和搞好生产的实际行动，保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。当前，上海冶金工业战线广大革命职工，正进一步抓革命，促生产，大学“老三篇”，大用“老三篇”，决心把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好，把生产搞得更好，为社会主义生产更多更好的钢和钢材。（附图片）
