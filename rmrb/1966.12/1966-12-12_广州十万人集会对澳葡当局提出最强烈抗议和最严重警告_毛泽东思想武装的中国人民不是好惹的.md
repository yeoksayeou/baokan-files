	100,000 People in Guangzhou Hold Rally to Protest and Warn the Portuguese Authorities in Macau
	The Chinese People Armed with Mao Zedong Thought Are Not to Be Provoked

	The Portuguese authorities in Macau must unconditionally accept and fully implement all the legitimate demands of the Chinese side; attempting to use evasive tricks to escape the serious crime of massacring our fellow countrymen in Macau is a deception that will not fool the people of Macau; if you do not bow your heads and admit your guilt, and stubbornly make enemies of the Chinese people, you will surely suffer a crushing defeat.

	Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 11 – Over 100,000 people from various circles in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, including Red Guards, held a rally this afternoon to strongly condemn and protest against the fascist bloody atrocities committed by Portuguese imperialism in Macau against our fellow countrymen, and to firmly support the just struggle of the people of Macau against oppression.

	Lin Liming, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Acting Governor of Guangdong Province, and representatives of the Red Guards, workers, peasants, and women, spoke at the rally with great indignation. They sternly warned the Portuguese authorities in Macau that they must unconditionally accept and fully implement the four proposals made by the Guangdong Provincial Foreign Affairs Office on behalf of the Chinese side, immediately and unconditionally accept all the just demands of our fellow countrymen in Macau, and immediately punish the main culprits: Army Commander Schreiner, Director of the Police Department Fucili, Deputy Director of the Police Department Yan Danni, and Acting Director of the Island Administration Bureau Yan Deqi, and apologize and compensate the victims for all losses. Otherwise, the Portuguese authorities in Macau will be fully responsible for all the serious consequences that may arise. The rally also strongly demanded that the Portuguese authorities in Macau must ensure that the Kuomintang bandits are not allowed to carry out any activities in Macau, that the Kuomintang bandits and American and British imperialism do not interfere in Macau's affairs, and that the seven Kuomintang bandits seized by the Portuguese authorities in Macau in June 1963 when they intruded into our territorial waters be immediately handed over to the Chinese government for processing.

	This morning, the Red Guards, workers, peasants, cadres, and residents from all directions, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with quotations from Chairman Mao, as well as slogans such as "Strongest Protest Against the Fascist Atrocities of the Portuguese Authorities in Macau Killing Our Fellow Countrymen," chanted slogans and surged towards the rally site from all directions.

	In the center of the main rally site, a giant portrait of our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao was prominently displayed. The rally was filled with enthusiastic shouts: "Strongest Protest Against the Fascist Atrocities of the Portuguese Authorities in Macau Killing Our Fellow Countrymen!" "Salute to the Brave and Unyielding Patriotic Fellow Countrymen in Macau!" "Long Live Our Great Leader Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Years!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!"

	Leaders from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central-South Bureau, Guangdong Province, Guangzhou City, and the Guangzhou garrison, including Wang De, Lin Liming, Liu Tianfu, Zeng Shen, Xu Chongqing, Ke Qingyan, Liu Xinglong, and other department heads, attended the condemnation rally. Zeng Shen, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province and Mayor of Guangzhou City, presided over the rally and delivered the opening speech. He said: With the support of the Kuomintang bandits and American and British imperialism, Portuguese imperialism has repeatedly committed fascist bloody atrocities. This is a serious provocation against the Chinese people. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate the Portuguese authorities in Macau bullying and oppressing our fellow countrymen in Macau. The Guangdong Provincial People's Committee fully supports the brave and just struggle of our fellow countrymen in Macau and strongly protests against the savage fascist bloody atrocities of the Portuguese authorities in Macau. We firmly demand that the Portuguese authorities in Macau immediately and unconditionally accept the just demands of our fellow countrymen in Macau. The Portuguese authorities in Macau must take the declaration issued by the Director of the Guangdong Provincial Foreign Affairs Office seriously.

	Lin Liming said in his speech that the fascist bloody atrocities committed by Portuguese imperialism in Macau against our fellow countrymen have aroused the great indignation of the 40 million people of Guangdong Province, and we absolutely cannot tolerate this. We strongly protest against the Portuguese authorities in Macau. Lin Liming pointed out that this bloody incident was entirely caused by the Portuguese authorities in Macau and was strongly supported by the Kuomintang bandits and American and British imperialists. He said that now the Portuguese authorities in Macau are trying to use the pretext of accepting the five demands of the Chinese residents of Taipa to escape their serious crime of massacring our fellow countrymen in Macau since December 3. It must be pointed out that this is a trick, a conspiracy to evade responsibility, and it will not deceive our fellow countrymen in Macau.

	Lin Liming said, we solemnly warn the Portuguese authorities in Macau that you have committed a heinous crime against our fellow countrymen, and we cannot ignore this. If you persist in your mistakes and continue to bully our fellow countrymen in Macau, dare to massacre Chinese residents in Macau, and attempt to use the Kuomintang bandits and American and British imperialism to interfere in Macau's affairs, we will absolutely not tolerate it, and you will surely suffer a crushing defeat.

	In his speech, Lin Liming enthusiastically praised the patriotic fellow countrymen and students in Macau for showing extraordinary bravery in the face of the ruthless fascist atrocities of the Portuguese authorities in Macau, following the teachings of Chairman Mao. He said that our fellow countrymen in Macau and patriotic students recited Chairman Mao's quotations in the face of fascist thugs, showing that the people armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong are fearless. We firmly support the just actions of our fellow countrymen in Macau.

	Red Guard representative Wu Shixing said, on behalf of the Red Guards of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou City, and all over the country who came to Guangzhou for revolutionary activities, we strongly protest and warn the Portuguese authorities in Macau for their brutal massacre of our fellow countrymen in Macau. You dare to make enemies of the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, which is like an ant shaking a tree! You are too arrogant and too self-deluded. He said, we are the Red Guards led by Chairman Mao personally, and we are also a strong reserve force for the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We are revolutionary rebels armed with Mao Zedong Thought, daring to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire. We are determined to strongly oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. If the Portuguese authorities in Macau do not stop their reckless behavior and admit their guilt, but stubbornly make enemies of the Chinese people to the end, we Red Guards will take all necessary revolutionary actions to oppose you. The Red Guards keep their word.

	Worker representative from Guangzhou City, Xiang Su, warned the Portuguese authorities in Macau that the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be provoked, and our fellow countrymen living in Macau are absolutely not to be bullied by you. Your provocation will surely backfire. We advise these imperialist masters to immediately and thoroughly admit their guilt, otherwise the consequences will be on you, and do not say we did not warn you.

	Peasant representative from the suburbs of Guangzhou City, Liao Mei, said that we, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, are peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and we are fearless. We will surely be a strong backbone for our patriotic fellow countrymen in Macau. If Portuguese imperialism continues to insist on making enemies of the Chinese people, we will surely break your backbone.

	Women's representative from Guangzhou City, Huang Shuhua, speaking on behalf of the women of the province and city, pointed out that women armed with Mao Zedong Thought will absolutely not allow the Portuguese authorities in Macau to act recklessly. We women have made up our minds to firmly support the declaration of the Director of the Guangdong Provincial Foreign Affairs Office, to be a strong backbone for our patriotic fellow countrymen in Macau, and to firmly support the just struggle of our fellow countrymen in Macau against oppression.

	The rally ended with angry slogans and the revolutionary song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

    广州十万人集会对澳葡当局提出最强烈抗议和最严重警告
    毛泽东思想武装的中国人民不是好惹的
    澳葡当局必须无条件地接受并完全实现中国方面一切严正要求；企图用避重就轻的阴谋诡计，来逃脱屠杀我澳门同胞的严重罪责，是欺骗不了澳门同胞的；你们如果不低头认罪，顽固地与中国人民为敌，必将碰得头破血流。
    新华社广州十一日电广东省、广州市各界人民和红卫兵十万多人，今天下午举行集会，愤怒声讨和强烈抗议澳门葡萄牙帝国主义屠杀澳门同胞的法西斯血腥暴行，坚决地支持澳门同胞反迫害的正义斗争。
    中共广东省委书记处书记、广东省代省长林李明和红卫兵、工人、农民、妇女的代表们，以无比愤怒的心情，在大会上发表讲话。他们严正警告澳葡当局，必须无条件地接受并完全实现广东省外事处长奉命提出的四项主张，立即无条件地接受我澳门同胞所提出的一切正义要求，立即严惩主要肇事者：陆军司令施维纳、警察厅长傅基利、警察厅副厅长颜端尼、代理海岛行政局长晏德地等，并向受害者赔礼道歉和赔偿一切损失，否则，由此产生的一切严重后果由澳葡当局负完全责任。大会还强烈提出：澳门葡萄牙当局要切实保证不允许蒋匪特务在澳门进行任何活动，不让蒋匪帮和美英帝国主义干预澳门事务，并把一九六三年六月澳门葡萄牙当局侵入我国水域抢走的七名蒋匪特务立即交还我国政府处理。
    今天午前，红卫兵、工人、农民、机关干部和街道居民举着毛主席画像和毛主席语录牌，以及“最强烈抗议澳葡当局杀害澳门同胞的法西斯暴行”等标语，高呼着口号，从四面八方涌向会场。
    中心会场正中，高挂着我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席巨幅画像。会场上群情激昂地振臂高呼：“最强烈抗议澳葡当局屠杀澳门同胞的暴行！”“向英勇不屈的澳门爱国同胞致敬！”“我们伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    中共中央中南局、广东省、广州市、广州驻军等方面的负责人王德、林李明、刘田夫、曾生、许崇清、寇庆延、刘兴隆以及其他部门负责人，出席了声讨大会。广东省副省长、广州市市长曾生主持大会并致开会词。他说：葡萄牙帝国主义在蒋介石匪帮和美英帝国主义的大力支持下，连续制造法西斯血腥暴行，这是对中国人民的严重挑衅。中国人民绝对不能容忍澳葡当局肆意欺凌和迫害澳门同胞。广东省人民委员会完全支持澳门同胞的英勇的正义斗争，并对澳门葡萄牙当局这种野蛮的法西斯血腥暴行提出最强烈的抗议。我们坚决要求澳门葡萄牙当局立即无条件地接受澳门同胞提出的严正要求。澳葡当局必须认真对待广东省人民委员会外事处长发表的声明。
    林李明在讲话中说，葡萄牙帝国主义屠杀澳门同胞的法西斯血腥暴行，引起了我们广东省四千万人民的极大愤怒，对此我们决不能容忍，我们对澳葡当局表示最强烈的抗议。林李明强调指出，这一血腥事件完全是澳门葡萄牙当局一手造成的，并且得到了蒋匪帮和美英帝国主义者大力支持的。他说，现在澳葡当局企图用伪装接受氹仔中国居民五项要求的办法，来逃脱它在十二月三日以来大规模屠杀我澳门同胞的严重罪责。必须指出，这是一个骗局，是一个企图避重就轻的阴谋诡计，它欺骗不了澳门同胞。
    林李明说，我们严正警告澳门葡萄牙当局，你们对我们的同胞犯下了滔天大罪，我们决不能置之不理。如果你们执迷不悟，还要欺负我澳门同胞，还敢残杀在澳门的中国居民，还企图利用蒋匪帮、美英帝国主义来干预澳门的事务，我们是绝对不能容忍的，你们必将碰得头破血流。
    林李明在讲话中热烈赞扬澳门爱国同胞和爱国师生，在澳门葡萄牙当局穷凶极恶的法西斯暴行面前，遵照毛主席的教导，表现了非常英勇的气概。他说，澳门同胞和爱国师生在法西斯暴徒面前高声朗诵毛主席语录，表现了用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的人民是无所畏惧的。我们对澳门同胞的正义行动表示最坚决的支持。
    红卫兵代表吴世兴说，我代表广东省、广州市以及全国各地来广州串连的红卫兵，对澳门葡萄牙当局残酷屠杀澳门同胞提出最强烈的抗议和最严重的警告，你们竟然胆敢与毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民为敌，真是蚍蜉撼大树！你们太猖狂了，太不自量力了。他说，我们是毛主席亲自领导的红卫兵，也是中国人民解放军的坚强后备力量，我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命造反者，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，我们就是要大造帝国主义的反，大造现代修正主义和各国反动派的反。澳葡当局如不悬崖勒马，低头认罪，而是顽固地与中国人民为敌到底，我们红卫兵将采取一切必要的革命行动，造你们的反。我们红卫兵说话是算数的。
    广州市工人代表向苏说，我们警告澳门葡萄牙当局，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不好惹的，住在澳门的我国同胞是绝对不准你们欺负的。你们的挑衅必将搬起石头砸自己的脚。奉劝你们这些帝国主义老爷们，立即彻底低头认罪，否则后果自负，勿谓言之不预。
    广州市郊区农民代表廖妹说，我们广大贫下中农，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的农民，我们是无所畏惧的。我们誓作澳门爱国同胞的坚强后盾。如果葡萄牙帝国主义继续坚持与中国人民为敌，我们一定要打断你们的脊骨。
    广州市妇女代表黄淑华代表省、市妇女在讲话中指出，用毛泽东思想武装起来的妇女，决不允许澳门葡萄牙当局逞凶。我们妇女已经下了决心，坚决拥护广东省人民委员会外事处长的声明，誓作澳门爱国同胞的坚强后盾，坚决支持澳门同胞反迫害的正义斗争。
    大会最后在愤怒的口号声和高唱《大海航行靠舵手》的革命歌声中结束。
