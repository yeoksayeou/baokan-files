The Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries held a reception tonight to warmly welcome the delegation from the (orthodox) Yamaguchi Prefecture Friendship Association of Japan-China Friendship Association, headed by Kokuya Shoichiro.

	President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, Liao Chengzhi, attended the reception.

	At the reception filled with the atmosphere of combat friendship, Liao Chengzhi and Kokuya Shoichiro spoke successively. Liao Chengzhi, in his speech, expressed his warm welcome to the Yamaguchi Prefecture delegation, who are holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, visiting China.

	He said that in Japan, those who firmly believe in Marxism-Leninism and are determined to defeat revisionism are the ones who will ultimately prevail.

	Liao Chengzhi emphasized that no matter how much the U.S. imperialists, the reactionary Sato government, Soviet modern revisionism, and their various followers try to sabotage it, the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan is something that no one can destroy or obstruct.

	He expressed his firm belief that in Japan, the true forces fighting for Sino-Japanese friendship, the forces holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, will surely grow stronger and ultimately bury the U.S. imperialists, Japanese militarism, Soviet modern revisionism, and their various followers.

	Kokuya Shoichiro, in his speech, enthusiastically praised the combat friendship between the peoples of Japan and China in their struggle against their common enemy, U.S. imperialism. He pointed out that in Japan, the vast majority of people hope for friendship and unity between the peoples of Japan and China, while only a small handful are anti-China.

	He said that the enemy is actually a paper tiger. In our struggle, as long as we grasp Mao Zedong Thought, rely on the masses, we will be able to achieve victory.

	Kokuya Shoichiro condemned Soviet modern revisionism for betraying the world revolution and degenerating into a lackey of U.S. imperialism. He stressed that Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, play a decisive role in the struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialism and all its running dogs, and are invincible. He expressed that the revolutionary people of Yamaguchi Prefecture and the Japan-China friendship people will strive to the end to further promote the friendship and unity between the peoples of Japan and China for generations to come.

    任何人也破坏不了中日人民的友谊
    中日友协热烈欢迎日中友协（正统）山口县友好代表团
    据新华社八日讯　中日友协今晚举行招待会，热烈欢迎以古谷庄一郎为首的日中友协（正统）山口县友好代表团。
    中日友协会长廖承志出席了招待会。
    在充满着战斗友谊气氛的招待会上，廖承志和古谷庄一郎先后讲话。廖承志在讲话中表示热烈欢迎高举马克思列宁主义旗帜的山口县友好代表团来中国访问。
    他说，在日本高举马克思列宁主义旗帜的人，坚决相信马克思列宁主义终究要战胜修正主义。
    廖承志强调指出，不管美帝国主义、佐藤反动政府、苏联现代修正主义及其形形色色的追随者怎样破坏，中日两国人民的友谊是任何人破坏不了、阻挡不了的。
    他表示坚信，在日本真正为日中友好而斗争的力量，高举马克思列宁主义旗帜的力量，一定会日益壮大，并最后葬送美帝国主义、日本军国主义、苏联现代修正主义，及其形形色色的追随者。
    古谷庄一郎在讲话中，热烈赞扬日中两国人民在反对共同敌人美帝国主义斗争的战斗友谊。他指出，在日本希望日中两国人民友好和团结的是绝大多数人，而反华的只是一小撮人。
    他说，敌人实际上是纸老虎。我们在斗争中，只要掌握毛泽东思想，依靠群众，就能取得胜利。
    古谷庄一郎谴责苏联现代修正主义背叛了世界革命，堕落成为美帝国主义的帮凶。他强调指出，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国共产党和中国人民，在各国人民同帝国主义及其所有走狗的斗争中，起着决定性的作用，是无敌于天下的。他表示：山口县革命人民和日中友好人士将为进一步促进日中人民世世代代的友好团结奋斗到底。
