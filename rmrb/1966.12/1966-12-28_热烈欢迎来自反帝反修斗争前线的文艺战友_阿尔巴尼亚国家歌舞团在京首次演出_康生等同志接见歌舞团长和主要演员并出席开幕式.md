The Chinese people have long been eagerly awaiting the Albanian National Song and Dance Ensemble, which is filled with the comradeship, fraternity, and revolutionary spirit of the people of Albania. Tonight, they performed for the first time in Beijing at the Capital Theatre. The artistic comrades from the frontline of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle presented a splendid performance full of revolutionary passion and fighting spirit, which was warmly welcomed by over a thousand spectators from the capital.

Party and state leaders Kang Sheng, Li Xiannian, and Guo Moruo attended the opening ceremony and watched the performance.

The Capital Theatre was filled with a strong atmosphere of unity and struggle between the peoples of China and Albania. The curtains in the center of the stage displayed the national flags of both countries. Large red banners inside and outside the theatre carried two excerpts from the congratulatory message sent by our great leader Chairman Mao to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour: "'Though we are separated by mountains and seas, our hearts are united.' The peoples of China and Albania, though far apart, have hearts that beat as one. We are your true friends and comrades. You are our true friends and comrades. We are not false friends who speak sweetly but harbor malice. We are not two-faced. Our revolutionary and fighting friendship has withstood the test of storms and tempests." "The parties and peoples of China and Albania should unite, all Marxist-Leninists in the world should unite, all revolutionary peoples in the world should unite. We must overthrow imperialism, overthrow modern revisionism, and overthrow the reactionaries of all countries. A new world without imperialism, without capitalism, without exploitation, must be established."

The spectators from the capital and the Albanian artistic comrades were filled with enthusiasm, repeatedly shouting in unison: "Mao Zedong—Enver," "Enver—Mao Zedong."

The performance began with a chorus singing in praise of the Albanian Party of Labour and Comrade Enver Hoxha, and of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. The first item was a grand chorus where male and female singers first performed a song praising the glory and wisdom of the Albanian Party of Labour and Comrade Enver Hoxha. They then sang "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" in Chinese. The singers' passionate voices earned them prolonged, enthusiastic applause from the audience, who requested that the two songs be performed again.

The Albanian artistic comrades then performed over thirty musical and dance items. The chorus "In Praise of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour," "One Hand with a Pickaxe, One Hand with a Gun," the solo "The Plot of the Revisionists Has Failed," "Today is the Day of the Cooperative," the dances "Dance of the Eagles," "Soldiers and Civilians as One," "Dance of the Guerrillas," the violin solo "Singing of a Happy Future," and the double-stringed instrument solo "The Strongest Voice of the Revolutionary People" all vividly reflected the great achievements of the brave Albanian people under the correct leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labour in their struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, and in the socialist construction of their homeland. They embodied the revolutionary spirit and fighting will of the Albanian people. Almost every item was performed again to the enthusiastic applause of the audience, with some items performed twice.

A singer with a "Red Guard" armband on her arm, holding a bright red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," walked to the front of the stage. Accompanied by the music, she sang in Chinese, "We Should Believe in the Masses, We Should Believe in the Party." The Albanian artistic comrades' love for Chairman Mao deeply moved the spectators from the capital. At this moment, both the stage and the audience sang together, "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party. These are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then we can accomplish nothing."

In the final performance, the stage was filled with many Albanians and Chinese dressed as workers, peasants, soldiers, and students, dancing joyfully together. This "Dance of Friendship" vividly portrayed the eternal revolutionary friendship between the two parties and peoples of China and Albania. When the portraits of Comrade Enver Hoxha and Chairman Mao appeared on the stage backdrop, the entire audience erupted in thunderous applause and enthusiastic cheers.

Before the performance, a grand opening ceremony was held. Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Song Yiping, and the Director of the Albanian National Song and Dance Ensemble, Ba Pejo, both gave speeches at the opening ceremony. Song Yiping said that the Albanian National Song and Dance Ensemble is visiting and performing in China during the new high tide of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution. They not only brought the deep affection of the brotherly Albanian people to the Chinese people but also brought the revolutionary, national, and combative song and dance art of the Albanian people, as well as the rich fruits of the Albanian people's cultural revolution. He said that through this visit and performance by the Albanian National Song and Dance Ensemble, the artistic workers of the two countries will learn from each other and exchange experiences, which will definitely make the revolutionary art of the proletariat shine even more brightly and make literature and art better serve proletarian politics.

Ba Pejo, in his speech, warmly praised the great proletarian cultural revolution currently being carried out in depth in our country. He said that we congratulate this revolution and are happy about the victory achieved in this revolution in the struggle against bourgeois revisionist ideology in the realm of people's souls, culture, and other aspects of life. This victory has shattered the dreams of imperialists and revisionists to restore capitalism in China. He said that the people and the Party of Labour of Albania and the great people and the Communist Party of China are advancing on the same revolutionary path. The visit of the Albanian National Song and Dance Ensemble to China will lay another cornerstone for the indestructible friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

At the end of the performance, the audience once again shouted "Mao Zedong—Enver," "Enver—Mao Zedong," and sang loudly, "The Boat Needs a Helmsman." Kang Sheng, Li Xiannian, and Guo Moruo walked onto the stage, shaking hands and embracing the performers warmly, congratulating them on their successful performance.

Relevant officials Liu Xiao, Zhang Qiao, Li Wei, Zhou Yiping, and others also attended the opening ceremony. Albanian Ambassador to China, Vasili Natanaeli, and other Albanian comrades in Beijing were also invited to attend.

    新华社二十七日讯　中国人民盼望已久的阿尔巴尼亚国家歌舞团，满怀着同志、战友和兄弟的情谊，今晚在首都剧场举行访华首次演出。来自反帝反修斗争前线的文艺战友们充满革命激情和战斗气息的精采表演，受到首都一千多观众的热烈欢迎。
    党和国家领导人康生、李先念、郭沫若，出席开幕式并观看了演出。
    首都剧场今晚洋溢着中阿两国人民团结战斗的强烈气氛。舞台正中的帷幕上悬挂着中国和阿尔巴尼亚两国国旗。剧场内外的红色巨幅标语上，写着我们伟大领袖毛主席致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会贺电的两段电文：“‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。我们和你们都不是那种口蜜腹剑的假朋友，不是那种两面派。我们之间的革命的战斗的友谊，经历过急风暴雨的考验。”“中阿两党、两国人民团结起来，全世界马克思列宁主义者团结起来，全世界革命人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派。一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界，一定要建立起来。”
    参加开幕式的首都观众和阿尔巴尼亚文艺战友们热情洋溢，一再齐声欢呼：“毛泽东—恩维尔”、“恩维尔—毛泽东”。
    演出在歌颂阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志、歌颂中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的嘹亮歌声中开始。第一个节目是大合唱，男女歌唱演员们先演唱了一首颂扬阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志的光荣和英明的歌曲，接着，用中国话演唱《大海航行靠舵手》。演员们满怀激情的歌声，博得了全场长时间的热烈鼓掌，并且在观众的要求下重新演唱了这两首歌。
    阿尔巴尼亚文艺战士们，随后演出了三十多个音乐和舞蹈节目。合唱《歌颂劳动党第五次代表大会》、《一手拿镐、一手拿枪》，女声独唱《修正主义者的阴谋破产了》、《今天是合作社的节日》，舞蹈《山鹰之舞》、《军民一家》、《游击队之舞》，小提琴独奏《歌唱幸福的未来》和双弦琴独奏《革命人民的最强音》，都真切地反映了英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导下，在反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的斗争中，在祖国社会主义建设中，所取得的伟大成就，体现了阿尔巴尼亚人民的革命气概和战斗精神。在演出中，差不多每个节目都在观众的热烈掌声中重演了一次，有的重演了两次。
    一位歌唱演员手臂上戴着“红卫兵”袖章，高举着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》走向台前，随着伴奏，用中国话高唱毛主席语录歌《我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党》。阿尔巴尼亚文艺战友对毛主席的热爱使首都观众很激动，这时台上台下同声高唱：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”
    演出的最后，舞台上出现了许多阿尔巴尼亚和中国打扮的工人、农民、士兵和学生，他们欢乐地在一起热情起舞。这个《友谊之舞》，把中阿两党两国和两国人民永恒的革命情谊集中地表现了出来。当恩维尔·霍查同志的画像和毛主席的画像在舞台布景上映现时，全场观众掌声雷动，热烈欢腾。
    演出之前举行了隆重的开幕式。对外文化联络委员会副主任宋一平和阿尔巴尼亚国家歌舞团团长巴·佩约先后在开幕式上讲话。宋一平说，阿尔巴尼亚国家歌舞团，是在我国无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮中来到我国进行访问演出的。他们不仅带来了兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民的深情厚谊，而且也为中国人民带来了阿尔巴尼亚人民革命的、民族的、富于战斗性的歌舞艺术，带来了阿尔巴尼亚人民思想文化革命方面的丰硕果实。他说，通过阿尔巴尼亚国家歌舞团的这次访问演出，中阿两国艺术工作者互相学习，互相交流经验，一定能够使无产阶级的革命艺术发出更加灿烂的光辉，使文艺更好地为无产阶级政治服务。
    巴·佩约在讲话中热烈赞扬我国正在深入开展着的无产阶级文化大革命。他说，我们祝贺这场革命，并为这一场革命在反对人们灵魂中，文化方面和其他生活领域中的资产阶级修正主义思想的斗争中所取得的胜利而感到高兴。这个胜利粉碎了帝国主义和修正主义者在中国复辟资本主义的梦想。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民和劳动党同伟大的中国人民和中国共产党，是在同一条革命的道路上前进的。阿尔巴尼亚国家歌舞团这次到中国访问，将对阿中两国人民战斗的牢不可破的友谊大厦奠下又一块基石。
    演出结束时，全场又一次响起“毛泽东—恩维尔”、“恩维尔—毛泽东”的欢呼声和《大海航行靠舵手》的高昂歌声。康生、李先念、郭沫若等同志走上舞台，同演员们热烈握手，亲切拥抱，祝贺他们演出成功。
    有关方面负责人刘晓、张奚若、李伟、周一萍等，也出席了开幕式。阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使瓦西里·纳塔奈利，以及在北京的其他阿尔巴尼亚同志也应邀出席。
