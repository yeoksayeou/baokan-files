A delegation from the Sino-Sri Lanka Friendship Association, which had recently returned from a visit to China, enthusiastically cheered "Long live the Chinese people!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" and "Long live Chairman Mao!" upon hearing the news of China's successful nuclear test on the evening of the 28th.

They received this news at a reception held by the Chinese Embassy in their honor. They expressed their congratulations to the staff of the Chinese Embassy with great enthusiasm and shook hands and embraced one by one with the staff.

These Sri Lankan friends believe that the success of China's new nuclear test is another victory for the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman of the Chinese people. The vice-chairman of the Sino-Sri Lanka Friendship Association, Sirivardhana, said: This successful nuclear test is "another heavy blow to the colluding imperialist United States and the modern revisionist Soviet Union that seek to monopolize nuclear weapons. It is a powerful support for the Vietnamese people in their struggle against the American aggressors."

Team member Samaranayaka said, "This is not only a new victory for the Chinese people, but also a new victory for the people of the whole world."

    战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一胜利
    锡兰朋友热烈欢呼中国核爆炸的新成就
    据新华社科伦坡二十九日电　最近从中国访问归来的锡中友好代表团全体成员，二十八日晚上听到中国又成功地进行了一次新的核爆炸的消息时，热情高呼：“中国人民万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“毛泽东主席万岁！”
    他们是在参加中国大使馆为他们举行的招待会上听到这个消息的。他们热情地向中国大使馆工作人员表示祝贺，并且一个接着一个同中国大使馆工作人员握手和拥抱。
    这些锡兰朋友认为，中国这次新的核爆炸成功是中国人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅和伟大舵手毛泽东主席的战无不胜的思想的又一胜利。锡中友好协会副主席西里瓦德纳说：这次核爆炸成功“是对狼狈为奸企图垄断核武器的美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的又一次沉重打击。这是对抗击美国侵略者的越南人民的强有力的支持。”
    代表团团员萨马拉纳亚克说，这不仅是中国人民的新胜利，也是全世界人民的新胜利。
