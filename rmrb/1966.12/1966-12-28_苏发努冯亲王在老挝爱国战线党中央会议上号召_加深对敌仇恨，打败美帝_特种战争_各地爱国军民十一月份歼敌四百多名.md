Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, called on all cadres and combatants to constantly enhance their patriotism and deepen their hatred towards the enemy, stressing the importance of political and ideological work within the troops, caring for the people's livelihood, strengthening unity, and defeating the "special warfare" waged by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

The meeting, which began on December 15 and was presided over by Prince Souphanouvong, adopted a statement condemning the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys against Laos. It also adopted a statement fully supporting the liberation struggle of the Vietnamese people and resolutely condemning the U.S. imperialist aggression against Vietnam.

According to broadcasts by the Pathet Lao radio station, Lao patriotic military and civilian forces in various regions launched extensive guerrilla warfare in November, repeatedly attacking the enemy, and dealt heavy blows to the ground assaults and aerial banditry of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, achieving significant victories.

In November, patriotic military and civilian forces in various regions of Laos engaged in more than 40 battles, annihilating over 400 enemy troops, shooting down four enemy aircraft, damaging several others, and seizing a large number of weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies.

The guerrilla warfare in Xieng Khouang Province has further developed, with a large number of young women joining the guerrilla units, and each village forming a women's guerrilla squad.

According to another broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station, on the 16th, the patriotic military and civilian forces in Sam Neua Province shot down and damaged one U.S. bandit aircraft each.
