    当英雄的越南人民和老挝人民的体育队伍走进体育场的时候，观众长时间地热烈鼓掌。越南和老挝的运动员们，在各项比赛当中充分地发扬了抗击美帝国主义的不屈不挠的战斗精神，赛出了风格，打出了水平。越南运动员在田径、游泳、射击三个项目当中共获得了三项冠军，还取得了二十二项亚军和第三名。

    他说：第一届亚洲新运会已经巩固了新兴力量人民之间的团结，加强了他们之间的友谊。我们必须通过树立榜样使全世界确信：只要团结起来，我们就一定能打败新老殖民主义和帝国主义。
    他说：我们意识到我们的力量和我们的团结，而且为了捍卫和保护我们的独立，我们准备作出任何牺牲。
    他说：车轮正在势不可当地向前转动，任何力量也不能阻挡朝着进步和光明前进的步伐。新运会的精神是完全符合这一发展趋势的。
    下午六时五十五分，西哈努克亲王宣布第一届亚洲新运会胜利闭幕。他祝愿运动员们在第二届亚洲新运会相遇。这时，第一届亚洲新运会会旗冉冉降下，运动会的火炬熄灭。会场上唱起了告别的歌曲。在依依惜别声中，东道主柬埔寨的运动员们跑向各国运动员的队伍里，同他们握手、拥抱，表达他们在这届亚洲新运会上结下的深厚友谊，并互相祝愿在第二届亚洲新运会上再见。与此同时，参加闭幕式的六万名金边市民，掏出各自携带的火柴，一支支点燃起来，全场顿时金光闪烁，象征着新兴力量人民体育事业发展的灿烂前景。
    闭幕式最后，夜空中升起了五彩缤纷的焰火。这是胜利的花朵，友谊的花朵，团结反帝的花朵。这时，各国选手在广场载歌载舞，看台上掌声雷动，欢呼不息。
