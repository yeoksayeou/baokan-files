The Little Red Book, though small, is filled with treasures. It guides us in revolution and construction.

	Wei Ge Guo
	Wrapped in snow and wind, my heart is joyful.
	Day and night, I face the cold wind and snow.
	With vigilance and gun in hand, I patrol.
	With a heart of loyalty and devotion, I protect our motherland.
	Wrapped in snow and wind, my heart is joyful.

	Zhang Feng
	My heart is warm and sweet.
	The fire warms my chest, but the wind chills my feet.
	I have settled in the snowy mountains,
	Standing guard against the wind.
	For the country and the people, my heart is warm and sweet.

	Fan Lianzhong
	On the snow-capped mountain, I have made my home.
	That mountain pierces the sky.
	The radar soldier stands on top.
	A red heart dedicated to the Party,
	On the snow-capped mountain, I have made my home.
	The machine hums, the antenna turns,
	Watching the changing skies.
	With my hands, I weave a net of heaven and earth,
	Swearing to let any flying foe come and never return!

	Chang Qing
	I dedicate my youth to the frontier.
	Living on the snowy mountain,
	I gaze out at the world.
	Armed with Mao Zedong Thought,
	I dedicate my youth to the frontier!

	Tian Guoyou
	The sentry post is the snow mountain.
	The sentry stands in the clouds.
	In height, it stands with the "Roof of the World";
	In vision, the whole globe is within sight.
	Raging winds, heavy snow, and lightning,
	Are like the flames of tempering;
	Hail, heavy rain, and thunder,
	Are like hammers tempering true gold;
	The scorching sun has peeled off several layers of skin,
	But it cannot erase the smile from the soldier's face.
	The sentry post is the snow mountain.
	The sentry stands in the clouds.
	A volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," a gun,
	A body of martial arts and courage,
	Thousands of difficulties are trampled underfoot,
	The revolutionary mission is dared to be undertaken.

	Sun Gang
	I wish to learn from Lei Feng.
	I wish to learn from Lei Feng,
	With a red heart, I read Chairman Mao's works.
	For the revolution, I study hard.
	I am a screw, tightened on the mountain top.
	I die for the revolution, I live for the revolution.
	The highland projectionist,
	With a pole on my shoulders and two legs,
	I can fly to the ends of the earth.
	Ice peaks and snowy mountains hang the screen,
	The biting wind blows, but I stand firm.
	Shouldering thousands of mountains and crossing ten thousand waters,
	In the wind and snow, I go back and forth.
	We are the propagators of Mao Zedong Thought,
	We will raise the red flag on the cultural front.

    高原战士诗抄毛主席语录语录本虽小，装的尽是宝，革命和建设，全靠他指导。
            魏葛国身披风雪心快活昼迎寒风夜伴雪，警惕握枪来巡逻，赤胆忠心为祖国，身披风雪心快活。
            张　丰我心暖又甜火烤胸前暖，风吹脚下寒，雪岭安下家，迎风把岗站，为国为人民，我心暖又甜。
            范连忠雪山顶上把家安错那山，刺破天，雷达战士立上边；一颗红心献给党，雪山顶上把家安。油机响，天线转，眼观长空风云变幻；双手织成天罗地网，誓叫飞贼有来无还！
            常　青青春献边疆身居雪山上，
  放眼世界望，毛泽东思想武装咱，誓把青春献边疆！
            田国友雪山哨兵哨所就是雪山，哨兵站在云端。比高——和“世界屋脊”并立；望远——全球装进眼帘。狂风、大雪、闪电，当作熔炼的火焰；冰雹、急雨、炸雷，似钢锤把真金锤炼；烈日晒落了几层皮，抹不掉战士脸上的笑
  颜。哨所就是雪山，哨兵站在云端。一部“毛选”一杆枪，一身武艺一身胆，千重困难脚下踩，革命重任敢承担。
            孙　戬我愿学雷锋我愿学雷锋，人红心也红，毛主席著作时时读，为了革命苦用功。做个螺丝钉，拧在雪山顶，死为革命死，生为革命生。高原放映员一根扁担两条腿，天涯海角任我飞，冰峰雪岭挂银幕，寒风凛冽任你吹。肩挑千山跨万水，风里雪里任来回，我们是毛泽东思想宣
    传员，要在文化战线上举红
    旗。
            孙　戬
