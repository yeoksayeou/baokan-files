Colonel Dun, Commander of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Armed Forces, Issues a Statement
Condemns U.S. Imperialism and Lao Rightists for Annexing Kong Le's Forces

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency from Kengtung on December 4: According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station on December 2, Colonel Dun, Commander of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Armed Forces, issued a statement on December 1 condemning U.S. imperialism and Lao rightists for annexing Kong Le's forces, accusing them of plotting to strengthen rightist forces.

Colonel Dun pointed out that U.S. imperialism and its Lao lackeys are annexing Kong Le's forces in an attempt to strengthen rightist forces. They plan to use Kong Le's bases as a springboard to launch attacks on the important strategic base of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Armed Forces and the Lao Patriotic Front in the Plain of Jars and Xieng Khoang region, thereby expanding the war in Laos.

Colonel Dun said that Prince Souphanouvong, driven by personal interests, has taken a path that brings disaster to the nation. He, under the orders of U.S. imperialism and Lao rightists, issued an order to merge Kong Le's forces into the rightist army and expelled Kong Le from the command of Kong Le's forces.

Colonel Dun appealed to all officers and soldiers who participated in the August 9, 1960 coup within Kong Le's forces to quickly awaken for the sake of the nation's interests, to oppose the merger with the rightist army, and to join the people and the patriotic neutralist forces.

    老挝爱国中立武装力量总指挥敦上校发表声明
    谴责美帝和老挝右派并吞贡勒军队
    据新华社康开四日电  据巴特寮电台二日广播：老挝爱国中立武装力量总指挥敦上校一日发表声明，谴责美帝国主义和老挝右派并吞贡勒军队，加强右派力量的阴谋。
    敦上校指出，美帝国主义及其老挝走狗并吞贡勒军队，企图借此加强右派力量，利用贡勒军队的基地，作为向爱国中立武装力量和老挝爱国战线党的重要战略根据地查尔平原—川圹地区发动进攻的跳板，以便扩大老挝战争。
    敦上校说，富马亲王出于个人利益，走上祸国殃民的道路。他奉美帝国主义和老挝右派的命令，下令把贡勒军队合并到右派军队中去，并且把贡勒从贡勒军队指挥部中排斥出去。
    敦上校呼吁贡勒军队中曾经参加一九六○年八月九日的政变的全体官兵，为了祖国的利益迅速觉醒，反对同右派军队合并，投向人民，投向爱国中立力量的队伍。
