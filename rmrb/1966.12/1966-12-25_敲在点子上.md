The entire company was buzzing with excitement. The recently returned demobilized soldier was immediately surrounded by his comrades, who asked about his well-being and shared heartfelt conversations. The members of the first platoon were especially joyful today. Their former platoon leader, Lu Shiren, who had been demobilized to the Inner Mongolia Geological Exploration Team, had also returned. After being apart for over two years, the comrades had missed him dearly! Now everyone was eager to shake his hand and greet him. Familiar old comrades reported on their studies and work over the past two years. New comrades who were not familiar introduced themselves and their enlistment dates. Just as they were chatting enthusiastically, the old platoon leader suddenly asked, "Where is Li Youchun?"

From the back of the crowd, Li Youchun replied, "I'm here!" Li Youchun pushed through the crowd to Lu Shiren and said, "Platoon Leader, how have you been?"

Lu Shiren replied, "I'm fine! And you?"

"I... I'm not doing too well," Li Youchun stammered.

"Why not?" Lu Shiren asked.

"This... this..." Before Li Youchun could finish, he turned and walked away. His actions surprised Lu Shiren, who quickly asked the others, "What's wrong with Li Youchun?"

Xiao Zhao from the platoon said, "He's been having trouble these past few days."

Lu Shiren asked, "What's the matter?"

The deputy platoon leader said, "What's the matter? You know his temper. As for work and study, Li Youchun has made a lot of progress these past two years. After you left, he joined the Communist Youth League. At the beginning of this year, he was also selected as a model soldier. It's just that his temperament is too stubborn. A few days ago, because someone from another platoon took his pliers, he was afraid they would be damaged and delay work, so he got into an argument. Afterward, the platoon comrades talked to him, and he quickly realized his mistake and regretted it. It seems that his thoughts are still in conflict."

After dinner, under the basketball hoop on the playground, two people were having a heart-to-heart talk—Lu Shiren and Li Youchun. The old platoon leader asked, "Li Youchun, what was wrong earlier?"

"I wanted to have a good talk with you," Li Youchun said.

"That's good! Go ahead," Lu Shiren replied.

Li Youchun looked at the old platoon leader and said, "Before you left, you had high expectations for me. You told me to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, advancing on the path of revolutionization. But I, over these two years, though I have made some progress, am still far from the Party's requirements. Especially my temper, I just can't control it, and it has a bad influence on my comrades."

The old platoon leader asked with concern, "Have you found the root cause?"

"I have. Every time I 'lose control,' I have reflected on it. But the alarm bell always rings, and the problem always arises," Lu Shiren said with a smile, "You still haven't hit the nail on the head."

"Where is the nail?" Li Youchun asked eagerly.

The old platoon leader pointed to his head and said, "Right here! The problem of temper cannot be solved just by controlling it. You should find the root cause in your thoughts and solve it according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Only then can it be fundamentally corrected." Li Youchun listened and felt that the old platoon leader's words hit the mark. He held Lu Shiren's hand and said, "Platoon Leader, please help me find it again!"

"That's good! Come, let's study Chairman Mao's teachings together," Lu Shiren said. Both took out their "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud together, "Dr. Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessness, his extreme dedication to his work, his extreme devotion to his comrades and the people..."

Li Youchun's heart became clearer and clearer, and his understanding of his own problems deepened. Finally, he said excitedly, "Platoon Leader! Now I understand. In the past, I did not demand much of myself, just satisfied with not making mistakes, and did not have the extreme devotion to comrades and the people like Dr. Norman Bethune. The root cause is: my thoughts have not been thoroughly transformed, and there is a 'self' in my mind."

The old platoon leader heard this and said happily, "Yes! The root cause is just that. Now that we've found it, we must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly uproot it!" Li Youchun said, "Platoon Leader, please rest assured. In the future, I will definitely study Chairman Mao's works more diligently and thoroughly transform my thoughts!"

Now the old platoon leader has left the company, but Li Youchun has never forgotten that heart-to-heart talk that night. He studies Chairman Mao's works more diligently, and no matter how busy or tired he is, he always finds time to study. At a class meeting, he said, "Only when the 'self' is completely uprooted can the 'public' be deeply rooted. Once a private thought is discovered, use Mao Zedong Thought, this powerful ideological weapon, to attack and break it. Only by continuously attacking can we accumulate small victories into big victories." Since Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instruction to push the study of Chairman Mao's works to a new stage was conveyed, Li Youchun's enthusiasm for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has grown even stronger. Now, he is advancing on the path of revolutionization with big strides!

    敲在点子上
    袁天柱
    全连都沸腾起来了。刚刚到连的复员战士，一下子被战友们围得风雨不透，问寒问暖，有着说不完的知心话。一班的同志们今天更是高兴。他们复员到内蒙古地质勘探队的老班长卢世荣，今天也回来了。离别两年多，同志们是多么想念他呀！现在大家都抢着和他握手问候。相识的老战友，纷纷向老班长汇报自己这两年学习和工作的情况。不相识的新战友也自报姓名和入伍年月。正谈得起劲，老班长忽然问道：“李有春哪去啦？”只听李有春在人群后面答道：“在这儿呢！”小李穿过人群走到卢世荣跟前说：“老班长，你好！”卢世荣说：“好啊！你呢？”“我？不太好！”“怎么不太好呢？”“这……这……”话没有说完，小李就转身走了。他这个举动使卢世荣很意外，忙问大家：“小李怎么啦？”班里的小赵说：“这两天他脑袋里又‘打架’了。”卢世荣问：“为了啥？”副班长说：“为啥？他那脾气你还不知道。要说工作和学习，小李这两年可进步不小。你走后，他入了团。今年初评又被评上五好战士。就是个性太犟。前两天因为别班的同志拿了他的钳子，他怕弄坏了耽误工作，就和人家吵起来了。事后班里的同志找他谈心，他很快认识到自己错了，很后悔。看来，现在思想还在斗争呢！”
    晚饭后，在操场篮球架的下边坐着俩人，在谈心，这就是卢世荣和李有春。老班长问：“小李，你刚才怎么啦？”“我想好好和你谈谈。”老班长说：“那好啊！你就说吧！”小李看看老班长说：“你临走时对我期望很大，要我读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，在革命化的道路上大步前进。可是我，这两年虽有些进步，但距离党的要求差得很远。尤其是我这毛脾气，总是克制不住，对同志们影响很不好。”老班长关心地问：“这个根子你找到了没有？”“找了。每次‘走火’我都找过。可警钟总敲，问题总出。”老班长笑道：“你呀，还是没敲到点上。”“没敲到点上？”“对！”李有春连忙问：“这个点在哪呢？”老班长指了指他脑袋说：“就在这啦！脾气问题不能只靠克制去改正，应该从思想里找出根源，按照毛主席的指示去解决，这才能彻底改正。”小李听了，觉得老班长的话说到根上啦，拉住卢世荣的手说：“老班长，你再帮我好好找找吧！”卢世荣说：“那好啊！来，咱们一起学习毛主席的教导。”说着两人都拿出《毛主席语录》同声读道：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。……”小李越学心越明，越学对自己的问题认识越清，最后激动地说：“老班长！现在我算认识到了，以前我对自己要求不高，只满足不出毛病，没像白求恩同志那样对同志对人民的极端的热忱。根子还是一个：思想改造不彻底，脑子里有个‘私’字。”老班长听了高兴地说：“对！根子就是这么一条。现在抓住了，一定要用毛泽东思想作武器，彻底地把它拔掉！”小李说：“老班长，请你放心，今后我一定更好地学习毛主席著作，认真地改造思想！”
    现在老班长已经离开了连队，但是李有春对那天晚上的谈心一刻也没忘掉。他学习毛主席著作更加勤奋了，每天无论工作多忙、多累，也要抽出时间学习，在班里的一次讲用会上，他说：“现在我才真正体会到，‘私’字拔得越净，‘公’字才能扎得越深。发现有一点私心，就用毛泽东思想这个强大的思想武器去攻破它。只有不断的攻，才能积小胜为大胜。”自从林彪副主席要全军把学习毛主席著作推向一个新阶段的指示传达后，李有春对学用毛主席著作的劲头更大了，现在，他正沿着革命化的道路大踏步的前进着！（附图片）
