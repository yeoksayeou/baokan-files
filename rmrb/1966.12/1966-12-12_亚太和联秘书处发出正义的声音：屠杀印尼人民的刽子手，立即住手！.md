The Secretariat of the Asia-Pacific Peace Committee today issued a letter of protest to Indonesian General Suharto. The letter states that one of the most horrifying crimes in world history is the massacre of the Indonesian people carried out by you, General Nasution, and your group of accomplices with the support of American imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries. We strongly protest against this unprecedented fascist atrocity.

The letter says that currently, 300,000 Indonesian patriots are still being held in prisons and concentration camps by you. They are still being persecuted, suffering from torture, disease, and starvation, and are on the brink of death. Your conspiracy to further massacre these 300,000 Indonesian patriots must be exposed and immediately stopped!

The letter points out that the Asia-Pacific Peace Committee firmly supports the recent emergency appeal issued by the Indonesian People's Solidarity Organization to save the 300,000 Indonesian patriots. The peace-loving and justice-seeking people of the Asia-Pacific region are watching your actions with anger.

Now is the time for you—the executioners of the Indonesian people—to realize that your actions and continued crimes will lead to your own downfall. You must understand that the true strength in Indonesia lies with the Indonesian people, not with you. Opposing the people will not end well for you.

The letter concludes by saying that the democratic forces of the world are advancing, and the people of the Asia-Pacific region are advancing. You must meet the just demands of the vast majority of the Indonesian people and immediately release the 300,000 Indonesian patriots. If you continue to ignore the opposition of the Indonesian people and the condemnation and protests of the international public, and continue to persecute Indonesian patriots, you will face broader and more intense resistance and condemnation from the Indonesian people and the peace-loving people of the world. You will not escape the judgment of history. Choose your path now.

    亚太和联秘书处发出正义的声音：屠杀印尼人民的刽子手，立即住手！
    新华社十一日讯　亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会秘书处今天发表给印度尼西亚苏哈托的抗议书，抗议书说，世界历史上最骇人听闻的罪行之一是你和纳苏蒂安将军以及你们一群合伙者在美帝国主义和印尼国内反动派支持下对印尼人民进行大屠杀所犯下的罪行。我们强烈抗议你们这种空前的法西斯暴行。
    抗议书说，目前三十万印尼爱国者仍被你们囚禁在监狱和死亡营中。他们仍在被迫害，遭受酷刑、疾病和饥饿的折磨而濒于死亡的危险中。你们阴谋进一步屠杀这三十万印尼爱国者的罪恶必须加以揭露并立即制止！
    抗议书指出，亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会坚决支持印尼亚非人民团结组织最近发表的为拯救三十万印尼爱国者紧急呼吁书的正义立场。亚洲及太平洋地区各国爱好和平和主持正义的人民正在愤怒地注视着你们的行动。
    现在是你们——屠杀印尼人民的刽子手，开始认识到你们的所作所为和继续干的勾当将使你们自食其果的时候了。你们要懂得，在印尼真正强大的力量是印尼人民，而不是你们。你们与人民为敌是不会有好下场的。
    抗议书最后说，世界民主力量在前进，亚洲及太平洋各国人民在前进，你们必须满足印尼广大人民的正义要求，立即给三十万印尼爱国者以自由。你们如继续无视印尼人民的反对，无视各国公众舆论的谴责和抗议，继续对印尼爱国者进行迫害，必将激起印尼人民和世界爱好和平人民的更广泛更剧烈的反抗和谴责，你们也将难逃历史的审判。何去何从，立即抉择。
