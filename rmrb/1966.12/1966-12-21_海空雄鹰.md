The Ministry of National Defense recently named the "Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment," a heroic combat collective that has emerged within the People's Liberation Army Navy Air Force.

For many years, the "Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment" has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In every battle, they have dared to fight and dared to win, demonstrating an unyielding heroic spirit. They have struck fear into the hearts of enemies in our country's skies and seas, achieving glorious victories and excellently completing the glorious tasks entrusted by the Party and the people.

Having us is having no enemies—this is the brave fighting spirit possessed by the great era of Mao Zedong, the great Chinese people, and the great People's Liberation Army. As Chairman Mao taught us, "This army possesses an indomitable spirit; it will trample down all enemies and never be subdued by any enemy." We must have this spirit of having us is having no enemies against imperialism. We must have this spirit against modern revisionism, reactionaries of all countries, and all ghosts and snakes. With this revolutionary backbone, any difficulty can be overcome, any miracle can be created, and any enemy can be defeated.

The "Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment" draws its fearless heroic spirit from the great Mao Zedong Thought. It is the great leader Chairman Mao who has given them a great revolutionary ideal, making all the officers and soldiers of the "Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment" understand that they must serve the Chinese people "completely" and "thoroughly," and also serve the people of the world "completely" and "thoroughly." This great revolutionary ideal and revolutionary aspiration make them fearless in the face of any enemy, not only daring to fight but also skilled in fighting, overcoming one difficulty after another, and achieving one victory after another.

Now, a new chapter has been added to the history of the Navy Air Force Regiment: the Ministry of National Defense has bestowed upon them the glorious title of "Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment."

In September 1949, Chairman Mao solemnly declared: "We will not only have a powerful army but also a powerful air force and a powerful navy." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, the "Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment" has focused on the revolutionary construction of the troops, resolutely executing the directive to "spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy." They have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, soaring through the skies and seas of our motherland, fighting bravely. No matter what enemy aircraft they encounter, whether from the Kuomintang bandits or American imperialism; whether the enemy aircraft come by day or night, high or low, they dare to fight and dare to engage, achieving victory in battle. Over the past decade, they have shot down and damaged more than 30 enemy aircraft. When analyzing the reasons for their victories, the pilots all deeply felt that "Mao Zedong Thought is the source of our strength and the fundamental guarantee of our victories."

Putting the Study and Application of Chairman Mao's Works First

Upon arriving at the "Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment," the first impression is that everyone loves Chairman Mao's works with boundless enthusiasm, studying them as if starving. Whether it is during combat duty, classes, meetings, or flight evaluations, studying tactics, they always start by learning Chairman Mao's quotations. On rest days, the pilots are not thinking about going out but are busy organizing their study notes, writing study bulletin boards, and sharing study experiences. In the summer of the south, when it is a good time to go out for a stroll after dinner, the pilots' dormitories are brightly lit, with everyone bent over their desks studying Chairman Mao's works.

The strong political atmosphere within the regiment was not naturally formed but was gradually developed through repeated struggles against purely military viewpoints. There was a period when, influenced by the bourgeois military line, some leaders only emphasized flying, technology, and "all-weather" operations, rarely focusing on political study. Some pilots, who had grown up in hardship, began to pay attention to their clothing and food.

The 1960 Military Commission Enlarged Meeting, presided over by Comrade Lin Biao, issued the great call to "definitely master Mao Zedong Thought." Following Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, they studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, launching the "Two Remembrances and Three Investigations" movement. Many pilots recalled their past miserable lives and denounced the oppression they suffered in the old society. Thinking about the old society that devoured people and looking at today's Party that has nurtured them into people's pilots, how could they not love the Party, love Chairman Mao, and love Chairman Mao's works from the bottom of their hearts?

Under the leadership of a group of active members, the entire regiment quickly formed a wave of studying Chairman Mao's works. However, the question of where to place the study of Chairman Mao's works had not been completely resolved at that time. At that time, there were still four days a week without "Daily Reading." Some pilots asked, "Why can we insist on daily training but not daily reading of Chairman Mao's works?" Someone replied, "Flight preparation and flight days cannot be used for other activities; this is the experience of many years of practice." Others cited relevant documents to support this view.

Is the study of Chairman Mao's works related to flying or not? What is the relationship between the two? To clarify this issue, they launched a debate among the pilots. At that time, many comrades pointed out: Mao Zedong Thought is our soul, and any work must be guided by Mao Zedong Thought, including flight training. Only by insisting on daily reading of Chairman Mao's works can we improve our consciousness and also improve our flying.

To convince everyone with facts, the political commissar personally went to the Third Squadron to conduct a point inspection. At that time, the Third Squadron was conducting a conversion training, and the theoretical flight course was a difficult point. The political commissar, in conjunction with the situation in Vietnam and the anti-American struggle, organized the pilots to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "The people who have already won revolutionary victories should aid the struggle of the people who are fighting for liberation; this is our internationalist duty," raising everyone's confidence and courage to learn flying for the world revolution. Later, they organized the pilots to study "On Contradiction," finding the main aspect of the main contradiction in flying. As a result, the pilots' spiritual outlook quickly changed, and the conversion training task was soon completed. From then on, during the flight period, not only was the time for "Daily Reading" increased, but "Daily Reading" was also placed in the first hour of every morning.

Selflessly Serving the People

With the position of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works established, the entire regiment's study movement quickly reached a new high. In the past, more attention was paid to the number of people, articles, and time spent studying; now, emphasis is placed on working hard on the "application." In the past, more emphasis was placed on "small guarantees"; now, emphasis is placed on transforming thoughts and achieving ideological revolutionization.

On the path of ideological revolutionization, the "Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment" repeatedly studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles," always following Chairman Mao's teachings to serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly," strictly demanding of themselves, and thoroughly breaking down selfishness. They deeply felt from their own practice of ideological transformation: to achieve "completely" and "thoroughly," one must serve the people with no selfishness, no conditions, and no cost!

The regiment is stationed on the coastal defense front, continuously shooting down enemy aircraft. Some pilots who have achieved victories and received awards feel envious of those who have not shot down any enemy aircraft, becoming anxious. During combat duty, because the first class takes off first and has more opportunities, some comrades only want to be in the first class and do not want to be in the second class. The regiment's leadership noticed these ideological tendencies and believed that this problem must be solved.

At this time, the First Squadron produced an advanced individual who was willing to be in the second class. His name is Wang Xiangyi. Since taking on combat duty, Wang Xiangyi has almost always been in the second class. At first, he also had some personal considerations. Later, he studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with this question in mind. When he read Chairman Mao's words about a person having "no trace of self-interest," he repeatedly pondered the two characters "no trace." He thought: In the past, he always felt that his active seeking of battle was good, and having a little self-interest was nothing. In fact, this was very wrong. Chairman Mao emphasized the two characters "no trace," which means we must eliminate even the slightest trace of self-interest! From then on, he strictly demanded of himself with "no trace of self-interest," always preparing diligently every time he was in the second class. In the scorching summer of the south, Wang Xiangyi sat in the furnace-like cockpit every day, guided by the thought of "not fighting for personal glory but protecting the country's airspace," wholeheartedly serving as the second class, waiting for the battle to take off. During one air battle, when the pilot of the first class's attack was ineffective, he quickly took off to engage in combat, damaging the enemy aircraft.

The First Squadron Party Branch publicized Wang Xiangyi's deeds and put forward a resounding slogan: Follow Chairman Mao's teachings and serve the people with no selfishness, no conditions, and no cost! The regiment's leadership also paid great attention to Wang Xiangyi's advanced thoughts, requiring every comrade in the entire regiment to use these three "no" as a measure to examine their thoughts and guide their actions.

To make every comrade in the regiment achieve serving the people with no selfishness, no conditions, and no cost, they also emphasized strengthening the regiment's class education, often organizing everyone to visit class education exhibitions, hold remembrance and bitterness meetings, visit poor villages, and listen to poor and lower-middle peasants tell village and family histories. Combining these living teaching materials, they deeply studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, and comrades' class consciousness quickly improved.

They also deeply felt: What kind of pilots are cultivated is completely different between the proletarian army and the bourgeois army. Pilots cultivated by the bourgeois army are superior individuals with personalism and survivalism in their minds; such pilots can only lose battles. Pilots cultivated by the proletariat are servants of the people, ordinary soldiers, with a great communist ideal; such pilots have high morale and are invincible. Therefore, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings, resisting the infiltration of bourgeois ideology in everything, starting from small things in daily life, and advancing towards the great goal of ideological revolutionization.

Deputy Commander Jia Chuanshun is a flight officer who lives with the pilots. One morning, he placed the thermos on the corridor, waiting for the clerk to fetch water, and then went to eat. After finishing the meal and returning, he found the thermos light. He thought: Fetching water is the clerk's job, so I should wait! Thus, he returned to the dormitory, flipping through Chairman Mao's works while waiting for water. He read "In Service of the People" and immediately realized that his previous thought was wrong: Fetching water is indeed the clerk's responsibility, but when I go to the canteen to eat, can't I bring back hot water with me? Waiting for others to serve me is not serving others! He thought again: Chairman Mao said, "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people." To be a good servant, one must first work hard on the "diligence." Laziness is the breakthrough point for the infiltration of bourgeois ideology. Thinking of this, he immediately went to fetch the water himself. From then on, he did this every day. It seems like a small matter, but Deputy Commander Jia Chuanshun drew an important conclusion from it. He said: "We should rush to serve others and not wait for others to serve us!"

The cadres are like this, and the pilots are also like this. In the past, pilots had clerks to serve them. Now, many things are done by the pilots themselves. Cleaning the toilet is a dirty job, but everyone rushes to do it. When stationed in a certain place, the National People's Congress representative and combat hero Shu Jicheng voluntarily took care of the toilet for more than a month, sweeping it small every day and big once a week, keeping it clean. Someone asked him why he did this? He said: This is Chairman Mao's teaching; people's representatives should better serve the people.

In the past, pilots had to go into the city to get a haircut. Now, they cut each other's hair. They said: Cutting their own hair can save time, not affect combat readiness, and maintain the appearance of laboring people! In their spare time, many comrades also engage in various kinds of labor, such as making brooms, repairing tables and chairs, and cleaning up. They said: "The state has given us good treatment, and we have no right to use this happy life and good treatment as capital to pamper ourselves and show off. We do more things ourselves to resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, ensuring that we never forget our roots and never change color!"

Not Forgetting the Needs of the World Revolution

The regiment's leadership educates the troops to not only serve the Chinese people "completely" and "thoroughly" but also to serve the people of the world "completely" and "thoroughly." Combat hero Shu Jicheng wrote in his notes on studying Chairman Mao's works: "Before the world revolution is successful, even if we shoot down a hundred or a thousand enemy aircraft, we cannot relax for a moment!" Gao Xiang said well: "Every time we shoot down an American aircraft here, there is one less American aircraft over the heads of the Vietnamese people, and one less American aircraft over the heads of the oppressed people of the world!"

Guided by the thought of serving the people of the entire world "completely" and "thoroughly," the comrades of the "Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment" conscientiously do every combat readiness task. They are not afraid of hardship and are not afraid of fatigue, trampling difficulties under their feet. Pilots on combat duty often get up before dawn, facing the stars to the airfield, and return to the barracks when the sun sets. Ground crew members work day and night to maintain the aircraft. They said: "Every time we check each part and wipe each screw, we are serving the people of the world, so what hardship and fatigue are there to speak of." According to regulations, the aircraft needs to be checked after flying for a certain period. They, to prevent any malfunctions from taking to the sky, check the compressor blades after each takeoff and landing. Mechanic Wang Tianzheng is tall and heavy; every time he crawls into the intake, he must have an empty stomach to get in. Sometimes, when he crawls out of the intake, he is so hungry that his vision blurs, but he said: "To serve the Chinese people and the people of the world 'completely' and 'thoroughly,' even if I am tired and hungry, I am willing."

Pilots armed with Mao Zedong Thought do not forget the needs of the world revolution, despising American imperialism and all reactionaries. Every time they take to the skies for combat, they are fearless and dare to "fight to the death."

One morning, the Second Squadron was on duty at the airfield. That day, they selected and studied a passage from Chairman Mao: "In front of wild beasts, one must not show the slightest cowardice. We must learn from Wu Song on Mount Hua." Everyone read and discussed. Gao Xiang, sitting on the bed, listened to everyone's speeches and thought: "Chairman Mao compares the enemy to wild beasts, which is very apt. Look, the United States was defeated in Korea and then invaded Vietnam; it was defeated in Vietnam and still wants to expand the war crazily." Thinking of this, he said angrily: "When dealing with wild beasts, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and fight to the death."

It was almost noon when the battle alarm suddenly rang. Gao Xiang and Huang Fengsheng, driving their eagles, shot straight into the sky like two beams of light. Guided by the navigator, they quickly discovered the enemy from the left front window. Gao Xiang thought: "Today, I must use the spirit of Wu Song fighting the tiger to eat this beast!" Just then, the enemy aircraft suddenly made a right turn, and Gao Xiang bravely "cut" in, just at the effective shooting distance. He was about to open fire when Mao Zedong's teaching about "injuring ten fingers is not as good as cutting off one finger" flashed in his mind. Closer, even closer! The enemy aircraft's shadow quickly filled the sight. Gao Xiang gritted his teeth, thinking: "First, I'll take you down, even if I collide, I am heavier than Mount Tai!" Then came a long burst of fire. The bullets pierced the enemy aircraft. Gao Xiang pulled up to disengage, seeing a thick smoke from below the fuselage, the American "brand-name" F-104 fighter, in front of the "Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment's" tiger-fighting heroes, completely turned into pieces.

Pilots with a global revolutionary spirit are never satisfied with victory. They said: "To realize the world revolution, we must start with winning one battle after another." In the process of executing combat missions, they seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on knowing the enemy and oneself, being invincible in a hundred battles, using our strengths to strike the enemy's weaknesses, seriously investigate and study, analyze the enemy situation, find countermeasures, and fight according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

In December 1964, the First Squadron was ordered to shoot down the American-made Chiang Kai-shek RF-101 aircraft. The pilot of the first aircraft, Wang Hongxi, was very happy but did not want to sit down and study the enemy situation and tactics. He thought: I have shot down F-86s, and "101" is nothing special; at that time, I can even ram it down.

The next day, during the tactical study, Wang Hongxi expressed his thoughts. The leadership affirmed his courage to fight and dare to win, but also seriously pointed out: Chairman Mao teaches us that in combat, we must be brave and also have strategy, daring to fight and also skilled in fighting, not relying solely on old experience.

The tactical study heated up. Commanders, pilots, navigators, and staff sat together, presenting situations, discussing problems, and finding solutions. They started by studying the general performance of the enemy aircraft, its usual routes, altitudes, speeds, and so on. Chairman Mao said, in studying the laws of war, "If you do not understand its specific laws, you cannot guide the revolutionary war, you cannot win in the revolutionary war." They started from studying the general performance and activity characteristics of the enemy aircraft, further studying the laws of combat. In a later battle, they took off to intercept the enemy according to the combat plan they had studied, and immediately shot down the enemy aircraft.

The victories in air combat followed one after another. Pilots with a global revolutionary spirit are never satisfied with victory. Comrades said well: "We are making a world revolution, and in our lifetime, we must defeat imperialism until it is in tatters, and create a new world of communism!"

    海空雄鹰
    编者按：国防部最近命名的“海空雄鹰团”，是人民解放军海军航空兵部队中涌现出来的英雄战斗集体。
    多年来，“海空雄鹰团”高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在历次战斗中，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，表现了有我无敌的英雄气概。威震祖国海空，取得辉煌战绩，出色地完成了党和人民交给的光荣任务。
    有我无敌，这是伟大毛泽东时代、伟大中国人民和伟大中国人民解放军所具有的英勇战斗精神。正如毛主席所教导我们的：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”我们对帝国主义，要有我无敌，对现代修正主义、各国反动派和一切牛鬼蛇神，都要有我无敌。有了这种革命硬骨头精神，任何困难都能克服，任何奇迹都能创造，任何敌人都不在话下。
    “海空雄鹰团”这种大无畏英雄气概，来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。是伟大领袖毛主席赋予他们以远大的革命理想，使“海空雄鹰团”的全体指战员们懂得，不仅要“完全”“彻底”地为中国人民服务，而且要“完全”“彻底”地为世界人民服务。这种远大的革命理想和革命抱负，使他们在任何敌人面前都无所畏惧，不但敢于斗争，而且善于斗争，战胜了一个又一个的困难，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    现在，海军航空兵某团的团史上增添了新的一页：国防部授予他们以“海空雄鹰团”的光荣称号。
    一九四九年九月，毛主席庄严宣告：“我们将不但有一个强大的陆军，而且有一个强大的空军和一个强大的海军。”“海空雄鹰团”遵照毛主席的教导，狠抓部队的革命化建设，坚决执行了“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”的指示。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，纵横祖国海空，英勇作战。不论碰上什么敌机，蒋介石匪帮的也好，美帝国主义的也好；不管敌机是白天来，晚上来，高空来，低空来，他们都敢打敢拚，战而胜之。十多年来，他们共击落击伤敌机三十多架。当分析胜利原因时，飞行员们都深有体会地说：“毛泽东思想是我们力量的源泉，是打胜仗的根本保证。”
    把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位
    来到“海空雄鹰团”，头一个印象，就是人人无限热爱毛主席著作，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。不论是战斗值班，上课开会，还是飞行讲评，研究战术，他们都要先学毛主席语录。休息天，飞行员们不是想着上街，而是忙着整理学习笔记，写学习墙报，交流学习经验。南方的夏天，晚饭之后本是出外乘凉的好时候，可是，飞行员宿舍里却是灯光通明，一个个伏在案头学习毛主席著作。
    团里这样浓厚的政治空气，并不是自然形成的，而是在和单纯军事观点的反复斗争中逐步发展起来的。曾经有个时期，由于受到了资产阶级军事路线的影响，有的领导只讲飞行，只讲技术，只讲“全天候”，很少抓政治学习。有些飞行员，本是苦水里长大，却开始讲究起吃穿来了。
    由林彪同志亲自主持的一九六○年军委扩大会议，发出了“一定要把毛泽东思想学到手”的伟大号召。他们按照林彪同志的指示，学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，开展了两忆三查运动。许多飞行员都回忆了过去的悲惨生活，控诉在旧社会所遭受的压迫。他们想想吃人的旧社会，看看今天党把自己培养成为一个人民的飞行员，怎能不从心底里热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱毛主席著作呢！
    在一批积极分子带动下，全团学习毛主席著作很快形成热潮。但是，学习毛主席著作应该放在什么位置，当时并没有完全解决。那时候，每周还有四天没有安排“天天读”。有的飞行员提出疑问说：“为什么能坚持天天练，却不能坚持天天读毛主席著作？”有人却回答说：“飞行准备和飞行日不能做其他事情，这是多年实践的经验。”还有人搬出有关文件来论证这种观点。
    学习毛主席著作和飞行有关还是无关？两者到底是什么关系？为了弄清这个问题，他们发动飞行员展开了一场辩论。当时，许多同志都指出：毛泽东思想是我们的灵魂，任何工作都要用毛泽东思想去统帅，飞行训练也不能例外。只有坚持天天读毛主席著作，才能提高觉悟，也才能搞好飞行。
    为了用事实说服大家，部队政委又亲自到三大队去蹲点。当时，三大队正在搞改装训练，飞行理论课是个难点。政委就结合援越抗美形势，组织飞行员学习毛主席的教导“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务”，提高了大家为世界革命学飞行的信心和勇气。后来，还组织飞行员学习《矛盾论》，找出了飞行当中的主要矛盾的主要方面。结果，飞行员们的精神面貌迅速改变，改装训练任务很快就完成了。从此，飞行期间不但增加了“天天读”的时间，还把“天天读”放在了每天上午的第一个小时。
        毫无私心地为人民服务
    活学活用毛主席著作定了位，全团的学习运动很快就出现了一个新的高潮。过去比较注意学习的人数、篇数和时间多少，现在强调在“用”字上狠下功夫。过去抓“小保证”多，现在强调改造思想，实现思想革命化。
    在思想革命化大道上迈进的“海空雄鹰团”，反复学习“老三篇”，时时遵照毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，严格要求，大破私心。他们从自己思想改造的实践中深刻地体会到：要做到“完全”“彻底”，就必须毫无私心、毫无条件、毫无代价地为人民服务！
    部队守卫在海防前线，连续击落敌机。有的飞行员立了功受了奖，没有击落过敌机的飞行员，看了就有些羡慕，着急。战斗值班时，因为一号班先起飞，战机多，有的同志就只想当一号班，不愿当二号班。团领导上觉察到这些思想苗头，认为这个问题必须解决。
      这时候，一大队出现了一个“甘当二号班”的先进人物。他叫王相一。王相一自担任战斗值班以来，差不多都是二号班。开始，他也有些个人考虑。后来，他带着这个问题学习了《纪念白求恩》。当他读到毛主席说一个人要有“毫无自私自利之心”时，就反复琢磨“毫无”两个字。他想：过去总觉得自己积极求战是好的，自私自利之心有一点没啥。其实这是很错误的。毛主席强调“毫无”两个字，就是要求我们对自私自利之心，有一丝就要铲除一丝，有一毫就要铲除一毫！从这以后，他以“毫无自私自利之心”严格要求自己，每次值二号班，都兢兢业业地做好准备。南方的炎夏，王相一每天坐在火笼一般的机舱里，在“不为个人争战功，只为祖国保领空”的思想指导下，全心全意地当二号班，等候着战斗起飞。一次空战中，当担任一号班的飞行员攻击没有奏效时，他便迅速升空作战，把敌机击伤。
    一大队党支部宣扬了王相一的事迹，提出了一个响亮的口号：按照毛主席的教导，毫无私心、毫无条件、毫无代价地为人民服务！团领导上也极为重视王相一的先进思想，要求全团每个同志都以这三个“毫无”为尺度，来检查思想，指导行动。
    为了使全团同志做到毫无私心、毫无条件、毫无代价地为人民服务，他们还重视加强部队的阶级教育，经常组织大家参观阶级教育展览会，开忆苦思甜会，到农村访贫问苦，听贫下中农讲村史家史。结合这些耳闻目睹的活教材，深入学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，同志们的阶级觉悟提高得很快。
    他们还深深体会到：培养什么样的飞行员，无产阶级军队和资产阶级军队的做法是截然不同的。资产阶级军队培养的飞行员，是高人一等的特殊人物，满脑袋个人主义、活命思想，这样的飞行员只能打败仗。无产阶级培养的飞行员，是人民的勤务员，是普通一兵，有远大的共产主义理想，这样的飞行员斗志昂扬，战无不胜。因此，他们按照毛主席的教导，人人、处处抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀，从日常生活的小事情做起，向思想革命化的大目标迈进。
    副团长贾传顺是个飞行干部，和飞行员住在一起。一天早晨，他把热水瓶放在走廊上，等公务员拿去打水，自己就吃饭去了。吃完饭回来，一提热水瓶，轻轻的。他想：打开水是公务员的事，自己还是等着吧！于是，他回到宿舍，一边等水喝，一边翻开了毛主席著作。他读了《为人民服务》，立即意识到刚才的想法不对头：打水固然是公务员的职责，可是，自己去食堂吃饭，不是随手就能带回开水来吗？只等着别人来侍候，不就是等着别人来为我服务吗？他又想：毛主席说，“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”。要当好这个勤务员，首先就得在“勤”字上下功夫。而懒惰，正是资产阶级思想侵蚀的突破口。想到这里，他马上自己去打开水了。以后他天天都这样做。看起来，这是一件小事，可是，贾传顺副团长却从中得出了一个重要的结论。他说：“要抢着为别人服务，不要等着别人为我服务！”
    干部们是这样，飞行员们也是这样。以前，飞行员都有公务员服务。现在，许多事都是飞行员自己干了。打扫厕所是个脏活，可是大家都抢着干。在驻守某地时，全国人大代表、战斗英雄舒积成自动管厕所一个多月，每天一小扫，每周一大扫，搞得干干净净。有人问他为什么要这样做？他说：这是毛主席教导的，人民代表就要更好地为人民当勤务员。
    以前，飞行员理发，都要进城。现在呢，都是飞行员、机械员自己互相理。他们说：自己理发可以节省时间，不影响战备，还能保持劳动人民的本色！在课余时间里，还有许多同志从事各种各样的劳动，例如扎扫把，修桌凳，打扫卫生等等。他们说：“国家给了我们优厚的待遇，我们没有权利把这种幸福生活和优厚待遇，当成养娇气、摆阔气的资本。我们自己动手多做些事情，正是为了抵制资产阶级思想的侵袭，保证自己永远不忘本，永远不变色！”
          不忘世界革命的需要
    团的领导教育部队，不仅要“完全”“彻底”地为中国人民服务，而且要“完全”“彻底”地为世界人民服务。战斗英雄舒积成在学习毛主席著作的笔记里这样写道：“世界革命没有成功以前，就是再打下一百架一千架敌机，也不能松一口气！”高翔说得好：“我们在这里打下一架美国飞机，越南人民头上就少一架美国飞机，全世界被压迫人民头上就少一架美国飞机！”
      “海空雄鹰团”的同志们，在“完全”“彻底”为全世界人民服务的思想指导下，认真做好每一项战备工作。他们不怕苦，不怕累，把困难踩在脚下。飞行员战斗值班，常常是天不亮就起来，顶着星星上机场，太阳下山回营房。地勤人员夜以继日地为搞好飞机维护工作而辛勤操劳。他们说：“我们想到检修每一部机件，擦拭每一个螺丝，都是为世界人民服务，就什么苦什么累都不在话下了。”按照规定，飞机飞了一段时间之后，才需要爬进进气道去检查压缩机叶片的状况。他们为了预防万一，不带故障上天，每飞完一个起落，就爬一次进气道。机械员王天增身高体胖，他每次爬进进气道，必须空着肚子才能爬进去。有时，当他爬出进气道时，就饿得眼前发黑，可是，他说：“为了‘完全’‘彻底’地为中国人民和世界人民服务，就是再累再饿，我也心甘情愿。”
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的飞行员，不忘世界革命的需要，蔑视美帝国主义和一切反动派。他们每次升空作战，都是有我无敌，敢于“刺刀见红”。
    一天上午，二大队在机场值班。这天，他们选学了毛主席的这样一段话：“在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦。我们要学景阳冈上的武松。”大家边读边议。坐在床上的高翔，一边听大家发言，一边想：“毛主席把敌人比做野兽，比得真好。你看，美国在朝鲜打败了，又去侵略越南；在越南打了败仗，还要疯狂扩大战争。”想到这里，他满腔愤怒地说：“我们对付野兽，就要按毛主席的指示去办，往死里打。”
    快到中午了，战斗警铃突然响起来。高翔和黄凤生驾驶着他们的雄鹰，像两道白光，直射云霄。他们在领航员引导下，很快就从左前窗里发现了敌人。高翔心里说：“今天一定要用武松打虎的劲头，把这只野兽吃掉！”正在这时，敌机忽然来了个右转弯，高翔勇敢地“切”过去，正好是有效射击距离。他正想开炮，脑子里忽然闪出毛主席关于“伤其十指不如断其一指”的教导。近些，再近些！敌机的身影迅速塞满了光环。高翔咬紧牙关，心想：“先干掉你再说，撞上了我也重于泰山！”接着就是一个长连射。炮弹直穿敌机。高翔拉起脱离，只见一团浓烟从机身下面擦过，美国“名牌货”F—104战斗机，在“海空雄鹰团”的打虎英雄面前，完全化为碎片了。
    胸怀世界革命的飞行员，在胜利面前，永远不会满足。他们说：“实现世界革命，必须从打好一个又一个胜仗做起。”他们在执行战斗任务过程中，认真学习毛主席关于知彼知己，百战不殆、扬我之长，击敌之短的教导，认真调查研究，分析敌情，找出对策，按照毛主席的指示去打仗。
    一九六四年十二月，一大队奉命打美制蒋机RF—101。一号机飞行员王鸿喜高兴极了，可就是不愿意坐下来研究敌情，研究打法。他想：我打过F—86，“101”也没什么了不起，到时候，撞也能把它撞下来。
    第二天研究战术，王鸿喜谈出了自己的想法。领导上肯定了他敢打敢上的勇气，同时也严肃地指出：毛主席教导我们，作战要勇，也要有谋，既要敢于斗争，还要善于斗争，不能只靠老经验。
    战术研究热烈展开了。指挥员、飞行员、领航员、参谋，大家坐在一起，出情况，摆问题，想办法。开始只研究敌机的一般性能，惯用的航线、高度、速度等等。毛主席说，在研究战争规律问题时，“不懂得它的特殊的规律，就不能指导革命战争，就不能在革命战争中打胜仗”。他们从研究敌机的一般性能、活动特点开始，进一步研究了作战的规律。后来的一次作战中，他们按着研究好的作战预案升空迎敌，便一举将敌机击落。
    空战的胜利，一个接着一个。胸怀世界革命的飞行员，在胜利面前，永远不会满足。同志们说得好：“我们是闹世界革命的，我们这一辈子一定要把帝国主义打得落花流水，打出一个共产主义的新世界来！”
