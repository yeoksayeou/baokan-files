	Mao Zedong said: "Beginning with the intention to harm others, ending with harming oneself. This will be the inevitable outcome of all reactionary policies."

	BEIJING, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) — The right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia, led by Nasution, have recently instigated larger-scale anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities in Sumatra. They continue to collectively expel overseas Chinese from their places of residence and forcibly impose so-called "assimilation" on them, a form of racial persecution. Since October, the number of overseas Chinese forced to leave their homes and gather in Medan has increased by more than 3,000.

	Nasution, the right-wing military leader who rose to power with the support of U.S. imperialism, returned to his old base in Medan on November 14 and conducted activities in Sumatra for ten days, further plotting anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-Chinese activities. This was precisely when the Chinese ship Guanghua was docked at Belawan Bay in Medan, waiting to receive overseas Chinese. After Nasution arrived in Sumatra, his henchmen became active, issuing orders and urging their subordinates to "make new achievements in solving the overseas Chinese problem," making Sumatra a "model region" for anti-Chinese activities. On November 15, a spokesman for the North Sumatra Military Region openly declared: "The current fundamental goal is to drive away all dangerous Chinese nationals and then assimilate those who are not dangerous." Nasution's confidant, Major General Sobiran, the commander of the Second Military Region, told Western news agency reporters on the 14th that to further expand anti-Chinese activities, he said: "The behavior and actions of overseas Chinese have always hurt the feelings of the Indonesian people. The sooner they run back to their homeland, the better." To support this new wave of anti-Chinese madness, one of Nasution's key henchmen, Chairman of the Indonesian "Central Institution for National Unity Education" Sendunada, also rushed from Jakarta to Medan and incited reactionary military personnel and representatives of "Kami" and "Kabri" thugs at the Christian Club, saying: "The central government has considered three issues regarding Chinese Communist overseas Chinese: first, mass slaughter; second, mass expulsion; third, assimilation."

	The right-wing reactionary authorities in Sumatra, in order to plunder the property of overseas Chinese, have again dug up the old "Presidential Decree No. 10" from the 1959 anti-Chinese activities, which had already failed due to opposition from the Indonesian people, and banned overseas Chinese from operating retail businesses in small towns and villages. The commander of the Second Military Region, Sobiran, ordered the re-implementation of this decree, and the governor of North Sumatra specially convened a meeting to pick up this piece of junk and instructed the village heads to "strictly implement Decree No. 10."

	After these right-wing reactionary leaders took these series of actions, new waves of anti-Chinese activities have surged in many places in Sumatra. In mid-November, a meeting of right-wing thug organizations "Kami" and "Kabri" was held in Medan, deciding to drive out all overseas Chinese in North Sumatra. The "Kami" and "Kabri" thugs also proposed not to recognize the nationality of Chinese descendants who became Indonesian citizens after 1961, and to expel these Chinese descendants out of the country.

	The day after Nasution left Sumatra, a large-scale attack on overseas Chinese by thugs occurred in Medan, with many overseas Chinese being robbed and beaten. The right-wing authorities and thugs in Minahasa, Denpasar, Simpang, Merauke, Yili, Melong, Sigli, and Rukun colluded to implement the so-called "assimilation" policy, going so far as to not allow citizens of the People's Republic of China to speak Chinese, using fascist terror to deal with Chinese overseas Chinese who speak Chinese. Many overseas Chinese were beaten and insulted by police and thugs for speaking Chinese in public places. Simpang also had incidents of forcibly marrying Chinese women to Indonesians.

	After many small towns implemented the anti-Chinese "Presidential Decree No. 10," a large number of overseas Chinese workers became unemployed, and small traders were ruined.

	Currently, the new wave of anti-Chinese activities is further expanding. The reactionary military government in Riau Province, the "Two People's Orders War-time Power," ordered the registration of all overseas Chinese property and banned overseas Chinese from selling or transferring their legal property. They also organized something called the "Chinese Supervision Group" to intensify the persecution of overseas Chinese.

    疯狂叫嚣要屠杀、驱逐和“同化”华侨
    印尼反动派正策动新的反华浪潮
    纳苏蒂安去苏门答腊地区亲自指挥大规模迫害我侨胞
    毛主席说：“以损人的目的开始，以害己的结果告终。这将是一切反动政策的发展规律。”
    新华社六日电　以纳苏蒂安为首的印度尼西亚右派反动势力，最近在苏门答腊策动了更大规模的反华排华活动。他们继续集体驱赶华侨离开侨居地，同时对华侨强迫进行所谓“同化”的种族主义迫害。自十月份以来，被迫离开侨居地到棉兰集中的受害华侨又增加了三千多人。
    由美帝国主义豢养发迹的右派将领头目纳苏蒂安，于十一月十四日又回到他的老巢棉兰，在苏门答腊地区进行了为期十天的活动，进一步策划反共反人民和反华排华的罪恶勾当。这正是中国接侨船光华轮停泊在棉兰勿拉湾港等待接侨的时候。纳苏蒂安到达苏门答腊地区以后，他的爪牙纷纷活动起来，加紧发号施令，督促他们的下属，要在“解决华侨问题方面做出新的成绩”，使苏门答腊成为反华排华的“模范地区”。十一月十五日，苏北军区陆军发言人公开叫嚣说：“目前的根本目标是赶走所有的有危险性的中国籍人士，然后对没有危险性的中国人进行同化。”纳苏蒂安的亲信、第二军区司令索比兰准将于十四日向西方通讯社的记者发表谈话，为进一步扩大反华排华制造借口说：“华侨的举止和行动，都一直伤害着印尼民众的感情。华侨越快跑回他们的祖国就越好。”为了配合这次新的反华排华疯狂活动，纳苏蒂安的得力爪牙印尼“中央民族统一培育机构”主席沈杜纳达，也专程由雅加达赶到棉兰，在基督教俱乐部向反动军人和“卡比”、“卡米”暴徒的代表鼓动说：“中央已考虑到三项有关中共侨民的问题：一、采取大屠杀；二、大量驱逐；三、进行同化。”
    苏门答腊右派政权当局为了掠夺华侨的财产，又从一九五九年反华排华的旧“法令”中，翻出因为受到印尼人民反对而早已破产的所谓“总统第十号法令”，不准华侨在小城镇和乡村经营零售商业。第二军区司令索比兰下令要重新实施这项法令，苏北省长又专门召开了会议，拾起这个破烂货色，训令各乡乡长“坚决实行十号法令”。
    这些右派反动头目作了这一系列策动之后，苏门答腊许多地方又掀起了新的反华排华浪潮。十一月中旬，棉兰市召开了全苏北的右派暴徒组织“卡米”、“卡比”会员大会，决定要将全苏北地区的华侨集中驱赶。“卡米”、“卡比”暴徒又提出不承认一九六一年以后加入印尼国籍的华裔的国籍，也要把这些华裔赶出境。
    在纳苏蒂安离开苏门答腊的第二天，棉兰市就发生暴徒大规模袭击华侨的血腥事件，许多华侨被抢劫和殴打。民礼、丁宜、司马委、美拉务、怡里、美伦、西吉利、鹿树昆等市镇的右派当局和暴徒勾结起来，实施所谓“同化”政策，竟然猖狂到不准中华人民共和国的侨民讲华语，采取法西斯恐怖的手段来对付讲华语的中国侨民。有许多华侨因为在公共场所讲了华语，被警察和暴徒殴打、辱骂。司马委还发生了强迫华侨妇女嫁给印尼人的事件。
    有许多小市镇实施了反华排华的“总统第十号法令”后，使大量的华侨职工无以为生，小商小贩倾家荡产。
    目前，新掀起的反华排华浪潮正在进一步扩大。廖内省的反动军人政权当局“两项人民命令战时掌权处”，下令将所有的华侨财产进行登记，不许华侨将自己的合法财产出卖和转让。他们还组织什么“监督支那人小组”，加紧对华侨进行迫害。
