Platoon Leader Zhang Shuibei of a certain unit in the Beijing Military Region accepted the task of receiving Red Guards. He specially prepared a set of tools for mending shoes. He thought to himself: The Red Guard youngsters have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call, walking to Beijing for a tour, and surely many of them have broken shoes. Helping them mend their shoes is also something I should do for the guests Chairman Mao has invited.

As soon as Zhang Shuibei arrived at the reception station, he conducted a "reconnaissance" and found that many Red Guards' shoes were broken. After the Red Guards went to sleep, he started working, first picking out a few pairs of the most badly broken shoes, mending what needed mending and patching what needed patching.

One night, he found a pair of white leather shoes with a big hole in them. He only had black and blue cloth on hand, and patching with those would not match the color, but he couldn't find any white cloth. What to do? He found a piece of white cloth from his own clothes and patched the white leather shoes. The Red Guard comrade who wore the shoes Zhang Shuibei had mended was very moved.

In the first seven days Zhang Shuibei was at the reception station, he only slept for a total of 21 hours to mend shoes for the Red Guards. Sometimes he was really tired, and if he wasn't careful, the awl would pierce his hand. He didn't mind these things at all. The biggest difficulty was that many of the shoes were rubber-soled, and when the needle was inserted, he had to bite it through with his teeth. Once, while mending a pair of shoes, because they had been worn for a long time and not washed, the smell was very strong. When his nose got close to the shoes, he had some reservations. He thought to himself: So many Red Guards are watching me, won't they say that this soldier of liberation doesn't care about hygiene? As soon as this thought appeared, he immediately recalled Chairman Mao's teachings: Serving the people must be thorough and complete, without any selfishness. Thinking of this, he continued to mend the shoes.

The Red Guards were moved by Zhang Shuibei's spirit of serving the people and all said they wanted to learn from the PLA's hardworking and simple style. Many Red Guards, seeing that their shoes were broken, would borrow needles and thread from Zhang Shuibei to mend them themselves, asking his name while doing so. Zhang Shuibei would always smile and say: "I am a serviceman."

    “我叫勤务员”
    北京部队某部排长张水贝接受了接待红卫兵的任务后，特地准备了一套钉鞋的工具。他心里想：红卫兵小将们积极响应毛主席的号召，步行串连，来到北京，一定有很多人的鞋子破了，帮助他们修修，也算我给毛主席请来的客人做了一件应该做的事情。
    张水贝一到接待站，先进行了一次“侦察”，发现许多红卫兵的鞋子破了。张水贝等红卫兵睡觉以后，就动起手来，先挑几双破得最厉害的鞋子，该钉的钉，该补的补。
    有天晚上，他发现有一双白色力士鞋破了很大一个洞，自己手里只有黑布和蓝布，补上去颜色不合，但又找不到白布。怎么办呢？他从自己身上找了一块白布，把那双白球鞋补好了。那位红卫兵战士穿上张水贝给他补好的鞋，心里很激动。
    张水贝刚到接待站的头七天，为了给红卫兵补鞋，加起来才睡了二十一个小时的觉。有时候确实很困了，一不小心锥子就把手扎破，这些他都不在乎。最大的困难是很多都是胶鞋，把针扎到里面，用牙齿咬才能穿过去。有一次补一双鞋，因为穿的时间长了，又没有洗，气味很大。他的鼻子一挨近鞋子，思想就有些顾虑。他心里想：那么多红卫兵都看着我，不说我这个解放军不讲卫生吗？这个念头一出现，他马上想起毛主席的教导，为人民服务必须完全彻底，不能有半点私心。想到这里，他就继续修下去。
    红卫兵们被张水贝这种为人民服务的精神所感动，都说要学习解放军艰苦朴素的作风。有很多红卫兵看到自己的鞋子破了，就到张水贝那里借来针和线自己补，边补边打听张水贝叫什么名子。张水贝总是笑呵呵地说：“我叫勤务员。”
