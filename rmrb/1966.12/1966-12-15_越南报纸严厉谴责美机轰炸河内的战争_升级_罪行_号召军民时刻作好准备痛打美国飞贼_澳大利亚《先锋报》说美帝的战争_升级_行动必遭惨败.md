Hanoi newspapers on December 14th unanimously published editorials, severely condemning the U.S. bandit planes' savage bombing of the Hanoi city area on the 13th as a serious war "escalation" crime. They also called on the military and civilians of North Vietnam to resolutely carry out Chairman Ho Chi Minh's battle call, overcome all difficulties and hardships, make every sacrifice, and decisively defeat the U.S. aggressors, pushing the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to complete victory.

The editorial of the *People's Daily* said that the U.S. bandits' bombing of Hanoi on the 13th is a highly serious war "escalation" action against North Vietnam.

The editorial said, the U.S. bandits' brazen bombing of Vietnam's sacred capital Hanoi has further deepened the Vietnamese people's implacable hatred towards U.S. imperialism. The Vietnamese people resolutely demand that U.S. imperialism pay with blood for the blood debt it owes.

The editorial pointed out, the U.S. imperialists' frenzied attacks on Hanoi are the desperate actions of a beast cornered. The U.S. bandits foolishly think that by bombing the capital Hanoi, they can reverse their heavy losses in the South and shake the Vietnamese people's resolve to fight to the end. This is foolish.

The editorial called on all military and civilians to maintain high alert, be prepared at all times, and give the U.S. air bandits a resounding defeat. It also called on them to resolutely carry the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end.

The editorial of the *People's Army Daily* pointed out, the U.S. imperialists' heinous war expansion actions have further exposed their extremely reactionary face to the people of the world, leading to unprecedented isolation.

The editorial said, all military and civilians of Vietnam will follow Chairman Ho's teachings, fear no sacrifice, and resolutely fight, pushing the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to complete victory. The *Hanoi Capital Daily* and the *New Vietnam Chinese Daily* also published editorials condemning the U.S. bandits' savage bombing of the Hanoi city area.

Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, December 14th: The Australian *Vanguard* on December 14th published an article strongly protesting against U.S. imperialism's savage bombing of the Hanoi residential areas.

The article pointed out, the U.S. imperialists' bombing of densely populated residential areas in Hanoi is another heinous crime they have committed against the Vietnamese people. This crime has pushed the U.S. imperialists' dirty war of aggression in Vietnam to a new stage.

The article said, the U.S. imperialists took this new action because they suffered heavy defeats in South Vietnam. The article said: "Due to the continuous growth of the people's liberation armed forces, the U.S. imperialists cannot gain the initiative in South Vietnam. ... The puppet army, which was once the pillar of U.S. aggression in South Vietnam, has already collapsed, and the U.S. imperialist army will suffer the same fate."

The article pointed out: "The U.S. imperialists are desperately trying to strengthen their military forces and maintain morale, but this is impossible. The more troops they send, the more miserable their defeat will be. The U.S. imperialists try to intimidate the Vietnamese people with large-scale bombing and the use of other terror weapons. The result is exactly the opposite of their intentions."

    越南报纸严厉谴责美机轰炸河内的战争“升级”罪行
    号召军民时刻作好准备痛打美国飞贼
    澳大利亚《先锋报》说美帝的战争“升级”行动必遭惨败
    新华社河内十四日电河内各报十四日纷纷发表社论，严厉谴责美国强盗飞机十三日再次野蛮轰炸河内市区的严重战争“升级”罪行，并且号召越南北方军民坚决实现胡志明主席的战斗号召，克服一切艰难困苦，不惜一切牺牲，决心战胜美国侵略强盗，把抗美救国斗争推向完全胜利。
    《人民报》的社论说，美国强盗十三日再次轰炸河内市，是它对越南北方的极其严重的战争“升级”行动。
    社论说，美国强盗明目张胆地轰炸越南神圣的首都河内的罪行，进一步加深了越南人民对美帝国主义的不共戴天的仇恨。越南人民坚决要美帝国主义用血来偿还它欠下的这笔血债。
    社论指出，美帝国主义疯狂袭击河内市，是它陷入穷途末路的野兽般的绝望行动。美国强盗妄想通过对首都河内市的狂轰滥炸，来挽救他们在南方的惨重败局，动摇越南人民的决战决胜意志。这是愚蠢的。
    社论号召全体军民保持高度警惕，时刻作好准备，痛打美国飞贼，并且下定决心把抗美救国斗争进行到底。
    《人民军队报》的社论指出，美帝国主义罪恶滔天的扩大战争的行动，使它在世界人民面前更加暴露了它的极其反动的面目，遭到空前的孤立。
    社论说，越南全体军民将遵循胡主席的教导，不怕牺牲，坚决战斗，把抗美救国事业推向彻底的胜利。《首都河内报》和《新越华报》也发表社论，谴责美国强盗飞机野蛮轰炸河内市区的滔天罪行。
    新华社墨尔本十四日电　澳大利亚《先锋报》十四日发表文章，强烈抗议美帝国主义对河内居民区进行野蛮轰炸。
    文章指出，美帝国主义轰炸河内人口稠密的居民区，是它对越南人民犯下的又一新的滔天罪行。这一罪行使得美帝国主义进行的肮脏的侵越战争“升级”到了一个新阶段。
    文章说，美帝国主义采取这一新的行动，是因为他们在越南南方遭受了惨重的失败。文章说：“由于人民解放武装力量不断壮大，美帝国主义在越南南方不能取得主动。……曾经是美国侵略南越的支柱的伪军已经土崩瓦解了，美帝国主义的军队也将遭受同样的命运。”
    文章指出：“美帝国主义拚命地企图增强它的军力和保持士气，但这是办不到的事。增兵越多，败得也就越惨。美帝国主义企图用大规模的轰炸和使用其他恐怖武器来吓唬越南人民。其结果又恰恰与他们的打算相反。”
