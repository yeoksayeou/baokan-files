Upon entering Shashiyu, one sees that on both sides of the mountain path, on the stone slabs, stone stools, and stone walls by the road, Chairman Mao's quotations are written everywhere in bright, eye-catching letters. Here it says, "Make up your mind, don't be afraid of sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory." There it says, "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." ... Many community members wear exquisite Chairman Mao quotation badges on their chests and carry red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their pockets. Young men and women sing songs composed from Chairman Mao's quotations everywhere. The cadres and community members of Shashiyu are constantly being educated by Mao Zedong Thought through Chairman Mao's quotations.

Shashiyu Brigade of Yugezhuang People's Commune in Xuanhua County, Hebei Province, is renowned as the "Modern-Day Yu Gong" of the collective. However, the people of Shashiyu do not rest on their laurels. They study Chairman Mao's quotations, and the more they study, the broader their horizons become, the higher their thoughts rise, and the more vigorous their spirits are.

Old poor peasant Li Shushan originally thought that since his children had all grown up and could work, he could reduce his own workload. After studying "Quotations from Chairman Mao," he felt that his thoughts did not align with Chairman Mao's teachings. He started getting up early and going to bed late to participate in labor that he could handle, and often used the spirit of "selflessly serving the people" from Norman Bethune to measure himself. Recently, when the brigade was building terraces, he voluntarily brought his family's hoes, shovels, and baskets to the construction site for everyone to use every day.

Chairman Mao said, "We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficulties there are, the more we should go there, that is what a good comrade should do." Many young people memorize this quotation and put it into action. This spring, when the old livestock keeper fell ill and could no longer work, Chen Yuzhen, the daughter of a poor peasant, volunteered to take over the job of feeding the large livestock. In Shashiyu, women have never fed large livestock before. After Chen Yuzhen became a livestock keeper, some people said unpleasant things, and Chen Yuzhen felt very sad, thinking it would be better to do field work. However, she thought of "We work and struggle to solve difficulties," and dismissed the wrong thoughts, persevering and working with her comrades to raise the large livestock to be fat and healthy.

Eighteen-year-old Li Fengzhong was once known as the "troublemaker" of the entire brigade. He often caused a fuss over half a work point or a few minutes less rest. After studying Chairman Mao's quotations such as "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, working thoroughly for the people's interests" and "selflessly serving the people," he examined his own thoughts. From then on, he eagerly took on heavy work and became known as the "iron man" of the entire brigade.

Some young community members also exchange Chairman Mao's quotations to address different shortcomings and problems. Recently, a young man complained about the cold while repairing a demonstration field. Sixteen-year-old girls Li Xiuhua and Li Jinxiu read him Chairman Mao's quotation: "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." After studying this passage, the young man became more enthusiastic in his work.

### 毛主席语录时刻鼓舞着沙石峪人

    毛主席语录时刻鼓舞着沙石峪人
    一踏进沙石峪，只见山路两旁高耸的石崖上，路边的石板上、石墩上、石墙上，到处都写着鲜明耀眼的毛主席语录。这里是：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”那里是：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。……”不少社员胸前佩挂着精致的毛主席语录章，怀中揣着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》本，男女青年们到处大唱用毛主席语录谱成的歌。沙石峪的干部和社员，每时每刻都在从毛主席语录中受着毛泽东思想的教育。
    河北省遵化县岳各庄公社沙石峪大队，被誉为集体的“当代活愚公”，但是沙石峪人并没有在荣誉面前自满。他们通过大学毛主席语录，越学眼界越开阔，越学思想越提高，越学干劲越充沛。
    老贫农李述山，原来认为儿女们都长大成人，能劳动了，自己少干点活也可以过去了。学习了《毛主席语录》，他感到自己的想法不符合毛主席的教导，就起早睡晚参加力所能及的劳动，并经常以白求恩的“毫不利己专门利人”的精神，来衡量自己。最近队里在修梯田，他每天主动地把自己家里的镐、锹、筐等工具送到工地，给大家用。
    毛主席说：“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”许多青年把这条语录记在心上，用在行动上。今年春天，当老饲养员因病不能再做饲养工作时，贫农女儿陈玉珍就自告奋勇担任了大牲畜饲养员。在沙石峪，妇女历来是不喂大牲口的。陈玉珍当上饲养员以后，有人说些难听的话，陈玉珍听了心里很难过，想还是去干地里的活好。但是她想到
  “我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的”，就打消了错误的想法，坚持干下去，和同伴一起把大牲口喂得膘肥体壮。
    十八岁的李凤忠，过去是全大队出名的“调皮鬼”，往往因为少半个工分或者少休息几分钟，就吵闹一通。他学习了“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的”和
  “毫不利己专门利人”等毛主席语录后，对照检查了自己的思想。从此，他争着干重活，成为全大队出名的“铁汉子”。
    一些青年社员还针对不同的缺点和问题，互赠毛主席语录。最近，有一个青年在整修一块样板田时，怕冷，说了一些怪话。李秀华和李金霞这两个十六岁的姑娘，便给他读了毛主席语录：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”这个青年学习了这段话后，干活积极起来。
