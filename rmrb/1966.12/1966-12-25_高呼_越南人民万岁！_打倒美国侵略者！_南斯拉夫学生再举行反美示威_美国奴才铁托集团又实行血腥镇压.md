Students in Yugoslavia shout "Long Live the Vietnamese People! Down with American Aggressors!" Yugoslavian students stage another anti-American demonstration. The Tito clique, which serves as American lackeys, carries out bloody suppression.

	BEIJING, Dec. 24 (Xinhua) -- Following the suppression of anti-American demonstrations by students and teachers in the cities of Zagreb on Dec. 20, students in Belgrade held another anti-American demonstration on Dec. 23, which was also suppressed. This once again exposed the despicable face of the Tito clique as American lackeys.

	According to reports, on Dec. 23, students at the University of Belgrade held a rally in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle at the university's Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. Scientists, cultural workers, and social figures also participated in the meeting. Students at the meeting shouted slogans such as "Long Live the Vietnamese People!" and "Down with American Aggressors!"

	After the meeting, groups of students marched towards the nearby American reading room. However, as the students exited the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics building, they were stopped by police sent by the Tito clique, leading to a confrontation. Some students managed to reach the front of the American reading room. To protect their American masters, the Tito clique dispatched mounted police to blockade the American reading room. Students shouted slogans such as "Oppose the Vietnam War! We demand freedom for the Vietnamese people!" as they advanced towards the blockade. Police used water cannons and tear gas to suppress the students, injuring several and sending two to the emergency room. An assistant at the Institute of Social Sciences was also injured. Another group of demonstrators rushed towards the American Embassy and held a demonstration there, but they were also dispersed by the police.

	The anti-American demonstrations held by Yugoslavian students and the masses in recent days show that the Yugoslavian people are increasingly angry about American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and the Tito clique's role as American imperialism's lackeys. The Tito clique's brutal suppression can only add fuel to the fire of the Yugoslavian people's struggle.

    高呼“越南人民万岁！”“打倒美国侵略者！”
    南斯拉夫学生再举行反美示威
    美国奴才铁托集团又实行血腥镇压
    新华社二十四日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：继二十日萨格勒布市大、中学校师生反美示威遭到铁托叛徒集团镇压之后，二十三日贝尔格莱德大学生举行反美示威又遭镇压，这就再一次暴露了铁托叛徒集团充当美国奴才的可鄙嘴脸。
    据报道，二十三日贝尔格莱德大学学生在贝尔格莱德大学的自然科学数学系举行声援越南人民斗争大会。科学、文化工作者和社会名流也参加了这次集会。会上学生们高呼口号：“越南人民万岁！”“打倒美国侵略者！”
    会后，一批又一批的学生向邻近的美国阅览室进发。但是，当学生们走出自然科学数学系大楼时，就受到铁托叛徒集团派去的警察的阻拦，学生们同警察发生了冲突。有些学生绕道到达了美国阅览室前面。铁托叛徒集团为了保护它的美国主子的安全，出动骑警封锁了美国阅览室。学生们一面高呼“反对越南战争！我们要求给越南人民自由！”口号，一面向封锁线前进。警察使用水龙和催泪弹镇压学生，使几个学生受伤、两个学生被送到了急救站。社会科学研究所的一个助教也受了伤。另一批示威者又冲向美国大使馆，并在这里举行了示威游行，但他们也被警察驱散。
    南斯拉夫学生和群众连日来举行的反美示威表明，南斯拉夫人民对美帝国主义侵略越南和铁托叛徒集团充当美帝国主义的走卒，日益感到愤怒，铁托叛徒集团的残暴镇压，只能使南斯拉夫人民的斗争火上加油。（附图片）
