Macao patriots continue to rally, resolved to fight for the realization of our demands. Do not allow the Portuguese authorities in Macao to be cunning and deceitful, using excuses to delay. We warn the Portuguese authorities in Macao that they must immediately and fully realize our demands, otherwise they will be responsible for all serious consequences.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on the 24th, more than 100 representatives from various circles in Macao held a rally on the evening of the 22nd. They strongly condemned the Portuguese authorities in Macao for adopting a cunning, deceitful, and delaying attitude towards the just demands of the Macao people. They decided to unite and persist in their struggle, demanding that the Portuguese authorities in Macao immediately and completely fulfill the four conditions proposed by the Director of the Guangdong Provincial Foreign Affairs Office and the six demands of the Macao people.

The meeting heard a report on the situation of 13 representatives who met with the Portuguese "Governor" Cabral on the 20th. The representatives present unanimously expressed great anger at the dishonest attitude of the Portuguese authorities. They said that when the 13 representatives met with the Portuguese "Governor" Cabral, they returned the "written reply" from the Portuguese authorities on the spot, and it was right to return it. The Portuguese authorities must provide a new written reply according to the demands of the Macao people.

The representatives, in their speeches, expressed heartfelt thanks to the people of the motherland and the Red Guards for their firm support of the just struggle of the Macao people and their angry denunciation of the fascist atrocities of the Portuguese authorities.

The representatives solemnly declared that under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, with the strong support of the people and Red Guards of the motherland, the Macao people are full of confidence in victory. All patriotic people in Macao must heighten their vigilance, strengthen unity, and persist in the struggle. They will not rest until they achieve complete victory!

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on the 23rd, patriotic people from various circles in Macao have continued to hold anti-persecution struggle meetings in recent days. They angrily denounced the Portuguese authorities in Macao for still delaying and evading the just demands of our side and the Macao people, using a two-faced approach. They warned the Portuguese authorities: all our just demands must be immediately and fully realized without any compromise; they must immediately seal off the Kuomintang spy organization and expel the Kuomintang spies. Otherwise, the Portuguese authorities will be fully responsible for all serious consequences.

The workers, peasants, and students participating in the struggle meetings were full of vigor and high morale. They read Chairman Mao's quotations over and over again at various meetings: "Resolutely decide to do it, be unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

The patriotic people of Macao pointed out that the Portuguese authorities were forced to announce that they "fully accept" the just demands of our country and the Macao people, but in action, they have not fully and thoroughly implemented them. They have also released three main culprits and have not responded to the immediate confession and signing of the confession statement. The patriotic people of Macao declared: they must follow Chairman Mao's words, not believe the "good words" of imperialism, not be afraid of imperialist threats, and resolutely fight to the end.

More than 300 medical staff and employees of the Kam Lung Hospital held an anti-persecution struggle meeting on the evening of the 21st. They unanimously condemned the Portuguese authorities for their long-standing protection and indulgence of Kuomintang spies smuggling weapons and drugs, causing trouble and sabotage, and seriously endangering the safety of the Macao people. A nurse, with her personal experience, denounced the heinous crimes of American and Kuomintang spies. She said that in July 1962, she boarded the Macau-Hong Kong ferry to Guangzhou. The mad American and Kuomintang spies hid a time bomb in the toilet of the ship, intending to blow up all the passengers on the ship, but it was discovered in time by our public security personnel. The American and Kuomintang spies were caught before they could escape.

The patriotic people of Macao pointed out that the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. The Macao people have the strong support of the broad masses of people and the Red Guards in socialist motherland, fearing nothing, and will resolutely fight to the end, not resting until they achieve complete victory.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Guangzhou, more than 500 representatives from various circles in Zhuhai County held a memorial service on the 17th in the Zhuhai area near Macao for the three martyrs who were killed by the Portuguese authorities in Macao and buried in Zhuhai County. More than 200 family members of the martyrs from Macao and representatives from various circles in Macao attended the memorial service.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong, a delegation from the cultural circles of Hong Kong and Kowloon, including Fei Yimin, arrived in Macao on the 20th to visit and learn from the heroic Macao people who are persistently fighting against persecution. They were warmly welcomed by the people from various circles in Macao.

    代表们在发言中，对祖国人民和红卫兵坚决支持澳门同胞的正义斗争，愤怒声讨澳葡当局的法西斯暴行，表示衷心感谢。

    澳门爱国同胞指出，澳葡当局被迫宣布“全部接受”我国和澳门同胞的正义要求，但在行动上还没有全部彻底地付诸实现。他们还先后放走了三名主凶，并且对立即当面认罪及签署认罪书，都没有作出答复。澳门爱国同胞表示：一定要听毛主席的话，不相信帝国主义的“好话”，不害怕帝国主义的恐吓，坚决斗争到底。
