When the heroic overseas Chinese youth saw Zhou Enlai and the other comrades, they waved their red and shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao," jumping and shouting enthusiastically: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" Zhou Enlai and the other comrades shook hands with them warmly, expressing their greetings. The overseas Chinese youth heroes were moved to tears, repeatedly shouting: "Greetings to Chairman Mao! Greetings to Chairman Mao!" At this moment, they sang "The East Is Red" together with Zhou Enlai and the other comrades, expressing their boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao.
