	New Spirit, New Style

	Sincere Friendship

	On November 30, under the clear skies of Phnom Penh, Chinese cyclist Liu Yumin and Lebanese athlete Wawicks competed in the men's 200-meter sprint. Initially, Liu Yumin and Wawicks rode side by side. In the final sprint, Liu Yumin made a sudden dash into the inner lane, crossing the finish line first.

	At this point, Liu Yumin was already sweating profusely, but he did not stop to rest. Instead, he rode slowly around the track, waiting for Wawicks to reach his side. Then, he took Wawicks' hand, and they rode together around the track. The audience erupted in enthusiastic applause, praising the genuine friendship shown by the athletes from the two countries.

		We Are Brothers

	One day, the Chinese football team was in an intense match against the Palestinian football team. A Chinese player was accidentally injured by a Palestinian player. This small incident made the Palestinian friends feel sad. After the match, the Palestinian team captain immediately came down from the stands to meet the injured Chinese player. When informed that the injured player was receiving treatment, he expressed his wish to visit him and sincerely said, "I wish him a speedy recovery." He also said, "We are brothers, and our friendship is eternal."

		Snow in Winter

	Chinese badminton players practiced with athletes from various countries before the competition, exchanging experiences. Once, a Sri Lankan female badminton player, Nilanti, broke her racket strings before the match and was very anxious. The Chinese athletes immediately gave her the strings they had prepared to repair their own rackets. Nilanti was very touched and said, "Your skills are world-class, and your character is even more excellent." (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    真挚的友情
    十一月三十日，金边万里晴空，中国自行车运动员刘玉民和黎巴嫩选手瓦维克斯冒着热带的骄阳举行男子二百米争先赛。起先，刘玉民和瓦维克斯一直并车驰行。最后争先的时刻到了，只见刘玉民一个猛冲插入内圈，抢先到达终点。
    刘玉民这时已经汗流浃背，但他没有马上停下车来休息，却在跑道上缓缓地驰行，等瓦维克斯到达他的身边时，他便拉着瓦维克斯的手，一同并车绕场一周。这时，全场观众响起热烈的掌声，赞扬两国运动员表现的真挚友情。
        我们是兄弟
    有一天，中国足球队和巴勒斯坦足球队正在进行激烈的比赛，一名中国运动员被巴勒斯坦运动员无意踢伤。这件小事却使巴勒斯坦朋友感到难过。比赛结束后，巴勒斯坦领队立刻从看台上走下来，向中国队表示要求会见受伤的中国运动员。当中国队负责人告知他受伤的运动员正在治疗时，他表示希望能看望他，并恳切地说：“我祝他很快恢复健康。”他还说：“我们是兄弟，我们的情谊是永恒的。”
          雪里送炭
    中国羽毛球运动员在比赛前和各国运动员在一起练习球技，交流经验。有一次锡兰女子羽毛球选手尼兰蒂在赛前把拍弦打断了，她非常着急。中国运动员马上把准备用来修理自己球拍的弦线给尼兰蒂换上了。尼兰蒂很感动地说：“你们的技术是世界第一流的，而品德更是优秀的。”　（据新华社讯）
