	Guangdong Province Foreign Affairs Office Director Notifies Portuguese Authorities in Macau to Immediately Fully Implement Our Conditions and Demands

	Portuguese Authorities in Macau Forced to Hand Over Seven Kuomintang Spies to China Within Specified Deadline

	Chinese People Watching Portuguese Authorities' Future Moves, Will Not Allow Them to Delay or Evade

	New China News Agency Guangzhou, December 21st - On the 19th, the Director of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee Foreign Affairs Office commissioned the manager of the South China Trading Company in Macau, Ke Zhengping, to notify the Portuguese "Governor" of Macau, Jia Lebi, regarding the handling of the serious incident of the Portuguese authorities' brutal massacre and persecution of Chinese residents in Macau:

	1. Must immediately fully implement the four conditions stated in the declaration made by the Director of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee Foreign Affairs Office on December 9th, and the six demands proposed by representatives of various sectors of the Chinese community in Macau on December 10th;

	2. Must send representatives within 72 hours, bringing specific plans to implement the four conditions, to negotiate with representatives of the Guangdong Foreign Affairs Office;

	3. Must hand over the seven Kuomintang spies, along with relevant documents, that were seized by the Portuguese authorities when they intruded into Chinese waters in June 1963, to the designated personnel of the Guangdong Foreign Affairs Office within 48 hours.

	New China News Agency, December 21st - According to one of the conditions proposed in the declaration by the Director of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee Foreign Affairs Office on December 9th: "The seven Kuomintang spies seized by the Portuguese authorities in Macau when they intruded into Chinese waters in June 1963 must be immediately handed over to the Chinese government for handling," the Portuguese authorities in Macau were forced to hand over these seven Kuomintang spies to China within the deadline specified by the Director of the Guangdong Foreign Affairs Office (before midnight on December 20th). This is an initial victory achieved through the indignant denunciation by the broad masses of the Chinese people and the Red Guards, as well as the resolute struggle by patriotic compatriots in Macau. However, the Portuguese authorities in Macau must fully and thoroughly implement the four conditions proposed in the declaration by the Director of the Guangdong Foreign Affairs Office. We will not allow the Portuguese authorities to be cunning, evasive, or delay under any pretext. The Chinese people are closely watching the future moves of the Portuguese authorities.

    立即完全实现我方条件和要求
    澳葡当局已被迫在指定限期内将七名蒋匪特务交还我国
    中国人民注视澳葡当局今后动向，决不容许它耍赖拖延
    新华社广州二十一日电　广东省人民委员会外事处处长于十九日委托澳门南光贸易公司经理柯正平，就处理澳葡当局残暴屠杀和迫害澳门中国居民的严重事件，通知澳门葡萄牙“总督”嘉乐庇：
    一、必须立即完全实现十二月九日广东省人委外事处处长奉命所发表声明的四项条件和澳门中国居民各界代表十二月十日所提出的六项要求；
    二、限于七十二小时内派出代表并携带实现四项条件的具体方案前来同广东外事处的代表会谈；
    三、限于四十八小时内将其在一九六三年六月侵入中国水域抢走的七名蒋匪特务和有关他们的档案材料一并交广东外事处指定人员接收。
    新华社二十一日讯　根据十二月九日广东省人民委员会外事处处长声明中所提出的条件之一：“把一九六三年六月澳门葡萄牙当局侵入中国水域抢走的七名蒋匪特务立即交还中国政府处理”，澳门葡萄牙当局已被迫于广东外事处处长指定的限期内（十二月二十日凌晨）将这七名蒋匪特务交还我国。这是我国广大人民和红卫兵的愤怒声讨以及澳门爱国同胞的坚决斗争所取得的初步胜利。但是，澳葡当局必须全部彻底实现广东外事处处长声明中提出的四项条件，决不容许澳葡当局狡猾耍赖和借故拖延。对澳葡当局的今后动向，中国人民正密切注视中。
