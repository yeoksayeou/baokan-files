According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Damascus, a book titled "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China" was recently published in Arabic in the Syrian capital, Damascus. The book enthusiastically praises the great significance of China's Cultural Revolution and the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards.

The author of the book is Syrian journalist and secretary of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, Abdul Rahman Abu Kous. In the preface, the author states: "The Cultural Revolution in China is a great historical event for all socialists in the world. It is unprecedented in history."

The author refutes the slanderous rumors spread by imperialists through various propaganda means about the Cultural Revolution in China. He says: "I stayed in China for nine months and witnessed the beginning of the Cultural Revolution there. Therefore, I believe that in this matter, I have more authority to speak than those who write news from afar."

When talking about the Red Guards in China, the author writes: The Red Guards are a group of students and teachers who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and have a high level of consciousness. They voluntarily study and enthusiastically carry out Mao Zedong Thought. "The Red Guards are a new phenomenon in the cultural revolution, appearing for the first time in history, their task is to defend the fruits of the revolution and oppose the internal enemies." The author praises the Red Guards, saying, "They bravely and resolutely oppose the authorities who take the capitalist road and all the monsters and fiends who sabotage the cultural revolution, and fight against them." The actions of the Red Guards have proven the role of revolutionary youth and their ability to defend socialist construction. They are the successors of the revolution.

The author says: Different classes have different views on the Red Guards. Reactionaries, imperialists, and enemies of socialism say that the Red Guards are a group of fanatical youth who violate human dignity. "In fact, everything the Red Guards do is to carry out revolutionary principles, engage in ideological struggle, deeply criticize and expose the ugly faces of counter-revolutionaries, and expose the enemy's behavior to the people. The Red Guards exhibit the things these villains stole from the people, including even dollars and currency given by Chiang Kai-shek to his running dogs." The author says, the great actions of the Red Guards are not to humiliate human dignity, but to defend human dignity from being invaded by the enemy.

    保卫革命成果　横扫牛鬼蛇神
    亚非记协书记指出红卫兵是毛泽东思想武装的革命接班人
    据新华社大马士革电最近在叙利亚首都大马士革出版一本阿拉伯文的题为《中国文化大革命》的书，热情赞扬中国文化大革命的伟大意义和红卫兵的革命行动。
    这本书的作者是叙利亚新闻工作者、亚非新闻工作者协会书记处书记阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·阿布库斯。作者在书的前言中说：“中国的文化大革命对全世界的社会主义者来说是一件伟大的历史事件，它是史无前例的。”
    作者驳斥了帝国主义以各种宣传手段向世界散布的污蔑中国文化大革命的谰言。他说：“我在中国呆了九个月，在那里度过了文化大革命的开始阶段，因此，我认为在这个问题上，我比那些在万里之外写消息的人有更多的发言权”。
    作者在谈到中国的红卫兵时写道：红卫兵是一群用毛泽东思想武装起来的有觉悟的学生和教师，他们自觉学习和热情执行毛泽东思想。“红卫兵是文化革命中的新事物，是历史上第一次出现的，其任务是保卫革命成果，反对内部敌人。”作者赞扬红卫兵说，“他们坚决勇敢地反对走资本主义道路的当权派和一切破坏文化革命的牛鬼蛇神，并与之斗争。”红卫兵的行动证明了革命青年的作用及其保卫社会主义建设的能力。他们是革命的接班人。
    作者说：不同阶级对红卫兵有不同的观点，反动派、帝国主义和社会主义的敌人说红卫兵是一群狂热的青年，他们侵犯了人的尊严。“事实上，红卫兵所做的一切都是执行革命的原则，进行意识形态上的斗争，深刻地批判和揭露反革命的丑恶面目，把敌人的行为暴露在人民面前，红卫兵把这些蠢贼偷去的东西拿到人民面前展览，其中甚至有美元、有蒋介石给他的走狗的钞票。”作者说，红卫兵的这种伟大行动，不是侮辱人的尊严，而是保卫人的尊严，不受敌人侵犯。
