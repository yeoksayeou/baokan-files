This year, the agricultural front has seen the emergence of a new situation of great strategic significance: whether in the southern regions where rice is the main crop or in the northern regions where dry crops are the main crop, there has been a universal increase in production; the increase in the northern regions is significantly greater than in the southern regions. A considerable number of prefectures and counties that have long been unable to be self-sufficient in grain have now achieved self-sufficiency or basic self-sufficiency, and some have even achieved surplus production. This shows that dry crops can indeed achieve high yields, and the historical pattern of "southern grain to the north" can indeed be changed.

Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: The broad masses of peasants and rural cadres across the country have been continuously arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly studying Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. In the struggle to develop grain production this year, they have again achieved great new achievements. The total grain production and yield per unit area across the country have both increased significantly compared to last year, which was a good harvest year, making it the largest harvest since liberation seventeen years ago. This new achievement was made under the condition of relatively severe natural disasters. It once again vividly and powerfully proves that those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not only the most powerful combat force but also the most powerful productive force.

A prominent feature of China's grain production this year is that whether in the southern regions where rice is the main crop or in the northern regions where dry crops are the main crop, there has been a universal increase in production compared to last year; among them, the increase in the northern regions is significantly greater than in the southern regions. In the entire northern region, a considerable number of prefectures and counties that have long been unable to be self-sufficient in grain have achieved self-sufficiency or basic self-sufficiency due to the large-scale and significant increase in grain production this year, and some have even achieved surplus production. This convincingly shows that dry crops, which have long been in a state of low yield, can indeed achieve high yields; the historical pattern of "southern grain to the north" can indeed be changed. The new situation that has emerged in China's grain production, which has great strategic significance, shows that China's grain production has a very broad prospect for development. We should be more confident and strive forward towards a beautiful future.

This year, various natural disasters have occurred in both the southern and northern regions of China. In the north, many areas experienced severe droughts in the spring and summer, and some areas remained dry until autumn, with the drought lasting for seven to eight months. In the south, many areas experienced low temperatures and heavy rains in the spring, and then droughts in the summer and autumn, with the drought lasting for about three months. Whether in the south or the north, a considerable number of areas have been affected by pests, with the most severe being the caterpillar pests in Northeast China and North China. In addition, some areas have also experienced heavy rains, typhoons, hail, and earthquakes. This has created many difficulties for grain production. Of course, the severity of natural disasters this year, compared to the past seventeen years since liberation, is of medium level. Whether in terms of the area affected by disasters or the area severely affected, it is smaller than during the three years of natural disasters. This situation shows that after the establishment of people's communes, the advantages of "big and public" have been fully utilized, and continuous agricultural infrastructure construction has been carried out, which has played a role in resisting natural disasters. But most importantly, it fully proves that the factor of man is decisive. Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are fearless; they are not afraid of the sky, not afraid of the earth, not afraid of hard work, not afraid of suffering, and dare to struggle and dare to win. Relying on this fearless revolutionary spirit, they have overcome the numerous difficulties caused by disasters and ensured that grain production has developed significantly compared to last year.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "People's social existence determines people's thoughts. And the correct thoughts representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force to transform society and the world." It is precisely through the continuous study of Chairman Mao's works that the broad masses of peasants and rural cadres across the country have consciously armed their minds and guided their actions with Mao Zedong Thought, making them an invincible force in the struggle to transform nature and develop production.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the realm of production struggle and scientific experimentation, humanity is always developing, and nature is also always developing, never stopping at one level. Therefore, humanity must always summarize experiences, make discoveries, make inventions, make creations, and make progress." Last winter and this spring, cadres and masses across the country, following the teachings of the great leader, generally conducted a thorough summary of the experiences in developing grain production in the past. Through this summary, people not only understood the truth that grain production can continuously develop but also understood that continuously changing the appearance of farmland is an important prerequisite for the continuous development of grain production. Various places have also, through a serious summary of past experiences, further mastered the laws of agricultural infrastructure construction and created many advanced construction methods. In this way, the agricultural infrastructure construction this year not only has an unprecedentedly large scale but also has a faster pace, better quality, and more economical investment than any previous year. The rapid, good, and economical development of agricultural infrastructure construction has laid a more solid material foundation for the development of grain production in various places under the condition of relatively severe natural disasters.

While vigorously developing agricultural infrastructure construction and accelerating the transformation of farmland, various places have also, following Chairman Mao's teachings, launched a mass movement of agricultural technological reform, starting from the specific conditions of each place, and comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's "eight-character constitution" for agriculture. Whether in the south or the north, the level of fertilization and field management has generally improved to varying degrees compared to last year; deep plowing, dense planting, and other advanced technologies have been more widely valued by the masses; the work of promoting improved varieties and plant protection has developed further; and the cause of agricultural mechanization has also shown a new situation. In addition, the reform of cultivation systems, with the south focusing on expanding double-cropping rice and the north focusing on expanding intercropping and relay cropping, has also accelerated its pace. All of these have played an important role in promoting grain production this year.

To ensure the increase in grain production this year, the masses and cadres across the country have waged an unyielding struggle against natural disasters. The frequent and severe natural disasters have indeed created many difficulties for production. However, Chairman Mao's teachings of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory" and "our comrades should see achievements and see the light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage" have pointed out the direction for the masses and cadres across the country and given them boundless confidence and strength to overcome all difficulties. In the spring, severe droughts caused uneven germination in some northern regions, and the masses and cadres in these regions, to ensure full and strong seedlings, bravely carried water to combat drought, replanted, and reseeded, with some regions replanting and reseeding up to five or six times. After entering the summer, the drought continued to develop in both the south and the north, and the affected area continued to expand. At this time, various places launched an even more powerful anti-drought struggle, proposing slogans such as "Fight the drought until the heavens yield, and do not retreat until victory is achieved!" and "No matter how big the disaster, our determination to overcome it is even greater!" In addition to fully utilizing the existing water conservancy facilities, people also used every means to find new water sources, rushed to build new water conservancy facilities such as canals, dams, wells, and sluices, and utilized mountain water, spring water, river water, and lake water for the anti-drought struggle. The masses and cadres across the country have also waged a tenacious struggle against pests, typhoons, heavy rains, and hail. It is through a series of heroic struggles that they have finally forced the disasters to yield and achieved the great victory of disaster resistance and increased production.

In reviewing the year's struggle, the broad masses of peasants and rural cadres across the country all pointed out with great emotion that the victory of grain production and disaster resistance this year is the victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the victory of the masses and cadres firmly acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They said: "No matter how big the natural disasters are, they cannot intimidate those armed with Mao Zedong Thought!" "No matter how difficult, with Mao Zedong Thought in hand, it is not difficult!" Through the summary of the year's struggle experience, the masses and cadres across the country have further deeply realized that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work, and whether or not to act according to Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental factor in whether all work can achieve victory. The masses and cadres across the country are determined, following the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to more widely and deeply study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology, and to establish proletarian ideology, pushing China's grain production to a new stage.

    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最强大的战斗力最强大的生产力
    全国粮食生产获得解放十七年来最大丰收
    今年农业战线出现了具有重大战略意义的新情况：无论以种水稻为主的南方地区，还是以种旱粮为主的北方地区，都普遍增产；北方地区增产幅度明显地大于南方，有相当一部分粮食长期不能自给的专区和县，今年已做到自给或基本自给，有的已自给有余。这就说明，旱粮作物完全能够高产，历史性的“南粮北调”的局面完全可以改变。
    新华社二十七日讯　我国广大农民群众和农村干部，不断地用毛泽东思想武装头脑，坚定地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，今年在发展粮食生产的斗争中又取得了巨大的新成就。全国粮食的总产量和单位面积产量，都比收成很好的去年又有较大的上升，是解放十七年来最大的丰收。这个新成就是在自然灾害相当严重的情况下取得的。它又一次极其生动有力地证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，不仅是最强大的战斗力，而且也是最强大的生产力。
    今年我国粮食生产的一个鲜明的特点是，无论是以种水稻为主的南方地区还是以种旱粮为主的北方地区，都普遍比去年增产；其中北方地区增产幅度还明显地大于南方地区。在整个北方地区，已经有相当一部分粮食长期不能自给的专区和县，由于今年粮食大面积、大幅度增产而做到自给或基本自给，有的更已做到自给有余。这就令人信服地说明，长时期处于低产状态的旱粮作物，是完全能够高产的；历史性的“南粮北调”的局面，是完全可以改变的。出现在我国粮食生产中的这一具有重大战略意义的新情况，说明我国粮食生产有着极其广阔的发展前景，我们应该更加充满信心地向着美好的未来奋勇前进。
    今年，我国南北各地都曾出现相当严重的自然灾害。在北方，不少地区春夏两季都处在严重的干旱中，有的直到秋季旱象仍未解除，受旱时间长达七八个月之久。在南方，不少地区春季低温多雨，夏秋两季又相继出现干旱，受旱时间也持续了三个月左右。无论是南方还是北方，都有相当一部分地区发生虫害，其中东北和华北不少地区粘虫为害更为严重。此外，还有一部分地区分别出现了暴雨、台风、冰雹和地震等自然灾害。这样，就给粮食生产造成了许许多多的困难。当然，今年自然灾害为害的程度，从解放十七年来看，还是中等的。无论是受灾面积或成灾面积，都比三年大灾时期小。这种情况说明人民公社化之后，发挥了人民公社一大二公的优越性，连续地进行了农田基本建设，起到了抗拒自然灾害的作用。但最主要的，更充分证明了人的因素第一完全正确。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，无所畏惧，他们不怕天，不怕地，不怕累，不怕苦，敢于斗争、敢于胜利。靠着这种大无畏的革命精神，他们排除了灾害造成的重重困难，保证粮食生产比去年又有较大的发展。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”我国广大农民群众和农村干部，正是通过不断地学习毛主席的著作，自觉地用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑和指导自己的行动，才使他们在改造自然、发展生产的斗争中成了不可战胜的力量。
    毛主席教导我们：“在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。因此，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”去冬今春，各地干部和群众按照伟大领袖的教导，比较普遍地对过去发展粮食生产的经验进行了深入的总结。通过总结，人们不仅懂得了粮食生产可以不断地向前发展这个真理，并且也懂得了不断地改变农田面貌，是促进粮食生产不断发展的重要前提。各地还通过对过去经验的认真总结，进一步地掌握了农田基本建设的规律，创造了许多先进的施工方法。这样，就使得一年来的农田基本建设，不但具有空前巨大的规模，而且进度之快、质量之好和投资之省，也超过以往任何一年。农田基本建设多快好省地向前发展，为各地在自然灾害相当严重的条件下发展粮食生产，奠定了更加坚实的物质基础。
    各地在大力发展农田基本建设，加速改变农田面貌的同时，还按照毛主席的教导，开展了群众性的农业技术改革运动，从各地的具体情况出发，全面地贯彻毛主席提出的农业“八字宪法”。无论是南方或是北方，施肥水平和田间管理的水平，都普遍比去年有不同程度的提高；深耕、密植等先进技术，更加普遍地受到广大群众的重视；良种推广工作和植物保护工作，有了进一步的发展；农业机械化事业也出现了新的气象。此外，南方以扩大双季稻为主、北方以扩大间作套种为主的耕作制度改革，也加速了前进的步伐。所有这些，对今年粮食生产也起了重要的推动作用。
    为确保今年粮食增产，各地群众和干部向自然灾害进行了不屈不挠的斗争。频繁而严重的自然灾害，给生产造成的困难真是多极了。但是，毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，和“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气”的教导，为各地群众和干部指明了前进的方向，给他们增添了战胜各种困难的无穷的信心和力量。春天，严重的干旱使北方一些地区的粮田出苗不齐，这些地区的群众和干部为保证苗全苗壮，就奋起挑水抗旱，补种、补苗，有的地区连续补了五六次。入夏以后，南北各地旱情继续发展，受旱面积不断扩大。这时，各地掀起了声势更加浩大的抗旱斗争，提出了“抗旱抗到天低头，不获全胜不收兵！”“灾害再大，比不上我们战胜灾害的决心大！”等气壮山河的口号。人们除充分发挥原有水利设施的作用外，还千方百计地寻找新水源，突击增修渠、坝、井、闸等新的水利设施，利用山水、泉水、江水、湖水为抗旱斗争服务。各地群众和干部还向虫害、台风、暴雨和雹灾等各种自然灾害，进行了顽强的斗争。正是经过一系列的英勇斗争，才终于逼使天灾低头，夺得了抗灾增产的伟大胜利。
    我国各地广大农民群众和农村干部在回顾一年来的斗争经历时，无不万分激动地指出，今年粮食抗灾增产的胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，是广大群众和干部坚定地照毛主席的指示办事的胜利。他们说：“自然灾害再大，也吓不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的人！”“千难万难，掌握了毛泽东思想就不难！”各地群众和干部通过对一年的斗争经验进行总结，进一步深切地认识到毛泽东思想是进行一切工作的指导方针，能不能按照毛泽东思想办事，是一切工作能否取得胜利的根本。各地群众和干部决心按照林彪同志的指示，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更广泛、更深入地活学活用毛主席著作，大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想，把我国粮食生产推向一个更新的阶段。
