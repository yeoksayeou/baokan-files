Some Japanese friends who recently visited China made statements before their return home, enthusiastically praising the revolutionary actions of Chinese Red Guards who are undaunted by the difficulties of long marches.

Ito Takeo said, "We saw Red Guard long march teams everywhere in China. They broadly contact workers and peasants, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and receive good tempering. The revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards who are undaunted by the difficulties of long marches has extremely profound significance."

Miyazaki Seimin said, "In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards have played a very important role in propagating and carrying out Mao Zedong Thought. Now, the Red Guards are responding to Chairman Mao's call to undertake revolutionary tours on foot, more broadly contacting the masses, and tempering themselves to become stronger. They will become excellent successors to the Chinese revolution."

    伊藤武雄说，我们在中国到处都看到红卫兵的长征队，他们广泛接触工农群众，宣传毛泽东思想，得到很好的锻炼，红卫兵不怕远征难的革命精神，具有非常深远的意义。
    宫崎世民说，红卫兵在文化大革命中宣传和贯彻毛泽东思想，起了很重要的作用。现在，红卫兵响应毛主席的号召进行徒步革命串连，更广泛地接触群众，锻炼得更坚强，他们将成为中国革命的优秀接班人。
