The Portuguese authorities in Macau have intensified their fascist atrocities, committing an even more serious bloody incident. In recent days, they have deployed large numbers of military and police forces, killing and injuring 83 Macau patriots.

The oppressed patriots, facing the Portuguese imperialists, are fighting with high spirits and unyielding courage.

Hong Kong, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) - According to news from Macau, after brutally suppressing and injuring more than 40 residents of the Taipa area on November 15, the Portuguese authorities in Macau have escalated their actions and dared to confront all the people of Macau. On December 3 and 4, they deployed large numbers of armed military and police forces, deliberately creating a more serious fascist bloody incident. Preliminary investigations have revealed that 83 Macau patriots were killed or injured.

On the morning of December 3, more than 90 Macau patriotic teachers and student representatives went to the "Governor's Office" of the Portuguese authorities to protest against the Taipa incident and demand that Governor Cabral immediately and thoroughly implement the five serious demands of the Macau people, severely punishing the main culprits, former "Deputy Commissioner of the Police" Ian D. and Acting Director of the Taipa Municipal Administration Yung Tak-kei. However, Cabral not only refused to meet with the teachers and students but also instructed a Portuguese official to lure the teachers and students upstairs, then closed all the doors and passages. Several dozen Portuguese police, most of whom had removed their police numbers, under the personal command of the "Commissioner of Police" Fook Lee, wielded batons and beat the unarmed teachers and students, pushing them down from the second floor. Many teachers and students were injured and fell to the ground. After the teachers and students were pushed down, they were beaten again by the Portuguese police waiting downstairs. The police upstairs also threw flowerpots at the teachers and students from above. After most of the teachers and students (some of whom were only 11 or 12 years old) were injured and driven out of the "Governor's Office," Fook Lee ordered the "riot control squad" to spray the teachers and students with high-pressure water while attacking the crowd, beating anyone they saw, and repeatedly throwing tear gas canisters at the teachers, students, and the public.

The more than 90 patriotic teachers and students, facing the insane Portuguese imperialists' beatings, fought with high spirits. They were beaten down but stood up again, holding hands and continuing the struggle, protesting against the Portuguese authorities' atrocities. They shouted, "Immediately implement the five demands of the Macau people and the protest of the Macau Daily," "We will not rest until we achieve complete victory." Some students bravely picked up the tear gas canisters and threw them back at the police. The teachers and students' just struggle received active support from the onlookers, who together condemned the Portuguese authorities' atrocities. By 3 p.m., the crowd withdrew in an orderly manner.

While the patriotic teachers and students were being beaten, the Portuguese police also beat reporters covering the scene, seized cameras, attempted to suppress the news, and illegally detained reporters from the Macau Daily, Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, and Hong Kong English-language Star newspaper.

At 6 p.m. on December 3, the Portuguese authorities imposed a curfew, deploying large numbers of military and police forces, armored vehicles, and tanks into the main streets. These criminals brazenly opened fire with rifles and machine guns at the shops and residents on both sides of the streets, crazily killing Macau Chinese compatriots. According to the information available now, on that day, five Chinese compatriots were killed, and 66 were injured.

The Macau Daily published an editorial on December 4, strongly condemning the bloody crime committed by the Portuguese imperialists in Macau against the Macau people on December 3. The editorial pointed out that the large-scale suppression by the Portuguese authorities was well-organized and premeditated, "its nature is extremely serious, and the consequences are also extremely serious." The Portuguese imperialists in Macau have gone insane and dared to confront the Chinese people of Macau. They must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences that follow.

However, the Portuguese imperialists' atrocities of killing Chinese compatriots in Macau have not stopped and continued on December 4. On that day, the Portuguese military and police again opened fire, killing two people and injuring ten. Preliminary investigations have shown that 83 Chinese compatriots in Macau were killed or injured by the Portuguese military and police on December 3 and 4, with seven deaths and 76 injuries.

The patriotic people of Macau, facing the insane persecution and beatings by the Portuguese imperialists, are fearless and dare to fight. On the morning of December 3, the Portuguese police wielded batons and beat the Macau compatriots. The Macau compatriots, facing the ferocious Portuguese police, sternly rebuked them with righteous indignation.

    澳葡当局变本加厉制造更严重的法西斯暴行血案
    连日出动大批军警打死打伤八十三名澳门爱国同胞
    受迫害的爱国同胞面对葡萄牙帝国主义者，斗志昂扬，英勇不屈
    新华社香港五日电　据澳门消息：澳门葡萄牙当局继十一月十五日残暴迫害、打伤四十多名澳门凼仔地区的居民后，又变本加厉，胆敢与全澳门同胞为敌，于十二月三日和四日连续出动大批武装军警，蓄意制造了更为严重的法西斯暴行血案，初步查明，有八十三名澳门爱国同胞被打死打伤。
    三日上午十时许，先后有九十多名澳门爱国教师、学生代表前往澳葡“总督府”，就凼仔血案向澳葡总督嘉乐庇提出严重抗议，要求嘉乐庇立即彻底执行澳门同胞的五项严正要求，严惩主凶、原澳葡“警察厅第一副厅长”颜端尼和代理海岛市行政局长晏德地。但嘉乐庇不仅不接见师生代表，反而指使一个澳葡官员引诱师生代表上二楼，然后把大门和所有通道的门关闭起来，几十名预先埋伏好的并且大部分剥去警察号码的葡警，在澳葡“警察厅长”傅基利的亲自指挥下，挥舞胶棍，毒打手无寸铁的师生，把他们从二楼推落楼下，很多师生当场被打伤和摔伤。当师生们被推下楼后，又遭到预伏在那里的澳葡警察的毒打，楼上的葡警还从高处向师生投掷花盆。当大部分师生代表（其中有的只有十一、二岁）被打伤赶出澳葡“总督府”后，傅基利又指挥“防暴队”一面用强力的水龙喷射师生，一面扑向人群，见人就打，并向师生和群众多次投掷催泪瓦斯弹。
    受到迫害的九十多名爱国师生代表在丧心病狂的葡萄牙帝国主义者的毒打面前，斗志昂扬，他们被打倒下去又站起来，相互手挽手坚持斗争，抗议澳葡当局的暴行。他们高呼：“立即执行澳门同胞的五项要求和《澳门日报》的抗议”，“不获全胜，决不罢休”。有的学生勇敢地拾起催泪弹向警察掷回去。师生们的正义斗争受到在场群众的积极支持，他们与爱国师生一起愤怒斥责澳葡当局的暴行。至下午三时，群众有秩序地撤退。
    在爱国师生被毒打的同时，葡警还殴打在现场采访的新闻记者，抢走摄影机，企图封锁消息，并无理扣押了《澳门日报》、香港《大公报》、香港英文《星报》等报的记者。
    三日下午六时，澳葡当局实行宵禁，把大批军警、装甲车和坦克开入主要街道，这批凶手悍然向街道两旁的店铺和居民开动步枪和机关枪，疯狂地杀害澳门中国同胞。据现在已经知道的，在三日这一天，有五名中国同胞被打死，六十六名被打伤。
    《澳门日报》四日曾发表社论，强烈谴责澳门葡萄牙帝国主义者在三日对澳门同胞犯下的这一血腥罪行。社论指出，澳葡当局的大迫害，完全是有组织、有预谋的，“其性质是极其严重的，后果也是极其严重的”。澳门葡萄牙帝国主义者丧心病狂，胆敢与澳门中国同胞为敌，由此引起的一切严重后果他们必须负完全的责任。
    然而，澳葡帝国主义者残杀我澳门中国同胞的暴行并没有停止，至四日还在继续。四日，澳葡军警又开枪杀害澳门中国同胞，有二人死亡，十人受伤。据初步调查统计，三日和四日两天被澳葡军警打死打伤的澳门中国同胞共计八十三人，其中死亡七人，受伤七十六人。（附图片）
    澳门爱国同胞在丧心病狂的葡萄牙帝国主义者的迫害、毒打面前，不怕牺牲，敢于斗争。十二月三日上午，澳葡警察挥动胶棍殴打澳门同胞，澳门同胞面对穷凶极恶的葡警，严词斥责，正气凛然。
