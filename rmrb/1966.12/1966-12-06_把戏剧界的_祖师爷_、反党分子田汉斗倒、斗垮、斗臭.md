The self-proclaimed "patriarch" of the drama world, Tian Han, is a counter-revolutionary revisionist and a capitalist-roader within the party. Under the protection of the anti-party leader Zhou Yang in the literary and artistic circles, Tian Han has long been usurping the position of the former chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, recruiting and colluding in the drama world, stirring up trouble, and promoting a line of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism.

Over the past decade since the founding of the nation, the class struggle in the drama world has been extremely intense and sharp. In every struggle, Tian Han has always stubbornly stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, resisting and opposing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, and brazenly engaging in anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought criminal activities.

Tian Han yearns for capitalism and hates socialism. He enthusiastically promotes and vigorously advocates for counter-revolutionary dramatic art that maintains the old system. He harshly criticizes and fiercely opposes revolutionary modern dramas that serve socialism. He obstinately obstructs and vigorously sabotages the great revolutionary innovation of reforming old Peking opera. Tian Han's vigorous promotion of feudal and bourgeois dramatic art and opposition to proletarian dramatic art is to prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

The proletarian cultural revolution in the literary and artistic circles, starting from the revolution of Peking opera, has broken through the numerous obstacles of Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, Tian Han, and others, and destroyed their counter-revolutionary restoration base, exposing the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique in the literary and artistic circles. However, to thoroughly overthrow them, to thoroughly eliminate their pernicious influence, we must go through a serious struggle. As long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, trust the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and thoroughly criticize the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, we will definitely be able to complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform, and achieve a complete victory in the proletarian cultural revolution in the literary and artistic circles.

Tian Han is a counter-revolutionary revisionist who has infiltrated the party and is the vanguard of the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought in the drama world.

Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times and is the most powerful ideological weapon of the proletariat. All anti-party conspirators hiding within the party who plot to usurp the party, the government, the army, and the leadership of literature and art will definitely denigrate, distort, attack, and oppose Mao Zedong Thought. Tian Han is no exception. He curses that Mao Zedong Thought is outdated and slanders that Mao Zedong Thought is not a universal truth applicable everywhere. Under the instructions and protection of Zhou Yang, Tian Han has been brazenly engaging in anti-party, anti-socialist, and counter-revolutionary activities to restore capitalism in the drama world and wherever he goes.

In 1956, Tian Han published the poisonous weeds "A Plea for the Youth of Actors" and "We Must Truly Care for and Improve the Lives of Artists," and personally went to Hunan and Guangxi to privately convene so-called "old artists" meetings, inciting and directing rightist elements in the drama world to attack the party, serving as the commander and vanguard of the rightist attack.

He slandered that socialist society has "little democratic atmosphere and people dare not speak"; he attacked the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's communes as "empty things" and "brain fever."

In 1961, Tian Han adopted the insidious method of using ancient times to satirize the present, using the cover of historical plays, and created the poisonous weed "Xie Yao Huan," crazily inciting all the ghosts and monsters who are dissatisfied with the socialist system to overthrow proletarian dictatorship.

Tian Han recklessly defamed Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," slandering this brilliant work as merely a speech to "correct" the biases of a time and place, now outdated. Chairman Mao instructed us: "Past literary and artistic works are not the source but the flow." Tian Han said: "Our creations today, if separated from tradition, are like water without a source and trees without roots"; Chairman Mao pointed out: literature and art for the landlord class is feudal literature and art. Tian Han said: "Where did our traditional things come from? It is not like what we used to say, it is 'feudal art'."

Tian Han completely denied revolutionary modern dramas, defaming those that embody Mao Zedong Thought as worthless and a mess. He said that revolutionary modern dramas have "crisis," are "boiling water dramas," and are "a passing fad," defaming the slogan of serving proletarian politics, writing the center, performing the center, and singing the center as "making the themes of spoken drama narrower and narrower, more and more detached from the tastes of the masses." Tian Han stubbornly resisted the socialist transformation of drama, defaming that not performing or performing less capitalist foreign dramas is a national disgrace; he also insulted the reform of opera as not "respecting" the "dramatic tradition" of feudalism, as unfilial children of the Chinese nation.

Tian Han seized every opportunity to boast about and peddle the bourgeois black goods of the "1930s" drama, such as how the dramas of the 1930s have "revolutionary nature" and "artistic nature"! How the drama workers of the 1930s had already found the "socialist path" and "united with workers, peasants, and soldiers"! How the dramas of the "1930s" had paved the way for the "socialist superstructure"! Tian Han and his gang used the bourgeois black goods of the 1930s to resist Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thoughts, usurp the party's leadership of literary and artistic work, and establish their bourgeois counter-revolutionary dictatorship in the literary and artistic circles.

In 1957, after plotting with Zhou Yang, Tian Han, along with other counter-revolutionary revisionists such as Xia Yan and Yang Han Sheng, jointly issued a proposal for the "50th Anniversary of the Spoken Drama Movement." Tian Han was not only the mastermind of this conspiracy but also took the lead in publicly shouting to summarize the so-called experience of the 1930s literature to "correct the current work." This commemorative activity was a rehearsal of the organized, planned, and programmed counter-revolutionary restoration after liberation in the drama world.

Tian Han is a disgraceful traitor to the party and the people, a veteran anti-communist. Since the 1920s, he has attached himself to the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek and consorted with the Nationalist reactionaries. In 1932, he infiltrated the party, and in 1935, when he was arrested in Nanjing, he betrayed the party. After his release, he wrote and performed anti-communist dramas. In 1938, Tian Han published "Dialogue on the Spring Boat Tower," which, through the dialogue between the traitor Li Hongzhang and the Japanese militarist leader Ito Hirobumi when signing the treacherous and humiliating "Treaty of Shimonoseki," defamed the revolutionary people's exposure of the traitor as "speaking cheap words"; it directly collaborated with the then Chiang Kai-shek gang's plot of capitulation and surrender to Japan, and sang the opposite tune to Chairman Mao's exposure and struggle against Chiang Kai-shek's national betrayal. In his "Selected Works of Tian Han" published in 1961, he also included the reactionary play "Lugou Bridge" that whitewashed the Nationalists.

Tian Han also spared no effort to whitewash traitors, collaborators, and national betrayers. He claimed: "A person has a long journey, choose a good part of him, omit the rest, that is criticism." He regarded Hou Fangyu, Li Xiucheng, Yang Yanhui, Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang, Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi... as great figures, great heroes, and wanted to affirm them, to write plays and biographies for these people. He also highly appreciated and even shamelessly proposed to learn from the Soviet modern revisionist literary works that beautify traitors, cowards, advocate bourgeois humanitarianism, and the philosophy of survival. His activities, internationally, were to collaborate with the Khrushchev revisionist leadership in pushing the traitor line of false anti-imperialism and true surrender, and domestically, to create spiritual conditions for the restoration of capitalism.

Tian Han has always self-proclaimed as the "old man" and "patriarch" of the drama world. He recruits and colludes, buys and lures a group of ghosts and monsters in the drama world and society, forming a clique, and together engages in anti-party and anti-socialist criminal activities. Tian Han crazily shouted, "Today, we have to force ourselves to form our own organization," and shamelessly advocated, "The spoken drama world needs its own leader." It is obvious that the "own organization" Tian Han plotted is a capitalist restoration party, and he regards himself as the leader of this restoration party.

Tian Han extremely hates the proletarian cultural revolution and stubbornly resists and sabotages the proletarian cultural revolution. He fiercely resists and opposes the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee on literary and artistic work. At the end of 1963, at the fourth enlarged meeting of the standing committee of the Dramatists Association, he directly opposed Chairman Mao's criticism of literary and artistic work.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Socialist transformation in many departments has so far been ineffective." Tian Han said: "In the past fourteen years, there have been some achievements."

Chairman Mao pointed out: "In many departments, the 'dead' are still in control." Tian Han said: "The dead are also needed." He even confused right and wrong, saying, "Now we write about Lei Feng, he is also dead!"

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Many communists enthusiastically advocate feudal and capitalist art." Tian Han said: "Walking on one leg will also cause problems." He talked about "two legs walking" but in reality continued to promote feudal and capitalist art. Tian Han even went so far as to slander that Chairman Mao's instructions have "little value." He also went to Shanghai to publicly oppose and sabotage the promotion of revolutionary modern dramas at the East China Spoken Drama Festival.

In the fake rectification movement in the cultural departments in 1964, Tian Han put up fierce resistance to the proletarian cultural revolution. Chairman Mao criticized the literary and artistic circles: "These associations and the publications they control (it is said that there are a few good ones) have basically (not all) not implemented the party's policies for fifteen years, acted as officials and lords, did not approach workers, peasants, and soldiers, and did not reflect the socialist revolution and construction. In recent years, they have even fallen to the brink of revisionism. If they are not seriously reformed, they will inevitably become like the Petofi Club in Hungary on some day in the future." In his "self-criticism," Tian Han said: I always feel that I have basically acted according to the party's policies in the past decade or so. I have long written articles and speeches, emphasizing the need to go deep into the workers, peasants, and soldiers. And said: "If I am wrong, at least I am not far from the wrong path." After the fake rectification ended, he still sat on the "patriarch" throne of the drama world under the protection of Zhou Yang and others.

However, in this proletarian cultural revolution, his ugly face has been exposed. We must press on and thoroughly overthrow, smash, and expose this "patriarch" of the drama world, the anti-party element Tian Han!

    把戏剧界的“祖师爷”、反党分子田汉斗倒、斗垮、斗臭
    编者按：自封为戏剧界“祖师爷”的田汉，是文艺界的一个反革命修正主义分子、党内走资本主义道路的当权派。在文艺界反党头目周扬的庇护下，田汉一直窃踞着前中国戏剧家协会主席的职务，在戏剧界招降纳叛，兴风作浪，推行着一条封建主义、资本主义、修正主义路线。
    建国十多年来，戏剧界的阶级斗争是十分激烈、十分尖锐的。在历次斗争中，田汉总是顽固地站在反动的资产阶级立场上，抵制和反对毛主席的文艺路线，猖狂地进行了反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动。
    田汉留恋资本主义，仇视社会主义。他对维护旧制度的反革命戏剧艺术，热心提倡，拚命鼓吹。他对为社会主义服务的革命现代戏，横加指责，疯狂反对。他对改革旧京剧的伟大革命创举，百般阻挠，竭力破坏。田汉拚命鼓吹封建阶级、资产阶级的戏剧艺术，反对无产阶级的戏剧艺术，就是为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。
    从京剧革命开始的文艺界的无产阶级文化大革命，冲破了周扬、林默涵、田汉等人的重重阻碍，摧毁了他们一伙的反革命复辟阵地，揭出了文艺界的反革命修正主义集团。但是，要彻底斗垮他们，彻底肃清他们的恶劣影响，还要经过严重的斗争。只要我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻以毛主席为代表的革命路线，相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，彻底批判资产阶级的反动路线，我们就一定能够完成一斗二批三改的任务，使文艺界的无产阶级文化大革命获得全胜。
    田汉是混进党内的反革命修正主义分子，是戏剧界反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的急先锋。
    毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是无产阶级最强大的思想武器。一切隐藏在党内的反党野心家阴谋篡党、篡政、篡军，篡夺文艺领导权，就一定要贬低、歪曲、攻击和反对毛泽东思想。田汉也是如此。他咒骂毛泽东思想已经过时，诬蔑毛泽东思想不是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。在周扬的指使和庇护下，田汉在戏剧界，在他所到的地方，猖狂地进行反党反社会主义复辟资本主义的罪恶活动。
    一九五六年，田汉发表了《为演员的青春请命》《必须切实关心并改善艺人的生活》等大毒草，还亲赴湖南、广西等地私自召开所谓“老艺人”座谈会，煽动和指挥戏剧界的右派分子向党进攻，充当了右派进攻的主帅和急先锋。
    他诬蔑社会主义社会“民主空气不浓，有人不敢说话”；攻击总路线、大跃进、人民公社是“空虚的东西”，是“头脑发热”。
    一九六一年，田汉采取了借古讽今的阴险手法，打着历史戏的幌子，炮制了大毒草《谢瑶环》，疯狂地煽动一切对社会主义制度心怀不满的牛鬼蛇神，起来推翻无产阶级专政。
    田汉肆意诋毁毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，把这个光辉的著作，诬蔑为只是“纠”一时一地之“偏”的讲话，现在已经过时。毛主席指示我们：
  “过去的文艺作品不是源而是流”，田汉则说：“我们今天的创造，如果离开传统，就是无源之水，无根之木”；毛主席指出：文艺是为地主阶级的，这是封建主义的文艺。田汉却说：“我们传统的东西是那里来的呢？并不像我们过去所讲的，它是‘封建艺术’。”等等。
    田汉全面否定革命现代戏，把体现毛泽东思想的革命现代戏，诬蔑得一无是处，一塌胡涂。他胡说革命现代戏有“危机”，是“开水戏”，是“一阵风”，诬蔑为无产阶级政治服务的写中心、演中心、唱中心的口号是“徒然使话剧题材越来越窄狭，越来越脱离群众的好尚”。田汉顽固抵制戏剧上的社会主义改造，诋毁我们不演或少演资本主义的外国戏是国耻；他还辱骂戏曲改革是不“尊重”封建主义的“戏剧传统”，是中华民族的不肖子孙。
    田汉一有机会就大肆吹嘘和贩卖“三十年代”戏剧的资产阶级黑货，什么三十年代的戏剧有“革命性”又有“文艺性”呀！什么三十年代的戏剧工作者早已找到了“社会主义道路”和“工农兵结合”了呀！什么“三十年代”的戏剧已为“社会主义上层建筑开辟了道路”呀！田汉及其一伙，就是用三十年代的资产阶级黑货来抵制毛主席文艺思想，篡夺党对文艺事业的领导，在文艺界建立他们的资产阶级反革命专政。
    一九五七年，田汉在与周扬进行策划之后，纠合夏衍、阳翰笙等反革命修正主义分子，联名抛出了“话剧运动五十年纪念”的建议书。田汉不仅是这次阴谋活动的主谋者，而且赤膊上阵，公开叫嚷要总结所谓三十年代文艺的经验，来“改正当前的工作”。这次纪念活动是解放后戏剧界的一次有组织、有计划、有纲领的反革命复辟预演。
    田汉是一个党和人民的可耻叛徒，是一个反共老手。自二十年代起，他就投靠人民公敌蒋介石，和国民党反动派同流合污。一九三二年，他混入党内，一九三五年，在南京被捕时叛党，出狱后就大写大演反共戏剧。一九三八年，田汉发表了《春帆楼上的对话》，这个剧本通过卖国贼李鸿章和日本军国主义头子伊藤博文订立丧权辱国的“马关条约”时的对话，辱骂革命人民对卖国贼的揭露是讲“便宜话”；直接配合了当时蒋介石匪帮搞的对日妥协投降的大阴谋，和毛主席对于蒋介石的民族投降主义的揭露和斗争唱对台戏。他在一九六一年出版的《田汉选集》里，还收入了为国民党涂脂抹粉的反动剧本《芦沟桥》。
    田汉还费尽心机地为叛徒、汉奸卖国贼涂脂抹粉。他宣称：“一个人，有很长的历程，选他一点好的，略掉其他，这就是批判。”他把侯方域、李秀成、杨延辉、曾国藩、李鸿章、陈独秀、胡适……当成大人物，大英雄，要给以“肯定”，要为这些人写戏立传。他对美化叛徒、胆小鬼，宣扬资产阶级人道主义和活命哲学的苏联现代修正主义的文艺作品，也非常赏识，甚至无耻地提出要向苏联修正主义的文艺“学习”。他的这些活动，在国际上是为了配合赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导集团推行假反帝真投降的叛徒路线，在国内则是为了给资本主义复辟创造精神条件。
    田汉一贯自封为戏剧界的“老头子”和“祖师爷”。他招降纳叛，收买、拉拢戏剧界和社会上一批牛鬼蛇神，结成死党，合伙进行反党反社会主义的罪恶勾当。田汉疯狂叫嚣“今天要逼得我们非成立自己的组织不可”，并且无耻鼓吹“话剧界要有自己的领袖”。很明显，田汉策划的“自己的组织”就是一个资本主义复辟党，他自命为这个复辟党的领袖。
    田汉极端仇视无产阶级文化大革命，顽固地反对和破坏无产阶级文化大革命。他对毛主席和党中央关于文艺工作的指示，极力抵制、疯狂反对。在一九六三年底召开的剧协第四次常务理事（扩大）会议上，他直接对抗毛主席对文艺工作的批评。
    毛主席指出：“社会主义改造在许多部门中，至今收效甚微。”田汉却说：“十四年来，都有些成就。”
    毛主席指出：“许多部门至今还是‘死人’统治着。”田汉却说：“死人也要”。他甚至混淆是非，说“现在我们写雷锋，他也是死人呀！”
    毛主席指出：“许多共产党人热心提倡封建主义和资本主义的艺术”。田汉却说：“一条腿走路，也会出毛病的。”他嘴上讲要“两者并举”，实际上是继续推行封建主义、资本主义的艺术。田汉甚至丧心病狂地诬蔑毛主席的批示“没有多大价值”。他还赶赴上海，公开反对和破坏提倡革命现代剧的华东话剧会演。
    田汉在一九六四年文化部门的假整风中，对无产阶级文化大革命进行顽固的抵抗，毛主席批评文艺界：“这些协会和他们所掌握的刊物的大多数（据说有少数几个好的），十五年来，基本上（不是一切人）不执行党的政策，做官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。最近几年，竟然跌到了修正主义的边缘。如不认真改造，势必在将来的某一天，要变成像匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体”。田汉在他的“检讨”中却说：我总觉得自己十几年来基本上还是按党的政策办事的。我早就写文章、讲话，强调要深入工农兵了。并说：“倘使错了，至少是迷途未远。”假整风结束后，他又在周扬等人的庇护下依然坐在戏剧界“祖师爷”的宝座上。
    但是，在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，他的丑恶面目已经原形毕露。我们一定要乘胜追击，把这个戏剧界的“祖师爷”、反党分子田汉彻底斗倒，斗垮，斗臭！
