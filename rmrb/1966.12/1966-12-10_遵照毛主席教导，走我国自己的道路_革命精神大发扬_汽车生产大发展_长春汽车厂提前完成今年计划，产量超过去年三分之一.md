Following Chairman Mao's instructions, we will walk our own path. Revolutionary spirit is flourishing, and automobile production is booming. The First Automobile Works in Changchun has completed this year's plan ahead of schedule, with production exceeding last year's by one-third.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, December 8th: The revolutionary workers of the First Automobile Works have, in the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, further raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They have enthusiastically studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and both revolutionary spirit and automobile production have flourished.

By November 25th, the factory had completed the state's automobile production plan for the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule by 36 days. Automobile production has increased by 36.3% compared to last year, with stable and improved quality. Costs and material consumption have also significantly decreased compared to last year. Additionally, they have successfully developed new products, including a new type of advanced "Red Flag" luxury car, three types of heavy-duty trucks, two types of off-road vehicles, two types of large buses, and six types of new engines for heavy-duty trucks.

Under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution sweeping the nation and the inspiration of Comrade Lin Biao's call to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works at the First Automobile Works in Changchun has seen new developments. Through in-depth study of the "Three Old Articles," the workers have gained a higher perspective and broader vision. As long as it aligns with Mao Zedong Thought and benefits production and the people, regardless of whether it is within one's scope or not, they strive to do it with a thorough and complete revolutionary spirit. Conversely, anything that is not beneficial to production or the masses is firmly opposed and eliminated. Previously, the factory had adopted a foreign concept called "organizational design," consisting of 62 thick volumes and 16.5 million words, with countless rules and regulations that tightly constrained the workers' revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity. Now, the workers are using Mao Zedong Thought to guide their management work, eliminating cumbersome rules and regulations, and reforming the management structure. Various functional departments have adopted forms such as service teams and door-to-door delivery to provide services directly at the production site.

Workers say: In the past, production management personnel's minds were filled with parts, numbers, and rules. Now, they are filled with Mao Zedong Thought. In the past, we had to go to them; now, they come to us. This is the kind of service that benefits production!

The workers have proven with irrefutable facts: Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are fearless, daring to think, act, and revolutionize, using their boundless creativity to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced levels. They pool their wisdom and have independently manufactured over 400 specialized equipment this year, many of which are unique and at the world's advanced level.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary spirit of the workers at the First Automobile Works in Changchun is flourishing, and automobile production is booming. This is a batch of "Liberation" heavy-duty trucks ready to be shipped.

    遵照毛主席教导，走我国自己的道路
    革命精神大发扬　汽车生产大发展
    长春汽车厂提前完成今年计划，产量超过去年三分之一
    据新华社长春八日电  第一汽车制造厂广大革命职工，在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，进一步高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，革命精神大发扬，汽车生产大发展。
    到十一月二十五日，这个厂已经提前三十六天超额完成了第三个五年计划第一年国家的汽车生产计划。汽车产量比去年全年产量增加百分之三十六点三，汽车质量稳定提高，成本和原料材料消耗，都比去年显著降低。此外，还试制成功具有国际先进水平的新型“红旗”高级轿车，三种载重汽车，两种越野汽车，两种大客车和六种新型载重汽车用的发动机等新产品。
    长春第一汽车厂在全国无产阶级文化大革命高潮的推动下，在林彪同志号召把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动提高到一个新的阶段的鼓舞下，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动有了新的发展。经过深入学习“老三篇”，职工们站得更高，看得更远了。只要是符合毛泽东思想，对生产有利，对人民有利的事，不管份内份外，就努力用“完全”、“彻底”的革命精神把它做好。反之，只要是不利于生产，不利于群众的东西，就坚决把它破掉。过去这个厂曾经从国外抄来一种名叫“组织设计”的东西。一共六十二大本，一千六百五十万字，条条款款，规定得死死的，长期束缚着职工的革命积极性和创造性。现在职工们努力用毛泽东思想统帅管理工作，砍掉烦琐的规章制度，改革了管理机构，各职能部门都采取派服务队、送货上门等形式，服务到生产现场。
    工人说：过去生产管理人员脑子里装的多是零件、数字、条条框框，现在装上毛泽东思想了。过去是我们找上门，现在是他们送上门，这才是生产的好服务员哪！
    职工们以无可辩驳的事实表明：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，就无所畏惧，敢想、敢干、敢革命，以自己无穷的创造力，赶超世界先进水平。他们群策群力，在今年自制了四百多台专用设备，其中有许多是独创一格，具有世界先进水平。（附图片）
    在毛泽东思想指导下，长春第一汽车制造厂职工革命精神大发扬，汽车生产大发展。这是即将出厂的大批解放牌载重汽车。
