The massive proletarian cultural revolution, under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, has broken through the obstacles of the bourgeois reactionary line and is developing in a deeper and broader direction. An important feature of the current situation is that the broad masses of revolutionary workers have risen to participate in the proletarian cultural revolution. Revolutionary students are uniting with the masses of workers, marking a new beginning.

The bourgeois reactionary line, which targets the proletarian revolutionary line led by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, has been exposed by the broad revolutionary masses. Some comrades who have implemented the wrong line are correcting their mistakes and returning to the correct line. The extremely small number of people who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line are becoming increasingly isolated. The ranks of the revolutionary left have greatly expanded, strengthened, and improved.

The broad revolutionary masses are sweeping away all obstacles and advancing in big strides along the path of the proletarian cultural revolution opened up by Chairman Mao.

A small handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and the extremely small number of people who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line, are not reconciled to their failure. They have misjudged the situation. They are still playing new tricks and adopting new forms to deceive the masses, continuing to resist the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Because the broad revolutionary masses are resolutely opposed to the bourgeois reactionary line, some people with ulterior motives are using the slogan "oppose the bourgeois reactionary line" to deceive and confuse the masses, actually attacking the revolutionary left and shelling the proletarian headquarters. Because the broad revolutionary masses are resolutely opposed to shelling the proletarian headquarters, some people with ulterior motives are using the slogan "oppose shelling the proletarian headquarters" to oppose the revolutionary masses, suppress the revolutionary masses, and block the masses' criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Whether it is genuine criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line or false criticism depends on their actual actions. Some people who have made mistakes in their line have not made serious and public self-criticisms and are unwilling to rehabilitate those who were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," "anti-Party elements," and other such terms during the cultural revolution. They are still using both hard and soft tactics to deal with the masses, continuing to organize those who have been deceived by them to attack the revolutionary left. They distort right and wrong, attempting to place the blame for the bourgeois reactionary line on the proletarian revolutionary faction, protecting themselves and protecting the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road. Such people, as Lu Xun said, are "using a big flag as a tiger's skin, wrapping themselves in it to scare others."

Our Party absolutely does not allow anyone to use the name of "opposing the bourgeois reactionary line" to attack revolutionary masses or shell the proletarian headquarters.

What is the proletarian headquarters? It is those who firmly support Chairman Mao, firmly support Mao Zedong Thought, firmly implement the correct line of the proletarian cultural revolution represented by Chairman Mao, firmly support the "Sixteen Points" of the proletarian cultural revolution, firmly oppose counter-revolutionary revisionism, and firmly oppose the bourgeois reactionary line.

The direction of the struggle is a major principle issue, a matter of principle for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. If the direction of the struggle is not aimed at the small handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, but at the revolutionary left, and if they deceive and mislead some of the masses to protect themselves and incite the masses to fight each other, this is a typical manifestation of the bourgeois reactionary line. Regardless of the form taken, whether sending work teams or not sending work teams, or withdrawing work teams, as long as such a reactionary policy and reactionary line are implemented, it is a mistake of the bourgeois reactionary line. The issue is not the form of the work teams, but the policy and line implemented. Some units did not send work teams, but were led by the original leaders and still made mistakes. Some work teams implemented Chairman Mao's correct policy and line and did not make mistakes.

Is a headquarters that oppresses the masses a proletarian headquarters? Can it not be "shelled"?

Our Party absolutely does not allow anyone to use the name of "opposing shelling the proletarian headquarters" to persecute revolutionary masses or suppress the revolution.

At present, the small handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and the extremely small number of people who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line, have a characteristic of operating from behind the scenes, manipulating student organizations and worker organizations that have been deceived by them, sowing discord, creating factions, instigating armed struggles, and even using various illegal means to deal with the revolutionary masses. These people themselves are "sitting on the mountain watching the tigers fight." They mistakenly believe that they can use these methods to sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution.

They think they are clever, but in fact, they are the most foolish. They will definitely lift the stone to hit their own feet. Some of the masses who are temporarily deceived by them will definitely awaken during the proletarian cultural revolution, expose them, and oppose them. The vast majority of the masses are always good and always support the Party and Chairman Mao. Once the masses recognize the true face of the small handful of conspirators and tricksters who oppose the proletarian cultural revolution, they will immediately spit them out and stand on the correct line of the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us to engage in ideological struggle, not armed struggle. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and firmly implement this policy. Insisting on ideological struggle and firmly opposing armed struggle is a very important policy of the proletarian cultural revolution. This policy is beneficial to the proletariat and to the revolutionary masses. Only by insisting on ideological struggle and firmly opposing the bad elements who incite armed struggle between the masses can we ensure the realization of great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, ensure the normal conduct of great debates, big-character posters, and great criticism, and protect the democratic rights of the people.

The small handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and the extremely small number of people who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line, deliberately create incidents and instigate armed struggles, in order to sabotage the democratic rights of the people, attempt to sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat, and sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution. All revolutionary masses and revolutionary organizations must be vigilant and not be deceived. If there are different opinions, they should be discussed through presenting facts and reasoning, uniting under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and on the basis of the "Sixteen Points" of the cultural revolution, to work together to carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

Comrades who made mistakes in their line in the previous stage must seriously correct their mistakes, completely draw a clear line with the wrong line, and return to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

To seriously correct mistakes, one must:

1. Sincerely and honestly make self-criticisms to the masses;
2. For those who were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," "anti-Party elements," "fake leftists, true rightists," "extortionists," and other such terms during the cultural revolution because they criticized the leadership, they must be genuinely rehabilitated and their reputations restored;
3. For the masses and cadres who were deceived by the wrong line, political and ideological work must be done, taking responsibility oneself instead of pushing the mistakes onto the masses or subordinates, using one's own experience of making mistakes to help them improve their understanding, and uniting with the broad masses;
4. Go to the masses, learn from the masses, be a small student of the masses, and together with the masses criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, eliminating the bad influence caused by the bourgeois reactionary line;
5. In actual actions, not just in words, implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, firmly support the revolutionary left, rely on the broad masses, and firmly strike at the small handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

We believe that the broad revolutionary masses are reasonable and seek truth from facts. Comrades who made mistakes in their line in the previous stage, as long as they do the above, can gain the understanding of the broad revolutionary masses, regain the trust of the masses, turn passive into active, and do a good job in the proletarian cultural revolution and other work.

If they do not do this but continue down the wrong path, they will inevitably be overthrown.

Since the large-scale proletarian cultural revolution in our country began half a year ago, it has achieved great successes and created rich experiences. Every revolutionary can gain great enlightenment from it. Lenin said: "In a revolutionary period, what thousands and tens of thousands of people learn in a week is more than what they learn in a year of muddled life. Because when the life of the entire people undergoes a sharp change, one can particularly clearly see what class has what purpose, how much power they have, and what means they use to act." We must take Chairman Mao's correct line as our guide, take class struggle as the key link, and use the method of class analysis to study various phenomena, analyze the trends of various classes in the current cultural revolution, and study the means they use to act.

The proletarian revolutionary faction should further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, strengthen and improve the leadership core, and further improve the art of struggle. They should strengthen investigation and research, grasp policies, pay attention to work methods, be good at presenting facts and reasoning, be good at consulting and discussing with masses who hold different opinions, be good at uniting the broad masses, and welcome comrades who have made mistakes in their line to correct their mistakes. Only in this way can we maximize the exposure and isolation of the small handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road, organize a vast army of the proletarian cultural revolution, seize new victories, and complete the great historical task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao.

    夺取新的胜利
    ——《红旗》杂志一九六六年第十五期社论
    规模巨大的无产阶级文化大革命运动，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，冲破资产阶级反动路线的阻碍，向着更深入、更广阔的方面发展。目前形势的一个重要特点，就是广大的革命工人群众起来投入了无产阶级文化大革命运动，革命的学生同工人群众相结合，出现了新的开端。
    以反对毛主席为首的党中央的无产阶级革命路线为目标的资产阶级反动路线，已经被广大革命群众所识破。一些执行过错误路线的同志正在改正自己的错误，回到正确的路线上来。极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，越来越孤立了。革命左派的队伍，有了很大的发展、壮大和提高。
    广大革命群众，正在扫除一切绊脚石，沿着毛主席亲手开辟的无产阶级文化大革命的道路，大踏步地前进。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，并不甘心自己的失败。他们错误地估计了形势。他们还在玩弄新的花样，采取新的形式来欺骗群众，继续对抗以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。因为广大革命群众是坚决反对资产阶级反动路线的，有些别有用心的人，也就利用“反对资产阶级反动路线”这一个口号招摇撞骗，混淆视听，他们实际上是攻击革命左派，炮打无产阶级司令部。因为广大革命群众是坚决反对炮打无产阶级司令部的，有些别有用心的人，也就利用“反对炮打无产阶级司令部”这一个口号，来反对革命群众，压制革命群众，阻挡群众对资产阶级反动路线的批判。
    是真批判资产阶级反动路线，还是假批判资产阶级反动路线，要看他们的实际行动。有些人犯了路线错误，他们并没有做认真的公开的检讨，不肯给那些在文化革命中被他们打成“反革命”、“反党分子”的革命群众平反。他们还采取软硬兼施的办法对付群众，继续组织被他们蒙蔽的群众，来打击革命左派。他们颠倒是非，妄图把资产阶级反动路线的罪名加在无产阶级革命派的头上，包庇他们自己，包庇走资本主义道路的当权派。这种人，正像鲁迅所说的那样，他们是“拉大旗作为虎皮，包着自己，去吓呼别人”。
    我们党，绝对不允许任何人假借“反对资产阶级反动路线”的名义，来打击革命群众，来炮打无产阶级司令部。
    什么叫无产阶级司令部？就是坚决拥护毛主席、坚决拥护毛泽东思想的，坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级文化大革命正确路线、坚决拥护无产阶级文化大革命十六条的，坚决反对反革命修正主义的，坚决反对资产阶级反动路线的。
    斗争的矛头对准什么，这是个大是大非的问题，这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的原则问题。斗争的矛头不是指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，而是指向革命左派，并且欺骗和蒙蔽一部分群众来保自己，挑动群众斗群众，这是资产阶级反动路线的典型表现。不管采取什么形式，派工作组也好，不派工作组也好，撤了工作组也好，只要是采取这样的反动方针和反动政策，就是犯了资产阶级反动路线的错误。问题不在工作组这个形式，而在于实行什么方针，什么政策。有些单位并没有派工作组，由原来的负责人领导，也同样犯了错误。有一部分工作组采取了实行了毛主席的正确方针和政策，并没有犯错误。
    那种压迫群众的司令部，难道是无产阶级的司令部吗？难道不可以“炮轰”吗？
    我们党，绝对不允许任何人假借“反对炮打无产阶级司令部”的名义，来整革命群众，来压制革命。
    现在，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，有一个特点，就是自己在幕后，操纵受他们蒙蔽的学生群众组织、工人群众组织，挑拨离间，制造宗派，挑起武斗，甚至使用各种非法手段，来对付革命群众。这些人自己则“坐山观虎斗”。他们妄图用这种手法破坏无产阶级文化大革命。
    他们这样做，自以为得计，其实是最愚蠢的。他们一定会搬起石头砸自己的脚。暂时受他们蒙蔽的一些群众，在无产阶级文化大革命的过程中，一定会觉悟起来，揭发他们，反对他们。群众的绝大多数总是好的，总是拥护党、拥护毛主席的。暂时受蒙蔽的群众，一旦认清了那一小撮玩阴谋、耍诡计，反对无产阶级文化大革命的人的真面目，就立即会唾弃他们，站到以毛主席为首的党中央的正确路线一边来。
    毛主席教导我们，要文斗，不要武斗。我们要听毛主席的话，坚决按照毛主席的这个指示办事。坚持文斗，不许武斗，是无产阶级文化大革命的一项极其重要的政策。这个政策对无产阶级有利，对革命群众有利。只有坚持文斗，坚决反对坏人挑动群众之间进行武斗，才能保证实现无产阶级专政下的大民主，才能保证大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的正常进行，才能保护人民群众的民主权利。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，故意制造事件，挑动武斗，就是为了破坏人民群众的民主权利，妄图破坏无产阶级专政，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。一切革命群众和革命组织，都要提高警惕，不要上当。有不同意见，要用摆事实、讲道理的方法进行讨论，在毛泽东思想伟大旗帜下，在文化革命十六条的基础上团结起来，同心协力，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在前一阶段犯过路线错误的同志，必须认真改正错误，彻底同错误路线划清界线，回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    认真改正错误，就要：（一）诚恳地老老实实地向群众作检讨；（二）对在文化大革命运动中因为批评领导而被打成“反革命”、“反党分子”、“假左派、真右派”、“伸手派”等等的革命群众，实行真正平反，给他们恢复名誉；（三）对受错误路线蒙蔽的群众和干部，要做政治思想工作，要自己承担责任，而不是把错误推给群众、推给下级，要用自己犯错误的切身体会，帮助他们提高认识，同广大群众团结起来；（四）到群众中去，向群众学习，当群众的小学生，同群众一起批判资产阶级反动路线，清除资产阶级反动路线造成的恶劣影响；（五）在实际行动上而不是口头上执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决地支持革命左派，依靠广大群众，坚决打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    我们相信广大革命群众，是通情达理的，实事求是的。在前一阶段犯过路线错误的同志，只要做到以上几点，就能够获得广大革命群众的谅解，重新获得群众的信任，就能够变被动为主动，就能够做好无产阶级文化大革命的工作和其他各项工作。
    如果不是这样，而是继续沿着错误路线走下去，那就非垮台不可。
    我国的无产阶级文化革命大规模地开展以来，已经半年了。在这半年当中，获得了极大的成绩，创造了丰富的经验，每个革命者都可以从中获得极大的教益。列宁说：“在革命时期千百万人民一个星期内学到的东西，比他们平常在一年糊涂的生活中所学到的还要多。因为当全体人民的生活发生急剧转变时，可以特别清楚地看出什么阶级抱有什么目的，他们拥有多大的力量，他们采用什么手段进行活动。”我们要以毛主席的正确路线为指南，以阶级斗争为纲，用阶级分析的方法，去研究各种现象，分析当前文化大革命中各阶级的动向，研究他们采用什么手段进行活动。
    无产阶级革命派，应该进一步活学活用毛主席著作，加强和提高领导核心，进一步提高斗争的艺术。要加强调查研究，掌握政策，注意工作方法，善于摆事实、讲道理，善于和持有不同意见的群众商量，讨论问题，善于团结广大群众，要欢迎犯过路线错误的同志改正错误。这样，才能最大限度地暴露和孤立一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，才能组织起浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，夺取新的胜利，完成毛主席交给我们的伟大的历史任务。
