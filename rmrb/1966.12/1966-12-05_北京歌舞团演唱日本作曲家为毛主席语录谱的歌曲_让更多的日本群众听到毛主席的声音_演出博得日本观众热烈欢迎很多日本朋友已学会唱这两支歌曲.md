The Beijing Song and Dance Troupe, currently performing in various parts of Japan, enthusiastically sang two songs composed by Japanese musician Munekazu Munekata based on Chairman Mao's quotations. The performances were warmly received by the Japanese audience.

The two quotations by Chairman Mao are:
	“Only the people, and not the individual, are the creators of world history.”
	“In times of difficulty, our comrades must see achievements, see the light, and boost our morale.”

The audience commented: The fact that a Japanese musician composed music for the great Chairman Mao's quotations and that Chinese singers performed these songs in Japan, itself best reflects the boundless love and deep friendship between the peoples of the two countries for Chairman Mao.

The music for these two quotations was composed by Munekazu Munekata in early October this year while he was in China. At that time, he was the deputy leader of the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe visiting China. In early November, after the delegation returned to Japan from China, they handed over the two musical scores to the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe, which was then visiting Japan. The leaders and members of the troupe were deeply moved by the Japanese friends' boundless love and respect for Chairman Mao and decided to perform these two songs as part of their official repertoire for the Japanese audience. The members immediately began practicing during their travels.

In mid-November, after the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe returned to Tokyo from performances in other cities, they first sang the two songs they had practiced for the composer Munekazu Munekata, seeking his opinions. Munekazu Munekata was deeply moved and said: The Chinese singers, through their performances, allow more Japanese people to hear Chairman Mao's voice. This is a great encouragement to me personally and to Japanese musicians. He also praised the Chinese performers, saying that they fully expressed the boundless love and respect for Chairman Mao that he intended to convey through these two songs.

On November 25, the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe performed these two songs for over 2,000 audience members in Tokyo with deep emotion, receiving enthusiastic praise.

In recent days, during small-scale performances at the China Economic and Trade Exhibition venue, the troupe sang these two songs at every performance, each time receiving a warm welcome. When the Chinese performers sang in Japanese, some Japanese audience members who remembered Chairman Mao's quotations also joined in singing. Many Japanese friends have already learned these two songs.

    让更多的日本群众听到毛主席的声音
    演出博得日本观众热烈欢迎很多日本朋友已学会唱这两支歌曲
    新华社四日讯　东京消息：正在日本各地演出的中国北京歌舞团，热情演唱日本作曲家宗像和为毛主席的两段语录谱成的两支歌曲，受到日本观众的热烈欢迎。
    毛主席的这两段语录是：
      “人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
      “我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”
    观众说：日本的作曲家为伟大的毛主席的语录谱曲，中国歌唱家在日本演唱这两首歌曲，这件事本身，最好地反映了日中两国人民对毛主席的无比热爱和两国人民无比友好的感情。
    毛主席这两段语录的曲子，是宗像和今年十月上旬在中国创作的。他当时是松山芭蕾舞团访华代表团的副团长。十一月初，代表团从中国回到日本后，把这两份曲谱送给了正在日本访问的北京歌舞团。歌舞团的领导和团员，都为日本朋友无限热爱和敬仰毛主席而深深感动，决定把这两支歌曲作为歌舞团的正式节目向日本观众演唱。团员们马上抓紧时间，在旅行途中进行练习。
    十一月中旬，北京歌舞团从外地演出回到东京以后，首先把练好的这两支歌曲唱给作曲家宗像和听，征求他的意见。宗像和非常感动地说：中国的歌唱家通过自己的演出，让更多的日本群众听到毛主席的声音，这是对我本人极大的鼓励，也是对日本音乐家的鼓励。他还称赞演唱这两支歌曲的中国演员，充分地表达了他创作这两支歌曲时，所要表现的对毛主席的无限热爱和敬仰的感情。
    十一月二十五日，中国北京歌舞团在东京第一次感情充沛地向两千多名观众演唱了这两支歌曲，博得了观众的热情赞扬。
    最近几天，北京歌舞团在中国经济贸易展览会会场进行小型演出时，场场演唱这两支歌曲，每次都受到热烈欢迎。当中国演员用日文演唱时，有一些记住毛主席的这两段语录的日本观众也随着学唱。许多日本朋友已经学会了这两支歌曲。
