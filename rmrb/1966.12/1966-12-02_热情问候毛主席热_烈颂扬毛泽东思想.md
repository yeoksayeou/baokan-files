The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently received a letter from the Communist Party of Brazil. The letter enthusiastically praises Mao Zedong Thought and the firm stance of the Chinese people in opposing U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism.

The letter was adopted by the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of Brazil. It states: "The Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of Brazil extends its warmest and most admiring greetings to the heroic Communist Party of China and its tried-and-true leader, Chairman Mao Zedong."

The letter says: "The unyielding stance of the Chinese Communist Party in opposing U.S. imperialists and their uncompromising struggle against modern revisionism have won the enthusiastic support of the peoples of various countries. At present, the glorious Chinese people, with a fearless spirit, are accepting the challenge of the warmongers of the United States, setting a great example, winning the sympathy of the workers and the masses, and inspiring their fighting spirit. China has become the strongest base of the world revolutionary movement. The Chinese revolution, faithful to the principles of the great October Socialist Revolution, opened a new stage in the struggle for liberation of the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America with its victory in 1949."

The letter emphasizes: "The outstanding experience of the Chinese comrades and Mao Zedong Thought have enriched Marxism-Leninism and are an inexhaustible source of lessons and a source of strength for people to oppose the most vicious enemy of humanity, U.S. imperialism."

The letter says: "The Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of Brazil, representing the deepest aspirations of the Brazilian people, has raised high the banner of national independence and is determined to spare no effort in the struggle against the American aggressors. The communists of our country are striving to promote the unity of patriotic democratic forces to liberate our country from dictatorial rule and to pave the way for the establishment of a progressive and free system that guarantees the peasants' land, the workers' happiness, and the complete liberation of Brazil from the American yoke. The Sixth Congress decided to continue to strengthen the struggle against modern revisionism and calls on all party members to fulfill their duty of strengthening the party so that it can play its role as the vanguard of the revolution."

The letter says: "The Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of Brazil, through the unanimous voice of its representatives, warmly reaffirms the friendship that binds the communists of Brazil to the communists of China. This friendship is strengthening in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism. No force can sever the bond of unity between our two parties."

The letter concludes: "Long live the unity of the peoples of all countries against the American aggressors and their lackeys! Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of Brazil!"
