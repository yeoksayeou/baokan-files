The Iraq Petroleum Company, which is owned by capital from the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands, has its headquarters in London. It extracts oil in northern Iraq and transports it through two pipelines to the ports of Syria and Lebanon on the eastern Mediterranean, from where it is shipped to Europe. The pipeline that runs across the entire territory of Syria to the port of Baniyas is over three hundred miles long and is responsible for transporting three-fifths of the company's total oil. For many years, the Iraq Petroleum Company has been falsifying accounts and embezzling a large amount of transit taxes that should have been paid to Syria. For this reason, the Syrian government began negotiations with this company starting in September of this year. Due to the company's use of delaying tactics, the negotiations finally broke down in late November.

    “伊拉克石油公司”
    美、英、法、荷资本拥有的“伊拉克石油公司”，总部设在伦敦。它在伊拉克北部开采的石油，通过两条油管输送到叙利亚和黎巴嫩在东地中海的港口，从那里装船运往欧洲。横贯叙利亚全境到达巴尼亚斯港的油管全长三百多英里，它负担输送这家公司全部石油的五分之三。“伊拉克石油公司”多年来一贯伪造账目，侵吞了应该付给叙利亚的大量过境税。为此，叙利亚政府从今年九月起曾同这家公司进行谈判。由于这家公司采取拖延手法，谈判终于在十一月下旬宣告破裂。
