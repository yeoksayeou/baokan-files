The motherland is our strongest support, and Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. Whenever the struggle is at its toughest, we think of the motherland and Chairman Mao, and we are filled with confidence to press forward bravely! We will definitely use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon to achieve final victory in this international class struggle!

	New China News Agency, December 8th: Forty-one overseas Chinese youth in an Indonesian prison wrote a letter to the dearest leader Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the motherland. The full text is as follows:

	Dear Motherland, Party Central Committee, and our dearest leader Chairman Mao:

	Greetings! We, forty-one overseas Chinese youth unjustly imprisoned in the Medan base command in Indonesia, are writing to you. To defend the dignity and honor of the motherland and to fight for the legal rights of overseas Chinese, we have been unjustly arrested by Indonesian right-wing soldiers. In our struggle against the enemy, you are the red sun in our hearts. Chairman Mao's works have given us boundless strength, enabling us to dare to face all ghosts and demons and decisively defeat them! In the face of the enemy's torture and threats, our patriotic stance and fighting spirit have never wavered, because we have seen through their true nature. Chairman Mao said, "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. On the surface, it seems the reactionaries are terrible, but in reality, they have no real power." We deeply feel the wisdom and correctness of Chairman Mao's words through our struggle. To defend the dignity of the motherland and to protest against the fascist atrocities of Indonesian right-wing soldiers, we carried out a six-day hunger strike. During this time, whenever physical pain and hunger made us dizzy, we seemed to see Chairman Mao by our side, softly saying to us, "Resolve to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." At that moment, we were full of strength, our spirits lifted, and we clenched our teeth to continue the struggle!

	The enemy can beat us until we are covered in blood and injuries, but they cannot shake our love for the motherland and Chairman Mao. The motherland is our strongest support, and Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. Whenever the struggle is at its toughest, we think of the motherland and Chairman Mao, and we are filled with confidence to press forward bravely!

	From the moment of our arrest, we have used Chairman Mao's teachings to encourage and inspire each other. Through the struggle, we deeply feel the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought. In the dark prison cells patrolled by the enemy, comrades, relying on memory, read Chairman Mao's quotations over and over. Although we are in the dark and terrifying prison, the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates our hearts.

	We thank the people of the motherland, the Party Central Committee, and Chairman Mao for their concern and comfort. We will definitely study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, definitely engrave Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, fuse it into our blood, and put it into action. We will definitely learn from the pioneers of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the motherland—the Red Guards' daring to think, speak, act, and rebel spirit of the proletarian revolutionary rebellion. Currently, our struggle with the enemy is still ongoing. We promise Chairman Mao: We will definitely continue to use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon to achieve final victory in this international class struggle!

	With boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, forty-one overseas Chinese youth in the Indonesian prison carefully embroidered a red flag with the words "Long Live Chairman Mao" in gold (top picture). They also made a five-pointed star (bottom picture) in the prison, with Chairman Mao's portrait in the center and forty-one small red stars surrounding it. Each red heart turns to the sun, and the hearts of the overseas Chinese youth forever turn to Chairman Mao.

    四十一名华侨青少年在印度尼西亚狱中
    写给最敬爱的领袖毛主席的信
    祖国是我们最强大的靠山，毛主席是我们心中最红的红太阳。每当斗争最艰苦时，想起了祖国，想起了毛主席，我们就充满信心地奋勇前进！我们一定以毛泽东思想为武器，在这场国际阶级斗争中取得最后胜利！
    新华社八日讯　四十一名华侨青少年在印度尼西亚狱中写给最敬爱的领袖毛主席、党中央和祖国的一封信，全文如下：亲爱的祖国、党中央和我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席：
    您好！我们四十一名被无理监禁在印度尼西亚棉兰基地司令部的华侨青少年正给您写信。为了维护祖国的尊严和荣誉，为了争取华侨的合法权益，我们被印度尼西亚右派军人无理逮捕了。在与敌人进行斗争时，您是我们心中的红太阳。毛主席著作给了我们无穷的力量，使我们敢于跟一切牛鬼蛇神进行面对面的斗争，并坚决将它们彻底击败！在敌人严刑拷打和威逼利诱面前，我们的爱国立场和战斗意志不曾动摇过，因为我们看透了他们的本质。毛主席说，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，表面上看来，反动派的样子是可怕的，其实并没有什么了不起的力量。我们从斗争中深深地体会到毛主席这段话的英明伟大和无比正确。为了维护祖国的尊严，为了抗议印度尼西亚右派军人的法西斯暴行，我们进行了六天的绝食斗争。在这期间，每当肉体上的痛苦和饥饿的痛苦把我们折磨得头晕眼花时，我们就仿佛看到毛主席在我们身旁轻声地对我们说道：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这时，我们浑身都是力量，精神振作，咬紧牙关，把斗争继续坚持下去！
    敌人可以把我们打得头破血流，遍体鳞伤，却丝毫也不能动摇我们热爱祖国、热爱毛主席的信念。祖国是我们最强大的靠山，毛主席是我们心中最红的红太阳。每当斗争最艰苦时，想起了祖国，想起了毛主席，我们就充满信心地奋勇前进！
    从我们被捕的那个时刻起，我们就用毛主席的教导来互相勉励，互相鼓舞。从斗争中，我们深刻体会到毛泽东思想的无比威力。在敌人来回巡防的黑暗的囚室里，同志们凭着记忆，把毛主席语录一遍又一遍地朗读。虽然我们身在阴森恐怖的牢房里，可是毛泽东思想的光辉却照亮了我们的心。
    感谢祖国人民，感谢党中央和毛主席对我们的关怀和慰问。我们一定要更努力地学习毛主席著作，一定要把毛泽东思想刻在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实到行动上。一定要学习祖国无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋——红卫兵们敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯的无产阶级革命造反精神。目前，我们与敌人的斗争仍在进行。我们向毛主席保证：我们一定要继续以毛泽东思想为武器，在这场国际阶级斗争中取得最后胜利！

    他们还在狱中制作了一个五角星（下图），中间贴着毛主席像，周围簇拥着四十一颗小红星。颗颗红心向太阳，华侨青少年的红心，永远向着毛主席。　　新华社稿
