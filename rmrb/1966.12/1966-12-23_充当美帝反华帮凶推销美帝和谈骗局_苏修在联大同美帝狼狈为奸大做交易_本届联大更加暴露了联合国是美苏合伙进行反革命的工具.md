The 21st session of the United Nations General Assembly, which began on September 20, concluded on December 20. A prominent feature throughout this session was the close collusion between the representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union, both openly and covertly, using the United Nations as a venue for their dirty political deals more brazenly than ever before.

Even before this session of the UN General Assembly began, the Soviet revisionist leadership had started a new and ferocious anti-China campaign, attacking China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This indicated that they were further tightening their policy of full-scale collaboration with the United States against China. The U.S. ruling class, of course, understood this well. On October 7, U.S. President Johnson delivered a speech advocating U.S.-Soviet "rapprochement," openly expressing support and encouragement for the Soviet Union to move closer to the United States and jointly oppose China. Soon after, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko held several secret talks with Johnson and U.S. Secretary of State Rusk in Washington, setting the tone for this session of the UN General Assembly and laying the groundwork for several dirty deals between the two countries.

In their behind-the-scenes collusion, the primary focus was on plotting the "peace talks" conspiracy to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The Johnson administration urgently needed the help of Soviet leaders to promote the "peace talks" hoax, and the Soviet side was more than willing to oblige, which was no secret.

This session once again showed that the Soviet revisionist leadership, under the banner of "socialist great power," continued to adopt a two-faced approach on the Vietnamese issue: in public and during the sessions, Soviet representatives verbally "condemned" the United States and pretended to "support" the Vietnamese people; in private, they actively provided advice and information to the U.S. aggressors. Gromyko's performance during his participation in the UN General Assembly in September proved this; in early December, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov's activities at the United Nations also proved this; Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations Fedorenko's performance throughout the session similarly proved this.

Moreover, to support the U.S. "peace talks" conspiracy, the Soviet leadership, during this session, instructed some of their followers to actively promote "ceasefire" and "negotiations" both inside and outside the sessions, even spreading the idea of "dividing Vietnam into North and South" and "negotiations do not necessarily require the U.S. to withdraw first." This completely exposed the true face of this group of traitors.

While the Soviet revisionist group was colluding with the United States on the Vietnamese issue, they also went to great lengths to make deals with the United States on the so-called "disarmament" issue. They manipulated the session to pass one resolution after another, advocating "complete disarmament," "preventing nuclear proliferation," "stopping all nuclear tests," and so on. In addition, they also concluded a "treaty on the peaceful use of outer space," which was another shameful surrender and betrayal by the Soviet revisionist leadership to U.S. imperialism since the signing of the 1963 Moscow Three-Nation Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. It was also another hoax jointly created by the U.S. and the Soviet Union in their global collusion.

The U.S. and the Soviet Union's extensive collusion and deals on issues such as Vietnam and "disarmament" were aimed at China, intended to oppose and "isolate" China. This was also evident in the UN General Assembly's debate on the so-called "Chinese representation issue": in the face of the United States and its lackeys' vicious slander of China and their obstruction of the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, the Soviet delegation, before the session voted on this issue, hastily distributed a highly malicious anti-China article from the Moscow Pravda dated November 27 to the representatives of various countries, openly collaborating with the United States to obstruct the restoration of China's legitimate rights.

Under the control of the United States and the joint manipulation of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the United Nations has always been a body that does evil and not good; this session of the United Nations General Assembly was no exception. If it did any "good" at all, it was that this session of the United Nations General Assembly more than any previous session helped the people of the world clearly see how the Soviet modern revisionist leadership colludes with U.S. imperialism, jointly using the United Nations as a venue for their dirty political deals, and see how the "United Nations" has thoroughly degenerated into a tool for the U.S. and the Soviet Union to jointly oppose China, oppose communism, oppose the people, and oppose revolution.

    充当美帝反华帮凶推销美帝和谈骗局
    苏修在联大同美帝狼狈为奸大做交易
    本届联大更加暴露了联合国是美苏合伙进行反革命的工具
    据新华社二十一日讯　本社记者报道：从九月二十日开始的第二十一届联合国大会，已经在十二月二十日收场。贯穿整个这次会议的一大特点是，美苏两国代表在会上会下、明里暗里紧密勾结，比往年更加露骨地利用联合国作为它们进行肮脏的政治交易的场所。
    早在这届联大开会之前，苏联修正主义领导集团就已经开始大肆攻击中国的无产阶级文化大革命，掀起一股新的、猖狂的反华浪潮。这意味着，它要进一步加紧推行全面的联美反华的叛卖投降政策。这一点，美国统治集团当然是心领神会的。美国总统约翰逊十月七日发表的一篇鼓吹美苏“和解”的演说，露骨地表示支持和鼓励苏联进一步向美国靠拢、共同反华。紧接着，苏联外长葛罗米柯同约翰逊和美国国务卿腊斯克在华盛顿几度密谈，为这届联大定下了基调，为两国间几笔肮脏交易的成交打下了基础。
    在它们的幕后勾结中，居首要地位的是策划“和谈”阴谋，以扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争的烈火。约翰逊政府急需苏联领导人帮助推销“和谈”骗局，而苏联方面也十分乐意效劳，这早已不是什么秘密。
    这次会议再次表明，打着“社会主义大国”旗号的苏联修正主义领导集团在越南问题上继续采取假支持、真出卖的两面派手法：在会上，在公开场合，苏联代表口头上“谴责”美国几句，装模作样地表示“支持”越南人民；而在私下，则积极为美国侵略者出谋献策、通风报信。九月间，葛罗米柯参加联大时的表现证明了这一点；十二月初，苏联副外长库兹涅佐夫去联合国活动时也证明了这一点；苏联驻联合国常任代表费德林在整个会议期间的表现同样证明了这一点。
    不仅如此，苏联领导人为了配合美国的“和谈”阴谋，在本届大会期间，还指使他们的某些追随者出面，在会上会下大肆鼓吹“停火”“谈判”，甚至散布越南南北“分治”以及“谈判不一定要美国先撤军”的论调，从而彻底暴露了这一伙叛徒的真实面目。
    苏联修正主义集团在越南问题上同美国勾勾搭搭的同时，在所谓“裁军”问题上也千方百计地同美国大搞交易。它们操纵大会通过了一项又一项的“决议”，鼓吹“全面裁军”，“防止核扩散”，“停止一切核试验”等等。此外，它们还搞成了一项“和平利用外层空间条约”，这是一九六三年签订莫斯科三国部分禁止核试验条约以来，苏联修正主义领导集团向美帝国主义作出的又一次可耻的投降和叛卖，也是美苏在全球大勾结中合伙制造的又一个骗局。
    美苏在越南和“裁军”等问题上大肆勾结，大作交易，它们的矛头是针对中国的，是为了反对和“孤立”中国，这在联大辩论所谓中国代表权问题上也表现了出来：在美国及其仆从大肆诋毁中国、多方阻挠恢复中国人民在联合国的合法权利的情况下，苏联代表团在大会就这个问题进行表决之前，匆匆向各国代表团散发了莫斯科《真理报》十一月二十七日的一篇极其恶毒的反华文章，明目张胆地配合美国阻挠恢复中国合法权利。
    在美国控制下和美苏联合操纵下的联合国，从来是尽干坏事、不作好事的；这一届联合国大会更不例外，如果说也作了点什么“好事”的话，那就是，这一届联合国大会比以前任何一届都更加有力地帮助世界人民看清楚苏联现代修正主义领导集团如何同美帝国主义狼狈为奸，共同利用联合国作为它们进行肮脏的政治交易的场所，看清楚“联合国”是怎样彻头彻尾地堕落成为美苏两国合伙反华、反共、反人民、反革命的工具。
