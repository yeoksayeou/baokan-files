The Dongmen Brigade of Fencheng Commune in Shanghai's Fengxian County recently held a study class on the works of Chairman Mao, making the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works more vigorous and solid.

Currently, the entire brigade has one central study class, with each production team having its own study class. According to the cultural level of the commune members, they are divided into three classes. At present, the number of people participating in the study accounts for more than 90% of the labor force in the brigade. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, when the study classes are in session, lights shine brightly everywhere, and the sound of reading fills the air as people read Chairman Mao's books and copy quotations from Chairman Mao.

The study class on the works of Chairman Mao focuses on the "Three Articles" and relevant passages from the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The primary school and junior high school classes also systematically study the "Selected Works of Chairman Mao" Volume B and Volume A, respectively. The study classes are led by the brigade party branch, with the full-time deputy political instructor of the brigade and the political instructors of each production team taking charge. The Communist Youth League branch selects young people with knowledge to serve as study guides. All cadres participate in the study classes, take the lead in studying, and guide the commune members in their studies. To ensure that commune members with children can study with peace of mind, they also set up temporary nurseries in the evenings.

    扎扎实实把学习班组织起来
    上海市奉贤县奉城公社东门大队，最近举办毛主席著作学习班，使活学活用毛主席著作群众运动开展得更加蓬蓬勃勃、扎扎实实。
    现在，全大队有一个中心学习班，每个生产队各有一个学习班，按照社员文化水平，分三个班级。目前参加学习的人数，占在队劳动力的百分之九十以上。每逢星期一、三、五，学习班上课时，各处灯光闪闪，书声琅琅，人们都在读毛主席的书，抄写毛主席语录。
    毛主席著作学习班以“老三篇”和《毛主席语录》中的有关段落为主要学习内容；高小班和初中班还要分别系统地学习《毛主席著作选读》乙种本和甲种本。学习班由大队党支部统一领导，大队专职的副政治指导员和各生产队的政治指导员具体负责，团支部选派知识青年担任学习辅导工作。所有干部都参加学习班，带头学习，并辅导社员学习。为了保证有小孩子的社员能够安心学习，他们还办了夜晚临时托儿所。
