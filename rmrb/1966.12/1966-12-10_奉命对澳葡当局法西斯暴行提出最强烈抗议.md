	The Guangdong Provincial People's Committee's Foreign Affairs Office Director Issues a Statement Firmly Supporting the Just Actions of Macao Compatriots
	Strongest Protest Against the Fascist Atrocities of the Portuguese Authorities in Macao
	Warning: The Portuguese Authorities Must Immediately Accept and Fully Implement All Serious Demands from the Chinese Side
	The Chinese people armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong are not to be trifled with, and the Chinese residents of Macao are absolutely not to be bullied. If you attempt to use the Chiang bandits and American and British imperialism to interfere in Macao affairs, the Chinese people will absolutely not tolerate it.

	New China News Agency, Guangzhou, December 9th: The Director of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee's Foreign Affairs Office issued a statement today, strongly protesting the fascist atrocities of the Portuguese authorities in Macao, expressing that the Chinese people firmly support the just actions of the patriotic compatriots in Macao, and pointing out that the Portuguese authorities in Macao must immediately accept and fully implement all serious demands from the Chinese side. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	On November 15, 1966, the Portuguese authorities in Macao, in order to sabotage the construction of a school by the Chinese residents of Taipa, dispatched a large number of police and plainclothes personnel to brutally suppress the Chinese residents of Taipa, injuring more than forty people and detaining fourteen of them. The Chinese residents of Taipa self-financed the reconstruction of school buildings to solve the problem of their children's education, which is an irreproachable and legitimate act. The Portuguese authorities' hostile attitude towards this is completely unreasonable.

	After the incident on November 15, the Chinese residents of Taipa sent representatives to negotiate with the Portuguese authorities in Macao on multiple occasions and submitted five reasonable demands on November 18. The Portuguese authorities in Macao not only refused to accept them but also distorted the facts, claiming that the Taipa incident was a "premeditated riot" and that the police suppression was "completely legal."

	On December 3, the patriotic students in Macao, unable to bear it any longer, sent representatives to protest to the Portuguese authorities in Macao, reiterating the demand to accept the five demands of the Taipa residents. The Portuguese authorities in Macao used extremely despicable means, luring the patriotic student representatives into the "Governor's Mansion," locking the doors, and beating them; at the same time, they mobilized a large number of soldiers, police, armored vehicles, and tanks to shoot and spray bullets at Chinese shops, residences, and residents, causing a large-scale massacre of Chinese residents unprecedented in scale. The shooting of Chinese residents continued until the 5th, and a white terror enveloped Macao. According to incomplete statistics, 30 to 40 people were killed or injured in the two days, of whom 8 were already dead.

	During the Portuguese authorities in Macao's bloody massacre of Chinese residents, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and American and British imperialism maliciously slandered the just actions of the Chinese residents of Macao and strongly supported the Portuguese authorities in Macao's bloody atrocities.

	Now, the Portuguese authorities in Macao are trying to evade responsibility by pretending to accept the demands of the Chinese residents of Taipa, which is a trick and is absolutely unacceptable. The Guangdong Provincial People's Committee's Foreign Affairs Office, on orders, strongly protests the fascist atrocities of the Portuguese authorities in Macao. The Chinese people firmly support the just actions of the patriotic compatriots in Macao. The Portuguese authorities in Macao must:

	1. Immediately and unconditionally accept the five demands submitted by the Chinese residents of Taipa on November 18;
	2. Immediately and unconditionally accept the five demands submitted by the Macao Federation of Chinese Students on December 5;
	3. Immediately apologize to the Chinese residents and severely punish the main culprits: Army Commander Schwenke, Police Chief Fucil, Deputy Police Chief Enden, and Acting Director of the Islands Administration Office Ong Tek Tek;
	4. Effectively guarantee that Chiang's special agents will not be allowed to carry out any activities in Macao in the future, and immediately hand over the seven Chiang special agents seized by the Portuguese authorities in Macao in June 1963 when they intruded into Chinese waters to the Chinese government for handling.

	The Portuguese authorities in Macao must be sternly warned that the Chinese people armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong are not to be trifled with, and the Chinese residents living in Macao are absolutely not to be bullied. The Portuguese authorities in Macao must immediately accept and fully implement all serious demands from the Chinese side. If you attempt to use the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and American and British imperialism to interfere in Macao affairs, the Chinese people will absolutely not tolerate it.

	(Editor's note by New China News Agency: The five demands submitted by the residents of Taipa, Macao, on November 18, 1966, are:

	1. The Portuguese authorities in Macao must severely punish the culprits who caused this bloody incident.
	2. The Portuguese authorities in Taipa, Macao, cannot obstruct our repair of school buildings and education, nor infringe upon the residents' legitimate rights.
	3. The Portuguese authorities in Taipa, Macao, and the Portuguese police in Macao must be responsible for compensating the medical expenses of the injured and all losses caused by this incident.
	4. We protest against the unreasonable detention and sentencing of our representatives by the Portuguese Judicial Police Department, and the Judicial Police Department should revoke this unreasonable sentence.
	5. The Portuguese authorities in Macao must guarantee that there will be no similar incidents of beating residents in the future.

	The five demands submitted by the Macao Federation of Chinese Students on December 5, 1966, are:

	1. Fully accept and implement the five demands submitted by the residents of Taipa.
	2. Punish the main culprit, Fucil, who commanded the suppression of our patriotic students.
	3. Immediately stop the crime of shooting and spraying bullets at our compatriots in Macao.
	4. Be responsible for compensating all losses to the victims.
	5. Guarantee that there will be no more brutal suppression of our compatriots in Macao in the future.)

    广东省人委外事处长发表声明坚决支持澳门同胞正义行动
    奉命对澳葡当局法西斯暴行提出最强烈抗议
    警告澳葡当局必须立即接受并完全实现中国方面的一切严正要求
    用伟大的毛泽东思想武装的中国人民是不好惹的，澳门的中国居民是绝对不容欺负的。如果你们企图利用蒋匪帮、美英帝国主义干预澳门事务，中国人民是绝对不能容忍的。
    新华社广州九日电广东省人民委员会外事处处长今天发表声明，对澳门葡萄牙当局的法西斯暴行提出最强烈的抗议，表示中国人民坚决支持澳门爱国同胞的正义行动，指出澳葡当局必须立即接受并完全实现中国方面提出的一切严正要求。声明全文如下：
    一九六六年十一月十五日，澳门葡萄牙当局为了破坏澳门凼仔地区中国居民的建校工程，竟然派出大批警察和便衣人员，对凼仔中国居民进行粗暴的镇压，打伤四十多人，扣押其中十四人。澳门凼仔地区中国居民自筹经费改建校舍，解决子女入学问题，是无可指责的正当行为。葡萄牙当局对此采取敌视态度，是毫无道理的。
    十一月十五日事件发生后，凼仔中国居民多次派出代表向澳葡当局进行交涉，并于十一月十八日提出五项合理要求。澳门葡萄牙当局不但拒不接受，反而歪曲事实，说什么凼仔事件是凼仔居民的“预谋暴动”，澳门警察的镇压是“完全合法的”。
    十二月三日，澳门爱国师生忍无可忍，派出代表向澳门葡萄牙当局提出严重抗议，重申要求接受凼仔居民的五项要求。澳门葡萄牙当局采取极为卑劣的手段，诱骗爱国师生代表进入“总督府”，关起门来进行毒打；同时出动大批军警、装甲车和坦克，向中国商店、住宅和居民开枪扫射，造成了空前规模的屠杀中国居民的大惨案。开枪射击中国居民的事件，直至五日还在进行，白色恐怖笼罩着澳门。据不完全统计，三、四两日共死伤一百余人，其中已死八人。
    在澳门葡萄牙当局血腥屠杀中国居民的过程中，蒋介石匪帮和美英帝国主义恣意污蔑澳门中国居民的正义行动，大力支持澳门葡萄牙当局的血腥暴行。
    现在，澳门葡萄牙当局避重就轻，企图用伪装接受凼仔中国居民要求的办法，来逃脱它十二月三日以来大规模屠杀中国居民的严重罪责。这是一个骗局，这是绝对办不到的。广东省人民委员会外事处奉命对澳门葡萄牙当局的法西斯暴行提出最强烈的抗议。中国人民坚决支持澳门爱国同胞的正义行动。澳门葡萄牙当局必须：
    一、立即无条件接受澳门凼仔地区中国居民在十一月十八日提出的五项要求；
    二、立即无条件接受澳门中华学生联合会在十二月五日提出的五项要求；
    三、立即向中国居民赔礼、道歉，并严惩主要肇事者：陆军司令施维纳、警察厅长傅基利、警察厅副厅长颜端尼、代理海岛行政局长晏德地等；
    四、切实保证今后决不允许蒋匪特务在澳门进行任何活动，并把一九六三年六月澳门葡萄牙当局侵入中国水域抢走的七名蒋匪特务立即交还中国政府处理。
    必须严正警告澳门葡萄牙当局，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不好惹的，居住在澳门的中国居民是绝对不容欺负的。澳门葡萄牙当局必须立即接受并完全实现中国方面提出的一切严正要求。如果你们企图利用蒋介石匪帮、美英帝国主义来干预澳门事务，中国人民是绝对不能容忍的。
      （新华社编者按：一九六六年十一月十八日澳门凼仔居民提出的五项要求是：
    一、澳门葡萄牙当局必须严惩制造这次流血事件的肇事人。
    二、澳门葡萄牙凼仔当局不能阻挠我们修理校舍办学、侵犯居民正当权益。
    三、澳门葡萄牙凼仔当局和澳门葡萄牙警方必须负责赔偿受伤者的一切医药费用和因此事件而引起的一切损失。
    四、对澳门葡萄牙司法警察处无理拘捕我代表判刑一事表示抗议，司法警察处应撤销这一无理判决。
    五、澳门葡萄牙当局必须保证今后不再有殴打居民的类似事件发生。
    一九六六年十二月五日澳门中华学生联合会提出的五项要求是：
    一、全部接纳和实现凼仔居民所提出的五项要求。
    二、惩办指挥镇压我爱国师生的主凶傅基利。
    三、立即停止开枪扫射澳门同胞的罪行。
    四、对被害者负责赔偿一切损失。
    五、保证今后不再发生镇压我澳门同胞的残暴行为。）
