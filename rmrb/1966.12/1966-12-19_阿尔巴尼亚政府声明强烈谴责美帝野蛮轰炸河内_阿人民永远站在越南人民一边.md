Albanian Government Statement Strongly Condemns U.S. Imperialist Barbaric Bombing of Hanoi
Albanian People Stand Forever with the Vietnamese People

	New China News Agency, Tirana, December 18 – According to today's newspaper reports from here, the government of the People's Republic of Albania issued a statement on December 17, strongly condemning the U.S. aggressor planes' continuous bombing of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi. The statement pointed out that this is part of a grand conspiracy by U.S. imperialists and their accomplices to force the Vietnamese people into "negotiations" and to abandon their just struggle through pressure and deception. The statement expresses that the Albanian people, as always, will forever stand by the side of the fraternal Vietnamese people. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	The U.S. imperialists have committed new heinous crimes against the Vietnamese people. On December 13 and 14, 1966, the Johnson administration dispatched a large number of aircraft to brutally bomb the urban and suburban areas of Hanoi, causing significant loss of life and property. The repeated bombing of Hanoi and the continuous expansion of aggression have once again proven that U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the freedom of all peoples.

	The U.S. aggressor planes' continuous bombing of Hanoi is part of a grand conspiracy by U.S. imperialists and their accomplices to force the Vietnamese people into "negotiations" and to abandon their just struggle through pressure and deception. Their goal is to spread a atmosphere of panic, attempting to shake the Vietnamese people's iron will to fight to the end and to salvage the U.S.'s heavy failures in South Vietnam.

	The new crimes of the U.S. air pirates have once again exposed the hypocrisy and shamelessness of the Johnson administration's so-called "peace talks." The recent bombing of Hanoi convincingly proves that the propaganda about "ceasefire" and "peace talks" is entirely a deceitful trick to cover up the expansion of aggression. The U.S. not only does not want to end the war in Vietnam but is determined to continue down the mad path of expanding the conflict in Southeast Asia.

	In the aggression war against the Vietnamese people, U.S. imperialists have continuously received support and cooperation from the Khrushchevite revisionists. The escalation of the bombing has made the collaboration between imperialism and modern revisionism even more intense. The frequent visits of U.S. imperialist representatives and their open or secret diplomatic negotiations with modern revisionists are all aimed at deceiving the Vietnamese people and world public opinion, forcing the Vietnamese people to lay down their arms and accept the conditions imposed by the U.S. aggressors, providing them with favorable conditions, and enabling them to implement their plans to wage war against the peace-loving peoples of Asia.

	The U.S. imperialists' pirate air raids and all other barbaric crimes have not only failed to intimidate the heroic Vietnamese people but have instead deepened their hatred for the aggressors and strengthened their confidence in ultimate victory.

	The heroic Vietnamese people, as in the past, will not be deceived by the tricks of their enemies of freedom and independence. They firmly believe that the only correct way to resolve the Vietnamese problem is to realize the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

	The Albanian people are extremely indignant and strongly condemn the new crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in Vietnam. They will, as always, forever stand by the side of the fraternal Vietnamese people.

	The government of the People's Republic of Albania firmly supports the statement issued by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on December 14, 1966, strongly protesting against the U.S. barbaric bombing of Hanoi and all other crimes committed against the Vietnamese people.

	The government of the People's Republic of Albania is convinced that the Vietnamese people will surely achieve final victory and that the U.S. imperialists will suffer a shameful defeat.

    阿尔巴尼亚政府声明强烈谴责美帝野蛮轰炸河内
    阿人民永远站在越南人民一边
    新华社地拉那十八日电　据这里今天报纸报道，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府十七日发表声明，强烈谴责美国强盗飞机连续轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内。声明指出，这是美帝国主义者及其帮凶为用压力和欺骗手段迫使越南人民进行“和谈”和迫使他们放弃自己的正义斗争而策划的大阴谋的组成部分。声明表示，阿尔巴尼亚人民将一如既往，永远站在兄弟的越南人民一边，声明全文如下：
    美帝国主义对越南人民犯下了新的滔天罪行。一九六六年十二月十三日和十四日，约翰逊政府派遣大批飞机，野蛮轰炸河内市区和郊区，造成了生命财产的重大损失。对河内的再次轰炸，激起了阿尔巴尼亚人民和全世界人民的极大愤慨。这次轰炸和不断扩大侵略，再一次证明，美帝国主义是各国人民自由的最凶恶的敌人。
    美国强盗连续轰炸河内，是美帝国主义者及其帮凶为用压力和欺骗手段迫使越南人民进行“和谈”和迫使他们放弃自己的正义斗争而策划的大阴谋的组成部分。他们的目的是为了散布恐慌气氛，企图动摇越南人民决战决胜的钢铁意志，挽救美国在越南南方的惨重失败。
    美国空中强盗的新罪行，也再一次地暴露了约翰逊政府的所谓“和谈”诚意的虚伪和无耻。最近轰炸河内市，令人信服地证明了关于“停火”和“和谈”的宣传完全是蛊惑人心的伎俩，是掩盖扩大侵略的一个骗局。美国不仅不想结束侵越战争，相反，它决计要在把东南亚的冲突扩大的疯狂道路上走下去。
    美帝国主义者在对越南人民进行的侵略战争中，不断得到赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的支持和合作。轰炸的升级使得帝国主义和现代修正主义之间的合作搞得更加一团火热。美帝国主义的代表们的多次奔走以及他们同现代修正主义者的接二连三的公开或秘密的外交谈判，都是为了欺骗越南人民和世界舆论，迫使越南人民放下武器和接受美国所提出的条件，为美国侵略者提供有利的条件，并使他们能放手实施他们对珍视和平的亚洲各国人民进行战争的计划。
    美帝国主义者的强盗空袭和所有其他野蛮罪行，不仅没有吓倒英雄的越南人民和动摇他们为保卫北方、解放南方和统一祖国而进行神圣斗争的决心，而且恰恰相反地加深了他们对侵略者的仇恨，增强了他们对最后胜利的信心。
    英雄的越南人民像过去一样，决不会受他们的自由和独立的敌人的蛊惑人心的伎俩的欺骗，他们深信：解决越南问题的唯一正确的途径，就是实现越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民感到万分愤慨，强烈谴责美帝国主义在越南犯下的新的罪行，他们将一如既往，永远站在兄弟的越南人民一边。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府坚决支持越南民主共和国政府一九六六年十二月十四日的声明，强烈抗议美国野蛮轰炸河内，和对越南人民犯下的所有其他罪行。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府深信，越南人民必将赢得最后胜利，美帝国主义者必将遭到可耻的失败。
