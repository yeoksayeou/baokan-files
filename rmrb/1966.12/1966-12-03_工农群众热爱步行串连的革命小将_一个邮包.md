In the afternoon of November 2, we received a small parcel. Upon opening it, we found a blue plastic-covered notebook with Chairman Mao's inscription: "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng." On the first page of the notebook, it was written:

"To the revolutionary students and teachers of Anzhong, we are very happy to hear that you are preparing to travel on foot to other places for revolutionary linkups. You are indeed revolutionary young people nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. We support your revolutionary actions.... We hope you will record in this notebook how you study Chairman Mao's works and overcome difficulties along the way."

The message was signed: "Descendants of Poor Peasants."

We immediately informed the entire school of red guards and revolutionary students who were ready to depart. The school was in an uproar, with everyone expressing their determination to learn from these "descendants of poor peasants" and successfully complete this long march on foot. Everyone also unanimously requested to find these "descendants of poor peasants" to express our gratitude in person.

To find these "descendants of poor peasants," we went to the local post office, government offices, and factories to inquire; we also wrote about this in the blackboard newspaper. Everyone actively helped us search, and finally, we found these "descendants of poor peasants." It turned out that they were four young female workers from the Anxian County Spinning Mill.

One afternoon, we went to the mill. The mill's comrades told us that these four young female workers studied and worked very well, and some of them were even active members in studying Chairman Mao's works at the county level. Later, we visited these four respectable female workers and had a friendly conversation with them. We expressed our gratitude to them, and they said, "You red guards are not afraid of thousands of rivers and mountains to go on a long march, we workers firmly support you, this small gift is just a token of our workers' goodwill." To express our thanks, we presented them with a golden copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

This small parcel, shining with the light of Mao Zedong Thought, greatly inspired the long march warriors of our school. We know that these four young female workers represent the entire working class. We will definitely temper ourselves well during the long march and use the revolutionary pen to write the history of our red guards' long march in the notebook they gave us.

    工农群众热爱步行串连的革命小将
    一个邮包
    十一月二日下午，我们收到了一个小邮包。打开一看，出现在眼前的是一个蓝色塑料皮的日记本，封面上有毛主席的题词：“向雷锋同志学习”。日记本的第一页上写着：
      “安中的革命师生们，听到你们准备长途步行到外地去进行革命串连的消息，我们非常高兴。你们不愧是毛泽东思想哺育的革命青少年。我们支持你们这种革命行动。……希望你们把沿路怎样学习毛主席著作、怎样克服困难的情况，记在这本日记本上。”
    署名是：“贫农的后代”。
    我们马上把这件事告诉了全校整装待发的红卫兵和革命师生。学校里沸腾起来了，大家纷纷表示一定要向这些“贫农的后代”学习，胜利完成这次徒步长征。大家还一致要求找到这几位“贫农的后代”，当面向他们致谢。
    为了找到这些“贫农的后代”，我们到当地的邮局、机关和工厂去探寻；还把这件事写在黑板报上。人们都积极地帮我们四出打听，最后终于把这些“贫农的后代”找到了。原来她们是安国县纺纱厂的四个青年女工。
    一天下午，我们来到纱厂。工厂的同志告诉我们：这四位青年女工学习、劳动都很好，有的还是县学习毛主席著作积极分子。后来，我们访问了这四位可敬的女工，同她们作了一次亲切的交谈。我们向她们致谢，她们说：“你们红卫兵小将们不怕万水千山去长征，我们工人坚决支持，这点小小的礼物不过是我们工人的一点心意。”为了向她们表示感谢，我们把金光闪闪的《毛主席语录》赠送给她们。
    这个闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的小邮包的故事，给我校的长征战士们以很大的鼓舞。我们知道，这四位青年女工所代表的是整个工人阶级的心意。我们在长征途中一定要好好锻炼自己，并且要用革命的笔，在她们赠送的日记本上，写下我们红小兵的长征史。
