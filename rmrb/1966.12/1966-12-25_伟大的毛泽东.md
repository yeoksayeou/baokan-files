Great Mao Zedong,

Great Chairman Mao, you are the red sun in the hearts of revolutionary people. Great Chairman Mao, you are the beloved leader of the proletarians of all countries, the helmsman of the world revolution. You are a brilliant strategist, undefeated in a hundred battles. You have forged millions of heroic soldiers who are now fighting across five continents and four oceans. You have established the dictatorship of the proletariat, stronger than any iron wall. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that you personally initiated is surging like a tidal wave, and the first volley has shaken the world. You are cultivating the successors of the revolutionary cause, opening new paths for humanity to achieve liberation. Great Chairman Mao, your thoughts are the beacon lighting the people's path forward, stronger than a thousand atomic bombs. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can defeat the imperialist and colonialist wolves. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can smash modern revisionism to smithereens. With Mao Zedong Thought, capitalism cannot be restored, and socialism will never change color. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shines across the five continents and four oceans. Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!
