The great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the great victory of Sino-Japanese friendship

Over 3.7 million Japanese people visited our national economic and trade exhibition

The masses of spectators expressed their love for Chairman Mao and enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 12th, a message from Nagoya: The Chinese economic and trade exhibition, which is shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, successfully concluded on the 11th in Nagoya City. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship.

After being exhibited in Kitakyushu for 21 days, the Chinese economic and trade exhibition began to be exhibited in Nagoya City on November 19 and continued for 22 days. The total number of visitors to the two exhibitions reached over 3.7 million. This figure is more than ten times the number of visitors to the industrial and commercial exhibition held by the modern revisionist clique of the Soviet Union in Osaka not long ago, and it also created a record for the highest number of visitors to international exhibitions held by various countries in Japan.

Even before the exhibition was held, a small group of followers of Soviet modern revisionism claimed that without their "organizational mobilization," the number of visitors would be at most only 50,000. However, the facts were so cruel to them that this group of miserable "prophets" was completely bankrupt.

This exhibition, held during the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, received enthusiastic support from the broad masses of the Japanese people from all walks of life. Datada Masatoshi of the Hyogo Prefectural Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) said that through the exhibition, the Japanese people have come to understand more deeply the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao. Ebirara Takamitsu from Tokyo wrote in the visitor's book: "Long live the victory of the Cultural Revolution! Long live the Red Guards! Mao Zedong Thought will surely triumph throughout the world."

The broad masses of Japanese spectators praised the achievements of China's socialist construction as a brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought. A young Japanese friend wrote in a letter to the Chinese exhibition team: Every exhibit in the exhibition is a new achievement of the 700 million people of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. He shouted in his letter: "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Many spectators expressed their love for Chairman Mao and their friendship with the Chinese people when they met with members of the Chinese exhibition team. A young man named Yokoji Kan, who came to the exhibition three times, asked the exhibition team members to introduce their experiences in studying the works of Chairman Mao. He said he would read Chairman Mao's books every day, like the Chinese people, to reform himself and become a firm revolutionary.

During the exhibition in Nagoya, the bookstore set up at the exhibition sold Japanese editions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and received enthusiastic welcome from the audience. A female worker from the first industrial pharmaceutical company in Kyoto said, "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is a priceless treasure. Every time I read "Resolutely decide to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," I feel full of strength.

The broad Japanese friends regarded the successful holding of the exhibition as a common cause of the people of China and Japan. After the news of right-wing hooligans, with the connivance of the Japanese police authorities, continuously disrupting and sabotaging the exhibition in Nagoya, more than 100 friendly companies sent 200 to 300 Japanese friends to bravely participate in the defense of the exhibition site. The president of the Kokko Trading Company put down his work in the company and guarded the portrait of Chairman Mao at the exhibition site. He said, "Standing under the portrait of Chairman Mao, my responsibility is very heavy. I will not allow any saboteurs to damage the portrait of the most beloved leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao."

Before the exhibition was held in Nagoya, a small group of followers of Soviet modern revisionism organized some fake "cooperation associations" and "support associations" under the pretext of "cooperation," intending to carry out sabotage activities. After the incident of right-wing hooligans disrupting the exhibition, they not only did not condemn the Japanese reactionaries and hooligans but also more fiercely attacked the Chinese exhibition and obstructed the sale of newspapers and periodicals promoting Mao Zedong Thought published by Japanese friends through their lackeys who had infiltrated the book sales committee. However, their sabotage activities only exposed their ugly faces more.

Just as Chairman Mao pointed out: "Friends have true and false, but through practice, one can see who is a true friend and who is a false friend." Through this struggle, the broad Japanese friends have come to realize that in order to achieve true Sino-Japanese friendship, they must oppose American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries and must oppose a small group of followers of Soviet modern revisionism.

### 毛泽东思想的伟大胜利　日中友好的伟大胜利  日本三百七十多万人参观了我国经济贸易展览会  广大观众表达了对毛主席的热爱并热烈赞颂中国文化大革命

    毛泽东思想的伟大胜利　日中友好的伟大胜利
    日本三百七十多万人参观了我国经济贸易展览会
    广大观众表达了对毛主席的热爱并热烈赞颂中国文化大革命
    据新华社十二日讯名古屋消息：闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的中国经济贸易展览会，十一日在名古屋市胜利闭幕。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是中日友好事业的伟大胜利。
    中国经济贸易展览会继在北九州展出二十一天后，从十一月十九日起又在名古屋市展出了二十二天。两个展览会的观众共达三百七十多万人。这个数字等于苏联现代修正主义集团不久前在大阪举行的工商业展览会观众人数的十多倍，同时也创造了世界各国在日本举行的国际展览会观众人数的最高纪录。
    还在展览会举行之前，一小撮苏联现代修正主义的追随者，就说什么如果没有他们的“组织动员”，观众最多只能有五万人。但是，事实对他们是那么无情，这伙可怜的“预言家”彻底破产了。
    正在中国无产阶级文化大革命高潮中举行的这次展览会，得到日本各阶层广大人民的热烈支持。日中友好协会（正统）兵库县总部的泽田雅利说，通过展览会，日本人民更加认识到毛主席亲自领导的文化大革命的伟大意义。来自东京的海老原璋光在留言簿上写道：“文化大革命胜利万岁！红卫兵胜利万岁！毛泽东思想必将在全世界胜利。”
    广大日本观众称赞中国社会主义建设的成就是伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。一位日本青年朋友在写给中国展览团的信中说：展览会的每一件展品，都是以毛泽东思想武装起来的中国七亿人民在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的三大革命运动中取得的新成果。他在信中高呼：“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    许多观众在同中国展览团员接触中，热情地表达对毛主席的热爱和对中国人民的友情。一位名叫横江诰的青年，三次来展览会请展览团员介绍学习毛主席著作的经验。他表示要像中国人一样，天天读毛主席的书，改造自己，成为一个坚定的革命者。
    在名古屋市展出时，展览会附设的书店里出售的日文版《毛主席语录》受到观众热烈的欢迎。京都第一工业制药公司的一位女工说，《毛主席语录》是无价之宝。我每次读到“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”时，就觉得浑身都是力量。
    广大日本朋友把开好展览会当成日中两国人民的共同事业。当右翼暴徒在日本警察当局纵容下，在名古屋连续对展览会进行破坏、捣乱的消息传出后，有一百多个友好公司的二、三百名日本朋友，奋勇前来参加保卫会场的工作。港光商事公司的社长放下公司里的工作，在展览会场内保卫毛主席像。他说：“站在毛主席像下面，我的责任非常重大，决不允许有任何破坏分子损坏中国人民最敬爱的领袖毛主席的画像。”
    展览会在名古屋举行之前，一小撮苏联现代修正主义的追随者组织了一些虚伪的“协力会”、“后援会”等，打着“合作”的幌子，蓄意进行破坏活动。在右翼暴徒破坏展览会的事件发生之后，他们不仅不谴责日本反动派和暴徒，反而更加疯狂地攻击中国展览会，并通过他们的混进书籍贩卖委员会的娄罗，阻挠出售日本朋友出版的宣传毛泽东思想的报刊。但是，他们这些破坏活动只会更加暴露他们自己的丑恶面目。
    正像毛主席指出的：“朋友有真假，但通过实践可以看清谁是真朋友，谁是假朋友。”广大日本朋友通过这一斗争，更加认清，为了真正的日中友好，就必须反对美帝国主义和日本反动派，必须反对一小撮苏联现代修正主义的追随者。
