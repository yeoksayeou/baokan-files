Edition: 3

Editor's Note: This report introduces a young hero who grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. Fifteen-year-old Wang Liqun sacrificed his life to rescue a drowning classmate. He put into practice his bold vow: "As long as the Party and the people need me, I am willing to sacrifice my life."

Wang Liqun was born in the new society and grew up under the red flag, enjoying a happy childhood. From Chairman Mao's works and revolutionary predecessors, he learned what to hate and what to love, what exploitation is, and what revolution is. He deeply understood that only under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao would we have today's happiness and a beautiful future. Therefore, he loved Chairman Mao immensely, posting Mao's portraits everywhere so that he could "see Chairman Mao and think of Chairman Mao" at all times. He seriously read Chairman Mao's books, learning a little and applying a little, striving to plant the roots of Mao Zedong Thought in his mind. His boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and his sincere affection for Chairman Mao's works filled his entire life and his entire being.

Wang Liqun was an outstanding representative of revolutionary youth in the Mao Zedong era. Millions of young people will take Wang Liqun as their example, loving Chairman Mao as he did, studying Chairman Mao's works as he did, and in the great waves of revolutionary struggle, especially in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, tempering themselves into a new generation of communists.

Mao Zedong's era is an era of heroes! Under the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought, in the gallery of heroes of our time, another young hero who sacrificed himself to save others has been added!

His name is Wang Liqun. He was only fifteen years old and was a graduate of Hongqi Primary School in Xining, Qinghai Province, this past summer. On September 17th of this year, Wang Liqun fearlessly jumped into the raging river and rescued a drowning classmate, but he himself sacrificed his young life.

When the People Need Us

The rain had just stopped over the Qinghai Plateau. Young Pioneer Wang Liqun and a friend were playing happily by the swollen Huangshui River. Suddenly, they heard shouts of "save someone" from downstream. He rushed over and saw a child struggling in the whirlpool. Without hesitation, Wang Liqun prepared to jump into the river to rescue him. At that moment, his friend, who was following behind, anxiously shouted, "It's dangerous to go down! Quickly call an adult to save him!" Call an adult? Such a thing couldn't wait! Just at this critical moment, Wang Liqun leaped into the river and reached out his right hand towards the child who was floating in the whirlpool. This strong and powerful hand pulled the child out of the whirlpool, saving him from danger. However, Wang Liqun himself was unfortunately swept away by the surging river and was carried away by the raging waters.

A worker pulled Wang Liqun from several hundred meters downstream. Medical personnel performed extensive rescue efforts. But it was too late.

In Wang Liqun's home, our young hero lay on the bed, as peaceful as if he were sleeping. People gathered around him. The neighbor's aunties and uncles remembered how this child often helped with chores, the vegetable market service staff remembered how he often quietly came to clean the counter, the laborers remembered how he always helped push the carts uphill, and the children remembered how this big brother often taught them revolutionary songs and recited Chairman Mao's quotations. Everyone's hearts were filled with respect, gratitude, and sorrow. Uncles and aunts repeatedly felt his pulse and listened to his heartbeat. They hoped so much that he could come back to life!

A Heart Turned Towards Chairman Mao

Wang Liqun was born in Fuxian County, Liaoning Province. His father was a cadre promoted from a worker. In 1956, Wang Liqun followed his father to the Qinghai Plateau. Due to illness, Wang Liqun started school at the age of nine. Soon, he joined the Young Pioneers and was elected as the team leader. Under the education of the Party and Youth League organizations, Wang Liqun learned what to hate and what to love. His mother, who came from a poor peasant family, often told him family stories. Whenever his mother talked about how their family was persecuted by the landlord, had no place to live, and often hid in the cornfields, resulting in the death of several family members from illness, Wang Liqun's heart was filled with hatred for the old society. Wang Liqun often compared his childhood with his mother, grandmother, and the old poor peasants and workers who had told him family and factory histories. The more he compared, the more he felt that today's children live in unprecedented happiness. He deeply understood that the billions of people in our motherland, from suffering to happiness, the limitless beautiful future of our motherland, and the bright future of the people of the world, are all closely connected with our great leader Chairman Mao. He loved Chairman Mao immensely. This sincere and noble revolutionary sentiment grew stronger and deeper as he grew older.

Wang Liqun posted many portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao on the walls of his home. He placed a color portrait of Chairman Mao by his bed and often gazed at it with deep affection. His mother asked, "Who is like you, posting Chairman Mao's portrait so low?" He replied, "This way, I can see Chairman Mao as soon as I open my eyes in the morning." One morning, he excitedly told his younger brother that he had dreamed of Tiananmen Square, where he saw Chairman Mao smiling and waving to him in the joyful crowd. He said passionately, "When will it not be in a dream, but truly in front of Tiananmen, shouting 'Long live Chairman Mao' in front of Chairman Mao!"

Wang Liqun was in charge of the team newspaper. The first thing he always did was to paste a portrait of Chairman Mao on the cover, so that his classmates would see Chairman Mao first when they read the team newspaper and think of Chairman Mao. He pasted three portraits of Chairman Mao by the radio, so that the whole family could see Chairman Mao and think of Chairman Mao while listening to the broadcast. Every time he changed a diary, he always pasted a portrait of Chairman Mao on the first page, so that he could see Chairman Mao and think of Chairman Mao while recording each day's activities.

This July, Wang Liqun's older brother returned from Shanghai and brought back some gifts for his younger siblings. Wang Liqun loved the statue of Chairman Mao the most. He tidied up his desk and respectfully placed the statue of Chairman Mao on it. On September 16th, he saw in the newspaper a photo of Chairman Mao receiving a hundred thousand revolutionary students and teachers at Tiananmen Square, and his heart was deeply moved. He specially bought a copy of the newspaper. However, he did not have time to cut out this beloved photo before he heroically sacrificed his life. His boundless love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao permeated his entire life and being.

Mao's Works Must Be Studied Every Day

In March 1963, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng." Twelve-year-old Wang Liqun actively responded. He realized that to truly learn Lei Feng's communist spirit, he must, like Lei Feng, study and apply Chairman Mao's works. He used his pocket money and the money he earned from collecting scraps to buy single-volume works by Chairman Mao such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "Serve the People," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and "Oppose Liberalism." At that time, he was still a third-grade student. When he read Chairman Mao's works and didn't recognize some characters, he would ask others. Seeing him study so seriously, his father gave him a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" (Type B). Wang Liqun was so happy that he sang and danced, and studied even harder. After the heroic deeds of the great communist warrior Wang Jie were published, Wang Liqun studied Chairman Mao's works even more diligently. He neatly copied Wang Jie's famous words, "Do as Chairman Mao says," on the first page of his diary.

During the holidays, Wang Liqun often studied Chairman Mao's works until late at night. His mother returned from a meeting outside, and he didn't even notice. Sometimes he got up late, and he would blame his mother for not waking him up earlier. His mother asked him, "It's the holidays, can't you sleep a little longer?" He said, "I have to study Chairman Mao's works in the morning! You can skip a meal, but you can't skip studying Chairman Mao's works for a day!"

Wang Liqun didn't have "Quotations from Chairman Mao" at the time, so he borrowed others' and copied over a hundred and fifty quotations. When he got "Quotations from Chairman Mao," he always carried it in his pocket, taking it out to read at any time.

This spring, their team helped a nearby production brigade plow the land. They were working hard when it suddenly started to rain. Some classmates wanted to finish early and go home, so they plowed the land shallowly. Wang Liqun said to his classmates, "Chairman Mao teaches us to be extremely responsible in our work. We have learned Chairman Mao's works, so we must faithfully execute them. If the land is plowed shallowly, the production brigade will reduce production." The classmates accepted his advice, and although the rain continued to fall, everyone worked even more carefully and meticulously.

There was a female classmate who was criticized for being pampered, and she couldn't understand it, pouting for days without talking to anyone. Wang Liqun took the initiative to talk to her, helping her study Chairman Mao's works and correctly face criticism. This female classmate was greatly inspired, recognized her shortcomings, and gradually corrected them in her actions.

Wang Liqun was in the fourth grade when he fell ill and was hospitalized. After recovering, he found arithmetic difficult. Once, a classmate saw him struggling with a difficult problem for a long time and pushed the answer in front of him. He pushed it away and said, "Only what I think out for myself can be remembered for a lifetime." Chairman Mao's teaching, "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," gave him strength and increased his confidence in overcoming difficulties. For a period, he studied arithmetic for an hour every night after studying Chairman Mao's works. Later, his arithmetic caught up, and he achieved excellent results.

Wang Liqun not only studied and applied Chairman Mao's works himself but was also an enthusiastic propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought. Last winter vacation and this summer vacation, he organized nearby children to study Chairman Mao's works every morning. If someone came late, he would go door to door to call them; if someone was lazy, he would patiently guide them. Passersby often saw him standing among a group of children, facing the rising sun, loudly reciting Chairman Mao's works and leading the singing of "The East Is Red." Near his residence, the neighborhood committee made two Mao Zedong quotations boards, and Wang Liqun often helped write them. He was small, so he had to stand on a high stool to write. Once he fell off and bruised his knees. His mother told him to find a taller person to write, but he said, "Promoting Mao Zedong Thought, what's a couple of falls?"

His mother and grandmother didn't know many characters. Wang Liqun got a small blackboard and wrote a quotation from Chairman Mao: "To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai; to work for the reactionaries is lighter than a feather." He led his mother and grandmother to read it over and over, telling them the story of Zhang Zedong, who did many good deeds for the people and died for the people's interests.

A Heart for the Chinese Revolution and the World Revolution

Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the young Wang Liqun was very concerned about national and international affairs. For Wang Liqun, listening to the radio was an indispensable part of his daily life. No matter how busy the homework was, or how excited the play was, he would never miss this "required course." He did this himself and also required his mother and grandmother to do the same. Sometimes, he saw his mother busy washing dishes and pulled her to the radio, taking over her work himself. His mother said, "I can listen while doing the dishes!" He said, "But you won't listen well. I have already formed the habit of listening to the radio while doing chores."

When he heard on the radio that our great motherland had successfully conducted a nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials, he was so excited that he couldn't sleep all night. The next day, he went to school especially early and wrote three large red posters, pasting them on the streets and at the school gate, quickly spreading this heartening news to more people, letting everyone cheer for our country's great scientific and national defense achievements, and cheer for this great contribution to the defense of world peace!

The evil American imperialists were crazily expanding their aggression in Vietnam, bombing Hanoi and Haiphong, and Wang Liqun was indignant, clenching his fists and saying to his mother, "We must support the Vietnamese people! I hope to grow up quickly to fight side by side with the Vietnamese uncles!" He read "Live Like Him" over and over, a book full of revolutionary enthusiasm. The heroic image of Nguyen Van Truong inspired him. He and his entire class wrote a letter full of proletarian internationalism to the wife of the martyr, attaching a red scarf. Let them, carrying deep revolutionary feelings, cross thousands of mountains and rivers, and send them to the heroic land of Vietnam.

In Wang Liqun's small heart, there was the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. He wrote in his diary, "Listen to Chairman Mao, vow to be a revolutionary." He was always ready to take over the revolution, better serve the people of the country and the world. He studied hard and insisted on physical exercise. He said, "We study now, just to better revolutionize in the future."

Wang Liqun collected many books and albums introducing revolutionary heroes. The tall figures of heroes inspired him. With a heart full of longing and respect, he often told his young friends about the heroic deeds of Liu Huilan, Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Ou Yanghai, and Liu Wenjun. With a heart full of excitement, he actively participated in the activities of promoting the heroic deeds of Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Jiao Yulu, and Liu Yingjun. Wang Liqun loved them, learned from them, and was determined to be like them, loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people.

Wang Liqun hated class enemies deeply. Once, when the school showed the movie "White-Haired Girl," Wang Liqun saw the scenes of the landlord bully brutally oppressing the working people and gnashed his teeth in hatred. He waved his fists and said, "Such a bad guy must be smashed to death!" One evening, at a residents' meeting, Wang Liqun and his younger brother's task was to monitor the four-class elements under control. At that time, it was windy and raining, and his younger brother stood guard for a while and wanted to go back. Wang Liqun said to his younger brother, "The darker and colder the night, the more the class enemies will try to sneak in. Don't you remember Chairman Mao's words? 'After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist.'" Hearing this, his younger brother became spirited, and both of them stood guard vigilantly. When he heard about Deng Tuo's anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes, he immediately picked up his pen to join the fight, writing several denunciation articles in just a few days and sending them to newspapers. In the school's Cultural Revolution movement, he was the first to write a sharp big-character poster to a teacher with anti-Party and anti-socialist behavior.

Wang Liqun loved state property and cared about collective interests. When the desks in the classroom were broken, he brought nails and a hammer from home to fix them. When the blackboard eraser was broken, he made a new one from his father's old boots and quietly placed it on the podium. Last autumn, a big wind blew down many nearly ripe fruits in the schoolyard. Some classmates went to pick and eat them, but Wang Liqun collected the fruits and sent them to the office. He said, "This belongs to the state, we can't eat it casually."

Following the examples of Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Liu Yingjun, Wang Liqun did good deeds wherever he went. Once, Wang Liqun saw an old woman struggling with a child in her left arm and a bundle in her right hand, and he rushed forward to take the bundle and put it on his own shoulder. Some classmates saw him walking and talking affectionately with the old woman and thought the old woman was his grandmother!

In school, Wang Liqun cared the most about his classmates. He had made many small notebooks during his spare time and given them to some classmates to copy Chairman Mao's quotations. On winter mornings, Wang Liqun always arrived at school early to start the stove. His mother saw him leaving so early and asked if he was cold. He said, "I'm a little cold, but everyone will be warm as soon as they enter the classroom."

In the residential compound where he lived, Wang Liqun was a child loved by everyone. If a family had no labor force and had difficulty carrying water, he would help carry water. If a family was making coal bricks, he would also run over, roll up his pants, and help for a while. Two days before his sacrifice, Wang Liqun saw it raining again and went door to door to collect rain gear, bravely sending it to the aunts who were participating in voluntary labor in the rain. On the day of his sacrifice, he also helped a five-guarantee household in his compound pull the bellows for a long time!

Under Chairman Mao's guidance, Wang Liqun was determined to fight for the cause of the proletarian revolution for life, and he was willing to sacrifice his life as long as the Party and the people needed him. On December 15th of last year, he read in a magazine about Comrade Xu Ruyi, who sacrificed himself to save five children, and was deeply moved. He wrote in his diary, "In the future, I will definitely learn from Comrade Xu Ruyi and put the results of my learning into my specific actions." His older brother saw this diary entry and casually asked, "Can you do what you wrote?" Wang Liqun firmly replied, "When the people need me, I will definitely be able to do it!"

Wang Liqun grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and was one of the millions of revolutionary youths in our country. People are saddened by the loss of such a heroic youth, but they are also proud of the heroic era of Mao Zedong. Everyone unanimously praised Wang Liqun as a good child educated by Chairman Mao. With such descendants, our great socialist motherland will remain red and strong for thousands of generations, forever an iron-clad red land!

One Wang Liqun has sacrificed himself, but ten thousand Wang Liquns are growing. Red Guards and revolutionary youths continuously come to Wang Liqun's grave, holding "Quotations from Chairman Mao," reading over and over again Chairman Mao's words: "People all die, but death has different meanings. ... To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai; to work for the reactionaries is lighter than a feather." People are not only remembering him but also inspiring themselves: to learn and apply Chairman Mao's works like Wang Liqun, to temper themselves in the great waves of class struggle, and to become strong successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The call to learn from Wang Liqun spread throughout the schools, factories, communes, and units of the Qinghai Plateau. Wang Liqun's heroic deeds are spreading across thousands of mountains and rivers to every corner of the motherland. The young hero Wang Liqun has not died! He will forever live in the hearts of billions of revolutionary people!

The rescued child Li Jingping (front) changed his name to Li Xueqing to express his determination to learn Wang Liqun's sublime communist spirit. Li Xueqing sent a portrait of Chairman Mao to Wang Liqun's parents and expressed to them that he would be like Wang Liqun, forever reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and being a good student of Chairman Mao.

    毛泽东时代的少年英雄
    ——记王利庆舍己救人的光辉事迹
    编者按：这篇通讯，介绍了一个在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的红色少年的光辉事迹。十五岁的小朋友王利庆，为了抢救一个溺水的同学，献出了自己的生命。他用自己的英雄行为实践了自己的豪迈誓言：只要党和人民需要，就是牺牲生命也在所不惜。
    王利庆生在新社会，长在红旗下，过着幸福的童年生活。他从毛主席著作中，从革命的前辈那里，懂得了应该恨什么，应该爱什么，懂得了什么是剥削，什么是革命。他深刻地认识到，只有在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，我们才会有幸福的今天，美好的未来。因此，他无限热爱毛主席，把毛主席像贴在各处，为的是时时刻刻能够“看到毛主席，想着毛主席”。他认真读毛主席的书，学一点，用一点，努力照毛主席的指示办事，努力在自己的头脑里扎下毛泽东思想的根子。对毛主席的无限忠心，对毛主席著作的真挚感情，充满在他生活的全部，生命的始终。
    王利庆是毛泽东时代革命青少年的一个优秀代表。千千万万青少年将以王利庆为榜样，像他那样无限热爱毛主席，像他那样认真学习毛主席著作，在革命斗争的大风大浪里，特别是在当前的无产阶级文化大革命中，把自己锻炼成为共产主义的一代新人。
      毛泽东时代英雄辈出！在伟大毛泽东思想的阳光雨露哺育下，在我们时代的英雄群像中，又增添了一个舍己救人的少年英雄！
    他名叫王利庆，只有十五岁，是青海省西宁市红旗小学今年暑期的毕业生。今年九月十七日下午，王利庆奋不顾身地跳进滚滚激流，把一个溺水的小同学抢救出来，而自己却献出了年轻的生命。
      当人民需要的时候
    青海高原久雨初晴。少先队员王利庆和一个小伙伴，在涨了水的湟水河畔正玩得高兴，忽然听到下游高喊“救人”。他飞跑过去，只见一个小孩正在漩涡中挣扎。王利庆毫不犹豫地准备下河搭救。这时，跟在他后边的小伙伴焦急地高喊：“下去危险呀，快叫大人来救！”叫大人来？这样的事情怎能等待！就在这千钧一发的时刻，王利庆奋身跃入河中，向浮沉在漩涡中的小孩伸出了他的右手。这只坚强有力的手，一下子就把那个小孩扯出漩涡，使他脱离险境。而王利庆自己却不幸卷入激流，被汹涌澎湃的河水冲下去了。
    一位工人把王利庆从数百米的下游抢捞上来。医务人员进行了多方面的抢救。但是，已经来不及了。
    在王利庆的家里，我们的少年英雄躺在床上，就像平常安睡时一样恬静。人们围在他的周围。邻居的大娘和阿姨们想起这孩子常常帮忙干活，蔬菜商场的服务员想起他常常不声不响地来打扫柜台，搬运工人想起他总是在上坡时帮着推车，孩子们想起这个小哥哥常常教他们唱革命歌曲，念毛主席语录。大家心里又崇敬，又感动，又悲痛。叔叔阿姨们一再摸他的脉位，听他的心口窝。他们多么希望他能再活转来呀！
        红心向着毛主席
    王利庆出生在辽宁复县。他父亲是由工人提拔起来的干部。一九五六年，王利庆随着父亲来到青海高原。由于多病，王利庆九岁才上学。不久就加入了少先队，并被选为小队长。在党团组织的教育下，王利庆懂得了应该恨什么，应该爱什么。他的贫农出身的母亲，常常给他讲家史。每当母亲讲到一家人被地主迫害，没有房子住，常常在高粱地里藏身，因而接连病死几个亲人的悲惨情景时，王利庆心里就充满了对旧社会的仇恨。王利庆常常同妈妈、姥姥以及给他讲过家史、厂史的老贫农、老工人比童年，越比越觉得今天少年儿童生活得无比幸福。他深深懂得，祖国亿万人民从苦难走向幸福，祖国无限美好的未来，世界人民光明的前途，都和我们伟大的领袖毛主席紧紧相连。他无限热爱毛主席。这种真挚高尚的革命感情，随着他年龄的增长而越来越强烈，越来越深厚。
    王利庆在他家的墙壁上，贴了许多张伟大领袖毛主席的像片。他把一张毛主席彩色像片贴在床头上，常常怀着深情凝视着。妈妈问：“谁像你，把毛主席像贴得这么低？”他回答说：“这样，我清早一睁开眼就能看见毛主席。”一天早上，他兴奋地告诉弟弟，他做梦到了天安门广场，在欢乐的人流中，看到毛主席微笑着向他招手。他满怀激情地说：“什么时候不在梦中，而是真正在天安门前，当着毛主席的面高呼毛主席万岁啊！”
    王利庆负责办队报。他念念不忘的第一件事，就是在报头贴上毛主席像，让同学们在看队报时第一眼就看到毛主席，想着毛主席。他在收音机旁边贴了三张毛主席像，为的是让全家在收听广播时，看到毛主席，想着毛主席。每换一个日记本，他总是在头一页贴上毛主席像，为的是在记下每一天的活动时，看到毛主席，想着毛主席。
    今年七月，王利庆的哥哥从上海回来，给弟妹带回一些礼物。王利庆最爱的就是毛主席塑像。他把桌子收拾得干干净净，恭恭敬敬地摆上毛主席塑像。九月十六日，他看到当天报上登着毛主席在天安门前接见百万革命师生的照片，心里非常激动。他特地买了一份报。但是，他还没有来得及把这张心爱的照片剪贴下来，就英勇牺牲了。他对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的感情，贯彻在生活的全部，生命的始终。
    毛主席著作一天不学都不行
    一九六三年三月，毛主席发出“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召。十二岁的王利庆积极响应。他认识到，要把雷锋叔叔的共产主义精神真正学到手，就必须像雷锋叔叔那样活学活用毛主席著作。他把妈妈给的零花钱和自己拣废品换来的钱，买了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《反对自由主义》等毛主席著作单行本。当时他还是三年级的小学生。读毛主席著作，有些字认不得，就去问人。爸爸见他学得这样认真，便送给他一本《毛泽东著作选读》乙种本。王利庆高兴得唱呀跳呀，学习更加努力了。伟大的共产主义战士王杰的英雄事迹发表后，王利庆学习毛主席著作更用心了。他把王杰同志的名言“毛主席怎样说的，我就怎样做”，端端正正抄在日记本的第一页上。
    在假期里，王利庆也常常学习毛主席著作到深夜。妈妈从外边开会回来，他也觉察不到。有时起床晚了，他就埋怨妈妈为啥不早点叫他。妈妈问他：“放假了，多睡会儿也不行？”他说：“我早晨要学习毛主席著作呀！饭一天不吃能行，毛主席著作一天不学可不行！”
    王利庆还没有《毛主席语录》时，就借别人的抄，先后抄了一百五十多条。有了《毛主席语录》，他就时刻揣在衣兜里，随时拿出来读。
    今年春天，他们小队帮助附近的生产队翻地。正干得起劲，天忽然下起雨来。有的同学想早翻完早回家，地翻得浅了。王利庆对同学们说：“毛主席教导我们，对工作要极端的负责任。我们学了毛主席著作，就要忠实执行。地翻浅了，生产队要减产的。”同学们接受了他的意见，虽然雨仍然下个不停，可大家干得更加认真细致了。
    有个女同学，有人批评她娇气，她想不通，几天噘着嘴不理人。王利庆就主动同她交谈，帮助她学习毛主席著作，正确对待批评。这个女同学受到很大启发，认识了自己的缺点，以后在行动中逐渐改正了。
    王利庆在四年级的时候，因病住了医院。病好以后，学习算术很吃力。有一次，一个同学看到他一道难题很久作不出来，就把作好的答案送到他面前。他却推开说：“只有靠自己想出来的，才能记一辈子。”毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，使他增添了力量，提高了克服困难的信心。有一段时间，他每天晚上学习毛主席著作之后，都补习一个小时算术。后来，他的算术终于赶上去了，并且取得了优良成绩。
    王利庆不仅自己学，自己用，还是一个热情传播毛泽东思想的小宣传员。去年寒假和今年暑假，他每天早晨都组织附近的小朋友学习毛主席著作。谁来迟了，他就挨户去叫；那个贪玩，他就耐心地诱导。过路的人们，常常看到他站在一群孩子中间，迎着初升的太阳，高声朗读毛主席著作，领唱《大海航行靠舵手》。在他住所附近，街道办事处做了两块毛主席语录牌，王利庆经常帮助抄写。他个子小，只好大凳搁小凳，站在上面抄。有一次不小心摔了下来，把膝盖都碰破了。妈妈让他找个高个子来写，他却说：“宣传毛泽东思想，摔两下怕什么！”
    妈妈和姥姥都识字不多。王利庆弄了一块小黑板，写上毛主席语录：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”他一遍一遍地领着妈妈和姥姥读，给她们讲张思德为人民做了很多好事，为人民利益而死的故事。
    心里装着中国革命和世界革命
    在毛泽东思想哺育下，小小的王利庆十分关心国家大事，关心世界大事。对王利庆说来，收听广播是每天生活中不可缺少的一件事。不管功课再忙，也不管玩的再起劲，都不会丢掉这门“必修课”。他自己这样做，也要求妈妈和姥姥这样做。有时，他看到妈妈忙着刷锅洗碗，就把妈妈拉到收音机跟前，自己代替她劳动。妈妈说：“我做着活也能听呀！”他却说：“那你听不好，我已经养成了边做活边听广播的习惯。”
    当他从广播里听到我们伟大祖国成功地进行了含有热核材料的核爆炸的消息后，激动得一夜没有睡好。第二天，他到校特别早，一连写了三张大红喜报，贴到大街上和校门口，把这个振奋人心的喜讯尽早告诉更多的人，让大家为祖国这一伟大的科学和国防成就而欢呼，为这一保卫世界和平的伟大贡献而欢呼！
    万恶的美帝国主义疯狂地在越南扩大侵略战争，对河内和海防进行狂轰滥炸，王利庆义愤填膺，紧握着拳头对妈妈说：“我们一定要支援越南人民！我希望快快长大，好同越南叔叔一起并肩战斗。”他一遍又一遍地读《像他那样生活》这本充满了革命豪情的书。阮文追烈士的英雄形象激励着他。他和全班同学一起，给烈士的妻子，写了一封充满无产阶级国际主义精神的慰问信，附上一条红领巾。让它们带着深厚的革命感情，穿过万水千山，送到英雄的越南国土。
    在王利庆小小的心灵里，装着中国革命和世界革命。他在自己的日记本上写着：“听毛主席的话，誓作革命人。”他时刻准备着接好革命的班，更好地为全国和全世界人民服务。他刻苦学习，坚持锻炼身体。他说：“我们现在学习，就是为了将来更好地革命。”
        踏着英雄的脚印前进
    王利庆搜集了许多介绍革命英雄的书籍和画册。英雄的高大形象，时刻鼓舞着他。他怀着向往和崇敬的心情，多次给小朋友们讲述刘胡兰、董存瑞、黄继光、欧阳海、刘文学等人的英雄事迹。他怀着激动的心情，积极参加宣传雷锋、王杰、焦裕禄、刘英俊英雄事迹的活动。王利庆热爱他们，学习他们，决心像他们那样忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民。
    王利庆对阶级敌人无比仇恨。有一次，学校里放映电影《白毛女》，王利庆看到恶霸地主凶残地欺压劳动人民的镜头时，恨得直咬牙。他挥舞着拳头说：
  “这样的坏蛋非砸死不可！”有一天晚上开居民大会，王利庆和他弟弟的任务是监视被管制的四类分子。当时又刮风，又下雨，弟弟站了一会岗，就想回去。王利庆对弟弟说：“越是天黑风冷，阶级敌人越可能钻空子。你不记得毛主席的话吗？‘在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在’。”听了这番话，弟弟精神抖擞起来，两个人都十分警惕地坚守岗位。当他听到邓拓黑帮反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行时，立刻拿起笔来参加战斗，短短几天就写了几篇声讨文章，投寄给报刊。在学校的文化大革命运动中，他第一个给有反党反社会主义言行的教师写出了尖锐的大字报。
    王利庆热爱国家财产，关心集体利益。教室里的桌子坏了，他就从家里拿了钉子和锤子来修理。黑板刷坏了，他就把爸爸的破毡靴拆掉做成刷子，不声不响地放到讲台上。去年秋天，一场大风把校园里快要成熟的果子刮落了不少，有的同学去拣着吃，王利庆却把果子收集起来，送到办公室去。他说：“这是属于国家的，我们不能随便吃。”
    向雷锋、王杰、刘英俊学习，王利庆走到哪里，就把好事做到哪里。有一次，王利庆看到一个老大娘左手抱孩子，右手提包袱，吃力地走着，他就抢上前去接过包袱背在自己肩上。有的同学看到他同老人亲昵地边走边说话，还以为这位老大娘是他的姥姥哩！
    在学校里，王利庆最关心同学。他曾经利用课余时间做了许多小本子，送给一些同学抄毛主席语录。冬天的早晨，王利庆总是提前到校，把教室的火炉生起来。妈妈见他走得这样早，问他冷不冷。他说：“我一个人冷一点，可是大家一走进教室就会暖烘烘的。”
    在他住的家属大院里，王利庆是一个人人喜欢的孩子。谁家没有劳力，打水有困难，他就帮忙打水。谁家在做煤砖，他也会主动跑来，卷起裤腿插手干一阵。他牺牲的前两天中午，王利庆看到又下起雨来，就挨门逐户地搜集雨具，冒雨给正在参加义务劳动的阿姨们送去。就在牺牲的那天上午，他还帮助同院的一户五保户老太太拉了好久风箱哩！
    王利庆在毛主席的教导下，决心像革命英雄那样，为无产阶级的革命事业奋斗终生，只要党和人民需要，就是牺牲生命也在所不惜。去年十二月十五日，他在一本杂志上读了许如意同志为了抢救五名儿童而牺牲的英雄事迹，深深地受了感动。他在日记上这样写道：“我今后一定要向许如意叔叔学习，把学习的结果落实到自己的具体行动中。”他哥哥看了这段日记顺口问道：“你写的能做得到吗？”王利庆坚定地回答说：“当人民需要的时候，我一定能够做到！”
      永远活在革命人民心中
    王利庆是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的红色少年，是我国亿万革命青少年中的一个。人们为失去了这样一位英雄少年而悲痛，也为英雄辈出的毛泽东时代而自豪。大家同声赞扬王利庆不愧是毛主席教育出来的好孩子。有了这样的后代，我们伟大的社会主义祖国，就能千秋万代不变色，永远是红通通的铁打江山！
    一个王利庆牺牲了，千万个王利庆在成长。红卫兵和革命青少年络绎不绝地来到王利庆墓前，手捧《毛主席语录》，一遍又一遍地朗读毛主席的这一段话：
  “人总是要死的，但死的意义有不同。……为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”人们是在追念他，也是在激励自己：要像王利庆那样活学活用毛主席著作，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里经受锻炼，做坚强的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    向王利庆学习的口号，传遍了青海高原的学校、工厂、公社和连队。王利庆的英雄事迹，正穿过千山万水，飞向祖国各地。少年英雄王利庆没有死！他将永远活在亿万革命人民的心中！　新华社记者（附图片）
