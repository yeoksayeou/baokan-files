For more than a decade, the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Tian Han has been secretly occupying a leading position in the theater world, engaging in anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought criminal activities. He colluded with Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and others, using various tactics to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian literary and artistic line. He enthusiastically promoted feudalism and capitalism, vigorously advocated for "fame," "foreign," and "ancient" elements, and used every means to oppose revolutionary modern theater and sabotage the reform of Peking Opera. He implemented a thorough revisionist line in the theater world.

A fervent promoter of feudal and capitalist arts

The superstructure must adapt to the economic base and actively serve it. If our literature and art do not adapt to the socialist economic base, they will inevitably undermine it.

Chairman Mao pointed out as early as 1944: "History is created by the people, but on the old stage (in all old literature and art that is detached from the people), the people are reduced to dregs, ruled by lords, ladies, young masters, and young ladies. This inversion of history is now being inverted by you, restoring history's true face..." However, for many years, Chairman Mao's great directive has not been genuinely implemented. This is the result of the frenzied resistance and defiance by the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and Tian Han.

To maintain this inverted historical situation, Tian Han has long resisted Chairman Mao's directive, issued more than twenty years ago, that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as the policy of pushing the old to make way for the new. He maliciously attacked the directive that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, calling it an "obstacle" to artistic development; he cursed serving proletarian politics as "sectarianism" and a "non-democratic tendency of one family beating the drum," urging people to "actively resist the 'left'" and eliminate these "obstacles." He indiscriminately praised traditional opera, labeling our approach as "overthrowing more than advancing," and even shouted the reactionary slogan: "Do not forget your ancestors." He threatened in a stern voice: "Some operas we have no right to change." Tian Han attempted to intimidate us and tie our hands, allowing ghosts and monsters to run wild and poisonous weeds to spread freely. In reality, we are not just changing them a little; we are a proletarian dictatorship state, and we are irreconcilable with those private ownership systems that oppress and exploit people. The task of our proletarian literature and art is to sweep away all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes; to strive to create new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of socialism. Without destruction, there can be no construction. Only by undergoing this revolution, cleansing the filth of feudalism and capitalism, can we create truly people-oriented, nationally styled socialist theater that the masses love to see and hear.

Old literature and art cannot adapt to the socialist economic base and must be revolutionized; ancient artistic forms cannot fully adapt to socialist ideological content and must be reformed. This is the demand of history, the right of history. However, Tian Han clings to feudalism and capitalism, using every effort to preserve old things and attempt to save them from death. We oppose the appearance of gods and ghosts on the socialist stage, but Tian Han says: "Whether gods or ghosts, they are all allowed in theater." We oppose feudal superstitions and feudal morality of loyalty, filial piety, and chastity, but Tian Han says: "We cannot say that loyalty, filial piety, and chastity are all feudal morality, and that writing about gods and ghosts is all propaganda of feudal superstition." We oppose emperors and generals, but Tian Han says: "From emperors and generals to clean officials, we should not deny them all..." In short, Tian Han always takes the opposite stance. Under the guise of "critically inheriting," he engages in unrevealed counter-revolutionary activities. We believe that much of the content of traditional opera is difficult to inherit, such as ghosts and gods. How can we critically inherit and push the old to make way for the new? We are atheists; we are Communists and do not believe in the existence of ghosts and gods in the world. Again, the feudal morality of the landlord class and the bourgeois morality, their so-called moral code, is to oppress and exploit people. Can we critically inherit them? Tian Han wants us to inherit all these old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits intact, with the purpose of preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism and making us forever slaves of the old world.

The chief culprit in suppressing revolutionary modern theater

While vigorously promoting traditional opera, Tian Han vigorously denigrates revolutionary modern theater; while enthusiastically advocating traditional and historical dramas, he desperately suppresses revolutionary modern theater. He opposes writers from depicting major themes of socialist revolution and socialist construction, saying these works have "major themes but low or even inferior ideological content"; he opposes praising the Party and the Three Red Banners, saying these works are "failures"; he opposes praising the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers, saying these works are "immature and deformed products." He falsely claims that our efforts in revolutionary modern theater have already deviated from the masses, facing a crisis, and causing chaos, even shouting: our insistence on the direction of modern theater is a "mistake." In December 1963, Chairman Mao criticized: "Many departments are still ruled by 'dead people'." "Many Communists enthusiastically promote feudal and capitalist arts but are not enthusiastic about promoting socialist arts, which is indeed strange." Yet, on December 20 of the same year, Tian Han, at a meeting of the Drama Association, openly defied this criticism, shouting fiercely: "Emperors and generals, talented scholars and beautiful women, dead people, and foreigners are also needed." As late as 1963, he still wrote a poem to attack the Party: "Laughable are those who clearly have two legs, but walk unevenly."

In 1964, when revolutionary modern theater was thriving, the sabotage activities of the Zhou Yang, Tian Han gang reached a frenzied level. At that time, Shanghai was holding an unprecedented large-scale drama festival in the East China region. Under the instructions of Zhou Yang and Lin Mo Han, Tian Han went to Shanghai to gather Qu Baiyin, Zhou Xinfan, and others to hold a meeting, playing counter-revolutionary tricks with the East China Drama Festival. They spoke in code, wrote black poems, shamelessly praised the so-called literature of the 1930s, and maliciously slandered the excellent works in the East China Drama Festival, attempting to drive the revolutionary modern theater, with Mao Zedong Thought as its soul, off the stage!

For a long time, Tian Han and his gang have used their authority to create various reasons to oppose the revolution of Peking Opera and sabotage the reform of theater. Every time we proceed in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, they jump out to block our way, obstructing and suppressing us in every possible way. Therefore, every step forward in the theater revolution is a serious class struggle. For example, the model operas of revolutionary Peking Opera such as "Shajiabang," "Red Lantern," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "Harbor," and "The Daring Mission" are all works that, under the personal leadership and guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing and others, have gone through arduous struggles with the Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, Tian Han gang, breaking through countless difficulties and obstacles.

The overthrown class enemies will not willingly die. Tian Han and his ilk, from their counter-revolutionary political sensitivity, sensed that the ghosts and monsters they had been protecting would be swept away by the revolutionary people like garbage from the socialist theater stage, and that revolutionary modern theater could not be slandered or stopped. Therefore, they used every trick, using "equal status" and "two legs walking" as a cover, aiming to achieve their ultimate goal of eliminating revolutionary modern theater and reversing the direction of socialist theater.

Chairman Mao said: "Anything reactionary, if you do not strike it, it will not fall. This is also like sweeping the floor. If the broom does not reach, the dust will not run away by itself." In 1964, under the guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, the modern Peking Opera observation and performance conference was held, raising high the banner of Peking Opera revolution, which sounded the death knell for Tian Han and his ilk. The further rise of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution made Tian Han and his ilk even more panic-stricken, and they adopted various conspiratorial means to make a last-ditch struggle. However, under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary people finally exposed the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Tian Han and his gang. Only by kicking out these stumbling blocks in our path can our socialist theater triumphantly advance along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao!

    踢开戏剧革命的绊脚石
    高红扬
    十几年来，反革命修正主义分子田汉一直窃踞着戏剧界的领导职位，干着反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶勾当。他与周扬、林默涵等相互勾结，阴一套，阳一套，采取了各种手法，同毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线相对抗。他热心提倡封建主义和资本主义的东西，竭力推崇“名”、“洋”、“古”，千方百计反对革命现代戏，百般阻挠和破坏京剧改革，在戏剧界推行了一条彻头彻尾的修正主义路线。
        封建主义和资本主义艺
    术的狂热鼓吹者
    上层建筑必须适应经济基础，必须积极为经济基础服务。我们的文学艺术不能适应社会主义的经济基础，那它就必然要破坏社会主义的经济基础。
    毛主席早在一九四四年就指示我们：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台，这种历史的颠倒，现在由你们再颠倒过来，恢复了历史的面目，……”但是，多少年来，毛主席的这一伟大指示并没有得到真正的贯彻，这是由于周扬、林默涵、田汉等反革命修正主义分子疯狂地抵制和抗拒的结果。
    为了保持这种历史颠倒的局面，田汉一直抗拒毛主席早在二十多年前就提出的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，以及推陈出新的方针。他恶毒地攻击文艺为工农兵服务的方向，是艺术发展的“障碍”；咒骂为无产阶级政治服务，是“宗派主义”，是“一家鸣锣的非民主倾向”，竭力鼓动人们起来“积极去反‘左’”，去扫除这些“障碍”。他对于传统戏曲不分精华糟粕，全盘肯定，诬蔑我们对传统“推翻有余，推进不足”，甚至发出“不要忘记了祖宗”的反动叫嚣，声色俱厉地威胁说：“有些戏我们根本没有资格去改。”田汉妄想借此吓住我们，束缚我们的手脚，好让牛鬼蛇神大肆出笼，各种毒草任意泛滥。其实，对于一切剥削阶级的反动文化，我们何止是“改一下子”呢！我们是无产阶级专政的国家，我们跟那些压迫人、剥削人的私有制度是势不两立的。我们无产阶级文艺的任务，就是要扫荡一切剥削阶级的旧思想，旧文化，旧风俗，旧习惯；努力创造社会主义的新思想，新文化，新风俗，新习惯。不破不立，经过这种革命，荡涤了封建主义、资本主义的污泥浊水，才能创造真正有人民大众的内容，人民喜闻乐见的民族形式的社会主义戏剧来。
    旧的文学艺术不能适应社会主义的经济基础，就必须革命；古典的艺术形式不能完全适应社会主义的思想内容，就必须改革。这是历史的要求，历史的权利。可是田汉死抱住封建主义、资本主义的东西不放，以种种努力去保持旧事物，企图使它得免于死亡。我们反对在社会主义的舞台上出现神仙鬼怪，田汉却说：“神也好，鬼也好，戏剧上都是允许的。”我们反对封建迷信和封建道德的忠孝节义，田汉却说：“不能说忠孝节义全是封建道德，写神仙鬼怪的全是宣传封建迷信”。我们反对帝王将相，田汉却说：“从帝王将相到清官都不应该一概否定。”……总之，田汉处处唱反调。他打着“批判地继承”的幌子，进行着不可告人的反革命勾当。我们认为传统戏曲的内容有许多是很难继承的，例如鬼神、宗教，我们怎么能批判地继承和推陈出新呢？我们是无神论者，我们是共产党员，根本不相信世界上有什么鬼神上帝。又如地主阶级的封建道德，资产阶级道德，它们的天经地义的道德，是要压迫人、剥削人的，难道我们能批判地继承它们吗？田汉要我们把这一切旧思想，旧文化，旧风俗，旧习惯原封不动地继承下来，其目的就是为复辟资本主义作舆论准备，让我们永远成为旧世界的奴隶。
    压制革命现代戏的罪魁祸首
    田汉在大肆吹捧传统戏曲的同时，竭力贬低革命现代戏；在狂热提倡传统剧、历史剧的同时，拚命压制革命现代戏。他反对作家去描写社会主义革命和社会主义建设的重大题材，说这些剧作“题材重大而思想内容不高，甚至是低劣的”；他反对歌颂党、歌颂三面红旗，说这些剧作是“失败”的；他反对歌颂工农兵英雄人物，说这些剧作是“不成熟的、畸形的产物”。他胡说我们搞革命现代戏已经脱离群众，面临危机，造成混乱局面，甚至叫嚷：我们坚持现代戏的方向是个“错误”。一九六三年十二月，毛主席批评：“许多部门至今还是‘死人’统治着。”“许多共产党人热心提倡封建主义和资本主义的艺术，却不热心提倡社会主义的艺术，岂非咄咄怪事。”而田汉竟在同年十二月二十日，在剧协的一次会议上，公开抗拒这一批评，恶狠狠地叫喊：“帝王将相、才子佳人、死人、外国人也要。”直到一九六三年，他还贼心不死地作诗来攻击党：“堪笑明明两条腿，走来常是不均匀。”
    一九六四年，当革命现代戏蓬勃发展的时候，周扬、田汉一伙的破坏活动也达到了疯狂的程度。当时，上海正举行规模空前的华东区话剧会演。田汉在周扬、林默涵等人的授意下，去上海纠集瞿白音、周信芳等一伙开会，与华东话剧会演唱对台戏。他们一起说黑话，写黑诗，无耻地吹捧所谓三十年代的文艺，恶毒诬蔑华东话剧会演中的优秀剧目，妄图把以毛泽东思想为灵魂的革命现代戏赶出舞台！
    长期以来，田汉等人利用职权，制造了种种理由，反对京剧革命，破坏戏剧改革。每当我们按照毛主席指引的方向进行革命，他们就跳出来挡住我们的去路，百般阻挠，横加压制。因此，我们在戏剧革命的道路上每前进一步，都要经过一场严重的阶级斗争。例如闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的《沙家浜》、《红灯记》、《智取威虎山》、《海港》、《奇袭白虎团》等革命京剧的样板戏，便是在江青同志等亲自主持和指导下，同周扬、林默涵、田汉等一伙进行艰苦的斗争，冲破了重重困难和阻挠才搞起来的。
    被推翻了的阶级敌人是不会甘心死亡的，田汉之流从他们那种反革命的政治敏感出发，预感到被他们加倍保护的牛鬼蛇神，就要被革命的人民像打扫垃圾一样，从社会主义戏剧舞台上清除掉，而革命现代戏骂又骂不倒，挡也挡不住，于是他们就耍尽花招，用“平起平坐”，“两条腿走路”作幌子，以达到他们最后把革命现代戏挤掉，扭转社会主义戏剧方向的罪恶目的。
    毛主席说：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”一九六四年，在毛泽东文艺思想的指导下举办的京剧现代戏观摩演出大会，高高举起了京剧革命的大旗，这就给田汉之流敲起了丧钟。无产阶级文化大革命的进一步兴起，使田汉之流更加惊慌失措，他们便采取种种阴谋手段企图负隅顽抗，垂死挣扎。但是，革命人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，终于把反革命修正主义分子田汉及其一伙揪出来了。只有把这些横在我们前进道路上的绊脚石一脚踢开，我们的社会主义的戏剧才能胜利地沿着毛主席指引的方向阔步前进！
