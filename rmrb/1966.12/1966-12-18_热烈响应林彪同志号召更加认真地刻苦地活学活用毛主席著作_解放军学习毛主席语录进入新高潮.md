The People's Liberation Army is in the midst of a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Following Comrade Lin Biao's repeated advocacy for studying Chairman Mao's quotations, the army has extensively launched activities to study Chairman Mao's quotations. Over the past few years, these study activities have become increasingly in-depth, widespread, and effective, with rich experiences accumulated. Through years of practice, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers have deeply felt that studying Chairman Mao's quotations by selecting them based on problems is an effective method for studying Mao Zedong Thought. They say: Studying quotations is the most convenient way to grasp fundamental viewpoints and link them with reality, the most effective way to emphasize key points, the most lively and vivid way, and the most convenient way for everyone to study, for everything to be studied, and for studying at all times. Wherever one goes, one studies and applies it there. This makes Mao Zedong Thought penetrate into every domain. Many soldiers regard the quotation book as the treasure among treasures, the standard for action, and the golden key to solving all problems.

After Comrade Lin Biao's preface to the reprinted edition of "Chairman Mao's Quotations" was published, all cadres and soldiers in the army resolutely responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call, determined to study Chairman Mao's quotations more seriously and diligently, and to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

The activities of studying Chairman Mao's quotations in various units began in 1960. At that time, Comrade Lin Biao called on the entire army to truly master Mao Zedong Thought and required all cadres and soldiers to repeatedly study many of Chairman Mao's fundamental viewpoints, memorize the most profound and important words from Chairman Mao's works, and repeatedly study and apply them. Following Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers carefully copied down aphorisms while reading Chairman Mao's books and memorized them. In 1961, the "Liberation Army Daily" began publishing Chairman Mao's quotations on its front page. Along with the appearance of quotation boards and quotation slogans in the units like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, cadres and soldiers eagerly cut out, copied, and circulated quotations, learning and applying them. In 1964, the General Political Department, following Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, compiled and published "Chairman Mao's Quotations." When this quotation book was distributed to the platoons, the soldiers treasured it like a precious gem, selecting outstanding soldiers to lead study groups and also serve as "custodians" of the quotation book. Many soldiers also used their spare time to neatly copy down the entire quotation book. When the reprinted edition was distributed, and the quotation book was issued to every cadre and soldier like weapons, many people were so excited that they hugged the quotation book and stayed up all night, repeatedly saying: This is the greatest care from the Party and Chairman Mao. With "Chairman Mao's Quotations," it's as if Chairman Mao is by our side, and Chairman Mao's words are in our ears. We can better listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

With the vigorous development of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, the army's activities to study Chairman Mao's quotations have surged to new heights. From platoons to leading organs, from soldiers to brigade and division cadres, everyone studies at all times and in all places. Both the illiterate and those with high cultural levels love to study. The entire army is a red sea of "Chairman Mao's Quotations," and everywhere you hear the resonant voices of reciting Chairman Mao's quotations. New forms of study that the masses love, such as using quotations in meetings, reciting quotations on the spot, exchanging quotations, consulting quotations when encountering problems, holding quotation study sessions and quotation evenings, have continuously emerged. Experiences of reading quotations, lecturing on quotations, memorizing quotations, and applying quotations have been promptly summarized and promoted. The cadres and soldiers, with deep feelings for the quotations, say: One quotation is like a pillar supporting the sky, one quotation is like a spiritual atomic bomb. Every word must be engraved in the mind, every sentence must be absorbed into the blood, and every action must be implemented in practice.

The broad masses of cadres and soldiers often organize activities to memorize quotations. They say: Chairman Mao's words are all truths, one sentence is worth ten thousand. To listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, one must first know what Chairman Mao has said and what instructions he has given. After understanding the great significance of memorizing Chairman Mao's quotations, the soldiers seize every opportunity to read and memorize quotations. After memorizing a large number of quotations, they have greatly promoted their ideological transformation and pushed forward the completion of various tasks. The platoon leader of a certain unit of the Railway Corps, Pang Meifeng, used to encounter problems and always tried to find answers in Chairman Mao's works. However, because he had not memorized Chairman Mao's teachings, he either couldn't find them or couldn't find them accurately, and thus couldn't timely solve his real ideological problems with Mao Zedong Thought. After memorizing a large number of Chairman Mao's quotations, he naturally thinks of Chairman Mao's instructions when he has ideological problems, applies the right medicine, corrects himself timely, and has achieved remarkable results on the road of ideological transformation. Many soldiers who have memorized a large number of Chairman Mao's quotations share their personal experiences: Memorizing Chairman Mao's quotations allows one to timely engage in ideological struggle when encountering problems and use Chairman Mao's words to guide one's thoughts and actions.

Chairman Mao said: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must be able to master it and apply it. The purpose of mastery is entirely for application." The broad masses of cadres and soldiers pay special attention to applying quotations when studying Chairman Mao's quotations. They say: The fundamental purpose of reading and memorizing quotations is to apply them. Memorizing a quotation means treating it as a motto, executing it unconditionally and resolutely, and letting it take effect at all times, in all matters, and in all places. The deputy squad leader of a certain unit of the Navy, Yang Waichao, heard that a soldier who enlisted later than him had become a squad leader, and he felt very unhappy. At this time, he recited a quotation from Chairman Mao that he had long memorized: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people. What bad things do we have that we are reluctant to give up?" He used Chairman Mao's teachings to compare and immediately engaged in a struggle against his erroneous thoughts, dispelling his selfish desires. The soldiers say: Memorizing a quotation, struggling against selfishness once, establishing public spirit once, advances one step in ideological transformation.

Memorizing Chairman Mao's quotations is for application. How can one achieve results? The experience of many units is: Based on the situation, tasks, the masses' ideological situation, and work situation, select appropriate quotations. A certain unit's 6th Platoon went on a field training exercise. Facing the real ideological problems in the field, they selected Chairman Mao's quotation: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," achieving good results. A certain unit of the Air Force, to combine studying quotations with real problems, mobilized the masses to find quotations based on problems, proposing many "think about everything," such as: When work is smooth, think "Humility makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind"; when receiving criticism, think "If we have shortcomings, we should not fear others pointing them out"; when personal interests conflict with collective interests, think "Completely" and "Thoroughly" serve the people; when encountering things one doesn't understand, think "Not understanding is not understanding, don't pretend to understand," etc., effectively promoting ideological transformation. Their experience is: Studying quotations without linking them to real problems will not achieve immediate results.

Another experience of achieving results is: Grasp a few of Chairman Mao's fundamental viewpoints and a few quotations, study and apply them repeatedly with focus, study them deeply and thoroughly. Many cadres and soldiers studying with the problem of ideological transformation say: Chairman Mao's quotations, though few in words, are profound in meaning. One must read them a hundred times, a thousand times, ten thousand times, and read them for a lifetime. The situation is developing, and thoughts are changing. Continuously combining new situations, studying diligently and practicing frequently, will continuously yield new understandings and new gains. The political commissar of a certain unit, An Rongmao, after being promoted from a general cadre to a leading cadre, grasped the quotation "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people" and repeatedly studied and applied it, finding it new and closer each time. He said, when promoted, studying this quotation, he realized that the position changed, but he was still a servant of the people. A servant of the people must be diligent in mind and action, not lazy, otherwise, he is not a servant of the people; when staying in the office for too long, studying this quotation, he realized that a servant of the people must timely be with the masses. Only by immersing oneself in reality and among the masses can one better serve the masses; when the masses give him special treatment, studying this quotation, he decided to put down his airs and share weal and woe with the masses. He proved with his practice that only by repeatedly studying with problems can one gradually deepen one's understanding and truly master and apply Mao Zedong Thought.

Currently, the army's activities to study Chairman Mao's quotations have entered a new high tide. Inside and outside the camps, quotations are written everywhere, soldiers carry quotations with them, reciting, lecturing, and applying quotations are ubiquitous in every airport, dock, border outpost, and unit station. The outstanding soldier Li Enbo hung a bright red quotation board on his bedhead and wrote a poem expressing his determination: "Red quotations hang by the bedhead, Chairman Mao teaches us every day: Serving the people is the most glorious, revolutionary soldiers remember it. Red quotations hang by the bedhead, Chairman Mao's words are heard every time: Never forget class struggle, continuously revolutionize one's thoughts. Red quotations hang by the bedhead, the heart is as vast as the universe, in the platoon looking at the world, ready to kill the enemy at any moment!"

    热烈响应林彪同志号召更加认真地刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作
    解放军学习毛主席语录进入新高潮
    指战员说：有了《毛主席语录》，好像毛主席就在身边，毛主席的话就在耳边。毛主席语录字虽少，意义深，要读百遍、千遍、万遍，读一辈子。一条语录就是一根擎天柱，一条语录就是一颗精神原子弹
    据新华社十七日讯　中国人民解放军在活学活用毛主席著作群众运动中，根据林彪同志一再提倡的关于学习毛主席语录的指示精神，广泛开展了学习毛主席语录的活动。几年来，这一学习活动越来越深入，越来越普及，越来越有成效，经验也越来越丰富。广大指战员从多年的实践中深深地体会到，带着问题选学毛主席语录，是一种学习毛泽东思想的好方法，最容易收到立竿见影的效果。他们说：学语录，最便于掌握基本观点和联系实际，最容易突出重点，最生动活泼，更便于人人学，事事学，时时学，走到哪里，学到哪里，用到哪里，使毛泽东思想深入到一切领域之中。许多战士称语录本是宝中宝，是行动的准则，解决一切问题的金钥匙。
    林彪同志为《毛主席语录》再版写的前言发表以后，全军指战员坚决响应林彪同志的号召，决心更加认真地、刻苦地学习毛主席语录，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新的阶段。
    各部队学习毛主席语录活动是从一九六○年开始的。当时，林彪同志号召全军一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手，并且要求全体指战员反复学习毛主席的许多基本观点，把毛主席著作中最精辟最重要的话背下来，反复学习，反复运用。广大指战员遵循林彪同志的指示，在读毛主席的书的时候，认真抄下警句，熟读熟记。一九六一年，《解放军报》在刊头上开始登载毛主席语录，随着部队中语录板、语录标语等像雨后春笋般地涌现出来，干部战士也争先恐后地剪语录，抄语录，传阅语录，学习和运用语录。一九六四年，总政治部根据林彪同志的指示，编印出版了《毛主席语录》，这个语录本一发到班里，战士们就如获至宝，纷纷选出优秀战士当学习小组长，兼当语录本“保管员”。许多战士还利用空隙时间，工工整整地把整本语录抄了下来。当语录本再版发行，并且像发武器一样发给每个干部战士时，许多人激动得把语录本抱在怀里，彻夜难眠，不断地说：这是党和毛主席对我们最大最大的关怀。有了《毛主席语录》，像毛主席就在身边，毛主席的话就在耳边。我们就能更好地听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事了。
    随着活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的蓬勃发展，全军学习毛主席语录的活动一浪高过一浪。从连队到领导机关，从战士到师团干部，时时学，处处学，文盲喜欢学，文化程度高的也爱学。整个部队到处是《毛主席语录》的红色海洋，到处是朗读毛主席语录的响亮声音。开会用语录、现场读语录、互相赠语录、遇到问题请教语录、开语录讲用会和语录晚会等新的群众喜闻乐见的学习形式不断出现；读语录、讲语录、背语录、用语录的新的行之有效的经验也在及时总结和推广。指战员们怀着对语录深厚的感情说：一条语录就是一根擎天柱，一条语录就是一颗精神原子弹，字字要刻在脑子里，句句要化在血液中，时时要落实在行动上。
    广大指战员在学习毛主席语录时，经常开展熟读熟记语录的活动。他们说：毛主席的话，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。要听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，首先要知道毛主席说过哪些话，作过哪些指示。战士们懂得熟读熟记毛主席语录的重大意义后，利用各种机会读语录、背语录。他们熟记大量语录以后，有力地促进了思想革命化，推动了各项任务的完成。铁道兵某部班长庞美峰过去遇到问题，总想从毛主席著作中找到答案，但由于没有把毛主席教导记熟，不是找不到，就是找不准，不能及时地用毛泽东思想解决自己的现实思想问题。熟记了大批毛主席语录以后，他有了思想问题就自然地想到毛主席的指示，对症下药，改正及时，在革命化的道路上取得了显著成绩。大批熟记毛主席语录的战士以自己切身的体会说：记住毛主席语录，遇到问题，就能及时开展思想斗争，用毛主席的话指挥自己的思想和行动。
    毛主席说：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”广大指战员在学习毛主席语录时，特别注意在用字上狠下功夫。他们说：读语录、背语录的根本目的在于用，背下一条语录就要把这条语录当作座右铭，不折不扣，坚决执行，坚决照办，让它时时、事事、处处起作用。海军某部副班长杨外潮听说比他入伍晚的一位战士当了班长，心里很不痛快。这时，他就背诵了一条早已熟记的毛主席语录：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，我们有些什么不好的东西舍不得丢掉呢？”他用毛主席的教导一对照，立即与错误思想作斗争，打消了私心杂念。战士们说：背一次语录，斗一次私字，立一次公字，在世界观改造上就前进一步。
    熟读熟记毛主席语录是为了用，怎样才能用出成效来？许多部队的经验是：针对着形势、任务、群众的思想情况和工作情况，选好语录。某部六连外出野营，针对野营中的现实思想问题，选了毛主席的
  “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”语录，取得很好的效果。空军某部为了使学语录与现实问题相结合，发动群众带着问题找语录，提出了许多“每事想”，如：工作顺利时，想“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”；受到批评时，想“我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出”；个人利益与集体利益发生矛盾时，想“完全”“彻底”为人民服务；遇到不懂的问题时，想“不懂就是不懂，不要装懂”等，有效地促进了思想革命化。他们的体会是：离开了现实问题学语录，就收不到立竿见影的效果。
    怎样才能用出成效来的另一个经验是：抓住毛主席的几个基本观点，几条语录，有重点的反复学反复用，学深学透。许多带着思想改造问题，十学两个“极端”，百学“毫不利己专门利人”的指战员说：毛主席语录字虽少，意义深，要百读，千读，万读，读一辈子。情况在发展，思想在变化，不断结合新情况，勤学多练，就会不断有新体会、新收获。某部政委安荣茂从一般干部提升为领导干部后，抓住“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”这条语录，反复学反复用，越学越新，越学越亲。他说，当职位提升时，学习这条语录，认识到职位变了，但还是人民勤务员，勤务员就要头脑勤、手脚勤，不能懒，懒了就不是勤务员；当在机关蹲久了时，学习这条语录，察觉到人民勤务员必须及时和群众在一起，只有深入实际，置身于群众之中，才能更好地为群众服务；当群众给自己特殊照顾时，学习这条语录，就决心放下架子，与群众同甘共苦。他以自己的实践证明，只有带着问题反复学，才能逐步加深认识，把毛泽东思想真正学懂，真正会用。
    目前，全军学习毛主席语录活动又进入了一个新的高潮。营区内外到处书写着语录，战士身上带着语录，背语录、讲语录、用语录遍及每个机场、码头、边防哨所和各部队驻地。五好战士李恩勃在自己床头挂上鲜红的语录牌，并且写了一首诗表达自己的决心，诗写道：“红红语录床头挂，毛主席天天教导咱：为人民服务最光荣，革命战士牢记它。红红语录床头挂，时时听到主席话：阶级斗争永不忘，思想不断革命化。红红语录床头挂，心胸远比宇宙大，身在连队望世界，时刻准备把敌杀！”
