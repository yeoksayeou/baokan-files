Chairman Mao, the Soviet people heartily adore you!

In the land of Leninism, where dark clouds are temporarily gathering, under the rule of the modern revisionist clique in the Soviet Union, the Soviet people, who have been nurtured by Lenin and Stalin, hold deep feelings and their hearts are with the center of the world revolution, Beijing, and with the great leader Chairman Mao. They say: Today's Soviet Union needs a second revolution. Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our time, and Mao Zedong Thought will bring us light!

Not long ago, according to the agreement between the China-Soviet Friendship Association and the Soviet Union, a delegation from the China-Soviet Friendship Association visited the Soviet Union. During the visit, the Soviet revisionist leadership blocked news of the delegation's arrival in the Soviet Union and obstructed the delegation's contact with the Soviet people in every way. However, in the short span of twenty days that the delegation was in the Soviet Union, many Soviet people, despite the risks of losing their jobs, being arrested, or imprisoned, broke through the numerous obstacles set up by the Soviet authorities to express their deep longing for Chairman Mao to their Chinese comrades and their revolutionary friendship with the Chinese people.

"Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" This is the most glorious name in the world, and it is also the name most beloved by the Soviet people. Whether in Moscow or Leningrad, whether in Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad) or Baku, wherever the China-Soviet Friendship Association delegation went in the Soviet Union, people often quietly approached the Chinese comrades, raised their thumbs, and softly but deeply called out, "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" Then they quickly left. Sometimes, only the voice calling "Mao Zedong" could be heard, but the person calling was nowhere to be seen. Some Soviet people saw the Chinese comrades wearing Chairman Mao's badges and looked at them with deep affection, pointing to the Chairman Mao badges on the Chinese comrades and then pointing to their own chests, expressing their love for Chairman Mao. The delegation brought some Chairman Mao badges and photographs of Chairman Mao to give to the Soviet people. When the Chinese comrades gave this most precious gift to the few Soviet friends they could contact, they eagerly kissed the photographs and badges of Chairman Mao, their faces showing boundless happiness.

We believe in Mao Zedong Thought

This was one morning during the delegation's visit to Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. Some members of the delegation were walking along a road by the Caspian Sea. A group of Soviet workers going to work approached them. When these workers realized that the people in front of them were Chinese comrades, they ignored the Soviet police watching from the side and gathered around, asking after Chairman Mao and the Chinese people, and requesting photographs and badges of Chairman Mao. They shook the Chinese comrades' hands tightly and for a long time, cheering enthusiastically. The deep revolutionary feelings between the peoples of the two countries bound everyone's hearts together.

At this moment, an old worker excitedly said to the Chinese comrades, "The working class of Baku loves Chairman Mao and the Chinese people. It's just that our government doesn't let us be friendly with China. Please convey our greetings to Chairman Mao! Please convey our greetings to the Chinese working class!" When a member of the delegation gave him a "May 7th" commemorative badge and told him that it was a commemorative badge of the Chinese workers' revolutionary movement, the old worker quietly said to the Chinese comrades, "I also participated in the revolutionary struggle in the past. But today, we need a second revolution here. We believe that Mao Zedong Thought can help us."

More and more people gathered on the road, eventually numbering over a hundred. Four Soviet police officers arrived on motorcycles and roughly dispersed the crowd. However, as soon as the police drove the people on one side away, the people on the other side gathered around again. The crowd was very angry, shouting in protest and refusing to leave. Some followed the Chinese comrades all the way to the hotel door. A driver excitedly said to the delegation members, "I am risking my life to talk to you. But I am not afraid of anything. I hope you can visit my home. Now, our lives lack a soul. I miss the past revolutionary life and miss Stalin. Today, there is still no Marxist-Leninist party here. Mao Zedong is the true Marxist-Leninist."

When the delegation went by ship to visit the Baku offshore oil field, the Soviet authorities arranged for them to spend eight hours on the ship for a round trip, while the visit to the oil field lasted only fifteen minutes. On the ship, the Soviet side deliberately separated the delegation from the Soviet workers. However, just as the delegation was about to disembark, the Soviet oil workers going to work encountered the Chinese comrades at the bow of the ship. The workers were full of enthusiasm and quickly surrounded the Chinese comrades, greeting the Chinese people warmly. When the delegation members distributed Chairman Mao badges and photographs of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards to them, a worker wearing an oil-stained work uniform held the badge of Chairman Mao high above his head and shouted loudly, "Long live Mao Zedong!" An old worker took the photograph of Chairman Mao, kissing it repeatedly and saying, "I will keep it as a permanent memento!" Some people carefully placed the photograph of Chairman Mao in the pocket of their inner clothing and gently stroked it again and again.

We miss Mao Zedong

One day, the delegation went to visit the Volga-Don Canal lock, a construction from the Stalin era. An old worker saw the Chinese delegation on the shore and came up to greet the Chinese comrades. A member of the delegation gave him a Chairman Mao badge. When the old worker learned that Chairman Mao was in good health, he repeatedly said happily, "That's great! That's great! I wish Mao Zedong well, we miss him very much." He also said, "Our lives are not good now. We miss Stalin." The old worker carefully wrapped the Chairman Mao badge in a handkerchief. When the Soviet side noticed the old man talking to the Chinese, they ran over to question him, but the old man ignored them and left. When the delegation members finished visiting the lock and returned by ship, they found the old man still sitting on the pier, waiting for the delegation members. He waved his hat repeatedly, greeting the Chinese comrades. The ship gradually moved away, and the old man's figure became blurred, but he was still waving his hat.

In Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad), one day the delegation went to visit the free market. A young boiler worker saw the delegation members wearing Chairman Mao badges and knew they were Chinese comrades. He immediately greeted the delegation members and requested a Chairman Mao badge, asking the Chinese comrades to pin it inside his clothing. He said, "It's not good to talk here, otherwise I will be arrested. I can only ask you to convey my greetings to Chairman Mao and the Chinese people." After saying this, he hurriedly left. When the delegation visited a factory in Moscow, a female worker also quietly approached the delegation members and said with deep emotion, "We love Chairman Mao!"

China is everything

Under the rule of the revisionist clique, the Soviet people deeply miss the revolutionary life and struggles of the past, yearn for China where the revolutionary banner is flying high, and hold deep revolutionary feelings for the Chinese people. In a hotel where the delegation stayed, a waitress said to the Chinese comrades, "We love the Chinese people, it's just that our leaders are not good, they are not friendly with China. But they cannot deceive us, we Soviet working people understand everything."

Indeed, the Soviet people cannot be deceived! During the delegation's visit to the Soviet Union, some Soviet people said to the Chinese comrades, "We cannot hear the voice of truth here. We long to hear the Chinese comrades talk about the situation in China and to have a heart-to-heart conversation with you!" On the day the delegation went to the Red Square in Moscow to pay their respects at Lenin's tomb, the Soviet authorities dispatched many police and spies to obstruct the Soviet masses from contacting the delegation. Even so, many Soviet people still came to talk to the Chinese comrades and take photos with them. A middle-aged woman from Siberia said to the delegation members, "I have seen Chinese people for the first time and talked to you, I am so happy! This trip to Moscow was not in vain. You are all such good people!" She called her two children over and let them see the Chairman Mao badge and recognize Chairman Mao. Another Soviet citizen also walked over and said, "China means everything to us, it is unimaginable to be unfriendly with China. The friendship between the peoples of the two countries cannot be destroyed by any force!"

Although the delegation of the China-Soviet Friendship Association has already left the Soviet Union and returned to China, the Soviet people's boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao will make them unable to forget for a long time. The delegation's experiences in the Soviet Union made them deeply believe that the dark clouds hovering over the Soviet land will surely disperse, just as a Soviet youth recently wrote in a letter to Chairman Mao, the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought will one day fly high above the Kremlin.

### 毛主席，苏联人民衷心爱戴您！

    毛主席，苏联人民衷心爱戴您！
    在一时乌云密布的列宁主义故乡，在现代修正主义集团当权的苏联国土上，受过列宁和斯大林哺育的苏联人民，怀着无比深厚的感情，心心向着世界革命的中心北京，心心向着伟大的领袖毛主席。他们说：今天的苏联需要第二次革命。毛泽东是当代的列宁，毛泽东思想将给我们带来光明！
    不久以前，按照中苏两国友协的协议，中苏友协代表团访问了苏联。在访问期间，苏联修正主义领导集团封锁代表团到达苏联的消息，百般阻挠代表团同苏联人民接触。但是，在代表团访问苏联的短短二十天中，许多苏联人却冒着失业、被捕、坐牢等种种危险，冲破苏联当局设下的重重障碍，向中国同志表达了他们日夜思念毛主席的无限深情，表达了他们对中国人民的革命友谊。
      “毛泽东！毛泽东！”这是全世界最光辉的名字，也是苏联人民最热爱的名字。不论是在莫斯科还是列宁格勒，不论是在伏尔加格勒（即原斯大林格勒）还是巴库，中苏友协代表团在苏联所到之处，常常有人悄悄地走到中国同志身边，翘起大拇指，轻声但又深情地叫一声：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”随后便快步离去。有的时候，只听见有人呼喊“毛泽东”的声音，却看不到喊的人藏在什么地方。有的苏联人看到中国同志胸前挂着毛主席像章，用深情的目光注视着，向着中国同志手指毛主席像章，又指指自己的胸口，表示他们对毛主席的热爱。代表团带去了一部分毛主席像章和毛主席照片，准备送给苏联人民。当中国同志把这最珍贵的礼物送给所能接触到的少数苏联朋友时，他们接过毛主席照片和毛主席像章，情不自禁地亲吻起来，脸上流露出无限幸福的表情。
      我们相信毛泽东思想
    这是代表团在阿塞拜疆首都巴库访问的一天清晨。代表团的部分团员，沿着里海边的一条马路散步，迎面走来了一群去上班的苏联工人。当这些工人知道了出现在他们前面的是中国同志的时候，不管苏联警察在一旁监视，一齐围拢上来，纷纷问候毛主席，问候中国人民，向中国同志要毛主席照片和毛主席像章。他们紧紧握着中国同志的双手，久久地摇动着，热情地欢叫着。中苏两国人民深厚的革命感情，把人们的心都紧紧地联结在一起了。
    这时候，有一位老工人激动地对中国同志说：“巴库工人阶级热爱毛主席，热爱中国人民，就是我们的政府不让我们对中国友好。请向毛主席问好！请向中国工人阶级问好！”代表团一位团员把一枚“二七”纪念章送给他，并且告诉他这是中国工人革命运动的纪念章时，这位老工人又悄悄地对中国同志说：“我过去也参加过革命斗争。但是，今天我们这里需要第二次革命。我们相信，毛泽东思想能帮助我们。”
    马路上人越来越多，最后聚集了上百人。四个苏联警察骑着摩托车赶来，粗暴地驱赶群众。但是，警察刚把这边的人们赶开，那边的人们又围拢了上来。群众很气愤，纷纷发出不满的叫声，怎么也不肯离开。有的人跟着中国同志，一直把代表团的同志送到旅馆门前。一位汽车司机激动地对代表团的同志说：“我冒着生命危险和你们说话。但是，我什么也不怕，我希望你们能到我家去作客。现在，我们的生活中缺少灵魂。我怀念过去的革命生活，怀念斯大林。今天，我们这里还没有一个马克思列宁主义政党。毛泽东才是真正的马克思列宁主义者。”这位普通劳动者说出了广大苏联人民的心里话。
    代表团乘船去参观巴库海上油田的时候，苏联当局安排他们来回坐了八个小时的船，而在油田的参观只有十五分钟。在船上，苏方人员还故意把代表团和苏联工人隔开。但是，就在代表团下船的时候，上班的苏联石油工人和中国同志在船头相遇了。工人们热情洋溢，很快把中国同志围了起来，非常亲切地向中国人民问好。代表团团员把毛主席像章和毛主席接见红卫兵的照片分送给他们时，一位穿着满是油污的工作服的工人，把毛主席像举过头顶，放声高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”有位老工人接过毛主席照片，一面连连亲吻，一面说：“我要留作永久的纪念！”有的人把毛主席照片小心翼翼地放到贴身的衣服口袋里，还一次又一次地轻轻抚摸着。
      我们想念毛泽东
    一天，代表团去参观斯大林时代建筑的伏尔加—顿河运河水闸。一位老工人见到中国代表团在岸上，他也上了岸，走过来和中国同志打招呼。代表团的一位同志把一枚毛主席像章送给他。当这位老工人知道毛主席身体很健康，非常高兴地连声说：“那太好了！太好了！祝毛泽东好，我们很想念他。”他还说：“我们现在的生活不好。我们思念斯大林。”老工人小心翼翼地把毛主席像章用手绢包了起来。苏方人员发现老人在和中国人讲话，就跑过来追问，老人理也不理他们，扬长而去。代表团同志们参观完水闸乘船返回时，发现老人仍然坐在桥墩上，等着代表团的同志们。他摇动着帽子，一再向中国同志致意。船渐渐地走远了，老人的身影模糊了，但他仍在摇动着手中的帽子。
    在伏尔加格勒（即原斯大林格勒），代表团有一天去参观自由市场。一位青年锅炉工人看到代表团同志们胸前戴着毛主席像章，知道他们是中国同志，立即就向代表团同志问好，要求送给他一枚毛主席像章，并请求中国同志为他戴在里面的衣服上。他说：“这里不好讲话，不然我就要被捕，我只能请你们转达我对毛主席和中国人民的问候。”说完，他匆匆地走了。代表团在莫斯科参观一个工厂的时候，一位女工也悄悄地走到代表团同志们身旁，深情地说：“我们热爱毛主席！”
      中国就是一切
    在修正主义集团统治下的苏联人民，无限怀念着以往革命年代的生活和斗争，向往着高高飘扬着革命旗帜的中国，对中国人民怀着深厚的革命友情。在代表团住过的一个饭店里的一位服务员，对中国同志说：“我们热爱中国人民，就是我们的领导不好，不和中国友好。但是，他们欺骗不了我们，我们苏联劳动人民什么都懂得。”
    是的，苏联人民是骗不了的！在代表团访问苏联期间，有些苏联人就对中国同志说：“我们在这里听不到真理的声音，我们多么想听到中国同志谈谈中国情况，多想和你们谈谈心啊！”代表团到莫斯科红场去拜谒列宁墓的那天，苏联当局派了许多警察和密探，多方阻挡苏联群众和代表团接触。就是这样，许多苏联人还是跑来和中国同志交谈，同中国同志一起照像。一位来自西伯利亚的中年妇女对代表团的同志说：“我第一次见到了中国人，和你们谈了话，我太高兴了！我这趟莫斯科没白来。你们都是多么好的人啊！”说着，她把自己的两个孩子叫过来，让他们看毛主席像章，认认毛主席。另一个苏联公民也走过来说：“中国对我们来说就是一切，不能设想和中国不友好。苏中两国人民的友谊是任何力量也破坏不了的！”
    中苏友协代表团虽然已经离开苏联返回中国了，但苏联人民对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，却使他们久久不能忘怀。同志们在苏联的所见所闻使他们深深地相信：笼罩苏联大地的乌云必将驱散，正像不久前一位苏联青年在写给毛主席的一封信中说的，伟大的毛泽东思想的旗帜，总有一天将高高飘扬在克里姆林宫的上空。
