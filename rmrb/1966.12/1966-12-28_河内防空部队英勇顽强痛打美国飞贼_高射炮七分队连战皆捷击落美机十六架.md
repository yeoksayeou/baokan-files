The brave air defense forces of the People's Army of Vietnam, who are defending the capital Hanoi, have recently launched a campaign to learn from the exemplary performance of the 7th Battery of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit. The campaign aims to foster a spirit of courage and tenacity, and to strike more fiercely and accurately against American air pirates.

The 7th Battery of this anti-aircraft artillery unit is a highly distinguished hero unit. In 36 battles against American air pirates, they have shot down 16 enemy aircraft, achieving a record of victory in every engagement. For their outstanding achievements, they have been awarded a First-Class Meritorious Service Medal and two Third-Class Meritorious Service Medals, and have been commended multiple times.

This battery places great emphasis on political and ideological work during both training and combat. They continuously strengthen the education of their personnel, fostering a deep hatred for American imperialism and instilling a spirit of revolutionary heroism that is fearless of hardship and sacrifice. They recognize that the decisive factor in the outcome of the war is the people, not the weapons.

They also diligently practice their combat skills, mastering the tactics and techniques of anti-aircraft warfare. Their goal is to ensure that "no matter how low, high, or maneuvering the American pirate aircraft fly, they will be hit."

Currently, a campaign to learn from the 7th Battery's combat training is vigorously underway in the air defense forces of Hanoi.

Soldiers from various units have expressed their determination to follow the example of the 7th Battery, further enhancing their combat will and skills, to shoot down more American pirate aircraft and defend the capital.

The Liaison Mission of the General Staff of the People's Army of Vietnam strongly protested on December 25 that American pirate aircraft had continued to violate the airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on December 24 and 25, conducting reconnaissance and harassment activities over Hanoi and many other places.

The Liaison Mission stated that the blatant aggressive actions of American imperialism over these two days clearly show that the United States is stubbornly preparing for a new escalation of the war, aiming to savagely bomb the residential areas of North Vietnam.

    河内防空部队英勇顽强痛打美国飞贼
    高射炮七分队连战皆捷击落美机十六架
    新华社河内二十七日电　英勇保卫着首都的河内市人民军防空部队，最近号召全军大力开展向高射炮某部第七分队学习运动，发挥英勇顽强的战斗精神，更狠、更猛、更准地打击美国空中强盗。
    高射炮某部第七分队是一支打得很出色的英雄部队，它在同美国空中强盗进行的三十六次战斗中，共击落美国强盗飞机十六架，创造了连战皆捷的光辉战绩，因而荣获领导机关奖给一级战功勋章一枚和三级战功勋章两枚，受到多次表扬。
    这个分队在练兵和战斗中都很重视政治思想工作，不断加强全体指战员对美帝国主义仇恨的教育，使他们进一步树立不怕艰苦、不怕牺牲的革命英雄主义精神和认识到战争胜败的决定因素是人而不是武器。
    他们还苦练杀敌本领，熟练地掌握对空作战的战术技术，力求实现“不管美国强盗飞机低飞、高飞或者机动俯冲，也要打中它”的决心。
    目前，一个学习第七分队的战斗练兵运动正在河内市防空部队中热烈展开。
    各部队的指战员都纷纷表示要以第七分队为榜样，进一步提高战斗意志和战斗本领，以便击落更多美国强盗飞机，保卫首都。
    新华社河内二十五日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团二十五日强烈抗议美国强盗飞机在二十四日和二十五日两天中，继续侵犯越南民主共和国领空，对河内和其它许多地方进行侦察骚扰活动。
    联络代表团指出，美帝国主义这两天的明目张胆的侵略行动，清楚地表明美国仍然顽固地为新的战争“升级”作准备，以便野蛮地轰炸越南北方的居民区。
