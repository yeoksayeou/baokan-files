In revolutionary Africa, more and more people are enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's personally initiated and led Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards who have emerged in this great revolution.

A journalist from Guinea recently said in Conakry: "The Cultural Revolution currently being carried out in China is an unprecedented great revolutionary movement. This is a genius creation by Chairman Mao. Today, Chairman Mao has become the undisputed greatest leader of the world revolution. We are firmly convinced that this revolution will achieve complete victory."

A young worker from Guinea told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has shaken the world. This revolution has opened up a broad path for the people of all countries to achieve final victory over imperialism and revisionism." He said, "The Red Guards are indeed the defenders of great Mao Zedong Thought. They have provided us with an excellent example worthy of learning for carrying out the revolution."

A friend from Guinea, after visiting the exhibition of photographs from the Dazhai Production Brigade of Dazhai People's Commune currently held in Conakry, wrote in the guestbook: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao will be recorded as one of the most decisive stages in history. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great victory. He said, "This brilliant victory illuminates the world, lighting up the glorious and victorious path of struggle for the people of all countries advancing towards the Mao Zedong era of socialism."

A worker from Mali said, "The Red Guards are a good organization. The Red Guards are fighting against old ideas and defending China's socialist revolution." Another friend from Mali said, "The Cultural Revolution and the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards will make China advance more rapidly on the road of socialist revolution."

Recently, the famous scholar from Tanzania, Muhammad Ali Hamidi, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that China is the center of the world revolution today. The victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution has set a good example for the revolutionary people of Asia and Africa. If we do not thoroughly purge imperialist and colonialist ideas in the cultural sphere, then we cannot completely defeat American imperialism and old and new colonialism.

The national organ of the Congolese National Revolutionary Movement, the newspaper *Combat*, published an article saying: "The Red Guards are the shock troops of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Without such a massive mass movement, it is impossible to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in a profound, fundamental, and thorough manner."

A teacher from Somalia recently wrote a letter to the Chinese Red Guards in Mogadishu: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, Red Guards, we congratulate you on every revolutionary action you have taken to defend the fruits of the revolution."

The teacher's letter said: "We stand with you on the same front, resolutely opposing imperialism, colonialism, reactionaries, and the modern revisionists who are running dogs of American imperialism." The letter continued: In this cultural revolution, you have thoroughly exposed all the evil conspiracies of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. Through this revolution, your country will not fall into the hands of reactionaries and revisionists, and there will be no restoration of capitalism.

The letter pointed out that imperialists and revisionists attack China and the Chinese Cultural Revolution because this revolution has frightened them. Because "Beijing is the heart of all revolutionary forces of the oppressed people of the world."

    非洲人民热烈颂扬文化大革命是毛主席的天才创举
    红卫兵是伟大的毛泽东思想的捍卫者
    中国文化大革命的辉煌胜利照亮了各国人民的战斗道路
    新华社讯　在革命风雷激的非洲，越来越多的人民热情颂扬毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命和在这个伟大革命中涌现的红卫兵。
    几内亚一位新闻工作者最近在科纳克里说：“正在中国深入开展的文化大革命，是史无前例的伟大的革命运动。这是毛主席的一个天才的创造。今天毛主席已成为世界革命的无可争辩的最伟大的导师。我们深信，这场革命必将获得完全的胜利。”
    一位几内亚青年工人对新华社记者说：“中国的无产阶级文化大革命震动了全世界。这场革命为各国人民取得对帝国主义和修正主义的最后胜利开辟了广阔的道路。”他说：“红卫兵不愧是伟大的毛泽东思想的捍卫者。他们向我们提供了进行革命的值得学习的好榜样。”
    一位几内亚朋友在参观了目前在科纳克里举行的中国大寨人民公社大寨生产大队图片展览会以后，在留言簿上写道：由毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命将作为最具有决定性意义的社会阶段之一而载入史册。无产阶级文化大革命的胜利是伟大的胜利。他说：“这个辉煌的胜利普照全世界，照亮了向毛泽东时代的社会主义迈进的各国人民的光辉和胜利的战斗道路。”
    马里一位工人说：“红卫兵是一个好组织。红卫兵为反对旧思想和捍卫中国的社会主义革命而进行斗争。”另一位马里朋友说：“文化大革命和红卫兵的革命行动将使中国在社会主义革命的道路上更迅速地前进。”
    坦桑尼亚著名学者穆罕默德·阿里·赫迈迪最近向新华社记者说，中国是今天世界革命的中心。中国文化大革命的胜利，为亚非两大洲革命人民树立了好榜样。如果在文化上不肃清帝国主义和殖民主义思想，那么我们就不能彻底击败美帝国主义和新老殖民主义。
    刚果（布）全国革命运动机关报《战斗报》发表文章说：“红卫兵是毛泽东思想哺育下的无产阶级文化大革命的突击队。没有这样巨大规模的群众运动，就不能深刻地、根本地、彻底地进行无产阶级文化大革命。”
    索马里一位教师最近在摩加迪沙写信给中国红卫兵说：毛主席领导下的红卫兵们，我们祝贺你们“为了保卫革命成果而采取的每一个革命行动”。
    这位教师写的信说：“我们同你们站在一条阵线上，坚决反对帝国主义、殖民主义、反动派和美帝国主义的帮凶现代修正主义。”这封信接着说：在这场文化革命中，你们彻底地揭露了帝国主义、修正主义和反动派的一切罪恶阴谋。通过开展这场革命，你们的国家就不会落到反动派和修正主义分子手里，就不会发生资本主义复辟。
    这封信指出，帝国主义者和修正主义者攻击中国和中国的文化大革命，是因为这场革命把他们吓得发抖，因为“北京是世界被压迫人民的一切革命力量的心脏。”（附图片）
