Since the beginning of November, the brave and skilled liberation armed forces of South Vietnam have been galloping across the battlefield in South Vietnam, bravely fighting the enemy, and achieving brilliant results. They have opened the victorious curtain of the dry season battle for this winter and next spring, giving a heavy blow to the "dry season counteroffensive" plan that the American aggressors had long prepared.

The liberation armed forces launched more extensive attacks in November than in the previous month. From the northern province of Quang Tri to the southern Cape St. Jacques, from the coastal provinces to the central highlands, from the provinces surrounding Saigon to the city of Saigon itself, the sounds of guns and cannons from the liberation army, local forces, and guerrillas could be heard everywhere, striking fear and chaos into the American puppet forces.

At the beginning of November, the American aggressors mobilized 30,000 to 40,000 American and puppet troops, concentrating a large number of mechanized units, attempting to annihilate the main forces of the liberation armed forces in the provinces of Quang Tri, Pleiku, and Binh Dinh. However, during their large-scale troop movements, they suffered heavy blows, and their so-called "dry season counteroffensive" was disrupted from the start. The military and civilians in Quang Tri fought the most brilliantly. From the 3rd to the 21st, they annihilated more than 3,000 enemy troops. The forward command post of the American troops participating in this "sweeping operation" and the base of the 196th Brigade were both successively bombarded by the liberation armed forces, suffering heavy losses and casualties. In the strategically important central highlands province of Kontum, the liberation armed forces also successively annihilated entire battalions and companies of the enemy.

In November, the liberation armed forces not only strengthened their attack activities on the main battlefields but also bravely and intelligently penetrated deep into the enemy's rear, especially into the heart of the American puppet group's territory—Saigon and its surrounding areas to strike the enemy. On the first day of November, the liberation armed forces bombarded for the first time the site of the puppet "national day" review in the center of Saigon, causing the enemy to fall into chaos, killing and wounding more than 250 enemy troops on the spot. On November 17, the liberation armed forces once again struck the three large ammunition depots of the American logistics base in Phu Loi, Binh Duong Province, north of Saigon, with fierce artillery fire, severely damaging an American company and a platoon, destroying 154,000 artillery shells and rockets, 3,500 boxes of explosives, and many vehicles. Since the beginning of November, the liberation armed forces have also continuously attacked the American airbase in O Long Vinh, Binh Duong Province, west of Saigon, three times, and the American armored vehicle units in Binh Duong Province twice, all achieving significant results.

The liberation armed forces' attacks in November were aimed at the main mobile forces of the American aggressors. Therefore, the American mobile troops, which had just begun the dry season operations, were generally hit hard. In Quang Tri Province, the U.S. 196th Light Infantry Brigade, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, the 25th Infantry Division, and the 173rd Airborne Brigade participating in the large "sweeping operation," and the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, the 4th Infantry Division, the 101st Airborne Brigade, and the Marine Corps in the central region were all successively hit hard by the liberation army. In particular, the U.S. 196th Light Infantry Brigade, which was newly established after ten months of "counter-guerrilla warfare" training to adapt to the mountainous terrain of South Vietnam, suffered a heavy defeat as soon as it arrived on the battlefield in Quang Tri, South Vietnam. Many of its units were almost completely annihilated, and its brigade commander was dismissed and made a scapegoat.

The brilliant achievements of the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces in November indicate that the situation on the battlefield in South Vietnam is excellent, and the military and civilians of South Vietnam firmly grasp the initiative on the battlefield. The flames of the people's war are burning more fiercely. Although U.S. imperialism has increased the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam from more than 160,000 at the beginning of last winter's dry season to the current 360,000, it still cannot extricate itself from the quagmire.

Chairman Mao has said, "U.S. imperialism will eventually be driven out of South Vietnam." This is the inevitable fate of the American aggressors who are enemies of the Vietnamese people. In the face of the boundless power of the people's war in South Vietnam, the American aggressors will move from failure to greater failure until they are driven out of South Vietnam.

    南越军民揭开旱季战斗胜利序幕
    近一个月广泛出击杀敌战果辉煌
    据新华社三十日讯　本社记者报道：从十一月初以来，英勇善战的越南南方解放武装力量在南越战场上纵横驰骋，勇猛杀敌，取得了辉煌的战果，揭开了（南越）今冬明春旱季战斗的胜利序幕，给予美国侵略强盗准备已久的“旱季反攻”计划以迎头痛击。
    解放武装力量十一月份比上一月份发动了更为广泛的袭击。从北部的广治省到南部金瓯角，从沿海各省到中部高原，从西贡周围的各省到西贡市区，到处响起了解放军、地方军队和游击队的枪炮声，打得美伪军惶惶不安，狼狈不堪。
    十一月初，美国侵略者出动三、四万名美伪军，集中了大量机械化部队，企图在西宁、土龙木和边和三省消灭解放武装力量主力部队。但是就在他们大规模调兵遣将的过程中，就遭到了沉重打击，所谓“旱季反攻”的步子一开始就给打乱了。西宁省军民打得最漂亮。从三日到二十一日止，他们共歼灭敌人三千余名。参加这次“扫荡”的美军前方指挥所和一九六旅的基地，都相继遭到解放武装力量的炮轰，损失和伤亡惨重。在具有战略意义的中部高原地区的昆嵩省，解放武装力量也先后整营、整连地全歼敌人。
    解放武装力量在十一月份不仅加强了主要战场的袭击活动，而且英勇机智地深入敌后，特别是深入到美伪集团的心脏地区——西贡和西贡周围地区打击敌人。在十一月的头一天，解放武装力量第一次炮轰了美伪集团在西贡市中心举行的伪“国庆”检阅场地，打得敌人一片混乱，当场打死打伤敌军二百五十多人。十一月十七日，解放武装力量再次以猛烈炮火击中了西贡北面边和省的平龙美军后勤基地的三座大军火库，重创美军一个营和一个排，击毁炮弹、火箭十五万四千枚，炸药三千五百多箱，军车多辆。从十一月初以来，解放武装力量还连续三次袭击了西贡西北土龙木省的油汀美军机场，连续两次袭击边和省美军装甲车部队，都取得了重大战果。
    解放武装力量十一月份打击的矛头针对美国侵略军的主要机动力量。因此，使刚开始投入旱季作战的美军机动部队普遍挨打。在西宁省，参加大“扫荡”的美国第一九六轻步兵旅、美国第一步兵师、第二十五步兵师和第一七三空降旅，在中部中区的美国第一骑兵师、第四步兵师、第一○一空降旅和海军陆战队等都先后挨了解放军铁拳的痛击。特别是为适应南越山林战场、经过十个月“反游击战争”训练而新成立的美国第一九六轻步兵旅，刚到了南越西宁战场就吃了大败仗，它的许多单位几乎被全部歼灭，因而它的旅长被撤职，当了替罪羊。
    越南南方解放武装力量十一月份取得的辉煌战果表明，南越战场上的形势大好，南越军民牢牢地掌握着战场的主动权，人民战争的烈火越烧越旺。尽管美帝国主义把侵越美军人数从去年冬天旱季开始时十六万多人增加到目前的三十六万人，但是仍然无法使美帝国主义摆脱深陷泥潭的困境。
    毛主席说过，“美帝国主义终将从越南南方滚出去”。这是与越南人民为敌的美国侵略者的必然下场。在越南南方人民战争的无穷威力面前，美国侵略者将从失败走向更大的失败，直至滚出越南南方。
