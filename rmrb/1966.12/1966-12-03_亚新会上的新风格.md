	These days, the first Asian New Force Games have seen frequent victories, with athletes from various countries displaying even more ardent fighting spirits and deepening friendships. The precious new style and spirit shown by athletes from the Asian New Forces have left a lasting impression on the audience.

	High-Minded Style, Audience Moved

	The world-class badminton team final is taking place between athletes from China and Cambodia. In the third doubles match, a thrilling confrontation unfolded. Cambodia's Sarim and Mechabbin struck the ball like a barrage, aiming for the back corners, while China's Fang Kaiqiang and Zheng Qingjin skillfully returned each shot. To win a point, both sides often exchanged blows eight or nine times, making the tense and exciting match heart-pounding. When China led 14-10 in the first set, the scorer, engrossed in the game, mistakenly displayed 14-11. Sarim glanced back, saw the extra point, and immediately requested a correction. Similarly, in the second set, China's Zheng Qingjin won a point, but he noticed he had hit the ball twice with his racket, which the referee didn't see. He promptly informed the referee of his foul, giving the serve to the opposing team.

	Such displays of the high-minded spirit of Asian New Force athletes have repeatedly appeared on various competition fields, deeply moving the audience. Each time, the entire stadium erupted in enthusiastic applause.

	Close Cooperation, Like Brothers

	In the men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles table tennis matches, nine pairs were composed of male and female athletes from seven countries. Among them, the men's doubles pair of Zhang Xianlin from China and Cambodian star Jiang Chunan, and the mixed doubles pair of Li Fuyong from China and Cambodian female athlete Lada Na Phak, both advanced through multiple rounds, securing third place in men's doubles and mixed doubles respectively. These athletes from various countries cooperated closely during the matches, like brothers and sisters, vividly embodying the friendly and united spirit of Asian New Force athletes, becoming a highlight of this table tennis competition.

	Tenacious and Clever, Daring to Fight

	On the morning of November 29, the Lao and Syrian volleyball teams engaged in a fierce battle. Although the Lao team, participating in an international competition for the first time, lost 0-3, their tenacious fighting style left a deep impression on the audience.

	The Syrian volleyball team, with an average height of over 1.7 meters, was rich in competitive experience. Facing such a strong opponent, the Lao volleyball team, with an average height of less than 1.6 meters, demonstrated tenacity, cleverness, and a daring fighting spirit. When the Syrian team launched fierce spikes, the Lao team organized a tight defense and often saved critical balls with diving saves. When the Lao team's spikes were blocked by the opponent's net, they unexpectedly used clever lobs to score. Due to the Lao team's tenacious and clever play, the match saw frequent tie scores. The three sets lasted for one and a half hours.

	The head of the Lao Patriotic Front Sports Association delegation said after the match that the Lao volleyball team's tenacious fighting style was forged in the struggle against American imperialism.

    亚新会上的新风格
    这些天来，第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会上捷报频传，各国选手们在比赛中斗志更加昂扬，相互的友谊也有了进一步的发展。亚洲新兴力量运动员所表现的可贵的新风格、新精神，给观众留下了难忘的印象。
    风格高尚　观众感动
    具有世界水平的羽毛球团体决赛正在中、柬两国运动员之间进行着，第三盘双打中出现了全场瞩目的精彩对峙。柬埔寨的沙礼曼和麦沙宾像连珠炮般的将球猛扣后场两角，中国的方凯祥和郑青金以巧妙的姿势一一挡回，为争夺一分，双方常常要把球来回抽杀八九次，紧张而精彩的比赛，扣人心弦。当第一局打到中国队以十四比十领先时，记分员因为看得入神，竟将积分牌错挂为十四比十一。沙礼曼回头一瞅，看见自己平白多了一分，立刻要求校正。同样，中国队的郑青金在第二局比赛里，赢得了一分，但他在打这个球时球拍连击两下，裁判没有发现，他马上趋前告诉裁判自己犯了规，发球权应归对方。
    类似这样的表现亚洲新兴力量运动员高尚的精神面貌的动人场面，在各个比赛场上不断出现，使观众深受感动，每一次全场都报以热烈的掌声。
    密切合作　亲如兄弟
    在乒乓球男子双打、女子双打和男女混合双打比赛中，有九对是由七个国家的男女选手组成的。其中由中国的张燮林和柬埔寨名将江楚南组成的一对男子双打，中国的李富勇和柬埔寨女选手拉达娜·帕花组成的一对混合双打，都连闯数关，分别获得男子双打和混合双打第三名。这些国家的选手在比赛中密切合作，亲如兄弟姐妹，鲜明地体现了亚洲新兴力量运动员之间的友好团结精神，成为这次乒乓球比赛场上的美谈。
    顽强机智　敢于斗争
    十一月二十九日上午，老挝和叙利亚排球队进行了一场十分激烈的争夺战。第一次参加国际比赛的老挝队虽然以零比三失利，但是他们的顽强战斗风格却给观众留下了深刻的印象。
    叙利亚排球队员平均身高一米七十以上，又富有比赛经验。面对这样一个强手，平均身高不到一米六十的老挝排球队员表现了顽强机智，敢于斗争的战斗精神。叙利亚队不断猛烈扣杀，老挝队就严密组织防卫，并且多次用鱼跃救起险球。老挝队员的扣杀经常被对方拦网截住，他们就出其不意，采用巧妙的吊球得分。由于老挝队员打得顽强机智，场上不断出现平局。三局比赛共进行了一个半钟头。
    老挝爱国战线党体育协会代表团团长在比赛结束后说，老挝排球队员这种顽强的战斗风格，就是在反对美帝国主义的斗争中锻炼出来的。
