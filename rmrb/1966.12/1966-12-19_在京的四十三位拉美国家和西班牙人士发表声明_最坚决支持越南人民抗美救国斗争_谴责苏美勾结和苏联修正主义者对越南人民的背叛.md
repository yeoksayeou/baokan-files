	In Beijing, forty-three individuals from Latin American countries and Spain issued a statement expressing their most resolute support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and condemning the collusion between the Soviet Union and the United States, as well as the betrayal of the Vietnamese people by Soviet revisionists.

	Xinhua News Agency, December 18th: The people of Beijing, from various sectors, held a rally to condemn U.S. imperialism's bombing of Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, and to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. They received a statement of support and solidarity from forty-three individuals from Latin American countries and Spain who are working in Beijing. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	On this significant day, we express our most resolute support and solidarity to the brave warriors of the Vietnamese people who are fighting on the front lines and in the rear. They have shown the world that U.S. imperialism is merely a paper tiger.

	We celebrate the victories of the entire Vietnamese people in their heroic struggle to drive out the U.S. imperialist invaders from their soil, just as we would celebrate our own victories. We know that their heroism is boundless, and their victory is imminent.

	Our people, who are suffering under the oppression, exploitation, and aggression of U.S. imperialism, see their ancestral lands being trampled upon by the criminal and tyrannical U.S. Marines, both in the past and present. They understand that only by taking up arms and fighting U.S. imperialism head-on, like the Vietnamese people, can they achieve victory. They understand that only by waging a people's war, like the Vietnamese people, can they rid themselves of the most brutal exploitation in history and free themselves from the slavery of U.S. imperialism.

	Today, we fully support the Four-Point Proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Five-Point Declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Call to Arms" issued on July 17, 1966; these are the only paths to victory. All Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries around the world support this.

	Based on the above principles, we believe that the Vietnamese issue is the touchstone for distinguishing true friends from false friends, and true revolutionaries from traitors to the revolutionary cause. Therefore, we expose and oppose any form of "peace talks," regardless of their origin, because such "peace talks" are purely a conspiracy. They are used by U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists to deceive and betray the Vietnamese people, attempting to save our common enemy—U.S. imperialism.

	Therefore, we condemn the collusion between the Soviet Union and the United States aimed at dominating the world, and their betrayal of the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people and the struggles of the people around the world. We condemn the "united action" advocated by Soviet revisionists because they attempt to deceive the people and cover up the true face of modern revisionist traitors.

	We believe that all true Marxist-Leninists, in supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world, should raise two banners: the banner of opposing U.S. imperialism and the banner of opposing modern revisionists.

	As foreign workers in China, we support the correct stance of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people. We are ready to take necessary actions at any time, together with the Chinese people, to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and for national salvation.

	As revolutionaries from Latin America and Spain, we pledge to provide all possible assistance to the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people, together with our people.

	On this glorious day, we express our warmest support to the Vietnamese people. We are confident that victory will be ours and yours. We remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "We are now in a new and great era of world revolution. The revolutionary storms in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will certainly deliver a decisive and destructive blow to the old world. The great victory of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and for national salvation is a powerful proof of this. The proletariat and working people of Europe, North America, and Oceania are awakening anew. The gravediggers of U.S. imperialism and all other harmful elements have already been prepared, and their days of being buried will not be long."

	Long live the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. imperialism and for national salvation!

	We oppose all forms of "peace talks" and all "united actions" with modern revisionists!

	We will take all more effective measures to support the Vietnamese people!

	Long live the struggle and people's war of the people of Latin America and Spain!

	Long live the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, which is waging an anti-U.S. struggle!

	Down with modern revisionism led by the Soviet Communist Party leadership!

	Down with U.S. imperialism, the common enemy of the people of the world!

	Long live the great and respected leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh!

	Long live Marxism-Leninism!

	Long live the great thought of Mao Zedong!

	From forty-three individuals from Brazil, Peru, Haiti, Ecuador, Colombia, Spain, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and other countries.

    在京的四十三位拉美国家和西班牙人士发表声明
    最坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争
    谴责苏美勾结和苏联修正主义者对越南人民的背叛
    新华社十八日讯　首都各界人民声讨美帝轰炸越南首都河内和庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立六周年大会，收到了在北京工作的四十三位拉丁美洲国家和西班牙人士发表的支持和声援英雄的越南人民的声明。声明全文如下：
    在这个具有伟大意义的日子，我们谨向手持武器战斗在前线和后方的英勇的越南人民的战士们，表示我们最坚决的支持和声援。他们向全世界表明了美帝国主义只不过是一只纸老虎。
    我们像祝贺我们自己的胜利一样，祝贺全体越南人民在他们为把美帝国主义侵略者赶出自己国土的英勇斗争中所取得的胜利。我们知道他们的英雄主义是无限的，他们的胜利即将到来。
    我们的人民，正处在水深火热之中，正遭受着美帝国主义的压迫、剥削和侵略，他们看到自己祖国的国土在过去和现在都受着罪恶多端、横行霸道的美国海军陆战队的蹂躏。他们懂得，只有像越南人民一样拿起武器同美帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争，才能取得胜利。他们懂得，只有像越南人民一样进行一场人民战争，才能摆脱有史以来的最残忍的剥削，才能摆脱美帝国主义的奴役。
    今天，我们表示完全支持越南民主共和国四项主张，越南南方民族解放阵线五点声明，和胡志明主席在一九六六年七月十七日发出的“号召书”；这些是取得胜利的唯一道路。全世界所有的马克思列宁主义者和革命者都表示支持。
    根据上述标准，我们认为，越南问题是今天分别真朋友和假朋友，真革命者和革命事业的叛徒的试金石。因此我们揭露和反对不论从何处而来的、任何形式的“和谈”，因为这种“和谈”纯粹是个阴谋，因为它是美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者用来欺骗和背叛越南人民，企图拯救我们的共同敌人——美帝国主义的。
    因此，我们谴责苏美旨在主宰世界的苏美勾结和对越南人民的英勇斗争的背叛以及对全世界人民的斗争的背叛。我们谴责苏联修正主义者鼓吹的“联合行动”，因为他们企图用此欺骗人民和掩盖现代修正主义者的叛徒真面目。
    我们认为一切真正的马列主义者在支援越南人民斗争和世界人民斗争的时候，应该高举两面大旗，即反对美帝国主义的大旗和反对现代修正主义者的大旗。
    作为在华的外国工作人员，我们支持中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民的正确立场。我们已准备好在任何情况下，在我们认为必要的时刻，对声援越南人民的抗美救国斗争，同中国人民一起采取必要的行动。
    作为拉丁美洲和西班牙的革命者，我们保证和我们人民一起，对越南人民的英勇斗争给予一切我们力所能及的援助。
    在这光荣的日子，我们向越南人民表示最热情的支持。我们确信，胜利一定属于你们和我们。我们牢记毛主席的教导：“我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命风暴，定将给整个的旧世界以决定性的摧毁性的打击。越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，就是一个有力的证明。欧洲、北美和大洋洲的无产阶级和劳动人民，正处在新的觉醒之中。美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫已经准备好了自己的掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。”
    越南人民的抗美救国的英勇斗争万岁！
    我们反对各种形式的“和谈”以及和现代修正主义者的一切“联合行动”！
    我们采取一切更加有效的措施支持越南人民！
    拉丁美洲和西班牙人民的斗争和人民战争万岁！
    正在进行反美斗争的越南南方民族解放阵线万岁！
    打倒以苏共领导集团为首的现代修正主义！
    打倒世界人民的共同敌人美帝国主义！
    越南人民伟大和尊敬的领袖胡志明主席万岁！
    马克思列宁主义万岁！
    伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！
