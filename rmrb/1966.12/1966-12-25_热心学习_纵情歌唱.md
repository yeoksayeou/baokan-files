Currently, in various places in Bamako, the capital of the West African country of Mali, one often hears Malian people singing joyfully in their native language, Bambara: "Golon bu lai na (The East is Red), Kala gu bao (The sun rises)..."

The Malian people, with their deep love for the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, have long learned to sing "The East is Red" in Chinese. Recently, after a Malian friend translated the lyrics of "The East is Red" into the Malian national language, Bambara, more Malian people have been able to sing "The East is Red."

Many Malian friends who have visited China, upon returning to Bamako, would sing "The East is Red" or "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" at the airport to express their admiration for Chairman Mao.

Not long ago, at the exhibition of photographs from the Dazhai Production Brigade of the Dazhai People's Commune in China, held in Bamako, a group of Malian children listened intently to the broadcast of "The East is Red," mouthing the words along. After hearing it once, they asked for it to be played again. Soon, many of the children began to sing in Chinese: "The East is Red, the sun rises, China has given birth to Mao Zedong..."

A female student who went to see the exhibition sang "The East is Red" to the Chinese staff as soon as she entered the door. She said that her sister had learned it in Guinea and taught it to her entire family upon returning home. She also said that her family now often sings this song.

A group of students from the Kulikor Agricultural Technical School traveled sixty kilometers by truck to see the exhibition. Along the way, they encountered a heavy rain and were soaked. However, some students, upon entering the door, first asked the Chinese staff to teach them "The East is Red." When the Chinese staff agreed to their request, they immediately gathered around him and sang along, phrase by phrase.

On the first day of trial operation at the Dugabugu Sugar Factory, which was built with Chinese aid, all the Malian workers and local residents sang and danced. A Malian worker sang "The East is Red" in Chinese.

At the completion ceremony of the Malian Jioliba Cigarette Factory, which was also built with Chinese aid, a Malian friend, after delivering a speech praising Sino-Malian friendship, walked over to the Chinese experts and sang "The East is Red" together with them, shouting "Long live Mao Zedong!"

A Malian friend who had visited China said, "We African revolutionaries love Chinese revolutionary songs very much, such as 'The East is Red'..."

    热心学习　纵情歌唱
    目前，在西非马里共和国首都巴马科的各种场所，常可以听到马里人用民族语言邦巴拉语纵情歌唱：“戈龙不来那（东方红），喀来估包（太阳升）……”
    马里人民怀着对世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席的热爱，许多人早就学会用中文唱《东方红》。最近由于一位马里朋友把《东方红》的歌词译成了马里的民族语言邦巴拉语之后，就使马里会唱《东方红》的人更加普遍起来。
    许多访问过中国的马里朋友，一回到巴马科，就在机场上当众高唱《东方红》或者《大海航行靠舵手》，来表达他们敬仰毛主席的感情。
    不久前在巴马科举办的中国大寨人民公社大寨生产大队图片展览会上，一群马里少年儿童听到播送《东方红》的歌声时，就凝神贯注地听着，嘴里跟着学，听了一遍又要求再放一遍。很快，许多少年儿童就开始用中国话唱：“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……”
    有一个女学生去参观这个展览会，一进门，就高唱《东方红》给中国的工作人员听。她说：这是她的姐姐在几内亚学会的，回家后教会了她的全家。她还说，她们全家现在经常唱这支歌曲。
    库利科罗农业技术中学的一批学生，乘坐着卡车跑了六十公里去看这个展览会。他们路上遇到暴雨，全身都淋湿了。但是有些学生，一进门首先做的一件事，就是要求中国工作人员教他们唱《东方红》。当中国工作人员答应了他们的要求时，他们立刻围着他一句一句地跟着唱起来。
    在中国援助建设的杜加布古糖厂今年五月进行试榨的第一天，全厂马里职工和当地居民载歌载舞，一位马里工人用中国话高唱了《东方红》。
    在中国援助建设的马里吉奥利巴卷烟厂落成典礼上，一位马里朋友在发表讲话热烈赞扬中马友谊之后，又走到中国专家同志们身边，一起放声高唱《东方红》，并且高呼“毛泽东万岁！”
    一位访问过中国的马里朋友说，我们非洲的革命者就非常喜爱中国的革命歌曲，像《东方红》等。         ·新华社记者·（附图片）
