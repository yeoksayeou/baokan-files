The Laotian People's Liberation Army soldiers love Chairman Mao. They say, "Only by fighting according to Chairman Mao's thoughts can all humanity achieve complete liberation."

Recently, the officers and soldiers of a communications company of the Laotian People's Liberation Army watched the documentary film "Chairman Mao and the Million-strong Cultural Revolution Army" at the residence of the Chinese Economic and Cultural Mission to Laos. The officers and soldiers of this company said with great enthusiasm that watching this film was like seeing Chairman Mao in person, and they felt extremely excited. The soldiers who received a Chairman Mao badge jumped for joy. They said that seeing the Chairman Mao badge on their chests was like having Chairman Mao by their side at all times, filling them with courage and fearlessness.

A company commander of the communications company shared his thoughts, saying, "Chairman Mao's line is absolutely correct. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought also shines upon the Laotian people. The Laotian revolution must develop according to Chairman Mao's theories and thoughts. With the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, the Laotian revolution will advance further. Only by fighting according to Chairman Mao's teachings and thoughts can all humanity achieve complete liberation. As long as we act according to Mao Zedong Thought, we can defeat any enemy in the world."

The company commander also said, "The soldiers love reading Chairman Mao's books. After reading Chairman Mao's works, they have a clear understanding of the correct line and see their bright future."

A soldier from the communications company enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao as the "second Lenin." He said, "Chairman Mao is the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman of the world's people. All the people of the world love Chairman Mao and love reading Chairman Mao's books." He also enthusiastically praised the Chinese Cultural Revolution, saying, "The Chinese Cultural Revolution is a great encouragement to the people of all countries who are struggling for liberation, especially to us Laotian people."

Before the film screening, the soldiers of the communications company eagerly requested Mao Zedong's works from the Chinese mission members. During the film, they erupted in applause whenever they saw Chairman Mao on the screen. After the film, a soldier excitedly shook hands with a member of the Chinese mission and said, "I wish the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, eternal health and longevity!"

With boundless respect and joy, the Laotian People's Liberation Army soldiers receive Mao Zedong's works at an anti-aircraft artillery position and immediately start reading.

    老挝人民解放军某部通讯连的干部和战士最近在中国驻老挝经济文化代表团驻地看了《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》这部纪录影片。这个连的干部和战士满怀热情地说，他们看了这个影片，就像亲眼见到毛主席一样，感到无比兴奋。那些得到一枚毛主席像章的战士们高兴得跳了起来。他们说，看到自己胸前的毛主席像章，就像毛主席时刻在他们身边，使他们充满了勇气，什么都不怕了。
    一位通讯连的连长谈到他的感想时说：“毛主席的路线非常正确。毛泽东思想的光辉也照耀着我们老挝人民。我们老挝的革命也要按照毛主席的理论和思想去发展。有了光辉的毛泽东思想，老挝革命将进一步向前发展。”他说：“只有按照毛主席的教导和思想去斗争，才能使全人类获得彻底解放。只要按照毛泽东思想去做，世界上的任何敌人都可以打败。”
    这位连长还说：“战士们非常喜欢读毛主席的书。读了毛主席著作以后，明确了正确的路线，看清了自己的光明前途。”
