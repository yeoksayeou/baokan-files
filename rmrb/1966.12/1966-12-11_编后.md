Afterword

The speeches by several members of the Dajiaqu Brigade are worth reading carefully.

Since the members of the brigade have studied the works of Chairman Mao, especially the "Three Articles," their spiritual outlook is undergoing rapid changes. Those who were once indifferent to collective affairs, the "good-for-nothings," have become people who care about everything after studying the "Three Articles." Those who were once "in the barn but thinking about their private plots," who had skills but couldn't fatten the livestock, have now put the collective in their hearts, and even the cows that no one wanted to feed have been fattened. Those who used to want to resign when criticized have now corrected their shortcomings and done their work well after studying the "Three Articles."

This change is not an ordinary, simple change; it indicates that people's thoughts are undergoing a revolution to eliminate private interests and establish public interests. From the perspective of one person, one event, this change may not be noticeable. However, if today changes, tomorrow changes, and everyone changes, new people with communist ideals will grow in this process of change.

Chairman Mao said: The serious question is the education of the peasants. Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: We must infuse the thoughts of Mao Zedong into the peasants. We must always educate the members on the thoughts of Mao Zedong. Once they grasp the thoughts of Mao Zedong, the spiritual outlook of the members will undergo tremendous changes. They can control the sky, and the sky will bow; they can control the earth, and the earth will increase production. They can create any miracle.

    田家渠大队社员的几篇发言，值得大家好好读一读。
    社员同志们学习了毛主席著作，特别是学习了“老三篇”以后，精神面貌正在迅速地发生变化。本来是对集体事情漠不关心的“老好人”，学了“老三篇”，变成了关心集体的“啥都管”。本来是“身在饲养室，心在自留地”，有技术却喂不壮牲畜的人，学了“老三篇”，心里装了集体，没人肯喂的瘦牛也能喂肥。本来是听到别人批评就想“交印”不干的人，学了“老三篇”，就坚决改正缺点，做好工作。
    这种变化不是个普通的简单的变化，它表明人们的思想正经历着一场破私立公的革命。从一人、一事来看，这种变化也许并不引人注目。然而，今天变，明天变，不断地变，你也变，我也变，大家都变，具有共产主义思想的新人就会在这种变化中成长起来。
    毛主席说：严重的问题是教育农民。林彪同志指出：必须把毛泽东思想灌输到农民中去。我们要时时刻刻对社员进行毛泽东思想的教育。掌握了毛泽东思想，社员的精神面貌就会发生巨大变化。他们管天，天低头；管地，地增产，什么奇迹都可以创造出来。
