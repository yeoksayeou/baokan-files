Japanese friends warmly welcome the Chinese women's delegation. According to Xinhua News Agency's report on the 10th: Nagoya, China Women's Visiting Japan Delegation arrived in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture on the 9th and was warmly welcomed by local women's organizations and friends from various circles in Japan.

That afternoon, the "Aichi Prefecture Welcome Chinese Women's Association" held a banquet to welcome the Chinese Women's Visiting Japan Delegation. The representative of the Aichi Prefecture branch of the Japanese Women's Congress, Fujita Kenjo, delivered a welcome speech at the banquet. She said that the China Economic and Trade Exhibition held in Nagoya was a great success, which further strengthened the friendship and unity between the peoples of China and Japan. She wished the Red Guards in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution continued success.

The leader of the Chinese Women's Visiting Japan Delegation, Yang Yunyu, spoke at the banquet. She said that the reactionaries of the United States and Japan, and the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union along with their various new and old followers, are scheming to sabotage the friendly unity between the peoples of China and Japan. This does not indicate their strength but rather their weakness, showing that they are most afraid of the development of friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

The vice-chairman of the Aichi Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), Ito Nagamitsu, also spoke at the banquet. He pointed out that strengthening the unity between the peoples of China and Japan is a contribution to the defense of peace in Asia. Our women's delegation arrived in Tokyo on the 7th.

    日本朋友热烈欢迎我妇女代表团
    据新华社十日讯　名古屋消息：中国妇女访日代表团九日到达爱知县名古屋市，受到了当地妇女团体和日本各界朋友的热烈欢迎。
    当天中午，“爱知县欢迎中国妇女会”举行宴会，欢迎中国妇女访日代表团。日本妇女会议爱知县本部代表饭田绢绪在宴会上致欢迎词。她说，在名古屋举行的中国经济贸易展览会获得了极大成功，它使日中两国人民的友好团结进一步加强了。她祝中国无产阶级文化大革命中的红卫兵继续取得胜利。
    中国妇女访日代表团团长杨蕴玉在宴会上讲话时说，美日反动派和苏联现代修正主义者及其形形色色的新旧追随者，阴谋破坏中日两国人民的友好团结，这并不说明他们强大，而是说明他们虚弱，说明他们最怕中日两国人民友好的发展。
    日中友好协会（正统）总部爱知县分会副会长伊藤长光也在宴会上讲了话。他指出，巩固日中两国人民的团结是对保卫亚洲和平的贡献。我妇女代表团是七日到达东京的。
