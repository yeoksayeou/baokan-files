**Editor's Note:** "After studying the 'Three Articles,' people change, land changes, and mountains and rivers change." This is a phrase widely circulated in rural areas. The situation in Hongqing Production Brigade of Taicang County, Jiangsu, is exactly like this.

Our broad masses of peasants have followed the Party and Chairman Mao in revolution for decades. They have deep class feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao, listen most to Chairman Mao's words, and love to read Chairman Mao's books. Their proletarian consciousness is constantly improving. The immense socialist enthusiasm within them is being greatly unleashed. However, it must also be noted that the private ownership ideology formed over thousands of years still has a deep influence on many people's minds. To thoroughly eliminate the private ownership ideology from people's minds and cultivate the broad masses of peasants into communist new people, the most powerful weapon is the great Mao Zedong Thought; it is Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains."

The experience of Hongqing Brigade proves: As long as the "Three Articles" are truly taken as a motto to study, to study every day, to use every day, to study repeatedly, and to use repeatedly, and to make the basic viewpoints of the "Three Articles" known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the peasants, it will definitely bring about profound changes in the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of peasants and bring about earth-shaking changes in the rural landscape.

Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path forward for hundreds of millions of peasants. Let us further expand and deepen the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the countryside, and turn every people's commune and every production brigade into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought.

**The Growth of Communist New People in the Countryside**

**The Great Changes in Hongqing Brigade of Taicang County After Studying the "Three Articles"**

Chairman Mao said: "The serious problem is educating the peasants." He also said: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." Equipping the peasants with Mao Zedong Thought and guiding them to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, to carry out a revolution in their souls, is the fundamental purpose of organizing the peasants to study Chairman Mao's works, and it is the necessary path for the peasants to achieve ideological transformation. Over the past year, our practice in Hongqing Brigade has proven that the "Three Articles" are powerful ideological weapons for breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness and for transforming worldviews. Our brigade's study of Chairman Mao's works has focused on the "Three Articles," starting with the "Three Articles." Now, the images of Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, and the foolish old man, and Chairman Mao's sayings about "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, "selflessly serving others," and "resolving to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory" are known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Everyone says: "After studying the 'Three Articles,' our spiritual outlook has greatly changed. Learning from Zhang Side, selfishness is not allowed; learning from Norman Bethune, we do not compete for work points; learning from the foolish old man, we charge forward when facing difficulties." The basic viewpoints of the "Three Articles" have become the common code of conduct and direction of effort for the masses. After studying the "Three Articles," the eyes of the masses and cadres have become clearer, their feet more stable, their minds clearer, their vision broader, their thoughts more noble, and their hearts more open. The selfish psychology of peasants, which has been passed down for thousands of years, is being replaced by the communist ideology of selflessness and completely and thoroughly serving the people. Mao Zedong Thought has educated the commune members to understand how to treat revolution, work, difficulties, and life and death. The broad masses are being liberated from the "self." People's spiritual outlook is changing, relationships between people are changing, the social landscape of the countryside is changing, and new-type communist peasants are rapidly growing.

After the commune members of Hongqing Brigade studied Chairman Mao's works, especially the "Three Articles," the following changes occurred:

After studying the "Three Articles," they understood the principles of being a person, discarded selfishness, and replaced it with red-heartedness, completely and thoroughly serving the people. Breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness is the core of guiding peasants to transform their worldviews. After studying the "Three Articles," they understood the principles of farming for the revolution. In the past, it was "standing at the doorstep, seeing the private plot, farming for survival," but now it is "standing at the doorstep, seeing Tiananmen, looking towards the whole world, farming for the revolution." Young commune member Cao Peiying used to think, "Eating has parents, production has the brigade leader, national affairs have the Party Central Committee, and I just eat, work, and play." She studied the "Three Articles" and worked to the same standard in five aspects: collective work and individual work are the same, more work points and fewer work points are the same, being praised and not being praised are the same, whether the cadre is present or not is the same, and whether the work is good or not is the same. Last year, she taught at a primary school and had the highest income among all women in the brigade. This year, the brigade selected her to be the accountant, with a work point supplement less than that of a primary school teacher, and the work was heavier. She had internal struggles. She repeatedly studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," convinced herself, and also convinced her family. Now she is famous in the entire brigade as a "red accountant" and a "red calculator."

With the "self" in people's minds reduced, collective matters are taken more seriously. Everyone says: "No matter how small a collective matter is, it is a big matter; no matter how big a personal matter is, it is a small matter." Now, caring for the collective and loving collective matters are everywhere.

After studying the "Three Articles," good and bad people are distinguished, and revolutionary vigilance has greatly increased. When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, we immediately organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's sayings such as "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." The broad masses' ability to identify and fight against ghosts and snakes has improved, and they further understand that "we cannot only focus on the eight hundred and one thousand, ignoring the struggle against peaceful evolution," "we cannot only manage cotton and rice, ignoring poisonous weeds," "if the country changes color, even if one mu of land produces one thousand jin or ten thousand jin, it is of no use." Learning activist Gu Atao said: "The enemy sharpens his sword, and we also sharpen our swords. If the enemy sharpens one sword, we sharpen two swords, first sharpening the sword in our minds. I have two sons of the right age, if the country needs one, one goes; if it needs two, both go. Whenever the country needs, we go."

After studying the "Three Articles," communist spirit is greatly unleashed. Chairman Mao's instructions that "all members of the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other" have become the principles for commune members to handle mutual relationships. In late September, a nearby brigade had a fire that burned down six households. Our Seventh Brigade commune members not only all went to put out the fire but also anonymously sent more than ten pieces of clothing, sixty jin of rice, ten jin of flour, and ten jin of wheat bran. The Eighth Brigade found out that the Seventh Brigade had sent items, and the commune members immediately discussed it. Everyone said: "Chairman Mao teaches us: We all come from the five lakes and four seas, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together. If one person has difficulties, everyone should help." They also sent more than twenty pieces of clothing and eight yuan.

Each brigade also greatly unleashed the spirit of unity and love in production, solving a number of long-standing problems. The Third and Tenth Brigades had long been in dispute over water resources. After studying the "Three Articles," everyone unleashed the spirit of "selflessly serving others," and the Tenth Brigade voluntarily provided five mu of rapeseed seedlings, one hundred jin of peppermint roots, and two and a half jin of Tianlanzi to help the Third Brigade solve difficulties. The Third Brigade saw that a canal of the Tenth Brigade was leaking and another canal had poor water flow, and they voluntarily gave up five fen of land and provided free labor to help the Tenth Brigade repair two canals.

After studying the "Three Articles," they are not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of hardships, and everyone strives to be a new foolish old man. Chairman Mao's teachings about "resolving to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory" have become a powerful driving force for everyone to overcome difficulties and move forward. Commune members armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of hardships, dare to struggle, and dare to win. This year's summer harvest and summer planting had strict quality requirements: planting rice required "dry plowing, sun-drying the ridges, applying fertilizer on top, irrigating and plowing again, and reasonable dense planting," and planting cotton also had new requirements. At that time, we were a bit worried, but the masses unleashed the fearless spirit of not being afraid of fatigue, continuous fighting, and daring to take on heavy burdens, and they completed the tasks according to the requirements. The season was even a week earlier than last year. During the busy season, they also leveled fifty-five mu of land and filled in and expanded four mu of cultivated land. Especially to achieve high yields, under the high temperature of over forty degrees Celsius outdoors, the commune members crawled into the cotton fields to apply fertilizer and prune, sweating all over, but everyone was full of enthusiasm, singing and laughing, encouraging each other. Everyone said: "Difficulties are like stones, resolve is like a hammer, the hammer hits the stone, and difficulties bow their heads," "As long as Mao Zedong Thought arms the mind, even in the hottest weather, it does not feel hot; even in the greatest difficulties, it does not feel difficult. As long as Mao Zedong Thought arms the mind, we can change the sky and the earth and overcome everything."

After studying the "Three Articles," ideological struggles are greatly unleashed, self-criticism is not afraid of pain, and criticizing others is not afraid of difficulties. Chairman Mao's instructions about "for the people's interests, persist in what is right, and correct what is wrong," and opposing "not saying it to the face but talking behind the back; not saying it in meetings but talking after meetings," "not being concerned with what does not concern oneself, hanging high; knowing it is wrong, saying less is better" have become the principles of everyone's life. Carrying out criticism and self-criticism has gradually become a habit of everyone's life, making the entire brigade a united and fighting collective.

The brigade implemented the Dazhai-style scoring method, universally studied the above sayings, advocated criticism and self-criticism, and evaluated the style, unity, and enthusiasm of each brigade. Now, whoever has selfishness, everyone can criticize, and one can also criticize oneself according to Chairman Mao's sayings. In this way, many contradictions are easily resolved. Some who were previously called "troublesome households" and "untouchables" are now, under the education of Mao Zedong Thought, able to strictly demand of themselves, love the collective, and act for the public good. The contrast between before and after is like a different person.

After studying the "Three Articles," social customs have greatly changed, breaking with the old and establishing the new, and building a new socialist countryside. More and more people are taking "being a noble person, a pure person, a person with morality, a person who has broken away from low-level interests, and a person who benefits the people" as their goal, changing customs, and changing all living habits. Family relationships, including those between parents and children, husbands and wives, brothers, mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, and sisters-in-law, are changing. Every family has organized a study group for Chairman Mao's works, with mutual teaching and help. New-type family relationships are growing. Especially after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the commune members have smashed the Kitchen God's shrine, fortune-telling, ancestral halls, talismans, and flower banners that have poisoned people's minds for thousands of years. Not inviting guests for weddings, funerals, and celebrations has become a habit, and feudal superstitions have disappeared. The new social customs of advocating communist morality, science, and hygiene are being established.

After studying the "Three Articles," the cadres' ideological transformation is tightly grasped, and revolutionary will is more firm. The most prominent manifestation is that most cadres have resolved the problem of "being a cadre is a loss" in their minds, their spiritual state is good, and their work enthusiasm is high. Political squad leader Li Shusong of the Fourth Brigade used to only think about his own wealth, believing that being a cadre is a loss, and his work was not enthusiastic. After studying Chairman Mao's works, especially the "Three Articles," his thoughts have changed greatly. He said: "Comrade Norman Bethune was a foreigner, already over fifty years old, and still came across the ocean to help China fight the Japanese devils, sacrificing his life. I am a Chinese, and I am not happy to be a cadre and do revolution. Thinking about it, I really feel sorry for the Party and the revolutionary martyrs, which is completely wrong." From then on, he used the standard of "selflessly serving others" to demand of himself, always thinking of the masses, and working very seriously.

In summary, the more the "Three Articles" are studied, the more the cadres and masses love Chairman Mao, and the more self-aware they are in studying Chairman Mao's works. Everyone says: "Chairman Mao's works are the red sun, shining wherever they go," "Fish need water, children need mothers, commune members need Mao Zedong Thought," "Chairman Mao's book is written for us poor and lower-middle peasants, if we don't read Chairman Mao's book, whose book do we read? If we don't listen to Chairman Mao's words, whose words do we listen to?" Ten thousand words cannot express the deep love of the cadres and masses for Chairman Mao. Working a lifetime of revolution, studying a lifetime of Chairman Mao's works, and transforming a lifetime of thoughts have become the common wish of everyone. All the commune members of our entire brigade enthusiastically responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call to "take the 'Three Articles' as a motto to study. Every level must study. After studying, one must use it, and carry out ideological transformation." Everyone expressed their determination: "'The Three Articles' we will study until old age, use until old age, study a lifetime, use a lifetime, this generation studies, the next generation will also study, and it will be passed down from generation to generation."

专栏：

    编者按：“学了‘老三篇’，人变、地变、山河变。”这是农村中普遍传颂的一句话。江苏太仓县洪泾生产大队的情况正是这样。
      我国广大农民，跟着党和毛主席闹了几十年革命。他们对党和毛主席有着深厚的阶级感情，最听毛主席的话，最爱读毛主席的书，无产阶级觉悟一天天提高。他们当中蕴藏着的极大的社会主义积极性，正在大大发扬。但是，也应该看到，几千年来形成的私有观念，在许多人的头脑里，影响还是很深的。要彻底破除人们头脑中的私有观念，把广大农民培养成共产主义新人，最强大的武器就是伟大的毛泽东思想；就是毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等光辉著作。
      洪泾大队的经验证明：只要真正把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，天天学，天天用，反复学，反复用，让“老三篇”的基本观点，在农民中家喻户晓，深入人心，就一定能够使广大农民的精神面貌发生深刻的变化，使农村面貌发生天翻地覆的变化。
      毛泽东思想照亮了亿万农民前进的道路。让我们把农村的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动更广泛、更深入地开展起来，把每个人民公社、每个生产大队都办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    农村的共产主义新人在成长
    太仓县洪泾大队大学“老三篇”以来的巨大变化
    毛主席说：“严重的问题是教育农民。”又说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。用毛泽东思想武装农民，引导农民破私立公，在灵魂深处闹革命，这是组织农民学习毛主席著作的根本目的，是农民实现思想革命化的必由之路。一年多来，我们洪泾大队的实践证明，“老三篇”是破私立公、改造世界观的强大思想武器。我们大队学习毛主席著作，就是着重学习了
  “老三篇”，是以“老三篇”起家的。现在，张思德、白求恩、老愚公这三个形象，和毛主席关于“完全”
  “彻底”为人民服务、“毫不利己专门利人”、“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”这些语录，已经家喻户晓，深入人心。大家说：“学了‘老三篇’，精神面貌大改变。学习张思德，自私自利要不得；学习白求恩，不要争工分；学习老愚公，碰到困难向前冲。”“老三篇”中的几个基本观点，成了群众共同的行动准则和努力方向。学了“老三篇”，群众和干部的眼睛亮了，脚跟稳了，脑子清了，目光远了，思想高尚了，胸襟开阔了。几千年遗留下来的农民小私有者的自私心理，正在被大公无私、完全彻底为人民服务的共产主义思想所代替。毛泽东思想教育了社员懂得怎样对待革命，对待工作，对待困难，对待生死。广大群众正在从“我”字中解放出来。人的精神面貌在变，人与人的关系在变，农村的社会面貌在变，新型的共产主义的农民正在迅速成长。
    洪泾大队社员学习了毛主席著作，特别是学习了“老三篇”，具体有以下一些变化：
    学了“老三篇”，懂得了做人的道理，丢掉私心换红心，“完全”“彻底”为人民。破私立公，这是引导农民改造世界观的核心。学了“老三篇”，懂得了为革命种田的道理。过去是“站在家门口，看到自留地，种田为活命”，现在是“站在家门口，看到天安门，眼望全世界，种田为革命”。青年社员曹培英过去认为“吃饭有爷娘，生产有队长，国家大事有党中央，自己吃吃做做白相相”。她学了“老三篇”，干活做到五个一样：集体干活和单独干活一样，工分多和工分少一样，受表扬和不受表扬一样，干部在场和不在场一样，活好做和不好做一样。去年她当耕读小学教师，全年收入是全队妇女中最多的一个。今年队里选她当会计，补贴工分比耕读教师少，工作又重，思想有斗争。她反复学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》，说服了自己，也说服了家庭，现在她是全大队出名的“红管家”、“红算盘”。
    群众头脑里的“私”字少了，集体的事情就看得重了。大家说：“集体的事再小是大事，个人的事再大是小事。”现在，关心集体、热爱集体的事到处出现。
    学了“老三篇”，好人坏人分得清，大大提高了革命警惕性。无产阶级文化大革命开始，我们随即组织大家学习了毛主席的“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人”等语录。广大群众对牛鬼蛇神的识别能力和斗争意志提高了，进一步认识到“我们不能只抓八百一千，不抓反对和平演变”，“不能只管棉花水稻，不管香花毒草”，“国家变了颜色，一亩田收一千斤、一万斤也没有用”。学习积极分子顾阿桃说：“敌人磨刀，我们也要磨刀，敌人磨一把刀，我们磨两把刀，先磨思想上的刀。我有两个适龄儿子，国家要一个就去一个，要两个去两个，啥辰光要啥辰光去。”
    学了“老三篇”，共产主义精神大发扬。毛主席关于“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的指示，已成为社员处理相互关系的原则。九月下旬，附近一个大队失火，烧了六户人家。我们七队社员不但都去救了火，还不留名地送去了十多件衣裳，六十多斤大米，十多斤面粉，十多斤麦片。八队发现七队送了，社员马上讨论，大家说：“毛主席教导我们：我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。一人有困难，要大家帮助。”也送去二十多件衣服和八元钱。
    各队在生产上，也大大发扬了团结友爱的精神，解决了一批老大难问题。三队和十队过去一直闹水利纠纷。学了“老三篇”，大家发扬“毫不利己专门利人”的精神，十队主动拿出五亩油菜秧、一百斤薄荷根、二斤半天兰子，帮助三队解决困难。三队看到十队的一条渠道漏水，一条渠道流水不畅，主动让出五分土地，还出了义务工，帮助十队修了两条渠道。
    学了“老三篇”，不怕难，不怕苦，人人争做新愚公。毛主席关于“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，成了大家战胜困难，不断前进的强大动力。用毛泽东思想武装起来的社员，不怕难，不怕苦，敢于斗争，敢于胜利。今年夏收夏种的质量要求很严，种水稻要求“旱犁晒垡，挑上面肥，灌水再犁，合理密植”，种棉花也有新的要求。当时，我们有些担心，结果群众发扬了不怕疲劳、连续作战、敢于挑重担的大无畏精神，按要求办到了，季节还比去年提前一个星期。在大忙中，还平整了五十五亩土地，填浜扩大了四亩耕地。特别是为了夺取高产，在室外四十度以上的高温之下，社员钻到棉田里施肥、整枝，汗流得浑身湿淋淋，但是大家干劲很足，一面劳动，一面学毛主席语录，歌声笑声不绝，互相鼓励。大家说：“困难像石头，决心像榔头，榔头敲石头，困难就低头”，“只要有了毛泽东思想武装头脑，再热的天气不觉得热，再大的困难不觉得难。只要有了毛泽东思想武装头脑，我们就能改天换地，战胜一切。”
    学了“老三篇”，思想斗争大开展，批评自己不怕痛，批评别人不怕难。毛主席关于“为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的”，和反对“当面不说，背后乱说；开会不说，会后乱说”，“事不关己，高高挂起；明知不对，少说为佳”的指示，成了大家生活的准则。开展批评与自我批评逐渐成为大家的生活习惯，使整个大队成为团结战斗的集体。
    大队推行大寨式评分法，普遍学习了上述语录，提倡批评与自我批评，使各队评出了风格，评出了团结，评出了干劲。现在谁有私心，大家都能进行批评，自己也会对照毛主席语录，进行自我批评。这样，许多矛盾就迎刃而解。一些过去称为“难缠户”、“惹不起”的人，在毛泽东思想的教育下，现在也能严格要求自己，热爱集体，处处为公。前后对比，就像换了一个人。
    学了“老三篇”，社会风气大改变，破四旧，立四新，建设社会主义新农村。越来越多的人正在以做“一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人”为目标，改变风俗，改变一切生活习惯。家庭关系，包括父子、夫妻、兄弟、婆媳、妯娌关系，正在起变化。家家组织了毛主席著作的学习小组，包教包学，相互帮助。新型的家庭关系正在成长。特别是无产阶级文化大革命开展之后，社员把几千年来毒害人的思想的灶君殿、发禄、家堂、符纸、花幡等，通通捣乱砸烂。婚丧喜庆不请客已成习惯，封建迷信活动已经绝迹。讲共产主义道德，讲科学，讲卫生等新的社会风气正在树立。
    学了“老三篇”，干部思想改造抓得紧，革命意志更坚定。突出的表现是，大多数干部从思想上解决了“当干部吃亏”的问题，精神状态好，工作干劲足。四队政治队长李树松，过去只想个人发家，认为当干部“吃亏”，工作不起劲。学习了毛主席著作，特别是学了“老三篇”，他的思想起了很大变化。他说：“白求恩同志是一个外国人，已经五十多岁了，还隔洋过海的来帮助中国打日本鬼子，献出了自己生命。我是中国人，还不高兴当干部、干革命，想想实在对不起党，对不起革命先烈，是完全错误的。”从此，他用“毫不利己专门利人”的标准要求自己，处处为群众着想，工作很认真。
    总之，越学“老三篇”，干部群众就更加热爱毛主席，学习毛主席著作更加自觉。大家说：“毛主席著作是红太阳，照到那里那里亮”，“鱼靠水，囡靠娘，社员靠毛泽东思想”，“毛主席的书就是为我们贫下中农写的，毛主席的书不读，读啥人的书？毛主席的话不听，听啥人的话？”千言万语，也说不尽群众干部对毛主席无比热爱的感情。干一辈子革命，学一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子思想，成了大家的共同心愿。我们全大队社员十分热烈响应林彪同志关于“要把‘老三篇’作为座右铭来学。哪一级都要学。学了就要用，搞好思想革命化”的号召。大家表示决心说：“‘老三篇’我们要学到老，用到老，学一辈子，用一辈子，这一代人学，下一代人还要学，世世代代传下去。”
