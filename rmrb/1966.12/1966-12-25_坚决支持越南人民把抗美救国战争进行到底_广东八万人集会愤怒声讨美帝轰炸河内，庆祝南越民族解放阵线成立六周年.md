Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Red Guards and revolutionary masses from various sectors, totaling 800,000 people, held a grand rally this afternoon at Yuexiu Mountain Stadium to strongly denounce the heinous crime of American aggressors bombing Hanoi and to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

Today, Yuexiu Mountain was filled with a fighting atmosphere of aiding Vietnam and resisting America, and despising all enemies. The Red Guards, People's Liberation Army soldiers, militia, workers, peasants, and cadres from various departments formed a magnificent procession in the morning, carrying portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and countless banners and red flags, surging to Yuexiu Mountain from all directions. The mountain was a sea of red flags, and the slogans and revolutionary songs of aiding Vietnam and resisting America echoed through the sky. After arriving at the venue, people repeatedly opened their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read the quotations from our great leader Chairman Mao on opposing imperialism and all reactionaries.

Ngan Seng, a member of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, and Mayor of Guangzhou City, Nguyen Minh Phuong, Deputy Head of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, Du Van Minh, Consul General of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Guangzhou, and representatives of the Red Guards, PLA soldiers stationed in Guangzhou, workers, and peasants, spoke at the rally in succession.

Ngan Seng strongly denounced the heinous crime of American imperialism's mad bombing of Hanoi, praised the military and people of North Vietnam for continuously giving the American planes a head-on blow, and praised the people of South Vietnam for continuously punishing the enemy. He said that the Vietnamese people will definitely realize the great call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, fight to the end, and achieve complete victory in the anti-American national salvation struggle.

Ngan Seng sternly condemned the modern revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union for actively serving the American imperialist's plot of "bombing to force negotiations," playing the role of the number one accomplice in the American war of aggression against Vietnam. He said that all those who truly support the struggle of the Vietnamese people and oppose American imperialist aggression must draw a clear line with the Soviet revisionist leadership.

Ngan Seng also pointed out in his speech that the recent incident of the Portuguese authorities in Macao brutally massacring patriotic compatriots in Macao was also orchestrated with the vigorous support of the American imperialists. The people of Guangdong Province are closely watching the developments in Macao. Ngan Seng concluded by saying that under the personal initiation and leadership of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, the people of our country are carrying out an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This cultural revolution is the most fundamental preparation for the people of China to support the Vietnamese people and oppose the American imperialist's expansion of the war of aggression. He said that we will definitely carry out the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying out the anti-American national salvation war to the end. The people of Guangdong Province, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, like the 700 million people of the whole country, are ready at any time to fight alongside the Vietnamese people and thoroughly defeat American imperialism!

Nguyen Minh Phuong introduced in his speech the great achievements made by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in various aspects since its birth six years ago, and the brilliant victories of the South Vietnamese people in the anti-American national salvation struggle. He said that the recent continuous dispatch of American aggressor planes to bomb the urban areas of Hanoi and the Chinese Embassy, as well as other embassy areas, is a very serious new "escalation" of the war. The people of South Vietnam are burning with hatred and have already and are continuously striking the enemy fiercely on all battlefields, determined to make the American aggressors pay the blood debt owed to the people of Hanoi.

Nguyen Minh Phuong pointed out that the new heinous crimes of American imperialism have exposed the deceitful nature of its "peace" fraud. We, the people of South Vietnam, will not be deceived and will never return to a life of slavery. The solution to the Vietnamese problem can only be based on the five-point statement of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and there is no other way.

Nguyen Minh Phuong said that Chairman Mao Zedong's statement supporting the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle is a great encouragement to the people of South Vietnam. The people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam have always regarded the victories achieved by the brotherly Chinese people as their own victories.

He also said that the people of South Vietnam are extremely indignant about the incident of American imperialists sending planes to bomb Chinese fishing boats, killing and injuring many people. The people of South Vietnam strongly condemn the savage suppression of local Chinese residents by the Portuguese authorities in Macao and fully support the four demands proposed in the statement of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee.

Leaders from various sectors of the Central-South Bureau of the Communist Party, Guangzhou Military Region, Guangdong Province, and Guangzhou City, such as Chen Yu, and some foreign friends in Guangzhou, also attended the rally.

    坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底
    广东八万人集会愤怒声讨美帝轰炸河内，庆祝南越民族解放阵线成立六周年
    据新华社广州二十四日电　广东省、广州市红卫兵和各界革命群众八万多人，今天下午在越秀山体育场举行声势浩大的集会，最强烈地声讨美国强盗轰炸河内的滔天罪行，热烈庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立六周年。
    今天的越秀山，充满了援越抗美、藐视一切敌人的战斗气氛。参加集会的红卫兵小将、人民解放军指战员、民兵、工人、农民和机关干部，在上午就结成雄伟的行列，高举着伟大领袖毛主席的画像和胡志明主席的画像，举着数不清的标语牌和红旗，从四面八方涌到越秀山来。山上红旗如海，援越抗美的口号声和高唱革命歌曲的声音，响彻云霄。人们到会场后，一遍又一遍翻开红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，朗读我们伟大领袖毛主席有关反对帝国主义和一切反动派的语录。
    中共广东省委常委、广东省副省长、广州市市长曾生，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代理团长阮明芳，越南民主共和国驻广州总领事杜文敏，以及红卫兵、驻广州部队指战员、工人和农民的代表，先后在大会上讲了话。
    曾生在讲话中强烈地声讨美帝国主义疯狂轰炸河内的滔天罪行，赞扬越南北方军民不断给美帝飞机以迎头痛击，赞扬越南南方人民不断给敌人以新的惩罚。他说，越南人民一定会实现胡志明主席的伟大号召，战斗到底，直到抗美救国斗争取得彻底胜利。
    曾生严正地谴责苏联现代修正主义领导集团积极为美帝“以炸迫和”的阴谋效劳，在美帝侵越战争中扮演了头号帮凶的角色。他说，一切真正支援越南人民斗争、反对美帝国主义侵略的人们，必须同苏联修正主义领导集团划清界限。
    曾生还在讲话中指出，最近澳门葡萄牙当局血腥屠杀澳门爱国同胞的事件，也是在美帝竭力支持下炮制出来的。广东省人民正密切地注视着澳门局势的发展。曾生最后说，我国人民正在我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的亲自发动和领导下，进行一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。这场文化大革命是中国人民支援越南人民、反对美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的最根本的战备。他说，我们一定坚决执行林彪同志的指示，坚决支持兄弟的越南人民把抗美救国的战争进行到底。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广东省人民和全国七亿人民一样，随时准备和越南人民一道，彻底打败美帝国主义！
    阮明芳在讲话中介绍了越南南方民族解放阵线诞生六年来在各方面所取得的伟大成就，介绍了越南南方人民抗美救国斗争的辉煌胜利。他说，美帝国主义最近连续派出强盗飞机轰炸河内市区和中国使馆以及其他使馆区，这是一次极其严重的新的战争“升级”。越南南方人民心中燃烧起仇恨烈火，已经和正在各个战场上猛烈地连续打击敌人，决心要美国强盗偿还欠下河内人民的血债。
    阮明芳指出，美帝国主义新的滔天罪行暴露了它的“和平骗局”的狡诈性质。我们越南南方人民决不上当，决不会重新过受奴役的生活。越南问题的解决，只能根据越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明和越南民主共和国政府的四点主张，而没有其它别的任何途径。
    阮明芳说，毛泽东主席支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的声明，对于越南南方人民是巨大的鼓舞。越南南方人民和越南南方民族解放阵线一贯把兄弟的中国人民所取得的胜利看作自己的胜利。
    他还说，越南南方人民对美帝国主义派遣飞机轰炸中国人民的渔船，打死打伤多人的事件感到无比愤慨。越南南方人民强烈谴责澳门葡萄牙当局野蛮镇压当地中国居民的暴行，并完全支持广东省人委外事处长声明中提出的四项要求。
    中共中央中南局、广州部队和广东省、广州市各方面的负责人陈郁等，和在广州的一些外国朋友们，都参加了大会。
