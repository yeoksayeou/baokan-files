	China has consistently assisted in the transit of aid to Vietnam according to plan
	Vietnam News Agency Authorized Statement Refutes Western Fabrications

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 13th — On the 10th, the Vietnam News Agency issued a statement refuting the fabrications of Western news agencies regarding the transit of Soviet aid to Vietnam through China. These fabrications claimed that China created difficulties and delayed the transit of goods, among other malicious rumors.

	The statement said that regarding the transit of Soviet aid to Vietnam through China, Western news agencies had repeatedly spread false information claiming that China created difficulties, delayed the transit, and altered the markings on the goods. Recently, the Associated Press even fabricated the claim that China had completely stopped the transit of Soviet military aid to Vietnam.

	The Vietnam News Agency, therefore, issued an authorized statement: "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly affirmed that China has consistently assisted in the transit of aid from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to Vietnam according to plan."

	The statement further said, "The aforementioned reports from Western news agencies are completely groundless and are driven by extremely despicable schemes of provocation."

    中国一贯按计划尽力帮助  援助越南的物资转运过境
    越南通讯社受权声明驳斥西方造谣
    新华社河内十三日电　越南通讯社十日在一项声明中，驳斥西方通讯社造谣所谓苏联援越物资在中国转运过境时，中国制造困难和拖延时间等无耻谰言。
    声明说，关于苏联援越物资在中国转运过境一事，西方通讯社曾多次散布消息说什么，中国制造困难、拖延时间和改变货物标志等等。最近，合众国际社又造谣说，中国全部停止转运苏联援越军事物资过境。
    越南通讯社为此受权发表声明：“越南民主共和国政府曾多次肯定指出，中国一贯按计划尽力帮助苏联和其他社会主义国家援助越南的物资转运过境。”
    声明说，“西方通讯社的上述消息，是完全没有根据的，是怀有极为卑鄙的挑拨阴谋的。”
