	Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!
	With the ocean as an inkstone and the sky as paper, we write new poems,
	Thousands and thousands of poems, each one praising Chairman Mao.
	Great teacher Chairman Mao, we are most loyal to you;
	For truth, we fight without fear, even facing fire and water!
	Great leader Chairman Mao, we love you most dearly;
	With the four volumes of your teachings by our side, we are invincible!
	Great commander Chairman Mao, we believe in you most firmly;
	As pioneers of the three great revolutions, we hold high the red flag.
	Great helmsman Chairman Mao, we admire you most profoundly;
	Following the golden path you have charted, we sail through waves without losing our way.
	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, we will forever follow you;
	With our hearts for our country and eyes on the world, we will surely make the red flag fly everywhere!
	With the ocean as an inkstone and the sky as paper, we write new poems;
	Ten thousand lines of poetry, one heart: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!
