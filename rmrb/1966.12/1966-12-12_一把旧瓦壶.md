In a farmer's home in the Yimeng Mountain area, an elderly woman took out an old clay teapot from a chest and poured us water to drink. She said, "More than twenty years ago, I used this teapot to give the Eighth Route Army hot soup. Today, I use it to serve you 'little Eighth Route Army'..."

On November 9th, we set out from Yiyuan and continued our march through the old revolutionary base area of Shandong—the Yimeng Mountain area.

At noon, we crossed a hill and saw an elderly woman and two little girls coming down the slope. Each of them was carrying a sack on their backs, which looked quite heavy. The three of them seemed to be struggling with the weight. Several of our classmates, ignoring the pain from the blisters on their feet, rushed over and asked the elderly woman where she was going. She said she was going home, and her home was twelve li away. We then offered to carry the sacks for them, but they refused. After much persuasion, we finally managed to take the sacks from them.

As we walked, we chatted with the elderly woman. When she learned that we were part of a long-distance expedition to Beijing, she was overjoyed and repeatedly said, "You're going to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, that's wonderful, that's wonderful! You must shout 'Long live Chairman Mao' for me!"

We delivered the sacks to her home and were about to leave. The elderly woman and the two girls insisted on not letting us go and urged us to rest for a while. We had no choice but to sit down and rest.

Seeing that we had sat down, the elderly woman eagerly opened a red lacquered wooden chest and took out an old clay teapot. She poured the tea from the teapot into the clay teapot and then poured it out for us to drink. We were puzzled as to why the elderly woman had specifically taken out this old clay teapot to serve us water. The elderly woman seemed to have noticed our confusion and, holding the teapot, smiled and said, "Children, this teapot was used more than twenty years ago to give the Eighth Route Army tea and soup. Don't mind its appearance; it played a part in the anti-Japanese war. You may not like its look, but it has its history. Today, you are going to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, you are my honored guests, so I took out this teapot to serve you water."

After hearing this, we suddenly understood and felt a warmth in our hearts. Drinking the tea poured from this teapot, we truly felt it was sweet to the heart, as if we had never tasted such delicious tea before.

As we prepared to leave, the elderly woman accompanied us for more than a li. Before parting, she said, "You are Chairman Mao's Red Guards, you are the good descendants of the poor and lower-middle peasants, you are the good younger siblings of Lei Feng and Wang Jie. When you get to Beijing, don't forget to give my regards to Chairman Mao and wish him a long life!"

As we walked on the road, we felt as if we had gained boundless strength. The road wound up the mountain, making it difficult to walk, but we did not feel tired at all. Each of us silently thought: Along the path we walk, in the surrounding mountains, throughout the entire Yimeng Mountain area, our revolutionary forebears had shed so much blood and paid so many precious lives to overthrow the old world and create a new one. Every mountain and river here records the glorious deeds of the martyrs. Thinking of this, we spontaneously recited Chairman Mao's words: "Countless martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests ahead of us. Let us hold high their banner and march forward on the path of their blood!"

    一把旧瓦壶
    在沂蒙山区一个农民家里，一位老大娘从箱子里找出一把旧瓦壶，给我们倒水喝。她说，在二十多年前，她用这把壶给八路军送过汤水，今天又用它来招待我们“小八路”……
    十一月九日，我们从沂源出发，继续在山东的老革命根据地——沂蒙山区行进。
    中午时分，我们越过一个山头，看见山坡上走过来一个老大娘和两个小女孩。她们背上各背着一条口袋，看样子都相当重，三个人背得都很吃力。我们队里的几个同学不顾脚上水泡的疼痛，一齐跑过去，问老大娘去哪里？她说要回家去，她的家离这儿有十二里路。我们就提出要替她们背一阵，她们不肯。说了半天，好容易才把口袋接了过来。
    我们一边走，一边和老大娘闲谈。当老大娘知道我们是上北京去的远征队，高兴得什么似的，连连说：“你们上北京看毛主席，那太好啦，太好啦！你们要替大娘多喊几声毛主席万岁！”
    我们把大娘送到家，放下口袋，就准备上路。大娘和两个小姑娘怎么也不放。执意不过，只好坐下来休息一会儿。
    大娘看到我们坐下来了，兴冲冲地打开一只红漆木箱，从里面拿出一把瓦茶壶，把茶瓶里的茶水倒进瓦壶里，再倒出来让我们喝。我们感到奇怪，为什么大娘要特地找出这么一把旧瓦壶来盛水给我们喝呢？大娘大概已经看出了我们脸上的迷惑神情，就捧着瓦壶笑着对我们说：“孩子，这把瓦壶，俺在二十多年前给八路军送过茶，送过汤，你们别看它颜色不好看，抗日打鬼子还有它一份功劳呢。俺看你们就像当年的小八路。今儿你们去北京看望咱毛主席，是俺的贵客，俺就找出这把瓦壶请你们喝水。”
    经老大娘这么一说，我们恍然大悟，不觉心里热呼呼的。喝着从这壶里倒出来的茶，我们真是喝在嘴里，甜在心头，仿佛从来没有喝过这样甘美的茶水。
    我们要走了，老大娘又送了我们一里多路，临别时对我们说：“你们是毛主席的红卫兵，你们是俺贫下中农的好后代，是雷锋、王杰的好弟妹。你们到了北京，别忘了代大娘向毛主席问好，祝他老人家长寿！”
    我们走上公路，身上仿佛增添了无穷的力量。公路盘山而上，很不好走，但是我们一点也不觉得累。我们每个人都在默默地想：在我们走的路上，在我们周围的丛山中，在整个沂蒙山区，我们的革命前辈为了推翻旧世界，创造新世界，曾经流了多少血，付出了多少宝贵的生命呵。这儿的一山一水，都记载着先烈们战斗的光辉业绩。想到这里，我们不由得齐声朗诵起毛主席语录：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”
