The editorial board of the *People's Liberation Army Daily* writes: Chairman Mao's three brilliant works, "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," are the fundamental required courses for every revolutionary to establish a proletarian worldview. They are powerful ideological weapons for eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, and for transforming people's souls. Over the past twenty years, the great thoughts contained in these three brilliant works have played an immeasurably great role in changing the spiritual face of the people, nurturing new communists, and advancing the people's revolutionary cause.

Comrade Lin Biao has instructed us, "The 'Three Articles' should be studied not only by soldiers but also by cadres. The 'Three Articles' are the easiest to read, but it is not easy to truly practice them. We should study the 'Three Articles' as our guiding principles. Every level should study them. Once studied, we should put them into practice and promote ideological revolutionization. We must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, and in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must diligently study and apply the 'Three Articles.' Using the great thoughts of the 'Three Articles' as our weapons, we must carry out a revolution in our souls. We must thoroughly eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness, completely eliminate all the selfish ideas of the exploiting classes, and allow Mao Zedong Thought to occupy every ideological position. We must carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and temper ourselves into noble, pure, moral, and disinterested people who are beneficial to the people.

To help comrades in the units study the "Three Articles," we have compiled new teaching materials, which will be published in installments for reference.

"Serve the People" is an article written by Chairman Mao on September 8, 1944, at a memorial meeting for Comrade Zhang Zide.

Comrade Zhang Zide was from Lixian County, Sichuan Province. Born in 1915, his family was poor, with four members. His father and elder brother both died from overwork for the landlord, and his mother passed away seven months after giving birth to him. Later, he was raised by his aunt Liu Guangyou. Liu Guangyou's family was very poor, and at the age of 12 or 13, Zhang Zide was forced to work for the landlord. In August 1933, he joined the Red Army and the Communist Youth League, and later joined the Communist Party of China. He participated in the Long March and was wounded. Before his martyrdom, he served as a soldier in the Central Guard Regiment of the Communist Party of China. Comrade Zhang Zide was always loyal and diligent, fearless of hardships and difficulties, and exemplified the excellent qualities of a Communist Party member and revolutionary soldier. On September 5, 1944, while burning charcoal in the mountains of Anse County, Shaanxi Province, he unfortunately died in a cave-in. To commemorate Comrade Zhang Zide, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a memorial meeting. Chairman Mao personally wrote the epitaph "In honor of Comrade Zhang Zide who sacrificed his life for the people's interests" and delivered the famous speech "Serve the People" at the meeting.

"Serve the People" is a great work of communist education with high ideological content and strong persuasive power. It is the fundamental required course for revolutionaries to transform their thoughts and establish a proletarian worldview. This work is concise and easy to understand, yet its content is rich and profound. Over the past twenty years, the great thoughts in this work have played and continue to play an immeasurably great role in raising the class consciousness of a wide range of cadres and soldiers, and in changing the spiritual face of the people. Advanced individuals such as Lei Feng, Ou Yanghai, Wang Jie, Jiao Yulu, Mai Xiande, Liu Yingjun, and Cai Yongxiang, and advanced units such as the 6th Company, the 9th Company, and the 32111 Drilling Team, have all been nurtured by the thoughts of serving the people in this work. The broad masses of soldiers and officers in our army, and hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, have drawn boundless spiritual strength from this work, which has been transformed into a great material force for changing the world. This has greatly strengthened the construction of our army and greatly promoted the socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country.

The thought of completely and thoroughly serving the people in this great work is the core of the communist worldview. Revolutionary soldiers must repeatedly study "Serve the People" and constantly use the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" mentioned in this work to examine and urge themselves to transform into new communists and into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause who serve the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly.

The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fundamentally speaking, is a great revolution to eliminate the selfish ideas of all exploiting classes that have existed for thousands of years and to establish socialist public-mindedness. It is a great revolution to transform people's souls. The thought of completely and thoroughly serving the people in Chairman Mao's work is a powerful ideological weapon for eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, and for transforming people's souls. We must seriously study this great work, use its thoughts as our weapons, thoroughly eliminate the selfish ideas of the exploiting classes, achieve ideological revolutionization, and resolutely complete the great historical task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In studying this great work, we should focus on understanding the following points:

1. Eliminate Selfishness and Establish Public-Mindedness, Completely and Thoroughly Serve the People

Chairman Mao said: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary forces. Our forces are completely for the liberation of the people and work thoroughly for the people's interests."

Our Party fights for the complete liberation of the proletariat. The proletariat not only liberates itself but also liberates all of humanity. If the proletariat cannot liberate all of humanity, it cannot ultimately liberate itself. The people are the driving force behind world history, the subject of the revolution, and the masters of society. Therefore, serving the people's interests is the starting point of all our Party's work. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses; everything should start from the people's interests, not from personal or small group interests; the unity of being responsible to the people and being responsible to the Party's leading organs; these are our starting points." ("On the Coalition Government")

Our army is a military force under the absolute leadership of the Party, executing revolutionary political tasks. It is an army of the people, for the people, and from the people. Chairman Mao points out: "Stand firmly with the Chinese people, serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly, this is the sole purpose of this army." ("On the Coalition Government")

Completely and thoroughly serving the people is the revolutionary essence of our Party and our army, and it is also a quality that every revolutionary must possess. To completely and thoroughly serve the people, the most fundamental issue is to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness, to eliminate selfish thoughts and establish public-minded thoughts.

Selfishness means always thinking of oneself, only caring for oneself, seeking fame, seeking profit, seeking power, seeking position, seeking to stand out, forgetting the whole, forgetting society, forgetting the 700 million Chinese people, and forgetting the billions of people around the world. Public-mindedness means not seeking fame or profit, not fearing hardship or death, being selfless, benefiting others, dedicating oneself to the revolution, dedicating oneself to the people, and serving the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly. Selfishness and public-mindedness are two fundamentally opposed worldviews between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. In a battle between two armies, there must be a winner and a loser. It is either one overcoming the other or the other overcoming one. The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fundamentally speaking, is a fierce struggle between these two worldviews, a thought revolution to break with the old and establish the new, to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness. In this great revolution that touches people's souls, every revolutionary comrade must be able to withstand the test, stand at the forefront of the struggle, consciously carry out a revolution in the depths of their souls, and resolutely engage in the struggle to eliminate bourgeois thoughts and establish proletarian thoughts, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to completely occupy the ideological positions in their minds, and thoroughly eliminate the bourgeois selfish ideas.

To eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness, we must correctly handle the relationship between revolutionary interests and personal interests. This is a dividing line that can distinguish whether a comrade serves the people completely and thoroughly or half-heartedly. To completely and thoroughly serve the people, we must prioritize the interests of the revolution, the people, and human liberation above everything else. Personal interests must unconditionally serve the interests of the revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members, regardless of time and place, should not place personal interests first, but should subordinate personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people." ("The Position of the Communist Party of China in the National War") Some comrades are picky about their work, willing to do it only if the pay is high, unwilling if it is low; willing to do it if it aligns with their personal ideals, unwilling if it does not; willing to do it if it brings fame, unwilling if it does not. In short, they place personal interests first, which is incompatible with the thought of completely and thoroughly serving the people. The experiences of many people show that thinking only of oneself makes one's heart heavy, while thinking of the revolution makes one's heart light.

Chairman Mao said: "All our working cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is to serve the people. What bad things do we have that we are reluctant to give up?" ("The Tasks for 1945") Revolutionary work only has different divisions, not high and low, noble and humble. Every industry is an indispensable part of the revolutionary cause. As long as we approach it with the correct attitude, we can make contributions beneficial to the people, and it is a promising and prosperous job. The Party assigns what to do, regardless of the position's height, the burden's weight, or the conditions' goodness, as long as it is the Party's need and the people's need, we should actively and happily do it. This is what a good comrade does. Zhang Zide served in the army for over a decade and was still happy to be a soldier, treating charcoal burning as an important task assigned by the Party. He was truly a loyal servant of the people. Lei Feng said: "The entire task of a Communist Party member is to serve the people wholeheartedly," he loved and excelled in every job he did, shining wherever he was placed. Wang Jie said: "What is an ideal? Revolution is the ideal; what is the future? The revolutionary cause is the future; what is happiness? Serving the people is happiness." We should all take them as examples, completely abandon selfishness, and do every job wholeheartedly and diligently, becoming a revolutionary screw, shining wherever the Party places us, never rusting.

2. Live for the People, Die for the People

Chairman Mao said: "People are bound to die, but the meaning of death is different. An ancient Chinese writer named Sima Qian said: 'People are bound to die, but some deaths are heavier than Mount Tai, and some are lighter than a feather.' Dying for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai; dying for the fascists, for those who exploit and oppress the people, is lighter than a feather." He also said: "The Chinese people are suffering, and we have the responsibility to save them. We must strive and fight. Fighting will inevitably lead to sacrifices, and deaths are common occurrences. But we think of the people's interests, of the suffering of the majority of the people. We die for the people, and it is a worthy death. However, we should try our best to avoid unnecessary sacrifices." Chairman Mao here points out the fundamental attitude of revolutionaries towards life and death.

Our Party is a revolutionary party, and our army is a revolutionary army. To revolutionize, we must pay a price and have sacrifices. As Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese people are not afraid of death, so what are they afraid of?" ("Farewell, Stuart") Not fearing death, nothing in the world can intimidate us, and we will annihilate all the ghosts and demons in the world! Modern revisionists, from fearing death and preserving their lives to abandoning the revolution, have completely betrayed the proletarian revolutionary cause. Whether a person is a true revolutionary or a false one, truly serving the people or falsely serving the people, can be tested in many ways. When the people's interests require it, can one bravely sacrifice their life? This is the strictest, most distinct, and most reliable test among all tests.

Our countless revolutionary martyrs, for the people's interests, faced death bravely and set a brilliant example for us. Their deaths saved more lives and brought liberation to the broad masses of the people. Their deaths are heavier than Mount Tai, and they will forever live in the hearts of the people. Liu Hulan, for the cause of the people's liberation, bravely faced hardships and ultimately died a heroic death in front of the cruel enemy. Chairman Mao's inscription for her is: "Great in life, glorious in death!" This inscription is also a call for each of us to take Liu Hulan as an example, to live for the people and die for the people. This is the best motto for every revolutionary to correctly face life and death.

Selflessness leads to fearlessness. Those who serve the people wholeheartedly are the bravest. Countless revolutionary martyrs became fearless and unafraid of death because they dedicated themselves to the revolution, to the people, and to the public good. Ou Yanghai said: "If it is necessary to sacrifice for the ideal of communism, each of us should and can do it—without changing color or skipping a heartbeat." Wang Jie said: "For the suffering and oppressed people, even if I die, I am willing, even if I face a mountain of knives or a sea of fire, I will never waver." Cai Yongxiang said: "Like Comrade Norman Bethune, we should dedicate our entire lives and all our efforts to the cause of human liberation and communism." It can be seen that their fearless spirit of sacrifice is not accidental but is the result of constantly arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and establishing a proletarian worldview. A person who lives only for themselves and fears losing out in everything, how can they sacrifice their heads and shed their blood for the people? Such a person, when facing difficulties in the revolutionary struggle, will feel completely in the dark, will become pessimistic, waver, and even betray the revolution. Only those who arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly believe that victory belongs to the people, and serve the people wholeheartedly, can see achievements and light in times of difficulty, can have unlimited courage to fight against difficulties, and can bravely sacrifice their lives when the people's interests require it, daring to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire. In short, only those who live for the people can die for the people. Only those whose thoughts are firm in peacetime can withstand the test in critical moments.

We advocate a brave and fearless spirit, but this does not mean we should not cherish life. On the contrary, to fight for the people's interests, we should pay attention to safety and health and avoid unnecessary sacrifices. This is completely different from being afraid of death and cowardly.

3. For the People's Interests, Persist in What is Right, and Correct What is Wrong

Chairman Mao said: "Because we serve the people, if we have shortcomings, we are not afraid of others pointing them out. No matter who it is, as long as you point out our shortcomings, we will correct them. If your method benefits the people, we will follow it.... As long as we persist in what is right for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, our forces will definitely prosper." Chairman Mao here points out the fundamental attitude of proletarian revolutionary soldiers towards criticism and self-criticism, which is to persist in what is right and correct what is wrong for the people's interests.

Having serious self-criticism is one of the distinctive features that distinguish our Party from other parties. Seriously carrying out criticism and self-criticism is a fine tradition of our Party. With such serious criticism and self-criticism, our Party can continuously overcome shortcomings and errors that do not align with the people's interests, resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, and achieve genuine unity and consolidation. We can gain the support and trust of the broad masses and advance our revolutionary cause.

Our Communist Party members can seriously carry out criticism and self-criticism because we are based on the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly. Chairman Mao, as early as twenty years ago, earnestly taught us: "Chinese Communists, who take the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people as their starting point, believe that their cause is completely just, are willing to sacrifice everything personal, and are ready at any time to give their lives for our cause. Is there any thought, viewpoint, opinion, or method that does not meet the people's needs and is reluctant to give up? Do we welcome any political dust or political microbes to sully our clean faces and erode our healthy bodies?" ("On the Coalition Government") We should implement Chairman Mao's important instructions, seriously carry out criticism and self-criticism, always think of the revolutionary cause, think of the Party and the people's interests, and put personal gains and losses aside. In this way, we will have open hearts and clear minds, truly persisting in what is right and correcting what is wrong for the people's interests.

If a person always puts "I" first and is anxious about gains and losses, they cannot correctly recognize their shortcomings and errors, correctly face various criticisms and suggestions. They are not afraid of being criticized for their shortcomings but are afraid of this and that, afraid of losing "face," afraid of losing "authority," afraid of taking responsibility, afraid of losing vested interests, etc. The result is that shortcomings are not overcome, errors are not corrected, and it is harmful to the Party and the people, harmful to oneself. They do not treat people equally; as long as they have shortcomings, "no matter who it is, as long as you point out our shortcomings, we will correct them," but they act according to the person: willing to accept criticism from superiors but feeling embarrassed by criticism from subordinates; willing to accept criticism from like-minded people but unwilling to accept criticism from those with differing opinions; willing to accept criticism from advanced comrades but easily resentful of criticism from backward comrades or those who have made mistakes, etc. The result is that channels of communication are blocked, and they become more and more detached from the masses. They do not adopt the attitude of "as long as you are right, we will correct it" towards others' opinions but act out of personal grudges, using excuses like "attitude" being bad, minor issues not aligning with facts, etc., to deny others' correct opinions; towards others' not entirely correct opinions, they fly into a rage rather than "having faults to correct and none to encourage," the result is that disagreements are magnified, and comrade unity is affected. They do not adopt the attitude of "if your method benefits the people, we will follow it" towards initiatives from the masses but see themselves as "Zhuge Liang" and the masses as "Liu Bei," do not believe in the wisdom of the masses, and do not adopt the masses' good initiatives, the result is that the masses' enthusiasm is dampened, and work becomes cold and narrow. Therefore, to truly persist in what is right and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, we must be brave in self-revolution, overcome all personalistic selfish thoughts.

Comrade Lin Biao proposed that we should regard ourselves as a force for the revolution and at the same time regard ourselves as an object of the revolution. The revolution also needs to revolutionize itself. Without revolutionizing oneself, the revolution cannot be carried out well. We must follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, seriously carry out self-criticism, revolutionize ourselves in our souls, constantly and fiercely fight against "I," liberate ourselves from "I," establish the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly, and become a genuine Communist Party member, a selfless, truth-seeking, error-correcting proletarian revolutionary soldier.

4. To Achieve the Common Revolutionary Goal, Unite with Comrades and the People

Chairman Mao said: "We all come from the lakes and seas, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together. We must also walk this path with the majority of the people in the country." He also said: "Our cadres must care for every soldier, and all members of the revolutionary forces must care for, love, and help each other." Chairman Mao here raises a very important issue, which is the issue of revolutionary unity.

Our revolutionary forces must serve the people and complete the revolutionary tasks, so we must solve the problems of internal and external unity. Unity is strength. Only by uniting under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forming a strong fighting entity, can our revolutionary forces generate great strength, defeat the enemy, overcome difficulties, and achieve victory in the revolutionary and construction causes. Chairman Mao points out: "National unity, people's unity, and unity among the various nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees for the victory of our cause." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") We proletarian revolutionary soldiers must pay great attention to the great significance of revolutionary unity.

Our unity is unity under the common revolutionary goal, unity of like-minded people. In the current stage of our country, our revolutionary goal is to achieve socialism and prepare for the transition to communism. Therefore, all those who wish to take the socialist path, we must unite with them. Mao Zedong Thought is our guiding light for adhering to the socialist path and the fundamental guarantee for achieving our common revolutionary goal. Therefore, Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's line and policies formulated under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought are the common ideological foundation for our unity. All those who truly support Mao Zedong Thought and act according to Mao Zedong Thought should unite closely. To the handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought elements within the Party who take the capitalist road, rightist elements of the bourgeoisie, and counter-revolutionary revisionists, we must wage a resolute struggle against them.

Our revolutionary comrades come from the lakes and seas, and in terms of ideological level, experience, personality traits, living habits, etc., there are thousands of differences. Everyone may have different opinions and attitudes towards the same thing. In such a situation, how can we achieve mutual understanding and unity among comrades, and work together to do a good job? There are issues of method and attitude, but the most fundamental issue is still the issue of attitude. This is the issue of whether it is for personal interests or for the public good. Treating comrade relationships based on personal interests and feelings will definitely not achieve unity; only for the people's interests and the common revolutionary cause can one have deep class feelings for comrades, have a broad mind, and achieve unity.

With a broad mind and deep class feelings for comrades, cadres can truly care for every soldier. Good cadres like Wang Yuchang are like this. When soldiers are sick, he often eats and sleeps poorly; when soldiers have difficulties, he does everything possible to help solve them; when soldiers have shortcomings, he first examines his own responsibilities. He often says: "Caring for soldiers is caring for the revolution. For the revolution, I can give up everything." He risked his life five times to save soldiers' lives.

With a broad mind and deep class feelings for comrades, revolutionary comrades can promote class love and communist style, truly achieving serious responsibility on principle issues and goodwill on non-principle issues; always caring for others more than for oneself; enduring hardships first and enjoying later; leaving difficulties for oneself and convenience for others; learning from the advanced and helping the backward; facing dangers first and letting others take the credit. With such a noble collective spirit, our forces will be united like steel, invincible, and unstoppable.

To completely and thoroughly serve all the people of China and the world, our revolutionary comrades must strengthen unity in the revolutionary struggle and strive to unite with all those who can be united. We must unite with the overwhelming majority of the people in the country, jointly struggle, and thoroughly defeat all class enemies, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and achieve complete victory in the socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country. We must unite with the overwhelming majority of the people in the world, jointly struggle, and thoroughly defeat imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries, and strive for the great ideal of communism.

    学习《为人民服务》
    《解放军报》编者按：毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》三篇光辉著作，是每个革命者树立无产阶级世界观的最根本的必修课，是破私立公、改造人们灵魂的强大的思想武器。二十多年来，这三篇光辉著作的伟大思想，对于改变人民的精神面貌，哺育共产主义新人，推进人民革命事业，发生了不可估量的伟大作用。
    林彪同志指示我们，“老三篇”不但战士要学，干部也要学。“老三篇”最容易读，真正做到就不容易了。要把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学。哪一级都要学。学了就要用，搞好思想革命化。我们要坚决响应林彪同志的号召，在当前无产阶级文化大革命中，狠学狠用“老三篇”，以“老三篇”的伟大思想为武器，在灵魂深处闹革命。要大破“私”字，大立“公”字，把一切剥削阶级的为私的观念统统打掉，让毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把自己锻炼成为一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。
    为了帮助连队的同志们学好“老三篇”，我们重新编写了辅导材料，陆续发表，供学习参考。
      《为人民服务》这篇文章，是毛主席一九四四年
  九月八日在追悼张思德同志的大会上所作的讲演。
      张思德同志是四川仪陇县六合场人，生于一九一
  五年。他家是贫农，全家四口人，父亲和哥哥都是给
  地主干活累死的，母亲在生下他七个月以后也病故
  了。以后由他的叔母刘光友把他抚养成人。刘光友家
  里很穷，张思德十二、三岁就被迫给地主干活。他于
  一九三三年八月参加了红军，这一年加入了共产主义
  青年团，以后又加入了中国共产党。他参加了两万五千里长征，负过伤。牺牲前，他在中共中央警卫团当战士。张思德同志为党为人民一贯忠心耿耿，勤勤恳恳，不避艰险，不怕困难，表现了一个共产党员和革命战士的优良品质。一九四四年九月五日，他在陕北安塞县山中烧炭，不幸因炭窑崩塌而牺牲。为了悼念张思德同志，中共中央直属机关举行了追悼大会。毛主席亲笔写了“向为人民利益而牺牲的张思德同志致敬”的挽词，并在会上发表了《为人民服务》这篇著名的演说。
      《为人民服务》，这是一篇具有高度思想性和强烈说服力的共产主义教育的伟大著作，是革命人民改造思想，树立无产阶级世界观的最根本的必修课。这篇著作，短小通俗，内容极其丰富深刻。二十多年来，这篇著作的伟大思想，对于提高广大干部战士的阶级觉悟，对于改变人民群众的精神面貌，发生了并且继续发生着不可估量的伟大作用。雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、焦裕禄、麦贤得、刘英俊、蔡永祥等先进人物，好八连、硬六连、红九连和32111钻井队等先进单位，都受到了这篇著作的为人民服务思想的哺育。我军广大指战员和亿万革命群众，都从这篇著作中汲取了无穷的精神力量，并转化成为改造世界的巨大的物质力量，大大加强了我军的建设，大大推进了我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业。
    这篇伟大著作中的完全彻底为人民服务的思想，是共产主义世界观的核心。我们革命战士一定要反复学习《为人民服务》，经常用这篇著作中所说的“完全”、“彻底”的精神来检查自己，鞭策自己，把自己改造成为共产主义新人，成为全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    当前的无产阶级文化大革命，从根本上说，是破除几千年来一切剥削阶级为私的观念，建立社会主义为公的观念的大革命，是改造人的灵魂的大革命。毛主席这篇著作中的完全彻底为人民服务的思想，是破私立公，改造人们灵魂的强大的思想武器。我们一定要认真学习这篇伟大著作，以这篇著作的思想为武器，彻底破除剥削阶级为私的观念，实现思想革命化，坚决完成无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历史任务。
    学习这篇伟大著作，要着重领会以下几个问题：
  一、破私立公，完全
      彻底地为人民服务
    毛主席说：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”
    我们党是为无产阶级的彻底解放而奋斗的。无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。人民，是创造世界历史的动力，是革命的主体，是社会的主人。所以，为人民的利益服务，是我们党一切工作的出发点。毛主席教导我们：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发；向人民负责和向党的领导机关负责的一致性；这些就是我们的出发点。”（《论联合政府》）
    我们的军队，是在党的绝对领导下，执行革命的政治任务的武装集团，是来自人民，为了人民的人民军队。毛主席指出：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”（《论联合政府》）
    完全彻底地为人民服务，是我党我军的革命本质，也是每个革命者必须具备的品质。我们要做到完全彻底地为人民服务，最根本的问题是要破私立公，破为私的思想，立为公的思想。
    为私，就是处处想到自己，只顾自己，争名，争利，争权，争位，争出风头，忘了整体，忘了社会，忘了七亿中国人民，忘了几十亿世界人民。为公，就是不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，毫不利己，专门利人，一心为革命，一心为人民，全心全意地为中国人民和世界人民服务。为私、为公，这是资产阶级同无产阶级之间的两种根本对立的世界观。两军对战，必有胜负。不是这个克服那个，就是那个克服这个。当前的无产阶级文化大革命，从根本上说，就是这两种世界观的激烈斗争，就是破旧立新、破私立公的思想大革命。在这场触及人们灵魂的大革命中，我们每个革命同志要能经受住考验，要站到斗争的最前列，要自觉地在自己的灵魂深处闹革命，坚决进行灭资兴无、破私立公的斗争，让毛泽东思想在头脑里完全占领阵地，彻底破除资产阶级的为私的观念。
    破私立公，必须正确处理革命利益和个人利益的关系。这是一条界线，它可以辨别出一个同志为人民服务是完全彻底的，还是三心二意、半心半意的。我们要完全彻底地为人民服务，就要把革命的利益，人民的利益，人类解放的利益，看得高于一切。个人利益无条件地服从革命的利益。毛主席教导我们：“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益。”（《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》）有的同志对工作挑挑拣拣，待遇高的就愿意干，待遇低的就不愿意干；合个人理想的就愿意干，不合个人理想的就不愿意干；能出名的就愿意干，不能出名的就不愿意干。总之，是把个人利益摆到了第一位，这和完全彻底为人民服务的思想是格格不入的。很多人的经验都说明，一心想个人，心里就堵的慌，一心想革命，心里就敞亮。
    毛主席说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，我们有些什么不好的东西舍不得丢掉呢？”（《一九四五年的任务》）革命工作只有分工的不同，没有高低贵贱之分，各行各业都是革命事业不可缺少的一部分，只要我们以正确的态度去对待，都能做出有益于人民的贡献，都是有前途、有出息的工作。党叫干啥就干啥，不管职位高低，担子轻重，条件好坏，只要是党的需要，人民的需要，就积极愉快地去做，这才是好同志。张思德入伍十多年，仍然愉快地当个战士，把烧炭当作党的重要任务去完成，他不愧是人民的忠实勤务员。雷锋说：“共产党员的全部任务就是全心全意为人民服务”，他干一行爱一行，干一行专一行，放到哪里哪里亮。王杰说：“什么是理想，革命到底就是理想；什么是前途，革命事业就是前途；什么是幸福，为人民服务就是幸福。”我们每个同志都应当以他们为榜样，完全丢掉私心，干什么工作都一心一意，踏踏实实，做一个革命的螺丝钉，党把我们拧在哪里，就在哪里，永不生锈，闪闪发光。
  二、为人民而生，
      为人民而死
    毛主席说：“人总是要死的，但死的意义有不同。中国古时候有个文学家叫做司马迁的说过：‘人固有一死，或重于泰山，或轻于鸿毛。’为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”又说：“中国人民正在受难，我们有责任解救他们，我们要努力奋斗。要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。不过，我们应当尽量地减少那些不必要的牺牲。”毛主席在这里给我们指出了革命者对待生死问题的根本态度。
    我们党是革命的党，我们军队是革命的军队。要革命，就不能不付出代价，就不能没有牺牲。为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天。正如毛主席所说：“中国人死都不怕，还怕困难么？”（《别了，司徒雷登》）不怕死，世界上就没有任何东西可以吓倒我们，而我们却要把世界上的一切牛鬼蛇神通通消灭光！现代修正主义者，由怕死保命到取消革命，完全背叛了无产阶级革命事业。一个人是真革命还是假革命，是真为人民服务还是假为人民服务，要经过许许多多的考验。当人民利益需要的时候，能不能勇敢地献出自己的生命，是各种考验中最严格、最鲜明、最过硬的考验。
    我们无数革命先烈，为了人民的利益视死如归，给我们树立了光辉的榜样。他们的死，换取了更多人的生，换来了广大人民群众的翻身解放。他们死的意义比泰山还重，他们永远活在人民的心里。刘胡兰为了人民的解放事业，不避艰险，最后在凶恶的敌人面前壮烈牺牲。毛主席为她的题词是：“生的伟大，死的光荣！”这个题词也是号召我们每个同志，要以刘胡兰为榜样，为人民而生，为人民而死。这是我们每个革命者正确对待生死问题的最好的座右铭。
    无私，才能无畏。全心全意为人民服务的人，才能最勇敢。无数革命先烈所以能够成为大无畏的人，不怕死的人，正是因为他们一心为革命，一心为人民，一心为公。欧阳海说过：“如果需要为共产主义的理想而牺牲，我们每一个人都应该、也可以做到——脸不变色，心不跳。”王杰说过：“为了受苦受难的人民就是死了我也心甘情愿，就是上刀山入火海也永不变心。”蔡永祥说过：要“像白求恩同志那样，把自己的毕生精力和整个生命，为人类的解放事业共产主义全部献出。”可见，他们勇于献身的精神，并不是偶然的，正是在平时不断用毛泽东思想武装头脑，树立了无产阶级世界观。一个活着只为了自己，事事怕吃亏的人，怎么能够为人民抛头颅、洒热血呢？这种人，在革命斗争中遇到困难的时候，就会感到一团漆黑，就会悲观、动摇甚至叛变革命。只有用毛泽东思想武装头脑，坚信胜利必定属于人民，全心全意为人民服务的人，才能在困难的时候看到成绩，看到光明，才能有无限的勇气去同困难作斗争，才能在人民利益需要的时候，勇敢地献出自己的生命，刀山敢上，火海敢冲。总之，只有为人民而生的人，才能为人民而死。只有平时思想过得硬，在紧要关头才经得起考验。
    我们提倡勇敢、不怕牺牲的精神，决不是说不要去珍惜生命。相反，为了能为人民的利益而奋斗，我们应当注意安全和健康，尽量避免那些无谓的牺牲。这和怕死、不勇敢是截然不同的。
  三、为人民的利益坚持
      好的，为人民的利
      益改正错的
    毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。……只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来。”毛主席在这里指出了无产阶级革命战士对待批评和自我批评问题的根本态度，这就是为人民的利益坚持好的、改正错的。
    有无认真的自我批评，是我们党和其他政党互相区别的显著标志之一。认真地开展批评和自我批评，是我们党一贯的优良作风。有了这种认真的批评和自我批评，我们党就能够不断克服不符合人民利益的缺点错误，抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀，达到真正的团结和巩固。我们就能够得到广大群众的拥护和支持，使我们的革命事业不断前进。
    我们共产党人能够做到认真地开展批评和自我批评，是建立在全心全意为人民服务的思想基础上的。毛主席早在二十年前就语重心长地教导我们：“以中国最广大人民的最大利益为出发点的中国共产党人，相信自己的事业是完全合乎正义的，不惜牺牲自己个人的一切，随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业，难道还有什么不适合人民需要的思想、观点、意见、办法，舍不得丢掉的吗？难道我们还欢迎任何政治的灰尘、政治的微生物来玷污我们的清洁的面貌和侵蚀我们的健全的肌体吗？”（《论联合政府》）我们要执行毛主席这一重要指示，认真地开展批评和自我批评，就要时时刻刻想到革命的事业，想到党和人民的利益，把个人的一切得失置之度外。这样我们就会心胸开朗，头脑清醒，真正做到为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的。
    一个人如果总是“我”字当头，患得患失，他就不可能正确地认识自己的缺点和错误，正确地对待各种批评和建议。他不是有了缺点，“就不怕别人批评指出”，而是怕这怕那，怕丢“面子”，怕失“威信”，怕负责任，怕丧失既得利益，等等，其结果是缺点得不到克服，错误得不到改正，有害于党和人民，有害于自己。他不是平等待人，只要自己有缺点，就“不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行”，而是论人行事，有所“选择”：上级批评愿意接受，下级批评就感到难为情；情投意合的人批评愿意接受，和自己有意见分歧的人批评就不愿意接受；先进的同志批评愿意接受，后进的同志、犯过错误的同志批评就容易反感，等等，其结果是堵塞言路，越来越脱离群众。他对于别人的意见，不是采取“只要你说得对，我们就改正”的态度，而是闹个人意气，借口别人“态度”不好，枝节问题上不符合事实等，去否定别人的正确意见；对别人不够正确的意见，更是暴跳如雷，而不是“有则改之，无
  则加勉”，其结果是扩大意见分歧，影响同志团结。他对于来自群众的倡议，不是“你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办”，而是把自己当成“诸葛亮”，把群众当成“阿斗”，不相信群众的智慧，不采纳群众的好倡议，其结果是挫伤群众的积极性，使工作冷冷清清，路子越走越窄。因此，我们要真正做到为人民的
  利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，就要勇于自我革命，克服一切个人主义的私心杂念。
    林彪同志提出，我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好
  的。我们一定要遵照林彪同志的指示，以毛泽东思想为武器，认真地进行自我批评，在灵魂深处革自己的命，不断狠斗“我”字，把自己从“我”字中解放出来，树立一心为人民的思想，做一个完全的共产党员，做一个大公无私、坚持真理、修正错误的无产阶级革命战士。
  四、为了实现共同的革
      命目标，团结同志，
      团结人民
    毛主席说：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。我们还要和全国大多数人民走这一条路。”又说：“我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”毛主席在这里提出了一个极其重要的问题，这就是革命的团结问题。
    我们革命队伍要为人民服务，要完成革命的任务，就必须解决内部和外部的团结问题。团结就是力量。我们革命队伍内部，我们革命队伍和广大人民之间，只有在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下面团结起来，形成坚强的战斗整体，才能产生巨大的力量，战胜敌人，克服困难，取得革命和建设事业的胜利。毛主席指出：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”（《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》）我们无产阶级革命战士，必须十分重视革命团结的重大意义。
    我们的团结，是在共同革命目标下面的团结，是志同道合的团结。在我国现阶段，我们的革命目标是实现社会主义，并为过渡到共产主义准备条件。因此，一切愿意走社会主义道路的人们，我们都要同他们团结起来。毛泽东思想是我们坚持走社会主义道路的指路明灯，是我们实现共同革命目标的根本保证。因此，毛泽东思想和在毛泽东思想指导下制定的党的路线、政策，是我们团结的共同的思想基础。一切真正拥护毛泽东思想，照毛泽东思想办事的人，都应该紧密地团结起来。对于反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派、资产阶级右派分子和反革命修正主义分子，我们必须同他们作坚决的斗争。
    我们革命队伍的同志，来自五湖四海，在思想水平、经验阅历、个性特点、生活习惯等等方面，可以说有着千差万别。大家对同一件事情，就可能有各种不同的意见和态度。在这样情况下，怎样做到同志间互相谅解、互相团结，同心协力地去搞好工作呢？这里面有方法问题，有态度问题，但是最根本的还是态度问题。这就是为私还是为公的问题。以私人的利益和感情来对待同志关系，必然搞不好团结；只有为了人民的利益，为了共同的革命事业，才能对同志产生深厚的阶级感情，才能有宽大的胸怀，才能搞好团结。
    有了一心为公的宽大胸怀，有了对同志的深厚的阶级感情，干部才能很好地关心每个战士。爱兵的好干部王裕昌同志就是这样。战士有病了，他常常跟着吃不好，睡不好，病在战士身上，疼在他心上；战士有了困难，他千方百计地去帮助解决；战士有了缺点，他首先检查自己没有尽到的责任。他常说：“关心战士，就是关心革命，为了革命我可以豁出一切。”他五次冒着个人生命危险，抢救了战士的生命。
    有了一心为公的宽大胸怀，有了对同志的深厚的阶级感情，革命同志之间才能发扬阶级友爱和共产主义风格，真正做到在原则问题上严肃负责，在非原则问题上善于让步；处处关心别人，胜过关心自己；吃苦在前，享受在后；把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人；见先进就学，见后进就帮；见艰险就上，见荣誉就让。有了这种高尚的集体主义精神，我们的队伍就会团结得像钢铁一样，无坚不摧，无往而不胜。
    为了完全彻底地为全中国人民和全世界人民服务，我们革命队伍的同志，要在革命斗争中，加强团结，还要争取团结一切可以团结的人们。我们一定要同全国绝大多数人民团结起来，共同斗争，彻底战胜一切阶级敌人，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，使我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业取得彻底胜利。我们一定要同全世界绝大多数人民团结起来，共同斗争，彻底战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，为实现共产主义的伟大理想而奋斗。
