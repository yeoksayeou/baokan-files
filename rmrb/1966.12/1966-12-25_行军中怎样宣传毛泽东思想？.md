Dear Red Guards and young revolutionaries!

Thirty-seven years ago, Chairman Mao taught us in the Gutian Conference Resolution that "The Chinese Red Army is a revolutionary military force that carries out political tasks." He also said, "The Red Army is not just a force to fight battles; in addition to fighting to destroy the enemy's military strength, it must also undertake the important tasks of propagating among the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, and so on." During all the revolutionary wars, the Red Army, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the People's Liberation Army have always followed Chairman Mao's teachings. In addition to completing combat missions, they have also propagated among the masses, organized the masses, and armed the masses as a glorious political task.

After victory, the People's Liberation Army has inherited and carried forward this glorious tradition. While executing combat missions, they have widely propagated Mao Zedong Thought among the people. The entire army has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. It is not only a great school of Mao Zedong Thought but also a propaganda team and a sowing machine for Mao Zedong Thought. Every soldier understands that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire nation. Chairman Mao's words have the highest authority and the greatest power. The masses understand them as soon as they hear them and find them effective as soon as they use them. Once the masses grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they will generate the great power to transform society and nature. Therefore, at any time and in any place, the soldiers, with the highest enthusiasm and greatest passion, propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the people. They ensure that their hands do not leave Chairman Mao's books, their mouths do not leave Chairman Mao's words, their hearts do not leave Chairman Mao's thoughts, and their actions do not leave Chairman Mao's teachings. Wherever they go, they propagate Mao Zedong Thought. A certain detachment of the Chemical Defense Company of the People's Liberation Army, during a 3,000-mile march, did everything possible to propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the people. The entire company became an outstanding propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought. When the company party branch formulated the marching plan, it first formulated the plan to propagate Mao Zedong Thought; when arranging work, it first arranged the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought; when checking the work among the masses, it first checked the situation of propagating Mao Zedong Thought. They said, "You can forget about eating, you can forget about clothes, but you cannot forget about propagating Mao Zedong Thought. 'The wind can stop, the rain can stop, but propagating Mao Zedong Thought cannot stop.'" On the march, they did not miss any opportunity to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Whenever they passed through crowded places, they would perform cultural and entertainment programs and revolutionary songs that propagate Mao Zedong Thought. As soon as the troops entered a village, the soldiers would first write Chairman Mao's quotations on the blackboards. One day, the troops marched over 120 miles and arrived at the campsite at 11 PM. Four hours later, the troops had to continue marching. At this time, Deputy Political Instructor Mao Zhenhua, like always, carefully checked all the blackboard newspapers in the village. When he found that one blackboard was not finished, he and the soldiers lit lanterns and finished it together. In places where they camped for more than a day, the company's active members in studying Chairman Mao's works would actively propagate the experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the people. The comrades who marched at the front, every time they passed a large rock, a wall, a village entrance, or a big tree, would write or paste Chairman Mao's quotations. The medical personnel, after treating a villager once, would propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the patient. They did this and propagated Mao Zedong Thought to the people in 32 counties and over 300 villages along the way. They achieved the goal of spreading red seeds in every village and propagating every day, ensuring that the 3,000-mile journey was uninterrupted. The people said with gratitude, "The PLA has brought us the true scriptures of revolution, brought us Mao Zedong Thought."

How to effectively propagate Mao Zedong Thought during marching? Based on the experience of many units, it can be summarized as follows:

Propagating Mao Zedong Thought must be linked to reality and closely related to the center. This requires soldiers to first care about national affairs, understand the Party's policies and guidelines, and understand the central tasks of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire nation in each period. In this regard, some units have done very well. In March and April of this year, a severe earthquake occurred in the Xingtai area of Hebei Province. To help the people restore production and rebuild their homes, a certain detachment of the PLA organized a propaganda army of over 10,000 people for Mao Zedong Thought, under the unified leadership of the local Party committee. They divided into hundreds of teams, like the old Eighth Route Army, carrying backpacks, dry rations, Chairman Mao's works, and quotation boards, braving wind and rain, climbing mountains and crossing wilderness, rushing to every village and town in the Xingtai area. The cadres and soldiers helped the people restore production while studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with the poor and lower-middle peasants, solving problems together. This made the people in the disaster area see the light and boost their morale in difficult times. They showed the heroic spirit of "the house may collapse, but the will does not fall, the earth may shake, but the heart does not waver," and demonstrated the spirit of collectivism, self-reliance, and hard work, developing production and rebuilding their homes. The entire disaster area presented a new and vibrant scene of "people change, the earth changes." This detachment spent more than a month in the earthquake-stricken area, covering 19 counties and cities, 5,300 production brigades, and propagating the great Mao Zedong Thought to 3.9 million people. This is the most outstanding example of propagating Mao Zedong Thought by linking it with the central work of the time and place. Currently, the people of our country are carrying out an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, advancing along the path indicated by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works extensively, launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Under these circumstances, propagating Mao Zedong Thought among the people requires vigorously propagating the spirit of the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, which Chairman Mao personally presided over, and the "Sixteen Points" formulated under Chairman Mao's personal guidance. No matter where you go, you should study Chairman Mao's works with the people and exchange learning experiences, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

Propagating Mao Zedong Thought requires different approaches for different audiences and using various forms. In addition to studying Chairman Mao's works with the masses, some companies also use storytelling and introducing the deeds of heroes. When studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," they combine it with introducing the deeds of Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the old fool who moved mountains, vigorously propagating the new generation of communists nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought, such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, and Cai Yongxiang. Where conditions permit, they can also show slides, exhibit photographs, perform cultural and entertainment programs, and sing revolutionary songs.

Propagating Mao Zedong Thought requires consistency between words and deeds. Not only should one study Chairman Mao's works well, but also vigorously carry forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army of loving the people and serving the people, strictly adhere to the three main rules of discipline and eight points for attention. This action itself is the most powerful propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought.

Marching and spreading the red. Whenever the Fourth Company of a certain detachment of the Shenyang Military Region arrives at a village, the first thing they do after putting down their backpacks is to paste Chairman Mao's quotations, so that the people can see Chairman Mao's instructions everywhere.

### 行军中怎样宣传毛泽东思想？

    行军中怎样宣传毛泽东思想？
    亲爱的红卫兵战士们，亲爱的革命小将们！还在三十七年前，毛主席在古田会议决议中，就教导我们说：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。”又说：“红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众……等项重大的任务。”在历次革命战争中，红军、八路军、新四军和人民解放军始终遵循着毛主席这一教导，除了完成作战任务以外，还把宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，作为一项光荣的政治任务。
    胜利以后，人民解放军继承和发扬了过去的光荣传统，他们在执行战斗任务的同时，向人民群众广泛地传播了毛泽东思想。全军高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，既是毛泽东思想的大学校，又是毛泽东思想的宣传队和播种机。每一个指战员都懂得：毛泽东思想是全党全军全国一切工作的指导方针。毛主席的话，威信最高，威力最大，群众一听就懂，一用就灵。人民群众一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，就会产生改造社会，改造自然的伟大力量。因此，不论在什么时候或什么地方，指战员们都以最高的积极性和最大的热情，向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想，做到了手不离毛主席的书，口不离毛主席的话，心不离毛主席的思想，行动不离毛主席的教导。他们走到哪里，就把毛泽东思想宣传到哪里。解放军某部防化连，在一次三千里路的长途行军中，千方百计向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想，全连成了一支出色的毛泽东思想宣传队。连队党支部在制订行军计划时，首先制订宣传毛泽东思想计划；安排工作时，首先安排宣传毛泽东思想；检查群众工作情况时，首先检查宣传毛泽东思想的情况。他们说：“吃能忘，穿能忘，宣传毛泽东思想不能忘。”“风能停，雨能停，宣传毛泽东思想不能停。”行军路上，他们不放过任何一个宣传毛泽东思想的机会。每逢路过人多的地方，他们都要演唱宣传毛泽东思想的文娱节目和革命歌曲。部队一进村，战士们首先在黑板上写毛主席语录。有一天，部队走了一百二十多里，来到宿营地时，已是晚上十一点了，四个小时以后，部队还要继续行军。这时副指导员毛振华还像往常一样，仔细地检查了全村的黑板报。当他发现有一块黑板还没写完时，就和战士们一起打上灯笼写完。凡是宿营在一天以上的地方，连里的学习毛主席著作积极分子，都主动向人民群众传播活学活用毛主席著作的经验。走在队伍前面开路的同志，每经过一块大石头，一面墙壁，一个村口，一棵大树，都要写上或贴上毛主席语录。卫生员给社员看一次病，都要向病人宣传毛泽东思想。他们就是这样，向沿途三十二个县，三百多个村庄的人民群众宣传了毛泽东思想。做到了村村撒红种，天天搞宣传，一路三千里，里里不断线。人民群众感激地说：“解放军给我们送来了革命的真经，送来了毛泽东思想。”
    在行军中怎样宣传好毛泽东思想呢？根据许多部队的经验，可概括为以下几点：
    宣传毛泽东思想，一定要联系实际，密切结合中心。这就要求指战员们，首先自己要关心国家大事，要懂得党的方针政策和每一时期全党、全军、全民的中心任务。在这方面，有些部队做得非常出色。今年三四月间，河北省邢台地区发生严重的地震灾害。为了帮助群众恢复生产，重建家园，解放军某部组织了一支上万人的毛泽东思想宣传大军，在地方党委的统一领导下，分成千百支分队，像当年老八路一样，打起背包，背上干粮，带上毛主席著作，扛着语录牌，顶风冒雨，爬山越野，奔向邢台地区每个村庄城镇。干部战士一面帮助群众恢复生产，一面和贫下中农一起，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，使灾区人民在困难的时候，看到了光明，提高了勇气。他们面对着地震造成的严重灾害，表现了“房倒志不倒，地动心不摇”的英雄气概，发扬了一心为公，舍己为人的集体主义精神，自力更生，奋发图强，发展生产，重建家园。整个灾区出现了“人换精神地换貌”的崭新气象。这支部队在地震灾区，历时一个多月，走遍十九个县、市，五千三百多个生产大队，向三百九十多万群众宣传了伟大的毛泽东思想。这是结合当时当地的中心工作，宣传毛泽东思想的最突出的例子。当前，我国人民，正在进行一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，正在沿着党的八届十一中全会所指引的道路奋勇前进，正在大学大用毛主席著作，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。在这种情况下，向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想，就要大力宣传毛主席亲自主持召开的党的八届十一中全会公报的精神和毛主席亲自主持制订的“十六条”。无论走到什么地方，都要和人民群众一起学习毛主席著作，一起交流学习心得体会，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新阶段。
    宣传毛泽东思想，要针对不同对象，采取多种形式。有些连队除了和群众一起学习毛主席著作外，还采取了说故事讲英雄人物事迹的办法。学习“老三篇”时，就结合介绍张思德、白求恩、老愚公的事迹，大力宣传在毛泽东思想哺育下涌现出的一代共产主义新人，如雷锋、王杰、刘英俊、蔡永祥等人的事迹。有条件的地方，还可以放映幻灯，展览照片，演唱文艺节目和革命歌曲。
    宣传毛泽东思想，要言行一致，不仅自己要学好毛主席著作，还要大力发扬人民解放军爱人民、为人民的光荣传统，大力发扬三八作风，严格遵守三大纪律八项注意。这种行动本身，就是最有力的毛泽东思想的宣传。（附图片）
    走一路，红一路。沈阳部队某部四连每到一个村庄，刚放下背包，第一件事就是张贴毛主席语录，让群众处处都看到毛主席的指示。
