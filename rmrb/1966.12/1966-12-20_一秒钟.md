"Tick-tock, tick-tock, ...", one second after another, years and months are composed of countless "one seconds." We should cherish every second, letting each second sparkle with brilliant fireworks for the revolution.

One second, in the arduous years of war, often determines the outcome of a battle. During the War of Liberation, there was such an incident: our army was one second faster than the enemy, which accelerated the victory of the battle.

In the great era of Mao Zedong, what profound meaning does the phrase "one second" hold! Within countless "one seconds," steel flowers soar into the sky, "black gold" piles up into mountains, oil flows like water, and the land yields millions and thousands of grains and cotton.

One second, a fleeting "one second," a critical "one second," a crucial moment's "one second," often is a stern test: whether one is a true revolutionary or a false one; whether one acts for the public or for personal gain; whether one bravely sacrifices for the revolution or becomes a disgraceful deserter.

We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Let us make contributions to the Chinese Revolution and the world revolution in every "one second," making each "one second" shine brightly. Throughout the entire revolutionary journey, in every "one second," we must listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow them, and act upon them!

### “一秒钟”

    “一秒钟”
    战士　林富高　谈会治   齐治国　戴顺财
    “滴嗒，滴嗒，……”，一秒又一秒，年年月月是由许多个“一秒钟”组成的。我们应珍惜每一秒钟，让每一秒钟为革命迸发出绚烂的火花。
    一秒钟，在艰苦的战争岁月，往往是决定战争胜负的一个关键。解放战争中曾有这样的事迹，我军比敌人抢前“一秒钟”，就使战斗加速取得了辉煌的胜利。
    在伟大的毛泽东时代，“一秒钟”这个字眼，该有多么深刻的意义！就在许多个“一秒钟”内，钢花冲天起，“黑金”堆成山，石油如水流，大地吐出粮棉万万千。
    一秒钟，须臾而过的“一秒钟”，千钧一发的“一秒钟”，紧急关头的“一秒钟”，往往又是严峻的考验：是真革命，还是假革命；是为公，还是为私；是为革命英勇献身，还是当可耻的逃兵。
    我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，让我们在每“一秒钟”里都能为中国革命和世界革命做出贡献，使每“一秒钟”都放射出夺目的亮光。在整个革命的道路上，在每“一秒钟”内，都听毛主席的话，句句听，句句用，句句照办！
