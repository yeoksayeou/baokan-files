The Ministry of the Interior recently issued a notice to the civil affairs departments of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions regarding the implementation of support for the military and preferential treatment for dependents during the 1967 Spring Festival.

The notice states that we are welcoming the new year and Spring Festival of 1967 in a situation of excellent international and domestic conditions, especially as our socialist revolution enters a new stage and the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works reaches a new high. The notice emphasizes that the activities to support the military and provide preferential treatment for dependents during the 1967 Spring Festival must keep pace with the current excellent revolutionary situation. Therefore, these activities must closely follow the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the socialist education movement, using various appropriate forms to widely publicize Chairman Mao's teachings on the significance of the people's army and supporting the military and providing preferential treatment for dependents. They must also widely publicize the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army in defending the motherland, participating in the socialist revolution and construction, and emphasize that the People's Liberation Army is a military force that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, serving the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly. This will help everyone love the People's Liberation Army more and learn from it better, further establishing the social custom of supporting the military and providing preferential treatment for dependents.

Political concern must be given to the families of martyrs, military personnel, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, further organizing them to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially the "Three Constantly Read Articles," treating them as guiding principles. Through study, they should overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness, carry out ideological revolutionization, strive for self-reliance and hard work, and "carry forward revolutionary traditions and strive for greater glory." They should make greater contributions in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. Currently, emphasis should be placed on the ideological and political work of disabled soldiers and demobilized soldiers. They should be correctly guided to actively participate in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist education movement with local and unit masses, thoroughly criticizing the capitalist reactionary line, and firmly defending the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao. They should be educated to always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, always pay attention to combining with the masses, never separating from the masses, always holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the Four Firsts, carrying forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, strictly observing the Three Major Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention, and resolutely responding to Comrade Lin Biao's call to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming good soldiers of Chairman Mao. On their respective production and work posts, they should play a leading role in grasping the revolution and promoting production. Counties, cities, city districts, and people's communes can also hold meetings for the families of martyrs, military personnel, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, as well as meetings for active members, to exchange experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works, so as to promote the activity of organizing the families of martyrs, military personnel, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers to study Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

In terms of living conditions, efforts must be made to help the families of martyrs, military personnel, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers solve practical difficulties they cannot resolve on their own. A serious review of the welfare and resettlement work in 1966, especially the preferential treatment and subsidies, must be conducted. For issues left unresolved in welfare and resettlement work, thorough research and swift handling are required. For issues handled improperly, appropriate rehandling must be done.

The notice also requires local authorities to appropriately organize visits and entertainment activities. For border defense and naval forces, as well as soldiers and disabled soldiers in military hospitals and rest homes, visits must be organized. Military-civilian joint entertainment activities should be carried out, and opinions from the military regarding local issues should be solicited to further improve military-political and military-civilian relations.

The notice points out that during the aforementioned activities, attention must be paid to breaking old customs and establishing new ones, eliminating bourgeois practices, and promoting proletarian practices, ensuring that the entire activity is permeated with a revolutionary spirit.
