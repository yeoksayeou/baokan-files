A sheep in our brigade gave birth but had no milk. I used my own milk to nurse the lamb to health. The commune members wanted to learn from me, but I said: Don't learn from me, you should study "In the Service of the People" well.

My husband is a shepherd. Since he took on the job of herding sheep, I have also devoted my whole heart to the sheep. I often think: Chairman Mao tells us to learn from Zhang Zedong, Dr. Bethune, and Old Man Carving Mountains. Zhang Zedong was a Long March veteran who sacrificed his life for the revolution by making charcoal; Dr. Bethune was a foreigner who gave his life for the Chinese revolution. Such people are worth learning from for a lifetime. How should we learn? We should follow Chairman Mao's words and do a good job in the revolutionary work. Herding sheep is a revolutionary task. Helping my husband herd the sheep well is like contributing to the revolution. With this in mind, I often feed the sheep with my own flour. Usually, I use yellow soil to keep the sheep pen clean and dry. At night, I often go to check around the sheep pen. When a ewe gives birth, I become the lamb's nanny. In the cold winter, I am afraid the sheep will get cold, so I use our family's mats to block the wind and cold from the pen door.

This spring, a ewe in the brigade gave birth but had no milk. The lamb was about to starve to death. What should I do? Should I let the lamb die? No. At that time, I thought: We are poor peasants and should follow Chairman Mao's words. We cannot stand by and watch the collective suffer losses. We must find a way to save the lamb. My husband and I took this issue to heart and studied "In the Service of the People" together. We agreed that Chairman Mao told us to serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly," so we should follow his instructions. At that time, I had just given birth and had a lot of milk, more than my child could consume. I thought, if I give some of my excess milk to the lamb, it might save the lamb. I shared this idea with my husband. He said, "I am happy to see you have such good thoughts!" So, I squeezed out some milk to feed the lamb. Everyone saw that I treated the lamb like a baby and saved its life, saying I had good thoughts.

I did this small thing, and everyone said they wanted to learn from me. I said, "What is there to learn from me? I just did a good deed because I studied Chairman Mao's book and followed his words. If you want to learn, then study 'In the Service of the People' well."

    好好学习《为人民服务》

    我男人是拦羊员。自从他担任拦羊工作，我也把整个心都操在羊身上了。我常常这样想：毛主席叫咱向张思德、白求恩、老愚公学习。人家张思德是长征干部，为革命烧木炭牺牲了；白求恩是外国人，为中国革命献出了生命。这样的人，值得咱学习一辈子。怎样学？就应该听毛主席的话，搞好革命工作。拦羊是一项革命工作，帮我男人拦好羊，就等于为革命出了一份力。抱着这个目的，我就经常把自己的麸面给羊吃。平时，我用绵黄土把羊圈垫得干干的。夜里，我也常起来到羊圈周围看一看。母羊生羔了，我又当羊羔的保姆。在严冬，我怕羊受冷受冻，就用自己家的席子挡住圈门，防风寒。
    今年春天，队里一只母羊生羔后没有奶，眼看这只羊羔就要饿死。怎么办呢？难道叫这只羊羔死去？不能。当时我想：咱是贫农，应该听毛主席的话，不能眼看集体受损失，一定要想办法保住羊羔。我们夫妻俩就带着这个问题，一起学习了《为人民服务》。我们一致的意见是，毛主席叫咱“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，咱就应该照办。当时，我生下孩子不久，奶很多，孩子吃不了。我就想，把我多余的奶给羊羔喂一部分，不就可以救活羊羔吗？我把这个打算给我男人一说。他说：“你有这么好的思想我当然高兴！”于是，我就挤出一部分奶汁喂羊羔。大伙见我把羊羔当娃娃看待，救活了羊羔，都说我思想好。
    我做了这点点小事，大家都说要向我学习。我说：“咱有啥学头？就是做了点好事，也是因为学了毛主席的书，听了毛主席的话。要学么，大家就好好学习《为人民服务》。”
