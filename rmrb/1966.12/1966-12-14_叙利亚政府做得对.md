The Syrian government is right.

On December 8, the Syrian government decided to seize all the assets of the "Iraq Petroleum Company," controlled by Western monopolies, in Syria as compensation for the company's unreasonable delay in paying Syria's transit oil taxes. The government also announced an increase in transit taxes for foreign oil. The Syrian government's just action against imperialist economic plunder and in defense of national interests is correct and commendable! The Chinese people firmly support it!

For a long time, the "Iraq Petroleum Company," controlled by the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands, has been plundering the oil resources of Arab countries and brutally exploiting the blood and sweat of the Arab people. Imperialist forces such as the United States and Britain have consistently ignored the sovereignty of Arab countries, acting arrogantly and recklessly, as if they were the masters of the Arab region. The peoples of various Arab countries have long been unable to tolerate such banditry and have been continuously fighting against it.

Chairman Mao said, "The jackals of imperialism should remember that the era when they could arbitrarily manipulate the fate of mankind and arbitrarily carve up Asian and African countries has passed and will not return." The decisive measures taken by the Syrian government are another blow to imperialist forces.

The Syrian government's just actions have been praised by the peoples of various Arab countries. Iraqi Prime Minister Talib issued a statement clearly supporting Syria's position and attitude. This reflects the will of the peoples of various Arab countries to unite against imperialism. We are confident that as long as the peoples of various Arab countries further strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, they will certainly be able to defeat the imperialist conspiracies and achieve new victories in the struggle to defend national interests.

    叙利亚政府做得对
    本报评论员
    十二月八日，叙利亚政府决定没收西方垄断资本控制的
  “伊拉克石油公司”在叙利亚的全部财产，作为这家公司无理拖欠叙利亚过境石油税的抵偿，并宣布提高外国石油的过境税。叙利亚政府这一反对帝国主义经济掠夺、维护民族利益的正义行动，做得对，做得好！中国人民坚决支持！
    长期以来，美、英、法、荷控制下的“伊拉克石油公司”，大量地掠夺阿拉伯国家的石油资源，残酷地吮吸阿拉伯人民的血汗。美英等帝国主义势力一贯无视阿拉伯国家的主权，骄横跋扈，胡作非为，似乎它们是阿拉伯地区的主人。阿拉伯各国人民，早就对这种强盗行径感到不能容忍了，并且不断同它们进行了斗争。
    毛主席说：“帝国主义的豺狼们应该记住，由他们任意摆布人类命运、任意宰割亚非国家的时代，已经一去不复返了。”叙利亚政府所采取的断然措施，就是对帝国主义势力的又一个打击。
    叙利亚政府的正义行动，受到阿拉伯各国人民的赞扬。伊拉克总理塔列布发表声明，明确支持叙利亚的立场和态度。这反映了阿拉伯各国人民团结反帝的意志。我们深信，只要阿拉伯各国人民进一步加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够击败帝国主义的阴谋，在维护民族利益的斗争中取得新胜利。
