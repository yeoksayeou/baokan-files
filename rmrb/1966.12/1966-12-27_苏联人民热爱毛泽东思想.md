We are the crew of the Mao Zedong era, and also propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. In the waiting room, we read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and sing songs from the Little Red Book to friends from all over the world. We have been enthusiastically welcomed. In our work, we deeply feel that the revolutionary people of the world love Chairman Mao immensely and have unwavering faith in Mao Zedong Thought. Today, under the leadership of the revisionist clique, the Soviet people are also trying every means to express their love for Chairman Mao.

One day, a group of Soviet people got off a plane transiting to Hanoi. They came to the waiting room, and a few Soviet friends quietly walked to the bookshelf, picked up the Russian edition of Chairman Mao's works, and read them carefully. Others listened intently as we recited Chairman Mao's quotations, until the Soviet embassy staff came to take them away, and they reluctantly waved goodbye to us. What was even more touching was that one Soviet friend used gestures to communicate with our service staff, hoping to get the Mao Zedong badge she was wearing. He went to the sofa, and when no one was paying attention, he handed the service staff a commemorative badge from under the coffee table. She opened it and found it was a worn-out Stalin badge. Our service staff, with tears of excitement, immediately took off her own Mao Zedong badge and carefully gave it to the Soviet friend.

The revolutionary people of the world love Mao Zedong Thought the most, and only a small handful of reactionaries desperately try to oppose Mao Zedong Thought because they fear the truth the most. There was a bad element from the Soviet Union who often came to the airport to pick up and send off passengers. Seeing us recite quotations to the passengers, he deliberately ran over, circled around us, and made all sorts of strange faces. His disruptive behavior aroused the discontent of many foreign friends present. We then loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations to that Soviet: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." After hearing this, he restrained himself a bit. We then loudly recited together: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed." At this point, he could not hold back any longer and slunk away. Modern revisionists are like this; they fear Mao Zedong Thought the most and fear the truth the most. They are paper tigers.

    苏联人民热爱毛泽东思想
    我们是毛泽东时代的乘务员，也是毛泽东思想的宣传员。我们在候机室里，向来自世界各地的朋友们，读《毛主席语录》，唱语录歌，受到了热烈欢迎。在我们的工作中，我们深深感到全世界革命人民无比热爱毛主席，无比信仰毛泽东思想。今天在修正主义集团领导之下的苏联人民，也是想尽一切办法，表达了他们对毛主席的热爱。
    有一天，从一架到河内去的过境飞机上，下来了一批苏联人。他们到了候机室，有几位苏联朋友悄悄地走到书架面前，拿起了俄文版的毛主席著作，细细地阅读起来。另一些人，出神地听着我们念毛主席的语录，直到苏联大使馆的人来把他们叫走，才不得不依依不舍地向我们挥手告别。更使人感动的是，有一位苏联朋友，跟我们的服务员用手势比划，希望能得到她身上戴着的毛主席像章。他走到沙发前面，趁人不注意的时候，从茶几底下递给那位服务员一枚纪念章。她打开一看，是一枚戴旧了的斯大林像纪念章。我们的服务员含着激动的眼泪，立刻摘下了自己胸前的毛主席像章，珍重地送给了那位苏联朋友。
    全世界革命人民最最热爱毛泽东思想，只有一小撮反动分子拚命想反对毛泽东思想，因为他们最害怕真理。有一个苏联坏家伙，他经常到飞机场来接送客人。他看到我们向旅客念语录，就故意跑来围着我们打转，作出种种怪相。他的捣乱行为，引起许多在场的外国朋友的不满。我们就大声向那个苏联人念毛主席的语录：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”他听了以后，就收敛了一些。我们又更高声地集体朗读：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡”。这时候，他沉不住气了，灰溜溜地跑掉了。现代修正主义者就是这样，他们最害怕毛泽东思想，最害怕真理。他们是纸老虎。
