One morning, Yang Zhixin, a student from Zigong, Sichuan, went to the reception station of the Beijing Water and Drainage Design Institute to request leave from the platoon leader, promising to return by noon. He then went to the State Council reception station on behalf of his classmates.

The State Council reception station began receiving visitors at 9 a.m. Due to the large number of people, he had to wait until after 10 a.m. to be received. After finishing his report, it was already 11:35 a.m. He rushed to the bus stop and saw a long line of people waiting. If he ran back, although he wouldn't be late, it would be tiring and stressful. Just as he was hesitating, Chairman Mao's teachings echoed in his mind: "We must strengthen discipline, resolutely carry out orders, implement policies, and adhere to the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. ... We do not allow any phenomenon that disrupts discipline to exist."

With this resolve, he started running back along the street. Soon, he was sweating and out of breath. Unfortunately, the wind picked up, blowing dust into his eyes. But he kept running, rubbing his eyes as he went. He thought to himself, "Yang, this is a test of your discipline. See if you can strictly adhere to it."

When he returned to the reception station and reported back to the platoon leader, it was five minutes before noon. The platoon commended him, and his classmates praised him, saying he truly put Chairman Mao's teachings into action.

    为了严守纪律
    一天上午，来自四川自贡市的杨之信同学，在北京给水排水设计院接待站向排长请了假，保证在十二点以前回来，就带着同学们的委托，到国务院接待站去了。
    国务院接待站九点钟开始接待，因为人多，他一直等到十点多才被接待。等汇报完，已经是十一点三十五分了。他跑到停车站一看，乘车的人排了好长。要是跑回去，虽然误不了时间，但是够累够紧张的。正在犹豫，毛主席的教导在耳边响起来：“必须提高纪律性，坚决执行命令，执行政策，执行三大纪律八项注意，……不允许任何破坏纪律的现象存在。”对，学习了三大纪律，就要自觉遵守纪律，绝不能因为怕累而耽误时间，破坏纪律。
    决心一下，他就顺着大街往回跑。不大工夫，汗出来了，气喘开了。天也不凑巧，偏偏刮起大风，卷起阵阵尘土，直往眼里扑。但他边揉眼睛边跑。他暗自想：小杨啊！这是考验你的时候，看你能不能严格遵守纪律。
    当他回到接待站，找到排长销假时，十二点还差五分。连里表扬了他，同学们也都赞扬他，说他真正把毛主席的教导落实到行动上了。
