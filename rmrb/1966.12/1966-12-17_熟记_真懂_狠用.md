    Editor's Note: Comrade Lin Biao has repeatedly advocated for the study of Chairman Mao's quotations. He pointed out: To truly master Mao Zedong Thought, one must repeatedly study Chairman Mao's many fundamental viewpoints. Some aphorisms should be memorized and repeatedly studied and applied. To receive timely guidance from Mao Zedong Thought in various periods and situations, one should, in conjunction with the situation, tasks, the thoughts of the masses, and work conditions, frequently study Chairman Mao's relevant quotations.

    Chairman Mao's words are of the highest level, the highest authority, and the greatest power. Every sentence is a truth, one sentence is worth ten thousand. Chairman Mao's words are the most straightforward, the most vivid, and the easiest to understand. Each of Chairman Mao's quotations is a guideline for our thoughts and actions.

    In 1964, the General Political Department, based on Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, compiled and printed "Quotations from Chairman Mao," which was warmly welcomed by the entire army and the people of the nation. Especially during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and Red Guards have, in conjunction with practical struggles, studied and applied the quotations, creating a vast red sea of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" everywhere. The nation has formed a mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

    Practice has proven that studying Chairman Mao's quotations is an excellent method for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to master Mao Zedong Thought. It is lively, practical, and yields immediate results.

    Chairman Mao's quotations must be repeatedly studied and memorized. Chairman Mao's many important aphorisms and fundamental viewpoints cannot be fully understood after studying them once or twice. One must study them repeatedly in different situations, for different tasks, and for different problems. The more times one studies, the deeper the understanding. Once important aphorisms are memorized and fundamental viewpoints are thoroughly understood, they can be applied freely and universally.

    Studying Chairman Mao's quotations requires diligent effort in application. Only by applying them well can one truly study them well. "Carry the quotations with you and study them anytime." Any problem can find a solution in Chairman Mao's quotations. As people say: "Chairman Mao is by our side."

    We must respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, better study and apply the quotations, actively study and apply, integrate study and application, use Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful ideological weapon to transform both the subjective and objective worlds, and push the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

    Memorize, Understand, and Apply Thoroughly

    Certain Unit of the PLA, Lü Qīobīn, Sūn Táng, Lü Zǐjiā

    Our unit's Third Artillery Battery has, since July 1964, launched a movement to memorize, explain, and apply Chairman Mao's quotations. This has effectively promoted the ideological transformation of soldiers and cadres, making all work in the battery significantly progress, entering the ranks of the "Four Good Units," and becoming a battery with outstanding study of Chairman Mao's works.

    Through more than two years of practice, they deeply felt that memorizing, understanding, and applying thoroughly are several important links to studying Chairman Mao's works and truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought.

    Comrade Lin Biao instructed us: "To truly master Mao Zedong Thought, one must repeatedly study Chairman Mao's many fundamental viewpoints. Some aphorisms should be memorized and repeatedly studied and applied." Why should some of Chairman Mao's quotations be memorized? The Third Artillery Battery realized the importance of this instruction through their practice of studying Chairman Mao's works. They found that some comrades, when encountering problems, would look for answers in Chairman Mao's works, but because they had not memorized them beforehand, they had to hastily search. Sometimes, after flipping through for a long time, they still couldn't find the "address." Those who had memorized Chairman Mao's quotations well, however, could immediately recall Chairman Mao's teachings when encountering problems, engage in ideological struggle, and use Chairman Mao's words to guide their actions. From this, they understood that to follow Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, one must first know what Chairman Mao has said and what instructions he has given. The soldiers understood the importance of memorizing Chairman Mao's quotations, so everyone worked hard to memorize them. By now, the comrades in the Third Artillery Battery can generally memorize over a hundred quotations from Chairman Mao, some soldiers can memorize the entire "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and even this year's new recruits can memorize forty to fifty quotations.

    The Third Artillery Battery, from the beginning of launching the movement to memorize Chairman Mao's quotations, clearly understood that they must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must be proficient in it and apply it. The purpose of being proficient is entirely for application." We realized that memorizing is not the goal itself but is merely a method of study. The goal is to apply thoroughly.

    Since the goal is to apply thoroughly, memorizing Chairman Mao's quotations cannot be for the sake of memorizing, aimlessly memorizing, but should be for the sake of applying, memorizing with a purpose, and memorizing what is urgently needed first. The Third Artillery Battery did this according to this principle. The Party branch, in each stage, always selected Chairman Mao's relevant quotations based on the problems appearing in the soldiers' and cadres' thoughts and work, requiring everyone to memorize and remember them, link them to reality, and implement actions. For example, when they first took on the task of burning bricks, some comrades were afraid of the heat and fatigue. Thus, they selected and memorized quotations such as, "What is work? Work is struggle.... The more difficult the place, the more one should go, this is what a good comrade does." "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Everyone memorized and remembered them, and when working, it was as if Chairman Mao was in front of them commanding the battle, with boundless energy. Soldier Li Qīngshān was not adapted to high-temperature work and fainted several times, but as soon as he woke up, he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings and immediately continued the battle. In this way of integrating study and application, the entire battery displayed the spirit of enduring hardships and hard work, with production exceeding quotas every month. After solving the problem of fearing hardship and improving production efficiency, new problems arose: some comrades only sought quantity, not quality, and many bricks did not meet the standards. The Party branch, after research, realized that this was a lack of revolutionary responsibility, so they organized everyone to select and memorize Chairman Mao's teachings on "serving the people" and "being responsible to the people," making everyone constantly alert themselves. Soldier Xíng Lìduān, when loading the bricks, put a discovered defective brick into the car. At this time, he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our responsibility is to be responsible to the people. Every word, every action, every policy must benefit the people. If there are errors, they must be corrected, this is being responsible to the people." A car full of bricks was loaded, and Xíng Lìduān's ideological struggle reached its peak. He thought: This defective brick, if put into the kiln, would produce a defective product, harming the people's interests, which is not in line with Chairman Mao's teachings and must be corrected. Thus, he unloaded the car of bricks one by one, picked out the defective brick, and reloaded the car.

    The comrades of the Third Artillery Battery are like this, selecting and memorizing Chairman Mao's quotations with problems in mind. They started from application, memorized for the sake of applying, memorized one, remembered one, applied one, and implemented the "memorize" into "apply." They realized from practice that only by memorizing for the sake of applying can one have a clear purpose for memorizing, and only by memorizing can one apply, not turning into rote memorization.

    They felt that after memorizing, to truly apply thoroughly, one must truly understand the memorized Chairman Mao's quotations. True understanding means truly understanding the spirit and essence of Chairman Mao's instructions, not just staying on the surface level of words and phrases. Only by grasping the spirit and essence of Chairman Mao's instructions can one master Mao Zedong Thought. For example, many comrades in the Third Artillery Battery once thought that by memorizing the ten manifestations of "liberalism" pointed out by Chairman Mao and frequently checking themselves against them, they would not commit the mistake of liberalism. The results were not ideal. Later, everyone repeatedly studied the article "Oppose Liberalism," and only then did they realize that Chairman Mao pointed out: "The source of liberalism is the selfishness of the petty bourgeoisie." Therefore, only by uprooting this "selfishness" can one fundamentally eliminate liberalism. If one only deals with the surface phenomena passively, one cannot achieve the goal.

    Memorizing and truly understanding leads to applying thoroughly; conversely, only by applying thoroughly can one truly understand and memorize. Because only through application, only through personal practice, can one truly grasp the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions and firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings. For this reason, after studying a quotation or an instruction from Chairman Mao, one should repeatedly compare and repeatedly apply. As long as one listens to Chairman Mao's words and acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions, repeatedly working on transforming one's worldview, then each application will yield new insights and new gains. Only in this way can one understand Chairman Mao's teachings more deeply, remember them more firmly, and thus apply them better.

专栏：

    编者按：林彪同志一再提倡学习毛主席语录。他指出：为了把毛泽东思想真正学到手，要反复学习毛主席的许多基本观点，有些警句最好要背熟，反复学习，反复运用。为了在各个时期、各种情况下，都能得到毛泽东思想的及时指导，应当结合形势、任务、群众的思想情况和工作情况，经常学习毛主席的有关语录。
    毛主席的话，水平最高，威信最高，威力最大，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。毛主席的话，最通俗，最生动，最好懂。毛主席的每一条语录，都是我们思想和行动的准则。
    一九六四年总政治部根据林彪同志指示编印的《毛主席语录》，受到全军和全国人民的热烈欢迎。特别是无产阶级文化大革命以来，广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子和红卫兵小将们，结合斗争的实践，学语录，用语录，到处是一片《毛主席语录》的红色海洋。全国已经形成了一个活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。
    实践证明，学习毛主席语录，是广大工农兵群众掌握毛泽东思想的一个好方法，生动活泼，联系实际，最能收到立竿见影的效果。
    毛主席语录要反复学习，熟读牢记。毛主席的许多重要警句和基本观点，不是学习一次、两次就能完全领会的。一定要结合不同的情况，不同的任务，针对不同的问题，一遍又一遍地学。学的次数越多，体会也就越深。重要警句背熟了，基本观点吃透了，就可以运用自如，一通百通。
    学习毛主席语录，要在用字上狠下功夫。只有用得好，才算真正学得好。“语录身上带，随时学起来。”任何问题都可以从毛主席语录里找到解决的钥匙。正像人们所说的：“毛主席就像在我们的身边。”
    我们要响应林彪同志的号召，更好地学语录，用语录，活学活用，学用结合，用毛泽东思想这个强大的思想武器，改造主观世界和客观世界，把学习毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新阶段。
    熟记　真懂　狠用
    解放军某部　吕乔宾　孙堂　吕子家
    我部三炮连，从一九六四年七月份起，开展了会背、会讲、会用毛主席语录的运动，有效地促进了战士和干部的思想革命化，使全连各项工作都有显著的进步，跨入了四好行列，成为学习毛主席著作比较突出的连队。
    通过两年多的实践，他们深深体会到，熟记、真懂、狠用是学好毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想真正学到手的几个重要环节。
    林彪同志指示我们：“为了把毛泽东思想真正学到手，要反复学习毛主席的许多基本观点，有些警句最好要背熟，反复学习，反复运用。”为什么要把毛主席的一些语录背熟呢？三炮连是在战士们学习毛主席著作的实践中认识到这一指示的重要性的。他们发现，有些同志碰到了问题，想到毛主席著作中去找答案，但由于平时没有记熟，只好临渴掘井，现翻现找。有时翻了半天，还找不到“门牌号码”，形成了有“的”无“矢”。而那些把毛主席语录记得很熟的战士，一遇到问题，毛主席的教导就在耳边响起来，就能使他开展思想斗争，就能用毛主席的话指挥自己的行动。从这里，他们体会到，要听毛主席的话，要按毛主席的指示办事，首先应该知道毛主席究竟说过哪些话，究竟作过哪些指示。战士们知道熟记毛主席语录的重要意义，大家就下功夫熟背熟记。到现在为止，三炮连的同志一般都能熟背毛主席语录一百条以上，有的战士能把《毛主席语录》全部背下来，即使是今年入伍的新战士，也能背熟四五十条了。
    三炮连在开展熟背毛主席语录的运动中，一开始就明确了必须牢记毛主席的教导：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”我们认识到，熟背的本身不是目的，只是一种学习方法，目的在于狠用。
    既然目的在于狠用，那末，熟背毛主席语录，就不能是为背而背，漫无目的地背，而是应该为用而背，带着问题背，急用先背。三炮连是按着这个原则做的，党支部在每个阶段总是针对战士和干部在思想上、工作上出现的问题，选出毛主席的有关语录，要求大家背熟记牢，联系实际，落实行动。例如，当他们刚开始担任烧砖任务时，有些同志怕热怕累，于是，他们选背了“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。……越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”等语录。大家背熟了，记牢了，干起活来，就像毛主席在眼前指挥大家作战一样，浑身有使不完的劲。战士李庆山不适应高温作业，昏倒几次，但是他一醒过来，想起毛主席的这些教导，就立刻继续参加战斗。就在这样的学用结合下，全连发扬了吃大苦、耐大劳的硬骨头精神，生产月月超额。在怕苦的问题解决，生产效率提高以后，又出现了新的问题：有些同志只求数量，不求质量，许多砖不合规格。党支部研究后，认识到这是缺乏革命责任感的表现，就组织大家选背毛主席关于“为人民服务”、“向人民负责”的教导的语录，使大家随时警惕自己。战士邢立端在运坯时，把已经发现的一块坏坯装进了车。这时，他想起了毛主席的教导：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，如果有了错误，定要改正，这就叫向人民负责。”一车坯装满，邢立端的思想斗争也达到了高潮。他想：这块坏坯装进窑，就要出废品，就要损害人民的利益，这是不符合毛主席的教导的，定要改正。于是他把一车坯一块块地卸下来，拣出坏坯，重新装车。
    三炮连的同志，就是这样带着问题去选背毛主席语录的。他们从用字出发，为用而背，背一条，记一条，用一条，把“背”字落实到“用”字。他们从实践中认识到，只有为用而背，背才有明确的目的，背了才能用，才不至于形成死记硬背。
    他们体会到，熟背后要真能狠用，还必须对背熟了的毛主席语录做到真正理解。所谓真正理解，就是要真正懂得毛主席指示的精神实质，而不是停留在字句上、表面上的了解。只有领会了毛主席指示的精神实质，才能学到毛主席的立场、观点、方法，才能把毛泽东思想掌握起来。例如，三炮连的许多同志，曾经以为背熟了毛主席所指出的“自由主义”的十一种表现，经常对照检查自己，就可以不犯自由主义的毛病。结果并不理想。后来大家反复学习了《反对自由主义》这篇文章，才认识到，毛主席指出：“自由主义的来源，在于小资产阶级的自私自利性”。因此，只有把“自私自利”这个根子挖掉，才能从根本上铲除自由主义，如果只从表面现象上去做些消极防御，是达不到目的的。
    熟记，真懂，才能狠用；反过来，也只有狠用，才能真懂，才能记熟。因为只有通过用，只有通过亲身的实践，才能真正领会毛主席指示的精神，才能牢牢地记住毛主席的教导。为此，当学习了毛主席的一条语录，一项指示后，就应该反复对照，反复应用。只要听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，反反复复在改造世界观上下功夫，那末，每用一次，总会有新的体会，新的收获。只有这样，才能把毛主席的教导懂得更透，记得更牢，从而也才能用得更好。
