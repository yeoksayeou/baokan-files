The "Long March Red Guards" of Jinzhou, taking the People's Liberation Army as their example, persistently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, focus on ideological issues, dare to eliminate personal interests for the sake of the public, care for the collective, observe the three major disciplines and eight points for attention, and humbly learn from workers and peasants, achieving good results.

Editor's Note: The Long March-style full-distance walking linkup is a new phenomenon that emerged during China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a new creation by revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. How to better organize the Long March-style walking linkup? This is a question of great concern to revolutionary teachers and students. Many revolutionary teachers and students have asked our newspaper: What preparations should be made before the Long March? How can one achieve greater gains during the Long March? How can one ensure the successful completion of the Long March from beginning to end? Today, our newspaper introduces the experience of the "Long March Red Guards" of the Jinzhou Railway Locomotive School, which can serve as a reference for revolutionary young people preparing to undertake the Long March-style full-distance walking linkup.

Their experience, in essence, is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seriously learn from the People's Liberation Army, and emphasize politics in everything. From the preparatory work before departure, they prioritized the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, making the Long March process a journey of transforming one's soul with Mao Zedong Thought. In this way, they had a bright beacon on their journey forward, and the strength to overcome any difficulties and hardships. After such a Long March training, our young generation will definitely be able to withstand and overcome any difficulties and dangers, growing into staunch successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause in the great storms of revolution.

Our reporter reports: The "Long March Red Guards" of the Jinzhou Railway Locomotive School in Liaoning Province seriously learn from the People's Liberation Army, emphasizing politics in everything. They organize the Long March team with Mao Zedong Thought, taking ideological preparation as the most fundamental preparation. During the march, they focus on ideological issues, strictly follow the three major disciplines and eight points for attention, carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, and demand the same high standards from themselves as the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to undertake the Long March, making each team member take a solid step forward in ideological transformation.

Arming the Long March Team with Mao Zedong Thought

When preparing for the Long March, this team emphasized the need to arm the minds of the team members with Mao Zedong Thought. They believed that among all preparations, studying Mao Zedong Thought is the most fundamental.

When organizing the Long March team, some people in the school thought: "Why walk when there are vehicles to ride? That's asking for trouble." Revolutionary teachers and students who signed up for the "Long March Red Guards" discussed this issue seriously, studying Chairman Mao's teachings on how communists should face hardships and gain experience. After discussion, everyone agreed: "Asking for trouble" is a manifestation of conscious revolution. To revolutionize, one must have the spirit of asking for trouble. Someone said: "Different attitudes towards hardships reflect the two different worldviews of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Proletarian revolutionary warriors must dare to endure hardships and be willing to endure hardships." Someone else said: "To carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, we need to temper the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat." Everyone unanimously agreed: We must be the sturdy pines on the mountains, not the flowers in the greenhouse, and resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to temper ourselves in the great storms!

Among the students who signed up for the Long March, a few had the idea of taking the opportunity to sightsee. The team also organized a discussion on this issue. Everyone realized: Walking linkup is not for sightseeing, but for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, for familiarizing oneself with society, with the masses, and with class struggle. The fundamental purpose is to better study and understand Mao Zedong Thought and to better transform one's worldview.

Through these discussions, the significance of the Long March became clear, and the determination to march on foot was firm. Next, they studied how to deal with possible difficulties during the Long March. They anticipated that during the Long March, their legs might swell and blisters might form, eating and sleeping might be inconvenient, and someone might get sick. They considered all such problems.

How to deal with these problems? They followed Chairman Mao's teachings: Strategically, despise difficulties; tactically, take difficulties seriously.

They first analyzed the favorable conditions for overcoming difficulties. One is the support of the local people and party and government organs along the way, two is the power of the collective, three is the experience of the People's Liberation Army and other Long March teams; most importantly, having the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a guiding light, no matter how great the difficulties, they can be overcome. Then, they studied Chairman Mao's "Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Everyone agreed: The greatest difficulty is a lack of willpower and the inability to withstand tests; as long as one has revolutionary spirit and acts according to Mao Zedong Thought, everything will be manageable.

With a victorious confidence established, everyone then studied specific strategies to deal with the difficulties of the Long March and invited veteran Red Army soldiers who participated in the 25,000-li Long March to share their experiences.

They focused on ideological preparation. Is material preparation necessary? They believed that necessary material preparation is indispensable, but the question is what guiding ideology to use for material preparation. At the beginning, some team members suggested borrowing military uniforms and raincoats from the People's Liberation Army, and some team members requested economic assistance from the school. In response to this situation, the team organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on hard work and self-reliance, proposing the slogans "Strict ideological preparation, simple material preparation" and "Hard work for the Long March," and conducted necessary material preparation based on the principle of making do with what is available.

After a week of study and preparation, a team of fourteen people was organized under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

On the morning of October 30, the "Long March Red Guards" took an oath at the Jinzhou Martyrs' Cemetery, bade farewell to the revolutionary masses who came to see them off, and set off on their journey to the accompaniment of the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

Treating the Long March as a Process of Ideological Transformation

The warriors of the "Long March Red Guards" believed that the Long March is a process of eliminating personal interests for the sake of the public, a process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, a process of revolutionizing one's soul, and a process of promoting ideological transformation. During the Long March, non-proletarian thoughts in people's minds will inevitably manifest in various ways. To succeed in the Long March, one must emphasize politics and be good at grasping ideological issues, using Mao Zedong Thought to fight the ideological battle.

During the more than 1,000-li Long March, they placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all activities. Before departure, they studied Chairman Mao's works; before meetings, they studied Chairman Mao's works; when encountering problems, they studied Chairman Mao's works; after arriving at the campsite, they studied Chairman Mao's works.

On the third day of the march, many comrades had blisters on their feet, and the speed of the team's advance became slower and slower. One team member, eager to hurry, paid no heed to others and rushed forward. When comrades behind pointed out the problem, he did not accept it. He said: "If we walk so slowly, when will we reach our destination?"

This was not a simple matter of walking faster or slower. Comrade Zhang Baozhong, a demobilized soldier and the team's political instructor, believed that this involved the issue of understanding the significance of the Long March, the relationship between the individual and the collective, and possibly personal selfish thoughts. If this problem was not solved, the team members would not be united, and the fighting collective would disintegrate.

During the noon rest, he organized everyone to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and Chairman Mao's teachings on considering the overall situation on a hilltop. In the discussion, someone said: "Walking linkup is a political activity, and one must first consider it from a political perspective and not just calculate the distance; one must first see how much each team member's ideology has improved through the Long March and not just temper the feet but not the ideology." Someone else said: "We have formed a fighting collective for a common revolutionary goal and embarked on the Long March together, so we should consider the overall situation, unite, and advance together."

In the afternoon march, Zhang Baozhong noticed that this team member's mood was still not normal, walking with his head down at the back of the team, so he had a private talk with him. It turned out that this team member was eager to hurry because he had personal considerations. He was worried that the Long March would take too long, and he would not be able to quickly return to school to study, affecting his mastery of skills. Zhang Baozhong then gave him warm help, making him realize: Serving the people relies on political ideology, not just skills. The Long March is a rare opportunity to improve ideological awareness, and one should, with the spirit of "seizing the day," transform one's ideology and obtain better tempering. This is much more important than studying skills. This team member's ideology was enlightened, and he then spiritually stood tall and caught up with the team, marching forward with everyone.

On November 11, the Long March team arrived at a reception station in Jixian County, Hebei Province. The reception station had prepared some quilts and blankets for the Long March team. A few team members, upon entering the room, immediately spread the quilts and blankets for themselves. Political instructor Zhang Baozhong immediately organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "selflessly serving the people," pointing out that although the blankets can be spread by anyone, the ideological problem must be solved. The team members who spread the blankets checked themselves for not considering the overall situation first when faced with a matter. Those who did not get the blankets also said: Although they did not spread the blankets, their hearts were not quite comfortable, indicating that they also lacked the spirit of "selflessly serving the people." This study gave the entire team a profound education.

The "Long March Red Guards" continuously grasped the signs, making the team members more aware of the need for ideological transformation. The political atmosphere of the entire Long March team became thicker, and Lei Feng-style good deeds emerged one after another. Everyone competed to carry things for the collective and do things for others. Their own belongings, as long as others needed them, were voluntarily given away. When Zhou Baolin's feet swelled and he could no longer wear his original shoes, Liu Shuanglin gave his new pair of shoes to Zhou Baolin.

The "Long March Red Guards" carried a copy of "The Song of Ou Yanghai" and, when encountering difficulties during the march, Political Instructor Zhang Baozhong, in addition to leading everyone to read Chairman Mao's quotations, also read this novel aloud for everyone. Ou Yanghai's tragic childhood life and his fearless spirit of overcoming all hardships inspired the team members to add strength to their march forward.

The "Long March Red Guards" treated the vast rural areas as a great classroom for revolutionary education. They actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought to the poor and lower-middle peasants while seizing every opportunity to learn from them. For example, when they marched to Xin Taimen Commune in Jinxi, they worked with the commune members to build terraces for a day. In the evening, they invited an old guerrilla fighter to share the heroic deeds of the local people's persistent guerrilla warfare. In the years of war, the revolutionary masses here worked for revolution during the day and took up arms to fight the enemy at night. Some revolutionary masses risked their lives to protect revolutionary cadres. After liberation, the poor and lower-middle peasants, for the construction of socialism, carried out arduous struggles to change the world. All this gave the Long March team members a profound education. They said that the working-class and peasant masses are our true teachers, and to achieve ideological transformation, one must combine with the working-class and peasant masses and absorb rich spiritual nourishment from them.

Doing What the PLA Does

From the day of its establishment, the "Long March Red Guards" decided to learn from the People's Liberation Army. They said: "We joined the Long March team and are soldiers without military uniforms, and we should strictly demand the same high standards from ourselves as the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army." They said: "Learning from the People's Liberation Army means learning thoroughly; whatever the People's Liberation Army does, we do the same." To better learn from the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army, they selected Jin Guoming, who had just demobilized from the army, as the team leader, and Zhang Baozhong, who had just transferred from the army, as the political instructor.

Before departure, everyone brought a sewing kit, mended their socks themselves when they were torn, and patched their clothes themselves when they were torn. They marched in formation, singing loudly. Along the way, they strictly observed the discipline of the masses. Every time they arrived at a place, they drew water and swept the floor for the poor and lower-middle peasants. When one team member accidentally broke an oil lamp belonging to a local peasant, and another team member broke a piece of an old porcelain basin belonging to a local peasant, they compensated on the spot. The peasants did not accept the compensation, so they left a note with money when they left.

During the march, they carried out the "three democracies." Team members openly discussed their opinions on the leadership; everyone jointly formulated activity plans; the comrades in charge of meals reported the meal expenses to everyone every few days and sought their opinions.

They learned from the People's Liberation Army and carried out the "one helps one, one pair of red" activity. The entire team of fourteen people voluntarily paired up into seven mutual help and learning pairs. Both sides often studied Chairman Mao's works together, exchanged learning experiences. They marched together, talked heart to heart, discovered problems, and helped each other in time.

They also rested and summarized regularly, reviewing the learning and work situation of the previous period, organizing evaluations and inspections, and selecting active learners of Chairman Mao's works. Rest and summary became the "refueling station" on the Long March, and every time they rested and summarized, the team members' ideologies improved.

Because the "Long March Red Guards" seriously learned from the People's Liberation Army and emphasized politics in everything, after more than ten days of the Long March, each team member was greatly tempered and improved. Li Wei, the youngest team member at seventeen, was initially not approved by some comrades to join the Long March team due to his mischievousness. Through the Long March, Li Wei, under the help and education of the fighting collective and his learning partner Zhang Baozhong, had a great improvement in awareness and became a hardworking, collective-minded, and disciplined good team member. When the Long March team arrived in Beijing to divide into classes, the comrades elected him as the class leader. Many people said: "Li Wei being elected as the class leader is a joyous event for our team. Li Wei's change is a microcosm of our team's progress."

The actions of the "Long March Red Guards" received praise from many people. Along the way, many locals thumbs up and said: "This Red Guard Long March team is really like a team of the People's Liberation Army!"

In the reception station in the capital, the "Long March Red Guards" once again conducted a review and evaluation, summarized their experiences and lessons, selected outstanding team members, and studied the next step of action. They decided to further learn from the People's Liberation Army and, under the guidance of Chairman Mao, bravely advance on the new revolutionary journey. (Accompanied by a picture)

    保证长征式全程步行串连取得更大收获
    千里征途处处突出毛泽东思想
    锦州“长征红卫军”以解放军为榜样，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，大抓活思想，勇于破私立公，关心集体，遵守三大纪律八项注意，虚心向工农学习，取得良好经验。
    编者按：长征式全程步行串连，是我国无产阶级文化大革命中涌现的新事物，是广大革命师生和红卫兵在毛泽东思想指引下的新创造。怎样把长征式步行串连组织得更好？这是广大革命师生非常关心的问题。
    许多革命师生向本报提出询问：长征前要做些什么准备工作？长征途中，怎样才能有更大的收获？怎样保证善始善终地完成长征？今天本报介绍的锦州铁路司机学校“长征红卫军”的经验，可供准备进行长征式全程步行串连的革命小将们参考。
    他们的经验，归根结底，就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真向解放军学习，处处突出政治。从出发前的准备工作开始，就把活学活用毛主席著作摆在一切活动的首位，使长征的过程，成为用毛泽东思想改造自己灵魂的过程。这样，在他们前进的航程上，就有了明亮的灯塔，有了战胜任何艰难困苦的力量。经过这样长征的锻炼，我们年青的一代，就一定能够顶住和战胜任何的困难和艰险，使自己在革命的大风大浪中成长为坚强的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    本报讯　辽宁省锦州铁路司机学校“长征红卫军”，认真向解放军学习，处处突出政治。他们用毛泽东思想组织长征队伍，把思想准备作为最根本的准备。在征途中，他们大抓活思想，认真执行三大纪律八项注意，发扬三八作风，像解放军战士那样严格要求自己。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗进行长征，使每个队员在思想革命化方面迈出了坚实的一步。
    用毛泽东思想武装长征队伍
    这个长征队在做准备工作的时候，强调要用毛泽东思想武装队员们的头脑。他们认为，千准备，万准备，学习毛泽东思想是最根本的准备。
    开始组织长征队伍的时候，学校里有少数人认为：“有车不坐去走路，是自找苦吃。”报名参加“长征红卫军”的革命师生，针对这个问题，认真学习了毛主席关于共产党员应该经风雨、见世面等教导。经过讨论，大家认为：“自找苦吃”，是自觉革命的表现。要革命，就要有“自找苦吃”的革命精神。有人说：“对艰苦采取的不同态度，是无产阶级和资产阶级两种不同世界观的反映。无产阶级革命战士就要敢于吃苦，乐于吃苦。”有人说：“要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，就需要锻炼无产阶级的革命硬骨头精神。”大家一致表示：要做高山上的劲松，不做温室里的花朵，要坚决响应毛主席的号召，到大风大浪里去锻炼！
    报名参加长征的同学当中，个别人有趁机游山玩水的想法。队里也就这个问题组织了讨论。大家认识到：步行串连，绝不是为了游览名胜，而是为了宣传毛泽东思想，为了熟悉社会，熟悉群众，熟悉阶级斗争。最根本的目的，是要更好地学习和领会毛泽东思想，更好地改造自己的世界观。
    通过这些讨论，长征的意义明确了，徒步行军的决心下定了。接下来，他们就研究如何对待长征途中可能出现的困难。长征途中，可能腿要肿脚要起泡，吃饭、住宿可能不方便，有人也可能生病。诸如此类的问题，他们都估计到了。
    怎么样对待这些问题呢？他们遵循的是毛主席的教导：战略上藐视困难，战术上重视困难。
    他们首先分析了克服困难的有利条件。一是有沿途群众和党政机关的支持，二是有集体的力量，三是有解放军和其他长征队的经验；特别重要的是，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想作指路明灯，就是有天大的困难也能克服。接着，他们学习了毛主席的《愚公移山》。大家认为：这困难，那困难，意志不坚，经不起考验是最大的困难；只要有了革命精神，一切按照毛泽东思想办事，那就什么事情都好办。
    必胜的信心树立起来了，大家又针对长征中的困难研究了具体对策，并且请参加过二万五千里长征的老红军介绍了长征经验。
    他们着重抓的是思想准备，物质准备要不要呢？他们认为，必要的物质准备是不可少的，问题在于用什么指导思想来进行物质准备。开始，有的队员提出要向解放军借军装借雨衣，有的队员要求学校给经济补助。针对这种情况，队里组织大家学习了毛主席关于艰苦奋斗的教导，提出了“思想准备从严，物质准备从简”和“艰苦奋斗搞长征”的口号，本着因陋就简的原则进行了必要的物质准备。
    经过一个星期的学习准备，一支由十四个人组成的队伍，在毛泽东思想指导下组织起来了。
    十月三十日上午八时，“长征红卫军”在锦州烈士陵园宣了誓，告别了前来欢送的革命群众，在《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中踏上了征途。
    把长征当作思想革命化的过程
      “长征红卫军”的战士们认为，长征的过程就是破私立公的过程，就是活学活用毛主席著作，在灵魂深处闹革命，促进思想革命化的过程。在长征途中，人们头脑里的非无产阶级思想，必然会通过各种形式表现出来。要搞好长征，就必须突出政治，善于抓住活思想，用毛泽东思想打好思想仗。
    他们在一千多里的长征途中，把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切活动的首位。出发前，学习毛主席著作，开会前，学习毛主席著作，遇到问题时学习毛主席著作，到达宿营地后学习毛主席著作。
    行军第三天，许多同志脚上起了泡，队伍行进速度越来越慢。有个队员赶路心切，不顾别人一个劲地往前闯。后面同志提出意见，他不接受。他说：“这样慢腾腾地走，什么时候才能到达目的地？”
    这决不是一个简单的走快一点、走慢一点的问题。转业军人、指导员张宝忠同志认为，这里面，有对长征意义的认识问题，有个人和集体的关系问题，可能还有私心杂念问题。这个问题不解决，队员之间会闹不团结，战斗的集体会涣散。
    中午休息的时候，他组织大家在山头上学习《为人民服务》和毛主席关于照顾全局的教导。讨论中，有人说：“步行串连是政治性的活动，首先要从政治上考虑，不能光计算里数；首先要看通过长征，每个队员的思想有多大提高，不能光炼脚板不炼思想。”有人说：“我们为了一个共同的革命目标，结成了一个战斗的集体，一起走上了长征的道路，就应该照顾全局，互相团结，共同前进。”
    下午行军的时候，张宝忠发现这个队员情绪还不正常，低着头在队伍后边走，就找他个别谈心。原来，这个队员急于赶路，确实有着个人的打算。他考虑自己进学校不久，技术还没有学到家，怕长征时间太长了，不能很快回校学习，影响自己掌握技术。张宝忠就对他进行热情的帮助，使他认识到：为人民服务靠的是政治思想，而不仅仅是技术。长征是一个提高思想觉悟的难得的机会，应该以“只争朝夕”的精神改造思想，使自己得到更好的锻炼。这比起学习技术来，要重要得多。这个队员思想通了，就精神抖擞地赶到队伍前列，和大家一起昂首阔步地前进了。
    十一月十一日，长征队来到河北蓟县马伸桥的一个接待站。接待站为长征队准备了一些褥子、毯子。有几个队员一进屋就把褥子、毯子给自己铺下了。指导员张宝忠立即组织大家学习毛主席关于“毫不利己专门利人”的教导，指出毯子虽然那个铺都可以，但是从行动看思想，思想上的问题必须解决。铺了毯子的队员，在会上检查自己不该一事当前，先替自己打算。没有拿到毯子的人有的也说：自己虽然没有铺，心里却不太痛快，这说明自己也缺乏“毫不利己专门利人”的精神。这一次学习，给了全体队员深刻的教育。
      “长征红卫军”不断地抓住苗头，促使队员们增强了改造思想的自觉性。整个长征队政治空气越来越浓，雷锋式的好人好事不断涌现。大家抢着为集体背东西，替别人办事情。自己的东西，只要别人用得着，就主动让出来。周宝林的脚肿了，原来的鞋子穿不上了。刘双林就把自己的一双新鞋拿给周宝林穿。
    “长征红卫军”带着一本《欧阳海之歌》，行军碰到困难的时候，指导员张宝忠除了带领大家读毛主席语录，还为大家朗读这本小说。欧阳海童年的悲惨生活，欧阳海不怕一切艰苦困难的小老虎精神，使队员们增添了奋勇前进的力量。
      “长征红卫军”把广大农村当作革命化教育的大课堂。他们一面积极向贫下中农宣传毛泽东思想，一面利用一切机会向贫下中农学习。例如，行军到锦西新台门公社的时候，他们和社员一起修了一天梯田。晚上，又请老游击队员介绍当地人民坚持游击战争的英雄事迹。在战争的年代里，这里的革命群众，白天为革命闹生产，晚上拿起枪杆打敌人。一些革命群众冒着生命危险，掩护革命干部。在解放以后，贫下中农为了建设社会主义，开展了改天换地的艰苦斗争。这一切，都给了长征队员深刻的教育。他们说，工农群众是我们真正的老师，要实现思想革命化，就要和工农群众相结合，从工农群众身上吸取丰富的精神养料。
        解放军怎么干咱就怎么干
    “长征红卫军”从成立那天起，就下定了向解放军学习的决心。他们说：“我们参加了长征队，就是一个不穿军装的战士，应该处处以解放军战士的标准严格要求自己。”他们说：“向解放军学习，就要学得彻底，解放军怎么干的，咱们就怎么干。”为了更好地学习解放军的光荣传统，他们把今年刚从部队退伍的同学靳国军选作队长，把刚从部队转业的教员张宝忠选作指导员。
    出发前，每人带上针线包，袜子破了自己缝，衣服破了自己补。走起路来，整队行进，歌声嘹亮。一路上，严格遵守群众纪律。每到一个地方，都为贫下中农打水，扫地。有个队员做饭的时候不小心，打了老乡一盏油灯，有个队员把老乡的一个旧磁盆碰掉一块磁，都当场赔偿。群众不收，他们就在离开的时候，写个条子，把钱悄悄留下。
    行军中，开展了“三大民主”。队员对领导有什么意见都摆到桌面上来；大家共同研究制定活动方案；管伙食的同志，每隔几天就向大家汇报伙食开支情况，征求大家的意见。
    他们学习解放军，开展了“一帮一，一对红”的活动。全队十四个人，自愿结合成七个互帮互学的对子。双方经常一起学习毛主席著作，交流学习心得。他们一道行军，一路谈心，发现问题，及时帮助。
    他们还定期休整，总结前一段的学习工作情况，组织评比检查，评选活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子。休整总结成了长征路上的“加油站”，每经一次休整总结，队员们思想上都有所提高。
      “长征红卫军”由于认真向解放军学习，处处突出政治，经过十几天的长征，每个队员都得到很大的锻炼和提高。十七岁的李卫，是全队最小的一个同学。由于他比较调皮，组织长征队的时候，有些同志不同意吸收他参加。通过长征，李卫在这个战斗的集体和帮学对手张宝忠的帮助教育下，觉悟有了很大提高，成了一个能够吃苦耐劳，关心集体，遵守纪律的好队员。长征队到达北京分班的时候，同志们选他当了班长。不少人说：“李卫选上班长，是我们队的一件喜事。李卫的变化，是我们长征队进步的缩影。”
      “长征红卫军”的行动得到许多人的好评。沿途不少群众竖起大拇指说：“这支红卫兵长征队，真像个解放军的样子！”
    在首都接待站里，“长征红卫军”再一次进行了检查评比，总结了经验教训，评出了五好队员，研究了下一步的行动计划。他们决心进一步向解放军学习，沿着毛主席指引的方向，在新的革命征途上奋勇前进。（附图片）
