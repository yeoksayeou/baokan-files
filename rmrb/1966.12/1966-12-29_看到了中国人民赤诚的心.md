The Chinese Yunnan Acrobatic Art Troupe, after performing in a certain location in the liberated area of Laos, returned to their accommodation. They encountered a "Pathet Lao" soldier who had come from the front lines. Upon learning that this soldier had not yet seen the troupe's performance, the performers, despite their fatigue, enthusiastically began to perform for this sole audience member. The soldier, moved, said, "I saw not only your performance but also the sincere hearts of 650 million Chinese people."

    看到了中国人民赤诚的心
    中国云南杂技艺术团，在老挝解放区芒方某地演出后回到住地，遇到一位来自前线的“巴特寮”战士。演员们听到这位战士还没有看过艺术团的演出，就不顾疲劳，热情地为这位唯一的观众表演起来。这位战士感动地说：“我看到的不光是你们的演出，而且看到六亿五千万中国人民赤诚的心。”
