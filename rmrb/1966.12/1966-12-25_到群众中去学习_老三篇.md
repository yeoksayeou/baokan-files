In 1964, our regiment's core group began studying the "Three Articles." Since last year, we have not only emphasized the "Three Articles" in our study content but also frequently gone to the companies with questions, studying with the soldiers and focusing on the word "use," first focusing on transforming our thoughts. We have achieved relatively good results. From practice, we deeply realize that: cadre leaders going to the masses, going to the companies, and studying and applying the "Three Articles" together with the soldiers, focusing on transforming our worldview, is the necessary path to achieving ideological revolutionization.

Go to the Companies, Strengthen Proletarian Sentiments for the "Three Articles"

Comrade Lin Biao said: The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. He also said: "The 'Three Articles' are the easiest to read, but it is not easy to truly practice them." Why couldn't we truly practice the "Three Articles" in the past few years? It is because the fundamental attitude was not resolved. At that time, the members of our regiment's Party Committee did not fully recognize the great ideological brilliance of the "Three Articles," did not understand them deeply, and did not have deep feelings for them. We did not regard the "Three Articles" as a compulsory course for a lifetime of revolution, but only as an introductory course for new comrades; some comrades were satisfied with a superficial understanding, could recite a few aphorisms about serving the people, and could talk about the principles of serving the people, thinking they had understood and could use them, giving themselves a "diploma." Therefore, we lacked a strong desire to study the "Three Articles," studied them unseriously, and used them poorly.

During the summer field training, in the long-distance march, a soldier from the 7th Company, Yang Yingmin, due to excessive sweating, showed signs of exhaustion. The deputy squad leader, Li Qicheng, discovered this and immediately went to take his backpack and gun, but little Yang refused to give them up, saying: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.' Now is the time to temper my revolutionary will. I must persist to the end!" Deputy squad leader Li Qicheng added: "Chairman Mao also teaches us: 'All members of the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other.' Now is the time to test our revolutionary comradeship." One soldier was extremely responsible for the revolutionary cause, and the other was full of enthusiasm for his comrades. This incident deeply moved Deputy Regiment Commander Wang Renxiu, who was marching with them. He immediately let little Yang ride his horse, but little Yang firmly said: "Before we set out, the leader read us 'In Memory of Norman Bethune,' telling us that to 'completely' and 'thoroughly' fight bravely for the people, we must cultivate a spirit of revolutionary hardiness that fears neither hardship nor death in peacetime. If I surrender to difficulties today, I will not be able to stand firm in battle in the future." Under the inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, little Yang persisted until he reached the destination. Such examples are not only found in the 7th Company but also in other companies, moving Deputy Commander Wang Renxiu and giving each of us a profound lesson.

After the field training, the core group members discussed their experiences. Some comrades excitedly said: "We talk about 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serving the people every day, talk about the two 'extremes,' but when faced with actual problems, we often cannot do it. This shows that our proletarian sentiments for the 'Three Articles' are not as deep as the soldiers'. We have only 'graduated' in words, not in thoughts."

Through this study and comparison, we realized: To make our thoughts adapt to the changing new situation, and to ensure that our thoughts of completely and thoroughly serving the people do not change under any circumstances, and our proletarian sentiments for the "Three Articles" do not change, we must go to practice, go to the masses, and forever be the students of the masses. Only in this way can we truly feel the great power of the "Three Articles," arouse the deepest proletarian sentiments for the "Three Articles," and continuously advance, forever preserving revolutionary youthfulness.

Study with Soldiers, Find the Gap Between One's Thoughts and the "Three Articles"

To study the "Three Articles" well, one must first find the gap between one's thoughts and the "Three Articles." This gap cannot be found by sitting in the office; it can only be found in practice and among the masses. This spring, when the higher-level leadership came to our regiment to inspect the situation of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, they found that the transport team had grasped the "Three Articles" and thoroughly transformed their worldview, making it a red revolutionary furnace. The regiment's Party Committee decided that all members should pack their bags and go to the transport team to learn from them. At first, some comrades doubted whether they could learn anything from the transport team, thinking that even if the transport team studied well, it could not be better than our core group. My own understanding was also not clear. To educate myself with facts and persuade everyone, I took the lead. After arriving at the transport team, I lived in the squad, and when the soldiers held study sessions on the "Three Articles," I joined them in exposing my thoughts; when the soldiers went to clean the stables, I followed them; when they went out to pull coal and carry rice for the companies, I helped them load the trucks, carry the coal, and shoulder the sacks. I also took the opportunity to understand their experiences in studying and applying the "Three Articles" while working and chatting with them. Once, I went to feed the horses with the driver Pang Xianzhu and found that one horse had defecated in the manger. I was about to find a shovel to clean it up, but little Pang had already picked it up with his hands. I said, "It's not hygienic to pick it up with your hands; it's better to use a shovel to clean it up!" Little Pang, while picking it up, laughed and said, "It's okay! Picking it up with your hands makes it cleaner, and adding more hay makes the horse love to eat it." These seemingly trivial "small matters" had a great impact on my thoughts. From the different attitudes towards a pile of horse manure, I discovered the soldiers' noble character and also exposed the dirt in my own thoughts.

Later, several leaders from the regiment also concentrated on learning from the transport team. Through the methods of observing (seeing how the soldiers expose their thoughts and fight against the "I"), doing (observing how the soldiers implement the thoughts of completely and thoroughly serving the people in their actions through labor), and talking (discussing experiences and insights with the soldiers), we quickly found the problems in the ideological revolutionization of the Party Committee leadership and individuals. The political director of the regiment, Li Shuke, previously emphasized his low cultural level and poor abilities, and was not content with doing political work. Through learning from the transport team, he realized that the fundamental problem was not his low cultural level but his low ideological awareness; it was not his poor work abilities but his weak sense of political responsibility for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. The transport team had a new soldier this year, Huang Changeng. Although he was not yet 18 years old and had not graduated from primary school, he followed Chairman Mao's instructions in everything, with deep class feelings, and diligently studied Chairman Mao's works. In less than half a year after enlisting, he memorized the main points of the "Three Articles." He learned and applied what he learned, and when the organization appointed him as a driver, he loved the horses as if they were his own; when appointed as a messenger, he became a restless person, taking on any work that benefited the revolution; and he seized every opportunity to lead everyone in learning aphorisms, reading newspapers, and discussing current events. Huang Changeng's actions educated everyone, and Li Shuke was even more moved. He talked with little Huang, who said: "I am from a poor family, and it is the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who saved me from the sea of suffering. Chairman Mao is the great savior of the working people, and Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. If I do not act according to Chairman Mao's teachings for a moment, if I do not propagate Mao Zedong Thought for a day, I feel uneasy in my heart." After listening to little Huang's introduction, Li Shuke excitedly said: "I am also from a poor family, and it is the Party and Chairman Mao who nurtured me. But I have forgotten my roots, am not content with doing political work, and do not want to be a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought. This is forgetting my roots."

Through working and studying with the drivers, we discovered that the comrades in the transport team not only understood the "Three Articles" more deeply than we did but also applied them more thoroughly. Comparing ourselves with the transport team, we found a thousand differences, mainly in the active study and application of the "Three Articles" and the use of the "Three Articles" to transform our worldview. From then on, we often checked, often practiced, often compared, and improved our self-awareness in transforming our thoughts.

Go to the Masses' Struggle Practice, Study to New Heights, Use to New Heights

How to implement the study of the "Three Articles" in transforming our worldview? Our experience is that sitting in the house, closing the door and using it, cannot achieve high standards or practice hard skills. Only by using it in the masses' struggle practice, in the practice of studying and applying it thoroughly, can we practice the skill of "using" it, continuously using it to new heights.

In the past, we also studied the "Three Articles," exposed our thoughts, and carried out ideological struggles. Sometimes the struggles were quite intense, but since they were all conducted indoors, away from the masses' supervision, the result was that after one struggle, we felt pain for a few days, like shaving, and in three to five days, it grew back. Over time, some comrades even developed a sense of complacency, thinking that as old cadres, having some old habits was inevitable. To solve this problem and make the cadre leaders' determination to study and apply the "Three Articles" and transform their worldview truly implemented, we organized everyone to study a passage from Chairman Mao's "Organize" article. Chairman Mao said: "Our Communist Party members must be able to unite with the masses on any issue." "Our Communist Party members should face the wind and rain, see the world; this wind and rain is the great wind and rain of the masses' struggle, and this world is the great world of the masses' struggle." Chairman Mao's teachings made everyone clear that: Not only should we improve our understanding of the "Three Articles" in the practice of the masses' struggle, cultivate our class feelings, and find the gaps, but we should also bring our problems back to practice and use them, using practice to test our "using" skills.

My "old habit" is subjectivity and one-sidedness, not being good at using the "two-line struggle" method when handling problems, and lacking deep proletarian feelings for comrades. Through study and the help of comrades, I realized that this was not a simple problem of method but a reflection of an incomplete transformation of worldview. I went back to the transport team to learn from them. Once, the driver Cao Lizhao forgot to bring spare horseshoes on a trip, and the horseshoe fell off midway, resulting in a five-hour delay. At that time, I thought that little Cao would definitely be criticized when he returned. However, when little Cao returned at eleven-thirty at night, the team leader, Chen Lunmo, not only did not criticize him but also praised him for his spirit of overcoming all difficulties and completing the task. He took full responsibility for the delay, apologizing for his weak sense of preparedness and not conducting a specific inspection before the trip. This incident not only deeply moved little Cao but also had a great educational impact on me. Why did I think it should be criticized, but Chen Lunmo praised it? It turned out that the degree of worldview transformation was different, the class feelings for the soldiers were different, and the application of Mao Zedong Thought was also different. From Chen Lunmo's handling of this incident, we realized: Whether one can master and apply the "Three Articles" depends on whether one has a thorough revolutionary spirit. With a completely and thoroughly responsible revolutionary spirit for the revolution and comrades, one will definitely be able to study to new heights and use to new heights.

Through going to the companies and studying the "Three Articles" with the soldiers, exposing our thoughts, and fighting against the "I," we have a deeper understanding of Comrade Lin Biao's instruction to "study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, especially focusing on the word 'use.'" Our direction of use is clearer, and the effect of use is greatly improved. The more we use, the higher our proletarian awareness; the more we use, the stronger our awareness of emphasizing politics; the more we use, the more vibrant our revolutionary spirit. Everyone generally feels that the companies are the broadest field for us to study and apply the "Three Articles," and the broad masses are the best teachers for us to achieve ideological revolutionization.

    到群众中去学习“老三篇”
    解放军某部　宋子佩
    一九六四年，我们团中心组开始学习“老三篇”。从去年以来，我们不仅在学习内容上突出“老三篇”，而且经常带着问题到连队，跟战士一起学，在用字上狠下功夫，首先在思想改造上狠下功夫，取得了较好的效果。从实践中，我们深深认识到：领导干部到群众中去，到连队去，跟战士一起活学活用“老三篇”，狠抓世界观的改造，这是实现思想革命化的必由之路。
    到连队中去，增强对“老三篇”的无产阶级感情
    林彪同志说：对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是个很重要的问题。又说：“‘老三篇’最容易读，真正做到就不容易了。”我们前几年学了“老三篇”，为什么不能真正做到呢？就是根本态度没有解决。当时，我们团党委领导成员，对“老三篇”的巨大思想光辉认识不足，理解不深，感情不浓。我们不是把“老三篇”看成是一辈子干革命的必修课，而只看成是新同志的入门课；还有的同志满足于字面上的理解，能背诵几条为人民服务的语录，讲一番为人民服务的道理，就认为自己学懂了，会用了，就自己给自己发了“毕业证”。所以这样，还由于思想上有一些包袱，如：认为跟党和毛主席干革命已经二十多年了，出身好，经过大风大浪的考验，阶级立场没有什么问题，历史上没有犯过大错误，世界观的问题已经解决了；认为，只要不犯大的错误，即使思想上有点毛病，也能跟党和毛主席革命到底。由于在思想上是个低标准，所以我们对学习“老三篇”就缺乏强烈的愿望，学得不认真，用得也很不好。
    去年夏季大野营，在长途奔袭中，七连一班战士杨应敏，因为流汗太多，出现虚脱现象，副班长李启钦发现后，立即上去要抢他的背包和枪，但小杨坚决不给，他说：“毛主席教导我们：要‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’现在正是锻炼我的革命意志的时候，我一定要坚持到底！”副班长李启钦接着说：“毛主席也教导我们：‘一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。’现在也正是考验我们革命战士的阶级友爱精神的时候。”一个战士对革命事业极端负责，一个战士对同志满腔热忱。这件事深深地感动了和他们一起行军的副团长王仁修同志，他马上把自己的马让给小杨骑，但小杨坚定地说：“在出发前，首长给我们讲读了《为人民服务》，告诉我们，要作到‘完全’、‘彻底’地为人民而英勇战斗，就要在平时培养一不怕苦、二不怕死的革命硬骨头精神。如果我今天在困难面前屈服，将来在战斗中就不可能过硬。”在毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，小杨一直坚持到达目的地。像这样的事例，不仅七连有，其他连队也有，感动了王仁修同志，也使我们每个同志都受到一次深刻的教育。
    野营后，中心组同志在一起畅谈体会，有的同志激动地说：“我们天天讲‘完全’、‘彻底’为人民服务，讲两个‘极端’，但碰到实际问题往往不能做到。这说明我们对‘老三篇’的阶级感情不如战士深厚。”“我们过去只在嘴上‘毕业’了，在思想上并没有‘毕业’。”
    通过这次学习和回忆对比，使我们认识到：要使自己的思想适应变化了的新形势，不论在任何情况下，都能保证自己完全、彻底为人民服务的思想不变，对待“老三篇”的无产阶级深厚阶级感情不变，就要到实践中去，到群众中去，永远做群众的小学生。只有这样，才能真正体会到“老三篇”的巨大威力，激发起对“老三篇”的最深厚的无产阶级感情，才能不断前进，永葆革命的青春。
    跟战士一起学习，找出自己思想与“老三篇”的差距
    要学好“老三篇”，就要首先找出自己的思想与“老三篇”之间的差距。这种差距，不是坐在办公室里所能找到的；只有到实践中、到群众中，才能找出来。今年春天，上级领导机关来我们团检查活学活用毛主席著作情况时，发现运输队在学习“老三篇”、彻底改造世界观方面，抓得狠，效果好，是一所红色的革命熔炉。团党委作出决定，要求党委所有成员都背上行李，到运输队跟班见学，到这所为人民服务的熔炉里去学习为人民服务。开始，有的同志对于到运输队能不能学到东西，抱怀疑态度，认为运输队学得再好，也不可能比我们中心组学得好。我自己的认识也不是很清楚的。为了用事实教育自己，说服大家，我就先走一步。到了运输队后，我住在班里，战士开学习“老三篇”的讲用会，我就和他们一起亮思想；战士们去打扫马厩，我也跟着去干；他们出车给连队拉煤运米，我也和他们一起去装车、抬煤、扛麻袋。并且利用和他们一起劳动、谈心的机会，了解他们活学活用“老三篇”的经验。有一次，我和驭手庞显祖一起去喂马，发现一匹马把粪拉在马槽子里。我正要找铁锨来铲，小庞已经用手捧了起来。我说：“用手捧不卫生，还是用铁锨来铲吧！”小庞边捧边笑着说：“不怕！用手捧得干净，再添上草，马才爱吃。”这些看来是微不足道的“小事”，但对我的思想却震动极大。从对待一堆马粪的不同态度里，我发现了战士思想品德的高尚，也照出了自己思想中的污垢。
    后来，团里的几位领导同志，也都集中到运输队跟班见学。通过一看（看战士是怎样亮思想斗“我”字）、二干（从劳动中观察战士是怎样把完全、彻底地为人民服务的思想落实到行动上）、三谈（和战士一起谈心得谈体会）的办法，使我们很快地找到了在党委领导班子和个人思想革命化方面所存在的问题。团政治处主任李树科同志，过去强调文化低，能力差，不安心做政治工作。通过到运输队学习，他认识到根本问题不是文化水平低，而是思想觉悟低；不是工作能力差，而是对宣传毛泽东思想的政治责任心不强。运输队有个今年入伍的新战士，叫黄长庚。论年龄，还不满十八岁，论文化，高小还没有毕业，但他处处按照毛主席的指示办事，带着深厚的阶级感情，努力学习毛主席著作，入伍不到半年，就把“老三篇”的主要观点记得清清楚楚。他学了就用，组织上让他当驭手，他爱马如命；让他当通信员，他又成了一个闲不住的人，只要对革命有利，什么工作都抢着干；并抓紧一切机会，领着大家学语录，给大家读报纸、讲时事。黄长庚的行动，教育了大家，李树科同志受感动就更大。他找黄长庚谈，小黄说：“我是个苦孩子出身，是共产党、毛主席把我从苦海里救出来。毛主席是劳动人民的大救星，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，我一时一刻不按毛主席的教导办事，一天不宣传毛泽东思想，我就觉得心里不安。”李树科听了小黄的介绍以后，激动地说：“我也是个苦孩子出身，是党和毛主席把我培养成人。可是我却好了伤疤忘了痛，不安心做政治工作，不想当毛泽东思想的宣传员，这是忘本。”
    通过和驭手一起劳动，一起学习，我们发现运输队的同志不仅对“老三篇”领会得比我们深刻，而且用得也比我们彻底。我们和运输队的同志比较，有千差万差，主要是在活学活用“老三篇”，用“老三篇”改造世界观上差。从此，我们便经常检查，经常实践，经常对照，提高了改造思想的自觉性。
    到群众斗争的实践中去，学出新的水平，用出新的水平
    如何把学习“老三篇”落实到改造世界观上呢？我们的体会是，坐在屋子里，关上门用，是用不出高水平，练不出硬功夫来的。只有到群众斗争的实践中去用，在狠学狠用的实践过程中，才能练出“用”的硬功夫，不断地用出新的水平。
    过去，我们学习“老三篇”，也亮思想，也开展思想斗争，有时斗得还相当激烈，但由于都是关在屋子里斗的，脱离了群众的监督，结果斗一次，痛几天，就像刮胡子一样，过不了三天五日，又冒了出来。久而久之，有的同志甚至滋长了一种麻痹情绪，认为自己是老干部了，有点老毛病是难免的。为了解决这个问题，使领导干部活学活用“老三篇”、改造世界观的决心，真正落到实处，我们组织大家学习了毛主席在《组织起来》一文中的一段话。毛主席说：“我们共产党员，无论在什么问题上，一定要能够同群众相结合。”“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”毛主席的教导，使大家明确了：不仅要在群众斗争的实践中，提高我们对“老三篇”的认识，培养我们的阶级感情，找出差距，而且要带上自己的问题，再回到实践中去用，通过实践来检验我们“用”的硬功夫。
    我的“老毛病”是主观片面，处理问题时不善于使用“两分法”，对待同志缺乏深厚的无产阶级感情。通过学习和同志们的帮助，我认识到这不是一个简单的方法问题，而是世界观改造得不彻底的反映。我就又回到运输队跟班见学。有一次，驭手曹立耀出车时，忘了带备用马掌，途中马掌掉了，结果延误了五个小时。当时我想，小曹回来后，非挨批评不可。但是，小曹深夜十一点半回来时，队长陈伦模同志不仅没有批评，还表扬了他能够排除万难、想方设法完成任务的精神。并把延误时间的责任全部担到自己身上，当面检讨了自己战备观念不强，出车前只作了一般的要求，没有作具体检查。这件事，不仅使小曹极为感动，对我的教育也极大。为什么我认为该批评的，陈伦模却表扬呢？原来，世界观改造的程度不同，对战士的阶级感情不同，对毛泽东思想的运用也就不一样。从陈伦模对这件事的处理中，使我们认识到：能不能把“老三篇”学到手，用到家，关键在于有没有彻底革命的精神。有了对革命、对同志完全、彻底负责的革命精神，就一定能够学出新的水平，用出新的水平。
    通过到连队和战士一起学习“老三篇”，一起亮思想，一起斗“我”字，使我们对林彪同志“活学活用毛主席著作，特别要在‘用’字上狠下功夫”的指示理解得更加深刻了，用的方向更加明确了，用的效果也大大提高了。越用无产阶级的觉悟越高，越用突出政治的自觉性越强，越用革命精神越振作。大家普遍反映，连队是我们活学活用“老三篇”的最广阔的天地，广大群众是我们实现思想革命化的最好的老师。
