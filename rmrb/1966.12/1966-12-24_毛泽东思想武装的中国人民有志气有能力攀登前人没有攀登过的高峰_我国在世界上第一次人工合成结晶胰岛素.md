The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have the spirit and ability to scale peaks never before climbed by their predecessors. Our country has, for the first time in the world, artificially synthesized crystalline insulin.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, scientists have, after more than six years of arduous work, secured this "world championship" in theoretical scientific research for our country. This outstanding achievement marks a significant step forward in humanity's great journey to unravel the mysteries of life, providing a powerful new piece of evidence for the materialist dialectical theory of the origin of life.

Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: After six years and nine months of hard work, Chinese scientists have, for the first time in the world, artificially synthesized a biologically active protein—crystalline insulin. This remarkable scientific experiment signifies that humanity has taken another step forward in understanding life and unraveling its mysteries. The era of artificial protein synthesis has begun. This is a major achievement in theoretical scientific research for our people, accomplished under the Party's leadership and with the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought held high, as part of the great march to scale the world's scientific peaks and catch up with the world's advanced scientific levels.

This research achievement has been scientifically appraised by the appraisal committee organized by the State Science and Technology Commission. The state appraisal committee, in its unanimous appraisal report, pointed out: Based on a comprehensive examination of the design scheme, experimental methods, original data, and logical reasoning of the artificially synthesized insulin, the crystalline product obtained through artificial synthesis is indeed crystalline bovine insulin. This is the first crystalline protein with biological activity to be artificially synthesized in the world, and it is also the largest naturally occurring organic compound with biological activity that has been artificially synthesized to date. The experimental data is detailed and reliable, and the analytical and measurement indicators are complete.

The appraisal committee believes that the research on the artificial synthesis of insulin, starting from a relatively weak foundation in peptide chemistry, has rapidly surpassed the United States and West Germany, achieving a leading position in the world. This research has innovative aspects in the formulation of the research plan, the design of the synthesis route, and the establishment of relevant micro-separation and analysis technologies.

Protein is one of the material bases of life. All living matter cannot do without protein and another important substance—nucleic acid. As early as ninety years ago, Engels pointed out, "Life is the mode of existence of protein bodies." He also predicted: "Once the composition of proteins is understood, chemists will be able to synthesize proteins." However, proteins are numerous and extremely complex, making it difficult to understand them. Over the past thirty years, foreign scientists have conducted long-term explorations in this area, and it was not until 1955 that they clarified the chemical structure of the simplest protein—insulin, discovering that it is composed of a chain of twenty-one different amino acids in the A chain and a chain of thirty different amino acids in the B chain, linked together by two sulfur-sulfur bonds. As for artificially synthesizing insulin, the work is even more complex and enormous. Therefore, as late as 1958, the British journal Nature predicted: "Artificial synthesis of insulin is unlikely to be achieved in the foreseeable future."

However, in 1958, under the inspiration of the Party's general line for socialist construction and the impetus of the nationwide Great Leap Forward, Chinese scientists first proposed the scientific task of artificially synthesizing insulin. The following year, they successfully accomplished the disassembly and reassembly of the A and B peptide chains that constitute natural insulin, finding a correct technical route for the artificial synthesis of insulin. In this scientific research field, China has always been in the lead. In the world, the first to successfully complete the disassembly and reassembly of natural insulin was China; the first to obtain semi-synthetic crystalline insulin was China; and the first to obtain fully synthetic crystalline insulin was also China. In this research work, Chinese scientists have made many new and unique innovations in methods and techniques.

Since September 17, 1965, when China first achieved the full artificial synthesis of insulin, the artificially synthesized product has been produced in fifty-seven batches, each with biological activity. Among these, five batches have been purified to obtain crystals, with the crystal shape and biological activity identical to those of natural insulin crystals. The United States and West Germany have also reported obtaining similar insulin products, but so far, the reported activity is very low, and crystals have never been obtained.

The artificial synthesis of insulin is not only significant in the development of natural sciences but also in philosophy. The origin of life has long been a central issue in the struggle between materialism and idealism. Idealists believe that "life is created by God"; materialists believe that life is the result of the movement, evolution, and development of inorganic matter over billions of years. In 1828, the German scientist Wöhler first artificially synthesized urea, transforming inorganic matter into organic matter, and for the first time in history proved that there is no insurmountable barrier between inorganic and organic matter. This was a leap in human understanding of life phenomena and a major blow to idealism. Now, Chinese scientists have achieved the artificial synthesis of proteins, and this achievement provides a powerful new piece of evidence for the materialist dialectical theory of the origin of life, marking another significant step forward in humanity's long journey to understand the mysteries of life, and another heavy blow to idealism.

China's achievement of artificially synthesizing the protein crystalline insulin for the first time in the world is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for the Party's line for socialist construction.

Throughout this research process, there has been a fierce struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, between two ideologies and two paths. In 1958, when this research topic was first proposed, some bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" considered it "risky," saying, "Even the world's leading scientists dare not attempt it, and you think you can succeed? That's just a pipe dream"; during the research process, they continued to attack, saying it was a "distant" matter; after the results were obtained, some assumed an "authoritative" posture and refused to acknowledge them, while others tried to claim them as their own. However, under the Party's leadership, Chinese scientists followed Chairman Mao's teachings to "break superstitions and liberate thought," and "to do what our predecessors have never done, which is extremely glorious and great." They bravely undertook this research task, determined to bring glory to the nation. They not only regarded this research work as a scientific battle but also as a political battle. During the research process, scientists followed the dialectical materialist philosophical thoughts expounded by Chairman Mao in "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." With no ready-made technical routes for artificial synthesis, they focused on the main contradictions and explored through continuous experiments; they learned what they did not know and created conditions where there were none; at the same time, they combined the spirit of "daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act" with the scientific attitudes of "strictness, seriousness, and meticulousness." It is precisely because of this that Chinese scientists have broken through many "authoritative" judgments and views in a series of scientific problems, achieving unprecedented major successes.

Chairman Mao said: "The people have limitless creative power." "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any human miracle can be created." The research on the artificial synthesis of insulin is based on this brilliant thought of Chairman Mao, breaking through the old traditions and frameworks of past research work, discarding the practice of relying solely on a few experts to walk with one leg in a cold and desolate manner, and firmly adopting the approach of relying on the masses, implementing the three-in-one combination of leadership, masses, and experts, and practicing communist cooperation. More than ten units participated in this research. As many scientists have said, the artificial synthesis of insulin is the crystallization of collective wisdom and the product of the socialist system.

After more than six years of scientific experiments, Chinese scientists have reached a peak in the world of science, securing a "world championship" in science for the motherland. At the same time, this scientific practice has also enabled our country to grow from nothing to a team of scientists engaged in the synthesis of proteins and peptides, and has accumulated rich experience for our country's scientific cause under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought to engage in research work.

    毛泽东思想武装的中国人民有志气有能力攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰
    我国在世界上第一次人工合成结晶胰岛素
    科学工作者在毛泽东思想指导下，经过六年多的艰苦工作，为我国夺得了这项理论科学研究的“世界冠军”。这一杰出的重大成就，标志着人类在揭开生命奥秘的伟大历程中迈进了一大步，为生命起源的唯物辩证学说取得了一项有力的新论据。
    新华社二十三日讯　我国科学工作者经过六年零九个月的艰苦工作，在世界上第一次用人工的方法合成了一种具有生物活力的蛋白质——结晶胰岛素。这一杰出的科学实验，标志着人类在认识生命、揭开生命奥秘的伟大历程中又迈进了一大步，人工合成蛋白质的时代已经开始。这是我国科学工作者在党的领导下，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在奋力攀登世界科学高峰、赶超世界先进科学水平的伟大进军中，为祖国人民在理论科学研究方面取得的一项重大成就。
    这项研究成果，已经由国家科学技术委员会组织的鉴定委员会进行科学鉴定。国家鉴定委员会在一致通过的鉴定书中指出：根据对人工合成胰岛素的设计方案、试验方法、原始数据及逻辑推理等方面的全面检查，人工全合成的结晶产物就是结晶牛胰岛素。这是世界上第一次人工合成的一种具有生物活力的结晶蛋白质，也是迄今为止人工合成的具有生物活力的最大的天然有机化合物。实验数据详细可靠，分析测定指标完整。
    鉴定委员会认为：人工合成胰岛素的研究，是在我国多肽化学原有基础比较薄弱的情况下，迅速超越了美国、西德，而取得了世界领先的地位。这项研究，在研究方案的制定、合成路线的设计、以及有关微量分离分析技术的建立等方面，都有独创之处。
    蛋白质是生命的物质基础之一，凡是有生命的物质都离不开蛋白质和另一重要物质——核酸。早在九十年前，恩格斯就指出，“生命是蛋白体的存在方式”。并且预言：“只要把蛋白质的成分弄清楚以后，化学家就能着手制造出蛋白质来。”但是，蛋白质种类繁多，结构极为复杂，要弄清它很不容易。近三十多年来，国外科学家在这方面做了长期的探索，直到一九五五年才搞清楚了一种最简单的蛋白质——胰岛素的化学结构，发现它是由一条各种不同的氨基酸所组成的二十一肽A链，和一条各种不同的氨基酸所组成的三十肽B链，通过两个硫硫键联结起来的。至于要用人工方法合成胰岛素，则工作量更加繁复浩大，因此，直到一九五八年，英国《自然》杂志还预测：“人工合成胰岛素在相当长的时间内，未必会实现。”
    然而，就在一九五八年，我国科学工作者在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，在全国轰轰烈烈、热火朝天的大跃进形势推动下，首先提出了用人工方法合成胰岛素这一科学课题。第二年，他们就实现了构成天然胰岛素的A、B两条肽链的拆分和重新组合的工作，为人工合成胰岛素找到了一条正确的技术路线。在这一科学研究领域中，在研究工作的各个阶段，我国始终居于领先的地位。在世界上，第一个成功地完成了天然胰岛素拆合工作的，是中国；第一个得到人工半合成结晶胰岛素的，是中国；第一个得到人工全合成结晶胰岛素的，还是中国。在这项研究工作中，我国科学工作者在方法上、技术上有不少新的独特的创造。
    一九六五年九月十七日，我国第一次实现人工全合成胰岛素以来，人工合成的产物先后已经有五十七批，每批都有活力。其中有五批经过提纯，获得结晶，其结晶形状、生物活力都和天然胰岛素结晶相同。美国、西德也曾报道过他们获得类似胰岛素的产物，但是到目前为止，所报道的活力很低，并且从未获得结晶。
    人工合成胰岛素，不仅在自然科学发展方面有重要意义，而且在哲学上也有重要意义。关于生命起源的问题，多少年来一直是唯物主义和唯心主义进行斗争的核心问题之一。唯心主义者认为生命“是上帝创造的”；唯物主义者认为，是没有生命的无机物经过亿万年运动、演化、发展的结果。一八二八年，德国科学家违勒首创人工合成尿素，把无机物变成了有机物，在历史上第一次证明了无机物和有机物之间并没有什么不可逾越的界限。这是人类认识生命现象的一次飞跃，是对唯心论的一次重大打击。现在，我国科学工作者实现了人工合成蛋白质，这一成就使生命起源的唯物辩证学说又取得了一项有力的新论据，人类在认识生命奥秘的长程中又迈进了一大步，这是对唯心论的又一次沉重的打击。
    我国科学工作者在世界上第一次用人工的方法合成蛋白质结晶胰岛素，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是党的建设社会主义总路线的伟大胜利。
    在这项研究的过程中，自始至终贯穿着无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义和资本主义两种思想、两条道路的激烈斗争。一九五八年，当这项研究课题刚刚提出时，有的资产阶级反动学术“权威”就认为这是“冒险”，说“世界权威科学家都不敢搞，你们想要搞成，简直是痴心妄想”；在研究过程中，他们继续攻击说这是“遥远的”事情；在拿到成果以后，有的摆出一副“权威”的架势，拒不承认，有的则企图贪为己有。但是，我国科学工作者在党的领导下，遵循毛主席“破除迷信，解放思想”，“做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”的教导，勇敢地担当起这项研究任务，决心为国争光。他们不仅把这一研究工作当做一场科学仗，而且当做政治仗，在研究工作过程中，科学工作者按毛主席在《实践论》、《矛盾论》中所阐述的辩证唯物主义哲学思想从事研究。没有现成的人工合成的技术路线，他们就抓住主要矛盾，通过不断的实验进行探索；不懂的就学，没有条件就自己动手创造条件；同时在研究工作中把“敢想、敢说、敢干”的精神和“严格、严肃、严密”的科学态度结合起来。正因为如此，我国科学工作者在一系列的科学问题上打破了许多“权威”的论断定见，取得了前人所未有的重大成就。
    毛主席说：“人民群众有无限的创造力。”“在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”人工合成胰岛素的研究就是根据毛主席的这一光辉思想，冲破了过去研究工作的旧传统、旧框框，摈弃了只靠少数专家用一条腿走路冷冷清清的做法，坚决采取依靠群众，实行领导、群众、专家三结合，实行共产主义大协作。参加这一项研究的协作单位就有十多个。正如许多科学工作者所说，人工合成胰岛素是集体智慧的结晶，是社会主义制度的产物。
    六年多科学实验，我国科学工作者登上了一个世界科学的顶峰，为祖国夺得了一项科学的“世界冠军”。同时，这一科学实践，也使我国从无到有地成长起一支从事蛋白质和多肽合成的科学队伍，并为我国科学事业在毛泽东思想指导下，从事研究工作，积累了丰富的经验。
