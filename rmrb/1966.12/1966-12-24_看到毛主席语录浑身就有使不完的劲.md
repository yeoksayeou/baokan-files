Before the repair equipment battle at the Lanzhou Refinery in Gansu, the alkylation workshop asked worker Liu Fuhua to repair the oil injectors of two pumps. Just as he was about to start, a worker came over and said, "Two mechanics have tried to fix it before, and neither could. You probably won't be able to either!" Liu Fuhua heard this and began to wonder, "Can I fix it?"

At that moment, he looked up and saw a red signboard with Chairman Mao's quotations in bright golden letters: "Resolutely fight to the end, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." He suddenly felt full of energy. He softly said, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, at this critical moment, it is you who have given me the greatest encouragement and strength. I will definitely follow your teachings, make up my mind, and fix the oil injector."

Liu Fuhua and worker Wang Genwu worked together for a long time but still couldn't fix it; it was still leaking oil. They began to feel discouraged.

At this moment, another quotation from Chairman Mao caught their eye: "In this world, there is nothing to fear except the words 'seriousness.' The Communist Party is the most serious about these words." Chairman Mao's words shone like a beacon, guiding them. Liu Fuhua thought: Chairman Mao teaches us to be responsible to the people and to be serious in our work. Today, when I am fixing the oil injector, have I been responsible to the people? Have I been serious? So he and Wang Genwu carefully re-examined and thought deeply, and finally, they fixed the oil injector. Liu Fuhua excitedly said, "Seeing Chairman Mao's quotations is like seeing Chairman Mao himself, listening to his kind instructions, and I feel full of endless energy!"

    看到毛主席语录浑身就有使不完的劲
    甘肃兰州炼油厂检修设备大会战前夕，烷基化车间让工人刘富华修理两台泵的注油器。他正要动手去修，一位工人过来对他说：“以前两个钳工专门修理过，都没修好，你恐怕也不行！”刘富华一听，心里也嘀咕开了：“我能修好吗？”
    这时，他抬头看见了厂区红色的毛主席语录牌上几个金光闪闪的大字：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，顿时觉得浑身是劲。他轻轻地说：“毛主席啊，毛主席，在这个节骨眼上，是您给了我最大的鼓舞、最大的力量，我一定遵循您的教导，下定决心，修好注油器。”刘富华和工人王根武一起，修了好一会也没修好，还是漏油。他们感到有些灰心了。
    这时，另一幅毛主席语录映入他们眼中：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”毛主席的话像一盏明灯一样照耀着他们。刘富华想：毛主席教导我们要向人民负责，做事情要认真。我今天修注油器，是不是做到了向人民负责？是不是做到了“认真”二字？于是他和王根武重新认真检查，反复琢磨，最后，终于修好了注油器。刘富华激动地说：“看到毛主席语录，就好像见到了毛主席，听着他老人家的亲切教导，我浑身就有使不完的劲！”
