One morning, there was a train heading to Shenyang, with only an hour left until departure. A truck loaded with goods was speeding towards the station. As soon as the truck stopped, two sweaty soldiers jumped out from the driver's seat. They hurried to the luggage room to handle the consignment procedures. The luggage clerk, seeing a truck full of supplies, asked in surprise, "The train is about to leave, why are you so late?" The two soldiers, wiping the sweat from their faces, replied, "These are Chairman Mao's works. The workers at the printing plant, to ensure that Chairman Mao's books reach the soldiers as soon as possible, worked overtime to print them, and they were just finished and sent here." Upon hearing that it was Chairman Mao's works, the luggage clerk eagerly asked, "How many pieces, and where do they get off the train?" Upon hearing that it was to a small station, the luggage clerk became even more anxious. Because at this station, the train only stops for one minute, and so many books, according to regulations, would need to be unloaded in three batches. "What to do?" the luggage clerk thought, saying, "These are Chairman Mao's books, we should find a way to send them to the soldiers as soon as possible." With that, he rushed into the station.

Soon, the luggage clerk returned, happily telling the two soldiers, "The leadership has decided that this time we will break the old rules, and the train will leave whenever the unloading is finished." The station leadership organized the workers to quickly load the books, and notified the small station to prepare manpower for quick unloading. The workers, to get Chairman Mao's works on the train, ran quickly, and soon moved a truck full of Chairman Mao's works onto the train. The train whistle blew, and it sped off.

The workers at the small station, upon hearing that they needed to unload Chairman Mao's works, were very happy. They had already made all the preparations and were waiting on the platform.

As soon as the train arrived, the workers hurried to unload. Some passengers, upon hearing that they were unloading Chairman Mao's works, also voluntarily participated in this glorious labor. Everyone worked together, and in less than two minutes, they had unloaded all of Chairman Mao's works.

The workers, facing this large pile of Chairman Mao's works, had indescribable joy. Some said, "Our station unloaded so many of Chairman Mao's books, this is the first time. The books may not be for us, but we must let the soldiers read Chairman Mao's books as soon as possible, this is our greatest responsibility." They mobilized all the station workers, family members, and Young Pioneers to quickly send the books to the soldiers. Everyone said, "The soldiers go to the battlefield to fight the enemy relying on Mao Zedong Thought, we transport Chairman Mao's works to the soldiers, this is the best weapon, the greatest support for the soldiers!" Everyone pushed, lifted, carried, and shouldered, and in just two hours, they sent the delivered Chairman Mao's works to the military base.

The selfless love of the railway workers and their families for Chairman Mao's works greatly inspired every cadre and soldier. Everyone expressed their determination to love our great leader Chairman Mao like the railway workers, to love Chairman Mao's works like they do. Everyone resolved to study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, to use Chairman Mao's books as the guiding principles for all work, to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and to truly implement it in action.

    因为这是毛主席的书
    向线
    一天早晨，有一列开往沈阳的火车，离开车时间只有一个小时了。
    一辆满载货物的汽车，朝车站飞奔。汽车刚刚停稳，从驾驶座里跳出两个满脸大汗的解放军战士。他俩急忙跑到行李房，办理托运手续。行李员一看满满一车物资，便吃惊地问道：“快开车了，怎么来这么晚呐？”这两个战士边擦着脸上的汗边说：“这是毛主席著作。印刷厂的工人同志，为了使毛主席的书早点和战士们见面，加班加点赶印出来，刚刚整好就运来了。”行李员听说是运送毛主席著作，急忙问道：“多少件，到哪里下车？”一听说是到一个小车站下车，行李员更加着急了。因为在这个车站，火车只停一分钟，这么多书，按规定要分三次才能运完。“怎么办？”行李员一面想，一面说：“这是毛主席的书，应该想办法早点送到解放军同志们手里。”说完便往车站里跑去。
    不一会，行李员跑回来高兴地对这两个战士说：“领导上决定，这次咱们打破旧框框，什么时候卸完，什么时候开车。”车站领导一面组织职工抢装，一面通知这个小站组织人力准备抢卸。工人们为了把毛主席著作装上火车，飞快地奔跑着，很快把一大汽车毛主席著作搬上了火车。列车长鸣一声，直奔前方。
    这个小站的工人们听说要卸毛主席著作，都感到很高兴，他们早已做好一切准备，在站台等候。
    列车一到站，工人们就赶忙抢卸。有的旅客听说是抢卸毛主席著作，也主动参加了这场光荣的劳动。大家同心协力，不到两分钟，就把毛主席著作全部卸下来了。
    工人们面对着这一大堆毛主席著作，心里有说不出来的高兴。有的说：
  “我们车站卸下这么多毛主席的书，这还是头一回。书虽然不是给我们的，但是，我们要让解放军同志早点读到毛主席的书，这是我们最大的责任。”他们为了尽快把书送到战士们手里，把全站的职工、家属、少先队员都动员起来了，大家都说：“解放军上战场杀敌人靠的是毛泽东思想，我们给解放军运毛主席著作，这就是最好的武器，是对解放军最大的支援！”大家推的推，抬的抬，挑的挑，扛的扛，仅仅用了两个来小时，把运来的毛主席著作送到了部队驻地。
    铁路职工、家属对毛主席著作无比热爱的实际行动，有力地鼓舞着每一个干部、战士。大家纷纷表示，要像铁路工人那样无限热爱我们的伟大领袖毛主席，像他们那样无比热爱毛主席著作。大家决心更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的书当成各项工作的指导方针，真正把毛泽东思想学到手，真正贯彻到行动中去。
