Once, a young boy from Colombia came to Beijing Airport to meet his mother. He held a copy of the Chinese version and an English version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong." Someone asked him why he was carrying two copies. He held up the English version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and said, "This copy of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong' is for my mother. It is the best gift for our reunion." Then, he began to read aloud in the waiting hall in Chinese, "The core of our leadership is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism." His enthusiastic recitation earned him a round of applause from all the passengers.

Another time, one evening, a three-year-old boy from Cambodia also came to the airport to meet someone. Everyone asked him to sing a song, and without hesitation, he began to sing songs from "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," one after another, singing so earnestly and skillfully that he deeply moved everyone present.

    最好的见面礼
    有一次，一位哥伦比亚小朋友来到北京机场接他的妈妈。他手里拿着中文版和英文版的《毛主席语录》各一本。有人问他为什么拿两本语录。他举着英文版《毛主席语录》说：“这本《毛主席语录》我要送给妈妈，这是我和妈妈见面时最好的礼物”。接着，他就在候机厅里用中国话大声朗读了起来：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”他的热情洋溢的朗诵，博得了全体旅客的热烈掌声。
    又有一天晚上，一个三岁的柬埔寨小朋友也到机场接客人。大家请他唱歌，他毫不犹豫地就唱起毛主席语录歌，一首接着一首，唱得那么认真，那么熟练，把在场的人都深深地感动了。
