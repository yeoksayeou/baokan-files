The spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense has issued the strongest protest and most serious warning against the latest bloody crime committed by U.S. imperialist military aircraft, which recently bombed Chinese fishing boats in international waters, killing and injuring numerous fishermen.

The New China News Agency reported on December 5 that U.S. imperialist military aircraft recently brazenly bombed Chinese fishing boats in international waters, killing and injuring many fishermen. The spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense strongly protests and seriously warns against this new bloody crime by U.S. imperialism.

On November 30, a total of 41 fishing boats from Haikang and Suixi counties in Guangdong Province were peacefully operating in the western waters of the Beibu Gulf. At 14:45 that day, two U.S. military aircraft suddenly flew over the fishing boats' operating area, circled around, and then dropped 20 bombs. Five Chinese fishing boats were sunk, 14 fishermen were killed, and 20 were injured. On December 1 at 17:00, two U.S. military aircraft again bombed the fishing boats from Haikang County operating in the western international waters of the Beibu Gulf, dropping 8 bombs. One Chinese fishing boat was sunk, three fishermen were killed, and nine were injured.

The spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense pointed out: The U.S. imperialist military aircraft have once again brazenly sunk Chinese fishing boats in international waters, killing and injuring 46 Chinese fishermen. This is not an isolated incident but a serious step in the U.S. imperialists' mad war provocations against our country. This year, while expanding its aggression in Vietnam, the U.S. imperialists, despite repeated serious warnings from the Chinese government and people, have repeatedly dispatched bandit aircraft to bomb, strafe, and threaten Chinese fishing boats and merchant ships, causing significant losses to the lives and property of the Chinese people. We once again seriously warn the U.S. aggressors: Your pirate actions must immediately stop. The account you owe, we will definitely settle. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with. If U.S. imperialism dares to impose war on the Chinese people, the 700 million Chinese people under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao will definitely break the aggressors' backs and thoroughly, completely, and utterly annihilate them.

    我国防部发言人最强烈抗议美机炸沉我渔船炸死炸伤我渔民
    如果美帝胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上
    七亿中国人民就一定要打断侵略者的脊骨
    新华社五日讯　美帝国主义军用飞机最近又公然在公海上轰炸我渔船，炸死炸伤我渔民多人。我国防部发言人对美帝国主义这一新的血腥罪行，提出最强烈抗议和最严重警告。　
    十一月三十日，我广东省海康、遂溪等县共四十一艘渔船，在北部湾西部海域进行和平作业。当日十四时四十五分，美国军用飞机两架，突然飞临我渔船作业区上空，盘旋后，投弹二十枚，炸沉我渔船五艘，炸死我渔民十四人，炸伤二十人。十二月一日十七时，美国军用飞机两架又对我海康县在北部湾西部公海作业的渔船进行轰炸，投弹八枚，炸沉我渔船一艘，炸死我渔民三人，炸伤九人。
    我国防部发言人指出：美帝国主义军用飞机又连续两次悍然在公海上炸沉我渔船，炸死炸伤我渔民四十六人，这绝不是一个孤立的事件，这是美帝国主义对我国疯狂进行战争挑衅的又一严重步骤。今年以来，美帝国主义在扩大侵略越南战争的同时，不顾中国政府和中国人民的多次严重警告，一次又一次派遣强盗飞机对我国渔船、商船进行轰炸扫射和威胁挑衅，使我国人民的生命财产受到重大损失。我们再次严重警告美国侵略者，你们这种海盗行为，必须立即停止。你们欠下的这笔账我们是一定要清算的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不好惹的，如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，在伟大领袖毛主席领导下的七亿中国人民，就一定要打断侵略者的脊骨，把它们坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭掉。
