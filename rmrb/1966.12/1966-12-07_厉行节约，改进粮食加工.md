This year, the grain production situation is very good. Under these circumstances, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and do a good job of saving grain.

Currently, there is a lot of potential in grain processing in rural areas of our region. Generally, the milling rate of 100 jin of paddy rice is only 65-66 jin, which is 6-7 jin less than the national standard second-grade rice that yields 72 jin per 100 jin. If we calculate based on each person using 500 jin of paddy rice per year, this would result in 30-40 jin less rice consumed. For such a large country as ours, if each person can save 30-40 jin of grain per year, it would add up to a significant amount.

Therefore, we suggest that both the grain processing plants of the grain departments and the processing plants of the people's communes' production teams actively improve their processing techniques and promote the production of second-grade rice. We must strictly follow Chairman Mao's instructions and take the issue of saving grain very seriously.

    厉行节约，改进粮食加工
    今年粮食生产形势大好。在这种情况下，我们一定要按照毛主席的指示办事，切实做好节约粮食的工作。
    现在我们地区农村加工粮食有很大潜力，一般每百斤稻谷出米率只有六十五六斤，跟国家供应的标二米每百斤出米七十二斤相比，要少出米六七斤。按一年每人用粮五百斤稻谷计算，就要少吃三四十斤。我们这样一个大国家，如果每年每人能节约三四十斤粮食，加起来就是很大的数字。
    因此，我们建议，粮食部门的加工厂和人民公社生产队的加工厂，都来积极改进加工工艺，提倡加工标二米，切实按照毛主席的指示办事，把节约粮食问题，抓得很紧很紧。
