According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 29th, the revolutionary masses of the capital, along with revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country who have marched to Beijing, today celebrated with great joy the news of our country's successful nuclear test, celebrating the new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and celebrating the fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the early morning, after the victory news was broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station, the capital immediately became lively. People carried portraits of Chairman Mao, held up red flags, and waved copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," jumping and singing as they poured out from schools and factories, from offices and military barracks, all rushing to the reception stations of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council to report the good news.

The cheers echoed throughout the night sky of the capital. A marching team from Heilongjiang Province danced the Northeast folk dance in front of the reception station to express their joy. Members of a marching team from the Shandong Peninsula came to the reception station, bringing a red banner with the words "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life" to offer to Chairman Mao.

In various schools in the capital, many revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards stayed up all night writing new poems, composing new songs, rehearsing performance items, printing reports of joy, and soon the campus was filled with eye-catching big red reports of joy and a festive atmosphere. Red Guards from Peking University and Beijing Normal University believed that this new nuclear test is the salute of the year-end and the New Year, a salute to celebrate the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Revolutionary comrades from Tsinghua University and Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics excitedly pointed out that this nuclear test was conducted during the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, which is a heavy blow to the imperialists, modern revisionists, and all reactionaries who maliciously attack our Cultural Revolution.
