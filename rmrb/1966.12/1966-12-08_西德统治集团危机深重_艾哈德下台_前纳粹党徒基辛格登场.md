The West German ruling class, mired in a government crisis, has finally reached a political deal after intense internal struggles and negotiations: the Adenauer government has stepped down, and a new coalition government led by former Nazi party member Kissinger has taken the stage.

This government crisis, which has worsened over the past few months, is essentially the most severe political crisis the West German ruling class has faced since the establishment of the country. It is an inevitable result of the further development of the overall political and economic crisis in the capitalist world, and the unprecedented intensification of various internal and external contradictions in capitalist countries.

Since taking over from the Adenauer government in 1963, the Adenauer government has consistently followed the United States in its foreign policy, attempting to secure American support for its militaristic and expansionist ambitions, particularly in seeking American support to annex the German Democratic Republic and to acquire nuclear weapons. While supporting the Adenauer government, the United States, in its political dealings with the Soviet revisionist clique, advocates maintaining the status quo in Europe and shifting its strategic focus eastward, which cannot fully satisfy West Germany's aforementioned desires. This has left a significant portion of the West German ruling class extremely dissatisfied. Meanwhile, as Franco-American tensions have sharply escalated, the Adenauer government's pro-American policy has strained West Germany's relations with France, rendering the cooperation alliance treaty between the two countries almost worthless. In this context, disputes within the West German ruling class over foreign policy have become increasingly intense.

Domestically, the Adenauer government has also faced significant challenges, with the economic situation deteriorating. To shift the financial and economic burdens, the Adenauer government has implemented a series of measures targeting the working people, sparking widespread public discontent. The ruling class has also been plagued by internal strife due to the numerous difficulties it faces.

This worsening internal and external predicament ultimately led to the Free Democratic Party withdrawing from the coalition government in late October, forcing Adenauer to step down.

However, the new Kissinger government's situation will be no better than its predecessor. This government is both a product of the temporary compromise among various factions of the West German ruling class, which is now surrounded on all sides, and a stage for more intense future struggles among these factions.

People here point out that the composition of the Kissinger government itself reveals the irreconcilable internal contradictions within the ruling class and the dead-end policies both domestically and internationally.

Chairman Mao said, "The contradictions within the imperialist system are numerous and insurmountable, plunging the imperialists into great distress."

### 西德统治集团危机深重  艾哈德下台　前纳粹党徒基辛格登场

    西德统治集团危机深重
    艾哈德下台　前纳粹党徒基辛格登场
    据新华社波恩电　本社记者报道：深陷在政府危机之中的西德统治集团，经过内部的勾心斗角和讨价还价之后，终于由主要执政党基督教民主联盟—基督教社会联盟同十多年来一直是反对党的社会民主党达成政治交易：艾哈德政府一日宣告下台，由前纳粹党徒基辛格领导的新的联合政府粉墨登场。
    几个月来恶性发展的这次政府危机实质上是西德统治集团自从立国以来最严重的政治危机。这是资本主义世界政治经济总危机进一步发展、资本主义国家各种内外矛盾空前激化的必然结果。
    艾哈德政府在一九六三年接替阿登纳政府上台执政以来，在外交政策上一直紧紧追随美国，企图换取美国的支持去实现军国主义和扩张主义的野心，特别是要求美国支持它并吞德意志民主共和国和染指核武器。美国在支持艾哈德政府的同时，由于要同苏联修正主义集团大搞政治交易而主张在欧洲维持现状，实行战略重点东移，而不能完全满足西德的上述愿望。这使西德统治集团中相当多的人非常不满。同时，随着美法矛盾的急遽尖锐化，艾哈德政府的亲美政策已经使得西德同法国的关系越闹越僵，两国的合作同盟条约几乎成了一张废纸。在这种情况下，西德统治集团内部围绕外交政策路线展开的争吵越来越激烈。
    在内政问题上，艾哈德政府的日子也很不好过，经济状况越来越糟。为转嫁财政经济困难，艾哈德政府采取了向劳动人民开刀的一系列措施，激起了广大人民的强烈不满。统治集团内部也因为困难重重而吵作一团。
    这种内外交困局面的不断恶化终于导致了自由民主党在十月底退出联合政府，艾哈德也就不得不下台。
    但是，新上台的基辛格政府的处境绝不会比它的前任美妙。这个政府既是处在四面楚歌的窘境之中的西德统治集团各派势力暂时妥协的产物，也是这些势力今后进行更激烈的斗争的场所。
    这里的人们指出，基辛格政府班子，本身就表明统治集团内部矛盾的无法调和以及内外政策的走投无路。
    毛主席说：“帝国主义制度内部的矛盾重重，无法克服，使帝国主义者陷入了极大的苦闷中。”
