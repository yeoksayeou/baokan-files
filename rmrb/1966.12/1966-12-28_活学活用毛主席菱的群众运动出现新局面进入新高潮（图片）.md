Now, in our great motherland, a new era is emerging where workers, peasants, and soldiers master Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an endless force, a spiritual atomic bomb of boundless power.

	Lin Biao

	Under the great nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, selfless communists are growing and emerging in large numbers within the People's Liberation Army. Comrade Duang Xisheng of the artillery unit of the Nanjing Military Region has worked hard to memorize the "Three Articles" word for word and sentence by sentence, and put them into practice. When the revolution needs him to be a livestock keeper, he devotes himself wholeheartedly to this task; when the revolution requires him to be the deputy squad leader of the kitchen, in addition to actively doing his job, he still cares about the livestock work as before. This is what Comrade Duang Xisheng shared at a study session about his experience in studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune."

	The militia company of Zao Yuan, born in the presence of Chairman Mao, is vigorously promoting the study of the "Three Articles" to advance the revolutionization of thought. They use the cave where Mao Zedong lived and the platform where he delivered the speech "In Memory of Norman Bethune" as good classrooms to study the "Three Articles." They often use the "Three Articles" as a mirror to reflect on their thoughts, fight against selfishness, and establish a revolutionary worldview of serving the revolution by working the land and serving the revolution by being a soldier.

	"'The Three Articles' are studied and applied every day, forever loyal to Mao Zedong." The workers of various ethnic groups in the Xinjiang October Tractor Factory have an unlimited love for Chairman Mao and an unlimited love for the "Three Articles." They treat the study and application of the "Three Articles" as the top priority, using them to guide their thoughts and actions. This is the workers of the engine workshop discussing their insights from studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune."

	Revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country have traveled long distances to Mao Zedong's revolutionary holy land of Yan'an. The young revolutionaries, with boundless revolutionary passion for our most beloved and respected great leader Mao Zedong, study and apply the "Three Articles" with the poor and lower-middle peasants of Yan'an. They strive to change their thoughts and carry out a revolution in their souls, truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought.

	The family of Zhang Lanxian, a member of Xiaolvzhu Commune in Julu County, Hebei Province (second from the left), has undergone a great change in their spiritual outlook after studying the "Three Articles." The whole family has made plans to do good deeds and takes the lead in collective production, being praised by the masses as a "Red Family." This is Zhang Lanxian's family studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune."

	Studying and applying the "Three Articles" transforms people, land, and mountains and rivers. The broad masses of Meng County, Shanxi Province, have launched a movement to build Dazhai-style fields by studying and applying the "Three Articles." They braved the cold to cut through mountains to create fields, completing more than twenty thousand mu of Dazhai-style fields in just one month. This is the community members of Baizhang Brigade, Shangcun Commune, building terraced fields.

	Chairman Mao said: "All members of the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other." The broad masses of rural people's communes act according to the great leader's teachings, creating a new atmosphere of unity and friendship in the countryside. The community members of the first team of Shuguang Brigade, Fengcheng County, Liaoning Province, saw that the progress of the third team's project was slow while working on the irrigation canal. They then sent part of their strong labor force to support them. This is the first team's community members being warmly welcomed back by the third team's community members after completing their task.

	The primary school students of Wutang Brigade, Chunhuashan Commune, Changsha County, Hunan Province, organized themselves to study and apply the "Three Articles" with high revolutionary enthusiasm. They learn a sentence and apply a sentence, often actively doing good deeds for the production team, and always maintaining collective interests. This is the students studying Chairman Mao's books under the kerosene lamp.

    活学活用毛主席菱的群众运动出现新局面进入新高潮
    现在我们伟大的祖国，正在出现一个工农兵掌握马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的新时代。毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。
    林彪
    在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，一心为公的共产主义新人，正在人民解放军大量成长和涌现出来。南京部队炮兵某部端礼时同志，下苦功夫把“老三篇”一字、一句刻在脑子里，落实到行动上。革命需要他作饲养员，他就全心全意做好这项工作；革命需要他担任炊事班副班长，他除积极做好本职工作外，还和往常一样关心饲养工作。这是端礼时同志在讲用会上谈学习《为人民服务》的体会。
    在毛主席身边诞生的延安枣园民兵连，狠抓学习“老三篇”，努力促进思想革命化。他们把毛主席住过的窑洞和发表《为人民服务》的讲话台，当作学习“老三篇”的好课堂，经常在这里以“老三篇”为镜子，亮思想，斗“我”字，树立胸怀祖国、放眼世界，为革命种地、为革命当兵的革命人生观。“
    ‘老三篇’天天学，天天用，永远忠于毛泽东。”新疆十月拖拉机厂各族职工无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱“老三篇”，他们把活学活用“老三篇”当作头等大事，用以统帅自己的思想和行动。这是发动机车间的各族工人在交谈学习《为人民服务》的心得体会。
    五湖四海的革命师生和红卫兵，长途跋涉，来到毛主席亲手抚育的革命圣地延安。革命小将怀着对我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的革命激情，和延安贫下中农一起活学活用“老三篇”，努力改造思想，在灵魂深处闹革命，真正把毛泽东思想学到手。
    河北省巨鹿县小吕砦公社社员张兰贤（左二）一家学了“老三篇”，精神面貌大变样。全家人订出做好事的计划，在集体生产中处处起带头作用，被群众评为“全家红”。这是张兰贤全家学习《为人民服务》。
    活学活用“老三篇”，人变、地变、山河变。山西省盂县广大社员活学活用“老三篇”，掀起了修建大寨田的热潮。他们冒着严寒，劈山造田，一个月就建成两万多亩大寨田。这是上社公社白藏大队的社员在修建水平梯田。
    毛主席说：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”农村人民公社的广大社员按照伟大领袖的这一教导办事，使农村出现了团结友爱的新风尚。辽宁省凤城县曙光大队一小队的社员在修水渠时，看到三小队的工程进度慢，便抽出一部分强劳力去支援。这是一小队社员在完成任务归队时，受到三小队社员的热情欢送。
    湖南省长沙县春华山公社武塘大队的小学生怀着高度的革命热情，组织起来活学活用“老三篇”。他们学一句，用一句，经常主动地为生产队做好事，处处维护集体利益。这是小学生们在煤油灯下认真读毛主席的书。
