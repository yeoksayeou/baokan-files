    To beg for American food and divert public attention, the Indian reactionaries have again launched a wave of anti-China slanders.

    According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 2nd, the Indian reactionary government, in order to beg for American food and divert public attention, has recently launched another wave of anti-China slanders.

    Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi recently repeated the same old lies in parliament, claiming that China poses a "threat" and "danger" to India. She slandered China's nuclear tests, which were conducted to oppose U.S.-Soviet collusion in nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail and to defend world peace, as posing a "serious danger" not only to India but to the entire Asian continent and indeed the whole world.

    Indian new Foreign Minister Chagla, since taking office on November 13th, has repeatedly made anti-China slanders in parliament. This notorious pro-American figure shouted that China is "continuing to invade India" and that China is "illegally occupying a large amount of Indian territory." He also slandered that "China has invaded Bhutan" and "disrupted India-Bhutan relations." He openly told parliament that the Indian government will take "all necessary measures" to "defend" Bhutan's sovereignty. This clearly exposes the Indian reactionary government's expansionist nature. Chagla also attacked the Chinese border defense troops stationed on the China-Sikkim border for broadcasting on Chinese territory.

    为了乞求美国粮食和转移人民视线
    印度反动派又发出一阵反华叫嚣
    据新华社二日讯　新德里消息：印度反动政府，为了乞求美国粮食和转移人民视线，最近又发出一阵反华叫嚣。
    印度总理英迪拉·甘地最近在议会中一再重复污蔑中国的陈词滥调，说什么中国对印度构成了“威胁”和“危险”。她把中国为了反对美苏勾结实行核垄断和核讹诈、保卫世界和平而进行的核试验，污蔑为“不仅对我们
  （指印度）而且对整个亚洲、实际上是对全世界形成了严重危险”。
    印度新任外交部长查格拉在十一月十三日上台以来，就一再在议会里发出反华叫嚣。这个臭名远扬的亲美分子大叫大喊地说什么中国在“继续侵略印度”，“中国非法占领着大量印度土地”。他还污蔑“中国入侵不丹”，“破坏印度和不丹的关系”。他还公然向议会说什么：印度政府将采取“一切必要措施”来“保卫”不丹主权。这就清楚地暴露出印度反动政府的扩张主义者的本来面目。查格拉还攻击驻守在中国—锡金边境的中国边防部队在中国领土内进行广播。
