Editor's Note: We are very excited to see that on the frontline of China's transportation industry, a hero like Mai Xiande has emerged.

Comrade Liu Zhichun, the heroic driver, is a stalwart proletarian fostered by the great thoughts of Mao Zedong. In the desolate mountains of Qinling, amidst raging storms and harsh weather, Liu Zhichun, despite being severely injured, drove his beloved Liberation truck to safety with extraordinary determination. As mentioned in the report, the driving force of this truck was not the internal combustion engine, but the invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong and his boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Liu Zhichun's glorious deeds once again tell us: the key to achieving ideological transformation is to make Mao Zedong's thoughts our soul. To cultivate new people of communism, we must cultivate those with a thorough proletarian worldview, those who thoroughly transform their souls with Mao Zedong's thoughts. Only by deeply imprinting Mao Zedong's thoughts in our minds, dissolving them in our blood, and putting them into action, can we truly achieve the ideals of not seeking fame or wealth, not fearing hardship or death, dedicating ourselves to the revolution, and serving the people wholeheartedly. In the struggle for socialism and communism, we can radiate boundless light and heat.

The great era of Mao Zedong is an era of heroes. Liu Zhichun, a driver from the Weinan Central Station of the Guanzhong Automobile Transport Company in Shaanxi Province, in the treacherous Qinling mountain area, in the face of a sudden storm, risked his life to save a truck that was about to slide into a ravine. Despite being severely injured, he continued to fight and drove the truck to a safe location, composing another triumphant song of communism with the great thoughts of Mao Zedong.

As long as there is a breath of life, the truck must be driven out.

In the summer of 1965, Liu Zhichun's team was assigned an important task to support national construction by transporting a batch of timber along a treacherous mountain road in the Qinling area.

On July 7, the seventh day of the team's mountain journey, Liu Zhichun drove his beloved Liberation truck up steep slopes and reached the peak of Tudi Ling. Suddenly, the sky darkened, and a storm was about to hit. The terrain was treacherous, the road narrow, with no villages ahead and no shops behind. What should he do? Liu Zhichun thought: the Volunteer Army heroes could deliver military supplies to the frontline under heavy gunfire. Could he retreat in the face of such a small difficulty? No, he must follow Chairman Mao's words, press on bravely, and continue the fight. He focused intently on driving the truck through the muddy road, against the wind and rain. At this moment, he recalled Chairman Mao's teaching: "Strategically, we must despise all enemies; tactically, we must take all enemies seriously." To ensure safe driving in adverse conditions, Liu Zhichun chose a gentle slope, stopped the truck, and prepared to check the brake system.

The truck's rear wheels were stuck in the mud, and the chassis was very close to the ground. Liu Zhichun almost had to lie flat on the ground to crawl to the rear of the truck. He started to tighten the brake screws on the rear wheels. Suddenly, due to the strong wind and the brake's back pressure, the truck began to slide down the slope. Not far below was a ravine, and the truck was in imminent danger of rolling over. In this critical moment, Liu Zhichun, who always put the people's interests above his own, had only one thought: the truck must not roll over. Chairman Mao's teaching, "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai," gave Liu Zhichun boundless strength. Without hesitation, he risked his life, braced himself against the truck's rear axle with his shoulder. The truck continued to slide down, pushing Liu Zhichun along with it. He struggled to brace the axle while quickly and cleverly tightening the brake screws, finally stopping the truck halfway down the slope.

A major accident was averted by the heroic driver armed with Mao Zedong's thoughts. However, our hero was severely injured. Liu Zhichun's head was crushed between the truck's rear wheel and the broken road surface, tearing off and flipping over a third of his scalp from the right side of his forehead to the back of his head, exposing his skull and damaging the bone membrane. One ear was torn off, and the other was ripped into three pieces. His shoulders, arms, and legs were also injured.

Liu Zhichun crawled out from under the truck, feeling numbness and dizziness in his head. He looked around and saw the raging wind and pouring rain, feeling intense pain throughout his body. Liu Zhichun thought: if a landslide or flood occurs, the truck is still in danger of being destroyed. As long as he had a breath of life, he must drive the truck to a safe place and hand it over to the people intact! Even if he sacrificed himself, the truck must continue to serve socialism! With this thought, his spirit soared, and his fighting spirit surged. He tore off his shirt to roughly bandage his torn scalp, enduring the intense pain to crawl back into the driver's seat. At this moment, he saw the words of Chairman Mao on the dashboard: "Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Chairman Mao's teachings gave him boundless strength. Instantly, Liu Zhichun felt full of energy. He used his toes to press the accelerator and his heels to lightly press the brake pedal, thinking: if he fainted or died while driving, his body would lean back, and his legs would press the brake, ensuring the truck would be saved even if he died. This is the great spirit of our hero, firmly defending the people's interests in the face of death.

In the depths of the Qinling mountains, this Liberation truck advanced through the storm. The driving force of this truck was not the internal combustion engine but the invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong. Blood soaked Liu Zhichun's bandaged head, dripping onto his arms and the steering wheel... However, this Mai Xiande-like hero, with his unyielding loyalty to the Party and Chairman Mao, overcame all difficulties. He gritted his teeth, his eyes fixed on the road ahead, driving the truck through eight sharp turns, crossing two rivers, climbing six hills, and covering a distance of more than four miles to reach the Dongping Production Brigade.

An elderly traditional Chinese medicine doctor at the Dongping Production Brigade's clinic, without the aid of anesthesia, cleaned Liu Zhichun's wounds and bandaged them. The intense pain made Liu Zhichun's face covered in beads of sweat. However, even in this condition, Liu Zhichun's thoughts were not on himself. He noticed the doctor's unease and said, "Grandpa, don't be afraid, I'm not in pain, just treat me as you see fit." The elderly doctor, with white hair and beard, was so moved that he could not speak, tears welling up in his eyes as he nodded and bandaged Liu Zhichun's wounds. After the bandaging, Liu Zhichun fainted.

On the morning of July 8, Liu Zhichun was sent to the Weinan District Hospital. At this time, due to excessive blood loss, his life was in danger. But even in his delirium, he kept repeating, "The truck... my truck..."

In the operating room, the doctors and nurses, with tears in their eyes, cleaned the dirt and debris from the hero's wounds and performed the suturing surgery. During the more than eight-hour operation, Liu Zhichun did not utter a sound. His indomitable spirit moved all the medical staff. An old military doctor who had transferred to civilian life was deeply moved and said, "This is not an ordinary patient; he is just like the tough soldiers we used to treat from the battlefield!"

After the surgery, when the director of the Weinan Central Station of the Guanzhong Automobile Transport Company came to visit Liu Zhichun, he was still unconscious. When the nurse informed him, the delirious Liu Zhichun immediately raised an empty hand from the bed and said, "Director, this is the key to my truck... I did not complete the task... My truck needs a second maintenance in two days." His selfless revolutionary spirit deeply moved everyone's heart.

Mao Zedong Thought is the steering wheel of politics.

Liu Zhichun's severed ear, after being reattached, remained bluish and purplish. The doctors and nurses hoped his ear would heal quickly, but eventually, the medical staff believed there was a high possibility of necrosis and decided to gradually inform him of the situation to prepare him mentally. Unexpectedly, Liu Zhichun laughed heartily when he heard the news and said, "What's the big deal if I lose an ear? As long as I can listen to the radio and hear Chairman Mao's voice, it's fine!" After a pause, he added, "Even if I can't hear anymore, I still have two eyes and two hands, and I can still serve the people!"

Liu Zhichun's wounds had not yet healed when he secretly got out of bed to read Chairman Mao's books and quotes to his roommates. He was soon elected as the leader of the external surgery ward's study group for Chairman Mao's works.

Liu Zhichun, while studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with the patients, voluntarily followed Chairman Mao's teachings to enthusiastically serve the patients by bringing them water, delivering meals, and emptying their bedpans. There was an elderly poor peasant, Si Chengyi, in the same ward who had undergone surgery for intestinal perforation. The people's commune sent a member to take care of him, but Liu Zhichun persuaded the member to return and took over the care himself. Every day, he fed Si Chengyi medicine and food, carried him to the toilet, and often recited Chairman Mao's quotes to him, taking care of him for nearly twenty days. When Si Chengyi was discharged, he tearfully held Liu Zhichun's hands and said, "Zhichun, I have never seen anyone as good as you in my life." Liu Zhichun replied, "I didn't know how to serve the people before I studied Chairman Mao's books; it is Chairman Mao who taught me to serve the people. You should thank Chairman Mao."

While recovering in the hospital, Liu Zhichun once saw the hospital's ambulance driver, Liu Cunfu, repairing parts and went to help. During their conversation, he asked Liu Cunfu, "How is your study of Chairman Mao's works?" Liu Cunfu replied, "You know, we drivers are always on the road, so we don't study well." Liu Zhichun said, "We drivers rely on the steering wheel, and Chairman Mao's works are our political and ideological steering wheel. Only by mastering the political and ideological steering wheel can we master the car's steering wheel and drive well." Liu Zhichun's words greatly inspired Liu Cunfu, who decided to learn from Liu Zhichun. Now, Liu Cunfu has become an active learner of Chairman Mao's works among the hospital staff.

After more than a month, Liu Zhichun's condition improved significantly, although his wounds had not yet fully healed, he insisted on being discharged. After his persistent requests for seven or eight times, the hospital finally approved his discharge. Liu Zhichun returned to the automobile station, hid his condition from the leadership, and quickly went back to work.

Follow Chairman Mao's words and be a pure person.

Liu Zhichun was born in an impoverished family in the Tie Lu People's Commune, Lintong County, Shaanxi Province. From a young age, his parents often told him about the family's tragic experiences in the old society: his father was imprisoned for not paying rent, his mother was beaten for not paying the conscription fee, his elder brother wandered to avoid conscription, and two younger brothers starved or died of illness. By 1949, when the nation was liberated, he was overjoyed. However, at that time, he was still an apprentice in a private pharmacy in another county, suffering under the capitalist's oppression. All these experiences deeply planted the seeds of class hatred in Liu Zhichun's young heart.

In 1951, he could no longer bear the capitalist's oppression. At the age of sixteen, he repeatedly requested to join the glorious People's Liberation Army. After enlisting, in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought in the army, Liu Zhichun underwent nearly seven years of training and gradually grew into a platoon-level officer. Every task assigned by the Party, he completed with strong class feelings, achieving outstanding results. The class he led had won the mobile red flag award thirteen times.

Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, Liu Zhichun deeply understood: the greatest meaning of a person's life lies in dedicating oneself to the proletarian revolutionary cause to the fullest extent, investing one's limited life into the boundless, brilliant cause of communism.

At the end of 1957, according to the organization's decision, he left the army and was transferred to the Tongchuan Coal Mine in Shaanxi Province. When allocating work, the organization, based on his previous role as a deputy platoon leader, planned to assign him as an administrative management officer. However, when Liu Zhichun learned that the mine needed a mixer operator, he insisted on becoming a mixer operator. Some people saw Liu Zhichun, a former deputy platoon leader, become a mixer operator and said he gave up being an officer with "four pockets" to wear the oil-stained clothes of a worker. Liu Zhichun heard this and seriously said, "Comrade, that's not right. Being an officer or a worker, both serve the people. Whether one has prospects or is glorious does not depend on what one does but on whether one wholeheartedly serves the people."

In October 1958, the organization decided to send Liu Zhichun to learn to drive a truck to support transportation work. He immediately said, "The needs of the revolution are my wishes. Although I have been transferred, I still follow orders and listen to commands."

When he was transferred from the army to work in the mine, his salary was based on his deputy platoon leader rank. Later, when he changed jobs, due to a procedural oversight, the automobile station issued his salary as an assistant driver, which was only about a third of his original salary. Many comrades suggested that Liu Zhichun ask about the mistake, but he firmly refused, saying, "We are revolutionaries and must put 'public' above 'private,' abandoning all selfish thoughts. For the communist ideal, we must work hard all our lives, seeking neither fame nor wealth, and be the people's old yellow ox forever."

Chairman Mao said in "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "We must all learn from his selfless and devoted spirit. From this point of view, one can become a great benefit to the people. A person's abilities may be great or small, but as long as one has this spirit, one is a noble person, a pure person, a person of virtue, a person who has transcended lowly interests, and a person who benefits the people." Liu Zhichun always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, learning from Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessness and devotion, taking his work extremely seriously, and showing extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people.

For seven years, he drove his truck along the Weihe River in the eastern part of Guanzhong, from the Loess Plateau in the north to the Qinling Mountains in the south of Weinan, covering a total of more than 180,000 kilometers. Wherever the truck went, he served the people.

Liu Zhichun, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, created heroic deeds. He said, "It was Chairman Mao who liberated me from suffering. It was Mao Zedong Thought that taught me to serve the people. Without Chairman Mao, there would be no Liu Zhichun. In the future, I will better respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, raise the level of studying Chairman Mao's works, focus on 'using' them, truly do what Chairman Mao teaches, and be a good soldier and driver for Chairman Mao."

专栏：

    英雄司机刘志春
    编者按：我们十分兴奋地看到，在我国交通运输战线上，涌现了一个麦贤得式的英雄人物。
    英雄司机刘志春同志，是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育起来的无产阶级硬骨头。在荒无人烟的秦岭深山中，在狂风暴雨的恶劣气候下，刘志春同志身负重伤，仍然以无比惊人的毅力，把心爱的解放牌汽车，开到安全地带。正如通讯中所说的，这辆汽车前进的动力，不是来自内燃机，而是来自战无不胜的毛泽东思想，来自对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心。
    刘志春同志的光辉事迹，再一次告诉我们：搞好思想革命化的关键，就是要把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂。我们要培养共产主义新人，就是要培养具有彻底的无产阶级世界观的人，就是要培养用毛泽东思想彻底改造自己灵魂的人。只有把毛泽东思想深深地印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上，才能真正做到不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一切为人民，在为社会主义和共产主义事业的斗争中，发挥出无限的光和热。
    伟大的毛泽东时代，是英雄辈出的时代。陕西省关中汽车运输公司渭南中心站汽车司机刘志春，在道路艰险的秦岭山区，在狂风暴雨的紧急关头，冒着生命危险抢救了快要滑入山沟的汽车，在身负重伤后，继续坚持战斗，把车开到安全地点，用伟大的毛泽东思想谱写了又一曲共产主义的凯歌。
    只要还有一口气，就要把车开出去
    一九六五年夏天，刘志春所在的车组，接受了一项支援国家建设的重要任务，沿着十分险峻的秦岭山区便道运输一批木材。
    七月七日，是这个行车小组进山拉运木材的第七天。下午，刘志春驾驶着他心爱的解放牌汽车，爬过一个又一个陡坡，登上了土地岭主峰。这时天色突变，霎时间乌云翻滚，狂风大作，一场暴风雨就要来临了。这里山势险要，路面狭窄，前不挨村，后不着店，怎么办？刘志春心想：志愿军英雄们，当年能在枪林弹雨中，把军用物资运到前沿阵地，现在自己能在这样一点困难面前退缩吗？不，决不！一定要听毛主席的话，勇往直前，继续战斗。他聚精会神地驾驶着汽车，在泥泞的道路上顶风冒雨前进。这时，他想起了毛主席的教导：“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人。”为了在恶劣条件下，能够安全行车，刘志春选择一个缓坡，把车停住，准备检查刹车设备。
    汽车后轮陷在泥中。底盘离地面很近。刘志春几乎是把整个身子贴紧地面才爬到车底后部。他动手去拧紧后轮的刹车螺丝。这时，由于风力过大和刹车回气的影响，汽车突然顺坡向下滑动，下面不远就是山沟，眼看就有翻车的危险。在这紧急关头，把人民利益当作自己第一生命的刘志春只有一个念头：人在车在，决不能让车翻下去。毛主席的“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”的教导给刘志春增加了无穷的力量。他毫不犹豫地冒着生命危险，挺身用肩头顶住汽车后轴。汽车还在继续下滑，刘志春也被推得贴地向下滑。他一面使尽全身力气扛车轴，一面迅速机智地拧刹车螺丝，终于在半坡上把车刹住了。
    一场重大的覆车之祸，被用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄司机制止了。然而，我们的英雄却负了重伤。刘志春的头部被汽车后牙包和碎石路面挤压，从右额上侧至脑后三分之一的头皮被撕脱外翻，颅骨外露，骨膜损缺。耳朵一只被刮掉，一只被撕裂成三块，肩膀、胳膊和腿部也受了伤。
    刘志春从车下爬出来，只觉头部麻木，一阵阵眩晕。他定神向四周一看，只见狂风在咆哮，暴雨在倾泻，全身感到一阵阵剧痛。刘志春想：如果山洪暴发，崖塌水淹，汽车仍有遭毁坏的危险，只要自己还有一口气，就一定要把车开到安全地带，把它完整无损地交给人民。就是自己牺牲了，也要让车继续为社会主义服务！想到这里，他精神振奋，斗志高昂，脱下自己的衬衣把撕裂的头皮粗粗包上，忍着剧痛爬进驾驶室。这时，他看到贴在驾驶室里的毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的教导给他增添了无穷的力量。顿时，刘志春感到浑身是劲。他便用脚尖踩油门，脚跟虚踩在刹车踏板上，他想：万一我在行车中昏迷或死去，身子向后一仰，腿一挺，就会踩住刹车，纵然我死了，汽车也能保住。——这就是我们的英雄，在死亡面前，坚定不移地维护人民利益的伟大气质。
    秦岭深山中，这辆解放牌汽车，在急风暴雨中前进。这辆汽车前进的动力，不是来自汽车内燃机，而是来自伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。血，浸透了刘志春包头的衣衫，流在手臂上，流在方向盘上……但是，这个麦贤得式的英雄，用对党、对毛主席的无限忠诚，战胜了一切困难。他紧咬牙关，目光炯炯地盯着前方，驾驶着车辆，在崎岖不平的山路上，拐了八个急弯，过了两条河，上下六个山坡，经过四华里多路程，把汽车开到了东坪生产队。
    生产队卫生所的一位老中医，在没有麻醉药物辅助的情况下，为刘志春清洗伤口，进行包扎。阵阵伤痛使刘志春脸上不断淌下豆大的汗珠。但是，就在这种情况下，刘志春想到的也不是自己。他发觉了老中医的不安，便说：“老大爷，你别怕，我不疼，该咋治就咋治。”发须斑白的老中医，激动得说不出话来，眼里含着泪花，望着他，点了点头，为刘志春包扎了伤口。包扎完毕，刘志春便昏了过去。
    七月八日清晨，刘志春被送到了渭南专区医院。这时，他由于失血过多，生命垂危。但他在昏迷中还不断地说：“车……我的车……。”
    在手术室里，医生和护士，含着热泪，为英雄清洗伤部的泥沙和杂物，进行缝合手术。在八个多钟头的手术过程中，刘志春一声没有哼。他这种坚强精神，使全体医护人员非常激动。一位转业的老军医十分感动地说：“这不是一个普通的病人，他和过去从战场上下来的硬骨头伤员没有两样！”
    手术后，陕西省关中汽车运输公司渭南中心站站长来看刘志春时，他还处在昏迷之中。当护士告诉他后，神志不清的刘志春马上从床上举起一只空手，说：“站长，这是我（汽车上）的钥匙。……我没有完成任务，……我的车后天该二保了。”他的舍己为公的无产阶级革命精神，深深地感动了每一个人的心。
      毛泽东思想是政治上的方向盘
    刘志春掉下来的耳朵，经过再植后，一直发青发紫。医生和护士们多么希望他的耳朵很快长活啊！但是最后，医护人员认为耳朵坏死的可能性很大，决定把情况逐渐透露给他，使他在思想上有所准备。不料刘志春听后，朗然一笑，说：“没有耳朵有什么关系，只要能听广播，能听到毛主席的声音就行！”停了一下又说：“即使我听不到了，我还有两只眼睛，两只手，还可以为人民服务！”
    刘志春的伤口还没有愈合，便偷偷下床，给同房病人读毛主席的书，念毛主席语录。他很快被选为外科病房学习毛主席著作的组长。
    刘志春一面和病员一起学习《为人民服务》，一面自觉地按照毛主席的教导，热情地替病人端水送饭，倒尿盆。同病房有一位患肠穿孔的七十多岁的老贫农司成义，动手术后，人民公社派了一位社员来照顾他，刘志春劝这位社员回去，由自己来照顾司成义。每天给他喂药喂饭，背他上厕所。经常念毛主席语录给他听，整整服侍了二十多天。司成义出院时感动地拉着刘志春的双手说：“志春呀！我一辈子没有见过你这么好的人。”刘志春却对他说：“我没学毛主席的书时，也不懂得为人民服务；是毛主席教我为人民服务的，你要感谢毛主席他老人家。”
    刘志春在医院养伤时，有一次看见医院救护车司机刘存福在检修机件，便去帮忙。谈话中他问刘存福：“你学习毛主席著作怎么样？”刘存福回答说：“咱们开车的你知道，整天在外边跑，学得不好。”刘志春说：“咱们开车要靠方向盘，毛主席著作就是咱们政治上思想上的方向盘，只有掌握好政治上思想上的方向盘，才能掌握好汽车方向盘，才能开好车。”刘志春的话给了刘存福很大启发，他决心向刘志春学习。现在刘存福已经成为医院职工学习毛主席著作积极分子。
    一个多月后，刘志春的伤势有了很大好转，虽然伤口还没有完全愈合，但他坚决要求出院。在他连续七八次的恳求下，医院最后批准他出院养伤。刘志春回到汽车站，向领导上隐瞒了伤情，很快又出车了。
      听毛主席的话，做一个纯粹的人
    刘志春出生在陕西省临潼县铁炉人民公社一个贫农家庭，今年三十一岁。从记事的时候起，他父母就经常给他讲述在那吃人的旧社会，全家人悲惨的遭遇：爹交不起地租坐牢房，娘交不起壮丁费遭毒打，大哥为了逃壮丁到处流浪，两个弟弟活活被饿死、病死。到一九四九年，好容易盼到全国解放，他内心是多么高兴啊！但是，那时他还在外县一家私营药铺里当学徒，受着资本家的压迫。这一切，在刘志春幼小的心灵里，深深地扎下了阶级仇恨的根子。
    一九五一年，他再也受不了资本家的压迫了。那时他刚刚十六岁，三番五次要求毅然参加了光荣的人民解放军。入伍后，在部队这所毛泽东思想的大学校里，刘志春经过了近七年时间的锻炼，逐渐成长为一位副排级干部。党交给他的每项工作，他总是带着强烈的阶级感情去完成，取得了优异的成绩。他所领导的班，曾十三次荣获流动红旗奖。
    刘志春在毛泽东思想的哺育下，深深懂得：一个人活着的最大意义，就在于把自己的一生最大限度地贡献给无产阶级革命事业，把自己有限的生命，投入到无限的光辉灿烂的共产主义事业中去。
    一九五七年年底，他按照组织的决定，离开部队，转业到陕西省铜川煤矿。在分配工作的时候，组织上根据他转业前担任副排长的情况，打算分配他作行政管理干部。但是，当刘志春知道矿井上正需要搅拌机手后，他就坚决要求当搅拌机手。有人看见刘志春由副排长转业当搅拌机手，便说他放着“四个兜”的干部不当，却穿上了满身油泥的工人服。刘志春听了，严肃地说：“同志，这话可不对，当干部当工人都是为人民服务。有出息没出息，光荣不光荣，不在你当什么，而看你是不是全心全意为人民。”
    一九五八年十月，组织上决定派刘志春学习开汽车，支援交通运输工作。他又毫不犹豫地说：“革命的需要，就是我的愿望，我虽然转业了，仍然服从命令听指挥。”
    他从部队转业当矿工时，工资是按副排级发的，后来当他调动工作时，由于手续上的疏忽，汽车站按司机助手发给工资，只相当原来工资的三分之一多一点。不少同志让刘志春去问一问是不是搞错了，刘志春坚决不去，他说：“我们是革命者，一定要以‘公’字吃掉‘私’字，抛掉一切私心杂念。为了共产主义理想，要一辈子埋头工作，不求名，不为利，一辈子当人民的老黄牛。”
    毛主席在《纪念白求恩》一文中说：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”刘志春时时刻刻牢记毛主席的教导，学习白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，对工作极端的负责任，对同志对人民极端的热忱。
    七年来，他驾驶的汽车，在关中东部的渭河两岸，从渭北的黄土高原到渭南的秦岭丛中，总共行驶了十八万多公里，车开到那里，为人民服务到那里。
              ×　　×　　×
  刘志春在毛泽东思想的指引下创造了英雄业绩。他说：“是毛主席把我从苦海中解放出来，是毛泽东思想哺育我懂得了为人民服务。没有毛主席就没有我刘志春。今后我要更好地响应林彪同志的号召，把学习毛主席著作提高到新的水平，在‘用’字上狠下功夫，真正做到读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，好司机。”
