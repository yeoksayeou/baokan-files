In August 1964, a platoon in a certain company of the People's Liberation Army set up a Chairman Mao Quotation Board.

At first, they changed the content of the quotation board every day without considering the actual effects, and the results were not significant. Later, they studied a passage from Chairman Mao's "On Practice": "If one has correct ideas but does not put them into practice, or goes into practice in a perfunctory fashion, one is still not doing practical work." Through this study, they realized that the effectiveness of the quotation board depends on whether it can solve practical problems. From then on, they paid attention to starting from reality when writing quotations, using the ability to solve ideological problems as the criterion for measuring the effectiveness of the quotation board.

At the beginning of a construction project, most of the platoon members lacked experience and were worried about not completing the task. After a platoon meeting, everyone agreed that the fear of difficulties was the main ideological problem at the moment, and decided to address this problem by finding appropriate quotations. Comrade Wu Xingfa, an old soldier, provided a quotation: "We must face up to difficulties, analyze difficulties, and struggle against difficulties." This quotation was posted on the small blackboard, and after studying it, everyone was inspired, gained confidence, and displayed a tenacious fighting spirit in the face of difficulties, successfully completing the task assigned by the superiors.

The quotation board in this platoon, once set up, would guide everyone to act accordingly. If it did not achieve the desired effect, it would not be erased. The main methods of guidance were:

1. Adding annotations. On the small blackboard, it was explained why this quotation was posted, so that everyone could understand the purpose and know what problem it was addressing.

2. Infusing the spirit of the quotations into all activities of the platoon.

3. Organizing discussions. Every evening, based on the quotations on the small blackboard, the platoon leader, the study group leader, or the soldiers would discuss the day's thoughts and work, linking them to the quotations.

Because this platoon worked hard on the quotations, the small blackboard became an indispensable and important ideological weapon in the platoon.

    从实际出发办语录板
    一九六四年八月，解放军某连三班办起了毛主席语录板。
    一开始，他们办语录板，不问实际效果，只管天天变换内容，收效不显著。后来，他们学习了毛主席在《实践论》中的一段教导：“如果有了正确的理论，只是把它空谈一阵，束之高阁，并不实行，那末，这种理论再好也是没有意义的。”通过学习，他们才认识到：语录板办得好不好，要看你能不能解决实际问题。从这以后，他们抄语录就注意从实际出发，把能否解决思想问题，作为衡量语录板成效大小的标准。
    在一次施工初期，班里大部分同志缺乏施工经验，担心完不成任务。经过班务会研究，大家一致认为畏难情绪是当前的重要思想问题，决定针对这个问题分头找语录。老战士吴兴法提供了一条语录：“我们要承认困难，分析困难，向困难作斗争。”小黑板上登了这段语录，大家学习后，受到了鼓舞，增强了信心，在困难面前发扬了顽强战斗的革命精神，胜利地完成了上级交给的任务。
    这个班的语录板不出则已，一出就要引导大家照着去做。不做到，不擦掉。引导的主要办法：
    一是加按语。在小黑板上说明为什么要出这段语录，使大家一看，就能明“矢”知“的”，懂得是为了解决什么问题。
    二是把语录的精神贯穿到全班一切活动中去。
    三是组织讲评。每天晚上，根据小黑板上的语录，联系一天的思想和工作情况，由班长讲、学习小组长讲或战士轮流讲。
    由于这个班在用字上狠下功夫，因此语录小黑板就越办越有成效，成了班里一天不可缺少的最重要的思想武器。
