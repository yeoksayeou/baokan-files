	There is No "Final Destination" in Revolution
	Engineer Guo Yingfu

	Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, on October 27 this year, inscribed the words "The people's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of history's advance" for the "Mao Zedong" locomotive on its 20th anniversary. Comrade Lin Biao's inscription greatly inspired the crew of this locomotive. Everyone unanimously declared: We must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high, especially to study the "Three Articles" as a guiding principle, use the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" to thoroughly transform our subjective world, strive to master Mao Zedong Thought, to thoroughly break down the "self" and establish the "public," and advance courageously on the road of ideological revolutionization. Recently, the crew of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive held a study session on the "Three Articles," and here are some of the speeches from the session.

	We drive trains, and there is a starting point and a destination. But is there a "final destination" in revolution? After studying Chairman Mao's works, I have a relatively correct understanding of this question.

	In the past, when I was a fireman, I longed to become an assistant engineer; when I became an assistant engineer, I yearned for the position of engineer. When I finally became an engineer, for the first few years, my work was still acceptable. But as time went on, my mind unconsciously developed a wrong idea: that I had reached the end. I neither wanted to be an official nor an engineer, and my culture was low, so I thought being an engineer was the "final destination." Under the guidance of this thought, I sought stability in everything. Sometimes the station asked to add more carriages, and I was afraid that if I pulled too many, I would be late and bear responsibility; sometimes the dispatcher asked to catch up, and I didn't want to, fearing both fuel consumption and accidents. Such "stability" led to the emergence of a thought: driving trains is too responsible, dealing with the "iron tiger" every day, and if something goes wrong, it would cause losses to the country, and I would have to bear the responsibility. It would be better to find a "light" job to do.

	Just as my thoughts were in turmoil, I opened "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and pondered over these words of Chairman Mao:

	"Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of complete selflessness and dedication to the people is manifested in his extreme responsibility to his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people." Chairman Mao's words made me realize: serving the people is a lifelong matter and cannot be done for a while and then stop at the "final destination." I also compared it with Comrade Zhang Zide's spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, feeling that although I drive the train forward every day, my thoughts are going backward. If I don't brake urgently, I will derail and have an accident.

	Chairman Mao's words are the most powerful. I made up my mind to learn from Comrade Norman Bethune's communist spirit, to be in the locomotive but look at the world; to learn from Comrade Zhang Zide's spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and to fight for the liberation cause of the oppressed people of the world. With my thoughts clear, my revolutionary spirit was boosted. After that, I not only settled down to my work as an engineer but also took the initiative to do more work and do it well. When the dispatcher asked to catch up, I would happily complete the task ahead of time; sometimes when the train was delayed, I would actively help the station with loading and unloading. Once, I had a boil on my leg, and the hospital gave me three sick leaves, but I didn't rest and insisted on working despite my illness. It was only when the leadership ordered me to rest that I finally did so.

	I deeply feel that: no matter what work a person does, if they do not arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and establish a worldview of serving the people wholeheartedly, they will not be able to do revolutionary work well. We who drive trains often look forward and look back. Looking forward, we must see the bright path illuminated by Chairman Mao and the revolutionary cause of China's 700 million people and the 3 billion people of the world; looking back, we must see how our path has been walked and not forget our roots. There is no "final destination" in revolution. For an individual, no matter how great the achievements, it is always the "starting point." I will forever advance along the revolutionary path illuminated by Chairman Mao and drive trains for the revolution for a lifetime.

### 干革命没有“终点站”

    往前看，就要看到毛主席指引的光明大道，看到中国七亿人民和全世界三十亿人民的革命事业。
    干革命没有“终点站”
    司机　郭映福
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志，今年十月二十七日，为“毛泽东号”机车命名二十周年的题词是：“毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头”。林彪同志的题词，极大地鼓舞了这台机车的乘务人员。大家一致表示：要坚决响应林彪同志的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新的高潮，特别是要把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，用“只争朝夕”的革命精神狠狠地改造主观世界，努力把毛泽东思想学到手，要大破“私”字，大立“公”字，在思想革命化的道路上奋勇前进。最近，“毛泽东号”机车乘务人员举行了学习“老三篇”讲用会，这里刊登的是讲用会上的部分发言。
    我们开火车有个始发站和终点站，干革命有没有“终点站”呢？学习了毛主席著作，我对这个问题才有了比较正确的认识。
    过去当司炉时，我就盼望着当个副司机；当上了副司机，我又想望着司机的职位。当我真的当上了司机，头几年工作还可以，时间一长，头脑里就不知不觉地产生一种错误思想，认为这一下到头了；我一不想当干部，二不想当工程师，自己文化又低，当个司机算到“终点站”了。在这种思想指导下，什么事情我都求一个“稳”字。有时候车站要求多挂几个车皮，我怕拉多了，晚了点要担责任；有时候调度员要求赶点，我也不愿意赶，既怕费煤又怕闯祸。这样“稳”来“稳”去，到后来，竟然出现了这样一个念头：开火车这玩艺儿责任太大，整天跟“铁老虎”打交道，弄不好就出个事故，给国家造成损失，自己还要承担责任，不如找个“轻闲”工作干干。
    就在我思想激烈动摇的时候，我翻开《纪念白求恩》，反复琢磨毛主席这几句话：
  “白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”毛主席的话，使我认识到：为人民服务是一辈子的事情，绝不能干一阵就到“终点”了。我又对照了张思德同志“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的革命精神，感到自己虽然每天开着火车向前跑，但是思想上却在开倒车。如果不紧急“刹车”，就会使自己走入“岔线”，就有“撞车”的危险。
    毛主席的话威力最大。我下定决心要学习白求恩同志的共产主义精神，身在机车放眼世界；学习张思德同志“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务的精神，为世界上被压迫人民的解放事业奋斗到底。思想通了，革命的劲头就足了。以后，我不但安心司机工作，而且主动争取多干些工作，把工作干好。遇上调度员要求赶点，我总是心情舒畅地提前完成；有时拉慢点列车，就主动帮助车站装卸货物。有一次我腿上长了疮，医院开了三次休假证明，我都没有休息，一直带病坚持工作，最后还是领导上下了命令，我才休息。
    我深深体会到：一个人不论干什么工作，如果不用毛泽东思想武装自己，不树立起全心全意为人民服务的世界观，就不可能把革命工作干好。我们开火车的经常往前看，也往后看。往前看，就要看到毛主席指引的光明大道，看到中国七亿人民和全世界三十亿人民的革命事业；往后看，就要看看我们的路是怎样走过来的，不能忘本。干革命是没有“终点站”的。对个人来说，不管做出多大成绩，也永远是“始发站”。我要永远沿着毛主席指引的革命道路前进，为革命开一辈子火车。
