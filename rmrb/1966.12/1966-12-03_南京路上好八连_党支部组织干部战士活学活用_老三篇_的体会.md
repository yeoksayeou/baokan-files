The editorial department notes: Comrade Lin Biao has instructed that to truly master Chairman Mao's thought, "one must grasp the spiritual essence; one must grasp the method." The Eighth Company studies Chairman Mao's works according to Comrade Lin Biao's instructions. They organize the soldiers, based on their different backgrounds, experiences, and situations, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a targeted manner, truly achieving "one key for one lock." They use the great Mao Zedong Thought to unite soldiers from all over the country, to unify the thoughts of soldiers with different levels of consciousness, making this company a genuine revolutionary furnace and an iron collective.

Those who come from all over the country to the People's Liberation Army, this great school, are all young people in their early twenties. They are in the process of forming their worldviews. We must seize these few short years to help them establish a proletarian worldview, so that they will follow Chairman Mao's words and the Party's words for life, and serve the people for life. The worldview is the "master switch." Once the master switch is turned on, all the lights will be lit. Turning Mao Zedong Thought into one's soul provides a guiding principle, making all problems solvable.

Helping young soldiers establish a proletarian worldview is not an easy task; it requires a lot of hard and meticulous work. Due to their different backgrounds and levels of consciousness, helping them study the "Three Articles" requires targeted approaches.

Here are a few examples:

Soldier Yang Jiping's parents and sister are all Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres. When he first enlisted, he thought of himself as a "red descendant" and was assigned to the Eighth Company as a soldier, moving from one "red safe" to another, a "double insurance." He said, "In this 'safe,' even if I am not red, others will make me red." Therefore, he did not demand much of himself and often showed signs of arrogance and self-satisfaction.

The Party branch seized on this characteristic and helped him study the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle. Chairman Mao's words illuminated his heart, making him realize that our society is full of class struggle, and the contradictions and struggles in his mind are reflections of the class struggle in society. He still had bourgeois individualist thoughts in his mind, so how could he "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people? He further realized that there is no such thing as being red by birth; one must be tempered to become red. Relying on the "red safe" is not safe; only by honestly following Chairman Mao's words, reading Chairman Mao's books, and diligently transforming one's thoughts can one be truly safe, the safest. From then on, he strictly demanded of himself, tempered himself diligently, and made rapid progress. Last year, he was rated as a Five-Good Soldier, and this year, he was proudly admitted to the Party.

Soldier Shao Jinceng is an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in our company. In 1962, he was transferred to our production team for production work. Initially, due to his insufficient understanding of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, although he studied a lot, he did not use it for self-transformation. Once he encountered labor, he developed thoughts of fearing hardship, fatigue, and ugliness, had low spirits, and performed poorly. The Party branch discovered this problem and specially dispatched cadres to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with him, helping him to use Zhang Side as an example, using the two measures of "completely" and "thoroughly" to examine his thoughts and conduct a self-inspection. They also mobilized old comrades in the team to provide specific help. He gradually realized that his attitude towards labor is a worldview issue. After that, he studied the "Three Articles" more consciously, fought against his private thoughts more fiercely, and his attitude towards labor also became correct.

Shao Jinceng originally served as deputy squad leader. Last year, their squad leader became a platoon leader, and he thought he would definitely become the squad leader this time. But then he thought again and immediately felt that this idea did not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings. He studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" again, removed his private thoughts, corrected his attitude, and also spoke at the company's study session on applying Chairman Mao's works. At this time, some comrades commented, "Shao Jinceng has many private thoughts." The Party branch believed that breaking private thoughts and establishing public thoughts, destroying bourgeois ideas and establishing proletarian ideas, showing recurring phenomena, is normal and conforms to the objective laws of ideological transformation. The Party branch promptly praised Shao Jinceng and told everyone that only by using the "Three Articles" as a weapon and daring to fight against one's private thoughts, can one gradually transform one's worldview and elevate one's thoughts to a higher level, truly turning Mao Zedong Thought into one's soul.

Our company's famous model soldier Zhang Wenxue had a very low level of education when he first enlisted and did not even recognize the characters "thoroughly" when studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune." The former political instructor Wang Jingwen studied with him and told him, "Thoroughly means to be like Comrade Zhang Side, a hero on the battlefield, diligently working hard in peacetime, not seeking fame and wealth, not fearing hardship, dedicating everything, even one's life, to the revolutionary cause without reservation." He also told him to always use "completely" and "thoroughly" as a measure to transform thoughts and guide actions. He understood the meaning of serving the people, studied more seriously, and transformed himself more seriously.

Then, we put forward higher requirements for him, telling him that studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune" means to establish the idea of carrying out the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to the end. From then on, Zhang Wenxue studied more consciously and demanded more of himself. When he studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune," he often thought of the New Year's Eve when he was six years old, when his father was beaten by a pseudo-bailiff and could not move, and there was not a single grain of rice in the pot, the whole family hugged and cried. Thinking of the fact that there are still many people in the world who have not been liberated and are still living in pain, he reminded himself to never forget class struggle and inspired himself to dedicate everything to liberating the suffering class brothers in the world.

To study and apply Chairman Mao's "Three Articles," cadres must set an example, be the leaders in studying Chairman Mao's works, and be the guides in ideological transformation. The several political instructors of our company have all played exemplary roles.

The current political instructor, Comrade Wang Chanyou, has insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works every day for several years, no matter how busy his work is. In his studies, he dares to raise questions, dares to reveal his thoughts, and practices what he learns, ensuring his words and deeds are consistent. He said: To grasp the soldiers' "master switch," one must first grasp one's own "master switch." Red lips but not a red heart, words will not be heeded. He studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and strictly demanded of himself according to the measures of "completely" and "thoroughly," putting the Party's interests as his first life. Two years ago, when our company was camping in the mountains, it was very close to his home. To concentrate on his work, he did not tell his family his communication address. He studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and firmly acted according to the two extremes. He often lived among the soldiers, blending in with them, becoming their confidant. The soldiers reflected that the political instructor did not distinguish between times, places, or people when doing ideological work, did not go through the motions. This year in May, when he was hospitalized due to illness, he still asked for dozens of soldiers' study notes to read, understand the situation, and put forward requirements. Comrade Wang Chanyou's exemplary actions set a model for the entire company.

### “南京路上好八连”党支部组织干部战士活学活用“老三篇”的体会

    “南京路上好八连”党支部组织干部战士活学活用“老三篇”的体会
    编者按：林彪同志指示说，要把毛泽东思想真正学到手，“一是掌握精神实质；一是掌握方法”。好八连学习毛主席著作，就是按照林彪同志的指示做的。他们根据战士的不同出身，不同经历和不同情况，有针对性地组织他们活学活用毛主席著作，真正做到了“一把钥匙开一把锁”。他们用伟大的毛泽东思想，把来自五湖四海的战士团结起来了，把有不同觉悟程度的战士的思想统一起来了，使这个连队成为名副其实的革命的熔炉，钢铁的集体。
    从五湖四海来到解放军这个大学校里的，都是二十岁上下的青年人，他们正处在世界观的形成过程中。我们要抓紧短短的几年时间，帮助他们树立无产阶级世界观，使他们一辈子听毛主席的话，听党的话，一辈子为人民服务。世界观是“总开关”，打开总开关，所有的灯就都亮了。把毛泽东思想化为人的灵魂，就有了统帅的东西，什么问题都好解决。
    帮助青年战士树立无产阶级世界观，不是一件容易的事情，需要做许多艰苦细致的工作。由于他们的出身经历不同、觉悟程度不同，帮助他们学习“老三篇”，就要根据他们的特点进行工作。
    下面，我们举几个例子：
    战士杨继平，父母姐姐都是共产党员，革命干部。他刚入伍的时候，认为自己是“红色后代”，又被分配到八连当战士，是从一个“红色保险箱”到另一个“红色保险箱”，是“双保险”。他说：“在这个‘保险箱’里，自己不红，别人也会把我染红。”因此，对自己要求不严，常常流露出骄傲自满的情绪。
    党支部抓住他这个特点，帮助他学习“老三篇”，学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述。毛主席的话，照亮了他的心，使他认识到：我们的社会是充满阶级斗争的社会，自己头脑里的矛盾和斗争，就是社会上阶级斗争的反映。自己头脑里还有资产阶级个人主义思想，怎能“完全”“彻底”为人民服务呢？从而他进一步认识到，没有“自来红”，只有“锻炼红”。靠“红色保险箱”是不保险的，只有老老实实地听毛主席的话，读毛主席的书，踏踏实实地改造自己的思想，才是真正的保险，才是最大的保险。从此，他严格要求自己，刻苦磨炼自己，进步很快，去年被评为五好战士，今年光荣地入了党。
    战士邵金城，是我们连学习毛主席著作的积极分子。他一九六二年调到我们连里的生产组搞生产。开始，他由于对活学活用毛主席著作认识不足，尽管学了很多，不用于思想改造，一接触到劳动，就产生了怕苦怕累怕丑的思想，情绪不高，表现不好。党支部发现这个问题，专门派干部和他一起学习《为人民服务》，帮助他以张思德为榜样，用“完全”“彻底”两把尺子，对照自己的思想，进行检查；又发动组里的老同志对他进行具体帮助。他逐渐认识到对待劳动的态度，是个世界观的问题，以后学习“老三篇”就比较自觉了，斗私心狠了，劳动态度也端正了。
    邵金城原来担任副班长。去年，他们的班长当了排长，他以为自己这次定要当班长了。可是他再一想，就立刻感到自己这个想法不符合毛主席的教导。他再一次学习《为人民服务》，排除了私心杂念，端正了态度，并且在连里学习毛主席著作讲用会上讲了体会。这时，有的同志议论说：“邵金城的私心杂念就是多。”党支部认为：破私立公，灭资兴无，出现反复的现象，是正常的，是符合思想改造的客观规律的。党支部及时表扬了邵金城，并且告诉大家：只有像邵金城那样，以“老三篇”为武器，对自己的私心杂念，敢于进行斗争，才能一点一滴地改造自己的世界观，才能把自己的思想一步一步地推向更高的境界，真正把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂。
      我们连里有名的标兵张文学，刚入伍时，文化程度很低，学习《为人民服务》，连“彻底”两个字都不认识。前任指导员王经文和他一起学习，对他讲：“彻底，就是要像张思德同志那样，战场上是英雄，平时埋头苦干，不为名利，不怕艰苦，把自己的一切甚至生命，毫无保留地献给革命事业。”并且告诉他，要经常用“完全”“彻底”当作尺子，改造思想，指导行动。他懂得为人民服务的道理，学习就更加认真了，自我改造也更加认真了。
    接着，我们对他提出了更高的要求，告诉他学习
  《为人民服务》，就要树立把中国革命和世界革命进行到底的思想。从此，张文学学得更加自觉，对自己要求更严了。他在学习《为人民服务》时，常常想起六岁那年的大年夜，父亲被伪保长打得不能动弹，锅里一粒米都没有，全家人抱头痛哭的情形；再想想世界上还有许多人没有解放，仍然过着痛苦生活的事实，来提醒自己要念念不忘阶级斗争，来激励自己要为解放世界上受苦受难的阶级兄弟贡献一切。
    活学活用毛主席的“老三篇”，干部要做出榜样，做学习毛主席著作的带头人，做思想革命化的领路人。我们连的几任指导员都起了表率作用。
    现任指导员王传友同志，几年来，不论工作怎样忙，都坚持每天学习毛主席著作。他在学习中，肯带问题，敢亮思想，学了就用，言行一致。他说：抓战士的“总开关”，首先要抓好自己的“总开关”，红嘴不红心，说话没人听。他学了《为人民服务》，就按照
  “完全”“彻底”的尺子严格要求自己，把党的利益作为第一生命。前年我们连队在山区野营，离他家很近。他为了集中精力工作，一直没有把通信地址告诉家里。他学了《纪念白求恩》，就坚决按照两个“极端”办事。他经常生活在战士当中，和战士打成一片，做战士的知心人。战士反映：指导员做思想工作不分时间，不分地点，不分彼此，不搞形式。今年五月，他因病住了医院，还要了几十本战士的学习笔记去看，了解情况，提出要求。王传友同志的模范行动，给全连同志树立了榜样。
