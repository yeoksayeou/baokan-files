	Capital and garrisoned troops' cultural workers respond to the call of the proletarian cultural revolution conference in the cultural sector
	March forward in victory along the path indicated by Chairman Mao
	Determined to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in literature and art
	Military cultural workers are thrilled and welcome the inclusion of four art troupes in the military organization

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 5th, after Chairman Mao's eight consecutive receptions of the cultural revolution army, the proletarian cultural revolution conference in the cultural sector held a meeting that brought great encouragement and new fighting strength to the revolutionary cultural workers in the capital. They said that Comrade Zhou Enlai, Comrade Chen Boda, and Comrade Jiang Qing's speeches at the conference fully reflected Chairman Mao's affectionate care and expectations for us, fully reflecting the invincible power and great victories of the great Mao Zedong thought in literature and art. These important speeches greatly boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionaries and struck a heavy blow to the enemy, pointing out the way forward for us. We must march forward in victory along the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

	Revolutionary cultural workers unanimously expressed their determination to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, thoroughly expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the former Propaganda Department, the former Ministry of Culture, and the former Beijing Municipal Committee, and carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation on the literary and artistic front thoroughly, so that the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought can be planted on all literary and artistic fronts.

	Revolutionary cultural workers and revolutionary teachers and students from many art academies in the capital held a meeting with great excitement. They said: This conference full of revolutionary fighting spirit issued a mobilization order to launch a general attack on the power-holders in the cultural sector who took the capitalist road and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in literature and art they represented. It made us clear about the direction of the struggle and added boundless wisdom and strength. We must resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry out the proletarian cultural revolution to the end. The revolutionary Peking opera performers of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe said in a meeting: In the past, under the affectionate care of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and under the direct guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, we fought resolutely against the former Beijing Municipal Committee, the former Propaganda Department, and the former Ministry of Culture, overcame various difficulties, and broke through numerous obstacles to achieve great victories in Peking opera reform. Now, the proletarian cultural revolution conference in the cultural sector has issued a call to battle, and we must follow the instructions of Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, and Jiang Qing to fight more bravely and make the flames of the proletarian cultural revolution in the cultural sector burn more fiercely, and resolutely defeat a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in literature and art they represent.

	Revolutionary cultural workers recalled the sharp struggle between the two classes and two lines on the literary and artistic front over the past decade. Many revolutionary cultural workers angrily denounced: The former Beijing Municipal Committee, the former Propaganda Department, and the former Ministry of Culture controlled the cultural sector and implemented a counter-revolutionary revisionist line in literature and art that was opposed to Chairman Mao's line in literature and art. They pretended to be red but acted against the red, were two-faced, and used various treacherous and vicious means to strongly resist and oppose Chairman Mao's direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature and art, strongly opposed performing revolutionary modern plays, and fiercely opposed propagating the great Mao Zedong Thought. They allowed emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, ancient people, and foreigners to dominate the stage, and promoted feudalism, capitalism, old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, poisoning the souls of revolutionary people and preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. They said, to make literature and art become an integral part of the entire revolutionary machine and a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, striking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy, we must thoroughly carry out the proletarian cultural revolution in the cultural sector. First, we must direct the spearhead of the struggle at a handful of power-holders in the cultural sector who took the capitalist road, overthrow them, and thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in literature and art they represented. We will not stop until we achieve complete victory.

	Revolutionary cultural workers from many art troupes shared their personal experiences and insights, enthusiastically discussing the epoch-making achievements in Peking opera reform, ballet reform, and symphony music reform over the past few years. They said, these achievements were the fruits of victory in the struggle against the former Propaganda Department, the former Ministry of Culture, and the former Beijing Municipal Committee under the guidance of Chairman Mao's line in literature and art. Comrade Jiang Qing made special contributions in the reform of the above-mentioned art fields, personally leading and participating in the struggle and artistic practice. The revolutionary performers of the Central Song and Dance Troupe linked the birth process of the ballet "Red Detachment of Women" and said, just when Comrade Jiang Qing led us to implement Chairman Mao's instruction of "using foreign things for Chinese purposes" and reform ballet, the leaders of the former Propaganda Department and the former Ministry of Culture used various conspiratorial means to sabotage the ballet revolution. When their conspiracy failed and the revolutionary ballet "Red Detachment of Women" was successfully performed, they tried to belittle this great achievement and attempted to strangle the first revolutionary ballet in its cradle. They said, history shattered the illusions of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Chairman Mao personally ignited the flames of the proletarian cultural revolution, and the broad revolutionary masses of our troupe responded to Chairman Mao's call and rose up in rebellion. We exposed a handful of power-holders in the Party who took the capitalist road. We will continue to fight and carry out the cultural revolution to the end. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and firmly walk the path of ballet revolutionization.

	Revolutionary Peking opera performers from the China Peking Opera Troupe, the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe, and the Red Guard performance team from the China Theater Academy and the Beijing Drama Academy, who participated in the National Day performance, said in a meeting: Just during the period when the Jiang Yang group ruled the cultural sector, Comrade Jiang Qing represented the correct line of our great leader Chairman Mao and fought persistently against them, and personally participated in artistic practice and created revolutionary modern plays with the masses. The young rebels said, Peking operas "The Red Lantern," "Shajiabang," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and "Attack on the White Tiger Regiment," as well as the ballet "Red Detachment of Women" and the symphony "Shajiabang," were all completed under the personal leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing. Comrade Jiang Qing shared our joys and sorrows and breathed with us. Every play was soaked with her blood. Comrade Jiang Qing led us to reform Peking opera, making this classical art form adapt to the needs of socialism and become a powerful tool for serving proletarian politics. The revolutionary music workers of the Central Orchestra said, the symphony "Shajiabang" is a bud of proletarian new music nurtured by the sunlight and rain of Mao Zedong Thought. It grew up under the direct leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing and the enthusiastic support of the revolutionary masses of the orchestra and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, breaking through numerous obstacles. In the history of music, symphony music successfully reflected and praised the great Mao Zedong Thought for the first time, which is a great achievement in the symphony music revolution. We must follow the literary and artistic direction indicated by Chairman Mao and create more revolutionary symphony music that is worthy of our great era and loved by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

	Many revolutionary teachers and students from the Central Academy of Drama, the Central Conservatory of Music, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and the Beijing Film Academy in the capital participated in the proletarian cultural revolution conference in the cultural sector. When they returned to school, they were overjoyed. After the conference news was broadcast, some Red Guards and revolutionary students from the Beijing Film Academy listened to the broadcast four times in a row.

	Many young rebels from the Central Conservatory of Music eagerly read the newspaper that published the conference news as soon as they received it and enthusiastically cheered for the successful and good conference. They said excitedly: Holding such a conference in the high tide of the proletarian cultural revolution is like timely rain that moistens our hearts and speaks our minds. The young rebels said, a handful of power-holders in the Party who took the capitalist road in the former Beijing Municipal Committee, the former Propaganda Department, and the former Ministry of Culture stubbornly resisted Chairman Mao's line in literature and art and implemented a counter-revolutionary revisionist line in literature and art in our school, attempting to use literature and art as a tool to corrupt the masses and prepare for the restoration of capitalism. In the proletarian cultural revolution, we rebelled against them, but we know that the struggle is far from over. We have the determination and confidence to carry out this struggle to the end and achieve the final victory.

	To perform revolutionary plays, one must first become a revolutionary. Many revolutionary cultural workers expressed their determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the proletarian cultural revolution, using the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" to transform their worldview. Revolutionary cultural workers from the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe and other four art troupes that were incorporated into the organization of the People's Liberation Army unanimously expressed their determination to follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, take "Three Articles" as their motto, temper and transform themselves in the great melting pot of the People's Liberation Army, test themselves in the fierce class struggle, and strive to become a true proletarian cultural worker who is consistent in words and deeds, speed up the construction of a proletarian and militarized revolutionary cultural team, and make the troupe a true stage for propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

	Revolutionary cultural workers from the Workers' Art Troupe of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and other art troupes said, we must uproot the "self" and search the "self," establish the "public," and eliminate the poison of "three famouss" (famous actors, famous directors, famous writers) and "three highs" (high salary, high manuscript fee, high bonus) spread by the counter-revolutionary revisionists such as Zhou Yang in the cultural sector. We must turn Chairman Mao's care for the cultural sector into the motive force for transforming our thoughts and stage better plays with better political content and higher artistic level to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

	Revolutionary cultural workers said in a meeting, creating the most brilliant and glorious proletarian new culture in human history is a glorious and arduous mission bestowed by history upon us. With the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we can take the path that no one has taken before and climb the peaks that no one has climbed before. Revolutionary cultural workers from the East Is Red Song and Dance Troupe and other art troupes said after participating in the proletarian cultural revolution conference in the cultural sector, Mao Zedong Thought is the guide of the cultural revolution, and Chairman Mao's direction in literature and art is the direction of world revolutionary literature and art. We must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, break down the "self" and establish the "public," and create art that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought to propagate and perform among the revolutionary people of the world, spreading Mao Zedong Thought and making greater contributions to the world revolution.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 5th, cultural workers of the People's Liberation Army garrisoned in Beijing warmly welcomed the convening of the proletarian cultural revolution conference in the cultural sector and expressed their determination to respond to the conference's call, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, highlight proletarian politics, implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry out the proletarian cultural revolution to the end, making Mao Zedong Thought occupy all literary and artistic fronts and create the most brilliant and glorious proletarian new literature and art in human history.

	Some of the cultural workers of the garrisoned troops personally participated in this conference of great significance and listened to the important speeches of Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, and Jiang Qing with great excitement, receiving great encouragement, and their revolutionary spirit and fighting will were more invigorated. Some people studied Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" again. Many art troupes and the August First Film Studio specially published blackboard newspapers and wall newspapers to share their experiences and insights. When the radio broadcasted the news of the conference, many cultural workers listened to it over and over again. As soon as the newspaper arrived, they studied it carefully and held discussions.

	In the discussion and meeting, everyone expressed their strongest support for the important speeches of Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, and Jiang Qing at the conference, unanimously agreeing that the speeches of the central leaders used the great Mao Zedong Thought to deeply and profoundly expound the importance and necessity of carrying out the proletarian cultural revolution in the cultural sector, and gave extremely important instructions for carrying out the proletarian cultural revolution in the cultural sector; it gave the revolutionary cultural army great encouragement and strength to carry out the proletarian cultural revolution to the end and create the most brilliant and glorious proletarian new literature and art in human history. Comrades from the General Political Department Art Troupe, the August First Film Studio, and the Political Department Art Troupe of the Beijing Military Region said in the discussion, the important speeches of the central leaders made us deeply realize the important position and role of literary and artistic revolution in the cultural revolution. The old literature and art cannot adapt to the socialist economic base, and it will inevitably destroy the socialist economic base. We must carry out an unprecedented great reform and revolution in the cultural sector, replacing the old with the new. This is a serious class struggle. We are cultural workers of the army, and we resolutely stand at the forefront of this revolution, bravely shouldering the tasks that our predecessors have not shouldered. We not only thoroughly sweep away the old literature and art of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes but also create new literature and art of the proletariat and socialism, making literature and art better serve proletarian politics, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship and develop the socialist system. Comrades from the Political Department Art Troupe of the Navy and the Political Department Art Troupe of the Railway Corps said in the meeting, all art troupes are propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how many forms of art there are, the fundamental task is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. We must resolutely eliminate the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in literature and art, implement Chairman Mao's line in literature and art, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, carry out the proletarian cultural revolution to the end, and in this struggle that touches the soul, better respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take "Three Articles" as our motto, transform our worldview, promote ideological revolutionization, and become a true proletarian cultural worker.

	The broad cultural workers of the garrisoned troops were thrilled to hear the news that the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China decided that Comrade Jiang Qing would serve as a cultural consultant for the People's Liberation Army. Everyone said, this is the great concern of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao for the military's cultural work, and an important deployment to strengthen the revolutionization and militarization of the troops' cultural work. Comrades from the Political Department War Friend Art Troupe of the Beijing Military Region said in a meeting, Comrade Jiang Qing has a good grasp of Mao Zedong Thought, understands it deeply, and uses it flexibly and resolutely. In the struggle against the revisionist line in the cultural sector, Comrade Jiang Qing personally participated in the struggle and led the reform of Peking opera, ballet, and symphony music and other literary and artistic revolutions, achieving great victories; at the same time, she also showed great concern for the proletarian film industry. This not only set an example for the revolution of other arts but also made special contributions to the creation of new literature and art of the proletariat and socialism. The unyielding fighting spirit and tenacious will she showed in breaking through numerous difficulties and obstacles have set a brilliant example for us revolutionary cultural workers. Comrades from the Political Department Art Troupe of the Air Force linked Comrade Jiang Qing's many affectionate concerns and instructions and said, Comrade Jiang Qing serving as a cultural consultant for the People's Liberation Army is our honor and happiness! Our troupe received many important instructions from Comrade Jiang Qing when creating and rehearsing programs, even down to a line of dialogue and a movement. What is particularly unforgettable is that Comrade Jiang Qing specially gave us two sets of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," instructing us to always follow Chairman Mao's direction in literature and art. Cultural workers of the garrisoned troops unanimously expressed their determination to, under the leadership of the Central Military Commission, the General Political Department, and Comrade Jiang Qing, in the promotion and encouragement of the proletarian cultural revolution, achieve greater results and greater victories in propagating Mao Zedong Thought, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving socialism, serving to eliminate the bourgeoisie and establish the proletariat, and consolidating and improving the troops' combat effectiveness, and turn the art troupe into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, using literature and art as a weapon to better serve the Chinese people and the people of the world.

	The cultural workers of the garrisoned troops warmly welcomed the incorporation of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe and other art troupes into the organization of the People's Liberation Army and their inclusion in the military sequence, becoming a fighting force for the army to carry out political and ideological work. Everyone expressed their determination to learn from the revolutionary comrades of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe and other art troupes, strengthen unity, fight side by side, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive together to create new literature and art of the proletariat and socialism.

    首都和驻京部队文艺战士响应文艺界无产阶级文化大革命大会号召
    坚决沿着毛主席指引的方向胜利前进
    决心更好地活学活用毛主席著作，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，彻底摧毁反革命修正主义文艺路线
    解放军文艺战士对江青同志担任文化工作顾问感到欢欣鼓舞，热烈欢迎四个文艺团体列入部队建制
      据新华社五日讯　在毛主席连续八次接见文化革命大军之后举行的文艺界无产阶级文化大革命大会，给首都广大革命文艺战士带来了极大的鼓舞和新的战斗力量。他们说，周恩来同志、陈伯达同志和江青同志在大会上的讲话，充分体现了毛主席对我们的
  亲切关怀和期望，充分体现了伟
  大的毛泽东文艺思想战无不胜的
  强大威力和所取得的伟大胜利。这些重要讲话，大长了无产阶级革命志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，为我们指出了前进的道路。我们一定要沿着毛主席指引的方
  向胜利前进。
      革命文艺战士们一致表示，一定要牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，彻底揭发、彻底批判旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委的反革命修正主义路线，把文艺战线上的斗、批、改，搞深搞透搞彻底，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍一切文艺阵地。
    参加这次大会的首都革命文艺工作者和艺术院校的许多革命师生，怀着万分激动的心情举行座谈，他们说：这个充满革命战斗精神的大会，对我们发出了向文艺界走资本主义道路的当权派和他们所代表的反革命修正主义文艺路线进行总攻击的动员令。它使我们明确了斗争的大方向，增添了无穷的智慧和力量。我们一定要坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。北京京剧一团的革命京剧演员们在座谈中说，过去，我们在毛主席和党中央的亲切关怀下，在江青同志的直接指导下，与旧北京市委、旧中宣部、旧文化部进行了坚决的斗争，克服了种种困难，冲破了重重阻力，取得了京剧改革的巨大胜利。现在，文艺界无产阶级文化大革命大会又发出了战斗的号召，我们一定要遵照周恩来、陈伯达和江青同志的指示，更勇猛地投入战斗，把文艺界无产阶级文化大革命的烈火烧得更旺，坚决打倒一小撮反革命修正主义分子，彻底粉碎他们所代表的反革命修正主义文艺路线。
    广大革命文艺战士回顾了十多年来文艺战线上两个阶级、两条路线的尖锐斗争。许多革命文艺工作者愤怒地控诉：旧北京市委、旧中宣部、旧文化部把持着文艺界，推行着一条与毛主席文艺路线相对抗的反革命修正主义文艺路线，他们打着“红旗”反红旗，阳奉阴违，两面三刀，采取种种阴险毒辣的手段，极力抗拒和反对毛主席提出的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，极力反对演革命现代戏，疯狂反对宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，让帝王将相、才子佳人、古人、洋人统治着舞台，宣扬封建主义、资本主义的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，毒害革命人民的灵魂，为资本主义复辟制造舆论准备。他们说，我们要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，就必须彻底进行文艺界的无产阶级文化大革命，首先要把斗争的锋芒指向文艺界一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把他们斗垮、斗倒、斗臭，把他们所代表的反革命修正主义文艺路线彻底摧毁，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    许多文艺团体的革命文艺战士用他们的亲身经历和体会，畅谈了这几年来在京剧改革、芭蕾舞剧改革、交响音乐改革等方面所取得的划时代的成就。他们说，这些成就都是在毛主席文艺路线的指引下，同旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委进行斗争的胜利成果。江青同志在上述文艺领域的改革中，亲自领导和参加了斗争实践和艺术实践，作出了特殊的贡献。中央歌剧舞剧院芭蕾舞剧团的革命演员们，联系芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》的诞生过程说，正当江青同志领导我们贯彻毛主席的“洋为中用”的指示，对芭蕾舞剧进行改革的时候，旧中宣部、旧文化部的领导人，采取了种种阴谋手段，破坏芭蕾舞剧革命。当他们的阴谋遭到失败，革命的芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》成功地演出后，他们又极力贬低这一巨大成就，妄想把第一个革命芭蕾舞剧扼杀在摇篮里。他们说，历史打破了反革命修正主义分子的迷梦。毛主席亲手点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的烈火，我们剧团的广大革命群众响应毛主席的号召，起来造反了，我们把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派揪了出来。我们要继续战斗下去，把文化大革命进行到底，我们一定要遵循毛主席的教导，坚定不移地走芭蕾舞剧革命化的道路。
    中国京剧院、北京京剧一团的革命京剧演员，和中国戏曲学校、北京戏剧专科学校参加国庆演出的红卫兵演出队的小将们，在座谈中说，就在周扬一伙统治文艺界的时期，江青同志代表我们伟大领袖毛主席的正确路线，同他们进行了坚持不懈的斗争，并且亲自参加艺术实践，同群众一起创作革命现代戏。小将们说，京剧《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《智取威虎山》、《奇袭白虎团》以及芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，交响音乐《沙家浜》等样板戏，都是在江青同志亲自领导下胜利完成的。江青同志和群众同甘苦，共呼吸，每个戏都渗透着她的心血。江青同志领导我们进行京剧改革，使这个古典的艺术形式适应于社会主义的需要，成为为无产阶级政治服务的有力工具。中央乐团的革命音乐工作者说，交响音乐《沙家浜》是毛泽东思想的阳光和雨露培育出来的无产阶级新音乐的幼苗。它是在江青同志的直接领导下，在乐团革命群众和广大工农兵群众的热情支持下，冲破重重阻挠成长起来的。在音乐史上，交响乐第一次成功地反映和歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想，这是交响音乐革命的硕果。我们一定要沿着毛主席指引的文艺方向，更多地创作出无愧于我们伟大时代的，为广大工农兵群众所喜爱的革命的交响音乐。
    中央戏剧学院、音乐学院、美术学院和北京电影学院等首都艺术院校的许多革命师生，参加了文艺界无产阶级文化大革命大会，回校时，他们欢欣若狂，当大会消息广播以后，北京电影学院的一些红卫兵和革命师生一连收听了四遍广播。
    中央音乐学院的许多小将们，一接到刊登大会消息的报纸，就争相阅读，热烈欢呼这次大会开得成功，开得好！他们兴高采烈地说：在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中召开这样的大会，像及时雨一样滋润了我们的心，说出了我们的心里话。小将们说，旧北京市委、旧中宣部、旧文化部的一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，顽固地抗拒毛主席的文艺路线，在我院推行了一条“向洋不向中，向富不向穷，向大不向小，向古不向今”的反革命修正主义文艺路线，企图把文艺作为腐蚀群众、准备资本主义复辟的工具。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们造了他们的反，但我们知道，斗争还远没有结束，我们有决心、有信心，一定要把这场斗争进行到底，直到取得最后胜利。
    要演革命戏，先做革命人。许多革命文艺工作者表示，在无产阶级文化大革命中，一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，用“只争朝夕”的革命精神改造世界观。划归中国人民解放军建制的北京京剧一团等四个文艺团体的革命文艺工作者们，一致表示，决心遵照林彪同志的指示，把“老三篇”作为座右铭，在人民解放军的革命大熔炉中锻炼自己，改造自己，在火热的阶级斗争中考验自己，努力做一个真正言行一致的无产阶级文艺战士，加速建设无产阶级化战斗化的革命文艺队伍，使剧团成为真正的宣传毛泽东思想的文艺阵地。
    中华全国总工会工人文工团等文艺团体的革命文艺战士说，我们一定要挖“我”字的根，抄“我”字的家，大立公字，肃清周扬等反革命修正主义分子在文艺界播下的“三名”（名演员、名导演、名作家）、“三高”（高工资、高稿酬、高奖金）的流毒。我们要把毛主席对文艺界的关怀，化为改造思想的动力，排演出政治内容更好，艺术水平更高的好戏来为工农兵服务。
    广大革命文艺战士在座谈中说，创造人类历史上最光辉灿烂的无产阶级新文化是历史赋予我们的光荣而又艰巨的使命。有了伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们就能走前人没有走过的路，攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。东方歌舞团等文艺团体的革命文艺战士们参加文艺界无产阶级文化大革命大会以后说，毛泽东思想是文化大革命的指南，毛主席的文艺方向是世界革命文艺的方向。我们一定要努力活学活用毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，创造出闪耀毛泽东思想光辉的文艺，到世界革命人民中去宣传，去演出，传播毛泽东思想，为世界革命作出更大的贡献。
    据新华社五日讯　中国人民解放军驻京部队文艺工作者，热烈地欢呼文艺界无产阶级文化大革命大会的召开，表示坚决响应大会号召，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，让毛泽东思想占领一切文艺阵地，创造人类历史上最光辉灿烂的无产阶级新文艺。
    驻京部队的文艺战士，有一部分亲身参加了这次具有伟大意义的大会，他们怀着激动的心情，听了周恩来同志、陈伯达同志、江青同志的重要讲话，受到极大的鼓舞，革命精神更加振奋，战斗意志更加昂扬。有的人再次学习了毛主席的《新民主主义论》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》等光辉著作。许多文工团和八一电影制片厂专门出版了黑板报、墙报，畅谈心得体会。当电台广播这次大会的消息时，许多文艺工作者一遍接一遍地收听。报纸一到，认真学习，并举行讨论。
    在座谈讨论中，大家表示最热烈地拥护周恩来、陈伯达、江青同志在大会上发表的重要讲话，一致认为，中央负责同志的讲话，运用伟大的毛泽东思想，深刻地、精辟地阐明了文艺界深入开展无产阶级文化大革命的重要性和必要性，对搞好文艺界的无产阶级文化大革命作了极其重要的指示；给革命文艺大军把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，和创造人类历史上最光辉灿烂的无产阶级新文艺以巨大的鼓舞和力量。总政文工团、八一电影制片厂和北京部队空军政治部文工团的同志们在讨论中说，中央负责同志的重要讲话，使我们更加深刻地认识到文艺革命在文化大革命中的重要地位和作用。旧的文学艺术不能适应社会主义的经济基础，那它就必然要破坏社会主义的经济基础。我们必须在文艺界进行一场史无前例的大改革，大革命，推陈出新。这是一场严重的阶级斗争。我们是解放军的文艺战士，我们坚决站在这场革命的最前线，勇敢地担当起前人所没有担负过的任务。我们不但要彻底扫荡资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧文艺，更要创造无产阶级的社会主义的崭新文艺，让文艺更好地为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务，为巩固无产阶级专政和发展社会主义制度服务。海军政治部文工团、铁道兵政治部文工团的同志们在座谈中说，所有文艺团体都是毛泽东思想的宣传队，文艺形式不管千种百种，最根本的任务是宣传毛泽东思想。我们要坚决肃清反革命修正主义文艺路线的影响，贯彻执行毛主席的文艺路线，就要紧紧掌握斗争大方向，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，并在这场触及灵魂的斗争中，更好地响应林彪同志号召，活学活用毛主席著作，以“老三篇”为座右铭，改造世界观，促进思想革命化，做一个真正的无产阶级文艺战士。
    驻京部队广大文艺工作者听到中共中央军委决定江青同志担任中国人民解放军文化工作顾问的消息，个个欢欣鼓舞，都说，这是我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席对军队文化工作的极大关怀，是加强部队文化工作革命化、战斗化的重要部署。北京部队政治部战友文工团的同志们在座谈中说，江青同志对毛泽东思想学得很好，领会得很深，运用得很活，很坚决。在同文艺界修正主义黑线进行斗争的过程中，江青同志亲自参加了斗争实践，亲自领导了京剧改革，芭蕾舞剧改革，交响音乐改革等文艺革命，取得了巨大胜利；同时对无产阶级的电影事业也十分关心。这不仅为其他艺术的革命树立了样板，而且为创造无产阶级的社会主义的新文艺做出了特殊的贡献。她所表现的不屈不挠的斗争精神和冲破重重困难、种种阻挠的顽强意志，为我们革命文艺工作者树立了光辉的榜样。空军政治部文工团的同志们联系到江青同志的许多亲切关怀和指示说，江青同志担任解放军文化工作顾问，这是我们的光荣和幸福！我们团在创作排练节目的时候，江青同志作过许多重要的指导，甚至细致到一句台词，一个动作。特别使我们难忘的是，江青同志专门送给我们两套《毛泽东选集》，指示我们永远沿着毛主席的文艺方向前进。驻京部队的文艺工作者一致表示，决心在中共中央军委、总政治部和江青同志的领导下，在无产阶级文化大革命的推动和鼓舞下，在宣传毛泽东思想，为工农兵服务，为社会主义服务，为灭资兴无、巩固和提高部队战斗力服务方面，作出更大成绩，取得更大胜利，把文工团办成毛泽东思想的大学校，以文艺为武器更好地为中国人民和世界人民服务。
    驻京部队文艺工作者热烈欢迎北京京剧一团等文艺团体划归中国人民解放军建制，列入部队序列，成为我军进行政治思想工作的战斗队伍。大家表示要向北京京剧一团等文艺团体的革命同志学习，加强团结，并肩战斗，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为创造无产阶级的社会主义的新文艺而共同奋斗。
