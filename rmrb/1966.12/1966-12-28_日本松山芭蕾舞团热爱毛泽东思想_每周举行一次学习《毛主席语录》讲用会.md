In a room next to the rehearsal hall of the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe in Japan, about a dozen people are seated, each holding a bright red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." This is a study session of Mao Zedong Thought, and also a session for discussing the application of "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

This autumn, when the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe returned from their visit to China, the most precious gift they brought back was a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" for each member. After returning to Japan, at the initiative of the troupe's leader, Seisuke Shimizu, they established a study group for "Quotations from Chairman Mao," deciding to hold a study and discussion session every week.

The discussion began with everyone reading aloud from "Quotations from Chairman Mao." After reciting a passage from "In Memory of Norman Bethune," a staff member of the ballet troupe, Fujiko Tachibana, was the first to share her thoughts on studying "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Fujiko works backstage and handles all sorts of tasks. During the ballet troupe's two visits to China, she stayed in Tokyo. Fujiko said, "In the past, I encountered many difficulties at work and felt only distressed, thinking that this job was hard to do. However, after studying the selfless spirit of Norman Bethune in Chairman Mao's works, I realized that the performers on stage are serving the people, and I am also serving the people backstage. I believe that Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful weapon for transforming one's thinking."

During the discussion, a female performer added: "In the past, when I watched dance and film performances, I paid more attention to their technical aspects. However, recently, through studying Mao Zedong Thought, my perspective has changed. I can now stand on the class standpoint taught by Chairman Mao to judge whether these works truly serve the people. From Chairman Mao's teachings, I understand that our performances should have content that reflects struggle and should serve the revolution in Japan."

Troupe leader Seisuke Shimizu also introduced some new developments in the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe since they began studying Chairman Mao's works. He said, "Now, our performers no longer watch boring programs on television."

Shimizu said: "Now, we are facing pressure from outside, but we will continue to study 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' to carry out our struggle. Our method of studying 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' is to learn, practice, learn again, and practice again."

For a long time, the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe has been fighting against the cultural invasion of American imperialism in Japan. In a country where bourgeois yellow culture is rampant, the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe has made outstanding contributions to defending national culture and to the revolutionization, nationalization, and popularization of ballet. In their struggle, they have studied Chairman Mao's works, drawing immense inspiration and strength from them.  (Photo attached)

### 日本松山芭蕾舞团热爱毛泽东思想  每周举行一次学习《毛主席语录》讲用会

    日本松山芭蕾舞团热爱毛泽东思想
    每周举行一次学习《毛主席语录》讲用会
    据新华社讯　在日本松山芭蕾舞团排练场隔壁的一个房间里，满满的坐了十几个人，每个人手中都捧着一本红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》。这是一次毛泽东思想学习会，也是一次学习《毛主席语录》讲用会。
    今年秋天，松山芭蕾舞代表团访问中国回国的时候，带回的最珍贵的礼物就是团员们人手一本的《毛主席语录》。回国之后他们在团长清水正夫的倡议下，成立了一个《毛主席语录》学习会，规定每星期用一个晚上开学习讲用会。
    讲用会开始了，大家高声朗读《毛主席语录》，在大家朗诵了《纪念白求恩》的一段以后，芭蕾舞团的工作人员垂口首先讲她学习《毛主席语录》的体会。垂口是在后台工作的，她什么杂事都做，芭蕾舞团两次访问中国时，她都留在东京。垂口说，我过去在工作中遇到了很多困难，那时，我只是苦恼，认为这种差使不好干。但是经过学习毛主席著作里白求恩的那种毫无自私自利的精神以后，我才认识到演员们在前台是为人民服务，我在后台同样也是为人民服务。我认为，毛泽东思想是改造思想的最有力的武器。
    在讲用会上一个女演员接着说：过去我看舞蹈、电影时，较多地看它们的技术。但是，最近通过学习毛泽东思想，看法变了，我开始能够站在毛主席教导的阶级立场上，看这些作品究竟是不是为人民服务的。我从毛主席著作的教导中认识到，我们演出的节目，应当具有斗争内容，应当是为日本的革命服务的。
    团长清水正夫也介绍了自从学习毛主席著作以来，松山芭蕾舞团出现的一些新气象。他说，我们的演员现在都不看电视里的无聊节目了。
    清水说：现在，我们受到来自外部的压力，但是我们要坚持学习《毛主席语录》来进行斗争。我们学习《毛主席语录》的方法是学习—实践—再学习—再实践。
    松山芭蕾舞团长期以来，对于美帝国主义向日本进行文化侵略进行了有力的斗争。在资产阶级的黄色文化大量泛滥的日本，松山芭蕾舞团为保卫民族文化，为芭蕾舞的革命化、民族化、大众化做了出色的贡献。他们在斗争中学习毛主席的著作，从中汲取了巨大的鼓舞和力量。（附图片）
