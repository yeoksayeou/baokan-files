Members of the Dongjiao People's Commune in Ningbo, Zhejiang, have responded enthusiastically to Comrade Lin Biao's call to take the study and application of Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. They have launched a mass movement and initiated a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Currently, every household in this commune has a portrait of Chairman Mao, works by Chairman Mao, and the "Little Red Book"; the walls inside and outside the village are inscribed with quotations from Chairman Mao; and by the fields and rivers, there are signs with quotations from Chairman Mao. They have established a steadfast study system: studying quotations, reciting quotations, and applying quotations. Each production brigade has formed a propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, using forms of political and ideological work that the masses find appealing.

Through the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits are flourishing in this commune. More and more members are dedicating themselves to the collective good and loving the collective. In the Maoyan Brigade, two female members who used to have conflicts have become reconciled through studying the "Three Articles"; both sides took the initiative to reflect, and "enemies" have become "friends." In the Dongfeng Brigade, many members, after studying Chairman Mao's works, have raised their consciousness and voluntarily swept away the "Four Olds": smashing ancestral tablets, cutting Buddhist rosaries, and burning various kitchen gods and idols.

    学语录  破“四旧”  立新风
    浙江宁波东郊人民公社广大社员，响应林彪同志把活学活用毛主席著作推向新阶段的号召，大搞群众运动，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。
    目前，这个公社家家户户都有毛主席像、毛主席著作、《毛主席语录》；村口村内的墙上，写着毛主席语录；田头河畔，插有毛主席语录牌。他们建立了雷打不散的学习制度，学语录，背语录，用语录。各生产大队都成立了毛泽东思想宣传队，采取群众喜闻乐见的形式，进行政治思想工作。
    通过活学活用毛主席著作，新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯，正在这个公社蓬勃兴起，一心为公、热爱集体的社员不断涌现。毛墺大队有两个女社员，过去闹不团结，成了“冤家”；通过“老三篇”的学习，双方都主动作了检查，“冤家”变成了“亲家”。东风大队不少社员学习了毛主席著作以后，觉悟提高了，自动起来横扫“四旧”：砸碎神主牌，扯断念佛珠，烧毁各种灶君、神像。
