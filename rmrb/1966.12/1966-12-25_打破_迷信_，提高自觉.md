Leaders of a certain unit in the People's Liberation Army, following Chairman Mao's instructions, have gone deep into the ranks, to the masses, and together with the soldiers, studied the "Three Articles," participated in the practice of serving the people, and engaged in self-reflection and the struggle against selfishness. They have focused on transforming their worldview, and have gained significant benefits. Their experiences are very enlightening to everyone.

The "Three Articles" are powerful ideological weapons for transforming one's worldview, and everyone should study them, at every level. This principle is not difficult to understand. However, when it comes to actual study, the enthusiasm and effectiveness vary greatly. Some can achieve 80 or 90 points, while others can only manage 10 or 20 points. The fundamental issue here is whether one has a correct self-assessment and a sense of self-awareness in learning and transformation. Some people have a bit of "superstition" about themselves: "After years of revolution, the issue of worldview has been basically resolved." "Old cadres, having a few old habits is inevitable." "No matter how well the soldiers study, they can't study better than the cadres." In the end, they issue a "graduation certificate" to themselves. What remains is only educating the masses and transforming the objective world. This is the fundamental reason why some leaders cannot study and apply the "Three Articles" effectively.

How to break this "superstition" and raise the self-awareness of learning and transformation? The most effective method is to follow the example of the leaders of a certain unit: go to the masses. The masses are the brightest mirror; from the masses, one can see one's true reflection, helping to excavate the filth deep within the soul. The masses are the best teachers; from the masses, one can learn what one lacks the most and find the true gaps in one's thinking. The masses have the keenest eyes; whether one studies deeply or not, and whether one applies what one has learned effectively, the masses will give a fair evaluation.

Chairman Mao has long taught us: go to the masses, learn from the masses, and always be a student of the masses. We should always remember this and honestly follow Chairman Mao's instructions.

    打破“迷信”，提高自觉
   立影
    解放军某部领导干部，遵照毛主席的教导，深入连队，到群众中去，和战士一起学习“老三篇”，一起参加为人民服务的实践，一起亮思想、斗私心，狠抓世界观的改造，获得了很大的益处。他们的经验，对人们很有启发。
    “老三篇”是改造世界观的强大思想武器，人人都要学，哪一级都要学。这个道理本来并不难懂。但是，真正学起来，劲头就大不一样，效果也有千差万别。有的可以打八、九十分，有的只能打一、二十分。这里，根本的问题是对自己有没有一个正确的估计，有没有学习和改造的自觉性。有些人对自己多少总有点“迷信”：“革命多年了，世界观问题基本上解决了。”“老干部，有点老毛病也难免。”“战士学得再好，还能比干部学得好？”说来说去，还是给自己发了“毕业证”。剩下的事情，就只有教育群众和改造客观世界了。这是一些领导干部“老三篇”学不进，用不好的根本原因。
    怎样打破这种“迷信”，提高学习和改造的自觉性呢？最有效的办法，就是像某部领导干部那样：到群众中去。群众是最亮的镜子，从群众那里，可以照见自己的真实面貌，帮助自己挖出灵魂深处的污垢；群众是最好的老师，从群众身上，可以学到自己最缺乏的东西，找到思想上真正的差距；群众的眼睛是最亮的，你学得深不深，用得好不好，群众都会给你做出公正的评价。
    毛主席早就教导我们：要到群众中去，向群众学习，永远做群众的小学生。我们应该永远记住这一点，老老实实地照毛主席的指示去做。
