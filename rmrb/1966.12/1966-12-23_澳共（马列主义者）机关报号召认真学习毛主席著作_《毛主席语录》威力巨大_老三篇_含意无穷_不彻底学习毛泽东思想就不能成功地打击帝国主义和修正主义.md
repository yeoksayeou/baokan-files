The organ of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) has called for serious study of Chairman Mao's works. The power of the "Little Red Book" is enormous, and the "Three Articles" are profound in meaning. Without thoroughly studying Mao Zedong Thought, it is impossible to successfully strike at imperialism and revisionism.

BEIJING, Dec. 22 (Xinhua) — According to a report from Melbourne, the latest issue of the organ of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists), *The Vanguard*, published an article calling on Australian communists and progressive people to seriously study the three articles by Comrade Mao Zedong, "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," as well as the "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

The article emphasizes that the "Three Articles" are profound in meaning. They point out that all those who aspire to become genuine Marxist-Leninists and communists can only be transformed through serving the people and through practice that casts aside all selfish individualism.

The article calls the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" a "powerful red book" and stresses that "the Mao Zedong Thought embodied in these quotations is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards its final collapse."

The article praises Mao Zedong's works, saying, "Every line in the works of Mao Zedong is filled with boundless wisdom; it is firm in principle and resolute in struggle. It has boundless trust in the people and clearly points out the path for the people to defeat the imperialist exploiters. Without thoroughly studying Mao Zedong Thought, it is impossible to successfully strike at contemporary imperialism and revisionism."

The article concludes by saying, "Today, the thought of Mao Zedong—the Lenin of our times—is becoming the common property of the people of the whole world. They are acting according to Mao Zedong Thought, inflicting heavy defeats on U.S. imperialism-led world imperialism and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet leadership. ... The people of the whole world, acting according to Mao Zedong Thought, will certainly carry the world revolution against imperialism to final victory."

    新华社二十二日讯　墨尔本消息：最近一期澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》发表文章，号召澳大利亚的共产主义者和进步人士认真学习毛泽东同志的三篇文章《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》和《毛主席语录》。
    文章强调说，“老三篇”的“含意无穷，它们指明，一切立志成为真正的马克思列宁主义者和共产党人的人们，只有通过为人民服务和抛开一切自私的个人主义的实践才能够得到改造”。
    文章把《毛主席语录》称为“具有巨大威力的红书”，并且强调说：“这些语录所体现的毛泽东思想，是当前帝国主义走向最后崩溃的时代的马克思列宁主义”。
    文章赞扬说：“毛泽东著作的每一行都有着无穷的智慧；有着坚定的原则和坚决的斗争。对人民有着无限的信任，并且明确指出了人民战胜帝国主义剥削者的道路。不彻底学习毛泽东思想，就不能成功地打击当代的帝国主义和修正主义。”
    文章最后说：“今天，毛泽东——我们时代的列宁——的思想正在成为全世界人民的财产。他们正在按照毛泽东思想行事，使美帝国主义为首的世界帝国主义和苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义遭受沉重失败。……全世界人民，按照毛泽东思想行事，定将把反对帝国主义的世界革命胜利地进行到底。”
