Hundreds of foreign experts working in Beijing held a meeting on the evening of the 21st to strongly denounce the U.S. imperialists' heinous crime of bombing Hanoi and to enthusiastically celebrate the sixth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

The meeting hall was adorned with portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh. The entire venue was filled with a strong atmosphere of internationalism.

The meeting passed a telegram congratulating the sixth anniversary of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The telegram condemned the world's number one enemy, U.S. imperialism, and its war crimes, as well as the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet leadership and other reactionaries who collude with the U.S. invaders to disrupt the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people with deceptive "peace talks." The telegram also expressed firm belief that all oppressed peoples of the world will unite to form a united front against U.S.-led imperialism and Soviet-led modern revisionism, and that all peoples of the world will march towards victory.

Belgian friend Parry presided over the meeting. In his speech, he emphasized that we must always remember Chairman Mao Zedong's call to continuously strengthen the broad united front against U.S. imperialism, excluding the revisionist traitors. During the meeting, South African friend Rand spoke, enthusiastically praising the indomitable and unyielding Vietnamese people for their steadfast revolutionary stance in their just struggle for national liberation. Vietnamese friend Huang Xi, amidst warm applause, was invited to speak. He expressed on behalf of all Vietnamese experts working in Beijing their sincere thanks to the friends from various countries present. He stated that the Vietnamese people are determined to carry the anti-American, national salvation struggle to the end. Brazilian friend Galiano enthusiastically praised the Vietnamese people's anti-American, national salvation war as an example for oppressed peoples and nations in their struggle for liberation. Japanese friend Suzuki Juzai, in his speech, said that to firmly fight against U.S. imperialism and achieve victory in the Vietnamese people's anti-American, national salvation war, we must resolutely fight against modern revisionism centered around the Soviet leadership. American friend Shu Ziyu, in his speech, said that the struggle of the Vietnamese people is the struggle of the American people. The American people face the same enemy as the Vietnamese people, and we together with the Vietnamese people demand, "U.S. imperialists out of Vietnam—get out now!"
