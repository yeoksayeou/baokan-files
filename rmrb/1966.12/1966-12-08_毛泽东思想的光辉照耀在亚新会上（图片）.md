The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shone at the first Asian New Forces Games. The great Mao Zedong Thought demonstrated its invincible power, inspiring athletes and sports workers from various Asian countries. They made outstanding contributions to the common cause of unity against imperialism.

Chinese athletes, carrying the deep affection of the Chinese people for the peoples of various Asian countries, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought at the first Asian New Forces Games. They emphasized politics, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works actively, and through friendly exchanges, visits, competitions, and sharing experiences, further enhanced their unity and friendship with athletes from other countries. Athletes from the frontlines of the anti-imperialist struggle and friendly countries expressed their sincere love and respect for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, with the most genuine words. They believed that Chairman Mao's works are the theoretical weapons for the anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples of various countries. They regarded the portraits and badges of Chairman Mao they received from Chinese athletes as the most precious gifts.

Chinese athletes regarded Chairman Mao's works as powerful ideological weapons for transforming their worldviews and scaling the heights of world sports.

Revolutionary peoples of various countries deeply love Chairman Mao. This is Nguyen Anh (right one), a Vietnamese shooter who has participated in shooting down American air pirates multiple times, and Manivong (right two), a Laotian shooter who participated in the anti-American struggle and was honorably wounded, gazing deeply at a colored portrait of Chairman Mao in military uniform reviewing the Red Guards on Tiananmen Gate, expressing their admiration and love for Chairman Mao.

Cambodian athletes deeply respect and love Chairman Mao. The image shows a Cambodian athlete cherishing the moment as a Chinese athlete pins a badge of Chairman Mao on his chest.

Yemeni volleyball player Hassan invited Chinese athletes to sing "Ode to the Motherland" with him in Chinese at a get-together. He praised Chinese friends nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought as the most humble and hardworking. He expressed his love for reading Chairman Mao's books, saying, "Chairman Mao's words are one hundred percent correct."

Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful revolutionary ideological weapon that enables revolutionary peoples to break through stormy waves, overcome all difficulties, and achieve final victory. A Japanese friend (left one) who firmly believes in this truth gave a passage from Chairman Mao's teachings—"Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory"—from his personally carried Japanese version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to a Chinese fencer at the first Asian New Forces Games fencing competition.

    毛泽东思想的光辉照耀在亚新会上
    在第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会上，伟大的毛泽东思想发挥了无往不胜的强大威力，鼓舞着亚洲各国运动员和体育工作者，为团结反帝的共同事业作出了卓越的贡献。
    我国运动员带着祖国人民对亚洲各国人民的深情厚谊，在首届亚新会上，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，通过联欢、访问、比赛和交流经验，更进一步地增进了与各国运动员的团结、友谊。来自反帝斗争前线和各友好国家的运动员，以最诚恳的心情和最真挚的语言，表达了他们对中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和崇敬。他们确信毛主席著作是各国人民反帝斗争的理论武器，他们把从中国运动员那里索取的毛主席像和毛主席像章看作是最珍贵的礼物。
    我国运动员把毛主席著作当作改造世界观和攀登世界体育运动高峰的强大思想武器。图为在这次运动会上打破举重世界纪录的陈满林（左）和萧明祥，赛前在宿舍里学习《为人民服务》。
    各国革命人民无限热爱毛主席。这是曾多次参加射击美国空中强盗的越南射击运动员陈英（右一）和曾参加反美斗争并光荣负伤的老挝射击运动员马尼冯（右二），深情地凝视着毛主席身穿军装，在天安门城楼检阅红卫兵的彩色像，表现出他们对毛主席的敬仰和热爱。
    柬埔寨运动员无限敬仰和热爱毛主席。图为一位柬埔寨运动员极为珍视地让中国运动员将毛主席像章给自己佩戴在胸前。
    也门排球运动员哈苏斯在一次联欢会上邀请中国运动员同他一起用中文唱了《歌唱祖国》。他赞扬在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的中国朋友最谦虚，最能吃苦。他表示最爱读毛主席的书，因为“毛主席的话百分之百地正确”。
    毛泽东思想是使革命人民冲破惊涛骇浪，克服种种困难，夺取最后胜利的最强大的革命思想武器。坚信这一真理的一位日本朋友（左一）在第一届亚新会击剑比赛场上，从自己随身携带的日文版《毛主席语录》上，选了一段毛主席的教导——“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”送给中国击剑运动员。
