Not fearing sacrifice is the primary condition to overcome all enemies

	Community member	Shi Chengxian

When we were digging a well in the Dabaotou Brigade, we planned to renovate an old well that was four zhang deep. If we dug deeper into this well, we could increase the water output and expand the irrigated area by more than 100 mu. However, renovating this well was very difficult. The well is narrow at the top and wide at the bottom. I wanted to go down and dig, but I was afraid of the danger. At this moment, Chairman Mao's words, "Not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties," came to my mind. I volunteered to go down into the well. After descending and digging for a short while, a piece of soil fell from the well wall and landed behind me. My heart was pounding, and I felt panicked, as if the well wall would really collapse. At this moment, I remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "To struggle means to make sacrifices. Death is a common occurrence. But we think of the people's interests, of the interests of the majority of the people. We die for the people, and our death is a worthy one." I thought: Zhang Zide burned wood for the people and sacrificed his life; Ouyang Hai gave his life to save the people's lives and property. Their deaths are heavier than Mount Tai. I am also a young person, why should I be so cowardly and afraid of death? Thus, my heart stopped pounding, my hands stopped trembling, and the fear of death was driven out of my mind. In this way, I and five other young people worked in the well for more than four hours, finally completing the renovation of the well.

Through this experience, I deeply felt that: to do revolution, one must not be afraid of death. If one is afraid of death, one cannot do revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us not to fear sacrifice. We must be like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Liu Yingjun, fearing neither hardship nor death. Not fearing sacrifice is the primary condition to defeat all enemies and to overcome all difficulties to achieve victory. Without the spirit of self-sacrifice, one will be crushed by the enemy and frightened by difficulties. Only by resolving not to fear death can one overcome all enemies and difficulties, achieving victory in the revolutionary cause.

### 不怕牺牲是压倒一切敌人的首要条件

    不怕牺牲是压倒一切敌人的首要条件	社员  师成先
    我们在大堡头大队打井的时候，计划改造一眼四丈深的旧井，这口井如果再往深挖一挖，就能增大出水量，扩大浇地面积一百多亩。但是，改造这眼井困难很大。井的上面小，下面大。我想下去挖，又怕出危险。这时，毛主席的“不怕牺牲，排除万难”八个大字，出现在我的脑子里，我就自告奋勇下到井里。下去打了不大一会，从井壁上塌下一片土来，落在我背后，我心里扑通扑通直跳，心一慌，好像是井壁真会塌下来。这时候，我又想起了毛主席的教导：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”我想：张思德为人民烧木炭，牺牲了自己的生命；欧阳海为了抢救人民的生命财产英勇献身，他们死得比泰山还重。我也是个年轻人，为什么就这样胆小怕死？于是，我心不跳了，手不慌了，怕死的思想从脑子里赶跑了。这样，我和五个青年，一直在井下打了四个多钟头，终于把这眼井改造成功了。
    通过这件事，我深深体会到：干革命就不能怕死，怕死就不能干革命。毛主席教导我们要不怕牺牲，我们就要像雷锋、王杰、刘英俊那样，一不怕苦，二不怕死。不怕牺牲，是战胜一切敌人的首要条件，也是排除万难去争取胜利的首要条件。没有牺牲自己的精神，就会被敌人压倒，被困难吓倒。只有树立了不怕死的决心，才能压倒一切敌人和一切困难，取得革命事业的胜利。
