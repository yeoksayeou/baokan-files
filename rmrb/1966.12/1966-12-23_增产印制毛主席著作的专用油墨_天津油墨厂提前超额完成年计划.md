The workers of the Tianjin Ink Factory, who are responsible for supplying special ink for printing Chairman Mao's works and portraits to more than twenty provinces and municipalities across the country, have, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. They have seized the revolution and promoted production, completing this year's production plan ahead of schedule and in excess of the target.

The workers of the Tianjin Ink Factory regard the production of special ink for printing Chairman Mao's works and portraits as a glorious political task and the greatest joy for the entire factory.

To accomplish this glorious political task, the broad masses of revolutionary workers have displayed a great revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to act, dare to break through, and dare to innovate. They have smashed the superstition of bourgeois technical "authorities" and broken through all old frameworks and foreign dogmas. Prussian blue is a pigment used in the production of ink, and the production process is relatively complex. The workers have broken through the old frameworks and improved the original process, increasing daily output from the original three batches to eight batches. This not only reduced the consumption of raw materials but also ensured quality.

    增产印制毛主席著作的专用油墨
    天津油墨厂提前超额完成年计划
    据新华社天津电　担负供应全国二十多个省市印制毛主席著作、毛主席像专用油墨生产任务的天津油墨厂广大革命职工，在无产阶级文化大革命中，活学活用毛主席著作，抓革命，促生产，提前全面超额完成了今年的生产计划。
    天津油墨厂的职工把增产印制毛主席著作、毛主席像专用油墨，看作是光荣的政治任务，看作是全厂最大的喜事。
    广大革命职工为了完成这项光荣的政治任务，发扬敢想、敢干、敢闯、敢创的大无畏的革命精神，打破对资产阶级技术“权威”的迷信，冲破一切旧框框，洋教条。铁蓝是制造油墨的一种颜料，生产过程比较复杂。工人们打破旧框框，改进了原来的工艺，使日产量由原来的三批提高到八批，不仅降低了原材料的消耗，而且保证了质量。
