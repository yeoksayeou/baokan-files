	Avoiding "Battle" and Seeking "Battle"
	Platoon Leader Chen Xuezheng

	I have been in the army for a few years. Many times I have been rated as an excellent soldier, joined the party, and was selected as an active member in the study of Chairman Mao's works in my company. These achievements and progress are the result of continuous ideological transformation under the Party's cultivation and education. However, I carried the burden of honor, fearing that if I made a mistake, it would affect my prestige and I would not be able to maintain my honor. Therefore, I dared not insist on finding contradictions and exposing problems, and when problems arose, I would avoid them. The more I feared making mistakes, the more mistakes I made, and at critical moments, I could not stand firm. Last spring, when my term of service was up, the organization, based on work needs, asked me to continue serving. I was not very willing, and my work lacked enthusiasm. The deputy company commander talked to me, using battle as an analogy, pointing out to me: Previously, you fought bravely and dared to engage the "enemy" in close combat, winning victories; but now you stay in the trenches without wanting to attack, having only defensive capabilities and no offensive power. The more you try to avoid battle, the more you get hit. If you continue like this, a hero might become a failure.

	After studying "On Contradiction," and reflecting on Chairman Mao's teachings, I was greatly shaken. Originally, being advanced or backward is not fixed, and under certain conditions, they can transform into each other. This condition mainly depends on one's attitude towards ideological transformation—whether it is active offense or passive avoidance.

	Learning from experience, under the guidance of leaders and comrades, I took the initiative to charge into battle. Not only did I actively engage when problems came to me, but I also proactively sought out problems when I felt there were none. After fighting a few rounds of proactive battles, the stronghold of advanced thinking gradually solidified. This spring, before the old soldiers retired, I took the initiative to struggle with my own active thoughts, gained the initiative, and happily followed the revolutionary needs to continue serving and extend my service. This sweet experience further educated me: Advanced thinking can only develop by constantly struggling with backward thinking. The battle of ideas can never hang up a "battle avoidance" sign; only by frequently issuing "battle challenges" and continuously promoting the transformation of the old aspects within things from large to small, and the new aspects from small to large, can one always move forward.

    免“战”和求“战”
    班长　陈学政
    我入伍几年，好多次被评为五好战士，入了党，还被选为连里学习毛主席著作积极分子。这些成绩和进步，本来是在党的培养教育下不断改造思想的结果。但是我却背上了荣誉的包袱，害怕出了问题会影响自己的威信，保持不了荣誉。因而不敢坚持找矛盾，揭盖子，有了问题就回避。谁知越害怕出问题，就越出问题，节骨眼上就过不了硬。去年春天服役期满的时候，组织上根据工作需要让我继续留队，我就不大乐意，工作就打不起精神。副连长找我谈话，拿打仗做比方，向我指出：以前你猛打猛冲，敢和“敌人”刺刀见红，打了胜仗；可现在呆在阵地里不想出击，只有招架之功，没有还枪之力，越想免战越是挨打，这样下去，闯将可能变为败将。
    学了《矛盾论》，想想毛主席的教导，自己震动很大。原来，先进和后进，不是一成不变的，在一定的条件下会互相转化。这个条件，主要是自己对思想改造采取什么态度，是积极进攻呢，还是消极逃避。
    吃一堑，长一智。在领导和同志们的帮助下，我拍马上阵。不仅是问题找上门来的时候积极应战，而且在感到“没啥问题”的时候也主动找问题。这样打了几个回合的主动仗，先进思想的阵地逐步巩固。今年春天老战士退伍以前，我就抓了自己的活思想进行斗争，取得了主动权，愉快地服从了革命需要，继续留队超期服役。这个甜头进一步教育了我：先进思想只有不断跟后进思想斗争才能发展。打思想仗永远挂不得“免战牌”，只有经常下“求战书”，不断促进事物内部旧的方面由大变小，新的方面由小变大，才能永远前进。
