“Determine to overcome all difficulties, fear no sacrifice, and strive for victory.”

Macau compatriots resolutely declare to carry the struggle against violence to the end

Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots angrily denounce the heinous crimes of Portuguese imperialists

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 8th: In recent days, compatriots from various circles in Macau and Hong Kong have written letters to the *Macau Daily* and several newspapers in Hong Kong, including the *Wen Wei Po* and *Ta Kung Pao*, expressing their indignation and denouncing the heinous crimes of the Portuguese imperialists in Macau. Compatriots in Macau and Hong Kong resolutely declare: They will definitely carry the struggle against violence to the end. Hong Kong compatriots firmly support the just struggle of Macau compatriots and will not rest until complete victory is achieved.

By December 7th, just a few newspapers in Macau and Hong Kong had received more than 200 letters of protest, both collectively and individually. Some students wrote in their letters, “After the Portuguese imperialists created the bloodshed in Corvo, they dared to ignore the protests and demands of Macau compatriots, further locking doors and beating patriotic teachers and students, repeatedly shooting and killing and injuring our compatriots. These fascist atrocities have aroused our great anger. Blood debts must be repaid!” Some teachers from Macau pointed out in their letters: “The Portuguese imperialists in Macau have premeditated, organized, and planned to kill Macau Chinese compatriots, which is a product of Portuguese imperialism following the anti-China policy of American imperialism. We warn Caldeira: You must take full responsibility.”

Many readers who witnessed the Portuguese imperialists beating and killing our compatriots revealed in their letters: These murderers, on the nights of the 3rd and 4th, used armored cars to lead the way, machine-gunned the crowd, and then used trucks following behind to take away the bodies and injured, and secretly cleaned the bloodstains during the curfew when there were no pedestrians, and blocked the ambulances of Macau's Kiang Wu Hospital, attempting to destroy the evidence. However, the evidence cannot be destroyed; many streets are still stained with blood and riddled with bullet holes; the evidence also cannot be reduced: How many Macau compatriots were killed, they must confess in truth.

These letters also praised with great admiration the moving deeds of Macau compatriots in their struggle against violence, showing courage and tenacity, and dying without surrender. Readers' letters mentioned that a young man, surrounded by several fully armed Portuguese soldiers, showed no fear, fought bravely, and struggled with these beasts to his last breath. A 17-year-old student, Xu Wen'an, was seriously injured by a bullet and fainted, but when he briefly regained consciousness in the hospital, he used his last moments to shout, “Oppose the fascist atrocities of the Portuguese!” A compatriot who was severely beaten and injured recalled the teachings of Chairman Mao and firmly declared: “Determine to overcome all difficulties, fear no sacrifice, and strive for victory.”

Many Macau compatriots warned the Portuguese imperialists in their letters to the *Macau Daily*: “You think you can scare Macau compatriots with tear gas, machine guns, and rifles? That is a delusion. We have a powerful socialist motherland supporting us, and we have the united 200,000 Chinese compatriots in Macau. Let you tremble!” “You dare to make enemies of the Chinese people? That is too arrogant. We do not even fear the most vicious American imperialism, let alone a few flies that hit the wall.”

The entire staff of Macau's Kiang Wu Hospital, who bravely rescued the injured compatriots, warned the Portuguese authorities on December 7th: “You must bear full responsibility for the blood debts you owe, and there will be no bargaining. The dignity of the Chinese people cannot be insulted, and the dignity of the Chinese people cannot be violated. We, all the compatriots in Macau, will not rest until we achieve complete victory! This is our will! This is our resolve!”

All the letters sent to the newspapers sternly pointed out that the Portuguese authorities must immediately fully implement the just demands of Macau compatriots, severely punish the main culprit, Colonel F. J. L. Correia, release all compatriots arrested in the fascist bloody violence, publish the full number of casualties, publicly apologize to the victims and their families, and compensate for all losses.

    “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    澳门同胞表示坚决把抗暴斗争进行到底
    港九同胞愤怒声讨澳葡帝国主义者的滔天罪行
    新华社香港八日电  连日来，澳门和港九各界同胞纷纷向《澳门日报》和香港《文汇报》、《大公报》等几家报纸写信，同仇敌忾，愤怒声讨澳门葡萄牙帝国主义者杀害澳门同胞的滔天罪行。澳门和香港同胞坚决表示：一定要把抗暴斗争进行到底，香港同胞坚决支持澳门同胞的正义斗争，不获全胜，决不罢休。
    截至七日，仅澳门和香港的几家报纸就收到了二百多封以集体和个人名义写来的抗议信。一些学生在信中说，“澳葡帝国主义在制造凼仔血案后，竟敢不顾澳门同胞的抗议和要求，更进一步关门毒打爱国师生，一再开枪打死打伤我同胞，这些法西斯暴行，激起了我们极大的愤怒，血债一定要偿还！”一些澳门教师在信中指出：“澳门葡萄牙帝国主义者有预谋、有组织、有计划地杀害澳门中国同胞，是葡萄牙帝国主义追随美帝国主义反华政策的产物，我们要警告嘉乐庇，你必须负起全责。”
    许多亲眼见到葡萄牙帝国主义者毒打和杀害我同胞的读者在信中揭露说：这些凶手在三日晚上和四日行凶的时候，以装甲车开道，用机关枪扫射人群，由紧跟在后面的卡车把尸体和伤者载走，又在宵禁没有行人的时候偷偷地清洗血迹，并拦阻澳门镜湖医院的救护车，妄图消灭罪证。但是，罪证是消灭不了的，许多街道仍然是血迹斑斑，弹孔累累；罪证也绝对减轻不了的，杀害了多少澳门同胞，就得要如实认罪。
    这些来信还以无比敬佩的心情赞扬澳门同胞在抗暴斗争中英勇顽强、至死不屈的动人事迹。读者的来信谈到，一位青年被几个全副武装的葡萄牙兽兵包围着，他毫无惧色，斗志昂扬，赤手空拳和这些兽兵搏斗到最后一口气。一位十七岁的学生许文安，中弹受重伤而昏迷，当他在医院中一度苏醒过来的时候，用他生命的最后一刻，高呼：“反对澳葡法西斯的暴行！”一位被毒打身受重伤的爱国同胞想起毛主席的教导，坚定地表示：一定要“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    许多澳门同胞在写给《澳门日报》的信中警告澳门葡萄牙帝国主义者：“你们别以为随便用催泪瓦斯弹、机枪、步枪就可以把澳门同胞吓住，这是妄想。我们有强大的社会主义祖国支持着，有团结的澳门二十多万中国同胞，让你们发抖吧！”“你们胆敢与中国人民为敌，太不自量力了。我们连最凶恶的美帝国主义都不放在眼内，还怕你们几个碰壁的苍蝇？”
    英勇抢救受伤同胞的澳门镜湖医院全体职工七日警告澳葡当局：“你们欠下的血债一定要全部来承担责任，决不许讨价还价，中国人民不可侮，中国人民的尊严决不许侵犯，我们全澳同胞不获全胜，决不罢休！这就是我们的意志！这就是我们的决心！”
    所有写给报纸的信都严正指出，澳葡当局必须立即全部实现澳门同胞的严正要求，严惩主凶傅基利，全部释放在法西斯血腥暴行中被捕的我同胞，公布全部伤亡数字，向受害同胞和他们的家属公开赔罪认错，赔偿一切损失。
