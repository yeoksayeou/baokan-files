At the First Asian Games of New Emerging Forces, brimming with a new atmosphere of unity against imperialism and mutual assistance, the warm scenes of Asian athletes expressing their love for our great leader Chairman Mao were everywhere to be seen. Their sincere words of admiration for Chairman Mao and praise for Mao Zedong Thought, their enthusiastic shouts of "Long Live Chairman Mao!" in Chinese, and their passionate singing of songs in praise of Chairman Mao have deeply moved us and will forever be etched in our memories.

"Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Years!"

At a friendship gathering between Chinese athletes and athletes from Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon, the Arab friends expressed their boundless love and respect for our great leader Chairman Mao. An Iraqi friend said, "Mao Zedong is a great revolutionary leader, beloved by people all over the world." A Palestinian friend said, "Chairman Mao Zedong is a great revolutionary teacher. His works have given the fighting Palestinian people an invaluable strength. All Palestinian people respect Mao Zedong and love the Chinese people!" A Syrian friend enthusiastically praised the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought and studied "Quotations from Chairman Mao" together with Chinese athletes. The Yemeni friends also expressed their love for Chairman Mao at the gathering.

A Palestinian friend learned from the Chinese table tennis player Zhuang Zedong how to say "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live Chinese-Arab People's Friendship!" "Down with American Imperialism!" and other slogans in Chinese, and repeatedly led everyone in shouting these slogans at the gathering. He also sang a Chinese song in praise of Chairman Mao, "The East Is Red." At the end of the gathering, he led everyone in shouting for a long time, "Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Years!"

Similar touching scenes also occurred at the friendship gatherings between Chinese athletes and athletes from Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Japan. The friends from these countries enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao and sang "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" with great fervor, expressing their love for Chairman Mao.

The Most Precious Gift

During these days of friendly interaction, when many athletes from other countries met with Chinese athletes, the most precious gift they hoped to receive was a work by Chairman Mao, a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," a Chairman Mao badge, or a portrait of Chairman Mao. Palestinian athletes from the front lines of the struggle against American imperialism and its lackey Israel wore Chairman Mao badges on their chests. They asked Chinese athletes for works by Chairman Mao and portraits of Chairman Mao, with some requesting multiple sets of Chairman Mao's works and many portraits of Chairman Mao. They said these were the most precious gifts to bring back to their comrades at home.

The foreign friends' eager desire to obtain what they considered the most precious gift deeply moved everyone. Once, while a reporter was conducting interviews at the track and field venue, a dark-skinned, sturdy Arab friend approached with a smile. He looked at the reporter's Chairman Mao badge and, with a thumbs up, excitedly said, "You must be from the land of Mao Zedong." He said he was an athlete from Iraq and asked the reporter if he could give him the Chairman Mao badge. When the reporter took off the shiny Chairman Mao badge and pinned it on his chest, he was overjoyed. The Iraqi friend told the reporter, "Mao Zedong is an outstanding and great leader. His theory that 'imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers' has given great encouragement to oppressed people all over the world! The Iraqi people respect Chairman Mao and love the Chinese people led by Chairman Mao."

Chairman Mao Has Given Us Great Support

Asian athletes love Chairman Mao so much because they know from their struggles that Chairman Mao always stands on the side of the oppressed people; Chairman Mao most resolutely supports the just struggle of the Asian people against imperialism and old and new colonialism; Chairman Mao also deeply cares about the Asian people's sincere wish to independently develop their own countries. A Palestinian friend said, "In the struggle against American imperialism and its lackey Israel, the Palestinian people will never forget the great support given by the Chinese people led by Chairman Mao. The works of Mao Zedong have given us the courage, strength, and confidence to fight." A Yemeni volleyball player was very enthusiastic towards Chinese friends. He told Chinese friends that China's help to Yemen was immense, and the work of Chinese experts helping to build Yemen was outstanding. The Yemeni people saw the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought from the Chinese experts. He also expressed his love for reading Chairman Mao's works because "Chairman Mao's words are one hundred percent correct."

Mao Zedong's Works Are Treasure Books of Revolution

Athletes from various parts of Asia, many of whom have read Chairman Mao's books, understand that Chairman Mao's works are treasure books guiding the people of the world to carry out revolutionary struggles and strive for liberation. The head of the Lao People's Democratic Republic's sports delegation, Fonsei Santavasi, told a reporter when introducing the achievements of Lao shooters, "We demand that athletes on the competition field, just like on the battlefield, display the spirit of fighting American aggressors, as Chairman Mao said: 'With firm resolve, fearing neither sacrifice nor difficulty, overcoming all hardships, and striving for victory.' A Vietnamese friend said, 'The power of the people is invincible. It is by applying Chairman Mao's theory of people's war that we Vietnamese brothers in the south are striking at American imperialism. We will surely achieve the final victory.'

Inside and outside the sports venues, one often sees foreign friends reading Chairman Mao's works. A Japanese athlete obtained a Japanese version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from a Chinese friend and immediately found the Chinese gymnastics judge Men Xiaomin to read it together. They first read several passages from "Patriotism and Internationalism" together. He expressed that Chairman Mao's idea of uniting the people of the world to form the broadest anti-American united front is very wise and wrote down "Mao Zedong" and "Great Chinese People" on a piece of paper. Then, they turned to the section "Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers" and read it together. The Japanese athlete drew a picture of a paper tiger on a piece of paper to express his contempt for American imperialism.

Once, several Chinese athletes were studying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" together on the sports field, and several Cambodian friends immediately gathered around, asking for a translation of the content and taking out notebooks to write down passages such as "With firm resolve, fearing neither sacrifice nor difficulty, overcoming all hardships, and striving for victory" and "Our comrades must see achievements and light in times of difficulty, must see courage in times of difficulty."

    毛泽东思想光芒普照深入人心
    亚洲各国运动员无限敬仰毛主席
    在洋溢着团结反帝、友爱互助新风气的第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会上，亚洲各国体育界朋友热爱我们伟大领袖毛主席的生动的场面和情景，到处都可以看到。他们敬仰毛主席、赞扬毛泽东思想的真挚语言，用中国话高呼“毛泽东万岁！”的欢呼声，以及他们热情歌颂毛主席的嘹亮的歌声，一直深深地激动着我们，使我们永远不能忘怀。
      “毛泽东万岁！万万岁！”
    在中国运动员同来自巴勒斯坦、叙利亚、伊拉克、也门和黎巴嫩等国家和地区的运动员的友谊联欢会上，阿拉伯朋友表达了对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱和崇敬。一位伊拉克朋友说：毛泽东是伟大的革命领袖，他受到全世界人民的爱戴。一位巴勒斯坦朋友说：“毛泽东主席是伟大的革命导师，他的著作给战斗的巴勒斯坦人民以不可估价的力量，全体巴勒斯坦人民都敬仰毛泽东，热爱中国人民！”一位叙利亚朋友热情赞扬毛泽东思想的伟大，并和中国运动员一块学习《毛主席语录》。也门朋友也在会上表达了也门人民热爱毛主席的心情。
    一位巴勒斯坦朋友从中国乒乓球运动员庄则栋那里学会用中国话说“毛泽东万岁！”“中国—阿拉伯人民友好万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义！”等口号，就一再带领大家在联欢会上高呼这些口号。他还歌唱了歌颂毛主席的中国歌曲《东方红》。在联欢会结束时，他带领着大家长时间地欢呼：“毛泽东万岁！万万岁！”
    同样的感人情景，也出现在中国运动员同柬埔寨、越南、老挝和日本等国家体育界朋友的联欢会上。这些国家的朋友热情地赞扬毛主席，并且充满激情地高唱《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲，表达了他们对毛主席的敬爱。
            最珍贵的礼物
    在这些友好相处的日子里，当许多国家的运动员同中国运动员见面时，他们希望得到的最珍贵的礼物就是一部毛主席著作、一本《毛主席语录》、一枚毛主席像章，或者一幅毛主席像。来自反对美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的斗争前线的巴勒斯坦运动员们胸前佩着毛主席像章。他们向中国运动员索取毛主席著作和毛主席像，有的人要了好几套毛主席著作，好多张毛主席像。他们说：这是他们带给国内的战友们的最珍贵的礼物。
    外国朋友们希望获得他们心目中最珍贵的礼物的热切心情，使人十分感动。有一次，记者正在田径场上进行采访活动，忽然一位面孔晒得黝黑、身体健壮的阿拉伯朋友笑着迎面走来。他注视着记者胸前的毛主席像章，伸出大拇指兴奋地说：“你一定是来自毛泽东的国度。”他说，他是伊拉克的运动员，并问记者能不能把这枚毛主席像章送给他。当记者把金光闪闪的毛主席像章摘下来戴在他的胸前时，他高兴极了。这位伊拉克朋友对记者说：“毛泽东是一位杰出而伟大的领袖，他提出的‘帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎’的理论，给了全世界被压迫人民以巨大的鼓舞！我们伊拉克人民尊敬毛泽东主席，热爱毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民。”
    毛主席给了我们巨大的支持
    亚洲体育界朋友这样热爱毛主席，是因为他们从斗争实践中知道，毛主席永远站在被压迫人民的一边；毛主席最坚决地支持亚洲各国人民反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义的正义斗争；毛主席也最关心亚洲人民独立自主地发展自己的国家的深切愿望。一位巴勒斯坦朋友说：“在同美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的斗争中，巴勒斯坦人民永远忘不了毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民所给予我们的巨大支持，毛泽东的著作给了我们以战斗的勇气、力量和信心。”也门一位排球队员对中国朋友非常热情。他告诉中国朋友说，中国给也门的帮助太大了，帮助也门建设的中国专家的工作很出色，也门人民从中国专家的身上，看到了毛泽东思想的伟大。他还表示他最喜欢读毛主席的著作，因为“毛主席的话百分之百的正确”。
      毛主席著作是革命的宝书
    来自亚洲各地的体育界朋友，不少人读过毛主席的书，他们懂得，毛主席的著作，是指导全世界人民进行革命斗争、争取解放的宝书。老挝体育代表团团长丰赛·桑塔瓦西在向记者介绍老挝射击运动员的成就时说：我们要求运动员在比赛场上也要和在战场上一样，发挥打美国侵略者的精神，像毛主席所说的：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”一位越南朋友说：“人民的力量是无敌的，我们越南南方兄弟正是运用毛主席关于人民战争的理论，打击美帝国主义。我们一定会取得最后胜利。”
    在运动场内外，人们常常可以看到外国朋友在阅读毛主席著作。一位日本运动员从中国朋友那里得到一本日文版的《毛主席语录》，就立即找到中国体操运动裁判门晓敏，一起阅读起来。他们首先一起阅读了《爱国主义和国际主义》中的几段语录。他表示，毛主席提出的全世界人民团结起来结成最广泛的反美统一战线的思想是非常英明的，并在纸片上写下：“毛泽东”和“中国人民伟大”几个字。接着，他们又一起翻开《帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎》这一节阅读起来，这位日本运动员在纸片上画了一个纸老虎的形象来表达他对美帝国主义的蔑视。
    有一次几个中国运动员在运动场上一起学习《毛主席语录》，几位柬埔寨朋友立刻围拢来，要求翻译把内容讲给他们听，并且拿出本子来，把“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”和“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”等语录都记了下来。
              ×　×　×
    亚洲体育健儿热爱毛主席的深厚感情，充分说明了，我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席受到了全世界人民无限的尊敬和爱戴，也充分显示了伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想光芒万丈，普照全世界！
