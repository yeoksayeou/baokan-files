The Soviet revisionist leadership clique has recently become even more brazen in its collusion with U.S. imperialism, carrying out counter-revolutionary joint actions. Such actions by the Soviet revisionists have made their counter-revolutionary faces even more apparent to the people of the world.

Viciously Collaborating to Oppose China

U.S. imperialism seeks to dominate the world. The Soviet revisionists want to "cooperate with the U.S. to rule the world." China firmly opposes U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism, and firmly supports the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries. Therefore, both the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists regard revolutionary China as a thorn in their side and are collaborating to oppose China.

After World War II, the U.S. has always placed its global strategic focus on Europe. Now, the Soviet revisionists are implementing a policy of capitulation, so the U.S. has shifted its global strategic focus to Asia, making China its primary enemy. The Soviet revisionists are actively cooperating, working to "ease" the situation in Europe, allowing the U.S. to freely transfer troops from Europe to Asia.

The Soviet revisionists are also actively building relationships with the U.S.'s gang of lackeys, helping the U.S. establish a "surrounding ring" against China. The Soviet revisionists collude with the Indian reactionaries against China, desperately wooing the Japanese reactionaries, and frequently sit with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the South Korean puppets, and others in international conferences. Not long ago, the U.S. convened a meeting of its lackeys in Manila to discuss expanding the war in Vietnam, shouting slogans against China; the Soviet revisionists also held an anti-China meeting in Moscow, coordinating with the U.S.

China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has frightened the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists. They are in cahoots, viciously slandering and attacking our Cultural Revolution. Recently, the Soviet newspaper *Pravda* published an article savagely attacking our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, and openly supporting a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in our country. The Soviet revisionists even distributed this malicious article at the United Nations, attempting to incite a new wave of anti-China sentiment.

Chairman Mao said, "If the enemy vigorously opposes us, defames us as worthless, then it is even better, proving that we have not only drawn a clear line with the enemy but also that our work has achieved great success." The more viciously the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists oppose us, the more we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the proletarian revolutionary cause through to the end.

Conspiring to Extinguish the Anti-U.S. Struggle in Vietnam

In addition to colluding with U.S. imperialism to intensify their opposition to China, the Soviet revisionists are also actively serving U.S. aggression, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. struggle.

Regarding the struggle of the Vietnamese people, the Soviet revisionists have adopted a two-faced tactic of feigning support while actually betraying. They pretend to "aid" the Vietnamese people but actually seek to control the Vietnamese people's struggle, bringing the Vietnamese issue into the "U.S.-Soviet cooperation" track, using it as a bargaining chip in their political dealings with the U.S. On one hand, they indulge the U.S. in transferring troops from Europe to Vietnam to expand the war of aggression; on the other hand, they closely coordinate with and eagerly assist every trick of the U.S.'s "peace talks" ploy.

Recently, the U.S. has been pushing the "bombing halt to lure peace" scheme, and the Soviet revisionists have actively coordinated. Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko used the opportunity of a United Nations meeting to hold secret talks with U.S. President Johnson and others. The U.S. also sent the foreign ministers of Canada and Britain to Moscow in succession to discuss. The issue of "peace talks" in Vietnam was a major content of these secret talks. The Soviet revisionists now do not even mention the withdrawal of U.S. invading troops from Vietnam but express that as long as the U.S. stops bombing North Vietnam, there is a way to "peace talks." To force the Vietnamese people to accept "peace talks," the Soviet revisionists conspire to control Vietnam through so-called "joint aid to Vietnam" and spread many rumors, slandering China and sowing discord between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples.

While pretending to support the Vietnamese people, the Soviet revisionists openly tell the U.S. that U.S. aggression against Vietnam does not hinder "U.S.-Soviet cooperation." Therefore, recently, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have already made several political deals and signed several agreements. The U.S. is also desperately wooing the Soviet revisionists. Johnson recently publicly proposed to implement a "bridge-building" policy towards the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to promote the "wind of change" in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are becoming more and more intimate in their anti-communist and anti-people actions.

The Soviet revisionists' attitude towards the Vietnamese issue once again proves that they are the U.S.'s number one accomplice, traitors who betray the interests of the revolutionary people of the world and sabotage national liberation movements. To oppose U.S. imperialism, we must also oppose Soviet revisionism.

All Counter-Revolutionary Conspiracies Will Be Foiled

Chairman Mao has said that the current situation in the world is one where the two great forces of revolution and counter-revolution are engaged in their final struggle. These two great forces have raised two great banners: one is the red banner of revolution, calling on all oppressed classes of the world to rally under its banner; the other is the white banner of counter-revolution, calling on all counter-revolutionaries of the world to rally under its banner.

The Soviet revisionists' open intensification of collusion with U.S. imperialism precisely shows that both sides are having an increasingly difficult time. The U.S. wants the Soviet revisionists to help it. The Soviet revisionists are thus increasingly tearing off their two-faced masks, openly standing under the U.S.'s white banner of counter-revolution. Now, the line between revolution and counter-revolution in the world is becoming clearer. This is a good thing for the revolutionary people of the world.

Our era is one where imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards worldwide victory. The U.S. and the Soviet Union cannot help each other. The U.S.-Soviet dream of "cooperating to rule the world" will never be realized. The U.S. and the Soviet Union collude, attempting to isolate and strike China, extinguish the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression, and extinguish the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries. All these conspiracies will suffer complete failure. The people of the world will carry out the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism to the end, achieving the great victory of the international proletarian and world people's revolutionary cause.

### 苏美勾结大搞反革命联合行动

    苏美勾结大搞反革命联合行动
    苏联修正主义领导集团最近更加露骨地同美帝国主义勾结，大搞反革命联合行动。苏修的这种做法，使它在世界人民面前，更加清楚地暴露了自己的反革命嘴脸。
    穷凶极恶合伙反对中国
    美帝要独霸世界。苏修要搞“苏美合作主宰世界”。中国坚决反对美帝国主义和现代修正主义，坚决支持各国人民的革命斗争。因此，美帝和苏修都把革命的中国当作眼中钉，合伙反对中国。
    第二次世界大战以后，美帝一向把它的全球战略重心放在欧洲。现在，苏修执行了投降主义政策，美帝就把全球战略重心挪到亚洲来，把中国当作主要敌人。苏修积极进行配合，大搞“缓和”欧洲局势，让美帝放手从欧洲调兵到亚洲来。
    苏修还同美帝的一伙帮凶走狗大拉关系，帮着美帝建立对中国的“包围圈”。苏修联合印度反动派反华，拚命拉拢日本反动派，还经常同蒋匪帮、南朝鲜傀儡等坐在一起开国际会议。不久前，美帝在马尼拉召集帮凶走狗开会商量扩大侵越战争，叫嚣反华；苏修也在莫斯科开反华会议，同美帝互相策应。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命吓坏了美帝和苏修。它们一鼻孔出气，拚命诽谤和攻击我国文化大革命。最近苏联《真理报》还发表文章，猖狂地攻击我们伟大的领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，并且公然地给我国一小撮反革命修正主义分子撑腰打气。苏修甚至把这篇恶毒的文章拿到联合国里去散发，想要掀起一个新的反华高潮。
    毛主席说，“如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”美帝苏修越是穷凶极恶地反对我们，我们就越是要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把无产阶级的革命事业进行到底。
    密谋策划扑灭越南抗美斗争
    苏修除了同美帝勾结加紧反华以外，还积极为美帝侵略战争效劳，妄想扑灭越南人民的抗美斗争烈火。
    对越南人民的斗争，苏修采取了假支持，真出卖的两面手法。它假装“援助”越南人民，实际上是要乘机控制越南人民的斗争，把越南问题纳入“美苏合作”的轨道，当作它同美帝做政治买卖的一笔资本。它一方面纵容美帝从欧洲调兵到越南，来扩大侵略战争；另一方面对美帝“和谈”阴谋的每一个花招，都紧紧配合，竭力帮忙。
    最近，美帝大搞“停炸诱和”的阴谋，苏修又积极配合。苏修外交部长葛罗米柯利用联合国开会的机会，同美帝头子约翰逊等密谈。美帝又派了加拿大和英国的外交部长先后到莫斯科去商量。越南“和谈”问题是这些密谈的一个主要内容。苏修现在根本不谈要美国侵略军撤出越南，却表示只要美帝停止轰炸越南北方，“和谈”就有办法。为了强迫越南人民接受“和谈”，苏修阴谋用所谓“联合援越”来控制越南，并且散布许多谣言，诬蔑中国，挑拨中越人民的战斗团结。
    苏修一面假装支持越南人民，一面却公开对美帝说，美国侵略越南并不妨碍美苏的“合作”。因此，最近美苏两国已经做成了不少政治交易，签订了好几个协定。美帝也拚命拉拢苏修。约翰逊最近公开提出要对苏联东欧实行“搭桥”政策，来促进苏联东欧的“改变之风”。美帝苏修在反共反人民上一搭一档，越来越亲热了。
    苏修在越南问题上的态度，又一次证明它是美帝的头号帮凶，是出卖全世界革命人民利益、破坏民族解放运动的无耻叛徒。我们要反对美帝，就一定也要反对苏修。
    一切反革命阴谋通通要破产
    毛主席说过，现在世界上的局面，是革命和反革命两大势力作最后斗争的局面。这两大势力竖起了两面大旗：一面是红色的革命的大旗，号召全世界一切被压迫阶级集合于其旗帜之下；一面是白色的反革命的大旗，号召全世界一切反革命分子集合于其旗帜之下。
    苏修同美帝公开加紧勾结，恰恰说明它们两家日子都越来越难过。美帝要苏修帮它的忙。苏修也就越来越撕开了它两面派的假面具，公开站到了美帝的反革命的白旗下面。现在，世界上革命和反革命的界线划分得越来越清楚。这对于全世界革命人民来说，这是一件好事。
    我们的时代，是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代。美帝苏修，谁也帮不了谁的忙。美苏合作主宰世界的迷梦，是永远实现不了的。美苏勾结起来，妄想孤立和打击中国，扑灭越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争，扑灭世界各国人民的革命斗争，这一切阴谋，通通要遭到彻底的失败。全世界人民将要把反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底，取得国际无产阶级和世界人民革命事业的伟大胜利。
