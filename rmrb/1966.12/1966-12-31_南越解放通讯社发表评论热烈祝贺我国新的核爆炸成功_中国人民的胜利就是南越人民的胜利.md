The Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam published a commentary on December 29 warmly congratulating the great victory of China's successful conduct of another nuclear explosion. The commentary pointed out that China's successful conduct of another nuclear explosion demonstrates the self-reliance, hard work, and great creativity of the 700 million brothers of the Chinese people under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao. This victory has greatly encouraged all revolutionary people of the world and has caused the war-mongering clique of the United States to be extremely panicked.

The commentary said that in the face of the U.S. imperialists' rampant nuclear blackmail and their unceasing pursuit of aggression and war policies, the Chinese people's possession of increasingly perfect nuclear weapons is a guarantee of China's national defense and a major contribution to the struggle to defend peace in Asia and the world.

The commentary said that the people of South Vietnam regard every victory achieved by the brotherly Chinese people as their own victory and see it as a great encouragement and strong support for the struggle of the people of South Vietnam.
