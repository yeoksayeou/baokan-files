Fujian Province and Sanming City held a rally to warmly welcome the second batch of overseas Chinese returning from Indonesia. The returning overseas Chinese unanimously expressed their determination to redouble their efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to build Fujian Province, which is on the frontline of the country's coastal defense, into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Xinhua News Agency, Sanming, December 13th: The second batch of Indonesian overseas Chinese who returned on the Guanghua Ship participated in a grand welcome rally held by the people of Fujian Province and Sanming City today. At the rally, they unanimously expressed their determination to redouble their efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to build Fujian Province, which is on the frontline of the country's coastal defense, into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The overseas Chinese, wearing Chairman Mao's badges and waving copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sang revolutionary songs such as "The East Is Red" and "The Sea Voyage Relies on the Helm," and entered the venue to thunderous applause. Together with their fellow countrymen, they repeatedly shouted in excitement: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!"

The welcome rally began with the music of "The East Is Red." Leaders from Fujian Province and Sanming City, as well as representatives from workers, peasants, and Red Guards, spoke at the rally, extending a warm welcome to the patriotic overseas Chinese who have returned to Fujian to participate in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. They said in their speeches that the return of the overseas Chinese has added strength to the socialist construction of the motherland. They expressed their belief that the overseas Chinese will follow Chairman Mao's teachings and turn the overseas Chinese farms into revolutionary schools that are both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military.

Amid prolonged applause, the representative of the returning overseas Chinese, Fang Fujian, took the stage and warmly greeted his fellow countrymen. At the beginning of his speech, he said excitedly: "The greatest love is the love of the Party, and the greatest love is the love of Chairman Mao. Only Chairman Mao understands our sufferings and has saved us from the depths of misery. Long live Chairman Mao forever!"

In his speech filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, Fang Fujian repeatedly expressed: "We will resolutely respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will take Chairman Mao's works as the guiding principle for all our actions, strive to study the 'Three Constantly Read Articles,' transform our worldview, and promote our ideological revolution. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, be both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military, produce well, train well, and turn the overseas Chinese farms into revolutionary schools."

The Red Guards and workers and peasants who participated in the welcome rally presented the overseas Chinese with revolutionary treasures such as the "Three Constantly Read Articles," songbooks of Chairman Mao's quotations, and Chairman Mao's badges. At the end of the rally, the entire audience sang "The Sea Voyage Relies on the Helm."
