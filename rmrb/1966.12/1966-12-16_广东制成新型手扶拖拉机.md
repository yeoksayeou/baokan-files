Workers from the Xinhui County Agricultural Machinery Factory and related units in Guangdong Province have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fostered a spirit of cooperation, broken through foreign constraints, and successfully developed the Work-Farm-10 type walk-behind tractor, which has recently been put into production.

The Work-Farm-10 type walk-behind tractor, compared to current domestic models of the same horsepower, is lighter in weight, consumes less fuel, starts quickly, and is easy to operate. The production of this type of walk-behind tractor also requires less labor hours and steel.

    广东制成新型手扶拖拉机
    广东省新会县农业机械厂等有关单位职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬协作精神，大破洋框框，试制成功工农—10型手扶拖拉机，最近已投入生产。
    工农—10型手扶拖拉机，和目前国内同等马力的手扶拖拉机比较，重量轻，耗油量少，起动快，操作方便，生产这种手扶拖拉机需要的工时和钢材也比较少。
