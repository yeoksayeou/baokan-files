Launch a New High Tide and Strive for Greater Victories

Sri Lankan Friends Believe Red Guards Will Surely Carry the Cultural Revolution Through to the End

NEW DELHI, Dec. 30 (Xinhua) -- A Sri Lankan teacher, Janaki Liyanage, recently spoke to a Xinhua News Agency correspondent in Colombo, enthusiastically praising the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese Red Guards. He said, "Under the guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Red Guards have set an unprecedented, brilliant example—a worthy example to learn from. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and wholeheartedly serve the construction of socialism."

He said, "The Red Guards put politics in command, go among the masses, and blend with the masses, carrying the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end. They will surely achieve even greater victories."

He shouted, "Long live the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat! Long live Chairman Mao!"

On the 21st, the secretary of the Sri Lanka-China Friendship Association delegation, Pereira, spoke to a Xinhua News Agency correspondent about his impressions of his visit to China. He said that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Red Guards are launching a new revolutionary high tide to sweep away the old culture and make culture adapt to the development of politics and the economy. He wished the Chinese Cultural Revolution victory.

Pereira also refuted the slanders and lies spread by imperialism and its running dogs against the Chinese Cultural Revolution.
