Eight thousand Red Guards and revolutionary masses from Shiqi Town, Zhongshan County, held a grand rally and demonstration march today. They strongly condemned the heinous crimes of the Portuguese imperialists in Macau who massacred their fellow countrymen and resolutely supported the courageous struggle of Macau compatriots against oppression.

Red Guards from various schools in Zhongshan County, as well as representatives from the militia, workers, peasants, and residents, all spoke at the rally. They sternly warned the Portuguese authorities that if they did not immediately stop the massacre of Macau compatriots and accept the legitimate demands of the Macau compatriots, all serious consequences would be the full responsibility of the Portuguese authorities.

Representatives from various sectors unanimously pointed out that the powerful seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. Imperialism and reactionaries from various countries are paper tigers. The Portuguese authorities, by opposing our Macau compatriots and the Chinese people, are only lifting a stone to drop it on their own feet and will surely receive the punishment they deserve.

Deputy County Magistrate Deng Yongren and Town Magistrate Lü Sheng of Shiqi Town spoke at the rally, expressing their most resolute support for the just struggle of Macau patriots and pledging to be the strong backing of Macau patriots.

After the rally, the Red Guards and revolutionary masses, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao and plaques with Chairman Mao's quotations, chanted slogans such as "Firmly support the just struggle of Macau compatriots," "Down with American imperialism," and "Strongly protest the fascist bloody atrocities of Portuguese imperialism," and held a magnificent demonstration march.

    中山县石岐镇八千红卫兵和革命群众举行示威游行
    最强烈抗议澳葡当局血腥暴行
    誓作澳门爱国同胞的坚强后盾
    新华社广州九日电　与澳门毗邻的广东省中山县石岐镇的红卫兵和革命群众八千多人，今天举行盛大集会和示威游行，最强烈地声讨澳门葡萄牙帝国主义屠杀澳门同胞的滔天罪行，最坚决地支持澳门同胞反迫害的英勇斗争。
    中山县各校红卫兵以及民兵、工人、农民和街道居民的代表们，纷纷在大会上发表讲话，他们严正地警告澳葡当局，如果不立即停止残杀澳门同胞和接受澳门同胞提出的严正要求，由此引起的一切严重后果要由澳葡当局负完全责任。
    各界代表们一致指出，用毛泽东思想武装起来的强大的中国七亿人民是不好惹的。帝国主义和各国反动派都是纸老虎，澳葡当局同我国澳门同胞和中国人民为敌，只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚，必将受到应得的惩罚。
    中山县副县长邓永年和石岐镇镇长吕胜在声讨会上发表了讲话，对澳门爱国同胞的正义斗争表示最坚决的支持，誓作澳门爱国同胞的后盾。
    会后，广大红卫兵和革命群众抬着毛主席画像和毛主席语录牌，高呼“坚决支持澳门同胞的正义斗争”、“打倒美帝国主义”、“强烈抗议澳葡帝国主义法西斯血腥暴行”等口号，举行了声势浩大的示威游行。
