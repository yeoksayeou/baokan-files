In the 1930s, a group including Zhou Yang and Tian Han, in order to promote the Wang Ming capitulationist line, resorted to various despicable tactics to attack the great cultural warrior Lu Xun, who insisted on Chairman Mao's correct line.

Lu Xun saw through them. In his essay "Reply to Xu Mo Rong and the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front," he wrote with disgust about a visit by Tian Han, Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and Yang Han Sheng: "A car drove up, and four men jumped out... all dressed in Western suits, with a haughty demeanor." Lu Xun rebuked them on the spot, saying they were using the banner of the "Left League" to "use revolution for personal gain" and were "not on the right path."

Tian Han's ugly face was exposed multiple times in Lu Xun's writings. In February 1935, Lu Xun wrote in a letter:

"Since last year, those who call themselves the 'third kind of people' have revealed their true colors, helping their masters to suppress us. However, some of us believe that it is because I attacked them too harshly, forcing them to do so. Last spring, someone wrote an article in the *Dawanbao* saying that my short comments were the consciousness of a comprador. Later, it was known that this article was actually written by a friend. After many people questioned him, he said he had sent a letter to me explaining, but I have not received this letter to this day. In autumn, someone published one of my letters in the *Shehui Yuebao*, and the same magazine also published an article by Yangcunren. Then, a friend using the pseudonym Shao Bo said that I had collaborated with Yangcunren and was a conciliator. When questioned, he said the article was not written by him. But when I publicly questioned him, he had to admit that it was his own work. However, he said: this article was deliberately written to frame me, in order to make me angry and attack Yangcunren. He did not expect that I would turn around and attack him, which was truly beyond his expectations. I never thought of such a tactic. He struck me from behind with a whip, intending for me to get angry and strike someone else with a whip. Now I have seized his whip, and he is 'beyond his expectations.' Since the second half of last year, I have always felt that a few people are siding with the 'third kind of people,' maliciously using me as a toy."

Regarding Tian Han's despicable tactics of stabbing from behind, Lu Xun publicly denounced: "I do not have the power to prevent others from publishing my letters in magazines, and I do not know in advance what other articles are in the same magazine, so I have no intention of expressing conciliation or otherwise to any author in the same magazine; but if someone from the same camp, disguised, stabs me from behind, then my hatred and contempt for him is greater than for an open enemy." Later, Lu Xun wrote in a letter: "The barking of dogs is not to be feared, the most frightening are the 'comrades' who are hypocritical, because they are hard to guard against. For example, the likes of Shao Bo (that is, Tian Han), I still do not understand his intentions. In order to guard the rear, I have to stand sideways, not facing the enemy, and looking forward and backward, it is much more tiring.... Sometimes I am indeed indignant, feeling that I have wasted a lot of energy on serious matters, and the results could be much better."

In another letter, Lu Xun wrote indignantly:

"In the past ten years, I have spent a lot of energy on literary matters, and the result is that I have been injured. Those who are serious and have some credibility are attacked by everyone. Last year, Tian Han wrote an article saying I was a conciliator. I wrote an article questioning him, and he replied that because I had a good reputation, it didn't matter if he said anything. Later, he became like this, and one of our 'comrades' defended him, saying he had a big plan and could not be judged at this time. I truly feel that if one is not clever, it is difficult to survive in China."

Lu Xun's public rebuttal truly stung this group of backstabbers. In the afterword to *Zazao*, Lu Xun wrote: "I heard that at that time, one of our 'comrades' named Shen laughed and said, 'The old man is complaining again!' 'Old' and 'complaining' again, it is indeed very humorous. However, I myself am serious."

In this passage, Lu Xun mentioned the "comrade" who defended Tian Han and the "comrade named Shen," who were precisely Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and others who wore the same pants as Tian Han. In Lu Xun's writings, we can see more clearly who these "revolutionary writers" wearing the cloak of the "Left League" really belong to!

1. The reactionary writer Su Wen and others have always opposed the left-wing literary movement, calling themselves the "third kind of people."
2. That is, the article *On "Flowery Marginalia"* written by Liao Mu Sha under the pseudonym "Lin Mo."
3. A traitor, whom Lu Xun denounced as a "petty peddler in the revolutionary arena."
4. That is, Tian Han. Lu Xun's letter was published as the first article in the magazine, and the last article was by Yangcunren. Tian Han, as if he had caught something, immediately slandered in the *Dawanbao* of the Nationalist Party, accusing Lu Xun of playing the opening drum for Yangcunren's "closing act."
5. In the letter "Reply to the Editor of *Drama* Weekly," Lu Xun had refuted Tian Han's slander.
6. Referring to Tian Han's betrayal and surrender to the enemy after being arrested in Nanjing, Lu Xun had contemptuously denounced Tian Han for acting as a trumpet for the Nationalist Party, "performing his plays in Nanjing!"

    鲁迅怒斥叛徒田汉
    何成
    早在三十年代，周扬、田汉等一伙，为了推行王明投降主义路线，竟对坚持毛主席正确路线的伟大文化战士鲁迅，采取种种卑鄙的手段进行围攻。
    鲁迅是看透了他们的。他在《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》中，曾经憎恶地写到田汉、周扬、夏衍、阳翰笙对他的一次找上门来的挑衅：“驶来了一辆汽车，从中跳出四条汉子”“一律洋服，态度轩昂”，鲁迅当面给以痛斥。说他们打着“左联”的旗号，“借革命以营私”，“不是正路人”。
    田汉的丑恶嘴脸，在鲁迅的笔下曾经多次地给以揭露。一九三五年二月，鲁迅在一封信中说：
      “从去年以来，所谓‘第三种人’①的，竟露出了本相，他们帮着他的主人来压迫我们了。然而我们中的有几个人，却道是因为我攻击他们太厉害了，以至逼得他们如此。去年春天，有人在《大晚报》上作文，说我的短评是买办意识，后来知道这文章其实是朋友做的②。经许多人的质问，他答说已寄信给我解释，但这信我至今没有收到。到秋天，有人把我的一封信，在《社会月报》上发表了，同报上又登有杨村人③的文章，于是又有一个朋友化名绍伯④，说我已与杨村人合作，是调和派。被人诘问，他说这文章不是他做的。但经我公开的诘责时⑤，他只得承认是自己所作。不过他说：这篇文章，是故意冤枉我的，为的是想让我愤怒起来，去攻击杨村人，不料竟回转来攻击他，真出于意料之外云云。这种战法，我真是想不到。他从背后打我一鞭，是要我生气，去打别人一鞭，现在我竟夺住了他的鞭子，他就‘出于意料之外’了。从去年下半年来，我总觉有几个人倒和‘第三种人’一气，恶意的在拿我做玩具。”
    对于田汉的这种背后射暗箭的鄙劣行径，鲁迅又公开怒斥道：“我并无此种权力，可以禁止别人将我的信件在刊物上发表，而且另外还有谁的文章，更无从预先知道，所以对于同一刊物上的任何作者，都没有表示调和与否的意思；但倘有同一营垒中人，化了装从背后给我一刀，则我的对于他的憎恶和鄙视，是在明显的敌人之上的。”后来，鲁迅在通信中说：“叭儿之类是不足惧的，最可怕的确是口是心非的所谓‘战友’，因为防不胜防。例如绍伯（按即田汉）之流，我至今还不明白他是什么意思。为了防后方，我就得横站，不能正对敌人，而且瞻前顾后，格外费力。……我有时确也愤慨，觉得枉费许多气力，用在正经事上，成绩可以好得多。”
    鲁迅在另一封书信中愤慨地写道：
  “近十年来，为文艺的事，实已用去不少精力，而结果是受伤。认真点，略有信用，就大家来打击。去年田汉作文说我是调和派，我作文诘问，他函答道，因为我名誉好，乱说也无害的。后来他变成这样⑥，我们的‘战友’之一却为他辩护道，他有大计划，此刻不能定论。我真觉得不是巧人，在中国是很难存活的。”
    鲁迅对田汉的公开回击，真正刺痛了这一伙背后放暗箭的射手，鲁迅在《且介亭杂文》附记中说：“听说当时我们有一位姓沈的‘战友’看了就呵呵大笑道：‘这老头子又发牢骚了！’‘头子’而‘老’，‘牢骚’而‘又’，恐怕真也滑稽得很。然而我自己，是认真的。”
    鲁迅在这里所提到的为田汉辩护的“‘战友’之一”和
  “姓沈的‘战友’”，正是指同田汉合穿一条裤子的周扬、夏衍等人。在鲁迅的笔下，我们更清楚地看到了这些披着“左联”外衣的“革命作家”，究竟是那一营垒中的人了！
        ①反动文人苏汶等，一贯
    反对左翼文艺运动，自称为
    “第三种人”。
        ②即廖沫沙化名“林默”写的《论“花边文学”》。鲁迅说：“花边文学”“这一个名称，是和我在同一营垒里的青年战友，换掉姓名挂在暗箭上射给我的。”
    ③是一个叛徒，鲁迅斥之为“革命场的一位小贩”。
    ④即田汉。鲁迅的信刊载在刊物的头一篇，末尾是杨村人的。田汉像抓住什么把柄似地便在国民党方面的报纸《大晚报》上，污蔑鲁迅替杨村人的“压轴子”戏“打开场锣鼓”。
    ⑤鲁迅在《答〈戏〉周刊编者信》中，曾经对田汉的污蔑给以回击。
    ⑥指田汉被捕后在南京叛变投敌的事，鲁迅曾经不齿地斥责田汉为国民党充当吹鼓手，“在南京大演其戏”！
