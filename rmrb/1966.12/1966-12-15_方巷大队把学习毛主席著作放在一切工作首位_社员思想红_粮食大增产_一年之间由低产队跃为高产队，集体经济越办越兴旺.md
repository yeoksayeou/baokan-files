Fangxiang Brigade in Jiangsu Province's Yanjiang County, a model unit for studying Chairman Mao's works, has increased the unit yield of its summer crops (wheat, barley, and oats) by 26 percent over last year. The autumn crops have also seen a significant increase in yield, transforming the brigade from a low-yielding unit to a high-yielding one within a year. The state's procurement tasks have been completed ahead of schedule. Both community income and collective accumulation have seen notable increases.

When discussing the experience of this year's grain harvest, the cadres and community members of Fangxiang Brigade said: The hoe needs someone to wield it, but people need their thoughts to be red. Studying Chairman Mao's works must be used to transform one's worldview, continually eliminating capitalist tendencies and establishing socialist ideals, breaking old habits and establishing new ones. Only then will the direction be clear, the path straight, and the resolve firm to walk the socialist road; only then will one farm for the revolution, farm with revolutionary spirit, and make the collective economy thrive.

Over the past year, the Fangxiang Brigade has consistently prioritized the study of Chairman Mao's works in all its activities, whether during the socialist education movement or in subsequent work. They have focused on transforming people's thoughts and promoting ideological revolution. The cadres and community members have undergone profound changes in their worldviews. This change is first evident in everyone's clearer understanding of the direction and firm commitment to the socialist path. The Hongwei Production Team, located in Fangxiang Village, previously faced intense class struggle and conflicts between two paths. Some engaged in petty commerce, others went out to earn money through physical labor, neglecting collective production, resulting in very low grain yields. After reading Chairman Mao's works, especially the passage: "Oppose the capitalist tendency of selfishness and individualism, and advocate the socialist spirit of combining collective and individual interests as the standard for all words and actions..." their eyes were opened, their thoughts changed, and they actively participated in collective labor. This year, the team achieved an unprecedented grain harvest, and collective sideline businesses also developed rapidly.

From last autumn's sowing to this autumn's harvest, the Fangxiang Brigade encountered natural disasters such as rain, drought, and pests. However, people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, most intelligent, and most combat-effective. They fought against the elements in the biting cold of winter and the scorching heat of summer.

Last year, during the critical autumn sowing season, heavy rains made the ground soggy, severely affecting wheat sowing. The Party branch organized cadres and community members to study Chairman Mao's instructions on daring to struggle, daring to win, and self-reliance and hard work. Everyone drew courage and strength from Chairman Mao's works, expressing their determination: "With resolve, unafraid of sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, to strive for victory." Despite the rain, they dug the soil, and as soon as the rain stopped, they hurried to sow the seeds. When oxen couldn't plow the fields, they used manual labor to break the soil and cover the seeds, successfully completing the autumn sowing and winning the first battle for this year's harvest. When the wheat was about to ripen, the entire brigade also eradicated the wheat midge, achieving a bumper wheat harvest.

After overcoming the floods and pestilence, they encountered a severe drought, the likes of which had not been seen in decades. For over a hundred days, there was no significant rainfall. At that time, it was summer, with temperatures reaching 40 degrees Celsius, but the community members were undaunted, taking turns day and night to irrigate the fields. As the drought worsened, some ponds and reservoirs dried up, and water couldn't be drawn to the fields. The community members then carried water from the rivers to the fields. After several dozen days of struggle, the anti-drought efforts were successful.

This year, the Fangxiang Brigade has also made significant progress in scientific farming. They broke old habits and old methods, promoting a series of advanced yield-increasing experiences.

Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the people of Dazhai have overcome severe natural disasters and achieved a grain harvest. Dazhai Brigade's Party branch secretary, Chen Yonggui, said: This year's harvest is the result of the Dazhai people listening to Chairman Mao and promoting production through revolution. The people of Dazhai expressed their determination to select the best grain to support national construction and the world revolution.

    方巷大队把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作首位
    社员思想红  粮食大增产
    一年之间由低产队跃为高产队，集体经济越办越兴旺
    据新华社南京十四日电　学习毛主席著作的先进单位江苏省邗江县方巷公社方巷大队，今年的夏收作物（大麦、小麦、元麦）单位面积产量比去年增加两成六，秋熟作物又获得大幅度的增产，由全公社的低产队一跃为全公社的高产队。国家的征购任务已经超额完成。社员收入和集体积累都有显著增加。
    方巷大队的干部和社员在谈到今年粮食丰收的经验时说：锄头要人拿，人靠思想红。学习毛主席著作要用在改造人的世界观上，不断地灭资兴无，破私立公，破旧立新，才会方向明，道路正，坚决走社会主义道路；才会为革命种田，用革命精神种田，使集体经济越办越兴旺。
    方巷大队近一年多来，不论在社会主义教育运动期间，或是在社会主义教育运动以后的各项工作中，始终把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，狠抓人的思想改造，促进人的思想革命化，干部、社员的世界观发生了深刻的变化。这种变化，首先表现在大家进一步认清了方向，坚定地走社会主义道路。住在方巷小集镇上的红卫生产队，以前阶级斗争和两条道路的斗争非常尖锐，有的当小商贩，有的出外赚脚力钱，不顾集体生产，因而粮食产量很低。大家读了毛主席的书，特别是读了毛主席的这一段话：“反对自私自利的资本主义的自发倾向，提倡以集体利益和个人利益相结合的原则为一切言论行动的标准的社会主义精神，……”眼睛亮了，思想变了，积极参加集体劳动。今年这个队的粮食生产获得空前大丰收，集体副业也有了迅速的发展。
    方巷大队从去年秋种到今年秋收，遇到了雨、旱、虫等自然灾害。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最勇敢、最聪明、最有战斗力。他们在寒风凛冽的严冬和赤日炎炎的盛夏，向天斗、向地斗，斗倒了各种自然灾害。
    去年，正在秋种紧张季节，天雨地烂，严重地影响了种麦。党支部组织干部、群众学习毛主席有关敢于斗争、敢于胜利和自力更生、艰苦奋斗的语录。大家从毛主席著作中得到了勇气和力量，纷纷表示：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”大家冒雨挖墒，雨一停再抓紧时间撒种，牛不能下田破垡，就用人工破垡盖种，胜利地完成了秋播任务，为今年丰收打胜了第一仗。在麦子快要成熟的时候，全大队又扑灭了三麦粘虫，夺取了三麦大丰收。
    战胜了雨涝、虫害，又遇到了几十年来未有的干旱，一百多天没有下过透雨。当时正值夏季，气温高达四十度，但社员们毫不畏惧，日夜轮番车水。随着旱象的发展，有些塘坝水干了，田里车不上水，社员们就把河港里的水挑到田里。经过几十天斗争，抗旱获得了胜利。
    今年，方巷大队在科学种田上也大大前进了一步。他们破旧立新，改变了不少生产上的旧习惯、老办法，推广了一系列的先进增产经验。（附图片）
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的大寨人，战胜了严重的自然灾害，夺得粮食丰收。大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵说：今年的丰收是大寨人听毛主席的话，抓革命促生产的结果。大寨人表示要挑最好的粮食支援国家建设和世界革命。
