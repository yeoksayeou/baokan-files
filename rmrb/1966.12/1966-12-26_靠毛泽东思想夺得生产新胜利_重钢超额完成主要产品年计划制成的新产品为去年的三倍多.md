Revolutionary workers at the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's instructions to seize the revolution and promote production. Relying on Mao Zedong Thought, they have continuously carried out a great revolution in thought to break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness, thus promoting the development of production this year. At present, the company's major products, including steel ingots, steel materials, and refractory materials, have all exceeded the state's annual plan. The quality of various products has generally improved; the number of new products developed is 3.7 times that of last year; production costs have significantly decreased, and labor productivity has increased compared to last year.

In reviewing the great achievements in production this year, the broad masses of workers at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company pointed out: Every victory in production this year is a victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They said: The great Mao Zedong Thought has given us steel workers boundless strength. With this strength, we dare to tread paths that others have not, and we dare to scale heights that others have not reached, achieving new victories in production this year. Revolutionary workers consciously take Zhang Zed and Norman Bethune as examples, striving for complete and thorough service to the people and taking extreme responsibility for their work. They use revolutionary spirit to improve production, pursue excellence, and strive to reach the heights of scientific and technological advancement. Workers' thoughts have changed, and their subjective initiative has been fully unleashed. This year, the small open-hearth steelmaking workshop completed the annual state plan 50 days ahead of schedule, with the quality rate, variety rate, cost, and furnace life of steel all reaching national advanced levels. Workers in the small open-hearth steelmaking workshop said: Relying on Mao Zedong Thought, we have made a great leap forward in one year.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, workers at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have smashed foreign frameworks and walked their own path of industrial development. This year, the state assigned the large open-hearth steelmaking workshop the task of smelting low-alloy steel, which is six to seven times more than last year. Some bourgeois technical "authorities" followed the revisionist "frameworks," calculating and recalculating, and dared not accept this task. Steelworkers armed with Mao Zedong Thought stepped forward and took on the task. They said: Even if the difficulties are as great as the sky, with Mao Zedong Thought, we are not afraid! They broke free from the shackles of bourgeois technical "authorities" and smashed various unreasonable regulations and systems, smelting various types of low-alloy steel according to the state's needs. Since this year, the company has implemented over 12,000 large and small technological innovations, solving a large number of key production problems, and promoting the vigorous development of enterprise production.

    靠毛泽东思想夺得生产新胜利
    重钢超额完成主要产品年计划制成的新产品为去年的三倍多
    据新华社重庆二十四日电　重庆钢铁公司革命职工坚决贯彻执行毛主席、党中央关于抓革命、促生产的指示，靠毛泽东思想，不断进行破私立公的思想大革命，促进了今年生产的发展。目前，全公司的钢锭、钢材、耐火材料等主要产品产量，已经超额完成今年的国家计划；各种产品的质量普遍提高；试制成功的新产品，为去年全年的三点七倍；产品成本显著降低，劳动生产率比去年提高。
    重钢广大职工在回顾今年生产的巨大成绩时指出：今年生产上的每一个胜利，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。他们说：伟大的毛泽东思想，给了我们钢铁工人无穷的力量，凭着这股力量，我们敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰，夺得了今年生产的新胜利。革命职工自觉地以张思德、白求恩为榜样，以“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务和对工作极端负责的精神来要求自己，用革命精神搞好生产，精益求精，努力攀登科学技术高峰。职工思想变了，主观能动性得到了充分的发挥。今年小平炉炼钢车间在设备和原材料条件没有改变的情况下，提前五十天完成了全年国家计划，钢的质量合格率、品种率、成本、炉龄等主要技术经济指标都达到了全国先进水平。小平炉工人们说：靠毛泽东思想，一年大翻身。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，重钢工人遵照毛主席的教导，大破洋框框，走自己工业发展的道路。今年国家交给大平炉炼钢车间的冶炼低合金钢的任务，比去年增加六七倍。一些资产阶级技术“权威”按修正主义的“框框”办事，左算右算，始终不敢接受这个任务。用毛泽东思想武装起来的炼钢工人，挺身而出，把任务承担下来。他们说：即使困难有天大，有了毛泽东思想咱们就不怕！他们破除资产阶级技术“权威”的束缚，破除各种不合理的规程制度，按国家需要炼出了多种低合金钢种。今年以来，全公司一共实现了大小技术革新一万二千多项，解决了大批生产关键问题，推动着企业生产蓬勃发展。
