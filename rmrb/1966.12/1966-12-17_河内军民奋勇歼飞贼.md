The flames of hatred have built an iron wall.
Steely resolve has turned into invincible power.
The military and civilians of Hanoi bravely annihilate the flying bandits.

The battle cry that shakes the mountains and rivers, accompanied by fierce battle gunfire, shook the entire heroic capital. Every street is a fortress of battle, and every person is a brave soldier. ...

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 16th – Our reporter reports: The heroic military and civilians of Hanoi, in the fierce battles to defend the capital on the 13th and 14th, fought fiercely and well. In two days, they shot down twelve American bandit planes, displaying the great heroic spirit of "determined to defeat the American aggressors."

In these two days of intense battle, the American bandits dispatched hundreds of sorties of planes to carry out extremely frenzied bombing of Hanoi. However, the bombs could not intimidate the heroic people. "Defend the capital to the death!" "Firmly carry out Chairman Hu's sacred call to resist America and save the country!" These battle cries that shake the mountains and rivers, accompanied by fierce battle gunfire, shook the entire heroic capital.

Every street is a fortress of battle, and every person is a brave soldier. The heroic military and civilians, with their flames of hatred, built an iron wall that cannot be broken, shattering the boasted "air superiority" of the American bandits.

On one heroic anti-aircraft artillery position, the battle was raging. Young gunner Zhou Chunkuo had his arm injured by shrapnel, and blood stained his sleeves. However, he still insisted on fighting. "Boom!" A bomb exploded near him, injuring his leg again, but he still did not leave his battle post, insisting on fighting to the end! Steely resolve turned into invincible power, and he finally, together with his comrades, shot down the American bandit plane.

On another anti-aircraft artillery position, the platoon leader Phan Van Tri and Nguyen Quoc Trung were both injured, blown over by the bomb blast, and buried in the soil. However, they struggled out from the soil up to their waists and continued to direct the battle, making the entire platoon's cannons roar continuously, closely coordinating with the brother platoons, and shooting down three American bandit planes in one go.

The heroic Vietnamese Air Force also fought well. They took off continuously to intercept enemy planes over two days. They fearlessly and bravely coordinated with ground artillery to attack enemy planes. One air hero, in one day of air combat, blew two American fighter planes to smithereens.

The broad mass of militia and self-defense corps members in Hanoi also displayed fearlessness in the battle. Nguyen Thi Bach, the female militia leader of Phuc Yeu Commune in the southern suburbs of Hanoi, bravely commanded her militia members to shoot at enemy planes with rifles. When a rocket fired by an American air bandit hit near her, injuring her abdomen and back, she insisted on not leaving the front line. After the nurse bandaged her up, she continued to direct the battle.

On various artillery positions in Hanoi, whenever the battle started, batches of militia and self-defense corps members and the masses rushed to support. They carried shells for the troops, wiped the shells, and when needed, they replaced the gunners. Even some white-haired old ladies rushed to the positions, encouraging the soldiers to fight fiercely. Seventy-year-old Chi Grandma saw that the shell casings were piled up high, obstructing the soldiers' battle, so she helped to carry the shell casings. The soldiers advised her to hide, but she refused. She said, "I hate the American bandits to the core! The Vietnamese people will never be slaves and will definitely win victory!"

    仇恨的烈火筑起了铜墙铁壁
    钢铁的意志变成了无敌力量
    河内军民奋勇歼飞贼
    气壮山河的战斗口号，伴随着猛烈的战斗炮火，震撼着整个英雄的首都。每一条街道都是战斗的堡垒，每一个人都是勇敢的战士。……
    新华社河内十六日电　本社记者报道：英雄的河内市军民，在十三日和十四日保卫祖国首都的英勇战斗中，打得狠，打得好，两天击落美国强盗飞机十二架，表现了“决心战胜美国侵略强盗”的大无畏的英雄气概。
    在这两天的激烈战斗中，美国强盗出动了成百架次飞机，对河内市进行了极其疯狂的轰炸。但是，炸弹吓不倒英雄的人民。“誓死保卫首都！”、“坚决实现胡主席的抗美救国神圣号召！”这些气壮山河的战斗口号，伴随着猛烈的战斗炮火，震撼着整个英雄的首都。
    每一条街道都是战斗的堡垒，每一个人都是勇敢的战士。英雄的军民，用他们仇恨的怒火，筑起了打不破的铜墙铁壁，粉碎了美国强盗吹嘘的“空中优势”。
    在一座英雄的高射炮阵地上，战斗正在激烈进行，年轻的炮手周春阔被弹片打伤了手臂，鲜血沾满了他的衣袖。但是他仍然坚持战斗。“轰隆”一声，一颗炸弹在他附近爆炸了，又炸伤了他的腿，而他依然不离开战斗岗位，坚决要求战斗到底！钢铁的意志，变成了无敌的力量，他终于同战友们一起击落了美国强盗飞机。
    在另一座高射炮阵地上，连指挥员范文再和阮国俊都负了伤，被炸弹的气浪冲倒，埋到土里，但是他们从深及半腰的泥土中挣扎出来，继续坚持指挥战斗，使全连的大炮不停地怒吼，密切配合兄弟连队，一举击落美国强盗飞机三架。
    英雄的越南人民空军也打得好。他们在两天中，连续起飞迎击敌机。他们毫不畏惧，勇敢地配合地面炮火进攻敌机。有一位空中英雄在一天的空战中，就把两架美国战斗机打得粉身碎骨。
    河内市广大的民兵自卫队员，在战斗中也同样表现了大无畏的精神。河内市南郊法云乡女民兵队长阮氏碧纯，指挥着她的民兵队员英勇地用步枪射击敌机。当美国空中强盗的一发火箭打到她身旁，使她的腹部和背部受了伤时，她坚持不下火线。当护士给她包扎好以后，她又继续指挥战斗。
    在河内的各个炮兵阵地上，每当战斗开始打响的时候，就有成批的民兵自卫队员和人民群众赶去支援。他们为部队运炮弹，擦炮弹，在需要的时候就代替炮手。甚至有些白发苍苍的老大娘也赶到阵地上，鼓励战士们狠狠地打。七十岁的秩大娘看到炮弹壳堆积很高，妨碍战士们战斗，她就帮助搬运炮弹壳。战士们劝她去隐蔽，被她拒绝了。她说：“我恨透了美国强盗！越南人民决不当奴隶，一定要争取胜利！”
