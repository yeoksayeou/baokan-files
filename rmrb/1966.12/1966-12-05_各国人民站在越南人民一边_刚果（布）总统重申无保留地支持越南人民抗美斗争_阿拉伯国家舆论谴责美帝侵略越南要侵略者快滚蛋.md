People of Various Countries Stand with the Vietnamese People

The President of the Congo (Brazzaville), Massamba-Debat, today reiterated: "The Congolese people unconditionally and unreservedly support the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle for liberation against the aggression of American imperialism."

Massamba-Debat made these remarks at a ceremony where Nguyen De Thang, the new ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, presented his credentials.

Massamba-Debat said, "No matter what means the American imperialists use, no matter how savage the war they wage, even if they bomb Hanoi as they did yesterday, the final victory will belong to the heroic Vietnamese people. The bravery, tenacity, and determination of the Vietnamese people are renowned worldwide."

He pointed out that the Congolese people draw inspiration from the victories achieved by the Vietnamese people.

New Delhi, December 4th: Arab countries' public opinion strongly condemns the U.S. aggression against Vietnam and expresses solidarity with the Vietnamese people's heroic struggle against American imperialism.

Recently, eighteen trade union leaders in Sudan issued a statement in Khartoum stating: "The United States is still waging a dirty, criminal, and inhuman war against the Vietnamese people who are fighting for national freedom and peace." The statement said: "We firmly support the heroic Vietnamese people in defeating the forces of evil and aggression."

Additionally, twenty-six Sudanese citizens issued an appeal condemning the U.S. aggression against Vietnam. The appeal stated: "We must join millions of people around the world in supporting the heroic Vietnamese people and work to stop this barbaric aggression." The appeal demands the withdrawal of U.S. troops and all other puppet forces from South Vietnam.

The Algerian newspaper *Al-Mujahid* criticized the recent "peace plan" proposed by the U.S. representative to the United Nations, Goldberg, at the UN General Assembly, stating that the U.S. is in the position of an aggressor. It said, "The U.S. has invaded someone else's home, committed robbery, and then demanded negotiations, threatening to use force if the demand is not met." The newspaper emphasized: "The aggressor must get out."
