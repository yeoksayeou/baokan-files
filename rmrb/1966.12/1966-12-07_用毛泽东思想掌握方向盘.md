Steering with Mao Zedong Thought

The driver of the motor transport company of a certain unit in the Guangzhou Military Region, Liu Wenqiao, writes:

“When you press down on one side, the other side pops up.”

Safety driving is a big issue in our transport company. In the past, we never managed to solve it properly. Once the wheels started turning, the hearts of us few cadres would hang in mid-air, always fearing an accident. For example, last March, we organized everyone to study the “Three Articles,” but we only touched on some superficial issues and did not touch the soul. Private thoughts were not eliminated, and the idea of serving the people did not take root. Within a week, three accidents occurred. First, a driver did not follow traffic rules and collided with a car parked by the roadside. The company quickly organized driving education. Just as we started focusing on driving, a parking accident occurred. A driver parked the car at a fishery and went to watch the fishing, and a child climbed into the driver's seat and turned on the ignition, damaging the transformer. So, we hurriedly organized parking education. Just as we started focusing on parking, an accident occurred in the parking lot. A squad leader, while delivering a battery, dropped and broke it. How do we solve these problems? We came up with a method of “section-by-section implementation” during driving, which is to introduce the route to be driven every day: how many sharp turns, dangerous bridges, and steep slopes there are, and what situations might arise. We thought that if we could implement the study of Chairman Mao’s works in safety driving, the task would be completed. Unexpectedly, “section-by-section implementation” did not work. On the first day of driving, accident signs started popping up one after another. The more we tried to implement the study of Chairman Mao’s works in safety driving, the more accident signs kept appearing. What should we do? We simply had the cadres take turns to be in charge. However, without the heart, eight cadres were in charge of eight cars, and three cars had accident signs.

In summary, the ideological work of our company in the past was that we did not grasp the root cause, treating the symptoms rather than the root cause, “pressing down on one side, the other side pops up.”

One steering wheel, two worldviews

The constant appearance of accident signs attracted the attention of the company’s party branch. We started by analyzing typical cases to find the problem. Soldier Wu Qichao of the 7th Squad has a relatively weak technical foundation, but he diligently studies Chairman Mao’s works, learns a little and uses a little, and his thoughts on driving for the revolution are very clear. Once he holds the steering wheel, he thinks, “Our responsibility is to be accountable to the people.” Despite his technical shortcomings, he has driven for seven years without an accident. Soldiers say he drives a “political car.” There is a technical “expert” who only thinks about improving his skills to find a good job after demobilization. Once he touches the steering wheel, he thinks about practicing skills, and even if he thinks about safety, it is from the perspective of personal gain and loss. Therefore, accident signs always follow his car. From the comparison of these two people, we drew a conclusion: one steering wheel, two worldviews. One is driving for the revolution, with the people’s lives and property always in mind, fundamentally preventing accidents from happening. The other is driving for personal gain, and no matter how high the skills are, accidents cannot be avoided. We also analyzed other accidents that occurred in the company, and not a single one was not related to personal thoughts. At this time, we realized: the fundamental reason why the company’s safety driving is not implemented is that many comrades have not solved the problem of for whom they are driving. And the root cause is that they have not firmly established the worldview of wholeheartedly serving the Chinese people and the people of the world. “Watering a tree requires watering the roots.” Organizing the company to study and apply Chairman Mao’s works must focus on transforming the worldview.

Therefore, we used the driving rest period to conduct an education campaign on “wholeheartedly serving the people and wholeheartedly driving for the revolution,” and at the same time, launched a big discussion on “for whom are we driving.” Through the discussion, everyone realized: we transport materials for socialist construction and for the elimination of imperialism, adding bricks and tiles. In this way, driving is linked to serving the people, and safety driving is linked to the revolutionary cause. Comrades used Chairman Mao’s teachings on completely and thoroughly serving the people to examine their work, analyze their thoughts, and uproot the roots of individualism. Some comrades said: “In the past, accidents were not caused by low skills, but by low thoughts; always calculating personal gains, accidents would be linked to oneself.” A comrade who used to violate discipline to practice skills said in a sharing session: “In the past, I only thought about practicing skills, often violating discipline. To practice fast driving, every time I drove, I would first pull a large distance, then speed up to catch up with the team, and then stop at a fixed point. To practice slow driving, I ignored the danger and forced the car to move forward by pushing a cow’s tail. In the sharing session, he deeply examined his individualistic thoughts of only focusing on improving skills. He said: “Some comrades’ skills may not be very high, but they have the thought of serving the people, and one skill can be used for three. As for me, I have personal thoughts in my mind, the higher the skills, the more accident signs there are. In the future, I must uproot the ‘I’ and think about serving the people, and use my strength for serving the people, wholeheartedly driving for the revolution.” Many comrades expressed: resolutely smash the “iron rice bowl” of individualism, establish a worldview of wholeheartedly for the revolution and wholeheartedly for the people, and use Mao Zedong Thought to grasp the steering wheel.

This study also had a great impact on the cadres. We realized: in the past, we shouted “safety driving” every day, which seemed to be responsible to the revolution, but there were also personal thoughts. Our starting point for safety was to reduce accidents, reduce criticism, maintain the “four goods,” and report to the superiors, rather than starting from the revolutionary cause, cultivating red successors for the revolution. Everyone expressed their determination to study Chairman Mao’s works well and take the lead in transforming their thoughts.

Starting from every word and deed

After the education on serving the people, the company’s spiritual outlook has changed greatly. Squad Leader Yang Yuqing stood out. Once, we transported a brother unit. Yang Yuqing saw that the new soldiers were not used to long-distance riding, and some were carsick and vomiting, so he thought of them as class brothers from all over the country, heading to the battlefield for a revolutionary goal; how to reduce their fatigue and physical consumption is his greatest responsibility. When they arrived at the rest stop, he invited everyone to get off the car and stretch, and he, despite his fatigue, climbed onto the car to tidy up the backpacks and equipment, so that the soldiers could sit comfortably and reduce fatigue. On rainy days, soldiers with muddy shoes would not only dirty their backpacks but also sit uncomfortably, increasing fatigue. Yang Yuqing brought water to let everyone clean the mud off their shoes. He also used the stopping time to let everyone read Chairman Mao’s quotations, perform quick-talk, and promote Mao Zedong Thought, boosting morale.

There were different opinions about Yang Yuqing’s spirit of wholeheartedly serving the riding unit. Some said: “We are drivers, not service personnel. As long as we drive well and do not have accidents, our mission is accomplished!” This reflected that some comrades were willing to wholeheartedly serve the people with their mouths, but were not prepared to implement it in action. We felt that transforming the worldview must start from every word and deed. Therefore, we further organized everyone to study Chairman Mao’s works and launched an activity to “learn from Yang Yuqing and drive for the revolution as a driver, service personnel, propagandist, and manager.” Everyone read Chairman Mao’s teachings on “selflessly benefiting others,” “extreme enthusiasm,” “extreme responsibility,” and “caring for others more than oneself,” and linked them to their own words and deeds. They realized: the worldview is not abstract, it is reflected in every word and deed. A driver who wholeheartedly serves the people, in addition to safe driving without accidents, should also think of ways to serve the riding unit, promote Mao Zedong Thought, and keep the riding unit’s energy and fighting spirit high. We must use Chairman Mao’s teachings as a standard to require ourselves, start from every word and deed, eliminate the self and promote the public, and repeatedly fight against the “I” to gradually establish a worldview of completely and thoroughly serving the people.

Through education, many comrades could more consciously carry out the struggle to eliminate the self and establish the public. Old soldier Xu Zhongwan, who drove to send art troupe members a year ago, only cared about speeding and did not care about the bumps. Now, he pasted the eight big characters “completely, thoroughly, wholeheartedly” in the driver’s cabin, making himself think of Chairman Mao’s teachings as soon as he touched the steering wheel, driving carefully and considering the class brothers. He compared his two different attitudes and said: “In the past, I only cared about my own convenience and did not care about others’ safety, which was the worldview of bourgeois individualism; now I care about my comrades, which is the worldview of proletarianism. In the future, I will pay attention to cultivating the thought of serving the people.”

In the past, some comrades only cared about driving when transporting materials and did not care about loading and unloading; they only cared about transporting and did not care about loss and damage. Now, everyone treats the transported materials as a struggle between two worldviews. One night, the 4th Squad transported steel bars for a certain construction site. The car had not gone far when the steel bars were dragging on the ground. They had to stop and tie them every few meters. Stopping too many times made some comrades impatient. Squad Leader Yi Shanhui said: “Is it letting the steel bars drag or tying them when they are loose? This is a struggle between two worldviews.” He read to everyone a passage from Chairman Mao about “saving every penny for the war and revolutionary cause.” The soldiers realized: being impatient and not wanting to tie is a lack of high responsibility for the revolutionary cause and a manifestation of non-proletarian worldview. Everyone expressed: “Transporting people is serving people, transporting materials is responsible for materials, and we will not let the state’s property suffer any loss.” They delivered all the steel bars intact to the destination.

As the thought of serving the people improved, everyone raised many things that were considered “small matters” in the past to the height of worldview. In the past, some drivers heard about transporting livestock and were afraid of getting dirty. This time, we accepted the task of transporting horses and pigs, and everyone volunteered. Comrades said: to serve the people, we cannot be afraid of dirt and smell. In the past, when encountering local vehicles, we always rushed to pass first. Now, everyone understands that rushing and yielding reflect two worldviews. One is “I” first, privilege thought; one is others first, yielding in the face of difficulties. In the past, some comrades did not honk when encountering pedestrians in the rain. Now, when driving in the rain and encountering pedestrians, they always honk and slow down from a distance. Everyone said: “Honking or not honking reflects whether you have the people in your heart. The Kuomintang army drives recklessly. We not only ensure the safety of pedestrians but also do not let a drop of mud splash on pedestrians.”

Seeing these changes, we felt the power of Mao Zedong Thought is truly immense. We are determined to take Chairman Mao’s works as the highest directive, through every word and deed, to grasp the transformation of the worldview, and make every soldier truly establish the worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people.

One change, a hundred changes; one connection, a hundred connections

Chairman Mao said: “The transformation of the worldview is a fundamental transformation.” Our company focused on transforming the worldview, not only solving the problem of safety driving, but also relatively solving the “old difficult” problems that have existed in the company’s construction for several years.

One problem is the unity between old and new drivers. Each car is equipped with an old driver and a new driver. Old drivers have the responsibility to help new drivers, and new drivers should humbly learn from old drivers and be good assistants, completing the task together. However, for several years, some old and new drivers often did not get along. We did a lot of work, but the problem was not solved. Aiming at this problem, we held separate meetings for old and new drivers, inspiring everyone to bring their own problems and re-study “In Memory of Norman Bethune,” using Chairman Mao’s teachings to analyze the reasons for the lack of unity between old and new drivers. Chairman Mao said: “We all come from the five lakes and four seas, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together.” “Everything should be based on the interests of the people, not on the interests of individuals or small groups.” Everyone compared with Chairman Mao’s words and had a fierce struggle in their minds. Old drivers examined themselves and said: “In the past, we always thought that new comrades would have many opportunities to drive in the future and should let us practice more. Besides, we are not confident in letting new comrades drive. If an accident happens, the titles of several years of safe driving without accidents, five good soldiers, and technical experts will all be gone. This is all from the ‘I’ character, not from the interests of the people.” New drivers also examined themselves and said: “We also calculated for personal interests, competing to drive more and wanting to master the skills quickly.” The more they talked, the higher their awareness, the more they talked, the broader their minds. Everyone expressed their determination to further uproot the “I” from the worldview, drive for the revolution, and thoroughly solve the unity between old and new drivers. Wang Zhenbo and Su Xiuyi used to break up because they each had their own calculations. Now, they voluntarily requested to form a “red pair” again. They helped and learned from each other, and did well. For personal interests, they broke up; for revolutionary interests, they united. One breakup and one union reflected two worldviews.

The problem of unity between old and new drivers was solved, and we were very happy. We thought: why could the “old difficult” problem that had not been solved for several years be solved this time? Thinking and thinking, we truly understood Chairman Mao’s words: “The transformation of the worldview is a fundamental transformation.” Grasping the transformation of the worldview is grasping the root; grasping the root, other problems will be solved.

Our company has many old soldiers who have served beyond their term. Some comrades were active and eager to improve when they first came to the company; after learning some skills, personal thoughts increased; after serving beyond their term, some wanted to wait for demobilization to drive in big cities; and some were afraid of accidents and risks and did not want to drive anymore. For these problems, education was also conducted many times in the past, but the root cause was not grasped. After the worldview education of serving the people, the problem was basically solved, but not thoroughly. On this basis, we further strengthened the education: we publicized the advanced deeds of old squad leader Mao Xinzheng, who served loyally beyond his term for the revolution, and called on everyone to learn from him. We also guided the old soldiers to calculate their own growth and progress accounts and enemy accounts, making everyone recognize the problem of serving beyond the term from the height of the worldview. Calculating the growth and progress accounts, everyone realized: attributing personal growth and progress to personal struggle and regarding skills as capital for pursuing fame and fortune is the worldview of bourgeois individualism; one should attribute one’s growth and progress to the party’s cultivation and guidance, and contribute one’s learned skills to the revolutionary cause, doing whatever the party asks and for as long as the party asks. This is the worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people. Calculating the enemy accounts, everyone realized: from the worldview of bourgeois individualism, one would forget class struggle, only care about personal comfort, and not care about the fate of the two-thirds of the world’s people who have not been liberated; from the worldview of proletarian revolution, one would take the world revolution as one’s mission and struggle for the liberation of mankind for life. Everyone decided to break with bourgeois individualism and resolve to be successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. When we accepted the urgent transportation task, the old soldiers in the company were all in high spirits. Those who had been approved to visit their families and get married immediately gave up their leave and postponed their wedding. They put revolutionary interests first and voluntarily made personal interests subordinate to revolutionary interests. Now, dozens of old soldiers in our company are all serving loyally, working diligently and taking the lead. They are determined to read Chairman Mao’s books, listen to Chairman Mao’s words, act according to Chairman Mao’s instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

    用毛泽东思想掌握方向盘
    广州部队某部汽车运输连连长　刘文桥
    “按下葫芦浮起瓢”
    安全行车，在我们运输连是一件大事情。过去，我们硬是没有解决好。只要车轮一动，我们几个干部的心就像吊在半空中一样，生怕出事故。比如，去年三月，我们组织大家学习过“老三篇”，但是只抓了一些现象，没有触动灵魂，私心杂念没有破，为人民服务的思想没扎根。不到一周仍出了大小三次事故。先是一个司机不按交通规则行车，碰伤了停在路旁的一台车。连里赶紧抓行车教育。刚抓了行车，停车又出了事故。一个司机把车开到水产场，就跑去看捞鱼，小孩爬进驾驶室，拧开了点火开关，烧坏了变压器。于是，我们又忙着抓停车教育。刚抓了停车，车场里又出了事故。有一个班长送电瓶时，把电瓶摔破了。这些问题怎样解决呢？我们研究出一个在行车中“段段落实”的办法，就是每天把要行驶的路程给大家介绍清楚：有多少急弯、险桥和陡坡，可能出现什么情况，针对这些情况学习毛主席语录。我们心想，如果能把学习毛主席著作落实到安全行车上，任务不就完成了吗？想不到“段段落实”并不灵。出车第一天，事故苗头就一个接一个地冒出来。我们越想把活学活用毛主席著作落实到安全行车上，事故苗头越不断。怎么办呢？我们干脆来一个干部分头把关。但是，把手不把心，八个干部把的八台车，有三台车出了事故苗头。
    总之，我们连队过去的思想工作，就是没有抓住根本，头痛医头、脚痛医脚，“按下葫芦浮起瓢”。
        一个方向盘　两种世界观
    不断出现事故苗头，引起了连队党支部的重视。我们从分析典型入手来找问题。七班战士吴启超，技术基础较差，他能勤勤恳恳地学习毛主席著作，学一点用一点，为革命开车的思想非常明确。一握方向盘，就想着“我们的责任，是向人民负责”。尽管技术差一些，却七年行车无事故。战士们都说他开的是“政治车”。有个技术“尖子”，一心想的是练好技术，复员回去找个好工作。一摸方向盘就想练技术，即使想到安全，也是从个人得失出发。因此，事故苗头总是跟着他的车子跑。从这两个人的对比中，我们得出一个结论：一个方向盘，两种世界观。一个是为革命开车，脑子里时刻装着人民的生命财产，从根本上防止了事故的发生。一个是为个人开车，技术再高也免不了出事故。我们又分析了全连发生的其他事故，没有一件不是和私心杂念相联系的。这时，我们才认识到：连队安全行车不落实的根本原因，就是很多同志为谁开车的问题没有解决。而它的根子，就是没有牢固地树立全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务的世界观。“浇树要浇根”。组织连队活学活用毛主席著作，必须狠抓世界观的改造。
    于是，我们利用行车休整阶段，进行了一次“全心全意为人民服务，一心一意为革命开车”的教育，同时展开了“为谁开车”的大讨论。通过讨论，大家认识到：我们运输物资，都是为社会主义建设、为消灭帝国主义增砖添瓦。这样，就把开车和为人民服务联系在一起，把安全行车和革命事业联系在一起。同志们用毛主席关于完全、彻底为人民服务的教导，检查了工作，分析了思想，挖出了个人主义的根子。有的同志说：“过去出事故，不是技术低，而是思想低；心里老打个人主义小算盘，事故就和自己结了缘。”有个同志过去为了练技术，经常违犯纪律。他为了练习开快车，每次出车，总是先拉大距离，然后超速赶队，再来个“定点停车”。为了练习开慢车，他竟不顾危险，硬是用汽车顶着一头牛的尾巴前进。在讲用会上，他深刻地检查了自己只顾练好技术的个人主义思想。他说：“有的同志技术虽不很高，但是有为人民服务的思想，一分技术发挥了三分作用。而我呢，满脑子私心杂念，技术越高，事故苗头就越多。今后一定要挖掉‘我’字，心往为人民服务上想，劲往为人民服务上使，全心全意为革命开车。”许多同志纷纷表示：坚决砸碎个人主义的“铁饭碗”，树立一心为革命，一心为人民的世界观，用毛泽东思想掌握方向盘。
    这次学习，对干部的教育也很大。我们认识到：过去天天喊“安全行车”，表面看来是对革命负责，其实也有私心杂念。我们抓安全的出发点，是为了少出事故，少挨批评，保住“四好”，好向上级交账，而不是从革命事业出发，为革命培养红色接班人。大家都表示，决心学好毛主席著作，带头改造思想。
        从一言一行入手
    经过为人民服务的教育，连队的精神面貌有了很大的变化。六班长杨余庆表现得更突出。有一次，我们载运兄弟部队。杨余庆看到新战士不习惯长途乘车，有的晕车呕吐，就想到他们都是来自五湖四海的阶级兄弟，为了一个革命目标而奔赴战斗岗位；如何减少他们的疲劳和体力消耗，是自己的最大责任。到了休息地点，他招呼大家下车活动活动，自己不顾劳累，爬上车去，把背包和器材整理一遍，让战士们坐得平稳松快，减轻疲劳。下雨天，战士们带着满鞋底的泥巴上车，不仅会弄脏背包，而且坐着也不敢伸腿，会增加疲劳。杨余庆就提了水来，让大家洗净鞋底上的泥巴。他还抓紧停车时间，让大家读毛主席语录，说快板，宣传毛泽东思想，鼓舞情绪。
    对杨余庆这种全心全意为乘车部队服务的精神，也有不同的看法。有的说：“我们是驾驶员，又不是服务员，开好车，不出事故，就完成任务啦！”这反映了有些同志口头上愿意全心全意为人民服务，但是并不准备落实到行动上。我们觉得，改造世界观还必须从抓一言一行入手。于是，我们进一步组织大家学习了毛主席著作，开展一个“学习杨余庆，为革命开车当四员（驾驶员、服务员、宣传员、保管员）”的活动。大家读了毛主席关于“毫不利己专门利人”，“极端的热忱”，“极端的负责任”，“关心他人比关心自己为重”等教导，联系自己的一言一行，认识到：世界观并不是抽象的，它表现在一言一行之中。一个全心全意为人民服务的驾驶员，除了安全行车不出事故外，还要想方设法为乘车部队服务，宣传毛泽东思想，使乘车部队保持充沛的精力和旺盛的斗志。我们每个同志，只有以毛主席的教导为标准来要求自己，从一言一行入手，灭资兴无，反复同“我”字作斗争，才能逐步树立起完全彻底为人民服务的世界观。
    通过教育，许多同志能比较自觉地展开破私立公的斗争。老战士许忠万，一年以前出车送文工团员的时候，只顾飞车赶路，不管车子颠簸。现在，他把
  “完全、彻底、全心全意”八个大字贴在驾驶室里，使自己一摸方向盘，就想到毛主席的教导，开起车来处处替阶级兄弟着想，把车开得平平稳稳。他对比自己前后两种不同态度时说：“以前，我是只顾自己方便，不管别人安危，这是资产阶级个人主义世界观；现在处处为同志们着想，这是无产阶级世界观。今后，我要处处注意培养为人民服务的思想。”
    过去有些同志在运输物资时，只管开车，不管装卸；只管运送，不管丢失和损坏。现在，大家把如何对待运载的物资，当作两种世界观的斗争。有一个夜晚，四班为某工地运送钢筋，车子没走多远，钢筋就在地上拖着跑，他们走一段就要停下来绑一次。停多了，有的同志就不耐烦了。班长易善雷说：“是让钢筋拖着走，还是松了就绑？这就是两种世界观的斗争。”他给大家念了毛主席讲的“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业”的一段话。战士们认识到：怕麻烦不愿绑，就是缺乏对革命事业高度负责的精神，就是非无产阶级世界观的表现。大家一致表示：“拉人为人服务，拉物对物负责，决不让国家财产受到一丝一毫的损失。”他们把全部钢筋完好无损地送到了目的地。
    随着为人民服务思想的提高，大家把许多过去认为的“小事”，提高到世界观的高度来认识。过去有些司机听说拉牲畜就怕脏。这次我们接受了运马运猪的任务，大家抢着拉。同志们说：要为人民服务，就不能怕脏怕臭。过去与地方车辆会车时，总是先抢先过。现在，大家懂得了一抢一让反映了两种世界观。一个是“我”字第一，特权思想；一个是他人第一，遇事谦让。过去，有些同志雨天行车遇到行人不按喇叭。现在雨天行车，遇到行人，总是远远地按喇叭放慢车速。大家说：“按不按喇叭，这反映你心目中有没有人民。国民党军队开起车来横冲直撞。我们不但要保证行人的生命安全，就连一滴泥水也不能溅到行人身上。”
    看到这些转变，我们感到毛泽东思想的威力真是无比强大。我们决心以毛主席著作为最高指示，通过一言一行，狠抓世界观的改造，使每个战士真正树立起全心全意为人民服务的世界观。
        一变百变　一通百通
    毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。我们连狠抓了世界观的改造，不仅解决了安全行车问题，几年来连队建设中存在的“老大难”问题，也得到了较好的解决。
    一个问题是新老司机的团结问题。每台车都配有一个老司机，一个新司机。老司机有帮带新司机的责任，新司机要虚心向老司机学习，当好助手，共同完成任务。可是，几年来，有些新老司机之间常常闹不团结。我们作了不少工作，问题还是没有解决。针对这个问题，我们分别召开了新老司机座谈会，启发大家带着自己的问题，重新学习《为人民服务》，自觉地运用毛主席的教导，分析新老司机不团结的原因。毛主席
  说：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目
  标，走到一起来了。”“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。大家对照毛主席的话，展开了激烈的思想斗争。老司机检查自己说：“我们过去总认为新同志今后开车的机会很多，应该让我们多练一练。再说让新同志开车也不放心，万一出个事故，几年的安全行车无事故、五好战士、技术能手的称号，都飞了。这全是从‘我’字出发，不是从人民的利益
  出发。”新司机也检查自己说：“我们也是为个人利益打算，争着多开车，想快点掌握技术。”大家越谈觉悟越高，越谈心胸越开阔。一致表示，要进一步从世界观上挖掉“我”字，为革命开车，彻底搞好新老司机的团结。王振波和苏秀喜过去因为各打各的小算盘，拆了对子。现在，他们主动要求再结成“一对红”。他们互相帮助，互相学习，干得很好。为个人打算而散，为革命利益而合，一散一合，反映了两种世界观。
    新老司机团结的问题解决了，我们高兴极了。我们想：为什么几年没解决的“老大难”问题，这次能解决得了呢？想来想去，我们真正理解了毛主席的这句话：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。抓了世界观的转变，就抓住了根本；抓住了根本，其它问题就迎刃而解了。
    我们连超期服役的老战士很多。有些同志刚来连队时，积极肯干，上进心强；学到一些技术后，私心杂念有所增长；超期服役以后，有的人就想等复员到大城市开汽车；还有的怕出事故担风险，不想再开车了。对于这些问题，平时也进行了不少教育，但总没抓到根子上。经过为人民服务的世界观教育，基本上解决了，但是还不彻底。在这个基础上，我们又进一步加强教育：宣传了超期服役老班长毛新政忠心耿耿为革命安心服役的先进事迹，号召大家向他学习。又引导老战士算了自己成长进步账和敌情账，使大家从世界观的高度来认识超期服役的问题。算了自己成长的进步账，大家认识到：把个人的成长进步看成是个人奋斗的结果，把技术看作是追求名利的资本，这是资产阶级个人主义世界观；应该把自己的成长进步归功于党的培养和教导，把自己学到的技术贡献给革命事业，党叫干啥就干啥，叫干多久就干多久，这才是全心全意为人民服务的世界观。算了敌情账，大家认识到：从资产阶级个人主义的世界观出发，就会忘记阶级斗争，只顾个人安逸，不管世界上三分之二没有解放的人民的死活；从无产阶级革命世界观出发，就会以世界革命为己任，为人类彻底解放而奋斗终身。大家决心和资产阶级个人主义决裂，立志做无产阶级革命事业接班人。当我们接受紧急运输任务的时候，连里的老战士个个情绪高昂。已经批准探家、结婚的，立即放弃休假，推迟婚期。他们以革命利益为重，自觉地做到个人利益服从革命利益。现在，我们连几十名老战士个个安心服役，工作勤勤恳恳、处处带头。他们立志读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
