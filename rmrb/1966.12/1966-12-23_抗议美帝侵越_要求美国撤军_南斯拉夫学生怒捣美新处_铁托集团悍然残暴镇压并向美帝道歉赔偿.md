	Protest Against U.S. Aggression in Vietnam; Demand U.S. Troops Withdraw
	Yugoslav Students Rage Against U.S. Information Agency
	Tito Clique Brutally Suppresses and Apologizes to U.S. Imperialism

	BEIJING, Dec. 21 (Xinhua) -- BELGRADE -- A report from Belgrade says that on December 20, more than 15,000 students and faculty from high schools and universities in Zagreb, along with local residents, held a rally and demonstration to support the Vietnamese people's just struggle and to protest against U.S. aggression in Vietnam. The rally was brutally suppressed by the Tito clique, which serves as a lackey of U.S. imperialism.

	According to reports, 15,000 students and faculty from high schools and universities in Zagreb, including Asian, African, and Latin American students studying in Yugoslavia, held a mass rally and demonstration on December 20 to protest against U.S. aggression in Vietnam. After the rally, they marched to the U.S. Consulate. Along the way, thousands of Zagreb residents joined the demonstrators. The demonstrators shouted slogans demanding that the U.S. stop its aggression against Vietnam and that the U.S. imperialists get out of Yugoslavia. They also decided to deliver a letter of protest to the U.S. Consulate, demanding that the U.S. unconditionally withdraw its troops from South Vietnam.

	The Tito clique, which has always served U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam, was extremely frightened by the demonstrators' anti-U.S. actions. They mobilized a large number of armed police to set up three lines of defense around the U.S. Consulate and brutally suppressed the demonstrators. According to reports, mounted police used tear gas, water cannons, and batons against the angry demonstrators who attacked the U.S. Consulate. They forcibly seized the demonstrators' anti-U.S. aggression signs and prohibited them from burning paper effigies of Johnson.

	Despite the police's obstruction and beatings, the demonstrators threw a large number of fruits, eggs, wood blocks, and stones at the doors and windows of the U.S. Consulate and eventually broke into the building. According to reports, during the demonstrators' more than two-hour attack, "the 16 large display cases and reading rooms of the U.S. Information Agency were smashed to pieces. Most of the glass windows on the second and third floors of the consulate were also smashed by stones."

	According to Yugoslav newspapers, during the struggle between the demonstrators and the police, "several people were injured, and several were arrested."

	The Tito clique, fearing that the people's anti-U.S. actions would anger their master, had their foreign minister, Nikic, meet with the U.S. ambassador the next day. They kowtowed and apologized, desperately trying to show that the Yugoslav authorities had done their best to protect the U.S. Consulate and agreed to compensate for the damages.

    抗议美帝侵越　要求美国撤军
    南斯拉夫学生怒捣美新处
    铁托集团悍然残暴镇压并向美帝道歉赔偿
    新华社二十一日讯贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫萨格勒布市大中学校师生和市民为声援越南人民的正义斗争和反对美国对越南的侵略，二十日举行示威游行，遭到美帝的走狗铁托集团的残暴镇压。
    据报道，萨格勒布市一万五千名大中学校师生，其中包括亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲在南斯拉夫学习的留学生，二十日举行群众集会和示威，抗议美国侵略越南。集会结束后，他们走上街头，直奔美国领事馆。一路上，几千名萨格勒布市民参加了示威者的行列。示威者高呼口号，要求美国停止对越南的侵略战争，并要求美国佬滚出南斯拉夫。他们还决定向美国领事馆递交一封抗议信，要求美国无条件地从南越撤退侵略军。
    一贯为美帝国主义侵越战争效劳的铁托集团，对示威者的反美行动十分恐慌，出动大批武装警察，在美国领事馆周围布置了三道封锁线，并对示威者进行残暴的镇压。据报道，骑警使用催泪弹、水龙和警棍对付愤怒袭击美国领事馆的示威者，强行夺走了他们手中抗议美国侵略越南的标语牌，并禁止他们焚烧用纸做的模拟约翰逊的人像。
    示威者不顾骑警的阻拦和殴打，朝着美国领事馆的门窗投掷了大批水果、鸡蛋、木块和石头，并最后闯进了美国领事馆。据报道，在示威者两个多小时的袭击中，“美新处的十六个大展览橱窗和阅览室被砸得粉碎。领事馆二楼和三楼的办公室的大部分玻璃窗也全被石头砸破”。
    据南斯拉夫报纸透露，在示威者同警察进行的搏斗中，“有几个人受伤，几个人被捕”。
    铁托集团唯恐群众的反美行动触怒它的主子，次日它的外长尼凯集奇在接见美国大使时，卑躬屈膝地向他道歉赔礼，竭力表白南斯拉夫当局已尽力保护了美国领事馆，并一口答应给予赔偿。
