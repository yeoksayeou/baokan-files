This is another great victory for the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and Chairman Mao's brilliant ideology. China's historic victories at home and abroad are a heavy and decisive blow to U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and a great encouragement, impetus, and support for the anti-imperialist, anti-colonial struggles of all progressive humanity.

	BEIJING, Dec. 30 (Xinhua) — Chairman Mao has received a telegram from Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, warmly congratulating China on its latest successful nuclear explosion. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	To Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

	I, on behalf of the Albanian people and the Party of Labour of Albania, extend our warmest fraternal greetings and respect to you and, through you, to the People's Liberation Army, the scientific workers, the engineers, the technicians, and all the fraternal Chinese people, for the successful nuclear explosion conducted on December 28, 1966. This brilliant achievement has raised Chinese socialist science and technology to a new, higher level. It is another great victory for the genius Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and your brilliant ideology.

	The achievements continuously made by the 700 million Chinese people in nuclear tests, as well as the historic victories at home and abroad, are a heavy and decisive blow to the aggressive plans and evil conspiracies of the U.S. imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists. The U.S. imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists attempt to monopolize nuclear weapons and dominate the world, forcing the peoples of various countries who are bravely fighting for national and social liberation to submit. All progressive humanity rejoices in the great People's Republic of China's new brilliant victory, extends heartfelt congratulations, and regards it as encouragement, impetus, and support for their common struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and their running dogs.

	The Albanian people regard this great victory of the fraternal Chinese people as their own victory, feeling heartfelt joy and inspiration. The Albanian people congratulate their comrades-in-arms, the great Chinese people, on new, greater achievements and victories in socialist construction, the continuous strengthening of national defense, the enhancement of the honor of their great motherland, and the cause of benefiting the peoples of the world.

	Enver Hoxha
