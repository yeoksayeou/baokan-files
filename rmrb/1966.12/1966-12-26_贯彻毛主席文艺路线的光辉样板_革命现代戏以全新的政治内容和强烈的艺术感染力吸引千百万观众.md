Revolutionary modern plays, with their entirely new political content and powerful artistic appeal, have attracted millions of viewers.

This is a great achievement in the unyielding struggle led by Comrade Jiang Qing and revolutionary literary and art workers against the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers highly praise our country's great achievements in the literary revolution and warmly celebrate the great victory of Chairman Mao's literary line.

On December 25, Xinhua News Agency reported: Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, due to the unyielding struggle led by Comrade Jiang Qing and revolutionary literary and art workers against the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line, our country's literary revolution has achieved epoch-making progress in the reform of Peking opera, ballet, and symphonic music, producing a batch of brilliant revolutionary art models. These model works, born in the midst of intense class struggle, with their entirely new political content and powerful artistic appeal, have unprecedentedly attracted the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and have been warmly welcomed and highly praised by them.

In recent years, revolutionary modern model works such as the Peking operas "The Red Lantern," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "The Harbor," and "The Battle of the White Tiger Regiment," the ballets "The Red Detachment of Women" and "The White-Haired Girl," and the symphonic music "The Red Lantern" have been performed in many cities and rural areas across the country, causing a great sensation and creating an unprecedented scene of people flocking to see revolutionary modern plays everywhere. Many viewers excitedly said that the birth of these model works is a great achievement in the history of Chinese and world literature, a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a great victory of Chairman Mao's literary line. We must resolutely defend the brilliant achievements of the literary revolution. We must shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: "Long live proletarian revolutionary modern plays!"

Many workers, soldiers, and Red Guards in the capital, in thousands of letters to the troupes, quoted a passage from Chairman Mao's letter to the Yan'an Drama Troupe after watching "Forced into Rebellion" in 1944: "History is created by the people, but on the old stage (and in all literature and art that are divorced from the people) the people are reduced to dregs, while the stage is dominated by gentlemen, ladies, young masters, and young ladies. This inversion of history is now being inverted again by you, restoring history to its true face. From now on, old dramas have a new look, which is worth celebrating." They used this to explain that the reforms of Peking opera, ballet, and symphonic music in recent years are very good and need to continue!

They said, "The Red Lantern," "The Red Lantern," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and "The Red Detachment of Women," "The White-Haired Girl," and other plays are good because they have inverted the inverted history again, truly making workers, peasants, and soldiers the masters of the artistic stage, allowing workers, peasants, and soldiers to hold their heads high on the stage. These works successfully created images of proletarian revolutionary heroes, turning the artistic stage into a vivid red classroom for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, making them feel particularly excited and familiar. An old worker from Henan Province wrote to the newspaper, saying, "We workers love to watch revolutionary modern plays. This is because the emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties on the Peking opera stage have been driven away; heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers have occupied this territory. The heroic figures in these plays seem to have been seen somewhere, looking so familiar and so close. The performance of these plays has boosted the morale of the working class and crushed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie.

Two loaders at Beijing Railway Station said after watching the revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Harbor," "We loaders, who were once called 'stinking feet' and 'stinking laborers' in the old society, can now step onto the artistic stage, and we are truly happy! When we heard the loader squad leader Gao Zhiyang sing about the bitter life of loaders in the old society, 'stained with blood and tears, covered with wounds,' we thought of our past. We must forever remember the deep hatred of the old society and never let the history of the old society repeat itself." Some workers in Beijing, when talking about the achievements of ballet reform, said, "Workers, peasants, and soldiers becoming the masters of the ballet artistic stage is something that has never happened in the world. We watched the ballets 'The Red Detachment of Women' and 'The White-Haired Girl' and felt very close to them, receiving great education from them. We workers have today because of the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao not only made us stand up in politics and economics but now also made us stand up in culture and art. We will forever shout: Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times long live!"

Many workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards enthusiastically recounted how they received vivid class education and had their revolutionary will inspired by watching revolutionary artistic model works. Many of them, after watching the revolutionary modern Peking operas "The Red Lantern" and "The Red Lantern," immediately wrote down their resolutions in the comment book: We must learn from the heroic figures in the plays, take up the torch of revolution, and carry the proletarian revolution to the end! Many Red Guards excitedly said, "After watching 'The Red Lantern,' we must take up the red lantern of Mao Zedong Thought, pass it on, and let the light of this lantern redden all of China and the world!" A soldier from a certain air force unit said, "The heroic image of Yang Zirong in 'Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy' is the embodiment of countless heroes of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. It tells us that the people's army wins battles relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought."

An old worker from Shanghai Textile Mill No. 7 said after watching the ballet "The White-Haired Girl," "Xi'er's suffering is the suffering of all laboring people in the old society and is also the suffering of all people oppressed and exploited by imperialism in the world today. Watching 'The White-Haired Girl' broadened our horizons. We not only want to do well in China's revolution but also want to help all oppressed people in the world make revolution, overthrow imperialism and reactionaries, and eliminate all systems of exploitation!" A female commune member from the suburbs of Hangzhou City said, "After watching the ballet 'The Red Detachment of Women,' I thought of China's Nan Batie, who has been overthrown, but there are still many Nan Batie in the world, and there are still countless Wu Qinghua suffering. We must follow Chairman Mao closely, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry out thorough revolution, and support the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed people in the world to create a bright red new world!"

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary people, while celebrating the great victory of our country's literary revolution, said that the appearance of this batch of revolutionary artistic model works, shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, is like a series of heavy artillery shells, a fierce bombardment against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road in the former Beijing Municipal Committee, the former Propaganda Department, and the former Ministry of Culture, and the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line they represent. Recently, revolutionary masses in the capital held a meeting after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Conference in the literary and art circles, angrily exposing the heinous crimes of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, the former Propaganda Department, and the former Ministry of Culture, who had long colluded with each other, fiercely resisted Chairman Mao's literary line, and sabotaged the literary revolution. They pointed out that these counter-revolutionary revisionists extremely hated the revolutionary reforms of Peking opera, ballet, and symphonic music directly led by Comrade Jiang Qing, using every means to obstruct and sabotage, attempting to let emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, dead people, and foreigners continue to dominate our artistic stage, using the poison of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism to corrupt the revolutionary will of the masses. They hated our workers and peasants standing up politically and would not let us stand up culturally. In a word, they attempted to use literature and art as a tool to attack proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism. This is something we revolutionary people cannot tolerate! It is time for us to thoroughly settle the accounts of these ghosts and snakes and thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line.

Two model workers from Shanghai wrote in a letter to the troupe after watching the Peking opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "Your play is great, and we workers welcome it with applause. We know that this play was born in the struggle against the class enemy. It once again proves that Chairman Mao's teaching is an unshakable truth: 'Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress. Their struggle is a life-and-death struggle.' Many workers, peasants, and soldiers also said, "Without overthrowing the old things, new culture and new art cannot be established. Without struggle, there can be no revolutionary modern plays! We will resolutely carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with revolutionary literary and art workers, and under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, create the most brilliant and splendid new literature and art in human history.

    贯彻毛主席文艺路线的光辉样板
    革命现代戏以全新的政治内容和强烈的艺术感染力吸引千百万观众
    这是江青同志和革命文艺工作者高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同反革命修正主义文艺路线进行不屈不挠斗争所取得的划时代成就。广大工农兵和革命群众高度赞扬我国文艺革命的伟大创举，热烈欢呼毛主席文艺路线的伟大胜利。
    新华社二十五日讯　在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，由于江青同志和革命文艺工作者同反革命修正主义文艺路线进行不屈不挠的斗争，我国文艺革命在京剧改革、芭蕾舞剧改革、交响音乐改革等方面取得了划时代的成就，出现了一批光辉灿烂的革命艺术样板。这批诞生在严重的阶级斗争中的样板作品，以全新的政治内容和强烈的艺术感染力量，空前地吸引了广大工农兵和革命群众，受到了他们最热烈的欢迎和高度的赞扬。
    近几年来，京剧《沙家浜》、《红灯记》、《智取威虎山》、《海港》、《奇袭白虎团》，芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》，交响音乐《沙家浜》等革命现代样板作品在全国许多城市和农村公演，引起了极大的轰动，到处出现了满城争看革命现代戏的空前盛况。很多观众无比兴奋地说，这批样板作品的诞生，是中国和世界文艺史上的伟大创举，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是毛主席文艺路线的伟大胜利。我们要坚决捍卫文艺革命的辉煌战果，我们要千遍万遍地高呼：“无产阶级革命现代戏万岁！”
    首都许多工人、解放军战士和红卫兵小将们，在写给剧团的上千封信中，引用了毛主席在一九四四年看了《逼上梁山》以后写给延安平剧院的信中的一段话：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台，这种历史的颠倒，现在由你们再颠倒过来，恢复了历史的面目，从此旧剧开了新生面，所以值得庆贺。”用来说明几年来进行的京剧、芭蕾舞剧和交响音乐的革命改革好得很，还需要继续改下去！
    他们说，《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《智取威虎山》以及《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》等等，这些戏之所以好，就是由于它们把被颠倒了的历史又颠倒过来，真正让工农兵成为艺术舞台的主人，让工农兵在舞台上扬眉吐气。这些作品成功地塑造了无产阶级革命英雄形象，把艺术舞台变成宣传毛泽东思想的生动的红色大课堂，使他们看了感到特别兴奋，特别亲切。河南省的一位老工人在写给报社的信中说，我们工人最爱看革命现代戏。这是因为京剧舞台上的帝王将相、才子佳人被赶走了；工农兵英雄人物占领了这块阵地。这些戏里的英雄人物，我们都好像在哪里见过，看来是那样亲切，那样熟悉。这些戏的演出，长了我们工人阶级的志气，灭了资产阶级的威风。
    北京火车站的两位装卸工人看了革命现代京剧《海港》以后说，我们这些在旧社会被人叫做“臭脚行”、“臭苦力”的装卸工人，现在也能登上艺术舞台，心里真是高兴！当我们听到戏中装卸组长高志扬唱到装卸工人在旧社会“斑斑血泪，累累创伤”的苦难生活时，我们就想到了自己的过去。我们要把旧社会的深仇大恨永记心头，绝不能让旧社会的历史重演。北京有些工人在谈到芭蕾舞剧的改革成就时说，工农兵成为芭蕾艺术舞台的主人，这是世界上从没有过的事。我们看了芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》，感到很亲切，从中受到了很大教育。我们工人能够有今天，都因为有了我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导。毛主席不仅使我们在政治上、经济上翻了身，现在又让我们在文化艺术上翻了身，我们要永远高呼：毛主席万岁，万万岁！
    许多工人、农民、解放军战士和红卫兵还热情地叙述了他们从观看革命的艺术样板作品中，受到生动的阶级教育，革命意志得到鼓舞。他们之中的许多人看了革命现代京剧《沙家浜》和《红灯记》以后，立即在留言簿上写下自己的决心：我们一定向戏中的英雄人物学习，接过革命的火炬，把无产阶级革命进行到底！许多红卫兵小将激动地说，看了《红灯记》，我们一定要把毛泽东思想的红灯接过来，传下去，让这盏灯的光芒，照红全中国，照红全世界！解放军空军某部战士说，《智取威虎山》中杨子荣的英雄形象，是中国人民解放军千千万万个英雄的化身。它告诉我们，人民的军队打胜仗，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    上海市国棉七厂一位老工人看了芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》以后说，喜儿的苦难是旧社会所有劳动人民的苦难，也是现在世界上一切受帝国主义压迫和剥削的人民的苦难。看了《白毛女》使我们眼光更远了。我们不仅要搞好中国的革命，还要帮助世界上一切被压迫人民闹革命，打倒帝国主义和反动派，铲除一切剥削制度！杭州市郊区的一位女社员说，看了芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，使我想到中国的南霸天虽然被打倒了，但是世界上还有许多个南霸天没有打倒，还有千千万万个吴清华在受苦受难。我们一定要紧跟毛主席，活学活用毛主席著作，彻底闹革命，支持世界上一切被压迫人民的革命斗争，创造出一个红彤彤的新世界来！
    广大工农兵和革命群众在欢呼我国文艺革命取得的伟大胜利时说，这批闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的革命艺术样板作品的出现，像一发发重磅炮弹一样，是对旧北京市委、旧中宣部和旧文化部一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和他们所代表的反革命修正主义文艺路线的猛烈轰击。首都革命群众最近在文艺界无产阶级文化大革命大会之后举行的一次集会上，愤怒地控诉了旧北京市委、旧中宣部、旧文化部长期以来互相勾结，竭力抗拒毛主席文艺路线，破坏文艺革命的滔天罪行。他们指出，这些反革命修正主义分子，极端仇视江青同志直接指导的京剧、芭蕾舞剧和交响音乐的革命改革，千方百计地进行阻挠和破坏，企图让帝王将相、才子佳人、死人洋人继续统治我们的艺术舞台，用封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的毒素，腐蚀人民大众的革命意志。他们仇视我们工农在政治上抬头，也不让我们工农在文化上抬头。一句话，他们企图把文艺作为进攻无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的工具。这是我们革命人民绝不能容忍的！现在是我们彻底清算这些牛鬼蛇神的罪行、彻底摧毁反革命修正主义文艺路线的时候了。
    上海市两位五好工人看了京剧《智取威虎山》以后，在给剧团的一封信中说，你们这出戏，就是好，我们工人拍手欢迎。我们知道，这出戏是在同阶级敌人进行针锋相对的斗争中产生的。它又一次证明了毛主席这样一段教导是颠扑不破的真理：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行，它们之间的斗争是生死斗争。”许多工农兵观众还说，不把旧东西打倒，什么新文化、新艺术都是建立不起来的。没有斗争，就没有革命现代戏！我们坚决和革命的文艺工作者一道，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，创造出人类历史上最光辉灿烂的新文艺。
