Thousands of students at the University of California staged demonstrations and boycotted classes for two consecutive days, angrily protesting against the Johnson government's deception of young students to serve as cannon fodder in the Vietnam War.

The students' protests and demonstrations were triggered by the military's establishment of a recruitment station in the student union building on November 30. At that time, hundreds of students rushed into the building, shouting slogans against the Vietnam War and holding a "sit-in" protest until evening. The school authorities called in a large number of police, attempting to use force to drive the protesting students out of the building. The police charged into the crowd, wielding batons and brutally beating the unarmed protesting students, which met with their courageous resistance. At this point, a large number of students rushed to the scene to join the fight, increasing the number of protesters to nearly 2,000, making the situation more intense. They fought with the police inside and outside the building and shouted slogans against the Vietnam War.

On the second day, the number of protesting students increased to 6,000. They held a protest rally in the rain and unanimously passed a resolution to launch a boycott of classes. They firmly opposed the military's recruitment activities on campus.

    据新华社二日讯　旧金山消息：美国加利福尼亚大学数千名学生接连两天举行示威和罢课，愤怒抗议约翰逊政府诱骗青年学生充当侵越战争炮灰。
    学生们的抗议示威是由于十一月三十日军方在该校学生会大楼设立募兵站引起的。当时就有数百名学生高呼反对侵越战争的口号冲进大楼，举行“静坐示威”直到晚上。学校当局召来大批警察，妄图用暴力把示威学生赶出大楼。警察冲进人群中，挥舞警棍横蛮殴打手无寸铁的示威学生，遭到了后者的英勇还击。这时，大批学生闻讯赶来助战，使示威人数增加到近两千人，声势大振。他们在大楼内外同警察搏斗，并且高呼反对侵越战争的口号。
    第二天，示威学生增加到六千人。他们冒雨举行抗议集会，并一致通过决议，开展罢课斗争。坚决反对军方到校内来搞募兵活动。（附图片）
