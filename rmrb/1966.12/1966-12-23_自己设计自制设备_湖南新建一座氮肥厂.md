Edition: 2

Hunan Province's first nitrogen fertilizer plant, designed, equipped, and installed entirely by the province itself, has recently been completed and put into production in Youshan County.

The factories responsible for manufacturing the equipment for this nitrogen fertilizer plant are mostly small factories with rudimentary equipment. The broad masses of revolutionary workers, following Chairman Mao's teachings on self-reliance and striving for self-improvement, have displayed a fearless spirit and a communist style of mutual cooperation. They have overcome difficulties and successfully completed the task.

    自己设计自制设备
    湖南新建一座氮肥厂
    湖南省第一座自己设计、自己制造设备、自己安装的攸县氮肥厂，最近建成并投入生产。
    为这个氮肥厂制造设备的工厂，绝大部分是设备简陋的小厂，广大革命职工遵照毛主席关于奋发图强自力更生的教导，发扬大无畏精神和互相协作的共产主义风格，克服困难，完成了任务。
