Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought to Achieve New Victories

	Chairman Mao, you are the brightest red sun in our hearts! You trust the masses the most, care for the masses the most, and support the revolutionary movements and pioneering spirit of the masses the most. You are the most outstanding leader of the proletariat in contemporary times, the greatest genius of our era. Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest Marxism-Leninism of contemporary times. We firmly respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call and are determined to hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strive to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and truly grasp it. We will definitely follow the correct line of our great leader Chairman Mao, ride the winds and break the waves, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The soldiers of the Sixth Platoon of the Yi Ethnic Minority Regiment of the Chengdu Military Region pledge in front of Chairman Mao's portrait that they will make the People's Liberation Army, this great school of Mao Zedong Thought, even better.

	Currently, they are the advanced unit in studying Chairman Mao's works and the model platoon in the Chengdu Military Region.

	Chairman Mao said, "The Long March is a manifesto, the Long March is a propaganda team, the Long March is a seeder." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, the vast number of revolutionary youth and Red Guards in our country have formed Long March teams. They are determined to face the wind and rain and see the world during their marches, learn better from the workers and peasants, and temper themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. These are the revolutionary youngsters from the Second Middle School of Jiyuan, Henan, marching and laboring with the commune members.

	On October 27 of this year, our country successfully tested missile and nuclear weapons. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a brilliant achievement of the Cultural Revolution. These are the Young Pioneers of Xining City, Qinghai Province, celebrating the victory at the terrace field construction site in the suburbs with the commune members.

	Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's direction for literature and art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the policy of emphasizing the present, using the past for the present, and using foreign elements for Chinese purposes, our literary and artistic revolution has achieved great victories. Reforms in Peking opera, ballet, symphony music, and sculpture have all made epoch-making achievements. This is the Central Orchestra performing the symphony "Sha Jian Hu" during the high tide of the Cultural Revolution.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗夺取新的胜利
    （左图）毛主席啊，您是我们心中最红最红的红太阳！您最相信群众，最关心群众，最支持群众的革命运动和首创精神。您是当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖，是当代最伟大的天才。毛泽东思想是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义。我们坚决响应林彪同志的号召，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，努力把毛泽东思想真正学到手，真正掌握起来。我们一定沿着伟大的领袖毛主席的正确路线乘风破浪，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。
    成都部队某彝民团六连的战士在毛主席像前表示决心，一定要把人民解放军这个毛泽东思想大学校办得更好。
    现在，他们是成都部队学习毛主席著作的先进单位、四好连队标兵。
    毛主席说：“长征是宣言书，长征是宣传队，长征是播种机。”我国广大的革命青少年和红卫兵，遵照毛主席的指示，组成长征队。他们决心在步行串连中经风雨、见世面，更好地向工农学习，把自己锻炼成为坚强可靠的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。这是河南济源二中徒步串连的革命小将和社员一起劳动。
    今年十月二十七日，我国发射导弹核武器试验成功。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是文化大革命的辉煌成果。这是青海省西宁市的少先队员们，来到郊区兴建梯田的工地上，和社员们一起欢庆胜利。

    在毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务的方向和厚今薄古、古为今用、洋为中用的方针指导下，我们的文艺革命获得了伟大的胜利。京剧、芭蕾舞剧、交响音乐和雕塑改革，都取得了划时代的成就。这是中央乐团在文化大革命高潮中，演出交响音乐《沙家浜》。
