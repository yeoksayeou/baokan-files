The Little Red Book, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," has been warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses of Zanzibar in Tanzania since it appeared on the island.

A technician in Zanzibar, after reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao," told his colleagues, "This little book is a comprehensive summary of all revolutionary thoughts in the world. Anyone who wants to be a revolutionary must study this book."

He shared three key takeaways: first, one should serve the people wholeheartedly; second, when facing difficulties, one should think of the story of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains"; third, in complex situations, one should distinguish between contradictions among the people and contradictions between the enemy and us. He fluently recited many quotations from Chairman Mao to illustrate his points.

Mao's words are all correct

A leader of the Zanzibar Trade Union, Mr. Mfaume, was overjoyed upon receiving a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He said, "All revolutionaries must read this book of Chairman Mao's quotations and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, because Chairman Mao's words are all correct."

An educator in Zanzibar said, "After reading 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' we feel that Chairman Mao is very familiar with the various difficulties we encounter and teaches us how to overcome them."

Completely agree with Chairman Mao's self-reliance

Once, a leader of the Afro-Shirazi Party in Zanzibar mentioned an incident: a group of government officials returning from Pemba Island by boat gathered together to read and discuss "Quotations from Chairman Mao." This leader said they fully agree with Chairman Mao's proposal to build the country through self-reliance. He said, "We hope for foreign aid, but we cannot rely on it. We must rely on our own efforts and the creativity of all our military and civilian population."

A revolutionary youth named Hajji from Zanzibar once borrowed "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from a Zanzibari student who had studied in China. His boundless love for Mao Zedong Thought prompted him to repeatedly inquire from Chinese friends about the exact date when "Quotations from Chairman Mao" would be shipped from Beijing to the local area. One day, during a heavy downpour, upon hearing that "Quotations from Chairman Mao" had arrived, he rushed through the rain to the Chinese friends' place. When he received this long-awaited treasure, his face lit up with a smile. Despite his clothes being soaked, he immediately opened the book and began to read aloud.

We should respect Chairman Mao generation after generation

A Zanzibari worker named Yusuf, who worked with Chinese experts, after seeing Chinese comrades eagerly study Chairman Mao's works, requested that a Chinese translator explain the contents of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to him in Swahili. As he gradually understood more of Chairman Mao's teachings, Yusuf worked harder and harder. He often saluted the portrait of Chairman Mao before or after work. He also told his children, "While I am alive, you should hang the portrait of Chairman Mao in our home. After I pass away, you should continue to hang the portrait of Chairman Mao in our home. We should respect Chairman Mao generation after generation."

    《毛主席语录》是革命者必读书
    受到桑给巴尔广大革命群众的热烈欢迎
    据新华社桑给巴尔十九日电　红彤彤的《毛主席语录》在东非的坦桑尼亚桑给巴尔岛上一出现，就受到这里的广大革命群众的热烈欢迎。
    桑给巴尔的一位技术工人在阅读了《毛主席语录》以后对同事说：“《毛主席语录》这本书虽然小，但是它是世界上一切革命思想的全面总结。谁要做革命者，他就得学习这本书。”
    他举出了三点学习心得：一，应该全心全意为人民服务；二，遇到困难时，要想到《愚公移山》；三，在复杂的情况下要分清人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾。他熟练地背诵了许多毛主席语录来说明他的这些观点。
          毛主席的话都是正确的
    桑给巴尔工会领导人姆发乌梅得到一本《毛主席语录》后非常高兴。他说：“一切革命者都必须读这本《毛主席语录》，按照毛主席的指示办事，因为毛主席的话都是正确的。”
    桑给巴尔的一位教育工作者说：“读了《毛主席语录》，我们感到，毛主席十分熟悉我们碰到的种种困难，并且教导我们如何去克服这些困难。”
          完全赞同毛主席自力更生的观点
    有一次，桑给巴尔非洲—设拉子党的领导人谈到这样一件事：一批政府官员从奔巴岛乘船回桑给巴尔。在船上，他们不约而同地聚集在一起朗读和讨论《毛主席语录》。这位领导人说，他们完全赞同毛主席提出的自力更生建设国家的观点。他说：“我们希望有外援，但是我们不能依赖它，我们要依靠自己的努力，依靠全体军民的创造力。”
    一位名叫哈吉的桑给巴尔革命青年曾向在中国学习过的桑给巴尔留学生借阅《毛主席语录》。对毛泽东思想的无限热爱促使他不止一次地向中国朋友打听《毛主席语录》从北京运到当地的确切日期。一天，正下着倾盆大雨，听说《毛主席语录》到了后，他冒雨飞奔到中国朋友那里。当他拿到了这本渴望已久的宝书时，脸上露出了笑容。他不顾衣服已经湿透，立刻翻开宝书朗读起来。
                我们应当世世代代敬爱毛主席
    同中国专家一道工作的桑给巴尔工人优素福，看到中国同志如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作后，请求中国翻译同志用斯瓦希利语向他解释《毛主席语录》的内容。在渐渐地懂得更多的毛主席的教导后，优素福工作得越来越努力了。他常常在上工前或下班后，向毛主席像敬礼。他还对自己的孩子们说：“我在世的时候，你们把毛主席像挂在我们家里。我去世以后，你们也要把毛主席像继续挂在我们家里。我们应当世世代代敬爱毛主席。”
