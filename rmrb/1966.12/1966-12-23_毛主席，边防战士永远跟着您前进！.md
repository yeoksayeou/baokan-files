A car sped across the high plateau at an altitude of over 4,000 meters. This was a special vehicle dispatched by the Tibet Military Region Command to the border lines. It was carrying the golden Mao Zedong badges, Mao Zedong's works, Mao Zedong quotations, Red Guard armbands, red scarves, and letters full of revolutionary fervor sent by Red Guards and revolutionary masses from all over the country to the border guards. In November on the Tibetan Plateau, the season of ice and snow had arrived, making it difficult for the car to climb the snow-covered mountains. But the driver thought of the mission entrusted by millions of revolutionaries to deliver the Mao Zedong badges, of the comrades' red hearts loving Chairman Mao, of their longing to receive the Mao Zedong badges, and of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory." All difficulties, including the severe cold and snow-covered mountains, were cast aside.

The Mao Zedong badges have arrived!

The news that Mao Zedong badges sent by Red Guards and revolutionary workers from all over the country would soon arrive spread like a spring breeze throughout the border units of the Tibet Military Region. In the snow-covered trenches, on the icy patrol routes, in the sentry posts, on the training grounds, and in the fields, border guards rushed to tell each other. The songs "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" echoed along the border lines. The soldiers, to welcome the Mao Zedong badges sent by their loved ones, decorated the place like celebrating a festival, with everyone wearing new uniforms, and everywhere filled with joy.

On the border lines, separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, the soldiers' hearts turned to Chairman Mao. On the frontier posts, it was difficult to buy a portrait of Chairman Mao, let alone a Mao Zedong badge. Even if they saw a picture of Chairman Mao, they would paste it in the barracks or in their notebooks. If they obtained a Mao Zedong badge, they would treasure it as a precious gem, taking turns to wear it. Now, class brothers and sisters from all over the country knew of their love for Chairman Mao and sent them the most precious gift, how could they not feel a surge of warmth in their hearts and tears in their eyes? How could they not sing "The East Is Red" and sing the praises of the great Mao Zedong Thought?

At that time, some comrades were so happy that they were calculating the date of the special car's arrival. A border unit's soldiers and officers calculated that the special car carrying the Mao Zedong badges would soon arrive. They immediately lined up in formation, waving red flags, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao and quotation boards, and went out to welcome the car, drumming and cheering in the cold wind. They waited and waited! As the sun set, the special car was still not in sight. Everyone began to discuss anxiously: Could it be that the car broke down on the way? Could it be that the heavy snow blocked the road, preventing the car from passing?... As the sky filled with dense stars, the cold wind blew in gusts, piercing the bones, but the border guards' red hearts were burning with thoughts of Chairman Mao. They lit lanterns and torches, continuing to wait for the happy moment. Later, they suddenly realized that the time calculation was wrong; the special car would arrive the next day, not that day. Although they had waited in vain for an afternoon, no one was tired or complained. Many comrades stood guard and patrolled that night, thinking of Chairman Mao and the Mao Zedong badges they were about to receive. One soldier even dreamed of shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The next afternoon, they lined up again to welcome the car. Waving red flags, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao, and drumming and cheering, they waited. That day, time seemed to pass especially slowly; waiting for an hour felt longer than patrolling for a day. Night fell, and the soldiers lit torches and lanterns, reading Chairman Mao's quotations, singing, and the stirring sound of drums and cheers echoed through the valleys.

At 9 o'clock sharp, the sound of engines and lights pierced the darkness. "It's here! The Mao Zedong badges have arrived!" The soldiers' eyes welled up with tears, and they waved Mao Zedong's quotation books, shouting, "Chairman Mao! Border guards miss you day and night!" "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years!"

Like standing by Chairman Mao's side

Soldiers Zhao Peitian, Wang Zhenya, and Li Shutian are all sons of poor peasants. They have an infinite love, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao, thinking of him day and night. It was these three who, on behalf of all the border guards, first wrote to the People's Daily, hoping to receive Mao Zedong badges.

When they heard that their loved ones from various places had sent the long-awaited Mao Zedong badges, they were so moved that tears of happiness flowed. To receive the Mao Zedong badges, these three traveled from over a hundred miles away. Zhao Peitian traveled the farthest, covering 230 miles, crossing 18 mountain gullies and 18 rivers, eating only two meals in a day and a half. He cursed his legs for walking too slowly, wishing he could grow wings to fly to the destination. When the unit leader, Comrade Dong Shuwen, personally pinned the Mao Zedong badges and Mao Zedong quotation badges on the chests of these three soldiers who loved Chairman Mao, they felt as if they were standing by the side of their most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, listening to his teachings, feeling like the happiest people in the world.... Wang Zhenya, facing the Mao Zedong badge, swore: "Even if my head is cut off and my blood flows, I will never abandon Mao Zedong Thought, and I will pass it on to future generations." They said: "Wearing the Mao Zedong badge, forever united with the Red Guards, forever united with the people, rooted in the frontier, red heart towards the sun. Wearing the Mao Zedong badge, forever following Chairman Mao to make revolution. Defend Mao Zedong Thought resolutely, let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly in the five continents and four seas."

Who should wear it?

The entire unit of a certain border company, which has been stationed at the foot of the Himalayas for years and has been rated as a model unit for four consecutive years, joyfully received five Mao Zedong badges. The border guards all cherished them, wanting to wear them on their chests to let Chairman Mao's thoughts shine on their bodies. However, there were so many people in the entire squad, and five Mao Zedong badges were not enough to distribute. Who should wear them? This was a difficult question for the leaders. They specially convened a party branch meeting to discuss it. Some said that the mess hall comrades were the hardest working and should wear the badges; others said that the five-star soldiers should wear them. Finally, after discussion, everyone agreed to give them to five active learners of Mao Zedong's works.

One border squad received two Mao Zedong badges. Who should wear them? After discussion, everyone agreed that the Red Guards and revolutionary workers had sent the most precious Mao Zedong badges to the border guards, which was the highest honor from the people of the whole country. Only those who studied Mao Zedong's works well should wear them. Who studied the best? Everyone agreed that whoever spoke well at the monthly study sessions of Mao Zedong's works should wear them. Monthly evaluations, everyone striving to wear them.

Another border squad also received two Mao Zedong badges. The soldiers all regarded them as priceless treasures, the source of strength. They decided that one should be worn by the comrade who walks in front during each patrol, symbolizing that with Chairman Mao guiding, they would never lose their way and would always march from victory to victory. The other one should be worn by whoever speaks at the unit's study sessions of Mao Zedong's works. Everyone could see Chairman Mao, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

The unit where the combat hero Xiao Mingsheng served received one Mao Zedong badge. The entire unit discussed and decided to keep it as a "family heirloom." The golden Mao Zedong badge would inspire everyone to be like Xiao Mingsheng, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loving Chairman Mao, and defending the southwestern border of the motherland.

Another unit, after receiving the Mao Zedong badges, had a serious discussion. They believed that only the units and individuals who held the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought highest, and the collectives and individuals who did well in eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit, could enjoy this honor. They unanimously agreed that the "Chagula Red Border Guard Team" who said, "I do not miss the beautiful scenery of my hometown, I am willing to share a hundred years with the snow mountains," the "Iron Transportation Team on the Tibetan Plateau," and the government officials who worked tirelessly all year round, sharing weal and woe with the Tibetan people, should wear the Mao Zedong badges. They drummed and cheered, sending a golden Mao Zedong badge to the county committee and sending two Mao Zedong badges to two heroic units. In addition, they kept one for the patriotic youth who loved and supported the construction of the border.

Chairman Mao's light shines in our hearts

It was deep into the night, but the border guards had no sleep. To respond to the greatest encouragement and care from the people of the motherland, some border guards were still bent over their desks, writing letters to their loved ones under the kerosene lamp. They told their loved ones that they had proudly worn the Mao Zedong badges. A soldier wrote in his letter, filled with excitement:

"Mao Zedong badge,
Each one shines with golden light;
Loved ones and soldiers' hearts are connected,
Thousands of mountains and rivers sent to the border.
Border guards wear it on their chests,
A red sun rises in their hearts;
Strength is added, eyes are bright,
Swear to hold the gun and defend the border."

The border guards unanimously promised the people of the motherland: Remember that they are the sons of the people, the good offspring of poor and lower-middle peasants, be good soldiers of Chairman Mao, take the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, like Cai Yongxiang, devote themselves to the revolution, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the people of the motherland, and defend the southwestern gate of the motherland. If the U.S. imperialists and Indian reactionaries dare to invade, they will resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate them.

The editor's note: After our newspaper published on October 12 a letter from the Tibetan border guards hoping to receive Mao Zedong badges, Red Guards and revolutionary masses from various places sent many golden Mao Zedong badges and Mao Zedong quotation badges. After the Tibetan border guards received these precious gifts forwarded by our newspaper, they shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" repeatedly. They were so moved by the class-friendly feelings of the Red Guards and revolutionary masses from all over the country that they shed tears. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the incident of sending Mao Zedong badges over thousands of miles vividly showed that the great Mao Zedong Thought shines on the hearts of revolutionaries across the country, showing that every red heart is turned towards our great leader Chairman Mao!

After receiving the Mao Zedong badges, the border guards decided to read Chairman Mao's books better, listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. They decided to forever follow Chairman Mao to make the revolution and defend the socialist mountains and rivers. They wrote many letters full of revolutionary enthusiasm to the Red Guards and revolutionary masses in various places, expressing their gratitude.

Today, we publish here the report by Cang Xin, introducing the moving scenes when the border guards received the Mao Zedong badges, and excerpt some of the letters and poems from the border guards.

专栏：

    毛主席，边防战士永远跟着您前进！
    一辆汽车，在拔海四千多米的高原上，急速地奔驰着。这是西藏军区领导机关派往边防线上的一辆专车，它要把全国各地红卫兵和革命群众寄给边防战士的金光闪闪的毛主席像章、毛主席著作、毛主席语录章、红卫兵袖章、红领巾和一封封充满火热革命激情的信送到边防战士手中去。西藏高原的十一月，已进入千里冰封、万里雪飘的季节，汽车爬雪山时行车很困难。可司机一想到送毛主席像章是千万革命人民的委托，想到战友们热爱毛主席的红心，想到他们渴望得到毛主席像章的心情，想到毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”什么严寒，什么雪山冰河，一切困难全抛到九霄云外了。
    毛主席像章送来了！
    祖国各地的红卫兵和革命职工寄给西藏边防战士的毛主席像章就要送到的喜讯，像春风般迅速传遍西藏军区的边防部队。在大雪茫茫的堑壕里，在冰天雪地巡逻的途中，在哨所内，在练兵场上，在劳动的田头地边，边防战士们奔走相告。《东方红》《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声响彻边防线上。战士们为了迎接亲人们寄来的毛主席像章，如同欢度佳节，张灯结彩，人人穿上了新军装，到处喜气洋洋。
    战士们在边防线上，隔着千山万水，心向毛主席。在边疆的岗位上，不容易买到毛主席像，更不容易得到毛主席像章。哪怕是只看到一张毛主席像的图片，他们也要贴在军营，放在本子里，要是得到一枚毛主席像章，他们就如获至宝一样，大家轮流戴。现在全国各地的阶级兄弟姐妹知道了他们热爱毛主席的心情，给他们送来这最最珍贵的礼品，叫他们怎么不心头热浪滚、眼中热泪涌呢？叫他们怎么不放声歌唱《东方红》，放声歌唱伟大的毛泽东思想呢？
      当时，有的同志欢喜得直在推算专车到达的日期。一支边防部队的指战员，计算送毛主席像章的专车就要到达了，立刻排好队，打着红旗，抬着毛主席像和语录牌，冒着寒风，敲锣打鼓去迎接。等呀，等呀！眼看太阳已落山，还不见送礼品的专车来。大家焦急地议论开了：莫不是汽车在途中抛了锚？莫不是雪大封了山，阻住了汽车的通路？……眼看天空已现出密密的繁星，寒风一阵紧一阵，冷得刺骨，但边防战士想念毛主席的颗颗红心是火热的。他们挑起灯笼，燃起松明，依旧在等待幸福时刻的到来。后来，忽然发现时间计算错了，专车不是当天，而是次日才能到达。虽然白白等了一下午，但谁也没有一点倦意，没有半点怨言。不少同志当晚站哨、执勤都在想念毛主席，想着就要得到的毛主席像章。有个战士作梦还在想，在睡梦中高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    第二天下午，他们又排好欢迎的队伍。打着红旗，抬着毛主席像，敲着锣鼓迎接。这天时间似乎过的格外慢，等一小时好像比巡逻一天还要长。天黑下来了，战士们一齐燃起松明和灯笼，朗读毛主席语录声、歌声和激动人心的锣鼓声，响彻山谷。
    九时整，远处传来了阵阵的马达声，灯光划破了黑夜。“来了来了，毛主席像章送来了！”战士们眼里淌着热泪，手里不断地挥动着毛主席语录本，高呼：“毛主席！边防战士日夜想念你！”“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”
    就像站在毛主席身边
    战士赵培田、王振亚、李书田，都是贫农的儿子，他们对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，日日夜夜想念毛主席。是他们三个人，代表了全体边防战士的心意和愿望，首先写信给《人民日报》，希望得到毛主席像章的。
    当他们听到各地亲人们寄来了久已盼望的毛主席像章时，感动得流出了幸福的眼泪。为了接受毛主席像章，他们三个人都是从百里以外赶来。赵培田最远，走了二百三十里路，沿途翻了十八个山沟，过了十八条河流，在一天半时间内只吃到两餐饭。他恨自己的腿走得太慢，恨不得长上翅膀一下飞到目的地。当部队领导人董书文同志，亲手把毛主席像章和毛主席语录章，戴在这三位热爱毛主席的战士胸前时，他们感到自己好像就站在最最敬爱的领袖毛主席身旁，在聆听毛主席的教导，感到自己是世界上最幸福的人。……王振亚对着毛主席像章宣誓：头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想绝对不能丢，要把它传给子孙后代。他们说：“戴上毛主席像章，和红卫兵小将永远心连心，和人民永远心连心，扎根在边疆，红心向太阳。戴上毛主席像章，永远跟着毛主席干革命。坚决捍卫毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在五洲四海飘扬。”
    给谁戴上？
    终年驻守在喜马拉雅山脚下，连续四年评为四好连队、学习毛主席著作标兵单位的某边防连队全体指战员，欣喜地得到了五枚毛主席像章。边防战士们人人都爱不释手，都想戴在自己胸前，让毛主席的思想光辉照耀全身。可是全分队那样多人，五枚毛主席像章不够分配，给谁戴最好呢？这可难坏了领导人。他们专门召开党支委会研究，决定把问题交给大家讨论。有的说，炊事班同志最辛苦，应该让炊事班的同志戴；有的说，五好战士戴上合适；最后讨论结果，大家一致同意给五名学习毛主席著作积极分子戴上。
    有一个边防分队得到两枚毛主席像章。谁戴最合适？大家研究结果，认为：红卫兵和革命职工给边防战士送来了最珍贵的毛主席像章，这是全国人民给边防战士的最高荣誉，只有毛主席著作学习得好的同志戴上最合适。谁学的最好呢？大家意见是每月召开学习毛主席著作讲用会，谁讲用得好，谁戴。月月评，人人争先戴。
    另一个边防分队也得到两枚毛主席像章。指战员们都把它看成无价之宝，看成力量的源泉。大家商议，决定一枚给每次执勤、巡逻时走在前边的同志戴上，表示有毛主席给大家指引航路，永远不会迷失方向，永远由胜利走向胜利。另一枚，连队讲毛主席著作时，谁讲谁就戴上它。大家都能看到毛主席，更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
    战斗英雄萧明生生前所在的班，得到了一枚毛主席像章。全班讨论结果：作为班里的“传家宝”。金光闪闪的毛主席像章，将鼓舞每个人都要像萧明生一样，无限忠于毛主席，无限热爱毛主席，保卫祖国西南边疆。
    另一支部队得到了毛主席像章后，进行了认真的讨论，他们认为只有毛泽东思想红旗举得最高的单位和个人，只有破私立公做得好的集体和个人，才能享受这一荣誉。他们一致认为，“不念家乡景色艳，愿与雪山共百年”的查果拉红色边防队、西藏高原钢铁运输班和终年不辞劳苦、和藏族人民同甘共苦的政府工作人员，才应该戴上毛主席像章。他们敲锣打鼓把一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章送给了县委，把两枚毛主席像章分别寄给了两个英雄单位。此外，还给热爱边疆、支援边疆建设的有志青年保存了一枚。
    毛主席的光芒照心上
    夜深了，边防战士们却没有一点睡意。为了回答祖国人民给自己最大的鼓舞，最大的关怀，一些边防战士还伏在桌上，在煤油灯下，给亲人们写回信。告诉亲人，自己光荣地戴上了毛主席像章。一位战士在回信中万分激动地写了一首诗：
    “毛主席像章，
    颗颗闪金光；
    亲人战士心连心，
    千山万水寄边疆。
    边防战士戴胸前，
    心中升起红太阳；
    力量猛添眼雪亮，
    誓死握枪保边防。”
    边防战士一致向祖国人民保证：牢记自己是人民子弟兵，贫下中农的好后生，做毛主席的好战士，以“老三篇”为座右铭，破私立公，像蔡永祥那样，一心为革命，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于祖国人民，保卫好祖国西南大门。如果美帝国主义和印度反动派胆敢侵犯，就坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把它们消灭光。
              藏新
    编者的话：本报十月十二日刊登了西藏边防战士希望得到毛主席像章的一封信后，各地红卫兵和革命群众纷纷寄来了很多金光闪闪的毛主席像章、毛主席语录章等。西藏边防战士们，在收到本报转去这些珍贵的礼物后，他们不住地欢呼“毛主席万岁！”他们为全国各地红卫兵、革命群众的这种阶级友爱的情意感动得流泪。在无产阶级文化大革命中，出现万里赠送毛主席像章这样的事，生动地显示了伟大毛泽东思想的光辉普照着五湖四海革命人们的心，显示了颗颗红心向着我们伟大领袖毛主席！
    边防战士收到毛主席像章后，决心要更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，决心永远跟毛主席干革命，保卫社会主义江山。他们给各地红卫兵和革命群众写了许多充满革命热情的信，表示感谢。
    今天，在这里发表了藏新写的通讯，介绍边防战士收到毛主席像章时的动人情景，并摘登了边防战士一部分来信和诗稿。
