The cadres and community members building the Ganxi Waterwheel Pumping Station in Hengdong County, Hunan Province, are actively studying and applying the "Old Three Articles" on the construction site. Everyone is spirited and full of enthusiasm, and the entire site is filled with a revolutionary atmosphere of fervor. The progress of the project has been significantly accelerated. The 1.86 million cubic meters of earthwork originally planned to be completed in four months has been completed by 80% in just one and a half months. The 340,000 cubic meters of rock work has also been completed by more than 65%.

The Ganxi Waterwheel Pumping Station is one of the largest waterwheel pumping stations in Hunan Province at present. After its completion, it can irrigate more than 130,000 mu of farmland. Along the 150-mile-long construction site, nearly 2,000 study groups of Chairman Mao's works have been established, and more than 670 communist night schools have been set up. After studying the "Old Three Articles," the cadres and community members have undergone a tremendous change in their spiritual outlook. Many people are eager to take on difficult tasks and compete to do dangerous work. New people and new deeds are emerging in large numbers, powerfully promoting the progress of the project.

    活学活用“老三篇”　精神面貌大改变
    甘溪水轮泵站工程进展迅速
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省衡东县建设甘溪水轮泵站的干部和社员，在工地上活学活用“老三篇”，人人精神振奋，个个干劲冲天，整个工地充满热气腾腾的革命气氛，工程进度大大加快。原计划四个月才能完工的一百八十六万土方工程，只用一个半月时间就已完成了百分之八十，三十四万石方工程，也已完成了百分之六十五以上。
    甘溪水轮泵站，是目前湖南省最大的水轮泵站之一，它建成以后，可以灌溉十三万多亩农田。在绵延一百五十里长的工地上，建立了近两千个毛主席著作学习小组，办起了六百七十多所共产主义夜校。干部社员在学习了“老三篇”以后，精神面貌发生了巨大变化，许多人都是见难就上，争干险工，新人新事大量涌现，有力地推动了工程的进展。
