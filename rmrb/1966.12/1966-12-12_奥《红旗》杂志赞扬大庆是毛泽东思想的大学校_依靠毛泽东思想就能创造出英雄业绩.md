The Austrian Marxist-Leninist Organization's organ, the "Red Flag" magazine, recently published an article by Karl Horn, which highly praises the revolutionary spirit of the people of Daqing in their self-reliant and arduous struggle under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The article describes today's Daqing as a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Karl Horn visited China during the National Day celebrations this year. In an article titled "Visiting the Oil Workers of Daqing," he wrote that the Chinese people, with their revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, overcame the difficulties caused by Soviet revisionists. They relied on the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong to achieve unparalleled socialist heroic feats.

The article discusses the spirit of arduous struggle of the people of Daqing, stating: "It is precisely because of this remarkable socialist fighting spirit that the people of Daqing have achieved victory in their struggle against all hardships. Today, the people of Daqing and their revolutionary spirit are not only famous nationwide but have also become a model for the entire nation. Their actions are also renowned abroad."

The article states: "The Chinese workers and engineers have indeed made heroic efforts. They have relied on the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong to create new, highly modern machines and equipment."

The article highly praises the system in Daqing that combines education with labor. The article points out, "Precisely because classes and production are directly combined in Daqing, while cultivating people to master advanced technology, it truly realizes the revolutionization of people, the revolutionization of people's thoughts, and the revolutionization of political consciousness."

The article further points out, "With the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, schools and production units, theory and practice, mental labor and physical labor will no longer be separated. The entire Daqing is today a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, where class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation are closely combined."

The article concludes: "Daqing shows people that by mastering the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, one can boldly lead China out of its backward state of several hundred years and turn it into a highly industrialized country. Daqing also tells us that if people study the works of the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time and apply them in practice, they can achieve victory in the struggle against American imperialism and modern revisionism."

    奥《红旗》杂志赞扬大庆是毛泽东思想的大学校
    依靠毛泽东思想就能创造出英雄业绩
    新华社十日讯　维也纳消息：奥地利马克思列宁主义者组织机关刊物《红旗》杂志不久前发表了卡尔·霍恩写的一篇文章，高度赞扬大庆人在毛泽东思想的指引下，奋发图强、艰苦创业的革命精神，称赞今天的大庆是一所毛泽东思想的大学校。
    卡尔·霍恩在今年国庆期间访问过我国。他在一篇题为《访问大庆石油工人》的文章中说，中国人民“以自力更生的革命精神克服了由苏联修正主义者造成的困难，他们依靠了毛泽东同志的学说，作出了无可比拟的社会主义的英雄业绩。”
    文章在谈到大庆人艰苦创业的精神时写道：“正因为具有这种了不起的社会主义的斗争勇气，大庆人在和一切艰难困苦的斗争中取得了胜利。今天，大庆人和他们的革命精神，不仅在全国闻名，并成为全国的榜样，而且，他们的行动也名扬国外。”
    文章说：“中国的工人和工程师的确付出了英勇的劳动。他们依靠了毛泽东同志的学说，造出了新的、最现代化的机器和设备。”
    文章对大庆实行教育与劳动相结合的制度给予高度的评价。文章指出，“正因为在大庆上课和生产直接结合在一起，所以，在培养人们掌握高度技术的同时，也真正实现了人的革命化，人的思想的革命化和政治觉悟的革命化。”
    文章接着指出，“随着无产阶级文化大革命的开展，学校和生产单位之间、理论和实践之间、脑力劳动和体力劳动之间将不再脱节。整个大庆，今天是一所毛泽东思想的大学校，在这里可以看到阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验紧密地结合在一起。”
    文章最后写道：“大庆向人们表明，掌握了天才的毛泽东思想，就能够大胆地使中国摆脱几百年来的落后状态，并且把它变成一个高度工业化的国家。大庆也告诉我们，如果人们很好地学习当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者的著作并把它应用于实践，就能在反对美帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争中取得胜利。”
