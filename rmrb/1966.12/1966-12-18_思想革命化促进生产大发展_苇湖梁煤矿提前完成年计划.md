The revolutionary workers of all ethnic groups at the Weihu Liang Coal Mine in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have been continuously arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, promoting ideological revolutionization, and thus driving the rapid development of coal mine production. According to statistics, this coal mine has already completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule, with coal production increasing by 33.3% compared to the same period last year. Major economic indicators such as labor productivity, raw coal cost, timber consumption, and recovery rate have all been completed better than the state's requirements. This coal mine has now leaped into the ranks of the advanced units in the national coal system.

The Weihu Liang Coal Mine, which includes workers from six ethnic groups such as Uygur, Kazakh, and Han, has since its completion in 1958, annually exceeded the state's production plan, with production increasing year by year.

    苇湖梁煤矿提前完成年计划
    新疆维吾尔自治区苇湖梁煤矿各族革命职工，不断用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，促进了思想革命化，从而推动煤矿生产迅速发展。据统计，这个煤矿已经提前完成了今年的生产计划，煤炭产量比去年同期提高百分之三十三点三。主要经济指标包括全员工效、原煤成本、坑木消耗和回采率等，完成的情况都优于国家的规定。这个煤矿已经跃入全国煤炭系统的先进行列。
    包括维吾尔、哈萨克、汉等六个民族工人的苇湖梁煤矿，自一九五八年建成以来，年年超额完成国家生产计划，产量一年比一年提高。
