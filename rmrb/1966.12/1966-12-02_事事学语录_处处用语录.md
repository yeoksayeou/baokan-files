Title: Learn from Quotations in Everything, Apply Quotations Everywhere

Every day when I write the quotation boards, I tailor them to the specific situation at hand. In the past, we planted rice seedlings in a disorderly manner, like chicken eggs and duck eggs. This year, we are planting "crab-claw seedlings" using a string method. At the beginning, some women said, "This year's seedlings are going to kill us! We'll be planting until the sixth of June!" "In the past, we didn't use strings and still managed to produce grain!" Hearing these comments, I thought, these are active thoughts. I wrote two quotations: "Resolutely overcome difficulties, dare to struggle and dare to win," and "In the world, the most fearsome thing is the word 'serious.' The Communist Party is the most serious." I took these to the fields, reading and discussing them with everyone. I explained to them: If we do not practice scientific farming, how can we increase production? Following Chairman Mao's words will not lead us astray. Aren't we always saying that we do as Chairman Mao says? Everyone felt this made sense and had no more objections.

After the thoughts were aligned, the work was still slow, with only two or three acres planted each day. How could we improve efficiency? I noticed that Fang Hua Ying planted quickly and straight, so I wrote the following quotation: "We must learn from all the experts (no matter who they are) in economic work. We should treat them as our teachers, learn from them respectfully, and learn from them sincerely." I led by example, learning and planting seedlings the new way, encouraging everyone to learn from Fang Hua Ying. This way, the seedlings were planted faster and better, with efficiency increasing to six or seven acres per day. Everyone said, "With Mao Zedong Thought, we can overcome all difficulties." When half of the seedlings were planted, some women's fingers hurt and they were tired. I wrote the following quotation: "Promote the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous battle (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." After learning this quotation, everyone raised their spirits, gathered their courage, and persevered to complete the task of planting seedlings.

    事事学语录　处处用语录
    江苏省邗江县方巷大队文化室　许吉风
    我每天写语录牌时，都是针对当时当地的情况。我们过去栽秧是鸡蛋棵子，鸭蛋行子，乱栽棵；今年是拉绳子栽“蟹钳秧”。一开始有些妇女说：“今年的秧还要把人栽死了呢！要栽到六月六呢！”“过去没有拉绳子还不是照样打粮食！”听了这些话，我想，这是活思想，我就写了两条语录，一条是“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”一条是“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”带到田头，边读边谈。我向大家宣传：如果不实行科学种田，怎样能增产呢？听毛主席的话是不会错的。我们不是天天讲毛主席怎样说的，我们就怎样做吗？大家听了，觉得很有道理，就没有意见了。
    思想通了，但是还是栽得慢，每天只栽二、三亩。怎样提高工效呢？我发现方华英栽的既快又直，就写了这样一段语录：“我们必须向一切内行的人们（不管什么人）学经济工作。拜他们做老师，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学。”我自己带头学，带头照新法子栽秧，鼓励大家向方华英学习。这样，秧越栽越快，越栽越好，工效提高到每天六、七亩。大家都说：“有了毛泽东思想，就能排除一切困难。”秧栽了一半的时候，有些妇女手指栽痛了，人也疲劳，我就写了这样一条语录：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”大家学了这条语录，都提起精神，鼓起勇气，坚持栽下去，胜利地完成了栽秧任务。
