The first batch of refugees returning from Indonesia aboard the Guanghua ship, after being settled in the state-owned Yangchun Forest Farm in October, have been diligently studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They actively participate in the construction of the forest farm, consciously carry out ideological remolding, and do many good deeds.

After settling down, the refugees eagerly studied Chairman Mao's works. In addition to group study, they all carried "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them for study at any time. Cai Wenxiu, whose husband was killed by the Indonesian reactionaries and who has ten children, not only studied on her own but also often helped other women with lower cultural levels to study. Many young returnees also set up "study gardens" to share their experiences and insights on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, spreading good deeds. Ou Jiqiang, a returnee from a very poor background settled in the Hongxing Production Team, always paid attention to breaking private interests and establishing public interests. He chose the heaviest work in labor, arrived at work the earliest, and left the latest. Seeing that the well was deep and the wellhead was large, making it inconvenient for the elderly and children to draw water, he took the initiative to install an iron pulley with a wooden frame on the well to make it easier for everyone to draw water.

Many new returnees, following Chairman Mao's teachings, learned from White-seeking, Lei Feng, Liu Yingjun, and Jiao Yulu, doing good deeds with the spirit of "selflessly serving others." Some young people volunteered to accumulate fertilizer for the production team, carry water to the public toilets, and help the elderly who lack labor. Fifty-year-old returnee Xie Yaoming found a gold ring in the toilet's water tank and immediately looked for the owner, returning the ring to its rightful owner.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, December 30th: Under the personal care of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, the second batch of Indonesian refugees in Zhanjiang received proper reception and good medical treatment.

Our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, as well as Premier Zhou Enlai, after the first batch of Indonesian victims returned to the motherland, sent the Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Liao Chengzhi, to visit the refugees in Zhanjiang. As soon as the second batch of Indonesian refugees arrived in Zhanjiang, Liao Chengzhi sent a telegram to convey Chairman Mao's, Vice Chairman Lin's, and Premier Zhou's warm concern and greetings. Our great leader's care for the returning refugees brought immense warmth and great encouragement to the returning refugees and overseas Chinese, and it greatly inspired all the reception staff, becoming a powerful driving force for them to do their best in receiving the refugees. The reception staff unanimously expressed that they must understand Chairman Mao's intentions, do their best, and ensure that the victims receive the best care and treatment, so that they can quickly recover their health and not disappoint Chairman Mao's entrustment and expectations.

The second batch of Indonesian victims returning to the country suffered even more brutal persecution from the Indonesian reactionaries. Many refugees were injured and sick. The number of injured and sick patients who needed immediate hospitalization increased by more than onefold compared to the previous batch. Medical staff repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Three Articles," determined to follow the spirit of Dr. Norman Bethune's extreme responsibility to his work and extreme dedication to his comrades and the people, working day and night to treat the refugee patients. Forty-one refugee youths who were severely tortured in Indonesian prisons had their health severely damaged. In the past two days, medical staff conducted comprehensive physical examinations and X-ray examinations for them and designated neurologists as well as internal and external medicine doctors to consult and treat the youths who suffered brain concussions due to beatings. A group of refugee children with colds, who did not receive treatment in the Indonesian "refugee camp" and developed into pneumonia, measles, and whooping cough, gradually recovered their health after returning to Zhanjiang and receiving careful treatment and nursing from medical staff.

The property of this batch of returning refugees was almost completely plundered by the Indonesian reactionaries. The reception staff visited each household, understanding and helping them solve problems related to living expenses, clothing, and daily necessities.

After the news of Chairman Mao's great concern for the returning overseas Chinese was published in the newspapers, many revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country who came to Zhanjiang to connect actively and enthusiastically participated in the reception work.

Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial Committee for Receiving and Settling Returning Overseas Chinese, Zeng Sheng, and many revolutionary students and Red Guards, visited the refugees' living quarters and hospitals to comfort the families of refugees whose relatives were killed by the Indonesian reactionaries and the seriously ill refugees, and expressed respect to the patriotic overseas Chinese, especially the forty-one refugee youths.

Forty-one overseas Chinese youths were illegally detained for forty days by the reactionary military authorities in Medan, Indonesia. The severe torture and harsh living conditions of the reactionaries severely damaged their health. This is the medical staff in Zhanjiang examining their bodies.

    自觉进行思想改造  大学大做好人好事
    首批归国难侨认真活学活用毛主席著作
    第二批回国的印尼受害华侨受到妥善接待和良好医疗
    新华社广州三十日电　首批乘光华轮从印度尼西亚回国的难侨，今年十月间在国营阳春林场得到妥善安置后，认真活学活用毛主席著作，积极参加林场建设，自觉地进行思想改造，大学大做好人好事。
    难侨们安居下来后，便如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。他们除了集体学习外，都随身携带《毛主席语录》，随时进行学习。丈夫被印尼反动派杀害、有十个孩子的蔡文秀，在自学的同时，还经常帮助其他文化比自己低的妇女学习。许多归侨青年还办了“学习园地”，介绍活学活用毛主席著作的体会和经验，传播好人好事。安置在红星生产队的出身十分贫苦的归侨欧继强，处处注意破私立公，劳动中他专拣重活做，上班最早，收工最迟；他看到水井深、井口大，老人和小孩打水不方便，就主动拿出自己的铁滑轮，用木架安装在水井上，以方便大家打水。
    许多新归侨按照毛主席的教导，向白求恩、雷锋、刘英俊、焦裕禄等同志学习，用“毫不利己专门利人”的精神大做好事。有些青年人争着义务为生产队积肥，往公共厕所里挑水，帮助缺乏劳动力的老人干活。五十多岁的归侨谢耀铭在厕所的水池里拾到一个金戒指，马上寻找失主，把金戒指还给本人。
    据新华社湛江三十日电　在我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下，第二批归国的印尼难侨在湛江得到了妥善的接待和良好的医疗。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席以及周恩来总理，在第一批回国的印尼受害华侨回到祖国后，曾派华侨事务委员会主任廖承志专程到湛江市看望难侨。第二批回国印尼难侨刚刚到达湛江，廖承志又打来电报，向他们转达毛主席、林副主席和周总理的亲切关怀和慰问。我们的伟大领袖对归国难侨的关怀，给了归国难侨和海外广大华侨无限的温暖和巨大的鼓舞，同时也极大地鼓舞了全体接侨工作人员，成为他们全心全意、好上加好地做好接待难侨工作的巨大动力。接侨工作人员一致表示，一定要好好体会毛主席的心意，竭尽全力做好工作，使受害侨胞得到最好的照顾和治疗，让他们迅速恢复健康，不辜负毛主席的重托和期望。
    第二批回国的印尼受害华侨由于受到印尼反动派更加残酷迫害，许多难侨受伤和患病。需要马上送进医院治疗的伤病员，比上一批增加了一倍以上。医务人员反复学习毛主席的“老三篇”，决心以白求恩同志对工作极端负责任和对同志对人民极端热忱的精神，不分日夜地为难侨病人治疗。在印尼监狱中遭受反动派严刑拷打过的四十一名难侨青少年，身体受到严重的摧残。这两天，医务人员为他们做了全面的身体检查和透视检查，还指定神经科以及内、外科医生，为被拷打而致脑震荡的青少年会诊和治疗。一批患了感冒的难侨儿童，因为在印尼的难侨“收容所”里得不到治疗，病情发展成为肺炎、麻疹和百日咳。他们回到湛江后，经过医务人员认真诊治和细心护理，现在都逐渐恢复健康。
    这批归国难侨的财产，几乎被印尼反动派掠夺一空。接侨工作人员挨户访问，了解和帮助他们解决零用钱、被服、日用品等生活困难问题。
    毛主席非常关怀归国侨胞的消息在报纸上发表后，从全国各地到湛江串连的许多革命师生和红卫兵，积极热情地参加了接侨工作。
    广东省副省长、广东省接待和安置归国华侨委员会副主任委员曾生等以及许多革命师生和红卫兵，纷纷到难侨住地和医院，慰问亲人被印尼反动派杀害的难侨家属和重病难侨，并向爱国侨胞特别是四十一名难侨青少年表示敬意。（附图片）
    四十一名华侨青少年，被印尼棉兰陆军当局无理监禁四十天。反动派的严刑拷打和恶劣的生活条件，使他们的健康受到严重摧残。这是湛江市医务人员正为他们检查身体。
