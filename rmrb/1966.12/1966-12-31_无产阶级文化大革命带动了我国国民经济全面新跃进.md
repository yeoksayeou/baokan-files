The great Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the broad masses, will produce tremendous material force. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has promoted a comprehensive leap forward in China's national economy. The tasks for the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan have been completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled.

This is a great encouragement to all the revolutionary people of China and the world, and a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries.

The New China News Agency reported on the 30th that the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has greatly inspired and aroused the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of workers and commune members on the economic front, thus bringing about a new look and new prosperity to China's entire national economy.

The tasks for the first year of China's Third Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy have been completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled.

Agriculture has overcome relatively severe natural disasters and achieved an all-around bumper harvest. The grain and cotton yields are the best in the 17 years since liberation; various economic crops, as well as forestry and animal husbandry, are all in a situation of high yields, with production significantly exceeding that of last year.

Industrial production has increased across the board. Industries such as steel, machinery, coal, petroleum, electricity, chemicals, building materials, timber logging, as well as textiles and light industry, have all completed their production increase plans ahead of schedule and overfulfilled them. The variety of products has increased significantly, and the quality has generally improved. The total industrial output value has increased by more than 20% compared to last year.

The basic construction tasks in industry and agriculture have been well completed. The completed investment and engineering projects have far exceeded those of last year. The construction period of many important projects has been shortened by about half compared to the past, and the quality of the projects has also significantly improved.

The transportation and logistics sector has undertaken the task of transporting tens of millions of revolutionary students and teachers for the Great Link-up this year, and the total freight volume has still overfulfilled the state plan.

Science and technology have made leapfrog developments. The success of three consecutive nuclear tests this year, the successful synthesis of benzene, the creation of synthetic crystalline insulin, and the emergence of a complete set of new oil extraction and refining technologies in Daqing, all mark that China's science and technology have begun to enter the advanced level of the 1960s.

In the face of all-around bumper harvests in agriculture and all-around increases in industrial production, the national market has seen a boom in both purchases and sales, with the volume of commodity procurement and sales significantly increasing compared to last year.

China's import and export trade situation and the state's fiscal revenue and expenditure situation are also good, with revenue exceeding expenditure.

All of this is a new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

All of this is the brilliant achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

All of this is a great encouragement to all the revolutionary people of China and the world!

All of this is a heavy blow to the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries! These evil elements have maliciously fabricated rumors, claiming that China's Cultural Revolution "will definitely suffer economically" and that industrial and agricultural production "will be paralyzed," and so on. However, the Chinese working people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have thoroughly shattered these evil elements' wild fantasies and fabrications with their creative and brilliant labor achievements.

The all-around leap forward in China's material front is driven by the great leap forward on the ideological front; tremendous material force is transformed from great spiritual force.

This great spiritual force is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, wrote in a letter this March about the industrial and transportation front's active study and application of Chairman Mao's works: "We must, through the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, infuse Mao Zedong Thought into the workers and peasants, so as to change the spiritual outlook of the working people and transform spiritual force into tremendous material force."

This year, the hundreds of millions of laborers on China's economic front have actively responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call, launching an unprecedented movement of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, especially the active study and application of the "Three Articles." They have elevated the movement of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, thus pushing the revolutionization of people's thoughts and the cause of production and construction to a new level.

On the agricultural front, hundreds of millions of peasants, through their eager study and application of the "Three Articles," have established the idea of farming for the collective and for the revolution, and have cultivated the revolutionary spirit and ambition of "moving mountains like Yu Gong." Taking the people of Dazhai as an example, they fear neither heaven nor earth, are not afraid of hardship or difficulty, strive hard, rely on self-reliance, and with great heroism, rely on the people's communes, which are increasingly consolidated and developed under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, to launch a magnificent struggle to transform nature. On the one hand, they have carried out unprecedented large-scale agricultural basic construction, on the other hand, they have creatively reformed production technology and cultivation systems, and at the same time, they have accelerated the development of agricultural mechanization, thus bringing about a great and profound change in the entire agricultural landscape, thereby achieving an all-around bumper harvest.

On the industrial front, revolutionary workers across the country, taking the "Three Articles" as their weapon, have carried out a thorough revolution in their souls, breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public," and establishing the worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people, thus greatly inspiring the revolutionary spirit and producing tremendous material force. They have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's series of wise decisions, taking the daring and revolutionary Daqing people as an example, daring to tread paths that others have not trodden and daring to scale peaks that others have not scaled, thus pushing China's entire industrial production technology to a new level. An independent and relatively complete modern industrial system has initially taken shape in China. The oil needed for China's national economy and national defense has been completely self-sufficient in both quantity and variety. The steel needed for China to manufacture automobiles, tractors, precision instruments and meters, petrochemicals, aircraft, atomic energy, and other industries has also been self-sufficient. During the Third Five-Year Plan period, the complete sets of equipment needed to build large-scale steel and iron combined enterprises, coal mines, oil fields, refineries, chemical plants, cement plants, power plants, aircraft factories, tractor factories, and various machinery factories will all be self-manufactured.

Now, the hundreds of millions of laborers in China are full of boundless confidence in victory as they welcome 1967. They are determined, in the new year, to raise the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works extensively and deeply, to establish Mao Zedong Thought, to better implement Chairman Mao's great call to seize the revolution and promote production, to sweep away all obstacles on the road ahead, to push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to new heights, to use the new heights of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to promote the new heights of production and construction, and to ensure victory on both the ideological and material fronts. They are determined, in the new year, to better continue to implement Chairman Mao's series of wise decisions, to turn every industry into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought, to quickly, efficiently, and economically implement the Third Five-Year Plan, and to build China into an iron fortress of the proletariat, making even greater contributions.

    伟大的毛泽东思想被广大群众所掌握就会产生巨大的物质力量
    无产阶级文化大革命带动了我国国民经济全面新跃进
    第三个五年计划第一年的任务已经全部提前超额完成
    这是对全中国和全世界革命人民的巨大鼓舞，是对帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的沉重打击
    新华社三十日讯　我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，极大地振奋和激发了我国经济战线广大职工和人民公社社员的革命精神，从而给我国整个国民经济带来了更新的面貌，更新的繁荣，带来了全面新跃进。
    我国发展国民经济的第三个五年计划第一年的任务，已经全部提前超额完成了。
    农业征服了相当严重的自然灾害，夺取了全面大丰收。粮食和棉花的收成，是解放十七年以来最好的一年；各种经济作物，以及林业和畜牧业，都是丰产的大好局面，产量都大幅度超过了去年。
    工业全面增产。钢铁、机械、煤炭、石油、电力、化学、建筑材料、木材采伐等工业，以及纺织和轻工业，都提前超额完成了既定的增产计划。品种大量增加，质量普遍提高。全国工业产值比去年增长百分之二十以上。
    工农业基本建设任务完成得很好。已经完成的投资额和工程项目，都大大超过了去年。许多重要工程的建设工期比过去缩短一半左右，工程质量也大大提高。
    交通运输战线今年承担了运送数千万革命师生进行大串连的任务，总货运量仍然超额完成了国家计划。
    科学技术有了飞跃发展。今年接连三次核试验的成功，合成苯的试验成功，人工合成结晶胰岛素的制成，以及大庆油田独创的整套采油、炼油新技术的出现，标志着我国科学技术开始进入了六十年代先进水平。
    在农业全面丰收、工业全面增产的大好形势下，全国市场购销两旺，商品收购量和销售量都比去年大幅度增长。
    我国进出口贸易情况和国家财政收支情况也很好，财政的收入大于支出。
    所有这一切，都是毛泽东思想的新的伟大胜利！
    所有这一切，都是无产阶级文化大革命的光辉成果！
    所有这一切，都是对全中国和全世界革命人民的巨大的鼓舞！
    所有这一切，都是对帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派这些坏家伙们的沉重打击。这些坏家伙们，妄想并且竭尽造谣能事，说什么我国文化大革命“肯定会在经济上遭殃”，说什么工农业生产“陷入瘫痪”，等等。然而用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国劳动人民，以创造性的光辉的劳动成果，彻底地粉碎了这些反动家伙们的妄想和造谣。
    我国物质战线上的全面跃进，是由精神战线上的大跃进带动起来的；巨大的物质力量，是由伟大的精神力量转化而成的。
    这伟大的精神力量，就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志，今年三月就工业交通战线活学活用毛主席著作写的一封信中说：“必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”
    今年，我国经济战线上的亿万劳动人民，积极响应林彪同志的号召，展开了空前未有的活学活用毛主席著作、特别是活学活用“老三篇”的群众运动，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个崭新的阶段，从而把人的思想革命化和生产建设事业，也推进到了一个崭新的阶段。
    在农业战线上，亿万农民通过如饥似渴地活学活用“老三篇”，建立了为集体种田、为革命种田的思想，树立了“愚公移山”的革命精神和雄心壮志，以大寨人为榜样，天不怕，地不怕，不怕苦、不怕难，艰苦奋斗，自力更生，以大无畏的英雄气概，依靠在毛泽东思想指引下日益巩固和发展的人民公社，展开了轰轰烈烈的改造大自然的伟大斗争。他们一方面进行了规模空前宏大的农田基本建设，一方面创造性地改革生产技术和耕作制度，同时加快发展农业机械化事业，从而使整个农田面貌发生了巨大的深刻的变化，因而赢得了农业全面大丰收。
    在工业战线上，全国广大革命职工以“老三篇”为武器，在灵魂深处大闹革命，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，大立全心全意为人民服务的世界观，从而极大地振奋了革命精神，产生了巨大的物质力量。他们坚决贯彻执行毛主席制定的一系列的英明决策，以敢于革命和善于革命的大庆人为榜样，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰，因而把我国整个工业生产技术又推向了一个崭新的水平。一个独立自主的、部门比较齐全的、现代化的工业体系，已经在我国初步形成了。我国国民经济和国防所需要的石油，在数量和品种上已经完全自给了。我国制造汽车、拖拉机、精密仪器仪表、石油化学、飞机、原子能等工业所需要的钢材，也已经可以自给了。我们第三个五年计划期间建设大型钢铁联合企业、煤矿、油田、炼油厂、化工厂、水泥厂、发电厂、飞机厂、拖拉机厂，以及各种机械工厂所需要的成套设备，将都可以自行制造了。
    现在，我国亿万劳动人民正满怀着无限的胜利信心，迎接一九六七年。他们决心在新的一年里，更高地举起战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大学大用毛主席著作，大立毛泽东思想，更好地贯彻执行毛主席提出的抓革命促生产的伟大号召，扫除一切前进道路上的绊脚石，把无产阶级文化大革命推向新的高潮，用无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮，推动生产建设的新高潮，保证在精神和物质两条战线上，夺取更大的胜利。他们决心在新的一年里，更好地继续贯彻执行毛主席亲自制定的一系列的英明决策，为把各行各业办成毛泽东思想的大学校，为多快好省地实现第三个五年计划，为把我国建设成为无产阶级的铁打的江山作出更多更大的贡献。
