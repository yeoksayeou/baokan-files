Workers at Anshan Steel, China's largest steel enterprise, have drawn endless wisdom and strength from studying Chairman Mao's works. They have transformed their spiritual outlook and turned Mao Zedong Thought into a great material force, pushing steel production to new heights.

By December 3, Anshan Steel had completed this year's state plan for steel products, steel ingots, and pig iron ahead of schedule and over quota. Significant achievements have been made in improving steel quality, developing new steel varieties, and reducing production costs. The number of newly developed products has nearly doubled, and the production of ordinary low-alloy steel has increased fivefold, realizing an all-around leap in production. At the same time, equipment conditions are better than ever. This year, a large number of new technologies, processes, new equipment, and new materials have been created. The technical and economic indicators for iron smelting and steelmaking have reached world-class levels.

Recently, workers from many factories and mines at Anshan Steel enthusiastically shared their experiences with reporters on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to promote production during the revolution. They unanimously pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought is the only correct guideline for China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the source of victory for all our undertakings. When people listen to Chairman Mao, machines listen to people. As long as we truly study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and act according to Mao Zedong Thought, we will be invincible.

Zhang Decheng, the foreman of the No. 6 open-hearth furnace at the First Steel Plant, said: The fundamental principle is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Our experience is that the more intense and difficult the production, the more we must insist on studying Chairman Mao's works and using Mao Zedong Thought to boost morale and increase enthusiasm.

Previously, there was a wrong idea that said, "Study less when busy, study more when idle." We steel workers firmly oppose this. No matter how big the sky and earth are, they cannot compare to the power of Chairman Mao's works. The more we study, the more we understand the purpose of steelmaking for the revolution. When we are busy, we are at a critical moment, and this is when we need to draw confidence and strength from Chairman Mao's works. This year, our workers, during the hot summer months known as the "difficult season" for steelmaking, studied the "Three Articles" every day, transformed their worldview, and promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking. When encountering difficulties, we used the spirit of "Yugong Moving Mountains" to break through; when encountering tight schedules at sister furnaces, we used the spirit of selflessness and dedication to cooperate actively; when encountering selfish thoughts, we fought against them with the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. As a result, new production records appeared one after another, breaking the pattern of production decline in the third quarter of previous years and achieving outstanding continuous high-yield results.

Wang Runxuan, the foreman of the No. 9 blast furnace at the Iron Plant, said: As long as Mao Zedong Thought is imprinted in our minds, dissolved in our blood, and implemented in our actions, we will have boundless energy, and production will develop endlessly. At the beginning of the year, we set a production plan that was 12% higher than last year's output. At that time, this plan seemed quite high. However, due to the active study and application of the "Three Articles," the focus on transforming our worldview, and the momentum of the Cultural Revolution, our enthusiasm grew stronger. We modified the original plan three times, and from the current production situation, the third plan is also lagging behind. We deeply feel that by grasping the revolution and promoting production, as long as we grasp the revolution, production will surely rise continuously.

All other blast furnaces in the plant are also advancing without stopping, just like our furnace. The utilization coefficient of the blast furnace, coke ratio, and quality of pig iron are the three major technical indicators of blast furnace production. Last year, our plant's three indicators all reached world-class levels. This year, on this basis, the entire plant has reached a new height and achieved the world's most advanced level.

Chen Huawen, an operator at the No. 2 Thin Plate Plant, said: Our plant is a "foreign factory" with many foreign frameworks. Although we have broken through for a few years, looking back, the breakthrough was not thorough. The reason is the obstruction of bourgeois technical "authorities."

Since this year, especially with the development of the Cultural Revolution, we workers have, through studying Chairman Mao's works, deeply realized that only Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest authority. Mao Zedong Thought is a truth that applies everywhere. With Mao Zedong Thought, we have clear minds and eyes and dare to fight resolutely against bourgeois technical "authorities." The bourgeois "authorities" do not allow us to make a revolution, but we insist on making a revolution. For example, in the past, rolling thin steel plates required two firings as per the foreign framework. We have long felt this was unreasonable. However, we could only make small changes with small effects. This year, we studied "On Practice" and realized that practice produces wisdom and science. After many experiments, we achieved the revolutionary "one-fire completion," and the production of thin steel plates leaped by 30%. This truly made the bourgeois "authorities" furious!

Our experience this year is: the more thorough the breakdown, the more solid the establishment!

Cheng Tingshuang, the group leader of the Precision Tube Manufacturing Group at the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, emphasized how, in the process of developing new products, we followed Chairman Mao's instructions to use the power of the masses. He said: Our plant's new product development tasks have increased by 54% compared to the beginning of the year, and most of them are high-level and cutting-edge products. However, because we drew wisdom and strength from Chairman Mao's works, the new product development tasks were completed well, and most of them achieved success in one trial and one production.

Currently, the broad revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel are using Mao Zedong Thought to summarize this year's production, focusing on preparing for next year's production, so as to better complete this year's tasks while creating conditions for next year's production, striving for even greater achievements next year.

    鞍钢提前超额完成钢铁生产年计划
    在提高钢材质量、发展钢材品种和降低成本方面取得优异成绩，新产品增加近一倍，普通低合金钢产量增加五倍，实现了生产全面跃进。
    据新华社沈阳电　在第三个五年计划的第一年，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我国最大的钢铁企业——鞍山钢铁公司的广大革命职工，从活学活用毛主席著作中汲取了无穷的智慧，改变了自己的精神面貌，使毛泽东思想这个伟大的精神力量，变成伟大的物质力量，从而把钢铁生产又推进到一个新的高度。
    到十二月三日为止，鞍钢已经提前超额完成了今年的钢材、钢锭和生铁的国家计划。在提高钢材质量、发展钢材品种和降低生产成本方面都取得了优异的成绩，试制成功的新产品猛增了近一倍，普通低合金钢的产量增加了五倍，实现了生产的全面跃进。与此同时，设备状况空前良好。在这一年里，还创制了大批的新技术、新工艺、新设备和新材料。炼铁、炼钢的绝大部分技术经济指标，达到了世界先进的水平。
    最近，鞍钢许多厂矿职工兴致勃勃地向记者畅谈了今年活学活用毛主席著作，抓革命促生产的体会。他们一致指出：毛泽东思想是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设唯一正确的指导方针，是我们一切事业胜利的源泉。人听毛主席的话，机器就听人的话。只要我们真正学好用好毛泽东思想，按照毛泽东思想办事，我们就无往而不胜。
    第一炼钢厂六号平炉炉长张德成说：千条万条，活学活用毛主席著作是根本的一条。我们的体会是，生产越紧张越困难，越要坚持学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想鼓勇气，增干劲。
    以前，有种歪道理，说什么“忙时少学，闲时多学。”我们炼钢工人坚决反对。天大地大，比不上毛主席著作威力大。大伙越学习越明确为革命炼钢的道理。忙时正处在紧要关头，这就更需要从毛主席著作中提高信心，增加力量。今年我厂工人在冶炼工人称为“难关季节”的大热天里，天天大学“老三篇”，改造世界观，促进人的思想革命化。大家遇到困难，就用“愚公移山”精神去突破；遇到兄弟炉活计紧张，就用毫不利己专门利人的精神，去主动协作；遇到私心杂念，就用“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的精神去斗争。结果，生产新纪录接连出现，打破了历年三季度生产下降的局面，获得了持续高产的优异成绩。
    炼铁厂九号高炉炉长王润萱说：只要把毛泽东思想印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上，浑身就有使不完的劲头，生产就会无止境地向前发展。年初，大伙商订了一个比去年产量高百分之十二的生产计划，当时看来，这个计划还是比较高的。但是，由于大伙活学活用“老三篇”，狠抓世界观的改造，在文化大革命运动的推动下，劲头越来越大，连续三次修改了原计划，从目前生产形势看，第三次的计划又落后了。我们深深地体会到：抓革命促生产，只要狠抓革命，生产必然不断上升。
    全厂其它高炉也同我们炉子一样，不停地前进。高炉的利用系数、焦比和生铁质量是高炉生产技术的三大指标。去年，我厂这三项指标都进入世界水平。今年，在这个基础上全厂又登上一个新高度，达到了世界最先进的水平。
    第二薄板厂轧板机操纵工陈华文说：我们厂是“洋厂子”，洋框框很多。过去虽然破了几年，但是回头来看，破得很不彻底。原因就是资产阶级技术“权威”的阻挠。
    今年以来，特别是无产阶级文化大革命运动开展以来，我们工人通过大学毛主席著作，深刻地认识到，只有毛泽东思想是最大的权威。毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的真理。有了毛泽东思想，我们就心明眼亮，敢于同资产阶级技术“权威”进行坚决的斗争。资产阶级“权威”老爷不准我们革命，我们偏要革命。比如，过去轧薄钢板，洋框框规定一定要烧两次。老早我们就感到不合理。但是，只能小改小革，效果比针尖还小。今年我们学习了《实践论》，认识到实践出智慧，实践出科学。大家经过许许多多次的试验，实现了“一次烧成”的革命，薄钢板产量一下子跃进了百分之三十。这真是活活气死资产阶级“权威”！
    我们今年的体会是：破得越彻底，立得越牢靠！
    无缝钢管厂精密造管组组长程廷双着重谈了在试制新产品的工作中，如何遵照毛主席的指示，把群众的力量用在点子上的问题。他说：我们厂承担的新产品试制任务，比年初计划猛增了百分之五十四，大部分是属于高级和尖端的产品。但是，由于我们从毛主席著作中汲取了智慧和力量，试制新产品的任务完成得很好，绝大部分实现了一次试验成功，一次投产。
    目前，鞍钢广大革命职工正在运用毛泽东思想总结今年生产，狠抓明年的生产准备工作，以便在更好地完成今年任务的同时，为明年生产创造条件，争取明年取得更大成绩。（附图片）
