Mao Zedong's work "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War" has been translated into Lao by the Political Department of the Xieng Khouang Region Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army and is being used for study by the troops.

The Lao People's Liberation Army attaches great importance to the study of Mao Zedong's theories on people's war. General Singkap recently said, "We regard Mao Zedong's works as textbooks because they embody the spirit of people's war in both political and military aspects."

The Political Department of the Xieng Khouang Region Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army often translates Mao Zedong's works into Lao and distributes them among the troops to help them study.

The "Liberation Army News" published in Khamkeut also frequently prints quotations from Chairman Mao, so that the troops can study Chairman Mao's quotations while reading the newspaper. Before many units of the Liberation Army conduct battle summaries, they always study Chairman Mao's works.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the Lao People's Liberation Army have concluded from their personal experience that Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical principles of people's war are the most powerful ideological weapons for the people who are waging armed struggle. The leaders of the Xieng Khouang Region Command once told Chinese reporters: "Chairman Mao's military works are very relevant to our current revolutionary struggle in Laos. Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts on people's war have greatly boosted our confidence in defeating American imperialism."

    鼓舞信心　指导战斗
    毛主席的著作《中国革命战争的战略问题》，已经由老挝解放军川圹地区指挥部政治部译成老挝文，供指战员学习。
    老挝解放军对学习毛主席的人民战争理论非常重视。辛加坡将军不久前说：“我们把毛泽东的著作当作教材，因为他的著作在政治和军事方面体现了人民战争的精神。”
    老挝解放军川圹地区指挥部政治部为了帮助指战员们学习毛主席著作，经常把毛主席著作译成老挝文，在部队印发。
    在康开出版的《解放军报》也经常刊登毛主席语录，好让指战员们阅读报纸时，学习毛主席的语录。解放军的许多部队在进行战斗总结前，也都一定学习毛主席的著作。
    老挝解放军的广大指战员从亲身体验中得出结论：毛主席关于人民战争的战略战术，对于正在进行武装斗争的人民来说，是最强大的思想武器。老挝川圹地区指挥部的领导人就曾对中国记者说：毛主席的军事著作“对我们当前老挝革命斗争是很有现实意义的。毛泽东主席的人民战争思想，大大鼓舞了我们战胜美帝国主义的信心。”
