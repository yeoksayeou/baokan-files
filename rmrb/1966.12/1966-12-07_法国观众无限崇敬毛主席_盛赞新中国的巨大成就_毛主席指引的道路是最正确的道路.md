During the exhibition period, the Chinese Pavilion at the Second Paris International Food Exhibition received over 60,000 visitors. Many visitors expressed their deep admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao and praised the tremendous achievements of the Chinese people under Chairman Mao's wise leadership.

Two elderly Frenchmen, after visiting the Chinese Pavilion, excitedly told the Chinese staff, "We congratulate you on your great achievements. The path guided by Chairman Mao is the most correct path. The Cultural Revolution is excellent. You are the true Marxists." Another visitor compared the Soviet Pavilion with the Chinese Pavilion. He said, "The Soviet Union has become 'capitalist,' there is nothing good in their exhibition hall; yours is a radiant exhibition hall." He pointed at the portrait of Chairman Mao and said to the Chinese staff, "Our hope lies with Chairman Mao, it lies with you."

An elderly overseas Chinese worker wrote in the guestbook, "China is great, China's path is correct. Chairman Mao is always with the people, Chairman Mao is great, long live Chairman Mao!"

An Algerian worker visited the Chinese Pavilion every day to pay his respects to the portrait of Chairman Mao at the entrance. He also said that many of his Algerian colleagues hoped to obtain a Chairman Mao badge. A French friend also asked the Chinese staff for a Chairman Mao badge with the words "Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Years!" on the back. He couldn't help but say, "'Long Live Chairman Mao!' This is your wish, and it is also our wish. You have expressed all your feelings for Chairman Mao in this sentence."

Many visitors also expressed their unlimited admiration for Chairman Mao. One day, three French young students came to the Chinese Pavilion. As soon as they entered, they respectfully bowed to the portrait of Chairman Mao. Another day, an elderly man brought his child to the Chinese Pavilion. Seeing the quotations from Chairman Mao on the wall, he read them carefully and said to his child, "Chairman Mao's words are good!" When he turned around and saw the portrait of Chairman Mao, he immediately took off his hat and paid his respects.

A French couple told the Chinese staff that many French people love Chairman Mao. They raised their arms and shouted, "Long Live Chairman Mao!"

Many visitors came to the Chinese Pavilion eagerly hoping to obtain Chairman Mao's works. Some friends who came specifically to find Chairman Mao's works said, "We have been looking everywhere for Chairman Mao's books, and now we have found them!"

Many visitors expressed their deep affection for the Chinese people led by Chairman Mao.

They wrote in the guestbook: "Salute to the great People's Republic of China and the Chinese people," "Heartfelt admiration for the Chinese people," "Seeing China's progress makes me especially happy," "To the people of your noble country who oppose imperialism, we pay our highest respect!" "We are heart to heart with you," "Long Live the People's China!" An elderly French couple also told the Chinese staff, "China is great! We do not believe the rumors in Western newspapers. We believe you. We are workers, and we have a common language with you."

    法国观众无限崇敬毛主席　盛赞新中国的巨大成就
    毛主席指引的道路是最正确的道路
    新华社巴黎电　第二届巴黎国际食品展览会中国馆在展出期间，共接待了六万多观众。许多观众热情表示对伟大的领袖毛主席的崇敬，并赞扬中国人民在毛主席的英明领导下所取得的巨大成就。
    两个法国老人在参观中国馆后，激动地对中国工作人员说：“我们祝贺你们取得的伟大成就。毛主席指引的道路是最正确的道路。文化大革命非常好。你们是真正的马克思主义者。”另一个参观者把苏联馆和中国馆作了对比。他说，苏联已经“资本主义化了，展览馆里没有什么好东西；而你们的才是一个光芒四射的展览馆”。他指着毛主席像对中国工作人员说：“希望就寄托在毛主席身上，就寄托在你们身上。”
    一个老华侨工人在留言簿上写道：“中国好，中国的路走得对。毛主席永远在群众中，毛主席好，毛主席万岁！”
    有一个阿尔及利亚工人每天都到中国馆来瞻仰展览馆进口处矗立的毛主席像。他还说，同他一起工作的许多阿尔及利亚人都希望得到一枚毛主席像章。一位法国朋友也向中国工作人员索要一枚背面刻有“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”字样的毛主席像章。他情不自禁地说：“‘毛主席万岁！’这是你们的祝愿，也是我们的祝愿。你们把对毛主席的全部感情都集中在这一句话上表达出来了。”
    不少观众还表达了他们对毛主席的无限崇敬。有一天，三个法国青年学生来中国馆参观，一进门，就恭恭敬敬地向毛主席像鞠躬。另一天，一个老人领着他的孩子来中国馆参观时，看到了墙上的毛主席语录，就认真地读起来，并且对他的孩子说：“毛主席说得好啊！”当他转身看到了毛主席像时，马上把帽子摘下来，向毛主席致敬。
    有一对法国夫妇对中国人员说，很多法国人热爱毛主席。他们振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    很多观众怀着迫切的心情来中国馆希望得到毛主席著作。一些专程来中国馆找毛主席著作的朋友们说：“我们到处找毛主席的书，这下可找到了！”
    许多观众都对毛主席领导的中国人民表示深厚的情谊。
    他们在留言簿上写道：“向伟大的中华人民共和国和中国人民致敬”，“衷心钦佩中国人民”，“看到中国进步我感到特别高兴”，“向反对帝国主义的贵国人民致以崇高的敬意！”“我们同你们心连心”，“人民中国万岁！”一对年老的法国夫妇还对中国人员说：“中国好！我们不相信西方报纸所造的谣言。我们相信你们。我们是工人，同你们有共同的语言。”
