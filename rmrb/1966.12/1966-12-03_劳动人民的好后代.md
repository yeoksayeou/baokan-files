Seventy-five Red Guards from Chouhe Middle School in Qichun County, Hubei, arrived in Xunshui on October 31. They had marched 100 li that day and were all very tired, with blisters on their feet. However, as soon as they put down their backpacks, they immediately started studying Chairman Mao's quotations and rushed to do good deeds. They cleaned all the rooms in the reception hall thoroughly, helped the service staff carry meals, wash dishes, and wipe tables and chairs. When comrades asked them to rest, they said, "We are not tired. We want to learn from the People's Liberation Army."

The next day, after breakfast, they took their "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and sang revolutionary songs as they went to the countryside. Upon arriving at the October Brigade, they visited the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants to learn about their hardships. They also visited the active members of the brigade who study Chairman Mao's works and asked them to share their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works. They labored with the commune members and did many good deeds for the poor and lower-middle peasants. The commune members were deeply moved and praised them as good descendants of the working people and good Red Guards of Chairman Mao.

The poor and lower-middle peasants love the Red Guards and welcome the revolutionary youngsters on their Long March. This is a scene of a Long March team from Beijing being warmly welcomed by the commune members on their way.

    劳动人民的好后代
    湖北蕲春漕河中学七十五个长征红卫兵，在十月三十一日来到了浠水。他们这天经过一百里急行军，都很累了，脚上起了血泡。可是，他们一放下背包，就抓紧学习毛主席语录，抢着做好事。他们把招待所的全部房间打扫得干干净净，帮助服务员拿饭菜，洗碗筷，擦桌椅。同志们叫他们休息，他们说：“我们不累，我们要向解放军学习。”
    第二天吃过早饭，他们带着《毛主席语录》，唱着革命歌曲，走到农村去。他们一到十月大队，就到贫下中农家访贫问苦；还访问了十月大队的学习毛主席著作积极分子，请他给队员们讲学习毛主席著作的经验。他们和社员一起劳动，为贫下中农做了不少好事。社员受到很大感动，都赞扬他们是劳动人民的好后代，是毛主席的好红卫兵。

    贫下中农热爱红卫兵，欢迎长征的革命小将。这是北京的一支长征队的革命小将，在途中受到社员群众热烈欢迎的情形。
