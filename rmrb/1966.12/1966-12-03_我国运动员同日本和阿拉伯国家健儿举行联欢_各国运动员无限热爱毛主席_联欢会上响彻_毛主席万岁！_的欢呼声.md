Chinese and Japanese athletes participating in the First Asian New Forces Games gathered in the "Sports City" in Phnom Penh on the afternoon of the 30th to celebrate the deep friendship between the peoples of China and Japan and the successful opening of the Asian New Forces Games.

Deputy Secretary-General Guo Lei of the Chinese Sports Delegation and team leader Cheng Mao Yinshen of the Japanese Judo team both spoke at the gathering.

The gathering was filled with joy and friendship from beginning to end. Japanese athletes expressed their admiration for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong. They eagerly sought Mao Zedong badges, portraits of Mao Zedong, and the Japanese version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" from the Chinese athletes. When a Japanese athlete received a Mao Zedong badge, he enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Another Japanese athlete, after receiving a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," excitedly said, "This is the most precious book." He immediately sang a song praising Chairman Mao, "The Ship Sails on the Sea," in Chinese, which was warmly received by the entire audience. Another Japanese athlete asked a Chinese friend for a color portrait of Chairman Mao reviewing the Red Guards on Tiananmen Gate. He was overjoyed and immediately wrote a note to the Chinese friend in Chinese: "I love Mao Zedong!"

The athletes of the two countries exchanged friendly sentiments, with laughter and singing echoing throughout. The athletes of the two countries, with excited hearts, took turns walking to the center of the hall, singing songs from China and Japan. The Japanese female athletes also sang "The Waves of Honghu Lake" in Chinese with the Chinese female athletes, which was warmly received.

According to Xinhua News Agency, on the afternoon of the 1st, the Chinese Sports Delegation held a grand friendship gathering with friends from Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon in the "Sports City" in Phnom Penh.

This was a warm and friendly gathering filled with the fighting friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of the Arab countries. The Arab friends expressed their boundless love for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao.

Deputy Leader Zhao Zhengong of the Chinese Sports Delegation spoke at the beginning of the gathering. The leader of the Palestinian Sports Delegation and a responsible person from the Lebanese Sports Delegation also spoke. The leader of the Palestinian Sports Delegation ended his speech with a shout: "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!"

During their speeches, the Arab friends repeatedly led the Chinese friends in shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the unity of the Chinese and Arab peoples against imperialism!" "Down with American imperialism!"

At the gathering, Arab sports friends enthusiastically expressed their high respect and boundless love for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. They eagerly sought portraits of Mao, works of Mao, and Mao badges from the Chinese friends. Their wishes were fulfilled, and they were all overjoyed. A Palestinian friend said, "Chairman Mao Zedong is a great revolutionary teacher. His works give the fighting Palestinian people an invaluable force. All Palestinians respect Mao Zedong and love the Chinese people." An Iraqi athlete pointed to the Mao badge on his chest and said, "Chairman Mao Zedong is a great revolutionary leader." A Syrian athlete asked Chinese gymnast Wang Weijian how she won the championship in four gymnastics events. Wang Weijian took out her "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and said that she achieved victory by relying on Mao Zedong Thought. She also opened "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and pointed out the sentence, "With firm determination, we shall not be afraid of sacrifice, we shall overcome all difficulties, and we shall win victory." The Syrian friend, after hearing this, immediately opened his newly acquired English version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read this passage. At the gathering, Chinese athletes sang songs praising Chairman Mao, and Palestinian referee Ismail Harabi sang "The East Is Red" in Chinese.

When the gathering ended, the Arab friends from various countries again led the way in shouting in Chinese: "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!"

On the afternoon of December 1, Chinese athletes and athletes from various Arab countries held a gathering. At the gathering, a Palestinian boxing referee held up a portrait of Chairman Mao and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"
