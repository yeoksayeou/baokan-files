The Macau Daily has recently published a series of readers' articles and a large number of readers' letters, exposing the serious crimes of the Portuguese authorities in harboring and protecting American and Chiang Kai-shek agents. The articles and letters sternly warn the Portuguese authorities that they must immediately and thoroughly implement the four conditions proposed by the Director of the Guangdong Provincial Foreign Affairs Office and all the just demands of the people of Macau.

The readers' articles published in the Macau Daily reveal that over the past seventeen years, the Portuguese authorities have allowed and protected the reactionary forces of America and Chiang Kai-shek to use Macau as a base to store weapons, train agents, and commit countless atrocities against the Chinese people and the people of Macau. The articles expose that from 1950 to 1958, over a period of nine years, American and Chiang Kai-shek agents alone took the lives of 26 Macau residents. They also caused more than 20 people to go missing, injured over 200, destroyed more than 40 houses, left over 300 people homeless, and subjected countless young people, students, workers, and other residents to threats, extortion, and other forms of persecution, seriously disrupting social stability.

Many collective letters from workers point out that the Portuguese authorities are colluding with American and Chiang Kai-shek agents, acting in cahoots. This situation cannot be allowed to continue. The Portuguese authorities must drive out these harmful elements completely from Macau, and all American and Chiang Kai-shek agent organizations must be completely shut down. The letters state: "We must shout at you, the American and Chiang Kai-shek agents must be cleared out, and we will not rest until they are."

Many readers' letters sternly point out that the four conditions proposed in the statement by the Director of the Guangdong Provincial Foreign Affairs Office are the demands of the people of Macau. The statement clearly states that the Portuguese authorities must 'guarantee that Chiang Kai-shek agents will not be allowed to engage in any activities in Macau in the future,' fully expressing the ardent wishes of all patriotic people in Macau. The Portuguese authorities must implement this thoroughly without any discount.

    揭露澳葡当局包庇美蒋特务的罪行
    新华社香港二十四日电　《澳门日报》最近连续发表读者写的文章和一大批读者来信，揭露澳葡当局纵容和包庇美蒋特务的严重罪行，严正警告澳葡当局必须立即全部彻底实现广东省外事处长提出的四项条件和澳门同胞提出的一切正义要求。
    《澳门日报》发表的读者文章揭露，澳葡当局十七年来纵容、包庇美蒋反动派以澳门为基地储藏军火，训练美蒋特务，对中国人民和澳门同胞做尽了坏事。文章揭露，从一九五○年到一九五八年的九年中，据不完全的统计，美蒋特务就欠下了澳门同胞二十六条人命血债。他们还使得二十多人失踪，二百多人受伤，毁屋四十多间，三百多人无家可归，无数青年、学生、工人和其他居民受到恐吓、勒索和其他迫害，社会安宁受到严重的破坏。
    许多工人的集体来信指出，澳葡当局同美蒋特务相勾结，狼狈为奸，这种局面绝不能继续存在，澳葡当局必须把这些害人虫完全扫出澳门，所有美蒋特务机构必须完全查封。来信说：“我们要向你们大喝一声，美蒋特务一天不肃清，我们一天不罢休。”
    许多读者来信严正指出，广东省外事处长声明中提出的四项条件就是澳门同胞的要求，上面明文写着的澳葡当局必须“切实保证今后决不允许蒋匪特务在澳门进行任何活动”，充分表达了全澳爱国同胞的热切愿望，澳葡当局必须彻底照办，不许打半点折扣。
