The year 1966 is coming to an end. The great proletarian cultural revolution, initiated by Chairman Mao, is advancing with irresistible momentum. The broad masses of revolutionary people are enthusiastically smashing the "four olds" and establishing the "four news." The old world is being swept away, and a new world is emerging.

In this great revolution, the revolutionary masses have shown unprecedented courage and creativity. They have fearlessly exposed and criticized the reactionary bourgeoisie's academic "authorities" and their poisonous influence. They have boldly challenged and overthrown the reactionary bourgeoisie's authority in the realm of ideology. They have smashed the shackles of feudalism and capitalism, liberating their minds and thoughts. They have established a new proletarian ideology, a new proletarian culture, and a new proletarian art.

The revolutionary masses have also shown great wisdom and initiative in their struggle. They have creatively applied Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought to their practical work, achieving remarkable results. They have formed revolutionary committees in many places, taking over the leadership of production and other work from the reactionary bourgeoisie. They have established revolutionary order and discipline, ensuring the smooth progress of the revolution and production.

The year 1966 has been a year of great upheaval and change. It has been a year of great struggle and victory. The revolutionary masses have made great sacrifices and achievements. They have written a glorious chapter in the history of the great proletarian cultural revolution.

As we bid farewell to the old year and welcome the new year, we must remember the great achievements of the past year. We must learn from the revolutionary masses' courage, creativity, wisdom, and initiative. We must continue to smash the "four olds" and establish the "four news." We must continue to struggle against the reactionary bourgeoisie and their influence. We must continue to advance the great proletarian cultural revolution, building a new socialist China.

Long live Chairman Mao!
Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution!
Long live the victory of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!
