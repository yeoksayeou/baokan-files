Firmly adhere to studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the seven "excellent workers" of Shanghai Factory 101 recently held a discussion to share their experiences in studying the "Three Articles" to transform their worldview. They said: The "Three Articles" are powerful ideological weapons for transforming people's souls and are compulsory courses for cultivating communist new people. Selflessness and dedication to the public good are the core of the proletarian worldview, and eliminating the bourgeoisie and establishing the proletariat is the focal point of class struggle in the mind. Only by thoroughly understanding the "Three Articles" can one truly grasp Chairman Mao's other works; without mastering the ideology of the "Three Articles," it is impossible to truly grasp Mao Zedong Thought.

There are no born revolutionaries in the world; the working class must also transform their thoughts

At the beginning of the discussion, several excellent workers first talked about a common experience: Only by seriously and diligently studying the "Three Articles" can one continuously improve the self-awareness of ideological transformation; the more proactive one is in ideological transformation, the more one can understand, remember, and apply the "Three Articles."

Excellent worker and quality inspector of the Product Quality Inspection Department, Luo Xiangsheng, said: I was born into a poor peasant family, worked from a young age, and suffered endless exploitation and oppression. After liberation, I stood up, joined the party, and have unlimited love for the party and Chairman Mao, and for the new society. I thought: I am a born revolutionary proletarian, not a landlord or capitalist, so what do I need to transform? Later, reading Chairman Mao's teachings: "In the process of building a socialist society, everyone needs to be transformed, the exploiters need to be transformed, and the laborers also need to be transformed. Who says the working class does not need to be transformed? Of course, the transformation of the exploiters and the laborers are two different types of transformations and cannot be confused." Studying the "Three Articles" and connecting them with my own thoughts, the more I thought about it, the more I felt that Chairman Mao was criticizing me. In the past, I only focused on work and eating, and when encountering things, I calculated personal interests, wasn't this the bourgeoisie ideology playing tricks in my mind? We workers, if we do not seriously study Chairman Mao's works and use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our own thoughts, we will not become proletarian revolutionary fighters.

Excellent worker and 17-year-old Chen Mukui said: Old workers need to transform their thoughts, and young workers even more so; we need to take over the proletarian cause, and first, we need to take over the proletarian ideology. In the past, I thought I had a good background, my father was a worker, and I grew up in the sunlight of socialism wearing a red scarf, not only was I "naturally red," but I was also "double-insured," and I was sure I was a proletarian successor. However, when put to the test in real life and compared with the "Three Articles," I overturned my own conclusion. In 1963, I was still in middle school, and my father wanted me to go to the factory to learn tailoring, but I was unwilling. After entering the factory, I saw others wearing wool pants and colorful socks, and I felt uncomfortable with my own cloth clothes. Last year, the youth league praised some young people but did not mention me, and I was unhappy. Just as Chairman Mao pointed out: "After doing a little work, one feels great and likes to boast, fearing that others do not know." I blamed the leadership for not seeing my achievements. These incidents made me gradually understand: What "naturally red" and "double-insured," it is completely self-deception. In our minds, it is either socialist ideology that occupies the territory or bourgeois ideology that occupies the territory. The offspring of workers, if they relax their ideological transformation and allow bourgeois ideology to expand in their minds, not only will they not become proletarian successors, but they will also have the danger of becoming bourgeois successors.

Excellent worker and labor organizer of the third workshop, Ye Abing, recalled and compared his different experiences in the old and new societies, saying excitedly: "A person having a good background is only a favorable condition for ideological transformation and cannot be a reason to reject ideological transformation. From my own liberation, I have developed a deep affection for the party, Chairman Mao, and socialism. This precious and simple class sentiment enables me to accept Mao Zedong Thought more quickly, but it does not mean that I have a high level of class consciousness. We workers have been liberated politically and economically, but this does not mean that the task of ideological transformation is also completed. Because first, we were cruelly exploited and oppressed in the old society, and at the same time, we were infiltrated and poisoned by the reactionary ideology of the exploiting class. Second, class struggle still exists in socialist society. If we relax our ideological transformation, we will forget our roots and change. Third, the socialist revolution is constantly deepening, and if personal interests cannot be subordinated to revolutionary interests, and one cannot consciously revolutionize, one cannot adapt to the needs of the socialist revolution and will fall behind in the revolutionary ranks. We, the working class, must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The working class must transform the entire society in class struggle and struggle against nature, and at the same time, transform itself. The working class must continuously learn in work, gradually overcome its own shortcomings, and never stop."

"The Three Articles" are powerful ideological weapons for eliminating the bourgeoisie and establishing the proletariat, transforming people's souls

Whether to serve the self or the public, whether to serve oneself or the revolution, is the fundamental opposition of the bourgeoisie and proletarian worldviews. Several excellent workers believe: Eliminating the bourgeoisie and establishing the proletariat, thoroughly overthrowing the old moral concept of "if one does not serve oneself, one will be punished by heaven and earth," and truly establishing the new moral concept of "selflessness and dedication to the public good," is the fundamental purpose of our study of the "Three Articles."

Excellent worker and female worker of the seventh workshop, Xu Meiying, said: Before studying the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's other works, my mind was full of selfish thoughts, and I did not understand for whom to work and why to work. Later, studying Chairman Mao's works, I understood that work is struggle and laboring for the revolution. Last year, the factory adjusted to produce a new product, and a relatively difficult process was difficult to allocate. I thought, Chairman Mao teaches us: When doing work, one cannot pick the light and avoid the heavy, pushing the heavy tasks to others and picking the light ones for oneself. I am a Communist Party member and should dare to take on heavy tasks, so I voluntarily accepted this difficult process. Later, when encountering difficulties in production, the quality was also not good. At this time, selfish thoughts popped up again. I studied the "Three Articles" with these problems in mind. Chairman Mao said: "Our comrades, when facing difficulties, should see achievements, see light, and raise our courage." I gathered my courage, used my spare time to practice my skills, and finally, after a struggle, improved the production and quality.

Xu Meiying said: Encountering difficulties will have selfish thoughts, and obtaining honors will also have selfish thoughts. After being rated as an excellent worker and being praised by the factory, I had the thought of "preserving honor." I brought these problems to study the "Three Articles" again, and using the mirror of "completely" and "thoroughly," and the scale of the two "extremes," the "self" in the depths of my soul had nowhere to hide. The party and comrades rated me as an excellent worker and learning model, requiring me to work harder for the revolution and better serve the people. I only wanted to "preserve honor," wasn't this putting on the burden of individualism, completely against Chairman Mao's teachings? After understanding this, my spirit came back.

Xu Meiying believes: To wholeheartedly serve the people, one must dare to fight against the "self" and dare to struggle against the "selfish." Only by overthrowing individualism can one forge a red heart for serving the people.

Excellent worker and production group leader of the second workshop, Zhu Fude, and excellent worker and production group leader of the fifth workshop, Zhang Taodi, talked about a common experience: Doing revolution must be wholeheartedly, and one cannot negotiate conditions; serving the people must be wholeheartedly, and one cannot negotiate conditions. Negotiating conditions, although everyone has different ideas, on this issue and that issue, has different manifestations, ultimately, it is still a matter of "self."

Zhu Fude said: The struggle between serving the self or the public is constantly occurring. In work, it is like this, and in life, it is even more so. A few years ago, because I was preparing to get married, I applied for housing allocation, and the leadership did not help me solve it at the time, so I felt that the leadership did not care about me, and I was not enthusiastic about work. At that time, some comrades said to me: Serving the people cannot negotiate conditions, go back and study the "Three Articles," see what Chairman Mao says. I opened the "Three Articles," studied it once, and the glorious images of Zhang Side and Norman Bethune appeared before my eyes. I studied it again, and I couldn't help but feel my heart racing and my face burning. I was far from the standard of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. I felt that in ideological transformation, eliminating the bourgeoisie and establishing the proletariat is the main direction; in eliminating the bourgeoisie and establishing the proletariat, each person still needs to select their own main target. After selecting the target of eliminating the bourgeoisie and establishing the proletariat for oneself, one can confront it head-on, aim accurately, create one's own counter-revolution, use Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the class enemy in the depths of one's soul with "bayonets," concentrate forces, and fight annihilation battles one by one, finally winning the battle of eliminating the bourgeoisie and establishing the proletariat.

Care for and help people must highlight politics and highlight Mao Zedong Thought

Chairman Mao said: "We all come from the five lakes and four seas, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together.... Everyone in the revolutionary ranks must care for each other, love each other, and help each other." Several excellent workers all believe: In the revolutionary ranks, whether comrades can care for each other, love each other, and help each other, whether they can prioritize the public over the private and others over the self, is an important link in ideological transformation, an important aspect of eliminating the bourgeoisie and establishing the proletariat, and a serious test of whether one can wholeheartedly serve the people.

Luo Xiangsheng said: This year, when the factory launched the "one helps one, one pair of reds" activity, I wanted to pair with an excellent worker, thinking "definitely a pair of reds." However, the leadership wanted me to pair with another inspector. I was not happy. I brought this problem back to study the "Three Articles." Chairman Mao clearly teaches us that "all" revolutionary ranks must help each other, why did I insist on choosing "individuals"? This is not "when facing a matter, first think of oneself"? Through this matter, I felt that mutual learning and help should first "study the 'Three Articles' together and expose active thoughts." Only by taking Mao Zedong Thought as our unified thought can we have a common language, common actions, and truly achieve the goal of mutual learning and help to form a pair of reds.

Xu Meiying, when talking about her experience of caring for and helping people with Mao Zedong Thought, said: Not only should one care for people in terms of life and production, but more importantly, one should care for and help people in terms of politics and ideology, especially using the great Mao Zedong Thought to care for and help people. Propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought to comrades, caring for their study of Chairman Mao's works, helping them to arm their minds with the thoughts of the "Three Articles," is the greatest care, greatest love, and greatest help for revolutionary comrades, and is also the most important service to the people.

Excellent worker and production group leader of the sixth workshop, Wang Peiren, is a person who actively studies and applies the "Three Articles," drawing great spiritual strength from Chairman Mao's works, overcoming the tumor demon, and recovering health. He excitedly said: Many comrades in our factory all require themselves not only to revolutionize the eight hours of work but also to revolutionize the time outside of work; not only to have red thoughts but also to have a red family. I want to add a sentence, that is: Not only should one serve the people in normal times, but one should also serve the people when sick. In the hospital and sanatorium, in addition to doing some things for everyone as much as possible, I took propagating Mao Zedong Thought to those who were treated and recuperated together, and organizing the whole family, old and young, to study Chairman Mao's works, as the most important content of my service to the people while sick. I deeply feel that in our society, everywhere is a classroom for studying Chairman Mao's works, everywhere is a battlefield for ideological transformation, and everywhere is a place for serving the people.

    认真活学活用“老三篇”打好灭资兴无思想仗
    上海一○一厂五好工人座谈改造世界观的体会
    毛主席说：“工人阶级要在阶级斗争中和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。工人阶级必须在工作中不断学习，逐步克服自己的缺点，永远也不能停止。”
    据新华社上海十日电　坚持活学活用毛主席著作的上海一○一厂的七位五好工人，最近举行座谈，交流学习“老三篇”改造世界观的体会。他们说：“老三篇”是改造人们灵魂的强大思想武器，是培养共产主义新人的必修课；毫不利己、专门利人是无产阶级世界观的核心，灭资兴无、破私立公是头脑里阶级斗争的焦点。学通了“老三篇”，才能学通毛主席著作的其他许多篇；“老三篇”的思想学不到手，就不可能把毛泽东思想真正学到手。
      世界上没有天生的革命者，工人阶级同样要改造思想
    座谈一开始，几位五好工人首先谈到一条共同的体会：只有认真地刻苦地学习“老三篇”，才能不断提高思想改造的自觉性；越是在思想改造上打主动仗，“老三篇”也就越能学得懂，记得住，用得上。
    五好工人、产品质量检验科检验工罗香生说：我出生在贫农家庭里，从小做工，受尽了剥削和压迫，解放以后翻了身，入了党，对党和毛主席无限热爱，对新社会无限热爱。我想：我是天生的革命无产阶级，又不是地主资本家，还需要改造什么？后来，读到毛主席的教导：“在建设社会主义社会的过程中，人人需要改造，剥削者要改造，劳动者也要改造，谁说工人阶级不要改造？当然，剥削者的改造和劳动者的改造是两种不同性质的改造，不能混为一谈。”再学“老三篇”，跟自己的思想挂起钩来，越想越感到毛主席好像就是在批评我一样。我过去只管做工吃饭，遇事计较个人利益，不就是剥削阶级思想在自己脑子里作怪吗？我们工人如果不好好学习毛主席著作，不用毛泽东思想来改造自己的思想，就不会成为无产阶级革命战士。
    五好工人、十七岁的陈木楷说：老工人要改造思想，青年工人更要改造思想；我们要接无产阶级的班，首先就要接无产阶级思想的班。我过去以为自己出身好，父亲是工人，自己是在社会主义阳光下戴着红领巾长大的，不但“自然红”，而且“双保险”，笃定是无产阶级接班人。可是，在实际生活中一考验，再用“老三篇”一对照，自己就把自己的结论推翻了。一九六三年，我还在中学读书，父亲要我进厂学裁缝，心里就一百个不愿意。进厂以后，偶然看到别人穿了呢裤子花袜子，就对自己身上的布衣服感到不顺眼。去年年底，团组织表扬了一些青年，没有提到我，心里就不高兴。就像毛主席指出的：“出了一点力就觉得了不起，喜欢自吹，生怕人家不知道。”埋怨领导上看不到我的成绩。这些事情使我逐步懂得：什么“自然红”“双保险”，完全是自欺欺人的。在我们的头脑里，不是社会主义思想占领阵地，就是资本主义思想占领阵地。工人的后代，如果放松思想改造，听任资产阶级思想在自己头脑里扩大阵地，不但不会成为无产阶级接班人，还有成为资产阶级接班人的危险。
    五好工人、三车间劳动组织员叶阿炳，回忆对比了自己在新旧社会的不同遭遇，激动地说：“一个人出身好，只是思想改造的一个有利条件，而决不能成为拒绝思想改造的理由。我从自己的翻身解放中，对党，对毛主席，对社会主义产生了深厚的感情，这种宝贵的朴素的阶级感情，使自己能够较快地接受毛泽东思想，但决不是说已经具有多高的阶级觉悟。我们工人在政治上、经济上得到了解放，并不等于思想改造的任务也完成了。因为第一，我们在旧社会受到了残酷的剥削和压迫，同时也受到了剥削阶级反动思想的侵蚀和毒害。第二，社会主义社会还存在着阶级和阶级斗争。放松思想改造，就会忘本，就会变质。第三，社会主义革命不断深入发展，如果个人利益不能服从革命利益，不能自觉革命，就不能适应社会主义革命的需要，就会在革命队伍中掉队。我们工人阶级一定要牢记毛主席的教导：“工人阶级要在阶级斗争中和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。工人阶级必须在工作中不断学习，逐步克服自己的缺点，永远也不能停止。”
        “老三篇”是破私立公、改造人们灵魂的强大思想武器
    为私还是为公，为自己还是为革命，是资产阶级和无产阶级的两种根本对立的世界观。几位五好工人认为：破私立公，灭资兴无，彻底打倒“人不为己、天诛地灭”的旧道德观念，真正树立“毫不利己专门利人”的新道德观念，是我们学习“老三篇”的根本目的。
    五好工人、七车间女工徐美英说：我在没有学习“老三篇”和毛主席其他著作以前，脑子里的私心杂念很多，不懂得为谁劳动，为啥做工。后来，学习毛主席著作，才懂得了工作就是斗争、为革命而劳动的道理。前年，厂里调做一种新产品，一道比较难做的工序不好分配。我想，毛主席教导我们：做工作不能拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。我是共产党员，应该敢挑重担，就主动把这道难做的工序接受了下来。后来生产中遇到困难，质量也不好。这时候私心杂念又冒头了。我就带着问题学习“老三篇”。毛主席说：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”我就鼓起勇气，利用业余时间苦练本领，终于经过一番努力提高了产量质量。
    徐美英说：碰到困难会有私心杂念，得到荣誉也会有私心杂念。我被评为五好工人、又被厂里树为标兵以后，脑子里又冒出“保荣誉”的念头。我带着这些问题再学“老三篇”，用“完全”“彻底”这面镜子一对照，用两个“极端”这把尺子一衡量，灵魂深处的“私”字就无处隐藏了。党和同志们评我为五好工人和学习标兵，是要求我更努力地为革命工作，更好地为人民服务。我只想“保荣誉”，不是背上了个人主义的包袱，完全违背了毛主席的教导吗？思想通了，闯劲就又来了。
    徐美英认为：要全心全意为人民服务，就要勇于向“我”字开火，敢于同“私”字搏斗。斗倒个人主义的私心，才能炼出为人民服务的红心。
    五好工人、二车间生产小组长朱富德和五好工人、五车间生产小组长张桃弟，谈到一条共同的体会：干革命要一心一意，不能讲条件：为人民服务要全心全意，也不能讲条件。讲条件，尽管各人有各人的想法，在这个问题上和那个问题上有不同的表现，归根到底，还是一个“私”字。
    朱富德说：为私还是为公的斗争，是经常会发生的。在工作中是这样，在生活中更是这样。前两年，我因为准备结婚，申请分配房子，领导上一时没有帮助我解决，我就觉得领导上对我不关心，工作就不起劲。当时，有的同志对我说：为人民服务，不能讲条件，你回去学学“老三篇”吧，看看毛主席怎么说的。我打开“老三篇”，学一遍，张思德、白求恩的光辉形象闪现在眼前，再学一遍，禁不住心跳脸发烧。我离开“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的标准太远了。我觉得，在思想改造方面，破私立公是主攻方向；在破私立公方面，每个人还得选定自己的主攻目标。选定了自己破私立公的靶子，就可以针锋相对，有的放矢，自己造自己的反，用毛泽东思想同自己灵魂深处的阶级敌人“拚刺刀”，集中力量，一个一个地打歼灭战，最后打胜破私立公这一仗。
    关心人、帮助人必须突出政治，突出毛泽东思想
    毛主席说：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”几位五好工人都认为：革命队伍里的同志之间，能不能互相关心、互相爱护、互相帮助，能不能先公后私、先人后己，是思想改造的一个重要环节，是破私立公的一个重要方面，是能不能全心全意为人民服务的一个严重考验。
    罗香生说：今年，厂里开展“一帮一，一对红”活动时，我想跟一个五好工人结成一对，心想“笃定一对红”。但是，领导上却要我跟另一个检验工结成一对。我心里很不乐意。我带着这个问题重读“老三篇”。毛主席明明教导我们“一切”革命队伍的人都要互相帮助，我为什么却偏偏要挑选“个别”呢？这不是“一事当前，先替自己打算”吗？通过这件事，使我感到，互学互帮头一条就要“同学‘老三篇’，同亮活思想”。只有把毛泽东思想作为我们统一的思想，才能有共同的语言，共同的行动，也才能真正达到互学互帮一对红的目的。
    徐美英在谈到她用毛泽东思想关心人、帮助人的体会时说：不但要从生活上、生产上关心人，更重要的是要从政治思想上关心人、帮助人，特别是要用伟大的毛泽东思想关心人、帮助人。向同志们宣传毛泽东思想，关心他们毛主席著作的学习，帮助他们用“老三篇”的思想把头脑武装起来，这是对革命同志最大的关心，最大的爱护，最大的帮助，也是最重要的为人民服务。
    五好工人、六车间生产小组长王佩伦，是活学活用“老三篇”，从毛主席著作中汲取巨大的精神力量，战胜肿瘤病魔恢复健康的。他兴奋地说：我们厂里的许多同志，都要求自己不但工作的八小时内要革命化，八小时外也要革命化；不但自己要思想红，全家也要思想红。我还想加一句，就是：不但平时要为人民服务，生了病也要为人民服务。我在医院里和疗养所里，除了尽可能给大家做点事情外，把向一同治病、疗养的人宣传毛泽东思想，把组织全家老少学习毛主席著作，当作我在病中为人民服务的最重要内容。我深深感到，在我们这个社会里，到处都是学习毛主席著作的课堂，到处都是思想改造的阵地，到处都是为人民服务的场所。
