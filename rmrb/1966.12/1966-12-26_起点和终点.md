	Starting Point and Ending Point
	Platoon Leader Jin Zhongxi

	Last year, when swimming training began, I was delighted to hear the target: I had already reached the standard of a first-class technical expert, reviewed old subjects, and maintained my original results. Would there be any problems? Therefore, during training, I only pointed out and did not train hard. Soon, the company organized a 3,000-meter armed swim. Many comrades had already swum over 3,000 meters, but I was stuck at 2,000 meters.

	What a disaster! Was it because my foundation was weak? Was it because my technique was poor? No, it was neither. Then why did I fall behind? With this question in mind, I studied the article "Put Down Your Burdens, Start Your Engines" and reflected on Chairman Mao's teachings. I realized that I had suffered from "blindness." Chairman Mao said: "Many things, as long as we fall into blindness towards them, lack self-awareness, they can become our burdens, our obstacles."

	Previously, I had swum 4,000 meters and reached the standard of a first-class technical expert, which is true; but anything can change. Those who originally had a weaker foundation can catch up through effort; those who were originally similar to me can surpass me through continuous improvement. I only wanted to stay in place, resulting in stagnation or even regression. This made me realize: a person's achievements and progress in ideological transformation and work can only be used as a starting point, not an ending point. Otherwise, one will carry a burden and be unable to move forward. I mistakenly took the starting point as the ending point, relying on my "old capital," and instead, I lost it. Later, I turned the "ending point" into a starting point, shed my burdens, started from zero, paid double the price, and only then did I achieve new results. The people of Daqing said well: achievements can only explain the past, not the present, and certainly not the future. Four thousand meters is not the end, and ten thousand meters is not the limit. On the road of ideological revolution, there is never an ending point.

    起点和终点
    班长　金忠喜
    去年游泳训练开始的时候，我一听指标就乐了：自己已经达到一级技术能手标准，复习老课目，保持原有成绩，还会有问题吗？因此，在训练中只是指指点点，不肯认真苦练。不久，连里组织三千米武装泅渡，不少同志已经游过了三千米，我却在两千米上给卡住了。
    真糟糕！是底子薄吗？是技术差吗？都不是。那么为什么落后了呢？我带着这个问题学习了《放下包袱，开动机器》这段文章，照毛主席的教导前后想了想，才知道是吃了“盲目性”的亏。毛主席说：“有许多的东西，只要我们对它们陷入盲目性，缺乏自觉性，就可能成为我们的包袱，成为我们的负担。”
    以前我游过四千米，达到了一级技术能手标准，这不假；可是，任何事物都是可以转化的。原先基础比较差的，经过努力，可以赶上来；原先跟我差不多的，精益求精，可以超到前面去；我只想在原地踏步，结果不进则退。这使我认识到：一个人在思想改造和工作上有了成绩，有了进步，只能当作起点，不能当作终点，否则就会背起包袱，压得前进不了。我错把起点当终点，想靠“老本”吃饭，反倒把“老本”蚀掉了。后来我变“终点”为起点，甩掉包袱，从零开始，付了加倍的代价，这才得到了新的成绩。大庆人说得好：成绩只能说明过去，不能说明现在，更不能说明未来。四千米不是终点，一万米也并没有到顶。在思想革命化的道路上，更是永远没有终点的。
