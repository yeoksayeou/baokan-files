Since the Xinhua News Agency dispatches from Cairo started to publish Chairman Mao's quotations every day, a freedom fighter from the Atlantic coast of Africa always cut out the quotations of Chairman Mao and kept them in a paper folder. Soon, when his friend gave him a red-covered copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" as a precious gift, he was overjoyed and repeatedly said, "Thank you very much, thank you very much..."

He cherished "Quotations from Chairman Mao" so much. However, he later gave it as a precious gift to one of his European friends. When asked why he did this, the freedom fighter said: My young friend is very disgusted with the Western propaganda attacking China, attacking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the Red Guards. He is very eager to know everything about China, so he asked me for "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Xinhua News Agency dispatches. After reading them, my friend told me, "The leader I respect the most in the world is Chairman Mao Zedong."

    珍贵礼物送友人
    自从在开罗发行的新华社新闻稿每天都选登毛主席语录之后，一位来自大西洋海岸的非洲自由战士总是把上面的毛主席语录剪下来，保存在一个纸夹里。不久，当他的朋友把红皮的《毛主席语录》作为珍贵的礼物赠送给他的时候，他万分高兴连声地说：“非常感谢你，非常感谢你……”
    他是这么珍爱《毛主席语录》。但是他后来却又把它作为珍贵的礼物转送给了他的一个欧洲朋友。当问起他为什么这样做时，这位自由战士说：我的那位年青朋友非常厌恶西方攻击中国、攻击中国文化大革命和红卫兵的宣传。他非常渴望了解中国的一切，因此他从我这里要去《毛主席语录》和新华社新闻稿。我的朋友在读过之后对我说：“世界上我最敬爱的领袖就是毛泽东主席。”
