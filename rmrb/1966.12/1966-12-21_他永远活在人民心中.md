He Lives Forever in the Hearts of the People

In November 1939, Comrade Norman Bethune operated on an infectious wound of a soldier with abdominal injuries. His fingers were infected and swollen, causing severe pain. Despite his own illness, he insisted on going to the front line. Comrades advised him to rest for a few more days, but he firmly said, "What's a little wound on the finger? I'm here to work. Don't treat me like an antique. Use me like a top-notch machine gun."

No one could persuade him otherwise. The medical team set out again. Comrade Norman Bethune rode on a horse, swaying back and forth. Along the way, some wounded soldiers were being carried down from the front line, and he blamed himself repeatedly, "I'm too late! I'm too late!" Upon reaching the medical team of a regiment in Wangjiatai, his fingers were even more swollen, and a secondary abscess had formed below his elbow joint, causing his temperature to rise. He took some internal medication and stubbornly supported himself. He instructed the translator to send a messenger to notify all combat units to send all wounded soldiers to him. He insisted on seeing all head, chest, and abdominal injuries, even waking him up if he was asleep. Later, his condition worsened, his body became cold, and he vomited continuously, speaking incoherently. The troops carried him away. He still said, "I am deeply concerned about the bleeding soldiers on the front line. If I still have some strength, I will definitely stay on the front line."

On November 11, Comrade Norman Bethune camped in Huangshikou Village, Tang County. At this time, superiors sent a messenger with an urgent letter, instructing the troops to spare no effort to safely escort Comrade Norman Bethune out of the area threatened by the enemy, to save his life. The military medical department also sent someone. The medical team took all emergency measures and surgical treatments, but the condition did not improve. Seeing the critical condition, the doctors suggested amputating his arm.

Comrade Norman Bethune shook his head and said, "Don't treat it anymore. I trust you. If it can save my life, I am willing to sacrifice both arms. Comrade, it's not just a problem in the arm; there is poison in my blood, septicemia, and there is no way out.... Please go out for a while, let me be alone for a moment."

The whole village knew that Comrade Norman Bethune was seriously ill and gathered outside the courtyard wall, listening silently. At this time, a unit passed through the village and heard that Comrade Norman Bethune was seriously ill, so they stopped. They sent a few representatives to the courtyard. The doctors only allowed them to look at Comrade Norman Bethune through the window. The soldiers crowded at the window sill, seeing the familiar face, and tears flowed down. When they left, they told the doctors, "We will use our battles to help you treat Comrade Norman Bethune's illness. He will be happy to hear the news of victory."

In the evening, Comrade Norman Bethune struggled to sit up, breathing heavily, writing his will, reporting to his superiors about his recent work and life, and suggesting the immediate organization of a surgical team to the front line for battlefield rescue. He handed the written will to the translator, took off his luminous watch as the last gift, and earnestly told the translator and doctors, "Strive on, towards the great path, and open up the future!"

At 5:20 AM on November 12, 1939, the great internationalist warrior Norman Bethune passed away, dedicating his brilliant life to the great cause of communism. (Attached picture)

    他永远活在人民心中
    一九三九年十一月间，白求恩同志给一个外科传染病伤员做手术，手指的伤口感染中毒，肿胀，痛得厉害。但他不顾自己的病，还是争着要到前线去。同志们劝他多休息几天，他坚决地说：“手指上这点小伤算什么！我是来工作的，你们不要把我当古董，要拿我当一挺顶呱呱的机关枪使用。”
    任何人的劝解都没有效果。医疗队又出发了。白求恩同志骑在马上，摇摇晃晃。路上有一些伤员从前线抬下来，他难过得连声责备自己：“来迟了！来迟了！”到达王家台一个团的卫生队，他手指肿得越发厉害，肘关节下发生转移性脓疡，体温增高。他内服一些药，又顽强地支撑起来。他叫翻译派通讯员去通知各战斗部队，把所有的伤员一齐送到他这儿来。凡是头部、胸部、腹部受伤的伤员，一定要抬来给他看，即使睡着了，也要叫醒他。后来，他病情越来越重，浑身发冷，接连呕吐，说话也没有条理了。部队抬着他转移。他还说：“我十二分忧虑的是前方流血的战士。假使我还有一点支持的力量，我一定留在前方。”
    十一月十一日，白求恩同志宿营在唐县黄石口村。这时，上级派人送来了急信，要部队不惜任何代价安全地把白求恩同志送出这个在敌人威胁下的区域，挽救白求恩同志的生命。军区卫生部也派人来了。医疗队的大夫采取一切紧急措施和外科处理，病情仍不见好转。眼看病情危急，大夫们建议他把胳膊割掉。
    白求恩同志摇摇头说：“不要治了，我是信任你们的。只要能挽救生命，我牺牲两条胳膊都愿意。同志，已经不单是胳膊里的问题了，我的血里有毒，败血症，没有办法了。……请你们出去一会，让我一个人安静一下。……”
    全村人都知道了白求恩同志病重，聚集在院墙外面倾听着，谁也不说话。这时候，一支部队经过这个村庄，听说白求恩同志病重，都不走了。他们派了几个代表来到院子里。医生只允许他们从窗户里看一看白求恩同志，战士们挤在窗台前，看到了他们所熟悉的面容，都流下了眼泪。走的时候，他们跟医生说：“我们要用战斗来帮助你们治疗白求恩同志的病，他听到胜利的消息一定会高兴的。”
    到了晚上，白求恩同志勉强坐了起来，沉重地呼吸着，写遗嘱，向上级报告他最近工作和生活的情形，建议立即组织手术队到前方做战地救护。他把写好的遗嘱交给翻译，解下手上的夜光表作为最后的礼物，谆谆地对翻译和医生们说：“努力吧，向着伟大的路，开辟前面的事业！”
    一九三九年十一月十二日凌晨五点二十分，伟大的国际主义战士白求恩逝世了，他为了伟大的共产主义事业，贡献出了他光辉的一生。（附图片）
