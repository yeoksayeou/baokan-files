Recently, at a gathering in Yamagata Prefecture where Japanese youth welcomed the Chinese delegation, a young teacher enthusiastically shared his insights on studying Chairman Mao's work "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" with Chinese comrades.

The young teacher said: "After reading Chairman Mao's 'The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains' and other articles, I felt that I gained a lot. The Japanese people also have two big mountains on their backs: one is American imperialism, and the other is Japanese monopoly capital. Chairman Mao's article gave the Japanese people great courage and strength, encouraging the Japanese people to unite and fight together to remove these two mountains that weigh heavily on the Japanese people."

He continued: "Chairman Mao's words are not only the guide for China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, but also a treasure for the world's revolutionary people."

After sharing his study insights, he immediately excitedly sang in Chinese, "The East is red, the sun is rising, from China comes Mao Zedong..." The entire audience joined in singing loudly. The venue was filled with an atmosphere of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

    从《愚公移山》中得到了勇气和力量
    不久前，在日本山黎县青年欢迎中国代表团的一次集会上，有一位青年教员热情地向中国同志谈起他学习毛主席著作《愚公移山》的体会。
    这位青年教员说：“读了毛主席的《愚公移山》等文章后，我感到有很大收获。日本人民身上也压着两座大山：一座是美帝国主义，一座是日本垄断资本。毛主席的这篇文章使日本人民得到了极大的勇气和力量，鼓励了日本人民团结起来，共同战斗，搬掉压在日本人民头上的这两座大山。”
    他又说：“毛主席的话，不仅是中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的指南，也是世界人民革命的法宝。”
    他把学习体会谈完，马上兴奋地用中国话高声唱起“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……”的歌曲。顿时，全场都跟着高声合唱。会场上充满了一片对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的气氛。
