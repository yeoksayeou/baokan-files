	We should make every comrade understand that as long as we rely on the people, firmly believe that the creative power of the masses is boundless, and thus trust the people and unite with them, then no difficulty can be insurmountable, and no enemy can defeat us; instead, they will be defeated by us.

	From "On Coalition Government"

    毛主席语录
    应该使每一个同志懂得，只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。
　  《论联合政府》
