	In the midst of the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary art workers, in response to the demands of the broad revolutionary masses, have recently reproduced all the clay sculptures from the "Rent Collection Courtyard" at the Class Education Museum in Daxian, Sichuan, and have meticulously revised and re-created them. This has emphasized the theme that the oppressed people must take the path of armed struggle, thereby raising the ideological and artistic levels of the works to new heights.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: Where there is exploitation, there is oppression; where there is oppression, there is resistance and struggle. It is in accordance with this brilliant thought of Chairman Mao that the art workers have revised and reproduced the clay sculptures of "The Rent Collection Courtyard." The re-created sculptures enthusiastically praise the indomitable spirit of the peasants in their heart-rending class struggles and successfully portray the glorious image of the poor and lower-middle peasants, under the leadership of the Party, consciously taking the path of armed struggle.

	The clay sculptures of "The Rent Collection Courtyard," along with many excellent works that have emerged in the realms of Peking Opera reform, ballet reform, and symphonic music reform, are all shining examples of the practice of Chairman Mao's literary line. They represent a great leap forward in the revolutionization, popularization, and nationalization of literature and art. The creation and revision process of "The Rent Collection Courtyard" once again powerfully demonstrates the invincible and unassailable might of Mao Zedong Thought; it proves that in artistic creation, only by resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's literary line, by listening to the opinions of the masses, by continuously revising and improving, and by striving for perfection, can works be produced that are useful to and loved by the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

	Seize the rifle from the landlord's hand,
	Hatred is concentrated in the muzzle.
	Raise the red flag and make revolution,
	Follow the Communist Party forever.

	Who sucks my blood?
	Who takes my food?
	Who makes me poor and bitter?
	The evil landlord is a wolf!
	A year of hard work for whom?
	The landlord enjoys the blood and sweat of the poor!
	Frowning coldly at the bloodsucker,
	The fire of struggle fills the chest!
	Thousands of years of hatred, millions of years of enmity,
	The peasants and landlords are mortal enemies.
	To gain liberation, rely on armed struggle,
	Overthrow the exploiters, gain freedom!
	The Party's teachings are in my heart,
	The system of exploitation must be overturned.
	With determination, make revolution,
	March forward with heads held high.

    在毛泽东文艺思想指导下不断加工精益求精
    ——泥塑《收租院》再创造的部分作品选登
    编者按：在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，革命的美术工作者根据广大革命群众的要求，最近在北京又重新复制了四川大邑阶级教育馆《收租院》全部泥塑群像，并认真地进行了加工修改和再创造，突出了被压迫人民只有走武装斗争道路的主题，从而使作品的思想性和艺术性有了新的提高。
    毛主席教导我们：哪里有剥削，有压迫，哪里就有反抗，有斗争。美术工作者们就是按照毛主席这一光辉思想对泥塑《收租院》进行修改和复制的。再创造以后的泥塑，热情地歌颂了农民在惊心动魄的阶级斗争中英勇不屈的反抗精神，成功地塑造了贫下中农在党的领导下，自觉地走上武装斗争道路的光辉形象。
    泥塑《收租院》和京剧改革、芭蕾舞剧改革、交响音乐改革等方面出现的许多优秀作品一样，都是实践毛主席文艺路线的光辉样板，都是文艺革命化、大众化、民族化的一个大飞跃。《收租院》的创作和修改过程，再一次有力地证明了毛泽东思想战无不胜、攻无不克的巨大威力；证明了在美术创作中只有坚决执行毛主席的文艺路线，根据群众意见，不断修改，不断提高，精益求精，才能产生出为工农兵所利用，为工农兵所喜爱的好作品。（附图片）
    夺过地主手中枪，　仇恨凝在枪口上。
  　高举红旗闹革命，　永远跟着共产党。
    是谁吸我身上血？　是谁夺我口中粮？
    是谁使我穷和苦？　万恶地主活豺狼！
    一年辛苦为谁忙？！　穷人血汗地主享！
    横眉冷对吸血鬼，　斗争怒火满胸膛！
    千年的恨，万世的仇，　农民地主死对头。
    要得解放靠武装，　打倒剥削者，翻身得自由！
    党的教导记心间，　剥削制度要打翻。
    下定决心闹革命，　昂首阔步永向前。
