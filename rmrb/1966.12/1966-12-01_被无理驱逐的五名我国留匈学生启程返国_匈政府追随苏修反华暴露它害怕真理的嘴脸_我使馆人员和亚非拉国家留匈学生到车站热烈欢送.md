Five Chinese students, who were unjustly stripped of their right to study and ordered to leave school by the Hungarian government, departed from Budapest by train on the evening of the 20th to return home. Chinese Ambassador to Hungary Han Kexu, the entire staff of the Chinese Embassy, and many Asian, African, and Latin American students studying in Hungary went to the station to see them off.

At the station, the Chinese Embassy staff in Hungary presented each of the five students with a flower of honor. Students from many countries bid farewell to their Chinese classmates, encouraging each other. A student from an Asian country said to the Chinese students, "Our hearts are forever united, and our friendship cannot be broken by anyone." An African student said, "The attempts by U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries to obstruct the progress of the Chinese people are in vain. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the world revolution will continue to surge forward regardless of any circumstances."

Some Hungarians present said to the Chinese comrades that the Hungarian government's expulsion of Chinese students was "very dishonorable." An old worker said, "We workers want to be friends with the Chinese people. The Communist Party of China is the true Communist Party, and Hungarian workers will never put down the red flag."

As the students were about to board the train, students from various countries repeatedly shook hands, hugged, and took photos together with the Chinese students. After the five Chinese students boarded the train, they joined the people who came to see them off in raising the red and shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and together sang "The East Is Red" and "The Boatman's Song."

Before the Chinese students left Budapest to return home, the entire staff of the Chinese Embassy in Hungary held a warm farewell party for the Chinese students.

Ambassador Han Kexu spoke at the meeting, strongly protesting the Hungarian government's unjust stripping of the right to study in Hungary for five Chinese students. He said, "The Hungarian government's expulsion of five Chinese students is a serious step in its pursuit of the Soviet revisionist clique's intensification of anti-China activities."

Chinese student representative Wang Lixian spoke at the meeting, saying, "The Hungarian government is so afraid of us, these Chinese youths in their twenties, that it expels us because it is extremely afraid of the truth, afraid of Mao Zedong Thought. However, the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought cannot be obscured by a few buzzing flies that hit the wall."

The five Chinese students also held a reception on the evening of the 18th to bid farewell to their foreign classmates. Over a hundred students from more than twenty countries attended this reception.

Chinese student representative Liu Ligui, in his speech at the reception, exposed and condemned the Hungarian government's deliberate worsening of relations between the two countries and its sabotage of the friendship between the two peoples. His speech was met with enthusiastic sympathy and support from foreign students.

A student from an Asian country said to the Chinese students, "The Hungarian government's expulsion of you is a bad thing, but it can also turn into a good thing, making us see more clearly the face of the revisionists."

A student from Latin America said, "The Hungarian government's actions do not harm you in the slightest, but their revisionist face has been exposed once again."

At the reception, Chinese students gave their Mao Zedong badges to some foreign students as the most precious mementos.

A student from Latin America asked the Chinese students to write in Chinese in his "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong! Long live the world revolution!" Another student from Latin America asked the Chinese students to write "Study Mao Zedong Thought diligently" as an encouragement to himself. Some Vietnamese and Laotian students, when bidding farewell, asked the Chinese students to convey their greetings to Chairman Mao.

On November 30, the five Chinese students who were unjustly expelled by the Hungarian government arrived in Beijing, the capital of their great motherland, by train, returning to the side of their most beloved and respected great leader, Chairman Mao. Over a thousand Red Guards and revolutionary masses from the capital enthusiastically welcomed the return of our country's glorious anti-revisionist fighters to the great motherland.

    被无理驱逐的五名我国留匈学生启程返国
    匈政府追随苏修反华暴露它害怕真理的嘴脸
    我使馆人员和亚非拉国家留匈学生到车站热烈欢送
    新华社三十日讯　布达佩斯消息：被匈牙利政府无理剥夺学习权利并勒令限期离校的五名中国留学生，二十日晚上乘火车离开布达佩斯回国。中国驻匈牙利大使韩克华，大使馆全体同志，以及在匈牙利的许多亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的留学生前往车站送行。
    在车站上，中国驻匈牙利大使馆的同志给五名留学生都佩戴上一朵光荣花。许多国家的留学生纷纷向中国同学依依话别，互相勉励。一位亚洲国家的同学对中国留学生说：“我们的心是永远连在一起的，我们的友谊是谁也打不断的”。一位非洲同学说：“美帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派阻挠中国人民前进，这是徒劳的。世界革命在毛主席的领导下，不管出现什么情况，都将蓬勃地向前发展”。
    在场的一些匈牙利人对中国同志说，匈牙利政府赶走中国留学生这件事“做得很不体面”。一位老工人说：“我们工人是要同中国人民友好的。中国共产党是真正的共产党，匈牙利工人永远不会放下红旗。”
    在即将上车的时候，各国留学生一再同中国同学握手、拥抱和一起拍照留念。五名中国学生上车后同前往送行的人们一起高举红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，齐声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》和《东方红》等歌曲。
    在中国留学生离布达佩斯回国前夕，中国驻匈牙利大使馆全体同志为中国留学生举行了热烈的欢送会。
    韩克华大使在会上讲话，强烈抗议匈牙利政府无理剥夺五名中国学生在匈牙利学习的合法权利。他说：“匈牙利政府赶走五名中国留学生是它追随苏联修正主义集团加紧反华的一个严重步骤。”
    中国留学生代表王利贤在会上讲话说：“匈牙利政府如此害怕我们这些二十岁左右的中国青年，把我们赶走，这是因为他们极其害怕真理，害怕毛泽东思想。但是毛泽东思想的光辉是不能被几个嗡嗡叫的碰壁苍蝇所遮住的”。
    中国的五名留学生，十八日晚上还举行了酒会，向他们的外国同学告别。参加这次酒会的有来自二十多个国家的一百多名同学。
    中国留学生代表刘立贵在酒会上讲话时，揭露并谴责了匈牙利政府蓄意恶化中匈两国关系，破坏两国人民友谊的行径。他的讲话受到外国留学生的热烈同情和支持。
    一位亚洲学生对中国同学说：“匈牙利政府赶走你们是坏事，但也能变成好事，使我们更进一步看清楚了修正主义者的嘴脸。”
    一位拉丁美洲的学生说：“匈牙利政府这样做无损你们的一根毫毛，而他们的修正主义面目却遭到了又一次的暴露。”
    在会上，中国同学把自己的毛主席像章送给一些外国同学，作为最珍贵的纪念。
    一位拉丁美洲同学请中国留学生给他在《毛主席语录》本上用中文写上“毛泽东主席万岁！世界革命万岁！”。另一位拉丁美洲同学要中国留学生给他写上“努力学习毛泽东思想”作为对自己的勉励。一些越南和老挝的同学在告别时，要求中国留学生转达他们对毛主席的问候。（附图片）
    十一月三十日，被匈牙利政府无理赶回国的我国五名留匈学生乘火车到达伟大祖国的首都——北京，回到他们日夜想念的最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席身边。首都红卫兵小将和革命群众一千多人到车站热烈欢迎我国光荣的反修战士返回伟大祖国。
