According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 8th, according to the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, the liberation armed forces in Binh Dinh, Ninh Thuan, and other provinces in South Vietnam have recently been continuously attacking enemy convoys and outposts, achieving great victories.

On the afternoon of December 2, on the first national highway from Spring Lu County in Binh Dinh Province to Cao Lanh County in Dinh Tuong Province, the liberation armed forces attacked an armored convoy of the U.S. 11th Independent Armored Cavalry Regiment. According to preliminary reports, the liberation armed forces used only 18 minutes to annihilate this convoy, which consisted of seven M-41 tanks and M-113 amphibious armored personnel carriers, almost completely wiping out the American invaders on the vehicles. Subsequently, the liberation armed forces fiercely intercepted more than a hundred enemy vehicles sent for reinforcement, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

This is the third time in less than a month that the liberation armed forces in Binh Dinh Province have struck the U.S. 11th Independent Armored Cavalry Regiment. Previously, in November, the liberation armed forces had twice attacked this armored regiment, destroying 165 armored personnel carriers, tanks, and other military vehicles, and annihilating hundreds of American invaders.

On November 29, the liberation armed forces in Ninh Thuan Province attacked an enemy convoy on the 20th national highway from Phuoc Long County to Tuy Hoa County, destroying three enemy armored personnel carriers and nine transport vehicles, annihilating an entire company of enemy regular troops and one platoon each of paramilitary forces and self-defense forces, and seizing a large number of weapons and military supplies. At the same time, they shot down an enemy reconnaissance aircraft, killing the two American bandits on board.

The military and civilians of Tuy Hoa County also destroyed three enemy vehicles and annihilated 30 enemy soldiers on November 26 on this highway.

The report said that on the night of December 19, about 10 kilometers northwest of the town of Son Ha in Quang Ngai Province, the liberation armed forces launched a fierce attack on an outpost of the South Korean puppet forces, engaging in a fierce melee with the enemy, annihilating an entire company of enemy forces, and seizing many weapons.
