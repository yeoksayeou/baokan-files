The imperialists of America and all other pests have already prepared their own gravediggers. The day of their burial will not be long in coming.

The People's Republic of China has stood on the earth for seventeen years. Yet, the United Nations, controlled by American imperialism, has year after year discussed the so-called issue of China's representation. This is utterly absurd!

The United States has excluded China from the United Nations, but this has not harmed us in the slightest. Contrary to the wishes of American imperialism, over the past seventeen years, the Chinese people, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have become increasingly prosperous and powerful. Our international prestige is growing higher and higher. Our friends are all over the world. The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is sweeping the nation, has shaken the world and made our country the center of global attention.

To resist China's great influence and to counter the strong demands of the peoples of various countries for the restoration of China's legitimate rights, the United States has played many tricks in this session of the United Nations General Assembly.

The United States has activated the voting machine to once again pass a proposal that the restoration of China's legitimate rights requires a two-thirds majority. This trick can be put to rest! China's legitimate rights in the United Nations do not need any approval from anyone.

The United States, through Italy and other countries, proposed a "six-nation proposal," claiming to establish a "committee" to "conduct the most thorough research" on the "issue of China's representation" and seek a "solution." The United States also instigated Canada to propose a "three-point plan" advocating "two Chinas." These are new tricks played by the United States in this session of the General Assembly.

The "six-nation proposal" pretends to be "impartial" in seeking a so-called "solution." In reality, this is to find a way out of the dilemma of the United States in obstructing the restoration of China's representation and to seek a way to implement the U.S. plot to create "two Chinas." The "six-nation proposal" and Canada's "three-point plan" are all aimed at allowing the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to remain in the United Nations and to promote the plot of "two Chinas." The Italian representative spoke quite blatantly, saying that the "1,200 million people in Taiwan" have the right to self-determination. It is absurd to the extreme to suggest that Chinese people need to hold a vote to decide whether they are Chinese or not. This is a blatant violation of China's sacred sovereignty. In this session of the General Assembly, the "six-nation proposal" is very unpopular and has been strongly opposed by many countries that uphold justice. Any such trick that serves the U.S. policy of aggression and the plot to create "two Chinas" is doomed to fail.

The Soviet leadership clique played a despicable two-faced game in this session of the General Assembly. On the one hand, it pretended to "support" the restoration of China's legitimate rights, while on the other hand, it widely distributed a vicious, arrogant, and comprehensive anti-China article from Pravda before the vote. The Soviet leadership clique's shameful act of closely coordinating with the United States and jointly opposing China has further exposed its traitorous face.

Over the past decade, many friendly countries have fought in the United Nations against the United States' illegal seizure of China's legitimate rights. In this session of the United Nations General Assembly, Albania, Algeria, Cambodia, Congo (Brazzaville), Cuba, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Pakistan, Romania, and Syria jointly proposed a resolution, advocating the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations and firmly demanding the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Many countries that uphold justice have also spoken out in support. The Chinese people express their gratitude for these just and friendly actions.

The result of the vote on the issue of China's representation in this session of the General Assembly once again proves that without breaking the United States' control over the United Nations, it is impossible to expel the Chiang bandits and restore China's legitimate rights.

The fundamental issue now is how to free the United Nations from the control of the United States and its accomplices, thoroughly reform the United Nations, and correct all its errors.

We must frankly tell American imperialism: The Chinese people have no need of the United Nations.

Chairman Mao said: "Our enemies are shortsighted; they do not see the great power of our domestic and international unity. They do not see that the era of foreign imperialists bullying the Chinese people has been permanently ended by the founding of the People's Republic of China." The American imperialists and their followers who persist in their anti-China policy within the United Nations are just a bunch of frogs in a well. It can be asserted that the situation of American imperialism controlling the United Nations will be broken. The era of the affairs of all countries being managed by the peoples of all countries will surely come.

### 中国无求于联合国

    中国无求于联合国
    美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫已经准备好了自己的掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。
    中华人民共和国屹立在地球上，已经十七年了。可是，美帝国主义控制下的联合国却年复一年地讨论所谓中国代表权问题。这真是荒唐透顶！
    美国把中国排除在联合国之外，损伤不了我们一根毫毛。同美帝国主义的愿望相反，十七年来，中国人民在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，日益繁荣和强大起来了。我们的国际威望越来越高。我们的朋友遍天下。当前正在轰轰烈烈开展的无产阶级文化大革命，震动全世界，更使我国成为举世瞩目的中心。
    为了抵挡中国的巨大影响，为了抗拒各国人民主张恢复中国合法权利的强烈要求，美国在这一届联合国大会上，又玩了许多花样。
    美国开动表决机器，再一次通过了所谓恢复中国合法权利是一个需要三分之二多数才能决定的提案。这种把戏，可以休矣！中国在联合国的合法权利，根本不需要任何人批准。
    美国通过意大利等国，提出一个“六国提案”，说什么要成立一个“委员会”，对“中国代表权问题”“进行最彻底的研究”，寻求“解决办法”。美国又唆使加拿大提出鼓吹“两个中国”的“三点计划”。这是美国在本届联大上搞的新名堂。
    “六国提案”装出“不偏袒任何一方”的样子，来寻求一个所谓“解决办法”。说穿了，这是为摆脱美国在阻挠恢复中国代表权问题上的困境“寻求解决办法”，是为推行美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋“寻求解决办法”。“六国提案”和加拿大的“三点计划”，都是要让蒋介石匪帮赖在联合国里，都是要推行“两个中国”的阴谋。意大利代表说得十分露骨，“台湾的一千二百万人”“有权实行自决”。中国人竟然需要举行投票来决定自己是不是中国人，这真是荒谬绝伦到了极点，这是对中国神圣主权的明目张胆的侵犯。在这届联大上，“六国提案”是很不得人心的，遭到许多主持正义的国家的强烈反对。任何这一类为美国侵略政策和制造“两个中国”的阴谋服务的诡计，都是注定要破产的。
    苏联领导集团在这届联大上玩弄了卑鄙的两面手法。它一面装出“支持”恢复中国的合法权利，一面却在表决前广泛散发《真理报》的一篇恶毒地、猖狂地、全面地攻击我国的反华文章。苏联领导集团同美国密切配合、联合反华的这个可耻行径，更加赤裸裸地暴露了它的叛徒嘴脸。
    十几年来，许多友好国家在联合国中，同美国非法剥夺中国合法权利的行径进行了斗争。在这一届联合国大会上，阿尔巴尼亚、阿尔及利亚、柬埔寨、刚果
  （布）、古巴、几内亚、马里、毛里塔尼亚、巴基斯坦、罗马尼亚和叙利亚等十一国联合提出提案，主张恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，坚决要求把蒋介石匪帮赶走。许多主持正义的国家，也仗义执言。中国人民对于这种正义的、友好的行动表示感谢。
    本届联大关于中国代表权问题进行表决的结果再一次证明，不打破美国对联合国的控制，要驱逐蒋帮分子，恢复中国的合法权利，是不可能的。
    现在的根本问题，仍然是如何使联合国摆脱美国及其合伙者的控制，彻底改组联合国，彻底纠正它的一切错误。
    我们要坦率地奉告美帝国主义：中国人民无求于联合国。
    毛主席说：“我们的敌人眼光短浅，他们看不到我们这种国内国际伟大团结的力量，他们看不到由外国帝国主义欺负中国人民的时代，已由中华人民共和国的成立而永远宣告结束了。”在联合国内坚持敌视中国政策的美帝国主义及其追随者，就是这样一群井底之蛙。可以断言，美帝国主义控制联合国的局面，必将打破。世界各国的事务由各国人民自己管理的时代，必将到来。
