	"Lived in a Great School of Mao Zedong Thought"

	Editor's Note: Recently, the People's Liberation Army sent a large number of cadres and soldiers to receive and accommodate over 2.5 million Red Guards and revolutionary students who came to Beijing for linkage visits. The cadres, soldiers, and political workers of the People's Liberation Army, filled with deep class sentiments, enthusiastically received the guests invited by Chairman Mao. They held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, personally practiced and spread Mao Zedong Thought, and promoted the fine traditions and style of the People's Liberation Army. This educated over 2.5 million Red Guards and revolutionary students in a vivid way about Mao Zedong Thought and the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army.

	The People's Liberation Army is a people's army with high political awareness and strong organizational discipline, personally founded by Chairman Mao. The broad cadres and soldiers are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, infinitely loyal to the Party, and infinitely loyal to the people. They study and apply Chairman Mao's works well and are models for the broad Red Guards and revolutionary students to learn from. In this reception work, they did not leave Chairman Mao's books, did not leave Chairman Mao's words, did not leave Mao Zedong Thought, and did not leave Chairman Mao's instructions in their actions. They truly put the public first, selflessly serving others, and numerous touching good deeds emerged.

	The Red Guards were developed under the care and support of the great leader Chairman Mao. The Red Guards love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. As soon as they were born, they loudly proposed to take the People's Liberation Army as their model. The Red Guards who came to Beijing for linkage visits all felt that being able to live and learn directly from the People's Liberation Army was the greatest care from the great leader Chairman Mao.

	The People's Liberation Army's method of guiding the Red Guards has great political significance. It will have a profound impact on the ideological and organizational construction of the Red Guards, on the ideological revolution of the younger generation, and on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Comrade Pan Yundé from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army was dispatched to receive the Red Guards and served as the platoon leader. The deputy platoon leader, Hai Wan Kun, was elected by the Red Guards themselves. The entire platoon of Red Guards came from all over the country, and their living habits were different. Hai Wan Kun is an impatient person who wanted to quickly make the entire platoon neat and orderly. Whenever he saw someone playing around or having shortcomings, he would criticize them harshly. Therefore, some students had complaints about him.

	Comrade Pan Yundé saw this situation and said to Hai Wan Kun, "Helping comrades correct their shortcomings should not be done in a harsh manner." The deputy platoon leader said, "I am responsible to the revolution." Pan Yundé said, "That's right. But helping comrades must be done patiently." The deputy platoon leader still disagreed, "Strict requirements are the greatest help."

	As soon as Pan Yundé arrived among the Red Guards, he had an idea: I will use Mao Zedong Thought to receive the Red Guards and let them spread Mao Zedong Thought to the five lakes and four seas.

	Later, Pan Yundé found Hai Wan Kun to study Chairman Mao's works together. They first studied the section on the main contradictions and the main aspects of contradictions in "On Contradiction," and then the part about the development and change of things, where internal causes are the basis for change and external causes are the conditions for change. Then, he had the deputy platoon leader open "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to page 131 and read the last section, which says that one can only persuade comrades of their shortcomings and errors, not force them. The result of forcing is always to force without persuading, and using force to persuade is not acceptable. After reading, he guided the deputy platoon leader to analyze and recognize the problems in the platoon. Hai Wan Kun thought for a while and excitedly said, "Chairman Mao's words are so good, they hit the nail on the head."

	Hai Wan Kun truly changed after that. Some comrades in the second class ran to the canteen to eat during roll call, and he chased after them, intending to criticize them harshly; but remembering Comrade Pan Yundé's words, "At critical moments, remember Chairman Mao's instructions," he found those Red Guards, first persuaded them, and then read to them Chairman Mao's quotations about organizational discipline, smoothly solving the problem.

	The platoon leaders were about to part ways. The night before Hai Wan Kun left, he said to Comrade Pan Yundé, "The People's Liberation Army is truly great. This time I lived in a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. I promise to learn from the comrades of the People's Liberation Army and strive to spread Mao Zedong Thought for life."

### “住了一次毛泽东思想的大学校”

    “住了一次毛泽东思想的大学校”
    编者按：最近，人民解放军派出大批干部战士，参加接待来京串连的二百五十多万红卫兵和革命师生。人民解放军干部战士和政治工作人员们，满怀深厚的阶级感情，极端热忱地接待了毛主席请来的客人。他们处处高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，身体力行地传播了毛泽东思想，传播了解放军的优良传统和作风，使二百五十多万红卫兵和革命师生，受到了一次生动的毛泽东思想教育和人民解放军光荣传统的教育。
    人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的具有高度政治觉悟和高度组织性纪律性的人民军队。广大干部战士无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于党，无限忠于人民。他们对毛主席著作学得好，用得好，是广大红卫兵和革命师生学习的榜样。在这次接待工作中，他们身不离毛主席的书，口不离毛主席的话，心不离毛泽东思想，行动不离毛主席的教导，真正作到了公字当头，毫不利己专门利人，出现了大量感人肺腑的好人好事。
    红卫兵是在伟大领袖毛主席的关怀和支持下发展起来的。红卫兵热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想。它一诞生，就响亮地提出，以解放军为榜样。这次来京串连的红卫兵，都认为能和解放军朝夕相处，直接向解放军学习，是伟大领袖毛主席对他们的最大关怀。
    解放军带红卫兵的做法，具有重大的政治意义，对于红卫兵的思想建设和组织建设，对于青年一代的思想革命化，对于无产阶级文化大革命，都将产生极为深刻的影响。
    解放军某部潘运德同志，被派去接待红卫兵，担任红卫兵排长。副排长海万坤，是由红卫兵自己推选的。全排红卫兵，来自山南海北，生活习惯都不一样。海万坤是个急性子人，恨不得一下子把全排搞得整整齐齐，一看见有人爱玩爱闹或者有缺点，就狠狠地批评。因此，有些同学对他有意见。
    潘运德同志看到这种情况，就对海万坤说：“帮助同志改正缺点，态度不能生硬。”副排长说：“我是对革命负责。”潘运德说：“这对。可是对同志帮助一定要耐心。”副排长还是不服：“严格要求，就是最大的帮助。”
    潘运德一到红卫兵中间，就有一个想法：我要用毛泽东思想来接待红卫兵，让他们把毛泽东思想传播到五湖四海去。
    后来，潘运德找到海万坤一起学习毛主席著作。先学了《矛盾论》中主要的矛盾和主要的矛盾方面一节，又学了事物的发展和变化，内因是变化的根据，外因是变化的条件一段。然后，他又让副排长打开《毛主席语录》第一百三十一页，读了最后一节，这一节是说对同志的缺点和错误，只能说服，不能压服，压服的结果总是压而不服，以力服人是不行的。读完，便引导副排长分析、认识排里的问题。海万坤沉思一会儿，激动地说：“毛主席说得真好，全说到我的病根上了。”
    海万坤从此真的改变了。二班的一些同志，在出操的时候跑到食堂去吃饭，他追了上去，本想狠狠地批评一顿；但想起潘运德同志说的，“在要紧的时刻，要记住毛主席的教导。”他找到那几个红卫兵，先是说服他们，后来又给他们念毛主席有关组织性纪律性的语录，顺利地解决了这个问题。
    正副排长要分手了。海万坤走的前一天晚上，对潘运德同志说：“解放军真好。这次我住了一次毛泽东思想的大学校。我保证，今后一定要向解放军同志学习，努力传播一辈子毛泽东思想。”
