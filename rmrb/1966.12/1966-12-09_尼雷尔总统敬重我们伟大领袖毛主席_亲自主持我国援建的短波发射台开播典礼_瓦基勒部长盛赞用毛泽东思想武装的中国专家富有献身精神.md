Wakilé Minister praises Chinese experts armed with Mao Zedong Thought for their selfless spirit.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam, December 7th: Tanzanian President Nyerere presided over the formal inauguration ceremony of the shortwave broadcasting station built with Chinese aid in Dar es Salaam on the 7th.

After the grand inauguration ceremony, Nyerere, accompanied by Chinese Ambassador He Ying, inspected the broadcasting station. At the beginning of the inspection, Nyerere, with deep affection for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, said he hoped to see a portrait of Chairman Mao in the broadcasting station. When he saw the portrait of Chairman Mao in the office of the Chinese experts, he happily said, "Chairman Mao is here! Excellent!" Nyerere repeatedly praised the hardworking and simple lifestyle of the Chinese experts during the construction of the broadcasting station.

In his speech at the inauguration ceremony, Tanzanian Minister of Information and Tourism Wakilé highly praised the Chinese experts, who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, as "selfless workers." He said, "It is hard to believe that the first-class engineers who built such a magnificent building and broadcasting station live in these wooden houses." While some experts from other countries "wish to live in high-rise buildings."

Minister Wakilé also praised the machinery and equipment provided by China, saying they are ideal and have good broadcasting effects.

Minister Wakilé said that through this broadcasting station, Tanzania will further support African brothers who are struggling to overthrow colonialism.

Chinese Ambassador to Tanzania He Ying, representing the Government of the People's Republic of China, said in his speech at the ceremony that the Tanzanian people, under the outstanding leadership of President Nyerere, have achieved tremendous success in maintaining and consolidating independence and sovereignty, developing the national economy and national culture. Ambassador He Ying said, "President Nyerere's emphasis on the correct policy of self-reliance in national construction has received the heartfelt support of the people and is increasingly effective."

Ambassador He Ying said that the successful completion of this broadcasting station not only sets an example for increasing economic and technological cooperation between China and Tanzania but also strengthens the friendship between the two peoples. He pointed out, "Those who want to sabotage the friendship between China and Tanzania are doomed to fail."

The construction of the broadcasting station began at the end of last year and was completed in September this year, three months ahead of schedule.
