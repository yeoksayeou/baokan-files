The South Vietnamese Liberation Army has firmly grasped the initiative on the battlefield, delivering a powerful blow to the U.S. "elite" forces. The liberation armed forces in Gia Lai and Kon Tum provinces have completely annihilated two companies and four platoons of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 2nd: According to the South Vietnamese Liberation Radio, from November 21st to 26th, the liberation armed forces in Gia Lai and Kon Tum provinces launched a series of fierce attacks on the enemy. They completely annihilated two companies and four platoons of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division.

On November 21st, the liberation armed forces in Gia Lai Province launched a fierce attack on a U.S. military outpost on Route 19, annihilating an entire company of U.S. troops and shooting down two enemy aircraft. On the 26th, the liberation forces in the same province again annihilated another U.S. company on Route 19.

On November 20th and 22nd, the liberation armed forces in Kon Tum Province successively attacked the base of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, annihilating four enemy platoons. On the 24th, the liberation forces shot down two U.S. aircraft.

According to another report from the Liberation News Agency, on the night of November 25th, the liberation armed forces in Phuoc Long Province took advantage of the thousands of U.S. invaders fleeing to Phuoc Long Province after suffering a heavy defeat in the Xuyen Moc battlefield. They launched a sudden and fierce attack on the oil storage facility at the Phuoc Long airfield and the forward command post of the U.S. invaders conducting "sweeping" operations. They killed and wounded more than 300 U.S. invaders, destroyed 10 enemy aircraft, two cannons, and many military vehicles.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 3rd: According to a report from the South Vietnamese Liberation News Agency, on November 10th, the guerrillas in Binh Dinh Province cleverly infiltrated the town of Tuy Hoa, burning down an oil storage facility containing 125,000 liters of gasoline and a helicopter parked near the warehouse.

According to a recent commentary in the Vietnamese "People's Army" newspaper, the current so-called "dry season offensive" by the U.S. aggressors will inevitably suffer even more severe defeats than the previous "dry season offensive."

The commentary states that over the past year, the U.S. has continued to send 200,000 more troops to the South, but it still feels that its troops cannot meet the demands of the battlefield.

The commentary states that compared to the beginning of the last dry season, the main forces of the liberation armed forces have grown rapidly, and guerrilla warfare has developed from the mountains to the plains, from rural areas to cities, forcing the already scattered U.S. aggressors to become even more dispersed.

The commentary concludes that on various battlefields in South Vietnam, the U.S. aggressors are suffering continuous, heavy defeats. The heroic South Vietnamese liberation armed forces are firmly grasping the initiative on the battlefield and are determined to achieve even greater victories.

The South Vietnamese Liberation Army is growing stronger with each battle. The image shows brave South Vietnamese Liberation Army soldiers charging at the enemy in a battle.

    南越解放军抡起铁拳痛击美帝“王牌军”
    嘉莱和昆嵩两省解放武装力量全歼美骑一师两个连四个排
    新华社河内二日电  据越南南方解放电台广播：越南南方嘉莱省和昆嵩省解放武装力量从十一月二十一日到二十六日，连续向敌人展开猛烈进攻，全歼美国第一骑兵师两个连和四个排。
    十一月二十一日，嘉莱省解放武装力量猛烈袭击第十九号公路上的一个美军据点，全歼美军一个连，击落敌机两架。二十六日，这个省的解放武装力量又在十九号公路上歼灭美军另一个连。
    十一月二十日和二十二日，昆嵩省解放武装力量接连袭击美国第一骑兵师驻地，全歼敌人四个排。二十四日，解放武装力量又击毁美国飞机两架。
    另据解放通讯社报道：越南南方土龙木省解放武装力量，十一月二十五日夜间趁成千名美国侵略者在西宁战场遭到惨败逃窜到土龙木省时，突然猛烈袭击土龙木省的油汀机场和美国侵略军进行“扫荡”的前线指挥部，一举打死打伤美国侵略者三百多名，击毁敌机十架、大炮两门和许多军用车辆。
    新华社河内三日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方边和省游击队，十一月十日机智地潜入边和省的春禄市镇，烧毁敌人储藏有十二万五千公升汽油的汽油库一座，和一架停放在仓库附近的直升飞机。
    据新华社河内二日电越南《人民军队报》最近发表评论指出，美国侵略军目前的所谓“旱季反攻”必将遭到比上一次“旱季反攻”更加惨重的失败。
    评论说，一年来美国向南方继续增派了二十万军队，但是，仍然感到它的军队不能满足战场上的要求。
    评论说，同去年旱季初期相比，解放武装力量主力部队已经飞跃地成长起来，游击战争从山区到平原，从农村到城市，普遍发展，迫使本来就分散的美国侵略军更加分散了。
    评论最后说，在越南南方各个战场上，美国侵略军正遭到连续的、沉重的失败。英勇的南方解放武装力量，正在紧紧地掌握着战场上的主动权，决心夺取更加巨大的胜利。（附图片）
