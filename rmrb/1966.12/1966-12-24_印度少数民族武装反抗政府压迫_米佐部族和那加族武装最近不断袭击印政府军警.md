Indian minority ethnic groups, including the Mizo tribe, Naga tribe, and Garo tribe, are continuously engaging in armed resistance against the oppression and suppression by the Congress Party government.

In the Mizo Hills district of Assam in eastern India, approximately 10,000 members of the Mizo tribe have been in armed rebellion since February 28 of this year. Despite the Indian reactionary government dispatching large numbers of troops to carry out bloody massacres and Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi personally leading the suppression efforts in Assam, the Mizo tribe has persisted in their armed struggle. According to recent reports from Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur, the Mizo armed forces have successfully controlled approximately 700 scattered villages and several military outposts.

The Mizo armed forces frequently strike back against the reactionary government's military. According to Indian newspapers, on the 16th, a group of Mizo armed forces engaged in fierce combat with the reactionary government's security forces near Kokrajhar, resulting in seven deaths and six missing from the security forces. On the 18th, 30 Mizo armed forces used automatic weapons to attack a patrol squad of the security forces in the Aizawl region. On the 20th, 40 Mizo armed forces attacked a patrol squad of the security forces in a location southeast of Aizawl. The Indian government has had to admit that since the armed rebellion began in February, the security situation in the Mizo Hills has been "very difficult."

The Naga tribe continues to resist the oppression of the Congress Party government through armed struggle. In mid-October, a group of Naga armed forces attacked a police barracks in a location under the direct administration of the central government in Manipur, seizing six rifles and a batch of ammunition before retreating into the dense forest.

On the 20th of this month, approximately 100 Naga armed forces, equipped with automatic weapons, ambushed an Assam Rifles patrol squad near Ukhrul in Manipur, killing two reactionary armed personnel and injuring one.

The Garo tribe in Assam has also risen up against the oppression of the Congress Party reactionary government. On the 23rd of last month, the deputy assistant police superintendent, along with a group of officials, went to the countryside in Goalpara district to accuse a large number of Garo tribe members of "occupying government land" and drove them off the land they were cultivating. Approximately 500 angry Garo tribe members rose up in resistance, and the police opened fire, brutally suppressing the crowd and killing three people. Currently, the armed struggle of Indian minority ethnic groups against the oppression of the reactionary government continues.

    印度少数民族武装反抗政府压迫
    米佐部族和那加族武装最近不断袭击印政府军警
    新华社二十三日讯新德里消息：印度米佐部族、那加族、加罗部族等少数民族，正在不断武装反抗国大党政府对他们的压迫和镇压。
    印度东部阿萨姆邦米佐山区县的米佐部族约一万人，自从今年二月二十八日举行武装暴动以来，尽管印度反动政府派遣大批军队进行血腥屠杀，印度总理英迪拉·甘地还亲自赶到阿萨姆邦指挥镇压，但米佐部族人一直坚持武装斗争。据德意志新闻社最近报道，米佐部族武装现在成功地控制着大约七百个分散的村庄和一些军事据点。
    米佐部族武装经常痛击反动政府的军队。据印度报纸报道，十六日，一支米佐部族武装在考库尔附近与反动政府的保安部队进行激烈战斗，保安部队有七名被打死，六名失踪。十八日，三十名米佐部族武装在艾贾尔地区用自动武器袭击了一支保安部队的巡逻队。二十日，四十名米佐部族武装在艾贾尔东南三十英里的一个地方袭击了一支保安部队的巡逻队。印度政府不得不承认：米佐山区从今年二月发生武装暴动以后的十个月来，“治安情况很困难”。
    那加族也继续以武装斗争反抗国大党政府的压迫。十月中旬，一支那加族武装在中央直辖的曼尼普尔邦一个地方袭击一所警察营房，夺取了六支步枪和一批弹药，然后，转入密林中。
    本月二十日，约一百名用自动武器装备的那加族武装，在曼尼普尔邦的乌克鲁尔附近伏击了一支阿萨姆步枪队的巡逻队，打死反动武装人员两名、打伤一名。
    阿萨姆邦的加罗部族也奋起反抗国大党反动政府的压迫。上月二十三日，戈阿尔帕拉县的助理副警察局长带着一群官员到乡下，以“侵占了政府土地”的罪名，把大批加罗部族人从他们耕种的土地上赶出去，约五百名愤怒的加罗部族人奋起反抗，警察开枪血腥镇压群众，打死了三人。目前，印度少数民族用武装来反对反动政府压迫的斗争仍在继续中。
