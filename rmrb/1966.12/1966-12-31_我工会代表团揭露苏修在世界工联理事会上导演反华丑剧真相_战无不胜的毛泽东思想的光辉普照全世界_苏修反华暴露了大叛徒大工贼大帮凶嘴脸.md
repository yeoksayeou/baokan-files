The Chinese trade union delegation attending the 16th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions recently reported to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, exposing the facts of how the great traitors of the world revolution, the Soviet revisionists, acting as the henchmen of U.S. imperialism, manipulated the meeting to stage an unprecedented anti-China farce in the history of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The summary of the report is as follows:

The World Federation of Trade Unions held its 16th Council Meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria, from December 6 to 9. Under the manipulation of the Soviet revisionists, the meeting passed anti-China resolutions that slandered the Chinese trade unions and interfered in their internal affairs, illegally depriving the Chinese trade union delegation of the right to attend the meeting, and staging an unprecedented anti-China farce in the history of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Soviet revisionists' anti-China and splitist actions in the international trade union movement were resolutely countered by the Chinese trade union delegation, which hoisted the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and were condemned and opposed by all representatives who uphold truth and justice.

The Soviet revisionist leadership, fearing the great influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is hastening to ally with U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries to launch a frenzied anti-China campaign. The serious anti-China incident at this meeting is part of the current new wave of anti-China sentiment, meticulously planned and personally directed by the leaders of the Soviet trade unions.

Before this meeting, Soviet trade union leader Grishin frequently met with leaders of some foreign trade unions, issuing joint anti-China statements and anti-China speeches, plotting to launch an anti-China campaign at the council meeting. At the executive bureau and executive committee meetings held on the eve of the council meeting, Grishin and his followers viciously attacked China. The Chinese representatives engaged in a tit-for-tat struggle with the Soviet revisionists, exposing their betrayal.

On the first day of the council meeting, when the Chinese and Albanian trade union representatives exposed the Soviet revisionists' collusion with the Yugoslav traitors and the illegal inclusion of the Tito clique's trade union leaders in the meeting, the Soviet revisionists immediately manipulated the meeting to forcibly pass a regulation in the rules of procedure that anyone opposing Soviet revisionism would be deprived of their right to speak. It was clear that the purpose of this regulation was to allow only the promotion of the Soviet-American cooperation line to dominate the world at the meeting, while not allowing anyone to expose the betrayal of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The essence of Marxism-Leninism is to rebel. Based on this, we rebel, we struggle, and we build socialism." We must resolutely rebel against U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and all reactionaries.

On the 7th, we spoke on the first item of the agenda, speaking for only a few minutes, when the presiding chairman accused us of "anti-Soviet" for exposing Soviet revisionism, obstructing and interfering with our speech. The Chinese representatives, loyal to the proletarian standpoint, naturally would not heed the will of the Soviet revisionists and insisted on continuing to speak. The presiding chairman then, on the pretext of violating the rules of procedure, illegally deprived the Chinese representatives of their right to speak and turned off the microphone. We firmly defended our right to speak, denouncing this undemocratic act, and asking the Soviet revisionists: Since your foreign minister is secretly trading in the White House; since Moscow is bustling with activity, pushing the "peace talks" fraud for U.S. imperialism in the Vietnam issue; since you are promoting "d√©tente" in Europe, helping U.S. imperialism's strategic eastward shift, increasing troops in South Vietnam, how can we not expose you? At this, the revisionists were in a panic, not knowing what to do, shouting that the Chinese representatives had taken Red Guard actions. Subsequently, the presiding chairman even unreasonably announced the suspension of that day's meeting.

The Soviet revisionists, failing in one scheme, applied new pressure. That night, they instructed the chairman of the Bulgarian trade unions, Durlof, to meet with the Chinese delegation, threatening and deceiving them, attempting to make the Chinese representatives abandon their principled stance against imperialism and revisionism, even shamelessly saying, "The Soviet Union and Bulgaria are in a mother-child relationship," and "we cannot allow attacks on the Soviet Union." We sternly refuted this and pointed out, "Your speech drafts must be sent to Grishin for review, that is your business. The speeches of the Chinese representatives can only express the stance of the Chinese working class, and anyone who tries to make us change our stance will never succeed."

On the morning of the 8th, after the meeting resumed, we firmly demanded to continue the speech interrupted on the 7th, but were again unreasonably rejected by the presiding chairman. Later, we spoke on the second item of the agenda, exposing the Soviet revisionists' refusal to fully amend the World Federation of Trade Unions charter. The presiding chairman of the meeting again openly took the malicious action of adjourning the meeting, interrupting our speech. After nearly two hours of backstage plotting, the Soviet revisionists finally played their last card to expel the Chinese delegation. After the meeting resumed, the general secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Louis Saillant, presented a draft decision from the presidium to the assembly. This decision, with all sorts of absurd reasons, claimed that the Chinese representatives had "repeatedly violated the rules of procedure," that the members of the Chinese delegation, except for Han Xiya, "were not council members or alternate members," and that the "situation of the Chinese trade unions was unclear," attempting to deprive the Chinese delegation of the right to attend the 16th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

Regarding the anti-China provocation and splitist actions against the Chinese working class created by the Soviet revisionists, we immediately went to the podium to issue a strong protest statement, refuting point by point the illegal anti-China decision. Under our righteous refutation, the Soviet trade union leaders and their followers were at a loss, unable to sit still.

The anti-China incident deliberately created by the Soviet revisionists aroused strong opposition from many representatives. The Albanian representative immediately went to the podium to speak, condemning the despicable actions of the Soviet revisionists. At this, the Soviet revisionists ordered their lackeys to go to the podium, collide with the Albanian representative, and even sent unidentified individuals to use violence, pushing the Albanian representative off the podium. When the Chinese representative stepped forward to stop this violence, the burly men previously arranged around the Chinese delegation surged forward, colliding with the Chinese and Albanian representatives. At this, the entire venue was in uproar, and the fascist face of the Soviet revisionists was fully exposed. The Albanian representative firmly protested the savage actions of the Soviet revisionists, withdrew from the venue, and issued a written statement.

The representatives of Vietnam, South Vietnam, Indonesia, Ceylon, North Korea, Romania, Cuba, Japan, and others expressed their opposition to the absurd decision of the World Federation of Trade Unions. Many representatives from Venezuela and other countries did not participate in the vote. Some Bulgarian workers, upon hearing this news, specially came to pay their respects to the Chinese representatives, angrily condemning the Soviet revisionists. A foreign representative indignantly said, "On the eve of World War II, in the court trying the Reichstag fire case under Hitler's fascism, the great international communist fighter Dimitrov was still allowed to speak and expose fascism, but today, on the podium of the World Federation of Trade Unions meeting, representatives are not allowed to freely express their opinions. The arrogance of this is even more extreme than that of the fascists at that time." This remark is a perfect portrayal of the Soviet revisionists.

Here, we once again express our heartfelt thanks and respect to the trade union delegations from various countries that supported the legitimate rights of the Chinese delegation at the meeting.

In recent years, there has been a sharp struggle between two lines within the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Soviet revisionists have abandoned the traditional anti-imperialist, class struggle line of the World Federation of Trade Unions and imposed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of class capitulation on the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Chinese trade unions have fought resolutely against this, and they have always regarded the Chinese trade unions, which insist on the proletarian revolutionary line, as a thorn in their side and the biggest obstacle to the implementation of the line of class capitulation in the international trade union movement.

The Soviet revisionists attempted to use this meeting to further promote their policy of completely capitulating to U.S. imperialism and completely betraying the interests of the working class. In the general report, conclusions, and resolutions forcibly passed at the meeting under the manipulation of the Soviet revisionists, this can be clearly seen.

They claimed that the meeting was centered on supporting Vietnam, but the general report of the meeting vigorously advocated "ceasefire" and "peaceful resolution" of the Vietnam issue, in line with the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" conspiracy. The meeting also specially passed a resolution on European security, advocating "d√©tente" in the European situation, in line with the U.S. imperialists' strategic shift eastward and the increase of troops in South Vietnam. The Soviet revisionists also instructed the general secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions to brazenly attack the Vietnamese representatives at the meeting, saying that the Vietnamese trade unions did not agree to hold a meeting to support Vietnam according to their capitulationist line, which could only be beneficial to U.S. imperialism. This is a great insult to the Vietnamese people who are fighting to the death against U.S. imperialism.

On the issue of workers' struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, they did not mention supporting the struggles of workers in countries striving for independence, and did not mention supporting the armed struggles of the peoples of these countries. For the struggles of workers in already independent countries, they only talked about economic development and did not mention opposing imperialist aggression and infiltration. They attempted to fundamentally eliminate the anti-imperialist struggles of Asian, African, and Latin American workers.

On the issue of workers' struggles in capitalist countries, they vigorously whitewashed the monopoly capitalist groups and peddled the already bankrupt "peaceful transition" fallacy.

They also vigorously advocated the "new economic system" of the Soviet Union, which is accelerating the restoration of capitalism, and the "material incentive principle" that poisons workers.

They also vigorously advocated for "joint action" with the leadership of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the agents of U.S. imperialism in the international trade union movement, begging for "unification in a large organization." They also, despite the opposition of many representatives, forcibly brought in the trade union leaders of the Yugoslav Tito clique of traitors to participate in the meeting. Truly, birds of a feather flock together.

All this shows that the Soviet revisionists are using this meeting to fully accelerate the implementation of their line of cooperation with U.S. imperialism, maintaining the rule of imperialism and colonialism in the capitalist world, and restoring capitalism in the socialist world. Their increasingly brazen betrayal has been resolutely exposed by the Chinese representatives. Thus, they, with their knives drawn, took the ruthless action of expelling the Chinese delegation.

The anti-China farce staged at the 16th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions is another great exposure of the Soviet revisionists, making the workers of the world further see that the Soviet revisionist leadership is the great traitor of the world revolution, the great scab in the international workers' movement, and the great henchman of U.S. imperialism. They are hastening to carry out their evil schemes of aligning with the United States, opposing China, opposing communism, opposing the people, and opposing revolution. The workers of the world, in order to overthrow U.S. imperialism and for the victory of the cause of workers' liberation, must resolutely fight against the modern revisionist group centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership and absolutely not engage in any "joint action" with them. The workers of the world will surely throw this handful of traitors and scabs into the dustbin of history.

From this anti-China farce, the workers of the world can further see that the Soviet revisionist leadership is becoming more and more untenable. They have already had to tear off the veil of false democracy and turn to the fascist and barbaric methods of depriving the right to speak, using violence, and expelling from the meeting. Chairman Mao said: "Open exposure replaces concealment and cover-up, which is the manifestation of imperialism going off the rails." Now, the Soviet revisionist leadership is also going off the rails, precisely showing their extreme weakness, showing their desperate situation, and indicating that they are hastening to their own grave.

From this anti-China farce, the workers of the world can further see the essence of the Soviet revisionist leadership's fear of truth and fear of the people. They appear bold on the surface but are actually cowardly, unable to bear the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought and the voices of revolutionary people. They want to expel the Chinese trade union delegation from the meeting precisely because they fear that we will spread Mao Zedong Thought at the meeting and fear that we will expose their traitorous deeds. The Soviet revisionists can expel us from the meeting, but they can never block the spread of Mao Zedong Thought among the workers of the world. The invincible light of Mao Zedong Thought will surely illuminate the globe, guiding the workers and peoples of the world to sweep away all harmful creatures and achieve the victory of the world revolution.

We are convinced that the workers of the world will draw lessons from this anti-China farce staged at the meeting, further recognize the unshakable truth that anti-imperialism must be anti-revisionism and that alignment with the United States necessarily means opposition to China, further strengthen the unity of their ranks on the proletarian standpoint, unite with all oppressed nations and peoples in the world, and carry on the struggle against imperialism led by the United States to the end, and carry on the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership to the end, striving for new and even greater victories in the cause of the liberation of the international working class.

From this sharp struggle with the Soviet revisionists, we vividly and concretely saw the panic of the Soviet revisionists in the face of the great Mao Zedong Thought and China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and we also deeply felt that Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. Revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will surely be invincible. We must follow the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and implement it in all actions. We must carry forward the spirit of revolutionary rebellion, actively throw ourselves into the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and into the surging storm of the world revolution, forever be the vanguard fighters, and dedicate everything to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution!

Our great leader Chairman Mao calls on us, "All Marxist-Leninists of the world, unite! All revolutionary peoples of the world, unite! Overthrow imperialism, overthrow modern revisionism, overthrow all reactionaries. A new world without imperialism, without capitalism, without exploitation, will definitely be established." The Chinese workers will, together with the workers and peoples of the world, resolutely fight for the realization of this great goal!
