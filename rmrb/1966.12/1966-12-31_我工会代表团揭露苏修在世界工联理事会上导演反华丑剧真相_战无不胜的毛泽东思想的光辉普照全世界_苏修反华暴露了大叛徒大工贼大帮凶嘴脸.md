The Chinese trade union delegation attending the 16th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions recently reported to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, exposing the facts of how the great traitors of the world revolution, the Soviet revisionists, acting as the henchmen of U.S. imperialism, manipulated the meeting to stage an unprecedented anti-China farce in the history of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The summary of the report is as follows:

The World Federation of Trade Unions held its 16th Council Meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria, from December 6 to 9. Under the manipulation of the Soviet revisionists, the meeting passed anti-China resolutions that slandered the Chinese trade unions and interfered in their internal affairs, illegally depriving the Chinese trade union delegation of the right to attend the meeting, and staging an unprecedented anti-China farce in the history of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Soviet revisionists' anti-China and splitist actions in the international trade union movement were resolutely countered by the Chinese trade union delegation, which hoisted the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and were condemned and opposed by all representatives who uphold truth and justice.

The Soviet revisionist leadership, fearing the great influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is hastening to ally with U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries to launch a frenzied anti-China campaign. The serious anti-China incident at this meeting is part of the current new wave of anti-China sentiment, meticulously planned and personally directed by the leaders of the Soviet trade unions.

Before this meeting, Soviet trade union leader Grishin frequently met with leaders of some foreign trade unions, issuing joint anti-China statements and anti-China speeches, plotting to launch an anti-China campaign at the council meeting. At the executive bureau and executive committee meetings held on the eve of the council meeting, Grishin and his followers viciously attacked China. The Chinese representatives engaged in a tit-for-tat struggle with the Soviet revisionists, exposing their betrayal.

On the first day of the council meeting, when the Chinese and Albanian trade union representatives exposed the Soviet revisionists' collusion with the Yugoslav traitors and the illegal inclusion of the Tito clique's trade union leaders in the meeting, the Soviet revisionists immediately manipulated the meeting to forcibly pass a regulation in the rules of procedure that anyone opposing Soviet revisionism would be deprived of their right to speak. It was clear that the purpose of this regulation was to allow only the promotion of the Soviet-American cooperation line to dominate the world at the meeting, while not allowing anyone to expose the betrayal of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The essence of Marxism-Leninism is to rebel. Based on this, we rebel, we struggle, and we build socialism." We must resolutely rebel against U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and all reactionaries.

On the 7th, we spoke on the first item of the agenda, speaking for only a few minutes, when the presiding chairman accused us of "anti-Soviet" for exposing Soviet revisionism, obstructing and interfering with our speech. The Chinese representatives, loyal to the proletarian standpoint, naturally would not heed the will of the Soviet revisionists and insisted on continuing to speak. The presiding chairman then, on the pretext of violating the rules of procedure, illegally deprived the Chinese representatives of their right to speak and turned off the microphone. We firmly defended our right to speak, denouncing this undemocratic act, and asking the Soviet revisionists: Since your foreign minister is secretly trading in the White House; since Moscow is bustling with activity, pushing the "peace talks" fraud for U.S. imperialism in the Vietnam issue; since you are promoting "détente" in Europe, helping U.S. imperialism's strategic eastward shift, increasing troops in South Vietnam, how can we not expose you? At this, the revisionists were in a panic, not knowing what to do, shouting that the Chinese representatives had taken Red Guard actions. Subsequently, the presiding chairman even unreasonably announced the suspension of that day's meeting.

The Soviet revisionists, failing in one scheme, applied new pressure. That night, they instructed the chairman of the Bulgarian trade unions, Durlof, to meet with the Chinese delegation, threatening and deceiving them, attempting to make the Chinese representatives abandon their principled stance against imperialism and revisionism, even shamelessly saying, "The Soviet Union and Bulgaria are in a mother-child relationship," and "we cannot allow attacks on the Soviet Union." We sternly refuted this and pointed out, "Your speech drafts must be sent to Grishin for review, that is your business. The speeches of the Chinese representatives can only express the stance of the Chinese working class, and anyone who tries to make us change our stance will never succeed."

On the morning of the 8th, after the meeting resumed, we firmly demanded to continue the speech interrupted on the 7th, but were again unreasonably rejected by the presiding chairman. Later, we spoke on the second item of the agenda, exposing the Soviet revisionists' refusal to fully amend the World Federation of Trade Unions charter. The presiding chairman of the meeting again openly took the malicious action of adjourning the meeting, interrupting our speech. After nearly two hours of backstage plotting, the Soviet revisionists finally played their last card to expel the Chinese delegation. After the meeting resumed, the general secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Louis Saillant, presented a draft decision from the presidium to the assembly. This decision, with all sorts of absurd reasons, claimed that the Chinese representatives had "repeatedly violated the rules of procedure," that the members of the Chinese delegation, except for Han Xiya, "were not council members or alternate members," and that the "situation of the Chinese trade unions was unclear," attempting to deprive the Chinese delegation of the right to attend the 16th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

Regarding the anti-China provocation and splitist actions against the Chinese working class created by the Soviet revisionists, we immediately went to the podium to issue a strong protest statement, refuting point by point the illegal anti-China decision. Under our righteous refutation, the Soviet trade union leaders and their followers were at a loss, unable to sit still.

The anti-China incident deliberately created by the Soviet revisionists aroused strong opposition from many representatives. The Albanian representative immediately went to the podium to speak, condemning the despicable actions of the Soviet revisionists. At this, the Soviet revisionists ordered their lackeys to go to the podium, collide with the Albanian representative, and even sent unidentified individuals to use violence, pushing the Albanian representative off the podium. When the Chinese representative stepped forward to stop this violence, the burly men previously arranged around the Chinese delegation surged forward, colliding with the Chinese and Albanian representatives. At this, the entire venue was in uproar, and the fascist face of the Soviet revisionists was fully exposed. The Albanian representative firmly protested the savage actions of the Soviet revisionists, withdrew from the venue, and issued a written statement.

The representatives of Vietnam, South Vietnam, Indonesia, Ceylon, North Korea, Romania, Cuba, Japan, and others expressed their opposition to the absurd decision of the World Federation of Trade Unions. Many representatives from Venezuela and other countries did not participate in the vote. Some Bulgarian workers, upon hearing this news, specially came to pay their respects to the Chinese representatives, angrily condemning the Soviet revisionists. A foreign representative indignantly said, "On the eve of World War II, in the court trying the Reichstag fire case under Hitler's fascism, the great international communist fighter Dimitrov was still allowed to speak and expose fascism, but today, on the podium of the World Federation of Trade Unions meeting, representatives are not allowed to freely express their opinions. The arrogance of this is even more extreme than that of the fascists at that time." This remark is a perfect portrayal of the Soviet revisionists.

Here, we once again express our heartfelt thanks and respect to the trade union delegations from various countries that supported the legitimate rights of the Chinese delegation at the meeting.

In recent years, there has been a sharp struggle between two lines within the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Soviet revisionists have abandoned the traditional anti-imperialist, class struggle line of the World Federation of Trade Unions and imposed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of class capitulation on the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Chinese trade unions have fought resolutely against this, and they have always regarded the Chinese trade unions, which insist on the proletarian revolutionary line, as a thorn in their side and the biggest obstacle to the implementation of the line of class capitulation in the international trade union movement.

The Soviet revisionists attempted to use this meeting to further promote their policy of completely capitulating to U.S. imperialism and completely betraying the interests of the working class. In the general report, conclusions, and resolutions forcibly passed at the meeting under the manipulation of the Soviet revisionists, this can be clearly seen.

They claimed that the meeting was centered on supporting Vietnam, but the general report of the meeting vigorously advocated "ceasefire" and "peaceful resolution" of the Vietnam issue, in line with the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" conspiracy. The meeting also specially passed a resolution on European security, advocating "détente" in the European situation, in line with the U.S. imperialists' strategic shift eastward and the increase of troops in South Vietnam. The Soviet revisionists also instructed the general secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions to brazenly attack the Vietnamese representatives at the meeting, saying that the Vietnamese trade unions did not agree to hold a meeting to support Vietnam according to their capitulationist line, which could only be beneficial to U.S. imperialism. This is a great insult to the Vietnamese people who are fighting to the death against U.S. imperialism.

On the issue of workers' struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, they did not mention supporting the struggles of workers in countries striving for independence, and did not mention supporting the armed struggles of the peoples of these countries. For the struggles of workers in already independent countries, they only talked about economic development and did not mention opposing imperialist aggression and infiltration. They attempted to fundamentally eliminate the anti-imperialist struggles of Asian, African, and Latin American workers.

On the issue of workers' struggles in capitalist countries, they vigorously whitewashed the monopoly capitalist groups and peddled the already bankrupt "peaceful transition" fallacy.

They also vigorously advocated the "new economic system" of the Soviet Union, which is accelerating the restoration of capitalism, and the "material incentive principle" that poisons workers.

They also vigorously advocated for "joint action" with the leadership of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the agents of U.S. imperialism in the international trade union movement, begging for "unification in a large organization." They also, despite the opposition of many representatives, forcibly brought in the trade union leaders of the Yugoslav Tito clique of traitors to participate in the meeting. Truly, birds of a feather flock together.

All this shows that the Soviet revisionists are using this meeting to fully accelerate the implementation of their line of cooperation with U.S. imperialism, maintaining the rule of imperialism and colonialism in the capitalist world, and restoring capitalism in the socialist world. Their increasingly brazen betrayal has been resolutely exposed by the Chinese representatives. Thus, they, with their knives drawn, took the ruthless action of expelling the Chinese delegation.

The anti-China farce staged at the 16th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions is another great exposure of the Soviet revisionists, making the workers of the world further see that the Soviet revisionist leadership is the great traitor of the world revolution, the great scab in the international workers' movement, and the great henchman of U.S. imperialism. They are hastening to carry out their evil schemes of aligning with the United States, opposing China, opposing communism, opposing the people, and opposing revolution. The workers of the world, in order to overthrow U.S. imperialism and for the victory of the cause of workers' liberation, must resolutely fight against the modern revisionist group centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership and absolutely not engage in any "joint action" with them. The workers of the world will surely throw this handful of traitors and scabs into the dustbin of history.

From this anti-China farce, the workers of the world can further see that the Soviet revisionist leadership is becoming more and more untenable. They have already had to tear off the veil of false democracy and turn to the fascist and barbaric methods of depriving the right to speak, using violence, and expelling from the meeting. Chairman Mao said: "Open exposure replaces concealment and cover-up, which is the manifestation of imperialism going off the rails." Now, the Soviet revisionist leadership is also going off the rails, precisely showing their extreme weakness, showing their desperate situation, and indicating that they are hastening to their own grave.

From this anti-China farce, the workers of the world can further see the essence of the Soviet revisionist leadership's fear of truth and fear of the people. They appear bold on the surface but are actually cowardly, unable to bear the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought and the voices of revolutionary people. They want to expel the Chinese trade union delegation from the meeting precisely because they fear that we will spread Mao Zedong Thought at the meeting and fear that we will expose their traitorous deeds. The Soviet revisionists can expel us from the meeting, but they can never block the spread of Mao Zedong Thought among the workers of the world. The invincible light of Mao Zedong Thought will surely illuminate the globe, guiding the workers and peoples of the world to sweep away all harmful creatures and achieve the victory of the world revolution.

We are convinced that the workers of the world will draw lessons from this anti-China farce staged at the meeting, further recognize the unshakable truth that anti-imperialism must be anti-revisionism and that alignment with the United States necessarily means opposition to China, further strengthen the unity of their ranks on the proletarian standpoint, unite with all oppressed nations and peoples in the world, and carry on the struggle against imperialism led by the United States to the end, and carry on the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership to the end, striving for new and even greater victories in the cause of the liberation of the international working class.

From this sharp struggle with the Soviet revisionists, we vividly and concretely saw the panic of the Soviet revisionists in the face of the great Mao Zedong Thought and China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and we also deeply felt that Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. Revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will surely be invincible. We must follow the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and implement it in all actions. We must carry forward the spirit of revolutionary rebellion, actively throw ourselves into the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and into the surging storm of the world revolution, forever be the vanguard fighters, and dedicate everything to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution!

Our great leader Chairman Mao calls on us, "All Marxist-Leninists of the world, unite! All revolutionary peoples of the world, unite! Overthrow imperialism, overthrow modern revisionism, overthrow all reactionaries. A new world without imperialism, without capitalism, without exploitation, will definitely be established." The Chinese workers will, together with the workers and peoples of the world, resolutely fight for the realization of this great goal!

    我工会代表团揭露苏修在世界工联理事会上导演反华丑剧真相
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉普照全世界
    苏修反华暴露了大叛徒大工贼大帮凶嘴脸
    据新华社三十日讯　出席世界工联第十六次理事会会议的中国工会代表团，最近向中华全国总工会报告，揭露世界革命的大叛徒苏联修正主义者，充当美帝国主义的大帮凶，一手操纵这次会议，演出了一场世界工联历史上空前未有的反华大丑剧的事实真相。
    报告摘要如下：
    世界工会联合会于十二月六日至九日在保加利亚首都索非亚举行了第十六次理事会会议。这次会议在苏联修正主义者的操纵下，竟然通过了污蔑中国工会、干涉中国工会内部事务的反华决定，非法剥夺中国工会代表团出席会议的权利，演出了一场世界工联历史上空前未有的反华大丑剧。苏联修正主义者这种反华和分裂国际工会运动的罪恶行动，遭到了高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中国工会代表团的坚决反击，也遭到一切维护真理、主持正义的代表的谴责和反对。
    苏联修正主义领导集团慑于我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大影响，正在加紧联合美帝国主义和一切反动派，掀起反华的歇斯底里。这次会议上发生的严重反华事件，正是当前新的反华浪潮的一个组成部分，是由苏联工会领导人精心策划和亲自指挥的。
    在这次会议以前，苏联工会领导人格里申就和一些外国工会的领导人频繁会晤，连续发表了反华联合声明和反华言论，策划在理事会会议上反华。在理事会会议前夕举行的执行局和执行委员会会议上，格里申及其追随者恶毒地攻击中国。中国代表同苏联修正主义者进行了针锋相对斗争，狠揭了他们的叛卖行为。
    理事会会议开幕的第一天，当中国和阿尔巴尼亚工会代表揭露了苏联修正主义者同南斯拉夫叛徒勾搭，硬把铁托集团的工会领导人拉进会议的罪行以后，苏联修正主义者立即操纵会议，强行通过了在议事规则中增加谁要反对苏联修正主义，就剥夺谁的发言权的规定。十分明显，这个规定的目的是只准在会议上宣扬苏美合作主宰世界路线，而不准人们去揭露苏联修正主义领导集团的叛卖行为。
    毛主席教导我们：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’……根据这个道理，于是就反抗，就斗争，就干社会主义。”我们就是要大造美帝国主义的反，大造苏联修正主义的反，大造一切反动派的反。
    七日，我们就会议的第一项议程发言，仅仅讲了几分钟，执行主席就诬蔑我们揭露苏联修正主义是所谓“反苏”，阻挠和干涉我们的发言。忠于无产阶级立场的中国代表当然不会听从苏联修正主义的意志，坚持继续发言。执行主席即以违反议事规则为借口，开动表决机器，非法剥夺了中国代表的发言权，并且关闭了扩音器。我们坚决维护自己的发言权利，痛斥这种反民主的丑行，责问苏联修正主义者：既然你们的外交部长进出白宫进行秘密交易；既然莫斯科门庭若市，在越南问题上为美帝国主义推销“和谈”骗局；既然你们在欧洲大搞“和缓”，帮助美帝战略东移，增兵南越，难道还能指望我们不揭露吗？这时修正主义者慌作一团，不知所措，惊呼中国代表采取了红卫兵行动。随后，执行主席竟然无理宣布中止这一天的会议。
      苏联修正主义者一计不成，又施加新的压力。当天晚上，就指使保加利亚工会主席久洛夫会见中国代表团，进行威胁诱骗，妄图要中国代表放弃反对帝国主义和修正主义的严正立场，甚至恬不知耻地说什么“苏联和保加利亚是母子关系”，“不能允许对苏联的攻击”。我们在严词驳斥后指出，“你们的发言稿必须送请格里申审查，那是你们的事，中国代表的发言，只能阐明中国工人阶级的立场，任何人妄图要我们改变立场，那是永远也办不到的”。
    八日上午开会后，我们坚决要求继续七日被中断的发言，但再次遭到执行主席的无理拒绝。后来，我们又就会议第二项议程发言，揭露苏联修正主义者拒绝全面修改世界工联章程。会议的执行主席又公然采取休会的恶劣手段，中断我们的发言。苏联修正主义者在经过近两个小时的幕后策划后，终于打出了赶走中国代表团的最后一张牌。在复会以后，由世界工联总书记路易·赛扬出面，向大会提出了一个主席团的所谓决定草案。这个决定以种种荒谬透顶的理由，说什么中国代表“一再违反议事规则”，中国代表团的成员除韩西雅一人以外，“都不是理事和候补理事”，“中国工会情况不明”等等，企图剥夺中国代表团出席世界工联第十六次理事会会议的权利。
    对于苏联修正主义者制造的这种对中国工人阶级严重政治挑衅和分裂国际工会运动的行动，我们立即上台发表强烈的抗议声明，逐点驳斥了这个非法的反华决定。在我们义正词严的驳斥下，苏联工会领导人及其追随者面面相觑，坐立不安。
    苏联修正主义者蓄意制造的反华事件，激起了许多代表的强烈反对。阿尔巴尼亚代表随即登台发言，谴责苏联修正主义者的卑鄙行径。这时，苏联修正主义者就指挥他们的娄罗上台，冲撞阿尔巴尼亚代表，甚至派遣不明身份的人使用暴力，把阿尔巴尼亚代表推下讲台。当中国代表上前阻止这种暴行时，事先安排在中国代表团周围的彪形大汉蜂涌而出，冲撞中国和阿尔巴尼亚代表。这时全场哗然，苏联修正主义者的法西斯面目暴露无遗。阿尔巴尼亚代表坚决抗议苏联修正主义者的野蛮行径，退出会场，并发表书面声明。
    越南、越南南方、印度尼西亚、锡兰、朝鲜、罗马尼亚、古巴、日本等代表团都表示反对世界工联这个荒谬的决定。委内瑞拉等不少代表团不参加投票。一些保加利亚工人知道这个消息后，专门前来找中国代表致敬，愤怒谴责苏联修正主义。一位外国代表还愤愤不平地说，第二次世界大战前夕，在希特勒法西斯审讯国会纵火案的法庭上，还允许伟大的国际共产主义战士季米特洛夫讲话揭露法西斯，而在今天的世界工联会议讲坛上，竟然不允许代表们自由发表自己的意见，其专横的程度比当年的法西斯还有过之而无不及。这段话是给苏联修正主义的一幅绝妙的写照。
    在这里，我们再一次向在会议上支持中国代表团合法权利的各国工会代表团致以衷心的感谢和敬意。
    几年来，世界工联内部一直存在着尖锐的两条路线斗争。苏联修正主义者背弃了世界工联传统的反帝、阶级斗争路线，把反革命修正主义的阶级投降路线强加于世界工联。中国工会对此进行了坚决的斗争，他们就一直把坚持无产阶级革命路线的中国工会看作是眼中钉，看作是在国际工会运动中推行阶级投降路线的最大障碍。
    苏联修正主义者力图利用这次会议进一步推行彻底投靠美帝国主义、彻底出卖工人阶级利益的政策，在苏联修正主义者策划下炮制出来的会议总报告、结论和强行通过的决议中，可以清楚地看到这一点。
    他们标榜会议以支援越南为中心，可是会议的总报告却大肆鼓吹“停火”、“和平解决”越南问题，来配合美帝国主义搞“和谈”阴谋。会议还专门通过了欧洲安全的决议，鼓吹“和缓”欧洲局势，配合美帝国主义战略重点东移，增兵南越。苏联修正主义者还指使世界工联总书记在会上放肆地攻击越南代表，说什么越南工会不同意按他们的投降主义路线召开支援越南会议，只能对美帝国主义有利。这是对正在同美帝国主义浴血奋战的越南人民的极大污辱。
    他们在亚非拉国家工人斗争问题上，不讲支持正在争取独立的国家的工人的斗争，绝口不提支持这些国家人民的武装斗争。对已经独立国家的工人斗争，也只讲发展经济，不讲反对帝国主义的侵略和渗透。他们妄图从根本上取消亚非拉工人的反帝斗争。
    他们在资本主义国家工人斗争问题上，极力为垄断资本集团擦脂抹粉，贩卖早已破产的“和平过渡”谬论。
    他们还大肆鼓吹为加速资本主义复辟的苏联“新经济体制”，鼓吹毒害工人的“物质刺激原则”。
    他们还极力鼓吹同美帝国主义在国际工会运动中的代理人——国际自由工联领导集团搞“联合行动”，乞求“统一在一个大组织中”。他们还不顾许多代表的反对，硬把南斯拉夫铁托叛徒集团的工会领导人拉来参加会议。真是人以群分，物以类聚。
    这些都说明了苏联修正主义利用这次会议，全面地加速推行同美帝国主义合作、在资本主义世界维护帝国主义和殖民主义的统治、在社会主义世界实行资本主义复辟的路线。他们这种变本加厉的叛卖行径，遭到中国代表的坚决揭露。于是他们图穷匕首现，卑鄙地采取了赶走中国代表团的蛮横行动。
    世界工联第十六次理事会会议演出的反华大丑剧，是苏联修正主义的又一次大暴露，使全世界工人进一步看清苏联修正主义领导集团是世界革命的大叛徒，是国际工人运动的大工贼，是美帝国主义的大帮凶。他们正在加紧进行联美、反华、反共、反人民、反革命的罪恶勾当。全世界工人为了打倒美帝国主义，为了工人阶级解放事业的胜利，就必须同以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义集团进行坚决的斗争，而决不能同他们搞什么“联合行动”。全世界工人必将把这一小撮叛徒和工贼扔进历史的垃圾堆。
    从这场反华丑剧中，全世界工人也可以进一步看到苏联修正主义领导集团是越来越混不下去了。他们已经不得不撕下假民主的遮羞布，转而采取剥夺发言、使用暴力以至赶出会议的法西斯野蛮手段。毛主席说：“公开暴露代替了遮藏掩盖，这就是帝国主义脱
  出常轨的表现。”现在，苏联修正主义领导集团也这样脱出常规，正是表现了他们的极端虚弱，表现了他们的穷途末路，表明他们正在加速滚向自己挖掘的坟墓。
      从这场反华丑剧中，全世界工人还进一步看到苏联修正主义领导集团害怕真理、害怕人民的本质。他们表面上气壮如牛，实际上胆小如鼠，见不得毛泽东思想的阳光，听不得革命人民的声音。他们之所以要把中国工会代表团赶出会议，就是因为害怕我们在会上传播毛泽东思想，害怕我们揭露他们的叛徒行径。苏联修正主义者尽管可以把我们赶出会议，但是绝对阻挡不了毛泽东思想在全世界工人中的传播。战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光芒，必将普照全球，引导全世界工人和人民，横扫一切害人虫，赢得世界革命的胜利。
    我们深信，全世界工人必将从这次会议演出的反华丑剧中吸取教益，进一步认识到反帝必须反修、联美必然反华这个颠扑不破的真理，进一步加强自己的队伍在无产阶级立场上的团结，联合世界上一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民，把反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争进行到底，把反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底，争取国际工人阶级解放事业新的更加伟大的胜利。
    从这一场同苏联修正主义者的尖锐斗争中，我们生动具体地看到了苏联修正主义者在伟大的毛泽东思想和我国无产阶级文化大革命面前的惊惶万状，也更加深刻体会到毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的最强大的思想武器。革命的人民掌握了毛泽东思想，就一定攻无不克，战无不胜。我们一定要遵照林彪同志的指示，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，真正把毛泽东思想学到手，落实到一切行动中去。我们一定要发扬革命造反精神，积极投身到火热的无产阶级文化大革命的洪流中去，投身到蓬勃兴起的世界革命的风暴中去，永远充当冲锋陷阵的战士，为中国革命和世界革命贡献自己的一切。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席号召我们，“全世界马克思列宁主义者团结起来，全世界革命人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派。一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界，一定要建立起来。”中国工人将坚定不移地同全世界工人和人民一起，为着实现这个伟大的目标而英勇奋战！
