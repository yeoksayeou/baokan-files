	Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: Nguyen Minh Hoang, acting head of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, held a grand reception tonight to warmly celebrate the sixth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

	Party and state leaders Zhou Enlai, Tao Zhu, Kang Sheng, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Liu Ningyi, Guo Moruo, and others were invited to attend the reception.

	Nguyen Minh Hoang, acting head of the delegation, and Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the reception. Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized that the 700 million Chinese people, who stand firmly with the Vietnamese people, are always watching the developments in Vietnam, remembering their internationalist duties, and are determined to provide the greatest support to the Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

	The reception was held at the Beijing Hotel. The reception hall was filled with a strong atmosphere of solidarity between the peoples of China and Vietnam. People enthusiastically celebrated the brilliant victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation through the great people's war.

	Nguyen Minh Hoang introduced the brilliant victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and severely condemned the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi. He pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' new "escalation" of the war aims to force the people of South Vietnam to accept the U.S. imperialists' so-called "peace talks" trick. However, the military and civilians of South Vietnam will not relax their vigilance and are determined to punish the enemy fivefold, tenfold, and to fight to the end, until the U.S. imperialists' aggression plots are thoroughly smashed, to liberate the South, defend the North, and reunify the country.

	He said that U.S. imperialism is the biggest enemy of all peoples in the world today. Out of a sense of responsibility to the country and duty to the peoples of the world, the people of South Vietnam are willing to take on the task of the frontline in the struggle against the U.S. and are determined to defeat the U.S. imperialists' aggression in South Vietnam, making a contribution to the struggle of the peoples of all countries for independence, peace, democracy, and social progress.

	He said that China and Vietnam are comrades in the same trench against the U.S. The Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people have provided invaluable support to the people of South Vietnam in both spirit and material. The people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam express their profound gratitude to Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people for their immense and effective support.

	After discussing the mutual support and encouragement between the people of South Vietnam and the peoples of the world in the struggle against the U.S., Nguyen Minh Hoang said that the people of South Vietnam are confident that with the strength of national unity, the will to fight resolutely, under the wise leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the united efforts of the northern compatriots, and the sympathy and support of the Chinese people and the peoples of the world, the people of South Vietnam will surely achieve final victory.

	Vice Premier Chen Yi, in his speech, warmly praised the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as the great banner of the people of South Vietnam and the organizer and leader of their victories. He pointed out that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, relying on the broad masses of the people, has highly demonstrated the power of people's war, uniting the 14 million people of South Vietnam into an unbreakable iron wall, achieving great victories in the just war of resistance against the U.S. and national salvation.

	He said that the victories of the people of South Vietnam have crushed the arrogance of U.S. imperialism and boosted the morale of the revolutionary people. It shows to the world that in the face of a united people who dare to struggle and dare to win, the seemingly powerful U.S. imperialism can be defeated.

	Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the Johnson administration is trying to find a way out through escalating the war and playing the "peace talks" deception.

	For a long time, U.S. imperialism has used the bombing of Hanoi as a trump card in its war of intimidation against the Vietnamese people. They thought that by bombing Hanoi, they could intimidate the Vietnamese people, force the people of North Vietnam to stop supporting their southern compatriots, and make the Vietnamese people surrender. He emphasized that the facts are the opposite of the wishes of U.S. imperialism. The bombing of Hanoi has only increased the anger and hatred of the Vietnamese people, uniting the 31 million Vietnamese people more closely, and thus doubling the strikes against the U.S. aggressors.

	In praising the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam, Vice Premier Chen Yi said that in the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, the 700 million Chinese people have always stood firmly with the Vietnamese people, sharing their fate and breathing together. The struggle of the Vietnamese people has supported us, the victories of the Vietnamese people have inspired us, and the great heroic spirit of the Vietnamese people has set an example for us to learn from.

	Those who were invited to attend the reception also included relevant officials Gao Zongmin, Li Siguang, Xu Dehua, Fu Zuoyi, Cai Tingkai, Yang Xiufeng, Zhang Dingcheng, Yang Chengwu, and Liao Chengzhi.

	Vietnamese Ambassador to China Tran Xuan Bach and diplomats from various countries in China, as well as some foreign friends in Beijing, were also invited to attend the reception.

    新华社二十日讯　越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代理团长阮明芳今晚举行盛大招待会，热烈庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立六周年。
    党和国家领导人周恩来、陶铸、康生、陈毅、李先念、刘宁一、郭沫若等，应邀出席了招待会。
    阮明芳代理团长和陈毅副总理在招待会上先后讲话。陈毅副总理强调指出，同越南人民紧紧站在一起的七亿中国人民，时刻注视着越南局势的发展，牢记自己的国际主义义务，决心以最大的力量，更有效地支援兄弟的越南人民，彻底打败美国侵略者。
    招待会在北京饭店举行。招待会大厅里充满了中越两国人民战斗团结的强烈气氛。人们热烈祝贺越南南方人民运用伟大的人民战争，在抗美救国斗争中所取得的辉煌胜利。
    阮明芳在讲话中介绍了越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下所取得的光辉的胜利，严厉谴责了美帝国主义轰炸河内的罪行。他指出，美帝国主义进行的新的战争“升级”行动，妄图迫使越南南方人民接受美帝国主义的所谓“和平谈判”的骗人把戏。但是，越南南方军民决不放松警惕，决心成五倍、成十倍地痛惩敌人，决心打到底，打到美帝国主义的侵略阴谋被彻底粉碎，以便解放南方，保卫北方，统一祖国。
    他说，美帝国主义是当前全世界各民族最大的敌人。出于对祖国的责任，对世界人民的义务，越南南方人民愿意担负起反美第一线的任务，不惜牺牲生命，坚决打败美帝国主义在越南南方的侵略战争，为各国人民争取独立、和平、民主和社会进步的斗争事业作出贡献。
    他说，中国和越南是同一条反美战壕中的战友。中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民在精神上和物质上给了越南南方人民无价的支持。越南南方人民和越南南方民族解放阵线无比感谢毛主席，感谢中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民的无比巨大和有效的支持。
    阮明芳在谈了越南南方人民和世界各国人民在反美斗争中互相支持互相鼓舞的情况以后说，越南南方人民坚信，有了全民团结的力量，有了坚决斗争的意志，在越南南方人民唯一真正的代表——越南南方民族解放阵线的英明领导下，有了北方骨肉同胞的同心协力，又得到中国人民和世界各国人民的同情和支持，越南南方人民必将取得最后胜利。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中热烈赞扬越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民的伟大旗手，是越南南方人民胜利的组织者和领导者。他指出，越南南方民族解放阵线，依靠广大人民群众，高度发挥了人民战争的威力，把一千四百万越南南方人民，团结成为任何力量也打不破的真正的铜墙铁壁，在抗美救国的正义战争中，取得了伟大的胜利。
    他说，越南南方人民的胜利，灭了美帝国主义的威风，长了革命人民的志气。它向全世界表明，在团结起来、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的人民面前，貌似强大的美帝国主义，是完全可以被打败的。
    陈毅副总理指出，约翰逊政府妄图用扩大战争的行动和玩弄“和谈”的欺骗，来为自己寻找一条出路。
    长期以来，美帝国主义就把轰炸河内作为对越南人民进行战争讹诈的一张王牌。他们以为，只要一炸河内，就可以吓倒越南人民，就可以迫使越南北方人民停止对南方同胞的支援，就可以使越南人民屈服投降。他强调说，事实同美帝国主义的愿望相反，轰炸河内，更加激起了越南人民的愤怒和仇恨，使三千一百万越南人民更加同仇敌忾，团结一致，从而以加倍的打击，惩罚美国侵略者。
    陈毅副总理在赞颂中越两国人民的战斗友谊时说，在越南人民的抗美救国斗争中，七亿中国人民始终同越南人民紧紧地站在一起，和越南人民同命运共呼吸。越南人民的斗争支持了我们，越南人民的胜利鼓舞了我们，越南人民的大无畏的英雄气概，给我们树立了学习的榜样。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有有关方面负责人高崇民、李四光、许德珩、傅作义、蔡廷锴、杨秀峰、张鼎丞、杨成武、廖承志等。
    越南驻中国大使陈子平和各国驻中国使节以及在京的一些外国朋友也应邀出席了招待会。
