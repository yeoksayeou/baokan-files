Chairman Mao says: All revolutionary writers and artists must connect with the masses, represent the masses, and act as the masses' faithful spokespeople. Only then will their work have meaning. PLA Air Force soldier Shen Peichun says:

The heroic image of Yang Zhirong in "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is the embodiment of countless heroes in the People's Liberation Army. As a soldier of the PLA, I watched this play and felt particularly moved. "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" vividly tells us that the people's army wins battles not with airplanes, cannons, or atomic bombs, but with the armor of Mao Zedong Thought.

PLA soldier Yang Yaoqing says:

The success of the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" lies in its answer to the question of where Yang Zhirong's great wisdom and courage come from. They come from the great Mao Zedong Thought. The pursuit team entered the vast forests and snowy plains following Chairman Mao's directive to "establish a solid base in Northeast China," coming to the Mudanjiang area to mobilize the masses and eliminate bandits. Yang Zhirong, born into a poor peasant family, saw his parents suffer at the hands of landlords and reactionaries. Therefore, he has a clear class stance and a deep hatred for the enemy. He always remembers the Party and Chairman Mao's teachings, remembers the people's interests, and is always ready to sacrifice for them. In the most difficult moments of struggle, he thinks of "having the sun in his heart," gaining the strength to defeat the enemy and the determination to win. Comrade Lin Biao said: "For our army, the best weapon is not the airplane, not the cannon, not the tank, not the atomic bomb. The best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. The greatest combat effectiveness is people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and fearless of death." Yang Zhirong's courage in fighting the enemy on Tiger Mountain comes from the sun in his heart—Mao Zedong Thought. In the future, we must take Yang Zhirong as our example, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, cultivate a fearless revolutionary spirit, and be ready at any time to annihilate all enemies who dare to invade.

A worker from Beijing says:

The revised revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Sha Jianhu" has strengthened its political and ideological content, making the heroic images of the positive characters more vivid. The character of Guo Jian'guang, the commander of the New Fourth Army, has been newly created, highlighting his loyalty to the Party, loyalty to the people, and his heroic courage and wisdom. Facing numerous difficulties, he is fearless and always maintains the composure, calmness, and decisiveness of a commander. Under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the masses, he finally overcomes all difficulties and annihilates the enemy. This heroic image, shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, leaves a deep and unforgettable impression on us.

A cadre from Guangdong says:

I had the opportunity to watch the ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" and felt very happy and satisfied. The characters on stage who inspire and motivate the audience are not queens, princes, demons, or immortals, but the brilliant and radiant heroic figures from our country's revolutionary history. They have boldly entered this "forbidden zone" of dance, isn't this ballet revolution a great red flag of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, bringing proletarian revolutionary fighting art onto the Chinese and world ballet stage?

Zhao Weizeng from Beijing says:

The adaptation and performance of the ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" are very successful. The plot is concise, and the theme is clear. The use of form and dance vocabulary is harmonious, natural, smooth, and yet unrestrained, effectively expressing the theme. Especially, it incorporates the characteristics of Chinese classical dance and ethnic folk dance, making it powerful and bold. The dance of the female Red Army soldiers expresses a very moving atmosphere. The scene where the Li people welcome the revolutionary troops is unforgettable. The female Red Army soldiers' leaping and charging actions during their march fully display their heroic demeanor. Other performances, such as the soldiers' skills in formation, stabbing, and sniping, are very vivid and full of life and struggle.

Ballet art should be revolutionary. As a superstructure of socialism, it should serve the socialist economic base, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and become a powerful weapon for "uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy." I am happy about the successful performance of the ballet "The Red Detachment of Women." I wish the ballet revolution under the great red flag of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought new victories.

    光彩夺目的革命英雄形象
    毛主席说：一切革命的文学家艺术家只有联系群众，表现群众，把自己当作群众的忠实的代言人，他们的工作才有意义。解放军空军战士沈培春说：
    《智取威虎山》中杨子荣的英雄形象，是中国人民解放军千千万万个英雄的化身。我作为解放军一个战士，看了这出戏，感到分外真切。《智取威虎山》用生动的形象告诉我们，人民的军队打胜仗靠的不是飞机、大炮、原子弹，而是靠毛泽东思想的武装。
           ＊　＊　＊解放军战士杨尧深说：
    革命京剧现代戏《智取威虎山》的成功，在于它回答了杨子荣的大智大勇是从哪里来的这一问题。它来自伟大的毛泽东思想。追剿队深入林海雪原，是遵照毛主席“建立巩固的东北根据地”的指示，来到牡丹江一带发动群众，消灭土匪的。杨子荣是贫农出身，父母都遭受地主、反动派的摧残。因此，他有着鲜明的阶级立场，对敌人有着刻骨仇恨。他时刻记住党和毛主席的教导，记住人民的利益，并随时准备为之献身。在斗争最艰苦的时刻，他想起“胸有朝阳”，就有了战胜敌人的力量，决心就大了。林彪同志说：“对我们军队来说，最好的武器不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，最好的武器是毛泽东思想。最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢、不怕死。”杨子荣在威虎山与敌人作战时所表现的胆略，就是来自胸中的朝阳毛泽东思想。今后，我们一定要以杨子荣为榜样，用毛泽东思想武装自己，树立大无畏的革命精神，随时准备消灭敢于来犯的一切敌人。
          ＊　＊　＊北京一位工人说：
    修改后的革命现代京剧《沙家浜》，政治思想内容更加强了，正面人物的英雄形象更鲜明了，新四军指导员郭建光这个人物有了新创造，突出了他忠于党、忠于人民、有勇有谋的英雄气概。在重重困难面前，他毫不畏惧，始终保持了一个指挥员应有的沉着、冷静、果断，在党的领导和群众的支持下，终于战胜了重重困难，歼灭了敌人。这一闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的英雄形象，给我们留下了深刻难忘的印象。
             　＊　＊　＊广东一位干部说：
    有机会看了芭蕾舞《红色娘子军》，感到十分高兴和满足……舞台上感染和激励观众的人物，不是王后公主、妖魔仙人，而是我国革命历史上光辉夺目的英雄形象。他们大踏步地闯进了这舞蹈天地的“禁区”，不正好说明了这次芭蕾舞的革命，高举了毛主席文艺思想的伟大红旗，把无产阶级革命的战斗文艺，带进了中国和世界的芭蕾舞台吗？
            ＊　＊　＊北京赵唯增说：
    芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》的改编和演出是十分成功的。剧情简练，主题突出。在表现形式和舞蹈语汇的运用上融洽、自然、流畅而又奔放，很好地表达了主题。特别是吸收了中国古典舞、民族民间舞的特点，显得豪放有力。女红军舞所表达的意境十分感人。剧中黎族人民热爱革命队伍的场面，使人久久难忘。女红军战士在过场中冲锋的跳跃冲刺动作，充分表现了她们的飒爽英姿。其他如演员们在队列、刺杀、狙击时的技艺，生活感、斗争感十分强烈。
    芭蕾舞艺术应该革命。作为社会主义的上层建筑，它应当为社会主义的经济基础服务，为工农兵服务，成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”。我为芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》的成功演出而高兴。祝芭蕾舞的革命在毛主席文艺思想的伟大红旗下，争取新的胜利。
