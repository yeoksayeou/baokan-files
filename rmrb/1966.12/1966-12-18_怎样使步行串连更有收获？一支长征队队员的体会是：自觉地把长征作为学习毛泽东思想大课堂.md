The report says: “The thousand-mile Long March is a great school for studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, and a good classroom for learning from the workers and peasants.” “We must advance with a revolutionary spirit of seizing the day, learning as we go, breaking down selfishness, and reforming ourselves as we go.” This is the profound experience of a Long March team from the students of the Logistics Department of the General Logistics Department of the PLA.

	To Face Difficulties Head-On
These young comrades realized during the Long March that no matter what difficulties they encountered, they must face them with revolutionary enthusiasm and overcome them. Each time they overcome a difficulty, they gain a bit more of the spirit of selflessness and reduce a bit of selfishness.

A few days after they set out, several of them got blisters on their feet. Liu Chen, who was not used to walking, had swollen ankles. The villagers saw this and advised him to rest for a day or two. His comrades also wanted him to take a ride in a passing car. He said, “On the Long March, we must face difficulties head-on and not fear hardship. We must not be a ‘shortfall’ member. Blisters and swelling show that we lacked training in the past, and today we must make up for this lesson.” He recited Chairman Mao’s teachings, “Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory,” and followed the team, walking with increasing vigor. He said with deep feeling, “If you always think of ‘me,’ you won’t be able to take a single step; if you think of the Long March as a means of revolutionary tempering and think of the public good, no matter how great the difficulty, you can overcome it.”

One day, they took a wrong turn, and by the time it got dark, they had not reached the designated campsite. In a state of hunger and fatigue, everyone’s legs softened and they could not walk, so they took a ride in a car for a while. Later, they reviewed the incident and found that the reason they faltered in the face of difficulties was that they had strayed from Chairman Mao’s teachings. They always kept this incident as a lesson.

Another day in the afternoon, they still had more than twenty miles to go to reach the designated campsite. Suddenly, the weather changed. The wind blew fiercely, the rain poured down, the road became slippery, and their legs did not obey their commands. At that moment, they happened to pass by a village, and the villagers enthusiastically invited them to stay and avoid the wind and rain. They looked at the pouring rain and recited Chairman Mao’s teachings, “The Red Army is not afraid of the difficulties of the Long March.” Scenes of the Red Army crossing snow-capped mountains and grasslands appeared in their minds. Chairman Mao’s teachings and the examples of revolutionary forerunners made them realize how to face difficulties, which is a test of one’s revolutionary will. Today, the wind and rain beat against their flesh, tempering their revolutionary will. In the face of wind and rain, to bow one’s head means to suffer a defeat in the struggle between public and private interests. Some comrades also said, “Natural wind and rain can be avoided, but the wind and rain of class struggle cannot be avoided. Today, if we dodge and yield to the wind and rain of nature on the revolutionary journey, tomorrow we will not be able to charge forward and be the vanguard in the wind and rain of class struggle.”

Thinking of this, their revolutionary spirit was greatly aroused. Thus, facing the cold wind and pouring rain, they held high the banner of the Long March, singing songs of Chairman Mao’s quotations, and continued to march towards the designated campsite. Although the journey was tiring, when they arrived at the campsite, they truly felt the joy of “after the army passes, everything is smiling,” and they felt a great spiritual harvest.

	Learn from the Workers and Peasants
In the first few days after they set out, although they paid attention to doing some propaganda work along the way, they neglected learning from the workers and peasants. One day, soon after they left Su County, Anhui, they met a fellow traveler, a villager. Along the way, they talked and quickly became familiar with each other. The young comrades thought, isn’t this a good object for propagating Mao Zedong Thought? They never expected that when they mentioned studying Chairman Mao’s works, this villager would enthusiastically talk about many moving examples of villagers studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works. When they parted, this villager also recited several quotations from Chairman Mao, encouraging them to follow Chairman Mao’s instructions, overcome difficulties, and complete the Long March.

This incident greatly inspired the Long March team. They asked themselves: Why, when encountering workers and peasants, did they not first think of learning from them? After a discussion, they finally found the reason: Although they also talked about learning from the workers and peasants, in their minds, they always felt that they knew more than the workers and peasants. Therefore, when facing the workers and peasants, they only thought of being teachers and did not think of being students. Everyone agreed that an important purpose of the Long March was to learn from the workers and peasants, and to truly treat the workers and peasants as teachers, they must first put down the arrogance of intellectuals and must acknowledge that the masses are the real heroes, while they themselves are often naive and laughable.

The problem of learning from the masses was addressed, but at the beginning, they often only asked if there were any heroic models in the local area. One day, as they passed by a village, an old man in his fifties or sixties had prepared hot water by the roadside. After they drank the water, they wanted to pay, but the old man refused to accept it and kindly said, “Drinking my water does not require payment. I am doing a little bit of good for the people according to Chairman Mao’s teachings. You are making a revolution, and I am happy to see it. You can see Chairman Mao in Beijing, and this is my greatest happiness.” The old man’s earnest words deeply educated the team members. They asked themselves a question: On the Long March, should they limit their learning activities to a few heroic models, or should they learn as they go? They felt that in the past, they only saw heroic models and did not see the vast majority of workers and peasants, which showed that they had not truly established the idea of being a humble student of the workers and peasants. From then on, they set a rule for themselves: Every day, they must study Chairman Mao’s teachings, observe the actions of the workers and peasants, and reflect on their own thoughts.

The members of this Long March team believed that the Long March under their feet was a good classroom. Millions of workers and peasants were good teachers. To learn the excellent qualities of the workers and peasants, they must compare their own actions with those of the workers and peasants every day. One evening, they arrived at the reception station in Fucheng. After lying down, team member Gu Xuewen kept thinking about the enthusiastic reception by the reception station staff. Especially, a service worker saw that his upper garment had a torn hole and offered to sew it up five or six times. The spirit of the reception station staff being so enthusiastic and responsible for their work made him recall his own carelessness in work and lack of enthusiasm for his classmates when he was a deputy class leader in school. Compared with the reception station staff in Fucheng, he found that the main problem was that there was a “selfish” element in his soul, and he was still far from the requirements of being extremely enthusiastic and responsible. The next morning before they set out, he and his comrades quoted Chairman Mao’s teachings, “Extreme responsibility for work, extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people,” and wrote a letter of thanks to the reception station. This letter also expressed their own determination to sincerely study and apply Chairman Mao’s works and to humbly learn from the workers and peasants.

	See Care as a Spur
Once, the Long March team had lunch at the canteen of the Dezhou Knitting Factory. A cook gave a team member two steamed buns made of white flour. He had already sat down and started eating when he noticed that the workers in the same canteen each had one steamed bun made of white flour and one steamed bun made of corn flour. At first, he thought about exchanging for a corn bun, but then he thought, since he was just passing through, eating an extra steamed bun made of white flour wouldn’t matter. Later, he studied Chairman Mao’s teachings, “Let others enjoy,” and realized his mistake. In his diary that day, he wrote, “A revolutionary soldier, when facing two different treatments, should you enjoy the better one or the worse one? You should leave the better one for others and the worse one for yourself. But I did the opposite. In the future, I must constantly struggle against the non-proletarian thoughts in my mind.”

Through this incident, the Long March team members asked themselves a new question: How should they treat the care and attention of the people along the way? They pondered this question while studying Chairman Mao’s works and recalling the purpose of their Long March, gradually realizing that the workers and peasants always wanted the team members to live comfortably and eat well, which was the workers and peasants’ concern, support, and love for them. If they accepted this care and thought that enjoying a little was okay, it would mean acknowledging their own “specialness” and being different from the workers and peasants, which would be wrong.

From then on, no matter where they went, when the people wanted to give them special treatment in their lives, they politely declined. They believed that the people’s care for them was the greatest spur, and they should strive with a revolutionary spirit of seizing the day to reform their thoughts and better serve the people. If they accepted special treatment in their lives with a clear conscience, it would increase their selfishness and unconsciously neglect their own thought reform.

This Long March team, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, paid attention to strictly demanding of themselves, breaking down selfishness and establishing public spirit. After the Long March, they made great strides in thought revolutionization.

    怎样使步行串连更有收获？一支长征队队员的体会是：自觉地把长征作为学习毛泽东思想大课堂
    本报讯　“千里长征路，是活学活用毛主席著作的大学校，是向工农群众学习的好课堂。”“要用只争朝夕的革命精神，走一路，学一路，破私立公，改造一路。”这是解放军总后勤部某部学员一支长征队的深刻体会。
        要迎着困难上
    这些小将在长征过程中体会到：不管碰到什么困难，都要满怀革命豪情地迎上去，战胜它。每战胜一次困难，就多一分“公”字，少一分私心。
    他们出发没几天，几个人脚上都起了泡。平时很少走路的刘晨，两只脚脖子肿了。社员们见了都劝他休息一两天，同志们也想叫他坐一段顺路的车子。他说：“在长征路上，要迎着困难上，决不能怕吃苦，决不能当‘歉收’队员。脚打了泡，肿了，正说明过去缺少锻炼，今天就该补上这一课。”他背诵着毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，紧跟队伍，越走劲头越足。他深有体会地说：“要是老想着‘我’字，那就半步也走不动；一想到长征是为了进行革命锻炼，想到‘公’字，困难再大，也能克服了。”
    一天，他们走错了路，天已黑了，还没有到达预定宿营地。在又饥又累的情况下，大家的腿都软了，走不动了，就坐了一段路的车子。后来，他们检查所以在困难面前腿软，不是别的原因，就是离开了毛主席的教导。他们一直把这件事情作为教训。
    又一天下午，距离预定的宿营地还有二十多里路，天气突然变了。风吹得很紧，雨下得又急，道路一步比一步滑，两条腿也不大听使唤了。当时，正好路过一个村子，社员们热情地留他们住下，要他们避避风雨。他们望着倾盆大雨，背诵着毛主席“红军不怕远征难”的教导，头脑里顿时出现了红军爬雪山过草地的情景。毛主席的教导，革命老前辈的榜样，使他们认识到如何对待困难，是对一个人的革命意志的考验。今天，狂风暴雨吹打的是皮肉，磨炼的是革命意志。在急风暴雨面前低头，就意味着在公与私的搏斗中，打了一次败仗。有的同志还说：“自然界的风雨可以躲避，阶级斗争的风雨是没办法躲避的。今天我们在革命的征途上，对大自然的风雨躲躲闪闪，低头让步，明天在阶级斗争的风雨中，也不会冲锋陷阵，勇当尖兵。”
    想到这些，他们的革命精神大大振作。于是，迎着寒风，冒着急雨，高举长征的队旗，高唱着毛主席语录歌，继续向预定宿营地前进。路上虽然辛苦一些，但是到达宿营地以后，真正体会到了“三军过后尽开颜”的欢乐，思想上感到有特别大的收获。
        拜工农为师
    出发的头几天，他们虽然注意在沿途做了一些宣传工作，但是忽视了向工农群众学习。有一天，他们从安徽宿县出发不久，就碰到了一位同路的社员，一路上，他们边走边谈，很快就熟了。小将们心想，这不正是个宣传毛泽东思想的对象吗？他们万没想到，一提起学习毛主席著作，这位社员就滔滔不绝地讲了许多社员活学活用毛主席著作的感人事例。分别时，这位社员还背诵了几条毛主席语录，鼓励他们照毛主席的指示去做，克服困难，长征到底。
    这件事，使长征队员大受启发。他们问自己：为什么一接触工农群众，首先想到的不是向工农学习呢？经过一番议论，他们终于找到了原因：尽管口头上也讲要向工农群众学习，但头脑里却总觉得自己知道的东西比工农群众多。因此，在工农群众面前，就只想到当先生，没有想到当学生。大家一致认为，徒步串连的一个重要目的，是向工农学习，要真正拜工农为师，就必须先放下知识分子的臭架子，就必须承认群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的。
    向群众学习的问题注意了，但开始时，他们往往只打听当地有没有英雄模范人物。有一天，路过一个村口，有一位五六十岁的老大爷，在路旁准备好了开水。他们喝完开水要给钱，老大爷怎么也不肯收，并亲切地说：“喝我的开水，是不收钱的。我这是照毛主席的教导，做了一点有益于人民的事情。你们是在闹革命，我看了高兴，你们到北京能见到毛主席，这也是我的最大幸福。”这位老人语重心长的谈话，使队员们受到了很深的教育。他们给自己提出了一个问题：在长征路上，是把学习活动只放在少数英雄模范人物身上，还是走一路学一路呢？他们感到，过去只看到英雄模范人物，没有看到广大的工农群众，说明自己还没有真正树立起甘当工农群众的小学生的思想。这样，接触工农群众就不会广泛，就不会深入。打这以后，他们给自己立了一条规矩：每天都要学习毛主席的教导，看工农群众的行动，想自己的思想改造。
    这个长征队的队员们认为：脚下的这条长征路，是个很好的大课堂。千千万万的工农群众，就是很好的老师。要想学到工农群众的优秀品质，就要天天拿工农的言行对照自己。一天晚上，他们来到富镇接待站。躺下以后，队员顾学文总是想着接待站同志们热情接待的情景。特别是有个服务员见他上衣撕破个口子，先后五六次拿着针线要给他缝补。接待站的工作人员对同志这样热情，对工作这么负责的精神，不由得使他回想起自己在学校当副班长，对工作马虎了事和对同学不够热情的事，同富镇接待站工作人员一比，发现主要是自己灵魂深处有个“私”字在作怪，距离极端热忱、极端负责任的要求还相差很远。第二天清早出发以前，他和同伴们引用毛主席的教导：“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”，给接待站写了一封感谢信。这封信也表达了他们自己活学活用毛主席著作，老老实实向工农群众学习的决心。
        视关怀为鞭策
    有一次，长征队在德州针织厂食堂吃饭，炊事员递给一个队员两个白面馒头。他已经坐下来开始吃了，才发现在同一个食堂吃饭的工人，每人都是一个白面馒头，一个玉米面窝窝头。开始，他想去换个窝窝头，可又一想，自己打这儿路过，多吃一个白面馒头，也没什么。事后，他学习了毛主席说的“享受让给人家”的教导，才认识到自己的不对。他在当天的日记里写道：“一个革命战士在两种不同的待遇面前，你是享受好的呢，还是享受较差的呢？应该把好的留给别人，差的留给自己。而我却相反。今后必须时刻同头脑里的非无产阶级思想作斗争。”
    通过这件事，长征队员们给自己提出一个新的问题：如何对待沿路人民群众对自己的关怀和照顾？他们带着这个问题学习毛主席著作，回想自己出来长征的目的，逐渐认识到：工农群众总想叫队员们住得舒服一些，吃点好的，这是工农群众对自己的关心、支持和爱护。如果接受了这种照顾，觉得享受点也没啥，就等于承认自己“特殊”，和工农群众不一样，那就错了。
    从此以后，不论走到哪里，当群众要在生活上给他们特殊照顾的时候，他们都诚恳地婉言谢绝。他们认为，人民群众对自己的关怀，就是最大的鞭策，应该以只争朝夕的革命精神去改造思想，更好地为人民服务。如果心安理得地去接受在生活上的特殊照顾，就会增长私心，自觉不自觉地忽视了自己的思想改造。
    这个长征队以毛泽东思想为武器，注意严格要求自己，破“私”立“公”，经过徒步串连以后，在思想革命化方面迈进了一大步。
