On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War," freedom fighters from the Congo (L), Mozambique, and Zimbabwe spoke to the Xinhua News Agency's correspondent in Cairo. They unanimously agreed that the great strategic ideas of people's war and the entire set of strategic and tactical principles expounded by Chairman Mao point the way to victory for the struggle for liberation of the oppressed peoples.

These freedom fighters all said that they and their comrades are intensively studying Chairman Mao's work published in December 1936 and other military works by Chairman Mao.

A freedom fighter from the Congo (L) front lines said, "When I read this great work, I found that there are similar problems in our armed struggle as pointed out in the article. The Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, have already won the final victory in the revolutionary war. The path that Chairman Mao led the Chinese people to take is also the path that the oppressed peoples, including the Congolese (L), will take."

A Mozambican freedom fighter deeply believed in this famous statement by Chairman Mao in "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War": "Use national revolutionary war to counter national counter-revolutionary war." He cited the example of Mozambique suffering under Portuguese colonial rule, saying, "If it were not as Chairman Mao pointed out, to use revolutionary violence to counter the violence of colonial rule, how could the Mozambican people achieve independence? This is a truth for us oppressed peoples."

A Zimbabwean freedom fighter said, "The experiences of China's revolutionary war summarized by Chairman Mao are very beneficial to us. Applying it in our struggle is a guarantee of our victory." He added, "Revolutionary peoples all over the world are learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, using it as the guiding principle for the liberation of their own countries. Reading Chairman Mao's books, one can find the correct direction." He said, "Our struggle experience has already proven the bankruptcy of some people's empty talk, who say that liberation can be achieved through peaceful means. We have come to realize that the only way for us to achieve liberation is to use the gun to counter the gun." He felt very fortunate because Mao Zedong Thought is guiding their struggle. He went on to point out that the theory of people's war put forward by Chairman Mao has been proven successful by the people's revolutionary wars in China, Vietnam, and other countries.

The three freedom fighters all study Chairman Mao's works in conjunction with their own experiences. They believe that Chairman Mao's assertion that "revolutionary war is the war of the masses" is very instructive. After analyzing various examples from different angles, they reached a conclusion: only with the active participation and support of the people can armed struggle achieve victory.

The Congolese (L) freedom fighter added, "I completely agree with Chairman Mao's assertion of learning war from war. I have read the sixteen-character formula for guerrilla warfare: 'When the enemy advances, we retreat; when the enemy halts, we harass; when the enemy is tired, we attack; when the enemy retreats, we pursue,' but it is only through engaging in combat that I understand why and how to implement this sixteen-character formula."

    非洲自由战士畅谈学习《中国革命战争的战略问题》的体会
    毛主席向被压迫人民指出争取解放的胜利道路
    在人民积极参加和支持下，武装斗争就能取得胜利
    据新华社开罗二十一日电　在毛主席的光辉著作《中国革命战争的战略问题》发表三十周年之际，来自刚果（利）、莫三鼻给和津巴布韦的自由战士们在这里分别向新华社记者发表谈话，他们一致认为：毛主席所阐明的人民战争的伟大战略思想和一整套战略战术原则，向被压迫人民指出了争取解放斗争的胜利道路。
    这些自由战士都说，他们和他们的战友正在加紧学习毛主席在一九三六年十二月发表的这一著作和毛主席的其他军事著作。
    来自武装斗争前线的刚果（利）的一位自由战士说：“我在读这部伟大的著作的时候，发现在我们的武装斗争中存在着文章中所指出的类似的问题。中国人民在毛主席的领导下已经赢得了革命战争的最后胜利。毛主席所指引的中国人民走过的道路，也就是包括刚果（利）人民在内的被压迫人民将要走的道路。”
    一位莫三鼻给自由战士表示深深信服毛主席在《中国革命战争的战略问题》一书中的这句名言：“用民族革命战争反对民族反革命战争”。他以莫三鼻给遭受葡萄牙殖民主义者的统治为例说：“如果不是像毛主席指出的那样，用革命的暴力来反对殖民主义统治的暴力，莫三鼻给人民怎么能够取得独立呢？这对我们被压迫人民来说，是一个真理。”
    一位津巴布韦自由战士说：“毛主席总结的中国革命战争的经验对我们十分有益，我们在斗争中运用它是我们取得胜利的保证。”他还说：“全世界的革命人民正在学习和运用毛泽东思想，把它作为实现自己祖国的解放的指导方针。读了毛主席的书，就能找到正确的方向。”他说：“我们斗争的经验已经证明了某些人的一些陈词滥调的破产，他们胡说什么通过和平道路来取得解放。我们已经认识到，我们获得解放的唯一途径是用枪杆子来反对枪杆子。”他说，他感到非常幸运，因为有毛泽东思想指导着他们的斗争。他接着指出，毛主席“关于人民战争的理论已经被中国、越南和其他国家的人民革命战争证明是成功的。”
    这三位自由战士都在结合自己的经验学习毛主席著作，他们认为，毛主席的“革命战争是群众的战争”这一论断是非常有教益的。他们从各个角度，对各种实例进行分析后得出了一个结论，那就是：只有在人民积极参加和支持下，武装斗争才能得到胜利。
    那一位刚果（利）自由战士接着说：“我完全同意毛主席的从战争学习战争这一论断。我早就念过游击战十六字诀“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”，但是只有通过从事战斗，我才理解到为什么要和如何去实行这个十六字诀。”（附图片）
