In the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan and amidst the high tide of the Cultural Revolution, the workers of the Daqing Oil Field, who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, especially the "Three Articles," more earnestly and diligently. They are striding forward on the path of ideological revolution, thereby pushing the oil field's production and construction to new heights.

By December 22, the construction, drilling, and crude oil production of the Daqing Oil Field had completed this year's plan ahead of schedule. Whether in construction or production, this year has achieved the best results in terms of speed, quality, and technological innovation since the start of the campaign. Compared to last year, drilling, oil extraction, and refining production, as well as the labor productivity of the entire oil field industry, have all seen significant improvements.

The drilling line workers have overcome the numerous difficulties of the rainy and winter seasons, achieving the highest level since the campaign began. So far, the total number of wells drilled has exceeded the annual plan by more than 30%, with all wells meeting quality standards and a full excellence rate of 99.7%, breaking all previous drilling records. The 1202 and 1205 drilling teams have both reached 100,000 meters in drilling depth in just 11 months and 5 days, setting a world record. The construction workers of the oil field, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, and undaunted by heat or cold, have completed the planned scale of construction ahead of schedule by three months, despite having fewer personnel and 30% more work than last year. By the end of September, they had built four combined pump stations that reached world-class standards.

The refinery workers, in their pursuit of the latest technology of the 1960s, have strategically disregarded difficulties while tactically paying attention to them. They have led modern equipment with revolutionary ideology, completing a batch of new refinery facilities this year with speed, efficiency, and high quality. They have also carried out technical renovations on some of the original refinery facilities, thereby increasing the refining capacity by 50% compared to last year. At the same time, new products have been produced in batches, with seven technological and economic indicators surpassing world-class standards.

The oil extraction line workers have implemented large-scale stratified oil extraction this year and, around this center, have entered a new stage of stratified testing, research, management, and oil field transformation, further realizing the long-term stable and high production of the oil field.

Raising High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought to Overcome Severe Natural Disasters

China's Livestock Industry Achieves Continuous Bumper Harvests

Horses, cattle, mules, donkeys, pigs, and sheep all increased compared to last year, marking the fifth consecutive year of bumper harvests since 1962.

According to Xinhua News Agency on December 26, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, China's livestock industry has achieved its fifth consecutive year of bumper harvests since 1962.

Statistics from relevant departments show that this year, the number of horses, cattle, mules, donkeys, pigs, and sheep in China have all increased to varying degrees compared to last year. According to statistics from seven provinces and cities in the north, the growth rate of large livestock this year is much higher than last year. Provinces like Henan and Shandong have set historical records for the growth rate of large livestock. With the strengthening of the promotion of superior breeds and the improvement of feeding and management, the quality of livestock has generally improved, with the quality of horses and sheep showing more significant improvements.

The continuous bumper harvests in China's livestock industry are a victory of the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and a victory of emphasizing proletarian politics and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to guide livestock production in various places.

This year, many regions in northern and southern China have experienced severe droughts, and some northern regions have also been hit by heavy snowstorms, bringing difficulties such as insufficient water for livestock, dried grass, and increased livestock diseases. However, the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have shown a great revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win. They have launched mass campaigns to fight against disasters and protect livestock. The farmers and herdsmen have proudly declared: With Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's leadership, no difficulty is too great for us. The main pastoral areas of Xinjiang have suffered a rare heavy snowstorm in decades, with pastures generally covered by deep snow, usually reaching 60-70 centimeters, and up to 2-3 meters in some mountainous areas. However, the herdsmen, following Chairman Mao's teachings: "Make up your mind, be fearless of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," have achieved great victories in their anti-disaster and livestock protection struggles despite the fierce winds and heavy snow. The entire state has achieved a livestock survival rate of 96%, and the survival rate of foals, calves, lambs, and piglets has reached over 92%.

Due to the efforts of the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen in fighting against disasters, the livestock survival rate and the survival rate of young livestock such as foals, calves, lambs, and piglets in regions like Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan, and Yunnan have all seen new improvements compared to last year, thereby promoting the development of the livestock industry.

In the development of livestock production, various places have seriously implemented Chairman Mao's policy of combining agriculture and animal husbandry. Through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and summarizing past experiences, the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen have further understood the interdependent, mutually promoting, and dialectical relationship between agriculture and animal husbandry, significantly enhancing their awareness of implementing the policy of combining agriculture and animal husbandry. Not only has agriculture developed, but animal husbandry has also flourished.

    在思想革命化大道上阔步前进
    把油田生产建设推到新的高峰
    大庆油田高速度高质量完成今年生产建设计划
    据新华社二十八日讯　在第三个五年计划的第一年，在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的大庆油田职工，更加认真地、刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，特别是活学活用“老三篇”，在思想革命化的道路上阔步前进，从而把油田的生产建设又推进到一个新的高峰。
    到十二月二十二日止，大庆油田的建设、钻井和原油生产已经提前完成了全年计划。无论是建设或生产，今年都取得了会战以来速度最快、质量最好、技术革新成果最大的优异成绩。同去年比较，钻井、采油和炼油生产以及油田工业全员劳动生产率等，都有大幅度的提高。
    钻井战线的工人们战胜了雨季和冬季作业的重重困难，打出了会战以来的最高水平。到目前为止，打井总数已经超过全年计划的百分之三十多，口口井质量合格，全优率高达百分之九十九点七，全部刷新了过去的钻井纪录。一二零二和一二零五两个钻井队，钻井总进尺双双以十一个月零五天的时间达到十万米，创造了世界最高纪录。油田建设工人，不怕苦，不怕累，不畏炎热，不惧风寒，在人员比去年减少，工程量比去年增加百分之三十的情况下，九月底就优质高速地建成了预定的规模，提前三个月完成了全年建设计划，其中有四座联合泵站达到了世界先进水平。
    炼油厂职工在攀登六十年代最新技术高峰的过程中，在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难，以革命化的思想统帅现代化的设备，今年又多快好省地建成了一批炼油新装置；对原来的一部分炼油装置也进行了技术改造，从而使炼油的加工能力比去年提高了百分之五十。同时，新产品成批增加，有七项技术经济指标超过了世界先进水平。
    采油战线职工，今年又在采油井上大面积实行分层采油，并围绕这个中心，开始跨入分层测试、分层研究、分层管理和分层改造油田开采的新阶段，进一步实现油田的长期稳定高产。
     高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，战胜严重自然灾害
    我国畜牧业今年持续丰收
    马、牛、骡、驴等大牲畜和猪、羊都比去年增长，取得了自一九六二年以来的第五个丰收年景
    据新华社二十六日讯在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导下，我国今年的畜牧业生产，取得了自一九六二年以来的第五个丰收年景。
    有关部门提供的资料表明，今年我国马、牛、骡、驴等大牲畜和猪、羊的头数都比去年有不同程度的增长。另据北方七省市的统计，大牲畜的增长速度比去年要大得多。河南、山东等省大牲畜的增长速度都创造了历史的最高纪录。随着良种推广工作的加强和饲养管理的改善，牲畜的质量普遍有了提高，其中马和绵羊质量的提高更为显著。
    我国畜牧业生产的持续丰收，是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，是各地突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想指导畜牧业生产的胜利。
    今年，我国南北不少地区发生了十分严重的干旱，北方有的地区还遭到了严重风雪袭击；这样，就给我国畜牧业生产带来了畜牧用水不足、牧草干枯和牲畜疫病增多等困难。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大农民和牧民，以敢于斗争，敢于胜利的大无畏的革命英雄气概，开展了群众性的抗灾保畜斗争。广大农民和牧民豪迈地提出：有毛泽东思想，有党的领导，天大的困难也难不倒我们。新疆主要牧区遭到几十年来未有的特大风雪灾害，牧场普遍被深雪覆盖，一般深达六七十厘米，有的山区深达两三米。但广大牧民遵照毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”。伊犁哈萨克自治州许多地区尽管风猛雪大，抗灾保畜斗争却取得了很大的胜利。全州成畜保畜率达百分之九十六，马驹、牛犊、羊羔的成活率达百分之九十二以上。
    由于广大农民和牧民奋起抗灾，宁夏、青海、四川、云南等省区，今年的成畜保畜率和马驹、牛犊、羊羔、仔猪等幼畜的成活率，都比去年又有新的提高，从而有力地促进了畜牧业的发展。
    各地在发展畜牧业生产中，认真执行了毛主席提出的农牧并举的方针。通过活学活用毛主席著作，通过对过去经验的认真总结，广大农民和牧民进一步认识了农业和牧业的相互依存，相互促进和辩证关系，贯彻农牧并举方针的自觉性大大提高。不仅农业发展了，畜牧业也发展了。
