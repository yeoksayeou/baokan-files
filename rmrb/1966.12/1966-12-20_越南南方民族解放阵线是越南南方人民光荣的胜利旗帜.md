Six years ago, on December 20, 1960, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam was born. This was a historic event of great significance, marking the fact that the people of South Vietnam could no longer live under the rule of American imperialism and its lackeys, and that no force could stop them from rising up to fight back. This also shows that the people of South Vietnam, facing a cruel and brutal enemy, must unite as one, strengthen their solidarity, rely on the masses and the great power of justice, to defeat the enemy, and be ready at any time to use revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence.

For the history of a nation, six years is a very short period. However, in the sacred struggle of the people of South Vietnam against the U.S. aggressors and for national salvation, every moment is filled with glorious victories, writing magnificent chapters of history.

I. The Strategic Victories and Leaps Forward Achieved by the People of South Vietnam in Military and Political Struggles

In the three strategic stages of its aggression against South Vietnam over twelve years, American imperialism has suffered complete failure in the first two stages, and the current third stage has also suffered heavy setbacks right from the start.

(1) First, after replacing the French colonialists in South Vietnam, American imperialism set up the puppet dictatorial regime of Ngo Dinh Diem and a mercenary army of fifty thousand men in South Vietnam, established a U.S. military command in Saigon to directly command the puppet government and puppet army, and under the guise of "advisors," brought in more than thirty thousand U.S. troops to South Vietnam, turning South Vietnam into a new type of American colony and military base. However, under the correct leadership of the National Liberation Front, the people of South Vietnam, combining revolutionary political violence with armed struggle, rose up in a full-scale guerrilla war, destroying "strategic hamlets," establishing revolutionary power in vast rural areas, and smashing the foundation of the Ngo Dinh Diem fascist regime with its thirty thousand puppet troops. They established rural revolutionary governments, foiling the American imperialists' plot to annihilate the revolutionary forces in the South and their plan to advance northward.

(2) After suffering defeat in the first stage, the Kennedy and Johnson administrations launched a "special war," arrogantly attempting to realize their wild and delusional "Straley-Taylor" plan to pacify South Vietnam within eighteen months. To carry out this "special war," from mid-1961 to mid-1965, the Kennedy and Johnson clique increased their forces in South Vietnam from several thousand U.S. "advisors" to ten thousand U.S. troops, aiming to annihilate the fledgling self-defense armed forces of the South Vietnamese people and realize their plot to invade South Vietnam.

However, the self-defense armed forces of South Vietnam, in their struggle against an enemy many times stronger in numbers and power, not only were not annihilated but grew and became stronger, developing into a liberation army with a scientific level of strategy and tactics capable of defeating the professional U.S. and puppet armies. From 1961 to October 1965, over four years of armed struggle, the armed forces of the South Vietnamese liberation army annihilated fifty-four thousand enemy troops and sixty battalions, destroyed six thousand out of eight thousand "strategic hamlets," and liberated four-fifths of South Vietnamese territory and ten million out of fourteen million people. In the war of aggression against South Vietnam, the puppet army, puppet government, and cities were no longer reliable allies for the U.S. military. The second stage of the U.S. counterattack using "special war" tactics ended in failure.

(3) After the failure of the "special war," the American bandits quickly sent more troops to South Vietnam, turning the "special war" into a "limited war." By the end of 1965, two hundred thousand U.S. expeditionary forces and more than fifty thousand puppet troops launched a "dry season strategic counteroffensive," aiming to annihilate part of the main forces of the South Vietnamese liberation army, forcing the South Vietnamese armed forces back to the stage of fighting only small-scale guerrilla wars, preparing conditions to annihilate the liberation army, and then annihilate the base of guerrilla warfare and people's warfare, restoring the old order of neo-colonialism. The U.S. imperialists' "dry season strategic counteroffensive" was smashed by the military and people of South Vietnam. Following this, the military and people of South Vietnam achieved great victories in the just-concluded rainy season. From October 1965 to October 1966, the armed forces of the South Vietnamese liberation army annihilated or disabled about three hundred thousand enemy troops, including one hundred twenty thousand U.S. aggressors.

This is a strategic victory achieved by the people of South Vietnam under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, i.e., defeating the first stage of the U.S. imperialists' limited war.

The great victories of the people of South Vietnam, combined with the strategic victories achieved by the military and people of North Vietnam in defeating the U.S. imperialists' war of destruction with air power, will create favorable conditions for us to achieve greater victories in the current fierce stage of the war and ultimately achieve the most glorious final victory.

In the process of achieving these three stages of great victories, the forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam have made a leap forward.

In terms of political struggle forces, patriots who were brutally persecuted in the enemy's six-year "anti-communist" and "annihilation of communists" campaigns have, in the face of the people's all-out struggle in South Vietnam, organized under the banner of the National Liberation Front into a force of one million people, playing a decisive role in the struggle to destroy and annihilate the enemy's village-level puppet governments and puppet troops.

The strength and influence of the rural political struggle forces have had a profound impact on the U.S. military and its lackeys, contributing to the promotion and development of urban political struggle forces. Currently, the political forces of the people have spread throughout the rural and urban areas of South Vietnam and are developing more rapidly than ever before.

The forces of armed struggle for liberation have rapidly grown from the many small self-defense armed forces at the height of the all-out struggle into a force capable of defeating the "new tactics" of the generals of the Pentagon, such as "helicopter transportation tactics," "amphibious armored vehicle tactics," and "flying phoenix tactics." They are not only capable of annihilating enemy troops in battalions but also in regiments; not only capable of defeating and disintegrating puppet troops but also capable of defeating the U.S. expeditionary forces.

The people of South Vietnam have launched frequent attacks on the enemy on both the military and political fronts, making the U.S. imperialists sink deeper and deeper into the sea of people's war. The political crisis of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys is deepening. Some of the U.S. "pacification campaigns" have already failed and are failing. Now, the liberated areas are expanding, and the anti-U.S. fronts in various places are tightly surrounding the U.S. strongholds and military bases, right up to the barbed wire outside their strongholds and bases. Moreover, outside these barbed wires are the liberated villages where self-governing committees exercising the functions of grassroots people's power have been established. We have distributed two million hectares of land to the peasants. Mutual aid teams and cooperatives have been formed. Many hospitals and schools have been established. The united and fighting people are speeding up production and bravely fighting.

The great victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam in the past prove that the line of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is correct. This is the victory of the line of people's war and strategy and tactics, and at the same time, it is the victory of a creative line and policy of struggle, which is: combining armed struggle with political struggle, and attacking from three sides: military, political, and logistics.

II. The National Liberation Front and the People of South Vietnam Have Sufficient Strength and Will Defeat the U.S. Imperialist Aggressors

In the past twelve years, the people of South Vietnam and their leader, the National Liberation Front, have achieved three strategic victories over the world's aggressor forces and the leader of colonialism, U.S. imperialism, which have already and are proving with historical practice that a small nation, though economically backward, but highly spiritually armed, with a correct military strategy and tactics line, can completely defeat a capitalist imperialist country that is many times stronger in economic and war potential.

Currently, U.S. imperialism is still unwilling to give up. It has increased its expeditionary forces in South Vietnam to three hundred eighty thousand and plans to increase them to five hundred thousand by the spring of 1967, aiming to form a force of millions of bandits together with five hundred thousand puppet troops, and to add one-third of the entire U.S. Navy and half of the tactical air force, to crush the one thousand four hundred thousand heroic people of South Vietnam.

Currently, the American bandits are beginning their second strategic counteroffensive plan for the 1966-1967 winter and spring, aiming to regain the initiative and reverse the failed situation. At the same time, they are intensifying the expansion of air and naval strikes and destruction against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, aiming to isolate the revolution in South Vietnam and paralyze the rear of the South Vietnamese battlefield. However, in the just-concluded period, the victories of the South Vietnamese liberation army in places like Xuan Loc, Quang Tri, Saigon, Bien Hoa, and Tam Ky have clearly revealed the extremely bleak future of the American bandits and their lackeys in this winter and spring and in the future.

The reason why the patriotic and just struggle of the people of South Vietnam under the leadership of the National Liberation Front is sure to win is based on the following achievements and factors:

(1) The sacred struggle of the people of South Vietnam for national salvation is just. The National Liberation Front, based on the high hatred and unity of the entire people, has launched and pushed this people's war to an extremely high level: every person is a soldier, every village is a fortress and a trench. The three types of troops are combined and reasonably used, the military and political struggles of the military and people are closely coordinated, and with continuous offensives, the U.S. military and their lackey troops, no matter how many they increase, are not enough to cope with the revolutionary forces. The U.S. military has been forced to fight on the battlefield arranged by the revolutionary armed forces and the people, according to the methods of the revolutionary armed forces. In this situation, they often suffer thunderous blows from the liberation army and guerrilla forces right in their nests.

Therefore, the more U.S. troops there are, the fewer there are; the stronger they become, the weaker they become; they want to concentrate but are forced to disperse; they want to rest but are forced to fight; they want to fight but cannot find a target; they are beaten during the day, beaten at night, beaten in front, and beaten from behind; they want to defend but cannot, and they are attacked and suffer flexible counterattacks from the armed forces of the South Vietnamese liberation.

(2) The people's war art of the National Liberation Front will definitely defeat the military art of U.S. imperialism.

The line of aggression and strategy of U.S. imperialism in Vietnam is completely incompatible with its objects of aggression and the battlefield. Between the strategy of quick victory and protracted war, it is in a dilemma of advance and retreat. In fact, its strategy has completely fallen into a stalemate. Its strategy of quick victory has suffered continuous failures. As for fighting a protracted war, the subjective conditions do not allow it, and the objective conditions are particularly unfavorable to it, and it has also suffered failures. For U.S. imperialism, the crisis of quick defeat is increasingly exposed. In terms of military strategy, it is also at a loss between attack and defense. Whether it is defense or attack, it is dangerous for it, and hesitation between attack and defense is also dangerous.

In terms of tactics, the so-called "helicopter tactics," "amphibious vehicle tactics" of U.S. imperialism, using firepower and mechanical superiority to encircle and annihilate the liberation armed forces, and other tricks have all been played out. However, under the slogan of "grab the American devils by the waist and fight," in the "see Americans and fight, see puppet troops and annihilate" campaign, the liberation army and guerrilla forces, with their high mobility, actively and flexibly give fierce blows to the American bandits, whether they are in defensive positions or outside defensive positions, on bases or on the march, thus controlling, restricting, or annihilating the enemy's strengths, such as aircraft, artillery, and mechanization, tightly surrounding and annihilating the cowardly American infantry.

(3) On the basis of high political awareness, high organizational level, and brilliant achievements, the National Liberation Front has established a vast liberated area system covering four-fifths of the land and three-quarters of the population of the South, as a steadily strengthening and powerful base, to mobilize manpower and material resources for the war of resistance, accelerate the awakening of the people in the enemy-occupied areas, and make them dare to rise up and attack from within and without, annihilating the American bandits and their lackeys in their nests.

(4) The vast rear of the South Vietnamese revolution—the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with strong national defense forces—is advancing on the road of socialist construction. This is an extremely reliable guarantee for the victory of the South Vietnamese revolution under the leadership of the National Liberation Front.

(5) The sympathy and support of the people of the world are a source of encouragement and an extremely important factor for the South Vietnamese revolution to achieve brilliant victories.

The revolutionary cause of the people of South Vietnam and the entire Vietnamese nation, shining with the light of justice, has received the sympathy and support of the great Chinese people, who are strong, share life and death, and stand in the same anti-U.S. trench with the Vietnamese people. It has also received the sympathy and support of the people of socialist countries and the people of the world who love freedom and peace. The great Chinese people, for the cause of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, have never shunned any sacrifice. It is this most resolute, most powerful, and most effective support of the Chinese people, together with the great assistance of other brother countries, that has made an active contribution to the brilliant achievements of the people of South Vietnam in the past six years and is also a strong encouraging force and important factor for the complete victory of the South Vietnamese revolution.

The people of South Vietnam are deeply grateful for the extremely precious sympathy and support of brothers and friends from the five continents and are determined to fulfill their glorious international duty—to defeat the U.S. imperialist aggressors and make active and practical contributions to the struggle of the people of the world for national independence, democracy, peace, and social progress.

The people of South Vietnam will surely win! The U.S. imperialists will surely fail!

    越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民光荣的胜利旗帜	越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代理团长　阮明芳
    六年前，一九六○年十二月二十日，越南南方民族解放阵线诞生了。这是具有极其重要意义的历史事件，它是越南南方人民不能再在美帝国主义及其走狗统治下继续生活，任何力量也不能阻挡他们奋起斗争的标志。这也说明，越南南方人民面对凶狠残暴的敌人，必须万众一心，加强团结，依靠群众和正义的伟大力量，以战胜敌人，并随时准备用革命暴力来反对反革命暴力。
    对于一个民族的历史来说，六年只是很短的一段时间。但是，在越南南方人民所进行的抗美救国神圣抗战事业中，每一时间都充满着光荣的胜利，写下了雄伟的历史篇章。
    一、越南南方人民在军事、政治斗争方面所取得的具有战略意义的胜利和跃进的步伐。
    美帝国主义在侵略越南南方十二年的三个战略阶段中，头两个战略阶段已经遭到完全的失败，而目前的第三个战略阶段，一开始就又遭到了沉重的失败。
      （一）首先，美帝国主义在取代了法国殖民者在越南南方的地位以后，就在越南南方扶植起吴庭艳走狗独裁政权和一支为数五十万人的雇佣军队，在西贡建立美军指挥部，直接指挥伪政权和伪军，并在“顾问”的幌子下把三万多名美军运进越南南方，把越南南方变成美国的新型殖民地和军事基地。但是，越南南方人民在民族解放阵线的正确领导下，以革命的政治暴力与武装斗争相结合，在局部游击战争的形式下，全面奋起捣毁“战略村”，同时在农村的广大地区分别起来，摧毁了拥有三十万伪军的吴庭艳法西斯制度的基础，建立了农村的革命政权，挫败了美帝国主义消灭南方革命力量的阴谋及其北进计划。
      （二）在头一阶段遭到失败后，肯尼迪、约翰逊政府气势汹汹地发动了一场“特种战争”，妄图实现在十八个月内平定越南南方的野心勃勃而又充满幻想的“斯特利—泰勒”计划。为了进行这场“特种战争”，从一九六一年年中至一九六五年年中，肯尼迪、约翰逊集团投入越南南方战场的力量，从几万美国“顾问”增加到十万美军，以与五十万南越伪军一起，妄图消灭南越人民仍然幼小的自卫武装力量，实现其侵略越南南方的阴谋。
    但是，南越人民的自卫武装力量，在同一个人数上比自己多和强大数倍的敌人进行较量的过程中，不仅没有被消灭，反而成长壮大，发展成为一支具有科学的战略战术水平，足以打败美伪职业军队的解放军。从一九六一年至一九六五年十月的四年武装战斗中，越南南方解放武装力量歼敌五十四万人和六十个营，捣毁敌人八千个“战略村”中的六千个，解放了南越土地的五分之四和一千四百万人口中的一千万人口。在对越南南方进行的侵略战争中，伪军、伪政权和城市再也不是美军可以信赖的依靠了。美帝国主义用“特种战争”进行的第二阶段反攻遭到了破产。
      （三）“特种战争”遭到失败后，美国强盗急忙增派军队到越南南方，把“特种战争”发展为“局部战争”。一九六五年底，二十万美国远征军和五十多万伪军发动了“旱季战略反攻”，妄图消灭越南南方解放武装力量的部分主力，迫使越南南方武装力量回到只能打小规模游击战争的阶段，以便为消灭解放武装力量准备条件，进而消灭游击战争、人民战争的基础，重建新殖民主义制度的旧秩序。美帝国主义的“旱季战略反攻”被越南南方军民粉碎了。接着，越南南方军民在刚刚过去的雨季里，连续取得了很大的胜利。从一九六五年十月至一九六六年十月，越南南方解放武装力量消灭或使之丧失战斗力的敌人约三十万人，其中包括十二万美国侵略军。
    这是越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线领导下取得的具有战略意义的胜利，即打败了美帝国主义局部战争的第一阶段。
    越南南方人民的伟大胜利，同越南北方军民在打败美帝国主义以空军进行的破坏性战争中所取得的具有战略意义的胜利相互配合，必将创造有利的条件，使我们能够在现阶段的激烈战争中，赢得更大的胜利，并将进而取得极其光荣的最后胜利。
    在取得上述三个阶段的伟大胜利过程中，越南南方民族解放阵线的力量有了飞跃的发展。
    在政治斗争力量方面，在敌人连续六年的“控共”、“灭共”运动中被野蛮迫害的爱国者，已在南方人民全面奋起斗争前后，在民族解放阵线的旗帜下组织成为一支百万人的队伍，在破坏和消灭敌人的村一级伪政权和伪军的斗争中，起着决定性的作用。
    农村政治斗争队伍的力量和影响，对美军及其走狗内部产生了深刻的作用，对促进和发展城市的政治斗争力量作出了贡献。目前，人民群众的政治力量已经遍及越南南方农村和城市，并比过去任何时候都发展得更为迅猛。
    解放武装斗争力量，已从最初全面奋起斗争的高潮时期的许多幼小武装自卫力量迅速成长起来，能够打败五角大楼的将军们诸如“直升飞机运输战术”、“两栖装甲车战术”、“飞行凤凰战术”等等“新战术”。不仅能够成营地全歼敌军，并且能够成团成团地全歼敌军；不仅能打败和瓦解伪军，并且也打败美国远征军。
    越南南方人民在军事和政治两条战线上对敌人发动了频繁的进攻，使美帝国主义日益深陷在人民战争的火海里。美帝国主义及其走狗的政治危机日益深刻。美国的一些“绥靖战役”已经和正在遭到失败。现在，解放区日益扩大，各地的歼美战线，正在紧紧包围着美国的据点和军事基地，一直紧迫到他们据点和基地周围的铁丝网外边，而且，在这些铁丝网外边，就是那些已经建立了行使基层人民政权职能的自管委员会的解放乡村。我们已把二百万公顷田地分给了农民。变工队、互助组成立起来了。许多医院、学校建立起来了。奋发团结的人民，正在加紧生产和英勇战斗。
    越南南方人民过去获得的巨大胜利，证明越南南方民族解放阵线的路线是正确的。这是人民战争路线和战略、战术的胜利，同时也是充满创造性的斗争路线、方针的胜利，这就是：武装斗争与政治斗争相结合，军事、政治和兵运三面夹攻。
    二、民族解放阵线和越南南方人民拥有足够的力量，并且必将战胜美帝国主义侵略者。
    在过去十二年中，越南南方人民及其领导者民族解放阵线，对世界侵略势力和殖民主义的魁首美帝国主义所取得的具有战略意义的三次胜利，已经和正在以其历史实践证明：一个只有落后经济但却是以高度精神武装起来的，拥有正确军事战略、战术路线的弱小民族，完全可以打败一个在经济和战争潜力方面比自己不知强大几倍的资本帝国主义国家。
    目前，美帝国主义仍然不甘愿罢手。它已把在越南南方的远征军增加至三十八万人，并预定在一九六七年春天增至五十万人，以便连同五十万伪军，组成一支为数百万的强盗军队，妄图加上整个美国海军的三分之一，战术空军的二分之一，压倒一千四百万英雄的越南南方人民。
    目前，美国强盗正在一九六六——一九六七年冬春，开始它的第二次战略反攻计划，企图重新夺回主动，扭转深陷泥淖的失败局面。与此同时，它加紧扩大以空军和海军对越南民主共和国进行轰击、破坏的战争，妄图使越南南方的革命陷于孤立，使越南南方战场的大后方陷于瘫痪。但是，在刚刚过去的这段时间，越南南方解放武装力量在西宁、广治、西贡、边和、三岐等地的威震远近的胜利，已经清楚地揭示了美国强盗及其走狗在这个冬春和在今后的极其黑漆的前途。
    在民族解放阵线领导下的越南南方人民的爱国正义斗争之所以必定胜利，是建立在下列各方面的成就和因素之上的：
      （一）越南南方人民神圣的救国抗战是正义的。民族解放阵线在全体人民高度的仇恨和团结战斗决心基础上，发动并把这场人民战争推上了一个极高的水平：每一个人是一个战士，每一个村庄是一座炮台和战壕。三种部队互相结合和合理使用，军民之间的军事斗争和政治斗争紧密配合，并以连续不断的攻势，使美国军队及其走狗军队无论增多到任何程度，也不足以对付革命力量。对于游击队、地方部队和解放军，美军已被迫按照革命武装力量的打法，在革命武装力量和人民摆布好的战场上打仗。在这种情况下，他们经常遭到解放军和游击队直捣他们巢穴的雷霆万钧的打击。
    正因此，美国军队虽多犹少，由强变弱；想要集中，但被迫分散；想要休息，但又被迫战斗；想要作战，但又找不到对象；日挨打，夜挨打，前挨打，后挨打，想固守也不行，进攻则又遭到越南南方解放武装力量主动、灵活的回击。
      （二）民族解放阵线的人民战争艺术必将战胜美帝国主义的军事艺术。
    美帝国主义在越南的侵略战争路线和战略，与它的侵略对象和战场完全不适应。在速战速胜战略和持久战之间，它已经处于进退维谷的地步。实际上，它的战略已经完全陷于僵局了。它的速战速胜的战略，已经连续遭到了失败。而打持久战则主观条件又不容许，客观条件对它尤其不利，并且仍然遭到了失败。对于美帝国主义，速败的危机已日益暴露了。在军事战略方面，它也是在进攻与防御之间不知所措。无论防御或进攻，对于它都是危险的，而在进攻与防御之间犹疑不决，也是危险的。
    在战术方面，美帝国主义的所谓“直升飞机战术”、“两栖战车战术”、用火力优势和机械优势进行包围，以消灭解放武装力量等种种手法，都已耍弄出来了。但是，在“揪住美国鬼子腰带打”的口号下，在
  “见美国佬就打，见伪军就歼”的杀敌运动中，解放军、游击队以自己高度的机动性，主动、灵活地不断给予不管在防御工事里或防御工事外，在基地上还是在行军途中的美国强盗以猛烈打击，从而控制、限制或消灭了敌人的所长，例如飞机、大炮、机械化等，把贪生怕死的美国步兵紧紧包围而予以消灭。
      （三）在政治觉悟高、组织程度高和战绩辉煌等基础上，民族解放阵线已建立了一个拥有南方五分之四土地和四分之三人口的广大解放区体系，作为日益巩固和强大的基地，以动员人力物力投入抗战，加速敌占区人民的觉悟，使他们敢于起来配合，内外夹攻，把美国强盗及其走狗消灭在他们的巢穴里。
      （四）南方革命的广大后方——拥有强大国防力量的越南民主共和国，正在社会主义建设道路上不断前进。这是越南南方民族解放阵线领导下的越南南方革命必胜的极其可靠的保证。
      （五）世界人民的同情和支持，是对越南南方革命取得辉煌胜利作出贡献的鼓舞源泉和极其重要因素。
    越南南方人民和整个越南民族迸射着正义光芒的革命事业，得到强大的，生死与共的，与越南人民站在同一反美战壕里的战友——中国人民的同情和支持，得到社会主义各国人民，世界上爱好自由、和平的人民的同情和支持。伟大的中国人民为了越南的抗美救国事业，从来不辞任何牺牲。正是中国人民这种最坚决、最有力和最有效的支持，与其它兄弟国家的巨大援助，为过去六年越南南方人民所取得的辉煌成就作出了积极的贡献，同时也是使越南南方革命取得完全胜利的强大鼓舞力量和重要因素。
    越南南方人民无比感谢五大洲兄弟和朋友们的极其宝贵的同情和支持，决心完成自己光荣的国际义务——打败美帝国主义侵略者，对世界人民为民族独立、民主、和平和社会进步而进行的斗争作出积极、切实的贡献。
    越南南方人民必胜！美帝必败！
