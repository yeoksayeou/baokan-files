	Strictly Adhere to the Disciplines Formulated by Chairman Mao

	Take the Path or the Highway?

	The incident occurred in the Second Platoon, Fifth Squad.

	One day, the students were indeed very tired from walking, and they really wanted to reach their destination as soon as possible. Ahead of them appeared a small path cutting through a field of crops, leading to the village ahead. The path was much shorter than the main road.

	Should they take the path or the highway?

	Some said, "The path is shorter, let's take the path!" Others said, "We can't take the path, we can't trample the crops!"

	At this moment, a student said, "Let's study together the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention personally formulated by Chairman Mao! ... (Six) Do not damage crops ..."

	"Right! Do not damage crops, follow the disciplines, we will take the highway!" Everyone said in unison, happily walking towards the highway...

	Later, whenever the students mentioned this incident, they would say meaningfully, "We almost infringed on the interests of the masses; in the future, we must always follow Chairman Mao's teachings!"

	This is not just a matter of a needle!

	While staying in Guan Tao County, Hebei Province, a student lost the needle of the landlady. Initially, he thought that a needle was not a big deal. However, when he remembered the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention formulated by Chairman Mao, which include "Return borrowed items," he immediately changed his mind. He thought, "If I just let it go, this is not just a matter of a needle, but more importantly, it is a violation of Chairman Mao's teachings." He then borrowed a needle from a classmate and returned it to the landlady.

	A needle is indeed a small matter, but the high level of organization and discipline of a team is often reflected in these ordinary small matters.

	Send the money back immediately!

	While crossing the White Lake ferry, the Third Squad of the First Platoon paid five jiao less to the boatman due to a misunderstanding. The situation was as follows: the students of the Third Squad were divided into two small boats to cross the ferry. The first boat carried ten people, and the second boat carried fifteen people. The students on the first boat thought that the squad leader on the second boat would definitely pay the money to the boatman, so they got off the boat and left first. However, the students on the second boat thought that the students on the first boat had already paid the boatman, so they only paid for fifteen people and left.

	They had already walked more than a hundred miles out of White Lake. For some reason, the students started talking about the boat ride again, and everyone explained the situation, realizing that they had paid five jiao less to the boatman. What should they do? Should they send a student to deliver the money? This way, the student delivering the money would fall behind; should they wait until they return to White Lake to pay the boatman? That would not be good either, as the time interval would be too long.

	Just as everyone was at a loss, a student suggested, "Send the money back immediately!" Everyone agreed with this suggestion and immediately wrote a letter of apology, along with five jiao, and sent it back.

### 严格遵守毛主席制订的纪律

    严格遵守毛主席制订的纪律
    走小道，还是走大路？
    事情发生在二中队五分队。
    一天，同学们走得确实很累了，多么想早点儿到达目的地啊！眼前出现了一条斜穿麦田的小道，到达前面的村子，小道要比大路近得多。
    走小道呢，还是走大路呢？
    有的说：“小道近，走小道！”有的说：“不能走小道，不能踩庄稼！”
    这时，一个同学说：“让我们共同学习毛主席亲自制订的三大纪律八项注意吧！……（六）不损坏庄稼……”。
      “对！不损坏庄稼，遵守纪律，我们走大路！”大家异口同声地说着，愉快地朝着大路走去……
    事后，同学们一提起这件事，都意味深长地说：“差一点侵犯了群众的利益；今后我们一定要事事对照毛主席的教导啊！”
      这不只是一根针的问题！
    在河北省馆陶县住宿的时候，有一个同学把房东大娘的一根针丢失了。开始，他觉得一根针不是什么大事。可是，当他想起毛主席制订的三大纪律八项注意中的“借东西要还”时，马上把原来的想法推翻了。他想：“如果就此算了，这绝不仅是一根针的问题，更重要的是违反了毛主席的教导。”他便向同学借了一根针，还给了老大娘。
    一根针固然是小事，但一个队伍的高度的组织性和纪律性，却往往要从这些平凡的小事中体现出来。
      马上把钱寄回去！
    在过白洋淀渡口的时候，一中队三分队的同学由于误会，少付给船工五角钱。事情的经过是这样的：三分队的同学分乘两只小船过渡口，第一只船坐十人，第二只船坐十五人。第一只船上的同学以为分队长坐在后边的船上，一定会把钱统一付给船工，所以下船后就先走了。可是，第二只船上的同学又以为，第一只船上的同学已经把钱付给船工了，所以只付了十五个人的船钱就走了。
    已经走出白洋淀一百多里路了。不知怎的，同学们又谈起坐船的事，大家把情况一说，才知道少付给船工五角钱。怎么办呢？派个同学把钱送回去吧？这样，送钱的同学就要掉队；等回来的时候到白洋淀再把钱补付给船工吧？也不好，那样，相隔的时间太长了。
    大家正在为难的时候，一个同学提议：“马上把钱寄回去！”大家一致同意这个意见，马上写了一封表示歉意的信，连同五角钱一起寄去了。　河南省清丰一中“继红长征队”
