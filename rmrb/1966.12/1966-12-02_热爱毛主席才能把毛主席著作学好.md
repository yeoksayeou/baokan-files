Officers of a certain division and regiment in Guangzhou Military Region have launched activities to recall past hardships, compare present conditions, and discuss the sweetness of the past, which has ignited their boundless class love for the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They have more consciously led the masses to push the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 1st: To push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, it is necessary to raise the level of understanding to a new height. The Party Committee of a certain division in the Guangzhou Military Region organized division and regiment leaders to engage in activities of recalling past hardships, comparing present conditions, and discussing the sweetness of the past while studying Comrade Lin Biao's instructions. This has ignited their deep class love for the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and they have more consciously led the masses to place the study of Chairman Mao's works in the highest position, achieving new situations and new levels of application.

Since receiving Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, in addition to organizing cadres and soldiers to study them word by word and understand their spirit, the division Party Committee has also generally reviewed the past situations of studying Chairman Mao's works, summarized experiences, and found gaps. The Party Committee recognized from the summary that the deeper the class feelings of the leaders towards Chairman Mao and his works, the better the study. To truly implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, it is first necessary to raise the leaders' class feelings towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought to an extremely deep level. Therefore, the Party Committee decided to launch activities of recalling past hardships, comparing present conditions, and discussing the sweetness of the past among the leading cadres.

Among the division and regiment leaders, there was initially some lack of understanding about whether to carry out such activities. They said: "We joined the revolutionary army with empty stomachs, wearing sacks, and with hatred in our hearts, unlike the young soldiers in the platoons who do not know what hardship is like and easily forget their roots." "After participating in the revolution for more than twenty years, we have been educated by the Party and Chairman Mao for a long time, experiencing all kinds of hardships, seeing all kinds of scenes, and enduring all kinds of dangers. How could we forget our roots?" "The past hardships are remembered in our hearts, so why bring them up again?" On one hand, the Party Committee organized everyone to deeply study Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, clarifying that in the new situation, there are new and higher requirements for the thought revolutionization of leading cadres. On the other hand, they let everyone use "Three Articles" as a weapon, use "completely" and "thoroughly" as a measure, and use heroic figures as examples for comparison and self-examination, to see if their red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is held high, if politics are prominent, and if revolutionary enthusiasm is sufficient. Everyone linked their thoughts, actual situations, and work to find gaps and re-recognize themselves. Many comrades recalled the past, saying: In the war years, carrying luggage and shouldering big guns, no matter how many miles we walked or how many battles we fought, we did not complain of hardship or fatigue. Why? Because we had class enemies in our minds and did not forget the blood and tears of our hatred; because we loved Chairman Mao deeply, we also hated the enemy deeply. Everyone agreed that the higher the position of the leading cadres, the more they need a strong class struggle consciousness, and the more they need to often recall and compare, and discuss the sweetness of the past, so as to have deep class feelings towards Chairman Mao and his works.

During the recalling hardships activity, the division and regiment leaders, with deep hatred for the class enemies, with one sentence and a tear, denounced the heinous crimes of the old society. Some were only one year old when their parents starved to death; some were imprisoned at the age of twelve and had not worn a pair of pants by the age of thirteen. Everyone said: The bitterness of the class and the hatred of the nation, we will never forget, and we will definitely repay the blood debt with blood. At the same time, everyone, with boundless love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao, expressed their deep class feelings of gratitude to Chairman Mao for saving them from the fire, for nurturing them to adulthood, and for cultivating them into leaders of the people's army. Everyone said with tears: Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao. Deputy Political Commissar Liu Zhiming, in the old society, was raised by his mother begging along the road, and at the age of twelve, he worked for the landlord and was tortured to the point of being skin and bones, unable to live, so at the age of thirteen, he joined the army with an empty stomach. At the recalling hardships meeting, he was extremely moved and angrily denounced the old society, then with a heart full of gratitude, said: "It was the revolutionary army created by Chairman Mao that raised me, I was young and weak, old comrades and old leaders carried me on marches, carried me across blockade lines; it was Chairman Mao's teachings that made me understand revolutionary principles, and it was the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought that made me grow continuously. From head to toe, from inside to outside, there is not a single point that is not given by Chairman Mao, and there is not a single point that can be separated from Mao Zedong Thought."

In the process of recalling and comparing, everyone linked their actual situations, and many people felt that their every move had not been able to completely follow Chairman Mao's words, and their every word and deed had not been able to completely conform to Mao Zedong Thought, feeling very heavy-hearted and ashamed. Division Chief of Staff Zhang Defu said: "After joining the army, old comrades and old leaders, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, raised my class consciousness, so I did not forget the tragic scene of my father starving to death by the roadside and my mother leading me to beg for food, did not forget that there are still many laboring people who have not been liberated, did not forget class oppression and class exploitation. Therefore, in peacetime, I was not afraid of hardship or fatigue, and I treated comrades like brothers; in wartime, I was full of hatred and charged into battle, with bayonets drawn. Now, as a leading cadre, I have not been able to lead the troops well according to Chairman Mao's teachings, like the old comrades and old leaders educated me in the past. Sometimes, I am still influenced by the bourgeois military viewpoint. These thoughts make me more and more painful."

Through recalling and comparing, and discussing the sweetness of the past, these leading cadres have undergone significant changes in their spiritual appearance. Those who were previously active in studying Chairman Mao's works have even more enthusiasm, and their determination for self-revolution is even stronger; those who were previously insufficient in self-reform have actively exposed their thoughts and eliminated private interests to establish public interests. They have all expressed their determination to follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, to quickly push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and to truly make the army a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 热爱毛主席才能把毛主席著作学好

    热爱毛主席才能把毛主席著作学好
    广州部队某师师团干部开展回忆对比、谈甜思源活动，焕发了大家对伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想无限热爱的阶级感情，更加自觉地带领群众把活学活用毛主席著作运动推向新高潮
    新华社广州一日电　要把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段，首先要把认识提高到一个新的高度。中国人民解放军广州部队某师党委在学习林彪同志的指示时，组织师团领导干部，大搞回忆对比、谈甜思源的活动，焕发了大家对伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想无限热爱的深厚的阶级感情，更加自觉地带领群众把学习毛主席著作摆在高于一切的位置上，学出新局面，用出新水平。
    这个师党委从接到林彪同志的指示以来，除了组织干部和战士逐字逐句学习，领会精神实质以外，还普遍回顾过去学习毛主席著作的情况，总结经验，找出差距。师党委从总结中认识到：哪个单位的领导对毛主席和毛主席著作的阶级感情深，那个单位就学得好。要使林彪同志的指示真正落实，首先必须提高领导干部对毛主席和对毛泽东思想的无比深厚的阶级感情。因此，党委决定在领导干部中大搞回忆对比、谈甜思源的活动。
    在师团领导干部中，要不要开展这种活动？开始，有些人认识不足。他们说：“我们是饿着肚子，披着麻袋，怀着仇恨参加革命部队的，不像连队里那些小青年，不知道苦是什么滋味，容易忘本。”“参加革命二十多年，受到党和毛主席的长期教育，什么风霜都经过了，什么世面都见过了，什么艰险都熬过了，怎么会忘本？”“过去的苦记在心里就行了，还老提它干啥？”党委一方面组织大家深入学习林彪同志的指示，明确在新的形势下对领导干部思想革命化，提出了更新更高的要求；另一方面又让大家以“老三篇”为武器，以“完全”“彻底”为尺子，以英雄人物为榜样对照检查，看一看自己毛泽东思想红旗举得高不高，突出政治好不好，革命干劲足不足？大家联系思想、联系实际、联系工作找出了差距，重新认识了自己。许多同志回忆过去时说：在战争年代，背着行李，扛着大枪，走再多的路，打再多的仗，不叫一声苦，不喊一声累，要冲就冲，要死就死。为什么？因为头脑里有阶级敌人，没有忘记血泪仇；因为对毛主席爱得深，也就对敌人恨得深。大家一致认为，越是领导干部，职位越高，越要有坚强的阶级斗争观念，越要经常回忆对比，谈甜思源，这样才能对毛主席和毛主席著作有深厚的阶级感情。
    在忆苦活动中，师团领导干部们怀着对阶级敌人刻骨的仇恨，一句话，一把泪，控诉了旧社会的滔天罪行。有的刚满一周岁，父母亲就饿死了；有的十二岁就被关进监牢，十三岁还没有穿过一条裤子。大家说：阶级苦、民族恨，我们永世不能忘，血债一定要用血来还。同时，大家又怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的深厚的阶级感情，万分感谢毛主席把自己从火海里拯救了出来；万分感激毛主席把自己哺育成人，万分感激毛主席把自己培养成人民军队的领导干部。大家含着热泪说：爹亲娘亲没有毛主席亲。师副政委刘智民在旧社会是母亲沿路乞讨把他养活的，十二岁给地主扛活，被折磨得皮包骨，活不下去了，十三岁就饿着肚子参军。在忆苦会上，他心情万分激动，悲愤地控诉了旧社会，然后，又以万分感激的心情说：“是毛主席亲手缔造的革命军队把我拉扯大的，我年小身体弱，老同志、老首长背我行军，背我通过封锁线；是毛主席的教导，我才懂得了革命道理，是毛泽东思想的哺育，我才不断地成长。我从头到脚，从里到外，那一点不是毛主席给的，那一点离得开毛泽东思想。”
    在回忆对比的过程中，大家联系了自己的实际情况，许多人感到自己的一举一动还没有能够完全按照毛主席的话去做，一言一行还没有能够完全符合毛泽东思想，心情十分沉重，万分惭愧。师参谋长张德福说：“参军以后，老首长，老同志就按照毛主席的教导，提高了我的无产阶级觉悟，使我没有忘记父亲饿死路旁，母亲领我讨饭时的悲惨情景，没有忘记还有许多劳动人民没有翻身解放，没有忘记阶级压迫和阶级剥削。所以，在平时，不怕苦，不怕累，对同志亲如手足；在战时，满怀仇恨冲锋陷阵，刺刀见红。现在，当了领导干部，就没有很好地像当年老首长、老同志教育自己那样，按照毛主席的教导去带好部队，有时还受到资产阶级单纯军事观点的影响。这些，越想越痛心。”
    通过回忆对比，谈甜思源，这些领导干部精神面貌发生了显著变化。过去是学习毛主席著作的积极分子，劲头更大了，自我革命的决心更足了；过去在思想改造上狠下功夫不够的人，主动亮思想，破私立公。他们纷纷表示要坚决遵循林彪同志的指示，带领全体指战员迅速把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段，把部队真正办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
