Follow the Path Indicated by Mao Zedong!
— Asian, African, and Latin American Students in the Soviet Union Deeply Love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought

Recently, all Chinese students who were unjustly ordered to return to China by the Soviet government shared with reporters their deep friendships with students from over 50 countries and regions, most of whom were revolutionary students from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. When these Chinese students recalled their experiences with Asian, African, and Latin American students during their time in the Soviet Union, and when they spoke of the various scenes of these students' deep love for our great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, their emotions were extremely stirred.

Under the fascist rule of the modern revisionist leadership in the Soviet Union, even a foreign student who showed love and respect for our great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought would face various difficulties in their studies and life, and political persecution. However, even in such circumstances, the Soviet authorities could not change the direction of people's hearts. On the contrary, the more they intensified their persecution, the more people yearned for the center of the world revolution, Beijing, and for Chairman Mao.

To Chairman Mao, greetings! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!

Many Asian, African, and Latin American friends, in today's Soviet Union, often became extremely excited and overjoyed when they could obtain a portrait of Chairman Mao, a Mao badge, or a book by Chairman Mao. Despite the obstruction and persecution by the Soviet revisionist leadership, they hung Chairman Mao's portrait high in their dormitories, placed Chairman Mao's books on their shelves, and wore Mao badges on their chests. Once, an African student obtained a Mao badge and was overjoyed, proudly wearing it on his chest. A Soviet revisionist challenged him, "Why are you wearing a Mao Zedong badge?" The African student replied confidently, "Because Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the greatest leader of all revolutionary people in the world!"

During their time in the Soviet Union, many Asian, African, and Latin American students often proactively sought out Chinese students, asking them to teach them to sing the most inspiring songs, "The East Is Red" and "The Boat Sails with the Helm." At some gatherings with friends from various countries, foreign friends often proposed that everyone sing "The East Is Red" together. On the eve of China's National Day this year, an African student wrote a passionate letter and enclosed a precious gift, asking Chinese students to deliver it to Chairman Mao to express his deep love and respect. After the joyous news of Chairman Mao's swim in the Yangtze River reached the Soviet Union, Asian, African, and Latin American students were overjoyed and rushed to congratulate Chinese students, requesting photos of Chairman Mao swimming. They said, "Chairman Mao's health is the greatest happiness for all revolutionary people in the world!"

When Chinese students were forced to leave the Soviet Union, many Asian, African, and Latin American revolutionary students came to see them off. With tears in their eyes, they tightly held the hands of Chinese students, repeatedly saying excitedly, "When you return to Beijing, please remember to greet Chairman Mao on our behalf and wish Chairman Mao eternal life!"

Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible weapon; we must study it and master it.

Many Asian, African, and Latin American students initially went to the Soviet Union with a strong desire to learn revolutionary experience. However, what they saw in today's Soviet Union, where the modern revisionist leadership is in power, made them greatly disappointed. From their personal experiences, they more deeply realized that the hope of the world revolution lies in Beijing, and that the great Mao Zedong Thought is the truth that oppressed people rely on to stand up!

A Vietnamese student said, "Mao Zedong Thought not only guides our heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation but is also the highest directive for the entire world revolution!"

An Asian student said, "Comrade Mao Zedong's works contain the deepest and most genuine truths. No one else in the world today can write such brilliant works."

An African student said, "Mao Zedong Thought is our guiding light. To make a revolution, one must read Mao Zedong's books!"

In today's Soviet Union, it is so difficult to find a book by Chairman Mao! Many Asian, African, and Latin American students spent over two years searching for a book by Chairman Mao. Some, unable to buy Mao's books in the Soviet Union, had to ask someone to bring them from Paris, France. Sometimes, Chinese students, moved by the eager wishes of their Asian, African, and Latin American friends, gave them their own copies of Chairman Mao's books for study. They were overjoyed, saying, "My greatest wish for years has been fulfilled. This is the most precious gift you have given me!" Some even held Mao's books high above their heads, excitedly shouting, "This is the most precious spiritual nourishment, an invincible weapon. Studying it and mastering it is more important than eating!"

Once, an African student came to a Chinese student's dormitory to chat. He saw a copy of "Selected Military Works of Mao Zedong," flipped through it for a long time, and couldn't put it down. When our student decided to give the book to him, he was overjoyed, saying, "Thank you, thank you! Let us achieve great success together in studying Mao Zedong's works!"

The Asian, African, and Latin American revolutionary students' love for Mao Zedong Thought made the Soviet revisionist leadership, who fear the truth and fear revolution, extremely anxious. They used various despicable means to try to stop the spread of Mao Zedong Thought. They used both soft and hard tactics, threatening and bribing Asian, African, and Latin American students to keep them from getting close to Chinese students. They threatened to stop scholarships and expel students from school to prevent Asian, African, and Latin American students from reading Chairman Mao's books. They even shamelessly sent people to search Asian, African, and Latin American students' dormitories, stealing or seizing their books by Chairman Mao. However, the Asian, African, and Latin American revolutionary students fearlessly said to the Soviet authorities, "You can take everything, but you cannot take away Chairman Mao's books." "You can expel me! What is important to me is not getting a diploma but mastering the weapon of struggle, which is Mao Zedong Thought!"

Bringing their own ideological questions and issues from their countries' revolutionary struggles, they actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

Foreign students studying in the Soviet Union also voluntarily organized many study groups for Mao Zedong's works, frequently holding study and discussion meetings. In their studies, they carefully read Chairman Mao's works, marked important points, took notes, wrote reflections, and actively applied what they learned to their own ideological and national struggles. They said, "We must master Mao Zedong Thought and follow the path indicated by Mao Zedong!"

An African student brought his own ideological and national revolutionary struggle issues, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and wrote over 300 pages of reading notes and reflections. Another Asian student applied Chairman Mao's views on class, contradictions, and class struggle to analyze the class struggle situation in his own country, writing a tens-of-thousands-word article. They deeply felt that using Comrade Mao Zedong's theories on class struggle and the theory of contradictions to observe problems could help them see clearly what is Marxism-Leninism and what is revisionism.

A Latin American student said, "Comrade Mao Zedong's theories on armed struggle and guerrilla warfare are extremely brilliant revolutionary theories. The guerrillas in my country all love to read Comrade Mao Zedong's military works and draw great strength from them." Another student also said, "The history of my country proves that without arming the people, it is impossible to seize power. Comrade Mao Zedong's assertion that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' is extremely correct and wise."

An Indian student sincerely hoped that Chinese students could find him a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," saying, "I have already read more than a dozen of Comrade Mao Zedong's military works. He is absolutely right, and his analysis is completely correct. I am extremely in need of reading other works by Comrade Mao Zedong. No matter what, you must find me a copy of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong'!"

After serious study, many Asian, African, and Latin American revolutionary students were able to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide their struggles and lives. In the bloody suppression by the Soviet revisionist leadership of the anti-American and pro-Vietnam demonstrations by Asian, African, and Latin American students in Moscow, Asian, African, and Latin American students, together with Chinese students, shed blood on the streets of Moscow and suffered brutal persecution from the Soviet revisionist leadership. Many Asian, African, and Latin American students quoted Chairman Mao's words in their struggles, saying, "'Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again... until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause, and they will never deviate from this logic.' The Soviet revisionist leadership is so arrogant in suppressing the revolutionary actions of students from various countries, serving American imperialism. They will also never deviate from this logic." In the struggle, the Soviet revisionist leadership forced an African student to participate in anti-China activities, but he firmly refused. The Soviet revisionist leadership then instigated thugs to beat him, leaving him covered in bruises, and fabricated reasons to expel him. This African student indignantly said, "The more they persecute me like this, the more I recognize their reactionary nature. Chairman Mao said, 'Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing.' The more they oppose me, the more I know I am right!"

No matter how frantically the Soviet revisionist leadership opposes China, they cannot drive the great Mao Zedong Thought from the hearts of revolutionary people.

Many Asian, African, and Latin American revolutionary students also strictly demanded of themselves in their daily lives, determined to temper their revolutionary will according to Chairman Mao's teachings. They washed their own clothes when they were dirty and mended them when they were torn, borrowing needles and thread from Chinese students to learn sewing. They said, "Comrade Mao Zedong teaches Chinese students to maintain a frugal and hardworking lifestyle. We must learn from Chinese students and bring this spirit back to our comrades when we return." During the summer vacation, the Soviet authorities arranged for some foreign students to go to the southern part of the Soviet Union for a vacation. However, some Asian, African, and Latin American revolutionary students voluntarily proposed to go to factories and rural areas to engage in physical labor, get close to the workers and peasants, and did not want to go to the south for a vacation. They said, "Going there would mean just eating, sleeping, and sunbathing all day, which would erode our revolutionary will over time!"

Such moving examples are too numerous to list. Now that Chinese students who have returned to the country recall these moving examples, they feel deeply educated and miss their Asian, African, and Latin American comrades they met during their time in the Soviet Union. They said that when they left the Soviet Union, many Asian, African, and Latin American revolutionary students had said the same words to Chinese students, which they would never forget. At that time, many Asian, African, and Latin American comrades had tightly held their hands, saying, "No matter how frantically the Soviet revisionist leadership opposes China, they cannot drive the great Mao Zedong Thought from the hearts of revolutionary people!"

    走毛泽东给我们指出的道路！
    ——亚非拉留苏学生无限热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想
    不久前被苏联政府无理勒令回国的我国全体留苏学生，在苏联学习期间，结识了来自世界五十多个国家和地区的外国留学生，其中大多数是来自亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的革命学生。最近，当我国留苏学生向记者谈到他们在苏联期间同亚非拉学生结下的深厚友谊的时候，当他们谈到亚非拉学生无限热爱我们伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想的种种情景的时候，心情都非常激动。
    在苏联现代修正主义领导集团的法西斯统治下，即使是一个外国留学生，如果表现出对我们伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想的热爱和崇敬，他在学习上和生活上就将受到种种刁难，在政治上就将受到种种迫害。但是，就是在这种情况下，苏联当局也丝毫改变不了人心之所向。相反地，他们越是加紧迫害，人们越是向往世界革命的中心北京，向往毛主席。
    向毛主席问好，祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    许多亚非拉朋友，在今日苏联那样的环境中，常常因为自己能够得到一幅毛主席画像，一枚毛主席像章，或者一本毛主席著作，而激动万分，欣喜若狂。他们不顾苏联修正主义领导集团的阻挠和迫害，把毛主席画像高高挂在自己的宿舍里，把毛主席著作放在书架上，把毛主席像章别在胸前。有一次，一位非洲学生得到了一枚毛主席像章，他高兴异常，兴高采烈地别在胸前。一个苏联修正主义分子挑衅性地问他：“你为什么要戴毛泽东像章？”这个非洲学生理直气壮地说：“因为毛泽东是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是全世界革命人民最伟大的领袖！”
    我国留苏学生在苏联学习期间，许多亚非拉学生经常主动地去找他们，请他们教唱世界上最激动人心的颂歌《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》。在一些有各国朋友参加的联欢会上，外国朋友经常提议，大家都来放声高歌一曲《东方红》。今年我国国庆前夕，一位非洲学生写了一封热情洋溢的信，还附上一份珍贵的礼物，要求中国学生转交给毛主席，以表达他对毛主席的无限热爱和崇敬。我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席畅游长江的喜讯传到苏联以后，亚非拉留学生们高兴极了，纷纷跑来向中国学生祝贺，要求送给他们毛主席游泳的照片。他们说：“毛主席的健康，就是我们全世界革命人民的最大幸福！”
    当我国留苏学生被迫离开苏联的时候，许多亚非拉革命学生纷纷赶来送行。他们含着眼泪，紧握着我国学生的双手，一再激动地说：“回到北京以后，请千万不要忘记代我们向毛主席问好，祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
      毛泽东思想是战无不胜的武器，要学习它，掌握它
    很多亚非拉学生，当初曾经抱着学习革命经验的强烈愿望去苏联。但是，他们从现代修正主义领导集团当权的今日苏联所见到的一切，使得他们大失所望了。他们从这种切身的经历中更加深刻地体会到：如今世界革命的希望在北京，伟大的毛泽东思想才是被压迫人民闹翻身的真理！
    一位越南学生说：“毛泽东思想不仅指导着我们英雄的越南人民的抗美救国斗争，而且是整个世界革命的最高指针！”
    一位亚洲学生说：“毛泽东同志的著作包含着最深刻、最真切的真理，当今世界上还没有第二个人能写出这样光辉的著作。”
    一位非洲学生说：“毛泽东思想是我们的指路明灯，要革命就必须读毛泽东的书！”
    在今天的苏联，要想找到一本毛主席著作是多么地不容易啊！许多亚非拉学生，有的人为了找到一本毛主席著作，整整花了两年多的时间。有的人在苏联买不到毛主席著作，却只好托人远道从法国的巴黎带来。有时候，中国学生为亚非拉同学的热切愿望所感动，把自己学习用的毛主席著作送给朋友们，他们便无比高兴地说：“我几年来最大的愿望实现了，这是你们送给我的最最珍贵的礼物！”有的人还把毛主席著作高举过顶，激动地喊着：“这是最宝贵的精神食粮，是战无不胜的武器，学习它，掌握它，比吃饭还重要。”
    有一次，一位非洲学生到中国学生的宿舍里来聊天，他看到了一本毛泽东军事文选，久久地翻阅，爱不释手，当我们的同学决定把这本书送给他的时候，他高兴得眉飞色舞，说：“谢谢啦，谢谢啦！让我们在学习毛泽东著作中共同取得巨大的成绩吧！”
    亚非拉革命学生对毛泽东思想的热爱，使得害怕真理、害怕革命的苏修领导集团十分惊慌。他们曾经采取种种卑鄙手段，妄图阻止毛泽东思想的传播。他们软硬兼施，威逼利诱，强迫亚非拉学生不同中国学生接近。他们以停发助学金和开除学籍相威胁，阻止亚非拉学生读毛主席著作。他们甚至无耻地派人到亚非拉学生的宿舍中去，把这些学生的毛主席著作偷走或公然搜走。但是，亚非拉革命学生们不畏强暴，他们严正地对苏联当局说：“你们可以把什么都搜走，唯独不许拿走毛主席著作。”“你们可以开除我！对我来说，重要的不是得到一张毕业文凭，而是掌握斗争的武器，这就是毛泽东思想！”
      带着自己的思想问题和本国革命斗争中的问题，活学活用毛主席著作
    在苏联学习的外国留学生，还自愿组织了很多毛泽东著作学习小组，经常召开学习讨论会。他们在学习中认真阅读毛主席著作，划重点，记笔记，写心得，结合自己的思想实际和本国的斗争实际活学活用。他们说：“我们一定要把毛泽东思想学到手，走毛泽东给我们指出的道路！”
    一位来自非洲的学生，带着自己思想中和本国革命斗争中存在的问题，活学活用毛主席著作，写下了三百多页的读书笔记和心得。另一位亚洲学生，应用毛主席关于阶级、矛盾和阶级斗争的观点，分析他自己国家的阶级斗争形势，写下了一篇几万字的文章。他们深有体会地指出：用毛泽东同志关于阶级斗争的理论和矛盾论的观点来观察问题，就能够看清楚什么是马列主义，什么是修正主义。
    一位来自拉丁美洲的学生说：“毛泽东同志关于武装斗争和游击战的理论，是非常卓越的革命理论。我国的游击队员都十分爱读毛泽东同志的军事著作，并且从中得到了巨大的力量。”另一位同学也说：“我国的历史证明，不把人民武装起来，要夺取政权是不可能的。毛泽东同志关于‘枪杆子里面出政权’的论断，是非常英明正确的。”
    有一位印度学生，非常恳切地希望中国学生能够给他找到一部《毛泽东选集》，他说：“我已经读过十几篇毛泽东同志的军事著作。他讲得非常对，分析得完全正确。我非常非常需要读毛泽东同志的其他著作，无论如何，你们一定给我找到一部《毛泽东选集》吧！”
    经过认真的学习，许多亚非拉革命学生，已经能够运用毛泽东思想来指导自己的斗争和生活。在苏修领导集团血腥镇压莫斯科亚非拉各国留学生援越反美游行的事件中，亚非拉革命学生和中国学生一起血洒莫斯科街头，受到苏修领导集团的残酷迫害。许多亚非拉学生在斗争中引用毛主席的话说：“‘捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。’苏联修正主义领导集团如此猖狂地镇压各国学生的革命行动，为美帝国主义效劳，它们也决不会违背这个逻辑的。”在斗争中，苏修领导集团强迫一位非洲学生参加反华活动，他坚定地拒绝参加。苏修领导集团便指使流氓殴打他，打得他遍体伤痕斑斑，还制造借口要开除他的学籍。这位非洲学生愤慨地说：“他们愈是这样疯狂地迫害我，愈使我认识到他们的反动本质。毛主席说过，‘被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事’，他们愈反对我，愈说明我做对了！”
      不管苏修集团怎样疯狂反华，都无法把伟大的毛泽东思想从革命人民心上赶走
    许多亚非拉革命学生还在日常生活中严格要求自己，决心按照毛主席的教导来磨炼自己的革命意志。他们衣服脏了自己洗，破了就找中国同学借针线，学习缝补衣服。他们说：“毛泽东同志教育中国学生要保持艰苦奋斗的生活作风，我们要向中国同学学习，将来回去还要把这种精神带给我们的伙伴。”在放暑假的时候，苏联当局安排一些外国留学生到苏联南方休假。但是，有些亚非拉革命学生主动提出来要去工厂和农村参加体力劳动，接近工农群众，而不愿去南方休假。他们说：“到那里去整天就是吃饭、睡觉、晒太阳，时间长了就会把革命意志消磨掉了！”
    这样的动人事例是无法一一列举的。现在已经回国的我国留苏学生，每当他们回忆起这些动人的事例时，他们都受到了一次再教育，深深地怀念着自己在苏联学习期间结识的亚非拉伙伴们。他们说，当他们离开苏联时，许多亚非拉革命学生曾经对中国同学说过的同样的一段话，是他们永远也忘记不了的。那时候，许多亚非拉伙伴们曾经紧握着他们的手说：“不管苏联修正主义领导集团怎样疯狂地反华，但是他们是无法把伟大的毛泽东思想从革命人民的心上赶走的！”
