The editorial board of the *Liberation Army Daily* writes: Chairman Mao's brilliant work, *Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War*, was published thirty years ago. Over the past thirty years, this great work has been like a beacon, illuminating the path of China's revolutionary war and also illuminating the path of revolutionary wars for the peoples of the world.

This great work comprehensively summarizes the rich experience of China's revolutionary war, formulating a complete set of theories and policies for studying and directing revolutionary wars. It is the first and most comprehensive, complete, systematic, and highest-level Marxist-Leninist military science document of the proletariat.

This great work reflects the objective laws of all revolutionary wars. Chairman Mao's great strategic thought is a universal truth applicable to all times and places. It is a guide for the revolutionary wars of the peoples of all countries, and a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. Chairman Mao's great strategic thought has guided China's revolutionary war to achieve great victories in the past, and now and in the future, it will always be the sole correct guiding principle for us to conduct anti-aggression wars.

This brilliant work is not only a great Marxist military work but also a great Marxist political and philosophical work. The many fundamental principles it discusses are applicable not only to the military field but also to all other fields.

Currently, U.S. imperialism, with the help of the Soviet revisionist leadership, is frantically expanding its aggression in Vietnam and attempting to impose war on our people. We must remain highly vigilant and strengthen our war preparedness. War preparedness involves countless details, but the most fundamental aspect is the preparation of Mao Zedong Thought. We must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. We must firmly implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, deeply study and apply Chairman Mao's great strategic thought, further strengthen the revolutionary and modern construction of our army, and be ready to deliver a crushing blow to the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices if they dare to invade!

To help cadres and soldiers study this great work, we have compiled this guide material for reference.

Historical Background

Chairman Mao's brilliant work, *Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War*, was published in December 1936. It is a scientific summary of the rich experience of China's second civil revolutionary war and the result of Chairman Mao's correct line defeating the erroneous lines of "left" and right opportunism.

From 1924 to 1927, during the first civil revolutionary war, the betrayal of the great landlords and bourgeoisie represented by Chiang Kai-shek and the surrender of leadership by the right opportunists within the party represented by Chen Duxiu resulted in failure. White terror spread across the country. Just as the Chinese revolution was at a critical juncture, Chairman Mao raised the banner of people's war, organized the famous Autumn Harvest Uprising, marched to Jinggangshan, established the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and the first revolutionary base area, ignited the blazing fire of the Chinese revolutionary war, and illuminated the path of the revolution.

However, at that time, the "left" opportunist line within the party, especially the third "left" opportunist line represented by Wang Ming, opposed and denied Chairman Mao's correct line, excluded Chairman Mao's leadership of the Red Army, and as a result, the Red Army was forced to withdraw from the revolutionary base areas, causing extremely serious losses to the Chinese revolution.

In January 1935, during the Long March, the Central Committee of the party held an enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau in Zunyi, ending the leadership of the "left" opportunist line, establishing Chairman Mao's leadership over the entire party, and saving the party and the Chinese revolution. From then on, the Chinese revolution has been continuously advancing from one victory to another under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao.

To eliminate the pernicious influence of the erroneous lines of "left" and right opportunism, to raise the Marxist level and proletarian military thought of the entire party, and to successfully lead the imminent anti-Japanese war, Chairman Mao, following *On the Tactics Against Japanese Imperialism*, wrote *Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War*, providing a comprehensive summary of the two-line struggle during the second civil revolutionary war.

Great Significance

*Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War* best summarizes the rich experience of the Chinese revolutionary war and creates a new proletarian military science. In this work, Chairman Mao brilliantly and creatively applies dialectical and historical materialism to profoundly discuss the fundamental views of the proletariat on war and the scientific methods of studying war, thoroughly analyzes the characteristics of the Chinese revolutionary war, reveals the objective laws of war, and formulates a complete set of invincible strategic and tactical principles for conducting people's wars.

This great work is the most comprehensive, complete, systematic, and highest-level Marxist military science masterpiece, the first proletarian military strategy, and the military program of the proletarian revolution.

This brilliant work is not only a great Marxist military classic but also a great Marxist political and philosophical classic. It is applicable not only to the military field but also to all other fields. It is a powerful ideological weapon for defeating imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries.

The principles and theories expounded by Chairman Mao in this work are universal truths derived from practice and verified in practice. The fundamental laws of the Chinese revolutionary war revealed in it are also the universal laws of all revolutionary wars. It is not only the guiding principle for the great victories of the past Chinese revolutionary wars but also the guiding principle for our future anti-aggression wars. It has made an immeasurable contribution to the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed nations and peoples in the world.

We are now in a new great era of world revolution. The people's revolutions and revolutionary wars in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging and developing vigorously. The proletariat and working people in Europe, North America, and Oceania are awakening anew. China's unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution is pushing socialist revolution to a deeper and broader new stage. However, U.S. imperialism and its accomplices are frantically escalating the war in Vietnam and attempting to impose war on our people. In such a situation, deeply studying this great work and mastering Chairman Mao's great strategic thought is of great strategic and practical significance for guiding the current proletarian cultural revolution, for smashing the sudden attacks of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, liberating Taiwan, defending the motherland, and for supporting the struggles of the revolutionary peoples of the world.

Key Points to Understand

In studying this great work, we should focus on the following points:

1. **Pick Up the Gun, Use Revolutionary War to Defeat Counter-Revolutionary War**

Chairman Mao said: "War—since the existence of private property and classes, has been the highest form of struggle used to resolve contradictions between classes and classes, nations and nations, states and states, political groups and political groups, at a certain stage of development." This is Chairman Mao's most scientific and complete definition of war.

In a class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable. The brutal exploitation and plunder by the reactionary ruling class will inevitably provoke strong resistance from the oppressed peoples and nations. Reactionary rulers, to maintain their rule, always first use bayonets and cannons to deal with revolutionary peoples. In such a situation, the oppressed and exploited peoples and nations, to achieve their liberation, seize political power, and win revolutionary victories, must take up arms and use revolutionary armed forces to oppose counter-revolutionary armed forces, using revolutionary war to defeat counter-revolutionary war. Chairman Mao said: "The working class and the laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the power of the gun; in this sense, we can say that the whole world can only be transformed with the gun." History has proven that the oppressed and exploited peoples and nations have achieved liberation and seized power by taking up arms, waging revolutionary wars, and defeating counter-revolutionary wars. China's revolution, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, defeated the imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries supported by them through a long revolutionary war, thus seizing power and winning revolutionary victories.

U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the peoples of the world today and the head of all reactionaries. It, together with the reactionaries of various countries, is frantically plundering and oppressing the peoples, brutally suppressing the revolutionary movements of the peoples, and imposing war on the revolutionary peoples. The peoples of various countries can only take up arms, use revolutionary war to oppose counter-revolutionary war, to ultimately defeat U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries, and to win the rights of the peoples and revolutionary victories.

The peoples who seize political power must rely on the gun to defend it. The peoples who have already seized power must never forget class struggle, firmly hold the gun in their hands, and always remain highly vigilant to prevent and smash the subversion and aggression of domestic and foreign enemies. Currently, U.S. imperialism, in close collaboration with the Soviet revisionist leadership, has shifted the focus of its global strategy to Asia and directed its spearhead at our country. We should fully prepare for the possibility of U.S. imperialism launching an aggressive war and be ready to deal with the enemy's early, large-scale, nuclear, and various types of wars on multiple fronts. We must base all our work on the principle of "fighting." If U.S. imperialism and its accomplices dare to impose an aggressive war on our people, we will resolutely use revolutionary war to completely annihilate them.

The modern revisionists, with the Soviet Communist Party leadership at their center, advocate "peaceful coexistence," "peaceful transition," and "peaceful competition," claiming that in the conditions of the existence of imperialism, a world without weapons, without armies, and without war can be achieved. They label the revolutionary wars of the peoples of all countries as "adventurism" and describe the encouragement and support of the revolutionary wars of the peoples of all countries as "warmongering." This is a shameless betrayal of the revolutionary cause of the peoples of the world and a complete betrayal of Marxism-Leninism. They are accomplices of U.S. imperialism in aggression and plunder. To oppose imperialism, we must resolutely oppose modern revisionism and thoroughly expose their criminal activities of colluding with imperialism and betraying the revolutionary peoples.

Chairman Mao emphasized that all revolutionary wars are just wars. The just wars of humanity are the banner of saving humanity, the highest honorable cause, and the bridge to turn world history into a new era. Every revolutionary must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely support and actively participate in all just wars, and contribute to the complete liberation of the peoples of the world, to the elimination of the root causes of war, and to the establishment of a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without exploitation.

2. **Rely on the Masses, Conduct People's War**

Chairman Mao said: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." (*On the Coalition Government*) The human factor, the political factor, is always the most fundamental factor in the victory of war. Chairman Mao also said: "Revolutionary war is the people's war," "The people's condition is the most important condition for the Red Army." As long as we closely rely on the people and unite with them, our army will be invincible.

During the second civil revolutionary war, the Kuomintang reactionaries, relying on their numerical and technical superiority in the army, continuously launched "encirclement and suppression" campaigns against the Red Army. However, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's people's war thought, the Red Army fully mobilized the masses of the base areas. Wherever the Red Army went, the people supported them, actively cooperating with the Red Army in combat, forming a net that trapped the enemy. The enemy was beaten everywhere and could not move an inch, "the fat were dragged thin, and the thin were dragged to death"; while the Red Army grew stronger with each battle, achieving glorious victories in four consecutive anti-"encirclement and suppression" campaigns.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the third civil revolutionary war, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's people's war thought, our army, relying on the masses of the people, together with the broad masses, defeated Japanese imperialism, overthrew the Kuomintang reactionary regime supported by U.S. imperialism, established a new China, and created a great revolutionary base in the world.

The revolutionary practice of the peoples of the world, especially the revolutionary practice of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, also fully proves that relying on the masses of the people and conducting people's war is the only correct path for the oppressed nations and peoples to overthrow the rule of imperialism and reactionaries and achieve complete liberation. The people of South Vietnam, relying on people's war, have beaten the U.S. imperialists, who are armed to the teeth, to a pulp, which is a very convincing example.

No matter how modern weapons and technical equipment develop, no matter how complex modern war becomes, people's war will always be our most effective weapon against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. Now we have produced our own missiles and nuclear weapons, which is a heavy blow to the U.S.-Soviet collusion in nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail, and a great encouragement to the revolutionary peoples of the world who are fighting bravely. However, in the future, we will still rely on people's war to defeat the enemy. Chairman Mao has long said: "The atomic bomb is a weapon of mass slaughter, but the decisive factor in war is the people, not one or two new weapons." (*Talk with the American Reporter Anna Louise Strong*) Any thought of relying solely on weapons for victory is extremely wrong and harmful.

To mobilize the broad masses of the people to actively participate in and support revolutionary war, extensive and in-depth political mobilization must be carried out, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm people's minds, to the greatest extent possible, to raise people's political and ideological awareness, and to mobilize people's revolutionary enthusiasm. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are fearless of hardship and fearless of death, able to overcome all difficulties and defeat all enemies.

To rely on the masses of the people and conduct people's war, universal armament and universal military service must be implemented. Under the absolute leadership of the party, on the one hand, there must be a strong people's army as the core force for conducting war; on the other hand, extensive people's armed organizations must be established, organizing and arming all who can be organized and armed, directly and indirectly participating in the war. Implementing a people's war that combines main force troops and local troops, regular troops and guerrilla forces, militia, and unarmed masses. The idea of abandoning people's guerrilla war, emphasizing only the role of the main force, and neglecting the role of local troops, militia, and guerrilla forces, as well as any idea of relying solely on the main force to fight, is completely wrong. The combination of main force, local force, and militia is our traditional military structure. In future anti-aggression wars, we will still rely on the masses of the people, on the militia and guerrilla forces. The billion people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are an immense force, a reliable support for our victory over the enemy, and an unbreakable iron wall.

The Red Guards born in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are a new generation nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, they dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, dare to pioneer, and dare to revolutionize, establishing immortal merits for the revolution. They are the vanguard of the cultural revolution and a strong reserve force for the People's Liberation Army. Once war breaks out, they will march to the battlefield and establish new merits in the anti-aggression war.

The modern revisionists, with the Soviet Communist Party leadership at their center, claim that in modern war, rockets and nuclear weapons can decide everything; in the conditions of nuclear weapons, the militia is just a pile of meat, etc. This is a thorough bourgeois weaponry theory and a complete exposure of their counter-revolutionary revisionist traitor faces.

3. **Implement Flexible and Mobile Strategy and Tactics, Concentrate Forces to Fight Annihilation Battles**

Chairman Mao summarized the strategy and tactics of people's war in four sentences: "You fight your way, I fight mine; if you can win, fight; if you can't win, retreat." This means to fully utilize our political advantages, the power of the masses, to use our strengths to strike at the enemy's weaknesses. When you attack us, we make it difficult for you to hit us or touch us; when we attack you, we hit you accurately and eat you up. In strategy, "one against ten"; in tactics, "ten against one," concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles.

Annihilation battles are the basic principle of our army's operations. Chairman Mao said: "Only by annihilating the enemy's effective strength can we break the 'encirclement and suppression' and develop the revolutionary base areas." "Against people, injuring ten fingers is not as good as cutting one finger; against the enemy, defeating ten divisions is not as good as annihilating one division." Only by fighting annihilation battles can we most effectively strike the enemy and achieve victory. During the second civil revolutionary war, the powerful enemy launched "encirclement and suppression" campaigns against the weak Red Army, with their forces always several times to more than ten times that of the Red Army. Under Chairman Mao's personal command, the Red Army used the method of concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles, annihilating large numbers of the enemy, repeatedly smashing the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" campaigns. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the basic principle of our army's operations was guerrilla warfare, but we did not neglect mobile warfare under favorable conditions. After eight years of hard fighting, we annihilated the enemy, grew stronger, and achieved great victories. During the third civil revolutionary war, our army concentrated absolutely superior forces in every battle, annihilating the enemy one by one. The scale of the battles grew larger and larger, the number of annihilated enemies grew more and more, our army grew stronger and stronger, and in the world-shocking Liaoning-Shenyang, Huaihai, and Pingjin campaigns, we annihilated 1.54 million enemies, and in three years, we annihilated more than 8 million Kuomintang bandits.

To fight annihilation battles, the first and foremost thing is to concentrate superior forces. Only by concentrating forces can we change the situation between the enemy and us, turning the disadvantage into an advantage, turning passivity into activity, turning the weak into the strong, turning defense into offense, and achieving the goal of annihilating the enemy. Concentrating forces is the material foundation for fighting annihilation battles. Therefore, in every battle, we must concentrate absolutely superior forces, that is, concentrate forces two, three, four times, or even five, six times that of the enemy, surround the enemy on all sides, strive for complete annihilation, and do not let any escape.

To concentrate forces to fight annihilation battles, we must adopt the tactic of luring the enemy deep into our territory, not fearing temporarily losing some pots and pans, voluntarily and plannedly abandoning some cities and places, and luring the enemy in to fight. Only by luring the enemy in can we force the enemy to disperse their forces, force the enemy to carry their baggage, force the enemy to make mistakes. This will give us time to concentrate superior forces, bite the enemy one by one, and finally preserve or seize cities and places. The idea of fearing temporarily losing some places, fearing some pots and pans being broken, and thus dividing forces to guard every inch of ground is completely wrong and cannot annihilate the enemy or defend cities and places.

The principle of concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles seems easy but is difficult to implement. Some people may agree with this method in peacetime, but when the battle comes, due to underestimating the enemy or being frightened by the enemy, they lose their initiative and often divide their forces, creating a passive situation and failing to annihilate the enemy. Therefore, commanders at all levels, no matter how complex, serious, or cruel the situation is, must always maintain a clear mind, independently and autonomously organize and use their forces, and concentrate forces to fight annihilation battles.

Concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles is not only the guiding thought for combat but also the guiding thought for all our work. No matter what work we do, we must adopt this method. We cannot try to do all the work at once but must complete it one by one. Food can only be eaten one bite at a time, factories can only be built one by one, and work can only be completed one by one. If we do not prioritize, grabbing this and that, dispersing our forces, we will not be able to do anything well. In a certain period, we must concentrate our forces to focus on solving one or two major problems, grasp them thoroughly, concentrate forces to fight annihilation battles, and complete the work well.

4. **Learn War from War, Master the Laws of War, and Actively Guide War**

Chairman Mao said: "The laws of war—this is a problem that anyone guiding war cannot fail to study and solve." Those who seriously study and master the laws of war and act according to these laws can correctly guide the war and win; otherwise, they will definitely fail and lose the war.

Chairman Mao, based on China's social nature and political, military, and economic conditions, comprehensively and deeply analyzed the main characteristics of the Chinese revolutionary war, brilliantly revealed the fundamental laws of the Chinese revolutionary war, creatively solved a series of fundamental problems in war guidance, and led the Chinese revolutionary war to achieve one great victory after another.

Chairman Mao created a completely new method of studying and learning the laws of war, emphasizing learning war from war. This is our main method. Doing revolution, doing war, is often not learning first and then doing, but doing and then learning. We only need to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, be bold and daring, and bravely engage in the actual war, temper ourselves in the stormy waves, and learn swimming in the water, we can recognize and master the laws of war.

The laws of war are the objective laws of the development of contradictions between the enemy and us. To recognize and master them, we must conduct thorough investigations and research on all aspects of the war situation. We must be familiar with the situation of our own troops, the situation of the enemy troops, and all other situations related to the war. From this, we find the laws of their actions and apply these laws to our own actions, achieving the goal of knowing the enemy and ourselves, and being invincible in a hundred battles.

The victory or defeat of a war is not only determined by the military, political, economic, and natural conditions of the two sides but also by the subjective guidance ability of the two sides. We must actively guide the war, and the most fundamental thing is to take Chairman Mao's strategic thought as the guide, take Chairman Mao's great practice as an example, and be good at learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the practice of war, closely combining theory with practice. On the basis of certain objective material conditions, fully exerting subjective initiative. In this way, we can become brave and wise heroes, staging a vivid and magnificent drama.

Doing war requires mastering the laws, and doing other revolutionary work also requires mastering the laws. Currently, we are conducting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and must take Mao Zedong Thought as the compass, take the "Sixteen Points" as a weapon, bravely engage in the revolutionary struggle, in the class struggle, learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, repeatedly learn, repeatedly practice, repeatedly summarize, and repeatedly improve, recognizing and mastering the laws of the development of class struggle, to achieve the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

5. **Firmly Implement Chairman Mao's Correct Line, the Fundamental Guarantee for Winning Revolutionary War**

Chairman Mao said: "Past revolutionary wars have proven that we not only need a correct Marxist political line but also a correct Marxist military line." The party's absolute leadership of war is the fundamental guarantee for the revolutionary war to be carried through to the end and achieve victory. The party's leadership of war is fundamentally to implement the correct line leadership. The Chinese revolution and revolutionary war have achieved brilliant victories under the guidance of the correct political and military lines formulated by Chairman Mao.

The correct political and military lines are not naturally and peacefully produced and developed but are produced and developed in the struggle against the "left" and right opportunist lines. As early as the first civil revolutionary war, the correct line represented by Chairman Mao fought resolutely against the right opportunist line represented by Chen Duxiu; during the second civil revolutionary war, the correct line successively overcame the three "left" opportunist lines and the right opportunist line represented by Zhang Guotao; during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the correct line defeated the right opportunist line represented by Wang Ming. Since the founding of the nation, the correct line represented by Chairman Mao has also fought several major battles against the representatives of the bourgeois line who have infiltrated the party and the army. The struggle between the correct line represented by Chairman Mao and various erroneous lines has never stopped. This was the case during the entire democratic revolutionary period, and it is also the case during the socialist revolutionary and construction period.

Chairman Mao said: "Without struggling against these harmful tendencies that harm the revolution and revolutionary war, and thoroughly overcoming them, the construction of the correct line and the victory of the revolutionary war are impossible." We must never forget Chairman Mao's teachings and resolutely struggle against various erroneous lines. Without defeating the erroneous lines, we cannot implement Chairman Mao's correct line and achieve victory in the revolution and revolutionary war.

Currently, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is to thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology and thoroughly establish Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the seven hundred million people. This is the greatest war preparedness for smashing the possible aggression of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices against our country. We must firmly implement and execute the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Comrade Lin Biao said: "The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is incompatible with the bourgeois reactionary line. Only by thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line and eliminating the influence of this line can we correctly, completely, and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's line."

We must follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher, and resolutely defend and implement Chairman Mao's correct line, turning our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, making our army a highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready revolutionary army.

    学习《中国革命战争的战略问题》
    《解放军报》编者按：毛主席的光辉巨著《中国革命战争的战略问题》，发表已经三十周年了。三十年来，这部伟大著作，像一盏明灯，照亮了中国人民革命战争的道路，也正在照亮世界人民革命战争的道路。
    这部伟大著作，高度地概括了中国革命战争的丰富经验，制定了一整套研究革命战争和指导革命战争的理论和政策，是无产阶级第一部最全面、最完整、最系统、最高水平的马克思列宁主义的军事科学文献。
    这部伟大著作，反映了一切革命战争的客观规律。毛主席的伟大战略思想，是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，是世界各国人民进行革命战争的指南，是反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的最强大的思想武器。毛主席的伟大战略思想，过去指导中国革命战争取得了伟大的胜利，现在和将来，永远都是指导我们进行反侵略战争的唯一正确的指导方针。
    这部光辉著作，不但是一部伟大的马克思主义的军事著作，也是一部伟大的马克思主义的政治著作和哲学著作。它所论述的许多基本原理，既适用于军事领域，也适用于其他一切领域。
    目前，美帝国主义在苏共修正主义领导集团的帮助下，正在疯狂地扩大侵略越南的战争，并企图把战争强加在我国人民头上。我们必须保持高度警惕，加强战备。战备工作千头万绪，最根本的是毛泽东思想的准备。我们一定要坚决响应林彪同志的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新的阶段。我们要坚决贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，要深入地学习和运用毛主席的伟大战略思想，进一步加强我军的革命化、现代化建设，随时准备给敢于进犯的美帝国主义及其帮凶以歼灭性的打击！
    为了帮助干部战士学习这部伟大著作，我们编写了这个辅导材料，供大家参考。
    历史背景
    毛主席的光辉巨著《中国革命战争的战略问题》，发表于一九三六年十二月，到现在三十周年了。它是我国第二次国内革命战争丰富经验的科学总结，是毛主席的正确路线战胜“左”、右倾机会主义错误路线的成果。
    一九二四年到一九二七年的第一次国内革命战争，由于以蒋介石为代表的大地主、大资产阶级的叛变，由于党内以陈独秀为代表的右倾机会主义者放弃领导，结果遭到了失败。白色恐怖笼罩着全国。正当中国革命处于危急关头，毛主席高举人民战争的大旗，组织著名的秋收起义，向井冈山进军，创建了中国工农红军和第一块红色革命根据地，点燃了中国革命战争的燎原烈火，照亮了革命的前程。
    但是，当时党内的“左”倾机会主义路线，特别是以王明为代表的第三次“左”倾机会主义路线，却反对和否定了毛主席的正确路线，排斥了毛主席对红军的领导，结果使红军被迫退出革命根据地，给中国革命造成了极为严重的损失。
    一九三五年一月，在长征途中，党中央在遵义召开的政治局扩大会议，结束了“左”倾机会主义的领导，确立了毛主席在全党的领导地位，挽救了党，挽救了中国革命。从此，中国革命就一直在我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。
    为了肃清“左”、右倾机会主义错误路线的恶劣影响，为了提高全党的马克思主义水平和无产阶级军事思想，为了胜利地领导即将到来的抗日战争，毛主席继《论反对日本帝国主义的策略》之后，又写出《中国革命战争的战略问题》这一伟大著作，对第二次国内革命战争两条路线斗争作了全面的总结。
    伟大意义
      《中国革命战争的战略问题》，最好地概括了中国革命战争的丰富经验，创造了崭新的无产阶级军事科学。在这部著作里，毛主席天才地、创造性地运用辩证唯物论和历史唯物论，精辟地论述了无产阶级对待战争的根本观点和研究战争的科学方法，透彻地分析了中国革命战争的特点，揭示了战争的客观规律，制定了进行人民战争的一整套战无不胜的战略战术原则。
    这部伟大著作，是一部最全面、最完整、最系统、最高水平的马克思主义的军事科学巨著，是第一部无产阶级军事战略学，是无产阶级革命的军事纲领。
    这部光辉著作，不仅是一部伟大的马克思主义的军事经典著作，而且也是一部伟大的马克思主义的政治的和哲学的经典著作；不仅适用于军事领域，而且适用于其它一切领域。它是战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的强大的思想武器。
    毛主席在这部著作中所阐明的原则原理，是来自实践，又在实践中检验过的普遍真理。它所揭示的中国革命战争的根本规律，也是一切革命战争的普遍规律。它不仅是过去中国革命战争取得伟大胜利的指导方针，而且也是我们未来反侵略战争的指导方针。它对全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的革命斗争，作出了不可估量的贡献。
    我们正处在世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲地区的人民革命和革命战争，风起云涌，蓬勃发展。欧洲、北美洲和大洋洲的无产阶级和劳动人民，正处在新的觉醒之中。我国开展的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，将社会主义革命推进到一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段。但是，美帝国主义及其帮凶正在越南疯狂地进行战争“升级”，企图把战争强加到我国人民头上。在这样的情况下深入学习这部伟大著作，掌握毛主席的伟大战略思想，对于指导当前的无产阶级文化大革命，对于粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶的突然袭击，解放台湾，保卫祖国，对于支援世界革命人民的斗争，具有重大的战略意义和现实意义。
    要着重领会的问题
    当前我们学习这部伟大著作，要着重领会以下几个问题。
    一、拿起枪杆子，用革命战争消灭反革命战争
    毛主席说：“战争——从有私有财产和有阶级以来就开始了的、用以解决阶级和阶级、民族和民族、国家和国家、政治集团和政治集团之间、在一定发展阶段上的矛盾的一种最高的斗争形式。”这是毛主席给战争下的最科学、最完整的定义。
    在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的。反动统治阶级的残酷压榨和掠夺，必然引起被压迫人民和被压迫民族的强烈反抗。反动统治者为了维护自己的统治，总是首先用刺刀和大炮来对付革命的人民。在这种情况下，被压迫、被剥削的人民和民族，要求得到自己的解放，夺取政权，取得革命的胜利，只有针锋相对地拿起武器，用革命的武装来反对反革命的武装，用革命战争来消灭反革命战争。毛主席说：“工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主；在这个意义上，我们可以说，整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”历史事实证明，被压迫、被剥削的人民和民族，所以能够获得解放，取得政权，都是拿起武器、大搞革命战争，用革命战争消灭了反革命战争的结果。我国革命就是在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，经过长期的革命战争，打败了帝国主义及其支持下的国民党反动派，才取得了政权，赢得了革命的胜利。
    美帝国主义是当代世界人民最凶恶的敌人，是一切反动派的总头子。它伙同各国反动派疯狂地掠夺和压迫人民，残酷地镇压人民的革命运动，把战争强加在革命人民的头上。各国人民也只有拿起枪杆子，用革命战争反对反革命战争，才能最终打倒美帝国主义和一切反动派，才能赢得人民的权利和革命的胜利。
    革命人民夺取政权必须依靠枪杆子，保卫政权也必须依靠枪杆子。已经夺取了政权的人民，只有念念不忘阶级斗争，紧握手中枪，时刻保持高度警惕，才能防止和粉碎国内外敌人的颠覆和侵略。目前美帝国主义在苏联修正主义领导集团的密切配合下，已把它的全球战略的重点转移到亚洲，并把矛头指向我国。我们应该充分做好反对美帝国主义发动侵略战争的准备工作，随时准备对付敌人早打、大打、打核战争、打各种战争、在几条战线上打。要把全部工作的立脚点放在“打”字上。如果美帝国主义及其帮凶胆敢把侵略战争强加在我国人民头上，我们就坚决用革命战争彻底把它们消灭。
    以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者，他们大肆宣扬“和平共处”、“和平过渡”、“和平竞赛”，说什么在帝国主义存在的条件下，可以实现“没有武器、没有军队、没有战争的世界”，他们把世界各国人民的革命战争，说成是“冒险主义”，把鼓舞和支持世界各国人民的革命战争，说成是“好战”。这是对世界各国人民的革命事业的无耻出卖，是对马克思列宁主义的彻底背叛。他们是美帝国主义进行侵略和掠夺的帮凶。我们要反对帝国主义，就必须坚决反对现代修正主义，彻底揭露他们勾结帝国主义、出卖革命人民的罪恶活动。
    毛主席强调指出，一切革命战争都是正义战争，人类正义战争是拯救人类的旗帜，是至高无上的荣誉的事业，是把全世界历史转到新时代的桥梁。我们每个革命者，都应当切实遵循毛主席的教导，坚决支持和积极参加一切正义战争，为全世界人民的彻底解放，为消灭战争的根源，为建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界作出贡献。
      二、依靠人民群众，实行人民战争
    毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”（《论联合政府》）人的因素，政治的因素，永远是战争致胜因素中最根本的因素。毛主席还说：“革命战争是民众的事”，“人民这个条件，对于红军是最重要的条件。”只要我们紧紧地依靠人民，和人民打成一片，我们这个军队就能无敌于天下。
    第二次国内革命战争时期，蒋介石反动派，依仗他在军队数量和技术装备上的优势，不断地向红军进行“围剿”。但是，红军在毛主席人民战争思想的指导下，充分发动了根据地的人民群众。红军打到哪里，人民就支援到哪里，积极配合红军作战，形成了一个天罗地网。使敌人处处挨打，寸步难行，“肥的拖瘦，瘦的拖死”；而红军却越打越强，连续取得四次反“围剿”的辉煌胜利。
    抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争，在毛主席人民战争思想的指导下，我军依靠人民群众，和广大人民一起，战胜了日本帝国主义，推翻了美帝国主义支持下的蒋介石反动王朝，建立了一个新中国，创造了一个伟大的世界革命的根据地。
    世界人民的革命实践，特别是亚、非、拉地区各国人民的革命实践，也充分证明，依靠人民群众，实行人民战争，是被压迫民族、被压迫人民推翻帝国主义和反动派的统治，彻底解放自己的唯一正确的道路。南越人民依靠人民战争，把武装到牙齿的美帝国主义打得落花流水，就是一个最有说服力的例子。
    不管现代武器和技术装备怎样发展，不管现代战争怎样复杂，人民战争始终是我们对付美帝国主义及其走狗的最有效的法宝。现在我们已经制造出自己的导弹核武器，这对美苏勾结实行核垄断、核讹诈，是一个沉重的打击，对于全世界正在进行英勇斗争的革命人民是一个巨大的鼓舞。但是，今后我们仍然要依靠人民战争去打败敌人。毛主席早就说过：“原子弹是一种大规模屠杀的武器，但是决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是一两件新式武器。”（《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》）任何单纯依靠武器制胜的思想，都是非常错误的，非常有害的。
    要使广大人民群众积极参加和支持革命战争，必须进行广泛的深入的政治动员，用毛泽东思想武装人的头脑，最大限度地提高人的政治思想觉悟，调动人的革命积极性。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民，一不怕苦，二不怕死，能够克服各种困难，战胜一切敌人。
    依靠人民群众，实行人民战争，必须全民武装，全民皆兵。在党的绝对领导下，一方面要有一支坚强的人民军队，作为进行战争的骨干力量；另一方面，要广泛地建立人民群众的武装组织，把一切可以组织起来、武装起来的人都组织起来、武装起来，直接、间接地参加战争。实行主力兵团和地方兵团相结合，正规军和游击队、民兵相结合，武装群众和非武装群众相结合的人民战争。那种主张放弃人民的游击战争，只重视主力军的作用，忽视地方军、民兵、游击队的作用的思想，以及任何单纯依靠主力军打仗的思想，都是完全错误的。主力军、地方军、民兵三结合，这是我们武装力量的传统体制。在未来反侵略战争中，仍然需要依靠人民群众，依靠民兵、游击队。用毛泽东思想武装起来的亿万人民群众，是一个巨大无比的力量，是我们战胜敌人的靠山，是什么力量也打不破的真正的铜墙铁壁。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中诞生的红卫兵，是毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的一代新人。他们在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线指引下，敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢于革命，为革命立下了不朽的功勋。他们是文化大革命的急先锋，是人民解放军强大的后备力量。一旦战争爆发，他们就将走上战场，在反侵略战争中，建立新的功勋。
    以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者，胡说什么在现代战争中，火箭核武器可以决定一切；在核武器条件下，民兵只是一堆肉，等等。完全是地地道道的资产阶级的唯武器论，是他们反革命修正主义叛徒嘴脸的大暴露。
      三、实行灵活机动的战略战术，集中兵力打歼灭战
    毛主席把人民战争的战略战术用四句话加以高度概括，叫做“你打你的，我打我的；打得赢就打，打不赢就走”。这就是要充分发挥我们政治上的优势，发挥人民群众的威力，以我之长，击敌之短。你打我时，叫你打不到，摸不着；我打你时，就要打准你，吃掉你。在战略上“以一当十”，在战术上“以十当一”，集中兵力打歼灭战。
    歼灭战是我军作战的基本方针。毛主席说：“只有歼灭敌人的有生力量才能打破‘围剿’和发展革命根据地。”“对于人，伤其十指不如断其一指；对于敌，击溃其十个师不如歼灭其一个师。”只有打歼灭战，才能最有效地打击敌人，取得胜利。第二次国内革命战争时期，强大的敌人向弱小的红军进行“围剿”，其兵力总是超过红军几倍到十几倍。红军在毛主席的亲自指挥下，运用集中兵力打歼灭战的方法，大量地歼灭了敌人，一次又一次地粉碎了敌人的“围剿”。抗日战争时期，我军的作战方针，基本的是游击战，但不放松有利条件下的运动战，经过八年苦战，消灭了敌人，壮大了自己，取得了伟大的胜利。第三次国内革命战争时期，我军每战集中绝对优势兵力，一个一个地歼灭敌人。战役规模越打越大，歼灭敌人越来越多，我军越打越强，在震惊世界的辽沈、淮海、平津三大战役中歼灭敌人一百五十四万，三年中歼灭了蒋介石匪军八百多万人。
    要打歼灭战，首先和主要的是集中优势兵力。只有集中兵力，才能改变敌我之间的形势，变劣势为优势，变被动为主动，变弱者为强者，变防御为进攻，达到歼灭敌人的目的。集中兵力是打歼灭战的物质基础。因此，每战必须集中绝对优势的兵力，即集中两倍、三倍、四倍，甚至是五倍、六倍于敌人的兵力，四面包围敌人，力求全歼，不使漏网。
    为了集中兵力打歼灭战，必须采取诱敌深入的方针，不怕暂时打烂些坛坛罐罐，主动地有计划地放弃一些城市和地方，把敌人放进来打。只有把敌人放进来，才能逼着敌人分散兵力，逼着敌人背起包袱，逼着敌人犯错误。才能便于我们争取时间，集中优势兵力，一口一口地吃掉敌人，最后地保住或夺取城市和地方。那种害怕暂时丢掉一些地方，害怕部分地打烂坛坛罐罐，因而分兵把口、处处抵御的想法，既不能消灭敌人，也不能守住城市和地方，是完全错误的。
    集中兵力打歼灭战的原则，看来容易，实行颇难。有些人平时也赞成这一战法，但到临战，由于轻视敌人或被敌人所吓倒，失去自主能力，每每分散兵力，造成被动局面，不能歼灭敌人。因此，各级指挥员无论处于怎样复杂、严重、残酷的环境，都应始终保持清醒的头脑，独立自主地组织和使用自己的力量，集中兵力打歼灭战。
    集中兵力打歼灭战，不仅是作战的指导思想，也是我们一切工作的指导思想。无论做什么工作，都必须采取这个方法。我们不能企图一下子把所有的工作都做好，而必须一个一个地去完成。饭只能一口一口地吃，工厂只能一座一座地建，工作也只能一件一件地完成。如果不分主次，这也抓，那也抓，把力量分得很散，就什么也搞不好。在一个时期内只有集中力量去着重解决一两个主要问题，一抓到底，集中兵力打歼灭战，才能把工作做好。
      四、从战争学习战争，掌握战争的规律，能动地指导战争
    毛主席说：“战争的规律——这是任何指导战争的人不能不研究和不能不解决的问题。”凡是认真研究和掌握了战争规律，按照规律办事的，就能正确地指导战争，就能打胜仗；反之，就一定要碰壁，一定要打败仗。
    毛主席根据中国的社会性质和政治、军事、经济等情况，全面地、深刻地分析了中国革命战争的主要特点，天才地揭示了中国革命战争的根本规律，创造性地解决了战争指导上的一系列根本问题，引导中国革命战争取得了一个接一个的伟大胜利。
    毛主席创造了全新的研究和学习战争规律的方法，强调从战争学习战争，这是我们的主要方法。干革命，干战争，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。我们只要遵循毛主席的教导，“敢”字当头，“干”字当头，勇敢地投入战争的实际，在大风大浪中锻炼，在游泳中学习游泳，就能够认识和掌握战争的规律。
    战争规律，是敌我双方矛盾发展的客观规律。要认识它和掌握它，就必须对战争情况的各方面，进行周密的调查研究。既要摸熟自己部队的情况，又要摸熟敌人部队的情况，还要摸熟一切和战争有关的其它情况。从中找出其行动的规律，并且应用这些规律于自己的行动，做到知彼知己，百战百胜。
    战争的胜负，固然取决于作战双方的军事、政治、经济、自然等条件，但是，还决定于作战双方主观指导的能力。我们要能动地指导战争，最根本的就是以毛主席的战略思想为指导，以毛主席的伟大实践为榜样，善于在战争的实践中活学活用毛主席著作，把理论和实际紧密结合起来。在一定的客观物质基础之上，充分发挥主观能动性。这样，就能够变为勇敢而明智的英雄，导演出有声有色、威武雄壮的活剧来。
    干战争要掌握规律，干其他革命工作也要掌握规律。当前我们正在进行无产阶级文化大革命，必须以毛泽东思想为指针，以“十六条”为武器，勇敢地投入到革命斗争的洪流中去，在阶级斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，反复学习，反复实践，不断总结，不断提高，认识和掌握阶级斗争的发展规律，才能取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    五、坚决贯彻毛主席的正确路线，是取得革命战争胜利的根本保证
    毛主席说：“过去的革命战争证明，我们不但需要一个马克思主义的正确的政治路线，而且需要一个马克思主义的正确的军事路线。”党对战争的绝对领导，是使革命战争坚持到底并取得胜利的根本保证。党领导战争最根本的就是实行正确的路线领导。中国革命和革命战争，就是在毛主席所制定的正确的政治路线和军事路线的指导下，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    正确的政治路线和军事路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是在同“左”、右倾机会主义路线的斗争中产生和发展起来的。远在第一次国内革命战争时期，以毛主席为代表的正确路线就同陈独秀的右倾机会主义路线进行了坚决的斗争；第二次国内革命战争时期，先后克服了三次“左”倾机会主义路线和张国焘右倾机会主义路线；抗日战争时期，又战胜了王明的右倾机会主义路线。建国以来，又同混进党内、军内的资产阶级路线代表人物，进行了几次大的斗争。毛主席代表的正确路线同形形色色的错误路线的斗争，一直没有停止过。在整个民主革命时期是这样，在社会主义革命和建设时期也是这样。
    毛主席说：“不同这些危害革命和革命战争的有害的倾向作斗争，并且彻底地克服它们，正确路线的建设和革命战争的胜利，是不可能的。”我们要时刻不忘毛主席的教导，坚决地同各种错误路线展开不调和的斗争。不打倒错误路线，就不能贯彻毛主席的正确路线，就不能取得革命和革命战争的胜利。
    当前我国正在进行的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，就是要大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想把七亿人民都武装起来。这对粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶可能发动对我国的侵略，是最大的战备。我们必须坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，坚定不移地把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。林彪同志说：“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，同资产阶级反动路线，是水火不相容的，只有彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，清除这条路线的影响，才能正确地、完全地、彻底地执行毛主席的路线。”
    我们一定要按照林彪同志的指示，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓死捍卫和坚决贯彻毛主席的正确路线，把我军办成毛泽东思想的大学校，使我军成为一支非常无产阶级化，非常战斗化的革命军队。
