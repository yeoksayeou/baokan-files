Cambodia's Foreign Ministry Condemns New U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam
Supports the Just Stance of the Vietnamese Government

	New China News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 18 — According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on December 18, the Royal Government of Cambodia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on December 16 condemning the crime of U.S. aircraft repeatedly bombing the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and expressing support for the just stance articulated in the December 14 statement by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	The statement said: "The Royal Government is extremely outraged to learn that the U.S. Air Force has increasingly intensified its bombing of certain areas and suburbs of the capital, Hanoi, causing heavy losses to the lives and property of the residents. The American imperialists, through intensified mad bombing, have taken a new and extremely dangerous step in escalating the war of aggression against the Vietnamese people."

	The statement said that the Royal Government supports the just stance articulated by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in its December 14, 1966 statement, and condemns the American imperialists for intensifying the war of aggression against Vietnam and for carrying out such evil bombings against the brotherly Vietnamese people.
