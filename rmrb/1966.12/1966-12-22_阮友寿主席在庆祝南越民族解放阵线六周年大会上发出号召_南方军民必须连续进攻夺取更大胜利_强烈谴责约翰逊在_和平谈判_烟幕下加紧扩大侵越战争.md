Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a call to action at the sixth anniversary celebration of the Front. He urged the military and civilians of the South to launch continuous offensives to achieve greater victories. He strongly condemned President Johnson for using the guise of "peace talks" to escalate the war in Vietnam.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, December 20th - According to the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam held a grand meeting in the liberated areas on the 17th to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

	Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Vice Chairman Pham Ngoc Thao, and other Central Committee members, as well as representatives from various political parties, organizations, liberation armed forces, and local people, totaling more than 2,000 people, attended the meeting.

	Nguyen Huu Tho delivered a speech at the meeting. He first reviewed the glorious journey and great victories achieved by the military and civilians of the South in the past six years of struggle. He analyzed the current predicament of U.S. imperialism and its puppets, who are deeply mired and passive. He emphasized that the more the U.S. aggressors escalate the war, the more they will find themselves in a dead end, becoming weaker and more passive.

	Nguyen Huu Tho pointed out that the U.S. and puppet forces have suffered extremely serious defeats, and their morale has plummeted rapidly, like a person falling into an abyss. The desertion of puppet soldiers is becoming increasingly widespread and intense. The anti-war movement among U.S. soldiers is also spreading in the so-called "elite" units. After the U.S. military enters cities controlled by the enemy, the political and economic situation there becomes even more chaotic. The struggle of the American people against their government's policy of aggression is becoming increasingly fierce. The warmongers like Johnson and McNamara are facing condemnation from around the world.

	Nguyen Huu Tho enthusiastically praised the brilliant achievements of the military and civilians of the South in the current dry season. He pointed out that obviously, the more U.S. troops are increased, the more intense the war becomes, the more severe their defeat will be.

	Nguyen Huu Tho said, "We, the 14 million people of the South, are greatly encouraged by the tremendous achievements of the 17 million compatriots in the North in their struggle and production. We express our deepest gratitude to the people of the North who are wholeheartedly supporting the liberation struggle in the South. With the unity of the 31 million people of the nation, adhering to the spirit of 'the South calls, the North responds; the North calls, the South responds,' we will surely defeat the U.S. aggressors."

	He strongly condemned Johnson for hypocritically advocating "peace talks" while vigorously escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam.

	Nguyen Huu Tho pointed out that at present, the U.S. aggressors are implementing a new war "escalation" against North Vietnam, attacking the heart of the nation, Hanoi, and are rapidly increasing the number of troops and weapons sent to South Vietnam. However, the U.S. aggressors have already suffered heavy defeats in local wars and are in a passive and desperate situation. The military and civilians of the South must launch continuous offensives, seize the initiative, and strive to achieve even greater victories.

	Nguyen Huu Tho finally called on all military and civilians of South Vietnam to actively respond to the call of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on October 27th, resolutely smash the new counteroffensive plans of the U.S.-puppet clique, and achieve even greater victories in the 1966-1967 dry season.

    阮友寿主席在庆祝南越民族解放阵线六周年大会上发出号召
    南方军民必须连续进攻夺取更大胜利
    强烈谴责约翰逊在“和平谈判”烟幕下加紧扩大侵越战争
    新华社河内二十日电　据越南南方解放电台广播：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会十七日在解放区举行大会，隆重庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立六周年。
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿、副主席冯文恭和其他中央委员，以及各政党、团体、解放武装力量和当地人民的代表共两千多人参加了大会。
    阮友寿在会上发表讲话。他首先概述了南方军民六年来在战斗中迅速成长壮大的光辉历程和取得的伟大胜利，分析了美帝国主义及其走狗目前深陷泥潭和被动挨打的困境。他强调指出，美国强盗越进行战争“升级”，就越走投无路，越衰弱和被动。
    阮友寿指出，美伪军遭到了极其严重的失败，士气像失足的人掉进深渊里一样迅速低落。伪军的逃伍事件正在日益广泛和猛烈地发展着。美国士兵的反战运动也开始在美国的各个所谓“善战师”中蔓延。当美军开进敌人控制的城市后，那里的政治和经济情况就变得更加混乱。美国人民反对美国政府的侵略政策的斗争日益激烈地进行着。约翰逊—麦克纳马拉等好战头目正在遭到全世界的谴责。
    阮友寿热烈表扬南方军民在进入目前的旱季时所取得的辉煌战绩。他指出，显然，美国增兵越多，战争越激烈，它的失败就越惨重。
    阮友寿说，我们一千四百万南方人民对一千七百万北方骨肉同胞在战斗和生产中取得的巨大成绩，感到欢欣鼓舞，并对全心全力支援南方解放斗争的北方人民表示无限的感激。我们全国三千一百万人民团结一致，本着南方呼唤，北方响应；北方呼唤，南方响应的精神，必定彻底战胜美国侵略强盗。
    他强烈谴责约翰逊一面叫嚷虚假的“和平谈判”，一面大力加强侵略越南战争的“升级”行动。
    阮友寿指出，目前，美国强盗正在对越南北方实行新的战争“升级”，袭击越南全国的心脏河内市，并且加紧向越南南方增派军队和增运武器。但是，美国强盗在局部战争中已经遭到了惨重的失败，陷入被动和狼狈不堪的困境。我国南方军民必须以连续的攻势，乘胜前进，决心夺取日益巨大的胜利。
    阮友寿最后号召全体越南南方军民积极响应越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会十月二十七日的号召，决心粉碎美伪集团的新的反攻计划，在一九六六——一九六七年旱季中夺取更加巨大的胜利。
