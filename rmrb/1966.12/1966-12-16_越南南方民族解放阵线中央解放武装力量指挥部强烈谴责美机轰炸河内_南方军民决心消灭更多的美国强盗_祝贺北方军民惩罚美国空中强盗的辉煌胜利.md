The Central Command of the Liberation Armed Forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam sent a telegram on December 14 to the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front and the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialist airplanes' continuous bombing of Hanoi City, and warmly congratulating the military and people of North Vietnam on their brilliant victory of shooting down more than 1,600 U.S. imperialist planes.

The telegram said, the U.S. imperialists' continuous bombing and strafing of the city of Hanoi is a very serious new "escalation" in their war of aggression against Vietnam. The people of South Vietnam are extremely indignant at the U.S. imperialists' heinous crimes.

The telegram said, the military and people of Hanoi have given the U.S. aggressors the punishment they deserve, making the whole nation rejoice. The victory of the military and people of the North in shooting down more than 1,600 U.S. planes has once again proven the complete failure of the U.S. "air superiority," and shown the resolve of the military and people of the North to resist the U.S. and save the country.

The telegram concluded, the military and people of South Vietnam are determined to continue fighting, to fight even harder, and to achieve greater victories this coming winter and spring, to annihilate more U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, and to avenge our compatriots who have been killed by them.

    祝贺北方军民惩罚美国空中强盗的辉煌胜利
    新华社河内十五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和越南南方解放武装力量指挥部，十四日打电报给越南祖国战线中央委员会和越南人民军总司令部，强烈谴责美国强盗飞机连续轰炸河内市的滔天罪行，并且热烈祝贺越南北方军民击落一千六百多架美国强盗飞机的辉煌胜利。
    电报说，美帝国主义接连轰炸和扫射河内市区，是它在侵越战争中的极其严重的新“升级”。越南南方人民对美帝国主义的滔天罪行感到无比愤慨。
    电报说，河内军民给了美国侵略者以应得的惩罚，使全国人民欢欣鼓舞。北方军民击落一千六百多架美国飞机的胜利，再一次证明了美国“空中优势”的彻底破产，显示了北方军民抗美救国的决心。
    电报最后说，越南南方军民决心连续战斗，打得更狠，在今冬明春立下更大的战功，消灭更多的美国侵略强盗及其走狗，为被它们杀害的同胞报仇。
