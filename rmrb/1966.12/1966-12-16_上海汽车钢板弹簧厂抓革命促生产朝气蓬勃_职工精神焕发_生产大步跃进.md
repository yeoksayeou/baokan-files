The renowned Daqing-style enterprise, Shanghai Automobile Leaf Spring Factory (formerly known as Weihai Iron Works), has seen its revolutionary workers seize the revolution and promote production during the Cultural Revolution. This has driven the entire factory to achieve a vibrant and lively new situation on both the revolutionary and production fronts. The factory's production and technical levels were already among the best in the country last year, and this year they have made significant strides forward based on that foundation.

Great Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive driving Shanghai Automobile Leaf Spring Factory forward on both the spiritual and material fronts. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary workers have developed an unprecedented level of awareness in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, particularly the "Three Constantly Read Articles." They use these articles as their guiding principles, breaking down selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, and actively fostering a bold spirit of daring to think, speak, act, innovate, and revolutionize in both class struggle and production struggle. They boldly expose those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and all ghosts and monsters, and boldly innovate in the realm of production technology. The entire factory presents a great situation.

In early August, the factory held a heated debate over the renovation of a tempering furnace. The furnace was originally designed by the factory's deputy director in charge of technical work, and it was quite irrational. During the high tide of the Cultural Revolution, the masses decided to "revolutionize" the furnace. However, there were two different opinions on how to reform it. The majority advocated for a major overhaul of the furnace, and the factory leadership also leaned towards this plan. But two workers firmly advocated for a minor overhaul. After three debates, both sides insisted on their views, and no decision was made. Later, the two workers who advocated for the minor overhaul invited everyone to the furnace site to discuss the reform plan. Only then did people realize that a minor overhaul would suffice. Finally, the minor overhaul plan was supplemented, and the reform was realized in a good and economical way. The masses dared to propose different opinions, dared to insist on their opinions, and dared to correct their opinions in practice. This is a new trend that has emerged in the factory during the Cultural Revolution.

Revolutionary workers, with the spirit of daring to revolutionize at the forefront, have also put forward a series of reform opinions and suggestions for the design of leaf springs, the technology, materials, equipment, and techniques used in producing leaf springs. The workers say: Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the realm of production struggle and scientific experimentation, humanity is constantly developing, and nature is constantly developing. It will never stop at a certain level." Some of the production technologies we are currently using are no longer suitable for the development of production, and we cannot let them restrict our hands and feet. They launched a mass scientific experimentation activity related to improving the quality of leaf springs. This year, they have experimented with more than 100 sets of leaf spring assemblies and more than 200 individual leaf springs, accumulating more than 8,000 data points. Based on this, they have redetermined the new design, new technology, new equipment, and new materials for producing leaf springs. They took the initiative to innovate equipment, further improving the factory's mechanization level and production efficiency. Now, some key processes have achieved semi-automated production. The leaf springs they produce have significantly improved in quality.

    上海汽车钢板弹簧厂抓革命促生产朝气蓬勃
    职工精神焕发  生产大步跃进
    据新华社上海十五日电　著名的大庆式企业上海汽车钢板弹簧厂（原名卫海铁工厂）的革命职工，在文化大革命中抓革命促生产，推动全厂在革命和生产两条战线上，都出现了朝气蓬勃、生动活泼的新局面。这个工厂的生产技术水平去年就进入了国内先进行列，今年又在原来的基础上向前大大跃进了一步。
    伟大的毛泽东思想，是上海汽车钢板弹簧厂在精神和物质两条战线上前进的火车头。在无产阶级文化大革命中，革命职工对毛主席，对毛泽东思想更加热爱，活学活用毛主席著作特别是活学活用“老三篇”的自觉性空前提高。他们以“老三篇”为座右铭，破“私”立“公”，在阶级斗争和生产斗争中，积极发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢革命的无产阶级革命精神。他们大胆揭发党内走资本主义道路的当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神，在生产技术领域内大胆创新。全厂呈现出一派大好形势。
    八月初，这个厂为了翻修一座回火炉，职工中曾经展开一场热烈的争论。这座炉子，原来是由工厂管技术工作的副厂长设计的，很不合理。文化大革命高潮中，群众决心要“革”这座炉子的“命”。但对怎样改革，当时有两种意见。多数人主张对炉子进行大改，厂领导也倾向于这个方案；但有两个工人，坚决主张小改。开了三次辩论会，双方都坚持自己的意见，决定不下来。后来，主张小改的两个工人，把大家请到炉子跟前，在现场谈改革方案，人们才认识到进行小改就可以了。最后，对这个小改方案又进行了补充，又好又省地实现了改革。群众这样敢于提出不同的意见，敢于坚持自己的意见，勇于在实践中修正自己的意见，是这个厂在文化大革命中出现的新风气。
    革命职工们以“敢”字当头的革命精神，对钢板弹簧的设计，对生产钢板弹簧用的工艺、材料、装备、技术，也提出了一系列的改革意见和建议。职工们说：毛主席教导我们：“在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。”我们现在采用的一些生产工艺，有很多已不适应生产的发展了，我们不能再让它们束缚自己的手脚。他们开展了有关提高钢板弹簧质量的群众性科学实验活动，在今年内，已试验了一百多副钢板弹簧总成，二百多个单片，积累了八千多个数据，并据此重新确定了生产钢板弹簧的新的设计、新的工艺、新的技术、新的装备和新的材料。他们自己动手革新设备，使全厂机械化程度和生产效率进一步提高。现在一些关键工序已经实现了半自动化生产。他们生产的钢板弹簧，质量大大跃进。
