The people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most creative. China builds a sulfuric acid plant from waste gas at an internationally advanced level.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, relevant metallurgical enterprise workers in China, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on liberating the mind and breaking superstitions, have displayed the bold, pioneering, and creative spirit of the proletarian revolution. They have engaged in a head-on struggle with bourgeois technical "authorities," building China's first waste gas sulfuric acid plant at an internationally advanced level. They have used the waste gas from smelting non-ferrous metals, which has a low concentration of sulfur dioxide and high dust content, to produce high-quality sulfuric acid. This is a triumphant song of smashing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie and boosting the morale of the working class. It is another brilliant victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

	Several years ago, China began planning to build a factory to produce sulfuric acid from waste gas. However, due to being constrained by foreign frameworks, progress was slow. Some bourgeois technical "authorities" and "experts," based on certain foreign books and formulas, had insisted that waste gas from smelting with low sulfur dioxide content, high mineral dust, and instability could not be used to produce sulfuric acid. For several years, there have been many debates around whether waste gas with low concentration and high dust content can be used to produce sulfuric acid. This seemingly technical debate was actually a struggle between two worldviews, two methodologies, and two paths of industrial development.

	In the second half of 1963, during the socialist education movement, the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of workers in relevant metallurgical enterprises soared. They were deeply pained by the fact that the country urgently needed sulfuric acid, yet a large amount of raw materials for producing sulfuric acid were being wasted through the chimneys. They decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, be self-reliant, and strive for strength. With a revolutionary spirit, they broke free from foreign frameworks and blazed a new trail in producing sulfuric acid from waste gas.

	The great leader Chairman Mao taught: "In the realm of production struggle and scientific experiment, humanity is constantly developing, and nature is constantly developing. It will never stop at a certain level. Therefore, humanity must constantly summarize experiences, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress." In the process of exploring the production of sulfuric acid from waste gas, the workers always carried Chairman Mao's works with them, learning and applying them in the struggle, learning and applying them in practice.

	Can waste gas from smelting with low sulfur dioxide concentration and high dust content be used to produce sulfuric acid? Through repeated study of Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," the workers established a materialist dialectical viewpoint, recognizing that changes in the conditions of raw materials should not be the premise for denying the production of sulfuric acid. Chairman Mao said: "For every form of material motion, one must pay attention to its common points with other forms of motion. However, what is particularly important and forms the basis of our knowledge of things is to pay attention to its special points, that is, to pay attention to its qualitative differences with other forms of motion." Chairman Mao's profound discussion on the universality and particularity of contradictions within things enabled them to further understand the common and special laws of producing sulfuric acid. Using waste gas from metallurgical enterprises to produce sulfuric acid is different from general chemical plants. The production of sulfuric acid must first consider the smelting of metals and adapt to the characteristics of low sulfur dioxide concentration and high dust content in smelting waste gas, rather than requiring smelting to serve the needs of sulfuric acid production. The workers conducted in-depth investigations, continuously practiced, and continuously studied, establishing dialectics and breaking metaphysics. They finally came up with a series of special processes different from general sulfuric acid plants, successfully solving the technical key to producing sulfuric acid from waste gas. They completed the design plan in just one winter.

	The bourgeois technical "authorities," based on their reactionary worldview, always disapproved of and doubted the workers' practice and creativity. They always doubted the possibility of using waste gas with low concentration and high dust content to produce sulfuric acid.

	In early 1964, at a technical review meeting organized by relevant leading departments for this design plan, some bourgeois technical "authorities" again wielded their foreign crutches, making all sorts of difficulties for this newly born design plan, attempting to strangle it in its cradle. They absurdly questioned, "What is the theoretical basis for this design?" Some even ridiculously pulled out a pile of foreign materials shouting, "Look, is there anyone abroad doing it like you?"

	The workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, smartest, and most creative. They paid no heed to the sarcasm and attacks from these "authorities" and "experts." They continued to advance along the correct path indicated by Chairman Mao. During the construction, equipment installation, and trial operation, the workers followed Chairman Mao's teachings on practice, cognition, further practice, and further cognition, continuously improving the process of producing sulfuric acid from waste gas.

	In the first quarter of this year, China's first factory, designed and constructed entirely by itself, using the waste gas containing sulfur from smelting non-ferrous metals to produce sulfuric acid, was finally built and put into production. The high-quality sulfuric acid it produces has been continuously sent to various places, supporting the socialist construction of the motherland.

	In August this year, driven by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers continued to advance, further experimenting with the use of waste gas from a single converter to produce sulfuric acid. This single converter has an even lower concentration of sulfur dioxide waste gas, higher dust content, and is more unstable. It is generally considered internationally that using it to produce sulfuric acid is even more difficult. The bourgeois technical "authorities" estimated that this time they would definitely not be able to overcome the difficulty. However, they were wrong again. The Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought has no insurmountable difficulties. The workers continued to draw wisdom and strength from Chairman Mao's works, pooling their efforts, coming up with ideas, and taking measures. They finally solved this major problem of producing sulfuric acid from waste gas in a short time. The bourgeois technical "authorities" were thoroughly defeated.

	The success of using waste gas from smelting with low concentration and high dust content to produce sulfuric acid once again eloquently proves that Mao Zedong Thought is the sole correct guideline for China's socialist revolution and socialist construction. Mao Zedong Thought is effective wherever it is applied. As long as we truly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, master the most powerful ideological weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, and act according to Mao Zedong Thought, we will be invincible, and we can create any human miracle.

    毛泽东思想武装起来的人民群众最富有创造力
    我国建成国际先进水平的废气制酸厂
    有关冶金企业职工遵照毛主席的教导，以革命精神同资产阶级“权威”进行了针锋相对的斗争，大立辩证法，大破形而上学，成功地利用浓度低、含尘大的冶炼废气制造优质硫酸，为我国多快好省地发展硫酸工业闯出了一条新路。
    据新华社四日讯　我国有关冶金企业职工，按照伟大领袖毛主席关于解放思想、破除迷信的教导，发扬敢想、敢闯、敢创的无产阶级革命精神，同资产阶级技术“权威”进行针锋相对的斗争，建成了具有国际先进水平的我国第一个废气制酸厂，利用冶炼有色金属时的浓度低、含尘大的含硫废气生产出了优质硫酸。这是大灭资产阶级威风、大长工人阶级志气的一曲凯歌，这是伟大的毛泽东思想的又一光辉胜利。
    我国在几年以前，就开始筹建利用废气制造硫酸的工厂。但是，由于受到洋框框的束缚，一直迟迟没有获得什么进展。一些资产阶级技术“权威”、“专家”，根据某些外国书本上的资料和公式，曾经一口咬定，说什么含二氧化硫低、矿尘高而又不很稳定的冶炼废气根本不能造酸。几年来，围绕浓度低、含尘大的冶炼废气能否制酸的问题，展开了很多争论。这看起来是一个技术问题的争论，实质上却是两种世界观，两种方法论，两条工业发展道路的斗争。
    一九六三年下半年，我国有关冶金企业的职工在社会主义教育运动中，革命积极性和创造性大大高涨。他们鉴于国家很需要硫酸，而企业里大量的造酸原料却顺着大烟囱跑掉了，非常痛心，决心要按照毛主席的教导，自力更生，奋发图强，以革命的精神打破洋框框，在废气造酸方面闯出一条我国自己的道路。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。因此，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”在探索废气制酸的过程中，职工们时刻带着毛主席著作，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，在实践中学，在实践中用。
    二氧化硫浓度低、含尘大的冶炼废气能否造酸呢？职工们通过反复学习毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》等著作，树立了唯物辩证的观点，认识到原料气条件的变化不能成为否定制酸的前提。毛主席说：“对于物质的每一种运动形式，必须注意它和其他各种运动形式的共同点。但是，尤其重要的，成为我们认识事物的基础的东西，则是必须注意它的特殊点，就是说，注意它和其他运动形式的质的区别。”毛主席关于事物内部矛盾的普遍性和特殊性的精辟论述，使他们进一步地认识了制造硫酸的共同规律和特殊规律。冶金企业利用废气制酸，不同于一般的化工厂，制酸要首先考虑金属的冶炼，要适应冶炼废气二氧化硫浓度低、含尘高这个特点，而不能要求冶炼服从造酸的需要。职工们深入现场，不断实践，不断研究，大立辩证法，大破形而上学，终于想出了用一系列不同于一般制酸工厂的特殊工艺，成功地解决了废气制酸的技术关键。仅一个冬天就把设计方案制定出来了。
    资产阶级技术“权威”，从他们反动的世界观的本能出发，对工人的实践，工人的创造，总是不赞成，不相信。他们始终怀疑利用浓度低、含尘大的冶炼废气制造硫酸的可能性。
    一九六四年初，在有关领导部门为这个设计方案组织的技术审核会上，一些资产阶级技术“权威”再度挥舞起洋拐棍，对这个新诞生的设计方案，百般刁难，企图把它扼杀在摇篮中。他们荒唐地责问：“这个设计有什么理论根据？”有的还可笑地抱出一大堆洋资料叫嚷：“看看，国外那有像你们这样干的？”
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的职工群众最勇敢、最聪明、最富有创造力。他们毫不理睬这些“权威”、“专家”的讽刺和打击。他们继续沿着毛主席指引的正确道路前进。在施工、设备安装、试车的过程中，职工们遵照毛主席关于实践、认识、再实践、再认识的教导，边干边议边改，使废气造酸的工艺日趋完善。
    今年第一季度，我国第一个自己设计、自己施工的全部利用冶炼有色金属含硫废气制造硫酸的工厂终于建设起来并且投入生产了。它生产的优质硫酸已经源源运往各地，支援祖国的社会主义建设。
    今年八月，在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，职工们继续前进，进一步试验利用单个转炉废气制造硫酸。这种单个转炉因为二氧化硫废气浓度更低，含尘更大，而且更不稳定，在国际上一般认为利用它制酸是更困难的。资产阶级技术“权威”估计这次肯定无法闯过难关了。但是，他们又估计错了。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级没有攻不下的难关，没有克服不了的困难。职工们继续从毛主席著作中汲取智慧和力量，群策群力，出主意，提措施，终于在很短时间内又把这个废气制酸的大难题攻下来了。资产阶级技术“权威”终于彻底地输了。
    利用浓度低、含尘大的冶炼废气制造硫酸的成功，又一次雄辩地证明了：毛泽东思想是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设唯一正确的指针。毛泽东思想用到哪里哪里灵。只要我们真正学好用好毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想这个最强大的思想武器，按照毛泽东思想办事，我们就无往而不胜，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来。
