One autumn night, community member Zhou Xueying couldn't sleep, thinking about how to break through the "three barriers."

A few days earlier, two cadres who had come to work in the village visited her home, hoping she would go to the cultural room to study Chairman Mao's works. Xueying said, "Chairman Mao is our poor and lower-middle peasants' great savior. We love his books the most, but I can't read a single character!" The cadre said, "Not being able to read is fine, you can listen and learn slowly." The next day, Zhou Xueying went to the cultural room and sat in the front row, listening to the story of Norman Bethune and learning "selflessness" phrase by phrase.

Xueying became more and more eager to learn. After studying for five or six days, she paid less attention to household matters. Her husband, Lu Yuanchao, had been resting at home due to illness. Seeing Xueying leaving the household chores to him, he became impatient and said, "A woman, who can't even read, what's the use of studying?" Xueying replied, "What are you saying! If we poor and lower-middle peasants don't study Chairman Mao's books, who will?"

She then left. Yuanchao, seeing that she didn't pay him any mind and left the children for him to take care of, became even more unhappy. The next day, he told Xueying, "I don't oppose your studying, but you should take the three children with you!" "I'm not going to Shanghai or Nanjing to study, so I'll take them with me," she said. In the evening, after Xueying finished her studies, she returned home with the children. Her mother-in-law slowly said, "You have so many things to do, studying and attending meetings, it's so troublesome." The children, husband, and mother-in-law stood as three barriers in front of Xueying, but these difficulties couldn't stop her fervent heart from studying Chairman Mao's works.

One day, Zhou Xueying told her mother-in-law the story of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains. Her mother-in-law said, "We don't have mountains here. If there were mountains, you would want me to dig them away!" Xueying quickly said, "Mom, it's not about digging mountains. You are old, but you should learn the spirit of the Foolish Old Man and help me take care of the children." "Taking care of the children is fine, but why mention the Foolish Old Man?" Xueying patiently said, "Mom, the children are holding me back, and I can't do anything. If you help me take care of the children, you are helping me study and work for the revolution." Although her mother-in-law didn't say anything, she felt that what Xueying said made sense. The next day, when Xueying was about to study again, the eldest child was making a fuss, the second child was pulling at her, and the youngest was hugging her leg. Her mother-in-law quickly took the youngest, smiling and saying to Xueying, "Go, or you'll be late." She also started telling the grandchildren the story of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains.

One day, Xueying saw the director of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association very busy and wanted to quickly finish her chores and go to the meeting. She remembered Chairman Mao's words, "All revolutionary comrades should care for, love, and help each other," so she didn't go home but helped the director cut vegetables. Xueying's children saw this and told their father. When Xueying returned home from her evening study, she found the door locked and no one answering. It turned out that Yuanchao was angry and had locked the door, not letting her in. An argument began. Yuanchao said from inside, "If you want to serve the people, you don't need to sleep." Xueying said, "Chairman Mao teaches us to study hard and do good deeds." Yuanchao said, "You study and do good deeds, but I have to cook for you. Only women cook for men, not men for women!" Xueying said, "That's patriarchal thinking. Chairman Mao led us to overthrow the three big mountains on our heads and also to eliminate this old patriarchal thought. You are sick and can't study, but you don't let others study Chairman Mao's books. Is that right?" Yuanchao couldn't argue with Xueying and had to open the door. Xueying decided to move the mountain of old thoughts in her husband's mind with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains. She said, "Chairman Mao wants us to learn from Norman Bethune and become noble, pure, moral people, people free from low-level tastes, and people beneficial to the people. You are a person of low-level tastes." Xueying also told him some principles from "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People." Yuanchao listened more and more eagerly and asked, "Who said this?" Xueying said, "Chairman Mao said this." Yuanchao, hearing that it was Chairman Mao who said it, took the book from Xueying's hands and started reading. After reading, he blushed and said to his wife, "This book seems to be talking to me." Xueying humorously said, "Chairman Mao speaks in Beijing, and we hear it. Your words, Chairman Mao can also hear. This book is talking to your thoughts."

A few days later, one morning, Xueying was about to get up to cook, but she saw that Yuanchao had already prepared the meal. Xueying was surprised, and Yuanchao said, "You study Chairman Mao's works, and I will too!" Xueying asked, "You didn't go to the cultural room, where did you study?" Yuanchao said, "These days, I have been studying 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' and 'Serve the People' at home. I am sick and can't work, so I cook for you to let you work better." He not only no longer stopped Xueying from studying but also helped her study. Whenever he had free time, he did household chores and actively studied Chairman Mao's works, working hard on his literacy. Before the Spring Festival, to dig water celery for the community members to eat, Yuanchao went to the pond at midnight and worked for several hours. He felt colder and colder, but thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings, a warm current flowed to his heart. The production team selected Yuanchao to be the grain storage manager, and he worked very actively.

Xueying diligently studied and applied the "Three Articles," breaking through the barriers of her mother-in-law, husband, and children, becoming an active member in studying Chairman Mao's works. Now, her whole family has red hearts, and whenever they encounter anything, they strive to do it according to Chairman Mao's words.

    闯“三关”
    朱运山
    一个深秋的夜晚，社员周学英老是睡不着，想着如何闯“三关”。
    几天前，两位来村工作的干部到她家里来，希望她到文化室去参加学习毛主席著作。学英说：“毛主席是我们贫下中农的大救星，他老人家的书我们最热爱，可我一个字不识啊！”这位同志说：“不识字，可以听，可以慢慢学嘛！”第二天，周学英来到了文化室，坐在最前面，听着白求恩的故事，一字一句地学着“毫不利己专门利人”。
    学英越学越爱学。学了五、六天，家里的事关心得少些了。丈夫陆元朝因为有病，这些天在家里休息，他看见学英把家务事扔给自己，心中很不耐烦，就对她说：“一个妇女，又不识字，学了有什么用？”学英听了就说：
  “看你说的什么话！我们贫下中农不学毛主席的书谁来学？”说完就走了。陆元朝见她不理自己，把孩子留给自己管，心中更不高兴了。第二天又对学英说：“你要学习我不反对，你把三个孩子带去！”“我又不是去上海、南京学习，带去就带去。”晚上学英学习完了，抱上小孩回到家，婆婆慢慢腾腾地说：“你事儿真多，又是学习，又是开会，烦死了。”小孩、丈夫、婆婆像三道难关，挡在学英面前，但这些困难却拦不住她学习毛主席著作的一颗火热的心。
    有一天，周学英给婆婆讲起了愚公移山的故事。婆婆一听就说：“我们这儿没有山，如果有山的话，你还要我去挖山啊！”学英急忙说：“妈，不是要你去挖山，你年纪大了，要学习老愚公的精神，帮我带好孩子。”“带小孩就带小孩吧，干嘛说什么老愚公？”学英耐心地说：“妈妈，孩子拖住我，什么也干不了，你要是帮我看孩子，就是帮助我学习和干革命了。”这时婆婆虽然没说什么，心中也觉得说的对。第二天学英又要学习了，大孩子吵着，二孩子拖着妈妈，小三更是抱着妈妈的腿不放。婆婆连忙笑着接过小三，对学英说：“你去吧，不然要迟到了。”她也学着媳妇的样子，给孙子讲起了愚公移山的故事。
    有一天，学英看到贫协主任很忙，要赶紧把家务事作完，去开会。她想起了毛主席的话：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”，就顾不得回家，帮助贫协主任切起菜来。学英的孩子看到了告诉了爸爸。学英晚上学习回来后，房门推不开，敲门也没人理。原来是元朝生气了，关起房门不让进。一场争论开始了。元朝在门里说：“你为人民服务，就不要睡觉好了。”学英说：“毛主席教我们应该努力学习和做好事。”元朝说：“你学习，做好事，叫我给你做饭。只有女人给男人做饭，那有男人给女人做饭的事！”学英说：“你这是夫权思想。毛主席领导我们推翻了压在头上的三座大山，也要破除夫权这种旧思想。你有病不能学习，还不让别人学习毛主席的书，这对吗？”元朝说不过学英，只好把门开开。学英决心以愚公移山的精神搬掉丈夫思想上的一座山，于是她说：“毛主席要我们学习白求恩，做一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。你这样，就是一个低级趣味的人。”学英又给他讲了《为人民服务》中的一些道理，陆元朝越听越爱听，就问这是谁说的？学英说：“这是毛主席说的。”元朝一听是毛主席说的，二话没说，把学英手中的毛主席著作拿来就看，看后他红着脸对妻子说：“这书好像对我说的。”学英风趣地说：“毛主席在北京讲话，我们听到了。你讲的话，毛主席也能听到，这书就是对你的思想说的。”
    几天后的一个早晨，学英正要起来做饭，只见元朝已经把饭做好了。学英很奇怪，元朝却说：
  “你学毛主席著作，我也学嘛！”学英问：“你没有上文化室，哪里去学呢？”元朝说：“这几天，我在家已经学了《纪念白求恩》、《为人民服务》。我有病不能上工，给你烧饭，叫你好好干活。”他不但不再拦阻学英学习，还帮助学英学习，有空就做家务事，自己也积极学习毛主席著作，在用字上下功夫。春节前，为了挖水芹菜给社员吃，元朝半夜里下到塘里，劳动了几个小时。他越呆越冷，可是一想到毛主席的教导，一股暖流热到心上。生产队里选元朝当粮食保管员，他干得很积极。
    学英刻苦地活学活用“老三篇”，闯过婆婆、丈夫、小孩三道关，成了学习毛主席著作积极分子。现在她一家人心里红彤彤的，遇什么事，都努力照着毛主席的话去做。
