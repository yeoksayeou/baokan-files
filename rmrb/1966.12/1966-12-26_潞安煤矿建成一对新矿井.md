	The Lu'an Coal Mine in Shanxi Province has recently completed a pair of large modern mines, which have now officially begun production. This is the fourth pair of modern mines in Shanxi Province to start production this year. From underground coal mining to surface loading and transportation, all processes in this pair of mines are mechanized. Their annual production capacity is 900,000 tons.

	During the construction of these mines, the broad masses of workers have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, and actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking. In the midst of the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers are full of spirit and vigor. They resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's instructions on combining revolution with production, following Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They dare to think, dare to act, and boldly innovate, adopting new technologies. Consequently, they have accelerated the construction progress, ensured the quality of the project, and reduced the construction cost.

    潞安煤矿建成一对新矿井
    新华社太原二十四日电　山西省潞安煤矿最近又建成一对大型现代化矿井，并且正式投入生产。这是山西省今年投入生产的第四对现代化矿井。这对矿井从井下采煤到地面装车外运，全部是机械化的。它的年产量为九十万吨。
    广大职工在建设这对矿井的过程中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛主席著作，促进了人的思想革命化。在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，职工们意气风发，斗志昂扬。他们坚定地执行毛主席、党中央关于抓革命、促生产的指示，遵循毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，敢想，敢干，大胆革新，采用了新技术，因而，加快了建设进度，保证了工程质量，降低了工程成本。
