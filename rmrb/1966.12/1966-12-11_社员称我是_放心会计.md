	Follow Chairman Mao's words, if there are shortcomings, do not be afraid of others pointing them out; as long as the criticism is correct, then resolutely correct it. This is what I did, and the members called me the "Reliable Accountant."

	I am a young intellectual who returned to my hometown in 1961. Not long after returning, everyone saw that my background was good, I was sincere, and I could endure hardship, so they elected me as the accountant. When I heard this, I felt uneasy and my face turned red. How could I be an accountant? I said, "I can't do it!" But everyone trusted me, one person said, "Don't be afraid, let's discuss it together!" Another said, "Everyone will support you!" To not disappoint everyone's hopes, I agreed. At that time, I thought: "There is no difficulty in the world, only those who are determined can overcome it. As long as I work hard, I won't do it badly." I didn't know how to use the abacus, so I studied hard; I didn't know how to keep accounts, so I asked others to teach me. Every night, I kept accounts and calculated until late.

	Unexpectedly, when it came time to publish the work points account, some people started arguing. One said, "My work points were not recorded correctly!" Another said, "My work points were calculated wrong!" Some even said that I was biased and intentionally opposed them. Hearing these words, my enthusiasm cooled down. I thought: No wonder some people say that being an accountant is hard work and doesn't pay off. My spouse also complained to me, saying, "If you didn't have the skills, you shouldn't have taken on the job; now you might as well resign, so you won't be scolded anymore!" I also got stuck in a corner, and with a heavy heart, I went to the brigade to hand in the accounts and resign. At this time, the party branch secretary neither criticized me nor said whether I could resign or not. He just gave me a few books by Chairman Mao, such as "Moving Mountains" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and told me to read them carefully. After returning, I read "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao said: "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism. No matter who points out our shortcomings, we should welcome it." As I read, my face felt hot. I recalculated the work points of those who had objections several times, and indeed there were mistakes. At this time, I thought, I often say that I should follow Chairman Mao's words and serve the people wholeheartedly, but now I have made mistakes in serving the members, and when they point out the problems, I not only do not accept them humbly but also lose heart and have a bad attitude. Is this serving the people wholeheartedly? No, it is not! This is a mistake upon a mistake. At the same time, I also read "Moving Mountains" and received profound education. The old man did not fear difficulties and was able to move two big mountains. When we encounter a little difficulty in our work, we want to give up and not do it. How can this be called a revolutionary youth! We are the descendants of poor peasants, the successors of the revolution. If we do not take on this responsibility, who will? Therefore, I made up my mind to be a good accountant for the revolution.

	From then on, whenever I encountered difficulties, I would consult Chairman Mao's works and discuss with poor and lower-middle peasants. My work became better than before. Now, the members call me the "Reliable Accountant."

    听毛主席的话，有了缺点，就不怕别人批评指出；只要批评得对，就坚决改正。我这样做了，
    社员称我是“放心会计”
    刘子芳
    我是一九六一年回乡的知识青年。回乡后不久，大家见我成份好，人诚实，能吃苦，选我当会计。我一听，心里慌，脸发烧。当会计怎么行呢？我说：“我不行！”但是大伙信得过，这个说：“不要怕，咱们商量着干！”那个说：“大伙给你撑腰！”为了不辜负大家的希望，我答应了。当时我想：“天下无难事，只怕有心人，只要自己认真干，不怕干不好。”不会打算盘，我就用心学；不会记账，就请人教。每晚都记账、算账到深夜。
    谁知我这样实干苦干，到了公布工分账的时候，有的人却吵个不停。这个说：“我的工分没记对！”那个说：“我的工分算错了！”有人甚至说我偏心眼，有意和他们作对。听了这些话，我满心的热劲凉了半截子。我想：怪不得有人说当会计是吃力不讨好。我爱人也埋怨我，说什么：“当初没那个金刚钻，就别揽那烂磁器；现在你干脆辞掉算了，免得再受气！”我也钻了牛角尖，心一横，到大队去交账、辞职。这时，党支部书记既没有批评我，也没有说允许不允许我辞职，只是给了我毛主席的《愚公移山》和《为人民服务》等几本著作，要我好好读。回来后，我就读《为人民服务》。毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。”读着读着，我脸上热辣辣的。我重新把有意见的人的工分算了几遍，果真有差错。这时我就想，自己嘴上经常说要听毛主席的话，“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，可是现在给社员办错了事，人家提出了意见，自己不仅不虚心接受，还灰心丧气，闹情绪，这是全心全意为人民服务吗？不，不是的！这是错上加错。同时，我又读了《愚公移山》，也受到了深刻的教育。愚公不怕困难，能搬走两座大山，咱工作中遇到这点困难就要交“印”不干，这那能算是革命青年！咱是贫农后代，革命接班人，咱不掌这“印”，叫谁掌？于是，我下定决心，要为革命当好会计。
    从此，我每遇到困难，就向毛主席著作请教，就找贫下中农商量，工作比过去做得好了。现在，社员称我是“放心会计”。
