"Thanks to Mao Zedong, He is the Greatest Leader!"
—Recalling the Construction of Tanzania's Shortwave Broadcasting Station with China's Assistance

In the festive atmosphere of Tanzania's celebration of its fifth anniversary of mainland independence, President Nyerere solemnly presided over the inauguration ceremony of Tanzania's shortwave broadcasting station, which was built with China's assistance, on December 7. This station allows the Tanzanian people to clearly listen to their own country's broadcasts for the first time nationwide. At the same time, the station broadcasts the voice of independent Tanzania to the outside world, especially to the people of East, South, and Southwest Africa who are fighting for national independence. Workers on the construction site of the broadcasting station shouted, "Thank you, Chairman Mao, for sending Chinese experts to help us build such a magnificent broadcasting station." A Tanzanian worker named Muhammad said to the Chinese experts, "It is our great honor to have China as a true friend. You have helped us build this magnificent broadcasting station, and the Tanzanian people will benefit from it for generations to come. Thank you, Mao Zedong, he is the greatest leader!"

"The Construction of the New Broadcasting Station is a Revolution"

Last year, when this broadcasting station was about to be built with the help of the Chinese people, another broadcasting station equipped and built with British technology was put into use in this country. The construction of this broadcasting station took two years and cost more than 220,000 pounds, but it did not solve the problem of effective reception of the country's broadcasts nationwide.

Some Western imperialists, upon hearing that the Tanzanian government requested China's assistance in building a new shortwave broadcasting station, told Tanzanian officials that the People's Republic of China's technology was backward and could not build such a broadcasting station. Now, the facts have strongly refuted their slander against China.

The Chinese experts and workers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, cooperated well with the Tanzanian workers and completed the entire project in just nine months. Although the new broadcasting station is much larger in scale than the one built by the British, the total cost is less.

As for the effect of the new broadcasting station, during the more than two months of trial broadcasts since September this year, the Tanzanian Ministry of Information and Tourism has received more than 250 letters from abroad. All these letters expressed great surprise that countries far from Tanzania could clearly receive Tanzanian broadcasts. Some foreign listeners even sent recordings of the Tanzanian broadcasts they received.

Tanzanian government representative Kilinga, who is in charge of this project, said that the construction of the new broadcasting station is a revolution because it was completed in such a short time with such good results. Tanzanian Second Vice President Kawawa recently inspected the precision and modern equipment made in China at this broadcasting station and praised, "China has developed so fast!"

Serving the Tanzanian People Wholeheartedly

When the project started, the Chinese experts and workers encountered many difficulties, such as language barriers and the inability to adapt to the tropical climate. They worked under the scorching sun in the equatorial region for about ten hours a day. Their skin was sunburned, and their clothes were soaked with sweat. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," drawing courage and strength from them. The Chinese experts and workers treated the Tanzanian cause as their own. Wherever there were difficulties, they appeared. They helped the Tanzanian workers lay the transmission cables for the Tanzanian broadcasting station to the broadcasting station. When encountering rivers, the Chinese workers always jumped in first to work. Sometimes when the concrete mixer malfunctioned, the Chinese experts fearlessly climbed in to repair it. Tanzanian workers on the construction site were moved by the selfless spirit of the Chinese workers. They gave a thumbs up and said in Swahili, "Well done!"

The Chinese experts and workers strictly followed the foreign aid policy based on the proletarian internationalist spirit expounded by Chairman Mao Zedong, always putting the interests of the Tanzanian people first and being very frugal during construction.

Tanzanian engineer Mhumbira introduced to visitors to the shortwave broadcasting station that, in addition to the very modern equipment made in China for the shortwave broadcasting station, China also sent many spare parts to the shortwave broadcasting station, enough for several years. However, the Chinese experts and workers always followed the spirit of thrift in construction, saving every penny for the Tanzanian people. They lived in old tents on the construction site, with seven people in each tent. All the tables and chairs in the tents and the simple dining hall were made by the Chinese experts from scrap wood. They used old oil drums to boil water for bathing.

President Nyerere recently inspected the construction site of the broadcasting station and said that the Chinese experts worked hard and lived frugally, which was more important to Tanzania than the project itself. Recently, after Second Vice President Kawawa inspected the site, he wrote in the guest book, "The Chinese experts set a good example of hard work and frugal living."

He pointed out that experts from some countries, however, had to live in luxurious hotels. He praised, "Only like the Chinese experts and workers, that is true work!"

"We Are Truly Close Brothers"

The Chinese experts and workers have deep feelings for their Tanzanian worker brothers. They not only care for each other in life but also selflessly and enthusiastically impart technical knowledge to their Tanzanian brothers. During the construction process, they trained Tanzanian workers of various technical professions and greatly improved their technical level. An old Tanzanian worker who installs water pipes said that he had worked with foreign imperialist experts for more than ten years, but they never let him see the water pipe installation drawings. The Chinese experts not only let him see the drawings but also systematically explained to him how to understand the drawings. Several Tanzanian workers who installed antennas, with the help of Chinese experts, increased their work efficiency several times. When the project ended and they left the construction site, they shed tears, tightly held the hands of their Chinese brothers, and poured out their hearts, saying that they had never seen foreign experts treat them as equals and with such warmth. They said, "We are not just ordinary brothers, we are truly close brothers."

"Thank You, Chairman Mao!"

Recently, when a reporter visited the broadcasting station, a Tanzanian worker named Leonard spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao! Thank you, Chairman Mao! He sent such good Chinese experts to help us build this magnificent broadcasting station." This young man has a deep friendship with the Chinese people. He strives to learn Chinese, and the first words he learned and wrote were "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The Tanzanian workers clearly know that it is the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, who taught the Chinese experts and workers to serve the Tanzanian people wholeheartedly. They have boundless love and respect for Chairman Mao. Whenever Chinese films are shown on the construction site, when Chairman Mao appears on the screen, the Tanzanian workers immediately cheer and applaud enthusiastically. When the color documentary "Chairman Mao and the Million-strong Cultural Revolution Army" was shown, when Chairman Mao in military uniform appeared on the screen, several Tanzanian workers shouted in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Some people sang the song "The East Is Red" along with the music in the movie. One day, several Tanzanian workers saw Chairman Mao's photo in the Chinese version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" that the Chinese experts study every day. They gazed at this photo with great reverence for a long time. They said, "Chairman Mao is truly great!"

### “感谢毛泽东，他是最伟大的领袖！”——记坦桑尼亚广播电台短波发射台在中国帮助下建成

    “感谢毛泽东，他是最伟大的领袖！”
    ——记坦桑尼亚广播电台短波发射台在中国帮助下建成
    在坦桑尼亚人民庆祝他们国家的大陆独立五周年的节日气氛中，尼雷尔总统七日隆重主持在中国帮助下建成的坦桑尼亚广播电台短波发射台的开播典礼。这座电台使坦桑尼亚人民有史以来第一次在全国范围内能够清楚地听到他们本国电台的广播。同时，这座发射台把独立的坦桑尼亚的声音传播到坦桑尼亚国外，特别是东南非、南非和西南非地区那些正在争取民族独立斗争的非洲人民。发射台工地上的坦桑尼亚工人欢呼“感谢毛主席派中国专家到这里来帮助我们兴建了这样一个了不起的发射台”。一个名叫穆罕默德的坦桑尼亚工人对中国专家说：“我们坦桑尼亚人民有中国这样好的真心朋友，这是我们莫大的荣幸。你们帮助我们建造了这座了不起的发射台，坦桑尼亚人民的子子孙孙都将受益。感谢毛泽东，他是最伟大的领袖！”
  “新发射台的建设是一项革命”
    去年，正当这座发射台在中国人的帮助下快要开工兴建的时候，另一座用英国的装备和技术建成的广播发射台正在这个国家投入使用。建设这个广播发射台花了两年时间，耗费了资金超过二十二万英镑，但是，结果还没有解决坦桑尼亚全国有效收听自己国家的电台广播的问题。
    一些西方帝国主义分子听说坦桑尼亚政府要求中国帮助兴建新的短波发射台后，他们对坦桑尼亚官员说，人民中国技术落后，建造不了这样的发射台。现在，事实已经有力地驳斥了他们对中国的诬蔑。
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国专家和工人，同坦桑尼亚工人合作得很好，只用九个月的时间就完成了这个发射台的全部工程。虽然新的发射台规模要比英国建的那个发射台大得多，但成本总额却比英国的少。
    至于讲到新发射台的效果，自今年九月以来的两个多月的试播期间，坦桑尼亚新闻和游览部已收到了来自外国的二百五十多封来信，所有这些来信对远离坦桑尼亚的国家能清楚听到坦桑尼亚电台的广播都感到极为惊讶。其中有些外国听众甚至把收听到的坦桑尼亚广播的录音寄来。
    坦桑尼亚政府负责这一工程的代表乞林马说，新发射台的建设是一项革命，因为建造的时间这么短，而效果这么好。坦桑尼亚第二副总统卡瓦瓦最近视察了这个发射台的中国造的精密和现代化装备之后，赞扬“中国发展得真快！”
    全心全意为坦桑尼亚人民服务
    当工程动工时，中国专家和工人碰到了许多困难，诸如语言的困难和热带气候的不适应。他们在赤道地带炎热的太阳底下每天工作约十小时。他们的皮肤晒焦了，衣服湿透了。他们反复学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》等毛主席著作，从中汲取了勇气和力量。中国专家和工人把坦桑尼亚的事业当成自己的事业，哪里有困难，他们就出现在哪里。他们同坦桑尼亚工人一道去架设坦桑尼亚电台通往发射台的传音电缆。在碰到河流时，中国工人总是首先跳下去工作。有时候混凝土搅拌器出了毛病，中国专家毫不犹豫，毅然钻进去修理。在工地上的坦桑尼亚工人为中国工人的忘我劳动的精神所感动，他们伸出大拇指，用斯瓦希利语说：“好样的！”
    中国专家和工人严格遵守以毛泽东主席所阐明的无产阶级国际主义精神为基础的对外援助政策，总是首先想到坦桑尼亚人民的利益，在施工中很注意节约。
    坦桑尼亚工程师姆洪比拉向参观短波发射台的人介绍说，除了短波发射台的中国制造的非常新式的设备外，中国还给短波发射台运来了许多备用设备，甚至几年都用不完。但是中国专家和工人自己的生活条件，他们总是本着勤俭建设的精神，尽量为坦桑尼亚人民节省每一分钱。他们自己在工地上搭起旧的帐篷，每个帐篷住七个人。帐篷和简陋的餐厅里的全部桌椅都是中国专家自己用废木料做的。他们利用旧油桶来烧水洗澡。
    尼雷尔总统不久以前巡视发射台建筑工地的时候曾说过，中国专家辛勤劳动，生活朴素，对坦桑尼亚来说，是比工程本身更为重要的援助。最近第二副总统卡瓦瓦到那里视察以后在留言簿上写道：“中国专家给我们树立了埋头苦干和生活朴素的好榜样”。
    他指出，某些国家的专家却要住在豪华的大旅馆里。他赞叹说：像中国专家和工人那样“才是真正的工作！”
    “我们是真正亲密的兄弟”
    中国专家和工人对坦桑尼亚工人兄弟怀有深厚的感情，他们不仅在生活上互相亲切关怀，并且毫无保留地热情地向坦桑尼亚兄弟传授技术知识。在施工过程中，他们新培养了坦桑尼亚各种技术工人，大大提高了他们的技术水平。一位安装水管的坦桑尼亚老工人说，他同外国帝国主义专家一起工作了十多年，但是从来不让他看一看安装水管的图纸。中国专家不仅让他看图纸，而且还系统地给他讲解怎样认识图纸。几位架设天线的坦桑尼亚工人由于得到中国专家的帮助，工作效率提高了好几倍。他们在工程结束后离开工地时，含着热泪，紧紧握住中国兄弟的手倾述他们的心里话说，他们从来没有见过外国专家像中国专家那样平等和亲切地对待他们。他们说：“我们不是一般的兄弟，我们是真正亲密的兄弟。”
    “感谢毛主席！”
    记者最近参观发射台时，在那里工作的一位坦桑尼亚工人列昂纳德用中国话对新华社记者说：“毛主席万岁！感谢毛主席！他派了这样好的中国专家来这里帮助我们建设这座了不起的发射台。”这位青年对中国人民怀着深厚的友谊，他努力学习中文，他首先学的和写的是“毛主席万岁！”
    坦桑尼亚工人清楚地知道，是中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，教导中国专家和工人全心全意地为坦桑尼亚人民服务。他们无限热爱和尊敬毛主席。每当在建筑工地上放映中国电影，银幕上出现毛主席的时候，坦桑尼亚工人立即欢呼和热烈鼓掌。当放映彩色纪录影片《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》时，毛主席身穿军装出现在银幕上的时候，几位坦桑尼亚工人用中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！”有些人随着电影里的音乐，唱起歌颂毛主席的歌曲《东方红》来。有一天，几位坦桑尼亚工人从中国专家每天学习的中文版的《毛主席语录》里看到了毛主席的照片，他们以十分敬仰的心情久久地注视着这张照片。他们说：“毛主席真伟大！”
