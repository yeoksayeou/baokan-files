Vietnamese Foreign Ministry and General Staff Strongly Protest U.S. Bombing of Hanoi
Vietnamese People Resolved to Realize Chairman Ho's Call to Defeat American Aggressors

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 3rd, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 3rd, strongly protesting the savage attack by U.S. aircraft on the residential areas of the capital Hanoi on the 2nd. The statement pointed out, "This is a very serious new escalation of the U.S. destructive war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, a new barbaric crime committed against the Vietnamese people, and an unforgivable provocation against the people of the world. The U.S. has once again grossly violated the sovereignty, territory, and security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

The statement said, "The U.S. aggressors attempt, with these heinous acts, to intimidate the spirit of the Vietnamese people and to save themselves from the military and political predicament they have fallen into after suffering heavy defeats by the U.S. expeditionary forces, mercenary forces, and the puppet army in South Vietnam."

The statement pointed out that this crime by U.S. imperialism once again exposed its aggressive and warlike nature, and exposed the deceptive rhetoric of "peace" and "negotiations" by the U.S. authorities.

The statement said: "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly protests and denounces to international public opinion the above-mentioned barbaric aggression by the U.S. government against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

The statement said, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people appeal to the governments and peoples of all countries that love peace and uphold justice to severely condemn the above-mentioned aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism, to strengthen the fighting unity with the Vietnamese people, and to resolutely demand that the U.S. immediately stop its heinous aggression against Vietnam, withdraw all U.S. troops and their mercenary forces from South Vietnam, and respect the various national rights of the Vietnamese people. The statement said, the Vietnamese people have defeated and will definitely defeat the American aggressors. Any escalation of war and any barbaric means by U.S. imperialism will not save it from its inevitable failure.

The statement finally said: The Vietnamese people will realize Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call: "To defend the independence of the motherland, to fulfill the obligations to the peoples who are fighting against U.S. imperialism, our entire people and army will unite as one, endure hardships and sacrifices, and resolutely fight to final victory."

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 3rd, the Liaison Group of the General Staff of the Vietnamese People's Army issued a strong protest on the 3rd against the new war crimes of U.S. aggressor aircraft savagely bombing two residential areas in the capital Hanoi, a residential area in the southern suburbs of Hanoi, and other places in North Vietnam on the 2nd.

Major General Ho Van Lau, head of the Liaison Group, pointed out in an urgent telegram to the International Control Commission in Vietnam, "This is a new escalation and extremely blatant act of aggression by U.S. imperialism in its destructive war against North Vietnam." The telegram said, this action grossly violated the sovereignty, territory, and security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and trampled on all principles of international law. This is also an extremely arrogant provocation against the peace-loving international public opinion.

The telegram said: "This savage bombing incident proves that U.S. imperialism is still stubbornly intensifying and expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, attempting to extricate itself from its increasingly dire predicament in South Vietnam."

The telegram finally said: "The Liaison Group of the General Staff of the Vietnamese People's Army firmly demands that the U.S. government must immediately stop the war of aggression against South Vietnam, immediately stop the bombing and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and withdraw all U.S. troops and their puppet forces and weapons from South Vietnam."
