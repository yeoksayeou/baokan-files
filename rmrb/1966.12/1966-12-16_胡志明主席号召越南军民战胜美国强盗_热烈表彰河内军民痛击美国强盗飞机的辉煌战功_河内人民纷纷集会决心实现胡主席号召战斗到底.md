	NEW DELHI, Dec. 15 (Xinhua) -- Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam wrote a letter to the military and civilians of Hanoi on Dec. 15, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Government of Vietnam, warmly praising their glorious victories in the recent battles against American aggressor planes. He also presented them with a banner reading "Determined to Defeat American Aggressors."

	In his letter, Chairman Ho Chi Minh said, "In recent days, the savage American aggressor planes have been continuously bombing our beloved capital. The military and civilians of Hanoi and other places have shot down many enemy planes, giving the American aggressors the punishment they deserve. At the same time, the people and liberation army in South Vietnam have given the American aggressors fivefold and tenfold blows."

	The letter pointed out, "The more the American aggressors escalate the war, the more severe their defeats. The more vicious they are, the more our people hate them and the more determined they are to defeat them."

	The letter said, "The military and civilians of Hanoi are fighting better and better. In the north, 1,600 American planes have been shot down. Hanoi's fighting is good, production is good, and public order is well maintained."

	Chairman Ho called on the Vietnamese military and civilians to always be vigilant, to fight well, to produce well, and to do well in air defense work, so as to win more and greater victories.

	NEW DELHI, Dec. 15 (Xinhua) -- The heinous crimes of American aggressor planes continuously bombing the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, have aroused the extreme indignation of the heroic people of Hanoi. In recent days, people from all walks of life have held meetings to strongly denounce the American aggressors and resolve to turn their hatred into strength, firmly carry out Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call to action, fight tenaciously, and make every sacrifice to push the war of resistance against America and national salvation to complete victory, together with the people of the whole country.

	On Dec. 14, 800 workers and laborers of Hanoi held a night meeting to angrily condemn the heinous crimes of the American aggressors and to warmly celebrate the glorious victories of the capital's military and civilians. The meeting passed a resolution to the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Government, firmly declaring: "No matter what difficulties we encounter, no matter how fierce the war is, the people of Hanoi will definitely complete the fighting and production tasks."

	More than 300 women representatives also held a meeting. They, on behalf of the 300,000 women of Hanoi, solemnly swore at the meeting: "We will carry out Chairman Ho's sacred call to resist America and save the nation, turn anger into strength, vigorously promote production, actively serve the battle, fear no sacrifice, and together with the people of the whole country, firmly defeat the American aggressors."

	On Dec. 13, the self-defense team members of a certain factory that was bombed by American planes held a protest meeting, armed with guns. The meeting was filled with roars of anger: "Firmly avenge the fallen comrades!" "The blood debt owed by the American aggressors must be repaid with blood!" The self-defense team members unanimously expressed that they would forever remember the blood debt owed by the American aggressors and continue to bravely strike down any daring American air aggressors.

	On Dec. 13 and 14, the people of the Hoan Kiem District, which was continuously bombed by American aggressor planes, and more than 200 self-defense team representatives also held meetings. They angrily shouted with raised arms: "The American aggressors must pay back the blood debt!" "Down with the American aggressors!" The representatives of the Fifth Street section of the severely bombed Phu Nhuan Labor People's Residential Area angrily pointed out at the meeting: "The more bombs the American air aggressors drop in Hanoi and North Vietnam, the deeper our hatred for them, and the greater our determination to completely annihilate the American aggressors. We will definitely fight to the end and strive for final victory!"

	At meetings held in the Ba Dinh District, Dong Da District, and many streets, factories, enterprises, and institutions, the broad masses of cadres and people, with a spirit of revenge, expressed their resolve to fight to the end.

	On the evening of Dec. 14, representatives of various communities in Hanoi also held a meeting. The representatives unanimously expressed that they would firmly stand with the Vietnamese people, resolve to make every sacrifice, and fight to the end to defeat American imperialism.
