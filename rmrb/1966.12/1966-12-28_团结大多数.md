Unite the Majority

Uniting the majority is an important strategic thought of Chairman Mao. Uniting the majority is an important issue that cannot be ignored in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it is also an important issue that we must pay attention to in the current criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Uniting the majority is for the revolution. We revolutionaries advocate uniting the majority because we stand at the highest point, see the overall situation of the revolution, and take the greatest interests of the broadest masses as our starting point. This is a revolutionary policy and strategy.

Uniting the majority, based on an analysis of the economic status of various classes in society and their political attitudes towards the revolution, is the party's policy and strategy, and the party's class line. In any struggle, in promoting any revolutionary movement, we must unite the majority according to the situation and conditions at that time, strive to win over as many allies as possible to struggle and work together with us. Otherwise, none of our struggles can achieve victory. Dogmatists, sectarians, and bookworms do not understand this. They often substitute emotion for policy, directing the spearhead of the struggle towards the backward masses, expanding the scope of attack, and thinking they are successful, but in fact, they are harming the revolutionary cause.

Not understanding the importance of uniting the majority, we cannot achieve revolutionary victory. This has been proven by our party's decades of revolutionary practice. Not paying attention to uniting the majority may lead the movement astray, may direct the spearhead of the struggle towards the masses, and may result in directional and line errors. This has been repeatedly proven by countless facts in the half-year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We unite the majority for the revolution. To achieve the goal of uniting the majority, we must first follow the mass line. The mass line is the revolutionary line. Those who ignore uniting the majority of the masses cannot achieve revolutionary success.

To unite the majority, we must firmly rely on the leftists and strike at a handful of diehard reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries. At present, it means concentrating our firepower on a handful of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road.

To unite the majority, we must win over the middle elements. The key to whether our revolutionary struggle can be victorious lies in the changes among the middle elements and in their ideological orientation.

To unite the majority, we must pay special attention to uniting those who have made mistakes and have admitted their mistakes. The strength and correctness of the revolutionary left wing are not only reflected in the great unity and solidarity of the left wing but also in the effectiveness of winning over the middle elements. Every revolutionary must have a great revolutionary heart, be forgiving towards comrades who have opposed us but have admitted their mistakes, and sincerely help them correct their mistakes, casting aside all personal matters and selfish thoughts, uniting together to make the revolution. In the present day of criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, the revolutionary left wing must sincerely welcome comrades who have made mistakes to return to the correct line, especially for young people, we must help them correct their mistakes and advance together with them.

In a word, to unite the majority, we must have a heart that is fully dedicated to the revolution, arm ourselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and do painstaking ideological work. Only in this way can we unite the majority. Only by uniting the majority and making the revolution together can we be invincible.

The cause of the proletarian revolution requires us to unite the majority. We must be good at uniting the majority. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause "...must be able to work with the absolute majority. Not only should they unite with those who have the same views as themselves, but they should also be good at uniting with those who have different views from themselves, and they should also be good at uniting with those who have opposed themselves and have been proven by practice to have made mistakes." Each of us, as a revolutionary successor, should often use this criterion to measure and transform ourselves.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a new stage of the socialist revolution, a more profound, sharper, and more complex class struggle. By learning as we go, we will certainly learn more. We must follow Chairman Mao through a lifetime of storms and waves, learn to unite the majority, and learn the art of revolutionary struggle.

    团结大多数
    团结大多数，是毛主席的一个重要的战略思想。团结大多数，是无产阶级文化大革命中不可不注意的重要问题，更是我们当前批判资产阶级反动路线需要注意的重要问题。
    团结大多数是为了干革命。我们革命者讲团结大多数，是站在最高处，看到革命的全局，以最广大人民的最大利益为出发点的革命的政策和策略。
    以对社会各阶级的经济地位及其对革命的政治态度进行分析为基础的团结大多数，就是党的政策和策略，就是党的阶级路线。进行任何斗争，推动任何革命运动，都要根据当时的情况和条件团结大多数，尽可能争取一切同盟军和我们共同奋斗，共同努力，否则，我们的任何斗争都不能取得胜利。教条主义者、关门主义者、书呆子不懂得这一点，他们往往以感情代替政策，把斗争的矛头指向了落后的群众，扩大了打击面，自以为得意，其实却败坏了革命事业。
    不懂得团结大多数，就不能获得革命的胜利，这是我们党几十年革命实践所证实了的。不注意团结大多数，就可能把运动引向歧途，就可能把斗争的矛头指向群众，就可能犯方向错误、路线错误，这是半年来无产阶级文化大革命的无数事实所一再证实了的。
    我们为革命团结大多数，干革命必须团结大多数。要达到团结大多数的目的，首先要走群众路线。群众路线就是革命路线。谁忽视了团结大多数群众，谁就不能取得革命的成功。
    要团结大多数，就必须坚定地依靠左派，打击一小撮顽固的反动派、反革命。在当前，就是集中火力打击一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派。
    要团结大多数，就要争取中间派，我们革命斗争能不能胜利，其关键就在于中间派的变动，在于他们思想的向背。
    要团结大多数，还要特别注意团结那些犯过错误并且承认了错误的人。革命左派的力量和正确，不仅表现在左派的大联合、大团结上，而且也表现在争取中间派工作的成效上。我们每一个革命者都要有革命的伟大胸怀，对于反对过自己并已承认了错误的同志要谅解，要诚恳地帮助他们改正错误，丢掉一切个人的东西、一切私心杂念，团结在一起闹革命。在批判资产阶级反动路线的今天，革命左派一定要诚恳地欢迎犯过错误的同志回到正确的路线上来，特别是对于青少年一定要帮助他们改正错误，和他们一道前进。
    一句话，要团结大多数，就要有一颗全心全意为革命的红心，要用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己，做艰苦细致的思想工作。只有这样，我们才能团结大多数，只有团结大多数一道干革命，我们才能无往而不胜。
    无产阶级的革命事业需要我们团结大多数，我们一定要善于团结大多数。我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们，无产阶级革命事业的接班人“……必须是能够团结绝大多数人一道工作的无产阶级政治家。不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。”我们每一个革命接班人，都应该经常用这个条件衡量自己，改造自己。
    无产阶级文化大革命是社会主义革命的新阶段，是一场更深入、更尖锐、更复杂的阶级斗争。边干边学，一定会学到更多的东西。我们要跟着毛主席在大风大浪里闯一辈子，学会团结大多数，学会进行革命斗争的艺术。
