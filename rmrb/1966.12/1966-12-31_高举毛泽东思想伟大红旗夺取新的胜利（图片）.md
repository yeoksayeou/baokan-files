The people of the entire nation enthusiastically respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, determined to diligently and painstakingly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought, and forging themselves into steadfast revolutionary warriors of the proletariat. This is a group of Red Guards listening to Comrade Mao's good worker, Wei Fengying (center), sharing her experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

The People's Liberation Army is a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. All military units hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the Four Firsts, and vigorously promote the study of living thoughts, using Mao Zedong Thought to answer and solve the real problems of the troops. This is the party branch of a certain air force unit actively mobilizing the masses to study Chairman Mao's quotations with their problems in mind.

Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guiding principle for revolution and construction, and it is the source of victory for all our undertakings. The revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution more resolutely implement Chairman Mao's wise decision to break the foreign framework and walk our own path of industrial development, achieving a comprehensive leap in production. This is a worker at the first steel plant blowing oxygen to smelt steel in an open-hearth furnace.

When the great Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become a tremendous material force. The broad masses of rural cadres and community members study and apply Chairman Mao's works, devoting themselves to revolutionary farming, and have achieved a good harvest this year. This is the community members of Huangshandong Production Brigade in Boluo County, Guangdong Province, together with the People's Liberation Army soldiers who came to support the autumn harvest, joyfully reaping the late rice.

Under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this year our country's cotton-producing areas in the south and north have universally increased production. The broad masses of community members enthusiastically sell new cotton to the state, supporting socialist construction and the world revolution. This is the community members of Yuncheng County, Shandong Province, selling mountains of cotton to the procurement station.

The hundreds of millions of militiamen in our country diligently learn from the People's Liberation Army, hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further strengthen their war preparedness, and are ready at any time, together with the Liberation Army, to annihilate any daring invaders in the vast ocean of people's war. This is the militiamen of the Kaifeng Chemical Fertilizer Factory in Henan Province studying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" during their training.

    全国人民热烈响应林彪同志的号召，决心认真地、刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，把自己锻炼成为坚强的无产阶级革命战士。这是红卫兵小将们在请毛主席的好工人尉凤英（中）介绍她活学活用毛主席著作的经验。
    人民解放军是毛泽东思想的大学校。全军各部队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持四个第一，大抓狠抓活思想，用毛泽东思想回答和解决部队的现实问题。这是空军某部党支部，积极发动群众，带着问题学习毛主席语录。　　何名泰、周平沛摄
    毛泽东思想是革命和建设的根本，是我们一切事业胜利的源泉。鞍钢革命职工在无产阶级文化大革命中，更坚决地贯彻执行毛主席提出的打破洋框框，走自己工业发展道路的英明决策，实现了生产的全面跃进。这是第一炼钢厂工人在平炉前吹氧炼钢。
    伟大的毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成巨大的物质力量。广大农村干部和社员，活学活用毛主席著作，一心为革命种田，夺得了今年农业生产的好收成。这是广东省博罗县黄山洞大队的社员和前来支援秋收的人民解放军战士一起喜收晚稻。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，今年我国南北棉区普遍增产。广大社员踊跃向国家交售新棉，支援社会主义建设，支援世界革命。这是山东郓城县社员向收购站交售的棉花堆积如山。
