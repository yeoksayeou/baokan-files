Thousands of Red Guards and revolutionary students from middle schools in Guangzhou held a rally and protest march this morning to strongly condemn the bloody crimes of Portuguese imperialism in Macau, which has massacred fellow countrymen, and to firmly support the just struggle of patriotic compatriots in Macau.

The meeting issued a stern warning to the Portuguese authorities in Macau: We will not allow you to use any deceitful tactics. You must immediately and completely implement the four demands put forward by the Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee, and completely and thoroughly accept all the just demands put forward by the compatriots in Macau, especially the six serious demands recently proposed by representatives from various sectors in Macau. Otherwise, you will reap what you sow.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Guangzhou on the 14th, in recent days, militia members, workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres from various parts of Guangdong Province have continued to hold rallies and protest marches to condemn the heinous crimes of Portuguese imperialism in Macau, which has massacred fellow countrymen, and to firmly support the just struggle of compatriots in Macau against oppression.

The broad masses of rural militia in Guangdong Province are filled with indignation at the bloody atrocities committed by the Portuguese authorities in Macau. They sternly warn the Portuguese authorities in Macau: You must completely and thoroughly implement the four demands put forward by the Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee and all the just demands put forward by the compatriots in Macau. If you continue to use deceitful tactics and delay, all serious consequences that arise from this will be the full responsibility of the Portuguese authorities in Macau.

At a condemnation meeting held by people from various sectors in Taishan County, representatives from workers and farmers in Taicheng Town expressed their full support for the statement issued by the Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee. They also sternly warned the Portuguese authorities in Macau: You must immediately stop all acts of killing fellow countrymen in Macau, severely punish the culprits, and apologize to and compensate the families of the victims for all losses.

Several dozen active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the public security system in Shaoguan Prefecture said: The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. If the Portuguese authorities in Macau continue to create incidents and oppress our compatriots in Macau, the 700 million people of China will mercilessly smash your backbone.
