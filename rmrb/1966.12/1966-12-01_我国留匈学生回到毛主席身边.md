A thousand people from the capital gathered at the station to hold a welcoming rally, strongly protesting the despicable behavior of the Hungarian government in following the Soviet revisionists' anti-China stance and unjustly ordering our students studying in Hungary to return home.

New China News Agency, 30th November: The five Chinese students who were unjustly ordered to return home by the Hungarian government today returned triumphantly from the frontline of the anti-revisionist struggle to the great motherland and to the side of our great leader Chairman Mao. More than a thousand workers, Red Guards, and cadres from the capital, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with his quotations, gathered at Beijing Railway Station, enthusiastically welcoming the glorious anti-revisionist fighters returning home. They held a welcoming rally at the station, strongly protesting the Hungarian government's unilateral violation of the Sino-Hungarian cultural cooperation agreement, further worsening the relations between the two countries. They pointed out that the Hungarian government, following the Soviet revisionists' anti-China stance, would meet a miserable end. Today, Beijing Railway Station was filled with a strong revolutionary atmosphere. Huge portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao were hanging high on the station buildings, and large red banners read: "Defend Marxism-Leninism, carry the struggle against modern revisionism through to the end!" The welcoming crowd continuously shouted slogans such as: "Long live the great Communist Party of China!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" and sang revolutionary songs.

At 4:30 PM, when the "East Wind" international train carrying the five anti-revisionist fighters slowly entered the station, the platform was in a state of excitement, with the sound of slogans and drums shaking the heavens. Our five students studying in Hungary, holding high a portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and a banner reading "Advance bravely under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought," stepped out of the train. Vice Minister of Higher Education, Luo Fan, Director of the Soviet and Eastern European Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yu Zhen, and other relevant officials, including Jin Guangzu, Liu Ziyu, Wei Jingling, and Liu Shumao, warmly shook hands with them and expressed their sincere greetings. The five students studying in Hungary excitedly shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The welcoming rally began with everyone singing "The East Is Red" and opening their red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," reciting Chairman Mao's teachings: "I think that for a person, a party, an army, or a school, if they are not opposed by the enemy, that would be bad; that would mean they have gone over to the enemy's side. If they are opposed by the enemy, that would be good; that would mean they have drawn a clear line of demarcation with the enemy. If the enemy vigorously opposes us, slandering us as utterly bad and worthless, that would be even better; that would mean we not only have drawn a clear line of demarcation with the enemy but also that our work has achieved great successes." The Red Guards from the capital affectionately pinned Mao badges and Red Guard armbands on the glorious anti-revisionist fighters.

Luo Fan spoke at the rally. He pointed out that the Hungarian government's unjust expulsion of our students studying in Hungary was a shameful incident that violated the Sino-Hungarian cultural cooperation agreement and further worsened relations between the two countries. He said that the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, turning black into white, claimed that the Chinese government had "unilaterally" decided not to allow Hungarian students to continue studying in China, and described the Red Guards' posting of big-character posters protesting the Hungarian government's expulsion of our students as "improper interference" with the normal activities of the Hungarian embassy in China, attempting to shift the blame for their despicable behavior in damaging relations between the two countries. However, lies cannot cover up the truth. The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' slander against the Chinese government and the Red Guards only makes their crimes more apparent.

He said that the Hungarian government's expulsion of our students studying in Hungary was not an isolated incident. Recently, Hungarian publications have published a large number of anti-China articles, maliciously distorting, slandering, and attacking our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and our domestic and foreign policies. This is their latest manifestation of following the Soviet revisionist leadership's anti-China stance. He emphasized that those who oppose China will meet a miserable end, and the Hungarian government's following the Soviet revisionists' anti-China stance will also meet a miserable end.

He said that the Hungarian leadership expelled you because they were afraid that you would spread the great Mao Zedong Thought among Hungarian youth and the Hungarian people. However, truth cannot be suppressed, and the great Mao Zedong Thought cannot be suppressed. The Hungarian leadership's vigorous opposition to you is not because you did something wrong, but because you did something right.

Luo Fan warmly hoped that the returning students studying in Hungary would respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call, actively participate in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, undergo the trials of class struggle, and experience the great mass movement. In the struggle, they should study and apply Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology, establish Mao Zedong Thought, firmly defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and resolutely defend the Party Central Committee, defend Chairman Mao, and defend Mao Zedong Thought.

Amidst enthusiastic applause, Liu Ligui, a representative of the students studying in Hungary, spoke with deep emotion. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao for his earnest guidance and meticulous care, and to the people of the motherland for their strong support and warm welcome.

Liu Ligui, with ample facts, exposed the Hungarian government's unreasonable and despicable behavior in depriving them of their right to study, and expressed his strong indignation and protest.

He said that the Hungarian government's arbitrary and unreasonable actions also drew condemnation from the Hungarian people and foreign students studying in Hungary. Many Hungarian students, teachers, and workers expressed their indignation upon hearing the news, believing it to be "disgraceful." Some even said, "Please do not blame the Hungarian people. We do not agree with our government's unreasonable actions. If this matter were to be put to a vote among Hungarian youth and students, I am sure the vast majority would vote against it. This is the decision of the higher-ups, and we are not satisfied with it." They bid us farewell with reluctant hearts, saying, "We will always stand with the Chinese people," and asked us to convey their greetings to the Red Guards.

Liu Ligui revealed that the Hungarian government's efforts to expel the five students studying in Hungary were a result of their consistent following of the Soviet revisionists' anti-China stance, fearing revolution, and fearing Mao Zedong Thought. As many Hungarian classmates told us, "The Hungarian government has no independent policy. Since Moscow has expelled Chinese students, how can the Hungarian government not follow suit and expel you?" A Hungarian worker said, "The Hungarian government is afraid of Chinese youth spreading Marxist-Leninist ideology among Hungarian youth, afraid of Hungarian youth advancing together with Chinese youth."

He, on behalf of the five students returning from Hungary, promised the people of the motherland: We will definitely study Chairman Mao's books more diligently, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. He said, We must always remember the teachings of our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, to care about state affairs, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! We must firmly support the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. We must actively throw ourselves into the great tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and together with revolutionary teachers and students across the country, temper and transform ourselves in the great winds and waves, and become true successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

During their speeches, the crowd repeatedly shouted slogans such as "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism!" At the end of the rally, everyone sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

The five students studying in Hungary, on their way back from Hungary through the Soviet Union and Mongolia, received a warm welcome from the staff of the Chinese embassy in the Soviet Union and the Chinese embassy in Mongolia. When they arrived in Erlian, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, they were warmly welcomed by local party and government officials and Red Guards.

    热烈欢迎光荣的反修战士胜利归来
    我国留匈学生回到毛主席身边
    首都一千多人在车站举行欢迎大会，强烈抗议匈牙利政府追随苏修反华、无理勒令我留学生回国的卑劣行为。
    新华社三十日讯　被匈牙利政府无理勒令回国的我国五名留匈学生，今天下午从反修斗争前线胜利回到了伟大祖国的首都，回到了我们伟大领袖毛主席身边。
    一千多名首都工人、红卫兵小将和机关干部，高举毛主席像和毛主席语录牌，敲锣打鼓，聚集在北京车站，热烈欢迎光荣的反修战士胜利归来。他们在车站举行的欢迎会上，强烈抗议匈牙利政府片面破坏中匈文化合作协定，进一步恶化中匈两国关系的卑劣行为。他们指出，匈牙利政府追随苏联修正主义反华，是决不会有好下场的。今天下午，北京车站充满着强烈的革命气氛。月台建筑物上高悬伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，挂着大幅红色标语，上面写着：“保卫马克思列宁主义，把反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底！”前来欢迎的人们不停地高呼：“伟大的中国共产党万岁！”“伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”并且齐唱革命歌曲。
    下午四时半，当我国“东风号”国际列车载着五名反修战士徐徐进入车站，月台上一片欢腾，口号声锣鼓声震天动地。我五名留匈学生双手捧着伟大领袖毛主席画像，擎着“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进”的横幅标语走出车厢。前来迎接他们的高等教育部副部长段洛夫，外交部苏联东欧司司长余湛，以及有关方面负责人金光祖、刘子余、魏景玲、刘树茂等，同他们热烈握手，向他们表示亲切慰问。五名留匈学生激动地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    欢迎大会开始后，大家高唱《东方红》，并打开红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，齐声朗读毛主席的教导：“我认为，对我们来说，一个人，一个党，一个军队，或者一个学校，如若不被敌人反对，那就不好了，那一定是同敌人同流合污了。如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”首都红卫兵亲热地给光荣的反修战士佩戴毛主席像章和红卫兵袖章。
    段洛夫在会上讲话。他指出，匈牙利政府无理赶走我留匈学生，是破坏中匈文化合作协定，进一步恶化两国关系的可耻事件。他说，匈牙利外交部颠倒黑白，竟说我国政府“片面”决定不让匈学生继续到中国学习，还把我红卫兵贴大字报抗议匈政府赶我留学生的正义行动说成是“不成体统的干扰”匈驻华使馆的正常活动，企图为自己破坏两国关系的卑劣行为开脱责任。但是，谎言掩盖不了真理，匈牙利外交部对中国政府和中国红卫兵的诽谤，只能是欲盖弥彰。
    他说，匈牙利政府赶我留学生不是孤立的事件。最近期间，匈牙利报刊还发表了大量的反华文章，肆意歪曲、诬蔑和攻击我国无产阶级文化大革命和我国内外政策。这是他们追随苏联修正主义领导集团反华的最新表现。他强调指出，凡是反华的人都没有好下场，匈牙利政府追随苏联修正主义反华也决不会有好结果。
    他说，匈牙利领导集团赶走你们，是因为害怕你们把伟大的毛泽东思想传播给匈牙利青年和匈牙利人民。但是，真理是封锁不住的，伟大的毛泽东思想是封锁不了的。匈牙利领导集团这样起劲地反对你们，不是你们做错了，而是你们做对了。
    段洛夫热烈希望归国的留匈学生响应毛主席和党中央的号召，积极参加这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，经阶级斗争的风雨，见群众运动的世面。在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，誓死保卫党中央，誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫毛泽东思想。
    在热烈的掌声中，我留匈学生代表刘立贵怀着激动的心情讲话。他衷心感激伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席对他们的殷切教导和无微不至的关怀，感激祖国人民对他们的大力支持和热烈欢迎。
    刘立贵以充分的事实揭露了匈牙利政府蛮不讲理，用卑劣的手段剥夺他们学习权利的可耻行为，并且表示极大的愤慨和强烈抗议。
    他说，匈牙利政府这种蛮横无理的做法，也遭到了匈牙利人民和外国留匈学生的谴责。许多匈牙利学生、教员、工人听到这一消息后纷纷表示愤慨，认为这是“不体面的”，有的还说：“请不要怪罪我们匈牙利人民，我们是不同意我们政府这种无理做法。如果这件事要在匈牙利青年学生中表决的话，我肯定绝大多数是会投反对票的。这是上面领导人的决定，我们是不满意的。”他们怀着依依不舍的心情和我们告别，说：“我们永远和中国人民站在一起”，并且要我们转达匈牙利青年对红卫兵的问候。
    刘立贵揭露说，匈牙利政府之所以要千方百计地把我们五名留匈学生赶走，是他们一贯追随苏联修正主义反华、害怕革命、害怕毛泽东思想的必然结果。正像许多匈牙利同学对我们说的那样：“匈牙利政府没有独立的政策，既然莫斯科已经赶走了中国留学生，匈牙利政府怎么能不紧跟着赶你们呢？”一个匈牙利工人说：“匈牙利政府害怕中国青年在匈牙利青年中宣传马克思列宁主义思想，害怕匈牙利青年和中国青年一道前进。”
    他代表五名回国的留匈学生向祖国人民保证：一定要更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。他说，我们一定要牢牢记住我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的教导，要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！我们要坚决拥护以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线。我们要积极投身到伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的洪流中去，和全国革命师生一道，在大风大浪中锻炼自己，改造自己，做个真正的无产阶级革命事业的红色接班人。
    在他们讲话的时候，人们一再高呼：“打倒美帝国主义”、“打倒现代修正主义”等口号。大会结束时，全体高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
    我五名留匈学生由匈牙利回国途中路经苏联和蒙古的时候，受到了我驻苏联大使馆和驻蒙古大使馆工作人员的热烈迎送。他们回到内蒙古自治区二连浩特市时，受到当地党政负责人和红卫兵小将热情欢迎。
