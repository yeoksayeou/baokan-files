Hanoi grandly celebrated the sixth anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The Vietnamese people resolutely fight to achieve complete victory. Chairman Ho Chi Minh and other party and government leaders attended a reception held by Comrade Nguyen Van Tien, head of the permanent delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to North Vietnam.

According to the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 19th, Comrade Nguyen Van Tien, head of the permanent delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to North Vietnam, held a reception in Hanoi on the evening of the 19th to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh and other party and government leaders of Vietnam, including Le Duan, Le Duan, Pham Van Dong, Vo Nguyen Giap, Nguyen Duy Trinh, Le Quy Don, Tran Huy Lieu, and Phan Huy Quat, attended the reception.

Ambassador Zhu Qifeng of China to Vietnam and diplomatic envoys from other countries also attended the reception.

Comrade Nguyen Van Tien first spoke at the reception. He said that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has actually taken on the functions of a government, its international prestige and status are constantly improving, and it has been recognized by many governments and the vast progressive people of the world as the sole true representative of the 14 million people of South Vietnam. In the life-and-death struggle against the most ferocious U.S. imperialism, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam leads the people of South Vietnam to advance from one victory to another.

Nguyen Van Tien said that the U.S. imperialists' consecutive bombings of the North, intensification of attacks on the capital Hanoi, and the crime of "escalating" the war have aroused the extreme indignation and hatred of the people in the South. To liberate the South, defend the North, and achieve the reunification of the country, to fulfill the internationalist duty to the peoples of all nations in the world who are resisting U.S. imperialism, the military and people of the South actively responded to Chairman Ho's sacred call on July 17 this year and the call of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on October 27, fearing neither hardship nor sacrifice, and regardless of how long the resistance lasts, they are determined to advance bravely, eliminate the American aggressors and their lackeys, and resolutely achieve victory and strive for independence and freedom.

Then, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Vietnamese Government, Nguyen Duy Trinh, also spoke at the meeting. He said that the National Liberation Front is the leader, organizer, and inspirer of the people of the South in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. Under the leadership of the National Liberation Front, the heroic people of the South have foiled the U.S. imperialists' plot to implement a new colonialist policy in South Vietnam, defeated its "special war," and are initially defeating its partial war.

He pointed out that the people of the North are united with the people of South Vietnam, resolutely fulfill their duty to the rear for the front, and in any situation, resolutely resist the American aggressors, defend the North, liberate the South, and reunify the country.

He said that the U.S. imperialists mistakenly believe that they can shake the Vietnamese people's resolve to resist American aggression and force the Vietnamese people to surrender to them with bombs. They are gravely mistaken. The Vietnamese people are determined to carry out Chairman Ho's sacred call on July 17, to fulfill their internationalist duty to the country and to the peoples of all nations in the world who are resisting U.S. imperialism, for the peace of Indochina, Asia, and the world, to fear neither difficulties nor sacrifices, to resolutely fight, and to resolutely achieve victory, and they will surely defeat the American aggressors.

According to the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 19th, representatives of various circles in Hanoi held a grand meeting on the evening of the 18th to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Vietnamese National Resistance Day (December 19), the sixth anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (December 20), and the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese People's Army (December 22). They also warmly welcomed the newly established permanent delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to North Vietnam.

Le Duan, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, Political Bureau member and Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Duy Trinh, Nguyen Van Hien, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front and Chairman of the Vietnam General Federation of Labor, Nguyen Van Hien, Chairman of the Committee for the Reunification of the Fatherland, and General Do Hau, Director of the General Political Department of the Vietnamese People's Army, and other Vietnamese party, government, and military leaders attended the meeting.

The permanent delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to North Vietnam, headed by Comrade Nguyen Van Tien, a member of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, also attended the meeting.

Le Duan, in his opening remarks, called on the military and people to carry forward the spirit of national unity, long-term resistance, and resolute victory. He called on them to resolutely carry out Chairman Ho's battle call on July 17 this year, to fear neither hardship nor sacrifice, and to resolutely fight to the end.

Then, Nguyen Van Hien spoke at the meeting. He said: We, the people of the North, always long for our beloved South and the 14 million fellow countrymen there. We assure our fellow countrymen in the South that no matter how far the American aggressors expand their war of aggression, the 17 million people of the North will remain steadfast in fulfilling our duty to the rear for the front, and together with our fellow countrymen in the South, we will resolutely defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys and strive for complete victory.

Comrade Nguyen Van Tien also spoke at the meeting.

The meeting adopted a resolution expressing confidence that with the close unity of the people of North and South Vietnam, the powerful people's armed forces skilled in people's war, and the active support of the peace-loving people of the world, the Vietnamese people will surely win, and U.S. imperialism will surely fail.

The meeting ended with the slogan "Determined to defeat the American aggressors" and the battle song "Liberate the South."

    河内隆重庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立六周年
    越南人民坚决战斗到彻底胜利
    胡志明主席等党政领导人出席阮文进团长举行的庆祝招待会
    据新华社河内十九日电　越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团团长阮文进，十九日晚上在河内举行招待会，庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立六周年。
    胡志明主席和越南其他党政领导人黎笋、长征、范文同、范雄、武元甲、阮维桢、黎清毅、陈国环、潘继遂等出席了招待会。
    中国驻越南大使朱其文和其他国家的外交使节也出席了招待会。
    阮文进团长首先在招待会上讲了话。他说，越南南方民族解放阵线实际上已经负起了一个政权机构的职能，它在国际上的威信和地位不断提高，并且获得了许多国家政府和全世界广大进步人民公认为一千四百万越南南方人民唯一真正的代表。在同最凶恶的美帝国主义进行你死我活的斗争中，越南南方民族解放阵线引导着越南南方人民不断前进，从一个胜利走向一个胜利。
    阮文进说，美帝国主义接连轰炸北方，加强袭击首都河内，杀害我国同胞的战争“升级”罪行，激起了南方同胞无比愤慨和仇恨。为了解放南方，保卫北方，统一祖国的事业，为了履行对正在反对美帝国主义的世界各民族的国际主义义务，南方军民积极响应胡主席今年七月十七日的神圣号召和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团十月二十七日的号召，不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲，不管抗战延长多久，决心奋勇前进，消灭美国侵略强盗及其走狗，坚决夺取胜利，坚决争取独立和自由。
    接着越南政府副总理兼外交部长阮维桢在会上也讲话。他说，民族解放阵线是南方同胞进行抗美救国斗争的领导者、组织者和鼓舞者。在民族解放阵线的领导下，英雄的南方同胞挫败了美帝国主义妄图在南越实现新殖民主义政策的阴谋，战胜了它的“特种战争”和初步战胜了它的局部战争。
    他指出，北方人民同越南南方人民团结一致，坚决完成大后方对大前线的义务，在任何情况下也坚决抗击美国侵略强盗，保卫北方，解放南方，统一祖国。
    他说，美帝国主义妄想用炸弹来动摇越南人民抗美救国的决心，迫使越南人民向它投降。它大错而特错了。越南人民决心实现胡主席七月十七日的神圣号召，为了履行对祖国和对正在抗击美帝国主义的世界各民族的国际主义义务，为了印度支那、亚洲和世界的和平，不怕困难，不怕牺牲，坚决战斗，坚决夺取胜利，并且必将战胜美国侵略强盗。
    据新华社河内十九日电　河内市各界人民代表十八日晚上隆重集会，纪念越南全国抗战日二十周年（十二月十九日）、越南南方民族解放阵线成立六周年（十二月二十日）、越南人民军建军节二十二周年（十二月二十二日），并且热烈欢迎新设立的越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团。
    越南劳动党中央政治局委员、国会常务委员会主席长征，政治局委员、政府副总理阮维桢，越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团委员、越南总工会主席黄国越，政府统一委员会主任阮文咏，越南人民军总政治局主任双豪中将等越南党政军负责人出席了大会。
    以越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会委员阮文进为首的越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团也出席了大会。
    长征在致大会开幕词时号召军民要发扬全民团结，长期抗战，坚决夺取胜利的精神，坚决实现胡主席今年七月十七日的战斗号召。不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决战斗到彻底胜利。
    接着，黄国越在大会上讲话。他说：我们北方同胞时刻都向往着可爱的南方，向往着南方的一千四百万骨肉同胞。我们向南方同胞保证，无论美国强盗把侵略战争要扩大到什么地步，一千七百万北方同胞仍然一心一意地坚决履行大后方对大前线的应尽的义务，同南方同胞一道坚决战胜美国强盗及其走狗，争取彻底胜利。
    阮文进团长也在会上讲了话。
    大会通过一项决议，表示坚信：有着越南南北两方人民的紧密的团结，有着善于进行人民战争的强大的人民武装力量，并且得到世界上爱好和平人民的积极支持，越南人民一定胜利，美帝国主义一定失败。
    大会最后在“决心战胜美国侵略强盗”的口号声和《解放南方》的战歌声中结束。
