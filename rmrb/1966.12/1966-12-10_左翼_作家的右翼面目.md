The right-wing face of "left-wing" writers

	Slandering the Boxers as "Boxer Bandits"

	In 1935, Xia Yan, in his play "Sai Jin Hua," slandered the Boxers, who bravely fought against imperialism, as "Boxer chaos," claiming they were "disorganized mobs," "a primitive peasant uprising, superstitious of divine power, without clear political ideas." He even said the Boxers were "tools for a few Qing nobles to fight for leadership."

	In 1936, Xia Yan, in his play "Qiu Jin," continued to slander the Boxers as "Boxer bandits," referring to the Taiping Army as "long-haired rebels," and calling the Boxers "spreaders of rumors and deception."

	Shamelessly Praising the Enemy of the People, Chiang Kai-shek

	In 1944, Xia Yan praised the reactionary Kuomintang government as "wise authorities," begging the Kuomintang to "pay more attention to us and help us more effectively and concretely."

	In the article "Shanghai in Battle," Xia Yan even expressed concern for the safety of the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, during the Xi'an Incident. He shamelessly said: "December 25 is the day Chiang Kai-shek escaped from Xi'an, which can also be said to be a day that modern Chinese history will never forget..."

	Crying for the Japanese Invaders

	When a Japanese invader died, Xia Yan thought this enemy's death was the "most tragic" and shed tears for this "innocent" casualty. He also sympathized with all the dead Japanese invaders: "These materials, letters, and diaries were mostly taken from the bodies of the enemy, some stained with blood, some pierced by our bullets. These sad relics made me gloomy, made me pity them. Several times I could not bear to finish reading the sad documents..."

	Singing Praises for American Imperialism

	Xia Yan had a strong admiration for American imperialism. In 1942, he said: "In America, there is excitement, youth, naivety, barbarism, and joy..."

	In another article, he obsequiously sang praises: "I close the book and look at the horizon. That side (referring to America) is a fertile land of joy, a free country. Whenever we mention this place, we think of freedom, joy, and abundance."

	Fabricating History to Attack Lu Xun

	As early as the 1930s, Xia Yan, together with Zhou Yang, attacked Lu Xun. In August 1957, at the expanded meeting of the Chinese Writers' Association Party Group, he reversed the verdict on Zhou Yang's "National Defense Literature," pretending to be a "victim," and accused Lu Xun. He said Lu Xun did not listen to Zhou Yang and others' opinions and "arbitrarily carried out activities to split the left-wing cultural movement."

	In 1961, when talking to the film crew of "The Life of Lu Xun," Xia Yan maliciously belittled Lu Xun, saying Lu Xun was "even in the early days of the League of Left-Wing Writers, still as a fellow traveler of the revolution." He openly contradicted Chairman Mao's high evaluation of Lu Xun.

    “左翼”作家的右翼面目
     诬蔑义和团是“拳匪”
    一九三五年，夏衍在《赛金花》里，把不屈服于帝国主义而进行英勇斗争的义和团诬蔑为“拳乱”，“是无组织的乌合之众”，“是一种原始的农民暴动，迷信神权，没有明确的政治思想”，硬说义和团是“替几个清室贵族争夺领导权的工具”。
    一九三六年，夏衍写《秋瑾》时，仍把义和团诬蔑为“拳匪”，称太平军是“长毛”，说义和团是“造谣惑众的”。
      无耻歌颂人民公敌蒋介石
      一九四四年，夏衍吹捧国民党反动政府是“贤明的当局”，恳求国民党“更多地注意我们，而且更有效更切实地帮助我们。”
    在《上海在战斗》一文中，夏衍竟对人民公敌蒋介石在西安事变中的安全表示关切。他无耻地说：“十二月二十五日这一天，是蒋先生西安脱险的纪念，也可以说是近代中国历史上一个永远不会忘记的日子……”。
      为日本侵略军伤心洒泪
    一个日本侵略兵战死了，夏衍却认为这个敌人的死是“最惨痛”的“悲剧”，并为这个“无辜的战死”者淌了眼泪。他还同情所有战死了的日本侵略军：“这些材料，信札和日记，大都是从敌人的尸体上搜来的，有的染着血迹，有的被我们的子弹穿过，这些惨淡的遗物使我黯然，使我悲悯，有几次我终于不忍读完那悲楚的文件……”。
      为美帝国主义大唱赞美诗
    夏衍十分向往美帝国主义，他在一九四二年说：“在美国，有的是兴奋，年青，稚气，野蛮和愉快……”。
    在另一篇文章里，他又肉麻地大唱赞美诗：“我合上书望着天边。天的那方（指美国）是一块富饶的乐土，是一个自由的乡邦。……我们一提起这地方的名字就联想到自由、欢悦和丰饶。”
    捏造历史攻击鲁迅
    早在三十年代，夏衍就伙同周扬围攻鲁迅。一九五七年八月，他在中国作家协会党组扩大会议上，为周扬他们一伙的“国防文学”翻案，装出一副“受害者”的姿态，对鲁迅进行“控诉”。说鲁迅当时不听周扬等人的意见，“恣肆地进行了分裂左翼文化运动的罪恶活动。”
    一九六一年，夏衍同电影《鲁迅传》摄制组谈话时，还别有用心地贬低鲁迅，说鲁迅“甚至在左联初期，也还是作为革命的同路人”，公然同毛主席对鲁迅的高度评价唱对台戏。
