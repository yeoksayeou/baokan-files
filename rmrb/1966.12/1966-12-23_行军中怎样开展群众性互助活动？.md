Dear Red Guards and revolutionary little generals! Chairman Mao teaches us: "We come from all parts of the country, united for a common revolutionary goal. ... Our cadres must care for every soldier. Everyone in the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other." Cadres love soldiers, soldiers respect cadres, comrades care for, love, and help each other. This is the fine tradition of the People's Liberation Army. They live together, study together, and fight together for a common revolutionary goal, with deep proletarian feelings and comradeship. This fine tradition of unity and love is particularly evident during marches.

To carry out mutual aid activities well during marches, the most important thing is to strengthen education on unity and love. We must study Chairman Mao's teachings to make everyone understand that the relationship between class brothers is closer than any other relationship. Unity is strength. Only by sticking together can we overcome all difficulties and complete the tasks assigned by the Party and the people.

Mutual aid during marches includes both ideological and physical aid. The two are inseparable. However, ideological aid is the most important. This is because, during a march, each soldier's equipment is basically the same, especially during a long march, everyone is very tired. This makes it particularly necessary to strengthen ideological mutual aid among comrades. Everyone should care for and encourage each other spiritually, arouse high political enthusiasm and revolutionary heroism, and strengthen the confidence and courage to overcome difficulties. This is a reliable guarantee for all officers and soldiers to work together and complete the marching tasks.

Revolutionary little generals have probably all read the excellent novel "The Song of Ouyang Hai." Let's see how the great communist warrior Ouyang Hai cares for and helps his comrades during a march!

Once, Ouyang Hai's platoon received an urgent task. The troops immediately set out in the pouring rain, facing lightning and thunder. After several days of forced march, the soldiers were already very tired. Ouyang Hai, who was marching with a illness, was finding it increasingly difficult. At this moment, an order came from above to rest in place and await further orders. Ouyang Hai had not even sat down when he was busy checking on the situation of all his comrades. Due to marching in the rain, some comrades' backpacks were completely soaked, and the weight of their luggage had doubled. Many comrades had become "soaked soldiers." The new soldier Wei Wuyue in the class had blisters all over his feet. Ouyang Hai walked over and said, "Tough, huh, little Wei?" Little Wei quickly hid his feet and said, "I'm fine. I've been in the army for over a year, and I feel this march is the easiest, the most comfortable." Ouyang Hai was moved by this ordinary act of Little Wei and quietly walked over, took Little Wei's rice bag, and put it on his own shoulder. As a class leader, it felt good to reduce the burden for his comrades by a few pounds. Seeing that many comrades in the class had blisters on their feet, he also told them stories of the Long March. He said: During the Long March, the Red Army ate wild vegetables and grass roots, and even leather straps, and still won victories! Which old Red Army soldier didn't have blisters on his feet? But they stepped on the blisters and still completed the 25,000-li Long March. Ouyang Hai thus not only helped the soldiers physically but also ideologically. This is a prominent example of combining ideological and physical mutual aid.

The 7th Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army did an excellent job in mutual aid during their march into North Korea. While doing a good job in ideological mutual aid, they also organized physical mutual aid very well. In the 4th platoon of this company, a soldier named Pan Junshan fell ill during the march. Four comrades in the platoon divided Pan Junshan's belongings, unpacked the backpacks, and some put clothes in their own backpacks. Other comrades, according to their strength, carried weapons, ammunition, and fried noodles on their own. Pan Junshan was very moved and insisted on keeping up, not falling behind. This method quickly spread to other platoons. During the march, the entire company had no casualties and no one fell behind.

To carry out mutual aid activities well during marches, the company party branch must have a detailed understanding of the ideological and physical conditions of all personnel and be well-organized. Generally, it is organized by platoon and squad, with specific tasks assigned to those who need ideological and physical mutual aid, ensuring that no one falls behind in the platoon or squad. Now, many units have widely carried out "one helps one" and "one pair of red" activities during marches, pairing soldiers voluntarily to care for, love, and help each other ideologically and physically, ensuring the smooth completion of marching tasks.

In mutual aid activities, it is very important for cadres and party members to set an example and take the lead. Exemplary actions are powerful political work. Many company cadres and party members walk and talk with soldiers, help soldiers carry guns and backpacks. When encountering rivers, they go down first, and when encountering dangerous roads, they lead the way. These practical actions are a great encouragement to every soldier. Once, a company had to cross more than thirty li of river gullies, and the gravel hurt the soldiers' feet. A new soldier fell behind the team. The deputy political instructor of this company saw this, quickly caught up, took his backpack, held his arm, and talked with him. This new soldier greatly increased his confidence to overcome difficulties, took the backpack from the deputy political instructor, and quickly caught up with the team.

### 行军中怎样开展群众性互助活动？

    行军中怎样开展群众性互助活动？
    亲爱的红卫兵战士们，亲爱的革命小将们！毛主席教导我们说：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”干部爱护战士，战士尊敬干部，同志之间互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助，这是解放军的优良传统。他们为了一个共同的革命目标，生活在一起，学习在一起，战斗在一起，有着深厚的无产阶级感情和战斗友谊。这种团结友爱的优良作风，在行军中也表现得非常突出。
    要搞好行军中的团结互助活动，最重要的是加强团结友爱的思想教育。要学习毛主席的有关教导，使大家认识到阶级兄弟的关系比任何关系都要亲，团结就是力量，只有紧紧地团结在一起，才能战胜一切艰难困苦，完成党和人民交给的任务。
    行军中的团结互助，包括思想互助和体力互助。两者是分不开的。但是，最重要的还是思想互助。这是因为，在行军中，每个战士的装备大体上是相同的，尤其是长途行军，大家都很疲劳。这就特别需要加强同志间的思想互助，大家在精神上互相关怀，互相鼓励，激发起高度的政治热忱和革命英雄主义精神，增强克服困难的信心和勇气。这是使全体指战员同心同德，努力完成行军任务的可靠保障。
    革命小将们大概都看过优秀的长篇小说《欧阳海之歌》。请看，伟大的共产主义战士欧阳海，在行军中是怎样关心和帮助同志的吧！
    有一次，欧阳海所在的连队，接受了一项紧急任务，部队立即顶着暴雨，迎着闪电，踏着滚滚的雷声出发了。经过几天的急行军，战士们已经很疲劳了。带病坚持行军的欧阳海，更是一步比一步艰难。这时，突然传来上级指示，部队原地休息待命。欧阳海屁股还没沾地，就忙着了解全班同志的情况。由于冒雨行军，有的同志背包完全湿透了，行装的重量增加了一倍，更多的同志成了“泡”兵。班里的新战士魏武跃，双脚打满了血泡。欧阳海走过去说：“小魏，够呛吧！”小魏连忙藏起自己的双脚说：“我没啥，参军一年多，我觉得最轻松、最最轻松的行军就数这一次。你还是多关心点同志们吧！”欧阳海被小魏这极其平凡的表现所感动，不声不响地走过去，把小魏的米袋子抓过来扛在自己的肩上。能为战友们减轻一两负担，作为班长，心里也是舒坦的。看到班里不少同志脚上打了泡，他还给大家讲了红军长征的故事。他说：红军过草地的时候，吃的是野菜、草根，甚至吃皮带，还照样打胜仗！老红军战士，哪个脚上没有血泡？可是他们踩着血泡，照样走完了两万五千里。欧阳海就这样不仅在体力上帮助战士，更在思想上帮助战士。这是思想互助和体力互助相结合的一个突出的例子。
    中国人民志愿军某部七连，在入朝作战时，行军中的团结互助工作搞得很出色。他们在搞好思想互助的同时，体力互助也组织得很好。这个连的四班，在行军路上，有一个叫潘俊山的战士生病了。班里有四个同志就把潘俊山的东西分开，背包拆散，有的把衣服打在自己的背包里，其他同志根据体力强弱的情况，分别把武器、弹药、炒面背在自己身上。潘俊山很受感动，一路上咬牙坚持，一步也没有掉队。这个办法，很快就在其他班传播开来。行军途中，全连无一减员，无一掉队。
    要搞好行军中的互助活动，连队党支部对全连人员的思想情况和体力情况必须进行细致的了解，做到心中有数，并且做好组织工作。一般是以班排为单位，对需要在思想上和体力上互助的同志，实行分工包干，做到班不出班，排不出排。现在，许多部队在行军中都广泛开展“一帮一”、“一对红”活动，使战士在自觉自愿的基础上结成对子，在思想上和体力上互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助，保证行军任务的圆满完成。
    干部和党团员在互助活动中，处处以身作则，起模范带头作用，是很重要的。模范行动是有力的政治工作。许多连队干部和党团员，边走边和战士谈心，帮助战士扛枪背背包。遇到过河自己先下水，遇到险路自己走在前面，这些实际行动对每一个战士都是很大的鼓励。一个连队，有一次要通过三十多里的河沟，碎石硌得战士们脚底痛。有个新战士慢慢掉到队伍后边了。这个连的副指导员看到后，连忙赶上去接过他的背包，挽着他的胳膊边走边和他谈心。这个新战士大大增强了克服困难的信心，接过副指导员身上的背包，迅速赶上了部队。
