On December 5, I was settling the food accounts for a group of Red Guards on their Long March when four Red Guards entered, each carrying a stick of poplar wood.

One of the Red Guards said to me, "We need to borrow these four sticks. Could you calculate the cost?" I thought, these four sticks of poplar wood aren't worth much, and they are being too meticulous. So, I told them, "No charge. These sticks are for burning firewood. If you need them, take them."

They replied, "No, comrade! We appreciate your kindness, but we are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers, the reserve army of the PLA. We cannot violate the three main rules of discipline and eight points for attention!"

Just then, another Red Guard came in to settle his food account. After finishing the calculation, I looked around and saw that the four Red Guards had left. I thought they had understood, so I started tidying up the items on the table. Suddenly, I noticed a small paper package under the abacus. On the outside, it read "Beijing No. 6 Middle School Red Flag Long March Team." I quickly opened it to find money inside, with the following two lines written on the paper: "To the responsible comrade of the Pingxingguan Reception Station: We passed through here and needed four sticks. We have left the money for the sticks. Please collect it."

Oh, they had left the money after all. I hurried out to find them, but they had already left.

This incident, though small, carries significant meaning. Our Red Guards are indeed like the PLA, not taking a single needle or thread from the people, truly achieving the principle of not taking a single straw!

    像解放军一样秋毫无犯
    十二月五日，我正给一队长征红卫兵结算伙食账，外面来了四个红卫兵，每人手里拿着一根杨木棍。
    一个红卫兵对我说：“我们想用一下这四根棍子，请你算一算多少钱！”我想，这四根杨木棍还算什么钱，他们也太认真了，便对他们说：“不要钱，这些木棍是准备烧火用的，你们如果需要，就拿去吧。”他们说：“不行啊，同志！感谢你的好意，可是我们是毛主席的红小兵，是解放军的后备军，不能违犯三大纪律八项注意啊！”这时，又进来一个红卫兵找我结算伙食账。算完账，我向四周一看，四个红卫兵都走了。我以为把他们说通了，便整理桌面上的东西，忽然发现算盘下面压着一个小纸包，外面有“北京六中红旗长征队”字样。我赶忙打开一看，里边包着钱，纸上写着这样两行字：“平型关接待站负责同志：我们路过此地需用木棍四根，现留下木棍钱，请查收。”
    哎呀，原来他们又把钱留下了。我赶忙出去找，可是他们已经走了。
    这件事情虽小，但意义却挺深。我们的红卫兵，不是正像解放军那样，不拿群众的一针一线，做到秋毫无犯吗！
