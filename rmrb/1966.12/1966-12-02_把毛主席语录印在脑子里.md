	Memorize Chairman Mao's Quotations
	Soldier Huo Yunchun

	In the past, our class would study Chairman Mao's works in large sections, but I would forget them soon after reading. Therefore, my work did not align much with Chairman Mao's teachings, and I had a lot of blind spots.

	Once, while guarding the courtyard, I was in charge of the squad. During breakfast, someone told me, "There are people on duty, you can go eat." I heard that and left. The leader found out and criticized me, but I still felt I was in the right. Later, with the help of comrades, I studied a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations: "All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army must never relax their fighting spirit. Any thought of relaxing the fighting spirit or underestimating the enemy is wrong." Only then did I realize that I had made a mistake in this matter.

	After experiencing the sweetness of studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," I began to memorize some of Chairman Mao's quotations based on my own thoughts and work tasks. While carrying rice, I firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of picking the heavier burdens, and I did the "three picks": picking the far ones to carry, the muddy and wet ones to carry, and the large bundles to carry. Once, I carried more than ten bundles and fell into a ditch while crossing a small stream, getting splashed with muddy water. At that moment, my thoughts wavered, and I thought, "The company regulations say each person should carry eight to ten bundles, why do I have to carry so many?" Thinking this, I was about to put down a few bundles. But as soon as I untied the rope, I remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Work is struggle," "Resolutely fight, be prepared for sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." I was greatly encouraged and carried all the bundles, reciting Chairman Mao's words as I walked, finally reaching the courtyard.

	I realized that to make all my actions conscious, I must first memorize Chairman Mao's instructions. This is the prerequisite for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works effectively.

### 把毛主席语录印在脑子里

    把毛主席语录印在脑子里
    战士　霍云春
    以前班里成篇成段地学习毛主席著作，读过不久我就忘记了。因此，我干工作同毛主席的教导不大沾边，盲目性挺大。
    有一次看场院，我带班。吃早饭时，有人对我说，有值班的就行了，你可以吃饭去。我一听，就走了。领导发觉后批评我，我还觉得自己满有道理。后来在同志的帮助下，我学习了毛主席的一段语录：“人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”我才明白这件事是自己做错了。
    尝到了学习《毛主席语录》的甜头以后，我就结合自己的思想情况和劳动任务，背了一些毛主席语录。在背运稻子时，我牢记毛主席拣重担子挑的教导，作到了“三拣”：拣远的背，拣有泥的湿的背，拣大捆的背。有一次我背了十多捆，过一条水沟，一步没迈过去，掉到了沟底，溅了一身泥水。这时我思想上有些动摇，想起连里规定每人每次背八至十捆，我何必背这么多？想到这里，就准备拿下几捆。但刚一解绳，想起了毛主席的教导：“工作就是斗争”、“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，我得到了很大鼓舞，就全部背起来了，一面走，一面背毛主席的话，终于背到了场里。
    我体会到：要使自己的一切行动都变为自觉的行动，就必须首先把毛主席的指示印在脑子里。这是把毛主席著作学好用活的前提。
