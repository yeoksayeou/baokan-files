	Thought Must Never Go Astray
	Xú Hónggé

	Every time I started driving the cart, accidents would happen. Either the horse would bolt, or the cart would overturn. In one month, several accidents occurred. What was the problem?

	Initially, I thought it was a technical issue, blaming myself for not wielding the whip accurately enough to control the horse. I thought: to prevent accidents, I must wield the whip accurately. If I master this basic skill and control the horse, there won't be any accidents. I practiced whipping for several days, and my accuracy improved. But the next day, while driving, I hadn't gone far before I injured my own leg. I was puzzled: in terms of technique, my harnessing and whipping skills are not bad; in terms of the animals, these horses are no worse than those in other units. Why do others not have accidents, but I do? I thought and thought, but I couldn't figure out the reason. So, I went to the political instructor to hand over the whip and requested to be reassigned as a soldier.

	The political instructor listened to my words and kindly said, "Little Xu, I think the accidents are not due to the whip or the technique, but to your thoughts. To prevent vehicle accidents, you must first prevent accidents in your thoughts." Hearing the political instructor's words, I reflected on my thoughts since I started driving the cart. Indeed, the accidents were due to my thoughts. Although my body was driving the cart, my mind was on cars, always thinking about becoming a driver, and not treating the job of driving the cart as serving the people. My thoughts went astray, so the cart naturally went astray. A few days ago, during an emergency drive, a car passed by me, and I saw the driver in the cabin. My mind started wandering. As a result, I forgot to whip the horse and forgot to check the load, letting the cart roam freely on the bumpy road. When we reached the camp, I found that three pairs of boots and a ladle were missing. Was this a technical issue? This was purely because my thoughts had wandered. Only then did I realize: to never overturn or have accidents on the revolutionary path, thoughts must never go astray.

	With the help of my comrades, I repeatedly studied articles like "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People." Every time I read the sentence, "Our army is an army for the people. It is an army that is thoroughly for the people's interests," I would have a struggle in my mind. After a struggle, I realized: a revolutionary soldier cannot always be calculating for personal gain but must always think of the entire proletarian revolutionary cause. Once I understood this, my revolutionary enthusiasm surged. I decided to take heroes as my example, learning their spirit of not seeking fame or gain, not fearing hardship or death, and wholeheartedly serving the people and the revolution. I will whip and drive carts for the revolution all my life.

	With stable thoughts, the cart was driven steadily. With Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding light, the path ahead became straight, and there were no more detours. The cart I drive not only does not overturn on smooth roads but also travels quickly and steadily on high mountains and steep cliffs.

    思想千万不能出辙
    徐洪阁
    我开始赶大车总是发生事故。不是惊马，就是翻车。一个月发生了几次事故。这是啥问题呢？
    起初，我认为是技术问题，怪自己鞭子打得不准，降不住马。我想：要防止事故就得打准鞭子，只要把这个基本功练好，降住马，就不会出事故。我就苦练甩鞭子，经过几天练习，鞭子打得准了。谁知第二天出车，没走多远，就把自己的腿撞伤了。我心里纳闷：论技术，咱套车、甩鞭子都不赖；论牲口，这几匹马并不比其它连的差。为啥别人不出事故，我老出事故？想来想去，想不通这个道理。于是我去找指导员交鞭子，要求下班当战士。
    指导员听完我的话，亲切地对我说：“小徐呀，我看事故不是出在鞭子上，不是出在技术上，而是出在思想上。要防止车辆事故，得首先在思想上防事故。”听了指导员的话，我联想到自己赶车以来的思想情况。是呀！事故是出在思想上。我虽然身子在赶着大车，心里却想着汽车，一个心眼想当驾驶员，没有把赶大车这工作，看成是为人民服务。思想出了辙，大车当然要出辙。几天前的一次急行车就是一个例子：一辆汽车从我身旁开过，看到了驾驶室里的司机，我脑子就活动开了。结果，鞭子忘了甩了，拉的东西也忘了看了，任凭大车在坎坷不平的道路上自由行走。到营地一看，丢了三双大头鞋，一把锅铲。这那是技术问题，这不纯粹是思想溜了号引起的吗？这时我才觉察到：要想在革命的大道上永不翻车，不出事故，思想就千万不能出辙。
    在同志们的帮助下，我反复学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章。每当我读到“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”这一句话的时候，脑子里总要斗争一番。经过一番思想斗争，我认识到：一个革命战士不能老打个人的小算盘，而是要经常想到整个的无产阶级革命事业。想通了这个道理，革命干劲就来了。我决心以英雄为榜样，学习他们不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为人民，一心为革命的共产主义思想，为革命甩一辈子鞭子，赶一辈子车。
    思想稳定了，大车就赶得稳了。有毛泽东思想这个指路明灯，前进的道路也直了，不再出岔了。我赶的这辆大车，不仅在平坦的大道上不再翻车，就是在高山峻岭上，也走得又快又稳。
