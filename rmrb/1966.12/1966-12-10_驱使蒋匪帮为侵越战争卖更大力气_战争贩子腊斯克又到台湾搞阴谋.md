As a large number of American aggressor planes once again continuously bombed Hanoi and Haiphong, escalating the war, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk arrived in Taiwan from the afternoon of the 7th to the morning of the 9th to engage in conspiratorial activities.

According to a report from the United Press International on the 7th from Taipei, Rusk's visit to Taiwan aimed to have the Chiang bandits "play a greater role" in the Vietnam War. Chiang's clique members also loudly advocated for "thorough coordination" between the U.S. and Chiang, and said that if the U.S. and the South Vietnamese puppet regime requested Chiang's troops, Chiang's clique would be "willing to accept" and so on.

After arriving in Taiwan, Rusk immediately held secret talks with Chiang's "Minister of Defense" Chiang Ching-kuo, "Minister of Economic Affairs" Li Kuo-ting, and "Minister of Foreign Affairs" Wei Tao-ming, listening to reports on Taiwan's military, economic, and political situations, and "exchanging views." He also discussed "Far Eastern issues and related Sino-American issues" with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and the fake Vice President Yen Chia-kan, and did "explanatory work" on the U.S.'s conspiracy to create "two Chinas" in the United Nations General Assembly.

    驱使蒋匪帮为侵越战争卖更大力气
    战争贩子腊斯克又到台湾搞阴谋
    据新华社九日讯　正当大批美国强盗飞机再次连续轰炸河内和海防市，进行新的战争“升级”的时候，美国国务卿腊斯克又于七日下午至九日上午到台湾进行阴谋活动。
    据合众国际社七日发自台北的消息透露，腊斯克这次到台湾的目的是要蒋匪帮在越南战争中“发挥更大的作用”。蒋帮分子也在报刊上大肆鼓吹美、蒋“要彻底协调”，并且说什么如果美国和南越傀儡方面要求蒋帮出兵的话，蒋帮将会“乐于接受”等等。
    腊斯克到台湾后，立即同蒋帮“国防部长”蒋经国、“经济部长”李国鼎、“外交部长”魏道明等密谈，听取关于台湾军事、经济、政治情况的“报告”，“交换意见”。还与卖国贼蒋介石和伪副总统严家淦等就“远东问题以及中美有关问题”进行商谈，对美国在联合国大会制造“两个中国”的阴谋，作了“解释工作”等。
