Soldier Li Shengtian mends a shoe for a Red Guard, using the opportunity to educate the young revolutionary on traditional revolutionary values.

One day, a Red Guard accidentally tore his shoe while riding a bus. He decided to mend it himself. He borrowed some needle and thread and clumsily began to sew. In his haste, he pricked his hand with the needle.

Li Shengtian, a soldier from the "Xie Chen Class," saw this and felt a pang in his heart. He immediately went over to the Red Guard, took the needle and thread, and began to mend the shoe. His stitches were so skillful and swift. The Red Guard felt a bit embarrassed, blaming himself for not having the habit of mending and sewing. Li Shengtian thought, "I should not only mend his shoe but also use this opportunity to educate our young revolutionary comrades on traditional revolutionary values."

Li Shengtian noticed the Red Guard carefully examining his embroidered needle case with the words "Revolutionary Spirit Passed Down." He began to tell the story of the needle case:

"Early this year, veteran soldier Chen Qikui completed his service and went to the border to participate in construction. Before leaving, he kindly advised me to inherit and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of martyr Xie Chen, serving the people wholeheartedly. That night, he made this needle case for me under the lamplight and carefully embroidered these words. He also told me, 'I learned this from the model soldier Xie Chen. Comrade Xie Chen had a 'treasure bag' and a needle case. With these, he saved the country a lot of money and cultivated his own frugal and noble qualities. I hope you will inherit and carry forward this glorious revolutionary tradition.'

"Since then, this needle case has never left my side. I have used it to mend my own and my comrades' clothes and blankets, and to repair state-owned saddles..."

Li Shengtian, excited, continued, "Mending and sewing is a glorious revolutionary tradition. The needle case is a symbol of this tradition. In the past, the Red Army led by Chairman Mao carried it, overcoming countless difficulties and maintaining the character of the people's army. The 'Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road' carried it, resisting the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie. Now, we will carry it to build socialism. In the future, we will carry it to build communism. We are the descendants of revolution, the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, inherit and carry forward this glorious tradition of hard work and frugality, and pass it on to future generations."

Soon, the shoe was mended. The Red Guard, moved, said to Li Shengtian, "Comrade! I used to think that mending and sewing were trivial matters, whether I learned them or not didn't matter. Now I realize that this is a wrong thought. I will definitely take the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army back and let the revolutionary spirit flourish."

The next day, this Red Guard indeed went to the street and bought a needle case.

    战士李胜田替一个红卫兵补鞋时，用他自己的亲身体会，向小将进行了革命传统教育
    一针一线传作风
    一天，一个红卫兵在乘公共汽车的时候，不小心把鞋挂破了。他决定自己动手缝补。于是借来了针线，笨手笨脚地缝起来，一个不小心，针把手扎了。
    解放军派来的队长、“谢臣班”的战士李胜田看在眼里，疼在心上。他立刻走到那个红卫兵身边，接过针线缝起来。他缝的是那样灵巧，那样熟练。红卫兵看了有点过意不去，责怪自己过去没有养成缝缝补补的习惯，不会做针线活。李胜田心想，我不但应该替他补好鞋子，而且应该通过这件事，对我们的革命小将进行一次革命传统的教育。于是他就耐心地对那个红卫兵说：我入伍的时候，也不会缝缝补补，是老战士一针一线教给我的。
    李胜田看见红卫兵正在仔细地端详着自己的那个绣着“革命作风代代传”的针线包，他就讲开了这个针线包的故事：
    “今年年初，老战士陈其奎服役期满，到边疆参加建设去了。临行前，他亲切地叮嘱我，一定要继承和发扬谢臣烈士的革命精神，全心全意地为人民服务。晚上，他又在灯光下给我做了这个针线包，并且精心地绣上了这几个大字。他还对我说：我是向爱民模范谢臣学来的。谢臣同志有个‘万宝囊’和一个针线包，他用这个‘万宝囊’和针线包，为国家节约了大量财富，培养了自己艰苦朴素的优良作风和高贵品质。希望你一定要继承和发扬这种光荣的革命传统。
    “从那个时候起，这个针线包就没有离开过我。我用它缝补过自己和同志们的衣被，修补过国家的鞍具……。”
    李胜田讲到这里，兴奋地说：“缝缝补补是革命的光荣传统，针线包是体现这种传统的传家宝。过去毛主席领导的工农红军带着它，克服了重重困难，保持了人民军队的本色。‘南京路上好八连’带着它，顶住了资产阶级糖衣炮弹的袭击。现在，我们要带着它建设社会主义。将来，还要带着它建设共产主义哩。我们是革命的后代，是无产阶级革命事业的接班人，一定要听毛主席的话，把艰苦朴素的光荣传统接过来，传下去，发扬光大。”
    不一会，鞋子缝好了，那个红卫兵激动地对李胜田说：“队长！过去我总认为缝缝补补是小事，学不学没有什么，现在才知道这是错误的思想。我一定要把解放军的光荣传统带回去，让革命精神大发扬。”
    第二天，这个红卫兵果真跑到街上，买了一个针线包。
