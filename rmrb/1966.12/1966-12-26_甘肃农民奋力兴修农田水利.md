The winter agricultural infrastructure construction movement in rural areas of Gansu Province has reached a high tide, with over 2.6 million laborers participating, accounting for more than half of the province's rural labor force. According to incomplete statistics, in the past two months, the province has completed 275,000 mu of level terraces, 380,000 mu of ridged fields, 20,000 mu of new sand fields, and leveled over 1 million mu of farmland. Additionally, 7,000 large and small canals have been constructed, 1,000 wells have been dug, and a number of waterwheel pump stations and water hammer pump stations have been built.

This year, Gansu experienced more autumn rain, leading to a delayed harvest and increased planting of winter wheat and other crops compared to previous years. Consequently, winter construction in various regions was delayed by about half a month to twenty days. However, the achievements so far have surpassed those of the same period in previous years. This is because, through the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the awareness of the broad masses of commune members has been raised, and the revolutionary spirit to transform the world has been ignited.

The water conservancy projects, terraces, and ridged fields completed in various regions are of relatively high quality. (Xinhua News Agency)

    甘肃农民奋力兴修农田水利
    甘肃省农村冬季农田基本建设的群众运动已经达到了高潮，全省投入的劳动力已达二百六十多万，占全省农村劳动力的一半以上。据不完全的统计，过去两个多月中，全省已经修成水平梯田二十七万五千多亩，条田三十八万多亩，新铺砂田二万多亩，平整耕地一百多万亩，修成大小渠道七千多条，打井一千多眼，还建成了一批水轮泵站和水锤泵站。
    今年甘肃秋雨较多，秋收完成得迟，播种越冬小麦等作物也比往年多，因而各地的冬修一般比往年推迟了半个月到二十天左右。但是现在取得的成绩却超过了往年同期，这是因为在活学活用毛主席著作的运动中，提高了广大社员群众的觉悟，唤起了人们改天换地的革命激情。
    各地已修成的水利工程、梯田、条田等，质量都比较好。（据新华社讯）
