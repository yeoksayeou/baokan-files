Title: They Listen Most to Chairman Mao's Words

The "Red East" Long March team from Henan Agricultural College passed through our commune. The nine members arrived with dirt still on their hair, dropped their backpacks, and the first thing they did was read Chairman Mao's quotations and propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the masses. After eating, they did not rest but instead held up red flags to visit the commune-run enterprises and conduct investigations among the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The next morning, the commune cadres saw that their room door was closed and thought they were still resting from their journey. Little did they know, at dawn, they had already gone to the "Yugong Team" to help level the land. Upon arriving at the "Yugong Team," they first performed cultural programs at the field's edge for the community members, propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and then labored alongside the community members. During breaks, they distributed Mao's quotations, which they had printed themselves, and taught the community members songs based on Mao's quotations.

What moved us the most was that these nine Red Guards labored all day. When it got dark, they saw community members fetching firewood two miles away and rushed to help, pushing carts until it was pitch black and had delivered firewood to every household. That night, they came to find me, asking me to talk about the village's history and the situation of production struggles. They said, "We are Chairman Mao's Red Guards and resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, humbly learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants."

On the day they left, the commune's kitchen staff prepared to make them breakfast as soon as it was light, but they did not want to trouble others and had already made their own breakfast before dawn.

They are all very young students, but after reading Chairman Mao's books, each one is so diligent and caring towards the people, truly like soldiers of the Red Army.

Their revolutionary actions deeply moved us, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Everyone unanimously expressed that they too must learn from them, study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, wholeheartedly farm for the revolution, and with the spirit of Yugong moving mountains, build our new socialist countryside.

    他们最听毛主席的话
    河南农学院“东方红”长征队，路过我们公社。他们九个人一到，头发上还都是土，放下背包第一件事，就是读毛主席语录，向群众宣传毛泽东思想。他们吃罢饭也不休息，就举着红旗去参观社办企业，并向贫下中农作调查。
    第二天一早，公社的同志见他们住的房门关着，以为他们赶路累了，还在休息。那知道，天蒙蒙亮他们就到“愚公队”参加平整土地去了。他们一到“愚公队”，先在地头为社员演出文艺节目，宣传毛泽东思想，接着就跟社员一道劳动。休息时，就向社员散发他们刻印的毛主席语录，还教社员们学唱毛主席语录歌。
    最感动我们的是，这九个红卫兵劳动了一整天，天都黑了，见社员们在两里路外搬柴禾，也赶忙推着车子去帮忙，直到天漆漆黑，给每户社员送完了为止。晚上，他们又来找我，要我讲村史，谈生产斗争情况。他们说：“我们是毛主席的红卫兵，坚决要听毛主席的话，虚心向贫下中农学习。”
    他们走的那天，公社炊事员同志准备天一亮就给他们做饭，可是他们不愿麻烦别人，天没亮，自己就把饭做好了。
    他们都是年纪很轻的学生，可是读了毛主席的书，一个个都那么勤勤恳恳，那么关心人民群众，真像个红军的样子。
    他们的这些革命行动，使我们广大贫下中农很感动。大家一致表示，也要像他们那样，更努力地学习毛主席著作，全心全意为革命种田，用愚公移山的精神，建设我们社会主义的新农村。
