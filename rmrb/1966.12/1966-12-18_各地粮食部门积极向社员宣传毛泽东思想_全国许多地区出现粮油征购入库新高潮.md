	Grain departments across the country are actively promoting Mao Zedong Thought to the members. A new wave of grain and oil procurement has emerged in many regions nationwide.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 17th, grain department workers across the country are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," actively promoting Mao Zedong Thought to the broad masses of community members, and speeding up the procurement of grain and oil. Many regions have seen a new high tide in grain and oil procurement. By mid-December, the national grain procurement plan had already been completed by more than 90%. Shandong and Sichuan provinces have already completed their annual plans ahead of schedule.

	In the past month and a half, grain department workers across the country have further studied Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's instructions on seizing the revolution and promoting production. Through study, everyone has further realized that doing a good job in grain and oil procurement is of great significance to the development of the entire national economy and the arrangement of production, construction, and people's lives for next year. We must seize the opportunity and race against time to procure grain and oil according to state policies and complete and overfulfill the procurement tasks as quickly as possible. To ensure that the Cultural Revolution and procurement work are not neglected, many regions have further established two sets of leadership teams, with the Cultural Revolution as the guideline, seizing the revolution, promoting production, and strengthening leadership over the Cultural Revolution and grain and oil procurement work.

	In the process of speeding up grain and oil procurement, various places first focus on promoting Mao Zedong Thought to advance the thought revolution of the people. The Wannian County in Jiangxi Province organized a team of over 300 people to promote Mao Zedong Thought to the countryside. They printed over 40,000 copies of Chairman Mao's quotations on grain issues and distributed them to each household, conducting detailed propaganda and explanations to the community members. The grain department of Yuxian County in Shanxi Province organized a team of over 60 people to go deep into the communities and study Chairman Mao's "Old Three Articles" with the masses, widely propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the community members. In just a few days, over 10,000 people received education in Mao Zedong Thought.

	Due to the strengthened promotion of Mao Zedong Thought by grain departments in many regions and the widespread movement of studying Chairman Mao's works, especially the "Old Three Articles," in rural areas, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of community members has significantly improved, and their patriotic enthusiasm has soared. Many regions' community members have proposed to learn from the revolutionary spirit of Zhang Side and Norman Bethune, to break down "self" and establish "public," and to sell the best grain to the state. Some regions have proposed to achieve five things to remember in a bumper harvest: not to forget the world's revolutionary people, not to forget the socialist construction of the country, not to forget the development of collective economy, not to forget disaster prevention and preparedness, and not to forget thrift. Community members have expressed their determination to select the best grain to sell to the state. The Dezhou Prefecture in Shandong Province, which has suffered from frequent disasters in the past, has overcome drought and pest disasters with the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong this year and achieved an agricultural bumper harvest. The broad masses of community members said that this year's bumper harvest is completely the result of everyone following Chairman Mao's words and fighting against nature. Drinking water should not forget the well-digger; we should sell the surplus grain to the state as soon as possible to express our gratitude to Chairman Mao's heartfelt intentions. This prefecture's grain delivery this year is almost equal to the total delivery amount of 1964 and 1965.

	While doing a good job in procurement, various grain departments also, in accordance with the principle of balancing the interests of the state, collective, and individuals, timely help production teams to distribute grain well, properly arrange the lives of the masses, and do a good job in grain reserves for communities.

    各地粮食部门积极向社员宣传毛泽东思想
    全国许多地区出现粮油征购入库新高潮
    据新华社十七日讯　全国各地粮食部门广大职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，积极向广大社员宣传毛泽东思想，加紧进行粮食和油料的收购工作，许多地区出现了新的粮油征购入库高潮。到十二月中旬，全国粮食征购计划已经完成百分之九十以上。山东、四川两省已经提前完成了全年计划。
    近半个多月来，各地粮食部门职工进一步学习了毛主席、党中央关于抓革命、促生产的指示。通过学习，大家进一步认识到，做好粮油收购工作，对于整个国民经济的发展以及明年的生产建设和人民生活的安排都有重大意义，必须抓紧时机，争分夺秒，按照国家政策，把粮食和食油收购起来，尽快地完成和超额完成收购任务。为了保证做到文化大革命和收购工作两不误，许多地区进一步健全了两套班子，以文化大革命为纲，抓革命，促生产，加强了对文化大革命和粮油征购工作的领导。
    各地在抓紧粮油收购工作中，首先注意抓好毛泽东思想的宣传，促进人的思想革命化。江西省万年县组织了三百多人的毛泽东思想宣传队下乡，他们把毛主席关于粮食问题的语录印了四万多张，分发给每户社员，向社员进行详细的宣传讲解。山西榆次县粮食局组成六十多人的宣传队，深入社队同群众一道学习毛主席的“老三篇”，向社员群众广泛进行宣传，几天之内，就有一万多人受到毛泽东思想的教育。
    由于不少地区粮食部门加强了毛泽东思想的宣传，由于广大农村掀起了学习毛主席著作、特别是学习“老三篇”的群众运动，广大社员的社会主义觉悟显著提高，爱国主义热情更加高涨。许多地区的社员提出要学习张思德、白求恩的革命精神，破“私”立“公”，把最好的粮食卖给国家。有的地区提出要做到丰收五不忘：不忘世界人民革命，不忘国家社会主义建设，不忘发展集体经济，不忘抗灾备荒，不忘勤俭节约。社员们纷纷表示，一定要挑选上等粮卖给国家。历年来灾害较多的山东省德州专区，今年以愚公移山的精神战胜了旱灾、虫害，夺取了农业丰收。广大社员说，今年的丰收，完全是大家听毛主席的话，战天斗地，干出来的。喝水不能忘记打井人，我们要早点把余粮卖给国家，表表我们感谢毛主席的一片心意。这个专区今年一年交售的粮食，差不多等于一九六四、一九六五两年交售数量的总和。
    各地粮食部门在做好征购工作的同时，还按照国家、集体、个人三者利益兼顾的原则，及时帮助生产队搞好粮食分配，妥善安排群众生活，搞好社队的粮食储备工作。
