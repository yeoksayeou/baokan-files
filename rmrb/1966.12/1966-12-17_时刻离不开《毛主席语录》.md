One morning, a veteran soldier from a certain regiment's First Company, Liang Yaopan, put on his new military uniform and set off on his journey home. He thought about seeing his family, whom he had not seen in four years, the next day, and his steps were quick.

Liang Yaopan arrived at the Baiwei Pier. The sun was already high. He looked at the undulating sea surface, with fishing boats dotting the waves, and the approaching ship still far away. He thought: Not even a moment of time should be wasted. He wiped the sweat from his face and, out of habit, reached into his bag to get the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," but it was not there. He searched his entire body but still could not find it. He clearly remembered: Last night, he had specially put the "Quotations" into his bag, but why were they not there now?

Liang Yaopan, a Communist Party member who had been rated as an outstanding soldier for three consecutive years, had developed a good habit. No matter when or where, he always carried Chairman Mao's book with him and studied it whenever he had time. In early March of this year, when he was alone in a mountain valley carrying out production tasks, the "Quotations" were never far from him. While resting from hoeing, he would read a passage; while resting from carrying manure, he would also read a passage. At this moment, he could not find Chairman Mao's book, how could he not be anxious?

He thought and thought, and finally remembered: This morning, before leaving the company, he had taken the "Quotations" out of his bag and read the passages about serving the people, feeling that he should do more good things for the company before leaving for more than ten days. At that time, it was almost dawn, and he hurriedly closed the "Quotations," picked up the water bucket, and by the moonlight, watered the more than one mu of vegetables for the entire platoon. After returning, he looked at the time and saw that there was only about an hour left before the ship departed, so he hurriedly set off. In the rush, he forgot to bring the "Quotations."

Suddenly, a long whistle from a steamboat interrupted Liang Yaopan's thoughts. He looked up and saw that the ship was about to reach the pier. The passengers were all packing their luggage, ready to board. What to do? Board the ship without Chairman Mao's book? Go back to get it? It would take more than twenty miles round trip, and there would not be enough time. If he missed the ship, he would not be able to see his long-separated family the next day, and the time to reunite with his family would be reduced by a day. Go back or not? Liang Yaopan heard the voices of heroes and models ringing in his ears. Lei Feng said: Chairman Mao's works are like "food," "weapons," and "steering wheels." Liu Yingjun said: Chairman Mao's works are an indispensable source of endless power and wisdom in my life. Liao Qijiang said: Mao Zedong Thought is the basis for being a person, the soul of life, the source of strength, the guide for action, the weapon for struggle, and the fundamental principle of revolution. He thought: Studying Mao Zedong Thought is the first need in the life of every revolutionary soldier. One can go a day without food, a day without sleep, and one can not visit home. When visiting home, one can leave without anything, but one cannot leave without Chairman Mao's book, and one cannot not read it! Thinking of this, he resolutely left the pier and returned to the company.

The next morning, after getting up, the first thing Liang Yaopan did was to carefully put the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in his chest pocket, pressing it tightly against his heart. When setting off, he touched it several times before he could finally set off on his journey home with peace of mind.

    时刻离不开《毛主席语录》
    一天清晨，某部一连老战士梁耀潘穿上崭新的军装，踏上了探家的路途。他想到明天就可以看见阔别四年的亲人了，步子迈得很快。
    梁耀潘来到了白荇码头，太阳已经一竿多高了。他望着波浪起伏的海面，渔帆点点，驶过来的轮船还在远方。心想：这点滴的时间也不能放过。他擦去脸上的汗珠，习惯地伸手到挂包里摸《毛主席语录》，可是没有摸到。他又搜遍了全身也没有找到。他清楚地记得：昨晚已经特意地把“语录”装进挂包里，可现在怎么不见了呢？
    梁耀潘，这个连续三年评为五好战士的共产党员，他已经养成了一种良好的习惯。不管什么时候，不管走到那里，他都把毛主席的书带在身上，有空就学起来。今年三月初，他单独住在山沟里执行生产任务的时候，“语录”也从不离身。锄地休息时，他读一段；挑粪歇担时，他也读一段。这时候，他找不到毛主席的书，怎么能不焦急呢？
    他想了又想，终于想起来了：在今早离开连队之前，他从挂包里把“语录”拿出来，读了有关为人民服务的论述，心里就觉得：自己要离开连队十多天，应该为连队多做点好事。这时天快亮了，他急忙合上“语录”，拿起水瓢，借着月光，把全排一亩多菜地都浇上了水。回来后看看时间，离开船只有一个多钟头了，赶紧出发。匆忙之间，《毛主席语录》却忘记带上。
    突然，一声汽笛的长鸣，打断了梁耀潘的思索。他抬头一看，轮船快开到码头了。乘客们都在收拾行李，准备上船。怎么办呢？上船吧，身边没有带上毛主席的书；回去拿吧，来回得走二十多里路，时间来不及了。搭不上船，明天就看不到久别的亲人，和亲人团聚的时间就少一天。回不回去？梁耀潘耳边响起了英雄模范响亮的声音。雷锋说：毛主席著作好比“粮食”、“武器”、“方向盘”。刘英俊说：毛主席著作是我生活中不可缺少的一种无穷的力量和智慧。廖初江说：毛泽东思想是做人的依据，生命的灵魂，力量的源泉，行动的指针，战斗的武器，革命的根本。他想：学习毛泽东思想是我们每个革命战士生活中的第一需要。饭可以一天不吃，觉可以一天不睡，家可以不探。探家时，什么东西都可以不带，毛主席的书可不能不带，不能不读！想到这里，他便毅然地离开码头，返回连队。
    第二天早晨，梁耀潘起床后头一件事，就是小心翼翼地把《毛主席语录》放在胸前的口袋里，紧紧地贴在心上。出发时，他还再三地摸了摸，才放心地重新踏上探家的路途。
