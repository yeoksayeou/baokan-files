Chairman Mao's handwritten "Picking Quarrels and Making Trouble" and Guo Moruo

	The small globe, a few flies bump into the wall. Buzzing, a few screams, a few sobs. Ants climbing the locust tree boast of a great country, a cicada trying to shake a tree, how easy is that? Just as the west wind blows and the leaves fall in Chang'an, the whistling arrows fly.

	So many things, always urgent; the heavens and earth turn, time presses. Ten thousand years is too long, we strive for every moment. The four seas churn with angry clouds and water, the five continents shake with thunderous winds. We must sweep away all pests, and there will be no enemies.

    毛主席手书《满江红》和郭沫若
    小小寰球，有几个苍蝇碰壁。嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣。蚂蚁缘槐夸大国，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。正西风落叶下长安，飞鸣镝。　　多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌。（附图片）
