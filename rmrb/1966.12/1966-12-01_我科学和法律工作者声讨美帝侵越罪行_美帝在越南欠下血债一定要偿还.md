A group of Chinese scientists and legal professionals held a meeting today to strongly condemn the heinous war crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in its aggression against Vietnam. They pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the most vicious and brutal war criminal in the contemporary world, and strongly condemned the modern revisionists, with the Soviet Communist Party leadership as their center, for shamefully acting as accomplices to U.S. imperialism.

The scientists and legal professionals, in their speeches, pointed out that the statement issued by the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's Commission to Investigate U.S. Imperialism's War Crimes in Vietnam on October 31, and the black book "It Is More Brutal Than Hitler" recently published by the Vietnam South National Liberation Front's Commission to Indict U.S. Imperialism and Its Puppets' War Crimes in South Vietnam, further exposed the war crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in Vietnam. These documents fully express the profound hatred of the entire Vietnamese people towards U.S. imperialism and their resolute will to drive U.S. imperialism out of Vietnam. They emphasized that the blood debt owed by the U.S. in Vietnam must be repaid in blood.

The speakers expressed: Chinese scientists and legal professionals, together with the people of the entire nation, will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, and resolutely stand as a strong rear guard for the Vietnamese people, fully supporting our Vietnamese brothers to carry the anti-U.S. national salvation war to final victory.

Deputy Head of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front's Permanent Representative Office in China, Nguyen Minh Vuong, was invited to attend the meeting.

Deputy Head Nguyen Minh Vuong was invited to speak at the meeting. He said, U.S. imperialism is an enemy that the Vietnamese people will never forget. The people of South Vietnam are determined to carry the anti-U.S. national salvation struggle to the end. The combat unity and friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China will be further strengthened and consolidated in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism. Scientists from the fields of physics, medicine, agriculture, and law, among others, numbering in the dozens, attended today's meeting.
