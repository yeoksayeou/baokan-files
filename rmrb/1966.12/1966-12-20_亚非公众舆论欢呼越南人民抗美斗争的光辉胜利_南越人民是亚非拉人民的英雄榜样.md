On the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, David Sibeko, the chief representative in Dar es Salaam of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa), issued a statement saying: "The glorious struggle of the South Vietnamese people under the correct leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is one of the greatest contributions in the long struggle against the greatest enemy of mankind—imperialism."

He said that the people of Azania will steadfastly support the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in its just struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and for the unification of the motherland.

The chief representative in Dar es Salaam of the Zimbabwe African National Union, Chikuta, also issued a statement pointing out: "Those who are against the Vietnamese people are also against us on the African continent. We fully support the Vietnamese people's war to drive out imperialism and its lackeys from Vietnam."

The representative in Dar es Salaam of the South West Africa People's Organization, Kanju, in his statement strongly demanded that U.S. imperialism and all its puppet armies withdraw unconditionally from Vietnam. He said that the future of South Vietnam can only be decided by the South Vietnamese people. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the sole representative of the South Vietnamese people.

According to Xinhua News Agency, London, December 17, on the eve of the sixth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (December 20), some progressive African organizations here and the Britain-Vietnam Solidarity Committee enthusiastically praised the brilliant victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their struggle against the United States for national salvation.

The representative in London of the Basutoland Congress Party, Morapo, pointed out that the Vietnamese people have set a heroic example for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their revolutionary struggle against imperialism.

He called on all the people of the world to condemn and oppose the U.S. "peace" deception. He said that this deception is coordinated with the "gradual escalation" of military aggression.

Ahmed Gora Ibrahim, the assistant representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa), said that the heroic Vietnamese people have dealt a fatal blow to U.S. imperialism both on the battlefield and in the political arena. He said that U.S. imperialism has never been as desperate and isolated as it is now.

The chairman of the African People's Organization Committee in London, Egara, said: "We, the African People's Organization Committee, believe that the United States is not only an aggressor in Vietnam but also an aggressor in the entire Asian, African, and Latin American regions. It is our right and duty to fight against it and drive it back."

The spokesman for the Britain-Vietnam Solidarity Committee, Manchanda, said: The brilliant victories won by the Vietnamese people in the war of liberation prove the brilliant thesis of Chairman Mao that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, December 18, the Permanent Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Asian-African Lawyers' Conference issued a statement in Conakry on December 16, expressing the warmest congratulations to the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam for its brilliant achievements in the struggle against U.S. imperialism, and condemning the continuous bombing of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, by U.S. bandit planes.

The statement said: "The Permanent Secretariat expresses great indignation at the continued dirty war of aggression by the United States in Vietnam and the large-scale bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by the U.S. Air Force, and strongly protests against this blatant violation of the Geneva Agreements and international legal norms."

The statement emphasized that the so-called "peace efforts" of the United States are aimed at deceiving world public opinion in order to implement the conspiracy to intensify the war. The statement pointed out: "In particular, the recent events of continued U.S. troop buildup in South Vietnam and the bombing of Hanoi provide evidence of this." The statement called on all lawyers in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world to urgently demand that the United States immediately stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, withdraw U.S. and puppet troops from South Vietnam, and respect the right of the Vietnamese people to settle their own affairs.

    新华社达累斯萨拉姆十九日电　在越南南方民族解放阵线成立六周年的时候，阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会驻达累斯萨拉姆首席代表戴维·西贝科发表声明说：“南越人民在越南南方民族解放阵线正确领导下进行的光荣斗争，是在长期的反对人类最大的敌人——帝国主义的斗争中，作出的最伟大的贡献之一。”
    他说，阿扎尼亚人民将坚持不渝地支持越南南方民族解放阵线反对美帝国主义侵略和争取祖国统一的正义斗争。
    津巴布韦非洲民族联盟驻达累斯萨拉姆首席代表契胡塔也发表声明指出：“反对越南人民的那些人，也就是反对我们非洲大陆的那些人。我们完全支持越南人民为把帝国主义及其走狗赶出越南所进行的战争。”
    西南非洲民族联盟驻达累斯萨拉姆代表坎朱在声明中强烈要求美帝国主义和它的一切仆从军队无条件地滚出越南。他说，越南南方的前途只能由越南南方人民来决定。越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民的唯一代表。
    据新华社伦敦十七日电　在越南南方民族解放阵线成立六周年（十二月二十日）前夕，这里一些进步的非洲人组织和英国—越南团结阵线热烈赞扬越南人民在抗美救国斗争中取得的光辉的胜利。
    巴苏陀兰大会党驻伦敦代表莫拉波指出，越南人民给亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义的革命斗争树立了英雄的榜样。
    他要求全世界人民谴责和反对美国的“和谈”骗局。他说，这个骗局是同军事侵略行动的“逐步升级”相配合的。
    阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会的助理代表艾哈迈德·戈拉·易卜拉欣说，英雄的越南人民“在战场上和政治上都给了美帝国主义以致命的打击。美帝国主义有史以来还没有像现在这样走投无路，这样孤立。”
    伦敦的非洲人组织委员会主席埃加路说：“我们非洲人组织委员会认为，美国不仅在越南是侵略者，在整个亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲地区也是侵略者。同它作斗争并且打退它，这是我们的权利和义务。”
    英国—越南团结阵线发言人曼钱达说：越南人民在解放战争中赢得的光辉胜利，证明了毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的光辉论断。
    新华社科纳克里十八日电　亚非法律工作者会议执行委员会常设书记处十六日在科纳克里发表声明，最热烈地祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线在反对美帝国主义的斗争中所取得的辉煌成就，谴责美国强盗飞机连续轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内。
    声明说：“常设书记处对美国继续进行侵略越南的肮脏战争和美国空军大规模轰炸越南民主共和国，表示极大的愤怒，并且对这种明目张胆破坏日内瓦协议和国际法准则的行径提出严正抗议。”
    声明强调指出，美国的所谓“和平努力”是为了欺骗世界舆论从而实现加紧战争的阴谋。声明指出：“特别是最近美国在南越继续增兵和轰炸河内的事件，提供了这方面的证明。”声明呼吁亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲以及全世界所有法律工作者紧急要求美国立即停止轰炸越南民主共和国，从越南南方撤走美国及其走狗的军队，尊重越南人民自己解决自己事务的权利。
