The Air Force's Four Company in a certain unit in Shanghai has launched a campaign of red family letters during the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. All the officers and soldiers in the company consciously quote Chairman Mao's sayings when writing to their families, using Chairman Mao's words to educate their family members. This effectively spreads Mao Zedong Thought, educates their relatives, and promotes the officers' and soldiers' ideological transformation.

The red family letters campaign in this company began in February this year. Soldier Zhu Jinchang, after enlisting, often received letters from his wife complaining about difficulties. Zhu Jinchang initially only sent her some money and said a few kind words, but the problems were not resolved. Later, he thought that his wife, being a daughter of a poor peasant, would surely listen to Chairman Mao's words. He wrote more than ten letters addressing his wife's ideological issues, quoting Chairman Mao's sayings on serving the people. Mao's words worked wonders. With Zhu Jinchang's help, his wife diligently studied the "Three Articles" (Serve the People, In Memory of Norman Bethune, and The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains), and her thoughts underwent a significant change. She always thought of the collective and the community members, often did good deeds for the production team and community members, and actively participated in labor. She also wrote several letters to Zhu Jinchang, expressing her determination to put "public" first and eliminate "private," striving to become an outstanding community member. Soon, she joined the Communist Youth League and was elected as an outstanding community member and a county-level activist in studying Chairman Mao's works.

After Zhu Jinchang's experience of writing red family letters to educate his wife became known in the company, the company's party branch and higher-level leadership paid great attention to it. They believed this was a new way to spread Mao Zedong Thought and promote the revolutionary transformation of the officers' and soldiers' families, helping to establish a new comradely relationship between officers, soldiers, and their family members. The company's party branch immediately helped Zhu Jinchang summarize his experience in writing red family letters, widely publicized it throughout the company, and organized a red family letters exhibition, establishing a red family letters mailbox. Thus, the red family letters campaign quickly spread throughout the company. In a few months, the company had written over 640 red family letters. These letters, like propaganda leaflets for Mao Zedong Thought, were sent to remote villages, mountainous areas, and islands, effectively educating the officers' and soldiers' family members and helping them quickly raise their consciousness. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings to prioritize the public over the private and the collective over the individual, correctly handling various issues.

During the socialist education movement and the Cultural Revolution, many officers and soldiers in this company actively used Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle to write letters educating their relatives, helping them distinguish class lines and stand firmly on the proletarian side in the great waves of class struggle.

Through writing red family letters, the officers and soldiers in Four Company educated their relatives; the transformation and progress of their relatives, in turn, motivated the officers and soldiers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently, and to grasp their own ideological transformation. Now, many officers and soldiers in this company are engaged in revolutionary competitions with their wives, parents, and brothers, creating a lively revolutionary scene where soldiers help their relatives, and relatives inspire the soldiers.

    用毛主席语录教育家属
    空军某部四连开展红色家信活动
    据新华社上海二十日电　驻上海空军某部四连在活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动中，广泛开展红色家信活动。全连干部、战士在写家信的时候，自觉地引用毛主席语录，用毛主席的话教育家属，既有效地传播了毛泽东思想，教育了亲人，也促进了干部、战士的思想革命化。
    这个连队的红色家信活动，是从今年二月开始的。战士朱金章入伍后，他的爱人经常来信摆困难。朱金章开始只是给她寄点钱，多说几句好话，但是问题并没有解决。后来他想到爱人是贫农的女儿，一定能听毛主席的话，就针对爱人的思想问题，引用毛主席关于为人民服务的语录，先后写了十多封家信，教育爱人。毛主席的话一用就灵。在朱金章的帮助下，他爱人努力学习“老三篇”，思想有了很大的转变，一心想着集体，想着社员，经常为生产队和社员做好事，积极参加劳动。她还多次写信向朱金章表示，要“公”字当头，挖掉“私”字，决心争当五好社员。不久，她就入了团，被评上了五好社员和县的学习毛主席著作积极分子。
    朱金章写红色家信教育爱人的事迹在连队传出以后，连队党支部和部队的上级领导机关都极为重视，认为这是传播毛泽东思想的新事物，也是促进干部、战士家庭革命化，使干部战士和家庭成员之间建立崭新同志关系的一条好路子。连队党支部立即帮助朱金章总结了写红色家信的经验，在全连广泛宣传，并组织了红色家信展览，建立了红色家信信箱。这样，红色家信活动便在全连迅速地开展起来。几个月来，这个连队已经写红色家信六百四十多封。这一封封红色家信，就像一张张宣传毛泽东思想的传单，送到偏僻的乡村、山区和海岛，有效地教育了干部、战士的家属，促使他们迅速提高觉悟，按照毛主席的教导，做到先公后私，先集体后个人，正确地处理了各种问题。
    在社会主义教育运动和无产阶级文化大革命中，这个连队的许多干部、战士还积极地用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，写信教育亲人，帮助他们在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，划清阶级界限，站稳无产阶级立场。
    四连的干部、战士通过写红色家信，教育了亲人；亲人的转变和进步，又推动了干部、战士更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓自己的思想革命化。现在这个连有不少指战员在和妻子、父母、兄弟之间进行革命竞赛，出现了战士帮亲人，亲人促战士的热气腾腾的革命景象。
