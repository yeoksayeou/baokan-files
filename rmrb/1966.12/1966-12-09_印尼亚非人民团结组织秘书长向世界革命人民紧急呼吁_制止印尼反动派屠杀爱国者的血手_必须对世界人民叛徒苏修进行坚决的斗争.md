Chairman Mao said: “The rampant activities of all internal and external dark forces have caused national disasters; but this rampancy not only shows that these dark forces still have strength, but also shows that they are in their last struggle, indicating that the people are gradually approaching victory.”

New China News Agency, December 8th: The Secretary-General of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization of Indonesia, Iprasin Isha, recently issued a statement urgently appealing to the revolutionary comrades, progressive individuals, and democrats in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the entire world to stop the bloodshed of 300,000 Indonesian patriots by Suharto and Nasution, and to strongly protest and condemn the heinous crimes of the Indonesian reactionary authorities in massacring the Indonesian people.

The statement said that the Indonesian people and the 300,000 patriots who are currently facing the danger of being annihilated by the butchers Suharto and Nasution in the most barbaric ways are in a desperate situation and hope to receive the support of revolutionary people and progressive individuals from all over the world.

The statement pointed out that the fascist regime of Suharto and Nasution, under the instigation of American imperialism, has cruelly and on a large scale killed tens of thousands of democrats, progressives, and communists across Indonesia in the past year, creating a white terror and stifling the Indonesian national liberation movement. Today, in Indonesia, wolves are rampant, and all democratic rights have been trampled upon.

The statement strongly condemned the ongoing large-scale massacre of the Indonesian people by the Indonesian reactionary authorities. The statement said that currently, in the prisons and concentration camps of the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime, there are more than 300,000 of Indonesia's finest sons and daughters, many of whom are workers, peasants, youth, university students, women, scientists, journalists, writers, and cultural workers, and are leading members and cadres of revolutionary organizations. They are living in inhuman conditions under the most inhumane treatment. Due to torture and lack of food and medicine, many of them are sick. The bloody Suharto-Nasution fascist regime is killing our brothers by shooting them and letting them die from torture, disease, and starvation.

The statement said that Indonesian revolutionaries are reorganizing. They are determined to unite all possible forces, combine with the peasant revolution, and use armed struggle to overthrow the Suharto and Nasution fascist regime. We believe that the Indonesian revolutionaries will ultimately win.

The statement said that in the struggle, we are relying on our own strength. At the same time, we also need and value sincere support and help. For this reason, we appeal to you, the liberation comrades and democrats of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the entire world, to stand up like one person to oppose the evil plot of Suharto and Nasution to further massacre 300,000 Indonesian patriots.

The statement said that we understand that sincere support and help can only come from true friends. We have no illusions about the Soviet modern revisionists and their followers. The Soviet revisionist leadership has become a traitor to the liberation cause of the Indonesian people, the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the people of the entire world, including the Soviet people. When the Indonesian people are in their most difficult times, the Soviet modern revisionists and their followers not only continue to supply military equipment to the Suharto and Nasution fascist regime to kill our people but also happily invite the Indonesian fascist regime's Foreign Minister Adam Malik to visit the Soviet Union; however, they expelled the Indonesian "People's Daily" reporter Anwar Darma from Moscow. This shameful traitorous behavior is intolerable. We Indonesian revolutionaries will resolutely fight against the modern revisionism centered on the CPSU leadership, which has done much to sabotage the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world.

    印尼亚非人民团结组织秘书长向世界革命人民紧急呼吁
    制止印尼反动派屠杀爱国者的血手
    必须对世界人民叛徒苏修进行坚决的斗争
    毛主席说：“一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，造成了民族的灾难；但是这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。”
    新华社八日讯　印度尼西亚亚非人民团结组织秘书长依普拉欣·依萨最近发表声明，紧急呼吁亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲以及全世界的解放战友、进步人士和民主人士，阻止苏哈托和纳苏蒂安进一步大规模屠杀三十万印度尼西亚爱国者的血手，最强烈抗议和谴责印度尼西亚反动当局大规模屠杀印度尼西亚人民的滔天罪行。
    声明说，印度尼西亚人民和目前面临着遭到苏哈托和纳苏蒂安刽子手用最野蛮的办法来灭绝的危险而处在危急的处境中的三十万爱国者，期望得到全世界革命人民和进步人士的声援。
    声明指出，苏哈托和纳苏蒂安的法西斯政权，在美帝国主义的怂恿下，过去一年中，在印度尼西亚全国范围内，残酷地大规模地杀害了几十万民主人士、进步人士和共产党人，造成白色恐怖，扼杀印度尼西亚民族解放运动。在今天的印度尼西亚，豺狼当道，一切民主权利都被践踏了。
    声明强烈谴责印度尼西亚反动当局正在进行的大规模屠杀印度尼西亚人民的滔天罪行。声明说，目前，在苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权的监狱和集中营里的三十多万印度尼西亚最优秀的儿女，他们中间有很多人是工人、农民、青年、大学生、妇女、科学家、新闻工作者、作家和文化工作者等革命团体的领导成员和干部。他们在最不人道的待遇下，过着非人的生活。由于虐待和缺乏食物和药品，他们中间有许多人患病。血腥的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权正在用枪毙的办法和让他们由于酷刑受伤、疾病和饥饿而死的办法来杀害我们的兄弟。
    声明说，印度尼西亚革命者正在重新组织起来。他们决心团结一切可以团结的力量，同农民革命相结合，用人民武装斗争来推翻苏哈托和纳苏蒂安法西斯政权。我们相信，印度尼西亚革命者将夺得最后胜利。
    声明说，在斗争中，我们正在依靠自己的力量。同时我们也需要和重视真诚的声援和帮助。为此，我们向你们，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界的解放战友们和民主人士们呼吁，像一个人一样地起来反对苏哈托和纳苏蒂安进一步屠杀三十万印度尼西亚爱国者的罪恶阴谋。
    声明说，我们懂得，真诚的声援和支持也只能来自真正的朋友。我们对于苏联现代修正主义者及其追随者完全不抱任何幻想。苏联修正主义领导集团已成为印度尼西亚人民、亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民，以及全世界人民，包括苏联人民的解放事业的叛徒。当印度尼西亚人民处在最困难的时刻，苏联现代修正主义者及其追随者不仅继续把军事装备输送给苏哈托和纳苏蒂安法西斯政权用来屠杀我国人民，并欣然邀请印度尼西亚法西斯政权的外交部长阿达姆·马利克访问苏联；但是，他们却把印度尼西亚《人民日报》记者安哇尔·达尔玛从莫斯科驱逐出境。这种可耻的叛徒行为是不能令人容忍的。我们印度尼西亚革命者，要同对全世界人民的革命斗争干了许多破坏活动的、以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义进行坚决的斗争。
