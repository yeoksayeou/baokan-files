This story took place on the morning of October 10th of this year.

That night, after the autumn rain had passed, the sky was dark and the mist was thick. At the guard post on the south end of the Qian Tang River Bridge, there was a sturdy soldier on duty. His round, childlike face had a few traces of youthfulness, but he was fully armed, and his sharp eyes carefully watched the situation around the bridge. He stood tall and proud, like a seasoned veteran. He was Comrade Cai Yongxiang.

Comrade Cai Yongxiang was born into a poor, bitter family in Feidong County, Anhui Province. In February, he had just turned eighteen, and with a deep hatred for the class enemy and a strong desire to defend the motherland, he joined the People's Liberation Army of China. He loved Chairman Mao the most. In elementary school, he loved to read the textbook "The East Is Red" and loved to sing the song "The East Is Red." To see Chairman Mao every day, he secretly wore his brother's Chairman Mao badge on his chest. After enlisting, the first time he received his allowance, he bought three books of Chairman Mao's works and studied the "Three Articles" diligently, using "completely," "thoroughly," and "two extremes" as his yardstick to constantly transform his thoughts, doing whatever Chairman Mao instructed. After arriving at his unit, he was assigned to guard the bridge. He always worked diligently and conscientiously, even remembering the exact times when different vehicles passed each day. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he declared to the Party branch, "With guns in hand, we will protect this Cultural Revolution and guard the bridge." He clearly knew that "imperialism and domestic reactionaries will not accept their defeat and will make their last struggle." The Qian Tang River Bridge is a crucial transportation link between the south and north of the motherland, connecting the southeast of the country with the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—Beijing, serving as a bond for the revolutionary link-up. Although he had volunteered to help the commune carry manure all day and was very tired, his spirit was highly concentrated once he was on duty. The first two cargo trains, loaded with construction materials, passed safely. He knew the next train was the 764th direct to Beijing, a special train for the Red Guards, and habitually looked towards the south end of the bridge. The fog was too thick, and he could only vaguely see a few dozen meters ahead. At that moment, a train whistle and the sound of wheels came from the distance: "Woo—clack, clack..." From about a hundred meters away from the south end of the bridge, a beam of light appeared, followed by the locomotive coming into view. Some might ask: Was this the 764th direct to Beijing, the special train for the Red Guards? Yes, this train had left Nanchang more than a day ago. The Red Guard youths on board were overjoyed. Look, they were all spirited, chatting and singing, reciting Chairman Mao's quotations, singing, laughing, and the sounds blended together, never ending. Although it was already past two in the morning, they had no sleepiness at all and wished they could fly to Beijing to see our great leader Chairman Mao. Despite the train already running at a speed of sixty to seventy kilometers per hour, they still felt it was too slow. The driver seemed to understand the Red Guards' feelings and drove the train both fast and steady. As the train approached the bend, the driver controlled the speed to about sixty kilometers per hour, and the train quickly passed the bend about a hundred meters from the south end of the Qian Tang River Bridge. In just a few hundred meters, it would cross the bridge.

At this moment, Cai Yongxiang was also staring intently at the approaching train and, using the light from the locomotive, carefully examined the tracks ahead. Suddenly, he noticed a large piece of wood lying across the tracks about forty meters from the guard post. This unexpected situation made him tense, realizing the danger! If the obstacle was not removed immediately, the train would derail. What should he do?! Cai Yongxiang's mind flashed with a thought: "Charge forward!" Before he could finish the thought, he dashed out of the guard post, gun in his right hand, crouching low, like a tiger descending a mountain, following the tracks towards the oncoming train. "Stop the train, stop the train!" he shouted, his eyes fixed on the wood on the tracks. The train was getting closer, one hundred meters... ninety meters... At the same moment, the driver, using the light from the locomotive, saw someone charging forward and was startled: "Who is it?! This is too dangerous!" He immediately blew a long whistle, trying to warn the person to get out of the way. But Cai Yongxiang paid no attention to these warnings and continued to run forward, eighty meters... seventy meters... The driver saw that something was wrong ahead and immediately applied the emergency brake, pulling the brake lever hard. But the train, driven by its momentum, surged forward, sixty meters, fifty meters, thirty meters... Oh no! The train was only twenty meters away from Cai Yongxiang. Because the driver was too nervous, he now saw, under the light, the piece of wood on the tracks. What should he do? The driver was in a panic, gripping the emergency brake lever tightly. "Train, please stop! Time, please slow down!" But the train was running, time was flying, and Cai Yongxiang was running. Ten meters! Nine meters! Eight meters! What about the Red Guards on the train? What about this soldier? The driver's heart was pounding like fire. But Cai Yongxiang had already put his personal safety aside, his eyes wide open, charging towards the oncoming train like a sprinter. In that instant, he seemed to hear Chairman Mao's voice: "Cai Yongxiang! Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, working thoroughly for the people's interests." He seemed to see the tall figure of Ouyang Hai charging forward, using his shoulder to push the military horse out of the tracks, preventing a serious accident. Cai Yongxiang had only one thought: "A person should live like Norman Bethune, dedicating all his energy and life to the cause of human liberation. Even if the sky falls, he dares to support it, and in the face of life and death, he dares to charge! Today, the class enemy is causing sabotage, and I must not let the state's property be damaged, and I must not let the Red Guards' lives be threatened! I must remove the wood, protect the bridge, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" At this critical moment, Cai Yongxiang summoned all his strength, sped up, and with his gun in his right hand, rushed ahead of the locomotive. He leaned to the left, crouched down, and with a mighty effort, lifted the wood with his left hand and leaped to the right side of the tracks. At that moment, the train roared past and stopped safely on the bridge. But Cai Yongxiang had unfortunately been hit by the locomotive and fell to the ground. As soon as the train stopped, the driver and nearby comrades rushed over, tears in their eyes, and carried our Cai Yongxiang, shouting in unison, "Soldier of the Liberation Army! Cai Yongxiang!" But our Cai Yongxiang, who had sacrificed his life to protect the Qian Tang River Bridge and the Red Guards, to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great thought of Mao Zedong, had already died a heroic death!

Chairman Mao said: "Tens of thousands of martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests ahead of us. Let us hold high their banner and march forward, treading on their blood!" Cai Yongxiang's revolutionary spirit of loyalty to Chairman Mao and to Mao Zedong Thought will forever inspire us to march forward bravely under the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao!

    壮丽的青春
    荀永安
    这个故事发生在今年十月十日的凌晨。
    这天夜里，秋雨刚过，夜色昏黑，漫天大雾迷迷蒙蒙。在钱塘江大桥南端的守桥哨所里，有一个身材壮实的战士正在执勤。看他那圆虎虎的脸上虽然带有几分孩子气，但他全副武装，一双炯炯有神的大眼严密地注视着大桥周围的情况，雄赳赳气昂昂的，就像一个久经考验的老战士。他就是蔡永祥同志。
    蔡永祥同志出生在安徽省肥东县的一个苦大仇深的贫农家庭里。今年二月，他刚满十八岁，就怀着对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨，怀着保卫祖国的强烈愿望，参加了中国人民解放军。他最热爱毛主席，在小学里，就爱读《东方红》这课书，最爱唱《东方红》这首歌。为了天天能看到毛主席，还悄悄地把他哥哥的一枚毛主席像章挂在胸前。入伍后第一次领到津贴费，就买了三本毛主席著作，刻苦学习“老三篇”，以“完全”、“彻底”和两个“极端”为尺子，不断改造自己的思想，做到了只要是毛主席指示的，他就照着做。他到连队以后，担任守卫大桥的任务，工作总是勤勤恳恳，积极认真，就连每天什么时候过什么车，他都记得清清楚楚。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他还向党支部表示决心：“紧握手中枪，保卫好这场文化大革命，守好大桥。”他清楚地知道：“帝国主义和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”钱塘江大桥是祖国南北交通要道，它把祖国东南方和无产阶级文化大革命的中心——北京紧紧地联系在一起，是革命大串连的纽带。今天白天，虽然他主动帮助公社挑了一天的粪，已经很累了。可一上了哨，精神却非常集中。头两趟货车满载着建设物资都安全地通过了，他知道下一趟是764次直达北京的红卫兵专车，又习惯地朝大桥南端方向看了一眼。雾气太大，只能模模糊糊看到几十米远的地方。这时，远处传来一阵火车的汽笛声和车轮声：“呜——咔嚓，咔嚓……”只见从距离大桥南端一百多米远的弯道上透出了一缕亮光，紧接着，机车就出现在他的眼前。哎，有的同志也许要问了：是764次直达北京的红卫兵专车吗？对，这趟车从南昌开出已经一天多了。车上红卫兵小将们那股高兴劲儿就甭提了。你们看，他们一个个精神抖擞，又说又唱，朗读毛主席语录声，唱歌声，说笑声，此起彼伏，连绵不断。虽说现在已经是深夜两点多钟了，可他们一点儿睡意也没有，都恨不得一下子飞到北京，见到我们伟大领袖毛主席。尽管火车已经以每小时六、七十公里的速度向前飞跑着，可他们还嫌车子跑得太慢了。司机也好像早摸透了红卫兵小将们的心情一样，把车子开得既快又稳。当火车接近弯道时，司机把车速控制在每小时六十公里左右，列车很快地驶过了钱塘江大桥南端一百多米远的弯道，再有百把米就要过桥了。
    这时，蔡永祥同志也目不转睛地看着远处驶来的列车，并且借着车头的灯光仔细地察看了一下前面的轨道。突然，他发现在距离哨所四十米处的轨道上横放着一根大木头。这意外的情况，使他顿时变得紧张起来，危险！如果不马上排除，列车就有翻车的事故发生，怎么办？！蔡永祥脑子里飞快地闪过一个念头：“冲上去！”说时迟，那时快，他一个箭步“噔”！冲出了哨所，右手持枪，弓着腰，犹如猛虎下山一样，顺着铁轨，迎着飞奔而来的列车。“快停车，快停车！”他一边大喊着，一边两眼死死盯住轨道上的木头。火车越来越近，一百米……九十米……。也就在这同一时刻，司机借着车头的灯光发现有一个人冲上来了，心里猛的一惊：“谁？！这太危险了！”随即拉了一声长长的汽笛，想叫他快点闪开。可蔡永祥同志那顾这些，继续向前飞奔，八十米……距离火车只有七十米了。司机一看：“不对，前面一定发生情况了！”他立刻采取了紧急制动“咔”把制动闸一拉，可是火车被强大的惯力推得向前猛冲，六十米、五十米、三十米……啊呀！火车距离蔡永祥同志只有二十米了。由于刚才司机太紧张了，现在他借着灯光一看，才发现轨道上的那根木头。怎么办？司机急得死死扳住紧急制动闸。“火车，你快停下吧！时间啊！你走慢点吧！”可是，列车在飞跑，时间在飞跑，蔡永祥同志在飞跑。十米！九米！八米！车上的红卫兵怎么办？这位战士可怎么办？司机的心就像火烧一样。可蔡永祥同志早把个人安危丢在一边，圆瞪着双眼，就像运动员冲刺一般，迎着飞奔而来的列车猛冲向前！在这一刹那间，他耳边好像响起了毛主席的声音：“蔡永祥！我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”他仿佛又看到了欧阳海的高大身影冲上去了，用肩膀把军马扛出铁轨，避免了一场严重事故。蔡永祥只有一个想法：“一个人活着就应该像白求恩那样，把自己的精力和整个生命为人类的解放事业全部献出，天塌下来也敢顶，生死关头也能冲！今天阶级敌人搞破坏，我决不能让国家财产受到损失，决不能让红卫兵的生命受到威胁！一定要搬开木头，保住大桥，捍卫无产阶级文化大革命！”就在这千钧一发的时刻，蔡永祥用尽生平最大的力气加快了速度，右手持枪，赶在机车前头，身子往左一侧，一弯腰，“嘿！”奋力用左手抱起木头，向铁轨右侧跃去，这时，火车呼啸而过，安全地停在大桥上。但蔡永祥同志不幸已被机车撞倒在地上。车刚一停，司机和附近的同志纷纷奔跑过来，含着热泪抱起我们的蔡永祥同志，同声呼喊着：“解放军同志！”“蔡永祥同志！”而我们的蔡永祥同志，为了保卫钱塘江大桥和红卫兵，为了捍卫无产阶级文化大革命，捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想，已经壮烈地牺牲了！
    毛主席说：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”蔡永祥同志忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想的革命精神，将永远鼓舞着我们在伟大领袖毛主席的指引下奋勇前进！
