Chen An Tie, a Red Guard from Mao Zedong's hometown in Xiangtan, Hunan, once picked up one fen (one hundredth of a yuan) on the street while visiting the National Song and Dance Troupe. At that time, he did not pay much attention to this one fen. Upon returning to his lodging, a PLA soldier organized a study session on the "Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." After the study session, Chen An Tie immediately thought of the one fen he had picked up. He thought of how Red Guards should always follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and every word and deed should be selfless and dedicated to others. Isn't one fen one hundred times larger than one hao (one thousandth of a yuan)? With this in mind, he immediately turned in the one fen. He said, "What I turned in is not just one fen, but a heart that does not deviate from Chairman Mao's teachings by even the slightest bit."

    “分”和“毫”
    来自毛主席家乡——湖南韶山的红卫兵陈安铁，有一天，到民族歌舞团串连，在路上拾到一分钱。当时，他没有把这一分钱放在眼里。回到住地，解放军同志组织大家学习“三大纪律八项注意”、《纪念白求恩》。学习以后，陈安铁马上想到了拾到的那一分钱，想到红卫兵要时刻听毛主席的话，一言一行都要毫不利己、专门利人，这一分钱不比“毫”大一百倍吗？想到这里，他马上把一分钱交了公。他说：“我交的不是一分钱，而是丝毫不违背毛主席教导的心。”
