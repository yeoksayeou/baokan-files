	Everyone in Huzhu County, Qinghai Province, Duba People's Commune has organized over 160 study groups of Chairman Mao's works. Now, every village has a study organization, every team has active study members, and every household has a plaque with Chairman Mao's quotations. Everyone strives to be beneficial to the people.

	Old poor peasant Zhou Shouzhi lets his daughter read him a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations every night. If he doesn't understand it after one reading, he has her read it again until he does. Through study, his class consciousness has greatly improved. There is a thin horse in the team that is difficult to raise. He thought of Chairman Mao's teachings in the "Three Constantly Read Articles" about serving the people, so he brought the horse home to take care of it carefully. He said, "Others say I'm old and should be a five-guarantee household. I think: Chairman Mao is much older than me, and he still worries so much for the people of the whole country and the whole world. I am only in my sixties. As long as I live one more day, I will do one more day of revolution. Now, I finally understand that living is not for oneself, but for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution."

	Ruo Man Yun, a young intellectual from Shuangzhai Brigade, returned to the countryside to participate in production after graduating from junior high school. Some people said she was a "foolish girl" and that "engaging in agricultural work is a waste of her future." These cold words made her heart flutter. She took this question to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," two brilliant works, and was deeply moved by the communist spirit of selflessness and dedication to the people shown by Zhang Side and Norman Bethune. She decided to learn from them and become a person who is greatly beneficial to the people. From then on, she not only worked diligently in agricultural production but also actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought to those who had criticized her, helping them overcome their wrong thoughts.

    大家争做有利于人民的人
    青海省湟中县多巴公社已组织起来毛主席著作学习小组一百六十多个。现在，村村有学习组织，队队有学习积极分子，户户有毛主席语录牌，大家争做有利于人民的人。
    老贫农周守智，每天晚上都让他的女儿给他读一段毛主席语录，一遍不懂，再读一遍，直到学懂为止。通过学习，他的阶级觉悟大大提高。队里有一匹瘦骒马，不好饲养。他想到毛主席在“老三篇”中有关为人民服务的教导，就把马拉到自己家里来精心喂养。他说：“别人说我老了，应该当五保户了。我想：毛主席年纪比我大得多，还为全国人民、全世界人民操那么大的心。我才六十多岁，我只要活一天，就要干一天革命。现在，我才懂得活着不是为了自己，是为了中国革命和世界革命。”
    双寨大队知识青年罗曼云，初中毕业回乡参加生产，有人说她是个“傻姑娘”，“干农业活是白白糟踏了前途”。这些冷言冷语，把她的心说得七上八下。她带着这个问题，学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》两篇光辉著作，深深为张思德、白求恩毫不利己专门利人的共产主义精神所感动，决心向他们学习，使自己变为一个大有利于人民的人。从此，她不仅踏踏实实安心于农业生产，还积极向那些议论她的人，宣传毛泽东思想，帮助他们克服错误思想。
