Tokyo, Dec. 29 (New China News Agency) - Japanese figures from various circles today issued statements warmly hailing China's successful conduct of another nuclear test. They pointed out that this is another brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and this success has once again dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet modern revisionists' plot to monopolize nuclear weapons.

Well-known Japanese figure Nishizawa Ryuji said: The People's Republic of China has successfully conducted nuclear tests at an astonishing speed, which will surely make the U.S. imperialists and modern revisionists tremble with fear. He pointed out that the success of this new nuclear test is another new victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Secretary-General of the Japan Committee for Asian-African Solidarity Sakamoto Tokumatsu said, this new nuclear test was achieved under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao in the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which shows that China has achieved great successes in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. Sakamoto said, at a time when the U.S. imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists are colluding to carry out the "bombing and negotiation" plot against Vietnam, China's successful nuclear test is of great significance.

Vice-Chairman of the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) Ito Takeo said: China's new nuclear test is a major blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the followers of Soviet modern revisionism.

Central Executive Committee Chairman of the Japan Federation of Publishers and Booksellers Associations Kiyohashi Kunio said, at a time when the U.S. imperialists are trying to expand the war of aggression, China has raised the level of nuclear weapons technology to a new height, which will become a great force to stop the expansion of the war of aggression, and is also a great encouragement to the Japanese working class in their struggle for national independence.

Famous Japanese writer Emachi Shu said to a Chinese journalist that China's successful nuclear test "demonstrates the boundless might of Mao Zedong Thought," and it is also "a rich fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that is now being carried out in a magnificent way in China." He said, "I heartily hail long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

Kofu Shokichi, a member of the Executive Committee of the Japan-China Friendship Association Yamaguchi Prefecture Headquarters (orthodox) who has just returned from a visit to China, said: This victory shows that China's science and technology and national defense power are developing rapidly under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. It fully proves that once the great Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it becomes a tremendous material force and exerts boundless might. Kofu pointed out: This victory is a great aid from the Chinese people to the Japanese people who are struggling against U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Japanese reactionaries. It also powerfully encourages the Vietnamese people who are bravely fighting against U.S. imperialist aggression, and it powerfully encourages all the people of the world.

Secretary-General of the Japan Philatelic Association Mizuhara Akari said: China's successful conduct of another nuclear test shows that Mao Zedong Thought is the shining sun in the hearts of the people of the world, and it also shows that the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved success. He said, "This shows that the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought can create great achievements." Mizuhara said, "Only Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding star of our revolution."

    据新华社二十九日讯　东京消息：日本各界人士今天纷纷发表谈话，热烈欢呼中国又成功地进行了一次核爆炸。他们指出，这是毛泽东思想的又一辉煌胜利，这个成功又一次沉重地打击了美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义企图垄断核武器的阴谋。
    日本知名人士西泽隆二说：中华人民共和国以惊人的速度成功地进行核爆炸，必将使美帝国主义和现代修正主义吓得发抖。他指出，这次新的核爆炸的成功，是毛泽东思想的又一新胜利。
    亚非人民团结日本委员会理事长坂本德松说，这次新的核爆炸，是在由毛主席亲自领导的规模宏伟的无产阶级文化大革命中获得成功的，这说明，中国在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三方面都取得了伟大的硕果。坂本说，正在美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义相互勾结，对越南展开“以炸迫和”阴谋的时候，中国核爆炸的成功，是具有重大的意义的。
    日中友好协会（正统）总部副会长伊藤武雄说：中国的新的核爆炸，是对于美日反动派和苏联现代修正主义追随者的重大打击。
    日本出版工会协议会中央执行委员长楢桥国武说，正当美帝国主义企图扩大侵略战争时，中国把核武器的科学技术提高到一个新的水平，这将成为阻止侵略战争扩大的巨大力量，也是对争取民族独立的日本工人阶级的巨大鼓舞。
    日本著名作家江马修对中国记者说，中国核爆炸的成功“显示出毛泽东思想的无比威力”，同时“也是目前轰轰烈烈地开展着的中国无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果”。他说：“我衷心欢呼毛泽东思想万岁！”
    刚刚从中国访问归来的日中友好协会山口县总部（正统）理事长、全国常任理事古谷庄一郎说：这一胜利表明中国的科学技术和国防力量在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，更加飞快地发展着。它充分证明，伟大的毛泽东思想一旦被广大群众所掌握，就成为巨大的物质力量，发挥无限的威力。古谷指出：这一胜利是中国人民对正在同美帝国主义、现代修正主义和日本反动派进行着斗争的日本人民的巨大援助。它也有力地鼓舞了正在为反对美帝国主义侵略、不屈不挠地进行着英勇斗争的越南人民，有力地鼓舞了全世界人民。
    日本集邮协会理事长水原明窗说：中国又成功地进行了一次核爆炸表明，毛泽东思想是世界人民心中光辉灿烂的太阳，它也表明伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命已获得成功。他说：“这表明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是可以创造出伟大的业绩的。”水原说：“只有毛泽东思想是指导我们革命的指针。”
