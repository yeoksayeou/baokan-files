	Portuguese authorities in Macau have been forced to announce the full acceptance of our conditions. Our relevant parties and patriotic compatriots in Macau are closely monitoring the developments in Macau, warning the Portuguese authorities: they must immediately and completely fulfill our just demands, no delay is allowed, and no concessions can be made. If they continue to plot, they will face double punishment.

	Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: Under the indignant denunciation of the great people and Red Guards of the socialist motherland, and under the immense pressure of the unyielding struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Macau, the Portuguese authorities in Macau were forced to announce the acceptance of the four conditions proposed by the statement of the Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee, as well as the six demands put forward by the representatives of various circles in Macau.

	On the evening of December 12th, the Portuguese authorities in Macau announced on the radio that they "fully accept" the four conditions proposed in the statement of the Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee. On the evening of December 13th, the Portuguese authorities in Macau again announced on the radio that they "fully accept" the six demands proposed by the representatives of various circles in Macau and expressed their willingness to hand over their response to the representatives of various circles in Macau. Subsequently, the Macau authorities issued several proclamations in the name of the "Governor" Jaloop, announcing the dismissal of the main perpetrators in the bloody massacre of our compatriots in Macau: Army Commander Schven, Police Chief Fu Jili, Deputy Police Chief Yan Duanni, and Acting Director of the Island Administration Bureau Yan Deqi.

	At present, our relevant parties and the broad patriotic compatriots in Macau are closely monitoring the developments in Macau. They solemnly warn the Portuguese authorities in Macau: you must immediately and completely fulfill the four conditions proposed in the statement of the Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee and all the just demands of the compatriots in Macau. No delay is allowed, and no concessions can be made. If you say one thing and do another, plot in the dark and act in the light, and continue to play tricks, then you will be fully responsible for all the consequences and will face double punishment.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 20th: The Macau Women's Federation held a meeting last night, strongly condemning the brutal massacre of compatriots by the Portuguese authorities in Macau, and warning the Portuguese authorities that they must immediately and completely fulfill the four conditions proposed in the statement of the Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee and the six demands of the compatriots in Macau, and not allow any two-faced tactics.

	More than 300 women from Macau who participated in the meeting observed a moment of silence for the deceased compatriots and then read together Chairman Mao's quote: "We must not, because of our victories, relax our vigilance against the desperate plots of revenge by the imperialist elements and their running dogs. Whoever relaxes this vigilance will be disarmed politically and put himself in a passive position."

	The meeting was presided over by Zhang Qinghui, Chairwoman of the Macau Women's Federation. The women from Macau who participated in the meeting spoke one after another, pointing out that the Portuguese authorities must quickly fulfill our serious demands and absolutely not allow the Kuomintang's special agents to carry out sabotage activities in Macau. They expressed that they would not rest until they achieved complete victory. They enthusiastically shouted: "Long live the great unity of the compatriots in Macau!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live our most beloved Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live! Ten thousand years!" The meeting ended with the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and warm applause.

	The Macau Footwear Workers' Union also held an anti-persecution struggle meeting.

    新华社二十日讯　在伟大的社会主义祖国广大人民和红卫兵的愤怒声讨下，在澳门爱国同胞不屈不挠地坚持进行抗暴斗争的强大压力下，澳门葡萄牙当局被迫宣布接受我广东省人民委员会外事处处长声明中提出的四项条件，以及澳门各界同胞代表会议提出的六项要求。
    十二月十二日晚，澳葡当局在广播电台宣布，“全部接受”我广东省人民委员会外事处长声明中所提出的四项条件；十二月十三日晚，澳葡当局又在广播电台宣布，“全部接受”我澳门各界同胞代表会议提出的六项要求，并表示要向我澳门各界同胞代表面交其答复。此后，澳门当局又以“总督”嘉乐庇的名义发表了几项公告，宣布解除在血腥屠杀我澳门同胞事件中的主要肇事者陆军司令施维纳、警察厅长傅基利、警察厅副厅长颜端尼和代理海岛行政局长晏德地的职务。
    目前，我国有关方面和澳门广大爱国同胞，正密切地注视着澳门局势的发展。他们严正地警告澳门葡萄牙当局：你们必须立即全部地、彻底地实现我广东省人民委员会外事处长声明中提出的四项条件和澳门同胞提出的一切正义要求，绝对不容许拖延，不容许打半点折扣。如果你们说一套做一套，阴一套阳一套，继续玩弄阴谋，那末，你们就要对由此产生的一切后果负完全责任，并将受到加倍惩罚。

    参加大会的三百多名澳门妇女为死难同胞默哀后，齐声朗读毛主席语录：“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性，谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位。”
