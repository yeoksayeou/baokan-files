The Portuguese authorities in Macau recently brutally oppressed Chinese residents in the Taipa area, resulting in a severe incident where over forty Macau compatriots were severely beaten by armed police, leaving many injured.

Chinese residents in the Taipa area of Macau, in an effort to solve the problem of their children's education, raised funds to rent a building to convert into a school. On the 15th of this month, the Portuguese authorities in Macau obstructed the residents' efforts to repair the school and took extremely brutal measures. On one hand, they lured residents to send representatives for negotiations and then illegally detained them; on the other hand, under the command of the "First Deputy Commissioner of the Police Bureau" Preira, a large number of armed police carried out two large-scale beatings against unarmed residents, injuring over forty workers, farmers, teachers, nurses, elderly, women, and children on the spot. Among them, ten people were seriously injured, with some collapsing unconscious. At the same time, fourteen injured individuals and two reporters from the "Macau Daily" who were covering the event were also arrested. The residents who were illegally lured and detained were also "sentenced."

The fascist bloody atrocities committed by the Portuguese authorities have sparked great indignation among the Macau compatriots. The oppression of the Macau compatriots by Portuguese imperialism has been consistent, and this time it is a premeditated, planned large-scale bloody persecution. The Macau compatriots sent representatives to lodge a serious protest with the Portuguese authorities and put forward five demands: severely punish the culprits, not infringe upon the legitimate rights of the residents, compensate for all losses, revoke the unreasonable verdict against the detained representatives, and ensure that similar incidents of unreasonable beatings of residents do not occur in the future. The "Macau Daily" also lodged a serious protest against the Portuguese police. Despite the overwhelming evidence, the Portuguese authorities still maintain a unreasonable attitude. The Macau compatriots are extremely angry at the arrogant attitude of the Portuguese authorities.

In recent days, various strata, unions, associations, schools, and various sectors such as education, women, students, news, and commerce in Macau have held condemnation meetings. At various condemnation meetings, Macau compatriots united in their indignation, denouncing the heinous crimes committed by Portuguese imperialism against the Macau compatriots. They lodged a serious protest against the Portuguese authorities' deliberate persecution of Chinese people this time and firmly demanded that the Portuguese authorities immediately implement the five just demands put forward by the Macau compatriots. In particular, they demanded that the Portuguese authorities severely punish the instigator of this bloody atrocity, the "First Deputy Commissioner of the Police Bureau" Preira, and publicly apologize and make amends to the Macau compatriots.

The Macau compatriots solemnly pointed out that the nature of this bloody atrocity committed by the Portuguese authorities in Macau against Chinese people is extremely serious. The Portuguese authorities are fully responsible for this bloody atrocity and its consequences. We are closely monitoring the developments of this situation and the attitude of the Portuguese authorities.

    澳葡当局残暴迫害中国居民造成严重流血事件
    澳门同胞严重抗议葡萄牙当局法西斯暴行
    据新华社香港二十九日电　澳门葡萄牙当局最近残暴迫害澳门氹仔地区的中国居民，造成四十多名澳门同胞惨遭武装警察毒打受伤的严重流血事件。
    澳门氹仔地区的中国居民，为了解决子女入学问题，自筹经费租得房子想修作校舍。本月十五日，澳葡当局对居民修理校舍横加阻挠，并且采取了极其残暴的手段，一方面诱骗居民派代表前往谈判而将代表非法拘捕；另方面由“警察厅第一副厅长”颜端尼指挥大批武装警察对手无寸铁的居民进行两次大规模毒打，当场殴伤工人、农民、教师、护士、老人、妇女、儿童等四十多人。其中有十人伤势严重，有的昏迷倒地。同时，还逮捕了十四名受伤者和两名在场采访的《澳门日报》记者，还将被非法诱捕的居民代表“判罪”。
    澳葡当局这一法西斯血腥暴行，激起了澳门同胞极大的愤慨。葡萄牙帝国主义对澳门同胞的迫害是一贯的，这一次更是有预谋、有计划的血腥大迫害。澳门同胞派出代表向澳葡当局提出了严重抗议，并且提出五项要求：严惩凶手，不得侵犯居民正当权益，赔偿一切损失，撤销对被诱捕的代表的无理判决，保证今后不再有无理殴打居民的类似事件发生。《澳门日报》也对澳葡警方提出严重抗议。澳葡当局在罪证确凿面前，仍然采取蛮不讲理态度。澳门同胞对澳葡当局这种蛮横态度极为愤怒。
    连日来，澳门各阶层，各工会、社团、学校，以及教育、妇女、学生、新闻、工商等各界，纷纷举行声讨会。在各个声讨会上，澳门同胞同仇敌忾，控诉葡萄牙帝国主义对澳门同胞所犯下的滔天罪行。对澳葡当局这次蓄意迫害中国人的血腥暴行提出严重抗议，坚决要求澳葡当局立即执行澳门同胞提出的五项严正要求。特别是要求澳葡当局严办这次血腥暴行的祸首“警察厅第一副厅长”颜端尼，并公开向澳门同胞道歉赔罪。
    澳门同胞严正指出，澳门葡萄牙当局这次迫害中国人的血腥暴行，性质是极为严重的。澳葡当局对这次血腥暴行及其所引起的后果负有完全的责任。我们正在密切注视这一事态的发展和澳葡当局的态度。
