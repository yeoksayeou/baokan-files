Chairman Mao is a genius of humanity. I have deep feelings of friendship for the heroic Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. I believe that under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people will definitely be able to build true communism. Chairman Mao is the great leader of the peoples of the world, a genius of humanity, and a symbol of communism.

Long live Chairman Mao!
