The people of all nationalities in Xinjiang are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seizing the revolution and promoting production, and actively carrying out water conservancy construction.

The headwater reservoir project of the Toutun River in the autonomous region is currently under intensive construction, aiming to intercept floods by next summer. The Toutun River is a small river originating from the Tian Shan Mountains, flowing into the desert downstream. The river water irrigates part of the farmland. After building a reservoir in the upstream valley, it will play a greater role in promoting industrial and agricultural production in the autonomous region.

The main canal of Jinghe County in the Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture has recently been completed and water has been released.

The first phase of the East Canal on the east bank of the Yurungkash River in the Hetian Prefecture of Southern Xinjiang has been completed. The two diversion gates, the main canal, and the east and west branch canals of the first phase have recently been put into operation. With the water source, 200,000 mu of new farmland can be opened up in Luopu County.

    新疆各族人民抓紧水利建设
    据新华社乌鲁木齐一日电　新疆各族人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓革命促生产，积极进行水利建设。
    自治区的头屯河水库工程正在积极施工，争取明年夏季拦洪受益。头屯河是发源于天山的一条小河，下游没入沙漠。河水灌溉着一部分农田。利用上游山谷修建水库后，将对自治区的工农业生产起更大的促进作用。
    博尔塔拉蒙古自治州精河县所修的精河总干渠已在最近完工放水。
    南疆和田专区玉龙喀什河东岸大渠的第一期工程已经完工，第一期所修的两座分水闸、大渠和东西两干渠已于最近放水，有了水源，可使洛浦县新开农田二十万亩。
