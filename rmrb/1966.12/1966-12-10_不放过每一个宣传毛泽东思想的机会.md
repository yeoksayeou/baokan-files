One evening, as we were about to go to sleep, an old peasant ran over four miles to watch our performance. Despite our fatigue, we performed the entire show again from start to finish for the old man.

On November 7, we arrived at Li Jia Zhuang in Cao Dian Brigade, Meng Cheng County, Anhui Province. It was already evening. The commune members working on the threshing floor all warmly greeted us. We put down our bags and started working with them.

After dinner, more than two hundred people came to the place where we were staying, filling the threshing floor in front of our door. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants came in the dark to see us, showing their boundless concern and care for us. We felt this was a good opportunity to promote Mao Zedong Thought, so we briefly discussed and decided to perform a propaganda show.

After marching all day, everyone felt sore all over. However, being able to let the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants receive another education in Mao Zedong Thought was our greatest happiness. So, we read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the commune members, sang songs based on Chairman Mao's quotations. We used group singing, solo singing, fast-paced dialogue, and other forms to promote the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, praise the great leader Chairman Mao, promote the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and promote the excellent domestic and international situation. Our performance was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

By the time the performance ended, it was already past nine o'clock. We were about to go to sleep when suddenly we heard a series of knocking sounds at the door. Opening the door, we saw an old man with white hair.

The old man saw that we were about to sleep and apologized, "Are you going to sleep? Then I won't bother you." Saying this, he turned to leave. We thought that the old man had come to see us at night, so he must have something important to say. So, we warmly invited him to stay. It turned out that he was an old poor peasant, over sixty years old, living four miles away from here. After hearing that the Red Guards had come to promote Mao Zedong Thought, he hurried over after finishing a study session on Chairman Mao's works in his production team. This deeply moved us. Could we let the old man go home disappointed? No, we couldn't. Despite our fatigue, we performed the entire show again from start to finish for the old man. The old man occasionally stroked his white beard, revealing a satisfied smile. He said, "What you said is what Chairman Mao said, and what you performed is the logic of Chairman Mao. I understand it, I can see it, I love to hear it, and I love to see it."

After the performance, we sent four comrades to escort the old man all the way home.

    不放过每一个宣传毛泽东思想的机会
    一天晚上，我们正准备睡觉，一位贫农老大爷跑了四里多路赶来看我们演出。我们不顾疲劳，把刚才向社员们演过的节目，又从头至尾，认认真真地演给老大爷看。
    十一月七日，我们来到了安徽省蒙城县曹店大队李家庄。当时已是傍晚。在打谷场上劳动的社员们，都亲切地和我们打招呼。我们放下背包，就和社员一起干起活来。
    晚饭后，我们住宿的地方来了二百多人，把门前的打谷场挤得满满的。广大贫下中农摸黑来看我们，这是对我们的无限关怀和爱护。我们觉得这正是宣传毛泽东思想的好机会，大家稍稍商量了一下，决定进行宣传演出。
    行军一天，大家都感到浑身酸痛。可是，能让广大贫下中农多受到一次毛泽东思想的教育，这就是我们最大的幸福。于是，我们为社员读《毛主席语录》，唱毛主席语录谱写的歌曲。我们用合唱、表演唱、独唱、快板、对口词等形式宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想，歌颂伟大的领袖毛主席，宣传无产阶级文化大革命，宣传国内外的大好形势。我们的节目受到了广大贫下中农的热烈欢迎。
    演出结束时，已经九点多钟了。我们正准备睡觉，忽然传来了一阵阵的敲门声。开门一看，是一位白发苍苍的老大爷。
    老大爷见我们准备睡觉了，十分抱歉地说：“哎，你们要睡觉了吧，那俺就不打扰你们了。”说着就往外走。我们想，这位老大爷深夜来找我们，一定有什么要紧事。于是，就热情地把他留下来。原来，他是一位老贫农，六十多岁了，家离这里有四里多路。听说这里来了红卫兵，要宣传毛泽东思想，他在生产队里开完学习毛主席著作讲用会，就赶紧跑来了。这使我们十分感动。我们能让他老人家失望吗？不能。我们不顾疲劳，又把刚才演过的节目，从头至尾，认认真真地演给老大爷看。老大爷不时用手抚摸着银白的胡子，露出满意的微笑。他说：“你们讲的是毛主席说的话，演的也是毛主席讲的道理。俺听得懂，看得懂，最爱听，最爱看。”
    演完节目，我们派了四位同志，把老大爷一直送到家。
