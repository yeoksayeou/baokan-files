The radiant "Quotations from Chairman Mao" has not only become the most beloved revolutionary book among the Chinese people but also the most beloved revolutionary book among the peoples of the world. Many foreign revolutionary friends who come to China eagerly hope to obtain a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They call "Quotations from Chairman Mao" the "most precious gift" and "priceless treasure." Many progressive foreign friends, like their Chinese comrades, carry the book with them and study it at any time, regarding it as their guide to action. This shows their boundless love and admiration for our great leader, Chairman Mao.

Beijing's Beijing Hotel, New Overseas Hotel, and Peace Hotel are places where foreigners often stay. The foreign-language editions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" displayed in these hotels for foreigners to read are quickly taken. In just a few days before and after National Day this year, nearly nine hundred copies were taken by foreigners from these three hotels. Many foreign friends, upon seeing the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," are overjoyed, spread the news, and shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" A Japanese foreigner staying at the New Overseas Hotel, after receiving a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," excitedly told the service staff, "I am so happy to get this book!"

Many foreign friends, after obtaining "Quotations from Chairman Mao," study it diligently. Some foreigners who like to play billiards stop playing and even forget to eat, locking themselves in their rooms to read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with all their heart. As one Lao foreigner said, "Seeing this precious book, I forget everything else." A Tanzanian friend, after receiving "Quotations from Chairman Mao," said, "I resolve to study 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' for at least one hour every day from today on."

Many foreign friends also voluntarily organize study groups for "Quotations from Chairman Mao." A Japanese delegation often holds meetings on their own. During the meetings, one person reads the quotations, everyone discusses them, and there is a designated person to take notes.

Some foreign-language editions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" have not yet been translated. Some foreigners ask others to translate and copy them for study. Once, a Somali delegation wanted to study "Quotations from Chairman Mao," but they couldn't find a French edition. So, they asked translators to translate the quotations from the Chinese edition one segment at a time, copying and studying one segment at a time. They used this method to learn several segments of Chairman Mao's quotations.

Many foreign friends express their love for Chairman Mao by reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao" during their visits to China. In Shaoshan, an anti-imperialist warrior from East Africa, after visiting Chairman Mao's former residence, came out and saw many Red Guards. He shouted in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" Then, he proposed that everyone together recite Chairman Mao's quotations: "The people of the whole world, unite! All who refuse to be slaves will win through to liberation! The people of the whole world are our friends, and everybody who is against imperialism is our comrade. Long live the invincible spirit of internationalism!" At that moment, the resounding voices echoed in the majestic valley, inspiring revolutionary people to overcome imperialism. (Picture attached)

    盼宝书　爱宝书　随身带　随时读
    外国革命朋友把《毛主席语录》看作行动指南
    本报讯　红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，不仅已经成为中国人民最喜爱的革命宝书，也成为世界革命人民最喜爱的革命宝书。许多外国革命朋友来到中国，十分渴望得到一本《毛主席语录》。他们把《毛主席语录》称为“最最高贵的礼品”、“无价之宝”。不少外国进步朋友也像中国同志那样，语录随身带，随时学起来，把它看作是行动指南。这表现了他们对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限敬仰。
    北京的北京饭店、新侨饭店、和平饭店是外宾比较集中的地方。这几家饭店所陈列的供外宾取阅的外文版《毛主席语录》，一拿出来很快就被取光了。这三家饭店仅在今年国庆前后几天内就被外宾取走《毛主席语录》近九百册。许多外国朋友一看见红彤彤的《毛主席语录》就欢喜若狂，奔走相告，高呼“毛主席万岁！”住在新侨饭店的一位日本外宾拿到《毛主席语录》后，激动地对服务员同志说：“我能得到这本书，那是太幸福了！”
    许多外国朋友拿到了《毛主席语录》就专心致意地学习。有的外宾喜欢打台球，可是得到《毛主席语录》后，球不打了，饭也顾不得吃，关在屋子里一心一意读《毛主席语录》。正像一位老挝外宾说的：“见了宝书，我是什么都忘了。”有一位坦桑尼亚朋友拿到《毛主席语录》后说：我决心从今天起每天抽出一小时学《毛主席语录》。
    许多外国朋友还自动组织起《毛主席语录》的学习会。有一个日本的代表团，经常自动集会。开会时，由一个人先念毛主席语录，大家讨论，还有专人记录。
    《毛主席语录》，有的外文版还没有翻译出来。一些外宾就请人翻译后抄写来学习。有一次一个索马里代表团想学《毛主席语录》，但是又找不到法文版本。于是他们请翻译同志把中文语录本上的语录一段一段地翻译，翻译一段，抄一段，学一段。他们就用这种办法学会了好几段毛主席语录。
    许多外国朋友在中国参观访问中常常用读《毛主席语录》来表达他们对毛主席的热爱。在韶山，一位来自东非的反帝战士参观完毛主席旧居后出来，看到许多红卫兵小将，就用中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”随后，他提议大家一起念毛主席语录：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”一时，宏亮的声音震荡在雄伟的山谷间，鼓舞着革命人民战胜帝国主义。（附图片）
