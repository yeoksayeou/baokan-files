The call to action from the Cultural Revolution conference in the arts community has greatly inspired and energized the broad masses of professional and amateur artists in the People's Liberation Army. They have expressed their firm resolve to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to strive for the transformation of their worldview, to always be revolutionaries, to perform revolutionary plays, and to dedicate their lives to being propagandists for Mao Zedong Thought.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 6th, the new battle cry issued by the Cultural Revolution conference in the arts community has given the broad masses of professional and amateur artists in the People's Liberation Army a tremendous boost of morale and strength. With surging revolutionary passion, they enthusiastically welcomed the convening of the conference and expressed their most resolute support for the conference's call to action. They will raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in the arts, advance along the direction of arts as indicated by Chairman Mao, and strive to create brilliant new arts for the proletariat. They will dedicate all their efforts to building all military art troupes into propaganda teams for Mao Zedong Thought.

The news of the Cultural Revolution conference in the arts community spread, and the broad masses of professional and amateur artists in the entire army were overjoyed and spread the word to each other. They celebrated this as another great victory for the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. Some art troupes and amateur performance teams quickly prepared artistic programs, beating drums and gongs, and went out into the streets to spread this joyous news to the broad masses of people. Some units held celebration meetings, expressing their strong support for Comrade Jiang Qing's appointment as a cultural advisor to our army and their warm welcome to the Beijing Opera Troupe and other art troupes joining our army's ranks. Everyone agreed that this conference has sounded the battle drums for a total offensive against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road and the reactionary revisionist line in the arts they represent. It has blown the advance signal for carrying the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in the arts to completion, for sweeping away the old and bringing in the new, and for creating new socialist arts for the proletariat. This is a great event of historical significance in China's arts community.

In recent days, the broad masses of artists in the entire army have seriously studied the important speeches made by Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, and Jiang Qing at the conference. Everyone said in discussions that these speeches have provided the most profound and thorough exposition of Chairman Mao's line and direction in the arts, serving as a timely rain for guiding the revolutionary arts forces of the entire nation to advance victoriously along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. The realm of literature and art is an important front in the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The overthrown bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes attempt to use the arts as a battlefield to corrupt and numb the masses' thoughts, preparing the ideological ground for the restoration of capitalism. The proletariat, in order to carry the socialist revolution to completion and to uproot the old sources of revisionism, must carry out a great revolution in the arts, thoroughly reform the old literature and art, sweep away the old and bring in the new, and create new socialist arts for the proletariat, making the arts better serve the socialist economic base.

Artists from the Cultural Work Team of the troops stationed on Hainan Island said, "The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road in the former Beijing Municipal Committee, the former Propaganda Department, and the former Ministry of Culture have persisted in the reactionary revisionist line in the arts, opposing Chairman Mao's line in the arts, allowing emperors, generals, talented scholars, beautiful women, and monsters to all come out; they have also used every means to obstruct the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought, damaging the socialist economic base. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress.' We will resolutely follow the direction in the arts indicated by Chairman Mao, overcome all difficulties and obstacles, fight the ideological battle to eliminate the old and establish the new, and strive to create new arts for the proletariat, letting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high on all arts battlefields, making proletarian arts better serve the socialist economic base." Film workers from the filming team of "South Sea Barrier" at the August First Film Studio said, "In the realm of arts, we must fundamentally sweep out the bourgeois masters, misses, talented scholars, and beautiful women from the stage and screen, letting workers, peasants, and soldiers occupy the socialist arts battlefield and become the true masters of new proletarian arts. We firmly believe that with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, we will definitely be able to sweep away all the old arts of the exploiting classes and definitely be able to produce films that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers love to watch, using Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the socialist screen." Artists from the troops in Jinan, Wuhan, Lanzhou, Chengdu, and other places expressed in discussions their determination to follow the instructions of Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, and Jiang Qing, to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to resolutely implement the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao, to thoroughly criticize the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, to complete the tasks of one struggle, two criticisms, and three reforms, and to turn the cultural work teams and performance teams into propaganda teams for Mao Zedong Thought.

The decision by the Central Military Commission for Comrade Jiang Qing to serve as a cultural advisor to our army has received the strongest support from all artists in the army. Artists from the troops in Shenyang, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Kunming, Fuzhou, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet Military Regions unanimously expressed that this is the great care, great support, and great concern shown by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao for our army's cultural work. Everyone said, "Comrade Jiang Qing has insisted on Chairman Mao's direction in the arts, personally participated in the practical struggle against the reactionary revisionist black line in the arts, and made special contributions to the artistic practice of creating new arts for the proletariat. The decision by the Central Military Commission for her to serve as a cultural advisor to our army will greatly strengthen the leadership of our army's cultural work and greatly accelerate the revolutionization and militarization of our army's cultural work." Comrades from the Soldiers' Drama Troupe of the Political Department of the Guangzhou Troops said, "Comrade Jiang Qing has shown great concern and encouragement for our troupe's performance of 'South Sea Barrier,' watching it four times and repeatedly giving us detailed instructions and suggestions for revision, which has greatly encouraged us. We deeply feel that Comrade Jiang Qing has a good grasp of Mao Zedong Thought, understands it deeply, and applies it firmly and resolutely." Comrades from the Frontline Drama Troupe of the Nanjing Troops heard the joyous news of Comrade Jiang Qing serving as a cultural advisor to our army and excitedly said, "This is a great joyous event in the history of our army's cultural work!" They recalled Comrade Jiang Qing's guidance in the creation and performance of the play "Sentinel Under the Neon Lights," saying that Comrade Jiang Qing had watched our performance twice and convened the editorial and directing personnel to give detailed instructions on the creation and performance of the script, raising the theme of the play to the height of eliminating the old and establishing the new, preventing revisionism and opposing revisionism, and more powerfully propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

During the celebration of the Cultural Revolution conference in the arts community, the broad masses of professional and amateur artists in the entire army have all firmly expressed their determination to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to take "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, to strive for the transformation of their worldview, to always be revolutionaries, to perform revolutionary plays, and to dedicate their lives to being propagandists for Mao Zedong Thought.

    解放军文艺战士坚决响应文艺界文化大革命大会号召
    把全军文艺团体办成毛泽东思想宣传队
    坚定地表示要进一步活学活用毛主席著作，努力改造世界观，永远做革命人，演革命戏，毕生做毛泽东思想的宣传员。
    据新华社六日讯　文艺界无产阶级文化大革命大会发出的新的战斗号召，给了中国人民解放军广大专业和业余文艺工作者以巨大的鼓舞和力量。他们怀着沸腾的革命激情，热烈欢呼大会的召开，表示最坚决地响应大会的号召，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，搞好无产阶级文化大革命，沿着毛主席指引的文艺方向，胜利前进，为努力创造无产阶级光辉灿烂的新文艺，为把部队所有文艺团体建设成为毛泽东思想的宣传队而贡献自己的一切力量。
    文艺界无产阶级文化大革命大会的消息一传出，全军专业和业余文艺工作者就欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告，欢呼这是无产阶级文化大革命的又一新的胜利。有些文艺团体和战士业余演出队赶排了文艺节目，敲锣打鼓，走上街头向广大人民群众宣传这个大喜讯。有些单位举行了庆祝大会，表示热烈拥护江青同志担任我军文化工作顾问，热烈欢迎北京市京剧一团等文艺团体列入我军建制。大家一致认为，这次大会擂起了向文艺界一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和他们所代表的反革命修正主义文艺路线发动总攻击的战鼓，吹响了把文艺界无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，推陈出新，创造无产阶级的社会主义新文艺的进军号角，这是我国文艺界具有伟大历史意义的大事。
    全军广大文艺工作者，连日来认真学习了周恩来同志、陈伯达同志、江青同志在大会上所作的重要讲话。大家在座谈中说，这些讲话，对毛主席的文艺路线、文艺方向，作了最深刻、最透彻的阐述，是引导全国革命文艺大军沿着毛主席指引的文艺方向胜利前进的“及时雨”。文学艺术领域是无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争的一条重要的战线。被推翻了的资产阶级和一切剥削阶级企图利用文艺这一阵地，腐蚀群众，麻痹群众的思想，为复辟资本主义作思想准备。无产阶级为了把社会主义革命进行到底，挖掉产生修正主义的老根，就必须在文艺界进行一场大革命，把旧的文学艺术来一场彻底的大改革，推陈出新，创造无产阶级的社会主义的新文艺，使文艺更好地为社会主义的经济基础服务。
    海南岛驻军战线文工团的文艺工作者说，旧北京市委、旧中宣部、旧文化部一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，坚持反革命修正主义的文艺路线，对抗毛主席的文艺路线，让帝王将相、才子佳人、牛鬼蛇神一齐出笼；他们并千方百计地阻挠宣传毛泽东思想，破坏社会主义的经济基础。毛主席教导我们：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。我们坚决沿着毛主席指引的文艺方向，战胜一切困难和阻力，打好灭资兴无的思想仗，努力创造无产阶级的新文艺，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗永远飘扬在一切文艺阵地上，使无产阶级文艺更好地为社会主义的经济基础服务。八一电影制片厂《南海长城》摄制队的电影工作者说，在文艺领域里，就是要从根本上把资产阶级老爷、小姐、才子佳人统统扫出舞台、银幕，让工农兵占领社会主义文艺阵地，做无产阶级新文艺的真正主人。我们坚信，有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想作指南，我们一定能够扫荡一切剥削阶级的旧文艺，一定能拍摄出广大工农兵喜闻乐见的好影片，用毛泽东思想占领社会主义的银幕。济南、武汉、兰州、成都等部队的文艺工作者在座谈中表示，决心按照周恩来同志、陈伯达同志、江青同志的指示，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，胜利完成一斗二批三改的任务，把文工团、演出队办成毛泽东思想的宣传队。
    中共中央军委决定江青同志担任我军文化工作顾问，得到了全军文艺战士最热烈的拥护。沈阳、广州、南京、昆明、福州等部队和新疆、内蒙古、西藏军区的广大专业和业余文艺战士们一致表示，这是伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席对我军文化工作的极大爱护，极大支持，极大关怀。大家说，江青同志坚持毛主席的文艺方向，亲自参加了同反革命修正主义文艺黑线进行斗争的斗争实践，和创造无产阶级新文艺的艺术实践，作出了特殊的贡献。中央军委决定由她担任我军文化工作顾问，必将大大加强我军文化工作的领导，大大加速我军文化工作的革命化、战斗化。广州部队政治部战士话剧团的同志们说，江青同志对我团演出《南海长城》十分关心，先后看了四次，反复地、细致地给我们作了许多指示，提出修改意见，给了我们极大的关怀和鼓舞。我们深深体会到江青同志对毛泽东思想学习得很好，领会得很深，运用得很活、很坚决。南京部队前线话剧团的同志们听到江青同志担任我军文化工作顾问的喜讯，兴奋地说：“这是我军文化工作史上的一件大喜事！”他们回忆起江青同志指导话剧《霓虹灯下的哨兵》的创作和演出过程说，江青同志曾两次观看我们演出，并且召集编导人员对剧本的创作、表演作了详尽的指示，使这个剧的主题思想提到了灭资兴无、防修反修的高度，更有力地宣传了毛泽东思想。
    全军广大专业和业余文艺工作者在欢庆文艺界无产阶级文化大革命大会时，都坚定地表示要进一步活学活用毛主席著作，以“老三篇”为座右铭，努力改造世界观，永远做革命人，演革命戏，毕生做毛泽东思想的宣传员。
