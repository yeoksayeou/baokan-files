Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, China's livestock industry has achieved a bumper harvest for the fifth consecutive year since 1962.

Statistics from relevant departments show that this year, the number of large livestock such as horses, cattle, mules, and donkeys, as well as pigs and sheep, have all increased to varying degrees compared to last year. According to statistics from seven provinces and municipalities in the north, the growth rate of large livestock is much higher than last year. Provinces like Henan and Shandong have set historical records for the highest growth rates of large livestock. With the strengthening of the promotion of excellent breeds and the improvement of feeding and management, the quality of livestock has generally improved, with the quality of horses and fine wool sheep showing more significant improvements.

The continuous bumper harvest of China's livestock industry is a victory of the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought. It is a victory of putting proletarian politics in a prominent position, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide livestock production across the country.

This year, many regions in southern and northern China have experienced severe droughts, and some northern regions have also been hit by severe wind and snowstorms. This has brought difficulties such as insufficient water for livestock, withered grass, and increased livestock diseases. However, the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have shown a fearless revolutionary heroism to dare to struggle and dare to win. They have launched a mass campaign to combat disasters and protect livestock. The broad masses of farmers and herdsmen have proudly declared: With Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's leadership, no matter how great the difficulties, we will not be defeated. The main pastoral areas of Xinjiang have suffered a severe wind and snow disaster unprecedented in decades, with pastures generally covered by deep snow, usually reaching 60-70 centimeters, and some mountainous areas reaching 2-3 meters. However, the broad masses of herdsmen, following Chairman Mao's teachings: "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," have achieved great victories in combating disasters and protecting livestock despite the fierce winds and heavy snow. The entire state has achieved a livestock survival rate of 96%, and the survival rate of foals, calves, lambs, and piglets has reached over 92%.

Due to the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen's efforts to combat disasters, the livestock survival rate and the survival rate of young livestock such as foals, calves, lambs, and piglets in Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces have all improved compared to last year. This has effectively promoted the development of the livestock industry.

In the development of livestock production, various places have seriously implemented Chairman Mao's policy of integrating agriculture and livestock husbandry. Through actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works and summarizing past experiences, the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen have further understood the interdependent and mutually promoting dialectical relationship between agriculture and livestock husbandry. The awareness of implementing the policy of integrating agriculture and livestock husbandry has greatly improved. Not only has agriculture developed, but livestock husbandry has also developed.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，战胜严重自然灾害
    我国畜牧业今年持续丰收
    马、牛、骡、驴等大牲畜和猪、羊都比去年增长，取得了自一九六二年以来的第五个丰收年景
    据新华社二十六日讯在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导下，我国今年的畜牧业生产，取得了自一九六二年以来的第五个丰收年景。
    有关部门提供的资料表明，今年我国马、牛、骡、驴等大牲畜和猪、羊的头数都比去年有不同程度的增长。另据北方七省市的统计，大牲畜的增长速度比去年要大得多。河南、山东等省大牲畜的增长速度都创造了历史的最高纪录。随着良种推广工作的加强和饲养管理的改善，牲畜的质量普遍有了提高，其中马和绵羊质量的提高更为显著。
    我国畜牧业生产的持续丰收，是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，是各地突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想指导畜牧业生产的胜利。
    今年，我国南北不少地区发生了十分严重的干旱，北方有的地区还遭到了严重风雪袭击；这样，就给我国畜牧业生产带来了畜牧用水不足、牧草干枯和牲畜疫病增多等困难。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大农民和牧民，以敢于斗争，敢于胜利的大无畏的革命英雄气概，开展了群众性的抗灾保畜斗争。广大农民和牧民豪迈地提出：有毛泽东思想，有党的领导，天大的困难也难不倒我们。新疆主要牧区遭到几十年来未有的特大风雪灾害，牧场普遍被深雪覆盖，一般深达六七十厘米，有的山区深达两三米。但广大牧民遵照毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”。伊犁哈萨克自治州许多地区尽管风猛雪大，抗灾保畜斗争却取得了很大的胜利。全州成畜保畜率达百分之九十六，马驹、牛犊、羊羔的成活率达百分之九十二以上。
    由于广大农民和牧民奋起抗灾，宁夏、青海、四川、云南等省区，今年的成畜保畜率和马驹、牛犊、羊羔、仔猪等幼畜的成活率，都比去年又有新的提高，从而有力地促进了畜牧业的发展。
    各地在发展畜牧业生产中，认真执行了毛主席提出的农牧并举的方针。通过活学活用毛主席著作，通过对过去经验的认真总结，广大农民和牧民进一步认识了农业和牧业的相互依存，相互促进和辩证关系，贯彻农牧并举方针的自觉性大大提高。不仅农业发展了，畜牧业也发展了。
