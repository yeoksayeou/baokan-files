Communist warriors discuss serving the people

	No matter what difficulties the masses encounter, when we see them, we must step forward to help them.
		Zhang Side

	Human life is limited, but serving the people is limitless. I will dedicate my limited life to the boundless service of the people.
		Lei Feng

	Chairman Mao said "completely" and "thoroughly" means serving the people wholeheartedly and working for the people. Currently, three-sixths of the world's people are still not liberated and are suffering. A revolutionary soldier must have the ambition to care for the country and look at the world, and not just think about personal interests, but go to liberate the suffering people.
		Wang Jie

	To be a good servant of the people, one must correctly handle mistakes and criticism. If we have shortcomings and mistakes, they will definitely hinder our service to the people. Criticism will help us correct our mistakes and serve the people better. What is there to be afraid of?
		Liu Yingjun

	We are here to serve the people, so we should not be afraid of trouble. The more troublesome the matter, the more we should do it. This is the most basic attitude of serving the people.
		Deng Muguang

	When we do our work, we must do it well. Every task we undertake must be done responsibly for the people, and we must always have high standards and strict requirements.
		Wang Zuming

    共产主义战士谈为人民服务
    不论群众遇到什么困难，咱们看见了都要挺身而出，帮助他们。
                                          张思德
    人的生命是有限的，可是，为人民服务是无限的，我要把有限的生命，投入到无限的“为人民服务”之中去。
                                          雷　锋
    毛主席说的“完全”、“彻底”就是全心全意地为人民服务，为人民工作。世界上现在还有三分之二的人民没有解放，还在受苦受难。一个革命战士要有心怀祖国、放眼世界的雄心壮志，不能只想到个人的一点利益，而不去解放受苦受难的人民。
                                          王　杰
    要当好人民的勤务员，必须正确地对待错误和批评。如果我们有缺点和错误，就一定会妨害我们为人民服务的质量。而开展批评将会帮助我们改正错误，使我们为人民服务的更好。试问这有什么可怕呢？
                                          刘英俊
    我们是为人民服务的，因此就不要怕麻烦，越麻烦的事越要去做，这是为人民服务最基本的态度。
                                          邓木全
    我们干工作一干就要干好，每做一件事情都要向人民负责，时刻都要有高标准、严要求的思想才行。
                                          王祖明
