I often gaze at the Pacific Ocean. Every day the sun rises from this side, and when I see the rising sun, I think of Chairman Mao, and I think of "The East Is Red." Mao Zedong and the red sun in the east have become synonymous. This is indeed the case.

	Vietnam	Phạm Đình Cáp

Chairman Mao Zedong is the true leader of the people. We hold him in great respect because he has shown the people struggling for independence and liberation the way.

	Pakistan	A Student

The red sun in the hearts of the people is Chairman Mao; the place the people yearn for is Beijing's Tiananmen. Seeing Chairman Mao's heroic figure will make one's heart burst with strength.

	Japan	Yokohama

Since the birth of Marx, each era has had a great leader of the international communist movement as its representative. First, there was Marx's era, then Lenin's era. The current era is Mao Zedong's era.

	Mali	A Friend

We revolutionary people love Chairman Mao the most and love to read Chairman Mao's books. Because Chairman Mao always lives among the masses, he understands the hearts of the people the most and knows the sufferings of the people the best. His eyes, his thoughts, are always with the people.

	Algeria	An Old Soldier

Great Chairman Mao has accomplished immortal deeds. Because of his great achievements, the whole world respects him. Our love for Chairman Mao is incomparable and indescribable.

	Nigeria	Abdul

Comrade Mao Zedong is the guide of the world communist movement and the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Salute to the great helmsman, Comrade Mao Zedong.

	Colombia	Hu Ge

I am increasingly aware that Chairman Mao is a great helmsman and a genius. The sea may dry up, the rocks may crumble, but our admiration for Chairman Mao will last for thousands of generations.

	Australia	Kent

Great Mao Zedong is a great leader, a genius of humanity. I sincerely wish him eternal life. He is the symbol of communism.

	Poland	Józef

Comrade Mao Zedong has been correct all along. He is the midwife of the new world that is about to be born. We place our hopes in the great teacher of the world proletariat, Comrade Mao Zedong.

	France	Scout

Comrade Mao Zedong has developed Marxism-Leninism. He is the great genius of contemporary humanity. Every day he is realizing his ideal—to work for the benefit of the whole world. In today's history of the workers' movement and national liberation, all life is connected with the name of Mao Zedong.
